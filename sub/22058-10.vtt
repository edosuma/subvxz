00:01.001 --> 00:02.377
Hello, friends.

00:02.461 --> 00:05.088
Sweet zombie Jesus.
It's Sketchy and Skeezy.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.465
[man] <i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:06.548 --> 00:08.133
-You want to be immortal?
-It's him.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.636
Well, Murphy here has got to bite you.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.473
[man] <i>These visions that you're having,
don't ignore them.</i>

00:14.556 --> 00:17.726
The unconscious is a very powerful thing.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.315
[gun blast]

00:28.529 --> 00:30.239
[Warren] <i>Black Rainbow is real.</i>

00:45.796 --> 00:46.630
[man] Warren?

00:47.965 --> 00:49.466
-Doc?
-[woman] See anybody?

00:49.549 --> 00:51.635
[man] Murphy? I can't see anything.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.888
[people coughing]

01:00.852 --> 01:02.020
Do you see anyone?

01:02.104 --> 01:03.105
No.

01:05.107 --> 01:09.194
This is FUBAR.
This damn foam is choking me out.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.823
[body thuds]

01:15.284 --> 01:17.035
Thanks, cover boy.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.496
We have to find Warren.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.377
Doc, Zs!

01:26.753 --> 01:30.382
Damn if this foam wasn't bad
enough. Now puppies and kittens.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.968
We're surrounded Murphy.
Got to fight it out!

01:33.051 --> 01:35.053
-[growling]
-Let's rock and roll.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.809
They just keep coming.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.812
-Then keep killin'.
-What do you think I'm doing?

01:45.981 --> 01:47.649
Doc, behind you!

01:52.904 --> 01:55.532
Hey, Doc. Look over there!

01:58.368 --> 02:01.872
-Civilization, c'mon!
-Whoa!

02:01.955 --> 02:04.666
-[man 1] Let us in!
-[man 2] Open up!

02:04.750 --> 02:06.126
[men] Pull!

02:09.087 --> 02:11.048
[coughing]

02:12.924 --> 02:13.884
What the--

02:15.761 --> 02:16.637
Sketchy?

02:19.014 --> 02:19.890
Skeezy?

02:21.767 --> 02:24.895
What's up, Doc? Perfect timing.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.315
Hey, you boys want a shave and a haircut?

02:28.398 --> 02:31.485
[makes chicken sound]
Hey, fellas. Long time no see.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.487
A shave?

02:33.570 --> 02:36.823
Well don't mind if I--
Wait a minute. Your beard's all...

02:37.449 --> 02:38.450
It's avant-garde.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.372
[Doc] No no, no, no.
Thanks for the offer.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.748
No, we can't. We got to find Warren.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.168
In this storm?
You got to be kidding me, Doc.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.629
-No, no. It's no joke. She's--
-She's a fine woman.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.506
-Can take care of herself.
-[Sketchy] And me.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.385
-Ain't that the truth.
-That was entendre.

02:56.468 --> 02:59.596
-Are you guys through?
-You know, Warren's changed, a lot.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.098
[Sketchy] Does she still have a pulse?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.725
-Well, yeah.
-Well, then she's my kinda gal.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.978
-[Sketchy and Skeezy chuckle]
-Excuse me, do I know you? Have we met?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.106
Something about your face
is crazy familiar.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.026
[barber] Highly doubtful. But I've been
told I have that kind of face.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.152
[both] Crazy?

03:14.236 --> 03:15.529
Familiar.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.697
Weapons?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.282
Oh, no, no. We got to boogie.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.410
What is it you always say?
Never get out of the boat.

03:21.493 --> 03:25.872
Yeah, but I also always said,
never go back out in the toxic shit.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.708
-I wouldn't go out there.
-Uh... Come on, Doc.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.795
Take a load off. You know, he...

03:31.878 --> 03:33.880
he lathers with Kiehl's.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.049
That's it. I'm in. Where do you want them?

03:37.008 --> 03:39.636
-Weapons.
-In there?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.180
[Doc] Take your own advice, Murphy.
We got to find the Warren and the others.

03:42.264 --> 03:45.809
Warren's probably hunkered down somewhere
waiting for the storm to blow over.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.436
Have any idea how long that's gonna take?

03:47.519 --> 03:49.104
You can't predict the weather.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.275
Nuclear fallout, years of chemicals,

03:54.025 --> 03:56.361
millions of bodies
off-gassing in Lake Michigan.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.406
Then boom! Zombie frappÃ©.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.325
Any more searching, you're bound
to lose her or waste time back-tracking.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.704
-So, you know.
-Yeah. Come on, Doc. Live a little.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.331
This could be our last sliver of paradise.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.251
You know, besides,
Warren's indestructible-ish.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.716
This here's just my walking stick.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.302
And since your sign says walk-ins welcome,

04:20.385 --> 04:23.263
I assume you don't mind
if I just walk in with it?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.347
Really?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.527
You and I are getting
off on the right foot.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.756
[Murphy] Careful not to nick me now.
I'm a bleeder.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.387
Hang in there, chief.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.700
Doc! [coughing]

05:27.327 --> 05:28.537
Murphy!

05:29.830 --> 05:30.831
10K!

05:34.543 --> 05:35.794
Sarge!

05:51.935 --> 05:54.604
[theme music]

06:12.289 --> 06:13.498
Not too much off the top.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.959
Get rid of the scruff
and keep the beard. Capisce?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.128
[barber] Not a problem.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.215
Ahhhh.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.760
[chuckles] I could die
and go to heaven right now.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.138
-[both] Don't say that.
-What's that?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.849
They said you wouldn't be the first.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.310
Oh, daddy, I believe it.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.062
Mm mm mm mm.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.817
-You have steel wool for whiskers.
-Maybe you're losing your edge.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.152
I don't think so.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.579
It's like searching
for a needle in a haystack.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.751
I just can't find the right memory
to remind me.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.135
But I feel so strongly about this.
So your face must have relevance.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.136
Relevance?

07:08.553 --> 07:10.805
Yeah, for me to remember your
face. It must've been important.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.224
I mean, God knows I've forgotten
a shit ton of faces.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.518
Your mind is playing tricks, my friend.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.561
Could be.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.854
Could be.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.398
-Could be--
-Deja vu!

07:21.149 --> 07:23.568
-Third eye.
-Female intuition.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.945
Well telekinesis, then.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.613
-You mean telepathy.
-Uh, no, I don't.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.406
-Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.824
[all] You do.

07:29.908 --> 07:33.912
Listen. Telekinesis is like bending spoons
with your mind.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.666
Telepathy is reading peoples'
thoughts and emotions. Like a psychic.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.918
[Doc] He's right.
I did them both on peyote.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.922
And I definitely tele-transported
with a nice Native American lady.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.256
A medicine woman.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.678
[Murphy snores]

07:49.761 --> 07:51.471
You got to love that son of a bitch.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.599
We're on a one way trip to hell,
and he still finds time for a nap.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.483
Keep still. I don't want to knick you.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.535
Aw, man, you got magic hands.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.829
What's your name again?

08:15.912 --> 08:19.040
Sal, short for Salazar.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.876
Salazar! Albanian Salazar!

08:23.211 --> 08:24.254
Oh, my God, he's Albanian!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.550
I thought I detected an accent.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.844
Yes. Not Albanian. Greek.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.262
Oh! Thank God.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.973
-Albanian's hate us.
-Yeah!

08:35.056 --> 08:36.891
Damn, I thought I had it.

08:36.975 --> 08:40.478
Don't beat yourself up, Bro.
Greece is right next door to Albania.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.106
-Practically neighbors.
-[Sal] Totally different.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.524
Do tell.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.611
Albania is Albania. Greece is Greece.
Macedonia is Macedonia.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.156
Who said anything about Macedonia?

08:51.239 --> 08:55.160
Just an example.
And we invented the sandwich.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.037
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.914
Greece did not invent the sandwich.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.291
It was the Romans.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.419
So they could eat on the go
while raping and pillaging.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.962
Everybody knows this.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.215
[chuckling] Close, but you're all wrong.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.717
1762, England.

09:11.259 --> 09:15.138
John Montagu,
the 4th Earl of Sandwich. No joke.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.183
He had his cook whip up a concoction
of meat and bread,

09:18.266 --> 09:20.894
so he didn't have to leave
the poker table.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.146
-Is that so?
-Mm-hm.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.523
You know,
that reminds me of another invention

09:25.607 --> 09:26.983
named after its inventor.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.862
Sir Thomas Crapper,
who actually holds nine Royal Patents

09:30.945 --> 09:32.989
on siphonic flushing mechanisms.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.074
The toilet?

09:34.616 --> 09:35.575
That too.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.536
Just think.
If it were the other way around,

09:38.620 --> 09:41.164
we'd be eating a crapper
and taking a sandwich.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.132
That's heavy, man.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.057
Don't move.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.147
I still need to take a little off the top.

10:06.231 --> 10:10.693
Man, he gives looks
that would kill. Huh, Skeezy?

10:10.777 --> 10:14.280
Yeah, knocks 'em dead every time.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.242
Drive the ladies crazy!

10:17.325 --> 10:20.286
Quite a cheering section you got there.
You paying them?

10:21.204 --> 10:25.375
You and your friend are all right.
Those two, not so much.

10:25.458 --> 10:30.046
That's the nature of the damn Apocalypse,
like ships passing in the night.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.216
Some you harbor.
The rest you torpedo and sink.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.636
You're funny. Very.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.850
Not, Albania. Albany.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.226
Have you ever been to Albany, New York?

10:43.852 --> 10:46.479
Give it a break, Doc.
He just said he likes us.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.441
OK. Thanks, man. We love you too.
Have you ever been to Albany?

10:50.900 --> 10:51.860
No.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.236
Albuquerque?

10:53.319 --> 10:54.821
Missed it.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.408
Well, next time take a left at Tucumcari.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.244
I got to figure this out.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.665
-I got to meditate.
-[Murphy] Don't burst a blood vessel.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.626
Soon as he's done with me you're next up
on the chopping block.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.011
Ummm.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.679
[ringing sound]

11:19.762 --> 11:23.558
How about that baklava?
What's that all about?

11:23.641 --> 11:24.642
Delicious pastry...

11:40.617 --> 11:44.829
Do you know that a kangaroo
can turn his pouch inside out...

11:44.913 --> 11:46.915
[growling]

12:02.931 --> 12:05.099
[coughing]

12:18.404 --> 12:20.740
[growling sounds]

12:34.170 --> 12:35.213
Wait!

12:43.221 --> 12:46.432
This is great. [chuckles]

12:47.600 --> 12:48.768
Ah.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.145
Spin me around again one last time
so I can check out the back

12:51.229 --> 12:53.064
Grant the man his last request.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.819
You, sir, are an artist.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.489
-I am pleased you are pleased.
-Oh, please.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.324
Do you have a problem with my happiness?

13:03.825 --> 13:05.868
Negativity's infectious, man.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.622
Like a virus.

13:14.961 --> 13:15.795
-[both] Murphy!
-What?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.048
Hey, you want to check out
the tanning bed?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.883
They have a tanning bed?
You have a tanning bed?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.510
Solar powered.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.430
You really have carved out
a tiny niche of heaven here.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889
Yeah. Blood, sweat, and tears.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.933
Mostly blood. Indeed.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.352
Well, I hope you're not
charging an arm and a leg.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.770
-He is.
-I am.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.565
Well, then take his. Doc, you're up next.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.611
Me, I'm gonna go get rid of my tan lines.
That really was a close shave.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.281
Yeah, I wouldn't split hairs
with this man over the price.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.615
I was talking about the shave.

13:44.699 --> 13:47.118
Oh, yeah. Smooth as a baby's bottom.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.037
You're damaged.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.958
-If things get hairy--
-Scream like a porn star.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.211
Something like that.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.054
[Murphy] Oh, Terry cloth.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.028
Hey. Whoa!

14:22.111 --> 14:24.364
-Looking good.
-You're not getting in my pants.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.698
You're not wearing any.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.494
Fair enough.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.704
<i>âª Ta-dah âª</i>

14:31.788 --> 14:32.955
Really?

14:33.039 --> 14:34.123
You seem unimpressed.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.585
-I dunno. It's kinda...
-Intimate, huh?

14:37.668 --> 14:38.503
I guess.

14:44.342 --> 14:48.262
So you... you might want to sign these.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.430
-Why?
-For protection.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.390
Get out.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.226
-No, no. Just sign here at the bottom.
-No, just get out right now. Go.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.019
Down at the bottom-- Ah!

15:02.652 --> 15:06.364
[Doc] Damn, man.
I know your face. I know I know you.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.865
It's right here.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.368
How do you want it cut?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.912
Um, I dunno.
I guess just a little off the top.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.664
I dunno, Doc. Your hair
looks pretty good to me.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.500
Aw, thanks, man.
Actually I just cut it myself.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.629
How bout a wax and a trim?
And I got some fierce nose hairs

15:21.712 --> 15:23.589
that could use a good bushwhacking.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.632
Hey, do you shampoo?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.927
-We scalp massage.
-Ooh, awesome. Yeah, let's do that.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.011
[whispering]

15:34.058 --> 15:35.351
-[growling]
-[screams]

15:35.435 --> 15:36.727
Sorry. Sorry.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.315
[growling]

15:41.399 --> 15:44.819
Oh, Murphy was right.
You do have magic hands.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.280
Must be a Greek thing.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.949
Hm, along with oils, yogurt,
and brotherly love.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.451
-Oh, and democracy.
-Yeah, that.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.077
Even the Greeks made mistakes.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.165
You fresh off the boat, Greek?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.129
By way of Detroit.

16:03.212 --> 16:07.425
Motor city, baby. Far out.
I had some good times there.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.180
Did you ever hear of a fella named
Nicky La Pieu?

16:12.263 --> 16:14.140
Most people called him Tony Cue Ball.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.642
I don't know why.
He had hair down to his knees.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.061
Never heard of him.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.230
-You sure?
-Definitely.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.024
Too bad. He was a trip.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.819
Kind of an ass,
but too stupid to do much harm.

16:26.903 --> 16:30.490
Come to think of it, the last time I saw
him must've been six or seven years ago.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.824
It was just right after--

16:31.908 --> 16:36.579
Holy Moses! I knew it!
Tony Cue Ball! You son of a bitch!

16:36.662 --> 16:39.332
-[gasping]
-[growling]

16:42.084 --> 16:42.960
Bastard!

16:54.597 --> 16:55.431
[gunfire]

17:05.358 --> 17:08.903
[footsteps]

17:08.986 --> 17:10.446
[Tony clears throat]

17:12.406 --> 17:14.992
"Say hello to my little friend."

17:16.827 --> 17:19.455
[gunfire]

17:30.633 --> 17:32.260
[both] We tried to warn you.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.886
Well next time, try harder.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.515
[snickers]

18:27.440 --> 18:28.691
[overlapping shouting]

18:28.774 --> 18:30.401
-[man 1] Chill out, man!
-[man 2] Shut up!

18:36.782 --> 18:39.410
Easy. We'll kill them soon enough.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.412
I thought we were friends.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.832
He ain't a friend. He's not even a barber.
You should see the back of your head.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.960
This is not personal.
It's never been personal.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.712
Wait a minute.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.964
He kicked your ass once, didn't he?

18:52.048 --> 18:53.466
[Doc] More like sucker punched.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.968
This jackass and his buddy,
not Gossamer here,

18:56.052 --> 18:58.679
jumped me, took everything
I had, including my undies,

18:58.763 --> 18:59.847
and left me there to die.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.641
You stole his underwear?

19:01.724 --> 19:03.267
I was desperate. It was black summer.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.061
But a man's boxers?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.395
It was business.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.855
Hell of a business.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.400
What?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.110
Nothing. I'm just trying to figure
out a way out of this.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.737
[Murphy] Well, that's what
I'm trying to do too.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.905
[Doc] Really?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.282
Hey, you want us to spit shine the place?

19:18.366 --> 19:19.325
I'll grab the Pine-Sol.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.077
[groans]

19:22.453 --> 19:24.914
Speak again and I peel your skin.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.749
[doorbell jingles]

19:26.832 --> 19:29.168
If that's who I think it is,
you fellas are toast.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.129
Who cares what he's talking about.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.007
-Shoot first. No questions.
-I wouldn't do that.

19:36.801 --> 19:40.137
Well, of course they're stalling.
You take me for an idiot?

19:40.221 --> 19:41.138
Is that a trick question?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.140
[doorbell jingles]

19:43.224 --> 19:44.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.062
If that's who they think it is out there,
you're gonna want her alive.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.022
-Her?
-Oh, yeah. Whoo.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.899
-[chuckles]
-Mama brings the pain.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.818
[Tony] Quiet!

19:53.901 --> 19:55.069
Act normal.

19:55.152 --> 19:55.986
Normal?

19:56.070 --> 19:58.364
Like you're not being robbed.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.990
A robbery? Is that what this is?

20:00.074 --> 20:02.493
I totally thought you two
were a couple of sadists

20:02.576 --> 20:04.203
-out for a good time.
-No, they're capitalists.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.996
Shut the hell up!

20:06.956 --> 20:11.210
You are the chattiest bunch of marks
in the whole damn Apocalypse!

20:11.293 --> 20:12.878
[doorbell jingles]

20:12.962 --> 20:14.922
You have to pull.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.804
Anybody ever read <i>The Monkey's Paw?</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:27.685
-Don't...! Don't shoot.
-We are unarmed.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.769
[coughing]

20:31.939 --> 20:33.357
Ran out of ammo.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.069
All that damn foam.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.488
You two look like you smell.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.323
That is a compliment.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.159
[groans] That foam is nasty.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.245
-[blows nose]
-[all groan]

20:46.328 --> 20:47.705
What's the matter?

20:47.788 --> 20:49.832
You never see a woman
blow her nose before?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.585
[all groan]

20:53.711 --> 20:55.171
I don't feel so good.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.650
[all retching]

21:49.850 --> 21:52.770
Wait! I need your help!

21:59.652 --> 22:02.321
-[groans]
-[Tony] This is still a robbery!

22:03.948 --> 22:05.991
[shouting]

22:06.075 --> 22:07.827
[screaming]

22:38.357 --> 22:40.609
[gunfire continues]

22:40.693 --> 22:41.860
[gunfire stops]

22:41.944 --> 22:44.321
[zombies growling]

22:45.990 --> 22:48.117
I'm getting too old for this shit.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.453
Me too.
You were supposed to be my last score.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.122
I'm seriously skeptical of that statement.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.290
Shut up.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.627
Fate is giving us a chance
to reconcile our past.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.546
How the hell is this reconciling?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.756
Because this time, I will kill you.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.675
Tan mom!

23:10.014 --> 23:12.891
-[gunfire continues]
-[all groan]

23:31.285 --> 23:32.369
Tiny!

23:38.751 --> 23:39.752
[gasping]

23:44.465 --> 23:45.299
Tiny?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.551
Take that thing out of here.

23:49.803 --> 23:50.804
What the...?

23:51.847 --> 23:52.806
Ahh! She bit me!

23:54.350 --> 23:55.893
-She bit you!
-That's what I said. She bit me.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.227
-Me too.
-She bit you?

23:57.311 --> 23:58.312
No, she bit you.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.064
-But you said that--
-She bit you.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.445
-Am I gonna tan?
-No, little buddy.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.865
You're gonna Z.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.158
[groans]

24:18.540 --> 24:20.584
[coughing]

24:57.955 --> 24:59.748
[continues coughing]

25:01.291 --> 25:02.418
[groans]

25:20.102 --> 25:23.063
Get me out of here, Sketchy!
Man, I don't want to die! Not like this.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.982
You're not gonna die, OK?

25:25.065 --> 25:26.817
You might be going Z,
but you're not gonna die.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.569
-Here, grab that.
-What?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.904
The barbicide. It'll kill anything.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.121
[gulping]

25:42.458 --> 25:44.042
[gasping]

25:44.126 --> 25:45.586
-Did you just drink that?
-Yeah.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.379
-Do you feel any better?
-No.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.506
OK, you weren't supposed to drink it.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.553
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait one minute.
Just one minute, all right?

25:54.636 --> 25:56.305
Then you can do whatever you want to him.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.809
Give him a minute, for Chrissakes.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.854
All right, let's all be calm here.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.649
Let's step through this logically, huh?

26:07.733 --> 26:11.612
We've held Skeezy here for a while,
and he hasn't turned yet, has he?

26:11.695 --> 26:13.906
-Proof is in the pudding.
-Yeah, I agree.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.366
If he hasn't turned by now,
bacon lady didn't get him.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.409
Explain the bite.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.037
-OK, I bit him.
-[all] You bit him?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.956
-You bit me?
-Yeah.

26:23.916 --> 26:24.750
I did.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.043
Scout's honor.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.046
-Why didn't you speak up?
-Because I knew you wouldn't believe me.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.676
Put it away, broheim.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.263
Don't be stupid.
The bullet will go right through you.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.557
-Two for the price of--
-OK! Fine! Shoot us both!

26:40.641 --> 26:43.143
But what are you gonna
do when we go Mad-Z, huh? Huh?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.812
You can't kill two crazies.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.855
Not with a pair of .45s and...

26:47.940 --> 26:49.024
three bullets.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.193
Cut off their arms and legs.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.403
Then throw them in the basement
with the rest of the Zs.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.572
-What?
-That'd do the trick.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.574
-Who's side are you on?
-Yeah.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.702
-Sorry.
-Wait, there are Zs in the basement?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.414
Doc, Doc, buddy, come on, man.

27:04.498 --> 27:07.167
Now, hey, I know you ain't
keen on these fellas here, Sal.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.045
Oh I'm sorry,
is it still Sal or is it Tony?

27:10.128 --> 27:13.340
-Why would I lie about my name?
-Because you lied about everything else.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.592
I'm sorry. Scratch that.
That is not productive.

27:15.676 --> 27:19.096
My point is,
let's do these fellas justice.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.558
Cutting off arms and legs
seems just. At least to me it does.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.852
See, it's like Kansas City
all over again, Sketch.

27:24.935 --> 27:28.605
-My arms, my legs, I mean, I need them.
-You're already strange-looking.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.357
-Seriously, you guys.
-This is just ridiculous.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.150
[commotion]

27:32.234 --> 27:35.445
Enough! Enough! Enough!

27:36.029 --> 27:37.197
All right.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.449
We're going do this the old fashioned way.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.659
Dissolve them in acid?

27:40.742 --> 27:43.036
No, we're not gonna dissolve them in acid.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.998
It sucks,
but fate has chosen to screw you.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.167
We play by one rule.
Survival of the fittest.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.420
We toss him out on his ass,
let Darwin do the rest.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.589
Murphy.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.757
How could you?

27:55.841 --> 27:57.843
We're talking about Skeezy here.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.094
Yeah, Murphy.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.388
After all we've been through.

28:01.471 --> 28:05.267
Yeah, um... uh-uh.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.854
Sketchy, I know you two are tight.
Skeezy's been a good friend to you.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.647
What do you think we should do?

28:11.648 --> 28:14.234
I say we let him go.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.986
Listen, OK?

28:16.069 --> 28:19.573
If anybody's shooting this
weaselly man right here, it's gonna be me.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.867
You knew this going in.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.369
Mercy you, mercy me.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.832
Butch and Sundance,
Bonnie and Clyde, Hall and Oats.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.459
That was always the plan.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.837
Yeah, but they... they died together.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.631
What?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.258
Let's not get carried away.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.761
Listen, um...

28:40.844 --> 28:42.179
Uh...

28:43.138 --> 28:44.806
Can I do it? Please.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.354
There's one in the chamber. Make it count.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.827
No, no, no. You wanna play roulette?

29:05.911 --> 29:07.621
That's what you want to play? All right.
[cackles]

29:07.704 --> 29:11.041
I'll play. I'll play. And you'll pay!

29:11.124 --> 29:13.961
Yeah! I'll go mad, son!

29:14.044 --> 29:17.172
-Like... [mimics crazy person] mad!
-[Sketchy] OK.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.841
OK. Calm down there, bud.

29:19.925 --> 29:24.304
You got so much to live for
in the next eight to ten minutes.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.560
-Keep going.
-OK. Yeah.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.938
I say we heed Murphy's advice.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.232
I'm sorry, what... what advice was that?

29:35.315 --> 29:37.317
That, the bit about rules.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.736
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the Darwin thing.
Yeah, yeah, do that.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.822
Yeah, the Darwin thing.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.492
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about freedom!

29:45.575 --> 29:48.495
I'm talking about free will! Independence!

29:49.121 --> 29:50.539
Choice.

29:50.622 --> 29:55.377
I'm talking about a man
wrestling fate into his hands, you know?

29:56.003 --> 29:59.464
I'm talking about riding
on the wings of destiny.

29:59.548 --> 30:00.674
[Skeezy] Oh, yeah!

30:00.757 --> 30:02.843
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm looking for.

30:02.926 --> 30:03.802
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.639
I like my idea better.
Chop off his arms and legs.

30:07.723 --> 30:11.685
Put that down.
Sometimes the best weapon is upstairs.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.729
I'm gonna need your buddy's hat.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.897
[both] What do you need his hat for?

30:16.523 --> 30:18.275
All right, let's count the ballots.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.320
Chop off limbs.

30:22.696 --> 30:23.864
Exile.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.158
Cut off limbs.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.410
Another limbs.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.619
Exile.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.455
Exile.

30:32.873 --> 30:33.874
It's a tie.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.834
Somebody didn't vote.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.301
Murphy, did you vote?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.762
Hm? Oh, yeah, no.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.972
After Gore v. Bush,
it didn't seem worth it anymore.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.058
Not then. Now.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.185
Yeah, no. It didn't seem
worth it now either.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.812
[gasps] No wonder
we live in a failed state.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.814
Please, Murphy.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.192
All right. What are you
giving me for my vote?

31:00.275 --> 31:01.610
His undying loyalty.

31:02.986 --> 31:07.115
That's it? I mean for a life?
Loyalty? [scoffs] What a rip.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.492
Who's got the pen?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.788
[doorbell jingles]

31:13.914 --> 31:14.790
[all] Pull!

31:14.873 --> 31:17.751
[coughing and retching]

31:19.711 --> 31:21.213
Outside!

31:23.131 --> 31:25.717
[retching]

31:40.232 --> 31:42.275
[man thuds on floor]

31:47.239 --> 31:49.366
No need to get yer knickers ruffled.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.868
Ah!

31:51.952 --> 31:54.287
Things already went to pot, I see.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.664
What's his deal?

31:55.747 --> 31:57.374
These guys want to throw him outside.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.668
[overlapping chatter]

32:02.754 --> 32:04.005
This is a real cock-up.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.466
Yeah. I mean just put him out
of his misery. Toss him outside.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.552
-Mm-hm.
-Do you want to vote?

32:10.595 --> 32:11.972
[both] I think we just did.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.560
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
Let me say goodbye.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.688
Make it fast. And no funny business.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.996
Mmm. Mmm.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.299
Why didn't you ever say anything?

32:48.258 --> 32:49.885
I didn't think I had to.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.013
I love you.

32:54.598 --> 32:55.599
I know.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.812
Yeah?

33:01.771 --> 33:02.731
I know you.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.108
Just do it already! Just do it!

33:05.692 --> 33:07.027
Ow! Ow!

33:07.110 --> 33:08.195
Hold still, Dale!

33:11.281 --> 33:12.282
I'm cured!

33:13.700 --> 33:15.702
Yeah, sorry pal. I don't think so.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.621
No. No, I know him!

33:21.458 --> 33:23.335
I think this son of a bitch bit me!

33:24.461 --> 33:26.922
Yeah. Yeah, he bit me too.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.049
-Right here.
-Aww.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.012
All right. Good luck, buddy.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.390
No!

33:38.517 --> 33:39.768
Love's a bitch, huh?

33:39.851 --> 33:42.145
-No offense.
-None taken.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.772
Ahh.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.694
[man screams]

33:59.955 --> 34:02.040
Yeah, all right! We get it! You're dead!

34:03.458 --> 34:04.334
Sketchy?

34:05.293 --> 34:07.837
-Do you maybe want to say a few words?
-Uh, yeah.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.799
Mitts in the air, you bloody wankers.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.845
That's right, everybody. In the air!

34:15.929 --> 34:18.390
This here's a good old fashioned stick-up!

34:19.558 --> 34:20.684
Come on.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.400
-[Tony] Taste of my own medicine.
-Karma, baby.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.902
Just rip off the fig leaf.
It's less painful that way.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.947
[chuckles] Tidy whiteys?

34:35.448 --> 34:38.034
-Used to be.
-No wonder he stole your boxers.

34:38.660 --> 34:42.330
Funny how life's most negative moments
have the longest lasting impact.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.292
-You don't have many friends, do you?
-All of them are dead.

34:45.375 --> 34:46.585
[clicking sound]

34:46.668 --> 34:48.628
You're family.

34:48.712 --> 34:51.840
I don't give a rat's ass
about these other folks.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.551
No offense.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.888
Something about you ain't right.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.057
I've been... I've been
told I have a screw loose.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.934
No. That ain't it.

35:04.102 --> 35:04.936
[sniffs]

35:05.020 --> 35:06.104
Now what are we gonna do with them?

35:06.688 --> 35:09.232
I dunno. I hadn't thought that far ahead.

35:09.316 --> 35:12.569
Well whatever you do, don't put us
in that basement right there.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.072
No, I'm serious. Please.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.867
Please don't put us in there.
I can't go down there.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.619
What's in the basement?

35:20.702 --> 35:21.870
Nothing.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.663
It's cold and it's dark.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.100
And I just... I can't go down there.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.252
I'm scared of confined spaces.

35:29.336 --> 35:30.587
Brilliant.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.506
No, no. It's not brilliant.
It's not brilliant.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.924
I'm asking you. I'm begging you.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.761
Please don't put us
into that basement right there.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.013
Could be a trap.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.306
Where is the booty?

35:42.349 --> 35:43.475
It's in the basement?

35:46.895 --> 35:47.771
[grunts]

35:47.854 --> 35:48.938
[coughs]

35:49.022 --> 35:52.442
Sorry about that.
Dale can be a little bit rough.

35:52.525 --> 35:56.112
He hears your mate say,
"No, no, not in the basement,"

35:56.196 --> 36:00.075
when in fact that's exactly
where you want to be, ain't it?

36:00.784 --> 36:02.160
Tell the truth.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.455
Don't be clever.
You can't hide. Not from me.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.581
[snickers]

36:06.665 --> 36:09.626
Our goose's up top!
Everybody in the basement!

36:31.481 --> 36:33.692
-Seems OK to me!
-I knew it was you!

36:33.775 --> 36:35.860
[commotion]

36:44.911 --> 36:47.664
-Whoo! Now that's Darwin, baby!
-Shut up.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.709
-[groaning]
-[slashing]

36:50.792 --> 36:53.128
[machine gun fire]

36:53.211 --> 36:55.338
[machine gun fire stops]

36:55.422 --> 36:59.134
[footsteps]

37:04.097 --> 37:06.391
OK. Time to end this.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.977
He dies. She dies.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.020
Everybody dies.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.731
Wait. Uh...

37:12.814 --> 37:16.067
Don't you want to make a speech
or say any last words?

37:16.151 --> 37:17.777
Aren't they the same thing?

37:17.861 --> 37:19.738
Oh, no. No, no, no.
They're totally different.

37:19.821 --> 37:24.200
I mean, one could be a pep talk.
The other one could be the Lord's prayer.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.327
[doorbell jingles]

37:42.510 --> 37:43.678
[jingling continues]

37:46.931 --> 37:48.349
[explosion]

37:49.309 --> 37:52.145
Live by the door, die by the door.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.653
Whoo! Closing time! [chuckles]

38:00.737 --> 38:03.364
You? You brought the damn house down.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.909
-You can say that again.
-Don't. Don't.

38:11.706 --> 38:15.126
-Hey, man. What took you so long?
-Oh, green foam, green truck.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.921
You swallowed the key, didn't you?

38:22.509 --> 38:23.593
It's all right.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.845
[both chuckle]

38:25.929 --> 38:28.640
Hold on. You guys had this planned
the whole time?

38:28.723 --> 38:29.891
[both] Of course.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.851
I mean we tried to cut you in, man.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.770
Yeah, we didn't see that bit
with you and old Sal though.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.022
No, that almost derailed the whole thing.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.983
-Coinkydinks.
-Yeah, <i>deus ex machina.</i>

38:39.067 --> 38:40.777
<i>Deus Ex Machina.</i>

38:40.860 --> 38:42.278
<i>-Kismet.</i>
-Horse shit.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.073
You two morons aren't masterminds.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.700
Yeah, well it's either that
or we're lying.

38:47.784 --> 38:51.996
I believe them when they're lying.
I get scared when they're not.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.915
And I was scared. Really.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.208
-You believe them?
-I do.

38:57.043 --> 39:00.129
It doesn't make any sense.
To go through all of this for what?

39:00.213 --> 39:01.339
[both] Retirement.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.050
Yeah, man.
We're taking over the Barber Shop.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.512
-We're gonna practice the tonsorial arts.
-Lifelong dream come true.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.973
I wouldn't know. I had mine removed.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.562
We need to find Warren.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.035
[man] Get up.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.169
You have to get up.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.598
You have to keep moving.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.287
Everything depends on you.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.831
Warren!

40:20.376 --> 40:21.961
<i>I won't be there to help you.</i>

40:28.843 --> 40:32.805
Hey. You OK? We've been looking for you.

40:36.851 --> 40:37.852
This the way?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.360
[blows nose]

40:46.361 --> 40:49.280
[chuckles] You're such a wuss.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.204
So what do you think'll happen
with Wheezy and Fschizzle?

40:56.287 --> 40:59.207
Those crazy bastards.
They're following their own dream.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.591
[whistling]

41:13.262 --> 41:17.058
Ah, this is the life, Skeezy,
just you and me.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.643
You know what we need to do next?

41:18.726 --> 41:20.353
-Make out again?
-Get a dog. What?

41:21.062 --> 41:23.773
-Oh, get a dog? Yeah, get a dog.
-Yeah.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.149
Do you think there's any of them left?

41:25.233 --> 41:27.235
Oh, I'm sure. Somewhere.

41:27.944 --> 41:30.113
Well here, let me see.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.614
Voila!

41:31.698 --> 41:33.074
Huh? What do you think?

41:33.992 --> 41:35.576
Skeezy.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.163
-It's perfect.
-Yeah!

41:39.247 --> 41:40.289
I love it!

41:40.373 --> 41:42.166
[zombies growl]

41:42.250 --> 41:43.710
[pounds foot]

41:46.254 --> 41:48.256
[chuckles]

41:49.924 --> 41:51.092
-Ahh.
-Whoo!

41:51.175 --> 41:55.054
So, you ready to kill the competition?

41:56.180 --> 41:58.141
[clicks teeth] I was born ready.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.518
-[laughs]
-Right.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.646
Whoo!

42:03.730 --> 42:06.816
-Oh.
-[continues laughing]

42:14.532 --> 42:16.534
[continues laughing]
