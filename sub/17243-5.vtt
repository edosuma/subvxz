00:02.910 --> 00:04.311
Moirira and Johnny: (Moans of
passion) Oh yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

00:04.345 --> 00:07.080
David: Could you spare some a...
Oh my go-oh my God!

00:07.115 --> 00:09.149
- Moira: (Shrieks) David!
- Johnny: Where's my robe?!

00:09.183 --> 00:10.317
David: Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God.

00:10.351 --> 00:11.751
Oh my God, what's happening?

00:11.785 --> 00:14.287
I saw hell is what's happening.
Oh my God.

00:14.322 --> 00:16.021
What? (Door opens)

00:16.056 --> 00:17.289
- David: Oh my God.
- Johnny: David,

00:17.324 --> 00:19.726
what you just saw
was your mother and me...

00:19.760 --> 00:21.694
- David: I know what I saw.
- Johnny: having an intimate moment.

00:21.729 --> 00:23.295
- David: I cannot unsee that!
- Alexis: Oh my God, you poor thing!

00:23.330 --> 00:24.664
Johnny: Okay, and I
refuse to feel guilty

00:24.698 --> 00:26.799
about being in bed with my wife.

00:26.834 --> 00:29.035
- Alexis: Ew! Ew! Ew!
- Moira: I hate to be the one to tell you,

00:29.069 --> 00:32.304
but having sex is not just
about making children

00:32.339 --> 00:34.973
so they can grow up and make
you feel bad about having sex.

00:35.008 --> 00:36.875
Oh my God,
can you stop this please?!

00:36.910 --> 00:39.178
Moira: I will not be shamed.
Shame on you.

00:39.212 --> 00:40.679
David: Shame on you for
attempting that position

00:40.713 --> 00:41.980
at 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:42.015 --> 00:43.882
- Moira: John?
- Johnny: You know what?

00:43.917 --> 00:46.485
- David: Oh my God.
- Do you know how difficult it is for us

00:46.520 --> 00:48.687
to share a wall with you two?

00:48.721 --> 00:50.923
- David: I do now.
- Johnny: Yes, well, if you don't mind,

00:50.957 --> 00:52.724
we are now going back
into our room

00:52.759 --> 00:54.626
and don't even think
about opening that door!

00:54.661 --> 00:58.964
- Moira: Are you serious?
- Johnny: Next time.

00:58.998 --> 01:01.499
David: (Under his breath) Oh my God.
(Gags)

01:01.534 --> 01:03.368
Alexis: (Whimpers) No, no, no...

01:11.677 --> 01:13.144
Johnny: Roland, I just
need the door fixed.

01:13.179 --> 01:14.345
- Roland: Mm-hmm?
- Johnny: Okay?

01:14.380 --> 01:16.181
My family can't keep living
like this.

01:16.215 --> 01:18.749
My wife and I,
we have no privacy.

01:18.784 --> 01:21.919
Okay, all right.
I get what this is about.

01:21.954 --> 01:25.022
You and the wife wanna bump
the old uglies, huh?

01:25.057 --> 01:27.892
Roland: (Laughs)
Johnny: I have no idea what that means.

01:27.926 --> 01:30.661
Having a little problem down there
below there, Johnny boy, huh?

01:30.696 --> 01:32.964
No, there's no problem, Roland,
I just need the locks fixed!

01:32.998 --> 01:35.232
It's okay, I get it.
I get it, captain.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.901
You've been a out to sea
for a while

01:36.935 --> 01:38.502
you wanna bring the boat
into port

01:38.536 --> 01:42.306
and maybe...
get your mast scrubbed.

01:42.340 --> 01:45.242
What're you guys down to now?
Like... twice a day?

01:45.276 --> 01:48.178
Okay, this is a conversation you
and I will never have, all right?

01:48.213 --> 01:50.180
I just need the door fixed.

01:50.215 --> 01:51.615
Well, how 'bout I do you
one better?

01:51.649 --> 01:53.484
We got a cabin up by the lake.

01:53.518 --> 01:56.686
It's just a little love nest
for the lady and me.

01:56.721 --> 01:59.756
You know, when we wanna spark
the old spark from time to time.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.725
My gift to you and yours
for the night.

02:01.759 --> 02:03.927
So generous,
but I'm gonna take a pass.

02:03.961 --> 02:05.962
- Jocelyn: Hey, Johnny.
- Johnny: Jocelyn?

02:05.997 --> 02:08.231
- Jocelyn: How are you?
- Johnny: Uh, good. Good.

02:08.264 --> 02:10.574
Roland: Sex life's in the crapper.
I just offered him the cabin.

02:10.595 --> 02:11.934
That is so not true.

02:11.968 --> 02:14.099
- Jocelyn: I knew something was wrong.
- Johnny: N-nothing is wrong.

02:14.119 --> 02:15.340
You should take the cabin.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.573
I wouldn't wanna see your
relationship get any worse.

02:17.608 --> 02:20.943
No, our relationship is fine.
It's just a privacy issue...

02:20.977 --> 02:23.027
Roland: Johnny, Johnny, come
on, come on, come on, come on.

02:23.047 --> 02:26.215
Take the cabin, okay?

02:26.250 --> 02:30.085
And feel free to use
the restraints.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.287
- We keep 'em under the bed, so...
- Johnny: Thank you. Thank you.

02:32.321 --> 02:33.822
- Jocelyn: Pick a safe word.
- Roland: Mm.

02:33.857 --> 02:36.025
Johnny: (Sighs)

02:36.059 --> 02:38.593
I, for one, think we should
take them up on their offer.

02:38.628 --> 02:40.562
I can't believe
what I'm hearing here.

02:40.596 --> 02:43.431
We're talking about
Roland's place.

02:43.466 --> 02:45.800
Who knows what the hell
we're gonna find up there?

02:45.834 --> 02:48.113
Moira: Well, we can't share
any real intimacy here

02:48.133 --> 02:50.148
in this internment camp, John,

02:50.168 --> 02:52.469
and I don't want to turn
into my parents.

02:52.489 --> 02:54.268
Separate beds, separate rooms.

02:54.288 --> 02:55.968
Well, separate countries.

02:55.988 --> 02:57.612
Exactly! A bad marriage!

02:57.647 --> 03:00.848
Hey, if you're willing to give
this a shot, I'm game.

03:00.883 --> 03:02.663
- Moira: You're game.
- Johnny: Yeah.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.153
Moira: Okay. I'll play.

03:05.187 --> 03:08.823
Actually, I have a good feeling
about this, John.

03:08.857 --> 03:11.293
Johnny: You know, I'm starting to
get a pretty good feeling myself.

03:11.313 --> 03:13.194
Are you?

03:13.228 --> 03:15.803
David: Oh my God! Am I being
punished for something?

03:15.823 --> 03:17.964
David, are you dirty
peeping tom?

03:17.999 --> 03:20.349
I don't' think parenting books would
approve of you saying that to me.

03:20.369 --> 03:21.935
I'm here to grab a magazine,

03:21.969 --> 03:24.338
and go back and leave you guys
to whatever disgusting...

03:24.372 --> 03:26.405
- Moira: Stay.
- Johnny: Stick around, stick around.

03:26.425 --> 03:28.875
- Moira: Alexis?
- Johnny: Alexis!

03:29.837 --> 03:32.246
They're done!

03:32.584 --> 03:34.447
Your father and I have
some very important news.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.001
If you tell me
that you're pregnant,

03:36.021 --> 03:37.517
I'm gonna vomit
on this floor right now.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.686
- Moira: Oh, can you imagine?
- Johnny: We're planning a trip.

03:39.721 --> 03:43.356
- David: Okay.
- Johnny: Just to a cabin, overnight...

03:43.390 --> 03:45.325
And we request
that the two of you

03:45.359 --> 03:48.661
not try to contact us
for the next 24 hours.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.909
I really appreciate you
doing that for me.

03:50.929 --> 03:52.587
I'm doing it for us.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.100
Well, it's to my benefit.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.421
Alexis: Um, why don't you guys
stay at the cabin for longer?

03:56.441 --> 03:58.221
Oh, I would never just
abandon you two

03:58.241 --> 04:00.340
in a motel
in the middle of nowhere.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.406
David: Didn't you once take the
wrong baby home from preschool?

04:02.426 --> 04:04.657
Alexis looked Chinese
as an infant.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.812
How many times
must I defend myself?

04:06.847 --> 04:08.847
So we're good then? Thank you.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.616
- David: No, thank you.
- Johnny: No, thank you.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.831
- David: Honestly, thank you.
- Johnny: Enough, David!

04:13.851 --> 04:17.589
Moira: Thank you so much for the
loan of your cabin and your truck.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.725
Roland: Looks like you folks
got a lot of gear here, huh?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.993
Is that the tickle trunk?
(Smarmy laugh)

04:22.027 --> 04:24.896
It's just clothes.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.497
Roland: Yeah, okay,
but just keep in mind

04:26.531 --> 04:28.399
there's only 60 amp
service there,

04:28.433 --> 04:29.968
so don't be pluggin' a lot
of gadgets in all at once,

04:30.002 --> 04:31.402
if you know what I mean.

04:31.436 --> 04:33.872
Yet another disturbing look
into his world.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.207
Roland: All right, directions.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.609
Super easy, Johnny.
Here's what I want you to do.

04:38.644 --> 04:41.879
Okay, I want you take highway 10
to Loon Lake Road north, okay?

04:41.913 --> 04:43.046
I want you to take
a right there.

04:43.081 --> 04:44.582
There's gonna be a split
in the fence,

04:44.616 --> 04:46.850
I want you to go left
at that split, and keep going.

04:46.885 --> 04:49.587
Go through the intersection
of Loon Lake Road south, okay?

04:49.621 --> 04:51.155
And then you're gonna find
Pine Road.

04:51.189 --> 04:52.823
Now you go up Pine Road,
I want you take a right

04:52.857 --> 04:54.158
at that big oak tree, all right?

04:54.192 --> 04:55.760
It's old, it's big,
you can't miss it.

04:55.794 --> 04:57.194
You go down the hill to the left

04:57.228 --> 04:58.128
and we're the third cabin
on the right, okay?

04:58.163 --> 04:59.396
The key's under the mat.

04:59.430 --> 05:02.332
- Johnny: Got it.
- Moira: Really?

05:02.366 --> 05:04.234
Johnny: Key is under the mat.

05:04.269 --> 05:07.404
So I think I'm gonna go
next door

05:07.438 --> 05:09.863
because your mess
is making me anxious.

05:09.883 --> 05:12.092
What mess?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.785
David: You know how clean my
apartment was in New York.

05:13.805 --> 05:15.815
It was so clean.
It was really clean.

05:15.835 --> 05:17.447
Well, it was very clean

05:17.481 --> 05:20.082
because you had a maid
to keep it very clean for you.

05:20.117 --> 05:23.219
No. I kept it clean
after Cecilia cleaned.

05:23.253 --> 05:28.224
Anyway, I think it's best if we
just take some space and um...

05:28.258 --> 05:30.159
I am looking forward
to sleeping in a bed

05:30.194 --> 05:34.197
that his not...
made for a toddler.

05:34.231 --> 05:38.140
Okay. I'll just chill here
in my own space and...

05:38.160 --> 05:40.203
David: Yeah.

05:40.237 --> 05:42.738
Alexis: Maybe I'll do a
mask or something and...

05:42.772 --> 05:45.101
check in with myself
and see how I'm doing...

05:45.121 --> 05:46.875
Okay, so we're good?

05:46.909 --> 05:50.312
- Alexis: Yeah.
- David: Okay. See you tomorrow.

05:50.347 --> 05:52.481
Okay. (Door closes)

05:56.085 --> 05:58.854
(Bedding rustles)

05:58.888 --> 06:02.090
(Relaxing sigh,
book pages rustle)

06:07.696 --> 06:09.898
(Door creaks shut)

06:10.484 --> 06:12.159
I'm out of mask.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.916
I was so bored in there!

06:16.936 --> 06:19.040
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:19.075 --> 06:22.172
Alexis: Okay, so I think that we should
take advantage of mom and dad being gone.

06:22.192 --> 06:22.984
David: I am.

06:23.004 --> 06:24.865
Alexis: Okay, but like
throwing a party or something.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.664
David: No. Absolutely not.

06:25.684 --> 06:27.948
Alexis: Just a tiny, little,
casual motel party.

06:27.983 --> 06:30.451
Okay, Alexis, I have no
interest in finding out

06:30.486 --> 06:34.321
what types of people are attracted
to "casual motel parties."

06:34.356 --> 06:36.523
Alexis: But you do have an
interest in lounging on a bed

06:36.557 --> 06:38.658
that mom and dad
have had sex all over?

06:38.693 --> 06:39.826
David: Why would you do
that to me right now?

06:39.861 --> 06:43.397
David, I just... I miss my life!
And I miss doing things.

06:43.431 --> 06:45.866
And I miss being surrounded
by loose acquaintances

06:45.901 --> 06:51.511
who think that I'm... funny,
and smart, and charming.

06:52.207 --> 06:54.841
Will you? Just a few people.
Please. You can't tell me

06:54.876 --> 06:56.242
that you don't wanna hang out
with people other than me.

06:56.277 --> 06:58.645
- David: Obviously.
- Alexis: Okay, so...?

06:58.679 --> 06:59.756
- David: Okay, fine. Something small.
- Alexis: Yes!

06:59.776 --> 07:01.314
David: Like a little games night.

07:01.348 --> 07:02.982
Yes, like a small,
little games night party.

07:03.017 --> 07:05.184
No. Like a little games night
period.

07:05.219 --> 07:07.020
Okay, fine. And then, if it
turns into something else,

07:07.054 --> 07:08.522
it turns into something else.

07:08.556 --> 07:10.023
Well, it won't 'cause there's
only six people invited.

07:10.057 --> 07:11.956
Any more and game play
gets too yelly.

07:11.976 --> 07:14.632
It gets very yelly.

07:15.662 --> 07:17.363
Okay, this party is gonna be...

07:17.398 --> 07:18.464
- David: It's not a party.
- Alexis: awesome!

07:18.498 --> 07:20.705
- David: It's not a party.
- Alexis: So. Much. Fun!

07:20.725 --> 07:22.430
I'm so excited!

07:24.949 --> 07:26.426
(Door bangs shut)

07:27.206 --> 07:30.075
(Insects chirp, birds Twitter)

07:30.109 --> 07:31.948
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

07:34.414 --> 07:37.316
(Engine cuts out,
doors creak open and bang shut)

07:39.953 --> 07:44.820
Johnny: Hey, not bad!
Rustic but nice, huh?

07:45.428 --> 07:47.351
The great outdoors, Moira.

07:47.371 --> 07:49.828
I am shocked and delighted.

07:49.862 --> 07:52.331
Yes. I have to say
I was nervous about this,

07:52.365 --> 07:57.302
but I've gotta hand it
to Roland, he came through.

07:57.655 --> 08:00.738
He's moron!
(Pots and dishes clatter)

08:00.773 --> 08:02.373
Key's under the mat, is it?

08:02.407 --> 08:04.108
The key is under the mat!
(Ripping sound)

08:04.142 --> 08:07.512
Agh! That's great!
Lying son-of-a...

08:07.546 --> 08:11.248
(pan crashes on floor)
Agh! Idiot man!

08:12.018 --> 08:13.512
Moron!

08:13.532 --> 08:16.420
Ha! Oh, good.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.771
- Moira: John?!
- Johnny: Yeah! Coming, honey!

08:19.056 --> 08:20.757
I'm coming.

08:21.452 --> 08:23.090
(Blows out his breath)

08:26.070 --> 08:27.870
(Lock clicks)

08:30.203 --> 08:32.903
Well hellooooo.

08:32.937 --> 08:37.573
Oh, my car broke down
and it's raining,

08:37.609 --> 08:41.211
and I wondered
if I might spend the night.

08:41.245 --> 08:44.481
Well, first let's get you
out of those... dry clothes

08:44.516 --> 08:48.184
and we'll see where
the night takes us.

08:48.219 --> 08:50.946
David: So I need to flesh
out this games night thing.

08:50.966 --> 08:52.489
Between you and my sister,

08:52.523 --> 08:55.125
and the barn guy and that girl
in the restaurant, we have 5,

08:55.159 --> 08:57.727
and obviously we need an even 6
for ultimate game play.

08:57.761 --> 09:00.463
Stevie: Well, what if
I'm not a games person?

09:00.498 --> 09:02.673
David: We're far too similar
for you not to be, so...

09:02.693 --> 09:04.678
Options, please.

09:05.301 --> 09:06.903
Obviously they need
to be funny, and smart,

09:06.937 --> 09:08.638
and have well-rounded
sense of humour

09:08.672 --> 09:10.239
and a wide range of knowledge.

09:10.273 --> 09:12.675
Oh, all those types of people
move away from here.

09:12.709 --> 09:15.645
- David: That's funny.
- Stevie: No, I'm serious.

09:15.679 --> 09:17.880
- Stevie: Ooh, what about Eric?
- David: Hmm?

09:17.915 --> 09:19.682
He finished high school.

09:19.716 --> 09:21.816
I don't love his look.

09:21.851 --> 09:24.953
Oh, looks are important? Oh...
Why don't we throw a pageant?

09:24.987 --> 09:28.190
Trust me, if I had time,
we would, but we don't, so...

09:28.224 --> 09:30.625
What about Sarah?
She's cute and speaks english.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.394
Hmm? Mm...

09:35.444 --> 09:36.398
She get it?

09:36.433 --> 09:39.500
- Stevie: Get what?
- Like "get it" get it. It, like the vibe.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.502
Understand that games night
needs to run a certain way,

09:42.522 --> 09:44.694
otherwise it won't work.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.400
Can I be on your team?
You sound really fun.

09:50.379 --> 09:51.713
David: Listen, you don't have to
help me out if you don't want to.

09:51.747 --> 09:53.493
- David: I can find someone else.
- Stevie: Really?

09:53.513 --> 09:55.649
- David: Mm-hmm.
- Stevie: Okay.

09:55.684 --> 09:58.553
- David: Well, it's-okay.
- Stevie: Have fun.

09:58.587 --> 10:01.355
- David: Okay.
- Stevie: My money's on the other team.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.403
(Receding footsteps,
cars rumble by)

10:05.000 --> 10:11.074

10:12.428 --> 10:14.999
(door opens)

10:16.366 --> 10:17.999
David: Hi. (Door clicks shut)

10:18.350 --> 10:20.301
Can I help you?

10:20.336 --> 10:23.472
Yeah, I just uh...
Came to apologize.

10:23.506 --> 10:25.440
For what?

10:25.475 --> 10:28.343
For uninviting you
to games night.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.845
You did not uninvite me.
I uninvited myself.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.248
Mm-hmm. Okay, well, um...

10:33.282 --> 10:35.329
I would really like it
if you came

10:35.349 --> 10:37.986
and I would really love it
if you could bring...

10:38.020 --> 10:41.720
one other person
of your choosing.

10:41.740 --> 10:45.693
So it doesn't matter
if they don't blend?

10:46.088 --> 10:47.602
M-mm-mm.

10:47.622 --> 10:50.163
And this doesn't have anything
to do with the fact

10:50.198 --> 10:52.566
that you couldn't find
anybody else to come?

10:52.601 --> 10:55.603
(Scoffs) No. What? No. I...

10:55.637 --> 10:58.773
You are a very bright,
funny person,

10:58.807 --> 11:01.574
with a wide range
of useful knowledge

11:01.609 --> 11:04.227
and the fact that
we don't have an ideal number

11:04.247 --> 11:08.215
for team style game-play,
is not... not why I'm here.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.555
You're such a liar.

11:10.575 --> 11:12.685
And I was bluffing
when I said I wasn't coming.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.355
I just wanted to see you beg,
so...

11:15.390 --> 11:16.956
- David: Okay.
- Stevie: I'll put out some feelers,

11:16.990 --> 11:18.458
but, you know,
such short notice,

11:18.492 --> 11:20.493
all the town hotties
will have plans.

11:20.528 --> 11:23.730
I'll see you tonight!
Yeah, thanks.

11:23.764 --> 11:25.745
- David: Thank you.
- Stevie: Welcome.

11:29.331 --> 11:34.706
Moira: This place is almost charming.
Very rustic cottage.

11:34.741 --> 11:37.076
I was half expecting
early unibomber.

11:37.110 --> 11:40.313
Johnny: Oh, look!
Roland and Jocelyn.

11:40.347 --> 11:41.860
Moira: Who are the other two?

11:41.880 --> 11:44.216
Johnny: Well, that's Bob.
He's on the town council.

11:44.251 --> 11:45.974
Moira: And his partner?

11:45.994 --> 11:48.720
Roland has gay friends!
Again, shocked and delighted.

11:48.755 --> 11:50.422
I think that's his wife.

11:50.457 --> 11:52.691
Moira: No, they're
both called husband.

11:52.725 --> 11:55.360
Look at the them smiling away.

11:55.394 --> 11:57.696
What have they got to be
so happy about?

11:57.730 --> 11:59.865
Johnny: Well, they have no money issues.
That's why they're so happy.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.879
Yeah, they just don't know
any better.

12:01.899 --> 12:04.302
(Birds sing, crickets chirp)

12:04.337 --> 12:07.119
David: So, Eric,

12:08.707 --> 12:10.808
how do you know Stevie?

12:10.843 --> 12:12.810
Eric:
She used to be my babysitter.

12:12.845 --> 12:14.745
Great. Wow. Okay.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.615
And how are your...
Trivia skills?

12:17.649 --> 12:19.184
- Eric: My what?
- David: Oh my God.

12:19.218 --> 12:21.652
Okay. Good choice. Good choice.

12:21.687 --> 12:23.654
(Knock at the door)

12:23.689 --> 12:25.389
Alexis: (Squeals excitedly)

12:25.423 --> 12:27.458
(Door opens)

12:27.493 --> 12:31.295
You guys came. Together.
That's so cute! Come in!

12:31.329 --> 12:33.731
Twyla, you look amazing!

12:33.765 --> 12:37.201
Mutt, you look like
a mill dollars.

12:37.235 --> 12:38.735
Twyla: Okay, so I brought
this pie from work

12:38.769 --> 12:40.637
but on the way, I realized
I didn't check what kind

12:40.671 --> 12:42.506
so there's a 50/50 chance
there's meat in it.

12:42.540 --> 12:43.840
Alexis: Oh my God, that's so cute.
Thank you.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.243
David: Okay, so it's 8:15.
It's 8:15.

12:46.277 --> 12:49.246
We should have started at 8.
So... fifteen minutes late,

12:49.280 --> 12:52.949
let's sit down and I will...
explain the game.

12:52.984 --> 12:55.652
Alexis: And I would just like to
thank everybody so much for coming.

12:55.686 --> 12:58.287
This is the first social thing
that I've done

12:58.322 --> 13:02.225
in like a really long time,
so let's just have so much fun

13:02.259 --> 13:03.887
and we'll just see
where the night takes us.

13:03.907 --> 13:06.496
David: Well, it'll take us to a three
part games night that ends at 10.

13:06.531 --> 13:08.064
Alexis: Okay, well, we'll see.

13:08.098 --> 13:09.699
- David: Okay, so let's start.
- Alexis: Okay.

13:09.734 --> 13:12.968
David: Let's start by putting
down 10 famous names

13:13.003 --> 13:15.527
onto the pieces of paper
in front of you.

13:15.547 --> 13:18.541
Mutt: I don't think I can fit ten
names on this piece of paper.

13:18.575 --> 13:21.444
David: That's funny. That's funny.
No. One per piece of paper.

13:21.478 --> 13:24.582
Ten pieces of paper, ten names.

13:24.602 --> 13:26.382
- Eric: Who should I put down?
- David: I can't tell you that, Eric,

13:26.417 --> 13:27.983
'cause that would wreck
the game.

13:28.018 --> 13:29.518
Eric: So then how do
I know what to put?

13:29.553 --> 13:31.020
- David: Oh my God.
- Stevie: (Whispers) Relax.

13:31.054 --> 13:32.621
Twyla:
Can you put yourself down?

13:32.656 --> 13:34.990
Alexis: Oh, okay, who wants a shot?
Because I do.

13:35.025 --> 13:38.293
David: No, we need to finish
putting the names down first.

13:38.327 --> 13:40.328
(Knock at the door)
David: Who's that?

13:40.363 --> 13:43.298
Alexis: Okay, I may or may not
have invited a few other people.

13:43.332 --> 13:45.567
- David: What kind-who?
- I don't know. I met them on the way home.

13:45.601 --> 13:48.537
(Running footsteps,
door clicks open)

13:48.571 --> 13:50.338
- Alexis: Hey!
- Dane: Hey.

13:50.373 --> 13:51.573
- Alexis: How are you?
- Dane: Good, good.

13:51.607 --> 13:53.241
- Alexis: Good. Hey!
- Dane: Hey, kids.

13:53.276 --> 13:55.643
Stevie... Mutt... Twyla.

13:55.678 --> 13:57.412
- Stevie: Hey, Dane.
- David: Who the... Bleep... is this?

13:57.447 --> 14:00.949
He's the worst, okay?
So just breathe through it.

14:00.983 --> 14:04.351
David: Hi. David Rose.
Oh... 'Kay.

14:04.386 --> 14:09.356
So we have split into teams and that's
an odd number, so we're... stuck.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.492
No worries. We're here for
the party. Keg's in the truck.

14:11.526 --> 14:12.794
What kegs? No one ordered a keg.

14:12.828 --> 14:15.429
David, can you please
not be rude in front of...

14:15.464 --> 14:17.364
- Dane: Dane.
- Alexis: Dane?

14:17.399 --> 14:18.665
- Eric: So now what?
- David: (Jumps) Oh, God!

14:18.700 --> 14:21.435
In the bowl, Eric.
Put them in the...

14:21.470 --> 14:22.570
(Papers rustle, pen clatters)

14:22.604 --> 14:24.338
(Crickets chirp)

14:26.928 --> 14:29.610
- Johnny: Wow.
- Moira: Yeah.

14:29.644 --> 14:32.313
I can't see out of one eye.

14:32.347 --> 14:34.447
But I'm still alive,
that's the main thing.

14:34.482 --> 14:37.951
(Sighs) I'm hungry.
Should I go get...

14:37.986 --> 14:42.623
No! No. You don't have to get anything.

14:42.657 --> 14:46.265
I will get some food,
I will get the wine.

14:47.695 --> 14:51.655
You... have done more
than enough.

14:51.675 --> 14:53.462
(Wine glasses clink)

14:58.533 --> 15:00.933
Bob: Oh good, you're done.

15:00.953 --> 15:04.511
We uh... we didn't wanna
interrupt.

15:04.785 --> 15:06.479
Johnny: What're doing here?

15:06.514 --> 15:09.715
Bob: Oh, just finishing off the
latest Harold Zable novel.

15:09.750 --> 15:13.241
- (Chuckles) You ever read him?
- How long have you been here?

15:13.261 --> 15:15.554
Quite a while.

15:15.588 --> 15:18.702
Yeah, you seemed to have a little
trouble there, getting going.

15:18.722 --> 15:20.626
And, uh, well, we uh...

15:20.661 --> 15:24.038
We didn't think you needed
the extra pressure on you, so...

15:24.058 --> 15:26.231
Gwen: Oh, hi! You're good.

15:26.266 --> 15:27.832
Moira: And you are?

15:27.867 --> 15:30.302
Bob: I'm Bob, this
is my wife Gwen,

15:30.336 --> 15:33.938
and, uh, this is our cabin.

15:33.973 --> 15:37.142
Johnny: Oh, no, no, no. This
is Roland and Jocelyn's cabin.

15:37.177 --> 15:39.278
Gwen: No, they're a
mile up the road.

15:39.312 --> 15:43.014
Bob: Big tree, a fence.
You can't miss it.

15:43.049 --> 15:45.884
(Awkward silence, Johnny sighs)

15:45.918 --> 15:47.451
David:
She died! She's a dead person!

15:47.486 --> 15:49.520
- Twyla: Marilyn Monroe!
- David: No! She helps people!

15:49.555 --> 15:51.422
- Twyla: Oprah.
- Stevie: Calcutta! Calcutta!

15:51.456 --> 15:53.124
- David: Calcutta! The lepers!
- She's the mother... She's a mother...

15:53.159 --> 15:54.592
David:
It's not your turn, Alexis!

15:54.626 --> 15:55.827
- Twyla: Princess Diana.
- Stevie and David: No! She's...

15:55.861 --> 15:57.562
David: The lepers in
Calcutta, she helps them.

15:57.596 --> 15:58.804
- Stevie: Lepers! Lepers!
- David: There's all these lepers.

15:58.824 --> 15:59.763
Alexis:
Stop yelling at her though!

15:59.798 --> 16:01.199
David: It's the point of
the game is the yell!

16:01.233 --> 16:03.301
She's a mother
and has your cousin's name.

16:03.335 --> 16:05.269
Twyla: Teresa?

16:05.304 --> 16:06.937
- Twyla: Mother Teresa!
- Alexis: Yes!

16:06.971 --> 16:09.207
David: You can't say mother!
You can't say mother!

16:09.241 --> 16:11.609
- Mutt: She wasn't getting it.
- David: That's the point!

16:11.643 --> 16:13.744
Anyway, no points for them.
We have to start this again.

16:13.778 --> 16:15.913
- Dane: This party's terrible.
- David: Excuse me?

16:15.947 --> 16:17.915
Alexis: Okay, so then, hey, why
don't we do something else,

16:17.949 --> 16:19.349
like a drinking game.

16:19.383 --> 16:21.418
David: No! Absolutely not!

16:21.452 --> 16:24.221
Every time the vein in my brother's
eye twitches, we take a drink.

16:24.255 --> 16:26.085
David: Why would you bring up my
eye in front of all these people?

16:26.105 --> 16:27.290
(Knock at the door)

16:27.325 --> 16:29.559
- David: Who is that?!
- Alexis: Calm down.

16:29.594 --> 16:31.261
Dane thought he should just invite
over a few more of his friends, so...

16:31.295 --> 16:32.362
- David: Oh, did he?
- Alexis: Yeah.

16:32.396 --> 16:33.763
Dane: Who's up for strip poker?

16:33.797 --> 16:35.632
David: Okay, you know what?
I'm out. No, that's it.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.664
I'm gonna call it a night.
I'm gonna pack it in.

16:37.684 --> 16:39.369
Eric, don't look at my eye!

16:39.403 --> 16:40.803
Alexis: Why are you being
such an old woman?

16:40.838 --> 16:43.039
I'm sorry that I wanted
to have fun tonight

16:43.073 --> 16:44.974
and invite a few random guys over and
try and make out with them, okay?

16:45.008 --> 16:47.343
You're not the only one
dying in this town.

16:47.377 --> 16:50.446
It is boring and I am just
trying to make the best of it.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.716
I'm really sorry everybody.
No offense, okay?

16:53.751 --> 16:55.517
Twyla: I'm well-versed
in family conflict...

16:55.552 --> 16:57.120
David: I'm sure you are. Alexis?

16:57.154 --> 16:59.588
If you want to party,
have a party.

16:59.623 --> 17:02.824
But I have a queen bed
next door with my name on it

17:02.859 --> 17:06.595
and I have been looking forward to
sleeping in that bed all day, so...

17:06.630 --> 17:08.297
Mutt: Maybe we should go.

17:08.330 --> 17:11.433
Alexis: No. You know what, guys?
It's totally fine.

17:11.468 --> 17:14.603
David, I would love it if you
would come and party with us,

17:14.637 --> 17:16.972
but it's totally up to you.

17:17.006 --> 17:19.741
David: And I'm totally gonna go.
So everybody have a good night.

17:19.776 --> 17:21.409
I don't know who you are!

17:21.443 --> 17:23.411
Dane, put that down
and get off my bed!

17:23.444 --> 17:26.826
No one on my bed tonight.
And don't-no one throw up!

17:26.984 --> 17:28.282
(Door slams shut)

17:28.317 --> 17:31.219
So his eye twitched five times,
so drink up, bitches!

17:31.254 --> 17:33.255
- Guys: All right!
- Alexis: Woo!

17:33.289 --> 17:35.723
Dane: Shots! All right.
Ready and...

17:35.758 --> 17:38.359
Johnny:
And once again, my apologies.

17:38.394 --> 17:40.495
Moira: And I'm sorry, I don't
know how to make a bed.

17:40.529 --> 17:43.464
Johnny: And I may have
damaged your corkscrew, Bob.

17:43.499 --> 17:45.633
Bob: You broke it in half.

17:45.668 --> 17:47.502
(Door rattles
as Johnny struggles)

17:47.536 --> 17:50.271
Johnny: Okay, the door, it won't open.
The door won't open.

17:50.306 --> 17:51.572
- Bob: It's locked.
- Johnny: Oh, it's locked.

17:51.607 --> 17:53.440
Moira: What do you want from us?

17:53.474 --> 17:56.567
Bob: Yes, it's... it's
locked to prevent strangers

17:56.587 --> 17:59.046
from coming into the cabin.

17:59.080 --> 18:03.462
See, uh, we didn't realize
that, uh, strangers

18:03.899 --> 18:07.221
would already be in the cabin
when we locked it.

18:07.919 --> 18:09.802
Johnny: I see. Oh. Okay.

18:09.921 --> 18:11.043
Moira: Bye!

18:11.063 --> 18:13.026
- Johnny: There we go.
- Moira: Thank you. Bye.

18:13.060 --> 18:17.750
Johnny: You've been consummate
hosts, really. Fantastic day.

18:20.818 --> 18:22.029
(Door bangs shut)

18:22.546 --> 18:24.722
(Music plays)

18:25.105 --> 18:26.572
Twyla: Hey, Mutt, can you
pass me a drink? Um...

18:26.606 --> 18:27.939
(Door bangs shut,
muted chatter through door)

18:27.959 --> 18:30.676
- Stevie: Sorry. Hey!
- David: Hi!

18:31.572 --> 18:33.239
Here's the thing.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.866
Um, I'm sorry that you and
your sister are in a domestic,

18:37.886 --> 18:40.086
and I'm sorry that
I invited Eric.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.363
That joke was funnier in theory.

18:42.383 --> 18:43.783
Bad joke.

18:43.803 --> 18:45.858
But I'm gonna need you
to come back in there.

18:45.878 --> 18:46.959
David: Why?

18:47.258 --> 18:50.429
Because I don't really
like most of those people

18:50.464 --> 18:52.832
and, believe it or not,
we are in the middle

18:52.866 --> 18:56.266
of a very intense game
of drunken charades

18:56.286 --> 19:00.605
and my team is losing. Badly.

19:01.161 --> 19:03.425
Well, that's not really
my thing.

19:03.445 --> 19:04.983
It's not my thing either,

19:05.003 --> 19:06.745
but you were right;
We're way too similar

19:06.779 --> 19:10.349
and I am having
a very hard time losing, so...

19:10.383 --> 19:13.759
I will happily let you
get back to this big queen bed

19:13.779 --> 19:15.920
if you'll just help us win
a few more rounds.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.822
Just need somebody sober.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.957
- David: I can't...
- Stevie: Please.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.250
Go back in there.
It's embarrassing.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.529
They are way too drunk
to remember.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.730
(Sighs)

19:26.765 --> 19:29.633
Just two winning rounds
and then it's over.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.751
Then you can go back
to your book.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.705
- David: Fine. Fine. Two rounds.
- Stevie: You can go back to sleep.

19:34.739 --> 19:36.206
- David: Quick. Quick rounds.
- Stevie: Thank you.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.791
- David: Fine.
- Stevie: Thank you.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.411
Stevie: And just don't look
at the stain on your bed,

19:40.445 --> 19:41.978
and we'll mime
something special.

19:42.013 --> 19:44.548
- David: What stain?
- Stevie: Uh...

19:44.582 --> 19:46.049
David: You're lucky I'm
good at this game.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.128
- Dane: Yes! A mexican...
- Alexis: Just get this one!

19:53.466 --> 19:56.215
Moira: Are you sure you don't want to
call a tradesman or someone, John?

19:56.235 --> 19:58.904
Moira, I don't need a tradesman.

19:58.938 --> 20:01.539
I can handle a screwdriver,
okay?

20:01.574 --> 20:05.363
This is working out just...
fine.

20:05.859 --> 20:08.979
(Grunts of effort)
And... that... is... in.

20:09.014 --> 20:12.198
Look at this.
(Opens and closes door)

20:12.590 --> 20:14.538
Instant lock.

20:15.053 --> 20:17.622
Moira:
Yes, let me tell you, Eddie.

20:17.656 --> 20:21.553
You look awfully good
in that blue collar.

20:22.459 --> 20:25.395
Johnny: (Voice-breaking twang) Well,
thank you very much, Mrs. Rose.

20:25.430 --> 20:28.432
I don't often get compliments
when I'm fixing doors.

20:28.466 --> 20:31.836
Oh, Edward,
I'm afraid I must tell you,

20:31.870 --> 20:34.851
I shan't be able to pay
you today.

20:34.871 --> 20:37.928
(Voice-breaking twang)
Well, that's okay, Mrs. Rose.

20:37.948 --> 20:42.979
Maybe there's um...
some other way you can pay me,

20:43.013 --> 20:45.181
if you get my drift.

20:45.216 --> 20:47.484
(Door rips open,
lock jingles uselessly)

20:47.518 --> 20:49.752
Did you take my mask?

20:53.797 --> 20:55.770
Thank you.

20:57.061 --> 20:58.848
(Door bangs shut)

21:01.156 --> 21:05.049
(Voice-breaking twang) Well, maybe
I'll use a bigger screw, Mrs. Rose.

21:05.069 --> 21:06.970
Don't you go anywheres.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.660
Moira:
I'll be right here, Eddie.
