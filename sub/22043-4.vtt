WEBVTT

00:02.389 --> 00:05.980
- [Gordon] I travelled to
Harpers Ferry, West Virginia,

00:05.980 --> 00:10.006
a small beautiful town
outside of Washington, DC.

00:10.006 --> 00:12.430
That is where I met Karan Townsend.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.631
- Good morning, welcome.

00:13.631 --> 00:14.825
- Nice to see you.
- I'm Karan Townsend.

00:14.825 --> 00:16.625
- [Gordon] Karan, good to see you.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.547
A woman who has a wacky
way of running a hotel,

00:19.547 --> 00:21.803
which is also her home.

00:21.803 --> 00:25.493
Let me tell you, I never
expected to see the things I saw.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.079
Oh shit.

00:27.079 --> 00:28.064
Wow, bit dusty.

00:28.064 --> 00:29.546
Do you sell these?
- We do.

00:29.546 --> 00:30.746
- [Gordon] A convenience store

00:30.746 --> 00:33.248
complete with hideous
dolls in the dining room.

00:33.248 --> 00:34.200
What is that?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.011
- [Karan] These are my famous baskets.

00:36.011 --> 00:37.388
- [Gordon] There were baskets everywhere,

00:37.388 --> 00:41.575
including ones with bugs in
them that were even up for sale.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.968
- [Karan] That's private.

00:42.968 --> 00:45.969
- I found her clothes locked
up in a wardrobe in my room.

00:45.969 --> 00:48.135
It's like garments from the Civil War.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.005
The thing with Karan is the
person she trusts the most

00:51.005 --> 00:53.808
spends her time painting
murals over destroyed walls

00:53.808 --> 00:57.157
and disturbing customers, and
she's not even an employee.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.987
- Didn't you have purple glasses earlier?

00:58.987 --> 01:00.623
- Leave them alone!
- Okay.

01:00.623 --> 01:02.172
- [Gordon] What is she
doing to your hotel?

01:02.172 --> 01:03.127
- It didn't go outside,

01:03.127 --> 01:05.087
I mean, it's not a hole to the outside.

01:05.087 --> 01:07.195
- You can't just Band-Aid this place.

01:07.195 --> 01:10.091
Karan was so confused to why
any of this was a problem,

01:10.091 --> 01:11.262
including the food.

01:11.262 --> 01:13.445
That's a disaster, disaster trout.

01:13.445 --> 01:14.501
Which was dreadful.

01:14.501 --> 01:15.711
It looks like a soup.

01:15.711 --> 01:18.641
- It was in the fridge and
then they microwaved it,

01:18.641 --> 01:20.146
from the fridge to the microwave.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.764
- [Gordon] Everything was frozen.

01:21.764 --> 01:23.369
You're just hoarding stuff, Karan.

01:23.369 --> 01:24.774
- [Karan] This is how much we need,

01:24.774 --> 01:25.938
we keep running out of stuff.

01:25.938 --> 01:27.938
- [Gordon] And the kitchen
was a disaster area.

01:27.938 --> 01:29.730
Are these TV screens, what are those?

01:29.730 --> 01:31.580
Microwaves?
- Microwaves.

01:31.580 --> 01:32.426
- [Gordon] Oh my God.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.892
Everywhere I turn there's
just junk everywhere.

01:34.892 --> 01:36.966
No organisation whatsoever.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.454
You're boiling a burger,

01:38.454 --> 01:39.763
why aren't you cooking it from fresh?

01:39.763 --> 01:41.361
- We make them ahead of time.

01:41.361 --> 01:43.051
- After learning the burgers were boiled,

01:43.051 --> 01:45.546
I honestly thought it
couldn't get any worse.

01:45.546 --> 01:48.347
That's a rotisserie chicken,
you get it from the freezer?

01:48.347 --> 01:49.264
Disgusting.

01:49.264 --> 01:51.255
But then I saw the frozen
store-bought chicken

01:51.255 --> 01:52.999
that was being microwaved.

01:52.999 --> 01:56.671
That is the worst thing
I've seen so far, I'm done.

01:56.671 --> 01:58.820
And I had to stop the madness.

01:58.820 --> 02:01.950
I'm so sorry, but you, as
customers, deserve better.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.508
You're not gonna act
responsible for it, I will,

02:04.508 --> 02:06.593
we're shutting it down.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.721
As my journey continues at the Town's Inn,

02:10.721 --> 02:13.035
the staff has finally had enough.

02:13.035 --> 02:14.658
- Gordon, this is the worst restaurant

02:14.658 --> 02:16.293
I ever worked in, in my life.

02:16.293 --> 02:17.954
- I need Karan to start opening her eyes

02:17.954 --> 02:20.593
because my time is
running out to help her.

02:20.593 --> 02:22.373
You don't even think there's a problem,

02:22.373 --> 02:23.937
that's what worries me.

02:23.937 --> 02:25.807
The practises are so bad!

02:25.807 --> 02:27.236
- I'm just so fucking fed up!

02:27.236 --> 02:29.089
- You have to take responsibility.

02:29.089 --> 02:30.075
- I'll do what I can do.

02:30.075 --> 02:32.807
- [Jeff] Look at this shit, look at this!

02:38.253 --> 02:40.753
(tense music)

02:44.791 --> 02:48.008
- You're gonna tell me that
this is a good chicken?

02:48.008 --> 02:49.479
- [Karan] I've eaten
it, like I said, yeah.

02:49.479 --> 02:50.635
- [Gordon] This is crazy.

02:50.635 --> 02:53.693
- You cannot go to the store
and buy stuff and resell it,

02:53.693 --> 02:54.526
you cannot.

02:54.526 --> 02:56.624
- Aren't you aware of what you're doing?

02:56.624 --> 02:58.200
Do you actually care?

02:59.267 --> 03:01.980
- Yes, I do.
- You do care?

03:01.980 --> 03:04.704
Which part of this hotel do you care?

03:04.704 --> 03:05.889
- Every part.

03:05.889 --> 03:08.587
- This is how delusional you are,

03:08.587 --> 03:10.647
that this is a good chicken.

03:10.647 --> 03:12.689
What's in this one here?

03:12.689 --> 03:15.070
- [Jill] Stuff that we.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.275
- Microwave?
- Pre-cook, yes, yes.

03:16.275 --> 03:19.171
- What's that?
- Eggplant.

03:19.171 --> 03:21.804
- [Gordon] So everything's
just reheated in the microwave?

03:21.804 --> 03:22.637
- Yes.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.610
- [Gordon] We're in
danger of being shut down

03:24.610 --> 03:25.910
by the health authorities.

03:28.917 --> 03:33.870
- I'm sorry, folks, basically
I take responsibility.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.516
I'm sorry, I'm very ashamed.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.516
(atmospheric music)

03:47.485 --> 03:50.484
I am fed up not being heard.

03:50.484 --> 03:52.487
It doesn't matter what I say,

03:52.487 --> 03:54.943
Karan is gonna do what she wanna to do.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.291
- [Gordon] What's going on?

04:03.291 --> 04:06.723
- Gordon, I'm just, I
don't have no help, man.

04:06.723 --> 04:09.613
I told her, she won't listen.

04:11.701 --> 04:13.232
- [Gordon] You can't perform like this.

04:13.232 --> 04:14.998
- I can't, I can't.

04:14.998 --> 04:19.136
- You can't, you're gonna
get fucking arrested.

04:19.136 --> 04:20.144
- I will get arrested,

04:20.144 --> 04:23.320
put in jail for killing some-damn-body.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.172
Gordon, this is the worst restaurant

04:25.172 --> 04:26.842
I ever worked in, in my life.

04:26.842 --> 04:28.280
- [Gordon] The practises are the problem.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.540
- Right.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.107
- The way that everyone's
walking around in denial.

04:32.107 --> 04:33.220
- They are, but I'm not!

04:33.220 --> 04:35.198
- But there's no standards though,

04:35.198 --> 04:38.142
you're not maintaining a
level that they deserve.

04:38.142 --> 04:39.900
- Yeah, I know that, I know that, chef.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.933
- So why have you become like a zombie

04:41.933 --> 04:43.063
and following her motions?

04:43.063 --> 04:44.943
- I'm not, I'm trying to fix it.

04:44.943 --> 04:46.260
- [Gordon] Have you given up?

04:46.260 --> 04:48.984
- No, I have not given
up, I have not given up.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.267
- You're just as bad as she is

04:50.267 --> 04:52.500
if you don't put your
foot down and say no.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.158
- I tell her no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

04:56.158 --> 04:58.414
and she keeps on doing it.

04:58.414 --> 05:00.287
- [Gordon] Someone needs to draw a line.

05:00.287 --> 05:05.287
- I have drawn a line, it doesn't matter.

05:05.429 --> 05:09.520
I can only do so much
Gordon, this is not my place.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.819
- My apologies, ladies and
gentlemen, I'm so sorry.

05:12.819 --> 05:13.963
What a joke.

05:15.143 --> 05:18.420
Have you seen any of
this stuff going on here?

05:18.420 --> 05:20.763
Do you have any idea what's going on?

05:20.763 --> 05:21.732
What's this?

05:21.732 --> 05:23.017
- [Jill] Pre-cooked bacon.

05:23.017 --> 05:24.750
- [Gordon] Pre-cooked from when?

05:24.750 --> 05:28.038
- It's dated, they do that
every day just about, right?

05:28.038 --> 05:29.119
- [Gordon] No they don't.

05:29.119 --> 05:31.361
When was that cooked?

05:31.361 --> 05:32.930
That's not today.

05:32.930 --> 05:36.605
- Honestly, let's see what it says, 10/31.

05:36.605 --> 05:39.495
- We're in November the sixth now.

05:39.495 --> 05:41.231
This is insane.

05:41.231 --> 05:44.052
Look at that in there,
don't you drain that

05:44.052 --> 05:47.363
or it just sits there in its blood?

05:48.709 --> 05:49.878
And in here?

05:49.878 --> 05:51.723
- [Jill] That's a freezer.

05:53.011 --> 05:56.013
- [Gordon] Bloody hell, what is that?

05:57.442 --> 05:59.346
What's that noise?

05:59.346 --> 06:01.190
- [Jill] That's the fan.

06:02.966 --> 06:04.633
- What a nightmare.

06:06.754 --> 06:10.013
Karan, you got no idea that
this is going on like this?

06:12.484 --> 06:15.003
What is that in there, dish water?

06:15.003 --> 06:16.909
- [Jeff] No, there's
French fries in there.

06:16.909 --> 06:20.677
- [Gordon] Fries, why
is the water so dirty?

06:20.677 --> 06:22.632
- Nobody didn't change it.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.202
- Sorry?
- Nobody didn't change it,

06:24.202 --> 06:25.054
sir.

06:25.054 --> 06:26.999
- [Gordon] But you're cooking
fries from there tonight

06:26.999 --> 06:31.483
in that water, I saw them
fill up the fryer twice.

06:31.483 --> 06:33.719
- It sucks.

06:33.719 --> 06:35.745
- [Gordon] Where'd you get the ham from?

06:35.745 --> 06:38.373
- [Jeff] She bought it at the store.

06:38.373 --> 06:39.619
- [Gordon] Holy crap.

06:39.619 --> 06:40.586
- It's a spiral cut,

06:40.586 --> 06:42.458
they cut it and put it in here

06:42.458 --> 06:47.458
and then use it for side
of ham for breakfast.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.141
- [Gordon] When was the
last time this was cleaned?

06:50.141 --> 06:53.218
- Last year when I cleaned this, chef.

06:53.218 --> 06:55.137
- Last year when you cleaned the oven?

06:55.137 --> 06:56.713
We're in November.

06:58.464 --> 07:00.983
Last year?
- Yes, sir.

07:02.346 --> 07:04.725
I asked Karan, I said,
"Karan, we need to shut down,

07:04.725 --> 07:07.307
we gotta do maintenance."

07:09.567 --> 07:14.163
- Look at the mess, why have
you let it go like this?

07:15.496 --> 07:18.041
- I didn't know that
they were doing things

07:18.041 --> 07:19.500
that were not that proper.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.939
- Karan, you.

07:20.939 --> 07:22.510
- No, but listen to me, Jeff.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.063
- Just stop bullshitting the guy, okay?

07:25.063 --> 07:27.241
Let's tell him the truth here, okay?

07:27.241 --> 07:29.675
I asked for some new equipment,

07:29.675 --> 07:32.198
I can't get no new equipment, why not?

07:32.198 --> 07:33.215
I've been here for four years,

07:33.215 --> 07:35.095
I've been asking for new equipment.

07:35.095 --> 07:39.245
I can't work with this shit
here, look, look at that!

07:39.245 --> 07:41.352
I'm fucking pissed.

07:41.352 --> 07:42.713
I've been asking for it,

07:42.713 --> 07:43.903
I've been asking for new equipment,

07:43.903 --> 07:45.313
how long do you think
this shit's gonna last?

07:45.313 --> 07:48.297
It ain't gonna last forever.

07:48.297 --> 07:50.322
I'm just so fucking fed up

07:50.322 --> 07:52.247
with every damn thing.

07:52.247 --> 07:56.033
I can't get no help, me and
Jill pulled you out of this

07:56.033 --> 07:58.785
and now I ask for some
help with some equipment

07:58.785 --> 08:02.640
and you can't spend on it!

08:02.640 --> 08:04.967
- This is working and that's working.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.804
- Look at this shit, look at this!

08:07.804 --> 08:10.554
(dramatic music)

08:15.249 --> 08:17.433
Tired of the damn lying.

08:21.987 --> 08:25.640
I'm just so fucking fed
up with every damn thing,

08:25.640 --> 08:27.930
look at this shit, look at this!

08:32.599 --> 08:35.582
Tired of the damn lying.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.571
- You can't expect to work in this,

08:38.571 --> 08:40.480
are you greedy with the money?

08:40.480 --> 08:43.607
- I'm in debt, I'm barely breaking even.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.846
- [Jeff] Let's get real.

08:45.846 --> 08:47.217
- They're at their wits end,

08:47.217 --> 08:50.909
they're done, they're finished,
and they're a spent force.

08:50.909 --> 08:52.624
- I've been cooking for 20 years

08:52.624 --> 08:54.985
and I've never had this problem.

08:54.985 --> 08:56.918
We have to step up.

08:56.918 --> 09:00.687
- I mean, look at the
kitchen, it's atrocious!

09:00.687 --> 09:03.053
Look at this here, would you work in this?

09:03.053 --> 09:04.332
- I do.

09:04.332 --> 09:05.880
- It's all funny with you.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.010
- No, it's not funny.
- I do, I laugh.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.577
Look at the mess.

09:09.577 --> 09:10.696
- I can't do it all.

09:10.696 --> 09:12.521
- You own this place.

09:12.521 --> 09:14.783
- But I delegated the restaurant to them.

09:14.783 --> 09:16.340
- Karan, the bottom line is

09:16.340 --> 09:18.976
you have no idea how to run a restaurant

09:18.976 --> 09:19.924
and all you're doing now

09:19.924 --> 09:22.070
is blaming the staff you put in there.

09:22.070 --> 09:23.498
But they're taking the heat

09:23.498 --> 09:26.122
and your problems aren't their problems,

09:26.122 --> 09:27.742
but they've become their problems

09:27.742 --> 09:30.333
because look at the mess.

09:31.729 --> 09:33.128
You don't even think there's a problem,

09:33.128 --> 09:34.883
that's what worries me.

09:34.883 --> 09:37.837
Practises are so bad, that's
what I'm trying to say.

09:37.837 --> 09:39.800
Why has it got this bad?

09:39.800 --> 09:42.570
You have to take responsibility.

09:42.570 --> 09:45.609
You're ignorant,
oblivious, and delusional.

09:45.609 --> 09:47.860
- I'll do what I can do.

09:48.737 --> 09:50.345
- It's not good enough.

09:50.345 --> 09:55.345
I'm going to my room, I've
seen enough shit for one night.

09:55.510 --> 09:57.483
Oh man, fucking hell.

09:58.611 --> 10:01.328
- [Jill] Thank God somebody
else sees it other than us,

10:01.328 --> 10:03.275
this is what we deal with on every day,

10:03.275 --> 10:05.096
it's nothing different.
- I lost my damn hat.

10:05.096 --> 10:06.081
- [Jill] It's in there, I'll find it,

10:06.081 --> 10:07.094
I know where you threw it.

10:07.094 --> 10:10.505
- We could have done this without Ramsay.

10:10.505 --> 10:11.338
- No, no.

10:13.541 --> 10:15.846
- What do I spend on myself?

10:15.846 --> 10:17.299
I'm doing the best I can.

10:17.299 --> 10:20.415
I borrowed money and went out
and bought more refrigerators

10:20.415 --> 10:22.182
then, oh, we need freezers.

10:22.182 --> 10:26.899
- I know Karan, why didn't
we just tone down the menu?

10:26.899 --> 10:29.395
- The menu is what you all do,

10:29.395 --> 10:30.719
you could have told me

10:30.719 --> 10:32.350
that these are the things we need to do.

10:32.350 --> 10:33.505
- I did tell you.
- And this is why.

10:33.505 --> 10:36.196
I will tell you, Jeff, I
have no stake in that menu,

10:36.196 --> 10:38.112
I thought that's what you and Jill wanted.

10:38.112 --> 10:39.471
- No, that's not it.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.275
- We just have to agree to disagree then.

10:41.275 --> 10:44.189
- And you get your way.
- Jeff, you work hard,

10:44.189 --> 10:45.110
I agree,

10:45.110 --> 10:48.586
but over the year you have
averaged 44 hours a week

10:48.586 --> 10:49.517
and you're paid for a manager.
- No, I'm not talking

10:49.517 --> 10:51.050
about that.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.140
- That's not many hours.

10:52.140 --> 10:55.150
- [Jeff] No, Karan, I'm
not talking about that.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.292
- I'm listening, Jeff.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.443
- [Jeff] You're not hearing me, Karan.

11:04.811 --> 11:06.080
- What a mess,

11:06.080 --> 11:08.815
I mean, one of the worst
states of a kitchen hotel in

11:08.815 --> 11:10.771
I've ever seen in my entire career,

11:10.771 --> 11:13.062
also a owner that is delusional

11:13.062 --> 11:15.906
and she's convinced herself
that the place is run properly.

11:15.906 --> 11:19.392
I'm really uneasy about
just being in here,

11:19.392 --> 11:22.720
the smell is appalling,
everything feels dirty

11:22.720 --> 11:24.320
and I'm not convinced

11:24.320 --> 11:27.670
that even the bathrooms are that clean.

11:27.670 --> 11:32.670
I'll run a quick test,
quick bacteria test.

11:33.118 --> 11:36.518
There's a communal bathroom
that I am uncertain about.

11:36.518 --> 11:38.056
When this thing reads 30,

11:38.056 --> 11:43.056
it indicates that it's a
decent level of hygiene,

11:44.613 --> 11:45.616
basically it's clean,

11:45.616 --> 11:49.023
anything over 30 then it
gets into the danger zone.

11:50.517 --> 11:53.900
This is where the smell
is really bad in here,

11:53.900 --> 11:56.578
there's crap everywhere,
it's just so unhygienic.

11:56.578 --> 11:59.578
(atmospheric music)

12:01.200 --> 12:04.474
Doesn't feel clean.

12:04.474 --> 12:09.360
To get a good reading, rub
the swab underneath the mat.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.393
The smell under here is appalling.

12:12.393 --> 12:15.233
In these crevices, there's dirt.

12:17.137 --> 12:22.137
That's gross, that's gross.

12:24.623 --> 12:25.943
It's disgusting.

12:29.727 --> 12:33.533
Snap it, let the liquid go
down, give that a shake.

12:37.671 --> 12:41.510
Then, holy crap, no, no.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.571
I'm unconvinced that this place is clean.

12:47.571 --> 12:49.010
Everything smells,

12:49.010 --> 12:50.195
it's very difficult for
you to identify the smell

12:50.195 --> 12:52.703
but in here it really stinks.

12:55.229 --> 12:58.250
It's just the smell from here,
there's stains everywhere,

12:58.250 --> 13:00.957
and what scares me is
the fact that the kitchen

13:00.957 --> 13:03.610
took a year to get cleaned.

13:03.610 --> 13:08.067
God knows what this took, so pretty gross.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.440
Now, pop that in there.

13:12.454 --> 13:15.633
I'm unsure when this place
was cleaned properly.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.433
In.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.204
Oh my God.

13:23.204 --> 13:27.227
Karan, is Karan in here?

13:27.227 --> 13:30.156
Karan, just come upstairs,
please, two seconds,

13:30.156 --> 13:32.053
please, let's go, quick.

13:34.734 --> 13:36.093
Come in.

13:36.996 --> 13:41.234
I've just done a swab
test with the carpet.

13:41.234 --> 13:43.031
I told you, the smell is gross.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.521
Anything above 30,

13:44.521 --> 13:47.948
you're in the danger zone
for unhygienic practises

13:47.948 --> 13:51.115
and it's not fit for customers.

13:51.115 --> 13:52.734
What do you think the reading is?

13:52.734 --> 13:54.405
- 100?
- 100.

13:54.405 --> 13:56.231
- 50?
- 50.

13:56.231 --> 13:57.978
- 60.
- 70.

13:57.978 --> 14:02.775
- 70, 803.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.240
- 803?

14:04.240 --> 14:08.165
Oh my God, oops.

14:08.165 --> 14:10.839
- 803, oops?

14:10.839 --> 14:12.023
- Burn it down.
- That's not oops,

14:12.023 --> 14:15.247
that's oh no.
- 803.

14:15.247 --> 14:16.105
- Wow.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.527
- This is just the carpet,
you can't be that bad.

14:19.527 --> 14:22.437
- We get a lot of bikers,
bicyclists, and hikers.

14:22.437 --> 14:24.556
- Karan, you're paying $130

14:24.556 --> 14:29.556
to get out of bed and step on
a disgusting, stinking carpet.

14:32.050 --> 14:34.464
It smells like there's
crap all over the floor.

14:34.464 --> 14:36.768
- Probably 'cause there's
crap on the floor.

14:36.768 --> 14:38.300
- Probably, could be.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.757
- What does that mean, could be?

14:40.757 --> 14:44.761
- My first shift here,
you were in the bathroom

14:44.761 --> 14:48.483
and I think you had an accident
on the floor, on the mat.

14:52.445 --> 14:54.095
- Oh my God.

14:54.095 --> 14:56.502
- There have been times
when I have had diarrhoea

14:56.502 --> 14:57.860
but it doesn't happen very often,

14:57.860 --> 15:02.860
but no, I didn't realise
that there was a problem.

15:05.056 --> 15:06.640
- Fucking hell,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.454
all day both of you have been in denial,

15:09.454 --> 15:11.266
not one of you told me about the problems,

15:11.266 --> 15:14.203
not one of you have you taken
any form of responsibility.

15:14.203 --> 15:16.915
You were happy to serve
that food to me, lunchtime,

15:16.915 --> 15:18.780
you were happy to mosey around

15:18.780 --> 15:21.887
and piss around on the walls
and paint silly pictures.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.828
This is a travesty, this is shocking.

15:24.828 --> 15:29.179
Your staff knows it, but
you two are oblivious.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.733
- But the rest of the room
is dusted and cleaned.

15:32.733 --> 15:33.887
- What?

15:33.887 --> 15:35.678
- He's not talking about the room,

15:35.678 --> 15:37.430
it's not about the rug,
it's not about the food,

15:37.430 --> 15:40.005
it's about the whole picture.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.200
- [Sarah] Gauge, you're yelling.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.768
- Am I not allowed to yell, Sarah?

15:42.768 --> 15:45.105
Because someone has
to, because you're not.

15:45.105 --> 15:47.609
He's trying to here to help
us stop being in denial,

15:47.609 --> 15:50.757
it's not about the rug and
this perfectly dusted thing,

15:50.757 --> 15:52.642
this is not gonna make a difference,

15:52.642 --> 15:55.384
the whole picture, the whole thing.

15:55.384 --> 15:58.270
- What are you scared of Karan, admitting?

15:58.270 --> 16:00.819
- Well, I'm working 16
hours a day and spending

16:00.819 --> 16:01.767
every time and money.
- But that's your excuse,

16:01.767 --> 16:02.600
you fall back on that.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.849
- [Karan] These are rooms too,

16:03.849 --> 16:05.956
that I get positive feedback about.

16:05.956 --> 16:07.102
- [Gordon] Oh my God.

16:07.102 --> 16:08.240
- I'm serious.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.449
- There you go again, no,
you can't be that, no.

16:11.449 --> 16:13.091
- No, I'm out of here.

16:13.091 --> 16:17.694
I am not sleeping in this dump.

16:17.694 --> 16:22.694
I'm done, I'm out of here, oh man.

16:24.152 --> 16:25.468
- [Gage] He can't leave.

16:25.468 --> 16:26.903
- [Gordon] I'm not staying in here.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.763
- [Gage] Ramsay, don't go.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.583
(atmospheric music)

16:37.474 --> 16:38.744
- Karan, this is a travesty

16:38.744 --> 16:42.205
that you're paying $130 to get out of bed

16:42.205 --> 16:46.197
and step on a disgusting, stinking carpet.

16:46.197 --> 16:49.414
You're in the danger zone
for unhygienic practises,

16:49.414 --> 16:52.227
then it's not fit for customers.

16:52.227 --> 16:54.778
- We get a lot of bikers,
bicyclists, and hikers.

16:54.778 --> 16:57.520
- [Gordon] Karan, what are you
scared of Karan, admitting?

16:57.520 --> 16:59.622
- Well, I'm working 16
hours a day and spending

16:59.622 --> 17:00.702
every time and money.
- Yeah but that's your excuse,

17:00.702 --> 17:02.035
you fall back on that.

17:02.035 --> 17:03.086
- [Karan] These are rooms too

17:03.086 --> 17:04.976
that I get positive feedback about.

17:04.976 --> 17:06.202
- [Gordon] Oh my God.

17:06.202 --> 17:07.035
- I'm serious.

17:07.035 --> 17:08.619
- There you go again.

17:08.619 --> 17:11.415
No, you can't be that, no.

17:11.415 --> 17:12.391
I'm out of here.

17:12.391 --> 17:17.391
I am not sleeping in this dump.

17:17.484 --> 17:21.272
I'm done, I'm out of here, oh man.

17:22.313 --> 17:27.165
- [Gage] He can't leave, Ramsay.

17:27.165 --> 17:28.464
Don't go.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.214
- [Gordon] I'm not staying in here.

17:33.732 --> 17:35.245
Is this your office in here?

17:35.245 --> 17:37.307
- That's my living quarters
and my office, yes.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.140
- Your what?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.182
- [Karan] I live there.

17:39.182 --> 17:40.260
- You live in here?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.976
- Yeah, let me show you.

17:42.976 --> 17:45.976
(atmospheric music)

17:46.943 --> 17:47.776
- [Gordon] What?

17:47.776 --> 17:51.872
I saw the office sign on the
door, but you live in here?

17:51.872 --> 17:53.476
- Right here.

17:53.476 --> 17:58.476
This is my bed, I just
sleep here like this.

17:59.391 --> 18:01.736
- Are you kidding me?

18:01.736 --> 18:03.143
Every night you sleep in here?

18:03.143 --> 18:04.002
- [Karan] Yes.

18:04.002 --> 18:05.604
- [Gordon] Is there a mattress there?

18:05.604 --> 18:09.711
- [Karan] No, it's just
quilts cover on sheets.

18:09.711 --> 18:12.649
- [Gordon] You sleep on a board?

18:12.649 --> 18:15.365
- Mhm, in the winter I could go upstairs,

18:15.365 --> 18:17.650
but I choose not to,
I choose to stay here.

18:17.650 --> 18:19.468
- And which bathroom
do you use and shower?

18:19.468 --> 18:22.210
- [Karan] I use the ones upstairs, mhm.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.702
- What's the room next door there?

18:24.702 --> 18:25.819
- That's the beverage area

18:25.819 --> 18:27.633
and then beyond that's the kitchen.

18:27.633 --> 18:31.370
- The beverage area?
- Mhm.

18:31.370 --> 18:33.384
The kegerator is right
on the other side there

18:33.384 --> 18:35.579
and then that's the
beverage area right there.

18:35.579 --> 18:37.900
- [Gordon] Oh my God.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.433
- [Karan] In fact, I sort
of sleep in the kitchen.

18:41.759 --> 18:44.235
- This is crazy.

18:44.235 --> 18:45.591
- I love it here,

18:45.591 --> 18:47.461
there's no place in the
world I would rather be.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.187
- You are not doing one thing right.

18:50.187 --> 18:54.424
You have lost it completely
and you've convinced yourself,

18:54.424 --> 18:57.876
in amongst the chaotic
mess that you live in,

18:57.876 --> 18:59.885
that it's all right.

18:59.885 --> 19:02.509
It's not, it's absurd.

19:02.509 --> 19:07.110
This is no way for a lady
to sleep and live and eat.

19:07.110 --> 19:08.570
You shouldn't be living in a kitchen,

19:08.570 --> 19:11.122
there's not even a fan or
an air conditioned room,

19:11.122 --> 19:15.320
it's a tiny cubby hole
cluttered with your junk.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.855
Are you okay?

19:16.855 --> 19:18.410
- I think so.

19:18.410 --> 19:19.825
- This is not normal.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.700
- What's normal?
- What's normal?

19:23.700 --> 19:25.672
Seriously.

19:25.672 --> 19:30.642
I can't even start to
think about helping you

19:30.642 --> 19:33.533
when you're in such denial.

19:37.433 --> 19:41.554
What the fuck!

19:41.554 --> 19:44.554
(atmospheric music)

19:48.582 --> 19:50.107
The next morning, I woke up

19:50.107 --> 19:52.619
not wanting to give up on the Town's Inn.

19:52.619 --> 19:53.956
Seeing how bad the kitchen was

19:53.956 --> 19:56.861
and learning that it wasn't
cleaned for over a year,

19:56.861 --> 20:01.861
I hired a professional cleaning
crew to not only declutter,

20:04.473 --> 20:08.013
but to scrub down the kitchen as well.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.283
Crap everywhere.

20:14.538 --> 20:17.455
(knocking on door)

20:21.904 --> 20:24.025
- Good morning.

20:24.025 --> 20:26.220
- Morning, I don't know about being good.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.773
- Well, could be better could be worse.

20:27.773 --> 20:30.089
- [Gordon] Yes, were you sleeping?

20:30.089 --> 20:32.065
- I was, I've got a
headache, I don't know why.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.470
- You've got a headache?

20:33.470 --> 20:35.410
I've had a headache since I've arrived.

20:35.410 --> 20:37.413
I'm still unconvinced where I'm going

20:37.413 --> 20:39.542
with you and this business,

20:39.542 --> 20:41.314
however, I want you to do something.

20:41.314 --> 20:42.200
- All right.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.123
- [Gordon] Something you
haven't done properly

20:43.123 --> 20:44.633
in a long time.

20:46.515 --> 20:48.019
Take that.
- Yes?

20:48.019 --> 20:50.323
- And start packing.

20:52.159 --> 20:53.027
- Where am I gonna go?

20:53.027 --> 20:53.891
- [Gordon] I'm not messing around,

20:53.891 --> 20:54.798
I haven't got time to mess around.

20:54.798 --> 20:56.114
- Okay, but where?

20:56.114 --> 20:56.947
- Don't worry about that,

20:56.947 --> 21:00.452
I just want you to start
packing up quickly.

21:00.452 --> 21:03.669
(mid tempo music)

21:03.669 --> 21:05.803
I've got enough boxes.

21:15.108 --> 21:15.941
- Moving fast.
- You know

21:15.941 --> 21:16.774
how important this is, yeah?

21:16.774 --> 21:18.740
- I do.
- Time is of the essence,

21:18.740 --> 21:19.933
I need you to start packing.

21:19.933 --> 21:22.337
- [Karan] I'm starting.

21:22.337 --> 21:25.470
- Start packing quickly.

21:25.470 --> 21:28.470
(atmospheric music)

21:29.584 --> 21:31.607
I'm worried about Karan
not listening to me

21:31.607 --> 21:32.979
and I don't think she realises

21:32.979 --> 21:35.587
just how bad the business really is.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.351
I reached out to her son, Jason,

21:37.351 --> 21:39.083
the majority owner of the inn,

21:39.083 --> 21:42.798
who has the most to lose if
Karan fails to turn it around.

21:42.798 --> 21:43.631
Jason, how are you?

21:43.631 --> 21:44.857
- I'm doing well, thanks, yourself?

21:44.857 --> 21:45.950
- Very well, thank you.

21:45.950 --> 21:46.783
- [Jason] Jason Townsend,
nice to meet you.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.667
- Likewise, do you want to take a seat?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.090
First of all, what a beautiful place.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.327
- Yeah, it really is.

21:51.327 --> 21:55.631
- Gorgeous, I've fallen love
with this area beyond belief,

21:55.631 --> 21:58.655
unfortunately, I haven't
fallen in love with the inn.

21:58.655 --> 22:01.872
I'm shocked at the setup

22:01.872 --> 22:05.190
and what's happening
to your mum currently.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.223
Do you have any idea how bad it is?

22:07.223 --> 22:08.304
- I think I have a sense,

22:08.304 --> 22:10.983
but obviously I'm not here
on a daily, regular basis

22:10.983 --> 22:13.720
so don't appreciate the in and outs of it.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.570
- She's in denial,

22:14.570 --> 22:17.211
I'm trying to explain things
to her in a very calm way

22:17.211 --> 22:20.824
and she's just refusing point blank

22:20.824 --> 22:23.040
to understand the logic.

22:23.040 --> 22:23.926
- I think her vision

22:23.926 --> 22:25.396
has been both her blessing and her curse,

22:25.396 --> 22:26.480
in the sense of

22:26.480 --> 22:28.804
it's what's allowed her to drive
through this and persevere,

22:28.804 --> 22:31.047
but it's also what puts her in denial.

22:31.047 --> 22:33.740
- Have you seen where she sleeps?

22:33.740 --> 22:34.690
- Yeah.

22:34.690 --> 22:36.751
- Does that make you feel happy?

22:36.751 --> 22:38.106
- Not at all, not at all.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.128
I mean, we bought this
with two main motivations,

22:40.128 --> 22:42.425
to let her develop this end business

22:42.425 --> 22:44.428
but also have it as grandma's house

22:44.428 --> 22:46.243
and it's not.

22:46.243 --> 22:48.954
We went into this looking at it as,

22:48.954 --> 22:51.117
obviously, we want it to
be some type of investment

22:51.117 --> 22:53.849
but we didn't have a particular game plan

22:53.849 --> 22:56.507
beyond just rent out the space to mom

22:56.507 --> 22:59.818
and we wanna see it do well,
not just to make money,

22:59.818 --> 23:01.720
but so that she really
can have a life here,

23:01.720 --> 23:04.075
and it's just been triage since day one.

23:04.075 --> 23:05.075
- That's no way to live.

23:05.075 --> 23:05.908
- [Jason] No.

23:05.908 --> 23:07.272
- [Gordon] Has this become
a burden on your family now?

23:07.272 --> 23:10.461
- Yeah, it has, it's because
we're concerned for her,

23:10.461 --> 23:13.948
it's a financial burden.

23:13.948 --> 23:15.024
- If this lady wasn't your mother

23:15.024 --> 23:17.165
and she was renting from your property,

23:17.165 --> 23:18.634
you'd be a lot more severe

23:18.634 --> 23:20.838
in the way that place has been handled.

23:20.838 --> 23:22.118
- We all bought this, in part,

23:22.118 --> 23:24.012
with our hearts and not just our heads

23:24.012 --> 23:28.295
and it's that balance between
wanting to respect her desires

23:28.295 --> 23:29.995
to make this business
what she wants it to be,

23:29.995 --> 23:30.978
but also realise

23:30.978 --> 23:33.183
that if it's not gonna
be a profitable business,

23:33.183 --> 23:34.585
and if there's gonna be a cost,

23:34.585 --> 23:36.587
not just financially, but
physically and emotionally,

23:36.587 --> 23:38.528
we need to shut it down.

23:38.528 --> 23:39.533
- Now this is your mum,

23:39.533 --> 23:41.265
this is not a cousin or niece or nephew,

23:41.265 --> 23:44.707
this is your mum so
she needs to hear that.

23:44.707 --> 23:47.247
It's affecting you
personally, financially,

23:47.247 --> 23:48.395
it could drag your family down,

23:48.395 --> 23:51.511
you're not her safety net.

23:51.511 --> 23:54.512
I need you to have a word with her

23:54.512 --> 23:56.290
and how we're not prepared to move forward

23:56.290 --> 23:57.881
unless she's gonna commit to change,

23:57.881 --> 24:00.275
and I'm talking longterm change.

24:00.275 --> 24:03.363
She needs help and she
needs help urgently.

24:06.332 --> 24:09.332
(atmospheric music)

24:11.448 --> 24:14.003
- [Karan] Oh my, I think
I overloaded this one.

24:14.003 --> 24:16.530
- After spending time this
morning with Karan's son,

24:16.530 --> 24:19.865
we both agree in order for
the business to succeed

24:19.865 --> 24:21.794
he needs to confront his mum

24:21.794 --> 24:24.745
that a major change needs to happen.

24:24.745 --> 24:27.512
Well, Karan, first of all,

24:27.512 --> 24:30.849
I spent this morning
catching up with Jason.

24:30.849 --> 24:32.048
- [Karan] Okay, good.

24:32.048 --> 24:33.832
- And just trying to get him up to speed

24:33.832 --> 24:36.788
with what I've been discovering.

24:36.788 --> 24:37.972
You know I'm not happy

24:37.972 --> 24:39.748
and I think, deep down inside,

24:39.748 --> 24:43.348
that you can't be happy
in this current existence,

24:43.348 --> 24:48.348
so I want you to listen to Jason.

24:48.451 --> 24:49.355
- As you know,

24:49.355 --> 24:51.089
we've been talking a lot
about what's going on here,

24:51.089 --> 24:53.717
why we're here, what we
want with the business.

24:53.717 --> 24:56.250
You're my mom, but you're also my tenant

24:56.250 --> 25:00.380
and so I have two main goals
and objectives with this place,

25:00.380 --> 25:04.834
and one is a financial one,
for your sake, for my sake,

25:04.834 --> 25:06.294
for our family's sake,

25:06.294 --> 25:09.028
and then my second
objective is to encourage

25:09.028 --> 25:11.795
and support you and your life.

25:11.795 --> 25:13.920
You're not just an
innkeeper, you're my mom,

25:13.920 --> 25:15.052
you're a grandma,

25:15.052 --> 25:17.718
and for us to enjoy all those things,

25:17.718 --> 25:20.760
we have to, I think,
make some changes here.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.305
It's not sustainable financially,

25:22.305 --> 25:25.633
emotionally, and physically.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.814
- I just don't see the business

25:27.814 --> 25:30.248
in such a negative light as you do,

25:30.248 --> 25:31.676
I look out my window.

25:31.676 --> 25:34.103
- But you realise most people do, yeah.

25:35.688 --> 25:38.569
- I look out my window and
there's the Potomac River

25:38.569 --> 25:39.402
and the train station.

25:39.402 --> 25:41.050
- You can't see out
the window, my darling.

25:41.050 --> 25:43.417
- Oh I can, above it.

25:44.971 --> 25:47.470
- Even the bags of clothes yesterday

25:47.470 --> 25:51.754
and now the boxes of clutter,
people don't live like this.

25:51.754 --> 25:54.497
You have to get out of there

25:54.497 --> 25:57.731
and you have to start living
your life completely different

25:57.731 --> 25:59.065
to what you've been doing.

25:59.065 --> 26:00.501
I'm not here for three months, Karan,

26:00.501 --> 26:03.213
I'm here for a short time to
give you everything I've got

26:03.213 --> 26:04.275
to get this place fixed

26:04.275 --> 26:06.505
and if you can't listen to Jason

26:06.505 --> 26:08.404
and you're not prepared to listen to me,

26:08.404 --> 26:10.116
I'm not asking you any longer.

26:10.116 --> 26:11.379
- We're all working
for the same goal here.

26:11.379 --> 26:12.274
- I'm listening.

26:12.274 --> 26:15.113
- I'm telling you it needs to stop.

26:17.099 --> 26:19.821
- For your sake, for my
sake, for our family's sake,

26:19.821 --> 26:22.622
I can't keep renting the house out to you

26:22.622 --> 26:26.702
if we can't get a business that
is consistently profitable.

26:26.702 --> 26:28.399
- The place is in jeopardy

26:28.399 --> 26:30.919
and there's not one element
functioning properly

26:30.919 --> 26:35.612
and your business is gonna
take Jason's family down

26:35.612 --> 26:38.647
if you don't sort this out.

26:43.446 --> 26:47.223
- I don't want to burden
my children at all,

26:48.312 --> 26:53.312
so that is something that
is high priority for me.

26:54.178 --> 26:56.278
- But you have to come
to terms with yourself

26:56.278 --> 27:00.726
that it's broken, it's wrong,
and you have to change.

27:00.726 --> 27:04.330
- And I'm willing, whatever
you propose I'll try.

27:04.330 --> 27:06.527
- Otherwise it's game over.

27:06.527 --> 27:08.017
- Let's move forward.

27:08.017 --> 27:11.495
- I am agreeing to help, I'm
gonna put a plan in place,

27:11.495 --> 27:16.495
but you can't continue the way
you're doing, you know that.

27:17.466 --> 27:18.573
Thank you Jason.

27:18.573 --> 27:21.323
- Thank you Gordon.
- Thank you.

27:23.395 --> 27:25.181
Do you know what his plan is?

27:25.181 --> 27:26.743
- I have no idea.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.817
(atmospheric music)

27:32.817 --> 27:34.982
- After Karan packed up her belongings,

27:34.982 --> 27:37.335
I had my team start the renovation process

27:37.335 --> 27:41.313
while I found a place close
by for Karan to move into.

27:42.612 --> 27:44.630
Hi Karan, are you well?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.316
- I'm very well, thank you.

27:46.316 --> 27:50.223
- Good, let's step inside,
something I'd like to show you.

27:51.616 --> 27:53.313
Come in, please.

27:56.890 --> 27:58.290
- What a lovely place.

27:58.290 --> 27:59.822
- Do you like it?
- I do.

27:59.822 --> 28:01.538
- What do you like about it?

28:01.538 --> 28:03.272
- Well, it's not cluttered.

28:03.272 --> 28:04.508
- [Gordon] It's not cluttered, is it?

28:04.508 --> 28:05.932
- [Karan] Yes, I like that.

28:05.932 --> 28:08.248
- When I saw the way you've been living

28:08.248 --> 28:12.451
for the last 12 months, I was appalled,

28:12.451 --> 28:17.026
you shouldn't be going to
bed on a piece of wood.

28:17.026 --> 28:17.859
- I know.

28:17.859 --> 28:19.766
- You shouldn't be doing that.

28:19.766 --> 28:23.790
If we're gonna make a change,
then you have to step back

28:23.790 --> 28:25.737
and I mean step back from the business,

28:25.737 --> 28:28.897
and that means giving yourself some space.

28:28.897 --> 28:31.602
So I've done something

28:31.602 --> 28:33.753
and I'm paying for it out of my own pocket

28:33.753 --> 28:38.372
and I've rented this space for you

28:38.372 --> 28:40.670
for the next couple of months, two months.

28:40.670 --> 28:41.803
- Two months,

28:41.803 --> 28:42.843
okay, that's great.
- Two months.

28:42.843 --> 28:47.704
Give yourself a break, you
can relax, watch a bit of TV.

28:47.704 --> 28:50.856
- I haven't had a television since 1993,

28:50.856 --> 28:55.210
so this is really a big
change, yeah, since 1993.

28:55.210 --> 28:57.770
- Even if you're not gonna watch TV,

28:57.770 --> 28:59.807
read, relax.
- That I can do.

28:59.807 --> 29:01.622
- And just take in the view.

29:01.622 --> 29:03.773
And if you decide to move back in there

29:03.773 --> 29:05.726
and you convert one of the rooms,

29:05.726 --> 29:07.790
and it's got an on suite bathroom,
that's all fair and well,

29:07.790 --> 29:12.790
but then you need to separate
the difference, not in a box.

29:12.887 --> 29:15.729
- I like this, I feel comfortable here.

29:15.729 --> 29:16.712
- Have a look upstairs,

29:16.712 --> 29:19.594
there's a beautiful bedroom
there and a full size bed.

29:19.594 --> 29:21.461
- [Karan] Alright.

29:21.461 --> 29:24.112
- There's a en suite bathroom

29:24.112 --> 29:25.860
and a wardrobe to yourself.
- I see, yes,

29:25.860 --> 29:28.935
a big bathroom.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.123
Very nice.

29:32.235 --> 29:34.902
(playful music)

29:37.112 --> 29:39.133
I could go to sleep right now.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.911
Wake me up in two hours.

29:43.911 --> 29:46.005
- We've got work to do!

29:46.005 --> 29:49.623
- Oh okay, all right.

29:51.631 --> 29:53.903
That was comfortable.

29:53.903 --> 29:58.903
- Karan, you need to start
thinking about being a boss,

29:59.458 --> 30:00.634
being an owner,

30:00.634 --> 30:03.270
with that comes certain responsibilities.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.080
What is it like for you to be an owner,

30:05.080 --> 30:06.351
what's the importance?

30:06.351 --> 30:09.183
- Well, the important
thing was serving the guest

30:09.183 --> 30:13.079
and trying to nurture a good
relationship with my employees.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.181
- Right, that means
setting an example, yes?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.014
- Yes.

30:16.014 --> 30:17.635
- And being the face of the inn.

30:17.635 --> 30:18.966
- Yes.
- Right,

30:18.966 --> 30:21.637
what do you think is
the most important thing

30:21.637 --> 30:24.453
about being the face of a business?

30:25.362 --> 30:29.798
Having a presence,
standing out like an owner.

30:29.798 --> 30:30.631
- Okay.

30:30.631 --> 30:32.650
- So you need to walk this historic town

30:32.650 --> 30:36.152
looking like an innkeeper, polished.

30:36.152 --> 30:37.786
- Okay.
- Now, I feel bad

30:37.786 --> 30:40.210
about asking a lady to glamorise herself,

30:40.210 --> 30:42.142
so I'm not trying to be detrimental,

30:42.142 --> 30:47.000
I'm gonna send you off for a makeover.

30:47.000 --> 30:47.833
- Okay.

30:48.870 --> 30:51.415
- When was the last time
you went and had a facial,

30:51.415 --> 30:52.289
got your hair done,

30:52.289 --> 30:56.622
and bought a new dress
with a bright colour?

30:56.622 --> 30:59.962
- I don't think I've done
that since I was 13 years old.

30:59.962 --> 31:02.973
- When was the last time
you went for a blow dry?

31:04.650 --> 31:09.650
- Never, I have a blow dryer,
but I never go to a salon.

31:10.310 --> 31:12.629
- Right, when was the last
time you had your nails done?

31:12.629 --> 31:13.987
- Never.

31:13.987 --> 31:16.401
- Never?
- Correct.

31:16.401 --> 31:18.334
That was never a priority for me,

31:18.334 --> 31:21.056
but you're teaching me something here.

31:21.056 --> 31:24.019
- We're gonna make it a
priority because it's about you,

31:24.019 --> 31:25.674
it's a business, you have to front it

31:25.674 --> 31:27.849
and that comes with an image.

31:27.849 --> 31:28.967
- Yeah.

31:28.967 --> 31:31.046
- I'm glad you're up for a change.

31:31.046 --> 31:33.173
I want you to feel better, I
want you to enjoy your life,

31:33.173 --> 31:36.220
I want you to appreciate
what your team can do for you

31:36.220 --> 31:39.088
and hopefully just break
the mould a little bit.

31:39.088 --> 31:40.149
- 100%.

31:40.149 --> 31:41.582
- You're happy with this?

31:41.582 --> 31:44.913
- I'm ready to enjoy
it, thank you so much.

31:44.913 --> 31:46.566
- Thank you, I have a
security deposit here,

31:46.566 --> 31:48.929
so it's a rental, no murals, yeah?

31:48.929 --> 31:51.098
- All right, we'll leave
it the way we found it.

31:51.098 --> 31:52.912
- Thank you, see you so shortly.

31:52.912 --> 31:53.900
- All the best to you.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.203
- Do you want me to turn
on the TV for you or not?

31:55.203 --> 31:58.224
- Not yet, I'm gonna take
this one step at a time.

31:58.224 --> 31:59.715
- YouTube?

31:59.715 --> 32:01.880
- I've seen a few things on YouTube, yeah.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.381
- Instagram?

32:03.381 --> 32:06.020
- Never, but my
granddaughter is teaching me.

32:06.020 --> 32:06.994
- Selfie?

32:06.994 --> 32:09.344
- Taking a picture of myself, oh never.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.512
- Tinder?

32:10.512 --> 32:12.533
- I don't even know what that is.

32:14.578 --> 32:16.098
Welcome to the dark ages.

32:16.098 --> 32:17.740
- [Gordon] Enjoy.

32:17.740 --> 32:20.740
(atmospheric music)

32:22.601 --> 32:24.596
This was one of the toughest makeovers

32:24.596 --> 32:26.756
my team has ever taken on.

32:26.756 --> 32:28.887
We had not only moved Karan
out of the Town's Inn,

32:28.887 --> 32:33.420
but packed up all her clutter
before transforming the space.

32:33.420 --> 32:34.577
Good morning, how are you feeling?

32:34.577 --> 32:35.410
- [Employees] Excited!

32:35.410 --> 32:37.057
- Excited, the sun is shining

32:37.057 --> 32:40.015
and there seems to be a new
bright breath of fresh air

32:40.015 --> 32:41.864
on the Town's Inn.

32:41.864 --> 32:43.820
We're missing somebody.

32:43.820 --> 32:44.653
- Karan.
- We are.

32:44.653 --> 32:47.523
- She's been busy over the last 24 hours,

32:47.523 --> 32:50.210
I'm hoping you notice a change.

32:50.210 --> 32:51.872
- Oh my God.

32:51.872 --> 32:53.122
Oh look at her!

32:54.080 --> 32:55.992
- [Brenda] She looks beautiful.

32:55.992 --> 32:59.559
- I don't even dress like
this to go to church, do I?

32:59.559 --> 33:02.190
- Now somebody's looking
like an owner of an inn.

33:02.190 --> 33:03.480
You look amazing.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.263
- For someone with an
Amish/Mennonite lifestyle,

33:06.263 --> 33:08.877
yeah, I look radically different.

33:08.877 --> 33:10.390
- You look amazing.

33:10.390 --> 33:11.708
- [Gage] You look so different.

33:11.708 --> 33:14.278
- Karan, you look good, really good.

33:14.278 --> 33:15.256
- Are you ready to go inside?

33:15.256 --> 33:17.331
- I've been dreaming of this moment.

33:17.331 --> 33:20.006
- Right, follow me, let's go.

33:20.006 --> 33:21.483
Come on, all of you.

33:23.415 --> 33:24.832
- Oh my God, yay!

33:27.284 --> 33:28.534
Oh my goodness.

33:29.781 --> 33:31.535
- [Karan] It's beautiful.

33:31.535 --> 33:32.922
- [Gordon] What's missing?

33:32.922 --> 33:33.948
- My bed.

33:33.948 --> 33:38.948
- Karan's bed, isn't this
what a inn should look like?

33:40.595 --> 33:43.445
A tiny little convenience
store that is bright

33:43.445 --> 33:45.248
and modern and everything is on view,

33:45.248 --> 33:47.425
and even if you're not staying in the inn,

33:47.425 --> 33:49.404
guests will come in and buy stuff,

33:49.404 --> 33:50.637
you can sell stuff properly,

33:50.637 --> 33:51.852
it's a proper little boutique.

33:51.852 --> 33:54.383
- I'm overwhelmed.

33:54.383 --> 33:57.328
- It looks amazing, amazing.

33:57.328 --> 34:00.179
- What Gordon has done is phenomenal,

34:00.179 --> 34:02.201
the store here looks great,

34:02.201 --> 34:05.587
it's like walking into
a whole 'nother place.

34:05.587 --> 34:06.823
- Please.

34:07.717 --> 34:08.840
- Whoa.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.158
- Gone is the dust.

34:10.158 --> 34:12.250
- [Sarah] Oh my goodness.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.518
- [Karan] Well done.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.351
- [Sarah] Look at that!

34:14.351 --> 34:16.092
- Beautiful design, beautiful.

34:16.092 --> 34:17.746
- [Gordon] When I walked into
this dining room first off,

34:17.746 --> 34:20.235
it was dreary and laden with junk,

34:20.235 --> 34:23.023
and now we have a proper dining room.

34:24.310 --> 34:27.051
- Oh lovely, look at the all day menu.

34:27.051 --> 34:29.762
- The menu hangs on the
wall, it's written daily

34:29.762 --> 34:31.978
according to what you've
got available, Jeff.

34:31.978 --> 34:33.000
- [Jeff] Yes.

34:33.000 --> 34:33.833
- [Gordon] And when we
run out, we run out,

34:33.833 --> 34:35.129
we tear it off and we start again.

34:35.129 --> 34:35.962
If you turn around,

34:35.962 --> 34:37.697
you'll see the custom artwork on the wall,

34:37.697 --> 34:39.237
please do not paint over that.

34:39.237 --> 34:40.886
- I will not, I will promise you.

34:40.886 --> 34:41.802
- Promise me.

34:41.802 --> 34:44.010
- No problem, I love it!

34:44.010 --> 34:46.654
- That's the only mural we
need on the wall, just that.

34:46.654 --> 34:48.228
- Enough is enough.

34:48.228 --> 34:49.893
- Right, you ready to see upstairs?

34:49.893 --> 34:51.195
- Yes!

34:51.195 --> 34:52.353
- [Gordon] As you come up,

34:52.353 --> 34:55.080
have a little look of
the hallway first please.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.969
- [Sarah] Oh wow.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.722
- Gone are the baskets.

34:58.722 --> 34:59.905
Anyone wants to do a little bit of work,

34:59.905 --> 35:00.810
a little bit writing,

35:00.810 --> 35:03.150
you can sit here.
- Absolutely wow.

35:03.150 --> 35:03.983
- Jump in.

35:03.983 --> 35:04.816
- Everything's gorgeous.
- Jump in.

35:04.816 --> 35:06.530
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh my God.

35:06.530 --> 35:07.363
- [Sarah] This is the Potomac room?

35:07.363 --> 35:08.907
- [Gordon] That's right.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.006
- What a vision!
- Can't believe

35:10.006 --> 35:13.181
it's the same room.

35:13.181 --> 35:16.102
- [Gordon] New sheets, new
bedding, and a new carpet.

35:16.102 --> 35:17.633
- [Karan] It's beautiful.

35:19.135 --> 35:20.907
- Wow.
- Oh my God.

35:20.907 --> 35:22.063
- [Gordon] No more murals on the wall,

35:22.063 --> 35:24.412
we have a nice stunning walls.

35:24.412 --> 35:25.390
- [Sarah] I love it.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.232
- No more Brillo pads in
the wall, they've gone.

35:27.232 --> 35:28.378
- I love it.

35:28.378 --> 35:30.599
- You have your very own wardrobe.

35:30.599 --> 35:32.202
- [Karan] No padlock on it.

35:32.202 --> 35:33.541
- How nice is that?

35:33.541 --> 35:35.223
Yes, you can use a wardrobe.

35:35.223 --> 35:37.453
- It is exquisite.

35:37.453 --> 35:40.470
My family thinks I'm so set in my ways

35:40.470 --> 35:42.350
that I'm not gonna like
any of these changes

35:42.350 --> 35:45.510
and I'm gonna go right
back to the old way,

35:45.510 --> 35:46.373
I know that's what they're thinking,

35:46.373 --> 35:49.483
and they couldn't be
further from the truth.

35:50.848 --> 35:54.294
(atmospheric music)

35:54.294 --> 35:55.960
- [Gordon] My team has
spent the last two days

35:55.960 --> 35:59.009
cleaning out the kitchen by
getting rid of the microwaves,

35:59.009 --> 36:02.008
refrigerators, and freezers.

36:02.008 --> 36:03.886
I've created a much smaller menu

36:03.886 --> 36:06.651
that is manageable for the
kitchen staff to execute.

36:06.651 --> 36:09.736
Please take your menu and pass them on.

36:09.736 --> 36:11.119
- Wow, wow.

36:11.119 --> 36:12.447
- Karan, what do you think?

36:12.447 --> 36:15.010
- Couldn't be more
beautiful and appealing.

36:15.010 --> 36:15.843
- Isn't it?
- Mhm.

36:15.843 --> 36:18.808
- Now, let's be real, the kitchen is tiny,

36:18.808 --> 36:21.094
so a small dynamic menu,

36:21.094 --> 36:24.064
as the seasons change we go
through to spring and summer

36:24.064 --> 36:25.840
then we'll increase on a daily special

36:25.840 --> 36:29.604
only according to what
business is about, okay?

36:29.604 --> 36:30.604
- That makes sense.

36:30.604 --> 36:32.309
- And so we're not buying unnecessary

36:32.309 --> 36:35.271
and we're not adding 10 more
appetisers and entrees on there

36:35.271 --> 36:37.759
just because we want to look busy, no.

36:37.759 --> 36:38.980
- Keep it plain and simple.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.835
- Keep it plain, delicious, and simple.

36:40.835 --> 36:42.270
Let's go through the dishes.

36:42.270 --> 36:43.981
A high-street burger.

36:43.981 --> 36:45.331
- [Jeff] No water.

36:45.331 --> 36:46.830
- No water.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.949
A beautiful paté wonderfully seasoned,

36:48.949 --> 36:52.527
a griddle in there to sear
and cook them to order.

36:52.527 --> 36:56.676
Chicken pot pie, little modern
twist on a salad niçoise,

36:56.676 --> 36:57.956
but we've done it with salmon.

36:57.956 --> 37:00.637
Homemade granola, seasonal berries,

37:00.637 --> 37:04.071
cheap and easy to put
out that tiny kitchen.

37:04.071 --> 37:05.720
And then, of course, the mac and cheese,

37:05.720 --> 37:07.303
it does not go in the microwave.

37:07.303 --> 37:09.608
- What's that, what's that?

37:09.608 --> 37:12.123
- The sports bar microwaves have gone.

37:13.112 --> 37:14.426
Visually, what do you think?

37:14.426 --> 37:15.259
- [Karan] It's beautiful.

37:15.259 --> 37:17.327
- Simple and fast.

37:17.327 --> 37:18.597
And it takes a big load off in the kitchen

37:18.597 --> 37:21.815
and we're not buying
frozen, it's all fresh.

37:21.815 --> 37:25.140
Right, knife and fork,
and have a little taste.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.658
- Oh man, that is good.

37:27.658 --> 37:28.667
- Oh my.

37:28.667 --> 37:31.138
- That's like mama's macaroni and cheese.

37:31.138 --> 37:33.061
- People will drive from Washington DC

37:33.061 --> 37:35.349
to come here and eat this way.

37:35.349 --> 37:36.182
- So good.

37:37.357 --> 37:40.190
(mid tempo music)

37:41.102 --> 37:42.786
- Tonight the Town's Inn

37:42.786 --> 37:45.248
relaunches the inn and the restaurant.

37:45.248 --> 37:46.364
Right, how we feeling?

37:46.364 --> 37:47.197
- [Staff] Good.

37:47.197 --> 37:48.395
- We ready?
- Yeah.

37:48.395 --> 37:49.653
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

37:49.653 --> 37:52.209
- Tough week, but it's been instrumental.

37:52.209 --> 37:55.387
Let's put this place
back on the map, okay.

37:55.387 --> 37:57.137
Push the freshness of the menu,

37:57.137 --> 37:58.444
I don't want anybody panicking

37:58.444 --> 38:00.274
there's nothing we can't do on the menu.

38:00.274 --> 38:02.518
Any issues, we talk about it.

38:02.518 --> 38:05.738
If we talk to each other, we
prevent mistakes happening.

38:05.738 --> 38:08.249
If we shut down, things will
happen without us knowing.

38:08.249 --> 38:09.845
Karan, anything you'd
like to say to the team?

38:09.845 --> 38:12.550
- Thank you and I'm looking
forward to moving forward.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.452
- Thank you Karan.
- That's great.

38:14.452 --> 38:15.949
- Good luck, let's go guys.

38:15.949 --> 38:18.782
(uplifting music)

38:21.644 --> 38:24.187
Let me help you down the
stairs, good to see you.

38:24.187 --> 38:25.475
- Welcome to the Town's Inn,

38:25.475 --> 38:27.511
you're checking in, it looks like.

38:27.511 --> 38:29.423
- [Gordon] Immediately
the guests see the changes

38:29.423 --> 38:31.711
in the dining room and the rooms.

38:31.711 --> 38:33.089
- It's beautiful, yeah.

38:33.089 --> 38:35.347
- Wow look at this, very nice.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.997
- [Customer] I love this bed.

38:36.997 --> 38:38.137
- This is pretty nice.

38:38.137 --> 38:39.654
Oh look at this, you get a nice armoire.

38:39.654 --> 38:40.937
Can throw our stuff in here.

38:40.937 --> 38:42.638
- [Gage] How do you like it the changes?

38:42.638 --> 38:43.570
Looks good.

38:43.570 --> 38:44.800
- It looks great.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.127
- I can definitely say this
is way better than last year.

38:47.127 --> 38:50.150
- This is definitely an improvement, yes.

38:50.150 --> 38:51.429
- Here's to.
- Cheers.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.645
- New restaurant in town.
- Indeed.

38:53.645 --> 38:56.135
- That's a burger with french fries, BLT,

38:56.135 --> 38:57.319
and a mac and cheese.

38:57.319 --> 38:58.300
- Great.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.558
The kitchen is functioning
more efficiently

38:59.558 --> 39:01.017
with a smaller menu

39:01.017 --> 39:03.593
and is preparing the
dishes cooked to order,

39:03.593 --> 39:06.435
and Karan is overseeing
the inn as an owner

39:06.435 --> 39:09.231
and successfully treating
this place like a business

39:09.231 --> 39:10.798
for the first time.

39:10.798 --> 39:12.261
- How's everything so far?

39:12.261 --> 39:13.485
I heard you like the soup?

39:13.485 --> 39:14.832
- The soup is fabulous.

39:14.832 --> 39:16.655
- [June] Order in, please.

39:16.655 --> 39:18.273
- I got five minutes on the burger, chef.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.067
- And we got two orders of fries.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.810
- Nice and crispy the fries
and seasoned beautifully, yes?

39:22.810 --> 39:24.091
- [Jeff] Yes sir, chef.

39:24.091 --> 39:25.600
- [Gordon] Well done.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.970
- That is outstanding.

39:27.970 --> 39:29.937
- So now we have a place
to come in the wintertime.

39:29.937 --> 39:30.901
- Good, so you're gonna come back?

39:30.901 --> 39:31.866
- Yeah, we're locals.

39:31.866 --> 39:32.699
- What does it mean,

39:32.699 --> 39:34.606
a small little local bistro to the town?

39:34.606 --> 39:35.607
How good is that for you?

39:35.607 --> 39:39.851
- Actually, it's huge, we need
more local bistros like this.

39:39.851 --> 39:42.152
We're really excited to have it.

39:42.152 --> 39:45.924
- Good to see you, take care, good night.

39:45.924 --> 39:47.543
- Thank you guys.

39:47.543 --> 39:49.277
- Have a good night.
- Goodnight, thank you.

39:49.277 --> 39:50.224
- Take care, goodnight.

39:50.224 --> 39:53.043
Happy customers, wow.

39:54.715 --> 39:57.090
I'm off, thank you man.

39:57.090 --> 39:57.923
- You're welcome.

39:57.923 --> 39:58.756
- Don't lose that passion.

39:58.756 --> 39:59.589
- [Jeff] I won't.

39:59.589 --> 40:02.552
- Continue enhancing this
kitchen and stick together.

40:02.552 --> 40:03.851
You're strong together, you two,

40:03.851 --> 40:05.102
yeah?
- We are.

40:05.102 --> 40:06.571
Thank you Gordon, I love you.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.380
- You too, take care.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.324
Right, see you soon,
look after each other.

40:11.324 --> 40:12.700
- We will.

40:14.337 --> 40:17.353
- Tonight proved that this place can work,

40:17.353 --> 40:19.017
the potential is incredible.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.553
The locals are dying to see this place

40:20.553 --> 40:22.825
at the forefront of this amazing town.

40:22.825 --> 40:24.509
The area is historic,

40:24.509 --> 40:28.680
make sure your inn follows down that line.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.222
Karan, I know changes are gonna be hard,

40:30.222 --> 40:31.654
I know you're gonna resist,

40:31.654 --> 40:34.914
but you cannot afford to go
back you've got to go forward.

40:34.914 --> 40:36.314
I know how much this means to you

40:36.314 --> 40:38.794
and I know what kind
of jeopardy is at stake

40:38.794 --> 40:42.021
if it doesn't work, so
think of the consequences.

40:42.021 --> 40:44.811
It's not just you, it's
your son, your son's family,

40:44.811 --> 40:46.736
and the legacy that you
want to continue with.

40:46.736 --> 40:50.156
So I'm leaving you all
the tools, push forward.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.322
Promise me you're not gonna
go back to your old ways.

40:52.322 --> 40:55.149
- No, this is more fun and more effective

40:55.149 --> 40:58.291
and I've seen the positive
response from everybody,

40:58.291 --> 41:00.812
you did the groundwork here, so thank you.

41:00.812 --> 41:02.838
- Thank you, you have an amazing inn.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.843
- Amazing location, beautiful village.

41:04.843 --> 41:08.067
- Do not move those clothes
back in from Lamont's basement,

41:08.067 --> 41:10.549
get rid of this stuff, let
it fly off the shelves,

41:10.549 --> 41:14.171
and start getting this
place back on the map

41:14.171 --> 41:16.002
and enjoy that lovely little cottage.

41:16.002 --> 41:18.340
Take time out and spend
time with the grandkids

41:18.340 --> 41:21.503
and just let the business breathe.

41:21.503 --> 41:23.514
Promise me, promise.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.813
- [Karan] I promise, yes.

41:24.813 --> 41:26.033
- [Gordon] Pinkie?

41:27.070 --> 41:28.109
- All right.

41:28.109 --> 41:31.538
Gordon's visit has been
extremely educational.

41:31.538 --> 41:35.505
This is good, this is right,
this is what it should be.

41:35.505 --> 41:36.910
Thank you.

41:36.910 --> 41:40.346
I want the inn to be successful
and I think it will be now.

41:40.346 --> 41:43.026
- [Gordon] Take care now, thanks Karan.

41:43.026 --> 41:44.083
- Goodnight.

41:46.943 --> 41:47.776
Wow.

41:47.776 --> 41:49.060
- And that's it.
- That's it.

41:50.148 --> 41:54.073
Wait, come back, come back.

41:54.073 --> 41:57.531
- He's gone.
- I don't want to see him go.

41:57.531 --> 42:00.531
(atmospheric music)

42:01.554 --> 42:03.223
- [Gordon] Since my visit,

42:03.223 --> 42:05.250
Karan has continued to lease the house

42:05.250 --> 42:07.483
I had previously rented for her

42:07.483 --> 42:09.124
and has been listening to her staff

42:09.124 --> 42:11.137
to make positive changes.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.296
- That is awesome.

42:12.296 --> 42:13.341
- [Gordon] And her son Jason

42:13.341 --> 42:14.891
has gotten involved with the business

42:14.891 --> 42:17.005
to help Karan meet their goals

42:17.005 --> 42:18.373
and both are happy to report

42:18.373 --> 42:21.403
business is heading in
the right direction.

42:56.721 --> 42:59.638
- [Matilda] One Potato Two Potato.
