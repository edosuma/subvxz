WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:04.762
It's me, Matt, your son.

00:04.830 --> 00:07.560
That is not my quarterback, you're my quarterback.
You understand that?

00:07.666 --> 00:11.102
We had a meeting, the funds are frozen.
Who had a meeting?

00:11.169 --> 00:14.798
All the people that I've been out trying
to get money from for the JumboTron.

00:14.873 --> 00:17.000
I'm sorry it happened
this way, Tami. Mmm-hmm.

00:17.075 --> 00:19.339
People have warned me about
getting into this with you.

00:19.411 --> 00:21.538
I tell them that
you're a good guy.

00:21.613 --> 00:23.171
You are, right?
Yeah.

00:23.248 --> 00:24.909
What's up, Coach?
Two weeks' time.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.644
You got a walk-on
at Texas A&M.

00:26.718 --> 00:27.946
I'll make you proud.

00:32.290 --> 00:35.953
At this time we ask that you stand
and remove cover for our national anthem.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.231
Ladies and gentlemen, the time
has come for the Clark County...

00:45.303 --> 00:47.396
But before we get started,

00:47.706 --> 00:49.697
before we introduce
our young kids to the arena...

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.890 --> 01:06.381
That's an angry horse,
right there.

01:07.093 --> 01:08.617
Who wanted the cotton candy?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.855
I'll have some.
I'll have some.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.921
You want it?
Aren't you gonna have any?

01:12.999 --> 01:14.193
No, I'm not having any.

01:14.267 --> 01:15.700
Why?
I was going to get y'all some.

01:15.768 --> 01:19.067
I'm having my wisdom teeth
taken out tomorrow.

01:19.539 --> 01:22.167
I'm not trying to gum up...
Something funny?

01:22.241 --> 01:24.436
No. I'm having a major
surgery and you're laughing.

01:24.510 --> 01:25.704
You're just gonna
laugh in my face.

01:25.778 --> 01:27.211
They give you laughing gas.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.373
I don't think laughing gas
is a laughing matter.

01:29.449 --> 01:31.076
I'm sorry. It's...

01:31.851 --> 01:34.513
How about I come over afterwards
and nurse you back to health?

01:34.587 --> 01:35.611
We'll watch a movie
or something.

01:35.688 --> 01:37.679
Can you guys focus for two seconds?
Cash is up next.

01:37.757 --> 01:39.725
All he needs is an 80 to win.

01:39.792 --> 01:41.919
Come on, Cash!
Let's go, man!

01:47.233 --> 01:50.225
A score over 80
will be first place

01:50.303 --> 01:52.271
for Dillon, Texas, man.

01:52.338 --> 01:56.035
Holding on for a full
eight seconds. He's there!

01:57.710 --> 02:00.736
Ooh!
That is one fine-ass cowboy.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.346
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

02:03.549 --> 02:07.679
82.82
for Cash Waller.

02:10.356 --> 02:14.759
The winner of our rodeo, your
hometown cowboy from Dillon, Texas.

02:14.827 --> 02:16.419
Cash Waller!

02:23.536 --> 02:25.060
Come on. Drive the feet.
Drive the feet.

02:25.138 --> 02:27.038
Damn it, drive your legs!
I'm driving them.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.631
No, you're not driving your legs!
Hut!

02:30.243 --> 02:33.303
Go! Drive! Drive!

02:34.013 --> 02:35.878
There you go.
Get something to drink.

02:38.351 --> 02:39.943
They change the walk-on date?

02:40.019 --> 02:42.078
That's right.
You got an extra 24 hours.

02:42.155 --> 02:44.089
Why'd they change it?
I guess they're busy.

02:44.157 --> 02:46.591
Mitch thinks you got a better chance
with Helling on Sunday, anyway.

02:46.659 --> 02:48.627
Whoa, whoa. Who's Mitch?

02:48.861 --> 02:50.852
What's that?
Who's Mitch, anyway?

02:50.930 --> 02:52.898
Mitch Stallman.
He's the one who set everything up.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.796
Is he pretty tight
with Coach Helling?

02:54.867 --> 02:56.095
Yeah, he is.

02:56.169 --> 02:59.935
So, who's he? Offensive coordinator?
Running back coach?

03:00.006 --> 03:02.531
I tell you what.
Why don't you worry a little bit less

03:02.608 --> 03:03.768
about who Mitch Stallman is,

03:03.843 --> 03:07.301
and a little bit more about
yourself on Sunday. How's that?

03:07.380 --> 03:08.642
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

03:08.748 --> 03:10.807
Hut! Drive,
damn it. Come on!

03:24.665 --> 03:27.998
So $10,000 for riding
a horse, huh?

03:28.101 --> 03:31.366
Yeah, well, he wasn't that into it,
but my landlord's gonna be happy.

03:33.173 --> 03:34.868
Tyra Collette, man.

03:35.142 --> 03:38.509
Billy never mentioned that Mindy's
little sister turned into a goddess.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.547
That's, um...

03:44.551 --> 03:48.214
So you gonna be in town for a
while or you just stopping by?

03:48.288 --> 03:50.085
Yeah, actually, I am.

03:52.025 --> 03:53.993
So what happened with that guy
who was with y'all?

03:54.061 --> 03:55.289
Landry?

03:55.362 --> 03:59.230
Oh, he's all nervous.
He's getting his wisdom teeth pulled tomorrow.

03:59.299 --> 04:00.391
Oh, I hate that.

04:00.467 --> 04:01.491
Yeah.

04:01.568 --> 04:05.504
So is he your boyfriend?
'Cause, you know, I respect that if he is.

04:05.572 --> 04:07.437
No, no. God, no.

04:07.908 --> 04:08.932
We're just friends.

04:09.009 --> 04:10.601
Oh, just friends, huh?
Yeah.

04:10.677 --> 04:12.008
That's all.

04:13.914 --> 04:16.245
You wanna dance?
You wanna dance? Okay.

05:36.397 --> 05:38.024
Hey, honey.
I'm sure getting hungry.

05:38.099 --> 05:40.090
Sorry, Grandma.
Your oatmeal is almost ready.

05:40.168 --> 05:43.262
Ooh, it's Tuesday.
I want that milk toast on Tuesday.

05:43.338 --> 05:46.034
No, it's Thursday,
and you get the oatmeal.

05:46.107 --> 05:48.405
Well, I just don't
want oatmeal today.

05:48.476 --> 05:50.774
Please, look, it's cinnamon and apple.
You like it. Come on.

05:50.845 --> 05:53.075
Landry can't give me a ride,
so I gotta catch the bus.

05:53.147 --> 05:55.775
Who is that J.D. McCoy
they're showing on the TV?

05:55.850 --> 05:57.818
J.D. McCoy,
waiting in the wings.

05:57.885 --> 05:59.284
He's nobody.

05:59.921 --> 06:02.412
It's a bye week, so they're just trying
to find something to talk about.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.458
Yeah, they don't
do that on you.

06:04.525 --> 06:05.787
Be good.

06:10.865 --> 06:12.093
I'm not gonna eat that.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.932
So you got it, Bill?
Looking good, right here. That'll be good.

06:16.003 --> 06:16.992
Hey, y'all.

06:17.505 --> 06:18.631
Ah, this is the principal.

06:18.706 --> 06:19.695
Hey, Buddy.

06:19.774 --> 06:21.674
Hey. You mind me asking
what y'all are doing?

06:21.743 --> 06:26.806
Nothing. Well, just a little preliminary
survey for the new scoreboard.

06:26.881 --> 06:28.109
On whose authority?

06:28.182 --> 06:30.776
Uh... Well, mine, I guess.

06:31.953 --> 06:35.081
That's funny. You know you don't
have that kind of authority, Buddy.

06:35.156 --> 06:36.783
I don't?
No. You sure don't.

06:36.858 --> 06:40.123
We have a meeting this week with the
board to discuss this JumboTron.

06:40.194 --> 06:42.059
Tami, I know
we have a board meeting,

06:42.130 --> 06:44.621
but I have an obligation
to the boosters to be ready

06:44.699 --> 06:46.792
just in case our side wins.
No, no, no, no.

06:46.868 --> 06:48.631
No, no, I know what
you are trying to do.

06:48.703 --> 06:50.500
You are trying to bully
this thing through.

06:50.571 --> 06:51.663
And it's not gonna happen.

06:51.773 --> 06:53.638
You know what?
I'm gonna go in front of that board

06:53.708 --> 06:56.302
and I'm gonna make sure Superintendent
Dunley hears what I'm saying.

06:56.377 --> 06:59.369
Well, Paul wants to hear what you have to say.
He's very interested.

06:59.447 --> 07:02.678
He told me that this weekend
at the country club.

07:03.151 --> 07:05.949
You played golf with
Paul Dunley this weekend?

07:06.020 --> 07:08.784
I play with him all the time.
I've known him forever.

07:08.856 --> 07:10.983
He buys all his cars from me.

07:12.226 --> 07:14.251
Put it on your cheek.
Why is it so bright?

07:14.328 --> 07:16.193
It's outside.
It's daytime.

07:16.264 --> 07:17.822
Let me know if you
feel like you're gonna fall.

07:17.899 --> 07:20.367
Step! You okay?

07:20.435 --> 07:22.335
You just saved my life.

07:22.637 --> 07:27.040
I'm so glad you came to pick me up in the
minivan, because I love this minivan.

07:27.108 --> 07:31.205
Yeah.
It's a sign of comfort for me.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.542
I'm so glad.

07:34.583 --> 07:35.675
Hello?

07:35.751 --> 07:36.843
Hello.

07:36.919 --> 07:38.580
Are you done?
How did it go?

07:38.654 --> 07:41.088
Oh, it went great.

07:41.156 --> 07:45.252
They were playing Lionel Ritchie's Lady.
And I love that song.

07:45.761 --> 07:48.286
And listen.
You listening? Mmm-hmm.

07:48.363 --> 07:55.235
I think me, you and Repo Man and a
bunch of Cherry Garcia, at my house...

07:55.304 --> 07:58.467
I think that sounds like a fantastic idea.
That's what that sounds like.

07:58.540 --> 08:02.567
I just wanted to say that you're the
best girlfriend that a guy could want.

08:02.644 --> 08:03.668
Landry?

08:03.745 --> 08:08.045
I know that you're not my girlfriend
per se, but I love you anyway.

08:08.150 --> 08:10.015
And my mom is
taking my phone away.

08:10.085 --> 08:14.146
Hey, Tyra. Landry's gotta go.
We'll see you this evening, okay?

08:14.223 --> 08:15.690
Bye-bye.

08:15.757 --> 08:17.850
What? Why would you do that?

08:17.926 --> 08:19.291
You will thank me later.

08:20.762 --> 08:23.458
We got a bye week.
We're gonna start working on spread offense.

08:23.532 --> 08:25.693
McNulty's got a hell
of a defense this year.

08:25.801 --> 08:26.927
They're gonna be
sitting on the I

08:27.002 --> 08:29.095
and they're gonna be pounding
Saracen all night long.

08:29.171 --> 08:31.230
I can guaran-damn-tee you,
gentlemen.

08:31.306 --> 08:33.831
We are not gonna repeat
the loss we had last week.

08:34.576 --> 08:36.669
You wanna build it around McCoy.
Didn't say that.

08:36.745 --> 08:39.373
Hey, Crowley, how about Coach asked
us to work on a spread offense,

08:39.448 --> 08:41.881
we work on a spread offense and
we don't ask any questions?

08:41.950 --> 08:43.008
McGILL: We done here,
Coach?

08:43.085 --> 08:44.552
Yeah, Mac. We're done.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.418
Meet between 2:00 and 3:00 in the bullpen,
start hammering out the details.

08:47.489 --> 08:50.287
All right, y'all heard the man.
Y'all get back to work.

08:54.196 --> 08:55.788
You need something?

08:55.864 --> 08:59.732
So we going with McCoy, here, Eric?
Is that what we're doing?

09:01.603 --> 09:03.264
I don't know, Mac.

09:04.139 --> 09:06.835
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

09:11.914 --> 09:15.281
He just disappeared out of
the middle of nowhere, man.

09:16.485 --> 09:19.079
Is she waving at me?
No, she's waving at me. Shut up.

09:19.154 --> 09:20.348
Who is that, man?

09:20.422 --> 09:22.481
Hey. Hey, I was
hoping that was you.

09:22.824 --> 09:24.189
What are you doing?

09:24.293 --> 09:29.321
Oh, nothing. I was driving back
from San Antonio on a work thing.

09:29.398 --> 09:30.490
Is it all right if I stop here?

09:30.566 --> 09:31.692
I don't wanna block anybody.

09:31.767 --> 09:32.961
You're actually
not supposed to.

09:33.035 --> 09:34.502
Okay, well...

09:34.570 --> 09:38.564
Hey, where are you going?
Can I give you a ride home or something?

09:40.476 --> 09:42.376
All right. Yeah, fine.

09:42.679 --> 09:43.839
I'm gonna get a ride.

09:43.913 --> 09:45.210
You sure, man?

09:45.315 --> 09:47.112
All right.
All right.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.423
It's just over there.

09:59.495 --> 10:01.122
Yeah, I remember.

10:03.299 --> 10:06.826
Wow, you got your
own sign. That's kind of cool.

10:08.037 --> 10:11.268
Everybody gets one,
so it's not really a big deal.

10:17.513 --> 10:18.537
Thanks for the ride.

10:18.615 --> 10:20.082
You're welcome.

10:20.149 --> 10:22.140
So I guess I'll see you.

10:23.653 --> 10:25.018
Yeah, okay.

10:29.525 --> 10:30.958
Thank you.

10:31.027 --> 10:32.585
You're welcome.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.701
Hey, Matt! Wait a second.

10:40.970 --> 10:43.996
You know, it seems like you got
a lot on your plate, and...

10:44.073 --> 10:45.404
I guess I was
just wondering if...

10:45.475 --> 10:49.206
I don't know, if there's anything
I could do to help out or...

10:50.346 --> 10:52.109
No. We're good.

10:52.749 --> 10:54.273
Okay. Good, good.

10:55.018 --> 10:57.282
'Cause I was just thinking
that while I'm in town...

10:57.353 --> 10:59.412
How long are you in town for?

10:59.489 --> 11:01.980
Not long-term or anything.
I just...

11:02.392 --> 11:05.555
I just would really love
to help out, that's all.

11:10.299 --> 11:11.960
Okay, look, um...

11:13.770 --> 11:17.433
I'm supposed to take Grandma to an orthopedist
appointment tomorrow afternoon, but...

11:17.540 --> 11:18.529
Oh.

11:18.941 --> 11:21.136
I mean, I got this
really big test the next day.

11:21.210 --> 11:23.178
Yeah. That'd be perfect.

11:23.913 --> 11:25.642
Yeah, I'll take her
to the doctor tomorrow.

11:25.715 --> 11:27.205
At 4:00?

11:28.251 --> 11:30.151
4:00. See you then.

11:38.294 --> 11:41.731
Hey, how's it going?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.228
Let's go. Let's go
have your snack. Grandma.

11:46.303 --> 11:47.930
Come on. Just...

11:50.107 --> 11:51.574
Here we go.

11:55.679 --> 11:57.909
That's disgusting. I don't know.
Here's what you do.

11:57.981 --> 12:00.916
You break it at the joint,
you slide your thumb under it,

12:00.984 --> 12:02.884
and then you just...

12:02.986 --> 12:05.216
Oh, God.

12:05.656 --> 12:07.317
All right.
That's how you do it.

12:07.391 --> 12:10.519
And if you're really cool, here's
what you do with the head.

12:10.594 --> 12:12.323
Yeah, do it, do it.

12:14.164 --> 12:15.188
See, that's just wrong.

12:15.265 --> 12:16.357
Yeah, it's not that good.

12:17.935 --> 12:20.631
See, he's got a lot
of useless skills like that.

12:20.704 --> 12:21.932
You know he speaks French?

12:22.005 --> 12:25.236
I mean, I'm telling you, there's nothing
weirder than seeing some drunk-ass

12:25.309 --> 12:27.004
cowboy speaking French.
Drunk-ass? Come on.

12:27.077 --> 12:28.544
Where did you learn
how to speak French?

12:28.612 --> 12:30.546
Picked it up in Louisiana.

12:30.614 --> 12:31.979
When did you live in Louisiana?

12:32.049 --> 12:35.018
Grew up there and then my family moved
to Dillon when I was in high school,

12:35.085 --> 12:37.315
where I met this
fine, upstanding citizen.

12:37.387 --> 12:38.945
Oh, yeah.
The rest is history.

12:39.022 --> 12:41.354
Seriously, you should've seen this
kid pitch in high school, though.

12:41.425 --> 12:43.825
It was ridiculous.
He had a canon for an arm.

12:43.894 --> 12:46.419
Could have gotten a scholarship to
any school you wanted to go to.

12:46.497 --> 12:48.089
Baseball is too slow
and boring.

12:48.165 --> 12:50.998
Right now, I like to ride
broncs in the rodeo.

12:51.101 --> 12:52.363
Yee-haw.

12:54.004 --> 12:56.564
Yeah, there he is,
Mitch Stallman.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.270
He's in charge of group sales.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.943
I'm gonna work at
Alamo Freeze till I die.

13:05.015 --> 13:08.951
You just gotta trust Coach, Smash.
I mean, he knows what he's doing, so...

13:09.019 --> 13:10.816
Hey, Smash? Matt?

13:10.888 --> 13:14.688
I'm really glad I could provide
you with beverages and Wi-Fi

13:14.758 --> 13:18.455
and all that you can possibly want, but
Tyra's gonna be over here pretty soon.

13:18.529 --> 13:20.326
I thought she broke up
with you a long time ago.

13:20.397 --> 13:21.762
Yeah, she did.

13:21.832 --> 13:24.266
Your facts aren't
quite correct, Smash.

13:24.334 --> 13:25.323
Is that right?

13:25.402 --> 13:29.600
See, Tyra is a complicated woman and
it's a very complicated situation.

13:29.673 --> 13:32.141
Let's get out of here, man.
I'd be worried if she wasn't doing this.

13:32.209 --> 13:35.110
It's getting sad and weird in here,
and I need to keep my mood up.

13:35.179 --> 13:37.170
I heard every bit
of what you just said, man.

13:37.247 --> 13:38.339
Later, Lando.

13:38.415 --> 13:41.282
Hey, if she doesn't show,
you give me a call, okay?

13:41.351 --> 13:43.251
She'll show up, Matt.

13:44.688 --> 13:47.748
We are not going to
San Antonio on our honeymoon.

13:48.258 --> 13:51.194
Why not?
Because you're taking me to Hawaii.

13:51.262 --> 13:52.695
How the hell am I
gonna afford Hawaii?

13:52.764 --> 13:53.788
I don't know.

13:53.865 --> 13:55.389
I mean, we have to
win the lottery.

13:55.466 --> 13:56.455
What's that?

13:56.534 --> 13:59.025
Uh, it's just a little bit
of cowboy candy.

13:59.103 --> 14:01.037
I busted my shoulder
in Mineola last week.

14:01.105 --> 14:02.367
Oh, my God, that's so weird.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.000
Do you remember when I busted my
shoulder last week in Mineola?

14:05.109 --> 14:07.009
No. Nice try, though.

14:14.319 --> 14:19.120
Hey, you wanna get out of
here, leave these guys alone?

14:21.326 --> 14:22.486
Sure.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.585
Yeah? Let's go.
Yeah. Okay.

14:25.196 --> 14:27.460
Well, Billy,
I'll see you later, buddy.

14:27.532 --> 14:28.624
Bye, y'all.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.327
Have a fun time.

14:41.446 --> 14:42.572
What?

14:44.649 --> 14:45.911
What's wrong?

14:46.050 --> 14:47.142
Um...

14:49.053 --> 14:51.783
I'm gonna have to
take a pass on tonight.

14:53.691 --> 14:57.559
My friend Landry, he had his wisdom
teeth pulled today and I told him

14:57.629 --> 14:59.722
I'd go over there and help.

15:00.431 --> 15:04.800
So... Yeah, well, I got a
pretty good idea about that.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.003
What's that?

15:24.455 --> 15:25.547
Okay.

15:26.991 --> 15:28.754
Let's go.
All right.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.089
And then, he's just
going on about how,

15:34.165 --> 15:36.565
"Oh, yeah, I talked all
about it with Paul Dunley,

15:36.634 --> 15:38.864
"I just played golf with him
last weekend.' ' Yeah?"

15:38.937 --> 15:41.633
I mean, how am I supposed to compete with that?
You know what I mean?

15:41.706 --> 15:43.105
I don't play golf.
So they...

15:43.174 --> 15:45.301
You should learn,
it's fun if you bring beer!

15:45.376 --> 15:47.844
I hate golf.
Could we slow down just a little bit?

15:47.912 --> 15:51.143
Yeah, sorry. You know this whole
thing is just a boys' club,

15:51.215 --> 15:52.239
and you know...

15:52.317 --> 15:54.046
Honey, you should've
known that!

15:54.118 --> 15:55.848
Okay, can I tell you something?
Can I tell you something?

15:55.921 --> 15:58.412
And don't be mad at me, 'cause
I didn't invent the world,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.958
but nobody likes
an angry woman.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.586
I am not angry, I am not angry.
That is the thing.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.256
I have dealt with this with such
dignity and they've just been riding

16:06.332 --> 16:07.492
roughshod all over me.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.898
You're angry underneath,
you see?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.164
And that, honey, is just
a waste of your time.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.206
So, look, you gotta make a plan here.
Gotta plan your move.

16:15.274 --> 16:18.175
Yeah. So you don't play golf.
You eat, don't you?

16:18.243 --> 16:19.972
I do.
Okay, here's what you do.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.275
You find out where this guy,
Dunley, has his coffee

16:22.348 --> 16:24.111
and you go there
and you chat him up.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.673
That's a good idea,
kind of stalk him.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.083
And, honey,
wear your hair down.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.619
Wear it down.
Okay.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.189
Hey.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.824
Hey.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.466
I meant to call you.
I am so sorry.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.597
Well, what happened?

16:44.703 --> 16:48.298
I had to be with my mom last night.
She got some bad news.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.705
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Is she okay?

16:51.777 --> 16:54.746
Yeah, it wasn't actually her,
it was my aunt.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.980
Some medical stuff.
It looks like she's gonna be okay, though.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.819
Sorry,
I actually have to get going.

17:01.887 --> 17:05.448
I have to read the entire book of
Julius Caesar in 45 minutes so...

17:05.523 --> 17:07.355
Technically, it's a play.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.718
I'm sorry, Lan.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.259
I'll see you later?

17:18.337 --> 17:20.430
All right, gentlemen,
let's go now, it's Friday.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.029
We got a long weekend
ahead of us.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.165
I'm gonna change it up a little
bit, here's what we're gonna do.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.507
We're gonna rotate snaps
between Saracen and J.D.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.569
Go seven on seven.
Coaches, get them together. Let's go.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.309
I wanna hear some hustle out here today.
Let's hear it right now. Let's go!

18:24.237 --> 18:26.262
Let's see it again, gentlemen.
Hut!

18:28.241 --> 18:29.401
It's not that big
of a deal.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.773
Well, I don't understand it.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.312
You always take me
to my doctor's appointments.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.937
I know, but today is a
little bit different, okay?

18:35.014 --> 18:37.073
Well, I don't like different,

18:37.150 --> 18:39.846
and I don't like her.
And I'm going back in the house.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.443
No, you're not.
Now, let me go!

18:41.521 --> 18:42.647
Please, I've had
a really rough day.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.748
I've got a lot of studying to do and
it's gonna help me out so much if...

18:45.825 --> 18:48.020
If you'd just go with her
to the doctor.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.356
Please.

18:59.205 --> 19:02.333
This is a bad idea...
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

19:09.449 --> 19:13.647
So Katie McCoy thinks that I
should track down Paul Dunley,

19:13.720 --> 19:15.881
like, find him where
he eats or something.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.287
You know, like,
stalk him kind of thing.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.225
But, I don't know, that's not my style.
It feels pushy to me.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.091
But maybe that's
what I need to be doing,

19:23.163 --> 19:25.996
because obviously that's what
everybody else is doing, you know?

19:26.065 --> 19:27.726
It's just so frustrating.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.030
Honey, where are we going?
Honey, what are we doing?

19:30.103 --> 19:31.331
What is going on?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.462
I need a drink.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.370
We got a bottle of wine
in the fridge.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.670
I need
a Scotch-flavored drink.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.779
Let me call Julie.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.576
There is no doubt
that J.D. McCoy,

19:42.649 --> 19:46.016
he wins out when it comes to
physical skills, I understand that.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.447
Hell, he's got the best arm of any high
school quarterback I've ever seen.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.114
That includes Jason Street.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.385
That's saying something,
right there.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.789
But then again, Matt...

19:53.860 --> 19:57.091
Well, Matt's got the experience, he's
got three seasons under his belt,

19:57.163 --> 19:58.323
the team knows
how to play with Matt,

19:58.398 --> 20:01.026
I know what I've got
with Matt Saracen.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.764
That's a hard decision to have.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.566
After everything that kid's
been through,

20:06.639 --> 20:08.163
if I bench him

20:08.841 --> 20:11.140
halfway through
his senior year,

20:11.745 --> 20:12.871
it'd kill him.

20:14.148 --> 20:17.311
But, honey, I mean, this is the stuff
that happens, this is football.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.011
Yes, it is.
And...

20:19.086 --> 20:21.850
It just seems to me you don't
have to have it set in stone.

20:21.922 --> 20:24.686
You could take it one game
at a time, if you want to.

20:24.858 --> 20:29.295
Honey, I don't think you understand.
If I start J.D. McCoy,

20:29.430 --> 20:31.694
the significance of that...
I think I do.

20:31.765 --> 20:34.063
The kid is good,
you gotta understand that.

20:34.168 --> 20:37.399
But he's also a 15-year-old kid
with a freak show of a father.

20:37.471 --> 20:38.870
If I put him out there
on the field,

20:38.939 --> 20:40.804
I don't know if he's gonna
be able to handle it.

20:40.874 --> 20:44.674
The fact of the matter is, it's my
responsibility to that kid to make sure

20:44.745 --> 20:48.112
that he's not pushed too fast
and that he's prepared.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.144
What the hell is so funny?
Honey, oh.

20:53.921 --> 20:54.979
What are you laughing at?

20:55.055 --> 20:56.488
This is what I love about you.

20:56.557 --> 20:58.684
What? That I can't make a
decision to save my damn life?

20:58.759 --> 21:01.387
No, that you're making
a decision with...

21:01.595 --> 21:03.790
With such a conscience and...

21:04.665 --> 21:08.829
What other coach would ever do that?
No less, agonize over it like that.

21:09.136 --> 21:11.661
And, you know, I think it's
'cause you're a teacher first,

21:11.739 --> 21:14.367
and I know
you're gonna say it's corny,

21:14.975 --> 21:17.136
but you are a molder of men.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.470
And I find that admirable.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.813
And I find that sexy.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.148
Let me tell you what, I'll have to
ruminate on that a little bit longer

21:30.224 --> 21:31.816
since you find it so damn sexy.

21:31.892 --> 21:33.018
Okay.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.695
Just go
through the motion.

21:38.899 --> 21:40.366
There you go.

21:40.668 --> 21:42.693
There it is.
Nice and slow.

21:43.037 --> 21:45.665
Watch your foot placement.
Give me another good one.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.730
What do you know, gentlemen?
Hey, Coach.

21:47.808 --> 21:50.208
Hey, Wade.
Good of you to stop by.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.911
Texas quick-fire.
H is in motion, what does X do?

21:55.983 --> 21:58.110
Watch my strong side.
Right.

21:58.185 --> 21:59.174
Uh...

21:59.553 --> 22:01.521
I'm looking corner post left.
What's the read?

22:01.588 --> 22:03.613
Free safety.
What's the life color in the audibles?

22:03.691 --> 22:06.159
Depends. Last week it was blue.
This week, it's red.

22:06.226 --> 22:07.716
You been paying attention
or something?

22:08.729 --> 22:10.026
Yes, sir.

22:10.097 --> 22:12.429
Tell me something
about yourself.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.233
I set goals
and I achieve them, sir.

22:14.301 --> 22:15.928
This isn't a job interview.

22:16.003 --> 22:18.199
I'm asking you, what do you do
when you're not playing football?

22:18.273 --> 22:19.706
Tell me something
about yourself.

22:19.774 --> 22:23.870
I play Madden on my Xbox

22:23.945 --> 22:26.345
or go swimming. Usually, I'm
just practicing or working out.

22:26.448 --> 22:28.541
You know you need to
bulk up some, don't you?

22:28.616 --> 22:31.449
Eat some chicken fried steak
or something.

22:31.820 --> 22:34.118
I'm not allowed to have fried food.
My dad says it's bad for me.

22:34.189 --> 22:35.656
He does, huh?

22:37.025 --> 22:39.323
I'm gonna watch you
throw a few.

22:40.161 --> 22:41.753
Nice and slow.

22:44.299 --> 22:45.766
There you go.

22:49.037 --> 22:50.299
Good job.

22:54.142 --> 22:56.042
Sit anywhere.
Thank you.

23:04.753 --> 23:05.947
Can I get you
something to drink?

23:06.020 --> 23:08.853
I'd love a coffee, thank you.
Okay, great.

23:09.824 --> 23:12.657
Hi, Paul. How you doing?

23:12.727 --> 23:14.251
Principal Taylor!
Nice to see you.

23:14.329 --> 23:15.318
You as well.

23:15.397 --> 23:17.661
Gosh, I don't think I've seen you
since our interview this summer, huh?

23:17.732 --> 23:19.859
I guess it was.
Yeah, that's right.

23:19.934 --> 23:21.492
That's right.
Good, good, good.

23:21.603 --> 23:24.834
Actually, I was just finishing up here.
I have a meeting I need to get to.

23:24.939 --> 23:27.169
I'm looking forward
to our meeting this week.

23:27.242 --> 23:28.470
So am I.
Yeah.

23:28.576 --> 23:31.409
You know, actually, now that I'm running
into you, there are a couple of things

23:31.479 --> 23:33.071
I would just love to
go over with you

23:33.148 --> 23:34.775
in a real casual context.

23:34.849 --> 23:36.612
Like I said,
I have a meeting, Tami.

23:36.684 --> 23:39.949
I'll make it real brief.
I just wanna make sure you had all the information

23:40.021 --> 23:42.546
in terms of what this
JumboTron money could get us.

23:42.624 --> 23:44.888
It could actually get us two,
maybe three of the teachers

23:44.959 --> 23:46.153
that we've lost
since the lay-off.

23:46.227 --> 23:49.526
Principal Taylor, this really isn't
the proper time. Right, right.

23:49.597 --> 23:52.828
But I know that you've been talking
about it to Garrity on the golf course

23:52.901 --> 23:54.562
and things like that.

23:54.636 --> 23:58.766
And so I just wanna make sure that
it's gonna be a fair conversation.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.603
There's no reason
to get angry about this, Tami.

24:00.675 --> 24:05.169
No, I'm not angry. I'm just dealing
with a school that's understaffed.

24:05.246 --> 24:07.180
When I think about it
that way, it makes me angry.

24:07.248 --> 24:09.739
I mean, I'm not angry now,
but it's angering.

24:09.818 --> 24:11.718
Look, Tami, you know,

24:11.886 --> 24:15.515
I want more teachers, too.
And more supplies.

24:16.024 --> 24:19.221
But those people gave their
money for a JumboTron.

24:19.894 --> 24:22.692
Look, I'll see you next week.
I'm real interested to hear what you have to say.

24:22.764 --> 24:24.699
Okay, bye-bye now.
Okay.

24:25.367 --> 24:27.301
It's not a big deal.

24:27.369 --> 24:29.269
You haven't seen your mom
since you were a little kid.

24:29.338 --> 24:31.738
I think that qualifies
as a big deal.

24:32.408 --> 24:34.808
How did you feel
when you saw her?

24:34.877 --> 24:36.970
I don't know, man.
It was...

24:38.080 --> 24:39.479
It was weird.

24:39.548 --> 24:41.573
Are y'all gonna see
each other again?

24:41.650 --> 24:45.848
Why are you so obsessed with my mother?
How's your mother? Is your mother doing fine?

24:45.921 --> 24:47.718
Hi, it's nice to see you.

24:47.790 --> 24:48.814
Hi.

24:49.925 --> 24:52.223
So, are you ready
for Hadley's midterm?

24:52.328 --> 24:54.728
No. Someone won't
let me study.

24:54.997 --> 24:57.192
I know. My mom is kind
of really obsessed about it.

24:57.266 --> 24:58.961
She's determined that
if I don't pass it,

24:59.034 --> 25:01.195
then my entire future
is, like, corroded.

25:01.270 --> 25:04.330
So do you maybe wanna...

25:13.315 --> 25:15.078
Hi, Landry. Um...

25:16.085 --> 25:17.643
Cash, this is Landry.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.347
Yeah, Landry. I'm Cash.

25:19.421 --> 25:21.446
Yeah, I know who you are.

25:23.826 --> 25:24.918
Um...

25:26.495 --> 25:28.986
We're gonna have a little
conversation, first, okay?

25:29.064 --> 25:30.190
You all right?
She's fine.

25:30.266 --> 25:32.632
Yeah, it'll be, like, two minutes.
Thank you.

25:36.338 --> 25:40.536
I'm really starting
to think that by "aunt,"

25:41.777 --> 25:44.769
you actually meant
Cash the rodeo guy.

25:45.147 --> 25:48.844
Is that... I'm starting to kind
of piece all this together, Tyra.

25:48.918 --> 25:50.977
Landry, I'm sorry I lied to you.
You did lie to me.

25:51.053 --> 25:52.884
You lied right to my face.

25:52.955 --> 25:55.788
I believed you about your aunt.
I felt bad for you.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.553
I didn't wanna hurt you.

25:57.626 --> 26:01.756
God, I have been really, really stupid
for a really, really long time.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.457
We broke up, like,
two months ago.

26:03.532 --> 26:06.023
Tell me what's changed
since we broke up?

26:06.101 --> 26:08.763
You still...
You still hold my hand.

26:08.971 --> 26:12.134
I held your hand at Cloverfield.
It was a scary movie.

26:12.207 --> 26:13.299
You say that
I'm your best friend.

26:13.375 --> 26:14.603
Maybe I should've been
clearer from the beginning.

26:14.677 --> 26:16.235
We're not together.

26:16.312 --> 26:20.078
If you want to choose
a guy that rides horses...

26:20.149 --> 26:22.083
Yes, he rides horses!
...and he drives a truck...

26:22.151 --> 26:23.175
And he drives a truck!

26:23.252 --> 26:24.514
And wears a big,
stupid cowboy hat,

26:24.587 --> 26:25.884
then you just tell it
to my face!

26:25.955 --> 26:28.150
Really?
Yes, I'm choosing him!

26:32.462 --> 26:34.987
All right.
Well, thank you very much.

26:40.470 --> 26:41.698
What are you doing over there?

26:41.771 --> 26:44.433
I'm doing problem number two.

26:44.507 --> 26:45.735
I think.

26:50.780 --> 26:52.270
Hey, surprise!

26:53.750 --> 26:54.978
What are you doing?

26:55.051 --> 26:58.418
Well, I was at H-E-B and I saw a few
things I thought you might like.

26:58.488 --> 27:00.353
Vanilla creams, right?

27:00.657 --> 27:02.557
I'll be in my bedroom.

27:02.759 --> 27:04.283
Here. Thanks.

27:05.061 --> 27:06.323
Grandma?

27:07.631 --> 27:09.223
This... This is Julie.

27:09.299 --> 27:11.631
Hi, Julie, I'm Shelby,
Matt's...

27:11.701 --> 27:13.032
My mom.

27:14.804 --> 27:16.999
Hi, I'm Julie.
It's really nice to meet you.

27:17.073 --> 27:18.563
It's nice to meet you, Julie.

27:18.642 --> 27:21.634
I found a few of Matt's
baby pictures and I...

27:22.512 --> 27:24.139
I thought, maybe Lorraine
might like to see them.

27:24.214 --> 27:25.977
That's really cool.
Can I see them?

27:26.049 --> 27:28.540
Oh, yeah.
You can't do this.

27:29.519 --> 27:32.113
Do what?
You can't come in here

27:32.188 --> 27:36.284
with groceries and baby pictures
and act like everything is normal.

27:39.195 --> 27:42.460
I know I can't just...
I don't need your help, okay?

27:43.333 --> 27:46.359
I needed it 10 years ago, when you left.
And five years ago.

27:46.436 --> 27:49.428
But I don't need it anymore.
I figured it out.

27:49.973 --> 27:51.133
So...

27:51.307 --> 27:53.639
Thank you for taking
my grandmother to the doctor.

27:53.710 --> 27:56.440
You wanted to help
and you helped, now...

27:58.648 --> 28:00.240
Please, go home.

28:03.687 --> 28:04.915
Sweetheart, I didn't mean to...

28:04.988 --> 28:06.683
Don't call me that.

28:47.031 --> 28:50.125
I'm an idiot.
Honey, no.

28:50.201 --> 28:52.829
I should never have
picked this fight.

28:53.537 --> 28:55.835
Yes, babe.
You should have.

28:55.906 --> 28:59.034
Oh, honey, you don't even
mean that, I don't think.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.975
I think you thought it was
a bad idea the whole time.

29:01.045 --> 29:03.479
That's not true.
I never said that.

29:03.681 --> 29:05.171
That's not what I thought.

29:05.249 --> 29:08.184
I think it's obvious that you're
right and they're wrong. Period.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.718
Really? You're damn right.
You think we need a JumboTron?

29:12.790 --> 29:14.189
We don't need a JumboTron.

29:14.258 --> 29:15.452
Of course we don't
need a JumboTron.

29:15.526 --> 29:18.359
We need more teachers.
Of course we do.

29:18.429 --> 29:19.487
You're right.
They're wrong.

29:19.563 --> 29:20.791
Mmm-hmm.

29:22.299 --> 29:25.200
It doesn't matter, though,
'cause I'm gonna lose tomorrow.

29:25.269 --> 29:26.634
Okay, yeah.

29:27.438 --> 29:31.431
They're gonna get the JumboTron.
In that sense, you lose tomorrow.

29:31.976 --> 29:34.376
But you stood up
for what you believed in.

29:34.445 --> 29:36.777
In that sense,
you win tomorrow.

29:41.619 --> 29:42.608
Hey.

29:44.088 --> 29:46.056
You can at least make them
feel a little guilty

29:46.123 --> 29:48.648
about that big old
stupid JumboTron.

29:51.862 --> 29:53.557
Thank you, honey.

29:59.170 --> 30:00.865
Look, Grandma...

30:02.907 --> 30:06.070
I'm sorry that I had her drive
you to the doctor the other day.

30:06.177 --> 30:09.738
Oh, honey. It seemed like a
good idea at the time, and...

30:11.215 --> 30:13.183
It turned out not to be.

30:14.351 --> 30:15.841
So I'm sorry.

30:17.755 --> 30:18.881
Well, now...

30:18.956 --> 30:23.290
This doesn't mean I forgive her for what
she did and I still don't like her,

30:23.360 --> 30:25.294
but your daddy, he's...

30:26.463 --> 30:28.863
He's very difficult.
We know that.

30:29.967 --> 30:31.901
And, you know, maybe...

30:32.369 --> 30:33.529
Shoot.

30:34.104 --> 30:36.402
Maybe I could've helped her out

30:36.807 --> 30:38.934
a little bit more than I did.

30:40.110 --> 30:41.304
What do you mean?

30:41.378 --> 30:44.973
Oh, I just mean what I said.
And that's it.

30:45.049 --> 30:47.985
Let's not have a
big old soap opera about it.

30:49.855 --> 30:51.117
Let's go watch some TV.

30:51.189 --> 30:52.588
All right.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.720
Got your mouthpiece and cleats?

30:56.795 --> 30:57.955
Yeah.

30:59.598 --> 31:02.362
You gotta remember there's
gonna be a different cadence.

31:02.434 --> 31:04.129
Gotta listen to the snap count.
I got it, Coach!

31:04.202 --> 31:05.362
Pay attention
to the snap count.

31:05.437 --> 31:07.905
Just saying
you just gotta listen.

31:09.941 --> 31:12.307
So Mitch Stallman,

31:12.377 --> 31:14.675
he's a front-office guy?

31:18.250 --> 31:19.740
Yes, he is.

31:34.733 --> 31:36.166
Hi.
Hi.

31:37.202 --> 31:39.102
I'm glad you called me.

31:41.006 --> 31:42.303
How did you find me?

31:42.407 --> 31:45.274
There's only two motels
in town, so...

31:48.813 --> 31:50.280
Get you something?

31:50.415 --> 31:53.350
Can I just get some water, please?
Thank you.

31:53.585 --> 31:54.779
Thanks.

31:58.490 --> 32:00.685
Look, I know my dad is a jerk.

32:01.393 --> 32:02.860
I mean, I've lived with him,

32:02.928 --> 32:06.591
I know how he yells
and throws stuff.

32:10.035 --> 32:12.162
I guess that's why you left.

32:13.638 --> 32:17.096
I'm not gonna say anything bad
about your dad, Matthew.

32:17.275 --> 32:20.904
I mean, I was 17
when I got pregnant.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.805
I had only known him
a couple months.

32:25.083 --> 32:26.710
I was just a kid.

32:27.218 --> 32:28.981
But I will never...

32:29.621 --> 32:32.419
Never ever forgive myself
for leaving you.

32:33.358 --> 32:36.885
And God knows I don't expect
you to forgive me, either.

32:38.530 --> 32:40.498
Well, what do you want?

32:40.966 --> 32:42.228
I mean...

32:43.668 --> 32:45.329
Why are you here?

32:48.173 --> 32:52.007
When you showed up at my door
with that paper from that lawyer,

32:53.279 --> 32:55.372
and I found out
that your dad's in Iraq

32:55.448 --> 32:58.940
and you're taking care of
Lorraine all by yourself, I...

33:00.119 --> 33:01.746
I just thought...

33:02.989 --> 33:05.150
You're all alone in this.

33:05.891 --> 33:07.381
It's too much.

33:08.394 --> 33:11.090
I just felt like a deep...

33:12.965 --> 33:14.557
I just felt bad.

33:15.234 --> 33:17.668
And I'm not looking for you
to forgive me,

33:17.737 --> 33:20.365
I'm not looking for you
to call me Mom,

33:20.806 --> 33:23.798
but I just really would love
to stick around for a while,

33:23.909 --> 33:25.706
a few weeks or so,

33:26.979 --> 33:29.345
just to see
if I can lend a hand.

33:37.356 --> 33:38.687
All right.

33:41.660 --> 33:42.957
Great.

33:45.531 --> 33:46.691
Thank you.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.463
That's really great.

33:56.942 --> 33:58.204
Stand up.

34:00.346 --> 34:03.975
We've been here an hour.
How much longer are we gonna have to wait?

34:08.020 --> 34:09.009
Hey.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.348
Mitch, how you doing?
Doing great, Coach. How are you?

34:11.424 --> 34:12.447
Good, good.
Good to see you.

34:12.525 --> 34:15.050
Okay. So everything's good.
Good.

34:15.127 --> 34:17.254
I talked to Coach Helling,

34:17.329 --> 34:20.389
but the deal is we're
gonna have to reschedule.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.960
You gotta be kidding me.

34:22.034 --> 34:23.661
I am sorry, fellows, but...

34:23.735 --> 34:26.670
This whole Thursday night game's
got the schedule all screwed up.

34:26.739 --> 34:30.072
But he said we can do it next
weekend, if you guys are available.

34:30.141 --> 34:31.130
Next weekend?

34:31.210 --> 34:32.472
Yes, sir.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.338
Is that gonna work for you?

34:39.018 --> 34:40.349
Follow me.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.520
Hey, Vince!

34:44.489 --> 34:45.786
What the hell are you doing?

34:45.858 --> 34:47.792
Coach, I know you got practice,

34:47.860 --> 34:51.159
and I respect that.
But I have got to tell you something.

34:51.230 --> 34:53.357
This kid right here
can flat-out play.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.626
He's fast, he's tough as hell,

34:54.699 --> 34:56.690
and he can read the field better
than any player you got out here.

34:56.768 --> 34:59.203
I guarantee you, and let me
tell you something else.

34:59.272 --> 35:02.036
He's got more heart and guts
than any kid I've ever coached.

35:02.109 --> 35:04.441
You know what
I'm talking about.

35:04.878 --> 35:07.904
You just ask yourself whether you wanna
be the one who passed up on the chance.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.040
Take a look at Brian Williams,
'cause I'm telling you what,

35:10.150 --> 35:11.549
we drove a hell of a long way
to get down here,

35:11.618 --> 35:13.381
and I don't know
when we're gonna get back.

35:13.453 --> 35:15.080
Let me ask you something,
Coach.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.146
If someone pulled a stunt like
this while you were over at TMU,

35:17.224 --> 35:19.192
what do you think Coach
Boyd would have done, huh?

35:19.259 --> 35:20.886
Well, he would have said,
"There's a guy with balls

35:20.961 --> 35:23.486
"and the courage
of his convictions.' '"

35:23.563 --> 35:24.928
Then he would have
looked me in the eye and said,

35:24.998 --> 35:27.125
"Get the hell off my field.' '"

35:28.568 --> 35:30.536
You won't be disappointed.

35:35.809 --> 35:37.777
First unit, take a knee.

35:38.612 --> 35:39.636
You listen to me.

35:39.713 --> 35:42.910
You listen to me closer than
you've ever listened to me before.

35:42.983 --> 35:45.213
You remember that Rutledge
game, fourth quarter?

35:45.318 --> 35:47.377
You came into that game,
you took over that game.

35:47.454 --> 35:50.048
Play by play,
you owned that game.

35:50.490 --> 35:52.458
I watched you that day,
and I said to myself,

35:52.526 --> 35:54.426
"That kid is gonna
go all the way.' '"

35:55.795 --> 35:57.626
Right now, right here,

35:57.697 --> 36:00.530
God has placed you to do
what you do best.

36:03.970 --> 36:05.699
Go all the way.

36:07.307 --> 36:08.865
Ten, nine, hut!

36:54.454 --> 36:56.615
Which knee did he bust up?
I couldn't tell.

36:56.690 --> 36:57.918
Exactly.

37:02.195 --> 37:04.186
What do you think, Coach?

37:04.998 --> 37:07.991
I wouldn't go busting
out the bubbly just yet.

37:09.370 --> 37:10.928
We'll call you.

37:20.014 --> 37:22.209
McGILL: You're good with this?

37:22.283 --> 37:23.978
You ready to
install this thing?

37:24.051 --> 37:25.780
McGILL: We're ready, Coach.

37:25.853 --> 37:27.320
Send them in.

37:29.523 --> 37:30.615
Hey.

37:30.691 --> 37:32.249
Get in here.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.685
All right,
let's go, fellows.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.898
We're gonna shake things up
on Friday night.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.957
Matt, you're gonna start.

37:41.168 --> 37:43.534
You're also gonna play,
we're gonna rotate series.

37:43.604 --> 37:46.698
You're getting equal time
out there. Understood?

37:47.341 --> 37:48.365
Yeah.

37:48.442 --> 37:49.636
This is my decision.

37:49.710 --> 37:52.645
I'm making this decision, 'cause I
think it's gonna help us win the game.

37:52.713 --> 37:55.648
Matt, when you're out there, we're
gonna run the I, J.D. the spread.

37:55.716 --> 37:57.343
Is that understood?

37:57.418 --> 37:58.544
Yeah.

37:58.619 --> 38:01.554
It's unorthodox, the way we
like things around here.

38:01.622 --> 38:03.590
But it's not gonna work
if McNulty knows about it.

38:03.658 --> 38:07.856
So y'all are gonna have to ride herd
over the team. Is that understood?

38:09.030 --> 38:10.054
Yes, sir.

38:10.131 --> 38:14.295
It's gonna be a long, hard week of practice.
You bring your A games.

38:17.405 --> 38:19.134
See you out there.

38:26.180 --> 38:29.240
First, we want to thank the boosters,
the wives and all their supporters

38:29.350 --> 38:30.908
for all their time and efforts.

38:30.985 --> 38:33.852
And I would now like to bring
up Principal Tami Taylor

38:33.921 --> 38:35.479
for our final introduction.

38:35.556 --> 38:36.887
Mrs. Taylor.

38:39.860 --> 38:42.658
Hi, y'all.
Thank you.

38:45.733 --> 38:48.668
Well, Dillon Panthers fans,
I got two words for you.

38:48.736 --> 38:50.101
JumboTron.

38:55.109 --> 38:57.839
Of course, I know
that's really only one word,

38:57.912 --> 39:00.972
but I wanted to quote our friend
Buddy Garrity, over there.

39:01.082 --> 39:03.949
It's because of him that we
have all this excitement today.

39:05.986 --> 39:08.454
I would also like to
thank Buddy Garrity

39:08.522 --> 39:12.356
for his generous offer
to host the PTA's

39:12.426 --> 39:15.157
winter silent auction
at Garrity Motors.

39:18.867 --> 39:21.563
So y'all keep your
eyes out for that!

39:30.579 --> 39:31.739
Hello?

39:34.516 --> 39:36.507
Yes, sir, this is Brian.

39:38.286 --> 39:39.548
Uh-huh.

39:41.323 --> 39:42.984
Uh-huh. Yes, sir.

39:43.625 --> 39:46.253
Tomorrow morning?
Yeah, I'll be there.

39:48.630 --> 39:51.531
It's my new shoulder pads.
Gonna be ready in the morning.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.364
Lord, you know
what I thought that was.

39:54.469 --> 39:56.334
I've been holding my breath.

39:56.405 --> 39:58.202
No, I'm just playing.

40:01.042 --> 40:02.373
I got in.

40:03.311 --> 40:05.541
What did you just say, Brian?

40:06.114 --> 40:08.139
I'm going to college, Mom.

40:09.584 --> 40:11.745
Brian, baby.

40:14.956 --> 40:16.355
Oh, my God!

40:18.627 --> 40:19.616
Oh, my God.

40:20.595 --> 40:23.530
He got in!
Your brother's going to college!

40:33.675 --> 40:35.472
Coach Helling called.

40:37.379 --> 40:38.573
I'm in.

40:41.883 --> 40:42.907
Is that right?

40:42.984 --> 40:44.884
He wants me to practice
in the morning.

40:44.953 --> 40:47.945
I'm leaving tonight,
the guys are driving me.

40:48.023 --> 40:50.890
I just figured I'd stop by,
before I left.

40:52.894 --> 40:54.521
Got your playbook?

40:54.596 --> 40:55.688
It's in the car.

40:55.764 --> 40:57.891
Remember what I told you about those
dorm rooms down there, right?

40:57.966 --> 40:59.456
The lake dorm is nothing but trouble.
Yes, sir.

40:59.534 --> 41:01.001
You better not be
skipping any classes.

41:01.069 --> 41:02.866
Better keep your grades up.
I'm gonna be keeping an eye on it.

41:02.938 --> 41:06.567
I'm gonna be keeping an eye on you.
Coach, just hold on.

41:07.142 --> 41:10.634
I wanted to stop by
and say thank you.

41:12.914 --> 41:16.577
You know, for everything.

41:19.387 --> 41:22.323
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

41:23.159 --> 41:24.922
And that's for real.

41:38.841 --> 41:41.674
Hit the bend, baby.
Hit the bend, huh? You got it.

41:42.545 --> 41:46.345
I want some OU tickets, 50-yard
line and some parking passes.

41:46.415 --> 41:48.542
You got it!
One more stop to make, Williams.

41:48.618 --> 41:51.246
Oh, no beer runs, Rigg.
I'm way ahead of you.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.412
What?

41:58.394 --> 42:00.191
Hey, y'all,
first 5 yards.

42:00.263 --> 42:01.787
Don't forget!

42:01.864 --> 42:03.297
All right. Ready?

42:03.466 --> 42:05.525
All right, shove.
Hey, shove, shotgun!

42:05.601 --> 42:06.625
I don't want you cheating.

42:06.702 --> 42:08.169
Set, hike.

42:08.671 --> 42:12.038
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi, game over!

42:13.109 --> 42:14.337
All right!

42:19.682 --> 42:21.343
Where you at, baby?

42:23.953 --> 42:25.420
Where you at?

42:26.305 --> 42:32.900
