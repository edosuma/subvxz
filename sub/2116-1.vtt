00:34.367 --> 00:38.171
<i>Prophecies speak of a savior,</i>

00:38.172 --> 00:40.240
<i>a deity born of man,</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:45.343
<i>whose fate is to wield
the heavenly sword.</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:12.272
<i>It is said that a free people</i>

01:12.273 --> 01:15.375
<i>will always choose peace over war.</i>

01:15.376 --> 01:19.712
<i>My people have never
had that choice.</i>

01:19.713 --> 01:22.615
<i>They called him the raven lord.</i>

01:22.616 --> 01:27.353
<i>Some say he was mortal.
A warlord thirsty for power.</i>

01:27.354 --> 01:30.790
<i>But I swear he rose from hell</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:32.926
<i>to scorch the world with hatred.</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:38.031
<i>All humanity would
disappear like smoke.</i>

01:38.032 --> 01:43.369
<i>But when all was lost, their
salvation, their hope,</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:46.606
<i>came from the heavens.</i>

01:46.607 --> 01:48.608
<i>A warrior...</i>

01:48.609 --> 01:53.112
<i>Mighty enough to challenge
even the raven lord.</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:59.184
<i>And shining through the horror,
a weapon like no other.</i>

02:01.721 --> 02:03.790
<i>When the battle ended,</i>

02:03.791 --> 02:06.859
<i>the heavenly warrior had vanished,</i>

02:06.860 --> 02:10.061
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

02:13.066 --> 02:19.871
<i>And so was born the legend
of our heavenly sword.</i>

02:22.342 --> 02:25.345
<i>Men tore each other's flesh apart</i>

02:25.346 --> 02:28.982
<i>to wield the sword's
unearthly power.</i>

02:28.983 --> 02:32.885
<i>This sword, once a
blessing upon mankind,</i>

02:32.886 --> 02:36.656
<i>had become its curse.</i>

02:36.657 --> 02:39.158
<i>So began the story of our clan,</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:41.794
<i>a family of nomadic warriors</i>

02:41.795 --> 02:46.799
<i>dutifully charged as sole
custodians of the sword,</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:51.469
<i>to save man from
destroying himself.</i>

03:05.118 --> 03:07.620
Be wary, clan brothers,

03:07.621 --> 03:11.389
the green witch is known
for her trickery.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.238
Leave Kai alone.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.106
You think you can stop us?

03:27.107 --> 03:29.874
I only need to stop you, Kyo.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.180
These fools think you're special.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.582
Our special failure!

03:36.583 --> 03:39.886
The great war will come,
and we will fall...

03:39.887 --> 03:42.588
Because of you, Nariko!

03:42.589 --> 03:47.026
The prophet said a savior
was coming, and we got you!

03:47.027 --> 03:50.862
You're a curse upon the clan.

03:57.837 --> 04:01.874
If I'm a curse, then you're
a fool to make me angry.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.543
Apologize to Kai.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.813
I don't apologize to orphans.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.648
She's not even a
member of the clan.

04:09.649 --> 04:11.751
She's nothing but a pet.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.252
I'm waiting.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.321
O-okay, I...

04:15.322 --> 04:18.124
- What is all of this?
- Prophet Takashi, she's mad!

04:18.125 --> 04:20.125
She attacked us for no reason!

04:20.127 --> 04:22.862
It was them. They attacked Kai.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.331
He had a dagger.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.333
What dagger?

04:27.334 --> 04:29.902
There. Itsuki has it.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.771
Let go of me!

04:31.772 --> 04:33.172
Nariko!

04:33.173 --> 04:35.141
Father?

04:35.142 --> 04:37.944
How dare you speak to your
elder in such a fashion?

04:37.945 --> 04:40.613
Prophet Takashi, tell him.
You saw. You know I'm telling...

04:40.614 --> 04:43.850
Enough! You try my patience.

04:43.851 --> 04:47.286
You are forbidden from mixing
with the warrior caste.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.054
- But all I...
- Go!

04:51.324 --> 04:56.262
<i>My loving father. I was his
great and only failure.</i>

04:56.263 --> 04:58.564
<i>His living shame.</i>

04:58.565 --> 05:02.901
<i>Kyo was right. I had cursed him.</i>

05:07.607 --> 05:12.311
Imagine if you actually
allowed her to train.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.647
Perhaps she isn't the failure

05:14.648 --> 05:19.117
you have always
condemned her of being.

05:20.353 --> 05:24.090
Nevertheless, she is
not the chosen one.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.292
Nor is she a kitten.

05:48.914 --> 05:51.417
Get in line, Kyo. You can be next.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.885
Oh, aren't you funny.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.788
You try too hard to be the
son your father wanted.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.889
So do you.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.092
Kai, stop it.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.061
We do not kill our clansmen.

06:02.062 --> 06:06.098
Kai won't kill. Just
make some blood.

06:06.099 --> 06:10.036
I believe her. Come on.
We should be training.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.250
To arms! To arms!

06:27.520 --> 06:30.355
Quickly! Get inside!

06:30.523 --> 06:32.091
Kai, we should...

06:32.092 --> 06:35.393
Kai? Where are you?

08:10.656 --> 08:12.592
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.994
After everything I...
why did you...

08:14.995 --> 08:19.865
No matter who we are or what
we do, this clan is my family.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.069
And family protects its own.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.536
Always.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.243
Lower your sword, daughter.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.544
Come with me.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.602
<i>King Bohan.</i>

08:56.603 --> 09:02.208
<i>He was a boy of great destiny,
taught to lead and to win.</i>

09:02.209 --> 09:06.711
<i>Bohan was to emerge as
the finest of kings.</i>

09:07.713 --> 09:11.817
<i>He was trained to
fight with dignity.</i>

09:11.818 --> 09:16.687
<i>But honor and goodness,
he did not possess.</i>

09:21.427 --> 09:25.931
<i>Scarred with defeat, his
black heart brooded.</i>

09:25.932 --> 09:28.934
<i>He dreamed of a glorious future,</i>

09:28.935 --> 09:32.004
<i>but those secret hopes
were swiped away</i>

09:32.005 --> 09:35.306
<i>with violence and contempt.</i>

09:35.608 --> 09:38.843
<i>He vowed revenge.</i>

09:43.215 --> 09:45.518
<i>And this much he knew:</i>

09:45.519 --> 09:48.886
<i>His time would come.</i>

09:49.989 --> 09:55.793
<i>Bohan was as malevolent and
vicious then as he is now.</i>

09:57.263 --> 10:01.332
<i>Even as a child, he
thirsted for power.</i>

10:06.839 --> 10:13.211
<i>But the crown wasn't enough to
appease his appetite and rage.</i>

10:15.147 --> 10:17.116
<i>A king?</i>

10:17.117 --> 10:20.753
<i>Bohan wanted to become a God.</i>

10:20.754 --> 10:25.656
<i>And for that he needed
our heavenly sword.</i>

10:41.306 --> 10:44.643
Yes, daddy. I'll get
steady this time.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.479
Those of you within the fortress,

10:46.480 --> 10:50.249
bring me this heavenly sword
you hold so precious,

10:50.250 --> 10:55.253
and I swear to you no
one will be hurt or killed.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.859
You will be rewarded
for your sacrifice.

10:59.860 --> 11:04.128
How could he know? How
could that monster know?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.669
Turn those walls to rubble.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.803
As you wish, sire.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.219
Take the sword, Nariko.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.088
It is yours to protect now.

12:36.089 --> 12:40.326
Our walls cannot withstand
such bombardment.

12:40.327 --> 12:43.896
And Bohan must never be
allowed to possess the sword.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.099
Me? You give this task to me?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.802
You defeated Bohan's
assassins today.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.072
Your skill surpasses the
best of my clansmen.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.141
It's true you are no
heavenly warrior,

12:56.142 --> 13:00.379
but as Takashi said,
clearly you are no kitten.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.049
Take the sword, Nariko.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.285
Keep your ego in check.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.288
Remember your chores,
your challenges.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.258
I will lead our people east.
Bohan will follow.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.794
You, Nariko, will
take the sword west.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.664
Father, no. They'll destroy you.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.799
You cannot outrun an army.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.169
But you can, and you will.

13:28.474 --> 13:33.110
Their attention will be on us.
That will be your moment.

13:36.849 --> 13:40.618
Kai, come.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.790
Kai will keep you safe.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.793
No, Kai, I have to stay.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.595
- Come, Kai!
- But...

13:49.596 --> 13:53.431
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me, please!

14:07.913 --> 14:11.115
Oh, no.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.612
Over there!

15:12.645 --> 15:14.480
Well done, Nariko.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.216
How do you... how do
you know my name?

15:17.217 --> 15:20.419
I am king. Now hand it over.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.588
- I don't know what you're...
- Now!

15:22.589 --> 15:26.158
Or I'll make you beg
for your own death.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.629
Do you want to suffer as
your father suffered?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.631
As your sister suffered?

15:32.632 --> 15:36.168
- I don't have a sister.
- You did.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.871
That little paint-faced idiot.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.572
Kai.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.642
You didn't know she
was your sister?

15:43.643 --> 15:45.044
Naive little girl!

15:45.045 --> 15:49.381
Nariko, you were firstborn daughter
in the year of the Firehorse.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.617
But that was only month one.

15:51.618 --> 15:55.754
Your father, the reckless
fool, had plenty of time.

15:55.755 --> 15:59.591
You know about his disappearance
the night of your birth?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.060
Vanished for months.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.729
Everyone thought he'd
done himself in.

16:03.730 --> 16:08.267
He went forth spreading his
useless seed throughout the land,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.602
infecting women like a virus,

16:10.603 --> 16:16.307
so desperate to correct
his mistake: You.

16:19.512 --> 16:24.083
By December, your sister Kai
was born, another failure.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.217
Absolute runt of the litter.

16:28.153 --> 16:32.524
But here is the glorious irony.

16:32.525 --> 16:36.495
Something your dear
father never even knew.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.833
On the 23rd day of the
12th and very last month,

16:40.834 --> 16:44.536
your father had a son.

16:44.537 --> 16:50.142
From the womb of one of the
many women he took by force.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.711
Yes, against their will.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.314
But hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.883
She gave birth, faked
her own death,

16:57.884 --> 17:01.753
and fled to the high country,
a fishing village in the north,

17:01.754 --> 17:06.023
where now, this so-called
chosen one, your brother,

17:06.025 --> 17:10.162
is a dirty common blacksmith.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.763
You are a monster, Bohan.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.633
You are the king of lies.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.601
And while I don't believe anyone...

17:16.602 --> 17:20.239
let alone the bastard son
of Shen can bring me harm,

17:20.240 --> 17:23.407
legend claims that the one
thing that can stop me

17:23.409 --> 17:29.079
is the weapon on your back
in the chosen one's hands.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.154
So you see, both must be destroyed.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.289
It's over, Nariko.

17:37.290 --> 17:42.794
Your family, your clan,
your home all gone!

17:42.795 --> 17:44.796
Nothing left to fight for.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.965
So let us be done with it.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.369
Drop the sword.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.274
Yes.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.610
Now put it down...

17:58.611 --> 18:01.945
and back away.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.460
Don't be a fool.

18:15.461 --> 18:20.632
Even your father knew
that thing is cursed.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.201
Why should I care?

18:22.202 --> 18:25.469
You've left me with
nothing to live for.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.878
So much for the easy way.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.079
Kill her!

18:35.647 --> 18:39.318
<i>In that moment, Nariko
sealed her fate.</i>

18:39.319 --> 18:41.954
<i>All she saw was her fatal mistake:</i>

18:41.955 --> 18:45.390
<i>Delivering the sword to Bohan,</i>

18:45.391 --> 18:49.628
<i>to the very evil it
was meant to defeat.</i>

18:49.629 --> 18:51.797
<i>And as her death drew near,</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:57.334
<i>she new that he must never
hold the heavenly sword.</i>

18:57.970 --> 19:00.771
<i>No matter the cost.</i>

19:03.542 --> 19:05.909
No!

19:08.380 --> 19:10.849
<i>And just as it was written,</i>

19:10.850 --> 19:14.419
<i>as the year of the Firehorse began,</i>

19:14.420 --> 19:19.958
<i>our clan prepared for
this most fateful birth.</i>

19:19.959 --> 19:21.860
<i>Our leader master Shen</i>

19:21.861 --> 19:25.597
<i>stood by his wife during
this torturous labor,</i>

19:25.598 --> 19:30.969
<i>anxiously awaiting the arrival
of his magnificent child.</i>

19:30.970 --> 19:34.072
<i>But something was wrong,</i>

19:34.073 --> 19:39.444
<i>simply because no one
expected that firstborn son</i>

19:39.445 --> 19:41.213
<i>to be a daughter.</i>

19:41.214 --> 19:45.050
<i>Nariko was to live and
grow, but in the shadows,</i>

19:45.051 --> 19:48.086
<i>away from her father's
love and attention.</i>

19:48.087 --> 19:50.722
<i>How could he know through
those lonely years</i>

19:50.723 --> 19:53.558
<i>that I, his trusted friend,</i>

19:53.559 --> 19:58.862
<i>was silently creating
a warrior of my own?</i>

19:59.998 --> 20:02.301
<i>And for that,</i>

20:02.302 --> 20:05.470
<i>even in the shadow of death,</i>

20:05.471 --> 20:10.340
<i>our people will always have hope.</i>

20:50.182 --> 20:52.117
Nariko cold.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.451
Kai!

20:58.457 --> 20:59.991
Fished you out of the river.

20:59.992 --> 21:04.262
You and... and that.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.530
Kai, how did you...

21:05.531 --> 21:09.601
Nariko used the sword. Sword bad.

21:09.602 --> 21:13.905
I did what I had to, Kai.
But how did you survive?

21:13.906 --> 21:15.574
How did you find me?

21:15.575 --> 21:17.576
Kai loves Nariko.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.778
I saw you on the cliff.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.047
You jumped!

21:22.048 --> 21:24.249
You followed me?

21:24.250 --> 21:26.485
You left the clan before Bohan...

21:26.486 --> 21:31.289
I had to come. Kai
will protect Nariko.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.692
I'm glad you're here.

21:33.693 --> 21:37.996
Master Shen, he's Kai's daddy.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.031
You heard Bohan?

21:40.032 --> 21:45.203
Yes, but mama already told Kai.

21:45.204 --> 21:48.472
Not Kai's secret now.

21:50.041 --> 21:53.578
You knew that we were...

21:53.579 --> 21:56.848
Nariko and Kai are sisters!

21:56.849 --> 21:58.016
All these years?

21:58.017 --> 22:02.154
Kai, why didn't you say anything?

22:02.155 --> 22:05.190
Master Shen didn't want
to be Kai's daddy.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.860
I can't believe it. You
must have felt so alone.

22:08.861 --> 22:13.064
Kai not alone. Always have you.

22:13.065 --> 22:17.836
And that man with the raven,
he said we have a brother.

22:17.837 --> 22:21.706
You believe him? A brother?
The chosen one.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.708
We should take it to him.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.977
Yes. Yes, we must Kai.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.713
Bohan said a fishing
village to the north.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.715
There's only one
place he could mean.

22:30.716 --> 22:35.285
- It's on the dead marsh.
- We go there then.

22:37.823 --> 22:39.624
A scout!

22:39.625 --> 22:43.293
- No! I can't...
- Shh.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.370
Ugh!

22:58.477 --> 23:02.013
Kai, I knew you were
good, but how did you...

23:02.014 --> 23:04.015
Nariko, shh.

23:04.016 --> 23:10.187
Don't tell nobody, but
Kai likes to make blood.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.416
The village should be east
of here, beyond that Ridge.

23:40.619 --> 23:45.690
Kai. I'd like to hear
about your mother.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.526
I'm sorry. You don't have...

23:47.527 --> 23:51.096
Mama was strong and funny.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.732
She sang to Kai.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.601
Kai remembers master Shen.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.770
He would give mama gold.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.674
He said to help.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.277
Master Shen never looked at Kai.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.580
Always made Kai very sad.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.649
Kai remembers the fox.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.385
- The fox?
- Flying fox.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.387
He's not very big.

24:15.388 --> 24:18.757
Mama, she knew.
She hid Kai in a cave.

24:18.758 --> 24:22.961
- She knew what?
- That fox had come to get Kai.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.165
Don't know why, but Kai watched.

24:27.166 --> 24:31.269
The fox and his men make
them bleed, Nariko.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.638
Then the fox hurt mama.

24:33.639 --> 24:38.843
Kai wanted to help,
but Kai was scared.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.345
You were just a child.

25:23.655 --> 25:26.490
We're too late.

25:42.173 --> 25:44.441
No, no, no!

25:56.454 --> 26:00.824
You think murdering
innocent people is funny?

26:04.562 --> 26:08.331
Let's see you laugh when
your guts hit the floor.

27:00.685 --> 27:04.956
The town's blacksmith.
I need to find him right away.

27:04.957 --> 27:09.793
The other end of town.
Northeast corner. The big hut.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.600
Go! Get your family away from here.

27:15.601 --> 27:19.269
Keep them close, keep them safe.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.899
Bad man take our brother?

27:59.644 --> 28:03.782
There's no body, no blood.
He could still be alive.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.750
Maybe they took him prisoner.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.296
Nariko.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.980
Don't! We mean you no harm.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.715
We're looking for the blacksmith.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.318
You're looking at him.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.521
You're too old.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.055
And you're too thin.

28:48.426 --> 28:52.028
Claude, they're here to see Loki.

28:56.968 --> 29:00.805
I see your father in your faces.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.912
Loki left over a year ago.

29:07.913 --> 29:12.016
This village was always
too small for him.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.485
Do you know where he's gone?

29:14.486 --> 29:17.822
General Whiptail and her
army destroyed our home,

29:17.823 --> 29:19.991
wanting the same answer.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.359
They're here to kill him.

29:21.360 --> 29:26.631
Oh. And you want to see
him die an old man?

29:26.632 --> 29:28.733
This sword is his destiny.

29:28.734 --> 29:32.002
Hmm. Just what your father said.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.341
Whiptail is nothing.
A cruel servant.

29:36.342 --> 29:40.478
But her master is pure evil,
lighting a flame of terror.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.480
And the world will burn.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.382
Only your son can stop it.

29:46.484 --> 29:51.256
Loki traveled to the northeast,
beyond the great mountains.

29:51.257 --> 29:55.093
He was going as blacksmith
for a foreign king.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.729
Went to find his fortune.

29:57.730 --> 29:59.963
Thank you.

30:00.965 --> 30:05.802
Yes, thank you.

30:08.373 --> 30:12.911
King Bohan can't wait to
meet your boy at last.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.346
Sorry you're going to miss it.

30:15.347 --> 30:20.950
Kill them all and bring
me the pretty sword.

30:45.643 --> 30:47.478
Go. We're fine.

30:47.479 --> 30:53.049
Stop that serpent hag before
she leads them to my son.

31:41.500 --> 31:46.936
Never follow the
spider onto its web.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.924
Die!

32:16.768 --> 32:18.403
You're a fly, little one.

32:18.404 --> 32:23.773
I will suck the life out of you
and take the sword to my master.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.798
You think you've won?

32:46.799 --> 32:51.602
I told the villagers from
that burning cesspool

32:51.603 --> 32:57.075
that whoever informs King Bohan
of the chosen one's whereabouts

32:57.076 --> 33:03.813
will be rewarded beyond
his wildest dreams.

33:06.250 --> 33:11.287
You see, you lose.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.160
Our task is to deliver
this sword to our brother.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.296
Maybe Kai was wrong.

33:18.297 --> 33:21.666
What Nariko did protected Kai.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.836
Sword stopped that
horrid fish lady.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.538
Maybe sword isn't bad.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.875
Kai, I felt its power
flowing through me.

33:30.876 --> 33:36.279
But as it did, I could feel the
sword tearing my soul apart.

33:36.881 --> 33:38.883
The sword will kill the bearer.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.885
It's only a matter of time.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.720
It's too powerful.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.593
<i>Two sisters,</i>

33:48.594 --> 33:50.795
<i>two warriors,</i>

33:50.796 --> 33:56.467
<i>each with their strengths
and frailties,</i>

33:56.468 --> 33:59.637
<i>who grew up alone
behind a wall of lies</i>

33:59.638 --> 34:03.241
<i>their father had built for them.</i>

34:03.242 --> 34:06.444
<i>Innocent children who
only knew betrayal</i>

34:06.445 --> 34:10.114
<i>and disappointment at his hand.</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:14.418
<i>This shame will haunt him forever.</i>

34:14.418 --> 34:18.789
<i>At least now they have each other.</i>

34:18.790 --> 34:21.724
<i>But for how long?</i>

34:38.109 --> 34:40.811
Man with the raven knows.

34:40.812 --> 34:44.280
Kai and Nariko too late.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.984
Kai, I don't think he does know.

34:46.985 --> 34:50.487
He'd be racing to get
there, wouldn't he?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.056
We have to get there first.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.425
It's going to be hard
enough trying to find Loki

34:54.426 --> 34:56.460
in a fortress that big.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.397
Once Bohan's army starts
destroying the place,

34:59.398 --> 35:02.165
it'll be impossible.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.001
Shall we race?

35:05.770 --> 35:07.336
Kai!

35:17.648 --> 35:19.449
Kai, look out!

35:21.052 --> 35:23.920
Well, they started it.

35:47.278 --> 35:51.013
Nariko make more blood than Kai.

35:54.452 --> 35:56.354
We're close.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.389
You know what's strange?

35:58.390 --> 36:00.291
I can feel it.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.560
He's in there.

36:05.030 --> 36:07.196
Nariko!

36:09.367 --> 36:11.569
Sword is bad.

36:11.570 --> 36:12.470
Very bad.

36:12.471 --> 36:16.105
It wants to kill Nariko.

36:18.075 --> 36:19.610
The night is ours, at least.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.013
Bohan's army won't
attack until morning.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.781
We have to hurry.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.488
Nariko.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.623
I'm nearly there.

37:41.793 --> 37:46.630
Why do I get the feeling you're
about to drop this rope?

37:46.631 --> 37:49.667
Oh, no. This is much worse.

37:49.668 --> 37:55.139
The boy, Kai and Nariko's
brother, the chosen one,

37:55.140 --> 37:57.641
traveled to a distant land.

37:57.642 --> 38:00.443
Blacksmith for a foreign king.

38:01.712 --> 38:03.346
And?

38:05.816 --> 38:08.552
Bohan isn't coming to
attack the fortress.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.287
He's coming home.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.424
Our brother's working for a king
who's desperate to kill him.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.426
Unlucky, isn't he?

38:15.427 --> 38:17.428
Or stupid as an ass.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.663
Nariko, no!

38:19.664 --> 38:22.231
Father.

38:23.267 --> 38:27.037
He's alive, Kai. He's alive.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.840
Man with raven lies.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.843
If father's alive,
then perhaps the others...

38:32.844 --> 38:36.747
must be in prison or worse.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.681
Come on.

38:49.059 --> 38:54.130
Faster, old man, or would you
rather be tomorrow's stew?

38:56.233 --> 38:58.034
Hold still.

39:06.076 --> 39:07.244
Nariko?

39:07.245 --> 39:09.513
Kai?

39:09.514 --> 39:13.249
We saw father.
What happened to him?

39:15.286 --> 39:19.456
- Well?
- They tortured him.

39:20.570 --> 39:22.804
Come.

39:41.579 --> 39:45.249
He is guarded at all times.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.150
They never leave his...

40:08.672 --> 40:12.141
Nariko, is it really you?

40:17.715 --> 40:20.718
What have you done?

40:20.719 --> 40:24.054
Why would you bring the
sword to this place?

40:24.055 --> 40:25.689
Foolish girl.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.591
I didn't ask to be rescued!

40:27.592 --> 40:29.460
We're not here for you.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.494
Little brother is here.

40:32.162 --> 40:34.431
What is she talking about?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.866
The chosen one.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.602
All your hard work paid off.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.304
You had a son.

40:40.305 --> 40:43.574
He knows nothing of his destiny.

40:43.575 --> 40:46.076
I... have a son?

40:46.077 --> 40:49.647
So there is hope.

40:49.648 --> 40:52.683
Yeah, thanks to the
daughter you ignored

40:52.684 --> 40:54.518
and the daughter you rejected.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.053
But don't you worry, father.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.821
We'll deliver the
sword you worshipped

40:57.822 --> 41:02.226
to the clueless son you
never knew existed.

41:02.227 --> 41:08.198
I was doing the right thing
for the clan, for the world,

41:08.199 --> 41:11.235
and I won't apologize
for the choices I made,

41:11.236 --> 41:13.737
especially not to...

41:13.738 --> 41:15.472
Your worthless daughters?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.641
I'm so sorry.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.544
I am truly sorry.

41:22.079 --> 41:24.180
I understand.

41:24.715 --> 41:29.520
But know as I leave this world,
I journey to a dark place

41:29.521 --> 41:33.289
where I will rightly
suffer for my sins.

41:34.892 --> 41:37.161
Kai!

41:37.162 --> 41:41.263
Kai not want the first
touch to be a hawk.

41:42.499 --> 41:45.035
Thank you, my daughter.

41:46.536 --> 41:48.771
Forgive me.

41:52.643 --> 41:58.549
Nariko, now go. Both of you.

41:58.550 --> 42:02.052
Find your brother. Save this world.

42:11.129 --> 42:14.897
Please. I don't want
you to see me die.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.686
Nariko!

42:41.125 --> 42:43.994
How... how is this?

42:43.995 --> 42:46.997
You are not the chosen one, Nariko.

42:46.998 --> 42:50.734
You're right, father.
I am not the chosen one.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.303
You must never do that again.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.872
You understand?

42:54.873 --> 42:57.641
- I know what I'm doing.
- Hush!

42:57.642 --> 43:00.344
Don't ever let me do that again.

43:00.345 --> 43:03.681
Now, how do we get
you all out of here?

43:03.682 --> 43:06.917
Don't be a fool. Bohan's returning.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.720
Just leave us. You
have a job to do.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.890
First we're getting
you off this rock,

43:12.891 --> 43:16.060
then you're on your own.

43:16.061 --> 43:19.463
We can cross the narrow
path to the outer wall,

43:19.464 --> 43:21.598
but the trolley is guarded.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.867
Not anymore it isn't

43:23.868 --> 43:26.802
oh! Trolley ride?

43:41.051 --> 43:43.285
Make sure it's still clear.

43:53.397 --> 43:55.099
All dead.

43:55.100 --> 43:58.434
Go now. Lead our people to safety.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.805
Come.

44:08.846 --> 44:11.582
Father, where's Kyo?

44:11.583 --> 44:13.817
He bought us time to escape.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.520
One man against an army.

44:16.521 --> 44:22.092
Had he known of Bohan's trap,
perhaps he would have stayed.

44:22.093 --> 44:25.629
Perhaps he would have lived.

44:25.630 --> 44:28.599
He died bravely, Nariko,

44:28.600 --> 44:31.335
for the sake of the clan.

44:31.336 --> 44:33.337
Go, father.

44:33.338 --> 44:36.305
Go with your people.

44:42.079 --> 44:46.615
Nariko, how do we
find little brother?

44:47.384 --> 44:50.821
An army like this would
need a huge forge.

44:50.822 --> 44:52.923
That's where to find a blacksmith.

44:52.924 --> 44:55.624
That's where we'll
meet our brother.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.560
Race me?

44:59.630 --> 45:01.830
Of course I'll race you.

45:08.472 --> 45:11.307
We're too late.

45:12.876 --> 45:15.679
Loki, the chosen one.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.347
Little brother.

45:17.348 --> 45:18.947
That's right!

45:20.250 --> 45:25.088
You and the villagers have
turned against one of your own.

45:25.089 --> 45:28.458
I know what you were told.

45:28.459 --> 45:31.493
You come seeking reward.

45:32.462 --> 45:33.897
Others arrived after you.

45:33.898 --> 45:38.468
Within minutes, in fact, all
carrying the same information.

45:38.469 --> 45:40.604
They, too, came seeking reward.

45:40.605 --> 45:43.240
They're all dead now.

45:46.477 --> 45:49.613
But you were the first.

45:49.614 --> 45:52.848
Your reward is gold. Now go.

45:53.383 --> 45:57.921
I must inform your
father that we have...

45:57.922 --> 46:00.724
the chosen one.

46:09.833 --> 46:12.569
Yes! They have found him!

46:12.570 --> 46:17.107
And they know their orders
to kill him... now!

46:17.108 --> 46:18.774
Hah!

46:45.168 --> 46:48.739
So, this is the chosen one.

46:50.241 --> 46:53.242
Daddy been lookin' for you.

46:53.243 --> 46:55.946
For a hundred years.

46:55.947 --> 46:57.547
Twenty years.

46:57.548 --> 47:01.618
Yeah, twenty, yeah.
Never had time for me.

47:01.619 --> 47:04.888
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

47:04.889 --> 47:10.527
He's saying his daddy
wasn't a very good daddy.

47:10.528 --> 47:12.329
I never knew my father.

47:12.330 --> 47:17.301
Let me buy us both a mug of
ale, and we can weep into them.

47:19.570 --> 47:22.339
He's so funny!

47:22.340 --> 47:24.808
I like him!

47:24.809 --> 47:28.744
Oh, yeah. I got a nicer dada.

47:36.253 --> 47:42.191
Let him go, big man,
if you want to live.

48:06.950 --> 48:09.751
Nariko, give Loki the sword!

48:41.685 --> 48:45.120
The sword! Get the sword!

49:39.242 --> 49:40.343
No.

49:40.344 --> 49:40.844
No!

49:45.549 --> 49:47.484
Loki.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.252
Who are you?

49:49.253 --> 49:52.089
We are your sisters.

49:52.090 --> 49:56.593
I don't, uh... I don't understand.

49:56.594 --> 50:00.330
Do you know the legend
of the heavenly sword?

50:00.331 --> 50:04.201
I've heard others speak of it.

50:04.202 --> 50:07.104
What does this have to do with me?

50:07.105 --> 50:10.507
Our father is master Shen.

50:10.508 --> 50:16.513
The protector of the
sword is my father?

50:16.514 --> 50:17.814
Our father?

50:17.815 --> 50:21.184
And you are his only born son.

50:21.185 --> 50:23.086
That means...

50:23.087 --> 50:26.490
Brother is the chosen one.

50:26.491 --> 50:31.161
I'm honored to have two brave
and beautiful little sisters.

50:31.162 --> 50:33.795
Are you certain that I am?

50:44.774 --> 50:48.912
<i>All my life I have dreamed
of this very moment,</i>

50:48.913 --> 50:52.849
<i>but I never thought
it could be real.</i>

50:52.850 --> 50:57.287
<i>Never understood what it meant...</i>

50:57.288 --> 51:00.055
<i>until now.</i>

51:18.008 --> 51:20.776
The chosen one.

51:25.582 --> 51:29.052
The king's oafish son, I take it.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.954
He'll be angry.

51:30.955 --> 51:34.124
I'm going to do a lot more
than make Bohan angry.

51:34.125 --> 51:37.761
Not the king. His
imbecile man-child.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.363
A fall like that wouldn't kill him.

51:40.364 --> 51:43.231
Just make him mad.

51:53.043 --> 51:56.846
Oh, yes, yes. Now I understand.

51:56.847 --> 51:58.648
And what of the curse?

51:58.649 --> 52:01.451
You seem more or less alive to me.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.019
Yes.

52:03.020 --> 52:08.792
Perhaps I shan't deliver this
immaculate weapon to my master.

52:08.793 --> 52:13.196
With this sword,
I should be master.

52:13.197 --> 52:14.831
I will never let that happen.

52:14.832 --> 52:19.970
I respect your commitment in
the face of total failure.

52:19.971 --> 52:23.440
You've got a lot of
passion for a dead girl.

52:23.441 --> 52:26.243
You of all people should
know that holding the sword

52:26.244 --> 52:28.278
and wielding it are
not the same thing.

52:28.279 --> 52:31.648
You think I haven't
held it long enough

52:31.649 --> 52:34.584
to know its little
tricks, am I right?

52:34.585 --> 52:38.754
Well, let's see, shall we?

52:44.494 --> 52:46.962
My turn.

53:00.477 --> 53:02.579
I know some tricks, too.

53:02.580 --> 53:06.049
Would you like to see another?

53:06.050 --> 53:11.087
You are formidable, which is
both unnerving and refreshing.

53:11.088 --> 53:14.524
It's your concentration.
You control your fear,

53:14.525 --> 53:19.696
your anger, the sword, and the
curse, all at the same time.

53:19.697 --> 53:23.967
Impressive, but I'm
wondering what happens

53:23.968 --> 53:27.402
when you're distracted.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.823
Kai!

53:47.124 --> 53:49.526
You know what I find interesting?

53:49.527 --> 53:52.696
Some people though you
would be the chosen one.

53:52.697 --> 53:55.665
Then, of course, all
the attention turned

53:55.666 --> 53:58.435
to that headless brother of yours.

53:58.436 --> 54:00.437
But no one ever considered Kai.

54:00.438 --> 54:04.841
Childlike, innocent,
the perfect vessel.

54:04.842 --> 54:08.276
Shame, really. We'll never know.

54:10.847 --> 54:12.948
No!

59:52.455 --> 59:54.856
No!

59:55.291 --> 59:58.626
Take me home, Nariko.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:50.411
Sound the alarm.
All forces to the great forge.

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:02.692
If we are to die, we will
die with our people.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:03.793
No!

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:05.995
You're just going to die.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.664
Of that, I can assure you.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.466
If you lay down the sword,

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:14.303
I vow that I will make it quick
and relatively painless.

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:18.241
But run, and I assure you
that I will scorch the earth,

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:21.711
slaughtering every man,
woman, and child in my path

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:25.413
until it's in my hands.

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:31.788
How many more innocent
people must die

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:35.224
because of your insolence, Nariko?

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:38.895
Do you want any more
blood on your hands?

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:41.464
No. It's all over yours.

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:46.469
And if I give in to you, then
we will have died for nothing.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.870
As you wish.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.775
What are you waiting for?

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:55.977
Kill her and bring me that sword!

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.566
Hold on tight.

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:34.617
I'm sorry.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:37.753
Muster the army. The entire army.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.556
Guards, even men in training.

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:43.991
We leave immediately.

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.424
Three days.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.492
Shall I send scouts?

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.897
She has failed.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:57.366
You don't know that.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:58.768
How could she not?

01:03:58.769 --> 01:04:01.270
This was never her burden to bear.

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.172
If she had found the chosen one,

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.374
we would have received word by now.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.442
There!

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.901
No!

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:54.156
Nariko, daughter.
Please. Look at me.

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:57.026
Where... where is my son?

01:04:57.027 --> 01:04:59.061
Where is the chosen one?

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:03.632
Your other daughter
is dying, father.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.768
Do you not care?

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:09.270
We all die without him, Nariko.

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.240
Please, answer me!

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.476
Your son is dead, old man.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:17.246
He was no more chosen than
the fool that spawned him.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:19.815
Take her inside.
Make her comfortable.

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:22.485
Bohan approaches.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:27.156
You led him here?
But what will we do?

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:31.259
The same thing you always do: Hide.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:35.965
But you're not...
You can't possibly win.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:39.000
Why would you fight for us?

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:48.309
I'm going to fight for Kai,
the only family I have.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:30.251
Our journey has ended.
There's no turning back.

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.835
You know what to do.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:04.285
Either move aside or die.
I don't care which.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:10.926
Hello, Nariko.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:12.595
Kyo?

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:16.599
It doesn't have to end this way.
All he wants is the sword.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.603
Give it to him. No one has to die.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:25.840
I... I don't understand. How did...

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.279
it was you.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.917
That's how Bohan knew
where to find the sword.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.085
You told him.

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:38.654
For us, Nariko. For the clan.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.323
He was coming. He
was always coming.

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.058
It was prophesized.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.327
And with no chosen
one to protect us,

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:49.098
I had to do it... to save us.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:51.367
Give him the sword, Nariko.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:53.402
I should have let you die
when I had the chance.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:56.172
Give him the sword, and
we can finally be free.

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:58.274
Understand this, Kyo.

01:07:58.275 --> 01:08:01.942
I will never give Bohan the sword.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:18.392
He will get it, you know.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:22.464
And every one of you will die.

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:23.799
No, Kyo.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.368
For now, only you will die.

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:34.890
All my life, I have listened
to my people praising you,

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:38.927
tell your tales, protect
you, die for you.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:41.629
Well, I curse you.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:48.270
You wait until now?
Now to take my life?

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:51.240
Send me back!

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:52.674
My people will die.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:56.745
My sister will die. Send me back!

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.514
And you?

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:01.448
You will die, too!

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:06.722
Bohan doesn't want to
hold you. He fears you.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:08.724
He's there to destroy you.

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.593
He'll be sneering as he
throws you into his forge.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.862
Your metal will heat, turn red,

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:17.499
and you will melt away
until you are nothing.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.768
If I die, you die.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:24.571
I don't care about
you, but you need me!

01:12:58.106 --> 01:13:00.341
Kill her!

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.173
O holy one,

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:37.112
grant me the power to send
this abomination back to hell.

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:38.614
Please!

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:42.050
I've given my life to you.
My every waking moment.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:45.387
Will you not grant
me this one wish?

01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:49.091
Do me this honor, and my...

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:53.060
and my soul is yours.

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:28.529
Hell beckons, Nariko.

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:32.134
I'm here to send you back!

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:36.503
It seems to me you're
only here to talk.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:36.191
Help... me.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.633
Help.

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.976
No, no, no!

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:55.844
No!

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.580
Please don't hurt daddy!

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:03.418
Oh, daddy, daddy! Don't go, dad.

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:07.656
My... son.

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:11.493
I won't let her hurt
you no more, daddy.

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:15.230
You hear me? You go now!

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:18.767
You go now or roach will fight you!

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:22.436
I'll fight you good.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:31.079
My dear child. It was always you.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.582
I should never have doubted.

01:17:33.583 --> 01:17:37.517
You are the chosen one.

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:42.424
No, father. You were wrong.

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:44.860
We were all wrong.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.796
The sword did not choose me.

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:50.998
I chose the sword.

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:55.670
I love you, sister.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:59.574
And I love you, Nariko.

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:04.645
I'm sorry I have to... go.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.310
No. No!

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:39.946
What have you done?

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.119
I loved...

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.423
I loved a sister I
didn't know I had.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:51.293
Nariko, no! Don't...

01:18:51.294 --> 01:18:53.094
Don't leave me.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:57.933
This was inevitable.
Deities cannot stay, Kai.

01:18:57.934 --> 01:19:01.902
This way... this way you can.

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:06.608
The sword, it is yours now.

01:19:06.609 --> 01:19:09.376
Keep it safe.

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:15.684
And you, do for her what
you never did for me:

01:19:15.685 --> 01:19:18.452
Love her.

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:24.259
No!

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:42.077
<i>Belief can change
worlds, shape lives,</i>

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:44.279
<i>but it can also make us blind.</i>

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:54.087
<i>Kai, you know the truth
about the sword.</i>

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:58.460
<i>Others have worshipped
it, murdered for it,</i>

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:01.928
<i>but you will master it.</i>

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:08.503
<i>Keep the sword safe,</i>

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:11.439
<i>and one day it may be forgotten.</i>

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.608
<i>But you will always be remembered.</i>

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.103
<i>Farewell, my sister.</i>

01:20:18.104 --> 01:20:21.594
<i>May we meet again
in a better world.</i>
