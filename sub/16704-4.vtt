00:19.369 --> 00:22.472
Uhh....

00:24.008 --> 00:25.274
Tina, if you're gonna
lay on the floor,

00:25.342 --> 00:27.510
at least roll around so I don't have
to mop up later.

00:27.578 --> 00:28.678
What's wrong with Tina?

00:28.746 --> 00:29.879
Puberty.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.547
Yeah. She's pubing out

00:31.616 --> 00:33.049
right now pretty bad.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.617
Jordan Sturman moved away,

00:34.684 --> 00:37.419
and now I'll never play
kickball with him again.

00:37.487 --> 00:40.089
- Oh, you should kill yourself.
- Yeah!

00:40.156 --> 00:41.890
Gene and Louise, be nice.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.692
You're gonna go through
adolescence, too, you know.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.694
Like that? Oh, sick!

00:45.762 --> 00:48.163
Is she contagious?
You shut up, mom!

00:48.231 --> 00:49.331
Watch it.

00:49.398 --> 00:51.299
You can't hurt me.
I'm already dead.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.634
Can I have your mustache, then?

00:52.701 --> 00:53.868
It's only one hair.

00:53.936 --> 00:56.037
It's the beginning
of a great thing.

00:56.105 --> 00:57.205
It's a huge hair.

00:57.273 --> 00:58.240
I can't cut it.

00:58.307 --> 00:59.508
It's beautiful.
Leave her alone.

00:59.575 --> 01:01.075
You're beautiful, Tina.
Let me pull it out.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.278
Let me put my foot
on your chest.

01:03.346 --> 01:04.879
Gene, get off. Enough.

01:04.947 --> 01:07.549
Come on, gene.
Let's go have a childhood.

01:08.717 --> 01:12.053
My heart.
My heart.

01:12.121 --> 01:13.921
Shh, sweetie. I'm on the phone.

01:13.989 --> 01:16.924
Ginger is very upset.
Ha ha! Go on, ginger.

01:16.992 --> 01:19.861
What? Ha ha ha! No!

01:19.928 --> 01:21.362
Come on, Tina. Get up.
You're on the grill.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.830
Why?

01:22.898 --> 01:24.131
Come on. Cheer up, you know?
We're having fun.

01:24.198 --> 01:25.832
- We are?
- Yeah.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.467
Plus, it's
father-daughter time.

01:27.535 --> 01:29.903
Why don't gene and Louise
have to have fun like this?

01:29.971 --> 01:31.504
Well, Tina, you're the oldest,

01:31.572 --> 01:33.173
and you have added
responsibilities here,

01:33.240 --> 01:36.109
like on Saturday mornings, for example,
you're on the grill.

01:36.177 --> 01:37.377
I can't trust them
on the grill.

01:37.444 --> 01:39.345
You know that.
Fire comes out of it.

01:39.413 --> 01:41.180
Ha ha! I know. It's awful.

01:41.247 --> 01:43.415
All right. Bye.

01:43.483 --> 01:47.286
Ginger's cat died
but in a really funny way.

01:47.353 --> 01:50.189
- Ha ha ha!
- Oh...

01:50.256 --> 01:52.992
Tina, we just saw
the most amazing thing ever.

01:53.060 --> 01:55.360
This might be the best day
of my life,

01:55.428 --> 01:57.896
besides the day
you kids were born.

01:57.963 --> 01:59.197
Words can't explain this.

01:59.264 --> 02:00.498
You just have to see it.

02:00.566 --> 02:01.800
Come with us. Come on, Tina!

02:01.867 --> 02:03.968
I can't. Dad won't
let me leave work...

02:04.036 --> 02:05.236
I mean, fun.

02:05.304 --> 02:07.405
He won't let me leave fun
father-daughter time.

02:07.472 --> 02:08.872
You fell for that?

02:08.941 --> 02:10.208
That's not a real thing.

02:10.275 --> 02:11.609
Come with us.

02:11.677 --> 02:13.110
Aw, Bob, let her go.

02:13.178 --> 02:15.445
All right, fine, but you're gonna miss
when I scrape off the grill.

02:15.513 --> 02:17.147
That's the best part
of the day,

02:17.215 --> 02:18.816
although today
has been pretty slow,

02:18.883 --> 02:21.985
so there's not gonna be
as much gunk to...

02:22.053 --> 02:24.287
oh. Everyone is gone.

02:26.091 --> 02:29.325
Oh. Ow. Oh!

02:29.392 --> 02:32.561
Aren't you supposed to lead
someone who's blindfolded?

02:32.629 --> 02:34.197
It would ruin the surprise.

02:34.264 --> 02:35.431
Where are we going?

02:35.498 --> 02:37.333
At first, we thought
it was a breakdancing class,

02:37.400 --> 02:40.002
and them we thought it was
a special needs class.

02:40.070 --> 02:43.072
Now we think it might be
a special needs breakdancing class.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.107
Also, it's brazilian...

02:45.174 --> 02:46.441
Slash hilarious.

02:46.508 --> 02:48.309
- Sounds interest...
- Stupid?

02:48.377 --> 02:52.013
Oh, it's even more stupid
than you could possibly imagine.

02:52.081 --> 02:53.248
Just wait till we get near it.

02:53.315 --> 02:55.016
They take off their shoes

02:55.084 --> 02:56.218
so when they open the door,

02:56.285 --> 02:58.120
the whole block
smells like feet.

02:58.187 --> 03:00.287
Feet that have been
cooked in feet.

03:02.523 --> 03:07.027
- Yes!
- Still funny. Ha!

03:07.095 --> 03:09.864
Oh! Ooh. Ooh.
Can you smell that?

03:09.931 --> 03:12.032
That's just what's
coming through the walls.

03:14.102 --> 03:18.271
That smells exotic,
like ranch dressing.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.013
Whoa, he's beautiful.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.581
That's a man?

03:28.649 --> 03:29.849
Where are you going?

03:29.917 --> 03:31.984
I'm signing up for that class.
What? Why?

03:32.051 --> 03:34.319
- Oh!
- Don't open the door!

03:34.387 --> 03:36.421
The smell will kill us all!

03:36.489 --> 03:39.524
Let me go. Let go of me.

03:39.592 --> 03:41.193
- No!
- No!

03:41.261 --> 03:43.561
Oh, the feet smell.

03:43.629 --> 03:46.165
The feet smell.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.579
Wait. What is it?

03:50.646 --> 03:52.647
- It's Capoeira.
- Capo-what?

03:52.715 --> 03:54.183
Tina, are you really sure
you want to do this?

03:54.250 --> 03:56.750
Yes, dad. Wait till you see it.

03:56.818 --> 03:59.153
Jairo is amazing. I have a DVD.

03:59.221 --> 04:02.056
Oh, by the way, I need
$14.95 for the DVD.

04:02.124 --> 04:04.592
Wait. What? What's jairo?

04:04.659 --> 04:06.160
Hyah!

04:06.228 --> 04:08.162
Ola. My name is jairo.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.631
Welcome to the world
of Capoeira.

04:10.699 --> 04:14.034
Capoeira is the most seductive
form of self-defense.

04:14.102 --> 04:16.603
It combines peacefulness,
fighting, and cardio

04:16.670 --> 04:18.171
in perfect harmony.

04:18.238 --> 04:20.173
Capoeira is breathtaking,

04:20.241 --> 04:23.243
but it is also breath-giving.

04:23.311 --> 04:25.178
You can advance
through the stages

04:25.246 --> 04:29.948
by earning different colored
cords at the troca de cordoes.

04:30.017 --> 04:31.617
Wow, I thought maybe
you were doing it wrong,

04:31.684 --> 04:33.252
but that's actually
what it looks like.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.087
They're bringing
the tambourine back.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.556
That's a pandeiro,
a brazilian frame drum.

04:37.624 --> 04:40.059
It's a tambourine.
I'm gonna get mine.

04:40.127 --> 04:42.061
Those guys don't know
how to shake it.

04:42.129 --> 04:43.996
I don't get it.
I mean, what am I looking at here?

04:44.063 --> 04:46.498
What is it? Is it some kind of dancing.
What is it?

04:46.565 --> 04:48.233
Jairo says it's not dancing.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.135
It's a deadly form
of street fighting.

04:50.202 --> 04:53.338
Oh, yeah? Well, you don't need
some male model to teach you how to fight.

04:53.406 --> 04:55.073
That's what dads are for.

04:55.141 --> 04:56.441
Come on.
I'll show you some stuff.

04:56.509 --> 04:58.276
Box with your old man, huh?

04:58.344 --> 05:00.210
Uh! Uh! There you go.

05:00.278 --> 05:03.047
Just got to... there it is. Uh!

05:03.114 --> 05:05.282
Whoa, Tina. Good fight.
Good fight.

05:05.350 --> 05:06.983
That was fun to watch.

05:07.052 --> 05:09.053
Jairo says if there's
any Capoeira inside me,

05:09.120 --> 05:11.221
he'll find it
with enough classes.

05:11.289 --> 05:14.258
- Jairo knows a lot about life.
- Hmm.

05:16.193 --> 05:18.428
- Jairo says he can hypnotize animals.
- Shh.

05:18.495 --> 05:20.229
But only if they want
to be hypnotized...

05:20.297 --> 05:21.497
Tina, shh shh shh shh.

05:21.565 --> 05:23.533
- Which they almost always do.
- Tina!

05:23.600 --> 05:25.601
Jairo says toothpaste
insults your teeth.

05:25.669 --> 05:28.003
Tina, go to bed.

05:28.072 --> 05:30.440
Jairo only needs two
hours of sleep a night

05:30.507 --> 05:32.674
because he regulates his heart.

05:32.741 --> 05:35.677
Tina, get out.

05:35.744 --> 05:38.580
- Jairo sleeps with his eyes open.
- Tina!

05:38.647 --> 05:40.848
Ok. Just follow my lead.

05:42.318 --> 05:46.888
Sa! Sha! Brazil!
Sa! Sha! Brazil!

05:53.761 --> 05:56.263
Class is over.

05:56.331 --> 05:58.632
We now have an hour
of open practice time,

05:58.700 --> 06:03.504
which is completely optional unless
you're serious about Capoeira.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.371
Mm. Mm!

06:05.439 --> 06:07.941
Mm! Mm!

06:08.009 --> 06:10.077
Ho! Yah!

06:10.144 --> 06:12.045
Oh, I'm definitely staying.

06:12.113 --> 06:15.482
Ah! Ho! Hih! Sa!

06:17.184 --> 06:19.419
Tina is supposed to be
here to cover the grill.

06:19.487 --> 06:20.953
It's after 4:30.

06:21.021 --> 06:23.189
She's at a kookaburra class.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.958
Dad, the grill is doing
that thing again.

06:26.026 --> 06:27.427
Ach.

06:27.495 --> 06:29.628
What is your problem with fire?

06:29.695 --> 06:31.696
You know what? Go. Go away.

06:31.764 --> 06:35.033
Go down and collect trash
and bring it to the dumpster.

06:35.101 --> 06:37.269
Does it have to be from around here,
or can we go anywhere?

06:37.337 --> 06:39.404
Just go. Yay! Yeah! Trash!

06:39.472 --> 06:41.206
♪ Trash! Trash! Trash! Trash! ♪

06:41.274 --> 06:43.175
Yesterday I found a necklace.

06:43.243 --> 06:44.976
It's time for
my afternoon meeting,

06:45.044 --> 06:46.144
you know, in the bathroom.

06:46.211 --> 06:48.012
Your 4:30 meeting?
Yeah, my 4:30.

06:48.079 --> 06:49.514
- So go.
- No.

06:49.581 --> 06:51.982
Tina made a commitment
to be here at a certain time.

06:52.050 --> 06:53.717
I'm going down there
to remind her

06:53.785 --> 06:55.586
- that she has a job here.
- Wait.

06:55.654 --> 06:56.987
What about your meeting?

06:57.055 --> 06:58.322
Well, I'm postponing it today.

06:58.390 --> 06:59.857
Bob, you can't do that.

06:59.924 --> 07:02.325
I'm gonna set a time
for 10:30 tonight.

07:02.393 --> 07:03.926
This is why I tell you, Bob,

07:03.994 --> 07:06.296
just have little meetings
throughout the day

07:06.364 --> 07:08.565
instead of one big one,
little poops.

07:09.667 --> 07:12.902
Oof! Oh! That is horrible.

07:12.970 --> 07:15.071
Wash your feet.
I have an infection.

07:15.139 --> 07:17.540
Tina. Tine. Psst psst psst.

07:17.607 --> 07:19.208
Dad, what are you doing here?

07:19.276 --> 07:21.210
You're supposed to be
back at work, Tina,

07:21.278 --> 07:24.012
to cover me for
my 4:30 meeting.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.614
- Dad...
- Oh, hello.

07:25.682 --> 07:27.416
Please remove your shoes.

07:27.484 --> 07:29.485
Oh, I don't want to
take off my shoes.

07:29.553 --> 07:31.253
I'm just picking up
my daughter Tina.

07:31.321 --> 07:33.121
Oh, you are Tina's father.

07:33.189 --> 07:36.057
Ola. My name is jairo,
like "gyrate."

07:36.124 --> 07:38.125
Ola. Mine is Bob.

07:38.194 --> 07:40.228
Are you sure you
don't want to stick around?

07:40.296 --> 07:43.364
I enjoy helping elderly men
repair their aging bodies.

07:43.432 --> 07:45.533
Thanks, but I got a job
I got to get back to,

07:45.601 --> 07:48.203
and so does Tina, plus
I don't really dance.

07:48.270 --> 07:51.371
Although Capoeira incorporates
elements of dance,

07:51.439 --> 07:54.474
it is a highly dangerous
form of martial arts.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.943
Right. I'm sure it is.

07:57.011 --> 07:59.045
It seems like a great
way to stay in shape,

07:59.113 --> 08:02.015
like jazzercise.

08:02.083 --> 08:05.618
Not like jazzercise.
Whatever you say.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.855
Class, would you like
to see a demonstration?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.191
Come on, Tina.
Let's go right now.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.327
Sha! Hyah! Sha! Hyah!

08:14.394 --> 08:17.263
Ok, ok. I saw your movie.
It's very cute.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.598
Hyah! Ponytail!

08:18.665 --> 08:20.399
Hey! You can't do that.
You just hit me with your hair.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.100
- Ponytail!
- Stop that!

08:22.167 --> 08:25.036
Hyah! Sa! Huh! Oh! Uh-oh.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.405
Dad, let's go. Come on.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.441
Give me a second here.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.042
What about your meeting?

08:31.110 --> 08:32.309
I just had my meeting.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.010
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.280
Uh...

08:36.349 --> 08:37.414
Don't. Don't.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.416
What do we do?

08:39.484 --> 08:42.453
- Grab me that flag.
- No, dad.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.223
Tina, we're gonna
get out of there, all right?

08:46.291 --> 08:48.225
Just let me think. Shh!

08:48.293 --> 08:49.426
All right. I got an idea.

08:49.494 --> 08:51.328
- You go into the corner and yell.
- What?

08:51.396 --> 08:52.596
Go in the corner
and start yelling

08:52.664 --> 08:54.430
like you're having a heart
attack, and I'll run out.

08:54.498 --> 08:56.866
Ok. Go. Go. Fast.
Wait. Come back..

08:56.933 --> 08:58.968
- I'm having a heart... what?
- Don't... shh!

08:59.035 --> 09:00.503
Don't do that.
It's a dumb idea.

09:00.571 --> 09:03.406
Dad, I'm so embarrassed.

09:03.474 --> 09:04.874
Oh, oh, are you?

09:04.941 --> 09:07.443
I'm sorry because I'm
not embarrassed at all

09:07.511 --> 09:09.278
because I just pooped my pants.

09:09.345 --> 09:11.457
I would do this every
day if I could, Tina.

09:14.219 --> 09:16.336
No, no.
He's in the shower now.

09:16.587 --> 09:19.890
Well, sometimes it's hard to feel clean
after something like that happens.

09:19.957 --> 09:22.292
It's very embarrassing.
Ok, kids.

09:22.359 --> 09:24.660
Your father is very
tender right now, all right?

09:24.728 --> 09:27.863
Whatever you do, do not mention what
happened today at Tina's class.

09:27.931 --> 09:30.599
Just act normal.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.601
So you pooped your pants.

09:32.669 --> 09:34.203
Linda, let's not talk about it.

09:34.270 --> 09:35.470
Wasn't a fair fight.

09:35.538 --> 09:37.807
He's younger, and
he's cute and strong.

09:37.874 --> 09:39.008
Linda, this isn't helpful.

09:39.076 --> 09:40.875
Hey, when you got to
go, you got to go.

09:40.943 --> 09:42.443
Linda, stop!

09:42.511 --> 09:45.814
- Are you on the phone with ginger?
- No. I got to go.

09:45.881 --> 09:48.750
Ha ha ha! Sorry, Bobby.

09:48.818 --> 09:50.885
I'm not laughing at you.

09:50.953 --> 09:53.487
I was thinking about
ginger's dead cat again.

09:53.555 --> 09:55.823
- Dad, dad, dad.
- Yes, Louise?

09:55.890 --> 09:57.490
- Dad, dad, hi.
- Yes? Hi.

09:57.558 --> 09:59.526
Did you know that it only takes
two pounds of pressure

09:59.594 --> 10:01.628
to drive someone's nose bone
into their brain?

10:01.696 --> 10:02.830
That's... what?

10:02.897 --> 10:04.898
Two pounds. That's it, dad.

10:04.966 --> 10:06.800
Why are you telling
me this, Louise?

10:06.868 --> 10:08.035
Revenge.

10:08.103 --> 10:10.503
♪ Revengeourine revengeourine
revengeourine ♪

10:10.571 --> 10:12.471
- Cut it out, gene.
- All right. Listen, everybody.

10:12.539 --> 10:13.906
What happened today
is in the past,

10:13.974 --> 10:16.408
and we're never gonna talk
about it again ever.

10:16.476 --> 10:19.378
I'm just glad Tina is quitting
the class, right, Tina?

10:19.446 --> 10:20.913
But my body needs it.

10:20.981 --> 10:24.050
Your body needs to work in the
restaurant with your father.

10:24.118 --> 10:27.319
Ohh...Oh, fine.

10:27.387 --> 10:31.890
If you need me, I'll be down here
on the floor dying.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.058
All right. Sounds good, honey.

10:33.126 --> 10:35.026
Ohh...

10:35.094 --> 10:36.995
You have to learn to
groan right, Tina.

10:37.063 --> 10:38.529
Ohh...

10:38.597 --> 10:40.832
Hey, she groans fine.
It sounds weird.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.834
So you groan, then,
if you're so good at it.

10:42.902 --> 10:43.868
Agh.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.870
- That's a groan?
- Yeah. Agh.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.938
- I'll do it. Let me do it.
- Agh.

10:48.006 --> 10:50.941
Aagh... Aggggh... Ach...

10:51.009 --> 10:53.510
Ahh... Meow meow... Aggggh...

10:53.578 --> 10:56.580
Brr brr! Gg gg gg! Ohh...

10:56.648 --> 10:59.516
- Ohh...
- Tina, enough already. Come on.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.851
Tina,
it's your boyfriend.

11:01.919 --> 11:03.552
Oh, God.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.321
- Ola.
- What do you want?

11:05.389 --> 11:07.991
I got a message that
Tina was very upset

11:08.058 --> 11:09.959
and needed to be
encouraged to come back

11:10.027 --> 11:11.661
to the art of Capoeira.

11:11.728 --> 11:12.829
A message? From who?

11:12.897 --> 11:16.498
You're welcome,
and...You're welcome.

11:16.565 --> 11:18.633
Well, I'm sorry. Tina is busy.
She's working the grill.

11:18.701 --> 11:21.036
It's ok. I'll wait.

11:21.104 --> 11:23.972
Hmm. Ah...

11:24.040 --> 11:26.875
Uh...Well...

11:26.943 --> 11:28.310
What's wrong?

11:28.377 --> 11:30.645
Well, I'm looking for your
fresh-squeezed juice selection.

11:30.713 --> 11:31.979
Is it on another menu?

11:32.047 --> 11:33.981
Ahem.

11:34.049 --> 11:36.350
Oh. Sorry. Here.
Yeah. Here it is.

11:36.418 --> 11:37.584
This is the same menu.

11:37.652 --> 11:39.120
Yeah, because we don't have
fresh-squeezed juice.

11:39.188 --> 11:40.822
Fresh-squeezed juice is stupid.

11:40.889 --> 11:41.956
That is not how I talk at all.

11:42.024 --> 11:44.591
Yes, it is. So it Capoeira.
It's stupid, ok?

11:44.659 --> 11:47.561
- Dad, stop.
- Oh, hello, Tina.

11:47.629 --> 11:50.363
I didn't notice you. That's ok.

11:50.431 --> 11:51.932
Is everything all right
with you, Tina?

11:51.999 --> 11:53.800
My dad won't let me
train anymore.

11:53.868 --> 11:54.935
- Tina...
- What?

11:55.002 --> 11:56.736
It's because you made him
poop in his pants.

11:56.804 --> 11:58.004
- Oh, my God.
- Tina!

11:58.072 --> 12:01.641
Bob, please. There is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.609
It is quite common
for a wounded animal

12:03.677 --> 12:05.811
to make a bowel movement
as he is defeated

12:05.879 --> 12:07.579
by a much stronger predator.

12:07.647 --> 12:10.015
- Hey, it wasn't you. It was 4:30.
- Here, Bob.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.017
Let me show you
some very convenient

12:12.085 --> 12:13.986
sphincter-tightening exercises.

12:14.054 --> 12:16.322
- No, thank you.
- Tight. Relax.

12:16.389 --> 12:18.490
- I don't want...
- Tight. Relax.

12:18.558 --> 12:20.258
- Stop it!
- Tight.

12:20.326 --> 12:23.328
Don't do sphincter-tightening
exercises in my restaurant.

12:23.395 --> 12:25.496
- Ok. Fine.
- Thank you.

12:25.564 --> 12:27.531
I'll be feeling this
in the morning.

12:27.599 --> 12:29.467
- Hoo!
- Gene!

12:29.534 --> 12:31.970
Well, now my stomach is full
of negative energy,

12:32.037 --> 12:34.438
so I've lost my appetite,
which is just as well.

12:34.506 --> 12:36.740
It's time for me
to go to class.

12:36.807 --> 12:38.541
Tina, you should come with me.

12:38.609 --> 12:41.611
Remember, the troca de cordoes
is next week.

12:41.679 --> 12:43.313
The troca de cordoes?

12:43.381 --> 12:45.515
What's the troca de cordoes?

12:45.583 --> 12:47.084
I feel if Tina trains hard,

12:47.151 --> 12:48.852
she has the potential to receive

12:48.920 --> 12:51.454
a promotion to yellow cord.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.756
Tina, listen to me.
You're not going anywhere.

12:53.823 --> 12:55.491
I'm your father. Yes, Tina...

12:55.558 --> 12:59.095
But I am your
Capoeira instructor.

13:00.330 --> 13:02.798
Wait. I'm going
to class with you.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.900
Tina, what are you doing?

13:03.967 --> 13:05.501
Dad, you don't understand.

13:05.602 --> 13:08.303
I understand you're grounded,
effective right no.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.339
- Bob, let her go.
- No.

13:11.407 --> 13:12.807
She's grounded, Lin.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.542
We all just need
a minute to calm down.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.011
Hey, Tina, you walk
out that door,

13:16.078 --> 13:19.614
and you're no longer
my grill cook.

13:19.681 --> 13:21.950
Dad. Calm down.
I'll go get her.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.484
You get out of here!
You hear me?

13:24.552 --> 13:28.389
Never look back!
You are dead to us.

13:28.456 --> 13:31.458
Sorry, dad. There's no
getting through to that one.

13:31.526 --> 13:34.227
Thanks, Louise.
That was very helpful.

13:35.446 --> 13:37.013
- Big day.
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.081 --> 13:39.950
- Big, big day.
- Hmm...

13:40.017 --> 13:42.552
- The troca de cordios.
- I know.

13:42.619 --> 13:44.935
I know it's the
troca de cordios.

13:45.055 --> 13:46.623
- I told you, I'm not going.
- Ok. Fine.

13:46.690 --> 13:48.491
I'm just gonna say
one more time,

13:48.559 --> 13:50.326
I think that you should
come support your daughter.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.993
Linda, I just grounded her.

13:52.061 --> 13:53.194
You let her go.

13:53.263 --> 13:56.331
Bob, I'm sorry. Ok. Come on.

13:56.399 --> 13:58.367
It's just a phase.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.935
I know you're afraid
your gonna lose your little girl.

14:01.003 --> 14:02.837
That's sweet,
but what'd you think,

14:02.905 --> 14:04.373
she's gonna spend
the rest of her life

14:04.440 --> 14:06.908
standing next to you
grilling burgers?

14:06.976 --> 14:08.910
- Ha ha! Ha ha!
- Ha ha! Ha ha!

14:08.978 --> 14:11.445
- Ha ha! Ha ha!
- Ha ha! Ha ha!

14:11.513 --> 14:14.783
- Ha ha! Ha ha!
- Ha ha! Ha ha!

14:14.850 --> 14:17.351
That's silly, spending
the rest of her life

14:17.419 --> 14:19.087
standing next to me
grilling burgers.

14:19.155 --> 14:20.521
Of course not.

14:20.589 --> 14:21.923
I mean, nothing wrong with it.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.324
I mean, it would be fun.

14:35.736 --> 14:37.470
I love this restaurant.

14:37.538 --> 14:40.173
You can't abandon
the things you love

14:40.240 --> 14:42.208
just because of
sexy dance fighting.

14:42.276 --> 14:44.443
If I were a hamburger,
you'd come watch me fight.

14:44.511 --> 14:47.079
Good job, Bob.
Gene, Louise, come on.

14:47.147 --> 14:51.184
We're going to Tina's
karate concert.

14:51.251 --> 14:54.320
So you're not going
to get revenge today?

14:54.387 --> 14:57.322
- No, Louise. I'm not.
- Ok. Got it.

14:57.389 --> 14:59.524

15:13.038 --> 15:15.472

- What, Teddy?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.374
What's a troca de cordoes?

15:17.442 --> 15:19.977
It's a ceremony.
It's like a graduation.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.245
- Oh.
- Yeah, but this guy is a creep,

15:21.313 --> 15:22.947
and I got to stand my ground.

15:23.014 --> 15:24.982
She made a commitment
to this restaurant, period.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.251
- "Exchange of strands."
- What?

15:27.319 --> 15:29.252
I just looked up
troca de cordoes.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.654
It's portuguese for
"exchange of strands."

15:31.722 --> 15:33.089
Sounds momentous.

15:33.157 --> 15:35.091
This very day,
she's becoming a woman,

15:35.159 --> 15:36.425
exchanging her strands.

15:36.493 --> 15:37.894
Wait. That's what it says?

15:37.962 --> 15:38.995
Yeah. That's what it says.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.897
It says she's becoming a woman?

15:40.965 --> 15:42.365
Well, yeah. Take a look.

15:42.432 --> 15:43.466
What you gonna do
about it, Bob?

15:43.533 --> 15:45.000
Doesn't say becoming a woman.

15:45.068 --> 15:46.301
No. Read into it.

15:46.369 --> 15:47.903
It says, "exchange of strands."

15:47.971 --> 15:49.404
It's exchanging strands.

15:49.472 --> 15:51.006
Has nothing about
her becoming a woman.

15:51.074 --> 15:52.540
What are you saying, Bob?
What are you saying, Teddy?

15:52.608 --> 15:56.111
Just, if my daughter was becoming
a woman, I would want to be there.

15:56.179 --> 15:58.046
She's not becoming
a woman, Teddy.

15:58.114 --> 16:00.214
No, but if she was, I'm saying.
She's not my daughter.

16:00.282 --> 16:02.016
You were the one who
just said it again.

16:02.084 --> 16:03.484
Get out. Get out, Teddy.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.019
I want to pay my bill!
Get out of my restaurant!

16:05.087 --> 16:06.921
I want to pay my bill.

16:06.989 --> 16:10.024
There's your bill...
$4.16, pervert.

16:10.092 --> 16:11.993
- $4... pervert? Pervert?
- Pervert.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.195
- Who you calling pervert?
- It's written on the bill.

16:14.263 --> 16:18.131
Here's your $4.16, Bob.
Best of luck.

16:18.199 --> 16:20.566
There's a million
restaurants I can go to.

16:20.634 --> 16:22.468
Then go to them all, Teddy!

16:22.536 --> 16:25.405
- I'm sorry, Teddy. I get carried away.
- No.

16:25.472 --> 16:28.275
I blew my stack. I'm sorry.

16:28.342 --> 16:31.278
It's just,
she's growing up so fast.

16:31.345 --> 16:33.045
Also, I crapped my pants
yesterday.

16:33.113 --> 16:36.415
Yeah. I know. I heard. Ha ha!

16:36.482 --> 16:38.150
Listen. I got to close up shop.

16:38.218 --> 16:40.052
I have somewhere to be.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.187
So you really do
have to get out.

16:42.255 --> 16:44.056
- Sha!
- Uh...Ah...

16:44.124 --> 16:45.524
Sha! Brazil.

16:45.591 --> 16:47.059
That's my son.

16:47.127 --> 16:48.526
Sha! Sha!

16:48.593 --> 16:50.428
Oh, God.

16:50.495 --> 16:52.530
Brazil! Sha!

16:52.597 --> 16:54.132
Sha! Sha!

16:54.199 --> 16:58.136
And I'm a... Brazil. Finished.

16:58.203 --> 17:00.004
Congratulations, Neil.

17:00.072 --> 17:02.073
You have earned
your yellow cord.

17:08.346 --> 17:10.280
Tina, you're next.

17:10.348 --> 17:14.885
All right! Go, Tina!
You're doing great.

17:14.953 --> 17:16.920
Hyah! Sa!

17:16.988 --> 17:18.888
- Hyah!
- Mm. Mm.

17:18.957 --> 17:20.289
So glad you came, Bobby.

17:20.357 --> 17:22.157
She looks like she's
having a good time.

17:22.226 --> 17:23.960
- Sa! Sha!
- Mm. Mm.

17:24.027 --> 17:26.095
- Hyah! Brazil!
- Mm!

17:26.163 --> 17:29.132
Thank you.
The test is complete.

17:29.199 --> 17:33.335
I'm sorry, Tina, but you have failed.
Have a seat.

17:33.403 --> 17:36.437
The next student testing
for her yellow corda is janelle.

17:36.505 --> 17:38.907
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.977
Please do not interrupt
the ceremony, Bob.

17:42.044 --> 17:43.429
Just give her the stupid cord.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.913
Can't you see how much
this means to her?

17:44.981 --> 17:48.249
I'm sorry, Bob, but she did not
perform the 5 elementary motions,

17:48.317 --> 17:50.719
so she will not be
receiving her yellow corda.

17:50.787 --> 17:52.587
What? She did better than Neil.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.788
That kid was a mess out there.

17:53.855 --> 17:54.922
What? Hey!

17:54.990 --> 17:56.119
Oh, you know it's true.

17:56.239 --> 18:00.461
Tina did all 5 of the elementary
weird motions, I think.

18:00.528 --> 18:03.464
She did that one.
She did that one a lot.

18:03.531 --> 18:07.534
Is this because I made you
poop your pantalones?

18:07.602 --> 18:09.903
This isn't about me.
It's about Tina.

18:09.971 --> 18:12.338
Oh, is that what you think?

18:12.406 --> 18:14.074
All right. That's it.
I'm taking a corda.

18:14.141 --> 18:16.743
- Ow!
- Don't touch.

18:16.811 --> 18:18.478
- Ponytail!
- Stop that.

18:18.545 --> 18:20.847
Make me.

18:20.915 --> 18:23.449

18:23.517 --> 18:24.750
Nose bone!

18:24.818 --> 18:26.585
Nose bone into the brain
and skin him

18:26.653 --> 18:28.053
and wear him like a costume.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.722
All right, Louise. All right.

18:29.789 --> 18:30.689
All right. Here we go.

18:30.757 --> 18:31.857
Bobby, don't do this.

18:31.925 --> 18:33.659
I have to stand up for Tina.

18:33.727 --> 18:34.994
But, Bob, look at the clock.

18:35.061 --> 18:38.030
- It's 4:28.
- I know, Lin.

18:38.098 --> 18:40.732
I know, and if I poop, I poop.

18:40.799 --> 18:42.033

19:41.591 --> 19:44.125

- Thanks.

19:50.165 --> 19:51.832
Sorry jairo knocked you down

19:51.900 --> 19:54.735
25 to 30 times in
front of everyone.

19:54.803 --> 19:57.771
Yeah. Sorry I couldn't
get your yellow corda.

19:57.839 --> 20:00.507
It's ok. Thanks for
getting beat up for me.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.576
Anyway, I'm kind of
interested in russian

20:02.643 --> 20:04.411
kettleball strength
training now.

20:04.478 --> 20:05.978
Don't make me watch this
because I...

20:06.046 --> 20:07.847
- I'll show mom.
- Yeah.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.482
Well, I have
a surprise for you.

20:09.550 --> 20:10.850
- You got a promotion.
- Really?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.819
- I get a raise?
- No...

20:12.886 --> 20:14.254
But you get these
yellow dish gloves.

20:14.322 --> 20:17.155
I present to you
your yellow gloves.

20:17.224 --> 20:20.492
So much fun.
Well, we better get going.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.529
Yeah. That dead seal down
at the pier isn't gonna poke itself.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.698
Wait, wait. Hold on.
You two are working today.

20:25.765 --> 20:27.999
What? We're not
on the schedule today.

20:28.067 --> 20:31.437
Read. Learn how to read
the schedule that you write.

20:31.504 --> 20:33.971
Tina, honey, we're
giving you the day off.

20:34.039 --> 20:35.773
Go do something fun.

20:35.841 --> 20:37.942
Do you know where this dead seal is?
What's that about?

20:38.009 --> 20:39.877
Its a dead seal, mom. It's...

20:39.945 --> 20:41.045
a washed-up seal.

20:41.113 --> 20:42.113
They go poke at it.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.581
And we're gonna slap it.

20:43.649 --> 20:44.716
It makes a great sound.

20:44.783 --> 20:46.884
Then I sample the slaps.
Sounds like an orgy.

20:46.952 --> 20:48.452
I like dead seals,

20:48.519 --> 20:50.621
but I think I'm gonna
stay here instead.

20:50.688 --> 20:52.822
I'm actually having
fun at work today.

20:52.890 --> 20:54.958
- Besides, it's our father-daughter time.
- Aww!

20:55.025 --> 20:57.794
- Sucker!
- Gene, run.

20:57.862 --> 21:01.131
Run, run, run, run,
run to the seal!
