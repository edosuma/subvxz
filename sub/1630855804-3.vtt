16:07.208 --> 16:08.916
Across the ocean.

16:09.541 --> 16:11.833
She will conquer Europe first,

16:12.416 --> 16:14.708
unless we stop her.

16:21.791 --> 16:22.666
[music fades]

16:23.416 --> 16:24.875
I have to go to France.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.625
Then I'm coming with you.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.291
He'll be waiting when I get back.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.250
Warriors in arms, Annette.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.416
Family in hearts.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.208
[Annette] He was so brave,

16:46.833 --> 16:48.666
so committed to our freedom.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.250
We'll avenge him.

16:52.416 --> 16:53.583
I swear.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.458
[mysterious music playing]

17:04.875 --> 17:06.625
-[music continues]
-[blade whirling]

17:28.083 --> 17:30.083
[music fades]

17:31.750 --> 17:32.583
[Mizrak grunts]

17:33.833 --> 17:36.416
Who the fuck are you,
and what do you want?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.166
[grunts, gasps]

17:40.250 --> 17:44.500
Why is your Abbot forging night creatures
for the Vampire Messiah?

17:47.208 --> 17:49.708
It doesn't sit well with your faith.

17:49.791 --> 17:51.916
What do you know about faith?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.125
[grunts]

17:53.208 --> 17:54.833
Faith is a foundation.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.041
Faith is order.

17:57.791 --> 18:01.750
"When you walk through fire, you shall not
be burned, nor will flames consume you."

18:01.833 --> 18:03.708
Isaiah, 43:2.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.916
Faith is a companion
in the hardest of times.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.166
When the world abandons you.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.625
Oh. Has the world abandoned you, Mizrak?

18:16.250 --> 18:19.208
You know my name, tell me yours.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.666
The revolution's forcing everyone
to choose sides.

18:23.916 --> 18:27.541
Clergyman who don't profess loyalty
to the state are being guillotined.

18:27.625 --> 18:31.208
And you'd rather be loyal
to Erzsebet Bathory?

18:31.291 --> 18:33.916
-[ominous music playing]
-Do you have any idea who she is?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.916
What she's capable of?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.458
[Mizrak groans, grunts]

18:37.541 --> 18:38.958
[grunts, pants]

18:39.041 --> 18:44.416
The moment she doesn't need you,
she'll turn on you and murder you, slowly,

18:44.500 --> 18:45.916
one by one.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.541
[scoffs, chuckles]

18:48.625 --> 18:52.333
You expect me
to believe you care, vampire?

18:53.791 --> 18:57.458
Let's do this again,
somewhere more comfortable.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.875
My name is Olrox, by the way.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.000
[music fades]

19:05.083 --> 19:07.666
[intriguing music playing]

19:31.416 --> 19:34.000
[Erzsebet] Is everything ready
in Machecoul?

19:34.083 --> 19:36.458
Devotees are filling the château.

19:36.541 --> 19:38.833
The Marquis is excited to meet you,

19:38.916 --> 19:41.333
and I'm meeting the Forgemaster tomorrow.

19:41.833 --> 19:42.875
[Erzsebet] Mm.

19:43.875 --> 19:49.250
I dreamt last night
about the world we are making.

19:49.916 --> 19:54.583
The Empress of Russia,
the Holy Roman Emperor,

19:54.666 --> 20:00.291
the Ottoman Sultan, the Pope,
all kneeling before me,

20:00.375 --> 20:02.583
kissing my feet.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.375
[moans] It was such a beautiful dream.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.291
They're all going to kneel, Countess.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.541
Every single one.

20:13.791 --> 20:17.250
We've all heard about the slave uprising
in Saint-Domingue.

20:18.041 --> 20:21.791
Tonight, we've got someone
who took part in it.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.291
A great revolutionary leader.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.833
I give you Annette.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.041
They're going to love you.

20:39.541 --> 20:43.875
Egun mojuba. Ancestors, I give respect.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.041
I am not a revolutionary leader.

20:49.916 --> 20:55.458
I am a girl who used to be a slave
until slavery could be endured no longer.

20:57.166 --> 21:02.125
This revolution,
it speaks of something it calls reason,

21:02.916 --> 21:05.875
but only God can save your souls.

21:06.708 --> 21:11.125
We lit a spark, a few of us at first
hiding in the mountains,

21:11.208 --> 21:14.791
but the sugar and tobacco fields
had dried out in the sun,

21:14.875 --> 21:19.125
and the spark lit a flame,
and then the flame was an inferno,

21:19.208 --> 21:23.208
and all their power and cruelty
crumbled before us.

21:23.291 --> 21:26.583
-[people cheering]
-Liberty, equality, fraternity!

21:27.750 --> 21:29.500
They burn Catholic churches

21:29.583 --> 21:32.416
and destroy statues
of Mary and the saints,

21:32.500 --> 21:34.958
and call it reason.

21:35.041 --> 21:37.791
I call it the work of the devil.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.666
-[roars]
-[dramatic music playing]

21:47.666 --> 21:50.458
It's all right, stay in your seats.

21:51.041 --> 21:52.000
We're safe.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.958
God will protect us.

21:55.458 --> 21:57.416
-[exciting music playing]
-[snarling]

21:59.416 --> 22:01.416
Split up. Clear pathways.

22:04.416 --> 22:05.750

-[gasps]

22:07.208 --> 22:08.250

[Richter grunts]

22:17.083 --> 22:18.291
[whip cracks]

22:21.791 --> 22:23.041
[screeching]

22:25.541 --> 22:26.583
Go!

22:27.500 --> 22:28.541
[roars]

22:33.833 --> 22:35.916
[snarling]

22:38.666 --> 22:39.583

[growls]

23:36.000 --> 23:37.833
[music fades]

23:37.916 --> 23:39.916
What the fuck just happened?

23:40.791 --> 23:41.708
It was Edouard.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.333
I saw his eyes.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.875
What? What do you mean?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.125
-He's dead.
-[sobbing softly]

23:51.583 --> 23:54.291
-They're going to the abbey.
-[Annette sobbing]

23:54.375 --> 23:56.375
[sad, ethereal music playing]

23:58.041 --> 23:59.375
He's a night creature.

24:00.791 --> 24:03.625
My sweet, beautiful Edouard
has been turned into a monster

24:03.708 --> 24:04.875
conjured from hell.

24:10.083 --> 24:12.291
[music fades]

24:16.125 --> 24:18.875
[gentle, ethereal music playing]
