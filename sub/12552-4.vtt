00:10.677 --> 00:14.114
<i>There's an extraterrestrial</i>

-RANI: My name is Rani.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.838
Rani Chandra.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.573
I'm Adam.
I want to know who you are.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.876
This old attic
is full of ghosts.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.144
Ghosts of the people
I used to love.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.312
When I was a girl,

00:46.379 --> 00:48.615
I wanted to be a journalist.

00:48.681 --> 00:51.418
RANI: <i>One morning</i>
<i>I found something</i>
<i>that I thought could be...</i>

00:51.484 --> 00:52.819
Totally worth investigating.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.587
-Rani...
-A spaceship...

00:54.788 --> 00:56.956
Rani! It was lightning.
Mr Smith checked it
out this morning.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.159
<i>So that morning,</i>
<i>it just felt like I</i>
<i>wasn't one of the gang.</i>

00:59.225 --> 01:00.427
Oh. Right.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.262
<i>And I was annoyed</i>
<i>with Sarah Jane</i>

01:02.328 --> 01:03.496
<i>because it was like</i>
<i>she hadn't taken</i>
<i>me seriously.</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:05.865
<i>-Then I got an e-mail.</i>
-(E-MAIL PINGS)

01:05.932 --> 01:09.536
<i>Samuel Lloyd.</i>
<i>We were best friends</i>

01:09.602 --> 01:12.505
<i>But that Saturday, out of</i>
<i>the blue, he e-mailed me.</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:14.974
<i>He'd found something</i>
<i>suspicious which he wanted</i>
<i>me to investigate.</i>

01:15.041 --> 01:16.409
SAMUEL: A red demon.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.912
He said it was like fire,
you know? Living fire.

<i>Currently resides in</i>

Rani's been
telling this boy
about everything we do!

01:33.359 --> 01:34.427
Hello?

01:34.494 --> 01:36.029
Can you hear me?

01:36.095 --> 01:37.697
I thought I could trust her.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.798
She's with her.

SAMUEL: The demon.

-I can see your past.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

01:43.970 --> 01:45.572
Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde

01:45.638 --> 01:46.706
have been trying
to contact you.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.174
I don't need them.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.642
I wish they'd just
leave me alone.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.047
<i>I wish to know who</i>
<i>Sarah Jane Smith is.</i>

01:56.282 --> 01:58.718

EVE: <i>Do you want</i>
<i>to see your future?</i>

02:00.086 --> 02:02.288
My name is Rani.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.958
Please! No.
I can't become that!

02:24.944 --> 02:27.714
They read our timelines.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.116
<i>Ship showed Luke his past.</i>

02:30.183 --> 02:31.718
SARAH JANE:
All he needs now is a name.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.786
-I like Luke.
-I like Luke.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.855
I'm going to miss you so much.

02:35.922 --> 02:36.956
RANI: <i>And then his future.</i>

<i>-The darkness.</i>
-What?

02:42.295 --> 02:43.997
<i>The things she's seen.</i>

RANI: <i>She showed</i>

<i>He is coming back.</i>

03:08.521 --> 03:10.156
What happened?
What did that thing do to her?

03:12.292 --> 03:14.661
<i>-Bring her back!</i>
-Oh, I don't think so.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.463
<i>The darkness!</i>
<i>I saw it in her mind.</i>

(THUNDER CRACKING)

03:23.503 --> 03:24.504
EVE: Rani?

03:24.571 --> 03:27.273
Why did you show me that?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.175
EVE: I thought it would stop
the confusion in your head

03:29.242 --> 03:32.211
about your mum
and GCSEs and boys and...

03:33.846 --> 03:36.416
I'm going to end up like that?

03:36.482 --> 03:38.918
An old woman? Alone?

03:39.986 --> 03:41.454
I could feel it. I was...

03:41.654 --> 03:42.922
So lonely.

03:44.490 --> 03:45.592
I saw this.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.461
I saw this future. My future.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.596
And I told myself, I...

03:49.662 --> 03:51.064
Won't let that happen!

03:51.130 --> 03:54.167
Whatever I do,
I won't become...

03:54.233 --> 03:56.603
Like that!
I'm not going to be alone.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.540
But it happened.

04:02.475 --> 04:03.676
How?

04:04.477 --> 04:06.179
Because of what I did.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.988
(SNIFFLES) Right.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.689
We're not staying here.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.057
You're not staying here.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.026
Look at me, Rani.
I can't go outside!

04:20.959 --> 04:22.295
You can

04:22.362 --> 04:24.030
and you're going to.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.932
We're going to
find your spaceship
and you're going home!

04:29.836 --> 04:31.904
What just happened?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.006
Calling Mummy?

04:35.842 --> 04:38.144
Don't you think
that was a bit weird?

04:38.211 --> 04:39.212
You're the weird one.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.747
-You're not even human.
-I am.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.249
I saw you.
You were made.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.586
-Like Frankenstein.
-Actually, I'm more
like the creature.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.988
Frankenstein
was the name of the man
who made the creature.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.860
Rani said you were clever.

04:56.696 --> 04:59.132
She said a few things
about you as well.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.334
What do you mean?

05:01.401 --> 05:03.736
She was really upset
when you started ignoring her.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.038
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.174
She was too busy to be upset.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.177
She kept going on about
you and Clyde and Sarah Jane

05:12.345 --> 05:14.013
and space and Sontarans.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.015
I was stuck here. By myself.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.951
I couldn't listen
to it any more.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.453
Rani told you
about what we do.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.188
Do you know how big that is?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.489
That's breaking every rule.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.228
You tricked her
into coming here.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.064
I didn't trick her.
I asked her to come.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.900
Why? Because someone
saw something in a theme park?

05:33.966 --> 05:35.935
You'd been ignoring
her for months.

05:37.770 --> 05:38.771
I was scared.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.773
It was you, wasn't it?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.076
You went into the park.
You met the demon.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.210
She's not a demon.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.945
She's called Eve,
she's my friend.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.716
She... She read my mind

05:49.782 --> 05:52.018
and because
I knew about Rani
meeting aliens and that,

05:53.453 --> 05:54.587
Eve knew.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.556
So she wanted you
to bring Rani here?

05:57.924 --> 05:59.425
Eve won't hurt her.

05:59.492 --> 06:00.927
Do you know that for sure?

06:05.898 --> 06:07.700
CLYDE: What do you mean,
you saw your future?

06:07.767 --> 06:08.901
(CLYDE PANTING)

06:08.968 --> 06:12.071
I saw the TARDIS.
In the attic.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.341
Sarah Jane, look at me! Okay.

06:15.408 --> 06:18.911
That face in the mirror,
it's dangerous.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.514
Okay? Rani's here somewhere
and we have to find her.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.449
You're right. Sorry, come on.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.151
(GHOULISH LAUGHTER)

06:25.218 --> 06:27.220
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:27.286 --> 06:28.921
The park's been closed
for months.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.157
Harry seems
like an organised kind of guy.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.693
So why's the door
to the Haunted Mine open?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.695
Sometimes,
I think we're too good.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.431
Yes.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.900
I just hope there are
no nasty surprises inside.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.169
For a change.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.304
Do you know
where your ship crashed?

06:45.371 --> 06:47.774
Harry said
he found me on the beach.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.942
And he says
it's not safe outside?

06:50.009 --> 06:52.612
I guess he meant
people would think I'm weird.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.549
It had to be a haunted mine,
didn't it?

06:56.616 --> 06:58.551
You're not scared, are you?

06:58.618 --> 07:00.953
Me Clyde. Me not get scared.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.889
-After everything you've seen?
-(EERIE WAILING)

07:02.955 --> 07:03.923

-Me? Nah!

07:08.961 --> 07:10.963
(DEEP EERIE LAUGHTER)

07:13.766 --> 07:15.735
EVE: So humans
like being scared?

07:15.802 --> 07:17.470
Well, no. Sort of.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.138
It's difficult to explain.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.407
The universe
is full of nightmares

07:21.474 --> 07:22.608
and you make fake ones.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.143
Yeah. We're weird.

07:25.344 --> 07:26.846
(SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)

07:31.651 --> 07:33.519
What is it?

07:33.586 --> 07:34.921
I don't know.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.489
Did you hear something?

07:43.162 --> 07:44.931
(SCREAMING)

07:49.502 --> 07:51.537
-I feel a bit stupid now.
-Where have you been?

07:51.604 --> 07:52.872
We've been trying to call you!

07:52.939 --> 07:53.973
You could have
been lying in a ditch. Or...

07:56.776 --> 07:58.611
Ahem. Yes,
it's good to see you
though, mate.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.647
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

08:01.714 --> 08:02.882
Yeah, this is Eve.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.153
It's okay. She's not
trying to take over
the world or anything!

08:07.220 --> 08:08.688
Are you sure about that?

08:08.754 --> 08:10.957
Because there's a mirror out
there that can read minds.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.959
And not forgetting
the red-eyed zombies.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.127
She only wants
to make them happy.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.163
Oh, Rani,
you haven't got a clue
what we're dealing with!

08:19.599 --> 08:22.835
No, 'cause I'm just
a stupid kid who
never gets anything right!

08:26.138 --> 08:27.940
They didn't have cups, so...

08:43.522 --> 08:44.624
Rani!

08:44.690 --> 08:46.993
(MOBILE RINGING)

08:47.059 --> 08:49.862
-Luke?
<i>-It's Sam. He's disappeared.</i>

08:49.929 --> 08:51.497
He told me about
someone called Eve.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.633
And there was
a face in his mirror.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.935
Mum, he showed me my future!

08:57.570 --> 08:59.038
Are you okay?

08:59.105 --> 09:01.307
-I'm fine.
<i>-Right, stay there.</i>

09:01.374 --> 09:03.943
Check his computer,
go through his email.
I'll call you later.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.616
Rani.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.618
That mirror,
or whatever it was,
it's powerful.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.020
It read my mind.

09:14.086 --> 09:17.757
And it read Luke's, too.
It told us our future.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.593
But nothing
can know the future.
We can change it.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.194
It's up to us what we do,
isn't it?

09:22.261 --> 09:23.930
EVE: Oh, it's beautiful.

09:24.597 --> 09:25.731
Oh, the wind!

09:25.798 --> 09:27.767
The air! Oh, Rani!

09:27.833 --> 09:29.835
-Eve.
-I want to play!

09:29.902 --> 09:31.037
(LAUGHS)

09:31.904 --> 09:32.939
Oh, yes!

(LAUGHS)

09:38.411 --> 09:40.079
EVE: Oh, this is wonderful.

09:42.481 --> 09:43.716
(EVE LAUGHING)

09:43.783 --> 09:45.184
Eve, listen to me!

09:45.251 --> 09:47.386
You've got to stop this!

09:47.453 --> 09:48.955
SARAH JANE:
She's controlling the rides.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.626
Eve! What's going on?

09:53.693 --> 09:55.695
-(EVE LAUGHING)
-What are you doing out here?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.330
It's not safe! I've told you!

09:57.396 --> 09:59.265
You've got
to let these people go!

09:59.332 --> 10:00.833
(LAUGHING)

10:06.806 --> 10:07.940
CLYDE: They're getting faster.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.047
HARRY: Eve! Listen to me!

10:15.114 --> 10:16.816
You can't tell me what to do.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.184
Rani brought me outside.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.519
Come on. The mirror.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.599
Mirror?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.435
Can you hear me?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.106
<i>What is your wish?</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:42.174
We'd like to know
what's going on.

10:42.608 --> 10:43.843
<i>Eve!</i>

10:44.677 --> 10:46.212
<i>Eve is outside.</i>

10:46.278 --> 10:49.482
<i>She must stop!</i>
<i>Playtime is over.</i>

11:00.526 --> 11:03.262
Eve! Stop it!
You can't control
people like this.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.099
Please, sweetheart,
come inside. Please!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.502
Right. Suit yourself.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.537
Rani?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.539
I thought we were friends.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.341
We are!

11:15.408 --> 11:17.410
No, you just want friends
who do whatever
you tell them to.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.779
Don't go!
You can't leave me!

11:19.845 --> 11:22.915
-I can.
-Oh, no, really, you can't.

<i>You must bring her to me.</i>

11:33.325 --> 11:36.128
<i>She's too young.</i>
<i>She cannot control her powers.</i>

11:36.195 --> 11:37.963
-Who are you?
<i>-I am Ship.</i>

11:38.164 --> 11:40.332
-Eve's spaceship?
<i>-Yes.</i>

11:40.399 --> 11:42.868
<i>My primary function</i>
<i>is to keep Eve safe.</i>

11:42.935 --> 11:44.570
So why did you
let Harry take her?

11:44.637 --> 11:46.338
<i>Harry keeps her safe.</i>

11:46.405 --> 11:48.607
<i>I needed to reboot.</i>
<i>After the crash.</i>

11:48.674 --> 11:50.576
<i>Playtime keeps her occupied.</i>

11:50.643 --> 11:54.146
-And how are you now?
<i>-I am at 87%.</i>

11:54.213 --> 11:55.848
<i>She must stop playing.</i>

11:55.915 --> 11:57.016
<i>She will die.</i>

12:00.619 --> 12:01.754
Eve?

12:01.821 --> 12:03.055
What's going on?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.056
Rani, I'm sorry.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.164
Rani?

12:13.966 --> 12:15.301
What have you done to her?

12:15.367 --> 12:16.902
EVE: She was scared
of the future.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.305
Scared of growing old.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.474
Now she'll be young
and happy forever.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.945
(SCREAMING)

12:26.779 --> 12:28.747

SHIP: <i>She's trying</i>
<i>to control too much.</i>

12:31.650 --> 12:34.453
<i>She has not been taught</i>
<i>how to use her powers.</i>

12:35.254 --> 12:37.456
<i>She is a child</i>

12:37.523 --> 12:40.893
<i>trying to be an adult,</i>
<i>and it will burn her mind!</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:42.328
-Ah!
-Eve.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.830
Please, sweetheart,
please stop this.

12:44.897 --> 12:45.898
You're making yourself ill.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.633
What's happening to me?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.269
The power in you,
it's too much for you
to cope with.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.971
What have you done to her?

12:52.037 --> 12:54.773
-Let her go!
-No! I don't want
to be lonely.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.375
You won't be! You've got me!

12:56.442 --> 12:57.943
Eve, you've got
to let them go!

13:01.080 --> 13:03.449
My parents died. So did Sam's.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.251
And Clyde's dad
walked out on him.

13:05.317 --> 13:06.719
Life isn't easy, Eve,

13:06.785 --> 13:08.587
but none of it means
you've got to be alone.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.189
You need friends.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.490
Real friends.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.526
Not people you're forcing
to stay with you.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.495
Harry? What should I do?

13:16.562 --> 13:18.063
Stop this.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.498
Let them go. It'll be fine.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.169
Playtime is over.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.637
Rani?

13:24.703 --> 13:26.639
I can't! I can't do it!

13:26.705 --> 13:28.174
-You have to!
-I can't.

13:29.775 --> 13:30.876
I don't know how.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.513
Ah!

13:36.048 --> 13:38.384
What about Ship?
Why couldn't she stop it?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.886
Only if they took Eve to her.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.155
<i>They took her back</i>
<i>to the beach.</i>

13:43.222 --> 13:44.456
Do you know
where your ship is?

13:45.925 --> 13:48.460
Eve, can you sense it?

13:48.527 --> 13:51.664
Yeah. It's... It's here.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.666
Have you found it?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.100
Wait.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.703
I can feel it. It...

13:59.405 --> 14:00.839
I can feel her.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.915
CLYDE: Whoa. Stand back!

14:11.984 --> 14:12.918
That's a spaceship?

14:39.612 --> 14:41.213
<i>I am glad you are safe, Eve.</i>

14:42.014 --> 14:43.249
Please, Ship.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.085
My head hurts.
I want this to stop.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.021
I want my friends to be free.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.056
<i>Place your hands on the core.</i>

-Where is everyone?
-They've gone to the
beach to find Eve's ship.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.518
Come on!

15:53.585 --> 15:55.287
(SOFTLY) Oh, no.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.522
Eve needs you.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.464
I've got to go.
Help yourselves to anything.

16:11.337 --> 16:14.106
SARAH JANE:
Ship was boosting
Eve's energy.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.675
And now it's
taking it back.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.682
I'm fine. I'm fine.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.423
<i>It is good to meet you.</i>

16:31.490 --> 16:34.793
Ship, Eve's not going
to be safe here on Earth.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.462
Not everyone's
like Harry and Sam.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.264
SHIP: <i>That's why I needed you.</i>

16:39.331 --> 16:41.567
<i>-The darkness.</i>
-What do you mean?

16:41.633 --> 16:43.569
<i>The darkness is our fuel.</i>

16:43.635 --> 16:45.304
<i>I saw it in your mind.</i>

<i>Black, black...</i>

16:47.339 --> 16:49.808
<i>I think you call</i>
<i>it a black hole.</i>

16:49.875 --> 16:52.411
-A black hole?
<i>-My engines use them for fuel.</i>

16:52.478 --> 16:53.579
A black hole!

16:53.645 --> 16:54.913
Oh. Easy.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.184
Mr Smith, I need you!

16:59.251 --> 17:00.586
<i>Yes, Sarah Jane?</i>

up by a black hole.

a black hole.

I am so sorry.

You were in London,

19:24.763 --> 19:28.133
seemed like you were having
such a cool time
and I was stuck here.

I think they're going
to be fantastic.
Come on.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.864
Wait for me.

23:22.534 --> 23:23.635
<i>Prepare for take-off.</i>

23:26.037 --> 23:28.507
It was quite big down there.
Shouldn't we move back?

23:28.573 --> 23:30.509
(RUMBLING)

23:30.575 --> 23:31.643
Oh!

23:58.570 --> 23:59.938
-That is...
-Amazing.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.307
Thank you.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.876
Thank you so much for
sharing this with me.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.812
And I'm sorry
for coming here alone.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.682
And I'm so sorry
for telling Sam
about what we do.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.920
No, Rani.
I'm sorry.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.022
What for?

24:18.023 --> 24:20.158
Maybe you
were right to tell Sam.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.426
I've spent
so many years alone,

24:21.493 --> 24:24.963
I still find it
difficult to trust people.

24:25.163 --> 24:29.434
But, you know,
they're not all out to get us
and sometimes I forget that.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.970
Sometimes visitors
to this world
just need a friend.

24:33.371 --> 24:34.573
Come on.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.807
Let's go.

24:44.516 --> 24:46.651
<i>Mistress arrival detected.</i>

24:48.320 --> 24:50.689
K9, my man! How are you doing?

24:50.755 --> 24:52.791
<i>I'm doing well,</i>
<i>Master Clyde.</i>

24:52.858 --> 24:54.860
SARAH JANE: Oh,
welcome home, K9.

24:54.926 --> 24:56.061
Come on, everyone,
group photo.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.863
Oh, use mine,
it's got a timer.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.698
Gadget boy. Put it there.

25:02.567 --> 25:03.902
-You all right?
-Yeah.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.238
Eve showed me my future

25:06.304 --> 25:08.006
but I'm not going
to worry about it.

25:08.073 --> 25:09.608
Here and now,
that's what matters.

25:09.674 --> 25:10.909
That's right.

25:10.976 --> 25:11.943
CLYDE: Come on.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.014
We'll face
the future together.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.050
SHIP: <i>He is coming back.</i>

25:22.921 --> 25:23.922
LUKE: Come on,
Mum, in you get.

25:25.457 --> 25:27.592
Yeah.
(LAUGHING)

25:27.659 --> 25:29.594
-All right.
-K9, say, "Cheese."

25:29.661 --> 25:30.962
-He can't say cheese.
-Yes, he can.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.698
<i>Cheese!</i>
<i>Fermented curds.</i>

25:34.599 --> 25:36.768
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

25:36.835 --> 25:38.770
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

25:51.850 --> 25:52.851
Grandma Rani!

25:52.918 --> 25:55.153
-Ah, babies!
-You all right, Mum?

25:56.121 --> 25:57.422
How was Washington?

25:57.489 --> 25:59.858
Oh, it was good.

25:59.925 --> 26:02.494
Hmm. Luke and I
caught up with Maria.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.795
(SOFTLY)
Oh, I missed you lots.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.264
Hmm.

26:06.331 --> 26:10.068
Oh, all right, all right,
calm down.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.570
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

26:12.637 --> 26:13.939
Come on,
go and play on the computer.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.756
She's off again.

26:32.891 --> 26:33.992
Right, we're coming over.

26:34.059 --> 26:35.260
Why's she lying to us?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.495
His name is Peter Dalton.

26:37.562 --> 26:38.730
We're getting married.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.131
What am
I supposed to call him?

26:40.198 --> 26:41.566
Dad?

26:41.633 --> 26:43.535
Oh, Clyde,
Peter is not an alien.

26:46.171 --> 26:48.340
SARAH JANE: I've made
you all so suspicious.

26:48.406 --> 26:51.176
But this is a happy thing,
and I want you all
to be part of it.

26:56.481 --> 26:57.716
Sarah!
