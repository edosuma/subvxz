WEBVTT

00:11.497 --> 00:15.232
Can you tell me about the day
that Mo Williams was murdered?

00:15.531 --> 00:17.118
Well, first,
I heard the gunshot.

00:17.119 --> 00:18.140
And what did you do?

00:18.141 --> 00:19.394
I looked out my peephole

00:19.395 --> 00:21.921
and I saw Hiram Diaz
standing in front of Mo.

00:21.923 --> 00:23.155
And there was another
dude out there, too,

00:23.157 --> 00:24.724
but I couldn't
see his face.

00:24.726 --> 00:25.925
What was Mr. Diaz doing?

00:25.927 --> 00:27.994
You want me to say
he was holding a gun, right?

00:27.996 --> 00:30.329
Miranda, I told you, I just
want you to tell the truth.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.765
He shot Mo in the chest
with a .38.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.734
How did you know
the gun was a .38?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.202
'Cause I got the same gun.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.938
Do you have a permit for that?

00:39.940 --> 00:42.041
Come 8:00 at night, Hiram and
the rest of the Double Treys

00:42.043 --> 00:43.509
shut the elevators down.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.078
They deal crack right out in the
open like they delivering pizza.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.914
You gonna stand there and tell
me you wouldn't carry a gun too,

00:48.916 --> 00:51.750
Miss It Ain't Like That
On Park Avenue?

00:51.752 --> 00:52.984
One, I don't live
on Park Avenue.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.020
Two, you announce that
in open court,

00:55.022 --> 00:58.289
you will be arrested for
criminal possession of a weapon.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.458
Okay, I'm gonna shut up now.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.760
Why don't we take a break

01:01.762 --> 01:03.562
and finish this
when we all come back.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.296
Good, I'm starving.

01:10.303 --> 01:13.037
Will you go back to the scene
and find me something--

01:13.039 --> 01:15.373
and I mean anything--
because her testimony

01:15.375 --> 01:17.608
is not gonna be enough
to convict Diaz.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.610
You think?

01:23.950 --> 01:25.215
Sir.

01:25.217 --> 01:26.917
How you feeling, Baker?

01:26.919 --> 01:28.518
I'm fine, sir.

01:30.122 --> 01:32.022
Why are you
lurking by the elevator?

01:32.024 --> 01:33.256
I'm not lurking.
You lurking

01:33.258 --> 01:36.193
always means bad news
or a plea to keep my mouth shut.

01:36.195 --> 01:39.429
Mr. Lewis from the attorney
general's office is here, sir.

01:40.299 --> 01:41.631
He's already here?

01:44.303 --> 01:45.535
Where?

01:45.537 --> 01:46.803
Waiting in your office.

01:46.805 --> 01:49.806
He needed to speak to the
governor and wanted a hard line.

01:51.610 --> 01:53.276
From my office?

01:53.278 --> 01:54.677
Since when do we do that?

01:54.679 --> 01:56.646
We extended the courtesy.

01:56.648 --> 01:57.914
We?

02:01.219 --> 02:03.086
No problem.
I'll make sure

02:03.088 --> 02:05.021
he's aware that's on
the table as well.

02:05.023 --> 02:06.422
I'm gonna get into
it with him now.

02:06.424 --> 02:08.424
If that's the governor,
say hey for me.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.994
He just stepped in;
he sends his best.

02:10.996 --> 02:13.329
Okay, I'll call you after.

02:13.331 --> 02:14.696
Commissioner.

02:14.698 --> 02:18.601
If you need to make another
phone call, I can wait outside.

02:18.603 --> 02:20.636
No. No, no, no,
no. But, um...

02:20.638 --> 02:22.838
just us, please.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.840
He stays.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.410
So?
Thank you for seeing me.

02:28.412 --> 02:31.013
You're welcome.
I'm here as a courtesy.

02:31.015 --> 02:33.314
Holding the door is a courtesy;
letting you in here

02:33.316 --> 02:34.850
to use my phone,
that's a courtesy;

02:34.852 --> 02:36.351
but launching
another investigation

02:36.353 --> 02:40.421
into my department--
not so much.

02:41.659 --> 02:42.918
What he means is...

02:42.919 --> 02:45.093
What I mean is
let's show each other

02:45.095 --> 02:48.229
the genuine courtesy
of full transparency.

02:49.599 --> 02:53.368
We are opening an investigation
into the NYPD's use of force,

02:53.370 --> 02:56.171
particularly as it pertains
to police actions

02:56.173 --> 02:58.506
in minority neighborhoods.

02:59.676 --> 03:03.044
Well, there you go.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

03:03.046 --> 03:04.945
I'd appreciate it,
as a courtesy,

03:04.947 --> 03:06.781
if you'd dial down the attitude.

03:06.783 --> 03:09.784
I am here with the full
confidence of the governor.

03:09.786 --> 03:12.586
Duly noted.

03:12.588 --> 03:16.691
This is a copy of our annual
firearms discharge report.

03:16.693 --> 03:19.859
It is a deep dive
into the use of firearms

03:19.861 --> 03:22.229
by every member
of this department

03:22.231 --> 03:24.565
and all accompanying statistics.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.099
Thank you for this.

03:26.101 --> 03:27.634
You're welcome.
But I didn't come down here

03:27.636 --> 03:29.503
to pick up papers.

03:29.505 --> 03:33.106
We'd also like your
personal cooperation on this.

03:34.042 --> 03:35.375
Why?

03:35.377 --> 03:38.745
Well, the relationship between
the police and the public

03:38.747 --> 03:41.114
is a matter of discord
across the country.

03:41.116 --> 03:43.249
Now, the governor would
like to allay any fears

03:43.251 --> 03:46.285
or misconceptions that police
shootings in New York City

03:46.287 --> 03:48.321
may have bias elements.

03:48.323 --> 03:49.589
You don't need me.
It's all in there.

03:49.591 --> 03:51.591
Go crunch the numbers.
Being part of

03:51.593 --> 03:54.126
a public investigation
into NYPD shootings

03:54.128 --> 03:56.495
and their impact
on minority communities

03:56.497 --> 03:58.264
is a win for everyone involved.

03:58.266 --> 03:59.169
How's that?

03:59.193 --> 04:00.467
We complete our
investigation,

04:00.468 --> 04:03.035
we make our recommendations
to the mayor's office,

04:03.037 --> 04:05.838
to your office,
to the city council,

04:05.840 --> 04:08.574
and we all move on.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.811
No. You move on,

04:12.813 --> 04:16.180
pleased as punch with
your thousand-page report.

04:16.183 --> 04:19.584
I, on the other hand, am left
to deal with the fallout.

04:19.586 --> 04:22.120
If it's as you say,
why would there be fallout?

04:22.123 --> 04:24.223
Because that's the way
it works, and you know it.

04:24.225 --> 04:26.924
There has to be
fault found, Robert.

04:26.926 --> 04:31.129
And fallout, for your
investigation to earn its keep.

04:39.072 --> 04:41.339
Please tell me
you have something.

04:41.341 --> 04:44.175
I got a lot of charm, Erin,
but it ain't working today.

04:44.177 --> 04:46.644
Everyone's just too scared
to testify against Diaz?

04:46.646 --> 04:49.446
I wish. More like they're
too scared to talk to cops.

04:49.448 --> 04:51.149
But I got this.
What's that?

04:51.151 --> 04:53.785
The deli across from the
building has security cameras.

04:53.787 --> 04:56.788
I got what looks like Diaz
and an unidentified male

04:56.790 --> 04:58.756
leaving the premises
right after the murder.

04:58.758 --> 05:00.758
Before you get excited,

05:00.760 --> 05:02.626
it's as clear as
mud, but maybe...

05:02.628 --> 05:04.261
What the hell's going on here?

05:04.263 --> 05:05.239
Excuse me?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.298
What are you talking
about, Danny?

05:06.299 --> 05:08.231
Why the hell's
he poking around my case?

05:08.233 --> 05:09.433
It's a D.A.'s

05:09.435 --> 05:10.467
office case now.
Hey, I'm not

05:10.469 --> 05:11.902
talking to you,
I'm talking to her.

05:11.904 --> 05:14.405
You poach my case and you
don't even give me a heads up?

05:14.407 --> 05:16.406
I don't work for you!

05:16.408 --> 05:18.108
I don't give a damn
who you work for!

05:18.110 --> 05:19.575
You don't
cherry-pick my cases!

05:19.577 --> 05:22.212
Okay, guys,
both of you, stop it.

05:22.214 --> 05:23.646
I handed you an eyewitness.

05:23.648 --> 05:25.315
Do you know how difficult
that is in that neighborhood?

05:25.317 --> 05:27.784
And if I was trying this case
in Staten Island,

05:27.786 --> 05:29.385
I might get a conviction.

05:29.387 --> 05:31.188
But there is no way
that witness

05:31.190 --> 05:33.189
is going to sway
12 Manhattan jurors.

05:33.191 --> 05:34.791
Well, maybe you
should've asked me.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.927
Well, she asked me.
Same credentials as you.

05:37.929 --> 05:39.430
Good, then go find
your own case.

05:39.454 --> 05:40.331
I've got a guy

05:40.332 --> 05:41.798
who's gotten away with
a half dozen murders

05:41.800 --> 05:43.098
finally on trial.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.568
I'm not gonna lose it
because of your two egos.

05:45.570 --> 05:48.804
Now, my witness hasn't
answered a cell, a text

05:48.806 --> 05:51.373
or a e-mail--
nothing since she left here.

05:51.375 --> 05:54.143
Go find her and bring her back.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.074

06:03.387 --> 06:04.919
Eddie. Hey.

06:04.921 --> 06:05.854
Hey.

06:05.878 --> 06:06.656
I'm sorry I missed
you this morning.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.491
Uh, bacon, egg and cheese,
and a coffee, regular.

06:09.493 --> 06:10.759
That's what you like, right?

06:10.761 --> 06:13.662
Yes. Thank you.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.996
Oh, sorry.

06:14.998 --> 06:17.332
Uh, Josh,
this is my partner, Jamie.

06:17.334 --> 06:18.600
Jamie, this is,
uh, Josh.

06:18.602 --> 06:19.835
Nice to meet you.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.836
You're Jamie? Cool.

06:21.838 --> 06:23.938
It's good to finally
meet you, too.

06:25.375 --> 06:28.009
10-10, possible
jumper on the Queens-bound side

06:28.011 --> 06:30.511
of the Roosevelt Bridge.
Center span.

06:30.513 --> 06:32.213
Uh, 12 David responding.

06:32.215 --> 06:34.849
We got, we got to go. Sorry.

06:34.851 --> 06:36.084
Thank you.

06:36.086 --> 06:38.586
Don't forget Monday--
Bruce Springsteen.

06:39.589 --> 06:42.022
He's glad to <i>finally</i> meet me?

06:54.536 --> 06:55.936
I hate jumpers.

06:55.938 --> 06:58.005
Yeah, at
least if he jumps,

06:58.007 --> 06:59.306
it's in the East River.

06:59.308 --> 07:01.008
No splat.

07:01.010 --> 07:02.276
Exactly.

07:05.247 --> 07:07.247
I'm Jamie Reagan.
This is Eddie Janko.

07:07.249 --> 07:08.415
What's your name?

07:08.417 --> 07:10.517
Mike.

07:10.519 --> 07:11.453
Mike, what's going on,
Mike?

07:11.477 --> 07:12.653
Don't come any closer.

07:12.654 --> 07:15.388
Okay, hey... Whoa, whoa, Mike.
Hey, Mike, don't do that.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.557
Hey, I said don't come closer!
I'm not!

07:18.960 --> 07:20.460
Mike, don't do that.
I said don't come near me.

07:20.462 --> 07:22.929
Okay, I'm not.
We just want to be

07:22.931 --> 07:24.330
close enough to
hear each other.

07:25.901 --> 07:26.933
Anything?

07:26.935 --> 07:28.067
She still ain't
answering the phone.

07:28.069 --> 07:30.136
Her apartment's
around the corner.

07:30.138 --> 07:31.203
Maybe we'll get her there.

07:32.506 --> 07:34.740
Come on, move it!
Get out of the way, idiot!

07:34.742 --> 07:36.208
What's going on
over here?

07:36.210 --> 07:38.510
I don't know. Hey. Hey!

07:38.512 --> 07:40.746
Quiet down.
Come on, I got to go.

07:47.054 --> 07:49.254
Son of a bitch.

07:56.029 --> 07:57.463
Tell me you have her.

07:57.465 --> 07:58.630
Erin,

07:58.632 --> 08:00.398
good news and bad news.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.200
Good news is
we found the witness.

08:02.202 --> 08:05.136
Bad news is... she's dead.

08:38.506 --> 08:40.159
Mike, you want to tell us
why you're over there?

08:40.159 --> 08:41.009
Jennifer.

08:41.033 --> 08:43.544
Jennifer?
Is, uh, she your girlfriend?

08:43.645 --> 08:45.612
She <i>was</i> my girlfriend.

08:45.614 --> 08:48.648
She... was gonna be my wife.

08:51.853 --> 08:53.420
I mean,

08:53.422 --> 08:54.988
can you believe that?

08:54.990 --> 08:56.123
I'm sorry, Mike.

08:58.927 --> 09:00.226
Maybe she made a mistake.

09:00.228 --> 09:02.328
No. It wasn't a one-time thing.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.963
It was going on for months.

09:03.965 --> 09:05.197
Mike, hey,

09:05.199 --> 09:06.132
that's a permanent solution

09:06.134 --> 09:08.067
to a temporary problem.
Yeah, I know

09:08.069 --> 09:09.803
this is a permanent solution!

09:09.805 --> 09:12.004
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

09:12.006 --> 09:14.206
My point is things change
all the time, on a dime.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.408
Like she changes her mind?

09:15.410 --> 09:16.742
Or you meet someone even better.

09:16.744 --> 09:18.777
No, there is no one better.

09:18.779 --> 09:19.778
You don't know that.

09:19.780 --> 09:20.947
Neither do you.

09:20.949 --> 09:22.348
Mike, hey...

09:24.752 --> 09:27.519
Couple years back,
I was in your same position.

09:27.521 --> 09:29.755
I was engaged
and she broke it off.

09:29.757 --> 09:31.156
What, she dumped you?

09:31.158 --> 09:33.826
Yeah, she dumped me.

09:37.731 --> 09:39.531
Well, maybe
your D.A. investigator

09:39.533 --> 09:41.633
was shaking the wrong
trees while he was

09:41.635 --> 09:43.502
poking his nose
around my case.

09:43.504 --> 09:44.970
You're so full of crap, Danny.

09:44.972 --> 09:46.438
Hey, speak of the devil.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.638
My ballistics guy
said they won't know

09:47.640 --> 09:49.607
until they get it
under the microscope,

09:49.609 --> 09:52.243
but the bullets look consistent
with the Williams murder.

09:52.245 --> 09:54.446
Well, we know Diaz
didn't murder Miranda,

09:54.448 --> 09:56.448
because he couldn't
unless he's Harry Houdini.

09:56.450 --> 09:58.016
He's been in Rikers
for months.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.250
He could've ordered a hit.

09:59.252 --> 10:00.952
Which is consistent
with his M.O.

10:00.954 --> 10:03.254
Good to see you're finally
getting up to speed on the case.

10:03.256 --> 10:04.722
I start a trial tomorrow

10:04.724 --> 10:06.423
and I just lost my only witness.

10:06.425 --> 10:10.127
Can you two please find a way
to work together on this?

10:10.129 --> 10:12.129
Hey, fine by me.

10:12.131 --> 10:14.565
Whatever.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.701
You do realize I
already have a partner,

10:16.703 --> 10:18.603
and I don't need this
bozo slowing me down?

10:18.605 --> 10:20.637
I heard that, too.

10:25.211 --> 10:26.477
No one wants to see you
get hurt.

10:26.479 --> 10:27.577
Everyone wants to make sure
you're safe.

10:27.579 --> 10:31.781
I-I want to talk
to Jennifer first.

10:31.783 --> 10:35.752
We can try to arrange
for you to talk to her,

10:35.754 --> 10:38.021
but you got to come back
on this side, okay?

10:38.023 --> 10:40.924
No, no. I want to talk
to her first.

10:40.926 --> 10:42.325
We can't make that happen
until you come back

10:42.327 --> 10:44.060
on this side and you're safe,
okay?

10:45.664 --> 10:49.198
You never told me why your, uh,
fiancée broke it off with you.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.701
Because she hated my job,
and didn't much like

10:51.703 --> 10:53.802
who I was becoming
as a result of that.

10:53.804 --> 10:54.737
What'd you do?

10:54.739 --> 10:56.205
I listened to her.

10:56.207 --> 10:58.374
Made me realize
that we just weren't right

10:58.376 --> 11:00.657
for each other anymore; that's
why you should talk to her.

11:02.514 --> 11:04.847
You really think
that'll make a difference?

11:04.849 --> 11:07.550
I think it's worth a shot, Mike.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.554
Excuse me.

11:11.556 --> 11:13.722
Hi. I'm Officer Janko.
Are you Mike's girlfriend?

11:13.724 --> 11:15.524
Was his girlfriend.

11:15.526 --> 11:17.860
Okay. Can you come
with me, please?

11:17.862 --> 11:19.227
What are you doing here?

11:19.229 --> 11:23.231
He left me a voice mail about
what he was planning on doing.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.900
Is he really saying
he's gonna jump?

11:24.902 --> 11:26.435
He's in pretty rough shape,
yeah.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.603
Oh, my God.
This is all my fault.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.971
It's not your fault.

11:29.973 --> 11:31.106
I shouldn't have told him
I'm in love with Derek.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.307
Derek?
We work together.

11:32.309 --> 11:34.242
We have for years, actually,

11:34.244 --> 11:36.311
but it was like suddenly

11:36.313 --> 11:40.148
we both realized what was right
in front of us this whole time.

11:40.150 --> 11:41.916
I know you probably
don't understand.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.285
No, I-I do understand, actually.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.220
You feel like
you have a soul mate?

11:46.222 --> 11:47.254
Yeah, I do.

11:47.256 --> 11:48.723
Jennifer was mine.

11:48.725 --> 11:49.891
Maybe you were mistaken.

11:49.893 --> 11:51.759
Maybe she's just the warm-up
to the real thing.

11:51.761 --> 11:53.995
You think it's easy to meet
someone like that?

11:53.997 --> 11:57.865
Nah, I didn't say it's easy,
Mike, but it's possible.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.801
I wish I could believe you, man.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.936
Why don't you come back
over to this side

12:02.938 --> 12:04.905
and we can talk
about it more, huh?

12:04.907 --> 12:05.939
I didn't mean to hurt him.

12:05.941 --> 12:08.109
You're not responsible
for any of this.

12:08.111 --> 12:12.146
Mike's a nice guy,
but he's got some issues.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.015
Maybe I could
talk to him?

12:15.017 --> 12:17.250
Maybe I should
tell him I'm sorry?

12:17.252 --> 12:19.920
I think it's better if you don't
talk to him right now.

12:19.922 --> 12:22.789
I'm so sick of talking.

12:22.791 --> 12:24.557
Listen to me, Mike,
there are people

12:24.559 --> 12:27.094
who have survived jumping
from a bridge like this.

12:27.096 --> 12:29.630
They all have one thing
in common, though.

12:29.632 --> 12:31.231
They're all losers like me?

12:31.233 --> 12:34.334
They all said that
as soon as they let go,

12:34.336 --> 12:36.236
they immediately regretted it.

12:36.238 --> 12:38.704
You always have the power
to end things, Mike.

12:38.706 --> 12:42.875
But you don't have
to do that right now.

12:42.877 --> 12:44.977
Right now,
you can let me help you.

12:44.979 --> 12:48.681
What happens to me
if I come down?

12:48.683 --> 12:49.882
You'll be taken to the hospital,

12:49.884 --> 12:52.084
where there are people
who can help you through this.

12:52.086 --> 12:56.188
You'll be treated
with dignity and respect.

12:56.190 --> 12:59.258
Will you stay with me?

12:59.260 --> 13:02.161
I can come with you
to the hospital, if you want.

13:02.163 --> 13:04.429
I'll make sure you're okay.

13:05.666 --> 13:07.399
Trust me?

13:20.614 --> 13:22.881
All right.

13:24.918 --> 13:26.417
All right.

13:30.824 --> 13:32.456
Your own report says it.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.726
The use of firearms
by your officers

13:34.728 --> 13:36.728
is highest in incidents
with minorities.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.296
If you'd look closer,

13:38.298 --> 13:41.199
you'd see that criminal
suspects are highest

13:41.201 --> 13:44.502
among minorities as well...
unfortunately.

13:44.504 --> 13:45.636
What are you saying here?

13:45.638 --> 13:46.737
Just what the facts say.

13:46.739 --> 13:49.340
Most crimes occur
in minority neighborhoods,

13:49.342 --> 13:52.042
so it follows that
the highest use of firearms

13:52.044 --> 13:55.245
also occurs
in minority neighborhoods.

13:55.247 --> 13:57.147
Well, maybe most use of firearms
occur in minority neighborhoods

13:57.149 --> 13:59.349
because most cops
are concentrated there.

13:59.351 --> 14:01.952
That's as it should be;
we try to go where the crime is.

14:01.954 --> 14:03.954
People of color
are three times more likely

14:03.956 --> 14:05.989
to have the police use force
against them.

14:05.991 --> 14:07.825
Yes, and cops
across this country

14:07.827 --> 14:10.928
are "I don't know how many"
times more likely to be targets.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.462
That's apples and oranges.

14:12.464 --> 14:15.498
Not to me, not to us.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.735
I'm saying it's not
a logical comparison.

14:18.737 --> 14:19.869
Nothing about this is logical

14:19.871 --> 14:22.739
or born of an unbiased reading
of the facts.

14:22.741 --> 14:26.476
And this is not the first time
you've investigated my officers

14:26.478 --> 14:29.712
from behind an armored agenda.

14:29.714 --> 14:31.480
You're talking about your son.

14:31.482 --> 14:33.682
I'm talking about
one of my officers.

14:33.684 --> 14:35.317
Have it your way.

14:35.319 --> 14:39.155
Well, we're really not
in any danger of that, are we?

14:39.157 --> 14:40.857
What are you so afraid of?

14:40.859 --> 14:43.760
I'm not afraid of
any investigation

14:43.762 --> 14:47.463
into my department, Robert,
or I wouldn't be here.

14:47.465 --> 14:50.766
But a dog and pony show
needs a dog and a pony,

14:50.768 --> 14:52.334
and I'm not gonna be either one.

14:52.336 --> 14:55.804
Okay, so help me understand
why the small percentage

14:55.806 --> 14:58.039
of your cops that make up
the plainclothes units

14:58.041 --> 14:59.808
are responsible for
more than a quarter

14:59.810 --> 15:01.309
of all shooting incidents,

15:01.311 --> 15:02.944
all of them
in minority neighborhoods.

15:02.946 --> 15:05.213
All in high-crime neighborhoods.

15:05.215 --> 15:06.514
Again with that?

15:06.516 --> 15:09.217
All in neighborhoods
where law-abiding citizens

15:09.219 --> 15:10.986
are a dwindling majority.

15:10.988 --> 15:13.521
You've got a lot of spin

15:13.523 --> 15:16.858
for a guy who prides himself
on being a straight shooter.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.228
Fact: 99% of my cops do
a good job patrolling this city.

15:21.230 --> 15:23.264
But your department
is not perfect.

15:23.266 --> 15:26.066
No, we're not perfect.

15:26.068 --> 15:27.602
But in police work,

15:27.604 --> 15:29.304
perfect is the
enemy of good.

15:29.306 --> 15:32.307
It's the imperfect ones
we need to focus on.

15:32.309 --> 15:33.775
It's exactly the opposite.

15:33.777 --> 15:37.344
First and foremost, we need
to support and commend the cops

15:37.346 --> 15:40.915
who are out there on the street
putting their own lives

15:40.917 --> 15:43.818
on the line
to keep this city safe.

15:44.921 --> 15:46.253
Thank you.

15:48.357 --> 15:50.390
Thanks, Sam.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.263
Hey, Anthony, how are you?

15:57.265 --> 15:59.966
Deliriously happy to be working
with your partner here.

15:59.968 --> 16:01.768
Funny.

16:01.770 --> 16:02.902
Ballistics called.

16:02.904 --> 16:04.638
They say Gibbs was killed
with the same weapon

16:04.640 --> 16:06.740
used to kill Williams.
Yeah, problem is

16:06.742 --> 16:08.875
we don't have the gun.
We can't get a warrant?

16:08.877 --> 16:10.643
D.A.'s office said we don't have
enough for a warrant.

16:10.645 --> 16:12.345
We got those prints
from the scene.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.913
We already ran the prints, okay?

16:13.915 --> 16:15.181
We didn't get a hit.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.816
Gibbs said on the night
of the Williams murder,

16:16.818 --> 16:19.986
Diaz had another guy with him,
an unidentified male.

16:19.988 --> 16:21.287
So?
So let's find him.

16:21.289 --> 16:22.621
Don't you think

16:22.623 --> 16:25.057
we already tried to find him
when we first caught the case?

16:25.059 --> 16:27.192
All of the cameras in the
building were inoperable.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.527
The deli
across the street

16:28.529 --> 16:29.995
has a security camera.

16:29.997 --> 16:32.398
I've got footage of two guys
running out of the building

16:32.400 --> 16:34.700
right after
the Williams homicide.

16:35.636 --> 16:39.338
Not bad for a dumb-ass
D.A. investigator, huh?

16:53.424 --> 16:55.457
That could be Diaz.

16:55.459 --> 16:56.950
So this knucklehead on the left

16:56.951 --> 16:58.692
is our unidentified
male, right?

16:58.792 --> 17:00.092
Yeah, I can't
see his face.

17:00.094 --> 17:01.460
Well, zoom in.

17:03.297 --> 17:05.464
There you go.

17:06.767 --> 17:07.999
"Flatbush Leopards."

17:08.001 --> 17:09.435
What the hell is that?

17:09.436 --> 17:11.470
It's a baseball team.
Great.

17:11.472 --> 17:14.138
I guess it's time for some
peanuts and Cracker Jacks.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.509
I don't know the dude.
I never heard of him.

17:18.511 --> 17:19.810
You don't know the dude?
Well, that's funny

17:19.813 --> 17:21.113
'cause you were photographed
walking out

17:21.115 --> 17:22.714
of the Hoover projects
with that dude

17:22.715 --> 17:24.249
right after Mo Williams
was killed.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.817
I didn't kill anyone.

17:25.819 --> 17:27.484
And now the only witness
to that murder's dead, too.

17:27.487 --> 17:28.787
What a coincidence.

17:28.789 --> 17:30.821
I don't know what you want me
to say about that.

17:30.823 --> 17:31.723
Where were you yesterday

17:31.725 --> 17:33.190
between 11:00 a.m.
and 2:00 p.m.?

17:33.192 --> 17:34.692
Home.

17:34.694 --> 17:36.093
You got someone
who can verify that?

17:36.095 --> 17:38.229
Am I being charged?
You'll be charged soon enough.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.331
You willing to take
a lie detector test?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.767
I don't got to take
a lie detector test.

17:42.769 --> 17:45.035
Course not, 'cause you know
it's gonna tell us you're lying.

17:45.037 --> 17:46.337
Did Diaz tell you

17:46.339 --> 17:48.005
to kill Miranda Gibbs?

17:48.007 --> 17:49.495
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:49.496 --> 17:50.227
Sure you do.

17:50.228 --> 17:52.542
There's you and Diaz right there

17:52.544 --> 17:54.411
walking away from
the scene of the crime.

17:54.413 --> 17:57.547
That's all you got?
That's all we need.

17:57.549 --> 17:59.216
Look, I don't know the dude,
and unless I'm being charged

17:59.218 --> 18:01.585
with wearing a baseball cap,
I'm out of here.

18:01.587 --> 18:03.053
You're out of here
when I say you're out of here.

18:03.055 --> 18:05.088
Sit your ass down.

18:06.392 --> 18:08.057
Get him out of here.

18:08.059 --> 18:09.726
Now get the hell
out of here.

18:12.698 --> 18:15.031
We got to connect him to Diaz.

18:15.033 --> 18:16.833
We don't have enough
to subpoena the phone records.

18:16.835 --> 18:19.403
I know that.

18:19.405 --> 18:21.037
You know what?
Diaz is in Rikers.

18:21.039 --> 18:23.639
I got a friend at Rikers;
let me do some sniffing around.

18:23.641 --> 18:26.276
Good luck.

18:29.047 --> 18:32.615
Your Honor, my witness, Miranda
Gibbs, was murdered yesterday.

18:32.617 --> 18:36.085
We believe her murder is tied
to the defendant, Hiram Diaz.

18:36.087 --> 18:38.521
Objection, Your Honor.
Is that a magic bullet theory?

18:38.523 --> 18:40.923
The bullet traveled
from Rikers Island Prison,

18:40.925 --> 18:42.325
where my client
is incarcerated,

18:42.327 --> 18:44.193
all the way
to Washington Heights?

18:44.195 --> 18:45.394
I ask the court

18:45.396 --> 18:46.829
to give my office time

18:46.831 --> 18:49.064
to investigate to prove
that Miranda was murdered

18:49.066 --> 18:51.467
to ensure that she would not
testify in this case.

18:51.469 --> 18:53.368
I am loathe to inconvenience
the jury, Ms. Reagan.

18:53.370 --> 18:54.903
Perhaps, Your Honor,
the People should look

18:54.905 --> 18:56.271
into a career in fiction.

18:56.273 --> 18:58.573
There are no facts
to substantiate this.

18:58.575 --> 19:00.775
She's right.
Please, Your Honor.

19:00.777 --> 19:02.444
I'll give you until
Monday morning to come up

19:02.446 --> 19:04.546
with evidence linking
the defendant to this crime.

19:04.548 --> 19:07.382
If you are unable to do so,
the case will be dismissed.

19:07.384 --> 19:08.851
Thank you, Your Honor.

19:19.095 --> 19:20.328
Want to sit?

19:20.330 --> 19:22.364
Where? These are all
your open cases?

19:22.366 --> 19:24.332
Some of them.
Hmm.

19:24.334 --> 19:25.700
You know, despite
what you might think,

19:25.702 --> 19:27.168
we don't just sit around
with our thumbs

19:27.170 --> 19:28.502
up our ass around here.

19:28.504 --> 19:31.239
Right. You also reinvestigate
other people's cases.

19:31.241 --> 19:33.875
That's right. Because a lot
of times, the PD detectives

19:33.877 --> 19:35.542
don't look
at the bigger picture.

19:35.544 --> 19:36.978
Oh.
It's a lot harder to win

19:36.980 --> 19:38.746
at trial than it is
to just make an arrest.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.314
Okay, genius.

19:40.316 --> 19:42.183
You know what?
I don't need this.

19:42.185 --> 19:43.584
Look, take it easy, all right?

19:43.586 --> 19:45.586
Unlike you,
I'm not here to bust balls.

19:45.588 --> 19:47.053
I actually have some good news.

19:47.055 --> 19:47.988
You're stepping down?

19:47.990 --> 19:49.089
Not that good.

19:49.091 --> 19:50.991
I took a ride out to Rikers
with my partner,

19:50.993 --> 19:53.159
spoke to a C.O. I know,
who said that Mendez

19:53.161 --> 19:55.195
visited Diaz in Rikers
two days ago.

19:55.197 --> 19:56.930
That corroborates
they know each other.

19:56.932 --> 19:58.298
And the timeline means that

19:58.300 --> 20:00.500
Diaz could have ordered the hit
from the joint.

20:00.502 --> 20:01.534
That's great!

20:01.536 --> 20:03.536
Hey, not bad for a detective

20:03.538 --> 20:05.805
who doesn't know how to see
the big picture, huh?

20:11.246 --> 20:12.478
Hey.
Hey.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.014
They admitted Mike
for psychiatric evaluation.

20:14.016 --> 20:15.882
Turns out he might
have more going on

20:15.884 --> 20:17.349
than just a bad breakup.

20:17.351 --> 20:19.084
I really thought
he was gonna take a swan dive.

20:19.086 --> 20:20.686
Nice to feel like we
accomplished something, right?

20:20.688 --> 20:23.155
Accomplished something?
You saved a life.

20:23.157 --> 20:24.189
Yeah, we.

20:24.191 --> 20:26.826
No, he really responded to you.

20:26.828 --> 20:30.162
And that story you told
him about being engaged...

20:30.164 --> 20:31.997
That wasn't a story.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.232
I was engaged

20:33.234 --> 20:34.866
back in law school
and then we broke up

20:34.868 --> 20:37.002
right after I graduated
from academy.

20:37.004 --> 20:38.437
Why?

20:38.439 --> 20:41.673
Uh, low pay,
lack of upward mobility,

20:41.675 --> 20:44.676
the fact that she preferred
saying "my fiancé the lawyer,"

20:44.678 --> 20:45.877
over "my fiancé the beat cop."

20:45.879 --> 20:46.979
I don't know, take your pick.

20:46.981 --> 20:48.613
Any regrets?

20:48.615 --> 20:51.182
It didn't make me
want to jump off a bridge.

20:51.184 --> 20:54.052
But, I mean, you haven't had
anything serious since.

20:54.054 --> 20:55.353
I've dated.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.355
Right, dated,
but no girlfriends.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.991
Uh... so?

20:59.993 --> 21:02.093
So, you broke up,
like, six years ago.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.462
Are you still hung up on her?

21:03.464 --> 21:04.796
No.
Well, then why

21:04.798 --> 21:05.830
haven't you had a girlfriend?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.132
What's with all the questions?

21:08.134 --> 21:10.935
I just think it's weird
that you never mentioned her.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.503
Okay, what about Mr. Breakfast
Sandwich, all right?

21:12.505 --> 21:13.938
You never mentioned him before.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.139
That's not the same.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.807
We just started dating.
It's not serious.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.810
You spend the night with him,
but it's not serious?

21:19.812 --> 21:21.079
Oh, you're judging me.

21:21.081 --> 21:23.280
No, I'm just saying...
Now I see

21:23.282 --> 21:25.549
why you don't have a girlfriend.
Why?

21:25.551 --> 21:27.685
Because I think
maybe you're hung up on her.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.820
Maybe I just haven't found
the right person yet.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.455
Yeah, you just waiting
for your soul mate?

21:31.457 --> 21:32.590
What's wrong with that?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.392
Look how well that turned out
for Mike.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.342
Oh.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.077
Yeah.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.478
I'm sorry.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.347
We got played, all right.

21:58.349 --> 21:59.916
I never should've
suggested lunch.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.751
Everybody's got to eat.

22:01.753 --> 22:03.720
Well, then alone.
I should've been there.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.922
Well, that would've defeated
the purpose of me and him

22:05.924 --> 22:07.490
having an open conversation.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.458
Purpose got defeated anyway.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.260
What I said was
we're not perfect,

22:11.262 --> 22:13.862
but in police work,
perfect is the enemy of good.

22:15.065 --> 22:18.033
Once in a while,
I should just let you be you.

22:18.035 --> 22:19.467
I <i>was</i> being me.

22:19.469 --> 22:23.271
I thought it was a good idea--
you guys being seen together,

22:23.273 --> 22:25.607
working lunch, transparent.

22:25.609 --> 22:27.242
Not that you. The other you.

22:27.244 --> 22:30.913
The down-in-the-gutter,
any-weapon-handy you.

22:30.915 --> 22:31.779
Really?

22:31.781 --> 22:33.415
Yeah, really. From where I sit,

22:33.417 --> 22:37.085
we got invited to a block party
but showed up to a street fight.

22:37.954 --> 22:39.720
What do you want to do?

22:39.722 --> 22:42.623
Whatever it takes.

22:42.625 --> 22:43.358
Really?

22:43.360 --> 22:44.426
Yeah, really.

22:44.428 --> 22:47.929
You paint me
as apologizing for my cops,

22:47.931 --> 22:51.365
you better get ready
for some pushback.

22:53.036 --> 22:56.537
Okay, it's still gonna have to
have a veneer of cooperation,

22:56.539 --> 22:58.773
even some degree
of capitulation.

22:58.775 --> 23:00.741
Okay.

23:00.743 --> 23:03.844
Kind of like the Trojan horse.

23:07.431 --> 23:08.815
There you go.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.798
All right.

23:22.274 --> 23:24.274
You're not gonna believe this.
They released him.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.244
You serious?

23:25.245 --> 23:27.512
Yeah, said he wasn't a
danger to himself or others.

23:27.514 --> 23:28.914
It's not our call.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.949
You feel like
that guy was stable?

23:30.951 --> 23:32.651
No, but what are
we gonna do about it?

23:32.653 --> 23:34.019
12 David, you're on the air.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.954
12 David, go.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.989
You have a 10-34
at 2-5 East 2-3 Street.

23:38.991 --> 23:41.225
Perp is a male, white, 30 years,

23:41.227 --> 23:44.529
six-foot-two, wearing jeans
and a Grey T-shirt.

23:44.531 --> 23:46.330
It's Mike's girlfriend's
address.

23:46.332 --> 23:47.798
12 David responding.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.304
Let's go.

23:57.677 --> 23:59.877
Hey, Mike! Police!

24:01.647 --> 24:04.782
I'll do it,
you stupid bitch!

24:04.784 --> 24:07.517
I loved you!
You stupid bitch!

24:07.519 --> 24:09.086
Why?!

24:09.088 --> 24:11.388
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

24:11.390 --> 24:12.889
Drop the bat, Mike!
Drop the bat!

24:12.891 --> 24:15.125
Drop the bat!

24:15.127 --> 24:17.994
No, I just... I... I wanted
to talk to her, like you said!

24:17.996 --> 24:19.028
And she...

24:19.030 --> 24:20.063
she wouldn't listen
to me.

24:20.065 --> 24:21.164
Put it on the ground now, Mike!

24:21.166 --> 24:22.899
Drop the bat, Mike!
Oh, my God.

24:22.901 --> 24:24.267
Drop it!

24:24.269 --> 24:26.469
Hands against the wall! Put
your hands against the wall!

24:27.220 --> 24:29.673
No, no, no, no! I just
did what you told me to.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.676
I just did what you said.
I did what you said.

24:31.677 --> 24:32.139
Shut up, Mike.

24:32.143 --> 24:33.776
I did what you said.
I did what you said.

24:33.778 --> 24:35.211
Hey, shut up!

24:35.213 --> 24:36.512
I did...
Shut up.

24:37.281 --> 24:38.481
Got him?
Yeah.

24:42.854 --> 24:45.454
Central, we need a bus
at this location.

24:45.456 --> 24:46.989
Put a rush.

24:46.991 --> 24:50.259
I just tried to talk
to her, like you said, man.

24:50.261 --> 24:52.394
Just like you said.

25:02.439 --> 25:03.739
They met for 25 minutes.

25:03.741 --> 25:05.107
And they
met once before that,

25:05.109 --> 25:07.208
on October 16.

25:07.210 --> 25:08.810
Well, it establishes
that they knew each other,

25:08.812 --> 25:11.346
but it doesn't make either of
them culpable for either murder.

25:11.348 --> 25:13.314
Okay, so we get a warrant
for Mendez's place,

25:13.316 --> 25:15.083
we go and see
if we can find the gun

25:15.085 --> 25:16.417
or some other evidence.
Based on what,

25:16.419 --> 25:17.619
that they met with each other?

25:17.621 --> 25:18.553
Doesn't prove anything.

25:18.555 --> 25:20.288
Come on.
No, Danny,

25:20.290 --> 25:21.289
it won't fly.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.590
There's no confession,

25:22.592 --> 25:24.692
no gun, no corroboration.

25:24.694 --> 25:27.128
The meeting itself
is corroboration.

25:27.130 --> 25:28.263
What about
the fingerprint

25:28.265 --> 25:29.297
at the scene?

25:29.299 --> 25:30.665
Maybe it'll match Mendez.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.233
Mendez doesn't have
a criminal record.

25:32.235 --> 25:34.635
We have no fingerprints for him
on file.

25:36.939 --> 25:39.173
You got gloves?

25:39.175 --> 25:41.976
Who needs a warrant
when we got trash?

25:41.978 --> 25:45.279
But trash is public domain
as soon as it hits the street.

25:45.281 --> 25:47.247
Yeah, glad
you thought of that.

25:47.249 --> 25:48.448
Yeah.

25:48.450 --> 25:50.950
Got an envelope here
with his name and address on it.

25:50.952 --> 25:52.553
This is the right spot.

25:52.555 --> 25:55.088
You know you can tell a lot
about people from their garbage?

25:55.090 --> 25:56.089
Yeah.

25:56.091 --> 25:58.392
Like me, I-I like
Froot Loops.

25:58.394 --> 26:00.527
I loved Froot Loops
when I was a kid, too.

26:00.529 --> 26:03.129
My mother used to let me
eat out on the fire escape.

26:03.131 --> 26:04.831
There used to be
prizes in the box.

26:04.833 --> 26:07.600
Yeah, like the, uh...
the Batman periscope thing.

26:07.602 --> 26:09.035
Remember that?
How cool was that?

26:09.037 --> 26:11.805
Yeah. I had to fight my brother
for it, but I got it.

26:11.807 --> 26:13.740
See, that's how we have to think
of this trash, you know?

26:13.742 --> 26:15.474
It's like looking
for the prize inside.

26:15.476 --> 26:17.343
We just got to find
the fingerprint.

26:17.345 --> 26:19.245
Hey, give me one of those bags.

26:19.247 --> 26:21.114
You know, you have a
habit of talking like

26:21.116 --> 26:22.915
everybody works for
you, you know that?

26:22.917 --> 26:24.483
No, I don't know that.

26:24.485 --> 26:27.019
You know, what I want to know is
how you have the nerve to act

26:27.021 --> 26:28.854
like this is actually your case.

26:28.856 --> 26:30.590
I mean, I'm the one
who caught this case

26:30.592 --> 26:32.124
right from the 911 call.

26:32.126 --> 26:33.359
I was the one

26:33.361 --> 26:36.762
who had to notify his family
that this guy was murdered.

26:36.764 --> 26:38.431
Where were you?
I know where you were.

26:38.433 --> 26:39.932
You were sitting
in your cushy office

26:39.934 --> 26:42.467
while I was gift-wrapping
this entire case

26:42.469 --> 26:45.104
and placing it neatly
on Erin's desk with a bow on it,

26:45.106 --> 26:47.072
just so you guys
could screw it up.

26:47.074 --> 26:49.608
Yeah, and you did such a good
job that the guy responsible

26:49.610 --> 26:51.076
for the murder is gonna walk.

26:51.078 --> 26:53.946
That's 'cause you guys
didn't protect her.

26:53.948 --> 26:57.215
Danny, you must be a real son
of a bitch to be partners with.

26:57.217 --> 26:58.550
You don't have to
worry about it,

26:58.552 --> 26:59.618
'cause you'll never be
my partner.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.353
Yeah, thankfully.

27:01.355 --> 27:04.322
Think we just struck pay dirt.

27:07.761 --> 27:09.628
So you're
actually cooperating

27:09.630 --> 27:11.062
with the
attorney general?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.730
If by "cooperating," you mean

27:12.732 --> 27:14.632
did I give them
the facts and figures,

27:14.634 --> 27:16.801
I'm required by law to do that.

27:16.803 --> 27:17.735
That's not all.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.603
How's that?
Well, supplying them

27:19.605 --> 27:22.306
with data is one thing, but
discussing it over a cozy lunch

27:22.308 --> 27:24.541
at 21's kind of something else,
right?

27:24.543 --> 27:26.978
The paper didn't say
where I was.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.446
Come on, Dad. Cops got a
grapevine. You know this.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.749
Who said "cozy"?
It was anything but that.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.049
Radio car saw
the two of you going in,

27:33.051 --> 27:34.017
put the word out.

27:34.019 --> 27:35.286
And they said "cozy"?

27:35.288 --> 27:37.421
No, that's on me.
I always heard 21 was cozy.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.689
The article
in the newspaper said

27:38.691 --> 27:41.425
that you think that cops
could be doing a better job.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.760
That's why you don't believe
everything you read.

27:42.762 --> 27:43.927
So you were misquoted, then.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.195
I was partially quoted.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.363
They got the part
that implied cops were racist

27:47.365 --> 27:48.899
and that they use too much force

27:48.901 --> 27:50.733
and they should be made
an example of?

27:50.735 --> 27:52.035
No.
What'd they leave out,

27:52.037 --> 27:54.437
that you were talking
about Alabama in the '60s?

27:54.439 --> 27:56.306
Come on, guys.
He's just doing his job.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.708
By throwing shade on cops
for doing their jobs?

27:58.710 --> 27:59.876
You know I'd never do that.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.577
I know you wouldn't, Dad,
but perception.

28:01.579 --> 28:02.845
It's perception.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.682
So are you saying that there
should be no oversight?

28:05.684 --> 28:08.150
Oversight by politicians
in Albany? No.

28:08.152 --> 28:09.385
Their idea
of oversight

28:09.387 --> 28:10.420
is unleash the hounds.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.921
Imagine how
that makes Danny feel,

28:11.923 --> 28:13.155
after what
they put him through.

28:13.157 --> 28:14.691
I've got to agree.
That guy grilled me, too.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.826
"Oversight" is way too nice
a word for that.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.627
You can set
your watch by it.

28:18.629 --> 28:22.031
Every election cycle, they start
up investigations like this one

28:22.033 --> 28:23.565
to rile up the base.

28:23.567 --> 28:24.967
If you have nothing to hide,

28:24.969 --> 28:27.369
there's no reason to shy away
from the investigation.

28:27.371 --> 28:29.271
Except for the way it looks
to the public

28:29.273 --> 28:31.841
and especially
to the rank and file.

28:31.843 --> 28:32.842
That's right.

28:32.844 --> 28:37.245
So what does everyone suggest
I do?

28:37.247 --> 28:38.747
What do they think
you should do?

28:38.749 --> 28:40.548
A joint press conference
to make it look

28:40.550 --> 28:42.583
like we're all working together.

28:42.585 --> 28:44.985
Why not just tell them that
they're wrong about cops?

28:44.987 --> 28:46.721
Just don't cooperate.

28:46.723 --> 28:48.222
Then it'd look like
he was hiding something.

28:48.224 --> 28:50.190
I'm not hiding anything.

28:50.192 --> 28:52.760
I'm not saying we don't have
bull-moose cops.

28:52.762 --> 28:54.862
Of course,
those are the ones that make

28:54.864 --> 28:55.663
the front page.

28:55.665 --> 28:56.997
Exactly, Jack.

28:56.999 --> 28:58.431
I really hope you can
find your way through this, Dad.

28:58.433 --> 29:00.234
Morale is bad enough as it is
without feeling

29:00.236 --> 29:02.769
like the PC's looking at you
sideways, too.

29:03.839 --> 29:04.804
I'll second that.

29:04.806 --> 29:05.839
The fact is,

29:05.841 --> 29:07.307
doing your best
doesn't guarantee

29:07.309 --> 29:09.076
a good result, not out there.

29:09.078 --> 29:11.211
When one of them goes off,
it's the cop's fault.

29:11.213 --> 29:12.445
"Why'd you use your weapon?"

29:12.447 --> 29:13.913
"Why didn't you use
your weapon?"

29:13.915 --> 29:16.683
"Why didn't you prevent him
from harming someone else?"

29:19.821 --> 29:23.222
I hear you.

29:23.224 --> 29:25.492
I hear all of you.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.842
I ever tell you about
the first time I had a jumper?

29:45.446 --> 29:47.312
He jumped.

29:47.314 --> 29:49.381
Almost seven years.

29:49.383 --> 29:51.550
What's that?

29:51.552 --> 29:53.385
That's how long
I'm on the job.

29:53.387 --> 29:55.020
I don't really need
the "let me explain

29:55.022 --> 29:57.689
how things work"
speech anymore.

29:57.691 --> 30:00.025
Oh, that's what
you think this is?

30:00.027 --> 30:01.359
'Cause this ain't that.

30:01.361 --> 30:02.360
Well, then what is it?

30:02.362 --> 30:04.396
I heard what
happened, and...

30:04.398 --> 30:06.497
And what, you think you would've
done something different, Danny?

30:06.499 --> 30:08.099
You think you would've done
something better?

30:08.101 --> 30:11.169
No, I think you did everything
just right.

30:11.171 --> 30:12.837
Yeah, I did it just right.
I saved a guy's life

30:12.839 --> 30:15.006
so he could come back
and kill his girlfriend.

30:15.008 --> 30:16.942
Well, you don't control that.

30:16.944 --> 30:19.377
You did your job.
You saved his life.

30:19.379 --> 30:21.446
What he does with that second
chance, that's not on you.

30:21.448 --> 30:23.848
That's on him and his doctors.

30:23.850 --> 30:25.049
What, you could just
brush it off

30:25.051 --> 30:27.985
and blame it on the hospital,
move on, right?

30:30.122 --> 30:32.323
Robert Wesley Dunnam.

30:34.193 --> 30:36.026
That's his name.

30:36.028 --> 30:39.296
My first jumper.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.098
There isn't a day that goes by

30:41.100 --> 30:45.035
that I don't remember his name
or his face.

30:45.037 --> 30:47.338
Or all the other losses
I've had.

30:51.777 --> 30:53.343
That's a lot of weight.

30:53.345 --> 30:55.645
Yeah.

30:55.647 --> 30:59.816
But with time,
the wins offset the losses.

30:59.818 --> 31:02.919
What do you do when the scale
tips in favor of the losses?

31:02.921 --> 31:05.388
The mistakes you make,
ones you couldn't save.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.523
Then what?

31:06.525 --> 31:09.725
Then you reach out.

31:26.443 --> 31:27.977
Still here?

31:27.979 --> 31:30.412
We only got 12 hours
left to nail Diaz.

31:30.414 --> 31:31.413
Of course I'm here.

31:31.415 --> 31:32.681
I just came from the lab.

31:32.683 --> 31:33.883
The fingerprints

31:33.885 --> 31:36.118
from the crime scene
matches Mendez.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.586
That's enough for an arrest.

31:37.588 --> 31:39.688
And a warrant to search
his place for the gun.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.156
Let's go.

31:43.727 --> 31:46.094
The Office of the
Attorney General has received

31:46.096 --> 31:48.730
comprehensive data from the NYPD

31:48.732 --> 31:50.732
in regards to the percentage
of arrests

31:50.734 --> 31:54.002
where excessive use
of force is involved.

31:54.004 --> 31:56.238
Your study is focusing
on whether the NYPD

31:56.240 --> 31:58.240
is guilty of racial bias?

31:58.242 --> 32:00.441
We are looking to examine
the impact of force

32:00.443 --> 32:03.177
on African-American, Latino
and other minority communities

32:03.179 --> 32:06.247
and whether that
use of force is justified.

32:06.249 --> 32:08.750
You think the NYPD
targets minorities?

32:08.752 --> 32:10.718
We are looking
at ways to bring down

32:10.720 --> 32:11.853
the use of excessive force

32:11.855 --> 32:14.022
and the frequency
of discharging weapons

32:14.024 --> 32:15.889
in minority communities
in an effort

32:15.891 --> 32:18.159
to make that population
feel safer.

32:18.161 --> 32:19.427
How do you plan
on accomplishing that?

32:19.429 --> 32:20.761
I'd like to answer that, Grace.

32:20.763 --> 32:22.963
Here we go.

32:22.965 --> 32:24.865
But first, I'd like to, uh,
clear up a quote

32:24.867 --> 32:28.102
that was attributed to me
in Friday's paper.

32:28.104 --> 32:31.772
The NYPD has the
lowest recorded level

32:31.774 --> 32:35.709
of firearms discharge
since 1971.

32:35.711 --> 32:39.813
When I said, "We're not
perfect," that is true.

32:39.815 --> 32:43.249
We'd only be perfect
if we never fired a gun,

32:43.251 --> 32:46.252
in a perfect world
where we could stop criminals

32:46.254 --> 32:49.422
with the wag of a finger
or a stern talking to.

32:49.424 --> 32:51.257
As it is,

32:51.259 --> 32:53.659
the most significant fact
in the report

32:53.661 --> 32:56.929
that Mr. Lewis was referring to
is this:

32:56.931 --> 33:00.967
that last year, with 35,000 cops

33:00.969 --> 33:05.805
on a force patrolling
8.5 million people,

33:05.807 --> 33:08.975
there were exactly 35 incidents

33:08.977 --> 33:12.311
where an officer
discharged his weapon.

33:14.616 --> 33:17.483
Thirty-five.

33:17.485 --> 33:19.218
Go crunch that number.

33:19.220 --> 33:20.119
Well, you make it sound...

33:20.121 --> 33:21.453
I'm not finished.

33:22.256 --> 33:25.657
The only way to
keep people safe

33:25.659 --> 33:27.659
is to enforce laws.

33:27.661 --> 33:31.230
And when we start allowing
frivolous investigations

33:31.232 --> 33:35.267
whose only purpose
is political leverage,

33:35.269 --> 33:37.369
that's when we sacrifice safety.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.015
Look at the nice little gun

33:55.016 --> 33:56.811
we found in your apartment.

33:56.813 --> 33:58.747
- So?
- So?

33:58.749 --> 34:01.215
We also found your fingerprints
in Mo Williams' apartment.

34:01.217 --> 34:02.816
- So?
- So, the fingerprints

34:02.818 --> 34:05.219
put you there; and if this turns
out to be the murder weapon,

34:05.221 --> 34:06.754
guess where
you're gonna be sitting?

34:06.756 --> 34:08.755
In a nice courtroom right
beside your buddy Diaz,

34:08.757 --> 34:10.525
on trial for murder.

34:10.527 --> 34:11.891
Diaz will get off.

34:11.893 --> 34:13.393
He's right.

34:13.396 --> 34:15.163
Diaz might get off.

34:15.165 --> 34:16.531
What are you talking about?
No way.

34:16.533 --> 34:18.266
There's no witness anymore.

34:18.268 --> 34:19.800
That's right.
There's no way

34:19.802 --> 34:22.101
Diaz is getting off.
Forget about it!

34:22.103 --> 34:24.972
He's beat every murder charge,
every time.

34:24.974 --> 34:26.739
Well, he's not gonna beat
this one. Okay? In fact,

34:26.742 --> 34:29.743
I got 50 bucks says Diaz
won't beat the rap this time.

34:29.745 --> 34:31.078
- Done.
- Okay.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.312
Want to double that?

34:32.313 --> 34:35.081
A hundred says
this guy won't get off.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.184
Come on, I'm
not a sucker.

34:37.186 --> 34:38.385
Of course he's not gonna
get off. He's toast.

34:38.387 --> 34:39.453
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you guys saying?

34:39.455 --> 34:41.054
Your prints
match the gun,

34:41.056 --> 34:42.589
then the only thing getting off

34:42.591 --> 34:44.291
is all those cons
in Rikers

34:44.293 --> 34:46.525
when your sweet ass
comes walking through the door.

34:46.527 --> 34:48.594
Oh, yeah,
skinny dude like you--

34:48.597 --> 34:50.563
easy prey.

34:50.565 --> 34:52.164
Mm-hmm.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.399
Well, it's true.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.167
Unless of course,
you want to cooperate.

34:55.168 --> 34:57.869
Then we could probably
protect you from Diaz

34:57.871 --> 34:59.671
and we could talk to the D.A.

34:59.673 --> 35:01.707
and see if she'll cut you
a deal.

35:01.709 --> 35:04.175
Offer expires
when the results come back.

35:04.177 --> 35:05.577
Ticktock,

35:05.579 --> 35:08.513
ticktock,

35:08.515 --> 35:10.215
ticktock.

35:10.217 --> 35:12.250
Let me talk to her.

35:15.788 --> 35:17.489
And who gave
you that directive?

35:17.491 --> 35:19.724
Hiram told me
to kill Miranda Gibbs.

35:19.726 --> 35:20.958
Why?

35:20.960 --> 35:22.960
So she wouldn't be able
to testify against him.

35:22.962 --> 35:24.762
Objection. Calls for hearsay.

35:24.764 --> 35:27.031
It's not hearsay, Your Honor.
It's an admission.

35:27.033 --> 35:29.534
As a high ranking member
of the Double Treys,

35:29.536 --> 35:31.568
the defendant
ordered Mr. Mendez

35:31.570 --> 35:32.870
to kill Miranda Gibbs.

35:32.872 --> 35:34.005
I'll allow it.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.473
Do you know who killed
Mo Williams?

35:36.475 --> 35:38.408
It was Hiram Diaz.

35:38.410 --> 35:40.845
Objection!
Overruled.

35:41.914 --> 35:44.815
Do you know why the defendant
killed Mo Williams?

35:44.817 --> 35:46.450
Objection! Speculation.

35:46.452 --> 35:48.385
Mr. Mendez,
if you know why...

35:48.387 --> 35:49.386
I know why.

35:49.388 --> 35:50.521
How do you know?

35:50.523 --> 35:52.289
'Cause I was there.

35:52.291 --> 35:53.690
That's not speculation
or hearsay.

35:53.692 --> 35:54.891
He was an eyewitness.

35:54.893 --> 35:56.293
Overruled.

35:58.631 --> 36:01.765
Why did the defendant
kill Mo Williams?

36:01.767 --> 36:05.001
The old man was writing letters
and petitions and stuff

36:05.003 --> 36:07.303
trying to get the drug dealers
out of the building.

36:07.305 --> 36:09.939
Who controls the drug trade
in that building?

36:16.081 --> 36:18.214
Hiram Diaz.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.883
Can you point him out?

36:23.221 --> 36:24.887
That's him right there.

36:26.924 --> 36:28.224
Let the record state

36:28.226 --> 36:31.427
that the witness pointed
to the defendant, Hiram Diaz.

36:32.763 --> 36:34.797
You're a dead man!
I'll kill you!

36:34.799 --> 36:35.898
- I'll kill you!
- Hey!

36:35.900 --> 36:38.067
Remove the defendant
from the courtroom!

36:40.004 --> 36:40.869
And you, too, bitch!

36:40.871 --> 36:43.072
Remove the defendant!

36:53.850 --> 36:55.850
Did it ever occur to you
that I might not

36:55.852 --> 36:57.285
be the only one
in here changing?

36:57.287 --> 37:00.322
Well, I do a little recon
before I just charge in here.

37:00.324 --> 37:02.624
I know why you're checking up
on me, and I'm fine.

37:02.626 --> 37:04.492
It was circumstances
outside my control.

37:04.494 --> 37:05.694
I'm good.

37:05.696 --> 37:07.095
Really?

37:08.098 --> 37:10.297
Yeah, how was I supposed
to know he was gonna...

37:10.299 --> 37:11.532
kill his girlfriend?

37:11.534 --> 37:12.022
Right.

37:12.046 --> 37:13.702
Guess I could've
gone to Bellevue,

37:13.703 --> 37:17.705
maybe talked to the doctors,
made sure they kept him in.

37:17.707 --> 37:18.906
Yeah, I'm sure
they would've listened

37:18.908 --> 37:21.142
to a beat cop
over their own diagnosis.

37:21.144 --> 37:22.810
It's the system's fault?

37:22.812 --> 37:24.545
They're the ones
that released him.

37:24.547 --> 37:26.147
We can take the blame

37:26.149 --> 37:27.448
for a lot of things, Jamie.

37:27.450 --> 37:28.616
God knows, cops are blamed

37:28.618 --> 37:31.252
for all of society's ills
these days.

37:31.254 --> 37:34.187
But you're not responsible for
someone with mental problems

37:34.189 --> 37:35.989
becoming homicidal.

37:35.991 --> 37:37.524
Well, he said
he went to talk to her

37:37.526 --> 37:38.992
because of what I said
to him, but...

37:38.994 --> 37:41.762
Well, he probably would've
talked to her anyway.

37:42.598 --> 37:44.164
Probably.

37:44.166 --> 37:45.598
Maybe.

37:47.936 --> 37:50.470
We'll never know
for sure, you know?

37:50.472 --> 37:52.338
You know what I know for sure?

37:53.408 --> 37:55.876
You're a great cop.

37:58.914 --> 38:00.647
Yeah, well, Dr. Phil,

38:00.649 --> 38:03.048
I'm not on the verge
or anything, I'm just bummed.

38:03.050 --> 38:04.417
Nothing a...

38:04.419 --> 38:07.654
friendly round of darts,
couple cold ones can't cure?

38:07.656 --> 38:09.889
Thought you had a concert
with Mr. Breakfast Sandwich.

38:09.891 --> 38:13.225
Yeah, he had a...
you know, he had a work thing.

38:13.227 --> 38:14.827
No Bruce Springsteen?

38:14.829 --> 38:16.061
Not tonight.

38:16.063 --> 38:19.398
But we could take a wrong turn
and just keep going.

38:21.002 --> 38:22.268
You're so corny.

38:23.437 --> 38:25.570
Oh, you love it.

38:29.443 --> 38:30.742
Your brother hates my guts.

38:30.744 --> 38:31.944
No, he doesn't.

38:31.946 --> 38:33.144
I don't care.

38:33.146 --> 38:34.446
I don't like him either.

38:34.448 --> 38:36.448
Time to bury the hatchet, okay?

38:36.450 --> 38:38.417
Hey.

38:38.419 --> 38:39.584
Hi. Sit.

38:39.586 --> 38:41.687
I ordered
a bottle of wine.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.290
Sit.

38:48.462 --> 38:52.297
Here's to a job well done
by the both of you.

38:52.299 --> 38:55.133
We closed two murder cases.

38:57.437 --> 38:59.804
Come on, guys. Cheers.

38:59.806 --> 39:01.139
Cheers.

39:01.141 --> 39:02.573
Cheers.

39:04.311 --> 39:06.510
You guys gonna be
this much fun all night?

39:07.647 --> 39:08.781
You know, I-I don't get it.
Me neither.

39:08.782 --> 39:09.831
What?

39:09.855 --> 39:11.850
You got
this tough-as-nails

39:11.851 --> 39:15.219
A.D.A. here, and she's insisting
that we break bread together.

39:15.221 --> 39:17.388
As if that's gonna
change anything.

39:18.224 --> 39:19.957
What is it with you?

39:19.959 --> 39:22.159
It's like some kind of
middle child syndrome.

39:22.161 --> 39:23.626
I mean, you've always
been like this,

39:23.628 --> 39:25.329
in the middle
of everyone's business.

39:25.331 --> 39:26.796
I just thought maybe
we could get past

39:26.798 --> 39:29.532
this whole rivalry thing
you guys have going on.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.834
Why?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.836
Because it's juvenile
and I don't get it.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.372
Oh, so if another A.D.A.
were to come and steal your case

39:35.374 --> 39:37.640
right in the middle of a trial
without consulting you, you'd be

39:37.642 --> 39:40.042
okay with that, right?
Or if another A.D.A.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.579
who you were trying to help
win her case accused you

39:42.581 --> 39:46.115
of trying to upstage her,
you'd be okay with that, too?

39:46.117 --> 39:47.484
I just thought

39:47.486 --> 39:51.654
we could get past this,
enjoy the win and move on.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.191
Okay. Fine.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.193
But if he ever tries
to steal another one

39:57.195 --> 39:58.895
of my cases...
You won't even

39:58.897 --> 40:00.662
get a courtesy call
to let you know.

40:00.664 --> 40:03.565
Oh, you are a real prick.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.768
You, too.

40:07.171 --> 40:08.737
<i>If we're done for the day,</i>

40:08.739 --> 40:10.072
I'm gonna pack it in.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.840
We're not.
Where are we going?

40:11.842 --> 40:13.742
To my office.
I've invited company.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.010
Who?
Lewis.

40:15.012 --> 40:16.445
Why?

40:16.447 --> 40:18.847
He's heading back to Albany.
I wanted to say good-bye.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.783
Seriously?
And he agreed to come up?

40:20.785 --> 40:22.017
Yes.

40:22.019 --> 40:24.986
Here he is.
We were just talking about you.

40:24.988 --> 40:25.854
And I'm gonna be talking

40:25.856 --> 40:27.389
to the governor
about you.

40:27.391 --> 40:28.990
Want to use my phone?
No.

40:28.992 --> 40:30.658
We have the friends
and family plan.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.027
It's peanuts to call Albany.

40:32.029 --> 40:34.996
The governor has the power to
fire you. You know that, right?

40:34.998 --> 40:37.665
I read the fine print
when I took the job.

40:37.667 --> 40:39.688
You want to do your job?

40:39.689 --> 40:41.183
I <i>am</i> doing my job.

40:41.207 --> 40:42.130
How's that?

40:42.131 --> 40:43.464
Letting him be him.

40:43.466 --> 40:45.098
As if you had a choice.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.367
He does. Believe me.

40:47.369 --> 40:48.601
I'd love to know
what you think

40:48.603 --> 40:49.703
you accomplished here.

40:49.705 --> 40:52.239
Some hurt feelings, apparently.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.741
Your little stunt has earned
your department an investigation

40:54.743 --> 40:57.410
into chain of evidence
inventories,

40:57.412 --> 40:58.979
and that's just the beginning.

40:58.981 --> 41:01.381
So that's how this works.

41:01.383 --> 41:03.750
You know damn well
how it works.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.618
And you need to wake up
to the reality

41:05.620 --> 41:07.587
that the police department
does not command

41:07.589 --> 41:09.756
the same respect it once did.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.324
Those days
are long gone.

41:11.326 --> 41:12.992
Maybe to you.

41:12.994 --> 41:14.994
And your grandstanding
has only made it worse.

41:14.996 --> 41:18.898
The day that telling the truth
makes it worse from up here,

41:18.900 --> 41:22.835
I'll call the governor myself
and ask him to fire me.

41:22.837 --> 41:25.437
I don't know
whether to admire you

41:25.439 --> 41:28.007
for having the balls
to fight a losing battle

41:28.009 --> 41:30.877
or to pity you
because you have no idea

41:30.879 --> 41:32.378
what you're up against.

41:32.380 --> 41:34.946
Either way,

41:34.948 --> 41:38.116
I'm looking at a dinosaur.

41:42.490 --> 41:44.089
Good night, gentlemen.

41:54.034 --> 41:55.666
Dinosaur?

41:55.668 --> 41:58.003
What the man said.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.706
Probably right.

42:01.708 --> 42:03.308
No.

42:03.310 --> 42:05.510
Dinosaurs are extinct.

42:06.780 --> 42:08.979
You still roam the Earth.
