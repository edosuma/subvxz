00:00.210 --> 00:03.384
You know sometimes a 21 minute
15 second episode of Broad City

00:03.390 --> 00:06.039
isn't enough of the world
of Broad City for me

00:06.046 --> 00:07.093
No, me niether.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.540
Right after this episode you
are gonna get behind the scenes

00:09.547 --> 00:13.107
exclusive footage of how our
show Broad City is made.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.610
It is like a behind the
curtain look at Broad City.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.246
Very informative and
you're gonna dig it.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.781
Stay tuned after the episode
for a behind the scenes look

00:20.787 --> 00:22.316
at the making of Broad City

00:22.322 --> 00:24.218
- I love a good BTS
- Me, too.

00:24.224 --> 00:27.620
- I love a hot BTS
- BTS to the BTS, baby!

00:28.291 --> 00:30.577
- Thank you for house-sitting.
- Thank you.

00:30.584 --> 00:32.819
I'm taking Oliver for
detox in the Hamptons.

00:32.826 --> 00:35.129
Standardized testing has
really stressed him out.

00:36.403 --> 00:39.233
Now here, make sure you
feed the blue macaw,

00:39.239 --> 00:41.569
and make sure the house gets
a lot of positive energy.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.870
I think I can manage that.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.238
Great.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.140
Oliver, our Uber's close.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.808
Times tables! Topic sentences!

00:47.814 --> 00:49.577
Five paragraph essay!
Five paragraph essay!

00:49.583 --> 00:51.412
Oliver, chill, chill, chill.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.414
Standardized testing
does not define you.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.249
Nothing can happen in the global economy

00:55.255 --> 00:57.585
that will ever make you need to work.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.122
Hi, Uber, we're out front!

01:01.128 --> 01:04.292
Whoa! A helicopter?
I thought Uber just had cars.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.760
Uber has cars?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.166
Buh-bye!

01:12.461 --> 01:14.434
Enjoy the Hamptons!

01:18.791 --> 01:21.375
Wow... okay, dude, we're safe.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.853
Ooh.

01:29.531 --> 01:31.075
You know, there's a gate right there.

Double jumbo capacity washer-dryer,

02:15.661 --> 02:19.518
Enter ze master bath.

02:19.525 --> 02:22.121
Italian
marble, Asian marble,

02:22.128 --> 02:25.675
Puerto Rican marble,
every ethnicity of marble.

02:26.232 --> 02:27.801
And the coochie de gras...

02:31.042 --> 02:32.304
Is that a bidet?

02:32.405 --> 02:35.141
You bidet believe it is.

02:39.813 --> 02:40.841
Let's try staccato.

02:43.350 --> 02:45.636
I'm gonna check on my
online dating profiles.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.801
Whew, the water is perfectly warmed

02:47.808 --> 02:50.405
- to accommodate my anus.
- Oh, my God, dude.

02:50.412 --> 02:53.344
My high school English teacher, Mr.
Miller, is on Bumble.

02:55.327 --> 02:58.057
That is unreal!

02:58.064 --> 02:59.960
Oh, also your Bumble thing is hot.

02:59.966 --> 03:01.865
I don't know, I feel like
it's a little creepy.

03:01.888 --> 03:05.366
Hell yeah, sometimes in life
you need creepy, freaky fucks.

03:05.372 --> 03:07.191
Plus, you guys are both adults now.

03:07.198 --> 03:09.625
You must swipe "yas,"
you cannot swipe "nas."

03:09.632 --> 03:11.704
Yeah, you're right,
we are both adults now.

03:11.711 --> 03:13.347
Plus, I always had a thing for him.

03:13.354 --> 03:15.141
Yeah, teachers are the ultimate fantasy.

03:15.148 --> 03:17.837
- Yeah, you know what?
- You're right. I'm doing it.

03:19.755 --> 03:20.960
Oh, my God. Okay, we matched.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.938
Hell yeah, you did, you creepy bitch.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.849
- All right, what do I say?
- Say, um...

03:24.864 --> 03:26.860
I need help studying for my ACTs

03:26.874 --> 03:29.043
and I'm trying to get a 69.

03:31.164 --> 03:34.161
I'm gonna write, "Hey. Long time."

03:34.578 --> 03:36.017
Okay, sent.

03:38.637 --> 03:40.333
Okay, um, he's typing.

03:42.075 --> 03:43.775
He's still typing. Jesus.

03:45.057 --> 03:46.551
Okay, he's... Okay, he wrote,

03:46.558 --> 03:48.446
"I'm in town, do you want
to meet up tonight?"

03:51.384 --> 03:53.480
Is that about the message or the bidet?

03:55.355 --> 03:57.418
Honestly, both.

03:57.424 --> 03:59.588
He should come here.
This place is so adult.

03:59.595 --> 04:01.221
You know, you'll seem older than he is.

04:01.227 --> 04:02.375
That's perfect.

04:02.382 --> 04:03.835
Okay, I'm gonna say that

04:03.849 --> 04:06.968
we're having an adults-only soiree

04:06.975 --> 04:09.037
and that he should stop by. Casual.

04:09.044 --> 04:10.091
Love it.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.664
Gaga, now all that's left is prep.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.797
Sit your sweet ass on this bidet.

04:15.804 --> 04:17.973
I feel like a wine glass
fresh out of the dishwasher.

04:32.850 --> 04:33.913
Now get into it.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.578
So what's going on with you and Lincoln?

04:35.585 --> 04:37.389
It's official now.
He's, like, your boyfriend.

04:37.396 --> 04:38.979
Yeah, you know, it's just that,

04:38.994 --> 04:41.882
um, just trying not to
choke it out with a label.

04:41.889 --> 04:43.890
You know, I'm just like,
it is an essential part

04:43.897 --> 04:45.833
of my character that I'm
just not into labels.

04:45.839 --> 04:48.262
So we're just enjoying the ride.

04:48.269 --> 04:50.251
Yeah, I think that's great.

04:51.028 --> 04:52.051
Oh, dude, it's him.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.287
Okay, he's on his way.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.420
Oh, my God. That was fast.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.530
Yikes. Hot, dude.
Dry that sweet ass and move.

05:01.488 --> 05:02.912
It's wet.

05:03.790 --> 05:06.032
You know what, I think I need
to change into something

05:06.039 --> 05:08.489
a little more casual
like... resort wear?

05:08.495 --> 05:11.798
"Resort wear"? You are naturally rich.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.213
- You ready?
- Yeah.

05:16.487 --> 05:17.898
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

05:17.904 --> 05:20.200
Um, do like...

05:20.206 --> 05:21.936
This is, like, a little more mature.

05:21.942 --> 05:23.777
- Ooh, perfect.
- Great.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.576
- Oh. Jaimé.
- Hi.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.349
- God, you're a princess...
- Thank you.

05:31.356 --> 05:33.480
- In a castle.
- Hey.

05:33.487 --> 05:35.717
- How you holding up, BB?
- Ay, how do you think?

05:35.724 --> 05:37.903
You know, I had an adult circumcision

05:37.910 --> 05:40.931
and I cannot get hard
for two more weeks.

05:40.938 --> 05:42.434
Why can't you get hard?

05:42.896 --> 05:44.525
'Cause his stitches will tear.

05:44.531 --> 05:45.993
- My penis.
- Duh.

05:45.999 --> 05:48.395
Oh, obviously.

05:48.401 --> 05:50.264
You can't just hold books.

05:50.270 --> 05:51.565
You have to actually read them.

05:51.571 --> 05:52.643
Yeah.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.416
Oh, my God. Um...

06:09.422 --> 06:11.986
I cannot be around vibrations
in my current state.

06:11.992 --> 06:14.747
- Do you mind if we just...
- Okay.

06:21.968 --> 06:24.265
So... Italian marble,

06:24.271 --> 06:26.066
Asian marble, Puerto Rican marble,

06:26.072 --> 06:29.109
and... the coochie de gras.

06:32.098 --> 06:35.829
A bidet is synonymous with
sex in rich Guatemala.

06:36.116 --> 06:38.212
A boner is inevitable,
I cannot be in here.

06:38.218 --> 06:39.513
- I'm so sorry. I... I...
- Go.

06:39.519 --> 06:41.181
I see. Wow.

06:41.187 --> 06:42.989
Shit, dude, my teacher's here!

06:46.426 --> 06:49.089
Hello, my dear!

06:49.095 --> 06:51.025
Hello, my, um,

06:51.031 --> 06:53.217
my fluid... dude.

06:55.035 --> 06:56.397
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:56.403 --> 06:58.399
Oh, my...

06:58.405 --> 07:00.034
Okay. He's here, he's here.

07:03.209 --> 07:04.244
We got it.

07:07.681 --> 07:09.443
- Hey.
- Hey, Abbi.

07:09.449 --> 07:10.945
Hey, Mr. Miller.

07:10.951 --> 07:12.046
- Richard.
- Richard.

07:15.422 --> 07:18.485
Um, hey, Ilana, Lincoln,

07:18.491 --> 07:20.267
uh, this is a man.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.271
And this is Lincoln,
he is a... a man, as well.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.059
Friend from way back when.

07:25.065 --> 07:26.120
Pal and a confidant.

07:26.127 --> 07:28.262
Former teacher.
He's not my teacher anymore.

07:28.268 --> 07:29.354
We're on a date now.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.989
And this is Lincoln. He is my...

07:33.791 --> 07:36.062
boy... friend?

07:38.893 --> 07:41.580
Yeah. He's my boyfriend.

07:42.415 --> 07:43.677
That's great.

07:43.696 --> 07:46.514
Wow, that took a long time...

07:47.447 --> 07:48.673
to say.

07:52.093 --> 07:53.956
Huh, a taxidermy room.

07:54.135 --> 07:56.170
Oh. Nothing. Hi.

07:56.177 --> 07:58.687
Uh, Jaimé, this is, um...

07:59.250 --> 08:00.274
Richard.

08:00.281 --> 08:03.614
Um... he was my teach guy.

08:04.157 --> 08:06.353
Not anymore. That's why we're on a date.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.902
- I mean, it's not why...
- He used to be your teacher?

08:08.909 --> 08:11.590
And now you're on a date?

08:11.597 --> 08:12.893
Yes.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.097
Ow. Excuse me, I'm gonna...

08:16.103 --> 08:19.242
Ow! Can't... touch. I'm so sorry.

08:31.485 --> 08:33.833
Okay, is it kinda weird
that we're on a date?

08:33.841 --> 08:35.426
I mean, not really.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.472
I mean, we're adults, right?

08:37.480 --> 08:39.953
Yeah, you're right.
I am an adult now. "Supposably."

08:39.976 --> 08:42.457
Supposedly. With a "D."

08:42.462 --> 08:44.191
Sorry. English teacher mode.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.993
It's fine.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.963
Speaking of which, I did love it when

08:48.969 --> 08:51.671
you used to make Tina Palmer
stop saying "like" so much.

08:51.678 --> 08:53.334
She'd never let me sit
at her lunch table

08:53.340 --> 08:55.017
because, "like, I wasn't hot enough."

08:55.024 --> 08:56.160
- What?
- Yeah!

08:56.167 --> 08:58.039
You were so much cuter than her.

08:58.529 --> 09:00.613
I mean, you're not so bad yourself.

09:01.048 --> 09:03.411
I used to think about you like that.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.919
I used to think about you like that too.

09:12.269 --> 09:14.489
I, um...

09:14.495 --> 09:16.524
I have to go piss...

09:16.530 --> 09:18.298
hard.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.362
I'm gonna...

09:21.368 --> 09:24.332
- Hon, do zip me up.
- Of course, m'lady.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.560
Oh, sweetie, let me get that for you.

09:28.575 --> 09:30.338
Your fingers are for two things.

09:30.344 --> 09:32.340
Filling cavities, and filling cavities.

09:32.678 --> 09:34.575
Oh, you!

09:34.581 --> 09:37.072
Mm. My man.

09:37.078 --> 09:40.783
Ilana, I'm gonna be honest 'cause
we're in a relationship now.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.716
I don't think you got this 100% right.

09:42.723 --> 09:44.895
This is... this is horrible.

09:44.902 --> 09:48.148
I promise to improve.
You're my priority now.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.558
Ilana?

09:51.111 --> 09:52.660
I need to talk.

09:52.666 --> 09:55.196
BRB, Abbi's a priority.

09:55.202 --> 09:57.498
- Whoa, love that outfit.
- Thank you.

09:57.504 --> 10:00.001
Okay, I don't know if I
can do this with Richard.

10:00.007 --> 10:01.741
He's, like, really creeping me out.

10:01.748 --> 10:03.604
- Mmm, so hot.
- No, it's not, okay?

10:03.610 --> 10:06.574
He said he thought about me like that.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.489
Like, when I was his student, though.

10:08.496 --> 10:09.744
I mean, you don't think...

10:09.750 --> 10:11.346
that he jerked off to me?

10:11.352 --> 10:13.100
- Yeah.
- Really?

10:13.107 --> 10:14.248
Bitch, durr.

10:14.254 --> 10:16.017
All teachers jerk off to their students.

10:16.023 --> 10:18.542
No, they don't. All teachers do
not jerk off to their students.

10:18.549 --> 10:19.977
Oh, sweet Abbi.

10:19.984 --> 10:23.017
Once students have flowered,
teachers are either fucking them

10:23.024 --> 10:24.258
or jerking off to them.

10:24.264 --> 10:27.067
Respect the ones who only jerk off.
The other ones are in the news.

10:27.074 --> 10:28.827
No, no, no!

10:28.834 --> 10:30.031
Ilana, no.

10:30.037 --> 10:31.536
We can't control our thoughts, dude.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.770
Jerking off is not a crime.

10:32.777 --> 10:34.304
Well, it depends on where you do it.

10:34.311 --> 10:35.859
In the privacy of their own home?

10:35.866 --> 10:38.063
Listen, if Lincoln and
I ever have children...

10:38.070 --> 10:40.830
And believe me, we're not talking
about that for a couple of years...

10:40.837 --> 10:42.710
I hope their teachers
are jerking off to them.

10:42.716 --> 10:44.412
You do?

10:44.418 --> 10:46.114
If it keeps their disgusting hands

10:46.120 --> 10:47.515
off my hot-ass, bl-ewish kids,

10:47.521 --> 10:49.217
then yeah.

10:49.223 --> 10:51.296
I don't know, it still creeps me out.

10:51.303 --> 10:53.388
All right, let's get real.

10:53.757 --> 10:55.765
You ever jerk off to JTT?

10:56.720 --> 10:58.486
Jonathan Taylor Thomas?

10:58.493 --> 10:59.694
Yeah, I mean, all the time.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.162
As he was on "Home Improvement,"

11:01.168 --> 11:03.765
that poreless, olive skin?

11:03.771 --> 11:05.333
Or as he is now, a present day,

11:05.339 --> 11:07.689
31-year-old actor?

11:08.931 --> 11:10.471
Oh, no.

11:10.477 --> 11:12.891
I've been jerking off to a
teenager every other night.

11:12.898 --> 11:15.242
And are you a creep? Are you a criminal?

11:15.249 --> 11:17.278
We're all jerking off to teenagers.

11:17.284 --> 11:19.743
And I'll tell you what,
they're jerking off to us too.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.417
That's the circle of life.

11:22.423 --> 11:24.452
When you say it like that,
it's not creepy at all.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.742
Yes, dude.

11:25.749 --> 11:27.088
Jerking off is all we got.

11:27.094 --> 11:28.489
It literally saves the world.

11:29.151 --> 11:30.725
Thank you.

11:36.704 --> 11:38.373
♪ It's for the look ♪

11:38.380 --> 11:39.592
♪ I don't light it ♪

11:39.599 --> 11:40.660
Love it.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.816
- Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.
- Don't...

11:43.823 --> 11:44.872
Don't even, it's...

11:44.878 --> 11:46.878
I'm a grown man,
so I should have more control

11:46.885 --> 11:48.209
over my pelvic flow, that's all.

11:48.215 --> 11:51.263
No, farts are part of the
total relationship package.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.528
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

11:52.535 --> 11:54.682
Watch this.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.854
Yes!

12:06.300 --> 12:09.797
Yeah. This is like a breakdance
battle, but not at all.

12:15.269 --> 12:17.205
That was different from the others.

12:17.211 --> 12:19.246
All good. Excuse me one sec.

12:23.751 --> 12:26.025
Hey, Ilana, have some perspective.

12:26.032 --> 12:29.368
You shat yourself at a
party five weeks ago.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.491
Hey, sorry about those
last few things I said.

12:36.497 --> 12:38.180
That sort of came out weird.

12:38.187 --> 12:39.327
It's fine.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.629
If we met right now,
you'd just be, like,

12:41.635 --> 12:44.165
a hot dude who happens to teach.

12:44.608 --> 12:46.076
All right.

12:47.007 --> 12:49.336
This is, um, actually pretty good.

12:49.343 --> 12:51.339
Yes, this is, uh, it's amazing.

12:51.345 --> 12:54.709
Got sort of a full body
with a tannic grip.

12:54.715 --> 12:57.312
Yeah, I... I love...

12:57.318 --> 12:59.629
full bodies with tannic grips.

13:00.229 --> 13:02.692
I love those things with my wine.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.947
- What do you mean?
- Oh, just,

13:05.954 --> 13:07.288
what you said.

13:07.294 --> 13:08.786
I was like, "Yep, mm-hmm, me too."

13:08.793 --> 13:10.394
Yeah.

13:13.634 --> 13:16.531
His and hers casket sheets.

13:16.537 --> 13:18.933
This is amazing...

13:18.939 --> 13:21.841
Oh, I forgot to tell you

13:21.848 --> 13:23.830
we have brunch with Abbi
and Jaimé on Saturday.

13:23.837 --> 13:27.634
Oh, I can't, I already
have golf with Dr. Tims.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.793
Okay, I guess we have to make
a shared Google Calendar now

13:31.800 --> 13:33.614
so we don't double-book all the time.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.190
Sounds like a great idea.
I love Google Calendar.

13:44.765 --> 13:46.233
"Current events..."

13:52.160 --> 13:54.702
It's all good. Ay, Dios mío.

13:59.862 --> 14:01.976
That's not good. Books...

14:02.823 --> 14:04.158
Ay!

14:05.048 --> 14:06.280
Ay, stop it! My stitches!

14:06.286 --> 14:09.384
My stitches! Please! Please!

14:09.941 --> 14:11.909
Ah, hello, Europe.

14:26.473 --> 14:28.736
I really enjoy Monet's
early impressionism.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.538
I mean, I was reading about his process

14:30.544 --> 14:32.607
- in "The New Yorker"...
- Hold on a second.

14:32.613 --> 14:33.963
You read "The New Yorker"?

14:33.970 --> 14:35.825
Yeah, a lot.

14:35.832 --> 14:37.345
Wow, like, the whole thing?

14:38.335 --> 14:40.415
Yeah. Yeah, I usually get through it.

14:41.359 --> 14:43.351
That's so hot. That's, like,

14:43.919 --> 14:45.254
super sexy.

14:46.439 --> 14:47.841
That I can read?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.304
"Pretend like it's day one."

14:59.039 --> 15:02.036
Pretend like it's day one.

15:02.042 --> 15:05.940
Damn, reading is so dope.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.162
Calling Dr. Rice. I have a bad cavity

15:35.169 --> 15:36.537
that needs to get drill...

15:42.390 --> 15:44.259
Wake up!

15:45.325 --> 15:48.223
Okay, so we have to talk about
this whole relationship thing.

15:48.230 --> 15:50.025
- What?
- Think about what we have sacrificed

15:50.031 --> 15:53.141
to enter this sexless fart party.

15:53.148 --> 15:54.847
When was the last time we even had sex?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.383
We had sex an hour ago.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.952
And that's good enough for you?

15:58.686 --> 16:00.325
I... I... I can't.

16:03.445 --> 16:06.214
Told you I have a refractory period.

16:10.051 --> 16:12.254
- Oh, good. Chess pieces.
- There's chess pieces.

16:15.834 --> 16:19.065
Looks like somebody
didn't do her homework.

16:19.485 --> 16:20.980
Wait, what?

16:21.771 --> 16:23.512
Ohh... Yeah.

16:23.519 --> 16:24.748
Um, I didn't.

16:24.755 --> 16:27.018
But, I don't know, is there any...

16:27.469 --> 16:30.099
extra credit I can do
to bring my grade up?

16:30.105 --> 16:31.554
I don't think so.

16:31.561 --> 16:34.557
Looks like you're getting a big,
fat "D" this semester.

16:43.242 --> 16:45.204
Jaimé, don't get hard.

16:45.211 --> 16:47.041
Okay, I gotta hash this out.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.232
Like, are we aiming at forever?

16:49.239 --> 16:51.836
- That seems ridiculous.
- No.

16:51.843 --> 16:54.907
It's cra... I don't wanna
do anything forever.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.911
I like spaghetti, but I don't
wanna die with spaghetti.

16:57.918 --> 16:59.655
I mean, I might, but I don't know yet.

16:59.662 --> 17:01.149
I wanna take this one day at a time,

17:01.156 --> 17:02.479
the same way I take spaghetti.

17:02.572 --> 17:06.369
Yeah, 'cause a lifetime
sounds ominous and scary.

17:06.377 --> 17:09.037
Yeah, 'cause lifetime implies death.

17:09.044 --> 17:10.323
Think about it like this.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.507
Let's say you won a
lifetime supply of Doritos.

17:12.513 --> 17:14.376
- I'm listening.
- At first you'd be psyched,

17:14.382 --> 17:15.637
you got all these Doritos.

17:15.645 --> 17:16.727
Then after a while,

17:16.733 --> 17:18.847
every time you went to
grab a bag of Doritos,

17:18.854 --> 17:20.170
you're like, "Oh, I wanna die."

17:20.176 --> 17:22.451
So this is what I propose.

17:22.457 --> 17:25.253
We do it for a year, short-term.

17:25.260 --> 17:28.124
And then after that year,
we check in with each other.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.292
See how it's going,
like a phone contract.

17:30.298 --> 17:31.927
God, I love that.

17:31.933 --> 17:33.496
'Cause I can do that.

17:33.503 --> 17:35.169
And thank you for all
the food metaphors.

17:35.176 --> 17:36.176
You're welcome.

17:36.183 --> 17:37.967
I was eating spaghetti
and Doritos yesterday.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.935
That's probably why my
farts smell so violent.

17:39.941 --> 17:40.962
Right.

17:40.969 --> 17:42.862
I'm gonna avoid that
combination in the future.

17:42.869 --> 17:44.746
I'd really appreciate that.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.897
Jaimé, be strong.

17:53.904 --> 17:56.110
Penis, be weak. Be weak!

17:56.117 --> 17:57.429
Weak!

17:58.634 --> 18:02.850
Should we be doing this?
You're so young.

18:03.107 --> 18:04.895
I mean, I'm 28.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.770
No, but you're, like, 17, right?

18:10.437 --> 18:13.501
Yeah... I am only 17.

18:13.508 --> 18:16.572
Yeah, like, you don't
even know how to drive.

18:16.578 --> 18:19.441
No, I just got my license.

18:19.758 --> 18:22.194
I mean, it's actually just my permit.

18:27.796 --> 18:29.802
There you are, Abbi.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.641
Hold on. Get off, get off.

18:31.648 --> 18:33.136
- Sorry.
- Okay, um...

18:33.143 --> 18:34.672
Were you just pulling my skin back

18:34.679 --> 18:38.076
so I looked more like a child?

18:38.083 --> 18:41.347
We were roleplaying, right?
Like you're 17.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.083
I was trying to make you look young-ish.

18:43.090 --> 18:44.319
What the fuck?

18:44.326 --> 18:45.887
- Okay, no more!
- Wow! Oh, my...

18:45.894 --> 18:47.956
Excuse me! Excuse me!

18:48.402 --> 18:50.379
Jaimé! Why are you in here right now?

18:50.386 --> 18:51.587
Well, I'm so sorry, okay?

18:51.594 --> 18:53.510
But I was trying to hide
in the children's room

18:53.517 --> 18:54.586
so I wouldn't get hard.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.274
But that, sir, that was just disgusting.

18:56.281 --> 18:57.617
I hope you know that. Disgusting.

18:57.624 --> 19:00.449
Yeah, you know what, Richard?
That was disgusting, for one.

19:00.455 --> 19:03.219
For two, I exfoliate, like,
almost every other day.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.802
And you know what? My skin is radiant.

19:04.809 --> 19:07.499
I don't know that much to be true,
but I know this much to be true.

19:07.529 --> 19:09.591
Abbi, skincare is challenging.

19:09.598 --> 19:11.316
- Oh, my God.
- But we were roleplaying.

19:11.323 --> 19:13.583
All right, well, that's it.

19:14.129 --> 19:16.007
I'm gonna leave you two alone, okay?

19:16.014 --> 19:17.535
But first, I want to thank you.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.971
That image will forever harden my soul

19:19.978 --> 19:21.441
but soften my peepee.

19:21.448 --> 19:23.444
Namaste, you sick, sick man.

19:23.512 --> 19:27.309
Find a reason to leave,
thank you, excuse us.

19:31.831 --> 19:33.832
Look, Abbi, it takes two to Bumble.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.195
- Yeah.
- I'm not your teacher.

19:35.202 --> 19:36.587
- You're not my student.
- Okay.

19:36.594 --> 19:38.053
We're...

19:39.558 --> 19:41.454
- Oh, my Gosh.
- Uh, single file!

19:41.461 --> 19:43.024
Single file? I'm only one person.

19:43.031 --> 19:45.149
Use the buddy system!

19:48.114 --> 19:49.521
All right, roll call.

19:49.528 --> 19:51.088
I think it's... I think we can see

19:51.095 --> 19:52.990
that we're all here, it's fine.

19:52.997 --> 19:54.470
All clear.

19:55.768 --> 19:57.324
Dryer set fire.

19:57.331 --> 19:58.878
It's a Newton Elite.

19:58.885 --> 20:01.237
It's built only to dry satins, silk,

20:01.244 --> 20:03.180
or gold-infused fabrics.

20:03.187 --> 20:06.239
Looks like you guys are drying
cheap cotton and polyester here.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.904
Fire was inevitable.

20:07.911 --> 20:09.252
Thank you, sorry.

20:10.526 --> 20:13.556
Oh, it's Heidi. Okay. Okay, it's okay.

20:14.151 --> 20:15.620
Hey, Heidi.

20:15.627 --> 20:18.281
Yeah, it was a small dryer fire.

20:20.291 --> 20:21.297
Great!

20:21.303 --> 20:23.399
Enjoy the Hamptons,
and I'll talk to you soon.

20:24.513 --> 20:25.544
Um,

20:25.856 --> 20:27.813
she didn't even know
there was a laundry room.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.424
Uh, doesn't affect her in any way.

20:29.431 --> 20:30.945
- Wow.
- That must be nice.

20:30.952 --> 20:32.283
You wanna head back inside?

20:32.290 --> 20:35.931
Um... I don't think so.

20:35.938 --> 20:38.581
Thanks for coming over.
It was... interesting.

20:39.894 --> 20:42.157
- Goodbye, Abbi.
- 'Kay.

20:45.441 --> 20:46.976
Richard, wait.

20:50.343 --> 20:52.002
Do you...

20:53.798 --> 20:55.572
jerk off to your students?

20:56.228 --> 20:57.700
All teachers do.

20:58.447 --> 21:00.016
You kinda have to.

21:02.811 --> 21:04.841
Hey, Abbi, one more thing.

21:05.567 --> 21:07.680
You have to keep reading.

21:07.687 --> 21:09.681
Your brain is a muscle.

21:09.876 --> 21:11.581
If you don't use it regularly...

21:12.880 --> 21:14.472
it goes away.

21:15.268 --> 21:16.836
What a righteous dude.

21:23.423 --> 21:26.298
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

21:29.236 --> 21:30.996
I get carded almost all the time.

21:31.003 --> 21:34.565
Like, almost every time there's,
like, an age limit, I'm questioned.

21:34.572 --> 21:35.958
I bet... Because people think

21:35.965 --> 21:37.889
I'm... way younger.

21:37.896 --> 21:40.833
Yeah, definitely ten
years ago, I'm sure.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.624
I mean, for sure.

21:47.955 --> 21:51.206
We all started, I mean,
you know, just specifically

21:51.213 --> 21:54.642
Hannibal, Arturo, and us,
none of us had any experience.

21:54.649 --> 21:56.139
We didn't have like TV experience.

21:56.146 --> 21:57.621
We're working on Broad City all year,

21:57.628 --> 21:59.608
but Hannibal and Arturo
are going and acting on

21:59.615 --> 22:01.986
different things and I
really felt their experience

22:01.993 --> 22:04.222
come back to the set and feed the set.

22:04.229 --> 22:06.992
It's good to see everybody,
it's good to see just how

22:06.999 --> 22:09.768
they've grown as actors

22:09.775 --> 22:12.537
as business women, as creators.

22:12.544 --> 22:14.899
They're both directing episodes now.

22:14.906 --> 22:16.405
It's been great to see a progression.

22:16.411 --> 22:18.119
Jaime, be strong.

22:18.126 --> 22:20.241
Penis, be weak.

22:20.584 --> 22:21.986
Be weak!

22:22.150 --> 22:24.847
They're so talented,
both of them in their own

22:24.854 --> 22:27.424
individual ways,
and I hope that we keep writing

22:27.431 --> 22:30.619
to their strengths, but their
strengths keep expanding.

22:30.625 --> 22:34.156
And I feel like I learn
more about how good

22:34.162 --> 22:35.624
they were from directing them.

22:35.630 --> 22:38.630
Okay, so we have to talk about
this whole relationship thing.

22:38.637 --> 22:39.798
- What?
- Think about what

22:39.805 --> 22:43.165
we have sacrificed to enter
this sexless fart party!

22:43.171 --> 22:45.568
People get emotionally
invested with characters.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.403
I've done it before
with a television show.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.659
When somebody break up,
I'd be like they broke up!

22:49.666 --> 22:52.928
I can't believe it,
I want them to get back together.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.345
Hello my dear!

22:56.351 --> 22:58.714
Hello, my um,

22:58.720 --> 23:00.549
my fluid dude!

23:00.555 --> 23:02.218
They never really doubted

23:02.224 --> 23:05.488
that I'd be back and then,
I didn't, but I think

23:05.494 --> 23:08.724
the fans just really
thought I was off the show.

23:08.730 --> 23:11.394
He's my boyfriend.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.854
I'm having sex with a girl
and afterwards she's like

23:13.861 --> 23:15.631
"so you know if you gonna be back?"

23:15.637 --> 23:18.367
And hey, this isn't the time
for that, first of all.

23:18.373 --> 23:20.369
This is not what we're
here for, this is not

23:20.375 --> 23:23.739
a meet and greet,
this is not an interview.

23:24.227 --> 23:27.109
I don't want to talk
storylines with you right now

23:27.115 --> 23:29.317
I just met you four hours ago.

23:30.305 --> 23:36.883
