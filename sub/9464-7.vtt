remembers his gym uniform,
I mean how hard can it be?

00:05.083 --> 00:07.333
-Yeah, he was in my class
for years. Bad kid.
-[Bobbi]: Yeah.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.333
-[Simon]: Type B personality.
-[Bobbi]: Yes.

00:09.375 --> 00:12.375
-Oh, tell me about it. He's
never returned a library
book on time. Not once!

00:12.417 --> 00:14.542
-[Bobbi]: Ugh. the jerk.
-I buy that.
[Gerry]: Shut up.

00:14.583 --> 00:17.208
-[Emma]: Not once.
-Can you guys talk about
something other than school

00:17.250 --> 00:19.375
when you're in here?
-Excuse me?
-This is all you do.

00:19.417 --> 00:22.500
You come in at lunch, talk about
the students, the staff, the
school, the education system.

00:22.542 --> 00:25.875
I'm getting sick of it. I want
to eat my lunch. I don't want
to talk about that stuff.

00:25.917 --> 00:28.500
Talk about a movie or a
game or something.
-Gerry, we need to vent.

00:28.542 --> 00:30.750
This is our chance to
decompress.
-Oh, speaking of which,

00:30.792 --> 00:33.875
has anyone noticed that Harry
Jones has the worst halitosis?

00:33.917 --> 00:36.250
-Oh yes, yes! Are you
kidding me?
-[Bobbi]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.458
-Ugh, I call him Harry-tosis.
Harry-tosis Smith.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.875
-[Bobbi]: I had a student
once that had a...

00:43.208 --> 00:45.625
-There ya go. A little porn.
[Porn continues]

00:45.667 --> 00:49.375
-Is this disturbing you? Is this
helping you decompress, too?

00:49.417 --> 00:52.709
-[Porn continues]
-Thought that might work.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.834
-[Porn continues]

00:54.875 --> 00:58.750
-Ya know who got into porn?
Was little Shane O'Toole.
-[Emma]: No! Get out!

00:58.792 --> 01:01.208
-[Bobbi]: Yes! Can you believe
that?
-[Simon] No! Shane O'Toole?

01:01.250 --> 01:04.208
[Simon]: Is doing porn?
-I'm not telling you a lie.
Tool Time with Shane.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.542
That's what they called it.
-Hey Gerry?
[Porn continues]

01:06.583 --> 01:09.000

This is Leanne and Gloria.
They're student teachers.

They're going to be doing

you could get another teacher to
do this?

let me drop Gloria and get
Leanne back on team Duncan

02:02.291 --> 02:05.000

Gloria, you have Leanne.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.417
-Did we win the lottery with
these student teachers?

03:06.458 --> 03:08.959
-[Exhales]: Maybe the lottery
of overwhelming responsibility.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.166
-What are you talking about?
We're on cruise control for the
next two months.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.625
It's like a spare.
-Cruise control? Gerry?

03:14.667 --> 03:16.792
I'm not on cruise control,
I'm behind the wheel.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.291
And I'm panicking. Do you know
how much responsibility this is?

03:19.333 --> 03:22.792
We have to teach people
how to teach people.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.458
-You don't teach them anything,
they teach the class.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.041
Everything they need to learn
about teaching, they learned in
teachers college already.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.125
-Oh, nobody learns anything
in teachers college.

03:31.166 --> 03:34.542
-That's true. Very true.
-You learn from being thrown
into the inferno.

03:34.583 --> 03:37.041
And here we are.
This is their fire, Gerry.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.333
We've gotta teach them how
to evaluate, then evaluate
their evaluating.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.041
Then we get evaluated on how
we did evaluating them.

03:43.083 --> 03:45.250
Oh, what a nightmare!
-Are you nuts?

03:45.291 --> 03:50.792
-Am I? Or am I the only one
who truly sees the weight of
this responsibility?

03:50.834 --> 03:53.000
-I brought that book back
that you recommended.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.917
-Great, what'd you think?
-You know, I just couldn't
get into it.

03:55.959 --> 03:59.917
-Weird. It changed my life.
-Gosh, I found it so boring.

03:59.959 --> 04:02.250
Oh, here it is.
-Oh.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.250

That's cute.

a story where things happen.

04:11.375 --> 04:14.333
-Mmm hmm. Makes sense.
Oooh, the spine is broken.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.583
That's okay. Matches
the sun damage.

04:16.625 --> 04:20.041
-I left it in the windowsill and
one of my cats fell asleep on
it.

-Oh.
-Guess it put him to sleep too.

-Why?

-I just...I need you to stay.

05:08.417 --> 05:11.291
-If I stay you're not going to
get the full teaching
experience, right?

05:11.333 --> 05:14.166
That's how you learn. You jump
right into the fire, okay?
Sink or swim.

05:16.959 --> 05:19.667

in front of real kids before.

teaching in front of?

here.

and I really need you to stay.

I'll stay. I'll sit at the back,
but just for today.

Good morning, children.

07:29.166 --> 07:34.583
Today's story is called:
"The Rise and Fall of
Queen Leeza."

07:34.625 --> 07:37.834
We begin our story when
King Callaman dies

07:37.875 --> 07:41.166
and the throne was handed
to the wildly unqualified

07:41.208 --> 07:43.875
and boring Queen Leeza.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.834
Queen Leeza had no
respect for her minions

07:46.875 --> 07:50.375
and would punish and torture
them by breaking the spines

07:50.417 --> 07:53.083
of the most enlightened
among them, and sullying

07:53.125 --> 07:55.291
their most prized possessions.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.625
It was no wonder she could
never find a mate

07:57.667 --> 08:00.834
and was destined to
die alone and miserable,

08:00.875 --> 08:03.291
surrounded by her cats.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.458
-That woman is no fan of yours.

-Nope.

-You okay there, bud?
-Whatcha got there?

08:14.500 --> 08:17.000
-I'm taking my health a
little bit more seriously.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.375
'Cause I have a cousin who's
a bit of a health freak.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.834

too selfish with my body.

were just teasing.

08:27.834 --> 08:31.375
-It's true. By exercising so
much, I'm taking away from
my body,

08:31.417 --> 08:34.667

-Bobbi, you're in fine shape.

[Takes a deep breath]: But it's
under control now, so...

-You know there's such a thing
as too many supplements, right?

08:50.583 --> 08:52.750
-This is all natural, okay pal?

08:52.792 --> 08:56.125
It's got: Glutamine, Creatine
and Taurine. Boom!

08:56.166 --> 08:58.667
-It sounds very natural.
Very farm-to-table.

08:58.709 --> 09:02.417
-Oh, and a little bit of
caffeine, just to send
it to my body.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.834
Blah, what was that?

09:07.875 --> 09:09.417
Oooh, fun!

-Student teacher time,
this is the best, isn't it?

09:13.208 --> 09:15.333
-This is a nightmare.

-I knew that girl was too
hot to be good.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.291
-Are you kidding me?
She's perfect. Do you know
how stressful it is to

09:20.333 --> 09:23.583
try and improve upon perfection?
-If you're not going to enjoy
this, can you just leave?

09:23.625 --> 09:26.291
-She's mastered the lesson plan.
I'm killing myself trying to

09:26.333 --> 09:28.500
stay one step ahead of this
woman.
-Shut up.

09:28.542 --> 09:30.625

No, I've got one. I've got one.
-Next time, next time.

19:54.834 --> 19:57.166
-Ohhh, it's a good one.
-Save it for next time.

19:57.208 --> 20:00.166
-Let me recover a little bit.
-Oh, I don't know.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.458
That was a good set,
do it next...
-Next time! I'll be back.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.625
You make sure you all come back.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.250
This is a story, ah, about
Bobbi our Phys Ed teacher.

20:07.291 --> 20:11.333
[Whispers]: Just let me tell it
real quick. You know she
would...Oh God.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.625
There's other acts.
-Yeah, yeah, there's other acts.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.583
-Hey, thanks buddy!
Whoo.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.041
Eh...Ah...Ih.
-It was great.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.250
-Yeah.
-Thanks. They don't know Simon,
right?

20:22.291 --> 20:24.500
-[Bill]: Right. That's the
problem.
-They don't know Simon.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.875
So I was going off about Simon.
-That really held that set back.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.041
-And the girl before me,
like give me a break. Honestly.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.625
How am I supposed to do
something after she...'Cause
she got nothin'.

20:31.667 --> 20:34.000
-[Bill]: She had nothing.
-She had, like, charity
applause.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.500
I should have talked about you,
'cause they know you!

20:36.542 --> 20:38.917
Told them how horrible you were
as a teacher.

20:38.959 --> 20:42.458
And a stand up, I could
have talked about...Like
you couldn't do either.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.542
-You coulda, yeah...and the mic!
-[Gerry]: Did you see this mic?

20:45.583 --> 20:48.041
What is it, Fisher Price? Like
come on, give me a break.

20:48.083 --> 20:52.375
The sound guy.
Oh man. Thank you.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.750
-Yeah, yeah, that wasn't
embarrassing at all.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.917
-That was cool, I gotta admit.
That was fun.

20:56.959 --> 20:58.959
I don't know if I'll do it
again, but that was fun.
