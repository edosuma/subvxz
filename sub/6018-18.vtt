WEBVTT

00:03.436 --> 00:04.926
Remember the doorman strike?

00:05.105 --> 00:07.039
They have a union,
in the fancy buildings...

00:07.207 --> 00:08.469
...and they went on strike.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.735
You would think if any group of people
would not wanna demonstrate...

00:11.911 --> 00:16.007
...what life would be like without them,
it would be doormen.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.480
"Let's see how they do without us."

00:20.020 --> 00:23.353
There's no doorman,
people open the door, they walk in.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.354
Who's gonna walk out next?

00:25.525 --> 00:29.621
The guys that clean your windshield
at the traffic light with the dirty rag?

00:29.796 --> 00:33.732
"We demand shorter yellows
and longer reds."

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:46.446 --> 00:47.572
-May I help you?
-Yeah.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.578
I'm just going up
to see Elaine Benes.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.718
Benes. There's no one here
by that name.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.550
Oh, she's housesitting for Mr. Pitt.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.451
-Oh, housesitting?
-Yeah.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.455
What are you, the boyfriend?

00:59.626 --> 01:01.992
Here for a quickie?

01:04.931 --> 01:06.990
-Can I just go up?
-Oh, I get it.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.397
Why waste time making small talk
with the doorman?

01:09.569 --> 01:13.061
I should just shut up and do my job
opening the door for you.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.757
How about those Knicks?

01:33.660 --> 01:34.991
Oh, I see, on the sports page.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.595
Why do you think I wasn't
reading the Wall Street page?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.324
Oh, I know. Because I'm
the uneducated doorman.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.968
So you think your parents
will get back together?

01:47.140 --> 01:49.631
I hope so. I can't take him
living with me much longer.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.403
He makes this kasha,
it stinks up the whole house.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.979
-Hey, George, stick them up.
-What?

01:55.148 --> 01:57.844
For these German tourists.
Pretend that I'm robbing you.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.583
-Why?
-So these people can go back home...

02:00.753 --> 02:03.347
...and tell their friends they saw
a real New York mugging.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.047
It'll give them a thrill.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.658
All right, hands up, porky.

02:08.595 --> 02:11.223
That's it.
Now, give me your wallet.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.228
You got it in here, huh, fat boy?

02:14.567 --> 02:16.592
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you got?

02:16.769 --> 02:19.363
-All right, that's enough.
-I'll tell you when it's enough.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.836
All right, you better not say anything
or I'll stalk you.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.707
Where have you been?
We're gonna miss the movie. Let's go.

02:29.883 --> 02:34.013
I am not going back down there.
I can't face that guy again.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.916
-What guy?
-The doorman.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.080
I don't wanna play any more
of his mind games.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.987
-What time does he get off?
-Six.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.220
But then the night doorman comes on.
He's much scarier.

02:45.598 --> 02:48.465
Well, it's almost 6 now.
Can't we just wait till he goes home?

02:48.635 --> 02:50.933
-We'll still make the movie.
-Okay, okay.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.610
So, what did you do today, Dad?

03:00.780 --> 03:03.840
Today I went record shopping
in Greenwich Village.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.918
I bought this record,
but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.

03:07.086 --> 03:08.485
I don't have a hi-fi.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.055
-I gave you my old record player.
-I gave it to Cosmo.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.249
Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?

03:13.426 --> 03:14.586
I'm Cosmo.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.730
Well, I want it back.
I want to listen to that cha-cha record.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.964
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.625
All right, all right.
Can we go out and eat?

03:24.270 --> 03:26.431
Let me change my shirt.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.541
Jerry, it's 6, let's go.

03:35.715 --> 03:39.014
That doorman's
still milling around outside.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.585
He's very peculiar.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.518
-No, don't--
-Hello.

03:46.693 --> 03:50.026
-Oh, hi, Mr. Pitt.
-Give that to me.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.460
Hello, Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?

03:52.632 --> 03:54.395
Elaine, are you having a party?

03:54.567 --> 03:58.333
A party? Oh, no, that was
just my stupid friend, Jerry.

03:58.504 --> 03:59.766
He just left. We can go.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.237
There's to be no entertaining
while I'm gone.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.808
Believe me, we're not entertained.
We're just leaving.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.141
-Grab those empty bottles for me.
-I need to know what's in the mail.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.147
<i>Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really
nothing that can't wait.</i>

04:11.317 --> 04:14.184
-We're trying to catch a movie.
-<i>Well, catch the later show.</i>

04:14.354 --> 04:16.185
I need to know what's in the mail.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.748
All right.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.992
I can't go.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.930
The new <i>TIME</i> magazine.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.775
-The new <i>People</i>.
-<i>Oh, who's on the cover?</i>

04:37.844 --> 04:39.641
Hey, buddy.

04:40.346 --> 04:43.838
You? What are you doing here?
You work at this building too?

04:44.017 --> 04:46.008
Oh, sure.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.914
Poor doorman has to work
two jobs...

04:48.087 --> 04:50.817
...to put food on the table
for mother and baby.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.753
No, I live here.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.458
That's okay, isn't it?

04:54.627 --> 04:57.425
So you work all day as a doorman
at one building...

04:57.597 --> 04:59.531
...and then you stand outside
your building?

04:59.699 --> 05:02.463
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

05:02.635 --> 05:06.264
Look, I'm not going in your building.
I really don't have to talk to you.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.701
Goodbye.

05:08.174 --> 05:11.473
You really think
you're better than me, don't you?

05:12.178 --> 05:14.078
So my father opened his shirt....

05:15.748 --> 05:18.979
-Yeah, and?
-Tell him, Kramer.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.544
He had breasts.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.495
-What do you mean, breasts?
-Big breasts.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.831
So what?
A lot of older men have that.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.968
No, not these.
These were real hooters.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.141
I was throwing up all night.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.703
It was like my own personal
<i>Crying Game</i>.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.380
You know, maybe you're
gonna get them too, George.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.389
Yeah, that's right.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.924
What if it's a genetic thing?
Like father, like son.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.459
But your father's not bald.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.220
No, no. That skips a generation.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.558
The baldness gene
comes from your grandfather.

06:06.733 --> 06:10.066
Then I suppose the bosom gene
comes from your grandmother?

06:11.904 --> 06:15.567
Frank can't be too comfortable
with those things clanging around.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.609
He should wear something
for support.

06:19.078 --> 06:21.979
-You mean, like a bra?
-No, a bra is for ladies.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.446
I'm talking about
a support undergarment...

06:24.617 --> 06:27.609
...specifically designed for men.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.421
Boy, that brain never
stops working, does it?

06:31.924 --> 06:35.553
That's right.
I'm gonna go noodle with this.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.097
Hey, we're twins.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.497
What?!

06:44.370 --> 06:45.962
Our shirts, they're the same.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.106
Imagine that.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.342
What? What did you say
to the doorman?

06:54.747 --> 06:55.839
What? Nothing.

06:56.015 --> 07:00.418
He claims that you followed him home
and started harassing him.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.986
What, does this guy got
a personal vendetta with me?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.750
What did I do to him? Because
I asked him about the Knicks?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.415
-Hey, did you make the movie?
-No.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.390
You wanna go tonight?
You can pick me up.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.998
All right. Can we go to a later show
so he's off his shift when I come by?

07:13.166 --> 07:17.296
So now we have to rearrange our lives
to avoid the doorman?

07:17.470 --> 07:19.597
Yes, we do.

07:24.243 --> 07:26.336
What is wrong with George?

07:26.813 --> 07:30.010
He's trying to get something
off his chest.

07:31.250 --> 07:36.017
All right. I gotta try and talk my mother
into taking him off my hands.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.949
Help you?

07:42.562 --> 07:44.860
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be gone.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.592
I traded shifts with the night doorman.
He had personal affairs to attend to.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.895
My fellow doormen and l
watch out for each other.

07:51.070 --> 07:54.062
We don't stab each other in the back
like people in your world.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.537
Look, I don't want any trouble.

07:57.710 --> 08:01.908
I don't have a doorman in my building.
I guess I'm not used to talking to them.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.845
-I'd really just like to be friends.
-You wanna be friends?

08:05.251 --> 08:06.946
I'd like to be.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.950
-Then watch the door for a minute.
-What?

08:09.121 --> 08:11.214
I just want to get a beer.
Be back in a minute.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.790
-Wait a second. What do I do?
-It's not brain surgery.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.157
Open the door for people.
If they don't live here, don't let them in.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.627
Here.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.560
Wear this.

08:33.546 --> 08:34.774
Hey, hey, wait a second.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.245
Hey! Hello!

08:38.618 --> 08:41.212
-Wait a second, you live here?
-Of course I live here.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.251
I've lived here for 20 years.
Now, if you don't let me in...

08:44.423 --> 08:46.823
...I'm going to call the police
and have you arrested.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.252
All right. All right.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.894
You think you're better than me?

09:21.427 --> 09:24.123
-You gotta sign for it.
-Oh, right, right.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.834
Hey, how about those Knicks, huh?

09:34.173 --> 09:36.107
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.588
Hey, I brought back
your record player.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.193
Oh, thank you, Kramer.
Put it over there.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.930
Oh, boy. Yeah.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.624
-So how you feeling?
-A little tired.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.829
-Does your back hurt?
-How did you know?

10:06.005 --> 10:09.463
Well, it's obvious. You're carrying
a lot of extra baggage up there.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.872
-Up here?
-Oh, yeah, top floor.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.139
Listen, Frank...

10:15.314 --> 10:17.714
...you ever considered
wearing something for support?

10:18.284 --> 10:21.720
Now, look at this.
Mind you, this is just a prototype.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.650
-You want me to wear a bra?
-No, no.

10:23.823 --> 10:28.385
A bra is for ladies.
Meet the Bro.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.394
So is your father excited
about coming home?

10:37.503 --> 10:39.164
George.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.865
Hey, Mom, what kind of woman
was Grandma?

10:44.043 --> 10:46.637
All of a sudden you're interested
in your grandmother?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.803
Well, you know,
you get to a certain point...

10:48.981 --> 10:50.846
...you want to know
about your roots.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.978
-Well, she was a lovely woman.
-Yeah.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.912
-What about physically?
-Physically?

10:58.090 --> 11:01.548
-You know, what did she look like?
-Well, you've seen pictures.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.718
Well, you can't tell much
from those pictures.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.693
Tell what?

11:09.268 --> 11:10.929
Was she...?

11:11.103 --> 11:14.300
-Was she a big woman?
-Big? No.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.997
She was my height.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.939
-Bosomy?
-Bosomy?

11:19.111 --> 11:22.376
You want to know
if your grandmother was bosomy?

11:23.149 --> 11:26.175
I was just wondering.
The information could be relevant.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.912
Where do you get your genes from?

11:29.088 --> 11:31.249
That's what I'd like to know.

11:33.159 --> 11:36.424
-I can't believe you left your post.
-He left me there.

11:36.595 --> 11:38.426
You see the mind games?

11:41.434 --> 11:43.595
Hey, what's going on here?

11:43.769 --> 11:46.101
Somebody stole the couch
out of the lobby.

11:48.574 --> 11:49.802
Where's the doorman?

11:49.975 --> 11:51.806
How come someone wasn't
watching the door?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.176
-Jerry, let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.758
Oh, my God.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.969
-Why were you watching the door?
-He asked me to.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.805
We were getting along.

12:26.979 --> 12:29.379
You know, my fingerprints
are all over this.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.413
That doorman knows
you're a friend of mine.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.745
He'll tell that co-op lady.
She'll tell Mr. Pitt.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.251
Jerry, I'm in this too deep.

12:36.622 --> 12:39.750
Don't you find it odd that as soon
as he leaves, a couch gets stolen?

12:39.925 --> 12:42.052
-Maybe he's setting me up.
-All right. Shut up.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.253
Just let me think. I gotta think.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.096
We gotta get our story straight.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.597
-All right. What if we say--?
-All right. Here it is.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.065
This is what we'll tell them.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.466
-You came to pick me up.
-I came to pick you up.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.032
-Yeah, that's what I said.
-No, I was just....

12:56.208 --> 12:59.541
-No, I know. It's not helping.
-All right. Well, just start again.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.807
-Okay. You came to pick me up--
-Right.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.846
-You see? Again.
-What? I said, "Right."

13:08.888 --> 13:12.119
All right, you came right upstairs
without talking to the doorman.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.088
But the doorman's gonna
say I was there.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.956
So what? No one's gonna
believe a doorman.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.662
-I don't know if this is gonna work.
-Stick with the story. We'll be fine.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.323
-Let me do the talking.
-Okay.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.162
Good. Now fix me a drink.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.734
How's that feel?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.908
-This feels very comfortable.
-You see?

13:30.075 --> 13:32.669
-I feel 10 years younger.
-And your posture's a lot better.

13:32.845 --> 13:33.937
Look at you.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.104
-And I can breathe easier too.
-I told you.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.011
Frank, listen,
here's what I'm thinking.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.312
-You have a friend in the bra business.
-Of course. Sid Farkus.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.852
He's the best in the business.

13:43.022 --> 13:47.322
It's our chance. What do you say?
It'll be me, you and the Bro, bro.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.321
Let's do it.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.596
Except we gotta do something
about the name.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.494
-Why? What's wrong with Bro?
-Bro is no good. Too ethnic.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.761
-You got something better?
-How about the....

13:58.237 --> 14:00.671
The Mansiere.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.036
-Mansiere?
-That's right.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.237
A brassiere for a man.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.903
The Mansiere. Get it?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.443
Well, you scared her off.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.916
We may never see Mom again.

14:15.087 --> 14:20.787
Hey, George, what do you like better,
the Bro or the Mansiere?

14:25.865 --> 14:30.393
Dad, we need to talk.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.766
I had to use the bathroom...

14:33.939 --> 14:36.533
...so I asked this guy to watch
the door for a few minutes.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.143
Why should I believe you?

14:39.545 --> 14:43.072
Actually, it was her friend.

14:44.116 --> 14:48.746
I was just speaking to the doorman
here about the couch robbery.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.947
Oh, really? The doorman.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.725
And pray tell,
what did the doorman say?

14:54.894 --> 14:58.455
He said he asked a friend of yours
to watch the door.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.996
Oh, my.

15:00.165 --> 15:04.499
Well, the doorman certainly has
a wild imagination, doesn't he?

15:04.670 --> 15:07.138
Well, what do we have here?

15:07.306 --> 15:09.137
Perhaps Ms. Benes can explain...

15:09.308 --> 15:13.802
...why a Jerry Seinfeld signed
for this package...

15:13.979 --> 15:16.846
...at the exact same time
the couch was stolen.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.752
He'd never watched
a door before, Mrs. Payton.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.218
He didn't know how to do it.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.186
You know, he's a comedian,
Mrs. Payton.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.552
They don't know how
to do anything.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.555
Don't you see what's going on here?
He set us up.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.858
He's playing all these mind games.

15:36.902 --> 15:40.133
-They're saying I'm responsible?
-There was nothing I could do.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.934
He had a Federal Express slip
with your signature on it.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.869
Diabolical.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.140
He thought of everything.
He was setting me up from day one.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.782
Is it possible we were victims
of a sting?

15:51.450 --> 15:55.352
I'm sure he's having a good laugh
over this with his doorman buddies.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.986
So you didn't even want the couch?

16:00.159 --> 16:02.992
No, I was just messing
with his head.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.989
And they think
they're better than us.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.134
Anyway, Jerry-- Jerry.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.796
-We have to replace the couch.
-Now we have to buy a new couch?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.773
Not necessarily.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.002
Why don't you take back
the couch you gave me?

16:21.180 --> 16:23.375
-The one with the Poppie stain?
-Yeah, sure.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.608
Then my father will have
no place to sleep.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.752
He's gotta move out.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.512
But it's got a pee stain on it.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.747
Well, the cushion's turned over.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.789
-I guess.
-Yeah.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.859
You get a couch,
I get rid of my father.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.518
It couldn't be more perfect.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.689
-Now, it's call the Bro.
-Or the Mansiere.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.529
-Yeah, but I prefer the Bro.
-I like Mansiere.

16:44.703 --> 16:49.231
Well, I have to tell you,
it's a very interesting idea.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.036
You know, selling bras
exclusively to women...

16:52.644 --> 16:55.442
...we're really only utilizing
50 percent of the market.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.411
-That's what we figured.
-I told you.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.952
And to be perfectly frank, I've always
felt I could use some support.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.317
I know when I'm wearing Ban-Lon...

17:06.125 --> 17:08.787
...there appears to be some jiggling.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.820
I wouldn't be caught dead
in Ban-Lon.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.588
So, what do you see in the back?
Hooks? Velcro?

17:14.767 --> 17:16.791
-Definitely Velcro.
-Oh, yeah.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.869
Say you're getting intimate
with a woman...

17:20.039 --> 17:22.701
...you don't want her fumbling
and struggling back there.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.202
I think we've all experienced that.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.251
Summer nights.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.593
I still have to talk about this
to Mr. De Granmont...

17:41.760 --> 17:43.751
...but barring any unforeseen
developments...

17:43.929 --> 17:46.056
...gentlemen, I think
we're sitting on a winner.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.220
Good.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.459
Frank, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am...

17:50.636 --> 17:52.729
...to hear about you and Estelle
separating.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.770
Thank you, Sid,
but that's all in the past.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.771
I'm ready to move on.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.706
I've always been very fond
of Estelle.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.903
Beautiful woman.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.842
I hope you don't think
this is out of line...

18:06.018 --> 18:08.816
...but would it be okay with you
if I were to ask her out?

18:10.022 --> 18:12.013
You want to go out with my wife?

18:12.191 --> 18:14.022
Where do you get the nerve
to ask me that?

18:14.193 --> 18:15.182
No, I'm just saying--

18:15.360 --> 18:17.351
I know what you're saying
and thinking.

18:17.529 --> 18:18.757
-No, Frank--
-Come on, Cosmo.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.059
-I'm not doing business with this guy.
-Come on. Frank. Frank!

18:22.234 --> 18:23.826
Frank!

18:25.571 --> 18:28.438
-Jerry took the couch back.
-He took it back?

18:28.607 --> 18:31.770
-Didn't you tell him I was using it?
-Oh, I pleaded with him.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.300
Where do I sleep?

18:33.479 --> 18:35.743
Well, I took the liberty
of packing your things.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.643
Mom's coming to get you.

18:37.816 --> 18:41.115
I thought Jerry didn't want
that couch because of the stain.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.913
-What stain?
-Oh, you didn't notice?

18:43.088 --> 18:45.113
It has a pee stain.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.425
You had me sleeping
on a pee-stained couch?

18:48.594 --> 18:50.152
No.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.456
No, no. The cushion
was turned over.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.794
But the very idea.
You had me lying in urine!

18:58.971 --> 19:00.871
There's Mom. There's Mom.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.072
-Is it safe to come in?
-Oh, of course. Of course.

19:04.243 --> 19:07.508
You're not having any
of your transvestite parties?

19:07.679 --> 19:08.805
Will you stop it?

19:09.114 --> 19:11.173
I lived with him for 40 years.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.511
I never saw him trying on
my underwear.

19:13.685 --> 19:18.782
As soon as he leaves the house,
he turns into J. Edgar Hoover.

19:22.194 --> 19:25.391
Here, Cosmo, you can have the hi-fi.
I don't need it now.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.498
-I got one at home.
-All right. Let's go.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.534
-We'll go out for dinner tonight.
-I can't tonight. I'm busy.

19:31.703 --> 19:32.863
What do you mean, busy?

19:33.038 --> 19:36.007
-I'm having dinner with someone.
-With whom?

19:37.142 --> 19:39.167
Sid Farkus.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.107
Sid Farkus?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.339
You're not having dinner
with a bra salesman.

19:43.515 --> 19:47.144
Hey, he only sells them,
he doesn't wear them.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.322
Okay. That's it.
I'm not coming home.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.783
But you can't stay here.
There's no place to sleep.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.393
We'll work something out.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.368
Stop him!

20:10.542 --> 20:12.635
Yeah, yeah, it's him.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.076
Stop that man! It's him!

20:16.248 --> 20:18.614
Somebody stop him!

20:19.084 --> 20:20.984
Please, quick.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.917
Stop! It's him! I know. I know.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.182
Help! Stop him!

20:26.358 --> 20:28.223
Hey, that record player
is not yours.

20:28.393 --> 20:32.090
-No, look, somebody gave it to me.
-You're a thief. We have proof.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.357
What is that?

20:35.767 --> 20:38.099
It's the first upper-body
support undergarment...

20:38.270 --> 20:39.828
...specifically designed for men.

20:40.005 --> 20:42.132
How does it connect in the back?
With a hook?

20:42.307 --> 20:45.674
Oh, no, no, no. Here. Velcro.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.720
Well, I suppose it will have to do.

20:57.889 --> 21:01.325
-It's a beautiful couch.
-It's hardly been used.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.724
Poppie.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.763
Oh, hello, Jerry.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.992
-What are you doing here?
-Visiting my friend.

21:10.168 --> 21:13.501
-Hey, how you feeling?
-Much better. Much better.

21:13.672 --> 21:17.699
The doctors are saying
I cannot have no aggravation...

21:17.876 --> 21:20.106
...so I sell the restaurant.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.543
I just take it easy.

21:22.714 --> 21:27.879
See, if I get excited,
that's aggravated my condition.

21:28.053 --> 21:32.251
The last time I got aggravated
was in the restaurant...

21:32.424 --> 21:34.119
...with your friend.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.820
She started a big fight
about abortion.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.958
It's you.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.726
-It's you.
-What?

21:43.902 --> 21:47.099
You-- l-- l--

21:47.272 --> 21:48.330
I gotta sit down.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.566
-No, Poppie, no!
-No, Poppie!

22:17.002 --> 22:19.061
Kasha?

22:27.212 --> 22:29.146
No, thanks, Dad.
