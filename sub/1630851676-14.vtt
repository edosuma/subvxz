WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.265
I serve as an equalizer.

00:04.439 --> 00:06.093
I'm the one you call
when you can't call 911.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.920
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:08.095 --> 00:10.401
Does the name Mason Quinn
mean anything to you?

00:10.575 --> 00:11.924
I was promised
that he would spend

00:12.099 --> 00:13.665
the rest of his miserable life
locked up.

00:13.839 --> 00:14.884
Who promised you that?

00:15.058 --> 00:16.233
How could you lie to me,

00:16.407 --> 00:17.321
when you knew
I should have known?

00:17.495 --> 00:19.193
Well, when it comes to Quinn,

00:19.367 --> 00:21.064
you're just a little bit
obsessed, aren't you?

00:21.195 --> 00:22.065
QUINN Good to know
you're still in play.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.501
I'm gonna get you again.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.981
And this time,
I'm gonna kill you.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.765
Everything I could dig up
on Mason Quinn

00:26.896 --> 00:28.463
since the CIA
let him go.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.682
Uh, word of advice:
don't open it.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.075
It's not your problem anymore.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.164
I'm looking for
Viola Marsette?

00:34.338 --> 00:36.645
I have a sketch
I want to ask you about.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.429
The woman in that portrait,

00:38.560 --> 00:39.952
she was more than a friend.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.650
It wasn't something
that could survive

00:41.780 --> 00:42.825
the real world,

00:42.999 --> 00:44.653
as the world was then.

00:46.655 --> 00:47.786
I don't know you,

00:47.917 --> 00:49.310
but if Marcus
trusted you,

00:49.484 --> 00:50.572
then I trust you, too.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.226
Please find him.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.618
Yes! I need a airlift.
Officer down.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.490
You are a good cop.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.753
I can't be a good cop if
I don't know why I'm doing it.

00:57.927 --> 01:01.061
Because if I don't, I'm afraid
of who I might become.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.644
Ooh.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.429
Aren't you looking all dapper,
Aunt Vi?

02:05.603 --> 02:08.171
Spending the day with
Tricia in Connecticut.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.348
Ah.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.046
And how's that going?

02:14.221 --> 02:16.310
We're not asking
any questions right now.

02:16.484 --> 02:19.051
Just simply enjoying
each other's company.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.531
Well, you think
you could drop Dee off

02:20.662 --> 02:22.185
on your way to your rendezvous?

02:22.359 --> 02:24.753
Of course.Mom?

02:24.883 --> 02:26.972
Do you know about this?

02:27.103 --> 02:29.323
Yeah. He's gonna be fine.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.368
You're not the one
who shot him, are you?

02:32.456 --> 02:33.849
No.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.851
Just glad
he's gonna be okay.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.983
He was so kind to Dee
when Jason was shot.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.812
Well, he's at home recovering.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.727
Wait.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.120
Are you guys friends now?

02:44.251 --> 02:46.514
Aren't you gonna
be late for school?

02:49.038 --> 02:50.779
Aunt Vi's gonna drop you off.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.043
That is not an answer.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.827
Maybe it was.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.221
Come on, girl.
Let's go.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.924
Vanessa.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.883
I thought you'd be
back at work by now.

03:08.057 --> 03:11.539
I am. I'm just pitching in with
the kids while Marcus recovers.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.889
He's in the middle of
a physical therapy session.

03:14.063 --> 03:14.890
He's gonna be a while.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.674
Oh. How y'all doing?

03:16.848 --> 03:19.851
Kyler and Stefon don't want
to let him out of their sight.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.679
We're all appreciating

03:21.853 --> 03:23.855
he's still with us
and that you brought him home.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.901
Well, we got lucky.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.033
I have a feeling
luck has nothing to do with it

03:28.208 --> 03:29.600
where you're concerned.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.559
How's he doing?

03:32.951 --> 03:34.518
Shoulder and knee are healing.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.520
But he won't talk
about the rest--

03:36.694 --> 03:38.479
turning in his badge.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.524
Seems more worried
about how all this

03:40.698 --> 03:42.526
is affecting the kids
than himself.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.486
I get it.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.183
But in times of stress,

03:47.314 --> 03:49.054
it's like being on a plane.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.318
When the oxygen masks drop,

03:51.492 --> 03:53.624
parents have to be the one
to put it on first.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.452
I told him pretty much
the same thing.

03:55.626 --> 03:56.627
Great minds.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.633
I gotta take this call.Yeah.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.678
I'll-I'll let him know
you stopped by.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.462
Thank you.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.855
Hello?

04:06.985 --> 04:08.726
- This is red flag.
- 6343.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.337
Open source.
Requesting ghost render.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.208
songbird, Alpha-Theta, six.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.781
So, I just got
an interesting voice mail.

04:19.955 --> 04:22.653
Yeah? From who?From your old buddy
Paulie Schinzel.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.655
Mm. What'd he want?

04:24.786 --> 04:27.179
To tell me that
he's completely freaked out,

04:27.354 --> 04:29.007
because he was walking
around the East Side

04:29.181 --> 04:30.879
and he thought
he saw a ghost.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.794
You. He said he
tried to catch up,

04:32.968 --> 04:34.491
but you vanished
behind a bus.

04:34.665 --> 04:35.623
And now he thinks
he's losing his mind.

04:35.797 --> 04:36.841
Good.
Honey...

04:37.015 --> 04:38.190
What? I mean...

04:38.365 --> 04:39.366
that guy's entire thing was

04:39.540 --> 04:41.585
how important
a friend I was to him.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.413
Meanwhile, he doesn't even
go to my own funeral.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.546
You're still holding
that against him?
Yeah.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.243
There are plenty
of reasons why

04:47.374 --> 04:48.592
people don't go
to funerals.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.028
Yeah, but it was
a perfect metaphor

04:50.202 --> 04:51.682
for our entire
relationship.

04:51.856 --> 04:52.683
You know, the only time
I ever heard from that guy

04:52.814 --> 04:54.250
was when he wanted
something from me.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.947
You know, a favor,
advice, a shoulder to cry on.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.514
I was always there for him.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.821
The one time I die?
Dude couldn't be bothered.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.823
You need to let this go.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.303
Oh. Hey, Rob.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.479
What's up?I just got a strange call.

05:05.609 --> 05:06.610
Schinzel?

05:06.784 --> 05:07.829
Who?

05:08.003 --> 05:09.961
Ignore that.
What was the call?

05:10.135 --> 05:11.485
An SOS call from a CIA agent

05:11.615 --> 05:13.791
asking to meet
at specific coordinates.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.140
Why is a CIA agent calling you?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.751
I have no clue.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.535
I haven't seen or spoken
to her in ten years.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.581
Do me a favor, dig into her.

05:20.755 --> 05:21.930
Her name is Marcela Mendez.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.279
See what you can find out

05:23.410 --> 05:24.585
about what she's been up
to lately.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.413
Mendez. All right.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.764
Any idea what
she was calling about?No.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.027
But a red flag code...

05:32.201 --> 05:34.769
You don't send one of those up
unless it's life or death.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.811
You move, you die.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.649
Hands up,
nice and easy.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.739
Wait!

06:31.913 --> 06:33.697
You're...

06:33.871 --> 06:35.656
Robyn McCall.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.837
I suppose that makes losing
my gun a bit less embarrassing.

06:43.011 --> 06:43.925
Who are you?

06:44.055 --> 06:47.102
Carter Griffin. CIA.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.670
I worked support roles
on a few of your missions.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.236
Do you mind?Not until you tell me

06:51.411 --> 06:53.021
what I just walked into.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.805
I wish I could. I got here
a minute before you.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.328
I'm Marcela's handler.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
She missed her check-in,
so I came to find her.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.508
In case you're thinking
this was me,

07:01.682 --> 07:03.510
the shot came through there
from a distance.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.909
Your turn.
Why are you here?

07:12.083 --> 07:13.694
Thought you were out.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.173
I am.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.740
Marcela called me.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.089
With a red flag code.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.788
She called you?

07:20.962 --> 07:23.399
If she was in trouble,
why didn't she call me?

07:23.530 --> 07:24.748
Good question.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.054
Was she on-mission?

07:26.228 --> 07:27.751
No, just came off.

07:27.925 --> 07:28.883
What was it?

07:29.057 --> 07:30.232
Defection.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.760
Three weeks ago,
a Chinese translator at the U.N.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.110
named Chen Ying reached out.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.677
Wanted to trade
sensitive information

07:40.851 --> 07:42.636
in exchange for
U.S. protection.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.334
But last week, before
Marcela could bring her in,

07:45.508 --> 07:47.989
the translator was pulled
back to China.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.426
Days later, she was found
in Beijing with her throat slit.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.559
Beijing is sending a message.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.910
Thanks.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.089
I'm confused.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.482
How did you
know Marcela?

08:04.962 --> 08:06.311
She was my student.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.138
Come on, what do you have?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.662
What do you have?

08:08.792 --> 08:10.751
Breathe it. Breathe it.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.102
Parry, parry, parry.

08:14.232 --> 08:15.886
Drop. Let's go.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.547
Release!

08:27.942 --> 08:29.378
That's three
submissions in a row.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.771
He's bigger, stronger.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.555
"There are no limits."

08:33.600 --> 08:35.253
Bruce Lee.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.603
He was your height,

08:36.777 --> 08:38.822
not much heavier than you,
but he could deliver

08:38.996 --> 08:42.565
a punching power
of 350 pounds. Why?

08:42.696 --> 08:45.089
Because he spent
hundreds of hours

08:45.263 --> 08:47.004
with singular purpose

08:47.178 --> 08:49.833
until he perfected
his technique.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.488
The reason you keep
losing on the mat is you.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.317
You're sloppy.
You're unfocused.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.538
You're not working hard enough.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.976
Come on, girl.

09:02.150 --> 09:02.977
Again!

09:05.588 --> 09:07.372
Single shot to the T-box.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.374
Bullet severed
her spinal column.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.247
At least she didn't suffer.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.641
Which means whoever did it
was a pro.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.883
Better.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.625
Better? That's it?

09:42.756 --> 09:44.235
What, you want a trophy
for staying alive?

09:44.409 --> 09:46.803
Don't.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.892
Oh, they're going to hell
anyways. I should just

09:49.066 --> 09:50.328
chop them off.They can be useful.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.852
I once hid
a nano-chip

09:52.026 --> 09:53.201
under my nail at a war zone

09:53.375 --> 09:55.290
border crossing in Rwanda.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.598
It's the one place
men never think to check.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.563
Given her temperature, I put
time of death less than an hour.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.044
Her clothes, hair...

10:10.218 --> 10:11.698
smell odd.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.917
Like rotten eggs.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.397
Any idea why?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.486
No.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.231
What can you tell me
about the translator, Chen?

10:23.361 --> 10:24.928
All due respect,

10:25.102 --> 10:26.713
this is Agency business.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.149
You're not Agency.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.672
She called me for a reason.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.718
One you won't--
or can't-- explain.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.067
Playing it like that?

10:33.241 --> 10:34.242
You know how it is.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.026
If you're not in, then you're--

10:36.157 --> 10:37.898
Out.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.204
That is, until
they need something from you.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.294
Well, I guess
I'll leave you to it.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.867
Wow. Microdot.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.652
So cool.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.263
This was the tech du jour

10:55.393 --> 10:56.743
in World War One and Two.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.483
And then it just
kind of vanished.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.224
Can you read it?Yeah, I should be able to.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.617
It's really nothing more

11:01.791 --> 11:02.879
than a severely reduced image.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.359
I guess in today's world of

11:04.533 --> 11:05.621
"anything electronic
can be hacked,"

11:05.752 --> 11:07.710
old-school is
making a comeback.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.843
Look at that.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.281
That's a bank transfer.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.848
Can you run it down?

11:14.978 --> 11:15.979
Yeah.You didn't tell Griffin

11:16.153 --> 11:17.720
you took it, did you?

11:17.851 --> 11:18.895
If Marcela didn't trust the CIA
on this one,

11:19.069 --> 11:20.070
why should I?

11:20.201 --> 11:21.506
Looks like
the transaction was

11:21.681 --> 11:23.117
a very large deposit

11:23.291 --> 11:24.379
into an account
for a shell corporation

11:24.553 --> 11:26.163
from an untraceable
outside source.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.208
How large?

11:27.338 --> 11:29.340
$100 million.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.603
Can you trace the shell corp
that received it?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.214
Yeah, it gets a little fuzzy,
but it looks like

11:33.344 --> 11:34.476
the most direct line

11:34.650 --> 11:35.303
is a guy named
Daniel Blake.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.957
You know him?

11:37.131 --> 11:37.871
Yeah, Blake was a new
player on the scene

11:38.001 --> 11:39.611
as I was getting out.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.744
Says here he was
an English businessman

11:41.875 --> 11:44.225
who made his fortune in oil
and other global interests.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.966
He's also rumored to be
the Silk Road

11:46.140 --> 11:47.532
of black-market traffickers.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.143
He can get you
anything you need...

11:49.317 --> 11:51.058
for top dollar.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.886
Well, somebody's paying him
a lot for something.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.584
And whatever it was
just got Marcela killed.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.326
That still doesn't explain
why she called me.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.327
Huh.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.111
Huh, what?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.547
Ten minutes after
that payment came in,

12:02.678 --> 12:03.374
funds from the same account
were used

12:03.548 --> 12:04.767
to charter
a private jet

12:04.941 --> 12:06.377
from Australia
to New York.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.596
It's due to arrive
in just over an hour.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.554
Blake coming to town?No.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.035
According to the web,
he's already in town.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.429
Page Six has him at
a charity event last night.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.952
Well, if it's not Blake,

12:16.126 --> 12:17.780
it's someone he's
in business with.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.130
Maybe someone connected
to that transfer.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.045
Yeah, and if Marcela was
tracing that account,

12:22.219 --> 12:23.612
it'll be someone significant.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.048
We need to be there

12:25.222 --> 12:26.833
when that plane lands.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.704
You two up for
some surveillance?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.227
Always.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.708
In the meantime,
you find anything

12:32.882 --> 12:34.144
on that translator Marcela
was trying to bring in?

12:34.318 --> 12:35.842
Chen Ying?

12:36.016 --> 12:37.539
Yeah, to say her
social media presence

12:37.713 --> 12:39.193
is "minimal"
would be generous.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.022
I found three photos.
That's everything.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.675
You know, you gotta figure

12:43.850 --> 12:45.460
the Chinese government
controlled her posts.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.854
Who's the woman
in the picture with her?

12:48.028 --> 12:49.464
Another translator.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.378
She seems like a friend.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.075
What you thinking?

12:52.249 --> 12:54.861
I'm thinking if Chen had
information to trade

12:55.035 --> 12:58.081
and she thought
the government was onto it,

12:58.255 --> 12:59.996
then maybe she was smart
enough to hide it.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.433
So while you two get eyes
on that plane,

13:02.607 --> 13:03.608
I'm gonna hit up the friend.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.088
See if she can
provide some insight

13:05.262 --> 13:06.655
into Chen's movements.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.092
Especially on the day
she was grabbed.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.530
I got a feeling

13:12.704 --> 13:15.011
she knew she was gonna die.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.238
Nope. Not our plane.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.544
Hey, babe,
while we're waiting...

13:28.285 --> 13:29.809
Hey, Mel. It's Paulie again.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.288
I just wanted to apologizeUgh.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.855
for calling you
in the first place.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.118
It was insensitive of me
to bring up Harry.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.512
Truth is, I...
I don't know what I saw.

13:37.686 --> 13:38.687
Guess I still feel
a lot of guilt

13:38.861 --> 13:40.863
for not going to the funeral.Yeah.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.212
Listen, I want you to know

13:42.343 --> 13:43.997
I actually did go
to that church,

13:44.127 --> 13:46.608
but I just...
I-I couldn't go in.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.566
Anyway, I...

13:48.740 --> 13:50.438
Sorry. Again.Come on.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.832
Hope you're doing well.
Okay, bye.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.659
What am I supposed
to do with that?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.487
People change, Harry.Mm.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.794
Relationships change.Mm-hmm.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.404
Maybe it's worth giving
him another shot.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.975
Hold that thought. We're on.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.809
Bom dia.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.332
Good morning.
How are you?

14:15.506 --> 14:16.638
Fine, thanks.
Credentials, please.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.727
Yes, of course.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.642
I'm with
the Brazilian delegation.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.827
Have a good day.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.612
Thank you.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.717
Who is that?

14:52.848 --> 14:54.676
I don't know.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.022
Excuse me.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.328
I was wondering
if you could help me.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.983
I was supposed to meet
Chen Ying for lunch.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.593
Did she move offices?

15:42.767 --> 15:44.552
Oh, I'm afraid she left
back for China.

15:44.726 --> 15:45.683
She left last week.

15:45.814 --> 15:46.989
That explains it.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.773
Her phone is not in service,

15:48.904 --> 15:50.036
she's not answering any emails.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.255
Does she have any family here?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.344
I have some books
I would love to return to her.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.433
Oh, I don't think so.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.348
Well, do you know
where she was staying?

15:58.479 --> 16:00.307
Maybe they left
a forwarding address.

16:00.481 --> 16:03.005
Sorry, we never really
saw each other outside of work.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.794
What a lovely bracelet.Thanks.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.274
Chen had one just like it.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
This is hers.
She gave it to me

16:13.146 --> 16:14.147
as a gift
the day she left, so...

16:15.626 --> 16:17.846
That is so Chen, right?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.327
Well, thank you for your time.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.938
Marcia Silva.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.853
Fen Zhang. Nice to meet you.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.699
Chen must have known
they were coming for her.

16:44.873 --> 16:48.311
Smart move.
Desperate, but smart.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.401
What is it?

16:51.532 --> 16:53.186
Huh.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.710
It's a transcript
of a phone conversation.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.494
Anything in there
worth killing for?

16:57.668 --> 16:58.974
First guy's name is Jin Meng.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.889
He's one of China's
Vice Premiers.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.325
He was at the
U.N. last month

17:02.499 --> 17:04.023
as part of their
diplomatic mission.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.242
Chen must've
transcribed the call.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.288
Well, who's he
talking to?

17:08.462 --> 17:09.898
The other speaker
is unidentified.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.639
They keep talking
about someone named Liu.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.510
Who is Liu?
Is there a last name?No.

17:13.684 --> 17:14.816
They're both very worried

17:14.990 --> 17:16.426
that she's
disappeared.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.472
It's a matter of
national security.

17:18.646 --> 17:19.734
Harry, there's
a time stamp

17:19.908 --> 17:20.778
on this transcription.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.258
Is there any way
to find out

17:22.432 --> 17:23.955
who the Vice Premier
is talking to?

17:24.130 --> 17:26.567
I mean, the call most likely
came from within China.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.656
But hacking their phone system
will be difficult.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.049
But can you do it?

17:30.223 --> 17:32.355
I mean, I can try.
It'll take some time.

17:32.529 --> 17:33.922
How'd the surveillance go?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.793
Well, we made it
before the plane landed.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.795
Only one passenger got off.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.233
He got into Blake's limo,
but we lost them in traffic.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.799
We got pictures, though.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.630
No.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.545
It can't be.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.330
What? You know him?

17:50.504 --> 17:51.940
Yeah, I know him.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.376
He's the one
I told you about.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.813
The one who tried to kill me.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.512
The murdering bastard
the CIA let go.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.950
That's Mason Quinn.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.614
Mason Quinn? The guy
who sent those mercs

18:13.788 --> 18:14.963
after Henson's daughter
last year?Yes.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.183
This man's a sociopath.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.532
He has no country,
no allegiance

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
or conscience.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.970
Assassinations, kidnappings,

18:22.144 --> 18:23.928
overthrowing governments.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.017
He'll do anything for a price.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.758
And after years of chasing him
down and grabbing him,

18:27.932 --> 18:30.109
the CIA just trades him away
in some shady backroom deal?

18:30.283 --> 18:31.458
No wonder
Marcela went to you

18:31.632 --> 18:33.590
and not them.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.289
But-- Okay.
What is Quinn doing in New York?

18:36.463 --> 18:39.422
Well, he just paid Daniel Blake
a fortune for something.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.728
We need
to find out what.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.295
But the guy's a ghost.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.905
He's deep underground by now.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.124
Then how do we find him?

18:46.560 --> 18:47.256
What?

18:49.302 --> 18:52.392
Bishop gave me a file
full of intel on Quinn.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.785
But he warned me
never to look at it.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.439
He knew if I opened it,

18:56.613 --> 18:57.962
I wouldn't be able
to help myself,

18:58.093 --> 18:59.399
I would be right back in.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.444
Well, you said yourself

19:01.618 --> 19:03.316
your obsession with Quinn
almost got you killed.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.579
And it saved countless lives.

19:05.753 --> 19:06.841
If Quinn is involved,

19:07.015 --> 19:08.625
something big
is going down.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.193
Rob, something big is always
gonna be going down.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.542
Maybe... maybe Bishop is right

19:12.716 --> 19:13.804
and the safe play

19:13.978 --> 19:15.023
is just to sit this one out.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.421
If Quinn is operating
in this city...

19:21.595 --> 19:23.945
no one is safe.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.170
I've been through it
backwards and forwards.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.085
It's like a big
jigsaw puzzle.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.522
I mean, there's intel

20:19.696 --> 20:21.916
from nearly every intelligence
agency in the world.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.266
Mossad, MI6, Russian FSB.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.181
Quinn clearly
has no qualms

20:26.312 --> 20:27.922
about going after
people's families.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.706
Yeah,
and the name "Willow" comes up

20:29.837 --> 20:31.926
multiple times in
intercepted chatter from Quinn.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.145
"CIA hasn't cracked
Black Window.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.886
"Possible to abduct Willow?

20:36.060 --> 20:38.019
For this to work,
I need her."

20:39.412 --> 20:41.196
In Chinese, "willow" is "Liu."

20:42.502 --> 20:43.851
That's who they were talking
about in the transcript.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.635
So a kidnap victim?
A spouse?

20:45.809 --> 20:46.854
A kid?

20:47.028 --> 20:48.943
I don't know.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.249
"CIA hasn't cracked
Black Window."

20:50.423 --> 20:51.685
What the hell is Black Window?

20:51.859 --> 20:53.339
Can you ask Bishop?

20:53.513 --> 20:54.731
Bishop is radio silent
on a job in Europe.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.255
Can't get to him.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.082
And even if I could,
he won't help me.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.997
Not if it involves Mason Quinn.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.958
I need to go to Griffin.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.482
Wait. The guy works for
the same agency

21:06.656 --> 21:08.092
that let Quinn go
in the first place.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.920
I didn't say I trusted him.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.357
Doesn't mean he can't help.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.228
How do we know
he won't set you up?

21:13.402 --> 21:15.665
If he does, I'll handle it.Oh, Rob...

21:15.839 --> 21:17.798
It's a risk I'm gonna
have to take.
I mean, is it?
Let's just wait a beat.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.582
We don't have a beat.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.762
She's going to the CIA.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.503
She's not thinking straight.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.331
She's making
it personal.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.115
Yeah. I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.472
Thanks for coming.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.910
Tell anybody
you were meeting me?

21:43.084 --> 21:45.695
I like my job too much.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.741
What'd you find?

21:47.915 --> 21:49.656
Pieces to a puzzle,

21:49.830 --> 21:51.832
but I need something from you
to put them together.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.355
What are the pieces?

21:55.531 --> 21:58.142
You're not gonna tell me?

21:58.273 --> 22:00.493
There's a reason
Marcela came to me.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.408
'Cause she didn't know
who to trust.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.279
Frankly, neither do I.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.803
And yet I'm supposed
to trust you?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.414
I'm not asking for your trust.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.067
Asking for your help.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.852
The reason
I left the CIA is

22:12.026 --> 22:13.897
because I lost faith
in the institution,

22:14.071 --> 22:16.073
but not the mission.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.032
The way I see it,

22:18.206 --> 22:19.729
if you want to know the truth
about what happened,

22:19.860 --> 22:22.166
then you'll help me.

22:22.297 --> 22:25.082
But if you're involved,
you won't.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.088
What would you want me to do?

22:31.219 --> 22:33.656
Get into the Agency system.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.223
Find out everything
you can about an operation

22:35.397 --> 22:37.443
called "Black Window"...

22:37.617 --> 22:39.314
without ringing any bells.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.881
Why does it have
to be back-channel?

22:42.752 --> 22:44.537
Because the players involved
may have connections

22:44.667 --> 22:45.929
at the front office.

22:48.192 --> 22:49.759
You know what you're asking?

22:49.890 --> 22:51.979
The personal,
professional, and legal

22:52.109 --> 22:55.112
ramifications if I'm caught?

22:55.286 --> 22:58.507
For someone I don't trust
who doesn't trust me?

23:00.204 --> 23:02.511
You just described
intelligence work.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.563
How'd it go?

23:10.737 --> 23:12.086
Therapist said
I won't be able to drive

23:12.260 --> 23:13.217
for at least
a couple more weeks.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.697
I'm sorry, Nessa.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.438
The least I can do
is get the kids

23:16.612 --> 23:18.440
and run a few errands
while you recover.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.007
Anything you need
while I'm out?

23:20.137 --> 23:21.400
Not unless you can find me
a new shoulder.

23:23.706 --> 23:24.707
It's this
I'm more worried about.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.363
You want to talk about it?

23:28.494 --> 23:30.234
Nope.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.718
By the way, your friend came by.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.851
Thought I heard her voice.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.723
She cares about you,

23:40.897 --> 23:42.812
and based on that flicker
of a smile I just saw,

23:42.943 --> 23:43.857
the feeling is mutual.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.382
I've known you for
a really long time, Marcus.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.384
If you don't want to talk to me,

23:49.515 --> 23:51.517
maybe you should talk to her.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.220
Okay. Griffin's in.

23:59.394 --> 24:00.961
Any luck on
that transcript?

24:01.135 --> 24:02.876
I traced the incoming call
to the Vice Premier,

24:03.050 --> 24:06.009
and the man on the other end
of the phone was Timofey Popov.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.533
Never heard of him.

24:07.707 --> 24:08.751
He's a Russian scientist.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.187
The Chinese often
throw big money

24:10.361 --> 24:11.624
at foreign specialists
to siphon expertise.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.846
Hey.Hey.

24:17.020 --> 24:20.067
I was able to get in
and pull files on Black Window.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.851
You okay?

24:21.982 --> 24:23.070
Yeah.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.898
Yeah, I, um,

24:25.072 --> 24:26.203
I think I covered my tracks.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.031
What'd you find out?

24:30.164 --> 24:33.950
All right. Black Window refers
to an Agency investigation

24:34.124 --> 24:36.605
into Air Penang Flight 127

24:36.779 --> 24:39.913
that went down under
mysterious circumstances

24:40.087 --> 24:41.436
seven months ago.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.307
Flight just suddenly
lost power.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.222
Dropped from the sky
like a stone.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.703
And when they recovered
the black box,

24:47.877 --> 24:49.226
it was completely wiped.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.706
Any idea how?

24:50.880 --> 24:51.968
No. The investigation
started to stall,

24:52.142 --> 24:53.753
so they recently

24:53.883 --> 24:56.233
recruited your old mentor,
William Bishop, to help.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.844
Bishop?

24:59.367 --> 25:01.369
So that's what he's been up to
the past two months.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.154
Sorry, that's, uh,
that's all I got.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.678
Well, that's plenty.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.288
I'll read you in when I can.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.428
The Russian.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.647
What kind of scientist is he?

25:18.821 --> 25:21.781
Uh...

25:21.955 --> 25:24.305
He specializes in
directed magnetic fields.

25:24.479 --> 25:27.264
Directed magnetic fields.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.050
Planes going down.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.574
Willow is not a person.
It's a weapon.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.271
Targeted EMP that can

25:34.445 --> 25:35.490
knock any aircraft
out of the sky.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.361
And no one would know who did it

25:37.536 --> 25:38.841
or even how.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.930
It would be
completely untraceable.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.454
And one of the most dangerous
men on the planet

25:43.629 --> 25:44.891
is about to get
his hands on it.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.337
Tried Bishop,
still no answer.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.817
What do you know
about EMPs?

25:57.991 --> 25:59.862
Pretty much every country
in the world

26:00.036 --> 26:01.516
is trying to develop
one that works long-range.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.126
Well, it looks like
China succeeded.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.519
Yeah, and Blake stole it.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.260
This must've been the info

26:06.434 --> 26:07.522
Chen was going to trade
for her defection.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.784
I mean,
no person or government

26:08.958 --> 26:10.307
should have this much power.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.832
Flight 127 must have been
proof of concept.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.485
Yeah. Quinn saw
the obvious benefits,

26:14.660 --> 26:16.531
wanted in
and hired Blake to get it.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.489
But if Quinn is here
to take possession,

26:18.664 --> 26:19.795
then Blake must've
shipped it here.

26:19.969 --> 26:20.840
I'm way ahead of you.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.406
I'm into Blake's oil company.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.320
Based on the transcript, right,

26:23.451 --> 26:24.887
we know the approximate time

26:25.061 --> 26:26.541
that Willow was stolen.
Check this out.

26:26.715 --> 26:27.411
There was a shipment
of drilling equipment

26:27.586 --> 26:28.804
that went from China to Blake,

26:28.978 --> 26:29.979
all of which
was sent to Texas,

26:30.110 --> 26:31.807
except for this one group here,

26:31.981 --> 26:34.027
which was sent
to a warehouse in the Bronx.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.551
I'm gonna check that out.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.074
H-Hold on a second.
Shouldn't we be

26:38.248 --> 26:39.554
screaming about all this
from the rooftops?

26:39.685 --> 26:40.816
He's right.
Maybe it's time

26:40.990 --> 26:42.775
to turn it over to the CIA.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.646
I mean, they have the resources,
let them do their jobs.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.779
Like last time?
When they let Quinn go?

26:46.909 --> 26:48.345
I mean, God knows
what they're into

26:48.519 --> 26:49.999
with Quinn now or how deep.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.348
Fine. I'm going with you.I am, too.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.481
No.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.570
The last time you got involved
with the Agency,

26:55.744 --> 26:56.919
you wound up
in an interrogation room

26:57.093 --> 26:59.226
and you were in a jail cell.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.793
People that tangle
with Quinn end up dead.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.708
I'm not doing
that to you.

27:02.882 --> 27:05.449
You can still help me from here.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.800
Rob, somebody needs
to watch your back.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.803
Fine, what about Griffin?

27:10.933 --> 27:12.369
Can you trust him?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.861
I appreciate you
pulling me in.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.647
Well, one leap of faith
deserves another.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.518
You deserve to help take down

27:30.692 --> 27:32.912
that bastard
that killed Marcela.

27:41.572 --> 27:45.098
All right. We're looking
for Bin 6E-326.

27:56.892 --> 27:59.025
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. McCall.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.418
Empty.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.118
Too late.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.076
Both of you...

28:07.207 --> 28:09.557
...turn around slowly.

28:11.864 --> 28:12.908
Turn the hell around.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.221
Where's the EMP?

28:21.395 --> 28:22.744
I don't know.

28:23.789 --> 28:24.920
Wrong answer.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.750
Where's the weapon
that was in that crate?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.883
Okay. All right.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.798
He's demonstrating it
to a buyer at00 p.m.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.103
On what?I don't know.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.757
Where?

28:37.019 --> 28:38.107
Where?I don't know!

28:38.281 --> 28:39.630
I swear.

28:39.805 --> 28:40.980
You got bracelets
for our friends?

28:48.161 --> 28:49.249
You all hearing me?

28:49.423 --> 28:50.380
You're not gonna tell me

28:50.554 --> 28:51.338
who you're talking to,
are you?

28:53.253 --> 28:54.341
We're not there yet.

28:54.515 --> 28:55.690
Yep. Yeah, we're here.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.126
The EMP is gone.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.258
Blake's planning
on demonstrating

28:58.432 --> 28:59.563
the weapon for Quinn

28:59.694 --> 29:01.130
to seal the deal in 30 minutes.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.002
Another plane?

29:03.176 --> 29:04.873
Stands to reason.

29:05.047 --> 29:07.006
There are 3,000 flights coming
into New York every day.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.399
Harry, we need that big brain
of yours to improve those odds.

29:09.573 --> 29:10.705
Any ideas?

29:10.836 --> 29:12.968
Okay, wait a minute.
Um... Yeah.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.883
An EMP would
require at least

29:15.057 --> 29:17.364
a half a million watts
of power to fire.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.888
What does Blake own near an
airport with that kind of juice?

29:20.062 --> 29:22.064
I've got two facilities
that fit the bill.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.545
One is by JFK, the other is by
Long Island McArthur Airport.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.286
We don't have time to hit both.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.679
What kind of facilities?Bulk storage structure....

29:28.854 --> 29:30.812
and a refinery.The refinery.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.466
How do you know?

29:32.640 --> 29:33.946
Marcela was onto Blake
when she was killed.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.077
When I found her body,

29:35.251 --> 29:36.600
her hair and her clothes

29:36.731 --> 29:38.254
smelled like rotten eggs.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.821
Meaning...

29:39.952 --> 29:41.040
It's what hydrogen sulfide
smells like.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.694
Which is used
in oil refineries.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.958
I'll scramble a team, but we
have to go through the FBI.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.655
It's gonna take time
to get them on location.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.091
What about air traffic control?

29:49.265 --> 29:50.832
Can they divert the plane?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.486
There's 50, 60 planes landing
in the next hour.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.922
There's no way
to divert them all.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.184
We need to know
which one he's targeting.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.099
Knowing Quinn, his MO...

29:57.273 --> 29:58.971
the target won't be random.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.060
He will have chosen it
for a reason.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.496
Rob, I've got the blue prints
for the refinery.

30:02.670 --> 30:03.889
Where am I going?

30:04.063 --> 30:06.108
The main electrical
substation is at

30:06.282 --> 30:07.501
the far northeast end.
That's where he'd plug in.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.981
Well, can you shut it down?

30:09.155 --> 30:10.417
Not without knocking out
half the city.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.853
Not to mention,
it would take a couple of hours.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.246
That's too long.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.552
We could go over
Bishop's file again,

30:15.726 --> 30:17.903
cross-reference every known
person of interest to Quinn

30:18.077 --> 30:19.774
with flights landing
in the next 20 minutes.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.167
That's thousands of people.
We don't have the time.

30:21.341 --> 30:22.603
Try anyway.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.433
I know what you're thinking.

30:26.563 --> 30:27.521
She can't do this alone.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.305
She doesn't want us involved.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.698
She's gonna get herself killed.
It's Mason Quinn.

30:35.442 --> 30:36.399
I'll hit the file.

30:36.573 --> 30:37.923
You go.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.496
Target's ten minutes out.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.325
Copy.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.327
FBI just authorized
a response team.

30:51.501 --> 30:52.285
ETA 30 minutes.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.113
That's too late.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.506
Any luck?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.247
I searched all known
persons of interest

30:58.378 --> 31:00.206
to Quinn and cross-referenced
it with the passenger list

31:00.380 --> 31:01.903
of every flight
coming in the next half hour.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.600
And?

31:03.774 --> 31:04.906
There's a private jet
coming in from Europe.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.690
Rob, it's registered
to Bishop Security.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.431
I checked the manifest.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.043
Bishop's on that flight.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.395
When does it land?

31:15.569 --> 31:17.571
15 minutes.
It's over the airspace in eight.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.573
Bishop must have connected
some dots.

31:19.747 --> 31:20.835
Quinn's gonna use
that weapons test

31:20.966 --> 31:22.358
to take him out.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.273
You have to warn the pilot.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.536
Divert the plane.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.713
Rob, if I hack into air traffic
control, I'll be exposed.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.193
The CIA could track it.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.107
Harry!

31:34.327 --> 31:35.415
I'll try.

31:50.952 --> 31:54.825
Flight T7 23P, T7 23P.
Please respond.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.653
This is
Tango-seven-two-three-Papa.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.307
Who is this? Ground control?

31:58.438 --> 32:00.396
No, this is an anonymous

32:00.570 --> 32:02.181
but very concerned citizen.

32:02.355 --> 32:04.139
You need to divert immediately.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.749
Your plane is being targeted.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.664
Who is that?

32:07.838 --> 32:09.449
Whoever's broadcasting,
please clear this frequency.

32:09.623 --> 32:10.972
It is a federal offense...No, no. Just... listen, please.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.539
There's no time to explain,

32:12.669 --> 32:14.062
but your aircraft is about
to be shot down.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.369
You need
to reverse course immediately.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.806
ATC, do you know what this
joker is talking about?

32:18.980 --> 32:21.461
Negative,
Tango-seven-two-three-Papa.

32:21.635 --> 32:22.723
That is not us. You are clear.

32:22.897 --> 32:24.420
No, you are not clear!

32:24.594 --> 32:26.118
Look, I don't know
what you're up to, fella,

32:26.248 --> 32:27.989
but you just committed
a federal offense,

32:28.163 --> 32:29.469
so I'd find yourself
a good lawyer.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.906
Just-- No. Damn it!

32:38.478 --> 32:39.696
Harry,

32:39.870 --> 32:41.133
any luck diverting that plane?

32:41.263 --> 32:43.091
I've been trying.
They're not listening to me.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.443
We're gonna have
to do this ourselves.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.968
A direct assault
would be suicide.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.149
I'm gonna have to cut the power.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.933
Wait here.

33:11.598 --> 33:12.991
Okay, I got a plan...

33:26.787 --> 33:28.223
I keep hearing
you retired,

33:28.397 --> 33:30.095
but you keep on
showing up.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.401
Someone's got to stop you.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.229
But not you.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.970
Or your mentor up there.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.191
This thing you
have, this...

33:39.321 --> 33:41.845
moral center.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.760
You think it's
a source of strength,

33:43.891 --> 33:45.632
but it's not.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.112
It's an anchor.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.679
Which is why

33:49.853 --> 33:52.291
I will always win.

33:53.988 --> 33:58.645
Two minutes. It is,
as they say, showtime.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.777
Let's see if this thing works.

34:03.563 --> 34:04.868
Damn it, listen to me.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.044
I know you're Bishop Security.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.871
I know William Bishop is
on board.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.526
Now tell him the request
to divert is coming from McCall.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.528
Tell him Quinn is targeting
the plane.

34:12.702 --> 34:13.573
I told you to get...

34:13.747 --> 34:15.227
No! Tell him right now

34:15.401 --> 34:17.272
or you and everyone
on that plane is dead!

34:17.446 --> 34:19.274
Stand by.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.844
30 seconds out.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.500
Engaging
targeting system.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.257
Readyto fire.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.347
I spoke to Bishop.

34:48.477 --> 34:49.870
Tango-seven-two-three-Papa
declaring emergency

34:50.044 --> 34:51.306
and diverting.Yes!

34:51.480 --> 34:53.613
Repeat,
Tango-seven-two-three-Papa

34:53.787 --> 34:55.093
declaring emergency
and diverting.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.138
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.184
There.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.412
ATC, flight controls
unrespons...

35:12.632 --> 35:12.980
Tango-seven-two-three-Papa

35:13.154 --> 35:14.068
out of flight level.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.635
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

35:17.985 --> 35:20.640
Two-three-Papa, we show you
heading 330 at zero...

35:20.814 --> 35:22.424
Recover, recover!

35:22.598 --> 35:23.382
He's heading towards the ocean.

35:43.619 --> 35:45.752
Bishop...

35:48.798 --> 35:50.757
I'd call that a success.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.110
Transfer payment.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.591
What about them?

36:02.247 --> 36:03.987
Kill them.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.501
Quinn?That way, toward the back.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.171
No. Rob, no!

36:57.345 --> 36:59.129
Rob, if you take
that chopper down,

36:59.304 --> 37:01.828
the trajectory puts it right
in the heart of Queens. Rob,

37:01.958 --> 37:03.264
I know you want
Quinn dead,

37:03.395 --> 37:04.222
but think of
the collateral damage.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.311
Think of the
casualties!

37:07.616 --> 37:09.662
Don't.

37:43.478 --> 37:46.089
Quinn's helicopter disappeared
from radar.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.701
And the authorities haven't
been able to locate it.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.007
He got away.

37:53.183 --> 37:55.403
He got away and Bishop is gone.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.885
I'm so sorry, Rob.

37:59.015 --> 38:01.191
It's all my fault.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.889
No, what are you talking about?

38:03.019 --> 38:05.326
Bishop only agreed
to help the CIA

38:05.457 --> 38:07.676
because he wanted
to bring in Quinn. For me.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.897
Well, at least you stopped
Quinn from getting his prize.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.028
It doesn't matter.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.116
Whatever he's
planning,

38:13.291 --> 38:14.466
he'll find another
way to do it.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.904
But thanks for your help.

38:19.732 --> 38:22.256
And thanks for
not listening to me.

38:23.562 --> 38:25.738
I just wish I could have
gotten there sooner.

38:25.912 --> 38:27.392
Me, too.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.132
To Bishop.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.400
It wasn't your fault.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.489
No.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.927
It was Quinn's.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.424
Uh, babe,

38:59.598 --> 39:01.556
Paulie Schinzel
just walked in.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.167
Yeah. No, I-I invited him.

39:04.298 --> 39:05.952
What?After what happened to Bishop,

39:06.082 --> 39:08.084
I figured life's too short
to carry grudges.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.086
Best to cherish
what we got.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.567
No matter how imperfect.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.744
Harry.Hey, buddy.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.529
I'm so glad you're alive!

39:17.659 --> 39:18.791
Whoa, man!

39:18.965 --> 39:19.792
Oh, my God.That's a lot.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.316
Oh!

39:37.897 --> 39:40.726
Bishop? Bish?

39:40.900 --> 39:42.902
This is the second time
you've gotten in my way.

39:43.076 --> 39:44.599
Don't come for me again,

39:44.773 --> 39:46.471
because then I'll have
to come after you.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.179
Everything okay?

40:01.224 --> 40:04.358
No.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.100
I lost a really
good friend today.

40:10.233 --> 40:13.236
And, uh, I could use someone
to talk to about it.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.459
You're not alone in that.

40:21.593 --> 40:23.508
I'll make some coffee.

40:42.091 --> 40:45.921
and TOYOTA.
