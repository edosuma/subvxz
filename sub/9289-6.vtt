00:13.912 --> 00:15.620
Roger, it's good to see you.

00:15.705 --> 00:19.952
I'd like to talk to you about this meeting.
I don't trust the ambassador.

00:20.043 --> 00:23.412
It's possible that his country's
supporting Second Wave.

00:23.505 --> 00:26.541
We want to prevent this incident.

00:26.633 --> 00:28.590
We need access to your files.

00:28.677 --> 00:31.250
I want you to monitor
how they use our intel.

00:32.012 --> 00:35.714
It's the ambassador's chopper.
It crashed just after takeoff.

00:36.852 --> 00:40.102
- There's a man who needs to talk to you.
- Who is he?

00:40.188 --> 00:42.810
He's from the Counter Terrorism Agency?

00:42.899 --> 00:44.892
I told you, I do not know a Syed Ali.

00:44.985 --> 00:49.314
Then how do you explain that his name
is in your personal computer files?

00:49.781 --> 00:54.609
There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
Do what I tell you. Go now.

00:54.703 --> 00:56.162
Miguel, get over here.

00:56.246 --> 00:57.954
There's a nuclear bomb in the city.

00:58.039 --> 01:00.957
- Let's get outta here.
- Not without Megan.

01:01.418 --> 01:05.416
George, I got to Wald. I found out
who commissioned him to take out CTU.

01:05.504 --> 01:07.581
- Who was it?
- It was Nina Myers.

01:07.674 --> 01:08.623
Nina?

01:08.717 --> 01:11.172
Nina killed your wife.
I don't want you near her.

01:11.261 --> 01:13.930
I have to grant her
a shadow asylum.

01:14.014 --> 01:15.923
That sounds like a pardon, sir.

01:16.016 --> 01:19.219
She has information
that could help us find this bomb.

01:19.311 --> 01:22.016
- What is it?
- They're gonna let her go.

01:22.481 --> 01:26.858
I know you were exposed to high levels
of radioactive materials this morning.

01:26.943 --> 01:31.237
I wanna know what your plans are for Nina.
I want the case. I know how she thinks.

01:31.323 --> 01:35.451
If you don't do this, I'll tell District
about your condition. They'll replace you.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.754
Palmer just signed the pardon.

02:24.954 --> 02:28.912
So, as soon as it gets here,
we'll start the interrogation.

02:44.020 --> 02:47.140
- Nina's file.
- I don't need it.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.083
The president's here.

03:21.558 --> 03:23.301
Mr. President...

03:23.393 --> 03:28.435
Mr. President, can you give us any
details about the helicopter crash?

03:28.523 --> 03:35.107
- Who was on the aircraft? Any survivors?
- Is it related to the bombing in LA?

03:35.197 --> 03:37.735
We can't disclose information
about the crash

03:37.824 --> 03:40.909
until the families of the victims
have been notified.

03:40.994 --> 03:45.241
But I promise you, there will be
a careful and thorough investigation.

03:45.332 --> 03:47.408
- Mr. President...
- Let's go.

03:47.501 --> 03:52.495
We will be putting out a formal statement
as soon as we get those issues resolved,

03:52.589 --> 03:56.918
and I ask everyone to refrain
from speculation until that time.

03:57.010 --> 04:00.177
No one besides Jenny releases
a statement on the crash.

04:00.263 --> 04:03.348
No names, no speculation.
And keep the lid on tight.

04:03.433 --> 04:05.509
Absolutely, sir.

04:19.574 --> 04:21.815
Hello, David.

04:21.910 --> 04:24.946
How did you get in here
without my authorisation?

04:25.038 --> 04:30.958
We were married for many years. Many
people respect that, even if you don't.

04:31.044 --> 04:32.835
I need to talk to you.

04:32.921 --> 04:37.334
We have nothing more to talk about.
You're not my wife any more.

04:37.426 --> 04:40.130
- It's not about us.
- Then what?

04:44.307 --> 04:48.257
Not here. I need to be alone with you.

04:48.353 --> 04:50.144
You know what?

04:50.230 --> 04:55.141
Even if I were interested in what
you had to say, today is impossible.

04:55.235 --> 04:57.904
You shouldn't have come here.

04:57.988 --> 05:01.191
- It's about your administration.
- What about it?

05:01.283 --> 05:04.367
- Just give me five minutes.
- I don't have time now.

05:04.453 --> 05:10.621
Did you order an evacuation of
military personnel out of Los Angeles?

05:28.310 --> 05:30.386
Who told you that?

05:32.189 --> 05:34.514
Five minutes, David.

05:37.027 --> 05:39.269
Wait here.

05:39.362 --> 05:41.853
I'll call you.

05:48.705 --> 05:52.039
Do we know about the military
moving personnel out of LA?

05:52.125 --> 05:56.953
No. Sir, you specifically requested
there be no evacuation.

05:57.047 --> 05:59.716
- Check into it.
- I certainly will.

06:00.509 --> 06:03.924
You're doing business
with a known terrorist,

06:04.012 --> 06:10.264
and you sit there with a straight face
and tell me you don't know what's going on?

06:13.522 --> 06:19.026
I grew up in London. I'm marrying
an American girl, a Protestant.

06:20.987 --> 06:25.199
So, if you're going to racially profile me,

06:26.618 --> 06:29.109
you should at least get it right.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.525
You ever hear of the
Finsbury Park Mosque?

06:36.028 --> 06:38.630
It's considered to be one of
the main recruitment centers

06:38.632 --> 06:40.999
for Islamic terrorists in the West.

06:42.204 --> 06:45.739
Our main targets are European Muslims

06:45.833 --> 06:49.036
with western educations, passports,

06:49.128 --> 06:53.624
and the potential
to blend into western society.

06:54.180 --> 06:59.084
And do you know where
that mosque is located?

07:03.022 --> 07:06.558
Your hometown... London.

07:08.717 --> 07:12.880
So tell me, Reza,
how's my racial profiling going now?

07:14.514 --> 07:16.756
I want a lawyer.

07:17.726 --> 07:19.101
No.

07:21.855 --> 07:26.102
- Did they find the black box yet?
- Not yet, Mr. President.

07:26.193 --> 07:28.435
How could something like this happen?

07:28.528 --> 07:34.483
I don't know. I've opened a multi-agency
investigation. NTSB is on the way.

07:34.576 --> 07:37.577
Lynne, schedule a call
with the prime minister.

07:37.663 --> 07:41.612
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna talk to him before rumours start.

07:41.708 --> 07:46.951
But I'm afraid they may not be far from
the truth. This was not an accident.

07:47.047 --> 07:50.630
I'm thinking along
the same lines, Mr. President.

07:50.717 --> 07:56.423
The prime minister may not have been happy
about the ambassador's cooperation with us.

07:56.515 --> 07:59.599
There's another possibility, Roger.

07:59.685 --> 08:02.639
I'm not following you, sir.

08:03.105 --> 08:06.106
- That we did it.
- Correct.

08:07.359 --> 08:09.019
That hardly seems likely.

08:09.111 --> 08:12.978
The ambassador took classified
information back to his government.

08:13.073 --> 08:17.450
- You both thought it was questionable.
- And if we were talking about it here,

08:17.536 --> 08:22.114
you can bet there are others back
in DC who feel even more strongly.

08:22.207 --> 08:26.999
Set up an independent investigator.
Let's find out exactly who was in the loop.

08:27.087 --> 08:28.712
Yes, sir.

08:38.056 --> 08:40.726
OK, this is it. Here we go.

08:42.602 --> 08:45.438
I'll show her this,
I'll let her start talking.

08:45.522 --> 08:49.140
Then I'll get you the stuff
she doesn't want us to know.

08:49.234 --> 08:53.695
The last time I let you interrogate
somebody, you shot him through the heart.

08:53.780 --> 08:57.066
I'm letting you do this,
but I hope I'm not making a mistake.

08:57.159 --> 08:59.614
No mistake, George.

09:00.621 --> 09:02.697
All right. Good luck.

09:59.513 --> 10:01.221
Let's keep this simple.

10:01.306 --> 10:06.680
If you wanna stop the bomb,
I need to be on a plane to Visalia now.

10:06.770 --> 10:11.432
Did you pick Visalia for a reason, or would
anywhere outside the blast zone work?

10:11.525 --> 10:15.024
- My contact is in Visalia.
- Who is it?

10:15.112 --> 10:18.812
The only person who can
tell us where the bomb is.

10:18.907 --> 10:22.241
I'm not gonna tell you who it is
till we get there.

10:22.327 --> 10:27.832
Fine. Then you can sit here
and wait for the blast to hit.

10:27.916 --> 10:31.700
Stop wasting time.
I have the president's signature.

10:31.795 --> 10:34.547
I'm here. He's not.

10:34.631 --> 10:38.380
And I'm not gonna make a move
until I believe you're credible.

10:38.468 --> 10:43.011
I'll only get the pardon if I stop the bomb.
Why wouldn't I do everything I can?

10:43.098 --> 10:46.218
Because you're worse than a traitor, Nina.

10:46.310 --> 10:49.560
You don't have a cause.
You don't believe in anything.

10:49.646 --> 10:52.849
But you would sell anyone out
to the highest bidder.

10:52.941 --> 10:57.235
So stop wasting my time! Gimme a name!

11:00.949 --> 11:03.025
Don't even bother, Jack.

11:03.118 --> 11:07.068
If you lay a hand on me,
you'll be taken off the case.

11:28.769 --> 11:32.303
You're just gonna have to follow my lead.

11:42.491 --> 11:44.614
Tell me everything I wanna know,

11:44.701 --> 11:49.244
or I swear to God, I will hurt you
before I kill you and no one will stop me.

11:49.331 --> 11:52.415
- Do you understand?
- Jack, let her go! Now!

12:10.727 --> 12:13.514
- All right, you're done. Get outta here.
- Why?

12:13.605 --> 12:16.179
Why? Because you've lost it! That's why.

12:16.275 --> 12:20.224
Right now she thinks she's
won the lottery. She's in control.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.858
You want her to tell the truth,
take that away.

12:22.948 --> 12:24.940
By killing her? That'll work.

12:25.033 --> 12:28.485
By giving her someone to answer to,
someone to be afraid of.

12:28.578 --> 12:33.075
She has to believe I'd be willing to put
my revenge over finding this bomb.

12:33.166 --> 12:37.247
- And you're telling me you're not.
- George, it had to look like that.

12:37.337 --> 12:41.335
Look at me. There's no emotion here.

12:41.425 --> 12:43.666
Now look at her.

12:44.928 --> 12:49.923
- What would your next move be?
- You need to let me go back in there,

12:50.017 --> 12:55.473
show her that I have the power
to do anything I want to her.

13:02.362 --> 13:07.736
- If I let you go back in there, you've got...
- All I need is five minutes.

13:09.119 --> 13:15.323
Just don't let anyone in that room
and raise the thermostat ten degrees.

13:16.168 --> 13:19.371
Are you gonna let me have five minutes?

13:21.673 --> 13:22.954
Yeah.

13:24.134 --> 13:25.676
Thank you.

13:36.396 --> 13:41.272
In the latest update,
we have Mr. President requesting...

13:52.829 --> 13:55.071
We need to talk.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.662
I told you to leave.

13:59.753 --> 14:02.326
Well...

14:02.422 --> 14:04.996
I'm not leaving.

14:05.092 --> 14:07.049
I'm your sister,

14:07.511 --> 14:10.465
and you can stay angry with me,

14:10.555 --> 14:14.138
but we need to figure out
what we're going to do.

14:14.226 --> 14:17.143
Do about what?

14:17.229 --> 14:19.305
The wedding.

14:23.485 --> 14:26.154
We may have to cancel.

14:28.323 --> 14:33.365
That would make you happy, wouldn't it?
Isn't that what you wanted all along?

14:33.453 --> 14:36.538
No. Not the marriage, Marie.

14:36.623 --> 14:38.782
Just the wedding.

14:39.918 --> 14:44.247
We can't do it today.
Let me help you take care of it.

14:44.339 --> 14:47.126
You are always pretending
you wanna help me.

14:47.217 --> 14:49.293
Pretending?

14:50.846 --> 14:56.931
I dropped out of school when Mom died to
take care of you, to keep this family together.

14:57.019 --> 15:00.222
So you'd have an excuse
for not having a relationship.

15:00.314 --> 15:04.726
"Dad needs me. Marie needs me." Now I don't
need you any more, you can't handle it!

15:04.818 --> 15:08.982
- I made sacrifices because...
- Then stop! Mom died a long time ago!

15:09.072 --> 15:14.030
So get your own life and stay outta mine!
We are not cancelling this wedding!

15:18.415 --> 15:22.116
She's not in intensive care or
the east wing. She's gotta be up here.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.377
How much time do we have to this nuke?

15:25.464 --> 15:29.212
- I don't know.
- What if Megan doesn't wanna come with us?

15:29.301 --> 15:31.377
I don't know.

15:33.388 --> 15:35.464
That's him.

15:42.731 --> 15:45.222
Mr. Matheson?

15:48.570 --> 15:53.695
The MRI confirmed that the pressure on
the brain was the result of the concussion.

15:54.576 --> 15:55.905
Meaning?

15:55.994 --> 16:01.783
That we won't release her until questions
about the sources of her injuries are resolved.

16:02.834 --> 16:07.081
Of course. Listen, I just wanna
do what's best for my little girl.

16:08.048 --> 16:12.211
Good. I'll check in on her
at the end of my rounds.

16:13.762 --> 16:19.681
And, Mr. Matheson, no cellphones in the
hospital. They interfere with the equipment.

16:19.768 --> 16:22.093
Of course. Sorry.

16:29.361 --> 16:32.528
Daddy, are you still mad at me?

16:32.614 --> 16:37.075
No, sweetie, no. Everything's fine.
Daddy's just tired.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.996
You need to get dressed, OK?

16:40.080 --> 16:43.081
- Mr. Matheson's office.
- Chelsea, it's me.

16:43.166 --> 16:47.496
Do something for me. Book me two seats
on the next flight to Mexico City.

16:47.587 --> 16:52.084
- But you have a meeting...
- I know. I'm asking you to cancel it.

16:52.175 --> 16:56.422
- What about your five o'clock?
- Cancel everything.

17:07.566 --> 17:10.353
Who is the man in Visalia?

17:15.115 --> 17:17.950
Who is the man in Visalia?

17:18.035 --> 17:21.451
Mamud Faheen.
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.

17:21.538 --> 17:23.780
That's not news! We've got his name!

17:23.874 --> 17:26.958
But you don't know where he is. I do.

17:27.044 --> 17:31.670
- What's the history of the relationship?
- He introduced me to Wald.

17:31.757 --> 17:36.798
So Wald could buy the schematics
for CTU and blow it up as a diversion?

17:36.887 --> 17:40.470
I didn't know it was part of a plan
to detonate a nuclear device.

17:40.557 --> 17:43.179
Then why are you so sure
Faheen's involved?

17:43.268 --> 17:46.851
I heard hints that he was involved
in something in Los Angeles.

17:46.939 --> 17:49.560
Something substantial.

17:57.824 --> 18:00.944
Where is he in Visalia now?

18:01.036 --> 18:05.034
I'm not gonna give you his location
until we get there.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.252
If you could get to him, you wouldn't need
me. My deal would do me no good if I'm dead.

18:28.981 --> 18:31.057
Get me Visalia.

18:55.757 --> 18:57.299
Sir...

18:58.635 --> 19:03.926
Sherry was right. An evacuation of
military personnel began about an hour ago,

19:04.016 --> 19:06.092
which means it is well under way.

19:06.184 --> 19:12.187
- Do we know where this order came from?
- Yes, we do, sir. Roger Stanton.

19:13.525 --> 19:15.814
Countermand the evacuation.

19:15.902 --> 19:19.817
All forces already moving are to
return to their bases immediately.

19:19.906 --> 19:21.983
Yes, sir.

19:22.993 --> 19:25.531
Roger. My office, please.

19:25.621 --> 19:30.448
Janet? Hi, this is Lynne. I'm gonna need
contacts for the following bases:

19:30.542 --> 19:32.784
Point Mugu, Camp Pendleton.

19:37.674 --> 19:41.375
I got word that military resources
were being moved out of LA.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.427
- Yes.
- On your order.

19:43.513 --> 19:49.634
Yes. I was implementing the plan.
I assumed you authorised it.

19:49.728 --> 19:53.892
No, I told Rayburn not to
trigger any evacuation.

19:59.112 --> 20:03.655
I should have double-checked everything
Rayburn told me before I took any action.

20:03.742 --> 20:08.238
Mr. President, it's inexcusable.
I take full responsibility.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.903
We'll worry about that later.

20:10.999 --> 20:16.041
I just told Lynne to countermand
the evacuation order.

20:16.129 --> 20:20.791
- Make sure it happens immediately.
- Right away, sir.

20:26.807 --> 20:28.147
Can I help you, Mr. President?

20:28.192 --> 20:32.762
Yes. Tell Sherry I'll
meet her in 20 minutes.

20:33.105 --> 20:35.975
You know how much
Daddy loves you, don't you?

20:38.568 --> 20:44.025
And you know how sorry I am that
my little angel ever got hurt, right?

20:52.207 --> 20:55.493
Listen, pal, we're leaving now, OK?

20:56.795 --> 21:02.002
So if anybody tries to talk to you,
you just... you don't say a word. OK?

21:02.092 --> 21:06.220
Just pretend you're asleep.
You can do that, right?

21:06.305 --> 21:07.680
- OK.
- OK.

21:07.764 --> 21:09.757
Mr. Matheson?

21:11.560 --> 21:14.133
There's a call for you.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.021
A call?

21:18.233 --> 21:22.397
- You can take it at the nurse's station.
- Why can't I take it in here?

21:22.487 --> 21:26.817
Because we don't have phones
in the rooms unless you order one.

21:31.705 --> 21:34.576
You stay there, OK?

21:36.293 --> 21:38.700
Megan, don't move.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.590
- Looks like she'll be fine.
- OK.

21:45.677 --> 21:49.722
- OK? Just running a few other tests.
- Is it gonna be much longer?

21:49.806 --> 21:51.598
The phone's right in there.

21:51.683 --> 21:54.174
So let's go take a look, OK?

21:58.148 --> 22:01.351
- This is Gary Matheson.
- Mr. Matheson?

22:01.443 --> 22:05.026
- Yeah, who is this?
- This is Trey in Accounts Receivable.

22:05.113 --> 22:09.692
Our computers crashed, and we lost
a lot of your billing information.

22:09.785 --> 22:12.988
So if we could just go over it again...

22:13.080 --> 22:17.243
- Can we do this another time, please?
- No, we need it now, sir.

22:17.334 --> 22:19.955
I can send someone up
to your daughter's room.

22:22.506 --> 22:24.712
No. What do you need?

22:29.346 --> 22:31.967
- Hi, Kim.
- Hi, sweetie.

22:35.936 --> 22:39.934
- Listen, do you trust me?
- Yes.

22:40.482 --> 22:42.890
I need to get you outta here.

22:42.985 --> 22:49.237
All I can tell you is I'm doing this because
I love you and I want you to be safe. OK?

22:57.791 --> 22:59.665
OK.

22:59.751 --> 23:01.495
Come on.

23:01.586 --> 23:05.798
- The expiration date?
- It expires March 2007, OK?

23:05.882 --> 23:09.832
Great. Now if we could just
go over your billing address.

23:09.928 --> 23:12.502
You know what? I'll come down later.

23:12.598 --> 23:14.674
Mr. Matheson?

23:27.654 --> 23:29.481
Megan?

23:35.120 --> 23:38.287
- My daughter's gone.
- Did you try the bathroom?

23:38.373 --> 23:42.501
- Yes. She's not there.
- She might have been taken to radiology.

23:42.586 --> 23:45.077
Well, find out where she is.

23:45.172 --> 23:47.248
Yes, of course.

23:51.595 --> 23:56.387
Dr Shapiro, 2262. Dr Shapiro, 2262.

24:16.203 --> 24:20.995
- Where are we going, Kim?
- I told you, you have to trust me.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.752
I just got off the phone. Come on.

24:23.835 --> 24:26.124
I changed my mind. I don't wanna go.

24:26.213 --> 24:31.587
My daddy's gonna get really mad, and then
he's gonna hurt me. I don't wanna go.

24:31.677 --> 24:34.512
We need to go because
your dad is hurting you.

24:34.596 --> 24:37.514
And your mom is trying to
stop him, but she can't.

24:37.599 --> 24:41.264
He's gonna keep hurting you
unless you leave with us.

24:41.353 --> 24:45.398
That's the only way anyone is gonna
stop him. Do you understand me?

24:45.482 --> 24:48.103
Your daughter's not with
any of the departments.

24:48.193 --> 24:51.479
- Then where is she?
- I'm trying to figure that out.

24:51.571 --> 24:56.399
- Did you see anyone near her room?
- No! Call security! Find me my daughter!

24:56.493 --> 25:00.325
Megan, I need you to
breathe and calm down

25:00.414 --> 25:03.747
and stop crying, so we can leave now. OK?

25:04.793 --> 25:06.038
Come on.

25:06.128 --> 25:08.749
I miss my mom. I want my mom!

25:09.298 --> 25:12.298
I know. Come on with me. I know.

25:19.349 --> 25:25.601
Look out for a nine-year-old girl with
blonde hair, striped top and blue jeans.

25:25.689 --> 25:28.476
I've got Third Street, west door covered.

25:32.195 --> 25:34.271
In there.

25:58.096 --> 26:03.091
Just got a team on the ground in Visalia,
and more coming in from Fresno.

26:03.185 --> 26:07.265
Division's loaned us some men,
so I'm sending Miller along with you.

26:07.356 --> 26:09.147
I can handle her myself.

26:09.232 --> 26:11.902
That's not what I'm worried about.

26:12.903 --> 26:18.906
Do you think I'd sentence millions to death
just for the satisfaction of killing her?

26:22.621 --> 26:24.697
I'll do my job.

26:24.790 --> 26:28.538
I'm just sending Miller along
to make sure of that.

26:56.238 --> 26:59.903
You should go be with your family.

26:59.992 --> 27:02.909
You should get on a plane.

27:05.455 --> 27:08.659
- I'll call you when we're in the air.
- Yeah. Good.

27:14.256 --> 27:15.086
David...

27:15.173 --> 27:18.507
How did you find out about
the military evacuation?

27:18.594 --> 27:20.253
I made some phone calls.

27:20.345 --> 27:24.213
Just following up on a rumour.
I can't tell you any more than that.

27:24.308 --> 27:28.471
You will tell me more,
and I will not ask you again.

27:30.564 --> 27:34.229
I am not a member of your staff, David.
I am your wife.

27:34.318 --> 27:38.565
Ex-wife, and you will tell me because
the safety and security of this country

27:38.655 --> 27:41.277
is more important than your power plays.

27:41.366 --> 27:45.660
You know, despite everything
that's happened, I love you.

27:45.746 --> 27:48.237
- Oh, please.
- No, I always will.

27:48.332 --> 27:50.011
Whether you want to believe it or not,

27:50.023 --> 27:54.666
everything that I have done has
been in your best interest.

27:56.757 --> 28:00.042
If you won't give me
a second chance at your heart,

28:00.135 --> 28:03.219
let me help in the ways you know I can.

28:03.305 --> 28:09.557
And I can't help you, David, unless you
give me some idea of what you're facing.

28:12.147 --> 28:15.682
I was able to find something
your own staff couldn't find.

28:15.776 --> 28:20.770
I didn't have to warn you.
I came here on my own accord.

28:26.244 --> 28:30.076
Terrorists have planned
a strike against Los Angeles.

28:30.165 --> 28:32.407
NSA thinks it'll be today.

28:32.501 --> 28:35.074
What kind of strike?

28:35.170 --> 28:37.246
Nuclear.

28:37.339 --> 28:39.664
Oh, my G...

28:39.758 --> 28:41.834
Oh, my God.

28:44.846 --> 28:47.219
Talk to me, Sherry.

28:49.601 --> 28:51.428
Come on.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.971
I got the information about
the military evacuation

28:55.065 --> 28:58.149
from someone inside
the defence department.

28:58.235 --> 28:59.646
Who?

28:59.736 --> 29:04.647
A high-level staffer. He's in the loop.
He owed me a favour.

29:04.741 --> 29:07.315
But there's something more important.

29:07.411 --> 29:12.452
He also told me that there are members of
your own administration allying against you.

29:12.541 --> 29:16.289
They want control of your presidency.

29:16.378 --> 29:19.047
That's why I came here today.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.918
Who, Sherry?

29:22.009 --> 29:24.312
People who disagree with your policies,

29:24.612 --> 29:27.169
who want to impose their
will on the country.

29:27.264 --> 29:31.842
There have been deals made under
the table, David. Back-room promises.

29:31.935 --> 29:35.351
Now, I can keep digging, find out.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.514
If you want my help.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.544
If I accept your help, it won't be about us.

29:59.630 --> 30:03.378
It'll be about doing
what's best for the country.

30:03.467 --> 30:07.416
Sweetheart, you can call it
anything you want.

30:09.890 --> 30:13.804
I'll get you a secure line
and a private place to make your calls.

30:13.894 --> 30:17.844
Then I'll come to you
as soon as I find out more.

30:23.654 --> 30:27.153
This had better not be
one of your manipulations.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.529
The stakes are too high.

30:51.932 --> 30:54.719
- Dad?
- Hm?

30:54.810 --> 30:58.179
- Reza's parents are here.
- I'm on the phone to your grandmother.

30:58.272 --> 31:01.391
I'll be right there.

31:04.361 --> 31:06.235
Oh!

31:06.321 --> 31:08.397
You're here!

31:09.241 --> 31:10.439
Welcome.

31:11.159 --> 31:13.697
- So nice to see you, Kate.
- Come on in.

31:13.787 --> 31:17.405
Thank you. The house looks beautiful.

31:17.499 --> 31:20.037
Oh, thank you.

31:20.127 --> 31:24.705
Well... you must be tired.
Let's go into the living room.

31:24.798 --> 31:26.506
OK.

31:28.135 --> 31:30.804
So, how is everyone holding up?

31:30.887 --> 31:32.963
Not too bad.

31:33.056 --> 31:35.428
Where is Reza?

31:35.517 --> 31:38.886
Um, well, there's a small problem
we're dealing with.

31:38.979 --> 31:41.221
What kind of problem?

31:42.691 --> 31:47.686
Um, some men from the government
are here talking to him.

31:48.697 --> 31:50.773
About?

31:52.034 --> 31:56.162
- It's a criminal investigation.
- I don't understand.

31:56.246 --> 31:59.745
- It's very complicated.
- Kate, what is going on?

31:59.833 --> 32:04.709
- It would be best if Reza told you himself.
- Told us what?

32:06.840 --> 32:13.293
They're talking to Reza about his possible
involvement in terrorist activities.

32:13.388 --> 32:16.757
- That is absurd!
- This must be a mistake.

32:16.850 --> 32:20.053
- That's what they're trying to find out.
- You see?

32:20.145 --> 32:24.807
Your country, you talk about tolerance,
you talk about freedom,

32:24.900 --> 32:28.233
but you treat every Middle Easterner
like terrorist!

32:28.320 --> 32:32.733
No! No, of course not.
I'm sure it'll all get sorted out.

32:32.824 --> 32:36.443
- Rima, Hassan...
- Bob, do you know about this?

32:36.536 --> 32:42.456
They just showed up about an hour ago.
I know nothing else. I'm sorry.

32:43.710 --> 32:46.166
Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.

32:57.557 --> 32:59.799
Wait for me in the parking lot.

32:59.893 --> 33:05.896
If it's more than ten minutes, it means
they caught me, so take off without me.

33:07.317 --> 33:11.018
You can't let them.
We are gonna leave all together.

33:13.198 --> 33:14.573
OK?

33:19.746 --> 33:21.490
Miguel.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.159
Thank you.

33:42.477 --> 33:45.099
Are you OK to walk by yourself?

33:45.188 --> 33:47.098
Yeah? Good girl.

33:50.902 --> 33:52.694
Hey! Hey!

33:52.779 --> 33:56.943
I got a male Hispanic, early 20s,
running out with a computer monitor.

33:57.034 --> 33:59.110
Hey, come on!

34:04.374 --> 34:05.868
Shh.

34:16.969 --> 34:18.168
Go that way!

35:16.154 --> 35:18.194
So, Ed, how are ya?

35:18.282 --> 35:20.321
Don't bother, Nina.

35:20.409 --> 35:25.534
I'm here because I have to be,
not because I'm your friend.

35:25.622 --> 35:31.127
You're here because they think, after I help
stop the bomb, Jack will try to kill me.

35:31.211 --> 35:33.453
Which, of course, he will.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.092
And what if you can't stop him?

35:37.175 --> 35:39.298
I mean, no offense,

35:39.386 --> 35:43.300
but, Ed, let's face it,
you're no match for Jack.

35:44.683 --> 35:47.008
You're just not that ruthless.

35:50.439 --> 35:55.860
So he manages to get around you
and pull the trigger. What happens then?

35:57.613 --> 36:02.191
Because of the pardon, he knows if he
kills me, he'll spend the rest of his life in jail.

36:02.284 --> 36:06.329
Jack, if you have some way to
shut her up I'm not thinking of...

36:06.413 --> 36:11.953
Of course, Jack's mind is thinking
"That's not such a bad deal."

36:14.921 --> 36:19.050
Small price to pay to avenge
his wife's death.

36:19.134 --> 36:23.713
But what about his daughter?
Is he thinking about her?

36:24.723 --> 36:29.848
She's already lost one parent.
If he kills me, she'll have no one.

36:34.024 --> 36:36.776
Jack knows I'm right.

36:36.860 --> 36:41.985
He should just use me to stop the bomb,
and then go home to Kim.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.370
She needs you, Jack.

37:08.809 --> 37:13.684
- I didn't transfer that money.
- You transferred it into that account.

37:13.772 --> 37:15.017
I didn't!

37:15.107 --> 37:18.440
Then you better tell me who did,
or I'm taking you in!

37:18.527 --> 37:20.566
Why are you doing this?

37:20.654 --> 37:22.777
Friends of mine...

37:24.449 --> 37:28.696
who were doing their best to protect
the citizens of this country

37:28.787 --> 37:34.623
were murdered today... probably by
the same people you're funding!

37:36.295 --> 37:39.580
That a good enough reason for you?

37:39.673 --> 37:41.749
I told you before...

37:44.553 --> 37:47.470
I don't know anything else.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.401
Your parents.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.123
All right, stand up, Reza.

38:22.215 --> 38:25.051
Place your hands behind your head.

38:30.515 --> 38:34.050
It's a shame. It's gonna break their heart.

38:35.228 --> 38:37.802
I have to walk you right past them.

38:37.898 --> 38:41.848
And they're gonna see
who their son really is.

38:45.113 --> 38:46.821
Wait!

38:51.370 --> 38:55.830
I confirmed the transfers,
but I didn't make them.

38:55.916 --> 38:59.201
I was just covering the records.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.582
I didn't want him to get into trouble.

39:05.092 --> 39:08.876
Who? Who are you covering for?

39:11.515 --> 39:16.805
Come on, who transferred that money
into Syed Ali's accounts?

39:23.568 --> 39:25.645
Bob Warner.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.316
Marie's father.

39:47.634 --> 39:49.294
What?

39:49.386 --> 39:52.221
- What's the matter?
- I don't feel very well.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.770
Come on, Miguel.

40:09.531 --> 40:11.607
Get away from us!

40:11.700 --> 40:15.199
Give her to me, or I will make sure
you go to prison for 20 years.

40:15.287 --> 40:18.241
- I know how she got hurt.
- That was an accident!

40:18.332 --> 40:19.992
Like Carla's bruises?

40:40.771 --> 40:42.929
- It's OK.
- Miguel...

40:49.363 --> 40:52.233
Let's just get outta here.

40:55.452 --> 40:57.824
Get his car keys.

41:21.228 --> 41:24.182
- Reza.
- Sweetheart, angel.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.900
- You OK?
- Yes.

41:30.279 --> 41:34.193
- They know I didn't do anything.
- Oh, thank God.

41:34.283 --> 41:39.110
- We can get married today.
- I don't know, sweetheart.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.074
Mr. Warner.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.705
Could you follow me, please, sir?

41:45.794 --> 41:50.456
- What does this have to do with me?
- Just come with me, please.

41:53.635 --> 41:56.007
What did you tell them?

41:56.096 --> 41:58.338
The truth.

41:58.432 --> 42:03.722
- The truth? What do you mean, the truth?
- Please, my parents are very upset.

42:17.492 --> 42:19.200
Hurry.

42:35.427 --> 42:37.052
Yeah.

42:37.387 --> 42:39.463
Yeah. OK.

42:40.432 --> 42:44.264
The team's in Visalia.
We'll have tactical and field units.

42:44.353 --> 42:47.354
We have confirmation that they're in place?

42:47.439 --> 42:49.681
Probably in the air.

42:52.444 --> 42:55.362
We'll have air traffic, um...

42:58.116 --> 43:00.156
Air traffic priority?

43:01.036 --> 43:03.159
Yeah...

43:03.246 --> 43:05.535
Tra...

43:05.624 --> 43:06.454
Jack...

43:06.541 --> 43:09.957
It's all right, Ed. It's all right.
Just take it easy.
