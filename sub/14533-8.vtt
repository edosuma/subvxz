WEBVTT

00:12.417 --> 00:13.875
LEE: We've got Brown exactly
where we want her.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.667
One push and she falls
into the Grand Canyon.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.291
-If she can fit.
-If she can fit.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.250
'Cause she's so big
there's no way she can fit.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.000
-I got it.
-Yeah.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.959
Can we please go home?

00:23.959 --> 00:25.792
I failed you as a husband.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.542
But please don't
let me fail my boys.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.500
BELINDA: With everything
I'm going through,

00:29.500 --> 00:32.583
it's a comfort to know
I can trust the two of you.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.583
Oh, Mr. Russell...

00:35.834 --> 00:37.500
LEE:
I'm gonna make you a new one.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.917
What's going on with
you and Gamby?

00:38.917 --> 00:40.125
Gale, I just did it

00:40.125 --> 00:41.667
with the hottest teacher
in school.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.792
GALE: Neal, stop.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.291
Janelle's been in an accident.

00:53.125 --> 00:55.792
There are four pieces.
(sighs)

00:55.792 --> 00:57.834
Winter Concert
is this week.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.542
And of course,
Brown is relying on me

00:59.542 --> 01:01.208
to practically
run the whole thing.

01:01.208 --> 01:03.000
Is that why you're picking up
her dry cleaning?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.750
I'm in charge of more
than just this.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.542
I have real responsibilities.
You know that, Christine.

01:07.542 --> 01:09.458
(shouting in Korean)

01:09.458 --> 01:10.959
You mind
your own fuckin' business.

01:10.959 --> 01:12.917
Isn't this
her assistant's job?

01:12.917 --> 01:14.667
It's called being
a good person.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.834
Maybe you should try it
sometimes...
(phone beeps)

01:16.834 --> 01:19.500
...instead of kissing
doctors' asses all day.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.041
It's the hospital.
Meet me outside.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.375
Bitch boy.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.083
Not another fucking word
out of you.

01:25.083 --> 01:27.542
(whispering)
Bitch boy, bitch boy,
bitch boy...

01:27.542 --> 01:30.959
Uh, can you please
just put this on debit, please?

01:30.959 --> 01:33.375
Bitch boy!
What's she calling you?
"Beach boy"?

01:33.375 --> 01:35.375
Nothing! Can I please
get a receipt, please?

01:35.375 --> 01:37.792
Bitchy boy!
Oh.

01:37.792 --> 01:40.500
Just--
Bitch boy, bitch boy,
bitch boy!

01:40.500 --> 01:42.458
Bitch boy, bitch boy!

01:42.458 --> 01:44.041
Bitchy boy-- Aah!

01:44.041 --> 01:48.208
(theme music playing)

01:55.834 --> 01:58.417
Mario:
You know how sharks
make babies?

01:58.417 --> 02:01.041
The spray the water like,
skeet, skeet, skeet!

02:01.041 --> 02:04.667
Yes! Skeet, skeet, skeet!
Mm! Y'all is crazy.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.125
(laughing)
Skeet!

02:07.125 --> 02:10.458
You know, I'm happy
as shit, Belinda.

02:10.458 --> 02:11.583
Thank you.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.125
Well, the boys
sure did miss you.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.875
Wish I could turn
the clock back a year,

02:15.875 --> 02:17.959
to when shit was
like this for real.

02:17.959 --> 02:20.875
Well, I wish
a lot of things.

02:22.125 --> 02:25.125
Sometimes we take
what we can get.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.542
You honestly gonna act
like you ain't having fun?

02:28.542 --> 02:32.000
Me, the boys, fish.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.375
I'm having
a little bit of fun.

02:34.375 --> 02:38.000
(both laugh)

02:47.583 --> 02:52.083
(funk music playing)

03:03.834 --> 03:06.583
Whoa. I can't believe
you let me fuck you in a bus.

03:06.583 --> 03:09.000
Hey.
Can you imagine if we
got caught doing that?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.625
We'd lose our jobs.
Well...

03:10.625 --> 03:12.583
Motherfucker.
...you'd better play it
cool then.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.000
You better play it cool.
Mr. Gamby! There you are.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.750
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.083
We have a Code 13
in the auditorium!

03:19.083 --> 03:22.083
Who the hell Code-13s at
ten o'clock in the morning?

03:22.083 --> 03:25.166
(making monkey sounds)
Strombone!

03:25.166 --> 03:27.000
Get down from there,
right now!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Jesus!
How the hell
did this happen?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.834
The whole group of 'em,
right there, is drunk!

03:31.834 --> 03:34.750
Hey, idiots!
I fail to see
what's funny here.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.375
(laughter, monkey sounds)
Hey!

03:36.375 --> 03:38.125
I don't want to see
anyone's goddamn teeth.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.917
You understand?
Zip the lips, purse them now.

03:40.917 --> 03:43.625
(students screaming)

03:43.625 --> 03:46.041
Oh, my God!
Holy shit. Great.

03:46.041 --> 03:49.208
This is why you don't drink
Icehouse at band practice.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.667
Mmm.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.500
Hope you all are proud
of yourselves.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.834
Jason Strombone is
in the emergency room.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.792
Because of your poor choices,

03:56.792 --> 03:59.792
none of you
will be participating
in the Winter Concert.

03:59.792 --> 04:02.375
I'm first chair.
My grandparents are
coming in from out of town.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.291
Mr. Gamby's
going easy on you.

04:04.291 --> 04:07.792
If it were up to me,
I'd kick all of y'all
out of school.

04:07.792 --> 04:11.208
I have zero tolerance
for drinking.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.000
You know why I got
that Tanqueray tattooed
on my back?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Because you like gin?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.792
No. Because me and gin
don't get along.

04:26.792 --> 04:29.458
I had a problem
since my first sip at 13.

04:29.458 --> 04:33.542
Kept sipping too.
Made me a whole
different person.

04:33.542 --> 04:36.041
Shit got me turked up!

04:36.041 --> 04:38.041
Put me in beast mode.

04:38.041 --> 04:39.875
Take a sip Friday evening
in Philly,

04:39.875 --> 04:41.834
I'd wake up Monday morning
in Arkansas,

04:41.834 --> 04:45.458
all bit up by chiggers,
no-- no memory of how
I got there.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.583
But thankfully,

04:47.583 --> 04:50.000
my life took a positive turn

04:50.000 --> 04:53.708
and I was blessed
with two fine sons.

04:53.708 --> 04:57.458
And I guess that made me
realize what I had to lose.

04:57.458 --> 05:02.375
And that, Miss Missy,
is why I put that tattoo
on my back.

05:02.375 --> 05:06.208
Because the drinking,
that's behind me now.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.166
And I want y'all to put it
behind y'all too.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.625
Am I clear?

05:09.625 --> 05:11.750
One week, ISS circle.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.125
No Winter Concert,
and, of course,

05:14.125 --> 05:18.667
all of y'all parents
are gonna hear from me.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.917
I'm sorry for interfering
back there, Mr. Gamby.

05:23.917 --> 05:26.375
I just have strong opinions
on the matter.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.834
No, no, no worries.
Uh, I appreciate it.

05:28.834 --> 05:32.750
I... I respected the fact
that you related it
to your own struggles.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.375
Kudrows.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.125
Mr. Gamby?

05:36.125 --> 05:40.083
How would you like to be
vice principal, by yourself?

05:40.083 --> 05:43.708
We'd create the position
Chief Accountability Officer
for you.

05:43.708 --> 05:46.792
You'd receive a substantial
increase in salary as well.

05:46.792 --> 05:50.083
We'd run North Jackson
High School as equals.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.041
What about Mr. Russell?

05:52.041 --> 05:55.083
From what I hear,
you two don't get along
already.

05:55.083 --> 05:58.083
You wouldn't shed a tear
if he was gone, now would you?

05:58.083 --> 06:01.000
No. I mean, I don't care
for that man one bit, so...

06:01.000 --> 06:04.333
That man ain't even
a snake in the grass.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.583
Damn worm in the dirt.
Look at him.

06:06.583 --> 06:10.041
Hey, B! I got your,
uh, your coffee

06:10.041 --> 06:12.875
and your-- Move--
and your dry cleaning.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.750
Just go put 'em
in my office.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.291
Yeah?

06:16.291 --> 06:18.250
(mutters) Bitch.
Okay.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.542
Okay!
Did you just call him a bitch?

06:20.542 --> 06:23.792
He act like a bitch,
walk like a bitch.
Whew.

06:23.792 --> 06:26.250
Mm. Yeah, look at his pants.

06:26.250 --> 06:29.000
Bitch.
I'd never wear pants like that.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.333
You better not.
I'd call you a bitch.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.792
So what did she say about me?
She talk shit?

06:35.792 --> 06:38.250
No, she was mainly
just talking about herself,
you know?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.500
Just being boastful,
cocky, braggadocious,

06:40.500 --> 06:43.291
you know,
just showing hubris.
What's that?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.375
It's a fucking spy pen
is what it is.

06:45.375 --> 06:49.125
You see this right here?
There's a little camera
inside there.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.875
Next time she starts
running her mouth,
talking shit,

06:51.875 --> 06:53.750
I'm gonna get it
all on video,

06:53.750 --> 06:55.583
publish it online,

06:55.583 --> 06:57.834
let the court
of public opinion
do the rest.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.208
Jeez, man, listen to yourself,
talking about spy pens

07:00.208 --> 07:01.583
and court of public opinion.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.959
I mean, you're grasping
at straws, Russell.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.500
You're being a bitch.

07:07.625 --> 07:11.333
All my hopes and dreams
on a fucking pen.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.166
I'm just at a loss here.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.667
Every single thing we throw
at this woman fails.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.000
My fucking family
is retarded.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.542
Brown treats me
like a house slave.
I just--

07:21.542 --> 07:24.333
I just can't exist
like this.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.250
Russell, are you crying?

07:26.250 --> 07:28.792
No! I'm not fucking crying.

07:28.792 --> 07:30.667
God! Gamby, you wish.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.000
Well, you know, as much
as I'd like to commiserate
with you,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.750
I got a hot date.
I'm going out with Snodgrass
and my daughter.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.208
Fine, great!
Snodgrass and your daughter.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.417
Go empty your balls.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.500
Don't worry about anything
but your erection.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.708
Russell, how many times
do I have to tell you this?

07:45.708 --> 07:47.875
I do not like when you talk
about my private parts, okay?

07:47.875 --> 07:49.417
Please don't do it again.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.041
I'm really going
to have to do

07:51.041 --> 07:53.041
the whole pen-blackmail
thing all by myself?

07:53.041 --> 07:55.125
The mission is always
my top concern, okay?

07:55.125 --> 07:57.959
Just because I have
a girlfriend and things
are finally going in my favor,

07:57.959 --> 07:59.625
that doesn't change anything.

07:59.625 --> 08:03.083
I'll see you, Lee.
Okay?

08:06.333 --> 08:09.041
Oh. Oh my God.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.333
You're lucky
it's only cosmetic damage.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.291
You know, I think
there's a valuable lesson
to be learned here.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.041
My daddy always said,
if you fall, you can't quit.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.875
You gotta get right back
on the horse.

08:18.875 --> 08:21.500
On the horse?
How dare you
mention horses

08:21.500 --> 08:24.250
when you forced us
to sell Shadowfax?

08:24.250 --> 08:27.000
What? No.
Hey, I didn't make anyone
sell anything.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.792
That is not fair, Neal.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.417
You know what?
I don't give a...
(whispers) fuck

08:30.417 --> 08:32.166
about what's fair
and what's not fair,

08:32.166 --> 08:34.542
'cause I'm gonna tell you
right now, there is
no more motorcycles.

08:34.542 --> 08:35.917
I don't want to hear
either of you

08:35.917 --> 08:37.959
trying to talk her into
that... (whispers) shit.
You hear me?

08:37.959 --> 08:39.291
Not another...
(whispers) fuckin' word.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.291
If you want someone
to sever their spinal cord

08:41.291 --> 08:43.625
and get killed,
then put Gale on
the motorcycle.

08:43.625 --> 08:44.917
(laughs)
Not my daughter!

08:44.917 --> 08:46.417
From now on,
she's doing what I say

08:46.417 --> 08:48.250
because I won.
Conversation over.

08:48.250 --> 08:51.917
This is Janelle's choice,
not yours.

08:51.917 --> 08:54.375
(speaking gibberish
with a French accent)

08:54.375 --> 08:56.250
Janelle, tell these people.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.208
Do you want
to ride motorcycles

08:58.208 --> 08:59.708
and potentially
split your face open,

08:59.708 --> 09:02.000
have your guts and blood
all over the dusty ground,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.625
sit in a wheelchair
and roll around for
the rest of your life,

09:04.625 --> 09:06.542
having everyone look at you
and feel sorry for you--

09:06.542 --> 09:08.625
Baby, it's okay.
You can tell him
the truth, sweetheart.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.041
Speak from your heart.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.083
I don't want to do
motocross anymore.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.291
I-- I'm just not good
at it.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.458
Baby.
Of course you're not,
sweetheart.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.667
You suck at it.
Let's go.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.250
Have another glass
of wine, Gale.
Numb yourself.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.583
I have a headache.

09:25.583 --> 09:28.125
(rock music playing)

09:28.125 --> 09:31.291
(laughing)

09:31.291 --> 09:33.250
(screaming)

09:39.166 --> 09:41.291
Yeah!
There you go!

09:41.291 --> 09:42.917
Whoa! Yeah!

09:49.041 --> 09:50.792
Gamby:
You know, I'm having
so much fun.

09:50.792 --> 09:53.500
Honestly, I haven't been
this happy in a long,
long time.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.959
Me too. I like
this version of you.

09:55.959 --> 09:59.458
You should be this
more often.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.917
Tell me, what's your take
on Lee Russell?

10:02.917 --> 10:05.166
Mr. Russell at school?
He's okay.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.667
Some people would say
that the school would run
a lot better

10:07.667 --> 10:09.125
if he wasn't around.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.708
I don't really
have an opinion.

10:10.708 --> 10:13.583
Our paths don't cross.
And I thought you guys
were friends?

10:13.583 --> 10:16.125
Not friends.
We're colleagues, yes,
of course.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.417
You know?
Nothing more, nothing less.

10:18.417 --> 10:22.667
No loyalty. We don't owe
each other anything.
Okay.

10:22.667 --> 10:27.125
But your day-to-day
wouldn't change if
Lee Russell wasn't around?

10:27.125 --> 10:29.041
Nope. Not one bit.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.542
Good to know.
Yeah.

10:31.542 --> 10:35.083
Janelle? Janelle,
don't do it. Janelle...

10:35.083 --> 10:37.542
No.
...don't-- Janelle!
Goddamn it!

10:37.542 --> 10:39.375
Janelle! Jeez!
(laughing)

10:39.375 --> 10:41.708
Thank You for this food
we are about to receive

10:41.708 --> 10:43.625
and thank You
for this day

10:43.625 --> 10:46.208
and bless these men
at this table.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.542
Amen.
Amen.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.750
So, Dascious,

10:51.750 --> 10:54.375
school is having
a winter concert,

10:54.375 --> 10:56.625
and I was thinking
if you're still around,

10:56.625 --> 10:59.250
maybe we could go
to Olive Garden afterwards

10:59.250 --> 11:02.375
and try those never-ending
pasta balls.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.667
Hmm. Actually...
(clears throat)

11:04.667 --> 11:09.250
Belinda, me and the boys
wanted to talk to you
about something.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.750
You and the boys?
Well, yeah, you know, we...

11:11.750 --> 11:14.250
we been discussing
some stuff.

11:14.250 --> 11:17.166
And, well, there's something
we wanted to discuss with you.

11:17.166 --> 11:20.083
Well, what y'all
want to tell me?

11:22.875 --> 11:24.834
We don't want
to live here no more.

11:24.834 --> 11:27.333
We don't want to live
in this hotel.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.542
We been through this
already, boys.

11:29.542 --> 11:31.542
This arrangement
is just temporary.

11:31.542 --> 11:33.750
Yeah, but you
been telling them that
for a few months now, Belinda,

11:33.750 --> 11:36.500
and ain't nothing change.
I mean, they been
through enough.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.375
It's time for them
to go back to Philly.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.500
You have no idea
what they've been through.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.708
'Cause your ass
just got here.

11:42.708 --> 11:45.959
He is right, Mama.
We really do want
to go back to Philly.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.583
Yeah, Mama.
Can we?

11:48.583 --> 11:51.500
Y'all want to go back
to Philly?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.625
Then go.
For real?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.542
Yes, for real.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.083
If it's that important to you

11:57.083 --> 11:58.792
that you want
to leave your mama

11:58.792 --> 12:01.834
for some Johnny Come Lately,
then I don't want you here.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.750
See, now this ain't got
to turn ugly, Belinda. Damn.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.417
No, I'm being straight up.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.959
They can pack
their shit and go,
as far as I'm concerned.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.291
Be careful what you say now.

12:10.291 --> 12:11.917
You want me to say it again?

12:11.917 --> 12:14.667
'Cause I can say it slowly.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.333
Pack yo...

12:18.333 --> 12:20.291
shit.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.458
She gets along great
with Janelle.

12:52.458 --> 12:54.125
I'm not trying
to jinx anything,

12:54.125 --> 12:55.792
but I think I may have
found my soul mate.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.750
So she is a freak
in the sack then, huh?

12:57.750 --> 12:59.917
Dayshaun, gentlemen
never kiss and tell,

12:59.917 --> 13:02.458
but in a word, yes.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.792
I knew she was a freak,
man. You can see it
in her eyes--

13:05.792 --> 13:08.250
You should take a picture.
It'll last longer.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.500
Great joke.
It's just shocking
to see you alone.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.708
Well, I'm not alone.
I'm sitting here conversing

13:13.708 --> 13:15.708
with my friend
and subordinate.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.583
Dayshaun doesn't count.
I'm talking about
your little friend Amanda.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.291
What's the deal?
Are you guys officially
dating, or what is it?

13:21.291 --> 13:23.583
Look, don't do this, all right?
Don't embarrass yourself.

13:23.583 --> 13:27.041
Oh, okay, I get it.
You can openly date her,

13:27.041 --> 13:29.125
but what was I? I was,
like, your secret shame?

13:29.125 --> 13:30.792
It's apples and oranges, baby.

13:30.792 --> 13:33.250
I mean, you know
she's just dating you
to get back at Bill, right?

13:33.250 --> 13:34.875
Bullshit.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.792
Are you blind, Gamby?

13:36.792 --> 13:39.583
They were fucking
and he broke up with her

13:39.583 --> 13:41.166
because she
was no good at it,

13:41.166 --> 13:43.667
and so she started dating you
to piss him off.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.959
Bill Hayden
fucked my girlfriend?

13:48.959 --> 13:50.708
Yeah.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.917
The greatest rivalry
in American history

13:55.917 --> 13:59.708
has to be between
Alexander Hamilton,
former treasure secretary,

13:59.708 --> 14:01.875
and Vice President
Aaron Burr. Okay?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.583
Mr. Gamby, can I-- What?

14:10.834 --> 14:13.458
Hmm.
Hey.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.583
Ooh. What does
that face mean?

14:15.583 --> 14:18.041
Bill Hayden, right now.
What's the history?

14:18.041 --> 14:22.041
Uh...
(whispering) Get
the fuck out of here.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.708
What the fuck
are you talking about, Neal?

14:23.708 --> 14:25.333
I don't like how
you're coming at me right now.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.583
You know
what I'm talking about.

14:26.583 --> 14:27.959
Did you or did you not
make love to him?

14:27.959 --> 14:29.375
Were you not lovers
with Bill Hayden?

14:29.375 --> 14:32.583
Uh, are you asking if
me and Bill Hayden fucked?

14:32.583 --> 14:35.375
Because, yeah, we did.
Is that what you wanted
to know?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.542
Yes, it's what I wanted to know,
but I didn't want you to be
all cavalier about it.

14:38.542 --> 14:41.000
Is this what you do?
You just mess around
with different people,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.875
just to get off
on your jollies?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.625
No. I slept with Bill.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.333
I didn't quiz you
about your history.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.166
I mean, I'm sure
you've had sex before, huh?

14:48.166 --> 14:50.041
I mean, clearly anybody
who's good at sex

14:50.041 --> 14:52.291
has sex with different people
and has a history.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.625
So don't be acting like
you're the only person
who's fucked people.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.417
I let Jen Abbott
suck my dick.
What?

14:56.417 --> 14:58.250
Yeah, in the supply closet,
so we're the same.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.166
This is not
how you communicate
with people, Neal.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.291
What are you, 12?
You can fuck Bill Hayden,

15:02.291 --> 15:03.875
but I can't let Jen Abbott
suck upon my penis?

15:03.875 --> 15:06.291
Not that we were
having this conversation,
but it's disgusting.

15:06.291 --> 15:07.750
I don't even want
to look at you right now.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.708
Well, fine. I don't want to look
at you right now either.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.458
So I'll just see you tonight
at the Winter Concert.

15:11.458 --> 15:14.125
I'll come pick you up.
How about we do
our own thing tonight, okay?

15:14.125 --> 15:16.041
I think we need some time
to cool off.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.792
Are you dumping me?
Jesus!

15:17.792 --> 15:19.667
Grow up, Neal,
and stop acting insane.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.542
Fuck.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.834
Mr. Gamby,
have you put any thought
into what we discussed?

15:32.834 --> 15:35.125
I thought about it,
but I haven't decided yet.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.834
Remember, Gamby,
Chief Accountability Officer

15:37.834 --> 15:41.834
doesn't have to wear
orange vests
or direct bus traffic.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.542
(clicking)

15:55.667 --> 15:58.041
Lee, why don't you help
Mi-Cha with the dishes?

15:58.041 --> 15:59.542
She looks overwhelmed.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.291
Play with your toy later.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.375
This is my work, Christine!

16:03.375 --> 16:06.291
(sighs)

16:06.291 --> 16:07.959
Fuck it! Fine!

16:07.959 --> 16:10.000
Doesn't she know
we have a dishwasher?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.583
Move! Caw! Caw! Caw!

16:12.583 --> 16:14.542
What is up with you?

16:14.542 --> 16:18.834
You've been so on edge lately,
sitting around, gaining weight

16:18.834 --> 16:20.708
and barking at people.

16:20.708 --> 16:22.041
Gaining weight?

16:22.041 --> 16:25.291
If this is about
my mom moving in,
I know it's been tough,

16:25.291 --> 16:27.333
but I need you
to make more of an effort.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.708
This is not about
your mom, Christine.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.500
This is about me,
being a man,

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
getting the goddamn respect
that I deserve.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.583
I have been pulling
double shifts at the hospital,

16:36.583 --> 16:39.041
and I can't handle
all of this by myself.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.542
I need you to step up.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.250
So I guess my job
means nothing.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.667
(shouting in Korean)

16:44.667 --> 16:47.250
I'll bet you'd
both be real sorry
if I killed myself,

16:47.250 --> 16:48.375
wouldn't you? Huh?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.000
Why are you saying that?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.375
No reason.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.333
(doorbell ringing)

16:57.333 --> 16:59.708
Move. Move!

17:01.625 --> 17:04.250
Gamby?
What are you doing here?

17:04.250 --> 17:06.291
Can we talk?

17:08.083 --> 17:12.375
Hey, go say goodbye
to your mom. Go on.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.000
Mama, you still mad?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.041
We won't go
if you still mad.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.875
Just answer the phone
when I call, that's all I ask.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.333
You're not gonna cry
or nothin'?

17:21.333 --> 17:23.750
There ain't nothing
to cry about.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.208
Look, I love y'all.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.708
But if you don't want
to be with me,

17:27.708 --> 17:29.917
I don't want to be
with you either.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.291
Come on, hug your mama.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.750
Go.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.125
♪ ♪

17:44.041 --> 17:46.917
I did not think it was possible
for you to fuck this family up

17:46.917 --> 17:48.291
more than you already have.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.458
This ain't about me.
It's about them.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.750
You're a low-down
son of a bitch.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.792
You know what?
That's all right.

17:54.792 --> 17:57.583
I ain't mad at you.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.041
(door handle clicking)
(boys laughing)

18:02.041 --> 18:04.542
Ha! That's funny, right?

18:04.542 --> 18:07.333
Hey, open this door,
Goddamn it.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.667
Y'all think this shit funny?
All right.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.250
Open the door! Shit!

18:11.250 --> 18:12.917
Snodgrass broke up
with me.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.834
Or maybe I broke up
with her,

18:14.834 --> 18:16.667
or maybe this is
just our first fight.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.792
I don't even know.
It got so fucking confusing
in those final moments.

18:19.792 --> 18:22.000
Is it because of the whole
Bill Hayden thing?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.917
You knew about that?

18:23.917 --> 18:25.750
Everybody knew about that.
It's common knowledge.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.291
Common knowledge?
I didn't know about it.

18:27.291 --> 18:28.750
I'm sitting there
getting played

18:28.750 --> 18:30.125
and you didn't
even tell me?

18:30.125 --> 18:31.917
You had me walking around
like I was hot shit

18:31.917 --> 18:34.333
and meanwhile, I'm getting
Bill Hayden's sloppy seconds.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.208
Are you really going
to make a big deal out of this?

18:36.208 --> 18:38.583
You know what? Fuck you!
I came over here

18:38.583 --> 18:40.834
because I have
a very important decision
to make,

18:40.834 --> 18:42.959
and you've just made it
a lot easier.

18:42.959 --> 18:44.250
Oh, what's that supposed
to mean?

18:44.250 --> 18:45.750
You're supposed
to have my back.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.542
I thought you were
my fucking friend.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.959
Gamby, don't go.

18:50.959 --> 18:53.750
I didn't think
to tell you because...

18:53.750 --> 18:55.458
because
I'm a self-absorbed person

18:55.458 --> 18:57.417
who doesn't think
about other people.

18:57.417 --> 18:59.834
I've never had to be loyal
to someone before.

18:59.834 --> 19:04.417
But you're right.
You've always been a man
of your word with me.

19:04.417 --> 19:08.708
And I should have told you
that your pussy was being
tampered with, Gamby.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.917
I should have been
more honest with you.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.375
I'm sorry.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.959
(whispers)
Damn it.

19:23.959 --> 19:25.417
Well...

19:25.417 --> 19:27.708
I appreciate
your telling me that.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.959
(sighs)

19:31.959 --> 19:36.625
The truth is that
I haven't been 100%
honest with you, Russell.

19:36.625 --> 19:40.792
Yesterday, Belinda offered me
to be her second in command

19:40.792 --> 19:44.917
with a brand-new title--
Chief Accountability Officer.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.083
What about me?

19:48.125 --> 19:51.166
Russell, she's going
to fire you.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.250
What did you tell her?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.166
I didn't say anything.
You know.

19:55.166 --> 19:59.875
I'll admit, in the moment,
I was definitely tempted.

19:59.875 --> 20:02.750
Now that I see
that our friendship
does mean something to you,

20:02.750 --> 20:05.875
it's simple.
The answer is no.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.708
Fuck it.

20:10.708 --> 20:14.083
Gamby, maybe you should
just take her up on it.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.291
Honestly, I'm...
I'm of no use to you.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.625
We gave it a good run...

20:20.583 --> 20:23.166
but our mission failed.

20:23.166 --> 20:26.291
The bitch won, Gamby.

20:28.417 --> 20:31.000
The bitch hasn't won.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.750
Not yet.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.625
Let's finish what we started.

20:40.792 --> 20:45.166
(school orchestra playing
"The Little Drummer Boy")

20:49.458 --> 20:51.625
Wait here.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.500
(orchestra continuing)

21:17.041 --> 21:19.208
(whispering)
What's up with you?
What the...?

21:19.208 --> 21:20.458
Why you creepin'?

21:20.458 --> 21:23.875
I was trying to be respectful
of the performance.

21:23.875 --> 21:27.625
♪ ♪

21:30.417 --> 21:32.166
Do you want to say something?

21:34.208 --> 21:36.333
Yeah. I was just gonna...

21:36.333 --> 21:39.375
talk to you about the offer
that you made me earlier.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.375
I didn't know if maybe
after this you wanted to go

21:41.375 --> 21:45.041
and... grab a bite
or something,
talk about it?

21:45.041 --> 21:47.000
Hmm.
My treat.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.500
(music ends)

21:48.500 --> 21:50.750
(applause)

21:57.291 --> 21:59.333
(lilvely chattering)

21:59.333 --> 22:02.041
Well, here we go.
To Brown and Gamby,

22:02.041 --> 22:03.917
partners in leadership.

22:03.917 --> 22:08.166
It sucks for Mr. Russell,
but, oh, well.

22:10.208 --> 22:11.583
I don't drink.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.250
Not even on
a special occasion?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.333
(sighs heavily)

22:15.333 --> 22:17.834
They're gone, Mr. Gamby.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.750
Who's gone?

22:19.750 --> 22:20.917
My babies.

22:20.917 --> 22:24.792
I was willing to do
whatever it took
to beat that man.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.250
I mean, I moved my boys
away from their home

22:27.250 --> 22:29.375
and their school,
their friends.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.208
I even had them living
in a hotel

22:31.208 --> 22:32.667
so he wouldn't have them.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.583
But now look--
they gone

22:35.583 --> 22:37.875
and I'm all alone.

22:39.208 --> 22:41.458
And I deserve
every bit of it.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.208
(sobbing)

22:43.208 --> 22:46.583
It's okay. Now, come on.
There, there. Shh.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.917
I'm sorry.

22:48.917 --> 22:51.583
I'm crying
like a baby.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.959
Maybe I will
have that drink.

22:53.959 --> 22:55.417
I damn sure could use one.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.750
You know what? Actually,
there is gin in this,

22:57.750 --> 23:00.625
so maybe I should get you
something else to drink.
How about that?

23:00.625 --> 23:03.834
Oh, no, if it got gin in it,
give it to me.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.417
Mmm!
It's a double, so...

23:10.417 --> 23:11.834
Ooh, yeah.

23:11.834 --> 23:14.750
That's gin, all right. Mmm!

23:16.959 --> 23:18.625
Okay.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.667
Wow, you're pretty thirsty.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.125
Ooh... Whoo!

23:24.125 --> 23:26.458
Sweet baby Jesus.
(chuckles)

23:26.458 --> 23:28.625
That brings back
a flood of memories.

23:28.625 --> 23:31.708
Ooh, Lord!
I'm gonna go get a refill.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.125
You want some?
No, no, I'm fine.

23:33.125 --> 23:35.583
I don't need anymore.
Whoo!

23:36.667 --> 23:39.000
Let me get a shot
of Tanqueray.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.542
All right. Whoo!

23:43.834 --> 23:46.333
Whoo! Shit!

23:46.333 --> 23:49.834
Ah!
Come on, come on!

23:49.834 --> 23:52.166
Preachy-ass bartender.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.250
Punch the smug motherfucker
in his face.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.542
Maybe we should just
slow this down a little bit.

23:56.542 --> 23:59.500
Big day at work tomorrow,
so don't want to...

23:59.500 --> 24:01.333
Mmm!

24:01.333 --> 24:02.542
What are you doing?

24:02.542 --> 24:05.458
I gotta get up here...
(mutters)

24:05.458 --> 24:06.959
Give me one of them smokes.

24:06.959 --> 24:08.542
Little draft there.

24:08.542 --> 24:10.000
Gamby, did you
just touch my ass?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.625
No, it's just the skirt
was hanging--

24:11.625 --> 24:15.417
Mr. Gamby, I didn't know
you liked coffee in your cream.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.125
(cackles)

24:18.667 --> 24:22.041
Bet you $20 I could eat
a pool ball like an apple.

24:22.041 --> 24:25.208
What?
(growling, laughing)

24:25.208 --> 24:27.458
I'm invincible, bitch!

24:27.458 --> 24:30.333
(laughing)

24:30.333 --> 24:31.917
Mmm!

24:33.083 --> 24:35.208
(crying)
It's okay, it's okay.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.375
Got my dancin' shoes.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.875
♪ Oh, I wanna dance
with somebody ♪

24:39.875 --> 24:44.708
♪ I wanna feel the heat

24:44.708 --> 24:46.542
Damn!

24:48.291 --> 24:50.583

24:50.583 --> 24:53.250
It's like Spin magazine...
(laughing) Motherfucker.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.458
Whoo!
I think we should probably
settle up the tab.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.125
I think
you've had enough tonight.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.542
No, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

24:58.542 --> 25:03.625
When I get back,
shit gonna get real,
Mr. Gamby.

25:06.667 --> 25:10.500
Whoo! Goddamn!
I got to piss!

25:10.500 --> 25:11.667
Shit.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.250
(cell phone ringing)
Anything good?

25:14.250 --> 25:17.166
Russell, I need your help.
Why? What's going on?

25:17.166 --> 25:18.750
We've uncorked a monster,
Russell.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.125
No! What in the hell
are you doing?

25:20.125 --> 25:21.583
I'm trying to suck
your dick, faggot!

25:21.583 --> 25:23.792
I'm not a faggot!
Oh, shit.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.583
We're coming your way,
Russell.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.166
Damn it!
Get your hands--

25:28.166 --> 25:29.834

off of me!

25:29.834 --> 25:31.166
Fuck you,

25:31.166 --> 25:32.875
I don't give a damn
how big you are!

25:32.875 --> 25:34.458
We're going, we're going--
Fuck you!

25:34.458 --> 25:36.250
Fuck you,

25:36.250 --> 25:37.708
Here's your jacket.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.208
What the fuck
you lookin' at?

25:39.208 --> 25:40.667
She's gotten
some bad news today.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.500
You ain't got to make
no goddamn excuses for me.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.083
Shit, I don't owe them
nothin'!

25:44.083 --> 25:46.125
What the fuck is going on
around here?

25:46.125 --> 25:48.667
Oh! Whew!

25:48.667 --> 25:50.792
Goddamn.

25:50.792 --> 25:54.125
Oh, motherfucker
bitch ass.

25:54.125 --> 25:55.917
Is that you?
No, no, it's not me.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.750
No, I'm a ghost.
I'm not here.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.542
Ooh, I'm not--
I'm not even here.

25:59.542 --> 26:00.959
I want to dance.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.500
I feel like dancing
tonight!

26:02.500 --> 26:04.458
Come on, y'all!
Yeah!

26:04.458 --> 26:07.375
Let's get this crunk
up in here!

26:07.375 --> 26:09.000
Get it all up in!
Yeah!

26:09.000 --> 26:10.750
Get it all up--
Hey, you thirsty, baby?

26:10.750 --> 26:12.458
Yeah. Goddamn.
Here you go.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.667
OM-fucking-G.

26:13.667 --> 26:14.917
What the fuck

26:14.917 --> 26:16.291
She is fucking wasted.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.917
Get the footage.

26:17.917 --> 26:20.250
This ain't even Tanqueray,
but shit, this'll do it.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.542
Goddamn!

26:21.542 --> 26:23.750
Oh, yeah, baby.
Yeah!

26:23.750 --> 26:25.500
Get down.
Bounce it, baby.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.667
What the fuck y'all

26:26.667 --> 26:29.166
Keep walkin'!
Keep walkin'.

26:29.166 --> 26:32.834
Is this real?
What-- is this a weave
or what is this?

26:32.834 --> 26:36.166
This is a cold-ass weave.
Bitch!

26:36.166 --> 26:39.959
Don't side-eye me.
I will fuck your man.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.333
She'll fuck his man.

26:41.333 --> 26:46.875
Let's turn
this motherfucker out!

26:46.875 --> 26:49.166
(laughs)
Don't be scared.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.500
You like it.
I see you.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.959
She just freaked you.
She freaked him.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.333
I been drinkin'!
I been smokin'!

26:55.333 --> 26:57.667
Yeah, yeah, go down.
Go-- go down low. Get low.

26:57.667 --> 27:02.291
Russell, Russell!
Don't do that. Don't do that.

27:02.291 --> 27:04.667
Hey, hey, Belinda?
Hey, look at this.

27:04.667 --> 27:06.500
You know what's going on?
What's wrong over here?

27:06.500 --> 27:10.208
There is something wrong
with this police car, B.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.834
Oh my God,
I don't feel any pee on it.

27:11.834 --> 27:13.375
Russell!
You gotta pee on this.

27:13.375 --> 27:16.041
Oh, right.
Fuck the po-po.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.542
Fuck you!

27:17.542 --> 27:21.250

27:21.250 --> 27:24.166

27:38.959 --> 27:41.000
You're awesome.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.375

Russell, help her. Help her.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.125
(both grunting)

27:51.125 --> 27:54.041

drink gin.
