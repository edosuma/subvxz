RAJESH:
Mm.

00:06.456 --> 00:07.753
Gentlemen, I put it to you:

00:07.924 --> 00:09.221
The worst tapioca pudding...

00:09.392 --> 00:13.226
...is better than the best pudding
of any other flavor.

00:13.997 --> 00:17.865
First off, that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.

00:18.968 --> 00:23.302
Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

00:23.473 --> 00:27.933
- It is extracted from the plant--
- Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

00:28.378 --> 00:30.175
Oh, no kidding.

00:30.346 --> 00:32.974
- A Fu Manchu, a handlebar, pencil?
- It's extracted from--

00:33.149 --> 00:36.016
I'm not sure yet.
You know, George Clooney has one now.

00:36.186 --> 00:38.347
Really? I once saw him
shopping at Ralphs.

00:38.521 --> 00:39.852
He was buying tequila.

00:40.457 --> 00:44.553
Wow, you'd think a guy like that
would have some kind of booze lackey.

00:48.498 --> 00:49.658
All right, this is cruel.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.461
We better let him finish
before his head explodes.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.466
All right. Sheldon, why is tapioca--?

00:54.637 --> 00:57.197
Tapioca is extracted
from the root of <i>Manihot esculenta.</i>

00:57.373 --> 00:59.273
Due to a high concentration of cyanide...

00:59.442 --> 01:02.639
...it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly.

01:05.248 --> 01:06.715
Feel better now?

01:06.883 --> 01:10.444
It's indigenous to Brazil, as is the cocoa
bean from which we get chocolate.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.020
You promised
you wouldn't do that anymore.

01:14.424 --> 01:17.518
- [LISPS] Hey, Hofstadter.
- Hey, Kripke.

01:17.694 --> 01:19.821

decay experiment.

01:19.996 --> 01:23.159
Twenty thousand data runs
and no statistically significant results.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.494
Very impressive.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.660
What a jerk.

01:28.838 --> 01:32.103
Don't feel bad, Leonard.
Negative results are still results.

01:32.275 --> 01:35.176
- Even 20,000 of them.
LEONARD: All right.

01:36.446 --> 01:38.380
Please don't cheer me up anymore.

01:38.548 --> 01:40.846
Come on, don't let him get to you.
It's Kripke.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.508
Yeah, he's a ginormous knob.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.782
That's why he eats by himself
instead of sitting here at the cool table.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.384
For shizzle.

01:53.563 --> 01:57.556
Hey, it's true, Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.

01:58.902 --> 02:01.166
But he controls
the new Open Science Grid computer...

02:01.337 --> 02:05.137
...that I need to run simulations
of structure formation in the early universe.

02:05.308 --> 02:09.038
Good luck getting time on it. The only
people he lets use it are his friends.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.339
Well, then, the solution is simple.

02:11.514 --> 02:13.448
I shall befriend him.

Kripke.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.315
Yeah?

02:17.487 --> 02:20.718
What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.255
I would say...

02:22.425 --> 02:25.326
...I have no interest
in becoming your friend.

02:25.795 --> 02:28.992
Really?
Oh, that seems rather shortsighted...

02:29.165 --> 02:32.293
...coming from someone
who is considered altogether unlikable.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.935

Barry, it was pleasant seeing you today
in the cafeteria.

03:40.536 --> 03:43.505
I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.

03:43.673 --> 03:46.107
Apparently, you did not know
that the chef's salad...

03:46.276 --> 03:49.575
...is kitchen trickery
to utilize scrap meat.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.608
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.

03:53.783 --> 03:56.149

04:17.807 --> 04:19.707
Well, how did you guys become friends?

04:19.875 --> 04:22.868
There was a flyer on the bulletin board

"Roommate wanted.

04:27.317 --> 04:28.477
And you moved in anyway?

04:28.651 --> 04:30.312
I assumed he was joking.

04:30.486 --> 04:34.889
You'd be surprised how many
particle physicists have a whimsical side.

04:35.058 --> 04:38.084
What about Howard and Raj?
How did he become friends with them?

04:38.261 --> 04:41.094
I don't know. How do carbon atoms
form a benzene ring?

04:41.264 --> 04:43.528

Hi.

05:14.864 --> 05:17.389
- What is this?
- It's a questionnaire I devised.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.434
I'm having some difficulty bonding
with a colleague at work...

05:20.603 --> 05:25.006
...so I'm doing a little research to better
understand why my current friends like me.

05:26.109 --> 05:29.101
Yes, well, that is a good question.

05:29.278 --> 05:31.803
But is this really the best way
to figure it out?

05:31.981 --> 05:33.175
I agree.

05:33.349 --> 05:35.146
The social sciences are largely hokum.

05:35.318 --> 05:38.981
But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response...

05:39.155 --> 05:42.249
...to my companionship,
this is the best I can do.

with a fairly obvious one.

a thought-provoking hypothesis.

to be a distended scrotum.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.805
It's kind of cute.

- Uh, till you get to the scrotum.
- Yeah.

...as a purely intellectual exercise.

08:08.804 --> 08:10.738
What do you mean?

in going in the water.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.621

It occurred to me you hadn't returned
any of my calls...

for pursuing our friendship.
