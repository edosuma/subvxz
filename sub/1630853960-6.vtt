00:11.011 --> 00:12.637
-<i>Batizek.</i>
-This is y'all's?

00:12.721 --> 00:15.098
<i>Batizek.</i>
-This is what Mexicans do? <i>Batizek.</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:16.808
-But look at my face.
-Yeah.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.481
-We go, <i>"Batizek."</i> A little pop.
-<i>Batizek. </i>I knew that. <i>Batizek.</i>

00:23.565 --> 00:25.734
Or you can do it like this,
a little wiggle.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.360
-Wiggle? You wiggle it?
-Yeah.

00:27.444 --> 00:31.239
-You wiggle it like, "All up in your ass."
-You do a lot of butt stuff.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.076
-There's also "Lick my ass."
-"Lick my ass?"

00:35.160 --> 00:37.662
It means, "Lick your ass."
"Lick my ass."

00:37.746 --> 00:39.539
-Lick your ass?
-Lick your ass.

00:39.622 --> 00:43.168
-Lick your ass right now?
No, no, no. No. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:43.251 --> 00:46.004
-I'll get your ass.
-I'll get your fat…

00:47.464 --> 00:50.216
Ah! Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it. I peed myself.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.551
-A little bit.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.678
No, no. Stop playing.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.725
<i>-Batizek!</i>
-Hello? Stop playing with my ass!

00:58.808 --> 01:01.728
<i>My ass? No, boy, it's your ass.</i>

01:01.811 --> 01:02.854
Oh.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.023
No, I was…Not you, bro.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.485
-<i>It's collection day.</i>
-Yeah, I'm about to step out now.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.694
<i>You got an hour.</i>

01:09.778 --> 01:12.405
<i>-Can't be late to Hameed's wedding.</i>
-Right.

01:15.784 --> 01:16.910
What's the matter?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.995
Nothing, it's just Hameed.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.500
He's freaking out about his fake wedding.
Being a real bridezilla.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.335
His wedding. It's all crazy.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.964
-You being straight with me?
-Yeah, what the hell? I'm fine. Come on.

01:32.842 --> 01:36.346
Don't know, it's just this feeling.
Like I used to get with my dad.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.185
-Just forget it. I'm just being paranoid.
-Yeah.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.899
-I'm gonna go for your <i>culito</i>. No, your--
-Oh, no. I'll get you-- I'm gonna get you.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.042
-DJ Khaled!
-Another one!

02:06.126 --> 02:09.212
You gonna have some
of this chicken cone shit?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.714
I don't know. Maybe.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.009
Oh, this shit's good.
But you know what keeps me coming back?

02:15.093 --> 02:15.927
Hm.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.387
The staff.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.890
They're conscientious as fuck.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.268
They told me about this cinna-maple shit.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.061
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:25.895 --> 02:27.063
Hm.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.274
They fired my favorite employee, though.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.278
Thinking maybe I should send him
a gift basket or something.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.823
-I know where he lives.
-Dante--

02:36.906 --> 02:37.907
Where's my money?

02:40.368 --> 02:41.536
Here.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.173
What is he, a jack-in-the-box gangster?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.341
I know it's light.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.761
-Selling merch is my side hustle.
-Bet.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.348
For real, man.
Look, I have a day job picking olives.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.100
You think I like doing that?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.936
I'm a refugee picking olives
with a bunch of immigrants.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.023
I mean, I'm not like, "OG" OG refugee.
I didn't float over here.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.984
I'm a privileged refugee,
but still all fucked up.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.987
Just give me some time,
and I'll get you all squared away, okay?

03:16.070 --> 03:18.948
Stay away from that chicken cone spot,
it's bad for your gut.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.534
Motherfucker, we're both wearing
tall tees to the pool.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.913
-You all the time, me sometimes.
-I bet your dives look like belly flops.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.415
-You sink to the bottom.
-You float to the top.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.751
-You look like you ate a linebacker.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.295
You look like a Dominican panda.

03:34.964 --> 03:38.051
-You'll pick up a package for me today.
-What package? What's in it?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.802
You're asking too many questions.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.554
Go when I text you…

03:42.055 --> 03:43.556
and be quick.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.644
-It's a tight window.
-When I do this, it's over.

03:48.311 --> 03:52.523
You're not making threats about my family.
Keep my brother, my mom, all out of this.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.569
Just check your brake lights, man.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.072
You cannot be caught with this shit.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.991
Say, man, can I get a confirmation?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.576
Dante, is that a yes?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.787
It's mad ambiguous, bro.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.666
Fuck.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.545
.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.006
-What's good?
-What's up, bro?

04:17.590 --> 04:20.051
-Why are you moving like that?
-What?

04:20.134 --> 04:22.220
Looks like it's a diarrhea day
or something.

04:22.303 --> 04:25.682
What's this thing about diarrhea?
Been talking to Sameer?

04:25.765 --> 04:29.143
No, I'm just saying you look tight.
Like your cheeks are clenched.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.687
I take two a day.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.189
You never hear that.
Most go once in the morning.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.984
I'm once and before I sleep.
Nobody cycles better than me.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.610
All right. Relax.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.488
I just had some immigration,
asylee shit anyway.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.240
Where's shee foo at?

04:43.032 --> 04:46.911
He's in there trying on his fifth suit.
He's gotta look perfect for his bride.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.957
-Still pretending this is a real marriage?
-We're not pretending. It's real.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.003
Especially if he wants his green card.
Immigration will be wanting photos.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.796
Hey! This is real, man!

04:57.297 --> 05:01.009
-Not real, stop bullshitting!
-Don't be a dick.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.052
Yeah, you love her? Swear to God.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.014
What the hell is this, bro?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.891
Oh, shit.
You look like Arab Katt Williams.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.644
Cat? What cat? Cat in suit?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.980
Don't listen to him.
Terrific choice.

05:14.063 --> 05:14.897
I look good.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.150
-Very refined, handsome.
-Very good.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.361
Aba, are you trying
to cash in your worst suit?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.446
Whoa.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.115
Anything for a dollar, you guys.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.826
"You guys"?
I don't like the antisemitic implication.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.578
It's not antisemitic. I'm Semitic.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.456
How can I be anti-me?
Excuse me, what is that?

05:31.539 --> 05:34.876
Don't touch! He loves it.
Why do you have to ruin his big day?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.294
Disaster. Polyester.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.671
Egyptian polyester, 1,000 thread count.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.131
-What?
-Come on.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.550
-What is that?
-Why would you ruin my big sale?

05:42.633 --> 05:43.718
Ah, Hameed.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.136
My brothers.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.390
You know, guys? This life is crazy
and full of surprises.

05:50.308 --> 05:55.772
When I came to America,
I was alone, didn't know a soul.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.151
But today is my wedding,
and I have my two brothers with me.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.403
My brothers, you understand?

06:02.487 --> 06:05.114
Hell yeah.
I don't even need no translation.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.368
-Nigga, that sounds beautiful.
-Shee foo, man. Shee foo, man.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.995
You don't have to pretend.
The government's not watching.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
I am not a crook.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.957
I love Dallas, okay?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.918
This is real, bro. I love Dallas.

06:17.001 --> 06:21.714
-Love. L-O-V. You know? Love.
-L-O-V, yeah. It's real. Stop playing.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.759
Don't act like the government
ain't watching. They definitely watchin'.

06:24.842 --> 06:28.096
-I'm gonna head out, all right?
-Where the hell are you going?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.599
I got things to do. Gotta get the suit,
and I'll meet you at the wedding.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.644
It's my day. I'm gonna get a haircut,
then we're gonna do <i>Zaffa</i>.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.397
Yeah, come on.
You gotta roll with us to the <i>Zaffa</i>.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.901
-What do you know about Palestinian <i>Zaffa?</i>
-I'm a student of the culture, for real.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.904
Now, are you gonna honor tradition or not?

06:44.987 --> 06:49.033
Ah. Ah. Hey. Ah. Ah. Ha. Ha.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.743
-That ain't gettin' me, bro.
-Come on.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.837
Does Maria know you're out here
sipping drink like a bar baby?

07:01.337 --> 07:02.547
It's a painkiller, bro.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.007
Want me to tell her
every time I pop a Claritin too?

07:05.091 --> 07:08.553
Hey, bro, man,
wait until you see my wife, bro.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.013
She's a real-American blondie, you know?

07:11.597 --> 07:15.518
Bro, her hair is like gold, like the sun.
You look at her like this.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.980
-Beautiful mama. Huh?
-She's not a real blonde, <i>habibi</i>.

07:19.063 --> 07:22.316
-She's not a real blonde. Get over it.
-No, she's a blondie, bro.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.694
She's not.
You can tell by her roots.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.696
She is a blondie.
I told to you--

07:26.779 --> 07:29.407
Both of you. Hey. Shut the hell up.

07:29.490 --> 07:34.704
-I swear y'all been colonially infected.
-What do you mean, bro, "Colon infection"?

07:34.787 --> 07:38.082
Asshole? Talking about my asshole
on my wedding day? What's wrong with him?

07:38.166 --> 07:39.500
No, not your asshole.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.045
<i>Habibi</i>, colonially infected
means you've been brainwashed

07:43.129 --> 07:46.757
by Europeans to that think
blonde is the pinnacle of beauty.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.677
What's beautiful about your girl
got nothing to do with her hair.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.930
It's that she's willing to marry
a goofball who barely speaks English.

07:53.014 --> 07:57.643
-Ah, me. Shee foo, man.
-Yeah, shee foo. That's real love.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.936
Love as real as her hair.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.981
Look at her eyebrows.
They're not blonde. Shee foo.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.650
-Bro, why are you saying--
-It's a fake marriage. Shee foo.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.402
Her hair is brunette! Brunette, man!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.863
-What's wrong?
-Carpet doesn't match the drapes.

08:08.946 --> 08:13.117
-Hey! Settle down, no!
-No! I'll kill you, kill myself, bro!

08:13.201 --> 08:14.660
-It's real love.
-I'm joking!

08:14.744 --> 08:16.621
-I'm just joking.
-Not my Dallas!

08:16.704 --> 08:19.207
-Say, "Hameed loves Dallas"!
-Hameed loves Dallas.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.960
-And she's a real blondie!
-She's a real blonde. Like the sun.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.296
-He's always doing this!
-I feel you.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.965
This nigga's about to kill you.
Nigga, that's real love.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.008
Hell, I love Dallas.

08:29.091 --> 08:32.178
-What do you mean?
-Not like that. Just saying I love Dallas.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.514
-Bro, I love Dallas only!
-You love Dallas.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.016
Dallas, Hameed! That's it!

08:37.099 --> 08:40.061
-We all believe you. You love Dallas.
-We believe you. Dallas, a real blonde.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.026
Hi. How are you?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.571
Hello. I'm fine.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.867
Mo asked me to pick up his suit.
We're going to a wedding.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.119
You know Hameed from Kaan Ya Makaan?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.204
Your eyes.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.288
What's wrong?

09:00.456 --> 09:01.290
Nothing.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.417
They're puffy.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.211
I have a good cream for you.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.296
Can I get the suit?

09:09.799 --> 09:10.800
Come, come.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.387
I'll spray some rose water on them,
they will be fine.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.306
Deep breath.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.267
-There you go.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.353
Don't move.
This is gonna open up your pores.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.357
Come on, make me sexy
for my blondie, you know?

09:26.440 --> 09:28.651
Yeah, real natural blonde, like Eminem

09:29.235 --> 09:30.319
or Odell Beckham.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.863
-Hey. Come here.
-What? What did I say?

09:34.156 --> 09:35.575
-Sup?
-What's wrong with you?

09:35.658 --> 09:37.910
Nothing. Having a good time. Hanging out.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.538
Why do you keep trying
to piss Hameed off? You jealous?

09:40.621 --> 09:43.207
Jealous? Of Hameed? What for?

09:43.291 --> 09:44.500
He's about to get married.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.003
And you've been stringing
Maria along for the last two years.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.756
Comparing Hameed's bullshit marriage
with Maria and I? You're losing your mind.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.510
I'm not comparing anything. Just saying,
my man is handling his situation,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.596
and you're here, scared to make a move.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.472
It's different with me.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.891
I want it to be legit,
I want my family to be on board.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.228
Just getting a green card?
"Celebration, pictures," I want real shit.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.939
Shut the hell up.
This ain't that. This is real love.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.818
I think you're scared of what your mom
and your aunties at the mosque will say.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.571
You're acting
like a prepubescent 13-year-old.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.156
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.035
-Yay!
-The <i>Zaffa </i>is here. Yay!

10:19.118 --> 10:21.787
-Yay! Come on, it's a real <i>Zaffa!</i>
-Yay!

10:21.871 --> 10:23.664
Yay! Together!

11:06.749 --> 11:07.708
-High!
-High!

11:13.339 --> 11:14.715
-High!
-High!

11:26.102 --> 11:29.689
-Congratulations, Hameed!
Thank you!

11:29.772 --> 11:31.816
Congrats, <i>habibi</i>.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.528
-Gotta pick up my suit.
-I thought Maria was gonna get it.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.779
It's got an oil stain.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.824
-Gotta take it to the cleaners. Yeah.
-A stain on it?

11:41.075 --> 11:41.992
<i>Habibi</i>.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.371
<i>Habibi</i>, congratulations.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.403
Hello?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.114
Hello?

12:20.990 --> 12:21.824
Yo!

12:22.742 --> 12:23.576
Hello?

12:24.660 --> 12:25.661
Yo, anybody here?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.955
-Who the hell are you?
-Shit, bro!

12:28.622 --> 12:30.124
Um, Dante sent me.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.501
DJ Khaled-looking motherfucker?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.378
What are you, a fed?

12:34.462 --> 12:37.548
I'm not a fed, bro.
Government doesn't even recognize me.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.217
-So you're illegal?
-No, I'm, I'm in the system.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.763
-You were in the pen?
-No, immigration system.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.141
I never was in the penitentiary.
Though it feels like I'm serving time.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.560
-You do all this yourself?
-Yeah.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.687
Me and my team of little people.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.065
-For real?
-No, bitch! This ain't Willy Wonka.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.785
It was his father's suit.
We had it tailored for Mo.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.578
-Can I?
-Yes.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.707
It's beautiful.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.085
What did your mother say
when she first saw your tattoo?

13:17.338 --> 13:18.255
She was there.

13:19.673 --> 13:20.925
Um, she drove me.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.596
I have one thing for you.
Give me your hand, please.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.767
For the wedding.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.936
Very beautiful. Keep it this way.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.232
Thank you very much.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.734
You're welcome. Any time.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.280
You even know what's in here?

13:44.198 --> 13:48.244
-No, I don't wanna know.
-Oxycontin, Percocets, Xanax.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.873
-Name it. Like a piñata of pills.
-Fuck that shit! Why did you tell me? Why…

13:52.957 --> 13:56.794
Can't be mysterious like <i>Pulp Fiction</i>?
I'm not touching that shit.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.297
Look, Dante said if you don't take it,
he wanted me to tell you

14:00.381 --> 14:02.633
that he likes your mom's style of lamps.

14:05.636 --> 14:09.515
-I don't know what that means, but it's--
-Cold-blooded, man.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.102
Hey, I don't enjoy doing this
any more than you, okay?

14:13.185 --> 14:17.356
-You think I like owing Dante favors too?
-You don't ever bring mamas into this.

14:17.439 --> 14:21.026
-Even the mafia doesn't do that shit.
-Don't shoot the messenger.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.363
-Fuck!

14:24.446 --> 14:25.322
Shit.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.408
Pudgy motherfucker.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.285
-Hello? What?
<i>Where you at?</i>

14:29.368 --> 14:30.995
<i>Hameed needs to get to the venue ASAP.</i>

14:31.078 --> 14:33.163
-No, man.
-<i>Come on. We need a ride.</i>

14:33.247 --> 14:34.373
Drive your truck.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.542
<i>I don't have my truck. You drove.</i>

14:36.625 --> 14:39.211
-Look, I can't talk about it.
-<i>It's Hameed's wedding day.</i>

14:39.295 --> 14:43.173
<i>-You won't leave us stranded. Pick us up.</i>
-I can't pick you up. Don't hang up.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.928
Shit, shit, shit!

14:52.433 --> 14:56.645
-Why are you driving so slow?
-It's a '68 Torino. It's a classic.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.231
A lot of…

14:59.315 --> 15:00.482
potholes around here.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.110
Where the hell is your suit at?

15:03.694 --> 15:05.946
-Huh? My s--
-Your suit. Where's your suit?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.323
It's, oh, uh…

15:07.406 --> 15:10.242
Maria has it.
It was a false alarm, bro. We're good.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.870
Hameed, don't smoke, man!

15:12.953 --> 15:14.830
-Bro.
-Please, don't smoke.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.625
-Please, don't smoke weed in the car.
-It's my wedding day.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.835
-I wanna relax.
-What's wrong with you?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.670
Why you got all this weird energy?

15:22.296 --> 15:26.091
-Don't want him high for his wedding.
-Oh, relax. Okay, man.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.051
Shit!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
The motherfucking police, man.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.307
-Hey.
-Hey. What are you doing?

15:33.390 --> 15:36.685
-Gotta get this car back.
-It's a regular pop-up routine stop.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.603
Drive through.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.230
-What are you doing?
-I got drugs in the car.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.192
-Under two ounces is a misdemeanor. Drive.
-You don't get it.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.361
-I have hundreds of pills in the car!
-What?

15:45.444 --> 15:48.948
Yeah. Dante's making me run them.
They're in the trunk.

15:49.031 --> 15:53.118
-That's why you've been acting so weird?
-Man, relax. Take it easy, dear.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.831
-Give me the pills. I'll put it in my ass.
-It's hundreds of pills. It won't fit.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.293
You're acting like you had squeaky tires,
not a trunk full of drugs.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.254
I swear, that drink
is frying your brain cells.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.967
Bro, you forget you're Black.
Chill, man. Don't move, bro.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.929
They'll kill you.
You'll die for sure. Me or him, maybe.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.224
-We're all going to prison.
-Nobody's going to jail.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.518
Nobody's going to jail. Just be cool.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.105
Shit, man. Dog. There's a dog.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.664
Passport.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.594
Excuse me.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.223
-Gentlemen.
-How are you doing, sir?

16:56.306 --> 16:59.184
Doing great, thank you.
You don't mind popping the trunk?

17:01.311 --> 17:02.646
Jesus.

17:02.730 --> 17:03.605
What did you say?

17:03.689 --> 17:04.940
I was, uh…

17:06.817 --> 17:07.985
I said, uh…

17:09.111 --> 17:10.195
Saying praise Jesus.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.284
-Yes.
-Praise God, yes.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.997
Yeah, we were invited to Lakewood Church
by Pastor Osteen himself.

17:20.497 --> 17:25.085
I see. Well, I'm fond of Mr. Osteen.
What are you doing over at Lakewood?

17:25.669 --> 17:28.297
-Oh, we're in a gospel choir.
-International.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.216
Yeah, absolutely.
Showcasing the diversity of Houston.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.635
Diversity initiative.
I know that's one of his things.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.888
-Yeah, I got that email.
-Yeah.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.892
If you're gospel singers,
why don't you sing a few hymns for me?

17:40.392 --> 17:43.979
-Yeah, of course. We can do that. Do that.
-Oh, Yeah. Um…

17:44.563 --> 17:46.565
Uh…

17:52.905 --> 17:58.243
-Yeah.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.012
I say<i>.</i>

18:26.647 --> 18:29.191
-Not bad, gentlemen, not bad. Amen.
Yeah.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.947
-What's the deal with Smiles back there?
-Oh, he's converting.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.991
Yeah. A wayward sinner
just coming back to Christ.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.746
Like a sheep lost from the flock.
Never too late to be saved, brother.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.374
Yeah. Shee foo, man. Shee foo, yeah.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.211
Yo, just like in the Bible
in Matthew19.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.212
Yeah.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.841
Which says, "Therefore go
and make disciples of all nations."

18:53.924 --> 18:55.217
-Hold on a sec.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.929
Yeah. All right.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.933
-I won't get in the way of God's work.
-We're praying for you.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.519
-Absolutely.
-Get these boys out of here.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.645
Thank you.

19:09.982 --> 19:14.027
-How you doing? Praise be.
-God forgive me. Praise be. Yes.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.487
-Yes, God.
-Shit.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.158
-Fuck! Now give me Xanax for real.
-Shut the hell up, Hameed.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.586
There is the man!

19:34.506 --> 19:36.842
Great men, amazing!

19:44.600 --> 19:47.477
-Hamoodi, come on, <i>habibi!</i>

19:50.105 --> 19:50.981
Hi, baby.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.401
-Hi. This is incredible.
-Yeah.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.238
Oh, my God. It fits so well. It's perfect.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.033
What's going on?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.745
I can't stop thinking
about this fucking dog.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.290
Sniffing the left side of my car,
and it made eye contact with me.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.251
I make eye contact with it.
It's making more eye contact.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.295
I'm like, "My God, can it smell fear?"

20:13.378 --> 20:16.757
On the outside, I'm cool as a cucumber,
but inside, I'm already deported.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.508
Halfway to Palestine.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.969
-And she had a passport.
-Who?

20:21.053 --> 20:25.974
Hamoodi,
come on and dance, <i>habibi!</i>

20:26.058 --> 20:30.020
Something I've wanted my
whole life, they gave it to a fucking dog.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.940
Oh, baby, you're gonna get one too.
Come on, let's dance.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.484
Uh, let's get married.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.527
You're proposing to me?

20:37.611 --> 20:41.615
I know I'm the one that wanted to wait,
but I don't wanna live like this anymore.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.910
You wanna propose to me
because a dog has a passport?

20:44.993 --> 20:48.330
Damn the dog.
I wanna get married. That's the headline.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.666
Because before it was religion,
it was your mother.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.168
You know she gave me a bracelet
to cover my crucifix?

20:53.252 --> 20:56.255
No, I didn't know that. I don't care,
as long as you believe in God.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.591
I know this isn't how you pictured it,
and I didn't picture it this way either.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.386
It's just been a crazy fucking day.

21:02.469 --> 21:09.017
You guys did amazing! Great!
Come on, let's get to the church!

21:09.101 --> 21:09.935
Listen…

21:10.018 --> 21:12.896
-What's going on? Don't lie to me.
-I'm not lying to you.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.776
I have drugs in my car,
but they'll be gone by the end of the day.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.862
What? You have drugs in your car?
You're a drug dealer now?

21:20.946 --> 21:25.033
No, I'm not a drug dealer.
You know who I am. I would never do that.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.328
Although, I did have a run-in
with a real drug dealer,

21:28.412 --> 21:29.997
and then Chien popped in out of nowhere.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.209
I had to be there for him. He sewed me up.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.627
I'm not gonna leave him there.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.338
But it's all good because
he said if I deliver a package today…

21:41.049 --> 21:43.010
-It's all over--
-I knew you were lying!

21:43.093 --> 21:46.305
I knew it, and you were making me
feel like I was the one who was crazy.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.641
-I'm sorry. You're 100% right.
-No, no, no. What is this?

21:49.725 --> 21:50.642
The lean?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.856
-What are you talking about?
-You thought I didn't know?

21:55.939 --> 21:58.483
I'm fucking done with that shit.
It's over. I was wrong.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.820
-You're right about that.
-This is the same shit you do to your mom.

22:01.903 --> 22:05.073
I don't know why you feel
you have to protect us from the truth.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.744
I've done it all my life.
Ever since my dad died, it's been me.

22:08.827 --> 22:12.539
You keep thinking that you have to do all
this stuff alone, and you don't.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.625
And it's really taking a toll on me.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.796
I don't know what you're saying.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.215
You don't trust me?

22:26.470 --> 22:31.516
Two years together,
you're my baby girl, my world.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.310
-You don't trust me?
-No.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.734
No, I don't trust you.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.031
And I don't wanna marry you.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.451
I want a partner,

22:50.035 --> 22:53.497
not someone who lies,
and numbs himself to cope with it.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.874
I can't do this anymore.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.751
You can't do what? Maria.

23:00.003 --> 23:00.837
Maria.

23:12.265 --> 23:15.060
It's his wedding day. Are you serious?

23:15.143 --> 23:16.186
Maria!

23:17.729 --> 23:19.731
Hey, you coming in or what?

23:22.150 --> 23:23.110
Yeah.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.570
You too, Nazeer. Come on.

23:26.446 --> 23:30.075
Hey, Nazeer Santana.
Come the hell on, man.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.702
- Get your Palestinian John Mayer--
-Let's go.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.428
What the hell is wrong with you?

23:50.011 --> 23:52.556
-Don't wanna talk about it.
-Shee foo. Late, bro.

23:53.056 --> 23:53.890
Where's Maria?

23:54.474 --> 23:56.560
Uh, if you would all please stand.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.507
My wife! Hey.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.053
Father. <i>Baba</i>.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.557
-I love you.
-I love you, baby.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.685
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for being here today

24:38.768 --> 24:42.856
to help us celebrate the union
of these two beautiful children of God.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.445
The only thing left is the rings.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.655
Do you have the rings?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.157
-You did bring rings?
-Yes.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.408
-Yeah, sorry.
-Okay.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.993
Yeah. Very good.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.537
Wonderful. Uh…

24:58.205 --> 25:04.252
Well, with these rings,
and by the power vested in me

25:04.336 --> 25:06.254
by the great state of Texas,

25:07.088 --> 25:08.757
-I, uh…

25:09.341 --> 25:12.511
You may… You're already doing it,
so I won't bother with that.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.317
Hameed loves Dallas.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.360
Yeah!

25:30.153 --> 25:31.446
Shee foo.
