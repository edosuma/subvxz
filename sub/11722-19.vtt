the <i>"Secret Circle"...</i>

00:02.487 --> 00:03.687
Hi.
I'm Diana.

00:03.948 --> 00:05.471
Pete. Ship's captain.

00:05.497 --> 00:06.821
How big is your boat?

00:07.292 --> 00:08.243
Your boat?

00:08.244 --> 00:10.245
I might have exaggerated
my position

00:10.247 --> 00:12.747
in regards to the boat.
It's not mine.

00:12.749 --> 00:14.899
That's not an exaggeration,
it's a lie.

00:14.901 --> 00:16.868
So you do have magic.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.787
But I can't stop
all the witch hunters.

00:18.789 --> 00:19.954
The hunters are back?

00:19.956 --> 00:22.507
Yes, and they're going
to kill all of us.

00:22.509 --> 00:24.542
You're a witch.

00:24.544 --> 00:27.846
If I have as much power
as you think I do,

00:27.848 --> 00:29.664
do you really want
to test it?

00:30.800 --> 00:33.485
Each one of your
families has its own crystal.

00:33.487 --> 00:35.303
Bound together in
their original form,

00:35.305 --> 00:37.088
there is no
stronger magic.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.758
And there'll be enough to stop
Eben and the witch hunters?

00:39.760 --> 00:40.775
You're a circle.

00:40.777 --> 00:43.144
Together with the power
of 6 crystals,

00:43.146 --> 00:45.363
you can destroy them
once and for all.

00:48.985 --> 00:53.405
I can't believe I just
rifled my mom's underwear drawer.

00:53.407 --> 00:55.790
No one that old should have
that many thongs.

00:55.792 --> 00:57.208
The crystal's never
gonna be here.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.878
The elders were trying to keep
magic away from our parents.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.029
Well, my grandfather
is dead,

01:01.031 --> 01:02.780
and I guarantee
if he had a crystal,

01:02.782 --> 01:04.715
my mom found it.

01:04.718 --> 01:07.502
Ok. Let's say she had one and
was trying to hide it from you.

01:07.504 --> 01:10.138
What's the last thing
you'd ever do around here?

01:10.140 --> 01:11.256
Heh,
I don't know.

01:11.258 --> 01:13.791
Cook, clean.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.977
Bills?

01:28.491 --> 01:30.241
A journal?

01:30.243 --> 01:32.243
Tied with an actual
ribbon.

01:32.245 --> 01:33.278
Hey.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.163
You leave something
like this lying around,

01:35.165 --> 01:37.782
you're just begging
for it to be read.

01:37.784 --> 01:40.535
Doo-doo-doo-doo.

01:41.754 --> 01:45.123
"July 12, 1994.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.258
"I am deeply in love.

01:47.260 --> 01:50.678
"He says my presence
chases away the dark

01:50.680 --> 01:52.464
like the dawn
of every day."

01:52.466 --> 01:55.183
Ew. I have to stop.
I just ate.

01:55.185 --> 01:57.168
Your mom and dad
were in love.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.304
That's nice.

02:01.023 --> 02:03.441
I don't know about that.

02:06.011 --> 02:09.981
"I told John today that we
can't hide our relationship

02:09.983 --> 02:12.951
from Tom and Amelia
for much longer."

02:12.953 --> 02:14.986
Wait, Tom's
your dad, right?

02:14.988 --> 02:17.355
And Amelia was
Cassie's mom.

02:17.357 --> 02:18.656
Which means...

02:18.658 --> 02:24.078
My mom and John Blackwell
were secretly hooking up.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.426
You guys reading stories
to each other? How cute.

02:38.428 --> 02:42.063
Yeah, about witches being
massacred over the centuries.

02:42.065 --> 02:44.549
There's 200 years
just known as the burning times.

02:44.551 --> 02:46.484
Whole towns burned
at the stake.

02:46.486 --> 02:47.602
And that was before
the witch hunters

02:47.604 --> 02:49.154
had demons
helping them.

02:49.156 --> 02:51.906
That's why we need to find the
6 crystals and bring them together.

02:51.908 --> 02:54.492
It's the only weapon
powerful enough to defeat them.

02:54.494 --> 02:55.910
No crystal at my place.

02:55.912 --> 02:58.246
Then we just
have Cassie's.

02:58.248 --> 02:59.564
How does it work?

02:59.566 --> 03:01.916
My grandmother says
the crystal is a lens

03:01.918 --> 03:03.952
that magnifies
individual power.

03:03.954 --> 03:07.539
So I could destroy
this ugly vase all by myself?

03:07.541 --> 03:08.706
Let me try.

03:12.962 --> 03:14.429
Faye, drop
the crystal!

03:16.131 --> 03:18.883
Faye! Don't do
that again.

03:18.885 --> 03:21.186
This is not a toy.

03:21.188 --> 03:22.470
Its power
can be drained.

03:22.472 --> 03:24.722
So only use it
if you have to.

03:24.724 --> 03:26.024
Now, we need to get the rest
of the crystals

03:26.026 --> 03:28.059
from the elders before the witch
hunters attack.

03:28.061 --> 03:29.861
Wouldn't the elders want
to stop the witch hunters, too?

03:29.863 --> 03:31.613
Can't we just
ask them for help?

03:31.615 --> 03:32.831
The elders will
never trust you.

03:32.833 --> 03:33.931
After
the boatyard fire,

03:33.933 --> 03:35.266
they stripped your parents of
their magic.

03:35.268 --> 03:36.434
When they find out
you have it,

03:36.436 --> 03:38.903
they'll do the same
thing to you, too.

03:39.822 --> 03:42.056
I'm gonna drive out
to my granddad's.

03:42.058 --> 03:44.108
If my family has a crystal,
it'll be there.

03:44.110 --> 03:46.044
My grandparents are on the other
side of the country right now.

03:46.046 --> 03:47.045
My grandmother
disappeared

03:47.047 --> 03:49.063
after she tried
to kill Cassie.

03:49.065 --> 03:51.282
I'm sure I can find a way
into my grandmother's place

03:51.284 --> 03:52.667
and look around
pretty easily.

03:52.669 --> 03:54.452
Don't underestimate
the elders.

03:54.454 --> 03:57.071
Go in groups so you can use
your circle magic.

03:57.073 --> 03:58.973
Why don't you and I
help Melissa?

03:58.975 --> 04:03.044
I told Jake I'd go
with him.

04:03.046 --> 04:04.646
Well, I call shotgun.

04:04.648 --> 04:07.599
Unless you two were planning
a romantic daytrip.

04:07.601 --> 04:09.817
I can help
Melissa.

04:11.186 --> 04:12.470
Ok, let's go.

04:13.305 --> 04:14.305
Hey.

04:14.307 --> 04:17.692
Uh, my grandmother
called.

04:17.694 --> 04:19.761
She comes home
tomorrow.

04:19.762 --> 04:21.529
She does?

04:21.531 --> 04:24.582
I'm glad,
for both of you.

04:24.584 --> 04:27.485
Heh.

04:27.487 --> 04:29.954
Look, I know you two
were never best friends,

04:29.956 --> 04:34.325
but it would be nice
to see you two getting along.

04:35.461 --> 04:37.929
Well, you know, if I'm gonna
be staying here in town,

04:37.931 --> 04:41.332
there's a number of people
I need to reach out to,

04:41.334 --> 04:42.717
and she's definitely
one of them.

04:48.941 --> 04:50.224
Thank you.

05:01.853 --> 05:04.989
For you. For giving me
a second chance.

05:04.991 --> 05:06.741
You won't regret it.

05:06.743 --> 05:07.875
For the next
24 hours,

05:07.877 --> 05:09.611
you're gonna get all
truth all the time.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.614
And Pete's letting me borrow
the boat for the afternoon,

05:12.616 --> 05:14.332
so I'm gonna take
you to the San Juan islands

05:14.334 --> 05:16.634
for a sunset picnic.

05:16.636 --> 05:18.386
That sounds amazing.

05:18.388 --> 05:20.054
And I can't believe
I have to do this,

05:20.056 --> 05:22.140
but something came up

05:22.142 --> 05:24.826
and I was hoping we could
reschedule for tomorrow.

05:24.828 --> 05:27.462
Actually,
we're shipping out

05:27.464 --> 05:29.013
first thing in
the morning.

05:29.015 --> 05:31.566
I'm not sure when
we'll be back.

05:31.568 --> 05:33.318
Melissa, hi.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.153
I love the way
you say my name.

05:36.389 --> 05:38.189
And you're the guy
from the boathouse.

05:38.191 --> 05:40.158
- Adam.
- Grant.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.726
Can you excuse us
for a second?

05:41.728 --> 05:43.661
Sure.

05:46.665 --> 05:49.400
I just bailed on an insanely
romantic date he had planned,

05:49.402 --> 05:52.420
but can I at least
just have an hour?

05:52.422 --> 05:54.739
As soon as my grandmother
leaves the house,

05:54.741 --> 05:55.923
we have to be ready.

05:55.925 --> 05:58.710
It's our best shot
to find her crystal.

05:58.712 --> 06:00.545
But do we have to go
right now?

06:00.547 --> 06:03.848
Well, maybe we can pull it off
without the three of us.

06:05.551 --> 06:06.517
Really?

06:06.519 --> 06:08.803
So you don't need me
at all?

06:10.022 --> 06:11.139
Go.

06:11.141 --> 06:14.925
Thank you.

06:14.927 --> 06:16.361
Let's go picnicking.

06:16.363 --> 06:18.095
Well, good day, mate.

06:18.097 --> 06:20.815
That sounded Irish.

06:20.817 --> 06:22.900
Look, grab us
a couple coffees,

06:22.902 --> 06:25.703
I will meet you
up front.

06:30.409 --> 06:32.877
I emailed.
I called.

06:32.879 --> 06:35.246
And you haven't
heard from me.

06:35.248 --> 06:36.714
What does that
tell you?

06:36.716 --> 06:39.417
Sorry about the way
I acted at the party.

06:39.419 --> 06:41.586
Couldn't help myself.

06:41.588 --> 06:44.172
Come on, you're a witch.
You know how amazing that is?

06:44.174 --> 06:46.174
Yeah, actually,
I do.

06:46.176 --> 06:47.625
Why are you here?

06:47.627 --> 06:48.926
What do you care?

06:48.928 --> 06:49.960
It's ok, Jake.

06:49.962 --> 06:51.128
No, it's not.
He's a bottom feeder

06:51.130 --> 06:52.847
who just wants
our power.

06:54.633 --> 06:56.434
Our power?

06:56.436 --> 06:57.752
You mean he's a witch, too?

06:57.754 --> 07:00.154
Just leave us alone,
Callum.

07:00.156 --> 07:02.573
You know that I'd never
hurt you, all right.

07:02.575 --> 07:05.026
This Ken doll, I mean,
he's a different story, huh?

07:05.028 --> 07:06.689
You know how much a pint
of witch blood goes for

07:06.714 --> 07:07.914
on the black market?

07:09.198 --> 07:10.748
Stop it!

07:10.750 --> 07:11.916
Stop it!

07:11.918 --> 07:13.451
Let's just go.

07:28.217 --> 07:30.852
Hello?

07:33.906 --> 07:35.623
Grandma!

07:35.625 --> 07:38.276
Hi!

07:38.278 --> 07:39.677
Ha ha! What?

07:39.679 --> 07:42.530
I--I didn't expect you
until tomorrow.

07:42.532 --> 07:44.232
And I was gonna
clean the house

07:44.234 --> 07:47.735
and...buy you flowers,
put food in the fridge.

07:47.737 --> 07:49.403
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

07:49.405 --> 07:50.988
I should be taking care
of you.

07:50.990 --> 07:55.176
I managed ok.
And Mr. Meade was really great.

07:55.178 --> 07:59.130
And my father's back.

07:59.132 --> 08:03.985
We came to visit you
at the clinic. Remember?

08:03.987 --> 08:06.203
Yes, I do.

08:06.205 --> 08:07.755
Oh.

08:07.757 --> 08:11.208
Look, I know you two haven't
had the greatest history.

08:11.210 --> 08:14.028
A real father is someone
who raises you,

08:14.030 --> 08:16.013
looks after you,

08:16.015 --> 08:20.151
not someone who pretends
to be dead for 16 years.

08:20.153 --> 08:23.471
But people can change,
right?

08:23.473 --> 08:24.589
Look, don't get mad,

08:24.591 --> 08:27.909
but I asked him
to give you a call.

08:29.812 --> 08:31.579
All right.

08:31.581 --> 08:33.581
I will try to get
along with him.

08:33.582 --> 08:35.283
For you.

08:38.370 --> 08:40.837
That means everything to me.

08:42.692 --> 08:46.861
Oh, um, I have to go.

08:46.863 --> 08:48.179
I mean, I just--
I didn't know

08:48.181 --> 08:50.598
that you were gonna be home today
and I have this thing.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.300
Go. Have fun
with your friends.

08:53.368 --> 08:56.587
If your father calls,
I will invite him for coffee,

08:56.589 --> 08:58.723
see if we can't
play nice.

09:02.811 --> 09:05.313
I love you, grandma.

09:05.315 --> 09:07.715
Love you, too.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.955
Why is Faye
taking so long?

09:13.957 --> 09:17.241
Why did you tell Adam you were
already going with me

09:17.243 --> 09:19.193
when you weren't?

09:19.195 --> 09:21.963
It's just...

09:21.965 --> 09:24.799
Look, it's hard
being around him right now.

09:24.801 --> 09:26.250
Why hard?

09:26.252 --> 09:27.885
I thought the elixir
made you forget

09:27.887 --> 09:29.704
you ever had
feelings for him.

09:31.223 --> 09:33.841
It did.

09:33.843 --> 09:35.259
Hard's not the right word.

09:35.261 --> 09:39.430
It's just, uh, weird.

09:39.432 --> 09:41.065
Scootch over.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.800
About time.

09:42.802 --> 09:44.569
I was getting snacks.

09:44.571 --> 09:45.970
And you're welcome.

09:45.972 --> 09:48.856
Jake, I got you some jerky
'cause I love saying it.

09:48.858 --> 09:50.858
For you I got healthy,
boring, non-fat nut bars

09:50.860 --> 09:53.611
'cause you are
what you eat.

09:56.515 --> 10:00.001
Wow. Your grandmother's got
a lot of crystals.

10:00.003 --> 10:02.453
She used to spend
de winters in Sedona.

10:02.455 --> 10:04.989
They're really into
this stuff there.

10:04.991 --> 10:07.157
Obviously.

10:19.771 --> 10:22.139
My parents always
kept him away from us.

10:22.141 --> 10:23.891
They said
he was crazy.

10:28.563 --> 10:30.180
How about you knock?

10:30.182 --> 10:32.016
What a gentleman.

10:38.490 --> 10:40.691
Lock unlock?

10:45.131 --> 10:49.884
Crazy and paranoid.

10:53.505 --> 10:58.175
Wow. Just wow.

11:12.274 --> 11:14.608
I guess he's
getting worse.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.663
What the hell
is all this?

11:18.665 --> 11:23.034
It's a conspiracy wall.

11:24.569 --> 11:29.557
A hall of fame conspiracy wall
from Salem to Satan

11:29.559 --> 11:33.010
and a lot of weird crap
in between.

11:36.081 --> 11:39.583
Hey, guys. You need to take
a look at this.

11:39.585 --> 11:42.636
It's us.

11:49.231 --> 11:50.463
Why does he have
our birthdays?

11:51.052 --> 11:52.802
What does it all mean?

11:52.804 --> 11:55.722
That Jake's grandpa
is crazy.

11:55.724 --> 11:57.774
No offense.

11:57.776 --> 11:58.775
None taken.

11:58.777 --> 12:00.193
And that we have to
find the crystal

12:00.195 --> 12:02.312
and get out of here
before he comes back

12:02.314 --> 12:03.396
and kills us.

12:03.398 --> 12:05.848
Again, no offense.

12:15.810 --> 12:16.976
The last time
I saw him

12:16.978 --> 12:18.578
was when he crashed
my parents' funeral

12:18.580 --> 12:20.613
screaming about
the end of the world.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.082
My aunt said that
after they died

12:23.084 --> 12:24.700
he just completely
fell apart.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.420
Well, at least he's
kept himself busy.

12:27.422 --> 12:29.589
Let's just find
the crystal.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.932
Charles.

12:39.934 --> 12:41.401
Do you have a minute?

12:41.403 --> 12:43.736
No, I don't.

12:43.738 --> 12:45.988
I've been meaning
to come see you to explain.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.690
I came back to town
for my daughter.

12:47.692 --> 12:48.991
I just want to do
right by her.

12:48.993 --> 12:51.444
You've never done anything
for anyone but yourself.

12:51.446 --> 12:52.945
Where have you been,
John,

12:52.947 --> 12:54.530
while we were
picking up the pieces

12:54.532 --> 12:56.732
and dealing with the
consequences of your actions.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.867
That's unfair.

12:57.869 --> 13:00.069
I told you the witch hunters'
truce was a lie.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.921
You told us
we could beat them.

13:01.923 --> 13:03.206
We could have,

13:03.208 --> 13:04.573
if we stayed united.

13:04.575 --> 13:05.925
United?

13:05.927 --> 13:08.628
You summoned demons after we
all agreed it was too dangerous.

13:08.630 --> 13:09.796
You betrayed us.

13:09.798 --> 13:11.264
That was a mistake.

13:11.266 --> 13:13.850
I thought it was the only way
to kill the hunters.

13:13.852 --> 13:16.602
And then when the mother of
my child tried to talk you down

13:16.604 --> 13:19.439
from your delusional ego trip,
you killed her.

13:19.441 --> 13:22.325
I have no idea what happened
to Elizabeth that night.

13:22.327 --> 13:23.476
Don't.

13:24.628 --> 13:26.446
I'm not a teenager
anymore

13:26.448 --> 13:28.214
and I don't have to
listen to your lies.

13:28.216 --> 13:33.903
Charlie, I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

13:33.905 --> 13:36.239
Don't push me.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.992
Push you?

13:39.994 --> 13:41.994
I'm gonna bury you.

13:50.888 --> 13:52.088
Hmm.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.257
Newspapers are disgusting.

13:54.259 --> 13:56.392
We're never gonna find
anything in here.

13:58.229 --> 13:59.395
Who the hell are you?

14:02.399 --> 14:04.183
Grandpa, it's me,
Jake.

14:04.185 --> 14:05.801
That's a lie!

14:13.076 --> 14:14.944
Oh, my God.

14:14.946 --> 14:16.662
It's really you.

14:24.505 --> 14:26.372
You have powers.

14:26.374 --> 14:27.823
The three of you.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.292
You did this together.

14:29.294 --> 14:30.343
You're bound.

14:30.345 --> 14:31.627
Yes.

14:31.629 --> 14:33.713
Is your brother
part of this, too?

14:35.832 --> 14:38.334
Nick's dead.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.887
Oh, no.

14:40.889 --> 14:43.222
No, no, no.

14:44.224 --> 14:45.808
Now it's too late
to stop it.

14:45.810 --> 14:46.826
Stop what?

14:46.828 --> 14:49.445
The circle.

14:49.447 --> 14:51.397
The circle will be
the death of you.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.984
All of you.

14:57.988 --> 14:59.455
You're late.

14:59.457 --> 15:00.856
He'll be here soon.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.041
What about Cassie?

15:02.043 --> 15:04.911
She won't be home
until tonight.

15:04.913 --> 15:08.664
I'm just finishing carving
the symbol for the spell.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.249
I've never seen
anything like that.

15:10.251 --> 15:13.085
Malleus maleficarum.

15:13.087 --> 15:15.605
Hammer of
the witches.

15:15.607 --> 15:17.507
Tell me what to do.

15:17.509 --> 15:20.426
Once he's seated,
the symbol will block his power.

15:20.428 --> 15:22.395
Approach him from behind
with the crystal.

15:22.397 --> 15:24.597
That will
mobilize him.

15:24.599 --> 15:26.232
How do we kill him?

15:41.532 --> 15:43.032
A witch cruet.

15:43.034 --> 15:46.419
Yes. 16 years ago I prepared it for
John Blackwell--

15:46.421 --> 15:48.921
his blood and a ring
he once wore.

15:50.257 --> 15:52.692
I should have killed him when
I had the chance.

15:52.694 --> 15:57.213
I underestimated
his hold on Amelia.

15:57.215 --> 15:59.298
On all of you.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.652
Not this time.

16:08.121 --> 16:10.311
300 years ago,
18 families escaped

16:10.314 --> 16:11.730
from the Salem
witch trials.

16:11.732 --> 16:13.732
They split into
3 circles.

16:13.734 --> 16:15.868
Two of them
stayed east

16:15.870 --> 16:18.503
and one went west
to Chance Harbor.

16:18.505 --> 16:20.489
- Our families.
- Yes.

16:20.491 --> 16:23.413
But 16 years ago,
a Balcoin descendant

16:23.438 --> 16:25.376
named John Blackwell

16:25.379 --> 16:27.779
tried to corrupt
the Chance Harbor circle.

16:27.781 --> 16:29.131
Corrupt them how?

16:29.133 --> 16:30.949
He fed them lies,

16:30.951 --> 16:32.551
taught them
dark magic,

16:32.553 --> 16:34.953
and he pushed them
to confront the witch hunters.

16:34.955 --> 16:36.355
And they were
massacred.

16:36.357 --> 16:37.506
We know.

16:37.508 --> 16:38.640
The other elders
wouldn't listen,

16:38.642 --> 16:40.759
but I never thought
that Blackwell

16:40.761 --> 16:43.495
could be outsmarted
and so easily killed.

16:43.497 --> 16:45.647
I finally realized
that he knew

16:45.649 --> 16:46.882
that he could never
corrupt

16:46.884 --> 16:48.850
and control the circle
from the outside.

16:48.852 --> 16:50.719
He needed to control it
from within.

16:50.721 --> 16:55.774
What Blackwell really
wanted from the circle

16:55.776 --> 16:57.659
was children.

16:58.661 --> 16:59.795
What?

16:59.797 --> 17:01.914
Did you say "children," as in
more than one?

17:01.916 --> 17:04.415
Yes.
Enough Balcoin blood

17:04.417 --> 17:07.484
to ensure that
the next circle would be dark

17:07.487 --> 17:08.569
at its very core.

17:08.571 --> 17:09.788
If the two other circles

17:09.790 --> 17:12.007
have been turned
to darkness like this one has

17:12.009 --> 17:14.159
and all three
are brought together,

17:14.161 --> 17:15.961
it will tip the balance
of power

17:15.963 --> 17:17.378
in the war between
good and evil

17:17.381 --> 17:19.881
and our existence
will be swallowed

17:19.883 --> 17:21.266
by a river of blood.

17:23.603 --> 17:24.886
We shouldn't have
come here.

17:24.887 --> 17:26.605
I'm sorry to disturb
you, grandpa.

17:26.607 --> 17:29.391
Um, if what you're
saying is true,

17:29.393 --> 17:31.460
is there any way
to protect our circle?

17:31.462 --> 17:33.946
Oh, no.
It's too late.

17:33.948 --> 17:36.848
You've been bound.
Your fate is sealed.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.617
What about with crystals?

17:38.619 --> 17:41.511
Well, we know that
the crystals were divided

17:41.536 --> 17:42.538
amongst the elders,

17:42.539 --> 17:43.905
so you must have one.

17:43.907 --> 17:45.157
Maybe that can help us.

17:45.159 --> 17:47.242
No. Absolutely not.

17:47.244 --> 17:48.910
Mine is hidden.
In the wrong hands,

17:48.912 --> 17:51.046
the power of a crystal is far
too dangerous.

17:51.048 --> 17:53.582
How can you be so sure
yours won't get found?

17:53.584 --> 17:55.250
Because it's deep
in a mine,

17:55.252 --> 17:57.202
far from the eyes
of man

17:57.204 --> 18:00.756
and spelled so
that no witch with dark magic

18:00.758 --> 18:01.923
can go near it.

18:01.925 --> 18:03.809
That definitely
sounds hidden.

18:03.811 --> 18:04.999
Well, it has to be.

18:05.024 --> 18:06.224
The 6 crystals,
they form a crystal skull.

18:08.999 --> 18:13.218
The most powerful weapon
of destruction ever created.

18:16.322 --> 18:17.990
You're gonna
want layers.

18:17.992 --> 18:20.993
It gets cold
out there.

18:23.397 --> 18:24.596
Uh, I don't want
to scare you,

18:24.598 --> 18:26.298
but someone put
a romantic picture

18:26.300 --> 18:28.617
of you and the boathouse waiter
onto your phone.

18:28.619 --> 18:32.621
That's Adam.
Um...

18:32.623 --> 18:33.939
We used to date.

18:33.941 --> 18:36.241
So not a security
breach? Phew.

18:36.243 --> 18:40.012
We're not
dating anymore. At all.

18:40.014 --> 18:44.983
Good. That'd make
today awkward.

18:59.232 --> 19:00.649
How about some champagne?

19:00.651 --> 19:03.402
For the picnic.
The real stuff this time.

19:03.404 --> 19:06.104
Actually, have some
chilling on the boat.

19:06.106 --> 19:09.041
Weirdly,
I prefer it warm.

19:09.043 --> 19:11.043
So I'll just grab
a bottle from here.

19:11.045 --> 19:12.110
I'll give you a hand.
No.

19:12.112 --> 19:13.795
Uh, I mean,
thank you,

19:13.797 --> 19:16.415
but I got this one.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.467
I'll be right back.

19:23.789 --> 19:25.957
Seriously?
Right now?

19:25.959 --> 19:27.092
We hit a snag
in the plan.

19:27.094 --> 19:28.844
We need to identify
the right one.

19:28.846 --> 19:30.312
Why don't you
just touch them all

19:30.314 --> 19:31.296
and see if magic
happens?

19:31.298 --> 19:32.731
We did.
Nothing happened.

19:32.733 --> 19:34.466
We think her grandmother
spelled the crystal

19:34.468 --> 19:35.800
so it couldn't
be discovered.

19:35.802 --> 19:37.652
We tried to use circle magic
to counter the spell,

19:37.654 --> 19:38.803
but the two of us
together aren't

19:38.805 --> 19:40.305
as powerful
as my grandmother is.

19:40.307 --> 19:41.639
We need more of
the circle,

19:41.641 --> 19:43.191
and you're
the only one around.

19:46.162 --> 19:47.863
What's going on?

19:47.865 --> 19:52.167
They just needed help
for a school project.

19:52.169 --> 19:54.152
A geology project.

19:54.154 --> 19:56.321
It'll just take a minute.
We got confused

19:56.323 --> 19:59.391
by all the different
kind of quartzes.

19:59.393 --> 20:01.259
Quartzes?

20:01.261 --> 20:03.628
I'll be right up,
I promise.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.797
You know, I took
rocks for jocks senior year.

20:05.799 --> 20:07.132
Maybe
I can help.

20:07.134 --> 20:09.000
We're not actually
supposed to get outside help.

20:09.002 --> 20:10.752
It's kind of
like cheating.

20:10.754 --> 20:12.554
Why don't I just
finish with these guys

20:12.556 --> 20:14.556
and then meet you at the
boat in like 20 minutes?

20:16.859 --> 20:21.363
Um, ok. Sure.

20:24.684 --> 20:27.452
Let's do this
quickly.

20:48.008 --> 20:50.509
Great.
Are we good here?

20:50.511 --> 20:52.010
I have a dream date
to get to.

20:52.012 --> 20:54.429
Good luck.
And sorry.

20:56.499 --> 21:00.018
Ok, I have to
show you something.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.069
Your diary?

21:01.071 --> 21:03.355
My mom's from when
she was our age.

21:03.357 --> 21:06.408
And there is a lot of stuff
about your father in there.

21:06.410 --> 21:09.511
Romantic stuff about the
two of them together

21:09.513 --> 21:12.164
around the time that my mom
got knocked up with me.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.748
No way.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.033
Well, you heard
what he said

21:15.035 --> 21:17.452
about more than one
Blackwell child.

21:17.454 --> 21:19.171
That child could be me.

21:19.173 --> 21:20.622
Isaac did once tell me

21:20.624 --> 21:23.208
that you weren't the only child
of John Blackwell in the circle.

21:23.210 --> 21:24.709
What?

21:24.711 --> 21:26.094
Why didn't you say anything?

21:26.096 --> 21:28.930
It was Isaac. I thought it was all
part of his manipulation.

21:36.973 --> 21:38.640
Somebody stole
my map.

21:38.642 --> 21:40.775
What map?
To the mine.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.277
Where I hid
my crystal.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.366
It's Callum.

21:57.546 --> 21:59.080
We're screwed.

21:59.082 --> 22:00.965
If that lowlife sleezeball
gets the crystal,

22:00.967 --> 22:02.116
we'll never get it back.

22:02.118 --> 22:03.968
- I got it.
- What?

22:03.970 --> 22:05.720
The map Callum stole.

22:05.722 --> 22:07.171
I have it one of the pictures
I took of his wall.

22:07.173 --> 22:09.307
I can send it to
Adam and Melissa.

22:09.309 --> 22:10.842
They can get there
before Callum.

22:12.561 --> 22:15.313
Hey.

22:15.315 --> 22:18.232
I'm sorry about Nick.

22:29.445 --> 22:30.862
Be safe.

22:30.864 --> 22:32.864
I will.

22:37.586 --> 22:41.372
So how exactly did you
unlock your dark magic again?

22:41.374 --> 22:43.441
Faye, drop it, ok.

22:43.443 --> 22:45.593
My father
would never...

22:46.528 --> 22:48.112
You're not
a Blackwell.

22:48.114 --> 22:49.464
What's the matter,
scared of someone

22:49.466 --> 22:50.782
stealing your
dark magic thunder?

22:50.784 --> 22:53.851
Fine. I was on
the brink of death

22:53.853 --> 22:55.169
when my dark magic
kicked in.

22:55.171 --> 22:57.972
Diana's grandmother was
burying me alive at the time.

22:57.974 --> 22:59.690
So if you want, I
can give her a call

22:59.692 --> 23:01.943
and you can
test it out.

23:02.978 --> 23:05.363
Let's just get
the crystal first,

23:05.365 --> 23:07.181
and then we'll see.

23:09.969 --> 23:12.153
Sorry about earlier.

23:12.155 --> 23:13.871
Yeah. That was
kind of weird.

23:13.873 --> 23:15.873
I know.
It's just midterms.

23:15.875 --> 23:18.659
My friends are, like,
totally stressed out.

23:18.661 --> 23:20.545
You know what's
great for stress?

23:20.547 --> 23:22.380
Long sails
during sunset.

23:22.382 --> 23:24.082
To bad for them
they're not you.

23:24.084 --> 23:25.366
Yeah, too bad for them.

23:27.053 --> 23:28.386
No way.

23:28.388 --> 23:32.373
Sorry.

23:33.342 --> 23:34.892
I can't believe I'm
about to do this.

23:34.894 --> 23:36.544
Please tell me
you're kidding.

23:36.546 --> 23:40.064
I'm sorry. It's...
I have to deal with--

23:40.066 --> 23:41.715
A geology project
emergency?

23:41.717 --> 23:46.154
A midterm? A combo?
It's Saturday.

23:46.156 --> 23:48.156
It's complicated.

23:48.158 --> 23:51.109
And I can't explain
right now.

23:51.111 --> 23:53.561
I came completely clean
with you

23:53.563 --> 23:56.447
because you wanted trust,
and you were right.

23:56.449 --> 23:58.616
But so do it.

23:58.618 --> 24:00.868
What's going on?
Tell me.

24:00.870 --> 24:03.004
I can't.
I'm sorry.

24:04.006 --> 24:05.006
Yeah, me, too.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.507
At least when I was lying,

24:06.509 --> 24:07.592
it was to be with you more.

24:07.594 --> 24:08.726
You're lying to get
away from me.

24:08.728 --> 24:11.262
I'm sorry.

24:11.264 --> 24:15.600
I gave you a day to show me
who you really are.

24:15.602 --> 24:20.021
And if you gave me
a day when you come back,

24:20.023 --> 24:21.939
I will do the same.

24:21.941 --> 24:24.559
I don't know if
I'll be coming back.

24:30.699 --> 24:31.983
I'm sorry.

24:50.003 --> 24:51.952
I don't see
Callum's motorcycle.

24:51.954 --> 24:53.304
Are they sure it was him?

24:53.306 --> 24:55.306
Yes.
I'm sorry, Melissa.

24:55.308 --> 24:57.592
I guess my taste in guys
has hit a new low

24:57.594 --> 24:58.943
I never imagined possible.

24:58.945 --> 25:01.879
At least we got here
first.

25:14.476 --> 25:17.662
So, where
do we go now?

25:19.665 --> 25:21.516
Up there.

25:33.095 --> 25:35.196
How bad can it be?

25:35.198 --> 25:36.480
Besides
old explosives,

25:36.482 --> 25:38.282
poison gas,
and cave ins,

25:38.284 --> 25:40.768
not bad at all.

25:58.403 --> 26:00.655
Look, we're gonna need
some light in here.

26:00.657 --> 26:03.958
Focus on those bulbs.

26:07.329 --> 26:09.130
It's not working.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.583
Wait.

26:18.173 --> 26:19.924
Rust.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.592
They were mining
for iron ore.

26:21.594 --> 26:23.394
Magic won't work
down there.

26:24.563 --> 26:27.231
And this is a dangerous
place to be normal.

26:29.017 --> 26:31.068
Wait,
what's this?

26:36.775 --> 26:38.276
Come on.

26:45.484 --> 26:47.418
Well, thank you,
Jane.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.503
I really appreciate
the invitation.

26:49.505 --> 26:51.455
As I said on the phone,

26:51.457 --> 26:55.376
I'm willing to try
for Cassie's sake.

26:55.378 --> 26:58.168
She says that you two
have had a chance to

26:58.193 --> 26:59.682
spend some time together.

27:00.767 --> 27:03.267
Yes. It was a little
rocky at first,

27:03.269 --> 27:05.403
but I, uh, I think

27:05.405 --> 27:08.639
that we're finally
starting to get, um...

27:08.641 --> 27:10.891
comfortable
with one another.

27:14.780 --> 27:17.765
Everything all right,
John?

27:17.767 --> 27:18.899
You look a little pale.

27:18.901 --> 27:21.786
Jane, what did you
do to me?

27:21.788 --> 27:23.904
He can't move now.
Hand me the crystal.

27:25.457 --> 27:29.627
Charles. Still a
ladies' man, I see.

27:29.629 --> 27:32.546
And by that, I mean
hiding behind them.

27:32.548 --> 27:35.483
Please allow me.

27:35.485 --> 27:37.918
It would be
my distinct honor.

27:38.837 --> 27:39.970
Not yet.

27:39.972 --> 27:40.921
What are you doing?

27:40.923 --> 27:42.306
I never believed
my daughter's death

27:42.308 --> 27:43.758
was an accident.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.477
I think John knows
what really happened.

27:46.479 --> 27:47.961
Listen to me.
Don't lose your focus.

27:47.963 --> 27:50.147
If he did it, he's not gonna
tell you, so what's the point?

27:50.149 --> 27:51.732
The crystal will help
with that.

27:53.402 --> 27:55.403
And I have to know
the truth.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.076
Wait.

28:02.078 --> 28:04.745
I think it's here.

28:06.648 --> 28:08.749
No.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.589
Do you hear that?

28:22.664 --> 28:24.098
Tell me
we're not lost.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.501
Actually, I think
this is the place.

28:29.187 --> 28:31.605
It should be
right back there.

28:41.116 --> 28:42.733
How deep do you
think it is?

28:42.735 --> 28:44.985
I don't know.

28:47.188 --> 28:48.489
Wait.

28:53.361 --> 28:54.628
What are you doing?

28:56.364 --> 28:58.215
Adam.

28:58.217 --> 29:00.251
Adam, what are
you doing?

29:00.253 --> 29:02.470
What are you doing?

29:03.588 --> 29:06.507
You don't even know if that's
gonna hold you.

29:06.509 --> 29:07.842
I'll be fine.

29:25.243 --> 29:28.329
Adam, be careful.

29:50.135 --> 29:51.469
Whoa!
Adam!

29:54.606 --> 29:56.774
Adam.

30:04.566 --> 30:05.950
Ok, let's go.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.504
Hello, darling.

31:05.704 --> 31:08.817
Callum, what are you
doing here?

31:08.917 --> 31:11.568
I was following
your buddy Jake,

31:11.570 --> 31:13.504
hoping to collect
a little blood,

31:13.506 --> 31:16.073
maybe give him a taste
of some voodoo revenge.

31:16.075 --> 31:20.911
Then, this amazing, massive
opportunity presented itself.

31:20.913 --> 31:24.798
And you know how
I'm a sucker for opportunity.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.684
Why don't you toss me
that crystal?

31:26.686 --> 31:27.851
Don't, Adam.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.470
Come on, baby,
don't be selfish.

31:29.472 --> 31:32.439
You've got plenty of magic when
you're not deep in an iron mine.

31:32.441 --> 31:34.074
If you know what
this crystal is,

31:34.076 --> 31:36.143
you know it's
useless to you.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.344
See, that's where
you're wrong.

31:37.346 --> 31:39.647
Big magic is big money.

31:39.649 --> 31:41.803
And I'm finally gonna
have enough to retire

31:41.828 --> 31:43.389
to my own voodoo island.

31:44.919 --> 31:47.071
You can come with me
if you want.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.074
Your friends don't seem
like a lot of laughs.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.792
Callum, put the gun
away.

31:51.794 --> 31:56.830
Well, I would, but this guy won't
give me the crystal without it.

31:58.883 --> 31:59.967
I mean, I could have shot him

31:59.969 --> 32:01.835
and I could have ran
out of here already.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.921
I'm trying to show you
that I'm not a bad guy.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.559
Uhh!

32:08.561 --> 32:12.096
Bad idea, superhero.
Bad idea!

32:12.098 --> 32:13.130
Here.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.233
Take it and leave.

32:25.309 --> 32:28.445
Your loss.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.512
I just heard a gunshot
from inside the mine.

32:45.514 --> 32:48.182
I think Adam and Melissa
are still in there.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.140
Look,
there's Callum.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.725
We've got to stop him.

32:57.727 --> 32:58.859
Wait.

32:58.861 --> 33:01.678
We have to make sure
Adam and Melissa are ok.

33:09.572 --> 33:11.121
What is it?

33:12.690 --> 33:14.691
What is it?
My dark magic.

33:14.693 --> 33:17.711
Your grandfather,
he spelled the tunnel.

33:17.713 --> 33:19.680
I can't breathe
in there.

33:19.682 --> 33:21.131
Go help Faye and Diana.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.250
Ok, here,
take the map.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.878
Diana, stay back.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.313
We can stop him
with circle magic.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.816
No. I have to do this alone.

33:38.818 --> 33:41.635
To access my own magic.
What?

33:41.637 --> 33:43.437
I need to access
my own magic.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.606
What are you
talking about?

33:47.826 --> 33:48.992
What are you doing?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.746
Faye, get--get back!

33:54.732 --> 33:55.899
Faye, get out of the way.

33:58.402 --> 33:59.953
Faye!

34:15.219 --> 34:17.271
Faye.

34:17.273 --> 34:18.472
What happened?

34:18.474 --> 34:20.056
She wouldn't move.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.092
Faye,
are you all right?

34:22.094 --> 34:24.945
My magic,
it didn't work.

34:27.782 --> 34:30.000
I knew nothing about
Amelia's death.

34:30.002 --> 34:31.702
I loved her
just like you did.

34:31.704 --> 34:35.121
Don't you do dare compare your
love for my daughter with mine.

34:35.123 --> 34:39.609
But in the end, she ran away from
both of us, didn't she, Jane?

34:39.610 --> 34:40.960
Didn't she?

34:44.782 --> 34:46.400
The crystal's clear.

34:46.402 --> 34:49.353
If I was lying,
it would turn black.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.922
You have
your answer.

34:52.925 --> 34:56.143
Maybe he can deflect
the crystal's power.

34:56.145 --> 34:57.460
No, he's telling
the truth.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.847
It doesn't matter.
It's time for him to die.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.064
We can't kill him.

35:01.066 --> 35:03.684
Of course we can.
For everything he's done.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.102
We have an agreement.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.570
He didn't kill Amelia.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.805
I can't do it.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.910
No, I'll spell him,
weaken him.

35:12.912 --> 35:14.294
You don't have
enough power.

35:14.296 --> 35:15.312
He'll get free,
and he'll come after us.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.830
You're making
a mistake, Charles.

35:16.832 --> 35:19.032
Shut up!
Charles, put that down.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.235
Listen to her. You don't really
want to do this.

35:21.237 --> 35:23.370
Send you to hell?

35:31.430 --> 35:33.463
Jane!

35:33.465 --> 35:35.015
Jane.

35:35.017 --> 35:36.850
Ahh!

35:49.197 --> 35:52.182
I had days alone
in this house

35:52.184 --> 35:56.069
just remember how much
Jane used to despise me.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.244
And finding where
she hid the cruet?

36:04.246 --> 36:05.862
That was child's play.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.864
And you remade it
into her cruet.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.200
Yes.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.336
Ahh!

36:12.338 --> 36:14.321
But let's just keep
that between us.

36:14.323 --> 36:16.890
And the only reason
you're not dead right now

36:16.892 --> 36:20.710
is I still have use
for you.

36:41.432 --> 36:44.749
Wait!
Let me go!

36:46.585 --> 36:49.021
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Wait!

36:49.023 --> 36:50.389
Wait, what are
you guys doing?

36:50.391 --> 36:52.140
I can't let you
hurt the circle.

36:52.142 --> 36:55.444
Look, I swear, I'm never gonna
mess with you guys again, any of you.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.611
No, you won't.

36:57.981 --> 36:59.948
No! No! No!

36:59.950 --> 37:02.367
No! No!

37:07.409 --> 37:13.714
Cibé áit tu air,
an aimsir fháistineach tusa.

37:18.586 --> 37:20.504
You've been marked.

37:20.506 --> 37:23.290
If you ever come back
to Chance Harbor again,

37:23.292 --> 37:24.341
we'll know.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.677
And next time we
won't let you go.

37:38.356 --> 37:41.191
Where'd you get that?

37:41.193 --> 37:43.694
From an old friend.

37:43.696 --> 37:47.331
You have a lot more friends
than you let on, don't you?

37:47.333 --> 37:52.953
Like my mom.
She wrote all about you.

37:52.955 --> 37:54.421
What did she write?

37:54.423 --> 37:56.890
Well, she practiced writing
"Dawn Blackwell"

37:56.915 --> 37:58.779
about a thousand times.

37:58.827 --> 38:02.513
Let's just say the rest
was rated NC-17.

38:02.515 --> 38:05.015
Does she know
you read this?

38:05.017 --> 38:10.888
Well, I'd like to think she'd
show it to me one day

38:10.890 --> 38:13.390
when she was ready
to tell me the truth

38:13.392 --> 38:18.695
about you and her
and me.

38:21.916 --> 38:24.124
Heh. Faye, this is...

38:24.149 --> 38:27.672
This is a testament to
your mother's imagination.

38:28.424 --> 38:30.290
Dawn had a crush on me,

38:30.292 --> 38:33.243
but it, it never
went beyond that.

38:34.779 --> 38:36.363
It's the truth.

38:37.298 --> 38:40.017
Then I'm not
your daughter.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.770
No.

38:44.389 --> 38:46.607
But your father
was my friend

38:46.609 --> 38:48.725
and he was
a very good man.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.713
Did he know how my
mom felt about you?

38:55.984 --> 38:57.985
He loved your mother.

38:57.987 --> 39:03.340
And he knew that she could
be a little obsessed sometimes,

39:03.342 --> 39:04.858
but he didn't let it
get to him.

39:04.860 --> 39:09.847
He loved her strength
and he loved her passion.

39:09.849 --> 39:13.083
And I just wish
he would have lived

39:13.085 --> 39:14.835
so that he could
see you now

39:14.837 --> 39:17.438
because he'd be
very proud of you.

39:21.876 --> 39:25.963
I guess I should put this back
where I found it.

39:25.965 --> 39:27.464
Faye.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.016
You're not alone.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.084
You have your circle.

39:31.086 --> 39:32.419
And I might not
be your father,

39:32.421 --> 39:34.538
but I'm here, too, ok?

39:52.290 --> 39:53.657
Hey, there.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.642
Hey.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.744
I got your text.

39:57.746 --> 39:59.446
You ok?

39:59.448 --> 40:01.865
I need to take
a break

40:01.867 --> 40:04.701
from the circle
for a little while.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.019
What?

40:06.021 --> 40:08.071
I just...

40:08.073 --> 40:10.757
I feel like
I'm suffocating,

40:10.759 --> 40:15.179
like the circle is taking over
every part of my existence.

40:15.181 --> 40:17.915
You are the circle,
Diana.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.399
I mean, you're the one
who started it,

40:19.401 --> 40:22.085
who guided the rest of us.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.921
Look, I know you like
this new guys.

40:23.923 --> 40:25.606
Yeah, I do.

40:25.608 --> 40:27.824
And instead of trying to get to
know each other

40:27.826 --> 40:29.610
for what should have
been the best date ever,

40:29.612 --> 40:32.529
I spent the whole time
lying and hiding.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.948
I can't be with him
and the circle. It won't work.

40:34.950 --> 40:36.833
Yeah, but you can't
just walk away.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.202
Not now.

40:38.204 --> 40:41.371
If we don't work together,
then we could get killed.

40:41.373 --> 40:46.043
The circle, our parents,
our grandparents.

40:46.045 --> 40:48.161
You know this.

40:48.163 --> 40:51.715
I will see the witch hunter
thing through.

40:51.717 --> 40:54.885
And then I'm out.

40:57.055 --> 40:59.089
It's not that simple.

40:59.091 --> 41:01.808
We need each other.

41:01.810 --> 41:05.512
Like today, you barely
made it to the mine on time.

41:05.514 --> 41:08.031
Adam and Melissa, they were
almost killed in there.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.516
I was there in time.

41:09.518 --> 41:10.567
I heard the gunshot.

41:10.569 --> 41:11.868
I just couldn't
get in.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.253
What do you mean?

41:13.255 --> 41:15.322
I couldn't get in.

41:15.324 --> 41:17.857
I tried, but when
I stepped inside,

41:17.859 --> 41:19.910
it felt like my lungs were
gonna explode.

41:19.912 --> 41:22.913
I couldn't breathe, I could barely
have enough air to gag.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.265
So don't tell me
what I did and didn't do.

41:25.267 --> 41:27.751
The mine was spelled.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.653
That's why you
couldn't get in.

41:29.655 --> 41:32.889
That's why I couldn't
get in.

41:32.891 --> 41:35.309
Oh, my God.
It's true.

41:35.311 --> 41:37.511
What are you
talking about?

41:37.513 --> 41:39.529
It's you.

41:39.531 --> 41:42.165
What's me?

41:42.167 --> 41:45.235
You're the other Blackwell
in the circle.

41:46.854 --> 41:49.856
You're my sister.

41:53.083 --> 41:57.083
