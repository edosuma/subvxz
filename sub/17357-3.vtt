WEBVTT

00:09.890 --> 00:11.347
Hey, where are we going, anyway?

00:11.348 --> 00:13.899
Remember the time when you borrowed my iPad

00:13.900 --> 00:15.723
to figure how to get a
more powerful shower head?

00:15.789 --> 00:17.182
Yeah.

00:19.931 --> 00:21.721
Oh!

00:23.146 --> 00:26.094
Remember the time I
gave you my Armani jacket

00:26.095 --> 00:27.687
to impress this high-profile client?

00:34.974 --> 00:37.195
Okay, I remember that.

00:37.196 --> 00:38.919
W... what's the point here?

00:38.920 --> 00:40.244
That I'm a horrible person.

00:40.245 --> 00:42.002
No, you're not a horrible person.

00:42.003 --> 00:43.790
It's, like, those favors add up.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.549
- Let's not mention...
- You're keeping tally?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.700
All the free drugs I've been giving you.

00:47.701 --> 00:49.953
Don't bring the drugs into
it, man, we're friends.

00:49.954 --> 00:51.179
- Yeah, we're friends.
- Yeah.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.765
You may be popping a lot of mileage, okay?

00:53.766 --> 00:55.885
- All right.
- And my friends pay me back.

00:55.886 --> 00:57.643
All right, okay. Well, how about this?

00:57.644 --> 00:59.763
I got a solution right here.
How about we're not friends?

00:59.764 --> 01:01.188
How about we're merely acquaintances?

01:01.189 --> 01:05.358
Look, I got a way you can pay this off.

01:06.556 --> 01:08.644
A newsstand. And I own it.

01:08.645 --> 01:10.369
- You what?
- I own it.

01:10.435 --> 01:12.952
I had no idea you were
such a media mongrel, man!

01:12.953 --> 01:14.808
Actually, just to clean my greens.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.431
- Oh!
- This is all cash business,

01:16.432 --> 01:17.691
no questions asked.

01:17.692 --> 01:20.441
- Know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, sort of.

01:20.442 --> 01:23.294
I'm gonna need you to run
the place for a day or two,

01:23.358 --> 01:25.479
until I find something more sustainable.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.031
Can you do that? We'll be even.

01:28.032 --> 01:30.847
It's easy, all you got to
do is open, close the place.

01:30.848 --> 01:32.835
This is literally a cake walk for you.

01:32.836 --> 01:35.022
All you got to do is simply... exist.

01:35.023 --> 01:36.945
Okay. Well, it's good.

01:36.946 --> 01:39.200
That's good news because if
there's one thing I'm good at

01:39.265 --> 01:40.557
it's simply just existing.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.579
Also I'm pretty good at talking to girls.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.333
That's the second thing that I'm good at.

01:44.334 --> 01:45.527
Don't let me down.

01:45.528 --> 01:46.919
No. Never. I won't. I won't.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.075
Thank you. Thank you for
trusting me with this.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.598
Of course.

01:50.599 --> 01:52.288
Now, before you take off,

01:52.289 --> 01:55.538
I believe there was some
mention of a cake walk?

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

02:42.328 --> 02:43.885

Hey, you have some of
them paper from last week

02:46.437 --> 02:47.928

02:47.929 --> 02:49.916
Last week? Come on, man, that's old news.

02:49.917 --> 02:52.999
No, no, me don't need the
news, me just need da weight.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.418
Me have a blanket that move on its own.

02:55.419 --> 02:57.041
No wind, no reason.

02:57.042 --> 02:58.399
Just move about the place.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.857
Could be a ghost.

02:59.858 --> 03:01.617
Why you say that?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.404
Primordially, I'm kind of a medium.

03:03.405 --> 03:05.326
This is just my side gig. Don't be fooled.

03:05.327 --> 03:07.248
Sounds like to me what
you're dealing with here...

03:07.249 --> 03:08.806
textbook apparitional attachment.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.796
Would you take a look?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.671
No... No, no. I gotta stay here.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.824
I promised my friend. He's counting on me.

03:16.825 --> 03:19.478
Man, listen, you work
hard, you deserved a break.

03:19.544 --> 03:21.829
- You earned it.
- Yeah.

03:21.830 --> 03:24.184
- Yeah, it has been 25 minutes.
- Yeah, man.

03:28.722 --> 03:29.915
Anyway...

03:29.916 --> 03:31.672
this is the Bootleggah Row

03:31.673 --> 03:33.299
where we sell with things there

03:33.300 --> 03:34.952
whatever you need.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.604
You need clothes, jewelry...
you name it, we have it.

03:37.605 --> 03:38.928
Them call me Gucci Man.

03:38.929 --> 03:41.049
Of course, I sell Gucci... mainly.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.965
And this the blanket I bring you here for.

03:43.966 --> 03:45.689
It belong to my friend Shaky Hands.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.014
But now him dead.

03:47.015 --> 03:49.500
Ever since him gone,
that blanket move around

03:49.501 --> 03:51.090
like a mad girl that dirty whines.

03:51.091 --> 03:52.716
Scaring my customer there.

03:52.717 --> 03:54.836
Yeah. Well, doesn't
look like he's here now.

03:54.837 --> 03:57.023
- Easy, easy, easy.
- That's okay.

03:57.024 --> 03:59.772
Take a closer look.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.194
I'm not really getting anything, Gucci.

04:02.259 --> 04:03.584
I gotta get back to my newsstand now.

04:03.585 --> 04:04.876
No, easy, man.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.931
Listen, we need your help. Please, man.

04:06.932 --> 04:08.655
Whatever you... Name your price.

04:08.656 --> 04:10.444
We'll have it.

04:10.445 --> 04:14.387
Maybe I can have this charming
little Duffle right here.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.507
Easy, man, that's a real thing.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.159
That's real Gucci. Retail, $2,000.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.877
- Ew!
- Yeah, man.

04:21.878 --> 04:25.258
Maybe me give you a good deal
if you get rid of the ghost.

04:25.259 --> 04:27.444
Let's say you'll have $50!

04:27.445 --> 04:29.997
- 50... I don't know.
- You know, forget it, man.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.653
Okay, well... Yeah... okay, deal, $50.

04:31.654 --> 04:33.143
Oh, that's too low.

04:33.144 --> 04:35.464
- I lose so much.
- All right, all right, 75...

04:35.465 --> 04:37.253
- $75, please?
- You know what...

04:37.254 --> 04:40.103
you have a deal but you don't tell no one.

04:40.104 --> 04:43.053
We got ourselves a good
deal. You understand?

04:43.054 --> 04:45.573
- What deal?
- I knew I like you, man.

04:47.197 --> 04:51.271
Let's get you out of there.
Check those on your face.

04:51.272 --> 04:53.525
Well, put a hat on you.

04:53.526 --> 04:56.076
Put a little cap on you.

04:56.077 --> 04:58.064
Come on out and join us.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.113
How about... uh...

05:01.114 --> 05:02.441
How about a cigarette?

05:04.129 --> 05:05.523
Hey!

05:06.913 --> 05:09.928
Oh, you're one tough guy.

05:09.929 --> 05:12.184
You wanna know a tough guy?

05:13.773 --> 05:15.826
No. Oh, you're tough.

05:15.827 --> 05:17.020
Come on!

05:17.021 --> 05:18.378
Ow!

05:18.379 --> 05:20.863
You know how much that hurt?

05:20.864 --> 05:22.156
What are you doin' with my blanket?

05:22.157 --> 05:23.350
Your blanket?

05:23.351 --> 05:24.908
Here, Shaky Hands.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.599
- Who told you that?
- Your friend, Gucci Main.

05:26.664 --> 05:29.314
Gucci? He's the one who gave
me that dumb-ass nickname.

05:29.315 --> 05:31.402
My real name's Melville.

05:31.403 --> 05:33.357
- Melville?
- Yeah.

05:33.358 --> 05:34.915
Where the name Shaky Hands come from?

05:34.916 --> 05:37.102
I'm a bootlegger. DVDs.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.157
I used to sit in the back
of a theater, filming movies

05:39.158 --> 05:41.742
like it was my job, but
I got tremors in my hands.

05:41.743 --> 05:43.199
All my movies look like Bourne Identity.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.956
Shit's going all over the place.

05:44.957 --> 05:46.679
Hence, "Shaky Hands."

05:46.680 --> 05:48.567
- Oh, that's not even clever.
- That's what I said!

05:48.568 --> 05:50.126
But you know how nicknames are.

05:50.127 --> 05:51.914
The more you complain, the more they stick.

05:51.915 --> 05:54.135
I hear you. When I was in grade school,

05:54.136 --> 05:57.054
my friends started to call me
Shit Eater because one time...

05:58.178 --> 05:59.834
Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

05:59.835 --> 06:01.857
The point is, I'm here to finish

06:01.858 --> 06:04.507
your unfinished business.
What are you, a medium?

06:04.508 --> 06:06.099
- Yes.
- How does this shit work?

06:06.100 --> 06:09.743
- Just tell me what I can do to help.
- Okay.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.594
Now, the day I died...

06:12.595 --> 06:14.516
I went to this French art house place.

06:14.517 --> 06:17.034
I don't know what it was that day,

06:17.035 --> 06:18.692
I was in the zone.

06:18.693 --> 06:22.039
I filmed the steadiest movie of my life.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.496
About 90 minutes in,

06:23.497 --> 06:24.988
two guys entered the theater.

06:24.989 --> 06:26.811
Walked over to front row guy.

06:26.812 --> 06:29.725
Straight up murder his ass!

06:29.726 --> 06:33.272
At first, they didn't realize I was there,

06:33.273 --> 06:35.691
but noticed the red light of my camera.

06:35.692 --> 06:37.548
They chased me for blocks,

06:37.549 --> 06:40.365
but thankfully, I was
able to duck down an alley,

06:40.366 --> 06:41.723
stash the camera,

06:41.724 --> 06:43.479
and just barely escaped with my life.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.672
Where'd he go?

06:44.673 --> 06:45.831
This way! This way!

06:45.832 --> 06:48.055
Later that day, my throat... slit.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.730
Those goons found you and
straight up murdered your ass?

06:51.731 --> 06:53.254
No, shaving accident. My own fault.

06:53.255 --> 06:55.642
- Shaky Hands.
- We ought to get that tape.

06:55.643 --> 06:58.259
Got it. You want to expose
the murder you witnessed.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.985
What? No!

07:00.049 --> 07:02.095
That was the steadiest film I've ever done.

07:02.096 --> 07:02.931
Oh!

07:02.932 --> 07:05.350
See, I need you to get the
tape, so you can show my friends

07:05.351 --> 07:07.132
so they can stop calling me Shaky Hands!

07:07.133 --> 07:08.167
Oh.

07:08.168 --> 07:09.659
I stashed the camera around the corner.

07:09.660 --> 07:10.620
- Let's go.
- Okay, all right.

07:10.621 --> 07:13.304
As long as we're back in two shakes.

07:13.305 --> 07:16.485
As long as we're back in two minutes.

07:16.486 --> 07:17.812
Lead the way.

07:20.430 --> 07:23.113
Here's the other thing I
don't get about being a ghost.

07:23.114 --> 07:24.505
You saw I can move that blanket, right?

07:24.506 --> 07:27.156
- Yeah.
- How come I can't do this?

07:27.157 --> 07:29.342
- I can't pick it up, man.
- Yeah, it's the pits.

07:29.343 --> 07:31.133
You can do things, but
you can't do anything

07:31.134 --> 07:33.221
that'll physically affect
your unfinished business,

07:33.222 --> 07:34.446
like the one thing you want to do.

07:34.447 --> 07:35.939
Ain't that some shit?

07:35.940 --> 07:38.854
It is some shit, but it keeps me in a job.

07:38.855 --> 07:41.141
Ahh! Ahh!

07:41.142 --> 07:43.327
Come on, man!

07:43.328 --> 07:44.918
Oh, you should've seen your face.

07:44.919 --> 07:46.476
Just like when someone
sneaks up behind you.

07:46.477 --> 07:48.265
You know... Blah! Oh!

07:48.266 --> 07:50.950
Oh! Oh! Help!

07:50.951 --> 07:52.143
Shakes.

07:52.144 --> 07:54.266
Hey, police! Call 911!

08:07.221 --> 08:09.477
Okay, w-who are you, guys?

08:09.543 --> 08:12.822
And why are all so attractive?

08:12.823 --> 08:16.201
Have you ever heard of the Mafia?

08:16.202 --> 08:19.151
Yeah, You don't sound Italian.

08:19.152 --> 08:20.741
We are The Swedish Mafia.

08:20.742 --> 08:23.029
I didn't know there was a Swedish Mafia.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.390
We are new.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.573
Good for you guys. Solid.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.590
I need to tell you you got to let me go.

08:29.591 --> 08:31.743
I don't know why I'm here

08:31.744 --> 08:34.595
but I'm supposed to be watching
my friends newsstand, okay?

08:34.596 --> 08:36.715
It's probably being robbed right now.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.437
You are not going anywhere

08:38.438 --> 08:39.664
until you tell us

08:39.664 --> 08:42.082
how did you know where to find that camera.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.767
Shaky Hands. Shaky Hands...

08:44.768 --> 08:48.083
He stashed it. He showed
me where to find it.

08:49.342 --> 08:50.964
Uh... You're gonna tell us

08:50.965 --> 08:53.384
- where is Shaky Hands now?
- Please don't.

08:53.385 --> 08:55.671
It won't do you any good. He's dead.

08:55.672 --> 08:57.890
But he told you where is camera.

08:57.891 --> 09:00.641
Yes, his ghost told me
where to find the camera.

09:00.642 --> 09:03.291
But he... He's a ghost.

09:03.292 --> 09:07.462
See, I'm sort of a
medium. I talk to ghosts.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.055
Okay, prove it. Talk to a ghost.

09:10.119 --> 09:13.200
I can't. There's no...

09:13.201 --> 09:15.586
There's no ghost in here right now.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.013
What about your Shaky Hand ghost?

09:17.079 --> 09:18.801
A very good question.

09:18.802 --> 09:20.557
I will pose to him

09:20.558 --> 09:22.181
when next I lain my eyes upon him.

09:22.182 --> 09:23.638
Enough!

09:23.639 --> 09:26.389
If this fat arse is not
gonna answer questions,

09:26.390 --> 09:28.378
- get rid of him.
- Oh, no, d-d-don't.

09:28.379 --> 09:29.736
Come on, please.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.222
Swedish Mafia regulations
require that I grant you

09:32.223 --> 09:34.279
any last wishes.

09:36.432 --> 09:39.581
Honestly, I'm so hungry,
I can't think of any.

09:41.965 --> 09:44.086
These meatballs are very delicious,

09:44.087 --> 09:46.838
but I think there might be something wrong

09:46.905 --> 09:48.195
with this brown tomato sauce.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.151
That's gravy, you idiot.

09:50.152 --> 09:51.907
They're Swedish meatballs.

09:51.908 --> 09:53.564
Flown in from Stockholm yesterday.

09:53.565 --> 09:57.274
Stockholm, a gorgeous city.
Not dirty like New York.

09:57.275 --> 10:01.450
Where beautiful women flow
around like lingonberry soda.

10:01.451 --> 10:03.971
Sounds like the Swedish place ever!

10:08.942 --> 10:12.088
I'm starting to like you guys.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.446
Oh, my God.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.332
I'm not getting Stockholm Syndrome, am I?

10:19.047 --> 10:21.235
Well, am I? Is that a real thing?

10:21.236 --> 10:23.388
- I don't even know.
- Excuse me.

10:23.389 --> 10:26.369
- You're in my chair.
- Sir Elton John?

10:26.370 --> 10:28.193
Niklas Soderberg.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.110
Godfather of the Swedish Mafia.

10:31.111 --> 10:32.766
I'm Kevin Pacalioglu,

10:32.767 --> 10:35.087
the Godfather part 3
of ghost communicators.

10:35.088 --> 10:37.108
Wait, if you can hear me,

10:37.109 --> 10:39.825
perhaps you can do something for me?

10:39.826 --> 10:41.681
No, no. Now is not a good time.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.438
Your men mean to kill me

10:43.505 --> 10:47.679
if I can't think of a way to
prove that I talk to ghosts.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.961
I can talk to Don Soderberg.

10:50.962 --> 10:53.579
I can talk to the Don.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.003
The Don has been dead for months.

10:55.004 --> 10:56.494
Yeah, he's standing right here.

10:56.495 --> 11:00.339
His ghost is right here, right next to me.

11:00.406 --> 11:01.796
Careful, vennen.

11:01.797 --> 11:04.017
You have invoked the
name of the most feared

11:04.018 --> 11:07.397
and respected man in the short
history of the Swedish Mafia.

11:07.398 --> 11:10.780
If you are lying, we will
kill you where you stand.

11:12.732 --> 11:14.025
- Sievert...
- Hmm?

11:14.026 --> 11:16.214
If he can prove he talks to ghosts,

11:16.279 --> 11:18.398
we don't have to worry about bootlegger.

11:18.399 --> 11:19.725
No more loose ends.

11:19.726 --> 11:21.282
Tell me

11:21.283 --> 11:25.452
what song would Don Soderberg play

11:25.691 --> 11:27.115
before an execution?

11:27.181 --> 11:28.804
Before an execution.

11:28.805 --> 11:30.661
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:30.662 --> 11:33.678
"Lovefool" by the Cardigans.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.261
Sound right to you?

11:36.262 --> 11:37.620
You're good.

11:37.621 --> 11:40.238
Listen, I need you to do something for me.

11:40.239 --> 11:42.029
It's extremely difficult for me but...

11:42.093 --> 11:44.147
He's talking.

11:44.148 --> 11:47.000
I'm gay.

11:47.064 --> 11:49.351
And I need you to tell my family

11:49.352 --> 11:52.498
so that I can go from
the dark into the Light.

11:52.499 --> 11:55.151
That's it? Why didn't you tell
your family before you died?

11:55.152 --> 11:58.165
- That's no big deal.
- What did he say?

11:58.166 --> 12:00.418
N... no, no. W... what, this family?

12:00.419 --> 12:02.109
No, if I tell that, they'll just kill me.

12:02.110 --> 12:04.198
If you don't tell us, we'll kill you!

12:04.199 --> 12:06.685
Okay, okay. Okay... okay.

12:09.931 --> 12:14.100
The Don was living a
double life as a homosexual.

12:16.029 --> 12:19.542
He had an insatiable appetite for D.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.953
He had to have it all the time

12:22.954 --> 12:26.864
morning, noon and night
in the mouth and in his...

12:26.865 --> 12:29.083
kanelbulle and in his...

12:29.084 --> 12:32.100
part of his body that I can't pronounce.

12:32.101 --> 12:36.046
Now, don't kill me any sooner
than you were already going to.

12:37.835 --> 12:41.742
That sounds right. The Don, he likes boys.

12:41.743 --> 12:42.970
He likes the boys.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.792
- You guys aren't upset?
- No.

12:44.793 --> 12:48.007
Who among us hasn't sucked a kook or two?

12:48.008 --> 12:49.333
Or three.

12:51.089 --> 12:53.740
Yeah, this we could
tell was the case anyway.

12:53.741 --> 12:55.164
Yeah, to the Don.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.525
To the Don.

12:56.591 --> 12:58.710
Oh, my God. Such a relief.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.463
I had a feeling they would be
okay with it, but I didn't know.

13:01.528 --> 13:02.954
Oh, gee.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.097
What was that?

13:12.098 --> 13:14.750
That was the Don heading into his Light.

13:14.751 --> 13:17.567
Him telling you guys that he was a homo

13:17.568 --> 13:19.157
was his last unfinished business here.

13:19.158 --> 13:21.676
- He's just gone... forever?
- Yes.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.724
But before he left, he
told me to tell you guys

13:24.725 --> 13:27.044
that you should let me go, so I'm gonna go.

13:27.045 --> 13:29.562
If the Don said so. It must be done.

13:29.563 --> 13:30.756
Wait.

13:30.757 --> 13:33.507
It is a tenet of the Swedish Mafia

13:33.508 --> 13:36.357
that dead men don't talk.

13:36.358 --> 13:41.326
- But if ghosts can still talk...
- Then those loose ends...

13:41.327 --> 13:42.752
- They're still loose.
- Yeah.

13:42.753 --> 13:45.535
We're sorry but we can't
let you go just yet.

13:45.536 --> 13:47.623
Why not? The Don, he said.

13:47.624 --> 13:50.937
We need you to help more ghosts
move on, so they won't squeal.

13:50.938 --> 13:53.324
All right, who?

13:53.325 --> 13:55.476
The guy we killed in the movie theater.

13:55.477 --> 13:58.526
- Don't forget about Alexander.
- And the guy from the pizza place

13:58.527 --> 14:00.646
who charge us 50 cents for
using a credit card machine...

14:00.647 --> 14:02.570
- Okay!
- Okay, okay.

14:02.571 --> 14:04.707
Okay, how many we're talking about here.

14:04.708 --> 14:07.424
Twenty. Oh, maybe 30.

14:07.425 --> 14:08.617
Thirty?

14:08.618 --> 14:10.472
Okay, are you guys nuts?

14:10.473 --> 14:12.427
I mean that would take forever.

14:12.428 --> 14:15.608
Like, wouldn't it be a
lot less work to kill me,

14:15.609 --> 14:18.826
the one guy that these
ghosts can actually talk to?

14:20.417 --> 14:23.266
I mean, am I crazy?

14:29.197 --> 14:31.449
Remember who else we buried here?

14:31.450 --> 14:33.371
The girl with the bangs from Forever 21?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.597
"No returns" girl.

14:34.598 --> 14:36.887
Dig with the knees, not with your back.

14:36.951 --> 14:38.343
What's wrong with you, man?

14:38.344 --> 14:39.634
Oh, with my knees.

14:39.635 --> 14:41.589
Oh, thanks, it's a good tip, Shaky Hands,

14:41.590 --> 14:43.345
or should I say Flaky Hands.

14:43.346 --> 14:45.003
Where have you been?

14:45.004 --> 14:47.421
All you had to do was
prove that you were dead,

14:47.422 --> 14:50.504
- and I wouldn't be in this mess.
- Who you talking to over there?

14:50.505 --> 14:54.480
- Huh?
- Nobody. Nobody.

14:54.481 --> 14:58.160
Just singing myself a little hymen A what?

14:58.161 --> 15:00.017
You know, a song you sing to God.

15:00.811 --> 15:02.931
Hymn.

15:02.932 --> 15:05.350
Yeah. Or her.

15:05.351 --> 15:06.678
Excuse me.

15:06.743 --> 15:08.432
Find me some help.

15:08.433 --> 15:11.016
- How am I supposed to do that?
- I don't know. I don't care.

15:11.017 --> 15:12.739
You want to get rid of that nickname,

15:12.740 --> 15:15.325
I am the only one who can
do that, so go find help.

15:15.326 --> 15:16.717
Figure it out. Go!

15:16.718 --> 15:18.043
Shoo! Shoo!

15:18.044 --> 15:19.998
What are you doing?

15:19.999 --> 15:22.420
I'm digging my own grave here, man!

15:31.034 --> 15:33.223
Shaky, is that you, man?

15:35.507 --> 15:37.431
Come back here.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.188
Magnus? Anders?

15:44.189 --> 15:46.642
I thought you guys had
tickets for Mamma Mia?

15:46.643 --> 15:49.394
Yes, well, the ticket
guy neglected to mention

15:49.460 --> 15:52.046
that the seats were
behind a f... king column.

15:53.569 --> 15:56.618
- Oh, Shaky, you came back for me.
- Yes!

15:58.373 --> 16:00.957
Nobody move. Hands up, hands up, man!

16:00.958 --> 16:03.112
You okay, boy?

16:03.113 --> 16:04.901
Do I look okay to you?

16:04.902 --> 16:07.055
That is just about the
most physical activity

16:07.056 --> 16:08.944
I've done maybe in my entire life.

16:08.945 --> 16:11.232
- Drop it!
- Easy now.

16:11.297 --> 16:12.489
No, no, no.

16:12.490 --> 16:13.914
Bjorn, where did you come from?

16:13.915 --> 16:17.792
I was here earlier burying my masseuse.

16:17.793 --> 16:19.913
I lost my vallet, so I'm
retracing my steps to find it.

16:19.914 --> 16:22.266
Gucci.

16:22.267 --> 16:26.437
That's an expensive gun
for a guy wearing pajamas.

16:27.436 --> 16:30.715
You know what, that gun not real

16:30.716 --> 16:31.909
and neither your accent.

16:31.910 --> 16:33.832
Vat?

16:33.833 --> 16:36.514
In Sweden, they never say "pajamas,"

16:36.515 --> 16:38.803
always "payamas."

16:38.804 --> 16:41.585
- He's right, Sievert.
- I know that.

16:41.586 --> 16:44.403
He's just trying to cause trouble.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.126
I'm as Swedish as lingonberry pie.

16:46.127 --> 16:49.573
Lingonberry pie is not
traditionally Swedish.

16:49.574 --> 16:52.721
Swedish apple pie is or rhubarb.

16:52.722 --> 16:55.105
Who are you?

16:55.106 --> 16:57.293
NYPD!

16:57.294 --> 16:59.480
Freeze, you're all under arrest!

16:59.481 --> 17:02.464
Ha! We outnumber you, Anders, kill him.

17:02.465 --> 17:05.114
Freeze... FBI!

17:05.115 --> 17:07.964
- Don't shoot, I'm CIA.
- Wait, wait!

17:07.964 --> 17:09.621
FDA!

17:09.622 --> 17:13.001
We think those meatballs
may have been horse.

17:13.002 --> 17:14.890
What's going on?

17:14.891 --> 17:18.237
Is everyone in the Swedish
Mafia an undercover cop?

17:18.238 --> 17:21.550
Guys, we really got to do
a better job communicating.

17:21.551 --> 17:25.262
Drop your guns! Now!

17:25.262 --> 17:27.117
Ow, my hair is caught in your bracelet.

17:27.118 --> 17:28.940
I have the upper hand here.

17:28.941 --> 17:31.694
I want free passage back to Sweden or I...

17:31.759 --> 17:34.643
- I kill him.
- Ow! My hair.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.287
Oh! Whoa, Melville...

17:38.288 --> 17:40.406
Don't worry, Kev. I've got a clean shot.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.024
- Have you fired a gun before?
- Hell, no.

17:43.025 --> 17:45.182
But it should be the same
as shooting a camera, right?

17:48.130 --> 17:52.505
Shake, even in death, you
can't hold a gun steady, Shake.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.894
I'm getting pretty fed up

17:53.895 --> 17:55.521
with this Shaky Hands bullshit, mothaf...

17:56.778 --> 17:59.925
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

17:59.926 --> 18:01.583
Holy...

18:01.584 --> 18:04.135
F...Mackerel.

18:04.136 --> 18:06.124
Thank you.

18:06.125 --> 18:08.575
We've been trying to take down
the Swedish Mafia for months.

18:08.576 --> 18:10.100
We couldn't have done it without your help.

18:10.101 --> 18:11.427
Good. Thanks. That's great.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.684
Can I get that tape, please?

18:12.685 --> 18:14.075
I gotta take it back to the bootleggers

18:14.076 --> 18:15.404
so I can get back to my job.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.689
I was trying to hold on to that tape

18:17.690 --> 18:19.512
because it's evidence
of a Swedish mafia hit,

18:19.513 --> 18:21.765
but it's actually just two cops

18:21.766 --> 18:25.047
murdering an innocent
Norwegian man in a theater.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.780
No! No! You didn't have to do that.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.597
Sorry, man.

18:35.585 --> 18:36.876
Why you crying?

18:36.877 --> 18:39.560
That tape was the evidence I needed to show

18:39.561 --> 18:41.581
that Shaky's hands were steady.

18:41.582 --> 18:42.907
Evidence?

18:42.908 --> 18:44.928
Man, the boy just licked
off the steadiest shot

18:44.929 --> 18:47.479
- me ever seen, yeah.
- Oh, you mean with the gun?

18:47.480 --> 18:48.806
Yes. Oh, no, that was an accident.

18:48.807 --> 18:51.161
- Ha!
- You know it, me knew

18:51.226 --> 18:53.411
Shaky still have a shaky
trigger finger, man.

18:53.412 --> 18:54.903
Come on, knock it off.

18:54.904 --> 18:56.758
Do you realize the reason
he's sticking around

18:56.759 --> 18:58.714
is because he's tired of
being called Shaky Hands?

18:58.715 --> 19:01.499
No, boy, me not make fun of him, man.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.248
Me not just give anyone some nickname.

19:04.249 --> 19:05.508
If me give you a nickname,

19:05.509 --> 19:07.397
that's because me have respect for you.

19:07.398 --> 19:09.317
Shaky, if you hearing this, man,

19:09.318 --> 19:10.978
we want you to know me miss ya.

19:11.042 --> 19:12.566
Even though you had the shakey hand,

19:12.567 --> 19:15.217
me know you always loan
me money when we need it.

19:15.218 --> 19:17.506
Much respect, bredrin.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.488
How you feel, bredrin?

19:31.489 --> 19:33.300
I need to get high.

19:33.301 --> 19:34.946
We'll go make that happen, you know.

19:34.947 --> 19:36.792
Whoo! You need a shower though.

19:36.855 --> 19:39.124
Somebody's gotta clean
up that dead Swede, right?

19:39.125 --> 19:41.664
They got to. This is New York City.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.576
Oh, no, it's not!

19:52.577 --> 19:54.093
Oh, no, we've been robbed!

19:54.157 --> 19:55.670
- We've been robbed!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

19:55.671 --> 19:57.185
- We got robbed!
- Where's the police?

19:57.186 --> 19:58.999
Aw, damn, man!

19:59.061 --> 20:00.378
Where the hell have you been?

20:00.379 --> 20:02.189
Roofie, I screwed up. I'm so sorry.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.905
I give you one job to do, one job.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.282
- I know.
- And this is how you repay me?

20:05.283 --> 20:06.699
I was supposed to be gone for one minute,

20:06.700 --> 20:08.673
and this guy came up to the newsstand,

20:08.674 --> 20:10.153
he wanted my help with a ghost.

20:10.154 --> 20:12.425
Then I got kidnapped by the Swedish mafia.

20:12.426 --> 20:13.907
They made me dig my own grave,

20:13.908 --> 20:15.192
won't let me finish my meatballs,

20:15.193 --> 20:16.708
I could've starved to death,

20:16.870 --> 20:19.013
but I did it. I did it for this.

20:22.203 --> 20:25.165
- Wow.
- It's a genuine Gucci bag.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.778
And it's for you.

20:26.779 --> 20:29.773
I just got tired of being
such a taker, you know.

20:29.774 --> 20:31.554
You're always giving me so much.

20:31.617 --> 20:33.822
And I know how much you like
Gucci 'cause you're black.

20:33.823 --> 20:35.007
We actually like Prada too.

20:35.008 --> 20:36.850
I'm so sorry, man.

20:36.851 --> 20:39.549
I can't believe the newsstand
got looted and ransacked.

20:39.550 --> 20:41.163
I... Uh, who robs a newsstand?

20:41.164 --> 20:43.763
No, the place didn't get
looted. I was messin' with you.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.334
We clear out the inventory
every week to balance the books.

20:46.397 --> 20:48.701
In fact, the place actually made money

20:48.702 --> 20:50.284
even though you weren't even here.

20:50.348 --> 20:52.057
Well, you said some guy
came to you at a newsstand,

20:52.058 --> 20:53.737
and that's how you got the ghost job?

20:53.738 --> 20:55.481
Yeah. I should've just
told him to buzz off.

20:55.482 --> 20:57.621
No. You know what...

20:57.622 --> 20:59.829
I think I've got an idea.

21:06.642 --> 21:07.925
What can I do for you, bub?

21:07.926 --> 21:09.801
So is it true you're a medium?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.007
At your service.

21:12.008 --> 21:13.192
You talk to ghosts?

21:13.193 --> 21:14.598
You bet your bottom dollar.

21:14.599 --> 21:16.209
- And you do exorcisms?
- And séances' too.

21:16.210 --> 21:18.018
I'll give you two for
one, that's a steal, pal.

21:18.019 --> 21:20.616
Cool. I'll take an Asian Sluts Quarterly.

21:20.617 --> 21:22.626
A... Asian...

21:22.627 --> 21:28.250
Sluts Quarterly. You got it.

21:28.313 --> 21:31.637
Yeah, yeah. I know... I know
where the Asian Sluts are.
