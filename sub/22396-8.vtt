00:04.832 --> 00:06.083
Hello, there.

00:06.083 --> 00:07.707
And welcome aboard the <i>ducktilus.</i>

00:08.208 --> 00:11.291
Join me as we dive 20,000 leagues

00:11.291 --> 00:13.874
to explore the wonders of the deep.

00:14.291 --> 00:16.083
Oh, boy!

00:30.124 --> 00:32.457
That's it? Wake me up
when we dock.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.416
Oh, wow!
A whale.

00:36.124 --> 00:37.124
That's a guppy.

00:37.124 --> 00:40.083
Oh, I've seen deeper
wonders in a fishbowl.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.374
Professor, I thought you said

00:42.374 --> 00:45.124
we were gonna explore
the wonders of the deep!

00:46.124 --> 00:47.374
So...

00:47.874 --> 00:50.083
You really want to see wonders?

00:51.624 --> 00:53.707
Uh-huh.
You bet, I do.

00:54.624 --> 00:57.000
Well then, what are we waiting for?

00:57.374 --> 00:58.541
Prepare to dive!

01:03.749 --> 01:05.499
A dog fish!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Mama?

01:08.333 --> 01:09.749
Oh, we can do better than that.

01:12.374 --> 01:14.083
Whoa! Tiger shark!

01:16.249 --> 01:17.832
Dive deeper.

01:20.749 --> 01:22.124
Yee-haw!

01:28.374 --> 01:30.499
I don't even know
what that is, but I love it!

01:30.874 --> 01:32.832
Wondrous enough for you?

01:32.832 --> 01:34.166
Hmm.
Actually...

01:34.166 --> 01:36.957
How about we look for some sunken ruins?

01:37.291 --> 01:39.124
Or mermaids!

01:39.749 --> 01:43.208
Or the legendary monster of the depths...

01:43.707 --> 01:46.416
The kraken!

01:53.374 --> 01:54.457
Ha-ha!

01:54.457 --> 01:55.457
Duh.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.707
Oh, my dear boy.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.083
Everybody wants to see a kraken,

02:00.416 --> 02:03.333
but the possibilities of seeing one

02:03.333 --> 02:05.249
are point zero, zero, zero...

02:08.874 --> 02:10.208
Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

02:10.957 --> 02:12.208
Great. Now,
we can go home.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.915
Aw, jeepers.

02:14.915 --> 02:16.333
- What?
<i>- Systems launch.</i>

02:19.541 --> 02:21.208
Professor!

02:21.208 --> 02:22.957
Zero, zero, zero, zero...

02:24.041 --> 02:25.666
No need to panic.

02:30.457 --> 02:32.374
Oh, what do we do without the professor?

02:32.624 --> 02:33.666
We have to get him back.

02:34.374 --> 02:36.000
Don't look at me.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.166
Mick...

02:37.166 --> 02:39.416
Maybe it's best that I watch the sub

02:39.416 --> 02:42.749
on account of I got a
c in shop in junior high.

02:45.124 --> 02:46.333
On second thought,

02:47.041 --> 02:48.624
I'm sure I read about the...

02:49.208 --> 02:51.416
Oh! Wow!

02:52.333 --> 02:55.124
Well, at least we can still explore
while we look for the professor.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.374
I have a bad feeling about this.

03:05.374 --> 03:06.541
Look!

03:06.541 --> 03:07.832
A sea slug!

03:07.832 --> 03:09.749
Cut it out! We've got
to keep moving.

03:10.416 --> 03:11.707
Aw, relax.

03:11.707 --> 03:13.208
Goofy's watching over us.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.374
Hmm.

03:19.374 --> 03:20.874
This here clock looks busted.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.707
Maybe the clam fell over this...

03:22.707 --> 03:23.915
Whoa!

03:23.915 --> 03:26.166
It's, uh, pretty dark down there.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.541
<i>Goofy, do you read me?</i>

03:30.124 --> 03:31.291
We need more light down here.

03:31.582 --> 03:32.915
Right-e-o, Mick!

03:34.291 --> 03:35.416
Thanks.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.957
A bit to the right.

03:36.957 --> 03:38.124
No, more to the left.

03:38.124 --> 03:39.624
What'd you say, Donald?

03:57.666 --> 03:59.374
Goofy! What's going on?

03:59.374 --> 04:01.374
I'm trying to turn off this clock.

04:02.457 --> 04:03.499
<i>There.</i>

04:03.915 --> 04:04.957
Ow.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.541
That's it!

04:09.541 --> 04:11.457
I'm going back to the ship!

04:11.457 --> 04:12.457
Huh?

04:12.832 --> 04:14.416
Look! There.

04:25.041 --> 04:26.249
Mermaids, Donald!

04:26.666 --> 04:28.291
Hi, ladies!

04:29.374 --> 04:31.124
Oh, uh, have you
seen a... um...

04:31.124 --> 04:32.333
Oh, okay.

04:33.124 --> 04:34.457
Oh.
Uh...

04:37.832 --> 04:39.457
<i>♪ Hold me tight</i>

04:40.291 --> 04:43.416
<i>♪ I want your arms
around me every night</i>

04:43.874 --> 04:47.874
<i>♪ I want to feel the
strength of your embrace</i> oh.

04:53.582 --> 04:54.874
Says right here

04:54.874 --> 04:58.000
that oxygen deprivation
can cause hallucinations.

04:58.416 --> 05:01.666
The language of love.

05:02.832 --> 05:04.624
What? Whoa!

05:04.915 --> 05:06.457
<i>♪ Hold me tight</i>

05:22.790 --> 05:23.915
Goofy!

05:24.874 --> 05:26.457
Who is it?

05:38.624 --> 05:40.790
What are we gonna do?

05:43.041 --> 05:44.457
I'm sorry, Donald.

05:44.457 --> 05:47.333
I wanted to explore
the wonders of the deep

05:47.582 --> 05:50.374
and now we're trapped inside one forever.

05:51.124 --> 05:52.374
This is all my fault.

05:53.249 --> 05:54.333
There, there, Mickey.

05:55.249 --> 05:57.249
It is your fault.
Huh?

06:00.666 --> 06:02.249
...zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero...

06:02.249 --> 06:03.333
Huh?

06:03.666 --> 06:05.790
It's the professor's clam!

06:05.790 --> 06:07.333
But how do we get out of here?

06:07.666 --> 06:08.541
I know!

06:08.541 --> 06:10.083
Goofy, turn on the lights.

06:10.374 --> 06:11.541
<i>Aye, aye, captain!</i>

06:16.790 --> 06:18.166
Now turn on that clock!

06:23.666 --> 06:24.749
Sorry, next time!

06:25.333 --> 06:26.333
<i>Mamma Mia!</i>

06:26.666 --> 06:28.416
Why does this keep happening to us?

06:30.374 --> 06:31.624
We're not gonna make it!

06:32.041 --> 06:33.790
We are gonna make it!

06:41.249 --> 06:43.291
Professor!

06:43.291 --> 06:45.915
...zero, zero, zero, zero,
three, four, one.

06:46.624 --> 06:49.000
Oh, great butterscotch,
there's still a chance!

06:49.374 --> 06:51.582
Who's ready to find the kraken?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Ooh, ooh, me!
