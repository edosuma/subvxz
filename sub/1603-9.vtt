said she'd rather go to jail

You want to learn something?

This is war.
Tuck in and learn.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.592
Listen up,
everyone.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.826
This morning,

09:21.828 --> 09:24.162
Beretti tried to test our heart.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.731
Now, where I'm from, someone
tries to test your heart,

09:26.733 --> 09:28.199
you take their head off.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.701
Now, the heart

09:29.703 --> 09:32.170
of Empire is its family.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.606
And like any family,
we've had our differences,

09:34.608 --> 09:36.575
but when a family
is in crisis,

09:36.577 --> 09:38.009
they put
the differences aside

09:38.011 --> 09:39.744
and they come together.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.379
So we have less

09:41.381 --> 09:43.515
than 24 hours
to assure these streets

09:43.517 --> 09:46.718
that Empire is stronger now
than it's ever been before

09:46.720 --> 09:49.287
and this family can take
whatever artists it wants

09:49.289 --> 09:50.922
and can keep the artists

09:50.924 --> 09:52.857
it has.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.993
You draw blood!

09:59.398 --> 10:01.099
I'm gonna try to sign Delphine
today, and I talked

10:01.101 --> 10:02.567
to Martina, Lowboy and Coagulation.
They're all staying

10:02.569 --> 10:04.069
at Empire-- Lowboy
wouldn't even talk to Anika.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.871
What are<i> you</i> doing
talking to Lowboy?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.807
Why wouldn't I talk to Lowboy?
He's just worrisome

10:08.809 --> 10:10.375
about artists trippin',
'cause you came out

10:10.377 --> 10:12.944
of the closet at
that White Party.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.046
It's for damn sure gonna
hurt us with Royale-T.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.314
You don't contact
Royale-T.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.716
Why don't you relax?
I don't even

10:17.718 --> 10:18.717
roll with dudes like that.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.718
Whatever happens,

10:19.720 --> 10:20.952
we don't lose Royale-T.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.621
He's a top-tier artist.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.889
Let me get at him, MC to MC.
No, no, no.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.959
Right now it's about who shows
up, son-- he's way too hood,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.462
and you got to be a real
monster to deal with him.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.130
I got you.
Where they at?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.898
They're at Ghetto Ass Studios
right now.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.001
Oh, I should have asked
before I volunteered.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.069
That place is nasty.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.170
BECKY:
Um...

10:39.172 --> 10:40.438
Where the hell is Andre?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.973
Here, let me
call him for you.

Kanye's verse with that
is going to kill.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.615
It's gonna be

11:23.617 --> 11:24.683
a monster hit, V.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.618
The first of many.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.119
(softly):
Okay.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.789
I want you to book LaChapelle
for a fashion shoot.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.357
I want the big push.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.025
Okay?
Yeah.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.494
I'm going to do more
for you in a week

11:36.496 --> 11:38.063
than Lucious did
in a year.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.564
And a year from now,

11:39.566 --> 11:41.666
everyone's gonna know your name.

11:41.668 --> 11:45.303
Thank you, Billy, so much.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.772
You're welcome.
You deserve it.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.077
Thank you.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.579
Um...

11:56.549 --> 12:00.218
I spoke to the managers
for L'il Cherry, Black Mythology

12:00.220 --> 12:03.088
and Industry, and they're all
gonna come with me to Creedmoor.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.289
How about Tiana?

12:05.658 --> 12:07.559
That's gonna be
a little bit more difficult.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.227
She was the girlfriend
of Lucious's son.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.262
That's why I want her.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.666
I can get Travie Wild. We partied
in Belize a couple months ago,

12:14.668 --> 12:16.601
and I think he in town talking
to labels or something.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.436
Yeah, then he needs
to be talking to me.

12:18.438 --> 12:22.073
I'll hit him up. Get him on the
phone, let me do the talking.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.008
LUCIOUS:
Where the hell

12:24.010 --> 12:25.910
have you been?
Delayed at the bank.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.213
We'll need enticements
for artists and managers--

12:28.215 --> 12:29.614
that's just a must--
and those auditors,

12:29.616 --> 12:31.850
those damn auditors,
they can't know

12:31.852 --> 12:34.052
it's from a cash account.
They will never catch it.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.253
I'm 100% sure

12:35.255 --> 12:36.588
of that.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.024
Yo, we're buying loyalty
with hookers and blow?

12:40.026 --> 12:41.426
That's not Empire.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.927
LUCIOUS: Now, this is
the music business,

12:42.929 --> 12:44.462
and it may take
hookers and blow

12:44.464 --> 12:46.197
to try and reclaim
some of the artists

12:46.199 --> 12:48.099
that took off after
you went prancing about

12:48.101 --> 12:49.701
with your little
freak flag.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.703
You know what?
You're right about one thing.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.972
Sexual proclivity is
what put us in this position.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.540
Your proclivity,
and the fact that

12:55.542 --> 12:57.942
you can't manage
to simply keep it in your pants.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.211
And if the creeps and the bigots
want to be over at Creedmoor,

13:00.213 --> 13:02.213
I don't give a damn, let them.
I don't want them

13:02.215 --> 13:03.581
at my company,
and neither should you.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.416
Dad, Travie.
Oh.<i> Your</i> company?

13:05.418 --> 13:07.385
You better hold on there.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.821
Travie.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.127
I miss him, too.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.763
Even after all
these years.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.232
After my son died...

13:21.234 --> 13:24.602
Lucious was the first artist
that I signed.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.172
And when he took
the money and ran,

13:27.174 --> 13:30.175
I didn't produce an album
for almost a year.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.611
I had no idea
you lost a son.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.113
Leukemia.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.248
He was nine.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.921
Tell me what I don't
know about Lucious

13:42.923 --> 13:44.956
that will help us...

13:44.958 --> 13:47.058
take him down.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.329
Is he gambling again?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.398
Doing drugs?

13:56.535 --> 13:58.169
Lucious doesn't use.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.938
Why are we even
talking about this?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.639
I'm here for the music, Billy.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.341
This isn't about the music...

14:03.343 --> 14:05.109
and you know that.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.979
Lucious hurts people
all the time,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.547
and he gets away with it.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.687
That stops now.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.957
I think that...

14:18.959 --> 14:21.826
we should keep this relationship
professional, Billy.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.562
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

Let me in there.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.406

Damn, dude, that hook was hot.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.108
Yeah, you worked that.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.910
Hey, Royale-T,
friend of mine, Cookie,

15:11.912 --> 15:13.845
wants to see you.
Cookie Lyon,

15:13.847 --> 15:15.713
as in Lucious Lyon,
as in Empire--

15:15.715 --> 15:18.616
your label. Cookie
Lyon, Empire.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.951
Are you really doing this,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.587
hanging with these roaches
from Creedmoor?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.889
You see, T, that's the problem
with these thots, man.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.592
(others laugh) They don't know
how to let men drink in peace.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.761
I only see one man
in here...

15:29.763 --> 15:32.263
and he's been happy
and prosperous at Empire.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.698
Am I right?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.367
I could be happy a lot
of places, Cookie.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.069
Why don't you let G's
do what they do?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.971
And then you come back
when it's time to clean up.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.873
You ain't no G.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.608
You's a mark.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.777
I did 17 years in the feds.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.947
I know a buster
when I see one. Mark.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.049
Oh, so you did time, huh?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.617
Yep.
Look at that.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.786
Mixin' pruno in my cell--

15:54.788 --> 15:57.288

16:00.827 --> 16:02.293

16:02.295 --> 16:05.630
(others laugh, chatter)
Oh, yeah? Well...

16:05.632 --> 16:07.332
let's see who goes harder,

16:07.334 --> 16:08.900
Empire...

16:08.902 --> 16:10.902

16:33.326 --> 16:35.626
Thank you. That was
really, really strong.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.628
Thank you. Oh.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.863
Jamal's here.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.031
Come on.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.632
(chuckles)
Hi!

16:41.634 --> 16:44.135
Oh, no.
Hello!

16:44.137 --> 16:45.937
I'm a big fan.
Oh,

16:45.939 --> 16:48.039
the feeling
is so, so mutual.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.875
I am so honored to meet
the amazing Ms. Delphine.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.211
Thank you, thank you.
I mean, what you did,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.646
coming out to the whole
world at the White Party,

16:55.648 --> 16:57.815
singing your dad's song,
that was amazing.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.984
Thank you. Nah, Lucious
must have loved it.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.486
Uh... no.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.954
(laughs)

17:02.956 --> 17:05.390
But, I mean, yes and...
Mm,

17:05.392 --> 17:06.858
are you ready
to do this?

17:06.860 --> 17:09.193
Get him some headphones.
We're gonna sing this song.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.162
We can do this.  Come on.
We gonna do this, then.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.997
We're gonna do this. Take off that coat!
Come on!

17:12.999 --> 17:16.300
Travie, there's not
a more artist-focused label

17:16.302 --> 17:17.902
than the Empire.

17:17.904 --> 17:21.572
No, no, no, no. It's
not about your label.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.241
It's that you're a label
at all. I mean,

17:23.243 --> 17:24.809
the Internet killed you;
you know that, right?

17:24.811 --> 17:26.177
You know I can't give you 30%

17:26.179 --> 17:28.579
when I can release
my stuff online.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.748
You're old.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.417
You're dying.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.218
Then why'd you take
this meeting, Travie?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.520
Like I told Hakeem,

17:35.522 --> 17:37.088
I respect your dad.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.323
Back in the day,
you changed the game.

17:39.325 --> 17:42.093
I just wanted to shake
your hand. But look, man,

17:42.095 --> 17:43.995
I'm done sharecropping,
all right?

17:43.997 --> 17:47.231
Paying for your fancy offices
and your private jets.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.933
Well, you're right,
you're absolutely right.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.769
And the main reason that we
are taking the Empire public

17:51.771 --> 17:53.704
is to give the artist
an opportunity

17:53.706 --> 17:55.073
to be back in control

17:55.075 --> 17:57.375
of the music again,
and to participate

17:57.377 --> 17:59.444
in the profits of it.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.112
You won't be robbed by
streaming services, Travie,

18:01.114 --> 18:02.380
because you're
not going to need

18:02.382 --> 18:04.582
streaming services.
The Empire catalogue

18:04.584 --> 18:06.617
is going to be
its own streaming service--

18:06.619 --> 18:09.087
a joint venture
with our artists.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.222
But that's just one
component of our model--

18:11.224 --> 18:13.624
a new paradigm.
You see, music...

18:13.626 --> 18:15.126
isn't the cargo anymore, my man.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.295
It's the track,
and faster than ever.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.696
Right?

18:18.698 --> 18:21.099
Literally, the speed
of light. Every car

18:21.101 --> 18:23.634
on the train is another
exploitation of<i> your</i> brand--

18:23.636 --> 18:26.404
concerts, endorsements--
and you're an equity partner,

18:26.406 --> 18:29.040
in everything. Can't no other
label do this, man.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.242
Not one. Why?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.643
Because we...

18:32.645 --> 18:34.145
are independent.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.614
I'm not paying you 30%.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.749
Brother, we can cut that in half
and both make more money.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.352
A lot of money.
(Lucious laughing)

18:42.588 --> 18:45.123
ANDRE: Yeah? You know
what I'm saying? Right?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.158
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money...
Thank you, Dre.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.594
Thank you, Dre. Thank you.
Your brother's a smart guy.

18:49.596 --> 18:53.064
Yeah, and he's gonna make us
a<i> lot</i> of money.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.967
I like the sound
of that, Lucious.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.236
Mm.
My people will call you.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.138
Good man. Thank you.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.206
Good man.
All right.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.245
HAKEEM: I'll show you out.
(sighs)

19:07.247 --> 19:08.980
(line ringing)

19:08.982 --> 19:11.282
LUCIOUS (recorded):
Yo, what up? This is Lucious.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.684
Dad, Dad, I'm still up here
with Delphine.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.653
Let's get her at Empire.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.323
I'm telling you,
we could do this. Call me back.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.193

Hey.
Mm?

I'm the last man
standing.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.720

But you ain't...
you-you ain't a man, though.

22:39.459 --> 22:42.293
And you ain't standing,
neither. You...

22:42.295 --> 22:43.861
Well...

22:43.863 --> 22:46.597
You ain't gonna
leave us, is you?

22:49.468 --> 22:52.002
All right, look,
I-I'll tell you what,

22:52.004 --> 22:54.372
I'll tell you what.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.408
If you... if you could walk
after that next shot...

22:57.410 --> 22:59.577
or round... then
I'm gonna stay at Empire,

22:59.579 --> 23:02.413
and we gonna be a family.
All right, hit me. Come on.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.049
I'll get it.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.419
Stir this up
a little bit.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.422
Mm-hmm.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.024
Mm... (sniffs)

23:15.895 --> 23:17.194

(both laugh)

23:58.370 --> 24:02.273
(hits piano keys) I got
it, I got it. Yeah.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.741
Why you go off
on Andre like that

24:03.743 --> 24:05.943
and make me sit there like
your little pet dog?

24:05.945 --> 24:09.213
Instead of treating me like the man
that's gonna run Empire someday, huh?

24:09.215 --> 24:11.482
Dad, I'm literally in the studio
right now with Delphine.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.117
Her contract is up
after this album,

24:13.119 --> 24:15.252
and I talked her
into meeting with you tonight.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.988
So call me back,
'cause we can do this.

24:21.092 --> 24:22.593
(sighs)

24:22.595 --> 24:25.296
Why do you think I picked you

24:25.298 --> 24:30.301
to be the one who
watches and learns firsthand?

24:31.736 --> 24:35.406
I'm handing you
the baton.

24:35.408 --> 24:38.309
But I'm not doing that until
I know you can run like the wind

24:38.311 --> 24:39.844
and can handle it.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.246
(Cookie groans softly, mumbles)

24:43.748 --> 24:45.616
COOKIE:
What was I thinking, hey,

24:45.618 --> 24:47.685
hanging out with these kids?

24:47.687 --> 24:49.687
(mumbling)

24:50.789 --> 24:52.323
(yelling)

24:58.363 --> 25:00.698
Yeah! Yeah!

25:00.700 --> 25:02.433
COOKIE:
Now what, bitch?!

25:02.435 --> 25:06.103
That's what happens
when you mess with Cookie!

25:06.105 --> 25:07.505
You okay?

25:07.507 --> 25:09.440
Oh, what you doing here?

25:09.442 --> 25:12.376
You know, this is
a bad neighborhood.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.612
Aw, you worried about me?

25:14.614 --> 25:16.180
I'm fine.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.882
So are you.
Cookie, come on.

25:17.884 --> 25:21.151
Yeah, that's my name--
take a bite.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.887
You know I got
rules, right?

25:22.889 --> 25:25.022
Oh, man, break
the rules!

25:25.024 --> 25:27.057
Rules are made
to be broken.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.393
Don't follow the rules.
Look, Lucious is my boss,

25:29.395 --> 25:31.562
and he's still
in love with you.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.664
COOKIE (slurring): Lucious,
Lucious, Lucious, Lucious.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.232
You okay?

25:35.234 --> 25:38.369
Lucious don't care
about nobody but hisself.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.371
Well, it's my job
to study people.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.006
Study me.
Watch yourself.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.408
And the way he looks at you...
(mock groaning)

25:44.410 --> 25:46.143
whatever that is,
that's too intense.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.745
So you're off limits to me.

25:47.747 --> 25:50.915
Aw, come on,
take these cookies.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.717
Take 'em. I won't tell.
Come on, Cookie.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.853
Take these cookies!

25:55.855 --> 25:57.555
All right.
All right.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.059
Lucious! Lucious!

26:02.061 --> 26:03.827
Lucious, Travie Wild
is with Beretti.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.231
He just sent him his private jet
to go to Heathrow.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.066
No, that's impossible.
I have a source.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.877
Look, I don't need you to follow
me around like a lost puppy.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.113
You want to help me, find your
brother Andre! I need that cash.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.015
Yeah, but how he gonna have
Travie Wild and then lose him?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.383
You know, it's like,
what the hell's going on?

26:26.385 --> 26:27.618
But where is Dre?

26:27.620 --> 26:29.420
Dad is looking for him.
Did he even

26:29.422 --> 26:30.754
hear my voice mail
about Delphine?

26:34.559 --> 26:36.894
Fool, Dad
looking for you.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.863
What are you talking about?
What's this?

26:39.865 --> 26:43.200
Picking up the new car, brother.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.768
Lamborghini.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.571
Have to wine and dine our
artists in style, right?

26:47.573 --> 26:49.440
That's my job.
You do know that's my job,

26:49.442 --> 26:51.609
to wine and dine the artists
in style? That's what I do--

26:51.611 --> 26:53.377
I take care of everybody.
You bought a new car?

26:53.379 --> 26:54.478
With the slush fund money?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.879
Eh...
Dad want

26:55.881 --> 26:57.281
that money, and he
looking for you.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.616
You gonna be in big trouble.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.585
Oh, don't you worry
about Andre, baby brother.

27:01.587 --> 27:04.788
Andre is good. (kissing)
Yo! Stop, man!

27:04.790 --> 27:06.457
Come on with that
gay stuff, man.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.258
(Andre yells)
HAKEEM: Yo!

27:08.260 --> 27:09.293
What the hell's
wrong with you!

27:09.295 --> 27:10.761
Why would you
do that, man?

27:10.763 --> 27:12.062
JAMAL:
What the hell's wrong with you!

27:12.064 --> 27:14.331
Why would you do that?
Hey, get off me, man.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.133
Get off!
Dre! Dre!

27:16.135 --> 27:17.801
(loud clattering)
Get off him!

27:17.803 --> 27:19.770
HAKEEM: What's that? What's that?
Get off him!

27:19.772 --> 27:21.105
Hold on, what's that?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.473
We're stuck.
Hold up.

27:24.509 --> 27:27.578
Hang on, hang on.
No service, man!

27:27.580 --> 27:28.846
Chill.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.015
I-I... we-we
could just give it away.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.149
(pants)

27:32.151 --> 27:33.851
Come on.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.486
I can explain the car.
It-it has value.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.121
Uh, uh... if we give it
to somebody,

27:37.123 --> 27:38.656
then... then they'll take it.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.357
Then that's what we'll do.
They'll take it

27:40.359 --> 27:42.459
if we give it to some...
and Dad doesn't have to know.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.595
Dad doesn't have to know.
Well, Dre, we get it, man.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.864
No, Andre got this.
We'll-we'll-we'll It's all right.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.432
give it away,
Andre'll give it away.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.000
He can take over anything;
he's sharp.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.136
(snapping fingers)
Dre...

27:52.138 --> 27:53.237
we cool, all right?

28:13.024 --> 28:14.858
BILLY:
Too late, Lucious.

28:18.663 --> 28:21.532
So you bought yourself
another punk-ass rock star,

28:21.534 --> 28:23.801
but you'll never
have any talent.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.369
I'll produce all the hits,

28:25.371 --> 28:27.471
but the artists
will be the stars.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.474
That's what you hate about us,
and that's your tragedy.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.676
Your tragedy talks
in her sleep.

28:32.678 --> 28:34.378
She mumbles your name.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.613
(men speak indistinctly)

28:50.762 --> 28:53.831
I got what I needed from her,
and I got rid of her.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.966
Oops, I think I did
that to you, too.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.306
This doesn't
happen here.

29:03.708 --> 29:07.778
You know, I used
to pity you...

29:07.780 --> 29:10.581
when you first
lost your son.

29:13.718 --> 29:15.919
You're beyond pity.

29:15.921 --> 29:20.324
You and that punk Travie
Wild deserve each other.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.074
MALCOLM: <i> The elevator's</i>
<i> not a malfunction.</i>

29:37.076 --> 29:38.776
<i> We're being hacked</i>
<i> from the 18th floor.</i>

29:38.778 --> 29:40.444
Elevators, phone, Internet.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.746
Reprogram Delta.
I'm on my way.

29:42.748 --> 29:45.382
(quietly):
No, no, he'll never see me,

29:45.384 --> 29:47.317
not like he sees you.

29:47.319 --> 29:50.721
No matter what I do,
he'll never see me, man. God!

29:50.723 --> 29:52.422
Andre, just chill,
man. Please.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.590
Oh, you got no idea!

29:53.592 --> 29:54.658
Dre.
You weren't even there

29:54.660 --> 29:55.726
when it was really hard!

29:55.728 --> 29:56.927
When we were kids

29:56.929 --> 29:57.728
and that struggle

29:57.730 --> 29:58.996
was pitch black,

29:58.998 --> 30:00.597
it was only me!

30:00.599 --> 30:02.699
Me! Me!

30:05.570 --> 30:07.304
You were babies!

30:08.239 --> 30:09.740
Dre, we were babies.

30:09.742 --> 30:11.842
I worked harder
than anybody up in here.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.177
I made Empire!

30:13.179 --> 30:14.678
8:00 to 10:00!

30:14.680 --> 30:17.748
8:00 to 10:00!
8:00 to 10:00!

30:17.750 --> 30:19.316
Every day!

30:19.318 --> 30:21.852
I'd go home and work!

30:21.854 --> 30:25.289
Dre, 'cause we just...
yeah, 'cause we were babies.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.124
Remember-remember when we
were kids and there'd be

30:27.126 --> 30:28.792
shots outside,
or Aunt Carol acting crazy,

30:28.794 --> 30:30.961
