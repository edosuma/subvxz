our parents will never let us

about style, right.

your very first Gauntlet outfit.

I'm definitely not wearing overalls.

Please take them back. Please.

They say if you keep it tight up top,

Who says that about overalls?

and sacrifice an animal,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.875
who volunteers to clean up shits
in the chem lab date his daughter?

09:27.875 --> 09:29.667
No! He wants a man!

09:30.542 --> 09:32.000
Come on now.
Gotta you show you the closer.

09:33.292 --> 09:33.958
‐ The closer?

09:33.958 --> 09:36.375
‐ So you know my senior shop project
I told you I was working on?

09:36.375 --> 09:38.375
‐ Yeah, man, the one you had
the GoFundMe for

09:38.375 --> 09:40.292
when you were building
the reusable hydration systems

09:40.292 --> 09:41.250
for third world countries.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.917
I was really proud of you for doing that.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.833
‐ Yeah, man, fuck hydration. I lied.
I put that money to much better use.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.500
‐ I donated $75.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.833
‐ Griffin, I give to you the most
important invention since the toilet,

09:50.833 --> 09:52.542
[tarp rustling]
The BoozeCycle!

09:53.250 --> 09:56.000
‐ Whoa, man. You built this?
‐ Yeah, man.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.792
‐ This is awesome.

09:57.792 --> 09:58.708
‐ Isn't it great?

09:58.708 --> 10:01.125
‐ Imagine if you put your mind
to something useful.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.792
‐ Useful? This is the most
useful thing I've ever done.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.083
Is it a car? Kind of.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.167
Is it a bicycle? Almost.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.792
Griffin, this thing fucks!

10:09.792 --> 10:11.583
‐ I mean, it does. It's really cool.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.667
It's just, how would we even pedal it
with two people? There's ten seats.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.333
‐ Hey, why you gotta be so negative, bro?

10:18.333 --> 10:21.792
<i>‐ And El Pantera, that's just a myth.</i>
<i>Like Santa Claus.</i>

10:21.792 --> 10:24.208
GRIFFIN: You know what <i>,</i> man. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be a Debbie downer.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.542
I'm just‐‐ I'm nervous, you know.
Aren't you scared? Like, at all?

10:27.542 --> 10:29.542
‐ Scared of what? Becoming a legend?

10:29.542 --> 10:31.625
‐ No, of just‐‐ I don't know. Everything.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.958
Lena, Carlsen, alcohol poisoning,

10:33.958 --> 10:35.875
our lives turning into a musical.

10:35.875 --> 10:36.708
That sounds terrible.

10:36.708 --> 10:39.792
‐ Griffin, we'll be fine. I'll be
with you every step of the way.

10:39.792 --> 10:40.875
‐ That's what I'm scared about.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.708
‐ Ha ha. Oh, okay, you make jokes,

10:42.708 --> 10:44.292
but you don't realize that
I'm a human, with emotion,

10:44.292 --> 10:45.292
and it hurts my feelings.

10:45.292 --> 10:47.083
‐ I love you, okay. I really do.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.000
And I appreciate you
getting me a wristband

10:49.000 --> 10:51.208
and stealing from all those people
who desperately need clean water

10:51.208 --> 10:52.250
to build a BoozeCycle‐‐

10:52.250 --> 10:53.292
‐ Which is awesome.
‐ It is,

10:53.292 --> 10:54.958
but I'm just gonna stick to tradition,

10:54.958 --> 10:57.625
do Root Beer Goat‐Night with our parents,
and wake up tomorrow

10:57.625 --> 11:00.333
to continue my extended reign
as mayor of Virgin City.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.708
‐ Good to know, Mr. Mayor!

11:02.250 --> 11:03.958
‐ Lena! Hey.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.750
‐ Lena, please don't call him Mr. Mayor.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.083
Mr. Mayor is his father.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.667
I like to refer to my brother here
as <i>Babe: Pig In The City.</i>

11:09.667 --> 11:11.833
‐ Hmm.
‐ Because he's got
the thickest hog in the game.

11:11.833 --> 11:12.375
‐ That's not‐‐

11:12.375 --> 11:14.375
‐ I've never once heard anyone
refer to him as Babe,

11:14.375 --> 11:15.875
and I've known him since preschool.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.000
‐ That's 'cause they whisper it to him.
‐ They don't do that.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.833
They don't whisper anything.

11:18.833 --> 11:22.083
‐ So, you whisper "Babe"
into Griffin's ear

11:22.083 --> 11:24.083
because he has
the thickest hog in the game?

11:26.500 --> 11:29.250
‐ Okay, Lena. This is weird now.
Right? So I'm gonna go.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.708
Lena. Babe.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.000
‐ I have a normal‐sized hog,

11:37.375 --> 11:39.500
probably no different than the next one.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.000
Not that I've seen,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.417
uh, but naturally you do find yourself
in positions where you see other hogs

11:45.417 --> 11:47.625
and in those situations, I found that...

11:48.208 --> 11:49.333
my hog is...

11:50.250 --> 11:52.042
comparable, if not the same

11:52.583 --> 11:53.875
in thickness to those‐‐

11:54.250 --> 11:55.500
‐ That's good to know.

11:56.417 --> 11:59.708
Um... so are you gonna Binge?

12:00.417 --> 12:02.042
‐ After your dad's speech?

12:02.042 --> 12:04.333
You'd have to be a certified dip‐shit
to go out tonight.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.542
‐ Well, I guess I'm the mayor
of Dip‐Shit City

12:06.542 --> 12:08.708
'cause I'm seriously thinking about it.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.375
‐ Me too, by the way.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.417
I was completely joking before
about the dip‐shit thing. That's‐‐

12:14.083 --> 12:15.167
But, um...

12:17.125 --> 12:19.000
‐ Griff, is everything okay?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.375
‐ It is. Uh‐‐

12:23.208 --> 12:25.375
You know how our moms used
to go to Zumba class together?

12:25.375 --> 12:28.958
‐ Yeah! Yeah, we used to play
fake house in the kid's room.

12:28.958 --> 12:32.500
To this day, no one makes
fake French toast as good as you.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.792
‐ And no one did our fake taxes for
our fake mortgage better than you, so‐‐

12:35.792 --> 12:37.000
‐ And now we're fake home owners!

12:37.333 --> 12:39.292
‐ That fake debt collector
won't stop hounding me!

12:39.292 --> 12:41.458
[laughing]

12:41.458 --> 12:44.167
Um, anyways, I was just thinking how

12:44.167 --> 12:45.417
we've always been in each other's lives.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.750
‐ Yeah.
‐ And, um,

12:47.750 --> 12:48.750
Lena, I was wondering if‐‐

12:48.750 --> 12:49.875
[Lena shrieks]

12:49.875 --> 12:50.792
‐ Oh my god!

12:50.792 --> 12:52.333
What is this?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.708
"This promposal you can't ignore,

12:54.708 --> 12:56.083
"because there's still so much more.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.875
"Let's laugh and be merry,
because the next clue you'll find

12:57.875 --> 12:58.917
"at the Carnegie Library!

12:58.917 --> 13:01.250
Here's hoping you will attend,
and while you're at it, bring a friend!"

13:01.250 --> 13:02.292
Holy shit!

13:02.875 --> 13:05.667
Griffin, did you do this?

13:06.208 --> 13:07.083
‐ Um‐‐

13:08.417 --> 13:09.792
‐ Are you kidding me? Oh my god!

13:09.792 --> 13:11.250
When did this happen
and why didn't you tell me?

13:11.250 --> 13:14.250
‐ No, no, no, it is happening right now.
You are witnessing it.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.625
‐ This is awesome.
‐ Who do you think did it?

13:15.625 --> 13:18.042
‐ I don't know! Um, Max Keiser?

13:18.042 --> 13:19.417
‐ Maybe it was Ian Greenstein?

13:19.417 --> 13:20.875
‐ Ian Greenstein? Yeah, he‐‐

13:20.875 --> 13:22.708
He liked your tweet 18 months ago
like a total creep.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.167
I bet it's Ian Greenstein.
‐ So many guys!

13:24.167 --> 13:25.542
‐ I know!
‐ Exciting.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.792
‐ Holy shit! This is huge. They sold out
for this, like, six months ago.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.875
‐ Griffin, would you be
the ultimate friend and take a pic?

13:31.875 --> 13:32.833
‐ Totally.
‐ Thank you!

13:32.833 --> 13:34.208
‐ Yeah, I can do that.
‐ Thank you!

13:35.250 --> 13:36.875
‐ Say "Ian Greenstein.'

13:36.875 --> 13:38.542
BOTH: Ian Greenstein!

13:38.542 --> 13:39.792
‐ You guys are gonna really like that.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.125
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Of course.

13:42.583 --> 13:44.708
So that's‐‐ So‐‐
LENA: Okay, bye, Griffin.

13:45.375 --> 13:46.667
BECKY: Who do you think did this?

13:47.375 --> 13:49.417
[girls giggling]

13:52.500 --> 13:54.292
SARAH: The package
is basically fully stocked

13:54.292 --> 13:56.875
with, like, colorful frozen drinks
and tiny umbrellas.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.583
‐ I fucking love tiny umbrellas.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.333
Do you think pink drinks, too, because

14:00.333 --> 14:03.000
[blowing trombone]
my grandmother's seen this show,
it's called <i>Sex and the City,</i>

14:03.000 --> 14:06.417
and they would just drink pink alcohol
and have meaningless sex

14:06.417 --> 14:08.833
with strangers of foreign descent.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.833
‐ I would do disgusting things
to a foreign guy tonight.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.500
‐ Hmm.
‐ I'm talking full spit roast.

14:12.875 --> 14:13.792
[clattering]

14:13.792 --> 14:15.958
[students shouting]

14:15.958 --> 14:17.167
HAGS: Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

14:17.167 --> 14:18.792
‐ Hags, what the hell is wrong with you?

14:18.792 --> 14:22.625
‐ I'm so sorry, I just dropped my passport
somewhere around here earlier today.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.167
I'm just trying to get right back
to the motherland right after I graduate.

14:26.542 --> 14:27.583
BOTH: What?

14:28.417 --> 14:29.375
‐ Oh, my homeland.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.958
You know I'm
a hundred percent foreign, right?

14:30.958 --> 14:32.000
Like, from another place.

14:32.917 --> 14:37.125
Ha ha. Anyhoo, will I be seeing
you ladies at the Library Party tonight?

14:37.125 --> 14:38.917
‐ You're going to the Library Party?

14:38.917 --> 14:40.792
‐ Hell yeah I'm going
to the Library Party.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.958
And I'm hoping that you'll check me out.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.917
‐ For what purpose?
‐ Excuse me.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.708
‐ Uh, isn't that a saying?

14:47.083 --> 14:49.292
‐ No, it's not.
Words have consequences, Hags.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.042
‐ Okay, that's what it is.
It's the language barrier thing.

14:52.042 --> 14:53.583
That's what... that's what it was.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.292
Because I'm from another place.
I'm fully foreign.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.708
‐ Have you ever even been on a plane?

14:58.708 --> 15:00.583
‐ Hell yeah I've been on a plane.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.000
Ha ha. Of course.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.833
I'm actually a current cardholder
of the mile high club.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.500
‐ Oh yeah?
‐ And the big dick club.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.500
‐ [gasps] Really?
HAGS: Mm‐hmm.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.958
‐ Well, why don't you whip it out
and show us?

15:09.958 --> 15:11.833
‐ Mmm. You see, I would,

15:12.833 --> 15:15.083
but they keep the band room real cold.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.292
It's not really a accurate depiction
of my genitalia.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.042
BOTH: Hmm.

15:18.042 --> 15:18.917
‐ That's what I thought.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.083
Virgin.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.833
This is dry.
‐ Okay.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.208
CARLSEN: Chad, how are we?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.333
Kurt, how come I never see you
with your shorts off?

15:27.333 --> 15:28.750
Seem a little locker room shy.
‐ KURT: S‐‐ Sir‐‐

15:28.750 --> 15:30.083
‐ Wanna see how a man walks around
the locker room?

15:30.083 --> 15:31.500
KURT: Um‐‐
‐ Wanna take a look at it?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.833
I'll pull my pants down, I'll go take
a shit, I'll get in the shower.

15:33.833 --> 15:34.583
You wanna watch it?

15:34.583 --> 15:37.333
Whatever it is, get comfortable with it.
It ain't going away.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.125
Let's get behind those ears,
okay, Bennett?

15:39.125 --> 15:40.792
BENNETT: Yes, sir.
‐ That's where the germs live
and they reproduce.

15:40.792 --> 15:41.917
BENNETT: Got it.
‐ Don't be a pussy.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.917
Chin up. Griffin, my man, how are you?

15:43.917 --> 15:44.958
‐ How's it going, Principal Carlsen?

15:44.958 --> 15:47.667
‐ Well, I'm always a little bit on edge
when it comes to Binge night,

15:47.667 --> 15:49.625
people get pushed to their moral limits.
‐ Me too.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.375
I, I can't believe people Binge.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.250
‐ One shake and you're done, Tommy!

15:53.250 --> 15:54.875
No one wants to watch
your dickplay in here.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.667
At your age, you're a hair‐trigger.
You're liable to blow all over the place.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.958
Have a story about you for the rest
of your life. You want that?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.125
Put the dick down.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.042
TOMMY: Okay.

16:03.042 --> 16:05.875
‐ You know, Griffin, uh, Lena says
some really nice things about you.

16:06.542 --> 16:07.125
‐ She does?

16:07.125 --> 16:09.250
‐ Yeah. She says that you're nice,
that you work hard,

16:09.250 --> 16:11.667
that you have
pretty terrific table manners.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.667
You know, I'll tell you, Griff,

16:14.125 --> 16:17.583
I'm pretty okay
with... my daughter being friends

16:17.583 --> 16:19.417
with a nice Brown man.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.792
Let me walk that back just a little bit.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.792
That's not the kind of quote
that you want taken out of context.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.292
Congratulations on getting into
a great university, Brown.

16:30.292 --> 16:32.958
‐ Thank you, sir. And thank you again
for making that call to Dean Eckhouse.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.000
It really made all the difference.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.417
‐ Well, Griff, you know,
when you have a history of

16:36.417 --> 16:38.458
recommending
outstanding guys, like yourself,

16:38.458 --> 16:40.042
they tend to listen to you.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.875
And by the same token, if you ask them
to rescind someone they're thinking about,

16:42.875 --> 16:45.000
they go ahead and they listen loud
and clear on that as well.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.542
Since we're talking
about scratching each other's backs,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.542
I have just the smallest little itch

16:51.542 --> 16:53.500
I was wondering if you could get
your fingernails on.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.625
It's called where the fuck
is the party tonight?

16:56.625 --> 17:00.875
Sarah Martin's "Dank‐Ass Pre‐Game"
is already on my radar.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.375
I understand they're thinking
of smoking a little bit of pot.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.625
Maybe some Lean? A little Purple Drank.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.375
You know what I'm talking about?
‐ Oh, I do, but I wouldn't.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.375
I personally wouldn't sniff glue
or drink Purple Drank

17:10.375 --> 17:12.041
or just associate
with Sarah Martin at all.

17:12.041 --> 17:12.791
‐ Well, that's good.

17:12.791 --> 17:14.208
That bitch has chaotic energy.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.791
She's like a scorpion in a toaster.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.416
Anyway, the point is
if you hear of anything‐‐

17:20.416 --> 17:21.291
‐ Of course.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.000
‐ Fair?
‐ Totally fair.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.875
‐ Fair?
‐ Fair. Very fair.

17:25.875 --> 17:26.750
[wristband clicks]

17:27.125 --> 17:28.208
‐ The hell is‐‐

17:32.542 --> 17:35.000
‐ Principal Carlsen, I‐‐ Um‐‐

17:35.500 --> 17:38.083
[clears throat]
It's a funny story, I‐‐ Uh‐‐

17:38.083 --> 17:40.375
[clears throat] I‐‐
‐ Oh.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.917
Oh. Actually, Principal Carlsen,
that's not Griffin's.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.333
No, see, I found that in the hallway,

17:46.333 --> 17:48.500
and I gave it to Griffin
to hold onto it for me.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.417
Yeah, I just had no idea what it was.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.000
Could it be tickets
to a renaissance fair or...

17:53.667 --> 17:54.625
a petting zoo.

17:56.750 --> 17:57.833
GRIFFIN: Yeah.

17:57.833 --> 17:59.167
‐ You gentlemen be safe tonight.

17:59.167 --> 17:59.917
‐ Yes, sir.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.542
‐ And Hags, do me a favor.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.708
Try to find a nickname
that's a little bit more normal.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.375
Something like Lucas or Quan.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.167
I'll see you Tuesday? Thirty minutes?

18:09.167 --> 18:11.125
Thank you, Quan. Griff.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.208
David, thank your brother
for the meatloaf.

18:15.208 --> 18:15.833
DAVID: Yes, sir.

18:16.583 --> 18:17.917
‐ Whoa, thank Christ.

18:17.917 --> 18:18.792
CARLSEN: Oh, Griffin?
‐ Yup.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.000
‐ You know, there's a prank turd
in the chemistry lab.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.583
I was wondering if you could be an angel,
sweep in and scoop that up.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.583
‐ I would love to do that.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.417
‐ Thank you, Quan.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.458
[door opens, closes]

18:32.125 --> 18:34.417
‐ Fuck! Quan?

18:34.417 --> 18:35.875
Who the fuck is Quan?

18:35.875 --> 18:38.042
[school bell rings]

18:38.042 --> 18:40.917
FREEMAN VOICE: <i>And so it begins.</i>
[students chattering excitedly]

18:40.917 --> 18:44.042
<i>As school lets out, sirens pierce the air,</i>
[siren wailing]

18:44.042 --> 18:48.000
<i>informing the civilian population</i>
<i>of what's to come.</i>

18:48.000 --> 18:50.417
<i>For some, a warning.</i>

18:50.417 --> 18:53.042
<i>To those not participating, to get home,</i>

18:53.042 --> 18:56.208
<i>bunker down, and pray for safety.</i>

18:56.583 --> 18:59.583
<i>For others, it's the sound of celebration,</i>

18:59.583 --> 19:01.667
<i>excess, freedom.</i>

19:02.708 --> 19:05.542
<i>Underground competitions</i>
<i>known as Gauntlets</i>

19:05.542 --> 19:07.375
<i>capture the nation's attention.</i>

19:07.833 --> 19:10.958
<i>Creating local legends in those who win</i>

19:10.958 --> 19:14.417
<i>and lasting memories for all who compete.</i>

19:14.417 --> 19:16.583
ALL: Ten, nine

19:16.583 --> 19:18.917
eight, seven, six,

19:18.917 --> 19:21.167
five, four,

19:21.167 --> 19:23.875
three, two, one!

19:23.875 --> 19:26.208
‐ Yahtzee!
[laughter]

19:26.208 --> 19:27.208
Whoo!

19:27.708 --> 19:28.667
Yeah.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.875
‐ Oh. To our sixth Binge Night Game Night!

19:31.875 --> 19:33.375
‐ Yep.
‐ What a great tradition!

19:33.375 --> 19:34.375
‐ This is fun.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.667
‐ It's just great being able to hang
with family on the night

19:36.667 --> 19:38.583
when nobody else is doing
anything awesome.

19:38.583 --> 19:42.000
‐ Oh, and we are just grateful
that you boys would rather‐‐

19:42.000 --> 19:44.292
‐ Uh... men!
CHESTER: Excuse me.

19:44.292 --> 19:46.125
That you <i>men</i>

19:46.125 --> 19:50.292
would still rather pal around
with us middle <i>‐</i> aged fogies

19:50.292 --> 19:53.167
than go out drinking with all
the other high school boys and girls.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.292
‐ Yeah, well, makes me hopeful
for the future.

19:55.292 --> 19:57.458
‐ Yep.
‐ Well, who's ready for round two?

19:58.042 --> 19:58.917
‐ Yeah.

19:58.917 --> 19:59.875
‐ We don't have to do
the thing again, Dad.

19:59.875 --> 20:00.917
We don't‐‐
CHESTER: Oh no, let's do it.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.583
Root beer goat!
‐ Ha ha!

20:02.583 --> 20:04.458
[all bleating]

20:06.458 --> 20:08.125
‐ Ah, somebody didn't goat.

20:08.125 --> 20:08.583
[gasps]

20:08.583 --> 20:09.958
‐ Well, everybody goated so I‐‐

20:09.958 --> 20:11.542
‐ Come on, son, you do the best goat.

20:11.542 --> 20:12.625
‐ I do a very normal goat.
‐ No, you‐‐

20:12.625 --> 20:14.125
‐ Come on, give us a goat!

20:14.125 --> 20:15.792
Give us a goat!
‐ You're so good.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.333
[high‐pitched bleating]

20:17.333 --> 20:18.792
[laughter]
STACY: You got it.

20:18.792 --> 20:19.958
‐ This is what I'm talking about.

20:19.958 --> 20:21.417
‐ That's a damn good goat!

20:22.250 --> 20:25.083
So, Griffin, I heard you're going to prom
with the Principal's daughter?

20:25.083 --> 20:26.042
GRIFFIN: Oh.
PAUL: Prom.

20:26.042 --> 20:28.708
‐ Yeah, I, I was,
but somebody else already asked.

20:28.708 --> 20:29.875
[sympathetic groans]

20:29.875 --> 20:31.292
‐ That's too bad.
KARYN: I'm so sorry.

20:31.292 --> 20:32.458
‐ Oh, it's okay, Ma.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.292
Most, most people
probably don't even remember

20:34.292 --> 20:35.250
who they went to prom with.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.083
‐ Exactly.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.708
‐ Unh‐unh, you're looking at him.

20:38.792 --> 20:42.250
He was so nervous when he asked me.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.583
He had written a little poem out
and everything.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.167
He didn't even end up reading it.

20:47.042 --> 20:48.917
‐ Well, for what it's worth,
I always thought

20:48.917 --> 20:50.792
you and Lena made an adorable couple.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.000
Do you want me to call her father?
‐ That's okay, Dad.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.625
‐ No, no, no, I'm not afraid to call him.
‐ I am.

20:54.625 --> 20:55.958
You don't have to do that.
‐ No, you shouldn't be.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.000
‐ I don't think you should do that.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.292
CHESTER: Okay. Okay.
GRIFFIN: I appreciate that.

20:58.833 --> 21:01.750
‐ Hey, everybody. What's happening here?

21:01.750 --> 21:02.792
Too early to fall asleep.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.500
I bought <i>Big Bang Theory</i> Clue.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.792
<i>‐ Big Bang.</i>
CHESTER: Mm‐hmm.

21:06.792 --> 21:07.417
Let me get this straight,

21:07.417 --> 21:09.750
Sheldon... kills‐‐

21:09.750 --> 21:11.292
‐ Penny.
CHESTER: Penny.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.792
In the library?

21:13.792 --> 21:14.583
‐ No.
‐ The lab.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.500
‐ The lab.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.083
With a... Galaxy 6, 6S

21:19.083 --> 21:19.833
‐ Galaxy‐‐

21:19.833 --> 21:22.000
‐ Eh, 6, Salaxy 6‐‐

21:24.042 --> 21:26.000
[snoring]

21:26.000 --> 21:26.958
‐ Bazinga.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.417
‐ Mom. Mom?

21:29.917 --> 21:30.583
Dad?

21:30.583 --> 21:32.167
Dad? Dad? Paul?

21:32.167 --> 21:32.917
[Paul snoring]
GRIFFIN: Stacy?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.750
HAGS: Come on, Griffin,
let's get the hell out of here!

21:34.750 --> 21:35.917
‐ What the‐‐ Wait, what the hell is this?

21:36.292 --> 21:37.625
Hags, did you do something?

21:37.625 --> 21:40.125
‐ No! I just gave them
a couple sleeping pills.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.667
‐ You roofied our parents?

21:41.667 --> 21:44.750
‐ I did not roofie our parents.
The pills were in their medicine cabinet.

21:44.750 --> 21:45.917
‐ This is crazy!
‐ Griffin!

21:45.917 --> 21:48.042
Your parents are spooning.
My dad is snoring.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.292
Mom's asleep. Let's go!
‐ No!

21:49.292 --> 21:50.917
Tha‐‐ I'm not going. I'm not leaving.

21:50.917 --> 21:53.042
You have a wristband, that's it, okay.

21:53.042 --> 21:54.042
You go without me.

21:54.708 --> 21:55.500
‐ Go without you?

21:55.917 --> 21:57.917
‐ Lena's gonna meet
her promposal mate there anyway.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.500
I don't want to witness that.

22:00.375 --> 22:03.083
‐ Griffin, I was lying
when I said I wasn't scared.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.042
I <i>am</i> scared.

22:04.375 --> 22:06.792
But I'm not scared about
what's gonna happen tonight.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.500
I'm scared about
what's gonna happen after tonight.

22:09.417 --> 22:10.625
You're going to Brown.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.542
And I'm gonna be stuck here
working at Chuck E. Cheese.

22:13.542 --> 22:14.958
And that's life, Griff.

22:15.375 --> 22:19.625
Look, you go and you beat that
Dr. Seuss promposal asshole to the punch.

22:19.625 --> 22:21.042
You look Lena in the eyes and tell her

22:21.042 --> 22:23.417
exactly what you've wanted
to tell her your entire life.

22:23.917 --> 22:26.125
Tonight we become legends, Griffin.

22:26.125 --> 22:28.500
We go to that party
and we win that Gauntlet.

22:29.125 --> 22:32.083
This is our last chance
to make a great memory.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.833
‐ Wow! That was really good.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.583
That was good.
‐ Thanks.

22:37.583 --> 22:38.750
‐ Did you practice that?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.708
‐ A couple of times. Yeah.

22:44.708 --> 22:45.875
‐ Ughhh!

22:45.875 --> 22:47.708
‐ I know that groan!

22:47.708 --> 22:49.500
‐ Ah, I still don't have a wristband.

22:50.417 --> 22:52.458
What is that? Hags, why are you winking?

22:52.875 --> 22:54.125
GRIFFIN: Man,
I just don't know about this.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.375
I haven't been over to Andrew's house
since, like, the second grade

22:56.375 --> 22:58.000
when his mom did that thing
with the mousetrap.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.083
‐ Who cares? He said
he has extra wristbands.

23:00.083 --> 23:02.125
You need a wristband. Ring the bell.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.958
[doorbell ringing]

23:04.958 --> 23:05.917
GRIFFIN: Should we call him?

23:05.917 --> 23:07.292
HAGS: He don't believe in phones.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.792
[door creaking]

23:10.792 --> 23:11.667
‐ Hello?

23:12.500 --> 23:14.000
‐ Hello?
‐ Hello, hello.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.042
‐ Hello? Andrew?

23:17.125 --> 23:18.167
Hello?

23:22.333 --> 23:23.833
Hi, Mrs. Hellmuth?

23:23.833 --> 23:25.000
‐ What do you want?

23:25.375 --> 23:28.000
‐ Uh, sorry for barging
in your home like this.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.125
Is Andrew here?

23:30.375 --> 23:31.250
‐ Andrew?

23:32.083 --> 23:33.208
My, uh‐‐

23:33.208 --> 23:34.542
‐ Your‐‐
‐ Your son.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.958
‐ Yeah. Son.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.208
You're looking for him?

23:39.208 --> 23:41.292
‐ Uh, yes, ma'am.
It's kind of an emergency.

23:43.750 --> 23:44.875
‐ You guys cops?

23:45.417 --> 23:46.583
‐ No.
‐ No.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.542
GRIFFIN: We're just‐‐
We're in high school.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.042
‐ Griffin? Hags?

23:51.042 --> 23:52.792
HAGS: Andrew!
ANDREW: Holy shi‐‐

23:52.792 --> 23:54.708
Uh, it's okay, Mom. These are my friends.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.125
‐ Your friends? Yeah, right.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.083
‐ I have friends, Mom!
Why don't you believe me?

23:58.083 --> 23:59.958
‐ Why don't I believe
that you have friends?

23:59.958 --> 24:02.750
Probably because your tendency
towards violence

24:02.750 --> 24:04.833
caused us to be banned
from the fucking church.

24:04.833 --> 24:07.375
‐ You didn't give me
my calming pills! That's why.

24:07.375 --> 24:11.500
‐ I canceled our family trip to Reno
to pay for your freaking calming pills!

24:11.500 --> 24:12.750
Why do you think your father left?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.667
ANDREW: You said my dad left
to pursue his dreams.

24:14.667 --> 24:17.000
‐ His only dream was to leave this house.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.417
Happy Binge!

24:19.208 --> 24:21.167
‐ Fuck you, Mom!

24:21.167 --> 24:24.958
I'll bury you behind a Jiffy Lube.
And my friends are gonna help me!

24:24.958 --> 24:26.667
‐ We will not be doing that.
‐ We're not, we're not gonna do that.

24:26.667 --> 24:27.750
‐ I mean, I don't even know him now.

24:27.750 --> 24:31.083
‐ You think I'm afraid
of a couple of <i>puto</i> cops?

24:31.083 --> 24:34.375
I spent 18 years in a Bangkok prison

24:34.375 --> 24:36.875
hanging upside down from my labia.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.833
Two of those years,
I was pregnant with you.

24:38.833 --> 24:42.083
‐ That's not even true, Mom.
Who are you trying to impress?

24:42.083 --> 24:44.500
‐ Take these two guys up to my room

24:44.500 --> 24:46.958
and show them the Chai Ming Fist Bump.

24:46.958 --> 24:48.000
BOTH:
I don't wanna see that.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.417
‐ What the fuck does that even mean, Mom?

24:49.417 --> 24:53.000
‐ I'll burn that tongue if you ever speak
to me that way again.

24:53.000 --> 24:53.750
‐ Do it!

24:54.125 --> 24:54.667
[flesh sizzling]

24:54.667 --> 24:57.042
[both screaming]

24:59.542 --> 25:00.708
DEIDRE: Dinner's in ten.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.250
I love you!
‐ I love you, too!

25:03.250 --> 25:04.083
‐ Give Mommy a kiss.

25:10.625 --> 25:11.708
‐ [lisping]
I'm so sorry about that, guys.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.958
‐ My mom, she just loves
showing off in front of my friends.

25:13.958 --> 25:14.792
[laughing]

25:14.792 --> 25:16.458
‐ Listen, Andrew,
we're in a bit of a rush.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.833
Uh, we just wanted to know
how much we would have to pay you

25:18.833 --> 25:20.250
for those wristbands
you said you can get us?

25:20.250 --> 25:23.000
‐ Well, currency is an illusion
influenced by a false reality.

25:23.458 --> 25:25.083
I live my life on a bartering system.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.458
‐ Okay, we can work with that.
‐ Oh.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.417
‐ So what do you want?

25:28.375 --> 25:29.708
‐ To be your wingman tonight.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.500
‐ Well, of course you can, man.
‐ Really?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.500
‐ Yeah. That's‐‐
‐ Whoa, wait a minute.

25:33.958 --> 25:35.667
You see, me and Griffin, we're a duo.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.875
We've never been a trio.
‐ What are you doing?

25:38.500 --> 25:39.958
‐ Right. Right, right, right. Okay, okay.

25:39.958 --> 25:42.042
‐ Andrew, do you mind if Griffin
and I just have a sidebar over here.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.042
Not about you, at all.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.542
Is that okay? Thank you.
‐ What's going on?

25:44.542 --> 25:47.125
‐ Whoa, we can't bring him, bro.
He's not helping our cool factor.

25:47.125 --> 25:49.875
‐ And you're doing wonders for
our cool factor bringing bonus overalls?

25:49.875 --> 25:52.708
Look, Lena has a wristband.
Sarah has a wristband! I need a wristband!

25:52.708 --> 25:54.875
And having another person to pedal
that monstrosity outside

25:54.875 --> 25:56.292
wouldn't hurt either.
HAGS: Fine.

25:56.292 --> 25:58.000
Fine. Andrew.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.792
‐ Yes.
‐ We're back. Sorry.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.500
‐ Uh‐huh.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.375
What‐‐
‐ You're in.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.208
‐ Yeah, you can be our wingman tonight.

26:03.208 --> 26:03.750
‐ What?

26:03.750 --> 26:04.625
GRIFFIN: Yeah.
HAGS: Yes.

26:05.083 --> 26:05.500
‐ What?

26:05.500 --> 26:07.000
‐ Oh‐kay.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.292
GRIFFIN: Yeah. It's all right.
ANDREW: Oh my god!

26:08.667 --> 26:09.958
Wow! Uh‐‐

26:11.542 --> 26:14.792
I swear... I will not let you guys down.

26:14.792 --> 26:16.042
‐ How 'bout those wristbands?

26:16.417 --> 26:17.708
‐ Ah, yes.

26:17.708 --> 26:19.333
Actually, I 3D printed them.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.000
I 3D print a lot of stuff.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.667
‐ Oh, awesome, man. These things‐‐

26:23.208 --> 26:24.750
‐ Andrew, these are purple.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.500
The Library Party wristbands are orange.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.417
‐ Yes. Hags, that is
a very good observation.

26:29.417 --> 26:32.917
You see, unfortunately,
the guy I usually barter with,

26:32.917 --> 26:34.625
he was all out of the orange filament so‐‐

26:34.625 --> 26:36.875
‐ Well, that doesn't help us at all.
‐ Right, right, right. Uh‐‐

26:37.583 --> 26:39.250
My twin brother Seb has real ones.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.292
‐ Seb? "The Ice Russian?"

26:42.208 --> 26:44.417
Didn't he go to juvie for stabbing
some guy with a screwdriver?

26:44.417 --> 26:45.833
‐ Wait, he's your twin brother?

26:45.833 --> 26:47.167
‐ Yeah. From a different father.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.000
‐ Excuse me.
‐ What?

26:51.708 --> 26:54.042
‐ Heteropaternal superfecundation.

26:56.208 --> 26:57.417
It's actually pretty common.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.042
You see, it's when a woman allows
two random sexual partners

27:00.042 --> 27:02.875
to ejaculate inside of her
during a special two‐egg ovulation.

27:03.292 --> 27:06.958
Yeah. And then she has fraternal twins
from two different fathers.

27:06.958 --> 27:11.000
So I have a... half‐twin brother.
Or a full twin half‐brother.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.208
Halfernal for short. He's actually‐‐
He's, uh, six days older than me.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.667
I was thinking we'd do the old switcheroo.

27:19.167 --> 27:21.083
All right,
just follow my bullshit.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.875
Okay, guys, listen to me.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.125
No matter what he says, do not sit down.

27:29.167 --> 27:31.750
‐ Hello! How are you?

27:31.750 --> 27:33.542
Uh, I'm Hags. This is Griffin.

27:34.375 --> 27:35.375
You know Andrew.

27:38.875 --> 27:39.958
That's a real beer.

27:41.750 --> 27:42.917
SEB: The fuck is it?

27:45.833 --> 27:46.792
‐ Go, go.

27:49.875 --> 27:50.708
[dart pops]

27:51.750 --> 27:53.000
‐ Ah, little brother.

27:54.000 --> 27:54.750
What are you doing here?

27:54.750 --> 27:56.083
I thought you vowed
never to talk to me again

27:56.083 --> 27:58.542
after I made you eat all that tinsel
off the Christmas tree.

27:58.542 --> 28:00.208
‐ Time heals all wounds, brother.

28:00.208 --> 28:01.833
‐ Ah, there's always time to make another.
[rips]

28:01.833 --> 28:03.333
‐ Whoa. Okay. All right.
[dart pops]

28:03.333 --> 28:05.375
Guys, I think we're really getting off
on the wrong foot here.

28:05.375 --> 28:06.375
‐ Are you cops?

28:06.375 --> 28:09.333
‐ We are literally in the same grade.
Why does everyone think we're cops?

28:09.333 --> 28:10.458
‐ I don't really know.
[dart pops]

28:10.458 --> 28:13.000
Oh! Uh, speaking of
the Library Party tonight,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.792
we have these really cool
purple VIP wristbands,

28:15.792 --> 28:16.958
but we don't know where the entrance is.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.792
‐ Yeah, we can't find
any information online.

28:18.792 --> 28:22.292
‐ Yes. So, we just figured a couple top
cool all‐stars like yourselves would know.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.667
‐ VIP?
HAGS: Yes.

28:27.833 --> 28:28.583
‐ Have a seat.

28:30.958 --> 28:32.208
‐ We're standers.
‐ Sit!

28:32.208 --> 28:33.958
‐ Yeah, we can do that.
‐ Sure.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.333
[snorts]

28:42.167 --> 28:42.958
‐ Ohh!

28:45.833 --> 28:46.625
Jersey Turnpike?

28:47.375 --> 28:48.708
‐ Jersey Turnpike?

28:48.708 --> 28:50.458
‐ Half a line of protein,
half a line of creatine.

28:50.458 --> 28:52.000
‐ That's not even drugs?
‐ Yeah, why would I wanna do that?

28:52.000 --> 28:52.667
I don't wanna do that.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.708
‐ If you're not a narc, then you
wouldn't mind doing a Jersey Turnpike.

28:54.708 --> 28:55.167
[airhorn blares]
‐ Oh!

28:55.167 --> 28:56.708
Dude, do the Jersey Turnpike.

28:57.042 --> 28:58.417
[sniffs deeply]

29:01.292 --> 29:04.208
‐ Whoa... [stammers] that burns a lot.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.042
‐ Yeah, baby!

29:05.875 --> 29:06.958
So let me get this straight.

29:07.958 --> 29:10.917
You come into my personal space
with your purple wristbands

29:10.917 --> 29:13.125
and this talk of VIP.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.958
You think you're what, just gonna,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.833
just waltz out of here?

29:18.833 --> 29:19.833
[airhorn blares]
‐ Oh!

29:22.667 --> 29:24.042
‐ Well, you got another thing coming,

29:27.167 --> 29:28.625
because I would love...

29:31.333 --> 29:33.000
to compensate you for those.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.000
Generously.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.917
‐ Yeah, that‐‐

29:36.917 --> 29:38.042
‐ How's a grand sound?

29:38.042 --> 29:39.083
‐ Pssh.
‐ That works.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.417
‐ That's a pretty good deal.
‐ That's great.

29:40.417 --> 29:41.167
‐ Perfect for us.
‐ Huh?

29:41.167 --> 29:43.542
‐ 'Cause no offense,
'cause you're not really the VIP type.

29:44.917 --> 29:45.875
You stand out.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.292
‐ We totally agree.

29:47.292 --> 29:48.583
Thank you for being so honest.

29:48.583 --> 29:49.750
[airhorn blares]
Oh‐kay!

29:49.750 --> 29:52.083
This guy, man. He really likes that thing.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.667
‐ Okay, so if you guys are good,
I think we're good. We're definitely good.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.500
So I think then that's it.
I think that's it then.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.083
So we'll just swap our VIP wristbands
for your normal ones. And that's good.

29:59.083 --> 30:00.333
These are for you.
‐ Thank you, Seb.

30:00.333 --> 30:01.750
Give my boy the cash, all right.

30:01.750 --> 30:04.667
It was nice doing business with you.
‐ Oh, oh, I just have one more question.

30:04.667 --> 30:05.708
Come on.

30:07.125 --> 30:09.042
‐ It's a secret.
‐ It's... it's‐‐

30:11.917 --> 30:13.042
‐ Ahh!
HAGS: Whoa! Whoa!

30:13.042 --> 30:14.083
‐ You think I'm fucking stupid?

30:14.083 --> 30:15.250
‐ No, sir! No, we do not.
SEB: Huh?

30:15.250 --> 30:16.333
[groans]
SEB: You come in here.

30:16.333 --> 30:17.750
You try to take the Gauntlet win from us?

You got‐‐

30:24.250 --> 30:27.208
Wha‐‐ No! What the fuck? Oh, you shot me!

30:27.208 --> 30:28.167
‐ Now let me friend go!

30:28.167 --> 30:29.333
‐ I'm not touching him. He's over there.

30:29.333 --> 30:30.667
‐ Let him go!

30:30.667 --> 30:31.667
‐ I'm not even near him!

30:31.667 --> 30:33.167
‐ Give me the wristbands

30:33.167 --> 30:34.667
or the next one's in the breadbasket,

30:34.667 --> 30:35.833
I fucking swear to God!

30:35.833 --> 30:36.917
‐ Give it to him. Give it to him.

‐ Oww! What the‐‐

30:52.375 --> 30:53.667
‐ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Hags.

30:53.667 --> 30:55.875
‐ Goddammit! You shot me in my neck!

30:55.875 --> 30:56.708
‐ God, I don't want to look at it.

30:56.708 --> 30:57.792
ANDREW: I didn't mean to! I'm sorry.

30:57.792 --> 30:58.792
‐ We gotta go!

30:58.792 --> 31:00.208
‐ Don't pull it out! Don't pull it out!

31:00.208 --> 31:01.583
GRIFFIN: Go! Go! Go!
HAGS: Go!

31:01.583 --> 31:02.250
‐ Get 'em!

31:02.250 --> 31:04.542
GRIFFIN: We got the wristbands.
Let's go. We got 'em.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.125
ANDREW: I'm sorry!

31:06.125 --> 31:07.458
HAGS: What the fuck?

HAGS: Pump it!
MAN: I'm gonna kick your ass!

It's right on the shaft.

31:14.750 --> 31:15.750
ANDREW: Did we lose them?

31:15.750 --> 31:16.750
GRIFFIN: Do you think we can stop?

31:16.750 --> 31:18.208
HAGS: Ow.
GRIFFIN: I think we're good.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.458
HAGS: Owww!
GRIFFIN: I think we can stop!

31:21.583 --> 31:22.458
Oh!

31:22.833 --> 31:23.667
Oh, that was crazy.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.292
HAGS: Ahh!

31:26.000 --> 31:26.958
Oww!

31:26.958 --> 31:28.583
All right. We're okay.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.875
‐ That was so crazy.

31:29.875 --> 31:32.250
‐ I got a dart in my neck!

31:32.250 --> 31:33.917
I have a dart in my neck.

31:33.917 --> 31:36.292
‐ I'm sorry, Hags. I didn't mean to.

31:36.292 --> 31:37.875
‐ Griffin, what the fuck is on your face?

31:37.875 --> 31:39.917
‐ What?
HAGS: What's on your face?

31:39.917 --> 31:41.250
Oh! Oh my god.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.458
‐ I don't know, it's stuck.

31:42.458 --> 31:43.667
‐ You gotta rip it off.
HAGS: Holy‐‐

31:43.667 --> 31:44.792
‐ Just rip it?
‐ Like a Band‐Aid.

31:44.792 --> 31:48.042

31:55.250 --> 31:56.667
HAGS: Okay, okay.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.375
‐ Andrew, did I just rip my eyebrow off?

31:59.292 --> 32:00.542
‐ No, not all of it.

32:00.542 --> 32:01.792
HAGS: Ohh!

32:01.792 --> 32:04.042
‐ Oh fuck! Uh‐‐

32:04.042 --> 32:07.083
Okay. Okay. How long does it take
for an eyebrow to grow back?

32:07.750 --> 32:08.792
‐ Six to twelve months.

32:08.792 --> 32:10.708
‐ Months!
‐ Couple weeks to get one shipped.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.792
‐ I need serious medical attention here.

32:12.792 --> 32:15.417
‐ I can't talk to Lena like this.
I can't talk to Lena with one eyebrow.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.458
‐ You guys need
some Library Party wristbands?

32:17.458 --> 32:18.333
$50.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.458

I got 'em. Fifty bucks.

That is the most perfect hummus as always.

go upstairs and study,

Well, you already got into Brown.

You should be having some fun.
You're not gonna be a teenager forever.

a hard time sleeping.

I've laid a piece of wood out,

roller rink party,

to do the <i>Mambo No. 5</i> shuffle?

Well, I crashed into Christina Barnes
and dislocated her shoulder,

34:40.375 --> 34:43.167
and then she couldn't go
to the cheer finals in Fort Lauderdale.

34:43.167 --> 34:44.958

and everyone blamed me.
