WEBVTT

00:08.942 --> 00:11.179
The things we do
for money.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.813
My little brother -- I need
to be there when you find him.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.982
You're making the biggest
Goddamn mistake of your life.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.350
straight across.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.585
I know where he lives.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.120
Do not fuck with me.
I'll need your help.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.155
I found it
under Steve's land.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.724
This is our land.
Ours alone.

00:25.093 --> 00:30.264
Tomorrow is the new day
in which the demons wake up,

00:30.364 --> 00:34.202
in which darkness will open
the eyes of the blind,

00:34.302 --> 00:36.704
because we are
all sinners.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.926
900.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.174
Gotcha.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.131
700. Hmm

01:42.102 --> 01:43.171
All right.

01:43.271 --> 01:46.073
Next stop New Orleans.

01:46.174 --> 01:51.011
The problem is,
gotta travel through the
red zone to get there.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.513
What's that?

01:52.613 --> 01:55.082
That's an area rife with
every kind of bandit

01:55.183 --> 01:57.218
and goddamn
reprobate there is.

01:57.318 --> 02:01.622
Assholes that'll shoot you
as soon as take a shit.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.759
So from here on out,

02:05.859 --> 02:08.262
I'm gonna need you to
keep a special watch.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.130
You understand me?

02:10.231 --> 02:13.066
-Sure.
-Sure, you sure?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.335
Yep.

03:06.287 --> 03:11.659
Okey dokey, you
can start to relax.

03:11.759 --> 03:15.729
Not that you've been
particularly vigilant anyway.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.007
You know what potato
means in Italian?

03:27.107 --> 03:31.044
-No.
-It means a woman's hoo-ha.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.515
No it doesn't.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.849
I swear to God.

03:35.949 --> 03:41.088
-Have you tasted one before?
-No.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.097
Well, it ain't for
everyone, I guess.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.243
Damn.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.955
A head weighs less than a body.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.226
Did you ever think about that?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.898
I'm not gonna stop, Anderson.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.738
Ever.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.427
Do you feel that, Pop?

08:15.395 --> 08:18.331
You were right.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.433
There's still gold in this land.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.773
You can be proud of me now, Pop.

08:27.340 --> 08:32.345
This goddamn place is about to
become what we always dreamt of.

08:32.445 --> 08:36.784
The city that bears our name.

08:36.884 --> 08:41.555
They called us mad men...
murderers.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.726
But time has proved us right.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.375
Where'd you learn
to kill like that?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.877
Like what?

09:06.580 --> 09:08.215
With a tomahawk.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.484
Well, I was raised
by the Natives,

09:11.585 --> 09:14.588
but I was schooled
by a bounty hunter.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.558
"Schooled by a bounty hunter."

09:18.659 --> 09:22.529
Yep, raw-potato-eatin' alcoholic
who lived in a cart.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.099
What about you?

09:35.676 --> 09:36.910
Huh?

09:37.010 --> 09:39.446
-How did you end up--
-We are the same, Red.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.617
We're exactly the same.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.788
Still don't explain this.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.692
Oh, this?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.795
This is all me.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.957
It all depends
on how good you are.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.036
You know I used to collect
these when I was a boy.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.638
Of course they were not
as detailed as these,

10:38.739 --> 10:39.807
with the pistons
and the couplings.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.274
Get outta my house.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.176
Go fetch your wife, Steve.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.647
I said, go fetch your wife.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.622
-How much
is that bag worth?
-Huh?

10:55.723 --> 10:57.290
How much the bag,
how much it worth?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.159
-A lot.
-And what we talking?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.428
Enough to
get to California.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.497
And some.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.268
Tell me more
about that girl.

11:08.368 --> 11:12.039
-What girl?
-The smartest girl in Greenvale.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.608
Someone who deserved better.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.012
Best thing about that town.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.848
You know I never
thought I'd say it,

11:20.948 --> 11:24.151
but I think you were the thing
holding that town together.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.386
Well that's mighty
kind of you, Red.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.559
Why did you come back?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.496
'Cause what happened to
you happened to my mother.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.998
A long time ago.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.068
-You remember his face?
-Of course I remember his face.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.654
Look at me.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.823
Everything is gonna be
all right, I promise.

14:16.924 --> 14:21.028
Oh, Dorian, your daddy
really doesn't know

14:21.128 --> 14:22.963
if everything's
gonna be all right.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.833
See kid there are two
possible outcomes here,

14:26.934 --> 14:29.336
one of them is...
is good,

14:29.436 --> 14:32.372
and the other is very bad.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.675
Okay, let's just talk,
you and me all right?

14:35.775 --> 14:37.344
No, I'm tired of talking.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.678
Sign it.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.380
So you're gonna
give me your land

14:40.480 --> 14:41.714
and in an exchange
you'll get nothing.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.650
No money, no share,
just his life.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.453
-Stay where you are, Michelle.
-Please, Charles, let him go.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.022
I know you don't
wanna hurt my child.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.225
All I want is the land.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.963
-Sign it.
-Steve please.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.831
Surely, we can come to
some kind of agreement.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.333
It's too late for that.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.435
-It's not, it's not too late.
-Gently!

15:03.603 --> 15:04.871
Hey, hey.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.507
We already had an agreement.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.709
Oh yeah, hmm?

15:09.809 --> 15:11.278
Why don't you tell him?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.515
Tell him.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.619
-Yes.
-Yes.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.588
See?

15:25.858 --> 15:28.128
And you used to be so beautiful.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.803
Did you ever really love her?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.944
Now you tell him.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.414
-Tell him to sign.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.648
Tell him!

15:51.051 --> 15:54.054
We're never leaving.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.591
Oh, Michelle.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.727
Wait a minute, wait!
Thompson wait!

16:02.695 --> 16:05.232
I'm signing, okay?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.421
Thank you.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.691
Thank you for this
wonderful gift.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.163
You wanna see it?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.366
What?

17:07.094 --> 17:09.996
-Thought there were
more of 'em.
-No.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.565
They're the two you
need to worry about.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.272
-You see
the one on the right?
-Uh-huh.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.309
He can shoot you between
the eyes from a mile off.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.279
Trust me.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.047
Trust you?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.585
What about the other one?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.857
Crazy as fuck.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.092
Just be careful.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.628
Yeah, don't you worry about me,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.331
I've killed all kinds.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.065
You be careful.

17:46.166 --> 17:50.603
We made a deal, Sheriff,
that means you don't die.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.567
You are perfect.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.005
Are you hungry?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.976
You can have anything you like.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.514
Chocolate.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.149
Chocolate.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.851
Of course.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.643
Good to see you, Symone.
How are you?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.611
-Hungry.
-The usual?

19:38.711 --> 19:39.979
-Sure.
-Keep your money.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.448
It's on the house.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.869
So why did you come back, honey?

20:04.271 --> 20:07.640
Without Eve and McCoy,
this town is doomed.

20:09.075 --> 20:14.113
Well, I thought I might take
things over myself, Tony.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.536
Thank you for your attention.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.339
We're looking for someone
to take us to Condor.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.609
We are not bandits.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.446
There's no need to be afraid.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.984
And it's a matter
of great urgency.

20:52.084 --> 20:57.524
So I'm willing to pay $100 to
whoever provides the service.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.127
$100.

21:06.533 --> 21:10.370
Never seen so many starving
folks spit on so much money.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.153
You know the area?

21:27.687 --> 21:28.855
You come.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.957
-No, I'm sorry, sir.
-Yes.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.759
But I cannot leave the saloon.

21:32.859 --> 21:36.162
-These have been a real
hard few days in town.
-Sir.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.302
For a matter of such urgency,

21:43.403 --> 21:46.773
you're offering less than
you paid for your boots.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.975
I didn't ask for
your opinion, kid.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.314
I'll take you there.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.487
For $200.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.430
The last fella you tried
to double your money on

22:10.530 --> 22:11.464
gave you that?

22:11.564 --> 22:12.765
The fella who gave me this

22:12.865 --> 22:14.166
died with his throat cut.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.807
It's 200 'cause you ain't
gonna find anyone else
to take you there.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.275
They're all too scared.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.612
But you're not scared?

22:28.448 --> 22:32.785
You need to go there,

22:32.885 --> 22:34.454
and I need the money.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.127
Tell me something,

22:41.227 --> 22:43.262
is this the first
time you've negotiated

22:43.362 --> 22:44.497
with someone like me?

22:44.597 --> 22:48.267
I bet...

22:48.367 --> 22:51.571
someone else sets the
price for your little body.

23:02.815 --> 23:06.218
All right kid, you got a deal.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.489
Lets go.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.103
John,

23:25.137 --> 23:27.173
give the young lady a horse,

23:27.273 --> 23:29.676
-and stay here in
case he comes back.
-Will do.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.781
Easy buddy.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.150
The sheriff.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.319
-McCoy?
-McCoy.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.988
How well do you know him?

23:42.088 --> 23:43.723
Pretty well.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.091
Good.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.460
So you can tell me all
about him on the way.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.697
Are you planning to kill him?

23:53.700 --> 23:55.367
To kill him?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.969
I knew I was right.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.678
I've always known.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.019
This is what you wanted?

25:12.579 --> 25:13.780
Dorian?

25:15.882 --> 25:17.049
Dorian.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.715
Hey!

25:53.620 --> 25:54.921
Dorian!

26:30.022 --> 26:32.558
You're late.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.661
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.763
I got held up.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.101
Blaine?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.536
Oh, Blaine. Yeah...

26:46.005 --> 26:47.473
Well...

26:49.008 --> 26:51.477
what with the rain,
and the floods.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.550
As you know, Blaine
can't swim, so...

27:01.888 --> 27:03.155
The money?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.661
Well, that can't swim either.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.733
You shouldn't play
it like this McCoy.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.602
Two against one is a
hand you can't win.

27:16.703 --> 27:20.506
It's not exactly two
against one, you see?

27:22.408 --> 27:23.676
I brought my friend.

27:28.815 --> 27:32.184
Nothing to worry about...
a boy with a bag.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.490
A friend?

27:38.590 --> 27:43.930
Yesterday, a prisoner,
today already a friend.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.715
Gentleman.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.385
It doesn't have to be this way.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.599
I'm gonna ask you and
I'm gonna ask you once.

28:20.699 --> 28:24.503
And you'd better think
real hard before answering.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.773
Bronson's order was
to recover the money,

28:26.873 --> 28:29.809
but nothing was said about
not killing his brother.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.084
What exactly are you asking me?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.057
Where is the money?

28:45.157 --> 28:47.659
It's gone.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.365
Ah yes.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.666
The rain.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.568
Tch.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.144
Where's the money?

30:45.244 --> 30:47.746
Well...

30:49.381 --> 30:50.549
Ah!

31:04.563 --> 31:06.132
Bye, sheriff.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.145
Oh.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.880
Oh yeah, oh shit.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.826
You're still alive?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.531
I think so.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.168
Goddamn thing went
right through me.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.171
So you're his brother?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.175
And you said nothing.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.143
I've spent most of my life

31:51.243 --> 31:53.345
trying to forget that
he is my brother.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.084
What was I supposed to say?

31:59.085 --> 32:00.252
That I'm a thief?

32:00.352 --> 32:01.720
I know you're a thief.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.355
My brother's a
goddamn psychopath?

32:06.358 --> 32:08.294
That killed my mother.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.933
I know you might find
this hard to believe,

32:17.003 --> 32:20.206
I hate that son of a
bitch more than you do.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.610
Yeah?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.946
And now you're
gonna prove it.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.615
-Lemme see.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.351
Yeah, you'll be fine.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.221
Let's deal with these
wounds and get outta here.

32:37.223 --> 32:40.159
I was so close to
getting on that ship.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.696
So close to crossing that ocean,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.565
getting out of this shit.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.500
And yet you came after me.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.441
We're always running, McCoy.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.343
I'm not coming.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.414
-We had a deal.
-Ah, the deal.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.453
I told you where he was.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.688
I told you how to find him.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.259
That's the deal.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.695
I ain't got a dollar to my name.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.731
-Now give me that bag.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.200
Can't do that.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.540
Things we do for money, eh Red?

33:37.916 --> 33:39.885
-The things
we do for money.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.222
What did you say?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.891
I was there.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.065
I saw you under that bed.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.702
You were so scared.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.306
Just a little boy.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.376
I saved you then,

34:04.476 --> 34:06.512
just like I did when you
were hanging upside down

34:06.612 --> 34:08.247
with your ass hanging out.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.850
So the least you could do

34:11.950 --> 34:14.753
is give me that
goddamn black bag.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.064
Red,

34:26.898 --> 34:29.101
promise me one thing.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.672
If you are the
last man standing,

34:37.309 --> 34:41.113
make sure my brother ends
up in that dirty black bag.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.221
Billy.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.924
Mom.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.375
Dorian!

36:18.410 --> 36:19.711
Dorian!

36:21.580 --> 36:22.881
Dorian!

37:02.921 --> 37:04.055
Come on.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.110
These things have
nothing to do with us.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.581
You did
the right thing.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.461
He threatened to kill our child.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.639
We bury him here.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.776
And then we bury this place.

40:47.312 --> 40:48.480
Forever.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.718
Agreed?

44:01.807 --> 44:03.641
What are you reading?
