WEBVTT

00:02.358 --> 00:04.925
I was messing around
with this T.A.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.333
who is married.

00:06.368 --> 00:07.969
We're gonna
get you a scholarship

00:08.003 --> 00:09.637
to any school you want
to go to in this country.

00:09.671 --> 00:11.638
And you two can stay here
and screw like bunnies

00:11.673 --> 00:13.440
and use protection.

00:13.474 --> 00:16.075
Anyone comes to you opening
their mouth about anything,

00:16.110 --> 00:18.110
I don't care what it is,
you come to me first.

00:18.145 --> 00:21.113
You got two days
to come up with my money.

00:21.147 --> 00:22.647
I'm gonna take care of it.

00:22.682 --> 00:24.249
You know that he was
in prison, right?

00:24.283 --> 00:26.984
Aggravated assault...
He was a drug dealer.

00:27.018 --> 00:30.620
Aggravated assault
and drug dealing, huh?

00:30.655 --> 00:33.356
Ready! Set!
Hut, hut!

00:33.391 --> 00:36.592
Y'all punch this in,
you go home!

00:36.627 --> 00:38.594
Yeah!

00:38.628 --> 00:41.263
Good work, fellas!
Good work.

00:41.298 --> 00:42.298
Hey, uh, coach.

00:42.332 --> 00:44.467
Hey, uh, excuse me.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.868
You know Baylor's staffing up

00:45.903 --> 00:47.370
for their football camp
this summer,

00:47.405 --> 00:48.939
- Um, and I've got...
- Baylor?

00:48.973 --> 00:50.807
Yeah, Baylor.
I've gotten really good

00:50.841 --> 00:53.310
at, like, washing towels
and fixing things around here.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.145
Um, can you give me
a recommendation letter?

00:55.179 --> 00:57.713
Recommendation...
Um, well, all right.

00:57.748 --> 00:59.348
Well, write something up
and put it on my desk.

00:59.383 --> 01:01.150
Well, but, coach,

01:01.184 --> 01:03.618
- I can't recommend myself.
- Sure, you can.

01:03.653 --> 01:05.019
You're asking me.
I'm telling you.

01:05.054 --> 01:06.554
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:06.588 --> 01:07.955
That's legal?
O-okay.

01:07.990 --> 01:09.457
Hey, coach, great practice!

01:09.491 --> 01:11.525
Hey, is there an outlet?

01:11.559 --> 01:13.026
You got an outlet around here?

01:13.061 --> 01:14.628
Buddy, what the hell
are you doing?

01:14.662 --> 01:16.130
We got to hook up
a bunch of stuff.

01:16.164 --> 01:18.832
- You got an outlet out here?
- An outlet?

01:18.867 --> 01:21.135
Well, we're gonna keep watch.
It's rivalry week.

01:21.170 --> 01:22.904
We're not gonna have
any Dillon Panthers

01:22.939 --> 01:24.372
coming out here
messing up your field,

01:24.407 --> 01:25.640
I guarantee you that right now.

01:25.674 --> 01:27.342
You come out here and join us.

01:27.376 --> 01:28.844
Come on, we're gonna
have a cold one.

01:28.878 --> 01:31.113
- Got your name on it.
- We'll be out here all night.

01:31.147 --> 01:33.015
Colonel, what you planning
to do with that shotgun?

01:33.049 --> 01:34.583
Nobody's gonna mess
with this field, coach.

01:34.617 --> 01:36.151
The safety's on.

01:36.186 --> 01:37.419
I still got the bullets
in my pocket.

01:37.454 --> 01:38.754
Take the gun away from him.

01:38.788 --> 01:40.422
All right, all right,
don't worry.

01:40.457 --> 01:41.657
I'm not kidding.
Take that thing away from him.

01:41.691 --> 01:42.791
All right, it'll be safe.

01:42.826 --> 01:44.059
We're gonna get

01:44.094 --> 01:45.661
that oil rig trophy
again, baby.

01:45.695 --> 01:47.496
All right, guys, let's get
that charcoal ready.

01:47.530 --> 01:50.165
I'm hungry.

01:50.199 --> 01:53.134
Coach.

01:53.169 --> 01:55.670
How you doing?
Sorry I'm late.

01:55.704 --> 01:57.405
Hey.

01:57.439 --> 01:59.006
- Lookin' good.
- Hey.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.808
- You're lookin' good.
- Thank you, thank you.

02:00.842 --> 02:02.276
Good to see you.

02:02.310 --> 02:04.077
It's good to see you too.

02:04.111 --> 02:06.079
- There he is.
- That's Noah.

02:06.113 --> 02:08.014
Look at him.
He's a big football fan already.

02:08.048 --> 02:09.848
I got a little Panthers football
I have him throwing around.

02:09.883 --> 02:12.619
Loose spiral,
but he's working on it.

02:12.653 --> 02:14.320
I'll be damned.

02:14.355 --> 02:15.989
I'm teaching him
everything you taught me, yeah.

02:16.023 --> 02:17.524
Here, it's got
a little spit-up on it.

02:17.559 --> 02:19.426
Gracie got that on there,
but you can clean it up.

02:19.461 --> 02:20.961
Coach, I really
appreciate the gesture.

02:20.996 --> 02:22.263
I just... I do got to tell you

02:22.297 --> 02:24.532
that streets look better
in blue.

02:24.566 --> 02:26.134
You can go to hell.
Don't be a smart-ass.

02:26.168 --> 02:27.935
He'll wear red.
Red's the color these days.

02:27.970 --> 02:29.704
No, thank you very much, coach.

02:29.738 --> 02:31.606
You know,
it took some convincing

02:31.640 --> 02:33.774
to get the wife to have him
in the first place,

02:33.809 --> 02:35.876
but now that we do, she can't
wait to have another one.

02:35.911 --> 02:39.446
I didn't know
that you made it legal.

02:39.481 --> 02:40.981
Sure did.

02:41.016 --> 02:42.616
- You got married.
- I did.

02:42.650 --> 02:44.317
You got married,
and you don't tell me about it.

02:44.352 --> 02:45.685
Coach, I didn't want
to tell you over the phone.

02:45.719 --> 02:47.387
I could've saved you
the trouble,

02:47.421 --> 02:48.821
if you asked me whether you
should get married or not.

02:48.856 --> 02:50.656
How am I supposed
to send something

02:50.691 --> 02:52.525
if I don't know you're married?

02:52.559 --> 02:54.060
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I've been super busy.

02:54.094 --> 02:55.662
- I'm very happy for you.
- I've been busy

02:55.696 --> 02:59.065
because I got... I also
got a promotion this year.

02:59.099 --> 03:01.901
I'm a big-time,
full-fledged agent now.

03:01.935 --> 03:03.469
You can take that,
that's yours.

03:03.504 --> 03:04.770
This the firm Frank Sharp's at?

03:04.804 --> 03:06.238
- It is.
- Aero.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.473
Yeah.

03:07.508 --> 03:08.675
Not too bad, though, huh?

03:08.709 --> 03:11.010
One of your former proteges.

03:11.045 --> 03:13.012
Hey, you did good.

03:13.047 --> 03:15.181
You know, uh,
people are talking about you.

03:15.216 --> 03:16.850
There's a lot of heat.

03:16.884 --> 03:19.085
- We haven't even looked yet.
- Five minutes, please.

03:19.119 --> 03:21.754
I'm sorry.

03:21.788 --> 03:23.889
I get a phone call today
about you.

03:23.924 --> 03:25.157
They know I know you.

03:25.191 --> 03:26.659
Colleges are interested in you.

03:26.693 --> 03:29.762
So I just got to...
I just got to ask.

03:29.796 --> 03:31.931
College consideration
for you again or...?

03:31.965 --> 03:35.935
I couldn't be happier
where I am right now.

03:35.970 --> 03:37.904
Got an undefeated team.

03:37.939 --> 03:40.140
Family's doing good.

03:40.175 --> 03:41.675
The wife is happy.

03:41.710 --> 03:43.410
We almost got the daughter
out of the house.

03:43.445 --> 03:45.246
Got the other daughter
coming up.

03:45.281 --> 03:47.115
I've got a hell of a team.
I love the school I'm at.

03:47.149 --> 03:49.751
Things are good.
I have no interest right now.

03:49.786 --> 03:51.286
All right.

03:51.321 --> 03:53.422
- But I appreciate it.
- All right.

03:53.457 --> 03:55.357
Yeah, but how am I supposed
to write a letter

03:55.391 --> 03:56.958
recommending myself?

03:56.992 --> 03:58.793
I mean, you talk
about yourself enough.

03:58.827 --> 04:00.128
- You should know.
- Shut up.

04:00.162 --> 04:01.863
Well, I'm your girlfriend.

04:01.897 --> 04:03.631
You should be able to brag
about me more than anybody else.

04:03.665 --> 04:04.865
You want me to write
your letter?

04:04.900 --> 04:06.233
I want you to write it.

04:06.268 --> 04:07.568
I think you'd be good
to write it.

04:07.602 --> 04:08.803
Hey, hey, hey.

04:08.837 --> 04:10.237
Oh, Sookie, Sookie.

04:10.272 --> 04:11.639
Oh, there they are,
there they are.

04:11.673 --> 04:14.208
The king and queen
of East Dillon High.

04:14.242 --> 04:15.710
What up?
How you doing, Jess?

04:15.744 --> 04:17.144
- I'm good.
- Son, I got something for you.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.779
Yeah, he just moved back in.

04:18.814 --> 04:21.350
- He... he moved in?
- I got something for you.

04:21.384 --> 04:23.252
Why is he all excited?

04:23.286 --> 04:24.820
'Cause I'm bearing gifts, son.
I'm bearing gifts.

04:24.855 --> 04:28.257
I didn't come empty-handed.
Look here.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.393
- Oh.
- Wow.

04:30.427 --> 04:32.662
Yeah, brand-spanking-new,
not a mark on 'em.

04:32.696 --> 04:34.096
Yo, pop, where'd
you get these from?

04:34.131 --> 04:36.766
Well, you know, from a friend

04:36.801 --> 04:38.235
who wants you to look sharp.

04:38.269 --> 04:40.104
Look, I got something
for you too, Jess.

04:40.138 --> 04:41.839
Wait, wait, wait.
Where'd you get all this stuff?

04:41.873 --> 04:43.840
It says "T.M.U." on it.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.076
Yeah, T.M.U.

04:46.111 --> 04:50.847
Wait, is it from someone
who's from T.M.U.?

04:50.882 --> 04:53.650
From... not from T.M.U.,
a friend of T.M.U.

04:53.685 --> 04:55.485
- Man.
- Oh.

04:55.519 --> 04:57.621
'Cause I think my boy about
to get a scholarship, huh?

04:57.656 --> 05:01.258
Pop, these are fly right here,

05:01.293 --> 05:03.861
but, um...

05:03.895 --> 05:07.264
I can't take 'em.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.133
You know, coach would be upset

05:09.167 --> 05:10.534
with the whole
recruiting thing.

05:10.569 --> 05:12.303
He's not gonna
like that too much,

05:12.337 --> 05:14.272
so I can't.

05:14.306 --> 05:16.040
All right, man.

05:16.074 --> 05:18.042
Jess, you staying
for dinner, hon?

05:18.077 --> 05:20.444
- Yea... Uh, yeah, I'd love to.
- All right.

05:20.479 --> 05:22.113
You don't want
no free stuff, man.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.681
It's up to you.

05:23.715 --> 05:25.650
Yeah, I mean, these are dope.

05:25.684 --> 05:28.052
'Cause we gonna have us
a celebration.

05:28.087 --> 05:29.988
Mm-hmm.
Celebration.

05:30.022 --> 05:34.392
Hey, he's moving in, permanent?

05:34.426 --> 05:35.894
Yeah.

05:35.928 --> 05:38.196
Look at my mom.
She's never been happier.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.065
I'm happy.

05:40.099 --> 05:43.535
And he took care
of our problem.

05:43.569 --> 05:45.037
Yeah, I mean...

05:45.071 --> 05:48.641
It doesn't matter how, Jess.
He did.

05:48.675 --> 05:51.077
He's been showing improvement
ever since he got out.

05:51.111 --> 05:52.478
All right?

05:52.512 --> 05:54.080
All right, come on.

05:54.114 --> 05:56.349
- Y'all ready to eat? Let's go.
- Pork chops.

05:56.383 --> 05:57.917
Hey, colonel, did you
ever load that gun?

05:57.951 --> 05:59.753
Not yet, buddy.
I'm getting ready to.

05:59.787 --> 06:01.321
I hope we don't have
to load it.

06:01.355 --> 06:03.156
Hey, don't be getting that
all over...

06:03.191 --> 06:05.092
It's rivalry week.

06:05.127 --> 06:07.028
We were expecting fireworks,

06:07.062 --> 06:08.896
but this is really gonna throw
some fuel on the fire.

06:08.931 --> 06:10.431
Wait.

06:10.465 --> 06:12.699
The name of the website
is lionhater.com.

06:12.734 --> 06:15.936
I don't know where
all this stuff came from,

06:15.970 --> 06:18.371
but all I can say
is turns out 6-0

06:18.405 --> 06:20.406
isn't East Dillon's
only record.

06:20.441 --> 06:22.175
Tell you all about it
after a quick break.

06:22.209 --> 06:24.510
- What the heck is that?
- I don't know what that is.

06:24.545 --> 06:26.045
Anybody got a laptop?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.513
Deacon, you can't get
no Internet out here.

06:27.548 --> 06:28.514
Where you going, buddy?

06:30.651 --> 06:32.085
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

06:32.119 --> 06:33.553
Sammy Meade.
Turn on Sammy Meade.

06:33.588 --> 06:34.888
Here, listen to this.
Can you hear this?

06:34.923 --> 06:36.557
And according to this website,

06:36.591 --> 06:39.460
some of these Lion players
have quite a background...

06:39.494 --> 06:42.296
Aggravated assault,
sale of a controlled substance.

06:42.331 --> 06:44.198
Looks like quarterback
Vince Howard

06:44.233 --> 06:46.467
doesn't just evade
defenses either.

06:46.502 --> 06:48.469
He's got two resisting arrests,

06:48.504 --> 06:50.739
and that's on top
of a theft charge.

06:50.773 --> 06:52.207
Those of you wondering
how coach Taylor

06:52.241 --> 06:53.875
turned his program
around so fast

06:53.909 --> 06:55.276
have got your answer.

06:55.310 --> 06:56.611
He's got a football team

06:56.645 --> 06:59.546
full of violent criminals.

Busted!

07:53.900 --> 07:56.469
This is unbelievable.

07:56.503 --> 07:57.670
What are you worried
about, choir boy?

07:57.704 --> 07:59.005
You're not even in it.

07:59.039 --> 08:00.840
My thing is how'd they
get our records?

08:00.874 --> 08:03.343
Supposed to be under lock
and key, under wraps, you know?

08:03.377 --> 08:05.512
Yeah, well, somebody
leaked it, I guess.

08:05.546 --> 08:07.181
I'll tell you who leaked it.

08:07.215 --> 08:09.750
It was those damn Panthers.

08:09.784 --> 08:11.919
Dang, Tink,

08:11.954 --> 08:13.688
why were you breaking into
a pawn shop?

08:13.722 --> 08:16.690
Dude, it wasn't even my idea.
It was my cousin's.

08:16.725 --> 08:19.360
This ain't right.

08:19.395 --> 08:21.262
It's messed up.

08:21.296 --> 08:23.097
"And her dress was stuck
in her backside,

08:23.132 --> 08:24.499
"so I plucked it out for her.

08:24.533 --> 08:26.635
She turned around,
punched me in my eye."

08:26.669 --> 08:29.338
He said, "well, how'd you get
the other black eye, then?"

08:29.372 --> 08:30.939
The kid says,
"well, when she turned around,

08:30.974 --> 08:32.307
I stuffed it back in there
for her."

08:36.145 --> 08:38.013
Hey, good morning, coach.

08:38.047 --> 08:39.881
Just wanted to ask
a simple question.

08:39.916 --> 08:42.851
Who is it that, uh,
released the records

08:42.885 --> 08:45.621
of the players online?

08:45.655 --> 08:47.623
We're all as shocked
as you are, coach.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.058
Y'all realize,
those are just kids.

08:50.093 --> 08:51.527
I agree, coach, and I'm
here to personally assure you...

08:51.561 --> 08:53.328
Who released
the records, Randy?

08:53.363 --> 08:56.665
I'd like to help you, coach,
but we don't know.

08:56.699 --> 08:58.166
It needs to be shut down.

08:58.201 --> 09:00.569
I know y'all can do that.
Shut it down.

09:00.603 --> 09:02.538
Y'all want to go after someone,
go after me.

09:02.572 --> 09:03.872
Don't go after my players.

09:03.907 --> 09:06.542
- Coach, we didn't do it.
- Mac.

09:06.576 --> 09:09.845
Well, um, you know,
it's a personal situation.

09:09.879 --> 09:13.648
I-I think she's just having
a hard time adjusting and...

09:13.683 --> 09:15.317
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:15.351 --> 09:17.352
You know, well, I think
we can handle it from here,

09:17.387 --> 09:19.254
but I just...
We're just real committed

09:19.288 --> 09:22.357
to her not letting
this semester go, so...

09:22.392 --> 09:24.025
Oh, that would be great.

09:24.059 --> 09:26.194
I'll do that,
and... and I thank you so much.

09:26.228 --> 09:27.762
All right, I'll see you then.

09:27.796 --> 09:29.197
All right, thank you.
Bye-bye.

09:29.231 --> 09:30.831
Did dad make a tofu scramble?

09:30.866 --> 09:32.533
No, there's cereal.

09:32.568 --> 09:35.203
Cereal, great.

09:35.237 --> 09:38.673
Excuse me.
What are you doing today?

09:38.707 --> 09:40.375
Um...

09:40.409 --> 09:44.512
Just answering a few emails
and just doing some stuff.

09:44.547 --> 09:47.715
Well, I'd like for you to take
Gracie to school this morning.

09:47.750 --> 09:51.119
Why can't you take her?
You always take her.

09:51.154 --> 09:53.055
If you're gonna be here
at this house, you can help out.

09:53.089 --> 09:55.024
I'd like for you to pick her
up this afternoon as well.

09:55.058 --> 09:57.027
And while you're at it,
you need to start thinking

09:57.061 --> 09:59.929
about how you're paying
your father back for that car.

09:59.964 --> 10:02.031
Put your shoes on.
You got ten minutes.

10:02.066 --> 10:03.466
Awesome.

10:03.501 --> 10:04.800
And could you clear
that table, please?

10:04.835 --> 10:07.337
Yep, I'm on it.

10:13.577 --> 10:15.311
- I'm telling you...
- No energy today.

10:15.346 --> 10:19.382
Their minds are anywhere
but here right now.

10:19.416 --> 10:21.084
Everybody come in here.

10:21.118 --> 10:22.719
Everybody up, let's go.

10:22.753 --> 10:24.287
Everyone settle in over here.

10:24.321 --> 10:29.225
I want to have a word with you.

10:29.259 --> 10:33.595
Information released
on that website was personal.

10:33.629 --> 10:35.430
The fact that
that information was released

10:35.465 --> 10:37.065
was criminal.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.835
Whoever was involved
in releasing that information

10:39.869 --> 10:41.069
will be found, I promise you.

10:41.104 --> 10:42.571
Doesn't matter who did it.

10:42.606 --> 10:46.075
It's out there,
and everybody knows, period.

10:46.109 --> 10:47.610
You ought to be pissed.

10:47.645 --> 10:50.246
I'm pissed. You ought
to be damn well pissed.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.448
But there's a reason someone
let that information out,

10:52.482 --> 10:54.016
and that's to get
in your heads.

10:54.050 --> 10:56.118
It's to blind you with anger,

10:56.153 --> 10:57.820
and I'm asking you...

10:57.854 --> 11:01.657
I'm asking you to please
not let that happen.

11:01.692 --> 11:04.794
Here's what I'd like to do.

11:04.828 --> 11:08.531
Today, what do you say
we focus?

11:10.501 --> 11:13.335
Friday...

11:13.370 --> 11:15.504
What do you say we punish?

11:15.539 --> 11:16.940
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

11:16.974 --> 11:18.975
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.444
- Everybody in agreement?
- Yes, sir.

11:21.479 --> 11:23.379
Let's do it.
Let's go.

11:23.413 --> 11:24.781
Break it into groups
and begin right now.

11:24.815 --> 11:27.249
Let's go.
Break it out, coaches.

11:27.284 --> 11:29.352
Let's go to work, boys.
Let's go.

11:29.386 --> 11:32.021
Vince.

11:36.827 --> 11:38.995
How you doing?

11:39.029 --> 11:40.997
You think if the colleges
see that stuff,

11:41.031 --> 11:42.765
they still gonna call?

11:42.800 --> 11:44.434
They still gonna want me?

11:44.468 --> 11:46.035
Let me tell you something.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.772
None of this information's
gonna matter.

11:48.806 --> 11:50.874
None of that crap
is gonna matter one bit.

11:50.908 --> 11:52.375
It doesn't matter
how many games we win,

11:52.409 --> 11:53.877
how many touchdowns I throw.

11:53.911 --> 11:58.014
All they see
is a bunch of thugs, coach.

11:58.049 --> 12:02.085
Everybody thinks it,
but they never say it.

12:04.254 --> 12:06.288
Real men don't use
real weights.

12:06.323 --> 12:08.524
Real men fender bench.

12:08.558 --> 12:11.460
- Two, three, four.
- Hey, Billy.

12:11.494 --> 12:13.495
Yeah, one second.

12:13.529 --> 12:15.130
Mindy wants to know what
you did with Stevie's blocks.

12:15.165 --> 12:17.666
Underneath his crib
where they always are.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.967
Hi, daddy.

12:19.001 --> 12:20.368
Hey, Becky.

12:20.403 --> 12:22.071
Hey, Luke.

12:22.105 --> 12:23.639
You're lookin' good.

12:23.673 --> 12:26.508
Thanks.

12:26.543 --> 12:29.811
Really? Really?

12:29.846 --> 12:32.547
"Hey, Becky,
you look real pretty."

12:32.582 --> 12:33.815
No, seriously,
that's your game?

12:33.850 --> 12:35.083
That's, like,
your go-to line?

12:35.118 --> 12:36.718
No games, I just like her.

12:36.752 --> 12:38.353
Your wife told me to go for it.
I'm going for it.

12:38.387 --> 12:41.590
My wife is a woman,
dumbass, okay?

12:41.624 --> 12:45.026
Listen, man, she doesn't
understand how men work.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.428
Lesson number one,
if you're into a chick,

12:47.462 --> 12:49.263
you can't pay
any attention to her.

12:49.297 --> 12:52.099
- What?
- Trust me on this, okay?

12:52.134 --> 12:54.268
Look, how do you think
I got Mrs. Riggins?

12:54.303 --> 12:57.271
I went into the landing strip
for two weeks straight,

12:57.306 --> 12:59.874
all right,
and I got a lap dance

12:59.908 --> 13:04.679
from every single girl
in the place except for her.

13:04.713 --> 13:06.680
Mrs. Riggins works
at the landing strip?

13:06.715 --> 13:10.251
- Okay, look, point is...
- Like, Wednesdays or Frid...

13:10.285 --> 13:12.286
No, it doesn't matter what
days she works there, all right?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.054
- Right.
- Okay?

13:14.088 --> 13:16.857
The point is
she was begging me,

13:16.891 --> 13:19.960
begging me to go into
the champagne room with her.

13:19.995 --> 13:21.261
- All right?
- Wow.

13:21.296 --> 13:22.863
Yeah.

13:22.897 --> 13:24.932
- So ignore her.
- Just ignore her.

13:24.966 --> 13:28.703
Hey, look,
you got to let them know

13:28.737 --> 13:30.137
they can't get this.

13:30.172 --> 13:32.205
All right,
this doesn't come for free.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.408
They got to earn this,
all right?

13:35.443 --> 13:37.243
- All right.
- Yeah.

13:37.278 --> 13:39.446
She still...
she still work there?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.081
Yeah, she still works there.

13:41.115 --> 13:42.382
Like, part-time?
Like, weekends, like...

13:42.416 --> 13:44.117
You know what you're gonna do?

13:44.151 --> 13:45.819
- You're gonna fender bench.
- All right.

13:45.853 --> 13:47.287
All right, fender bench.

13:47.321 --> 13:50.790
Busted!

13:50.824 --> 13:53.559
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

13:53.593 --> 13:56.261
- Baby's asleep.
- Good.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.563
What are you doing?

13:58.597 --> 14:00.298
I'm looking
at this damn website.

14:00.332 --> 14:01.933
It's supposed to be down.
It's still up.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.734
Oh, honey, stop looking at it.

14:03.769 --> 14:05.136
Well, it's supposed
to be shut down.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.104
Shh, shh, shh.
I know.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.739
Some of this stuff's
pretty harsh.

14:08.773 --> 14:11.241
- I'm sure it is.
- I mean, tinker, holy cow.

14:11.275 --> 14:13.511
But you know what?
It doesn't matter, honey.

14:13.545 --> 14:15.279
They're your boys.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.648
And you're doing
a great job with them.

14:17.683 --> 14:19.317
You're changing their lives.
Don't forget that.

14:19.351 --> 14:20.685
I know.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.489
And all this is gonna be
behind them.

14:27.528 --> 14:30.030
Let's have a barbecue.

14:30.064 --> 14:31.431
A barbecue?

14:31.466 --> 14:33.666
Yeah,
a morale-building barbecue.

14:33.701 --> 14:35.368
You said it.
I didn't bring it up.

14:35.403 --> 14:37.370
- You brought it up first.
- Barbecues build morale.

14:37.404 --> 14:39.171
- That's why you have 'em.
- You want to have a barbecue?

14:39.206 --> 14:42.607
No, seems like that's what
we should do, though.

14:42.641 --> 14:44.175
Get Julie to help out.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.943
You know, give her
something to do around here.

14:45.978 --> 14:48.045
- That would be nice.
- Well, I agree with you.

14:48.079 --> 14:49.713
- Let's do it just for that.
- Hello?

14:49.748 --> 14:51.048
Coach Taylor.

14:51.082 --> 14:52.549
This is coach Taylor.
Who's this?

14:52.584 --> 14:54.051
John Aroldi, Shane State,
down in Florida.

14:54.086 --> 14:55.386
Yeah?

14:55.421 --> 14:57.122
Jason Street
gave me your number.

14:57.156 --> 14:59.457
I'm calling about an opening
we have on our staff.

14:59.492 --> 15:02.127
Well, there must have been
some sort of miscommunication.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.697
We did have that conversation,
but the conversation ended

15:04.731 --> 15:07.067
with me saying
that I-I was not interested

15:07.101 --> 15:08.969
in any assistant coaching jobs.

15:09.003 --> 15:10.504
Well, I'm not offering you one.

15:10.538 --> 15:12.173
I'm looking for a head coach,

15:12.207 --> 15:14.442
and your name is
at the top of our list.

15:17.011 --> 15:19.380
Well, uh...

15:19.414 --> 15:21.248
I'm... I'm pretty happy
where I am right now,

15:21.283 --> 15:23.084
- to be quite honest.
- Well, I don't doubt that.

15:23.118 --> 15:24.852
A hell of a season
you're having this year,

15:24.887 --> 15:27.188
- which is why I'm calling.
- Listen, John,

15:27.222 --> 15:28.823
you sort of caught me
at a bad time right now,

15:28.858 --> 15:30.559
- but I-I do appreciate...
- Coach, I want you

15:30.593 --> 15:32.260
to understand,
I'm very serious about this,

15:32.295 --> 15:34.029
'cause I think you're
about the best damn

15:34.064 --> 15:36.365
high school football coach
there is in the nation.

15:36.399 --> 15:39.168
- Thank you for having...
- I'm gonna call you again.

15:39.202 --> 15:40.903
I don't think we're done yet.

15:40.937 --> 15:43.573
- All right, John, thanks.
- You bet.

16:13.737 --> 16:16.273
What's going on?

16:18.576 --> 16:21.945
Look, I know you got something
on your mind, son.

16:21.979 --> 16:25.382
I feel like I'm playing
with a fixed deck, pop.

16:25.416 --> 16:27.550
I be out here early mornings,

16:27.584 --> 16:29.652
working hard
for them scholarships, pop.

16:31.822 --> 16:34.123
Just seems like overnight
T.M.U. probably just

16:34.157 --> 16:36.392
deleted my number
off their phone.

16:36.427 --> 16:40.228
Hmm.

16:40.263 --> 16:42.597
Hmm.

16:42.632 --> 16:44.633
205.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.667
Hmm.

16:45.701 --> 16:48.503
Oh, 352.

16:48.538 --> 16:50.805
405.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.075
What's all that?

16:54.109 --> 16:56.778
Area codes

16:56.812 --> 17:01.183
for, uh, Alabama, Florida,

17:01.217 --> 17:03.653
Oklahoma.

17:03.687 --> 17:06.756
I've been talking
to these schools all day, man.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.325
Wait, they still want me,

17:08.358 --> 17:10.461
even after all that crap
they saw on the Internet?

17:10.494 --> 17:12.696
They don't care...

17:12.731 --> 17:15.866
Not since I told them, uh,
T.M.U.'s gonna be offering you.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.335
Pop, we don't know if they
gonna give me an offer.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.770
- Hey, hey.
- What?

17:19.805 --> 17:21.204
They don't know that.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.040
But I tell you what,

17:24.075 --> 17:26.210
they all gonna be at the game
on Friday night.

17:26.243 --> 17:28.012
Wait, you got them to come
see me play Friday?

17:28.046 --> 17:31.148
They're coming
to see you, uh-huh,

17:31.183 --> 17:34.485
see that cannon of yours.

17:34.519 --> 17:35.786
So look here.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.488
Show off a 60-yard arm,

17:37.522 --> 17:39.456
win yourself a scholarship.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.359
Think you can do that?

17:41.393 --> 17:45.730
I don't make the calls.
That's coach's job.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.668
Remember when you was
a little kid,

17:49.702 --> 17:53.038
and we went over
to Carroll Park?

17:53.073 --> 17:56.509
You wanted to climb
that big old tree, hmm?

17:56.543 --> 17:59.579
And I told you
it was too big, didn't I?

17:59.614 --> 18:01.248
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

18:01.282 --> 18:02.750
You didn't care.

18:02.784 --> 18:04.418
- I still went up there.
- Yep, you went.

18:04.453 --> 18:06.587
You was lovin'
every minute of it

18:06.622 --> 18:08.189
till it was time to come down.

18:08.224 --> 18:09.591
You didn't want to come down.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.392
I didn't think about that.

18:11.427 --> 18:13.595
No, no, you was holding on
to them branches forever, boy,

18:13.629 --> 18:16.330
scared...

18:16.365 --> 18:18.366
- Crying.
- Wasn't funny, man.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.234
Uh-huh.

18:20.269 --> 18:21.602
Now, you remember what I said

18:21.637 --> 18:23.671
when I was standing
under the tree,

18:23.706 --> 18:25.906
"Man, come on, let go.
Fall into my arms."

18:29.277 --> 18:31.245
"Don't worry, son.

18:31.279 --> 18:34.315
I ain't gonna
let you fall."

18:36.786 --> 18:38.687
Don't worry.

18:38.721 --> 18:42.424
Son, I ain't gonna
let you fall.

18:44.828 --> 18:47.130
I ain't gonna let you fall.

18:57.909 --> 18:59.476
Y'all, we're gonna have
300 people at this house.

18:59.511 --> 19:01.211
And it's a mess.
I need everybody to pitch in.

19:01.245 --> 19:04.981
Jules, I'm gonna need you
to go shopping today

19:05.015 --> 19:06.916
for the whole barbecue, okay?

19:06.950 --> 19:08.351
- Okay, well, make a list.
- Did you hear me?

19:08.385 --> 19:10.352
Do you have a list?

19:10.387 --> 19:11.587
Yeah, we're gonna go make
a list in two seconds.

19:11.621 --> 19:13.522
What the hell is this?

19:13.556 --> 19:14.857
The day of the barbecue,
you are responsible

19:14.891 --> 19:16.459
for setting up
and for your sister,

19:16.493 --> 19:17.860
- you understand me?
- Right, but you're gonna

19:17.894 --> 19:18.927
watch her at the barbecue
though, right?

19:18.962 --> 19:20.128
Who eats this stuff?

19:20.163 --> 19:21.630
What did I just say?

19:21.664 --> 19:22.864
You are taking care
of Gracie Bell

19:22.898 --> 19:24.499
and setting up
for the barbecue.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.100
That's your responsibility.
You get me?

19:26.134 --> 19:28.035
Since when has my closet
become a storage unit?

19:28.069 --> 19:29.603
Julie, if you're gonna
drink juice,

19:29.637 --> 19:31.438
don't leave an inch of it left
in the bottle

19:31.472 --> 19:33.774
when you stick it back
in the refrigerator.

19:33.808 --> 19:36.076
That's it, all right.
All right.

19:36.110 --> 19:38.011
Sledgehammer.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.581
Sledgehammer, five more.

19:40.616 --> 19:42.149
Give me five more, come on!

19:42.183 --> 19:46.053
One, two, three,

19:46.088 --> 19:48.223
four, five.

19:48.257 --> 19:50.892
Let's go, quick feet.
Let's go, let's go.

19:50.927 --> 19:52.728
You keep talking
about scholarships.

19:52.762 --> 19:54.763
You don't look like you want
to get one right now.

19:57.267 --> 19:58.934
There you go.
Look at that.

19:58.968 --> 20:00.669
Go up over your head.

20:00.703 --> 20:03.605
And down.

20:03.639 --> 20:05.907
Stevie gets angry
when you don't run hard.

20:05.942 --> 20:08.410
That's right.

20:08.444 --> 20:10.545
Come on, give me five more.
Let's go.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.113
Keep it up.
Keep your legs moving.

20:12.147 --> 20:13.448
Keep your legs moving.

20:13.482 --> 20:18.219
Three, two, one.

20:18.254 --> 20:21.422
All right, come drink up.

20:23.292 --> 20:24.693
You thirsty?

20:24.727 --> 20:26.228
What the hell is that?

20:26.262 --> 20:28.029
Goodness in a glass.

20:28.064 --> 20:31.800
Suck it down.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.769
- It's good for you.
- Coach, that's nasty.

20:33.803 --> 20:35.203
Just drink it, all right?

20:35.238 --> 20:37.973
I know what I'm doing here.

20:38.008 --> 20:39.308
All right.

20:39.342 --> 20:41.577
What are all
those chunks in there?

20:41.611 --> 20:43.379
What is that?

20:43.413 --> 20:45.281
Oh, some of it didn't blend,
I don't think.

20:45.315 --> 20:46.882
That's all right.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.818
I used to make those
for my brother occasionally.

20:48.852 --> 20:50.653
That's what got him
a state championship,

20:50.687 --> 20:52.488
if I do say so myself.

20:52.522 --> 20:54.423
And it also got him
into college.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.825
Difference between you and Tim

20:55.859 --> 20:58.095
is that Tim actually liked
to hit people.

20:58.129 --> 20:59.829
I don't get the vibe
that you do.

20:59.864 --> 21:02.065
- I do, coach.
- Well, I never seen it.

21:02.099 --> 21:03.399
You tell me you like
to hit people.

21:03.434 --> 21:05.235
- Hell, yeah.
- Well, let me tell you

21:05.269 --> 21:07.236
about a guy
named Tommy Larkins,

21:07.271 --> 21:09.972
6'3", 215-pound receiver

21:10.007 --> 21:13.642
for the Dillon Panthers.

21:13.677 --> 21:14.977
This is him right here.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.779
You tell me you like to hit.

21:16.814 --> 21:18.581
Then I want you to go out
on the first play of that game,

21:18.615 --> 21:20.116
and you knock that kid
on his ass.

21:20.150 --> 21:21.851
You get a bead on him,

21:21.885 --> 21:23.319
and you take him out.

21:23.353 --> 21:24.787
You think you can do that?

21:24.821 --> 21:26.255
Hell, yeah, I can do that!

21:26.289 --> 21:28.591
Why don't you prove it to me?

21:28.625 --> 21:30.960
All right.

21:30.994 --> 21:33.028
There we go.
There we go.

21:33.062 --> 21:34.964
Harder! Harder! Harder!

21:34.998 --> 21:37.132
There we go, there we go,
there we go!

21:37.167 --> 21:38.167
Wait, wait.

21:38.201 --> 21:41.202
Hey, my baby's crying.

21:41.236 --> 21:42.837
Hey, Stevie.

21:42.871 --> 21:44.638
Oh, look at that.
Look at that. Look at that.

21:44.672 --> 21:46.139
Watch this. Watch this.
See that. See that.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.374
Look at that.
I mean, he on his toes, baby.

21:47.408 --> 21:49.475
He on his toes.
Look at that, bam!

21:49.510 --> 21:51.311
Yeah, man, you know
he can carry... He got the feet,

21:51.345 --> 21:53.212
but he got... but he got
a 60-yard cannon, right?

21:53.247 --> 21:56.315
And I'm afraid that if we
don't get a chance to see it,

21:56.350 --> 21:57.883
he gonna be
a running back, man.

21:57.918 --> 21:59.652
Hey, let's grab some water!

21:59.686 --> 22:01.287
Hydrate!

22:01.321 --> 22:03.823
- Grab some water, gentlemen.
- Hydrate!

22:03.857 --> 22:05.224
Hey, uh, coach.

22:05.259 --> 22:07.693
I keep rewriting
that recommendation letter,

22:07.727 --> 22:10.128
and I'm... I'm trying
to get it to you, but...

22:10.163 --> 22:12.131
Recommendation letter?

22:12.165 --> 22:13.898
Oh, yeah, the recommenda...

22:13.933 --> 22:16.234
Yeah, I called
coach Briles over there.

22:16.269 --> 22:18.469
Wait, you called
the head coach for me?

22:18.503 --> 22:20.905
- Are you serious?
- Let me ask you something.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.073
How's Vince doing?

22:23.108 --> 22:26.643
He's better than ever.
Why you ask?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.212
You don't notice
anything about anyone

22:28.246 --> 22:31.248
getting in touch with T.M.U.
on his behalf by chance?

22:31.282 --> 22:33.517
No, I-I don't.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.752
All right.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.022
Let's be honest man,

22:39.057 --> 22:41.158
you think he can make it
in the pros?

22:41.192 --> 22:42.159
- You know what I mean?
- He has potential.

22:42.193 --> 22:43.694
He said you got potential.

22:43.728 --> 22:45.062
Potential? That's what
I'm talking about.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.530
Let's go!
I said get some water,

22:46.564 --> 22:48.032
not drink all of it.
Let's go!

22:48.066 --> 22:49.500
What school
do they get the kids

22:49.534 --> 22:51.101
- to the pros quick, man?
- A big school.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.436
It'd have to be somewhere

22:52.470 --> 22:54.404
where you're
comfortable, though,

22:54.439 --> 22:56.907
- somewhere that's a good fit.
- Someplace close to home.

22:56.941 --> 22:58.708
- I want mama to see me play.
- 'Cause I hear the east coast

22:58.743 --> 23:00.577
is where you get most
of the TV time.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.346
Honestly, I wouldn't worry
about the TV time for now.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.449
Hey, Vince, you gonna join us?

23:05.483 --> 23:07.084
- Yes, sir, coach.
- Yeah, he coming, man.

23:07.118 --> 23:09.253
You know, we... we just talking
a little strategy, man.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.555
That's all right, if I can
have my quarterback, please.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.057
Your... your quarterback?
Okay, man, that's it.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.759
Yeah, your quarterback.
All right.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.461
Can you let him air it out
a little bit, though?

23:17.496 --> 23:19.263
I mean, just once.
You know what I mean?

23:19.298 --> 23:21.633
Let him throw that 60-yard bomb,
man, just once.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.369
Pop, pop, pop.
No, it's okay, man. It's cool.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.770
60 yards right on the button.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.472
Come on,
you the king-maker, right?

23:26.507 --> 23:27.607
So make him the king.
That's all I'm saying.

23:27.641 --> 23:28.975
All right, all right.

23:29.010 --> 23:30.878
You the earth-shaker.

23:30.912 --> 23:32.713
I mean, you the mastermind,
you know what I'm saying?

23:32.747 --> 23:34.448
I mean, I'm just talking
about bam.

23:34.482 --> 23:36.283
And he gonna hit it on the
button, you know what I mean?

23:36.317 --> 23:38.118
Everybody gonna cheer.

23:38.152 --> 23:39.552
They gonna do a pep rally
for you, just for you.

23:39.587 --> 23:40.987
You know you got
a problem there, right?

23:41.022 --> 23:42.589
I sure do.

23:42.623 --> 23:44.758
Got them great plays
coming out your head, man.

23:44.792 --> 23:46.059
So just pull
one of them out there

23:46.093 --> 23:47.360
that say 60 yards on it.

23:55.369 --> 23:56.703
Hey, get away from that grill.

23:56.737 --> 23:59.940
You're gonna
burn yourself. Argh!

24:07.417 --> 24:09.285
Hey, just let me make sure
that it's not poisoned,

24:09.319 --> 24:10.452
all right?

24:10.487 --> 24:11.988
It's not.
You can eat it.

24:19.095 --> 24:21.964
Lions, let's have a prayer.

24:21.998 --> 24:24.933
Father, we're always mindful
of the words

24:24.967 --> 24:26.634
of James Russell Lowell,

24:26.669 --> 24:28.770
that truth is forever
on the scaffold,

24:28.804 --> 24:31.772
and wrong is forever
on the throne.

24:31.807 --> 24:34.942
Yet that scaffold
sways the future.

24:34.977 --> 24:38.213
And behind the dim unknown
standeth God within the shadow,

24:38.247 --> 24:40.448
keeping watch above his own.

24:40.483 --> 24:42.284
Additionally, heavenly father,

24:42.318 --> 24:45.087
give strength
to this community of brothers

24:45.121 --> 24:47.924
and commit their focus
to Friday.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.661
In your name, we pray.

24:50.695 --> 24:52.396
Lions say amen.

24:52.430 --> 24:53.631
Amen.

24:53.665 --> 24:55.833
Let's eat.

24:55.867 --> 24:57.667
I recommend the brisket.
Lookin' pretty good.

24:57.702 --> 25:00.571
Hey, Luke.

25:00.605 --> 25:01.972
Hey, Julie.
What's going on?

25:02.006 --> 25:04.709
Hey, yeah, load it in there.

25:04.743 --> 25:05.843
Yeah, looks like you got
your hands full.

25:05.878 --> 25:06.911
Can I help you with this stuff?

25:06.945 --> 25:08.313
Um, sure.

25:08.347 --> 25:10.281
College, uh...
college is out right now?

25:10.316 --> 25:13.785
Um, yeah, we're kind of
in the middle of our finals...

25:13.819 --> 25:14.986
Oh, nice.

25:15.020 --> 25:16.654
Sort of
midterm-y things, yeah.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.023
Is it cool?

25:18.057 --> 25:20.325
I... Yeah, college is...
College is great.

25:20.359 --> 25:22.794
He's a basketball player.
He ain't football at all.

25:22.829 --> 25:24.629
He is not.
He's not.

25:24.664 --> 25:26.799
Y'all let these boys
have the ball,

25:26.833 --> 25:28.367
these little kids
have the ball for a while.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.668
Let 'em have the ball!

25:29.702 --> 25:30.869
That's so tacky.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.439
They a bunch of grown men.

25:33.473 --> 25:35.040
Nothing but
little boys, though.

25:35.074 --> 25:37.609
Oh, I know, and Vince
is catching his dad up

25:37.644 --> 25:41.013
on all the sports shows
and TV shows,

25:41.047 --> 25:42.514
and just seeing them interact,

25:42.549 --> 25:44.283
it's too much.

25:44.317 --> 25:47.920
That's nice to hear...

25:47.954 --> 25:50.522
You know, especially 'cause
it didn't start off

25:50.557 --> 25:51.957
on the greatest foot.

25:51.991 --> 25:53.825
Yeah, that's true.
It didn't.

25:53.859 --> 25:55.593
But, you know,
they got some time apart,

25:55.628 --> 25:57.862
and, I mean, look at 'em now...

25:57.897 --> 26:00.866
- My boys.
- He's down in the end zone.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.301
You see that?

26:02.335 --> 26:04.837
That's everything
a girl could want.

26:04.871 --> 26:07.673
I'm happy for you.

26:07.708 --> 26:09.675
Yeah, this is he.

26:09.710 --> 26:10.977
I'm happy for you.

26:11.011 --> 26:13.713
Oh, yeah, man, hey.
Glad you called.

26:13.747 --> 26:15.381
What's there to talk about?

26:15.416 --> 26:17.017
- So when can we come by?
- Give him the ball, baby.

26:17.051 --> 26:20.019
Yeah, yeah, man.
We interested in your school.

26:20.054 --> 26:22.055
We had talked about it.

26:22.089 --> 26:25.692
We wanted to see what
you're working with, though.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.697
I like the sound of that.

26:30.731 --> 26:32.632
Hey, hey, listen, man,
I got to go.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.634
Yeah, I-I'll call you later.
All right.

26:34.668 --> 26:36.736
Thanks for your help.
Okay.

26:36.771 --> 26:38.572

They interested in my boy.

that everything

27:01.129 --> 27:02.597
was gonna come through me,

27:02.631 --> 27:04.365
and that there was
gonna be a process to it.

No, that's not how

of informing me

27:13.341 --> 27:14.909
how you do remember it,

- I'm not arguing with you.
- I'll bring the books back.

28:58.910 --> 29:01.045
She'll have a week to study,
and then we got a week

29:01.079 --> 29:03.680
to get her back up there
and take her damn exams.

29:03.715 --> 29:05.048

around with the students?

Well, it takes two to tango

36:17.713 --> 36:20.749
What the hell's he doing?
What are you doing?

36:20.783 --> 36:22.851
Wait a second.
Howard's shifting the offense.

36:22.885 --> 36:24.687
Looks like they're gonna run
a play here, folks.

36:24.721 --> 36:27.123
Howard takes the snap.
He's looking deep.

36:27.157 --> 36:29.592
Oh, my,
did he launch that thing.

36:29.626 --> 36:32.628
And Panther coach Mac McGill
can't believe this...

36:32.663 --> 36:35.164
65 yards in the air.

36:35.199 --> 36:36.700
Ruckle's got it.

36:36.734 --> 36:38.769
Oh, it's gonna be
another touchdown.

36:38.803 --> 36:41.105
Put some sprinklies
on my ice cream, folks.

36:41.139 --> 36:43.040
That is dessert.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.343
Another Lions touchdown.

36:45.377 --> 36:49.381
Oh, my, good old-fashioned
Texas butt-whoopin'.

36:51.651 --> 36:53.652
If y'all were wondering
if coach Taylor

36:53.687 --> 36:56.489
walked into this game
with a chip on his shoulder,

36:56.523 --> 36:59.124
I'd say it was more like
a block of cement.

36:59.159 --> 37:01.627
Ouch, there is
no love lost here.

37:01.661 --> 37:03.462
We in this!

37:03.496 --> 37:05.730
That's not who we are, Eric.

37:08.066 --> 37:10.667
There it is.

37:10.702 --> 37:12.669
What do you got to say, huh?

37:12.703 --> 37:14.704
Get off my field!

37:14.739 --> 37:16.974
Get off!
Get off the field!

37:17.008 --> 37:17.974
Go home!

37:18.009 --> 37:19.409
Go home!

37:19.443 --> 37:20.711
You're a bunch of losers!

37:20.745 --> 37:22.179
Get off! Get off!

37:28.654 --> 37:30.855
So you're saying
you chose tonight

37:30.890 --> 37:33.091
to throw the longest pass
of your life

37:33.126 --> 37:35.594
during the most meaningless
play of the entire season?

37:35.628 --> 37:37.429
What the Panthers did to you,
what they did to us...

37:37.463 --> 37:39.164
Yeah, they deserved it.
Yeah, I did it.

37:39.199 --> 37:41.233
And you're saying your father
didn't have anything

37:41.268 --> 37:42.235
to do with that?

37:42.269 --> 37:44.204
Yeah, he did.
So what?

37:44.238 --> 37:46.539
All right, yeah...
But we won, didn't we?

37:46.574 --> 37:48.541
He's looking out for my future.
That's right, I did it.

37:48.576 --> 37:51.178
We're 7-0 right now.
We won, all right?

37:51.212 --> 37:53.880
Supposed to be happy.
He's looking out for me.

37:53.914 --> 37:55.915
East Side! East Side!

37:55.949 --> 37:57.583
East Side! East Side!

38:04.223 --> 38:05.857
He's gonna get us a keg
from his dad's bar.

38:05.891 --> 38:07.625
- Hook it up, party tonight.
- How you doing, Luke?

38:07.660 --> 38:08.859
I'm well.
How are you doing, sir?

38:08.894 --> 38:10.394
Look here, I have a young man

38:10.429 --> 38:12.296
that would love to have
your autograph on this.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.132
And, man, you hit number 85,

38:14.167 --> 38:16.301
you made him look
like a war casualty, man.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.103
- Yes, sir.
- Congratulations.

38:18.138 --> 38:20.006
Y'all have a good night.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.041
- Tried to get it out.
- Hey, 4s.

38:22.076 --> 38:24.744
So you stayed
for the whole game?

38:24.779 --> 38:27.047
Yeah, rally girls
had to do concession.

38:27.082 --> 38:28.515
Nice. Cool.

38:28.550 --> 38:29.884
Congrats on the win,
football player.

38:29.918 --> 38:31.252
Oh, thanks.

38:31.286 --> 38:33.287
Glad you liked it.

38:33.322 --> 38:34.789
What are you doing?

38:34.823 --> 38:36.857
Going to Buddy's bar.
Gonna snag a keg.

38:36.892 --> 38:38.626
No, I mean, like,
what are you doing?

38:38.660 --> 38:40.260
You're acting really weird
towards me.

38:40.295 --> 38:43.263
Am I?

38:43.297 --> 38:45.799
"Hey, rally girl,
stadium's that way."

38:45.833 --> 38:48.034
I mean...

38:48.068 --> 38:50.536
I mean, what is that?

38:50.571 --> 38:52.771
I figured it was just, like,
testosterone pumping

38:52.806 --> 38:55.207
- for the game, but...
- Maybe, I don't know.

38:55.242 --> 38:58.945
Well, you're
just usually friendly,

38:58.979 --> 39:01.147
and you call me
by my name, and...

39:01.182 --> 39:03.884
Well, no, I mean, do you
like it when I'm nice to you?

39:03.918 --> 39:08.123
Yeah, I like it
when you're nice to me.

39:08.157 --> 39:11.493
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

39:11.527 --> 39:13.862
Just... someone told me
that if I...

39:13.897 --> 39:15.697
Someone told me
if I wanted you to like me,

39:15.731 --> 39:18.867
I had to, like, ignore you
and blow you off,

39:18.901 --> 39:21.102
and then you'll like me.

39:21.137 --> 39:23.938
Look, Becky, I hate acting
this way towards you, all right?

39:23.972 --> 39:25.973
I really like you.

39:27.976 --> 39:29.610
Well...

39:29.644 --> 39:31.378
I really like you too.

39:31.412 --> 39:34.080
You do?

39:34.114 --> 39:36.650
Yeah.

39:36.684 --> 39:39.086
I really, really do.

39:48.598 --> 39:50.766
Why are you laughing?

39:50.801 --> 39:52.668
It totally worked.

39:52.703 --> 39:55.105
Shut up.

40:07.853 --> 40:10.922
The laundry's done,
and I cleaned the kitchen.

40:10.957 --> 40:12.925
How was the game?

40:12.959 --> 40:15.027
Thank you
for cleaning the kitchen.

40:18.198 --> 40:21.466
I didn't go the game.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.881
Where did you get these?

40:37.915 --> 40:40.283
I just drove to Burleson.

40:44.821 --> 40:47.889
Did you talk to Derek?

40:47.924 --> 40:50.158
Mm-hmm.

40:52.428 --> 40:55.397
What did he say?

41:00.003 --> 41:01.937
You need to study.

41:13.618 --> 41:16.019
Coach Taylor
should be ashamed of himself.

41:16.053 --> 41:18.088
You saw the game.
Am I crazy here?

41:18.122 --> 41:20.090
I can't disagree with you.

41:20.124 --> 41:22.325
All those penalties,
all that trash-talking,

41:22.359 --> 41:24.593
capped off
with a completely unnecessary

41:24.628 --> 41:27.829
in-your-face
65-yard touchdown bomb

41:27.864 --> 41:29.164
to close the game.

41:29.198 --> 41:31.366
What was coach Taylor thinking?

41:31.400 --> 41:33.033
What was the point of all this?

41:33.068 --> 41:36.804
You gonna go to Buddy's
for a beer?

41:36.838 --> 41:39.674
Don't feel like
celebrating tonight.

41:41.576 --> 41:43.411
All right.

41:45.881 --> 41:47.982
Thanks for coming out
and watching the game.

41:48.017 --> 41:50.052
- It was definitely worth it.
- Thank you, thank you.

41:50.086 --> 41:51.954
He was writing it down
when you threw that pass.

41:51.988 --> 41:53.856
I told you,
you got to air it out.

41:53.890 --> 41:55.558
- Yes, sir.
- You'd really like this offer.

41:55.592 --> 41:57.294
You'd really fit in
to what we're doing.

41:57.328 --> 41:59.029
We can make some big changes
with you there.

41:59.063 --> 42:01.398
- Uh-huh, you saw that arm.
- Oh, yeah.

42:01.433 --> 42:03.367
On campus, you take a left,
you're on the beach.

42:03.402 --> 42:04.903
You take a right,
you're in the mountains.

42:04.937 --> 42:07.506
- Oh, we got everything.
- Beach and mountains?

42:07.540 --> 42:09.174
I appreciate it.
I love the beach.

42:09.209 --> 42:11.310
We're about an hour
away from the mountains...

42:11.345 --> 42:12.879
Great place.

42:12.913 --> 42:14.380
All right.

42:14.414 --> 42:15.581
You make sure
that when you get a chance,

42:15.616 --> 42:17.416
you guys come and visit us.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.051
You'd really like it there...
Great place to go to school.

42:19.085 --> 42:21.887
Yes, sir. Thank you again
for... for coming out.

42:21.922 --> 42:23.422
Don't forget to give me a call.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.424
- I will not, will not.
- I'll be calling you.

42:33.967 --> 42:36.268
I got you.
