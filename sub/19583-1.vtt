00:54.440 --> 00:56.954
Gentlemen, cock your pistols.

01:02.360 --> 01:07.115
<i>Barry's father had been bred,</i>
<i>like many sons of genteel families...</i>

01:07.800 --> 01:09.677
<i>... to the profession of the law.</i>

01:09.960 --> 01:13.748
<i>There is no doubt he would've made</i>
<i>an eminent figure in his profession...</i>

01:14.360 --> 01:16.510
<i>... had he not been killed in a duel...</i>

01:17.280 --> 01:19.794
<i>... which arose over the purchase</i>
<i>of some horses.</i>

01:34.240 --> 01:37.232
<i>Barry's mother,</i>
<i>after her husband's death...</i>

01:37.800 --> 01:40.314
<i>... lived in such a way</i>
<i>as to defy slander.</i>

01:41.960 --> 01:45.430
<i>Many a man who had been charmed</i>
<i>by the spinster...</i>

01:45.800 --> 01:47.677
<i>... renewed his offers to the widow.</i>

01:49.160 --> 01:51.674
<i>But she refused all proposals</i>
<i>of marriage...</i>

01:52.400 --> 01:55.198
<i>... declaring that she lived</i>
<i>only for her son...</i>

01:55.840 --> 01:58.070
<i>... and the memory of her departed saint.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:52.750
<i>First love! What a change</i>
<i>it makes in a lad.</i>

02:54.080 --> 02:57.231
<i>What a magnificent secret it is</i>
<i>he carries with him!</i>

02:59.480 --> 03:03.075
<i>The tender passion gushes out</i>
<i>of a man's heart.</i>

03:04.240 --> 03:06.754
<i>He loves as a bird sings...</i>

03:07.280 --> 03:09.874
<i>... or a rose blows from nature.</i>

03:12.360 --> 03:13.395
Killarney.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.195
Now, what shall it be?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.077
Turn around and face the wall.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.359
<i>The object of Barry's attention, and...</i>

03:36.600 --> 03:38.591
<i>... the cause of his early troubles...</i>

03:38.680 --> 03:41.990
<i>... was his cousin,</i>
<i>Nora Brady by name.</i>

03:53.640 --> 03:57.599
I have hidden my neck ribbon
somewhere on my person.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.356
If you find it, you can have it.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.630
You are free to look anywhere for it.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.073
I will think little of you
if you do not find it.

04:34.680 --> 04:35.954
I cannot find it.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.232
You haven't looked properly.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.954
I cannot find it.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.673
I'll give you a hint.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.238
I feel the ribbon.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.679
Why are you trembling?

05:35.080 --> 05:37.310
At the pleasure of finding the ribbon.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.110
Liar.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.598
<i>About this time the United Kingdom</i>
<i>was greatly excited...</i>

06:53.040 --> 06:54.712
<i>... by the threat...</i>

06:54.880 --> 06:56.791
<i>... of a French invasion.</i>

06:58.000 --> 07:00.309
<i>The noblemen and people of condition...</i>

07:00.400 --> 07:02.436
<i>... loyally raised regiments...</i>

07:02.640 --> 07:05.108
<i>... to resist the invaders.</i>

07:07.040 --> 07:10.999
<i>Their scarlet coats and swaggering airs</i>
<i>filled Barry with envy.</i>

07:26.720 --> 07:28.756
<i>Brady Town sent a company to join...</i>

07:28.840 --> 07:32.753
<i>... the Kilwangen Regiment</i>
<i>of which John Quin was the Captain.</i>

07:35.800 --> 07:38.314
<i>The whole country was alive</i>
<i>with war's alarums...</i>

07:39.320 --> 07:42.357
<i>... the kingdoms ringing</i>
<i>with military music.</i>

09:19.400 --> 09:21.755
Redmond, what is the matter?

09:26.480 --> 09:29.916
Were you obliged to dance
five times with Captain Quin?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.355
I don't care a fig for Captain Quin.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.758
He dances prettily,
and is a pleasant rattle of a man.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.036
He looks well in his regimentals.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.708
He asked me to dance.
How could I refuse him?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.359
But you refused me.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.517
I can dance with you any day.

09:47.480 --> 09:51.314
To dance with my cousin looks as though
I could find no other partner.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.791
Besides, Captain Quin is a man.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.519
You're only a boy and penniless.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.955
If I meet him again,
you will find out who is the best man.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.675
I'll fight him Captain as he is.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.433
Oh, don't be so silly!

10:08.560 --> 10:09.788
I mean it.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.437
But Captain Quin is known
as a valiant soldier.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.799
It is mighty well of you
to fight yokels...

10:17.040 --> 10:19.679
...but to fight an Englishman
is a different matter.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.031
You best have him take you home.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.875
Redmond!

10:51.000 --> 10:53.514
<i>Barry resolved never to see Nora again.</i>

10:54.680 --> 10:58.389
<i>But such resolutions,</i>
<i>steadfastly held for a whole week...</i>

10:59.200 --> 11:01.714
<i>... are abandoned</i>
<i>in a few moments of despair.</i>

11:05.360 --> 11:09.751
No, Nora, no, except for you
and four others...

11:10.080 --> 11:13.550
...I vow before all the gods my heart...

11:14.400 --> 11:16.391
...has never felt the soft flame.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.115
Ah, you men, you men, John...

11:22.080 --> 11:24.275
...your passion's not equal to ours.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.989
We are like some plant I've read of.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.833
We bear but one flower and then we die.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.674
You, you, you mean you...

11:35.880 --> 11:38.394
...never felt an inclination for another?

11:38.480 --> 11:42.075
Never, my John.
How can you ask such a question?

11:42.560 --> 11:43.959
Oh, darling Norelia!

11:46.240 --> 11:49.755
<i>Nora was chaperoned by her brothers</i>
<i>Mick and Ulick...</i>

11:50.880 --> 11:53.110
<i>... whose interests would be affected...</i>

11:53.280 --> 11:56.431
<i>... by the favourable outcome</i>
<i>of her affair with Quin.</i>

12:08.760 --> 12:10.796
Redmond, how nice to see you.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.275
Redmond!

12:17.800 --> 12:19.518
How could you do this to me?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.071
Redmond, what's the matter?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.519
What are you saying?

12:26.040 --> 12:29.715
I think this might be the moment
to return something to you.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.279
Thank you, Redmond.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.871
I must have forgotten it.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.115
Yes, you did.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.275
Captain Quin, may I introduce
my cousin, Redmond Barry.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.511
Miss Brady, it would appear...

12:50.640 --> 12:53.108
...you both have something
private to discuss.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.675
It would be best for me to withdraw.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.112
Captain Quin, I have nothing private
to discuss with my cousin.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.997
Miss Brady, it appears you have
a great deal to discuss.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.509
Captain Quin, he don't signify any more
than my parrot or lapdog.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.429
Indeed!

13:09.520 --> 13:11.476
Are you in the habit of giving...

13:11.800 --> 13:15.270
...intimate articles of your clothing
to your parrot or lapdog?

13:15.960 --> 13:18.633
Mayn't I give a bit of ribbon
to my own cousin?

13:19.400 --> 13:20.833
You're welcome, miss.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.198
As many yards as you like.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.794
When ladies make presents to gentlemen,
it's time for other gentlemen to retire.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.871
I wish you both a good day.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.069
Jack Quin!

13:32.760 --> 13:34.079
What's the matter?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.758
I'll tell you, sir.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.952
I've had enough of Miss Brady
and your Irish ways.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.715
What is it?

13:40.840 --> 13:44.389
We'll accustom you to Irish ways,
or we'll adopt English ones.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.597
It is not the English way
for ladies to have two lovers.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.993
And so, I'll thank you to pay me
the sum you owe me.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.118
And I resign all claims
to this young lady.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.909
If she fancies schoolboys,
let her take 'em, sir.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.228
You're joking!

13:58.920 --> 14:00.638
I never was more earnest.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.868
John, wait.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.112
Meddling brat!

14:11.840 --> 14:13.751
Your hand is in everybody's pie!

14:14.000 --> 14:18.516
What business have you to quarrel
with a gentleman of substance?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.310
Redmond, me boy, take a seat.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.233
Mrs. Brady and ladies, if you please.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.637
This sort of toast is drunk
too seldom in my family...

16:32.960 --> 16:36.111
...and you'll please to receive it
with all honours.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.909
Here's to Captain and Mrs. John Quin
and a long life to them.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.673
Kiss her, Jack,
for faith you've got a treasure.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.828
Come on, Jack.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.919
There's the man!

17:04.480 --> 17:06.675
A long and happy life together.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.116
A long and happy life together.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.988
Thank you.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.474
Redmond!

17:27.160 --> 17:30.311
Here's my toast to you,
Captain John Quin.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.790
Redmond, how dare you behave like that
in my house!

17:37.480 --> 17:39.516
Mrs. Brady, take the children out.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.200
My dear fellow, are you all right?

17:51.160 --> 17:54.357
In heaven's name,
what does all the row mean?

17:55.360 --> 17:56.554
The fact is, sir...

17:56.720 --> 17:58.597
...the young monkey's in love with Nora.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.672
He found her and the Captain
in the garden today.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.796
Now he's for murdering Jack Quin.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.070
Mr. Brady, I've been insulted grossly
in this house.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.320
I'm not satisfied
with these ways of going on.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.273
I'm an Englishman!
And a man of property!

18:15.440 --> 18:17.635
And this impudent young swine...

18:18.080 --> 18:19.308
...should be horsewhipped!

18:19.400 --> 18:22.039
Mr. Quin can have satisfaction
any time he pleases...

18:22.160 --> 18:25.118
...by calling on Redmond Barry,
Esquire of Barryville.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.199
I'll see the boy home.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.112
A pretty day's work, Master Redmond.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.396
Knowing your uncle is distressed
for money...

18:48.480 --> 18:52.632
...trying to break off a match which
will bring £1,500 a year into the family...

18:53.400 --> 18:57.837
Quin has promised to pay off the £4,000
which is bothering your uncle.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.916
He takes a girl without a penny...

19:01.040 --> 19:05.352
...a girl that's flinging herself
at the head of every man in these parts.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.433
And missing them all!

19:08.600 --> 19:12.513
And you, who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father...

19:12.920 --> 19:13.909
I am.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.393
And this is the return
you make for his kindness?

19:17.680 --> 19:20.194
Didn't he harbour you
when your father died?

19:21.200 --> 19:25.318
Hasn't he given you and your mother
a fine house, rent free?

19:25.480 --> 19:27.755
Mark this, and come what will of it...

19:28.720 --> 19:31.871
...I will fight the man who pretends
the hand of Nora Brady.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.950
I'll follow him if it's into the church
and fight him there.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.555
I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.958
Faith, and I believe ye!

19:46.880 --> 19:49.394
I never saw a lad more game in me life.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.273
Give me a kiss, me boy.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.158
You're after me own soul.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.157
As long as I live, you shall never want
a friend or a second.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.591
Will you take my message to him?
And arrange a meeting?

20:10.320 --> 20:13.471
Well, if it must be, it must.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.235
Look here, Redmond, me boy,
this is a silly business.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.834
The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.593
And as sure as she does,
you'll forget her.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.228
You're but a boy and Quin is willing
to consider you as such.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.029
Right, Quin?

21:37.680 --> 21:38.590
Yes.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.151
Now, Dublin's a fine place.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.028
If you've a mind to ride there
and see the town for a month...

21:49.400 --> 21:51.914
...here's ten guineas at your service.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.950
Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?

21:57.080 --> 22:00.277
Yes, if Mr. Barry will apologize
and go to Dublin...

22:00.840 --> 22:03.991
...I will consider the whole affair
honourably settled.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.958
Say you're sorry, Redmond.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.631
You can easily say that.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.274
I'm not sorry.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.592
And I'll not apologize.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.194
And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell.

22:42.240 --> 22:45.232
Then there's nothing else for it.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.754
God bless you.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.753
This isn't my pistol.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.591
It's all right, it's one of mine.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.158
Yours will serve, if it's needed,
for the next round.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.599
Good luck, Redmond.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.868
Gentlemen...

23:21.960 --> 23:23.393
...cock your pistols.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.834
Gentlemen...

23:40.080 --> 23:41.479
...aim your pistols.

23:55.000 --> 23:55.910
One.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.435
Two.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.035
Three.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.155
Is he dead?

24:18.440 --> 24:19.509
Quite dead.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.193
This has been a sad day's work
for our family.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.195
Ye've robbed us of 1,500 a year.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.548
Now you'd better ride off
before the Police are up.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.154
They'd wind of this
before we left Kilwangen.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.795
Come on, Redmond, I'll go home with you.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.588
<i>How different Barry's fate</i>
<i>might have been...</i>

25:06.200 --> 25:08.475
<i>... had he not fallen in love</i>
<i>with Nora...</i>

25:08.840 --> 25:11.957
<i>... and had he not flung the wine</i>
<i>in Captain Quin's face.</i>

25:12.800 --> 25:14.995
<i>But he was destined to be a wanderer.</i>

25:15.880 --> 25:19.634
<i>And the battle with Quin set him</i>
<i>on his travels at an early age...</i>

25:20.760 --> 25:22.398
<i>... as you shall soon see.</i>

25:22.640 --> 25:25.871
The boy must go into hiding
for a short time, anyway.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.238
Dublin's the best place for him.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.959
He can stay there
'til matters have blown over.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.437
But the child has never been
away from home before.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.356
Wouldn't he be as safe here?

25:38.560 --> 25:41.279
I wish that were true, Aunt Belle.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.797
But the Bailiffs may be
on their way already.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.117
Now, Dublin is five days ride
away from here.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.715
There's not a soul who'll know him there.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.878
I don't want to harp
on unpleasant matters...

25:55.280 --> 25:59.159
...but you do know what can happen
to him if he's taken.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.279
I'll be all right.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.876
I'll be all right in Dublin, Mother.

26:48.080 --> 26:52.517
<i>No lad with liberty for the first time,</i>
<i>and 20 guineas in his pocket...</i>

26:53.000 --> 26:54.228
<i>... is very sad.</i>

26:55.000 --> 26:58.072
<i>Barry rode towards Dublin</i>
<i>thinking not so much of...</i>

26:58.200 --> 27:01.510
<i>... the kind mother left alone,</i>
<i>and the home behind him...</i>

27:02.360 --> 27:05.511
<i>... but of tomorrow</i>
<i>and all the wonders it would bring.</i>

27:18.440 --> 27:19.714
Excuse me, miss.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.634
Would it be possible to have
a drink of water?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.952
Good day to you, young sir.

27:32.880 --> 27:33.869
Good day.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.192
Will you join us in a drink?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.513
No, thank you.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.951
Would you like something to eat?

27:54.400 --> 27:57.198
That's very kind of you,
but I have to be on my way.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.555
Thank you.

28:17.040 --> 28:17.995
Goodbye.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.033
Excuse me, sir.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.277
Good morning again, young sir.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.391
Don't even think about it.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.798
Get down off that horse.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.075
Raise your hands above your head, please.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.554
Come forward.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.910
Stop.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.311
How do you do. I'm Captain Feeney.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.748
Captain Feeney!

29:51.000 --> 29:53.355
Captain Feeney, at your service.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.759
The Captain Feeney?

29:56.600 --> 29:57.669
None other.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.748
May I introduce you to my son... Seamus?

30:06.440 --> 30:08.829
To whom do I have
the honour of speaking?

30:09.680 --> 30:11.318
My name's Redmond Barry.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.078
How do you do, Mr. Barry?

30:13.880 --> 30:18.158
Now we must get onto the more
regrettable stage of our brief acquaintance.

30:18.360 --> 30:22.319
Turn around and keep your hands
high above your head, please.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.874
There must be 20 guineas
in gold here, Father.

30:58.640 --> 31:02.918
You seem to be a very well set up
young gentleman, sir.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.710
Captain Feeney, that's all the money
my mother had in the world.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.358
Mightn't I keep it?

31:09.680 --> 31:12.035
I'm just one step ahead
of the Law myself.

31:12.240 --> 31:16.597
I killed an English Officer in a duel, and
I'm going to Dublin until things cool down.

31:16.680 --> 31:17.749
Mr. Barry...

31:18.160 --> 31:20.993
...in my profession
we hear many such stories.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.909
Yours is the most intriguing and touching
I've heard in weeks.

31:25.320 --> 31:28.039
Nevertheless,
I cannot grant your request.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.029
But, I'll tell you what I will do.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.791
I'll allow you to keep those fine boots,
which normally I would have for myself.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.319
The next town is only five miles away.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.069
And I suggest you now start walking.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.196
Mightn't I keep my horse?

31:44.600 --> 31:46.192
I would like to oblige you...

31:46.320 --> 31:50.598
...but, people like us must be able
to travel faster than our clients.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.439
Good day, young sir.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.589
You can put down your hands now,
Mr. Barry.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.437
Gale's Regiment of Foot, commanded
by Lieutenant General Charles Gale...

32:43.120 --> 32:47.272
...which has distinguished itself
during the recent troubles...

32:47.720 --> 32:51.315
...wants several men to supply
the places of those veterans...

32:51.400 --> 32:55.837
...who have deserved to be pensioned
at one shilling a day.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.758
All clever young fellows
who are free and able...

33:00.040 --> 33:04.477
...and are ambitious of becoming
gentlemen by bearing arms...

33:04.720 --> 33:07.712
...are hereby invited to meet
the Recruiting Officer...

33:08.240 --> 33:11.357
...who promises that they shall meet
with every encouragement...

33:11.440 --> 33:14.637
...that merit and good behaviour
can entitle them to.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.829
Those meeting the qualifications
will immediately receive...

33:19.080 --> 33:22.277
...His Majesty's Royal Bounty
of one and a half guineas...

33:22.600 --> 33:25.512
...with complete clothing, arms
and accoutrements.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.234
King George and Old England forever.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.756
<i>For a young man in difficulty...</i>

33:44.080 --> 33:48.517
<i>... who had killed a man in a duel and</i>
<i>was anxious to find refuge from the Law...</i>

33:49.040 --> 33:52.077
<i>... the chance to earn distinction</i>
<i>in the European wars...</i>

33:52.400 --> 33:54.550
<i>... seemed a stroke of good fortune.</i>

33:55.480 --> 33:59.268
<i>And King George needed men too much</i>
<i>to heed from whence they came.</i>

34:18.280 --> 34:19.998
Hey, lad! Lad!

34:22.520 --> 34:25.353
Can I have a new beaker?
This one is full of grease.

34:36.040 --> 34:40.192
Covered in grease! Give the gentleman
a towel and a basin of turtle soup.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.797
If you want to vex him,
ask him about his wife...

35:16.880 --> 35:18.916
...the washerwoman, who beats him.

35:19.440 --> 35:23.194
Mr. Toole, is it a towel
of your wife's washing?

35:23.640 --> 35:26.154
They say she wipes your face
often with one.

35:27.720 --> 35:31.030
Ask him why he wouldn't see her
yesterday when she came here.

35:31.360 --> 35:35.433
Mr. Toole, why did you hide
when Mrs. Toole came to visit you?

35:35.680 --> 35:37.671
Afraid of getting your ears boxed?

35:42.800 --> 35:46.236
Gentlemen, you may fight it out
with fists if you choose.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.394
We'll form a square for that purpose.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.669
Gentlemen, step this way, please.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.475
Shake hands.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.869
Shake hands.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.398
Take your stance.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.990
No biting, kicking or scratching.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.594
The last man to remain standing
is the winner.

36:24.120 --> 36:27.032
Gentlemen, commence fighting, now!

38:40.920 --> 38:44.071
<i>Barry's training continued at the camp.</i>

38:44.320 --> 38:47.471
<i>Within a month he was transformed</i>
<i>into a proper young soldier.</i>

38:50.080 --> 38:53.470
<i>The Regiment's strength</i>
<i>was steadily increased...</i>

38:53.800 --> 38:55.916
<i>... by the arrival of other troops...</i>

38:56.200 --> 38:59.510
<i>... in preparation for joining</i>
<i>their armies fighting in Germany.</i>

39:02.160 --> 39:03.354
<i>One occasion...</i>

39:03.760 --> 39:07.799
<i>... brought the welcome appearance</i>
<i>of his second in the fatal duel...</i>

39:08.680 --> 39:09.999
<i>... Captain Grogan.</i>

39:27.640 --> 39:31.076
It would have helped if we'd known
what had become of you.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.114
Didn't you think of writing
to your mother?

39:38.680 --> 39:39.749
Of course.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.234
But the shame I felt of losing
her money...

39:45.400 --> 39:47.470
...my father's sword and pistols...

39:49.200 --> 39:50.918
I couldn't tell her.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.034
She wouldn't care about those things.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.038
You are her only concern.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.637
Tonight you must write her
a proper letter.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.792
Tell her that you're safe and well.

40:06.680 --> 40:07.590
I will.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.199
Is Miss Brady well?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.955
There are only six Miss Bradys now.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.316
Has something happened to Nora?

40:32.600 --> 40:35.273
She took on so about your going away...

40:36.520 --> 40:39.318
...that she had to console herself
with a husband.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.112
She is now Mrs. John Quin.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.228
Mrs. John Quin?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.598
Was there another John Quin?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.355
No.

40:53.480 --> 40:56.278
The same, me boy.
He recovered from his wound.

40:58.880 --> 41:03.317
The shot you hit him with could not
hurt him. It was made of tow.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.195
Tow?

41:08.560 --> 41:12.269
The Bradys wouldn't let you kill
1,500 a year out of the family.

41:14.280 --> 41:18.512
The plan of the duel was arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.629
The cowardly Quin couldn't
be brought to marry...

41:22.320 --> 41:23.992
...from fear of you.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.719
But hit him you certainly did, me lad.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.829
With a fine thick plugget of tow.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.392
He was so frightened,
it took him an hour to come to.

41:38.280 --> 41:39.918
Are you in want of cash?

41:42.080 --> 41:46.232
You may draw on me. For I got
a couple of hundred from your uncle.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.674
While that lasts, you shall never want.

41:54.040 --> 41:58.318
<i>It would require a great historian</i>
<i>to explain the causes...</i>

41:58.800 --> 42:01.712
<i>... of the Seven Years' War in Europe...</i>

42:02.600 --> 42:05.273
<i>... to which Barry's regiment</i>
<i>was now on it's way.</i>

42:06.800 --> 42:10.395
<i>Let it suffice to say,</i>
<i>that England and Prussia were allies...</i>

42:10.960 --> 42:12.552
<i>... and at war against...</i>

42:12.760 --> 42:15.911
<i>... France, Sweden, Russia and Austria.</i>

42:29.880 --> 42:31.598
<i>Barry's first taste of battle...</i>

42:31.680 --> 42:34.797
<i>... was only a skirmish against</i>
<i>a rearguard of Frenchmen...</i>

42:35.360 --> 42:37.828
<i>... who occupied an orchard</i>
<i>beside a road...</i>

42:38.000 --> 42:41.515
<i>... down which the English main force</i>
<i>wished to pass.</i>

42:43.080 --> 42:45.548
<i>Though this encounter is not recorded</i>
<i>in any history book...</i>

42:46.720 --> 42:49.473
<i>... it was memorable enough</i>
<i>for those who took part.</i>

45:05.440 --> 45:08.113
I've only a hundred guineas
left to give you...

45:08.800 --> 45:11.030
...for I lost the rest at cards.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.077
Kiss me, me boy,
for we'll never meet again.

45:49.840 --> 45:53.958
<i>It is well to dream of glorious war</i>
<i>in a snug armchair.</i>

45:55.200 --> 45:58.078
<i>It is a different thing</i>
<i>to see it first hand.</i>

45:59.520 --> 46:03.798
<i>After his friend's death, Barry's thoughts</i>
<i>turned from military glory...</i>

46:05.000 --> 46:07.468
<i>... to those of escaping the Service...</i>

46:07.640 --> 46:10.200
<i>... to which he was tied for six years.</i>

46:23.840 --> 46:26.513
<i>Gentlemen talk of the Age of Chivalry...</i>

46:27.360 --> 46:31.319
<i>... but remember the ploughmen,</i>
<i>poachers and pickpockets they lead.</i>

46:32.360 --> 46:36.512
<i>It is with these sad instruments</i>
<i>great warriors and kings...</i>

46:37.120 --> 46:39.953
<i>... have been doing their murderous work</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

46:49.440 --> 46:52.750
<i>Barry could not have fallen</i>
<i>into worse circumstances...</i>

46:52.960 --> 46:55.269
<i>... than those in which he found himself.</i>

46:56.080 --> 46:59.709
<i>But fate did not intend he should</i>
<i>remain long an English soldier.</i>

47:00.520 --> 47:02.033
<i>An accident occurred...</i>

47:02.320 --> 47:05.676
<i>... which took him out of the Service</i>
<i>in a rather singular manner.</i>

47:33.200 --> 47:36.988
Freddie, I hope you won't be angry
with me, but...

47:37.760 --> 47:41.230
...I've got something to tell you
which you won't be happy about.

47:41.440 --> 47:42.839
What is it?

47:43.680 --> 47:46.831
First, promise me
you'll keep your temper.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.839
Jonathan, don't be an ass!
You're making a big mystery of it.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.993
What is going on?

47:55.240 --> 47:57.117
I have to go away again.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.438
For about two weeks.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.753
Oh, God, you're not serious?

48:03.640 --> 48:06.950
I am. There's nothing I can do about it.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.519
Where to this time?

48:10.000 --> 48:14.152
To Bremen, carrying important despatches
to Prince Henry.

48:15.200 --> 48:19.239
But you promised me last time
it would be never again.

48:19.760 --> 48:23.196
I know. And I've kept my part
of the bargain, but...

48:23.920 --> 48:27.071
...Pontersby insists I'm the only one
who can be entrusted with the trip.

48:27.160 --> 48:31.438
<i>Here was the opportunity to escape from</i>
<i>the Army for which he had been searching.</i>

48:32.960 --> 48:37.397
<i>It was only a few miles to the area</i>
<i>occupied by their Prussian allies...</i>

48:38.760 --> 48:41.194
<i>... where this Officer's uniform</i>
<i>and papers...</i>

48:41.280 --> 48:43.714
<i>... should allow him to travel</i>
<i>without suspicion...</i>

48:44.200 --> 48:47.875
<i>... and to stay ahead of the news</i>
<i>of his desertion.</i>

48:49.040 --> 48:51.395
Then, we'll have little time together.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.719
Are you cross with me?

48:55.280 --> 48:58.909
Damn you, I can't stay cross
with you for long.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.359
Oh, Jonathan...

49:03.200 --> 49:06.510
...at times like this I realize
how much I care for you...

49:06.880 --> 49:09.952
...and how empty life would be
without you.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.555
Frederick!

49:34.760 --> 49:39.072
<i>Barry was glad to see the uniforms</i>
<i>of the Prussian Infantry.</i>

49:40.880 --> 49:44.714
<i>They showed him that he was</i>
<i>out of English occupied territory.</i>

49:51.200 --> 49:53.555
<i>His intention was to make for Holland...</i>

49:53.720 --> 49:56.996
<i>... almost the only neutral country</i>
<i>in Europe, in those times...</i>

49:57.600 --> 49:59.989
<i>... and thence to get a passage home,</i>
<i>somehow.</i>

50:01.120 --> 50:02.394
<i>As he rode away...</i>

50:02.880 --> 50:05.713
<i>... Barry felt he was now</i>
<i>in his proper sphere.</i>

50:06.400 --> 50:10.234
<i>And determined never again</i>
<i>to fall from the rank of a gentleman.</i>

50:28.680 --> 50:29.999
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

50:31.040 --> 50:31.995
<i>Yes.</i>

50:32.600 --> 50:33.589
<i>Good day.</i>

50:34.400 --> 50:35.355
<i>Good day.</i>

50:37.320 --> 50:38.833
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

50:41.400 --> 50:43.072
I'm speaking little.

50:46.680 --> 50:50.275
I have not eaten all day, no food.

50:51.520 --> 50:54.671
Is there an inn nearby
where I might have a meal?

50:56.720 --> 50:58.551
No... I don't think so.

51:00.600 --> 51:04.434
There is nothing to eat before Grünberg.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.759
Do you live near here?

51:13.040 --> 51:14.029
<i>Yes.</i>

51:17.400 --> 51:21.791
Would you... feed me?
I'd be happy to pay you.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.029
I think so.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.918
Is it a boy or girl?

51:54.200 --> 51:55.155
A boy.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.474
What's his name?

51:59.680 --> 52:00.590
Peter.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.228
How old is he?

52:04.440 --> 52:05.873
He's one year old.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.112
Where is Peter's father?

52:13.520 --> 52:14.873
Where he is?

52:17.240 --> 52:18.150
Yes.

52:19.600 --> 52:20.828
In the war.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.358
How long has he been gone?

52:30.240 --> 52:32.708
Sorry... I didn't understand.

52:33.760 --> 52:34.590
What?

52:38.320 --> 52:39.912
Oh! A long time.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.118
Since springtime.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.195
It must be hard for you to be alone.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.030
It is.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.871
It must be dangerous for you in the war.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.996
I'm an Officer and must do my duty.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.439
You are sometimes...

53:23.840 --> 53:25.068
...Ionely?

53:27.880 --> 53:28.949
Sometimes.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.268
What did you say your name is?

53:50.440 --> 53:51.873
Lieutenant Fakenham.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.359
No, I mean...

53:55.400 --> 53:57.914
...what is the name before Fakenham?

53:59.720 --> 54:00.948
<i>My first name?</i>

54:02.360 --> 54:03.349
Jonathan.

54:08.520 --> 54:09.873
Would you like...

54:09.960 --> 54:11.359
...to stay with me?

54:12.040 --> 54:14.600
For a few days, or sometimes?

54:18.840 --> 54:20.478
That would be very nice.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.236
<i>Goodbye, my beautiful Lischen.</i>

54:58.880 --> 55:01.189
<i>Goodbye, Redmond.</i>

55:04.320 --> 55:05.389
<i>I love you.</i>

55:05.600 --> 55:06.715
<i>I love you.</i>

55:08.600 --> 55:09.999
<i>Look after yourself.</i>

55:14.440 --> 55:15.714
<i>God be with you.</i>

55:20.720 --> 55:24.235
<i>A lady who sets her heart</i>
<i>on a lad in uniform...</i>

55:25.120 --> 55:27.998
<i>... must be prepared to change lovers</i>
<i>pretty quickly...</i>

55:28.160 --> 55:30.230
<i>... or her life will be a sad one.</i>

55:32.160 --> 55:35.835
<i>This heart of Lischen's was like</i>
<i>many a neighboring town...</i>

55:36.880 --> 55:41.317
<i>... that had been stormed and occupied</i>
<i>many times before Barry came to invest it.</i>

56:05.720 --> 56:08.154
<i>During five years of war...</i>

56:09.160 --> 56:13.438
<i>... the illustrious Frederick had</i>
<i>so exhausted the males of his kingdom...</i>

56:13.960 --> 56:16.155
<i>... that he had to employ recruiters...</i>

56:16.560 --> 56:19.711
<i>... who would commit any crime,</i>
<i>including kidnapping...</i>

56:20.040 --> 56:24.318
<i>... to keep supplied those brilliant</i>
<i>regiments of his with cannon fodder.</i>

56:55.560 --> 56:56.879
Good evening, sir.

56:58.520 --> 57:02.149
I'm Captain Potzdorf.
To whom have I the honour of speaking?

57:03.760 --> 57:07.389
Good evening. I'm Lieutenant Fakenham,
Gale's Regiment of Foot.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.199
Pleased to meet you.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.676
Can we be of assistance to you?

57:13.840 --> 57:17.719
Thank you, but I am carrying urgent
despatches and must continue on my way.

57:18.760 --> 57:20.193
And your destination?

57:22.120 --> 57:23.075
Bremen.

57:25.320 --> 57:28.312
Then you're obviously lost, Lieutenant.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.670
Bremen is in the opposite direction.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.795
Are you sure?

57:31.880 --> 57:32.676
Yes.

57:34.680 --> 57:36.113
Wouldn't you know it!

57:36.840 --> 57:41.436
My departure was so hasty that
my orderly forgot to prepare proper maps.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.108
I understand.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.074
Please, do not be offended, Lieutenant...

57:50.120 --> 57:52.588
...but are you carrying
your identity papers?

57:54.760 --> 57:55.988
Yes, of course.

57:57.640 --> 57:58.868
May I see them?

58:02.040 --> 58:03.075
Of course.

58:08.680 --> 58:09.749
Thank you.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.749
Thank you, Lieutenant,
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.

58:27.680 --> 58:28.795
Not at all.

58:31.080 --> 58:33.753
Now that we are riding
in the same direction...

58:34.640 --> 58:38.633
...may I offer you a meal and a bed
for the night...

58:39.360 --> 58:41.430
...and a proper map for the journey?

58:43.880 --> 58:47.190
That's kind of you, Captain.
I'd be honoured to accept.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.794
<i>Barry was treated with great civility...</i>

59:13.600 --> 59:16.160
<i>... and was asked questions</i>
<i>about England.</i>

59:16.640 --> 59:20.952
<i>He answered as best he could,</i>
<i>inventing many stories.</i>

59:22.440 --> 59:24.317
<i>He described the King and Ministers...</i>

59:25.240 --> 59:28.516
<i>... boasted that the British Ambassador</i>
<i>in Berlin was his uncle...</i>

59:28.920 --> 59:31.753
<i>... and even offered Potzdorf</i>
<i>a letter of introduction.</i>

59:33.400 --> 59:36.153
<i>His host seemed satisfied</i>
<i>with these stories.</i>

59:36.960 --> 59:41.556
<i>But, he led Barry on with</i>
<i>a skillful combination of questions...</i>

59:42.360 --> 59:43.793
<i>... and flattery.</i>

59:44.000 --> 59:47.151
I know so little of your country
of England...

59:48.040 --> 59:50.759
...except that you are
the bravest nation in the world...

59:50.840 --> 59:53.798
...and that we are fortunate
to have such allies.

59:55.680 --> 59:57.193
Lieutenant Fakenham...

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.629
...let us drink to the friendship
of our two great nations.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.077
To our two great nations.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.148
Aren't you lucky,
going to Bremen tomorrow?

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.233
I know one of the loveliest women
in Europe there.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.277
Would you take a letter to her?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.069
Certainly.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.671
By the way, to whom are you carrying
your despatches?

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.193
General Williamson.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.119
General Williamson?

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.000
General Percival Williamson?

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.434
Yes, the same.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.598
<i>This man is under arrest.</i>

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.832
Under arrest? Captain Potzdorf, sir...

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.478
...I'm a British Officer.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.548
You're a liar and an imposter.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.199
You're a deserter.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.314
I suspected you this morning.
Your lies and folly have confirmed this.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.439
You pretend to carry despatches
to a General, dead these ten months.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.230
You say the British Ambassador in Berlin...

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.471
...is your uncle,
with the ridiculous name of O'Grady.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.750
Now, will you join and take the bounty,
or be given up?

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.548
I volunteer.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.869
<i>The Prussian Service was worse</i>
<i>than the English.</i>

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.350
<i>The life of a Private Soldier</i>
<i>was frightful.</i>

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.599
<i>Punishment was incessant.</i>
<i>Every Officer had the right to inflict it.</i>

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.749
<i>The gauntlet was a common penalty</i>
<i>for minor offences.</i>

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.078
<i>More serious ones were punishable</i>
<i>by mutilation or death.</i>

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.792
<i>At the close of the Seven Years' War</i>
<i>the army...</i>

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.718
<i>... renowned for its disciplined valour,</i>
<i>was officered by native Prussians.</i>

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.316
<i>But it was mostly composed...</i>

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.514
<i>... of men from the lowest levels</i>
<i>of humanity...</i>

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.350
<i>... hired or stolen</i>
<i>from every nation in Europe.</i>

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.239
<i>Thus, Barry fell</i>
<i>into the worst company...</i>

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:05.078
<i>... and was soon far advanced in</i>
<i>the science of every kind of misconduct.</i>

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.875
<i>Help.</i>

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.999
<i>Get me out of here.</i>

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.078
<i>The Colonel's speech declared</i>
<i>the King's satisfaction...</i>

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.792
<i>... with the conduct of the Regiment</i>
<i>at the Battle of Audorf...</i>

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.597
<i>... and with Corporal Barry's bravery</i>
<i>in rescuing Captain Potzdorf...</i>

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.149
<i>... which was to be rewarded</i>
<i>with the sum of two frederick d'or.</i>
