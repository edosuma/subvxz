CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE
BY CARSEY-WERNER
AND FOX BROADCASTING

00:10.969 --> 00:12.511
THE GAME IS ANACONDA.

00:12.679 --> 00:16.223
BIG ACE, 8 BALL, RED LADY,
JACKSON, FIVER, WILD MAN.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.809
OH, MY GOD. MICHAEL,
THEY OPENED UP A DISCO.

00:18.977 --> 00:19.685
WHERE AT?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.395
IN KENOSHA.

00:21.563 --> 00:26.108
YOU COULD WEAR YOUR
DAVID BOWIE BUTT-HUGGERS.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.779
MICHAEL,
THAT WOULD BE SUPER.

00:30.947 --> 00:31.655
LAUGH IF YOU WANT, MAN,

00:31.823 --> 00:34.575
BUT MY BUTT LOOKS
PRETTY GOOD IN THOSE.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.659
COME ON,
ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.536
I MEAN, A DISCO?
NO WAY.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.413
I DON'T KNOW, IT MIGHT BE
KIND OF FUN TO GO DANCING.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.789
OR WE COULD GO.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.416
I GOT NOTHING.
I FOLD.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.754
WELL, MAN, IF YOU'RE OUT,
GO MAKE SOME POPCORN.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.882
TAKE HER WITH YOU.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.843
WHAT IS DISCO?

00:53.011 --> 00:55.304
DISCO IS FROM HELL, OK,

00:55.472 --> 00:57.681
AND NOT THE COOL PART OF
HELL, WITH ALL THE MURDERERS,

00:57.849 --> 01:01.351
BUT THE LAME-ASS PART WHERE
THE REALLY BAD ACCOUNTANTS LIVE.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.103
EXCUSE ME,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.646
LOOKING AT
KELSO'S CARDS.

01:04.814 --> 01:05.272
THAT'S CHEATING.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.441
Jackie: ERIC, I CAN'T
FIND THE POPCORN.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.777
HEY, UM,

01:09.944 --> 01:11.779
DONNA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A LITTLE LOOK AT MY CARDS?

01:11.946 --> 01:13.322
THEN YOU WON'T HAVE
TO WAIT FOR ME TO LEAVE.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.490
NO, COME ON.
TAKE A LOOK.

01:14.657 --> 01:18.327
TAKE A LOOK. TELL ME WHAT
I HAVE, YOU CHEATER.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.453
YOU GOT NOTHING.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.498
YEAH, AND I'M GOING TO BLUFF,
SO WATCH OUT.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.377
DONNA HAS STUFF
FOR ERIC, YES?

01:27.545 --> 01:30.506
NOT STUFF, THING.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.133
DONNA HAS A THING
FOR ERIC.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.928
HA HA. WHY DO YOU
HAVE A THING FOR ERIC?

01:36.096 --> 01:39.932
HE MAKES ME LAUGH, HE DOESN'T
ASK ME STUPID QUESTIONS,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.226
HE'S SMART,
AND, YOU KNOW...

01:42.393 --> 01:43.435
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.105
I KNOW.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.733
IT IS BECAUSE ERIC IS NOBLE,

01:49.901 --> 01:51.318
AND A WOMAN WANTS
HER FIRST LOVEMAKING

01:51.486 --> 01:55.614
TO BE IN THE ARMS
OF A MAN SHE CAN TRUST.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.618

03:03.016 --> 03:03.849
WELL, NOW,
SHE IS INTERESTED.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.767
I CAN TELL.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.687
AND DANCING IS THE
QUICKEST WAY TO A GAL'S HEART.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.147
REMEMBER, RED,
WHEN WE USED TO GO DANCING

03:10.315 --> 03:12.399

YOU AND JACKIE

03:33.213 --> 03:35.589
ARE DRAGGING EVERYBODY
TO THAT DISCO.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.132
IT'S SO SAD.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.302

MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
GOING TO WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY

04:03.201 --> 04:07.496
ON A STUPID DISCO WHEN THEY
COULD BUY A REALLY BIG BAG...

04:07.664 --> 04:10.582
OF CARAMELS.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.918
NOT GOING TO
THAT DISCO, HUH?

04:13.086 --> 04:13.752
NO.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.587
PHONY PEOPLE LISTENING
TO CRAPPY MUSIC

04:15.755 --> 04:17.839
DOES NOT SOUND LIKE
MY KIND OF TIME.

04:18.007 --> 04:22.010
YOU CAN'T DANCE,
CAN YOU?

04:22.178 --> 04:23.512
I CAN DANCE.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.848
OH, I DON'T
THINK SO, PAL.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.685
I CAN DANCE.

04:29.852 --> 04:33.772
NOT ONE STEP.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.483
YOU'RE RIGHT.
NOT ONE STEP.

04:36.651 --> 04:40.529
WELL, THEN YOU
GOT A PROBLEM, SON,

04:40.697 --> 04:42.447
'CAUSE WOMEN
WANT TO DANCE.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.825
THEY ALWAYS
WANT TO DANCE.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.369
ALWAYS.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.496
WHY?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.790
BECAUSE THEY
CAN GET CLOSE

04:51.958 --> 04:54.710
AND WIGGLE THEIR BODIES
AROUND IN FRONT OF A MAN

04:54.877 --> 04:57.254
IN A SAFE
ATMOSPHERE.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.132
SEE, I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO WIGGLE AROUND IN PUBLIC.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.508
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.
YOU'RE A MAN.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.594
MY POINT IS YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.888
OTHERWISE,
LATER ON IN LIFE,

05:07.056 --> 05:11.560
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
WIGGLING ALL BY YOURSELF.

05:11.728 --> 05:16.523
NOW, IF YOU WANT,
I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.903
OK, NOW.
THAT WAS GOOD.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.238
OK, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.573
OK? NOW,

05:24.741 --> 05:28.994
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT,
TURN AND STEP.

05:29.162 --> 05:29.703
AHH.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.913
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH MUSIC,
MRS. FORMAN.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.457
NOW, LET'S NOT
GET DISCOURAGED.

05:33.624 --> 05:36.293
ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA
TURN THIS MUSIC OFF.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.586

HA HA HA HA.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.688
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT NOW,
NOW PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.522

SOMETHING TO SAY.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.132
I WENT
TO THE MALL TODAY,

07:47.300 --> 07:52.512
AND I BOUGHT A PAIR
OF NEW SHOES...

07:52.680 --> 07:56.933

I WOULD LIKE SOME TOAST
IF YOU ARE MAKING SOME,

08:04.775 --> 08:06.568
OR FOOD OF ANY KIND
WOULD BE GOOD.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.488
I AM STARVING.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.865

08:19.290 --> 08:22.792
THEY CAN ACTUALLY
THINK THEMSELVES TO DEATH, MAN.

08:27.048 --> 08:32.969
I HOPE I'M NOT
DOING THAT RIGHT NOW...

08:33.137 --> 08:34.304
'CAUSE MY MIND'S
ALWAYS DOING THINGS

08:34.472 --> 08:37.015
THAT I DON'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.770
MAN, WE ALWAYS THINK OF SO MANY
BRILLIANT THINGS DOWN HERE,

08:41.938 --> 08:44.356
BUT THEN LATER I CAN'T
REMEMBER ANY OF THEM,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.483

I'LL BET THAT'S HOW THE WRITERS
AT NATIONAL LAMPOON DO IT.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.419
