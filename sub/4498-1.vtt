04:23.503 --> 04:25.588
All right, Charlie.

04:25.672 --> 04:29.759
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- l already told you.

04:29.968 --> 04:32.137
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

04:32.262 --> 04:35.598
- What's the password?
- ''I've come to Grandma's funeral.''

04:35.682 --> 04:37.892
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

04:37.976 --> 04:41.521
lf you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

04:41.646 --> 04:43.732
We're all set. Whens the kickoff?

04:43.815 --> 04:46.943
I'd better blow.
lf Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.

04:47.068 --> 04:49.154
Goodbye, Charlie.

04:50.613 --> 04:53.616
Give me five minutes,
then hit 'em with everything you got.

04:53.742 --> 04:55.869
You betcha.

05:10.884 --> 05:12.344
Good evening, sir.

05:12.552 --> 05:16.181
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can l do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

05:16.306 --> 05:18.683
l haven't seen you at our services before.

05:18.808 --> 05:21.102
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

05:21.186 --> 05:23.813
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

05:23.897 --> 05:26.941
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

05:27.025 --> 05:29.444
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.

05:47.587 --> 05:50.173
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

05:50.382 --> 05:52.592
Follow me, please.

06:04.979 --> 06:06.981
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

06:07.065 --> 06:09.359
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

06:09.484 --> 06:12.404
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee...

06:12.487 --> 06:15.323
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

06:15.407 --> 06:19.160
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

06:19.285 --> 06:21.162
How about that one over there?

06:21.371 --> 06:25.333
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

06:35.010 --> 06:36.886
Oops.

06:42.726 --> 06:45.770
Hey, l want another cup of coffee.

06:45.854 --> 06:48.565
l want another cup of coffee.

06:59.409 --> 07:01.911
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

07:02.037 --> 07:06.291
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

07:29.856 --> 07:32.359
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

07:32.567 --> 07:36.029
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

07:36.112 --> 07:39.783
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

07:39.866 --> 07:42.911
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

07:42.994 --> 07:46.873
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

07:46.956 --> 07:51.336
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

07:51.544 --> 07:55.840
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

07:55.924 --> 08:00.011
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

08:00.095 --> 08:05.308
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.144
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

08:08.353 --> 08:11.523
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

08:11.564 --> 08:15.360
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1 .

08:15.568 --> 08:19.239
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.

08:19.322 --> 08:23.410
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?

08:23.493 --> 08:28.081
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

08:28.206 --> 08:31.126
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

08:31.209 --> 08:34.129
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.339
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

08:36.423 --> 08:40.176
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

08:53.106 --> 08:54.274
Four,

08:54.357 --> 08:55.734
three,

08:55.942 --> 08:57.277
two,

08:57.485 --> 08:58.653
one.

09:11.583 --> 09:15.128
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

09:15.211 --> 09:18.256
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

09:18.757 --> 09:21.801
l want another cup of coffee.

09:33.563 --> 09:35.357
All right, Spats.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.151
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

09:38.360 --> 09:42.322
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.

09:42.530 --> 09:45.450
- l don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

09:45.658 --> 09:50.246
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats - striped.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.500
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

09:53.583 --> 09:57.754
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

09:57.962 --> 09:59.964
Me? I'm just a customer.

10:00.048 --> 10:05.595
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own
the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

10:05.679 --> 10:09.974
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

10:10.183 --> 10:12.977
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

10:13.186 --> 10:15.897
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

10:18.108 --> 10:20.819
Buttermilk.

10:21.027 --> 10:23.613
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

10:23.822 --> 10:26.741
Come on. On your feet.

10:26.950 --> 10:30.829
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

10:30.912 --> 10:33.832
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

10:42.298 --> 10:45.010
l wan' another cuppa coffee.

11:23.381 --> 11:26.926
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

11:27.177 --> 11:29.971
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.807
At Moe's Deli no
more knockwurst on credit.

11:32.891 --> 11:36.227
We can't borrow from the girls -
they're on the way to jail.

11:36.436 --> 11:39.773
l wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

11:39.898 --> 11:44.569
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.

11:44.694 --> 11:47.822
- Jerry, l told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

11:47.906 --> 11:50.325
lt is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

11:50.533 --> 11:54.162
Look, stupid, he's 10-1 .
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.257
Greased Lightning.

12:06.383 --> 12:10.220
- l oughta have my head examined.
- l thought you weren't talkin' to me.

12:10.428 --> 12:13.682
The bull fiddle's
dressed warmer than l am.

12:20.438 --> 12:22.232
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

12:22.315 --> 12:23.983
Thank you.

12:26.486 --> 12:28.279
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

12:28.488 --> 12:30.031
Thank you.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.536
l can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
l got a fever, l got a hole in my shoe...

12:34.744 --> 12:37.455
lf you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

12:37.664 --> 12:39.749
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

12:39.958 --> 12:44.421
Galloping Ghost. He's 1 5-1 and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.132
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

12:47.340 --> 12:50.051
No, your bass.
lf we hock that and my sax...

12:50.260 --> 12:53.930
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

12:54.014 --> 12:57.142
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do l care? Freeze.

12:57.267 --> 12:59.978
- Anyzhing today?
- Oh, it's you.

13:00.061 --> 13:02.063
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

13:02.272 --> 13:04.149
Thank you.

13:04.357 --> 13:06.317
Joe. Come back here.

13:10.488 --> 13:13.950
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
l can explain.

13:14.159 --> 13:17.370
What a heel. l spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

13:17.495 --> 13:19.581
l buy me a brand-new negligee,

13:19.664 --> 13:21.750
l bake him a great big pizza pie.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.878
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

13:25.086 --> 13:26.254
- With you.
- Me?

13:26.463 --> 13:28.340
Remember? You had this bad tooth.

13:28.548 --> 13:30.717
lt was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

13:30.842 --> 13:31.885
lt was?

13:32.093 --> 13:34.054
Oh, yeah.

13:34.262 --> 13:37.724
- l took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

13:37.807 --> 13:40.643
- Type O.
- Oh?

13:40.727 --> 13:44.814
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.

13:44.898 --> 13:49.402
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

13:49.486 --> 13:53.365
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anyzhing for us? We're desperate.

13:53.448 --> 13:57.202
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

13:57.327 --> 13:58.995
And a sax.

13:59.079 --> 14:00.663
Right?

14:00.747 --> 14:02.207
Right.

14:02.332 --> 14:05.126

- Three weeks in Florida.

14:05.335 --> 14:09.214
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

14:09.422 --> 14:12.550
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

14:12.634 --> 14:16.304
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

14:16.388 --> 14:19.015
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

14:19.099 --> 14:21.518
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

14:21.601 --> 14:24.729
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

14:24.938 --> 14:28.692
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. l got a job for ya.

14:28.817 --> 14:30.485
Gladys. Are ya there?

14:30.694 --> 14:32.862
Gladys!

14:33.071 --> 14:36.116
Meshugeneh.
Played 1 1 2 hours at a marathon dance.

14:36.324 --> 14:39.661
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

14:39.744 --> 14:41.329
And Cora Jackson?

14:41.413 --> 14:44.999
Last l heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.210
Drexel 9044.

14:47.293 --> 14:49.295
Those idiot broads.

14:49.504 --> 14:53.258
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

14:53.341 --> 14:58.680
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

14:58.763 --> 15:00.765
Bienstock, l oughta fire you.

15:00.849 --> 15:04.102
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

15:04.310 --> 15:06.896
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

15:07.105 --> 15:09.607
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

15:09.733 --> 15:12.110
On the level?

15:12.318 --> 15:15.030
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

15:15.155 --> 15:18.908
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

15:19.534 --> 15:20.994
How about Rosemary Schultz?

15:21.077 --> 15:23.288
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

15:23.371 --> 15:27.125
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

15:27.250 --> 15:31.629
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.

15:31.838 --> 15:35.675
The moment anyzhing turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

15:35.884 --> 15:38.595
Bye, Sig. l wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

15:38.803 --> 15:41.014
Nellie, get me long-distance.

15:41.222 --> 15:45.602
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

15:45.685 --> 15:48.104
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

15:48.313 --> 15:50.607
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

15:50.815 --> 15:53.610
The William Morris Agency in New York.

15:53.735 --> 15:57.489
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

15:57.572 --> 15:58.948
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.

15:59.157 --> 16:01.659
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

16:01.868 --> 16:05.914
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

16:06.122 --> 16:07.499
What kind of a band is it?

16:07.707 --> 16:10.001
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

16:10.085 --> 16:11.670
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

16:11.878 --> 16:13.129
And you gotta be girls.

16:13.338 --> 16:14.464
No, we couldn't.

16:14.589 --> 16:17.717
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

16:17.801 --> 16:21.346
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
l could wring her neck.

16:21.554 --> 16:23.848
Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?

16:24.057 --> 16:27.185
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

16:27.394 --> 16:30.647
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

16:30.855 --> 16:33.983
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.152
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

16:36.361 --> 16:40.323
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could
borrow clothes from the chorus girls.

16:40.448 --> 16:43.785
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

16:43.868 --> 16:46.496
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.

16:46.579 --> 16:49.082
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

16:49.290 --> 16:52.544
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.

16:52.752 --> 16:55.255

17:04.097 --> 17:06.808
All the way to Urbana

17:06.933 --> 17:10.060
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

17:10.145 --> 17:13.815
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

17:13.897 --> 17:16.734
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

17:16.818 --> 17:18.403
A sax player and a bass?

17:18.611 --> 17:23.407
- lf William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

17:24.451 --> 17:27.579
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

17:27.662 --> 17:29.539
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

17:29.748 --> 17:32.167
Don't crowd me.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.795
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.631
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

17:39.341 --> 17:41.843
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

17:41.968 --> 17:45.722
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.

17:45.805 --> 17:49.267
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

17:49.476 --> 17:53.521
l just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.732
Then you'll be in all evening?

17:55.815 --> 17:57.609
Yes, Joe.

17:57.817 --> 17:59.903
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

17:59.986 --> 18:02.113
My car? Why, you...

18:04.949 --> 18:07.660
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

18:16.836 --> 18:20.382
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

18:20.465 --> 18:23.176
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...

18:23.301 --> 18:25.387
Knock it off, will ya?

18:28.515 --> 18:31.726
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

18:34.854 --> 18:36.856
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.234
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

18:39.442 --> 18:41.945
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.075
Musicians.

18:47.283 --> 18:48.618
Wise guys.

18:48.827 --> 18:51.246
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

18:51.329 --> 18:54.249
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.

18:54.457 --> 18:56.751
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

18:56.876 --> 19:01.881
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

19:01.965 --> 19:05.427
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

19:05.510 --> 19:08.138
And while you're at it, fill it up.

19:17.605 --> 19:20.233
All right, everybody. Hands up.

19:22.402 --> 19:24.404
Face the wall.

19:26.906 --> 19:28.992
You too, Toothpick.

19:29.075 --> 19:31.077
Come on.

19:32.829 --> 19:34.914
Come on.

19:45.550 --> 19:49.220
Hey. Join us.

20:00.357 --> 20:02.776
OK, boss.

20:15.163 --> 20:17.665
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

20:17.874 --> 20:21.836
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- l just dropped in to pay my respects.

20:22.045 --> 20:24.464
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- l wouldn't say that.

20:24.673 --> 20:27.175
You recommended
my mortuary to your friends.

20:27.258 --> 20:30.720
- l don't know what you mean.
- Now l got all those coffins on my hands.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.474
- l hate to see 'em go to waste.
- l had nothin' to do with it.

20:34.557 --> 20:38.645
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

20:42.691 --> 20:45.318
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

20:45.402 --> 20:47.487
No, Spats. Please, no.

20:53.868 --> 20:56.246
l think I'm gonna be sick.

21:01.668 --> 21:04.379
All right, come on outta there.

21:04.587 --> 21:06.172
Come on.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.675
Come on.

21:08.758 --> 21:13.471
- We didn't see anyzhing. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

21:13.555 --> 21:17.475
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

21:18.351 --> 21:21.855
Say... Don't l know you two
from somewhere?

21:21.938 --> 21:24.649
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

21:24.774 --> 21:27.485
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

21:27.694 --> 21:29.654
There's a dance tonight.

21:29.863 --> 21:32.157
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

21:32.365 --> 21:36.745
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

21:36.953 --> 21:38.830
You're not goin' nowhere.

21:41.332 --> 21:44.252
- We're not?
- l don't like no witnesses.

21:44.377 --> 21:47.714
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

21:47.922 --> 21:49.883
Not even air.

22:22.624 --> 22:27.128
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.977
l think they got me.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.271
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

22:45.355 --> 22:48.900
lf they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.666
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

23:04.749 --> 23:09.462
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

23:22.892 --> 23:25.186
Quick, gimme a nickel.

23:28.231 --> 23:29.899
You're gonna call the police?

23:29.983 --> 23:33.445
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

23:33.653 --> 23:36.156
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

23:36.364 --> 23:38.867
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

23:38.950 --> 23:42.704
At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

23:42.829 --> 23:45.206
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?

23:47.083 --> 23:49.794
Hello. Mr Poliakoff?

23:49.919 --> 23:53.548
l understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

24:10.440 --> 24:14.319
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,

24:14.402 --> 24:17.739
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.

24:17.864 --> 24:20.367
All aboard.

24:28.792 --> 24:29.834
What now?

24:29.959 --> 24:32.796
How do they keep their
balance in these things?

24:32.962 --> 24:36.883
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

24:36.966 --> 24:39.052
lt is so draughty.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.262
They must catch cold all the time.

24:41.346 --> 24:44.265
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- l feel naked.

24:44.474 --> 24:48.645
- l feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

24:58.238 --> 25:01.074
It's no use. We're not gonna
get away with it, Joe.

25:01.282 --> 25:05.036
My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

25:28.268 --> 25:31.521
Look at that. Look how she moves.

25:31.604 --> 25:34.232
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

25:34.441 --> 25:37.652
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

25:37.861 --> 25:40.071
l tell ya, it's a whole different sex.

25:40.155 --> 25:42.866
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

25:42.991 --> 25:46.119
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.079
You will not talk me into...

25:48.204 --> 25:52.042
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

25:52.167 --> 25:54.669
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

25:54.753 --> 25:59.466
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.385
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

26:02.469 --> 26:04.471
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

26:04.554 --> 26:06.973
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

26:09.893 --> 26:12.604
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

26:12.687 --> 26:15.523
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

26:15.607 --> 26:19.778
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

26:20.403 --> 26:22.280
My name is Josephine.

26:22.489 --> 26:24.699
I'm Daphne.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.953
Saxophone, bass. Am l glad to see
you girls. You saved our lives.

26:29.079 --> 26:30.830
Likewise, I'm sure.

26:31.039 --> 26:33.041
Where did you girls play before?

26:33.124 --> 26:36.378
Here, there and... around, and...

26:36.586 --> 26:40.840
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.259
All aboard.

26:43.343 --> 26:45.428
You're in berths 7 and 7A.

26:45.553 --> 26:46.596
7 and 7A.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.682
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

26:48.890 --> 26:50.850
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

26:52.310 --> 26:55.230
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

26:55.355 --> 26:58.274
Looks like Poliakoff sent
a couple of real ladies.

26:58.358 --> 27:01.695
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

27:11.204 --> 27:12.664
What are you...?

27:12.747 --> 27:14.416
Daphne?

27:14.624 --> 27:17.460
l never did like the name Geraldine.

27:24.134 --> 27:27.345
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

27:29.222 --> 27:31.725
My name is Josephine. Sax.

27:32.559 --> 27:36.438
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

27:36.646 --> 27:40.066
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, l don't wear one myself.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.277
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

27:42.360 --> 27:45.905
l have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

27:46.031 --> 27:49.617
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

27:49.784 --> 27:53.163
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

27:53.246 --> 27:56.166
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

27:56.291 --> 28:00.337
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

28:00.462 --> 28:04.299
They went to a conservatory.

28:07.761 --> 28:10.764
How about that talent, huh?

28:10.889 --> 28:13.683
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

28:13.808 --> 28:17.979
When l was a kid, Joe, l dreamed l was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

28:18.188 --> 28:20.273
And there was goodies all around.

28:20.482 --> 28:25.070
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

28:25.153 --> 28:28.615
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

28:28.698 --> 28:30.784
Yeah, sure, Joe.

28:30.909 --> 28:33.620
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

28:35.372 --> 28:37.582
Now you've done it.

28:37.791 --> 28:41.628
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

28:41.753 --> 28:45.090
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

28:53.223 --> 28:55.100
This way, Daphne.

28:55.308 --> 28:58.228
Now you tore the other one.

29:10.407 --> 29:12.075
Terribly sorry.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.369
It's OK. l was scared it was Sweet Sue.

29:14.577 --> 29:17.080
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

29:17.205 --> 29:20.542
lf they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.587
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

29:24.713 --> 29:26.798
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

29:26.881 --> 29:28.883
This is Joe... sephine.

29:29.092 --> 29:30.844
Come in.

29:31.052 --> 29:32.846
I'm Sugar Cane.

29:32.929 --> 29:35.974
- Sugar Cane?
- l changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

29:36.057 --> 29:39.936
- Polish?
- Yes. l come from this musical family.

29:40.020 --> 29:42.939
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

29:43.064 --> 29:46.818
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

29:49.404 --> 29:52.449
l play the ukulele, and l sing, too.

29:52.657 --> 29:56.077
l don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

29:56.286 --> 29:58.163
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.

29:58.288 --> 30:02.334
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

30:02.542 --> 30:05.170
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

30:05.253 --> 30:08.089
I'll take a rain check.

30:09.132 --> 30:13.303
l don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
l can stop if l want to, only l don't want to.

30:13.386 --> 30:16.097
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

30:16.306 --> 30:20.268
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

30:20.393 --> 30:23.521
l always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

30:28.818 --> 30:30.487
Are my seams straight?

30:30.695 --> 30:32.781
I'll say.

30:34.157 --> 30:37.369
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

30:37.494 --> 30:39.871
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.791
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

30:42.916 --> 30:45.835
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

30:45.919 --> 30:49.172
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

30:49.255 --> 30:52.509
Boy, would l love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

30:52.592 --> 30:54.177
Look...

30:54.386 --> 30:58.431
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.934
You tore 'em again.

31:39.556 --> 31:43.226
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

31:43.435 --> 31:45.395
No. Funerals.

31:45.603 --> 31:49.482
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

31:49.691 --> 31:51.568
We'll try.

31:51.651 --> 31:54.696
How did those holes get there?

31:54.904 --> 31:57.407
Those?

31:57.490 --> 31:59.492
l don't know.

31:59.701 --> 32:01.161
Mice?

32:01.244 --> 32:05.540
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.

33:10.897 --> 33:12.982
Bienstock!

33:13.608 --> 33:15.193
Yes, Sue?

33:15.402 --> 33:19.364
l thought l made it clear
that l don't want any drinking in this outfit.

33:25.078 --> 33:27.580
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

33:27.706 --> 33:29.791
Come on, now. Speak up.

33:29.999 --> 33:32.502
- Sugar, l warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.839
I've had it. ln Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

33:36.047 --> 33:38.341
Before that you had
a pint in your ukelele...

33:38.425 --> 33:40.218
Mr Bienstock, could l have my flask?

33:40.301 --> 33:43.221
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

33:43.430 --> 33:47.308
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.643
Give me that.

33:48.768 --> 33:51.688
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

33:51.771 --> 33:55.942
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- l thought you said three years.

33:56.151 --> 33:58.862
We got time off for good behaviour.

33:58.987 --> 34:04.909
There are two things l will not put up with
during working hours: liquor and men.

34:05.535 --> 34:08.246
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

34:08.371 --> 34:10.456
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

34:10.665 --> 34:13.877
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

34:14.002 --> 34:17.213
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

34:17.339 --> 34:20.300
l beg your pardon, miss.

34:20.342 --> 34:23.428
All right, girls. From the top again.

35:02.008 --> 35:04.719
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.222
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.182
Good night, Gloria.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.893
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

35:13.061 --> 35:16.481
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

35:18.358 --> 35:21.069
How about that ''toodle-oo''.

35:21.194 --> 35:25.365
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.

35:25.448 --> 35:28.159
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

35:28.368 --> 35:31.705
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

35:32.038 --> 35:33.581
I'm a...

35:37.335 --> 35:40.046
Get a load of that rhyzhm section.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.257
I'm a girl.

35:42.465 --> 35:44.426
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

35:44.634 --> 35:46.636
I'm a girl.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.181
Good night, Sugar.

35:54.019 --> 35:56.312
Good night, honey.

35:57.355 --> 36:00.400
Honey? Hey, she called me ''honey''.

36:00.483 --> 36:02.152
Ooh, honey.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.697
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.

36:05.822 --> 36:08.116
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.453
Supposin' l gotta go...
like for a drink of water or something.

36:11.661 --> 36:14.039
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose l lose.

36:14.164 --> 36:18.001
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

36:19.461 --> 36:23.548
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

36:23.631 --> 36:27.385
- Funny? ln what way?
- l don't know, but l can feel it right here.

36:27.594 --> 36:31.264
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

36:31.473 --> 36:34.184
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

36:34.267 --> 36:38.563
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

36:38.646 --> 36:41.483
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

36:50.116 --> 36:52.952
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.829
l wish l were dead.

36:55.038 --> 36:59.000
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

37:41.459 --> 37:42.419
Daphne.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.723
Sugar.

37:54.931 --> 37:58.893
l wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

38:01.271 --> 38:03.273
It's nothing.

38:03.356 --> 38:05.567
l just thought that
us girls should stick together.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.695
lf it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

38:08.778 --> 38:11.906
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

38:13.283 --> 38:15.160
It's freezing outside.

38:15.368 --> 38:18.288
l mean, when l think about you
and your poor ukulele...

38:18.496 --> 38:20.999
lf there's ever anyzhing l can do for you...

38:21.207 --> 38:23.710
l can think of a million things.

38:26.421 --> 38:28.798
That's one of 'em.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.509
It's Sweet Sue.

38:43.188 --> 38:45.398
l don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

38:45.482 --> 38:49.152
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

38:49.235 --> 38:52.364
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

38:52.489 --> 38:55.075
You stay here as long as you like.

38:57.786 --> 38:59.871
I'm not crowding you, am l?

38:59.996 --> 39:02.082
No. It's nice and cosy.

39:03.333 --> 39:07.796
When l was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

39:08.004 --> 39:11.549
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

39:11.758 --> 39:14.386
and were trying to find our way out.

39:14.469 --> 39:16.888
Very interesting.

39:18.223 --> 39:21.267
- Anyzhing wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

39:23.144 --> 39:25.647
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

39:25.855 --> 39:27.816
That's ridiculous.

39:28.024 --> 39:30.652
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

39:31.361 --> 39:34.197
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

39:34.280 --> 39:36.366
Here, let me warm them up a little.

39:36.491 --> 39:40.453
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

39:40.537 --> 39:42.831
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

39:43.039 --> 39:45.875
- I'd better go before l catch something.
- Not that sick.

39:45.959 --> 39:47.961
I've got very low resistance.

39:48.044 --> 39:51.923
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

39:52.132 --> 39:55.051
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

39:55.135 --> 39:58.054
- You've got some?
- l know where to get it.

39:58.179 --> 39:59.723
Don't move.

40:00.473 --> 40:02.767
- Hold on.
- OK.

40:24.539 --> 40:26.541
Up. Up.

40:32.047 --> 40:34.257
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.385
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

40:38.845 --> 40:40.930
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

40:51.358 --> 40:55.111
Oh, l tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

40:55.236 --> 40:57.947
Put on the lights.
l can't see what I'm doing.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.575
No lights. We don't want them to know.

41:00.784 --> 41:03.286
- But l might spill some.
- So spill it.

41:03.495 --> 41:06.414
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.209
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.711
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.339
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

41:14.422 --> 41:16.508
That'll put hair on your chest.

41:16.633 --> 41:18.718
No fair guessing.

41:20.053 --> 41:22.055
Is this a private clambake?

41:22.138 --> 41:24.140
It's private. Please, go away.

41:24.224 --> 41:26.518
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

41:26.643 --> 41:28.311
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

41:28.395 --> 41:31.439
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.733
Manhattans? At this time of night?

41:33.817 --> 41:36.444
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.613
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

41:40.281 --> 41:42.909
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

41:42.992 --> 41:47.080
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

41:47.163 --> 41:49.457
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

41:49.582 --> 41:51.459
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

41:51.668 --> 41:54.170
Go get some paper cups.

41:54.254 --> 41:56.881
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

42:01.761 --> 42:05.098
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.934
l brought some cheese and crackers.

42:08.018 --> 42:11.896
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

42:13.231 --> 42:17.527
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

42:18.653 --> 42:21.990
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbours downstairs.

42:22.615 --> 42:24.617
Watch that corkscrew.

42:24.826 --> 42:27.829
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

42:27.954 --> 42:30.457
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

42:30.540 --> 42:32.542
Here's the cocktail shaker.

42:32.751 --> 42:35.962
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

42:36.171 --> 42:40.258
1 3 girls in a berth is bad luck.
1 2 of you will have to get out.

42:40.342 --> 42:43.803
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

42:43.887 --> 42:46.306
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

42:47.640 --> 42:51.603
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

42:51.811 --> 42:53.813
Never mind.

42:59.861 --> 43:01.821
Maraschino cherries?

43:10.997 --> 43:12.582
What's going on here?

43:12.665 --> 43:16.419
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

43:17.045 --> 43:20.090
It's not my fault. l didn't invite 'em.

43:20.173 --> 43:22.676
Come on, girls, break it up.

43:22.801 --> 43:26.638
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.

43:27.597 --> 43:30.100
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

43:30.308 --> 43:32.268
Get out.

43:32.477 --> 43:35.188
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

43:36.856 --> 43:39.567
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

43:39.693 --> 43:43.238
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

43:43.321 --> 43:45.949
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.

43:46.032 --> 43:49.285
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

43:50.203 --> 43:53.456
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

44:00.213 --> 44:02.507
Put it here.

44:02.632 --> 44:05.010
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

44:05.218 --> 44:06.886
You'd better keep a lookout.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.139
lf Bienstock catches you again...

44:09.180 --> 44:11.433
What's the matter with you, anyway?

44:11.516 --> 44:13.518
I'm not very bright, l guess.

44:13.727 --> 44:15.895
l wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

44:16.104 --> 44:20.900
No, just dumb. lf l had any brains, l
wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

44:21.109 --> 44:22.902
Well, why'd you take this job?

44:22.986 --> 44:25.822
l used to sing with male bands,
but l can't afford it any more.

44:25.905 --> 44:28.408
Have you ever been with a male band?

44:28.533 --> 44:29.993
Who, me?

44:30.076 --> 44:31.661
That's what I'm running away from.

44:31.870 --> 44:35.415
l worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

44:35.623 --> 44:37.500
- Rough?
- I'll say.

44:37.709 --> 44:40.628
- You can't trust those guys.
- l can't trust myself.

44:40.712 --> 44:43.340
l have this thing about saxophone players.

44:43.423 --> 44:45.425
Especially tenor sax.

44:47.385 --> 44:50.930
- Really?
- l don't know why, but they curdle me.

44:51.139 --> 44:54.601
All they have to do is play eight bars of
''Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby''

44:54.809 --> 44:58.563
and l get goose-pimply all over,
and l come to 'em.

44:58.646 --> 45:00.940
- That so?
- Every time.

45:02.609 --> 45:04.819
You know, l play tenor sax.

45:04.903 --> 45:08.865
But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why l joined this band.

45:08.990 --> 45:13.244
Safety first. Anyzhing
to get away from those bums.

45:13.370 --> 45:16.581
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.

45:16.706 --> 45:19.709
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

45:19.918 --> 45:22.337
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

45:22.420 --> 45:25.674
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

45:25.882 --> 45:27.217
You don't say.

45:27.425 --> 45:30.679
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

45:30.887 --> 45:35.475
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

45:35.684 --> 45:40.063
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

45:40.146 --> 45:42.357
It's the same thing all over again.

45:42.565 --> 45:46.194
You see what l mean? Not very bright.

45:46.403 --> 45:48.488
Brains aren't everyzhing.

45:49.239 --> 45:52.784
l can tell you one thing. It's not
gonna happen to me again - ever.

45:52.867 --> 45:55.912
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

45:55.995 --> 46:00.083
lce. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

46:00.166 --> 46:03.003
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

46:04.337 --> 46:07.590
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

46:07.674 --> 46:10.385
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

46:10.510 --> 46:12.178
- About what?
- The future.

46:12.262 --> 46:15.724
You know - like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.

46:15.932 --> 46:19.144
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

46:19.269 --> 46:21.646
They all go south for the winter, like birds.

46:21.855 --> 46:25.108
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- l don't care how rich he is.

46:25.191 --> 46:29.362
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

46:29.487 --> 46:32.615
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

46:32.699 --> 46:36.578
With money like Rockefeller and
shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

46:36.661 --> 46:39.372
- l want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

46:39.497 --> 46:43.460
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

46:43.543 --> 46:46.796
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

46:47.005 --> 46:49.591
They get those weak eyes from reading.

46:49.799 --> 46:54.304
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

46:55.013 --> 46:58.141
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

46:58.266 --> 47:01.186
Hot-diggety-dog.

47:01.269 --> 47:03.772
Well, happy days.

47:03.980 --> 47:09.527
l hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

47:11.279 --> 47:13.365
So the one-legged jockey said...

47:13.490 --> 47:15.575
What did he say?

47:15.658 --> 47:21.289
So the one-legged jockey said: ''Don't
worry about me, baby. l ride side-saddle.''

47:28.213 --> 47:30.840
I'm terribly sorry. l seem to have hiccups.

47:30.924 --> 47:33.343
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

47:33.426 --> 47:35.512
l think... Ow. You dropped it.

47:35.637 --> 47:37.305
Oh, that's cold.

47:37.514 --> 47:41.142
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

47:44.688 --> 47:47.399
Help. Please. Help. Help.

47:47.524 --> 47:48.858
Josephine.

47:48.983 --> 47:52.529
Please stop that. Stop that.

48:03.164 --> 48:05.250
- What happened?
- Search me.

48:05.333 --> 48:07.335
l mean, I'll see.

48:17.846 --> 48:20.265
All right, what's goin' on around here?

48:20.557 --> 48:22.350
Bienstock!

48:23.268 --> 48:25.353
Are we in Florida?

49:10.398 --> 49:11.983
Sugar?

49:12.067 --> 49:14.486
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

49:14.694 --> 49:17.072
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

49:17.197 --> 49:19.491
Isn't she a sweetheart?

49:25.747 --> 49:27.707
How do you do?

49:30.835 --> 49:32.087
Zowie!

49:32.295 --> 49:35.757
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

49:35.965 --> 49:37.842
l bet there isn't one under 75.

49:37.926 --> 49:41.262
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

49:41.471 --> 49:44.099
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

49:44.182 --> 49:45.767
Yes.

49:54.818 --> 49:56.820
Pardon me, miss.

49:58.571 --> 50:00.573
- May l?
- Help yourself.

50:00.782 --> 50:03.493
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

50:03.576 --> 50:05.662
I'm Cinderella the Second.

50:05.787 --> 50:10.375
lf there's one thing l admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

50:11.084 --> 50:13.086
Me, too. Bye-bye.

50:13.586 --> 50:16.715
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

50:16.923 --> 50:19.342
Aren't you a sweetheart.

50:24.139 --> 50:27.350
lt certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

50:27.559 --> 50:28.935
Personally, I'm type O.

50:29.144 --> 50:31.730
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

50:31.938 --> 50:33.314
ls that so?

50:33.398 --> 50:36.735
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

50:36.860 --> 50:39.654
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

50:39.863 --> 50:42.741
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

50:42.907 --> 50:44.826
Mama is keeping score.

50:45.035 --> 50:47.746
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- l wouldn't wonder.

50:47.954 --> 50:51.708
So when George White's Scandals
opened, she packed me off to Florida.

50:51.791 --> 50:56.588
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

50:57.547 --> 51:01.926
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

51:03.261 --> 51:06.306
lf l promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

51:06.514 --> 51:09.517
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

51:09.726 --> 51:12.228
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

51:12.354 --> 51:13.813
Oh, fascinating.

51:13.897 --> 51:16.191
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

51:17.233 --> 51:20.362
Most of the time, l slap it.

51:20.487 --> 51:22.989
You must be quite a girl.

51:23.073 --> 51:24.866
Wanna bet?

51:25.075 --> 51:28.828
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

51:28.912 --> 51:32.374
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

51:32.457 --> 51:33.917
Zowie!

51:34.042 --> 51:36.127
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

51:36.211 --> 51:38.421
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

51:40.715 --> 51:42.801
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

51:42.884 --> 51:45.929
- This is where l get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

51:46.137 --> 51:48.098
You don't get off that easy.

51:48.306 --> 51:50.809
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

51:51.017 --> 51:53.436
And keep your eyes on the road.

52:02.821 --> 52:05.740
What kind of a girl
do you think l am, Mr Fielding?

52:07.200 --> 52:10.328
- Oh, please. lt won't happen again.
- I'll say.

52:10.537 --> 52:13.039
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

52:13.123 --> 52:15.208
Please, miss...

52:17.836 --> 52:19.295
Zowie!

52:19.921 --> 52:22.424
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

52:22.632 --> 52:25.343
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

52:26.469 --> 52:28.555
Olga and Mary Lou are in 41 2.

52:28.763 --> 52:32.225
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono
when you ring for room service.

52:32.308 --> 52:34.519
Josephine and Daphne are in 41 3.

52:34.602 --> 52:37.647
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

52:37.856 --> 52:40.150
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

52:40.358 --> 52:41.901
Rosella and Emily in 41 5...

52:42.861 --> 52:45.155
- l wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do l.

52:45.363 --> 52:48.908
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

52:50.243 --> 52:54.539
414... That's the same room number
l had in Cincinnati,

52:54.748 --> 52:56.833
my last time around with a male band.

52:56.916 --> 52:58.793
What a heel he was.

52:58.918 --> 53:02.672
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was l ever crazy about him.

53:02.756 --> 53:05.675
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

53:05.884 --> 53:08.595
They were out of potato salad,
so l brought coleslaw.

53:08.720 --> 53:12.474
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

53:12.557 --> 53:15.268
You're gonna meet
a millionaire - a young one.

53:15.393 --> 53:18.813
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

53:27.072 --> 53:29.032
Oh. Are these your bags?

53:30.492 --> 53:33.411
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

53:34.454 --> 53:37.999
- l suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

53:38.124 --> 53:43.213
After all, you work here and l work here.
It's nice to have you with the organisation.

53:43.421 --> 53:45.632
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

53:45.840 --> 53:48.635
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

53:48.760 --> 53:51.971
I'm workin' the night shift and
l got a bottle of gin stashed away.

53:52.180 --> 53:55.642
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

53:55.725 --> 53:59.646
Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?

54:00.480 --> 54:05.485
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way l like 'em - big and sassy.

54:06.319 --> 54:08.613
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.

54:23.712 --> 54:25.505
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

54:25.588 --> 54:28.842
- l got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

54:29.050 --> 54:30.510
I'm not even pretty.

54:30.593 --> 54:34.889
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

54:34.973 --> 54:37.809
I'm sick of being the flag.
l wanna be a bull again.

54:37.892 --> 54:39.894
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

54:40.103 --> 54:43.440
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

54:43.523 --> 54:47.193
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

54:47.402 --> 54:52.615
Spats Colombo is looking for us
in every male band in the country.

54:52.699 --> 54:56.036
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

54:56.244 --> 54:58.955
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

54:59.080 --> 55:01.041
But how long can we keep this up?

55:01.166 --> 55:03.668
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.

55:03.877 --> 55:07.297
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

55:07.422 --> 55:09.716
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

55:09.924 --> 55:12.093
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

55:12.218 --> 55:14.721
l know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

55:14.804 --> 55:17.724
- Me, after Sugar?
- l saw the both of you in that bus.

55:17.849 --> 55:21.811
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

55:21.895 --> 55:24.522
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

55:24.731 --> 55:28.360
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

55:28.485 --> 55:31.071
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

55:32.030 --> 55:34.407
Are you decent?

55:39.120 --> 55:41.081
Come in.

55:41.831 --> 55:44.959
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

55:45.043 --> 55:46.711
lt has all my resort clothes.

55:46.836 --> 55:49.339
- No, we haven't.
- l can't understand it.

55:49.422 --> 55:52.133
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

55:52.258 --> 55:54.219
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

55:54.344 --> 55:58.932
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

55:59.015 --> 56:02.894
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

56:03.103 --> 56:05.814
You haven't got a bathing suit.

56:05.897 --> 56:07.774
l don't have one either.

56:07.982 --> 56:11.861
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

56:11.945 --> 56:15.490
- How about you, Josephine?
- l think I'll soak in a hot tub.

56:15.615 --> 56:19.786
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

56:19.869 --> 56:23.206
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

56:23.331 --> 56:28.753
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

57:30.607 --> 57:34.694
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

57:34.903 --> 57:37.822
Just a little trick
l picked up in the elevator.

57:37.906 --> 57:41.034
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

58:11.272 --> 58:14.317
Daphne. l had no idea
you were such a big girl.

58:14.401 --> 58:17.112
You should've seen me
before l went on a diet.

58:17.320 --> 58:19.322
l mean your shoulders and your arms.

58:19.531 --> 58:21.700
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

58:21.908 --> 58:24.327
- There's one thing l envy you for.
- What's that?

58:24.536 --> 58:26.496
You're so flat-chested.

58:26.705 --> 58:29.541
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

58:29.624 --> 58:31.626
Watch out, Daphne.

58:31.835 --> 58:34.337
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

58:35.797 --> 58:37.549
Junior, time for your nap.

58:37.757 --> 58:39.968
No. l wanna play.

58:40.176 --> 58:42.345
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

58:42.554 --> 58:45.265
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

58:45.390 --> 58:47.559
Mommy!

58:47.767 --> 58:49.019
Here we go.

58:49.144 --> 58:52.147
l like coffee, l like tea.

58:52.355 --> 58:56.026
How many boys are stuck on me?

58:56.526 --> 58:59.362
One, two, three,

58:59.571 --> 59:02.782
four, five, six, seven...

59:09.039 --> 59:11.750
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

59:11.875 --> 59:14.252
- l don't think so.
- l wish you'd make sure.

59:14.461 --> 59:16.463
Because when people find out who l am,

59:16.671 --> 59:21.468
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

59:21.676 --> 59:25.096
- l won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

59:27.515 --> 59:29.476
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

59:31.895 --> 59:33.355
Sugar!

59:33.855 --> 59:35.732
Come on.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.108
Honestly.

59:38.443 --> 59:40.236
Cheerio.

59:45.116 --> 59:48.161
- Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

59:48.244 --> 59:50.747
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

59:50.955 --> 59:52.957
Your face is familiar.

59:53.041 --> 59:55.669
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

59:55.752 --> 59:58.588
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

59:58.672 --> 01:00:02.342
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:03.593
Of what?

01:00:03.802 --> 01:00:07.847
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

01:00:08.056 --> 01:00:10.058
You own a yacht?

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:12.977
Which one is it? The big one?

01:00:13.687 --> 01:00:14.729
Certainly not.

01:00:14.938 --> 01:00:19.651
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 1 2.

01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:21.736
l quite agree.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.030
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

01:00:24.114 --> 01:00:26.825
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

01:00:27.033 --> 01:00:30.161
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

01:00:30.286 --> 01:00:32.414
No, my cocktail steward.

01:00:32.497 --> 01:00:34.916
Look, if you're interested in
whether l am married or not...

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:37.919
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

01:00:38.545 --> 01:00:41.256
That's very interesting.

01:00:43.967 --> 01:00:46.803
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

01:00:46.886 --> 01:00:49.597
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

01:00:49.806 --> 01:00:51.808
Could be. You play the market?

01:00:51.891 --> 01:00:55.145
- No, the ukulele. And l sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

01:00:55.353 --> 01:00:57.313
We are appearing at the hotel.

01:00:57.439 --> 01:00:59.607
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

01:00:59.733 --> 01:01:03.903
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

01:01:04.112 --> 01:01:06.197
We're just doing this for a lark.

01:01:06.823 --> 01:01:10.994
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

01:01:11.077 --> 01:01:13.788
Yeah. Real hot.

01:01:13.913 --> 01:01:17.459
l guess some like it hot.
l personally prefer classical music.

01:01:18.293 --> 01:01:19.210
l do, too.

01:01:19.419 --> 01:01:24.549
As a matter of fact, l spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

01:01:24.632 --> 01:01:28.511
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

01:01:28.595 --> 01:01:32.057
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.933
But l don't care. lt was such a bore.

01:01:34.017 --> 01:01:36.436
- Coming-out parties.
- lnauguration balls.

01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:38.521
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.524
And always the same 400.

01:01:41.733 --> 01:01:44.444
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:47.572
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

01:01:47.697 --> 01:01:51.451
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

01:01:51.534 --> 01:01:52.994
l beg your pardon?

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:55.705
You see, l have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

01:01:55.914 --> 01:01:59.167
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when l know you better.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:01.961
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

01:02:02.087 --> 01:02:05.090
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

01:02:05.298 --> 01:02:08.134
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

01:02:08.218 --> 01:02:11.680
l only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

01:02:11.763 --> 01:02:14.599
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

01:02:14.808 --> 01:02:17.727
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

01:02:17.936 --> 01:02:20.438
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

01:02:20.522 --> 01:02:23.024
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

01:02:24.609 --> 01:02:29.197
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

01:02:29.406 --> 01:02:31.491
Sugar!

01:02:31.574 --> 01:02:33.034
Time to change for dinner.

01:02:33.159 --> 01:02:36.496
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.634
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?

01:02:49.926 --> 01:02:51.594
Happens to me all the time.

01:02:51.803 --> 01:02:55.056
l recognised him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.601
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

01:02:58.685 --> 01:03:01.312
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

01:03:01.396 --> 01:03:03.273
His yacht?

01:03:03.481 --> 01:03:06.943
lt sleeps 1 2. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:08.695
I'm a what?

01:03:08.903 --> 01:03:10.905
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

01:03:12.032 --> 01:03:15.910
l heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:17.787
She squealed on her roommate

01:03:17.996 --> 01:03:21.124
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

01:03:21.207 --> 01:03:26.338
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

01:03:26.421 --> 01:03:28.423
Well, l think I'd better be going.

01:03:28.631 --> 01:03:30.717
lt was delightful meeting you both.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.928
- You will come and hear us play?
- lf it's at all possible.

01:03:34.054 --> 01:03:36.348
Do come. lt'll be such fun.

01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:39.476
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

01:03:45.523 --> 01:03:49.819
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. l saw him first.

01:03:50.028 --> 01:03:54.824
Sugar, a little advice. lf l were a girl,
and l am, I'd watch my step.

01:03:55.033 --> 01:03:57.869
lf I'd been watching my step,
l never would have met him.

01:03:57.952 --> 01:04:01.831
- l can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

01:04:01.915 --> 01:04:04.626
l can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:07.337
Neither can l.
Let's go tell her right now.

01:04:07.545 --> 01:04:09.964
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

01:04:18.515 --> 01:04:20.475
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

01:04:21.518 --> 01:04:24.229
- l guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

01:04:24.354 --> 01:04:26.314
l can't imagine where she'd be.

01:04:26.523 --> 01:04:28.525
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

01:04:28.608 --> 01:04:30.819
l have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

01:04:30.902 --> 01:04:35.198
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:38.326
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:43.123
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

01:04:56.344 --> 01:04:59.681
- Josephine.
- Oh. l didn't hear you come in.

01:05:06.563 --> 01:05:11.276
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

01:05:11.484 --> 01:05:13.028
- What?
- Guess.

01:05:13.236 --> 01:05:17.407
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

01:05:18.033 --> 01:05:20.452
- l met one of them.
- One of whom?

01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:24.497
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
glasses and a yacht.

01:05:24.706 --> 01:05:26.082
You don't say.

01:05:26.166 --> 01:05:28.043
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

01:05:28.251 --> 01:05:30.253
Daphne.

01:05:30.337 --> 01:05:32.422
Go on. Tell me all about him.

01:05:32.547 --> 01:05:35.675
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

01:05:35.884 --> 01:05:40.472
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

01:05:40.555 --> 01:05:42.974
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

01:05:43.183 --> 01:05:47.228
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

01:05:47.437 --> 01:05:49.856
Shells? Whatever for?

01:05:49.939 --> 01:05:53.193
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

01:05:53.276 --> 01:05:54.944
Daphne, you're bothering us.

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:57.781
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- l am?

01:05:57.864 --> 01:06:00.075
He said he'd come
to hear us play - maybe.

01:06:00.283 --> 01:06:04.746
What do you mean, maybe? l saw the way
he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.

01:06:04.954 --> 01:06:06.331
l hope so.

01:06:06.539 --> 01:06:10.085
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

01:06:10.794 --> 01:06:13.838
Sugar. ls Sugar in here?

01:06:13.922 --> 01:06:18.093
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

01:06:18.218 --> 01:06:20.720
See you on the bandstand, girls.

01:06:24.474 --> 01:06:28.103
What are you tryin' to do to that girl,
puttin' on a millionaire act?

01:06:28.311 --> 01:06:32.399
And that phoney accent?
Nobody talks like that.

01:06:32.482 --> 01:06:34.693
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

01:06:34.776 --> 01:06:38.655
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

01:06:44.703 --> 01:06:46.996
I'm not afraid of you.

01:06:48.748 --> 01:06:50.625
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:54.796
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

01:06:55.005 --> 01:06:59.718
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
lt was all a joke. l didn't mean any harm.

01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:02.971
I'm gonna press
the suit myself. Telephone.

01:07:03.179 --> 01:07:05.473
Answer the tele...phone.

01:07:09.853 --> 01:07:11.438
Hello?

01:07:12.689 --> 01:07:14.858
Yes, this is 41 3.

01:07:15.066 --> 01:07:18.528
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:21.322
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

01:07:21.448 --> 01:07:23.742
You know - Osgood? ln the elevator?

01:07:23.825 --> 01:07:26.536
You slapped my face?

01:07:27.787 --> 01:07:30.498
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

01:07:30.707 --> 01:07:32.917
Daphne can't talk right now. ls it urgent?

01:07:33.001 --> 01:07:35.628
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

01:07:35.712 --> 01:07:40.091
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.428
Got it. Supper, yacht,
after the show. I'll tell her.

01:07:43.553 --> 01:07:47.182
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

01:07:47.307 --> 01:07:51.895
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:57.192
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

01:07:58.651 --> 01:08:02.322
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?

01:08:02.405 --> 01:08:06.493
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

01:08:06.701 --> 01:08:09.079
We'll have cold pheasant
with champagne.

01:08:09.287 --> 01:08:13.875
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

01:08:14.084 --> 01:08:18.380
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

01:08:19.714 --> 01:08:23.385
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

01:08:23.468 --> 01:08:25.970
Pushover for who? What...

01:08:26.095 --> 01:08:28.180
Yes, Mr Fielding.

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:32.143
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

01:08:32.227 --> 01:08:34.104
What's that you said?

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:38.817
- ''Zowie.'' I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:43.071
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:46.950
Just the three of you on that
great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:49.452
Fat chance. Call him back
and say I'm not goin'.

01:08:49.661 --> 01:08:51.328
Of course you're not.

01:08:51.412 --> 01:08:53.415
I'm going.

01:08:54.124 --> 01:08:57.042
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:59.337
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

01:08:59.546 --> 01:09:02.381
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

01:09:02.465 --> 01:09:04.134
- With me?
- That's right.

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:07.178
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

01:10:23.129 --> 01:10:26.257
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

01:10:26.466 --> 01:10:28.426
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

01:10:28.635 --> 01:10:31.680
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

01:10:33.223 --> 01:10:37.727
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

01:10:47.612 --> 01:10:50.240
Why do l let you talk me
into these things? Why?

01:10:50.448 --> 01:10:53.159
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

01:10:53.243 --> 01:10:57.122
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am l gonna keep him ashore?

01:10:57.205 --> 01:11:00.125
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:04.629
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.720
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?

01:11:11.803 --> 01:11:13.471
Bull fiddle.

01:11:13.596 --> 01:11:15.890
From satchel mouth at table seven.

01:11:20.979 --> 01:11:24.649
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

01:11:24.858 --> 01:11:28.403
Never mind leaving your door open.
l got a passkey.

01:11:34.117 --> 01:11:38.204
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.

01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:11.154
l guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.

01:12:11.237 --> 01:12:14.991
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.993
These came for you.

01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:18.953
For me?

01:12:20.622 --> 01:12:21.998
It's Shell Oil.

01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:24.292
- No!
- Yes!

01:12:24.376 --> 01:12:26.586
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

01:12:26.795 --> 01:12:28.463
He's picking me up at the pier.

01:12:28.672 --> 01:12:30.006
- No!
- Yes.

01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:32.008
You heard her - yes.

01:12:32.092 --> 01:12:36.596
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

01:12:36.805 --> 01:12:38.556
on a millionaire's yacht.

01:12:38.765 --> 01:12:41.393
lf my mother could only see me now.

01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:46.064
l hope my mother never finds out.

01:12:47.524 --> 01:12:50.860
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

01:12:50.985 --> 01:12:56.408
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

01:12:56.616 --> 01:12:59.202
And l intend to keep it that way.

01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:07.544
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:14:37.592 --> 01:14:40.512
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

01:14:40.595 --> 01:14:43.014
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

01:14:43.098 --> 01:14:45.517
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

01:14:49.771 --> 01:14:52.816
Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.

01:14:52.899 --> 01:14:54.901
Who?

01:14:54.984 --> 01:14:56.986
About the roadhouse?

01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:59.364
They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

01:14:59.489 --> 01:15:03.535
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.745
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?

01:15:05.829 --> 01:15:07.831
You're dynamite.

01:15:08.039 --> 01:15:10.834
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:05.597
Ahoy, there.

01:16:06.723 --> 01:16:08.933
Ahoy.

01:16:17.067 --> 01:16:19.569
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

01:16:19.652 --> 01:16:23.615
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:28.536
l wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long lsland is fogged in.

01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:30.705
It's the thought that counts.

01:16:37.921 --> 01:16:39.881
l seem to be out of gas.

01:16:40.006 --> 01:16:43.968
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
l mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.

01:16:44.177 --> 01:16:46.262
Oops. There.

01:16:51.267 --> 01:16:53.478
lt seems to be stuck in reverse.

01:16:54.938 --> 01:16:58.483
l just got this motorboat.
It's an an experimental model.

01:16:58.608 --> 01:17:00.777
lt seems like they're on the wrong track.

01:17:00.902 --> 01:17:03.613
Do you mind riding backwards?
lt may take a little longer.

01:17:03.822 --> 01:17:07.158
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

01:17:33.435 --> 01:17:35.520
lt looked so small from the beach.

01:17:35.603 --> 01:17:38.857
But when you're on it, it's like
a cruiser or a destroyer.

01:17:39.065 --> 01:17:43.862
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

01:17:43.945 --> 01:17:47.198
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

01:17:47.282 --> 01:17:51.244
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

01:17:51.453 --> 01:17:53.663
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

01:17:53.747 --> 01:17:56.583
That depends on
whether you're coming or going.

01:17:56.666 --> 01:18:00.754
l mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

01:18:00.837 --> 01:18:05.550
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

01:18:05.633 --> 01:18:09.387
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

01:18:12.223 --> 01:18:16.186
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

01:18:17.937 --> 01:18:22.442
And another nice thing about
this yacht - lots of closet space.

01:18:22.525 --> 01:18:26.905
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

01:18:29.741 --> 01:18:31.701
ln here.

01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:34.746
Of course. How silly of me.

01:18:34.829 --> 01:18:38.500
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

01:18:46.925 --> 01:18:50.053
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

01:18:50.178 --> 01:18:52.263
It's all right for a bachelor.

01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:57.060
- What a beautiful fish.
- l caught him off Cape Hatteras.

01:18:57.977 --> 01:19:00.063
What is it?

01:19:00.188 --> 01:19:03.108
It's a member of the herring family.

01:19:03.817 --> 01:19:05.819
A herring?

01:19:06.027 --> 01:19:10.615
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

01:19:10.824 --> 01:19:12.992
They shrink when they're marinated.

01:19:13.118 --> 01:19:15.203
- Champagne?
- l don't mind if l do.

01:19:15.286 --> 01:19:17.997
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

01:19:18.123 --> 01:19:20.208
Bon voyage.

01:19:24.254 --> 01:19:26.965
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

01:19:27.173 --> 01:19:30.510
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:32.721
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

01:19:32.929 --> 01:19:35.432
I'll say. l had two ponies
drowned under me.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.600
Where's your shell collection?

01:19:37.809 --> 01:19:40.228
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

01:19:40.437 --> 01:19:43.023
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

01:19:43.231 --> 01:19:46.151
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

01:19:46.359 --> 01:19:49.612
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

01:19:49.696 --> 01:19:53.450
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

01:19:53.658 --> 01:19:56.286
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

01:19:56.369 --> 01:19:59.289
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

01:19:59.497 --> 01:20:02.125
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

01:20:02.834 --> 01:20:04.210
It's not the icebergs.

01:20:04.294 --> 01:20:07.630
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

01:20:07.797 --> 01:20:11.634
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

01:20:12.594 --> 01:20:16.348
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:19.142
- Harmless? How?
- l don't know how to put it,

01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:21.561
but I've got this thing about girls.

01:20:21.644 --> 01:20:25.190
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

01:20:25.398 --> 01:20:27.192
You mean, like, frigid?

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.778
Well, it's more like a mental block.

01:20:29.986 --> 01:20:33.448
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

01:20:33.531 --> 01:20:38.036
- Have you tried?
- Have l. I'm trying all the time.

01:20:44.584 --> 01:20:47.504
See? Nothing.

01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:50.215
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.551
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.680
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

01:20:56.805 --> 01:20:58.890
Something goes wrong inside.

01:20:58.973 --> 01:21:02.018
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not any more.

01:21:02.227 --> 01:21:04.938
l was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

01:21:05.146 --> 01:21:08.066
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

01:21:08.274 --> 01:21:11.486
- l don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

01:21:11.695 --> 01:21:13.697
Well...

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:15.990
lt was my freshman year at Princeton.

01:21:16.199 --> 01:21:18.493
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

01:21:18.576 --> 01:21:21.287
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

01:21:21.496 --> 01:21:23.915
She wore glasses, too.

01:21:24.124 --> 01:21:26.626
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

01:21:26.710 --> 01:21:29.629
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:32.257
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:35.802
l took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

01:21:35.885 --> 01:21:37.971
l took a step toward her.

01:21:38.179 --> 01:21:41.099
She took a step toward me.

01:21:41.725 --> 01:21:45.603
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

01:21:45.687 --> 01:21:49.774
l gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.

01:21:49.858 --> 01:21:52.777
But it was too late.

01:21:52.902 --> 01:21:54.779
Talk about sad.

01:21:54.863 --> 01:21:56.948
Ever since then,

01:21:57.073 --> 01:22:00.618
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

01:22:00.827 --> 01:22:03.121
You poor, poor boy.

01:22:03.204 --> 01:22:06.124
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

01:22:06.249 --> 01:22:08.126
Mint sauce or cranberries?

01:22:08.835 --> 01:22:11.963
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

01:22:12.088 --> 01:22:14.174
What else is there for me?

01:22:14.257 --> 01:22:17.927
- ls it that hopeless?
- My family did everyzhing they could.

01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:20.722
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:24.059
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

01:22:24.184 --> 01:22:26.353
lmported a troupe of Balinese dancers

01:22:26.561 --> 01:22:29.814
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

01:22:30.023 --> 01:22:32.317
What a waste of money.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.819
Have you ever tried American girls?

01:22:34.903 --> 01:22:36.696
Why?

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:44.496
Was that anyzhing?

01:22:45.538 --> 01:22:47.624
Thanks just the same.

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:50.669
You should see a doctor - a good doctor.

01:22:50.752 --> 01:22:55.465
l have. l spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

01:22:56.591 --> 01:23:01.304
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

01:23:01.388 --> 01:23:03.890
lf l wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:07.352
Don't say that.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.271
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

01:23:10.355 --> 01:23:14.651
lf l ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

01:23:15.568 --> 01:23:18.488
- Would you do me a favour?
- Certainly. What is it?

01:23:18.613 --> 01:23:22.575
l may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

01:23:22.701 --> 01:23:25.412
but could l take another crack at it?

01:23:26.246 --> 01:23:28.748
All right, if you insist.

01:23:41.678 --> 01:23:45.849
- Anyzhing this time?
- I'm afraid not.

01:23:46.057 --> 01:23:49.394
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

01:23:51.896 --> 01:23:55.650
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

01:23:56.818 --> 01:24:00.447
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

01:24:00.655 --> 01:24:02.866
l think the light switch is over there.

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.665
That's the radio.

01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:14.336
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

01:24:50.497 --> 01:24:53.124
You're not giving yourself a chance.

01:24:53.208 --> 01:24:56.044
Don't fight it.

01:24:56.544 --> 01:24:58.630
Relax.

01:25:11.976 --> 01:25:14.187
It's like smoking without inhaling.

01:25:14.396 --> 01:25:16.356
So inhale.

01:25:39.504 --> 01:25:40.880
Daphne,

01:25:40.964 --> 01:25:43.383
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.

01:25:57.647 --> 01:25:59.232
Well?

01:26:00.775 --> 01:26:02.861
I'm not quite sure.

01:26:02.986 --> 01:26:05.363
Would you try it again?

01:26:15.582 --> 01:26:18.835
l got a funny sensation in my toes.

01:26:19.753 --> 01:26:22.881
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

01:26:24.341 --> 01:26:27.052
Let's throw another log on the fire.

01:26:36.644 --> 01:26:39.314
l think you're on the right track.

01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:43.568
l must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

01:27:08.301 --> 01:27:10.804
l never knew it could be like this.

01:27:12.263 --> 01:27:14.224
Thank you.

01:27:14.432 --> 01:27:17.560
They told me l was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

01:27:17.686 --> 01:27:21.439
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

01:27:24.025 --> 01:27:26.444
Mineral baths. Now, really.

01:27:26.528 --> 01:27:29.989
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

01:27:30.073 --> 01:27:33.410
l used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

01:27:43.211 --> 01:27:48.216
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:54.949
Whoops.

01:29:22.811 --> 01:29:25.814
- Good night.
- Good morning.

01:29:25.939 --> 01:29:28.024
How much do l owe the Milk Fund so far?

01:29:28.233 --> 01:29:30.735
$850,000.

01:29:30.944 --> 01:29:33.530
Let's make it an even million.

01:29:54.175 --> 01:29:56.928
l forgot to give you a receipt.

01:30:38.219 --> 01:30:40.513
Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?

01:30:40.638 --> 01:30:43.350
Have l got things to tell you.

01:30:43.433 --> 01:30:46.895
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

01:30:46.978 --> 01:30:50.440
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

01:30:50.523 --> 01:30:52.192
l am.

01:30:56.488 --> 01:30:58.239
What?

01:30:58.365 --> 01:31:01.701
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

01:31:04.204 --> 01:31:07.207
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

01:31:08.375 --> 01:31:12.128
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

01:31:12.212 --> 01:31:14.923
Why not? He keeps
marryin' girls all the time.

01:31:16.383 --> 01:31:18.593
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.

01:31:18.677 --> 01:31:20.679
And why would a guy
wanna marry a guy?

01:31:20.887 --> 01:31:22.764
Security.

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:27.352
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.

01:31:27.435 --> 01:31:30.689
- I'm not stupid. l know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

01:31:30.897 --> 01:31:35.485
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because l don't smoke.

01:31:38.405 --> 01:31:41.950
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

01:31:42.033 --> 01:31:45.995
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

01:31:46.204 --> 01:31:50.291
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but l kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.173
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this.

01:31:57.382 --> 01:32:01.219
l don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

01:32:01.344 --> 01:32:04.055
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

01:32:04.264 --> 01:32:07.600
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

01:32:07.809 --> 01:32:10.937
and l keep gettin' those
alimony cheques every month.

01:32:15.316 --> 01:32:17.402
Jerry, listen to me.

01:32:17.485 --> 01:32:20.822
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

01:32:21.573 --> 01:32:24.701
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

01:32:24.784 --> 01:32:28.872
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

01:32:28.955 --> 01:32:32.834
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

01:32:32.917 --> 01:32:36.171
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

01:32:36.254 --> 01:32:39.716
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

01:32:39.924 --> 01:32:43.678
l wish l were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am l a boy.

01:32:43.762 --> 01:32:46.181
What about my engagement present?

01:32:46.264 --> 01:32:49.726
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

01:32:51.478 --> 01:32:53.146
Hey, these are real diamonds.

01:32:53.271 --> 01:32:55.982
Of course they're real.
You think my fiancé is a bum?

01:32:56.066 --> 01:33:00.653
- l guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

01:33:00.779 --> 01:33:04.324
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

01:33:07.327 --> 01:33:09.954
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

01:33:17.379 --> 01:33:18.213
Come in.

01:33:19.464 --> 01:33:24.052
l thought l heard voices. l had to talk to
somebody. l don't feel like going to sleep.

01:33:24.177 --> 01:33:28.014
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

01:33:28.765 --> 01:33:32.310
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

01:33:32.394 --> 01:33:35.522
lt was suicidally beautiful.

01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:36.898
Did he get fresh?

01:33:36.981 --> 01:33:40.443
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

01:33:40.652 --> 01:33:42.821
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

01:33:43.029 --> 01:33:45.740
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

01:33:45.865 --> 01:33:49.411
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

01:33:49.911 --> 01:33:52.205
Gee, l wish I'd been there.

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:54.708
I'm going to see him again
tonight - and every night.

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:56.710
l think he's going to propose.

01:33:56.793 --> 01:33:59.629
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

01:33:59.713 --> 01:34:01.923
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

01:34:02.841 --> 01:34:05.135
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

01:34:05.343 --> 01:34:07.137
That's wonderful.

01:34:07.345 --> 01:34:09.514
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

01:34:09.639 --> 01:34:11.391
Well, Daphne has a beau, l have a beau...

01:34:11.599 --> 01:34:14.227
lf we could only find somebody for you.

01:34:16.604 --> 01:34:18.606
Here l am, doll.

01:34:44.966 --> 01:34:48.303
''Friends of ltalian Opera'' - that's us.

01:34:48.428 --> 01:34:50.722
Register over there.

01:34:59.481 --> 01:35:03.026
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

01:35:04.069 --> 01:35:06.154
Thanks.

01:35:06.237 --> 01:35:07.822
Hiya, Spats.

01:35:07.906 --> 01:35:11.034
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't l?

01:35:11.159 --> 01:35:14.287
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

01:35:14.496 --> 01:35:18.750
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:21.252
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.

01:35:21.378 --> 01:35:25.131
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

01:35:29.719 --> 01:35:32.639
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

01:35:32.847 --> 01:35:35.767
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

01:35:35.850 --> 01:35:38.061
All right, you're clean.

01:35:38.269 --> 01:35:40.355
You're not.

01:35:50.448 --> 01:35:52.951
lt ain't loaded.

01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:03.795
Next. What's in here?

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.340
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

01:36:08.383 --> 01:36:10.802
- What's this?
- My mashie.

01:36:15.807 --> 01:36:18.309
See you at the banquet, Spats.

01:36:19.227 --> 01:36:22.480
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

01:36:22.689 --> 01:36:25.066
Come on, boys.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.153
Well. Spats Colombo, if l ever saw one.

01:36:28.194 --> 01:36:30.530
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

01:36:30.739 --> 01:36:32.741
l heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.

01:36:32.949 --> 01:36:35.869
Thought I'd come in case
anybody decided to sing.

01:36:35.952 --> 01:36:37.203
Big joke.

01:36:37.328 --> 01:36:39.706
Where were you at 3pm
on St Valentine's Day?

01:36:39.831 --> 01:36:42.834
- l was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

01:36:43.043 --> 01:36:45.045
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

01:36:45.128 --> 01:36:48.465
- ln the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:52.135
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

01:36:52.218 --> 01:36:55.472
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

01:36:55.555 --> 01:36:57.349
l cut myself while shaving.

01:36:57.557 --> 01:37:00.268
- You shave with spats on?
- l sleep with my spats on.

01:37:00.352 --> 01:37:03.813
Stop kidding. You vulcanised
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

01:37:03.897 --> 01:37:05.148
You and who else?

01:37:05.357 --> 01:37:09.235
Me and those two witnesses you
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

01:37:09.444 --> 01:37:12.238
Boys, know anyzhing about
any garage or witnesses?

01:37:12.364 --> 01:37:15.075
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

01:37:15.158 --> 01:37:17.452
Honest.

01:37:18.912 --> 01:37:23.208
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

01:37:23.416 --> 01:37:25.794
That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.

01:37:35.512 --> 01:37:39.891
l feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery
from a man under false pretences.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:43.728
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

01:37:43.853 --> 01:37:46.439
lt'll break his heart when
he finds out l can't marry him.

01:37:46.648 --> 01:37:49.901
lt'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

01:37:49.984 --> 01:37:52.487
Can't make an omelette
without breakin' an egg.

01:37:52.612 --> 01:37:54.906
- What's with the omelette?
- Nag, nag, nag.

01:37:54.989 --> 01:37:59.786
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.

01:38:03.748 --> 01:38:05.834
- Joe!
- What?

01:38:07.293 --> 01:38:10.964
Something tells me the omelette
is about to hit the fan.

01:38:13.133 --> 01:38:15.218
Come on, Daphne.

01:38:19.514 --> 01:38:21.474
- Going up.
- Hold it.

01:38:29.524 --> 01:38:31.401
Three, please.

01:38:42.662 --> 01:38:44.330
l don't mean to be forward,

01:38:44.414 --> 01:38:47.542
but ain't l had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:50.253
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

01:38:50.462 --> 01:38:53.715
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

01:38:53.798 --> 01:38:56.217
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

01:38:56.426 --> 01:38:57.677
Third floor.

01:38:57.761 --> 01:39:00.889
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

01:39:02.057 --> 01:39:04.017
Room 41 3. We'll be in touch.

01:39:04.225 --> 01:39:06.936
Don't call us. We'll call you.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.242
l tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:24.788
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:28.124
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

01:39:28.208 --> 01:39:30.418
and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.

01:39:30.627 --> 01:39:33.630
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

01:39:33.755 --> 01:39:35.924
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

01:39:36.049 --> 01:39:38.218
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:45.016
l tell you, l will never find
another man who's so good to me.

01:39:45.266 --> 01:39:49.854
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

01:39:49.938 --> 01:39:53.066
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

01:39:53.274 --> 01:39:57.153
l figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

01:39:57.237 --> 01:39:59.114
lf we get outta the hotel alive.

01:39:59.239 --> 01:40:02.158
- Did we forget anyzhing?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

01:40:02.242 --> 01:40:04.536
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

01:40:04.744 --> 01:40:06.746
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:09.249
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

01:40:09.332 --> 01:40:11.543
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

01:40:11.751 --> 01:40:14.671
You usually walk out and leave 'em
with a kick in the teeth.

01:40:14.754 --> 01:40:18.216
That's when l was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

01:40:18.299 --> 01:40:21.761
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

01:40:21.845 --> 01:40:24.556
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

01:40:24.764 --> 01:40:26.349
Ship to shore?

01:40:26.433 --> 01:40:28.852
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

01:40:33.857 --> 01:40:37.819
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

01:40:37.902 --> 01:40:40.321
l may throw up.

01:40:41.865 --> 01:40:45.827
No, l didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, l never closed an eye.

01:40:46.036 --> 01:40:49.789
l never slept better.
l had the most wonderful dream.

01:40:49.998 --> 01:40:52.292
l was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

01:40:52.417 --> 01:40:55.128
We drifted for days and days.

01:40:55.337 --> 01:40:57.088
You were the captain and l was the crew.

01:40:57.213 --> 01:41:02.093
l kept a lookout for icebergs, l sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

01:41:02.218 --> 01:41:05.013
and l wiped the steam off your glasses.

01:41:05.138 --> 01:41:09.100
And when l woke up, l wanted
to swim right back to you.

01:41:09.934 --> 01:41:11.811
Yes...

01:41:11.895 --> 01:41:14.189
Now, about our date for tonight...

01:41:14.397 --> 01:41:17.233
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.404
I'm afraid not. l can't make it tonight.

01:41:23.156 --> 01:41:25.784
Not tomorrow either. l have to leave.

01:41:25.867 --> 01:41:29.621
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

01:41:29.829 --> 01:41:31.915
Where to?

01:41:32.123 --> 01:41:34.751
South America?

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.545
That is unexpected.

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.216
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

01:41:41.299 --> 01:41:45.387
l just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

01:41:45.595 --> 01:41:48.515
A merger? How long will you be gone?

01:41:50.684 --> 01:41:52.560
Quite a while.

01:41:52.769 --> 01:41:55.689
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

01:41:55.814 --> 01:41:57.899
You're not?

01:41:58.316 --> 01:42:01.653
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

01:42:01.736 --> 01:42:06.533
lt just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

01:42:06.658 --> 01:42:09.994
Oh. That kind of merger.

01:42:10.078 --> 01:42:12.080
What is she like?

01:42:12.163 --> 01:42:14.874
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

01:42:15.083 --> 01:42:16.876
But that's the way the oil gushes.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.630
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

01:42:20.839 --> 01:42:24.384
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

01:42:24.467 --> 01:42:28.346
Of course. l understand.
At least, l think l do.

01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:34.394
l knew you would. l only wish there
was something l could do for you.

01:42:34.477 --> 01:42:38.023
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:40.108
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

01:42:40.233 --> 01:42:43.445
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

01:42:43.653 --> 01:42:45.655
Smart move.

01:42:45.864 --> 01:42:48.783
By the way, did you get my flowers?

01:42:48.867 --> 01:42:51.286
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

01:42:51.494 --> 01:42:55.665
The fog finally lifted over Long lsland
and they flew them down this morning.

01:42:55.749 --> 01:42:59.502
That's strange. l sent 'em to your room.

01:43:01.338 --> 01:43:03.631
They should have been delivered by now.

01:43:07.385 --> 01:43:10.930
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

01:43:16.853 --> 01:43:19.689
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

01:43:19.773 --> 01:43:22.817
l haven't had white orchids
since l was a debutante.

01:43:24.778 --> 01:43:26.780
What's this?

01:43:27.906 --> 01:43:29.366
What's what?

01:43:29.574 --> 01:43:32.202
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

01:43:33.036 --> 01:43:35.955
Real diamonds.

01:43:36.039 --> 01:43:40.543
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

01:43:42.003 --> 01:43:43.463
Not always.

01:43:43.672 --> 01:43:46.591
l wanted you to know how grateful
l am for what you did for me.

01:43:46.675 --> 01:43:50.011
l didn't do anyzhing. lt just happened.

01:43:52.722 --> 01:43:55.558
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

01:43:55.767 --> 01:43:59.104
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

01:43:59.187 --> 01:44:01.606
lf you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

01:44:01.815 --> 01:44:03.775
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:06.403
Goodbye, my darling.

01:44:06.486 --> 01:44:09.948
l don't know about the captain but
the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

01:44:10.031 --> 01:44:13.284
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

01:44:15.787 --> 01:44:17.539
What happened to my bracelet?

01:44:17.664 --> 01:44:21.710
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?

01:44:21.918 --> 01:44:26.214
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.

01:44:26.297 --> 01:44:28.717
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.428
It's on the level this time.

01:44:37.475 --> 01:44:39.561
Where's that bourbon?

01:44:45.692 --> 01:44:50.280
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- l don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

01:44:51.448 --> 01:44:53.324
How did you get that bracelet?

01:44:53.408 --> 01:44:55.285
- You like it?
- l always did.

01:44:55.493 --> 01:45:00.290
Junior gave it to me. He's gone
to South America to marry another girl.

01:45:00.415 --> 01:45:03.543
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what l call a louse.

01:45:03.752 --> 01:45:07.297
lf l were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:12.177
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.

01:45:12.302 --> 01:45:14.804
You'll forget him, Sugar.

01:45:15.638 --> 01:45:20.643
How can l? No matter where l go, there'll
always be a Shell station on every corner.

01:45:20.727 --> 01:45:24.064
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:29.486
Are you crazy? The place
is crawlin' with mobsters.

01:45:29.694 --> 01:45:32.822
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.

01:45:33.031 --> 01:45:35.116
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:39.287
- We'll walk. lf we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that ''we'' again.

01:45:39.412 --> 01:45:42.749
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.677
Your hands clean?

01:45:53.802 --> 01:45:55.261
Over.

01:45:55.345 --> 01:45:57.347
OK, button my spats.

01:46:00.266 --> 01:46:02.352
You sure dress nice, boss.

01:46:02.435 --> 01:46:05.563
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:10.068
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

01:46:10.151 --> 01:46:14.030
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

01:46:14.114 --> 01:46:17.826
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

01:46:18.034 --> 01:46:19.994
Like l was tellin' you fellas.

01:46:20.203 --> 01:46:23.456
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here any more.

01:46:23.665 --> 01:46:25.959
Used to be like a rock.

01:46:26.042 --> 01:46:30.839
- It's too bad. l think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

01:46:30.964 --> 01:46:32.841
How are we gonna retire him?

01:46:32.924 --> 01:46:35.010
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

01:46:35.218 --> 01:46:39.305
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singin' in the same choir again.

01:46:42.517 --> 01:46:46.062
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

01:46:48.565 --> 01:46:52.444
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:57.657
Hey. Join us.

01:46:58.283 --> 01:47:01.202
What's the matter with those dames?

01:47:01.286 --> 01:47:03.580
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

01:47:06.291 --> 01:47:09.002
Same faces, same instruments.

01:47:12.756 --> 01:47:16.301
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

01:47:16.426 --> 01:47:21.306
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

01:47:39.783 --> 01:47:44.371
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

01:49:23.219 --> 01:49:24.262
What happened?

01:49:24.471 --> 01:49:27.807
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

01:49:28.016 --> 01:49:31.227
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

01:49:31.353 --> 01:49:35.023
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.

01:49:35.148 --> 01:49:37.650
They can't be too far away.

01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:58.797
Thank you.

01:49:58.922 --> 01:50:01.216
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:06.638
It's been ten years since l elected myself
president of this organisation,

01:50:06.721 --> 01:50:10.809
and, if l say so myself,
you made the right choice.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.314
Let's look at the record.
ln the last fiscal year,

01:50:16.439 --> 01:50:20.610
we made $1 1 2 million before taxes.

01:50:20.694 --> 01:50:23.738
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

01:50:24.864 --> 01:50:29.244
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:33.331
Let us now observe one minute of silence

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:37.919
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

01:50:38.003 --> 01:50:42.716
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

01:50:47.178 --> 01:50:49.264
You too, Spats.

01:50:49.472 --> 01:50:51.474
Up.

01:51:01.067 --> 01:51:02.736
Easy, now.

01:51:02.944 --> 01:51:06.156
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

01:51:06.364 --> 01:51:10.452
For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny.

01:51:10.535 --> 01:51:12.537
OK.

01:51:16.499 --> 01:51:20.670
And don't mess up the cake. l promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

01:51:28.178 --> 01:51:30.472
Now, fellow delegates,

01:51:30.555 --> 01:51:34.225
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

01:51:34.309 --> 01:51:37.145
when he starts thinkin' about retirement.

01:51:37.228 --> 01:51:39.230
No!

01:51:41.608 --> 01:51:44.944
I'm lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:48.198
I've been considerin' several candidates.

01:51:48.406 --> 01:51:51.618
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

01:51:51.826 --> 01:51:53.912
South Side Chapter.

01:51:56.206 --> 01:52:01.753
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

01:52:01.836 --> 01:52:05.590
But l say he's a man who'll go far.

01:52:05.715 --> 01:52:09.886
Some people say he's gone too far.

01:52:09.969 --> 01:52:13.640
But l say,
you can't keep a good man down.

01:52:14.766 --> 01:52:16.976
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:19.688
The big noise he made
on St Valentine's Day,

01:52:19.771 --> 01:52:23.108
that wasn't very good for public relations.

01:52:23.233 --> 01:52:29.072
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

01:52:29.155 --> 01:52:32.200
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

01:52:32.283 --> 01:52:34.494
l almost caught up with them today.

01:52:34.577 --> 01:52:38.665
You mean you let 'em get away twice?

01:52:38.748 --> 01:52:42.002
Some people would say
that's real sloppy.

01:52:42.085 --> 01:52:46.256
But l say: to err is human,
to forgive divine.

01:52:46.464 --> 01:52:48.758
And just to show you
what l think of you, Spats,

01:52:49.009 --> 01:52:51.428
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

01:52:51.511 --> 01:52:53.596
So we baked you a little cake.

01:52:54.431 --> 01:52:56.307
My birthday?

01:52:56.516 --> 01:52:58.935
Why, it ain't for another four months.

01:52:59.019 --> 01:53:02.897
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

01:53:02.981 --> 01:53:05.400
All right, boys. Now all together.

01:53:05.608 --> 01:53:07.902
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:53:08.194 --> 01:53:10.405
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:53:10.613 --> 01:53:14.367
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:53:14.451 --> 01:53:16.953
Which nobody can deny.

01:53:17.162 --> 01:53:19.039
Which nobody can deny.

01:53:19.247 --> 01:53:21.875
Which nobody can deny.

01:53:22.083 --> 01:53:24.461
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:53:24.586 --> 01:53:26.671
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:30.091
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:53:30.717 --> 01:53:33.845
Which nobody can deny.

01:53:49.194 --> 01:53:51.279
Big joke.

01:53:58.244 --> 01:54:00.246
Let's get outta here.

01:54:03.166 --> 01:54:05.669
Get those two guys.

01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:14.302
What happened here?

01:54:14.427 --> 01:54:18.682
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

01:54:19.933 --> 01:54:24.312
My compliments to the chef. Nobody
leaves this room till l get the recipe.

01:54:24.521 --> 01:54:27.023
You wanna make a federal case of it?

01:54:31.528 --> 01:54:33.405
Yeah.

01:55:00.724 --> 01:55:02.600
They slipped through our hands.

01:55:02.684 --> 01:55:06.771
We're watchin' the train station, roads
and airport. They can't get away.

01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:09.899
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

01:55:09.983 --> 01:55:13.028
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll l tell him?

01:55:13.111 --> 01:55:15.822
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

01:55:15.947 --> 01:55:18.450
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

01:55:18.533 --> 01:55:22.412
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

01:57:24.659 --> 01:57:26.202
Josephine.

01:57:27.662 --> 01:57:30.373
Bienstock!

01:57:31.332 --> 01:57:33.293
Hey. That's no dame.

01:57:33.835 --> 01:57:36.004
None of that, Sugar.

01:57:36.129 --> 01:57:38.214
No guy is worth it.

01:57:41.426 --> 01:57:43.428
Grab her.

01:57:47.182 --> 01:57:49.142
Josephine?

01:57:54.481 --> 01:57:58.026
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

01:58:48.785 --> 01:58:50.161
Hi.

01:58:50.245 --> 01:58:52.872
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

01:58:52.956 --> 01:58:55.041
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

01:58:55.166 --> 01:58:57.043
She's so eager.

01:59:11.099 --> 01:59:13.101
Wait for Sugar!

01:59:18.523 --> 01:59:20.859
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

01:59:21.026 --> 01:59:24.279
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- l told you, I'm not very bright.

01:59:24.404 --> 01:59:26.489
Let's go.

01:59:29.492 --> 01:59:31.077
You don't want me, Sugar.

01:59:31.286 --> 01:59:33.788
I'm a liar and a phoney.
A saxophone player.

01:59:33.872 --> 01:59:36.291
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

01:59:36.374 --> 01:59:37.834
l know. Every time.

01:59:38.043 --> 01:59:41.087
Sugar, do yourself a favour.
Go back to the millionaires.

01:59:41.296 --> 01:59:42.839
The sweet end of the lollipop,

01:59:42.964 --> 01:59:46.926
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

01:59:47.010 --> 01:59:50.138
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.

01:59:54.726 --> 01:59:57.145
l called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

01:59:57.354 --> 02:00:00.357
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

02:00:00.565 --> 02:00:03.610
Osgood, l can't get married
in your mother's dress.

02:00:04.861 --> 02:00:08.198
She and l, we are not built the same way.

02:00:08.406 --> 02:00:10.992
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

02:00:12.035 --> 02:00:15.497
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

02:00:15.705 --> 02:00:17.040
Why not?

02:00:17.248 --> 02:00:18.625
Well...

02:00:18.833 --> 02:00:21.336
ln the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.

02:00:21.419 --> 02:00:23.088
Doesn't matter.

02:00:23.213 --> 02:00:25.590
l smoke. l smoke all the time.

02:00:25.799 --> 02:00:27.384
l don't care.

02:00:27.467 --> 02:00:31.763
l have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

02:00:31.846 --> 02:00:33.848
l forgive you.

02:00:35.392 --> 02:00:38.228
l can never have children.

02:00:38.311 --> 02:00:41.773
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

02:00:43.858 --> 02:00:46.027
- I'm a man.
- Well,

02:00:46.236 --> 02:00:48.655
nobody's perfect.
