-[Breathing heavily]
- You all right?

00:16.440 --> 00:17.794
This isn't the way
back to Hilltop...

00:17.880 --> 00:19.678
Tara made a deal with those assholes.
We broke it.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.354
We ain't going back to Hilltop.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.477
He's right. There's too many of them.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.074
Alpha would destroy Hilltop
to get me back now.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.993
And why didn't you tell us
there was that many of them?

00:30.080 --> 00:31.753
You kept me locked in a cage.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.035
What did you expect?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.111
I wasn't going to betray my own people!

00:35.200 --> 00:37.476
Well, maybe you should go back to 'em.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.313
Henry didn't know what
he was getting his ass into,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.152
but you sure as hell did.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.914
I thought I could go back.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.798
[Breathing heavily]

00:46.880 --> 00:48.439
I can't.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.831
Well, you ain't coming with us.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.839
Hey. Hey, we could run.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.639
Me and her.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.518
You guys go back,
and-- and we keep running.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.398
They can't blame Hilltop
if we just disappear.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.233
Henry, we can't.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.914
Let me fix this.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.509
No.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.830
There's no way in hell

01:14.920 --> 01:16.991
I'm letting you run away
with this one.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.229
No way.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.312
Think of your mom!

01:23.360 --> 01:25.033
No, she's right. Come on.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.679
We gotta go. Come on.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.796
It's this way.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.359
Yeah, this way.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.360

02:35.360 --> 02:38.796
I'm going to be... one of them.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.396
But you will always be...

02:44.480 --> 02:45.959
one of us.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.954
[Shuddering breaths]

02:52.600 --> 02:55.911
Find his wife.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.836
Tell her the change is coming to him.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.831
Did you find them?

03:10.960 --> 03:16.353
No, but we're on their trail.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.115
Get a fighting unit ready to set out.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.511
Lydia will walk with us again...

03:23.640 --> 03:28.953
or they will all walk with the guardians.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.590

04:34.280 --> 04:36.396
Carol: I'm starting to think

04:36.480 --> 04:38.676
this thing might actually come together.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.194
Was there ever a doubt?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.191
Yeah. I had a couple.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.191
Not me.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.033
This is what we fought so hard for.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.034
The chance to be different people.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.634
Not warriors.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.951
After everything we went through
to get here...

04:57.040 --> 04:59.429
we couldn't possibly give up now.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.160
Looks like Jerry's knocking off early.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.796
What happened to their armor?

05:08.880 --> 05:12.396
[Chuckling] Hey, buddy. Ah.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.630
Are you all right?

05:14.720 --> 05:16.870
I'm good.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.230
For reals.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.554
We need to talk to the King.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.520
We got jumped.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.671
We were clearing walkers off the roads,

05:28.760 --> 05:31.673
and they totally bushwhacked us.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.149
Took all our stuff and gave us this.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.715
Ezekiel: "We are the Highwaymen.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.077

the Kingdom belong to us.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.431

to travel to your fair

[Paper rustles]

05:56.200 --> 05:58.396
It's a list of goods for a ransom.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.949
And a map with instructions for payment.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.270
They must've been watching

06:03.360 --> 06:06.113
and heard me talking about
the fair and...

06:06.200 --> 06:07.918
I'm sorry, boss.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.718
I screwed up.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.029
No, Jerry.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.475
The trade fair is hardly a secret,

06:13.600 --> 06:17.116
and we need it because
we are low on food and supplies.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.510
We couldn't pay these pirates
if we wanted to.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.916
Any idea who they are?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.638
There was a rumor
going around Hilltop

06:24.720 --> 06:28.111
that some renegade Saviors
had taken up around here--

06:28.240 --> 06:30.516
Jed's group, I heard.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.591
We didn't see them out there,

06:32.680 --> 06:34.318
but it could be his people.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.629
No, it wasn't them.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.757
Ezekiel: Saviors don't write letters.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.513
If Jed's group was out there,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.318
something must have happened to them

06:41.400 --> 06:44.597
for these "Highwaymen"
to move in on their territory.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.111
Um, your majesties...

06:49.200 --> 06:50.599
the peeps we invited

06:50.720 --> 06:53.314
are counting on us
to keep the roads safe.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.552
We have to do something.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.075
What Say you, my queen?

06:59.160 --> 07:00.753
Jerry's right.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.309
This fair could be our last chance.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.877

07:36.240 --> 07:38.072
Okay.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.559
We got to get the road cleared

07:39.640 --> 07:40.994
before Alden's convoy meets up with us.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.991
- We'll set up a perimeter.
- Okay.

enough lately.

with this little bundle of joy?

like me and you--

08:07.600 --> 08:08.715

08:36.919 --> 08:38.433
She's with Daryl.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.840
Yeah.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.831

08:41.919 --> 08:43.513
he's with Connie.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.750
Hey. They're gonna catch up
with that kid

08:45.840 --> 08:47.239
and meet us at the fair.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.640
Know what?

08:48.720 --> 08:50.074
They're probably already waiting for us.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.395
C'mon.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.437
You can help haul and chop.

Good idea. Come on.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.274
I don't understand.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.352
They use walkers
to protect themselves, right?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.319
So we go up someplace
the walkers can't go.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.391
We separate the living from the dead.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.118
They travel in a herd, but there's only

09:43.200 --> 09:45.760
like five or six of them
in the middle, right?

09:45.840 --> 09:47.513
Yeah, but if we go up there,

09:47.600 --> 09:49.432
we're trapped.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.874
Alpha's not gonna send an army

09:51.960 --> 09:54.349
'cause she doesn't have to.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.511
She'll send Beta.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.553
before one starts shooting?

10:49.640 --> 10:51.119
Sure.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.511
Just like old times.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.196
They have guns.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.794
This fair was meant to be a symbol.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.793
A hope for a better future.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.153
But it looks like violence is

11:23.240 --> 11:25.595
the only currency of this
future, same as the old one.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.591
Ezekiel, maybe...

11:27.680 --> 11:31.514
Maybe we should try talking to them.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.956
What makes you think
thugs like this would listen?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.872
They took my sword.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.357
They could have killed you--

11:40.440 --> 11:41.794
you and your crew.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.279
But they didn't.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.874
I mean, they sent a letter,
for crying out loud.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.031
A grammatically correct one, too.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.350
That sounds pretty civilized, doesn't it?

11:50.440 --> 11:52.670
With all due respect, Your Highness,

11:52.760 --> 11:54.159
screw their letter.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.709
It was a grammatically correct
death threat, yo.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.269
No, it wasn't.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.398
It just says that visitors to the fair

12:02.480 --> 12:04.278
won't be allowed to pass.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.833
These pirates have their knives
at the Kingdom's throat.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.552
What if you're wrong?

12:13.640 --> 12:14.960
It has risks.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.872
We'll talk to them...

12:16.960 --> 12:21.193
and if I'm wrong
and they don't listen...

12:21.280 --> 12:23.396
Then we'll kill them.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.911
There's only two ways up--
that's good.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.150
I think these barricades

14:07.280 --> 14:09.191
are a little too barricaded.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.956
So, we'll cut open holes
so that they can walk up here.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.753
All right?

14:15.840 --> 14:17.399
Thanks.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.756

16:44.000 --> 16:46.310
So, are we gonna do business or not?

16:55.360 --> 16:58.193
You were supposed to bring me something.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.271
We're not paying your toll.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.957
We came to discuss alternative solutions.

an "alternative solution"?

to use our roads...

38:17.280 --> 38:19.032
We'll get you back on your feet,

38:19.120 --> 38:21.191
and then we'll move on.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.078
All of us.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.713
[Breathes sharply]

38:26.800 --> 38:28.029
No.

38:28.120 --> 38:33.274
No, but-- No, but where are we going?

38:36.600 --> 38:39.035
I heard there's a whole world out there.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.589
Come on.

38:41.680 --> 38:44.069
[Grunting]

39:27.200 --> 39:29.111
[Gasps]

39:29.200 --> 39:32.431
[Groaning]

39:51.240 --> 39:54.471
[Breathing heavily]
