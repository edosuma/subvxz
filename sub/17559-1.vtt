WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:06.798
Hey, Vince,
have you seen my sister?

00:06.881 --> 00:08.425
Yeah, she's in Vic's old office.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.974
What are you doing in here?

00:16.056 --> 00:19.352
- I miss Vic.
- You better get out.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.895
The new boss
is gonna be here any minute.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.648
I hate the new boss.
I want pretty Vic.

00:26.192 --> 00:30.572
Oh, hi, I just wanted..
Ew, you're not the new boss.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.577
Oh, hi, handsome.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.163
Ooh, you like?

00:42.292 --> 00:45.295
Val, why can't you just admit
you're gonna miss Vic too?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.172
Of course I'm gonna miss Vic.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.632
I mean, he was a great boss,
tough, but fair

00:49.716 --> 00:51.968
and we're all..
Oh.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.220
Remember how his little hair
used to stick up?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.266
You know what?
I'm glad he's gone.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.226
Now I can stop worrying
about

01:00.310 --> 01:02.312
"He's the boss,
but am I attracted to him?"

01:02.395 --> 01:04.188
Or, "Should I have a drink
with him or not?"

01:04.272 --> 01:06.232
Or, "If I show up at work
wearing his shirt

01:06.316 --> 01:07.942
will people be suspicious?"

01:09.194 --> 01:13.323
Hey.
Uh, this is my office, right?

01:13.406 --> 01:16.659
Later, pretty boy.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.872
Hi, I'm Lauren.
Welcome aboard.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.292
- Peter, nice to meet you.
- Hmm.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.838
Okay, that's good.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.298
Hi, I'm Holly.

01:30.381 --> 01:33.968
If you need anything,
I'm here 24X7.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.970
- Since when?
- Since now.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.182
- Cute kid.
- Thanks.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.351
Uh, that's my sister.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.603
I got her a job here
part-time.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.980
Go nepotism.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.190
I'm Val Tyler.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.858
- Oh, you're Val.
- Mm-hmm.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.569
Hey, nice to meet you.
Vic told me all about you.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.280
He did?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.533
Sounds like you guys
had a great relationship.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.702
Oh, yeah,
we...great relationship.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.996
Very professional.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.581
Strictly professional.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.709
Uh, so, if you need any help
getting settled in or..

02:06.793 --> 02:08.044
Oh, whoo!

02:09.169 --> 02:10.922

02:55.717 --> 02:57.760
Oh, hey, Holly,
how was school?

02:57.844 --> 03:00.305
- Stupid. How's work?
- Stupid.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.144
- Hey, Lauren?
- Yeah.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.770
Isn't it the rule that
if you finish the pot

03:07.854 --> 03:09.647
you have to make a new one?

03:15.403 --> 03:18.781
Oh, hey, bike messenger.

03:18.865 --> 03:24.203
- I have a name.
- Don't care.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.788
What are you eating?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.832
Chicken,
and you're not getting any.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.125
I don't want any.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.501
Don't you know
you're putting tons

03:30.585 --> 03:32.378
of synthetic hormones
into your body?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.005
You've been doing
the same bit all summer.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.798
You're not getting my chicken.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.300
Oh, I think I will.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.385
Oh, my God, get out of here.
Ooh, hard.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.388
Uh-huh, do you want to feel
the machine?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.599
Oh, my God,
you are so obnoxious.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.434
I'm gonna give you a wing.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.144
I'd rather have a drumstick.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.063
You're not getting a drumstick.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.731
Oh, I think I will.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.192
You are such a nerd!
You can't just expect..

03:54.275 --> 03:56.069
- What's up, guys?
- What's up, guys?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.279
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.282
Hey, Henry, I was just stealing
your girlfriend's chicken.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.328
So, you guys are having
a little picnic, huh?

04:05.411 --> 04:07.455
That's fun.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.916
So, uh, you ready to go out
on our date?

04:09.999 --> 04:11.292
Is it 6:00 already?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.504
Yeah, you probably
lost track of time

04:14.587 --> 04:18.216
what with the, uh, picnic
and everything.

04:18.298 --> 04:19.676
Where you guys going?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.260
Oh, we're just gonna hang out
at Washington Square Park

04:21.344 --> 04:22.762
maybe hit the
Liberty Diner after.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.180
Hey, you want to go?

04:24.263 --> 04:25.848
Yeah, yeah,
I could do that.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.226
I got a couple more deliveries.
I'll meet you guys there.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.814
- Thanks for the wing.
- No prob.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.782
What?
What is the matter with you?

04:42.865 --> 04:44.033
Uh, uh, nothing.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.619
I, I was just, uh,
Vince is coming, huh?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.288
- Yeah, that's okay, right?
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.959
I just, uh, I just thought
it was gonna be you and me.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.252
Gary's coming.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.879
Yeah, you, me, and Gary.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.173
That's kind of the group.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.134
Vince can't be in the group?

05:01.217 --> 05:02.593
Of course he can.

05:02.677 --> 05:07.390
It's just that the three of us
have such a wonderful dynamic

05:07.473 --> 05:08.683
it should be a group decision.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.059
I mean,
it's not fair to Gary if--

05:10.143 --> 05:11.185
It doesn't bother me.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.645
As soon as Jill comes back
from France

05:12.729 --> 05:14.522
I'll be ditching y'all anyway.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.904
So, I got my arms around her

05:21.988 --> 05:24.365
and I'm looking
right into her eyes

05:24.449 --> 05:27.326
and just when
I'm about to go for it

05:27.410 --> 05:30.621
I realize chick's a dude!

05:30.705 --> 05:32.623
Oh!

05:32.707 --> 05:34.667
[laughing]

05:35.835 --> 05:39.130
That, my friend,
is one funny story.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.631
[laughing]

05:40.715 --> 05:43.092
Uh, how about you and I go
get us some drinks, huh?

05:43.176 --> 05:47.013
If I can get up.
I'm laughing so hard.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.640
[laughing]

05:51.392 --> 05:52.769
Yo, what's up, man?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.979
You're all over Vince,
laughing at all his jokes

05:55.063 --> 05:56.481
telling him his hair is cool.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.192
- What's up with that?
- It's all part of my plan.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.360
What, to marry him?

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
To act not jealous.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.615
Holly can't know I'm all
insecure and jealous.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.200
It'll make me look weak.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.577
Jealous? Well, come on, man,
what are you jealous of?

06:12.622 --> 06:16.501
It's just, she's always talking
about him and how funny he is.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.213
You know, he gets to see her
more than I do, and he's a guy.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.465
Well, I'm a guy.
You're not jealous of me.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.635
I'm sorry, I just don't
find you attractive.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.844
What?

06:26.928 --> 06:28.387
Well, you're jealous
and insecure

06:28.471 --> 06:31.015
and I don't like weak men.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.518
Wait, Henry, if, if Vince
really bugs you, man

06:33.601 --> 06:34.811
then you need to talk to her
about it.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.938
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.316
See, I think Holly and I
are pretty tight right now.

06:40.399 --> 06:44.362
I'm just not 100% positive
she thinks so.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.823
I mean, what if she isn't
as sure about us as I am?

06:46.906 --> 06:50.660
A jealous boyfriend isn't gonna
make her any more sure.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.579
Yeah, that's true.

06:53.663 --> 06:59.961
So, I'm sorry for calling you
jealous and insecure.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.005
I'm still not attracted to you.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.850
Vic focused mostly
on print placement

07:13.933 --> 07:15.309
but I think, especially now

07:15.393 --> 07:17.436
we should really move more
into electronic media.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.981
- What do you think?
- What?

07:20.064 --> 07:22.358
Oh, sorry, I wasn't, uh..

07:22.441 --> 07:24.527
Can we talk about fun stuff?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.363
Okay.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.990
Oh, is this your family?

07:29.073 --> 07:31.033
Yeah, yeah,
that's my mom and dad

07:31.117 --> 07:32.869
and, uh, my two younger sisters.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.830
And right here, that is the
greatest guy in the world.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.708
Oh, what a cute lab.
What's his name?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.751
Labby.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.712
Yeah, I came up with that.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.508
Wow!
Now, this is an amazing city.

07:47.592 --> 07:52.180
You know, uh, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.725
This is the biggest office
I've ever had.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.060
I have a little confession
to make too.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.478
If I don't get something
to eat soon

07:59.562 --> 08:02.106
I'm gonna have to eat Labby.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.983
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's almost 9 o'clock.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.569
No wonder you're starving.
Here, this will hold you.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.614
- You like peanut butter?
- Oh, creamy, I love creamy.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.865
Is there another kind?

08:10.948 --> 08:12.116
[chuckling]

08:12.200 --> 08:15.328
- Here, ladies first.
- Oh, thank you.

08:15.411 --> 08:20.082
To the best first day of work
that I have ever had.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.751
Cheers. Oh, dear.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.960
Oh.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.297
Hey, how about tomorrow night

08:26.380 --> 08:28.049
I take you out
for a real dinner?

08:28.132 --> 08:29.967
Hmm?

08:30.051 --> 08:32.345
[chuckling]

08:34.554 --> 08:37.099
[coughing]

08:41.062 --> 08:43.188
Is that a yes?

08:43.272 --> 08:46.150
No.
See, here's the thing.

08:46.234 --> 08:50.655
I have a rule,
a strict, very strict rule.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.782
I do not date people
I work with.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.618
Well, it wouldn't be a date.
It's a thank-you meal.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.995
Yeah, it's only a date
if I kiss you good night.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.831
Hmm. Oh, no.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.834
Val, wait, do me a favor,
just think about it overnight

09:03.918 --> 09:06.128
and look, if tomorrow
the answer is still no

09:06.212 --> 09:07.630
then I'll drop it.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.091
- Peter--
- Unh-unh, tomorrow.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.593
Okay, tomorrow

09:12.677 --> 09:14.470
but the answer
is still gonna be no.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.266
Oh, I am so screwed.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.978
[instrumental music]

09:26.941 --> 09:28.818
Alright, I'm taking off.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.820
I'll see you guys <i> manana.</i>

09:30.903 --> 09:32.238
- Peace.
- Bye.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.698
He's a great guy, huh?

09:33.781 --> 09:38.411
Oh, the best. The best.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.788
I can't wait for <i> manana.</i>

09:42.456 --> 09:44.166
I'll be right back.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.296
[whispering]
Hey, is he okay?

09:48.379 --> 09:49.714
I think so. Why?

09:49.797 --> 09:52.258
He's been acting really weird.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.678
Well, uh, you know, is
everything okay with you guys?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.680
Yeah, it's great.
It's, like, better than ever.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.098
Oh, maybe you ought to
tell him that.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.683
- He knows.
- Maybe he doesn't.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.476
- Of course he does.
- Maybe you're wrong.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.728
Maybe if you don't tell me
what you know

10:03.811 --> 10:06.188
you'll get my foot in your ass.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.025
Okay, I'm only telling you this
because I care about him.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.569
Henry is having a little
problem with Vince.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.238
- What kind of problem?
- Um, he's jealous.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.991
What? That's ridiculous.
Vince is just my friend.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.200
I know, I know, but, you know

10:18.284 --> 10:19.618
sometimes guys
can get a little weird

10:19.702 --> 10:21.871
about their girlfriends
having <i> guy friends.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:24.540
You're a guy.
He's not jealous of you.

10:24.623 --> 10:27.543
He doesn't find me attractive.

10:27.626 --> 10:28.878
Now, can you believe that?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.379
Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.716
I know, look at my perfect,
V-shaped body.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.009
- Henry?
- Wait, Holly.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.719
- Don't tell him I told you.
- I won't.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.846
Gary told me
you're jealous of Vince.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.393
I can't believe
you feel like this.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.228
Uh, I know. I'm sorry.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.523
I feel stupid, but there's
something about that guy

10:49.607 --> 10:51.567
that just..
I don't know.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.820
Whenever I see you two together,
he's like..

10:54.904 --> 10:56.530
You know,
you're always laughing.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.157
He's all edgy and cool.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.076
But he's not you.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.745
Who did I spend every single
day this summer with?

11:02.828 --> 11:05.247
Who did I call every single
night before I went to bed?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.125
You, you! I love you!

11:12.171 --> 11:15.466
- What?
- Nothing.

11:15.549 --> 11:19.053
Ah! I am so glad you said that!

11:19.136 --> 11:20.763
I've been wanting
to say it for so long

11:20.846 --> 11:22.598
but I didn't want to be
the one to say it first

11:22.681 --> 11:25.351
because, because
if you didn't say it back

11:25.434 --> 11:27.478
I don't think
I could take it.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.021
Oh!

11:30.189 --> 11:31.774
I love you too.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.359
Mmm.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.866
[instrumental music]

11:42.034 --> 11:43.953
- Oh, thank God!
- Thank God.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.080
(both)
What?

11:46.163 --> 11:48.207
I think I just made
a huge mistake.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.167
- Well, I think I'm about to.
- Who's gonna go first?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.460
- Me.
- Me, me, me!

11:51.544 --> 11:53.045
Oh, I win, I was louder.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.630
Okay, now,
I'm gonna tell you this

11:54.713 --> 11:57.508
but you have to promise not
to say I told you so.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.510
- I can't promise that.
- Alright, I can't tell you.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.803
Okay, fine,
I promise, I promise.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.054
- Tell me.
- Alright.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.973
Peter asked me to
go out on a date

12:04.056 --> 12:06.183
and I think I want to go.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.519
Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.980
Alright, tell me everything,
everything.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.524
Okay, uh, we were working,
and it was late

12:13.607 --> 12:15.734
then we stopped working,
and he got charming.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.653
Then, all of a sudden,
he got real charming

12:17.736 --> 12:19.155
and there was peanut butter.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.573
Peanut butter?

12:20.656 --> 12:23.159
Not for that.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.162
What am I doing? I don't need
a boyfriend right now

12:26.245 --> 12:27.496
especially not a guy
I work with.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.166
You know what I went through
with Vic.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.501
Nothing!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.003
You went through nothing!

12:34.086 --> 12:37.173
Oh, my God, you never
even went out with Vic!

12:37.256 --> 12:40.134
All you ever did was come home
and whine about your feelings

12:40.217 --> 12:42.303
and how you couldn't act on them
because he was your boss.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.221
Yeah, I know, and I cannot go
through that again.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.307
Me neither,
so go out with him!

12:47.558 --> 12:48.934
But what if--

12:49.018 --> 12:52.354
Okay, when is the last time
you took a risk of any kind?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.398
When I asked you
to move in with me.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.151
And how great is that going?

12:57.234 --> 12:59.945
That's true, but what if
we start going out

13:00.029 --> 13:01.655
and we start really
liking each other

13:01.739 --> 13:03.407
then he tells me he never
wants to get married

13:03.491 --> 13:04.658
we go through
a painful breakup

13:04.742 --> 13:06.035
and I still have to work
with him?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.204
But isn't it so much easier
to work with a jerk

13:08.287 --> 13:10.372
that you're totally over
than working with someone

13:10.456 --> 13:12.249
who you're constantly
wondering about?

13:13.792 --> 13:15.794
Go ahead, try to find
a hole in that.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.546
Ain't gonna happen.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.715
- Alright, I'll do it.
- Yay!

13:19.798 --> 13:21.008
- But what if--
- You're going.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.551
- No, I'm just saying--
- Stop saying.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.095
- I really don't--
- Okay, stop thinking.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.473
Hold it I'll be right there.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.849
[telephone ringing]

13:28.933 --> 13:31.393
Hello? Oh, hey, Henry.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.896
Uh, no, I was just talking
to my sister.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.358
Mmm, no, no, it's okay.
I think we're pretty much done.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.322
Really? You love me?

13:43.405 --> 13:46.408
No, that's nine,
but who's counting?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.410
Oop! Ten.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.082
[instrumental music]

13:59.129 --> 14:00.422
Hey, you okay?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.258
You sounded kind of weird
on the phone.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.843
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.555
Um, I may not be in a minute

14:07.638 --> 14:12.351
because I have to tell you
something that may upset you.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.520
Vince is coming?

14:14.603 --> 14:16.939
What? No, no.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.774
It's about you and me.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.734
Well, me.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.361
Okay, let's sit down.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.618
I said something yesterday

14:29.702 --> 14:32.496
that I may not have completely
and totally meant

14:32.580 --> 14:34.415
the way that you heard it.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.710
- You don't love me.
- No.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.297
I mean, not yet.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.300
So, this was just like
a really mean joke?

14:44.383 --> 14:47.469
Oh, no, no, Henry, no.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.388
I just felt so bad that
you were jealous of Vince

14:49.471 --> 14:51.974
and I just,
I got a little carried away

14:52.057 --> 14:55.311
and I wanted you to know
how I feel about you.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.896
How do you feel about me?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.607
I always thought that
when I said it

14:59.690 --> 15:00.733
I would know what I was feeling

15:00.816 --> 15:02.526
and I don't know
what I'm feeling

15:02.610 --> 15:05.446
so I don't think
it's love, yet.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.990
So, you don't love me, yet.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.827
I think I'm close.

15:11.910 --> 15:15.331
Like, I'm at I lo you.

15:17.041 --> 15:21.003
So, how close would you say
you are to the ve?

15:22.421 --> 15:27.718
- Really close.
- Like ten minutes, two years?

15:27.801 --> 15:29.553
Prom would be cool.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.890
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.433
If you want,
you could take yours back.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.101
- No.
- I would totally understand.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.562
I don't want to.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.149
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.152
I have to warn you though,
I'm gonna wear you down.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.820
Bring it on.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.366
[instrumental music]

15:52.826 --> 15:54.703
Oh, wow, what's this?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.372
Peanut-butter cheesecake.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.707
Oh, my God, peanut butter
and cheesecake?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.085
Can they do that?

16:01.168 --> 16:04.296
To the best second day of work
that I've ever had.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.552
Oh, yes!

16:10.636 --> 16:11.887
Oh, sorry.

16:11.970 --> 16:15.557
Okay, you know what?
I have to be honest with you.

16:15.641 --> 16:19.186
In my mind, this doesn't feel
like a thank-you meal.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.230
It feels like a date.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.815
I thought you said
it was a date

16:22.898 --> 16:25.109
only if you kissed me
good night.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.444
In my mind, I already did.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.197
- How was it?
- Hang on, we're not done.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.575
Oh, excellent.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.995
Peter?

16:37.079 --> 16:39.456
Oh, Nicole.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.713
- Uh, this is Val Tyler.
- Hi.

16:45.796 --> 16:49.133
- Our table's ready.
- Oh, hi, Bob.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.474
That, uh,
that was Nicole and Bob.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.101
Oh, I sense a little--

16:59.184 --> 17:01.270
Yeah, there's a little
history there.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.439
- Old girlfriend?
- Oh, no, no.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.523
Uh, Nicole and I kind of..

17:05.607 --> 17:07.984
See, she and Bob were having
marital problems

17:08.068 --> 17:09.444
and my car was in the shop

17:09.528 --> 17:12.196
so we were both feeling
kind of vulnerable.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.241
You know,
how those things can happen.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.286
Marital problems, as in she was
still with Bob when you two--

17:17.368 --> 17:19.538
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not what you think.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.624
- Oh.
- Uh, see, she wasn't happy.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.838
What,
she was still married to Bob.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.631
But she wasn't happy.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.554
They were having intimacy
issues, and she and I weren't.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.224
I mean, we really weren't.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.645
Anyway, look how happy
they are again

17:43.729 --> 17:45.647
and I don't mind
taking a little credit.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.611
What are you talking about?

17:50.694 --> 17:52.070
I think the stuff that we did

17:52.154 --> 17:54.573
she would bring home
and try out on good old Bob.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.827
Kind of heated things up
for them again.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.079
You know, in a weird way

18:01.163 --> 18:03.332
I was kind of like
a marriage counselor.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.086
Oh.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.712
What?

18:08.796 --> 18:11.548
You have no idea
how happy I am right now.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.510
Well, I am feeling pretty
happy myself.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.806
Did you know
I was up all night

18:18.889 --> 18:20.933
thinking about
how adorable you were

18:21.016 --> 18:22.476
and charming and sexy?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.520
Uh, I was really worried
it was gonna be a problem

18:24.603 --> 18:26.021
because, you know,
you're my boss

18:26.105 --> 18:30.901
but it's so not a problem
because you are a pig.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.903
So, thank you
for the thank-you dinner

18:32.986 --> 18:36.365
and I will see you tomorrow
at work with no potential

18:36.448 --> 18:38.617
messy, sexual complications.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.745
- Uh, Val?
- Yeah?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.456
Last night when you were
thinking about me

18:44.540 --> 18:46.875
were you in the tub?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.628
Oh, yeah, this just keeps
getting better and better.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.297
[instrumental music]

18:54.925 --> 18:56.760
[instrumental music]

18:58.470 --> 19:01.890
- Hey!
- Oh, I like that hey.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.475
I love you so much.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.227
Who doesn't?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.356
Thank you for making me
go out with Peter.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.066
Oh, you're welcome.
What happened?

19:11.149 --> 19:13.318
Oh, he took me to a really
great restaurant.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.736
- Where?
- Oh, whatever.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.072
- Some really romantic place.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.699
Then he, he did everything
perfectly.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.242
He ordered the best wine,
the best dinner.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.077
Oh, and he was so nice
to the waiters.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.871
I thought,
"Oh, my God, this is it."

19:23.954 --> 19:25.831
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.126
Then, I found out he had an
affair with a married woman.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.837
Oh, crap.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.714
So, why'd you come
in here all, "Hey?"

19:33.797 --> 19:35.382
Because now my problem
is solved.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.426
I don't have to worry
about dating the boss

19:37.509 --> 19:39.011
or wonder what it would
be like to date the boss

19:39.094 --> 19:42.222
because I dated the boss,
and the boss is nauseating.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.102
Well, did you at least stay
for dessert?

19:47.185 --> 19:49.438
Oh, yeah, peanut-butter
cheesecake in my purse.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.440
Good woman.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.775
Oh, you know what I remembered
halfway through dinner?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.235
Last night, you said
you made a mistake

19:55.319 --> 19:56.528
but we never got
to talk about it.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.697
Oh, I took care of it.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.741
- What?
- It's no big deal.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.659
I accidentally
told Henry I loved him

20:02.743 --> 20:04.453
and then, I kind
of had to take it back.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.788
Oh, my God! Why?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.123
'Cause I'm not really there yet

20:08.206 --> 20:10.250
and I don't want to say it
just to say it.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.419
I want to mean it.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.004
Wow.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.756
What?

20:15.839 --> 20:19.384
Nothing, it's just you handled
that really well.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.137
All mature and everything.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.805
That's good, right?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.807
Yeah. No, it's great.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.935
I guess you just
don't need me anymore.

20:28.018 --> 20:31.480
What? Of course I do.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.648
You know what I did?

20:32.731 --> 20:35.901
I thought to myself,
"What would Val do?"

20:35.984 --> 20:38.153
- Liar.
- I did!

20:38.236 --> 20:42.491
I didn't say it out loud,
but you're in my head.

20:42.574 --> 20:46.119
- I'm in your head?
- Totally, and you know what?

20:46.203 --> 20:48.246
I'm gonna have more problems.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.499
Could get arrested
for shoplifting.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.960
You know how I love stuff.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.170
And, yeah, you're not gonna do
that, but if you did

20:55.253 --> 20:56.546
I would know exactly what to do.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.092
- Mm-hmm, yeah, you would.
- Hmm.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.427
Oh, my God, I just remembered
another problem.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.845
Oh, what?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.682
There's this girl sitting on a
couch and having a fabulous

21:06.765 --> 21:08.642
conversation
with the best sister ever

21:08.725 --> 21:11.395
and she's eating this amazing
peanut-butter cheesecake.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.189
She's totally comfortable,
but she's dying of thirst.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.900
What does she do?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.861
- She needs milk, huh?
- Yeah, she does.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.530
Oh, well, I would tell her

21:21.613 --> 21:24.616
to get her thirsty butt up off
the couch and get it herself.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.955
