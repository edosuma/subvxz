-Pick up the cake

02:11.215 --> 02:14.510

That's whack... basically,
you're making it look like

06:53.497 --> 06:55.249

So, yo, you ever

Yo, baby, what I told you

08:28.467 --> 08:29.551
All right, let's bounce, baby.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.347
His monkey-ass ain't worked
a hard day in his life.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.726
That's why he don't know how
to act with all of that money.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.688
Think he the king of Harlem.

08:42.773 --> 08:46.693
I hope your sister know
with that fool...

08:46.777 --> 08:49.363
it's only a matter of time.

A matter of time.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.246
Well, congratulations!

08:58.288 --> 09:00.958
Good job, and you really put it

09:01.041 --> 09:03.627
And now,

All right, now, let me

09:10.217 --> 09:12.636
Now, you did this side yet?
-I did.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.721
Nah, it don't look like
you did this side. Stop lying.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.889

09:15.973 --> 09:18.058
Look, first of all, man,
you gotta get you a toothbrush.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.102
You ain't gonna be able to
keep the white bottom clean

09:20.185 --> 09:21.270
without it, all right?

09:21.353 --> 09:24.314
Secondly, man, tuck
the laces in. You buggin' out.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.692
You don't give nobody
a chance to, God.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.777
Give you a chance? You gotta
do it in the beginning.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.696
You don't get the shoelaces
all wet and dirty,

09:30.779 --> 09:32.364
man can't start calling you
a poo putt.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.741
You know what I'm sayin'?
All right?

09:34.825 --> 09:35.742
All right, man.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.247
Who is it?!

09:40.289 --> 09:41.790
It's Ace.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.709
Hey, Boogie.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.921
What's up, nigga?
-What's up, man?

09:48.005 --> 09:48.964
What's up, homeboy?
-I'm chillin', man.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.799
Everything all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.134
Oh, yeah,

09:52.217 --> 09:53.969
I need you to do me
a favor if you can, man.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.180
Run some clothes down to the
cleaners for me if you could.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.931
Okay, cool, man.
-That's cool?

09:58.015 --> 10:00.017
I know it's hectic for you
out here and all that.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.603
Keisha! Keisha!

10:02.686 --> 10:04.605
What?!
-This nigga A. here.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.065
Hey, Ace.
I didn't know you was here.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.609
Go in the back
and get them clothes for me

10:08.692 --> 10:09.902
so he can bring them
to Mr. Pip's.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.904
Nigga, what's wrong
with your big-ass feet?

10:11.987 --> 10:13.280
What, man?

10:13.363 --> 10:16.158
Get you in need of some grease
for them whack-ass baby hairs.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.326
Shut up.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.785
And tuck in that little butt.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.704
Nobody wants to
see that little butt.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.956
Whassup, Ace?
-Whassup, little man?

10:22.998 --> 10:24.917
Hey, Mitch,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.044
I can't, little man. I'm busy,
B. I gotta go to work.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.212
I got you, man.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.588
He don't know nothin'
about no hoops.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.964
You need to be
comin' to me for that.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.008
I'll have you workin' on your
left hand. You'll do nice.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.259
All right, man,
I'll see you later.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.762
You talkin' back.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.600
You just came for the clothes?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.228
Nah. Pfft.
What you talkin' about?

Yeah. Here you go.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.355
Could you take some

Just a few things.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.400
Yeah, I'll be right there.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.360
Okay.
-Go ahead, man.

Thank you.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.531

11:37.614 --> 11:39.408
Come in.
You want something to drink?

11:43.453 --> 11:46.832
But I'll take that

Okay, what kind of name

12:46.683 --> 12:48.977
Come on, man.
Anybody could do that.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.980
You think you slick? You trying

13:17.589 --> 13:19.299
You know my style, baby.

13:19.383 --> 13:21.051
It ain't my style
to be running around here

13:21.134 --> 13:22.636
getting all sweaty
on the court, baby.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.596
So, that's your little

13:24.680 --> 13:27.766
It's fly, right?
-Yeah, it's fly.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.227

13:35.232 --> 13:36.817
No, no, no, no.
-Straight-up pussy magnet, man.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.068
You gonna have
no problems, man.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.862
It ain't my flow, man.
-Oh, it ain't your flow.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.698
Oh, you too smooth, now?
That's what it is?

13:42.781 --> 13:44.032
Nah, man, it's you.

Oh, it's me.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.327

13:59.423 --> 14:01.925

14:03.343 --> 14:05.846
Yeah, nigga's got jokes.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.557
In 10 years, me and you

14:08.640 --> 14:09.641
10 years?

14:09.725 --> 14:13.896

17:09.988 --> 17:14.076
It's a sturdy washer and dryer!

17:17.538 --> 17:19.832
You're stupid.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.583
Whatever!

17:32.177 --> 17:33.136
Come on, Ace!

17:33.220 --> 17:34.513
How many times
I gotta tell you

17:34.596 --> 17:36.557

shit playing in the store?

17:36.598 --> 17:38.767
What you want me to do?
Like, not listen to the radio...

17:38.851 --> 17:39.768
What?!

17:39.852 --> 17:41.645
I said, half the time,
you ain't even in here!

17:41.728 --> 17:44.147
What you want me to do, sit in
here and not listen to no music?

17:44.189 --> 17:46.108
It don't make no difference
if I'm here or not!

17:46.191 --> 17:48.193
It's my rules, my radio,
my store, my music!

17:48.277 --> 17:50.070
You know I don't listen
to this shit!

17:50.153 --> 17:51.613
I... I can't even
understand them!

17:51.697 --> 17:53.824
Look, can you even
understand this shit?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.158
It's for my ears.
Yes, I understand it.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.535
Yeah, you can understand
that bullshit,

17:56.618 --> 17:58.662
but you can't understand
when I tell you not to...

18:00.080 --> 18:02.624
Yeah. That's it.
That's what I'm talking about.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.794
You hear that? You hear that?
That's music. That's singing.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.087
There's beauty in singing.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.463
That other shit
is just talking.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.507
"Yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak."

18:10.591 --> 18:12.718
That's what I'm talking about,
you understand what I'm saying?

18:12.801 --> 18:14.219
That's quality shit.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.638
Hello?

Yes, indeed.
I'm takin' care of you, too.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.411
It's all good.

20:44.495 --> 20:47.206
Yep. You're so damn neat
with your money.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.999
Come on, man.
You know me, man.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.876
Cleanliness is
next to Godliness.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.962
What's up, little niggas?
How y'all livin'?

20:59.551 --> 21:04.348
You left this in your pants
last time.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.392
Do you always return everything
you find in the laundry?

21:07.476 --> 21:08.810
Nah.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.771
I didn't think so.

21:10.854 --> 21:14.983
You find something
in there, you keep it.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.527
It's a tip for you.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.195
This?
-Mm-hmm.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.198
That's nothing for me.
My job brings me plenty.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.908
But you ain't no drug dealer.

21:24.701 --> 21:25.953
I'm not?

21:26.036 --> 21:28.121
Moneymakin' Mitch.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.790
Tell me somethin' good, baby.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.501
It's all good, lce.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.752
I know it is.

21:33.836 --> 21:36.713
Why am I not a drug dealer?

21:36.797 --> 21:38.549
I'm sayin'
I don't see you outside.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.384
The way you dress...
you dress nice.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.593
What about your friends?

21:41.677 --> 21:43.470
They dress nice. Fancy.

21:43.554 --> 21:45.931
Tuck them laces in, all right?
Don't be slackin' on that.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.641
Yeah, he's your
right-hand man, now.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.936
Next week, nigga.
-Makin' that real money.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.230
Yeah, but you... you dress
nice-nice, you understand?

21:53.313 --> 21:56.066
They dress...
whatever, loud-nice.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.610
Okay. Thank you.

21:58.694 --> 22:00.529
You don't even
got a car, do you?

22:00.612 --> 22:02.197
What do I need a car for?

22:02.281 --> 22:04.324
Family movin' up
in the business.

22:04.408 --> 22:07.327
I know
you gonna look after family.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.663
What family
you talking about, lce?

22:09.746 --> 22:12.166
Fuck,
I look invisible, nigga?

22:12.207 --> 22:13.667
Did I pass the test, compre?

22:13.709 --> 22:14.751
It's not...

22:14.835 --> 22:17.504
it's not a test.
I'm just sayin'...

22:17.588 --> 22:18.922
You like money, right?

22:20.674 --> 22:21.800
Yeah.

22:21.884 --> 22:25.095
I'm broke, baby.
I ain't got no money.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.180
Bullshit.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.681
I see you shinin', nigga.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.975
I can smell a motherfucker
with money.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.812
Even Ray Charles could see
you got money.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.148
Dang.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.025
Look at this nigga.

22:38.108 --> 22:40.360
Little Sonny and his crew,
the future of our nation.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.154
Ain't that a bitch?

22:49.912 --> 22:51.205
Damn, man.

22:51.288 --> 22:54.958
You got the John Wayne shit,
man.

22:55.042 --> 22:58.462
Fuckin' gun all up in the
007 compartment, man. Damn.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.130
Well, the way you dress,
nigga,

23:00.214 --> 23:02.174
you ain't got to worry
about those cats.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.551
You'll be invisible up in
the club.

23:04.635 --> 23:06.220
Exactly.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.388
Nah, I'm just
fuckin' with you, bud.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.185
What you doin', man?
What's that?

23:16.230 --> 23:17.856
You tell me, man.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.568
It looks like coke, nigga.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.534
You fuck me up, A.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.161
You never say shit, B.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.622
Just come out the blue
with some coke, huh?

23:35.165 --> 23:37.668
To tell you the truth, I ain't
fuckin' with coke right now.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.211
The shit
just ain't clickin', B.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.796
You know what you
need to do, man?

23:40.879 --> 23:43.382
You need to fuck with that cat
your sister be talkin' to,

23:43.465 --> 23:44.550
that nigga, Calvin, man.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.592
He sells coke.

23:45.676 --> 23:47.928
Nah, I ain't fuckin'
with that nigga, man.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.263
Nigga's dumb.

23:52.516 --> 23:54.142
Hey, man, what, man?

23:54.226 --> 23:56.061
What you mean, "What?"

23:56.144 --> 23:57.938
I'm just tryin' to picture
Mr. Jefferson

23:57.980 --> 23:59.147
hustlin' on these streets.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.526
I've seen you roll up
in the black Saab

24:02.609 --> 24:04.778
with the gold BBS's, man.

24:04.820 --> 24:05.946
I said, "Damn,

24:05.988 --> 24:08.282
this dickety-stick
is really makin' this money.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.617
He's really makin' money,
man," you understand?

24:10.659 --> 24:11.743
Listen, hey

24:11.827 --> 24:14.163
It ain't just about the money.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.497
It's not.

24:15.581 --> 24:18.834
You know what it's about, man?

24:18.917 --> 24:22.379
It's about fuckin' those
skeezers like that right there,

24:22.462 --> 24:24.882
it's about drivin'
these fly-ass cars,

24:24.965 --> 24:28.385
and it's definitely about never
dressin' like a nigga like you.

24:28.427 --> 24:29.970
Okay, man.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.556
Come on, man. Let's go be stars
up in this joint, all right?

24:33.849 --> 24:35.267
Yeah, baby!
Dance it up, y'all!

24:35.350 --> 24:37.227
Go on and get out there
and move it!

24:39.646 --> 24:41.648
Come on!

24:41.732 --> 24:45.068
Come on!

24:45.110 --> 24:47.279
Yeah! This is
all about boogie.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.948
We boogie nonstop.

24:50.032 --> 24:51.700
We at the top.
We got it goin' on.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.994
A'ight, here we go.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.705
What's up? What's up, man?
-Hey, hey.

24:56.747 --> 24:58.582
Hey, my man!

24:58.665 --> 25:00.959
Ladies' lookin' good...

25:03.337 --> 25:04.838
Yeah!

25:04.880 --> 25:08.050
Mitch was a real star

25:08.133 --> 25:13.138
See, when the lights caught him,
he always looked good.

25:13.222 --> 25:15.224
Yo, my man,
Mitch, in the house!

25:15.307 --> 25:17.059
Yeah! Lookin' good, King!
I see you!

25:17.100 --> 25:18.310
A'ight, here we go!

25:18.393 --> 25:21.146
And Mitch got love
from everybody.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.399
I mean, everybody.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.953
What are you doing?

26:17.995 --> 26:20.289
Go to sleep, little man.

27:58.554 --> 28:01.640
Lucky, you're up.
You workin' today?

28:01.723 --> 28:04.726
You know,
don't call me "Lucky," Ma.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.896
Been a long time since

28:07.980 --> 28:10.774
I found food stamps
or something like that.

28:10.858 --> 28:14.528
Now, don't forget
when you picked that $700...

28:14.570 --> 28:16.905
Ma, that was when I was 12,
you know what I'm sayin'?

28:16.947 --> 28:19.575
I'm grown now, and there ain't
a whole lot lucky to do with me

28:19.658 --> 28:21.410
getting up and goin' to
work right now,

28:21.493 --> 28:24.079
so I don't wanna be called
"Lucky." Thanks, Mom.

28:24.163 --> 28:26.665
All right, baby.

28:40.846 --> 28:44.725
Guess your sister got to get
a better man now.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.935
Boy just got busted
by the cops.

28:52.316 --> 28:54.693
He was dealing right in
front of your building.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.487
Didn't I tell you?

28:57.571 --> 29:00.157
Can't do shit
with that cash now

29:00.240 --> 29:02.659
except hire a lawyer.

29:02.743 --> 29:04.578
Did you see it?

29:04.620 --> 29:06.163
Nah.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.582
I heard about it
on the way over here.

29:08.665 --> 29:11.251
Cops must've been watching
his dumb ass.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.422
Yo, chief,
you seen Calvin?

29:15.506 --> 29:17.174
Nah, he got locked up.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.176
Yo, takin' his place?

29:23.096 --> 29:24.306
Never mind.

29:24.389 --> 29:25.849
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

29:25.933 --> 29:28.644
Hold on one second, man.
What, um...

29:28.685 --> 29:30.687
what you lookin' for?

29:30.729 --> 29:31.939
Just one.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.277
A'ight.

29:47.538 --> 29:49.832
Fuck, B.

29:49.915 --> 29:50.958
One.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.085
You ain't got no bottle?

29:53.168 --> 29:55.087
What? Bottle?

29:55.170 --> 29:57.297
What you need
a bottle for, man?

29:57.381 --> 29:58.841
Plastic bottle, whatever?

30:00.634 --> 30:02.845
Damn,
this is a big-ass rock, B.

30:06.473 --> 30:11.103
All this for a hundred?

30:11.186 --> 30:14.606
Man, this is better than
Calvin's stuff. Word up.

30:14.690 --> 30:17.651
Yo, I could hook up
with you later, right?

30:17.734 --> 30:20.070
Nah, man, I'm...
across the street.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.281
The building
across the street.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.867
All right, G.
Peace out.

30:27.870 --> 30:30.372
You know what this is?

30:30.455 --> 30:32.207
Yeah. It's coke.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.835
Yes,
but that's a kilo of coke.

30:34.918 --> 30:37.296
How much is it worth?

30:37.379 --> 30:39.256
$25,000.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.340
Damn.

30:40.424 --> 30:41.341
No "damn."

30:41.425 --> 30:43.135
Damn, that's damn good, okay?

30:43.218 --> 30:44.428
A'ight, I'm sayin'...

30:44.511 --> 30:46.597
The shit on the street
is garbage.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.267
This crud that's washed
with acetone and kerosene.

30:50.350 --> 30:51.977
This is the best product,

30:52.060 --> 30:56.023
and you gonna be the only one
in the street holding this.

30:56.106 --> 30:57.149
$25,000.

30:57.232 --> 30:59.318
$25,000 is the street price.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.195
Of that, I get $18,000.

31:01.278 --> 31:03.280
$7,000.

31:03.363 --> 31:06.158
That's right,
for every key that you move.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.618
You know I...

31:07.701 --> 31:10.412
I still got my job
at the cleaners, um

31:10.496 --> 31:12.164
No, it's perfect, man,

31:12.247 --> 31:14.708
because that's how
everybody knows you... as Ace.

31:15.834 --> 31:16.919
Forget about heroin.

31:17.002 --> 31:19.588
This is the wave
of the future, baby.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.718
Crazy, man.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.345
I'm gonna give you

31:26.428 --> 31:29.556
an eighth of a key, okay?

31:29.598 --> 31:31.350
Break it up.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.352
Do like you did with the rock.

31:33.435 --> 31:38.190
See me in four days, okay?

31:38.273 --> 31:39.358
'Sup, niggas?

31:39.441 --> 31:41.568
How you niggas livin'?

Everything good out here?

31:43.237 --> 31:44.321

31:44.404 --> 31:46.448
Good, good, good.
How you feel, baby?

31:46.532 --> 31:47.449
Chillin'.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.535
Got that money for me, man?
I gotta make moves.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.286
Yeah, I got it,
but not all of it, yo.

31:51.328 --> 31:52.871
What you mean,

31:52.955 --> 31:53.956
I got robbed, yo.

31:54.039 --> 31:55.707
Park it around the block!

31:55.791 --> 31:56.875
Around the block, man!

31:56.959 --> 31:59.586
The fuck you mean you got

31:59.628 --> 32:01.463
Got robbed, man.
That nigga, Duff.

32:03.298 --> 32:04.758
Nigga Duff?

32:04.800 --> 32:07.010
Let this nigga Duff up on you,
man, and take your shit?

32:07.094 --> 32:08.136
And my piece, man.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.638
You had your fuckin' gun
on you, man?

32:09.680 --> 32:11.181
What the fuck is
wrong with y'all niggas?

32:11.265 --> 32:12.349
You niggas stand out here

32:12.432 --> 32:14.184

32:14.268 --> 32:15.978
You gonna let this nigga
come and take your shit?

32:16.061 --> 32:17.145
Aren't you a motherfuckin' man?

32:17.187 --> 32:19.857
You wanna let another man
take your shit, B.?

32:19.940 --> 32:22.192
You done lost your privilege
of getting any money, man,

32:22.276 --> 32:24.111
until you show me
where that man is at.

32:24.194 --> 32:26.697
Until you find that man,

32:26.780 --> 32:28.907
A'ight? You hear what

32:28.991 --> 32:30.993
Now, get the fuck

32:31.076 --> 32:33.036
Go ahead, man.
Go find that man, B.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.873
Go find him, B., unless

32:35.956 --> 32:38.292
Go this way, man.
Hey, my man, go this way, man.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.877
Go that way, man.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.920
Them niggas don't seem
to understand me out here, B.

32:42.004 --> 32:43.505
Nobody playing games

32:43.589 --> 32:45.340
Y'all niggas better hold it down

32:45.424 --> 32:47.509
Them niggas gonna be lookin' for
motherfucking work in Queens

32:47.593 --> 32:48.677

32:48.760 --> 32:51.346
This is Harlem, man. Y'all

32:55.517 --> 32:57.686
Y'all don't know nothin'
about this.

32:57.728 --> 33:00.772
Things really got hot in Harlem
when "Scarface" came to town.

33:02.107 --> 33:05.527
It was like niggas love
seein' a poor-ass Cuban

33:05.569 --> 33:08.697

to be the man all by himself.

33:13.869 --> 33:15.787
You wait for me.

You wanna fuck with me?

33:35.098 --> 33:36.183
Okay.

33:36.266 --> 33:39.436
You cockroaches.
Come on.

33:40.938 --> 33:43.106
You wanna play games?

33:45.901 --> 33:47.778
Come on.

33:48.904 --> 33:51.323
You wanna play rough?!

33:51.406 --> 33:52.616
Okay.

33:52.699 --> 33:55.285
Say hello to my little friend!

34:06.046 --> 34:07.965
You want more?!

34:17.181 --> 34:19.810
Mitch backed up his words

34:19.893 --> 34:21.728
and ended up doing some time.

34:23.522 --> 34:26.440
Now I'm all by myself
in the game,

34:26.483 --> 34:28.610
just like Scarface.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.199
What's up, old man?

34:39.204 --> 34:41.456
What's going on
over here, man?

34:41.498 --> 34:42.666
Man, bust it.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.458
You ain't taking my messages
or something?

34:44.543 --> 34:46.295
Keisha didn't call?

34:46.335 --> 34:50.047
I dropped some tickets
behind this counter,

34:50.132 --> 34:52.634
and this is what I find.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.469
Is this yours

34:55.554 --> 34:57.598
or you keepin' it
for a friend?

34:57.639 --> 35:00.350
Man, it ain't even like that,
Mr. Pip.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.811
Well, then,
what's it like, Ace?

35:05.355 --> 35:08.150
It really ain't none
of your business what it's like.

35:14.031 --> 35:15.782
It's my store.

35:15.866 --> 35:19.119
Anything up in here
is my business.

35:22.206 --> 35:23.707
You don't have to worry
about that.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.667
I'm gonna take that
out of here.

35:28.045 --> 35:30.797
I got a life of my own.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.549
Oh, check you out.

35:32.633 --> 35:35.886
I guess you know somethin' about
the game Calvin didn't, huh?

35:35.969 --> 35:38.347
Ace, you better say something
to me if you wanna stay here,

35:38.430 --> 35:40.766
'cause, see, I ain't doing
these type of favors for no...

35:40.849 --> 35:42.893
I'm missing one of my tapes.

35:42.976 --> 35:44.853
You seen my tape?

35:51.985 --> 35:54.613
Yeah, you been wantin'

35:56.490 --> 35:58.992
Fine, fuck it, then.
Take your ass home.

36:04.456 --> 36:06.959
I want my $75 on Friday.

36:09.002 --> 36:10.462
What you gonna do with $75,
Kingpin?

36:12.714 --> 36:14.299
Hey, June.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.760
Yeah, hold on a minute.

36:20.138 --> 36:23.225
Hey, Ace. How you doin'?

36:23.308 --> 36:24.977
I'm good.

36:25.060 --> 36:27.187
Your mama ask you
to come pick up something?

36:27.271 --> 36:28.522
Nah.

36:30.107 --> 36:31.900
Oh, so what's going on, honey?

36:31.984 --> 36:34.778
You wanna make some money?

36:36.613 --> 36:37.781

36:37.865 --> 36:39.283
Come on in.

36:39.366 --> 36:40.617
Yo. Check this out.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.369
How many bottles is this?

36:42.411 --> 36:43.579
2,000.

36:43.662 --> 36:46.415
Damn. 2,000 bottles?

36:46.456 --> 36:48.208
That's a lot of
motherfuckin' bottles, man.

36:51.128 --> 36:52.880
$100 a bottle, man,

36:52.963 --> 36:55.299
this shit ain't gonna
never sell fast enough.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.425
All that for $50?

36:56.508 --> 36:57.968
Yo, man, this shit weak

36:58.051 --> 37:00.053
Don't sell me no
-Hey, man, you know me, man.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.597
This the best product
in town, man.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.848
Don't insult me. Here.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.308
Man, fuck it, man.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.435

Give me two of them Jones.

37:06.518 --> 37:07.728
You trippin'.

37:07.769 --> 37:09.813
Yeah, I was trippin', a'ight,

37:09.897 --> 37:13.025
but I was gettin' money...
talkin' 'bout real money.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.776
Bottle this shit up quick, man.

37:14.818 --> 37:16.695
See, other dealers
were selling it

37:16.778 --> 37:18.614
at the highest price
they could get.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.450
I sold it cheaper,
so I was sellin' it faster.

37:21.492 --> 37:22.868
I sold it so cheap,

37:22.951 --> 37:25.037
I started
taking their customers away.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.499
See, I was wholesale
on the streets, you understand?

37:28.582 --> 37:31.335
Hey, Lucky,
you want something to drink?

37:31.418 --> 37:33.128
Don't call me Lucky, I said.

37:33.212 --> 37:34.755
Whatever, Lucky.
What you drinkin'?

37:34.838 --> 37:36.381
Fillin' this all the way up.

37:36.465 --> 37:38.300
Now, in the end,
I made more money,

37:38.342 --> 37:40.761
and Lulu always got his return
when he wanted it.

37:42.304 --> 37:44.556
But I wasn't trying to keep shit
all to myself, see.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.266
I-I wasn't tryin'
to get on the stage,

37:46.308 --> 37:48.101
and I didn't want
people hatin'.

37:48.185 --> 37:49.436
I put people on, understand?

37:50.395 --> 37:51.980
Streets was happy.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.482
Everybody could eat.

37:55.359 --> 37:56.985
Yeah, dealin' was a'ight.

38:23.762 --> 38:25.222
Oooh.

38:29.101 --> 38:30.894

38:43.240 --> 38:45.576

38:51.665 --> 38:53.500

38:55.377 --> 38:56.837

38:58.672 --> 39:00.757

Oh, you don't know

Oh, yeah,

What was up with that?

41:13.849 --> 41:15.517
What you mean
what was up with me at the club?

41:15.601 --> 41:17.060
The club ain't my scene.

41:17.144 --> 41:19.396
I like to go to the club,

41:19.479 --> 41:21.023

I need to talk to,

41:21.106 --> 41:22.482

Everybody checkin' you, checkin'
me, all flashy and shit.

41:24.485 --> 41:25.527
That's not my thing.

41:25.611 --> 41:27.821
You're just borin', that's all.

41:27.905 --> 41:29.490
That's all.

41:33.535 --> 41:35.078
I ain't that boring.

41:35.162 --> 41:36.163
Oooh, oooh.

41:36.246 --> 41:37.456
I really ain't that boring.

41:37.539 --> 41:39.124
Big shit. What, I'm supposed to
take this and go shopping?

41:39.208 --> 41:41.376
If I'm so borin', then,

41:41.418 --> 41:43.003
you know, why you with me?

41:43.086 --> 41:45.547
First of all,
I ain't impressed by that.

41:45.589 --> 41:48.884
I'm with you
'cause I'm borin', too.

41:48.967 --> 41:50.928
A'ight?

41:53.597 --> 41:56.141
Give me that money back
and give me a kiss.

42:07.486 --> 42:09.029
Word to mother, man.

42:09.112 --> 42:10.989
She's feelin' good.

Yo, Ace, right?

42:19.957 --> 42:21.250

Yo, I hear you got that butter.

42:24.127 --> 42:25.504
You holdin'?

42:25.587 --> 42:26.797
You know me, man, or somebody?

42:26.880 --> 42:28.549
I don't think you know me, man,
you know what I'm sayin'?

42:28.632 --> 42:30.551
I think somebody been misleadin'
you, you know what I mean?

42:30.634 --> 42:32.094
Ah, come on, man.
Look at you.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.887
Got this European joint

42:43.522 --> 42:44.898
Yo.
We'll meet up again, right?

42:44.940 --> 42:46.692
Different time,
different circumstances?

42:46.775 --> 42:49.278
Yeah, maybe it'll be love next
time, you know what I'm sayin'?

42:49.319 --> 42:50.279
A'ight.

42:50.320 --> 42:52.114
Maybe.

42:52.156 --> 42:53.365
Corny motherfuckers, man.

42:53.448 --> 42:55.868
Got the silent routine,
his boy with him and shit.

42:57.744 --> 43:00.622
Something was up
with those cats.

43:00.664 --> 43:04.126
They was either stickup kids
or the feds.

43:04.168 --> 43:07.379
Either way,
I wasn't fuckin' with 'em.

43:11.008 --> 43:13.051
Hey, yo, Lulu?

43:15.304 --> 43:17.306
Moneybags?

43:38.785 --> 43:42.915
The messengers.

43:42.998 --> 43:46.543
With $2,000.

43:46.627 --> 43:48.837
Yes, Pedro.

43:48.921 --> 43:51.173
I know you didn't hear it.
I know.

43:51.256 --> 43:53.008
But

43:53.091 --> 43:55.010
Excuse me, um

43:55.093 --> 43:56.094
What's going on?

43:56.178 --> 43:58.805
Do you know this man?

43:58.847 --> 44:00.265
No, um

44:00.349 --> 44:03.268
but I'm here about Lulu.

44:03.352 --> 44:06.605
Lulu... uh

44:09.024 --> 44:12.903
He... somebody killed him.
You know, I found him.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.906
Why come here?

44:18.450 --> 44:20.035
Well, it being that,
you know,

44:20.118 --> 44:22.663

of business together, right?

44:22.746 --> 44:25.249
So, one time
he brought me here before,

44:25.332 --> 44:27.125
so that's why I came here.

44:28.627 --> 44:30.963

44:32.381 --> 44:33.924
200?

44:34.007 --> 44:35.467
Why didn't you keep it?

44:40.514 --> 44:41.431
Damn.

44:41.515 --> 44:42.766
Nah.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.893
I ain't like that, man.

44:44.977 --> 44:46.770
Know what I mean?
Oh, um

Real estate and rocks...

45:19.928 --> 45:22.264

45:39.281 --> 45:40.908
Oh.

Yeah.

45:47.289 --> 45:48.373

48:32.037 --> 48:34.498
Yeah, we get money...
Uptown style, a'ight?

48:34.540 --> 48:36.416
It felt good
to be rollin' through Harlem

48:36.458 --> 48:38.794
top down
and Mitch at the wheel.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.174
I just wanted
to get my man set up

48:44.258 --> 48:46.969
and back where he belong...
on the stage.

48:47.010 --> 48:48.971
The Maximas, the Jettas...

48:49.054 --> 48:50.514
don't know how we do the roll.

48:50.597 --> 48:52.266
We got a lot of things

48:52.307 --> 48:53.809
We got a lot of things

Yeah, I seen him.
Talked to him.

49:09.032 --> 49:10.242
He came up on me.

49:10.325 --> 49:11.743
Oh, uh, Rico.

49:11.827 --> 49:14.371
I had a little confrontation
in there, you know.

49:14.454 --> 49:17.166
He definitely did, uh,
come through, man, you know.

49:17.207 --> 49:19.501
Not sayin' that a nigga
ain't gonna handle

49:19.585 --> 49:21.628
what a nigga gotta handle,
you know.

49:21.712 --> 49:24.506
He definitely did,
but at the same time...

49:24.590 --> 49:27.426
you know, the nigga definitely
did show me some love, so

49:27.509 --> 49:29.678
thinkin' that, you know,
it might be good...

49:29.720 --> 49:31.430
you know, maybe we could throw
him in there somewhere,

49:31.513 --> 49:33.098
you know, I don't know.
We might be able to use...

49:33.182 --> 49:34.808
you know, it's up to you,
you know what I'm sayin'?

49:37.895 --> 49:39.354
Hey, Mitch,
how much this cost?

49:39.396 --> 49:41.648
Man, why you worried about
how much those cost?

49:41.690 --> 49:43.525
You 'bout
to buy a car or somethin'?

49:43.567 --> 49:44.693
Yo

49:44.776 --> 49:47.070
So, when you gonna

49:47.154 --> 49:48.322
Come on, little man,

49:48.405 --> 49:50.449

up in no club.

49:50.532 --> 49:51.783

Look at me, man.

50:05.506 --> 50:06.924
Ice ain't no real man.

50:07.007 --> 50:09.134
A real man
handles his business.

50:09.218 --> 50:11.345
A real man
takes care of his family.

50:11.428 --> 50:12.846
Ice don't do none of that.

50:12.888 --> 50:14.056
You understand?

50:14.097 --> 50:16.266
The only thing you need to be
concerned with right now

50:16.350 --> 50:17.601
is going to school.

50:17.684 --> 50:19.895
That's it, a'ight?
-A'ight.

50:19.937 --> 50:21.480

so I guess that situation with
A. is workin' out pretty good.

50:50.717 --> 50:52.052
Listen, man, you know
I'm gonna do my thing.

50:52.135 --> 50:53.428

50:53.470 --> 50:54.972
That don't mean nothing
but trou--I been down in D.C.

50:55.055 --> 50:56.974

We need to make that happen.

51:04.940 --> 51:06.984
Yo, you spoke to A. about that?

51:07.067 --> 51:09.945

51:15.284 --> 51:16.410
I'm gonna talk to him, B.

51:16.451 --> 51:17.578
I'm gonna talk to him.

51:17.661 --> 51:19.329
That's why I love you.
-I'll talk to him.

51:19.413 --> 51:21.123
That's why I love you.

51:40.893 --> 51:42.060
Oh, yeah?

51:42.144 --> 51:43.979
What you think about that, B.?

51:44.062 --> 51:45.939
Expand like what?
-I don't know.

51:45.981 --> 51:47.983
I didn't really get to talk
to him too much about it.

51:48.025 --> 51:49.860
He talkin' 'bout he wanna go
to D.C. or somethin',

51:49.943 --> 51:51.487

So, all you gotta do,

Half of these niggas

Yo, what's up with your man?

58:47.903 --> 58:49.196

I mean, he's cool and all that.
Don't get me wrong.

58:55.828 --> 58:57.204
Kind of reminds me of you

58:57.287 --> 58:59.665

runnin' 'round broke.

58:59.748 --> 59:02.167
But the point is,
I don't fuckin' need him.

59:02.251 --> 59:04.878
You hot.

59:04.962 --> 59:06.755

59:11.510 --> 59:13.428
Come on, A.,

59:15.389 --> 59:17.182
Is you schooling him

59:17.266 --> 59:18.934
I don't have to do that

59:18.976 --> 59:20.936
Y-You just need
to lay low, man.

59:20.978 --> 59:22.354
That's all you gotta do.

59:22.437 --> 59:23.897
I'm hookin' you up.

59:27.109 --> 59:29.069
Nigga, you got money

59:29.111 --> 59:31.238
I'll deal the block.
It's my block.

59:31.280 --> 59:32.239
No.

59:32.281 --> 59:33.448
You can't do that,

59:33.532 --> 59:34.825
'cause if you get
fuckin' busted,

59:34.908 --> 59:36.326

59:36.410 --> 59:38.537
You understand that?
And I ain't havin' that.

You better have this the way
I'm givin' this to you,

59:50.340 --> 59:51.967
Co, hold on

59:52.009 --> 59:53.635
I said I got it

59:53.677 --> 59:55.637
You know what, A.?

59:55.721 --> 59:58.098
I see you out here,

59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.393
you're doin' your thing

01:00:01.477 --> 01:00:03.395
He's a funny guy

So, I'm gonna step, a'ight?

01:00:07.357 --> 01:00:09.776
But I'll see you later.

You always tellin' me, man?

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:19.328
What the fuck is the use havin'
soldiers if you can't use 'em?

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.997
That's why I'm Rico.
That's why I do what I do, man.

01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:31.632
What's up, baby?

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:34.593
Nothin'.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.270
So, when we gonna
have this kid?

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:50.400
As soon as you start spendin'
more time with me.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.737
Now you're stressin' me?

01:00:53.821 --> 01:00:55.864
Come on, baby.

01:00:55.948 --> 01:00:57.324
It's just

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:03.038

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:06.708
Yes.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.876
Okay.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:10.003
Okay.

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:13.215
It's gonna be fine, baby.

01:01:13.298 --> 01:01:19.054
It's gonna be a nice, fine,
boring life.

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:37.823
Sonny.

01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:39.324

I fa--fa--fall asleep.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:46.290
Where's Mommy?

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:47.541
I think she left.

01:01:47.624 --> 01:01:48.917
She left?

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:50.085

01:01:50.127 --> 01:01:52.588

Yo, don't fuckin'

01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:39.927

a couple bags of groceries

01:02:58.821 --> 01:03:00.864
You ain't supportin' shit.

01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:04.117
You got a pocketful of money!

01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:08.747
You won't even give your mama

01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:10.958
Hey, what about Sonny?

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:13.877

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.523

01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:20.527
I'm sorry about that, man.

01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:22.279
Don't worry, man.

All right?
Meet me at the top.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.717
We're gonna party for real.

01:04:43.759 --> 01:04:44.927
Everything a'ight?

01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:46.220
Everything's cool, man.

01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:48.263
You know, I just need to be

01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:49.681
You a'ight?
-I'm chillin'.

01:04:49.765 --> 01:04:51.391
All right,

I'll show you some love, Mitch.
Come on, Dick. Come on, Dick.

01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:56.355
Get out of here,

01:04:56.438 --> 01:04:57.773
You wanna see some love?
It's love day.

01:04:57.856 --> 01:04:59.358
I'm showin' people love
out here on the court.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:00.859
You ain't ready for me, A.

01:05:00.943 --> 01:05:03.529
I got you. I got you
right here in the pocket.

01:05:03.612 --> 01:05:05.739
All right?
-All right, my nigga.

01:05:05.781 --> 01:05:07.783
Do something,

01:05:08.826 --> 01:05:10.202
I'm sayin' y'all got to know

01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:12.538
who's coming to the stage
to represent.

01:05:12.621 --> 01:05:14.540
Are y'all ready to rock
or what?!

01:05:15.332 --> 01:05:16.959
All right,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.252
we want to bring

01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:20.963

01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:22.798
Doug E. Fresh!

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.054
Everybody from the Rooftop

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:49.301
Make the shot there, baby.
That's all, Mitch.

01:06:49.384 --> 01:06:50.427
Mitch!

01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:52.387
Ah, nigga, that's all.
Give me my money.

01:06:52.471 --> 01:06:53.889
Bet it right back.

01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:55.682
But double up.

01:06:55.766 --> 01:06:58.310
Right here, man.

01:06:58.393 --> 01:07:00.354
What the fuck you mean?
This is

01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:03.732
I ain't giving him his food.

01:07:09.154 --> 01:07:10.531
Hello?

01:07:37.266 --> 01:07:39.601
Get the fuck up, motherfucker!

01:07:40.686 --> 01:07:43.021
Get the fuck up!

01:07:48.694 --> 01:07:50.445
What you waitin' for, man?

01:07:53.657 --> 01:07:57.286
Open the fuckin' safe, nigga!

01:07:57.327 --> 01:07:59.621
Do what they say, Ace.

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:02.207
Open up
the motherfuckin' safe, man.

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:05.252
It's too dark in here, man.
What the fuck?

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:06.420
I can't even see the...

01:08:06.503 --> 01:08:08.714
Yo, get this nigga

01:08:18.599 --> 01:08:22.352
Come on, man.
Open this fuckin' safe.

01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:24.438
Yo, Calvin, man,

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.273
I can tell that's you.
-Well, fuck all that!

01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:28.233
Shut the fuck up!

01:08:28.317 --> 01:08:30.819
Fuckin' asking me "Why this?"
Or "Why that?"

01:08:30.903 --> 01:08:32.779
Now, you think I'm playin'?

01:08:32.821 --> 01:08:34.238
Leave him alone! Please!

01:08:34.323 --> 01:08:35.823
You think I'm playin'?!

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:38.243
Open that fuckin' safe, man!

01:08:39.995 --> 01:08:41.455
Look at me.

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:43.081
No!

01:08:43.165 --> 01:08:46.710
Look at me.
I said look at me!

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:50.005
You think I'm some
Kermit motherfucker now? Huh?

01:08:50.087 --> 01:08:52.131
Listen, man,
don't fuckin' do this, man.

01:08:52.216 --> 01:08:54.760
You think I'm fuckin' playin'?
Open the safe!

01:08:54.843 --> 01:08:55.928
Hold on, man!

01:08:56.011 --> 01:08:59.640
Now, next time
I ain't gonna miss.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.974
A'ight?

01:09:01.058 --> 01:09:02.810
There ain't even no money
in this safe, man.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.978
There ain't shit in here.
I got 100 grand at the crib.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.354
Look at this nigga
playing games.

01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:07.689
There ain't no money
in the safe.

01:09:07.773 --> 01:09:10.359
I can't see
with fuckin' blood in my eyes.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.027
Get his ass up out of here.

01:09:12.069 --> 01:09:13.694
Fuck!
-Take his ass home.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:15.072
Clean him up.

01:09:15.154 --> 01:09:16.365
Get up, man!

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:18.200
Get up, man!

01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:22.496
Get in there, man.

01:09:26.124 --> 01:09:28.042
I told you, I'm not playin'.
Shut the fuck up!

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:31.171
What's
the fuckin' combination? Huh?

01:09:31.212 --> 01:09:32.840
Shut up with that cryin' shit!

01:09:32.923 --> 01:09:35.801
I'm not trying to hear that!
What's the fuckin' combination?

01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:40.055
What...

01:09:40.139 --> 01:09:42.599
M-M-Motherfucker!

01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:30.272
She was 7 pounds

01:10:30.314 --> 01:10:32.483
and her daddy survived.

01:10:38.572 --> 01:10:41.533
Only God and love
could have kept me breathing

01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:43.911
after all those bullets.

01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:48.499
I told myself when I could
breathe without a tube

01:10:48.582 --> 01:10:51.585
I was gonna breathe deep.

01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:01.595
What's up?

01:11:01.678 --> 01:11:04.056
Nigga needs some work, man.
What's goin' on?

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:07.100
Ain't nothin' pumpin'

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:09.478
Come on, man.
I know y'all got something.

01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:10.687
Fuck, is you deaf, man?

01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:13.148
I said we ain't got shit
goin' on right now, B.

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:15.317
So a nigga's supposed to starve
'cause your man got shot?

01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:16.735
What?
-Damn!

01:11:16.819 --> 01:11:18.487
What's that, partner?

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.447
Calvin must got you niggas

01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:22.491
Calvin?

01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:24.535
What, you one of Calvin...

01:11:24.618 --> 01:11:25.953
Is you
one of Calvin's hoes, man?

01:11:27.037 --> 01:11:29.790
Get that nigga
out of the car, man.

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:32.668
Get that bitch out of the car.

01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:34.670
Get the fuck up.
-Shit.

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:37.005
Get up. Do you know
what Calvin did?

01:11:37.047 --> 01:11:38.966
Come on, man. Don't do this.
-Get the fuck undressed.

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.592
Everything!

01:11:40.676 --> 01:11:41.969
What the fuck are you...

01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:45.472
Your sneakers, too!
-All right, man.

01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:47.641
Next time you talk
about Calvin

01:11:47.724 --> 01:11:49.852
Get off the block!

01:11:49.935 --> 01:11:51.228

Watch your fuckin' mouth

01:11:56.108 --> 01:11:58.819
And Rico
wasn't showin' nobody love.

01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:02.030
Bum-ass fuckin' bullshit.

01:12:08.328 --> 01:12:11.540
Hey, yo, A.,

01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:13.375
You be a'ight, nigga.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:14.835
You're tough, right?

01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:19.923
I'm out, Rico.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:21.175
Look at me.

01:12:21.258 --> 01:12:24.303

You understand

01:12:29.558 --> 01:12:31.018
The doctor said I wasn't

01:12:31.101 --> 01:12:33.770
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm out.

01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:36.482
Yo, A., man,

01:12:36.565 --> 01:12:38.150

Come on, man. What you want...

Everybody gettin' antsy

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.749
I know what floats A's boat.

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:58.504
Remember this, nigga?

01:12:58.587 --> 01:12:59.713
We can go right around
the corner.

01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:01.089

All right? Calm down.

01:18:12.109 --> 01:18:13.569
Yo, A., Sonny's gone, man.

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.821

I feel naked out here, B.

01:19:30.479 --> 01:19:34.817
I'm thinking about

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.488

or some basement

01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:41.323

01:20:00.008 --> 01:20:03.679

They're fuckin' dead, man.

01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:18.694
I don't give a fuck

01:20:18.735 --> 01:20:21.864
But I need
my little man back, B.

01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:23.907
I need him back, man.

01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:25.826

14 of them for Sonny.

01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:49.099

01:22:52.848 --> 01:22:54.683
They found Sonny?

01:22:54.725 --> 01:22:57.728
No. Not Sonny.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.857
They found Mitch.

01:23:03.984 --> 01:23:07.696
He got... he got shot
in the head, baby.

01:23:09.573 --> 01:23:11.325
He's dead.

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:13.076

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.954
He's dead!

01:23:33.722 --> 01:23:35.349
Fuck!

01:24:20.435 --> 01:24:23.689
All I had left of Mitch
was his voice in my head

01:24:23.772 --> 01:24:27.401
saying that he was gonna meet up
with Rico that night.

01:24:37.494 --> 01:24:39.121

01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:52.634
so I can get this ransom money
for Sonny, man.

01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:54.261
You got 14 bricks
right there?

01:24:54.344 --> 01:24:55.596
Yeah.

01:24:55.637 --> 01:24:57.181
Who'd you off... A.?

01:24:57.264 --> 01:24:58.932
Yeah, man, but look, B.

01:24:59.016 --> 01:25:00.976

01:25:02.311 --> 01:25:03.812
We right the fuck back on
once I get Sonny.

01:25:03.854 --> 01:25:05.439
It's gonna be business...

01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:08.650
What the fuck?

01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:49.024
Hey, yo, A.

01:25:49.066 --> 01:25:51.151

01:25:53.195 --> 01:25:55.155
You a'ight, B.?

01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:57.950
No, man. Fucked up.

01:25:58.033 --> 01:26:02.538
You know I'm fucked up
over this shit, too, B.

01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:05.624
I murdered them niggas
who did that shit to Mitch, B.

01:26:05.707 --> 01:26:07.042
I'm trying to find out.

01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:09.253
I haven't found
any of the damn keys

01:26:09.336 --> 01:26:10.838
in that building with Mitch.

01:26:10.921 --> 01:26:12.131
Keys?

01:26:12.214 --> 01:26:15.050
Yeah, I gave Mitch a set of keys
to get Sonny back, man.

01:26:15.134 --> 01:26:17.886
I know he had the fuckin' keys
in there with him, man.

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.764
Now, you know, I got to get
the money or the keys, man,

01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:22.391
to pay this connect back with.

01:26:25.227 --> 01:26:28.522
Hey, yo, B., why you ain't
callin' me on that shit, B.?

01:26:30.899 --> 01:26:32.818
You know I would have went
with that nigga Mitch

01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:34.319
and made that shit happen
for you.

01:26:34.403 --> 01:26:36.238
I know, I know, man.
That's on me. I fucked up.

01:26:38.615 --> 01:26:40.576
You talk to Mitch yesterday?

01:26:40.617 --> 01:26:43.579
I ain't talked to Mitch
or see that nigga

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.081
the whole goddamn day
yesterday, B.

01:26:51.879 --> 01:26:53.881
What happened to your face,
man?

01:26:53.964 --> 01:26:55.507
What?

01:26:55.591 --> 01:26:57.342
I said, "What happened
to your face?"

01:26:59.261 --> 01:27:00.512
This shit?

01:27:00.596 --> 01:27:03.265
I was fuckin' with this
wild-ass bitch last night.

01:27:03.307 --> 01:27:04.725
You know how I play, B.

01:27:04.808 --> 01:27:06.935
That's wild, boy.
You a wild motherfucker, man.

01:27:07.019 --> 01:27:08.729
Yeah.
-You videotape that shit?

01:27:10.939 --> 01:27:12.399
You think you know me
and shit, man.

01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:14.067
I ain't tape that shit
last night, B.

01:27:22.784 --> 01:27:26.497
I kept another set of keys,
understand?

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:29.583
To sell for when the ransom
was paid.

01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.585
Now, look,
the way shit is now, man,

01:27:31.668 --> 01:27:33.337
it's too hot
out on the streets

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.088
for me to be caught
with myself

01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:37.466
trying to go out there
and conduct something.

01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:39.384
I'm gonna need you
to do me this.

01:27:39.468 --> 01:27:41.470
I want you to sell these keys
for me.

01:27:41.553 --> 01:27:43.764
Give me the money,
I can pay it to the connect.

01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:45.432
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:27:45.474 --> 01:27:48.477
Then I take you in there,
introduce you to the connect.

01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:50.687
So you want me to sell
all the keys?

01:27:50.771 --> 01:27:53.232
Yeah. It's like this.

01:27:53.315 --> 01:27:56.401
I been talking to these kids
from out of town

01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:59.404
who say, you know,
they'd take these keys

01:28:00.739 --> 01:28:03.158
Buy them at a higher price
than what's goin'.

01:28:05.244 --> 01:28:07.162
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

01:28:07.246 --> 01:28:09.623
So, you know, all you got to do
is sell them.

01:28:09.706 --> 01:28:11.959
Then you take the extra cheese
off the top.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.752
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

01:28:13.836 --> 01:28:16.255
Then I can walk away.
We all can walk away set.

01:28:16.338 --> 01:28:18.799
And you're cool with that?

01:28:20.008 --> 01:28:23.679
I'm cool.
I'm cool with that.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.014
I don't believe you, A.

01:28:26.098 --> 01:28:29.476
I mean, you gonna give up
all this shit?

01:28:32.563 --> 01:28:34.648
About how much?

01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:36.733
Yeah, nigga.
I said I was going.

01:28:36.817 --> 01:28:38.277
I wanted out.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.946
Oh, no. I'm gonna need more
than that for sure.

01:28:41.029 --> 01:28:45.492
I wasn't playin' when
I said that. You understand?

01:28:45.534 --> 01:28:47.035
What's up, man? A'ight?

01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:48.162
A'ight.
-Good.

01:28:48.203 --> 01:28:49.830
Let's go up here.
After you.

01:28:52.249 --> 01:28:54.376
You're crazy, B.

01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:56.503
Nigga fucking giving up.

01:28:56.587 --> 01:28:57.880
I love you, B.

01:28:57.963 --> 01:29:01.884
Put it down!

01:29:01.925 --> 01:29:04.428
Fucking gonna give up
all this shit, man.

01:29:06.555 --> 01:29:08.182
Freeze!
Put your hands up!

01:29:08.265 --> 01:29:10.559
You a'ight?
-No. I'm fucked up, man.

01:29:10.642 --> 01:29:11.852
Drop the bag!

01:29:11.935 --> 01:29:13.228
Drop the bag!

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:16.356
Anything you need,
let me know, man.

01:29:16.398 --> 01:29:18.567
Down!
-We need an ambulance here.

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:21.361
You lookin' to play no ball,
baby?

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:25.866
Yo, A., call me, B.

01:29:25.908 --> 01:29:27.117
Call me, B.

01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:28.660
A'ight?

01:29:43.091 --> 01:29:46.011
Yeah, I called him.

01:29:46.762 --> 01:29:48.138
And I gave him the number
of fake-ass deals

01:29:48.388 --> 01:29:51.058
who turned out to be the feds.

01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:55.896
See, I knew Rico's greed
would destroy him

01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:57.856
and set me free.

01:30:01.485 --> 01:30:05.072
I'm sure that he would say
I went out like a punk.

01:30:05.155 --> 01:30:07.449
But fuck it.

01:30:07.533 --> 01:30:08.909
It's a price I could live with.

01:30:08.951 --> 01:30:10.994
I don't like the motherfucker
anyway. I did it.

01:30:11.078 --> 01:30:12.663
But 25 to life

01:30:12.746 --> 01:30:13.956
I did that.

01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:16.083
Rico can't live with that.

01:30:16.166 --> 01:30:18.168
I ain't snitchin' on nobody
from Harlem, man.

01:30:18.252 --> 01:30:20.420
I'll give you a couple cats
down in D.C.

01:30:20.462 --> 01:30:22.589
doing they thing out of town,
doing they thing,

01:30:22.631 --> 01:30:25.384
but, um, I'm not snitchin'
on nobody in Harlem

01:30:25.467 --> 01:30:30.264
'cause when I come home,
I'm still gonna be the king.

01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:36.270
Meanwhile,
Janet sat by the phone,

01:30:36.311 --> 01:30:38.188
but no more calls came.

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.154
Mitch had it right about lce.

01:30:45.195 --> 01:30:49.158
His uncle was the one
not looking out for family.

01:30:49.241 --> 01:30:51.410
His bitterness
towards his nephew Mitch

01:30:51.493 --> 01:30:53.745
was taken out
on his other nephew Sonny...

01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:55.747
his own blood.

01:30:55.831 --> 01:30:57.249
Stand back.

01:30:57.332 --> 01:31:00.002
Tommy did lce's dirty work.

01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:03.797
When the ransom money
didn't come,

01:31:03.839 --> 01:31:05.507
he killed Sonny.

01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:08.343
The game was over.

01:31:08.385 --> 01:31:09.928
All right,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:31:33.076 --> 01:31:34.870
Now there's a new game.

01:31:34.953 --> 01:31:37.581
Us old players are gone.

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:40.542
But you can see our story
on music videos

01:31:40.584 --> 01:31:43.879
with prop guns
and fake champagne.

01:31:43.962 --> 01:31:46.340
I guess you don't have to be
somebody no more.

01:31:46.381 --> 01:31:49.843
I guess you can just front
like you somebody you ain't.

01:31:53.555 --> 01:31:55.098
I have a family.

01:31:55.182 --> 01:31:59.353
Lulu's bag of diamonds made
a down payment on a new life.

01:32:06.318 --> 01:32:08.529
As my man Mitch would say

01:32:08.612 --> 01:32:10.239
"Life is good."

01:32:12.699 --> 01:32:14.868
Maybe I will be
the George Jefferson

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:16.745
of the neighborhood.

01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:24.670
I'll get back to you on that.

01:32:24.753 --> 01:32:27.256
Like "What?"
Looking down here like...

01:32:27.339 --> 01:32:30.259
Iook at the world like
down here like "What?"

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.218
Money, money.
