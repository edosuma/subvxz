they bring you up

17:36.622 --> 17:38.557

for you, Alyson,

what pile have you thrown

32:34.018 --> 32:35.720

Good choice.
Thank you.

all the picture cards

all the black ones
in the other.

to continue playing.

behind their magic,

we thought we will close
every show

37:52.269 --> 37:53.737
with a Penn and Teller trick.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.340
That would be a great idea,
and we had a lot of materials.

37:56.373 --> 37:59.543
We did live shows, so we pulled
stuff out of the live show,

37:59.577 --> 38:01.512

at the end of the TV show.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.047

But we never thought it would
run more than two seasons.

So now we've done nine seasons,
over 100 of these closers,

We just need to come up

38:19.730 --> 38:22.166
So one technique we use
is to go to old tricks,

38:22.199 --> 38:24.501
not other people's,
but public domain,

38:24.534 --> 38:27.137
and try to do a Penn
and Teller version of those.

38:27.170 --> 38:28.806
So here's the trick.
We're gonna show you

38:28.838 --> 38:30.173
exactly how it's done.

38:30.206 --> 38:32.043
But first, we'll show you
what the trick is.

38:32.076 --> 38:34.744
It is the doughnut
on the ribbon trick.

38:34.778 --> 38:37.047
So go to your friend,
and you have them thread

38:37.081 --> 38:40.483
a doughnut onto a ribbon
and tell them to hold

38:40.518 --> 38:43.487
both ends of the ribbons
and never let go.

38:43.521 --> 38:46.724
Then you explain
that doughnuts have integrity,

38:46.757 --> 38:50.293
not just morally and ethically,
but also structurally.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.197
So if you rip a doughnut apart
to get it off the ribbon,

38:53.230 --> 38:54.965
you could not
put it back together.

38:54.998 --> 38:56.534
Then you show them a miracle.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.902
You put a napkin
over the doughnut,

38:58.936 --> 39:01.505
reach under, say magic words,
if you want,

39:01.539 --> 39:06.443

with complete integrity.

39:08.244 --> 39:10.213

a perfect doughnut

39:12.583 --> 39:14.085

39:14.117 --> 39:17.021
That is a miracle.

39:17.054 --> 39:21.324
Now, you can do that--you can
do that trick at home

39:21.358 --> 39:22.992
'cause we're going
to show you the secret.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.661
Now, here's the secret.

39:24.695 --> 39:27.998
You take the doughnut and you
have your friend thread it on.

39:28.798 --> 39:31.369
And then while you're
talking about them holding it

39:31.402 --> 39:33.204
and the integrity
of the doughnut,

39:33.237 --> 39:36.873
you sneak in another doughnut,
a duplicate.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.309
You hook it over
your little finger,

39:38.342 --> 39:41.077
and we'll show you
what you do without the napkin.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.813
With a napkin covering it,
you reach out

39:42.847 --> 39:45.181
and you really do rip
the doughnut apart.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.219
You show your friend
the duplicate,

39:48.251 --> 39:53.289
and meanwhile, you just eat
the evidence, just like that.

39:53.324 --> 39:54.657
So here's the trick you can do,

39:54.692 --> 39:56.427
but that's not
a Penn and Teller trick.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.528
That's not big enough for TV.

39:58.561 --> 40:01.565
We have to make it bigger
and more Penn and Teller.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.233
So this shape is a torus.

40:03.266 --> 40:04.969
The shape here,
like a doughnut.

40:05.001 --> 40:07.271
So we thought, what else has--
there you go, Georgie.

40:07.304 --> 40:08.639
It's a little sticky.
Be careful.

40:08.672 --> 40:10.474
What else has that shape?

40:10.507 --> 40:12.710
And the answer came back:
a tire.

40:12.742 --> 40:15.579
And a tire also
has the integrity

40:15.612 --> 40:19.048
because if you break the tire,
you can't put it back together.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.251
It pops.

40:20.284 --> 40:21.385
So here's the Penn
and Teller version.

40:21.418 --> 40:22.619
Come on out, Georgie.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.021
Here's the Penn
and Teller version.

40:24.054 --> 40:25.822
It's not a doughnut on a
ribbon.

40:25.856 --> 40:29.059
It is a tire on a rope.

40:29.092 --> 40:31.762
So you've got a solid rope,
just like the ribbon.

40:31.795 --> 40:36.400
And then Teller comes out
with the exact same napkin.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.001
Okay.
Now, you at watching home,

40:38.034 --> 40:40.103

same exact way of doing it.

Forget about
the doughnut trick.

and utterly intact.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.795
So forget
about the doughnut trick.

This is a brand--this is
a brand-new trick,

41:07.597 --> 41:11.202

41:13.570 --> 41:15.672
- Oh, no.
Don't eat that.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.173
- It's good.
It's good eating.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.777

and Penn looks tired.

good night from Las Vegas,
