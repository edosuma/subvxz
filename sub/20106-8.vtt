00:29.081 --> 00:30.314
So, uh...

00:30.316 --> 00:32.783
Shut up, everybody!

00:32.267 --> 00:34.301
And what do you mean,
Mother killed Woodhouse?

00:35.736 --> 00:36.937
Me?
- Yes, you!

00:36.939 --> 00:38.004
Yeah.
- Duh.

00:38.006 --> 00:40.640
Well, not, you know,
not her personally,

00:40.642 --> 00:42.909
it was probably
that golem of hers.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.284
Mr. Zerk.

00:51.286 --> 00:54.354
It's obvious that Archer's
bungled this whole thing,

00:54.356 --> 00:58.358
which means we need to do
a little... housekeeping.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.759
Rgh?
- Mm-hmm.

00:59.761 --> 01:03.330
And don't bring back
a dirty shovel.

01:03.332 --> 01:04.364
Rrrgh...

01:07.135 --> 01:10.136
Oh, my god, if someone
doesn't bring me toast

01:10.138 --> 01:13.773
I will literally die.

01:13.775 --> 01:15.375
And how do you know about this?

01:15.377 --> 01:17.377
Oh, come on, everybody knows.

01:17.379 --> 01:19.179
Your partner got in too deep
on his dope bill,

01:19.181 --> 01:20.780
so she had that ape whack him.

01:20.782 --> 01:22.382
If I find out
you're lying to me...

01:22.384 --> 01:24.117
Why would I lie?

01:24.119 --> 01:25.385
That bitch...

01:25.387 --> 01:27.053
Well, you know what they say,

01:27.055 --> 01:29.656
you lie down with dogs,
you wake up with fl...

01:29.658 --> 01:31.124
Jesus!

01:31.126 --> 01:33.827
What! What's the big idea?

01:33.829 --> 01:36.062
The big idea is
we're going to Dreamland,

01:36.064 --> 01:37.330
and you're all
gonna stay tied up

01:37.332 --> 01:39.165
until I find out the truth.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.034
Who keeps this much rope
in their trunk?

01:41.036 --> 01:42.235
Besides rapists?

01:42.237 --> 01:44.004
Uh, mountain climbers?

01:44.006 --> 01:46.506
Yeah, climbing up to their
mountaintop rape-shed.

01:46.508 --> 01:48.241
Their what?
How would that even work?

01:48.243 --> 01:50.477
Are the victims already
up there, or...

01:50.479 --> 01:52.746
And the next person who talks...

01:52.748 --> 01:55.849
Son of a... 
- What?

01:55.851 --> 01:58.652
No, I was... gonna say
rope salesmen.

01:58.654 --> 02:00.453
Oh, god!

02:02.223 --> 02:04.257
Anybody have a joke about socks?

02:04.259 --> 02:06.927
No? Okay, I got one.

02:06.929 --> 02:10.096
Um, "sock sock."

02:10.098 --> 02:12.832
And then you say "who's there?"

02:12.834 --> 02:15.101
Okay, then, I guess just pout.

02:18.205 --> 02:23.410
I-I don't understand.
Are you a cop?

02:23.412 --> 02:26.513
Uh, do I look like a cop?

02:26.515 --> 02:28.214
N-no...
and yet!

02:28.216 --> 02:31.284
I'm commandeering this vehicle!

02:40.194 --> 02:44.030
So listen... uh, I don't wanna
tell you how to live your life,

02:44.032 --> 02:46.433
but if I were you, I'd just
go ahead and jump out.

02:48.437 --> 02:50.870
And I'd do it sooner
rather than...

02:52.407 --> 02:53.974
later!

03:38.575 --> 03:42.878
Double double,
toil and trouble...

03:42.880 --> 03:45.181
Although if I'm being honest,

03:45.183 --> 03:47.717
it's really no trouble.
I love my work.

03:47.719 --> 03:51.187
Not as much as you do,
obviously.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.222
Alright, once my patient
arrives...

03:53.224 --> 03:55.558
Well, speak of the devil.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.893
I was just... oh, damn it,
what do you want?

03:57.895 --> 03:59.128
Rrrrgh!

03:59.130 --> 04:00.429
What?

04:00.431 --> 04:01.631
Rgh.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.733
Well, don't bring it back dirty.
Rrgh!

04:07.138 --> 04:08.571
Because it ruins it.

04:08.573 --> 04:09.972
<i>Now sit down!</i>

04:09.974 --> 04:13.142
Come on, I don't have
all goddamn day!

04:13.144 --> 04:14.377
I mean I do, but...

04:14.379 --> 04:17.546
mm mmmf! Mmf mmfff mmf!

04:17.548 --> 04:21.117
- What?
- mmff! Mmf mmf! Rrmmfmf!

04:21.119 --> 04:23.119
I can't understand a word
you're saying.

04:23.121 --> 04:25.221
Mm mmmf! Mmf mmfff mmf!

04:25.223 --> 04:26.689
Oh, my god.

04:28.992 --> 04:31.127
What?
pfft, pfft.

04:31.129 --> 04:33.496
I don't know, I didn't really
have anything, I was just...

04:33.498 --> 04:35.298
mmf mmmf!
Mmf mmmf!

04:37.001 --> 04:39.068
Pfft, pfft! Ptuh! Pbbb!
There! Happy?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.236
What the hell

04:40.238 --> 04:41.404
is going on here?

04:41.406 --> 04:44.073
Aha!
aha what?

04:44.075 --> 04:46.609
Aha, um, hang on...

04:46.611 --> 04:48.911
Trexler?
Why the hell are you here?

04:48.913 --> 04:52.114
I... aha! okay, I got it now.
Sit down.

04:52.116 --> 04:53.082
I beg your pardon?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.351
Sit down!

04:55.353 --> 04:57.853
Well, somebody likes to chew
his cabbage twice...

04:57.855 --> 05:00.623
Both of you!
All right!

05:00.625 --> 05:03.259
Rudolph
the rude-nosed reindeer...

05:03.261 --> 05:04.960
Now then, would you mind
telling me

05:04.962 --> 05:06.862
what it is you think
you're doing?

05:06.864 --> 05:10.266
I think it might be some kinda
Hercule Poirot-type deal,

05:10.268 --> 05:12.301
where he gathers everybody
in the parlor.

05:12.303 --> 05:15.204
Have you lost your mind?

05:15.206 --> 05:18.140
Actually maybe, I dunno,
I haven't slept in like a week

05:18.142 --> 05:20.776
and I've been eating Dexedrine
like candy, so...

05:20.778 --> 05:22.511
are you seeing tracers yet?

05:22.513 --> 05:25.047
I... no, shut up.
What is this all about?

05:25.049 --> 05:27.383
It's about you,
killing my partner!

05:27.385 --> 05:29.552
What? who told you that?

05:29.554 --> 05:32.688
Trexler!
wh... Trexler, you dirty liar!

05:32.690 --> 05:35.691
Well, now, technically I said
your goon killed him, but...

05:35.693 --> 05:37.293
we had nothing to do with it!

05:37.295 --> 05:39.628
Oh, and I'm just supposed
to take your word?

05:39.630 --> 05:41.297
You took his!
Well?

05:41.299 --> 05:44.900
Why would I have him killed?
Because he owed you money!

05:44.902 --> 05:47.737
Okay, well think
about that statement.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.505
Strangely illogical.
Yeah.

05:49.507 --> 05:50.673
It's not like
he was walking around

05:50.675 --> 05:51.741
with the money in his belly.

05:51.743 --> 05:53.409
Then why'd you send me
down to long beach

05:53.411 --> 05:55.177
the night my office was robbed?

05:55.179 --> 05:56.812
Burgled.
whatevered!

05:56.814 --> 06:00.216
To spy on Trexler!
We're competitors! I...

06:00.218 --> 06:01.751
which is why, you idiot,
he's trying

06:01.753 --> 06:05.654
to frame me for killing your partner!
- Slander!

06:05.656 --> 06:07.156
Sue me!
- I got a half a mind to!

06:07.158 --> 06:09.825
You've got half a mind, period.
- And all the burns.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.193
And if I could, I'd sue you

06:11.195 --> 06:12.995
for hijacking my truckload
of whores!

06:12.997 --> 06:15.731
That wasn't me, either!
Yeah, Poovey took 'em.

06:15.733 --> 06:16.899
Godddammit.
what?

06:16.901 --> 06:19.535
Yeah, what?
Oh, don't play dumb, Figgis!

06:19.537 --> 06:21.537
I'm not! I had no idea!

06:21.539 --> 06:24.373
Or did he?
Oh, you son of a bitch!

06:24.375 --> 06:26.342
Why ya throwin' me
under the bus?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.211
I am gonna go buy a bus, and
literally throw you under it,

06:29.213 --> 06:31.347
and then drive it back
and forth on your face!

06:31.349 --> 06:33.749
See?
spoken like a true killer!

06:33.751 --> 06:37.086
Oh, like you're one to talk!
I got three men in the morgue!

06:37.088 --> 06:39.255
Again, that was Poovey.

06:39.257 --> 06:41.724
What? goddammit! I mean...

06:41.726 --> 06:44.360
Well, some people
need to get shot!

06:44.362 --> 06:46.595
Case in point!
- Rrgh?

06:50.867 --> 06:55.304
Whoo! Hey, gang!

07:01.439 --> 07:03.506
What's happening?

07:03.508 --> 07:07.406
Are you kidding me? How are you here?
- Commandeered a vehicle.

07:07.408 --> 07:09.275
I mean how are you still alive?

07:09.277 --> 07:11.510
I dunno,
I guess just clean livin'!

07:11.512 --> 07:13.479
A-and how did you know
we were here?

07:13.481 --> 07:15.314
I didn't! No, no, this is just

07:15.316 --> 07:18.350
an almost
unbelievable coincidence.

07:18.352 --> 07:20.419
No, I'm actually just here
for my blue stuff.

07:20.421 --> 07:22.087
Your what?
- Um...

07:22.089 --> 07:24.623
So this is a little awkward.

07:24.625 --> 07:28.661
But he's actually my patient.

07:28.663 --> 07:31.197
I don't care what he is...
he's a goddamn robot!

07:31.199 --> 07:33.933
Actually...
nobody smashes up my club!

07:35.436 --> 07:36.535
Mr. Zerk!

07:36.537 --> 07:37.703
Grrrrghh...

07:37.705 --> 07:41.140
Okay, but we gotta
make this quick...

07:41.142 --> 07:42.208
Rarrrghh!

07:44.145 --> 07:45.611
'Cause I'm about a quart low.

07:45.613 --> 07:46.679
A quart low on what?

07:46.681 --> 07:48.814
This! he has to have it to live!

07:48.816 --> 07:51.517
Yeah, so come on, doc,
fill 'er up.

07:51.519 --> 07:53.452
Will somebody...
Archer, shoot him!

07:53.454 --> 07:55.888
What? no, he's my life's work!
Yeah.

07:55.890 --> 07:58.791
Plus it doesn't do any good.
Look.

07:58.793 --> 08:00.292
Owww!

08:00.294 --> 08:02.328
Dammit, Archer!
You did that on purpose!

08:02.330 --> 08:03.963
- Come on.
- Seriously?

08:03.965 --> 08:06.065
What're you doing?
- Gettin' the hell outta here.

08:06.067 --> 08:09.335
Wh...? No, you're not!
- Well, ya say that...

08:09.337 --> 08:10.803
Come on, man, jam it in there

08:10.805 --> 08:12.638
so I can start killing
these shitheads.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.474
What?
No, no, that's not what I...

08:15.476 --> 08:16.909
Jam it!
- No!

08:16.911 --> 08:20.813
I won't have you become just another
mindless killing machine!

08:20.815 --> 08:23.983
How, could you possibly think
you're the boss of me?

08:23.985 --> 08:26.652
I'll show ya who's boss!

08:26.654 --> 08:29.255
How ya like that?

08:29.257 --> 08:32.357
Meh.
- Well, then how about this!

08:32.360 --> 08:34.559
- Oof!
- Woooooo!

08:34.562 --> 08:36.061
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on...

08:36.063 --> 08:38.063
I'm going as fast as I can!

08:38.065 --> 08:39.999
What about me?
- What about you?

08:40.001 --> 08:41.533
Get me outta here
alive, all right?

08:41.534 --> 08:44.169
And the ransom money,
we'll call it even. - Yeah.

08:44.171 --> 08:46.505
That's what you told Archer.
And look what good it did him!

08:46.507 --> 08:48.908
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
- Rrrraagghhh!

08:48.910 --> 08:52.711
Ungh! oh, my god,
that really hurt.

08:52.713 --> 08:56.548
Look at you, whining
like your little buddy.

08:56.550 --> 08:57.716
My what?

08:57.718 --> 08:59.585
Yeah, the little limey
dope-fiend.

08:59.587 --> 09:01.954
When I gut-shot him
and left him for dead.

09:01.956 --> 09:03.422
What?

09:03.424 --> 09:05.925
Aha! Probably
on Trexler's orders!

09:05.927 --> 09:07.259
What, no! I didn't...

09:07.261 --> 09:08.694
he didn't tell me to do it.

09:08.696 --> 09:09.929
Ow.

09:11.631 --> 09:13.365
I did it just to see
his light go out.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.600
Goddamn.

09:14.602 --> 09:15.868
Rrrraaaagh!

09:15.870 --> 09:16.902
Ungh!

09:16.904 --> 09:18.237
Torrent downloaded from rarbg

09:18.239 --> 09:19.905
plus he cut me off in traffic.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.107
You...
rrrnnnngh!

09:22.109 --> 09:24.043
I'm sorry, what was that?
Grrnk!

09:24.045 --> 09:26.378
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of your Adam's apple

09:26.380 --> 09:28.247
grinding against your spine.

09:28.249 --> 09:30.616
Grrnk...
no, still nothin'.

09:30.618 --> 09:32.151
Hurry up!

09:32.153 --> 09:33.786
Jesus, you people would stand

09:33.788 --> 09:35.554
in a bread line
and ask for toast.

09:35.556 --> 09:36.889
Wait, there's toast?

09:36.891 --> 09:38.657
What?
why would there be toast?

09:38.659 --> 09:40.793
- Why wouldn't there be?
- Stop it!

09:40.795 --> 09:43.762
Stop it! Don't you see?
You're better than this!

09:43.764 --> 09:45.764
You don't have to be a killer!

09:45.766 --> 09:48.467
You can use your power
for the good of all mankind!

09:48.469 --> 09:50.169
Yeah, I could.

09:50.171 --> 09:52.805
But I was a murderer before you
turned me into a freak,

09:52.807 --> 09:54.606
so, I don't know why you thought

09:54.608 --> 09:56.608
this was gonna have a happy ending.
But...

09:56.610 --> 09:58.677
Now go make me some blue stuff!

09:58.679 --> 10:01.013
Ngh!

10:01.015 --> 10:04.016
Is... is that your final answer?

10:04.018 --> 10:06.285
Not if I have
to come over there.

10:06.287 --> 10:08.954
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear that.

10:08.956 --> 10:09.989
Aktion!

10:11.759 --> 10:12.858
Oh, god!
What is that?

10:12.860 --> 10:14.426
What-what is that?

10:14.428 --> 10:15.861
Sweet Mother of god!

10:19.033 --> 10:20.966
Wait, what is this?

10:22.036 --> 10:24.670
Rrnk! goddamn... rrnk!

10:27.208 --> 10:31.043
Ugh. Now I don't even know
if I want toast.

10:31.045 --> 10:33.645
Aaghhh! No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait! Stop it! No!

10:33.647 --> 10:37.216
Holy shit. Glad I don't have
a flashback for that.

10:37.218 --> 10:41.353
Down! down! Down! Goddammit, do
these muttz even speak engl...

10:43.490 --> 10:45.391
God!
Jesus Christ!

10:45.393 --> 10:49.695
<i>Achtung! hunden! Aus! Aus!</i>

10:49.697 --> 10:53.132
Krieger?
- I don't... hunden!<I> Aus!

10:53.134 --> 10:55.034
Oh, for the...
rrrrgh!

11:00.141 --> 11:05.044
Why on earth would you do that?

11:05.423 --> 11:07.423
They were ruining toast!

11:14.950 --> 11:16.618
Somebody do something.

11:16.620 --> 11:19.254
Well, I already
threw a chair, so...

11:19.256 --> 11:23.224
Then you go do something!
- Archer, shoot them!

11:23.226 --> 11:24.826
No! They're all I have left!

11:24.828 --> 11:27.162
You don't count!

11:27.164 --> 11:29.397
Rrrrghh!

11:30.634 --> 11:31.866
Rrrrrrghh!

11:32.635 --> 11:34.636
<i>Aus! aus!</i>

11:34.638 --> 11:36.237
Rrrghh! grrghh!

11:37.908 --> 11:40.575
Man, I don't know
who to root against.

11:40.577 --> 11:41.976
They saved your life!

11:41.978 --> 11:43.344
Still though.

11:45.348 --> 11:47.549
Nooooo!

11:49.418 --> 11:52.954
Rrrghh! grrghh!

11:53.990 --> 11:55.523
Rrgh.

11:58.128 --> 12:02.330
You, you saved my life!

12:02.332 --> 12:03.798
Rrgh...

12:03.800 --> 12:07.969
And was it...
Was it because you love me?

12:07.971 --> 12:10.104
Rrrgh.
oh, my god.

12:10.106 --> 12:12.707
That is... without a doubt,

12:12.709 --> 12:15.777
the saddest thing I
have ever heard. Rgh?

12:15.779 --> 12:17.879
I mean, in what kind
of crazy dream-world

12:17.881 --> 12:20.315
could we ever possibly
be together?

12:22.886 --> 12:24.619
Jesus Christ.

12:24.621 --> 12:27.055
Should've shot her when I had the chance.
Okay, well,

12:27.057 --> 12:30.291
everything seems under control
here, so we'll just, um...

12:30.293 --> 12:32.193
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

12:32.195 --> 12:34.562
Yeah. with my money!
With my money!

12:34.564 --> 12:36.731
Well, thanks a lot, t-man!

12:36.733 --> 12:38.132
What?
drop the bag.

12:38.134 --> 12:39.801
What did you call her?

12:39.803 --> 12:41.736
T-man...
oh, hey, uh...

12:41.738 --> 12:43.571
but-but it's not what
you think... hey!

12:43.573 --> 12:45.573
It-it means treasury agent...
hey!

12:45.575 --> 12:48.810
Oh. Although right about now I'm
guessing she wishes it didn't.

12:48.812 --> 12:51.212
Son of a...
- Treasury agent?

12:51.214 --> 12:52.914
Look...
no, you look!

12:54.017 --> 12:55.350
Hey, be careful, it's got a...

12:55.352 --> 12:56.251
Zip it!
- I...

12:56.253 --> 12:57.819
I can explain!
- Yes.

12:57.821 --> 12:59.220
Please explain
what you've been doing

12:59.222 --> 13:01.055
in my bar for the past year.

13:01.057 --> 13:04.092
Because either you were
moonlighting as a singer

13:04.094 --> 13:06.394
just to make ends meet
on a government salary,

13:06.396 --> 13:09.163
or you were working undercover
to bring me down!

13:09.165 --> 13:11.532
Or both!
Dun-dun-dun!

13:11.534 --> 13:14.769
Not helping!
- But if I were undercover,

13:14.771 --> 13:17.238
obviously my agency would
be in the know,

13:17.240 --> 13:20.208
and so if anything
happened to me, you'd...

13:21.945 --> 13:24.412
Lana! What the shit, Mother?

13:24.414 --> 13:27.715
I, I didn't mean to! This damn
thing's got a hair trigger!

13:27.717 --> 13:30.051
That's what I was trying
to tell you! When?

13:30.053 --> 13:30.952
Before!

13:30.954 --> 13:32.787
Hair trigger my ass, gimme that!

13:32.789 --> 13:34.289
Oh, shit!

13:34.291 --> 13:36.224
Lana!

13:36.226 --> 13:37.859
Man, that is a hair trigger.

13:37.861 --> 13:39.227
Goddammit, Poovey!

13:39.229 --> 13:40.461
How was that my fault?

13:40.463 --> 13:43.631
La-Lana!
- Archer?

13:43.633 --> 13:45.967
Shhh. you're gonna be okay.

13:45.969 --> 13:48.102
Somebody call an ambulance!

13:48.104 --> 13:50.738
Ugh. I already threw a chair.

13:50.740 --> 13:53.541
Archer...

13:53.543 --> 13:54.709
I'm sorry.

13:54.711 --> 13:57.178
Why-why-why are you sorry?

13:58.213 --> 14:00.415
I got blood on you.

14:00.417 --> 14:03.751
Well, I blew a load
on your dress, so...

14:03.753 --> 14:05.753
Ungh!
Poovey!

14:05.755 --> 14:08.323
I'm sorry! I...
- Poovey!

14:08.325 --> 14:10.258
Goddammit! I...

14:10.260 --> 14:12.794
- Drop the goddamn gun!
- Okay!

14:17.733 --> 14:19.233
Is she...

14:19.235 --> 14:22.236
- Yes!
- whew!

14:22.238 --> 14:24.472
What? What? I was
asking if she's okay.

14:26.009 --> 14:30.745
No, Poovey, she is the exact
opposite of okay! She's dead!

14:30.747 --> 14:32.347
Because she got shot seven times

14:32.349 --> 14:35.083
and nobody could possibly
survive that!

14:35.085 --> 14:38.219
Not even in a parallel universe!

14:40.489 --> 14:42.423
What the hell
are you looking at?

14:42.425 --> 14:45.193
No, just...
Okay, so she's dead.

14:45.195 --> 14:48.963
Yes! she's dead!
Forever and ever!

14:48.965 --> 14:52.500
On infinite earths!

14:59.608 --> 15:03.678
Shut up!
And gimme that!

15:03.680 --> 15:04.946
Poovey, I'm giving you half.
- Of the money?

15:04.948 --> 15:06.047
Wait a minute!
- Are you nuts?

15:06.049 --> 15:07.348
But you have to promise to set

15:07.350 --> 15:09.217
those Chinese ladies
up in business.

15:09.219 --> 15:11.319
Oh, my god,
I've got so many ideas!

15:11.321 --> 15:12.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

15:12.522 --> 15:15.056
who says you get to decide
who gets the money?

15:15.058 --> 15:17.458
John Moses Browning.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.694
Well, news flash,
mister tough and smart guy,

15:19.696 --> 15:22.030
you're out of ammo!

15:25.167 --> 15:26.701
Wh... get him!

15:28.237 --> 15:29.771
Duh-huh.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.907
Goddammit.

15:32.909 --> 15:34.242
What?
What is it?

15:34.244 --> 15:35.643
There's no money.

15:35.645 --> 15:40.381
Just these weird German nudie
mags about sports and...

15:40.383 --> 15:43.151
Implied incest.
- There's no incest!

15:43.153 --> 15:45.686
They're all just
really happy to be together,

15:45.688 --> 15:47.488
- and outside, and...
- Naked.

15:47.490 --> 15:50.058
Well, and healthy. As a family.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.560
Whatever.
Now is not the time.

15:52.562 --> 15:55.496
Oh, right.
Sorry, father. Please continue.

15:55.498 --> 15:58.232
And do you, Cecil,

15:58.234 --> 16:01.769
take Trinette to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

16:01.771 --> 16:03.337
Mmmmmm...

16:03.339 --> 16:05.440
Ow! I do!

16:07.510 --> 16:12.013
So, I guess I'll see you around.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.600
And so that's pretty much that,
I guess. Vengeance-wise.

16:32.602 --> 16:35.303
And I, I don't know
if you feel avenged,

16:35.305 --> 16:37.405
or if that even matters to you.

16:37.407 --> 16:41.709
Tell you what I do know,
is robot dogs? Jesus Christ.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.615
And I know the case took a long
time, but like you always said,

16:47.617 --> 16:49.617
I have a tendency to get
sidetracked.

16:49.619 --> 16:52.220
Which, honestly,
was kinda shitty of you.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.124
And the smart thing would've
been to read your envelope

16:56.126 --> 17:00.628
full of clues and then start
rampaging, but... holy shit,

17:00.630 --> 17:02.296
I wonder if that was your will.

17:03.932 --> 17:06.134
Although I can't imagine
you having anything

17:06.136 --> 17:07.734
that I would possibly want.

17:07.737 --> 17:09.737
I mean, I'll swing
by your apartment

17:09.739 --> 17:11.806
and take a look
around, but uh...

17:13.775 --> 17:18.445
What else, what else?
Oh, I brought you some heroin.

17:18.448 --> 17:20.580
Hopefully some kids won't
walk by and eat it.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.184
Oh, and also, uh, a rock.

17:23.185 --> 17:24.652
I didn't know
if you were Jewish.

17:24.654 --> 17:25.920
We never talked about that.

17:25.922 --> 17:29.690
I guess mainly because you were
so weirdly private.

17:29.692 --> 17:32.760
But even so, Woodhouse.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.668
Oh, I'm gonna miss
the shit outta you.

17:40.670 --> 17:43.204
All right, I'll see ya.

17:43.206 --> 17:46.974
I dunno, next week, or...

17:46.976 --> 17:50.244
Uh, you know what,
let's play it by ear.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.035
What the...
Hello?

18:15.470 --> 18:17.138
Hello?

18:17.140 --> 18:19.640
Hey, where the hell
are you guys?

18:19.642 --> 18:24.545
Hello? hello?
Wait, what's this?

19:27.776 --> 19:32.747
Made in Georgia.
