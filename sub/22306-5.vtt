Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr,
and welcome to Drunk History.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.984
We bring you genuine stories
from history...

00:17.984 --> 00:20.353
They stole the thing.
That must be awful.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.255
Oh, my God, that's awful.

00:22.255 --> 00:25.325
...as told by blind-drunk
comedians.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.893
(laughs)

00:26.893 --> 00:30.463
The show lost all its money and
it'll have to blow the cab driver

00:30.463 --> 00:32.198
to get home.
I'm really sorry.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.967
Come on, we've all done it.

00:33.967 --> 00:37.270
I'm dancing at a party for
my own death. This is so fucked up.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.671
Shh!

00:38.671 --> 00:40.273
Result.
Hee-hee!

00:40.273 --> 00:41.908
I think I've got too drunk.

00:41.908 --> 00:45.078
I don't care any more.
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

00:56.489 --> 00:59.092
We begin tonight
with a trip back to the 1600s

00:59.092 --> 01:02.362
when Charles II was about
as popular as a fart in a lift.

01:02.362 --> 01:05.598
Here's the story of what happened
when he went on the run.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.800
(laughs)

01:06.800 --> 01:10.270
Russell Kane got wrecked
for this one, knocking back...

01:14.474 --> 01:16.576
Make your mind up, Russell.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.077
Welcome to my story.

01:19.012 --> 01:23.950
It's 1649, and up until that
there was one ruler, ordained by God.

01:23.950 --> 01:29.656
A man who was the ruler in God's
form, the monarch, King Charles I.

01:29.656 --> 01:30.824
# Ah! #

01:30.824 --> 01:33.526
However, people thought,
"That's not fair."

01:33.526 --> 01:35.228
"He's just a bloke like us."

01:35.228 --> 01:38.998
Maybe politicians should also...
could also rule.

01:38.998 --> 01:43.036
They thought, "Let's have a fight
about it," and we had a civil war.

01:43.036 --> 01:46.906
Cromwell was in charge. He was like,
"I'm the head of the Republicans

01:46.906 --> 01:51.344
and we should cut the king's head
off, just to show we mean business."

01:51.344 --> 01:54.347
The king was like,
"You don't need to cut my head off."

01:54.347 --> 01:58.084
But they cut his head off.
Bang! Off. That's it.

01:58.084 --> 02:01.087
We're no longer a country
run by a king.

02:01.087 --> 02:05.358
Imagine if you were Charles II,
the son of that mofo.

02:05.358 --> 02:10.463
Trust me, if Imodium exists,
you'd be doing a line of it.

02:11.764 --> 02:15.268
So Charles realises,
"I've got no choice."

02:15.268 --> 02:17.370
"I'm gonna have to go into hiding."

02:17.370 --> 02:18.771
"I can't go to England

02:18.771 --> 02:22.075
because that's where
Oliver Cromwell is hanging out."

02:22.075 --> 02:25.612
"I can't go to Scotland
because his army's blocking me."

02:25.612 --> 02:28.848
He thinks, "Fuck, I'm gonna go
back to the one place I know

02:28.848 --> 02:31.251
which is Boscobel Castle
in Worcester."

02:31.251 --> 02:33.887
The home of sauce.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.256
And he fucking digs in there,

02:36.256 --> 02:38.725
and there's a few brothers
hanging out there

02:38.725 --> 02:41.361
called the Pendrell brothers
who are Catholic.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.264
No-one knows how many there are,
or how it was spelt,

02:44.264 --> 02:47.133
so they were both religious
and thick.

02:47.133 --> 02:51.170
The Pendrell brothers say, "Look,
dude, you're so fucking king-like

02:51.170 --> 02:53.039
with your goatee and your hair."

02:53.039 --> 02:56.476
"We're gonna need to disguise you
properly like a peasant."

02:56.476 --> 02:59.012
But they can't find
any shoes that fit him,

02:59.012 --> 03:01.614
so they have to cut the edges off.

03:01.614 --> 03:04.284
And they give him
some greasy trousers,

03:04.284 --> 03:08.454
a shirt with the shoulders cut off.
Basically, he's an Australian.

03:09.255 --> 03:12.825
"Pass us those clippers then
and I'm gonna clipper off your hair

03:12.825 --> 03:14.827
so you've got a full mullet."

03:14.827 --> 03:18.998
"Is a mullet a type of fish
you would have before Christmas?"

03:18.998 --> 03:21.534
"No, it's like a haircut."

03:21.534 --> 03:24.304
They clipped his hair off.
"Thank you."

03:24.304 --> 03:27.407
But you have to do
a Brummie accent to sound like us.

03:27.407 --> 03:30.410
"I'm not the king of England,
I'm a fucking pisshead."

03:32.812 --> 03:37.317
So, Cromwell's army is after him
and he has to go hide in the forest.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.453
He can hear the army coming,
and King Charles II is like,

03:40.453 --> 03:44.424
"Shit, dude,
I need to hide in this tree."

03:44.424 --> 03:47.160
"I need to hear up here a long time,
you get me?"

03:47.160 --> 03:50.730
And it was the first finger click,
that's where it started.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.332
He did the first ever one.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.068
So, Cromwell's looking round
under the leaves,

03:55.068 --> 03:58.471
like, "The king's round here
somewhere but I can't see him."

03:58.471 --> 04:01.975
He didn't know the king was
above him, so they get away with it.

04:01.975 --> 04:07.447
And he's like, "What is the next best
pit-stop on the way to the coast?"

04:07.447 --> 04:09.515
"I know what I need, Lady Jane Lane."

04:09.515 --> 04:11.985
"I slung her a length
back in the day."

04:11.985 --> 04:14.187
"She's definitely gonna take me in."

04:15.054 --> 04:18.791
(laughs) Oh, my God, sorry.
I'm sorry.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.726
So he rocks up at Lady Jane Lane's,

04:20.726 --> 04:24.130
she's like, "Dude, I appreciate
the effort with the mullet,

04:24.130 --> 04:27.000
but I'm worried someone's
gonna recognise that."

04:27.000 --> 04:31.904
And I don't know what happens next...
because I'm pissed. (laughs)

04:31.904 --> 04:34.841
So, they hang out
at Lady Jane Lane's.

04:34.841 --> 04:37.543
She's like, "I've got an idea.
I've got a plan."

04:37.543 --> 04:41.714
"You pretend to be my servant
and we'll try and get to the coast."

04:41.714 --> 04:46.052
And he's like, "Well, yes.
So what do my duties involve?"

04:46.052 --> 04:49.956
And then did a wink to Lady Jane
Lane. She's like, "Don't push it."

04:51.491 --> 04:54.727
So, they're on their way to Dorset
with Lady Jane Lane.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.597
She's like, "You must keep up the act
at all times."

04:57.597 --> 04:59.732
He's like, "I will. I mean, I will."

04:59.732 --> 05:02.835
Then a couple of things happen
where he has to prove it.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.272
Anyway, fucking one of
the horse's shoes come off.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.675
He doesn't know what
he's fricking doing.

05:08.675 --> 05:12.545
The blacksmith is like, "Do you want
to come and help me with this?"

05:12.545 --> 05:15.682
"You are a peasant after all."
He's like, "I can't do it,

05:15.682 --> 05:20.520
because I'm so peasanty that
if I was to help with the shoe,

05:20.520 --> 05:22.922
my peasant brain
would instantly implode

05:22.922 --> 05:25.158
and I'd be reduced to
a sack of coal."

05:25.158 --> 05:28.394
You got to think of it,
if he drops his guard for a second,

05:28.394 --> 05:31.764
he's gonna take after his dad,
and his dad had no head.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.200
He was like, "I'm so poor."

05:34.200 --> 05:37.804
"I never even had a horse.
We used to ride round on a mouse."

05:37.804 --> 05:41.474
And he's like, "Oh, shit, man,
you're a total peasant."

05:41.474 --> 05:46.145
"Exactly. That's how poor I am."
And he blags it like that.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.915
(laughs)

05:48.915 --> 05:53.186
So, they're doing everything possible
to flee to the Dorset coast.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.723
And they hear this street party
in the distance.

05:56.723 --> 06:00.393
Charles is like, "I've had
a pretty fucking shit couple of days,

06:00.393 --> 06:01.994
I wouldn't mind partying."

06:01.994 --> 06:05.765
"Let's find out what they're
celebrating. Maybe we could join in."

06:05.765 --> 06:07.333
(music, laughter)

06:07.333 --> 06:11.204
Charles is like, "What's the party
about? It sounds really random."

06:11.204 --> 06:14.507
He's like, "The party is cos
Charles II has been killed."

06:14.507 --> 06:16.609
Charles II is like, "What the fuck?"

06:16.609 --> 06:20.279
"I'm dancing at a party for
my own death. This is so fucked up."

06:20.279 --> 06:22.281
"But in a way it's kind of ironic."

06:22.281 --> 06:24.650
"Oh, no,
irony's not been invented yet."

06:24.650 --> 06:26.486
And then he had a panic attack.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.990
(laughs)

06:31.958 --> 06:33.693
Sorry.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.430
Oh, no. (giggles)

06:41.067 --> 06:43.002
(exhales)

06:43.002 --> 06:44.837
So they finally get to the coast.

06:44.837 --> 06:48.074
Gotta be seven, eight weeks.
Cromwell's army is after him.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.810
Boatman's there,
"Want to go to France, do you?"

06:50.810 --> 06:53.346
"Good luck with that.
Busiest time of year."

06:53.346 --> 06:56.549
"Dude, I need a lift.
I mean, sorry, dude, I need a lift."

06:56.549 --> 06:58.684
I'm definitely a peasant.

06:58.684 --> 07:02.255
The boatman's like, "Fucking
you are not a peasant, mate."

07:02.255 --> 07:06.893
The ferryman's like, "It's gonna cost
about 80 quid, something like that."

07:06.893 --> 07:09.996
Whatever it is, it's the
equivalent of about 15 grand.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.732
Charles is like,
"OK, I think I can afford it."

07:12.732 --> 07:16.402
And then the ferryman's like,
"I think I recognise that face."

07:16.402 --> 07:19.872
"He looks like the dude who got
his head cut off, but younger."

07:19.872 --> 07:23.442
"That's Charles II." And then
bumped it up to fucking 200 quid.

07:23.442 --> 07:27.747
He charges him 40 grand in our money
just to go to France.

07:27.747 --> 07:30.082
He's like, "Yeah,
I'll totally pay that."

07:30.082 --> 07:34.287
Charles pays it of course
cos he's a... pussy!

07:34.287 --> 07:37.190
Cos Cromwell's like,
"We're gonna cut his head off."

07:37.190 --> 07:41.160
But the boat goes... and they
get away just in the nick of time.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.529
And Cromwell's waving Charles II off.

07:43.529 --> 07:46.365
"We'll cut your head off
as well, you bastard."

07:46.365 --> 07:49.735
Never mind, because now we're
a republic forever and ever.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.505
And they go to France
and he parties for ten years.

07:52.505 --> 07:57.009
Then Cromwell pegs it, and everyone's
like, "Who's next in charge?"

07:57.009 --> 07:59.946
And there was instantly
a constitutional crisis.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.547
King Charles II came back

08:01.547 --> 08:05.051
and he was like, "Do you recognise
the sheen of this, bitches?

08:05.051 --> 08:07.186
He was like, "I'll still be the king,

08:07.186 --> 08:10.323
but I acknowledge
Cromwell had a few points."

08:10.323 --> 08:12.992
"How about you have
some of the power,

08:12.992 --> 08:16.395
but we still have a king and
we still have a monarchy for show?

08:16.395 --> 08:18.965
And that's what's been in place
ever since,

08:18.965 --> 08:21.334
and that's why we are
the way we are today,

08:21.334 --> 08:24.103
with some unqualified tossers
ruling over us,

08:24.103 --> 08:27.840
while the rest of us peasants
scrabble round for whatever's left.

08:30.943 --> 08:34.113
I'll be honest, I'm not sure
if that's the drink talking

08:34.113 --> 08:37.049
or Russell's just like that.
That's it for part one.

08:37.049 --> 08:41.254
After the break, we go back to 1966,
the year England lost the World Cup.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.356
Yeah, you heard right.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.759
I don't know where your trophy is.
Oh, dear.

08:52.999 --> 08:56.936
Welcome back to Drunk History, where
comedians bring history to life

08:56.936 --> 08:59.005
while drinking themselves to death.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.973
Imagine if you were Charles II.

09:00.973 --> 09:05.144
Trust me, if Imodium exists,
you'd be doing in line of it.

09:07.446 --> 09:11.117
Next we've got a story which
combines football and drunkenness,

09:11.117 --> 09:14.921
but thankfully doesn't end up with
John Terry shagging your missus.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.958
Alex Horne drank seven beers,
two shots,

09:18.958 --> 09:21.761
and a bottle of wine
before telling us about it.

09:29.168 --> 09:32.872
Hello and welcome. My story today

09:32.872 --> 09:37.610
is a story set in the year 1966.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.846
The year in which England won...
Hang on a minute.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.750
...lost the World Cup.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.253
Lost? Exactly. Lost the World Cup.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.324
OK, so the World Cup is coming to
the UK and everyone's going crazy.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.427
For non-football lovers,
you're playing for a trophy,

09:54.427 --> 09:57.463
and the trophy itself
is called the Jules Rimet trophy.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.634
The head of the FA,
a guy called Joe Mears,

10:01.634 --> 10:06.005
said, "Let's let the people
see what the people can play for."

10:06.005 --> 10:09.041
And so they said, "Yes,
you can exhibit the trophy."

10:09.041 --> 10:13.446
And they were saying this to
not Sky, not BBC2,

10:13.446 --> 10:16.549
rather a stamp-collecting society.

10:16.549 --> 10:21.554
They're called...
Stanley Gibbons stamp...

10:21.554 --> 10:24.490
Stanley Gibbons
Stamp Collecting Society.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.894
OK? Pretty good so far.

10:28.894 --> 10:33.632
So the FA, in all their wisdom,
said, "All right, Stanley Gibbons,

10:33.632 --> 10:37.303
you normally look after stamps,
you can display...

10:38.771 --> 10:42.441
...er, football, the trophy.
The main world symbol of trophy."

10:42.441 --> 10:43.876
"Will it get stolen?"

10:43.876 --> 10:47.747
"No, no, no, no.
I'm normally in charge of stamps."

10:47.747 --> 10:50.282
"I think you can trust me
with the World Cup."

10:50.282 --> 10:53.853
And so they set up an exhibition
where there was the World Cup,

10:53.853 --> 10:56.455
the Jules Rimet World Cup,
and lots of stamps.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.958
Obviously this is a big deal
for the FA.

10:58.958 --> 11:03.162
The FA are thinking,
"OK, we need, er...

11:03.162 --> 11:05.331
...to protect the trophy."

11:05.331 --> 11:09.935
So they had security guys
guarding the trophy.

11:09.935 --> 11:13.105
And were fun-clothed security guards,

11:13.105 --> 11:16.909
like cricket gear and Hawaii?

11:18.210 --> 11:21.213
Clothes...
So they're all guarding the trophy.

11:21.213 --> 11:26.185
And then this is where the story
starts getting unbelievable.

11:26.185 --> 11:30.790
One day later, the trophy, gone. OK.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.592
And... OK, I'm gonna start again.

11:36.962 --> 11:41.534
So, how did the guy steal it?
Well, we're all fallible.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.103
The guard would have
probably been thinking,

11:44.103 --> 11:46.405
"I'm not gonna let anyone
steal that."

11:46.405 --> 11:48.808
Someone said,
"Did you have a nice pizza?"

11:48.808 --> 11:51.210
And he would have gone,
"Yes. Yes, I did."

11:51.210 --> 11:53.512
"So, normal. So, cheese and potato."

11:53.512 --> 11:56.615
"Whatever. Cheese and potato,
cheese and potato."

11:56.615 --> 11:58.851
And you come back and it's gone.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.887
Anyway, so the point was,
the trophy was missing

12:01.887 --> 12:05.191
and the FA were like, "Oh..."

12:06.492 --> 12:09.495
So it's a big deal.
So the head of the FA, Joe Mears,

12:09.495 --> 12:12.164
he was like, "Who do we call?"

12:12.164 --> 12:15.201
"Let's call up the Flying Squad."

12:15.201 --> 12:18.270
And this wasn't a stupid...
This was a genuine thing.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.606
"We'll call in the Flying Squad."

12:20.606 --> 12:23.109
The Flying Squad swooped in.

12:23.109 --> 12:27.113
"I am Charles Buggy. OK, I'm here."

12:27.113 --> 12:29.281
"Shh. I'll sort this out."

12:29.281 --> 12:33.285
(bottle clattering)

12:36.322 --> 12:39.725
So Charles Buggy came in and said,
"I'm gonna sort this out."

12:39.725 --> 12:44.797
And the Flying Squad turn up and
said, "Oh, no! They stole the thing."

12:44.797 --> 12:47.066
The guy said, "They stole the thing."

12:47.066 --> 12:50.169
And the head of the Flying Squad
said, "It must be awful."

12:50.169 --> 12:53.272
And the guy from the FA was going,
"Oh, God, it's awful."

12:53.272 --> 12:56.108
And the head... (laughs)

12:56.108 --> 12:57.443
Sorry.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.280
And the head of the Flying Squad
was going, "That must be awful."

13:01.280 --> 13:05.117
And the guy from the FA was going,
"Oh, my God, that's awful."

13:05.117 --> 13:07.520
So the point is it's was awful.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.190
This is genuinely a big story,
and I realise we're not doing it

13:11.190 --> 13:13.225
the service that it deserves.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.161
We are doing it disservice.

13:15.161 --> 13:19.832
So, Charles Buggy,
as he insisted on being called,

13:19.832 --> 13:22.935
was to interview the guards
and the witnesses.

13:25.237 --> 13:30.509
So Buggy looked at them and he said,
"OK, tell me, who did you see?"

13:30.509 --> 13:33.479
Somebody said,
"I saw a bloke with thin lips."

13:33.479 --> 13:36.515
One of them said,
"This guy, he's got ears."

13:36.515 --> 13:39.285
And another man said,
"I definitely saw a man."

13:39.285 --> 13:41.954
"A weird looking man
with hips up to his head."

13:41.954 --> 13:45.191
And another man said,
"Yeah, hips. Definitely hips."

13:45.191 --> 13:47.893
"Like, near...
Or lower than his head."

13:47.893 --> 13:50.429
This guy said,
"He was wearing a tunic."

13:50.429 --> 13:53.832
And the guy over this side said,
"I don't know what a tunic is,

13:53.832 --> 13:56.368
but like little shorts,
pantomime shorts."

13:56.368 --> 14:01.907
Somebody said, "I definitely
saw a man by the toilets who had a...

14:01.907 --> 14:03.909
...like an average height."

14:03.909 --> 14:05.711
But my favourite one, he said,

14:05.711 --> 14:09.548
"I saw someone who either had a scar
or didn't have a scar."

14:09.548 --> 14:12.318
Look,
I think I might have to be sick.

14:13.385 --> 14:14.987
OK? In a bit?

14:22.928 --> 14:27.566
And so, after literally
some time of interrogation,

14:27.566 --> 14:30.436
Buggy knew he was looking
for a man...

14:30.436 --> 14:32.838
He knew nothing more than that.

14:32.838 --> 14:36.208
But he knew someone was responsible
for the robbery.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.545
What happened next was,

14:39.545 --> 14:43.749
the police received a call
from a man calling himself Jackson.

14:43.749 --> 14:47.786
This is a fake name. So this is a guy
pretending to be Michael Jackson.

14:47.786 --> 14:50.256
He said, "Jackson,
it's Jackson here."

14:50.256 --> 14:54.226
"I've got your World Cup
and I want loads of money."

14:54.226 --> 14:58.163
"A million... Not a million.
I want £15,000."

14:58.163 --> 15:00.532
The police knew this guy
meant business,

15:00.532 --> 15:04.270
and so Buggy arranged to meet Jackson
on a London street,

15:04.270 --> 15:07.306
to exchange the trophy
with the money.

15:08.407 --> 15:12.478
Jackson turns up,
Buggy turns up with the money.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.747
They said, "Let's hand over."

15:14.747 --> 15:17.850
So Jackson says, "Are you sure
you're not a policeman?"

15:17.850 --> 15:20.653
The policeman says,
"Do I have a policeman's hat?"

15:20.653 --> 15:24.423
Jackson says "no". He goes, "Well,
exactly." He says, "Are you sure?"

15:24.423 --> 15:26.825
And the policeman goes,
"Ah... definite."

15:26.825 --> 15:30.195
"OK, give me the money
and I'll take you to the trophy."

15:30.195 --> 15:33.666
The policeman says,
"That sounds good, here's the money."

15:33.666 --> 15:36.035
Jackson says,
"Thank you for the money."

15:36.035 --> 15:39.204
And the policeman says,
"That was all part of the deal."

15:39.204 --> 15:40.506
"Hang on a minute!"

15:40.506 --> 15:43.442
And then Jackson spots some police
in the bush.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.445
He said, "They're not,"
and Jackson said, "They are."

15:46.445 --> 15:48.247
And he said, "Yeah, you got me."

15:48.247 --> 15:50.149
And he goes, "Argh, I'm running!"

15:50.149 --> 15:53.519
And he runs and the actual police
go and grab him.

15:53.519 --> 15:57.690
Turns out, it's not a big criminal.
It's a guy called Edward Bletchley.

15:57.690 --> 16:02.428
His previous criminal activity
is he nicked some, like, corned beef.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.764
They get him into the station
and ask him all the questions.

16:05.764 --> 16:10.536
"Where, how, who, why, and which?"

16:10.536 --> 16:13.072
And Bletchley said,
"I'm a middle-aged..."

16:13.072 --> 16:16.608
"Not middle-aged man.
The middle... the middleman."

16:16.608 --> 16:20.446
"I shouldn't be done for this.
I'm just some ordinary bloke."

16:20.446 --> 16:23.048
And, "I don't know where
your trophy is."

16:23.882 --> 16:26.885
And the police were like, "Oh, dear."

16:26.885 --> 16:32.558
Which means that the whereabouts of
the Jules Rimet trophy is a mystery.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.426
No-one knows where it is.

16:34.426 --> 16:40.466
And then it all changed
because a man, an ordinary man,

16:40.466 --> 16:43.736
was walking his dog.
And his dog's name is Pickles.

16:43.736 --> 16:48.640
When suddenly the doctor,
by which I mean dog,

16:48.640 --> 16:53.212
the dog, Pickles,
sniffs something under a bush.

16:53.212 --> 16:56.515
The owner says, "Put it down.
It's just a stick."

16:56.515 --> 16:59.084
Pickles says,
"But I've got the World Cup."

16:59.084 --> 17:03.088
"Pickles, either out of there
or we go home."

17:03.088 --> 17:06.625
But the dog persists,
and he goes, "No."

17:06.625 --> 17:09.528
So he comes out with the World Cup
in his teeth,

17:09.528 --> 17:12.731
and his owner goes, "Oh, wicked!"

17:12.731 --> 17:15.134
"It's not as big
as I thought it would be."

17:15.134 --> 17:18.771
But either way, he was excited,
and he said to the dog,

17:18.771 --> 17:21.573
"You are gonna give us
infamy... famey."

17:21.573 --> 17:23.275
"You're gonna give us fame."

17:23.275 --> 17:29.214
And so the outcome of the story
was that the dog became a hero.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.751
He stole... He found the World Cup.

17:32.751 --> 17:36.088
And he became a national hero.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.191
And then Bletchley was put in prison
for two years,

17:39.191 --> 17:41.593
and he said, "I apologise."

17:41.593 --> 17:43.162
And everyone said "OK".

17:43.162 --> 17:44.763
He said, "OK, I'm sorry."

17:44.763 --> 17:47.332
"I just hope that England
win the World Cup."

17:47.332 --> 17:50.869
And they won the World Cup,
and was there a World Cup to present?

17:50.869 --> 17:52.304
Yes, thanks to Pickles.

17:52.304 --> 17:55.674
So, England won the World Cup,
Pickles found the World Cup

17:55.674 --> 17:59.011
and we are grateful to them,

17:59.011 --> 18:02.347
and so thank you, Pickles.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.588
Ironically, Alex himself
was discovered under a bush

18:09.588 --> 18:11.123
later in the evening.

18:11.123 --> 18:14.126
Our final story tonight
is the legend of Lady Godiva

18:14.126 --> 18:15.928
and her blinding assets.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.198
Diane Morgan drank seven
gin and tonics and a few sambucas

18:19.198 --> 18:21.467
before revealing all.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.035
(belches)

18:23.035 --> 18:25.804
I'm going to tell you
about Lady Godiva

18:25.804 --> 18:29.775
and the most famous perv ever.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.851
(shudders)

18:38.851 --> 18:40.085
(coughs)

18:40.953 --> 18:42.554
It's the 11th Century.

18:42.554 --> 18:47.759
Lady Godiva is married to
a chap called Leofric,

18:47.759 --> 18:51.563
and he had started to levy
very heavy taxes

18:51.563 --> 18:54.166
on the people of Coventry.

18:54.166 --> 19:00.105
And Lady Godiva is quite loved,
so she goes to Leoflic... Leofric,

19:00.105 --> 19:03.675
and says, "I think these taxes,
they're a bit much."

19:03.675 --> 19:06.078
"They can't afford to eat and stuff."

19:06.078 --> 19:09.815
She's like, "Lift the taxes,
lift the taxes," day and night.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.718
And he says, "All right, fine."

19:12.718 --> 19:15.787
"If you ride naked
through the streets of the town,

19:15.787 --> 19:17.723
then I'll lift the taxes."

19:17.723 --> 19:20.425
Because he doesn't think
that she will do it.

19:20.425 --> 19:24.229
So she goes to
the people of Coventry.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.199
She probably had
some leaflets printed saying,

19:27.199 --> 19:29.635
"Stay indoors,
whatever you fucking do."

19:29.635 --> 19:32.971
She doesn't want anyone
to see her bits and pieces.

19:32.971 --> 19:38.544
So the big day comes, she strips off,
gets on her horse naked.

19:38.544 --> 19:43.115
Luckily, she's got long hair,
because if she'd had a bob...

19:45.717 --> 19:51.390
Now, everyone in the town
has agreed to stay indoors.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.759
There's always one, isn't there?

19:53.759 --> 19:55.727
This time it was Tom.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.729
Dirty, nosey Tom.

19:57.729 --> 20:00.666
(laughs)

20:00.666 --> 20:02.834
Nosey, dirty Tom.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.237
So he's like, "Who's gonna know?"

20:05.237 --> 20:06.605
(clicks tongue)

20:06.605 --> 20:08.707
So he drills a hole in his shutter.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.642
(drill whirrs)

20:10.642 --> 20:12.344
So he's waiting,

20:12.344 --> 20:16.481
and he's like, "Oh, this'll be
worth it, I'll tell you now."

20:16.481 --> 20:20.452
So she rides through the town
and then when she get to Tom's house,

20:20.452 --> 20:22.721
he gets a proper eyeful of Godiva.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.391
He's like, "Oh, look at that! Yes!"

20:26.391 --> 20:29.127
"Look at that." Gone. She's gone.

20:29.127 --> 20:33.599
So Lady Godiva goes home to Leofric
and says "I've done it,"

20:33.599 --> 20:37.069
and he's like,
"Shit a brick, you've done it?"

20:37.069 --> 20:39.671
"Oh, my God! You actually did it?"

20:39.671 --> 20:44.509
So he lifts the taxes and everyone of
Coventry is like, "Fantastic."

20:44.509 --> 20:47.212
Everyone's happy apart from Tom.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.247
Because he's blind.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.083
(laughs)

20:51.083 --> 20:54.286
He's gone blind. It's not funny.

20:54.286 --> 20:58.423
And everyone's like, "What have you
done? You must have done something."

20:58.423 --> 21:02.394
And he's like, "All right, I had
a little sneaky peek of Lady Godiva."

21:02.394 --> 21:05.964
They're like, "You fucking idiot.
You know what's happened?"

21:05.964 --> 21:08.467
"God has struck you blind."

21:08.467 --> 21:10.602
So they called him Peeping Tom.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.872
"Dirty. Dirty Peeping Tom."

21:13.872 --> 21:15.674
"Just to teach him a lesson."

21:15.674 --> 21:20.646
So, let this be a lesson to anyone
who wants to spy on dirty...

21:20.646 --> 21:23.649
Dirty... Dirty lady...

21:23.649 --> 21:27.552
So, let this be a lesson to anyone...

21:28.754 --> 21:30.856
(giggles)

21:32.124 --> 21:35.293
...who wants to spy on dirty ladies.

21:35.293 --> 21:37.529
(splutters)

21:37.529 --> 21:41.033
If you want to see the females of
Coventry get naked these days,

21:41.033 --> 21:44.703
just visit on a Friday around
midnight and check behind the bins.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.239
That's the end of
this week's Drunk History.

21:47.239 --> 21:51.243
Our comedians' shoes aren't gonna
piss all over themselves, are they?

21:51.243 --> 21:52.878
Good night.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.369
(barks)
