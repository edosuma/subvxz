00:02.068 --> 00:05.305
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.973
Hey, Sam!

00:06.973 --> 00:08.341
Hey, Woody. Is it all right

00:08.341 --> 00:10.310
if I hang some Christmas
decorations in here?

00:10.310 --> 00:13.313
Sure. Boy, is it that time again?

00:13.313 --> 00:16.315
Wow, Christmas comes earlier
every year, doesn't it?

00:16.315 --> 00:18.818
I think if you check, Sam,

00:19.319 --> 00:22.822
it always comes on the 25th of December.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.324
Of course, of course, of course.

00:24.324 --> 00:27.277
Thank you, Woody, thank you.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.779
Oh, look at that, will ya?

00:29.779 --> 00:30.663
Nice Rudolph.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.115
I made him myself.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.116
No kidding?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.118
You know, uh, Rudolph is my favorite guy

00:35.118 --> 00:36.619
in the Christmas songs.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.004
Yeah.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.756
You know, apparently
then, Woody, you're unaware

00:39.756 --> 00:42.258
that the story of Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer

00:42.258 --> 00:43.259
is one of the most unrealistic,

00:43.760 --> 00:44.761
and therefore potentially damaging

00:44.761 --> 00:46.262
in all of children's music.

00:46.262 --> 00:48.264
It gives them a horribly
distorted view of reality.

00:48.264 --> 00:50.767
Yeah, but you gotta admit,
it's easy to whistle.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.268
Look, I'm serious.

00:52.268 --> 00:54.938
You know, first the other reindeer tease

00:54.938 --> 00:56.306
and then ostracize him.

00:56.306 --> 01:00.226
And then when his abnormality
proves of service, they use him.

01:02.112 --> 01:03.396
But then do they allow him to play

01:03.396 --> 01:04.397
in their stupid reindeer games?

01:04.397 --> 01:05.397
BOTH: Yes.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.399
Oh, no, no, no,

01:06.399 --> 01:07.901
I know how the song goes.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.902
In fact,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.904
not only do Donner, Blitzen, et al,

01:10.904 --> 01:13.907
not love him and laugh out with glee,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.292
but they doubly despise the
bulbous-nosed little wimp.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.329
Well, I gotta be off.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.713
(cheerful): Happy Holidays!

01:22.966 --> 01:26.419
(piano plays)

01:26.886 --> 01:29.172
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:29.172 --> 01:32.175
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:32.175 --> 01:35.178
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:35.178 --> 01:38.181
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:38.181 --> 01:44.737
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:44.737 --> 01:46.239
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:46.239 --> 01:51.744
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:51.744 --> 01:56.749
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:56.749 --> 01:58.751
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:58.751 --> 02:01.754
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:01.754 --> 02:06.759
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:06.759 --> 02:09.262
? You want to go where people know ?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.764
? People are all the same ?

02:11.764 --> 02:16.269
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.911
Prithee, friends, what thinkst thou?

02:43.913 --> 02:45.915
You look ridiculous.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.917
I beg your pardon.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.919
This is an absolutely authentic example

02:49.919 --> 02:51.921
of feminine colonial headwear.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.423
I'm sorry.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.425
Thou lookest ridiculous.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.431
Hey, Miss Chambers, what's
the pilgrim get-up for?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.316
Oh, I was hoping somebody might ask.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.269
We're gonna have to talk later, Woody.

03:06.269 --> 03:10.273
My graduate American Literature
professor, Doctor Narsutis,

03:10.273 --> 03:14.277
annually recreates the first
Thanksgiving dinner at his home.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.780
He only invites two or
three favored students

03:17.780 --> 03:21.284
to break bread with his
family and other honored guests

03:21.284 --> 03:23.286
such as William Styron.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.288
And guess who's going to be there?

03:25.288 --> 03:28.291
William Styron?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.294
Yes, Woody.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.795
Ah, heck, anybody coulda got it

03:32.795 --> 03:34.297
if they'd really been listening.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.801
What a wonderful
opportunity for you, Diane.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.270
You know, perhaps in the evening

03:40.270 --> 03:42.272
you can establish a
rapport with Mr. Styron

03:42.272 --> 03:43.773
while passing the yams.

03:43.773 --> 03:45.775
Who knows? Come pie time,

03:45.775 --> 03:47.277
he may well have taken
you under his wing

03:47.277 --> 03:49.779
and launched you into
the literary galaxy.

03:49.779 --> 03:52.782
Frasier, you and I are of like mind.

03:52.782 --> 03:54.784
Except one of us is kidding.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.327
Sam, I had thought we would
spend the holidays together,

04:04.327 --> 04:06.829
but when you made no
move in that direction,

04:06.829 --> 04:08.831
I made these alternate plans.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.833
I hope it won't spoil your holiday.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.336
Thank you. No, I, I
have, I have other plans.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.339
Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.839
And in all fairness, I will understand

04:17.839 --> 04:19.341
if you get an escort for the day.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.844
It really wouldn't hurt my
feelings in the slightest.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.729
Good. Good, good,

04:22.729 --> 04:24.981
'cause I already have a date with Wendy.

04:24.981 --> 04:27.483
How could you?

04:27.483 --> 04:30.486
Now you just said that
it was okay, didn't you?

04:30.486 --> 04:32.989
Yes.

04:34.991 --> 04:36.993
I'm sorry.

04:36.993 --> 04:38.494
It's fine.

04:38.494 --> 04:39.495
Enjoy.

04:39.495 --> 04:40.496
Thank you.

04:40.496 --> 04:41.998
Besides, I know that

04:41.998 --> 04:44.500
we'll have many holidays together

04:44.500 --> 04:46.502
when you and I are one.

04:46.502 --> 04:49.005
You already are one, Diane.

04:51.507 --> 04:55.011
So, what's everybody else doing?

04:55.011 --> 04:57.380
Oh, the holidays just
kind of snuck up...

04:57.380 --> 04:58.214
NORM: My
mother-in-law...

04:58.214 --> 05:00.717
Yeah, that sounds like fun, too.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.470
Well, I'm on my own this year.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.972
Kids aren't with ya?

05:05.972 --> 05:08.358
Nah. They're in Atlantic City with Nick.

05:09.359 --> 05:11.861
Yeah, this is my first
Thanksgiving away from home.

05:11.861 --> 05:14.364
I mean, unless you count last year.

05:16.866 --> 05:18.868
Wait a second. Listen to you.

05:18.868 --> 05:20.370
Carla, you have a new place.

05:20.370 --> 05:21.871
You could have a little gathering.

05:21.871 --> 05:22.872
Forget it.

05:23.373 --> 05:24.874
Oh, come on.

05:24.874 --> 05:26.376
What could be more enjoyable

05:26.376 --> 05:28.878
than opening your heart
with holiday cheer?

05:28.878 --> 05:31.381
Opening yours with a can opener?

05:32.882 --> 05:34.884
That sounds great!

05:34.884 --> 05:37.387
No, I meant the first
part, Miss Chambers.

05:37.387 --> 05:40.390
Well, why not?

05:40.390 --> 05:43.893
But it's gonna have to be potluck.

05:43.893 --> 05:45.895
Sammy, why don't you bring
your date and join us?

05:45.895 --> 05:46.896
All right.

05:46.896 --> 05:49.399
Tell you what, Carla.
I'm good for dessert.

05:49.399 --> 05:51.267
So I've been told.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.519
You know, I'm glad to see

05:53.519 --> 05:55.521
that you're all fending
off the holiday blues.

05:55.521 --> 05:59.025
This time of year is
filled with arguments,

05:59.025 --> 06:00.526
suicides, murders.

06:00.526 --> 06:04.030
Yeah, I guess it's the seasonal
happiness of others tends

06:04.030 --> 06:05.531
to throw a glaring light on the flaws

06:05.531 --> 06:07.033
in our own interpersonal relationships.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.534
But see, of course,
that's no problem for me.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.920
I'm alone.

06:12.255 --> 06:14.123
Wanna join us for some bird, Frasier?

06:14.123 --> 06:16.592
Could I?

06:19.595 --> 06:21.097
Sure. The more the merrier.

06:21.097 --> 06:23.850
Hey, so, uh, what time do
you want us there, Carla?

06:23.850 --> 06:26.135
What do you mean "us," Clavin?

06:26.135 --> 06:27.136
Well, you know...

06:27.136 --> 06:28.137
This party

06:28.137 --> 06:31.023
is for lonelies, not homelies.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.527
Besides, you'll be with your mother.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.028
No, no, not this year.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.530
Uh, she's goin' down

06:37.530 --> 06:39.031
and ladle out some cream of something

06:39.031 --> 06:40.783
to the folks down at the Rescue Mission.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.568
Yeah. Oh, how sweet.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.569
Why don't you join her?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.570
Are you kiddin'?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.072
I did my part this year.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.574
I was in "Hands Across
America," remember?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.960
Oh. Okay.

06:50.960 --> 06:51.961
All right.

06:51.961 --> 06:53.463
Norm, how about you and Vera?

06:53.463 --> 06:54.464
Yeah?

06:54.464 --> 06:55.465
No, I can't make it this year.

06:55.465 --> 06:57.333
Why not? I mean, we never even met Vera.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.134
CARLA: Yeah.

06:58.134 --> 06:59.635
No, we gotta go to Vera's mother's.

06:59.635 --> 07:01.637
Such a drag.

07:01.637 --> 07:05.057
No beer, no TV, heat turned up to 80.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.560
CLIFF: That's all
right, Normie, you know.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.431
You gotta do what your
little wifey wants you to do.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.816
You either got 'em or you don't.

07:13.816 --> 07:14.817
All right.

07:14.817 --> 07:16.819
You know somethin', Cliff,
you're absolutely right.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.322
Eight years I've been goin'
to that old bat's house.

07:19.322 --> 07:20.690
I think Vera owes me one, all right?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.575
I'm gonna march into that house.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.576
I'm just gonna say,

07:23.576 --> 07:25.528
"Vera, this year we're goin'
to Carla's for Thanksgiving.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.029
That's the last I wanna
hear on the subject."

07:27.029 --> 07:29.031
All right! Good for you, Norm.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.534
Okay, Norm's out.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.004
Just count me in, all right? You'll see.

07:35.505 --> 07:37.006
Well, my house, noonish?

07:37.006 --> 07:40.009
WOODY: Oh, this is gonna
be the greatest, huh?

07:40.009 --> 07:41.511
SAM: All right.

07:41.511 --> 07:42.512
Well, I'm so relieved.

07:42.512 --> 07:44.013
Now I don't have to worry

07:44.013 --> 07:46.015
about my poor little
Thanksgiving orphans

07:46.015 --> 07:50.019
whilst I sup with the literati.

07:50.019 --> 07:52.021
Boy, you know, I don't
know who's luckier.

07:52.021 --> 07:54.474
You, 'cause you get to
go to that great party,

07:54.474 --> 07:58.361
or us 'cause you get to
go to that great party.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.653
Taken down at the 40.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.406
And there's the gun
ending the first half.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.708
Yeah, this is just like bein' back home.

08:12.708 --> 08:14.710
Yeah, hey, uh, Carla, look, I, uh,

08:14.710 --> 08:16.712
I really wanna tell ya
how much I appreciate

08:16.712 --> 08:18.214
you, uh, invitin' me over here.

08:18.214 --> 08:19.582
Don't mention it.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.217
I, uh, really appreciate it.

08:21.217 --> 08:23.002
No, I mean, don't ever mention

08:23.002 --> 08:26.389
to anyone that I let you in this house.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.559
May I change the channel

08:29.559 --> 08:31.561
or are you guys watching
this halftime salute

08:31.561 --> 08:32.562
to our fabulous universe?

08:32.562 --> 08:33.563
No, go ahead.

08:33.563 --> 08:34.981
Oh, the parade.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.517
And who's this flying our way?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.402
None other than a 60-foot Mighty Mouse.

08:39.402 --> 08:43.356
All right, Mighty Mouse!

08:43.356 --> 08:44.357
(doorbell rings)

08:44.357 --> 08:45.241
I'll get it.

08:48.244 --> 08:49.245
Afternoon, everybody.

08:49.245 --> 08:52.248
ALL: Norm!

08:52.248 --> 08:53.749
Where's Vera?

08:53.749 --> 08:56.752
She's, uh, she's gonna put
on a little more makeup.

08:56.752 --> 08:59.622
That, uh, first coat didn't really take.

09:02.592 --> 09:04.460
She is comin', isn't she?

09:04.460 --> 09:06.796
Well, uh, maybe.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.764
Well, what're you sayin' there, Normie?

09:08.764 --> 09:11.217
We had the worst fight of our marriage.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.687
Oh, it's tough.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.188
She knew how much this meant to me

09:16.188 --> 09:18.190
and she still insisted
on goin' to her mother's.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.694
So I told her, "Look,
I'm goin' to Carla's.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.195
"You wanna meet me there, fine.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.697
"If you want to go to your mother's,

09:24.697 --> 09:26.065
you can just stay there."

09:26.065 --> 09:27.817
CLIFF: Brutal.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.292
Well, you know, Norm,

09:36.292 --> 09:38.294
I don't think you should worry about it.

09:38.294 --> 09:40.546
She'll probably come to
her senses and show up.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.382
The important thing is that
you're here with us now.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.885
This is gonna be the
best Thanksgiving ever.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.386
All right, Woody.

09:47.386 --> 09:50.506
You know, I brought
that turkey and, uh...

09:54.393 --> 09:56.262
Mr. P., that turkey
seems kinda big and raw.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.147
You think it's gonna be
ready in time for dinner?

09:58.147 --> 10:02.018
Well, I had planned on just a
bit more cookin' time, Woods,

10:02.018 --> 10:04.904
but, uh, traffic on I-93
was bumper-to-bumper.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.272
I-93? I took the side streets.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.157
I got here in 35 minutes, buddy.

10:08.157 --> 10:08.908
You didn't take Mass Avenue all the way?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.409
I took Commonwealth.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.828
(all talking)

10:12.828 --> 10:14.830
I need the quickest way to
get to the kitchen right now.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.332
Oh, yeah, come on.

10:16.332 --> 10:17.333
I'll show you where everything is.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.044
Oh, hey, no waitin'
around for my contribution.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.046
Here ya go.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.047
Popcorn balls!

10:31.547 --> 10:32.548
Chow down, hear?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.050
Hey, aren't these what you brought

10:34.050 --> 10:35.051
to the Halloween party?

10:35.051 --> 10:37.053
Well, yeah, they're a
perennial favorite, Woodman.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.054
Yeah, but aren't these the ones

10:38.054 --> 10:39.555
you brought to the Halloween party?

10:39.555 --> 10:41.524
(doorbell rings)

10:45.528 --> 10:47.279
Hi.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.948
Oh, hi, Sammy. I thought
maybe you were Vera.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.150
Boy, I can't wait to meet her.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.568
FRASIER: Sammy, yo!

10:52.568 --> 10:55.571
Hey, Sammy! Hey, Sam.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.572
So, uh, where's your date?

10:56.572 --> 10:59.075
Oh. Well, there's a change of plans.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.576
Her sister showed up from out of town

11:00.576 --> 11:04.580
and they didn't like my idea,
so what the hell, you know?

11:04.580 --> 11:08.084
Hey, guys.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.086
Hey, yeah, watch the parade.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.009
You know, the important thing
is that you're here now, huh?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.010
We're all here.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.512
This is gonna be the greatest.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.513
Yeah. Who needs family?

11:20.513 --> 11:21.514
You know, Woody, you're right.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.015
Family is not necessarily

11:23.015 --> 11:24.517
limited to blood relations.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.518
That's right.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.019
Uh, this is much better
than, uh, hangin' around

11:27.520 --> 11:29.021
with a bunch of dingbat
cousins all day long

11:29.021 --> 11:30.523
that you don't get to
see but once a year, huh?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.525
Yeah, or waiting for some
duddy old aunt to show up

11:32.525 --> 11:34.577
(doorbell rings) and spoil all your fun.

11:34.577 --> 11:36.445
Gobble, gobble!

11:43.536 --> 11:44.920
(doorbell rings)

11:46.672 --> 11:47.707
Come on, open the door.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.708
No, no...

11:48.708 --> 11:50.209
It's Thanksgiving, Carla.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.711
Oh! Okay...

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
maybe she'll choke on a drumstick.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.714
Yeah.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.600
Thank you, Carla.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.518
Hello, everyone.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.020
Hi, Miss Chambers.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.022
Hey, uh, Diane.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.025
Ooh, Carla, I like what
you've done with the place.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.393
What do you want?

12:07.393 --> 12:11.731
Well, I decided that I'd
rather be among friends

12:11.731 --> 12:13.733
than with my stuffy old professor.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.737
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.240
What happened?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.742
Oh... Come on.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.662
I'm afraid my golden
afternoon turned to dross.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.464
I thought it was clouding up.

12:30.466 --> 12:32.468
The moment I arrived at
the home of my professor,

12:32.468 --> 12:37.473
I was greeted by a man with a
clipboard who handed me a tray

12:37.473 --> 12:39.842
and told me to serve a
daiquiri to Ms. Radziwill.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.093
Oh...

12:41.093 --> 12:44.313
We students were
invited as domestic help.

12:44.313 --> 12:45.648
(Carla giggles)

12:49.151 --> 12:53.155
That might be all right when
you're a wide-eyed 19-year-old,

12:53.155 --> 12:56.025
but it's certainly not all
right when you're... not.

12:57.993 --> 12:59.862
We're all... we're very sorry, Diane.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.831
Thank you, Sam.

13:01.831 --> 13:02.832
Yeah.

13:02.832 --> 13:05.334
Well, at least you told
that pinhead off, didn't ya?

13:05.334 --> 13:08.838
Oh, I dropped the
tray, burst into tears,

13:08.838 --> 13:12.708
took a moment to freshen
up my mascara, and fled.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.461
The important thing is
you're here now, huh?

13:15.461 --> 13:16.962
This is gonna be great.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.465
Would somebody put a gag on Andy Hardy?

13:20.466 --> 13:21.467
You know, Diane, if I were you,

13:21.467 --> 13:22.468
I'd call that guy up

13:22.468 --> 13:24.970
and nail his sheepskin to the wall.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.972
You're absolutely right.

13:26.972 --> 13:27.973
Hey, better yet.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.227
Why don't you go on over
there and tell him in person?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.528
Yeah, good idea. Yeah, that's right.

13:34.029 --> 13:35.531
Hello, Dr. Narsutis?

13:35.531 --> 13:37.032
This is Diane Chambers.

13:37.032 --> 13:39.034
I... yes, the one who fled.

13:39.034 --> 13:43.038
Listen, I... I beg your pardon?

13:43.038 --> 13:48.544
Well, yes, of course
I accept your apology.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.545
He's invited me back.

13:49.545 --> 13:52.414
Go, go. Go.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.800
Dr. Narsutis, I'm sorry, I can't.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.168
I'm here with my friends,

13:56.168 --> 13:57.920
my support system,

13:57.920 --> 14:00.222
and there's really no
place I'd rather be.

14:00.222 --> 14:04.727
I trust this won't affect my grade?

14:04.727 --> 14:05.728
Thank you.

14:05.728 --> 14:06.729
Good day, sir.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.648
Turned him down, huh?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.986
Now that I find myself in
the warmth of your company

14:13.986 --> 14:15.487
how could I possibly go?

14:15.988 --> 14:16.989
Take Mass Ave.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.490
I-93.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.492
You holiday hooligans.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.994
Give me a beer.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
So, Sam--
Thanks.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.366
Where's your date?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.868
Oh, change of plans.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.369
Her sister showed up.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.371
Of course she did.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.758
Chortle, chortle.

14:35.758 --> 14:38.210
No, I'm serious.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.712
I had a date and it fell through.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.597
Oh, you don't have to convince me, Sam.

14:41.597 --> 14:42.598
I believe you.

14:42.598 --> 14:45.601
I'm telling you the truth.

14:45.601 --> 14:47.970
And I love you for it.

14:50.773 --> 14:52.725
How's the turkey doing there, Norm?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.727
I'd say pretty good
for about five minutes.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.111
Oh.

14:56.111 --> 14:58.397
Hey, half-time's over.
The game's back on.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.398
Oh, great.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.400
Oh, you're watching sports?

15:01.901 --> 15:02.818
Hey, don't worry about it, Diane.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.903
Game's almost over.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.288
Oh, I hope so.

15:06.288 --> 15:09.625
ANNOUNCER: ...knocked away
and it's incomplete at the 45.

15:12.127 --> 15:13.128
Yeah, I deliver his mail.

15:13.128 --> 15:15.631
Isn't this game over yet?

15:15.631 --> 15:16.382
Not yet.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.716
Well, their uniforms

15:17.716 --> 15:19.969
are different colors than before.

15:19.969 --> 15:21.253
Uh, well, they gotta change them

15:21.253 --> 15:23.138
every time they score
a touchdown, Diane.

15:24.974 --> 15:26.175
Hey, Normie,

15:26.175 --> 15:28.010
where the hell is that bird?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.895
Cliffy, it's a big turkey.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.013
So are you.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.905
ANNOUNCER: ...with a
tremendous body slam!

15:39.905 --> 15:44.193
Now wait a minute!

15:44.193 --> 15:45.694
Diane, Diane, you're absolutely right.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.197
You know, let's turn it
back on the football, guys.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.198
There you go. No, no, no!

15:49.198 --> 15:50.699
Enough is enough!

15:50.699 --> 15:52.701
I don't think watching television

15:52.701 --> 15:54.703
was the pilgrims' original intent

15:54.703 --> 15:56.705
when they created the holiday.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.706
Well, uh...

15:57.706 --> 15:58.707
No, hey, hey, hey... Hey, come on!

15:59.208 --> 16:00.709
All right, all right,
look, look, look, look,

16:00.709 --> 16:03.212
the turkey's probably almost done.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.713
Let's just adjourn to
the dining room, huh?

16:04.713 --> 16:06.215
All right!

16:06.215 --> 16:07.716
I second that emotion.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.718
Okay, we'll be sitting

16:09.718 --> 16:10.719
boy-girl,
boy-girl.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.722
Clavin, you can sit anywhere.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.224
Somebody save me a seat.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.226
I got to see a man about a horse.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.728
He doesn't really have to
see a man about a horse.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.236
All right.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.738
Well, what do you say
we, uh, dig into this, uh,

16:29.738 --> 16:31.240
Jell-O surprise here?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.741
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

16:32.741 --> 16:33.742
we're not eating

16:33.742 --> 16:35.244
until the turkey is on the table.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.129
Everybody went to a lot of bother

16:37.129 --> 16:38.380
to make this fine meal.

16:38.380 --> 16:39.882
We're not going to eat it in pieces.

16:39.882 --> 16:42.885
Keep your hands off the food.

16:42.885 --> 16:44.887
Listen, guys, the, uh,

16:44.887 --> 16:47.389
turkey's not exactly brown just yet.

16:47.389 --> 16:48.390
What color is it, then?

16:48.390 --> 16:49.892
Off-white.

16:49.892 --> 16:52.394
(all moan)

16:52.394 --> 16:54.897
But I've reset the timer
and I turned up the gas.

16:54.897 --> 16:56.398
I expect the little pop thing

16:56.398 --> 16:57.399
will be popping out any time now.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.903
Great. Well, I hope it
hurries 'cause I'm starved.

17:00.903 --> 17:04.906
Well, I suggest we take
advantage of the delay

17:04.906 --> 17:07.659
and engage in one of
my family's favorite

17:07.659 --> 17:09.862
little Thanksgiving traditions.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.195
Sam, I know you're
standing in the hallway.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.196
Get in here.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.202
Rats.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.704
In lieu of grace,

17:18.704 --> 17:20.705
we stand up and take turns

17:20.705 --> 17:22.708
toasting that for which we are thankful.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.710
Since you're already standing,
Sam, why don't you begin?

17:26.627 --> 17:28.130
All right, I'm, uh...

17:28.130 --> 17:32.634
I'm thankful that I have a
super car and a cool stereo

17:32.634 --> 17:35.554
and that I'm not dressed
in a pilgrim's outfit.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.555
(chuckling)

17:36.555 --> 17:37.556
I'll drink to that.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.058
You make a mockery of everything.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.309
Oh, well...

17:40.309 --> 17:41.477
Hey, can I go next?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.728
I don't see a line.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.614
(chanting): Woody. Woody. Woody.

17:45.614 --> 17:47.116
(chuckles)

17:47.116 --> 17:48.117
Uh...

17:48.117 --> 17:50.486
I'm thankful that I'm an American.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.954
Hey, all right.

17:51.954 --> 17:52.955
I'm thankful for the upbringing

17:52.955 --> 17:54.957
my parents gave me.

17:54.957 --> 17:57.459
Uh, I'm thankful for all the friends

17:57.459 --> 17:58.827
I've made in Boston.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.629
And, uh...

18:00.629 --> 18:03.132
I'm thankful that I can do this.

18:03.132 --> 18:05.134
Yo!

18:05.134 --> 18:06.635
Put it away.

18:06.635 --> 18:07.503
(chuckling)

18:07.503 --> 18:09.838
Hey, can you guys do this?

18:09.838 --> 18:11.340
Oh!

18:11.340 --> 18:14.343
That makes my thing look kinda stupid.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.844
I can wiggle my ears, watch this.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.229
You guys ever see tongue push-ups?

18:17.229 --> 18:18.564
Look at these ears flapping.

18:18.564 --> 18:19.565
Watch this.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.066
Please, please!

18:21.066 --> 18:23.068
We are not here to be thankful

18:23.068 --> 18:26.572
for strange things we
can do with our bodies.

18:30.492 --> 18:31.994
Norman, you're next.

18:31.994 --> 18:34.413
Well, I'm thankful that
there's a turkey in the kitchen

18:34.413 --> 18:35.914
that needs to be checked.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.416
Yeah. Yeah, get the damn thing out here.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.417
(everyone talking)

18:38.917 --> 18:41.920
All right, I guess I need
to give you an indication

18:41.920 --> 18:43.422
of what I had in mind.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.924
Now I, too, am very
thankful for my health

18:45.924 --> 18:47.426
and for my dear friends.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.928
But on this very special occasion,

18:49.928 --> 18:51.430
my mind goes back over the years

18:51.430 --> 18:53.932
to the people who have influenced me.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.436
And I would like to name
some of them for you.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.937
Teilhard Chardin...

19:00.772 --> 19:02.224
George Sand...

19:02.224 --> 19:04.860
Caravaggio...

19:04.860 --> 19:07.646
Oh, Emily Dickenson...

19:07.646 --> 19:09.031
the Buddha...

19:10.449 --> 19:11.867
Frank Lloyd Wright...

19:12.868 --> 19:14.369
...Jean d'Arc...

19:14.369 --> 19:16.872
Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.877
Uh, guys, uh, listen,

19:21.877 --> 19:23.378
I'm having a slight, uh, problem

19:23.378 --> 19:24.880
with the damn bird, all right?

19:24.880 --> 19:26.882
What color is it now, Norman?

19:26.882 --> 19:29.384
Well, I think we're moving
into the earth tones.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.841
This better be good news, Norm.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.843
Look, uh, I'm sorry, guys.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.344
The little pop thing won't pop out.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.846
There's something wrong with it.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.847
There's something wrong with you.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.849
No, no, it's the little pop thing.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.851
Hey, could somebody please explain to me

19:45.851 --> 19:47.853
where the little pop
thing is on the turkey?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.855
I mean, 'cause maybe it's
different in the city,

19:49.855 --> 19:51.356
but in the country where I come from,

19:51.356 --> 19:54.860
turkeys aren't born
with little pop things.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.361
The little pop thing has a name!

19:56.361 --> 19:57.863
It's called a thermometer!

19:57.863 --> 19:59.865
Now can we all please say "thermometer."

19:59.865 --> 20:00.866
(yells): Thermometer!

20:00.866 --> 20:01.867
Thermometer, yeah!

20:01.867 --> 20:03.869
We can say it till
we're blue in the face.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.371
It's not gonna make
it pop out any faster.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.374
I think something's wrong
with your oven, Carla.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.376
Hey, my oven was just fine

20:11.376 --> 20:13.262
until you stuffed Birdzilla in it.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.015
Come on, you guys, come on.

20:17.015 --> 20:20.018
We don't have to bite each
other's heads off here.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.938
It may be the only thing we
get to eat this day, Sammy.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.476
Hey, you guys, this is Thanksgiving.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.979
And I still say this is
going to be the greatest.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.898
Oh, who the hell do
we think we're kidding?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.399
We're all a bunch of pathetic dropouts.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.236
Scorned by our loved ones,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.737
as if anybody ever loved us at all.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.739
Hey, will you lighten up, man?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.241
The only thing wrong
here is we're hungry.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.742
Now who else wants
to join me in these...

20:43.742 --> 20:47.212
ice-cold potatoes?

20:47.212 --> 20:49.881
Hey, they'll go great here
with the, uh, Jell-O soup.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.333
I'm dying to try some of the hair

20:51.333 --> 20:54.253
growing on the crudités.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.255
Well, pass me my peas.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.141
I made them so I know they're okay.

20:59.141 --> 21:02.010
Was that remark, uh, directed
at me, Carla, by any chance?

21:02.010 --> 21:04.513
No, it was directed
at your stupid turkey

21:04.513 --> 21:07.015
and your stupid stuffing
and your stupid gravy.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.517
What's wrong with my gravy?

21:08.517 --> 21:09.818
Oh, nothing, except you could

21:09.818 --> 21:12.738
walk across the skin on top of it.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.239
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Julia Child.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.741
Here's your perfect peas.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.743
Oh, look, I spilled one. Sorry.

21:20.746 --> 21:21.747
Thank you.

21:23.665 --> 21:26.668
Norm, I'm sorry about what
I said about your gravy.

21:26.668 --> 21:28.170
All right.

21:28.170 --> 21:29.538
It's okay. Fine.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.922
And so are the carrots.

21:34.259 --> 21:37.679
Uh, anybody want some of
these, uh, lovely yams?

21:43.635 --> 21:47.306
Woody, would you care
to test the gravy skin?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.311
People! People! People!

21:52.311 --> 21:55.063
Stop this immediately!

22:00.118 --> 22:06.541
I have never been witness
to such a silly, soph...

22:14.416 --> 22:16.385
Sam Malone...

22:16.885 --> 22:18.253
kiss your butt good-bye!

22:18.253 --> 22:19.638
Food fight!

22:19.638 --> 22:22.641
(yelling)

22:32.651 --> 22:34.152
(yelling)

22:41.410 --> 22:43.362
I knew this was gonna be the greatest.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.863
Huh?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.114
Good bird.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.450
Hey, Diane, may I say

22:48.450 --> 22:50.952
you look saucy in cranberry.

22:50.952 --> 22:51.953
(chuckling)

22:51.953 --> 22:53.955
Laugh while you can, Sam.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.458
Just remember that revenge is a dish

22:56.458 --> 22:57.959
best served cold.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.462
You won't know when and
you won't know where,

23:00.462 --> 23:02.464
but I'm going to get you.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.965
Now that we're done with dinner,

23:03.965 --> 23:05.967
I'd like to make a
toast to our loved ones

23:05.967 --> 23:08.470
who weren't fortunate
enough to be here with us.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.971
Nice thought.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.808
Uh, Mom, Dad...

23:12.808 --> 23:14.359
Uncle Fergie...

23:14.359 --> 23:15.861
My kids.

23:15.861 --> 23:17.362
All right, Vera.

23:17.362 --> 23:18.363
Yeah. Ma.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.365
Coach. ALL: Yeah.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.368
Oh... God bless you all. Very nice.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.873
Well, I think we're
about ready for dessert.

23:27.873 --> 23:28.874
Yeah.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.375
Everybody get enough to eat?

23:30.375 --> 23:32.377
You know, I never had a
chance to try the potatoes.

23:32.377 --> 23:33.378
(doorbell rings) I'll get it.

23:33.879 --> 23:35.380
Oh, well, here, let
me, uh... Oh, thank you.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.381
There you go, man. Sure.

23:39.134 --> 23:40.635
NORM: Vera. You came.

23:40.635 --> 23:42.137
Honey, I'm so happy.

23:42.137 --> 23:43.138
Hey, you guys, uh...

23:43.138 --> 23:45.640
Come on, Vera, come on
in, meet all the guys.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.642
This is great. We
finally get to meet Vera.

23:47.642 --> 23:49.511
Sam...

23:49.511 --> 23:51.263
think fast!

23:55.767 --> 23:58.653
Everybody, this is, uh, Vera...

23:58.653 --> 23:59.988
VERA: Charming friends, Norm.

23:59.988 --> 24:00.989
Get your coat.

24:00.989 --> 24:02.491
NORM: Yes, dear.
