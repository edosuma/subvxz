We're two of a kind, Ewan,

Ah.

00:18.039 --> 00:19.666
-Is something wrong?
-Wrong?

00:19.749 --> 00:20.959
Oh, of course
there's nothing wrong.

in that buggy.

00:23.503 --> 00:25.964
Well, then,
I'll see you later, eh?

00:26.047 --> 00:27.382
I do hope so.

00:28.842 --> 00:30.301
Oh, no, no.

00:31.177 --> 00:32.220
Oh.

00:33.263 --> 00:35.849
Ah! Ooh, cramp!

00:39.227 --> 00:41.312
You... You all done, then?

00:41.396 --> 00:43.857
We are ready
to take our place

you're thinking.

Not for another six weeks
you're not.

She's shrunk.
Just as well.

If you get caught
even sitting in this thing,

00:56.745 --> 00:59.622

for a year... Or that.

I never thought I'd have
a probation officer
for a nephew.

Look, I've got better things
to do with my time.

01:04.961 --> 01:06.504
Shh.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.631
Good night, old thing.

our time will come.

you've been looking for?

someone must have stolen
from your car?

02:13.737 --> 02:16.491

Could be anything.

I think Paul's meeting
her parents tonight.

-Very...you.

Do you think Isobel
will like it?

03:13.006 --> 03:16.301
Well, she won't be
impressed by the price,
if that's what you mean.

03:16.384 --> 03:18.178
What will she be impressed by?

03:18.261 --> 03:19.929
I don't know, Chester.

you girls talk about stuff.

for Mummy and Daddy.

03:29.022 --> 03:30.899
Not in any significant way,
no.

03:34.027 --> 03:35.236
Why?

03:37.572 --> 03:40.992
Look, Chester,
I just don't think
you're her type.

03:41.993 --> 03:43.870
What is her type?

03:43.953 --> 03:46.664
-Earthy, uncomplicated,
in touch with nature.
-I can do those.

You and Lucy.

04:06.309 --> 04:09.312
It's all getting
a bit serious, isn't it?

04:09.396 --> 04:12.607
If you mean I'm seeing
a lot of her, then, yeah.

they're coming to dinner.

I've just left Chester playing
with his silly new toy.

04:29.623 --> 04:31.042
Is everything all right?

04:31.126 --> 04:34.504
Yeah, great. Just great.

04:34.587 --> 04:37.090
I thought we could
go down to Isobel's
and look in on Smokey.

04:39.384 --> 04:40.718
Well, I...

04:41.678 --> 04:43.054
I could finish off here.

Okay, great.

Thanks.

-Do you think he's
looking all right?
-Well, he seems okay to me.

05:01.489 --> 05:03.324
Why didn't you
stable him at Chester's?

05:03.408 --> 05:05.118
Oh, Chester's got
a thing about horses.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.329
You haven't stopped
looking at that thing
since we got here.

05:09.414 --> 05:12.542
-I'm running a bit late,
that's all.
-Late?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.712
Yeah, I've got to
go through the mail,
make a couple of calls

05:15.795 --> 05:18.256
and, you know,
put the finishing touches to
the dinner for your parents.

05:18.673 --> 05:20.175
Oh.

05:20.258 --> 05:24.971
They're gonna be here
in eight hours and 22 minutes.

05:25.054 --> 05:26.222
If we were ever late
for anything,

05:26.306 --> 05:28.558
Daddy would go into
his stiff old grumps,

05:28.641 --> 05:30.435
which will make us girls
feel horribly inadequate,

05:30.518 --> 05:33.855
and Mummy would retreat
into one of her cold,
distant sort of moods.

Oh, he's not even here
and look at me.

I promise you.
Come on.

See you later.

06:11.476 --> 06:13.019
Ah, just the man.

06:13.103 --> 06:15.146
Now why does that
make me feel edgy?

for dinner.

How are things working out
between you?

06:23.488 --> 06:26.408
Well, you'd be surprised
how much he's grown up
since I left home.

06:26.491 --> 06:28.868
And I didn't need
Mum reminding me
to get him a present.

06:29.661 --> 06:31.579

add it to the shopping and
be back before you know it.

-I know.

-How's the birthday boy?

07:03.611 --> 07:05.613
He's away to the cabin
for the weekend.

07:05.697 --> 07:07.407
-Fishing.
-I wanted to surprise him.

07:07.490 --> 07:10.034

Didn't you arrange anything?
We always do family stuff
on birthdays.

He wanted to be
with his friends.

from me.

for the footie.

-Aye.

-I'll give it to him myself.
-Ewan!

07:28.303 --> 07:29.971
I'll head oot there
after lunch.

07:30.054 --> 07:31.514
He might have moved on.

07:32.432 --> 07:33.683

celebrating, eh?

half a mile down the road.

-Did she leave a message?
-No.

to do with Meg.

I've chosen mine.

14:19.297 --> 14:22.884
A real live laird. It's a bit
like royalty, isn't it, dear?

14:22.967 --> 14:24.719
I wouldn't go that far.

14:24.803 --> 14:27.680
Forty thousand acres.
It's almost a country.

14:27.764 --> 14:30.391
Chester tells me
it's mostly mountains.

14:31.518 --> 14:33.520
We do own a mountain, yes.

14:33.603 --> 14:34.813
Pay its way, does it?

14:35.730 --> 14:37.440
-We get by.
-Extraordinary.

14:40.443 --> 14:41.569
Shall we go through?

14:49.411 --> 14:50.912
PAUL: More drinks
in the drawing room.

15:00.004 --> 15:01.423
Donald MacDonald.

15:03.758 --> 15:05.427
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

15:08.430 --> 15:09.973
But I don't know how I would
have managed without you.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.934
Well, you're going to have to,
old boy,

15:13.017 --> 15:14.602
because in precisely

15:14.686 --> 15:17.939
five weeks, four days
and eight hours,

15:18.022 --> 15:20.400
my curfew will be lifted

15:20.483 --> 15:22.736
and you won't see me
for tyre smoke.

15:24.904 --> 15:27.657
JESS: There's something
going on with Dad.

15:27.741 --> 15:30.368
Some woman phoned for him
but wouldn't leave her name.

15:31.661 --> 15:33.204
I think he's seeing someone.

15:33.288 --> 15:35.290
Good for him.

15:35.373 --> 15:37.500
It sounds like he's having a
bit of fun getting over Meg.

15:38.418 --> 15:39.461
Every night?

15:41.337 --> 15:42.881
Maybe he's just looking
for reassurance.

15:43.465 --> 15:45.216
And the rest.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.760
Is that really
such a bad thing?

15:46.843 --> 15:48.595
-He's my dad, Isobel.
-So?

15:51.347 --> 15:52.515
So it's embarrassing.

15:56.519 --> 15:58.813
You've certainly landed
on your feet, dear.

15:58.897 --> 16:00.356
Very impressive.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.733
I haven't landed
anywhere, Mummy.

16:01.816 --> 16:03.401
Paul's been kind enough
to invite us for dinner

16:03.485 --> 16:04.778
in his magnificent home
and I really...

16:04.861 --> 16:06.738
Quite right, quite right,
we mustn't presume.

16:06.821 --> 16:08.990
-Refreshments, anybody?
-Ah.

16:09.074 --> 16:12.869
And to think we always had
such high hopes
for you and Chester!

16:14.037 --> 16:17.207
-Mother!
-I think she had
a lucky escape.

16:17.290 --> 16:19.667
You know,
I think you may be right.

16:19.751 --> 16:21.002
Courage.

16:24.464 --> 16:26.049
Steady on, Funnybunny.

16:35.558 --> 16:39.771
(SOFTLY) Luce, I want you to
book the Porsche into the
garage tomorrow morning.

16:39.854 --> 16:43.400
Your father heard the rattle.
He's deaf and he heard it.

16:43.483 --> 16:46.820
Hasn't anyone ever told
you young ones
it's very rude to whisper?

16:46.903 --> 16:48.154
Oh, sorry.

16:48.238 --> 16:49.823
Aren't we, Funnybunny?

16:54.744 --> 16:56.663
Where have you been?

16:56.746 --> 16:59.541
Chester's being...
You know what Chester's like
when he's being competitive,

16:59.624 --> 17:01.042
Mummy's going on
about me and Chester

17:01.126 --> 17:02.961
and Daddy keeps calling me
Funnybunny.

17:03.044 --> 17:05.171
-Funnybunny?
-Don't you dare.

17:05.255 --> 17:08.465
Well, you can imagine,
count it as one of
the greatest days of my life.

17:08.550 --> 17:12.429
Typical Italian,
all dazzle and high emotions.

17:12.512 --> 17:16.307
Four Alfa Romeos, like that.
Four of them,
working as a team,

17:16.391 --> 17:19.352
trying to squeeze me out
and protect their lead driver.
Now...

17:19.435 --> 17:22.105
Vroom, vroom,
this is me here,
vroom, vroom.

17:22.188 --> 17:23.857
I may not have been
a pretty sight,

17:23.940 --> 17:26.151
but I had the speed.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.777
I saw the gap
and went for it...

17:27.861 --> 17:29.487
-(GLASS SHATTERS)
-CECLIA: Oh!

17:29.571 --> 17:31.781
-I think we'd better
get on with dinner.
-Yeah.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.919
I've led two of your sisters
up the aisle, old girl,
and I'm about to lead a third.

17:46.253 --> 17:48.589
-Am I to lose you as well?
-Daddy!

17:50.424 --> 17:51.593
What do you think of him?

18:04.189 --> 18:06.064
Scraps and sprats. Splendid.

18:06.149 --> 18:07.275
Ah... (LAUGHS)

18:07.984 --> 18:09.652
Come along.

18:09.735 --> 18:10.862
Lucy.

18:21.206 --> 18:22.874
And it's Rob Roy Brodie.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.126
The loser.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.087
It's your round, Ewan.

18:29.214 --> 18:30.298
Zoe,

18:30.381 --> 18:31.591
same again, please.

18:45.105 --> 18:46.356
Dinner for six.

18:51.069 --> 18:52.946
You can't afford to
keep on losing, Ewan.

19:02.497 --> 19:03.623
Nice.

19:04.749 --> 19:06.042
(CLAPPING)

19:09.170 --> 19:11.256
Bit of a step up
from the sergeants' mess, hmm?

19:12.257 --> 19:13.341
You could say that.

19:18.763 --> 19:20.557
You served with the Paras?

19:26.479 --> 19:27.564
Yes.

19:35.989 --> 19:38.450
Blotted your copybook, though,
Bowman, didn't you?

19:40.618 --> 19:41.953
(TSKING)

19:42.871 --> 19:43.955
It's a long story.

19:44.706 --> 19:45.874
Yes.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.501
It always is.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.965
Absent without leave.

19:56.885 --> 19:59.846
Six months in Colchester
military prison.

20:01.681 --> 20:04.392
-You've done time?
-Who hasn't?

20:04.476 --> 20:06.227
Military prison.
Entirely different.

20:07.437 --> 20:09.814
Come on then, Colonel.

20:09.898 --> 20:13.735
This is a gentleman's game,
sir, not a ruddy game
of football.

20:13.818 --> 20:15.737
Been digging into my past,
have you, Colonel?

20:21.785 --> 20:23.078
Lucy's my youngest.

20:24.162 --> 20:25.163
She's very important to me.

20:25.789 --> 20:26.831
She is to me.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.834
Then you'll understand
my concerns.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.797
You needn't be concerned
about Lucy.

20:37.634 --> 20:38.927
I hope you're right.

20:47.936 --> 20:50.271
-Does Lucy know?
-About your past?

20:50.355 --> 20:51.356
About your digging?

20:54.609 --> 20:56.820
-Lucky.
-Good shot.

20:56.903 --> 20:59.239
I don't think we need
to trouble Lucy, do you?

21:11.584 --> 21:13.044
What are your intentions,
Bowman?

21:16.172 --> 21:18.216
It's early days yet, Colonel.

21:18.299 --> 21:19.634
The girl's very taken
with you.

21:21.636 --> 21:22.762
The feeling's mutual.

21:23.721 --> 21:24.973
Are you quite sure about that?

21:28.017 --> 21:31.020
I think Lucy
understands the situation.

21:31.104 --> 21:33.898
Yes, but what is
the situation?

21:33.982 --> 21:36.359
Maybe you should have
dug a little deeper, Colonel.

21:40.822 --> 21:42.031
Yes!

21:43.616 --> 21:45.952
My game, I think.

21:46.035 --> 21:48.872
You've done pretty well
for an NCO, Bowman,
I'll allow you that.

21:48.955 --> 21:52.292
You even make
a passable laird.
Thank you.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.753
-It's almost as though
you were born to it.
-He was.

21:56.463 --> 21:57.630
Quite.

22:10.101 --> 22:11.269
JESS: Hello?

22:11.936 --> 22:13.021
Dad?

22:32.791 --> 22:33.875
Dad?

22:37.504 --> 22:38.505
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

23:04.531 --> 23:06.491
-Morning.
-Morning.

23:11.704 --> 23:14.749
Your father seems to be
under the impression

23:16.167 --> 23:18.002
there might be another
wedding on the cards.

23:19.462 --> 23:20.505
Ah.

23:27.345 --> 23:28.721
What's going on, Lucy?

23:29.722 --> 23:31.766
Well... You see,

23:31.850 --> 23:35.228
I do get rather fed up
of Mummy going on about

23:36.604 --> 23:39.274
how Hetty and Helen
and now Heather

23:39.357 --> 23:41.484
have bagged themselves
such lovely husbands.

23:41.568 --> 23:45.321
And my father pointing out
that at least I don't have
to worry about that

23:45.405 --> 23:47.490
because, well, I'm not really
marriage material, am I?

23:48.742 --> 23:51.703
So I...may have misled them,

23:52.579 --> 23:55.039
a tiny bit.

23:57.459 --> 23:58.626
Sorry.

24:04.632 --> 24:06.092
Did he give you
the third degree?

24:06.176 --> 24:08.386
-You could say that.
-Mmm, poor you.

24:08.470 --> 24:10.555
-I coped.
-I knew you would.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.351
So, dinner tonight
at Chester's, then.

24:15.435 --> 24:17.604
I've just about had my fill
of your boss.

24:17.687 --> 24:19.814
No, no, no,
he's not gonna be there.

24:19.898 --> 24:21.775
He's planning his lunge
at Isobel.

24:23.777 --> 24:25.111
-Is he now?
-Mmm.

24:25.195 --> 24:27.906
So it'll just be you, me,
Mummy and Daddy.

24:27.989 --> 24:30.992
A chance for you and Daddy
to build some bridges
before the wedding,

24:31.076 --> 24:32.786
Heather's wedding.

24:35.163 --> 24:36.706
Yeah, maybe you're right.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.460
See you tonight, then.

24:41.628 --> 24:42.629
Come here.

24:50.512 --> 24:51.721
Would it be so awful?

24:53.473 --> 24:55.350
What?

24:55.433 --> 24:58.937
(STAMMERS) Well, you know...
I mean...
We've got loads of time

24:59.020 --> 25:03.108
before we have to
even start thinking
about anything like that,

25:03.191 --> 25:04.567
really, don't we? Yeah.

25:05.110 --> 25:06.194
Bye.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.168
-Mum in?
-Aye.

25:26.506 --> 25:27.882
EWAN: You knew?

25:27.966 --> 25:30.718
Your father and I
have been leading
separate lives.

25:30.802 --> 25:32.220
You as well?

25:32.303 --> 25:35.098
-Have you been doing
what he's been doing?
-No.

25:35.181 --> 25:38.726
We're a family, right?
You, me and Dad.

25:38.810 --> 25:41.062
We'll always be
a family, Ewan.

25:41.146 --> 25:43.314
This is what I think, right?

25:43.398 --> 25:46.609
What you need is a holiday.
Just the two of you.

25:46.693 --> 25:47.861
I mean, Dad's
always been on the road

25:47.944 --> 25:49.571
since we moved up here,
or so he says.

25:51.364 --> 25:53.533
You can go somewhere nice
and sort yourselves out.

25:53.616 --> 25:55.827
I'll look after the house.
It'll be a second honeymoon.

25:55.910 --> 25:57.412
We've been talking
about separating.

26:01.499 --> 26:03.543
Divorce?

26:03.626 --> 26:05.920
-You'd leave Mum for her?
-Liza.

26:07.255 --> 26:08.381
She has a name.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.469
So, how long
youse been leading
these separate lives, eh?

26:14.763 --> 26:15.805
A couple of years.

26:16.431 --> 26:18.266
You lied to me.

26:18.349 --> 26:20.435
For two years, you made me
play happy family.

26:20.518 --> 26:23.229
-We didn't want to hurt you.
-You got that wrong,
didn't you, Dad?

26:23.313 --> 26:25.356
Your dad's moving back
to Glasgow.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.400
You can come down
and stay any time.

26:27.484 --> 26:28.902
And I'm staying here.

26:28.985 --> 26:30.320
You'll have two homes.

26:31.488 --> 26:32.697
So, no holiday, then.

26:47.545 --> 26:49.172
All right?

26:49.255 --> 26:50.423
I've never done
one of these before.

26:51.549 --> 26:53.176
Very nice.

26:53.259 --> 26:56.471
Very expensive, too, mate.
It's a job for your boss,
I reckon.

26:56.554 --> 26:57.597
That'll be my dad.

26:59.224 --> 27:00.725
Well, it shouldn't be
too much of a stretch,

27:00.809 --> 27:02.394
you know,
it's just a little rattle.

27:04.646 --> 27:07.315
-Is he about?
-No, he's banger racing.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.151
There you are.

27:13.321 --> 27:14.781
Courtesy car.

27:18.326 --> 27:19.786
It's all right,

27:19.869 --> 27:21.871
except the radio doesn't work.

27:21.955 --> 27:23.873
If you come back in an hour,
I can let you have the Sierra.

27:23.957 --> 27:25.792
No, no. It's perfect.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.696
-Hiya.
-Come down in the world,
haven't you?

27:54.779 --> 27:57.824
-Courtesy car.
-Read the
trade descriptions, mate?

27:57.907 --> 28:00.618
I like it. It's earthy,
uncomplicated,

28:00.702 --> 28:03.037
-in touch with nature.
-Mmm.

28:03.121 --> 28:04.414
Are you busy?

28:04.497 --> 28:07.167
-Yeah, I am, actually.
-Good, I'll give you a hand.

28:50.126 --> 28:51.252
There you are.

28:53.421 --> 28:55.757
Do you ever get
lonely out here?

28:55.840 --> 28:58.218
No, not now that
Jess has moved in.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.345
Oh, no, well, you know.

29:00.428 --> 29:02.180
I mean, Lucy's great, too.

29:02.263 --> 29:05.016
I don't know what I'd do
without her, but it's not,

29:05.100 --> 29:07.685
you know,
real companionship, is it?

29:07.769 --> 29:09.104
Have you tried the small ads?

29:10.939 --> 29:13.316
Joke. Ha, ha, ha.

29:16.236 --> 29:17.237
What, um...

29:18.655 --> 29:20.782
What exactly does Lucy do?

29:20.865 --> 29:22.242
She keeps me
on the straight and narrow.

29:23.618 --> 29:25.245
It was her idea
to move out here.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.454
It was the saving of me.

29:27.622 --> 29:28.706
Yeah, me too.

29:30.417 --> 29:33.878
I... I had a heart condition
a while back. I had surgery.

29:35.088 --> 29:37.173
Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea.

29:37.257 --> 29:39.008
I don't normally
talk about it.

29:39.092 --> 29:41.261
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Course not.

29:42.846 --> 29:44.180
Sorry, Chester,
I've got to get on.

29:48.768 --> 29:50.562
I nearly died on the table.

29:50.645 --> 29:51.855
So they tell me.

29:52.856 --> 29:54.149
Touch and go.

29:55.942 --> 29:58.236
Up till then, I...

29:58.319 --> 29:59.863
I knew the price of everything
and the

30:00.822 --> 30:01.823
value of nothing.

30:02.991 --> 30:04.409
All that's changed now.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.248
How about a drink
with me this evening?

30:12.625 --> 30:15.587
Sorry, Chester,
I was kind of planning
an early night tonight.

30:15.670 --> 30:16.755
Another time, though, eh?

30:20.592 --> 30:26.014
It's just that Lucy's
having Paul round to dinner
with her parents

30:26.097 --> 30:29.684
and I don't really fancy being
a gooseberry in my own house.

30:29.768 --> 30:31.144
Do you know what?

30:31.227 --> 30:32.562
I would love to have
a drink with you tonight.

30:33.730 --> 30:35.940
-Oh, all right, then.
-Good.

30:38.943 --> 30:40.779
You're in danger
of becoming a regular.

30:42.697 --> 30:43.823
So, did you get the sack?

30:45.075 --> 30:46.743
No.

30:46.826 --> 30:49.037
My dad's going back
to Glasgow.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.207
-Glasgow, that's great.
-It's not.

31:01.549 --> 31:04.052
Drink up, Ewan.
We're going for a drive.

31:04.135 --> 31:07.263
-I think he might be
in enough trouble as it is.
-As if.

31:07.347 --> 31:08.681
Come on,
this is gonna be good.

31:08.765 --> 31:11.059
Ewan, I get off in 20 minutes.

31:11.142 --> 31:13.478
Aye, and he'll know where
to find you. Come on.

31:17.107 --> 31:18.149
See you later on.

31:34.958 --> 31:36.084
(SIREN WAILING)

31:38.378 --> 31:40.755
Oh, boys, we've got company!

31:40.839 --> 31:42.215
I really don't need this, man.

31:53.643 --> 31:55.019
(SIREN WAILING)

31:58.148 --> 31:59.274
Miles away.

32:02.152 --> 32:03.278
Come on, Ewan.

32:11.911 --> 32:13.246
Look, man, slow down.

32:13.329 --> 32:15.457
Be quiet, Ewan.
Stop being so dramatic.

32:18.376 --> 32:19.377
(MOUTHING)

32:20.503 --> 32:22.380
-Get out the way!
-(HONKING)

32:23.715 --> 32:24.716
(TYRES SCREECHING)

32:43.068 --> 32:45.278
-Well, well, well.
-It's not what it looks like.

32:46.446 --> 32:48.281
Oh, never is, laddie.

33:01.503 --> 33:02.670
(PHONE RINGING)

33:02.754 --> 33:03.963
Please don't be Paul.
Please don't be Paul.

33:04.047 --> 33:06.091
Ewan, where the hell are you?

33:06.174 --> 33:09.302
Paul, um, could I speak
to Donald, please?

33:09.385 --> 33:11.763
It's a matter
of a highly personal nature.

33:14.182 --> 33:16.309
Donald! Phone!

33:16.392 --> 33:17.936
I'm not in.

33:18.019 --> 33:20.438
-It's Ewan.
-Oh?

33:20.522 --> 33:22.482
A matter of a highly
personal nature.

33:35.954 --> 33:38.623
-All clear.
-I need help.

33:38.706 --> 33:39.833
Help? (CHUCKLES)

34:32.719 --> 34:34.888
Good evening.

34:34.971 --> 34:37.098
I've come to collect
one Ewan Brodie

34:37.181 --> 34:39.184
whom I believe you're
holding in your cells.

34:39.934 --> 34:41.101
Oh.

34:41.186 --> 34:42.603
Ewan Brodie?

34:43.772 --> 34:45.190
Er, yes.

34:45.273 --> 34:46.524
Let me see.

34:47.942 --> 34:49.735
Ah, yes.

34:49.819 --> 34:53.072
And how did you get here,
Mr MacDonald?

34:54.324 --> 34:57.034
I... I flew. Yes.

34:57.118 --> 35:01.206
My ruddy great Fokker's
parked outside
on a double yellow line.

35:01.289 --> 35:03.124
How do you think I got here?

35:05.835 --> 35:07.504
May I see
your pilot's licence?

35:08.630 --> 35:09.756
Uh...

35:28.983 --> 35:30.568
Evening.

35:30.652 --> 35:31.986
Aren't you supposed to be
somewhere?

35:32.070 --> 35:33.488
Not for another
couple of hours.

35:33.570 --> 35:34.989
I was just passing.
How's it going?

35:36.198 --> 35:38.118
There's something wrong
with Smokey.

35:38.201 --> 35:40.954
I can't get Lucy on the phone.
The vet's up in Inverness.

35:41.037 --> 35:42.080
All I've got is this.

35:42.996 --> 35:44.165
What's wrong with him?

35:45.125 --> 35:48.336
Sweating, pawing the ground...

35:50.380 --> 35:51.839
Abdominal pains?

35:51.923 --> 35:53.758
Oh, he's always
in some sort of pain.

35:54.967 --> 35:56.386
Does he want to lie down?

35:56.468 --> 35:58.095
I don't know,
I'll ask him, shall I?

36:01.723 --> 36:03.560
It could be colic.

36:03.643 --> 36:07.897
But if it is colic,
he mustn't be allowed
to lie down.

36:07.980 --> 36:10.400
If he lies down and twists
his gut, it could be fatal.

36:11.735 --> 36:13.611
You'll have to
keep him walking.

36:13.694 --> 36:15.279
And while I'm walking him,

36:15.363 --> 36:18.991
if he decides to lie down,
how am I supposed
to stop him on my own?

36:19.075 --> 36:20.660
Well, you're not on your own,
are you?

37:08.333 --> 37:09.793
ISOBEL: Keep walking.

37:09.876 --> 37:11.419
-There.
-(SNORTS)

37:11.503 --> 37:13.421
Good boy.

37:13.505 --> 37:15.048
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Oh, poor thing.

37:16.091 --> 37:17.300
So when's the wedding?

37:18.176 --> 37:20.136
In a couple of weeks.

37:20.220 --> 37:22.055
You kept that mighty quiet.

37:22.138 --> 37:24.516
(CHUCKLES)
Well, it's not a secret.

37:24.599 --> 37:28.895
Well, I only found out
'cause Jess and I saw Lucy
going into Bessie's Brides.

37:28.978 --> 37:31.898
Yeah, well, she's gonna be
chief bridesmaid
at her sister's wedding.

37:31.981 --> 37:33.149
So it's not you and Lucy?

37:33.233 --> 37:36.569
What? No.

37:36.653 --> 37:39.030
-Oh, I see.
-Yeah, well, I wish
everyone else did.

37:39.697 --> 37:40.740
Come on.

37:42.325 --> 37:44.369
(PHONE RINGING)

37:53.420 --> 37:55.839
He's on his way.
Well, there's no answer,
so that must be it.

37:55.922 --> 37:59.592
-Unless, of course,
something awful's happened.
-That must be it, dear.

37:59.676 --> 38:01.761
-Something awful?
-No, Daddy.

38:02.971 --> 38:05.348
Well, I like your Mr Bowman.

38:05.432 --> 38:06.474
(GRUMBLING)

38:30.165 --> 38:31.166
(SIGHS)

38:33.585 --> 38:36.880
No, what Lucy and I have
is good.

38:36.963 --> 38:39.716
I enjoy being with her,
but... (CHUCKLES)

38:39.799 --> 38:42.218
As for everyone
trying to marry us off,
I mean...

38:45.513 --> 38:46.973
That is a serious commitment.

38:48.016 --> 38:49.476
I mean, you've got to be sure.

38:50.685 --> 38:52.103
-And you're not?
-No.

38:53.271 --> 38:54.731
Well, not yet anyway.

38:58.318 --> 39:00.236
Paul, if you've got to go,
I'll be all right on my own.

39:03.156 --> 39:05.867
Nah, I'm sure
Lucy will understand.
Come on. (CLICKS TONGUE)

39:12.165 --> 39:15.251
Isobel, do you regret
leaving Edinburgh?

39:15.877 --> 39:17.629
No.

39:17.712 --> 39:20.757
I didn't realise it
at the time, but this is
all I ever wanted.

39:22.926 --> 39:25.929
Yeah, but... How did you know
for sure?

39:27.847 --> 39:29.766
Considered the alternatives
and...

39:31.851 --> 39:32.852
Just knew.

39:35.897 --> 39:37.190
Maybe that's what I should do.

39:41.277 --> 39:43.196
I'm supposed to be having
a drink with Chester tonight.

39:44.656 --> 39:46.032
He'll keep.

40:07.345 --> 40:08.972
Does he have a cook,
your Mr Bowman?

40:09.055 --> 40:10.390
Yes. Ewan.

40:10.473 --> 40:11.891
I'd hang onto him
if I were you.

40:15.103 --> 40:17.188
Seems to make a habit
of going AWOL.

40:17.272 --> 40:20.108
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation
for his being late.

40:20.191 --> 40:21.609
Paul wouldn't just not show.

40:21.693 --> 40:22.986
He knows that
we're expecting him and...

40:23.069 --> 40:25.363
Full stop, comma, dear.

40:25.447 --> 40:28.241
You can see why we
worry about you, Funnybunny.

40:28.324 --> 40:30.368
I'm not a baby any more,
Daddy, and please

40:31.953 --> 40:33.747
stop calling me Funnybunny.

40:33.830 --> 40:35.832
(GRUMBLING)

40:37.167 --> 40:38.334
Quite right.

40:41.045 --> 40:43.465
Mummy and I have been talking
and we think...

40:44.340 --> 40:46.384
I think

40:46.468 --> 40:47.927
you should come back
home with us.

40:48.011 --> 40:51.556
And I think you should
hold onto your Mr Bowman.

40:51.639 --> 40:53.183
With Heather about to leave,

40:53.266 --> 40:55.852
we'll be rattling about
in that great big house
all on our own.

40:55.935 --> 40:57.312
I don't rattle.

41:00.648 --> 41:02.484
We've never really been
together, have we, Lucy?

41:04.486 --> 41:06.863
You away at boarding school

41:06.946 --> 41:09.282
and Mummy and me
sent to all four corners
of the world.

41:11.409 --> 41:12.827
We can make up for lost time.

41:15.997 --> 41:17.791
As for that Bowman fellow...

41:17.874 --> 41:19.250
May I leave the table?

41:19.334 --> 41:21.211
You've hardly touched a thing.

41:21.294 --> 41:22.796
I'm really not hungry.

41:26.883 --> 41:28.051
Extraordinary.

41:41.564 --> 41:42.649
Meg?

41:45.777 --> 41:47.112
Oh... Sorry.

41:50.990 --> 41:52.325
(MUMBLES)

41:52.992 --> 41:54.494
Oh, Dad...

42:01.042 --> 42:04.629
Well, I suppose
a lot of my friends were
from single-parent families.

42:04.712 --> 42:06.047
I was one of the lucky ones.

42:07.173 --> 42:09.050
I had a mum and dad.

42:10.385 --> 42:13.763
You still do, old son.

42:13.847 --> 42:16.724
You've just discovered
your parents have got
feet of clay, that's all.

42:18.017 --> 42:20.145
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

42:20.228 --> 42:23.481
Families come
in all shapes and sizes.

42:23.565 --> 42:26.651
Take that motley selection
at Glenbogle.

42:26.735 --> 42:28.903
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

42:29.904 --> 42:30.989
We muddle along.

42:32.532 --> 42:34.784
And I've spent most of my life
away from them.

42:36.953 --> 42:38.204
There's a source of regret.

42:39.914 --> 42:42.167
Don't make the same mistake,
there's a good chap.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.336
So what should I do?

42:45.420 --> 42:47.255
Oh, go back home

42:48.673 --> 42:50.425
and tell them you understand.

42:50.508 --> 42:51.593
But I don't.

42:52.093 --> 42:53.094
Oh...

42:54.929 --> 42:57.182
We make a fine pair.

42:59.893 --> 43:03.730
You banged up for car theft
and me for breaking my curfew.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.024
Feet of clay, Donald.

43:06.107 --> 43:07.192
Yes.

43:08.777 --> 43:11.112
I could have been halfway
to London by now.

43:11.196 --> 43:13.239
So why did you come back?

43:13.323 --> 43:17.452
Well, I could hardly leave
you here to rot in this
miserable stalag, could I?

43:17.535 --> 43:18.912
I've got you into trouble,
haven't I?

43:21.039 --> 43:23.583
They'd have caught up with me
anyway, sooner or later.

43:25.376 --> 43:26.419
They lied to me.

43:33.218 --> 43:34.803
Perhaps they were
trying to protect you.

43:36.179 --> 43:37.222
Yeah, right.

43:43.269 --> 43:44.938
He should be all right
in the next couple of days.

43:46.106 --> 43:48.441
-Thanks, Rory.
-Keep an eye on him.

43:48.525 --> 43:50.110
Any problems,
you know where to find me.

43:51.569 --> 43:53.029
-Good night.
-Night. Thanks.

43:53.113 --> 43:54.364
Night.

43:54.447 --> 43:56.157
(SIGHS) So that's it, then.

43:58.118 --> 43:59.285
Too late for dinner.

44:00.620 --> 44:01.621
(SIGHS)

44:08.753 --> 44:11.881
I thought we made
a great team, you and I.

44:11.965 --> 44:14.634
-The horse whisperers
of Glenbogle.
-(CHUCKLE)

44:18.555 --> 44:20.473
I never had you down
as a team player, Isobel.

44:21.850 --> 44:23.351
I could be
with the right person.

44:28.481 --> 44:29.566
And who might that be?

44:34.988 --> 44:36.614
I once thought you and I,
maybe.

44:42.787 --> 44:44.247
Bit late for that now,
I suppose.

44:53.923 --> 44:55.133
-Lucy.
-I saw the vet.

44:57.510 --> 45:00.054
Um, I'm sorry about dinner.

45:00.138 --> 45:01.639
Paul had to help me
with Smokey,

45:01.723 --> 45:03.433
I couldn't have done it
without him.

45:03.516 --> 45:04.684
I should have phoned.

45:06.978 --> 45:08.063
It would have been kind.

45:19.032 --> 45:20.742
-GOLLY: Early start.
-I know what
you've been doing.

45:23.119 --> 45:24.871
I found the map

45:24.954 --> 45:26.247
and the list of Meg's friends.

45:26.331 --> 45:28.041
You had no right
going through my things.

45:28.124 --> 45:30.335
-I was worried about you.
-Told you I can take care
of myself.

45:31.044 --> 45:32.087
I followed you.

45:34.839 --> 45:36.007
What?

45:36.091 --> 45:37.133
Last night.

45:45.850 --> 45:47.227
I saw you stop that woman.

45:49.813 --> 45:50.855
I'm sorry.

45:53.316 --> 45:54.609
Aw, Jess.

45:58.154 --> 46:02.534
If the truth be told
I didn't think
I'd ever find her.

46:02.617 --> 46:05.662
It was better than lying
in my bed night after night,
staring at the ceiling.

46:08.164 --> 46:11.209
So I went to see friends

46:11.292 --> 46:13.253
she'd mentioned,
places she'd taught at.

46:14.921 --> 46:16.423
I thought that if I could

46:16.506 --> 46:18.591
bump into her when she was
least expecting it that...

46:20.427 --> 46:21.761
Why didn't you tell me?

46:21.845 --> 46:24.180
(SCOFFS) Because you'd have
thought me an old fool.

46:25.849 --> 46:27.600
And you'd rather I thought
you a randy teenager?

46:28.601 --> 46:29.602
Every time, lass.

46:32.313 --> 46:33.398
Oh, Dad...

46:40.196 --> 46:42.532
-I still think
you're an old fool.
-Mmm.

46:44.409 --> 46:46.161
That offer to cook supper,

46:46.244 --> 46:47.495
does it still, still hold?

46:47.579 --> 46:48.621
Mmm-hmm. If you like.

46:49.164 --> 46:50.790
-I do.
-When?

46:50.874 --> 46:52.041
Whenever.

46:52.125 --> 46:53.877
I'm not going anywhere,
not any more.

46:55.879 --> 46:58.131
If Meg wanted to see me,
she knew where to find me.

47:00.049 --> 47:01.176
It's over.

47:01.968 --> 47:03.428
-Are you sure?
-Mmm.

47:04.929 --> 47:06.222
I'm sure.

47:07.557 --> 47:09.476
-Oh, Dad.
-Oh, lass.

47:11.853 --> 47:14.064
Turns out it was
one of Lucy's hairgrips.

47:14.147 --> 47:16.024
I'm not talking to her.

47:16.107 --> 47:19.569
Speaking of whom, I wouldn't
like to be in your shoes.

47:19.652 --> 47:21.071
Not when the Colonel
catches up with you.

47:22.655 --> 47:24.324
You're enjoying all this,
aren't you, Chester?

47:24.407 --> 47:25.825
Watching a grown man grovel?

47:25.909 --> 47:27.577
(LAUGHS) Yes.

47:29.162 --> 47:30.455
Oh, um...

47:30.538 --> 47:32.332
Whilst I'm grovelling,

47:32.415 --> 47:34.709
I suppose I ought to apologise

47:34.793 --> 47:37.212
for queering your pitch
with Isobel last night.

47:37.295 --> 47:40.090
It's all right. I hadn't
planned anything special.

47:40.173 --> 47:42.342
Well, that's all right, then.

47:42.425 --> 47:45.470
I'll leave you
to your wayward staff
and delinquent uncle then.

47:45.553 --> 47:47.347
(ENGINE STARTING)

47:47.430 --> 47:50.433
Well, it looks like
you're stuck with me
for another year.

47:50.517 --> 47:52.352
Well, we'll uh...

47:52.435 --> 47:54.396
We'll have to make the
best of it, then, won't we?

47:54.479 --> 47:55.814
Yes, we'll muddle along.

47:56.731 --> 47:58.024
Take it easy on the boy.

47:58.108 --> 47:59.692
He's having a hard enough time
as it is.

48:03.279 --> 48:04.823
-Ewan.
-Boss.

48:06.199 --> 48:08.660
Chester's not pressing
charges.

48:08.743 --> 48:10.995
When they got you out
they found this,

48:11.079 --> 48:13.289
one of Lucy's hairgrips,
that was causing the rattle.

48:14.999 --> 48:16.042
And your mother phoned.

48:17.627 --> 48:19.003
They're worried sick
about you.

48:19.087 --> 48:20.547
Bit late for that, isn't it?

48:20.630 --> 48:22.382
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Paul, I tried.

48:24.217 --> 48:25.760
So, what are you gonna do?

48:25.844 --> 48:28.972
They're the ones that
have messed up. Not me.

48:29.055 --> 48:31.558
It's time you started thinking
about the consequences
of your actions.

48:31.641 --> 48:34.018
-Like what?
-Like messing around
in someone else's car

48:34.102 --> 48:35.770
and ending up in here.

48:35.854 --> 48:38.565
Like asking Donald for help
and landing him with
another years' curfew.

48:43.153 --> 48:45.447
Ewan,

48:45.530 --> 48:47.741
your parents are having
a hard enough time as it is,

48:47.824 --> 48:49.117
whatever they might tell you.

48:51.119 --> 48:53.246
The last thing they need is
to think they've lost you.

48:57.041 --> 48:58.126
Time to grow up, eh?

48:59.252 --> 49:00.295
You sound like Donald.

49:01.546 --> 49:03.131
-Donald.
-(ENGINE STARTING)

49:03.214 --> 49:04.215
Donald.

49:05.717 --> 49:07.010
Okay, Okay, Okay.

49:08.678 --> 49:10.180
Thank you.

49:10.263 --> 49:12.015
Look, I'm going to get round
and try to sort things out.

49:12.098 --> 49:13.558
Good man. Hey...

49:15.101 --> 49:16.603
Can you drive this thing?

49:16.686 --> 49:19.147
I've never...

49:19.230 --> 49:22.650
Take it easy on the clutch,
there's a good chap.

49:42.754 --> 49:44.130
You're packing?

49:44.214 --> 49:45.256
Just making a start.

49:46.966 --> 49:48.301
-I'll put the kettle on.
-No...

49:49.219 --> 49:50.345
Please,

49:51.221 --> 49:52.263
I want you to stay.

49:54.766 --> 49:56.684
I've just come
to say that, um...

49:58.561 --> 49:59.938
-Ewan?
-I'm fine.

50:03.733 --> 50:05.318
I've just come to say that...

50:06.111 --> 50:07.112
It's up to you,

50:08.113 --> 50:09.531
both of you,

50:09.614 --> 50:10.657
what you want.

50:11.533 --> 50:13.618
And if, um,

50:13.701 --> 50:15.745
you're no longer happy
being married,

50:19.624 --> 50:20.750
it's okay with me.

50:23.169 --> 50:24.379
We're still a family.

50:25.296 --> 50:26.339
I'm proud of you, Son.

50:27.424 --> 50:28.633
EWAN: Aye, well...

50:30.844 --> 50:32.595
Will I see you before you go?

50:37.350 --> 50:38.643
We're still going
to the match, right?

50:39.561 --> 50:40.603
If you want to.

50:42.605 --> 50:43.648
What do you think?

50:51.573 --> 50:53.825
-Hi.
-Hi.

50:53.908 --> 50:55.952
Thank you for looking after
Smokey last night

50:57.537 --> 51:01.332
and I'm sorry
if I was a bit...short.

51:01.416 --> 51:03.668
No. No, I should have phoned.

51:04.377 --> 51:05.879
Bowman!

51:05.962 --> 51:08.339
We're on our way
to the station.

51:08.423 --> 51:09.883
They wanted to say goodbye.

51:11.301 --> 51:13.303
PAUL: Colonel. Mrs Ford.

51:13.386 --> 51:15.013
Poor show last night.

51:15.096 --> 51:17.140
Lucy cooked up
a marvellous dinner.

51:17.223 --> 51:20.810
-I apologise, Colonel.
-All to do with that
blessed horse.

51:20.894 --> 51:22.103
Yes, Lucy did mention it.

51:22.187 --> 51:23.646
You will show
for the wedding, I take it?

51:23.730 --> 51:25.190
-It's all right, Daddy.
-Yeah, I'll deal with this,
Lucy.

51:25.273 --> 51:26.524
I said it's all right.

51:26.608 --> 51:28.735
Daddy does usually
know best, dear.

51:31.821 --> 51:33.740
Why don't we let Lucy
speak for herself?

51:37.660 --> 51:39.996
-He may not want to come.
-Nonsense.

51:40.080 --> 51:43.416
I'll discuss it
with Paul later,
when we're on our own.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.836
And as for coming back home
with you and Mummy,

51:46.920 --> 51:49.714
I'm sorry, Daddy,
but my life is here for now.

51:54.385 --> 51:55.720
Of course it is, dear.

51:57.972 --> 52:01.476
And it doesn't make me
any less of a daughter to you.

52:01.559 --> 52:03.645
And I'll always love you both
very much.

52:06.523 --> 52:08.691
And we'll always
love you, dear.
Bowman, a word.

52:15.532 --> 52:18.410
Well, now you've tasted
a real car,

52:18.493 --> 52:20.662
I suppose you'd like to give
the Morgan a spin.

52:21.871 --> 52:22.997
Are you serious?

52:23.081 --> 52:24.165
No, joking.

52:25.417 --> 52:26.501
Of course not, Donald.

52:28.044 --> 52:29.587
(LAUGHING)

52:29.671 --> 52:31.798
-A word of warning...
-I know, take it easy
on the clutch.

52:31.881 --> 52:34.592
No, no,
it doesn't have a clutch!

52:34.676 --> 52:36.386
Stick to one girl at a time.

52:36.469 --> 52:37.595
Ready, and...

52:41.266 --> 52:42.308
Yes!

52:43.560 --> 52:44.644
(ENGINE REVVING)

52:44.728 --> 52:46.146
Oh, ho-ho!

52:46.229 --> 52:47.313
(DONALD LAUGHING)

52:48.314 --> 52:49.357
Oh!

52:51.484 --> 52:52.944
She's very fond of you.

52:53.027 --> 52:54.112
Very fond.

52:57.115 --> 52:59.242
And she's certainly found
her spirit.

52:59.325 --> 53:01.578
No small thanks to you,
I imagine.

53:01.661 --> 53:03.204
Lucy's her own woman, Colonel.

53:03.288 --> 53:05.874
So it would seem.

53:05.957 --> 53:09.586
Mummy and I will be loath
to lose her,
of course we will, but...

53:09.669 --> 53:12.714
She does appear to have
set her heart on you.

53:12.797 --> 53:14.424
Well, like I said, Colonel,
it's...

53:15.633 --> 53:17.218
-It's early days yet.
-Nonsense.

53:18.094 --> 53:19.929
Welcome to the family.

53:20.013 --> 53:22.223
Thank you, Colonel.
