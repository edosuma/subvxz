Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:01.811 --> 00:03.212
He has your arm.

00:03.279 --> 00:05.414
It's hard being apart
from them, isn't it?

00:05.482 --> 00:06.949
Yeah.

00:07.016 --> 00:08.410
I never made
my own friends.

00:08.478 --> 00:10.254
Are you really
my friend, Anna?

00:10.322 --> 00:11.964
Of course I'm your friend.

00:12.031 --> 00:14.270
They killed her--Anna.
They shot her in the head.

00:14.338 --> 00:15.877
She was my friend.

00:15.943 --> 00:18.523
So you're a fighter.
You got skills?

00:18.591 --> 00:19.825
Wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

00:19.893 --> 00:22.465
All I know is I can do
a bunch of stuff.

00:22.533 --> 00:24.535
But I can't remember
how I learned it.

00:24.602 --> 00:26.003
What did you do to me?

00:26.071 --> 00:27.909
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

00:27.977 --> 00:30.381
Yeah, I wouldn't call her
my friend anymore, but thanks.

00:30.449 --> 00:32.516
Nina, your life
is out of control.

00:32.584 --> 00:34.318
I'm tired
of hurting people.

00:34.386 --> 00:36.253
- Nina, no!
- I'm sorry for everything.

00:59.576 --> 01:02.344
Maggie.

01:04.581 --> 01:07.017
That's my sister.

01:09.219 --> 01:11.854
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:11.922 --> 01:14.758
If you follow me,
there's some paperwork.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.861
Yeah.

01:22.335 --> 01:24.404
Adam.

01:31.146 --> 01:33.780
Adam.

01:33.848 --> 01:35.449
Don't you hear that?

01:35.516 --> 01:38.351
Better get you
back to the main office.

01:38.419 --> 01:40.553
Adam, help me.

01:42.490 --> 01:44.958
Adam?
Maggie.

01:45.025 --> 01:46.326
- Adam!
- Maggie!

01:46.393 --> 01:47.628
Adam, help me!

01:47.696 --> 01:49.696
- I need some help here!
- Maggie!

01:49.764 --> 01:50.764
- Help me!
- Maggie!

01:50.832 --> 01:52.666
- Help me, Adam!
- Maggie!

01:52.733 --> 01:54.134
Adam, help me!

01:54.202 --> 01:55.235
Adam!

01:55.303 --> 01:57.638
- Maggie!
- Help me!

02:01.444 --> 02:04.713
- Oh, my God.
- Help me, Adam!

02:04.781 --> 02:07.083
Adam!

02:07.150 --> 02:09.685
Help me, Adam.

02:09.752 --> 02:12.188
Help me.

02:13.558 --> 02:15.692
Adam?
Maggie. Maggie.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.795
- Adam! Adam!
- Maggie!

02:17.862 --> 02:19.597
- Adam!
- No, get off me!

02:19.665 --> 02:20.832
Adam!

02:20.899 --> 02:22.166
Get off me!
She's alive!

02:55.005 --> 02:59.409
Gary's working
through some issues, so...

02:59.477 --> 03:01.545
And I-I thought
it would be easier

03:01.612 --> 03:04.682
for you to find your bearings
without everyone around.

03:07.552 --> 03:09.520
Also, I wanted to find
a quiet moment to speak with you

03:09.588 --> 03:11.623
about something.

03:11.690 --> 03:12.891
I know the drill.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.460
Ready to do the work,
so...

03:15.527 --> 03:17.395
No more pushing.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.897
Uh, yes and--and no, Nina.

03:19.965 --> 03:22.099
Um, I-I thought we'd take
a different approach

03:22.167 --> 03:24.602
to your recovery this time.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.037
I need your help,

03:26.104 --> 03:28.139
but only if you're okay
with this.

03:28.206 --> 03:31.308
Um...

03:31.376 --> 03:35.246
Let me explain, hmm?

03:35.314 --> 03:38.716
The more I learn
of--of Stanton Parish, the--

03:38.784 --> 03:41.887
well, the more
he frightens me.

03:41.954 --> 03:43.422
He's made it very clear to me

03:43.489 --> 03:47.626
that should the path to his
utopia be lined with bodies,

03:47.694 --> 03:49.495
so be it.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.263
An "ends justify the means"
type of guy.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.732
Uh, yes.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.201
And Gary has managed to connect
Parish's family fortune,

03:55.269 --> 03:57.637
which is quite substantial,
to a charity.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.607
It's the Llamrei Foundation.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.943
So what, it's,
like, an evil charity?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.778
No, it appears to be doing
some pretty wonderful work.

04:04.846 --> 04:06.379
But it has also made

04:06.447 --> 04:10.250
some rather sizeable and yet
undisclosed contributions

04:10.318 --> 04:12.886
to our own
New York Senator Burton.

04:12.954 --> 04:15.422
Now, this is
a quid pro quo situation--

04:15.489 --> 04:18.257
She probably wouldn't admit it
if you just asked nicely.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.483
Probably not.

04:20.552 --> 04:23.054
But...

04:23.122 --> 04:26.757
I'm thinking
you could ask her nicely.

04:26.825 --> 04:29.093
I need you to find out
what the senator knows

04:29.161 --> 04:33.798
about Stanton Parish.

04:33.866 --> 04:35.901
This is her schedule.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.670
She'll be in New York
for one more day.

04:43.331 --> 04:44.831
Okay.

04:44.899 --> 04:46.166
Thank you, Nina.

04:53.707 --> 04:55.140
You take two fingers.
You're gonna put it on the seam.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.175
Then you're
gonna draw it back.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.011
Does that make sense, Ty?
I don't know.

04:59.078 --> 05:00.178
Got to go.

05:00.246 --> 05:02.581
I've got practice.
Yeah, okay.

05:02.648 --> 05:04.049
Well, look, we can, uh--we'll
work on your follow-through

05:04.116 --> 05:05.016
when you come out next week.

05:05.084 --> 05:06.484
And guess what.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.385
I got us two tickets
to the Yankees game.

05:08.453 --> 05:11.455
Mom says plans have changed.
I'm not coming to New York.

05:11.523 --> 05:13.090
- Tyler, we got to go.
- What? Why?

05:13.158 --> 05:15.860
Hey, Cameron, he'll give you
a call on Thursday.

05:15.928 --> 05:17.361
He's not coming anymore?

05:17.429 --> 05:20.197
Well, Evan offered to take us
to San Francisco next weekend,

05:20.265 --> 05:22.800
so we're gonna go
to San Francisco.

05:22.868 --> 05:24.302
Well, look, I, uh--

05:24.370 --> 05:27.071
I can come out to Nevada
anytime, you know?

05:27.139 --> 05:29.741
I'll just let you know
when it's a good time, okay?

05:29.809 --> 05:33.010
Yeah, okay.
Uh...

05:33.078 --> 05:34.746
Tell him I said good-bye, okay?

05:34.813 --> 05:36.281
Okay.

05:41.653 --> 05:43.087
Sorry about that.

05:43.155 --> 05:44.321
I wasn't eavesdropping.

05:44.389 --> 05:47.024
I just couldn't help
but overhear.

05:47.091 --> 05:48.492
You know where I was

05:48.560 --> 05:50.928
when Tyler had his first
Little League tryout?

05:50.996 --> 05:53.497
Um...

05:53.565 --> 05:55.566
Me neither.

05:55.634 --> 05:58.269
I was out of my mind drunk.

05:58.336 --> 06:02.306
She's still pissed.
I get it.

06:02.374 --> 06:04.175
I'm not really in a position
to make any demands

06:04.243 --> 06:06.077
after everything
I put them through, you know?

06:06.145 --> 06:07.746
Yeah.

06:07.813 --> 06:09.648
What the hell
happened to you?

06:09.715 --> 06:11.683
Present from my wife.

06:11.751 --> 06:14.019
Yeah, she gets
a little rough, and--

06:14.086 --> 06:15.554
Seriously?

06:15.622 --> 06:17.122
I mean, I just got gutted,

06:17.190 --> 06:21.093
and that's what you're gonna
come back at me with?

06:21.161 --> 06:24.430
All right, listen...

06:24.497 --> 06:26.198
I've been going
to the fight club.

06:26.266 --> 06:27.333
Oh, come on, dude.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.168
No, Hicks,
I got it under control.

06:29.236 --> 06:32.372
It's a rush.
It...

06:32.440 --> 06:36.009
It's good.

06:36.077 --> 06:37.778
I don't like the tie.

06:37.845 --> 06:39.480
It's like a noose.

06:39.547 --> 06:41.215
Nooses kill people.

06:41.283 --> 06:42.917
It's a tombstone
unveiling, Gary.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.919
Men wear ties.
And...

06:44.986 --> 06:46.754
My goodness,
you look great.

06:46.822 --> 06:49.156
Yeah, I know.

06:49.224 --> 06:50.925
I don't think that
this is gonna make me feel

06:50.993 --> 06:52.393
any better, though.

06:52.461 --> 06:54.896
Dr. Rosen says
that I need catharsis.

06:54.963 --> 06:56.831
But I don't think you
can get catharsis

06:56.899 --> 06:58.733
from words on a rock.

06:58.801 --> 07:01.069
Well, it's not a rock.
It's a memorial.

07:01.136 --> 07:02.670
It's not even her words,
you know?

07:02.738 --> 07:03.971
If there are gonna be words,

07:04.039 --> 07:06.274
they should at least be
Anna's words.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.343
Tuck your shirt in.

07:08.410 --> 07:11.746
Oh, Nina.

07:11.814 --> 07:14.582
You bought me this suit.
A year ago.

07:14.650 --> 07:18.053
Well, I didn't buy it,
but, yeah, I remember.

07:18.121 --> 07:19.354
You look great, Gary.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.823
Yeah, I know.

07:20.891 --> 07:22.725
You're a criminal,
but you're not in jail.

07:22.793 --> 07:24.260
She should be in jail,

07:24.328 --> 07:26.796
but apparently Dr. Rosen
thinks we need her.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.364
Oh, so you're
back on the team.

07:28.432 --> 07:30.066
She's not
a part of my team.

07:30.134 --> 07:33.503
Rachel, look, I'm sorry
for what I did to you.

07:33.570 --> 07:35.371
I know my actions hurt
a lot of people--

07:35.439 --> 07:36.773
Please, don't.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.343
I'm not interested.

07:40.411 --> 07:42.079
Come on, Gary.

07:42.146 --> 07:43.914
Come on.

07:45.417 --> 07:47.184
His name is Adam Gordon.

07:47.252 --> 07:48.886
He had been fine
for a long time.

07:48.954 --> 07:50.988
Something must
have triggered this.

07:51.056 --> 07:52.556
Is that what
they're saying?

07:52.624 --> 07:53.991
- Well...
- Where are you going?

07:54.059 --> 07:55.292
Morning.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.294
One of the analysts
flagged a YouTube video

07:57.362 --> 08:00.497
from a hospital security camera
of a former patient of mine.

08:00.565 --> 08:02.165
And then pulled it
immediately.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.801
Got to keep a lid
on this Alpha thing.

08:03.869 --> 08:05.603
Let me know how it goes
with the senator.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.571
Yeah.

08:15.047 --> 08:16.747
Hey!

08:16.815 --> 08:19.116
Valet service at the elevator,
high-class joint you got.

08:19.184 --> 08:20.551
We running
a bed and breakfast now?

08:20.619 --> 08:22.419
I'm just gonna run
a sleep study on Kat tonight,

08:22.487 --> 08:24.421
see if we can figure out
what's going on with her memory.

08:24.488 --> 08:25.488
Uh, I'm sorry.
We have to, uh...

08:25.556 --> 08:26.756
No, it's cool.

08:26.824 --> 08:28.091
You can set yourself up
in my office.

08:28.158 --> 08:29.559
Yeah.

08:29.626 --> 08:31.360
- You know where the kitchen is.
- Yeah, get out of here.

08:36.698 --> 08:39.134
Hello, Senator.

08:39.201 --> 08:42.303
It's a beautiful hotel,
isn't it?

08:42.371 --> 08:44.105
Did you know that
Mayor LaGuardia lived here

08:44.173 --> 08:45.440
in the '30s?

08:45.508 --> 08:47.309
He kept a suite upstairs.

08:47.376 --> 08:50.946
No, Senator, I didn't,
but can I ask you a question?

08:51.014 --> 08:53.716
Mmhmm.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.617
You want to
answer me truthfully.

08:55.685 --> 08:57.419
Of course.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.421
Your campaign received
substantial donations

08:59.489 --> 09:01.623
from the Llamrei Foundation.

09:01.691 --> 09:03.492
Did you do something
for them in return?

09:03.560 --> 09:04.960
Yes.

09:05.028 --> 09:06.828
What exactly?

09:06.896 --> 09:08.295
I can't tell you that.

09:08.363 --> 09:10.660
Yes, you can.

09:10.728 --> 09:12.996
I can't.

09:13.063 --> 09:14.797
It's gone.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.534
Thank you, Senator.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.610
Maggie was alive, Dr. Rosen.
She was begging for my help.

09:31.678 --> 09:34.713
I would have done anything.
No, I understand, Adam.

09:34.780 --> 09:36.681
I know how close you
and your sister always were.

09:36.749 --> 09:38.783
- She was my best friend.
- Mm.

09:41.654 --> 09:43.755
I found out she was using
about six months ago.

09:43.823 --> 09:45.590
Oh, that's a shame.

09:45.658 --> 09:47.392
I figured tough love,
you know?

09:47.459 --> 09:49.193
I'd cut her off.
Maybe she'd clean up.

09:49.261 --> 09:52.263
The important thing
is that your tried, Adam.

09:52.331 --> 09:54.799
Now, listen, intense grief

09:54.866 --> 09:57.601
can often have devastating
effects upon a person.

09:57.669 --> 10:01.204
And we both know that, uh,
your emotions have always been

10:01.272 --> 10:03.639
right at your fingertips...

10:03.707 --> 10:05.607
so to speak.

10:05.675 --> 10:07.443
I'd like to send you
to a clinic

10:07.510 --> 10:10.813
where you can get the kind
of support you need right now...

10:10.881 --> 10:13.949
With your permission,
of course.

10:14.017 --> 10:16.819
Yeah.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.089
Two gentlemen I work with,
a Mr. Harken and a Mr. Hicks,

10:19.156 --> 10:21.023
will escort you there,

10:21.091 --> 10:24.460
uh, once your paperwork
is all filled out.

10:24.528 --> 10:27.263
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

10:30.634 --> 10:32.334
So the orderlies
are bringing him down.

10:32.402 --> 10:34.436
Yes, here are
his medical records.

10:34.504 --> 10:37.373
The paperwork for the transfer
to the clinic is almost done.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.376
Uh, be gentle.
He's been through a lot.

10:40.444 --> 10:41.944
You're not staying?

10:42.012 --> 10:43.979
No, I've got
some pressing business

10:44.047 --> 10:45.348
I need to attend to.

10:45.415 --> 10:47.250
Um, I'll be in touch.

10:58.561 --> 11:02.030
Relax, this has been happening
around these floors lately.

11:03.966 --> 11:05.299
Adam, help me.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.734
Help me!

11:06.802 --> 11:08.369
They're hurting me.
They won't let me out.

11:08.437 --> 11:10.538
Maggie?

11:10.606 --> 11:12.006
Are you okay?

11:12.074 --> 11:14.742
I need to get to Maggie!
I need to get out!

11:14.810 --> 11:16.310
Let me off!

11:16.378 --> 11:19.247
Get off!

11:19.314 --> 11:21.616
Let me out of here!

11:29.124 --> 11:31.225
I need help over here!

11:31.293 --> 11:33.394
Somebody!

In life, Anna never spoke,

12:12.166 --> 12:14.335
but she can speak to us now,

12:14.402 --> 12:16.737
beckoning us
to honor her memory

12:16.805 --> 12:20.041
by living our own lives
in peaceful acceptance

12:20.109 --> 12:21.810
of one another.

12:21.877 --> 12:26.114
Anna is still with us.

12:26.182 --> 12:29.151
She's not with us.
She's dead.

12:29.219 --> 12:32.355
No, Gary, he means in spirit.
She's still with us in spirit.

12:32.423 --> 12:34.791
Anna lives on
in our hearts.

12:34.859 --> 12:37.361
No, she doesn't live on.
That's the--that's the problem.

12:37.429 --> 12:38.562
Gary, shh.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.865
No, well,
why does he get to talk?

12:40.932 --> 12:42.566
He's lying.
We should go. Come on.

12:42.634 --> 12:45.569
Anna wasn't peaceful.
She was a rebel.

12:45.637 --> 12:48.038
Now she's a dead rebel.
Oh, please excuse us.

12:48.106 --> 12:49.940
I'm sorry. This probably
wasn't the best idea.

12:50.008 --> 12:51.708
- No, it was a horrible idea.
- Oh.

12:51.776 --> 12:54.278
- I didn't get any catharsis.
- We should--

12:55.414 --> 12:56.881
Oh.
Your phone's ringing.

12:56.948 --> 12:58.716
- I'm so sorry.
- That's embarrassing for you.

12:58.784 --> 13:00.118
Uh, where do
I put my stone?

13:00.185 --> 13:01.820
This was a beautiful service.
Thank you.

13:09.199 --> 13:11.334
This guy is delusional
and violent.

13:11.402 --> 13:12.769
We need to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

13:12.837 --> 13:13.903
You understand?
Okay. Thanks.

13:13.971 --> 13:15.338
Are they covering the exits?

13:15.406 --> 13:17.908
- Yeah, they got it.
- Yeah.

13:17.975 --> 13:20.010
We're not sick.
We're on official business.

13:20.077 --> 13:22.045
So you have to respect
the badge.

13:22.113 --> 13:23.980
They get it.
Put the badge away now.

13:24.048 --> 13:26.216
Hey, any sign of him?
Here, take a whiff of this.

13:26.284 --> 13:28.218
- Excuse me.
- It's Adam's shirt.

13:28.286 --> 13:29.453
I'm not a dog.

13:29.521 --> 13:30.954
That's right.
She's not a dog, Hicks.

13:31.022 --> 13:32.990
What do you smell?

13:33.058 --> 13:35.993
Help me.
Somebody help me.

13:36.061 --> 13:38.596
It's a sound, actually.

13:38.663 --> 13:40.464
Okay.

13:40.532 --> 13:42.300
- Gary. Gary.
- Yeah.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.667
Tap into the security cameras
and give me a shout

13:43.735 --> 13:45.036
if you see anything, okay?
Yeah.

13:45.103 --> 13:46.471
Hicks!
What?

13:46.538 --> 13:48.506
I'm not a dog.

13:48.574 --> 13:50.442
I have to find
better reception.

13:52.912 --> 13:55.281
Ooh. Adam is
definitely up here.

13:55.348 --> 13:57.383
Just our luck--it's the closed
wing at the hospital.

13:57.451 --> 14:00.320
Yeah, just like
in a horror movie.

14:00.388 --> 14:01.788
I'd be careful if I was you.

14:01.856 --> 14:04.291
Every single horror movie
I have ever seen--

14:04.359 --> 14:05.893
Yeah, the white chick
is tripping and screaming, yeah.

14:05.961 --> 14:07.094
No, no, try it again.

14:07.162 --> 14:08.295
Yeah, the black guy's
gonna die first?

14:08.363 --> 14:10.230
I don't think so.

14:10.298 --> 14:11.765
I'm trying.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.801
Please help me.
Why can't anyone hear me?

14:13.868 --> 14:15.636
I think it's this way,
you guys.

14:15.704 --> 14:19.172
I-I can't pinpoint exactly
where the sound's coming from.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.774
When I talked
to the hospital staff,

14:20.841 --> 14:24.110
they said that this Adam
freak-out isn't the first time.

14:24.178 --> 14:26.279
Apparently a lot of weird stuff
has been happening lately.

14:26.347 --> 14:28.482
Equipment's been malfunctioning,
people seeing things

14:28.550 --> 14:29.883
out of the corner
of their eye, and--

14:29.951 --> 14:33.487
These are the people in charge
of my health care, huh?

14:33.555 --> 14:35.289
Yeah, well...

14:35.356 --> 14:37.825
As an investigator, I'm not
gonna dismiss the possibility

14:37.892 --> 14:38.992
out of hand.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.361
Please.

14:41.429 --> 14:42.995
Can anyone hear me?

14:43.063 --> 14:45.665
Adam's close.

14:45.732 --> 14:48.134
I can smell his fear.

14:48.202 --> 14:49.335
Okay, you know what?

14:49.403 --> 14:51.737
I'll take this one.
With her.

14:51.805 --> 14:53.706
Help me.

14:53.774 --> 14:55.141
Yeah, go get 'em, cowboy.

15:06.218 --> 15:07.785
- Hi, Gary.
- Oh.

15:12.591 --> 15:14.825
Uh, Anna.
You're dead.

15:18.186 --> 15:19.821
You can't really be here.

15:19.888 --> 15:21.155
You can't be.
You're dead.

15:21.223 --> 15:22.557
So what am I, then?

15:22.625 --> 15:23.758
Anna doesn't talk--

15:23.826 --> 15:25.760
Anna didn't talk
when she was alive.

15:25.828 --> 15:26.994
Well, I'm different now,
I guess.

15:27.062 --> 15:28.563
No, you--

15:28.630 --> 15:30.798
oh, sir. Sir.

15:30.866 --> 15:33.501
I have--I'm a federal agent.
I have a question.

15:33.569 --> 15:34.902
Can you see Anna there?

15:34.970 --> 15:36.270
There's nobody there.

15:36.338 --> 15:38.939
- No, sir, look there.
- Hey! Hands off, man.

15:39.007 --> 15:40.341
There are plenty
of doctors here.

15:40.409 --> 15:41.843
Why don't you go talk to one?

15:41.911 --> 15:43.145
Well

15:43.213 --> 15:44.513
oh, yeah, no,
he could be right.

15:44.581 --> 15:46.115
I could have a brain tumor.

15:46.182 --> 15:47.516
Yeah, that would make sense.

15:47.584 --> 15:50.519
Gary, you see things
all the time other people can't.

15:50.587 --> 15:52.021
Your signals.

15:52.088 --> 15:54.056
Yeah, I see signals,
but I don't hallucinate.

15:54.124 --> 15:56.358
I don't see hallucinations.

16:00.429 --> 16:02.463
Are you haunting me?

16:04.333 --> 16:05.967
I just saw
Senator Burton.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.435
She's telling the truth.

16:07.503 --> 16:08.903
Now she didn't know, but...

16:08.971 --> 16:11.039
It felt like
she thought she did.

16:11.107 --> 16:14.510
Well, if she thought she did,
chances are she does know.

16:14.577 --> 16:16.879
Our memories are often stored
in scattered fragments

16:16.946 --> 16:17.980
throughout our brains--

16:18.048 --> 16:20.049
hidden, trapped
just out of reach.

16:20.116 --> 16:21.784
But if the information
is in there--

16:21.852 --> 16:23.887
which I believe it is--

16:23.955 --> 16:26.392
I'm thinking you might be able
to retrieve it.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.760
Yeah, but I already
tried pushing her.

16:27.828 --> 16:30.764
No, this is more of a pull
than a push, Nina.

16:30.831 --> 16:33.066
We could use some
sensory recognition technique

16:33.134 --> 16:35.769
with your ability...

16:35.837 --> 16:38.339
and you could help her
reconnect the bits of memory.

16:38.406 --> 16:40.908
Lee, I've never tried
anything like that.

16:40.976 --> 16:42.609
No, I-I know.

16:42.677 --> 16:44.578
But you've done a lot
of things of late

16:44.646 --> 16:48.081
that, uh,
were previously unprecedented.

16:48.149 --> 16:49.483
Now, I wouldn't ask you
to do this

16:49.550 --> 16:52.986
unless you were
completely comfortable.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.222
The senator's getting on
the red-eye for London tonight.

16:55.290 --> 16:58.325
We should find her at
the airport before she leaves.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.794
If she's got part
of Parish's agenda in her head,

17:00.862 --> 17:02.128
we should get on it now.

17:02.196 --> 17:04.964
I agree.

17:05.031 --> 17:07.099
But first we have to determine
whether or not

17:07.167 --> 17:09.936
you can actually pull
a repressed memory.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.109
And we have
the perfect test subject.

17:16.176 --> 17:18.713
Hey.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.615
What's up?

17:22.117 --> 17:23.818
Have you ever had anything
like this done before?

17:23.886 --> 17:26.989
Most likely, yeah.
I don't remember.

17:27.056 --> 17:28.423
Well, this is gonna be
a little different.

17:28.491 --> 17:30.659
I want to see if Nina can help
you retrieve some memory

17:30.727 --> 17:33.061
that your brain has,
for whatever reason,

17:33.129 --> 17:34.463
buried away.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.831
She's gonna ask you
some questions.

17:35.898 --> 17:38.633
Just relax and just answer
what comes to mind.

17:38.701 --> 17:39.868
Okay.

17:39.936 --> 17:42.003
I'm down for whatever.

17:48.509 --> 17:51.544
It's okay.
Don't be scared.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.347
I'm not.
It just felt right.

17:58.186 --> 18:02.122
Um, shall we start
with your sixteenth birthday?

18:05.593 --> 18:07.894
Focus on the walls.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.731
Can you make out a color?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.167
Remember,
it's your birthday, Kat.

18:13.234 --> 18:16.971
Can you smell anything...
Good.

18:17.038 --> 18:19.306
Food cooking,
candles burning?

18:19.374 --> 18:21.709
Can you taste anything...

18:21.776 --> 18:23.911
Cake?
Chocolate.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.313
Excellent.

18:26.381 --> 18:30.151
The kind of chocolate frosting
that comes in a can.

18:30.218 --> 18:31.585
Beige walls...

18:31.653 --> 18:33.154
paintings...

18:33.221 --> 18:35.423
landscapes...

18:35.491 --> 18:37.058
Ugh, they suck.

18:38.527 --> 18:40.628
Nina, try to personalize it.

18:40.696 --> 18:43.364
Is anyone there with you?

18:43.432 --> 18:44.799
There's a woman.

18:57.980 --> 19:00.148
- Nina, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19:00.215 --> 19:01.716
I just, um...

19:01.783 --> 19:04.151
I need a break.

19:04.219 --> 19:05.286
All right.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.121
It's fine.
I got what I need.

19:07.222 --> 19:08.689
You can do it, Nina.

19:08.757 --> 19:11.191
If we leave now, we can catch
the senator at the airport.

19:11.259 --> 19:13.293
So I can take
these off now, right?

19:13.361 --> 19:14.261
Yeah, sure.

19:14.328 --> 19:17.163
Thank you for your cooperation.

19:18.999 --> 19:21.000
Just leave the money
on the dresser.

19:25.306 --> 19:26.973
Why didn't you disappear
all the way?

19:27.041 --> 19:29.075
Down the hallway,
you disappeared all the way.

19:29.143 --> 19:32.747
Oh, you're getting stronger
the higher up we go,

19:32.814 --> 19:34.081
like a signal.

19:34.149 --> 19:35.550
But you're not
electromagnetic.

19:35.618 --> 19:37.385
If dead people
were electromagnetic

19:37.453 --> 19:39.587
then I would have seen
them before,

19:39.655 --> 19:42.557
like today at the--
oh! You touched me.

19:42.624 --> 19:44.759
I'm sorry. I know you
don't like to be touched,

19:44.827 --> 19:48.529
but you put that tie
on for me, and...

19:48.597 --> 19:49.630
you look nice.

19:49.698 --> 19:52.267
Yeah.

20:01.278 --> 20:03.179
Oh, it's him.

20:03.247 --> 20:05.048
His heart is racing.

20:08.919 --> 20:10.820
Bill...

20:10.888 --> 20:12.955
He's in here.

20:13.023 --> 20:14.190
Bill?

20:14.257 --> 20:16.592
Bill.

20:16.660 --> 20:18.560
Maggie, I can help.
Aah!

20:20.513 --> 20:21.813
The scream came
from this room.

20:21.881 --> 20:24.083
Rachel? Rachel!

20:24.150 --> 20:25.284
She's not answering.

20:25.351 --> 20:26.385
You were supposed
to stay with her!

20:26.452 --> 20:27.886
Don't try
to gaslight me, Hicks.

20:27.954 --> 20:29.588
You were with her.
No, I wasn't.

20:29.655 --> 20:30.990
Rachel!

20:31.057 --> 20:32.491
Okay, I'm gonna get security
and get them to do

20:32.559 --> 20:35.561
a floor-by-floor sweep.
Get Rosen on this thing.

20:35.628 --> 20:37.062
This isn't just about looking
for an Alpha.

20:37.130 --> 20:40.299
This place is getting
really weird.

20:40.366 --> 20:43.569
Bill, I understand.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

20:43.636 --> 20:46.739
For both of us.

20:46.806 --> 20:49.107
She's there.

20:49.175 --> 20:50.776
Nina, what did you do
to your hand?

20:50.843 --> 20:52.845
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

20:52.912 --> 20:55.447
When you were
holding hands with Kat,

20:55.515 --> 20:57.116
is that what--

20:57.183 --> 20:59.518
Kat spent a lot of time
in hospitals,

20:59.586 --> 21:03.889
people poking around her head.

21:03.957 --> 21:07.793
Somebody held her hand, and...

21:07.861 --> 21:10.729
It must have been nice.

21:12.899 --> 21:14.499
Nina, if I'm asking
too much of you right now,

21:14.567 --> 21:17.134
you have to tell me, please.

21:17.202 --> 21:19.470
This isn't worth
putting you at risk.

21:19.538 --> 21:22.373
Perfect world, you wouldn't need
to use your ability at all.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.775
But the world
isn't perfect...

21:24.843 --> 21:26.977
and I want to help.

21:32.516 --> 21:34.251
I like sleeping
at the office,

21:34.318 --> 21:37.020
'cause I never have
to get a ride to work,

21:37.088 --> 21:40.189
and I never have
to get a ride home.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.425
I'm already home.

21:42.493 --> 21:44.694
Oh, you can laugh.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.829
I didn't know
that you could do that.

21:47.998 --> 21:49.431
Oh, wait, wait.

21:49.499 --> 21:51.900
Yeah. This better be important.
I'm talking to Anna.

21:51.968 --> 21:53.202
Gary, what?

21:53.269 --> 21:56.639
Focus.
Ping Rachel's phone.

21:56.706 --> 21:57.806
I can't find her.

21:57.874 --> 21:59.375
Yeah, okay, Bill,
I'll get to it.

21:59.442 --> 22:02.278
But I'm in the middle
of something that I'm doing.

22:02.345 --> 22:04.748
- Did you just hang up on me?
- Bill! Help me!

22:04.815 --> 22:05.915
Rachel!

22:05.983 --> 22:08.051
Gary, you should help
your friends.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.120
The neuro-diverse need
to be there for each other.

22:14.591 --> 22:17.026
Someone approached you
from the foundation.

22:17.094 --> 22:19.796
Was it a man?

22:19.864 --> 22:22.398
His scent--
was he perspiring?

22:22.466 --> 22:25.435
Was he...wearing cologne?

22:25.502 --> 22:27.336
A light scent...

22:27.404 --> 22:28.904
lemony.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.840
I couldn't place the brand.

22:30.907 --> 22:34.344
It was a Tuesday.
He was wearing a gray suit.

22:35.512 --> 22:36.946
Senator?
Our flight is boarding.

22:37.014 --> 22:38.615
Don't lose her focus, Nina.

22:38.682 --> 22:40.584
What did he ask you to do?

22:40.651 --> 22:42.719
Trial tests...

22:42.787 --> 22:44.554
Medical.
Medical what?

22:44.622 --> 22:46.089
Senator, it's almost time.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.390
Now think of the man.

22:47.458 --> 22:50.259
His gray suit, his scent...

22:50.327 --> 22:53.597
Medical what?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.198
- August.
- August.

22:55.266 --> 22:56.700
Good.

22:56.768 --> 22:58.803
This August or last year?

23:02.541 --> 23:03.875
Senator?

23:03.943 --> 23:05.677
They're boarding now.

23:05.745 --> 23:08.347
We're old friends,
just catching up.

23:16.422 --> 23:19.524
Does August mean
anything to you?

23:19.591 --> 23:22.127
We'll figure it out.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.828
We should go.

23:30.135 --> 23:32.570
Rachel.

23:32.638 --> 23:34.339
Rachel.

23:39.813 --> 23:41.847
Rachel.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.188
Rachel?

23:59.633 --> 24:01.534
Rachel.

24:17.317 --> 24:19.885
Rachel?

24:26.792 --> 24:28.293
Dad!
Dad, help me!

24:28.360 --> 24:29.827
Hello?

24:33.665 --> 24:37.101
Dad, help me!

24:37.169 --> 24:39.270
Dad!
Hey!

24:39.337 --> 24:40.604
- Dad!
- Hey!

24:40.672 --> 24:42.539
- Help me!
- Hey!

24:42.607 --> 24:45.609
My kid's not dead!
Hey, stop!

24:45.677 --> 24:48.479
It's okay, Maggie,
you're gonna be okay.

24:48.546 --> 24:51.348
I'm gonna get
you out of here.

24:51.416 --> 24:52.582
No, no, shh!

24:52.650 --> 24:54.518
If they hear you, Maggie,

24:54.585 --> 24:57.754
they'll put you back
in the drawer, okay?

24:57.822 --> 24:59.556
This machine drains the blood.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.990
I got to get the drugs
out of you, okay?

25:01.058 --> 25:02.225
Make you clean.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.927
Okay, Maggie?

25:25.049 --> 25:26.784
Maggie!

25:28.353 --> 25:30.054
Wait, where are you going?

25:30.122 --> 25:33.191
Why are you running from me?

25:36.696 --> 25:39.565
Rachel!

25:39.632 --> 25:41.800
Come on, come on.

25:41.868 --> 25:42.902
Unh!

25:42.969 --> 25:44.170
Rachel!

25:46.339 --> 25:49.508
Help! Help!
Help, I'm drowning!

25:55.982 --> 25:57.549
Help!

25:57.617 --> 25:59.284
I'm drowning.

25:59.352 --> 26:00.852
I'm drowning.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.421
I'm drowning.

26:02.488 --> 26:04.622
Help me.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.792
I'm drowning.

26:06.859 --> 26:08.093
I'm drowning.

26:09.896 --> 26:12.764
Rachel?

26:26.345 --> 26:29.913
Adam.
Adam, help me.

26:29.981 --> 26:32.115
I'm drowning.

26:32.183 --> 26:34.451
Maggie?

26:47.800 --> 26:49.568
Aah!

26:56.218 --> 26:58.353
Rachel.

27:10.366 --> 27:12.400
Gary, you scared
the hell out of me.

27:12.467 --> 27:15.069
Bill, get a hold of yourself.
I pinged Rachel's phone for you.

27:15.137 --> 27:16.804
I wanted to help Anna, but
she said that I should come--

27:16.872 --> 27:18.372
Gary, what are you
talking about? Anna is dead.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.874
No, no,
she's not dead, Bill.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.309
She's here.

27:21.377 --> 27:23.211
Wait.
Are you seeing things too?

27:23.279 --> 27:25.346
No, I'm not seeing things.
I'm seeing Anna. She's a person.

27:25.414 --> 27:28.349
Anyway, Rachel's upstairs.
You should go and help her.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.250
- No, come on, let's go.
- Yeah--no, Bill!

27:30.318 --> 27:31.785
We got to get the hell
out of here and find Rachel.

27:31.853 --> 27:32.786
You go find her.

27:32.854 --> 27:34.721
I've got to help Anna.

27:34.789 --> 27:38.725
Dad! Help me!

27:38.793 --> 27:40.961
Dad!

27:41.028 --> 27:45.031
Tyler! No!

27:46.967 --> 27:48.368
What's happening?
Dad!

27:48.435 --> 27:51.004
- Please, stop!
- Dad, help me!

27:57.278 --> 27:58.245
Dad!

28:00.448 --> 28:02.483
Dad!
Tyler!

28:02.551 --> 28:03.884
No, please, stop!

28:03.952 --> 28:05.653
- Dad!
- Please let him go!

28:05.720 --> 28:07.054
I'll do whatever you want!

28:07.122 --> 28:08.188
Take me instead!

28:08.256 --> 28:10.090
Tyler!

28:10.158 --> 28:13.093
Rachel?

28:13.160 --> 28:14.527
Rachel?

28:14.595 --> 28:16.963
Ra--

28:17.030 --> 28:20.099
Rachel!

28:21.468 --> 28:23.469
Rachel!

28:24.838 --> 28:25.804
Rachel!

28:40.553 --> 28:41.954
Wha...

28:42.021 --> 28:44.990
That shouldn't be happening--
just like you, Anna.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.064
This is a special phone
Skylar gave to me.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.967
You'd like her.
She has tattoos.

28:55.035 --> 28:56.435
Oh, yeah, look.

28:56.503 --> 28:58.037
That's what's
vibrating the cart.

28:58.105 --> 28:59.539
I found your signal, Anna.

28:59.606 --> 29:01.708
It's infrasound.
I've read about that.

29:01.775 --> 29:03.809
- What's causing it?
- I don't know.

29:03.877 --> 29:05.478
It could be machinery,

29:05.545 --> 29:07.613
like an industrial
air conditioner.

29:07.681 --> 29:10.549
- So I might just be the A.C.?
- I'm not sure yet.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.387
It's about time
you got here.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.721
Rachel wrote that.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.089
And Adam is dead.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.991
Something made Adam
drown himself

29:20.058 --> 29:22.026
and whatever that something is,
is affecting Rachel, okay?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.794
And I think
it's affecting Hicks as well.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.029
Now, we have to find out
what it is

29:25.097 --> 29:27.364
because we are dealing
with something

29:27.432 --> 29:28.499
that we don't understand.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.234
No! You don't
understand it, Bill.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.636
I do. It's infrasound.
What is infrasound?

29:32.704 --> 29:34.705
It's a sonic frequency
below the threshold

29:34.773 --> 29:36.007
of normal human hearing.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.208
Yeah, and it makes
things vibrate,

29:37.276 --> 29:38.609
like those tools
and the lights.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.411
It can have a dramatic effect
on people's brains.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.046
Yeah, people
who aren't even Alphas.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.681
But it affects alphas more.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.449
Okay, so that's got
to be affecting Rachel, right?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.051
I mean--
Yeah, yeah!

29:47.118 --> 29:49.053
It's making you crazy, though,
but it's letting me see Anna.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.055
- What? You've seen Anna?
- Yeah, look.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.559
I recorded it on my phone.
You can't hear it.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.995
But you can see it, yeah.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.329
Gary, can you modify
this signal somehow

29:58.397 --> 29:59.664
to make it audible?

29:59.732 --> 30:02.233
Yeah, of course I can.
I'm a professional.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.602
Help me.
I'm drowning.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.504
That's not
an air conditioner.

30:06.572 --> 30:07.672
Drowning?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.574
- The elevator, right?
- Yes.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.443
Rachel thinks she's drowning.
I-I've got to find her.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.578
I've got to help her.
Bill, be careful-

30:13.645 --> 30:15.013
you're probably
being affected too.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.581
So the closer you get
to the source of the sound,

30:16.649 --> 30:18.449
the more powerful
it will be.

30:18.517 --> 30:22.420
Help me.
Help me, I'm drowning.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.688
Help. Help.

30:24.756 --> 30:25.889
I'm drowning.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.327
Oh, my God!

30:31.395 --> 30:33.229
Nina!

30:35.833 --> 30:38.268
We're very close to it,
'cause Anna's hardly disappeared

30:38.336 --> 30:39.469
off of here at all.

30:39.537 --> 30:41.404
I'm taking her
to the source.

30:41.472 --> 30:43.573
All right, Gary.
You're helping Anna, right?

30:43.641 --> 30:44.941
Yeah.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.176
Bill is desperate
to help Rachel.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.212
It appears
that you're all acting

30:48.279 --> 30:51.314
on that subliminal cry for help
embedded in the infrasound.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.750
But Bill thinks
that it's a spirit.

30:53.818 --> 30:55.352
He believes in spirits.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.854
He might not be
so far off, Gary.

30:57.922 --> 31:01.125
Machines don't cry for help.
People do.

31:46.352 --> 31:48.920
There were three near-drowning
patients last year...

31:48.988 --> 31:51.256
Stacy Fung,
discharged after two days.

31:52.592 --> 31:54.960
Andrew Mittman, D.O.A.
That's dead on arrival.

31:56.395 --> 31:58.196
And there's Jason Miller.
He--oh, Dr. Rosen!

31:58.264 --> 32:00.866
He's still here.
1626.

32:00.933 --> 32:03.001
- 1626.
- Yeah.

32:03.069 --> 32:04.903
- Oh, that's on another floor.
- Persistent vegetative state.

32:04.971 --> 32:06.171
It says that
he's brain-dead.

32:06.239 --> 32:08.774
Well, that might
not be accurate.

32:08.842 --> 32:11.476
The machines might not
be registering brain activity.

32:11.544 --> 32:13.412
But if he is communicating
somehow--

32:13.479 --> 32:15.180
Oh, no, Dr. Rosen,
it says that his parents

32:15.248 --> 32:18.350
are gonna let them harvest
his organs for transplant.

32:18.417 --> 32:19.918
He's 16.

32:19.985 --> 32:22.720
Well, if the doctors believe
that he was indeed brain-dead,

32:22.788 --> 32:24.355
they would never
have tried to revive him.

32:24.423 --> 32:25.656
Gary, stay right here
for a moment.

32:25.724 --> 32:26.991
But, Dr. Rosen,
where are you going?

32:27.059 --> 32:28.593
I think there may be a way
to save this boy

32:28.660 --> 32:29.827
and stop the infrasound.

32:29.895 --> 32:30.928
I'll be right back.

32:35.067 --> 32:36.334
What's wrong, Gary?

32:36.401 --> 32:38.736
Adam's an Alpha,
and the infrasound--

32:38.804 --> 32:39.938
it affected his brain.

32:40.005 --> 32:41.473
He saw his dead sister.

32:41.540 --> 32:43.942
And I'm an Alpha,
and I can see you.

32:44.010 --> 32:45.744
You're not real.

32:45.811 --> 32:47.979
But I like seeing you.

32:50.416 --> 32:53.918
We're gonna find Jason
before Dr. Rosen does.

32:58.590 --> 33:02.927
This way.
That way.

33:02.995 --> 33:05.329
Yeah, this is it.

33:05.397 --> 33:07.098
That's him, Anna.

33:07.166 --> 33:09.000
He's emitting the infrasound.

33:09.068 --> 33:11.603
And look--look, the machines
say that he's dead.

33:11.671 --> 33:14.172
Machines
don't understand us.

33:19.245 --> 33:20.945
- Gary, open the door, please.
- No!

33:21.013 --> 33:22.814
Gary, open the door!

33:22.882 --> 33:24.983
Gary, we can't locate Harken,
Hicks, and Rachel.

33:25.051 --> 33:26.685
But if I'm right,
they're in serious trouble.

33:26.753 --> 33:27.920
I have to wake Jason up!

33:27.987 --> 33:30.322
It's the only way
to stop the infrasound.

33:30.390 --> 33:31.757
No, Dr. Rosen!

33:31.824 --> 33:33.959
If you wake him up,
then I'm gonna lose Anna, again!

33:34.027 --> 33:35.260
You know that, Dr. Rosen!

33:38.465 --> 33:39.665
Gary, listen to me.

33:39.733 --> 33:41.266
You're not thinking clearly
right now.

33:41.334 --> 33:42.901
Yeah, I know! But I don't want
to think clearly.

33:42.969 --> 33:45.871
Dr. Rosen, I couldn't save Anna
at Highland Mills,

33:45.939 --> 33:47.139
but I can this time.

33:50.177 --> 33:52.711
The Anna you see right now--
she's an hallucination.

33:52.779 --> 33:55.281
And what she is saying to you
is what you want her to say.

33:55.348 --> 33:56.582
No! No!
That's not true!

33:56.649 --> 33:58.050
Gary, she is not real.

33:58.117 --> 33:59.952
Yes! She's real,
'cause she touched me.

34:00.019 --> 34:02.688
And she says things
that only Anna would say.

34:02.755 --> 34:06.058
All right, then ask her.
Ask Anna what you should do.

34:06.126 --> 34:07.827
No, I don't want to ask her.

34:07.895 --> 34:09.996
Maybe Anna needs
to tell you something.

34:12.500 --> 34:16.202
Gary, please.
Please.

34:16.270 --> 34:18.304
Gary, Jason's one of us.

34:18.373 --> 34:21.507
You couldn't help me,
but you can save his life.

34:21.574 --> 34:23.944
He's crying out for help.

34:24.012 --> 34:26.746
Gary, the neuro-diverse
need to be there for each other.

34:39.429 --> 34:41.563
Sorry, Dr. Rosen.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.567
Thank you, Gary.

34:44.635 --> 34:47.370
We have to stick together.

35:12.061 --> 35:14.429
You did
the right thing, Gary.

35:34.317 --> 35:36.752
Come on, Rachel.
Come on.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.087
Come on.

35:39.155 --> 35:40.522
Come on.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.436
Bill.

35:59.508 --> 36:00.875
Jason,
do you remember anything

36:00.943 --> 36:02.610
about what's happened to you,

36:02.678 --> 36:05.613
like, uh, sensations
of drowning,

36:05.681 --> 36:08.683
feeling trapped in your mind,

36:08.750 --> 36:11.619
trying to cry out for help?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.024
Nothing?

36:19.429 --> 36:22.965
All right, um,
can I do anything for you?

36:26.102 --> 36:29.071
Uh, can I, um...

36:29.139 --> 36:32.409
Can I have some chips?

36:32.476 --> 36:33.643
Sure.
What kind?

36:33.711 --> 36:36.146
- The salt-and-vinegar kind.
- Sure.

36:36.214 --> 36:37.647
I think we can make
that happen.

36:37.715 --> 36:38.815
Thanks.

36:46.091 --> 36:47.792
Is that a photic stimulator?

36:47.859 --> 36:49.627
Yes.

36:49.694 --> 36:51.762
How long has it been in use
in this hospital?

36:51.830 --> 36:53.497
About six months.

36:53.565 --> 36:55.666
Was that device
ever used on this man?

36:55.734 --> 36:57.134
We use it
on all comatose patients

36:57.202 --> 37:00.070
to test brain activity.

37:06.244 --> 37:08.311
"August Medical."

37:08.379 --> 37:09.479
August.

37:18.818 --> 37:20.986
Cameron?

37:21.053 --> 37:23.889
You can't just show up here
without my permission.

37:23.956 --> 37:25.890
I'm sorry.
I got to see him.

37:25.958 --> 37:28.860
Please.

37:28.927 --> 37:31.729
Okay.

37:31.797 --> 37:33.631
Dad?

37:36.501 --> 37:40.171
What are you doing here?

37:40.239 --> 37:42.306
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:47.346 --> 37:49.213
What are you doing, huh?

37:58.489 --> 38:00.657
- Rachel, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

38:11.768 --> 38:14.169
Thanks for asking.

38:20.677 --> 38:22.978
When sketching
the female form,

38:23.046 --> 38:24.780
start with a long
vertical line

38:24.848 --> 38:27.482
divided in two
unequal parts.

38:27.550 --> 38:29.317
The long part
will be the body

38:29.385 --> 38:31.586
and the short part
will be the head.

38:31.654 --> 38:34.722
Sketch the body
creating a skeleton

38:34.790 --> 38:37.859
using horizontal lines
for hips and shoulders

38:37.926 --> 38:40.527
and vertical lines
for arms and legs.

38:40.595 --> 38:43.063
As you get the hang
of the proportions,

38:43.131 --> 38:46.332
gradually employ curvature.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.267
The female form can be
divided into

38:48.335 --> 38:51.103
approximately eight circles
up and down

38:51.171 --> 38:54.873
with cylindrical shapes
for the arms and joints.

38:54.941 --> 38:58.010
As women have more rounded
bodies than men,

38:58.078 --> 38:59.645
their hips should
always be drawn

38:59.713 --> 39:03.015
the same width
as the shoulders.

39:03.083 --> 39:05.384
Light and shadow are key
to rendering

39:05.452 --> 39:06.652
lifelike images.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.020
People know
how shadows play

39:08.088 --> 39:09.455
across the curves
and crevices

39:09.522 --> 39:11.290
of the female body.

39:11.357 --> 39:14.159
By properly shading
the creases of the skin,

39:14.227 --> 39:15.661
you'll create the illusion

39:15.728 --> 39:18.697
that the figure is lifelike
and three dimensional.

39:47.028 --> 39:48.396
Dr. Rosen...

39:48.463 --> 39:50.431
I tracked down where
every photic stimulator

39:50.499 --> 39:52.600
from August Medical went.
Oh, great.

39:52.668 --> 39:54.336
2,700 different
hospitals...

39:54.403 --> 39:56.772
- 2,700?
- Across the country, yeah.

39:56.839 --> 39:58.807
And there's 42
different models of this.

39:58.874 --> 40:02.444
That's a lot.

40:02.511 --> 40:05.014
And we have no idea
what this thing does

40:05.081 --> 40:06.915
to people's brains

40:06.983 --> 40:09.619
or how it fits
into Stanton Parish's agenda,

40:09.686 --> 40:10.953
if indeed it does.

40:11.021 --> 40:12.688
Gary, do you remember
the young woman

40:12.756 --> 40:14.891
who built you your phone?
Yes, Skylar.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.426
But she wasn't young.

40:16.493 --> 40:18.127
- Do you still have it with you?
- Yeah, of course I have it.

40:18.195 --> 40:19.362
It was a present.

40:19.430 --> 40:20.630
You're supposed
to keep presents,

40:20.697 --> 40:22.198
even if you don't like them.

40:22.266 --> 40:24.367
And, yeah, she said
I could call her on this.

40:24.435 --> 40:25.768
Well, I'm thinking
she might be the one

40:25.836 --> 40:27.937
to figure out
how this thing works.

40:28.005 --> 40:31.241
- Oh, does she speak Chinese?
- I don't know. Why?

40:31.308 --> 40:32.976
Oh, these were manufactured
in China,

40:33.044 --> 40:34.978
and I don't speak Chinese.

40:35.046 --> 40:38.215
Anna speaks Chinese.
<i>Speaks</i> Chinese, Gary?

40:38.283 --> 40:41.152
You--you just referred to Anna
in the present tense.

40:41.219 --> 40:43.921
It's okay if you think of Anna
as still being with you,

40:43.989 --> 40:46.992
but you should realize that--
Oh, no, I don't think that.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.428
She was with me,
and now she's not with me.

40:49.496 --> 40:52.130
But I found another way
to honor Anna, Dr. Rosen.

40:52.198 --> 40:53.866
All right.

40:53.933 --> 40:57.202
Dr. Rosen, it's late.
You--you should go home,

40:57.270 --> 40:59.538
'cause you don't live here,
but I do--I live here.

40:59.605 --> 41:02.641
Yes, that's right.
Thanks, Gary.
