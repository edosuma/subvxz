WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.435
Your wound is festering with dark magic.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.186
I-- I don't know if that's necessary.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.065
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
You're lucky to be alive.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.234
I've always wanted to use these.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.361
-Here, bite down on this.
-[grunting]

00:28.737 --> 00:31.156
Hey, that's my boyfriend
you're operating on!

00:31.239 --> 00:33.658
Oh! Humans! Sound the alarm!

00:33.742 --> 00:36.995
Hold! Please, Vendel of Dwoza.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.164
I humble myself before you.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.791
Camelot needs your help.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.586
[Douxie whistling]

00:44.669 --> 00:46.379
[theme music playing]

01:14.365 --> 01:17.786
[Arthur] Gunmar the Black's swarm
of Gumm-Gumms are ready to strike.

01:17.869 --> 01:21.122
The monsters seek vengeance
on both our kind.

01:21.206 --> 01:25.585
And after all you've done, you expect
us Trolls to fight this war for you?

01:25.668 --> 01:30.131
No, not for me; with me, as equals.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.674
Glorkus me!

01:31.758 --> 01:36.304
I vow, if we win this war,
we shall live in peace.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.014
-Ha!
-[helmet clangs]

01:38.097 --> 01:40.058
-[soldiers murmuring]
-[soldier] Hey! [growls]

01:40.225 --> 01:42.811
-[chuckles]
-Move your rocky butt, Calamity!

01:42.894 --> 01:45.230
[gasps] Hu-hu-humans!

01:45.313 --> 01:47.232
It's an infestation!

01:47.315 --> 01:50.360
No, I believe it's a negotiation. [gasps]

01:50.443 --> 01:53.238
By Gorgus, the king seeks an alliance!

01:53.321 --> 01:54.447
Are they mad?

01:54.614 --> 01:59.536
Gumm-Gumms are terrifying warriors
while we are but humble gravel miners.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.288
How do you expect us
to ever defeat Gunmar?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.624
We will give you a secret weapon.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.750
A weapon?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.503
[soldier grunts]

02:08.586 --> 02:10.421
You really think they can work this out?

02:10.505 --> 02:13.383
They have to, or everyone in Camelot
and Dwoza are doomed.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.677
Then so is saving history. Great.

02:15.760 --> 02:20.974
I assure you, all will be fine
once I've completed my amulet.

02:21.057 --> 02:25.145
So, this is the once and future
Trollhunter I've heard of.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.814
May I have a word, alone?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.525
Um, sure. Be right back.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.069
I can't believe it.

02:33.153 --> 02:38.408
Arthur wants us Trolls fighting alongside
his big, shiny knights like heroes?

02:38.491 --> 02:43.246
Us? No one's asking you to fight, No-Name.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.206
I knew you were cursed, Callista.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.043
You've brought outsiders
and their war into our home!

02:50.128 --> 02:54.591
[guard 1] Hey, look who it is--
Blinkous the Gumm-Gumm Tamer.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.342
[guard 2] Hey, your prisoner awaits.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.721
Just don't get too close to him.
You know what happened to the other Troll.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.180
[stammers] What happened?

03:01.264 --> 03:03.892
[guard 1] Well, beastie here
pulled his eyes out.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.768
His eyes?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.604
-All of them?
-[guard 2] Yep.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.023
At least he couldn't see
his limbs getting torn off.

03:10.106 --> 03:14.694
-[gasps] Great Gronka Morka!
-[guard 1] Have fun in there, Galadrigal.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.615
-[gate slams]
-[screams]

03:18.698 --> 03:20.241
-[guards cackle]
-[clears throat]

03:20.325 --> 03:22.285
Greetings, Savage One.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.787
I bring undergarments as a snack.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.498
-Have you eaten?
-[growls]

03:27.624 --> 03:29.876
[screams] Not my eyes!

03:30.919 --> 03:32.545
Are-- Are you all right?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.882
Why aren't you indiscriminately
smashing my spine?

03:35.965 --> 03:41.971
When Gunmar find out Aaarrrgghh fail,
Gunmar kill Aaarrrgghh.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.515
Well, that seems a tad harsh.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.143
One may say an overreaction.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.854
Perhaps eating this woolly muck
will lift your spirits.

03:50.021 --> 03:50.855
[snorts]

03:50.939 --> 03:54.484
-[roaring]
-[screams]

03:54.609 --> 03:56.694
Ugh. Plech! Oh.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.448
Go. Leave Aaarrrgghh to die.

04:00.531 --> 04:04.619
Oh, my, it seems we are both lost causes.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.038
I'm no tamer of Gumm-Gumms.

04:07.121 --> 04:11.417
I'm a weakling, a coward, a pacifist.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.170
[Aaarrrgghh] "Pa-cee-fist"...

04:14.254 --> 04:15.922
Don't know word.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.425
Mm. Tasty socks.

04:20.301 --> 04:24.055
I regret that it is beyond my power.

04:24.264 --> 04:29.769
When you return to the present,
the shard will finish its work.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.105
So, that's it, then.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.399
[sighs] Thanks for trying, Merl.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.943
[Claire] Hey, is everything okay?

04:37.026 --> 04:40.405
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, um... nothing.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.699
Just Merlin prepping me
for the trip home.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.368
Wait, wait, wait, you finally finished
the Heart of Avalon?

04:45.451 --> 04:47.078
-It's working?
-Indeed.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.415
But first, we must survive
the battle to come.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.499
[Arthur] Wizard...

04:51.666 --> 04:53.626
we've reached an agreement.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.462
Now you must convince the crowd.

04:57.046 --> 05:01.259
-[indistinct chatter]
-Trolls of Dwoza, hear us now!

05:01.634 --> 05:05.179
As we speak, death comes for us all.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.807
But we bring an offer of hope.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.184
Here comes the light show!

05:11.060 --> 05:14.522
-[trolls gasping]
-I've designed a grand weapon,

05:14.605 --> 05:18.735
an amulet which will choose
the greatest warrior among you

05:18.818 --> 05:24.198
to banish the Gumm-Gumm menace
from our realm and become the Trollhunter!

05:24.574 --> 05:26.117
Trollhunter?

05:26.451 --> 05:29.829
[Arthur] The amulet's power
will activate Killahead Bridge,

05:29.912 --> 05:32.248
once a border between our worlds,

05:32.332 --> 05:36.711
turning it into a magic prison
for Gunmar and his brood,

05:36.794 --> 05:40.381
trapping them in the Darklands
and ending this war!

05:40.548 --> 05:43.426
Wow. We would finally have peace?

05:43.509 --> 05:45.803
No more bloodshed, no more dungeons...

05:45.887 --> 05:47.972
The Trollhunter could save our kind.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.099
Stop gawking, outsider.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.771
I, Draal, Dwoza's strongest,
shall be chosen for glory!

05:54.937 --> 05:57.023
The battle will not be easy.

05:57.106 --> 06:00.068
While the wizard builds this am-yoo-let,

06:00.151 --> 06:03.071
the king's men will train our bravest.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.531
-Indeed. I shall guide the--
-Yeah!

06:05.615 --> 06:10.536
Knights Steve and Lance here
to whip you big hosses into warriors!

06:10.620 --> 06:12.288
Krav Maga! Turtle stance!

06:12.371 --> 06:14.248
Whoo! Ah! Hee-yaw!

06:14.332 --> 06:17.502
Then we ride for Killahead
to draw Gunmar out.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.755
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

06:21.047 --> 06:21.881
Hmm.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.843
Well, it seems we may have a shot
at surviving this after all.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.596
One shot is the best I can offer.

06:28.679 --> 06:33.726
When Killahead activates, it shall unleash
a surge of magic across the realm.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.396
Just enough to power the Heart of Avalon
for a trip through time.

06:37.480 --> 06:42.401
But only one, which means everything
must go according to my plan.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
Hisirdoux, with me.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.280
I need your assistance.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.824
At least we're reunited.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.701
We'll get through this... together.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.913
Come on, I wanna take you somewhere.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.039
Uh, you two take a beat.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.791
Merlin and I have
still got to actually finish

06:56.874 --> 06:59.001
the amulet all our hopes are riding on.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.137
Arthur has sorcerers of his own.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.807
They won't be tricked
by your impure changelings again.

07:14.892 --> 07:19.021
With your Decimaar Blade,
all will submit to your will.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.526
Do it.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.330
[roaring]

07:36.998 --> 07:39.167
Bring the witch to me.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.252
[grunts]

07:50.261 --> 07:52.722
Go, build your army.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.850
Tonight, the Wild Wood will run red.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.895
Our enemies will tremble.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.772
[whistle trilling]

08:02.482 --> 08:05.401
All right, men-- Uh, Trolls! Trolls!

08:05.485 --> 08:08.321
Warfare is both art and skill.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.864
Listen up, rock-jocks!

08:09.947 --> 08:13.534
Class is in session for Steve's
Knight School of Hard Knocks and Rocks!

08:13.618 --> 08:14.619
When I'm done with you,

08:14.702 --> 08:19.040
the amulet will have lean, mean,
kick-butt fighters to choose from.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.919
-Hey! If you pull it out, you eat it!
-[yelps, whimpers]

08:23.419 --> 08:25.046
-Right now.

I guarantee nobody will be kicking sand
in your face anymore!

Become a champion of freedom and love,

08:49.529 --> 08:52.949
worthy to be sculpted on Greek marble!

09:10.925 --> 09:12.802
[Jim] Claire? The battle's coming.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.012
Sure we have time for random surprises?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.013
Okay...

09:16.180 --> 09:17.598
now you can look.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.434
Wow, what a nice field?

09:21.018 --> 09:22.812
Wait, is this-- [gasps]

09:22.895 --> 09:24.730
-Is that--
-It's your house in Arcadia!

09:24.981 --> 09:27.149
Or it will be in, like, a thousand years.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.527
Thought you could use
a reminder of home...

09:29.777 --> 09:31.571
of better times...

09:31.904 --> 09:33.322
and us.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.409
Claire, that's... incredible!

09:36.492 --> 09:40.371
You teleported us across the planet
just for a date! [chuckles]

09:44.584 --> 09:46.252
I hope you're hungry for meat pies

09:46.335 --> 09:50.673
because it was either that
or Callista's sock casserole.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.593
[muffled] Claire, this is perfect.

09:54.051 --> 09:54.927
[Claire exhales]

09:55.177 --> 09:58.222
-[gulps]
-So, earlier...

09:59.015 --> 10:00.725
I figured out what Merlin
was talking about.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.727
-You did? Claire, I--
-Yeah.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.521
You were wondering
if Merlin's new amulet would choose you.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.566
[chuckles] I think one's enough, hero.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.653
-[nervous chuckle] Yeah.
-Hey, wanna see a new trick I learned?

10:15.323 --> 10:18.492
Uh, since when did you become
such an awesome wizard?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.661
Douxie's a pretty solid teacher.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.373
I wanted to be ready
for whatever comes next.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.876
I'm not losing you again.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.087
We should probably head back,

10:30.171 --> 10:31.547
get ready for Killahead.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.215
Can't we stay longer?

10:33.299 --> 10:34.675
Like forever?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.886
Maybe just a few more minutes.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.233
[steam hissing]

10:52.234 --> 10:57.782
The gems have the exact resonance
and light transmissions we require.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.702
Which one speaks to you?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.291
This one.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.529
Quick! Harvest the wave!

11:37.154 --> 11:38.114

12:30.332 --> 12:33.002

12:33.085 --> 12:34.837
Now she helps power it.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.006

lend a hand, eh?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.593

-[chuckles]

12:40.926 --> 12:43.220
There is but one final step.

12:43.304 --> 12:48.601
To lock the amulet together,
two master wizards are required.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.103
By Ambrosius' Gleaming...

12:51.353 --> 12:52.229
Is that...

12:52.605 --> 12:55.608
-Is that for me?
-Thought you'd make something of it.

12:55.691 --> 12:59.445
You've done great things with less,
like that bracelet of yours.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.282
No, I, uh... I can't accept this.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.325
I'm not worthy.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.496
That humility is exactly
why it belongs to you.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.090
[bracelet clicking]

13:21.759 --> 13:25.221
Let us finish this, Master Wizard.

[Merlin] <i>Ad Lucem Gloria Mea.</i>

13:50.454 --> 13:51.539
Now come along.

13:51.622 --> 13:56.210
It is time for the amulet
to choose our champion.

13:58.963 --> 14:04.176
Today, the amulet will choose one of you
to defend your people,

14:04.510 --> 14:08.681
to hunt these Trolls
who have betrayed your kind.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.350
You will no longer fear the daylight.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.646
You will wield it as the Trollhunter.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.816
Let's see which of you brown-snouters
gets picked.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.777
-It would be my honor.
-I am ready.

14:21.860 --> 14:25.322
For the Glory of Merlin... awake.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.712
Whoa, whoa!

14:41.380 --> 14:43.716
[Merlin's voice] <i>Rise, Trollhunter...</i>

14:44.174 --> 14:45.259
<i>and become.</i>

14:45.342 --> 14:48.178
Uh, I think your amulet
has the wrong Troll.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.724
No, the amulet does not make mistakes.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.476
For whatever reason, it has chosen you.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.314
Speak the incantation.

14:58.397 --> 15:02.318
Find your purpose,
the savior of our worlds.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.112
Me? [scoffs] I've never been chosen
for anything.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.325
-"For the Glory of--"
-[Draal] Bushigal!

15:09.408 --> 15:12.494
It chose Callista the Calamity? [growls]

15:12.578 --> 15:15.039
She's basically a fleshbag.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.124
This is the humans' big plan?

15:17.207 --> 15:20.461
The only place
that outsider will lead us is death!

15:20.544 --> 15:23.213
-[trolls murmuring]
-[Merlin] Ignore them. Accept this honor.

15:23.672 --> 15:27.051
No, they're right, I'm not a hero.
I'm not even good at being a Troll.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.678
-Go on, say the words!
-Cal, wait!

15:29.762 --> 15:31.347
[Callista] I... I can't do this!

15:32.014 --> 15:34.099
Is this some sick human joke?

15:34.183 --> 15:37.186
I believe you fleshbags
have done enough damage.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.312
We're doomed!

15:38.395 --> 15:40.189
Gumm-Gumms are coming for us

15:40.272 --> 15:42.524
and we've wasted time
with your silly games!

15:42.608 --> 15:43.692
We must hide!

15:43.776 --> 15:47.196
We all must fight as allies.

15:47.279 --> 15:52.326
You think just because your king gives us
a shiny toy, you can buy our loyalty?

15:52.409 --> 15:55.621
Leave, and take your trinkets with you!

15:55.913 --> 15:58.374
These creatures will never trust me.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.959
Why should they?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.669
This was a mistake.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.879
The amulet chose Callista?

16:03.963 --> 16:07.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wasn't Deya the first Trollhunter?

16:07.174 --> 16:09.885
Either way, without one,
Killahead will be a bloodbath.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.762
I think I know where Callista went.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.888
Claire?

16:14.473 --> 16:15.432
What about the king?

16:15.599 --> 16:18.102
Doesn't history need him
at Killahead as well?

16:18.310 --> 16:19.937
Don't worry, I'm on it.

16:22.022 --> 16:25.901
Blast it! If we are all doomed,
at least you should be free!

16:26.068 --> 16:27.111
-Free?
-Yes!

16:27.319 --> 16:31.782
So that you can go and thrive
in our very limited time left!

16:31.865 --> 16:33.993
Quickly! Go!

16:34.076 --> 16:35.244
Embrace life!

16:35.452 --> 16:36.620
Begone, I said!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.789
Shoo! Shoo!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.458
[chuckling]

16:41.542 --> 16:43.836
I like you.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.879
He likes me?

16:45.963 --> 16:49.883
My word. The gargantuan brute likes me.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.513
[Douxie] Reflecting, my king?

16:55.014 --> 16:58.809
I was convinced magic had taken
everything from me...

16:59.601 --> 17:01.270
but it was my own doing.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.898
I tried to protect my people

17:05.899 --> 17:08.652
at the expense of so many others.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.906
Morgana was right.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.034
She wasn't evil.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.076
Brother?

17:17.202 --> 17:19.413
-I was.
-[Morgana's scream echoes]

17:19.496 --> 17:21.623
It's true you've done...

17:21.707 --> 17:23.208
questionable things,

17:23.417 --> 17:25.335
but the fight's not over yet.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.006
There's still time to make things right
for those you've wronged.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.591
Help me save them.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.011
Who are you, boy?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.263
I am Hisir--

17:36.847 --> 17:38.807
I'm nobody.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.350
History won't remember me.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.479
Stories won't be told about me,

17:43.562 --> 17:47.566
but I won't let that stop me
from fighting for what is right.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.319
You are Arthur Pendragon.

17:50.402 --> 17:55.908
No matter what happens today, I know
for a fact that your story will be told.

17:56.366 --> 18:00.537
But it's up to you
what legacy you leave behind--

18:00.662 --> 18:02.039
an epitaph...

18:02.539 --> 18:03.582
or a legend.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.752
But who will stand with me?

18:06.835 --> 18:10.172
Galahad, stands with his king!

18:10.255 --> 18:11.757
I will stand with you!

18:11.840 --> 18:13.759
[Steve] Sir Steve's got your back, King-o!

18:13.926 --> 18:15.928
-And I.
-You'll need air support.

18:19.723 --> 18:24.269
Then let Camelot be remembered
as the warriors we were born.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.687
[all] Huzzah!

18:29.274 --> 18:30.275
[both grunt]

18:30.567 --> 18:31.819
[amulet whirring]

18:31.902 --> 18:32.986
Callista...

18:33.987 --> 18:35.239
Ugh!

18:39.409 --> 18:40.327
Ugh!

18:40.828 --> 18:43.956
[chuckles] It'll keep doing that,
trust me.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.249
It chose you.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.292
Your haunted clock's wrong, Jim.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.878
Why would anything believe I'm a hero?

18:49.962 --> 18:53.966
[Merlin's voice] <i>Trollhunter,</i>
<i>rise and become.</i>

18:54.466 --> 18:56.468
Maybe it knows something you don't.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.720
How am I supposed to lead
a bunch of Trolls

18:58.804 --> 19:01.348
who don't give a slorr's knuckle about me?

19:01.431 --> 19:04.143
You know, I was chosen to be a hero, too,

19:04.226 --> 19:05.602
and no one liked it either.

19:05.686 --> 19:08.605
They called me "Jim the Baby-Handed."

19:08.689 --> 19:09.982
At least you had that.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.568
I'm nothing-- no village, no family.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.069
I don't even have a real name.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.823
I've seen you break out of Camelot,
outrun a legion of knights,

19:17.906 --> 19:20.659
and save a crazy
time-traveling Troll like me.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.870
I still think you're crazy, by the way.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.872
I'm afraid, Jim.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.125
My friends taught me
it's okay to be afraid,

19:28.333 --> 19:31.962
'cause you can do anything,
even make a name for yourself.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.092
Jim, the sun. Time to go.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.927
Hope to see you on the battlefield.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.388
We need you... Trollhunter.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.017
[gasps]

19:45.851 --> 19:46.685
"Deya"...

19:47.436 --> 19:51.064
-I like it. I remember that name.
-[amulet whirs]

19:51.148 --> 19:55.277
[Merlin's voice] <i>Rise, Deya,</i>
<i>the Trollhunter.</i>

20:00.949 --> 20:02.284
[growling in distance]

20:03.869 --> 20:06.288
[yelling]

20:07.206 --> 20:11.627
One king cannot stand
against an army, Arthur!

20:13.045 --> 20:13.962
[snarling]

20:14.463 --> 20:16.131
It's a good thing he has an army!

20:17.758 --> 20:18.884
[horse neighs]

20:23.764 --> 20:27.309
Perfect! More meat for my troops.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.520
Berserkers, tenderize them!

20:31.104 --> 20:32.940
Living cannonballs! Look alive!

20:34.733 --> 20:35.859
[soldier yells]

20:36.318 --> 20:39.988
-[grunts]
-We must hold Killahead Bridge,

20:40.072 --> 20:43.033
no matter what nightmares
Gunmar throws at us.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.368
Come on, Cal.

20:44.868 --> 20:45.953
We need you.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.832
Arthur, I can smell your fear!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.960
[Gumm-Gumm] It's leaking
out of his pantaloons!

20:53.043 --> 20:55.128
[Gumm-Gumms laughing]

20:55.462 --> 20:57.422
Prepare to be crushed!

20:57.506 --> 21:01.385
-Today's as good as any to die.
-[horse neighs]

21:01.843 --> 21:04.054
Though I never learned to read.

21:04.137 --> 21:09.059
[sighs] Aja, if you ever get this,
these are my last words...

21:09.351 --> 21:10.435
sad face.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.603
Send.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.022
[Gumm-Gumms growling]

21:17.317 --> 21:19.152
Knights of the Round Table,

21:19.236 --> 21:22.072
our battle cry will shake the heavens

21:22.406 --> 21:25.117
and awake the old gods to witness.

21:25.200 --> 21:30.330
Today, we say "no more"
to fear and darkness!

21:30.706 --> 21:34.042
-For Camelot and glory!
-[all cheering]

21:34.251 --> 21:37.587
I know the Trollhunter isn't here,
but we are!

21:37.671 --> 21:38.714
Champions!

21:38.797 --> 21:41.675
And when I get us all home,
brunch on me!

21:41.758 --> 21:43.927
-For Camelot!
-[both] For Camelot!

21:44.011 --> 21:47.597
USA! US-- uh...

21:47.681 --> 21:50.559
Cam-e-lot! Cam-e-lot!

21:50.642 --> 21:53.770
Hisirdoux, our fates may be uncertain,

21:53.854 --> 21:56.356
but there's one thing I am sure of--

21:56.440 --> 21:58.275
I chose you well.

21:58.358 --> 22:01.611
Let's show these blokes
the power of wizards!

22:03.947 --> 22:06.575
And so the battle begins...

22:06.658 --> 22:09.161
[Bellroc] And the reign of humanity ends.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.079
For Camelot!

22:11.413 --> 22:12.331
[horse neighs]

22:12.497 --> 22:13.332
[roaring]

22:13.457 --> 22:14.666
[yelling]

22:20.255 --> 22:21.089
[yelling]

22:22.174 --> 22:23.008
[weapons clang]

22:24.217 --> 22:27.054
[theme music playing]
