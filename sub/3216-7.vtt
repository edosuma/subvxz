Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Now, Dean. Go!

00:09.343 --> 00:11.095
-Dad's on a hunting trip.
-Ah!

00:11.303 --> 00:12.888
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:14.557 --> 00:17.810
-I swore I was done hunting.
-I can't do this alone.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.895
No! Jess!

00:20.563 --> 00:22.898
I think Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.900
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.695
No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.462
Okay. What do you think?

-Um--
-Oh, God. Too Martha Stewart?

Here. Wear this.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.644

01:00.728 --> 01:03.439
I don't know if this is really me.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.025
Lori, there's a hot chick
buried somewhere in there--

01:06.233 --> 01:08.652
Okay, okay.

So?

01:21.540 --> 01:24.752
Damn, girl, he's not gonna
know what hit him.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.298
Okay. I think
he's probably downstairs.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.885
-I'll see you later.
-Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.846
There's nothing you wouldn't do.

RICH:
Well, we can't arrive on time.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.913
If I didn't know any better, I'd think
you brought me here on purpose.

-Rich, let's go.

missing-persons data bank.

No John Does
fitting Dad's description.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.839
I even ran his plates
for traffic violations.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.092
Sam, I'm telling you,
I don't think Dad wants to be found.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.927
Check this out.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.473
It's a news item out of
Plains Courier, Ankeny, Iowa.

-Could be something interesting.
-Or nothing.

We heard one of the guys
around here got killed last week.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.799
-Yeah.
-What happened?

07:46.800 --> 07:51.054
They're saying some psycho with
a knife. Maybe a drifter passing through.

And my personal prayers of thanks go
out as well...

08:28.175 --> 08:32.429
...because I believe he died
trying to protect my daughter.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.516
And now,
as time heals all our wounds...

08:36.725 --> 08:39.478
...we should reflect
on what this tragedy means...

-Yeah.

This is my brother, Dean.

-We just transferred to the university.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.176

We just heard about what happened.

-We wanted to say how sorry we were.
-I know what you're going through.

10:00.726 --> 10:05.355
I saw someone get hurt once.

It's something you don't forget.

They're new students.

say, that was an inspiring sermon.

Tell me, Lori,
what are the police saying?

10:40.223 --> 10:42.267
Well, they don't have a lot to go on.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.644
I think they blame me for that.

-Yeah, I think she's hot too.
-No, man, there's something in her eyes.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.252
And listen to this,
she heard scratching on the roof.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.798
Found the bloody body
suspended upside down over the car.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.800
Bloody body suspended, sounds like--

11:15.008 --> 11:16.718
I know. The Hook Man Legend.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.013
It's famous. You don't think
we're dealing with the Hook Man?

11:20.222 --> 11:23.392
Every urban legend has a source.
A place where it all began.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.479
What about the phantom scratches,
tire punctures and the invisible killer?

11:27.687 --> 11:32.317
Maybe the Hook Man isn't a man at all.
What if it's some kind of spirit?

was arrested for murder.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.686
He was so angry over
the red-light district in town...

12:07.894 --> 12:10.063
...that one night
he killed 13 prostitutes.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.691

were found in their beds...

...sheets soaked with blood, others
suspended upside down from trees...

12:16.361 --> 12:19.072
...as a warning against
sins of the flesh."

12:19.281 --> 12:21.158
Get this. The murder weapon?

12:21.366 --> 12:25.996
The preacher lost his hand in an accident.
Had it replaced with a silver hook.

I'm over 18. I can live my own life.

This college thing is awesome.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.714
This wasn't really my experience.

21:37.797 --> 21:42.635
Oh, let me guess.
Library, studying, straight A's.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.097
What a geek. All right,
did you do your homework?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.726
Yeah. It was bugging me, right?
How is the Hook Man tied up with Lori?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.353
So I think I came up with something.

21:56.107 --> 22:00.319
"1932, Clergyman
Arrested for Murder."

22:01.612 --> 22:04.365
"1967, Seminarian Held
in Hippie Rampage."

22:04.615 --> 22:07.535
A pattern. In both cases,
the suspect was a man of religion...

22:07.744 --> 22:11.247
...who preached against immorality
and found himself wanted for killings...

22:11.456 --> 22:13.916
...he claimed were the work
of an invisible force.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.003
Killings carried out, get this,
with a sharp instrument.

22:17.086 --> 22:20.048
-What's the connection to Lori?
-A man of religion...

22:20.256 --> 22:23.092
...who openly preaches
against immorality?

22:23.301 --> 22:26.054
Except maybe this time instead
of saving the whole town...

22:26.262 --> 22:29.515
-...he's trying to save his only daughter.
-Reverend Sorenson.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.894
-You think he's summoning the spirit?
-Maybe.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.815
Or you know how a poltergeist
can haunt a person instead of a place?

22:38.024 --> 22:42.195
The spirit latches on to the reverend's
repressed emotions, feeds off them.

22:43.321 --> 22:46.115
Without the reverend
ever even knowing it.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.203
Either way, you should keep
an eye on Lori tonight.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.497
What about you?

22:57.043 --> 23:00.171
I'm gonna go see if I can
find that unmarked grave.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.997
(TWIG SNAPS)

23:58.938 --> 24:01.566
Here we go.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.793
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

24:38.186 --> 24:41.314
That's it. Next time...

24:41.522 --> 24:44.233
...I get to watch the cute girl's house.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.832
Hello, preacher.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.477
I saw you from upstairs.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.480
What are you doing here?

25:23.981 --> 25:26.108
Keeping an eye on the place.

25:28.486 --> 25:31.030
-I was worried.
-About me?

25:31.239 --> 25:32.740
Yeah. Sorry.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.994
Oh, it's cool.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.914
I already called the cops.

25:41.249 --> 25:44.460
No, seriously. I think you're sweet.

25:44.669 --> 25:49.257
Which is probably why you should
run away from me as fast as you can.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.885
Why would you say that?

25:53.135 --> 25:55.680
It's like I'm cursed or something.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.015
People around me keep dying.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.771
I think I know how you feel.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.549
Goodbye, preacher.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.982
No one will talk to me anymore.
Except you.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.027
The sheriff thinks I'm a suspect.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.572
And you know what my dad will say?
"Pray. Have faith."

26:54.989 --> 26:57.325
What does he know about faith?

26:59.535 --> 27:02.204
I heard you guys fighting before.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.041
He's seeing a woman.

27:05.124 --> 27:09.086
A married woman. I just found out.

27:09.211 --> 27:13.674
She comes to our church
with her husband. I know her kids.

27:13.924 --> 27:17.762
And he talks to me about religion?
About morality?

27:19.221 --> 27:23.601
It's like, on one hand, you know,
just do what you want and be happy.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.146
But he taught me,
raised me to believe...

27:27.355 --> 27:30.649
...that if you do something wrong,
you will get punished.

27:34.445 --> 27:37.239
I just don't know
what to think anymore.

28:06.018 --> 28:09.688
-Sam?
-Lori, I can't.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.650
That someone you lost?

28:16.612 --> 28:18.239
I'm sorry.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.157
Lori.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.744
Come inside. Please.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.414
I'll come in when I'm ready.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.707
Unh.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.376

28:38.217 --> 28:40.136
REVEREND:
No! No, please!

28:40.219 --> 28:42.805
Please! No!

28:49.395 --> 28:50.855
No! No, no!

28:55.568 --> 28:57.319
Dad! Dad!

29:02.241 --> 29:06.287
Okay. Okay, Dad, it's okay.
It's okay.

29:10.249 --> 29:14.003
We were just talking.
Then Lori's dad came out...

29:14.253 --> 29:15.629
...and then he appeared.

29:15.796 --> 29:19.550
SHERIFF: A big man. Carrying a weapon,
some kind of a hook.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.427
Yes, sir.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.804
You ever see him before?

29:24.305 --> 29:26.432
No, sir.

29:27.141 --> 29:30.394
Son, seems every time I turn around,
I'm seeing you.

29:31.145 --> 29:34.690
-I suggest you try to stay out of trouble.
-Yes, sir.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.526
COP: Hold on there, son.
-It's all right. I'm with him.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.029
That's my brother. That's--
Hey, brother.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.786
-Let him through.
-Thanks.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.290
Go ahead.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.462
-You okay?
-Yeah.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.006
-What the hell happened?
-Hook Man.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.050
-You saw him?
-Damn right.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.636
-Why didn't you torch the bones?
-What? I did.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.306
-You sure it's the spirit of Jacob Carnes?
-Sure as hell looked like him.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.518
That's not all. I don't think
it's latching on to the reverend.

30:10.726 --> 30:14.230
Well, yeah. The guy wouldn't send
the Hook Man after himself.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.816
I think it's latching on to Lori.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.487
Last night, she found out that her father
is having an affair with a woman.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.697
-So what?
-So she's upset about it.

30:23.864 --> 30:27.576
She's upset about the immorality of it.
She was raised to believe...

30:27.660 --> 30:30.412
...if you do something wrong,
you get punished.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.164
Okay, so she's conflicted.

30:32.373 --> 30:35.626
And the spirit of Carnes is latching
on to her repressed emotions.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.379
-Maybe he's doing the punishing for her?
-Right.

30:38.462 --> 30:42.007
Rich comes on too strong, Taylor
tries to make her into a party girl...

30:42.216 --> 30:43.551
...Dad has an affair.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.720
Remind me not to piss this girl off.

30:47.972 --> 30:52.017
But I burned those bones. I buried them
in salt. Why didn't that stop him?

30:52.977 --> 30:55.062
You must have missed something.

30:55.813 --> 30:58.732
No. I burned everything in that coffin.

30:59.108 --> 31:00.734
Did you get the hook?

31:02.361 --> 31:04.280
The hook?

31:04.738 --> 31:07.825
It was the murder weapon.
And in a way, it was part of him.

31:10.786 --> 31:14.081
So like the bones,
the hook is a source of his power.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.250
So if we find the hook...

31:16.458 --> 31:18.752
BOTH:
...we stop the Hook Man.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.721
Here's something, I think.

31:28.804 --> 31:32.891
Logbook, Iowa State Penitentiary.
"Carnes, Jacob. Personal effects...

31:32.975 --> 31:35.853
-...disposition thereof."
-Does it mention the hook?

31:35.936 --> 31:39.231
Yeah, maybe. "Upon execution,
all earthly items shall be remanded...

31:39.315 --> 31:43.235
...to the Prisoner's House of Worship,
St. Barnabus Church."

31:43.319 --> 31:46.488
-Isn't that where Lori's father preaches?
-Yeah.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.865
Where Lori lives?

31:48.282 --> 31:52.494
Maybe that's why he's been haunting
reverends and reverends' daughters.

31:52.703 --> 31:55.914
If the hook were there, don't you think
someone might have seen it?

31:56.123 --> 31:58.667
I mean, a blood-stained,
silver-handled hook?

32:00.711 --> 32:03.547
Check the church records.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.675
SAM:
"St. Barnabus, donations, 1862.

32:06.759 --> 32:10.971
Received: silver-handled hook
from state penitentiary.

32:11.055 --> 32:13.307
Reforged."

32:13.515 --> 32:17.269
They melted it down.
Made it into something else.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.203
DEAN: We can't take any chances.
Anything silver goes in the fire.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.330
I agree.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.749
Lori's still at the hospital.
We'll have to break in.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.334
All right. Take your pick.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.796
-I'll take the house.
-Okay.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.216
Hey.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.386
Stay out of her underwear drawer.

33:07.486 --> 33:11.198
-I got everything that even looked silver.
-Better safe than sorry.

-What are you doing here?
-What is it?

34:05.961 --> 34:10.007
I've been trying to understand
what's been happening. Why.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.427
Now I know,
so I'm praying for forgiveness.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.888
Forgiveness for what?

34:15.971 --> 34:19.933
Don't you see?
I'm to blame for all this.

34:20.017 --> 34:22.561
I've read in the Bible
about avenging angels.

34:22.770 --> 34:26.774
Trust me. This guy, he's no angel.

34:27.608 --> 34:30.694
I was so angry at my father.

34:30.903 --> 34:33.113
Part of me wanted him punished.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.200
And then he came
and he punished him.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.620
-It's not your fault.
-Yes, it is.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.289
I don't know how, but it is.

34:43.874 --> 34:48.212
I killed Rich. Taylor too.
I nearly killed my father.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.422
Lori.

34:51.465 --> 34:53.425
I can see it now.

34:53.634 --> 34:57.095
They didn't deserve to be punished.
I do.

-So did I.

-Then why is he still here?
-Well, maybe we missed something.

36:25.517 --> 36:29.062
-Lori, where did you get that chain?
-My father gave it to me.

36:29.271 --> 36:32.733
-Where'd your dad get it?
-He said it was a church heirloom.

-Is it silver?
-Yes!

-Yes, I told you. We all saw him.
