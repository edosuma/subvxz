00:02.140 --> 00:04.211
<i>Previously on
"The Rookie: Feds"...</i>

00:04.211 --> 00:05.626
This is our target,
Tobias Kazan.

00:05.626 --> 00:08.146
He runs the largest fentanyl
syndicate in the Southland.

00:08.146 --> 00:09.354
That's his wife, Cora.

00:09.354 --> 00:11.321
They've been married
21 years.

00:11.321 --> 00:13.013
That's his daughter, Aliz.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.324
She's a little ratchet.

00:14.324 --> 00:15.946
Out of my way.
She's my daughter.

00:15.946 --> 00:18.984
Your daughter is the prime
suspect in her own kidnapping

00:18.984 --> 00:21.262
and the kidnapping
of Kellen Filmore.

00:21.262 --> 00:24.093
And for the murder
of Tony Eakins.

00:24.093 --> 00:25.818
You came at me
through my kid.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.234
I won't forget that.

00:27.234 --> 00:29.132
If I were you, I'd get her
a really good lawyer.

00:29.132 --> 00:32.515
As far as Tobias goes,
we'll get him one day.

00:33.550 --> 00:37.071
My darling.
Finally, we are together.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.315
And on Valentine's Day.

00:39.315 --> 00:42.007
An ocean couldn't keep us
apart, Loretta.

00:42.007 --> 00:43.250
It's fate.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.666
I don't know
if it's the champagne,

00:45.666 --> 00:48.358
but my head is spinning.

00:48.358 --> 00:50.740
I mean,
just six weeks ago,

00:50.740 --> 00:53.398
you were
a ClipMates profile.

00:53.398 --> 00:58.368
And now I'm sitting across
from the love of my life.

00:58.368 --> 01:00.681
God, she always
lays it on so thick.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.993
You know you men love
your compliments.

01:02.993 --> 01:03.994
Whenever you're ready.

01:03.994 --> 01:04.995
No, no, no. Um...

01:04.995 --> 01:06.100
I'll take it.
- Thank you.
- Oh.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.653
You know
that pains me.

01:07.653 --> 01:09.862
It's just that my enemies
have tied up my fortune

01:09.862 --> 01:11.864
with their
frivolous lawsuits.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.522
But as soon
as I am victorious,

01:14.522 --> 01:18.388
I am taking you
to Firenze, Italia.

01:18.388 --> 01:20.010
Mamma mia!

01:20.010 --> 01:23.048
Until then, I got it.
I know you're good for it.

01:23.048 --> 01:24.187
<i>You're doing
great, Simone,</i>

01:24.187 --> 01:25.671
but pretending
to be a rich man

01:25.671 --> 01:27.190
and taking gifts
is not a crime.

01:27.190 --> 01:28.674
Remember, to get him
on wire fraud,

01:28.674 --> 01:30.366
he has to ask for money
for his fake corporation,

01:30.366 --> 01:32.609
which you need to send
and he has to accept.

01:32.609 --> 01:34.646
You got him on the hook,
so let's reel him in.

01:34.646 --> 01:36.924
What's the matter, darling?
Is everything okay?

01:36.924 --> 01:40.410
Well, I told you
coming here is dangerous.

01:40.410 --> 01:42.240
That's why I have
to travel covertly.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.862
I-Is there anything
I can do?

01:43.862 --> 01:46.589
A slight injection of funds
right now would help me

01:46.589 --> 01:48.384
stay one step ahead
of my enemies.

01:48.384 --> 01:49.419
Of course.

01:49.419 --> 01:51.525
Well, how much
do you need?

01:51.525 --> 01:54.010
$25,000 should
more than suffice.

01:54.010 --> 01:55.149
<i>Okay.</i>

01:55.149 --> 01:56.702
Where should
I send it, my love?

01:56.702 --> 01:58.635
My company's account
should be easiest.

01:59.843 --> 02:02.467
Ah. Got it.

02:02.467 --> 02:05.642
You, my dear,
are a lifesaver.

02:05.642 --> 02:08.335
And <i>you,</i> my dear,

02:08.335 --> 02:09.612
are under arrest.

02:09.612 --> 02:11.131

02:59.834 --> 03:01.353
Don't let them do this.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.184
Yes, sir.

03:05.737 --> 03:06.945
I bust my ass for months

03:06.945 --> 03:08.360
to get close
to the ClipMates Casanova,

03:08.360 --> 03:09.534
and you bogart my arrest?

03:09.534 --> 03:10.535
Our case takes priority.

03:10.535 --> 03:11.846
I got on to this guy

03:11.846 --> 03:13.158
after he played
a widow's lonely heart

03:13.158 --> 03:14.780
and conned her
out of a hundred grand,

03:14.780 --> 03:15.988
then I found
five other women

03:15.988 --> 03:17.231
he scammed
from here to Dubai.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.474
I've got files,
interviews--

03:18.474 --> 03:19.716
That all sounds great.

03:19.716 --> 03:22.202
Now please send it over
when you get a chance.

03:23.375 --> 03:26.206
You're not interested
in his romance scam.

03:27.276 --> 03:28.656
You're on to him
for something else.

03:28.656 --> 03:30.727
Detective Voss,
I do appreciate

03:30.727 --> 03:32.833
all of the hard work
that you've--You want to
blow me off, fine.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.387
This man has ruined
women's lives.

03:35.387 --> 03:37.907
Whatever you're up to,
you better do right by them.

03:38.839 --> 03:40.185
Can I?
Yeah.

03:40.185 --> 03:41.221
Hey.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.671
My name is Simone,

03:43.671 --> 03:46.226
and I'm sorry about
what happened back there.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.849
Just tell me you snagged him
for a good reason.

03:48.849 --> 03:53.025
You didn't hear it from me,
but we're after Tobias Kazan.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.510
That's major.
Keep talking.

03:54.510 --> 03:56.822
Well, a few months back,
we crippled his operation.

03:56.822 --> 03:59.894
But word on the street
is he's planning something big.

03:59.894 --> 04:01.620
What's that got to do
with my case?

04:01.620 --> 04:03.346
Tobias tripled
his security,

04:03.346 --> 04:06.073
so it's been damn near
impossible to get to him,

04:06.073 --> 04:09.249
so we've been tracking him
through his wife.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.629
She's a Casanova victim.

04:10.629 --> 04:12.976
But keep it on the low?

04:12.976 --> 04:14.806
Thanks for
the straight answer.

04:20.777 --> 04:22.123
Ooh, uh,
hold the door, please.

04:22.123 --> 04:23.263
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.093
Ooh!
Beautiful flowers.

04:26.093 --> 04:28.371
I can't believe it's, like,
the first time

04:28.371 --> 04:29.924
in, what, 30 years

04:29.924 --> 04:32.030
that I'm not gonna have
somebody to love up on

04:32.030 --> 04:33.721
for Valentine's Day.

04:33.721 --> 04:35.136
Unlike you, B.

04:35.136 --> 04:36.793
No, Antoinette doesn't like
Valentine's Day,

04:36.793 --> 04:38.208
so I'm cool.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.900
I'm not supposed to do anything
for Fortune, right?

04:39.900 --> 04:42.005
I mean, we've only gone out
a few times.

04:43.248 --> 04:44.387
What?

04:45.354 --> 04:47.356
Being married on Valentine's Day
was so much easier.

04:47.356 --> 04:50.082
My wife would lay out
all the rules a week before,

04:50.082 --> 04:51.256
so I always knew
what to do.

04:51.256 --> 04:52.809
Valentine's Day
is so lame.

04:52.809 --> 04:55.398
It's just another day
of insincere overtures.

04:55.398 --> 04:57.089
But all the sheeple
continue to fall for it.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.539
Well, I love it.

04:58.539 --> 05:00.679
And there's no shame
in my nosy game, sir.

05:00.679 --> 05:01.991
Who are those for?

05:01.991 --> 05:04.304
Oh, um, someone
named Laura Stinton?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.546
Stensen?

05:05.546 --> 05:07.652
Aah! Oh, my God!

05:07.652 --> 05:11.345
Oh, what?
Atlas-- so sweet.

05:12.519 --> 05:13.761
Thank you, kind sir.

05:13.761 --> 05:16.350
I hope you have
a really nice Valentine's Day.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.559
He even remembered marigolds
are my birth month flower.

05:19.629 --> 05:21.838
Happy Valentine's Day.

05:21.838 --> 05:23.081
Hi.

05:23.081 --> 05:24.427
I know you said
you don't care

05:24.427 --> 05:25.566
about Valentine's Day,

05:25.566 --> 05:26.567
but I had to
get you something,

05:26.567 --> 05:28.086
so... here you go.

05:29.156 --> 05:31.607
"I like you
hot or cold."

05:31.607 --> 05:34.368
You know,
like the pizza.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.921
It's good either way.

05:35.921 --> 05:37.440
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.339
Uh, I get
all of that now.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.340
Great.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.514
Thanks.
It's... cute.

05:42.514 --> 05:43.964
Yeah, thanks.

05:43.964 --> 05:45.862
Uh, so I'm-- I'm so glad
we're on the same page

05:45.862 --> 05:47.485
about this whole
Valentine's thing.

05:47.485 --> 05:50.350
You know,
just keep it casual.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.006
Just a regular
old Tuesday.

05:52.006 --> 05:53.801
Indeed.
Yeah.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.285
So, you still coming over
tonight?

05:55.285 --> 05:58.427
Do a little ramen,
watch a documentary?

05:58.427 --> 06:00.636
Yes. Uh, 8:00?
Great.

06:00.636 --> 06:03.397
Uh, you got a secret admirer
I should know about?

06:03.397 --> 06:05.710
Oh, Jackie's husband
always sends her

06:05.710 --> 06:06.883
a bunch of gifts
throughout the day.

06:06.883 --> 06:08.229
It's a big old
waste of money

06:08.229 --> 06:09.369
on things you're gonna
throw away

06:09.369 --> 06:10.577
two days later,
you know?

06:10.577 --> 06:12.268
No, thank you.

06:12.268 --> 06:13.821
I'll see you later, alright?

06:13.821 --> 06:15.996
It's not a crime
to date multiple women.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.929
Rude? True.

06:17.929 --> 06:19.655
But against the law?

06:19.655 --> 06:21.104
I don't think so.

06:21.104 --> 06:26.351
How about fraud, forgery,
theft, for starters.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.388
And all of those
on an international scale.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.528
You lie about
who you are, what you do,

06:30.528 --> 06:34.877
con women into giving your
fake business money... Duncan.

06:34.877 --> 06:36.568
I--
Don't say a word.

06:36.568 --> 06:38.467
They can't make
any of this stick.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.640
We literally
caught him conning

06:39.640 --> 06:41.021
one of our
undercover agents.

06:41.021 --> 06:44.334
No way. If anything,
Loretta conned me.

06:44.334 --> 06:46.233
He's telling the truth
about that.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.303
I'm good.

06:47.303 --> 06:48.649
And so humble.

06:51.687 --> 06:52.722
Carter Hope.

06:52.722 --> 06:54.552
Yes. Hi.

06:54.552 --> 06:56.243
Oh, that's right.

06:56.243 --> 06:57.658
Uh, I'm gonna need
to cancel that.

06:57.658 --> 07:00.316
My wife and I...

07:00.316 --> 07:02.318
What do you mean,
it's non-refundable?

07:02.318 --> 07:04.216
No, I know what
the word means. It--

07:04.216 --> 07:06.391
Never mind.

07:06.391 --> 07:07.599
What's non-refundable?

07:07.599 --> 07:09.083
Last Valentine's Day,

07:09.083 --> 07:11.534
I messed up with Evelyn,
like, really bad,

07:11.534 --> 07:13.398
so I figured I'd plan ahead
for this year,

07:13.398 --> 07:14.917
save future me
from grief,

07:14.917 --> 07:17.713
so I made reservations
at Ravenna for tonight.

07:17.713 --> 07:20.301
The chef's table's so exclusive,
I had to pre-pay--

07:20.301 --> 07:21.475
$500 a head.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.270
Well,
that's perfect.
What?

07:23.270 --> 07:26.480
Well, you got the dinner
reservations in the divorce.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.276
You forgot to give Fortune
a Valentine's Day gift,

07:29.276 --> 07:32.762
so looks like past you
just hooked future you up.

07:32.762 --> 07:34.108
It's too much
too soon, right?

07:34.108 --> 07:35.593
I mean,
we're barely dating.

07:35.593 --> 07:38.596
Are you hearing
yourself, Carter?

07:38.596 --> 07:40.632
This is the thing
that can lock it in.

07:40.632 --> 07:44.222
Look, we can prove that
you conned multiple women,

07:44.222 --> 07:46.742
but right now, we only want
to talk about one of them--

07:46.742 --> 07:48.295
Cora Kazan.

07:48.295 --> 07:49.572
She's married--

07:49.572 --> 07:52.437
to a very dangerous
drug kingpin.

07:52.437 --> 07:54.474
Ah. Look at that.
He wasn't aware of that.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.165
She told me
he was a businessman,

07:56.165 --> 07:57.891
had his own company.

07:57.891 --> 08:00.169
Yeah, manufacturing and
distributing methamphetamines

08:00.169 --> 08:02.205
and killing a bunch of people
in the process.

08:02.205 --> 08:03.621
You got two paths.

08:03.621 --> 08:05.519
One, we pack you off
to an American prison,

08:05.519 --> 08:08.039
where you never step foot
in your homeland ever again.

08:08.039 --> 08:11.283
Or two, you help us get to
Cora's husband, Tobias,

08:11.283 --> 08:12.699
and you go home.

08:12.699 --> 08:15.322
How about three?
We fight this in court.

08:15.322 --> 08:17.186
Sure, but that might
trigger four--

08:17.186 --> 08:20.327
Tobias greenlights a hit on your
client for screwing his wife.

08:20.327 --> 08:21.811
- I'll help.
- Absolutely not.

08:21.811 --> 08:23.675
It's my life.

08:23.675 --> 08:25.470
I'll do it.

08:25.470 --> 08:27.230
Just tell me
what I have to do.

08:27.230 --> 08:30.371
You are going
to give her this gift.

08:30.371 --> 08:32.304
Really?
A literal Trojan horse?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.478
It's Celtic.

08:33.478 --> 08:34.755
It's a symbol
of good fortune--

08:34.755 --> 08:36.723
something our Casanova here
should have no problem

08:36.723 --> 08:38.483
making up
a really good story about.

08:38.483 --> 08:39.484
And what is it really?

08:39.484 --> 08:40.968
A Wi-Fi hacker.

08:40.968 --> 08:42.763
Give it to her,
tell her to put it in the house.

08:42.763 --> 08:44.282
When she looks at her husband,
she thinks of you,

08:44.282 --> 08:45.835
or-- or whatever.

08:45.835 --> 08:47.975
And meanwhile, we're tapping
into their home network

08:47.975 --> 08:50.184
and intercepting
all communications.

08:50.184 --> 08:51.358
Fine.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.671
Your phone.

08:55.086 --> 08:56.674
Arrange a meeting
with Cora--

08:56.674 --> 08:58.503
today, in person.

08:58.503 --> 08:59.711
But it's Valentine's Day.

08:59.711 --> 09:01.126
She's probably
with her husband.

09:01.126 --> 09:02.576
Then make sure
that she chooses you.

09:07.305 --> 09:08.893
Hi, Amy.

09:08.893 --> 09:10.204
What a surprise.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.586
Darling,
can you get away?

09:12.586 --> 09:14.243
Today's tough.

09:14.243 --> 09:17.453
Could we do Pilates and mimosas
tomorrow morning?

09:19.144 --> 09:20.698
I can't wait.

09:20.698 --> 09:23.597
I need my lips on your neck

09:23.597 --> 09:27.256
in that spot that you love,
just under your ear.

09:29.499 --> 09:30.949
I'll make it work.

09:30.949 --> 09:32.882
Text me
when and where.

09:37.162 --> 09:38.474
I still think
we should be the ones

09:38.474 --> 09:40.234
surveilling Cora's date
with Chase.

09:40.234 --> 09:42.064
The surveillance team
is top-notch.

09:42.064 --> 09:44.445
Plus, Cora already
knows what we look like.

09:44.445 --> 09:46.586
Why risk her
making one of us?

09:51.211 --> 09:53.178
Is that another present
from Atlas?

09:53.178 --> 09:54.663
Yes, but I'm the only one

09:54.663 --> 09:55.940
with a key
to this drawer.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.044
How'd it get in there?

09:57.044 --> 09:58.459
Did one of you help him?

09:58.459 --> 10:00.530
Wasn't me.
Not me.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.671
I am dating a cat burglar.

10:04.293 --> 10:05.605
Oh!

10:05.605 --> 10:08.297
A dreamy,
romantic cat burglar.

10:08.297 --> 10:09.643
You gotta be kidding me!

10:09.643 --> 10:11.611
Well, then get him back, now!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.198
Chase just blew
through a red light,

10:13.198 --> 10:14.752
and he lost the two agents
who were escorting him

10:14.752 --> 10:15.753
to his date with Cora.

10:15.753 --> 10:16.719
He is in the wind.

10:16.719 --> 10:17.720
Any idea
where he's going?

10:17.720 --> 10:19.032
Not a clue.

10:19.032 --> 10:20.999
I bet I know someone
who might know--

10:20.999 --> 10:23.519
the one person who's been
on his tail for months.

10:32.079 --> 10:33.633
Appreciate this, Detective.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.531
Couldn't wait
to get my gloat on.

10:35.531 --> 10:36.601
Boat slip U-1.

10:36.601 --> 10:38.189
There's a yacht
being leased

10:38.189 --> 10:40.847
by one of Mr. Bad Romance's
shell corporations.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.094
LAPD!

10:47.094 --> 10:48.233
FBI!

10:48.233 --> 10:49.649
We're coming on board!

11:05.043 --> 11:06.873
Oh, no.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.708
You should have
listened to me.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.606
If you hadn't stolen my case,
this guy would be in lockup,

11:16.606 --> 11:17.918
and I'd be getting restitution
for his victims.

11:17.918 --> 11:20.093
Okay, someone please tell me
that they got a lead.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.682
No sign of a struggle, which
means he either knew his killer,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.338
or they got
the drop on him.

11:24.338 --> 11:25.512
And they used a weapon
found in the boat,

11:25.512 --> 11:28.273
all pointing to a crime
of opportunity.

11:28.273 --> 11:29.447
Alright, well,
he ditches us,

11:29.447 --> 11:30.620
he tries to get away
on his boat,

11:30.620 --> 11:32.450
and then someone catches him
before he can.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.970
Yeah, but he has screwed over
so many ladies,

11:34.970 --> 11:36.696
we are not short
on suspects.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.904
Where do we start?

11:37.904 --> 11:39.284
How about Cora Kazan?

11:39.284 --> 11:40.665
I just got off the phone
with surveillance.

11:40.665 --> 11:42.011
She didn't show up
to the hotel to meet him.

11:42.011 --> 11:43.944
That's far from proof she came
here and harpooned him.

11:43.944 --> 11:46.326
Agreed. But she has a FastTrak
on her car for tolls.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.777
She got off the 110 freeway
heading to the marina

11:48.777 --> 11:49.985
less than
two hours ago.

11:49.985 --> 11:51.676
Let's get her in here
for questioning. Now.

11:51.676 --> 11:53.022
Since I clearly know more

11:53.022 --> 11:55.024
about the victim/former suspect
than you,

11:55.024 --> 11:56.301
would you like me
to observe?

11:56.301 --> 11:57.578
Actually, I--
Great.

11:57.578 --> 11:59.408
I'll meet you
at your office.

11:59.408 --> 12:01.410
Damn!

12:01.410 --> 12:03.412
And you complained
about me.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.003
If you think you can get me
to give you dirt on my husband,

12:08.003 --> 12:09.487
you're crazy.

12:09.487 --> 12:11.834
Mm. Crazy is being married
to a psychopath

12:11.834 --> 12:14.043
and cheating on him
with a con man.

12:14.043 --> 12:16.666
Yes. We know about
Chase Harrison.

12:16.666 --> 12:19.014
And we know that he contacted
you earlier for a hookup,

12:19.014 --> 12:20.498
and then two hours later,
he's dead

12:20.498 --> 12:22.707
with a spear-gun arrow
through his heart.

12:22.707 --> 12:23.915
He's dead?

12:23.915 --> 12:25.192
Yeah.

12:25.192 --> 12:26.435
I want a lawyer.

12:26.435 --> 12:27.850
You can go that way,

12:27.850 --> 12:29.334
but then your husband's gonna
find out about the affair,

12:29.334 --> 12:31.785
and we both know he's not
gonna take that too well, so...

12:31.785 --> 12:34.512
Safer bet-- you just
come clean with us.

12:34.512 --> 12:35.755
I didn't kill him.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.860
We know you set up
a rendezvous.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.966
He called me back an hour later
and changed the plan.

12:39.966 --> 12:41.277
Did you know that?

12:42.244 --> 12:43.383
No.

12:43.383 --> 12:46.662
He called me from a new number,
which was odd.

12:46.662 --> 12:48.181
He said
he was in trouble

12:48.181 --> 12:50.217
and needed me to meet him
at the marina.

12:50.217 --> 12:51.840
What else did he say?

12:51.840 --> 12:54.394
Duncan wanted
to sail away with me.

12:54.394 --> 12:56.189
You knew
his real name?

12:56.189 --> 12:57.569
Yes.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.261
Busted him
on our first date.

12:59.261 --> 13:00.814
So you knew exactly
what he was doing

13:00.814 --> 13:02.816
and you still
gave him money.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.817
Why?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.474
Because burning
Tobias's money

13:05.474 --> 13:07.441
was almost as satisfying
as the sex.

13:09.443 --> 13:11.860
But mostly, I did it because
Duncan and I were in love.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.241
Unbelievable.

13:14.241 --> 13:16.450
She knew who he was
and still fell for his lies.

13:16.450 --> 13:18.073
How do you know
he's lying?

13:18.073 --> 13:19.902
Even con men
can fall in love.

13:19.902 --> 13:22.284
Because this guy knew more
than anyone that love is a scam.

13:22.284 --> 13:24.631
Wow, Negative Naomi.

13:24.631 --> 13:26.219
Think about it.

13:26.219 --> 13:28.497
If our victim didn't have
real feelings for her,

13:28.497 --> 13:30.775
he would have given her
the Trojan horse gift

13:30.775 --> 13:31.845
and walked away.

13:31.845 --> 13:32.846
But he didn't.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.089
You're wrong.
I'm right.

13:34.089 --> 13:35.780
- No, you're wrong.
- No, I am right,
and you--

13:35.780 --> 13:37.092
Would you two
cut the bickering?

13:37.092 --> 13:38.576
I'm trying to listen.

13:38.576 --> 13:40.129
I'm right.

13:40.129 --> 13:42.200
<i>Tell us what happened
when you met up at the marina.</i>

13:42.200 --> 13:44.651
I never met him.

13:44.651 --> 13:46.273
I couldn't find
his yacht.

13:46.273 --> 13:49.104
I tried calling that phone
number, but he didn't pick up.

13:49.104 --> 13:51.244
Cora, do you expect us
to believe that?

13:51.244 --> 13:55.765
I don't care what you believe.
What we had was real.

13:55.765 --> 13:57.112
You were gonna go
with him?

13:57.112 --> 14:00.667
I wanted to,
but no.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.669
My daughter is in prison
and needs me.

14:02.669 --> 14:04.222
So, why did you go
to the marina, then,

14:04.222 --> 14:06.293
if you weren't gonna
sail off with him?

14:06.293 --> 14:07.708
To say goodbye.

14:09.193 --> 14:11.298
Cora, don't say
another word.

14:11.298 --> 14:13.991
Unless you're arresting
Mrs. Kazan, we're leaving.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.544
Her husband's waiting for her
in the lobby.

14:15.544 --> 14:16.890
Of course he is.

14:25.623 --> 14:27.383
Garza.

14:27.383 --> 14:29.282
You've already taken
my daughter from me,

14:29.282 --> 14:30.904
now you're coming
for my wife.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.837
How far do you think
you can push a man

14:32.837 --> 14:34.735
before he decides
to push back?

14:34.735 --> 14:36.185
Careful, Tobias.

14:36.185 --> 14:38.360
You're just a few words shy
of threatening a federal agent.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.949
Yeah, but that would be
such an unsatisfying way

14:40.949 --> 14:43.330
for you to end up
in handcuffs.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.125
So unless you're willing
to escalate

14:45.125 --> 14:46.955
to assaulting
a peace officer,

14:46.955 --> 14:49.026
you should go.

14:49.026 --> 14:51.200
Hmm.

14:54.341 --> 14:55.722
When you're looking into
Cora's alibi,

14:55.722 --> 14:57.551
check out Tobias's,
as well.

14:57.551 --> 15:00.106
Because if he knew that she was
cheating on him with Chase,

15:00.106 --> 15:01.935
he has certainly
killed for less.

15:01.935 --> 15:02.936
Mm.

15:09.046 --> 15:11.186
Seriously?
Atlas again?

15:11.186 --> 15:13.188
Hey, no. It's not for you.
It's for him.

15:13.188 --> 15:14.430
For me?
Yeah.

15:14.430 --> 15:16.639
- From who?
- Uh, I don't know.

15:16.639 --> 15:17.986
Mm!

15:17.986 --> 15:20.333
"Just a sweet
chocolate treat

15:20.333 --> 15:23.232
to an even sweeter
chocolate treat."

15:23.232 --> 15:24.544
It's from Fortune.

15:24.544 --> 15:25.786
You're doing
something right, Carter.

15:25.786 --> 15:29.894
Clearly not.
But I'm about to.

15:35.037 --> 15:36.383
Hey, you.

15:36.383 --> 15:38.040
Hey. I am looking
for a woman.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.283
Maybe you can
help me find her.

15:39.283 --> 15:41.423
She is kind, thoughtful,

15:41.423 --> 15:43.943
and apparently considers me
a chocolate treat.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.599
Mm. I think I know
who you're talking about.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.394
<i>That was really nice.</i>

15:47.394 --> 15:51.088
Look, I know this is
last minute, and I'm so sorry.

15:51.088 --> 15:52.675
Are you free
for dinner?

15:52.675 --> 15:54.574
Tonight?

15:54.574 --> 15:56.196
Well, maybe I can get someone
to cover me,

15:56.196 --> 15:59.372
but good luck getting in
anywhere on Valentine's Day.

15:59.372 --> 16:02.858
I...actually know someone
at Ravenna.

16:02.858 --> 16:04.515
Uh, he can get us in.

16:04.515 --> 16:07.932
Ravenna? For real?

16:07.932 --> 16:09.520
I've always wanted
to go there.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.797
What time?

16:10.797 --> 16:13.075
- Pick you up at 8:00?
- I'll be cute.

16:15.629 --> 16:17.079
What did you
tell them?

16:17.079 --> 16:19.012
Nothing about you
or your business.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.876
Not everything
is about you.

16:20.876 --> 16:23.016
So it's about
your boyfriend, then.

16:24.845 --> 16:26.088
You knew?

16:26.088 --> 16:29.091
You're not as clever
as you think.

16:29.091 --> 16:30.334
Did you--

16:32.336 --> 16:33.958
Hello?

16:33.958 --> 16:35.925
<i>This is a call
from Riverside Correctional.</i>

16:35.925 --> 16:37.168
<i>To accept the charges, say yes.</i>

16:37.168 --> 16:38.790
Yes.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.620
<i>Dad?</i> Sweetie?

16:40.620 --> 16:41.759
<i>Daddy.</i>

16:41.759 --> 16:43.243
Hey, Aliz,
what's wrong?

16:43.243 --> 16:44.865
They know who I am.

16:44.865 --> 16:46.971
Who? What are you
talking about?

16:46.971 --> 16:49.836
The Mala Noche. They found out
I'm your daughter.

16:49.836 --> 16:51.079
They've been
threatening me.

16:51.079 --> 16:52.701
You said you could
protect her.

16:52.701 --> 16:55.497
I have people inside, but
Mala Noche's running the prison.

16:55.497 --> 16:57.016
<i>What do they want?</i>

16:57.016 --> 16:59.052
Your business,
or I'm dead.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.505
Got that, Papi? <i>Listen to me.</i>

17:03.505 --> 17:05.093
If you hurt my daughter,

17:05.093 --> 17:08.234
I will kill every single person
you care about.

17:08.234 --> 17:09.752
Gotta go.
We'll be in touch

17:09.752 --> 17:10.926
after we put a beating
on your little angel.

17:10.926 --> 17:11.858
Wait.

17:19.141 --> 17:22.110
Hey. Got anything on who killed
our ClipMates Casanova?

17:22.110 --> 17:23.870
Waiting to see.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.078
ERT didn't find
any prints

17:25.078 --> 17:26.631
on the spear gun
that killed your victim,

17:26.631 --> 17:29.151
but they pulled multiple
- latent prints from the yacht.
- Okay.

17:29.151 --> 17:30.911
AFIS is searching
for a match.

17:30.911 --> 17:32.672
Well, fingers crossed.

17:32.672 --> 17:35.813
Oh, also, fingers crossed we can
find some good food tonight,

17:35.813 --> 17:38.229
'cause the ramen place
I was gonna take you to--

17:38.229 --> 17:39.989
health code
violation, so...

17:39.989 --> 17:41.301
Guess we dodged
a bullet.

17:41.301 --> 17:42.682
Yeah, totally.

17:42.682 --> 17:43.924
Uh, I was thinking maybe
we could do, like,

17:43.924 --> 17:46.548
a drive-thru on the way
to my place?

17:46.548 --> 17:50.655
Oh, yeah. Uh, fast food
sounds great.

17:50.655 --> 17:51.656
Great.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.694
We got a hit.

18:04.669 --> 18:07.810
Fingerprint match
from German Intelligence.

18:07.810 --> 18:09.364
Alright.
Hans Becker.

18:09.364 --> 18:11.400
German national suspected of
multiple murders for hire

18:11.400 --> 18:12.401
across Europe.

18:12.401 --> 18:13.506
An assassin.

18:13.506 --> 18:15.128
He just landed at LAX
late last night

18:15.128 --> 18:16.302
from Frankfurt.

18:16.302 --> 18:19.063
And just happened to end up
on our victim's yacht.

18:19.063 --> 18:21.445
What are we thinking?
Valentine's Day Massacre?

18:21.445 --> 18:24.241
All of Chase's recent marks
have deep pockets.

18:24.241 --> 18:26.139
A betrayal like that,
I wouldn't put it past them

18:26.139 --> 18:28.279
to want revenge,
hire a hitman.

18:28.279 --> 18:30.074
No, Tobias wouldn't
waste the money,

18:30.074 --> 18:31.800
and Cora didn't have time
to bring him in.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.147
Well, but Chase has been dead
for hours now.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.701
I mean, this guy could be
on his way back to Germany.

18:36.701 --> 18:38.220
I'll get a BOLO
out for him

18:38.220 --> 18:39.980
and have every agency
in the region on high alert.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.535
With any luck, we'll catch him
before he leaves town.

18:42.535 --> 18:45.986
Look, uh,
it's Valentine's Day, right,

18:45.986 --> 18:47.436
for those of you
who celebrate.

18:47.436 --> 18:50.163
So go and have a night
or whatever,

18:50.163 --> 18:51.613
and just stay
by your phones.

18:51.613 --> 18:52.959
If I get a lead,
I'm gonna call.

18:54.650 --> 18:57.170
What, you got big
Valentine's Day plans tonight?

18:57.170 --> 19:00.449
No Valentine, no plans.

19:00.449 --> 19:03.280
I lateral transferred
from Oakland PD six months ago,

19:03.280 --> 19:06.317
and I gotta say, I'm still not
vibing with the "LA thing."

19:06.317 --> 19:08.699
Just do my job
and go home.

19:08.699 --> 19:12.289
See, you just haven't given
the right people a try.

19:12.289 --> 19:16.120
Trust, once you find your folks
and a good place to hang,

19:16.120 --> 19:17.949
you gonna see LA
through different eyes.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.504
Really? Down here, there's not
even any decent restaurants,

19:20.504 --> 19:22.885
just overpriced
hot spots and sushi.

19:24.301 --> 19:26.130
Seriously, what is up
with all the sushi joints?

19:26.130 --> 19:31.480
Okay, um, try this taco truck,
Bangin' Tacos, downtown.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.276
If you love that, I'll give you
some other recommendations.

19:34.276 --> 19:37.176
Not big on tacos,
but thanks anyway.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.625
Have a good night.
Good night.

And thank you.

19:57.472 --> 19:58.956
Carter?

19:58.956 --> 20:00.302
Evelyn?

20:01.648 --> 20:02.718
What are you
doing here?

20:02.718 --> 20:03.857
Oh, no.

20:03.857 --> 20:05.859
"Oh, no" is right.

20:05.859 --> 20:07.240
The reservation
was in my calendar,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.000
and I thought
it shouldn't go to waste.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.140
I figured you'd long
forgotten about it.

20:11.140 --> 20:13.522
All those missed
Valentine's Days--

20:13.522 --> 20:14.799
Guess you needed
a new lady

20:14.799 --> 20:16.525
to suddenly
find the time.

20:16.525 --> 20:18.424
Uh...
Hi, I'm Fortune.

20:18.424 --> 20:21.047
Hi, I'm--
I'm sorry about this.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.117
I'm Evelyn.

20:22.117 --> 20:24.809
The ex-wife.

20:24.809 --> 20:26.432
Figured.

20:26.432 --> 20:28.468
Hey, guys.
How are you?

20:28.468 --> 20:30.436
I'm Marcus.
Nice to meet you.

20:30.436 --> 20:32.334
Well, now that we all
know each other,

20:32.334 --> 20:33.715
if you don't mind,
Fortune and I

20:33.715 --> 20:35.061
are gonna enjoy
this reservation

20:35.061 --> 20:36.304
that <i>I</i> prepaid for.

20:36.304 --> 20:38.133
As a gift to me.
Remember?

20:38.133 --> 20:39.686
Aren't you supposed to be
at home with our son?

20:39.686 --> 20:41.516
The one you want to take
2,000 miles away from me?

20:41.516 --> 20:43.000
Really, Carter?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.519
You want to do this
here and now?

20:48.039 --> 20:49.213
Hey.

20:49.213 --> 20:50.456
All done.

20:50.456 --> 20:52.043
- Thanks for waiting.
- Yeah.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.424
So, I-I was thinking,

20:53.424 --> 20:57.186
greasy drive-thru
sounds terrible.

20:57.186 --> 20:59.499
On Valentine's Day?
Yuck.

20:59.499 --> 21:01.777
I have a cauliflower pizza
in my freezer,

21:01.777 --> 21:06.265
so I thought maybe
I'll just do that for us.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.921
Yeah.

21:07.921 --> 21:09.854
You are the worst actress
in the world.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.548
You <i>do</i> care about
Valentine's Day, don't you?

21:13.548 --> 21:15.515
Don't you?

21:15.515 --> 21:19.692
Alright. Yes, okay?
I love it. I'm a woman.

21:19.692 --> 21:21.107
I'm French.
I'm a romantic.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.558
It's the one day of the year
designed for lovers.

21:23.558 --> 21:26.664
Then why didn't you
say anything?

21:26.664 --> 21:29.702
I was embarrassed.

21:29.702 --> 21:31.497
Hey.

21:33.947 --> 21:36.950
I <i>love</i> that you
love Valentine's Day,

21:36.950 --> 21:38.745
'cause guess what?

21:38.745 --> 21:41.230
I love Valentine's Day.

21:41.230 --> 21:45.890
Which is why I planned
something for us.

21:45.890 --> 21:49.515
I rented us
a house in Malibu,

21:49.515 --> 21:51.551
and there's a chef
there right now

21:51.551 --> 21:53.933
cooking us
a five-course dinner,

21:53.933 --> 21:56.176
and then we are gonna
walk on the beach.

21:56.176 --> 21:58.731
We're gonna get massages
while we listen to the ocean,

21:58.731 --> 22:01.527
and then we are
going to...

22:01.527 --> 22:05.254
sit by the fire
until the sun comes up.

22:05.254 --> 22:10.605
What happens after the fire
and before the sun?

22:10.605 --> 22:12.296
I'll leave that
up to you.

22:12.296 --> 22:14.988
♪ You sing the sweetest tune

22:14.988 --> 22:17.370
You can't have al pastor.
That's pork.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.648
Yes, I agree
pork is delicious,

22:19.648 --> 22:21.478
however,
your diabetes--

22:21.478 --> 22:25.171
Look, we'll eat chicken tacos
and binge-watch something, okay?

22:25.171 --> 22:26.828
Bye.

22:26.828 --> 22:32.592
Oh! So much has happened since
the last time I saw you, hmm?

22:32.592 --> 22:34.767
You took my advice
on the tacos

22:34.767 --> 22:36.458
and got you a hot date.

22:36.458 --> 22:37.735
Get it, girl.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.185
Date? Nah.

22:39.185 --> 22:41.083
That was my mom.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.983
She's getting older
and in denial about it.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.847
She's the reason
I moved down here.

22:45.847 --> 22:49.678
Wanna grab a drink
while we wait for our order?

22:49.678 --> 22:51.611
Sure.
Yeah? Come on.

22:53.855 --> 22:58.377
You and your ex
have some unresolved issues.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.689
I'm sorry you got caught
in the middle.

23:00.689 --> 23:04.452
Look, I get it.
We all have baggage.

23:04.452 --> 23:06.177
But you told me you were gonna
be honest with me,

23:06.177 --> 23:08.214
and then you go
and pull this?

23:08.214 --> 23:10.423
Bringing me to a dinner
meant for your ex?

23:10.423 --> 23:12.701
I know.

23:12.701 --> 23:15.117
And I don't know
what's wrong with me.

23:17.085 --> 23:20.157
I like you, Carter.

23:20.157 --> 23:21.917
I'm just not sure you're ready
to date right now.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.816
No, no, no.
Don't say that.

23:23.816 --> 23:25.645
I like you, too.

23:25.645 --> 23:27.578
We can salvage this night.
Where do you want to go?

23:27.578 --> 23:29.028
Anywhere.
Anywhere at all.

23:29.028 --> 23:31.064
I think it's best
if you just take me home.

23:34.378 --> 23:36.622
I had been with my girlfriend
for two years,

23:36.622 --> 23:40.211
but after I transferred
down here, we broke up.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.696
That sucks.

23:41.696 --> 23:44.353
I don't have any excuse
as to why I'm single.

23:44.353 --> 23:45.734
I date men and women,

23:45.734 --> 23:49.324
so you would think that my odds
would be much better.

23:49.324 --> 23:51.568
Ever date anyone
in law enforcement?

23:51.568 --> 23:52.983
Mnh-mnh.

23:52.983 --> 23:54.536
Why you ask?

23:54.536 --> 23:57.366
No one else understands
the demands of the job.

23:57.366 --> 23:58.678
We move different.

23:58.678 --> 24:00.922
Oh, I would much rather
date a civilian.

24:00.922 --> 24:03.614
I don't want to be in that
headspace when I get home.

24:03.614 --> 24:06.617
Well, then, get used to
being alone.

24:06.617 --> 24:08.895
Damn! Harsh.

24:08.895 --> 24:10.759
I'm just being real.

24:10.759 --> 24:15.212
I come from a cop family,
and everybody's still together.

24:15.212 --> 24:17.594
Just saying.

24:17.594 --> 24:19.596
Anyway, Mama's tacos
are getting cold.

24:19.596 --> 24:21.149
I better go.

24:21.149 --> 24:24.842
You're right, though.
Those were bomb. Later.

don't kick us out ♪

24:39.719 --> 24:42.135
I don't believe you.

24:42.135 --> 24:43.447
I have an offer.

24:44.793 --> 24:48.694
My daughter was beaten in prison
by the Mala Noche.

24:48.694 --> 24:50.419
Now they're threatening
to kill her

24:50.419 --> 24:52.767
if I don't turn over
my operations to them.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.700
So what's your offer?

24:54.700 --> 24:57.703
Transfer her to a
minimum-security federal prison

24:57.703 --> 24:59.532
Far away.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.776
Where my enemy
can't reach her.

25:01.776 --> 25:03.398
And what do I get
in return?

25:05.158 --> 25:06.574
Me.

25:12.649 --> 25:16.480
I do hope one of y'all made up
for my unsexy Valentine's night.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.516
Talk to me.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.036
Well, I FaceTimed with Atlas
all night.

25:21.036 --> 25:22.210
Props. Carter?

25:23.522 --> 25:24.488
B?

25:24.488 --> 25:26.076
Mine just ended
an hour ago.

25:26.076 --> 25:28.837
Whoo-hoo! Winner, winner!

25:28.837 --> 25:31.115
Well, you better get yourself
a double espresso, probie,

25:31.115 --> 25:33.048
because we've got
- a busy day ahead of us.
- Okay.

25:33.048 --> 25:36.189
Last night, I had a surprise
Valentine's date...

25:36.189 --> 25:37.466
with Tobias Kazan.

25:37.466 --> 25:38.882
Are you serious?

25:38.882 --> 25:40.608
Apparently, Mala Noche
has been threatening

25:40.608 --> 25:42.506
his daughter's
life in prison,

25:42.506 --> 25:44.715
and he wants us to transfer her
to a minimum-security facility

25:44.715 --> 25:46.821
for the rest of her sentence
for her safety.

25:46.821 --> 25:48.305
And in exchange,

25:48.305 --> 25:49.789
he'll help us make a case
against Mala Noche,

25:49.789 --> 25:52.033
and he'll give up
his meth-manufacturing lab

25:52.033 --> 25:53.310
here in LA.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.346
Tobias did not seem like
the type to surrender like that.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.141
I was skeptical
at first, too, Carter,

25:57.141 --> 25:58.936
but as a show
of good faith,

25:58.936 --> 26:01.560
he passed along some intel about
his drug suppliers in Greece.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.872
Interpol verified it,
and this morning,

26:03.872 --> 26:06.012
Hellenic Police
arrested 30 people.

26:06.012 --> 26:07.427
So this is real.

26:07.427 --> 26:09.740
Tobias has already set up
an in-person exchange.

26:09.740 --> 26:11.466
He's gonna hand over
all of his supply

26:11.466 --> 26:12.778
to Mala Noche's
leadership.

26:12.778 --> 26:14.607
So we can kill two birds
with one arrest.

26:14.607 --> 26:15.884
W-When's the exchange?

26:15.884 --> 26:17.472
That's the tricky part.

26:17.472 --> 26:19.612
Tobias says that he's only
gonna give up the time

26:19.612 --> 26:22.822
and the location if we grant him
immunity and move Aliz,

26:22.822 --> 26:25.100
so I'm gonna meet with
the AUSA to work out a deal.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.757
In the meantime, Laura, Brendon,

26:26.757 --> 26:28.552
liaise with
the Bureau of Prisons,

26:28.552 --> 26:30.416
and you make sure that Aliz
is under protective custody

26:30.416 --> 26:31.555
until she's transferred.

26:31.555 --> 26:32.936
And do it on the QT.

26:32.936 --> 26:34.869
We do not want Mala Noche
catching on.

26:34.869 --> 26:37.181
This is, uh, Naomi.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.459
Hey, Detective.

26:39.459 --> 26:41.703
You're on speaker
with Garza and Carter.

26:41.703 --> 26:43.774
<i>Hey. DHS picked up
our hit man,</i>

26:45.189 --> 26:46.777
about to board a flight
to Frankfurt.

26:46.777 --> 26:48.365
He's en route to my station
right now.

26:48.365 --> 26:49.746
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:49.746 --> 26:51.023
This is a federal case.
He should be on his w--

26:51.023 --> 26:52.472
<i>And this is
a courtesy call.</i>

26:52.472 --> 26:54.440
More than you gave me,
for the record.

26:55.648 --> 26:56.891
She hung up.

26:56.891 --> 26:58.168
Okay.

26:58.168 --> 26:59.410
Will you two please
go over there

26:59.410 --> 27:01.447
and see what you can get
out of Hans?

27:01.447 --> 27:04.070
Don't ever complain
about me again.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.106
Okay.

27:05.106 --> 27:07.004
Mnh-mnh.
Don't do it.

27:07.004 --> 27:09.973
How much were you paid,
Hans, to kill Chase?

27:09.973 --> 27:11.491
Which would be
the eighth murder

27:11.491 --> 27:13.355
across three continents
you're suspected of.

27:13.355 --> 27:14.840
But never charged with.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.496
That's the most
important part, yes?

27:16.496 --> 27:18.637
Hans, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.466
Your prints
were at the scene.

27:20.466 --> 27:23.642
Sure. 'Cause I'm a conflict
resolution specialist.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.333
You have
my mobile phone.

27:25.333 --> 27:28.439
So you'll discover I was hired
by a woman, Victoria Wagner,

27:28.439 --> 27:30.890
to find a man who played
a nefarious confidence game

27:30.890 --> 27:34.135
and tricked her
out of over $200,000.

27:34.135 --> 27:36.758
She paid you to find him
and to kill him.

27:36.758 --> 27:39.071
No, resolve conflict.

27:39.071 --> 27:40.831
But when I boarded
the ship,

27:40.831 --> 27:43.938
I found him sitting there,
speared like a fish.

27:43.938 --> 27:45.284
You expect us
to believe that?

27:45.284 --> 27:46.768
Hypothetically,

27:46.768 --> 27:49.978
were I this man
you're accusing me of being,

27:49.978 --> 27:53.464
I would never use a weapon
so crude and unreliable.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.019
It's a nice story.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.608
I did not
kill that man.

27:59.608 --> 28:01.852
Just found him.

28:01.852 --> 28:03.509
So what do we think?

28:03.509 --> 28:05.787
Hans is clearly a killer,
but is he <i>our</i> killer?

28:05.787 --> 28:07.513
Well, he's telling the truth
about one thing.

28:07.513 --> 28:11.517
He did get money from
Victoria Wagner-- 20,000 euros.

28:11.517 --> 28:15.590
And then she started sending him
all these texts in German.

28:15.590 --> 28:17.592
I'll reach out to the language
analysts to translate.

28:19.525 --> 28:22.528
There's a lot of clearly coded
text about payment.

28:22.528 --> 28:24.806
And then yesterday
at 11:47 a.m.,

28:24.806 --> 28:26.912
he messaged her,
"The job is done."

28:26.912 --> 28:28.189
Wait. You speak German?

28:28.189 --> 28:29.984
And Spanish.
Some Arabic.

28:29.984 --> 28:31.917
Show-off.

28:33.159 --> 28:35.196
Hans just got a text
from Victoria.

28:35.196 --> 28:38.337
"You lied.
Chase is not dead.

28:38.337 --> 28:40.373
He just contacted me
for more money."

28:40.373 --> 28:41.478
That's impossible.

28:41.478 --> 28:44.308
Unless someone has access
to his account

28:44.308 --> 28:45.758
and is posing as him.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.347
Chase must have
had a partner

28:48.347 --> 28:50.729
who's just become
desperate for cash.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.971
Damn.

28:51.971 --> 28:53.386
You want to do
<i>what</i> now?

28:53.386 --> 28:55.009
Catfish the catfisher.

28:55.009 --> 28:56.424
Our Casanova had a partner,

28:56.424 --> 28:58.081
and they contacted
one of his German victims,

28:58.081 --> 29:00.186
Victoria Wagner,
posing as him,

29:00.186 --> 29:01.809
trying to extort
another payment.

29:01.809 --> 29:04.121
Okay, so we want to draw
the partner out

29:04.121 --> 29:06.952
by pretending
to be Victoria online.

29:06.952 --> 29:08.747
Victoria will say
she can't transfer funds

29:08.747 --> 29:10.610
electronically the way
she normally does

29:10.610 --> 29:12.129
because her account's
tapped out.

29:12.129 --> 29:15.236
Yeah, but she can get a physical
check made out to cash

29:15.236 --> 29:18.135
by one of her business
associates in Los Angeles.

29:18.135 --> 29:19.447
And we'll set
that trap up

29:19.447 --> 29:21.276
in an office building
that we control.

29:21.276 --> 29:23.382
You smell
what I'm cooking?

29:23.382 --> 29:24.624
Do it.

29:27.489 --> 29:29.353
- We're in position.
- <i>Copy.</i>

29:29.353 --> 29:30.907
Position secured
in the lobby.

29:30.907 --> 29:33.254
When the partner picks up
the check from the receptionist,

29:33.254 --> 29:34.876
we got him. <i>Okay.</i>

29:34.876 --> 29:37.258
So it's obvious that the partner
is the killer, right?

29:37.258 --> 29:38.811
But why turn on Chase?

29:38.811 --> 29:40.640
My bet--
They were lovers.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.021
No.
No, no, no.
Hold on.

29:42.021 --> 29:45.542
The partner finds out that Chase
is gonna run off with Cora,

29:45.542 --> 29:47.647
has a fit,
kills in a jealous rage.

29:47.647 --> 29:48.648
Boom.

29:48.648 --> 29:50.133
50 bucks says
it was all business.

29:50.133 --> 29:52.756
Why do you hate love
so much?

29:52.756 --> 29:54.689
<i>Again with this? It's like
"The View" with you two.</i>

29:54.689 --> 29:55.690
Oh, hush.

29:55.690 --> 29:57.209
<i>One thing that's
become clear--</i>

29:57.209 --> 29:58.451
If Chase was the face
of the operation,

29:58.451 --> 29:59.556
then his partner
was the brains.

29:59.556 --> 30:01.075
I agree, Whoopi.

30:01.075 --> 30:02.524
<i>I take that
as a compliment.</i>

30:02.524 --> 30:04.319
<i>Now, Chase had a sophisticated
financial operation,</i>

30:04.319 --> 30:05.873
so his partner
had to be someone

30:05.873 --> 30:07.426
who knew how to open
shell corporations,

30:07.426 --> 30:08.876
<i>move cash internationally.</i>

30:08.876 --> 30:10.809
Chase's lawyer.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.672
That's a reach,
don't you think?

30:12.672 --> 30:15.296
Not really.
She's here.

30:15.296 --> 30:18.299
It's Audrey Evans, Carter,
and she's headed your way.

30:18.299 --> 30:20.404
As soon as she picks up
the envelope, we'll move in.

30:25.168 --> 30:26.652
Damn!
She made us.

30:31.312 --> 30:33.452
Audrey, don't.

30:33.452 --> 30:34.487
FBI!

30:34.487 --> 30:35.730
LAPD!

30:41.909 --> 30:46.189
Settle a bet. Did you kill Chase
for love or money?

30:46.189 --> 30:47.846
Lawyer.

30:49.882 --> 30:50.849
Damn!

30:55.129 --> 30:57.027
This looks
to be in order.

30:57.027 --> 30:59.133
Deal's not gonna
get any better, Tobias.

30:59.133 --> 31:02.136
You work your entire life
to build something,

31:02.136 --> 31:03.482
and then just like that,

31:03.482 --> 31:06.485
with some paper
and a borrowed pen,

31:06.485 --> 31:08.211
it all goes away.

31:08.211 --> 31:10.834
I'm not the audience
for your self-pity.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.180
You are a drug dealer,

31:12.180 --> 31:13.802
and everything
that you've built

31:13.802 --> 31:15.943
has been at the expense
of other people.

31:17.151 --> 31:18.566
That's karma.

31:18.566 --> 31:20.533
Hmm.

31:28.196 --> 31:29.680
At 8:00 p.m. tonight,

31:29.680 --> 31:31.199
several high-ranking members
of Mala Noche

31:31.199 --> 31:34.823
will meet at my cookhouse
on Soto and Valley.

31:34.823 --> 31:37.792
They're coming to take
all my product and supplies.

31:37.792 --> 31:39.449
Get comfortable

31:39.449 --> 31:40.450
because you're not
going anywhere

31:40.450 --> 31:42.141
until this is done.

31:43.522 --> 31:44.833
What's the sit-rep?

31:44.833 --> 31:46.905
We closed
the ClipMates Casanova case.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.182
Well, Naomi did.

31:48.182 --> 31:49.390
We let her
take the collar,

31:49.390 --> 31:50.978
'cause honestly,
she earned it.

31:50.978 --> 31:52.876
Should we fold in
- on Tobias?
- Yeah.

31:52.876 --> 31:54.464
I need you to get
Aliz's statement

31:54.464 --> 31:56.776
before marshals transfer her
to her new prison, okay?

31:56.776 --> 31:58.675
Simone, you got her
to open up the last time,

31:58.675 --> 31:59.814
so do your thing.

31:59.814 --> 32:01.264
- Don't I always?
- Yeah.

32:01.264 --> 32:02.437
Laura, Brendon, and I
are going with SWAT

32:02.437 --> 32:03.714
to Tobias's cookhouse.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.406
Got you.

32:05.406 --> 32:07.615
They said if my dad
doesn't hand over his business

32:07.615 --> 32:08.927
by tomorrow...

32:10.204 --> 32:11.860
...they'll cut
my throat.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.724
Thank you, Aliz.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.657
A marshal will be here soon
to transfer you.

32:17.625 --> 32:20.559
I was surprised you were
taking my statement.

32:20.559 --> 32:23.700
You put me away,
and now you're helping me out.

32:23.700 --> 32:24.701
Thank you.

32:24.701 --> 32:26.392
Thank your father.

32:26.392 --> 32:27.773
Wait.

32:27.773 --> 32:29.326
I-I thought you were
just being kind.

32:29.326 --> 32:32.674
My-- My father actually
gave up his drug operation?

32:32.674 --> 32:33.675
Yeah.

32:33.675 --> 32:34.711
He made a deal with Garza.

32:34.711 --> 32:36.195
Garza?

32:36.195 --> 32:37.921
No, my-- my dad
hates that guy.

32:37.921 --> 32:41.269
Well, maybe he loves you
more than he hates him.

32:41.269 --> 32:44.100
No, he doesn't.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.447
You think my dad
actually cares about me?

32:46.447 --> 32:50.244
No. The only thing
that he loves is his business.

32:50.244 --> 32:52.418
He would never
give that up.

32:52.418 --> 32:54.110
Especially to your boss.

33:02.290 --> 33:04.775
Surveillance feed
is up and running.

33:08.158 --> 33:10.160
Did you get
- Aliz's statement?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

33:10.160 --> 33:12.266
But are you sure this deal
is on the up and up?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.164
Why do you ask?

33:14.164 --> 33:15.821
Because based on
what Aliz just said,

33:15.821 --> 33:19.066
Tobias as the dutiful father
is an act.

33:19.066 --> 33:20.791
Meet's supposed to be
at 8:00.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.414
They're already
12 minutes late.

33:22.414 --> 33:23.967
Maybe Mala Noche
got cold feet.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.451
Or Tobias
gave you bad intel

33:25.451 --> 33:27.695
to lure you down
to an environment he controls,

33:27.695 --> 33:29.697
<i>setting up both the FBI
and Mala Noche.</i>

33:29.697 --> 33:31.664
<i>Boss, what better way</i>

33:31.664 --> 33:34.150
to get rid of
all your enemies

33:34.150 --> 33:36.462
than to have them there
at the same time?

33:36.462 --> 33:38.292
Matt, this is
a meth lab.

33:38.292 --> 33:39.948
With the amount
of volatile chemicals in there,

33:39.948 --> 33:42.020
it would only take one
well-placed explosive

33:42.020 --> 33:45.057
for this whole block to go boom
and a lot of people die.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.266
Would he sacrifice
his own men like that?

33:47.266 --> 33:48.923
Risk blowing the deal
that he cut?

33:48.923 --> 33:51.857
Tobias Kazan?
One hundred percent.

33:51.857 --> 33:53.583
Let's go check it out.

34:17.883 --> 34:19.643
We have two armed bogeys,
south wall.

34:19.643 --> 34:21.645
Copy that.
Keep eyes on them.

34:37.489 --> 34:38.835
It's getting
a little crowded in here.

34:38.835 --> 34:40.147
We need to step this up.

34:40.147 --> 34:42.045
Almost to the tanks.

34:53.574 --> 34:55.162
Matt, we got a problem.

34:55.162 --> 34:56.922
Carter was right.
This is a trap.

34:56.922 --> 34:58.993
Tobias wired C4
onto one of the tanks.

34:58.993 --> 35:02.307
And if it goes off, this whole
block becomes a crater.

35:02.307 --> 35:04.412
Mala Noche just arrived.

35:04.412 --> 35:06.483
We need to disarm that bomb
right away.

35:11.971 --> 35:12.938
Bogeys on the move.

35:12.938 --> 35:14.215
<i>They're all in the one spot.</i>

35:31.198 --> 35:32.958
Bomb disarmed.

35:32.958 --> 35:34.546
SWAT team, move in.
Go, go.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.486
FBI!
Hands up right now!

35:43.486 --> 35:45.246
No, no, no, no, no.
Hands up. Let's go.

35:45.246 --> 35:48.111
Show me your hands.
Hands up, everyone.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.150
Boss, you okay?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.185
- Yeah. You good?
- Yeah.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.153
Laura, you good?
Yeah.

36:00.813 --> 36:02.815
You surprised
to see me alive?

36:02.815 --> 36:03.816
Did something go wrong?

36:03.816 --> 36:05.197
Cut the crap, Tobias.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.268
You set us up,
and you set up Mala Noche.

36:07.268 --> 36:09.857
You had that place rigged
to explode.

36:09.857 --> 36:11.721
Why on earth
would I do that?

36:11.721 --> 36:14.655
To send a message to anyone who
might be coming after you again.

36:14.655 --> 36:17.347
Your daughter's prison transfer
was dependent on this deal,

36:17.347 --> 36:19.280
and I'm pulling it.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.317
Threatening
my daughter's safety?

36:21.317 --> 36:23.802
Oh, you must
be desperate, Garza.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.838
But we both know
you're too much of a do-gooder

36:25.838 --> 36:28.358
to send her back
into that lion's den.

36:30.878 --> 36:33.743
Are you willing to risk
your daughter's life for this?

36:34.847 --> 36:37.367
To use her
like some kind of pawn?

36:39.749 --> 36:43.615
Aliz--
she's a big girl.

36:43.615 --> 36:46.894
She made her choices.
Now she's on her own.

36:46.894 --> 36:49.724
And the deal I signed
granted me immunity

36:49.724 --> 36:53.452
from prosecution regarding
the LA meth lab.

36:53.452 --> 36:54.764
So...

36:56.869 --> 36:58.492
...unless you can prove

36:58.492 --> 37:01.633
I have something to do
with that supposed bomb...

37:02.772 --> 37:04.394
...may I go now?

37:09.986 --> 37:11.643
Why am I here?

37:11.643 --> 37:13.023
Tobias says he gave up
his entire operation.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.508
But I know that
there's got to be more,

37:14.508 --> 37:17.269
and we believe
that you know all about it.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.029
Turn state's evidence.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.583
We can put him away
for good.

37:20.583 --> 37:22.895
Forget it.

37:22.895 --> 37:24.587
We can keep you safe.

37:24.587 --> 37:26.347
You can start a new life.

37:26.347 --> 37:27.797
Find new love.

37:29.557 --> 37:34.182
Look, my husband
is not a good man.

37:34.182 --> 37:36.737
But my daughter needs
her father in her life.

37:36.737 --> 37:38.773
I'm not going to destroy
what's left of our family.

37:38.773 --> 37:40.844
Well, it's a shame

37:40.844 --> 37:44.020
that your husband
doesn't feel the same way.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.366
<i>Are you willing to risk</i>

37:45.366 --> 37:47.437
<i>your daughter's life
for this?</i>

37:47.437 --> 37:50.198
<i>To use her like
some kind of pawn?</i>

37:52.580 --> 37:55.273
<i>Aliz--
she's a big girl.</i>

37:56.343 --> 37:58.621
<i>She made her choices.
Now she's on her own.</i>

37:59.656 --> 38:03.488
You are the only one
who cares about Aliz.

38:04.696 --> 38:06.284
It would seem
that you're right.

38:08.147 --> 38:09.563
Which is why
the last place I should be

38:09.563 --> 38:11.392
is in witness protection--

38:11.392 --> 38:12.738
unable to look out for her,

38:12.738 --> 38:14.395
to use his resources
to protect her.

38:14.395 --> 38:15.776
So you're gonna stay
with him,

38:15.776 --> 38:18.744
even though he is
a complete monster?

38:20.815 --> 38:21.920
I have to.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.474
For my daughter.

38:33.656 --> 38:35.347
Delivery.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.970
Oh, that's beautiful.
Who's it for?

38:39.144 --> 38:40.179
You.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.251
You trying to buy
my forgiveness?

38:43.251 --> 38:44.908
I am so sorry
about last night.

38:44.908 --> 38:46.116
You were right...

38:46.116 --> 38:47.980
about everything,
except one.

38:47.980 --> 38:49.361
I am ready to date.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.121
Sure about that?
Absolutely.

38:51.121 --> 38:52.813
I promise you,
no more lies.

38:52.813 --> 38:54.573
No more dodging, hiding,
no more being afraid

38:54.573 --> 38:56.368
that my truth is too much
for you to handle.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.784
Just radical transparency.

38:58.784 --> 39:00.338
That's a serious commitment.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.649
I'm a serious dude.

39:01.649 --> 39:02.823
I can prove it to you.

39:02.823 --> 39:04.238
Here are
some straight-up truths

39:04.238 --> 39:06.067
that I've never mentioned
to anyone before.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.347
In the fifth grade,
we had "share day."

39:09.347 --> 39:12.039
But I thought the teacher
meant Cher, the singer/actress.

39:12.039 --> 39:14.697
So I dressed up
in a big wig and jumpsuit.

39:14.697 --> 39:16.008
No, you did not.

39:16.008 --> 39:18.390
Yes, I did.
And I looked fly as hell.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.495
Here's another truth--

39:19.495 --> 39:20.841
"Breakin' 2:
Electric Boogaloo"

39:20.841 --> 39:22.187
is my all-time
favorite movie.

39:22.187 --> 39:23.706
And that's for real.

39:23.706 --> 39:25.466
I tear up during
the final dance number

39:25.466 --> 39:26.709
every time.

39:26.709 --> 39:28.055
Sorry not sorry.

39:28.055 --> 39:29.746
Number three--Okay, stop now,

39:29.746 --> 39:31.955
or I'll regret
what I'm about to say.

39:38.065 --> 39:39.549
I am willing to give

39:39.549 --> 39:43.311
this radically transparent
truth-teller another chance.

and wanted to share.

40:58.076 --> 40:59.698
What's up?

Garza invoked the power
of the federal government

here and abroad to seize
all of Aubrey Evans's assets.

41:06.567 --> 41:09.536
