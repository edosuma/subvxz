Come on, Chloe.

Dad, we come here all the time

We haven't done anything.

Baseball, summer camp,

- Dad, you said

06:33.625 --> 06:35.394
it was gonna be fun.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.129
- Well, Dad lied.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.365
- I didn't lie, Chloe.

- He lied.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.132
Lied like a rug.

06:40.165 --> 06:41.334
it's going to be fun...

- This--

06:41.367 --> 06:43.269
- And it never is.

06:45.704 --> 06:47.807
that they're bored when

you're losing your touch.

07:02.521 --> 07:05.791
Like, your summer activities

07:02.521 --> 07:05.791

07:05.824 --> 07:08.360
losing my touch at all.

07:08.394 --> 07:12.649
As a matter of fact,

07:08.394 --> 07:12.649
I'm going to take everyone

07:12.980 --> 07:14.600
in this family to Florida

07:12.980 --> 07:14.600
for a few weeks.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.704
- Yes, Florida.

- Yay!

07:17.737 --> 07:19.172
- No way?

07:19.204 --> 07:20.874
- I like this.

07:19.204 --> 07:20.874
- Yes, okay.

07:20.906 --> 07:22.307
Now, who wants to fly a kite?

07:22.341 --> 07:23.543
- Me.

You've got, like,

07:56.242 --> 07:58.545
this aura about children.

07:58.577 --> 08:00.480
- It's called being salty.

08:00.512 --> 08:02.314
- Why?

08:00.512 --> 08:02.314
- She's mad

08:02.348 --> 08:04.817
because I told the kids

08:02.348 --> 08:04.817
about the Florida trip.

08:04.850 --> 08:08.420
- No, your dad made the kids

08:08.454 --> 08:10.490
to go to Florida

08:17.300 --> 08:19.132
that does track.

You do the planning.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.805
to do the final deposit

08:26.839 --> 08:28.341

08:28.375 --> 08:31.769

That's not a problem.

it wasn't your womb,

08:51.463 --> 08:53.732
it was her womb.

It's pastel season.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.908
Get your stuff.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.945
- It was all folded neatly.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.279
- Go to your room,

11:51.977 --> 11:54.279
pack your stuff.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.414
I don't care

11:54.313 --> 11:55.414
if you want to take

11:55.447 --> 11:57.169
one pair of underwear

11:55.447 --> 11:57.169
for nine days.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.751
I don't care.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.751
- Dad, I can't find my snorkle.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.886
- Then get you a big straw.

12:00.919 --> 12:03.123
Go. Go get your stuff.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.625
I mean,

12:03.155 --> 12:05.625
this is absolutely exhausting.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.940
All of the moving parts

12:05.658 --> 12:08.940
that go along

12:08.128 --> 12:10.397
with trying to load everyone up

12:08.128 --> 12:10.397
and go somewhere.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.667
- What happened to,

12:10.429 --> 12:13.667
"Well, how hard can it be?"

12:13.700 --> 12:16.168
- You know what, Savannah?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.168
Rather than you cast judgment,

12:16.201 --> 12:18.710
why don't you just volunteer

12:16.201 --> 12:18.710
to help?

12:18.104 --> 12:19.905
- Okay, so let me see

12:18.104 --> 12:19.905
where you're at.

12:19.938 --> 12:21.807
Have you made

12:19.938 --> 12:21.807
dinner reservations?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.942
- Not yet.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.942
- Oh, my gosh.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.245
What about activities?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.379
- It's on the list.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.216
- You do realize that this is

12:27.413 --> 12:30.216
the busiest season of the year.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.352
Did you at least put the final

12:30.250 --> 12:33.352
deposit down on the house?

12:33.385 --> 12:34.620
- You act like

12:33.385 --> 12:34.620
I don't do anything.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.889
It's on the list.

12:36.121 --> 12:37.890
- Oh, dear God.

12:36.121 --> 12:37.890
You know--you want to know

12:37.923 --> 12:39.525
what would make

12:37.923 --> 12:39.525
all your problems go away?

12:39.558 --> 12:40.894
- What, Savannah?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.296
- Just pass me

12:40.927 --> 12:43.296
your credit card.

12:43.328 --> 12:44.663
- Okay, I'm going to give you

12:43.328 --> 12:44.663
my credit card,

12:44.697 --> 12:46.432
but you cannot tell

12:44.697 --> 12:46.432
your mom about it.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.767
- All right, that's fine.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.602
You know I'm always down

12:47.801 --> 12:50.602
to take a little hush money.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.672
- Hush.

12:52.706 --> 12:55.799
- You know, Savannah,

12:52.706 --> 12:55.799
I do appreciate your help.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.277
- No, Todd, I appreciate you,

13:00.245 --> 13:06.318
<i>[mellow classical music]</i>

13:06.820 --> 13:08.221

13:08.254 --> 13:09.389
This might become

13:08.254 --> 13:09.389
my new hang out.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.490
- It is so cute.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.759
- Oh, my gosh,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.759
they have skee ball.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.894
This is a great little spot.

13:14.927 --> 13:15.894
- You know what

13:14.927 --> 13:15.894
I'm excited about?

13:15.928 --> 13:17.629
- What?

13:17.629 --> 13:18.431
- I'm excited that you're

13:17.629 --> 13:18.431
in a good mood

13:18.465 --> 13:20.265
because it's a completely

13:18.465 --> 13:20.265
different story at the house.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.235
I mean, Daddy is struggling

13:20.299 --> 13:23.235
with that packing.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.371
He told the kids to just

13:23.269 --> 13:25.371
figure it out themselves.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.173
- I knew he wouldn't be able

13:25.404 --> 13:27.173
to handle it,

13:27.206 --> 13:30.376
and it serves him right

13:27.206 --> 13:30.376
for being so cocky.

13:30.409 --> 13:32.912
- I mean, Mama, he hasn't even

13:30.409 --> 13:32.912
put down, like,

13:32.946 --> 13:35.715
the final deposit

13:32.946 --> 13:35.715
for a place to stay.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.750
We're packing and we don't even

13:35.749 --> 13:37.750
have a place to lay our head.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.451
- Oh, yeah, we got a place

13:37.783 --> 13:39.451
to lay our head

13:39.485 --> 13:41.321
'cause I knew

13:39.485 --> 13:41.321
he'd forget that.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.322
I've already paid it,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.322
got the confirmation,

13:43.355 --> 13:44.890
and we are ready to go.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.692
- So basically you're

13:44.923 --> 13:46.692
planning this trip?

13:46.725 --> 13:49.428
- Savannah, how long have

13:46.725 --> 13:49.428
I been married to your father?

13:49.461 --> 13:51.297
- I don't know.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.297
Like, too long.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.767
- Okay. Well, that means

13:51.331 --> 13:53.767
I know who he is

13:53.799 --> 13:55.835
and what he's capable of doing.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.171
And putting together a trip?

13:58.203 --> 14:00.706
No, I'm not leaving that

13:58.203 --> 14:00.706
to his hands.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.808
Listen, I just want

14:00.740 --> 14:02.808
to make him sweat a little bit.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.576
- Oh, trust me,

14:02.841 --> 14:04.576
he's sweating, all right.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.470
- Good, because

14:04.610 --> 14:07.470
he hasn't apologized yet,

14:07.470 --> 14:08.748
so this is a little payback.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.783
- Well, listen,

14:08.782 --> 14:10.783
he gave me his card

14:10.817 --> 14:12.686
to, like,

14:10.817 --> 14:12.686
put the final deposit in.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.855
- Really?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.389
We can have some fun with that.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.826
- You are speaking

14:17.423 --> 14:19.826
my love language.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.178
- How about this, buddy?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.178
We made it to Florida.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.809
- We did,

14:39.211 --> 14:41.809
and out of all the things

14:41.809 --> 14:42.481
that I could be doing,

14:42.514 --> 14:45.684
I'm out here

14:42.514 --> 14:45.684
to gamble on a hermit crab.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.153
- Chase, you gotta get

14:45.719 --> 14:47.153
your head

14:47.187 --> 14:48.822
in the game so let's go.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.591
- I understand that, Nanny,

14:48.855 --> 14:51.591
but, like, why crabs

14:51.624 --> 14:53.960
when there's so many other

14:51.624 --> 14:53.960
things we could gamble on?

14:53.993 --> 14:56.663
- Chase, I don't think you're

14:53.993 --> 14:56.663
ready for the big league yet,

14:56.696 --> 15:01.600
so we have to start with

14:56.696 --> 15:01.600
the small and work on up.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.436
- All right, teach me

15:01.634 --> 15:03.436
how we're going to do this.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.538
- Okay. Let's name these crabs.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.740
- Okay.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.743
- This is Blanche, Sophia,

15:09.775 --> 15:11.878
and Rose, and Dorothy.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.446
- Where did the names

15:11.910 --> 15:13.446
come from?

15:13.480 --> 15:17.317
- "The Golden Girls,"

15:13.480 --> 15:17.317
obviously.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.784
- All right, Nanny,

15:17.350 --> 15:18.784
who are we betting on?

15:18.817 --> 15:20.552
- We're gonna bet on Blanche.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.559
- But you think that one

15:20.586 --> 15:23.559
is faster than that one?

15:23.559 --> 15:25.424
- Certainly.

15:23.559 --> 15:25.424
He has thin shells.

15:25.457 --> 15:26.826
- Well, you're the one

15:25.457 --> 15:26.826
that's been winning,

15:26.860 --> 15:28.661
so we're gonna go

15:26.860 --> 15:28.661
with whatever you say.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.797
- All righty. Who's ready

15:28.695 --> 15:30.797

Everybody, pick your racers.

17:57.777 --> 18:01.140
on this vacation.

18:01.470 --> 18:03.849
- Oh, thank you.

18:01.470 --> 18:03.849
- I know, I'm so proud of you.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.617
- Listen, y'all don't have

18:03.883 --> 18:05.617
to keep doing all that.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.220
- I think Mom is impressed.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.255
- I mean, to do all this,

18:09.288 --> 18:13.259
plus all the extras,

18:09.288 --> 18:13.259
I mean, that's something.

18:13.589 --> 18:14.794
- Actually--

18:13.589 --> 18:14.794
- Yeah, remember?

18:14.827 --> 18:16.563
Like, the couple's massage

18:14.827 --> 18:16.563
you requested

18:16.596 --> 18:20.660
that I book for you two,

18:16.596 --> 18:20.660
the private chef.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.500
- You--

18:21.534 --> 18:22.935
- Wasn't that so sweet of him

18:21.534 --> 18:22.935
to do for all of us?

18:23.359 --> 18:25.105
- That was so sweet.

18:23.359 --> 18:25.105
- Yeah.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.207
- Because it's actually

18:25.137 --> 18:27.207
going to be a vacation for me.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.576
- It's--it was nothing.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.576
I mean, you know.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.611
- Mm-hmm.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.611
- Oh.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.712
I forgot--the yacht.

18:33.747 --> 18:34.713
- Yacht?

18:34.748 --> 18:36.715
- Yeah, yacht.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.951
I love a yacht.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.951
And, like, a mega yacht?

18:39.519 --> 18:40.386
- Oh.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.386
- [sighs]

18:40.420 --> 18:42.955
Hired it for 12 hours.

18:43.559 --> 18:45.290
- Don't the captain

18:43.559 --> 18:45.290
have to have a break?

<i>* *</i>

18:53.532 --> 18:54.933
- [laughs]

18:54.968 --> 18:56.536
- Y'all are messing with me.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.872
- I mean, this is just

18:56.568 --> 18:58.872
a little payback

18:58.904 --> 19:00.740
for you trying to take

18:58.904 --> 19:00.740
all the thunder.

19:00.773 --> 19:01.807
- So you didn't really charge

19:01.840 --> 19:03.308
all that stuff

19:01.840 --> 19:03.308
on my card, right?

19:03.343 --> 19:05.450
- We didn't get a mega yacht.

19:05.779 --> 19:06.578
- But you still rented a yacht.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.881
- Well, yeah.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.819
You know, all this

19:07.913 --> 19:09.819
could have been avoided

19:09.115 --> 19:10.916
if you would've

19:09.115 --> 19:10.916
just apologized.

19:11.170 --> 19:14.200
- Okay, well,

19:11.170 --> 19:14.200
I guess I deserve that.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.555
I mean, listen,

19:15.587 --> 19:19.726
I know that I did take credit

19:15.587 --> 19:19.726
for the vacation and I'm sorry.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.796
- Yeah, you did.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.796
- I get it and I apologize.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.299
- Oh, well, thank you.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.298
And we're gonna have

19:24.640 --> 19:25.298
a great time.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.665
- We're gonna have

19:25.330 --> 19:26.665
a great time.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.134
- I mean, we're in Florida,

19:26.700 --> 19:29.134
got a beautiful house.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.470
- Yes.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.470
- We got a pool.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.105
- And you get the bunk bed

19:30.502 --> 19:33.105
for being the snitch.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.342
- [laughs]

19:33.138 --> 19:35.342
- Hey, suckers get licked.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.355

19:46.486 --> 19:48.355
Here you go.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.589

19:50.623 --> 19:53.226
- Come on, Gray.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.361
- Really?

19:53.259 --> 19:54.361
[laughter]

19:54.394 --> 19:55.461
- Come on, Coco.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.596
- One, two, three, go.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.401
- Enjoy life, girl.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.401
There you go.

20:01.433 --> 20:05.171
- Chase, why don't we make this

20:01.433 --> 20:05.171
pool party really interesting?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.405
- Here we go.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.941
- Why don't we take that money

20:06.439 --> 20:07.941
that you won

20:07.973 --> 20:09.541
at the hermit crab race

20:09.576 --> 20:12.578
and let's us just get ourselves

20:09.576 --> 20:12.578
a good card game

20:12.612 --> 20:14.146
and let's winner take all.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.781
- Absolutely not.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.781
- Why?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.916
- I just got back

20:15.815 --> 20:17.916
to winning, Nanny.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.153
Why would I go and test

20:17.951 --> 20:20.153
my luck and lose?

20:20.185 --> 20:22.689
- I'm the one who showed you

20:20.185 --> 20:22.689
how to win with what you got.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.990
- Nanny, I need you

20:22.721 --> 20:24.990
to understand something, okay?

20:25.250 --> 20:28.627
The moment I stopped

20:25.250 --> 20:28.627
listening to you,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.296
I started to win.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.699
- Well, it was worth a try.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.670
- This is so pretty out here.

20:36.702 --> 20:38.380
- I know.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.400
- Look at you. What you got?

20:40.730 --> 20:42.875
- Darling, listen, I just want

20:40.730 --> 20:42.875
to thank you for the vacation.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.109
So I just wanted to give you

20:42.909 --> 20:45.109
some flowers and let you know

20:45.450 --> 20:47.413
that this is going

20:45.450 --> 20:47.413
to be an amazing trip.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.351
we have no children...

20:51.384 --> 20:52.384
- Praise Jesus.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.186
- And we're getting away

20:52.419 --> 20:54.186
from them.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.721
- Well, I love that.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.721
Muah.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.490
- Julie, you know that I don't

20:55.755 --> 20:57.490
like to admit when I'm wrong,

20:57.523 --> 20:59.325
but I certainly should not

20:57.523 --> 20:59.325
have been dismissive

20:59.358 --> 21:00.727
about all the stuff

20:59.358 --> 21:00.727
that you do.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.394
I mean, you actually

21:00.759 --> 21:02.394
deserve a medal.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.131
And as far as charging my card,

21:02.429 --> 21:05.131
you earned it.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.566
I mean, except for the yacht

21:05.164 --> 21:06.566
because you know,

21:06.598 --> 21:10.170
we're not Jay-Z and Beyoncé...

21:06.598 --> 21:10.170
yet.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.637
- Kids, y'all having

21:10.202 --> 21:11.637
a good time?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.972
all: Yeah!

21:11.671 --> 21:13.972
- 100%.

21:14.740 --> 21:15.942
And didn't you have

21:14.740 --> 21:15.942
more food coming?

21:15.974 --> 21:18.779
- Yeah, the chef should be

21:15.974 --> 21:18.779
coming out any second.

21:18.779 --> 21:19.346
- Kids, I want to point out

21:19.378 --> 21:21.647
it's your mother

21:19.378 --> 21:21.647
that's the fun parent.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.482
- Oh, no, listen, it's a team.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.751
- I don't think anybody

21:23.516 --> 21:25.751
has ever accused

21:25.785 --> 21:27.787
either one of y'all

21:25.785 --> 21:27.787
of being fun.

- [laughs]
