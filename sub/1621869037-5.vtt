WEBVTT

00:20.562 --> 00:21.479
[sighs]

00:27.819 --> 00:29.029
Boy, you got old.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.782
Look who's talking.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.285
[inhales deeply] How're you feeling?

00:36.619 --> 00:40.373
I know you mean well,
but that is a stupid question.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.250
-[laughs]
-Where's Mindy?

00:42.333 --> 00:45.045
Uh, she and Martin went
to get something to eat.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.297
And you stayed to keep an eye on me?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.841
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.301
[chuckles]

00:55.346 --> 00:59.934
So, how long were you planning
on keeping your condition a secret?

01:00.518 --> 01:01.436
What condition?

01:03.688 --> 01:06.524
I don't know. I just wanted
to spend time with my daughter

01:06.608 --> 01:08.318
without her having to worry about me.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.320
Roz, she's worried.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.279
Yeah.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.991
But you're not alone.
We're gonna get you through this.

01:15.075 --> 01:21.081
Yeah. Well, I appreciate your concern,
but this does not end well.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.583
You don't know that.
I mean, there… there's, uh, chemo--

01:23.666 --> 01:24.876
-Did it.
-Bone marrow--

01:24.959 --> 01:27.170
-Did it.
-All kinds of holistic stuff--

01:27.253 --> 01:29.089
Bunch of bullshit. And did it.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.674
[exhales] Well, I'm sure
there's things that you didn't do.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.384
-Sandy…
-[Sandy] Sorry.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.387
I forgot my ex-wife
is the smartest person in the world.

01:36.471 --> 01:41.392
Is that why all your other ex-wives
are dumber than a bag of rocks?

01:41.476 --> 01:43.770
-Ooh. That's a low blow.
-[Roz] Mmm.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.439
But maybe. Yeah.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.025
Assuming that you're right about this,
what's your plan?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.236
Well, it's pretty simple, really.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.865
After a while, I go into assisted living
then hospice.

01:55.949 --> 02:01.204
And then I get to find out if helping
sick people in third-world countries

02:01.287 --> 02:03.373
gets me a meet and greet with Jesus.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.669
You are a piece of work.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.921
I remember when you thought
I was a piece of ass.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.798
I always said that as a compliment.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.591
And I took it as one.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.509
[Sandy laughs]

02:15.718 --> 02:18.304
So, listen, um,
your plans are no good.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.641
There's not gonna be an assisted living
or a hospice.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.935
You stay with me and Mindy.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.271
If we need help, we'll bring somebody in.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.064
That's not gonna work.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.900
It's too hard. Too exhausting.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.861
Oh, stop being so smart.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.028
Too expensive.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.615
Aha! You forgot
your daughter is Mindy Warbucks.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.076
Besides, every dollar we spend on you

02:40.160 --> 02:43.329
is a dollar not spent on hair plugs

02:43.413 --> 02:45.331
for Estelle Schneider's little boy.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.584
You aren't serious.

02:47.667 --> 02:51.880
He has expressed a desire
to bring back the, uh… the pompadour.

02:51.963 --> 02:52.964
[laughs]

02:53.047 --> 02:55.425
"Kookie, lend me your comb."

02:55.508 --> 02:56.551
[laughs]

02:56.634 --> 02:58.219
All right. So, why?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.054
[Sandy] Why what?

03:00.972 --> 03:03.266
Why, after all these years of…

03:05.476 --> 03:06.936
after all these years…

03:07.562 --> 03:08.396
[groans softly]

03:09.147 --> 03:11.983
Don't overthink it. I… I just, uh, do.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.111
Well, are you a recovering alcoholic?

03:15.195 --> 03:18.198
-You making amends?
-I said, don't overthink it.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.659
[Martin] I'm curious.
Were you born cesarean or vaginal?

03:21.743 --> 03:22.911
Cover me.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.079
What? Why?

03:25.580 --> 03:28.374
I'm gonna guess vaginal,
'cause of how close you are with your mom.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.709
I was cesarean.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.128
My mother couldn't be bothered to push.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.589
-[Mindy] Hey.
-Shh.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.841
-She okay?
-[mouthing]

03:45.308 --> 03:48.645
[sniffs] Do you know, to this day,
I eat Jell-O, I think of Bill Cosby?

03:48.728 --> 03:50.980
I feel guilty now
'cause I… I still enjoy it.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.441
'Cause the-- Hmm.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.070
[theme music playing]

04:01.324 --> 04:03.284
-[laughing]
-And then the sparks fly…

04:03.368 --> 04:05.411
[students chattering indistinctly]

04:05.495 --> 04:07.288
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.206
[Lane laughs]

04:08.289 --> 04:11.125
[Theresa] I had a retainer, but I lost it.
They're very expensive.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.253
[groans]

04:17.715 --> 04:18.549
No.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.552
-This isn't about money.
-We're here to help mankind.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.638
Oh, will you just stop it with that shit?

04:23.721 --> 04:25.682
-[Robbie] It's true.
-I don't care. Just stop it!

04:28.685 --> 04:29.936
[grunts] Make it fast.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.274
Okay, so, uh, we just wanted to thank you
for honoring Dad's…

04:34.357 --> 04:35.191
[Sandy] Faster.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.402
…wishes, and we wanna do that too.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.362
-So what we're proposing--
-Time's up.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.782
Is to create a philanthropic foundation
that gives grandpa's money to good causes,

04:42.865 --> 04:44.951
with a special focus
on healthcare and education.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.870
-[sighs]
-[Phoebe] Thoughts?

04:48.454 --> 04:51.624
-Questions?
-Yeah. What's the catch?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.209
There's no catch.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.795
We just got to talking
about what would make grandpa happy,

04:55.878 --> 04:56.879
and we came up with this.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.507
The Norman Newlander Family Foundation.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.634
Our mission statement is
to help down-stats--

05:01.718 --> 05:02.844
Down-stats?

05:02.927 --> 05:03.886
Poor people.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.556
[splutters] Is to help poor people

05:06.639 --> 05:09.142
get access to free healthcare
and pursue their educational goals.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.601
With scholarships.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.770
That is what he wanted.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.688
[Phoebe] Right?

05:14.689 --> 05:17.817
So, uh, what's in it for you?

05:18.651 --> 05:23.031
Well, giving away all this money
would be our full-time job.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.491
We would just need
some kind of compensation.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.868
To cover expenses and such.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.286
Sure. Yeah.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.831
So?

05:32.957 --> 05:35.168
-So, what?
-So, give me a number.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.919
Well, before we do that,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.630
I think it's important to factor in
what we bring to the job.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.008
My training as a Scientology registrar
is particularly--

05:42.091 --> 05:43.593
What's the number?

05:43.676 --> 05:46.054
-A million dollars a year.
-Each.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.570
-Half a million?
-Get out of here.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.699
-"Scientology registrar," really?
-[door closes]

06:06.783 --> 06:08.743
What's your résumé say, "dope fiend"?

06:08.826 --> 06:10.203
Hey, I'm in recovery.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.581
-Hey, I'm an operating thetan.
-You're an operating asshole.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.624
[both shivering]

06:14.707 --> 06:18.086
[Jude] Winning that ticket, Rose, was
the best thing that ever happened to me,

06:18.169 --> 06:22.006
because it brought me to you.
And for that, I am… I'm thankful.

06:22.090 --> 06:26.386
I'm thankful, Rose,
so you… you… you must do me this honor.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.263
-Promise me that you'll survive.
-[gasping]

06:29.347 --> 06:33.017
No matter what happens.
No matter how hopeless.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.268
Promise me.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.021
And never let go of that promise, Rose.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.024
Never let go.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.318
[whimpering] I'll never let go.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.322
I will never let go.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.452
[crying softly]

06:54.580 --> 06:56.165
[Breana crying softly]

07:02.422 --> 07:06.134
Jack, there's… there's a boat.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.051
[gasping]

07:07.593 --> 07:09.345
There's a boat, Ja… Jack.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.558
Come back.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.186
Come back! [sobs]

07:17.895 --> 07:19.063
I'll never let go.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.189
[whimpering]

07:24.110 --> 07:25.695
[whistle peeps faintly]

07:25.778 --> 07:26.696
[Breana gasping]

07:32.201 --> 07:33.494
And scene!

07:33.578 --> 07:35.496
[students applauding, cheering]

07:35.580 --> 07:37.081
Terrific! Good job.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.001
Thank you.

07:40.084 --> 07:42.378
Okay. Grab a seat, and, uh,

07:43.254 --> 07:44.672
let's talk about this scene.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.550
Or, more specifically,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.844
let's talk about the subject matter

07:50.636 --> 07:51.679
of the scene.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.601
Dying, on camera or on stage,

07:57.477 --> 08:02.857
to play a heartbreaking
and hopefully slow death,

08:03.774 --> 08:06.194
is the dream of every actor.

08:07.528 --> 08:11.908
I would wager there's not an actor
or actress who hasn't fantasized

08:11.991 --> 08:15.703
about how they would play
those final moments.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.373
As the life force slowly slips away

08:19.457 --> 08:24.629
and as we teeter
on the edge of nonexistence,

08:25.713 --> 08:32.011
how would we gasp out those last words
of wit and wisdom?

08:33.012 --> 08:36.349
But is that what happens
as death draws close?

08:36.933 --> 08:41.437
Do the dying exact promises
from those they leave behind?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.148
Do they confess their sins?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.234
Do they make a joke?

08:47.652 --> 08:48.528
Don't get me wrong.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.447
I'm not taking issue with the scene
or the way you guys performed it.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.199
You did a great job.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.120
What I'm asking you to think about…

09:00.122 --> 09:05.461
is what actually happens
in those final moments.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.674
I'm not talking
about a shocking, violent death.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.219
I'm talking about…

09:13.302 --> 09:14.136
[exhales]

09:15.721 --> 09:17.348
…when you know it's coming.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.145
When you've fully surrendered

09:23.980 --> 09:28.359
to the… ultimate magic trick.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.572
When we really and truly

09:34.282 --> 09:35.116
disappear.

09:37.159 --> 09:40.997
[exhales] I've sat at the bedside,
and I've held the hands of friends and…

09:41.747 --> 09:42.999
and loved ones

09:43.916 --> 09:46.335
as they breathed their last breath.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.464
[exhales] And I can tell you this.

09:51.132 --> 09:54.468
The dramatic soliloquy at the end of life

09:54.552 --> 09:57.555
is pure and utter nonsense.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.809
If anything is being said, it's internal.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.023
You can almost hear it.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.029
They're having an internal conversation

10:13.112 --> 10:17.366
filled with disbelief and… and… and wonder

10:18.576 --> 10:22.163
that their life has come to an end.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.336
They hardly notice you
sitting there at all.

10:30.838 --> 10:31.922
For the dying,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.092
the living are irrelevant.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.641
[clears throat] So,

10:42.558 --> 10:46.228
if you should ever have
the opportunity to play such a scene,

10:47.521 --> 10:49.482
approach it with reverence.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.776
Consider it holy.

10:53.235 --> 10:56.280
Make sure it receives your utmost care

10:58.032 --> 10:59.116
and respect.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.665
Uh, okay. [chuckles]

11:05.748 --> 11:07.124
Uh, that's enough from me.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.294
Um, before we call it a night,
I have an announcement to make.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.714
Sort of a good news,
bad news kind of thing.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.632
Um…

11:15.424 --> 11:17.009
The good news is

11:17.093 --> 11:19.720
yours truly has been cast in a movie.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.681
-[gasps] Wow!
-[all exclaiming]

11:21.764 --> 11:24.308
Thank you. I'm very excited too.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.852
Last time I was
in front of a camera was at the DMV.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.312
[all laughing]

11:28.396 --> 11:31.732
The bad news is I will not be here
for a few months.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.151
Obviously, if you prepaid
for your classes,

11:34.235 --> 11:35.611
you'll be fully reimbursed,

11:35.695 --> 11:39.824
or if you want to continue working,
Mindy will be taking over my classes.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.075
I want my money back.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.535
It's your call.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.413
-I'd like to keep working with Mindy.
-Yeah. Me too.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.665
-Mindy's cool.
-I'll stick around.

11:47.748 --> 11:48.708
Yeah. Why not?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.876
I changed my mind. I'll stay.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.213
Sandy,
I'm so happy for you about the movie.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.591
-Thank you, Margaret.
-You're gonna be awesome.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.010
I'm gonna miss you.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.596
All of you.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.183
I'm annoying? I'm annoying?
I'm trying to eat a meal by myself.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.478
If you wanna give him the sandwich,
give him the sandwich. If you don't--

12:09.562 --> 12:12.231
-[man] Well, look at his eyes!
-I ask one simple question…

12:12.314 --> 12:16.110
It's hard to believe these guys were
all unknown actors when Barry cast 'em.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.113
If you can see 'em. Can you see 'em?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.698
Everybody can see 'em, Martin.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.118
Is that Kevin Bacon? He's so tiny.

12:25.244 --> 12:29.331
Hey, ask Levinson if… if he's a nice guy,
'cause I heard otherwise.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.292
I'll be sure to bring it up with him.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.170
Could we just take a break for a moment?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.589
You okay? You need anything?

12:36.672 --> 12:39.216
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I just--

12:39.717 --> 12:40.843
Well, I wanna talk.

12:41.552 --> 12:45.181
First of all, I want to apologize
for not being honest

12:45.264 --> 12:47.933
about what was going on with me.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.435
I thought that I could--

12:49.518 --> 12:52.480
Well, I-- I don't know
what I was thinking. [chuckles]

12:52.563 --> 12:53.606
It was stupid.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.026
Mom, you're entitled to your privacy.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.737
No. I can't, in good conscience,

12:59.820 --> 13:03.157
call this one stupid,
unless I call it on myself.

13:04.074 --> 13:04.909
Thank you.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.788
Second, I'd like to see
this wedding happen sooner

13:08.871 --> 13:09.789
rather than later.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.876
I'll try to help with the planning
all I can, but as you can see,

13:13.959 --> 13:16.378
there's not… there's not much I can do.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.131
Oh, no, no, no.
We… we'll make all the arrangements.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.592
-You don't have to do anything.
-Oh.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.554
Well, one request.
I do want to walk Mindy down the aisle.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.724
Uh, that's my job.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.643
Really?
You're gonna make an issue of this?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.979
-No.
-We could do it together.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.439
I… I… I'm good with that.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.484
Oh, and, Martin, of course, I assume

13:38.567 --> 13:40.986
you'll want to walk down the aisle
with your mother.

13:44.073 --> 13:48.077
Sure. Yeah. Or I could fly solo.
I don't know. [chuckles] Either way.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.038
She's-- You know, she's-- The thing is
she's not really much of a walker.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.581
She teaches cha-cha.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.918
Martin, you really should do it
with your mom.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.673
[mouthing]

14:00.756 --> 14:02.633
Whatever. [chuckles] Sure. Okay.

14:03.759 --> 14:07.179
And I was thinking,
if we want to keep it simple,

14:07.263 --> 14:10.891
we could have the ceremony and the party
at your studio.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.226
Well, I… I love that.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.144
I thought you might.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.106
Oh, and of course you pick
your favorite restaurant

14:17.189 --> 14:18.399
to do all the catering.

14:18.482 --> 14:22.194
-Okay.
-Although you can't go wrong with Spago.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.575
We'll keep it small and intimate
with just close friends and family.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.744
-Sounds right.
-And a DJ instead of a band.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.331
Okay, but… but playing records, right?
Not the scratchy thing?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.292
-Yeah.
-You know? I don't like that.

14:36.375 --> 14:41.046
Now, do either of you have a minister
or… or rabbi or… or priest

14:41.130 --> 14:42.590
that you want to do the wedding?

14:43.173 --> 14:44.049
No.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.094
Fine. Then I'll do it.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.513
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to contribute

14:49.597 --> 14:52.016
to the centerpieces
and floral arrangements,

14:52.099 --> 14:53.893
boutonnieres, et cetera.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.810
Sure.

14:54.894 --> 14:59.231
And you can pay for the rehearsal dinner
and the bachelor party.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.652
You got some guys you'd like to invite
to a bachelor party?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.195
Most of my friends are dead.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.532
-Great. I can afford an open bar.
-Oh.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.412
Okay. Well, sounds like a plan. [chuckles]

15:14.163 --> 15:17.124
-It's getting late. We're gonna turn in.
-Yeah?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.792
-[Mindy] Yeah.
-Okay.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.170
Good night. [chuckles]

15:21.253 --> 15:22.922
-[Mindy] Night.
-[Roz] Good night.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.175
First she's too sick to plan anything,
then she plans everything?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.343
Just keep walking.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.931
Martin? I am really looking forward
to meeting your mom.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.477
Ah, yeah, I'm sure
you… you two will hit it off.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.063
[Roz laughs]

15:39.146 --> 15:41.231
That is such fun.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.943
-I told you.
-[both laughing]

15:48.405 --> 15:50.574
-You all comfy?
-Yes.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.786
-Hmm. Want another blanket?
-No. I'm fine.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.703
Okay.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.623
You got water, meds, book, phone.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.210
-Anything else that you need?
-No. That's it.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.004
Okay. I'm off.

16:05.965 --> 16:06.799
What, no tongue?

16:06.882 --> 16:09.468
Ooh, you want tongue.
I'll give you tongue.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.929
-Oh, shit, no. I was just bluffing.
-[both laugh]

16:12.012 --> 16:13.889
Uh, you gonna read,
or should I get the lights?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.599
-Oh, get the lights. [exhales]
-Okay.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.730
-Good night.
-Good night.

I think you're gonna get an Oscar.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.629
Okay.
If you're gonna be ridiculous, never mind.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.632
Why? No, you're doing great work.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.676
And I should know. I'm a doctor.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.804
Okay, fine. [chuckles] Thanks.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.473
It's gonna be released
on one of those streaming deals anyway,

18:19.556 --> 18:21.141
so it won't be eligible for an Oscar.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.019
-Nobel Peace Prize.
-]Sandy] There you go.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.479
-[laughs]
-[phone vibrates]

18:26.396 --> 18:27.648
Ah, Mindy.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.274
-[phone beeps]
-Yeah. Hi, Min.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.777
No. We're… we're on our way.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.405
Great. I'm looking forward to meeting her.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.116
-Who?
-Martin's mother just arrived.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.701
Should we stop and get a bottle of wine?

18:40.994 --> 18:43.580
-What? That's terrible.
-What happened?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.541
No. No, that's not right.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.376
-What's not right?
-Hold on.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.088
Martin's mother made a joke
about Mindy's weight.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.924
-What kind of joke?
-Is there a good kind?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.469
Honey, listen. She's a stupid old woman.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.762
Just ignore her.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.391
-Ah, damn. Asshole.
-What asshole?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.934
No. You're right.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.187
He has to defend you.
Otherwise, what good is he?

19:07.271 --> 19:08.438
Is this Martin?

19:08.939 --> 19:11.024
He said nothing.
He just giggled like a little boy.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.443
All right. Listen-- No.

19:13.527 --> 19:17.156
Wait.
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.368
Yeah. All right. I'll ask.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.039
She's really upset,
and she doesn't want to stay there.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.916
Of course. She doesn't have to ask.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.712
-He says of course.
-Wait, wait, wait. Well, what about you?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.172
What you do mean, "What about me?"

19:33.255 --> 19:35.174
I'm not staying
with Martin and his mother.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.592
Right. Yeah. You're right.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.136
She says thank you.
Honey, do me a favor.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.764
Throw all my stuff in the suitcase
and, uh, bring it with you, okay?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.266
Yeah. We'll meet you there.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.352
And, sweetheart, don't worry.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.438
This will all work out.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.939
I love you too.

19:51.815 --> 19:52.858
-Bye.
-[phone beeps]

19:55.819 --> 19:57.613
-Well, shit.
-Yeah.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.658
You know, I just have the two bedrooms.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.911
-You got a couch?
-Yeah.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.121
Then you'll be fine.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.543
I don't blame her. She's not the problem.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.046
She's just an evil, old, brain-dead cunt.

20:14.129 --> 20:14.963
It's him.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.841
He doesn't have the balls
to stand up to her!

20:17.925 --> 20:20.010
Some honey for my honey?

20:23.222 --> 20:26.058
I'm just glad this happened now
before the wedding.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.228
Otherwise, I'd be shackled
to that mama's boy for life.

20:34.024 --> 20:34.858
Yes.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.069
Martin should have said something,

20:37.152 --> 20:39.571
but that doesn't mean he's not a good guy.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.115
He's just trying
to be respectful of his mom.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.200
[Mindy] Fuck him!

20:43.283 --> 20:47.537
The whole time she was picking me apart,
he was looking down at his shoes.

20:47.621 --> 20:51.250
Stupid, ugly homemade shoes.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.293
You got anything stronger?

20:53.877 --> 20:55.796
-Uh, bourbon?
-Bring it!

20:56.964 --> 20:58.632
I don't care how old she is.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.550
I don't take that shit from anybody.

21:00.634 --> 21:01.677
Nor should you.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.847
The last person who talked to me like that
is still looking for his left nut.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.474
[Roz] Oh my. Um…

21:07.557 --> 21:11.061
You know, I think it would be a good idea
if we all got a good night's sleep

21:11.144 --> 21:12.896
and revisit this in the morning.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.731
There's nothing to revisit.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.192
The wedding's off. Good night.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.362
[exhales]

21:20.445 --> 21:21.530

21:22.739 --> 21:23.573
Really?

-[car door slams]
-[Sandy grunts] I got a five a.m. call.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.585
Look what I'm doing.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.005
[spits]

21:38.755 --> 21:39.631
[banging on door]

21:40.299 --> 21:43.302
-What the hell? You'll wake her up.
-Ask me if I give a shit.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.722
You need to go to my house,
get down on your knees

21:46.805 --> 21:48.849
and beg Mindy to forgive you.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.517
Okay. It's… it's a little late.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.228
Can I beg first thing in the morning
when I'm fresh?

21:53.312 --> 21:56.732
-[Estelle] What's going on?
-Oh, hi, Mom. Uh, this is Sandy.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.066
That's Mindy's dad.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.860
-This is, uh, my mom.
-Nice to meet you.

21:59.943 --> 22:03.322
-Do you have any idea what time it is?
-I know exactly what time it is.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.324
So, what, you just don't care
about other people?

22:05.407 --> 22:08.201
You bang on doors and shoot your mouth off
while they're trying to sleep?

22:08.285 --> 22:09.786
I'm here to keep your son

22:09.870 --> 22:12.456
from losing the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.083
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to him.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.461
And your daughter
wouldn't have run crying to Daddy

22:17.544 --> 22:19.921
if you raised her
to withstand a little criticism.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.299
You're questioning how I raised my kid?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.675
Look at this mutt.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.802
Is this what you call a success story?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.721
Okay. That's uncalled for.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.557
Let me tell you something, Sammy--

22:30.640 --> 22:31.516
Sandy.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.851
Sandy?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.354
There's nothing Sandy about you.

22:36.313 --> 22:40.150
My Martin has done very well for himself,
despite the fact

22:40.233 --> 22:42.194
that he's had to overcome many handicaps.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.653
Wait a minute. What handicaps?

22:43.737 --> 22:46.448
And if, at this point in his life,

22:46.531 --> 22:49.493
he has chosen your daughter
to settle down with--

22:49.576 --> 22:50.869
Settle down?

22:50.952 --> 22:52.954
He's an old man with a shitty ticker!

22:53.038 --> 22:54.873
He's down, lady, okay? He's down.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.166
Again, kinda hurtful.

22:56.249 --> 23:00.921
