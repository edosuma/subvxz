00:00.826 --> 00:03.078
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.120 --> 00:06.998
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:07.040 --> 00:11.084
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:11.126 --> 00:14.713
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.755 --> 00:16.840
'These are their stories.'

00:17.757 --> 00:21.761
I'm Sarah Logan.
You've seen me interviewing other people.

00:21.802 --> 00:25.680
I'm not comfortable in the first person,
but here goes.

00:25.722 --> 00:30.434
On January 11th,
I interviewed a refugee from East Timor.

00:30.476 --> 00:36.482
It ran past midnight. I was only
nine blocks from home, so I walked.

00:36.523 --> 00:40.109
'My trip home took me
past this swimming pool.

00:40.151 --> 00:44.321
'This is where two men grabbed me
from behind and raped me.

00:44.363 --> 00:47.991
'They put a coat over my face
and dragged me here.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.618
'They said they'd kill me if I made a sound.

00:50.660 --> 00:56.249
'One wore a running suit,
the other had an eye tattooed on his wrist

00:56.290 --> 00:58.959
'and he smelled of clove cigarettes.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.879
'For 12 weeks, some of New York's finest
have worked on my case.

01:03.921 --> 01:07.967
'In spite of their hard work,
they've had no luck finding either man.

01:08.008 --> 01:15.890
'Maybe you know them. I was attacked and
I am going to fight back. I'm Sarah Logan.'

01:18.308 --> 01:19.601
Operator.

01:19.643 --> 01:23.980
No, no, sweetheart.
This is no time for a phone call.

01:29.527 --> 01:34.281
Mark Krieger, a car parts rep.
We met a couple of times for drinks.

01:34.322 --> 01:38.200
- Where?
- Hotel bar. It was a stupid fling.

01:38.242 --> 01:40.411
- Little did I know.
- Did he force you?

01:40.452 --> 01:43.329
- He scared the crap outta me.
- Is that a yes?

01:43.371 --> 01:46.958
I don't wanna press charges.
I just wanted to help.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.501
OK, so, give us the key.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:11.103 --> 02:13.272
- Mark Krieger?
- What?

02:13.314 --> 02:16.649
You're under arrest for rape.
You have the right...

02:16.691 --> 02:19.903
- I know. The right to remain silent.
- To an attorney.

02:19.944 --> 02:25.490
And the damn city has to pay for it,
cos I'm flat-ass broke. Excuse me.

03:19.119 --> 03:22.539
The night we get a call about these pukes,
I'm at a lecture.

03:22.580 --> 03:25.250
- Tell me about Krieger.
- He works construction.

03:25.291 --> 03:30.629
Priors include possession, assaults,
bar fights mostly, kiting cheques.

03:30.671 --> 03:34.674
From Queens, but told his date
he was a car-parts rep from Cleveland.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.384
His date? How reliable is that?

03:36.425 --> 03:40.137
Extremely. She knows she was close
to being a Mr Goodbar victim.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.515
- He lawyered up, went silent.
- What did he feel like?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.059
- What should he feel like?
- I always felt

03:46.101 --> 03:50.229
- this was a rape of opportunity.
- They didn't know who Sarah was.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.648
She's walking, they see her, grab her.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.483
Since we have only one of two suspects,

03:55.525 --> 03:58.778
the DA may have
to make out all the charges

03:58.820 --> 04:01.446
against Krieger
and an unapprehended other.

04:01.488 --> 04:03.699
Keep that in mind.

04:03.740 --> 04:07.451
- Let Krieger lead us to the second guy.
- Try that later.

04:07.493 --> 04:10.913
I wanna try to get the second rapist
before Krieger can warn him.

04:10.955 --> 04:13.124
Which he'll do as soon as he's sober.

04:13.166 --> 04:17.168
Get his phone and employment records,
credit card bills

04:17.209 --> 04:22.130
- and we'll track down number two.
- Anyone tell Sarah we have a suspect?

04:22.173 --> 04:25.134
No, she should hear it from you, John.

04:26.802 --> 04:31.014
John! See my piece?

04:31.055 --> 04:35.809
- I did. It was gutsy and eloquent.
- I'll put that on my epitaph.

04:35.851 --> 04:38.854
'Here lies Sarah Logan,
gutsy and eloquent.'

04:38.896 --> 04:42.940
- Letters of support?
- The response has been amazing.

04:42.982 --> 04:46.402
- It gets better.
- You got them.

04:46.444 --> 04:49.279
One of them. A woman saw your telecast

04:49.321 --> 04:52.949
realised the guy in her bed
matched your description.

04:52.991 --> 04:55.034
His own girlfriend turned him in?

04:55.075 --> 04:58.287
'Girlfriend' suggests more than,
'Hi, let's go to my room.'

04:58.329 --> 05:02.040
- Who is he?
- I'd give you details if I could.

05:02.081 --> 05:04.459
- But?
- It'd endanger the line-up.

05:04.501 --> 05:08.545
This is the man who raped me.
When can you tell me?

05:08.587 --> 05:11.465
The minute this ugly pageant is over.

05:11.507 --> 05:14.467
You remind me so much of my brother.

05:18.596 --> 05:21.848
Well, all right, say this is the guy.

05:21.890 --> 05:24.184
What does that mean? What next?

05:24.226 --> 05:27.311
- We search the man's apartment.
- No, for me.

05:27.353 --> 05:30.648
After the line-up,
we may not see him until court.

05:30.689 --> 05:34.818
Everything we do has to anticipate
any possible defence.

05:34.859 --> 05:38.571
The business side
of innocent till proven guilty.

05:38.613 --> 05:42.866
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- I didn't think you would.

05:46.953 --> 05:50.081
Every collection agency's after this guy.

05:50.122 --> 05:52.458
No bank accounts, no credit cards.

05:52.499 --> 05:55.252
Has a fridge magnet
for a cheque-cashing place.

05:55.293 --> 05:57.379
He works as often as he has to.

05:57.420 --> 05:59.922
Being a rapist is a full-time job.

06:01.215 --> 06:06.219
Pizza takeout, liquor store,
900-Me-So-Horny number.

06:06.261 --> 06:11.683
Three shirts. Two pairs of pants.
No golf clubs, no fishing rods, no nothing.

06:11.724 --> 06:14.143
But a man who clearly likes to smoke.

06:14.184 --> 06:18.272
Maybe souvenirs from one-night stands
with out-of-towners.

06:18.313 --> 06:19.480
Could be.

06:19.522 --> 06:23.359
Every relationship short-term,
every friendship expendable.

06:23.401 --> 06:27.237
How sentimental of us.
We assumed the rapists knew each other.

06:27.279 --> 06:30.615
Maybe number two
was just someone he met.

06:31.408 --> 06:37.496
The White Horse Saloon.
The Black Light. I'm getting all nostalgic.

06:37.538 --> 06:39.622
- Are you joking?
- Well, sort of.

06:39.664 --> 06:42.876
But in a really dark hotel bar,
anything's possible

06:42.917 --> 06:47.504
- up until the seventh or eighth drink.
- Which was closest to the attack?

06:47.546 --> 06:51.674
Uh... that would be Shad's Cabaret
at the Regal Inn.

06:51.716 --> 06:54.719
- Classy.
- There is no Shad, no cabaret.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.555
Just hard-drinking locals
and confused out-of-towners.

06:58.597 --> 07:00.682
Let me know if anything's changed.

07:00.724 --> 07:04.269
Called six contractors
who hardly remember Krieger.

07:04.311 --> 07:06.061
A guy says he knows Krieger.

07:06.103 --> 07:08.981
I said we were friends,
he said to come over.

07:12.525 --> 07:15.820
- What trouble's Mark in?
- He's a suspect in a rape.

07:15.862 --> 07:16.905
Oh.

07:16.946 --> 07:20.699
'Oh'? Isn't that near to 'Gosh,'
or 'That's terrible?'

07:20.741 --> 07:25.077
No, that guy's always in trouble.
Mark didn't know what he'd do

07:25.119 --> 07:27.872
- until a second before he did it.
- Impulsive.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.124
- How do you know him?
- Second cousins.

07:30.166 --> 07:34.419
My mom explained it once.
I think his uncle married my great-aunt.

07:34.461 --> 07:37.506
January 11th, he paged you twice.
Did you see him?

07:37.547 --> 07:40.299
No. Last time I saw him was Labor Day.

07:40.341 --> 07:43.219
The Monsters of Metal tour at the Garden.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.888
- Did you know his friends?
- He didn't really make friends.

07:46.930 --> 07:50.266
Relatives give you a chance
to associate with people

07:50.308 --> 07:53.310
who you'd otherwise never hang out with.

07:54.353 --> 07:59.732
Oh, yeah, that guy owes me 36 bucks.
Mark something. Just a second.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.275
- You know him?
- Nah.

08:01.317 --> 08:04.694
- You let him run a tab?
- He gave me a credit card.

08:04.736 --> 08:09.741
But I ran the bill, so did he.
Here you go. Mark... Krieger, right?

08:09.783 --> 08:12.952
- Was he here with someone?
- How would I know?

08:12.993 --> 08:17.705
Well, the bill. 10 boilermakers on there,
either he drinks a lot or he's with a guy.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.583
Five boilermakers
and five Long Island iced teas?

08:20.625 --> 08:24.461
Maybe he's with a travelling businesswoman
with clouded judgment?

08:24.503 --> 08:26.672
Sorry. Not an itemised bill.

08:26.713 --> 08:30.175
- Got a date on that?
- On the receipt here. January 11th.

08:30.217 --> 08:32.301
You just made my day.

08:34.345 --> 08:36.888
Assistant DA Erika Alden, representing you.

08:36.929 --> 08:40.725
- Who's he?
- Robert Sorenson. I'm his attorney.

08:40.767 --> 08:44.311
- Even slimeballs get lawyers.
- Tell me how this works.

08:44.353 --> 08:46.856
They can't see you, but you can see them.

08:46.897 --> 08:50.525
If you need any man in the line-up
to do anything, tell me.

08:50.567 --> 08:54.612
- I'll relay it to them.
- Take your time. If you don't know,

08:54.654 --> 08:56.989
be sure you don't before giving up.

08:57.030 --> 09:00.200
- No coaching.
- Ignore the twit in the suit.

09:02.244 --> 09:04.996
Let's go. All the way to the end.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.386
I didn't really get a good look at his face.

09:26.014 --> 09:28.308
Ask them to roll up their sleeves.

09:29.516 --> 09:33.562
Roll up your sleeves, please,
and turn your wrists out?

09:44.154 --> 09:47.407
They all have the tattoo. Is this a trick?

09:47.449 --> 09:50.951
We can only ask you
if you recognise any of the men.

10:04.296 --> 10:06.381
It's number three.

10:10.301 --> 10:12.804
Number three's the one who raped me.

10:14.138 --> 10:17.516
Now I can tell you he's Mark Krieger,
a welder from Queens.

10:17.557 --> 10:20.227
Some small-time convictions.

10:20.268 --> 10:23.562
- Did you interrogate him?
- It was a little one-sided.

10:23.604 --> 10:27.858
- He didn't say a word.
- Wait. What about the other guy?

10:27.900 --> 10:32.403
We're still looking for him.
But we can still prosecute Krieger.

10:32.445 --> 10:34.906
It makes a more complicated trial.

10:34.948 --> 10:37.699
Isn't there some way to make Krieger talk?

10:37.741 --> 10:41.453
We chained him to a radiator
and beat his feet.

10:41.495 --> 10:45.498
Come on... I mean some legal manoeuvre.
Some deal?

10:45.540 --> 10:50.460
- His lawyer won't let us talk to him.
- I wanna know who he was with.

10:50.502 --> 10:56.257
- More importantly, I wanna know why.
- I deal with these guys every day.

10:56.298 --> 10:59.552
- Mostly, THEY don't know why.
- There must be a reason.

10:59.593 --> 11:04.305
Drug habit, abused as children,
a withholding mother. Something.

11:04.347 --> 11:09.059
They're excuses rapists tell journalists
and judges once they're convicted.

11:09.101 --> 11:12.229
They parrot psychobabble learned from TV.

11:12.271 --> 11:15.356
- Doesn't make 'em what they are.
- What does?

11:15.398 --> 11:20.236
I don't know, and I'm not going
to give you an easy answer.

11:20.278 --> 11:22.821
These guys do it, we try to stop 'em.

11:22.863 --> 11:27.033
- And that's the world, isn't it?
- I shouldn't've said that.

11:27.075 --> 11:31.996
No. What you're saying is,
you may never find the second guy.

11:32.037 --> 11:35.039
- True.
- And that I may never understand

11:35.081 --> 11:39.419
- why they targeted me?
- Also true.

11:44.673 --> 11:49.635
Well, you haven't soft-soaped me yet.
Don't start now, OK?

11:49.677 --> 11:50.803
OK.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.188
Three calls in two days
from One, Police Plaza

12:02.229 --> 12:04.607
pointedly asking how her case is going.

12:04.648 --> 12:07.525
We have DNA, a witness placing him
in the neighbourhood

12:07.567 --> 12:09.652
and Logan, who'll be great on the stand.

12:09.694 --> 12:12.447
But still no number two
after almost a month!

12:12.489 --> 12:16.992
We showed mug shots to all of Krieger's
ex-colleagues, to his landlords,

12:17.034 --> 12:20.620
at every bar that he ever
stole an ashtray from and no one bit.

12:20.661 --> 12:24.290
Krieger didn't keep friends for long.
Nobody knew him.

12:24.332 --> 12:28.835
So we don't know if his partner
is from Hoboken or Timbuktu.

12:28.877 --> 12:33.672
- Any long shots?
- My Rikers source 'heard something'.

12:33.714 --> 12:35.800
OK, I'll take it.

12:39.303 --> 12:44.808
Your daughter's teacher will cut her
some slack. Maybe summer school.

12:44.849 --> 12:48.602
- Principal's looking out for her.
- I appreciate it, man.

12:48.644 --> 12:53.189
- It's OK. Let's talk about Krieger.
- Everybody knows who he is,

12:53.231 --> 12:58.945
cos of that news lady. I hear, number one,
he didn't know it was her when he did it.

12:58.986 --> 13:04.116
- And, two, he's scared he's going down.
- What about the other guy?

13:04.157 --> 13:07.576
What I hear? The guy was already in Rikers.

13:07.618 --> 13:11.288
On a DUI or shoplifting or some trifle, right?

13:11.330 --> 13:16.167
Krieger finds him, tells him,
'Keep your mouth shut, I owe you one.'

13:16.209 --> 13:19.920
- 'Talk, you're dead.'
- How'd you hear about this?

13:21.004 --> 13:25.134
We were watching some tube
in the big room, her story came on.

13:25.175 --> 13:29.387
- I heard some guys talking.
- This is what you're giving me?

13:29.429 --> 13:32.140
Give me details, a name.

13:33.849 --> 13:37.018
I wish I did, but I don't. All right?

13:37.060 --> 13:39.728
And I like that news lady.

13:39.770 --> 13:43.315
And Krieger... He's a waste of space.

13:43.357 --> 13:47.652
Do you want everyone admitted on that day
or everyone who was in?

13:47.694 --> 13:50.822
- Everyone.
- I have 16,000 detainees.

13:50.864 --> 13:54.825
- Forget women and adolescents.
- Now you're down to 12,000.

13:54.867 --> 13:59.454
- Tell me what you're looking for.
- He crossed paths with Mark Krieger.

13:59.495 --> 14:03.166
Krieger. In the main population.
Want a list or a disk?

14:03.207 --> 14:07.169
- How many names are we talking?
- 6,204.

14:07.210 --> 14:10.213
Can we sort 'em by age or race or...?

14:10.255 --> 14:12.339
- No.
- Disk.

14:15.676 --> 14:20.013
Krieger's lawyer is pressing for a quick trial,

14:20.054 --> 14:23.099
- hoping we're unprepared.
- It's open and shut.

14:23.141 --> 14:26.852
- He'll try to make Sarah look flaky.
- Her story's solid.

14:26.894 --> 14:30.481
- She never varies a detail.
- She said she was raped by two men.

14:30.522 --> 14:34.358
We can only show the jury one.
She took an unusual route home

14:34.400 --> 14:38.112
and Sorenson will insinuate
that it was more than just a nice walk.

14:38.154 --> 14:41.907
- No semen from the second rapist.
- He used a condom.

14:41.948 --> 14:46.243
I know. I'm just letting you know
how he'll defend his client.

14:46.285 --> 14:50.247
- So...?
- Sarah's not ready for trial yet.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.417
She trusts you.
Talk to her, let her know it'll get ugly.

14:54.459 --> 14:58.378
Benson saw a similar case fall apart
last year. She knows what can happen.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.839
- Ask her for help.
- Thanks.

15:02.758 --> 15:06.469
The defence can no longer bring up
your sexual history.

15:06.511 --> 15:09.305
- That's not allowed.
- They can allude to it.

15:09.347 --> 15:13.517
If they can. They've no obligation
to explain what did or didn't happen.

15:13.558 --> 15:18.187
They can muddy the waters enough
so jurors feel OK voting not guilty.

15:18.229 --> 15:21.565
To generate confusion,
they'll try to beat you up on the stand.

15:21.607 --> 15:23.692
- Like how?
- It's a rape case,

15:23.776 --> 15:27.070
so they have to ask you
who put what where, when and how.

15:27.112 --> 15:31.448
- Where were you, where was Krieger?
- Where was the other guy?

15:31.490 --> 15:34.868
- How do you know it was Krieger?
- I get it. All right?

15:34.910 --> 15:37.413
Just an idea of what it'll be like.

15:37.454 --> 15:41.749
I understand. Is there anything else?

15:43.126 --> 15:47.212
Answer as specifically
and with as much detail as possible.

15:47.254 --> 15:52.967
Be direct. Don't use euphemisms,
say 'penis', say 'vagina', say 'intercourse'.

15:53.008 --> 15:56.303
If these words
make you feel uncomfortable, call me,

15:56.345 --> 16:00.473
call Munch, tell us the story over
and over until you feel comfortable.

16:00.515 --> 16:04.435
If they think you're uncomfortable,
they'll go over the same thing

16:04.476 --> 16:07.438
five different ways, just to see you sweat.

16:07.479 --> 16:10.898
OK. So... what happens next week?

16:10.940 --> 16:13.526
Pre-trial manoeuvring, jury selection.

16:13.568 --> 16:18.280
Arcane, tedious proceedings
mostly concerning Krieger's rights.

16:18.321 --> 16:20.782
Sarah, this could be ugly.

16:22.576 --> 16:24.660
Not as ugly as what happened.

16:29.039 --> 16:32.667
- Filing three motions at once?
- Four, Your Honour.

16:32.709 --> 16:36.670
Questioning the arrest's constitutionality
and the DNA procedure.

16:36.712 --> 16:41.383
- Moving for dismissal. That's three.
- You flipped right past it.

16:41.425 --> 16:44.177
OK. Here it is.

16:44.802 --> 16:47.638
'Motion to suppress the witness ID.'

16:47.680 --> 16:50.015
Quite the ambitious defence.

16:50.057 --> 16:53.018
Have the People got copies
of this paperwork blizzard?

16:53.060 --> 16:57.855
- We just received them, Your Honour.
- The People are filing... one motion.

16:57.897 --> 17:02.276
- What is this?
- To exclude press from the court.

17:02.318 --> 17:04.986
- Simple enough.
- To preserve her exclusive?

17:05.028 --> 17:07.446
- No, to preserve decorum.
- Your Honour,

17:07.489 --> 17:12.451
the press's presence helps ensure
fairness in this high-profile case.

17:12.492 --> 17:15.996
And you think more press
will lower the profile?

17:16.038 --> 17:20.875
I'll balance that against the possibility
some counsellors want their names in print.

17:20.916 --> 17:23.460
I'll rule tomorrow. Adjourned.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.922
I didn't know he'd be here.

17:26.963 --> 17:31.342
- Rights of the accused.
- Why challenge my identification?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.136
- The line-up was fair.
- His only hope

17:34.178 --> 17:38.014
is to prove the police and the victim
are incompetent.

17:38.056 --> 17:40.725
- Is it always that way?
- He's playing games.

17:40.767 --> 17:44.144
Usually he'd cop a plea
and get on with it. I don't get it.

17:44.186 --> 17:46.730
It's me, isn't it? Just tell me.

17:46.772 --> 17:52.235
You do bring attention to the case.
If Sorenson wins, everybody'll know.

17:52.276 --> 17:55.321
Next time a millionaire kills his mistress...

17:55.363 --> 17:58.031
So fight fire with fire. Come on my show.

17:58.073 --> 18:02.326
We'll talk about this exact view.
I won't hold back from my audience.

18:02.368 --> 18:07.623
- I have to check with Cragen.
- He cleared it. Be at my studio at seven.

18:07.665 --> 18:10.709
- Wear a nice coat and tie.
- This is a nice coat and tie.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.503
- Nervous, are you?
- Just concerned

18:13.545 --> 18:17.464
that some legal and emotional
grey areas that inform my worldview

18:17.506 --> 18:19.174
will get lost in sound bites.

18:19.216 --> 18:24.554
Ooh! Your voice changes a tiny bit
when you're spinning. I know you.

18:24.595 --> 18:28.390
Ask Alden. A woman's better
when the subject's rape.

18:28.432 --> 18:31.852
- I want my viewers to see you.
- Or Jeffries or Benson.

18:31.893 --> 18:35.187
If victims see you they may be
more likely to go the police.

18:35.229 --> 18:37.732
I'm just a cop who caught the case.

18:37.773 --> 18:39.859
You're not.

18:40.359 --> 18:44.070
Please. Do I have to bribe you?

18:45.113 --> 18:48.907
OK, fine. I will take you to dinner afterwards.

18:48.949 --> 18:54.580
All right. Just don't say 'bribe'
to a cop in a crowded courthouse.

18:54.621 --> 18:56.039
OK.

19:07.049 --> 19:09.717
- Trying to find her.
- Where can she be?

19:09.759 --> 19:12.636
Traffic. There's hellish gridlock

19:12.678 --> 19:15.513
in her neighbourhood.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.808
Who's this?

19:20.101 --> 19:21.602
What?

19:21.643 --> 19:24.813
- Tell me what happened!
- Captain says you can't go in.

19:24.855 --> 19:26.940
- What happened?
- Please stay back.

19:26.982 --> 19:29.776
- I'm goin' in.
- We need the area secured.

19:29.817 --> 19:32.445
- I can do that.
- We don't need anybody else hurt!

19:32.487 --> 19:34.696
- Who got hurt?
- I don't know.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.158
- The ambulance is still here, why?
- We need to secure...

19:38.200 --> 19:41.535
- I'm goin' in.
- The Captain says you can't.

19:41.619 --> 19:43.954
- John... John.
- It's Sarah.

19:44.872 --> 19:47.957
- But the ambulance is still here.
- John.

19:49.709 --> 19:53.213
- When?
- Neighbours reported a single blast.

19:53.254 --> 19:58.008
Bomb squad got the call at 6:46,
arrived on scene at 6:52.

19:58.050 --> 20:03.721
- Six minutes?
- It wouldn't've mattered. I'm sorry.

20:07.182 --> 20:11.019
- How did it happen?
- I think homemade black powder bomb.

20:11.061 --> 20:14.605
Anarchist Cookbook crap,
concealed in a box of flowers.

20:14.647 --> 20:19.026
My guess is she finds the flower box
outside, carries it inside with her.

20:19.068 --> 20:20.610
- Flowers.
- Yeah.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.154
She was by the window
when the blast occurred.

20:23.196 --> 20:28.075
Her body blocked the shockwave from the
north side of the room.

20:29.076 --> 20:33.413
It's... it's just pieces.
But I don't think she suffered much.

20:33.454 --> 20:34.664
She suffered.

20:34.706 --> 20:38.793
- I meant she was killed instantly.
- I know what you mean.

20:50.511 --> 20:53.596
I saved those.
I thought you might want them.

20:54.973 --> 20:57.642
- Great.
- How late did you stay on scene?

20:57.684 --> 21:00.394
Late. Benson's still there, canvassing.

21:06.441 --> 21:08.860
OK, what do you guys know?

21:08.901 --> 21:12.696
My source says the second perp
may have been at Rikers

21:12.738 --> 21:15.824
- the day Krieger was admitted.
- One of 6,000 men.

21:15.866 --> 21:19.994
We've narrowed that down to 207 men,
right age and description

21:20.036 --> 21:23.289
who were out on the street
when the rape occurred.

21:23.331 --> 21:26.333
The theory is that the bomber is rapist two?

21:26.374 --> 21:30.045
- Right.
- It changes the conception of the rape.

21:30.086 --> 21:33.922
It makes number two the alpha male,
Krieger the sidekick.

21:33.964 --> 21:36.425
So we can't link Krieger to the bomb.

21:36.467 --> 21:40.553
Alden says Logan's testimony
can be admitted via Geraci.

21:40.595 --> 21:44.140
We must suggest
Krieger masterminded the bombing.

21:44.182 --> 21:47.768
By all accounts,
he couldn't mastermind a church picnic.

21:47.809 --> 21:51.897
If he wasn't part of the bombing,
her statements are inadmissible

21:51.938 --> 21:55.649
- and Krieger walks!
- OK, this is what we'll do.

21:55.691 --> 21:58.735
Munch, Jeffries,
you pursue the rape case.

21:58.777 --> 22:03.198
Elliot, you and Benson are on the bombing.
If it points to Krieger, tell Munch.

22:03.239 --> 22:09.286
If it doesn't, keep it to yourself until
the trial is over. John, you got a minute?

22:15.041 --> 22:17.919
Did you... reach the brother?

22:17.960 --> 22:22.464
He listened and said,
'She's not coming back for the funeral.'

22:22.506 --> 22:27.009
I see. You want some time off,
John, I understand.

22:28.302 --> 22:31.055
No, I don't. But thanks.

22:32.681 --> 22:34.766
OK.

22:39.103 --> 22:43.190
The device was pretty simple,
packed into a soup can.

22:43.232 --> 22:46.442
- A soup can?
- Extra-chunky chicken and noodle.

22:46.484 --> 22:49.654
Amateurishly built,
held together with masking tape.

22:49.696 --> 22:51.114
The explosive?

22:51.155 --> 22:53.699
Chinese black powder
and a flammable liquid.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.493
It went off when
she pulled the lid off the box?

22:56.535 --> 23:01.872
No, it was by remote. A garage door
receiver was hooked to a detonator.

23:01.914 --> 23:06.001
OK, so we got a soup can bomb
any moron can make,

23:06.042 --> 23:09.421
yet he goes to the trouble
of putting a remote on it?

23:09.462 --> 23:12.881
A first-timer?
Maybe a hired gun, eliminate a witness?

23:12.923 --> 23:16.593
No. He's doing a lot more
than eliminating a witness.

23:16.635 --> 23:19.804
- I'm not following.
- Look at the risk he took.

23:19.846 --> 23:23.516
He used a bomb, not a gun,
put it in a box of flowers,

23:23.558 --> 23:27.853
the essence of the romantic gesture.
He could have put a switch on it.

23:27.894 --> 23:33.316
Instead he rigs it to a remote.
Her life was in his hands.

23:33.357 --> 23:38.403
Did your guys search the park
opposite her apartment?

23:38.445 --> 23:43.283
- No. We didn't know where he was.
- Wanna bet he was there?

23:43.325 --> 23:48.162
That's why he went to all that trouble.
He wanted to watch her die.

23:48.704 --> 23:51.164
You can see into her apartment from here.

23:51.205 --> 23:55.043
Throat lozenge packages here.
Maybe our boy's got a cold.

23:55.084 --> 23:58.086
It was pretty freezing last night.

23:58.128 --> 24:04.592
He had to find her address, find this
viewing spot, make a bomb, deliver it.

24:04.633 --> 24:06.677
And while he was standing here...

24:06.719 --> 24:11.264
- Moves his thumb, kills her.
- This guy's nothing like Krieger.

24:11.306 --> 24:15.935
- He went to incredible lengths.
- Two different MOs and motives.

24:15.977 --> 24:21.023
Number two guy seems to be a planner,
Krieger jumps in at the last minute.

24:21.065 --> 24:23.150
Went along just for the ride.

24:30.947 --> 24:35.202
Counsel Alden. Counsel Sorenson.
Or should I call you Mr Motion?

24:35.243 --> 24:37.828
It's the last I'll burden you with.

24:37.870 --> 24:42.166
After last night's events,
you want to quash the indictment?

24:42.208 --> 24:45.794
Without the key witness,
they can't prove their case.

24:45.835 --> 24:46.920
Counsel Alden?

24:46.961 --> 24:51.590
We have DNA, witnesses who place
the defendant in the area at the time.

24:51.632 --> 24:53.968
Semen without a witness to alleged force,

24:54.009 --> 24:56.803
does not prove rape,
only indicates a sex act.

24:56.844 --> 24:59.555
We'd like to amend the indictment
under People v Geraci

24:59.597 --> 25:02.225
to include Logan's diary and statements.

25:02.266 --> 25:04.768
Geraci requires the People to show

25:04.810 --> 25:09.438
that a defendant's misconduct
rendered a witness unavailable.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.441
- It's a prima facie case.
- I'll need more.

25:12.483 --> 25:15.611
- Who benefited from her death?
- Maybe he did,

25:15.653 --> 25:19.698
but so did the other suspect
and he's on the outside.

25:19.739 --> 25:23.826
I should moot the indictment,
but I'll give the People seven days

25:23.867 --> 25:26.203
to link the bombing to the defendant.

25:26.245 --> 25:28.956
If so, Logan's statements can be admitted.

25:28.998 --> 25:33.334
- The People appreciate it.
- I want to note that my client is being held

25:33.376 --> 25:37.296
under a de facto nul indictment,
which in an appeal could seem biased.

25:37.337 --> 25:41.341
- Are you challenging my impartiality?
- We are now doubly burdened

25:41.383 --> 25:44.677
with a rape defence
and a Geraci on the bombing.

25:44.719 --> 25:48.014
I request bail, so my client
may prepare a defence.

25:48.055 --> 25:51.766
Fine. Bail is set at $50,000. Happy now?

25:51.808 --> 25:54.602
No! We're unhappy, Your Honour.

25:54.644 --> 25:58.147
No victim, no rape? Why not declare
open season on all women?

25:58.188 --> 26:01.692
- Who are you?
- Detective John Munch, SVU.

26:01.734 --> 26:06.446
- You are seriously out of line.
- Whose pocket are you in anyway?

26:08.572 --> 26:12.784
- What did you say?
- I said, whose pocket are you in?

26:13.785 --> 26:16.912
I'm fining you $500 for contempt of court.

26:16.954 --> 26:20.166
Make it a thousand. Better than
contempt for common sense.

26:20.207 --> 26:24.461
$1,000. Say another word
and I'll put you in the lockup!

26:24.961 --> 26:26.546
John, don't. Let's go.

26:26.588 --> 26:30.090
If this gets out,
every rapist will kill his victim.

26:30.132 --> 26:34.386
We'll make him. Krieger's cousin
just paged me. We're not dead yet.

26:35.178 --> 26:40.516
I saw the news and it reminded me
of a guy Mark knew. Named Tommy.

26:40.558 --> 26:43.143
Why didn't you tell us before?

26:43.185 --> 26:46.938
How to put this?
We did a little business together.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.899
He sold you drugs?
We don't give a rat's ass.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.485
- Is he still dealing?
- No. He got out.

26:52.526 --> 26:56.780
He said he'd be a made man. They gave
him a gas station to run in Jersey.

26:56.821 --> 27:01.200
- Big promotion. Where in Jersey?
- I don't know.

27:01.241 --> 27:04.286
You got a last name
for this gas-pumping wise guy?

27:04.328 --> 27:06.538
Something Irish.

27:06.580 --> 27:09.916
There are two million Irish
in New York, PK.

27:09.958 --> 27:15.420
Good luck. Hey, um, if he's the guy,
do I get the reward?

27:16.713 --> 27:18.590
Buy yourself a blunt.

27:21.467 --> 27:24.303
McCormick, McConaugh, Milligan...

27:24.345 --> 27:28.723
Flaherty, Gleeson, Kilpatrick,
all late of Rikers Island.

27:28.765 --> 27:32.352
18 Tommys 'Something Irish' in the lockup

27:32.394 --> 27:36.772
- when Krieger was booked.
- These people saved civilisation.

27:36.814 --> 27:40.608
He was drinking with Krieger
the night Krieger stiffed me?

27:40.650 --> 27:43.611
- Night he raped the woman?
- Here's Krieger.

27:43.653 --> 27:47.155
Maybe if you see 'em side by side,
it'll jog your memory.

27:47.197 --> 27:50.242
That's it. Young, half-grey hair.

27:50.284 --> 27:53.786
- He's the one.
- Tommy McConaugh.

27:53.828 --> 27:55.913
Thanks.

27:57.873 --> 28:00.250
Hey! Hey!

28:00.292 --> 28:04.379
I can't get gas! The pump don't work!
I gotta go to work!

28:04.421 --> 28:07.756
- What?
- The pump's locked! I gotta go to work.

28:07.798 --> 28:10.718
- Wait a second.
- Come on, man.

28:17.348 --> 28:20.726
Put your hands on your head
where we can see 'em!

28:25.147 --> 28:29.692
You sold weed to an undercover cop
about a month ago.

28:29.734 --> 28:32.737
- That was a total setup.
- I don't care about that.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.947
- They kept you in Rikers for a week.
- Yeah.

28:35.989 --> 28:40.951
That's where Krieger told you
not to mention that night in January?

28:43.203 --> 28:47.248
- The night you partied at Shad's.
- He told you?

28:48.458 --> 28:51.878
Now, why do you think
he doesn't want you to talk?

28:54.212 --> 28:56.632
Huh? Cos he's pinning it all on you.

28:56.673 --> 29:01.260
Now, he's walking,
and you're looking at ten years.

29:02.845 --> 29:07.599
- That is not how it went down, man.
- That is the way it's goin' down

29:07.641 --> 29:10.435
until I hear your side of the story!

29:14.563 --> 29:17.232
Now's your chance. Talk to me.

29:18.192 --> 29:21.110
All right. We were a little high, right?

29:21.152 --> 29:24.656
We were walking around
and we come to this pool.

29:24.697 --> 29:27.157
It's closed for the season, you know?

29:27.199 --> 29:30.702
- I know.
- Krieger says he can pick the lock.

29:30.744 --> 29:35.623
So I dare him. He does.
We go in and it's really quiet and peaceful.

29:35.665 --> 29:40.877
Kinda weird in the middle of winter.
Krieger says something like,

29:40.919 --> 29:44.464
- 'This'd be the perfect place.'
- What's that mean?

29:44.506 --> 29:47.758
That's what I say.
And he says, 'To do a bitch.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.762
'You know, to get some
without the dining and the wining.'

29:51.804 --> 29:56.599
I'm like, 'He must be joking, right?'
But he's not.

29:57.392 --> 29:59.810
- You saw him attack her?
- Yeah.

29:59.851 --> 30:03.355
She's walking by, he just pops her one.

30:03.397 --> 30:08.150
- You saw him rape her?
- Well, I tried not to watch.

30:08.192 --> 30:12.654
What? Are you playing me now?
Are you too modest, is that it?

30:12.696 --> 30:15.949
No, it's just... He's a freak!

30:29.210 --> 30:35.591
You're Irish.
You were raised... to respect women.

30:37.301 --> 30:39.385
Yeah.

30:41.679 --> 30:43.764
Your mother teach you that?

30:45.682 --> 30:48.602
- Yeah.
- Your mother...

30:49.769 --> 30:54.565
Sounds like a good woman.
Be a good son. Give it up.

30:57.443 --> 31:00.361
OK. I saw him do it.

31:00.403 --> 31:04.615
- 'He ripped off her pants.'
- Sorry, Krieger, bail is revoked.

31:04.656 --> 31:08.243
'He threw her down on the ground.
She was whimpering.'

31:08.285 --> 31:09.620
Let's go.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.209
He was there not five minutes ago.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.129
Stop! Police! Freeze!

31:35.475 --> 31:38.310
Krieger, stop! Stop where you are now!

31:44.982 --> 31:47.151
- Let's go!
- Why didn't he stop?

31:47.193 --> 31:49.153
- Let's go.
- Call Cragen.

31:49.195 --> 31:51.112
I'll call him! Come on!

31:55.533 --> 31:59.119
Soup can. Same crappy workmanship,
save flavour soup.

31:59.161 --> 32:02.206
- Was the bomb Krieger's?
- Maybe it an accident.

32:02.248 --> 32:04.916
Not unless he had a death wish
or was stupid.

32:04.958 --> 32:06.084
Why do you say that?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.503
Package that went off took off his package.

32:08.544 --> 32:09.587
Ouch.

32:09.629 --> 32:12.881
- The remote, a garage-door opener?
- Yeah. Click-boom.

32:12.923 --> 32:16.759
- The bomber, how close?
- Within 50 feet. Maybe a rooftop.

32:16.801 --> 32:20.054
- Are you canvassing the area?
- Yeah. So far zippo.

32:20.096 --> 32:22.807
- Hey, you OK?
- I'm not going.

32:22.848 --> 32:25.976
- Stay for observation.
- My partner can do that.

32:26.017 --> 32:28.436
- Who's going to watch me?
- I am.

32:28.478 --> 32:30.062
- You are?
- I am.

32:30.104 --> 32:33.023
- I'm a lot to watch.
- Yeah, you are.

32:33.065 --> 32:36.401
Do me a favour,
take a couple of days for me?

32:37.068 --> 32:42.240
- Fine. For you.
- Keep an eye on her. Take care.

32:43.907 --> 32:48.912
Thanks. They're interviewing everyone
on the scene or who lives near.

32:48.954 --> 32:53.291
- Nothing unusual.
- This isn't Beirut. A bombing is not usual.

32:53.332 --> 32:56.585
We've ruled out political or financial angles?

32:56.626 --> 32:58.670
I'm thinking John Hinkley Jr.

32:58.712 --> 33:02.382
Guy thinks he's got a relationship
with a woman on TV.

33:02.424 --> 33:05.676
She's smart, funny.
He thinks she understands him.

33:05.718 --> 33:09.220
- Dream girl.
- He thinks she shouldn't talk about rape.

33:09.262 --> 33:12.223
Because of his twisted, puritanical mores?

33:12.265 --> 33:15.560
Maybe it's not even religious,
maybe it's just selfish.

33:15.602 --> 33:18.687
But where's the escalation?
The warning signs?

33:18.729 --> 33:21.440
If she'd been threatened,
she would've told us.

33:21.481 --> 33:24.483
She didn't have to know him,
for him to know her.

33:24.525 --> 33:29.029
She got hundreds of cards and letters
when her rape survivor journal aired.

33:29.070 --> 33:34.492
Let's look at those.
Listen, where are you with McConaugh?

33:34.534 --> 33:38.203
He rolled on Krieger,
but confessed to nothing himself.

33:38.245 --> 33:42.498
No witness, no rape.
No Krieger, no case against McConaugh.

33:42.540 --> 33:45.710
It's either a confession or he walks.

33:45.752 --> 33:50.297
- He doesn't know Krieger went boom.
- Right. That's good, good.

33:50.339 --> 33:54.968
Been a while since I tried
the disappointed father figure.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.309
Nap time's over, Tommy. Sit up straight.

34:04.351 --> 34:07.437
Tell me about the night
Sarah Logan was raped.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.481
- I told the other guy.
- No, you lied to him.

34:10.522 --> 34:13.817
But you don't wanna lie to me.
You leave the bar together

34:13.859 --> 34:16.985
and break into the pool -
what happened next?

34:17.027 --> 34:21.907
- It was Krieger's fault.
- Did I ask you whose fault it was?

34:21.949 --> 34:26.995
No! I want you to tell me
what happened next.

34:27.036 --> 34:32.166
OK? All right? Just take it easy.
All right? Close your eyes.

34:32.208 --> 34:37.337
Close your eyes, Tommy. Come on.
Attaboy. I want you to picture it.

34:37.379 --> 34:40.507
Then I want you to tell me what happened.

34:42.632 --> 34:47.887
OK. Krieger did her first while I held her.

34:49.304 --> 34:53.560
Then she says, 'Please don't hurt me.'

34:53.601 --> 34:56.978
Krieger wants to hit her.
I say, 'You better not.'

34:57.020 --> 35:00.482
- So you wanted to protect her?
- Yeah.

35:00.524 --> 35:05.528
I even used a rubber when it came
to my turn. But she doesn't stop crying.

35:05.570 --> 35:10.407
I'm, like, 'I put the rubber on,
why are you still crying?'

35:17.079 --> 35:21.916
'Sarah, may time heal your suffering.
The Sisters of St Joseph's.'

35:21.958 --> 35:25.753
Rape victims, families of victims.
Different ages, races,

35:25.795 --> 35:29.089
- all with the same denominator.
- With one exception.

35:29.131 --> 35:33.093
Where's the guy making bombs
while writing his insipid missives?

35:33.135 --> 35:36.220
- They can test for that.
- Insipid writing?

35:36.262 --> 35:38.347
No, powder residue.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.726
This is it.

35:45.061 --> 35:49.940
- Sort of sulphury.
- Nothing smells like black powder.

35:52.234 --> 35:55.570
'I'm not clowning around,
Please don't make me frown

35:55.612 --> 35:59.532
'Be mine, my sweet Valentine If it isn't you
I don't know what I'll do.'

35:59.574 --> 36:01.992
Course, it isn't signed.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.119
He did us one better.

36:09.373 --> 36:11.334
Bingo.

36:11.375 --> 36:16.713
No match in the NYPD or FBI
fingerprint databases,

36:16.755 --> 36:20.007
- nor in the sex offender database.
- Parolees?

36:20.049 --> 36:22.593
No. Nothing in the bomb squad watch list.

36:22.635 --> 36:27.180
This guy had access to explosives.
Have you tried fire and police employees?

36:27.222 --> 36:30.808
No. Hopefully the psych evaluation
weeds out extremists.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.101
Well, let's look at the weeds.

36:35.437 --> 36:39.774
Name is William Lexner.
Graduated Queens College 1984.

36:39.815 --> 36:43.861
Rejected from the Fire Department
six times. Last time in '99.

36:43.903 --> 36:46.404
'His high scores are eclipsed by narcissism,

36:46.446 --> 36:51.159
'disregard for teamwork,
hostility toward unnamed 'enemies'

36:51.201 --> 36:54.203
'whom he believes prevent him
from being hired.

36:54.245 --> 36:57.873
- 'Application denied.'
- Narcissistic, paranoid,

36:57.915 --> 37:00.458
fascinated with fire - we've hit the trifecta.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.461
See if we can pick him up without incident.

37:03.503 --> 37:07.839
Take the bomb squad along with
because this could get ugly.

37:11.718 --> 37:13.803
Come on, partner, let's go.

37:21.768 --> 37:23.895
This way. Let's go. Let's go.

37:26.897 --> 37:29.900
That's all three floors? You want suits?

37:29.942 --> 37:32.027
- I'm wearing one.
- Smart man.

37:32.068 --> 37:35.405
Bomb suits only make you
a better-looking corpse anyway.

37:35.446 --> 37:37.991
Comforting. We all set?

37:38.032 --> 37:40.117
Let's do it.

37:48.875 --> 37:53.336
- Who's there?
- Certified cheque for Mr Lexner.

37:53.378 --> 37:55.755
A cheque? Who sent me a cheque?

37:55.797 --> 38:00.426
Sir, all I know is, it's for $419
and I need a signature.

38:02.595 --> 38:07.473
Sir, you can get it from me now
or get it re-delivered in six to eight weeks.

38:10.643 --> 38:13.228
OK. Have a nice day.

38:15.230 --> 38:17.566
- How you doing?
- What cheque?

38:17.608 --> 38:19.692
Police! Down!

38:20.067 --> 38:24.155
- Get down! Dammit! Get down!
- John... John! We got him.

38:27.699 --> 38:30.535
- The bomb squad swept his apartment.
- And?

38:30.577 --> 38:33.245
Found powder residue on his clothes.

38:33.287 --> 38:37.333
- But?
- We can't make the case on forensics.

38:37.374 --> 38:40.126
We need a confession, John.

38:40.168 --> 38:42.295
The guy loves this.

38:42.337 --> 38:44.421
I hate it.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.471
- Will?
- Don't see anyone else here.

38:53.513 --> 38:57.933
- Detective John Munch.
- You're the one who handled Sarah's case.

38:57.974 --> 39:01.645
- I was.
- You want to get to know me.

39:01.686 --> 39:03.772
- Yes.
- Why?

39:03.813 --> 39:07.775
You're interesting.
Most sex offenders are all the same.

39:07.816 --> 39:11.319
You don't get
the Nietzschean Superman every day.

39:11.361 --> 39:17.699
Sex crimes. Rape's the worst crime
that there is. Do you know why?

39:18.575 --> 39:20.077
Tell me.

39:21.453 --> 39:23.664
Let's look at twin sisters.

39:24.372 --> 39:26.833
Both beautiful, both smart,

39:26.874 --> 39:30.418
and a man is going
to ask one out on a date.

39:30.460 --> 39:34.381
The only difference is,
one of them was raped.

39:34.422 --> 39:38.884
- So who will the man ask out?
- I don't think it matters.

39:38.926 --> 39:41.428
Oh, but it does.

39:41.470 --> 39:45.098
Once you know, you know.

39:45.807 --> 39:48.101
It doesn't matter if you care.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.103
Really?

39:51.144 --> 39:54.231
You looked at Sarah differently
after the rape?

39:54.273 --> 39:57.441
She never smiled the same.

39:57.483 --> 40:02.780
The rape. The assault. I saw it in her face.

40:02.822 --> 40:07.159
- Saw what?
- You don't think she changed, after?

40:07.200 --> 40:10.035
I'm sure she did,
but not the way you mean.

40:10.077 --> 40:13.205
She grew, used her misfortune
to help other women.

40:13.247 --> 40:17.667
- She was the perfect woman.
- A good woman who did good deeds.

40:17.709 --> 40:20.003
- Mitzvahs.
- Mitzvahs.

40:21.796 --> 40:25.174
- What was she like?
- Why are you asking me?

40:25.215 --> 40:30.845
She mentioned you twice.
Once on April 15th and again on April 19th.

40:30.887 --> 40:34.599
- You have a good memory.
- What was she like?

40:34.640 --> 40:36.516
Behind the camera.

40:39.394 --> 40:44.482
You two seemed to click.
Like you could've been something together.

40:44.523 --> 40:46.400
What about you?

40:49.319 --> 40:51.821
- Me and Sarah?
- Yeah.

40:51.863 --> 40:55.366
- You bought her flowers.
- We're both romantics.

40:55.408 --> 40:59.578
- Scratch the surface of a cynic...
- You wanted to be together?

40:59.620 --> 41:02.663
- Yes.
- You knew what she liked?

41:03.956 --> 41:09.586
I wanted her to be happy. Again.
Like before.

41:11.505 --> 41:14.549
You picked out the flowers yourself?

41:14.591 --> 41:20.596
Down in Chinatown. White roses.
She would've wanted that.

41:20.638 --> 41:26.017
And the box had a gold band.
She would've wanted that, too.

41:26.059 --> 41:30.646
- I left it out in front of her building.
- But you didn't leave?

41:30.687 --> 41:34.733
No. I wanted to see her smile.

41:35.691 --> 41:40.696
That moment,
when they open the florist's box...

41:40.738 --> 41:42.823
It's magic.

41:44.366 --> 41:46.868
Where were you when you set it off?

41:48.953 --> 41:50.329
The park.

41:51.705 --> 41:55.792
I watched the five o'clock news
on a portable television.

41:55.834 --> 42:01.922
I watched her come home and turn on
the lights like she always does,

42:01.964 --> 42:04.675
take the box up into her apartment.

42:04.716 --> 42:08.261
And then I waited for her smile.

42:12.098 --> 42:14.183
Did she?

42:15.517 --> 42:18.520
For a moment, yes.

42:18.562 --> 42:20.814
First time all night.

42:22.439 --> 42:27.194
She didn't... seem happy
when she signed off.

42:32.323 --> 42:36.118
'I'm Sarah Logan. Good night.'

42:38.912 --> 42:42.206
Do you know
what I'd always say back to her?

42:44.250 --> 42:46.377
'Good night, Sarah.'
