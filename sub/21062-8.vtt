Is that Tamar with him?

- [ thuds ]
- [ glass shatters ]

24:00.260 --> 24:02.569
- Vi!
- Aunt Vi?

24:02.610 --> 24:04.430
- Aunt Vi.
- You okay, chre?

24:04.480 --> 24:06.266
What happened?

24:06.310 --> 24:10.428
We're staring down
a loaded gun

24:10.490 --> 24:12.219
No refuge found...

24:12.270 --> 24:14.056
I'm gonna take
you to the hospital
to get you checked out.

24:14.100 --> 24:17.183
No, uh-uh, uh-uh.
I-- I've been--

24:17.230 --> 24:19.141
I've been running
around town all day.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.499
I-- I just hadn't
eaten enough.

24:21.540 --> 24:24.145
- I'm fine.
- Aunt Vi, listen
to Hollywood.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.713
Something could be
seriously wrong.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.808
Only thing wrong
with me is you.

24:27.850 --> 24:31.980
And your hard-headed brother
and your runaway sister.

24:32.030 --> 24:36.330
Work it out with Ralph Angel
and Nova, and I mean that.

24:36.380 --> 24:38.462
[ Hollywood sighs ]
You scared me.

24:45.870 --> 24:48.737
Thank you
for putting Tim
in his place.

24:48.790 --> 24:51.008
Tim?

24:51.050 --> 24:53.132
Sounds like you used to be
in the same place as Tim.

24:57.140 --> 25:00.268
I didn't know a soul
when I first started out,

25:00.320 --> 25:03.232
so I walked through
the doors open to me

25:03.280 --> 25:05.669
until I could choose

25:05.720 --> 25:07.585
where I really
wanted to be.

25:07.630 --> 25:10.929
I love our people.
Deeply.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.063
I would do anything for us,
so I don't apologize

25:14.120 --> 25:17.021
for playing the game
when I had to.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.459
I can't treat
people's lives as sport,

25:20.510 --> 25:22.978
as a game.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.940
People who say
they're trying
to save the world

25:25.000 --> 25:27.867
up in here
breaking bread with people
who want to destroy it.

25:29.260 --> 25:32.081
Nah, that's not me.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.951
You don't have to be anything
other than who you are.

25:35.010 --> 25:39.310
At least that's what my friend
at the end of the table says.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.874
She's connected
with a producer at CNN,

25:41.930 --> 25:44.182
and, Nova, she would love
to put in a word for you.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.664
I didn't come here
to audition.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.452
You don't care
about getting your work
to a larger audience?

25:49.500 --> 25:51.809
- Come on.
- It's not how I do things.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.193
Maybe it's how
you should do things.

25:55.850 --> 26:00.207
Nova, none of us
are beyond growing.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.568
My favorite
part of this program
are days like today.

26:11.610 --> 26:15.125
Today we have
three people
in this room

26:15.180 --> 26:17.910
who are celebrating
their sobriety birthday,

26:17.960 --> 26:20.520
and we're incredibly
proud of them.

26:20.570 --> 26:23.926
- Jojo's been clean
and sober 90 days.
- Woman: All right.

26:23.970 --> 26:27.667
Marlene:
And Kamau's been clean
and sober for SIX months.

26:27.710 --> 26:31.146
And Darla, at two years,
clean and sober.

- [ people cheering ]
- Marlene: Come on up here,
please.

26:37.590 --> 26:38.978
Thank you.

- [ Marlene chuckles ]
- [ cheering ]

26:53.130 --> 26:55.291
I'm guessing
you're the boyfriend.

26:55.350 --> 26:57.477
- I'm Marlene.
- Ralph Angel.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.001
- Darla's sponsor.
- Nice to meet you.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.563
I'm glad you could
make it today.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.396
This is really huge
for her.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.919
Yeah, I know.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.870
It's a lifelong thing.

27:08.930 --> 27:10.579
But you know that, right?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.620
Yeah,
I do know that.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.495
I hope you're good
for her.

27:18.850 --> 27:21.717
I hope you can
support her, 'cause...

27:21.770 --> 27:23.897
her battle's not over.

27:23.940 --> 27:27.728
If you don't think
you can do it,

27:27.770 --> 27:29.021
you should leave.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.294
I don't want her slipping
because you didn't--

27:34.340 --> 27:35.682
[ sighs ]

27:35.740 --> 27:37.549
because you couldn't be
what she needed.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.830
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.848
You know,
your job will help me
stay in a good place.

27:57.890 --> 27:59.619
I'm really grateful.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.063
Kamau:
Hey, Darla.

28:04.110 --> 28:05.281
We've gotta get
a picture.

28:05.330 --> 28:06.888
- All three of us.
- Okay.

28:09.900 --> 28:11.379
Your hair looks different.

28:13.730 --> 28:15.334
It's nice.

28:16.470 --> 28:17.812
Thanks.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.083
So, I-- I got
your messages.

28:23.130 --> 28:25.826
Yeah.
[ sighs ]

28:25.870 --> 28:28.919
I was wondering
if I'm still on
the payroll.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.428
I know how you feel
and I know what I said

28:31.490 --> 28:34.391
about doing
what I gotta do.

28:34.450 --> 28:38.011
I'm asking you
to at least give me
that payroll check

28:38.060 --> 28:41.018
so I could be good
with my parole.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.530
I wouldn't just drop you
like that, Ralph Angel.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.239
Yeah, well,
how am I supposed
to know that?

28:47.290 --> 28:48.803
You know
because you know.

28:48.850 --> 28:51.318
Because we're your sisters.
Nothing can change that.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.541
Yeah, ain't nobody
been talking to me.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.285
So, I didn't know.

28:59.340 --> 29:03.640
Look, I-- I don't have
any definitive answers
about the farm...

29:05.130 --> 29:07.598
but I'm not losing
my baby brother over it.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.734

29:12.350 --> 29:15.308
So, I was sitting across
from the devil himself.

29:16.970 --> 29:19.928
I thought better of DuBois
to be into people like that.

29:19.970 --> 29:22.052
Did he say you was?

29:22.100 --> 29:24.568
He told me
to hate the game,

29:24.630 --> 29:26.313
not the player.

29:26.370 --> 29:28.270
I swear, every time I think
I've found someone--

29:28.330 --> 29:30.321
Nova, hush.

29:30.370 --> 29:34.761
From everything you say
about that black man,
he's fine.

29:34.810 --> 29:36.721
Smart, successful, kind.

29:36.770 --> 29:39.409
Shoot, if I was
young and single,

29:39.470 --> 29:43.679
I'd break him in two
like a chocolate biscotti.

29:43.730 --> 29:48.121
- Aunt Vi.
- I'm just keeping it
real today.

29:48.170 --> 29:50.695
You're gonna walk away
from a good black man

29:50.740 --> 29:52.696
because of a party
you didn't like.

29:52.740 --> 29:56.301
- It's not that simple.
- No, you're what's simple.

29:56.350 --> 29:59.262
You were miserable
when you left here.

29:59.310 --> 30:01.005
Didn't tell nobody
where you was.

30:01.060 --> 30:05.531
But you were happy enough
to be with him, cooped up.

30:05.580 --> 30:08.538
Until you can find
something wrong with him.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.059
I don't know
what you mean.

30:10.110 --> 30:13.147
I mean you run away
from your problems at home.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.452
And then you find a problem
where you ran away to.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.760
Baby”.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.812
when you find something
good in this world,
you'd best hold on.

With love,

30:31.130 --> 30:32.950

Tomorrow ain't promised
to none of us.

have your block...

was blazing, I was ice-cold

- What?

Boy, you lock me
out of your room all day

31:06.640 --> 31:08.198
and that's
how you greet me?

31:08.250 --> 31:09.649
Don't you ever
talk to me like that.

31:09.690 --> 31:11.772
Turn that off.

- And sit your ass up.
- [ music stops ]

"Father Knows Best" now?

- You're a day late
and, like, $10 short.
- Oh, maybe.

- But I'm what you have
and I'm here.
- Okay.

for you to get back to you,

we're gonna do it.

at the restaurant
yesterday,

31:35.500 --> 31:36.888
that's not you.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.619
And, yeah, you can be
mad at me being on a date,

31:41.680 --> 31:44.979
although it did start off
as a marketing meeting,

31:45.030 --> 31:47.282
but you are not
going to embarrass me
and yourself like that.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.763
You understand me?

31:49.820 --> 31:51.333
I want you back.

31:51.380 --> 31:54.258
Well, I want
my family back.

that's mess up here
is because of you.

Okay? We had to leave home
because of what you did.

because of what you did.

The only reason
I got that damn car
I got pulled over in

of what you did.

And he told me
he was taking me in.

33:20.380 --> 33:22.382

to me, sort of.

that I was your son,

33:28.040 --> 33:30.122
but he didn't believe me.

33:30.180 --> 33:33.217
And then he drove past

Said we were
going for a ride.

33:39.490 --> 33:41.742
Yeah, that's when
he stopped being nice.

33:44.450 --> 33:48.841
Out of nowhere,
he said that he hated
fancy-talking niggers.

33:50.370 --> 33:52.065

that I sounded
like I grew up

33:52.110 --> 33:54.328
with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

33:59.730 --> 34:01.152
So...

34:02.860 --> 34:05.385
So we pull up
in an alley somewhere.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.344
And it's dark.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.251
And he gets out of the car
and he says--

34:13.310 --> 34:15.778
he says, "I'm gonna
take that silver spoon
out your mouth, boy."

34:15.830 --> 34:17.912
He kept saying that.
"I'm gonna take that spoon
out your mouth, boy.

Put something else
in it."

34:20.660 --> 34:22.355
So...
[ sobbing ]

34:24.580 --> 34:28.402
So, he gets out of the car,
he opens the door,

34:28.450 --> 34:32.580
he takes out his gun,
he pushes me down,

34:32.630 --> 34:34.803
and he puts the gun
in my mouth.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.662
I know, but we can
get the attention

36:40.720 --> 36:42.927
and the funding
the 9th Ward needs.

36:42.980 --> 36:45.141
No more skimpy
fundraisers for you,

36:45.200 --> 36:48.499
_ _ no more _
waiting on foundations
to deny grants for me.

36:48.550 --> 36:50.768
We can make a difference,
and we're going to use

36:50.810 --> 36:55.156
that closet racist's
own words to do it.

36:57.170 --> 36:59.855
You could have called.

36:59.910 --> 37:03.380
You didn't need to come
all the way to Louisiana.

37:03.430 --> 37:07.252
Honey,
I got the blues...

37:07.310 --> 37:09.824
I also needed
to see you.

37:09.870 --> 37:15.649
You got to see,
rid of that groove blue

37:15.710 --> 37:23.446
And see colors in places
you haven't before.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.058
Hey.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.938
Got your message.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.242
Hey.

37:36.290 --> 37:38.463
Thank you for coming by.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.682
I was looking for you
after the potluck.

37:43.730 --> 37:47.643
Wanted to say thanks
for helping me out
with the farmers.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.043
But you rushed out
pretty quickly.

37:50.090 --> 37:51.910
Yeah, I had to get
to a class.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.656
Remy, please,
talk to me.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.429
It's obvious
something's bothering you.

37:58.140 --> 37:59.744
[ sighs ]

37:59.790 --> 38:01.394
Okay, I lied.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.492
I read your interview
and I didn't like it.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.883
Why didn't you mention
your divorce?

38:07.930 --> 38:10.194
Micah...

38:10.240 --> 38:13.061
asset protection...

38:13.110 --> 38:16.841
but mostly because
one of the most important things

38:16.900 --> 38:20.813
a woman can control
is her own story.

38:20.860 --> 38:24.034
And I don't want
anyone trying to say
that you're my rebound guy.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.809
Come on, Charley.

38:25.860 --> 38:27.293
- Don't play with me.
- I'm not.

38:29.690 --> 38:32.602
I'm not calculating
with you.

38:34.220 --> 38:35.653
What's real is...

38:37.920 --> 38:39.308
is how I feel
about you.

38:46.540 --> 38:48.019
Don't you want
to be with me?

38:49.930 --> 38:54.321
- I don't know.
- Can you-- can you try?

38:57.290 --> 39:00.930
I'm asking you
to please forgive me
for treating you like this,

39:00.990 --> 39:03.117
like-- like--

39:03.160 --> 39:06.812
like this
between you and me

39:06.860 --> 39:08.248
is a given.

39:10.910 --> 39:13.299
And if you--
if you just try,

Hush, you don't
have to worry, no

Rush, though
the lines are blurry

39:57.260 --> 39:59.899
Just trust...

40:01.870 --> 40:03.656
What's all this?

40:05.620 --> 40:08.009
I wanted to do
something for you.

40:09.920 --> 40:13.003
I loved seeing you
up there today.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.278
Felt like
the first time we met.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.276
We've come a long way,
haven't we?

Thank you
for all of this.

Um, I don't want
to distract you

40:33.340 --> 40:36.468
from whatever you think
it'll take to stay
on the right foot.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.604
I just wanna
ride with you

40:40.650 --> 40:42.823
as long as you'll
let me do that.

40:44.610 --> 40:49.138
And I promise
I'll do my best

40:49.180 --> 40:52.092
and help you
do your best.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.131
Always.
