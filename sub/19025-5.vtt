00:01.800 --> 00:04.268
<i>As a doctor,</i>
<i>it's important to make small talk.</i>

00:04.360 --> 00:06.430
What would you like
with your sandwich?

00:06.520 --> 00:07.509
Pickles.

00:07.600 --> 00:11.070
<i>It's harder if your patient has dementia</i>
<i>and can only say one word.</i>

00:11.160 --> 00:13.151
- And to drink?
- Pickles.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.993
Now for a thousand dollars
and this bag of IV fluids,

00:16.079 --> 00:18.753
guaranteed to make you feel
like you're 190 again,

00:18.840 --> 00:21.115
what did Peter Piper pick a peck of?

00:21.200 --> 00:24.237
- Pickles.
- I'm sorry, Mr Bober.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.550
The correct answer is peppers.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.074
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

00:29.160 --> 00:33.631
Newbie. Did I just walk in
on you mocking an innocent patient?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.075
- Yes.
- I've never felt closer to you.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.357
This is just exactly what's wrong
with the whole system.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.149
The nursing home unload this gomer on us
because they can't treat him.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.596
So we get his temperature below 100
and then turf him right back

00:46.680 --> 00:51.117
to Next Stop Heaven, where between
wheelchair productions of <i>Anything Goes</i>

00:51.200 --> 00:54.397
and robbing the bastards blind,
they bounce him back to us.

00:54.480 --> 00:59.679
On the plus side, his temperature's
99.9, so sayonara, Mr Bober.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.912
I could just give you a hug.
Of course I never would.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.673
I could, but I never would.
God save me.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.880
<i>No biggie, because here comes</i>
<i>my dream girl with a smile just for me.</i>

01:14.360 --> 01:16.954
- You know what I love?
- What?

01:17.040 --> 01:19.713
My boyfriend, Sean.

01:19.800 --> 01:24.078
<i>That's when I made one of the biggest</i>
<i>mistakes I'd made in some time.</i>

01:24.920 --> 01:28.151
I'm bummed out about Elliot.
I just needed someone to talk to.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.912
<i>I called my brother.</i>

01:30.000 --> 01:32.150
Boo-frickin-hoo. I'm glad you called.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.916
Mom's getting remarried for the seventh
time. This is such a hassle for me.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.595
<i>I had reopened a door that I had</i>
<i>successfully closed years ago.</i>

01:42.520 --> 01:44.909
Yes, Dan, I got your 11 messages.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.118
Because you're my brother, I'm gonna
put this nicely. Leave me alone.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.556
- This Mom thing doesn't bother you?
- Yes, it's killing me.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.792
- So much so that I have to go.
- All right, buddy. I'll see you soon.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.515
- Real soon.
- Wait.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.357
- What's up, Dan?
- Christopher.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.715
- We have the makings of a dog pile.
- Don't.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.791
Sorry, dude. I gotta.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.393
I miss Sean.
This long-distance thing is killing me.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.790
- Are you having phone sex?
- Gross.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.871
Have you and Turk ever done it?

02:23.960 --> 02:27.111
Last year when he went home
for the holidays I gave him a call.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.397
Surprising how Turk's
11 -year-old nephew sounds like him,

02:30.480 --> 02:32.311
and how worldly he is.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.717
I'm not doing it here. That guy
next door listens to everything I say.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.789
I can hear you there breathing.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.077
You sick bastard.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.517
You just need to find a place
where you're not so self-conscious.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.998
Hi, sweetie. Are you naked?

02:56.080 --> 03:00.073
Imagine me taking off my shirt
and kissing down your neck.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.549
Can you hear me? Sean?

03:02.640 --> 03:07.430
Good. Now I'm at your chest
and my tongue starts to...

03:07.520 --> 03:13.117
Are you there? Good. Because now
I am licking your nipples all over.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.795
Your nipples. Nipples, Sean.
I'm licking your nipples.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.791
Look, Oliver.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.478
I don't care how close you are.
I'll call you later.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.196
We have to get my brother out of here.
He's driving me crazy.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.669
I did not just drop
a toothbrush in the toilet.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.990
- Was it blue?
- Yellow.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.312
Don't sweat it.
So, Mrs D's getting remarried, huh?

03:38.400 --> 03:41.756
To a total loser. This guy's
making me move out of Mom's attic.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.718
- The audacity.
- I know. But this is gonna be great.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.553
Like when I came down
to see you guys in med school.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.552
I hooked up with that slu <i>tty</i> chick
with the huge cans.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.710
- What was her name?
- Amy.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.395
- How do you remember stuff like that?
- She was my girlfriend.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.391
- You got her number?
- No.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

04:12.360 --> 04:14.715
Turk and I are working
on our harmonizing.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.314
A one, a two, a one, two, three.

04:21.399 --> 04:25.439
- Haunting.
- With you, we can take it on the road.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.792
- I love the theatre.
- Come to Papa.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.836
Don't put your skivvies in the freezer.
My Popsicles taste like fabric softener.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.230
I like my bad boys
to stay nice and cold.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.155
Make sure you're dry, otherwise you get
a "tongue on the flagpole" situation.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.992
Stimulating conversation.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.674
Why doesn't Mom's new husband
want you there?

04:59.760 --> 05:03.355
I'm worried, cos I think
this marriage might actually stick,

05:03.440 --> 05:05.795
unlike Mom and Dad,
who solved things with sex.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.189
- They did?
- Yeah.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.078
You were only born
cos Mom bounced a cheque.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.516
I guess you're only here
because Mom wrecked the car.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.556
No, they wanted me.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.113
My nephew just asked what you're wearing
today. How cute is that?

05:24.200 --> 05:26.111
Not as cute as you think.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.671
I've gotta scrape some cash together
to see Sean.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.796
OK, everyone, listen up.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.189
It came to my attention
that Dr Brogan here

05:35.280 --> 05:38.238
has been moonlighting
over at County Medical.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.470
If he were to kill someone there, great.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.950
But if he were to make a mistake here
because of how tired he was,

05:44.040 --> 05:45.951
then my hospital would be liable.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.352
So, Ted, why don't you tell everyone
what my policy on moonlighting is?

05:50.440 --> 05:52.158
No moonlighting.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.676
Dr Brogan will be suspended
without pay for one week,

05:55.760 --> 05:59.116
but he gets to run around in my backyard
wearing a foam suit

05:59.200 --> 06:02.715
so I can see if my dog Baxter's attack
classes were worth the money.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.473
- Is my message clear?
- Absolutely, sir.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.755
No moonlighting, sir.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.799
- Where do you moonlight?
- Insurance physicals.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.030
- Free clinic.
- Mammogram-mobile.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.398
I just got the offer. But I'd make more
money than I do now in an ambulance.

06:19.480 --> 06:24.156
Even though I'll be handling breasts,
my beautiful fiancÃ©e would let me...

06:25.520 --> 06:28.637
...ride around in an ambulance.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.628
<i>Dan wanted to come to work today,</i>
<i>but I said it'd make me uncomfortable.</i>

06:34.720 --> 06:36.119
<i>He was OK with it.</i>

06:36.200 --> 06:40.159
I heard there's a bed in the on-call
room. Ever get hot and heavy in there?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.913
- Usually I'm in there by myself.
- So yes.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.468
My buddy Wayne
lives a couple of miles upstate.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.516
He's got a new bumper-pool table.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.433
- I'm gonna be taking off tonight.
- Thank God. Dr Cox.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.432
- You remember my brother Dan?
- What do you say, Coxy?

06:54.040 --> 06:55.951
- Nothing.
- That's a first.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.235
- This is my boss.
- You know what a boss is?

06:58.320 --> 07:03.269
For you, that would be the 17-year-old
that tells you to fill all the ketchups.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.069
- My ribs.
- Why don't you get a snack cake?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.516
Dan was wondering
if he could trail with us today.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.752
Good God, there are just so very many
ways for me to say this to you.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.308
Never, not in a million years,
absolutely not,

07:17.400 --> 07:20.278
no way Jose, no chance Lance,
nyet, negatory.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.313
And my own personal favourite of
all time, man falling off a cliff.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.273
- I just wanna say thank you.
- Hold the phone.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.794
You don't want him to come with us?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.714
Dan. Come.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.074
Thanks. I didn't get
that mammogram-mobile job.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.435
- They said you took it after all.
- What?

07:56.520 --> 07:59.114
Yes, I took it. But it pays better.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.954
This job is about helping women detect
breast cancer and nothing more.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.669
If you'll excuse me, I'm late for work.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.832
Have fun, cos you'll never
see the girls again.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.556
The place where I moonlight
pays pre <i>tty</i> well. I can call them.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.517
Cool. What's the gig?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.670
It's just emergency patch and fix work.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.389
It's no different than
treating a patient at our hospital.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.756
Looky here. Tell me, sir.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.230
What brings Dr Dorian's
favourite gomer back to the hospital?

08:35.320 --> 08:36.957
- Pickles.
- Fair enough.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.155
What's a gomer?

08:38.240 --> 08:42.916
An old person that takes up a room and
doesn't have the common decency to die.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.673
That's just rude is what that is.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.671
I don't have time for pickles.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.832
I've got a drug addict
who'll say things will be different,

08:50.920 --> 08:52.797
then try and take my watch again.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.715
Dammit. Can't we just put a pillow over
his head and put him out of his misery?

08:57.800 --> 09:03.158
Not gonna be necessary. His
temperature's below 100. Take him away.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.239
How long has my little brother
had the desire to smother old people?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.878
I should warn Grandma.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.270
Sounds dark, but you gotta deal
with this place any way you can.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.511
- These are living, breathing people.
- I'm sorry.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.511
- What do you do?
- I tend bar.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.639
I'm gonna go ahead and worry about
how we do things around here,

09:26.720 --> 09:30.190
but if I ever do need to find out
how to make a top-notch rum and coke,

09:30.280 --> 09:35.479
by gum, mister, you had better be by the
phone, cos I might give you a jingle.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.709
Hi, Dan. Coxaroonie.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.554
Regarding the rum and coke issue,
couldn't be more confused.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.554
We have another dog coming in. Do you
want him or the four cats next door?

09:48.640 --> 09:51.552
The dog.
I don't know why, but all cats hate me.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.791
If I ever make eye contact with them,
they freak out.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.311
Well, well, well.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.673
Stop it, ki <i>tty</i>. Get off me.
Not my pants.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.397
You all suck.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.591
Hi, sir.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.789
Well, Dan, what can I say?
It's been three days.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.110
- Two days.
- Feels like three.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.397
Say hi to Wayne and good luck
in the bumper-pool tournament.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.358
- Actually, I don't think I'm leaving.
- Why?

10:30.440 --> 10:34.718
I'm worried about you. Hanging
with you today and watching you work,

10:34.800 --> 10:38.031
the gomer talk and all the attitude,
I'm not sure I like it.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.317
- It's definitely not my little brother.
- You know what?

10:41.400 --> 10:45.279
Once Dad left and Mom started marrying
everyone that rang the doorbell,

10:45.360 --> 10:48.158
someone said how lucky I was
to have an older brother.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.199
But you never came through
for me once, did you?

10:52.280 --> 10:55.158
I'm in love with a girl
who's in love with someone else

10:55.240 --> 10:58.073
and you responded by drinking
my Baileys Irish Cream

10:58.160 --> 11:00.071
and whining about Mom's boyfriend.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.958
You are a self-involved user,

11:03.040 --> 11:06.112
and you wanna tell me
what kind of person to be?

11:06.200 --> 11:09.397
Instead, why don't you just
get the hell out of my life?

11:09.480 --> 11:13.678
But we're brothers.
That counts for something, right?

11:14.360 --> 11:15.793
Not to me.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.630
<i>Whenever there's an argument in my</i>
<i>family, we pretend nothing happened.</i>

11:37.360 --> 11:40.352
- How are your chocolate chip flapjacks?
- Good.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.079
- More whipped cream, Christopher?
- Bring it.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.355
It's been great hanging with you.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.830
Johnny, I know I don't say this
nearly enough, but...

11:52.880 --> 11:55.440
Coffee's kicking in.
Back in four minutes.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.033
I cannot afford to be suspended
right now.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.715
- I'll have to resort to blackmail.
- How we gonna blackmail Kelso?

12:02.800 --> 12:06.349
Unless you take the fall, I tell Turk
you're sleeping with someone.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.715
Relax. I have a secret weapon.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.236
You saw nothing.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.755
Thanks for loaning me this shirt.
I got compliments from the sisters.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.271
Sharon called me a cracker.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.999
How many times I gotta tell you?
Cracker: Bad.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.356
Why aren't you apologising
to your brother before he leaves?

12:27.440 --> 12:30.398
You don't get it, man.
Your family was there for you.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.598
Kids of divorce swear they have the
market cornered on family dysfunction.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.911
Let me share a typical Thanksgiving
at the Turk household.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.833
Mom yells at my sister
for yelling at my grandmother,

12:40.920 --> 12:43.434
who's yelling at the TV,
which is the microwave.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.875
My militant brother Jabari,
formerly Bob,

12:45.960 --> 12:49.748
gives Dad attitude for using the word
"black", referring to the turkey,

12:49.840 --> 12:52.638
which got burnt when
instead of turning the oven off,

12:52.720 --> 12:56.156
my bipolar Aunt Leslie
tried to shove her head in it.

12:56.240 --> 13:01.519
But we kiss and we hug and we apologise
for all the things we said,

13:01.600 --> 13:05.434
cos a month later we're gonna get
together and do it again at Christmas.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.512
Now check the ball, cracker.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.711
One nothing.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.239
You're home now.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.790
I paged Dr Kelso.
Do you feel confident about this, Ted?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.599
I'm not sure.
I don't know how confidence feels.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.798
Afternoon, suspendees, Ted.
Guess who's back from the vet?

13:27.880 --> 13:30.394
One, two, three. What a boy.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.350
Sir, about Nurse Espinoza
and Dr Reid's suspensions,

13:35.440 --> 13:38.910
there aren't any grounds
to punish them for moonlighting.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.594
They weren't working with people,
just animals.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.468
Just animals? Please, this dog
is smarter than most people.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.632
- He's definitely smarter than you.
- Sir, I don't think...

13:48.720 --> 13:50.915
Baxter, sit.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.560
Ted, sit.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.791
- Ted, you don't have to.
- Shut up. I can win this.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.110
Baxter, speak.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.794
- Ted, speak.
- Hello.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.599
Baxter, left foot.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.750
Ted, left hand.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.434
- Left hand, Ted.
- Hello.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.397
Baxter wins.
He gets the desk. Baxter, go up.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.234
Those are definitely broken.
Why did you do that?

14:24.080 --> 14:26.435
- Gee, I don't know.
- Who are you?

14:26.520 --> 14:29.512
- I'm waiting for my brother.
- Isn't that perfect?

14:29.600 --> 14:32.353
You send your brother in
to do the dirty work, huh?

14:32.440 --> 14:37.878
And with an open fly, no less.
Made you look. A twofer.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.394
- Emergency room?
- That way.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.356
- So you taking off?
- Yeah.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.558
I wanna apologise for everything I said.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.552
- I really like having you around.
- No, you don't.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.189
I know. I have dreams where I staple
your fingers to your face.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.034
But you're my brother. You can crash
at my place as long as you like.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.556
That's OK.
I'll see you back home at Christmas.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.557
- Why are you here?
- My boyfriend is in New Zealand.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.029
If I don't moonlight,
I'm never gonna see him.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.715
My wedding's costing twice as much
as I thought, and I need the cash.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.394
Baxter won't get out of my chair.

15:23.480 --> 15:27.189
Even though
we're understaffed and underpaid,

15:27.280 --> 15:29.430
I've been working here for ten years.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.990
All day long, all I hear is,
"Carla, Carla, Carla."

15:38.200 --> 15:40.111
Sir, what Carla is saying,

15:40.200 --> 15:44.193
and not in any kind of crazy
or rambling sort of way,

15:44.280 --> 15:47.511
is we work hard here, but it's not
the only thing in our lives.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.798
You know what it's like to love someone
so much, you'd do anything you had to?

15:53.640 --> 15:55.790
I'll see you two in the morning.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.474
Get out of my office
before I change my mind.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.756
Darling, I wanna say something.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.877
For 25 years,
we've been going through the motions.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.953
Once every few weeks we have sex, and
then breakfast without saying a word.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.838
Tonight I want you
to put on a nice dress.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.878
I'm gonna take you to dinner
and start telling you

16:19.960 --> 16:23.794
all the things I haven't taken the time
to say all these years.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.397
I love you, too.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.035
That was beautiful, sir.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.715
Thanks, Ted. Call my wife.
Tell her I won't be home tonight.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.151
Here I'd been told you left.
It made me happy.

16:46.240 --> 16:50.279
You don't like me. People don't like me.
You know why? I'm a screw-up.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.635
Always have been.
Ever since we were kids.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.393
I had to walk Johnny to school
first day every year.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.473
Every year I'd walk him
to the wrong school. Just cos.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.835
Boy, that's a great story. Really.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.957
And I'm sure you were
a horrible big brother.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.952
But you have me confused
with somebody who gives a crap.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.077
You don't need to be embarrassed.
It happens all the time.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.948
For instance, my father actually made
the same mistake on his deathbed.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.190
Listen, no offence.

17:17.280 --> 17:21.068
I'm a big fan of the tough-guy act,
but let me tell you what I really think.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.117
You love it that these kids idolise you.
Johnny does.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.271
Johnny was always the one
we knew was going someplace.

17:27.359 --> 17:31.751
Sweet kid. Smart kid. Becoming a doctor,
this is all he ever wanted.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.912
Yet somehow you've found a way
to beat that out of him.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.118
Turned him into some kind of cynical
guy who seems to despise what he does.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.359
Johnny's never gonna look up to me.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.113
Ever. But he hangs on your every word.

17:48.200 --> 17:53.149
So I'm asking, I'm telling you,
take that responsibility seriously,

17:53.240 --> 17:56.152
otherwise you're gonna have to
answer to me.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.879
<i>Love can give you strength</i>
<i>you never knew you had.</i>

18:00.600 --> 18:03.239
It was good seeing you, Dr Cox.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.231
Good to see you, Dan.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.468
All the best.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.711
<i>Love can also give you courage.</i>

18:17.800 --> 18:20.758
Lots of cats today.
What's wrong with this guy?

18:20.840 --> 18:24.833
I think he's got something stuck
behind his big sharp tooth.

18:28.760 --> 18:32.833
<i>It's enough to love my brother, even</i>
<i>though he'll never come up big for me.</i>

18:32.920 --> 18:35.388
Mr Pickles, welcome back.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.119
Here we go with this guy again.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.273
Still, it sure is nice
to be doing something you love.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.193
I wouldn't trade it. What about you?

18:46.560 --> 18:49.154
- No.
- Don't forget that.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.115
- Pickles.
- Damn right, sir.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.752
Damn right.
