03:25.914 --> 03:27.905
We've done the same
with one of these peel-off stickers,

03:27.957 --> 03:29.538
it goes right on the file folder.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.460
Now, each file folder needs to go
into its own Pendaflex folder.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.288
You have to make sure
it's the appropriate Pendaflex folder.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.841
Why does it have to be on the inside
folder and the outside folder?

03:40.553 --> 03:42.259
-The case number?
-Yes.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.804
(SNICKERS) Because it's the key
to the entire system.

03:45.266 --> 03:49.384
It also goes on the report. All pages.
You punch it with a two-hole punch.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.471

on this two-prong fastener.

The dog was guardin' the body.
They had to wrestle him inside.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.829
-Ah, did you talk to anybody?
-Nobody heard or saw anything.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.838

18:20.516 --> 18:22.427
I moved here to get away
from murder scenes.

Come on, every little speck of dirt
is not evidence.

19:46.768 --> 19:50.306
What are you going to do, Turner?
Put the entire pier in a little baggie?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.807
What is that for?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.855
To preserve what's ever underneath
the fingernails.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.155

on your police force,

20:50.374 --> 20:52.990

is stolen mailboxes?

that he was a witness to the, uh, crime.

I want to encourage you

It's a wonderful town to raise kids in.

47:26.760 --> 47:30.173
-Well, I don't have kids.
-Well, lwant five kids.

47:30.264 --> 47:33.756
How about a dad? Have you got a dad
picked out for these five kids?

47:33.809 --> 47:35.299
-No. Not yet.
-No?

47:35.394 --> 47:37.976
Well, let me fill you in
on the Cypress Beach singles scene.

but I usually arrest guys my age who
are hanging out at the Dairy Queen.

47:51.368 --> 47:54.860

you want to have those five kids, so...

I'm just going to like you even more.

1:01:15.213 --> 1:01:19.126
two shifts of our own guys,
plus all sorts of local cops.

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:23.464
This is gonna be the biggest search
in the central coast since what?

1:01:23.554 --> 1:01:26.045
Since probably World War II,
and it's all because of you.

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:29.011
We're gonna go through Boyett's
like bacon through a duck

1:01:29.102 --> 1:01:31.935
and bust us a smuggling operation.

1:01:32.230 --> 1:01:33.390
This is dessert.

1:01:33.439 --> 1:01:35.976
Chocolate chip cookies.
Chocolate chip.

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:38.642
Something to drink?

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:40.442
It's not gonna hurt me at all

1:01:40.530 --> 1:01:42.566
if we impress
some of those C.H.P. guys.

1:01:42.865 --> 1:01:44.776
That's gonna look good on the resume.

1:01:45.118 --> 1:01:47.484
Give me maybe a little
job security in the future.

1:01:47.578 --> 1:01:48.954
Nothin' wrong with that.

1:01:49.163 --> 1:01:50.619
There you go.

1:01:51.582 --> 1:01:53.322
Well, come on, you're not eating.
Go ahead.

1:01:55.002 --> 1:01:56.833
Go ahead. This is a celebration, Hooch.

1:01:56.921 --> 1:02:01.164
You I.D.'d Zack Gregory.
Amos's murder is all but solved.

1:02:01.884 --> 1:02:03.499
So go.

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:05.885
-Open your beer.
-(SNIFFING)

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.175
What? You're thinking about Amos?

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:14.802
Huh? You must miss him.

1:02:16.149 --> 1:02:17.514
Yeah, well,

1:02:19.527 --> 1:02:21.984
I forget sometimes that this
must be pretty hard on you.

1:02:22.071 --> 1:02:23.447
Everything's so different.

1:02:24.282 --> 1:02:25.738
You and I got off to a pretty bad start,

1:02:25.825 --> 1:02:30.034
and my place isn't exactly
a rusty shack filled with junk.

1:02:31.414 --> 1:02:33.905
Not yet, anyway.
You can keep working on it.

1:02:35.793 --> 1:02:37.033
Okay?

1:02:38.671 --> 1:02:39.831
Hmm?

1:02:41.716 --> 1:02:43.297
-You like that?
-(GRUNTS)

1:02:43.843 --> 1:02:45.333
You like that?

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:47.506
(GRUNTS)

1:02:48.473 --> 1:02:50.759
You do! You like that.

1:02:50.850 --> 1:02:53.136
Well, here, let me do this side as well.

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:55.267
Huh? Huh?

1:02:55.897 --> 1:02:57.683
You're not so rough.

1:02:58.024 --> 1:03:00.140
-You're not so mean.
-(GROWLING)

1:03:00.526 --> 1:03:03.859
You're not any kind of a monster dog,
are ya?

1:03:03.946 --> 1:03:05.482
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1:03:05.531 --> 1:03:09.069
Look at those big teeth.
What are you doing?

1:03:09.243 --> 1:03:11.700
Give me back my towel. Give it to me.

1:03:12.872 --> 1:03:15.204
(BOTH GROWLING)

1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:21.046
-All right then! Come on!
-(BARKING)

1:03:21.214 --> 1:03:22.829
Come on! Come get this thing!

1:03:22.924 --> 1:03:24.380
Get it! Ha! Ha-ha!

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:25.877
I got it!

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:29.548
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1:03:30.515 --> 1:03:31.880
You're on the couch.

1:03:49.909 --> 1:03:51.991
Well, if any of my employees
are involved in anything illegal,

1:03:52.078 --> 1:03:54.239
I'm happy to cooperate.
I just don't understand it.

1:03:54.288 --> 1:03:55.698
When was the last time
you saw Zack Gregory?

1:03:56.165 --> 1:03:58.872
Yesterday at the wedding.
He didn't show up for work last night.

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:00.829
Well, the Monterey police
checked out his address.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.330
It was a motel,
and they'd never heard of him.

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:05.750
He shows up for his paycheck,
I'll call you.

1:04:09.804 --> 1:04:11.590
All right, let's go, guys! Come on!

1:04:12.265 --> 1:04:14.301
I don't want any of
the sheriff's department guys

1:04:14.392 --> 1:04:15.552
handling this stuff alone.

1:04:15.601 --> 1:04:17.808
Let's make sure one of our guys
is with them all the way.

1:04:20.439 --> 1:04:22.930
-Gee, I hate fish.
-(CHATTERING)

1:04:25.319 --> 1:04:27.435
Okay, let's check in the back.

1:04:27.822 --> 1:04:29.778
(CHATTERING CONTINUES)

1:04:47.633 --> 1:04:51.467
Move these filing cabinets out,
then go through these one by one.

1:04:51.804 --> 1:04:53.260
(CHATTERING CONTINUES)

1:05:08.321 --> 1:05:09.606
Maybe we came on the wrong day.

1:05:09.655 --> 1:05:12.146
Howard, I apologize. I'm sorry.

1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:14.406
I really let you down.

1:05:14.493 --> 1:05:16.324
Come on, forget it.

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:19.324
Can't expect things
to pan out every time, can you?

1:05:19.498 --> 1:05:21.113
Besides, you got a newjob
waiting for you.

1:05:21.834 --> 1:05:24.041
Why don't you go home
and pack up and get ready?

1:05:24.128 --> 1:05:27.495
David, the case is now yours.

1:05:28.591 --> 1:05:31.003
(INDISTINCT CHATTER
ON POLICE RADIO)

1:05:36.057 --> 1:05:38.013
Foster, the guys in Monterey told me

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:40.182
you sheriffs did the initial
go-see on Zack Gregory,

1:05:40.227 --> 1:05:42.889
but the D.M.V. says they sent
his vehicle registration

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:45.517
on the black Cadillac
to the Lazy Acres motel.

1:05:45.566 --> 1:05:46.681
So I'm just trying to determine

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:49.771
how you discovered
that it was a false address.

1:05:49.862 --> 1:05:51.978
What did you do,
just call them up on the phone?

1:05:53.783 --> 1:05:55.193
You didn't even go down
for an interview?

1:05:55.284 --> 1:05:57.024
You didn't show them a photo?

1:05:58.663 --> 1:06:01.905
Well, all right, look.
I need surveillance done

1:06:01.999 --> 1:06:05.036
on the Lazy Acres motel
to locate Zack Gregory.

1:06:05.127 --> 1:06:09.120
Yes, he's the prime suspect
in the Amos Reed murder, that's why.

1:06:09.590 --> 1:06:11.672
Yes, he is, he is legitimate.

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:13.548
l have an eyewitness, kind of.

1:06:14.011 --> 1:06:16.218
I am not telling you how to do yourjob.

1:06:16.263 --> 1:06:19.630
I am a law enforcement officer,
and you are too, kind of,

1:06:19.725 --> 1:06:21.807
and I'm asking you
for a professional courtesy.

1:06:21.894 --> 1:06:23.259
Don't hang up on me!

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:27.524
What a dumb cop.

1:06:41.288 --> 1:06:43.574
SCOTT: ltjust keeps clicking around
inside my brain,

1:06:43.624 --> 1:06:46.081
what Amos told me about that place,
that there's something going on.

1:06:46.168 --> 1:06:47.908
I don't know. I can't figure it out,

1:06:47.962 --> 1:06:49.122
and I can't stop thinking about it.

1:06:49.213 --> 1:06:50.623
Maybe you should.

1:06:50.798 --> 1:06:52.413
-(SIGHS) No.
-Stop thinking about it.

1:06:52.633 --> 1:06:56.296
Well, when I have a problem
that I can't get anywhere with,

1:06:56.387 --> 1:07:00.756
sometimes I just think of
something completely different,

1:07:00.808 --> 1:07:04.517
and then that's when a solution comes,
bang, just like that, out of nowhere.

1:07:04.895 --> 1:07:06.510
-Well, that's fascinating.
-(LAUGHS)

1:07:06.647 --> 1:07:08.262
I don't work that way, all right?

1:07:08.315 --> 1:07:10.567
-Well, try.
-Well, no, I can't.

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:13.442
-I don't know how.
-Well, I'll help.

1:07:13.529 --> 1:07:15.440
-I'm thinking about something else.
-(GROANS)

1:07:15.531 --> 1:07:17.112
-What am I thinking about?
-Oh, don't.

1:07:17.158 --> 1:07:19.114
-lndulge me.
-Don't, don't, don't even...

1:07:19.201 --> 1:07:21.237
I don't know what you're thinking about.

1:07:21.287 --> 1:07:22.652
Great.

1:07:23.122 --> 1:07:24.953
So you've never thought about it?

1:07:25.541 --> 1:07:27.281
Never thought about what?

1:07:30.296 --> 1:07:33.413
Oh, oh, oh...
Thought about that. Well...

1:07:33.466 --> 1:07:35.582
-Well.
-Yes, I'm a guy, yes.

1:07:35.634 --> 1:07:37.010
Yeah, I've thought about that.

1:07:37.136 --> 1:07:38.216
How far did you get?

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:39.794
Well, you know,

1:07:39.889 --> 1:07:46.260
I got to unbutton the top button
of your blouse.

1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:49.595
I got a lot farther than that.

1:07:51.317 --> 1:07:53.057
-You did?
-Mmm-hmm.

1:07:53.152 --> 1:07:55.518
How far? A lot farther?

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:57.145
A lot farther.

1:08:01.577 --> 1:08:03.488
Well, you have to use your imagination.

1:08:04.914 --> 1:08:08.156
-Well, then that's got to be illegal.
-Probably is.

1:08:29.355 --> 1:08:31.471
-Ew! Right from the carton?
-Mmm.

1:08:31.524 --> 1:08:34.857
Oh, God! A woman in my house.
How'd that happen?

1:08:37.446 --> 1:08:38.686
Hey, how's your back?

1:08:38.781 --> 1:08:41.773
Well, it's regained some of its elasticity,
I'd say.

1:08:41.867 --> 1:08:43.368
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHS)

1:08:43.410 --> 1:08:45.196
-Well, this thing is empty.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:08:45.246 --> 1:08:46.736
What are we gonna do about it?

1:08:46.831 --> 1:08:50.415
Well, most of my grocery budget's
been blown on my dog,

1:08:50.501 --> 1:08:53.208
-but we could manage...
-Those eggs?

1:08:53.295 --> 1:08:56.207
-Perfect omelet.
-Oh, that's great. Go to it.

1:08:57.591 --> 1:08:59.627
Well, um...

-No. No, no, no. No, no, no.
-(LAUGHS)

1:09:02.221 --> 1:09:04.177
No, Ithink "we"
was the operative word there.

1:09:04.223 --> 1:09:06.054
-No. Oh, geez!
-Oh, well!

1:09:06.100 --> 1:09:09.342
-Oh! You look very lovely in the light.
-I don't do this.

-We have cheese.
-Oh, come on.

-l'll mess up your kitchen.
-I'm not gonna cook for you, woman...

-'Cause you wore me out.
-Did I?

1:09:21.323 --> 1:09:23.029
We could call for pizza.

1:09:23.075 --> 1:09:25.361
Don't. Don't.
I'll walk you through this, doctor.

1:09:25.411 --> 1:09:26.992
That's an omelet pan right above you.

1:09:27.079 --> 1:09:29.570
Aw, geez. You have a pan
just for your omelets?

1:09:29.665 --> 1:09:31.826
There's a whisk and... (KISS)

-Come on. I'm doing it.

I'd like to eat some time
in the next five hours.

-|s this happening?
-There you go, and great.

1:09:49.393 --> 1:09:53.511
Now, mix that up
and then we'll throw in the other stuff.

-No, that's stirring.

1:09:56.108 --> 1:09:58.895
This is how you mix.
This is how you mix.

Oh, my God. Do that again, would you?

-You like that?
-(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah.

1:10:10.456 --> 1:10:13.072
You feel so... Feel so good.

-Oh, Jesus, of course!

Oh! They're not bringing something in!

1:10:35.147 --> 1:10:36.648
Oh! The thing!

1:10:36.690 --> 1:10:38.851
-The thing that I wasn't thinking of it!
-Oh, the thought.

1:10:38.943 --> 1:10:40.854
-Yes! Bang!
-Oh. I told you...

1:10:40.945 --> 1:10:42.901
Hits me right...
That's never happened to me.

1:10:42.988 --> 1:10:45.104
I gotta get another look
inside that place.

1:10:45.157 --> 1:10:47.864
-They're smuggling something out!
-Why did I open my mouth?

1:10:47.952 --> 1:10:49.863
So does this mean I'll be eating alone?

1:10:49.954 --> 1:10:52.491
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but yeah.

1:10:52.581 --> 1:10:55.038
I'll tell you what.
I'll make it up to you tomorrow night.

1:10:55.125 --> 1:10:57.867
Have you ever been down to that
Italian place down in San Rapello?

1:10:57.962 --> 1:10:59.327
They make a lasagna down there.

1:10:59.421 --> 1:11:02.254
It's not a great lasagna,
but it is a good lasagna.

1:11:02.341 --> 1:11:05.083
I make better, but do you want...
You want to go tomorrow night?

1:11:05.844 --> 1:11:08.335
So, you're gonna be here
another night?

1:11:09.556 --> 1:11:11.512

-Well...

-With Camille.
-Listen. Would you clean this stuff up?

1:11:25.489 --> 1:11:27.571
When you're done? All right?

1:11:27.658 --> 1:11:29.944
Just... Leave it. Never mind.

1:11:30.035 --> 1:11:31.571

-7:00.

two-dimensional. You couldn't see it.

It was these chimps,
and they were supposed to be spies,

in suits and stuff, and they'd wear hats,

Are you aware of your

-Where is everybody?
-Huh? Oh, yeah.

1:24:24.976 --> 1:24:28.218
I got four cars out on Carpenter Road.
They're ready any time I signal them.

Hey. The engine of this forklift
is still warm.

1:24:58.843 --> 1:25:00.799
So it looks like we just missed 'em.

1:25:00.845 --> 1:25:02.836
Because you tipped 'em off,
didn't you, Howard?

1:25:02.889 --> 1:25:04.425
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1:25:04.516 --> 1:25:06.632

you better call 'em in.

It's just a matter of who's
gonna sell you out first,

1:28:21.546 --> 1:28:24.288
But obviously this is
going to be a lot easier to explain

1:28:24.382 --> 1:28:26.543
if we both have the same story.

1:28:27.552 --> 1:28:28.632
What?

1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:30.676

to question him and he fired at us.

1:28:30.722 --> 1:28:34.681
He killed your dog.
We fired back. Killed the suspect.

1:28:34.726 --> 1:28:37.342
Congratulations. You solved the case.

You know, I met some people
when lwas in the army in Panama,

1:28:42.483 --> 1:28:45.099
and they needed a secure way to
get cash out of the country,

1:28:45.236 --> 1:28:48.399
so Walt set it up, and I got one percent.

-I don't know that.

people are getting killed over this thing.

-HOWARD: ljust covered.

Boyett told him to do it.
