WEBVTT

01:01.811 --> 01:05.147
VISERYS: This world wasn't always
so small and petty.

01:05.982 --> 01:10.277
Thousands of years ago,
while the rest of men prayed to gods,

01:10.361 --> 01:12.404
the Valyrians became them.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.616
Through magic or sheer will,

01:15.700 --> 01:19.369
they mastered
the greatest creatures in history.

01:19.829 --> 01:24.833
A horse grants man dominion over the land,
a ship, over the sea.

01:25.168 --> 01:31.507
But dragons gave us the sky,
and everything, and everyone beneath it.

01:33.051 --> 01:37.054
At its height,
my ancestors ruled the known world.

01:37.305 --> 01:40.182
Whatever parts we didn't
weren't worth knowing.

01:40.892 --> 01:45.437
Our capital of Valyria
shamed the magnificent cities of the east,

01:45.522 --> 01:50.359
for hammers and chisels were no match
for dragonfire and sorcery.

01:51.152 --> 01:56.490
It was a city and an empire
built to last until the end of time.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.326
It didn't.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.747
Four hundred years ago,
the Doom fell on Valyria.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.749
Mountains cracked open like eggs.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.626
Lakes and rivers boiled.

02:07.710 --> 02:11.547
Fountains of fire, ash and smoke
spewed from the ground,

02:11.631 --> 02:16.844
so high and so hot
that even dragons burned in flight.

02:17.637 --> 02:22.015
The land splintered,
and the angry sea rushed in.

02:22.100 --> 02:27.479
In hours, the greatest city in history
became history.

02:28.398 --> 02:33.235
But my ancestors didn't burn or drown
with the rest of their race.

02:33.319 --> 02:38.157
Twelve years before the Doom,
despite the sneers of his rivals,

02:38.241 --> 02:42.286
Aenar Targaryen
abandoned the capital with his family.

02:42.996 --> 02:48.041
Legends claim that his daughter foresaw
the destruction of the city in a dream.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.378
More likely, Aenar met with
some mishap at court

02:51.462 --> 02:54.131
and chose exile over execution.

02:54.716 --> 03:00.721
He and House Targaryen slinked away
to a dreary, remote, godforsaken island.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.599
Forsaken no longer.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.519
With arts now lost to the world,

03:07.604 --> 03:11.440
we transformed a tiny outpost
into Dragonstone,

03:11.691 --> 03:14.526
a fortress fit for the last dragonlords.

03:15.528 --> 03:20.407
Then Aenar's descendants settled into it
like a tomb for their lost homeland.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.327
Until Aegon.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.704
When he looked east,

03:25.788 --> 03:29.791
he saw the past, old, tired, dead.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.544
But when he looked west,

03:33.129 --> 03:35.088
he saw the future,

03:35.173 --> 03:38.926
gold in the ground, gold in the fields,

03:39.010 --> 03:42.012
and no dragons in the sky but his.

03:42.680 --> 03:47.309
He and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya
flew over the great continent,

03:47.393 --> 03:50.395
ostensibly visitors to a strange land.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.898
But when Aegon returned,

03:52.982 --> 03:58.028
he ordered construction of a massive table
carved in the shape of Westeros,

03:58.112 --> 04:01.281
with all the notable rivers and mountains
that they had seen.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.244
A personal map of the Seven Kingdoms,

04:05.328 --> 04:09.498
then ruled by seven squabbling families.

04:09.999 --> 04:14.670
House Durrandon held the Stormlands
from their seat at Storm's End,

04:14.754 --> 04:17.089
due south of Dragonstone.

04:17.173 --> 04:22.094
House Hoare of the Iron Islands had
also conquered and enslaved the Riverlands,

04:22.178 --> 04:24.096
and ruled them from Harrenhal,

04:24.180 --> 04:27.975
a monstrous castle
rising on the shore of the Gods Eye.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.937
House Stark held the frozen
wasteland of the North,

04:32.021 --> 04:35.107
the oldest, largest
and emptiest of the kingdoms.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.693
House Lannister held the Westerlands,

04:37.777 --> 04:41.154
the wealthiest kingdom,
thanks to their gold mines.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.699
House Gardener held the Reach,

04:43.783 --> 04:46.827
the second wealthiest kingdom,
thanks to their crops.

04:47.245 --> 04:51.290
House Arryn held the Vale,
or rather the Vale held them.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.334
The mountains were impassable
except through the Bloody Gate,

04:54.419 --> 04:56.253
which had never been taken.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.923
House Martell held the deserts of Dorne,

05:00.008 --> 05:02.676
probably because no one else wanted them.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.887
Together, the Seven Kingdoms
made Westeros,

05:05.972 --> 05:07.973
a realm that wasn't yet a realm,

05:08.057 --> 05:12.561
ruled by great families
who didn't know what greatness was.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.229
Aegon would teach them.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.201
VARYS: Though House Durrandon
titled themselves "Storm Kings,"

05:28.286 --> 05:30.454
they were little more than gusts.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.582
Their kingdom in the Stormlands
had been doddering to its end

05:33.666 --> 05:35.167
for the past few centuries,

05:35.251 --> 05:37.336
helped along by other houses,

05:37.420 --> 05:39.338
most of all by House Hoare,

05:39.422 --> 05:42.424
who were nearly finished
with the monstrous castle of Harrenhal,

05:43.009 --> 05:47.012
too large and too costly a seat to rule
only the Riverlands.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.391
King Argilac knew
where the ironborn would soon turn.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.352
You'd think a king who
wanted to keep his crown

05:53.436 --> 05:56.438
would be wary of a man
with fire-breathing monsters,

05:56.522 --> 06:00.400
but King Argilac Durrandon
wasn't called "the Arrogant" for nothing.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.195
Determined to arrest his family's decline,

06:03.279 --> 06:05.030
he sent an envoy to Dragonstone

06:05.114 --> 06:09.117
to enlist Aegon Targaryen
and his dragons against his enemies.

06:09.494 --> 06:13.080
In exchange,
Argilac offered lands he didn't have

06:13.164 --> 06:15.123
and a wife Aegon didn't need,

06:15.208 --> 06:20.629
for, as the Valyrians did,
Aegon had wed his elder sister, Visenya.

06:20.755 --> 06:25.133
Then, as the Valyrians didn't,
he took the younger Rhaenys as well.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.886
Two sisters, two wives.

06:27.970 --> 06:31.139
Perhaps that's why he was so keen
to get off Dragonstone.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.893
Aegon countered Argilac with courtesy.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.728
He sent his own envoy requesting

06:36.813 --> 06:41.483
that Princess Durrandon's hand be given
instead to Aegon's closest friend,

06:41.609 --> 06:44.903
and rumored half-brother, Orys Baratheon.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.823
Argilac answered with a box and a note,

06:47.907 --> 06:51.326
"These are the only hands
your bastard shall have of me."

06:51.702 --> 06:55.831
Inside the box
were the hands of Aegon's envoy.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.959
How long had Aegon been waiting
for such a pretext?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.545
As his army prepared to sail,

07:01.629 --> 07:05.340
ravens flew to every great lord
of the Seven Kingdoms.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.259
All bore the same message.

07:07.343 --> 07:11.304
From this day forth,
there would be but one king in Westeros.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.433
Those who bent the knee
to Aegon of House Targaryen

07:14.517 --> 07:16.351
would keep their lands and titles.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.979
Those who took up arms against him

07:19.063 --> 07:22.399
would be thrown down,
humbled and destroyed.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.693
Poor old Argilac.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.529
He couldn't even match Aegon in arrogance.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.157
Aegon landed at the mouth
of the Blackwater River

07:30.241 --> 07:32.492
and raised a primitive "Aegonfort"

07:32.577 --> 07:36.204
in the disputed land between
Harren's and Argilac's kingdoms,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.999
so that neither could decide
whose problem he was.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.210
Adopting the customs
of the Seven Kingdoms,

07:42.336 --> 07:44.087
Aegon unfurled his own banner

07:44.172 --> 07:48.175
with a red three-headed dragon
breathing fire upon a black field.

07:48.426 --> 07:53.138
Visenya crowned him
with a ruby-studded circlet of Valyrian steel,

07:53.222 --> 07:54.681
while Rhaenys hailed him as

07:54.765 --> 07:58.768
the first high king the continent had seen
since the Dawn Age.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.646
As his lords
and the gathered locals cheered him,

08:01.731 --> 08:05.108
Aegon named his loyal friends
to a "Small Council"

08:05.193 --> 08:10.071
led by Orys Baratheon,
whom he called, "My strong right hand."

08:10.531 --> 08:11.823
The title stuck,

08:11.908 --> 08:14.868
and a bastard became
the first Hand of the King.

08:16.329 --> 08:21.541
But for now, Aegon's kingdom contained
only a rocky island and a handful of fields.

08:21.626 --> 08:26.713
The other kings had larger armies, ships,
castles and thousands of years of rule.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.840
But Aegon had dragons.

08:28.925 --> 08:33.261
He had chosen for the words of his house,
"Fire and blood."

08:33.638 --> 08:38.725
Before he was done,
the rivers, fields and skies would turn red.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.197
EURON: Harren of House Hoare
inherited a kingdom

08:52.281 --> 08:55.534
that stretched from
the Iron Islands to the Trident,

08:55.618 --> 09:00.580
too great a kingdom to rule
from a castle as shitty as Pyke.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.707
For 40 years, his ironborn

09:02.792 --> 09:04.102
- plundered the Riverlands
- (METAL CLANKING)

09:04.126 --> 09:09.130
for stone, timber
and slaves to build a seat worthy of him.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.386
Legend has it that masons laid
the final stone in Harrenhal

09:14.470 --> 09:18.223
on the very day
that Aegon landed in Westeros.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.726
Could've been a divine omen.

09:21.811 --> 09:26.982
Could've been the masons wanted to fuck off
before the dragons got there.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.693
They weren't the only ones.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.695
At Aegon's approach,

09:31.779 --> 09:36.074
Harren's riverlords revolted,
led by House Tully.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.784
I doubt Harren noticed.

09:38.494 --> 09:42.163
Harrenhal could repel
an army of a million men.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.791
No ladder could summit its walls,

09:44.875 --> 09:47.085
and no ram could shatter them.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.256
The castle was as impregnable
as an old maid's cunt.

09:51.632 --> 09:56.177
Harren shut his gates around himself,
his sons, and his ironborn,

09:56.262 --> 10:00.599
and waited for Aegon's army
to drain back into the muck.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.979
When Aegon finally saw the monstrous castle,
he asked for parley.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.148
Harren granted it.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.611
Valyria had been the greatest empire
the world had ever seen.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.989
Harren wanted to piss on its ashes.

10:17.575 --> 10:21.745
AEGON: "Yield now, and you may remain
as Lord of the Iron Islands.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.791
"Yield now, and your sons will live
to rule after you.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.629
"You see my army outside your walls.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.214
"You see my dragons."

10:34.050 --> 10:37.260
HARREN: "What is outside my walls
is of no concern.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.387
"Those walls are strong and thick."

10:40.431 --> 10:41.973
AEGON: "Dragons fly."

10:42.350 --> 10:43.892
(HARREN LAUGHS DERISIVELY)

10:43.976 --> 10:46.311
HARREN: "But stone doesn't burn."

10:46.771 --> 10:50.774
AEGON: "When the sun sets,
your line shall end."

10:52.068 --> 10:54.986
EURON: Harren spat
and returned to his castle.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.948
Once inside, he promised lands,
riches and Tully's daughters

10:59.033 --> 11:02.619
to whoever could bring down
Aegon or his dragon.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.288
As the sun sank below the horizon,

11:05.373 --> 11:08.708
all of Harren's men patrolled the battlements,

11:08.793 --> 11:11.961
hearing wings in every gust of wind.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.507
But the moon rose, and sank,

11:15.591 --> 11:17.634
and no dragon appeared.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.970
VISERYS: While the ironborn
were ringing the battlements,

11:21.055 --> 11:25.183
Aegon drove his dragon Balerion
higher and higher in the night sky

11:25.267 --> 11:29.312
so that even the great castle of Harrenhal
looked like an anthill below them.

11:29.689 --> 11:34.401
Then they plunged straight into the castle,
well inside the guarded walls.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.738
The five towers of Harrenhal
reached towards Aegon like a hand.

11:38.823 --> 11:43.284
Balerion opened his mouth
and bathed all the fingers in flame.

11:43.619 --> 11:48.415
EURON: Harren was right, stone doesn't burn,
but men do,

11:48.499 --> 11:51.334
even when they're ironborn. (SNIGGERS)

11:52.253 --> 11:55.755
The dragon blasted my ancestors into ash

11:55.840 --> 11:58.842
that choked the survivors
when they screamed.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.804
Harren's soldiers leapt from the battlements
and died.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.724
They huddled against the walls and died.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.811
They fled across the yard and died.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.982
Harren and his sons took shelter
inside the castle.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.192
The stone didn't burn,

12:16.277 --> 12:21.656
but as Balerion blasted it with fire,
it glowed white-hot.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.991
(LAUGHS DERISIVELY)

12:23.534 --> 12:28.413
The world's greatest castle
became the world's greatest oven,

12:28.497 --> 12:31.666
baking the last of House Hoare within it.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.419
VISERYS: Outside the castle walls,

12:34.503 --> 12:37.756
the towers of Harrenhal
glowed red against the night

12:37.840 --> 12:41.676
and began to twist and melt
like five huge candles

12:41.761 --> 12:45.847
with liquid stone
trickling down their sides like wax.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.350
The next morning,
Aegon forged a new Riverlands.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.439
He named the rebel Edmyn Tully
as his Lord Paramount of the Trident,

12:54.523 --> 12:58.443
and had the other riverlords swear him fealty
as their new liege.

12:58.527 --> 13:02.363
For centuries, House Hoare
had terrorized the Riverlands.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.032
Under House Tully,

13:04.116 --> 13:07.786
the Riverlands would at last
return to peace and prosperity.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.581
After the castle cooled enough
to allow men inside,

13:11.665 --> 13:15.293
Aegon ventured into the ruin
he'd made of Harrenhal.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.963
He saw the ashen bodies, the scorched stone

13:19.048 --> 13:22.383
and the mangled and melted swords
of his former enemies.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.302
To his men's confusion,

13:24.386 --> 13:28.723
he ordered these useless swords collected
and sent to his Aegonfort.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.988
VARYS: While Aegon marched on Harrenhal
after his coronation,

13:44.073 --> 13:49.118
Orys Baratheon had taken most of his forces,
and his Queen Rhaenys with her dragon,

13:49.203 --> 13:51.955
south to deal with the excuse for the invasion,

13:52.039 --> 13:55.542
Argilac the Arrogant, King of the Stormlands.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.919
Argilac had his seat at Storm's End,

13:58.003 --> 14:02.173
a castle considered the most impregnable
in Westeros after Harrenhal.

14:02.466 --> 14:06.636
Argilac may have been arrogant,
but he wasn't stupid or a coward.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.932
His lords advised him to shut his gates
and wait out the siege,

14:11.016 --> 14:13.351
but he'd heard
what had happened at Harrenhal

14:13.435 --> 14:17.605
and refused to die a suckling pig
cooked in his own castle.

14:17.815 --> 14:22.193
He would meet victory or defeat the same way,
with sword in hand.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.156
He called his banners and marched
to meet Orys Baratheon in the field.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.577
Thanks to Rhaenys' dragon, Meraxes,

14:30.661 --> 14:34.205
Orys knew Argilac was coming,
how many men he had,

14:34.290 --> 14:35.999
and how fast he marched.

14:36.292 --> 14:41.296
So Orys simply seized the high ground
and dug in on the hills to wait for Argilac.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.464
As the two armies approached,

14:43.549 --> 14:47.010
the wind rose to meet them,
and the rain poured from the sky,

14:47.094 --> 14:51.556
a gale which would give the battle
its name, "the Last Storm."

14:52.016 --> 14:56.728
King Argilac's lords urged him to wait
for the weather to die down,

14:56.812 --> 14:58.897
but the Storm King saw that the rain

14:58.981 --> 15:02.984
was blowing into the faces
of the Baratheon men on their hills,

15:03.068 --> 15:07.280
and Argilac outnumbered
the Baratheon host two-to-one,

15:07.364 --> 15:10.700
with four times as many knights
and heavy horse.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.369
Argilac attacked.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.749
Three times Argilac led his knights
against the Baratheon line,

15:17.833 --> 15:21.836
but the hills were steep
and the rain had beat the earth to mud.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.785
- The warhorses foundered and slipped,
- (SWORDS CLANKING)

15:24.840 --> 15:26.674
and the charges collapsed.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.718
The battle seemed lost

15:28.844 --> 15:31.512
until Argilac ordered
his spearmen up the hill.

15:32.222 --> 15:36.059
Blinded by the rain, the Baratheons
didn't see them until it was too late.

15:36.185 --> 15:40.229
- One hill fell, then another, and another,
- (MEN YELLING AND GRUNTING)

15:40.314 --> 15:43.650
until only one remained
in the Baratheon center.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.486
If Argilac could break through there,

15:46.570 --> 15:50.281
he could split the invading army
and flank both halves.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.701
Argilac and his men charged,
and the Baratheon line broke...

15:54.870 --> 15:58.206
Revealing Queen Rhaenys and Meraxes.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.919
Argilac's vanguard burst into flame,
and his men panicked.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.338
- The victory charge fell into chaos,
- (HORSES WHINNYING)

16:05.422 --> 16:08.174
and Argilac himself
was thrown from his horse.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.301
But he didn't yield.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.470
When Orys Baratheon arrived,

16:12.554 --> 16:15.473
he found the old king holding off
half a dozen men,

16:15.557 --> 16:17.976
another half-dozen dead at his feet.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.437
Orys dismounted
to meet the king on equal footing

16:21.522 --> 16:25.066
and offered Argilac one final chance to yield.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.652
Argilac cursed him instead.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.113
As the storm raged around them,

16:30.197 --> 16:33.032
the grizzled old warrior
and the bearded upstart

16:33.117 --> 16:35.284
fought for life and kingdom.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.330
- In the end, Argilac got his wish.
- (SWORDS CLANKING)

16:39.415 --> 16:41.791
He died, sword in hand.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.420
As word of Argilac's death spread,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.881
his lords and knights
threw down their swords and fled.

16:49.174 --> 16:54.220
Orys and his vanguard rode to Storm's End
to claim Argilac's castle for Aegon

16:54.304 --> 16:57.140
only to find the gates barred
and the walls manned.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.560
Argilac's daughter had assumed his crown,

17:00.644 --> 17:04.689
and the new Storm Queen
was as fond of yielding as her father.

17:05.399 --> 17:10.069
She declared that Orys would win
only bones, blood and ashes here.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.697
But her men were weaker than her,

17:12.781 --> 17:16.659
and that night Orys found
Argilac's daughter delivered,

17:16.744 --> 17:19.579
gagged, chained and naked to his camp.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.458
Argilac had refused to give Orys her hand.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.210
Now, Orys could have
any part of her he wished.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.504
But Orys unchained the girl,

17:28.589 --> 17:32.258
wrapped his cloak around her
and poured her a glass of wine.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.846
He told her he would take the arms,
banner and words of House Durrandon,

17:36.930 --> 17:40.058
to honor her father's courage
in the Last Storm.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.644
Conveniently, Orys had none of his own
to discard first.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.732
The crowned stag
became the sigil of House Baratheon,

17:47.816 --> 17:50.151
and Storm's End their seat.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.029
Argilac's daughter
would even remain in her home,

17:53.113 --> 17:55.990
though as a lady instead of a princess.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.410
The Stormlands were now Aegon's,

17:59.495 --> 18:03.498
and as tribute, Aegon demanded
the swords of the men Orys had defeated.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.418
For what purpose, Orys didn't know.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.226
JAIME: Aegon now ruled
two of the Seven Kingdoms,

18:23.310 --> 18:26.646
but he would no longer
be able to take the rest piecemeal.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.273
For the first time in thousands of years,

18:29.358 --> 18:33.361
the kings put aside their squabbles
and joined forces against a common enemy.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.239
My ancestor, King Loren of House Lannister,

18:36.323 --> 18:39.325
was head of the wealthiest family
in the Seven Kingdoms.

18:39.535 --> 18:43.955
When King Loren joined his forces to
Mern of House Gardener, King of the Reach,

18:44.039 --> 18:46.874
they had the mightiest army in history,

18:46.959 --> 18:51.295
a so-called "iron fist"
to break the would-be conqueror.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.966
But while an iron fist
can smash a man's face in battle,

18:55.050 --> 18:58.052
you'd look silly hunting birds
or beasts with it,

18:58.554 --> 19:01.222
and Aegon had a creature that was both.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.226
The kings had never even seen a dragon,
let alone fought one.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.478
They had fought each other
for thousands of years,

19:07.563 --> 19:10.565
and victory always went to the larger army.

19:10.899 --> 19:15.236
Surely a force five times that of Aegon's
could manage one dragon...

19:16.113 --> 19:18.489
But Aegon arrived with three.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.702
Still, the Lannisters and Gardeners
hoped for victory.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.456
The battlefield they chose was a wide plain
with firm ground and clear skies.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.209
Perfect for archers and mounted cavalry.

19:30.711 --> 19:34.714
But neither of the kings spared a thought
for why the ground was firm.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.382
There had been no rain for a fortnight,

19:36.466 --> 19:39.302
which meant all the wheat and grass on it
were bone-dry.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.762
- Perfect for dragons.
- (HOOVES THUDDING)

19:42.598 --> 19:43.890
At first, the kings looked like

19:43.974 --> 19:45.774
- they would emerge victorious.
- (HORN BLOWS)

19:46.268 --> 19:49.312
When the horn blew for battle,
their armies swept around Aegon's flanks

19:49.396 --> 19:52.523
and their iron fist of mounted knights
smashed through his center

19:52.608 --> 19:54.609
before the dragons could even enter the fray.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.739
But then Aegon and his sisters took flight
and unleashed their dragons

19:59.823 --> 20:03.534
not on the soldiers,
but on the dry fields all around them.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.704
- The iron fist unclenched
- (MEN SCREAMING)

20:06.788 --> 20:09.373
- and became a hand outstretched for mercy.
- (HORSE WHINNIES)

20:10.584 --> 20:12.919
As Aegon promised, he had none.

20:14.129 --> 20:18.299
More than 4,000 men died in the fires,
another 1,000 escaping them.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.760
Tens of thousands
returned home as monsters,

20:20.844 --> 20:23.387
burned and scarred beyond recognition.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.973
House Gardener never returned at all.

20:26.058 --> 20:30.770
The "Field of Fire," as the singers call it,
claimed the last of the Gardener line,

20:30.854 --> 20:32.855
and House Tyrell rose in their stead

20:32.940 --> 20:35.274
as Lords of the Reach
and Wardens of the South.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.152
As for my illustrious ancestor,

20:38.237 --> 20:40.404
when King Loren saw the battle was lost,

20:40.489 --> 20:43.407
he rode through a wall of flame
and smoke to safety...

20:43.492 --> 20:46.786
Or at least to a heroic capture a day later,

20:46.870 --> 20:49.705
where he laid his sword
before Aegon and knelt.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.252
Aegon, true to his word, spared him
and confirmed House Lannister

20:54.336 --> 20:57.505
as Lords of Casterly Rock
and Wardens of the West.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.257
Why wouldn't he?

20:59.341 --> 21:04.345
A Lannister always pays his debts,
and now we owed our lives to the crown.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.932
That was worth centuries of subservience,
at least.

21:08.809 --> 21:13.020
Besides, Aegon had a fetish
for collecting swords, not heads.

21:13.855 --> 21:17.108
He added Loren's to the pile
his men had retrieved from the Field of Fire

21:17.192 --> 21:19.402
and sent them back to the Aegonfort.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.750
SANSA: With most of the South
in Aegon's hands,

21:34.835 --> 21:38.546
the best chance to throw back
the Conqueror now lay with the North,

21:39.047 --> 21:41.215
if we cared enough to try.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.967
Unlike our southern rivals,

21:43.051 --> 21:46.387
the Stark Kings of Winter
didn't forge the North into one kingdom

21:46.471 --> 21:48.431
for glory or gold,

21:48.515 --> 21:51.517
there is little of either here, but to survive.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.185
Alone in Westeros,

21:53.270 --> 21:57.648
the North remembered when
worse than dragons laid waste to armies.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.525
Thousands of years ago,

21:59.609 --> 22:03.612
the sun set on the realms of men
and the Long Night began.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.950
A new race emerged
from the ice and snow, the White Walkers.

22:08.035 --> 22:12.496
They demanded no crown,
offered no terms, spared no life,

22:12.581 --> 22:14.081
and the dead marched with them.

22:14.416 --> 22:19.420
With humanity facing extinction,
a Stark sought out the Children of the Forest,

22:19.504 --> 22:21.672
the most ancient beings in Westeros,

22:21.757 --> 22:24.800
and convinced them to ally
with the men they'd once fought.

22:25.552 --> 22:30.056
Together the two races pushed the Walkers
back into the Land of Always Winter

22:30.140 --> 22:33.434
and sealed it off from
the Seven Kingdoms with the Wall,

22:33.518 --> 22:39.315
300 miles of ice, stone and earth
rising nearly 700 feet tall.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.693
To guard it,
they established the Night's Watch,

22:42.778 --> 22:45.988
a brotherhood sworn to defend
the living from the dead,

22:46.073 --> 22:49.033
whose vows erase both titles and crimes.

22:49.618 --> 22:54.205
VISERYS: After the Long Night, the North
tried to forget it belonged to the continent,

22:54.289 --> 22:57.833
perhaps through pride,
perhaps through sheer ignorance.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.835
You never can tell with the North.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.381
But as news of Aegon's dragons spread,

23:03.465 --> 23:08.552
Torrhen Stark, the King of Winter,
knew he couldn't forget Westeros any longer

23:09.054 --> 23:11.555
and summoned his lords to Winterfell.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.558
Many fools shrugged off the threat

23:14.643 --> 23:18.854
while the rest placed wagers on
how long the South would take to burn.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.775
Torrhen silenced them
with a command to assemble their armies

23:22.859 --> 23:26.070
and descend from the North in force.

23:26.321 --> 23:30.074
SANSA: As the kings of the Rock
and the Reach burned on the Field of Fire,

23:30.158 --> 23:32.785
the greatest Northern force
since the Long Night

23:32.869 --> 23:34.912
crossed the Neck into the Riverlands.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.832
But when King Torrhen arrived at the Trident,

23:37.916 --> 23:40.418
he saw on the opposing riverbank

23:40.502 --> 23:43.879
the combined strength of
all Aegon's conquered kingdoms.

23:44.506 --> 23:50.177
A force larger than Torrhen's own by half,
and with three dragons.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.264
VISERYS: That night, King Torrhen
called a conference

23:53.348 --> 23:55.683
of all his lords and advisers.

23:55.767 --> 24:00.354
Some wanted to fight,
and trust Northern valor to carry the day,

24:00.439 --> 24:02.481
and burn on the Trident.

24:02.774 --> 24:06.152
The wisest of them
wanted to withdraw to Moat Cailin,

24:06.236 --> 24:11.449
the fortress which had thrown back
every southern invasion, and burn there.

24:11.700 --> 24:16.745
One suicidal lord even wanted to
ambush Aegon's camp in the dark

24:16.830 --> 24:21.834
and kill the dragons as they slept,
or at the very least their riders.

24:22.043 --> 24:25.212
Hard to tell what would've been his fate.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.841
Burning, beheading, dismemberment?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.093
Perhaps all three.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.762
SANSA: My ancestor listened to their counsel,

24:33.847 --> 24:35.575
- and in the morning crossed the Trident
- (HOOVES THUDDING)

24:35.599 --> 24:37.391
under a flag of parley.

24:37.476 --> 24:42.021
Then King Torrhen of House Stark
laid his ancient crown at Aegon's feet,

24:42.105 --> 24:45.608
and was named Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North...

24:46.651 --> 24:48.569
VISERYS: And the King Who Knelt.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.404
SANSA: He had no choice,

24:50.489 --> 24:55.326
and thanks to him our soldiers returned
to their homes whole and unharmed.

24:56.161 --> 25:00.164
The swords that Aegon took from them
were not twisted, burnt or mangled.

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
VISERYS: Yet.

25:13.428 --> 25:17.014
LITTLEFINGER: The Vale of Arryn
was the last of the great kingdoms left.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.682
Old and proud,

25:18.767 --> 25:22.353
House Arryn did
what they always did in times of strife.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.940
They shut the Bloody Gate,
sealing off the Vale.

25:26.274 --> 25:30.486
Then the Queen-Regent Sharra
of House Arryn retreated with her son,

25:30.570 --> 25:35.908
the boy king Ronnel, into the Eyrie,
their family's impregnable fortress.

25:36.284 --> 25:40.913
From the top of their mountain,
they could look down on Westeros far below,

25:40.997 --> 25:44.041
its problems hidden beneath the clouds.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.294
But one day Queen Sharra
entered the outer courtyard

25:47.379 --> 25:50.548
to find her young son sitting on the knee
of Visenya Targaryen,

25:50.632 --> 25:53.676
- and ogling her dragon, Vhagar, beside her.
- (VHAGAR GROWLING SOFTLY)

25:54.219 --> 25:56.845
Just as he'd ask for another cake at dinner,

25:56.930 --> 26:01.642
little King Ronnel asked his mother if
he could go flying on the nice lady's dragon.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.144
Visenya smiled at Sharra.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.648
So, Sharra imagined, did Vhagar.

26:08.858 --> 26:10.359
Remembering her manners,

26:10.443 --> 26:14.363
Sharra asked if she could have Visenya
brought some wine or food,

26:14.447 --> 26:16.824
she must be tired after such a long flight.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.159
But Visenya demurred.

26:19.369 --> 26:23.414
Bored with his mother's pleasantries,
Ronnel demanded an answer.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.499
Poor boy.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.252
He didn't even understand the question.

26:28.837 --> 26:33.591
Sharra hesitated for a moment,
then asked Visenya, as a mother,

26:33.675 --> 26:35.342
if it were safe for the boy.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.970
Visenya assured her it was.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.348
What choice did Sharra have?

26:41.808 --> 26:44.018
Whilst her son circled the castle,

26:44.102 --> 26:47.938
she collected his little ringlet,
her own regent's coronet,

26:48.023 --> 26:50.899
and the ancient Falcon Crown
of Mountain and Vale,

26:50.984 --> 26:53.694
which the Arryns had worn
for thousands of years.

26:54.571 --> 26:59.241
Ronnel had taken to the sky as a king,
but he landed as a lordling.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.285
Perhaps he considered his ancient rights

27:01.369 --> 27:05.706
a fair trade for a few minutes of flight,
as a little boy would.

27:05.957 --> 27:11.211
More likely he didn't even notice
the three crowns at Visenya's feet,

27:11.296 --> 27:14.840
or recognize the swords
of his garrison beside them.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.023
VISERYS: The heads of Westeros
had bowed to Aegon,

27:31.107 --> 27:33.859
but its heart still beat free.

27:33.943 --> 27:37.446
Oldtown, the center of the Faith of the Seven.

27:38.073 --> 27:42.117
There dwelt the High Septon,
the Father of the Faithful,

27:42.202 --> 27:44.953
who commanded the obedience
of all Westeros,

27:45.038 --> 27:48.540
save the savages of the North
and their Old Gods.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.377
When Aegon had landed in Westeros,

27:51.461 --> 27:54.463
the High Septon had locked himself
in the Starry Sept

27:54.547 --> 27:57.591
and fasted for seven days and seven nights,

27:57.676 --> 27:59.843
one for each of his gods.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.806
All he received for his trouble
was the divine wisdom

28:03.890 --> 28:08.852
that if Oldtown took up arms
against the Dragon, the city would burn,

28:08.937 --> 28:11.188
faithful and faithless alike.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.358
After the submission of House Stark,

28:14.442 --> 28:18.779
Aegon marched towards Oldtown,
steeling himself for another battle.

28:19.447 --> 28:23.450
But he found the gates open,
with the High Septon welcoming him.

28:24.452 --> 28:29.248
The pious fool even had the arrogance
to grant what Aegon had already won,

28:29.332 --> 28:34.211
and anointed the last Valyrian
as "Aegon of House Targaryen,

28:34.295 --> 28:38.173
"First of His Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men,

28:38.258 --> 28:42.428
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm."

28:42.721 --> 28:47.391
As if titles meant anything to a man
before whom time itself now bowed.

28:47.976 --> 28:53.147
The maesters would hence divide all history
into "Before" and "After Conquest."

28:55.191 --> 28:59.570
Most expected Aegon to stay
and make Oldtown his seat,

28:59.654 --> 29:04.950
but soon after his coronation, Aegon
returned to the mouth of the Blackwater River

29:05.034 --> 29:07.369
where he had first set foot on Westeros.

29:08.329 --> 29:12.166
A small town had since sprouted
around his primitive fort.

29:12.917 --> 29:17.337
To honor their new master,
the locals dubbed it King's Landing,

29:17.505 --> 29:19.631
though it looked more fit for a hedge knight,

29:19.716 --> 29:22.760
with wooden palisades, muddy streets

29:22.844 --> 29:27.681
and piles of mangled swords
carted in from every corner of the conquest.

29:28.516 --> 29:32.770
But when Aegon made it his court,
wood became stone.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.689
Black mud was buried beneath a Red Keep.

29:35.774 --> 29:40.611
And the collected swords of Aegon's foes
were blasted by dragonfire,

29:40.695 --> 29:43.655
and became a seat fit for the Conqueror

29:43.740 --> 29:46.784
and the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

29:47.702 --> 29:49.369
House Targaryen.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.954
My family.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.373
My throne.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.126
Or so it should've been.

30:08.807 --> 30:13.227
VARYS: But while Aegon titled himself
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,"

30:13.311 --> 30:16.021
in reality he held only six.

30:16.105 --> 30:19.525
The seventh, Dorne, had never knelt.

30:20.109 --> 30:23.779
Visenya had flown into the Vale
and returned with its crown.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.364
Mimicking her sister,

30:25.448 --> 30:29.535
Rhaenys had flown over the enemy force
holding the passes into Dorne,

30:29.661 --> 30:34.832
and landed in the castle of its ruling lady,
Princess Meria of House Martell.

30:34.999 --> 30:39.294
Meria was 80 years old, fat, bald and blind.

30:39.379 --> 30:44.258
Behind her back, many sniggered at her
as the "Yellow Toad of Dorne."

30:44.342 --> 30:47.052
The beautiful Rhaenys probably
thought as much when they met.

30:47.303 --> 30:50.514
She demanded Princess Meria
kneel to her brother Aegon,

30:50.598 --> 30:53.809
though she allowed that on account of
Meria's age and health,

30:53.893 --> 30:56.103
a simple vow of submission would do.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.983
But the Princess told the Queen
that the Targaryens weren't wanted in Dorne,

31:01.067 --> 31:05.779
and no Martell would ever bow, bend or break
no matter how badly they burned.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.657
Rhaenys could have mounted her dragon
right then

31:08.741 --> 31:13.203
and roasted Meria in the castle
as her brother had done at Harrenhal.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.873
But whatever she saw in Meria's eyes

31:15.957 --> 31:18.375
scared her right back to King's Landing,

31:18.459 --> 31:20.836
with her dragon's tail between its legs.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.839
After Aegon's coronation,

31:23.923 --> 31:27.134
Rhaenys returned to Dorne
with Aegon and Visenya

31:27.760 --> 31:29.261
and their dragons.

31:29.679 --> 31:34.266
But no armies met them in the field,
and no lords defied them in their castles.

31:34.350 --> 31:38.186
As the dragons approached,
Dorne simply emptied.

31:38.813 --> 31:42.900
House Martell had learned
from Harrenhal and the Field of Fire.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.235
The dragons were unbeatable in battle,

31:45.320 --> 31:47.029
but wars were more than battles.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.782
Unopposed, Aegon claimed Dorne
for his own.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.243
But as soon as he returned to King's Landing,

31:53.328 --> 31:58.332
his castellans were hurled off towers,
and his royal garrison vanished in the desert,

31:58.416 --> 32:00.292
never to be seen again.

32:00.543 --> 32:05.547
Except, perhaps, when the winds change
and the sands cough up old bones and armor.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.550
Rhaenys returned on Meraxes,

32:08.635 --> 32:12.429
intent on revenging herself
against Meria Martell.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.681
But Dorne was no longer empty.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.643
The Dornish kept Meria's promise,

32:17.727 --> 32:21.021
and fought even while
burning under dragonflame.

32:21.689 --> 32:22.856
And they won.

32:23.608 --> 32:28.111
One day a bolt pierced the eye of Meraxes
and knocked the dragon out of the sky.

32:28.821 --> 32:33.659
House Martell remained unbroken,
unlike the unfortunate Rhaenys.

32:34.369 --> 32:39.957
In their wrath, Aegon and Visenya set flame
to every castle and city but Sunspear,

32:40.041 --> 32:42.376
trying to turn the people
against House Martell.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.962
But the Dornish stayed loyal,

32:45.046 --> 32:47.673
and when Aegon returned to King's Landing,

32:47.757 --> 32:51.510
he found assassins waiting for him
in the streets of his own capital.

32:51.594 --> 32:56.640
If not for Visenya, the Conqueror would
not have enjoyed his Conquest for very long.

32:56.724 --> 32:59.601
From then on,
the king and his family would be guarded

32:59.686 --> 33:04.314
by the seven greatest knights in the realm,
the Kingsguard.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.653
When Meria died in her sleep,
her weak and tired son sued for peace.

33:10.196 --> 33:15.742
But old Meria had exhausted Aegon as well,
and he granted the request.

33:15.827 --> 33:19.454
The Targaryens still wanted Dorne,
and eventually they would have it,

33:19.539 --> 33:21.373
but not at the point of a sword.

33:21.457 --> 33:25.335
They would buy it the same way
great lords buy anything...

33:25.420 --> 33:26.420
With a daughter.

33:37.515 --> 33:41.685
VISERYS: After the Conquest,
when men looked up, they saw dragons.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.521
Nobles learned to keep their eyes down,

33:44.605 --> 33:47.816
but the gods weren't used to
sharing the heavens.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.821
When Aegon died, the High Septon
led the Faith and its army in revolt,

33:52.905 --> 33:56.116
claiming that the Valyrian tradition
of wedding brother to sister

33:56.200 --> 33:58.660
was an abomination in the eyes of the Seven.

33:58.745 --> 34:03.081
Though no one could explain where
the divine Mother and Father had come from.

34:03.624 --> 34:09.004
My ancestor Maegor the Wise,
or Maegor the Cruel, as men slander him,

34:09.672 --> 34:12.924
put a bounty on the head
of every militant priest,

34:13.009 --> 34:16.887
and miraculously the Faith
soon returned to the septs.

34:17.305 --> 34:21.016
With Dorne in the fold,
and the Faith put in its place,

34:21.100 --> 34:24.269
none in Westeros were left
to oppose my family,

34:24.687 --> 34:27.230
so we started opposing each other.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.482
In the Dance of Dragons,

34:28.566 --> 34:32.110
a Targaryen Princess
tried to steal her brother's throne.

34:32.487 --> 34:36.239
Thanks to her stupidity,
most of our dragons died,

34:36.324 --> 34:39.367
though one thankfully ate her before it did.

34:39.952 --> 34:44.331
But even without our dragons,
we were still the blood of Old Valyria,

34:44.999 --> 34:47.292
which proved just as dangerous.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.669
One of my foolish ancestors didn't see

34:49.754 --> 34:53.298
what separated his bastards
from our family proper,

34:53.382 --> 34:55.592
and legitimized them all on his deathbed.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.428
Adopting the name Blackfyre,

34:58.513 --> 35:03.183
the bastards proved their nature
and tried to seize their father's kingdom.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.353
When they failed, their sons tried.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.147
When the sons failed, their grandsons tried.

35:09.232 --> 35:12.776
Until finally Ser Barristan the Bold,
knight of the Kingsguard,

35:12.860 --> 35:16.780
slew Maelys the Monstrous
in the War of the Ninepenny Kings,

35:16.864 --> 35:19.241
ending the last of the Blackfyre line.

35:20.076 --> 35:24.621
Ultimately, without our dragons
and with our blood diluted by commoners,

35:24.705 --> 35:28.375
we failed to see the greatest threat
growing under our noses.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.044
JAIME: As the saying goes,

35:31.129 --> 35:34.631
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the gods flip a coin."

35:35.716 --> 35:38.218
They must've dropped the one for King Aerys,

35:38.302 --> 35:41.805
for at first he seemed to have
dodged the family madness.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.975
But as he grew older,
he began to see conspirators everywhere,

35:45.059 --> 35:47.769
and where there were none,
he worked to create them.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.939
As one of his Kingsguard, I saw firsthand

35:51.023 --> 35:54.901
that a king who couldn't rule his own mind
couldn't rule seven kingdoms.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.403
We endured his reign

35:56.487 --> 35:58.989
because we hoped his son Rhaegar
would right the realm

35:59.073 --> 36:00.407
when he ascended to the throne.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.910
But then Rhaegar proved as mad as his father

36:03.995 --> 36:06.746
and snatched Lyanna Stark,
daughter of the Warden of the North,

36:06.831 --> 36:09.833
and betrothed to Robert Baratheon,
Lord of the Stormlands.

36:10.084 --> 36:14.171
When Lyanna's father and eldest brother
demanded justice,

36:14.255 --> 36:16.375
- the Mad King obliged,
- (AERYS LAUGHING INSIDIOUSLY)

36:16.424 --> 36:18.592
laughing as he dispensed it.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.887
VARYS: Unsatisfied with only two murders,

36:21.971 --> 36:25.348
the Mad King then ordered
Jon Arryn, Lord of the Vale,

36:25.433 --> 36:29.936
to execute his two wards,
Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.899
Instead, Jon Arryn raised the Vale in revolt.

36:34.275 --> 36:38.028
Ned Stark slipped past royalist sentries
and raised the North,

36:38.112 --> 36:43.867
and Robert won three battles in a single day
to unite the Stormlands behind him,

36:43.951 --> 36:47.454
only to be defeated by a royalist army
and forced to flee,

36:47.955 --> 36:50.790
leaving his home of Storm's End besieged.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.252
SANSA: The Hand of the King
finally cornered Robert

36:54.337 --> 36:55.962
in the town of the Stoney Sept

36:56.047 --> 36:57.881
and sent his soldiers door-to-door

36:57.965 --> 36:59.765
- searching for the rebel leader.
- (KNOCKING)

37:00.134 --> 37:03.261
But the villagers hated the Mad King
and loved Robert,

37:03.346 --> 37:05.722
and kept him one step ahead of the soldiers.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.266
Until only one refuge remained.

37:08.935 --> 37:12.604
As the soldiers closed in,
all the town bells rang out.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.833
- (BELLS TOLLING)
- Hearing of Robert's plight,

37:14.857 --> 37:17.317
our father and Jon Arryn
had rushed to the Riverlands

37:17.443 --> 37:21.279
and enlisted our grandfather, Hoster Tully,
to help them.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.658
Together they routed the Hand's army
and rescued Robert.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.827
To celebrate and cement the Tully alliance,

37:27.912 --> 37:32.123
our father wed our mother, Catelyn,
and Jon Arryn took our Aunt Lysa.

37:33.084 --> 37:37.003
Only a fortnight later,
both men rushed back into the field,

37:37.255 --> 37:39.339
for the dragon had finally woken.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.969
VISERYS: While my father's servants
were losing my father's kingdoms,

37:44.053 --> 37:47.097
my brother Rhaegar
had been cooped up with his...

37:47.556 --> 37:49.057
Mistress? Whore?

37:49.475 --> 37:52.310
Whatever else, I'd call her a distraction.

37:52.395 --> 37:56.564
But now Rhaegar came to his senses
and returned to King's Landing.

37:57.149 --> 38:00.235
He persuaded our father
to summon his estranged friend,

38:00.319 --> 38:04.698
Lord Tywin Lannister, the richest
and most powerful lord in the realm.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.951
- Rhaegar himself would lead the royal army
- (HOOVES THUDDING)

38:08.035 --> 38:09.869
against the usurper, Robert.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.372
- (SWORD SWISHES)
- On the banks of the Trident,

38:12.456 --> 38:15.875
my brother fought the man
whose wife he'd stolen,

38:15.960 --> 38:18.962
and who fought to steal
his birthright in return.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.633
In the end, Robert wanted it more.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.970
His hammer shattered my brother's armor

38:27.054 --> 38:30.724
and its rubies fell into the river like raindrops,

38:30.808 --> 38:32.142
vanishing in the current.

38:33.394 --> 38:38.398
VARYS: With Rhaegar's defeat, nothing stood
between Robert and King's Landing.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.735
Imagine the King's surprise a fortnight later

38:41.819 --> 38:45.822
when he saw not stags,
but lions outside his gates.

38:46.615 --> 38:49.075
His former Hand, Tywin Lannister,

38:49.160 --> 38:52.787
had come to the capital with a force
even Robert couldn't match,

38:52.872 --> 38:54.581
claiming to be loyal to the king.

38:55.249 --> 38:59.627
Trusting what he wanted to believe,
Aerys ordered the gates opened,

38:59.712 --> 39:01.963
and the Lannister forces dutifully began

39:02.048 --> 39:06.885
to rape, pillage and murder
the king's actual loyal subjects.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.306
When Eddard Stark finally arrived
at the capital with Robert's army,

39:11.390 --> 39:14.684
he found Lannister banners
hanging over the sacked city,

39:14.769 --> 39:17.812
Targaryen corpses littering its streets,

39:18.064 --> 39:21.107
and Ser Jaime Lannister
sitting on the Iron Throne.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.402
Below him, the Mad King Aerys,

39:24.487 --> 39:28.990
whom Ser Jaime had sworn to guard,
lay in a pool of his own blood

39:29.075 --> 39:31.743
from a sword thrust through his back.

39:32.411 --> 39:35.663
Lord Eddard might've thanked Ser Jaime
for doing the realm a favor,

39:36.290 --> 39:38.291
but honorable as he was,

39:38.376 --> 39:41.544
Lord Eddard condemned Ser Jaime
as a Kingslayer,

39:42.213 --> 39:44.005
a name he would never escape.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.634
JAIME: Unlike Lord Eddard,

39:47.718 --> 39:51.679
Robert appreciated my contribution
to his glorious victory.

39:52.139 --> 39:55.141
He pardoned me for my crime,
and even kept me on his Kingsguard

39:55.226 --> 39:56.935
beside Ser Barristan Selmy,

39:57.019 --> 39:59.729
who'd been wounded at the Trident
fighting for Rhaegar.

40:00.147 --> 40:04.067
True, both of us had failed to protect
our Targaryen charges,

40:04.151 --> 40:07.153
but perhaps that's what
Robert liked most about us.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.364
When my father presented Robert

40:09.448 --> 40:12.075
with the bodies of Rhaegar's wife
and two children,

40:12.159 --> 40:14.911
Ned Stark hiked up his skirts and demanded

40:14.995 --> 40:17.330
Robert send their killer to Dorne,
and me to the Wall.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.291
But I saw what Ned couldn't.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.503
Robert was ashamed of the bodies,

40:24.338 --> 40:26.881
and more ashamed of his relief.

40:27.925 --> 40:32.720
He knew that Rhaegar's heirs had to die
or his throne would never be safe,

40:32.805 --> 40:35.849
but glorious heroes didn't kill children.

40:36.892 --> 40:39.727
They simply didn't punish their murderers.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.690
VISERYS: No doubt I would've
suffered a similar fate,

40:43.774 --> 40:47.777
but my father had wisely sent me
and my pregnant mother to Dragonstone.

40:48.446 --> 40:53.074
When the usurper heroically sent men
to kill me and my newborn sister

40:53.159 --> 40:55.160
to protect his stolen throne,

40:55.244 --> 40:58.788
a loyal knight smuggled us
across the Narrow Sea to Essos.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.875
And so the last dragons of Valyria,

41:01.959 --> 41:03.960
heirs to the greatest dynasty

41:04.044 --> 41:08.173
from the greatest civilization
this world has ever known,

41:08.257 --> 41:12.427
slept in sewers
and foraged for scraps in alleyways,

41:12.511 --> 41:15.263
one step ahead of the usurper's knives

41:15.347 --> 41:19.517
and one step behind the whispers
of his spymaster Varys.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.145
But we won't run forever.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.690
One day I'll return to my kingdoms
with an army,

41:25.774 --> 41:27.650
take back my throne,

41:27.735 --> 41:31.905
and repay all traitors
with the only coin my family knows.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.658
Fire and blood.
