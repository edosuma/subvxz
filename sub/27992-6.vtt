00:02.473 --> 00:05.752
Daniel came here to find his sister.
Zezi.

00:06.306 --> 00:09.751
If the family don't pay, and he
can't get her off the island,

00:09.776 --> 00:10.815
he'll kill her.

00:10.816 --> 00:12.335
You got a holiday let at Wester Skeld?

00:12.336 --> 00:13.415
Is there a problem?

00:13.416 --> 00:15.535
Cos we've found a body in the premises.

00:15.536 --> 00:17.615
Looks like it could be the murder weapon.

00:17.616 --> 00:20.255
It was blocking a drain at the
back of the guesthouse.

00:20.256 --> 00:23.495
I will find your daughter!

00:23.496 --> 00:25.604
Help!

00:25.605 --> 00:27.815
We're very close to finding
Zezi, I think.

00:27.816 --> 00:29.182
You know where she is?

00:29.183 --> 00:31.460
No, we're going to pay the ransom.

00:34.416 --> 00:35.615
He's clocked us.

00:35.616 --> 00:37.216
Come on, come on!

00:38.442 --> 00:39.962
Jesus!

00:44.936 --> 00:46.416
She's not in there.

00:49.176 --> 00:51.416
Ah, somebody must have tipped him off.

01:44.776 --> 01:45.975
I don't understand.

01:45.976 --> 01:48.016
Why wasn't she in the van?

01:48.260 --> 01:49.815
Where is she?

01:49.816 --> 01:52.375
Don't you dare give up now.

01:52.376 --> 01:53.975
She's alive.

01:53.976 --> 01:55.495
I wish I could believe that!

01:55.496 --> 01:57.375
He was working for somebody.

01:57.376 --> 02:00.015
We find the somebody, we find Zezi.

02:00.016 --> 02:02.576
Sir, we need to go.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.815
We've got an incident at Spiggie beach.

02:04.816 --> 02:06.462
What is it, is it Zezi?

02:06.463 --> 02:07.535
It's not Zezi.

02:07.536 --> 02:08.776
Now, sir.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.800
They must have been forced into a dinghy.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.880
I can't believe someone would do that.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.746
In the middle of the North Sea?

02:54.106 --> 02:55.626
You want to tell me what happened?

02:59.400 --> 03:00.919
Who are they?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.120
I mean, where did they come from?

03:03.460 --> 03:04.820
I'm not sure.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.599
It shouldn't be like this.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.920
No, it shouldn't.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.160
Duncan, what were you doing
down here, anyway?

03:21.839 --> 03:23.119
It's where I woke up.

03:27.960 --> 03:33.920
I had no idea my property was being
used to house people like this.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.740
I didn't.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.200
I know.

03:41.493 --> 03:42.853
I know.

03:43.706 --> 03:45.826
Come on, let's get you in the warm.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.839
Four men.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.420
Death by drowning.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.140
They wouldn't have lasted
20 minutes out there.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.787
Anything else?

04:02.800 --> 04:08.020
Some bruising, signs of a struggle
perhaps, I can't say for sure.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.599
I believe three are from the Middle East,

04:11.600 --> 04:13.780
and one is of African origin.

04:16.713 --> 04:17.913
Nigeria.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.559
I suspect that they were on
their way here,

04:24.560 --> 04:27.199
when the traffickers realised
they were compromised

04:27.200 --> 04:29.360
and then, they abandoned them at sea.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.500
Then, we have another problem.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.439
It's possible that we've
got a leak in the team

04:36.440 --> 04:40.199
and someone is passing information
to the traffickers.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.519
I find that hard to believe!

04:42.520 --> 04:44.740
McGuire knew something was up.

04:45.540 --> 04:48.000
And it gave him the time to delete
everything on his phone.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.480
Who else knew what you were planning?

05:00.893 --> 05:02.213
Alice.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.540
I... I told her.

05:11.546 --> 05:13.026
Not everything, but enough.

05:20.147 --> 05:21.347
Hey.

05:22.386 --> 05:23.946
Hi.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.280
I have to ask you something.

05:34.820 --> 05:36.180
Fire away.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.440
Did you tell...

05:40.739 --> 05:42.019
...anyone...

05:43.520 --> 05:48.660
...what I said about Zezi maybe being
back in safe hands by today?

05:49.520 --> 05:52.080
Did you let it slip to anyone at work?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.713
No.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.980
I knew it was part of the case
you were working on.

06:00.012 --> 06:01.332
What about Chris?

06:04.080 --> 06:08.060
Our conversation has been mainly
focused on how shit our marriage is.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.640
How's that going?

06:14.280 --> 06:15.520
Oh...

06:17.066 --> 06:18.586
...he's heading back to the rigs.

06:20.693 --> 06:23.093
He'll be away for a fortnight,
which is good.

06:24.639 --> 06:27.340
Gives me some time to find
a place of my own.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.780
I honestly believe...

06:34.279 --> 06:36.199
...he's happier out in the North Sea.

06:38.807 --> 06:40.900
Or roughnecking in Angola.

06:43.273 --> 06:45.540
He was away for months then, apparently.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.180
I have to go back to work, Jimmy.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.720
Was there anything else?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.439
Just got this CCTV image from

07:17.440 --> 07:21.039
the domestic security camera
at Olivia's guesthouse.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.959
The day after the Hayes murder,

07:22.960 --> 07:25.420
someone stuffing the knife
down the drain.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.240
We've blown it up as much as we can.

07:30.499 --> 07:31.779
It's not Olivia.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.380
She was here, in custody.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.600
See if you can get it enhanced.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.279
There's going to be somebody from
the protection unit

07:52.280 --> 07:53.639
to meet you in Aberdeen, OK?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.712
They're not going to follow me
about everywhere, are they?

07:55.713 --> 07:58.300
No. You're not even going to
know they're there.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.839
Although, you didn't seem to mind
PC Grant hanging around.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.380
Which is handy, cos he's going with you.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.879
What, did you think I was going to
leave you on your own

08:08.880 --> 08:10.119
for 14 hours?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.319
This is embarrassing.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.640
Thanks.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.399
Keep an eye on Duncan, will you?

08:16.400 --> 08:17.679
I'm worried about him.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.119
And good luck with Alice.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.400
I'll keep you posted.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.919
The main criminal gang in Benin City
is known as The Black Axe.

08:33.919 --> 08:37.279
They seem to have connections to the
Italian mafia, Russian gangs,

08:37.280 --> 08:39.039
UK organised crime,

08:39.039 --> 08:42.599
and they're all making inroads into
trafficking in Europe.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.220
It's a complicated network, and
way out of our league.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.820
OK.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.900
Send everything that we've
got on these...

08:53.320 --> 08:55.679
...poor people to the Trafficking Unit,

08:55.680 --> 09:00.000
because they've got the resources
to track it back to source.

09:00.300 --> 09:04.039
And we can concentrate on keeping
our own house in order.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.700
Fiscal wants to see you.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.313
I've just had word.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.839
The PIRC have recommended to the
Assistant Chief Constable

09:13.840 --> 09:15.479
that Sandy be suspended.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.719
Now, it's not a presumption
of guilt in any way.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.639
They believe the investigation could
be prejudiced if he's not removed.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.639
That is just ridiculous.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.799
He did what any one of us
would have done.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.160
Are you sure about that?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.559
Rhona, I need everybody that
I've got on this.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.359
Jimmy, my hands are tied.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.719
This has come directly from the
Assistant Chief Constable.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.460
You have to tell him.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.720
Right, do I have to tell him now?

09:45.080 --> 09:48.479
Well, I suppose there could be
a breakdown in communication

09:48.480 --> 09:49.959
for a few hours.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.320
He'd appreciate that.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.959
Is everything OK?

10:13.960 --> 10:15.639
Oh, fine.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.920
Officially unemployed.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.980
So, what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.079
So, I just saw something.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.320
Laird shredding stuff.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.440
As you know, we're being audited, so
I thought it looked a bit dodgy.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.440
So, I've tried sticking some of it
back together to read it.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.119
Looks like you've just regurgitated that.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.839
Well, I'm better with computers
than sticky tape.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.399
But it's an invoice for consultancy work,

10:46.400 --> 10:48.199
but it's not on our payroll files.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.240
So, I went through our accounts

10:50.265 --> 10:52.400
and I know that we brought in new
people a couple of months ago,

10:52.425 --> 10:54.199
but I can't find their wages.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.479
And these invoices seem to
total the same amount

10:56.480 --> 10:57.980
that they would have been paid.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.860
So, the workers were getting
paid off the books?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.920
I'm not sure they were
getting paid at all.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.000
What was the name of the company?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.119
You having any luck, Sandy?

11:11.120 --> 11:13.679
The figure planting the knife
doesn't appear anywhere else

11:13.680 --> 11:15.119
on our CCTV that whole night.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.439
Thanks.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.340
Erm, I have something.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.039
I've just been up at the
plant with Donnie.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.479
He found out Laird had secretly
been paying a company

11:25.480 --> 11:28.359
called Northlands Shetland Ltd.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.559
He thought it could be money
that should have been

11:30.560 --> 11:31.751
going to some hired labour.

11:31.752 --> 11:33.920
So, I checked with Companies House.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.020
Northlands is registered in
the name of Alice Brooks.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.600
Put the CCTV on the back burner
for now and, um...

12:01.720 --> 12:04.160
...do a background check on
Alice and Chris Brooks.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.520
- Both?
- Aye, both.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.360
Duncan.

12:51.373 --> 12:52.613
We should talk.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.679
The furniture business Chris
ran in Glasgow,

13:01.680 --> 13:04.639
it's the same address as
Andrea Doyle's tattoo parlour.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.199
They were in the same building.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.575
The building that Benson bought
and then hiked up the rent?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
Yeah.

13:09.601 --> 13:13.300
It's a direct connection between
Chris, Andrea and Benson.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.320
Doesn't mean Chris was aware of them.

13:22.520 --> 13:26.100
Sandy, go and phone the rig he works
on, ask to talk to the manager.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.200
Is there anything else?

13:31.440 --> 13:33.559
He left the military in 2009,

13:33.560 --> 13:35.879
started his business in 2013,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.999
and in between, he worked
in various oil fields.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.559
Yeah, Angola, I know.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.079
No.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.360
Nigeria.

13:45.873 --> 13:47.913
You said that he worked in Angola?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.879
Yeah.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.799
Deepwater rigs, offshore.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.639
And what about Nigeria?

13:54.640 --> 13:56.540
I never mentioned Nigeria.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.860
That's new.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.540
The awkward silence.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.840
Never had one of them before.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.399
What do you now about a company
called Northlands?

14:18.400 --> 14:19.465
Nothing.

14:19.466 --> 14:21.513
You didn't set up a limited
company in that name?

14:21.538 --> 14:23.039
No.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.439
How long did you know Chris
before you married him?

14:25.440 --> 14:26.639
About a year.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.138
And he had the furniture business then?

14:28.139 --> 14:30.839
That's how we met, he sold me
an old toilet roll holder.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.759
Not quite the cute meet, but close.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.359
You know all this.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.799
Yeah, I'm just trying to get a few
things straight in my head.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.160
Why?

14:40.280 --> 14:43.319
The person who put Chris out of
business is Graeme Benson,

14:43.320 --> 14:46.360
and he's a person of interest in
the case that I'm working on.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.079
Is that why you're interviewing me,

14:50.080 --> 14:51.639
but pretending you're not?

14:51.640 --> 14:54.839
There's no pretence, Alice, I need to
know everything you do about Chris.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.559
He spent a lot of time in Nigeria
before he met you.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.799
Not Angola. He lied.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.984
- Well, maybe I got it wrong.
- Well, then, can you get it right?

15:00.985 --> 15:03.519
Because I need to find Zezi Ugara, today.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.919
Chris wouldn't be involved in
people trafficking, Jimmy,

15:05.920 --> 15:07.340
he just wouldn't!

15:07.960 --> 15:09.920
And if he was, I'd know!

15:17.040 --> 15:21.599
The processing plant is paying
a limited company, registered

15:21.600 --> 15:26.039
in your name, money that should be
going to the people who work there.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.520
So, if you didn't set it up,
then Chris did.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.599
And if Chris has committed a crime,

15:31.600 --> 15:34.979
then having the investigating
officer be involved with his wife

15:34.980 --> 15:36.480
would be doing him a favour.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.460
And it would make a conviction difficult.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.380
Is that what you think is going on here?

15:49.800 --> 15:52.020
That I'm trying to compromise you?

15:57.853 --> 15:59.173
No.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.500
Are you sure, Jimmy?

16:04.080 --> 16:06.100
Because I need you to be sure.

16:11.646 --> 16:12.846
I'm sure.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.200
But not about your husband.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.660
Then you'd better talk to him.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.653
I've got work to do.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.279
How long were you in Nigeria for?

16:34.280 --> 16:35.800
About three years, off and on.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.559
Alice seems to think it
was Angola, offshore.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.620
No. It was in Niger Delta.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.319
Odd that she'd say something

16:44.320 --> 16:46.999
as specific as deepwater rigs,
though, isn't it?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.519
Maybe we talked about it.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.660
I did think about going there,
at one point.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.900
You ever been to Benin City?

16:54.120 --> 16:55.900
Yes, I have.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.020
You met a lot of people there,
I would imagine.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.639
Made contacts.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.880
No, I wouldn't say that.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.719
I can't believe you think that I'm
involved in all of this.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.638
Well, Chris, I can't
ignore the fact you've got

17:09.640 --> 17:12.079
a connection to the missing girl,
the country she came from,

17:12.079 --> 17:13.660
and the people who were
holding her hostage.

17:13.661 --> 17:16.960
You can connect anybody to anyone,
if you try hard enough.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.144
You wouldn't be trying to ruin
me, so you could steal my wife,

17:22.602 --> 17:23.660
would you?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.319
And my lawyer would be very interested

17:28.319 --> 17:29.940
to hear about your relationship.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.880
So, you need a lawyer?

17:34.200 --> 17:36.880
I do if I'm dealing with a cop
that's shagging my wife.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.559
Maybe I should take over the interview,

17:43.560 --> 17:46.759
his lawyer will make the most
of you and Alice.

17:46.760 --> 17:47.980
Tosh...

17:48.813 --> 17:51.293
...there is no "me and Alice".

17:51.440 --> 17:53.039
He's playing games with us.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.400
That's all.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.039
- Trust me.
- OK.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.519
I just spoke to the
manager on Brent Alpha.

18:00.520 --> 18:04.119
He has no record of a
Chris Brooks on his rig.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.380
Ever.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.760
Wherever he's going for two weeks
every month, it's not the North Sea.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.999
So, if you haven't been on Alpha,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.020
or any other rig in the Brent
Field, where have you been?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.900
It's not a hard question, Chris.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.480
I was at the house on Yell, trying
to knock it into shape.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.540
So, why did you tell Alice
you were working?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.576
Because I didn't have the heart to admit

18:33.601 --> 18:35.864
I'd made a mistake in buying the place.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.620
It's falling apart, dry rot.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.920
So, I borrowed instead, to give me
the time to fix it up.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.039
And you didn't tell Alice any of this?

18:46.040 --> 18:49.039
No, she'd go ape shit if she knew
I'd taken out another loan.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.695
We'll need the details of the
loan, to confirm your story.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.742
Aye.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.420
What about the money from Gavin Laird?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.359
What money?

18:58.360 --> 18:59.600
Northlands.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.740
That, that was for work I did
up at his place.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.360
And I put it in Alice's
name, to avoid tax.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.780
It's quite a lot of money.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.159
Wasn't for supplying slave labour?

19:18.160 --> 19:19.820
No, it wasn't!

19:20.520 --> 19:22.831
Look, I'm not answering any
more questions.

19:22.832 --> 19:25.120
This is harassment, pure and simple!

19:28.407 --> 19:31.207
I don't think he'll win businessman
of the year, but...

19:32.466 --> 19:34.260
...he could be telling the truth.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.793
I don't buy it.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.420
He didn't need to hide the house
on Yell from Alice.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.560
I going to have to see it for myself.

19:57.800 --> 20:01.759
Give me an hour, and then let him go.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.160
But have Sandy follow him.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.740
You're free to go.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.559
- Sandy.
- Chris Brooks is in The Lounge.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.359
Right, keep an eye on him. I'll let
you know if I find anything.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.920
OK.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.980
Oh, God.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.180
Zezi?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.520
Oh, Christ!

24:22.000 --> 24:23.559
Oh!

24:23.560 --> 24:26.220
Zezi? Zezi?

24:28.240 --> 24:31.159
It's OK. It's OK.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.399
You're safe now. I'm a policeman.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.440
I'm a policeman.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.874
I've been looking for you.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.559
You're safe now.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.600
OK? You're safe.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.479
Just wait a minute.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.333
I've got her.

25:36.973 --> 25:38.693
She's alive.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.140
- Sir?
- Sandy.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.639
Arrest Chris Brooks.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.080
Will do.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.560
I need backup at The Lounge, now.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.440
Oh, shit!

26:50.200 --> 26:52.240
I was at school in Lagos.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.040
The American school.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.080
I was happy there.

27:01.920 --> 27:07.240
But my father died, and my brother
and I, we couldn't survive so well.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.679
There was a man in my church
saying that he could take me

27:13.680 --> 27:16.700
to Paris, could get me a job,

27:18.580 --> 27:20.960
working with his sister in a restaurant.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.920
Good money.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.680
I decided to go.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
But my brother didn't want me to go.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.800
I was taken to Benin City.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.280
And there I was told...

27:41.200 --> 27:43.860
...I was to be sold in a market,

27:44.966 --> 27:46.806
like a slave.

27:48.200 --> 27:54.060
Then a European bought me
and told me everything would be OK.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.860
But then he took my passport
and my papers.

28:05.886 --> 28:07.606
Is this the man?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.960
That wasn't the man that bought me.

28:11.179 --> 28:12.979
He was here when we landed.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.899
Was it this man?

28:24.300 --> 28:26.740
Yes. That's him.

28:33.353 --> 28:37.033
I tried to leave messages for my
brother anywhere I could...

28:38.960 --> 28:42.420
...leave a trail that he could follow,

28:44.186 --> 28:46.226
but I don't think he saw them.

28:47.866 --> 28:49.386
No, I think he did.

28:52.327 --> 28:55.087
He came here to try to find you.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.599
Is he here now?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.340
Can I speak to him?

29:04.846 --> 29:06.526
I'm very sorry, Zezi.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.880
I have bad news about your brother.

29:12.199 --> 29:13.919
Daniel's dead.

29:17.680 --> 29:25.420
He was killed... because he was
asking too many questions...

29:26.640 --> 29:29.900
...and I think he made
the traffickers nervous.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.760
This... this is my fault.

29:34.785 --> 29:36.519
I should have listened to him.

29:36.520 --> 29:41.599
No, no. None of this is your fault.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.940
Now, please, don't think like that.

29:47.720 --> 29:52.780
There's someone else here who
wants to see you.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.760
Er...

29:56.726 --> 29:58.646
...it's your mother.

30:02.897 --> 30:05.282
Well, would you like to see her?

30:05.283 --> 30:09.440
- No.
- OK. That's OK, it's OK.

30:10.520 --> 30:15.199
Now we can organise
somewhere for you to stay tonight,

30:15.200 --> 30:18.279
- where you'll be safe.
- Here.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.100
I want to stay here.

30:24.280 --> 30:29.359
Get Chris Brooks' photo out to
the ferry ports and to Sumburgh.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.520
Nobody goes home until we find him.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.660
Then bring Alice Brooks
in for questioning.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.480
Are you OK?

30:45.840 --> 30:47.639
Yeah, I'm OK.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.040
Olivia, I'm sorry.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.340
Zezi doesn't want to see you.

31:07.020 --> 31:08.420
Not now.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.660
- I need to talk to her.
- I know you do.

31:15.613 --> 31:17.813
She's been through a hell of a lot.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.827
But you've got her back.

31:24.440 --> 31:27.605
That's the important thing, isn't it?

31:28.252 --> 31:31.959
And now you've got
a chance to make things right.

31:31.960 --> 31:36.180
So, just give her a wee bit of time.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.519
Chris hasn't been working on the rigs.

31:42.520 --> 31:47.479
He's been trafficking people,
using his contacts in Nigeria.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.280
It doesn't make any sense.

31:51.499 --> 31:53.859
- You must have got this wrong, Jimmy.
- I'm sorry.

31:55.680 --> 32:00.860
I could never,
never care for a man like that!

32:07.940 --> 32:11.719
Are you saying he killed Daniel
and the others?

32:11.720 --> 32:13.020
I don't know that yet,

32:13.840 --> 32:15.860
but I know he was involved.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.553
Did you know?

32:36.233 --> 32:37.793
Oh, Jimmy...

32:44.620 --> 32:46.140
No.

32:52.626 --> 32:54.306
Do you know where he is now?

32:56.886 --> 32:58.740
I'd tell you if I did.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.480
If he gets in contact with you,
can you call me? Will you do that?

33:10.866 --> 33:12.346
You've got a visitor.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.760
Hello. Hey.

33:18.884 --> 33:21.269
So, I just wondered if you still
fancied something to eat.

33:21.270 --> 33:23.359
Chicken or scampi? Either/or.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.879
So, don't say I don't spoil you.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.300
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.

33:28.739 --> 33:31.059
I'm going to be here all night.

33:31.620 --> 33:34.780
Ach, no worries. I've got to pack anyway.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.399
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.959
No point putting it off, and, well,

33:41.960 --> 33:44.080
there's nothing keeping me here now.

33:46.940 --> 33:48.340
No.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.440
- I don't suppose there is.
- Aye.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.120
Er, sorry, I...

33:55.145 --> 33:58.824
Yeah, sure, it's OK, fine.
I'll let you go.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.880
Uh... Right.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.501
- Have you heard from Chris?
- No. Why? Is there a problem?

34:17.502 --> 34:18.679
Because I need to find him,

34:18.704 --> 34:20.791
so if you've got any idea where
he might be, then tell me.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.520
I've no idea where he is.

34:25.346 --> 34:26.826
What are you doing?

34:28.360 --> 34:31.799
I can't stop thinking about those
people on the beach.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.478
How desperate they were
to have a better life.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.179
I had that, and you're right,
I threw it away.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.918
So, I'm selling up.

34:42.920 --> 34:45.199
Time for a change of scenery.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.760
Is that your idea or Graeme Benson's?

34:50.880 --> 34:54.079
Your accountant's been giving you
bad advice, Duncan.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.799
He works for Benson.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.700
Don't ask me how I know, I just do.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.020
He sabotages businesses and then
he steps in to "save" them.

35:03.619 --> 35:05.339
You've been played.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.380
Tosh.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.159
We got a sighting of Chris Brooks
down at the harbour,

35:18.160 --> 35:19.280
near Calum's boat.

35:19.305 --> 35:21.359
Right, he's going to try
and leave the island.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.840
Look, I'm close.
I'll head down there now.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.440
You looking for me?

35:59.640 --> 36:02.159
I can't let you take this boat out.
You know that, right?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.599
Oh, so I'm going to spend
the rest of my life in jail, then?

36:04.600 --> 36:06.160
Oh, I hope so.

36:08.712 --> 36:10.700
That's not happening.

36:15.386 --> 36:17.106
I want you to know one thing.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.606
I love my wife.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.200
More than you can ever imagine.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.519
So, why were you so happy for her
to have an affair, then?

36:29.520 --> 36:32.240
What, you think I wanted
the two of you to get together?

36:34.520 --> 36:37.020
I just took advantage of the situation.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.500
I didnae wreck your marriage, Chris.

36:43.320 --> 36:46.999
You destroyed it
when you started trafficking people,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.040
when you killed Daniel Ugara.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.800
That was his own fault.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.853
I gave him the chance to get his
sister back. He didn't want to pay!

36:55.878 --> 36:58.118
Yeah, that's
because she's not a second-hand car!

36:58.160 --> 37:00.239
Nobody was supposed to die!

37:00.240 --> 37:05.199
Nobody! You left Zezi Ugara to
suffocate! What about Niki?!

37:05.200 --> 37:07.513
What about the people that
washed up on our beach?!

37:07.538 --> 37:12.140
Were they just
past their sell-by date?! Eh?

37:19.920 --> 37:22.440
I never wanted to get
involved in any of this.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.199
I went back to Benin City to work,

37:27.200 --> 37:30.580
and I got into debt to these...

37:33.080 --> 37:35.140
...local businessmen.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.559
They said I had to set up
a pipeline into the UK or

37:38.560 --> 37:40.060
they were gonnae kill me.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.080
You don't know these people.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.320
I didn't have a choice.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.880
Aye, you did.

37:53.905 --> 37:57.540
Judge and jury, you sanctimonious prick!

38:00.960 --> 38:02.190
You know what?

38:02.191 --> 38:05.519
I'm gonnae go out in a blaze of
glory, take you with me.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.140
Why not?
See what Alice thinks about that.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.440
All right, come on. Come on, then.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.440
What's the matter?

38:20.440 --> 38:22.719
You havnae done this before, have you?

38:22.720 --> 38:25.439
No, you got McGuire
to do your dirty work for you.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.679
Did you get him
to cut up the body as well?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.679
And kill Carla
and Prentice Hayes, cos, what,

38:29.680 --> 38:32.040
they were blackmailing you?

38:33.240 --> 38:35.775
Aye, you didnae have the
stomach for any of it, did you?

38:37.600 --> 38:39.920
And you don't have the stomach
for it now.

38:46.953 --> 38:48.513
Drop it.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.068
You're not as smart as you
think you are, Perez.

39:07.069 --> 39:12.559
I had nothing to do with Prentice
and Carla Hayes. Nothing.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.600
Help him off this boat. Take him away.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.559
He's pretty much given us the set-up.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.199
He made the contacts, brought people in.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.519
Some went to Laird
at the processing plant,

39:45.520 --> 39:46.976
most to Claire McGuire,

39:47.001 --> 39:49.354
who farmed them out through
her agency in Glasgow.

39:49.355 --> 39:50.920
Benson wasn't involved.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.290
Charge all three in concert.

39:55.291 --> 39:58.199
Chris Brooks, Claire McGuire
and Gavin Laird.

39:58.200 --> 40:01.000
Kidnapping, trafficking, murder.
The whole shebang.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.300
What is it?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.420
It's fine.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.880
It's fine.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.012
Just to see the people who
are really behind this,

40:14.037 --> 40:15.160
they're still out there.

40:15.185 --> 40:17.279
That's what gets me. This is just,

40:17.280 --> 40:19.000
just a drop in the ocean.

40:22.099 --> 40:23.659
What about the Hayes?

40:25.320 --> 40:27.879
Claims he had nothing to do
with their murder.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.519
Who else would have a stronger
motive to kill them?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.620
Rhona, we don't have a motive.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.960
All we have is the murder weapon.

40:40.119 --> 40:41.479
Tosh.

40:43.680 --> 40:47.600
All that CCTV footage that you
checked around the guesthouse...

40:49.560 --> 40:52.040
We were only looking for Olivia, right?

40:52.065 --> 40:53.240
Mm-hmm.

40:53.679 --> 40:57.140
Is it possible that we've missed someone?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.740
Do you want to run through it all again?

41:01.520 --> 41:02.920
Hmm.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.060
Your instincts on Laird were bang-on.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.160
Well, it doesn't give me any pleasure.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.599
Try the camera on Market Cross.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.326
Oh, we did.

41:23.327 --> 41:25.340
There was no-one in a hoodie, though.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.640
Just a group of girls.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.540
Hang on.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.380
Are they a group, though?
That one behind. Is she with them?

42:11.240 --> 42:15.560
So, we have the man behind the
trafficking.

42:17.640 --> 42:21.500
He's confessed to ordering
the killing of Daniel Ugara.

42:24.040 --> 42:29.759
But he claims he wasn't involved
with the death of Carla or Prentice.

42:29.760 --> 42:31.280
And you believe him?

42:32.879 --> 42:34.500
Aye, I do.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.766
And so I thought about who else

42:39.767 --> 42:42.159
would have a motive to kill them,

42:42.160 --> 42:45.860
apart from the traffickers,
and I couldn't think of anybody.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.000
Apart from you.

42:52.253 --> 42:53.733
Me?

42:55.920 --> 42:58.660
- What are you talking about?
- There's no point denying it.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.359
We know that you planted the murder
weapon at the guesthouse, to make

43:02.360 --> 43:06.180
us think that it was Olivia Lennox
that killed Carla and Prentice.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.279
Now, I know that that doesn't mean
that you killed them,

43:10.280 --> 43:12.680
because you could have been
protecting Jamie.

43:14.560 --> 43:19.919
But you see, the thing is,
Rosie, I realised that I was there

43:19.920 --> 43:23.439
when you got the idea.
In fact, I gave it to you

43:23.440 --> 43:26.260
when I told you that
Prentice was under suspicion.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.080
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Aye, you do.

43:32.080 --> 43:35.559
He's tangled up in a crime,
someone kills him in revenge,

43:35.560 --> 43:37.919
everybody thinks that they're connected,

43:37.920 --> 43:43.260
and nobody, but nobody,
would be looking at you.

43:46.120 --> 43:50.319
Well, like you said,
so what if I had the knife?

43:50.320 --> 43:53.680
- It doesn't mean I did it.
- You know, I can help you.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.719
- Not if you lie to me.
- Why would I kill Prentice?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.880
I know that you had your reasons.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.740
So, tell me.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.480
Tell me and I'll do what I can for you.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.000
We just want to be together.

44:16.660 --> 44:19.260
- Prentice wouldn't let that happen.
- Shut up, Jamie!

44:28.240 --> 44:31.039
Did you know that she was planning
to kill your brother?

44:31.040 --> 44:32.959
Don't answer that, Jamie.

44:32.960 --> 44:37.980
She must have stabbed him
while he was sleeping, right there.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.839
And then your mum got in the way.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.480
I mean, I'm guessing
that's what happened.

44:50.280 --> 44:54.660
Can you live with that?
Is that who you are?

44:57.220 --> 45:00.700
I mean, it's one thing killing Prentice.
Everybody knew what he was like.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.740
But... you know, your mum?

45:06.333 --> 45:08.253
Everybody loved your mum.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.120
I bet that she even tried to protect
you from Prentice, didn't she?

45:17.080 --> 45:18.474
Yeah, of course she did,

45:18.475 --> 45:22.180
cos, you know, she's your mum.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.239
And maybe you thought that
that's what Rosie was trying to do.

45:27.240 --> 45:33.999
OK. But... are you sure?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.069
Don't listen to him, Jamie!

45:36.070 --> 45:38.760
Because you would have to be sure

45:38.785 --> 45:41.279
to let her get away
with killing your mum.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.359
- It was an accident!
- Jamie!

45:43.384 --> 45:45.784
Sit... down!

45:46.800 --> 45:48.280
Now!

45:53.280 --> 45:57.400
She, she didn't mean to stab Mum.
She didn't.

45:57.425 --> 45:59.359
But are you sure? I mean, were you there?

45:59.360 --> 46:02.239
- She was defending herself!
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Jamie, shut up!

46:02.240 --> 46:04.300
You were! You were!

46:18.520 --> 46:21.220
By the time I realised what had
happened, it...

46:22.666 --> 46:24.266
...it was too late.

46:26.480 --> 46:31.820
We knew that I'd get the blame
if I wasn't injured, so...

46:36.680 --> 46:38.240
...I let her cut me.

46:46.020 --> 46:47.660
Prentice was an animal.

46:49.280 --> 46:51.080
He hurt people for fun.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.720
I don't suppose that makes
a difference to you.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.560
It makes a difference.

47:06.493 --> 47:08.893
It just doesn't change the law.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.780
She just wants to say hello.

48:07.640 --> 48:09.400
What do you think?

48:28.533 --> 48:31.013
You can come and live with me
in London if you want.

48:33.760 --> 48:37.880
I'll sign any papers that you need,
so you can get a passport.

48:40.840 --> 48:42.520
I've even got a sofa bed.

48:45.840 --> 48:50.220
I want to go home, to Nigeria.

48:54.800 --> 48:56.280
Well, after, then.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.940
You could come for a visit.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.740
Or I could come and see you.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.840
At least let me write to you.

49:11.800 --> 49:15.220
You had 18 years to do that!

49:19.600 --> 49:23.140
My family were a danger to kids, Zezi.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.260
And if I could go back in time...

49:33.320 --> 49:38.900
...I would give you up all over
again, to keep you safe.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.640
I was just trying to protect you,
the only way I knew how.

49:50.966 --> 49:52.446
You have to believe that.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.000
You can write.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.160
I'll read your letters.

50:29.006 --> 50:30.526
Sandy.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.860
I've got some bad news.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.240
You've been suspended from
duty, effective immediately.

50:39.080 --> 50:44.279
I'm really sorry. I'm going to need
your warrant card,

50:44.280 --> 50:48.300
your access card, your force-issued
phone, and your laptop.

50:58.386 --> 50:59.986
They... they just told you now?

51:01.240 --> 51:02.720
Yesterday.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.120
Thanks.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.260
Thanks for letting me
see this right through.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.519
I know I look like shit.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.439
I'm so tired, my right eye is
twitching involuntarily.

51:50.440 --> 51:54.820
So, I'm either having a stroke or
I really need my bed.

51:56.200 --> 52:01.340
In which, by the way,
I keep my socks on and earplugs in.

52:03.200 --> 52:07.700
Either way, I don't want you to go.

52:09.720 --> 52:12.500
Stay. Please?

52:13.240 --> 52:15.520
At least till your money runs out.

52:20.826 --> 52:22.986
Well, since you put it like that.

52:38.840 --> 52:41.320
How could I not see what was going on,

52:41.820 --> 52:44.172
what kind of man he was?

52:44.173 --> 52:46.163
Come on. You can't blame
yourself for that.

52:46.188 --> 52:47.919
- Oh, I can.
- Sure.

52:47.920 --> 52:49.200
No problem.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.920
Wasn't like he didn't know what
he was getting himself mixed up in.

52:57.080 --> 52:58.520
OK, so...

52:59.760 --> 53:01.020
...what about us?

53:02.747 --> 53:04.467
What are we going to do?

53:05.973 --> 53:07.533
I don't know, Jimmy.

53:10.680 --> 53:13.720
There was a point there, when
you thought I was setting you up.

53:15.120 --> 53:19.900
Didn't you? Just for a moment?

53:27.920 --> 53:29.580
That's hard to take.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.640
- I had to ask the question. I had to.
- Mm-hmm.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.540
Doesn't change the way I feel about you.

53:40.080 --> 53:42.919
Even though my husband's going to prison?

53:42.920 --> 53:45.626
I, I, I think they stopped burning

53:45.627 --> 53:47.959
the wives along with the husbands
a wee while ago.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.199
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.759
I thought they still did that up here.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.600
Vikings and all that.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.840
Maybe, doing what you do,
it's better to be alone.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.880
Especially here,
where everyone's connected.

54:09.400 --> 54:11.840
That's how you really feel, isn't it?

54:14.000 --> 54:16.580
It's not about the past. It's about now.

54:19.440 --> 54:22.040
You need to be apart from the rest of us.

54:23.560 --> 54:28.140
Just admit it, Jimmy,
because it's your choice.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.920
Come over tomorrow night.
I'll cook you dinner.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.600
I don't think that's a good idea.

55:32.880 --> 55:34.840
So, are you still going
through with this, then?

55:35.324 --> 55:36.803
Aye.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.080
I'm not part of anything here any more.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.600
That's just not true.

55:46.360 --> 55:51.799
I'm not going to lie to you, Duncan.
Watching you live your life

55:51.800 --> 55:57.900
is like watching Scotland trying
to qualify for the World Cup.

55:59.353 --> 56:01.100
It's frustrating,

56:01.760 --> 56:03.740
embarrassing,

56:04.720 --> 56:07.620
at times, excruciating,

56:08.520 --> 56:11.679
but ultimately, I live in hope that

56:11.680 --> 56:13.560
you'll get there in the end.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.359
How many World Cups do you
think we've got left at our age?

56:18.360 --> 56:19.740
Three?

56:20.280 --> 56:21.760
Away you go.

56:23.120 --> 56:26.399
- We've got six or seven at least.
- Huh.

56:28.940 --> 56:31.340
Yeah, that's the difference between
me and you.

56:32.080 --> 56:33.880
You're an optimist at heart.

56:40.960 --> 56:45.660
Don't go. Don't sell to Benson.

56:49.013 --> 56:51.133
I'll gie you the cash for the bistro.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.160
What?

56:57.627 --> 57:00.620
Well, I need to do something with all
that money I've squirreled away.

57:13.339 --> 57:14.779
I've...

57:18.760 --> 57:20.580
I've got, uh...

57:23.120 --> 57:25.880
I've got an artist's impression
you could look at.

57:27.240 --> 57:30.719
Uh, a mood board. You should see what
you're, what you're investing in.

57:30.720 --> 57:33.559
Aye, I'll take a look at them later.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.959
Do you want me
to phone in a pizza or something?

57:35.960 --> 57:37.960
Aye, aye, that'd be great, Mary.

57:43.333 --> 57:45.053
Oh, don't mention it, Fran.
