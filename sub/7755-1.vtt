13:03.082 --> 13:08.820
Oh, forget it!
You're boring, anyway.
>> What?

13:08.822 --> 13:13.825
Boring?
Darwin, do you think I'm boring?
>> Darwin: I wouldn't say

13:13.827 --> 13:17.629
"boring."
You're just much, much, much,
much, much, much, much, much,

13:17.631 --> 13:20.932
less interesting than anyone
else i know.
>> Gumball: Eh.

13:20.934 --> 13:26.905
>> But i do loads of cool stuff.
>> Gumball: Like what?
>> Well, this is my bedroom.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.675
>> Gumball: Are you sure your
mom's not here?
It's not that i find her witch

13:30.677 --> 13:34.679
face creepy or anything, it's
just that i really don't want
her to jump out on me.

13:34.681 --> 13:39.417
>> Both: [ Scream ]
>> Gumball: What's that?!
>> That's my hamster, Barney.

13:39.419 --> 13:44.789
>> Darwin: Dude.
I think that Barney's...
>> Hibernating.

13:44.791 --> 13:48.459
At least that's what my mom
says.
>> Gumball: Yeah. Hibernating.

13:48.461 --> 13:52.063
>> Darwin: Dude!
He's got comics!
>> Gumball: Ohh!

13:52.065 --> 13:56.267
You've got issue 1 of
"captain punch"?!
That's a collector's item!

13:56.269 --> 14:01.105
I take back everything i said.
[ Singing voice ] You're so not
bori-i-ng!

14:01.107 --> 14:05.376
This comic's so extreme my mom
won't even let my dad read it!
[ Thunder crashes ]

14:05.378 --> 14:08.947
>> No matter how much it rains,
this city always smells lovely.
[ Glass shatters ]

14:08.949 --> 14:12.116
[ Siren wailing ]
What's this?
Looks like three ski enthusiasts

14:12.118 --> 14:16.654
have just withdrawn their
hard-earned wages from the bank.
Better get down there...

14:16.656 --> 14:20.725
Safely.
Not so fast, gentlemen!
>> What a pleasant surprise.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.261
It's captain punch.
>> Hey!
>> Hey!

14:23.263 --> 14:25.330
>> [ Laughs ]
Hey!
>> Take this!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.866
Nice bunch of flowers!
Hey!
Is there something on my shoe?

14:27.868 --> 14:33.171
>> Just some bubble gum.
>> Let me wash it off for you.
>> I'm gonna take you guys down

14:33.173 --> 14:39.510
to a nice restaurant for a Swiss
fondue.
My treat!

14:39.512 --> 14:43.681
>> Gumball: Dude, who drew all
over your comic?
>> That's how it was when my mom

14:43.683 --> 14:47.218
gave it to me.
It's pretty cool, huh?
>> Gumball: I...Think we're

14:47.220 --> 14:51.189
gonna go home now.
>> No, no. Wait.
Uh, let me tell you some jokes.

14:51.191 --> 14:57.395
Me and my mom do that all the
time.
>> Gumball: [ Sighs heavily ]

14:57.397 --> 15:01.866
Fine.
>> Why did the chicken cross the
road?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.402
For a perfectly legitimate
reason.
[ Laughs ]

15:04.404 --> 15:07.305
>> Gumball: Dude, that's not a
joke.
That's a sentence.

15:07.307 --> 15:13.478
[ Music box plays ]
>> [ Yawns ]
Bed time.

Hector's diary.
"I must not laugh.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.491
I must not get over-excited.
I must not shout.
I must not sneeze."

15:26.493 --> 15:30.428
This looks like a how-to guide
to ruining your life.
>> Darwin: Who makes him write

15:30.430 --> 15:33.031
all this stuff?
>> Gumball: I think i have an
idea.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.267
>> Darwin: Who?
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
>> I think he means me.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.404
>> Gumball: Aah!
I knew she'd creep up on me!
>> What are you doing in my

15:39.406 --> 15:42.540
son's bedroom?
>> Gumball: What are<i> you</i> doing
taking the fun out of his life?!

15:42.542 --> 15:46.311
>> I think you're being a little
presumptuous telling me how to
raise my son!

15:46.313 --> 15:50.915
>> Gumball: Well, you know what
else is presumptuous?
Your face!

15:50.917 --> 15:54.185
>> You don't know what
presumptuous means, do you?
>> Gumball: [ Scoffs ]

15:54.187 --> 15:58.056
Yeah.
>> Just get out.
>> Gumball: Okay.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.858
[ Scoffs ]
Bet you she<i> is</i> a witch.
>> Darwin: I think you've been

16:00.860 --> 16:04.362
insulting enough for today.
[ School bell rings ]
>> Gumball: Do you think Hector

16:04.364 --> 16:07.298
knows what his mom is doing to
him?
>> Darwin: I don't really think

16:07.300 --> 16:10.001
it's any of our business.
>> Gumball: None of our
business?!

16:10.003 --> 16:13.071
She's the reason we've got no
friends on elmore plus!
No, that's it.

16:13.073 --> 16:17.208
I'm going to speak to him.
[ Smack! ]
Hector, I've been thinking.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.310
It's not<i> your</i> fault you're
boring.
>> [ Chewing ]

16:19.312 --> 16:22.280

Turkey sandwich just there.
>> Huh?

16:22.282 --> 16:26.084
>> Gumball: [ Screams ]
Look, it's your mom's fault
you're boring.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.687
>> Darwin: She's too strict,
man.
>> Gumball: You go tell her to

16:29.689 --> 16:33.491
give you some real comics, some
real movies, and a real live
hamst--

16:33.493 --> 16:37.929
[ smack! ]
>> Well, she does those things
because that's what's best for

16:37.931 --> 16:40.498
me.
>> Gumball: Best for you?
Best for you?!

16:40.500 --> 16:46.104
Is it best you don't laugh?!
Is it best you don't cry?!
Is it best you don't sneeze?!

16:46.106 --> 16:50.608
Is there a heart in that chest
of yours, Hector?!
'Cause if there is, let it beat,

16:50.610 --> 16:53.678
man!
Let it beat!
>> Darwin: That's his toe.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.983

her or not?!

up with it!

[ Sobbing ]
>> Calm down, honey!
Try your breathing technique!

17:18.605 --> 17:22.040
>> That's boring, too!
>> What have you done to my
son?!

17:22.042 --> 17:26.544
>> Gumball: Improved his life.
>> What's the one thing you know
about giants?!

17:26.546 --> 17:30.348
>> Gumball: That they're big?
>> Yes, and so are their
emotions.

17:30.350 --> 17:35.453
I wasn't making his life boring.
I was making his life calm.
You have to keep giants calm!

17:35.455 --> 17:39.090
>> Gumball: Why?
>> Because if you don't, then
that happens!

17:39.092 --> 17:42.660
>> Is this boring?!
Or is this?!
You think this is boring?!

17:42.662 --> 17:50.368

>> Darwin: Gumball, what do we
do?
We have to stop him.

18:11.157 --> 18:15.126
>> Gumball: I got it!
We'll just fly after him using
one of your witch brooms.

18:15.128 --> 18:19.397
Ohh!
>> That's a normal broomstick.
I'm a cleaning lady.

there.

>> Gumball: Aah!
What the -- ohh!

Ohh!
Do we really have to be this
high?

18:36.449 --> 18:40.551
>> Yes!
We need to be close to his head
so he'll hear the music box and

18:40.553 --> 18:45.289
fall asleep.
>> I'm not boring!
I'm not boring!

>> Gumball: For the record,
before we go on, I'd like to

apologize.
>> Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
Now I'll try to calm him down.

18:54.134 --> 18:59.971
You take the music box.
Here!
Ah, just go get it.

18:59.973 --> 19:04.709

stop this thing?

there might be a lesson in all
this.

else.
I think I'll just go back to

and trash the town.
