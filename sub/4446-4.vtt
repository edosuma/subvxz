to make this work for hours.

11:37.752 --> 11:39.252
What are you broadcasting on?

11:39.287 --> 11:42.555
Uh, Clowny the french fry guy.

11:42.557 --> 11:45.441
One of our team,
Carver jerry-rigged a drive-thru camera

11:46.060 --> 11:46.776
Addy Carver?

11:47.562 --> 11:48.611
Yeah.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.814
Is she there? I wanna say hi.

11:51.866 --> 11:53.983
Oh, okay.

11:57.205 --> 11:58.404
Hi, Addy.

11:58.406 --> 11:59.405
Hey.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.290
How's it going down there?

12:01.326 --> 12:03.910
Ummm, it's pretty eff'd up actually.

12:03.962 --> 12:06.579
How's it going wherever you are?

12:06.631 --> 12:09.582
Aww you know, same ol' same ol'.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.384
Busy keeping an eye on the world.

12:11.419 --> 12:12.752
What can I do for you folks?

12:12.754 --> 12:15.421
Can we get a chocolate shake
and fries for ten thousand men?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.757
Could we please get on with
this before the Zs find us?

12:17.759 --> 12:20.760
Wait. Is that Murphy?

12:24.015 --> 12:25.097
Outstanding.

12:25.149 --> 12:26.599
Glad to see you're still alive, sir.

12:26.651 --> 12:28.985
Yeah but he won't be for long if
we don't get off this highway.

12:29.020 --> 12:30.736
We're in desperate need
of alternate transpo.

12:30.772 --> 12:33.823
We're looking for an airplane or
a chopper or a hot air balloon.

12:33.858 --> 12:34.824
Anything airborne.

12:34.859 --> 12:36.909
There is one thing.

12:36.945 --> 12:38.444
I've been monitoring
some random transmissions

12:38.446 --> 12:39.579
from what's left of the

12:39.614 --> 12:42.081
Emergency Headquarters
for Infection Control.

12:42.116 --> 12:44.450
I can hear them,
but they don't respond when I reply.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.668
And it's pretty garbled.

12:45.703 --> 12:48.588
General McCandles might
still be holed up there.

12:50.792 --> 12:51.624
You're in luck.

12:52.627 --> 12:54.210
I have a visual confirmation
on that chopper.

12:54.262 --> 12:55.428
It looks like it's still there.

12:55.463 --> 12:56.879
(Garnett) Where is it?

12:56.931 --> 13:00.516
McLean, Virginia.
Twenty clicks due west of Washington DC.

13:00.551 --> 13:02.468
Look for a high-rise with structural damage

13:02.470 --> 13:03.803
and a chopper on the roof.

13:03.855 --> 13:05.855
Now that's a hundred miles south from here.

13:05.890 --> 13:06.889
We're going west, not south.

13:06.941 --> 13:09.308
West. Do you want to
get off the road or not?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.476
- Puppies and kittens!
- [zombies snarling]

13:10.528 --> 13:11.560
We gotta go.

13:11.613 --> 13:12.645
Bye, Addison.

13:12.647 --> 13:15.147
Call me when you get there.

13:15.149 --> 13:19.151
- [vehicle engine running] 
- [zombies snarling]

13:19.153 --> 13:21.487
[snarling]

13:48.933 --> 13:50.349
Not exactly what I was hoping for.

13:50.401 --> 13:52.818
One of these days you're gonna
learn to quit hoping for things.

13:52.854 --> 13:54.020
You better hope not

13:54.072 --> 13:57.323
cuz that's when we leave your
ass at the side of the road.

14:00.028 --> 14:02.244
Halt! Who goes there!

14:02.280 --> 14:04.580
Sergeant Charles Garnett, National Guard.

14:04.615 --> 14:06.198
This is Lieutenant Roberta Warren,

14:06.200 --> 14:08.334
- State your business.
- also National Guard.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.669
We're on a high priority mission

14:09.704 --> 14:13.005
to get this man to a CDC lab in California.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.374
We were sent here by an
Intell Officer from the NSA

14:15.426 --> 14:17.043
to see General McCandles.

14:17.095 --> 14:19.045
We need his help finding transpo.

14:19.097 --> 14:20.880
We were told he has a helicopter.

14:20.882 --> 14:23.099
Yeah, he's got a chopper.

14:23.134 --> 14:24.967
But General McCandles is a very busy man.

14:25.019 --> 14:26.552
He's got the entire east
coast under his command.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.721
He can't worry about some
raggedy ass group of civilians

14:28.773 --> 14:30.222
on a suicide mission.

14:30.274 --> 14:33.609
I suggest you move on before
the infected find you.

14:33.644 --> 14:37.229
Nothing raggedy ass about
this group of civilians, sir.

14:37.231 --> 14:38.564
And this man has important information

14:38.616 --> 14:42.284
about a vaccine for the zombie virus.

14:57.051 --> 14:58.667
He smells like a damn Z.

14:59.387 --> 15:02.471
You don't smell so good yourself,
septic tank.

15:03.141 --> 15:05.591
You gonna help us or not?

15:05.593 --> 15:07.977
You want to see the General?

15:08.012 --> 15:09.645
You're going to have to pay a tribute.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.314
Gesture of goodwill to
show him you're serious.

15:12.350 --> 15:14.350
What kind of tribute you have in mind?

15:14.402 --> 15:16.485
Our medic has been MIA over a year.

15:16.521 --> 15:19.105
We need painkillers. Antibiotics.

15:19.107 --> 15:21.240
Anything you got.

15:23.745 --> 15:25.444
I'll get my bag.

15:27.081 --> 15:30.082
I got aspirin, tetracycline, cipro.

15:30.118 --> 15:33.085
That should knock out most any infection.

15:35.173 --> 15:36.422
And oxycontin.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.008
The oxy. We need painkillers.

15:48.352 --> 15:50.469
You want to see the General or not?

15:51.139 --> 15:54.473
This is the last of our supply.

15:58.029 --> 15:59.278
That'll do.

15:59.313 --> 16:00.312
Hey!

16:10.491 --> 16:12.491
[exhaling loudly]

16:16.914 --> 16:19.215
The General will see you now.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.167
(Radio) Why are you wasting my time?

16:21.219 --> 16:22.501
General McCandles, sir.

16:22.503 --> 16:25.504
We have a National Guard
unit and several civilians

16:25.556 --> 16:27.256
requesting permission to speak to you.

16:27.308 --> 16:28.257
Is sweet Jesus with them?

16:28.309 --> 16:29.341
No, sir.

16:29.393 --> 16:30.843
- Then tell them to go to hell!
- I don't believe so.

16:30.845 --> 16:33.512
I've got a war to fight!
Where's that close air support I ordered

16:33.564 --> 16:36.732
Tell the Admiral I need those
subs in position by 0800.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.318
Bravo Company,
hold your position at all costs.

16:39.353 --> 16:41.403
Repeat, all costs.

16:41.772 --> 16:43.272
You heard the General.

16:43.658 --> 16:44.740
General McCandles, sir.

16:44.775 --> 16:47.526
We're on a mission of extreme importance

16:47.528 --> 16:50.613
by direct order from the president.

16:50.665 --> 16:53.282
It's imperative that we find air
transport to Mt. Wilson CDC lab

16:53.334 --> 16:54.583
- Sorry, I'm busy.
- in California.

16:54.619 --> 16:56.202
Where are my reinforcements?

16:56.237 --> 16:57.703
You heard the man. Time to go.

16:57.705 --> 16:59.672
That's it?

16:59.707 --> 17:02.541
I've a good mind to make
you barf up my oxycontin.

17:02.593 --> 17:03.876
Doc! Doc! Stand down!

17:03.928 --> 17:06.545
Did you say Doc? As in doctor?

17:08.348 --> 17:10.015
Yeah, our team includes a medical doctor.

17:10.050 --> 17:11.717
Why didn't you say so? Send him up.

17:11.769 --> 17:14.936
I have a wounded man in
need of medical attention.

17:16.607 --> 17:20.276
Just the doctor. The rest of you wait here.

17:21.279 --> 17:22.895
I got this.

17:22.946 --> 17:23.896
All right.

17:23.948 --> 17:27.066
Hey, hey, hey.
Talk to him about the chopper.

17:28.069 --> 17:29.401
[elevator bell dings]

17:41.249 --> 17:43.165
Son of a bitch.

17:43.217 --> 17:46.418
I was saving that oxy for a
party when we got to Cali.

17:49.056 --> 17:50.389
[elevator bell dings]

17:53.094 --> 17:54.226
You the medic?

17:54.262 --> 17:56.295
I am indeed.

17:56.330 --> 17:56.929
You the General?

17:58.099 --> 18:00.266
General Arthur C. McCandles.
Commander, Central Command,

18:00.268 --> 18:02.818
Infection Response Forces.

18:09.694 --> 18:11.410
Where's your wounded man?

18:13.364 --> 18:15.180
Right here.

18:23.507 --> 18:25.291
It's not a bite.

18:26.344 --> 18:28.510
This looks bad.

18:28.546 --> 18:30.012
Real bad.

18:30.047 --> 18:32.381
It's just a scratch.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.467
No, that's... that's more like gangrene.

18:36.671 --> 18:38.387
Can you save the leg?

18:38.439 --> 18:39.872
I'm afraid not, General.

18:39.907 --> 18:41.640
It's already starting to spread.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.476
Soon the Z virus will take over.

18:44.528 --> 18:46.946
All I can do at this point is show you mercy

18:46.981 --> 18:48.447
when the time comes.

18:49.150 --> 18:51.150
You call that a diagnosis?

18:51.786 --> 18:54.353
I call it the truth.

18:54.388 --> 18:55.654
You're gonna die.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.156
And soon.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.624
That's what the last guy said.

18:59.293 --> 18:59.725
[punch]

18:59.760 --> 19:00.793
[yells]

19:03.831 --> 19:07.166
[screaming]

19:07.218 --> 19:09.668
[screaming] Oh! Oh!

19:09.720 --> 19:19.428
[breathing heavily]

19:21.232 --> 19:21.680
[gasp]

19:23.100 --> 19:23.599
[snarling]

19:23.651 --> 19:24.900
[breathing heavily]

19:25.486 --> 19:31.690
- [zombie growling]
- [Doc screaming]

19:42.096 --> 19:43.429
What do you think, pup?

19:43.464 --> 19:44.630
Could we use another friend?

19:44.682 --> 19:45.715
[panting]

19:46.768 --> 19:48.050
My thoughts exactly.

19:52.523 --> 19:53.889
That was quick.

19:53.925 --> 19:56.809
(Addy) How are things at the North Pole?

19:56.861 --> 20:01.397
Awesome. Beautiful Aurora today.
How's your day going?

20:01.399 --> 20:04.867
Kinda lonely.
Nice to have somebody to talk to.

20:04.902 --> 20:08.154
I know the feeling. Gets lonely here too.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.539
Keeping an eye on the planet
keeps you busy though.

20:10.575 --> 20:15.244
I feel safer just knowing you're there.
You seem so cool.

20:15.246 --> 20:16.912
I wish I could meet you in person.

20:16.964 --> 20:21.083
Super busy,
but I'm sure that could be arranged.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.086
What are you doing right now?

20:27.091 --> 20:28.341
Aww you know.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.759
Same ol', same ol'.

20:35.066 --> 20:35.564
[gunshot]

20:36.267 --> 20:37.817
One thousand ninety.

20:37.852 --> 20:38.351
[gunshot]

20:39.070 --> 20:40.519
One thousand ninety-one.

20:40.571 --> 20:41.070
[gunshot]

20:42.023 --> 20:43.773
One thousand and ninety-two.

20:43.775 --> 20:44.990
[slice]

20:48.029 --> 20:49.495
Okay, what's going on with Doc?

20:49.530 --> 20:52.048
Guys, if we don't get out of
here soon this could get ugly.

20:52.083 --> 20:52.882
Oh, you mean uglier.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.350
<i>[screaming]</i>

20:54.385 --> 20:55.368
Do you hear that?

20:56.120 --> 20:56.952
Hear what?

20:57.121 --> 20:57.953
I don't hear anything.

20:57.955 --> 20:59.455
Shhh.

20:59.457 --> 21:04.093
<i>[screaming]</i>

21:04.128 --> 21:05.044
Sounds like Doc.

21:05.096 --> 21:11.717
- [zombie growling]
- [Doc screaming]

21:11.769 --> 21:12.768
Make it stop!

21:12.804 --> 21:13.636
Make it stop!

21:13.721 --> 21:14.804
<i>[screaming continues]</i>

21:14.856 --> 21:17.139
That's Doc all right.
But where the hell is he?

21:17.141 --> 21:18.274
Somewhere up there.

21:18.309 --> 21:19.308
We're going up after him.

21:19.677 --> 21:21.193
No, you don't.

21:21.229 --> 21:22.311
Let us up now.

21:22.313 --> 21:25.481
Nobody goes upstairs without
the General's orders.

21:26.317 --> 21:27.283
We go up now

21:27.318 --> 21:31.036
or I scramble your
egg-brain inside the shell.

21:35.209 --> 21:36.459
You'll be sorry.

21:36.494 --> 21:39.712
So will you cuz you're coming up with us.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.214
10K! Cover our flank.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.049
Don't let man or zombie follow us up.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.501
Yes, sir.

21:49.924 --> 21:51.724
One thousand ninety-three.

21:51.759 --> 21:52.258
[gunshot]

21:53.561 --> 21:54.727
No.

21:55.763 --> 21:57.012
Ninety-four.

22:02.186 --> 22:03.436
[elevator bell dings]

22:04.272 --> 22:06.522
What floor is the General on?

22:06.524 --> 22:07.690
Top floor.

22:07.742 --> 22:11.193
He's the General, man.
What floor do you think he's on?

22:11.195 --> 22:24.206
- [zombie growling]
- [Doc meditating]

22:24.208 --> 22:25.925
My world is but an illusion.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.593
My world is but an illusion.

22:27.628 --> 22:30.262
Oh God, why didn't I pay better attention

22:30.298 --> 22:32.097
to that sweet little Buddhist chick I dated?

22:32.133 --> 22:35.184
- [zombie continues growling]
- [Doc breathes heavily]

22:35.219 --> 22:36.385
Stay calm.

22:36.387 --> 22:38.471
I'm sure they're...
I'm sure they're watching you right now.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.472
They're looking for you.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.639
They're looking for you right now.

22:40.691 --> 22:42.608
There's no way they'd just leave you here

22:42.643 --> 22:45.528
trapped in the air shaft
with an ugly-ass zombie

22:45.563 --> 22:47.897
waiting to eat my face off!

22:47.899 --> 22:49.732
[growling continues]

22:49.784 --> 22:50.616
Oh, wait.

22:50.651 --> 22:54.069
[growling continues]

22:54.071 --> 22:54.570
Oh.

22:54.622 --> 22:56.071
[sniffing]

22:56.073 --> 22:56.956
Oh, that's more like it.

22:56.991 --> 22:59.241
I was saving this for a special occasion.

22:59.293 --> 23:00.793
[growling continues]

23:00.828 --> 23:02.495
Like now.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.497
[growling continues]

23:04.549 --> 23:09.919
[growling intensifies]

23:09.971 --> 23:14.723
Come on, suck it up. Come on. Come on.

23:14.759 --> 23:17.059
[growling continues]

23:17.094 --> 23:19.061
That's good shit, man.

23:19.096 --> 23:20.229
Chill!

23:20.264 --> 23:23.182

23:29.023 --> 23:30.489
Now what?

23:31.192 --> 23:32.741
Be ready for anything.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.410
Did I mention that

23:34.445 --> 23:38.614
the one thing I have a phobia of
aside from zombies is elevators.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.783
Shouldn't have messed with the General.

23:41.869 --> 23:44.537
[breathing heavily] Is
it getting hot in here?

23:45.256 --> 23:47.456
Hey, come on. Open the damn door.

23:47.508 --> 23:48.340
I got to get out of here.

23:48.376 --> 23:49.425
Relax, Murphy.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.860
No, no, I got to get out.
There's not enough oxygen.

23:52.213 --> 23:52.628
[slap]

23:52.680 --> 23:53.596
Chill out!

23:56.851 --> 23:57.466
Mack!

23:57.518 --> 23:58.467
I'm here, babe.

23:59.270 --> 24:01.353
Hey, why aren't we moving?

24:01.389 --> 24:03.105

24:40.928 --> 24:45.014

24:45.349 --> 24:47.766
Can I do anything for you?

24:48.152 --> 24:50.235
Make sure those knots are tight.

24:51.989 --> 24:55.407
It's not gonna be long now.

24:55.776 --> 24:57.409
It's double-half-hitch.
Just like you taught me.

24:57.745 --> 24:59.078
Just be sure.

25:01.699 --> 25:03.449
Promise me

25:03.834 --> 25:05.918
you'll do what we talked about

25:06.304 --> 25:08.337
when the time comes.

25:10.791 --> 25:13.509
Promise me.

25:13.878 --> 25:15.210
I promise.

25:15.546 --> 25:18.097
Just like we talked about.

25:18.849 --> 25:20.349
I swear.

25:21.385 --> 25:23.385
Don't swear.

25:23.721 --> 25:27.189
Your mother never liked that.

25:29.193 --> 25:30.726
I promise.

25:31.195 --> 25:33.646
[whispering] Good.

25:34.031 --> 25:38.400
[whispering] I could always
trust you to do the right thing.

25:43.791 --> 25:45.991
[crying] You're a good boy.

25:48.963 --> 25:49.962
[crying] Your mother,

25:49.997 --> 25:54.350
she'd be proud of the man
you're growing up to be.

25:54.385 --> 25:58.887
[crying]

25:58.923 --> 26:01.056
Give me another puff.

26:15.823 --> 26:16.338
[gunshot]

26:28.883 --> 26:32.135
Ya know, now don't take offense.

26:32.187 --> 26:36.973
But the only thing worse
than that mug of yours

26:37.025 --> 26:38.274
is your breath.

26:38.309 --> 26:42.361
[growling continues]

26:42.397 --> 26:43.029
[roar]

26:43.064 --> 26:45.031
Not my fingers, you animal!

26:45.066 --> 26:47.233
I was offering you the last hit.

26:47.285 --> 26:50.236
Well, fine. I'll bogart it myself then.

26:50.288 --> 26:53.039

27:03.218 --> 27:04.967
Well I'll be damned.

27:05.003 --> 27:06.886
I think you're stoned.

27:06.921 --> 27:08.421
[laughs]

27:08.423 --> 27:10.590
Hell, we don't need a vaccine.

27:10.592 --> 27:13.926
Just need a few billion
tons of some primo Ganja,

27:13.978 --> 27:15.978
and the world would be just fine.

27:16.014 --> 27:17.096
[laughs]

27:17.148 --> 27:18.147
[gasps]

27:20.602 --> 27:30.109
[lesser growling continues]

27:30.445 --> 27:32.111
Doctor Morgan Henley.

27:32.163 --> 27:34.313
Does that name ring a bell

27:34.349 --> 27:38.701
in any of those cannabinol
soaked brain cells you have left

27:38.753 --> 27:40.620
[snarls]

27:42.841 --> 27:45.124
I must be really stoned.

27:46.845 --> 27:48.377
Obstetrics, huh?

27:48.429 --> 27:51.130
I wonder what that must have been like.

27:51.466 --> 27:55.885
Bringing all them beautiful
little angels into the world.

27:55.937 --> 28:00.690
I mean just to be present
for so many miracles.

28:00.725 --> 28:03.359
Yeah, it's a bummer all those
babies grew up to be zombies.

28:03.394 --> 28:07.196
[growling resumes]

28:07.232 --> 28:08.364
You know,

28:08.399 --> 28:11.117
I got a kid out there somewhere.

28:12.620 --> 28:15.655
I never told anybody that before.

28:15.707 --> 28:18.491
I had him when I was 19.

28:18.543 --> 28:20.576
Too young.

28:20.628 --> 28:23.830
Wasn't really around for
him like I should've been.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.965
Never really got to know him.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.083
[growling continues]

28:27.135 --> 28:29.635
Kept telling myself maybe you know

28:29.671 --> 28:33.389
someday I... I would just call him up.

28:33.775 --> 28:35.842
Make up for lost time.

28:38.730 --> 28:41.063
[crying] Lost time. Lost time.

28:41.099 --> 28:42.598
[growling continues]

28:43.451 --> 28:46.485
[crying] And I don't even
know if he's alive or dead.

28:46.521 --> 28:52.775
[crying]

28:53.417 --> 28:55.451
Help!

28:55.503 --> 28:56.118

[growling intensifies]

28:57.621 --> 28:59.087
Somebody!

28:59.123 --> 29:00.622
Anybody!

29:00.674 --> 29:01.173
Help!

29:02.092 --> 29:03.509
Bravo Company must hold their positions

29:03.544 --> 29:06.211
until the reinforcements arrive.
If their line is broken,

29:06.263 --> 29:07.713
there's nothing to stop the infected

29:07.765 --> 29:08.630
between here and the ocean.

29:08.849 --> 29:09.932
You tell that wing commander

29:09.967 --> 29:11.934
if he doesn't get those
planes in the air right now

29:12.052 --> 29:14.052
I'm gonna come down there personally

29:14.104 --> 29:16.054
and tear his head off his shoulders

29:16.106 --> 29:20.342
and beat the damn zombie horde
to death with his bloody skull.

29:23.531 --> 29:25.647
Well, well, well.

29:25.699 --> 29:27.533
What do we have here?

29:28.652 --> 29:32.070
Insubordinate curs can't
take no for an answer?

29:32.122 --> 29:33.622
We'll see about that, eh?

29:35.326 --> 29:36.825
- Why aren't we moving?
- What's going on?

29:36.877 --> 29:38.327
All right, everyone needs to relax.

29:38.379 --> 29:39.912
Don't mess with us.

29:39.964 --> 29:42.047
I'm not messing with you, man.

29:45.503 --> 29:48.003
Anything happens, you'll be the first to go.

36:45.186 --> 36:47.219
I'll fly you there myself.

36:49.223 --> 36:50.606
She's beautiful, isn't she?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.775
What is this, some kind of joke?

36:53.127 --> 36:55.728
Sure, she needs a little maintenance. But,

36:55.780 --> 36:57.697
with some TLC,

36:57.732 --> 36:59.699
a little help scrounging a few spare parts,

36:59.734 --> 37:01.567
I'll have you to California in no time.

37:01.619 --> 37:02.151
Jackass!

37:02.203 --> 37:03.319
Hey.

37:03.371 --> 37:05.204
A friend of mine died trying
to get to that pile of junk.

37:05.239 --> 37:06.539
You and Doc were friends?

37:06.574 --> 37:08.908
We played cards... once.

37:08.910 --> 37:10.743
This is war, son.

37:10.745 --> 37:12.411
We've all lost friends.

37:12.413 --> 37:13.963
Hell, everybody I ever knew is dead.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.665
Why am I not surprised?

37:15.717 --> 37:16.832
You know I don't like you.

37:16.884 --> 37:17.833
Well get in line.

37:17.885 --> 37:18.718
General McCandles.

37:18.753 --> 37:20.970
Sir.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.556
Thank you, but I think we'll
find alternate transportation.

37:23.591 --> 37:26.225
You think I'm insane, don't you?

37:30.431 --> 37:33.733
Well maybe I am.

37:34.435 --> 37:37.103
Too much death.

37:37.155 --> 37:40.239
Too many good men sent to an early grave.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.945
Too many zombies.

37:45.947 --> 37:48.531
[growling]

37:48.583 --> 37:50.750
Stand down! I got this!

37:50.785 --> 37:54.587
Come here you Godless brain eating scum!

37:54.622 --> 37:56.539
- [General yelling]
- [several gunshots]

37:56.591 --> 37:59.091
I'll see you in Hell!

37:59.127 --> 38:01.711
[gunshots]

38:01.763 --> 38:02.595
[crash]

38:11.916 --> 38:14.583
What happened to Doc?

38:17.972 --> 38:19.555
He didn't make it.

38:26.664 --> 38:28.481
Zombies.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.683
Oh, whoa, whoa.

38:31.936 --> 38:34.069
Oh God, is that...

38:34.605 --> 38:35.988
It's Doc.

38:42.947 --> 38:44.280
Someone's gotta...

38:44.282 --> 38:45.314
I'll do it.

38:48.019 --> 38:51.704
Steven "Doc" Beck.

38:51.756 --> 38:57.209
I give you mercy.

39:01.899 --> 39:02.381
[gunshot]

39:02.633 --> 39:04.066
What the hell, Warren?

39:04.101 --> 39:05.718
You trying to kill me?

39:07.221 --> 39:08.337
You're alive?

39:08.372 --> 39:09.939
Damn straight I'm alive.

39:09.974 --> 39:11.207
[laughing]

39:14.145 --> 39:15.311
We thought you were dead.

39:15.363 --> 39:17.112
Well so did I.

39:17.148 --> 39:21.901
Some numbskull threw a grenade
in the air shaft I was stuck in.

39:21.953 --> 39:23.118
[laughing]

39:24.572 --> 39:25.488
Well hurry up!

39:25.540 --> 39:26.155
Here.

39:26.207 --> 39:27.373
[laughing] Come on.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.657
Give me a kiss, baby.

39:28.709 --> 39:32.261
[laughing]

39:38.603 --> 39:40.586
Well I should let you go.

39:40.638 --> 39:41.921
I'm sure you're busy with

39:41.973 --> 39:46.175
keeping an eye on the world and all.

39:46.227 --> 39:47.593
Yeah.

39:47.645 --> 39:50.596
I got a hungry dog here I better go feed.

39:50.648 --> 39:52.515
Nice talking to you.

39:52.567 --> 39:54.483
I hope we get to meet someday.

39:57.071 --> 39:58.938
I'd really like that.

39:58.990 --> 39:59.989
Good night.

40:01.692 --> 40:05.027
Sweet prince.

40:05.696 --> 40:08.747
Good night, fair lady.

40:11.335 --> 40:20.759
[music plays]

40:20.795 --> 40:23.546
Here's a song for all the
lonely people out there,

40:23.598 --> 40:26.465
which is just about everybody that's left.

40:26.517 --> 40:29.051
So if you've got somebody to
go through the Apocalypse with,

40:29.053 --> 40:31.887
you better watch their backs.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.356
Cuz there ain't many of us left.

40:35.059 --> 40:36.892
And oh yeah,

40:36.894 --> 40:41.130
I'd like to dedicate this
song to Addison Carver,

40:41.165 --> 40:43.699
wherever you are.

40:43.985 --> 40:47.570
(Radio) I'd like to dedicate
this song to Addison Carver,

40:47.622 --> 40:50.406
wherever you are.

40:50.408 --> 40:55.244
I talked to the guy twice. Come on.

40:58.583 --> 41:00.649
You know kid,

41:00.685 --> 41:03.919
I've been thinking about what
you told me about your dad

41:03.971 --> 41:07.256
and how you wished he knew
you did the right thing

41:07.308 --> 41:09.592
giving him mercy like you promised.

41:09.594 --> 41:10.426
Yeah?

41:11.762 --> 41:14.830
Well I just want you to know

41:14.865 --> 41:17.066
your dad knows what you did for him.

41:17.101 --> 41:21.654
And he knows you did the right thing.
You kept your promise.

41:23.908 --> 41:25.357
Thanks.

41:28.996 --> 41:39.038
[snarling and heavy breathing]

41:39.040 --> 41:47.496
[snarling and heavy breathing]

41:47.531 --> 41:50.716
I'm sorry, papa.

41:50.768 --> 41:55.688
[snarling and heavy breathing]

41:55.723 --> 41:58.474
I love you.

42:01.696 --> 42:05.147
[snarling ceases]

42:05.199 --> 42:15.240
[crying]

42:15.242 --> 42:21.997
[crying]
