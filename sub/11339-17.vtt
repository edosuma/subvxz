00:02.204 --> 00:03.792
Ian Doyle vanished from prison.

00:04.014 --> 00:05.076
Interpol can't find him.

00:05.111 --> 00:05.934
Am I in danger?

00:06.002 --> 00:07.402
We all are.

00:07.470 --> 00:08.904
As far as Doyle is concerned,

00:08.971 --> 00:11.206
Lauren Reynolds died
in a car accident.

00:11.274 --> 00:12.974
You died and we're all good.

00:13.042 --> 00:14.976
How did he
get past security checks?

00:15.044 --> 00:16.044
He chartered a private jet.

00:16.111 --> 00:18.046
He used an alias.
He sent me flowers,

00:18.097 --> 00:21.116
so I think it's safe
to assume he's coming here.

00:21.184 --> 00:22.417
Hello, Lauren.

00:22.485 --> 00:25.921
Oh, wait. Lauren Reynolds
died in a car accident,

00:25.988 --> 00:26.955
didn't she?

00:27.023 --> 00:28.590
I was doing my job.

00:28.658 --> 00:30.892
You took the only thing
that mattered to me.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.495
So I'm going to take the only
thing that matters to you...

00:33.563 --> 00:34.596
your life.

01:12.134 --> 01:15.737
A strong storm is expected
to hit the eastern seaboard

01:15.788 --> 01:17.305
within the next 72 hours.

01:17.373 --> 01:18.406
Could be a bad one.

01:18.457 --> 01:19.624
Let's see how it's looking
right now.

01:19.709 --> 01:21.643
Now, what we have
is an area of low pressure

01:21.711 --> 01:25.580
that's getting stronger and
moving off the eastern seaboard.

01:25.648 --> 01:27.349
Then comes the fear
of damage...

01:27.416 --> 01:29.184
5:30 on the dot, as promised.

01:29.252 --> 01:31.186
And at the same time,
another heavy snowfall event

01:31.254 --> 01:34.723
will create travel chaos and power
outages throughout the district.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.890
Cold air moves in...

01:35.958 --> 01:40.595
Getting ready for the storm.
Can you believe it?

01:47.837 --> 01:50.338
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:54.543 --> 01:56.278
Don't make me come and get you.

02:10.459 --> 02:12.861
I used to fit into this.

02:12.928 --> 02:14.829
I blame your cooking.

02:14.897 --> 02:18.233
It's just too damn fine.

02:18.301 --> 02:19.551
Like your ass.

02:19.635 --> 02:21.403
Now let's go.
We're late.

02:26.976 --> 02:30.779
Frank? Honey, you ok?

02:32.848 --> 02:35.050
Frank?

02:35.117 --> 02:36.685
Frank!

03:59.268 --> 04:02.237
I love you.

04:17.019 --> 04:20.321
Please, please, my family
has done nothing to you.

04:20.389 --> 04:23.475
Please, I beg you.
Why are you doing this?

04:23.559 --> 04:27.061
Please, my son.
My son. Let my son go.

04:27.129 --> 04:29.130
He's innocent.

04:49.251 --> 04:51.352
Good evening.

04:51.420 --> 04:55.357
Luckily for you I'm
not working for Doyle.

04:55.387 --> 04:57.075
We got on three stops ago.

04:57.110 --> 04:57.759
We?

05:01.464 --> 05:03.331
You ok?

05:04.333 --> 05:07.101
Ian Doyle is here in DC.

05:07.169 --> 05:08.436
How can you be so sure?

05:08.504 --> 05:10.939
I sat next to him last night.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.907
What?

05:12.975 --> 05:16.561
He said if I warned my team or
told anyone, he'd kill them.

05:16.645 --> 05:17.879
Why didn't he kill you?

05:17.947 --> 05:20.698
And more to the point,
why didn't you kill him?

05:20.783 --> 05:22.283
He's not working alone.

05:22.351 --> 05:23.985
Then he's just
playing with you.

05:24.053 --> 05:27.255
No, no, he's a power assertive psychopath.
He doesn't play games.

05:27.323 --> 05:30.925
He's meticulous. He plans
everything down to the last detail.

05:30.993 --> 05:32.894
Yeah, that last detail
being you.

05:32.962 --> 05:35.263
Maybe you should
tell your team.

05:35.331 --> 05:37.966
No. No way.
This isn't their fight.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.467
And I won't take that risk.

05:39.535 --> 05:41.936
We stay together,
we can get him.

05:42.004 --> 05:44.422
We already tried.

05:44.507 --> 05:45.890
Look how that ended up.

05:45.975 --> 05:48.443
Wait. Wait. When you
went undercover,

05:48.511 --> 05:51.079
I promised no one
would harm you.

05:51.146 --> 05:53.581
I'm not undercover anymore.

05:53.649 --> 05:57.118
DC isn't his comfort
zone, it's mine.

05:57.186 --> 05:58.887
This ends here.

06:43.232 --> 06:46.484
Two dc homes torched,
two families, on the same night,

06:46.569 --> 06:47.702
last night.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.337
I'm surprised it still
hasn't hit the news.

06:49.405 --> 06:50.572
It's already mid-day.

06:50.639 --> 06:51.806
Yeah. All anyone's
talking about

06:51.874 --> 06:53.992
is this storm
that may or may not hit.

06:54.076 --> 06:56.544
I managed to find an online
article about the fires

06:56.612 --> 06:57.912
written by this guy
Jeff Hastings,

06:57.963 --> 06:59.514
but no one's running with it.

06:59.582 --> 07:02.050
How strange.
They usually thrive on tragedy.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.718
Yeah, and it gets weirder.

07:03.786 --> 07:05.386
Ron and Lauren Cosenza
and their 10-year-old son

07:05.454 --> 07:06.588
were found in the master
bedroom of their home,

07:06.655 --> 07:07.989
each shot through the forehead.

07:08.057 --> 07:09.857
The gun belonged to the father.

07:09.925 --> 07:11.426
Murder-suicide?

07:11.493 --> 07:13.595
Well, it looks like Metro PD's
investigation is going that way,

07:13.662 --> 07:16.064
but it's still the first 48.
They want our help.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.365
Kerry and Frank Fagan,
like the Cosenzas,

07:17.433 --> 07:18.566
were found in
their master bedroom

07:18.634 --> 07:20.101
from a suspected gas leak.

07:20.169 --> 07:21.853
It had to be massive
to cause that.

07:21.937 --> 07:24.539
How does the news miss
a house explosion?

07:24.607 --> 07:26.207
Any connection
between the families?

07:26.275 --> 07:27.742
Only one. A continent.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.193
Kerry Fagan was born
in Germany,

07:29.278 --> 07:30.712
Ron Cosenza is from Italy.

07:30.779 --> 07:33.514
So 2 of the 5 victims are from Europe.
How does that help?

07:33.582 --> 07:36.551
It doesn't. I'm just stating the
facts, and the facts happen to be...

07:36.619 --> 07:38.252
guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.787
You ok?

07:39.838 --> 07:41.422
Yeah, it's just one of
those weeks, I guess.

07:41.490 --> 07:44.292
I'm sorry. What did
I miss? Arsonist?

07:44.360 --> 07:46.894
One appears to be murder-suicide,
the other a freak accident.

07:46.962 --> 07:48.546
So why are we looking at it?

07:48.631 --> 07:50.832
House fires are rare.
Add to that a few Miles apart,

07:50.899 --> 07:52.900
within the same hour,

07:52.968 --> 07:54.602
kind of tips the scales
of coincidence.

07:54.670 --> 07:57.572
Yeah, if somebody did this, they're
highly motivated and organized.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.974
And if he wants to strike
again, he's got 72 hours

08:00.042 --> 08:02.193
before the storm
shuts the city down.

08:07.416 --> 08:08.349
Hey.

08:08.417 --> 08:09.350
Hey.

08:09.418 --> 08:10.485
What's his name?

08:10.552 --> 08:12.453
I'm sorry?

08:12.521 --> 08:15.156
Oh, answering a question with a question.
That's interesting.

08:15.224 --> 08:16.157
Stop it.

08:16.225 --> 08:17.158
Stop what, probing?

08:17.226 --> 08:18.576
Seriously.

08:18.661 --> 08:19.594
I'm gonna make it
my life's work

08:19.662 --> 08:20.928
to find out who this boy is...

08:20.996 --> 08:23.097
stop. Just stop.

08:23.165 --> 08:25.533
We have enough to worry
about already, don't we?

08:42.676 --> 08:45.568
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

09:14.771 --> 09:18.841
Lao Tzu said,
"when I let go of what I am,

09:18.908 --> 09:22.127
I become what I might be."

09:22.212 --> 09:23.345
Ok, thanks.

09:23.413 --> 09:26.181
That was weird.
They're not coming.

09:26.249 --> 09:28.517
There was some mix-up
with Metro pd

09:28.585 --> 09:30.185
and we're on our own.

09:30.253 --> 09:31.520
What do you got?

09:31.588 --> 09:33.355
Well, the fire didn't spread

09:33.423 --> 09:35.224
because they had
hard-wired smoke alarms

09:35.275 --> 09:37.977
and a sprinkler system.

09:38.061 --> 09:39.778
What's with the security.

09:39.863 --> 09:42.698
Why the steel door?
What did he do for a living?

09:42.766 --> 09:44.366
Oh, computer networking,

09:44.434 --> 09:47.269
and the Fagans were
financial advisors.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.204
These neighborhoods
don't require anything

09:49.272 --> 09:50.706
more than an average deadbolt,

09:50.774 --> 09:53.208
certainly nothing
on the bedroom doors.

09:53.276 --> 09:54.710
It's like a panic room.

09:54.778 --> 09:57.079
Yeah, but there's nothing
in this room that's high tech.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.666
There's no surveillance cameras,
average alarm system.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.167
In an average area.

10:02.252 --> 10:05.587
But he had a 40-caliber
and a load of locks.

10:05.655 --> 10:07.890
What was this guy afraid of?

10:07.957 --> 10:09.858
Or who.

10:09.926 --> 10:10.993
Maybe himself.

10:11.061 --> 10:13.996
If he actually
killed his family,

10:14.064 --> 10:15.497
then he's been hiding something.

10:20.470 --> 10:23.188
There is no history of any kind
of psychological weirdness

10:23.273 --> 10:24.406
with either family.

10:24.474 --> 10:26.608
They were healthy, happy, fit.

10:26.676 --> 10:27.609
Until last night.

10:27.677 --> 10:29.578
Any signs of financial stress?

10:29.645 --> 10:32.081
No. They were healthy
on that front, too.

10:32.148 --> 10:33.248
What's with the...

10:33.316 --> 10:34.583
Oh. The heat is out
in my lair.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.085
Not a single snowflake
has fallen

10:36.152 --> 10:37.820
and yet the weather remains
the top news story.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.154
Nothing about these cases?

10:39.222 --> 10:40.989
No. They're bound
to get hip to it.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.657
Once our presence is felt
and we connect the cases,

10:42.709 --> 10:44.326
it'll be a ballroom blitz.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.761
What is it?

10:45.828 --> 10:47.429
You know, considering the time
these fires occurred,

10:47.497 --> 10:49.098
the habitual patterns
of both families

10:49.165 --> 10:51.600
were in direct conflict with
where the bodies were found.

10:51.668 --> 10:52.768
The master bedroom.

10:52.836 --> 10:54.069
Yeah, normally Lauren Cosenza
would be downstairs

10:54.137 --> 10:55.404
helping her son
with his homework,

10:55.472 --> 10:57.005
and Ron wouldn't even
be home from work yet.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.006
What about the Fagans?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.074
Their routines were less
established.

10:59.142 --> 11:00.542
They traveled a lot.
But they were expected

11:00.610 --> 11:01.777
at a dinner party last night.

11:01.845 --> 11:04.680
If someone did this,
what are the chances

11:04.748 --> 11:06.515
these victims are random?

11:09.319 --> 11:10.652
What do you think?

11:10.703 --> 11:14.656
Two families, same night,
mysterious deaths.

11:14.724 --> 11:15.958
Doesn't happen every day.

11:16.025 --> 11:17.993
The gas leak at the Fagan house

11:18.044 --> 11:19.495
and then the other fire
suspected to be set

11:19.562 --> 11:22.164
by Mr. Cosenza to cover
the murder-suicide.

11:22.232 --> 11:24.500
Well, I know the investigators
reported that,

11:24.567 --> 11:27.136
but it doesn't fit
with what I found.

11:28.705 --> 11:31.173
The Cosenza family didn't
have any smoke in their lungs.

11:31.241 --> 11:32.441
He killed them, set the fire,

11:32.509 --> 11:34.343
then killed himself.
That fits.

11:34.411 --> 11:37.012
He didn't have signs
of smoke inhalation either.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.181
Even though the fire started
in the master bedroom?

11:39.249 --> 11:41.517
He should have had traces
of smoke,

11:41.584 --> 11:43.085
even if it was a minute

11:43.153 --> 11:45.087
before he pulled the trigger
on himself.

11:45.155 --> 11:47.222
He was dead
when the fire started.

11:51.327 --> 11:54.430
Garcia hasn't found any
connection between the victims.

11:54.497 --> 11:55.631
There has to be one.

11:55.665 --> 11:57.399
On paper they're perfect.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.700
Everything's clean.

11:58.768 --> 12:00.969
But what happened to them
last night was anything but.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.677
You ok?

12:09.946 --> 12:12.080
People text like
it's not as intrusive

12:12.148 --> 12:15.017
as a phone call.

12:15.084 --> 12:16.819
You know, you haven't
had a vacation in a while.

12:16.886 --> 12:18.720
Weren't you talking
about Italy?

12:18.788 --> 12:20.973
My mother extended
her trip there.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.691
It wouldn't be
much of a vacation.

12:22.759 --> 12:25.327
It's a big country.

12:25.395 --> 12:26.695
Not big enough.

12:26.763 --> 12:29.765
Well, think about it.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.899
I will.

12:33.369 --> 12:36.872
And pick a place
where that thing won't work.

12:36.939 --> 12:38.540
Yeah.

12:45.215 --> 12:47.466
I'm sorry.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.051
I thought you were in there.

12:49.118 --> 12:50.052
Are you ok?

12:50.119 --> 12:51.854
Yeah, I'm... I'm...

12:51.921 --> 12:53.856
I'm sure these victims
overlap somehow.

12:53.923 --> 12:56.358
Garcia pulled their phone numbers,
but so far I can't find anything.

12:56.426 --> 12:58.894
You just jumped.

13:00.430 --> 13:04.199
I've been having these really
intense headaches lately.

13:04.267 --> 13:06.401
Have you seen a doctor?

13:06.469 --> 13:09.938
Yeah, a few. None of them have
been able to figure it out.

13:11.274 --> 13:14.142
Oh. I'm...Sorry.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.045
Does anyone know?

13:17.080 --> 13:18.413
You.

13:19.949 --> 13:21.683
I won't tell anyone.

13:21.751 --> 13:24.052
I know.
They'd just worry.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.537
Not that you're
not gonna worry,

13:25.622 --> 13:27.990
but they'll just make me
feel like a baby.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.491
You know?

13:29.559 --> 13:30.492
I do.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.727
How are you?

13:31.794 --> 13:33.011
I'm good.

13:33.096 --> 13:35.197
You've been picking
your fingernails again.

13:35.265 --> 13:36.932
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.367
You only do that
when you're stressed.

13:38.434 --> 13:40.969
It's just a bad habit.

13:45.975 --> 13:47.109
You coming?

13:47.176 --> 13:48.810
Yeah. I'll be there
in a minute.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.929
The media blitz I promised
never came.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.198
The original online article

14:10.250 --> 14:12.968
written by a one
Mr. Jeff Hastings... pulled.

14:13.035 --> 14:15.203
So with your permission, sir,
I would like to track him down

14:15.255 --> 14:16.972
and figure out what the hell
is going on.

14:17.039 --> 14:18.807
It's a small one.
What's the connection?

14:18.874 --> 14:20.776
Both families coach soccer
on the hill.

14:20.843 --> 14:22.644
The Fagans
didn't have children.

14:22.712 --> 14:24.146
No. But kerry Fagan coached
her godson's team.

14:24.213 --> 14:26.615
The two victims from Europe
were the soccer coaches.

14:26.683 --> 14:28.083
It makes sense, doesn't it?

14:28.151 --> 14:30.052
I'm beginning to think that
they've crossed paths before.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.603
I ran the victims'
phone numbers.

14:31.688 --> 14:33.055
They never contacted
each other,

14:33.122 --> 14:34.606
but there is a common
number between them.

14:34.691 --> 14:35.791
Give it.

14:35.858 --> 14:38.193
Uh, 703-555-0118.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.630
Byron Delaney, his wife grace
died last summer,

14:41.698 --> 14:42.614
children grown.

14:42.699 --> 14:44.366
What do you know?
He's British.

14:44.434 --> 14:46.335
Garcia, send me the address.
I'll grab Prentiss.

14:46.402 --> 14:47.402
Sent.

15:03.753 --> 15:06.254
So what's your take
on these guys?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.856
They're contradicting
themselves,

15:07.923 --> 15:10.475
exposing bodies but then going
through all of this to hide it.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.161
Do you think they wanted us
on the case?

15:13.229 --> 15:15.297
Us, the BAU?
Why would they?

15:15.365 --> 15:17.199
Ego. Control.

15:17.266 --> 15:18.700
Some kind of agenda.

15:18.768 --> 15:21.436
I don't think we're even on
their radar, Prentiss. Do you?

15:21.504 --> 15:23.038
You're right.

15:23.106 --> 15:25.340
Why would we be?

15:50.767 --> 15:52.968
Put the shoe back on.

15:55.104 --> 15:56.872
Hold up.
What is it?

15:56.939 --> 15:59.307
Black fella and a woman.
White.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.076
Yeah.
Are they alone?

16:01.144 --> 16:02.277
Is it her?

16:02.345 --> 16:03.845
Yeah.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.498
You sure this is it?

16:06.582 --> 16:09.217
Maybe nobody's home.

16:09.285 --> 16:11.620
Garcia never got an answer.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.728
Prentiss, get down!

16:28.354 --> 16:29.938
Move! Move!

16:36.112 --> 16:37.779
Keep moving.

16:42.485 --> 16:43.618
Look out!

16:49.625 --> 16:51.126
Let's go.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.540
Get in the van.

17:15.852 --> 17:18.019
No! Wait!

17:19.888 --> 17:21.940
Go, go, go, go!

17:47.387 --> 17:49.972
Well, this is one story
that's not gonna get buried.

17:50.039 --> 17:52.841
He's just a kid.
He can't be more than 25.

17:52.909 --> 17:56.645
A kid with an assault weapon
isn't just a kid anymore.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.982
4 rounds total.

18:00.049 --> 18:02.084
That one's yours.
You hit his femoral artery.

18:02.151 --> 18:04.403
He was dead and they knew it.

18:04.487 --> 18:06.488
Bet he didn't bargain
on that when he signed up.

18:06.556 --> 18:10.192
He's got 2 shots to the head and then
one in the wrist. Why the wrist?

18:10.260 --> 18:11.793
To make sure he can't
return fire?

18:11.861 --> 18:14.496
He was dead before
his head hit the sidewalk.

18:17.033 --> 18:18.834
Prentiss.

18:18.901 --> 18:23.205
He's got a tattoo,
at least what's left of one.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.540
They blew a hole
through the tattoo

18:25.608 --> 18:27.809
because we could
have I.D.'D him.

18:27.877 --> 18:31.813
So they're confident we can't I.
D. His face or prints.

18:34.050 --> 18:38.820
No GSWs, no signs
of strangulation.

18:38.888 --> 18:40.455
Dave.

18:40.523 --> 18:42.224
His shoe's untied.

18:50.366 --> 18:52.200
Injected between the toes.

18:52.268 --> 18:54.603
Made to look like
a heart attack.

18:54.671 --> 18:57.439
Armor tech windows,

18:57.490 --> 19:00.542
6-pin locks
on the entrance door.

19:00.609 --> 19:02.511
Same as the Fagans
and the Cosenzas.

19:02.578 --> 19:04.612
20,000 in cash.

19:04.664 --> 19:07.749
Passport. This guy
was on the move.

19:07.817 --> 19:09.618
Outgoing calls.

19:09.686 --> 19:11.670
3218. That's kerry Fagan.

19:11.754 --> 19:12.854
10:30 A.M.

19:12.922 --> 19:17.125
10:31, Delaney calls
the Cosenzas.

19:17.193 --> 19:18.960
Both calls last only seconds.

19:19.028 --> 19:21.897
Didn't leave a message.
Didn't try to warn them.

19:21.964 --> 19:23.365
Somebody warned him.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.151
If not on the phone
then in person.

19:26.235 --> 19:28.470
Whatever these victims
have in common

19:28.521 --> 19:31.139
or whatever
they were a part of...

19:31.207 --> 19:33.158
Didn't happen on U.S. soil.

19:34.527 --> 19:38.013
3 of the 6 victims
are from Europe.

19:38.081 --> 19:40.782
And the mini beryl
says they're serious.

19:40.833 --> 19:44.419
We saw how they move.
They've got be ex-military.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.154
European hit squad
cleaning house?

19:46.222 --> 19:47.422
It's happened before.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.991
They could have
taken us out... easily.

19:50.059 --> 19:51.393
Why didn't they?

19:51.461 --> 19:53.328
FBI agents gunned down in DC

19:53.396 --> 19:54.963
would have definitely
started a war.

19:55.031 --> 19:58.066
A war this kid
wasn't prepared for.

19:58.134 --> 20:00.235
He's just a foot soldier.

20:00.303 --> 20:02.237
Whoever shot him is the leader.

20:02.305 --> 20:06.475
Someone must have warned
Byron Delaney to get out.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.810
And whoever it is
is next on the list.

20:16.953 --> 20:18.537
Thank you.

20:33.702 --> 20:36.271
"The helmsman's wife."

20:36.339 --> 20:39.040
I just finished it.
It's so sad.

20:39.108 --> 20:41.543
I just started it.

20:41.611 --> 20:44.429
Oh! Sorry.
It's a great read to that bit.

20:44.514 --> 20:46.548
The end, the sad bit,
with the wife,

20:46.599 --> 20:48.483
super tragic. You know?

20:48.551 --> 20:50.285
I do now.

20:50.353 --> 20:52.654
You're Jeff, right?

20:52.721 --> 20:53.755
You are...

20:53.823 --> 20:55.157
Penelope Garcia.
Nice to see you.

20:55.224 --> 20:57.576
I'm sorry,
I don't think we've met.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.127
Oh, we haven't.

20:59.195 --> 21:01.163
I've with the FBI.

21:01.230 --> 21:02.931
Good for you.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.735
Why did you pull that story?

21:08.004 --> 21:09.454
You should know.

21:09.539 --> 21:11.957
The FBI didn't tell you
to pull it, did they?

21:12.041 --> 21:14.593
No, no, no, I'm not
saying Jack to you.

21:14.677 --> 21:16.211
You already ruined
one ending for me.

21:16.262 --> 21:18.146
Listen, two families died
in those fires.

21:18.214 --> 21:20.515
You were suspicious
and you were right to be.

21:20.583 --> 21:24.486
You don't look like
an agent to me.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.888
I'm a...Hired nerd

21:26.956 --> 21:30.459
for the behavioral
analysis unit.

21:30.526 --> 21:33.028
You think it's a serial killer?

21:33.095 --> 21:34.863
I think that theory

21:34.931 --> 21:37.299
should be at the beginning
part of your story.

21:37.366 --> 21:40.035
There's no story.

21:40.102 --> 21:42.637
Not... not the one
that I want to tell.

21:42.705 --> 21:45.373
Ok, maybe not now, but when
whoever is telling you to pull it

21:45.441 --> 21:48.343
is no longer a threat, with the right
source it could be front page.

21:48.411 --> 21:50.679
It could be the next Watergate.
It could lead to a book.

21:50.746 --> 21:52.280
Your book.

21:55.384 --> 21:58.119
The threat being
to the shareholders.

21:58.187 --> 22:01.389
Shareholders that are
affected detrimentally?

22:01.457 --> 22:03.225
I think you mean financially.

22:04.393 --> 22:05.760
Follow the money?

22:06.846 --> 22:09.564
Oh, that sounds like
a very good ending.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.132
For you, I mean.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.268
Yes, it does.

22:24.747 --> 22:26.448
Reid, you got anything?

22:26.499 --> 22:29.618
The damage is pretty extensive, but
luckily some of the tattoo remains.

22:29.669 --> 22:32.120
Seaver, get the victim's
photo out to the press.

22:32.171 --> 22:34.206
I think I know
who dug the hole.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.091
The journo told me
to follow the money,

22:36.158 --> 22:38.009
like straight up, that's
what he told me, so I did.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.996
It turns out "the gazette"
is owned by a multinational

22:41.063 --> 22:43.665
global conglomerate... oil,
new technologies, shipping,

22:43.733 --> 22:44.900
air and ground transportation,

22:44.967 --> 22:46.268
all of which employ
the services

22:46.335 --> 22:48.537
of one company... CWS.

22:48.604 --> 22:49.671
Clear water securities?

22:49.722 --> 22:50.672
You know them?

22:50.723 --> 22:52.340
I've come across them.

22:52.408 --> 22:54.876
They're a private counterintelligence
group out of Geneva.

22:54.944 --> 22:57.212
Ron Cosenza, Byron Delaney,
kerry Fagan

22:57.280 --> 22:59.748
all worked for CWS.

22:59.815 --> 23:01.700
7 years ago.
How long ago?

23:01.784 --> 23:02.850
Seaver, hang up.

23:02.902 --> 23:04.986
Do we have a problem?

23:05.054 --> 23:06.421
Well, CWS does.

23:07.657 --> 23:10.258
Got it.

23:26.008 --> 23:27.475
Hey.

23:27.543 --> 23:28.944
What's going on?

23:29.011 --> 23:30.211
Are you ok?

23:30.263 --> 23:33.615
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm good.

23:34.850 --> 23:37.485
I'm not a profiler, but you...

23:37.553 --> 23:39.921
don't start.

23:39.989 --> 23:42.524
I'm sorry.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.580
I'm...I'm gonna be all right.

23:48.664 --> 23:51.132
Ok.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.734
I'm just really worried
about you.

23:52.802 --> 23:55.470
I think the flu
is going around.

23:55.538 --> 23:57.005
Are you pregs?

23:57.073 --> 24:00.241
No. No.

24:00.309 --> 24:04.245
No, I'm just...
I'm not sleeping.

24:05.615 --> 24:08.783
I'm having this nightmare.

24:08.851 --> 24:10.518
It's a recurring nightmare.

24:10.586 --> 24:12.153
I...

24:12.221 --> 24:15.657
There's a hill,
and there's a little girl

24:15.725 --> 24:17.158
on top of the hill.

24:17.226 --> 24:19.227
She's like 6 years old,

24:19.278 --> 24:20.996
dark hair.

24:21.063 --> 24:23.198
And she's just dancing
in the sun.

24:23.265 --> 24:26.768
But somehow I know that
she's waiting for me,

24:26.836 --> 24:29.337
so I start to walk
up the hill...

24:29.405 --> 24:32.173
But the hill gets steeper
and steeper,

24:32.241 --> 24:36.011
and by the time
I climb to the top,

24:36.078 --> 24:37.412
the little girl's gone.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.181
And I look everywhere for her,

24:40.249 --> 24:42.684
and when I can't find her,

24:42.752 --> 24:45.020
I start to panic.

24:45.087 --> 24:47.339
And I panic because I know

24:47.423 --> 24:49.524
what's waiting out there
for her.

24:49.592 --> 24:53.395
I know what the world
can do to a girl

24:53.462 --> 24:56.297
who only sees beauty.

24:56.365 --> 24:57.799
Like you.

25:00.870 --> 25:04.973
Somehow you...
you always make me smile.

25:05.041 --> 25:09.411
And I don't think I've ever
thanked you for that.

25:10.913 --> 25:12.914
Hotch needs you in the Scif.

25:12.982 --> 25:14.916
Ok.

25:24.994 --> 25:26.761
Exactly why did you
bring us here?

25:26.829 --> 25:31.332
And why is the BAU
interested in CWS?

25:31.384 --> 25:34.102
Why did you pull that story?

25:36.171 --> 25:38.356
That's how you remember them.

25:38.441 --> 25:40.075
And that is now they are now.

25:40.142 --> 25:42.944
You warned your friend
Byron Delaney.

25:43.012 --> 25:46.081
You knew him the longest.
It's too bad you were too late.

25:47.416 --> 25:50.652
If you're looking for reactions,
this is our business.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.220
Business?

25:52.288 --> 25:54.122
Ugly as that sounds.

25:54.190 --> 25:56.124
Kerry Fagan, Ron Cosenza,
and Byron Delaney,

25:56.192 --> 25:58.026
they all worked for CWS.

25:58.094 --> 26:01.162
As do 40,000 other subcontractors
all over the world.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.498
So they were
subcontracted to you.

26:03.566 --> 26:05.166
If you're looking for answers,

26:05.234 --> 26:06.901
take it up with
the main contractor.

26:06.969 --> 26:08.169
And that would be?

26:08.237 --> 26:09.938
Your government.

26:10.005 --> 26:11.906
Whoever is killing
these families

26:11.974 --> 26:14.275
holds your company responsible,
not the government.

26:14.343 --> 26:17.479
We run operations from the
middle east to Antarctica.

26:17.546 --> 26:19.814
Going over them all
will take months.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.484
So you've already started
investigations?

26:22.551 --> 26:25.453
That's why you pulled
the story.

26:32.278 --> 26:35.563
The cases these people were
involved in are protected

26:35.631 --> 26:38.166
by a multinational
official secrets agreement.

26:38.234 --> 26:39.667
Even if I wanted to...

26:39.735 --> 26:42.070
these people were killed
on U.S. soil

26:42.138 --> 26:45.707
by trained suspects
who fired on federal agents.

26:47.409 --> 26:49.677
As a courtesy
and out of respect

26:49.745 --> 26:52.180
for the predicament
your company now faces,

26:52.248 --> 26:53.615
everything in this room
is off the record.

26:53.682 --> 26:55.717
However, outside this room,

26:55.785 --> 26:57.652
if you withhold information
about the case,

26:57.720 --> 27:00.388
you and your company
will be held fully accountable.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.262
All right.
What do you know?

27:07.329 --> 27:09.330
We're looking for
a European team,

27:09.398 --> 27:10.832
with considerable training.

27:10.900 --> 27:12.367
And for one of them,
it's personal.

27:12.434 --> 27:14.435
Why do you think that?

27:14.503 --> 27:16.971
Because they could have spared the
child, but they chose not to.

27:17.039 --> 27:20.909
The killing of Samuel Cosenza
by one of the team was personal.

27:20.976 --> 27:23.011
One of the attackers
shot last night

27:23.078 --> 27:25.480
had the remains of a tattoo
on his wrist.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.920
On the surface the tattoo may
look like a simple four-leaf clover.

27:31.971 --> 27:33.855
But the stem has a "v"
at the end.

27:33.923 --> 27:37.425
We believe this is associated with
a hidden sect of fallen warriors.

27:37.493 --> 27:40.728
It's also the name of a ship famous for
its journeys from dublin to America,

27:40.796 --> 27:41.930
the "Valhalla."

27:41.997 --> 27:44.332
Have you seen that before?

27:44.400 --> 27:46.434
We ran an operation
to capture the leader

27:46.502 --> 27:50.672
of a breakaway ira faction
years ago.

27:50.739 --> 27:52.106
He assumed that moniker.

27:52.174 --> 27:53.408
What's his name?

27:56.011 --> 27:57.478
Ian Doyle.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.491
Happy Birthday, my love.

28:59.829 --> 29:01.696
Ok, Ian Doyle's officially
on everyone's list.

29:01.764 --> 29:03.014
His mug is all over the place.

29:03.099 --> 29:05.367
He's not gonna be able
to get out of the district

29:05.434 --> 29:06.868
unless he sprouts
wings himself.

29:06.936 --> 29:08.370
It's not that I'm not happy
that we have his name,

29:08.437 --> 29:10.171
but how are we supposed
to know who's on his list?

29:10.239 --> 29:11.606
We study his life

29:11.674 --> 29:14.442
and every single person he's
ever come in contact with.

29:14.493 --> 29:17.946
Look, Doyle's been
away for 7 years,

29:18.014 --> 29:20.181
but he still managed to figure
out who the players were.

29:20.249 --> 29:22.851
Maybe we should start with
how he got out of prison.

29:22.918 --> 29:24.753
Russia, I think.
Well, where was he locked up?

29:24.820 --> 29:26.554
Actually, there are no
extradition papers on him.

29:26.622 --> 29:29.924
Was Doyle on your radar
when you were at interpol?

29:29.992 --> 29:33.328
Uh, sure, I had heard of
him, but direct contact?

29:33.396 --> 29:35.163
I'd have to ask around.

29:35.231 --> 29:37.165
Do.

29:37.233 --> 29:40.268
Good guys and bad
keep files close to them.

29:40.336 --> 29:42.203
What are in these files?

29:42.271 --> 29:45.774
It's intel. Insurance. Protection.
For times like this.

29:45.841 --> 29:48.910
Maybe I should go to Byron Delaney's
house and see what I can find.

29:48.978 --> 29:51.146
Take Prentiss with you.
She might have some insight.

29:58.237 --> 30:01.022
No one's getting back to you?

30:01.073 --> 30:03.958
I only have a couple of contacts,
but they'll get back to me.

30:10.299 --> 30:12.634
What, are we being
followed, 007?

30:12.701 --> 30:15.270
No, but you should
go through the city.

30:15.337 --> 30:17.055
66 is gonna be miserable
right now.

30:17.139 --> 30:18.473
We'll get there.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.759
Oh, before Doyle
takes somebody else out?

30:20.843 --> 30:23.645
He's shooting up federal agents.
What's he gonna do next?

30:23.712 --> 30:25.213
What would you like me to do?

30:25.264 --> 30:27.849
Get creative with your driving.

30:27.900 --> 30:28.983
I'm working on it, Prentiss.

30:30.719 --> 30:35.790
Hey. Thanks for getting back.
I need some intel on Ian Doyle.

30:35.858 --> 30:37.358
Are you alone?

30:37.426 --> 30:39.861
Not at all.
Anything you can spare.

30:39.929 --> 30:40.945
Is your team in danger?

30:41.030 --> 30:42.447
Absolutely. You should
start with our victims,

30:42.531 --> 30:45.784
Ron Cosenza, kerry Fagan,
Byron Delaney.

30:45.868 --> 30:47.702
See if they connect
to Doyle in any way.

30:47.770 --> 30:49.504
I'll send you a document.

30:49.571 --> 30:51.706
I'll be waiting for it.
Thanks.

30:51.757 --> 30:52.707
They got something?

30:52.758 --> 30:56.044
I don't know. We'll see.

30:58.614 --> 31:01.249
You know, Emily, you really
need to trust people.

31:02.635 --> 31:03.751
I trust people.

31:03.819 --> 31:04.853
No, you don't.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.105
You don't because you can't.

31:07.189 --> 31:09.023
And I get it. Every time you
tried to count on someone,

31:09.091 --> 31:11.092
they let you down,
so you go it alone.

31:11.143 --> 31:13.995
You'll never admit that because
you're just too damn stubborn.

31:14.063 --> 31:16.998
It's all right.
It doesn't really matter.

31:17.066 --> 31:19.033
But I'll tell you
what does matter.

31:19.101 --> 31:21.369
That you can trust me, Emily.

31:21.436 --> 31:23.705
With anything.

31:23.772 --> 31:25.290
I'm serious. No matter
how awful you think it is,

31:25.374 --> 31:27.408
I promise you,
you are not alone.

31:31.614 --> 31:34.282
I just wish you'd believe that.

31:36.018 --> 31:38.553
I do.

31:43.509 --> 31:45.894
You profile me again,
you'll wish you hadn't.

31:56.572 --> 31:58.406
The more players
we get on this board,

31:58.473 --> 32:00.408
the sooner Erin
will get her nose in it.

32:00.476 --> 32:01.676
Strauss already knows.

32:01.744 --> 32:03.811
I'm surprised
she wasn't in the Scif.

32:03.863 --> 32:05.947
She's on vacation.

32:06.015 --> 32:08.616
Oh, great. Now she'll never
take another one.

32:09.818 --> 32:12.020
Is everything about this guy
classified?

32:12.087 --> 32:13.087
Somebody knows him.

32:13.155 --> 32:15.489
We just haven't found them yet.

32:31.173 --> 32:33.141
There's a safe in the bedroom.

32:33.209 --> 32:34.776
Behind a big painting?

32:34.843 --> 32:37.678
Yeah, it's not
gonna be in there.

32:39.198 --> 32:43.785
It's gonna be somewhere
where he can sit

32:43.852 --> 32:46.154
and still gain access to it.

32:50.459 --> 32:52.794
And he's gotta be quick.

33:06.708 --> 33:09.260
Get outta here.

33:12.348 --> 33:14.399
That's Dreyer.

33:14.483 --> 33:17.952
Kerry Fagan, Ron Cosenza.

33:18.020 --> 33:21.756
Delaney's not in it.
Why would he have that picture?

33:21.824 --> 33:24.092
Maybe he was their handler.

33:27.363 --> 33:29.897
Here's the million-dollar question...

33:29.965 --> 33:31.399
anyone know
what language that is?

33:31.467 --> 33:33.001
Those are villages
in north Korea.

33:33.068 --> 33:34.252
I love you.

33:34.336 --> 33:35.420
Of course she does.

33:35.504 --> 33:38.790
There's a political prison
near Haengyong-ni.

33:38.874 --> 33:40.775
Camp 22. Kwan-li-so.

33:40.843 --> 33:43.444
North Korea denies it exists.

33:43.512 --> 33:45.763
You think they took Doyle there?

33:45.848 --> 33:47.315
That would explain
why he's after them.

33:47.383 --> 33:48.983
Even his prison
is off the grid.

33:49.051 --> 33:50.952
All we know is that he was never
married, had multiple residences,

33:51.020 --> 33:53.021
and was arrested
at his tuscan villa.

33:53.088 --> 33:54.889
There's paperwork
to back that up?

33:54.957 --> 33:57.325
And a list of who was there that day.
There may be photographs.

33:57.393 --> 33:59.027
Reid's looking into that now.

33:59.094 --> 34:02.330
Right. So those people need to be
warned that he's on the warpath.

34:02.398 --> 34:05.316
They have been. But there's a
whole different life he's led,

34:05.401 --> 34:06.734
one that isn't in any file.

34:06.802 --> 34:10.138
Prentiss, did you hear from
your European associates?

34:10.205 --> 34:11.873
I'm waiting for them
to send me a document.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.007
We need it now.

34:13.074 --> 34:16.476
He's locked in this
hellhole for 7 years.

34:16.545 --> 34:17.545
How did he get out?

34:17.612 --> 34:19.246
Does it really matter?

34:20.882 --> 34:23.951
Doyle was in Kwan-Li-so?

34:24.018 --> 34:27.322
Ah. Well, that was
on a need-to-know.

34:27.389 --> 34:30.525
You didn't think I needed to know that?
Are you kidding me?

34:30.592 --> 34:32.560
And what good would that do?

34:32.627 --> 34:36.097
You don't get to decide
what's good for me anymore.

34:36.148 --> 34:38.132
What else
aren't you telling me?

34:38.199 --> 34:39.233
That's it.

34:39.301 --> 34:41.101
You said he was in Russia.

34:41.152 --> 34:44.138
No, actually, Sean McAllister
told you that.

34:45.306 --> 34:46.524
Tsia?

34:46.608 --> 34:47.525
Yeah.

34:47.609 --> 34:48.743
Get him off the phone.

34:48.811 --> 34:50.311
What are you gonna do, em?

34:50.379 --> 34:52.847
Huh? What are you gonna do?
You gonna run away?

34:52.915 --> 34:54.181
Yeah, you're good at that.

34:54.248 --> 34:55.350
Tsia.

34:55.417 --> 34:56.951
Bloody hell.

34:58.287 --> 34:59.420
Ok.

34:59.488 --> 35:00.872
You can't trust him.

35:00.956 --> 35:03.091
You have got to get out
of there right now.

35:03.158 --> 35:04.876
You are safer on your own.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.995
Do you remember 9th street?
Corelli's. How the door works?

35:08.063 --> 35:09.430
Yeah.

35:10.499 --> 35:11.599
He's still there.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.835
You will be in and out
in 5 minutes.

35:13.902 --> 35:15.837
Got it.

35:15.904 --> 35:18.873
Do not let Clyde follow you.

35:18.941 --> 35:22.143
And, tsia, be careful.

35:22.211 --> 35:23.444
You, too.

35:27.783 --> 35:29.684
Fine.

35:36.825 --> 35:38.326
Hey, what's that?

35:38.377 --> 35:41.746
Uh, oh, this is the only
lead I have so far.

35:41.830 --> 35:44.198
What about you?
Seaver said you were looking for photos

35:44.266 --> 35:46.584
of, uh, Doyle's tuscan villa?

35:46.702 --> 35:48.035
I couldn't find any stills
from the day he was arrested,

35:48.103 --> 35:50.338
but there may be some surveillance
footage from the sedans.

35:50.406 --> 35:51.873
They generally record
everything.

35:51.940 --> 35:52.974
Yeah?

36:01.283 --> 36:02.716
You get a document
from your contacts?

36:02.768 --> 36:04.819
Bank accounts traceable
to our first two victims.

36:04.887 --> 36:07.255
We might be able to match
the rest of those faces.

36:07.322 --> 36:08.556
Good.

36:10.659 --> 36:13.227
What else have you found?

36:48.931 --> 36:50.998
Ok, look in the peephole.

36:54.770 --> 36:58.005
My mother made it.

36:58.073 --> 36:59.574
Christmas.

37:13.204 --> 37:16.004
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.618
That journalist is
eating out of my hand.

37:18.685 --> 37:21.120
He had no idea I was promising
him a full-fledged manhunt.

37:21.188 --> 37:23.789
It's way more than that.
I've counted reps from 5 agencies.

37:23.857 --> 37:26.742
Oh, I love me and
multi-agency taskforcing,

37:26.827 --> 37:28.794
and on our turf.
It gets my blood up.

37:28.862 --> 37:30.196
When are we going
to get started?

37:30.247 --> 37:33.399
Oh, he's drawing up the
battle plan with the troops.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.034
What's holding us up?

37:35.085 --> 37:37.803
We're waiting for somebody from DC
Metro Police, then we can start.

37:37.871 --> 37:39.872
Who's got updates
on roadblocks?

37:39.940 --> 37:43.075
They will. All parkways and interstates
in dc, Maryland, and Virginia

37:43.143 --> 37:44.477
have station checkpoints.

37:44.545 --> 37:46.212
Doyle has the means to get
in and out of the country.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.780
What makes you think he won't
get out of the district?

37:47.848 --> 37:49.882
It's the best we've got
right now.

37:51.818 --> 37:54.086
Metro got held up.
Double homicide on k and 9th.

37:54.154 --> 37:55.922
They want me to take a look.

37:55.989 --> 37:57.156
Doyle?

37:57.224 --> 37:58.658
Vic's apartment looks like
a black market forger.

37:58.725 --> 38:00.426
The other victim?

38:00.494 --> 38:02.562
A woman, 30s, no I.D.,
outside his door.

38:02.629 --> 38:04.297
I'm coming with you.

38:04.364 --> 38:05.781
Go.

38:13.123 --> 38:16.075
Hey. You sure you want
to leave?

38:16.126 --> 38:19.295
We're only passing through.

38:19.379 --> 38:21.013
But she's the one.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.748
You just gonna leave her?

38:29.389 --> 38:30.890
Think she'll follow us?

38:30.958 --> 38:33.125
Me. She'll follow me.

38:33.193 --> 38:34.894
Why?

38:34.962 --> 38:36.796
Because she must.

38:42.302 --> 38:45.238
This guy took 2 in the chest.

38:45.305 --> 38:48.574
He went quickly.

38:48.625 --> 38:50.876
One straight to the forehead.

38:50.944 --> 38:52.845
The holes were made
by a .45.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.847
So she comes to the door,

38:54.915 --> 38:57.350
and he shoots her.

38:57.417 --> 38:58.985
She didn't stand a chance.

38:59.052 --> 39:02.154
This has to be the work
of our guy.

39:02.222 --> 39:04.090
She might be on our list.
We should run her prints.

39:04.157 --> 39:05.925
I need some air.

39:19.823 --> 39:22.108
What did you do,
pull a whiskey Pete's?

39:22.159 --> 39:24.543
Uh, I don't know
what that means.

39:24.611 --> 39:27.113
But if it involves
getting vomit on your boots,

39:27.180 --> 39:28.781
then, yeah, I'm guilty.

39:28.849 --> 39:30.683
You need a soda?
What can I do?

39:33.186 --> 39:35.421
I live 10 minutes from here.
Can we just swing by?

39:35.489 --> 39:37.423
'Cause I think I got it
on my pants, too.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.125
Hotch wants us to get back.

39:39.192 --> 39:42.561
I know. I'll be really
quick, I promise.

39:42.629 --> 39:44.496
Ok.

39:55.709 --> 39:59.578
It'd be so easy to take
her out here and now.

39:59.646 --> 40:01.514
She hasn't confessed yet.

40:01.581 --> 40:04.450
All roads coming
and going are blocked.

40:04.517 --> 40:07.570
If we don't make it out
of here, she wins again.

40:09.389 --> 40:11.490
Have a little faith.

41:14.888 --> 41:17.440
It's not often that
we know a subject's name,

41:17.524 --> 41:20.309
and in this case, knowing Ian Doyle's
identity doesn't give us very much.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.479
He's known to a select few,
and those who know him well

41:23.563 --> 41:27.500
either work beside him
or they're on his list.

41:27.567 --> 41:30.035
2 or 3 of his victims
worked for cws

41:30.103 --> 41:33.205
and were responsible for his
transport to north Korea.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.341
There were 7 operatives
on the mission altogether,

41:35.409 --> 41:37.209
and the remaining 5
have been warned.

41:37.277 --> 41:38.944
All the federal
and international agents

41:39.012 --> 41:40.813
responsible
for tracking him down

41:40.881 --> 41:42.515
are now on his list of targets.

41:42.582 --> 41:44.950
We'll find Doyle the way
we find any other offender...

41:45.018 --> 41:47.319
by studying his behavior.

41:47.387 --> 41:50.456
We'll dissect his every move
since he regained his freedom.

41:50.507 --> 41:52.591
When he escaped
from north Korea,

41:52.659 --> 41:54.693
he killed a man
and he used his vehicle

41:54.761 --> 41:57.163
to cross the border
into Russia.

42:12.679 --> 42:13.879
You good?

42:13.947 --> 42:16.482
I'm good.

42:52.519 --> 42:55.287
Journalist Dorothy Dix wrote,

42:55.355 --> 42:58.090
"confession is always weakness.

42:58.158 --> 43:00.793
"The grave soul
keeps its own secrets

43:00.860 --> 43:04.630
and takes its own
punishment in silence."

43:08.381 --> 43:11.727
