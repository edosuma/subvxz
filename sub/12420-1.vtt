00:47.610 --> 00:50.777
How come there isn't
booze in this thing?

01:15.638 --> 01:18.273
Nice mullet, dude!

01:18.274 --> 01:20.308
I do look wonderful, don't I?

01:22.278 --> 01:24.646
Here's champagne, you guys.
Champagne. Everybody, cheers.

01:24.647 --> 01:26.481
- Cheers.
- This is fun!

01:28.317 --> 01:30.418
Party has arrived!

01:30.419 --> 01:33.554
- Fuckin' rad!
- What's up, bro?

01:33.555 --> 01:35.523
Guys, come on, a toast.
Seriously, everybody.

01:35.524 --> 01:37.458
- Everybody. You got some?
- Cheers.

01:42.063 --> 01:43.965
Marcus!

01:43.966 --> 01:45.967
Check it out, man. Limo, buddy!

01:47.636 --> 01:50.136
Let's get fucked up!

01:51.472 --> 01:53.941
Tonight is gonna be killer.

01:53.942 --> 01:56.311
Bernadette went all out on this shit.

01:56.312 --> 01:58.879
- Well, she is the queen of details.
- More like obsessive.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.582
I'd shoot myself in the face
if I was anything like her.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.918
Doesn't stop you from
drinking her champagne.

02:05.854 --> 02:08.690
- What is that?
- Shroom ball.

02:08.691 --> 02:10.758
I got 'em from the guy on set.
He gave 'em to me.

02:10.758 --> 02:12.560
- Mushrooms?!
- What kind of movie is it gonna be?

02:12.561 --> 02:16.431
Like psychedelic porn?
Like people getting all tripped out

02:16.432 --> 02:18.433
and, like, fucking goats and shit?

02:18.434 --> 02:21.402
No, it is a real movie
this time... totally legit.

02:21.403 --> 02:23.071
I have lines and everything.

02:23.072 --> 02:25.106
Oh, congrats, sis, that's awesome.

02:25.107 --> 02:27.909
Thanks, bro. I'm totally psyched.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.644
Speaking of lines, Jules,
you got any blow?

02:29.645 --> 02:32.413
Don't insult me. Of course I do.

02:33.014 --> 02:34.048
Who's left?

02:34.049 --> 02:36.384
- Lily.
- Easy, trigger.

02:36.385 --> 02:39.354
Hey, man, I think you
have one more stop.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.392
Thank you.

02:44.393 --> 02:46.027
What the hell?

02:46.028 --> 02:47.962
Lily's not on this list.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.509
Goatee... bold choice.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.643
Nice hair, motherfucker.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.082
- Mmm, yes.
- Creeper.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.151
Suck a good dick, don't you?

03:44.152 --> 03:46.521
Get out of this goddamn thing.

03:46.522 --> 03:49.457
- Thanks, man.
- Yep. You probably do, too.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.726
Hi.

03:51.727 --> 03:53.861
You dirty bitch.

03:55.798 --> 03:59.699
- Bye.
- Mmm, nice tits.

04:00.802 --> 04:03.303
Fuck off.

04:07.975 --> 04:09.577
Is she even home?

04:09.578 --> 04:11.712
This may be our last party here ever.

04:11.713 --> 04:14.916
Bernadette says she wants to move.
She can't stand the people.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.618
Can you imagine having to be
a psychologist in this town?

04:17.619 --> 04:18.986
Psychiatrist.

04:18.987 --> 04:20.521
Psychologist.

04:20.522 --> 04:22.623
I think I know.
I introduced her to everyone.

04:22.624 --> 04:23.958
Whatever. It's the same thing.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.561
- No, it's not, Blane.
- Whatever, Sara.

04:26.562 --> 04:28.129
Oh, no!

04:28.130 --> 04:30.797
I left my phone in the limo.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.868
Oh, crap.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.875
Bernadette?

04:40.876 --> 04:43.711
- Dude, what's it say?
- What's what say?

04:43.712 --> 04:46.547
- The note, idiot.
- Oh.

04:46.548 --> 04:49.182
It says, "come around back."

04:59.894 --> 05:01.529
Bernie?

05:03.799 --> 05:05.032
Door's open.

05:05.033 --> 05:07.867
Yo, Bernie, quit fucking around.

05:10.973 --> 05:14.575
- Have a nice trip?
- See you next fall!

05:14.576 --> 05:16.611
Ow. Fuck.

05:16.612 --> 05:19.547
Why is this shit lying in the middle
of the fucking floor like that?

05:19.548 --> 05:21.249
Bernie?

05:21.250 --> 05:23.217
Ow, fuck.

05:23.218 --> 05:25.218
Bernadette?

05:29.691 --> 05:31.626
It's not fucking funny!

05:31.627 --> 05:34.996
- A little bit.
- You should have seen your faces.

05:34.997 --> 05:37.198
- I almost had a heart attack.
- Oh, you're fine.

05:37.199 --> 05:40.601
Oh, we can't have you
checking out early.

05:40.602 --> 05:43.271
- I think I'm gonna...
- Can I go to the bathroom?

05:43.272 --> 05:45.740
Oh, you know what?
My bathroom's off limits.

05:45.741 --> 05:47.742
Sorry. You can use
the one in the hall.

05:47.743 --> 05:50.077
- I'm gonna go too.
- Did you make fudgy panties?

05:50.078 --> 05:52.179
Fuck off.

05:54.182 --> 05:56.017
Everyone else ready for a cocktail?

05:56.018 --> 05:58.185
- Yes.
- Seriously, though, did you?

06:00.289 --> 06:03.024
Nice little spread here.

06:03.025 --> 06:04.759
Always impressive, Bernie.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.128
Where's the vodka?

06:09.631 --> 06:13.134
<i>Dark days</i>

06:13.135 --> 06:16.069
<i>Ooh, bright nights</i>

06:18.706 --> 06:20.741
<i>You make it easy...</i>

06:20.742 --> 06:24.579
So when do we start the game?

06:24.580 --> 06:27.848
- Soon.
- You ever played this game before?

06:27.849 --> 06:30.618
I got Blane's sister a
"whodunit" game last Christmas.

06:30.619 --> 06:32.853
But, anyway, I didn't end up going,

06:32.854 --> 06:35.990
but, um, so I don't
really know how to play.

06:35.991 --> 06:40.560
<i>And when you're near...</i>

07:10.625 --> 07:12.860
Cocktails?

07:12.861 --> 07:15.096
<i>You make me higher...</i>

07:18.033 --> 07:21.068
That one there is for you.
It's a virgin.

07:21.069 --> 07:22.837
Thank you for pointing that out.

07:25.173 --> 07:27.106
Thank you.

07:28.042 --> 07:30.343
Thank you.

07:33.748 --> 07:36.950
To... integrity.

07:38.052 --> 07:40.688
Hmm, integrity. I like that.

07:40.689 --> 07:43.090
- Is that like honesty?
- Kind of.

07:43.091 --> 07:45.325
Integrity.

07:46.394 --> 07:48.396
I want to make another toast.

07:48.397 --> 07:49.830
To Adam.

07:49.831 --> 07:52.400
60 days clean... that's awesome.

07:52.401 --> 07:54.835
Cheers, Besty.

07:54.836 --> 07:58.205
Wow, man, you're like an N.A.
poster boy, man. Congratulations.

07:58.206 --> 08:01.676
- Yeah, like N.A. Poser boy.
- You shut your mouth.

08:01.677 --> 08:04.111
Come on, Jules. Come on.
You want me. Just a kiss.

08:04.112 --> 08:07.214
- Never have, never will.
- Come on.

08:07.215 --> 08:10.016
Six years and this
doofus doesn't get it.

08:10.718 --> 08:12.687
Blane, she's a lesbian,

08:12.688 --> 08:15.723
which means she doesn't
like hot dogs.

08:15.724 --> 08:17.758
If she had one bite of my hot dog...

08:17.759 --> 08:20.428
- Ah, that's gross.
- More like Vienna sausage.

08:20.429 --> 08:24.098
Totally! Hot dog? And why
would you want me to bite it?

08:24.099 --> 08:26.267
A woman should bite it, like,
with... not with your teeth,

08:26.268 --> 08:28.536
kind of like a... like...

08:28.937 --> 08:31.906
Your face looks like an
asshole when you do that.

08:32.407 --> 08:33.441
Oh, snap!

08:33.442 --> 08:36.643
- Good one.
- Where's Lily?

08:37.477 --> 08:40.280
Lily's not here.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.764
She will probably not
be joining us for dinner.

08:44.765 --> 08:45.953
Why not?

08:45.954 --> 08:49.356
Ooh, it's part of the murder mystery
we have to solve, isn't it?

08:49.357 --> 08:52.460
Okay. "Tonight we're playing
a game of 'whodunit.'

08:52.461 --> 08:56.163
it's prom night in 1984.

08:56.164 --> 09:00.366
You and your friends are gathered
for some pre-prom partying."

09:03.003 --> 09:06.173
Come on! Okay, come on,
you guys have to get into it!

09:06.174 --> 09:08.309
Okay okay, this is awesome.
Okay okay.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.778
"One of your friends is missing."

09:11.779 --> 09:14.148
"It turns out that someone here...

09:14.149 --> 09:17.184
Yes, one of your closest friends...

09:17.185 --> 09:20.855
is, like, totally a killer!"

09:20.856 --> 09:23.357
Ooh, I knew it! I knew it!

09:24.526 --> 09:27.027
You're so smart.

09:27.028 --> 09:29.997
So, okay. "It's your job to
figure out who the killer is

09:29.998 --> 09:33.534
and why he or she has snapped.

09:33.535 --> 09:35.803
In this house,
there's evidence to be found

09:35.804 --> 09:38.506
which will help you
figure out 'whodunit.'

09:38.507 --> 09:41.375
there's evidence in the kitchen,
the master bedroom,

09:41.376 --> 09:43.544
and the guest bedroom. To find it,

09:43.545 --> 09:46.046
think like a killer.

09:46.047 --> 09:49.917
You should now split up and
meet back in the dining room

09:49.918 --> 09:51.819
with whatever you find,
at which point,

09:51.820 --> 09:53.888
more information will be given."

09:53.889 --> 09:56.857
But we gotta smoke some crack first.

09:56.858 --> 09:58.526
- Smoke crack?
- I don't get it.

09:58.527 --> 10:00.060
- Crack?
- The '80s.

10:00.061 --> 10:02.563
- Oh, right.
- Hey, sheesh!

10:02.564 --> 10:06.133
- So, wait, one of us is the killer?
- Yes.

10:06.134 --> 10:08.068
Okay, but how do I...
How do I know if I'm the killer?

10:08.069 --> 10:11.839
Blane, we need to play
the game in order.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.474
I could be the killer.
Is that... yes?

10:13.475 --> 10:14.473
- Yes.
- Yes, Blane.

10:14.474 --> 10:16.877
I just want to make it straight.
I don't want to fuck it up!

10:16.878 --> 10:18.979
- That's the best idea I've ever heard.
- All right.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.015
Please, God, just play the game.

10:21.016 --> 10:22.817
- Just play the game.
- I just want to get it right.

10:22.818 --> 10:24.485
Let's play the game.

10:24.486 --> 10:27.086
Melanie, partner up? Melanie?

10:28.422 --> 10:31.058
Jules, it's really not fair

10:31.059 --> 10:33.294
that the two geniuses
should get paired up,

10:33.295 --> 10:35.296
- but sometimes that happens.
- Mmm.

10:35.297 --> 10:38.733
The master bedroom
doesn't stand a chance.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.801
Yeah, party. Nice ass.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.873
He's gonna try to have
sex with my sister.

10:45.874 --> 10:48.141
They're gonna ruin Bernie's bed.

10:50.845 --> 10:52.847
That's so gross.

10:55.016 --> 10:57.551
Hmm.

10:57.552 --> 11:00.454
- Well...
- If I was gonna be a killer,

11:00.455 --> 11:04.625
I'd definitely be thinking about sex.

11:04.626 --> 11:06.560
Really? Me too!

11:06.561 --> 11:07.628
Mm-hmm.

11:07.629 --> 11:09.230
- That's so weird.
- Yeah.

11:09.231 --> 11:11.932
Too bad you're packing meat.

11:11.933 --> 11:14.567
Psych, motherfucker!

11:16.303 --> 11:19.173
Really, I'd think about
where to stash the body.

11:19.174 --> 11:20.740
Ah.

11:21.508 --> 11:22.977
Oh.

11:22.978 --> 11:24.879
Did you get my texts?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.881
Oh, I got your texts.

11:26.882 --> 11:29.115
Very cute.

11:30.184 --> 11:32.085
I was at the studio.

11:34.255 --> 11:36.123
Figured you'd be here, right?

11:36.124 --> 11:38.359
And look, there you are.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.127
I'm not always gonna be here.

11:49.603 --> 11:52.138
Play the game.

12:02.116 --> 12:04.317
You are beautiful.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.489
Amazing.

12:11.325 --> 12:14.560
Look, I owe you an apology.

12:18.332 --> 12:20.299
Trust me.

12:25.706 --> 12:27.942
Yo, Jules, yo, check this out.

12:27.943 --> 12:29.576
Huh?

12:29.577 --> 12:32.078
It's everybody.

12:33.681 --> 12:36.116
Aw, cute!

12:36.117 --> 12:39.052
God, that must've
taken her a long time.

12:39.553 --> 12:43.023
Now I feel bad for talking
all that shit. Hmm.

12:43.024 --> 12:45.059
Bernie's all right.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.592
Yeah.

12:47.695 --> 12:49.762
Mmm.

12:51.365 --> 12:53.267
Oh.

12:53.268 --> 12:56.202
Gnarly.

13:01.342 --> 13:03.342
Found it!

13:07.281 --> 13:09.616
So...

13:09.617 --> 13:11.618
You sure you're okay?

13:11.619 --> 13:14.722
Yeah, dude. You and
Mel keep asking me.

13:14.723 --> 13:17.024
Because the last 10
times I talked to you,

13:17.025 --> 13:18.525
you were having a nervous breakdown.

13:18.526 --> 13:21.095
I was really drunk.

13:21.096 --> 13:23.197
For three weeks straight?

13:23.198 --> 13:25.367
Kinda.

13:26.568 --> 13:29.169
Thanks for being here. I'm fine.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.604
No sweat.

13:30.605 --> 13:34.608
Now, if I were a killer, I'd...

13:36.311 --> 13:39.346
Go straight for the knives. Got it.

13:39.347 --> 13:41.448
- Oh, yuck!
- Ew.

13:41.449 --> 13:43.017
Found it!

13:43.018 --> 13:46.319
Bernie, you are one sick puppy.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.424
Wow, that's sick.

13:50.425 --> 13:52.825
- Teeth?
- Yup.

13:54.128 --> 13:56.562
What the hell is that?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.601
That's nasty.

14:04.204 --> 14:06.472
Back to the game.

14:10.810 --> 14:14.015
Whoa, you all right, Jules?
Jules, you all right?

14:14.716 --> 14:17.751
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm starting to feel my buzz.

14:19.754 --> 14:21.789
Yo, you got any more of
that chocolate? Give me some.

14:21.790 --> 14:23.791
You know, that shroom
ball you had in the limo?

14:23.792 --> 14:25.826
Just give me... give me...
just give me some real quick.

14:25.827 --> 14:28.162
- Come on.
- Please.

14:28.163 --> 14:30.930
- Please, punk, please. Come on.
- Please!

14:31.799 --> 14:34.601
I'm your partner. Share.

14:34.602 --> 14:36.437
Please.

14:41.775 --> 14:44.277
But only take half.

14:45.212 --> 14:47.280
All right.

14:50.417 --> 14:52.418
Huh?

14:55.123 --> 14:57.356
Wait, how much did you take?
You take more?

14:59.693 --> 15:01.328
Sucker.

15:01.329 --> 15:02.863
- Ow!
- Come on.

15:02.864 --> 15:05.498
Got it, Bernie!

15:08.802 --> 15:10.871
We found two.

15:10.872 --> 15:13.207
Well done.

15:13.208 --> 15:16.676
Tacky earring...
that bitch deserves it. Ahh!

15:18.813 --> 15:22.816
Really must
say, fellas, this one's a doozy!

15:22.817 --> 15:24.818
- Gross!
- Oh!

15:24.819 --> 15:26.854
- Oh!
- Gross.

15:26.855 --> 15:29.522
This fuckin' tastes like shit.

15:32.861 --> 15:36.463
Okay, now everyone
gets a personal clue.

15:36.464 --> 15:38.565
They're right under your chairs.

15:38.566 --> 15:40.767
Ooh, a present!

15:46.206 --> 15:50.009
- What is it? Hmm.
- You show me yours first.

16:00.722 --> 16:04.158
What am I, a fuckin' magician?

16:04.159 --> 16:06.425
Boiled rabbit!

16:09.328 --> 16:10.430
I don't get it.

16:10.431 --> 16:13.200
Okay, it's that movie where
that guy cheats on his wife

16:13.201 --> 16:15.702
and then that... that crazy
bitch, like, stalks him.

16:15.703 --> 16:17.938
- It's a classic.
- You've seen that movie.

16:17.939 --> 16:19.740
We've watched that
movie like 30 times.

16:19.741 --> 16:21.474
I don't know.

16:24.845 --> 16:27.181
It's cute.

16:30.585 --> 16:34.721
<i>There's a place in France
where the naked ladies dance</i>

16:34.722 --> 16:38.192
<i>There's a hole in the wall
where the men can see it all.</i>

16:47.234 --> 16:51.271
- Mmm. Gay pride.
- Oh, I think this one should be for Jules.

16:51.272 --> 16:53.974
- Yeah.
- Ooh, ahh!

16:55.944 --> 16:57.544
Yeah, by all means.

17:03.484 --> 17:06.653
Oh! Um... uh, "see no evil."

17:06.654 --> 17:09.454
No shit, Sherlock.

17:12.459 --> 17:14.261
Uh-huh.

17:14.262 --> 17:15.561
Uh, Chinese finger trap.

17:15.563 --> 17:17.998
You know, like, two guys, one girl.

17:17.999 --> 17:20.633
You know, like...

17:32.412 --> 17:35.249
- Ooh!
- A black box!

17:35.250 --> 17:37.484
"What's in the box?!"

17:56.537 --> 17:58.471
It went straight for my face.

18:10.484 --> 18:12.486
Hmm.

18:12.487 --> 18:15.855
Ooh, a remote.

18:17.524 --> 18:20.328
Are you gonna turn us on?

18:21.329 --> 18:23.597
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:23.598 --> 18:25.499
Get up.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.401
- I'm okay.
- The party... here's the party.

18:27.402 --> 18:29.736
Jeez, are you okay?
Are you okay, sis?

18:29.737 --> 18:32.406
Fine, I'm fine. I'm okay.

18:32.407 --> 18:34.641
I just couldn't move
for a second. I'm okay.

18:34.642 --> 18:36.643
Jeez, Jules, I knew you
were mixing too much stuff.

18:36.644 --> 18:38.378
Lighten up, party.

18:38.379 --> 18:41.014
- Oh, my God.
- You all right, Adam?

18:41.015 --> 18:44.584
- I feel fucked up.
- Ow. I can't...

18:44.585 --> 18:46.653
You guys all right?

18:48.423 --> 18:51.023
- I can't feel my legs.
- Me neither.

18:53.427 --> 18:55.095
What'd you put in the
punch, Bernadette?

18:55.096 --> 18:57.364
This part of the game or what?

18:57.365 --> 18:59.565
Are you all right?

19:00.434 --> 19:02.436
- Bernie, are you okay?
- Call 911.

19:02.437 --> 19:04.938
Guys, don't freak out.
We don't need to call 911.

19:04.939 --> 19:07.407
It's just part of the... the party.

19:07.408 --> 19:09.076
- Jesus!
- Fuck, he's on the floor!

19:09.077 --> 19:12.045
Somebody tell me what the
fuck is going on here!

19:12.046 --> 19:14.881
- Dude, are you all right?
- We're okay, we're okay.

19:14.882 --> 19:17.451
Get me up. Get me the fuck up.

19:17.452 --> 19:19.653
Wait, wait, can...
can't anyone get up?

19:19.654 --> 19:21.355
- No! No!
- What... what...

19:21.356 --> 19:24.858
How'd you get those
pineapples to sit so still?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.827
- She's fucking tripping, all right?
- No shit, man.

19:26.828 --> 19:28.762
- What?
- 'Cause she took mushrooms, all right?

19:28.763 --> 19:30.464
- Dude, stand up.
- I can't!

19:30.465 --> 19:31.764
What?

19:31.765 --> 19:34.568
Well, she took mushrooms in the limo and
then more when we were in the bedroom.

19:34.569 --> 19:37.037
I took some too.

19:37.038 --> 19:40.107
Jules, do you still
see the pineapples?

19:40.108 --> 19:42.109
Yeah, they're right there.

19:42.110 --> 19:45.645
Can you get up and go get
me one of those pineapples?

19:45.646 --> 19:47.647
They'll knock themselves
down eventually.

19:47.648 --> 19:50.817
I just gotta get a
good angle on them.

19:50.818 --> 19:52.886
Okay, so no one... no one can get up?

19:52.887 --> 19:55.154
- Clearly no.
- Sara, can you get up?

19:56.056 --> 19:58.157
I can't get up.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.598
What the fuck?

20:08.168 --> 20:10.504
No one asked me if I could move.

20:10.505 --> 20:12.638
What's going on?

20:15.008 --> 20:16.710
What the hell is going on?

20:16.711 --> 20:18.945
Okay, relax, everyone.
This is part of the game.

20:18.946 --> 20:20.147
It's gonna be fun.

20:20.148 --> 20:23.649
What the hell is going on?

20:24.818 --> 20:26.887
Now you will notice that
you can't move your body

20:26.888 --> 20:28.821
from the waist down.

20:30.724 --> 20:32.459
I'm scared.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.562
We're gonna be fine.
It's fine, just part of the game.

20:35.563 --> 20:38.165
- So we're just fine.
- Yeah, it'll be okay. It'll wear off.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.834
Well, the more you drank,
the longer that'll take.

20:40.835 --> 20:43.904
Bernadette, what the fuck?!
What did you do?

20:43.905 --> 20:45.772
You'll see.

20:45.773 --> 20:47.908
Marcus, you were supposed
to stay in your chair.

20:47.909 --> 20:50.477
Oh, my bad. Go fuck yourself.

20:50.478 --> 20:53.079
- This isn't funny.
- I think it's hilarious.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.115
- Bernadette, that's enough.
- It's not cool.

20:55.116 --> 20:57.451
- Bernadette, what the hell did you do?
- This is a fun game.

20:57.452 --> 20:58.685
No, it's not.

20:58.686 --> 21:00.653
You are fucking psychotic!

21:12.999 --> 21:14.801
Where the fuck you going?

21:14.802 --> 21:17.204
Where are you going, Bernadette?

21:17.205 --> 21:19.506
Get up. Please get up, please get up.

21:19.507 --> 21:21.407
- Get up.
- Can you see her? Melanie...

21:21.908 --> 21:23.677
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, no!

21:23.678 --> 21:26.980
- Why would you do that?
- He needed more.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.814
What the fuck is wrong with you?

21:31.818 --> 21:33.720
No, please.

21:33.721 --> 21:36.223
Fuck you, Bernadette.
You fucking crazy whore!

21:36.224 --> 21:38.492
You fucking bitch!

21:38.493 --> 21:42.928
Bernadette, Bernadette, please.
Bernadette, please don't do this.

21:42.929 --> 21:46.166
I will put it in his heart if
you don't shut the fuck up!

21:46.167 --> 21:47.834
I'm sorry.

21:47.835 --> 21:51.104
- Cool.
- No, it's not cool.

21:51.105 --> 21:54.107
You know, I've got access
to all kinds of drugs

21:54.108 --> 21:57.142
much more fun than your street shit.

21:57.811 --> 22:00.830
- Okay, hold, hold, hold... time out.
- Fuckin' shit.

22:00.831 --> 22:02.782
I can't talk and move
him at the same time.

22:02.783 --> 22:06.553
- Don't move him.
- Be right back.

22:06.554 --> 22:08.788
- Fuckin' kill you, Bernadette.
- Had to get out of your chair!

22:08.789 --> 22:11.224
Not going to plan,
fuckin' Bernadette, huh?

22:11.225 --> 22:12.859
Don't antagonize her, Marcus.

22:12.860 --> 22:15.262
- God.
- No, please. Please shh!

22:15.263 --> 22:17.129
Fuckin' psychotic bitch.

22:18.932 --> 22:20.799
Fuck you!

22:23.537 --> 22:26.273
For the love of God.

22:26.274 --> 22:28.742
Fuck you.

22:28.743 --> 22:31.276
Baby, are you okay?

22:46.826 --> 22:48.328
Pay attention, puppies.

22:48.329 --> 22:50.863
Are you ready to play?

22:58.038 --> 22:59.938
Jules.

23:02.242 --> 23:06.812
Come and play with us
forever and ever and ever.

23:20.627 --> 23:24.664
Jules! Your little mushrooms
weren't part of the plan,

23:24.665 --> 23:27.334
but I guess we'll
just have to make do.

23:27.335 --> 23:30.068
You all agree to behave?

23:46.319 --> 23:49.022
Let's go over a couple of rules.

23:49.023 --> 23:51.658
Watch your words tonight

23:51.659 --> 23:54.294
because while you may normally
do things without thinking,

23:54.295 --> 23:57.964
you're accountable for
everything you say.

23:57.965 --> 24:01.401
Everyone gets to ask me
one question... one...

24:01.402 --> 24:04.337
so choose wisely.

24:04.338 --> 24:08.141
When it comes to decisions,
it's minority rule.

24:08.142 --> 24:13.045
Therefore, when I ask for a
vote, all I need is one.

24:15.015 --> 24:16.515
Jules, you all right?

24:20.388 --> 24:22.822
You have to focus, Jules.

24:22.823 --> 24:25.191
You're ruining
audience participation.

24:25.192 --> 24:28.627
You are an ugly stinky cunt.

24:37.237 --> 24:39.372
Wait.

24:39.373 --> 24:43.710
What? You only like it
when the girl doesn't?

24:43.711 --> 24:46.478
I know you've got some.

24:51.685 --> 24:53.653
Finders keepers.

24:54.354 --> 24:56.323
That's right, gang.

24:56.324 --> 24:59.858
Adam's working the
13th step... relapse.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.328
Adam, how could you?

25:02.329 --> 25:04.964
Quality stuff too. Right, Jules?

25:04.965 --> 25:07.901
It's so easy to fall off the wagon
when your sister pulls you off.

25:07.902 --> 25:09.837
Now take a deep breath.

25:10.438 --> 25:13.473
Oh, no, she can handle it. We don't
call her "party" for nothing.

25:13.474 --> 25:15.275
She can't breathe.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.723
You're all the best
of friends, right?

25:29.724 --> 25:31.523
Right?!

25:31.524 --> 25:34.427
You've known each other for a long
time, been through a lot together?

25:34.428 --> 25:38.765
Over the last year, I've gotten
to know you pretty well.

25:38.766 --> 25:42.335
I'd say we're all
really good friends.

25:42.336 --> 25:45.472
That's what just doesn't
make any sense.

25:45.473 --> 25:47.474
Never does.

25:50.144 --> 25:51.778
Jules, look at me.

25:51.779 --> 25:53.780
- Are you okay?
- What are we gonna do?

25:53.781 --> 25:55.515
Relax. Everything's going to be okay.

25:55.516 --> 25:57.515
Fuck, man.

25:57.516 --> 25:58.952
- Everyone just stay cool.
- Now now!

25:58.953 --> 26:00.954
Share with the group.
There will be no more secrets.

26:00.955 --> 26:03.188
Jules, just keep breathing.

26:04.758 --> 26:07.326
You sick bitch.

26:11.164 --> 26:13.500
What did you just say?

26:13.501 --> 26:17.402
I said, "you sick bitch"!

26:20.774 --> 26:24.110
Now you wanna be a tough girl, huh?

26:24.111 --> 26:25.812
Yeah?

26:25.813 --> 26:27.947
You'll see.

26:27.948 --> 26:31.518
I'm just here to help
all of you come clean.

26:31.519 --> 26:34.888
Who a person is behind closed doors

26:34.889 --> 26:38.056
is who they really are.

26:38.992 --> 26:41.995
Are you all ready to see
yourselves in action?

26:45.799 --> 26:47.834
I guess the bigger question is,

26:47.835 --> 26:52.371
are you ready to see your best
friends behind closed doors?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.447
Hidden cameras?

27:03.950 --> 27:05.351
You've been spying on us?

27:05.352 --> 27:07.120
I wouldn't call it spying.

27:07.121 --> 27:09.189
You're fucking sick.

27:09.190 --> 27:11.191
By the time we're done,

27:11.192 --> 27:15.028
you're going to realize I'm
the most honest person here.

27:16.029 --> 27:17.964
I doubt that.

27:18.665 --> 27:20.934
If you're not willing to
do things out in the open

27:20.935 --> 27:24.770
in the presence of friends, then you
probably shouldn't be doing them, right?

27:26.072 --> 27:28.875
You can't say you're
so fucking honest

27:28.876 --> 27:30.577
if you've been watching
us without us knowing.

27:30.578 --> 27:32.612
My house, my rules. If you had
asked, I would have told you.

27:32.613 --> 27:36.314
I didn't think I had to ask my
friend if she was spying on me.

27:38.551 --> 27:42.055
I'd say from what I discovered

27:42.056 --> 27:45.357
you always have to ask
if you're being watched.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.129
Don't move.

27:57.370 --> 27:59.304
Wait. Lily.

28:01.641 --> 28:04.611
Yes, Lily.

28:04.612 --> 28:07.612
- Where is she?
- What did you do to her?

28:09.048 --> 28:10.950
One question at a time.

28:10.951 --> 28:12.652
Where is she or what
have I done to her?

28:12.653 --> 28:14.454
Where is she?!

28:14.455 --> 28:18.457
My question would have answered
that, but fine... where is she?

28:22.295 --> 28:24.197
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no,

28:24.198 --> 28:26.199
I haven't killed her,
if that's what you're thinking.

28:26.200 --> 28:29.201
No, no, no, and have her
miss my going-away party?

28:30.236 --> 28:34.040
Mmm, where is Lily?

28:34.041 --> 28:37.175
This is where the game
really gets going.

28:38.645 --> 28:43.715
For every question I answer,
you have to give me something.

28:45.518 --> 28:48.887
We'll keep the first
one really simple.

28:51.057 --> 28:54.594
In return for my answer, I
get to give you a haircut.

28:54.595 --> 28:55.995
What?

28:55.996 --> 28:58.196
A haircut?

29:00.700 --> 29:03.937
Remember? Group vote? Minority rule?

29:03.938 --> 29:07.206
As the hostess,
I must refrain from voting.

29:07.207 --> 29:09.008
Where the fuck is Lily?

29:09.009 --> 29:12.612
No, Marcus, that's Sara's question.

29:12.613 --> 29:15.682
- You'll have to ask something else.
- Go fuck yourself.

29:15.683 --> 29:18.850
So...

29:39.072 --> 29:41.641
- Do it.
- Screw you, Blane!

29:41.642 --> 29:44.010
It's just a haircut, Sara.
It's gonna grow back.

29:44.011 --> 29:47.013
It only takes one
vote and there it is.

30:13.539 --> 30:15.708
Fuck you!

30:15.709 --> 30:19.178
You fucking dick!

30:19.179 --> 30:23.049
Lily's upstairs.

30:23.050 --> 30:25.351
I'm sorry.

30:25.352 --> 30:27.786
Let's just check in on old Lil.

30:40.233 --> 30:42.467
Lily.

30:47.607 --> 30:48.775
Oh, God.

31:12.533 --> 31:15.300
We... we... we have to kill her.

31:19.672 --> 31:22.408
Bon appetit.

31:22.409 --> 31:24.477
Oh!

31:24.478 --> 31:26.745
- Oh, gross.
- Oh, God.

31:28.548 --> 31:30.316
What is this?

31:30.317 --> 31:32.852
Oh! We have our next question.

31:32.853 --> 31:35.088
Meet your meat, Blane.

31:35.089 --> 31:38.323
What will you give me in return?

31:42.095 --> 31:43.863
That was, uh...

31:43.864 --> 31:46.065
Just rhetorical.

31:46.866 --> 31:50.169
Wow. That's a big
word for you, Blane.

31:50.170 --> 31:52.138
Too bad you don't actually
know what it means.

31:52.139 --> 31:55.808
See, a rhetorical question
doesn't require an answer

31:55.809 --> 31:58.211
because the answer is obvious.

31:58.212 --> 32:03.216
Here, I'll give you an example
of a rhetorical question...

32:03.217 --> 32:06.017
Are you stupid?

32:09.322 --> 32:11.858
I meant hypothetical.

32:11.859 --> 32:14.894
This is why I went over
the rules at the beginning.

32:14.895 --> 32:17.363
You get one question.

32:17.364 --> 32:19.132
That's not the question that
I was asking, Bernadette.

32:19.133 --> 32:21.200
Oh, but you already asked it.

32:21.201 --> 32:24.137
But it's not the question
that I meant to ask.

32:24.138 --> 32:26.506
I've always thought your
eyebrows could use some taming.

32:26.507 --> 32:30.710
- Do it.
- What?

32:30.711 --> 32:32.678
Serves you right for
voting against Sara.

32:32.679 --> 32:35.580
Finally! Someone gets it.

32:36.849 --> 32:38.584
We have one vote.

32:38.585 --> 32:41.521
Oh, Bernadette, when...

32:41.522 --> 32:45.525
when you said earlier
about... about the haircut,

32:45.526 --> 32:47.460
you said "haircut."

32:47.461 --> 32:50.229
You didn't say "scalping."

32:50.230 --> 32:52.265
You said "haircut"!

32:52.266 --> 32:54.367
I didn't understand that
that was the question

32:54.368 --> 32:56.536
- that I was...
- Jules, take it back now!

32:56.537 --> 32:58.838
No, no, Melanie,
there's no taking it back.

32:58.839 --> 33:00.673
I warned you to watch your words.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.475
Sit still, Blane.

33:02.476 --> 33:04.810
I don't want to take
an eye out by accident.

33:06.011 --> 33:08.146
No, no, no!

33:17.957 --> 33:21.227
So the answer to your question is

33:21.228 --> 33:24.730
that meat's just some sick bastard
who touched this little girl

33:24.731 --> 33:27.366
one too many times.

33:47.954 --> 33:49.822
I'm sorry, Sara.

33:49.823 --> 33:51.390
Adam.

33:51.391 --> 33:53.326
You spoiled your dinner.

33:55.762 --> 33:58.596
That was just going
to annoy me all night.

34:05.872 --> 34:07.640
On with the game.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.543
Crap.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.452
Is that the limo driver?

34:19.453 --> 34:21.587
Oh! Hey.

34:21.588 --> 34:23.255
- Hi.
- You look beautiful.

34:23.257 --> 34:24.489
You've having a party, huh?

34:24.491 --> 34:26.492
Party's dying down, actually.

34:28.493 --> 34:30.661
Help!

34:34.632 --> 34:37.003
Sounds like it's going pretty good.

34:37.004 --> 34:39.705
What can I do for you?

34:39.706 --> 34:41.940
Help!

34:41.942 --> 34:43.943
I used to be quite a dancer.

34:43.944 --> 34:45.945
What can I do for you?

34:45.946 --> 34:47.880
Somebody left their phone in my limo.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.983
- I brought it back for you.
- Oh, great, thank you so much

34:50.984 --> 34:53.018
for bringing this back.
Have a great night.

34:53.020 --> 34:55.621
Uh, excuse me, could...
before I leave,

34:55.621 --> 34:57.790
could I use your bathroom?

35:03.295 --> 35:06.299
Help! Help!

35:28.454 --> 35:30.822
What are you doing?

35:53.012 --> 35:56.816
We're fucked. We're fucked.
We're fucked.

35:56.817 --> 35:58.517
She's gonna fucking kill us.

35:58.518 --> 36:00.386
Fuck.

36:07.093 --> 36:10.562
Do you see what you just made me do?

36:13.399 --> 36:14.933
Idiots.

36:29.415 --> 36:32.684
Marcus, you ready?

36:33.986 --> 36:35.687
Jules!

36:36.822 --> 36:38.089
Jules!

36:40.126 --> 36:44.262
You're about to make your debut.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.867
You too, Sara.

36:51.504 --> 36:52.837
Pay attention.

36:59.139 --> 37:02.271
Well, so you all remember
labor day weekend.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.553
<i>...and bones collide, oh!</i>

37:07.554 --> 37:11.524
<i>Love, waking up the dead</i>

37:11.525 --> 37:13.759
<i>And moving the listless</i>

37:13.760 --> 37:15.761
<i>My arms, limbs come alive</i>

37:15.762 --> 37:18.464
<i>Like they were vestiges</i>

37:18.465 --> 37:21.634
<i>Of a dying language that we accepted</i>

37:21.635 --> 37:25.937
<i>Forfeit before you both were born</i>

37:27.740 --> 37:30.509
<i>Now what has turned up missing</i>

37:30.510 --> 37:32.945
<i>And what the dead took with it</i>

37:32.946 --> 37:38.016
<i>No one here really
knows how bad for sure</i>

37:39.118 --> 37:42.186
<i>We simply didn't see the need</i>

37:43.823 --> 37:46.992
<i>And there was no
connection, all agreed?</i>

37:46.993 --> 37:49.161
Let's go to the split screen.

37:49.162 --> 37:52.163
Don't want to miss anything.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.536
Hmm. Marcus.

37:57.537 --> 37:59.538
<i>Welcome to the dance</i>

37:59.539 --> 38:01.907
<i>It's a fragile sway</i>

38:01.908 --> 38:06.411
<i>Back and forth together,
now separate...</i>

38:07.880 --> 38:11.684
They didn't know you
were there. Did they?

38:11.685 --> 38:16.956
<i>No one here among us
can know for sure</i>

38:16.957 --> 38:20.725
<i>We simply didn't see the need</i>

38:21.961 --> 38:25.830
<i>And there was no
connection, all agreed?</i>

38:26.932 --> 38:30.868
<i>But don't worry your mind so</i>

38:31.804 --> 38:33.572
<i>This has got nothing to do with...</i>

38:33.573 --> 38:38.277
<i>There's a place in France</i>

38:38.278 --> 38:42.748
<i>Where the naked ladies dance...</i>

38:45.852 --> 38:50.221
<i>But don't worry your mind so...</i>

38:51.957 --> 38:53.626
Stop it, Bernie.

38:53.627 --> 38:55.594
New rule.

38:55.595 --> 39:00.266
Anyone here says "stop" and you
automatically lose a finger.

39:00.267 --> 39:02.101
No vote required.

39:02.102 --> 39:04.703
No! No!

39:06.006 --> 39:08.641
- Oh, God!
- Fuck!

39:08.642 --> 39:12.143
You might want to put
some pressure on that.

39:21.287 --> 39:23.956
Let's see how it ends.

39:26.626 --> 39:29.295
Yeah, right there. Ah.

39:41.041 --> 39:43.576
You're gonna make me come.

39:43.577 --> 39:44.810
Stop it, Bernie.

39:44.811 --> 39:46.312
I fucking warned you.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.449
- No, no, not again!
- No!

39:52.550 --> 39:54.419
Bernadette!

39:59.592 --> 40:01.860
Fuck you, Bernie. Fuck you.

40:01.861 --> 40:03.162
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

40:03.163 --> 40:04.929
Pressure.

40:09.935 --> 40:13.237
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

40:16.742 --> 40:18.543
Any requests?

40:20.813 --> 40:23.148
We've already taken off two fingers.

40:24.149 --> 40:26.385
Perhaps an ear?

40:26.386 --> 40:28.986
Maybe his eyes?

40:30.689 --> 40:32.957
Yeah?

40:35.995 --> 40:37.862
Jules.

40:38.964 --> 40:41.132
Huh?

40:42.401 --> 40:46.504
Do you want me to punish Marcus?

40:48.173 --> 40:51.710
He watched. So what?

40:51.711 --> 40:54.545
He got off, just like you.

40:55.814 --> 40:59.084
I did not get off to
anything I've seen.

40:59.085 --> 41:01.387
Let's be clear about that.

41:01.388 --> 41:03.554
Hmm.

41:05.391 --> 41:09.128
Psychologically, he has
to give something up

41:09.129 --> 41:12.550
in order to feel like he's paid for
his crime. You'll be helping him.

41:12.551 --> 41:14.166
We are not going to have
you cutting people up

41:14.167 --> 41:16.769
for something that they did
in the heat of the moment.

41:16.770 --> 41:18.370
Yeah, so what?

41:18.371 --> 41:21.239
We're just getting started, Sara.

41:25.078 --> 41:26.812
My bad.

41:26.813 --> 41:28.847
We never addressed
Melanie's question.

41:28.848 --> 41:32.483
What was it?
What have I done to Lily?

41:36.356 --> 41:39.257
Hmm.

41:48.834 --> 41:50.234
Fuck.

41:52.237 --> 41:55.441
- So answer it.
- Shut up, Sara!

41:55.442 --> 42:00.112
Sara's right. I have to answer you,
and you have to give me something.

42:00.113 --> 42:01.747
What are you gonna... never mind.

42:01.748 --> 42:03.749
Shut the hell up, Adam!

42:03.750 --> 42:05.250
I haven't decided yet.

42:05.251 --> 42:07.985
I don't care about the answer, okay?

42:09.888 --> 42:12.091
- I don't care.
- You don't care about what's happened

42:12.092 --> 42:13.826
to one of your best friends?

42:13.827 --> 42:16.862
No! I don't give a fuck
what you did to her,

42:16.863 --> 42:21.200
just please please please please please
don't do anything to me, please!

42:21.201 --> 42:24.101
Shocker.

42:24.937 --> 42:26.570
No.

42:27.806 --> 42:29.540
- Don't.
- Too bad.

42:30.809 --> 42:32.410
You knew the rules.

42:33.812 --> 42:35.214
Fuck me!

42:35.215 --> 42:38.817
Fuck! Oh, no, no, no, no! Oh, fuck!

42:38.818 --> 42:41.186
We do need one vote first.

42:41.187 --> 42:44.823
- Nobody say anything.
- Nice try.

42:44.824 --> 42:46.759
We won't have a stalemate.

42:46.760 --> 42:49.795
I'll just keep chopping off Marcus's
fingers until one of you pipes up.

43:04.109 --> 43:07.078
Can I take Melanie's place?

43:08.814 --> 43:12.818
- You want to take her place?
- Yes.

43:12.819 --> 43:17.021
Do whatever you were gonna
do to her to me instead.

43:19.191 --> 43:22.093
That's friendship.

43:23.996 --> 43:28.167
I'm not gonna sit here and
watch you cut up Marcus.

43:28.168 --> 43:30.803
And I'm not gonna vote for you
to do anything to Melanie.

43:30.804 --> 43:33.205
So if it has to be done,

43:33.206 --> 43:36.073
fine, I'll take it.

43:45.918 --> 43:49.086
I've always liked you best, Sara.

43:49.588 --> 43:52.089
You've got some character.

43:53.125 --> 43:55.526
Just for that...

43:57.362 --> 43:59.198
I'll let you pick which hand.

44:08.407 --> 44:10.275
Don't play, Sara.

44:10.276 --> 44:12.309
You're not even gonna protest this?

44:14.112 --> 44:17.416
Look at me, Sara. Don't look at her.

44:17.417 --> 44:19.418
There you go. You're gonna be fine.

44:19.419 --> 44:21.452
Everything's going to be okay.

44:28.260 --> 44:30.963
This isn't even the worst thing
that's happened to you today.

44:30.964 --> 44:33.332
You know, you've got
my puke all over you.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.233
Jules, tell her!

44:37.936 --> 44:41.172
Tell her she's gonna be okay.

44:46.612 --> 44:51.383
- Keep looking at me.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

44:56.488 --> 44:59.157
Lily came to me because
she needed an abortion.

44:59.158 --> 45:01.826
But you're a psychologist.

45:03.262 --> 45:06.230
I didn't give her
the abortion, you imbecile.

45:08.133 --> 45:10.135
I took her to get it done.

45:10.136 --> 45:13.138
- Of course she had to choose today.
- But she's bleeding.

45:13.139 --> 45:15.607
Well, if you would let me finish...

45:15.608 --> 45:18.443
It's actually what
I didn't do to Lily.

45:18.444 --> 45:21.113
She was bleeding out and
needed medical attention.

45:21.114 --> 45:24.682
I just did what people
do all the time.

45:25.984 --> 45:27.118
Nothing.

45:30.956 --> 45:33.224
Moving on.

45:37.496 --> 45:39.763
Well, Blane?

45:45.437 --> 45:48.305
Blane.

45:50.108 --> 45:52.544
What?

45:52.545 --> 45:55.179
Yeah, Blane... what?

45:55.948 --> 45:58.749
Fuck you, you crazy bitch.
That's what.

46:01.053 --> 46:02.321
Okay.

46:02.322 --> 46:07.525
If you insist, I'll go straight
into it without any intro.

46:20.072 --> 46:22.107
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah.

46:22.108 --> 46:25.711
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. I just wanted to see.

46:25.712 --> 46:27.181
Yeah?

46:29.482 --> 46:31.683
You look good.

46:31.684 --> 46:33.385
Really good.

46:33.386 --> 46:36.121
What are... what are you doing?

46:36.122 --> 46:38.722
I don't know. What am I doing?

46:42.594 --> 46:44.129
What?

46:46.566 --> 46:50.068
Last Christmas, Blane and
I were still together.

46:50.069 --> 46:52.237
He ended up cheating on you
with some 20-year-old.

46:52.238 --> 46:54.072
So that makes it okay?

46:54.073 --> 46:55.906
Fuck you, Melanie!

47:00.345 --> 47:01.546
Mmm.

47:04.684 --> 47:06.685
Don't mind me.

47:06.686 --> 47:08.420
You knew?

47:10.490 --> 47:12.224
Ooh, ooh.

47:15.228 --> 47:17.295
Come here.

47:20.166 --> 47:22.700
Shh.

47:24.269 --> 47:27.205
This button has wanted to
come off for a while now.

47:32.811 --> 47:36.581
Oh. Yeah.

47:39.118 --> 47:41.418
Ah, you like that?

47:59.104 --> 48:00.804
Yeah.

48:09.648 --> 48:11.649
Oh, yeah.

48:18.623 --> 48:20.525
What?!

48:20.526 --> 48:22.627
We all know how you like to watch.

48:26.132 --> 48:28.567
Oh, God. Oh.

48:28.568 --> 48:32.104
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

48:35.208 --> 48:37.776
Oh, God, yeah.

48:37.777 --> 48:41.346
I was hoping we'd see Blane
do some guy-on-guy.

48:41.347 --> 48:43.548
- Fuck me.
- Would have been more dramatic.

48:43.549 --> 48:45.784
But, alas, no.

48:45.785 --> 48:47.484
Oh, God.

48:50.222 --> 48:51.556
Say it.

48:51.557 --> 48:54.359
Say, "fuck me." Say it.

48:54.860 --> 48:56.861
Say it.

49:00.166 --> 49:01.733
Turn it off!

49:01.734 --> 49:06.238
- Yeah, fuck me.
- Turn it the fuck off!

49:07.739 --> 49:09.241
Oh, wait.

49:09.242 --> 49:11.276
I'm gonna come. You want me to come?

49:11.277 --> 49:13.645
- Yes, come on my tits.
- Do you want me to come?

49:13.646 --> 49:16.515
- Yeah.
- Say it. Say it.

49:17.916 --> 49:20.151
Yes. Fuck.

49:20.352 --> 49:22.421
Sharing is caring.

49:22.922 --> 49:25.021
Jules.

49:25.924 --> 49:28.058
What do you think about all this?

49:29.361 --> 49:31.563
Nothin'.

49:31.564 --> 49:33.365
Nothing?

49:35.166 --> 49:36.868
Nothing.

49:36.869 --> 49:41.273
All you're doing is showing a
bunch of friends fooling around.

49:41.274 --> 49:43.275
So what?

49:43.276 --> 49:48.545
We all cheat a little, tell a
little lie here and there.

49:50.549 --> 49:54.418
It doesn't make anything
you're doing justified.

49:55.921 --> 49:59.291
There's no such thing
as a little lie, Jules.

49:59.292 --> 50:02.526
Just like there's no such thing
as being a little pregnant.

50:04.196 --> 50:06.930
Sara, what do you think?

50:08.233 --> 50:10.435
It's disappointing, isn't it?

50:10.436 --> 50:14.439
Oh, Melanie, was it just the
once or did it happen again?

50:14.440 --> 50:17.474
Things like this
usually happen again.

50:19.311 --> 50:20.978
Answer her.

50:26.985 --> 50:28.954
I'm pretty sure you've
got your answer.

50:35.895 --> 50:38.563
You want to write things off
like you just got carried away

50:38.564 --> 50:40.932
in the heat of the moment?
Guess what?

50:40.933 --> 50:46.170
Each of those moments strung
together is a lifetime.

50:48.273 --> 50:50.574
Is there anything you
want me to do, Sara?

50:54.312 --> 50:56.713
Don't.

50:58.350 --> 51:00.385
She's trying to get you
to do something terrible.

51:00.386 --> 51:03.921
Don't let her manipulate you
into doing anything more.

51:05.457 --> 51:08.992
I can't believe this is happening.

51:11.429 --> 51:13.497
I loved you.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.335
I would have done anything for you.

51:17.336 --> 51:21.539
What the fuck did I do
to deserve any of this?

51:21.540 --> 51:23.375
Come off it, Sara.

51:23.376 --> 51:27.312
Don't act like you've never
done anything wrong.

51:27.313 --> 51:28.713
Do tell.

51:28.714 --> 51:33.318
You've been stalking him,
logging into his emails.

51:33.319 --> 51:35.820
What the fuck are you talking about?

51:35.821 --> 51:38.823
Don't act like you're
all holier than thou.

51:38.824 --> 51:42.661
How long you been going
through my shit, Sara?

51:42.662 --> 51:45.063
What the fuck is she talking about?

51:45.064 --> 51:48.967
Maybe as long as you've been
fucking my best friend.

51:48.968 --> 51:50.802
Enough, all right?

51:50.803 --> 51:52.837
Everybody keep their
fucking mouths shut.

51:52.838 --> 51:55.407
Hey, Marcus, you're so perfect,
why don't you tell everybody

51:55.408 --> 51:57.309
what you got arrested for, huh?

51:57.310 --> 52:00.078
Did you not fucking understand me?
Keep you fucking mouth shut!

52:00.079 --> 52:03.581
Wait, wait, wait!

52:03.582 --> 52:08.520
It wasn't for beating up that guy
who was harassing Blane's sister?

52:08.521 --> 52:11.323
No, it was getting for fucking
a parking ticket, all right?

52:11.324 --> 52:13.391
I got a boot on my car
and I went to fucking jail.

52:13.392 --> 52:15.393
Now end the fucking game!

52:15.394 --> 52:18.830
That is so lame.

52:18.831 --> 52:21.265
What is the endgame, Bernadette?

52:22.033 --> 52:23.634
We're getting there.

52:28.540 --> 52:33.044
- Adam.
- Bernie. Please don't.

52:33.545 --> 52:36.915
First of all, I've told
you guys 100 times...

52:36.916 --> 52:40.452
I don't like being called Bernie.

52:40.453 --> 52:43.854
My name is Bernadette.

52:45.023 --> 52:49.961
Secondly, you should be
thanking me, you coward.

52:49.962 --> 52:52.729
I'm giving you a
chance to come clean.

52:55.033 --> 52:57.768
Don't worry, Adam.

52:58.603 --> 53:01.305
You're among friends.

53:20.158 --> 53:22.394
This is a movie.

53:22.395 --> 53:24.628
Bernadette.

53:25.163 --> 53:27.165
Please don't.

53:33.171 --> 53:36.175
Oh, fuck.

53:37.176 --> 53:39.778
- I almost threw up.
- Almost or did?

53:39.779 --> 53:42.147
But I didn't throw up.
I'm feeling really...

53:42.148 --> 53:44.516
Very happy.

53:44.517 --> 53:46.684
- Good good.
- Mmm!

53:49.822 --> 53:51.823
Let's go have a pizza.

53:51.824 --> 53:54.826
- Pizza?
- Yeah, let's have some pizza.

53:54.827 --> 53:55.825
Pizza's so good.

53:55.826 --> 53:58.696
Okay, in a minute.
I just need a little bit of...

53:59.797 --> 54:02.434
- ...Lily time.
- Why?

54:02.435 --> 54:05.437
- Why? Why? Why?
- Friendship.

54:05.438 --> 54:06.805
- Why?
- Friendship.

54:06.806 --> 54:08.540
- Friendship?
- Yeah.

54:08.541 --> 54:10.809
You're a very good friend.

54:10.810 --> 54:13.178
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Okay.

54:13.179 --> 54:15.547
- I say we go outside...
- No.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.888
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

54:23.889 --> 54:25.590
Is this your first time in heels?

54:25.591 --> 54:27.625
What? No, I wear heels all the time.

54:27.626 --> 54:29.194
I wear heels all the time.

54:32.198 --> 54:34.165
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

54:34.166 --> 54:35.533
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

54:35.534 --> 54:37.569
I'm fine. Stop trying to kiss me.

54:37.570 --> 54:39.637
- I'm not trying...
- You are trying to kiss...

54:39.638 --> 54:41.739
No, I'm not,
I'm trying to find this spot.

54:41.740 --> 54:45.176
- Ah!
- There, I found it.

54:45.177 --> 54:46.911
The Lily spot.

54:46.912 --> 54:48.947
I found the Lily spot.

54:53.252 --> 54:56.888
Okay, that's enough. It's not funny.

54:56.889 --> 54:58.890
I know. It's a little bit.

54:58.891 --> 55:01.059
- It's not funny now.
- It's cool.

55:01.060 --> 55:03.194
Please get off me.

55:03.195 --> 55:06.664
- Come on, let's go outside.
- Okay, two seconds.

55:06.665 --> 55:09.501
Adam, what are you doing?

55:09.502 --> 55:11.203
Adam, st...

55:11.504 --> 55:13.838
Adam, stop!

55:13.839 --> 55:16.074
Adam, stop it!

55:16.075 --> 55:18.676
- Shut the fuck up!
- God. You don't have to.

55:18.677 --> 55:20.545
You nearly killed my fucking ear!

55:20.546 --> 55:24.082
Calm... Lily, calm down.

55:25.251 --> 55:28.553
Don't act like you do not

55:28.554 --> 55:31.256
want me to fuck you. Calm down.

55:31.257 --> 55:32.891
Don't.

55:32.892 --> 55:35.125
- You're boring the...
- Fuck out of me!

55:36.594 --> 55:37.962
Doesn't fait shit!

55:40.266 --> 55:42.600
I'm on set. I'm on set.

55:42.601 --> 55:45.736
This is a movie.
I'm on set. I'm on set.

55:48.806 --> 55:50.808
How did my career end up like this?

55:50.809 --> 55:52.277
Oh, Michael Biehn.

55:52.278 --> 55:54.112
Fantasy sequence, Jules?

55:55.915 --> 55:59.050
- Michael, wake up, please!
- I don't fucking speak French!

56:01.120 --> 56:02.854
Fuck you, Jules.

56:02.855 --> 56:05.189
Okay, all right. Enough enough.

56:05.190 --> 56:08.660
- I'm sure it's... I'm sure it's good.
- Where'd all my lines go?

56:08.661 --> 56:10.595
Is this even a union
fucking production?

56:10.596 --> 56:14.032
And you go really really fast and
the ship goes away from earth.

56:14.033 --> 56:17.602
You go at the speed of light, you
actually don't age as quickly.

56:17.603 --> 56:19.804
- You stay young.
- That's right.

56:19.805 --> 56:22.607
Would somebody get me
fucking something to drink?!

56:22.608 --> 56:24.275
What is wrong with this girl?

56:26.645 --> 56:28.713
Stop it!

56:29.714 --> 56:31.916
- Fuck.
- Come back here, please!

56:31.917 --> 56:34.852
Open it for me.
I can't drink it like that.

56:35.353 --> 56:37.655
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

56:37.656 --> 56:40.792
Please don't. I'm sorry.

56:41.293 --> 56:43.995
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't fucking do that.

56:43.996 --> 56:47.298
Talent's flying in.
Talent's flying in. Let's do this.

56:47.699 --> 56:48.766
Fucking bitch!

56:48.767 --> 56:51.703
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Think she's a union actress?

56:51.704 --> 56:53.371
Oh! What the hell?!

56:53.372 --> 56:55.607
It's called the screen actors guild.

56:55.608 --> 56:58.209
- Let's go.
- I can't move!

57:00.646 --> 57:02.013
You want to get out of my chair?

57:02.014 --> 57:03.715
I can't move.

57:03.716 --> 57:05.717
Can we get second team
out of chair, please?

57:05.718 --> 57:07.719
- Somebody? A little help.
- Who the fuck is this girl?

57:07.720 --> 57:09.087
She doesn't even look like me.

57:09.088 --> 57:11.155
- You gotta go.
- I can't get out of my chair.

57:11.156 --> 57:13.992
- I can't get out of my chair!
- Get out of her fucking chair.

57:13.993 --> 57:15.760
- Do it!
- Now!

57:15.761 --> 57:18.363
- Fuck!
- Don't do this.

57:18.364 --> 57:21.099
- Don't do this.
- Do you ever want to work again?

57:21.100 --> 57:22.634
- Yes!
- Oh, my God, Bernadette!

57:22.635 --> 57:25.370
- Do you want to work again, bitch?
- Yes!

57:25.371 --> 57:27.105
- No!
- Yes!

57:27.106 --> 57:29.340
Bernadette, what are you doing?!

57:29.341 --> 57:31.744
Yes!

57:32.745 --> 57:35.980
Oh, my God! You fucking bitch!

57:35.981 --> 57:38.114
Oh, my God!

57:40.051 --> 57:41.754
Oh, my God!

57:42.755 --> 57:46.691
- I don't know what...
- Get out of my chair.

57:46.692 --> 57:49.694
- This is bullshit.
- Get out of her fucking chair!

57:49.695 --> 57:51.863
Get out! Get up!

57:55.234 --> 57:57.702
Get out now or I'll fucking
take you out of here.

57:57.703 --> 57:59.536
Is there craft services around here?

58:00.672 --> 58:02.541
Get the fucking M&Ms.

58:05.810 --> 58:07.345
Get me some M&Ms!

58:07.346 --> 58:10.248
- Bitch.
- You're out of here!

58:10.249 --> 58:13.217
- Jesus Christ.
- Get out now.

58:13.218 --> 58:16.721
- The girl from "Halloween"?
- Rachel?

58:17.722 --> 58:20.791
Get out! Get her out of here!

58:20.924 --> 58:21.755
Bitch.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.095
Get out now or I'll fucking
take you out of here. Bye!

58:24.096 --> 58:25.897
What fucking happened to me?!

58:29.134 --> 58:30.903
Get out of the chair!

58:34.304 --> 58:36.542
- Bitch!
- Out!

58:37.743 --> 58:39.844
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- First positions!

58:39.845 --> 58:43.280
Everybody, first positions!

58:44.816 --> 58:46.284
All of a sudden, everything went...

58:46.285 --> 58:48.486
...black.

58:50.756 --> 58:53.091
Fuck.

58:55.728 --> 58:57.195
What happened?

58:57.196 --> 58:59.529
Adam raped Lily...

59:00.398 --> 59:02.433
and Bernadette cut off his balls.

59:02.434 --> 59:04.969
What? No!

59:04.970 --> 59:07.370
Wait, someone voted yes on that?

59:09.474 --> 59:10.775
You did!

59:10.776 --> 59:13.811
No! No!

59:16.915 --> 59:22.057
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm not laughing.
It isn't... it's not funny.

59:22.058 --> 59:24.989
He's laughing 'cause
he's tripping, bro.

59:25.190 --> 59:26.524
It's not funny.

59:26.525 --> 59:29.160
Jules, are you happy?

59:29.161 --> 59:32.330
You and your mushrooms
are ruining everything.

59:44.509 --> 59:46.177
Game on.

59:49.814 --> 59:54.452
Oh, okay, so we have your brother
and Lily in the bathroom.

59:54.453 --> 59:58.022
And then, oh... oh, who's this?

59:58.023 --> 01:00:00.458
Who's this?

01:00:02.861 --> 01:00:07.799
Adam, what are you doing? Adam?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.067
I didn't... I didn't know what to do.

01:00:10.068 --> 01:00:12.970
- I didn't know what to do.
- Well, well, do something.

01:00:17.543 --> 01:00:19.911
Stop him!

01:00:20.812 --> 01:00:23.981
Adam! Adam, stop!

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:28.018
- Oh, or do nothing at all.
- Adam, stop it!

01:00:31.189 --> 01:00:33.858
Has Adam ever tried
that on you, Jules?

01:00:33.859 --> 01:00:35.593
Never.

01:00:35.594 --> 01:00:37.328
Hmm.

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:40.231
I would have had a shred
of empathy if he had.

01:00:41.324 --> 01:00:46.904
Ah. Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:49.841
It's gonna be all right, Adam.

01:00:49.842 --> 01:00:52.243
- Adam, it's gonna be all right.
- What shall we do

01:00:52.244 --> 01:00:54.946
to help Jules make amends?

01:00:54.947 --> 01:00:57.915
Cut her fucking tongue out!

01:00:59.384 --> 01:01:01.185
I guess blood isn't
so thick after all.

01:01:01.186 --> 01:01:03.221
- Fuck you.
- I like your style, Adam.

01:01:03.222 --> 01:01:06.591
Tongue... that is how
you castrate a lesbian.

01:01:06.592 --> 01:01:08.259
Come back, movie, please come back.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.261
Come back, movie, please come back.

01:01:10.262 --> 01:01:12.063
Come back, movie, please come back.

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:14.265
What, Adam.

01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:17.869
- How could you?
- What, Sara?

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.303
Jules didn't do anything wrong.

01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:26.577
Bystander apathy is an epidemic.

01:01:26.578 --> 01:01:29.914
People standing by while
someone is assaulted

01:01:29.915 --> 01:01:33.083
and not doing anything about it...

01:01:34.552 --> 01:01:38.155
It happens every day
and it makes me sick.

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:41.926
God, Bernadette,
you are so full of shit.

01:01:41.927 --> 01:01:44.095
What are you doing tonight?
It's the same thing, right?

01:01:44.096 --> 01:01:45.997
You're just making it so
we can't help our friends.

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:48.099
Tonight doesn't count.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.467
All of the days before tonight do.

01:01:51.636 --> 01:01:54.639
Jules didn't do
anything to help Lily.

01:01:57.943 --> 01:02:00.578
- And Lily...
- Lily was a victim!

01:02:00.579 --> 01:02:04.982
Lily didn't have to stay a victim.

01:02:04.983 --> 01:02:08.319
She didn't have to
create more victims,

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.522
but she wasn't going to do anything
and begged me not to either.

01:02:14.425 --> 01:02:17.128
You know, there's this myth

01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:19.964
that a rapist is some evil stranger

01:02:19.965 --> 01:02:22.700
hiding in a dark alley.

01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:26.302
Most rapes are committed
by someone the person knew...

01:02:27.271 --> 01:02:29.174
someone they trusted.

01:02:29.675 --> 01:02:31.609
Family member, even.

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:35.145
It usually happens more than once.

01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:40.183
I was supposed to live with that?

01:02:41.252 --> 01:02:44.654
Knowing that Adam would
probably do it again?

01:02:46.657 --> 01:02:49.193
That's on my conscience.

01:02:49.194 --> 01:02:51.128
That's my karma.

01:02:51.129 --> 01:02:53.731
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
your karma is fucked.

01:02:53.732 --> 01:02:58.035
What the hell did I do
to deserve any of this?

01:02:58.036 --> 01:03:00.972
You didn't know I was
looking at Blane's emails

01:03:00.973 --> 01:03:03.040
before 10 minutes ago.

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:05.441
What did I do, Bernadette?

01:03:06.477 --> 01:03:10.314
You introduced me to
these fucking people.

01:03:10.315 --> 01:03:13.216
So you're gonna kill me?

01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:18.122
Do you think they deserve
what they've gotten tonight?

01:03:18.123 --> 01:03:20.992
Never in a million years.

01:03:20.993 --> 01:03:23.995
Then you're just another
victim waiting to happen.

01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:31.435
Shut up, Blane.

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:35.573
No, it's not that black and white.

01:03:35.574 --> 01:03:40.044
It is always and only black or white.

01:03:40.045 --> 01:03:42.079
Where are the goddamn scissors?

01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:51.421
Glad you could join us, Lily.

01:03:55.192 --> 01:03:57.760
Come on, Lily.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:03:59.764 --> 01:04:03.067
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- She's fucking crazy.

01:04:03.068 --> 01:04:06.136
I'm just gonna slice
your fucking face off.

01:04:06.837 --> 01:04:09.774
- Lily! God!
- Lily!

01:04:09.775 --> 01:04:12.309
Get her! No!

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:14.812
- Come on, Lil!
- Get her!

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:19.582
I'm sorry, Sara.

01:04:20.518 --> 01:04:22.420
Fight back! Lily!

01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:25.790
- Kill her!
- Come on!

01:04:25.791 --> 01:04:28.826
- Get fucking help, you...
- You suck, Lily!

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:31.729
- Your friends suck.
- No, they don't!

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:33.097
- Lily, come on!
- Come on, get her!

01:04:33.098 --> 01:04:35.466
Now the party's over.

01:04:35.467 --> 01:04:37.802
- Get up!
- Come on, get up!

01:04:37.803 --> 01:04:40.838
- Ah!
- Get her! Get up!

01:04:44.843 --> 01:04:49.246
Lily, come on!
Knock her the fuck out!

01:04:49.247 --> 01:04:53.117
- Get off me!
- Get her now!

01:04:54.118 --> 01:04:56.653
Go! Get her!

01:04:58.122 --> 01:05:00.390
Fucking kill her!

01:05:01.192 --> 01:05:03.094
Yeah, fucking choke her!

01:05:03.095 --> 01:05:06.430
Fucking bitch!

01:05:12.136 --> 01:05:13.870
Thank God!

01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:17.108
Come on, get up! Come on!

01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:18.876
- Come on, Lily.
- Is she dead?

01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:21.512
Fucking stab her.

01:05:21.513 --> 01:05:23.848
Get the tape. It's in the case.

01:05:23.849 --> 01:05:26.217
- Over there. Get it.
- Over here, come on!

01:05:26.218 --> 01:05:28.652
- Come on.
- Tie her up.

01:05:28.653 --> 01:05:30.788
Get the tape!

01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:32.556
Right, the tape.

01:05:32.557 --> 01:05:35.860
- Hurry up, let's go!
- Hurry, hurry!

01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:37.862
- Tie her up, please.
- Tie up the crazy girl on the floor.

01:05:37.863 --> 01:05:40.396
She's crazy.

01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:43.065
Faster!

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:47.138
- Come on.
- Christ, come on, Lily. Come on.

01:05:47.139 --> 01:05:50.341
- Tighter, tighter.
- Get her feet! Come on, yeah!

01:05:50.342 --> 01:05:53.377
- Tie her up.
- Come on, hurry up!

01:05:53.378 --> 01:05:57.148
- Come on, yeah.
- Hurry.

01:05:57.149 --> 01:05:59.750
A little faster, please! Hello?!

01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:01.852
- Come on!
- Cut us loose, come on!

01:06:01.853 --> 01:06:04.922
Is it secure?

01:06:04.923 --> 01:06:07.925
Yeah! Whoo!

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:11.195
- Lily, I'm gonna need you to...
- Come on, let's go!

01:06:11.196 --> 01:06:13.194
- Hurry up!
- ...get the hammer.

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:15.900
- Get the... get the scissors.
- Lily, I need you to do this.

01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:18.736
It's not an option! Hammer!

01:06:18.737 --> 01:06:20.571
- Lily, cut us out!
- Let's go, Lily!

01:06:20.572 --> 01:06:23.975
- Get the fucking hammer!
- Hurry up!

01:06:24.376 --> 01:06:27.278
- Come on, hurry up.
- Come on!

01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:30.347
- That's the one. Yeah!
- Yeah, that's the one!

01:06:30.348 --> 01:06:32.349
- Yes!
- Come on.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:34.418
Come on.

01:06:34.419 --> 01:06:35.953
Please use the other side.

01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:38.355
- I told you, I'm not good at this.
- Other side.

01:06:38.356 --> 01:06:40.624
Yes, fuck it, yes. That's it.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:42.493
Okay.

01:06:42.494 --> 01:06:44.228
Ah ah!

01:06:44.929 --> 01:06:46.931
Hurry up!

01:06:47.932 --> 01:06:52.536
- Come on, Lily. You can do it.
- Why did she do all of this?

01:06:52.537 --> 01:06:55.406
Just pull it up! Pull it up, come on!

01:06:57.909 --> 01:07:01.512
She has this grandiose
idea about integrity

01:07:01.513 --> 01:07:05.382
and ridding the world of bad friends.

01:07:05.383 --> 01:07:08.719
And she's been watching
us with cameras.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:13.591
Anyway, she made us watch
movies of ourselves

01:07:13.592 --> 01:07:16.260
doing really shitty things.

01:07:16.261 --> 01:07:22.233
Like Marcus spying on Jules eating
Sara out and jerking off to it.

01:07:22.234 --> 01:07:24.001
And Melanie fucking Blane...

01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:25.903
and Adam at the same time.

01:07:25.904 --> 01:07:27.937
I didn't fuck Adam.

01:07:29.273 --> 01:07:31.774
And Adam raping you!

01:07:33.577 --> 01:07:35.746
Why didn't you say anything?

01:07:35.747 --> 01:07:38.616
Yeah, Lil, why didn't you tell me?

01:07:38.617 --> 01:07:40.251
You needed an abortion?

01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:42.286
Side note... you went to Bernadette?

01:07:42.287 --> 01:07:44.688
We've been friends for a
really fucking long time.

01:07:44.689 --> 01:07:47.167
- Yeah, Lil, why didn't you come to me?
- That's fucked up.

01:07:47.168 --> 01:07:49.026
Are we really talking
about this right now?

01:07:49.027 --> 01:07:52.563
- Yes.
- I'm just saying.

01:07:52.564 --> 01:07:56.933
I didn't want anyone to know, okay?

01:08:01.305 --> 01:08:05.342
And I just figured Bernie
could keep it a secret,

01:08:05.343 --> 01:08:07.911
because she does that
with her patients.

01:08:15.452 --> 01:08:18.522
I'm sorry, Lil. I'm sorry.

01:08:18.523 --> 01:08:21.122
I didn't know what to do.

01:08:23.861 --> 01:08:25.062
I'm sorry.

01:08:25.063 --> 01:08:27.564
Jules.

01:08:27.564 --> 01:08:31.501
Wait, what... what do you mean?

01:08:36.407 --> 01:08:39.042
What does she mean?!

01:08:39.044 --> 01:08:42.578
Jules heard Adam while he was
in the bathroom with you

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.115
and she didn't know
what to do, so she left.

01:08:57.394 --> 01:09:00.563
You knew he was raping me...

01:09:01.497 --> 01:09:04.300
and you didn't do anything?

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.541
Okay.

01:09:14.745 --> 01:09:17.413
Okay.

01:09:17.415 --> 01:09:19.450
Who else knew?!

01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:21.452
Nobody knew, okay, Lily? Nobody knew.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:24.185
We found out tonight.
Just cut... just cut us free.

01:09:31.895 --> 01:09:33.696
I'm...

01:09:34.497 --> 01:09:36.599
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.136 --> 01:09:40.904
Sorry?

01:09:40.904 --> 01:09:42.904
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.108 --> 01:09:46.075
I'm sorry too.

01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:50.145
And you're sorry?

01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:56.619
Who are you people?

01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:11.602
"Sorry" is for things

01:10:11.603 --> 01:10:14.772
like bumping into someone

01:10:14.773 --> 01:10:17.608
- or breaking a glass...
- Lily!

01:10:17.609 --> 01:10:21.612
...or being late for a
fucking appointment!

01:10:21.613 --> 01:10:25.114
Come on, Lily, don't do
this right now, okay?

01:10:30.187 --> 01:10:31.954
You deserve that.

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:36.493
Adam didn't deserve that.

01:10:36.494 --> 01:10:38.095
- He doesn't?
- No.

01:10:38.096 --> 01:10:41.465
What does he deserve? Nothing?

01:10:41.466 --> 01:10:45.636
Because the truth is he wasn't
sorry until he got caught.

01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:50.706
He wasn't sorry while he was
forcing himself onto me.

01:10:51.475 --> 01:10:54.878
He wasn't sorry, uh, yesterday.

01:10:54.879 --> 01:10:56.747
- He wasn't sorry...
- We don't know that.

01:10:56.748 --> 01:10:58.615
Are you defending him?

01:10:58.616 --> 01:11:01.452
No! I'm just saying...

01:11:01.453 --> 01:11:03.854
You're just saying that it's okay?!

01:11:03.855 --> 01:11:07.791
No, please! We need help, Lily.

01:11:07.792 --> 01:11:10.993
You know what?

01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:19.169
I was gonna tell you.

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:22.840
I just didn't think that
you would believe me.

01:11:24.175 --> 01:11:28.310
I... I knew you wouldn't
believe me, Sara.

01:11:30.047 --> 01:11:32.516
Lily?

01:11:32.517 --> 01:11:35.185
Cut us loose.

01:11:35.186 --> 01:11:36.920
Please.

01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:38.821
Yeah.

01:12:05.716 --> 01:12:07.518
Bernadette...

01:12:07.519 --> 01:12:09.719
She-she-she... she is right.

01:12:10.254 --> 01:12:12.256
You suck.

01:12:12.257 --> 01:12:14.091
And you suck!

01:12:14.092 --> 01:12:16.092
You all suck.

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.832
Lily?

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:57.734
Fuck.

01:12:57.735 --> 01:12:58.869
Lily?

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:00.571
Lily?

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.641
- Lily? Lily?
- Lily!

01:13:04.642 --> 01:13:09.680
Lily! Lily! Lily!

01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:14.016
Lily! Lily! Lily!

01:13:20.124 --> 01:13:22.458
Fuck!

01:13:55.993 --> 01:13:58.729
<i>Oversensitive,
everything remains relative</i>

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:01.898
<i>Conservative relationships,
acting out like a sedative</i>

01:14:01.899 --> 01:14:05.068
<i>Over and under the
influence of barbiturates</i>

01:14:05.069 --> 01:14:08.205
<i>Deep dead, damn, I feel
sorry for college graduates</i>

01:14:08.206 --> 01:14:11.008
<i>It blows my mind</i>

01:14:11.009 --> 01:14:14.177
<i>Every single time</i>

01:14:14.178 --> 01:14:17.414
<i>Now you're all dead</i>

01:14:17.415 --> 01:14:20.951
<i>And think you've got an edge</i>

01:14:20.952 --> 01:14:24.054
<i>While we swim</i>

01:14:24.055 --> 01:14:27.658
<i>For someone else's breath</i>

01:14:27.659 --> 01:14:30.761
<i>I will lay in my bed</i>

01:14:30.762 --> 01:14:33.697
<i>I'll get my own instead</i>

01:14:33.698 --> 01:14:36.867
<i>Everybody's fucking with my mind</i>

01:14:36.868 --> 01:14:39.403
<i>Everybody's fucking with my mind</i>

01:14:39.404 --> 01:14:43.373
<i>Everybody's fucking with my mind</i>

01:14:43.374 --> 01:14:46.276
<i>Everybody's fucking with my mind</i>

01:14:46.277 --> 01:14:48.244
<i>Hey!</i>

01:14:56.318 --> 01:15:00.857
<i>Can I go now?</i>

01:15:00.858 --> 01:15:03.694
<i>Leave me alone now...</i>

01:15:05.163 --> 01:15:10.434
<i>Can I get away?</i>

01:15:10.435 --> 01:15:13.470
<i>Must stay</i>

01:15:13.471 --> 01:15:17.174
<i>I used to be invisible</i>

01:15:17.175 --> 01:15:20.110
<i>I used to hold my own...</i>

01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:22.479
- What can I get for you?
- Double whiskey, rocks.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.481
Sure.

01:15:24.482 --> 01:15:28.017
<i>I've fallen in love</i>

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:32.355
<i>First a virtuoso</i>

01:15:32.356 --> 01:15:36.226
<i>Now a beast so cold</i>

01:15:36.227 --> 01:15:40.030
<i>Broken down, I'm at your</i>

01:15:40.031 --> 01:15:43.934
<i>Mercy</i>

01:15:43.935 --> 01:15:47.370
<i>At some point you took away...
You took away</i>

01:15:47.371 --> 01:15:51.241
<i>My power</i>

01:15:51.242 --> 01:15:55.412
<i>Boy, you force me, you force me...</i>

01:15:57.415 --> 01:15:59.516
- Hello?
- Hey, girl!

01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:01.318
I just got the invitation.

01:16:01.319 --> 01:16:03.787
So fun! Murder-mystery party!

01:16:03.788 --> 01:16:05.756
I love it! And I love the theme.

01:16:05.757 --> 01:16:08.158
Oh, my God, you are
a fucking crazy bitch.

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:13.096
Oh, invite Stacy. I'd love to see her
fat ass squeeze into a flapper dress.

01:16:13.097 --> 01:16:14.498
Just invite some hot guys for me.

01:16:14.499 --> 01:16:15.999
That's all I care about.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.868
Hello?

01:16:17.869 --> 01:16:19.770
Are you there? Hello?

01:16:19.771 --> 01:16:22.506
Fucking phone.
Am I talking to myself?

01:16:37.187 --> 01:16:40.891
<i>From the seas</i>

01:16:40.892 --> 01:16:44.194
<i>To the serpentine</i>

01:16:44.195 --> 01:16:47.564
<i>From the bees</i>

01:16:47.565 --> 01:16:50.867
<i>To your knees</i>

01:16:50.868 --> 01:16:54.237
<i>From the trees</i>

01:16:54.238 --> 01:16:57.908
<i>In the sunshine</i>

01:16:57.909 --> 01:17:02.544
<i>It doesn't even matter 'cause you
never really get very far...</i>

01:17:04.915 --> 01:17:08.051
<i>- From the seas...
- Sat at the bar with a skull mask on</i>

01:17:08.052 --> 01:17:11.555
<i>Sipped iced tea to my favorite song</i>

01:17:11.556 --> 01:17:13.456
<i>Went for a walk</i>

01:17:13.457 --> 01:17:16.525
<i>Saw a bride and groom in the park</i>

01:17:18.528 --> 01:17:21.932
<i>Mashed potatoes, Uncle Sam</i>

01:17:21.933 --> 01:17:25.368
<i>Apple pie, honey-baked ham</i>

01:17:25.369 --> 01:17:29.738
<i>It doesn't even matter, 'cause
you never really get very far</i>

01:17:31.842 --> 01:17:35.579
<i>- From the seas...
- Sat at the bar with a skull mask on</i>

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:39.049
<i>Sipped iced tea to my favorite song</i>

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:40.951
<i>Went for a walk</i>

01:17:40.952 --> 01:17:43.519
<i>Saw a bride and groom in the park</i>

01:17:45.622 --> 01:17:49.125
<i>Corn chips, dapper Dan</i>

01:17:49.126 --> 01:17:52.896
<i>Gumdrops, tasty lamb</i>

01:17:52.897 --> 01:17:56.566
<i>It doesn't even matter, 'cause
you never really get very far.</i>

01:18:19.957 --> 01:18:22.459
<i>Sadie is crazy</i>

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.629
<i>She likes to lick the ladies</i>

01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:28.632
<i>And cocoa bites my toes</i>

01:18:28.633 --> 01:18:31.034
<i>And Lola loves the window</i>

01:18:31.035 --> 01:18:35.238
<i>But they don't get along...</i>
