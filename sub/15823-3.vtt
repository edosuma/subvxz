WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:12.060
Oh, honey. Uh, you're home.

00:12.228 --> 00:15.493
I called your cell. Where were you?

00:15.765 --> 00:18.165
<i>Uh, I sort of ate.</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:22.064
- I could pull out the menus if you want.
- No, thanks. I lost my appetite.

00:22.238 --> 00:23.296
About an hour ago.

00:23.473 --> 00:26.909
Around the time your friend
Captain Raydor showed up at my office.

00:28.344 --> 00:29.641
Oh?

00:29.813 --> 00:33.374
Apparently my wife is being vetted
for chief of police.

00:33.983 --> 00:35.644
I didn't even know she was running.

00:35.819 --> 00:36.877
I'm not.

00:37.053 --> 00:40.614
Look. See?
I haven't even turned in my application.

00:41.391 --> 00:43.325
- <i>How long have you known?</i>
- <i>About a week.</i>

00:43.493 --> 00:47.554
A week? Do you have any idea
how humiliating it is...

00:47.731 --> 00:50.757
...being blindsided with questions
about my DUl's...

00:50.934 --> 00:53.562
...and how many AA meetings
I attend each week?

00:53.737 --> 00:55.261
I had no idea she'd talk to you.

00:55.438 --> 00:58.168
This is one of the most powerful
positions in the city.

00:58.341 --> 01:00.673
People make sure your husband
isn't a liability.

01:00.844 --> 01:03.836
The only reason Raydor
is pushing me for this is I'm a woman...

01:04.013 --> 01:06.106
<i>...and to make trouble between</i>
<i>me and Pope.</i>

01:06.282 --> 01:09.979
Besides, you were up for promotion
last year and never said a word about it.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.919
- I never considered it seriously.
- I'm not considering this seriously, either.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.320
- Really?
- Really.

01:22.599 --> 01:24.123
Why not?

01:24.300 --> 01:27.758
Getting some emotional distance
from your cases would be good for you.

01:27.937 --> 01:30.337
It would be safer.
This job comes with bodyguards.

01:31.775 --> 01:33.970
What about your career?
Chief is a commitment.

01:34.144 --> 01:35.338
Don't make this about me.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.878
You couldn't take another job
for five years.

01:38.047 --> 01:40.140
There's those events
and dinners to go to.

01:40.316 --> 01:42.546
As opposed to the crime scenes
you go to now.

01:42.752 --> 01:45.346
And what about Pope?
He's had his heart set on this.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.990
What about Pope?
Who cares about Pope?

01:49.058 --> 01:52.050
Who would...?
Who would take over Major Crimes?

01:52.996 --> 01:54.964
Ah. Okay, now we're getting to it.

01:55.131 --> 01:57.622
For starters, you got three lieutenants.
Promote one of them.

01:59.269 --> 02:01.601
Oh, right, like it's that easy.
Who would I choose?

02:01.771 --> 02:04.899
And there's civil service issues.
It requires bureaucratic rigmarole...

02:05.074 --> 02:08.339
- Do not answer that phone.
...that you don't even know about.

02:08.511 --> 02:10.205
Yes, detective, hello. What is it?

02:11.014 --> 02:14.814
Evening, chief. We got rolled out
to cover for Hollywood tonight.

02:14.984 --> 02:16.918
They're all at a retirement party.

02:17.086 --> 02:20.749
Brenda, we have to finish this discussion.
I am serious. This is important.

02:20.924 --> 02:23.893
Anyway, it's a, uh, probable suicide.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.426
We still have to establish
a time of death...

02:26.596 --> 02:28.587
We're talking about a job I don't want.

02:28.798 --> 02:31.232
<i>Why? This could be an amazing</i>
<i>opportunity for you.</i>

02:31.434 --> 02:34.494
- That's what I'm saying.
- Chief, are you there?

02:34.671 --> 02:38.607
Shh! They know nothing about this chief
business, okay? Just one second.

02:38.808 --> 02:41.242
Yes, detective.
Just start knocking on doors...

02:41.411 --> 02:45.541
...and let's confirm suicide before
we jump to any conclusions, okay?

02:45.715 --> 02:48.206
- I will be there in...
- Provenza can handle a suicide.

02:48.384 --> 02:51.410
- This is an important conversation.
- Ha, ha. They're fighting.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.748
We are not fighting.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.913
- Now they think we're fighting.
- We are.

02:56.025 --> 02:57.925
- Evening, chief.
- Delegate and hang up.

02:58.094 --> 03:02.861
Chief. Really, uh, we're almost done here.
There's no need to ruin your evening.

03:03.032 --> 03:05.796
Apparently the victim's boyfriend
called it in.

03:05.969 --> 03:09.063
He just so happens to live
in the second floor of that building.

03:09.239 --> 03:11.036
- Just bring him down, huh?
- What?

03:11.207 --> 03:14.904
- What's that, lieutenant? I can't hear you.
- Uh, nothing. Nothing, chief.

03:15.078 --> 03:16.875
Listen, I have this, okay?

03:17.046 --> 03:19.412
- So why don't you just...
- Hang up.

03:19.582 --> 03:22.574
...go do whatever you're doing?
- Hang up. Hang up.

03:23.553 --> 03:29.788
- Um, if it's anything serious, I'll call you.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.756
- Hang up.
- Don't hang up.

03:33.263 --> 03:35.629
- He hung up.
- Good.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.474 --> 03:46.908
I'm gonna be a few minutes.
Keep the doors locked.

03:47.510 --> 03:50.070
- You want anything?
- No, I'm good. But it's cold.

03:54.684 --> 03:56.777
Here you go.

03:58.254 --> 04:00.916
Gina Decker. Age 27.

04:01.090 --> 04:04.253
- Is this her car?
- No. The car's registered to Wayne West.

04:04.427 --> 04:07.521
- Her boyfriend's name is Wayne.
- Yeah. Flynn's bringing him down.

04:07.697 --> 04:09.722
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I was at the movies.

04:09.899 --> 04:13.335
- Ah. Yeah? Got a hot date or something?
- Uh, no, sir.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.961
Looking at the blood, there's
an absence of high-velocity misting...

04:17.140 --> 04:19.665
...inconsistent with a self-inflicted
gunshot wound.

04:19.841 --> 04:20.866
Shorter words, Tao.

04:21.043 --> 04:24.013
If she pulled the trigger,
there'd be blowback on her hand.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.670
Buzz, you getting this? Huh? Huh?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.713
Yes, sir.

04:29.485 --> 04:32.886
Wait. So you're saying you think
the driver shot her and left the gun?

04:33.056 --> 04:34.546
Look at the spatter here, huh?

04:34.724 --> 04:36.487
Nobody was sitting here.

04:36.659 --> 04:39.560
Uh, excuse me, sir. Step back.

04:39.729 --> 04:43.722
Maybe the driver got out of the car...

04:43.933 --> 04:48.131
...and then shot her
through the open window.

04:48.304 --> 04:51.740
- Well, where is this boyfriend, huh?
- Wayne West, meet my pals.

04:51.908 --> 04:53.967
Ah. Thank you for joining us, Mr. West.

04:54.143 --> 04:55.303
You look damp.

04:55.478 --> 04:58.311
- Do you need a towel?
- Uh, no, man. No.

04:58.481 --> 05:01.245
- Is this your car?
- Yeah, it is.

05:01.451 --> 05:05.410
Yeah, you discovered your girlfriend's
body in it earlier this evening?

05:05.588 --> 05:06.987
I did. Right.

05:07.156 --> 05:08.919
- And then you called the police.
- Mm-hm.

05:09.092 --> 05:11.492
Then you thought
you would freshen up a bit...

05:11.694 --> 05:13.685
...uh, maybe take a shower before
we got here?

05:14.197 --> 05:15.994
Was that a mistake?

05:16.966 --> 05:20.367
Mr. West, uh, we need you to come
downtown, make a statement.

05:20.536 --> 05:23.505
Really? Why? You know,
I can make a statement right here.

05:23.673 --> 05:29.771
I was out with a friend. I came home.
I found Gina dead in my car. That's it.

05:29.979 --> 05:33.847
See, we hate to leave the victim's
loved ones behind at the scene...

05:34.017 --> 05:36.178
...especially when they're upset.
- Right.

05:36.352 --> 05:38.513
- Or are you just on edge?
- Or on something.

05:38.688 --> 05:43.182
You told me she killed herself. You act
like I had something to do with it.

05:43.359 --> 05:45.224
Oh, the thought never crossed
my mind.

05:45.395 --> 05:47.420
Although she is
in front of your apartment.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.088
- She lives here.
- In the passenger seat of your car.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.426
That's her seat.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.502
Julio, I gotta go to the bathroom.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.708
- Lieutenants?
- Hey!

06:06.549 --> 06:08.039
I got him. I got him. Damn it.

06:08.217 --> 06:10.412
Detective.

06:11.788 --> 06:16.350
Are you telling me that you have been
holding on to this kid for a week?

06:16.559 --> 06:18.322
- Yes, sir.
- Hey. Hey.

06:18.494 --> 06:22.021
Keep it down!
People are trying to sleep around here.

06:26.102 --> 06:28.935
Thought I made it clear
that you were to turn Ruben over...

06:29.105 --> 06:31.471
...to the Department of Children's
Services.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.109
I got approved
for emergency foster care instead.

06:34.277 --> 06:37.246
When you were supposed to search
for his mother in Mexico.

06:37.413 --> 06:41.076
This boy is intimately involved
in a case that is officially still open.

06:41.250 --> 06:44.242
And we are responsible
for his father's death.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.911
The FBI shot Ruben's father, not us.

06:47.090 --> 06:49.115
I know your intentions are good,
Julio...

06:49.325 --> 06:51.816
...and I'm not unsympathetic
to Ruben's situation...

06:51.994 --> 06:54.189
This isn't the proper environment
for a child.

06:54.363 --> 06:56.490
- Worked out okay for your niece.
- Watch it.

06:58.201 --> 07:00.101
It is 2:00 in the morning, detective.

07:00.269 --> 07:02.965
I hardly think that the scene of a murder
or a suicide...

07:03.139 --> 07:06.438
...is any place for a child
who just attended his father's funeral.

07:06.609 --> 07:10.045
We were at the movies.
I had no time to drop him at my mom's.

07:10.213 --> 07:13.148
I don't think you understand
what you're getting into, Julio.

07:13.316 --> 07:15.113
That boy deserves more than you can...

07:15.284 --> 07:18.515
Sir, you think he's better off
in the system instead of with me?

07:19.622 --> 07:21.089
My whole family is helping out.

07:21.257 --> 07:23.657
What might happen if Ruben
grows attached to you?

07:23.826 --> 07:26.761
If you're unable to find his mother,
he ends up in the system.

07:26.929 --> 07:29.727
- I will find her.
- I certainly hope so.

07:32.435 --> 07:34.369
Excuse me.

07:35.872 --> 07:41.208
As the gun moves closer to
the head, say, between to 6 to 18 inches...

07:41.377 --> 07:45.313
...there's a slight gun-powder stippling
at the point of entry.

07:45.481 --> 07:49.212
When that stippling is more concentrated,
as in the case of the deceased...

07:49.385 --> 07:52.877
...the gun was fired
1 to 6 inches from the skull...

07:53.055 --> 07:55.580
...which is consistent
with a self-inflicted wound.

07:55.758 --> 07:59.592
Do you believe this? The good doctor
wants to call our victim's death a suicide.

07:59.762 --> 08:01.024
And why shouldn't I?

08:01.197 --> 08:04.394
The body had no signs of a struggle
and she clearly didn't duck.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.400
The boyfriend, Wayne West,
has a healthy criminal record...

08:07.570 --> 08:09.435
...that consists of a history of abuse.

08:09.639 --> 08:13.097
- And he tried to flee the crime scene.
- Ditching this meth along the way.

08:13.276 --> 08:15.836
- Oh, what happened to your head?
- Oh, it's nothing.

08:16.012 --> 08:18.173
I kissed the pavement when
I tackled that guy.

08:18.347 --> 08:20.838
"Kissed the pavement." Listen to him.

08:24.420 --> 08:29.050
Don't you think it's a little awkward that
she held the gun away from her head?

08:29.225 --> 08:33.684
It's not uncommon for someone
to reconsider at the last moment.

08:33.863 --> 08:36.457
Would you mind doing
a tox screen for meth...

08:36.666 --> 08:39.464
...before your determination?
- Looking for an overdose?

08:39.669 --> 08:42.900
I'm pretty certain it was the hole
in her head that killed her.

08:43.072 --> 08:46.405
I'd like more time to figure out
how she got that hole to begin with.

08:46.576 --> 08:47.702
That's all.

08:47.877 --> 08:49.811
You. Stay.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.583
Chief, Mr. West has been read his rights
and he's dying to talk to you.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.677
Thank you, commander.

08:59.555 --> 09:02.547
- I can't believe she blew her brains out.
- Don't look at that.

09:02.725 --> 09:04.056
Right this way.

09:04.227 --> 09:06.388
That's just very upsetting.

09:06.562 --> 09:07.654
Detective?

09:07.830 --> 09:12.130
It's a tragedy, man. But I guess
Gina was going through some things.

09:14.937 --> 09:17.303
Gentlemen, this way.

09:18.774 --> 09:20.969
Just have a seat.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.642
Thank you.

09:23.813 --> 09:29.809
So, uh, Mr. West, you were saying that
Gina was going through a lot recently.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.183
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Stuff with her kid, you know.

09:33.356 --> 09:37.122
Her asshole ex-husband was suing
for permanent custody.

09:37.293 --> 09:40.660
Said that Gina wasn't fit to be a mom,
because she was a druggie.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.493
So the judge told her,
"Clean up, or else."

09:44.667 --> 09:47.363
- And did she?
- Hell, yeah.

09:47.536 --> 09:49.800
Just got back from rehab last week.

09:49.972 --> 09:52.839
Mr. West, earlier this evening,
you told my detectives...

09:53.009 --> 09:55.637
...that you were out
during the time of Gina's death.

09:55.811 --> 09:58.245
Is there someone we can talk to
that can confirm?

10:00.049 --> 10:02.017
Still not buying
the whole suicide angle?

10:03.519 --> 10:06.283
We're exploring all possibilities,
Mr. West.

10:06.455 --> 10:09.447
Okay, talk to my buddy, Paul.

10:11.394 --> 10:15.023
Um, Paul Olson.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.529
I was with him until I called you guys.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.225
I can give you his number.

10:20.403 --> 10:23.236
I didn't do this. I love Gina.

10:23.406 --> 10:24.430
Uh-huh.

10:27.677 --> 10:30.339
Uh, you know what else?
Now that I think of it...

10:30.513 --> 10:32.981
...you should talk to, um,
her ex-husband too.

10:33.149 --> 10:36.880
The last thing that dude wanted
was for her to get visitation ever again...

10:37.086 --> 10:39.611
...let alone custody to their daughter,
you know?

10:39.822 --> 10:42.689
I mean, that's what you're looking for,
right? Motive?

10:42.858 --> 10:44.883
I mean, I didn't have any motive,
you know?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.552
And why would I leave her body
outside of our place?

10:47.763 --> 10:51.699
Me, I would take it out to the desert,
pour gravy on it, let coyotes do the rest.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.391
You know, that way: "Pfft!"

10:53.602 --> 10:55.263
You know? Just gone.

10:55.438 --> 10:57.303
Wow. Wow.

10:57.473 --> 11:01.136
- Uh, you've got your plan figured out.
- No, I think things through.

11:02.144 --> 11:03.702
I can see that, yes.

11:04.313 --> 11:08.647
Uh, so that cop told me
that I had the right to remain silent.

11:08.851 --> 11:11.752
- So when does that start?
- Oh, any time now.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.254
You also have the right to an attorney,
because you are under arrest.

11:15.424 --> 11:16.755
What? Why?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.587
For possession of methamphetamine.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.785
Sleep tight, Mr. West.

11:19.962 --> 11:21.657
- Detective, would you?
- Come on.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.730
Put your hands behind your back, please.

11:27.636 --> 11:31.037
- Ow. Be gentle.
- Just don't get junkie on me, okay?

11:31.207 --> 11:33.698
- Come on, man.
- This is a new suit.

11:38.047 --> 11:40.345
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.952
Morning, Chief Johnson.
Everything all right?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.560
Just missing the old building.

11:52.728 --> 11:55.356
Parking three blocks away does
take getting used to.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.827
Ah, man.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.764
Pretty exciting about Pope,
don't you think?

12:02.938 --> 12:07.102
I mean, he is the closest thing to a lock
for chief of police I can think of.

12:07.276 --> 12:11.406
Oh, I don't know. The commission has
a lot of candidates they're considering.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.548
It's Pope. Trust me.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.715
- You know what that means?
- What?

12:16.886 --> 12:20.049
Musical chairs.
Everybody changes jobs.

12:20.222 --> 12:24.556
In fact, you could become
the new assistant chief...

12:24.727 --> 12:27.992
...especially with L.A.P.D.'s emphasis
on diversity.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.893
Pope's number two.

12:30.065 --> 12:33.728
- That would be a nice position for you.
- Would it?

12:33.903 --> 12:39.603
And should you be promoted, I would
be honored to take over Major Crimes.

12:39.775 --> 12:41.299
Oh. Ha, ha.

12:41.477 --> 12:46.278
That would be... That would be
something to consider.

12:46.449 --> 12:49.612
I have been, um, thinking about
who would replace me...

12:49.785 --> 12:52.345
...if I were to become unavailable.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.922
The more seamless
we make these transitions, the better.

12:56.091 --> 12:58.719
I mean, who's closer to Major Crimes
than me?

13:00.429 --> 13:01.953
Oh. Excuse me.

13:02.131 --> 13:04.622
Well, thank you, commander,
for thinking ahead.

13:06.168 --> 13:09.604
- Uh, yes, lieutenant. What is it?
- I got an address on the ex-husband.

13:09.772 --> 13:13.970
- I can send Gabriel if you want.
- Oh, yes. Tell the detective I'll be right...

13:15.211 --> 13:18.703
You got three lieutenants in your squad.
Promote one of them.

13:21.450 --> 13:25.443
Actually, no. Lieutenant, I'd like you
to join me for this notification.

13:25.621 --> 13:29.113
- <i>I'll meet you at your car. Okay?</i>
- Sure.

13:31.494 --> 13:35.430
As assistant chief, you get your own
parking space right here in the building.

13:49.044 --> 13:51.239
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:52.014 --> 13:55.711
I'm Lieutenant Flynn, this is
Deputy Chief Johnson from the L.A.P.D.

13:55.885 --> 13:57.375
Is, uh, Darren Tatem here?

14:01.624 --> 14:03.148
Here you go, my girl.

14:04.226 --> 14:05.887
My dad's making his music.

14:06.061 --> 14:08.552
When I dance to it, he cracks up.
Ha, ha.

14:08.731 --> 14:10.255
You must have some great moves.

14:10.466 --> 14:12.161
- What's your name?
- Cody.

14:12.334 --> 14:14.529
May I ask what this is regarding?

14:14.703 --> 14:18.161
Yes. Uh, we have some information
for Mr. Tatem, ma'am.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.774
Well, his doctor wants him
to take it easy...

14:20.976 --> 14:24.104
...but I suppose a few minutes
wouldn't hurt, huh?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.214
He's just down the hall.

14:28.050 --> 14:30.780
- Is he sick?
- Um, you could say that, yes.

14:34.523 --> 14:35.717
Daddy.

14:37.026 --> 14:39.119
Daddy, police officers.

14:52.274 --> 14:55.801
Hello, Mr. Tatem. I'm Deputy Chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.

14:56.011 --> 14:57.569
And this is Lieutenant Flynn.

14:57.746 --> 15:00.078
We're so sorry to bother you
this morning.

15:00.249 --> 15:02.240
We're hoping you'd answer
a few questions.

15:02.785 --> 15:04.753
- Sure. I guess.
- Anything I can get you?

15:04.920 --> 15:06.820
No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks.

15:07.022 --> 15:09.547
- You go with Grandma, okay?
- Okay.

15:09.725 --> 15:11.249
Come on, my sweet girl.

15:11.427 --> 15:13.258
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.301
Lymphoma. Mom and Dad
help me fight the good fight.

15:20.469 --> 15:22.437
- You play beautifully.
- Thank you.

15:22.605 --> 15:24.937
It's part of a score
I'm rushing to finish.

15:25.107 --> 15:27.769
- Do all your work here?
- Yeah, I don't get out much now.

15:27.943 --> 15:31.140
I imagine these are not the questions
that you came here to ask.

15:33.282 --> 15:35.978
How are things between you
and your ex-wife, Mr. Tatem?

15:36.151 --> 15:39.985
- Strained. Why?
- When was the last time you saw her?

15:40.155 --> 15:43.147
I don't know. About a week ago,
when she got out of rehab.

15:43.325 --> 15:44.792
Why? What happened?

15:44.960 --> 15:48.487
I'm afraid we have some bad news
for you and your daughter, Mr. Tatem.

15:48.664 --> 15:50.427
Gina was found dead last night.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.062
And the bad news is?

15:57.006 --> 16:00.203
Sorry. Just a lot of water
under the bridge.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.709
- Did she OD?
- Yeah, on lead.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.811
Your ex-wife died of a gunshot
to the head.

16:12.988 --> 16:17.322
- She shot herself?
- That's unclear at this point.

16:17.493 --> 16:21.657
But, um, to your knowledge,
did your ex-wife Gina own a gun?

16:21.830 --> 16:23.730
Like this one, perhaps?

16:25.567 --> 16:28.661
Uh, no. Not that I ever knew of.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.835
Sir?

16:35.010 --> 16:38.241
If you're here wondering whether
I shot her, the answer is no.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.473
Like I said, I don't get out much lately.

16:42.718 --> 16:46.484
Gina's boyfriend, Mr. West, told us
that there were some custody issues...

16:46.655 --> 16:48.316
...that you were dealing with.

16:48.490 --> 16:51.323
I just wanted her to get clean,
that's all.

16:51.493 --> 16:54.189
Now, I had the courts
force her into rehab...

16:54.363 --> 16:58.823
...in order to give Cody the best
possible chance at a healthy home.

16:59.001 --> 17:02.767
I mean, I even gave Gina $25,000
when she got out...

17:02.938 --> 17:05.531
...just to get her
back on her feet again.

17:05.708 --> 17:09.576
I'm just...
I'm trying to make the best...

17:09.744 --> 17:13.339
...of a truly terrible situation,
you know?

17:13.515 --> 17:14.880
For Cody.

17:15.784 --> 17:19.117
When did you say you gave
your ex-wife this $25,000?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.279
<i>The money is not in her account.</i>

17:22.590 --> 17:26.686
But, uh, if you look here,
the boyfriend, Wayne West...

17:26.862 --> 17:30.855
It says he deposited $25,000
into his bank account four days ago.

17:31.033 --> 17:34.093
Two days after Gina got out of rehab.

17:34.937 --> 17:38.395
Detective Sanchez, where are we
on Wayne West's alibi?

17:39.875 --> 17:41.069
Julio.

17:42.578 --> 17:46.378
Detective Sanchez, have you been able
to confirm Mr. West's alibi...

17:46.548 --> 17:48.778
...at the time of the shooting?
- Oh, right.

17:48.951 --> 17:53.650
Um, I called the number he gave us.
This guy, Paul Olson.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.620
I had to leave a message.
He hasn't called me back yet.

17:56.792 --> 17:59.317
- Have you tried paying him a visit?
- Not yet, chief.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.963
Well, is that something
that you could possibly do?

18:04.099 --> 18:05.430
Say, now?

18:13.475 --> 18:14.840
Chief. Ahem. Chief.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.444
Uh, clearly, Wayne West
stole money from Gina.

18:17.613 --> 18:20.343
He owned the car she died in.
He reported her dead.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.814
He went and took a shower,
cleaned himself up.

18:22.985 --> 18:26.079
And then he fled the scene.
What are we waiting on Sanchez for?

18:26.255 --> 18:29.486
All right, lieutenant, you want
another crack at Mr. West yourself?

18:33.629 --> 18:36.154
Tell us about the money.

18:36.331 --> 18:37.355
Oh, man.

18:40.769 --> 18:44.330
This looks bad, I know.
But, um, did you talk to my friend?

18:44.506 --> 18:47.475
- Because I was with him...
- Your friend is avoiding us.

18:48.343 --> 18:49.742
What?

18:51.847 --> 18:53.109
Okay, look.

18:54.016 --> 18:55.984
- Gina's ex gave me that money.
- Really?

18:56.151 --> 18:59.882
- Because he told us he gave it to her.
- No.

19:01.456 --> 19:03.048
No way. No.

19:03.258 --> 19:05.818
Okay, okay. Uh, he gave me that money.

19:05.994 --> 19:09.054
He wanted me to convince Gina
to sign away her parental rights.

19:09.264 --> 19:12.529
- That's the truth.
- He also want you to put a bullet in her?

19:12.701 --> 19:14.464
Man, please. He was her ex.

19:14.636 --> 19:16.729
Mr. Tatem was probably dying,
Mr. West.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.237
I don't think sole custody
was an issue for him.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.308
Look, I know, okay? But he's loaded.

19:21.476 --> 19:26.175
So I guess the thing is, when he kicks it,
that money goes into a trust for the girl.

19:26.348 --> 19:27.747
A trust Gina would control...

19:27.916 --> 19:30.976
...unless someone could convince her
to sign away her rights.

19:31.153 --> 19:33.781
Well, did you convince her
like Tatem paid you to?

19:36.892 --> 19:38.757
You know,
it was never the right moment.

19:38.927 --> 19:43.421
You had far more to gain
if Gina got custody of her daughter.

19:43.599 --> 19:49.868
And yet you want us to believe that you
agreed to sell yourself short for $25,000?

19:50.038 --> 19:53.030
Who's to say she wouldn't skip
as soon as things went her way?

19:53.208 --> 19:56.405
Besides, you think I want
that whiny little brat around?

19:56.578 --> 19:58.944
No, man. Just give me the 25 upfront.

19:59.114 --> 20:02.174
At least I know what's in it for me,
you know?

20:05.554 --> 20:07.715
Uh, chief, can I talk to you two
for a second?

20:07.890 --> 20:10.358
Yes, detective.

20:10.525 --> 20:11.890
Just a moment, Mr. West.

20:14.596 --> 20:15.688
I didn't do it.

20:17.733 --> 20:21.931
Darren Tatem just wired another
$25,000 into Wayne's account.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.402
Beginning to look less and less
like a suicide.

20:25.574 --> 20:27.235
And more like a murder for hire.

20:36.919 --> 20:38.113
- Yeah.
- More?

20:38.287 --> 20:40.482
Uh, yeah, a little bit more.

20:41.123 --> 20:42.784
Good?

20:43.225 --> 20:45.022
Chief, I'm sorry.

20:45.193 --> 20:47.457
My mother had to go to work,
my sister's sick.

20:47.629 --> 20:50.359
- He had no place...
- Have you found Mr. West's alibi yet?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.233
Not yet, no. But...

20:56.705 --> 20:59.902
- You are holding up my investigation.
- I went by Olson's apartment.

21:00.075 --> 21:03.738
A neighbor said he skipped to Vegas.
I have police there looking for him.

21:03.946 --> 21:07.006
But I have no other way
to verify West's alibi.

21:07.549 --> 21:08.743
Chief. Good news.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.852
Sanchez found someone else
who can verify Wayne West's alibi.

21:19.061 --> 21:22.428
Detective, a choice needs to be made
regarding your situation.

21:22.597 --> 21:25.088
And Lieutenant Provenza
is going to help you make it.

21:29.004 --> 21:30.562
Lieutenant, with me. With me.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.542
Chief, I'm sorry. He's just new to
this taking-care-of-kids thing.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.184
- I was trying to help.
- Then stop covering for him.

21:43.352 --> 21:46.446
- Tell me about this new alibi.
- Going through Tatem's accounts...

21:46.621 --> 21:49.249
...we found payments he made
to a private investigator.

21:49.424 --> 21:51.756
- Gabriel's bringing the guy in right now.
- Good.

21:51.927 --> 21:55.693
- Here, let me get the door for you.
- Thank you.

21:55.864 --> 21:57.354
<i>West didn't kill anyone.</i>

21:57.532 --> 22:00.592
I was following him the whole night.
Got it all written down.

22:00.769 --> 22:02.100
- May I?
- Yeah.

22:02.270 --> 22:04.067
You were hired by Mr. Tatem, correct?

22:04.239 --> 22:06.537
Yeah, there were some custody issues.

22:06.708 --> 22:09.802
Tatem wanted me to find out
if his ex-wife was still on drugs.

22:10.012 --> 22:13.106
It tore him up thinking
she was gonna raise their little girl.

22:13.281 --> 22:15.374
- I felt for the guy.
- Okay, here we go.

22:15.550 --> 22:19.486
"Thursday night, 6:27 p.m.
West is picked up by a friend.

22:19.654 --> 22:23.090
- Gina remains at the apartment."
- Yeah, that's why I stayed on West.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.726
- Figured I'd see if he was buying for her.
- Was he?

22:25.894 --> 22:28.454
Couldn't prove it.
But he was definitely using though.

22:28.630 --> 22:30.791
He scored meth that night
with his friend.

22:31.466 --> 22:35.368
It says here West got home
at 10:15 p. m?

22:35.570 --> 22:38.164
Right. When he discovered her body.

22:38.340 --> 22:44.108
He freaked and called 911 on his cell,
and I left, got some sleep. Sorry.

22:45.313 --> 22:47.838
How often were you reporting
to Mr. Tatem?

22:48.016 --> 22:49.847
- Every day at some point.
- By phone?

22:50.018 --> 22:52.987
Mostly. He came by the office
a few times...

22:53.155 --> 22:55.988
...when he was up to it.
- So he's still able to get around.

22:56.158 --> 22:59.355
And that night, the night that Gina died.
Did you talk to him then?

22:59.528 --> 23:01.621
I did.
I told him West was getting high.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.163
So Mr. Tatem knew Gina
was by herself.

23:04.332 --> 23:06.698
Investigator said she was dead
by 10 p.m.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.366
But why would he pay me
to prove his ex-wife was using...

23:10.539 --> 23:12.200
...if he was gonna kill her anyway?

23:12.374 --> 23:15.172
I promise that is the first question
I'm gonna ask him.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.911
- We're here to speak with Darren.
- He's busy. Unless you have a warrant...

23:24.119 --> 23:25.814
If you'll excuse us.

23:26.421 --> 23:28.685
Lieutenant Tao, upstairs.
Lieutenant Provenza?

23:28.857 --> 23:31.985
Sir, is Mr. Tatem
in his recording studio?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.320
I'll take that as a yes.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.259
- And his daughter?
- Cody went shopping with my wife.

23:36.431 --> 23:39.867
Look, showing up with all these people
is completely unnecessary.

23:40.035 --> 23:42.094
- Darren will cooperate in any way.
- Good.

23:42.270 --> 23:44.704
- Detective.
- He's very sick. Don't you understand?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.771
Don't...
He hasn't done anything wrong.

23:47.943 --> 23:50.776
Why don't you just tell me
what you want?

23:50.946 --> 23:53.437
- Mr. Tatem.
- My son didn't do anything.

23:53.648 --> 23:55.013
Mr. Tatem.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.376
- Mr. Tatem, open this door.
- Wait. Wait.

23:58.553 --> 23:59.781
- Sir. Sir.
- Darren, please.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.515
- Sir, stay back, okay?
- Mr. Tatem, we need to talk.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.750
- Open this door now.
- Please, let me just...

24:04.926 --> 24:06.951
- Stay back. Stay back!
- This is ridiculous.

24:07.129 --> 24:08.153
- Want it open?
- Yes.

24:09.131 --> 24:11.429
Tatem, we know you hired
a private investigator.

24:11.633 --> 24:14.067
- He told you Gina was by herself.
- Leave him alone.

24:14.236 --> 24:17.069
- Will you shut up? Shut up!
- That woman shot herself!

24:17.239 --> 24:18.900
We know Wayne West didn't kill her.

24:19.074 --> 24:21.508
You just transferred another
$25,000 to frame him.

24:21.676 --> 24:23.234
- Leave my family alone.
- No.

24:23.411 --> 24:26.574
- Please leave them alone?
- That's up to you, Mr. Tatem.

24:26.748 --> 24:28.409
Open this door. We need to talk.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.244
- Dad, I love you.
- Darren?

24:31.019 --> 24:32.577
- Hurry, detective.
- I'm trying.

24:32.754 --> 24:35.120
And I love Mom, too, okay?
And tell Cody...

24:35.290 --> 24:38.123
Tell her that she was everything to me.
Never doubt it.

24:38.293 --> 24:40.557
- Open the door. Get it open now.
- I'm trying.

24:42.063 --> 24:45.965
Darren. Darren, no!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

24:46.168 --> 24:48.295
- Chief, you all right?
- What did you do?

24:48.470 --> 24:49.960
- King 62.
- Oh, Darren.

24:50.172 --> 24:53.141
I got a male, 30s. Need paramedics,
two units and a supervisor.

24:53.308 --> 24:56.106
- Do you copy?
- No. What did you do? What did you do?

24:56.278 --> 24:57.404
Look at this.

24:58.780 --> 25:03.183
"I killed her. For Cody. I'm sorry."

25:11.893 --> 25:15.420
- Now, this was definitely a suicide.
- No argument here.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.327
When people shoot themselves
in the mouth like this...

25:18.500 --> 25:22.436
...they always press their tongue against
the barrel at the moment of truth.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.628
Interesting, no?

25:26.408 --> 25:27.636
How sick was he?

25:27.809 --> 25:30.403
Uh, about as sick as you can be.

25:30.579 --> 25:32.171
Uh, the cancer was everywhere.

25:32.347 --> 25:36.443
- He had a few weeks left, max.
- Would he have known that for sure?

25:37.118 --> 25:39.951
No responsible physician would have
told him anything else.

25:40.655 --> 25:44.819
So why not just turn himself in?

25:45.660 --> 25:48.026
I don't know.
In his condition, judge grants bail.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.994
- He spends whatever time left at home.
- With his daughter.

25:51.166 --> 25:52.633
And his morphine drip. Hmm.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.234
But to each his own.

25:56.504 --> 26:00.531
Let's just go back over everything,
just to be safe.

26:00.742 --> 26:04.178
The timeline, the finances.
Just recheck everyone's story.

26:04.679 --> 26:06.510
Thank you so much, doctor.

26:06.681 --> 26:07.909
Oh, um...

26:09.184 --> 26:11.880
The tox results for Gina Decker.

26:12.053 --> 26:15.819
Even though I'm still pretty certain
it was the bullet that killed her...

26:15.991 --> 26:19.119
...she was pretty jacked up on meth
at the time of death.

26:23.298 --> 26:25.596
So she would've lost custody
regardless.

26:25.767 --> 26:26.961
Wow.

26:27.135 --> 26:30.161
- If Tatem had only known.
- That's what bothers me.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.738
He did know. I mean, he had to.

26:32.907 --> 26:35.239
- His PI told him Wayne was using.
- Wait a minute.

26:35.410 --> 26:37.970
I'm sorry. Are you questioning
the confession now?

26:38.146 --> 26:40.910
You mean the seven words
he typed on his computer?

26:41.082 --> 26:43.915
Just because he didn't say them
doesn't make it less real.

26:44.085 --> 26:50.183
Anyway, uh, speaking of custody issues,
I've been thinking.

26:50.358 --> 26:54.795
If I make chief,
I might move you into my job.

26:57.499 --> 26:58.557
In which case...

26:58.733 --> 27:03.033
...we would need to begin to consider
who might take over your division.

27:04.539 --> 27:06.166
Wow.

27:07.609 --> 27:11.511
Uh, okay, yes,
I'II, um, start thinking about that.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.580
How do I look? Seriously.

27:13.748 --> 27:18.344
Fine. Nice.
Where you going, anyway?

27:18.520 --> 27:24.584
This event-slash-dinner thing
with a bunch of, uh, city council members.

27:24.759 --> 27:28.923
Blah. You don't know how lucky you are
you don't have to do this stuff.

27:29.097 --> 27:30.428
What about Taylor?

27:30.598 --> 27:32.759
- What about him?
- You know, for Major Crimes.

27:34.602 --> 27:37.400
Well, think about it.
He's been very supportive.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.096
So send him a basket of muffins.

27:45.947 --> 27:48.381
Have a nice dinner.

27:49.851 --> 27:52.445
You're talking in the realm
of ifs and maybes.

27:52.620 --> 27:54.281
I'm talking in the realm of facts.

27:54.456 --> 27:57.823
It's not as simple as you're
making it out. It's not that simple.

27:57.992 --> 27:59.459
Lieutenant.

27:59.627 --> 28:01.254
You need to handle this.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.920
- Chief, this isn't about Sanchez.
- Gabriel, come on.

28:05.967 --> 28:07.901
- What's it about?
- Nothing, chief.

28:08.069 --> 28:09.593
Everything's fine. Nothing.

28:13.575 --> 28:16.442
- Tatem did not kill his ex-wife.
- Why do you say that?

28:18.246 --> 28:22.239
We were going back through everything
and took a look at Tatem's computer.

28:22.417 --> 28:25.181
We were looking at the score
that he was finishing up.

28:26.521 --> 28:27.647
Lieutenant, the score.

28:35.697 --> 28:39.133
The program he works on
is automatically set up...

28:39.300 --> 28:41.495
...to save changes every five minutes.

28:44.038 --> 28:47.030
Could you open the list of changes,
please, lieutenant?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.539
Oh, boy, here we go.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.503
Right. Okay.

28:54.549 --> 28:57.017
If you notice the dates and times
of these saves...

28:57.185 --> 28:59.813
...they occurred during the evening
of Gina's murder...

28:59.988 --> 29:02.980
...starting at 6 p.m.
and continuing past 11.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.355
That doesn't mean he was there.
The program saves automatically.

29:06.528 --> 29:07.790
Only if changes are made.

29:07.962 --> 29:11.295
So he had to have been working
on the score during that time...

29:11.466 --> 29:13.900
...or it wouldn't have changed anything?
- Exactly.

29:14.068 --> 29:15.626
Chief. Please.

29:21.376 --> 29:23.469
Chief, we've already solved
this case once.

29:23.645 --> 29:25.579
It's wrapped up with a bow on top.

29:25.747 --> 29:29.581
Now, if you untie that bow,
you know what will happen.

29:48.770 --> 29:51.671
This isn't the kind of decision
we make on our own.

29:55.410 --> 29:58.072
Detective Gabriel,
since this is still a custody case...

29:58.246 --> 30:00.043
...I'd like to see Cody Tatem.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.275
Have her grandparents bring her in,
please. Thank you.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.520
Yes, ma'am.

30:14.395 --> 30:17.523
We'II, uh, head down here.

30:17.699 --> 30:20.793
Sorry for the inconvenience.

30:22.303 --> 30:24.771
- Thank you, commander.
- Oh. No job too small.

30:26.574 --> 30:30.601
Mr. and Mrs. Tatem, thank you so much
for coming down here tonight.

30:30.778 --> 30:31.870
Right this way.

30:40.722 --> 30:44.715
Seems like we're running our own
little daycare here lately.

30:44.893 --> 30:48.795
Um, Detective Sanchez here would be
happy to watch Cody while we talk.

30:48.963 --> 30:50.396
If you don't mind.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.829
- Cody? Okay?
- Okay.

30:53.034 --> 30:54.331
- It's okay.
- Lieutenant.

30:55.069 --> 30:56.229
Thank you.

30:56.404 --> 30:57.735
Come on, sweetheart.

30:57.906 --> 30:59.771
- This...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

30:59.941 --> 31:03.433
You said that you had some questions
about Darren's death.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.512
Yes. I have what I hope will be
comforting news for you both.

31:06.681 --> 31:08.911
That is that we've been able
to establish...

31:09.083 --> 31:12.246
...that your son was not responsible
for the death of Gina Decker.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.444
What?

31:13.621 --> 31:15.646
I fail to see how
that's comforting news.

31:15.823 --> 31:18.849
It was your investigation
that forced Darren to commit suicide.

31:19.060 --> 31:21.551
Our investigation
did not force him to confess.

31:24.165 --> 31:26.861
Which of you was he trying to protect
by killing himself?

31:27.068 --> 31:29.263
- What?
- No one. That's ridiculous.

31:29.437 --> 31:31.132
We're not answering anything else.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.207
You will if you want to retain custody
of your granddaughter.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.640
- You wouldn't dare try to keep her here.
- I've done worse things.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.612
I'm beginning to think
that you have too.

31:44.185 --> 31:45.880
Let's find out.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.858
- You first.
- Albert?

31:54.028 --> 31:58.795
Sir. Sir, I need you to
come with me down the hall, please.

32:09.043 --> 32:12.206
<i>I'd like</i>
<i>you to have a seat right here, please.</i>

32:12.380 --> 32:15.281
<i>It'll just be a few minutes.</i>

32:15.450 --> 32:18.908
<i>All right. Now, Mrs. Tatem,</i>
<i>I've gone around and around on this case...</i>

32:19.087 --> 32:21.578
<i>...and frankly,</i>
<i>I'm tired of being lied to.</i>

32:21.756 --> 32:25.283
<i>So I'm gonna make this simple.</i>
<i>Detective Gabriel has read you your rights.</i>

32:25.460 --> 32:28.554
<i>I'm gonna talk to you,</i>
<i>then I'm gonna talk to your husband.</i>

32:28.730 --> 32:32.291
<i>If I believe the two of you conspired</i>
<i>to kill your ex-daughter-in-law...</i>

32:32.467 --> 32:34.298
- <i>No. That never happened.</i>
- <i>Then Cody...</i>

32:34.469 --> 32:36.300
...who's lost her mother and father...

32:36.471 --> 32:39.804
...will also lose you when
the Department of Children's Services...

32:39.974 --> 32:42.636
...puts her into foster care.
- Oh, God. No, please...

32:42.810 --> 32:45.643
However, if I believe
that one of you acted on your own...

32:45.813 --> 32:48.680
...the remaining grandparent
will be awarded full custody...

32:48.850 --> 32:50.977
...and be able to take Cody
home tonight.

32:57.759 --> 32:58.783
Are we done yet?

32:59.527 --> 33:01.518
<i>Mrs. Tatem?</i>

33:03.097 --> 33:06.191
<i>Darren was our only child.</i>

33:06.367 --> 33:09.632
<i>And when it became clear that he wasn't</i>
<i>going to beat the cancer...</i>

33:10.371 --> 33:12.805
<i>...the only thing we had</i>
<i>to hold onto...</i>

33:13.007 --> 33:16.170
...was that he would live on with us
through Cody.

33:16.978 --> 33:23.975
And Thursday morning when Darren
told us that Gina had tested clean...

33:24.452 --> 33:31.324
...and that after he was gone,
we were going to lose Cody too...

33:33.361 --> 33:37.354
Had you tried to arrange it so you would
retain custody of your granddaughter?

33:37.532 --> 33:40.501
Of course. We hired lawyers.

33:40.668 --> 33:43.398
But in California,
when the mother is deemed fit...

33:45.006 --> 33:47.804
...the grandparents have
no custodial rights.

33:49.677 --> 33:52.145
Let's get to Thursday night, shall we?

33:54.716 --> 33:56.843
My husband...

33:57.018 --> 34:03.514
...he called Gina
and told her he wanted to meet.

34:03.691 --> 34:06.319
And that there would be
a lot of money in it for her...

34:06.494 --> 34:13.024
...if she would just sign away
her parental rights.

34:13.201 --> 34:16.830
But she refused to meet Albert.

34:20.574 --> 34:22.940
So I went instead.

34:24.512 --> 34:26.206
Wait. You did?

34:29.917 --> 34:35.014
I brought our checkbook,
hoping I could pay her enough money...

34:35.188 --> 34:38.625
...to get her to sign the papers.
- And you also brought a gun.

34:41.896 --> 34:43.261
Yes.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.357
I did.

34:46.534 --> 34:49.867
Mrs. Tatem, let me warn you,
if your husband's story does not match...

34:50.036 --> 34:54.235
...I'll think you planned it together.
- My husband didn't do it. Listen. I did it.

34:56.878 --> 34:58.470
<i>I did it.</i>

35:00.248 --> 35:02.239
Tell me how you planned it.

35:02.784 --> 35:06.151
I didn't plan it.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.084
I just knew it had to be done.

35:12.960 --> 35:17.556
Gina was surprised to see me...

35:17.732 --> 35:20.257
...but I told her I just wanted to talk.

35:21.402 --> 35:25.099
She was hungry,
so I offered to buy her dinner.

35:25.807 --> 35:31.837
I was low on gas
and Gina's license had been revoked.

35:32.013 --> 35:34.140
So we got in Wayne's car.

35:34.315 --> 35:40.413
But before we drove away, I asked Gina
where she was comfortable going...

35:40.588 --> 35:42.249
...considering how she was dressed.

35:42.423 --> 35:45.688
And she took that entirely
the wrong way.

35:46.961 --> 35:50.829
She ended up screaming at me.

35:50.998 --> 35:55.765
That's when she said that
after Darren died...

35:55.937 --> 35:58.667
...we would never see Cody again.

36:00.474 --> 36:03.409
<i>There was nothing left to discuss.</i>

36:05.680 --> 36:08.205
I got out of the car.

36:10.017 --> 36:13.680
She was so mad,
she wouldn't even look at me.

36:15.489 --> 36:18.856
I reached into my purse for the gun...

36:21.062 --> 36:23.724
...I leaned into the car...

36:26.500 --> 36:28.627
...and I shot her in the head.

36:32.540 --> 36:33.837
Where did you get the gun?

36:34.742 --> 36:36.972
It was Darren's.

36:37.879 --> 36:39.676
I'd hidden it from him...

36:42.450 --> 36:44.975
...afraid he might do something stupid.

36:47.755 --> 36:49.347
I guess he replaced it.

36:51.359 --> 36:53.827
Did he know you killed Gina?

36:56.697 --> 36:59.689
Not until you showed him
a picture of his gun.

37:01.369 --> 37:02.529
What about your husband?

37:04.238 --> 37:06.069
<i>He doesn't know anything.</i>

37:09.243 --> 37:12.974
I had decided to let Darren go...

37:13.848 --> 37:18.615
...with the knowledge that
Cody would be safe.

37:20.421 --> 37:22.719
But you took away all the time
Darren had left.

37:23.991 --> 37:27.449
With Cody,
with your husband, with you.

37:27.628 --> 37:30.859
Your son killed himself to protect you.

37:32.199 --> 37:33.757
And worst of all, Mrs. Tatem...

37:33.935 --> 37:37.029
...blood work from our morgue shows
that Gina was still using.

37:37.805 --> 37:40.603
So she would have lost custody
anyway.

37:43.077 --> 37:47.741
You only know that
because I put a bullet in her brain.

37:49.817 --> 37:52.411
And what would have happened to Cody
if I hadn't?

37:54.121 --> 37:57.113
We all know. Don't we?

38:00.227 --> 38:01.592
<i>I had to do it.</i>

38:03.664 --> 38:05.564
I had to.

38:10.805 --> 38:15.265
I'm gonna bring your husband in now
so you can tell him yourself what you did.

38:21.649 --> 38:23.549
Good luck to you, Mrs. Tatem.

38:35.763 --> 38:37.424
- Bringing the husband.
- Thank you.

38:38.099 --> 38:40.932
Chief, you know,
we could write this up as manslaughter.

38:41.836 --> 38:44.828
- She brought a gun with her, lieutenant.
- And good intentions.

38:45.606 --> 38:48.040
Is this how you want
custody battles decided?

38:48.209 --> 38:51.178
By knocking off everyone
unqualified to be a parent?

38:51.345 --> 38:53.506
We'd have a world full of orphans.

39:01.722 --> 39:03.986
Write it up as a murder.

39:04.158 --> 39:05.716
We'll let the jury decide.

39:06.460 --> 39:07.791
Yeah, chief.

39:28.682 --> 39:30.673
- You want me to turn this off, chief?
- Uh, no.

39:30.851 --> 39:33.046
- Can I borrow your headphones, please?
- Sure.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.211
<i>Oh, God.</i>

39:38.426 --> 39:41.156
You're sure she's not lying to you?

40:09.924 --> 40:11.653
I am now.

40:57.404 --> 40:58.428
Rough day?

40:58.606 --> 41:00.870
Ah. You could say that.

41:03.677 --> 41:05.338
Thanks.

41:10.684 --> 41:13.175
You decide to turn in your application
for chief?

41:13.854 --> 41:16.721
No. Because the only person
in my division...

41:16.891 --> 41:19.223
...who's begun to share my priorities
is Gabriel.

41:19.393 --> 41:22.521
And he'd never even be considered,
because of his rank.

41:22.696 --> 41:24.027
And maybe his record.

41:25.299 --> 41:28.996
You know, Pope went outside
the department to find you.

41:29.803 --> 41:33.364
You could do the same. Of course,
you'd have to be chief to do it.

41:38.012 --> 41:39.036
I don't know.

41:44.051 --> 41:46.076
We'll see.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.387
Maybe you're right.

41:51.559 --> 41:54.995
Maybe getting a little emotional distance
wouldn't be such a terrible thing.

41:55.162 --> 41:56.959
Hmm.
