00:00.264 --> 00:02.243
Previously on
the <i>"Secret Circle"...</i>

00:02.246 --> 00:03.378
My name's John Blackwell.

00:03.380 --> 00:04.596
I'm your father.

00:04.598 --> 00:05.914
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:05.916 --> 00:07.466
Once you activated
the medallion,

00:07.468 --> 00:08.750
I knew that you were
in trouble.

00:08.752 --> 00:10.869
And you aren't sure if you can
trust me.

00:10.871 --> 00:11.920
I'm sure that I don't.

00:11.922 --> 00:14.640
16 years ago
the truce was a trap.

00:14.642 --> 00:16.909
The circle was split
over who to believe.

00:16.911 --> 00:20.195
I saw your dad at the boatyard
just before the fire started.

00:20.197 --> 00:21.797
My dad wasn't there
that day.

00:21.799 --> 00:23.966
One of the men in
the council, Eben,

00:23.968 --> 00:27.019
he was talking about the ritual
they used to kill your father.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.491
Eben spelled me.

00:32.493 --> 00:34.546
When regular people do
that kind of thing,

00:34.571 --> 00:35.695
they're called witches.

00:35.696 --> 00:38.113
I can assure that
he is no witch.

00:38.115 --> 00:40.032
Then he's working with one
like you work with Jake.

00:40.034 --> 00:42.034
I don't know.
But until I find out,

00:42.036 --> 00:44.086
I'm staying right here
in Chance Harbor.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:55.381 --> 00:57.216
Faye, we need to talk.

00:57.218 --> 00:58.450
Doors are
for knocking.

00:58.452 --> 01:00.052
I'll make you a deal.
I'll start knocking

01:00.054 --> 01:02.087
when you start acting like the
Principal's daughter at school.

01:02.089 --> 01:03.755
But I am the Principal's
daughter, mother.

01:03.757 --> 01:05.257
No need for me
to act.

01:05.259 --> 01:06.725
I mean it, Faye.

01:06.727 --> 01:08.260
I need tonight's casino fundraiser
to go smoothly.

01:08.262 --> 01:09.478
No drama.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.096
You should bring
a date

01:11.098 --> 01:13.115
so you have someone
to fixate on other than me.

01:13.117 --> 01:14.566
I'll be just fine,
thank you.

01:14.568 --> 01:17.402
Obviously Mr. Meade
isn't doing it for you.

01:17.404 --> 01:19.605
Ooh, what about
Cassie's dad?

01:23.643 --> 01:25.410
Did you say
Cassie's dad?

01:25.412 --> 01:28.715
Haven't you heard?
He's back from the dead.

I don't know how
you like your coffee.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.619
I don't know if you
like coffee at all.

01:51.621 --> 01:53.403
It's perfect.
Thanks.

01:53.405 --> 01:57.407
Black. I figured
the darker the better.

01:59.344 --> 02:01.428
I was thinking maybe
I should stay here

02:01.430 --> 02:03.214
till your grandmother
gets back.

02:03.216 --> 02:04.799
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea,

02:04.801 --> 02:07.017
seeing as how you're
a complete stranger

02:07.019 --> 02:09.669
that people seem
to be terrified of.

02:09.672 --> 02:10.687
No offense.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.690
None taken.

02:13.642 --> 02:17.228
I hate that I'm
a stranger to you.

02:17.230 --> 02:18.595
I'm...

02:18.597 --> 02:21.448
I want to change that.

02:21.450 --> 02:23.951
I know you have
questions, Cassie,

02:23.953 --> 02:25.769
and I'd like to
answer them.

02:25.771 --> 02:29.240
Ok.

02:35.597 --> 02:37.731
Did you love my mother?

02:39.551 --> 02:41.936
More than anyone
in the world.

02:41.938 --> 02:47.508
Then why didn't she
talk about you...ever?

02:49.327 --> 02:50.845
'Cause I hurt her.

02:50.847 --> 02:53.792
She probably figured it was
best for you both to forget me,

02:54.851 --> 02:56.183
what I'd become.

02:56.185 --> 02:58.468
What had you become?

02:58.470 --> 03:02.857
Someone that she
was fearful of.

03:02.859 --> 03:05.042
And rightfully so.

03:05.044 --> 03:06.577
Dark magic changed me.

03:06.579 --> 03:08.645
No, that's an excuse.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.815
Ok, I have dark magic up to
my eyeballs thanks to you,

03:11.817 --> 03:13.200
and I haven't changed.
Not yet,

03:13.202 --> 03:14.952
but it's not something you
can control.

03:14.954 --> 03:17.288
Maybe you can't,
but I can.

03:26.598 --> 03:28.716
Stop!

03:28.718 --> 03:31.802
That wasn't a mistake.
I meant to do that.

03:31.804 --> 03:33.470
It doesn't matter.

03:33.472 --> 03:36.924
Dark magic, it's not
a parlor trick.

03:36.926 --> 03:40.277
The more you use it,
the more it takes hold of you.

03:40.279 --> 03:41.445
I use it to help people.

03:41.447 --> 03:42.780
I use it to protect
the circle.

03:42.782 --> 03:44.431
I thought I could do
the same thing.

03:44.433 --> 03:49.904
But the darkness made me vengeful
and destructive.

03:51.623 --> 03:54.942
I lost the very people I was
trying to protect.

03:56.044 --> 03:58.579
Once dark magic
takes a hold of you,

03:58.581 --> 04:01.615
it's impossible
to get free.

04:04.519 --> 04:07.087
You don't know me
very well.

04:25.991 --> 04:28.025
You watch over her,
don't you?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.113
Good.

04:45.193 --> 04:47.077
Where has he been
for the last 16 years?

04:47.079 --> 04:48.212
I don't know exactly.

04:48.214 --> 04:50.014
He just said it would be
safer for me and my mom

04:50.016 --> 04:51.465
if people thought
he was dead.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.417
That sounds like
the excuse of a man

04:53.419 --> 04:55.185
who's hiding a whole
other family somewhere.

04:55.187 --> 04:56.937
Faye.
Oh, God.

04:56.939 --> 04:59.974
Imagine if there was
another Cassie running around.

04:59.976 --> 05:02.059
Then you could
each have one.

05:02.061 --> 05:05.429
If Blackwell's such
a huge force of dark magic,

05:05.431 --> 05:07.715
why didn't he do anything
to stop the witch hunters?

05:07.717 --> 05:09.950
His power was stripped
like all our parents.

05:09.952 --> 05:11.618
None of us could
have stopped Eben.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.054
He magically recovered
after being impaled by a tree.

05:14.056 --> 05:17.124
Seeing as you're the one who's still
making deals with the hunters,

05:17.126 --> 05:19.943
tell us, how did Eben
get that power?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.829
I don't know.
I would have asked,

05:21.831 --> 05:23.914
but he was too busy
trying to kill me.

05:23.916 --> 05:26.616
Will you two just
arm wrestle or something?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.802
I think you're lucky.
How's that?

05:28.804 --> 05:29.858
Because we've all wished

05:29.883 --> 05:31.622
we could have back
the parent we lost.

05:32.008 --> 05:33.585
Yeah, as long as

05:33.610 --> 05:36.042
that parent isn't the devil
on his days off.

05:39.264 --> 05:40.797
I'm leaving.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.280
I've got to scrounge
together a date

05:42.305 --> 05:43.838
for casino night anyway.

05:44.103 --> 05:45.436
I don't want to pull
a Diana.

05:45.438 --> 05:47.604
Nice, Faye.

05:49.441 --> 05:52.076
So who's helping me
set up for tonight?

05:54.662 --> 05:56.163
I'll see you later.

05:56.165 --> 05:58.482
Bye.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.618
With or without power,
your father can help us.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.554
Eben will be back.

06:03.556 --> 06:05.289
And John Blackwell
knows more about the hunters

06:05.291 --> 06:07.291
than any of us.

06:13.214 --> 06:15.665
You know, Jake's
probably right.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.018
I just don't trust my father
enough to ask for help.

06:18.020 --> 06:19.737
I don't blame you.

06:19.739 --> 06:21.438
Cassie!

06:21.440 --> 06:24.775
Hmm.
My break's over.

06:24.777 --> 06:29.029
Hey, are we going
to casino night together?

06:29.031 --> 06:31.448
What, you mean
like a real life,

06:31.450 --> 06:32.983
out-in-public
kind of date?

06:34.035 --> 06:35.486
I do.

06:35.488 --> 06:38.372
Then yes.

06:51.352 --> 06:52.853
Morning.

06:52.855 --> 06:55.389
Morning, baby.

06:56.641 --> 06:59.309
Don't tell me that's
Jasmine tea.

06:59.311 --> 07:02.763
From that weird
hippie store you like.

07:03.848 --> 07:05.149
How you feeling?

07:07.852 --> 07:10.370
Good.

07:10.372 --> 07:12.389
A little weak,
I guess.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.558
I'm sure you do.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.118
You saved my life.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.236
I did what any guy
would do.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.790
Lee, I OD'd. If it weren't
for you, I'd be dead.

07:29.792 --> 07:33.360
You stayed by me,

07:33.362 --> 07:35.579
nursed me back to health.

07:35.581 --> 07:40.367
Now it's my turn
to stay by your side.

07:40.369 --> 07:43.220
I'll never leave you
again.

07:43.222 --> 07:45.772
Eva, I know you don't
like your folks,

07:45.774 --> 07:47.074
but maybe you should
call them.

07:47.076 --> 07:48.425
Never.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.644
They'd want to know
what happened.

07:50.646 --> 07:52.346
They gave up on me.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.348
Everybody did.

07:54.350 --> 07:57.151
You're my family now.

08:09.998 --> 08:11.465
Hey.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.949
The intrepid planning
committee.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.968
Is that all for us?

08:14.970 --> 08:18.172
Yep. Cups, flatware,
swizzle sticks.

08:18.174 --> 08:20.724
Ahh, cocktail napkins.
I'll be right back.

08:20.726 --> 08:23.460
People can just drink
out of regular cups, right?

08:23.462 --> 08:24.811
We don't need
champagne glasses.

08:24.813 --> 08:27.381
Flutes.

08:27.383 --> 08:28.682
Excuse me?

08:28.684 --> 08:29.983
Champagne flutes.

08:29.985 --> 08:32.068
And you absolutely
need them.

08:32.071 --> 08:35.355
They're tapered specifically
to hold in the bubbles.

08:35.357 --> 08:38.075
It would be a shame for all those
grapes to have given their lives

08:38.077 --> 08:42.663
only to be doomed
to a glass of flat bubbly.

08:42.664 --> 08:43.746
Don't you think?

08:43.749 --> 08:45.282
So you're, what, some
kind of connoisseur?

08:45.284 --> 08:46.667
Summer's spent on
a vineyard.

08:46.669 --> 08:48.285
Makes you appreciate
the whole process.

08:48.287 --> 08:50.921
Process is Diana's
middle name.

08:50.923 --> 08:53.207
We should get these
to the school.

08:57.712 --> 08:59.329
You just ran away
from a guy

08:59.331 --> 09:01.515
who looks like something
you win at a raffle.

09:01.517 --> 09:03.183
Like I'm really gonna
date a normal guy.

09:03.185 --> 09:04.434
Why not?

09:04.436 --> 09:06.470
Because I don't want
to spend an entire relationship

09:06.472 --> 09:08.004
counting the minutes
until we have the talk.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.890
Why do you have to go
straight to relationship?

09:09.892 --> 09:12.643
Why not just see where
that sexy smile of his leads?

09:12.645 --> 09:15.845
You don't have to show him
your witchy undergarments

09:15.847 --> 09:17.397
on the first date.

09:17.399 --> 09:19.700
Need some help
carrying that?

09:19.702 --> 09:21.518
We're good.
Thanks.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.003
You having a party?

09:23.005 --> 09:24.571
Fundraiser, actually.

09:24.573 --> 09:25.956
It's open
to the public,

09:25.958 --> 09:28.242
casino themed,
tonight at the school.

09:28.244 --> 09:30.410
Ah, I'm actually
sailing out this afternoon.

09:30.412 --> 09:33.880
Meeting some friends
at Prince William Sound tomorrow.

09:33.882 --> 09:36.250
I'm Grant, by the way.

09:36.252 --> 09:38.819
I'm Melissa,
this is Diana.

09:38.821 --> 09:41.672
You don't meet a lot
of Dianas these days.

09:41.674 --> 09:44.891
No, you don't.
We're rare finds.

09:49.097 --> 09:50.430
Well, have fun.

09:50.432 --> 09:53.567
Remember, always
split eights in Blackjack.

10:38.425 --> 10:39.943
I got your message.
What's up?

10:39.945 --> 10:42.896
I saw my father sneaking around
the abandoned house,

10:42.898 --> 10:44.280
looking for
something.

10:44.282 --> 10:45.698
I mean,
really looking.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.233
Like it was hidden.

10:47.235 --> 10:49.702
I knew I couldn't
trust hm.

10:49.704 --> 10:51.621
Looking where?

10:51.623 --> 10:54.240
In that post
in the big room.

11:01.048 --> 11:02.465
Hello?

11:05.336 --> 11:07.003
Anyone home?

11:11.225 --> 11:12.392
What are you doing here?

11:12.394 --> 11:14.344
Today is your lucky day.

11:14.346 --> 11:17.180
You get to take me
to casino night.

11:22.503 --> 11:25.138
Cute.

11:25.140 --> 11:29.242
Of course, I'd never be
caught dead in a kitten heel.

11:29.244 --> 11:30.927
I'm really more
of a stiletto.

11:30.929 --> 11:32.562
I can explain those.

11:32.564 --> 11:34.364
So can I.

11:34.366 --> 11:35.815
They're Eva's.

11:38.419 --> 11:39.652
Is this it?

11:39.654 --> 11:43.456
Or are you building
a shrine to your ex?

11:43.458 --> 11:46.759
I think that's it.

11:46.761 --> 11:48.594
Good.

11:53.717 --> 11:56.369
You can't live
in the past.

11:56.371 --> 12:00.673
Especially when the present
looks like me.

12:00.675 --> 12:03.009
You're trouble.

12:03.011 --> 12:07.397
You love it.

12:07.399 --> 12:11.234
Um, you were saying
something about casino night.

12:11.236 --> 12:13.236
At the school.

12:13.238 --> 12:17.056
8:00.

12:17.058 --> 12:20.710
I can't tonight,
actually.

12:20.712 --> 12:22.428
Excuse me?

12:22.430 --> 12:25.197
I have plans that
I can't get out of.

12:25.199 --> 12:27.834
Ok.

12:27.836 --> 12:31.471
Well, I hope you and your plans
have a lovely evening.

12:31.473 --> 12:33.556
Faye.

12:41.432 --> 12:43.649
Let's do this fast.

12:43.651 --> 12:45.902
If Jake comes back, you can
just use your dark magic

12:45.904 --> 12:47.770
to vaporize him,
right?

12:48.839 --> 12:49.939
When we first found
the house,

12:49.941 --> 12:51.858
Nick and I searched
every inch of it.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.693
We figured if the area
was so powerful

12:53.695 --> 12:55.111
it had been written about in
Diana's Book of Shadows,

12:55.113 --> 12:57.697
we probably weren't
the first witches in there.

12:57.699 --> 13:01.200
We found this.

13:02.669 --> 13:05.204
Why would my father
be looking for this?

13:05.206 --> 13:07.006
It's a sway.

13:07.008 --> 13:09.675
It's used to take
a witch's power.

13:09.677 --> 13:12.178
When we found out
what it was for, we hid it.

13:12.180 --> 13:14.914
You think my father
was using it on other witches?

13:14.916 --> 13:17.416
We know he stole power from
the Nidaros coven.

13:20.370 --> 13:23.022
I'll find out.
Give it to me.

13:23.024 --> 13:25.608
You really want
to be alone with him

13:25.610 --> 13:27.643
and the one weapon
that can take your power?

13:27.645 --> 13:30.063
I need to find out
why he wanted this.

13:31.282 --> 13:32.482
Adam, come on.

13:32.484 --> 13:34.534
At least I'll be the one
holding the sway.

13:36.653 --> 13:38.270
After Callum's party,

13:38.295 --> 13:40.680
he could barely keep
his hands off me.

13:40.742 --> 13:43.126
And now I'm getting
blown off?

13:43.128 --> 13:44.210
It doesn't make sense.

13:44.212 --> 13:46.496
Are you losing your touch?
Hardly.

13:46.498 --> 13:48.498
Meanwhile, this one's
turning away hotties

13:48.500 --> 13:49.715
like she's allergic
to them.

13:49.717 --> 13:51.117
We're still on this?

13:51.119 --> 13:52.418
He's leaving tonight.

13:52.420 --> 13:53.886
Whatever.
I've got to go.

13:53.888 --> 13:55.721
And he wouldn't be
leaving

13:55.723 --> 13:57.890
if you'd even
flashed him a smile.

14:00.094 --> 14:01.844
And, you, since when does
Faye Chamberlain

14:01.846 --> 14:03.312
take no for an answer?

14:07.651 --> 14:10.203
When did she get
so insightful?

14:10.205 --> 14:11.354
Wasn't it just last
week we saved her

14:11.356 --> 14:12.605
from a voodoo
drug pusher?

14:12.607 --> 14:14.357
Actually,
she saved herself.

14:14.359 --> 14:16.409
Hmm.

14:16.411 --> 14:18.528
But it's the thought
that counts.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.921
Hey.
Got your message.

14:30.174 --> 14:32.592
Whose magic are you
trying to steal?

14:32.594 --> 14:34.794
Mine?
The circle's?

14:34.796 --> 14:36.596
No one's.

14:38.015 --> 14:39.966
You told me
no more secrets,

14:39.968 --> 14:42.435
so what are you doing
sneaking around

14:42.437 --> 14:45.388
looking for a tool
to take a witch's power?

14:45.390 --> 14:48.357
It doesn't take away
a witch's powers.

14:48.359 --> 14:50.793
It temporarily transfers
them to a mortal.

14:50.795 --> 14:53.529
It's how Eben had
enough power to subdue me

14:53.531 --> 14:55.898
and kill all those witches
at the boatyard at the fire.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.618
I found it
when I escaped.

14:58.620 --> 15:02.205
Now, only another witch
could have spelled it for him.

15:02.207 --> 15:06.058
I only want it so I can find out
who betrayed us.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.744
It had to have been someone
on the boat that day.

15:10.130 --> 15:12.865
Someone from
your mother's circle.

15:16.036 --> 15:18.004
You know something.

15:18.006 --> 15:19.639
No.

15:19.641 --> 15:21.474
If you do,
you have to tell me.

15:21.476 --> 15:25.228
Why, so you can just
get revenge, hurt somebody?

15:25.230 --> 15:27.163
No, so that
I can protect you.

15:27.165 --> 15:31.350
Eben has power again,
more than he ever has.

15:31.352 --> 15:33.336
And whoever
betrayed me then

15:33.338 --> 15:34.820
could be working
for him now.

15:34.822 --> 15:37.356
I need the sway
to find him.

15:39.376 --> 15:42.228
You can trust me.

15:42.230 --> 15:43.579
Please.

16:11.829 --> 16:14.873
Ok, Lee, let's see
if these plans of yours

16:14.898 --> 16:16.354
can withstand this.

16:19.871 --> 16:21.922
Can I help you?

16:21.924 --> 16:24.908
Where's Lee?

16:24.910 --> 16:26.376
He just ran out.

16:26.378 --> 16:28.428
But I know his inventory
pretty well.

16:28.430 --> 16:31.915
Are you, like,
an employee?

16:31.917 --> 16:34.367
No.

16:34.369 --> 16:39.139
I'm Eva,
Lee's girlfriend.

16:42.510 --> 16:44.911
Hey.

16:44.913 --> 16:46.146
What's going on?

16:46.148 --> 16:48.315
Lee, you have a customer.

16:48.317 --> 16:49.449
There you are.

16:49.451 --> 16:53.703
Thought maybe
you were hiding.

17:03.414 --> 17:07.334
Was there anything
in particular you were looking for?

17:07.336 --> 17:10.069
Yes.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.259
But I've changed
my mind.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.684
Why do I get
the feeling

17:24.685 --> 17:28.805
this isn't her
first time here?

17:28.807 --> 17:30.857
She and her friends
found my website.

17:30.859 --> 17:33.610
I think she has
a crush on me.

17:33.612 --> 17:36.980
Well, I don't
blame her for that.

17:48.593 --> 17:51.228
15, 30.
$30 worth.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.547
Thank you.
And good luck.

17:59.336 --> 18:01.054
I'd like to buy
some chips.

18:03.107 --> 18:05.909
Ok. That's a lot
of chips.

18:05.911 --> 18:07.561
It's for a good
cause, right?

18:07.563 --> 18:10.881
Fix the gym, buy new books.
That sort of thing.

18:10.883 --> 18:13.116
The only thing I love more
than gyms are books.

18:13.118 --> 18:14.985
Some of my best
friends are books.

18:19.073 --> 18:20.290
What happened
to Prince William Sound?

18:20.292 --> 18:22.125
It'll still be there
tomorrow.

18:28.799 --> 18:31.167
I've been practicing
that trick all day.

18:31.169 --> 18:32.335
I'm pretty cool,
huh?

18:32.337 --> 18:34.654
Like James Bond.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.205
Then my work here
is done.

18:36.207 --> 18:38.875
By the way, your tip about
always splitting eights

18:38.877 --> 18:41.311
doesn't fly when
the dealer's showing a ten.

18:41.313 --> 18:44.047
Touché.

18:47.685 --> 18:49.319
I'm sorry, did he
just roll up

18:49.321 --> 18:50.687
with a handful
of hundreds?

18:52.790 --> 18:54.858
He really likes books.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.159
Uh, romance novels?

19:07.622 --> 19:10.707
Hey.

19:10.709 --> 19:11.708
So, did you talk to him?

19:11.710 --> 19:13.877
Yes.

19:13.879 --> 19:15.679
You were right
about the sway.

19:15.681 --> 19:17.514
It captures
a witch's powers.

19:17.516 --> 19:20.433
But my father didn't
use it on anyone.

19:20.435 --> 19:22.969
The witch hunters
used it against him.

19:22.971 --> 19:24.087
What do you mean?

19:24.089 --> 19:25.689
Well, a witch spelled it
so that Eben

19:25.691 --> 19:28.275
could have the power
he needed to capture my father.

19:28.277 --> 19:30.944
He thinks whoever
betrayed him back then

19:30.946 --> 19:33.196
is working for
the witch hunters now.

19:33.198 --> 19:36.866
That would be someone
from their circle.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.870
Someone on the boat
that day.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.607
You don't mean my dad.

19:44.609 --> 19:46.960
I don't know.

19:46.962 --> 19:49.713
I saw him in
Jake's memory.

19:49.715 --> 19:51.715
He was rushing out
of there so fast,

19:51.717 --> 19:53.116
and Eben was
right behind him.

19:53.118 --> 19:55.602
He acted like he knew something
was gonna happen.

19:55.604 --> 19:57.304
Do you realize what
you're accusing him of?

19:57.306 --> 19:59.172
I'm not accusing him,
but between what I saw

19:59.174 --> 20:01.057
and what my father
is telling me--

20:01.059 --> 20:02.642
You think it's him.

20:02.644 --> 20:05.178
Adam, you are willing
to blame my father

20:05.180 --> 20:07.314
for every bad thing that's
ever happened in this town.

20:07.316 --> 20:08.882
Yeah, including
this argument.

20:08.884 --> 20:10.150
If someone betrayed
my father,

20:10.152 --> 20:11.451
then I want to
find out who it is.

20:11.453 --> 20:13.436
Oh, it sounds like you've
already decided who it is.

20:13.438 --> 20:14.637
Why is it so hard
for you to believe

20:14.639 --> 20:15.972
that my father
is here to help?

20:15.974 --> 20:17.157
Why is it so easy
for you believe

20:17.159 --> 20:18.975
that might must be working
with the witch hunters?

20:18.977 --> 20:20.243
I didn't say that.

20:20.245 --> 20:21.477
I don't know what happened
in the past,

20:21.479 --> 20:23.246
I don't know what
your father is doing now,

20:23.248 --> 20:26.800
but I least thought that you
and I were on the same side.

20:26.802 --> 20:28.034
We are.

20:28.036 --> 20:31.287
No. Not right now
we're not.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.176
With the number of
surprise visitors I get,

20:36.178 --> 20:39.512
I really got to keep
my room a little neater.

20:39.514 --> 20:42.465
When I went into your
memories of the boatyard fire,

20:42.467 --> 20:44.000
I saw Ethan.
Yeah.

20:44.002 --> 20:46.219
Do you remember seeing him
anywhere else that day,

20:46.221 --> 20:47.787
before, after?

20:47.789 --> 20:50.523
No. Why?

20:50.525 --> 20:51.908
What's going on?

20:51.910 --> 20:56.613
My father said someone from our
parents' circle

20:56.615 --> 20:59.482
gave the witch hunters
the power they needed to attack.

20:59.484 --> 21:01.534
Ethan?
There is no way.

21:01.536 --> 21:02.952
I was hoping that
you might have seen something

21:02.954 --> 21:05.538
that would explain
why else he was there.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.823
You just don't
want to believe

21:06.825 --> 21:08.858
that your boyfriend comes
from a long line of traitors.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.326
I shouldn't have
come to you.

21:10.328 --> 21:12.328
Cassie, Eben used magic

21:12.330 --> 21:14.080
to try to kill you,
your father, and me.

21:14.082 --> 21:15.915
If Ethan was a traitor then,
he could be one now.

21:15.917 --> 21:20.487
You protecting Adam could be
putting us all in jeopardy.

21:20.489 --> 21:22.338
I don't know
what really happened.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.258
It's all based on something I may
or may not have seen

21:25.260 --> 21:27.343
from memories you can't
even remember.

21:27.345 --> 21:29.979
I mean, there has to be
another explanation.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.484
Just forget
I said anything.

21:42.359 --> 21:44.577
Hello?

21:44.579 --> 21:47.731
I need to talk to
you about Cassie.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.117
I'm about to head
over to the school.

22:20.119 --> 22:21.335
You want to drive
together?

22:21.337 --> 22:23.754
No, I'm not going.

22:25.006 --> 22:26.790
You ok?

22:26.792 --> 22:30.678
Dad, I need to know
what exactly happened

22:30.680 --> 22:33.631
back then between you
and Blackwell.

22:33.633 --> 22:36.450
My history with Blackwell
is not your concern.

22:36.452 --> 22:39.720
Yeah, it is. Because whatever
happened back then,

22:39.722 --> 22:42.223
it's affecting
me and Cassie.

22:42.225 --> 22:44.191
Don't let the past spoil
what you two have.

22:44.193 --> 22:46.911
I think it's way
too late for that.

22:46.913 --> 22:48.696
No, it's not.

22:48.698 --> 22:50.681
Not for you.

22:50.683 --> 22:52.449
Cassie's worth
fighting for.

22:52.451 --> 22:55.119
"Fight" being
the key word.

23:03.061 --> 23:05.462
I hope to see you
there later.

23:25.984 --> 23:27.735
This sucks.
I'm gonna go.

23:27.737 --> 23:30.304
I'm sorry.
Lee's an idiot.

23:30.306 --> 23:31.889
If he could see you
in that dress...

23:31.891 --> 23:33.991
Well, he did, so.

23:33.993 --> 23:35.309
Then he's an even
bigger idiot

23:35.311 --> 23:36.577
than I thought he was
two seconds ago,

23:36.579 --> 23:38.028
and that was pretty big.

23:38.030 --> 23:42.750
Or maybe he deserves
another chance.

23:47.923 --> 23:50.124
I'm just saying.

23:51.927 --> 23:53.210
Please let me
explain.

23:53.212 --> 23:55.012
No, let me explain.

23:55.014 --> 23:57.798
When you refer to someone
as your "ex-girlfriend,"

23:57.800 --> 23:59.499
that usually means
it's over between you.

23:59.501 --> 24:00.634
I know.

24:00.636 --> 24:02.269
You told me the devil's crack
destroyed her.

24:02.271 --> 24:03.721
It did. But then
she got better

24:03.723 --> 24:04.722
and came back here.

24:04.724 --> 24:05.723
I noticed.

24:05.725 --> 24:08.776
And in between,
you and me happened.

24:08.778 --> 24:10.477
And I left.
The end.

24:10.479 --> 24:12.029
Look, Faye,
it's complicated.

24:12.031 --> 24:14.114
She's been in a bad situation.
I have to be careful.

24:14.116 --> 24:17.568
I think you're confusing me
with one of those sad girls

24:17.570 --> 24:20.204
who will wait
for a guy to choose.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.671
That's more like it.

25:17.679 --> 25:19.713
Welcome home, John.

25:19.715 --> 25:20.964
Dawn.

25:20.966 --> 25:24.051
I figured you'd come
looking for me sooner or later.

25:24.053 --> 25:25.903
I'm not here for you.

25:27.306 --> 25:28.639
That might be
more convincing

25:28.641 --> 25:30.524
if you didn't have me pinned up
against this locker.

25:34.929 --> 25:38.098
You look pretty good
for a dead man.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.401
You didn't seem
surprised.

25:40.403 --> 25:42.386
I never believed it.

25:42.388 --> 25:44.655
Your funeral
was lovely, though.

25:44.657 --> 25:45.906
I wore red.

25:45.908 --> 25:48.342
Same old Dawn.

25:48.344 --> 25:50.894
Except without
my power.

25:50.896 --> 25:52.496
But with you
finally home,

25:52.498 --> 25:54.665
I know we can find
a way to get it back.

25:54.667 --> 25:59.420
I know you remember what
a powerful team we made.

26:00.955 --> 26:03.123
Things have changed.

26:03.125 --> 26:05.843
I've changed.

26:07.628 --> 26:08.762
Sure you have.

26:08.764 --> 26:11.031
I need to find Ethan.

26:11.033 --> 26:13.300
Ethan? What do you
want with him?

26:13.302 --> 26:14.318
Oh!

26:14.320 --> 26:16.904
Have you seen Ethan?

26:16.906 --> 26:18.989
No.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.940
You came.

26:36.942 --> 26:38.542
Yeah.

26:38.544 --> 26:41.879
I'm sorry
about earlier.

26:41.881 --> 26:43.931
I didn't mean...

26:43.933 --> 26:45.849
No, neither did I.

26:47.835 --> 26:50.304
Your dad is a great guy.

26:50.306 --> 26:52.672
And he has been trying
to hard lately.

26:52.674 --> 26:53.941
Yours has too.

26:53.943 --> 26:57.444
Maybe he does have
an explanation for everything

26:57.446 --> 26:59.646
we've heard
about him.

26:59.648 --> 27:02.065
You should at least
hear him out.

27:05.086 --> 27:06.954
Thank you.

27:09.124 --> 27:11.241
Oh.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.328
I'll put this down.

27:14.330 --> 27:15.879
I'll be here.

27:17.031 --> 27:19.383
Cassie, hi.

27:19.385 --> 27:21.502
Hi.
I just saw your father.

27:21.504 --> 27:23.537
It must be so wonderful
for you to have him home.

27:23.539 --> 27:24.972
He's here?

27:24.974 --> 27:27.591
Yeah. He was looking
for Adam's father.

27:27.593 --> 27:29.676
You wouldn't happen
to know why, would you?

27:29.678 --> 27:32.729
Oh. Uh, no.
Sorry.

27:33.648 --> 27:35.649
Excuse me.

27:56.671 --> 27:57.904
Blackjack.

27:57.906 --> 27:59.122
Yes!

27:59.124 --> 28:01.508
7 in a row?
That's impossible.

28:01.510 --> 28:02.909
Keep your visor on.

28:02.911 --> 28:04.911
Some of us are just
born winners.

28:04.913 --> 28:07.464
Ok, Faye, I think that's enough
good luck for one night.

28:07.466 --> 28:08.966
I'm gonna go get a drink.

28:10.084 --> 28:12.019
I agree.
No.

28:12.021 --> 28:13.086
Yeah.
Come on.

28:13.088 --> 28:14.771
I want to keep playing.
I know you do.

28:17.925 --> 28:20.310
Oh.

28:20.312 --> 28:21.812
Eva.

28:21.814 --> 28:22.779
What are you doing here?

28:22.781 --> 28:24.531
Stalking you,
obviously.

28:24.533 --> 28:25.866
You lied to me.

28:25.868 --> 28:30.103
Maybe you two should
have the talk.

28:36.411 --> 28:38.612
I didn't know
how to tell you.

28:40.381 --> 28:43.500
I get it.
You were lonely.

28:43.502 --> 28:46.587
You didn't know
if I'd come back.

28:46.589 --> 28:47.921
But I did.

28:47.923 --> 28:50.140
And I'm here now.

28:50.142 --> 28:51.975
It's not that simple.

28:51.977 --> 28:53.594
Of course it is.

28:53.596 --> 28:57.180
She's a coping mechanism.

28:57.182 --> 28:59.299
You're better than this.

28:59.301 --> 29:01.134
It's why I love you.

29:40.316 --> 29:44.352
At least buy some chips
so it isn't so obvious.

29:44.354 --> 29:45.570
What's that?

29:45.572 --> 29:47.455
Your Cassie obsession.

29:47.457 --> 29:49.858
I'm not gonna tell you
to move on with your life

29:49.860 --> 29:51.609
like people love
saying to me,

29:51.611 --> 29:54.029
but just so you know,

29:54.031 --> 29:56.448
she's really into him.

29:57.649 --> 29:59.784
Yeah. We'll see.

29:59.786 --> 30:03.455
Well, I did my part.

30:07.843 --> 30:09.711
Hey.

30:12.682 --> 30:14.432
I have 100 tickets,

30:14.434 --> 30:16.184
no small thanks
to you.

30:16.186 --> 30:20.972
How many do I need
for that stuffed monkey?

30:20.974 --> 30:22.107
50.

30:22.109 --> 30:25.193
50 tickets?

30:25.195 --> 30:26.845
I'll take two.

30:30.950 --> 30:33.151
Enjoy.

30:34.537 --> 30:38.156
Matching stuffed monkeys
is always the sign of a good night.

30:39.709 --> 30:41.526
It's an old
Australian saying.

30:41.528 --> 30:42.794
Really?

30:42.796 --> 30:45.163
Hmm.

30:45.165 --> 30:47.248
Uhh.

31:03.066 --> 31:05.883
Aah! Aah!

31:11.490 --> 31:13.074
Oh, my God.

31:13.076 --> 31:14.659
Uhh!

31:18.497 --> 31:19.564
Cassie.

31:19.566 --> 31:20.865
Cassie, don't!

31:59.405 --> 32:01.272
Cassie!

32:01.274 --> 32:02.607
No!

32:02.609 --> 32:04.876
Put it down, please.

32:04.878 --> 32:06.211
He tried to kill you.

32:06.213 --> 32:08.246
Just let him go.

32:12.418 --> 32:13.885
Cassie.

32:30.808 --> 32:32.673
If Adam's dad wasn't
the traitor,

32:32.675 --> 32:35.509
then why did
he attack you?

32:35.511 --> 32:38.896
'Cause he blames me
for what happened that day.

32:38.898 --> 32:41.181
Blames me for stealing
your mother.

32:41.183 --> 32:42.649
He'll be ok, though.

32:42.651 --> 32:44.935
I think you should stay
away from him for now.

32:46.771 --> 32:49.907
You were right
about my dark magic.

32:52.861 --> 32:57.915
It was pushing me to places
that I didn't want to go.

32:57.917 --> 33:00.096
If you continue to use,
those will be the places

33:00.121 --> 33:01.521
you want to go.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.287
It's a slippery slope.

33:03.289 --> 33:05.472
So I have to stop
using all magic?

33:05.474 --> 33:06.790
Yes.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.312
Regular magic is about connecting
to the energy around you.

33:12.314 --> 33:15.299
Dark magic is about
access the energy created

33:15.324 --> 33:17.252
by your own hate and anger.

33:17.253 --> 33:20.003
Now, there might come a day
when you can separate the two,

33:20.005 --> 33:21.071
but not now.

33:21.073 --> 33:23.140
What if I'm desperate?

33:23.142 --> 33:25.509
If my life is in danger,
or yours?

33:25.511 --> 33:27.144
Whatever you're
trying to prevent,

33:27.146 --> 33:29.279
the outcome is going to be
much worse.

33:29.281 --> 33:32.232
In trying to protect me
tonight,

33:32.234 --> 33:34.952
you almost lost yourself
forever.

33:36.187 --> 33:38.572
You have a choice, Cassie.

33:48.049 --> 33:50.384
I was just gonna
come back up from Brazil,

33:50.386 --> 33:51.952
and then I figured
I'd already gone that far,

33:51.954 --> 33:53.504
I might as well
do Argentina.

33:53.506 --> 33:54.888
And once I'd gone
to the tip,

33:54.890 --> 33:58.008
I thought it would be rude
not to visit America.

33:58.010 --> 33:59.626
Anyway, that's
the long answer

33:59.628 --> 34:01.962
to your question
about how I got here.

34:01.964 --> 34:03.730
What's the short answer?

34:03.732 --> 34:07.568
Short answer is
I don't know.

34:07.570 --> 34:10.821
Fate?

34:10.822 --> 34:12.940
This is me.

34:12.942 --> 34:15.308
So you're leaving
tomorrow?

34:15.310 --> 34:18.027
At the crack of dawn.

34:18.030 --> 34:20.164
But I was thinking
I'd come back.

34:20.166 --> 34:21.982
Really?

34:21.984 --> 34:25.150
I mean, this place isn't
exactly Buenos Aires.

34:25.152 --> 34:26.335
Maybe not.

34:26.338 --> 34:28.154
But there is a lot more
to Chance Harbor

34:28.156 --> 34:30.306
than the guidebooks
suggest.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.967
Well, then you
should come back.

34:40.969 --> 34:43.020
Well, then I will.

34:49.643 --> 34:51.344
Thank you
for my monkey.

35:06.494 --> 35:09.079
Eva.

35:10.798 --> 35:12.883
Are you ok?

35:12.885 --> 35:16.870
Why bring me back?

35:16.872 --> 35:19.172
If she's the one
you want,

35:19.174 --> 35:21.058
why bother?

35:21.060 --> 35:23.410
I didn't plan
for any of this.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.461
Believe me when
I tell you--

35:24.463 --> 35:27.848
You should have just
left me there to rot.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.366
Don't say that.

35:29.368 --> 35:32.218
We belong together.

35:32.220 --> 35:35.656
How could you let
her come between us?

35:35.658 --> 35:37.057
This isn't her fault.

35:37.059 --> 35:39.726
It just happened.

35:39.728 --> 35:42.913
I came back from
the dead for you.

35:42.915 --> 35:45.415
You can't
just dump me

35:45.417 --> 35:47.417
for some little slut

35:47.419 --> 35:50.337
who doesn't know
the first thing about love.

35:50.339 --> 35:52.339
It's late. Let's just talk
tomorrow, ok?

35:52.341 --> 35:56.093
I'm not done talking
to you.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.747
You have power?

36:00.749 --> 36:02.633
Yeah.

36:02.635 --> 36:05.602
It was a fun little
surprise for me too.

36:07.522 --> 36:08.939
I'm sorry.

36:11.025 --> 36:17.147
And I will try to help undo
whatever's happened to you.

36:17.149 --> 36:24.121
But you and I are done.

36:24.123 --> 36:29.226
You used to say we'd grow old
together, Lee.

36:29.228 --> 36:32.796
That's how it
has to be.

37:13.371 --> 37:15.822
How could you do it?

37:15.824 --> 37:17.708
How could you give
Eben the power

37:17.710 --> 37:19.459
to destroy
your own circle?

37:19.461 --> 37:21.695
He was only
supposed to take you.

37:21.697 --> 37:24.264
And you trusted him?

37:24.266 --> 37:26.950
Brilliant.

37:26.952 --> 37:28.885
I can't change the past.

37:30.438 --> 37:33.857
No, but at least you have the
decency to be haunted by it.

37:33.859 --> 37:36.843
And I can understand
you wanting to kill me,

37:36.845 --> 37:40.480
keep your son from
knowing the truth about you.

37:40.482 --> 37:43.283
Are you going to
tell them it was me?

37:43.285 --> 37:47.204
No, those kids have
been hurt enough by our mistakes.

37:47.206 --> 37:50.824
And even though
you betrayed us 16 years ago,

37:50.826 --> 37:53.193
I know you're not working
with the witch hunters now.

37:53.195 --> 37:55.545
You have no power
to give them.

37:56.998 --> 37:59.900
And, Ethan,
since I'm keeping your secret,

37:59.902 --> 38:03.720
you will not tell anyone,
not the elders,

38:03.722 --> 38:05.756
not anyone else
about Cassie

38:05.758 --> 38:08.291
and about what you
saw her do tonight.

38:08.293 --> 38:10.227
I won't.

38:10.229 --> 38:12.929
You must have known
getting in bed

38:12.931 --> 38:14.714
with the witch hunters
was dangerous.

38:14.716 --> 38:17.901
Were you really willing
to risk all those lives

38:17.903 --> 38:20.187
out of sheer hatred
for me?

38:20.189 --> 38:23.573
No, but Amelia was.

38:23.575 --> 38:25.859
Amelia?

38:25.861 --> 38:28.361
She wanted you dead.

38:28.363 --> 38:32.149
She wanted you dead
and for us to be together.

38:32.151 --> 38:34.284
And you may have succeeded
in keeping us apart,

38:34.286 --> 38:38.955
but my son and your daughter
are written in the stars,

38:38.957 --> 38:41.641
just like
Amelia and I were.

38:45.930 --> 38:47.931
Amelia never
told you, did she?

38:47.933 --> 38:49.566
Told me what?

38:49.568 --> 38:53.270
For the Blakes
and the Conants,

38:53.272 --> 38:56.589
"written in the stars"
isn't just destiny,

38:56.591 --> 38:59.943
it's a curse.

39:04.532 --> 39:07.818
I waited for you
at the casino.

39:07.820 --> 39:10.436
I'm sorry.

39:10.438 --> 39:12.939
I don't know what happened.

39:13.958 --> 39:15.709
Is everything ok?

39:21.299 --> 39:22.816
Your father...

39:22.818 --> 39:24.634
What about him?

39:24.636 --> 39:26.686
He and my father
were fighting.

39:26.688 --> 39:27.838
What?

39:27.840 --> 39:28.972
And then I got
into the middle of it,

39:28.974 --> 39:30.390
and I lost control.

39:30.392 --> 39:33.626
Like, I completely
lost control.

39:33.628 --> 39:36.730
And I didn't want
to hurt anybody, I swear.

39:36.732 --> 39:38.565
I just got so angry.

39:38.567 --> 39:40.367
But you're ok?

39:40.369 --> 39:41.651
Are they?
Yeah.

39:43.805 --> 39:45.438
Well, then to hell
with them.

39:45.440 --> 39:49.359
Your dad and my dad.
I'm serious.

39:49.361 --> 39:52.946
I am sick of
all the lies.

39:52.948 --> 39:54.431
I just don't care
anymore.

39:54.433 --> 39:58.034
Not when their
secrets...

39:58.036 --> 40:00.871
start getting in
the way of you and me.

40:02.173 --> 40:03.507
Yeah.

40:03.509 --> 40:08.028
What if we can't get out
from underneath their past?

40:08.030 --> 40:11.014
What if we're stuck
just repeating their mistakes?

40:11.016 --> 40:12.966
I don't believe that.

40:14.051 --> 40:16.436
Our fate is our own.

40:17.722 --> 40:20.123
To screw up
however we want.

40:23.645 --> 40:26.980
Don't, don't, don't.

40:26.982 --> 40:29.499
I don't want to hurt you.

40:29.501 --> 40:33.203
I'm not afraid
of you.

40:39.410 --> 40:42.045
I love you.
