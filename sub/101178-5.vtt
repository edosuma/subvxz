00:07.920 --> 00:09.760
I just wish I could
talk to Rita.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.120
In exchange for your evidence
against the Attorney General,

00:12.200 --> 00:14.920
DPP will investigate your
former undercover handlers.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.120
They've already been suspended,
pending the enquiry.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.160
The AG has people out
there after me,

00:19.240 --> 00:20.960
and now I've gotta worry
about Jones and Morelli?

and they were trying to
stick a shiv in her.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.960
Fucking liar!

00:34.600 --> 00:36.160
Novak's in the slot.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.320
We can't keep her there forever.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.680
We need some fucking help here!

00:40.800 --> 00:42.600
Kelly, I want you
to take Marie Winter

00:42.680 --> 00:45.280
and the other ex-protection
prisoners under your wing.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.800
What do I get out of this?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.560
I'm willing to let
Keane resume her HRT.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.280
Joan, do you
recognise these people?

00:52.360 --> 00:56.000
No. And I told you, please
don't call me Joan.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.640

I'm not touching you. Go.

Look at her.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.240
Queen of the Critters.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.080
Can't get proper mates so she
makes friends with the paedos.

Hey, Smiles!

Smiles!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.760
Any idea when Allie's
gonna get out of the slot?

02:18.840 --> 02:20.040
-No.
-[Ruby] Miss Miles?

02:20.120 --> 02:21.320
I need to see the Governor.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.920
-What for?
-I need to talk to Rita.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.240
Never gonna happen.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.880
Hey, what's happening?

02:26.960 --> 02:28.680
I just spoke to my Dad.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.440
He's getting worse and worse.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.720
Shit.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.800
I gotta talk to Rita.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.680
Hey, can you talk to the cops?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.080
Tell them what's going on?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.120
And make 'em tell you
where Rita is.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.080
The authorities
couldn't care less.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.880
Hey, could you hack into
the government system?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.240
You reckon you could
find my sister?

02:55.320 --> 02:57.680
Maybe, but I need
internet access.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.360
What if I find a phone?

03:00.440 --> 03:01.800
No, phone's no good.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.160
I need a computer
with unrestricted access.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.440
[Will]
Medical report says:

03:11.520 --> 03:15.600
'Patient is quiet, confused,
with total memory loss.'

03:16.240 --> 03:17.960
Fuck's sake!

03:18.040 --> 03:19.880
-This printing
company's useless.
-What happened?

03:19.960 --> 03:21.360
Oh, I'd said to them,
I had said you know,

03:21.440 --> 03:22.680
'include all the appendices',

03:22.760 --> 03:24.640
and the idiots have gone
and left one out.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.160
-Ann, it will be okay.
-No, it won't be okay.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.120
If I don't impress the
Minister, then we're all fucked.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.120
Okay, I will sort it out.
I will...

03:31.200 --> 03:34.520
...get some of the women
to copy the page, insert
it into the reports.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.560
Would that work?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.680
Yes. Yes, that would help me.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.000
-You don't need to worry.
-Okay.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.600
Now the Minister's also been on
the phone about Joan Ferguson's
transfer papers.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.320
Yeah. I'm sending
her interstate

03:45.400 --> 03:46.640
as soon as she's
released from the hospital.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.000
She's an A-class prisoner.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.000
She should be coming back here.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.280
She can't.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.320
-Out of the question.
-Why?

03:52.400 --> 03:55.240
If she came back here,
she'd completely destabilize
the prison.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.080
The last time she was here,
the women tried to hang her.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.920
Okay, I'll talk to the
Minister when I see him.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.760
Is the auditorium ready?

04:04.840 --> 04:06.600
Yeah, the AV guys
have finished setting up.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.480
Okay. Better make sure they
haven't stuffed it up.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.720
Hey, Ann.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.400
Ann.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.360
Winter's been in a medical
holding cell for a week and
Novak's in the slot.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.760
We can't keep them
in there forever.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.520
What do you suggest?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.880
Well, I think we should transfer
Winter to another prison.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.240
-Wasn't she the victim?
-Yes,

04:25.320 --> 04:28.400
but Novak is top dog
and she's a much better
influence on the women.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.680
Well, they're both
money in the bank.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.040
Why not move Winter to H6?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.680
She'll be safe with Kelly.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.320
The last thing we need is
two troublemakers teaming up.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.640
No, the last thing we need
is another dead prisoner.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
-So why are we
being moved again?
-New policy.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.720
All the rotten eggs
go in the same bin.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.360
Well can't you
put me somewhere else?

04:47.440 --> 04:49.000
Put me in fuckin'
J Block, please.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.080
You don't get to choose.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.720
I want the one with the view.
[whistles]

04:55.040 --> 04:56.400
Nice shiner. That's kinda hot.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.640
Yeah I told you,
I don't have the money.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.480
So how're we gonna fix this?

05:01.400 --> 05:02.600
Arm wrestle?

05:07.520 --> 05:10.080
You're a cheeky bitch.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.360
You know lucky for you, I've
already decided not to shiv ya'.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.480
Sit down.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.600
Look, it turns out
you're pretty unpopular.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.480
You could come in handy.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.360
See, I reckon that
the women hate you

05:35.440 --> 05:39.920
'cause they're just a
little bit scared of ya'. Hmm?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.560
Fear's a pretty valuable
commodity in this place
and I'm buying.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.960
So what, you in, or what?

05:48.320 --> 05:50.520
I don't really have
a choice, do I?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.840
No.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.880
-Welcome home.
-[horn sounds]

06:07.440 --> 06:10.000
You know you could make
cheese toasties with this.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.720
[Ruby]
Ew! That'd be soggy as!

06:11.800 --> 06:13.320
No, come on.
Don't shit on my idea.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.280
I reckon you could
make loads at once.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.520
Or one giant toastie.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.160
Yeah.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.960
-See, now you're thinkin'.

-Yeah.

he's dodged all the traps.

Good morning, everyone!

06:33.080 --> 06:35.040

06:35.120 --> 06:38.800
Okay. Ruby, Judy, Boomer,
I've got a job for you.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.440
The GM is holding a
presentation in the auditorium.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.120
We need help with some
photocopying.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.800
Oh, yeah, we're
already doing a job.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.200
And I need you to do
something else for half an hour.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.960
No worries, we can do that.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.320
Okay, good.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.440
Yeah, three of you will do.
Let's go.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.600
Come on.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.880
-Hey, why are you
such an eager beaver?
-You wanna find Rita?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.240
Where there's a presentation,
I'll bet there's a wireless
network.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.640
That's just part of
the deal with Reynolds.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.120
So, did you get your HRT shot?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.960
-Yes, I did.
-Yes!

07:28.040 --> 07:31.920
-I told you she
would come through!
-I know!

that fuckin' needle hurts,
but, oh my God.

Still, I cannot wait to
feel like myself again.

onto Trav, we'll be back
on the money trail.

-No, shut up!

out if they see that.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.120
No, nah. They're gonna

You put Reb in hospital

So I'm thinkin' you owe us.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.640
Okay, fine.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.640
I'll give you
your money back, no worries.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.240
No, we don't want your money.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.320
-Where?
-What?

11:19.400 --> 11:21.080
I'll get those
little suckers up!

11:22.960 --> 11:26.320
[ruckus continues]

11:34.160 --> 11:38.480
[Lou tapping, humming]

11:42.600 --> 11:44.280
I reckon your
five minutes is up.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.400
Oh!

11:46.480 --> 11:48.560
Turns out your brother
doesn't love you after all.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.800
What are you gonna do?

11:52.960 --> 11:54.360
There he is.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.440
Hey, Yousef, you all paid up?

12:02.320 --> 12:04.360
Good boy.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.440
Now I will be checking
that account so don't
you be bullshitting.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.840
Oh and if you go to the cops,
I will post you your
sister's fingers.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.280
Okay.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.560
All right. Buh-bye.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.600
Okay, now I'm gonna
hold onto this.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.920
What's your passcode?

12:19.640 --> 12:21.320
9-4-2-2.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.480
...two-two.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.480
Pleasure doing business,
honey.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.600
[Ruby] Oh, there it is!

12:33.680 --> 12:35.440
-Trap it.
-No, I'm not touching it.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.640
-For God's sake!
-No, I think I see
it over there.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.440
Okay, everyone over there
and get down low.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.240
Tell me if you see it.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.120
There's one mouse and
there's how many of us?

12:43.200 --> 12:46.400
-Here, mousey!
-Surely someone could find it.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.680
Minister's here any minute.
We're gonna have to forget
about it.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.200
No, you can't.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.880
It's dangerous.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.320
It's okay, it's just
gone out the door.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.480
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I just saw it.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.440
Sierra 1, this is Sierra 6.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.320
There's a mouse in the
corridor outside the auditorium.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.720
Can you check it out?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.520
[man on radio]
<i>Copy that, Sierra 6.</i>

13:04.600 --> 13:06.000
And tell the Governor we
need the pest controller back.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.360
Those baits are shit.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.120
-You all done?
-You bet.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.920
All right.
Wait outside in the corridor.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.160
Someone'll take you back
to your units. Hurry up.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.160
Hurry up!

13:17.360 --> 13:18.560
Your sister's address.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.720
Thank you.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.880
I owe you big time.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.880
Oh hey, Mr. Woods.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.760
-You looking for the mouse?
-Yes, Jenkins.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.120
He went that way.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.680
[all giggling]

13:33.920 --> 13:36.480
[Ann]<i> I'd like to thank the</i>
<i>whole team here at Wentworth</i>

13:36.560 --> 13:39.000
for coming with me
on this journey,

13:39.080 --> 13:43.280
and the Corrections Minister for
his support and encouragement.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.520
[applause]

13:48.360 --> 13:54.240
My primary goals have been
to reduce running costs
and generate profit,

13:54.320 --> 13:59.120
while also giving our women
a sense of involvement and
achievement.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.640
The women have embraced--

14:00.720 --> 14:02.440
[snickering]

14:16.640 --> 14:19.480
-[Ann]
How the fuck did this happen?
-[Will] We're looking into it.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.480
[Jake] I've sent the Minister
to the Governor's office.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.520
He's not happy.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.200
Oh really, Mr. Stewart?

14:24.280 --> 14:27.000
Maybe it was the massive
arse he was forced to stare at.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.640
Do you think this is funny?

14:29.720 --> 14:31.640
No. Not at all.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.160
One of your inmates just made
a mockery of all our hard work.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.440
I will get to the bottom of it.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.720
I mean, I'm onto it.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.320
Just find the culprit
and slot them.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.640
You've got nothing to say?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.240
Right.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.880
We'll be suspending phone
privileges until someone
owns up.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.360
-What?
-Yeah.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.440
That's just for starters.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.920
We'll also be reconsidering
any upcoming day release.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.120
No, you can't cancel that.
I had nothing to do with it.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.680
And it's tomorrow.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.120
Yep.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.840
Better hope someone
comes forward, then.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.880
What the fuck!

15:10.960 --> 15:13.520
What was the point in getting
the address if they pull my
day release?

15:13.600 --> 15:14.840
She's bluffing.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.040
We keep quiet, it'll blow over.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.120
-No, don't blame me.
-It was meant to be a joke.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.720
I'm the one who's
gonna cop the shit for it!

15:21.800 --> 15:23.680
Well you're the one
who printed it off--

15:23.760 --> 15:25.920
You know my dad's gonna die
and my sister doesn't know.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.440
You dumbasses!

15:42.040 --> 15:43.800
I know it's been a tough day.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.560
I just want to say thank you,
for everything you're doing.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.920
We all feel so much safer
since you started.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.680
I appreciate that.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.600
Actually, have you got a minute?

15:56.680 --> 15:58.920
There's something else
I'd like to run by you.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.440
So once you find out, you leave
a note for Ms. Miles to collect
and she'll notify me.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.160
And, um... we need a mix-up
where we do that.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.760
And I've gotta be
somewhere where people talk.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.680
Mopping corridors
isn't going to cut it.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.080
Fine, what do you suggest?

16:20.160 --> 16:21.880
Laundry.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.560
We can do the dead drop
in the office.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.400
Okay.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.000
Leave it with me.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.240
I need that name.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.240
Any chance of a peppermint?

16:42.320 --> 16:44.440
Yeah, I reckon you should
make it yourself.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.240
Hey...

16:51.800 --> 16:55.000
I'd really like it if
we could be friends again.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.000
We were never friends, Marie.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.640
You were scamming me
to kill Ruby, that's all.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.080
I made a mistake, all right?

17:04.160 --> 17:05.600
I wasn't thinking straight.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.160
But I am now.

17:09.800 --> 17:13.040
Well, I got Lou,
so I don't need friends.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.360
Hey, we got a job to do.

17:18.360 --> 17:19.560
Up you get, Critter.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.000
You too, madam.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.320
-Boo!
-Fuck me.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.920
-Sorry! Sorry!
-Fuck me, fuck!
What are you doing?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.280
-Sorry! So sorry, hey hey hey...
-Just leave me alone, alright?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.880
I just-- hey no hey.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.320
I just wanted to hear the
story about that giant arse
that's been floating around.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.400
I mean, it's pretty
fuckin' funny.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.960
Go on, Booms.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.560
I mean, you know...

17:57.640 --> 18:00.320
that's got you
written all over it.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.120
Did you liked that, did you?

18:05.200 --> 18:08.720
I mean it's, you know, it's
an oldie but it's a goodie.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.480
It's fuckin' genius!

18:14.960 --> 18:16.960
I don't know how I got
me arse to fit on it, eh?

18:20.320 --> 18:22.040
Nearly broke the friggin' glass.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.200
So did you put it
on the computer?

18:26.280 --> 18:28.880
No, no no.
I wouldn't know how to.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.360
[Lou]
So who put it on the computer?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.000
What do you care?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.520
It was frickin'--
It was funny.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.360
What the fuck!

18:38.440 --> 18:40.880
-What's going on, Lou?
-Sorry, Booms, sorry.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.280
No, it's just we don't
like losing our privileges.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.040
-No, don't do it.
-Come on.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.360
Who did it?

18:47.440 --> 18:49.640
I don't know! I don't know.

18:49.720 --> 18:54.760
You know, Booms, I really wasn't
into the chicken shears shit.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.920
I think that was just mean.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.320
I reckon if you're gonna
be a cunt, don't be an
arsehole about it, so...

19:01.400 --> 19:03.360
Did you ever
smoke cigars, Booms?

19:03.440 --> 19:05.120
Eh?

19:05.200 --> 19:11.760
They use these fancy little
things to cut the ends off.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.600
And the blade's really sharp.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.280
Could just slice
through anything.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.000
Hey, you don't
have to use those.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.240
[Lou]
You shut your fuckin' mouth.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.040
-No, come on.
-Gimme that hand.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.440
Lou, look at me!
Look at me!

19:23.520 --> 19:26.040
Lou! Lou! Please!
Please Lou!

19:26.120 --> 19:29.520
Please please please,
please don't. Please don't!

19:29.600 --> 19:31.120
[pleading]

19:31.200 --> 19:32.880
You always did have
lovely manners, Booms.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.400
All right, I'll give
you one last chance.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.000
Who stuffed up our privileges?

19:39.080 --> 19:40.320
What...

19:41.240 --> 19:43.160
I don't know.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.200
-Come on.
-No, come on, I don't know.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.040
-Chop, chop!
-Just tell her, Boomer!

19:47.120 --> 19:49.040
No, I don't know. Don't--
[stammering]

19:49.120 --> 19:51.080
Don't, Judy doesn't know nothing
about privileges, all right?

19:51.160 --> 19:52.400
She's just a kid.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.680
She's just a kid,
so stop, just stop.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.000
There's that spineless
disloyalty I remember.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.920
Thanks, dumbarse.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.400
Fuckin', you--

20:17.000 --> 20:19.080
God, you're fuckin' stupid!

20:20.640 --> 20:21.960
You're stu--

20:28.960 --> 20:32.240
Hey, Ann, did you speak to
the Minister about Ferguson?

20:32.320 --> 20:34.480
He was hardly in the
mood to deal with that.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.560
Well I just wanna make sure
we were all on the same page.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.640
Let's just focus on the
prisoners who<i> are</i> here, yeah?

20:40.720 --> 20:43.280
I've been thinking that
you should transfer Louise Kelly

20:43.360 --> 20:44.920
into the laundry worker unit.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.840
Well, you can't do that.
Novak's in there.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.760
Move Novak into the
call centre fulltime.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.840
Well, top dog needs
to be in the laundry.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.160
The steam press belongs to
the top dog. Always has.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.280
That's ridiculous.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.680
It's the way it is.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.200
Look, this is a safety issue.

21:01.280 --> 21:06.160
I want Kelly and her crew
in the laundry where they
can protect Winter

21:06.240 --> 21:07.680
and the other high-risk inmates.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.000
So how're we gonna resolve this?

21:18.560 --> 21:21.360
I'll sanction it
on one condition.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.040
That you support Joan
Ferguson's transfer to Sydney.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.000
And I want
a cast iron guarantee.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.440
Fine.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.640
I mean it.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.080
She never comes back here.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.720
It's a done deal.

21:43.160 --> 21:48.160
So Lou Kelly is now in charge
of the most dangerous equipment
in this prison?

21:48.240 --> 21:53.480
I needed to make a deal to
guarantee that Ferguson
gets sent interstate.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.400
She's not coming back?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.000
No.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.000
Now we'll get you back
to the laundry eventually,

22:03.080 --> 22:04.920
but I'm looking
at the big picture.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.360
I don't care where you put me.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.000
Just as long as that freak never
sets foot in this prison again.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.520
What's goin' on?

22:21.600 --> 22:24.040
[Jake]
You're getting some extra help.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.760
Show them the ropes, Mitchell.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.240
Hey, where's Boomer?

22:27.320 --> 22:29.000
She's not feeling well.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.520
Ah, that's a pity.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.800
Get to work.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.840
Hey.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.120
Don't go anywhere.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.360
Don't worry, you're old news.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.960
Now, can you see
okay over there,

22:39.040 --> 22:41.280
or you want a
little box to stand on?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.920
Hey.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.640
Remember your day release.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.880
Laundry comes in,
it gets sorted over there.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.640
That's the washing pile,
that's the clean stuff.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.560
Folded there, pressed here.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.800
The end.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.440
Okay.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.840
Well, folks, let's get stuck in.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.480
So you okay?

23:11.360 --> 23:14.280
What happened with Boomer,
are you okay with that?

23:14.360 --> 23:16.560
Lou knows what she's doing.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.520
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
you have to follow her.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.080
Yeah, well, I'd follow her to
the end of the fuckin' world.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.960
Well, you're never gonna
get your top surgery if
you end up killing someone.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.760
Hey, we were never
gonna kill Boomer.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.560
Well, maybe not this time.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.480
[phone rings]

24:00.320 --> 24:01.520
Yes.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.240
You know what to do.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.240
It was a joke,
an exceedingly funny joke.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.400
Shut up and move.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.080
Take a break.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.280
Wow, so this is the slot?
Not bad.

24:18.360 --> 24:19.560
I've been in worse toilets.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.840
[Linda] Get in.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.280
It's a bit primitive.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.480
Take your clothes off.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.080
What?

24:27.160 --> 24:29.960
Strip down and chuck
your stuff out here.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.520
Sure.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.680
Fine, play your fucking games.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.400
Fun fact.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.280
Did you know that teal gets it
name from the coloured area

24:41.360 --> 24:42.920
around the eyes of
the common teal?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.720
It's a member of
the duck family.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.760
Keep going.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.400
Who would use such a beautiful
colour in an ugly prison?

24:57.480 --> 24:59.240
Who gives a rat's arse?

25:00.160 --> 25:02.640
Maybe a pack of cunts like you!

25:05.520 --> 25:06.720
[screaming]

25:06.800 --> 25:08.240
Fuck!

25:11.200 --> 25:12.440
[Judy crying]

25:15.000 --> 25:16.400
Help me!

25:18.760 --> 25:21.240
Ow! You fucking bitch!

25:31.080 --> 25:32.840
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

25:32.920 --> 25:35.080
-The prisoner was resisting--
-Get out of the way.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.680
Get in there.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.200
[medic] Hey, Judy.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.800
[Judy] It fucking burns!
They're on fire!

25:45.880 --> 25:48.080
I don't know what's
got into you.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.840
She sabotaged the
GM's presentation.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.120
How do you know it was her?

25:52.200 --> 25:54.040
I heard Jenkins
talking about it.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.040
That is no reason
to pepper spray her.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.640
The GM authorized me
to break her.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.400
To break her?

26:03.480 --> 26:07.120
-Open up.
-This is not a
concentration camp, Linda.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.720
If you've got a problem,
take it up with Ann.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.440
[medic]
Okay, and the other one.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.600
Today was a clusterfuck, Vera.
The Minister's furious.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.880
So, punish her, slot her,
cancel her privileges,

26:17.960 --> 26:19.720
but don't treat people
like that here.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.360
-Have you read her file?
-That punishment was
disproportionate.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.000
Have you read it?

26:29.480 --> 26:30.680
Yes, I have.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.760
Ann, are you okay?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.440
If you need to talk
about anything--

26:41.520 --> 26:43.200
Judy Bryant is a terrorist.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.280
She deserves
everything she gets.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.120
-Ann--
-I'm busy, Vera.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.640
I don't have time for this.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.720
Vera dob me in, did she?

27:11.800 --> 27:14.400
She's filed an
official complaint,

27:14.480 --> 27:17.200
and I don't blame her.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.360
What's going on, Linda?

27:19.440 --> 27:22.760
I was following
a direct order from the GM.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.760
What, and you didn't
think to question it?

27:25.840 --> 27:27.200
She's the boss.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.200
I'm writing you up
for misconduct.

27:33.280 --> 27:37.360
Any more of this behaviour
and I'll be looking for
a new deputy.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.920
[elevator dings]

27:40.000 --> 27:42.040
Jesus fucking Christ!

27:42.120 --> 27:44.520
I don't see why
I should be reprimanded
for punishing a prisoner.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.200
Don't worry about it.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.800
I'll make sure
you're not penalized.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.800
Thanks.

27:49.880 --> 27:53.800
If I have my way, we'll be
looking for a new Governor soon.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.760
You and I make
a pretty good team.

27:56.840 --> 28:00.800

[Jake] Jenkins.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.120
Mitchell and Novak.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.520
Welcome back.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.840
Hey, why is Judy in the slot?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.240
Long story.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.800
But Lou Kelly lagged on her.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.720
The fuck?

28:30.080 --> 28:32.600
Yeah, she wants to be top dog.
I told ya'.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.720
You know she's been
moved to the laundry.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.680
And I've been moved out.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.520
What? You're fuckin' kidding me?

28:40.600 --> 28:41.840
If she's planning a coup,

28:41.920 --> 28:44.680
we need to shut it down,
once and for all.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.800
[distant moaning]

29:11.480 --> 29:12.680
Hey.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.600
What are you thinking about?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.800
What's it to you?

29:17.880 --> 29:21.200
-You know if you
ever want to talk--
-He doesn't.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.480
Not to you.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.280
That shit with Boomer.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.360
Don't ever undermine me again.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.720
Well, you got what
you wanted, didn't you?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.320
I was just playing good cop.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.840
You don't play shit
without my say so. Mm-hmm.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.400
Are we clear?

29:37.480 --> 29:39.160
[shouting]
Are we clear?!

29:39.240 --> 29:40.480
Let's go to bed, babe.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.600
Of course.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.360
Would you really have cut
Boomer's finger off?

30:17.640 --> 30:22.520
You know, I've been in these
places since I was a kid,
and you either...

30:22.600 --> 30:26.800
you grow up and you get on
the front fuckin' foot or you--

30:28.320 --> 30:31.000
Well, I mean, you've seen them.
You wanna count them?

30:37.160 --> 30:39.280
But, Reb, if I ever
make you feel like--

30:41.480 --> 30:42.680
I'm not afraid of you.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.200
Good.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.760
And I'm not going anywhere.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.200
Good.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.760
I mean, there's not really
anywhere for you to go, so...

31:13.880 --> 31:15.880
-Ready?
-You bet.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.920
This is so weird.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.440
-Eddie.
-G'day, Rubes.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.800
Hey, how're you doin'?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.400
Sign here, please.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.320
Curfew time's
4:00 p.m. on the dot.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.680
Make sure she's back
before then, eh?

31:34.760 --> 31:36.080
Yeah, no worries, brother.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.200
Thanks, Mr. Stewart.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.120
-So, where we headed?
-Out of town.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.880
Aren't you looking
for accommodation?

31:45.960 --> 31:47.200
You need to live central.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.920
Change of plans.
You got the burner?

31:50.640 --> 31:51.840
In the car.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.320

Kelly.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.160
Ah, sorry, lips.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.960
Didn't anyone tell you, you
don't work here anymore?

32:33.360 --> 32:34.560
I'm not here to work.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.520
And I'm not just taking
one finger this time.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.040
I warned you,
but you just don't listen.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.880
You attacked Ruby and
Boomer, and now it's gonna stop.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.120
You know, I like that,
sticking up for your friends.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.360
We respect that,
don't we, folks?

33:14.840 --> 33:16.640
I got some friends too, you see.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.560
If you wanna fight me,
that's fine. I just
don't like your odds.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.040
[Jake] Oi!

33:28.120 --> 33:29.680
What the hell's going on?

33:31.040 --> 33:33.280
Novak, you're not
meant to be here.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.440
Sorry. Forgot.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.840
She is such a ditz.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.080
[Linda]
Clear the cameras, right now.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.960

Back to work!

33:46.200 --> 33:47.400
Come on!

33:49.080 --> 33:50.120
See you around.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.560
Yes, please.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.280
See you, Booms.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.440
[Linda] Come on!

34:34.360 --> 34:36.440
I shouldn't be long.
Don't go far.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.000
Yeah, okay.
Don't go do nothin' stupid.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.600

Come on, Eddie. It's me.

you're behaving like this.

I know.

I think I have to
tell you something.

Yep.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.960

41:17.720 --> 41:19.600
So I have some hang-ups...

41:19.680 --> 41:24.560
about... terrorists
like Judy Bryant.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.080
I had no idea.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.800
Why didn't you tell me?

41:34.880 --> 41:38.760
Because I... I never wanted
to talk about it.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.200
But I'm-- [stammering]
I'm dealing with it.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.360
I'm dealing with it.
At least I'm...

41:44.440 --> 41:47.480
I am trying so hard.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.680
But every time
there's another attack,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.960
I'm just right...
I'm just right back there.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.520
Ann, I'm so sorry. I--

42:07.480 --> 42:09.200
-[knocking]
-Oh, not now.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.520
[Jake]
Is Ann in there with you?

42:10.600 --> 42:11.880
The Minister's on the phone.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.400
I'll be right there.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.480
So now you know.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.720
If there's anything I can do.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.040
[sniffs]

42:44.120 --> 42:47.040
Just having someone to
talk to is really good.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.760
Well, what about if we go for
that drink tonight? I could
just get Jake to babysit.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.280
Yes, that would be lovely.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.440
Thank you, Vera.

43:08.520 --> 43:12.760
[Ann] I can assure you,
the prisoner responsible
has been found and punished.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.680
Yes Minister, but my
projections still stand

43:16.760 --> 43:19.280
so isn't that what's
important here?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.240
Yes, of course--

43:23.920 --> 43:25.320
[hangs up phone]

43:26.280 --> 43:27.480
Damage control?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.280
Yeah.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.920
The uh...
hospital got in touch.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.200
They're saying Ferguson's fit
for release, so I've prepared
the transfer papers.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.400
She's ready to go
straight to Sydney.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.480
Yeah, I'm afraid
that won't be happening.

43:42.600 --> 43:43.800
No...

43:45.080 --> 43:46.360
No...

43:47.160 --> 43:48.800
-We had a deal.
-I know.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.960
But it wasn't my decision,
it was the Minister's.

43:51.040 --> 43:55.000
Look, I'll accept
20 A-Class prisoners
from anywhere you want.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.760
But Ferguson can't
come back here.

43:56.840 --> 43:59.960
I am genuinely sorry but
there is nothing I can do.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.160
[sighs]

44:16.480 --> 44:20.520
Jake? Mitchell's not back.
It's past 4:00.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.520
I told her about
the curfew like 12 times.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.080
Who signed her out?

44:24.160 --> 44:26.360
Her boxing manager.
They were going to the city.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.640
Chase him up.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.560
Roo, is that you?

44:49.560 --> 44:50.960
[Jones]<i> Hey, Rita.</i>

44:51.880 --> 44:53.120
It's Jonesy.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.480
<i>I'm here with Morelli.</i>

44:55.560 --> 44:58.920
<i>You're a really hard woman</i>
<i>to track down, you know that?</i>

44:59.000 --> 45:01.880
And yeah, we got your
sister here too, by the way.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.960
You let her go or
I swear I will kill you.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.400
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen, Connors.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.560
Not until you retract that

45:07.640 --> 45:09.000
<i>bullshit statement about us.</i>

45:09.080 --> 45:10.520
It's not bullshit,
and you know it.

45:10.600 --> 45:13.560
Too bad. See the way
we see it is,

45:13.640 --> 45:15.160
if you wanna see Ruby
back in one piece,

45:15.240 --> 45:18.520
then you just do
exactly what I say.

45:18.560 --> 45:22.280
[intense music rises]
