10:20.369 --> 10:21.621
You think this was the plan?

10:21.912 --> 10:25.374
Make babies fall in love with the toys
just so he could take them away?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.086
I will avenge you, Bobo.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.174
And then I said,
"I  did  write my name on it, Steve."

10:33.257 --> 10:36.052
And then Steve said,
"Oh, are you calling me a yogurt stealer?"

10:36.135 --> 10:38.346
So I said, "Yeah, I guess I am, Steve."

10:38.512 --> 10:41.015
Then guess what I did
to his filing cabinet.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.267
[Mom] What's wrong with the baby?

10:44.935 --> 10:47.271
His new toy got recalled,
and he's depressed.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.565
Whoa-oh. [gasps]

10:49.649 --> 10:52.693
You know who feeds on sad babies?

10:52.777 --> 10:55.196
The neck fart monster!

10:55.279 --> 10:58.240
[blows raspberries]

10:58.908 --> 11:01.661
Wow. Nothing. What do we do, Ted?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.830
I don't know. But do you know who would?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.375
Dr. Tickle!

11:07.458 --> 11:09.418
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.336
[blows raspberry]

11:10.419 --> 11:14.382
Oh, no! Spittle makes Dr. Tickle
melt like a banana splittle!

11:14.465 --> 11:16.759
[chuckles] I love Dr. Tickle!

11:17.301 --> 11:19.428
Glad someone does. Tough crowd.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.098
He'll be fine.
We just need to get his toy back.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.684
Oh, honey, by now, I'm sure
all the toys have been destroyed.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.813
-[whimpers, crying]
-Whoa!

11:28.896 --> 11:30.481
Sounds like a thirsty baby.

11:30.731 --> 11:31.774
You want some milk?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.443
[gasps] My yogurt!

11:34.735 --> 11:38.280
Oh. I gotta call Steve
before he looks in his filing cabinet.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.575
Look at you all. [clicks tongue]

11:41.659 --> 11:44.328
[huffs] Don't you have a TV to watch?

11:44.578 --> 11:46.997
You know, when I lost my slot car track--

11:47.081 --> 11:49.250
Ugh. Again with the slot car track.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.168
I thought I'd never laugh again.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.378
And I never did.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.089
For a long time.
But you wanna know what helped?

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
Jokes. [clears throat]

11:58.884 --> 12:00.511
What do you call a pork chop?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.806
A pig that does karate!

12:03.889 --> 12:05.683
[chuckles]

12:05.766 --> 12:07.768
Oh, wait. I got it mixed up.

12:07.852 --> 12:08.936
[gasps, grunts]

12:09.019 --> 12:10.104
My comedy career!

12:10.438 --> 12:11.272
Where's Jimbo?

12:11.355 --> 12:14.900
[muffled laughter] Right here,
where I've been the whole time.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.902
-[snorting]
-Is it just me,

12:16.986 --> 12:19.613
or does Jimbo
suddenly seem happier?

12:19.697 --> 12:22.408
What? I'm not happy.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.534
[chuckling]

12:23.742 --> 12:26.078
He's so happy he can't stand it.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.039
-He came from there, behind the sofa.
-[Jimbo] No!

12:29.123 --> 12:31.542
Jimbo, I swear,
if there's a kitten behind that couch...

12:32.293 --> 12:35.087
Yes, it is a kitten.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.630
Meow!

12:37.923 --> 12:38.757
Plushythingy!

12:39.133 --> 12:40.718
But how?

12:40.801 --> 12:44.472
Can I hold it, Jimbo? Jimbo? Jimbo?
Can I hold it?

12:44.555 --> 12:47.475
-Jimbo, can I hold it? Jimbo.
-Turn her off! She's scaring me!

12:47.558 --> 12:49.560
Can I hold it? Jimbo? Now!

12:49.643 --> 12:52.730
Forget her, Jimbo. I'm the boss.
I get first cuddle.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.398
[whimpering]

12:54.482 --> 12:56.775
-Jimbo, I'm ordering you to--
-Ha!

12:56.859 --> 12:57.860
-Oh!
-[cackling]

12:57.943 --> 12:58.861
[yelps, grunts]

12:58.944 --> 13:01.071
-Ha! [panting]
-Oof!

13:01.155 --> 13:04.033
[all grunting]

13:04.116 --> 13:05.117
Stop!

13:06.285 --> 13:07.578
Would you look at yourselves?

13:07.661 --> 13:10.873
Tripping, fighting, hitting...
Spitting, Staci?

13:11.207 --> 13:12.875
I should call the old people right now

13:12.958 --> 13:14.919
and tell them they missed
one Plushythingy.

13:15.002 --> 13:15.961
No! Stop him!

13:16.587 --> 13:18.756
-Ah!
-[all grunting]

13:18.839 --> 13:19.673
Guys!

13:20.132 --> 13:22.635
Gag him! We'll stow him in the basement
till the heat cools off.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.303
Don't you see yourselves? You're--

13:24.386 --> 13:26.847
[muffled grunting]

13:26.931 --> 13:30.059
Wait, wait. Stop. He has a point.
Go on, Templeton.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.811
[grunting continues]

13:32.895 --> 13:36.649
Hmm. Well spoken.
What's worse than no toys for any baby?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.568
One toy that all babies want!

13:39.735 --> 13:41.612
-[grunting continues]
-[Staci gasps]

13:41.695 --> 13:45.658
Tim's right! Frederic knew
we'd tear each other apart over this.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.117
What Tim said!

13:47.201 --> 13:48.619
So there's only one solution.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.165
-I should take it.
-But I'll just die without it.

13:53.249 --> 13:57.169
And my ghost will haunt your posterity
for seven generations!

13:57.336 --> 13:59.129
[all grunting]

13:59.213 --> 14:02.132
You're missing the point.
This is exactly what he wants.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.135
As long as this exists,
the team is doomed.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.263
Then, who's gonna fight for babies?

14:07.471 --> 14:09.306
There's only one thing we can do.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.269
Destroy Plushythingy
or it will destroy us.

14:13.435 --> 14:17.147
But not at all me. Just the three of you.
It's the toy or the team.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.315
Make the call.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.944
Jimbo, send it off honorably.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.114
[grunts]

14:26.115 --> 14:28.242
-[grunts]
-You've got to let go, Jimbo.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.704
-[grunts] I'm trying. I can't!
-I got this.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.957
-[inhales, exhales]
-[whimpers]

14:35.833 --> 14:38.544
Just close my eyes,
pretend I'm back in daycare

14:38.627 --> 14:41.505
and Braden just took
the good carpet square.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.553
[yells]

14:47.970 --> 14:50.014
My body won't let me!

14:51.557 --> 14:54.143
I have too many feelings!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.811
Fine. I'll do it.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.152
[yells]

15:03.903 --> 15:04.737
Uh...

15:06.614 --> 15:07.448
Boss.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.911
What is wrong with you babies?

15:13.370 --> 15:15.372
Templeton, what do you think you're doing?

15:15.456 --> 15:16.957
Bon voyage, sailor.

15:17.041 --> 15:17.958
Shh!

15:18.042 --> 15:19.543
-Do you hear that?
-What?

15:19.752 --> 15:24.757
The sound of your old Kentucky Outlaw
slot car, vrooming down the track.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.634
-[whispers] I can hear it!
-But wait!

15:26.717 --> 15:29.053
What's that rumbling noise? The water!

15:29.136 --> 15:31.138
Templeton, it's so cold!

15:31.221 --> 15:34.183
The basement rats
are singing a funeral dirge.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.560
[vocalizing]

15:39.104 --> 15:43.275
Your toy didn't deserve that,
and neither does this one.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.863
[yells]

15:49.990 --> 15:53.994
Now, if all of us can just come together
and form a rational solution,

15:54.078 --> 15:56.747
-this whole thing--
-Couldn't agree more! Ha!

15:58.332 --> 16:00.501
[all grunting]

16:00.584 --> 16:01.919
-Timmy!
-Gigi!

16:02.169 --> 16:03.545
There's my Bobo back.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.339
BB, hide the toy!

16:05.714 --> 16:07.591
Okay, Dumpy Sad Face,

16:08.342 --> 16:11.011
time to flip that frown
with a Gigi car ride.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.389
Tim, find my keys. You're coming, too.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.641
-[both growling]
-The perfect escape.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.645
Together forever,
miles away from any other baby.

16:19.895 --> 16:20.938
Ta-da!

16:21.021 --> 16:22.856
Look at all these other babies.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.650
I didn't think it was possible,

16:24.733 --> 16:26.694
but she's even worse
when she tries to be nice.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.029
If this joint can't get
your baby spirits up,

16:29.113 --> 16:30.364
I don't know what will.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.992
Have fun, boys.
I'll be in the grown-up lounge.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.786
Templeton, we have to get out of here.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.121
I remember this place.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.624
Free advice: stay away from the ball pit.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.544
-[shrieks]
-[chomps]

16:43.752 --> 16:47.214
If any baby sees what I've got
behind my back, I'm applesauce.

16:47.297 --> 16:52.011
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you, um, got a toy?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.263
No, shoot. There must be a lesson here.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.306

-What? Hey!

He knows everything.
We'll have to take him out.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.239
What? He's a baby.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.699
-[coos]
-Shh.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.909
He'll alert the whole place.
You have to silence him!

17:15.993 --> 17:17.453
Seriously? No!

17:17.536 --> 17:19.496
I just mean put a bottle in his mouth.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.581
Oh.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.375
-He doesn't have a bottle.
-Then create a diversion.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.253
No one can see what I have--
[grunts] Oh!

17:28.881 --> 17:30.007

17:35.846 --> 17:37.097
-Templeton, help me!
-[giggling]

17:37.181 --> 17:38.766
He can't take that much love!

17:38.849 --> 17:41.018
He's very poorly built!

17:41.727 --> 17:43.562

-What's worse? Jimbo takes it,

18:17.429 --> 18:20.933
or it gets torn to shreds

in seconds!

-No, that's fair.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.818
I was afraid it might come to this,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.404
so I had the triplets bring in
an old friend of yours

19:57.487 --> 19:59.364
to help teach
an important business lesson.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.492
You know what separates
those on bottom from those on top?

Leverage.

20:07.748 --> 20:12.336
Picture it, just the two Templeton boys
with the toys that make them happiest.

20:12.753 --> 20:17.633
We'll never know sadness, loneliness,
boredom ever again.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.801
Simply hand me Plushythingy,

20:20.177 --> 20:23.388
then you get the car set,
we take the zip-line down to Gigi,

20:23.639 --> 20:26.516

20:59.800 --> 21:01.093
Forget it, you guys.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.346
You have to learn to let it go.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.392
I just saw my dream toy busted,
for the second time in my life.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.310
And you know what? No big deal.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.062
Let the kid have it.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.106
[giggling]

21:15.732 --> 21:19.236
-Nope, still want it!
-[woman] Simon, time to go home!

21:19.653 --> 21:22.656
Guys, seriously, let it go!

21:23.282 --> 21:24.658
This is the lesson.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.536
If you really love something,
you have to--

-[sizzling]
-[all scream]

21:30.622 --> 21:31.665
Holy smokes!

21:32.082 --> 21:35.002
It really does burst into chemical flame
when exposed to human saliva.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.880
-[shouts]
-[all scream]

21:42.050 --> 21:44.886
Die, abomination! Die! Die!

21:44.970 --> 21:47.014
Uh, you were in the middle
of a lesson, Templeton?

21:47.097 --> 21:49.433
Ugh. Who cares? Let's go home.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.564
I can't believe Gigi bought this for us!

21:55.647 --> 21:57.232
She really knows how to brighten our day

21:57.316 --> 22:01.028
after we were almost burned alive
in a fire sparked by my own foolishness.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.698
Two loops!
Who knew there could be two loops?

22:05.574 --> 22:08.744
Are you sure you're okay,
about Plushythingy and everything?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.579
Never been better, Templeton.

22:10.662 --> 22:14.166
Now... [yawns] If you'll excuse me,
I think I'm gonna turn in.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.425
Mr. Charrington.

22:23.842 --> 22:27.721
Something tells me you and I
will be in business forever.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.016
-I knew it!
-No! No! [grunts]

22:31.099 --> 22:33.351
-Templeton! Let me have this one thing!
-Let go!

22:33.435 --> 22:34.269
[fabric tears]

22:34.353 --> 22:36.855
-[Boss Baby] Ah! Rusty nails!
-[Tim] Don't touch the high-voltage wires!

22:36.938 --> 22:38.857
-[Boss Baby] Rest in peace, Bobo!
-[Tim] Run!

22:38.940 --> 22:40.275
