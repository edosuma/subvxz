Oh, honey, you don't look so good.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.433
You should stay home from brunch.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.158
- Are you sure?
- Mmm.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.508
I really want to go.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.477
You stay and rest.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.028
You can see Grandma when we get back.

<i>Wanna fuck me, baby?</i>

01:34.400 --> 01:35.549
Oh, yes. Yeah.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.232
<i>You wanna fuck me?</i>

01:41.840 --> 01:44.912
Hey, Erik. Do you know if your dad
still has my clippers?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.719
I have no idea, Mr. Williams.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.519
All right. Go back to what you were doing.

<i>Oh, do me, baby.</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:21.029
<i>Honey.</i>

02:21.160 --> 02:22.912
<i>Yeah, just like that.</i>

02:23.000 --> 02:26.151
<i>Oh, yeah! So good, so good, baby.</i>

02:26.320 --> 02:27.673
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

02:29.840 --> 02:31.319
I told you I was paying.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.994
So what's the difference
if you forgot the coupon?

02:34.080 --> 02:35.593
Honey, she doesn't like to waste money.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.716
There's no way I'm letting you pay full price

02:37.800 --> 02:41.315
when there's a two-for-one coupon
sitting on the counter.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.469
I'll be right out.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.596
I'm coming, too. Now I gotta pee.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.715
I'll check on Erik.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.835
ERIK: Oh, yeah.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.592
<i>Oh. Oh, that's good.</i>

02:48.680 --> 02:50.875
<i>- You like that? I like that, too.
- Oh, yeah!</i>

02:52.040 --> 02:53.075
HARRY: Here we go.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.149
MOTHER: Okay, Mom.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.992
<i>- Harder.
- Harder? Okay.</i>

02:56.080 --> 02:57.149
<i>Oh, yeah! So good.</i>

02:57.240 --> 02:58.958
<i>- Like this?
- Yeah, right there, babe.</i>

02:59.040 --> 03:00.268
<i>- Like this? Like this?
- Yeah.</i>

03:00.360 --> 03:01.839
<i>Baby, do me just like that.</i>

03:03.160 --> 03:04.195
Okay, attagirl.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.311
<i>- From behind?
- Oh, yeah, baby! Harder!</i>

03:07.400 --> 03:08.719
- Okay.
- All right.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.038
<i>- You wanna cum for me, baby?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

03:11.120 --> 03:13.031
<i>- Yeah? Cum for me, baby.
- I'm so close. I will.</i>

03:14.240 --> 03:15.275
<i>You're gonna cum for me?</i>

03:15.360 --> 03:16.475
I'm about to. I'm about to.

Grandma. Grandma.

<i>ERIK: And that's the day
my grandmother died.</i>

03:39.560 --> 03:42.677
<i>And it's pretty much the story of my life.
But let me back things up a little bit.</i>

03:49.720 --> 03:52.632
<i>That's me. Not exactly the life of the party.</i>

03:55.680 --> 03:57.318
<i>That's my buddy, Mike Coozeman.</i>

03:57.400 --> 04:00.870
<i>Everybody calls him Cooze
'cause that's all he's ever interested in.</i>

04:00.960 --> 04:04.270
<i>Cooze is a self-proclaimed ladies' man
and a legend in his own mind.</i>

04:04.360 --> 04:05.634
<i>Sometimes his methods are...</i>

04:05.720 --> 04:07.039
(GROANS)

04:07.120 --> 04:08.519
<i>questionable.</i>

04:10.160 --> 04:11.479
Very smooth.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.236
Oh, please. I consider that foreplay.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.355
Where's Ryan?

04:15.440 --> 04:16.428
I don't know.

04:16.519 --> 04:20.957
Last time I saw him,
he was dancing with Stacey and Shelly.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.994
<i>ERIK: That's my best friend, Ryan Grimm.</i>

04:25.840 --> 04:27.910
<i>I don't know how he does it.</i>

04:30.160 --> 04:33.072
See, I told you there was enough
for both of you.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.354
<i>He moved here in second grade.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:38.069
<i>Believe it or not, back then,
I was the one showing him the ropes.</i>

04:38.160 --> 04:39.798
<i>Now he's the quarterback
of the football team,</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:42.030
<i>and the coolest guy in school.</i>

04:42.120 --> 04:45.157
Hey, I brought you a vodka and ginger ale
so it won't upset your stomach.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.435
Oh, thanks.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.353
<i>That's my girlfriend, Tracy.</i>

04:51.000 --> 04:52.513
<i>We met in Biology, junior year.</i>

04:52.600 --> 04:55.433
TEACHER: Now make the first
incision into your frogs.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.630
Cut along the ventral side from the pelvic
to the pectoral girdle.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.315
Oh!

05:03.720 --> 05:05.472
<i>I don't know what she saw in me,</i>

05:05.560 --> 05:09.599
<i>but when I finally got up the nerve
to ask her out, she said yes.</i>

05:11.120 --> 05:14.078
<i>And for some reason,
she kept going out with me.</i>

05:15.320 --> 05:17.470
<i>It's like she totally gets me.</i>

05:19.280 --> 05:21.350
<i>And I try my best to get her.</i>

05:27.600 --> 05:30.068
Come on. Take the low one. It's easy.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.875
(SIGHING)

05:32.960 --> 05:34.154
Screw it.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.918
(HORSE NEIGHING)

05:39.840 --> 05:40.875
Oh!

05:44.200 --> 05:45.838
Are you all right?

05:46.520 --> 05:49.671
I don't know.
Is it possible to break your ass?

05:49.920 --> 05:53.230
Okay, I promise I'll never make you
ride a horse again.

05:54.200 --> 05:58.034
<i>Looks like she's perfect, right?
There's just one problem.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:04.672
<i>Tracy's not ready to have sex yet,
so that makes me a virgin.</i>

06:05.520 --> 06:08.637
<i>Now, being one of the only virgins in school
is bad enough,</i>

06:09.120 --> 06:11.156
<i>but it's even worse for me.</i>

06:13.120 --> 06:14.235
<i>Yup.</i>

06:14.520 --> 06:15.589
<i>I'm a Stifler.</i>

06:16.320 --> 06:18.709
<i>My cousins are the legendary Stifler boys.</i>

06:18.800 --> 06:23.316
<i>Steve, his brother, Matt,
and our other cousin, Dwight.</i>

06:24.480 --> 06:26.675
<i>You see, with my last name
comes responsibility,</i>

06:26.760 --> 06:29.354
<i>a reputation that I'm supposed to live up to.</i>

06:29.520 --> 06:32.990
<i>Unfortunately, I've let down the family name
on more than one occasion.</i>

06:33.080 --> 06:34.308
What's your problem, Erik?

06:34.400 --> 06:37.233
Your cousin would've helped me
steal this beer.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.790
Dude, a real Stifler
would have totally fucked that goat.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.634
If you were really a Stifler,
you would have nailed Tracy by now.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.434
<i>ERIK: Stifler.</i>

06:47.160 --> 06:50.789
<i>My name, my legacy, my curse.</i>

06:54.920 --> 06:57.798
I can't believe you killed your grandmother
from jerking off.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.472
The coroner's findings were inconclusive.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.199
Why are you still whacking it
to that dumpster porn?

07:02.280 --> 07:05.158
Yeah, why don't you just go on the Internet
like a normal person?

07:05.240 --> 07:07.037
Well, because my mom
put on that CyberNanny

07:07.120 --> 07:09.953
after you spent the entire night looking up
German fetish porn.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.190
Man, you are pathetic.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.080
You know who I blame for this? Tracy.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.593
What? Why?

07:16.680 --> 07:19.114
Because, if she would just give up
a little ass,

07:19.200 --> 07:23.318
then maybe you wouldn't be killing
your relatives with your money shot.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.995
Erik, you cannot graduate a virgin.
For Christ's sake, you're a Stifler.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.390
Hey, sweetie. How was your math class?

07:39.480 --> 07:41.789
It was all right. How was English?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.836
Pretty interesting, actually.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.433
You know that kid
that I always tell you about?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.557
- He was doing that pencil thing all...
- That's cool.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.109
You okay?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.599
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:54.160 --> 07:58.199
Erik, we've been dating for two years.
I know when something's bothering you.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.508
Nothing's wrong.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.239
I don't know why you think
you have this psychic ability to read me.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.595
Because I do. What is it?

08:05.520 --> 08:08.557
You're gonna think I'm an asshole.
Let's just forget about it.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.155
Come on, Erik, you know you can talk to me
about anything.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.993
All right.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.473
It's the sex.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.715
I mean,

08:23.800 --> 08:26.872
we've been together for two years.
Two years, Trace.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.235
I mean, when we were juniors,
it was one thing,

08:29.320 --> 08:30.912
but we're seniors now,
and this whole virgin thing

08:31.000 --> 08:33.389
is starting to have
some serious consequences.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.390
I mean, people are dying.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.238
I told you, I'm not ready yet.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.275
I am so ready.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.794
Can't I be ready enough for the both of us?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.711
It doesn't work that way.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.313
It should.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.229
I'm sorry, Erik.
I know how patient you've been.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.550
I know. It's just sometimes...

08:52.040 --> 08:53.029
What?

08:53.320 --> 08:57.029
Well, you're a girl.
It's a lot easier for you to be a virgin

08:57.120 --> 08:59.918
because the longer you stay a virgin,
the more pure and innocent you seem.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.319
The longer I stay a virgin,

09:01.400 --> 09:04.836
the more I become the laughingstock
of the entire school.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.077
I'm sorry, but... I mean...

09:08.160 --> 09:09.912
I'm sorry I brought it up.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.632
(BELL RINGING)

09:11.720 --> 09:13.995
I gotta go. I'll see you after school.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.115
Okay.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.349
Bye.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.078
I'm telling you, his dick was this big.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.029
NATALIE: What about Erik?
I bet he's got a big one.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.997
Well, Tracy wouldn't know.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.069
Whatever.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.719
Yeah, I guess it's pretty hard
to figure out dick size from dry humping.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.074
Brooke, that's mean.

09:41.160 --> 09:44.072
Just because I don't have a catalog
of the school's dick sizes like you,

09:44.160 --> 09:46.116
doesn't mean I don't know a thing or two.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.998
Okay, so how big is Erik's?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.635
See? Told you.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.039
Come on, Brooke.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.553
It's not like that with us.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.835
I mean, Erik's different.
He respects my boundaries.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.876
Well, you better give that boy
a reason to stick around,

09:59.960 --> 10:02.474
or he's gonna find a girl
with looser boundaries.

10:02.880 --> 10:03.995
Erik would never do that.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.638
Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.076
He broke up with you over sex,
and that was sophomore year.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.038
Yeah, this just isn't gonna
work without the sex.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.434
God, Trent is cute,
and I heard he just broke up with Holly.

10:17.320 --> 10:21.279
Look, Tracy, we love you, and we love Erik,
but let's get real.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.109
He's a guy, and guys have certain needs.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.875
They really do.
It's like a caveman thing or something.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.350
Yeah, I can't believe
you've kept him tied up this long.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.310
Hey, Erik, guess who I just talked to?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.435
Who?

10:35.520 --> 10:37.476
Your cousin Stifler up at Michigan.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.913
Why are you talking to my cousin Dwight?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.991
Oh, we talk all the time.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.399
What? We have a lot in common.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.232
What's that crazy bastard up to?

10:44.320 --> 10:47.915
He's in some fraternity,
and all those guys do is drink and fuck.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.639
And it just so happens that they're throwing
a monster party this weekend

10:50.720 --> 10:51.755
for the Naked Mile.

10:51.840 --> 10:52.909
What's the Naked Mile?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.718
Oh, dude, it's this thing
where thousands of students

10:54.800 --> 10:56.119
run naked through campus.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.316
It's the way of blowing off
steam after exams.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.118
Thousands of naked chicks?

11:00.200 --> 11:03.078
Stifler says that this party is gonna be epic.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.230
Bottom line is, this place is played out.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.594
High school's over for us.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.557
It's time to plant our flag in a new land.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.350
Porn, cumshot, dead grandmother,
grounded forever?

11:12.440 --> 11:13.475
Don't worry.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.711
Just tell your parents that, you know,
you're thinking about going to school there.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.631
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, please.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.234
Your mom cried when you told her
you were going to school in Boston.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.914
She'll probably help you pack
if she thinks it'll keep you close to home.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.194
I'll help you pack.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.874
I'll make sandwiches.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.035
Chicken salad?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.155
Of course.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.151
Are you gonna get a chance
to see your cousin?

11:31.240 --> 11:33.993
Yeah. We might stop by and say hello.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.833
Now, there's someone you
should definitely look up to.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.195
I bet he doesn't have time
to blow his load on his family.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.952
- Harry, please.
- HARRY: I don't understand.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.112
When I was your age,
I was up to my neck in poontang.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.556
I didn't have time to spank my monkey.

Nice. Chicken salad and college pussy.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.116
I didn't think people your age
knew about that kind of stuff.

56:00.200 --> 56:03.158
I believe I know more
about this than you think.

56:04.680 --> 56:07.353
Good, because I just
don't know what to do here.

56:07.440 --> 56:10.955
I mean, I've got
this smoking-hot sorority girl all over me.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.037
Well, you know, my son Jim

56:15.120 --> 56:17.236
went through kind of a similar dilemma.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.117
He was going out with this very attractive

56:19.200 --> 56:21.077
foreign-exchange student named Nadia.

56:21.160 --> 56:24.436
Right, right, yeah. That's the one he blew his
load too early with, right?

56:24.520 --> 56:25.589
- Yes.
- Twice.

56:25.680 --> 56:26.954
- Yes.
- Over the Internet.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.632
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yeah.

56:28.720 --> 56:31.917
Well, blowing loads aside...

56:32.000 --> 56:33.035
Yeah.

56:33.120 --> 56:35.350
The next summer Nadia came
to visit Jim at the beach,

56:35.440 --> 56:36.839
and he turned her down

56:36.920 --> 56:40.151
because he had fallen in love with Michelle,

56:40.960 --> 56:44.794
who he later married,
and is now the mother of my grandchild.

56:46.040 --> 56:49.669
So you're saying
I shouldn't hook up with this sorority girl?

56:50.000 --> 56:53.037
I'm saying I think
only you know the answer to that, Erik.

56:55.520 --> 56:57.033
Well, gotta run.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.475
Oh, Erik, I was sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.631
Last night was amazing.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.116
Yeah, it was.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.998
The three of us should
do it again sometime.

57:29.360 --> 57:30.679

57:32.880 --> 57:34.199

You know how to get to Murray Street?

57:44.760 --> 57:48.070
Oh, yeah, man.
Just go right down Maryland, down to...

wearing all black and ski masks.

58:53.760 --> 58:56.911

Are you gonna be able to run in the Mile?

58:57.000 --> 58:58.228
Doesn't look like it.

We will find those little fuckers.

59:04.520 --> 59:09.196
No. I appreciate it, okay?
Stifler'll think of something.

59:09.800 --> 59:13.190

to do two things: Have fun,

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

out of here so I can get some sleep.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.509

Listen, I know what you're going through.

59:37.360 --> 59:40.193
- You do?
- Sure, yeah. I had the same problem

59:46.200 --> 59:48.668
Yeah. What did you do?

59:50.720 --> 59:54.349
Well, I whipped out
my dick in class, stole the principal's car,

59:54.440 --> 59:55.953
and then I fucked a lunch lady.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.549
Oh.

It's not for me to decide or advise.
You gotta figure that out on your own.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.395
But I will say this.
We got a pretty fucked-up family,

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.514
and it's nice having a guy like you around.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.432

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.999
I'm fine.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.196
Come on, sweetie. Let's finish this thing.

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:22.716
I'm standing at the finish
line of a very proud, but strange tradition

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.948
called the Naked Mile.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.359
Ever year after exams

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:27.715
hundreds of students
run a mile through campus

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.756
in nothing more than their birthday suits.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.752
(LAUGHING)

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.798
This is the greatest thing ever!

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.836
Hell, yeah!

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.956
I can't believe we did this!

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.317
Yeah! Naked Mile, baby!

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.830
Beta House fucking rules!

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:57.319
Come on, marathon men.
Let's get ready for the party.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.631
I did it. I really did it.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.113
Way to go, Coz. That's my cousin.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.675
DWIGHT: Yeah, buddy!

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.871
Some people call it lewd behavior,

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.793
but the students say it's just
a good way to blow off steam.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.149

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.078

Holy shit! Is this even the same house?

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.753
I think I had a wet dream
that started like this.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.354
It's those guys.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.589
And ended like that.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.954
Wow, taking those pills

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.918
might just be the best thing
you guys ever did for your social lives.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.069
Oh, yeah.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.515
You wanna dance?

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.670
Is my dick hard?
Of course the Cooze wants to dance.

(SCREAMS)

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.033
Are you gonna dance, sexy?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.429
Or are you one of those
football players who's too cool to dance?

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.512
Oh, baby, they don't call me
the White Shadow for nothing.

Come on, cutie.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.279
What a bastard.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.477
I told you to call off
that stupid guilt-free pass.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.990
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.077
Is there anything we can do for you?

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.631
No, I think I just want to be alone.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.757
No way. We are not leaving you alone
so you can beat yourself up.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.513
Yeah, but I told him to do it.
I mean, I can't get mad about it now.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.433
Would you quit being so logical, Tracy?
We're girls.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.715
Boys should know better
than to trust us to be rational.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.835
It's not in our nature.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.478
It's really not.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.109
So, you are going to get dressed.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.872
Then, we're going to Allison's party.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.590
That will get your mind off of Erik.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.272
I don't want to.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.636
Well, you don't have a vote in this.
Now get dressed.

Check out our boy.
Think he's going to lose it tonight?

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.349
Nope. Bet he screws it up
and ends up jerking off in the bathroom.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.953

Do you guys have any idea how much
everybody here has been talking about you?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.438

For the first phase of the competition,

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.590
a bucket will be hung
on the dong of each of our contestants.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.877
That bucket will be filled
with a pitcher of beer.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.748
First person to drop the bucket is the loser.

- Come on.

Completely ridiculous.

No, but you need to get back
on the same level.

you decide to do it with Erik.

already had sex with some other girl.

Look, nine-ball.

- Erik?
- Yes?

Because I doubt I'll be very good.

I heard about what happened,

and I wanted to let you know
that I didn't know anything about it.

You're not just here to set me up?

to let anything happen to that gorgeous face.

to be dancing on enemy territory like this?

- but there is something about you.
- Yeah?

Well, I tend to have
that effect on pacifist, vegan bisexuals.

This guy's got good taste.

after that little incident downstairs?

I've only got one bullet in the chamber.

More? I didn't take it the first time.

and I'm sure that every single
guy on this planet

would love to sleep with you, including me.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.712
But I just can't.

I'm in love.

Got to say it again. It's a very nice surprise.

We can do anything we want.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.638
Anything?

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:51.909
Anything.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.353
I like the sound of that.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.714
Is this your room?

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.314
Why, yes, it is, my diminutive goddess.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.355
Good, because we are going to need

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.158
a little bit of privacy.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.152

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.792
That's it, you pathetic slave. Keep doing that.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.035
Don't you think this is
getting a little out of hand?

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.998
Oh, you haven't even seen
"out of hand" yet.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.718
I didn't mean we had to stop.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.270
Oh, we're not stopping.
We're just getting started.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.112
You ready to get kinky?

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.077
Whoa, this isn't kinky yet?

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.399
Not even close.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.112
What is that noise?

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.155

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.713
What the hell?

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.471
You got to be kidding me.

(HORSE SNUFFLING)

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.109
So, you wanna go upstairs?

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.034
Yeah, I do.

Hi, Mr. Sterling. Is Tracy home?

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.876
Hello, Erik. No, she's not.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.992
She's gone to a party
with Brooke and Natalie.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:14.069
Oh.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.918
Okay. Well, sorry to disturb you, then.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.274
Have a good night!

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.432
Crazy little fucker.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.869
We gotta find Tracy. We gotta find Tracy.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.315
We gotta find Tracy.
Where the fuck is Tracy?

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.997
I don't think sex has to be just one-on-one.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.069
(HORSE NEIGHING)

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.593
What the hell?

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.233
Tracy!

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.789
Hey!

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.395
Trace!

What the hell are you doing here?

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.037
And on a horse!

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.151
Where's Tracy? I have to see her.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.879
We think it's best if you just leave her alone.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.359
What? Why?

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.193
Because we know about
your little sorority slut.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.989
- What are you talking about?
- She saw you kiss that girl on TV.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.955
Shit. Wait a second. So what?
I was on a guilt-free pass.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.634
Wake up, Erik. There is no such thing.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.629
Where is Tracy?

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.633
Oh, we gave Tracy a guilt-free pass,
and she's using it right now.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.431
Tracy! Trace!

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.439
Hey, hey. Tracy Sterling.
Have you seen her?

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.557
I think she went upstairs with Trent a little...

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.115
Tracy!

Trace, can you hear me? Are you in there?

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.639
Trace, if you can hear me, I am sorry.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.756
I am really sorry about everything, okay?

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.957
I know you gave me this pass,
but I didn't use it.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.395
I mean I did use it,
but it was only for a few seconds.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.631
I couldn't go through with it,
so I came here looking for you, okay?

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.837
Look, I don't care about the sex.
I really don't.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.239
It's not the most important thing. You are.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.591
Trace, I love you.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.593
Can you hear me? I love you!

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.319
Do you mind? I'm trying to get laid here.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.111
TRACY: You rode
a horse for me?

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.038
When I heard her, I thought...

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.991
I couldn't do it, either.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.998
I love you, too.

I'm telling you, man.
I parked the car right here.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.713
Well, obviously, you didn't,
because then it would be right here.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.032
Where the hell is Erik?

where my underwear is.

Somebody call a taxi?

Where the fuck did you go?

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.189
To get some breakfast.

Oh, completely out of hand, bro.

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.352
Where are the girls?

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.228
They all split this morning. Said they had to
drive to State for some big party.

01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.878
That must make you feel pretty special.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.235
"Special"? Who cares about special?

And, baby, I had plenty. Yeah.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.479
And just how out of hand
was this sex, Cooze?

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.949
I don't wanna talk about it. Ever.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.716
Speaking of which,
did you seal the deal with that Brandy chick?

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.348
No.

I told you. Pay up.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.479
Tracy.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.189
I drove home
in the middle of the night, I ran out of gas,

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.352
stole a horse, rode over to Allison's party...

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.510
- We had sex in the guest room.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.238
- You stole a horse?
- Yup.

A real horse?
Like the kind you ride and shit?

balls for something like that.
