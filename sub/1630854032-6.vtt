WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:11.553
And in Weird Things in Space News,
that mysterious "rift" is still there.

00:11.636 --> 00:12.679
Not gone yet.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.556
You remember that don’t you?
It’s probably important.

00:14.639 --> 00:15.682
Back to you, Tabitha.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.768
Rick, Mom’s working and Dad’s
still sleeping, I’m gonna be late!

00:18.852 --> 00:21.187
Yeah, yeah. I got you, here.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.732
Holy shit.
Is the portal gun working again.

00:23.815 --> 00:24.774
Yeah pretty much.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.278
Sometimes that happens

00:32.198 --> 00:33.158
Just get the keys.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.329
It’s actually been nice taking a break
from the portal travel stuff.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.539
I’ve been racking up a lot of

00:39.622 --> 00:42.125
-high school adventures.
-I have a process, Morty.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.087
I’m fixing my portal gun and every time
you bring it up it blocks my creative flow

00:46.171 --> 00:48.256
and then I’m forced
to take longer on purpose

00:48.339 --> 00:51.426
-just to train you to not bring it up.
-Jeez. Do you know what projection is?

00:51.509 --> 00:54.304
-Do you?
-No. I heard Mom use it.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.808
Lord no! He’s here again?
Morty protocol, children!

01:00.226 --> 01:04.272
What’s it now? Brain Bugs? Space Worms?
Have I been The Facultied again?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.357
You guys don’t have to
react like this every day

01:06.441 --> 01:09.611
Last time the aliens made me lick
all the toilet seats!

01:09.694 --> 01:12.238
That’s right, made me! I see that
look on your faces.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.743
-What did you do, ya tiny monster?
-This isn’t me.

01:24.459 --> 01:28.713
The people demand to know, do these
visitors come in peace? But first.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.548
Peter’s Pizza Corner!

01:30.632 --> 01:33.343
-What slice we reviewing today, Petey?
-Cheese.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.268
If these aliens want Earth,
they’ll have to go through Egypt.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.146
And they can ask mummies how that goes.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.526
Mummy Mia!

01:56.574 --> 02:00.119
-Dinosaurs are back?
-Monkeys went bald?

02:38.658 --> 02:42.579
Before we start, where are the
rest of us?

02:44.497 --> 02:47.250
They died. Long time ago.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.544
Way before us. We didn’t see nothin’.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.673
But surely our ancestors must have left
some evidence behind.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.676
Why is he nervous?

02:58.970 --> 03:02.265
Because, you’re dinosaurs.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.101
It’s weird. Thought you were dead.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.815
Moving on, we, quote, "dinosaurs"
evolved here on Earth

03:10.899 --> 03:13.776
until our technology was
planetarily harmonic.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.821
That being the goal with technology.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.450
After we achieved perfect balance
with Mother Earth,

03:20.533 --> 03:23.411
our best and bravest left
to help other planets.

03:23.494 --> 03:27.749
Over millions of years we’ve called many
worlds home and helped each one flourish.

03:28.291 --> 03:32.420
Imagine our surprise upon returning home
to find our species extinct

03:32.503 --> 03:35.798
and Earth now in the care of... you guys.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.302
When we left,
you were basically squirrels.

03:39.385 --> 03:43.765
Well, we’ve come a long way and
we’ve buried a lot more than nuts!

03:43.848 --> 03:46.392
We’ve evolved past
non-constructive criticism

03:46.476 --> 03:48.561
so let’s agree you’ve done your best.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.648
You’re still alive. But surely
there was some point between

03:51.731 --> 03:52.774
gun powder and

03:53.232 --> 03:55.818
something called Amazon Prime that
you folks had to think,

03:55.902 --> 03:57.487
are we supposed to be running a planet?

03:57.820 --> 03:58.738
Wouldn’t we rather make

03:59.197 --> 04:01.824
"Marvel movies?" How many Marvel
movies have you made?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.618
Twenty-nine and fourteen more on the way.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.789
See you love doing that. And we love
helping new life forms get their footing.

04:07.872 --> 04:11.501
So now that we’re back,
we can respectfully take it from here.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.252
Now hold on. If you’ve seen Endgame,

04:13.336 --> 04:16.130
you know invasion is not something
Earth takes lying down.

04:16.214 --> 04:20.760
This is not an invasion, besides
wouldn’t you like to lie down?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.221
You must be exhausted.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.475
Put your feet up, get more tattoos, finish
rounding out this "Ant Man" character.

04:27.558 --> 04:31.312
Think of it like your Earth concept
of "vacation", except permanent.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.148
I think I speak for all world leaders
when I say that the poor people

04:34.232 --> 04:36.609
would just murder us if we
made you leave, so...

04:38.820 --> 04:40.238
Welcome home. Dinosaurs.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.448
I could use a vacation!

04:42.532 --> 04:44.534
-Should we nuke them?
-I’m on vacation, Curtis.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.369
Well, you leaned into this fast.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.541
Zuniceratops.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.169
Elvisaurus.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.464
Bambiraptor.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.383
Erectopus.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.301
Dracorex.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.220
Hogwartsia.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.807
Gojirasaurus.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.851
Vulcanodon.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.769
Sauroniops.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.857
Phuwiangosaurus.

05:16.190 --> 05:20.570
Those are real dinosaur names.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.536
I can’t even pretend
to feel useful in a game!

05:28.619 --> 05:30.371
This is how humanity’s story ends?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.582
Relieved of duty
and sat at the kid’s table?

05:32.665 --> 05:35.585
I gotta respect these dinosaurs,
they dominated a whole species

05:35.668 --> 05:38.087
just by calling its bluff about
wanting more free time.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.631
They didn’t even dominate us
because we’re not worth a fight to them.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.592
We’ve become biological
Tyler Perry movies.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.677
-All they’ve done is help.
-We didn’t need their help!

05:44.761 --> 05:47.305
We were not the problem!
This house recycles.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.767
They sort it at the trash facility!

05:51.517 --> 05:54.395
WTF! My dance videos
are getting like zero likes now.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.814
The Dinos kicked pedophiles off TikTok.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.441
Great, so now I’m broke?

05:58.524 --> 06:01.819
-You don’t need money anymore.
-So what’s this for now? Phone calls?

06:02.653 --> 06:04.697
-C’mon, Dad, you don’t hate this too?
-Why would I?

06:04.781 --> 06:06.282
I was already doing what I wanted.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.452
I do think it’s kind of funny
that you’re all basically Jerry now.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.454
Fuck.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.166
-Jerry, how do you do it.
-Yeah, Dad, how do you do it?

06:15.249 --> 06:16.459
How do you do it, Dad?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.461
-How do you do it?
-How do you do it?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.213
It’s finally happened.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.814
Alright.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.442
Does anyone know how to
mail things to publishers?

06:42.860 --> 06:45.863
President only pages me
if it’s an emergency or he needs molly.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.370
I’m sure glad you stayed open, Beau.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.206
Wish we could pay, but,
no more capitalism.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.292
I never make ribs for the money,
Mister President.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.795
Here ya go.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.673
That’s not why I called!
Drugs can’t solve this problem.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.299
I can’t live like this anymore.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.678
At first it was fun spending all day
watching whatever YouTube autoplays

07:08.761 --> 07:12.181
after the last one autoplayed, but a man
can only watch so many ads for Grammarly.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.184
Rick. Please!
You’re not bound by morality.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.811
Get rid of them. Slit their necks,

07:16.894 --> 07:20.148
Zero Dark Thirty these fuckers
for the good of the species. I won’t tell!

07:20.231 --> 07:23.276
Help us go back to the old days where
we pretend to fix the problems we caused.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.695
You think I’m gonna side with you
over hyper-intelligent creatures

07:25.778 --> 07:29.365
operating way beyond your comprehension?
I have more in common with them than you.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.827
You pompous autistic cadaver!
You think you’re above this?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.787
-I ought to...
-Look here, Mr. President.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.124
When I need my ribs to be tender
and delicious, I pamper them.

07:38.624 --> 07:42.753
See, if you give someone what they want,
they’ll give you what you need.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.422
Jus’ saying.

07:44.505 --> 07:48.217
I see your point, Beau.
Alright, Rick. Name your price.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.137
-Crap.
-Goddammit!

07:51.220 --> 07:53.514
-How often are you Westworlding me?
-Hang on.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.850
Rib-tips jammed his folk-chip again.

07:55.933 --> 07:59.437
Ol’ Reliable Rick. Always knows
what to do!

07:59.812 --> 08:02.190
-What do you want, Rick?
-I won’t stoop to answering that again.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.524
You know exactly what I want.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.568
I can’t just snap my fingers
and get you that job.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.446
-Yeah yeah. Thanks for lunch.
-Fine. Fine!

08:08.529 --> 08:11.282
If you get rid of the dinosaurs,
you can host the Oscars.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.242
-Yes!
-Righteous Rick!

08:13.326 --> 08:16.829
Straight shootin’, truth tellin’,
never wets the bed.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.710
Goodbye old friends,
may you rest in peace,

08:23.377 --> 08:25.379
rather than the tank of an SUV.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.632
Hello, fellow cosmic voyagers.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.843
-Can we help you?
-Actually, I can probably help you.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.639
See, I’m technically human but I’ve
come to be more, you know, on your level

08:35.139 --> 08:37.433
-We’re fine, thank you.
-Maybe I’m being too indirect.

08:37.516 --> 08:41.187
I happen to dabble in multiversal travel,
and I could probably zap you guys

08:41.270 --> 08:43.814
-to an alternate Earth...
-We used portal travel eons ago

08:43.898 --> 08:48.486
but evolved to a one universe, one truth
policy as the highest form of existence.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.448
Sort of a put your own oxygen mask on
before helping others type of a thing.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.868
-Have you been on a plane?
-Yes, I’ve been on a plane.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.871
We have no problem if you jump dimensions.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.458
Although we sense your gateway device
is sub-optimal. Let us help.

09:02.541 --> 09:05.002
I don’t need help. I’m here to help you.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.172
-What the hell is this?
-A Portal Pistol.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.424
The gateways are see-through,
not a green swirl,

09:10.508 --> 09:12.385
so now you can see where you’re going.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.386
"Clever girl."

09:13.469 --> 09:15.221
If you’d like we could
patch up your little

09:15.304 --> 09:17.348
-inter-dimensional rift too...
-No, leave it,

09:17.431 --> 09:19.392
I know how to close that,
that’s there for a reason.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.519
-Very canonical.
-Don’t you just want it closed?

09:21.602 --> 09:25.815
-Morty, whose team are you on?
-It’s normal to be frustrated. Here.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.567
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.776
-Goodbye.
-No, wait.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.488
What the fuck!

09:32.822 --> 09:34.699
-Dr. Manhattan highroad assholes
-I saw my bones!

09:34.782 --> 09:36.492
-teleporting me?
-Why, wasn’t that painful?

09:36.575 --> 09:38.703
They didn’t even do it right!
My fly is down.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.329
Your fly was already down.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.248
What are you doing with that?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.792
-Rick! It was a better...
-Nothing from them is better!

09:45.126 --> 09:47.545
That thing had uptight
zen snob germs all over it.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.130
So what now you’re gonna fight them?

09:49.213 --> 09:50.506
And prove we’re violent and stupid?

09:50.589 --> 09:52.425
No, we’re gonna find out
what they’re hiding.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.552
Only people who have
really fucked up in the past

09:54.635 --> 09:55.845
have to virtue signal this hard.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.472
-Look at Sean Penn.
-But Rick, aren’t these feelings, like,

09:58.556 --> 10:01.058
what they talked about?
Like life gets,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.520
"programmed for competition
by early stages of evolution,

10:04.603 --> 10:06.856
like, amoebas have to
fight amoebas for energy but

10:07.273 --> 10:10.693
once a species can get enough sugar
from a machine to give itself diabetes,

10:10.776 --> 10:12.862
it’s allowed to start
thinking beyond conflict."

10:12.945 --> 10:14.530
I mean it’s all in their pamphlet.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.785
Morty, you’re a genius. I clearly
mean that in the 90s ironic sense

10:19.869 --> 10:23.205
but this self-fellating 'zine is a
treasure map to every fossilized

10:23.289 --> 10:24.832
bone in their skeleton closet.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.542
They’re gonna call us Laura Dern

10:26.625 --> 10:29.295
because we’re about to get
elbow deep in dino doo doo.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.838
Get it, Morty? The gloves?

10:31.213 --> 10:32.798
-You remember the big gloves?
-Yeah, no. I get it, Rick.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.508
I said "Clever Girl" earlier,

10:34.592 --> 10:35.801
-you didn’t even react.
-I was angry!

10:43.434 --> 10:45.561
I’m looking for a few of my friends.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.732
Kinda look like the Skullfeet that used
to live on our planet way before us.

10:49.815 --> 10:50.775
They’re long gone now.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.235
Really? They’re extinct here too?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.571
Yeah! We keep their bones
in that museum over there.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.784
These guys aren’t gonna be much
help.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.162
The leading theory is the Skullfeet
stepped on their own brains so much

11:03.245 --> 11:05.456
they straight up died. Such a shame.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.583
-Would have loved to hear them sing.
-Sing?

11:07.666 --> 11:10.795
We figured they used to hold huge outdoor
concerts in their land amphitheater.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.589
-You people are idiots.
-We didn’t have much to go by. ==

11:13.673 --> 11:16.425
-Bones aren’t big on conversation.
-Yeah, neither are you, pal.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.888
The majestic Basketsaur! Aren’t they
incredible?

11:20.971 --> 11:23.599
We’re even making a series
of increasingly terrible movies

11:23.682 --> 11:25.434
about cloning them in a theme park!

11:25.518 --> 11:27.812
-So what happened to them?
-No idea.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.607
But we do know they all loved eating
communal soup out of the Great Dirt Bowl.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.776
Starting to see a pattern here.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.320
Breathtaking aren’t they?

11:36.654 --> 11:39.448
It’s a common misconception
that they roamed our planet.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.369
The truth is, they rolled.
Street-style mostly. Some vert.

11:43.452 --> 11:47.373
Lemme guess. There’s a very large,
deep circular indentation in which these

11:47.456 --> 11:49.125
"Grindasaurs" used to shred.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.754
We think they had a second brain in their
butt dedicated to pulling ten eighties.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.716
Three planets visited by dinosaurs,
three apocalyptic meteor impacts.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.843
Gimme the board.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.261
I’m dropping in for data.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.556
Rick! That’s the hardest thing
in skateboarding!

12:03.639 --> 12:06.475
It looked so easy on Pro Skater 3!

12:09.186 --> 12:10.104
Hello.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.482
Jackpot, Morty.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.609
You still think the dinosaurs
got something to hide?

12:15.693 --> 12:18.571
No, Morty, they have a reason to
hide.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.406
-Come here ya little whippersnapper.
-No Rick, stop.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.782
-C’mere Morty! Come on, gimme a hug.
-No, don’t touch me.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.117
-What’s the matter with you?
-Your hands are greasy!

12:23.784 --> 12:26.871
It’s become clear your species
is having a hard time

12:27.246 --> 12:29.748
adjusting to its reduced accountability.

12:29.832 --> 12:33.627
Our solution is to hold these
regular keynotes, or talks,

12:33.711 --> 12:36.130
which you used to launch
new phones and religions.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.257
I see someone’s eager to speak!

12:38.841 --> 12:41.510
Hi, what do you do when
you want to kill yourself?

12:41.886 --> 12:45.598
You don’t do that, thank you
for asking though. Very important.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.392
We recently discovered
a new piece of human literature

12:48.476 --> 12:50.394
that we think
everyone should read.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.481
Holy shit! I’m a famous author!

12:53.898 --> 12:55.483
Wait, where’s my name?

12:55.566 --> 12:58.360
We will distribute it to everyone
on Earth tomorrow.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.447
Excuse me, aren’t you gonna say
who wrote it?

13:01.530 --> 13:04.366
Nope. Whoever wrote it
must be above needing credit.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.786
It’s all here in this book
that belongs to everyone. For free.

13:08.496 --> 13:13.042
You communist lizard scum bags!
I wrote that! Me, Jerry Smith!

13:23.844 --> 13:26.639
Guess what!
Dinosaurs are not secretly evil

13:26.722 --> 13:28.682
and they’re not out
to cause anybody trouble

13:28.766 --> 13:31.393
but it turns out trouble
has a way of following them.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.480
Yes, it’s showtime.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.609
Literally every planet with dinosaurs
on it is eventually smashed by a huge

13:38.692 --> 13:41.320
space rock that takes out
them and most existing life.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.322
What? That can’t be true.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.616
It’s alright to be frustrated.
Let me explain.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.786
Why would planet killing meteors
follow Dinosaurs?

13:49.245 --> 13:53.249
As these reptiles evolved to higher and
higher levels of loving vegan godhood,

13:53.332 --> 13:56.252
another life-form devolved
into an equally selfless,

13:56.335 --> 13:59.213
hate filled species
of barely sentient rocks.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.758
They hurtle through space and do as much
damage as they can to their chosen enemy,

14:02.841 --> 14:04.051
which is guess-who.

14:04.385 --> 14:08.597
Everywhere these dinos go, these rocks,
they come-a crashing. And this one...

14:10.432 --> 14:12.560
is headed directly towards us.

14:13.477 --> 14:17.189
-And all of our work? It was for...
-Nothing, bingo!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.400
Welcome to life, it’s a big boat
with a lot of holes

14:19.483 --> 14:20.568
but we’re all in it together.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.610
Oh my.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.571
So much death.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.284
Congratulations, primates.
Looks like Earth could have done worse!

14:28.367 --> 14:31.787
Rick out! And don’t forget
to tune into this year’s Oscars.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.500
Well, this is a, a lot to take in.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.337
I like trains now!

14:40.879 --> 14:42.590
Okay, that hurt.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.384
Trains rule! Dino’s Drool!

14:46.635 --> 14:50.139
And you had no idea about the disastrous
meteors that followed in your wake?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.851
We just learned about it like you.
Truly heartbreaking news.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.187
But I assume you’re gonna
destroy it when it arrives here, right?

14:57.980 --> 15:02.776
We’re in the process of finding a
solution that um doesn’t involve violence.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.195
Hold on, you’re in the process?

15:06.530 --> 15:09.491
Well there you have it Cooperheads.
An angry species of rock is gonna slamm

15:09.575 --> 15:11.785
into our... sorry, their planet,

15:11.869 --> 15:14.830
and our new planet runners
are weighing whether to let it happen.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.336
I mean no one knows
if the meteor species is even real!

15:20.419 --> 15:22.630
No. It’s very real.
We all know that.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.841
You know what’s real? A rear naked
choke hold. I’ll show you.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.384
What?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.679
Final question, how we doing?

15:31.930 --> 15:36.226
We have come to the conclusion the only
way to ensure humanity will be safe

15:36.310 --> 15:39.104
is for us to go.
We’re leaving the planet for good.

15:42.149 --> 15:46.528
Exxon spilling the oil,
Chernobyl blowing up,

15:46.612 --> 15:52.618
Asbestos in Montana,
Atlantic City, type 2 diabetes,

15:53.160 --> 15:57.081
Deepwater deeply blew it,

15:57.665 --> 15:59.792
giant garbage island,

16:00.417 --> 16:03.295
and all the bees are dying,

16:03.629 --> 16:08.300
fuck off and Dienosaurs.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.393
Maybe it’s the molly,
but I fucking love you, Rick!

16:17.476 --> 16:18.394
It’s the molly.

16:18.477 --> 16:22.272
Isn’t this nice?
Rivalries behind us, dinos gone,

16:22.356 --> 16:23.857
two cool guys living in the moment!

16:24.858 --> 16:28.195
So, like, you know what
you’re gonna wear, because...

16:28.278 --> 16:29.405
I can’t get another plus one.

16:29.488 --> 16:33.283
What?! I’m the one who got you the gig,
you son of a bitch. I feel this napkin.

16:33.367 --> 16:37.121
Feel this napkin. So soft.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.375
This is the 95th annual Academy Awards!

16:41.458 --> 16:43.502
Now, please welcome your host,

16:43.585 --> 16:46.171
an old science guy
who got rid of the dinosaurs

16:46.505 --> 16:48.674
Rick Sanchez!

16:51.593 --> 16:54.096
Suck my grey tits, Hollywood pinkos!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.724
Where’s the mic? The raising mic?

16:58.642 --> 16:59.560
Bring it up!

17:03.480 --> 17:06.275
Tommy! Tom Hanks is here!

17:07.359 --> 17:08.485
C’mon, do it.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.323
Come on. Do it.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.825
Okay okay, one time.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.370
Wilson!

17:19.830 --> 17:21.331
I’m Oscar Host Rick!

17:23.667 --> 17:25.669
Grandpa Rick, this is so cool.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.755
-That microphone bit killed.
-Yeah, told you it would!

17:28.088 --> 17:30.674
-That was all scripted?
-Every moment at the Oscars is.

17:30.758 --> 17:31.759
Even that one thing.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.846
-Look who stole themselves a swag bag!
-Fucking Sprinkles coupon!

17:35.929 --> 17:36.847
We’re splitting that.

17:36.930 --> 17:41.268
So I was thinking it might be funny
to add dinosaurs to the In Memoriam.

17:41.351 --> 17:44.354
It feels beneath us, it’s funnier that
they left and we don’t even care.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.316
Yeah, they left but they keep
begging for attention.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.860
You haven’t heard? The dinos are just
standing up there on Mars

17:50.235 --> 17:52.571
with their dicks in their hands.
So dramatic.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.532
What, they’re just gonna let
the meteor hit them and die?

17:55.616 --> 18:00.204
Good. If being superior to everyone
makes you die, I call that balance.

18:00.287 --> 18:04.666
It’s all in my globally published book
the Dinos stripped my name from!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.169
Oscars are over.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.087
Where are my keys?

18:09.171 --> 18:11.298
Goddammit, I need to fix portal travel!

18:11.381 --> 18:13.425
And I’m going to, I have a process!

18:16.386 --> 18:18.055
Our final act of kindness.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.099
It’s been an honor serving
the sanctity of life with you all.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.152
-Rick, what are you doing?
-Standing here with you guys.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.530
You don’t want to do that.
We’re sacrificing ourselves here.

18:34.863 --> 18:38.659
Then so am I! Y’know? Elon Musk
be damned, we’re blowing up Mars.

18:38.742 --> 18:42.579
No. We’re doing something selfless,
you’re doing it out of pettiness.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.832
How is anyone supposed
to know the difference?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.834
Consider it a game of virtue chicken.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.132
Okay, if you won’t go, we’ll make you go.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.220
Sorry, I dino-proofed my tech
to spite you guys.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.390
Which further proves selflessness and
selfishness are two sides of the same coin

19:01.723 --> 19:03.058
so what’s the point?

19:12.442 --> 19:16.280
Fine. Cool with me that your final chapter
is dying on Mars with an old dick head.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.787
Alright! Welcome back!

19:23.871 --> 19:25.789
You obnoxious little twat!

19:25.873 --> 19:29.418
Yeah but you’re alive!
No David Foster Wallace-ing in my galaxy.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.421
You don’t get to be so smart that
you remove yourself from everybody.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.299
From one god being to another,
you’re welcome.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.509
Well, as long as we’re doing
each other favors.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.721
Wait what are you doing?

19:45.517 --> 19:48.186
You fixed my Rift?!
You fucking hypocritical cocks!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.563
It was all canonical and shit!

19:49.646 --> 19:51.481
We coulda milked that thing
for a whole season.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.234
Or like a three episode arc at least!

19:54.318 --> 19:58.572
Sorry. That’s just us. We love helping,
god beings to god being.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.450
Seriously! I was gonna fix that!

20:06.914 --> 20:07.873
Shit. They’re coming back!

20:09.207 --> 20:12.252
Can we turn on the AC? It’s like
a thousand degrees outside!

20:13.337 --> 20:15.422
Yes! New follower! Named...

20:15.756 --> 20:17.633
Crypto_For_Bare_Toes

20:17.716 --> 20:19.801
Not sure I get it
but sounds like business!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.762
-Proud of you, honey.
-Is Dad okay?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.806
Yes, I’m just writing my second book.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.601
I don’t know what it’s gonna be about,
but I can tell you one thing

20:27.684 --> 20:31.438
the title is "Jerry Smith Presents:
A Book By Jerry Smith."

20:32.564 --> 20:33.482
Chapter one.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.487
Fuck!

20:40.322 --> 20:41.907
Morty, get your ass in the garage.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.916
Check it out. A dimension where
hats wear people.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.753
I did it, I fixed portal travel!

20:55.462 --> 20:57.839
-Oh shit!
-Figured my guy deserves a vacation.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.676
-Boob world!
-You’re damn right. And it’s Areola Week.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.513
-Alright! Good old fashioned portal fun!
-Yep, like this!

21:05.597 --> 21:08.058
-It’s gonna be classic episodes, Morty!
-I’m gonna puke, Rick!

21:08.141 --> 21:10.519
Portaling in! Wrecking shit,
portaling out, Morty.

21:10.602 --> 21:14.523
Oh my god, adventures, Morty!
Social commentary! Crude characters!

21:14.606 --> 21:16.566
Here we go! Rick and Morty time!

21:49.474 --> 21:50.767
This is our home now.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.853
We shall live out the rest
of our days here.

21:52.936 --> 21:55.731
Never interfering with the ways
of the universe again.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.857
We are content.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.442
It was a good run.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.485
Speaking of a good run.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.821
I bet I could switch heel onto that
manny pad, big spin out,

22:02.904 --> 22:05.407
Tre flip that gap, 5-0 the rail,
drop into the bowl,

22:05.490 --> 22:07.826
stale fish into a Christ air
and then we get fucking wrecked.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.745
It’s on, Iguanadon.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.539
Grinding some rocks.
Nollie the hubba.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.751
Goofyfoot, kickflip,
take care of the Groms.

22:15.834 --> 22:20.422
But you’re a bad little dino boy
and you’re rotting in a crater.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.798
So now let’s make some noise.
