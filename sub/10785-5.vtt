YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET UPSET AT ME.

34:20.917 --> 34:23.291
OH! I AM NOT
UPSET, CHILD.

34:23.291 --> 34:25.291
I AM SICK.

34:25.291 --> 34:28.125
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO SLIDE BACK

34:28.125 --> 34:29.917
INTO YOUR REPREHENSIBLE
NEW YORK BEHAVIOR.

34:29.917 --> 34:33.833
NOT WHILE YOU'RE
UNDER MY CARE.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.458
YOU WILL NOT
DISRESPECT ME.

34:35.458 --> 34:36.833
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S NOT--

34:36.833 --> 34:38.208
NO, YOU WAIT A MINUTE,
JENNIFER!

34:38.208 --> 34:40.208
THIS BEHAVIOR
WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.250
YOU WILL TREAT ME
WITH RESPECT,

34:42.250 --> 34:43.958
AND YOU WILL
ACT LIKE A LADY.

34:43.958 --> 34:46.583
YOU WILL NOT
DEGRADE YOURSELF.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.333
NOT UNDER MY ROOF
AND NOT IN MY LIFETIME.

34:53.583 --> 34:57.041
HAVE YOU NO RESPECT
FOR YOURSELF?

35:21.250 --> 35:24.041
DAWSON. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

35:24.041 --> 35:25.333
I HAD TO GET OUT
OF THAT HOUSE.

35:29.625 --> 35:30.834
HEY, JACK.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.667
HEY.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.583
HEY, UH, JOEY,
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,

35:34.583 --> 35:36.792
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE OFF?
I'LL FINISH UP.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.792
OK.

35:56.041 --> 35:58.959
COLUMBIA HAD JUST
BEATEN CORNELL.

35:58.959 --> 36:01.625
IT WAS HOMECOMING
ALMOST EXACTLY
A YEAR AGO.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.959
AND DAD HAD HAD
ONE TOO MANY
TAILGATE MARTINIS,

36:04.959 --> 36:08.792
SO MOM WAS DRIVING.

36:08.792 --> 36:12.333
JACK AND I
WERE FIGHTING FOR
TIM'S ATTENTION.

36:12.333 --> 36:16.250
WE WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING
FOR HIS ATTENTION.

36:17.291 --> 36:21.834
AND, UM, SHE DIDN'T
SEE THE TRUCK.

36:25.333 --> 36:28.583
PLEASE DON'T
SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE, PACEY,

36:28.583 --> 36:31.041
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
MY MOM TO BECOME
THE TOWN GOSSIP.

36:31.041 --> 36:33.458
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

36:36.667 --> 36:37.834
IS YOUR MOTHER
GETTING ANY HELP?

36:37.834 --> 36:40.250
WE'VE TRIED.

36:40.250 --> 36:43.166
SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

36:43.166 --> 36:46.166
DAD KIND OF BAILED,
AND, UM...

36:46.166 --> 36:48.375
HE CHECKS IN
ONCE A WEEK.

36:48.375 --> 36:52.333
UM...
HE LIVES IN PROVIDENCE
WITH THE BUSINESS,

36:52.333 --> 36:52.959
WHICH IS GOING UNDER,

36:52.959 --> 36:55.542
SO HE'S HURTING, TOO.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.041
SO IT'S BASICALLY
JUST ME.

36:59.041 --> 37:03.208
I MEAN, JACK HELPS,
YOU KNOW, SOME, BUT...

37:03.208 --> 37:05.208
HE KIND OF LIVES
IN THIS FANTASY WORLD

37:05.208 --> 37:09.000
WHERE IF YOU DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT,

37:09.000 --> 37:12.208
THEN IT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.250
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

37:14.250 --> 37:17.250
I MEAN,
SOMETIMES SHE'S FINE.

37:17.250 --> 37:18.417
BUT YOU JUST NEVER KNOW,

37:18.417 --> 37:22.417
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN HANDLE HER.

37:22.417 --> 37:26.542
AND SOMETIMES THAT JUST
GETS REALLY HARD.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.375
COME HERE.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.375
COME HERE.

37:31.375 --> 37:31.959
NO.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.250
DON'T PITY ME, OK?

37:34.250 --> 37:35.959
ANDIE, IT'S NOT PITY.

37:35.959 --> 37:36.750
COME HERE.
NO.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.583
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.708
IT'S OK.

37:44.708 --> 37:47.375
IT'S OK.

38:09.125 --> 38:11.041
YOU WERE SO RIGHT
ABOUT THAT MOON.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.166
YEAH?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.458
HEY, CAN WE JUST...

38:15.458 --> 38:17.667
SIT OUTSIDE
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?

38:17.667 --> 38:19.125
ARE YOU OK?

38:19.125 --> 38:20.291
YOU SEEM
A LITTLE SPOOKED.

38:20.291 --> 38:23.000
I JUST--
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
IN THAT HOUSE.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.917
IT'S LIKE
THE HOUSE OF DESPAIR.

38:29.458 --> 38:32.125
DAWSON, UM...

38:33.041 --> 38:36.208
I HAD A REALLY WEIRD
NIGHT, TOO. I--

38:36.208 --> 38:37.875
YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST
FORGET ABOUT...EVERYTHING.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.041
OKAY?

38:39.041 --> 38:41.500
ALL I WANT TO DO...

38:41.500 --> 38:44.667
FOR THE REST OF THIS
GODFORSAKEN NIGHT

38:44.667 --> 38:46.250
IS JUST STARE AT YOUR FACE
IN THE MOONLIGHT,

38:46.250 --> 38:48.583
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO ME.

39:11.625 --> 39:12.458
HEY, LOOK UP IN THE SKY.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.667
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

39:20.792 --> 39:22.291
THE MOON.

39:22.291 --> 39:25.125
NO, NO. LOOK AT--
LOOK AT THE MOON...

39:25.125 --> 39:27.041
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.

39:30.375 --> 39:32.041
NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE?

39:35.792 --> 39:37.417
IT'S THE MAN.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.041
WHO?

39:40.041 --> 39:41.750
THE MAN, REMEMBER?

39:42.917 --> 39:45.583
OH, RIGHT,
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.542
THE MAN IN THE MOON.
I GET IT.

39:47.542 --> 39:48.125
I GET IT.

39:48.125 --> 39:50.166
OH, BUT WAIT.

39:50.166 --> 39:51.041
WHAT?

39:51.041 --> 39:53.333
IT'S NOT A MAN,
DAWSON.

39:54.750 --> 39:56.834
IT'S A WOMAN.

40:04.333 --> 40:05.458
DAWSON.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.125
WHAT?

40:07.125 --> 40:09.708
LOOK, I...

40:15.041 --> 40:17.708
THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.250
IT'S A...

40:20.250 --> 40:22.500
IT'S A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL MOON.

40:38.333 --> 40:40.959
OUR GUESTS
HAVE JUMPED SHIP.

40:49.375 --> 40:51.417
IT'S TIME, MITCH.

40:53.583 --> 40:56.083
I KNOW.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.125
SO...

40:58.125 --> 40:59.500
DO YOU WANT ME TO...

41:03.125 --> 41:05.542
I'LL GO.
