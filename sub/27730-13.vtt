00:08.965 --> 00:10.836
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:11.881 --> 00:13.013
TILLY:
Who the hell are you?

00:13.056 --> 00:14.014
What's your name?

00:14.057 --> 00:15.711
Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.148
I ran away
because I wasn't ready.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.542
Supposed to become...The queen. Okay.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.631
Let's get you home.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.850
L'RELL:
Boreth is not
for the faint of heart.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.331
No Klingon,
let alone a human,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.420
has ever taken a time crystal
from the monastery

00:29.464 --> 00:32.293
without great sacrifice.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.860
TENAVIK:
A warning, Captain,
the present

00:34.904 --> 00:38.212
is a veil between
anticipation and horror.

00:42.303 --> 00:46.133
You may still choose to walk
away from this future.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.398
But if you take the crystal,
your fate

00:50.441 --> 00:52.574
will be sealed forever.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.619
BURNHAM:
Every Section 31 ship
is required to check in

00:54.663 --> 00:57.013
on an hourly basis,
but this ship checked in

00:57.057 --> 00:59.015
ten minutes past its hour.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.931
You're not Gant.Gant expired with
the rest of the crew.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.411
You are the most
effective tool

01:03.454 --> 01:05.674
to acquire the Sphere archive
from the Discovery.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.683
BURNHAM:
Control isn't just contained
to Leland anymore.

01:14.726 --> 01:15.988
It has the ability
to co-opt people

01:16.032 --> 01:17.860
and entire ships
without being detected.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.775
I'll alert Starfleet as to...Captain?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.255
That's a Section 31 ship.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.518
SPOCK:
They are all
Section 31 ships.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.041
We're outgunned.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.738
We can't delete the data.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.349
That leaves us only one option.

01:28.392 --> 01:29.567
We destroy the ship.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.221
PIKE:
Owosekun,
send a ship-wide alert:

01:31.265 --> 01:33.093
we are evacuating Discovery.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.621
Michael.

02:28.060 --> 02:32.021
BURNHAM:
Personal log, stardate 1051.8.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.805
Thank you.You got it.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.025
BURNHAM:
We're in the process
of abandoning our ship

02:36.068 --> 02:38.593
in order to destroy it.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.732
This is actually happening,
yet somehow

02:47.776 --> 02:50.213
I still can't believe it.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.308
Long-range sensors show
Control is on the move

02:58.352 --> 03:00.528
and gaining quickly.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.747
It's infiltrated
our subspace radio relays,

03:02.791 --> 03:05.533
so we can't reach Starfleet
for backup.

03:05.576 --> 03:08.797
Ship-to-ship communication
is all we've got.

03:08.840 --> 03:14.629
Discoveryto Enterprise,
we're at 20, 15,

03:14.672 --> 03:17.284
ten, nine,

03:17.327 --> 03:19.764
eight...

03:20.809 --> 03:24.813
...seven, six, five...

03:24.856 --> 03:26.858
Engaging reverse thrusters.

03:26.902 --> 03:30.862
Three... two...

03:30.906 --> 03:33.822
Docking sequence initiated.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.998
Evacuation corridors deploying.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.708
Bridge is five by,
and hold for airlock breach.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.028
BURNHAM:
Discovery contains the one thing
in all the galaxy

04:06.071 --> 04:10.946
that Control needs, the data
to become fully conscious.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.995
My mother sacrificed everything to stop Control

04:17.039 --> 04:19.476
from getting that data,

04:19.519 --> 04:22.740
and now she's counting on us
to finish the job.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.528
But is this really
the only solution?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.188
I look in the mirror

04:36.232 --> 04:39.148
and can hardly recognize
myself anymore.

04:42.847 --> 04:46.068
All of these questions
without answers.

04:48.331 --> 04:53.249
There are seven signals,
but we've only seen four.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.774
We have a time crystal
that we don't know how to use.

04:59.647 --> 05:02.214
Captain Pike has always had
faith that they play a part

05:02.258 --> 05:04.260
in some grand design.

05:08.395 --> 05:12.442
Now... more than ever...

05:12.486 --> 05:14.618
I wish I had his certainty.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.406
Burnham, let's move.
The ship's almost clear.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.277
It's time to get the crystal
over to Enterprise.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.366
The signal led us to Boreth
for this. Why?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.760
My mother's gone,
the suit's destroyed,

05:25.803 --> 05:27.762
Now Discovery.

05:27.805 --> 05:30.373
It can't just be
about endings, can it?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.723
We can figure it out, Commander,
but only if we're walking.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.943
I cannot let everything
my mother sacrificed for

05:34.986 --> 05:36.901
be for nothing.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.383
Sometimes

05:40.427 --> 05:43.908
we know the role we're meant
to play, sometimes we don't.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.171
I'm not sure which is better,
to be honest.

05:46.215 --> 05:49.740
And we don't know if we'll have
the strength, do we?

05:49.784 --> 05:52.395
Until the moment comes.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.397
SARU:
Final crew are departing,
Captain.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.138
We should proceed.Understood, Mr. Saru.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.140
You got that?Yes, sir.

06:23.948 --> 06:26.298
RHYS:
Shields unable
to absorb full impact!

06:29.171 --> 06:30.477
LELAND:
Goodbye.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.798
COMPUTER:
Remote auto-destruct enabled.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.853
Life support, environmental
controls, and gravity generators

06:58.896 --> 07:00.985
will deactivate
in five minutes.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.684
All Discoverycrew is accounted
for on the Enterprise,Captain.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.337
Field generators disengaged?Affirmative.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.165
Shields are also off-line,
and the warp core

07:07.209 --> 07:08.602
has been prepared
for overload.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.951
Have we forgotten anything?

07:09.994 --> 07:11.518
There will be
no half measures, sir.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.824
She will go with the dignity
she deserves.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.522
Commander.

07:26.663 --> 07:27.969
PIKE:
Deck one.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.323
You brought
Siranna's knife.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.672
My sister would not
be pleased to hear

07:35.716 --> 07:36.934
that I had left it behind.

07:36.978 --> 07:40.808
And it gives me hope
that we will endure.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.249
MAN:
Captain on the bridge.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.384
She's all yours, Chris.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.604
She looks as good as I remember.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.742
Welcome home, Captain.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.570
Good to be back.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.615
Wish it were
under better circumstances.

08:05.659 --> 08:06.834
Don't we all.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.836
All major systems
are back online,

08:08.879 --> 08:12.535
and we'll have no more
holographic communications...

08:12.579 --> 08:13.536
ever.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.885
Probably for the best.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.366
Lieutenant Amin,
status update.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.368
Sensors show
Leland and his armada

08:19.411 --> 08:20.630
are picking up speed, Captain.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.154
Captain Georgiou
has just arrived, sir.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.286
Permission to
come aboard?

08:24.329 --> 08:26.114
PIKE:
Granted. Have her come on up.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.290
Number One, take us
to a safe distance, please.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.334
Aye, Captain.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.173
Captain Georgiou,
welcome to the Enterprise.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.525
Orange? Really? Ugh.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.267
Your report
on Specialist Gant

08:49.311 --> 08:51.574
was rather enlightening.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.662
Nanobots.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.316
Yes. Now is not the time.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.579
Nonsense. It's good
to get a little distance

08:56.623 --> 08:58.450
from something you love.

08:58.494 --> 09:01.758
On the other hand, I look
forward to hunting Leland down

09:01.802 --> 09:03.978
to the ends of the galaxy
so I can watch

09:04.021 --> 09:10.027
every piece of technology
exit his skin bit by bit.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.812
Leland didn't deserve
what he got.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.771
Better him than me. Or you.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.338
NUMBER ONE:
We're at distance, sir.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.209
All right, everyone. Eyes front.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.867
We'll never see
another like her.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.787
Initiate remote auto-destruct.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.182
COMPUTER:
Auto-destruct initiated.

09:34.225 --> 09:38.578
Counting down. Five, four,

09:38.621 --> 09:41.145
three, two,

09:41.189 --> 09:42.582
one.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.802
Detonation.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.544
Auto-destruct failure.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.243
That is not possible.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.984
Arm photon torpedoes.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.857
Photon torpedoes ready.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.600
Fire.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.695
NUMBER ONE:
Captain, Discovery's
shields are up.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.218
What the hell?Again.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.792
Analysis.SPOCK: Given recent events,
I believe the Sphere data

10:18.835 --> 10:21.272
may be the cause.It's protecting itself.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.058
We tried to delete the data;
it wouldn't let us.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.147
If the data has merged with
Discovery,that would explain

10:26.190 --> 10:28.149
its ability to use
Discovery'sresources

10:28.192 --> 10:30.455
to ensure its survival.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.110
Are you saying we won't be
able to destroy the ship?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.896
NUMBER ONE :
Leland's ships are now in range,

10:35.939 --> 10:37.201
Captain.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.783
OWOSEKUN:
An undetonated photon torpedo

10:53.827 --> 10:56.525
is lodged in Enterprise'shull,

10:56.568 --> 10:59.093
deck five,
section two.
Magnify.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.056
We've lost shields!

11:17.502 --> 11:19.330
Commander, we've been boarded.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.551
Aah!

12:17.780 --> 12:19.216
Goodbye.Aah!

12:20.217 --> 12:22.829
That is not possible.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.526
Arm photon torpedoes.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.832
Photon torpedoes ready.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.399
Stop!

12:31.881 --> 12:34.754
Excuse me, Captain.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.539
It won't work.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.149
PIKE:
What do you mean?

12:39.193 --> 12:41.586
The Sphere's data has already
merged with Discovery.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.066
We should have anticipated
it would use our ship

12:43.110 --> 12:44.285
and our shields

12:44.328 --> 12:46.940
to protect itself,
like it's always done.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.550
You sound rather certain.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.334
I am.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.644
How long until
Leland gets here?

12:55.687 --> 12:57.733
An hour. Maybe less.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.953
Options.We know we can't delete
the data.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.737
Nor, it seems,
can we destroy Discovery.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.740
Even if you jump away,
Control will not stop coming.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.090
Eventually Leland,
or some version of him,

13:07.134 --> 13:09.397
would find you.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.921
Ergo, Discovery'svery existence
is the problem.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.837
Of course.

13:14.881 --> 13:19.146
As long as Discovery
exists here and now,

13:19.189 --> 13:20.669
this will never be over.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.062
You are proposing

13:22.105 --> 13:24.281
we remove Discovery
from the galactic equation

13:24.325 --> 13:26.022
entirely?

13:26.066 --> 13:27.850
How, exactly, are we
supposed to do that?

13:27.894 --> 13:29.765
The crystal.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.723
This is why we have it.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.814
To take the data out
of this time

13:34.857 --> 13:37.381
so Control can never get it.

13:37.425 --> 13:40.384
Discoveryhas to go
to the future.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.955
PIKE:
How do we getDiscovery
to the future

15:12.999 --> 15:15.044
before Leland catches up
with us?

15:15.088 --> 15:16.959
CORNWELL:
Dr. Burnham's suit
was destroyed on Essof IV.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.831
That was the only method
of time travel we know of.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.398
SARU:
We have the technical designs

15:21.442 --> 15:22.704
from Section 31.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.184
We can attempt to rebuild it.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.708
Do it. To my physical
specifications, please.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.405
STAMETS:
That's not possible, sir.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.755
The suit was tailored
to Dr. Burnham's DNA.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.976
Which makes my MRNA
the closest genetic match.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.935
I'll do it.

15:35.978 --> 15:40.243
My mother started this.
I'm gonna finish it.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.376
Even if we could adapt
the code to your biology,

15:42.419 --> 15:45.553
the exoskeleton is made
from a composite alloy

15:45.596 --> 15:46.989
that we can't synthesize.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.209
Well, the alloy is
tritanium-based.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.645
It might be possible
to melt down

15:50.688 --> 15:52.821
part of a cargo bulkhead
to cast a mold.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.257
Not to sweat the details,

15:54.301 --> 15:55.998
but do you even know how
to fly the thing?

15:56.042 --> 15:57.826
I learned the basics
from her logs.

15:57.869 --> 15:58.914
I'm sure there'll be
some trial and error

15:58.958 --> 16:00.176
opening the wormhole.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.961
If Discoverywere
on autopilot,

16:02.004 --> 16:03.179
it could follow you through.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.702
How will you find
your way back?

16:09.272 --> 16:11.405
Everything we know
about the signals

16:11.448 --> 16:14.495
suggests they're indicative
of a design.

16:14.538 --> 16:15.975
I'm willing to trust that.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.716
Are you saying you believe

16:18.760 --> 16:21.806
that another signal
will just reveal itself

16:21.850 --> 16:23.765
because we need it to?

16:23.808 --> 16:25.680
These signals could
only have been set

16:25.723 --> 16:27.551
by an individual
with access to a time suit

16:27.595 --> 16:30.032
and knowledge of our
specific circumstances.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.903
We believed your mother was
the only Red Angel.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.384
However, the bioneural signature
identified another.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.387
You. Her efforts
were focused entirely

16:37.431 --> 16:38.780
on the Sphere data.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.304
She stated that she did not
set the signals.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.176
Therefore, you did.

16:44.742 --> 16:45.961
But if it was me, why?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.789
What am I trying
to lead us to?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.138
That remains to be seen.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.357
But I agree with
Captain Pike.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.360
There is intention
to your design.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.495
I'll have our engineering team
start the fabrication process.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.931
SARU:
And the time crystal.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.759
There is still the matter
of activating it.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.328
My parents used
a stellar-lensing array.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.069
If we can locate
an unstable red giant...

17:07.113 --> 17:08.288
NUMBER ONE:
The odds of finding one

17:08.330 --> 17:09.680
in any given sector
are pretty high.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.682
STAMETS:
But pretty low of finding one

17:11.726 --> 17:14.685
in a supernova state
specifically.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.644
It can take hundreds of years.

17:16.686 --> 17:18.993
So pick a nova and fire
an antimatter missile

17:19.038 --> 17:20.517
into its core.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.911
We would be directly responsible
for destroying

17:22.954 --> 17:25.869
all life within dozens of
light-years, if not more.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.568
Yeah.Uh...

17:27.611 --> 17:28.569
We're not doing that.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.788
I thought there were
no bad ideas.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.268
That's a lie.That's a bad one.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.965
NICOLA:
Admiral, Captain Pike,

17:34.009 --> 17:36.446
there's something
you need to see.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.060
And then there were five.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.066
Do we have a lock
on the signal?

17:47.109 --> 17:48.197
Still working on it.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.633
MANN:
Sensors show Captain Leland--

17:49.677 --> 17:51.635
Control-- is five minutes out.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.942
Red alert.

17:53.985 --> 17:54.943
Mr. Saru,
we'll return to Discovery

17:54.986 --> 17:56.379
with all essential personnel.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.860
Commander Stamets, you will
jump us to that signal.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.601
Yes, Captain.Copy that.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.820
I'll get Enterpriseto the
signal as fast as possible.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.083
I'll join you.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.649
Have any personnel
not directly involved

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
with fabricating
the time suit start

18:07.260 --> 18:09.479
retrofitting all shuttles
and pods for combat operations.

18:09.523 --> 18:10.872
You should do the same.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.048
It'll be us against
whatever Leland's bringing.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.877
Actually, our odds might be
a little better than that.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.922
I took the liberty
of retrofitting our shuttle

18:17.966 --> 18:20.186
and landing pod complement
with enhanced phasers,

18:20.229 --> 18:22.666
and I commandeered the new
experimental tactical flyers,

18:22.710 --> 18:25.408
assuming the shit
would hit the fan.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.627
Well done, Number One.

18:26.670 --> 18:27.671
Godspeed, Captain.

18:27.715 --> 18:28.716
You, too, Admiral.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.152
We'll rendezvous
at the fifth signal.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.787
PIKE:
And where has the signal
led us now?

18:56.831 --> 18:59.007
Class M planet-- Xahea.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.617
Really? Xahea?

19:00.661 --> 19:01.662
Wait, for real?

19:02.619 --> 19:04.143
What do you know, Ensign?

19:04.186 --> 19:06.841
The queen.The queen?

19:06.884 --> 19:09.626
Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I-I-I know the queen of Xahea.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.715
We share a love of engineering.

19:11.759 --> 19:12.803
And what might
Xahea have to do

19:12.847 --> 19:14.414
with powering the time crystal?

19:14.457 --> 19:17.678
Well, Xahea's remarkable for
its natural dilithium supply.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.202
And its queen,
Her Serene Highness

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po...

19:22.030 --> 19:24.859
or-or Po for short,
she, uh, she's only 17,

19:24.902 --> 19:27.949
but she developed a technology
to recrystallize it.

19:27.992 --> 19:31.257
To recrystallize
dilithium?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.736
Well, if true, Starfleet
would no longer

19:32.780 --> 19:35.391
need to seek new sources
of dilithium for its warp cores.

19:35.435 --> 19:39.569
She's brilliant... but she won't
tell anyone how she did it.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.658
She-she doesn't trust anyone
with that information.

19:41.702 --> 19:45.836
So, besides being brilliant,
she's also prudent.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.838
Mr. Bryce, open a channel.Yes, sir.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.363
Let's see if Ensign Tilly
can convince

19:50.406 --> 19:51.581
Her Serene Highness
to help us figure out

19:51.625 --> 19:53.017
why the signal brought us here.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.497
I think she'll be
intrigued, sir,

19:54.541 --> 19:55.716
and probably happy she doesn't
have to stuff herself

19:55.759 --> 19:56.934
into a cargo pallet.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.936
What?

19:58.980 --> 20:00.373
Hmm? Nothing.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.465
Reset the cube and
don't forget to purge

20:05.508 --> 20:06.988
the secondary EPS relay.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.468
Yes, sir.Quickly, quickly.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.558
We have shuttles
and pods to retrofit.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.479
Are you all right?

20:20.958 --> 20:22.351
From the jump.

20:22.395 --> 20:25.833
I-I'm fine... thank you.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.881
Listen...
Listen...

20:30.925 --> 20:32.405
You go.

20:32.448 --> 20:37.366
Um... once Commander Burnham

20:37.410 --> 20:42.328
takes this ship to
wherever she's going...

20:42.371 --> 20:45.200
I'm thinking
I might take a break

20:45.244 --> 20:46.941
from starships.

20:46.984 --> 20:50.640
I passed up a job at
the Vulcan Science Academy

20:50.684 --> 20:52.990
a few months ago.

20:53.034 --> 20:59.083
Or maybe I'll just... live
on a station for a while.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.955
I don't know.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.784
Forward motion.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.222
I get it.

21:09.790 --> 21:13.794
I thought a lot about it,
and... you were right.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.710
If I can take anything

21:16.753 --> 21:20.844
from all this,

21:20.888 --> 21:25.022
it's that forward motion...

21:25.066 --> 21:29.244
is the most honest choice...

21:29.288 --> 21:31.290
for both of us.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.904
Thank you for saying that.

21:36.947 --> 21:40.124
I hope that...

21:40.168 --> 21:42.431
whatever life
you find from here,

21:42.475 --> 21:44.520
whoever you find it with...

21:45.565 --> 21:48.350
...that you're happy, Hugh.

21:48.394 --> 21:51.745
You, too, Paul.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.794
Once the Enterprise
catches up with us...

21:59.492 --> 22:01.929
...I'll be joining them.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.322
Of course.

22:06.499 --> 22:11.330
I need to see how the...
fabrication team is doing

22:11.373 --> 22:12.548
with the suit.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.248
Ice cream is the last thing
I was expecting.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.729
Oh, she's all about sugar.
You have no idea.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.999
Your Serene Highness, may I...

22:29.043 --> 22:30.000
Tilly!

22:36.616 --> 22:39.140
Is that spumoni?

22:42.622 --> 22:44.972
My calculations for
small-particle dispersion

22:45.015 --> 22:47.191
in hydrogenated carbohydrates
were so on point.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.498
But I just end up with goo.

22:49.542 --> 22:50.717
Fascinating.

22:50.760 --> 22:51.718
Po, this is

22:51.761 --> 22:52.980
Commander Michael Burnham.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.198
Your roomie.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.810
You look taller
in your photos.

22:56.853 --> 22:59.116
Thank you...

22:59.160 --> 23:01.336
And this is Captain Pike.
This is the captain.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.208
Your Highness,
Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.733
Wow, you're good.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.126
Po's fine.
Thank you.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.824
Can you eat and walk?
I'll fill you in on the way.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.260
Mm-hmm.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.435
So, you have a time crystal,

23:13.479 --> 23:14.915
which I've only
ever read about,

23:14.958 --> 23:16.786
and no method by which
to activate it.

23:16.830 --> 23:19.180
And you have a time suit.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.399
Which genius built that?

23:21.617 --> 23:22.618
My mom.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.186
Hmm. I had a special mom, too.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.231
Ugh.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.277
So you want
to use the suit

23:29.320 --> 23:31.410
to travel through time

23:31.453 --> 23:33.194
with this ship
flying behind you, yes?
Yes.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.065
And then you want
to cut the ship loose

23:35.109 --> 23:36.850
and come back alone?

23:37.677 --> 23:39.243
Hmm.
GEORGIOU:
This endeavor would be

23:39.287 --> 23:41.811
rather ridiculous
if Michael intended

23:41.855 --> 23:43.596
to return with the ship.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.206
One of the fun things
about becoming queen

23:45.249 --> 23:46.555
of the most
politically relevant

23:46.599 --> 23:48.775
planet in the galaxy
is that

23:48.818 --> 23:50.777
I don't have to listen
to any snark.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.432
I made it an actual law.What?

23:53.475 --> 23:55.912
Oh, uh, we believe
that there'sUgh.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.784
a reason the signal
brought us to your planet.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.267
What's happening?

24:05.313 --> 24:07.228
It's nuclear particle physics.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.795
Pretty sure
she's calculating

24:08.838 --> 24:11.145
the reaction rate
between particles.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.668
E = mc squared stuff.

24:12.712 --> 24:13.756
I like you.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.497
I like you, too.GEORGIOU:
Good.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.890
We're friends now.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.587
The goop in this bowl
is vile.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.850
I can modify
my dilithium incubator

24:20.894 --> 24:22.722
to trigger an ongoing
cascade of energy

24:22.765 --> 24:24.245
within the crystal
by combining it

24:24.288 --> 24:25.551
with dark energy.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.336
It'll replicate the power
of a supernova.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.599
And charge your crystal.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.601
I get to make a supernova.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.821
Today rocks.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.518
I will need
energy, though.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.780
Like, Planck-level.

24:37.824 --> 24:38.694
RENO:
That's a little more
than the EPS grid

24:38.738 --> 24:40.174
normally allows.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.654
We could pull from
the spore drive.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.570
It would take 12 hours
for the spore drive to recover.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.702
How are we supposed to fight
off dozens of enemy ships

24:46.746 --> 24:48.835
without being able
to jump away?

24:48.878 --> 24:51.402
We'd be going into battle
without our spore drive.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.317
If that's what it takes
to power the suit,

24:53.361 --> 24:54.754
we'll have
to make it work.Good.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.277
There is just one problem.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.454
Certain death in battle
wasn't enough of a problem?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.021
RENO:
This is bigger.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.240
Charging the crystal this way
is like using a waterfall

25:03.284 --> 25:04.546
to get a drink of water.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.157
It'll work, but then you drown.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.290
I don't... follow.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.291
I believe
what they wish to convey

25:10.334 --> 25:11.684
is that continuous regeneration

25:11.727 --> 25:13.337
of energy will
ultimately overwhelm

25:13.381 --> 25:15.339
the structural integrity
of the crystal.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.863
Causing it to burn out.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.779
BURNHAM:
Meaning, I can take Discovery

25:19.822 --> 25:21.824
to the future.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.959
But I won't be able
to come back.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.432
It's a one-way trip.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.695
You're leaving? Forever?

26:08.131 --> 26:09.611
SPOCK:
That is correct.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.004
To ensure the
Sphere data remains

26:11.047 --> 26:12.483
out of Leland's reach,

26:12.527 --> 26:15.443
Michael must remain
in the future.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.358
Permanently.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.969
What does that even mean?

26:21.014 --> 26:22.624
Where in the future?

26:22.668 --> 26:25.018
Assuming I don't get lost
in the wormhole,

26:25.061 --> 26:27.107
in theory,

26:27.150 --> 26:28.848
my mother should have returned

26:28.891 --> 26:31.154
to her anchor point
on Terralysium.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.678
So hopefully I will
land there, too.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.680
And there's no
technology there,

26:34.723 --> 26:36.551
so Discoverywill be safe.TYLER:
"In theory"?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.859
"Hopefully"? Michael, you could
land anywhere in any time.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.164
We are aware.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.644
BURNHAM:
Apparently,

26:42.688 --> 26:44.428
this is what
I'm meant to do.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.649
Trust the mystery.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.433
Are you sure there's
no other way?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.174
If there were, we
would have found it.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.655
Commander Burnham will use
the suit to open a wormhole.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.744
Discoverywill be on
autopilot behind her.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.311
Our job is to clear a path.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.661
Anything in
the vicinity will be

26:59.705 --> 27:01.358
either destroyed
or pulled into the future

27:01.402 --> 27:02.969
with her,
and we cannot risk that.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.188
This is crazy.
We have a spore drive.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.364
Sorry, lovebug,
we don't.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.018
STAMETS:
We need the power to
charge the crystal.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.454
It won't be
up and running again

27:10.498 --> 27:12.108
until long after
Michael's gone.

27:12.152 --> 27:15.982
Captain, the Enterprise
will arrive in 57 minutes.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.853
Control is only ten minutes
behind them.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.246
PIKE:
All right.

27:19.289 --> 27:21.857
This is what you've trained for.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.685
Eyes up for Commander Burnham.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.388
I wish there was
more time.

27:34.435 --> 27:35.871
There isn't.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.788
I love you.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.227
All of you.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.106
Thank you for the greatest
moments of my life.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.724
Thank you all.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.422
Let's get that crystal charged
and get to work.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.045
You're afraid.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.484
It'll be fine.

28:23.527 --> 28:26.835
Better than fine,
whatever happens.

28:26.879 --> 28:29.098
You give me too much credit.No.

28:29.142 --> 28:32.188
You taught me to walk tall and
straight into the heart of it.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.103
Just like you'll teach
your crew one day

28:34.147 --> 28:35.801
when you have your own
ship to command.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.021
Thank you for helping us.

28:39.065 --> 28:42.198
You're helping us pretty much
save the entire galaxy.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.852
You didn't have to do that.
You could have just...

28:43.896 --> 28:46.115
Stayed out of it?

28:46.159 --> 28:48.552
No.

28:48.596 --> 28:51.512
My people, my planet,
they're at risk, too.

28:51.555 --> 28:54.036
Oh, can I just say that
I love the way you say that?

28:54.080 --> 28:55.734
"My planet."
"My people."

28:55.777 --> 28:58.475
Look how far you've come.
It's beautiful, Po.

28:58.519 --> 29:02.784
Even this thing is bizarre
and super weird,

29:02.828 --> 29:04.612
but it's beautiful.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.183
Pair production's begun.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.272
There'll be enough dark energy
for the crystal soon.

29:13.273 --> 29:16.580
I'm gonna miss you,
young lady.

29:16.624 --> 29:19.366
What do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.020
What?

29:21.063 --> 29:24.893
No. No, you can't stay
on board, you're the queen.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.853
Exactly. My planet
is my sister.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.725
If I die, I die
protecting her.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.422
That's the only queen
I know how to be.

29:32.466 --> 29:35.512
Besides,
what am I supposed to do...

29:35.556 --> 29:37.297
wave a hanky from my throne?

29:37.340 --> 29:38.951
We're a team, all of us.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.823
You're stuck with me.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.786
This is stupid.
What?

29:47.829 --> 29:49.309
You flinging yourself
into the future

29:49.352 --> 29:51.790
like some galactic rubber band
with a martyr complex.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.313
It doesn't have
to be like this.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.793
It does have to be like this

29:54.836 --> 29:56.751
for a million reasons
you will never understand.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.100
I understand perfectly.

29:58.144 --> 30:00.799
You're very invested
in being selfless, Michael.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.845
And I'm not the only one willing
to exploit that, you know.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.543
You can add this up
however you want.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.329
I'm getting in that suit and
I'm doing what I need to do.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.852
And if we're both still alive
when this is all over,

30:10.896 --> 30:12.898
then you can talk to me about
my gaping character flaws.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.235
BURNHAM:
How did you know?

30:46.279 --> 30:48.063
SAREK:
Our katras.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.674
We had tried to reach you
through Starfleet.

30:52.633 --> 30:57.377
Control took down
our subspace relays.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.901
We only have ship-to-ship.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.469
You're truly leaving us,
Michael.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.866
We can't allow the data to stay.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.259
It's the only way.

31:11.521 --> 31:14.873
Michael, you do not
have to do this.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.701
Mother, yes, I do.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.838
I had lost everything.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.364
I was broken...

31:28.408 --> 31:30.889
and I was alone.

31:32.455 --> 31:38.157
You both... put me
back together.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.028
Piece by piece.

31:40.072 --> 31:43.466
Even though
you had a son,

31:43.510 --> 31:46.513
you took me in as your daughter.

31:46.556 --> 31:49.777
And as much as I tried
to push you away,

31:49.820 --> 31:52.823
you never let me go.

31:52.867 --> 31:56.044
And I love you for
never letting me go.

31:56.088 --> 32:00.266
And I need you both to know

32:00.309 --> 32:02.572
that what you gave me,

32:02.616 --> 32:07.142
I will carry it everywhere I go.

32:07.186 --> 32:10.232
And I will never let you down.

32:10.276 --> 32:13.061
Michael, we are
so proud of you...

32:13.105 --> 32:16.108
and your courage

32:16.151 --> 32:19.720
and what you are about
to do for everyone.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.986
SAREK:
It is the secret wish
of every parent that

32:25.030 --> 32:28.642
our children make right
the mistakes

32:28.685 --> 32:31.210
we ourselves have made.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.562
I know I have not always been

32:35.605 --> 32:37.520
the ideal father.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.741
Or husband, Amanda.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.699
I am...Impossible.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.094
I will accept improbable.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.969
Well, that's big of you, Father.

32:51.012 --> 32:55.712
For my failures
I humbly ask both of you

32:55.756 --> 32:58.672
for forgiveness.

33:00.717 --> 33:03.242
Of course.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.206
Promise me that you'll
take care of Spock.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.427
I will always be here
for our son, always.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.995
Even as I keep
my distance,

33:17.038 --> 33:19.040
as he has asked.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.912
He loves you very deeply.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.392
So do I.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.611
Michael.

33:26.569 --> 33:29.094
We love you.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.464
Time travel is not
for the faint of heart.

33:51.507 --> 33:54.075
Every jump, I say
a silent thank you

33:54.119 --> 33:55.598
to whatever brilliant being

33:55.642 --> 33:58.601
invented polyphobic
metamaterial.

33:58.645 --> 34:02.257
Without her or him,
I'd be dead from radiation,

34:02.301 --> 34:05.695
temperature fluctuations,
or painful blood clots.

34:05.739 --> 34:08.132
Humans were not meant for this.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.395
And that's the easy part.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.092
Navigation, on the other hand...

34:11.136 --> 34:14.094
Now I really hope whoever
you are, watching this someday,

34:14.139 --> 34:15.835
you're not crazy enough
to try a jump,

34:15.879 --> 34:17.880
but if you're as half
as stubborn as I am,

34:17.925 --> 34:20.362
let me tell you how
to do it the right way.

34:20.406 --> 34:23.103
BOTH:
Nav system appears
right before your eyes.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.759
PIKE :
All personnel,
this is the captain.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.500
20 minutes until
the Enterprisearrives.

34:27.543 --> 34:29.719
Captain Georgiou,
report to the ready room.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.983
Commander Burnham,
to the bridge immediately.

34:37.466 --> 34:40.295
You announced that
you're leaving forever,

34:40.339 --> 34:43.342
and I wasn't even there to sob
and wail and throw myself

34:43.385 --> 34:46.431
at your feet.You were a little busy.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.871
And our goodbye needed to be...

34:51.915 --> 34:53.873
Nonexistent.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.094
It's not who we are, Michael.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.227
It's not who any of us are.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.189
Some people are
still working.

35:04.232 --> 35:07.148
Uh, Po is designing siege
weapons, which I can't even...

35:07.192 --> 35:08.367
Anyway, we're here

35:08.410 --> 35:10.891
because we're
staying with you.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.893
No.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.548
No, I can't let you do this.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.115
We're not asking permission.

35:17.158 --> 35:20.074
This is impossible.
You have lives.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.859
You have people who love you.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.601
Families who love you.
You'll never see them again.

35:25.645 --> 35:30.171
Commander, our families accepted
the possibility of this moment

35:30.215 --> 35:32.042
when we joined Starfleet.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.174
Committing to a life

35:33.218 --> 35:34.654
amongst the stars
is, in itself,

35:34.697 --> 35:37.961
a resolution to leave
some things behind.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.746
But I don't know
what the future holds.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.269
STAMETS:
Nobody does.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.053
We just have now.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.446
We are coming with you, Michael.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.187
Further argument
would be futile.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.624
Please accept this.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.280
SARU:
I am sure

35:52.324 --> 35:54.935
what you are about to say
will be beautiful,

35:54.978 --> 35:58.547
but it is done, Michael,
and we are running out of time.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.462
That's kind of a problem,
actually, because the crystal

36:00.506 --> 36:02.464
isn't charging as
fast as it should be.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.118
I got you, Red. Lead the way.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.296
MAN :
All personnel...

36:09.341 --> 36:10.864
Michael.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.610
You're not coming, are you?

36:22.267 --> 36:24.921
I wish I could say yes.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.882
B-But someone has to make sure
nothing like Control

36:28.925 --> 36:31.885
ever happens again, someone
inside the gray areas.

36:31.928 --> 36:34.366
In Section 31?

36:34.409 --> 36:38.326
Otherwise we could be right back
here no matter where you end up.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.241
PIKE:
Commander Burnham,
the Enterprisewill be here

36:40.285 --> 36:42.243
in 11 minutes.
Are you on your way?

36:42.287 --> 36:43.853
I'll be right there.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.506
SARU:
There is a battle coming,
Siranna.

37:27.549 --> 37:31.727
I do not know if this message
will reach you in time.

37:33.338 --> 37:36.558
The odds are not in our favor.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.866
If we never
see each other again,

37:39.909 --> 37:43.870
you must know, sweet sister,

37:43.913 --> 37:46.002
how much I love you.

37:46.046 --> 37:48.918
I'll never know
if I made you proud.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.094
I hope so.

37:51.138 --> 37:55.534
But even if I haven't,
I made myself proud.

37:55.577 --> 38:00.452
And I can, um,
feel how you respect that.

38:00.495 --> 38:03.324
Mom, I can feel it.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.632
I can feel I frightened you
by making my own path.

38:09.069 --> 38:12.028
I hope you see this one day
and that you'll forgive me.

38:15.205 --> 38:18.383
I'll keep all of you
deep within me.

38:18.426 --> 38:20.036
I wish we had more time.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.389
I wish I could tell you
this in person, but...

38:24.432 --> 38:27.392
you're my rock, Tazzy.

38:27.435 --> 38:32.048
Every test I tanked,
the 28 times I wanted to quit,

38:32.092 --> 38:34.486
and after my injury.

38:34.529 --> 38:38.316
It only takes one person,
I guess, to save another.

38:38.359 --> 38:41.101
You're my best friend...STAMETS:
You're my best friend,

38:41.144 --> 38:45.366
and you always could translate
Mom and Dad to me

38:45.410 --> 38:47.890
and vice versa.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.806
Even though I still don't know

38:50.850 --> 38:53.635
what Dad's talking about
half the time.

38:53.679 --> 38:58.292
I know you think
I was their favorite...

38:58.336 --> 39:00.294
but I'm just louder.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.558
They love you so much.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.212
They would do anything for you.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.611
It's time.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.530
Lieutenant Detmer, put some
distance between us and Xahea.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.793
This is our fight, not theirs.Yes, Captain.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.664
SARU:
Captain,

39:22.708 --> 39:24.362
I have no confirmation
Her Serene Highness

39:24.405 --> 39:25.798
has left the ship.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.408
We'll have to have

39:27.452 --> 39:29.802
that diplomatic meltdown
some other time.

39:29.845 --> 39:33.283
I won't bother asking if you've
all committed to this decision.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.028
In that case,

39:39.072 --> 39:41.509
one last bit of housekeeping
before I can leave this ship.

39:41.553 --> 39:45.383
Discoveryis going
to need a new captain.

40:13.367 --> 40:14.847
PIKE:
Serving as your captain has been

40:14.890 --> 40:17.458
one of the greatest honors
of my career.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.504
You are exceptional officers.

40:19.547 --> 40:24.465
Exceptional individuals,
every single one of you.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.075
Lieutenants Detmer and Owosekun,

40:26.119 --> 40:27.903
I wouldn't be here if you hadn't
saved my life on the way

40:27.947 --> 40:29.339
to that asteroid.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.298
Lieutenant Nilsson,
you've stepped up for Airiam

40:31.341 --> 40:33.256
in a way that honors her.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.434
Lieutenants Bryce and Rhys,
you're calm under pressure.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.524
And Commander Saru,

40:39.567 --> 40:43.179
I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.401
Lieutenant Spock...

40:54.626 --> 40:56.584
...there aren't words.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.107
Commander Nhan has
requested permission

40:58.151 --> 41:00.632
to stay aboard Discovery.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.112
If I can be of help, that is.

41:03.156 --> 41:05.811
Well-- it would be our privilege
to have you, Commander.

41:07.290 --> 41:08.596
As for you...

41:11.294 --> 41:12.774
...most people will
never get a chance

41:12.818 --> 41:14.602
to learn what's
in their own hearts.

41:14.646 --> 41:18.040
If we figure it out, it's
often not what we expected,

41:18.084 --> 41:20.390
or even what we would have
chosen for ourselves.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.352
I am very grateful, Commander,

41:25.395 --> 41:29.095
to have been here to watch you
discover your heart.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.314
Thank you.

41:31.358 --> 41:36.058
I know that you...
I know that all of you

41:36.102 --> 41:39.801
will face your destinies
with bravery and honor.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.194
Even those moments to come

41:41.237 --> 41:43.239
that will test the
strongest among us.

41:43.283 --> 41:48.157
Thank you... sir.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.552
Mr. Saru,

41:51.596 --> 41:52.901
you have the conn
as Commander Burnham leads you

41:52.945 --> 41:54.337
through the wormhole.

41:54.381 --> 41:56.339
As to what happens after that...

41:56.383 --> 41:59.386
I would prefer if we focus
on our respective tasks for now

41:59.429 --> 42:00.996
and discuss the captaincy later.

42:01.040 --> 42:04.739
There are many things
to consider.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.264
NUMBER ONE:
Enterpriseto Discovery.

42:08.308 --> 42:09.527
Control's fleet will be arriving

42:09.570 --> 42:11.746
in four minutes, 58 seconds,
Captain.

42:11.790 --> 42:14.532
Thank you, Number One.
Mr. Bryce,

42:14.575 --> 42:17.099
make sure anyone else who
wants to leave is on their way.Aye, Captain.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.058
The rest of you...

42:20.494 --> 42:22.496
...back to work.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.587
Captain Pike.

43:12.459 --> 43:14.330
STAMETS:
At this rate,
the crystal won't be charged

43:14.374 --> 43:17.507
before Leland arrives.
And you do know

43:17.551 --> 43:19.945
that the suit is utterly useless
without the crystal, don't you?

43:19.988 --> 43:22.251
Preacher, choir. Why do
you think I asked for help?

43:22.295 --> 43:24.079
Sir, sorry, I,

43:24.123 --> 43:26.212
I get a little snarky
when I'm stressed.

43:26.255 --> 43:28.606
The problem is the cage. It's
interfering with the charge.

43:28.649 --> 43:30.520
Yeah, but without the cage...

43:30.564 --> 43:32.653
Everyone will see visions
of the future

43:32.697 --> 43:34.263
and their heads will explode,
I know.

43:34.307 --> 43:36.309
Okay, ideas. Go.

43:36.352 --> 43:40.356
Well, we could move the charging
unit inside the cage.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.054
And potentially redistribute
the charge

43:42.097 --> 43:43.621
to the point of instability?

43:43.664 --> 43:45.013
No. Next?

43:45.057 --> 43:46.449
Well, what if we, uh, increase

43:46.493 --> 43:47.755
the diameter
of the cage openings?

43:47.799 --> 43:49.409
That way, the wavelength

43:49.452 --> 43:51.541
of the charging frequency
can move through faster.

43:51.585 --> 43:54.327
And that may let the effects
of the crystal seep out,

43:54.370 --> 43:56.068
which is why the cage is there.

43:56.111 --> 43:58.548
BRYCE:
Attention:
final shuttles are departing.

43:58.592 --> 43:59.985
Transporter power diverting

44:00.028 --> 44:02.814
to defense systems
in three minutes.

44:02.857 --> 44:04.467
Okay, out, both of you.

44:04.511 --> 44:05.991
Make sure nobody else comes in.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.601
Wait. You're not gonna...

44:07.645 --> 44:09.081
Got a better idea?

44:09.124 --> 44:11.257
The mission's the mission,
whatever I see.

44:12.606 --> 44:13.999
Look, buck up, guys.

44:14.042 --> 44:15.565
I'll be fine.

44:20.135 --> 44:22.398
Thank you, Jett.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.619
I still dislike you.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.534
Feeling's mutual.

44:38.327 --> 44:39.807
OWOSEKUN:
An undetonated photon torpedo
is lodged

44:39.851 --> 44:41.243
inEnterprise's hull!

44:45.987 --> 44:49.077
Mr. Bryce, open a ship-wide
channel, please.

44:49.121 --> 44:50.513
Aye, sir.

44:50.557 --> 44:51.689
Channel open.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.692
This is Commander Saru.

44:54.735 --> 44:57.042
All crew to stations
immediately.

44:57.085 --> 44:59.348
Red alert.

45:08.575 --> 45:10.403
Captain, we are standing by.

45:10.446 --> 45:11.752
Leaving now, Mr. Saru.

45:11.796 --> 45:13.493
I haven't been sure
what to make of you lately,

45:13.536 --> 45:15.887
but I'm glad to have had you
on our side for this.

45:15.930 --> 45:18.498
More fun to come,
assuming we survive.

45:18.541 --> 45:21.196
Good luck.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.372
Glad to have you
on our side, too, Mr. Tyler.

45:23.416 --> 45:24.983
As am I.

45:25.026 --> 45:26.898
Does that mean you trust me?

45:26.941 --> 45:28.682
Why do you ask?

45:28.726 --> 45:30.205
Because there's something
I need to do.

45:30.249 --> 45:32.947
And it means leaving
before any of this starts.

45:32.991 --> 45:34.209
Initializing.

45:36.168 --> 45:38.126
I'm Terran, by the way.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.912
From your mirror universe.

45:40.955 --> 45:42.957
What mirror universe?

45:46.308 --> 45:48.267
DETMER:
Attention, all vessels.

45:48.310 --> 45:50.660
Leland's fleet has arrived.

46:18.297 --> 46:20.516
WOMAN:
Captain on the bridge.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.563
Nine more enemy vessels just
dropped out of warp, Captain.

46:26.261 --> 46:27.262
We are surrounded.

46:27.306 --> 46:29.090
All enemy vessels
armed and ready.

46:30.135 --> 46:31.789
Shields up.

46:32.877 --> 46:34.922
Prepare for battle.
