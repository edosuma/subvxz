WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:10.886
Commander General,
you are called to answer

00:10.969 --> 00:12.846
for the escape
of the prisoner, Tamacti Jun.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.307
Tamacti Jun was not my prisoner.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.228
-But Baba Voss was.
-Baba Voss was an enemy of the Republic.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.355
Who should have been put on trial

00:21.438 --> 00:24.608
and executed expeditiously,
as the law requires.

00:24.691 --> 00:28.570
Had you done that,
he never would have had the opportunity

00:28.654 --> 00:30.280
to escape with Tamacti Jun.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.616
The Witchfinder was a potential source

00:32.698 --> 00:36.787
of great intelligence for us
on the Payan queen's larger strategy

00:36.870 --> 00:38.330
and military assets.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.250
Do you have any idea
how they managed to escape?

00:41.792 --> 00:45.170
Such a devastating breach
in our security is unheard of.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.924
They must have had help.
Someone on the inside.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.053
Then we must ferret out
the traitor, or traitors,

00:53.136 --> 00:54.388
and make an example of them.

00:54.471 --> 00:58.308
If there are traitors, I will find them.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.730
General Voss, you have served this council

01:03.814 --> 01:06.859
with great honor and valor for many years,

01:06.942 --> 01:09.862
but your obsession
with the rumors of the return of sight,

01:09.945 --> 01:14.783
your personal vendetta with your brother,
they must be put aside.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.994
The Ganites grow
ever more bold in the west.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.579
You are our greatest tactician.

01:18.662 --> 01:22.583
We need you focused
on the true threats to this republic.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.294
Do you understand?

01:29.840 --> 01:34.761
Yes. I understand, sir.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.354
I want you to question every guard
who came in contact

01:44.438 --> 01:45.856
with Baba Voss or Tamacti Jun.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.192
I already did, sir.
They didn't have anything useful to offer.

01:48.275 --> 01:52.696
Well, then question them again.
Someone will break.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.198
Yes, sir.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.174
Who's there?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.468
-It's okay.
-Oloman?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.553
It's okay.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.317
Another bad dream?

03:55.444 --> 03:56.695
You don't understand.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.740
The dreams are beautiful.

04:01.158 --> 04:05.746
I can see the world, my children.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.000
It's when I wake up
that the nightmare starts.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.172
We're still here, Father.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.673
We'd never leave you.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.598
Have you found a way to fix this?

04:25.307 --> 04:28.101
I know it can be done
with the right equipment.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.773
We simply don't have the machines,
the technology to do the things you ask.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.496
Have you forgotten everything
that I taught you?

04:51.917 --> 04:54.169
It's been my life's work
to build this place.

04:56.338 --> 05:00.175
Through setbacks and overwhelming odds,
I persevered.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.262
Now you…

05:07.140 --> 05:09.184
You must rise to the challenge.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.481
Take what seems impossible
and make it possible.

05:16.108 --> 05:20.320
You must dedicate your every
waking moment to restoring my sight

05:20.404 --> 05:22.823
so that I can fulfill my destiny.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.993
Now, it won't happen overnight,

05:27.202 --> 05:30.956
and I was wrong to make you feel
like it should.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.336
We must both settle in and persevere.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.173
No matter how long it takes.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.844
Yes, Father.

05:44.928 --> 05:45.929
All right.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.184
Now, your morning report?

05:51.351 --> 05:52.227
Now?

05:52.311 --> 05:54.438
Our work here continues, does it not?

05:56.690 --> 05:57.858
Of course it does, it's just--

05:57.941 --> 06:02.446
I may be injured,
but I am not compromised.

06:02.529 --> 06:06.283
And you shouldn't treat me as such,
or the children might follow suit.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.452
And the Trivantians…

06:11.997 --> 06:14.750
The Trivantians…

06:14.833 --> 06:16.502
they must not know of my injury.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.505
It is their fear of my abilities
that keeps them in check.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.672
Do you understand?

06:23.634 --> 06:24.635
Yes, Father.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.138
Good.

06:29.306 --> 06:33.810
Then… your morning report.

06:37.648 --> 06:42.402
Well, Nonni has moved on
to quadratic equations.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.489
She's very smart.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.367
I started her on the text
that you suggested.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.661
She took to it like a moth to a flame.

07:14.268 --> 07:17.896
They left before the agreed-upon time.
Something must have happened.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.773
We don't have time to search for them.

07:19.857 --> 07:23.402
Our priority must be
to find Princess Maghra.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.033
Princess Maghra? What is he talking about?

07:33.036 --> 07:37.499
If he is to be believed,
your mother is sister to the queen.

07:39.918 --> 07:44.006
-Queen Kane? That is ridiculous.
-I know it is hard to believe.

07:44.089 --> 07:48.135
What's hard to believe is that you didn't
tear him to pieces the moment you met him.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.970
I did consider it.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.558
-This could be a trap, Papa.
-Yes.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.227
And yet you allow him to lead us. Why?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.565
For the same reasons I came
to find you in Trivantes.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.401
She's my wife, Haniwa.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.154
It's the only woman I will ever love.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.239
And if there's the smallest chance
that she's alive…

08:09.323 --> 08:10.532
I understand.

08:14.244 --> 08:18.582
But if he is lying,
then I want to kill him with you.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.210
I give you my word.

08:22.753 --> 08:27.132
And if he is not lying,
then my mother is a Payan princess.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.383
How could that be?

08:30.219 --> 08:31.553
I do not have answers.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.140
I trust your mother will explain
once we find her.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.433
Come.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.699
Three horses, two dogs.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.036
-Trivantians?
-Witchfinders.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.746
If they hurt my son--

08:57.829 --> 08:59.957
Witchfinders serve the pleasure
of the queen.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.751
If Maghra is with the queen,
then their orders will be

09:02.835 --> 09:05.045
to find and retrieve her children.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.756
-But the queen would have them burned.
-No.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.717
I learned that the queen issued
a new decree.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.512
The sighted are no longer
to be considered witches.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.473
So where do we go?

09:16.557 --> 09:20.269
East. There's a Witchfinder camp nearby.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.521
They'll know where the queen is settled.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.607
Pennsa.

09:25.691 --> 09:26.859
What?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.069
They took Kofun to Pennsa.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.406
-Did he leave you a sign?
-Yes.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.658
Pennsa.

09:35.158 --> 09:39.746
Highly fortified, prosperous,
strategically located.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.584
I would guess the queen
has consecrated a new capital.

10:02.561 --> 10:06.148
What is this vital matter
that couldn't wait, Lord Harlan?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.025
I don't mean to be alarmist,

10:08.108 --> 10:12.029
but when Your Majesty's
personal safety's at stake,

10:12.112 --> 10:14.990
I'd rather be guilty of overreacting
than complacency.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.410
Must everything with you include a speech?

10:19.745 --> 10:21.747
I'll keep it brief. I promise.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.250
I want you to hear this firsthand.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.922
I only ask that you stay very, very still.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.509
If he knows you're here,
I fear he won't speak freely.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.221
I'll be silent as a spider.

10:47.314 --> 10:52.945
Lord Harlan, this is Zechan,
the man who requested the audience.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.947
Thank you, Kerrigan.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.544
Is someone else in the room?

11:09.294 --> 11:12.714
A trusted servant loyal to me.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.467
Where are you from, Zechan?

11:16.969 --> 11:18.095
Kanzua, sir.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.598
And you were a palace sentry at Kanzua?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.851
Yes, sir. For over 20 years.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.063
So you were there
when the Trivantians attacked?

11:30.858 --> 11:33.026
I was there when Kanzua fell.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.949
But the thing of it is,
there was no attack.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.537
Then how did the dam come to be destroyed?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.123
I can't say for sure, sir.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.418
All I know is, there were no Trivantians.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.713
I don't understand.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.800
It was a regular day.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.428
Birds and wind.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.307
Not once did I hear the sound
of Trivantian stingers.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.766
No war cries.

12:07.060 --> 12:12.357
So if it wasn't the Trivantians,
who was responsible?

12:18.197 --> 12:20.407
You have to understand, sir.

12:20.490 --> 12:24.494
My father was a guard at Kanzua,
as was his father before him.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.788
We have served the monarchy
for generations.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.332
I understand. I understand.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.548
It's all right.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.176
Say what you came to say, soldier.

12:43.305 --> 12:48.393
I knew those buildings inside and out,
every passageway, who had access.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.772
And I believe that the only person
who could have released the waters…

12:55.400 --> 12:57.236
was the queen herself.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.050
Lord Harlan, you do have a flair
for the dramatic.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.095
This kind of talk, you know…

14:06.180 --> 14:08.765
left unchecked,
it can spread like a plague.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.478
And if the people doubt
your account of Kanzua,

14:14.188 --> 14:16.690
they will doubt the sighted child
you spoke of,

14:17.191 --> 14:19.026
and your mandate from God.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.154
All of it.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.577
You will make sure that won't happen.

14:30.329 --> 14:32.748
It's the least I can do
if it threatens my queen.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.376
And just think
how much more vigilant I'd be

14:37.085 --> 14:39.421
if it threatened the sister
of my own wife.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.676
Urgent message for you, my queen.

14:46.595 --> 14:47.679
Come.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.876
Rest assured, Harlan,
you'll have your bride.

15:39.523 --> 15:44.027
Sibeth, please.
I have no fight left in me right now.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.488
Relax, Sister. I come bearing good news.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.491
Kofun has been found.

15:50.868 --> 15:53.704
My soldiers are making their way back here
with him as we speak.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.832
What? When will they arrive?

15:56.915 --> 15:59.168
What about Haniwa and Baba Voss?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.461
No sign of them, I'm afraid.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.964
That doesn't make sense.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.425
He would have kept them together
at all costs.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.928
Unless he no longer could.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.474
And now that Kofun will be joining us,

16:14.558 --> 16:17.186
we are faced with the issue of his safety.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.562
Safety?

16:18.645 --> 16:22.858
As you witnessed, it will take some time
before the people embrace the new way.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.820
You had no such concerns about Boots.

16:28.780 --> 16:29.990
Boots is nobody.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.659
Just the father of your child.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.247
What?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.794
I can hear your heartbeat
growing faster, Sibeth.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.299
But only your heart.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.428
The baby.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.806
You lost the baby.

16:57.935 --> 17:01.396
Sibeth. I'm so sorry.

17:37.349 --> 17:41.603
Your child returns
while mine has decided not to come at all.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.692
Which does put us
in a somewhat difficult position.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.989
If word gets out that I'm not with child,

17:52.489 --> 17:54.950
the protection of sighted children
will be called into question

17:55.033 --> 17:56.910
even more than it already is.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.162
Kofun's safety will not be ensured.

17:59.872 --> 18:02.082
I don't understand this conversation.

18:02.165 --> 18:05.335
-Are you threatening my son?
-On the contrary.

18:05.419 --> 18:08.005
I'll do everything in my power
to protect my nephew.

18:08.755 --> 18:13.218
But if the people rise against me,
against us,

18:14.178 --> 18:16.221
there'll be no one left to protect him.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.765
This is about Harlan.

18:20.142 --> 18:24.271
An alliance with Lord Harlan guarantees us
control over a united military

18:24.354 --> 18:27.691
that will serve as the ultimate deterrent
to any talk of revolution.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.403
Why are you so insistent on this?
What aren't you telling me?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.620
Apparently, there are survivors of Kanzua.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.833
-If word spreads…
-Word will spread.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.962
The only question is how well positioned
we will be to quell any unrest

18:49.046 --> 18:51.256
to assert our authority when it does.

18:52.716 --> 18:58.138
A man in Harlan's position,
he could pour the water or fan flames,

18:58.222 --> 18:59.890
depending on where his interests lie.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.727
And right now, what he wants is you.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.691
Sister. I know what I'm asking of you.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.402
-I wouldn't ask it, but--
-Shh. Just-- Just…

19:34.925 --> 19:35.926
Fine.

19:39.388 --> 19:40.556
Fine.

19:40.639 --> 19:46.770
I'll agree to this charade
as long as Harlan understands

19:46.854 --> 19:49.398
it's simply an arrangement of convenience.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.361
As all marriages are.

20:21.513 --> 20:24.933
I still can't imagine
my mother as a princess.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.729
Maghra Kane was born to rule.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.647
Her father's daughter in every way.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.193
Yet you hunted her like an animal.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.277
No.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.573
My charge was to find the witch,
Jerlamarel, and then his children.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.784
Maghra was believed to be dead.

20:44.995 --> 20:48.290
-We should camp here.
-We just started walking.

20:48.790 --> 20:52.085
It's a difficult passage up
through the foothills.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.630
Your father will need rest.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.882
Do not speak for me, Witchfinder.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.384
Okay, then I'll speak for myself.

21:00.010 --> 21:03.388
Like you, I've lost blood.
Like you, I haven't eaten in days.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.474
And although I haven't been whipped
on the rack like you--

21:05.557 --> 21:06.767
Shh! Tamacti.

21:10.771 --> 21:14.358
-What do you see, my love?
-Cages of the God bone.

21:15.359 --> 21:17.402
-Shit.
-What?

21:18.195 --> 21:19.530
It's a Slaver's den.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.534
-You know this place from before?
-No, I do not.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.410
Tamacti, we must move quickly. Come.

21:25.494 --> 21:27.829
Papa, it's okay. There's no one coming.

21:29.540 --> 21:30.791
They're already here.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.464
Stand where you are.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.092
Greetings, friend.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.679
If we are trespassing, I apologize.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.307
We have no intentions other than
to get to the eastern foothills.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.102
What's your business in the foothills?

21:50.894 --> 21:52.688
The Yuree cattle markets.

21:56.275 --> 21:57.401
You may go.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.528
Thank you.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.576
Not you, girl.

22:05.659 --> 22:06.743
Papa!

22:24.094 --> 22:25.095
Papa!

22:30.684 --> 22:33.770
You'll be taught obedience, girl.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.718
Who's there? Speak!

23:46.802 --> 23:49.263
Catch your breath, Baba. You are safe.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.347
Paris!

23:50.430 --> 23:51.431
Haniwa!

23:54.518 --> 23:57.396
-Paris. Who fights with us?
-Baba.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.065
I will explain more
when we are somewhere safe.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.693
-Where's Kofun?
-Kofun has gone on to Pennsa.

24:02.776 --> 24:04.444
And I have important news.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.280
Maghra is alive.

24:06.363 --> 24:07.781
-You've heard?
-Yes.

24:08.991 --> 24:10.534
You should've went with Kofun.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.579
Well, then where would you be now,
you big lump?

24:13.662 --> 24:15.038
-We'll go now.
-No.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.665
You're not fit to travel.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.251
I hear deep pain in your voice.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.171
You must rest and heal
before we can make this journey.

24:22.254 --> 24:23.255
Baba Voss.

24:25.841 --> 24:26.967
Paris, wait.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.260
-Tamacti Jun.
-Paris.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.972
The Witchfinder general.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.348
What a find.

24:33.432 --> 24:35.893
After we kill him,
I'll keep his ears as a trophy.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.895
No. We need his help.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.814
We never would have made it
out of Trivantes without him.

24:40.898 --> 24:43.567
-He's no longer one of them.
-Even if that were true--

24:43.650 --> 24:48.280
He can track the queen's soldiers.
He's helping me find Maghra.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.699
We are not bringing
a Witchfinder home with us.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.869
We're not going anywhere with you.
We're going to Pennsa.

24:53.952 --> 24:58.665
Haniwa, your father needs rest.
Even now, his breath fails him.

24:59.750 --> 25:00.751
Papa.

25:04.213 --> 25:05.464
Where is this home?

25:05.964 --> 25:08.175
It does not matter.
We are going straight to Pennsa.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.136
Baba, we have made camp nearby.

25:11.762 --> 25:14.473
Rest for the night.
Then we go on to Pennsa from there.

25:14.556 --> 25:17.434
You cannot really mean
that we will travel with the Witchfinder.

25:17.518 --> 25:20.395
Where we go, he goes. Yes?

25:20.896 --> 25:21.939
So be it.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.733
Vienna, Quito, return home.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.986
Inform them
that we are going on to Pennsa.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.738
Charlotte, to the camp.

25:38.163 --> 25:40.832
Some 200 years ago,

25:40.916 --> 25:45.879
a small number of Payan children
were born with vision.

25:47.422 --> 25:52.010
Their mothers fled to the mountains
to hide them from the Witchfinders.

25:53.345 --> 25:57.850
But eventually they were found and burned.

26:00.561 --> 26:03.438
Those grieving mothers formed the Compass.

26:04.773 --> 26:07.192
It's a secret society of guardians

26:07.693 --> 26:11.029
whose membership is passed on
from mother to daughter.

26:12.573 --> 26:15.409
We've remained a secret for generations,

26:15.909 --> 26:18.787
standing by,
ready to take on the sacred duty

26:18.871 --> 26:21.623
of protecting the sighted
when vision returns.

26:22.207 --> 26:24.209
And how many sighted children
have you met?

26:25.669 --> 26:28.380
Counting you? One.

26:28.463 --> 26:31.300
And that is one more
than my mother or her mother met.

26:31.383 --> 26:34.052
I never imagined it
would happen in my lifetime, but it has.

26:35.387 --> 26:37.472
Paris, what do you have to do with them?

26:40.726 --> 26:44.354
That is a long story. And a sad one.

26:46.356 --> 26:47.858
You were one of them.

26:50.736 --> 26:53.655
Yes, I was.

26:58.994 --> 27:00.412
A lifetime ago.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.416
No one ever blamed you, Paris.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.878
Nevertheless, it was my responsibility.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.424
The curse of every Presage I've ever met.

27:12.508 --> 27:15.844
You all think you're responsible
for knowing everything before it happens.

27:17.763 --> 27:21.058
Is it true that Queen Kane decreed
the sighted are no longer witches?

27:21.683 --> 27:22.893
That's the talk.

27:22.976 --> 27:26.271
This queen's
proclamation is ill-conceived.

27:26.355 --> 27:29.525
Bigotry cannot be changed by decree.

27:30.192 --> 27:32.361
If anything, she's made you
even more of a target.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.409
Which may be as she intended.

27:48.293 --> 27:49.920
I guess he needed to sleep.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.505
So do I.

27:51.588 --> 27:55.092
Which is why I put enough valerian root
in his ale to knock out a horse.

27:55.175 --> 27:58.971
'Cause if he's not snoring,
I'm up all night with my ropes in my hand.

27:59.638 --> 28:01.056
More grub anybody?

28:05.102 --> 28:07.688
Come on, Toad.
You took the same oath we did.

28:07.771 --> 28:10.190
To seek out and destroy
the witches no matter the cost.

28:10.274 --> 28:12.442
We serve the queen, Dax.
We follow her orders.

28:12.526 --> 28:14.027
Not when the orders are heresy.

28:14.111 --> 28:16.738
God Flame first, Queen second.

28:16.822 --> 28:19.074
Dax is right. This feels wrong.

28:19.575 --> 28:22.160
-We're breaking the law.
-We've been tasked with his safety.

28:22.953 --> 28:24.705
He's the queen's nephew.

28:24.788 --> 28:27.082
What do you think she'll do
to the man who harms him?

28:27.165 --> 28:28.917
We cannot ride into Pennsa with a witch,

28:29.001 --> 28:30.961
we'll be shunned or burned
as heretics right beside him.

28:31.044 --> 28:31.879
Don't be an idiot.

28:31.962 --> 28:33.630
We should be gutting him,
not escorting him.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.591
You don't wanna kill him?
Fine, don't kill him.

28:35.674 --> 28:37.509
Let's just leave him here
and say he ran away.

28:37.593 --> 28:38.677
Let the forest have him.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.346
Come on, Toad. You know he's right.

28:41.430 --> 28:42.431
No.

28:42.973 --> 28:46.977
What he is is one word away from
an insubordination charge and a demotion.

28:47.477 --> 28:49.563
And he'll take you right down with him.

28:50.731 --> 28:53.233
Shut your mouths and do your fucking jobs.

28:54.359 --> 28:55.611
And if you're lucky,

28:56.111 --> 28:59.239
I'll forget this conversation happened
by the time we reach Pennsa.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.456
You should announce yourself.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.999
Apologies, Princess.

29:51.083 --> 29:53.418
I keep forgetting
it's not my house anymore.

29:55.796 --> 29:58.215
Whistle sword, weapon of kings.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.008
And their daughters.

30:01.093 --> 30:02.219
You sent for me?

30:02.928 --> 30:03.929
Yes, I did.

30:05.180 --> 30:09.935
-This marriage proposal of yours--
-I made no such proposal.

30:10.018 --> 30:11.854
Well, my sister did it for you.

30:12.604 --> 30:14.481
That is unfortunate.

30:14.565 --> 30:17.067
Let me assure you,
I had something more romantic in mind.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.028
-I have a husband.
-We all have our flaws.

30:20.904 --> 30:24.116
I tend to snore if I sleep on my back.
But piece of advice--

30:24.199 --> 30:26.159
-Harlan. Harlan.
-…a swift kick will usually shut me up,

30:26.243 --> 30:27.619
-so I'm told.
-Harlan!

30:29.413 --> 30:30.998
What is it you're really after?

30:43.552 --> 30:45.762
I come from a rich tradition of men

30:46.847 --> 30:49.766
who fought for crumbs
at the feet of the monarchy.

30:52.519 --> 30:58.192
Now, I worked tirelessly for many years

30:59.151 --> 31:01.653
to get something better for myself.

31:04.573 --> 31:06.575
It took some doing, believe me.

31:07.159 --> 31:09.703
And now, in walks the queen,

31:10.621 --> 31:14.124
and she screws it all up
with this war of hers.

31:14.208 --> 31:16.627
And I find myself with two choices.

31:18.003 --> 31:22.132
One: I stoke the fires of rebellion
and burn down the whole palace,

31:23.550 --> 31:27.221
or two: I join you and move into it.

31:30.599 --> 31:35.062
After much consideration, Princess,
I've reached a conclusion.

31:36.355 --> 31:38.148
Number two is a lot less work.

31:40.359 --> 31:42.152
You're wooing the wrong sister.

31:42.778 --> 31:45.906
-I'm wooing the better sister.
-Sibeth is the one with the power.

31:46.573 --> 31:47.783
For now.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.338
-We will announce an engagement.
-Excellent.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.548
But there will be no wedding.

32:03.257 --> 32:04.883
Not to put too fine a point on it--

32:04.967 --> 32:07.261
The engagement will ease
my sister's concerns

32:07.344 --> 32:09.513
about Kanzua for the time being.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.391
You will use your influence
with the council

32:12.474 --> 32:14.643
to help me stop her from going to war.

32:15.227 --> 32:17.980
And once my husband
and my daughter are found,

32:18.480 --> 32:21.859
you will make sure
that they are protected at all costs.

32:25.571 --> 32:26.738
And in exchange?

32:28.657 --> 32:32.661
I will convince Sibeth to make her capital
in a more suitable city,

32:32.744 --> 32:34.955
and you will have yours back.

32:37.708 --> 32:38.709
Maghra.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.546
I believe I underestimated you.

32:44.173 --> 32:46.008
Well, I hope I've done the same.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.302
Time will tell, Princess.

33:21.126 --> 33:23.378
-Chet-chet.
-Chet-chet.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.009
Hot tea.

33:40.354 --> 33:43.982
So, you were a Compass warrior?

33:45.400 --> 33:49.196
Guardian.
Lost the appetite for it long ago.

33:53.283 --> 33:54.493
Why did you leave?

34:01.333 --> 34:07.130
When I was with the Compass, Haniwa,
it was a thrilling time.

34:08.090 --> 34:12.094
Two hundred years without reports
of a sighted child,

34:12.177 --> 34:16.181
and then suddenly there appeared a boy.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.768
I was assigned to protect him.

34:20.268 --> 34:22.728
He was gifted beyond his sight.

34:22.813 --> 34:27.568
I mean, his young mind
just cried out for knowledge…

34:29.277 --> 34:30.612
like yours did.

34:34.699 --> 34:35.951
I broke the rules.

34:38.078 --> 34:41.581
I allowed him access
to the artifacts we stored.

34:41.665 --> 34:42.666
Books…

34:44.458 --> 34:47.420
and the knotted codes
that would teach him to read.

34:48.672 --> 34:53.385
Soon, I couldn't find enough books
to satisfy his hunger for knowledge.

34:55.137 --> 34:57.639
I woke up one day and he was gone,

34:58.473 --> 35:02.060
along with the books
and the knotted codes.

35:06.315 --> 35:08.066
I failed the Compass.

35:09.318 --> 35:13.363
I failed in the thing
that I was sworn to do.

35:14.489 --> 35:17.242
So I did the only thing I could. I left.

35:23.248 --> 35:26.835
Do you know what became of him? The boy?

35:32.007 --> 35:34.176
He became your father.

35:45.896 --> 35:47.064
Jerlamarel.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.107
Yes.

35:52.194 --> 35:56.114
Years later, as your mother carried you,
Jerlamarel found me.

35:56.615 --> 35:58.075
He knew I was Alkenny.

35:58.992 --> 36:03.705
He knew I would protect
and guide his children.

36:04.498 --> 36:06.583
And make sure we knew how to read.

36:09.837 --> 36:12.256
I'm hoping that was the right choice.

36:19.137 --> 36:20.389
Of course it was.

36:21.765 --> 36:25.727
Sight is as much a part of me

36:27.229 --> 36:30.190
as your hands are a part of you.

36:32.568 --> 36:34.903
It would be wrong for me not to read.

36:40.534 --> 36:41.743
Dear one…

36:44.162 --> 36:47.457
humankind has a long history--

36:48.208 --> 36:53.922
a long history of despising and fearing
those who are different.

36:54.923 --> 36:56.592
Nobody chooses how they're born.

36:57.926 --> 37:02.222
And yet the unsighted persecute
the sighted.

37:06.810 --> 37:12.441
If one day the sighted outnumber
the unsighted again,

37:13.525 --> 37:15.235
the roles will reverse.

37:17.154 --> 37:22.034
It is one of the many ways
in which we all are very much the same.

37:54.942 --> 37:56.109
What are you doing?

37:56.193 --> 37:57.611
My job, witch.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.905
-Toad!
-Shut up.

38:00.405 --> 38:01.406
Hold him still!

38:07.788 --> 38:09.206
Come on, witch!

38:13.836 --> 38:14.878
Toad!

38:27.224 --> 38:30.811
Dax! Frye! What the fuck are you doing?

38:30.894 --> 38:32.145
Fall in!

38:35.566 --> 38:36.400
Toad!

38:40.571 --> 38:42.281
Frye! Stop, Frye.

38:42.781 --> 38:44.616
Toad! Toad!

38:44.700 --> 38:46.660
Toad! Toad! Toad!

38:48.871 --> 38:50.956
Toad! Toad!

38:51.039 --> 38:53.041
Toad! Toad!

38:57.045 --> 38:59.965
Toad. Toad.

39:00.465 --> 39:03.218
-Dax. Dax!
-Toad.

39:05.387 --> 39:06.388
Frye?

39:08.223 --> 39:09.224
Frye?

39:10.893 --> 39:12.728
-Frye!
-Stay down, Dax.

39:13.812 --> 39:14.813
What'd you do?

39:15.939 --> 39:17.316
Stay the fuck down.

39:18.650 --> 39:19.568
You killed him.

39:20.152 --> 39:22.196
And I'll kill you too
if you don't stand down right now.

39:23.906 --> 39:27.242
What's wrong with you?
You're a Witchfinder protecting a witch!

39:27.326 --> 39:29.661
I'm not gonna tell you again, Dax!

39:29.745 --> 39:31.872
Stand the fuck down! Now!

39:37.127 --> 39:38.212
I'm leaving.

39:39.213 --> 39:40.964
I want no part of this.

39:41.048 --> 39:43.091
If you wanna desert,
take your horse and go.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.427
But if you attempt to interfere
with this mission,

39:45.511 --> 39:47.262
I will kill you where you stand.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.210
-Toad.
-Shut up.

40:26.844 --> 40:28.136
Can you ride a horse?

40:30.848 --> 40:31.849
Not really.

40:34.393 --> 40:35.978
Well, I hope you're a quick learner.

40:38.605 --> 40:40.065
'Cause you're not riding with me.

41:05.507 --> 41:08.010
Why didn't you kill Edo
when you had the chance?

41:12.598 --> 41:16.476
Killing a brother would be
like killing a part of yourself.

41:19.938 --> 41:21.648
Like killing your own father?

41:32.701 --> 41:35.495
My father ordered me to kill Edo.

41:37.664 --> 41:39.082
And I made a choice.

41:46.882 --> 41:50.219
If you were protecting Edo,
then why does he hate you so much?

41:55.015 --> 41:58.560
Family can be complicated.

42:05.943 --> 42:06.818
Well…

42:08.320 --> 42:12.199
I was just kidnapped by my uncle

42:12.282 --> 42:15.494
and found out that my mom is a princess.

42:18.497 --> 42:21.625
I think I know something
about complicated families.

42:33.178 --> 42:35.430
My mother died giving birth to Edo.

42:37.683 --> 42:39.852
And my father never forgave him for that.

42:40.978 --> 42:44.606
I was just a young boy,
almost too young to remember her.

42:46.608 --> 42:49.319
And too young
to question my father's point of view.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.333
You asked for me, sir?

43:06.587 --> 43:08.547
The girl, Haniwa, is an archer.

43:10.549 --> 43:11.675
Is she?

43:12.634 --> 43:14.511
She put three arrows in me.

43:16.680 --> 43:20.142
My brother has raised
two of Jerlamarel's children.

43:20.642 --> 43:22.895
That is a dangerous combination.

43:25.063 --> 43:29.818
A group of Slavers was killed
at a den in Munhall today.

43:31.403 --> 43:32.779
You think it was them?

43:36.116 --> 43:39.328
Baba's hurt. He's tired.
He won't be moving very fast.

43:40.871 --> 43:43.207
Send word to every outpost in the area…

43:44.791 --> 43:48.921
that I want Baba and the girl
brought back to me alive.

43:51.548 --> 43:52.382
Yes, sir.

43:53.634 --> 43:54.635
Lieutenant?

44:06.188 --> 44:09.399
Any word on who helped them escape?

44:12.402 --> 44:13.695
No, sir. Nothing yet.

44:17.699 --> 44:21.036
That's odd, Wren. That's very odd.

44:24.831 --> 44:27.167
But I think
I might have an idea about that.

44:29.503 --> 44:30.754
Keep me informed.

44:31.588 --> 44:32.589
Yes, sir.

44:52.359 --> 44:54.319
-Toad.
-What?

44:58.949 --> 45:00.659
Thank you for saving my life.

45:04.621 --> 45:06.456
Your gratitude is misplaced.

45:07.749 --> 45:10.836
You're Princess Maghra's son,
and I'm duty bound to protect you.

45:12.421 --> 45:13.630
I had no choice.

45:18.802 --> 45:20.345
You had a choice.

45:48.540 --> 45:49.708
Give me the map.

46:06.266 --> 46:09.978
It'll take 13 days to get to Pennsa
if the weather holds.

46:10.479 --> 46:12.564
We can get there in half that time.

46:12.648 --> 46:14.399
What? How?

46:16.443 --> 46:17.444
This way.

46:22.449 --> 46:23.742
There's a cliff.

46:24.368 --> 46:26.662
Yes, according to the map.

46:26.745 --> 46:29.498
But there is no cliff.
We can go straight through.

46:29.581 --> 46:30.582
And how do you know that?

46:31.542 --> 46:33.001
They make the maps.

46:33.877 --> 46:35.379
That's how we've kept our outpost

46:35.462 --> 46:38.382
hidden all these centuries
from bastards like you.

46:39.758 --> 46:40.759
Haniwa?

46:41.260 --> 46:44.721
I am charged
with your protection at any cost.

46:45.389 --> 46:48.767
You will always stay behind me.

46:49.476 --> 46:51.854
Always behind me.

46:52.521 --> 46:56.149
Your father always behind you.

46:56.233 --> 46:58.610
I don't need a guardian.
I can take care of myself.

46:59.945 --> 47:02.698
You were almost made
a breeding machine in Trivantes.

47:02.781 --> 47:04.074
And I got out.

47:04.157 --> 47:06.159
And nearly lost your head
at a Slaver's camp.

47:06.243 --> 47:08.245
At this rate,
I expect you'll be dead within the week.

47:09.121 --> 47:10.205
Haniwa.

47:15.043 --> 47:16.628
Just don't get in my way.

47:17.212 --> 47:19.548
You're the sighted one. Don't get in mine.

47:21.717 --> 47:24.970
Always behind me.
Your father always behind you.

47:27.723 --> 47:28.807
Paris.

47:35.105 --> 47:36.273
Jasmine.

47:41.737 --> 47:43.530
Burnt sage.

47:52.039 --> 47:56.126
Rain across the meadows.

47:58.879 --> 48:01.173
Thank you, Your Majesty.

48:05.844 --> 48:11.558
I had heard that the Pennsan Scent Chefs
were among the best in the land.

48:12.726 --> 48:14.561
And now I know it to be true.

48:16.104 --> 48:19.816
I hope you all enjoyed the performance.

48:21.527 --> 48:25.822
I've learned
that even in our darkest hours,

48:26.406 --> 48:30.285
we must find time
to appreciate the beauty and joy

48:30.369 --> 48:32.579
with which the God Flame blesses us.

48:32.663 --> 48:36.583
Even now,
with the struggle that lies ahead,

48:37.167 --> 48:38.836
there is beauty to be found.

48:40.003 --> 48:42.840
There is love.

48:44.341 --> 48:46.385
And so it is with great joy

48:46.468 --> 48:49.638
that I share with you,
the esteemed members of my court,

48:50.138 --> 48:55.853
that my sister, Princess Maghra Kane,
has been betrothed

48:56.353 --> 49:01.400
to none other than your very own
Lord Harlan of Pennsa.

49:02.776 --> 49:05.112
I thought we were going to announce this.

49:05.195 --> 49:06.655
Yeah, I thought so too.

49:06.738 --> 49:09.366
And we will all bear witness
to their marriage

49:10.200 --> 49:13.036
on the fourth God Flame rising from today.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.123
We are Payan

49:16.206 --> 49:18.166
-Were you part of this?
-No.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.293
We are holy

49:19.376 --> 49:21.003
I'm not sure I believe you.

49:21.503 --> 49:25.424
Well, Princess, at some point,
you're gonna have to trust me.

49:26.425 --> 49:28.218
You better give me a reason to.

49:28.302 --> 49:30.762
We are chosen

49:37.394 --> 49:38.604
Father.

49:41.690 --> 49:42.774
What is it?

49:43.275 --> 49:44.526
The general is here.

49:45.944 --> 49:46.945
What?

49:48.697 --> 49:49.948
Edo Voss is here?

49:50.532 --> 49:53.285
He just arrived with some soldiers.

49:57.039 --> 49:59.374
He must not know that I am compromised.

50:05.422 --> 50:08.884
General Voss. This is quite a surprise.

50:09.843 --> 50:10.928
Really?

50:14.723 --> 50:16.642
I half thought you'd be expecting me.

50:18.602 --> 50:19.603
And why's that?

50:25.025 --> 50:29.488
Someone walked into my prison
and walked out with Baba Voss.

50:31.365 --> 50:32.908
You captured Baba Voss?

50:35.077 --> 50:36.078
We had him.

50:37.955 --> 50:39.206
Until we didn't.

50:40.541 --> 50:43.210
It's no small thing
to outmaneuver the guards

50:43.710 --> 50:46.505
and navigate passages
of a Trivantian prison

50:47.756 --> 50:51.844
unless one has the gift of sight.

50:53.345 --> 50:58.183
And you are accusing me?
Why in the world would I free Baba Voss?

50:58.267 --> 50:59.434
Where's the son?

51:01.061 --> 51:02.062
The son?

51:03.313 --> 51:06.316
The son you refused to send
with my men when they were here.

51:06.650 --> 51:08.694
-I'd like him now.
-Listen to me.

51:08.777 --> 51:11.488
The trap you set brought
Baba Voss to my door.

51:11.572 --> 51:14.992
He killed my guards
and took my son by force.

51:15.742 --> 51:18.287
Baba Voss was here and he left you alive?

51:20.038 --> 51:22.457
Even after you gave away his daughter?

51:25.002 --> 51:26.336
He had no choice. He was outnumbered.

51:29.464 --> 51:31.925
What is this? What is this?

51:32.009 --> 51:38.140
And why does the boy answer
when I am speaking to the father?

51:39.516 --> 51:42.853
And why aren't you moving
around like you usually do when we meet,

51:43.854 --> 51:45.480
to lord your gift over me?

51:47.482 --> 51:48.984
It's almost as if--

51:49.067 --> 51:51.403
Listen, General,
if you came all this way, just--

51:52.404 --> 51:54.615
Let him go! Let him go.

51:54.698 --> 51:57.034
-General.
-Quiet.

52:12.424 --> 52:13.842
He took your sight.

52:15.719 --> 52:17.221
A temporary injury.

52:17.971 --> 52:20.307
One that will soon be healed.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.521
No.

52:28.398 --> 52:29.483
It will not.

52:33.028 --> 52:34.404
No!

52:34.488 --> 52:36.615
No! No!

52:37.115 --> 52:40.118
No! No!

52:41.161 --> 52:45.332
I will kill you.
I swear to God, I will kill you.

52:46.708 --> 52:48.460
Put aside your grief, Oloman.

52:49.711 --> 52:52.506
It falls on you now
to protect the rest of your family.

52:53.090 --> 52:56.385
To do that, you'll need a clear head.

52:57.302 --> 52:59.596
This house belongs to me now.

53:00.514 --> 53:04.226
You, the books, the knowledge, all of it.

53:05.519 --> 53:06.562
Tormada!

53:15.362 --> 53:19.116
This is Tormada.
He's one of our greatest scientists.

53:21.577 --> 53:22.870
You work for him now.
