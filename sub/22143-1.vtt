- WOMAN: Yummy.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.993
...it just happened for us.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.472
I saw her, and I knew she was the woman

22:01.600 --> 22:03.353
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

You guys understand that kind
of connection, right?

22:27.960 --> 22:29.076
You must.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.873
I mean, you're both so different.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.838
It must have been what pulled you together.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.676
Why not finish breakfast and get to it?

23:13.880 --> 23:17.271
Well, I want to finish the house,

23:17.360 --> 23:20.797
and he's working on a new piece.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.400
Oh, so you're writing again?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.036

You're more than welcome
to stay here as long as you want.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.159
Honey, they've got plenty of room.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.390
Speaking of kids, do you have a phone?

No, it's all right.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.116
(SIGHS) Can we just relax for the weekend?

to let him know we're okay.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.636
Just a quick call.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.880
What's wrong?

24:02.560 --> 24:04.950
Why would you do that without asking me?

24:05.640 --> 24:08.394
- Do what?
- Invite them to stay.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.512
I didn't think it was a big deal.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.236
- It's strange.
- What?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.073
Did you know he had a wife?

24:22.560 --> 24:23.914
What about your writing?

24:26.600 --> 24:29.957
I was actually enjoying
not thinking about it.

24:31.560 --> 24:36.034
But now that I am thinking about it,
I should go and do something about it.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.635

I really should work.

- How's your hand?
- Mmm.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.871
- Still stinging.
- I'm sorry.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.873
It's not like it was your fault.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.872
You don't have any painkillers, do you?

25:51.880 --> 25:53.792
Are you telling me the truth?

25:54.520 --> 25:56.352
I really don't have any. I'm sorry.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.115
Okay.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.193

26:02.280 --> 26:03.396
Right.

(GROANS SOFTLY)

26:14.680 --> 26:16.160

26:16.600 --> 26:19.160
- It's strong.
- I'm on my second.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.471
I can't believe you did
all this work yourself.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.396
- Why not?
- It's a lot.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.080
Well, we spend all our time here.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.879
I want to make it paradise.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.713

You're welcome.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.274
Well, where to begin?

27:04.160 --> 27:06.550
Well, this was the hardest part.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.472
There was so much damage.
The treads were gone,

27:08.560 --> 27:10.313
the railing, even the skylight.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.756
So I had to get a lot of new material,
but I tried to save as much...

27:12.880 --> 27:15.076
Isn't it a lot harder
than just starting fresh?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.554
How do you mean?

27:16.920 --> 27:19.389
Why didn't you just build a new house?

27:20.480 --> 27:21.709
Well, it's...

27:22.080 --> 27:23.434
It's his home.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.240
Oh...

27:27.240 --> 27:28.913
You really love him.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.634
Can I ask you a question?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.320
Why don't you want kids?

27:37.400 --> 27:38.436
Excuse me?

27:38.520 --> 27:39.749
(CHUCKLES)

27:41.440 --> 27:43.796
I saw how you reacted earlier.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.110
I know what it's like
when you're just starting out,

27:47.240 --> 27:49.800
and you think you have
all the time in the world.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.752
You know, you're not going
to be so young forever.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.440

- Then why did he say...

28:30.320 --> 28:31.310
I'm sorry.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.791
Was I too forward? I do that sometimes.

being in there without him!

have to try harder than this.

you got to keep it interesting.

I mean, look at you.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.000
If he's not all over you,

30:24.080 --> 30:26.470
it's either because of his age or...

30:30.120 --> 30:31.110
Or what?

30:35.240 --> 30:36.913
You know what? Forget it.

No, it's okay. Say what you were gonna say.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.070
No, seriously. No, obviously
he still loves you.
