01:16.838 --> 01:18.148
Hey, little lady.

01:18.236 --> 01:20.627
You'd be a lot prettier
if you smiled.

01:20.775 --> 01:22.431
What?
Who are you?

01:22.525 --> 01:23.742
I'm a man.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.476
So I know what
I'm talking about.

01:25.564 --> 01:27.875
Smile and you'll be a lot
more popular.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.062
Are you serious?

01:29.150 --> 01:31.304
You know I'll remember this
forever, right?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.713
Well, that's what
therapy's for.

01:33.947 --> 01:36.067
And he told me
I wouldn't be pretty

01:36.155 --> 01:37.478
unless I smiled.

01:37.626 --> 01:39.836
Sweetie, you are
<i><font color=#ffff00>very</font></i> pretty.

01:39.924 --> 01:41.523
And thanks
to the puberty app

01:41.611 --> 01:42.760
on my phone,
we can see

01:42.848 --> 01:43.926
what lies ahead.

01:54.129 --> 01:55.711
Wait.
This can't be real.

01:55.799 --> 01:57.299
I already had
braces.

01:57.387 --> 02:00.775
Oh. Well, I-I'm afraid
you have to get them again.

02:00.863 --> 02:03.153
The man we thought was
your orthodontist

02:03.241 --> 02:06.510
was actually
a rogue periodontist.

02:07.775 --> 02:09.360
Rogue periodontist.

02:09.449 --> 02:11.588
This family cheaps out
on everything.

02:11.697 --> 02:14.635
Homer took me
to a "psychiatrist."

02:14.723 --> 02:16.502
After three sessions,
I figured out

02:16.590 --> 02:18.275
it was a goat
with glasses.

02:18.363 --> 02:20.361
Never went
b-a-a-a-ck.

02:22.063 --> 02:24.080
Braces?
Again?

02:24.179 --> 02:26.466
Why am I, the only one
in this family

02:26.554 --> 02:28.031
who needs
braces?

02:33.719 --> 02:35.084
Don't look so smug,
boy.

02:35.172 --> 02:36.992
Let's try this app
on you.

02:38.004 --> 02:40.883
Hello, Aaron Eckhart.
Prrrrr!

02:41.343 --> 02:43.383
Whoa-ho!
Puberty!

02:43.471 --> 02:44.937
Let's see what comes next.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.022
Cool.

02:47.171 --> 02:49.804
Homie, look.
We got this in the mail today.

02:49.892 --> 02:51.109
Aw, what is it?

02:51.250 --> 02:53.034
Did I get drunk
and buy useless stuff

02:53.122 --> 02:54.445
on eBay again?

02:54.828 --> 02:56.219
Let's get more.

02:58.397 --> 02:59.537
Hello, Simpsons.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.703
It's me,
Artie Ziff,

03:01.798 --> 03:04.238
in pre-recorded
form.

03:04.326 --> 03:06.140
So you can't
talk to me.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.234
I can't?

03:07.322 --> 03:08.903
No, you can't.

03:08.991 --> 03:10.961
Pause for laughs.

03:11.049 --> 03:12.297
And thank you.

03:12.385 --> 03:14.250
Artie Ziff?
Isn't that the rich guy

03:14.338 --> 03:15.609
who could have been
our dad?

03:15.697 --> 03:18.625
I am the only man
your mother has ever been with,

03:18.713 --> 03:20.851
and she doesn't have
a single regret.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.976
- Well...
- You stay out of this, Marge!

03:23.064 --> 03:26.133
Great news: I'm getting married,
and you're invited!

03:26.237 --> 03:29.133
- Oh.
- Why, you ask, am <i> I</i> getting married?

03:29.243 --> 03:32.070
I've found
my <font color=#ffff00>soul</font> mate!

03:32.487 --> 03:34.078
Jealous?

03:35.002 --> 03:36.979
April 12th,
very rich man's wedding.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.164
Regrets only.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.344
Chicken or fish.

03:39.432 --> 03:40.773
Or vegan.

03:40.868 --> 03:42.140
Bye!

03:42.249 --> 03:43.594
So, what else is in the mail?

03:43.690 --> 03:46.554
We got a flyer
from Lowe's!

03:47.109 --> 03:48.969
Three-quarter plywood.

03:49.057 --> 03:50.797
$20 a sheet!

03:50.917 --> 03:52.351
I'm a-comin'!

03:52.446 --> 03:54.547
Oh,
I don't have a car.

03:55.265 --> 03:57.240
You're not really thinking
of going, are you?

03:57.328 --> 03:59.334
That jerk kept trying
to break us up.

03:59.422 --> 04:02.531
Now,
I am sensing conflicted feelings.

04:02.619 --> 04:04.810
If you come,
I promise you

04:04.898 --> 04:06.320
a wonderful time.

04:06.408 --> 04:08.164
Champagne, caviar,

04:08.252 --> 04:11.039
deep-fried ice sculptures,
a guy who guesses your weight,

04:11.127 --> 04:13.179
who always guesses low!

04:15.195 --> 04:16.218
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:16.305 --> 04:19.678
<i>And now to celebrate,
here's Tupac Shakur!</i>

04:19.767 --> 04:21.140
<i>♪ Don't be tardy ♪</i>

04:21.228 --> 04:23.523

04:23.618 --> 04:25.526

04:25.696 --> 04:28.270
<i>♪ Why won't you people

04:28.358 --> 04:29.807
How do you turn this off?

04:29.895 --> 04:32.088
<i>There's no off
to the Artie show.</i>

04:32.176 --> 04:34.833
<i>- I decide when...
- Please set me free.</i>

04:34.958 --> 04:36.080
Oh, here it is.

04:36.168 --> 04:37.596
<i>God bless you.</i>

04:43.943 --> 04:46.768
Now everyone's favorite:
Rinse and spit.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.453
And I'm done...
with the top braces.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.237
We'll put the bottoms in
next week.

04:53.325 --> 04:55.284
And after that,
just a lifetime

04:55.371 --> 04:56.698
of wearing retainers.

04:56.786 --> 04:58.535
Well, they're practically
invisible.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.815
I can't close
my mouth.

05:00.903 --> 05:03.127
The brackets are holding up
your lips at the edges.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.760
They'll adjust.
The main thing is you're happy.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.440
I'm not happy.

05:07.528 --> 05:09.088
Have a little nitrous.

05:10.529 --> 05:14.065
Oh, they should revoke
your license. Ha!

05:14.153 --> 05:15.164
More, please.

05:15.252 --> 05:17.237
- That's enough.
- No, it's not!

05:17.659 --> 05:18.721
Yeah, give me that.

05:18.809 --> 05:21.341
I thought your name is
"Kidzrule."

05:21.429 --> 05:23.604
Shortened from
"Kidzrulovitch,"

05:23.692 --> 05:26.573
which is Romanian for
"kill all the children."

05:35.530 --> 05:36.698
Hmm.

05:36.786 --> 05:39.651
That elevator has the capacity
for 32 people!

05:40.049 --> 05:42.596
We brought a rhino
up here last week.

05:42.684 --> 05:44.284
Hmm.

05:44.466 --> 05:45.897
Hmm.

05:46.255 --> 05:49.412
- Hmm!
- My headaches are so bad.

05:56.159 --> 05:57.506
Jealous?

06:00.776 --> 06:01.912
Feet.

06:02.137 --> 06:03.537
You're one in a million.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.639
Literally.
Don't fall off the roof.

06:05.827 --> 06:07.333
Homer Simpson!

06:07.421 --> 06:09.967
The man who beat me
to planet Marge.

06:10.055 --> 06:11.970
You've done all right
for a billionaire.

06:12.079 --> 06:13.975
Hey,
I'm not made of money.

06:14.063 --> 06:15.561
Although, actually
I am.

06:15.649 --> 06:17.301
After my parole,
I got rich

06:17.389 --> 06:20.147
selling fireplace logs
that look like cash,

06:20.235 --> 06:22.569
i.e., Money to Burn.

06:23.318 --> 06:24.865
That is the greatest.

06:24.953 --> 06:26.367
It says
"Money to Burn."

06:26.455 --> 06:28.483
It looks like
you're burning money!

06:28.571 --> 06:29.795
Yes, that's the idea.

06:30.313 --> 06:31.578
No, no, no.

06:31.666 --> 06:33.764
It's so funny.
Don't you get it?

06:33.852 --> 06:35.405
Of course get it.
I thought of it.

06:35.493 --> 06:38.358
No, no, no.
Listen, it says "Money to Burn,"

06:38.446 --> 06:40.217
but it's actually...

06:40.453 --> 06:42.961
I know! I know!
Talk to someone else.

06:43.049 --> 06:45.553
Hey, pal, you're a news guy.
Give it to me straight.

06:45.641 --> 06:47.312
Is this wedding
on the level?

06:47.400 --> 06:49.328
Here's the scoop.
It's legit!

06:49.416 --> 06:51.300
In other news,
local newsman hopes

06:51.388 --> 06:53.302
to score with caterer.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.904
This just in:
she knows I'm married.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.920
Coming up at 11:00:
nothing.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.558
Now, Homer,
as this is a bachelor party,

07:00.646 --> 07:01.881
I want to show you
something.

07:01.969 --> 07:04.545
But, uh,
no word to the wives.

07:04.699 --> 07:06.506
How did you meet your wife,
by the way?

07:06.632 --> 07:09.724
Usual: boy meets girl,
girl meets bank account.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.474
Now, shut your eyes.

07:11.562 --> 07:14.353
You've never seen a body
this enticing.

07:14.465 --> 07:17.146
Oh! Exactly
what I imagined!

07:19.482 --> 07:21.083
Food coma.
He'll be fine.

07:21.645 --> 07:22.968
Huh?

07:23.485 --> 07:24.966
Hmm.

07:29.466 --> 07:30.911
Hey, girlfriend!

07:30.999 --> 07:32.771
Uh, who, me?

07:32.859 --> 07:35.659
Lisa, did you get
your eyebrows waxed?

07:35.752 --> 07:37.403
You look amazing!

07:37.572 --> 07:39.091
I don't have
eyebrows.

07:39.179 --> 07:41.685
Well, check out
these twin caterpillars.

07:41.773 --> 07:43.161
Huh? Huh?

07:43.249 --> 07:44.771
What's going on?

07:44.929 --> 07:47.161
Her smile makes me feel
full,

07:47.249 --> 07:49.575
like I actually ate dinner
last night.

07:49.663 --> 07:52.169
If you never eat,
how come you're so fat?

07:52.257 --> 07:53.333
-Ooh!
- Ow!

07:53.452 --> 07:55.669
Americans can be fat
<i><font color=#ffff00>and</font></i> poor.

07:55.757 --> 07:57.685
That's what makes us
so great.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.927
And so,
after saving Wilbur,

08:01.015 --> 08:03.263
Charlotte crawled off
to die,

08:03.353 --> 08:07.731
as all barn spiders do
in the fall.

08:10.337 --> 08:11.466
Bravo, Lisa.

08:11.554 --> 08:14.333
What a positive note
on which to end the class.

08:14.872 --> 08:16.997
Positive?
Positive?

08:17.085 --> 08:20.841
Charlotte died alone
at the saddest place on Earth,

08:20.929 --> 08:22.997
an empty fairground.

08:23.118 --> 08:26.192
Well, your smiling face
made dying alone fun.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.833
And believe me,
that's where I'm headed.

08:28.921 --> 08:30.669
So as long as
I'm smiling,

08:30.757 --> 08:33.005
it doesn't matter
what comes out of my mouth?

08:33.092 --> 08:34.457
Or your nose.

08:38.219 --> 08:40.200
I don't need these
anymore.

08:42.011 --> 08:44.310
This'll go good
in Willie's stew.

08:46.060 --> 08:48.810
<i>Can it really be
that people are this shallow?</i>

08:48.996 --> 08:52.466
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

08:52.554 --> 08:55.427
<i>And am I shallow enough
to enjoy this?</i>

08:55.535 --> 08:57.396
<i>Ah! I am!</i>

08:58.784 --> 09:01.622
I'm so happy,
I could sing!

09:02.984 --> 09:05.442
♪ Hello, world! ♪

09:05.530 --> 09:06.981
Ow, ow, ow.

09:07.069 --> 09:09.099
That really hurts
with the braces.

09:10.108 --> 09:12.177
- Take your pick.
- What is it?

09:12.265 --> 09:14.790
No idea.
The labels are in Spanish.

09:21.244 --> 09:22.974
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey, Bart.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.989
Lisa? Oh, yuck!
I didn't know that was you.

09:27.418 --> 09:28.495
It's the smile.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.014
It's totally changed
how people see me.

09:31.102 --> 09:32.676
Well, I just want you
to know,

09:32.778 --> 09:34.262
you'll always be gross
to me.

09:34.349 --> 09:36.339
Oh, thank God.
I was having doubts,

09:36.426 --> 09:38.309
trying to figure out
if this is sexist.

09:38.397 --> 09:40.640
And then
I found this.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.356
It seems like
ever since the pill,

09:52.444 --> 09:54.997
the workplace has been
full of single women.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.848
Here's your coffee,
Jim.

09:56.936 --> 09:59.702
Extra sugar,
just how you like it.

09:59.923 --> 10:02.450
Hmm.
Remind me to get a divorce.

10:02.674 --> 10:05.948
But some women are
having trouble "fitting in."

10:06.175 --> 10:07.958
Well, I can't figure it out,
Jim.

10:08.046 --> 10:10.297
I was all prepared
for a big presentation,

10:10.366 --> 10:13.020
but it went over
like a nun at a go-go bar.

10:13.108 --> 10:15.004
Well, there's one thing
you didn't prepare,

10:15.092 --> 10:16.270
and that's your face.

10:16.358 --> 10:18.653
But I'm wearing a pound
of Mary Kay.

10:18.741 --> 10:20.942
Let me touch your body
and show you the problem.

10:21.030 --> 10:22.301
No need to ask.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.559
Mm.

10:23.779 --> 10:25.520
You've got
a secret weapon

10:25.608 --> 10:27.615
sitting in the middle
of your face.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.778
Now you're sure
to get that promotion.

10:29.866 --> 10:31.231
Really?

10:32.073 --> 10:33.200
No.

10:33.668 --> 10:36.020
Ugh! Don't you see
why I hate this?

10:36.108 --> 10:37.379
'Cause you hate everything?

10:37.467 --> 10:40.734
Because it makes
that jerky old guy right!

10:40.822 --> 10:43.317
I <i> am</i> more popular
because I'm smiling.

10:43.492 --> 10:44.801
Told ya!

10:54.187 --> 10:57.043
Wow. Not a single picture
of Artie.

10:57.131 --> 10:58.989
Maybe
he <i> has</i> matured.

11:01.753 --> 11:04.230
Well, I guess being here
sort of ends

11:04.318 --> 11:05.536
a chapter
in my life.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.372
So, lehayim.

11:09.214 --> 11:10.700
That's odd.

11:10.788 --> 11:13.556
Not one person
from the bride's family.

11:18.191 --> 11:19.762
Excuse me.
We need someone

11:19.850 --> 11:21.245
to walk the bride
down the aisle.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.354
- Could you?
- First, tell me one thing:

11:23.442 --> 11:24.606
How long is the aisle?

11:24.694 --> 11:26.092
About 20 feet.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.364
All right, I'll do it.

11:27.452 --> 11:29.369
But double cake.

11:33.004 --> 11:34.884
They grow up so fast.

11:34.972 --> 11:37.106
I knew this day
would come.

11:37.699 --> 11:41.075
You'll always be
my little girl. Mm.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.786
If he ever hurts my baby,
I'll kill him.

11:43.874 --> 11:45.872
Oh, for crying out
loud.

11:45.967 --> 11:47.918
Friends, family,

11:48.006 --> 11:50.309
I take great delight
in informing you

11:50.397 --> 11:52.754
that the bride and groom
have written their own vows.

11:54.373 --> 11:57.700
Stick to the script,
amateurs!

12:01.812 --> 12:02.950
Oh, my God.

12:03.038 --> 12:04.325
This is too weird.

12:04.413 --> 12:06.950
Artie, you are
the greatest lover ever.

12:07.043 --> 12:09.809
When we make sex,
it is so, so good.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.426
I can't take this anymore.
We're getting out of here.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.895
Yeah. This is really creepy.

12:14.983 --> 12:16.895
Even the rhino's leaving.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.817
You may now
kiss the bride.

12:25.643 --> 12:27.840
And this is a picture of us
at our wedding.

12:27.928 --> 12:29.269
You're so happy.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.028
And here's us
on our honeymoon.

12:31.116 --> 12:33.528
Two days in Ohio,
two days in Michigan,

12:33.616 --> 12:35.772
and, booyah,
up to Ontario

12:35.860 --> 12:38.513
for some
international flavor.

12:39.421 --> 12:40.879
I'm not happy.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.716
I have a drawing of
you saying that in Michigan.

12:43.836 --> 12:45.693
This smile is
so wrong.

12:45.781 --> 12:47.325
There's nothing
to be happy about.

12:47.413 --> 12:50.387
The world is a mess,
and so is this school.

12:51.299 --> 12:53.264
I mean, how hard is this?

12:53.421 --> 12:56.333
The happy girl put the thing
in the hole!

13:01.302 --> 13:02.333
Wait a minute.

13:02.429 --> 13:04.205
I could use
my new power

13:04.293 --> 13:05.787
to change
these things,

13:05.875 --> 13:07.364
use it for
good.

13:21.075 --> 13:22.590
Indubitably.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.135
- Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

13:25.223 --> 13:26.887
I can make it happen.

13:27.323 --> 13:28.918
Hurry!

13:36.168 --> 13:37.424
You posers.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.817
I was for Lisa
before it was cool.

13:39.926 --> 13:41.473
You never liked
Lisa.

13:41.576 --> 13:43.315
What?
You got to remember <i> <font color=#ffff00>that.</font></i>

13:43.403 --> 13:45.122
That's my
one thing!

13:45.210 --> 13:48.082
No. Your thing is
crying when you're punched.

13:48.170 --> 13:49.184
Prove it.

13:49.302 --> 13:50.575
- Ow!
- Aw! Ho!

13:52.037 --> 13:54.613
Aw, you're taking
all the fun out of it.

13:54.973 --> 13:56.636
The polls are in,
and you're doing great.

13:56.724 --> 13:59.354
You're picking up the key group:
girls who don't like Milhouse.

13:59.442 --> 14:00.707
You're big
with swing voters,

14:00.795 --> 14:02.668
but the teeter-totters
could go either way.

14:02.756 --> 14:04.252
What about the kids
on the slide?

14:04.340 --> 14:05.418
Eh, they're up and down,

14:05.506 --> 14:07.270
but the kids on the monkey bars
are climbing.

14:07.358 --> 14:08.379
That's all I got.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.715
Like every election
with one week to go,

14:10.803 --> 14:12.145
this is in the bag.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.434
Don't be so sure.

14:13.522 --> 14:15.338
I'm up against
a tough opponent:

14:15.489 --> 14:17.145
Dubya Spuckler.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.629
Look at this negative ad he did.

14:19.838 --> 14:22.582
<i>Lisa Simpson says "writin'"
ends with a "G"</i>

14:22.670 --> 14:25.168
<i>and "'rithmetic"
starts with a "A."</i>

14:25.279 --> 14:27.047
<i>You know what I say?</i>

14:29.619 --> 14:32.223
Don't worry.
You just keep smiling.

14:32.311 --> 14:34.666
Well, I do have an orthodontist
appointment

14:34.754 --> 14:36.059
tomorrow
for a tune-up.

14:36.147 --> 14:38.437
In the bag,
Madam President.

14:38.525 --> 14:40.357
Bup,
don't be so sure.

14:40.445 --> 14:43.139
Hey, I drew a picture
of your inauguration.

14:43.436 --> 14:46.529
I don't think
I've ever looked more radiant.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.811
Okay, kid.
Your bottom braces are on.

14:54.199 --> 14:56.917
What happened
to my smile?

14:57.747 --> 14:59.576
No, no, no,
this is terrible.

14:59.664 --> 15:01.381
I look like
I actually feel.

15:01.469 --> 15:03.686
In six months,
you'll have perfect teeth.

15:03.774 --> 15:06.748
Six months?
I have to smile now.

15:06.836 --> 15:08.717
No, I can power
through this.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.287
Ow. Ow.

15:11.651 --> 15:14.400
Uh, Ralph lost his retainer
in the trash.

15:14.488 --> 15:16.048
What can we, uh,
do here?

15:16.136 --> 15:18.084
New ones are $500.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.943
Uh, so just what is
this secret mission, Chief?

15:21.031 --> 15:23.983
Well, let's just say
you're on retainer.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.170
Let's see.
I'll take this.

15:35.258 --> 15:36.911
Aw, stop that.

15:37.044 --> 15:40.068
Aw, come on, Marge.
This minibar is paid for.

15:40.156 --> 15:43.045
Do you know the street value
of this Toblerone?

15:43.928 --> 15:45.248
Homer, stop it.

15:45.336 --> 15:47.877
I can't help thinking about
that poor woman.

15:47.965 --> 15:51.186
Artie only married her
because she looks like me.

15:51.392 --> 15:52.889
I mean,
a lot like me.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.975
You're right.
We have to find her and tell her.

15:55.063 --> 15:57.390
But, first,
there's something naughty

15:57.478 --> 15:59.478
I want to do
\with this bed.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.529
Are you sure we should be here?

16:08.617 --> 16:10.373
This is technically
his honeymoon.

16:10.461 --> 16:13.335
Achm! Achm! Achm!

16:15.657 --> 16:16.740
Artie?

16:16.828 --> 16:19.350
I'm at the lowest point
of my life!

16:19.556 --> 16:20.873
But come on in.

16:23.403 --> 16:25.803
As a woman,
I just want to tell your wife

16:25.891 --> 16:27.714
what's really going on
here.

16:27.802 --> 16:29.193
Sure, why not?

16:29.351 --> 16:31.477
Say it to her face!

16:32.721 --> 16:34.180
Now you know
my secret.

16:34.268 --> 16:36.701
I've spent years trying
to build the perfect copy

16:36.789 --> 16:39.623
of the only woman for me:
you, Marge.

16:41.998 --> 16:44.756
But they were all inferior
in some way.

16:45.225 --> 16:46.861
This one lacks kindness.

16:46.948 --> 16:48.584
This one keeps trying
to kill me.

16:48.672 --> 16:50.490
This one's head
is a toaster!

16:50.578 --> 16:53.787
And the slots aren't even
big enough for a bagel!

16:54.045 --> 16:56.318
Why would you marry
a machine?

16:56.406 --> 16:57.717
I didn't.

16:57.868 --> 16:59.524
It was one last
<font color=#ffff00>trick.</font>

16:59.682 --> 17:01.856
I thought when you saw
how perfect we look together,

17:01.906 --> 17:04.412
you would realize
that we were meant to be.

17:04.500 --> 17:08.521
I am, as the poet once said,
a dumb schmuck.

17:08.753 --> 17:10.310
- Artie.
- Yes?

17:10.469 --> 17:12.373
You're not dumb.
You're smart.

17:12.461 --> 17:14.185
And I think
this crazy project

17:14.295 --> 17:16.178
actually had
some brilliance in it.

17:16.266 --> 17:19.875
Imagine if you use
that noodle for good.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.053
Wow. Wow.

17:22.203 --> 17:23.896
Only you could find
a pearl

17:23.983 --> 17:26.529
in the flabby oyster
that is me.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.811
I <i> <font color=#ffff00>will</font></i> become
a better human being.

17:28.899 --> 17:30.076
Terrific.

17:30.164 --> 17:32.221
And then
you'll love me?

17:32.309 --> 17:33.553
No.

17:33.642 --> 17:36.787
Well, then,
I finally give up.

17:37.210 --> 17:38.850
Or do I?

17:40.241 --> 17:41.990
Aw, damn it.

17:42.936 --> 17:46.412
Artie, you and your blue crew
of Margekateers

17:46.500 --> 17:48.156
have done
so many good deeds.

17:48.244 --> 17:49.264
What's next?

17:49.352 --> 17:51.326
I'm gonna make one of them
my bride.

17:52.532 --> 17:54.295
Hey, I didn't give you
wings.

17:54.383 --> 17:55.990
Life finds a way!

17:58.705 --> 18:00.600
Uh, let's quiet down,
please.

18:00.695 --> 18:02.232
The sooner we can get this
debate over,

18:02.320 --> 18:03.997
the sooner the teachers
can get ice cream.

18:04.085 --> 18:05.403
Boo!

18:05.491 --> 18:07.949
None for Seymour.
He gets gassy.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.419
Yeah, I-I know.

18:09.521 --> 18:12.678
And now we have
a very special moderator,

18:12.766 --> 18:14.912
Governor Mary Bailey.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.302
Our first candidate is
Dubya Spuckler.

18:18.443 --> 18:20.928
Dubya! Dubya!

18:21.039 --> 18:22.193
That's your brother.

18:22.281 --> 18:24.232
He prefers
he pronoun "they,"

18:24.320 --> 18:27.381
on account of the twin
he absorbed in my belly.

18:27.472 --> 18:30.490
Our other candidate is ill,
so she'll be Skyping in.

18:30.578 --> 18:31.701
Lisa Simpson.

18:31.789 --> 18:34.188
Lisa, I'm sorry,
what do you have?

18:34.346 --> 18:37.075
<i>What I have is
an agenda for this school,</i>

18:37.170 --> 18:39.232
<i>an agenda
that looks forward.</i>

18:39.320 --> 18:42.186
<i>I can deliver results,
while my opponent</i>

18:42.274 --> 18:44.240
<i>can't even spell
"results."</i>

18:44.445 --> 18:47.631
Yes, I can.
R-E squiggly letter,

18:47.735 --> 18:49.170
bucket letter, tall man,

18:49.258 --> 18:50.889
little plus sign,
squiggly letter.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.029
"Results."

18:52.117 --> 18:53.887
<i>That's not how
you spell "results."</i>

18:53.975 --> 18:56.679
Lisa doesn't sound
sick at all.

18:58.517 --> 19:00.646
You said
you've done this before.

19:00.734 --> 19:03.271
It was
my machismo talking.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.194
- Ooooh! - Ooooh!
- Ooooh! - Ooooh!

19:09.281 --> 19:12.953
Aah!
Lisa's using a funny-face app.

19:17.578 --> 19:20.133
Listen, I tried to fool you,
and that was wrong.

19:20.221 --> 19:22.286
This is an
abomination!

19:22.374 --> 19:24.086
What are you doing
at a school debate?

19:24.213 --> 19:27.359
My illegitimate son
goes here.

19:28.031 --> 19:29.727
Oh, the shame.

19:29.852 --> 19:31.750
I still have
good ideas.

19:31.857 --> 19:34.440
All I hear is
"nag, nag, nag."

19:34.566 --> 19:36.889
Dubya! Dubya!

19:37.054 --> 19:39.648
Dubya! Dubya!

19:40.312 --> 19:42.336
Oh, boy.

19:42.630 --> 19:44.508
I didn't want to believe
my popularity

19:44.596 --> 19:46.937
was based
on my stupid smile.

19:47.081 --> 19:49.070
Oh, but it was.

19:49.158 --> 19:51.315
You're just a kid,
and things are changing.

19:51.469 --> 19:53.476
In the future,
women will be judged

19:53.564 --> 19:55.641
by what they say,
not how they look.

19:55.729 --> 19:59.875
Maybe, but the future is
a really long way away.

20:00.140 --> 20:02.109
Told you
you should smile more.

20:02.697 --> 20:04.906
The future is now!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.594
Oh! Wow!

20:10.687 --> 20:11.836
A toast.

20:11.923 --> 20:13.648
I have finally
perfected you.

20:13.736 --> 20:16.516
You all look just like Marge,
and you will never leave.

20:16.604 --> 20:20.633
Now, which of you lucky girls
wants to party with Arty?

20:21.678 --> 20:25.336
I am in power save mode.

20:25.469 --> 20:27.758
Oh, fine.
What about you two?

20:27.846 --> 20:29.210
Power save.

20:29.298 --> 20:31.505
One percent battery.

20:31.593 --> 20:32.789
Hmm?

20:32.877 --> 20:34.578
I just don't like you.

20:36.475 --> 20:38.469
Oh!
That counts as a kiss.
