00:02.135 --> 00:05.935
<i>Surgeons aren't</i>
<i>known for being warm and cuddly.</i>

00:05.971 --> 00:08.497
<i>They're arrogant, impatient,</i>

00:08.541 --> 00:11.442
- <i>mean, as often as not.</i>
- Go with straight-up chemo

00:11.478 --> 00:15.539
and immunotherapy. Survival rates are
low, but there's been a lot of success

00:15.615 --> 00:19.483
with mestastasectomies.
We could probably cut this thing out.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.545
<i>You'd think they wouldn't have friends.</i>
<i>Who could stand them?</i>

00:22.622 --> 00:25.853
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing. It's just work stuff.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.860
- What is that? A cool surgery?
- No, it's nothing. It's nothing.

00:28.928 --> 00:33.024
Whatever it is, they'll pick me. I flew
solo. You're still on training wheels.

00:35.935 --> 00:39.029
- Sure you still don't wanna tell him?
- Yes, I'm sure.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.667
OK. Look, I researched a ton
of information. Read all of this

00:42.709 --> 00:44.404
- before you see the oncologist.
- When?

00:44.444 --> 00:48.346
I called Dr. Golding.
He gave me a referral to Swender.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.043
- I'm gonna try and get you in today.
- Shh!

00:51.084 --> 00:53.450
What are you doing here?
I told you I was fine.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.353
- You are so not fine.
- I'd be fine if I knew Derek was fine.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.983
You still haven't heard from him?
No word?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.730
Izzie, don't you think
you should call in sick today?

01:06.766 --> 01:09.360
- What? Why?
- Because this is a lot of reading,

01:09.402 --> 01:12.667
- and you're sick.
- You coming? Big surgery today.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.639
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Izzie, just...

01:15.875 --> 01:19.436
<i>But surgeons are like a bad cold:</i>

01:19.479 --> 01:22.073
<i>Nasty, but persistent.</i>

01:22.115 --> 01:27.314
- Uh, Chief, I need to ask you about...
- Sloan, have you heard from Derek?

01:28.188 --> 01:29.212
No.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.184
I'm sorry. You were saying?
Oh, Meredith.

01:33.726 --> 01:37.184
No, I don't know how he is. I've heard
nothing. Nothing today, nothing

01:37.230 --> 01:41.564
yesterday, nothing the day before.
And no, I will not go back out there.

01:44.137 --> 01:48.198
Hey, who moved my surgery?
Chief? Chief?

01:48.241 --> 01:53.269
Don't. Just don't. He's a wreck.
He's disintegrating before our eyes.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.749
- That's why men die earlier than women.
- Mm. The board's a mess.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.947
He can't lose Shepherd.
I'd go talk some sense into him,

02:00.987 --> 02:04.218
- but I've got too much on my plate.
- Tried calling?

02:04.257 --> 02:05.281
About 100 times.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.656
Mm.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.264
No. Oh, you...

02:14.300 --> 02:17.269
You want me to go to the woods?
No. I don't do woods.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.737
The woods are dirty
and there are many, many bugs.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.100
What am I gonna say? I barely know him.

02:24.144 --> 02:28.103
You don't have to know him. You're
surgeons, been through the same war.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.584
Just remind him we've all been there,
we all came back.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.683
You're kind of a bully, you know that?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.488
I wouldn't do it
if it didn't work so well.

02:38.525 --> 02:42.791
This is one of the biggest surgeries
you may get near so pay attention.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.094
The patient is a 38-year-old male
hit by a drunk driver 12 years ago.

02:46.132 --> 02:49.693
- He suffered severe facial trauma.
- No nose, no lips.

02:49.769 --> 02:53.500
That's why we dubbed him Blowhole.
He's had nine reconstructive surgeries,

02:53.540 --> 02:56.134
none of which have brought back
full form or function.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.667
This surgery
has only been done four times.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.238
All candidates have to undergo
extensive psychological testing

03:02.315 --> 03:05.011
to determine whether
they can handle the process.

03:05.051 --> 03:09.317
Psychological components aside, this has
a chance of rejection or infection.

03:09.355 --> 03:13.121
He'll be on life-long anti-rejection
drugs which put him at risk

03:13.159 --> 03:17.459
for lymphoma, diabetes,
hypertension, renal failure.

03:17.497 --> 03:20.364
- I hear they call the dude Blowhole.
- What did you just say?

03:20.833 --> 03:23.165
Nothing. I just heard he had a nickname.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.070
Don't talk anymore. Ever.

03:34.247 --> 03:38.547
- Holy crap! Blowhole is right.
- What'd I tell you?

03:38.585 --> 03:44.182
<i>nasty, aggressive, unstoppable.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:48.258
<i>Just the kind of people you want</i>
<i>on your side when you're really screwed.</i>

03:49.963 --> 03:52.591
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Mr. David Young.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.328
Today he'll be receiving
a face transplant.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.633
Dr. Hunt and his team'll be
recovering the donor graft.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.941
We're replacing 70 percent
of Mr. Young's face.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.675
- You can see the deficit here.
- Or here.

04:10.617 --> 04:16.418
The donor recovery will include
his nose, left eye, lips, left zygoma.

04:16.456 --> 04:20.051
Why will allotransplantation work
better than traditional techniques?

04:20.093 --> 04:25.156
Aesthetic outcome allows re-enervation
of nerves, giving a better result.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.098
Very good, Dr. Grey.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.760
We'll position the flap
over Mr. Young's face.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.430
- How do we know we're clear?
- The graft turns pink.

04:32.472 --> 04:33.962
Excellent.

04:35.174 --> 04:40.043
- Dave, any questions for us?
- Has anyone seen the donor?

04:40.079 --> 04:43.446
Yes, he's a match with your age,
skin tone and blood type.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.153
- What does he look like?
- I think you'll be satisfied.

04:49.188 --> 04:51.850
Who am I kidding?
It's a face, right?

04:51.891 --> 04:55.588
If I end up anything above
a point and stare freak,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.220
I'm gonna call it a success.

04:59.866 --> 05:03.495
Karev, you're with me and the donor.
Usually we take them at the same time,

05:03.569 --> 05:05.730
but donor's life support is fading.
Move.

05:05.772 --> 05:09.139
- Thank you, sir.
- Stevens, Grey.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.904
- Yes.
- No, the other Grey.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.378
- Really? Great.
- Great.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.609
You did an awesome job in there.

05:16.649 --> 05:21.086
- Call me after the pre-op labs come in.
- Dr. Sloan, only one resident?

05:21.120 --> 05:23.850
Wait for Bailey.
There's enough of a crowd.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.655
- What the hell?
- Izzie, I don't think you have time

05:28.695 --> 05:30.856
- to scrub in.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.

05:31.297 --> 05:34.460
- Awesome job.
- She probably quizzed him in bed.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.560
- She gets to work on Blowhole...
- Shut your mouths!

05:41.808 --> 05:43.537
Finish the chart. I'll be back.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.849
O'Malley, Grey?
I need you on pre-ops and post-ops.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.681
There's the biggest surgery
in the world happening.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.520
Yes. Half our attendings are involved,
which is why we need strong residents

05:57.557 --> 06:00.185
on pre-ops and post-ops.
Yang, you're with me.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.159
- Moving to the big leagues.
- What?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.560
- She gets a solo?
- Today?

06:03.596 --> 06:06.394
Nice old lady with a hernia,
you're gonna fix it.

06:06.466 --> 06:09.833
Congratulations.
I know I should seem more enthusiastic,

06:09.869 --> 06:12.429
- but I'm not that big a person.
- Don't worry about it.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.472
Is it wrong to have hatred
in your heart?

06:18.177 --> 06:20.941
Good morning, Miss Sulley.
I'm Dr. Cristina Yang.

06:21.013 --> 06:24.005
- I'll perform your hernia repair.
- Lovely to meet you.

06:24.050 --> 06:28.316
- Have any questions before we start?
- Yes. Hand me my purse.

06:29.722 --> 06:33.886
My friends gave me a bunch of questions,
and I can't remember any of them.

06:33.926 --> 06:38.625
They're such worrywarts. They're all
off on a European tour without me.

06:38.664 --> 06:42.464
They threatened not to go when this
became a problem. I told 'em no.

06:42.502 --> 06:46.199
No. We have been saving up for this
for two years.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.969
I was able to get my deposit back
with a doctor's note.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.609
Cristina Yang. Yes?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.741
No. No, it has to be today.

06:59.819 --> 07:04.654
It's stage four. She has
to see Dr. Swender, not a partner.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.655
Um, I'm sorry, ma'am.

07:07.693 --> 07:10.560
I will get to your questions
when I come to examine you. OK?

07:10.596 --> 07:13.793
Referral is Golding? Golding.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.780
A little early in the day
for that, don't you think?

07:27.814 --> 07:31.079
- You sound like my mother.
- I met your mother. I liked her.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.147
- Who sent you, Richard?
- Uh, Bailey.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.916
Of course.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.486
I'm sorry about your patient.
I know how hard it can be.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.127
I had a patient a couple of years ago...

07:46.165 --> 07:48.360
Young guy, 50 maybe.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.529
Simple knee replacement.
He was post-op, he was fine.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.701
I told his wife she could get him lunch.
A simple knee replacement. Nothing.

07:55.741 --> 07:58.710
He'd been getting short of breath.
I put him on blood thinners

07:58.744 --> 08:00.803
for a post-surgical PE.

08:00.847 --> 08:05.614
And... it wasn't until he was vomiting
up dark blood, looking me in the eye,

08:05.651 --> 08:08.745
telling me that he was dying
that I figured it out.

08:08.788 --> 08:12.224
That I was wrong. It wasn't a PE.
He was bleeding internally.

08:12.258 --> 08:16.285
It wouldn't have been fatal,
but the blood thinners...

08:19.632 --> 08:22.692
God, I will never forget the look
on his wife's face

08:22.768 --> 08:25.293
when she came back
with that sandwich in her hand,

08:25.338 --> 08:28.637
asking me why her husband
wasn't in his room anymore.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.837
How do you live with it?

08:33.913 --> 08:35.881
Killing him.

08:36.782 --> 08:40.842
Taking him from his wife.
How do you live with it?

08:43.688 --> 08:48.786
- We call it malpractice...
- I know. I'm asking when you get up,

08:48.828 --> 08:52.025
how do you look at yourself
in the mirror?

08:52.064 --> 08:54.123
Look, I'm not... I'm...

08:56.702 --> 08:58.192
I'm asking.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.577
Can I get one of those?

09:07.914 --> 09:08.938
Yeah.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.850
It's the not knowing that does it.
Not knowing if he's OK,

09:15.888 --> 09:19.722
not knowing if he's coming back.
Maybe I've just been dumped.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.695
It's not knowing if I'm single
that makes me wanna throw up all day.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.857
- You are not listening to me, are you?
- Uh, sorry.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.733
No, no, that's OK. I get it.
You've got solo surgery and Gl Joe.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.603
It's a charmed life.
You don't have time for me.

09:33.673 --> 09:36.801
I have not had Gl Joe.
We've kissed a couple times.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.868
It's like friends with benefits...
without the benefits.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.279
- Still no sex.
- Mm-mmm. Not a charmed life.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.880
Lab results from the splenectomy.

09:50.623 --> 09:53.421
- Do we ask?
- No.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.959
'Cause he might tell us.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.064
Can you imagine?
This guy's got a family, right?

10:01.100 --> 10:06.902
Wife, kids? One day they'll see his face
on somebody else's body.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.874
- It's kind of creepy, right?
- Mr. Young won't look exactly

10:09.909 --> 10:13.845
like the donor. The underlying facial
structure of two people can be

10:13.879 --> 10:17.337
- very different.
- A person's identity is more than

10:17.383 --> 10:20.944
skin and bone.
His expression, style, eyes.

10:20.987 --> 10:25.219
The donor's family wouldn't recognize
this face on anyone else.

10:25.257 --> 10:28.488
- Transplant surgeons are antsy.
- They're always antsy.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.462
They can't relax until they
got live tissue in their coolers.

10:31.497 --> 10:37.163
I am making the final dissection.
Karev, hold right of the temple

10:37.236 --> 10:40.637
and gently lift. Don't tear the flesh.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.079
Awesome.

10:52.551 --> 10:57.079
Tenderness around the incision
is normal. No signs of infection.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.353
Could you redress that wound?

11:02.595 --> 11:06.793
Megan, will you please go to 20...

11:06.832 --> 11:10.290
Um, go to room 2214

11:10.336 --> 11:13.203
and just take out the drain.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.297
When you're ready.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.842
It's seems personal, we wouldn't
ask if we didn't need to know,

11:19.879 --> 11:21.369
but have you passed gas yet?

11:26.185 --> 11:27.516
Sorry.

11:29.922 --> 11:34.086
We can't release you
until that happens. The gas.

11:34.126 --> 11:37.926
I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen,
but are they supposed to look like that?

11:37.963 --> 11:41.160
- Like what?
- The bleeding and the shiner.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.498
And that one looks like she's suicidal.

11:43.536 --> 11:47.996
- They're supposed to be doctors?
- We're gonna reserve judgment on that.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.409
- Freak show.
- What the heck do we do with them?

11:52.478 --> 11:55.845
- Can we shove them in a locker?
- We should talk to them.

11:55.881 --> 12:00.045
No. We're professionals.
That's clearly personal.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.883
Besides, we'll waste time,
never see the solo surgery

12:02.922 --> 12:06.187
- or the face transplant.
- Oh, that's a good point.

12:06.225 --> 12:10.093
- I guess we should ignore it then.
- Yeah, just ignore it.

12:10.162 --> 12:13.359
- It's the professional thing to do.
- Professionally...

12:17.069 --> 12:20.038
It's important that you take
all the medications...

12:20.072 --> 12:24.566
Risk of rejection and infection.
I know. You drilled it into my head

12:24.643 --> 12:26.873
- a thousand times.
- Is your family here yet?

12:26.912 --> 12:30.211
I ask because someone needs
to take care of you afterwards.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.776
I don't have family, but my friends
are coming after the surgery.

12:33.853 --> 12:37.084
I'm excited to meet them
and show them my new face.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.615
We met in an online chat room
for orchid lovers.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.927
We've never actually "met" met, so...

12:45.030 --> 12:48.557
Dave, after the surgery,
this device helps prevent lung problems

12:48.601 --> 12:51.263
by exercising the muscles
you use to breathe.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.295
- I'd like you to practice on it now.
- Sit up straight.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.571
Take three easy breaths
and then blow into that.

12:58.410 --> 13:01.436
- Hole.
- That's it!

13:01.480 --> 13:05.280
Both of you, in the hall, now!
You really think that was OK?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.945
- That was doctorly?!
- Find something else to do.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.980
- What the hell's going on with you?
- They made inappropriate jokes

13:12.057 --> 13:14.958
at the expense of the patient.
Right in front of him.

13:15.027 --> 13:19.123
I have been trying to teach them,
and they were cruel and inappropriate.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.794
OK, they were inappropriate.
You know what else is inappropriate?

13:22.868 --> 13:24.768
This. You.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.467
This case is my baby.
I've spent three years planning for it,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.805
and you are not about to
piss all over it.

13:30.843 --> 13:34.506
- You're off the case.
- No. He needs me in there with him.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.676
- You can't leave him alone with them.
- You wanna be there for his feelings,

13:38.751 --> 13:41.242
you can be there before and after
the surgery,

13:41.287 --> 13:44.518
but you're not coming in my OR.
Whatever's going on with you,

13:44.557 --> 13:45.888
get it under control.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.662
- I found them.
- What?

13:52.698 --> 13:56.225
- Your questions about the surgery?
- One of my friends, Phil Ferguson,

13:56.268 --> 13:59.533
he's a retired surgeon.
He told me to ask you these.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.836
I can't seem to find my glasses.
My friends should be here.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.708
I put my glasses down somewhere,
they find them...

14:05.744 --> 14:10.238
Will you finally be able to pick up your
grandkids? A question from a doctor?

14:10.316 --> 14:15.151
No. No, my other friends helped me
with questions. I added a few on my own.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.519
Like, "Will it hurt?"

14:17.590 --> 14:19.717
Will it... hurt?

14:19.792 --> 14:23.990
- You'll be anesthetized.
- Yes, I know that.

14:24.029 --> 14:28.625
- I mean after. Will it hurt?
- You should expect normal post-op pain.

14:32.104 --> 14:37.508
Yes? Yes.
No, that is fantastic. I'll take it.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.570
Thank you so much.
I'll get in touch with her right away.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.171
2:30. Anytime is fine.

14:43.215 --> 14:47.675
So I've covered 22, 13, 19 and 33.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.384
Yeah, OK. I've got 2011 and 2007.

14:52.424 --> 14:55.689
Mer, there is something wrong
with Izzie.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.322
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

14:58.364 --> 15:02.892
- I know that there is something wrong.
- We're drowning in intern drama.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.402
We don't need resident drama too.

15:05.471 --> 15:08.963
If it's a problem, she'll tell us.
Until then, just ignore it.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.976
I repeat, ignore it.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.882
- What in God's name is going on?
- A personal issue.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.217
We are just trying
to give them their privacy.

15:22.254 --> 15:26.714
Gee, you think for a second I wanted
to get involved with your intern drama?

15:26.759 --> 15:30.160
- We were not this bad.
- Getting married in Vegas.

15:30.195 --> 15:34.097
Shacking up with attendings. Cutting
LVAD wires. You don't have to like it,

15:34.166 --> 15:37.363
- but you have to manage it.
- We've got it under control.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.964
Wait! I love you, Megan!

15:44.643 --> 15:47.806
Sir, are you OK?
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

15:53.052 --> 15:57.648
Whatever it is the two of you
have going on, it stops now.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.591
- I didn't mean to...
- Don't talk while she's talking.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.995
You are scaring the patients. You're
making this hospital look ridiculous.

16:05.064 --> 16:08.261
- You're making us look incompetent.
- Not a good idea.

16:08.300 --> 16:12.634
Just stay away from each other. So much
as a tear or a glance at each other,

16:12.671 --> 16:14.639
- and it's over. No!
- I don't understand.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.972
- Don't talk while I'm talking.
- That's what I was trying to tell...

16:19.111 --> 16:21.511
Now just get out! Go!

16:22.881 --> 16:24.576
Not together.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.444
That felt good.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.387
- You paged me, Dr. Bailey?
- Oh! Yes.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.856
Um, finished your part
of the face transplant?

16:32.925 --> 16:36.088
I cleared my schedule to watch
Sloan and Yang do surgery.

16:36.128 --> 16:39.097
Whatever it is you need,
I hope it's not too time-consuming.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.861
That all depends on
how fast you can drive and talk.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.836
- I'm sorry?
- I need you to drive out to the woods

16:45.904 --> 16:48.270
and talk Derek Shepherd
into coming back here.

16:48.307 --> 16:52.869
And I believe you also might run
into Callie Torres. With a flat tire.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.540
Or a broken heel.
Or an axe-wielding serial killer.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.682
- You're serious?
- I sent Torres after Shepherd,

17:00.719 --> 17:04.018
and she's fallen off the grid.
Her phone goes to voicemail.

17:04.089 --> 17:08.048
I'm normally not a panicky person,
but I'm a fan of daytime television.

17:08.093 --> 17:11.290
My crazy scenarios... Never mind.

17:11.329 --> 17:16.267
I need you to go get Torres
and Shepherd and bring them back here

17:16.300 --> 17:20.670
- before the chief notices you're gone.
- Shepherd's been gone all week...

17:20.739 --> 17:25.869
Hunt! You survived a war,
you can do this.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.880
I know I can do this.
I'm saying I don't want to.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.015
People don't really say "no" to you,
do they?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.288
Not when I say please.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.152
I'm saying please!

17:45.497 --> 17:47.931
OR is set, transport's on its way.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.402
- You ready?
- I've been ready for 12 years.

17:51.470 --> 17:55.065
You said you had friends coming
to take care of you?

17:55.140 --> 17:58.303
- Yeah, after my surgery.
- They're coming now.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.036
Surprise!

18:02.314 --> 18:04.544
Hi. It's me, Sheena.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.143
You can probably tell
from my Vanda roeblingiana.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.421
I hope you're not mad
that we came early.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.824
We thought we should be here
through it all. Make sure you knew...

18:14.860 --> 18:19.126
Get out. Get them out. They're
strangers. I don't want them in here.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.962
We're hardly strangers, Dave.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.525
We chat every night,
all night, for years.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.602
- We flew in...
- Get out! We've never met.

18:27.673 --> 18:31.074
You don't know me,
anything about me. Get out!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.578
Get them out! Get out. Get out!

18:33.612 --> 18:35.239
Get out!

18:45.858 --> 18:48.554
Hey. Did you get my page?
I got the appointment.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.927
It's in, like, 15 minutes.
How amazing am I?

18:51.997 --> 18:54.465
Usually takes weeks to get in.
You look at the research?

18:54.500 --> 18:58.095
- Seriously, can I just eat?
- No.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.105
- I'm sorry. You don't have time.
- Time for what?

19:01.140 --> 19:04.769
There's a... an enema.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.608
- Uh, Izzie's enema.
- Yes.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.979
I was supposed to get an enema today,
but I decided it can wait.

19:11.049 --> 19:14.143
- Talk about something else?
- We need to talk about it.

19:14.219 --> 19:18.349
You've been complaining
about being really backed up.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.119
- I got you an appointment.
- If you need an enema,

19:21.160 --> 19:24.027
- you shouldn't have fries.
- You booked her for an enema?

19:24.863 --> 19:27.991
You can't just say that you're
all backed up and just sit there.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.193
If you make the decision
to get an enema,

19:30.235 --> 19:34.171
- you should get an enema.
- Maybe you're the one that's backed up.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.867
Solo surgery panic? Tell you what.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.809
I'll scrub in.
If you can't handle it, I'll take over.

19:39.878 --> 19:43.211
I don't... OK. You know...

19:43.282 --> 19:47.013
I'm just saying...
enemas can be a serious business.

19:47.085 --> 19:49.952
OK. Izzie, enema is code for what?

19:51.924 --> 19:55.018
- My enema, my business.
- Uh, fifteen minutes!

19:56.361 --> 19:59.125
This is a really strange day.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.730
I was a second-year resident.
MVC rolls in.

20:02.801 --> 20:06.862
Parents in the front seat. Three kids in
the back. Kids were OK. Mom and dad

20:06.939 --> 20:11.000
a little banged up. Nothing terrible,
talking and laughing in the ER.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.843
Turns out both parents
had massive internal injuries.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.213
I operated
on them both that night. Hours.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.750
Lost them both.

20:21.320 --> 20:26.986
If I'd moved faster, rushed them to CT,
known how bad off they were sooner,

20:27.025 --> 20:30.859
but... I didn't.
The oldest kid was nine.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.364
When I came out to tell them
about their dad,

20:34.333 --> 20:37.496
he was consoling the three-
and five-year-old about their mother.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.731
I'll never get that image out
of my head. This nine-year-old boy

20:41.773 --> 20:46.267
trying to hold these two little ones,
his arms just not big enough.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.306
I don't know
how I came back the next day.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.886
I think part of me never did.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.684
I'm surprised
you didn't talk about Iraq.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.489
I don't talk about Iraq.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.792
What my point was, I kept...

21:05.864 --> 21:08.594
You know, I... I went back.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.464
I showed up. I...

21:11.637 --> 21:13.264
I showed up for work, you know?

21:14.606 --> 21:17.439
You go dead inside...

21:17.509 --> 21:19.773
You go dead inside
because if you felt it,

21:19.845 --> 21:24.145
if you let yourself feel that,
no way you're going back.

21:24.182 --> 21:25.206
No way.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.461
- You blew it off?
- Cristina, please.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.272
I called every favor I had
in this hospital and then some.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.370
Swender's the best surgical oncologist.
Why didn't you go?

21:55.414 --> 21:58.611
- Why do you care so much?
- Why don't you?

21:58.650 --> 22:01.448
I'm working really hard on this.
The least you could do...

22:01.486 --> 22:05.946
They were calling the guy Blowhole.
Not just the interns, Alex.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.619
What are they gonna call me
when I'm the patient?

22:08.660 --> 22:12.118
- Swiss Cheese for Brains?
- No, that's awkward and long.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.190
- Blowhole's pithy.
- I'm not gonna be a piece of meat

22:15.267 --> 22:17.633
while you all fight over
who gets to slice me up

22:17.669 --> 22:21.469
- and then laugh while you do it.
- OK, this right here,

22:21.540 --> 22:25.533
this, um, is an emotional
thing you're having,

22:25.610 --> 22:28.170
which is why you should tell Meredith,
or George...

22:28.246 --> 22:30.714
I'm not telling anybody,
so just drop it!

22:31.516 --> 22:35.475
No! You're not dumping this on me.
You're not dying in my arms.

22:35.520 --> 22:41.516
- So either you tell them or I will.
- I don't even know if I want treatment.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.655
I know too much.
I know how violent surgery can be.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.700
They're gonna cut into my brain,
slice open my abdomen

22:48.767 --> 22:51.133
and pull my organs out. And for what?

22:51.169 --> 22:55.435
Surgery fails all the time. Derek
Shepherd is in the freaking woods

22:55.474 --> 22:57.999
because we fail all the time!

22:58.076 --> 23:01.443
Even if they do everything, I have
a five percent chance of survival.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.505
Five percent.

23:03.815 --> 23:08.309
Why would I put myself through hell,
run poison through my veins,

23:08.353 --> 23:11.652
irradiate my brain
if it's not gonna work anyway?

23:15.694 --> 23:17.093
Why did you tell me then?

23:18.964 --> 23:22.695
If you don't want my help and you're
not gonna do anything about it,

23:22.734 --> 23:24.429
why did you tell me?

23:27.139 --> 23:29.471
Keep your mouth shut.
Forget I told you anything.

23:29.508 --> 23:30.668
Izzie!

23:38.817 --> 23:41.752
You need to call them back, Dave.

23:41.820 --> 23:45.779
You're my surgeon, right?
You're not my shrink.

23:45.857 --> 23:50.123
- So why don't you just do your job?
- I can't do my job anymore.

23:50.162 --> 23:53.825
It took us three years to find the
right candidate, and part of you being

23:53.865 --> 23:56.834
the right candidate is having
a support system post-op.

23:56.868 --> 24:00.395
You cannot do this alone.
The ethics board will not allow me

24:00.439 --> 24:04.967
to let you do it alone.
You need your friends.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.945
You see that orchid?

24:08.013 --> 24:12.848
It's ugly. To anyone who doesn't
know orchids, it's dark and droopy

24:12.884 --> 24:16.183
and it's ugly, unless you know it.

24:16.221 --> 24:21.181
Unless you understand how it adapted,
what it's lived through,

24:21.226 --> 24:24.195
and how strong it had to be to survive.

24:24.229 --> 24:28.256
A photo of that orchid, that's the
only picture my friends had seen of me.

24:28.333 --> 24:32.292
That's how I wanted them to picture me
until I had my new face.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.139
People look away from me.

24:39.110 --> 24:43.046
Kids cry and adults cringe.

24:43.081 --> 24:45.447
They look away.

24:48.053 --> 24:50.886
I didn't want my friends...

24:50.922 --> 24:55.291
I didn't want them to ever have
any reason to look away.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.719
They didn't look away.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.661
Your friends, they didn't cringe.
Not one of them.

25:02.734 --> 25:05.601
They didn't look away.
You looked away, didn't trust them.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.662
You looked away from them.

25:08.373 --> 25:11.308
Let us call them.
They flew all the way here.

25:11.376 --> 25:15.005
Just let us call them back.
It's not too late.

25:15.046 --> 25:20.348
If you want this surgery, Dave,
you gotta give them a chance.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.451
Uh, Chief?

25:27.692 --> 25:30.320
- Dr. Bailey?
- How's your mood?

25:31.863 --> 25:36.232
Eager. Anxious. I'm excited
about Sloan's face transplant.

25:36.268 --> 25:39.829
I'm a little concerned about Derek,
but all in all...

25:39.871 --> 25:42.396
- Do I look like a therapist?
- You asked.

25:44.776 --> 25:49.611
I've lost Hunt and Torres.
I sent them to get Shepherd,

25:49.648 --> 25:51.548
and I never heard from them again.

25:51.616 --> 25:55.108
I was trying to solve
the Shepherd situation for you, sir.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.849
But it appears I've somehow
made it three times worse.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.791
So I'm telling you,
and my next move, I believe,

26:01.826 --> 26:03.555
is that I'm gonna call the police.

26:03.595 --> 26:07.326
Because I'm half convinced
they're all dead.

26:07.365 --> 26:11.563
On a spit with a one-armed man
turning them into shish kebabs, sir.

26:12.037 --> 26:13.937
It's my mind, it just goes there.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.504
- Don't beat yourself up.
- It's a hard decision.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.908
Yeah, you've been with Pierce
for the whole year.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.537
Just listen to your heart...

26:21.580 --> 26:24.777
- Why are they starting late?
- A problem with the recipient.

26:24.816 --> 26:27.808
They've only got a few hours left
for that face to be viable.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.720
Sloan must be freaking out, right?

26:35.226 --> 26:38.161
- Home wrecker.
- What did you say? What did you say?

26:38.196 --> 26:41.632
- Guys!
- You two, get out. You, come with me.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.760
- Come on.
- Hey, buddy.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.670
You need to start talking.
You need to start talking now.

26:47.706 --> 26:51.506
- I really can't. Talk to Steve.
- You gotta start talking, dude,

26:51.543 --> 26:55.775
because any second, they're gonna start
that face transplant surgery.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.406
- Her friend...
- Best friend.

26:57.449 --> 27:01.749
...is gonna have her very first
solo surgery, and so...

27:01.820 --> 27:04.846
- ...we have little patience right now.
- It's not my place...

27:04.889 --> 27:10.486
OK! You are gonna tell me
everything that's going on.

27:10.996 --> 27:14.090
Or else every time I have a rectal exam
or an infected abscess,

27:14.165 --> 27:16.497
it's gonna have your name on it.
Every time!

27:23.441 --> 27:26.205
Megan was with Pierce.
But they broke up.

27:26.244 --> 27:29.645
While they were broken up,
she slept with Steve.

27:29.714 --> 27:33.514
Then she got back together with Pierce.
But Steve sent her an e-mail

27:33.585 --> 27:36.645
about how they slept together.
Instead of e-mailing her,

27:36.721 --> 27:39.155
he hit "reply all,"
went to a bunch of people.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.886
One of them was Pierce.
Now Steve says he loves her.

27:41.926 --> 27:45.089
Pierce wants to kill him.
Megan's really freaking out

27:45.130 --> 27:48.463
because... OK, wait. So a while back,

27:48.533 --> 27:52.594
someone sent this text message.
I didn't get it, didn't get to see it.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.730
It just came to certain people's phones.

27:58.977 --> 28:02.572
Why would they come back?
I was cruel. I was hateful.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.811
You were scared. They surprised you.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.445
You were in shock. It wasn't
what you were expecting. You were...

28:09.487 --> 28:11.352
- You were just...
- I was awful.

28:12.524 --> 28:18.292
You were scared.
And you were trying to protect them.

28:18.329 --> 28:21.162
If they're your friends,
they'll understand.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.479
I didn't want you
to see it. This.

28:39.517 --> 28:43.317
This ugliness, it... it isn't me.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.686
I... I didn't want you to see it.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.420
This, right here,

28:53.498 --> 28:56.524
looks just like the Coryanthes speciosa.

28:56.568 --> 29:01.028
- You guys see that?
- She's right.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.768
The coloring's just the same.

29:06.611 --> 29:11.878
If the surgery doesn't take, if I
reject the donor face, I'll be uglier.

29:11.916 --> 29:15.181
I'll... I'll be even uglier
than I am right now.

29:15.220 --> 29:19.350
Please don't call my dear friend ugly.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.449
You're a survivor.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.087
And it's written all over your face.

29:47.852 --> 29:50.252
What the hell is this? This is not OK.

29:50.288 --> 29:55.316
I have a hospital to run.
And Derek! What's the matter with you?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.328
- We've all been there.
- We said that.

29:57.362 --> 30:00.763
- We've all had tough losses.
- He knows that.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.568
We show up the next day
and we try and save the next life.

30:04.602 --> 30:09.005
- Yeah, we covered that too.
- OK, what about this?

30:09.741 --> 30:11.902
Nothing we do can stop death.

30:11.943 --> 30:14.810
We can hold it at bay now and then.
But everyone dies.

30:15.547 --> 30:16.639
And that's not on us.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.689
I took a pregnant woman in
for a simple surgery, and I botched it.

30:26.724 --> 30:30.490
That is on me.
I should feel badly about that.

30:30.528 --> 30:34.294
And you? You should feel badly
that while I was out here,

30:34.332 --> 30:38.826
you sent Meredith out here expecting
a ring. Why would you do that?

30:38.870 --> 30:41.805
Why in God's name would you do that?

30:45.743 --> 30:47.108
I was trying to help.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.608
She didn't wanna come.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.048
She wanted to leave you
out here alone...

30:54.052 --> 30:57.021
- I was trying to help.
- Trying to help yourself, not me.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.216
Yourself.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.588
I hit the ring in the woods.

31:02.627 --> 31:03.958
In the woods.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.521
You destroyed me.

31:16.841 --> 31:20.470
This is the final dissection.
We'll place the facial graft.

31:20.511 --> 31:23.344
I'll connect vessels and nerves.
Get the microscope ready.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.349
Yes, right away.

31:27.652 --> 31:30.314
OK, people. It's time.

31:31.456 --> 31:34.448
- Ever put a new face on someone?
- Really?

31:34.492 --> 31:37.222
I'll take the right side.
You take the left.

31:38.263 --> 31:39.992
Very gently.

31:41.065 --> 31:44.694
That's it. Take your time.
He's not going anywhere.

31:46.271 --> 31:47.431
Thank you.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.901
Watch the left corner of his mouth.
You're off center just a bit.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.946
There we go.
Careful around the eyes.

31:59.183 --> 32:01.811
Good. Very good, Dr. Grey.

32:16.801 --> 32:17.995
- Get out.
- No.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.060
- Get out!
- No!

32:19.137 --> 32:21.765
- Richard, get out!
- No!

32:22.874 --> 32:26.139
I've destroyed lives before.
Several, in fact.

32:26.177 --> 32:29.510
Yours is not one of them. I sent the
woman you love out here to help you.

32:29.547 --> 32:33.347
I sent the woman who loves you
out here to bring you back to your life.

32:33.384 --> 32:37.286
If you ruin it with her, that's on you.
I don't accept it.

32:38.222 --> 32:40.884
You're scared, drunk,
don't know which way is up.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.793
You threw a punch at your best friend,
a ring at Meredith, wanna throw me out.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.729
I'm not accepting it!

32:47.398 --> 32:51.664
Because I'm older than you,
and I've been where you are.

32:52.003 --> 32:54.665
You been drunk for a few days.
I was drunk for years.

32:57.942 --> 33:00.274
And I know
you're gonna need at least one friend

33:00.311 --> 33:02.802
when you come out of that hole
you're digging.

33:06.851 --> 33:08.842
I hope you come out of it soon.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.418
I'll be here when you do.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.459
I don't think I can get her back.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.633
Did you call her?

33:28.473 --> 33:30.839
What am I gonna say?

33:34.946 --> 33:37.176
I had an affair for years.

33:39.217 --> 33:42.050
When Adele found out, somehow she...

33:46.391 --> 33:48.757
She took me back.

33:52.063 --> 33:54.293
You can make your way back...

33:55.566 --> 33:57.193
...from anything.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.900
This is year one of your residency.

34:02.940 --> 34:06.103
You turn on each other now,
you're not gonna make it.

34:11.081 --> 34:13.777
OK. Here's what's gonna happen.

34:13.818 --> 34:17.185
All of you are going to go find
the sense the good Lord gave you

34:17.255 --> 34:21.157
and never behave like this
within the four walls of this hospital

34:21.225 --> 34:24.023
ever again. You are doctors.

34:24.062 --> 34:28.192
Pierce, get an ice pack and put it on
that oozing, disgusting mess of an eye.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.702
And, Steve, go to the pit
and get that unsanitary,

34:31.768 --> 34:34.567
bloody hand X-rayed and stitched.

34:34.639 --> 34:39.667
And, Megan, you should go to OB
because yes, you are pregnant.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.879
That was very Bailey.

34:47.452 --> 34:51.445
- You ready, Dr. Yang?
- Wait! I'm sorry.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.980
I need one thing from you
before I go under.

34:54.025 --> 34:57.119
I haven't asked for much.
You haven't answered my questions.

34:57.161 --> 34:59.755
I understand you're busy,
but I'm scared.

34:59.831 --> 35:03.494
I don't wanna die. I want to go
on a tour of Russia with my friends.

35:03.534 --> 35:08.335
I may just be a batty old lady to you,
and this may be a silly procedure,

35:08.372 --> 35:11.967
but I need you to tell me
that it's gonna be OK.

35:12.009 --> 35:14.204
You're my surgeon, after all.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.348
This isn't a silly procedure to me,
Miss Sulley.

35:19.383 --> 35:23.012
- And I will get you through this.
- OK.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.248
Thank you.

35:25.823 --> 35:27.017
I'm ready now.

35:46.744 --> 35:49.212
Izzie has stage four metastatic melanoma

35:49.247 --> 35:51.772
that has spread to her brain,
liver and skin.

35:51.816 --> 35:56.116
She may only have months to live
and she's resisting treatment.

35:56.187 --> 35:58.052
She needs help.

36:02.426 --> 36:03.859
Scalpel.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.804
Don't try to talk. It'll only hurt.

36:20.878 --> 36:23.904
- You did great.
- Can he see his new face?

36:23.948 --> 36:27.213
- I think he'd really like to see it.
- It's still early.

36:27.285 --> 36:31.483
It's very swollen and bruised.
The tissue needs time to settle.

36:31.556 --> 36:35.686
But yeah. I'll give you a sneak peak.

37:28.379 --> 37:30.847
Sometimes we fail,
but that's not always the case.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.371
I know.

37:32.917 --> 37:37.411
Blowhole has a new face. And what people
call him to get through the day has...

37:37.455 --> 37:38.752
I know.

37:41.525 --> 37:44.790
I told Alex. And Bailey.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.821
And they're telling Meredith and George.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.461
- Cristina...
- I couldn't do my job.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.129
I think you came to me for help,
and that's what I did.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.968
Because sometimes we win, Izzie.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.231
And I want you to fight.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.244
OK? For whatever that's worth,
I want you to fight.

38:10.688 --> 38:11.950
Thank you.

38:51.262 --> 38:52.524
Dr. Grey.

38:53.898 --> 38:57.026
They think you're taking advantage
of me, that I'm using you.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.434
But they don't know us.

38:59.470 --> 39:02.462
They think that we're ugly,
but I know that we're beautiful.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.799
And we can adapt
to a hostile environment.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.326
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for calling.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.123
I love you.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.698
I know.

39:35.072 --> 39:37.632
Would you still love me
if I wasn't a surgeon?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.403
No.

39:49.286 --> 39:52.881
No, because Izzie...

39:54.158 --> 39:56.854
...has skin cancer
that's spread to her brain.

39:59.330 --> 40:02.322
You're one of about 20 people
in the world who can save her.

40:03.801 --> 40:08.568
I don't know if I respect somebody who
could walk away from a gift like that.

40:11.275 --> 40:12.902
So please don't.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.772
Here are her scans.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.080
It's pretty bad.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.195
<i>Practicing medicine</i>

40:38.235 --> 40:40.999
<i>doesn't lend itself well to</i>
<i>the making of friends.</i>

40:45.342 --> 40:47.970
<i>Maybe because life and mortality...</i>

40:51.482 --> 40:53.746
<i>...are in our faces all the time.</i>

40:56.387 --> 40:59.049
<i>Maybe because in</i>
<i>staring down death every day...</i>

41:00.691 --> 41:03.023
<i>...we're forced to know that life...</i>

41:04.061 --> 41:05.756
<i>...every minute...</i>

41:07.097 --> 41:08.359
<i>...is borrowed time.</i>

41:15.940 --> 41:18.875
<i>And each person</i>
<i>we let ourselves care about...</i>

41:25.049 --> 41:27.984
<i>...is just one more loss,</i>
<i>somewhere down the line.</i>

41:35.559 --> 41:38.050
<i>For this reason,</i>

41:38.095 --> 41:42.156
<i>I know some doctors who just</i>
<i>don't bother making friends at all.</i>

41:50.574 --> 41:52.132
<i>But the rest of us...</i>

41:53.978 --> 41:56.469
<i>...we make it ourjob to move that line.</i>

41:59.884 --> 42:02.079
<i>To push each loss...</i>

42:05.022 --> 42:07.547
<i>...as far away as we can.</i>
