[Becky] Now, is there anything
I've forgotten to do?

01:05.959 --> 01:07.375
Let's see...

01:07.458 --> 01:08.834
Books balanced,

01:08.917 --> 01:11.625
accounts accounted for...

01:11.709 --> 01:13.083
Petty cash...

01:13.166 --> 01:16.083
Ahh, petty.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.208
Hey, I've been looking for those.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.750
Want a doughnut?

01:20.834 --> 01:23.125
This is a safe.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.250
I intend to fill it with money.

01:25.333 --> 01:28.417
I'm going to
the Better Business Boot Camp.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.375
Business seminars are nothing but hooey.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.458
I could teach moneymaking just like that.

01:34.542 --> 01:36.959
You need common sense.

01:37.041 --> 01:40.083
I've got the most uncommonly common sense.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.333
Well, I could use more dollars
and less sense.

01:44.417 --> 01:47.875
Don't worry.
We'll take care of everything.

01:47.959 --> 01:51.291
Maybe I should take
a correspondence course.

01:51.375 --> 01:52.917
Nah. Go.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.875
Don't you trust me to run things?

01:55.959 --> 01:59.542
Yes, if you just follow
one simple instruction.

01:59.625 --> 02:00.792
What's that?

02:00.875 --> 02:02.500
Don't do anything!

02:02.583 --> 02:04.875
That's what I do when she's here.

02:07.917 --> 02:10.208
I know-- pet coconuts.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.041
Nah, they'd never sell.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.041
Wait. A watch chicken.

02:14.125 --> 02:15.792
It'll guard your house

02:15.875 --> 02:18.333
and give you breakfast, too.

02:18.458 --> 02:20.000
Here you go.

02:20.083 --> 02:24.166
Lemon sludge and a pomegranate fizz.
Heavy on the fizz.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.333
Put them on my tab as usual.

02:26.417 --> 02:28.875
Say, you're a businessman.

02:28.959 --> 02:32.041
What's the secret of making money?

02:32.125 --> 02:34.083
I wish I knew.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.333
Business has been terrible lately.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.250
Not you, too.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.792
You need a partner
with a nose for business.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.458
Yeah? Like who?

02:43.542 --> 02:45.375
Like me, heh heh.

02:45.458 --> 02:49.291
With my know-how, and your,
whatever, we'd make a fortune.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.792
What about me?

02:50.875 --> 02:53.166
Sure. The more the merrier.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.583
What business could we be partners in?

02:56.667 --> 02:57.834
I don't know.

02:57.917 --> 03:00.667
It's hard to think when you're hungry.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.458
How about some food?

03:02.542 --> 03:05.458
Right. I got just the thing.

03:05.542 --> 03:08.834
How about flying mail to people overnight,

03:08.917 --> 03:11.709
delivering letters the next day?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.834
Nah. It'd never catch on.

03:13.917 --> 03:17.000
[Baloo] Who'd pay money
to get bills faster?

03:17.083 --> 03:20.375
We got to get people
something they can't resist.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.834
[sniffing]

03:23.917 --> 03:26.333
One Louie's special.

03:26.417 --> 03:30.667
[Kit] Oh, boy. You make the best
pizza anywhere, Louie.

03:30.750 --> 03:35.750
Too bad you have to fly
way out here to get it.

03:35.834 --> 03:39.083
Hey, partners.
That's it!

03:39.166 --> 03:41.792
[telephone rings]

03:41.875 --> 03:45.125
Pizza pie in the sky. Order, please.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.792
Pizza delivered by air anywhere.

03:47.875 --> 03:51.125
Guaranteed hot or your money back.

03:53.291 --> 03:57.125
Louie, this idea can't help making money.

03:57.208 --> 04:00.959
[Louie] Yeah--if somebody doesn't
eat all the profits.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.458
You'd eat all my dough...

04:03.542 --> 04:04.709
And toppings, too.

04:04.792 --> 04:06.458
In the pizza business,

04:06.542 --> 04:08.959
you can't have too many toppings...

04:09.041 --> 04:10.667
Except for anchovies.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.375
Nobody likes anchovies.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.792
Good thing, too.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.416
When I tried eating them--

04:16.500 --> 04:19.000
I hate to miss a good story,

04:19.083 --> 04:21.458
but we got deliveries.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.417
Keep the pizzas flying.

04:23.542 --> 04:25.041
Don't worry, Louie.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.166
We'll be back soon with the dough--

04:28.250 --> 04:29.834
The spending kind.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.750
I bet nobody's delivered pizza

04:44.834 --> 04:46.542
to an ice floe before.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.709
That's 'cause nobody had
the sense to advertise

04:50.792 --> 04:53.000
in <i>Better igloos and ice gardens.</i>

04:54.583 --> 04:58.750
Hey, somebody named Nanook
order a pizza?

04:58.834 --> 05:01.333
Whoa. How's the weather up there?

05:01.417 --> 05:02.750
Cold.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.208
You call this large pizza?

05:07.291 --> 05:10.875
It says here you ordered a small pizza.

05:10.959 --> 05:14.166
I ordered large pizza!

05:14.250 --> 05:15.834
The customer's always right,

05:15.917 --> 05:18.208
Especially large customers.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.583
Pizza pie in the sky.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.750
For cold cash, you get hot pizza.

05:29.834 --> 05:32.959
Isn't this guaranteed
delivery in two hours?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.834
It already midnight.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.875
Midnight?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.250
Are you crazy?

05:37.333 --> 05:39.041
The sun's still up.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.208
This land of midnight sun.

05:41.291 --> 05:42.750
And it's cold!

05:42.834 --> 05:44.542
It's not cold.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.542
It's just room temperature.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.083
Grr-r-r...

05:48.166 --> 05:49.834
I'll be right back.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.667
And don't forget the anchovies.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.667
Aah!

06:00.250 --> 06:02.834
[Kit] What was wrong this time?

06:02.917 --> 06:05.917
Nothing a blowtorch wouldn't cure.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.166
We have to deliver another pizza?

06:08.250 --> 06:10.667
No way around it, kiddo.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.667
The customer is always right.

06:18.959 --> 06:21.417
Here you go, one large pizza.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.417
Guaranteed fresh and hot.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.542
Hey. There's no anchovies.

06:25.625 --> 06:28.709
Louie must have forgot them.

06:28.792 --> 06:30.083
Well, no problem.

06:31.917 --> 06:34.166
Nothing fresher than that.

06:34.250 --> 06:38.458
I thought only Rebecca liked anchovies.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.291
I guess that makes two.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.291
Maybe three?

06:46.458 --> 06:49.917
You're not blaming me for this, right?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.125
Aah!

06:52.959 --> 06:55.792
[Kit] What happened this time?

06:55.875 --> 06:58.333
Brrr. You wouldn't believe it.

06:58.417 --> 07:02.000
If you see a killer whale
with pizza breath,

07:02.083 --> 07:04.166
tell him he owes us $5.00.

07:05.417 --> 07:08.000
You've used 400 gallons of gas

07:08.083 --> 07:10.583
trying to deliver one pizza.

07:10.667 --> 07:11.750
Brrr.

07:11.834 --> 07:14.333
We started out too small.

07:14.417 --> 07:17.792
If we're going to show Becky
we can succeed,

07:17.875 --> 07:19.959
we got to think big.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.083
The secret to every successful business--

07:26.166 --> 07:28.166
Advertising.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.917
[dings]

07:52.000 --> 07:55.041
Is this mass marketing or mess marketing?

07:55.125 --> 07:56.417
You just wait.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.291
With this promotion,

07:58.375 --> 08:00.667
the orders should start rolling in.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.333
<i>Louie calling </i> Sea Duck <i>. Come in, Baloo.</i>

08:03.417 --> 08:07.000
See? That's probably an order right now.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.500
[Baloo] Come in, Louie.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.000
[Louie] <i>Great news, Baloo.</i>

08:10.083 --> 08:13.917
We just got a big order-- 200 pizzas.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.417
One with anchovies.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.667
About those anchovies--

08:17.750 --> 08:19.625
200 pizzas?

08:19.709 --> 08:22.291
We're in business now, kiddo.

08:22.375 --> 08:26.250
[Baloo] We'd better stop
and get some anchovies.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.375
[Kit] How? We spent everything for gas.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.959
[Baloo] Not having money's no problem...

08:32.041 --> 08:34.667
If you know somebody who does.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.792
Isn't this like stealing?

08:36.875 --> 08:38.582
Bite your tongue.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.166
I'm not taking money.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.500
I'm just borrowing...

08:41.582 --> 08:43.457
without telling Rebecca.

08:43.542 --> 08:45.083
A great gal, Becky,

08:45.166 --> 08:46.875
but no business sense.

08:47.542 --> 08:50.792
This is just a small business loan.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.041
A very small loan.

08:53.125 --> 08:56.834
[Kit] We better try Bob's Discount
House of Anchovies.

08:56.917 --> 09:00.208
Hope he's having another
scratch and dent sale.

09:06.500 --> 09:10.250

Mmm, yum-yum.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.041
I stomp it!

10:46.125 --> 10:47.542
Better stomp fast.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.834

about that one who wants anchovies--

10:55.250 --> 10:56.333
[Baloo] Relax.

10:56.417 --> 10:57.750
I got it covered.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.458
Some are irregular,

10:59.542 --> 11:02.333
but they only cost $1.00.

11:02.417 --> 11:03.917
What are you saying?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.083
Anchovies!

11:06.166 --> 11:08.959
[Baloo] Can I smell a bargain, or what?

11:09.041 --> 11:11.750
Oh, ya-ya, oh, waa...

11:11.834 --> 11:15.125
Must have lowered his overhead too fast.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.667
I think he's sick.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.291
He does look somewhat green.

11:19.375 --> 11:21.542
Maybe he's allergic to something.

11:21.625 --> 11:25.709
A-anchov-anchovies.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.542
If Louie's sick,

11:27.625 --> 11:31.083
who's going to make all those pizzas?

11:31.166 --> 11:34.375
Yeah. How am I going to pay back Rebecca?

11:39.417 --> 11:41.667
[Baloo] The dough is mixed now.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.083
How's our time?

11:43.166 --> 11:47.375
OK, if we make 200 pizzas in 1 hour.

11:47.458 --> 11:48.458
No problem.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.875
All you got to do is think big.

11:54.834 --> 11:58.166
That's making pizza in no time flat.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.041
How was that?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.375
Off target 10 degrees.

12:07.458 --> 12:10.166
[Baloo] Never could hit with tomato sauce.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.750
I'll try to do better with the toppings.
Switching to autopilot.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.583
Hey, hey.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.166
OK, kiddo,

12:21.250 --> 12:23.083
it's all yours.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.583
[Baloo] Now we're cooking.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.166
Afraid not.
But there's not enough time

12:35.250 --> 12:37.417
to cook the pizzas <i>and </i> deliver them.

12:37.500 --> 12:41.333
Too bad we can't do both at the same time.

12:41.417 --> 12:45.667
Great! Why didn't I think of that?

12:45.750 --> 12:47.667
Oh, man.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.333
Anchovies.

12:49.417 --> 12:53.625
Anchovies! I hate anchovies.

12:53.709 --> 12:56.291
I wish Louie could go with us.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.709
Yeah. He could help carry this oven.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.542
[Baloo] [grunts] Now this pizza business

13:02.625 --> 13:04.542
is really going to take off.

13:10.458 --> 13:11.709
That's it.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.583
That is enough!

13:13.667 --> 13:18.083
I am phoning for reinforcements.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.375
Anchovies.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.500
Oh, they're everywhere!

13:20.583 --> 13:24.500
There's millions of them!

13:24.625 --> 13:26.750
Slimy fins and those--

13:26.834 --> 13:28.625
Those beady little eyes.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.291
Yecchh!

13:30.375 --> 13:33.125
I can almost smell them

13:33.208 --> 13:34.792
right in front of me.

13:34.875 --> 13:38.250
You'll never take me alive, fish face.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.375
Take that and some of this.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.458
I just want to use the phone.

13:45.542 --> 13:48.375
Don't jive me, you overgrown guppy.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.750
You idiot.

13:50.834 --> 13:55.417
I'm no anchovy. <i>This </i> is an anchovy!

13:55.500 --> 13:56.750
Yes.

13:56.834 --> 14:00.375
When this is over,
I'm getting an easier job.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.667
There's something exciting

14:06.750 --> 14:09.291
about getting a business off the ground.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.458
Yeah. Exciting.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.166
[crackling]

14:23.166 --> 14:26.000
Soon we'll be rolling in dough.

14:26.083 --> 14:29.375
Becky will see who knows about business.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.834
Where are we supposed to deliver

14:31.917 --> 14:34.000
these pizzas anyway?

14:34.083 --> 14:37.917
It's that new hotel, the Takeover Hostel.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.417
The Takeover Hostel?

14:39.500 --> 14:42.458
Isn't that where Rebecca's seminar is?

14:42.542 --> 14:45.125
I should have known

14:45.208 --> 14:47.375
things were going too good.

14:47.458 --> 14:51.083
Oh, I wonder what's going to happen next.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.583
[coughing]

14:53.667 --> 14:55.625
[Kit] There's a grease fire!

14:55.709 --> 14:57.625
The pizza!

14:57.709 --> 15:01.834
I can't see a thing, Little Britches.
Where are we heading?

15:02.417 --> 15:04.250
[Kit] Look out!

15:04.333 --> 15:06.083
[Baloo] We've got to put it out!

15:13.458 --> 15:16.500
[Baloo] I really put a fire out.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.083
How will we cook the pizzas
without the oven?

15:20.166 --> 15:22.083
We'll...

15:22.166 --> 15:23.667
Hmm...

15:25.083 --> 15:28.458
[Baloo] Only one way
to cook 200 pizzas in five minutes.

15:28.542 --> 15:29.917
All set?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.959
Ready when you are.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.250
[Baloo] Guaranteed hot or your money back.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.125
It takes a hot pilot
to fly through a volcano.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.875
How much longer, Baloo?

15:50.959 --> 15:53.625
I'm starting to feel like an anchovy.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.875
I hate anchovies.

15:55.959 --> 15:58.625
If you can't stand the heat,

15:58.709 --> 16:00.125
bail out of the kitchen.

16:01.542 --> 16:02.959
I smell something.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.500
Sulfur and brimstone?

16:05.583 --> 16:07.834
No, it's hot peperoni...

16:07.917 --> 16:10.750
And one with anchovies.

16:10.834 --> 16:14.041
Ha ha ha! The pizza's done!

16:14.125 --> 16:15.333
We did it, kiddo!

16:22.083 --> 16:25.250
The pizzas are too heavy!

16:25.333 --> 16:28.542
It must be the extra cheese!

16:32.291 --> 16:34.500
We've got to dump those pizzas!

16:34.583 --> 16:38.458
If we dump them, our business goes bust.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.875
Would you rather be bust or dust?

16:40.959 --> 16:43.709
OK, jettison something.

16:43.792 --> 16:46.000
Now you're talking.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.250
Don't touch those pizzas!

16:52.792 --> 16:55.750
Hey! Not my bottle cap collection!

16:57.125 --> 16:58.750
Uh-oh.

16:58.834 --> 16:59.917
Baloo!

17:00.000 --> 17:03.792
I think we gave the volcano indigestion.

17:03.875 --> 17:08.625
Peperoni might have given it an ulcer.

17:08.709 --> 17:11.165
Except for the pizzas,

17:11.250 --> 17:15.375
this ice is all that's not nailed down.

17:15.458 --> 17:18.709
Did you say ice?

17:18.791 --> 17:21.375
When I tell you,
ditch that cube overboard.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.666
Ready.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.959
[Baloo] Let her rip!

17:26.040 --> 17:27.125
Wait a second.

17:27.208 --> 17:30.000
[Kit] Isn't that going to make steam?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.500
[Baloo] Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:32.583 --> 17:35.000
[screaming]

17:35.083 --> 17:36.792
Nose up, Baloo!

17:36.875 --> 17:38.959
Which way is up?

17:39.041 --> 17:42.542
Huh. I've been looking for this
since last month.

17:46.917 --> 17:48.667
We made it.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.291
Hey.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.500
No sweat.

17:51.583 --> 17:54.250
[Baloo] Now to deliver these pizzas

17:54.333 --> 17:56.250
without Rebecca seeing us.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.083
Yeow!

17:58.166 --> 18:00.041
[man] Business is competition,

18:00.125 --> 18:02.083
it's winners and losers.

18:02.166 --> 18:03.250
Are you losers?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.667
No, sir!

18:04.750 --> 18:05.834
Winners?

18:05.917 --> 18:07.166
Yes, sir!

18:07.250 --> 18:10.542
Let's hear you be lean,
mean business machines!

18:10.625 --> 18:13.375
Grrr!

18:15.834 --> 18:17.333
I just wanted to learn

18:17.458 --> 18:20.208
how to make extra money.

18:20.291 --> 18:21.709
I can't hear you.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.542
Ahem.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.375
Grrr.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.083
Timid, huh?

18:30.166 --> 18:33.542
That namby-pamby stuff won't cut it.

18:33.625 --> 18:37.875
You've got to stand up
and make a big noise.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.166
Aah!

18:43.917 --> 18:46.834
My, that <i>was </i> a big noise.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.750
Ahem. Uh, lunch.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.709
Seminar dismissed.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.792
So far so good, kiddo.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.291
Keep your eyes peeled for--

18:56.375 --> 18:59.166
Did you make one with anchovies?

19:03.959 --> 19:05.083
Whew.

19:05.166 --> 19:08.500
Nobody needs to teach you
how to make money.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.083
Here. $500.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.083
Thanks.

19:13.166 --> 19:16.792
I end the seminar with a free lunch.

19:16.875 --> 19:19.834
It challenges their preconceived notions.

19:19.917 --> 19:21.917
End the seminar?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.959
That means Becky's going back.

19:25.041 --> 19:28.959
We'd better put that dollar back.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.625
She won't care about that

19:31.709 --> 19:33.917
when she sees this.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.709
What happens when she sees the <i>Sea Duck?</i>

19:40.291 --> 19:42.333
All right, kiddo. Start scrubbing.

19:42.417 --> 19:44.625
I'll get more oven cleaner.

19:46.834 --> 19:50.208
What we need is a self-cleaning plane.

19:56.667 --> 19:59.792
I bet the <i>Sea Duck </i> hasn't been that clean

19:59.875 --> 20:01.792
since you flew through a waterfall.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.625
It's worth it to see Becky's face

20:04.709 --> 20:08.291
when she eyeballs this herd.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.625
Talk about being surprised.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.375
Uhh!

20:13.458 --> 20:15.583
Thought you were safe?

20:15.667 --> 20:17.208
I'm with the health department.

20:17.291 --> 20:20.959
I'm throwing the book at you.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.333
For what?

20:23.375 --> 20:27.125
Flying a restaurant without a permit.
$100 fine.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.625
Operating equipment
without a license.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.083
$100 fine.

20:31.166 --> 20:34.083
Dropping tomato sauce over 30 feet.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.667
$200 fine. Not to mention--

20:36.750 --> 20:40.000
What do these fines add up to?

20:40.083 --> 20:42.667
The total comes to $499.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.083
Goodbye, boys.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.834
Write.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.542
Next time you go into business,

20:51.625 --> 20:53.083
check with us first.

20:53.166 --> 20:55.875
We're here to help.

20:55.959 --> 20:58.291
To help yourself to our money.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.792
At least we broke even.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.417
[Becky] Get your hands off!

21:03.542 --> 21:06.458
Dipping into petty cash again?

21:06.542 --> 21:09.458
How was the seminar, Rebecca?

21:09.542 --> 21:11.250
The seminar?

21:11.333 --> 21:13.625
It was interesting.

21:13.709 --> 21:16.625
I learned about making a business growl.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.709
Uh-- grow.

21:17.792 --> 21:21.417
I came up with a great idea.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.417
We had pizza for lunch.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.709
It was delivered by some real losers.

21:25.792 --> 21:28.583
Filthy plane, disgusting delivery people.

21:28.667 --> 21:31.166
Anyway, if a company like that

21:31.250 --> 21:33.166
can make money delivering pizza,

21:33.250 --> 21:36.792
then we could make a fortune!

21:36.875 --> 21:38.875
Baloo? Kit?

21:38.959 --> 21:40.458
Ohh...

21:40.542 --> 21:43.417
Some people just can't handle success.
