00:41.124 --> 00:42.046
Oh, man!

00:42.125 --> 00:43.217
All right. What's next?

00:43.293 --> 00:44.340
Let's see.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.262
First, we visit Tree
Trunks for apple pie,

00:46.338 --> 00:48.511
and then we go to Bubblegum's
science music thing.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.467
Wait... what about the
movie at the drive-in?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.645
That's after we make
dream sandwiches.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.392
Whoo! Let's go!

00:54.471 --> 00:55.472
Apple pie!

00:55.556 --> 00:56.556
Whoo!

00:59.017 --> 00:59.813
Tree Trunks!

00:59.893 --> 01:00.894
Huh?

01:00.978 --> 01:02.525
- T.T.!
- Tree Trunks!

01:02.604 --> 01:04.857
Oh, my, look who's here.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.283
Yoo-hoo!

01:06.358 --> 01:07.234
Whoa!

01:07.317 --> 01:08.409
Oh. yeah!

01:08.485 --> 01:10.829
Howdy, Jake. Howdy, Finn.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.497
Hello.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.790
What are you doing here?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.583
I never really left.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.128
Mr. Pig's been so kind,

01:18.203 --> 01:22.549
helping me tend to
my rose garden.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.381
Hmm.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.302
Cool.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.378
Cool, cool.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.513
Cool, cool, cool.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.933
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.220
Oh, you.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.681
Where's the apple
pie, Tree Trunks?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.061
Yeah, my stomach is
jonesin' for it bad.

01:40.559 --> 01:44.780
Oh, you all are so early
that I haven't even started.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.401
Ahh, ha.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.157
I love her so much.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.704
Whoa! You love her?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.122
What? No!

01:54.197 --> 01:55.289
You just said you love her.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.867
You're crazy.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.543
Dude, come on. We heard you.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.042
I think I am in love with her!

02:02.122 --> 02:03.749
But I don't know how
to go about it.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.476
Dude, you should just
tell her how you feel.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.797
Whew.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.471
What are you boys
chatting about?

02:09.545 --> 02:11.844
Hmm?

02:11.923 --> 02:13.846
Uh-huh. All right. Okay.

02:15.510 --> 02:20.107
Miss Tree Trunks, ma'am, today
I wish to speak my feelings.

02:20.182 --> 02:23.061
Mr. Pig, what's going on?

02:24.770 --> 02:27.649
When I see you, my heart beats
like a choo-choo train.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.610
When you stand near me, I get
so nervous, I cannot move...

02:30.692 --> 02:32.410
Ohhh.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.324
Mm, that's good.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.454
Shush.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.080
I feel the same.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.878
I have a feeling
that this feeling

02:41.953 --> 02:46.459
is what others call "love."

02:46.541 --> 02:48.543
What should we do, then?

02:48.627 --> 02:49.970
We should hug.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.886
Tree Trunks, you gonna
bring some apple pie to

02:53.965 --> 02:55.467
Princess Bubblegum's thing?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.928
Uh, yeah, Jake, yeah.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.514
Well, okay.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.065
See ya later, then.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.517
Mmm.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.408
Bonk, beep, woomp,
wowoow, bing-bong, shoo,

03:12.484 --> 03:13.906
da-be-dop-dop, ooh.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.913
Where is she?

03:19.449 --> 03:20.871
You givin' me a back rub, Bro?

03:20.951 --> 03:21.827
What?

03:21.910 --> 03:24.459
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.919
Hmmmmmraa!

03:26.998 --> 03:27.998
Is that...

03:28.875 --> 03:30.752
It's Tree Trunks!

03:33.380 --> 03:36.384
Pie! Pie! Lay it right here!

03:36.466 --> 03:38.889
Oh, Jake, I tried to
bake an apple pie,

03:38.969 --> 03:42.269
but this cutie kept
distracting me.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.361
No apple pie?!

03:50.897 --> 03:52.820
This is making me uncomfortable.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.697
They are snuggling too long.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.073
What is happening?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.279
I forgot my glasses.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.371
Huh? Oh, gross.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.330
Hyah!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.710
Break it up! Break it up!

04:07.789 --> 04:09.291
Okay, the love show is over.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.876
Princess, please continue.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.006
Hmm.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.070
This is too much!

04:32.314 --> 04:34.487
Aaaaah! Aaaah!

04:34.566 --> 04:36.660
It's driving me crazy!

04:36.735 --> 04:39.113
Cinnamon Bun, do something!

04:39.196 --> 04:40.869
Okay.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.290
Hey, everyone!

04:42.365 --> 04:44.288
The concert is over!

04:44.367 --> 04:45.584
That's not what I...

04:45.660 --> 04:48.334
The concert's over, Princess!

04:50.123 --> 04:55.220
Princess, how's about a
slow song so me and my man

04:55.295 --> 04:57.389
can dance cheek-to-cheek?

05:02.511 --> 05:03.854
Humph!

05:13.980 --> 05:14.902
Humph!

05:14.981 --> 05:16.198
Err!

05:16.274 --> 05:19.778
Why is everybody givin'
me the hairy eyeball?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.863
Y'all are too affectionate.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.042
It makes people feel bothered
when you and the pig flaunt

05:25.116 --> 05:26.538
your affection in public.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.167
They don't want us to
flaunt what we have?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.340
You two need to hide your love,

05:31.414 --> 05:35.385
Or else you'll end up making
the whole world throw up.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.340
We promise to keep our
affection hidden.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.765
Thank you.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.850
Have you seen my other shoe?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.728
I think I saw it in the closet.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.526
Aah! Under my shoe?!

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
Outta here!

06:06.533 --> 06:08.160
This carriage is for babies!

06:09.953 --> 06:11.296
For babies!

06:21.590 --> 06:23.092
Nice stacks of sandwiches.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.097
You shouldn't have
bought so many flavors.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.146
I had to make a sandwich for
each flavor and for each flavor

06:28.221 --> 06:29.313
combination.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.767
I'm making a cheese sandwich.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch!

06:31.850 --> 06:32.692
Mwah!

06:32.767 --> 06:33.768
Ugh.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.446
Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on!

06:36.521 --> 06:40.947
We're trying to hide our
love, but it's so difficult.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.029
Try harder!

06:46.781 --> 06:48.509
Doesn't look like Tree
Trunks and Pig are around.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.332
Yeah, looks like the
coast is clear.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.463
Look at this cup!

06:54.539 --> 06:56.462
Now look at this cup!

06:56.541 --> 06:57.713
Look at this one!

06:59.544 --> 07:00.544
Oh, man!

07:01.671 --> 07:03.024
Just try to ignore it
and watch the movie.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.140
I can't ignore <i>that!</i>

07:10.555 --> 07:14.605
Stop!

07:16.436 --> 07:18.234
Tree Trunks, this has
gone on long enough.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.157
No more spending time with
the Pig unless you do it...

07:21.232 --> 07:23.735
inside your own home.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.617
But, Finn, an unmarried couple

07:26.696 --> 07:28.869
living together
under one roof...

07:28.949 --> 07:30.622
That's indecent!

07:30.700 --> 07:33.419
Then why don't you two
just get married?

07:33.495 --> 07:35.122
We don't want to rush things.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.707
- Marriage is a big step.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.142
- We need time to get
to know each other.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.464
Then I guess we only
have one option.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.928
All right.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.347
You can't do this.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.765
Wait. No! Stop!

07:47.384 --> 07:48.260
Take them away!

07:48.343 --> 07:49.595
Sweet meat!

07:49.678 --> 07:52.181
Little dove!

07:52.263 --> 07:53.640
Sorry, Tree Trunks.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.353
So, where do you live?

07:58.436 --> 07:59.779
I'm homeless.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.731
Oh.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.281
I guess I'll just go back
to eating criminals.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.573
Ugh!

08:10.657 --> 08:13.581
Guh! I miss her!

08:15.078 --> 08:17.922
I don't know what I'm gonna
do without him, Finn.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.296
