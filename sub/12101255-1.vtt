02:34.914 --> 02:35.781
Hello.

02:39.819 --> 02:40.685
Hello.

02:43.022 --> 02:45.825
Ah, welcome.
You're a little late.

02:45.858 --> 02:47.126
Am I? Sorry.

02:47.159 --> 02:49.729
Oh no, it's
fine. How's the town?

02:49.762 --> 02:52.064
Yeah, it's quieting down now.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.467
Food is arriving on time.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.904
Think, I mean I was only there
a day form the transit, so.

02:57.937 --> 02:59.704
Good, good.
Normal is what we want.

02:59.739 --> 03:03.142
I know Bristol took a bad
hit after the third wave, but-

03:03.175 --> 03:04.777
- Yes. Well this is Dr. Jarrek,

03:04.810 --> 03:06.611
he's handling
lockdown procedures.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.147
Dr. Jarrek.
Martin Lowery.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.916
Nice to have a
new face with us.

03:09.949 --> 03:11.183
- Yeah.
- It's been awhile.

03:11.217 --> 03:12.651
It's nice
to see new faces.

03:12.684 --> 03:13.920
Welcome to the lodge.

03:13.953 --> 03:16.122
It looks terrible,
but cost a fortune.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.091
We've been closed for
nearly a year now.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.193
Just want to get open again.

03:21.227 --> 03:22.862
And you own it, right?

03:22.895 --> 03:25.798
Yes, well, the woods are
leased to the government

03:25.831 --> 03:27.133
during the crisis.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.801
How many projects
have we got running here

03:28.834 --> 03:29.869
at the moment, Frank?

03:29.902 --> 03:31.203
Nine, including yours.

03:31.237 --> 03:32.071
Yeah.

03:33.806 --> 03:36.541
Oh, usually this would be
teaming with holiday makers.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.978
They're drawn to
it from all over.

03:41.213 --> 03:43.015
Well, it's appreciated.

03:43.049 --> 03:44.884
We really couldn't
do the research

03:44.917 --> 03:46.518
we're doing without
your cooperation.

03:46.551 --> 03:47.619
So thank you.

03:47.652 --> 03:48.653
It's all to the good, isn't it?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.189
Yeah.

03:50.222 --> 03:51.589
Fashdale Institute grants are
keeping us going.

03:51.623 --> 03:53.692
so long may it last.

03:53.726 --> 03:56.594
Sorry, what specifically
are you working?

03:57.930 --> 04:00.665
Well, actually
it's Dr. Wendell's project.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.533
Sorry?

04:01.566 --> 04:02.234
A colleague.

04:03.936 --> 04:05.871
She's researching ways of
making crops more efficient

04:05.905 --> 04:07.974
through the study
of mycorrhizal.

04:08.007 --> 04:09.674
Oh, yeah, that was it.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.178
Grows on roots forming
networks, that kind of thing.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.746
Yeah, kind of.

04:13.779 --> 04:16.015
Funny place to
study crops in a forest.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.582
Well, no, actually
it's very special land

04:17.615 --> 04:18.516
you have here.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.718
It's unusually fertile.

04:19.752 --> 04:22.721
Sorry about
all this fuss.

04:22.755 --> 04:24.290
No, no, it's
a delicate ecosystem.

04:24.323 --> 04:25.758
You can't be too careful.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.692
Mm! Mainly we don't
want to get sick.

04:27.727 --> 04:29.028
So have you got some
paperwork for me?

04:29.061 --> 04:29.929
Yes.

04:34.599 --> 04:35.835
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.237
So I don't want to be maudlin,

04:38.270 --> 04:42.875
but a couple of people
died in the village and,

04:43.876 --> 04:45.811
It really brought it all home.

04:51.784 --> 04:53.285
It's very quiet here.

04:53.319 --> 04:54.854
Hmm. Here you go.

04:56.022 --> 04:57.957
Could you direct
me to your toilet.

04:59.158 --> 05:01.027
Yeah. Straight down
there on the right.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.061
Thank you.

05:20.678 --> 05:22.982
Here you go, it's all done.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.729
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

05:36.762 --> 05:37.629
Dr. Lowery?

05:37.662 --> 05:38.297
Yeah.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.832
I'm Alma.

05:39.865 --> 05:41.267
I'm gonna be guiding
you out to ATU 3278,

05:41.300 --> 05:42.935
Doctor Wendle's site.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.204
It's just Martin. You
don't have to do the.

05:45.237 --> 05:46.704
Do you want one?

05:46.739 --> 05:48.908
Oh yes, please. Thank you.

05:50.943 --> 05:53.711
Do you have any
coffee by any chance?

05:53.746 --> 05:56.115
Yeah. Yeah.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.350
- Oh.
- I think. Yes.

05:58.384 --> 06:00.119
Thank you so much.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.821
It's been months.

06:06.258 --> 06:08.027
You're worried
she's gonna get you?

06:09.428 --> 06:12.865
Yeah. Who is Parnag Fegg?

06:12.898 --> 06:14.967
- Parnag Fegg.
- Parnag Fegg,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.402
It's a local folktale.

06:16.435 --> 06:17.903
Oh, right?

06:17.937 --> 06:19.637
She's the
spirit of the woods.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.140
Oh.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.408
Yeah, well, it's
something to tell the kids,

06:22.441 --> 06:23.843
stops them wandering off.

06:24.877 --> 06:26.245
Jesus.

06:26.278 --> 06:27.780
They had a few
go missing in the '70s.

06:27.813 --> 06:29.882
So, this helps keep
them a bit more aware.

06:29.915 --> 06:31.383
All right. So it's not
like people believe in it.

06:31.417 --> 06:32.284
It's just a-

06:33.819 --> 06:36.388
- I don't even know
how old that image is.

06:36.422 --> 06:38.057
That's just something
they picked up along

06:38.090 --> 06:40.059
with the rest of the
decoration around here.

06:41.727 --> 06:43.729
I think the forest is like
something that you can sense.

06:43.762 --> 06:46.866
So it makes sense
that they should give

06:46.899 --> 06:48.834
that feeling of face, you know?

06:48.868 --> 06:49.902
Yeah, I guess so.

06:49.935 --> 06:51.137
I mean, thank you.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.705
Are we sure she helped people?

06:53.739 --> 06:57.343
Because I mean,
there's all kinds of-

06:57.376 --> 06:58.811
- Martin Lowery

06:58.844 --> 07:00.746
Bad things going
on in this picture.

07:00.779 --> 07:02.982
I'm sure I recognize
that name from somewhere.

07:04.316 --> 07:05.985
It's not an uncommon name,

07:06.018 --> 07:07.753
there's another Martin
Lowery in my school actually.

07:07.786 --> 07:08.454
Really?

07:08.487 --> 07:10.722
Yeah, he hated me.

07:10.756 --> 07:12.291
So we're leaving first
thing tomorrow morning.

07:12.324 --> 07:13.792
Great. How far is it?

07:13.826 --> 07:16.795
ATU 3278, it's about
two days on foot.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.299
Wait, is
there no other way?

07:20.332 --> 07:21.400
What? Like a
boss or something?

07:21.433 --> 07:25.137
Who knows, quad bikes?

07:25.171 --> 07:27.773
Nope. Just a long walk.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.315
Hey, results
have come through.

07:36.348 --> 07:37.082
- Great.
- You're all clear.

07:37.116 --> 07:38.117
Brilliant.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.285
Just a couple of questions.

07:40.853 --> 07:42.788
That's good discipline,
writing a diary.

07:42.821 --> 07:43.688
Yeah.

07:45.858 --> 07:49.061
Now I don't want you to
over exerting yourself.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.464
The report said you have
had ringworm recently.

07:52.498 --> 07:54.200
Yeah. I don't know
where that came from.

07:54.233 --> 07:56.368
It's a pretty harmless fungus.

07:56.402 --> 07:57.803
Cleared up now?

07:57.836 --> 07:59.071
About
a week ago. Yeah.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.873
How long have you
been in isolation?

08:02.274 --> 08:04.176
About four months,
but I've been exercising

08:04.210 --> 08:06.111
and keeping on top of it.

08:08.781 --> 08:11.050
We've had to send a rescue
party in to get a group out

08:11.083 --> 08:14.220
a couple of months
ago, they got lost.

08:14.253 --> 08:16.355
Thought they could
find their way.

08:16.388 --> 08:18.057
Went without a ranger,

08:18.090 --> 08:20.125
panicked, arrogant really.

08:20.159 --> 08:21.894
Why didn't they use GPRS?

08:21.927 --> 08:24.096
There's no phone
reception in there.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.132
Of course, yeah,
I knew that.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.401
People get a bit funny
in the wood sometimes.

08:29.435 --> 08:30.302
Nerves.

08:32.871 --> 08:34.273
Sounds almost superstitious.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.843
And they would do
well to be afraid.

08:37.876 --> 08:39.745
It is a hostile environment.

08:44.516 --> 08:45.384
Okay.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.867
It doesn't look hostile to me.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.436
Is that it?

09:38.304 --> 09:39.505
Yeah.

09:40.906 --> 09:42.041
Okay.

09:42.074 --> 09:43.542
- Ready?
- Sure.

10:37.196 --> 10:39.898
Nobody's heard
from Dr. Wendle since April.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.468
Usually, we get written notes
she leaves in drop boxes.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.105
Yeah. She likes the quiet.

10:46.138 --> 10:47.406
You know her personally?

10:47.439 --> 10:49.074
I do, yeah.

10:49.108 --> 10:50.376
We worked closely together at

10:50.409 --> 10:52.211
Harringdon Research
Laboratories.

10:53.245 --> 10:54.179
That was years ago.

10:55.114 --> 10:56.482
I moved on to another project.

10:58.050 --> 11:00.119
And she ask you to come out?

11:00.152 --> 11:01.387
No, I requested.

11:02.521 --> 11:04.256
Not someone from our own team.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.024
Well, the Flashdale
research groups

11:06.058 --> 11:07.259
are pretty thinly stretched.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.995
And I've worked as a
soil sampler.

11:10.028 --> 11:10.996
I know her research.

11:11.029 --> 11:14.400
So made sense.

11:25.077 --> 11:26.145
What is that?

11:29.749 --> 11:31.984
We've got a little bird
life that you don't hear

11:32.017 --> 11:33.585
in the rest of the country.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.025
Uh right.

12:13.058 --> 12:13.725
Me too.

12:23.101 --> 12:25.137
Everyone's good at something.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.572
Some people are
good at some things,

12:26.605 --> 12:27.740
other people are
good at other things.

12:27.774 --> 12:28.640
It's normal.

12:29.675 --> 12:31.009
It's completely normal.

12:32.779 --> 12:35.214
Growing up in a city I don't
know how to do this things.

12:35.247 --> 12:36.615
Okay.

12:36.648 --> 12:37.549
Can I help.

12:37.583 --> 12:38.183
You've finished yours?

12:39.752 --> 12:41.086
Yeah, I have finished mine.

12:41.119 --> 12:42.087
But let's set yours up.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.155
It's gonna get dark soon.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.411
I know where I know
your name from.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.648
Where?

13:09.681 --> 13:12.251
Letters I picked
up from Dr. Wendle.

13:12.284 --> 13:14.152
She wrote to you a lot.

13:16.121 --> 13:17.689
Yeah, we kept
in correspondence.

13:19.458 --> 13:23.328
All last year and
then it just stopped.

13:23.362 --> 13:26.766
Conversations just run
their course, don't they?

14:14.713 --> 14:18.851
I lied to Dr. Jarred, I
haven't been exercising.

14:18.885 --> 14:22.287
I just,
couldn't face it.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.787
Odd.

14:56.889 --> 14:58.758
Could have blown in.

15:06.398 --> 15:08.667
Wait, there's someone there.

15:30.689 --> 15:33.291
I saw a camp like this once.

15:35.928 --> 15:37.562
Family they,

15:40.900 --> 15:41.968
they came out

15:42.001 --> 15:43.502
into the woods, got sick and-

15:50.977 --> 15:53.478
- How far are we away
from Dr. Wendle's camp?

15:53.512 --> 15:54.279
Um...

15:56.648 --> 15:58.450
15 Miles.

15:58.483 --> 16:01.687
Right so, we're
already on top of it.

16:04.523 --> 16:05.691
On top of what?

16:08.828 --> 16:10.696
The mycorrhizal mat.

16:10.730 --> 16:15.500
It connects and controls all
of these, all of these trees.

16:15.534 --> 16:17.369
I read about that
in her research.

16:20.539 --> 16:22.374
She made it sound like a brain.

16:22.407 --> 16:26.344
Yeah. Yeah I suppose it is.

16:30.482 --> 16:31.349
Should we-

17:14.093 --> 17:15.660
wait.

17:15.694 --> 17:19.732
Hang on a second and
just wait for a moment.

17:38.885 --> 17:39.752
What?

17:43.089 --> 17:45.024
You look like you're
a million miles away.

17:47.692 --> 17:48.693
Yeah, it's just odd

17:50.930 --> 17:53.900
Being outside for the
first time in months.

17:53.933 --> 17:56.535
It's just hard to take
it all in actually.

17:59.504 --> 18:00.472
Well things will get
going back to normal

18:00.505 --> 18:01.606
quicker than you think.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.442
Everyone will forget
what happened.

18:06.511 --> 18:08.446
No, I don't think
anyone will forget.

18:12.151 --> 18:13.085
Yeah, they will.

18:14.586 --> 18:16.354
They'll just get back
to their old ways.

18:19.125 --> 18:20.860
Why'd you leave the
Harringdon facility?

18:22.762 --> 18:24.096
Sorry, what?

18:24.130 --> 18:26.032
Before you said you
worked with Dr. Wendle

18:26.065 --> 18:27.099
at the Harringdon facility?

18:27.133 --> 18:28.067
Yeah.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.401
Why'd you leave?

18:29.434 --> 18:31.369
Personal reasons.

19:40.206 --> 19:41.040
Get them up.

21:05.891 --> 21:06.759
Alma?

21:22.008 --> 21:22.875
Alma?

21:29.048 --> 21:29.915
Alma.

21:32.351 --> 21:34.286
Stay still, stay still.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.789
Are you hurt?

21:42.194 --> 21:43.029
Get up.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.533
Oh my face.

22:02.348 --> 22:04.716
Walk over here it's easier.

22:05.885 --> 22:07.719
Why would
they take our shoes?

22:08.821 --> 22:10.122
Lucky
that's all they took.

22:11.223 --> 22:13.826
Taunting us,
smashing up the radio.

22:15.227 --> 22:18.130
Do you think it has anything
to do with the tent we found?

22:21.699 --> 22:24.170
I don't know.

22:24.203 --> 22:25.237
Huh?

22:25.271 --> 22:26.939
I said I don't know.

22:28.407 --> 22:30.009
Fucking shit.

22:34.013 --> 22:34.880
Shit.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.785
Oh, fuck!

22:39.819 --> 22:40.652
What happened?

22:40.685 --> 22:41.921
Oh shit!

22:41.954 --> 22:42.988
What have you done?

22:44.123 --> 22:45.091
Let me have a-

22:45.124 --> 22:45.991
- Oh. Fuck it's bleeding.

22:46.025 --> 22:46.959
It's something sharp.

22:55.434 --> 22:56.302
How bad is it?

22:56.335 --> 22:58.003
Lift it up.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.679
Thank you, sorry.

23:19.925 --> 23:21.160
Stay here.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.429
I'm gonna try and
look for a crutch.

24:02.434 --> 24:03.335
Wait, wait.

24:06.238 --> 24:07.106
What?

24:12.745 --> 24:14.747
Someone's watching us.

24:18.384 --> 24:19.251
Listen.

24:27.159 --> 24:28.894
There are no animals.

24:30.229 --> 24:31.964
Why
are they so quiet?

24:37.503 --> 24:39.238
They sense something.

24:46.946 --> 24:47.813
Let's keep going.

25:16.008 --> 25:17.543
Do you know him?

25:17.576 --> 25:18.444
No.

25:22.014 --> 25:22.948
What should we do?

25:47.206 --> 25:48.440
Someone stole our shoes.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.979
Yeah. I see that.

25:55.047 --> 25:56.448
What are you doing out here?

25:58.450 --> 26:00.419
I saw you limping
about and I thought,

26:01.320 --> 26:02.454
"I should help them."

26:03.989 --> 26:05.324
And then I thought
you were a park ranger

26:05.357 --> 26:07.326
and you probably don't
want me living out here.

26:12.197 --> 26:13.165
But here you are.

26:17.336 --> 26:18.570
Couldn't in good
conscience let you limp

26:18.604 --> 26:19.805
around on your own.

26:20.572 --> 26:21.440
Could get hurt.

26:24.009 --> 26:25.344
I won't tell if you won't.

26:29.348 --> 26:30.582
That's very kind of you.

26:34.219 --> 26:35.054
I'm Martin.

26:36.355 --> 26:37.222
I'm Alma.

26:38.957 --> 26:39.825
Zach.

26:41.527 --> 26:44.163
I presume you came through
quarantine at the Gantalow Lodge.

26:46.465 --> 26:48.267
So let's keep our distance, hey?

26:48.300 --> 26:49.168
Yes.

26:53.972 --> 26:55.941
Can't be too careful.

26:59.011 --> 27:01.947
Man and a woman
attacked me yesterday.

27:03.449 --> 27:04.850
Did they have a child?

27:08.120 --> 27:09.054
I didn't see one.

27:11.557 --> 27:14.660
We found an abandoned
camp, it had toys.

27:14.693 --> 27:15.994
Maybe they moved on.

27:19.365 --> 27:22.334
I've got some shoes
if you want them.

27:22.368 --> 27:23.869
I think it will fit.

27:26.538 --> 27:27.873
Yeah, that'd be great.

27:30.142 --> 27:32.144
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Thank you.

27:32.177 --> 27:33.145
Follow me.

27:48.560 --> 27:52.364
Wow, it's big.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.069
Yeah, I've been busy.

27:59.571 --> 28:01.673
It's a liberation to
build your own shelter.

28:06.044 --> 28:07.379
What's in there?

28:07.413 --> 28:09.281
Oh, that's just my workshop.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.382
Through here.

28:15.554 --> 28:16.955
- Thank you.
- All right?

28:19.691 --> 28:20.626
You just wait here.

28:31.703 --> 28:34.173
Do you
go to the town?

28:34.206 --> 28:36.208
For supplies, once
every couple of months

28:36.241 --> 28:37.509
I like it less every time.

28:39.478 --> 28:40.379
Let's have
a look at this.

28:40.412 --> 28:41.246
How is it?

28:41.280 --> 28:42.648
Oh my, yeah.

28:42.681 --> 28:43.582
Let's have a look.

28:43.615 --> 28:45.484
Ooh! That is nasty.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.219
Got any disinfectant?

28:47.252 --> 28:49.188
Yeah, yeah. No, I think I
need to wash and stitch it.

28:51.123 --> 28:52.291
Stitch?

28:52.324 --> 28:53.959
Yeah. It's
flapping about.

28:55.527 --> 28:57.095
Can't find my bits and boots.

28:59.097 --> 29:00.999
You'll be fine. I'm sure
he knows what he's doing.

29:01.033 --> 29:01.667
It's okay.

29:03.502 --> 29:04.503
All right.

29:05.637 --> 29:07.239
All right, this is gonna sting.

29:08.340 --> 29:09.475
Don't worry about that.

29:09.508 --> 29:11.677
Fatal. There we go.

29:12.711 --> 29:13.780
There we are.

29:13.813 --> 29:15.447
- Fuck.
- Burn? Okay.

29:16.749 --> 29:17.616
Clean.

29:19.451 --> 29:23.121
Right, don't worry.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.390
I have done this before.

29:26.258 --> 29:28.527
I mean, on my self.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.729
I'm always getting
caught on things.

29:29.762 --> 29:31.196
Right, hold his foot.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.064
- Ready?
- Yeah.

29:33.131 --> 29:34.566
Just one moment. Hold it still.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.301
Yes, yes, yes.

29:37.703 --> 29:40.706
Oh god, oh god. Oh god!

29:40.740 --> 29:41.673
Okay, good.

29:44.209 --> 29:46.545
- That's it.
- It's okay, it's almost done.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.513
See it's-

29:53.285 --> 29:54.152
There.

29:55.587 --> 29:56.555
And again.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.524
You're doing really well.

29:58.557 --> 30:00.192
That's it. Keep
talking to him?

30:00.225 --> 30:01.093
Yeah.

30:06.098 --> 30:08.400
Good. Couple more.

30:09.836 --> 30:11.136
It's okay. It's okay.

30:12.638 --> 30:13.505
Last one.

30:16.843 --> 30:17.709
Done.

30:19.244 --> 30:20.579
Now, food.

30:28.453 --> 30:29.354
How's it look?

30:29.388 --> 30:31.189
Yeah, fine. It's okay.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.460
Right. Let's
see what I can rustle up.

30:36.395 --> 30:37.229
Can I help?

30:37.262 --> 30:38.096
No, it's fine.

30:39.431 --> 30:42.735
I haven't got much.
it's mostly forage.

30:42.769 --> 30:44.269
- Soak in.
- Thank you.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.405
- I'll get you a spoon.
- Thank you so much.

30:46.438 --> 30:48.808
Brilliant. Thank you.

30:48.841 --> 30:51.276
Thank you.
You're welcome.

30:54.313 --> 30:55.815
Oh, that's good.

30:55.848 --> 30:57.482
- That's really good.
- Good.

30:58.517 --> 30:59.718
A Zach special

30:59.752 --> 31:01.754
See what you make of that.

31:04.323 --> 31:05.324
Hmm, what is that?

31:05.357 --> 31:06.859
- Nice?
- Yeah.

31:06.893 --> 31:08.728
Sweet sort
of an elder.. flower.

31:08.761 --> 31:12.264
Not elderflower,
but same principle.

31:12.297 --> 31:13.432
Some-

31:13.465 --> 31:15.167
- It's delicious.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.568
Yeah. Here's the
petals of various plants.

31:16.602 --> 31:18.637
It took a while to get
the right consistency,

31:18.670 --> 31:19.571
but this is nice, isn't it?

31:19.605 --> 31:23.241
It's like a sweet...
Like a barley sugar.

31:23.275 --> 31:24.142
- Yeah.
- Hmm!

31:25.377 --> 31:26.345
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:26.378 --> 31:27.747
Cheers!

31:27.780 --> 31:29.181
Well, very
nice to meet you.

31:29.214 --> 31:30.850
Even in such strange
circumstances.

31:36.288 --> 31:37.155
Good.

31:38.925 --> 31:39.792
Oh God!

31:41.460 --> 31:42.594
You got
to stay hydrated.

31:42.628 --> 31:43.695
Oh no I'm fine, thanks.

31:43.730 --> 31:46.733
You sure? Now go on and
have a little bit more.

31:46.766 --> 31:48.400
Always piss clear.

31:49.334 --> 31:50.335
That's my rule.

31:50.369 --> 31:51.370
That was a good one.

31:51.403 --> 31:52.437
Yeah. I know.

31:57.542 --> 31:58.911
Shoes.

31:58.945 --> 32:00.545
Oh, brilliant.

32:00.579 --> 32:02.681
Outside, it
must've been such hard work

32:02.714 --> 32:04.249
without shoes.

32:04.282 --> 32:06.218
Oh thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

32:06.251 --> 32:07.252
Oh, wow!

32:07.285 --> 32:08.755
Oh that's good.

32:08.788 --> 32:10.689
I didn't know how hard it was
walking around barefoot-

32:10.722 --> 32:13.525
- I bet. It must've been such
hard going without shoes.

32:13.558 --> 32:14.726
It really is.

32:14.761 --> 32:15.795
- It is-
- Perfect.

32:20.298 --> 32:22.200
Hope they
fit after all that.

32:23.903 --> 32:24.871
Not bad, good size.

32:24.904 --> 32:26.739
Got trouble doing these up.

32:26.773 --> 32:29.474
- Yeah
- Yeah, I'll bet.

32:29.508 --> 32:30.442
Here we go.

32:34.847 --> 32:37.784
Oh my, I
don't feel very well.

32:47.526 --> 32:48.393
Oh God!

32:51.596 --> 32:53.198
Reassuring words.

32:56.401 --> 32:58.203
Just being kind-

33:01.406 --> 33:02.909
triggers a social response.

33:03.976 --> 33:04.844
Trade of trust.

33:06.012 --> 33:07.546
Oh God!

33:13.652 --> 33:14.519
Shhhh!

33:20.059 --> 33:21.226
You must be sleepy.

33:25.031 --> 33:25.898
You sleepy?

33:28.935 --> 33:30.402
You should rest.

33:33.371 --> 33:34.573
You must be sleepy.

33:37.476 --> 33:38.443
You should rest.

33:40.512 --> 33:41.914
You need some rest.

33:41.948 --> 33:42.849
Shhhh!

33:42.882 --> 33:44.249
Close your eyes Martin.

33:48.653 --> 33:49.654
Where are you going?

33:50.655 --> 33:52.524
Where's she going?

34:01.901 --> 34:02.902
Alma.

34:02.935 --> 34:03.836
No.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.071
Come on. Here we go.

34:06.638 --> 34:07.840
Come on.

36:29.614 --> 36:32.517
Just let,
just let us go.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.987
Hmm, I can't yet.

36:36.088 --> 36:37.622
Look, this is interesting.

36:37.656 --> 36:41.928
Have you ever developed
film? It's fascinating.

36:41.961 --> 36:42.828
Let me show you.

36:54.974 --> 36:59.145
Photography is
like magic, really.

37:03.115 --> 37:05.751
But then, so is all technology

37:05.785 --> 37:07.485
when you don't
know how it works.

37:15.627 --> 37:16.561
What is that?

37:33.279 --> 37:35.014
Is that us?

37:36.614 --> 37:37.750
You should relax.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.119
I'm not hurting you.

37:42.587 --> 37:43.756
Just let us go.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.491
I would, but I can't now.

37:47.193 --> 37:48.060
Not possible.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.567
What have you done?

37:55.600 --> 37:56.902
I'm marking you, Martin.

37:59.105 --> 38:00.206
So that he can see you.

38:02.640 --> 38:07.612
Don't worry, I've got them too.

38:12.785 --> 38:15.687
Can you feel him
now, in the earth?

38:20.126 --> 38:23.763
No. No I don't
know what you mean.

38:24.263 --> 38:25.798
I think you do.

38:26.799 --> 38:28.200
I don't.

38:29.735 --> 38:30.702
Just wait, wait-

38:30.736 --> 38:32.238
- Here we go. Shsshh shhhs.

38:32.271 --> 38:33.305
Her we go, come on.

38:33.339 --> 38:35.673
Come on, come on, that's it.

38:35.707 --> 38:37.642
Swallow, swallow, swallow.

39:29.095 --> 39:30.830
How are you faring?

39:30.863 --> 39:31.730
What?

39:34.767 --> 39:36.969
How are you
faring? You good?

39:37.002 --> 39:38.003
Settling in?

39:38.904 --> 39:40.840
Please Zach.

39:40.873 --> 39:42.141
Don't try and bargain with me.

39:42.174 --> 39:43.608
I can't let you see her.

39:45.444 --> 39:47.246
Dr. Wendle?

39:47.279 --> 39:48.581
Yes, Wendle.

39:50.149 --> 39:51.016
Why?

39:52.852 --> 39:55.855
I trusted her, but she has
profoundly misunderstood him.

39:55.888 --> 39:57.689
She wants to enslave
him, but he doesn't care.

39:57.722 --> 39:58.557
Who doesn't care?

39:58.591 --> 39:59.657
She thinks science
appeals to him.

39:59.691 --> 40:00.725
He's not interested.

40:00.759 --> 40:02.261
He likes art, he likes flattery.

40:02.294 --> 40:03.362
Who Zach?

40:03.395 --> 40:04.363
- Sacrifice.
- Who is he?

40:04.396 --> 40:05.998
The thing in the woods.

40:08.134 --> 40:10.236
She thinks she can talk to him,

40:10.269 --> 40:11.669
bargain with him.

40:11.703 --> 40:13.272
I'm talking to him
in a purer way,

40:13.305 --> 40:16.041
making images, praising
him, worshiping him.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.710
Did she not talk about it?

40:20.746 --> 40:23.282
We haven't seen Dr.
Wendle in months, Zach.

40:30.956 --> 40:34.393
I want to believe you
Martin, but people essentially

40:34.426 --> 40:35.294
are the same.

40:37.062 --> 40:40.099
They bargain with what they
have and it doesn't take long

40:40.132 --> 40:41.699
before they get down to it,

40:41.734 --> 40:44.170
to become desperate
and say anything.

40:44.203 --> 40:47.006
Believe me, he has
sent me so many people

40:47.039 --> 40:48.140
in the last few months.

40:49.875 --> 40:51.177
I suppose they're all fleeing
the disease in the city,

40:51.210 --> 40:52.912
but they find their way to me.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.347
Drawn here.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.823
Bet you wish you got your
parents out of the city, Martin?

41:10.829 --> 41:12.131
How'd you know about that?

41:16.502 --> 41:17.369
Your diary.

41:18.971 --> 41:21.240
Lots of good passages in
here, it's very candid.

41:23.242 --> 41:25.511
A lot of boo hoo stuff about
your elderly mother and father.

41:25.544 --> 41:26.779
I'm sorry about that.

41:28.981 --> 41:30.482
A bit of bad luck there.

41:30.516 --> 41:31.917
You've chose the wrong branch
of science to save them.

41:31.951 --> 41:33.085
Please just.

41:34.286 --> 41:35.087
Hey.

41:37.323 --> 41:38.723
What you doing here?

41:44.396 --> 41:45.231
My job.

41:46.265 --> 41:48.367
Oh, forgot.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.236
Managing the forest
for its own good.

41:51.203 --> 41:53.138
I tell you it doesn't need you.

41:53.172 --> 41:54.406
It knows what it wants.

41:55.474 --> 41:56.308
I've seen it.

41:58.811 --> 41:59.445
Seen what?

42:02.047 --> 42:03.515
I've seen it.

42:03.549 --> 42:05.784
I've seen inside the world.

42:05.818 --> 42:07.419
You were drawn here
to live in the land.

42:07.453 --> 42:10.556
Did you ever consider what
the ultimate expression

42:10.589 --> 42:11.757
of that was?

42:13.425 --> 42:17.062
When you completely separated
from the process of humans,

42:17.096 --> 42:21.267
when you return to the
green, to its rhythms,

42:22.368 --> 42:25.504
rather than the
selfish beat of humans.

42:29.908 --> 42:32.044
I'm making flesh what
you know is right.

42:33.178 --> 42:34.546
Your world has shrunk.

42:37.316 --> 42:41.820
Your world is
sleeping and ritual.

42:45.991 --> 42:46.859
Praising him.

42:56.502 --> 42:58.537
I told you I was always
getting caught on things.

43:08.947 --> 43:10.382
He told me his story.

43:10.416 --> 43:12.951
He's persecuted and hounded
through these woods.

43:16.221 --> 43:19.591
They said he was a practicing
necromancer and alchemist.

43:21.960 --> 43:26.198
You know how people
can be intolerant?

43:26.231 --> 43:28.834
All they found was an
ancient standing stone.

43:32.338 --> 43:33.572
He had gone.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.909
Inducted
into the stone.

43:38.310 --> 43:41.080
Transferred into the ancient
matter of the forest.

43:45.517 --> 43:49.488
Over the millennia, people
reported sightings of him.

43:50.989 --> 43:52.524
A stranger was said to
help people who were lost.

43:52.558 --> 43:54.293
He wasn't trying to help,

43:54.326 --> 43:55.494
he was asking for help.

43:56.962 --> 43:57.930
He's trapped here.

44:02.534 --> 44:07.139
I believe I can hear
him coursing in my ears.

44:12.111 --> 44:14.146
I honor him with images.

44:20.285 --> 44:22.221
These are his memories.

45:41.768 --> 45:42.634
Alma.

45:45.637 --> 45:48.106
What?
Alma?

45:49.708 --> 45:51.510
He's gonna kill us.

45:56.281 --> 45:57.282
I think so.

45:58.383 --> 45:59.251
Yeah.

46:03.255 --> 46:05.190
I think he's given
us a smaller dose.

46:05.224 --> 46:06.191
I feel a bit more awake.

46:06.225 --> 46:07.059
Yeah, me too.

46:13.265 --> 46:17.369
He dropped a blade over
there by the table.

46:17.402 --> 46:19.505
Can you see it? Look,
the closest leg to us.

46:22.641 --> 46:24.243
See it?

46:24.276 --> 46:25.143
Oh yeah.

46:28.447 --> 46:29.548
I can get to that.

46:29.581 --> 46:30.449
Yeah?

46:31.851 --> 46:33.652
I can get to that and
then I can cut through.

46:33.685 --> 46:35.721
Yeah, you have
to do something.

46:35.755 --> 46:37.489
And then I'll hit
him with something

46:37.523 --> 46:40.259
and we can both run in
different directions.

46:40.292 --> 46:41.293
Yeah.

46:41.326 --> 46:42.694
No, why different directions?

46:44.296 --> 46:46.098
So now I can lead him away.

46:46.131 --> 46:47.232
You'll be too slow.

46:47.266 --> 46:48.433
Yeah, but what
if he chases me?

46:48.467 --> 46:49.334
He won't.

46:50.602 --> 46:52.504
If I hit him, he's
gonna follow me.

46:52.538 --> 46:53.773
And you just head
towards the sun

46:53.806 --> 46:55.307
and you end up at
Dr. Wendle's camp

46:55.340 --> 46:57.744
and then I can come find you.

46:57.777 --> 46:58.845
Okay.

46:58.878 --> 47:00.747
The sun, follow the sun.

47:24.703 --> 47:25.571
Ow!

47:29.374 --> 47:31.710
Ow!

47:37.215 --> 47:38.150
Yeah. Oh.

47:39.318 --> 47:41.353
What? What?

47:41.386 --> 47:43.856
Okay. Let's put
your foot down.

47:43.890 --> 47:48.828
We've got a bad
situation, Martin.

47:50.529 --> 47:52.130
I think your foot is infected.

47:53.900 --> 47:55.634
So I've got two
courses of action.

47:55.667 --> 47:57.569
I could take you to a hospital,

47:58.637 --> 48:00.272
but I think it
would take too long.

48:00.305 --> 48:03.709
We're 30 miles from
civilization, could take days.

48:04.877 --> 48:08.380
Okay. What's the alternative?

48:11.249 --> 48:12.150
Amputation.

48:13.820 --> 48:16.321
I mean, not whole
foot, just some toes.

48:18.256 --> 48:19.124
Just some toes?

48:20.626 --> 48:24.229
Yeah. Really sorry, but
my axe is pretty sharp.

48:24.262 --> 48:25.330
So you shouldn't really feel it.

48:25.364 --> 48:26.431
Your axe?

48:26.465 --> 48:27.332
Yeah.

48:29.267 --> 48:30.402
Put your foot on there.

48:31.670 --> 48:33.906
Yeah, I dunno.

48:33.940 --> 48:36.575
I think we should go
to the hospital, Zach.

48:36.608 --> 48:40.947
If you struggle, it will
only make it much worse, okay?

48:40.980 --> 48:42.381
Or we should
take him to the hospital.

48:42.414 --> 48:43.615
I think it's-

48:43.649 --> 48:45.651
- I've explained,
there's no time.

48:45.684 --> 48:46.819
It's just I'm not
sure it's that bad-

48:46.853 --> 48:48.286
- This is for the best.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.454
Now, hold still.

48:51.758 --> 48:52.759
Zach, no listen.

48:52.792 --> 48:54.192
Zach, Zach, listen.

48:54.226 --> 48:55.627
I don't think it's
that bad, Zach.

48:55.661 --> 48:57.396
Honestly I'm happy
with it as it is.

48:57.429 --> 48:58.463
It's fine.

48:58.497 --> 48:59.564
- I can deal with it.
- Look.

48:59.598 --> 49:00.933
- It's fine.
- Stop moaning.

49:00.967 --> 49:02.567
- It hurts, but I'm okay.
- I'm not a doctor.

49:02.601 --> 49:02.802
I know you're not a doctor,
that's what I'm saying.

49:03.602 --> 49:04.536
This is for your
own wellbeing.

49:04.569 --> 49:05.905
I know, I know, but
I'm okay like this.

49:05.938 --> 49:06.939
It hurts but I can deal with it.

49:06.973 --> 49:07.673
It's fine-

49:07.706 --> 49:09.207
- It's important that you stop.

49:09.241 --> 49:10.375
Let me concentrate, okay?

49:12.577 --> 49:13.545
Right, okay.

49:13.578 --> 49:15.547
Keep your toes still, okay?

49:15.580 --> 49:17.716
Yeah, but Zach.

49:18.717 --> 49:19.484
Oh, Jesus Christ.

49:21.253 --> 49:22.855
That was just
taking aim, okay?

49:22.889 --> 49:24.824
Just got to get
my bearings, okay?

49:24.857 --> 49:26.291
Listen Zach, Zach maybe,

49:26.324 --> 49:27.325
I think we should just leave it.

49:27.359 --> 49:28.593
What's the matter with you?

49:28.627 --> 49:29.796
Just take
me to a hospital.

49:29.829 --> 49:31.430
What is wrong
with you? Be quiet.

49:31.463 --> 49:33.800
You got to let me
concentrate, okay?

49:34.734 --> 49:36.201
Good, okay, great.

49:37.502 --> 49:38.570
This is the one.

49:38.603 --> 49:39.638
- Oh no, Zach.
- Are you ready?

49:39.671 --> 49:40.572
- Zach, Zach.
- Sit still.

49:40.605 --> 49:41.874
No, no I'm not ready.

49:41.908 --> 49:42.875
Do you really
have to do this?

49:42.909 --> 49:44.409
Martin, brace yourself.

49:46.846 --> 49:47.980
Please Zach. Please, please.

49:48.881 --> 49:49.982
Oh!
Oh!

49:50.016 --> 49:52.250
Missed! And that's your fault.

49:52.284 --> 49:54.553
I can't concentrate with all
this babbling gibbering on.

49:54.586 --> 49:55.620
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Okay?

49:55.654 --> 49:57.757
I'm sorry.

49:59.658 --> 50:01.861
Half off. And that's on you.

50:01.894 --> 50:03.328
Oh fuck!

50:03.361 --> 50:04.463
I told you to hold still.

50:04.496 --> 50:05.832
Yeah but no.

50:05.865 --> 50:07.033
Fuck!

50:07.066 --> 50:07.934
Oh fuck!

52:10.455 --> 52:11.123
Alma.

52:15.027 --> 52:17.495
Alma, please don't leave me.

52:20.066 --> 52:21.167
Please don't leave me.

52:21.200 --> 52:22.068
Please.

52:24.770 --> 52:25.604
Oh my God!

52:33.012 --> 52:34.446
Did you kill him?

52:34.479 --> 52:35.714
I don't know.

52:35.748 --> 52:38.650
I hit him with
something really hard.

52:54.767 --> 52:56.102
Come on.

52:56.135 --> 52:56.969
Where is he?

52:57.003 --> 52:58.670
Oh my God!

52:59.805 --> 53:02.174
Get back in the house.

53:02.208 --> 53:03.843
Alma come on.

53:07.213 --> 53:09.181
Get back here.

53:12.684 --> 53:13.551
Run.

53:16.022 --> 53:16.923
Oh my God!

53:19.724 --> 53:20.692
Shit, shit.

53:22.194 --> 53:23.229
Alma?

53:45.051 --> 53:46.185
Alma.

53:56.528 --> 53:57.863
Hey! Over here.

54:03.202 --> 54:05.503
Martin!

54:19.018 --> 54:19.885
Fuck!

54:21.020 --> 54:22.154
Martin!

54:27.827 --> 54:29.228
Fuck the consequences.

54:29.261 --> 54:30.129
Fuck!

54:37.803 --> 54:40.873
Fuck.

54:40.906 --> 54:42.875
Martin?

55:00.059 --> 55:00.860
Martin?

55:04.964 --> 55:06.966
Is anyone there?

55:06.999 --> 55:09.802
Help me please,
help me, help me.

55:10.803 --> 55:12.905
Who is that?

55:12.938 --> 55:14.306
What are you doing?

55:14.340 --> 55:17.343
Leave immediately, this
is private property.

55:17.376 --> 55:19.045
Martin?

55:32.825 --> 55:34.659
I know you're there.

55:42.368 --> 55:44.170
I know you're there.

55:46.972 --> 55:49.075
You're so easy to track.

55:51.043 --> 55:52.344
Lumbering about.

55:54.847 --> 55:56.015
Galump, galump.

57:33.245 --> 57:35.147
Martin!

58:29.468 --> 58:31.804
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

58:50.122 --> 58:52.191
What do you want from me?

58:53.892 --> 58:56.762
Tell me what you
want I'll do it.

58:57.463 --> 59:00.132
Let me give it to you.

59:17.049 --> 59:18.250
Move quickly.

59:39.338 --> 59:40.906
It's you.

59:44.643 --> 59:45.511
Martin?

59:52.318 --> 59:54.820
Let me get you into the camp.

1:00:00.926 --> 1:00:01.627
Is Alma here?

1:00:01.660 --> 1:00:02.861
She said she'd be here.

1:00:02.895 --> 1:00:04.363
Alma?
The park ranger?

1:00:04.396 --> 1:00:08.033
Yes she was with
me. We have to find her.

1:00:08.067 --> 1:00:08.934
Alma?

1:00:09.668 --> 1:00:11.603
Just hold on. Hold on.

1:00:19.345 --> 1:00:20.212
Alma?

1:00:22.147 --> 1:00:24.183
You stay here and
I'll see if I can find her.

1:00:24.216 --> 1:00:25.451
No, I'll come with you.

1:00:25.484 --> 1:00:26.318
No you're
in no fit state.

1:00:26.352 --> 1:00:28.053
I have to.

1:00:28.087 --> 1:00:29.355
Okay.

1:00:31.523 --> 1:00:34.927
Alma? Alma?

1:00:37.529 --> 1:00:38.564
What?

1:00:38.597 --> 1:00:40.232
I think I can see something.

1:00:40.265 --> 1:00:41.633
Stay here and make sure
she doesn't double back

1:00:41.667 --> 1:00:42.501
around past us.

1:00:42.534 --> 1:00:44.069
Stay there Martin.

1:00:57.282 --> 1:00:57.649
Hello?

1:01:03.622 --> 1:01:04.490
Oh God!

1:01:06.425 --> 1:01:07.426
Who's there?

1:01:12.698 --> 1:01:13.565
Alma?

1:01:14.533 --> 1:01:15.501
It's you.

1:02:01.781 --> 1:02:03.382
You'll have to forgive me,

1:02:03.415 --> 1:02:05.584
I haven't talked to
anybody for a few months.

1:02:08.153 --> 1:02:10.622
Martin, I think we should
take a look at your foot.

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:14.193
I'm so sorry about what
happened to you both.

1:02:14.226 --> 1:02:16.061
There really was no
way of warning you

1:02:16.094 --> 1:02:18.464
about how dangerous the
situation with Zach could become.

1:02:20.365 --> 1:02:22.634
You know he's killed
people that live here.

1:02:25.337 --> 1:02:27.005
- Killed?
- Yeah.

1:02:27.039 --> 1:02:29.074
Maybe one
family, maybe more.

1:02:35.447 --> 1:02:36.315
May I?

1:02:37.784 --> 1:02:39.384
Yeah.

1:02:39.418 --> 1:02:41.653
So, how do you know his name?

1:02:44.523 --> 1:02:46.258
Zach is my ex-husband.

1:02:56.101 --> 1:02:57.536
That needs cauterizing.

1:02:59.137 --> 1:03:00.339
You're going to burn me?

1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:02.307
Yes.

1:03:03.275 --> 1:03:04.576
Wait at a hospital?

1:03:04.610 --> 1:03:06.545
No, no, there
isn't time for that.

1:03:12.684 --> 1:03:14.019
Sorry about before.

1:03:16.655 --> 1:03:21.493
I don't know what
to say actually.

1:03:21.527 --> 1:03:22.394
Don't.

1:03:26.733 --> 1:03:28.267
I said I'd run and find you.

1:03:31.336 --> 1:03:33.171
- It's fine.
- Thank you.

1:03:35.541 --> 1:03:39.044
Last night I saw
something in the woods.

1:03:41.179 --> 1:03:42.114
I don't know what it was.

1:03:42.147 --> 1:03:43.549
It was-

1:03:43.582 --> 1:03:45.284
- I didn't
think anybody was coming.

1:03:45.317 --> 1:03:47.185
When you stopped writing
I started to worry.

1:03:47.219 --> 1:03:49.688
I couldn't speak to you.
I couldn't speak to anybody.

1:03:49.721 --> 1:03:52.624
My initial line of
experimentations failed.

1:03:53.826 --> 1:03:56.261
It was just months and
months of dead ends.

1:03:56.295 --> 1:03:58.697
Alma, can you hold him for me?

1:03:58.731 --> 1:04:00.332
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:04:00.365 --> 1:04:02.735
Shouldn't I have something
to bite down on, or

1:04:04.369 --> 1:04:05.671
just anything?

1:04:10.810 --> 1:04:12.578
Try this.

1:04:12.611 --> 1:04:13.478
Great.

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:20.419
Alma?

1:04:20.452 --> 1:04:21.687
Alma?

1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:22.554
Yeah.

1:04:22.588 --> 1:04:23.823
Hold him.

1:04:50.449 --> 1:04:53.118
Can't tell you how sorry I
am about what's happened.

1:04:55.788 --> 1:04:56.856
It's not your fault.

1:04:58.858 --> 1:05:00.125
You didn't attack us.

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:04.563
Well, Hey.

1:05:07.466 --> 1:05:08.768
Do you have any water?

1:05:08.801 --> 1:05:10.235
On the shelf.

1:05:10.268 --> 1:05:12.304
Oh, I
can't feel anything.

1:05:12.337 --> 1:05:13.238
That's for the best.

1:05:13.271 --> 1:05:14.306
Just try and lay still.

1:05:26.418 --> 1:05:30.288
You said your research,
you said it had stalled.

1:05:31.423 --> 1:05:32.290
Yes.

1:05:33.492 --> 1:05:34.894
Fashdale Institute
wanted results,

1:05:34.927 --> 1:05:35.895
and I had nothing.

1:05:37.897 --> 1:05:41.500
When I found the stone, I
don't know how I missed it.

1:05:41.533 --> 1:05:42.835
It had been there all along.

1:05:42.869 --> 1:05:44.603
I used it to take my
mind off my own work.

1:05:44.636 --> 1:05:47.205
I thought I could shake myself
out of the hole I was in.

1:05:47.239 --> 1:05:48.707
The markings on the
stone led me down

1:05:48.741 --> 1:05:51.510
a rabbit hole of research,
until I found this book.

1:05:51.543 --> 1:05:54.479
This contains amongst other
things an English translation

1:05:54.513 --> 1:05:57.582
of Malleus Maleficarum,
"The Hammer of The Witches."

1:05:57.616 --> 1:05:59.819
The book is dated 1640,

1:05:59.852 --> 1:06:02.922
but some of the pages are much
older and from other books.

1:06:04.289 --> 1:06:07.827
There's a section in
here about this forest.

1:06:07.860 --> 1:06:09.361
Parnag Fegg.

1:06:09.394 --> 1:06:10.863
The name translates
in the local dialect

1:06:10.897 --> 1:06:14.299
as sound, Parnagus
and light, Fegg.

1:06:14.332 --> 1:06:16.234
Heartfelt prayer
and God's light.

1:06:16.268 --> 1:06:19.471
You see, I don't think Parnag
Fegg was a person at all.

1:06:19.504 --> 1:06:23.308
I think it was a process,
but it got me thinking.

1:06:23.341 --> 1:06:24.811
I mean, of course they
wouldn't have gotten anywhere

1:06:24.844 --> 1:06:26.946
with torches and drums,
but with modern equipment,

1:06:26.979 --> 1:06:28.613
maybe I could.

1:06:28.647 --> 1:06:30.783
There's something in there
and it wants to talk.

1:06:30.817 --> 1:06:32.584
Zach came to the forest
to help me set up

1:06:32.617 --> 1:06:33.618
this new experiment.

1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:36.989
But I don't understand,

1:06:37.023 --> 1:06:38.623
why did you get Zach involved?

1:06:39.992 --> 1:06:42.561
Why didn't you ask the board
at the Fashdale Institute?

1:06:43.730 --> 1:06:45.664
They would never
have understood, Alma.

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:48.835
This was all just too
important to risk.

1:07:04.917 --> 1:07:07.820
We need to open this up
and clean it, Martin.

1:07:07.854 --> 1:07:09.922
I think there's
something under the skin.

1:07:12.058 --> 1:07:12.959
It's very tough.

1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:15.862
It's animal gut I think.

1:07:15.895 --> 1:07:16.763
Great.

1:07:18.430 --> 1:07:19.031
Does it hurt?

1:07:19.065 --> 1:07:19.932
Yes.

1:07:34.546 --> 1:07:35.413
Oh fuck.

1:07:37.449 --> 1:07:39.819
I wouldn't try to make
any logical sense of it.

1:07:41.419 --> 1:07:42.454
I need water for this.

1:07:42.487 --> 1:07:43.522
Tell me where I can find it.

1:07:43.555 --> 1:07:44.991
Fine. This is a sterile area.

1:07:45.024 --> 1:07:46.926
I'd like to keep it
that way, thank you.

1:07:48.027 --> 1:07:49.694
Okay.

1:07:49.728 --> 1:07:51.964
Hey, I think

1:07:54.432 --> 1:07:56.334
the scars on my arm

1:07:56.368 --> 1:07:57.870
match the markings
on the stones.

1:07:59.404 --> 1:08:00.438
It's pattern-making.

1:08:01.974 --> 1:08:03.976
Zach is trying to make
meaning where there isn't any.

1:08:05.477 --> 1:08:08.346
It's a psychological
problem with humans.

1:08:08.380 --> 1:08:10.750
You want to make stories
out of everything.

1:08:10.783 --> 1:08:14.686
Zach seems to think that he
can communicate with nature

1:08:14.719 --> 1:08:16.823
through art and worship.

1:08:16.856 --> 1:08:18.523
It's idolatry.

1:08:18.557 --> 1:08:21.093
He isn't interested in
the scientific path.

1:08:21.127 --> 1:08:21.994
Okay.

1:08:24.897 --> 1:08:26.598
Okay.

1:08:26.631 --> 1:08:28.768
It's bonded with the
flesh, that's very unusual.

1:08:28.801 --> 1:08:30.435
Oh God!

1:08:31.838 --> 1:08:34.841
Yes, but he isn't here, is he?

1:08:34.874 --> 1:08:36.575
What's unusual?

1:08:36.608 --> 1:08:38.778
Well, that the infection
will take hold so quickly.

1:08:39.879 --> 1:08:41.713
You have very special
flesh, Martin.

1:08:41.747 --> 1:08:42.581
Thanks.

1:09:16.148 --> 1:09:20.152
So, you're using light
and sound to communicate?

1:09:23.488 --> 1:09:24.824
Yes.

1:09:24.857 --> 1:09:26.658
The light pulse is in
reaction to the feedback

1:09:26.691 --> 1:09:28.526
that the microphones
give me from the trees.

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:29.594
What feedback?

1:09:29.628 --> 1:09:31.097
Well, plants can make noise.

1:09:31.130 --> 1:09:33.132
The trees can actually
control some of the sounds

1:09:33.165 --> 1:09:35.001
that the branches make.

1:09:35.034 --> 1:09:37.636
Even the roots make sounds
at a certain frequency.

1:09:39.005 --> 1:09:43.042
Now, once you filter out the
wind on the woodland noise,

1:09:43.075 --> 1:09:44.877
there is a definite pattern.

1:09:44.911 --> 1:09:47.712
Through these reactions, I've
created a very basic language.

1:09:52.617 --> 1:09:54.186
We tried to make contact
with the mycorrhiza

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:57.156
in a more direct way, using
the rites in the book.

1:09:57.189 --> 1:09:59.091
We pushed it too far.

1:09:59.125 --> 1:10:00.659
Zach, he was never the same.

1:10:02.828 --> 1:10:04.196
Whatever Zach saw terrified him.

1:10:04.230 --> 1:10:05.798
He ran, I didn't
see him for months

1:10:05.831 --> 1:10:08.034
until I found him living
in the opposite Valley.

1:10:08.067 --> 1:10:10.635
He barely recognized
me. He was wild.

1:10:10.669 --> 1:10:12.671
Why did he use the
ritual in the book?

1:10:13.605 --> 1:10:15.174
It seems like a contradiction.

1:10:15.207 --> 1:10:17.676
I was just reacting
to the results.

1:10:17.709 --> 1:10:20.545
Using the book seem to
accelerate the progress.

1:10:20.578 --> 1:10:22.447
I had to learn to
have an open mind.

1:10:23.249 --> 1:10:24.616
I'm surprised you don't.

1:10:32.992 --> 1:10:33.960
Listen.

1:10:47.139 --> 1:10:49.607
It all emanates from
the surrounding stone.

1:10:49.641 --> 1:10:52.745
This is where there is the
densest cluster of mycorrhiza.

1:10:52.778 --> 1:10:55.147
Now it regulates this forest
for about 30 square miles,

1:10:55.181 --> 1:10:56.882
but I think it could
be bigger still.

1:10:56.916 --> 1:10:57.750
How big?

1:10:57.783 --> 1:10:59.151
Countrywide.

1:10:59.185 --> 1:11:00.186
Really?

1:11:00.219 --> 1:11:01.754
Nature is one giant system.

1:11:01.787 --> 1:11:04.991
This, this is the key
to communicate with it.

1:11:06.624 --> 1:11:07.994
I'm so close to a
real breakthrough.

1:11:08.027 --> 1:11:09.996
It makes sense that you
were here to witness it.

1:11:10.029 --> 1:11:11.897
But we're not
gonna wait for that.

1:11:13.232 --> 1:11:15.935
As soon as Martin's strong
enough, we're gonna go.

1:11:15.968 --> 1:11:18.871
You still want to leave after
I've shown you all of this?

1:11:20.072 --> 1:11:21.907
We don't have a choice.

1:11:21.941 --> 1:11:23.608
It's only a matter of time
before Zach comes here

1:11:23.641 --> 1:11:24.509
looking for us.

1:11:25.277 --> 1:11:26.511
We have to go.

1:11:29.915 --> 1:11:31.183
This is a mistake.

1:11:32.985 --> 1:11:33.853
Talk to her.

1:11:35.154 --> 1:11:38.924
But, I mean, she
has a point, Olivia.

1:11:42.895 --> 1:11:45.097
I don't trust her, Martin.

1:11:45.131 --> 1:11:45.965
Why not?

1:11:47.333 --> 1:11:51.103
She said she's been
imprisoned here.

1:11:51.137 --> 1:11:52.570
And what?

1:11:52.604 --> 1:11:54.206
He never came here
in all that time?

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:55.607
She's just over that hill.

1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:56.842
Wouldn't it make more sense if

1:11:56.876 --> 1:11:58.811
they were still
working together?

1:11:58.844 --> 1:11:59.677
On what?

1:12:00.813 --> 1:12:01.747
I don't know.

1:12:05.951 --> 1:12:08.054
Did she tell you
that she was married?

1:12:08.087 --> 1:12:08.921
No.

1:12:10.622 --> 1:12:12.358
Well, she must have said
something about herself.

1:12:12.391 --> 1:12:14.293
When? When would she say that?

1:12:14.326 --> 1:12:16.962
When you were
in a relationship.

1:12:16.996 --> 1:12:20.933
I don't want to talk
about that, it's private.

1:12:22.168 --> 1:12:23.135
Right.

1:12:23.169 --> 1:12:24.870
Private maybe, but I mean,

1:12:24.904 --> 1:12:26.305
under the circumstances can
you see that it's relevant?

1:12:26.338 --> 1:12:27.740
Yeah.

1:12:27.773 --> 1:12:29.942
What
happened between them?

1:12:29.975 --> 1:12:31.143
I don't know.

1:12:31.177 --> 1:12:32.677
She didn't talk
about other people.

1:12:32.710 --> 1:12:33.711
It's the first I heard
about her husband.

1:12:33.746 --> 1:12:35.848
Okay, Martin, I don't care.

1:12:35.881 --> 1:12:36.849
We need to go.

1:12:39.018 --> 1:12:40.685
She's not gonna
leave this place.

1:12:42.121 --> 1:12:45.224
The whole reason why you came
here was to see her, right?

1:12:46.425 --> 1:12:47.692
I thought it was.

1:12:49.261 --> 1:12:51.596
So then, so if
you care about her

1:12:52.731 --> 1:12:54.233
then you need to
get her to leave.

1:13:00.806 --> 1:13:03.776
Olivia, I think Alma
has a very good point.

1:13:07.913 --> 1:13:09.381
You can't convince
me to leave Martin.

1:13:09.415 --> 1:13:11.851
And it really is
too late now anyway.

1:13:13.419 --> 1:13:14.954
What do you mean too late?

1:13:16.455 --> 1:13:19.758
It was like I
didn't have a choice.

1:13:22.761 --> 1:13:25.764
It's so strange that the stone
doesn't appear on any maps.

1:13:26.932 --> 1:13:28.934
The only mention of
it is in that book.

1:13:32.338 --> 1:13:34.140
How did you volunteer
to come here?

1:13:37.810 --> 1:13:39.111
Actually...

1:13:44.250 --> 1:13:45.751
I came
here to see you.

1:13:46.952 --> 1:13:49.755
All through lockdown I
thought a lot about us.

1:13:49.788 --> 1:13:51.257
I know that's weird, but-

1:13:51.290 --> 1:13:54.827
- The thought, did it grow
inside you like a seed?

1:13:55.995 --> 1:13:57.997
A voice in your head
that you couldn't deny?

1:14:02.368 --> 1:14:03.402
Maybe.

1:14:03.435 --> 1:14:05.738
Martin, I lied to you before.

1:14:06.939 --> 1:14:09.775
I did get Zach involved,
but I didn't call him.

1:14:09.808 --> 1:14:11.143
He just turned up.

1:14:11.177 --> 1:14:12.311
He said exactly the same thing

1:14:12.344 --> 1:14:14.679
that he couldn't deny the urge.

1:14:16.282 --> 1:14:20.286
I found him here by the stone,
the same way I found you

1:14:20.319 --> 1:14:22.054
and you found out Alma.

1:14:22.087 --> 1:14:23.455
No, no, no, I wanted to come.

1:14:23.489 --> 1:14:26.825
Martin, the
mycorrhizal network,

1:14:26.859 --> 1:14:29.929
it draws resources to the
forest from many miles,

1:14:29.962 --> 1:14:31.964
and maybe it brought you too.

1:14:31.997 --> 1:14:33.399
Okay, let's say that's true.

1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:35.868
How could that be possible?

1:14:36.869 --> 1:14:38.037
Did you have ringworm?

1:14:43.842 --> 1:14:45.010
Yeah.

1:14:45.044 --> 1:14:46.212
Zach and I did too.

1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:49.281
I wondered what it was
doing to our bodies.

1:14:49.315 --> 1:14:52.451
Was it pushing our body
chemistry in certain directions?

1:14:52.484 --> 1:14:54.853
Obsession, love?

1:14:57.990 --> 1:14:59.391
This is too important, Martin.

1:15:00.426 --> 1:15:01.894
Think about why we're here.

1:15:04.330 --> 1:15:06.065
This isn't chance.

1:15:06.966 --> 1:15:08.367
It isn't.

1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:10.736
And you can't fight it.

1:16:01.453 --> 1:16:03.455
Martin, Martin.

1:16:04.123 --> 1:16:05.391
Martin, wake up.

1:16:06.458 --> 1:16:07.493
Who is it?

1:16:07.526 --> 1:16:08.527
Dr. Wendle, she's gone.

1:16:10.195 --> 1:16:11.297
I can't find her.

1:16:11.330 --> 1:16:12.564
You sure?

1:16:12.598 --> 1:16:13.832
Yes. I'm sure.

1:16:13.866 --> 1:16:15.000
What time is it?

1:16:16.468 --> 1:16:18.203
How long has it been light?

1:16:18.237 --> 1:16:20.539
About half an hour.

1:17:06.385 --> 1:17:08.253
Agh!

1:17:48.694 --> 1:17:49.962
How are you feeling?

1:17:51.096 --> 1:17:52.331
What are the symptoms?

1:17:54.299 --> 1:17:56.602
Anxiety? Blurred vision?

1:17:58.270 --> 1:17:59.471
Yeah.

1:17:59.505 --> 1:18:01.673
Extra acoustic
and visual stimuli?

1:18:01.707 --> 1:18:03.409
Where did you go?

1:18:03.442 --> 1:18:04.710
I was checking the readings

1:18:04.744 --> 1:18:07.279
from the monitoring
devices in the woods.

1:18:07.312 --> 1:18:10.282
When I came back,
you were both gone.

1:18:19.191 --> 1:18:21.293
Everything seems
to just keep us here.

1:18:22.461 --> 1:18:24.329
The mist
encircles the camp.

1:18:26.265 --> 1:18:30.302
Ranging from 400 meters to
100 meters from the center.

1:18:30.335 --> 1:18:32.070
What is it?

1:18:32.104 --> 1:18:33.705
It's a suspension of mushroom
spores and water droplets

1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:34.673
in the air.

1:18:40.212 --> 1:18:42.749
Forest is acting to contain us.

1:18:42.782 --> 1:18:44.016
What?

1:18:44.049 --> 1:18:45.083
I've seen it before with Zach,

1:18:45.117 --> 1:18:46.418
it forced him from the Valley.

1:18:46.452 --> 1:18:48.153
Why didn't you
tell us about that?

1:18:48.187 --> 1:18:49.154
Sorry, didn't I say?

1:18:49.188 --> 1:18:50.722
No, you didn't.

1:18:50.757 --> 1:18:53.459
It was quite a lot of
information to keep track of.

1:18:54.794 --> 1:18:56.428
Well, why don't we
use your hazmat suit

1:18:56.462 --> 1:18:58.096
and walk through it?

1:18:58.130 --> 1:19:00.065
And what if the mist
is less than 0.3 microns?

1:19:00.098 --> 1:19:01.467
It will go through the filter.

1:19:02.634 --> 1:19:04.136
It's gotta be worth a try.

1:19:06.271 --> 1:19:07.740
We can wait it out.

1:19:07.774 --> 1:19:10.275
When it happened before it
only lasted a day or so.

1:19:23.455 --> 1:19:24.656
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:19:24.690 --> 1:19:26.692
Come here. Come here.

1:19:28.460 --> 1:19:29.796
You see that?

1:19:29.829 --> 1:19:31.029
What?

1:19:31.063 --> 1:19:31.731
The person who stood there.

1:19:31.764 --> 1:19:32.598
See the three trees?

1:19:32.631 --> 1:19:33.532
Middle tree, look.

1:19:35.567 --> 1:19:37.436
Wait, Alma.

1:19:58.323 --> 1:19:59.725
What does that mean?

1:20:04.429 --> 1:20:06.298
It means Zach can
come at anytime.

1:20:39.331 --> 1:20:40.132
Excuse me.

1:20:56.214 --> 1:20:59.217
If you pass out, I'll
pull you back, okay?

1:21:00.352 --> 1:21:01.219
Yeah.

1:21:04.256 --> 1:21:07.726
Get through the mist,
head straight to the camp.

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:09.528
I'll be there and
back in a few days.

1:21:09.561 --> 1:21:10.863
How's that?

1:21:10.897 --> 1:21:12.497
Yeah, it's fine.

1:21:25.510 --> 1:21:26.913
Okay, ready?

1:22:50.429 --> 1:22:52.230
Alma, you okay?

1:22:56.334 --> 1:22:58.336
Alma, are you okay?

1:23:38.376 --> 1:23:39.344
Alma?

1:23:39.377 --> 1:23:41.513
What do you see?

1:23:42.982 --> 1:23:47.987
I see
things

1:23:50.655 --> 1:23:52.324
All right,
Alma come back.

1:23:52.357 --> 1:23:54.493
I'm pulling you back.

1:24:06.939 --> 1:24:08.875
I'm pulling you back in.

1:24:18.918 --> 1:24:19.886
For god's sake,

1:24:19.919 --> 1:24:20.953
- pull her back in
- I am.

1:24:38.971 --> 1:24:39.806
Are you okay?

1:24:45.710 --> 1:24:47.046
Have some water.

1:24:47.079 --> 1:24:50.817
Oh my God!

1:24:52.018 --> 1:24:55.021
It's okay, you're
out of it now.

1:24:55.054 --> 1:24:56.923
You're out of it now.

1:24:57.857 --> 1:24:59.025
It's okay. It's okay.

1:24:59.058 --> 1:25:01.726
It's okay. You're out of it now.

1:25:05.731 --> 1:25:07.432
What did you see?

1:25:07.465 --> 1:25:09.501
It was everything.

1:25:09.534 --> 1:25:10.468
Everything.

1:25:12.805 --> 1:25:14.372
She's delirious.

1:25:14.406 --> 1:25:15.373
I told you this wouldn't work.

1:25:15.407 --> 1:25:17.709
Yes. Yes, I know, I know.

1:25:17.743 --> 1:25:20.746
You're out of it now. Come on.

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:23.049
It's not
what you think.

1:25:23.082 --> 1:25:24.750
I know, I know let's go now.

1:25:24.784 --> 1:25:26.451
You're outside of
it, so it's fine.

1:25:26.484 --> 1:25:27.820
Let's go back to the camp.

1:25:27.854 --> 1:25:29.721
It's fine now. You're safe now.

1:25:29.755 --> 1:25:31.623
Let's go back to the camp, okay?

1:25:32.624 --> 1:25:33.491
It's only-

1:25:33.525 --> 1:25:34.760
- I know. I know.

1:25:36.095 --> 1:25:37.529
Yes I know. Let's
go back to the camp.

1:25:37.562 --> 1:25:39.431
It looks like a
human, but it's not.

1:25:39.464 --> 1:25:42.601
- It is not a human.
- Yeah, okay. Come on.

1:25:43.803 --> 1:25:45.805
You can tell me
back at the camp.

1:25:45.838 --> 1:25:46.705
Come on.

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:02.054
How far has it moved?

1:26:06.458 --> 1:26:09.028
I don't know,
10 meters, maybe?

1:26:09.061 --> 1:26:11.898
I mean, at this rate it will
cover the camp by morning.

1:26:30.216 --> 1:26:31.784
What do you want?

1:26:33.052 --> 1:26:34.387
I need to talk to him.

1:26:35.955 --> 1:26:37.656
This is important.

1:26:37.689 --> 1:26:39.691
I've never seen him come this
close to the camp before.

1:26:39.724 --> 1:26:41.093
Is that a good idea?

1:26:41.127 --> 1:26:43.495
Martin, he won't hurt
me. I know he won't.

1:26:56.541 --> 1:26:57.843
We can't trust him.

1:26:57.877 --> 1:26:59.211
I don't know
what choice we have.

1:27:10.588 --> 1:27:12.224
What are they talking about?

1:27:12.258 --> 1:27:14.760
I don't know, I can't hear.

1:27:32.544 --> 1:27:34.113
He said he wants to talk.

1:28:16.122 --> 1:28:18.523
One of us needs to go
to the standing stone.

1:28:19.925 --> 1:28:22.560
It is where the light and
sound activity will be focused.

1:28:23.728 --> 1:28:25.630
Then they have to
take the sacrament.

1:28:26.698 --> 1:28:27.867
What sacrament?

1:28:28.901 --> 1:28:30.602
This.

1:28:30.635 --> 1:28:32.138
I thought you said you
were gonna use your equipment

1:28:32.171 --> 1:28:33.039
to make contact.

1:28:33.072 --> 1:28:33.939
Yes.

1:28:35.307 --> 1:28:37.675
So then why are
you referring to this?

1:28:39.378 --> 1:28:41.713
The book is
the most direct route.

1:28:42.882 --> 1:28:43.916
And then what?

1:28:43.949 --> 1:28:46.018
It's just going to release us?

1:28:47.153 --> 1:28:48.988
That's what Zach said.

1:28:49.021 --> 1:28:51.791
I can't believe we're performing
a ritual to be honest.

1:28:51.824 --> 1:28:54.726
Martin, I know this
makes you uncomfortable,

1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:56.128
it makes me uncomfortable too.

1:28:56.162 --> 1:28:59.098
But if it wants to talk,
then we have to listen.

1:28:59.131 --> 1:29:01.200
I don't think
you are listening.

1:29:01.233 --> 1:29:02.700
I don't think you've
been listening.

1:29:02.735 --> 1:29:05.603
What do you think it
wants to tell you?

1:29:07.039 --> 1:29:10.076
Well, Alma, I would think
that was clear by now, no?

1:29:11.377 --> 1:29:12.644
No, not really, no.

1:29:13.678 --> 1:29:14.712
How we can all live together

1:29:14.747 --> 1:29:16.714
without destroying each other.

1:29:16.749 --> 1:29:18.184
This is the same as
any other creature,

1:29:18.217 --> 1:29:20.953
he's worried about its
environment, food, shelter.

1:29:20.986 --> 1:29:24.356
You keep talking about
this thing as if it's human.

1:29:24.390 --> 1:29:27.659
You sound just like
Zach, it's not.

1:29:28.961 --> 1:29:30.996
We are at the forefront
of human discovery.

1:29:32.131 --> 1:29:33.399
Don't you think we
should endeavor to speak

1:29:33.432 --> 1:29:35.901
to this creature
regardless of the cost?

1:29:38.670 --> 1:29:40.139
All right. Okay, great.

1:29:55.421 --> 1:29:57.156
Doesn't look too bad.

1:29:57.189 --> 1:30:00.025
I mean, on a scale of one to
10, how bad does that look?

1:30:00.059 --> 1:30:01.060
I'd say a five.

1:30:01.093 --> 1:30:02.394
It looks like milk.

1:30:02.428 --> 1:30:04.130
Yeah, exactly.

1:30:04.163 --> 1:30:05.697
- Mushroom milk
- You don't have to do this.

1:30:05.731 --> 1:30:06.966
Yeah I know, I know.

1:30:06.999 --> 1:30:07.867
I know.

1:30:08.934 --> 1:30:10.136
But you saved my life already,

1:30:10.169 --> 1:30:13.205
so at least let me
repay the favor.

1:30:13.239 --> 1:30:14.840
You don't have
to repay anything.

1:30:14.874 --> 1:30:16.674
Yeah,
you drink it then.

1:30:19.445 --> 1:30:20.412
Oh!

1:30:33.159 --> 1:30:34.326
Martin?

1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:35.761
Oh,
that's disgusting.

1:30:35.794 --> 1:30:37.396
Martin,
can you hear me?

1:30:37.429 --> 1:30:38.297
Yeah.

1:30:39.865 --> 1:30:40.833
Okay, now we wait.

1:30:41.834 --> 1:30:42.667
Okay.

1:30:44.303 --> 1:30:45.271
Oh, goodness!

1:30:46.472 --> 1:30:47.373
Now we're gonna wait.

1:30:49.842 --> 1:30:50.976
Yeah, just gonna wait.

1:30:55.247 --> 1:30:56.882
What can you see out there?

1:30:58.217 --> 1:30:59.051
Huh?

1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:01.787
What did she say?

1:31:03.055 --> 1:31:04.390
What can you see?

1:31:04.423 --> 1:31:07.760
Oh, nothing really.

1:31:09.161 --> 1:31:12.231
I can see the shapes of
the trees from the strobes.

1:31:17.236 --> 1:31:18.971
Just keep focusing
on my voice.

1:31:20.372 --> 1:31:22.007
How are you feeling?

1:31:23.008 --> 1:31:24.109
Feeling okay.

1:31:27.046 --> 1:31:28.713
Just thinking about my parents.

1:31:40.125 --> 1:31:42.394
Oh my God, it's too loud.

1:31:42.428 --> 1:31:44.363
Oh, God!

1:31:44.396 --> 1:31:45.264
Sorry.

1:31:46.799 --> 1:31:48.801
Something's tripped
the electrical system.

1:31:48.834 --> 1:31:50.202
Ah, where?

1:31:51.971 --> 1:31:54.473
It's lamp 15. Can you check
it out for me please, Alma?

1:31:57.543 --> 1:31:59.378
Okay, I'm restarting
the system now.

1:32:07.386 --> 1:32:09.321
Can you hear me?

1:32:20.299 --> 1:32:22.534
It looks like somebody
is knocked it over.

1:32:22.568 --> 1:32:23.502
Alma?

1:32:39.852 --> 1:32:40.853
Remember me?

1:32:58.937 --> 1:32:59.905
Come on Martin.

1:33:36.575 --> 1:33:39.244
She didn't tell you about
the whole ritual, did she?

1:33:42.214 --> 1:33:44.883
Mycorrhiza always asks
a price of its host.

1:33:46.485 --> 1:33:49.121
Your death will allow
me to speak with it.

1:33:49.154 --> 1:33:51.357
Please Zach, please Zach.

1:34:03.035 --> 1:34:05.571
I wish it could be me, Martin.

1:34:07.072 --> 1:34:10.342
I would have given anything
to have been the one.

1:34:10.376 --> 1:34:12.544
Please Zach. Please Zach.

1:34:14.313 --> 1:34:15.314
Please Zach.

1:34:18.150 --> 1:34:19.151
Please Zach.

1:34:20.986 --> 1:34:22.421
Wouldn't take me.

1:34:28.961 --> 1:34:33.966
It called me, but
wouldn't take me.

1:34:56.188 --> 1:34:58.991
I told you not
to come in here.

1:36:25.277 --> 1:36:28.280
What have you,
what have you done?

1:36:32.217 --> 1:36:35.654
That's how accidents happen?

1:36:38.423 --> 1:36:40.158
Oh.

1:36:44.831 --> 1:36:48.400
I need, okay.

1:36:48.433 --> 1:36:49.434
I think I had.

1:36:53.305 --> 1:36:54.741
No, no.

1:36:55.842 --> 1:36:58.745
You have to take
me to the hospital.

1:37:11.858 --> 1:37:15.260
I wasn't surprised
you were seeing him.

1:37:15.294 --> 1:37:17.229
Oh my God!

1:37:48.460 --> 1:37:53.465
You, you're so
open, so trusting.

1:38:03.910 --> 1:38:07.279
You are

1:38:07.312 --> 1:38:11.249
This is the most important
moment of your life.

1:41:45.798 --> 1:41:46.631
Thank you.

1:42:32.178 --> 1:42:35.380
Let me guide you
out of the woods.
