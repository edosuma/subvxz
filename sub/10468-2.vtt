WHEN, JUST
YESTERDAY,

09:10.724 --> 09:12.421
WE SAID THAT
RESULT-ORIENTED THINKING

09:12.421 --> 09:14.554
IS BAD FOR
THE CREATIVE PROCESS.

WELL, UH,

09:17.034 --> 09:19.384
JULIA,
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY A WORD

09:19.384 --> 09:20.734
ABOUT HOW
YOUR PROCESS

09:20.734 --> 09:22.562
IS BEING AFFECTED
BY A CONTRACT

09:22.562 --> 09:25.956
AND A LOOMING

09:25.956 --> 09:30.308
LOOMING. UH,
RIGHT, IT IS.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.659
OK, WELL,
I'M JUST GLAD TO BE
AT THIS SCHOOL

09:32.659 --> 09:34.356
SO I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE PRESSURE ALONE.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.967
PRESSURE?
[LAUGHING]

09:36.967 --> 09:39.840
I'M SORRY, UH,
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO COMMENT SERIOUSLY

09:39.840 --> 09:41.058
ON A COMMERCIAL
TELL-ALL

09:41.058 --> 09:42.973
BY AN AUTHOR
WHO'S OBVIOUSLY

09:42.973 --> 09:45.628
SOMEONE'S CYNICAL IDEA
FOR A HOT JACKET COVER?

09:45.628 --> 09:46.673
Instructor:
ANDERS?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.152
WHAT?

09:48.152 --> 09:49.458
THAT'S A LITTLE
BIT HOSTILE.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.981
EVEN FOR YOU.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.331
SORRY.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.333
Instructor:
OK, LISTEN,
PEOPLE,

09:55.333 --> 09:57.509
BELIEVE ME,

09:57.509 --> 09:59.250
WE ALL DON'T HAVE
TO FEEL THREATENED

09:59.250 --> 10:01.775
BECAUSE JULIA'S
GOT A BOOK DEAL.

10:01.775 --> 10:06.344

9 TIMES OUT OF 10?

10:13.743 --> 10:15.136
THEY BACK OUT.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.486
THEY SAY,
"OH, WE'RE SORRY,

10:17.486 --> 10:22.143
BUT IT'S TOO MINOR
FOR PUBLICATION."

10:23.710 --> 10:25.407
SO...

10:25.407 --> 10:28.845
LET'S ALL TRY
TO BE ADULTS
HERE, SHALL WE?

10:28.845 --> 10:32.066

OF CONDITIONS IS APPLIED

10:45.688 --> 10:47.908
...THE EQUILIBRIUM
POSITION WILL SHIFT

10:47.908 --> 10:49.431
TO REDUCE THE STRESS

10:49.431 --> 10:51.868
AND A NEW EQUILIBRIUM
POSITION WILL BE REACHED--

10:51.868 --> 10:54.479
WHAT IS THAT?

10:54.479 --> 10:56.525
Cody on P.A.:
HEY, UH, THIS
IS FOR CLAUDIA.

LISTEN.

[APPLAUDING]

AND BUTTONS AND SNAPS
ON THIS THING--

12:04.201 --> 12:05.550
CAN YOU--
YOU KNOW WHAT,

12:05.550 --> 12:06.900
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

12:06.900 --> 12:10.294
CAN YOU--WHAT?
CAN YOU WHAT?

12:10.294 --> 12:14.603
I JUST--IT'S ABOUT
WHAT WE SAID BEFORE,
AT A.A. TODAY.

12:17.084 --> 12:23.612
SARAH, CAN'T THIS
WAIT TILL LATER.
LIKE...AFTER?

12:23.612 --> 12:25.396
WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT US
AT MEETINGS,

12:25.396 --> 12:28.008
DO YOU TELL PEOPLE
THAT THINGS ARE GOOD?

12:28.008 --> 12:30.662
WHAT? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

12:30.662 --> 12:33.448
WELL, BECAUSE
RIGHT NOW THINGS
SEEM GREAT.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.712
YOU KNOW, REALLY,
INCREDIBLY GREAT.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.670
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

12:38.670 --> 12:42.674
BUT SOMETIMES
I WORRY,

12:42.674 --> 12:44.415
HOW IT ALL
HAPPENED,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.374
IF IT
WAS TOO EASY.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.724
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I SAID I WAS MAD,

12:48.724 --> 12:49.856
AND YOU SAID
YOU WERE SORRY,

12:49.856 --> 12:51.118
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

12:51.118 --> 12:52.902
WE
HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED THAT MUCH.

12:52.902 --> 12:58.386
YOU KNOW, WE'VE JUST
SORTA DONE THIS.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.562
AND DONE IT,
AND DONE IT.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.999
AND I AM NOT
COMPLAINING,
TRUST ME.

13:02.999 --> 13:06.655
IT'S JUST THAT
SOMETIMES I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.833

RIGHT.

ABOUT NOW?

13:17.231 --> 13:19.233
WELL, EXCEPT
FOR NOW.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.278
I CAN GIVE YOU
ANY TIME BUT NOW.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.889
OK, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH NOW?

13:22.889 --> 13:25.979
NOW IS BUSY.
NOW IS BAD.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.942
ARE YOU SURE LATER
WOULDN'T WORK?

13:32.942 --> 13:37.773
OK, LATER IS GOOD.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.863
BUT WE'LL DO IT, OK?
I PROMISE.

13:40.863 --> 13:44.171
YEAH, OK.
SOUNDS GREAT.

13:44.171 --> 13:47.217
I WAS JUST...

13:47.217 --> 13:48.479

OF NERVOUS,

13:48.479 --> 13:50.307
AND STIFF.

KIND OF HURTS.

DIDN'T HELP.

GETTING BUNCHED UP
UNDER THE SHEET.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.631
YEAH, BUT STILL,
I MEAN,

14:09.631 --> 14:11.894
I WASN'T EXACTLY
THE LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER

14:11.894 --> 14:14.157
THAT I'VE BEEN
KNOWN TO BE.

14:14.157 --> 14:17.291

SINCE BEFORE
THE WEDDING,

14:17.291 --> 14:20.816

ANYWAY, AT THIS
POINT, REALLY,

14:23.558 --> 14:26.213

THE DIFFERENCE?

14:38.660 --> 14:40.009

14:40.009 --> 14:41.532
BECAUSE IT'S GOT
TO HAPPEN SOMETIME.

EACH OTHER THIS WELL.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.277

THE SOUND OF THIS.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.931

16:05.921 --> 16:07.618
BUT IT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.839

I GUESSED THAT,
ALEXA.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.711

TO ASK ME ABOUT THE SONG.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.712

TO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.029
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT IT.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.726
OK?

16:31.338 --> 16:33.514
OK.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.603
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

16:37.735 --> 16:41.696
BUT IF I COULD JUST
ASK ONE QUESTION?

16:41.696 --> 16:44.655
HE CHEATED ON YOU,
AM I RIGHT?

16:44.655 --> 16:45.874
LOOK, ALEXA--

16:45.874 --> 16:47.223
I KNOW, BUTT OUT,
ALREADY--

16:47.223 --> 16:50.879
BUT WHY ELSE WOULD
A GUY LIKE HIM

16:50.879 --> 16:52.402
DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

16:52.402 --> 16:54.926
AND WHY ELSE WOULD
A GIRL LIKE YOU

16:54.926 --> 16:58.234
WANT TO KEEP IT
A SECRET?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.804
I'M SORRY.
FORGET IT.

17:02.804 --> 17:03.935
I'LL LEAVE YOU
ALONE.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.807
HE CHEATED ON ME.

17:08.288 --> 17:11.856
YOU GUESSED RIGHT,
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.213
NOW, WE ARE ENTITLED
TO ALL OF THE EDITIONS DONE,

17:20.213 --> 17:22.215

THAT THEY ARE CLEAR
ON THAT, PLEASE.

LYNN, CAN YOU TAKE JULIA THROUGH
THE LEGALESE OF HER
CONTRACT, PLEASE?

17:29.613 --> 17:31.528

ARE MORE ABOUT WRITING.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.313
SEE, I HAVE
THESE ANECDOTES

17:33.313 --> 17:34.705
ABOUT MY BROTHERS

TO PLAY MAKE BELIEVE--

17:34.705 --> 17:36.011

IS THERE
ANYONE THERE
WHO CAN HELP YOU?

17:49.764 --> 17:51.679
WELL, IF
IT'S WHICH SONGS ARE GOING TO GO
ON THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.855
REALLY, I NEED
ONE OR TWO MINUTES.

17:53.855 --> 17:57.032
I CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T?

17:57.032 --> 17:59.643
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.819

I READ.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.303

REALLY THOUGHT--

18:07.303 --> 18:09.262
YOU KNOW, ASIDE FROM
THE TIME CONSTRAINTS I HAVE,

18:09.262 --> 18:12.003
WHICH ARE--I HAVE GOT
11 BOOKS IN DEVELOPMENT,

18:12.003 --> 18:14.745
NOW, I COULD NEVER SIT DOWN
WITH ALL OF THE WRITERS
AND TALK TO THEM--

18:16.834 --> 18:20.142
WELL, THERE'S ALSO--
A GUY LIKE ME,

18:20.142 --> 18:23.102
THERE'S A REASON
WHY HE EDITS
INSTEAD OF WRITES.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.974
OH, COME ON,
YOU'VE DONE SOME
FANTASTIC BOOKS.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.803

I'VE REARRANGED,
MADE NOTES.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.674

THAT I ACTUALLY WROTE...

18:30.674 --> 18:33.938
WHAT, A BOOK?
YOU--YOU WROTE
A BOOK.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.244
NO, I TYPED IT.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.159
TO CALL IT WRITING...

18:39.770 --> 18:41.729
ONE SECOND.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.992
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.

18:43.992 --> 18:48.649
I'M SORRY.
I WISH I COULD HELP.

18:50.651 --> 18:51.869
TONIGHT, HUH?

18:51.869 --> 18:53.741
JUST THE END
OF THE DINNER SHIFT,

18:53.741 --> 18:55.090
TO CLOSE UP THE PLACE.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.745
SO YOU GUYS CAN GET
A LITTLE ALONE TIME.

THE WHOLE WEEK?

19:03.664 --> 19:06.493

JUST--TONIGHT'S PLENTY.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.104
OH, YOU COULDN'T USE
A FEW EXTRA NIGHTS
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND

19:09.104 --> 19:10.845
FOR A LITTLE TALKING...
OR WHATEVER?

19:10.845 --> 19:12.499
WELL, THANKS, JOE,

19:12.499 --> 19:14.327

19:14.327 --> 19:15.893

FOR CHARLIE'S WEDDING,

19:28.384 --> 19:29.385
BUT, UM...

19:29.385 --> 19:31.082
NOW WHAT'S THE POINT?

19:31.082 --> 19:32.475
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, JOE?

19:32.475 --> 19:34.042
[SIGHS]

19:34.042 --> 19:36.349

WE'RE HAVING
OUR PROBLEMS,

19:36.349 --> 19:38.089
AND, UH...

19:38.089 --> 19:41.267
IT'S NOTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW
THE WHOLE SAGA ABOUT,

19:41.267 --> 19:44.008
BUT, UH, BASICALLY,
FOR NOW,

19:44.008 --> 19:47.490
WE'RE GONNA TRY IT
APART FOR A WHILE.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.972
WOW, JOE.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.800
SO, A COUPLE
EXTRA NIGHTS

19:52.800 --> 19:55.498
WHEN I'M NOT ALONE
IN MY HOTEL ROOM--

19:55.498 --> 19:56.717
JOE, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

19:56.717 --> 19:59.285
OK? TAKE THE REST
OF THE WEEK HERE.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.244
AND ANY OTHER TIME.
JUST COME BY.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.985
I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
AROUND HERE.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.987
I REALLY HATE
DUMPING THIS ON YOU
RIGHT NOW.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.206
JOE, FORGET IT.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.077
I MEAN, WHEN THINGS
ARE GOING

20:09.077 --> 20:11.210
SO GREAT FOR YOU
AND YOUR BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.997

30:15.248 --> 30:17.206
I BEGGED YOU
NOT TO DO THIS.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.642
LOOK, YOU'RE JUST--

30:18.642 --> 30:21.863
YOU'RE STILL MAD
AT ME, CLAUD, BUT, UM...

30:21.863 --> 30:23.560
I KNOW THAT'LL PASS.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.607
MAYBE IT WILL,
BUT THE REST
OF IT WON'T.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.174
I MEAN, DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?

30:28.174 --> 30:30.002
I HAVE TOLD YOU
THAT IT'S OVER.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.831
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
JUST GIVE UP, OK?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.441
I CAN'T DO THAT.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.138
ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU ARE.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.012
DO YOU MIND?
WE'RE HAVING
A CONVERSATION HERE.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.883
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

30:41.883 --> 30:45.626
WHERE SHE KEEPS SAYING
THE SAME THING
AND YOU DON'T LISTEN?

30:45.626 --> 30:47.149
WHO ARE YOU?
WHO IS SHE?

30:47.149 --> 30:49.760
I AM JUST AN OBSERVER
WHO CAN'T HELP SEEING

30:49.760 --> 30:51.197
THIS GIRL IS DONE WITH YOU.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.373
CLAUD, CAN WE DO THIS
SOMEWHERE ELSE, PLEASE?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.375
I WISH I WAS
HALF AS BAD AS HER,

30:55.375 --> 30:57.986
AND SHE DREW THE LINE.
SHE SAID NO,

30:57.986 --> 31:00.075
LIKE, HALF A TRILLION TIMES.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.511
LEX, YOU THINK WE COULD
JUST LEAVE THIS TO THEM?

31:01.511 --> 31:02.861
YOU SHUT UP, CAMERON.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.558
CLAUD, IS THAT
WHAT YOU THINK?

31:04.558 --> 31:07.126
I MEAN, IS THIS--
IS THIS CHEERLEADER

31:07.126 --> 31:08.736
SPEAKING FOR YOU?

31:08.736 --> 31:10.520
I GUESS SHE IS.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.523
COME ON. LOOK,
I'M JUST TRYING
TO REACH YOU HERE.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.177
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO LEAVE, CODY.

31:15.177 --> 31:18.659
HEAR ME OUT, OK?
I MEAN, FOR 15 SECONDS.
PLEASE.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.095
I SAID LEAVE.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.638
IS IT GONNA BE...

31:41.638 --> 31:42.988
SAMANTHA?

31:42.988 --> 31:44.337
NO.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.468
IS IT GONNA BE--AHH--

31:45.468 --> 31:46.948
DIANA?

31:46.948 --> 31:48.863
NO.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.778
IS IT GONNA BE...

31:50.778 --> 31:52.214
UM...

31:52.214 --> 31:54.042
MR. BURBECK?

31:54.042 --> 31:55.043
HA...

31:55.043 --> 31:56.349
KIDS,

31:56.349 --> 31:57.698
MR. BURBECK,
MY BOSS,

31:57.698 --> 31:58.917
SAYS BEEP

31:58.917 --> 31:59.918
TO THE MONKEYMOBILE.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.528
MISS JABLONSKI.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.921
I-I'M SORRY.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.661
I WAS JUST--
I WAS JUST TAKING

32:04.661 --> 32:05.967
A TINY LITTLE BREAK.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.882
UH, ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT THAT TINY,

32:07.882 --> 32:09.405
BUT--YOU KNOW,
YESTERDAY,

32:09.405 --> 32:11.103
I JUST MISSED
THE WHOLE DAY
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.800
ACTUALLY, HAVE YOU MET
MY DARLING LITTLE GIRL?

32:12.800 --> 32:13.801
DAPHNE.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.498
IT'S JUST--

32:15.498 --> 32:17.761
IT'S HARD KNOWING
THAT SHE'S DOWN HERE
ALL DAY.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.938
BUT YOU KNOW.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
'CAUSE YOU HAVE KIDS.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.897
I MEAN, DON'T YOU
WANT TO SPEND EVERY
SINGLE MINUTE WITH THEM?

32:22.897 --> 32:23.985
ISN'T IT
ALMOST ENOUGH

32:23.985 --> 32:26.074
TO MAKE YOU
NOT WANT TO WORK?

32:26.074 --> 32:28.163
WELL, NOW THAT YOU
BRING IT UP...

32:28.163 --> 32:31.123
W-WAIT. WH...

32:31.123 --> 32:32.994
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I--

32:32.994 --> 32:34.517
LOOK, I'M AWFULLY SORRY,
DAPHNE.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.389
BUT--BUT,
MR. BURBECK,
THIS ISN'T--

32:36.389 --> 32:39.958
FEEL FREE TO STAY DOWN HERE
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.580
HEY. HOW'S IT GOING?

32:55.016 --> 32:58.324
JUST LIKE
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,HUH?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.500
THE LIFE OF A WRITER.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.068
YOUR MUSE
HAS ABANDONED YOU.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.460
YOU'RE BLOCKED.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.201
QUILL PEN'S BROKEN.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.032
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO CRY.

33:11.032 --> 33:14.731
NOT ABOUT TO.
ALREADY HAVE BEEN.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.124
OH, JULIA.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.431
WHAT'S WRONG?

33:18.431 --> 33:20.085
I'M JUST--
I'M, UM...

33:20.085 --> 33:21.216
STUCK.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.175
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.133
BUT, WAIT.
ISN'T IT JUST...

33:25.133 --> 33:27.135
I MEAN,
IT'S A MEMOIR, RIGHT?

33:27.135 --> 33:29.572
DOESN'T THAT MEAN
YOU JUST WRITE
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:29.572 --> 33:32.401
BUT IT'S--IT'S NOT
JUST WHAT HAPPENED.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.229
IT'S WHAT IT ALL MEANS.

33:34.229 --> 33:37.319
IT'S WHAT DID I LEARN
FROM ALL OF THIS?

33:37.319 --> 33:39.321
OK.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.019
SO WHAT DID YOU?

33:41.019 --> 33:44.065
WELL, I KNOW
ALL THE OBVIOUS THINGS.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.240
THAT STUFF I KNOW.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.633
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

33:46.633 --> 33:49.070
IF THIS BOOK
IS EVEN WORTH WRITING,

33:49.070 --> 33:50.985
I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO SAY SOMETHING NEW.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.639
WHAT DID YOUR EDITOR SAY?

33:52.639 --> 33:54.162
HE SAYS FIGURE IT OUT.

33:54.162 --> 33:56.382
HE SAYS,
"YOU'RE THE WRITER."

33:56.382 --> 33:58.949
THAT'S--
THAT'S PRETTY SUCKY.

33:58.949 --> 34:01.778
HE'S RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T NEED
ANYONE'S HELP.

34:01.778 --> 34:04.433
IF I'M REALLY
A WRITER,

34:04.433 --> 34:06.435
I SHOULD HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.611
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT MAKES A WRITER.

34:08.611 --> 34:12.441
WAIT A SEC.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.878
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT
A REAL WRITER

34:14.878 --> 34:16.532
IF YOU NEED HELP.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.969
BASICALLY.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.885
THAT'S THE BIG LESSON
YOU GOT?

34:21.885 --> 34:23.452
ALL OF THIS WITH NED?

34:23.452 --> 34:25.628
THAT YOU'RE NOT
WHO YOU SHOULD BE

34:25.628 --> 34:26.890
UNTIL--UNTIL WHAT?

34:26.890 --> 34:30.198
TILL YOU DON'T NEED
ANYONE ELSE?

34:30.198 --> 34:33.158
THAT'S-- HAT'S REALLY SAD.

34:33.158 --> 34:36.291
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
DON'T EVEN TRY.

34:36.291 --> 34:40.034
THAT...YOU'RE BETTER OFF
BEING ALONE.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.563
JUST A SEC.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.349
WE USED TO KEEP THE BITTERS
RIGHT DOWN HERE, BUT...

34:50.349 --> 34:52.351
LOOK BEHIND YOU,
UP TOP.

34:52.351 --> 34:53.613
OH, THANKS. HEY.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.005
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:55.005 --> 34:56.137
NOTHING.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.008
JUST LOOKING OVER
SOME RECEIPTS.

34:58.008 --> 35:00.620
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
YOUR NIGHT WITH SARAH.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.535
THAT WAS LAST NIGHT.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.102
LAST NIGHT, TONIGHT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING A WEEK.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.191
IT'S OK, JOE.
I GOT THIS WORK TO DO.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.279
WHAT WORK?
DON'T YOU TRUST ME HERE?

35:07.279 --> 35:08.932
JOE, I TRUST YOU.
I TRUST YOU.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.021
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING COMING
IN HERE AT 9:00 AT NIGHT?

35:11.021 --> 35:13.023
LOOK, LOOK,
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.677
PLEASE, WILL YOU?

35:17.245 --> 35:19.029
JOE, I'M SORRY.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.640
IT'S JUST...

35:22.598 --> 35:25.210
THINGS ARE NOT QUITE
AS SMOOTH AS THEY LOOK

35:25.210 --> 35:26.602
BETWEEN ME AND SARAH.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.430
THEY'RE NOT?

35:28.430 --> 35:30.084
NO. THEY'RE NOT.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.955
THERE'S--THERE'S...

35:31.955 --> 35:33.914
STUFF IN THE AIR
BETWEEN US,

35:33.914 --> 35:36.830
AND I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER
NOT TO BE WITH HER.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.658
OK, SO, UH,
THIS PROBLEM,

35:38.658 --> 35:41.965
YOU'RE SOLVING THIS
BY COMING IN HERE
AND TALKING TO ME.

35:41.965 --> 35:44.838
IT'S NOT A THING
THAT I CAN HELP
BY TALKING.

35:44.838 --> 35:46.448
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN'T HELP BY TALKING

35:46.448 --> 35:47.884
AND NOTHING YOU CAN'T
MAKE WORSE BY CLAMMING UP.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.277
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE SITUATION.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.192
I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW
THE SITUATION, BAILEY.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.193
LOOK...

35:52.193 --> 35:54.152
I'M TRAPPED, OK?

35:54.152 --> 35:58.330
BECAUSE IF I
LET HER KNOW

35:58.330 --> 35:59.940
HOW BAD
I'M STILL FEELING,

35:59.940 --> 36:02.116
THEN SHE'S GONNA
START TO FEEL BAD, TOO,

36:02.116 --> 36:04.336
AND SHE'LL RESENT ME
FOR MAKING HER
FEEL THAT WAY,

36:04.336 --> 36:05.728
AND SHE'LL BE RIGHT.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.730
BECAUSE SHE'S ALLOWED
NOT TO KNOW

36:07.730 --> 36:09.384
WHAT SHE WANTS
FOR US, JOE.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.430
AND AREN'T YOU ALLOWED
NOT TO LIKE THAT?

36:11.430 --> 36:12.822
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.607
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.348
JOE, WE'RE OK NOW.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.393
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
KNOW HOW I FEEL.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.352
BUT AS SOON AS SHE DOES,
AS SOON AS SHE KNOWS
HOW I FEEL,

36:20.352 --> 36:23.790
THEN WE'RE RIGHT BACK
TO WHERE WE WERE
FOR THE PAST 4 MONTHS,

36:23.790 --> 36:25.661
AND...I REALLY
DON'T WANT THAT.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.795
OK, WELL,
THEN LISTEN, BAILEY.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.797
THIS IS YOUR LIFE,
AND, UH,

36:30.797 --> 36:33.191
I'M CERTAINLY
NOT IN ANY POSITION

36:33.191 --> 36:34.844
TO SAY HOW
RELATIONSHIPS WORK,

36:34.844 --> 36:36.411
BUT I KNOW HOW THEY DON'T.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.718
AND WHAT I'M SEEING HERE--

36:38.718 --> 36:42.504
THIS--IF THIS IS
YOUR IDEA OF OK...

36:42.504 --> 36:44.506
THEN I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.900
DON'T SAY A WORD.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.481
HEY.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.091
WHERE YOU BEEN?

37:04.091 --> 37:05.440
LAST DAY HERE,

37:05.440 --> 37:08.878
I FIGURED I'D SPEND
MY PESOS DOWNSTAIRS.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.446
I FOUND THIS GREAT
BOUTIQUE,

37:11.446 --> 37:14.232
WITH ALL KINDS
OF CHEAP FABRICS
AND SILKS.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.624
LIKE THIS SCARF.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.365
AND THIS ONE.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.021
AMAZINGLY CHEAP.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.805
YOU COULD ALMOST JUST...

37:22.805 --> 37:25.199
USE THEM AND THEN...

37:25.199 --> 37:27.027
THROW THEM AWAY.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.072
THEY'RE REALLY SOFT.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.118
THEY WOULDN'T CHAFE YOU
AT ALL,

37:31.118 --> 37:33.033
LET'S SAY, ON YOUR...

37:33.033 --> 37:35.078
NECK OR YOUR...

37:35.078 --> 37:36.645
WRISTS.

37:36.645 --> 37:37.951
MY WRISTS.

37:37.951 --> 37:40.997
THAT WAS MY THOUGHT.

37:43.043 --> 37:46.046
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
PLAY CARDS?

37:50.268 --> 37:52.008
SALINGER!

37:52.008 --> 37:54.054
HEY!

37:59.451 --> 38:00.582
OH.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.192
DON'T SAY HI
OR ANYTHING.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.064
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.761
LOOK...

38:05.761 --> 38:07.110
I'M--I'M SORRY

38:07.110 --> 38:09.112
ABOUT THAT FIGHT
YESTERDAY.

38:09.112 --> 38:12.202
I DIDN'T BELONG THERE
BUTTING IN, AND...

38:12.202 --> 38:14.335
YOU DIDN'T NEED
MY HELP.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.337
ARE YOU KIDDING?

38:16.337 --> 38:17.338
NO, YOU--

38:17.338 --> 38:18.774
I MEAN...

38:18.774 --> 38:21.124
THANK YOU.

38:21.124 --> 38:24.214
SO, YOU GOT TIME TO SAY
HI TO SOME PEOPLE?

38:24.214 --> 38:28.044
MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN
DYING TO MEET YOU.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.655
YOUR FRIENDS...

38:29.655 --> 38:31.221
UM...

38:31.221 --> 38:32.962
MEET ME?

38:32.962 --> 38:33.963
COME ON.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.183
HEY, YOU GUYS.

38:36.183 --> 38:38.098
THIS IS CLAUDIA.

38:38.098 --> 38:40.143
YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE SONG.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.759
THE NEXT JOB,
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.326
IT'S GONNA PAY
REALLY GOOD.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.197
IT'S GONNA HAVE
SHORT HOURS,

38:50.197 --> 38:51.807
AND FOR DAY CARE,

38:51.807 --> 38:54.593
THEY'RE JUST--
THEY'RE GONNA LET YOU SIT

38:54.593 --> 38:57.335
IN YOUR NOT-SO-SUPERMOM'S
LAP.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.119
[VOCALIZES]

38:59.119 --> 39:00.599
YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M DREAMING.

39:02.514 --> 39:06.169
I'LL START LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING REAL TOMORROW.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.877
HEY, WHAT'S THE RUSH, RIGHT?

39:17.877 --> 39:21.141
THE NEXT DAY'S
JUST AS GOOD.

39:23.273 --> 39:26.668
'CAUSE JOBS ARE LIKE
PEOPLE YOU MEET.

39:26.668 --> 39:31.325
THE BEST ONES COME
WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKIN'.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.588
LIKE YOU AND ME.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.330
[LAUGHS]

39:42.031 --> 39:43.555
I CHECKED WITH CLAIRE.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.513
YOUR SCHEDULE'S FREE
FOR THE NEXT 40 MINUTES.

39:45.513 --> 39:46.688
EXCUSE ME?

39:46.688 --> 39:48.342
SO LET'S NOT WASTE
ANY TIME.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.735
I BROUGHT YOU A COPY
OF THE FIRST CHAPTER--

39:49.735 --> 39:51.432
YOU KNOW,
THIS REALLY ISN'T--

39:51.432 --> 39:52.651
IT'S INCREDIBLY ROUGH,
BUT IT GIVES
THE BASIC IDEA.

39:52.651 --> 39:55.305
I EXPLAINED HOW I WORK
TO YOU, JULIA.

39:55.305 --> 39:57.264
I KNOW.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.613
I KNOW, BUT...

39:58.613 --> 40:01.311
I'M NOT YOUR
TYPICAL AUTHOR.

40:01.311 --> 40:04.358
I'M 20 YEARS OLD.
I HAVE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

40:04.358 --> 40:07.317
SO...SO YOU BASICALLY
HAVE 2 CHOICES.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.319
ONE IS I WRITE THIS
ALONE,

40:09.319 --> 40:12.366
AND THE BOOK
THAT YOU GET
BY THE DEADLINE,

40:12.366 --> 40:13.498
IT'S NOT VERY SPECIAL.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.369
IT'S OK.
IT MAKES SENSE,

40:15.369 --> 40:16.326
BUT THE BOOK-BUYING
PUBLIC,

40:16.326 --> 40:17.632
THEY YAWN AND MOVE ON.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.504
NUMBER 2
IS THAT YOU HELP ME.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.593
I TOLD YOU,
I'M VERY SORRY--

40:21.593 --> 40:23.986
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE IT.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

40:23.986 --> 40:25.074
YOU JUST--
YOU HAVE TO...LISTEN.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.815
I'LL TALK
AND YOU LISTEN.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.730
I'LL THROW SOME STUFF OUT,
AND YOU JUST SAY WHAT YOU THINK

40:28.730 --> 40:30.340
OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.386
YOU JUST--YOU EDIT ME...
EVAN.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.432
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.955
JULIA...

40:35.955 --> 40:37.522
LISTEN, WHEN YOU
GAVE ME THIS BOOK,

40:37.522 --> 40:39.567
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO UNDERSTAND.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.787
YOU WANTED SOMEONE
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU

40:41.787 --> 40:44.137
HOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.444
WELL, I DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER...

40:46.444 --> 40:47.923
YET.

40:47.923 --> 40:50.448
BUT I BET I COULD FIND IT IF
SOMEONE WOULD HELP.

40:56.845 --> 40:59.500
40 MINUTES.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.460
LET'S SEE IT.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.462
DO YOU HAVE
A SPARE OUTLINE
FOR ME?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.464
UH-HUH.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.075
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS WIMPY

41:09.075 --> 41:11.294
USING THOSE SLIP KNOTS.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.296
NO, NOT AT ALL.

41:13.296 --> 41:15.734
YOUR POINT
WAS WELL TAKEN,
I THINK.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.300
FIRE SAFETY.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.998
[LAUGHING]

41:22.654 --> 41:24.656
SO IT WAS OK, THEN?

41:26.048 --> 41:27.833
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

41:27.833 --> 41:30.009
THE BEST.

41:30.009 --> 41:31.967
REALLY? THE BEST?

41:31.967 --> 41:34.709
LIKE IN
THE ABSOLUTE BEST?

41:35.928 --> 41:38.321
WELL...

41:38.321 --> 41:40.715
NO, THAT STILL BELONGS
TO THAT NIGHT--

41:40.715 --> 41:43.936
THE...LAST TIME
WE GOT BACK TOGETHER.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.546
YOU THINK SO?

41:45.546 --> 41:47.200
MMM...

41:50.595 --> 41:52.205
[TAKES DEEP BREATH]

41:52.205 --> 41:53.859
WOW.

41:53.859 --> 41:57.689
KIND OF MAKES ME
WANT TO SPILL
ALL MY SECRETS.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.908
NO. DON'T DO THAT.

42:01.301 --> 42:02.998
SURPRISE ME.

42:02.998 --> 42:05.261
[LAUGHING]

42:09.614 --> 42:12.399
[CLICKING PEN]

42:12.399 --> 42:14.009
[FOOTSTEPS]

42:14.009 --> 42:15.402
HEY.

42:15.402 --> 42:18.840
HEY, I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.234
YEAH.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.583
HEY.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.759
LISTEN,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

42:24.759 --> 42:25.978
'CAUSE THERE'S
A COUPLE OF THINGS--

42:25.978 --> 42:27.370
YOU KNOW HOW
THE FUNNIEST THINGS

42:27.370 --> 42:29.285
CAN MAKE YOU FEEL
REALLY HORNY?

42:29.285 --> 42:30.678
I'M SORRY?

42:30.678 --> 42:32.637
LIKE THE BACKSIDE
OF CERTAIN CONVERTIBLES

42:32.637 --> 42:35.422
OR...
A FUNNY-SHAPED PRETZEL?

42:35.422 --> 42:36.597
YEAH, I GUESS SO,
BUT--

42:36.597 --> 42:38.251
LOOK, BEFORE YOU
GET INTO THAT--

42:38.251 --> 42:40.253
WELL, TODAY
IN MY BIOETHICS CLASS,

42:40.253 --> 42:42.342
SOMEBODY USED THE WORD
"CHECKUP."

42:42.342 --> 42:45.301
WHICH AUTOMATICALLY
MADE ME THINK ABOUT
HOSPITAL GOWNS.

42:45.301 --> 42:47.521
YOU KNOW,
THOSE OPEN-BACKED THINGS?

42:47.521 --> 42:51.612
WHICH THEN LED ME
TO YOUR LITTLE PINK BUTT.

42:51.612 --> 42:54.528
MAN, I HAD TO
LEAVE THE ROOM.

42:54.528 --> 42:55.703
WOW.

42:57.662 --> 43:00.360
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE PUSHY,

43:00.360 --> 43:01.535
MY SWEET, BUT, UM,

43:01.535 --> 43:02.580
COULD YOU KINDLY STRIP?
