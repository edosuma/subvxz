WEBVTT

01:13.490 --> 01:17.160
You want me there on day one.
I should've dry-cleaned this.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.328
What's the point?

01:18.328 --> 01:19.913
In waiting a week?
- Yeah.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.041
I will no longer be jet-lagged.
I will be able to focus

01:23.041 --> 01:26.586
and graciously accept your help
getting me on my feet.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.672
But the first week is when you do that.
That's when you get on your feet.

01:29.672 --> 01:36.513
It wouldn't kill you to take a couple days
and just like... sit here and think.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.098
Figure out the next move.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.185
Maybe it's Kabul.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.895
Maybe that's the next move.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.525
Oh, you think the nation of Afghanistan
is not big enough for the both of us?

01:48.525 --> 01:50.693
- It isn't.
- What the fuck is this?

01:50.693 --> 01:53.947
- Put a few in my wallet.
- It should say "ambassador."

01:53.947 --> 01:56.783
- Not yet it shouldn't.
- I'm gonna write "ambassador" on there.

02:01.996 --> 02:07.001
Hello? Hi. She thinks she has to wait
for the embassy in Kabul to open

02:07.001 --> 02:09.504
before she can call herself "ambassador."

02:11.214 --> 02:12.632
Well, that's really fucking stupid.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.514
Kate, it's Tim.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.105
He's writing "ambassador" on my cards.
It looks like "ambulance."

02:27.105 --> 02:29.816
<i>Off the coast of Iran, a massive explosion</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:32.986
<i>aboard British aircraft carrier
HMS</i> Courageous

02:32.986 --> 02:36.072
<i>has killed
at least 25 Royal Navy personnel.</i>

02:36.072 --> 02:37.740
<i>Britain's Ministry of Defence is expected</i>

02:37.740 --> 02:39.659
<i>- to give a statement imminently.</i>
- What the fuck?

02:39.659 --> 02:42.453
- Tim, hang on a sec.
<i>- Earliest reports indicate the damage...</i>

02:42.453 --> 02:43.371
Hello?

02:43.371 --> 02:45.039
<i>Ms. Wyler?</i>
- Yes.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.458
<i>I have the chief of staff calling
from the White House.</i>

02:47.458 --> 02:49.127
- He's right here.
<i>- Ma'am...</i>

02:49.961 --> 02:51.296
- Hey, I'm back.
- Hello?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.591
- Why?
- Yeah.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.886
No, I get them going after us,
but why the Brits?

02:58.845 --> 03:00.763
Kate, they want a briefing.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.807
- At State?
- No, the White House.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.935
Okay. I gotta go.
White House wants Hal to brief.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.688
It'll take me ten minutes
to prep him. I'll call you back.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.606
Katie.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.108
Not me, you.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.491
Hello?

03:26.205 --> 03:27.040
Hey.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.502
- Come on in.
- Can your guy make two copies of this?

03:31.502 --> 03:34.797
I made a list of who in Tehran
could order a strike on a British vessel

03:34.797 --> 03:35.965
and who seemed pissed off

03:35.965 --> 03:38.509
- we took their tanker.
- I think they're all pissed off.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.637
But some tweeted about it
and not who you'd expect.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.055
Billie.
- We gotta go.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.973
I guess you can share one.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.600
This is Katherine Wyler.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.061
She was our number two
in Beirut and Islamabad.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.897
When we seized the tanker last week,

03:50.897 --> 03:55.109
the Iranian regime signaled its outrage
in a couple of unusual ways.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.027
What is she doing?

03:56.027 --> 03:58.905
She knows a lot about Iran. I didn't get
into what we wanted to discuss.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.324
This would be easier
if you each had your own copy.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.408
Have a seat.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.534
Okay.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.082
- How's Hal?
- He's good.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.708
He's a good man.
- Thank you.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.087
- Did great work in Afghanistan.
- Sure did.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.799
- We don't have anyone in London.
- Mm-hm.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.426
- A bad time not to have anyone in London.
- Right.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.763
Twenty-five of their sailors get killed
because Iran wants to send me a message.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.432
- We don't know it was Iran.
- Whoever it was,

04:26.432 --> 04:29.435
we need someone substantial
to be the ambassador in London.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.189
- He'll be great. He's a great choice.
- I'm sorry?

04:33.189 --> 04:35.358
Hal. And you didn't have to ask me.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.028
- We worked in different countries before.
- We're not talking about Hal.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.909
You're experienced.
You'd signal we're taking this seriously.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.287
You'd be at every funeral, memorial--

04:47.287 --> 04:49.080
Sorry, I'm going to Kabul.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.748
We'll take care of that.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.585
They'll love Hal in London.
He's good at all that.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.296
- It's not gonna be Hal.
- Why not?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.132
Because he called
the secretary of state a war criminal.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.509
I promised
I wouldn't send him anywhere ever again.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.930
I realize London
has a ceremonial component to it

05:05.930 --> 05:08.808
and you were ready
to do more substantive work in Kabul.

05:08.808 --> 05:13.813
I'm hoping to save a shred of what
we spent 2400 American lives building.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.857
It feels substantive.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.985
- Billie.
- I'm just saying it's hard to imagine.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.571
- She can't imagine it.
- The president is asking you to serve

05:21.571 --> 05:25.325
as ambassador to the United Kingdom.
We have a plane waiting.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.451
We'd like you to get on it.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.334
It is an honor and a privilege.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.919
That's more like it.

05:40.882 --> 05:45.053
It's exactly what they wanna hear. They've
been hosting garden parties for 50 years.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.138
The president
is asking you to take it up a notch.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.181
Mm-hm.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.934
- He picked you because you're experienced.
- He wants an experienced person

05:51.934 --> 05:54.687
- to show up and look sad.
- You're such a fucking snot.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.981
There was an argument
between Billie and the president

05:56.981 --> 06:00.318
about whether my mission
was to look guilty or just sad.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.945
People died. Showing up matters.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.031
I am an emotional support dog.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.578
- It was probably Iran.
- Please. They're broke.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.664
They don't want to bomb somebody for
taking their oil. They want the oil back.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.541
- So who?
- Russia, China, ISIS.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.336
Russia is not gonna torpedo
a British aircraft carrier.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.004
- Why not?
- Because they're busy.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.882
Takes the focus off Eastern Europe.
Gets the president bogged down

06:22.882 --> 06:24.926
in the Middle East,
makes him look like an asshole.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.720
It's a British vessel.
You don't wanna consider the possibility

06:27.720 --> 06:30.139
it was attacked
because someone doesn't like the British?

06:30.139 --> 06:34.143
- My hands are swelling. This is not good.
- Whoever it was, the Gulf is on fire.

06:34.143 --> 06:38.731
The president is sending you to stop a war
before it starts, not... butter a crumpet.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.741
White House wants you in the SCIF.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.536
We're screening imagery
from the Pentagon, NSA and NGA,

06:51.536 --> 06:53.663
- see if we can figure out who did it.
- I have a guess.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.790
- We're not guessing.
- My guess is Iran.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.291
<i>Is the door closed?</i>

06:59.001 --> 07:00.878
- Yeah.
<i>- Still seeing that girl?</i>

07:00.878 --> 07:03.548
Twenty-five British sailors just died.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.844
<i>Gonna tell you something five people know.
You're six. I don't want her to be seven.</i>

07:09.137 --> 07:12.890
- I won't tell her.
<i>- We're gonna lose the vice president.</i>

07:13.808 --> 07:15.143
Like, die?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.855
<i>Resign. Something will come out,
she'll get knocked around for awhile,</i>

07:18.855 --> 07:20.898
<i>then step down. Maybe six months.</i>

07:21.482 --> 07:23.985
- Whoa.
-<i>Yeah. So we need somebody else.</i>

07:24.610 --> 07:26.154
<i>And I have a few ideas.</i>

07:26.154 --> 07:29.115
<i>But one of them...
I want you to check her out.</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:30.908
<i>Tell me if I'm crazy.</i>

07:30.908 --> 07:34.704
<i>Her corridor rep is fantastic,
but she's a little...</i>

07:35.371 --> 07:36.664
- What?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

07:36.664 --> 07:39.459
<i>- Needs a haircut.</i>
- Pfft. No.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.752
<i>I'm not asking
for "return of the kingmaker."</i>

07:41.752 --> 07:46.048
<i>- Just take a look. Tell me what you think.</i>
- When you call me that, it makes it worse.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.426
<i>- Kingmaker? I'm sorry.</i>
- No, you're not.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.472
<i>You're right. I'm not. I'm asking you
a favor and you're being a pain in my ass.</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:54.474
And you're being a bully. No means no.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.936
<i>You can't say no. I put her on a plane.
She's gonna be your new ambassador.</i>

08:07.862 --> 08:08.863
Thank you.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.784
Welcome to London, Ambassador Wyler.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.287
I'm Stuart Hayford,
your deputy chief of mission.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.540
I guess this is what
arranged marriage feels like.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.919
- Gwen Hempill from the Foreign Office.
- Such a pleasure.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.463
I'm so sorry.
What a terrible thing that's happened.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.216
Ambassador Wyler, it is an honor.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.010
Call me Hal. One ambassador is plenty.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.387
- Have the numbers changed?
- Twenty-eight casualties.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.306
Search and rescue is still looking.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.524
Jesus Christ.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.739
This is Frances Munning,
the residence manager.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.492
- Welcome to Winfield House, ambassador.
- Thank you.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.037
Hello, everyone.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.122
Hello, ma'am.

09:41.122 --> 09:45.918
- And welcome to you, Ambassador Wyler.
- Call me Hal. One ambassador's plenty.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.169
Perhaps Mr. Wyler.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.213
Please. Follow me.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.301
We gonna do this every time?

09:58.806 --> 10:03.477
The house was purchased by Barbara Hutton
shortly before her marriage to Cary Grant.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.731
Big piece of land
for right in the middle of London.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.400
Miss Hutton moved to Winfield
with her young son

10:09.400 --> 10:12.194
just after the abduction
of the Lindbergh baby.

10:12.194 --> 10:16.240
Regent's Park provided,
you know, a reassuring perimeter.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.161
The only private garden in London
larger than Winfield is Buckingham Palace.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.662
Oh, for God's sake.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.499
<i>The vice president was missing</i>

10:25.499 --> 10:27.209
<i>from yesterday's Situation Room meeting.</i>

10:27.209 --> 10:29.378
<i>Her office cited schedule constraints,</i>

10:29.378 --> 10:32.757
<i>but there's a growing sense of frustration
among supporters...</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:35.885
The president is talking to the PM
at 12:00. He wants her on the call.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.763
- Holy shit.
- Fancy.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.891
- Ambassador Vayle wasn't on those calls.
- Yeah.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.561
Everything all right?

10:45.561 --> 10:49.690
I showed them around.
She checked the sheets in the Adams Suite.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.235
- Okay.
- To see if they were on the bed.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.781
Were they?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.450
Yes.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.874
After your call
with the president and prime minister,

11:06.874 --> 11:10.461
you'll go to the Foreign Office
and present a copy of your credentials.

11:10.461 --> 11:14.006
Is the secretary of state
on the call with the president?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.425
Ganon? He shouldn't be.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.302
- Neither should I.
- He's not.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.347
In the afternoon,
you'll visit the Greenwich Naval Memorial.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.265
To lay a wreath
in honor of the fallen sailors.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.434
- Right.
- And at the end of the day,

11:25.434 --> 11:29.146
we'll have a rehearsal for
the official presentation of credentials.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.192
- Why are we doing it twice?
You can't start work

11:33.192 --> 11:35.736
until you give a copy of your credentials
to the Foreign Office.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.365
Then you'll submit them officially
at Buckingham Palace.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.118
We try to do a dry run with all the gear.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.621
There have been issues
getting in and out of the carriage.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.333
- Carriage?
- Mrs. Vayle split her skirt up the back.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.919
- Then the horses--
- Nothing to worry about.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.506
Did you pack a dress, maybe tea-length?

11:56.590 --> 11:57.591
No.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.553
- Pippa.
- We have a stylist.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.639
She'll come by the embassy.
You get a top hat and tails.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.975
This is today? When is the ceremony?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.895
We're not sure exactly, but if we can run
the rehearsal, we'd like to.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.606
So you can photograph it?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.401
Inviting a couple reporters?

12:16.152 --> 12:19.113
- One. She's good, she'll do a feature.
- Push it.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.491
Give them a break.
They need a picture for the website.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.744
- On a horse?
They'll do before and after photos.

12:25.744 --> 12:29.498
First-time ambassador.
Lean into the Cinderella thing.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.083
I am not Cinderella.

12:31.083 --> 12:35.671
I'm here for 30 funerals. The only
tea-length garment I packed is a burka.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.257
I have a black suit
and another black suit,

12:38.924 --> 12:41.886
and I'm not getting dressed
by someone named Pippa

12:41.886 --> 12:44.263
so a women's magazine
can ask who I'm wearing

12:44.263 --> 12:46.348
and what advice I have for little girls.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.851
It's fine. We'll ditch it.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.562
Great.
- We're gonna head over to the embassy.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.647
If you'd like to join us,
sit in on a briefing?

12:53.647 --> 12:54.899
- Sure.
- Okay, Hal?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.905
I think I'm gonna stretch my legs.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.083
My husband was an ambassador for
a long time. This will be an adjustment.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.335
Of course.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.253
- Him tagging along is not--
- Copy.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.883
- Let's get the cars.
She'll need a minute to change.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.218
Uh-huh.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.219
Into...?

13:24.678 --> 13:27.139
Something... more?

13:33.562 --> 13:35.481
Get your feet off the furniture.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.359
Barbara Hutton fucked Cary Grant
on this table.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.444
They want you at the memorial at 3:00.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.238
I'll have them call
if we're running behind.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.740
You are no longer in charge
of my movements.

13:45.407 --> 13:48.827
Yeah, but I don't wanna wait for an hour
because no one can find you.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.749
Not great.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.213
Call Darya, tell her to stop saying,
"Afghan women's health."

13:59.213 --> 14:02.007
She has to use words
like "atrocity, dismemberment."

14:02.007 --> 14:04.927
- Who's she talking to?
- I don't know, UNHCR.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.554
Someone in Pakistan.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.683
"Sit in on a briefing"?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.310
It would have been rude of him
not to offer.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.728
You didn't have to say yes.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.065
Did you or did you not ask me
to help get your feet on the ground

14:18.065 --> 14:20.067
or your ass in the saddle
or whatever it was?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.318
Is that okay?

14:21.318 --> 14:23.612
- Better.
- Sure? I can do the pit wash.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.780
You don't need it.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.578
- Is it bad?
- No, it's good.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.037
Oh, my God, stop. Stop.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.790
You're perfect.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.709
Fuck you. Am I okay?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.464
What are you gonna say to him?
The prime minister.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.843
I am a listener on the call.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.888
That is the opposite
of ass in the saddle, Kate.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.057
More than once, I've told you,
when you land in a new post,

14:52.057 --> 14:55.269
there is some wisdom
in spending a week or a month

14:55.269 --> 14:59.440
- with your mouth shut, listening.
- I never did it. It was a dumb idea.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.108
Rayburn is gonna talk about NATO,

15:01.108 --> 15:03.319
but you're here
to patch things up with the Brits.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.946
- Keep the focus tight.
- I'm not doing this the way you would.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.990
That's fine. Just don't do it wrong.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.020
Morning, ambassador. Morning, sir.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.855
Welcome to Embassy London.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.566
We'll show you your office later.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.735
We need to get you on the call
with the president.

16:00.417 --> 16:04.004
Good morning, ambassador. Eidra Park.
Welcome to Embassy London.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.506
CIA chief of station.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.425
You are having a day.
- We are.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.011
These are the latest images
of the carrier.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.098
- From?
- Air Force drones in the Gulf.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.766
And this is yesterday,

16:15.766 --> 16:19.645
HMS <i>Courageous</i> on its way to joint
exercises with us in the Indian Ocean.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.772
They clocked some instability
in a propeller

16:21.772 --> 16:24.942
and diverted to the Royal Navy Base
in Bahrain for repairs.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.277
- Nobody spent a long time planning this.
No.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.946
- Weapon fragments?
Not yet.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.990
The investigation hasn't ramped up.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.909
- Still pulling bodies out of the water.
Yeah. I've got her.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.496
The president and the prime minister
will be on in a second.

16:38.914 --> 16:39.915
Thank you.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.128
<i>Good morning.</i>

16:44.128 --> 16:46.547
<i>I have President Rayburn
and Ambassador-designate Wyler</i>

16:46.547 --> 16:47.881
<i>for Prime Minister Trowbridge.</i>

16:47.881 --> 16:50.676
<i>Thank you so much.
I'll connect the prime minister.</i>

16:50.676 --> 16:52.469
<i>Mr. President?</i>

16:52.469 --> 16:54.847
<i>Nicol, what a fucking horror show.</i>

16:58.434 --> 16:59.893
Sorry about the wall.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.311
It's frightfully bare.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.565
There was a Jackson Pollock up there.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.484
It was a bit of a zing
among all the old masters.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.155
- The Vayles took most of their art home.
- Mm-hm.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.950
They left the Titian in the drawing room.
Donation to the house.

17:15.659 --> 17:16.869
- Generous.
- Isn't it?

17:17.911 --> 17:20.956
Have you and Ambassador Wyler
arranged for the shipping of yours,

17:20.956 --> 17:23.333
or is that something with which
I could be of assistance?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.462
Our art?

17:26.462 --> 17:27.504
Mm-hm.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.008
Kate's a career officer.
Not a political appointee.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.390
Ronald Vayle, he became ambassador,

17:38.390 --> 17:41.435
because he raised $2 million
for the president.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.605
Like most American ambassadors
in gorgeous European posts.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.564
Goodness.

17:45.564 --> 17:50.069
Kate and I are like British ambassadors.
Lot of experience in crisis zones.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.238
- No art.
- I'm so sorry.

17:53.864 --> 17:54.990
We're okay with it.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.078
Could you direct me toward my driver?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.163
- Pardon?
- Driver of my car.

18:01.163 --> 18:05.417
I'm sorry, you don't have one. Or a car.
Mrs. Vayle purchased a Jaguar

18:05.417 --> 18:08.879
and hired a driver,
but she's had it sent back to the States.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.132
The Jaguar. Not the driver.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.803
Shall I call you a taxi?

18:19.515 --> 18:23.685
Death toll's up to 32, and the president
offered to carpet-bomb Tehran.

18:23.685 --> 18:27.564
- What did the PM say?
- He was polite but I'm sure he's worried.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.192
I'll try to dial it down when we speak
to the foreign secretary.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.403
That could take a moment.
To get to the foreign secretary.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.572
Secretary of state hasn't called him yet.

18:35.572 --> 18:39.868
And likely won't until he's had a chance
to speak with the Saudis and the UAE.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.788
- Secretary Ganon hasn't called him yet?
- No.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.081
So I can't call him.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.250
Yeah, you really can't call anyone.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.502
The whole thing is not ideal.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.060
This is your wing.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.818
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ambassador-designate Katherine Wyler.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.862
- Welcome, ambassador.
- Welcome, ma'am.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.114
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor, ma'am.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.199
- Nice to meet you. Wow.
- Nice to have you here.

19:19.199 --> 19:23.537
- Morning. There are a lot of you. Hi.
Welcome to the embassy.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.790
Ma'am, I have Ambassador Wyler
on the phone for you.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.379
- Would you like to take it in your office?
- Um...

19:32.379 --> 19:33.839
It's that one, right there.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.465
Yup.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.971
- I'll connect you.
- Thanks.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.449
Hi.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.951
- How did it go?
- Fine. What's wrong?

20:03.827 --> 20:06.413
- You had a driver in Beirut, right?
- Yes.

20:06.413 --> 20:10.042
This place has six gardeners,
and the wife doesn't get a car.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.668
<i>We were not married in Beirut.</i>

20:11.668 --> 20:14.338
I had a driver
because I was a deputy chief of mission.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.506
- None of the wives gets a car?
<i>- I swear to God.</i>

20:16.506 --> 20:19.801
I need to get out,
let people know you're here.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.387
No, you don't.
Neither of us can do anything,

20:22.387 --> 20:24.932
because Ganon isn't calling the Brits
till this afternoon.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.891
What?

20:25.891 --> 20:28.518
Too busy whipping the Sunni coalition
into a frenzy.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.437
He's a fucking moron.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.647
<i>Well, he's my boss.</i>

20:31.647 --> 20:32.731
He shouldn't be.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.317
Did you call Darya?
<i>- No.</i>

20:35.317 --> 20:37.736
- I will. I will.
<i>- I should be in Kabul.</i>

20:37.736 --> 20:40.113
Ganon isn't repairing
the North Atlantic Alliance.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.115
He's swinging his dick
around the Persian Gulf.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.493
<i>Washington doesn't have
a UK problem, Kate.</i>

20:44.493 --> 20:47.704
Washington has an Iran problem.
You're the one with the UK problem.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.791
If you think the foreign secretary
needs attention, call him.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.336
- Ganon would shit a live ostrich.
- Why?

20:54.336 --> 20:58.674
Any idea how much planning went into
the batting order on your phone sheet?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.384
It sounds scintillating.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.845
The president calls, the secretary
of state calls, the Pentagon calls.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.682
- Jesus Christ.
<i>- Don't act like it's bullshit.</i>

21:06.682 --> 21:10.394
It's about fundamental respect
for institutional norms.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.312
<i>You're covering Ganon's ass for him.</i>

21:12.312 --> 21:15.440
It's not a betrayal
of rules-based democracy.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.484
<i>You're gonna be in Dennison's office.
Do a pop-by.</i>

21:17.484 --> 21:18.860
Okay. Hal, I gotta go.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.396
Ready to tie the knot?

21:56.481 --> 22:00.444
Robin will memorialize the moment,
if I can locate our spot--

22:00.444 --> 22:04.573
We like to do it in front
of Britannia grasping hands with America,

22:04.573 --> 22:06.950
but more and more
we find it's problematic.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.746
Africa as a young naked boy,
and Australia in nothing but a bush hat.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.206
Good afternoon. Mind if I say hello?

22:13.206 --> 22:16.710
Oh, wonderful. Foreign Secretary
Austin Dennison, this is--

22:16.710 --> 22:19.421
Ambassador Wyler,
if she's handed over that document.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.341
She's done it, but we've not yet
photographed it, so it may not be real.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.969
- Sir, it's an honor to meet you.
- Pleasure. Stuart.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.137
Good to see you, sir.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.307
Gwen, mind if I steal her for a moment,
or does that muck up your day?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.934
Of course. What a stroke of luck.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.353
Tell Davies to go ahead.
- Ma'am.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.105
- I know.
- Small talk. Weather.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.696
I'm so sorry for your loss.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.990
We're grateful to have you
jumping into the fray.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.200
Of course.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.911
The prime minister was moved,
speaking with President Rayburn.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.914
I believe he's very much
on the front foot.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.584
He is. I know the secretary of state
is eager to talk to you.

22:57.584 --> 23:02.089
I think he just wants to make sure
his ducks are in a row before he does.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.009
The carrier is drifting, I've learned.
Rather unfortunate.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.303
- Which way?
- Towards Iran.

23:08.970 --> 23:12.015
- Oh, God.
- It's quite vulnerable out there.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.727
We need to be sure
we're keeping the temperature low.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.938
I'll inform the secretary of state.

23:17.938 --> 23:21.441
I was just about to brief
the prime minister. Can you join?

23:21.441 --> 23:24.528
- You met him on the phone.
- I'm not sure that's a great idea.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.407
Sorry to disturb.
- Ah!

23:29.908 --> 23:32.035
Not at all, we were due a break.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.788
That or ritual suicide.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.958
Ambassador Katherine Wyler,
Prime Minister Nicol Trowbridge.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.627
Welcome, welcome.
We hear wonderful things.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.380
- Sir, it's an honor to meet you.
- Ah. Honor to be met.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.883
- Rayburn didn't let you get a word in.
- Ah.

23:46.883 --> 23:50.470
Brilliant of him sending you.
Experienced. Professional. Female.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.347
I am many of those things.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.890
- I'm so sorry--

23:53.890 --> 23:56.434
You know the last female ambassador
to the Court of St. James's?

23:56.434 --> 23:59.020
- Long time ago.
- Over a hundred years.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.398
- Fifty, but yes.
- What a proud tradition you've had.

24:02.023 --> 24:06.319
Captains of industry spending a year
on holiday whilst we've got work to do.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.322
You and I, I'm sure,
will accomplish things together.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.158
I certainly hope we will.
That's why I'm here.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.494
There's a mess in the Gulf, but you know
the players. You'll be a great help.

24:15.287 --> 24:19.875
We should-- Let's hole us up
somewhere where they can't find us.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.635
Good afternoon.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.806
- Good day, sir.
- Hal Wyler. Nice to meet you.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.852
- I'm the ambassador's wife.
- Oh. Oh, not at all, sir.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.981
We're the Metropolitan Police,
here to keep you and the ambassador safe.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.733
And we couldn't be more grateful.

24:46.484 --> 24:48.820
- Is that your car?
- Uh, it is, sir. Yeah.

24:50.655 --> 24:54.409
- Trouble you for a lift?
- Wish I could. Official business only.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.619
Okay, I understand.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.539
- Might I book you a cab?
- Oh, I'm gonna take a walk.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.583
- Nice to meet you.
- You too, sir.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.008
- Sir! Sir!

25:11.051 --> 25:14.262
Oh, my goodness, I am so sorry.

25:14.262 --> 25:16.598
Of course, you drive
on the other side of the road.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.526
The president freaked them out.

25:28.526 --> 25:30.946
They're worried he's gonna
threaten to bomb Tehran.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.239
Then they're really in it.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.824
I'm sure he's trying to make them feel
like he's paying attention.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.410
They want him to keep quiet.
Let the Brits set the tone.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.914
- Okay. Ganon can get into it.
- They want me to handle it.

25:41.706 --> 25:42.582
That isn't great.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.293
This is exactly what Hal did
to Ganon in Tel Aviv.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.254
Blew in and made
the whole American delegation

25:47.254 --> 25:49.923
look like they were sitting around
with their thumbs up their asses.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.717
But this isn't you
charging into the PM's office.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.679
The foreign secretary tracked you down.
That was his idea.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.555
Was it?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.392
Hal.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.893
- Really?
- Yup.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.020
You think your husband--?

26:04.020 --> 26:08.608
Pulled me out of a photo op
and dumped me in the PM's lap? Yeah.

26:08.608 --> 26:11.695
Okay. Wow. Impressive.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.698
You say that now. Always comes at a cost.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.866
- Which is what?
- You don't know until you know.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.369
But then you definitely know.

26:21.538 --> 26:25.166
Well, at this point,
they're asking you to step in.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.376
You kind of have to.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.589
Mr. Secretary,
the prime minister understands

26:31.589 --> 26:34.175
the attack may have been a message for us.

26:34.175 --> 26:37.595
But the president signaled
quite a lot of outrage

26:37.595 --> 26:39.723
when he spoke to the prime minister,

26:39.723 --> 26:43.393
and they're worried he may make
a public statement before they're able--

26:43.393 --> 26:45.353
<i>It was a condolence call
for 30 servicemen.</i>

26:45.353 --> 26:48.565
<i>Exactly what was he supposed
to signal if not outrage?</i>

26:48.565 --> 26:51.568
I think what troubled them
was the statement,

26:52.694 --> 26:56.865
"If I find out it was Iran, I swear,
we're gonna light the place up."

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
<i>I'm sure that's not what he said.</i>

27:00.243 --> 27:02.245
It's exactly what he said.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.413
<i>You got a readout?</i>

27:06.541 --> 27:07.751
I was on the call.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.880
<i>Wasn't I sending you to Kabul?</i>

27:11.880 --> 27:16.968
Sir, no one is more surprised
to find me here than I am.

27:16.968 --> 27:20.263
<i>I don't know, ambassador.
I haven't called the foreign secretary.</i>

27:20.263 --> 27:25.226
<i>You've been at post for an hour and
you talked to the prime minister. Twice.</i>

27:25.226 --> 27:26.644
They want us involved,

27:26.644 --> 27:31.191
but not if we're planning to attack
an unstable regime without any evidence.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.985
<i>Inform your friend the PM
that Rayburn's a lot of talk.</i>

27:33.985 --> 27:36.696
<i>He's not planning to "light up"
the Republic of Iran.</i>

27:36.696 --> 27:39.908
They need to hear it from you.
On its face, it's credible.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.412
We have an elderly president
who just lost the House

27:44.412 --> 27:48.875
and we have a young VP who'd be
glad to prove she likes to blow things up.

27:48.875 --> 27:52.629
<i>That is my problem. Not yours.</i>

27:53.588 --> 27:57.342
Not if they can't get you on the phone,
sir, then apparently it's mine.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.056
He'll keep the president
off the air for a day.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.267
- One?
- Doesn't help, does it?

28:07.477 --> 28:11.064
It's not nothing.
They'll appreciate its non-nothingness.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.566
Very close to nothing.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.304
Raymond Braysdale, MP Aberconwy.

28:48.184 --> 28:50.270
Ambassador Wyler, United States.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.497
Ma'am, look at me.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.292
Mr. Wyler's here. Does he know Meg--?

29:12.292 --> 29:13.501
Don't look over there.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.337
- Does he know Meg Roylin?
- I don't know.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.923
- Is he talking to Meg whoever?
- Roylin.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.760
- Is that a problem?
- She's a Tory operative.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.429
She built the strategy
behind Trowbridge's campaign.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.473
Then he fired her
when the papers started saying

29:26.473 --> 29:28.558
she was the brains behind the operation.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.936
She takes racists
and turns them into lovable guys

29:31.936 --> 29:34.439
you wish had time to coach peewee soccer.

29:34.981 --> 29:38.318
Remember I told you
there would be a price? For Dennison?

29:46.826 --> 29:48.828
<i>Hey.</i>
- Stop moving.

29:48.828 --> 29:52.290
- How did it go at the Foreign Office?
- You know exactly how it went.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.460
I'll be right there,
but I got someone I want you to meet.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.837
- No. Absolutely no.
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

29:58.505 --> 30:00.965
Bad connection. Come on.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.177
Now you've met my husband.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.474
Pull her.

30:10.892 --> 30:11.893
Really?

30:11.893 --> 30:15.438
Your first media hit in the country
can't be a candid with Meg Roylin.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.732
Pardon us. Thank you, thank you.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.569
Step aside, please.
Pardon us. Step aside, please.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.030
- This way, ma'am.
- Step aside. Metropolitan Police.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.490
- This is a lot.
- This way.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.575
She's not in cardiac arrest.
We're just trying to go.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.244
Sir? Thank you, sir.

30:31.704 --> 30:32.914
- Not today.
- So sorry.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.375
Not to worry. I'll call you. Thank you.

30:42.131 --> 30:45.385
Sir, your name, please?
- Ambassador Wyler, United States.

31:00.066 --> 31:02.735
- Are you okay?
- Twitter said it was a threat on her life.

31:02.735 --> 31:07.198
We had Meg Roylin coming from one side and
Jamie Taro of the <i>Daily Mail</i> on the other.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.409
I can't have that be the first image
that shows up

31:09.409 --> 31:11.494
when you google
"Ambassador Katherine Wyler."

31:11.494 --> 31:15.665
It says Ambassador Wyler's leaving
the memorial right now. In a police car.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.043
- Clearly she's not.
- Is it, perhaps, the other one?

31:20.295 --> 31:22.130
The other Ambassador Wyler.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.674
We got a call earlier.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.968
Mr. Wyler borrowed a vehicle.

31:27.677 --> 31:28.720
From the police?

31:29.470 --> 31:34.058
Oh. The press office sent a nice piece
about you at the memorial-- Hang on.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.644
Uh, "U.S. Ambassador Wyler

31:36.644 --> 31:39.188
pays his respects
at the Greenwich Naval Memorial

31:39.188 --> 31:42.901
on his first day as representative
to the Court of St. James's."

31:44.444 --> 31:46.195
- Hmm.
Stuart Hayford's office.

31:47.906 --> 31:48.740
Eidra.

31:51.034 --> 31:51.993
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.829
Members of parliament
are canceling visits to Greenwich.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.457
Security concerns raised
by your hasty exit.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.083
It was a misunderstanding.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.793
It's a fast boat. We can't see markings,

32:00.793 --> 32:03.504
but it definitely looks like
the kind Iran's been stockpiling.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.214
Shit.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.674
- Yeah.
- Why?

32:06.674 --> 32:07.717
Means it's Iran.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.219
Means it's an Iranian boat.

32:10.219 --> 32:13.014
Israeli satellites clocked it
off the coast near Sirik.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.515
- Which is...?
- In Iran.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.101
Is that something everyone knows?

32:17.101 --> 32:19.604
It's a very small coastal village in Iran.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.774
They lose track of it here,
but the timing lines up.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.693
- When did this come in?
- Few minutes ago.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.153
- Does State have it?
- Ganon?

32:27.153 --> 32:30.615
- I'm sure he got it when we did.
- You think my day holds?

32:31.199 --> 32:34.994
The Brits asked her to keep the president
quiet until the carrier's in a safer spot.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.996
- And the White House agreed?
- Ganon agreed.

32:36.996 --> 32:40.583
For a day. When there wasn't
real evidence pointing at Iran.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.877
It's not an indictment. It's a boat.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.505
In the right place at the right time.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.299
I should tell Dennison I got the day
before it's gone.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.677
We gotta get you to your town hall.

32:51.552 --> 32:52.428
Your speech.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.890
Kill it. I hate speeches.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.434
Can you hang back a minute?

33:00.687 --> 33:02.730
The job is like 80% speeches.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.945
- They asked me to slow-roll her clearance.
- Who?

33:12.907 --> 33:14.075
Ganon?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.121
Shit.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.541
There could be plenty of reasons for that.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.458
Really?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.879
No. He wants to get rid of her.

33:28.965 --> 33:29.799
Shit.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.430
- Why give her a day?
- Probably thought it'd take that long

33:35.430 --> 33:38.558
to find a reason to get her out,
but now we have her husband

33:38.558 --> 33:42.103
stealing a police car
and conspiring with shady Tories.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.312
Can I use the SCIF?

33:47.942 --> 33:49.027
What do you think?

33:49.694 --> 33:50.528
- Of her?
- Yeah.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.866
I'm impressed. I was dubious at first,
but she turned me around.

33:55.491 --> 33:58.995
I think I'll ditch my plans to move to
a place with better career opportunities

33:59.871 --> 34:02.457
so I can stand by her side
for a tour that'll reinvigorate

34:02.457 --> 34:05.251
the special relationship
and usher in a new American century.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.170
Give her a chance.

34:08.087 --> 34:11.924
I'm not fucking her, I'm fucking you.
I'm trying to give you a chance.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.392
What happened?

34:21.392 --> 34:23.644
The five people
who know what's going on here...

34:23.644 --> 34:25.938
-<i>Yeah.</i>
- The secretary of state's one of them.

34:25.938 --> 34:26.856
<i>Right?</i>

34:30.068 --> 34:31.986
-<i>No.</i>
- What the fuck, Billie?

34:31.986 --> 34:34.489
-<i>He doesn't need to know.</i>
- He's trying to shitcan her.

34:34.489 --> 34:38.159
- I'm sure he's not.
- She wound up in a sit-down with the PM,

34:38.159 --> 34:41.329
thanks to the husband,
who by the way, Jesus fucking Christ.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.247
He's a handful, but people love him.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.208
<i>Ganon thinks she's eating off his plate.</i>

34:45.833 --> 34:48.920
The president needs to say out loud
that he asked her to take the lead here.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.421
<i>It's not gonna happen.</i>

34:50.421 --> 34:54.008
It's a test. The president wants to see
if she can handle herself.

34:54.634 --> 34:57.220
- If she's afraid of Ganon...
- She's not.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.222
<i>That's the kind of information I need.</i>

34:59.222 --> 35:00.681
It's why I read you in.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.520
Is that why you read me in?

35:05.520 --> 35:07.772
Or are you asking me
to turn her into something?

35:08.856 --> 35:11.067
I don't know. Maybe.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.862
- That's the clarity I'm looking for.
-<i>I don't have a lot of clarity.</i>

35:14.862 --> 35:16.572
I just spent three years building a VP

35:16.572 --> 35:19.158
who could take the torch from an old man
and get us another term.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.077
<i>This was not my plan.</i>

35:22.078 --> 35:24.580
She handles things.
We get people who can campaign.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.415
They can't handle anything
and we're drowning.

35:26.415 --> 35:30.128
Oh, fuck that. You see an opportunity,
you can't let it go by.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.381
Yeah, I can't.
Who do you think taught me that?

35:37.093 --> 35:38.386
No, "atrocity."

35:38.970 --> 35:42.723
Atrocity. It means "killing people
and hacking them up into little pieces."

35:45.434 --> 35:47.186
Darya, if you say "women's health,"

35:47.186 --> 35:50.064
they think they're funding a yoga studio
in Jalalabad.

35:51.065 --> 35:53.151
Listen, I gotta go. Okay.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.946
Ganon's trying to get rid of you.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.701
That was fast.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.870
An apology could take the edge off.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.999
He's trying to keep the Gulf
from boiling over.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.585
I'm not calling him
to say I made an oopsie.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.461
Might be worth it.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.466
Hmm. In a week,
the Brits will have set the tone.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.344
- Ganon won't remember any of this.
- Ma'am...

36:23.973 --> 36:26.475
you are not gonna be here in a week.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.227
You're not on the books yet.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.772
Ganon will have to do some explaining,
but he'll blame Hal,

36:31.772 --> 36:33.524
which won't take much convincing.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.694
You called him Hal.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.237
First time.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.365
Sorry.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.745
Everyone does once they really know him.
Guess you got the idea.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.331
I did.

36:55.504 --> 36:56.756
Maybe it's all right.

36:58.424 --> 36:59.675
What does that mean?

37:00.885 --> 37:05.514
You don't seem to be all that thrilled
to be here. It's not Jalalabad.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.685
Someone is shooting missiles
at boats in the Persian Gulf.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.605
Even I can get it up
for averting another bloodbath

37:12.605 --> 37:14.398
- in the motherfucking Gulf.
- Sorry.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.484
I was just asking.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.077
Who was gonna do the feature?

37:27.411 --> 37:28.246
The rehearsal.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.665
Me in a gown, with a horse.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.875
-<i>British Vogue.</i>

37:34.835 --> 37:36.170
God, I hate this shit.

37:39.715 --> 37:40.800
What?

37:42.843 --> 37:44.512
You know who you can't fire?

37:46.514 --> 37:47.515
Cinderella.

37:52.103 --> 37:56.816
I'm not sure if this is the same schedule.
I don't think anything has changed.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.402
Pensy, find Leonard if you could, please.

38:02.738 --> 38:06.492
The article won't be online till tomorrow,
but they'll put pictures on the website.

38:06.492 --> 38:09.787
It's fucking brilliant.
A media darling by sunup.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.914
- Fucking brilliant.
It is.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.417
Told you you were ready.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.461
You and I did all the things we do
to launch you.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.381
Drop-kicked me
into the center of the action,

38:20.381 --> 38:24.302
so I can make promises I can't keep,
while alienating my superiors

38:24.302 --> 38:27.346
for a strategically insignificant
moment of access.

38:28.139 --> 38:32.143
And now we're distracting
from the clusterfuck with a media splash

38:32.143 --> 38:34.645
designed to make me
more attractive to women.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.646
You're a snob.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.231
Zip this.

38:37.231 --> 38:38.316
And a misogynist.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.570
You're the prime minister's new
best friend and you're gonna be famous.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.655
I should be getting a blow job
for that phone call.

38:44.655 --> 38:48.743
I didn't wanna be famous. You're so famous
nobody wants to work with you.

38:57.001 --> 39:01.130
How is this a $1600 piece of clothing?
It doesn't even have pockets.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.716
Makes your ass look fantastic.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.017
We look good.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.072
Wow.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.656
I'm not a dress person.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.992
- You're faking it spectacularly.
- Okay.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.953
We'll start with candids
for the <i>Vogue</i> spread,

39:32.953 --> 39:35.373
and then some formal portraits for us.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.208
The body count went up, 41 dead.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.501
Yeah.

39:38.501 --> 39:42.004
Oh, ma'am, ma'am.
Uma is outside, whenever you're ready.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.214
- Uma?
- The reporter.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.634
Okay. They may want more help
with the search.

39:46.634 --> 39:49.512
There's a guy
I should call at the Pentagon.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.639
Ma'am, I'll talk to the guy.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.559
And I talk to Uma.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.769
Give me your phone.

39:57.853 --> 40:01.982
His name is Gerald Tober.
He runs maritime search and rescue.

40:05.569 --> 40:06.904
I used to do your job.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.198
It is better than this one.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.034
Ma'am...

40:13.119 --> 40:14.662
I am sorry about today.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.206
- You knew the thing with Dennison was--
- Don't worry about it.

40:18.082 --> 40:22.378
- Hal makes a lot of magic. Hard to resist.
- Well, next time I'll know.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.131
You won't.
It's like a drug. You can't say no.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.675
It's okay, he'll be gone soon.

40:28.968 --> 40:32.304
- He will?
- Let's get a look at you. It's perfect.

40:33.055 --> 40:35.182
- I think it is. Right?
- Absolutely.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.184
- Let's look at you in the light.
Okay.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.022
Frances?

40:42.022 --> 40:43.149
Mr. Hayford.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.903
Why did you tell me about the sheets?

40:48.988 --> 40:52.324
- You said she checked the sheets.
- In the Adams Suite.

40:52.825 --> 40:56.120
You asked for relevant information.
It's a guest suite.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.748
They don't sleep in the same bed.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.217
I don't wanna make your job
any harder than it already is,

41:10.217 --> 41:13.888
but it would be great
if there weren't any shots of me

41:13.888 --> 41:18.058
looking wistfully into the distance
as I caress my own neck.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.519
- Ma'am, could I borrow you?
- Mm-hm.

41:25.232 --> 41:27.234
Is Mr. Wyler leaving?

41:31.071 --> 41:32.156
Yes.

41:34.116 --> 41:35.159
Um...

41:35.910 --> 41:36.994
Is he coming back?

41:39.955 --> 41:43.876
He will get me on my feet,
and then he will go.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.213
It is a two-person job.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.883
Mrs. Dursley can plan a menu
without the help of Hal Wyler.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.427
- Yes, but--
- The president asked me to do him a solid.

41:53.427 --> 41:57.097
At what point do you think I should have
raised the epic failure of my marriage?

41:57.097 --> 41:59.391
- Ma'am--
- This was fun, I feel like we're closer.

41:59.975 --> 42:01.769
I need to step away and change my shoes

42:01.769 --> 42:06.357
because Uma and Pippa think
I'll project more power in a block heel.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.403
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:13.572 --> 42:15.115
You're getting divorced.

42:16.408 --> 42:17.243
No, we're not.

42:17.243 --> 42:20.829
- Does the White House know?
- There's nothing to know.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.375
The ambassador says your--
Your marriage is over.

42:25.668 --> 42:26.752
Ever been married?

42:27.378 --> 42:29.964
This doesn't work
if she's getting divorced.

42:29.964 --> 42:33.509
You can't slot someone in the
vice presidency if she's getting divorced.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.802
She'll take me back.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.889
Okay. I gotta talk to Billie.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.724
You work it out with her
and the president--

42:40.724 --> 42:43.644
No. You don't tell anyone.
She will take me back.

42:44.436 --> 42:45.271
I...

42:46.814 --> 42:53.070
do things that make her want to leave me,
and I will not do them again.

42:53.862 --> 42:57.324
You were here two hours, made one call.
The secretary of state wants to fire her.

42:57.324 --> 43:00.744
I'm a big pain in the ass
but it doesn't work without me.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.204
Okay.

43:02.788 --> 43:06.709
Then tell her. If she wants it, fine,
but I am not sneaking around.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.461
I can't tell her, she'll blow it!

43:10.254 --> 43:14.800
She hates cameras
and microphones and people.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.428
Right now, she is cutting a fucking ulcer

43:17.428 --> 43:19.722
because she has to make nice
with a reporter.

43:19.722 --> 43:22.266
Then who the fuck thought
she should be vice president?

43:22.266 --> 43:23.767
She is the one you want.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.562
Not Grace Penn, not me.

43:26.562 --> 43:31.483
No one with the temperament to win a
campaign should be in charge of anything.

43:31.483 --> 43:35.112
It's the most obvious rule in the world.
No one who likes power should have it.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.115
You can't eliminate
every public-facing piece of the job.

43:38.115 --> 43:39.533
That's why we're here.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.828
In a land of hats.

43:42.828 --> 43:46.874
She is a frog in a pot of water.
We have six months.

43:46.874 --> 43:49.251
We can turn the heat up slowly,
and she won't jump out.

43:49.251 --> 43:51.879
But you can't tell her
you're boiling her alive.

43:52.838 --> 43:55.341
This metaphor gives me
a lot of confidence.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.468
Billie says you're good at this.

43:57.468 --> 44:01.680
And I'm good at this, which we all know,
despite the chaos which reigns around me.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.848
We can get her there.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.643
Not if she doesn't want it.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.311
Or you.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.272
Of course she wants me.
She fucking loves me.

44:11.857 --> 44:14.109
You can't think about it too hard.
It'll break your heart.

44:18.364 --> 44:21.742
Step away please, if we could,
while we have the light.

44:21.742 --> 44:22.993
Thank you.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.537
To me. That's nice.

44:25.537 --> 44:27.956
Moving on to the carriage now,
if you please.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.292
Thank you. I believe you have enough.

44:30.292 --> 44:32.461
Hey. Psst.

44:37.549 --> 44:38.884
They keep touching me.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.178
That's part of it.

44:42.054 --> 44:45.516
I scratched my face and picked a wedgie.
I think I have lipstick on my ass.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.768
- Nothing.
- Okay.

44:49.061 --> 44:49.895
Hey.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.233
You look incredible.

44:55.734 --> 44:57.111
Shall we go for a ride?

45:00.656 --> 45:03.033
Um... yeah.

45:03.742 --> 45:05.869
Mm-hm. Got it.

45:30.644 --> 45:31.645
Look at her.

45:34.648 --> 45:35.983
Just like a princess.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.326
Ambassador.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.717
If you put them back on and walk,
they might soften.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.719
I think it will break my pelvis.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.888
This feels small. Is it a bit small?

46:05.888 --> 46:08.056
- It's a bit roomy in the shoulders.
- Yeah.

46:08.056 --> 46:11.268
Why don't we get Jonathan to take us up
to the van and get the tailor.

46:11.268 --> 46:13.854
- Are my pants a little short?
- We'll take a look at that too.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.772
Okay. How are you doing?

46:16.982 --> 46:17.816
Thank you.

46:24.573 --> 46:25.699
May I fix your tie?

46:26.200 --> 46:28.744
- Yeah. I think I screwed up the knot.
- Okay.

46:31.914 --> 46:35.584
You're perfectly safe. This is very mild.
You'll be yourself in no time.
