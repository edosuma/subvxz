Why were you

07:31.201 --> 07:32.744

07:32.786 --> 07:34.121
Why were you

07:32.786 --> 07:34.121
sneaking around?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.790
Because I know

07:34.162 --> 07:36.790

You're always

Deej, look at him.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.089
He's the reason they

07:41.461 --> 07:44.089
invented restraining orders.

Fine.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.944

13:43.406 --> 13:46.200
I may be getting old

13:46.242 --> 13:47.786
but I'm still

13:46.242 --> 13:47.786
young enough to rock and roll.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.579
And there's no way that

13:47.826 --> 13:49.579
I'm getting up on that stage

13:49.621 --> 13:52.457
playing any silly stinking

13:49.621 --> 13:52.457
polkas, alright?

13:52.499 --> 13:55.126
And another thing, anybody

13:52.499 --> 13:55.126
caught dead in these outfits

13:55.168 --> 13:57.420
oughta be taken

13:55.168 --> 13:57.420
out in the back and..

14:00.340 --> 14:02.634
And-and-and

14:00.340 --> 14:02.634
given an-an award

14:02.676 --> 14:06.304
for their fine-fine

14:02.676 --> 14:06.304
sense of fashion.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.806
My, you look

14:06.346 --> 14:07.806
handsome today.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.766
[chuckles]

14:09.808 --> 14:12.727
Listen I-I would love

14:09.808 --> 14:12.727
to play a-a rousing rendition

14:12.769 --> 14:14.646
of a-of a

14:12.769 --> 14:14.646
hopping polka for you

14:14.688 --> 14:17.357
but gosh darn it,

14:14.688 --> 14:17.357
my tuba's out getting detailed.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.025
Oh!

14:19.066 --> 14:22.903
No problem. I have a room

14:19.066 --> 14:22.903
full of polka supplies.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.905
You're out of excuses, pal.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.284
Well, uh, I-I can

14:24.947 --> 14:28.284
help you out here, Jess.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.203
- Viper.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.203
- Hey, babe.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.663
I was hoping

14:30.244 --> 14:31.663
you'd be here.

14:32.831 --> 14:35.375
Hey, how are you gonna

14:32.831 --> 14:35.375
help, Goldilocks?

14:35.416 --> 14:39.379
- Well, I-I play a little polka.

14:35.416 --> 14:39.379
- Yeah?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.381
Yeah, my dad

14:39.420 --> 14:41.381
used to have a band

14:41.422 --> 14:44.425
um, Big Heinz

14:41.422 --> 14:44.425
and The Polka Dots.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.470
Wait a minute. Where you the kid

14:44.467 --> 14:47.470
with the little accordion?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.013
Yeah, that-that was me.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.432
Tiny Heinz.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.352
Really?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.436
You'd help me out

14:54.394 --> 14:55.436
even though

14:55.478 --> 14:57.146
I kicked you

14:55.478 --> 14:57.146
out of the band?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.232
Yeah.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.775
You're alright, Tiny.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.110
Uh, let's just

15:00.817 --> 15:03.110
stick with Viper.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.320
Right.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.573
Listen, guys,

15:04.362 --> 15:06.573
I'm, uh, I'm sorry

15:06.614 --> 15:09.992
I lost my head over this whole

15:06.614 --> 15:09.992
thing between you two.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.661
So preoccupied

15:10.034 --> 15:11.661
about getting old

15:11.703 --> 15:13.954
I forgot what

15:11.703 --> 15:13.954
it's like to be young.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.709
And...I'd love to have

15:15.415 --> 15:17.709
you back in the band.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.503
You got it.

15:20.545 --> 15:24.758
Well, well, well,

15:20.545 --> 15:24.758
I'm glad we're all happy now.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.468
But if we don't start to hear

15:24.799 --> 15:27.468
some oompah-pah soon

15:27.510 --> 15:29.262
this crowd's

15:27.510 --> 15:29.262
gonna turn ugly.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.098
I think

15:30.764 --> 15:32.098
it's already turning.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.435
Alright, I'm about

15:33.641 --> 15:35.435
to say somethin'

15:35.476 --> 15:37.311
I'm sure Elvis never said.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.522
Let's polka, baby.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.445
See, Deej?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.445
Everything worked out just fine.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.784
Uh...you might wanna

15:47.781 --> 15:50.784
hold that thought.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.832
Dad, we need to talk

15:55.622 --> 15:57.832
about me and Viper.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.964
Okay, you wanna talk

16:02.462 --> 16:04.964
to me about you and Viper?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.173
Let's talk.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.887
I'm listening.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.808
[sighs]

16:10.929 --> 16:14.808
Dad, I'm sorry

16:10.929 --> 16:14.808
I ran out like that.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.684
I can't tell you

16:14.849 --> 16:16.684
how much that hurt me, Deej.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.978
Well, I didn't

16:16.726 --> 16:18.978
do it to hurt you.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.814
I was frustrated.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.941
You weren't listening

16:20.855 --> 16:22.941
to anything I was saying.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.068
You just made your mind up

16:22.982 --> 16:26.068
about Viper and that was it.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.987
Look, I'm your father.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.072
Don't I have any say

16:28.028 --> 16:30.072
over who you go out with?

16:30.865 --> 16:32.784
No.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.577
It's not too late

16:32.826 --> 16:34.577
to change your answer.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.292
Dad, I love you,

16:37.246 --> 16:41.292
and I respect your opinion.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.545
But you have to respect the fact

16:41.334 --> 16:44.545
that who I date is up to me.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.047
I know that.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.091
And-and I do.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.762
I know I flip out sometimes.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.975
Truth is I-I do trust

16:54.054 --> 16:56.975
your judgment, D.J.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.478
Thanks, dad.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.478
That means a lot to me.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.363
But Viper?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.448
Dad, there's a lot of things

17:10.404 --> 17:12.448
you don't know about him.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.533
Yeah, like what?

17:13.574 --> 17:16.076
Like, he's

17:13.574 --> 17:16.076
a really decent guy.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.079
I mean, he wanted

17:16.118 --> 17:19.079
to tell you about us.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.040
He's sweet and caring.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.711
And looks really good

17:22.291 --> 17:24.711
