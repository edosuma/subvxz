00:31.965 --> 00:34.066
Inside this cage

00:34.134 --> 00:37.136
Is the most ferocious
animal on the planet.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.672
If it gets out, don't bother
calling for help.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.574
You won't have time.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.075
So if you value your life,

00:43.143 --> 00:45.511
You'll keep the cage locked.

00:45.579 --> 00:49.549
Never remove this lock.

00:49.616 --> 00:50.950
Any questions?

00:51.018 --> 00:53.352
Nope!

01:11.672 --> 01:13.206
Hey, mister,

01:13.273 --> 01:16.776
You forgot your lock!

01:47.641 --> 01:49.742
Sleep well?

01:49.809 --> 01:51.027
Why?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.529
Are you implying that I wet the bed?

01:54.865 --> 01:57.450
Uh, you get the paper,
I'm gonna get coffee.

01:57.501 --> 01:59.819
Are you implying that I don't know
how to make coffee?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.721
You don't know how to make coffee.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.006
Hmphh.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.329
Another boring day in the suburbs.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.546
Didn't you get the paper?
Do you know how

02:27.614 --> 02:29.315
To do anything around here?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.884
Don't open that! There's
a wild animal out there!

02:33.220 --> 02:34.954
It's a dog!

02:35.022 --> 02:36.822
That is no dog!

02:36.890 --> 02:39.558
It's a dog.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.527
Aw.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.362
Are you lost, poochie?

02:45.432 --> 02:47.767
Maybe he belongs
to one of our neighbors.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.604
He's a wild animal. He can't possibly
belong to one of our neighbors.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.590
Well, then maybe
we should keep him.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.343
But what if he belongs
to one of our neighbors?

02:59.513 --> 03:02.014
Ooh, hello.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.884
We're sorry to bother you,
but did you lose a pet?

03:06.586 --> 03:09.956
Lose a bet?
Oh, I don't gamble.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.092
I mean, I'll buy a lottery ticket
now and then.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.595
No, no, not a bet. A pet.

03:16.663 --> 03:19.432
We found this dog.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.834
Oh, you found my clog.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.102
Oh, thank goodness.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.138
I've been looking everywhere for it.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.174
Oh, brother.
Forget the clog.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.409
What she really needs
is a hearing aid.

03:30.477 --> 03:34.913
Cheering maid?
What's a cheering maid?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.248
You know, a cheering maid.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.551
It's basically a cheerleader who
cleans your house,

03:38.602 --> 03:41.437
They'll do the splits
to wax the floors,

03:41.521 --> 03:43.289
They use their pleated skirts
to clean the blinds.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.859
Not only do they do windows,
they do w-I-n-

03:46.927 --> 03:50.296
I thought I saw a tasmanian devil!

03:50.364 --> 03:52.531
Nice try, bird.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.333
I did!

03:54.401 --> 03:57.453
I did see a tasmanian devil!

03:57.537 --> 03:58.804
Yeoww!

04:12.986 --> 04:15.488
Ooh, whoa!

04:18.642 --> 04:20.159
Whoa!
Come on, lady!

04:20.226 --> 04:22.261
Cheering maids!

04:22.329 --> 04:26.599
They have names like cindy,
margie, britney, molly and britney.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.235
With their toothy little
smile and feather duster.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.936
What don't you understand?

04:31.004 --> 04:34.774
They're real energetic, their
pom poms are a set of sponges,

04:34.841 --> 04:38.577
Wait! Why are we still
talking about cheering maids?

04:38.645 --> 04:40.012
Is this your dog or not?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.114
Do I do the fox trot?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.183
Oh, why, yes, of course!

04:44.251 --> 04:47.053
Oh, yes!

04:49.623 --> 04:50.723
You know what?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.258
Let's just keep the mangy beast,

04:52.325 --> 04:54.593
Because I can't take another
second of this.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.262
You hear that, boy?

04:56.329 --> 04:58.864
You got a new home.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.084
Aah! Not my recliner!

05:18.151 --> 05:20.920
Aww. He must be hungry.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.573
You stay here and keep
an eye on poochie

05:24.658 --> 05:26.258
While I go get him some dog food.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.494
Say, now that I think about it,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.529
He's going to need a dog bowl, too.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.065
And a dog collar,
and a dog leash,

05:33.133 --> 05:35.267
And a dog bed.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.771
Oh, maybe a little dog sweater.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.041
All right, you filthy beast.
Drop it!

05:42.109 --> 05:45.544
Mother!

05:45.612 --> 05:47.880
Easy, boy. Easy.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.116
Sorry if the filthy beast remark
came off as a little harsh.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.184
I meant it as a compliment.

05:52.235 --> 05:54.320
You know, like,
"look at that filthy beast!

05:54.387 --> 05:56.522
I like to party with that guy!"

05:58.525 --> 06:00.793
Oh, come on.
You don't want to hurt me.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.112
I'm a sweet guy.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.747
Not sweet as in delicious.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.532
Just sweet as in my personality.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.535
Everyone who knows me says
I'm extremely tender.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.871
Ah, I mean, you know,
tender and nice.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.472
Not like my meat is tender.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.574
Although duck meat is one
of your more tender meats.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.977
Oh, no!
I've said too much!

06:19.679 --> 06:21.614
Yeoww!

06:21.681 --> 06:23.082
Ahhh!

06:23.150 --> 06:25.351
Animal control, there's a monster
in my house

06:25.418 --> 06:27.153
That's trying to kill me!

06:54.548 --> 06:55.998
What are you doing out here?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.833
You're supposed to be
watching poochie.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.920
Poochie is a psychotic monster!

07:00.987 --> 07:03.255
He hunted me like I was his prey!

07:03.323 --> 07:05.658
If you don't want to watch
the dog, just say so.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.760
You can't go in there.
It's a death sentence.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.645
We gotta sell the house,
start out new!

07:09.729 --> 07:12.231
This neighborhood's a bummer anyway!

07:12.299 --> 07:13.832
Wait!

07:13.900 --> 07:16.402
Since this is the last time
I'm ever going to see you alive,

07:16.469 --> 07:19.038
There's a few things
I need to tell you.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.707
Remember that time someone
ate all your Halloween candy

07:21.775 --> 07:23.709
And I said it must
have been aliens?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.844
It was me.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.647
And remember that time someone
ordered all those pay per view movies

07:28.715 --> 07:30.349
And I said it was aliens?

07:30.417 --> 07:32.184
That was me, too.

07:32.252 --> 07:36.655
And remember that time you were abducted
by aliens and I insisted it was me?

07:36.723 --> 07:39.525
I lied. It was aliens.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.335
Poochie, I'm home...

07:52.973 --> 07:55.007
A gruesome tragedy's
going to make it

07:55.075 --> 07:57.576
A lot harder to sell this house.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.917
Ah! My glamour shot!

08:05.986 --> 08:08.587
Ah! My tennis trophy!

08:08.654 --> 08:12.190
Ah! My glamour shot
of my tennis trophy!

08:12.258 --> 08:14.960
No!
Hey!

08:15.027 --> 08:16.728
What's going on out here?
We're trying to celebrate

08:16.796 --> 08:18.330
My niece's quinceañera.

08:18.397 --> 08:21.333
It's a special day
and you're ruining it.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.202
Now, please, señor bunny,
keep it down.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.543
What is that thing?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.145
He's my dog.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.546
Woof. If you say so.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.748
But that's one ugly dog.

08:36.816 --> 08:37.982
How did you do that?

08:38.049 --> 08:40.885
I simply asserted
my place as the alpha dog.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.256
Sit. See? He's calm,

08:44.323 --> 08:46.525
Because now he knows
I am not afraid of him.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.894
Down. Roll over.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.529
You see?

08:50.596 --> 08:52.531
You need to be the alpha dog to him.

08:52.598 --> 08:53.965
Alpha dog, huh?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.053
One disclaimer...
this stuff works on dogs.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.486
And...

08:58.554 --> 09:02.691
I'm still not convinced
that that's a dog.

09:02.758 --> 09:05.060
What is wrong with everyone?

09:05.127 --> 09:07.395
He's obviously a dog.

09:13.736 --> 09:16.037
Tchh.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.909
Good boy.

10:04.987 --> 10:07.622
Oh, a dog salon.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.957
You've been such a good boy today.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.359
You deserve a little pampering.

10:11.428 --> 10:16.231
Have you seen this animal?
He's very dangerous.

10:16.299 --> 10:20.335
If you see him,
call the zoo immediately.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.808
How may I help you?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.010
We'll take the puppy
pamper package, please.

10:28.077 --> 10:29.844
We're very busy.

10:29.912 --> 10:32.914
The worstminster dog show
is tonight. As you can see,

10:32.982 --> 10:35.684
Every dog who's any dog
is here getting ready.

10:37.286 --> 10:39.888
In that case,
maybe I should enter my dog.

10:39.957 --> 10:42.558
Well, if you're competing,
I can certainly squeeze you in...

10:42.625 --> 10:45.660
Oh, my! What is that?

10:45.728 --> 10:46.828
That's my dog.

10:48.397 --> 10:51.266
Sir, I hate to be
the bearer of obvious news,

10:51.334 --> 10:54.269
But that is not a dog.
Hmm?

10:54.337 --> 10:56.671
What did you just say?

10:56.739 --> 11:00.041
I said that thing is not a dog.

11:00.109 --> 11:02.844
Hmm?

11:09.852 --> 11:12.487
For your information,
that is a dog.

11:12.555 --> 11:14.889
He may not be the prettiest dog.

11:14.957 --> 11:17.859
He may not be the most refined dog.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.093
But my dog has something

11:19.145 --> 11:22.764
That no other dog in here has.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.168
And that is class.

11:33.876 --> 11:37.445
And I'll prove it to you.
Because my dog's going to win

11:37.513 --> 11:39.848
The worstminster dog show.

11:41.183 --> 11:45.487
And by the way,
your salon is a dump.

11:45.554 --> 11:48.823
Come on, poochie.
You want to win a trophy?

11:48.891 --> 11:53.328
Oh, what a cute doggie.

11:53.396 --> 11:55.463
Let me get a good look at you.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.500
I've never seen such a cute dog.

11:57.566 --> 12:00.769
What a good boy.

12:15.017 --> 12:18.420
Well, I can't think
of anything else

12:18.487 --> 12:19.988
To tell you.

12:20.056 --> 12:22.323
Have a good day!

12:28.097 --> 12:31.032
Oh, the excitement
is palpable here

12:31.101 --> 12:32.734
At the worstminster dog show.

12:32.803 --> 12:35.703
Pray tell, who do you think
is going to win?

12:35.771 --> 12:38.239
I think that one.
Oh, no, maybe that one.

12:38.308 --> 12:41.042
Oh, no, wait,
I didn't see that one.

12:41.111 --> 12:43.779
Oh, you do know there can
only be one winner, right?

12:43.846 --> 12:47.149
Well, I guess that's why
the excitement is so palpable!

12:47.216 --> 12:49.551
Oh, dear.

12:50.654 --> 12:51.887
I'm here for my mani-pedi.

12:51.955 --> 12:55.724
Sir, I've told you before...
this is a salon for dogs.

12:55.792 --> 12:58.960
Fine! I wouldn't be caught
dead in here anyway.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.029
Your salon is a dump.

13:01.097 --> 13:02.597
It's not our fault!

13:02.666 --> 13:05.167
Some rabbit came in here
with a wild beast

13:05.235 --> 13:08.670
Claiming he was going to enter
him in the worstminster dog show.

13:08.737 --> 13:10.605
Bugs.

13:10.673 --> 13:12.841
And people say I'm the crazy one.

13:17.813 --> 13:18.980
What a joke.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.783
I have a better chance
at winning a dog show

13:20.851 --> 13:22.685
Then that thing.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.988
Tasmanian devil? Danger?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.123
Savage killer?!

13:28.190 --> 13:30.726
I've got to warn bugs!

13:30.793 --> 13:33.629
Guitar lessons?!

13:33.697 --> 13:35.747
Ahh!

13:40.527 --> 13:44.030
I gotta warn bugs!

13:44.098 --> 13:46.833
I'm coming to save you, bugs!

13:46.900 --> 13:49.502
Ooh, hoo-hoo, oooh, oooh!

13:49.570 --> 13:52.138
Hey, souvenirs!

13:57.978 --> 13:59.579
Announcer on p.A.: Up next,

13:59.646 --> 14:02.982
Bugs bunny and his dog poochie.

14:03.917 --> 14:07.220
I'm coming to save you, bugs!

14:10.524 --> 14:11.474
Bugs!

14:11.558 --> 14:14.827
Bugs, look!

14:16.764 --> 14:18.865
You want me to take
guitar lessons?

14:18.932 --> 14:21.467
Not that! This.

14:21.518 --> 14:23.302
Poochie's not a dog!

14:23.370 --> 14:25.304
He's a tasmanian devil!

14:25.372 --> 14:27.740
What's a tasmanian devil?

14:27.808 --> 14:31.010
A wild beast whose
insatiable hunger

14:31.078 --> 14:32.678
For violence and destruction,

14:32.746 --> 14:35.481
Combined with his sharp
teeth and claws

14:35.549 --> 14:38.117
Make him the perfect
killing machine!

14:38.185 --> 14:40.787
Killing machine!

14:40.838 --> 14:42.755
Killing machine!

14:46.176 --> 14:48.161
Bugs bunny: Poochie!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.515
Poochie!

15:01.842 --> 15:04.944
Aaah! Over there!

15:09.583 --> 15:12.385
Run for your life!
Panic!

15:12.452 --> 15:13.920
Every man for himself!

15:13.987 --> 15:15.922
Women and children last!

15:16.890 --> 15:20.226
Aha! He's under here!

15:20.294 --> 15:21.627
What are you doing?!

15:21.695 --> 15:23.229
Saving your life.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.165
My life isn't in danger,
but now his is.

15:26.233 --> 15:29.502
But he's a wild animal.
He's a monster!

15:29.570 --> 15:31.204
Have you ever heard
the expression

15:31.271 --> 15:33.406
"don't judge a book by it's cover"?
No.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.842
What about, "it's what's inside
that counts." uh-uh.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.543
"looks can be deceiving".
Doesn't ring a bell.

15:37.611 --> 15:40.079
What's wrong with you?
Oh! That one I've heard.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.547
The point is,

15:41.598 --> 15:43.616
He may be a tasmanian devil,

15:43.684 --> 15:46.586
But he's also the best dog
I've ever had.

15:46.653 --> 15:49.522
Seal all the exits!

15:53.093 --> 15:56.395
I've gotta get him
out of here, but how?

15:56.463 --> 15:59.599
Put this on.

16:01.835 --> 16:02.935
Thanks, doc.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.704
Don't mention it.
I mean, I will.

16:04.771 --> 16:07.039
Whenever it benefits me.

16:11.011 --> 16:14.113
I'm a tasmanian devil!

16:14.181 --> 16:15.615
There he is, get him!

16:15.682 --> 16:17.116
Aahhh!

16:29.029 --> 16:32.531
Freeze!

16:36.136 --> 16:39.305
There's a dangerous animal in there.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.207
You make sure
you get him home safe.

16:41.275 --> 16:44.744
That's exactly what I plan on doing.

16:56.323 --> 16:57.523
Well, poochie,

16:57.591 --> 16:59.625
I guess this is it.

16:59.693 --> 17:01.193
I wish I could keep you,

17:01.261 --> 17:03.029
But this is where you belong.

17:03.096 --> 17:05.498
So long, buddy.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.609
Shh! Go.

17:17.678 --> 17:19.878
Oooh.

17:34.561 --> 17:36.162
Hmm.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.798
Oh! Do you have a dog?

17:38.865 --> 17:41.534
I used to.

17:44.638 --> 17:46.772
Poochie?

17:47.691 --> 17:50.943
Hang on, boy.
We're going home.

20:21.327 --> 20:23.829
Uh-oh!

20:30.837 --> 20:32.338
The call on the field

20:32.405 --> 20:33.739
Is illegal use of the hands and...

20:33.807 --> 20:36.842
Ah-ah-ahem! Beat it!

20:36.910 --> 20:38.644
...Put the ball
on the 44 yard line.

20:39.980 --> 20:42.681
Do not make me use this!

20:44.251 --> 20:46.085
Tshawww!

20:46.153 --> 20:48.487
Tchooyyy!

20:48.555 --> 20:51.056
Tchewww!

20:56.897 --> 20:59.798
I prefer the couch, anyway.
