00:11.594 --> 00:15.265

00:25.608 --> 00:28.695

00:30.572 --> 00:33.158

00:33.241 --> 00:36.453

00:51.468 --> 00:52.761

Just a few more steps, and...

01:15.533 --> 01:17.911
Ta-da!

01:17.994 --> 01:19.662
You dragged me 20 blocks
to show me a closed cookie shop?

01:19.746 --> 01:22.457
And the soon-to-be offices

01:22.540 --> 01:24.959
of the new
Lott Legal Action Firm.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.128
What? Are you joking?

01:27.212 --> 01:29.339
No, but what about
your corporate overlord?

01:29.422 --> 01:30.924
Will be getting my notice
at the end of week.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.467
Wow, you're actually doing it.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.303
I've always told you,
dreams don't come true
by themselves.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.137
You have to make them.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.639
And paying my dues
with the de Haans

01:37.722 --> 01:39.974
- made it possible.
- Yeah.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.643
Role modeling super hard
right now.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.812
(CHUCKLES)
About time I did that again.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.563
Very proud of you.
But I gotta say,

01:45.647 --> 01:46.981
I'm vaguely craving
a chocolate chip cookie
right now.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.652
Well, I'll keep
the cookie part open for you.

(GREYSON DE HAAN CHUCKLING)

02:07.710 --> 02:09.796
That bitch turned me
from a queen to a commoner

02:09.879 --> 02:12.507
in one day,
and you're happy about it?

02:12.590 --> 02:16.094
Maybe now you will focus
on your studies.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.929
I'm quite sure our little girl
will find a way to get herself

02:18.012 --> 02:21.140
back on top.
Isn't that right, kiddo?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.852
No. Mom's right.
Gossip Girl won.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.020
A de Haan never surrenders.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.523
I didn't surrender.
I was defeated.

02:30.108 --> 02:34.028
And de Haans do not claw
their way to the top.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.030
They get there on their own,
or they don't deserve to.

OBIE BERGMANN: Right there.
No, right there.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.132
That's the punch
that fractured my rib.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.925
That's not something
to joke about.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.051
OBIE: Come on,
it could've been a lot worse.

02:57.135 --> 03:01.681
How? Someone decided
it was more important

03:01.764 --> 03:05.602
to film your attack
than to help or call the cops,

03:05.685 --> 03:07.896
letting the monster
who attacked you go free.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.772
I'm sure the guy
was just in a bad way, you know.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.066
He probably needed some money.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.277
Congratulations.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.113
You officially have the body
to match that bleeding heart.

03:17.196 --> 03:20.742
The one person you cannot
have sympathy for is GG.

03:20.825 --> 03:23.119
She's created this world where
we've traded basic human decency

03:23.202 --> 03:27.957
for voyeuristic nihilism.
It's a whole new low.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.586
Well, maybe it's time
to just give up the GG vendetta.

03:31.669 --> 03:34.255
Right? I mean, she hasn't
been great for your friendships.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.216
If it wasn't for her,
Audrey and I would be fine.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.179
Once GG's taken out,
I can repair everything else.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.265
And once you're out of here,
I can nurse you back to health.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.809
How do you feel about healing
at the Greenwich this weekend?

03:46.893 --> 03:47.852
Perfect. Heidi's in town
this weekend.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.187
Book the North Moore penthouse?

03:50.813 --> 03:51.773
Okay.

03:51.856 --> 03:52.941
(GRUNTS)

03:53.024 --> 03:55.735
- Shit, sorry.
- Yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.903
- I'll see you later.
- OBIE: Yeah.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.280
You know where to find me.

JORDAN GLASSBERG: Our first walk
for coffee together.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.159
I mean, we've done it
a million times,

04:03.242 --> 04:04.452
but not as an "us."

04:04.535 --> 04:06.287
Speaking of, are we an "us"?

04:06.371 --> 04:09.248
- Am I saying "us" too much?
- Mm.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.834
Also, I'm thinking about
getting my nipples pierced

04:11.918 --> 04:13.628
or your face tattooed on my abs.

04:13.711 --> 04:14.963
Thoughts?

04:15.046 --> 04:17.298
Uh, yeah, that--
that sounds good.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.800
You haven't been listening
to a word I've said

04:18.883 --> 04:20.301
for the last ten minutes.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.637
But maybe I should be
more bothered by the fact

04:22.720 --> 04:25.306
that a child was beaten up
and you seem giddy.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.891
I'm not giddy he got hurt.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.227
I'm giddy because
we got international attention!

04:29.310 --> 04:30.603
Particularly in Germany.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.230
You're hoping Helena steps foot
onto US soil

04:32.313 --> 04:35.817
and Gossip Girl gets the credit
for her arrest.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.319
- Then what?
- Then the floodgates open!

04:38.403 --> 04:40.947
Every rich kid in Manhattan
slides into my DMs,

04:41.030 --> 04:42.198
exposing the sins
of their parents.

04:42.281 --> 04:46.035
Dozens of Madoffs
made off with in a month,

04:46.119 --> 04:47.996
freeing up a whole generation
to be multitudes better

04:48.079 --> 04:50.164
than the ones that came
before it.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.166
Is this maybe going
to your head a little bit?

04:52.917 --> 04:53.918
Shouldn't it be?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.796
Once Gossip Girl
starts targeting

04:56.879 --> 04:59.298
the top one percent
of the one percent,

04:59.382 --> 05:00.466
it's only a matter of time
before--

05:00.550 --> 05:03.386
They target me right back?
Is that what you're afraid of?

05:03.469 --> 05:05.179
You don't think they're gonna
use their endless money

05:05.263 --> 05:07.598
- and power to find you?
- Let's say you're right.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.435
That Gossip Girl
entering more dangerous waters

05:10.518 --> 05:12.270
develops an expiration date.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.480
How soon do we think
we have? A year?

05:14.564 --> 05:16.315
Billionaires will be after you.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.026
You'd be lucky
to survive a week.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.819
It'll take me a week
just to read all the DMs

05:19.902 --> 05:22.196
we get after this.
We agreed on a month.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.032
After that, we renegotiate.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.367
It won't be
open for negotiation!

05:26.451 --> 05:28.870
It'll be open season
on your identity.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.499
Maybe you could dodge it
for a month.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.501
And I'll help you do
whatever you need to do

05:35.585 --> 05:37.712
during that time,
no questions asked.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.222
Looks like my mom has really
taken to equine therapy.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.350
She said it's inspiring her
to sketch again.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.143
Don't mention that to your dad

05:52.226 --> 05:54.771
or Messica will drop
a line of chaps

05:54.854 --> 05:55.855
before Keeks is out of rehab.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.440
Do not worry about that.
With GG's help,

05:57.523 --> 05:59.484
I will have both
of their reputations destroyed

05:59.567 --> 06:00.443
by the time
my mom hits step nine.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.279
The way your mind works
is truly terrifying.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.115
But I also love it.

MAX WOLFE: Oh, hey,
th-- there's, uh, Luna.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.996
I pro-- I promised her
that I would, uh,

06:12.080 --> 06:14.290
I'd help her with, um...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.460
(CHUCKLES) I'll see--
I'll see you guys later.

about the eight-letter elephant

06:23.883 --> 06:25.009
in the room.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.928
LUNA LA:
Why would you say it first?

06:27.011 --> 06:28.763
You know better.
You never say it first!

06:28.846 --> 06:30.389
Yes, it was in the heat
of the moment.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.141
I was in a really good mood,
and it just-- you know, I...

06:32.225 --> 06:34.143
It just slipped out.
But still...

06:34.227 --> 06:35.478
Why didn't we say it back?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.980
I just wasn't expecting it.
It was a surprise.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.190
It did come out of nowhere.
But are we even sure it wasn't--

06:39.273 --> 06:43.277
- Total accident.
- So, you didn't mean it?

06:43.361 --> 06:45.113
How do you know
if you mean it, you know?

06:45.196 --> 06:46.239
Because I've-- I've never...

06:46.322 --> 06:47.323
...been in a relationship

06:47.406 --> 06:49.200
for longer than three days
before us.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.160
I mean, if he meant it,
it's kind of a big deal.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.704
And that we didn't
reciprocate is...

06:53.788 --> 06:54.997
...humiliating.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.500
Is it possible that you said it
because you do love them?

06:59.168 --> 07:00.586
Then the only question
left is...

07:00.670 --> 07:01.796
...why we didn't say it back?

07:01.879 --> 07:03.631
He did pretend
like he didn't say it,

07:03.714 --> 07:05.466
so why don't we do the same?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.011
Yeah, you're right.
I need to tell them the truth.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.556
I need to tell them
that I actually meant it.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.100
(INHALES DEEPLY)

07:14.183 --> 07:16.769
(EXHALES) You're so right.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.896
Knowing Max,
we'll never hear about it again.

we need to destroy Gossip Girl.

- Z, we can't give up.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.132
We just need a new plan.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.675
I know we couldn't convince
people to unfollow GG,

07:47.758 --> 07:49.802
but maybe...

07:49.886 --> 07:51.053
What if we made
a competing account

07:51.137 --> 07:53.181
that stole all her followers?

07:53.264 --> 07:55.725
Like Whisper Sister
or Rumor Bro.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.895
Jules, listen to me.
There is no "we" in this.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.354
This is your mission, not mine.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.106
My dad is trying
to launch his own firm,

08:02.190 --> 08:04.442
and I can't risk provoking her
and having it blow back on him.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.860

I wish everyone could see
that I'm just trying

08:17.371 --> 08:20.082
to make things right
for everyone.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.042
Audrey especially.

eye contact with me.

there's some throuple trouble.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.427

with Aki?

08:31.510 --> 08:34.805
No. Max.
What's going on with Aki?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.683
- Uh, what's up with Max?
- Not to be repeated, okay?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.185
But he dropped the L-bomb

08:39.268 --> 08:41.896
and received radio silence
in return.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.690
Ouch. Is he okay?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.817
He's in love.
I'm sure they are, too.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.320
They just need time
to figure out their feelings.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.239

blows them up first.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.938
Well, it is all my fault, so...
