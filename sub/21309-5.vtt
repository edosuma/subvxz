00:00.635 --> 00:02.570
Previously on The Strain...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.806
Stop it! Stop! Setrakian!

00:04.839 --> 00:07.175
- At least in here I can
pretend things are normal.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.610
- Not for me it isn't.

00:09.644 --> 00:14.215
(alarm blaring)
(indistinct shouting)

00:17.551 --> 00:19.788
(baby crying)

00:19.821 --> 00:22.156
(snarling)

00:22.190 --> 00:26.294
- This is a Whiskey 8-5-Mod-4
variable-yield nuclear warhead.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.362
It's missing the pit assembly.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.766
- That muncher convoy we saw.
Maybe that's what

00:31.800 --> 00:34.135
they were doing.
We gotta find that convoy.

00:34.168 --> 00:38.106
- "Join The Partnership."
- New Horizons.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.108
It was on the wall
in the transportation office.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.010
- And the train schedule, too.
They've been shipping people

00:42.043 --> 00:45.013
out of the city.
- Where?

00:45.046 --> 00:47.128
- I don't know. But I
can tell you one thing.

00:47.153 --> 00:49.007
I bet it doesn't look
exactly like this.

01:02.831 --> 01:04.799
(engine stalling)
(Ephraim): Come on.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.835
(engine sputtering)

01:09.537 --> 01:11.539
Shit.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.609
(birds chirping)

01:20.614 --> 01:23.651
Well, there's a town...
just south of here.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.487
Might be able to get a car

01:26.520 --> 01:28.622
or at least
siphon off some gas.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.645
- Where is everyone?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.888
(both chuckling)

01:59.921 --> 02:02.390
- Yeah, I guess we're both
a little on edge.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.292
- Yeah.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.596
What's so wrong
about this place?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.200
- I don't know.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.668
Doesn't look like
anybody put up a fight.

02:26.781 --> 02:29.083
Huh.

02:29.117 --> 02:31.152
No signal but there's some...

02:31.185 --> 02:33.354
juice in the battery.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.658
- You looking for something
in particular or...

02:37.691 --> 02:39.894
just being a creep?

02:39.928 --> 02:42.997
- Maybe a clue to figure out
what happened around here.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.310
- Hi, I'm Emily Stevens,
and this is my vlog.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.480
I have enough
peanut butter and...

02:59.513 --> 03:01.749
tuna for, like,
a really long time.

03:01.782 --> 03:06.687
I don't care if Dad traded
for a cool new suitcase;

03:06.720 --> 03:08.689
I'm not going.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.691
- That was dated two weeks ago.
Go to the one

03:10.724 --> 03:13.361
from the day prior.
- I don't get

03:13.394 --> 03:15.964
why mom and dad are so excited
to go to New Horizons.

03:15.997 --> 03:18.032
I just finished
decorating my room.

03:18.066 --> 03:21.535
They can do what they want...
but I'm not going.

03:21.569 --> 03:25.840
Fortunately, the workers
never finished my closet.

03:27.842 --> 03:29.810
Dad has no idea.

03:29.844 --> 03:32.646
- Maybe she's still here?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.885
- Emily!

03:36.918 --> 03:38.887
- Yeah?

03:38.920 --> 03:41.555
- It's almost curfew.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.358
Come inside and pack.
- Well Dad, I don't wanna go.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.895
- I promise you're gonna
love the new place.

03:46.928 --> 03:48.897
We're gonna have a garden,

03:48.930 --> 03:50.999
you'll be able to play outside
whenever you want.

03:51.032 --> 03:53.935
Doesn't that sound nice?
- Not really.

03:59.207 --> 04:01.109
- This is her house.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.393
Emily?

04:19.427 --> 04:21.896
- You worried about strigoi?

04:21.930 --> 04:24.198
- I'm worried about
a strigoi Emily.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.877
Must have gone

05:09.910 --> 05:11.879
- You think?
-Well...

05:11.912 --> 05:14.082
I don't see any cool
new suitcase around here.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.792
- You coming to bed?

05:26.794 --> 05:29.097
- Oh, um...

05:29.130 --> 05:33.301
I could probably
hit a couch.

05:35.303 --> 05:37.271
- Didn't mean it like that.

05:37.305 --> 05:40.141
The safest thing for us to do
is to be together.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.678
I promise I won't
take advantage of you,

05:44.712 --> 05:46.847
Dr. Goodweather.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.750
- No, it's not like that.
Normally I'd let you...

05:49.783 --> 05:53.287
I-I'm just trying to be a...
a different person...

05:53.321 --> 05:54.622

05:54.655 --> 05:57.191
so we can go to sleep?

- (Roman): Every time we get to
a silo, these assholes beat us.

07:30.551 --> 07:34.222
We're running out
of silos to hit. We can't win.

07:34.255 --> 07:37.291
- They'll be outta here soon.

- What the hell is that thing?

07:41.762 --> 07:44.398
(snarling)

07:44.432 --> 07:47.468
- A mongrel.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.803
The Master's mongrels
were baked on loam

07:49.837 --> 07:53.073
and anointed with a worm
exchange over two full moons.

07:53.107 --> 07:56.144
- Obviously.

07:56.177 --> 07:59.046
- A frontal assault at this
point would decimate our ranks.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.216
- You might be right.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.252
With these munchers
and mongrels,

08:04.285 --> 08:06.254
and all those collaborators...

08:06.287 --> 08:09.056
hitting them now
would be suicidal.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.293
- Finally, we agree
on something.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.828
- Yeah. We're gonna
have to take 'em on the move.

08:19.267 --> 08:21.235
So, they're clearly

08:21.269 --> 08:23.504
taking the pits south
on Route 5, but where?

08:23.537 --> 08:25.973
Might be going
to the salt mine down state

08:26.006 --> 08:29.243
to dispose of 'em?
- If we want to turn our nuke

08:29.277 --> 08:32.413
into a functioning one,
we're gonna have to steal a pit.

08:32.446 --> 08:34.415
- From that convoy?
I don't think so.

08:34.448 --> 08:38.286
- Come on Ben, we can handle it.
- The only thing we're getting

08:38.319 --> 08:40.521
from this shit show
is our asses handed to us.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.623

Rob Zombie nervous.

- Quinlan can't even
take care of himself right now.

our blood.

Hey.

a thousand years.

that working out for you?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.990

You don't like people,

09:19.927 --> 09:22.230
and most of them don't
wanna share a beer with you.

09:22.263 --> 09:24.565
But what you're
doing right now is stupid.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.000
All right? And you're only doing
it because you're rattled.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.238
You almost died in that silo
but I got you out.

09:30.271 --> 09:32.573
So don't fight me,
work with me,

09:37.945 --> 09:40.981
- What changed their minds?
- I did. I told them

09:41.014 --> 09:43.384
they could have all the silver
in the back of that truck.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.655
- I didn't see any silver.
- Yeah. Well, neither did I,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.057

11:04.097 --> 11:06.334
Has there been any word yet?

11:06.367 --> 11:09.470
- I have seen no one
of the type you search for.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.272
Not here, not ever.

11:12.306 --> 11:14.274
Go.

Abandon your quest,

Please. Sit.

13:37.350 --> 13:41.755
I had so hoped we could have

Your blood type is incredibly...

14:06.113 --> 14:08.448
desirable.

But, much like veal...

14:35.142 --> 14:37.611
charade?

14:37.645 --> 14:40.147

14:40.180 --> 14:43.551
You haven't eaten in days.
- Not the meal.

14:43.584 --> 14:45.553
The makeup,

14:45.586 --> 14:48.922
the suits,
the bullshit civility.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.126
You've won.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.229
You can be
like your own kind now.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.266
- No.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.070
I'm different.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.072
I'm special.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.176
Apart from all the others,
the Master blessed with me

15:09.209 --> 15:12.312
with free will.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.915
He entrusted me

15:14.948 --> 15:18.185
with implementing his vision
of this world.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.688
- What do you want from me?

15:20.721 --> 15:23.256
- Abraham Setrakian.

15:23.290 --> 15:27.094
Perhaps you can
tell me his whereabouts

15:27.127 --> 15:30.330
while you enjoy your meal...

15:30.363 --> 15:33.066
or I can make a meal of you.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.969
Then the Master
will know everything.

15:40.574 --> 15:42.576
(giggles)

15:44.578 --> 15:48.281
- Your minions separated us

15:48.315 --> 15:50.283
when they brought us in.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.854
I'm sure Setrakian
has been drained

15:53.887 --> 15:55.856
and discarded by now.

15:55.889 --> 16:00.427
The very... system
that you created

16:00.460 --> 16:02.730
has robbed you

16:02.763 --> 16:05.365
of your greatest victory.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.969
You will never
have the satisfaction

16:09.002 --> 16:11.939
of lording your big win
over him.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.246
(door opens)

16:19.279 --> 16:21.815
- Mr. Desai, check your records.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.554
An old man between the ages
of 70 and 100 had been processed

16:27.587 --> 16:30.490
the same day she was.
What happened to him?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.926
- Right away, Mr. Eichhorst.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.664
All right, I have, um,
four B positive men

16:36.697 --> 16:39.232
in his age range
that were processed that day.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.234
- Is one of them Setrakian?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.270
- Um...
- Is he alive?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.105
- Okay, two of them were
drained, one of them died

16:45.138 --> 16:49.076
of pneumonia three weeks prior.
- And the last one?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.679
- Last one's in
a bone marrow experiment.

16:53.781 --> 16:56.650
- Where is he?
- Um...

16:56.684 --> 16:58.786
- Research Wing Seven.

16:58.819 --> 17:01.154
- Seven.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.323
I'll check for myself.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.828
- Mr. Eichhorst?

17:07.861 --> 17:11.331
What about her?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.034
- Hold her until I verify
it's Setrakian.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.870
Then...

17:16.904 --> 17:19.206
drain her.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.649
- We're-we're actually
in the middle of an experiment

17:29.683 --> 17:31.551
on geriatric patients
to-to expand

17:31.584 --> 17:34.554
their viable
blood production lifespan.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.824
- I'm not interested
in your experiments!

17:36.857 --> 17:40.493
I'm looking for this old man
with a tattoo:

17:40.527 --> 17:43.330
A230385.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.332
- I-I know the exact person
you're looking for...

17:45.365 --> 17:48.301
- Where is he?
- He, uh, he's, uh... right...

17:48.335 --> 17:50.370
here.

17:56.844 --> 17:59.412
- (woman): Nurse?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.285
Nurse?

18:10.523 --> 18:14.394
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

18:14.427 --> 18:16.696
- Wake him.

18:16.730 --> 18:19.199
Now.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.068
- Bone marrow extraction's
incredibly painful

18:21.101 --> 18:22.870
and he's been heavily sedated.

18:22.903 --> 18:25.505
A regimen of amphetamines would
be too stressful for his heart.

18:25.538 --> 18:29.242
I mean, it could kill him.
- Either you wake him right now,

18:29.276 --> 18:33.246
or I will make sure
the next test subject will be...

18:33.280 --> 18:36.116
Dr. Joseph Himoff.

18:36.149 --> 18:39.219
- N-Nurse Cohen, 600 milligrams
of Dextroamphetamine, please.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.760
- Quinlan,

18:46.794 --> 18:48.361
you in position?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.430
- Yes.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.966
The same position
I was in 30 minutes ago.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.035
- We've spotted the convoy.

18:55.068 --> 18:58.171
It's headed your way.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.310
(indistinct conversations)

19:12.319 --> 19:13.453
- No.

19:22.029 --> 19:24.064
- Do I sit here with a demon?

19:24.097 --> 19:27.234
- Were you not sent by one?
By the Master?

19:27.267 --> 19:30.770
- No. My brother.

19:37.845 --> 19:41.081
- Your brother sends you
looking for demons?

19:41.114 --> 19:44.617
- He seeks your gift...
immortality.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.988
He lies near death,
beyond the help of medicine.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.923
His curiosity
about the dark arts

19:49.957 --> 19:51.825
revealed your secrets to him.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.527
He begged me to find someone
from your exotic order.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.664
- My "order" is not one
I'd wish any soul to join.

20:01.969 --> 20:03.937
- If...

20:03.971 --> 20:06.373
money or property
is of no allure to you...

20:13.546 --> 20:16.583
- You'd do this
for your brother?

20:18.585 --> 20:21.188
- Please. He suffers so.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.623
- I am indeed a demon,

20:23.656 --> 20:26.126
but my curse is my own.
I have no gift,

20:26.159 --> 20:28.461
dark or light, to give.

20:28.495 --> 20:32.699
- I beseech you.
Visit my brother,

20:32.732 --> 20:35.702
if only to confirm
his belief in the fantastic.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.377
(coughing)

20:44.411 --> 20:47.114
- Louisa, darling?
(sighing)

20:50.517 --> 20:53.320
Who is with you?

20:53.353 --> 20:55.422
- Someone...

20:55.455 --> 20:57.590
fantastic.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.931
- A strix.

21:05.398 --> 21:09.569
The immortal race?
The lore is true.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.672
Oh, beautiful fiend,
show me your teeth.

21:12.705 --> 21:16.576
I want to know forever.
I want to know deliverance!

21:24.151 --> 21:26.619
- Syphilis.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.756
The great pox.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.759
- For a time
I covered the guilty rash

21:32.792 --> 21:36.596
and became quite artful
with stage makeup,

21:36.629 --> 21:38.631
but now...

21:43.170 --> 21:45.472
...now it has his mind.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.640
- Release him.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.443
A draught of laudanum
from Hu Die.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.645
- I can't.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.983
Losing my twin
is like losing half myself.

21:56.016 --> 21:58.952
I don't want to live
without him.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.920
Are there any others
of your kind who might...

22:00.954 --> 22:03.623
- There are no others
in all of London Town.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.658
Of that I'm certain.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.996
- Mother!

22:11.298 --> 22:13.233
- Child, what is it?

22:13.266 --> 22:15.168
- I had a bad dream, mother.

22:15.202 --> 22:18.305
I thought I saw a monster.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.340
- Welcome Mister...

22:23.110 --> 22:26.346
- Quinlan.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.616
- Welcome Mr. Quinlan
to our home like a proper lady.

22:45.298 --> 22:46.699
- How long you been up here?

22:46.733 --> 22:48.701
- Lie down. Look at this.

22:56.009 --> 22:58.878
(chuckling)

22:58.911 --> 23:02.349
I haven't seen stars
in nine months.

23:04.584 --> 23:07.454
- Couldn't sleep?

23:07.487 --> 23:09.689
Yeah. Me, too.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.495
- You ever wonder what life
would have been like

23:15.528 --> 23:17.730
if this never happened?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.502
- I try not to.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.707
- I always thought I'd
move out of Philly one day.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.976
Get a house like this.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.812
Live the American dream.

23:32.845 --> 23:36.516
- Yeah, I wasn't really cut out
for suburban bliss.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.486
- You know what I mean.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.021
No matter how you might have
felt about your old life...

23:44.023 --> 23:47.660
...it was better than this.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.430
(door opens in distance)

24:01.874 --> 24:03.876
♪♪♪

24:24.297 --> 24:26.833
- Slide me that weapon.

24:37.144 --> 24:39.912
Want to lock the door,
sweetheart?

24:46.986 --> 24:49.256
What are you two doing here?

24:49.289 --> 24:51.791
- Just taking shelter
for the night.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.826
- You know they send
strigoi enforcers through here

24:53.860 --> 24:56.396
every couple days.
Better be careful.

24:56.429 --> 24:59.932
- Thanks for the advice.
Do you mind lowering the rifle?

24:59.966 --> 25:02.302
- Sorry about that.

25:04.304 --> 25:06.973
- It's all right.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.510
- We understand.
You're... scared.

25:10.543 --> 25:13.446
- I'm running out of time.
- We're still in this.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.915
If we work together,
we can turn it around.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.285
- No. Me?

25:21.954 --> 25:23.956
I'm done.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.025
Look at me.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.195
- You're turning.

25:28.228 --> 25:31.198
- Goddamn monsters.

25:31.231 --> 25:33.933
It's just my luck.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.135
I escaped from
that New Horizons,

25:36.169 --> 25:38.771
then this happens.

25:38.805 --> 25:41.341
- You escaped?
From New Horizons?

25:41.374 --> 25:44.344
- They sold us all
a bill of goods.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.779
Told us we weren't gonna
have to worry about rations

25:46.813 --> 25:48.781
and curfew anymore.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.384
We were gonna start
a farming community.

25:51.418 --> 25:53.953
I got to that Welcome Center...

25:53.986 --> 25:58.291
I just got a weird feeling.

25:58.325 --> 26:01.694
Saw a delivery truck leaving,
hid in the back.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.297
Figured I had enough in cans
to last a while...

26:04.331 --> 26:06.399
and I'd scavenge the rest.

26:06.433 --> 26:09.135
- So you didn't actually see
the farming community?

26:09.168 --> 26:11.371
- I didn't want to.

26:11.404 --> 26:14.374
That truck pulled out,
I rolled out the back,

26:14.407 --> 26:16.876
took the back roads to here.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.646
Been hiding out ever since.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.581
- Could you find it again
if you had to?

26:21.614 --> 26:23.650
- I guess but I don't want to.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.818
- This is important. I need to
understand what they're doing.

26:25.852 --> 26:29.756
If I can,
maybe we can beat them.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.577
(groaning)

27:03.290 --> 27:05.325
(yells)

27:07.827 --> 27:11.931
- (chuckles)

27:11.964 --> 27:15.602
A230385.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.239
Welcome back.

27:20.273 --> 27:23.476
- Rather...

27:23.510 --> 27:26.779
an imaginary snake attack me

27:26.813 --> 27:31.384
than see your face, Eichhorst.
- (laughing)

27:31.418 --> 27:34.821
- Where am I, exactly?

27:34.854 --> 27:38.425
- Don't you know?

27:38.458 --> 27:42.128
This... is the end.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.064
- Of what?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.600
- Of everything.

27:47.634 --> 27:50.269
Of our decades-long conflict.

27:50.303 --> 27:52.972
Of Abraham Setrakian.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.809
- Even on my deathbed,

27:56.843 --> 28:00.012
your pettiness
is nothing more

28:00.046 --> 28:02.281
than an annoyance.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.517
- Oh, don't you worry.

28:04.551 --> 28:06.353
You're not going to die.

28:06.386 --> 28:08.355
Not yet.

28:08.388 --> 28:10.357
First,

28:10.390 --> 28:13.426
I need you to do
something for me.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.995
Then, and only then,

28:16.028 --> 28:19.198
will I allow you to pass.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.936
- I will do nothing for you.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.272
(grunting)

28:26.305 --> 28:28.541
(laughing)
- But what I ask

28:28.575 --> 28:31.043
is so simple

28:31.077 --> 28:34.246
and will ensure
your suffering is brief.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.554
I just need you

28:41.588 --> 28:45.358
to admit one thing:

28:45.392 --> 28:48.060
that your God

28:48.094 --> 28:50.830
does not exist.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.002
- For your sake,

28:56.035 --> 28:59.539
you should hope
that he does not.

28:59.572 --> 29:03.075
- Oh, Abraham,
I know he doesn't.

29:03.109 --> 29:07.480
I just need
to hear you say it.

29:07.514 --> 29:10.182
- I'll see you...

29:10.216 --> 29:13.052
in hell, Eichhorst.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.123
- Yes.

29:21.961 --> 29:26.232
But you are already there.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.568
(whimpering)

29:28.601 --> 29:33.072
- You are the lucky ones.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.443
The shaving
is just the first step

29:36.476 --> 29:39.846
in a new radiation inoculation,
which will help

29:39.879 --> 29:41.748
with the potential side effects
from the Illumination.

29:44.484 --> 29:46.385
What's this?

29:46.419 --> 29:48.387
- She's priority,

29:48.421 --> 29:50.389
per Mr. Desai.

29:50.423 --> 29:52.492
- Thank you. This batch is all
being processed this morning.

29:54.494 --> 29:58.397
- You okay?

29:58.431 --> 30:00.500
- All right, Curly,
you're up.

30:02.569 --> 30:04.637
- Take a seat.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.547
Eyes down. Be still.

30:14.581 --> 30:18.618
- This is all a lie!
- Hey, shut up!

30:18.651 --> 30:22.221
- You're all about to be murdered!
Drained of your blood!

30:22.254 --> 30:24.090
Just like the babies that
they are draining in here!

30:24.123 --> 30:26.125
Our babies!
- Sit down!

30:26.158 --> 30:28.394
- That's what they're
counting on.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.630
That we will willingly
go to the slaughter!

30:30.663 --> 30:33.299
- Come on!
- Restrain her! Now

30:33.332 --> 30:37.970
Guards! Guards!

Control yourselves!
Control yourselves!

30:44.811 --> 30:47.379

30:50.883 --> 30:53.152
- Get the others out of here.
- What about you?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.488
- My friend might be alive.
If he is,

30:55.522 --> 30:58.791
I have to help him.

30:58.825 --> 31:00.893

We've gotta go!

31:09.001 --> 31:11.137
Come on!

31:28.020 --> 31:30.022
(alarm continuing)

31:40.266 --> 31:42.268
- Professor?

31:51.911 --> 31:53.980
Professor.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.215
- Ms. Velders,

31:56.248 --> 31:59.418
how... are you?

31:59.451 --> 32:01.588
- I'm better
now I've found you.

32:04.891 --> 32:07.359
- How touching.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.500
I'm sorry to say
that your reunion will be short.

32:14.533 --> 32:18.004
(chuckling)

32:18.037 --> 32:21.207
What can you
possibly do with that?

32:22.942 --> 32:24.744
(screaming)

32:33.485 --> 32:36.288
- Watch out!
- Get 'em!

32:57.076 --> 32:58.077
- Run him over!

(grunting)

33:09.588 --> 33:12.124
(honks)

33:21.033 --> 33:22.635

He's on the trailer now.

35:03.736 --> 35:05.704
Resist the temptation

35:05.738 --> 35:08.274
into the fact
that I saved you.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.577
Again.
- I will.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.348
- We better hurry.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.351
Reinforcements
will be on the way.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.854
- Yeah, and I'd bet my bed roll

35:21.888 --> 35:25.124
that there's a tracking device
on this truck.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.933

let's get that silver and

get the hell outta here.

35:35.301 --> 35:38.871

35:38.905 --> 35:41.140
- I, uh, might
have stretched the truth

35:41.173 --> 35:44.076
about exactly how much silver
we saw being loaded

35:44.110 --> 35:46.578
into the truck.
- How much did you see?

35:46.612 --> 35:49.148
- Approximately?

35:51.117 --> 35:54.821
None.
- What? Hold on.

35:54.854 --> 35:57.056
Oh, come on!

35:57.089 --> 35:59.658
You're telling me we risked
our lives taking this convoy

35:59.691 --> 36:02.094
so that you could get plutonium
and we could get nothing?

36:02.128 --> 36:04.063
- I wouldn't say "nothing."

36:04.096 --> 36:07.033
You have our undying gratitude.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.307
- I'm guessing The Partnership
will do better.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.309
In fact, I'm fairly certain
they'll pay a pretty penny

36:17.343 --> 36:20.346

No other munchers in here.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.598

- We've gotta get the pit

Come on!

37:04.924 --> 37:06.893

that's all that matters.
