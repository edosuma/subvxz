WEBVTT

00:16.760 --> 00:18.560
I love you.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.600
With all my heart.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.480
Six years ago,
we set out on our road trip.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.120
Ready, Rubes?

00:32.120 --> 00:33.600
- Yep.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.520
One life ended
and another began.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.960
No firm plans,
off into the great unknown.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.040
- Bye!
- See ya.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.840
Bye!

00:55.960 --> 00:58.720
Our much-loved green van

00:58.720 --> 01:01.880
unfortunately didn't
last the distance.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.200
But we weren't about to stop.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.040
Before we knew it, we'd been
on the road for four years.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.000
We'd move, settle for a bit,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.640
back to Sydney for visits,
head off again.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.920
Life had a rhythm.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.880
I spy, with my little eye,
something beginning with..."F."

01:24.880 --> 01:26.720
Lame, Mum.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.720
It wasn't lame yesterday.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.520
It's been lame for a long time.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.120
It was "foliage."

01:34.120 --> 01:36.080
"F" usually is.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.080
- Whoa!

01:42.080 --> 01:43.440
What's...

01:44.640 --> 01:47.240
But it couldn't
go on forever.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.320
Or for "flat."

01:51.880 --> 01:54.240
Who knows where we might
have put down roots

01:54.240 --> 01:56.200
if we hadn't blown that tire.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.960
- I can do it.
- It's too dangerous.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.560
- Dave, it's on a slope.
- It's fine.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.600
- I'm not a kid, Dad.
- Next time.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.600
You said that last time. He
did, right?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.920
You'll have plenty of chances
when you're older.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.400
What if we stop moving?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.600
Why don't you go
and tell me what that sign says?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.840
Yeah, good idea.
Let's go check out where we are.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.400
I'm not stupid. It's called
a diversionary tactic.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.440
It'd better be next time.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.000
Come on.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.080
Diversionary tactic?

02:31.080 --> 02:33.880
Every family
has its old soul.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.400
Ruby is ours.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.760
Maybe it's being
a late-life baby.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.520
Come on, grumpy.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.240
Maybe the years on the
road or maybe it's just her.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.560
Buradeena.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.880
Buradeena, Dave!

02:52.880 --> 02:54.760
Buradeena!

02:54.760 --> 02:56.160
Never heard of it!

02:57.160 --> 02:59.400
- Dave!
- Dad!

03:02.000 --> 03:04.960
We changed a lot of
tires along the way

03:04.960 --> 03:07.120
but this was a broken axle.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.120
Still, every cloud, as they say...

03:12.120 --> 03:14.120
Our silver lining.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.880
While we waited
for repairs,

03:22.880 --> 03:25.080
we fell in love
with Buradeena.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.200
Amazing.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.160
There's, like, three ice
cream places in this spot.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.640
In the blink of an eye,
we found our new home.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.520
Oh!

03:41.520 --> 03:43.160
I'm too old for this.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.480
I was a bit lighter
last time we did it.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.120
We found peace here.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.840
Quiet.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.200
Sometimes.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.440
Dave found
motocross...

04:08.440 --> 04:09.600
Whoo!

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
..a mate...

04:10.600 --> 04:13.040
Whoo-bloody-hoo!

04:13.920 --> 04:15.760
Ah, will you look at that?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.560
..and we found a lodger.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.720
Was the cake lady there?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.320
No. But the
broccoli boys were.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.680
Haha! Your lucky day.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.920
The perfect tenant
for our garden flat

04:25.920 --> 04:28.200
and the best apprentice
Dave's ever had.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.160
- Yuck.

04:32.120 --> 04:37.080
I fluked a boss,
next-door-neighbour and friend.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.120
All in one.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.800
The family come up as much as
possible. I go down to see Dad.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.480
Has anyone got a ten?

04:50.480 --> 04:52.800
The kids
are wonderful with him.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.320
- Go fish!
- That helps so much.

04:55.320 --> 05:00.160
You do lose touch with people,
though. It happens.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.520
Time happens.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
Buradeena happened.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.440
And here we are,
two years later.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.080
And here I am.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.680
Big day. You?

05:19.680 --> 05:22.520
Busy afternoon. Country Women's
girls are out in force.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.600
Oh, stop it.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.880
It's about
the fifth one of those.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.320
Hm?

05:33.320 --> 05:34.400
New-agey things.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.200
You looking for answers?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.280
No. I'm just sick of novels.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.480
That's the good thing about not
reading. Can't get sick of it.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.320
That's us. With our 35th
anniversary approaching.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.920
Dave settled.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.080
But my first thought
every morning

05:57.080 --> 05:59.960
is that something's missing.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.760
It was Ruby that put me
on the road to an answer.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.240
You sure you don't need a lift?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.640
Stuff to do on the way.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.600
- Lugging all of that?
- I'm alright.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.760
With a painting...

06:10.760 --> 06:13.480
- I'll see you there.
- Don't be late.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.120
...and some poo.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.840
Who says life's not strange?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.520
Yappy!

06:23.520 --> 06:26.960
Hi. Yappy.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.600
Hi! Ay you.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.360
Donation gratefully received.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.840
Oh, hello, you.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.720
Hi. Um...

06:45.160 --> 06:48.840
From one small act,
great change.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.280
Yoo-hoo.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.080
Ah! In here.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.200
Is Ruby on a clean-up kick?

06:54.200 --> 06:55.960
Hm?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.880
She just grabbed Yappy's crap
from the front yard.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.320
- Oh. Dave?
- Yeah!

07:02.320 --> 07:05.400
Why would Ruby be grabbing
dog poo from Tessa's yard?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.400
Hey. Search me.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.760
Paddo! Come on!
You're dragging the chain.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.400
Stress will kill you, mate.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.720
Thanks, Mrs. R.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.920
Cougar cool there, Tess.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.440
Oh, I wish.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.000
Move ya arse, big fella.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.560
Boys will be boys.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.240
Ah, second childhood.
Hey, don't forget the art show.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.760
I'll pick you up.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.720
So... poo.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.160
Uh... Ruby's Ruby.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.400
Alright, come on.
Paintings on the wall.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.960
Place your sculptures carefully
on the tables. Oi!

07:47.960 --> 07:50.560
Nice work there, girls.
Well done.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.840
Oh, beautiful work there, Hugo.
Well done.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.360
Alright, come on, guys.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.880
C'mon. I want you here
straight after the final bell.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.720
We're expecting a lot
of parents.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.200
Well done, Ruby.
Come on, let's pop it up.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.400
Uh... it's meant to be like
that.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Why?

08:08.040 --> 08:09.960
Ruby?

08:09.960 --> 08:12.160
Otherwise they'll roll off.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.560
Ruby...

08:13.560 --> 08:15.960
Is there a problem?

08:22.680 --> 08:25.240
Hello.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.720
Oh, Mrs Spade.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.760
What's she done now?

08:32.680 --> 08:35.040
- Dave?
- Yeah.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.440
The school,
they want to see us both.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.160
Don't tell me - the poo.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.640
How do you know?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.360
Wild guess.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.040
A primary school art
show

08:48.040 --> 08:49.720
is no place for faecal matter.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.760
It's a health issue.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.240
She's got a point, Rubes.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.320
And "Stubborn Old Men?"
A title designed to offend.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.000
It's true, though.
Climate-denying politicians.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.600
After last summer, Ruby
is worried about the future.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.760
Global warming, pollution...

09:07.760 --> 09:11.240
So she chooses some sound grab
from the media as her title?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.960
She's too young to even
understand what she's saying.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.520
Oh, I think a lot of our
children understand these days.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
Try debating her
on it some time.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.520
Actually...

09:19.520 --> 09:21.880
Whatever I feel
about her notions,

09:21.880 --> 09:23.760
it's not a political rally.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.400
I hear you.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.880
Most art is political.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.240
Not at Buradeena
Primary end of term exhibition.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.720
The issue, Mrs. Rafter,
is doo-doo.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.080
Doo-doo?

09:37.080 --> 09:38.440
Doggie doo.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.600
Or don't do.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.480
Don't express the fears our
children

09:41.480 --> 09:43.760
have of inheriting a world
too polluted to live in.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.040
A world left to them
by stubborn old men.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.000
- The title fits.
- Settle.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.160
I think it's the one interesting
statement in the room.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.520
We did not ask for
statements.

09:56.520 --> 10:00.640
The title is unfortunate.
The doo-doo unacceptable.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.640
And without it?

10:04.360 --> 10:08.280
A perfectly lovely abstract
of the world from space.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.320
Another title, preferably.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.520
Right.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.880
Mrs. Rafter...

10:14.880 --> 10:16.320
Julie.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.880
Lose the doo-doo, darling.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.880
Oil.
Not just for the car.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.880
There we go.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.760
No health issue there.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.040
Oh, and new title -
"Fossil Fools."

10:37.080 --> 10:38.640
Says what you want to.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.480
Loving it.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.280
Ah, seems to fit the criteria.
Do we have a deal?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.200
She's her mother's daughter.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.400
Legendary, Mum.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.160
Yes, well, next time you
get a bright idea,

10:57.160 --> 10:59.760
make sure you run
it by us first.

10:59.760 --> 11:04.160
I knew you'd say no. You stuck
up for me but you would have.

11:05.560 --> 11:06.760
That's true.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.680
How come?

11:09.480 --> 11:12.840
Because not everyone
appreciates nine going on 19.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.600
Kids your age aren't meant
to have political opinions.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.240
That's so Buradeena.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.400
No, I think you'd find that
anywhere!

11:19.400 --> 11:21.320
More likely here.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.000
Hey.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.520
We love Buradeena.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.960
Dad loves Buradeena.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.520
You love bits but all I'd miss
would be Paddo.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.520
Right. Well, like you say,
your dad loves Buradeena

11:36.520 --> 11:39.240
and we love your dad so...

11:39.240 --> 11:41.240
And I think if you made a list

11:41.240 --> 11:43.120
of the things you like
about Buradeena,

11:43.120 --> 11:45.480
it would be a lot
longer than just Paddo.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.800
Tessa - for a start.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.720
OK, mwah.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.840
Goodnight.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.240
I bet if you made
a "don't like" list

11:56.240 --> 11:58.960
it'd be a lot longer
than your "do likes."

12:00.840 --> 12:02.800
Go to sleep.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.800
Every small town needs
an art scandal.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.760
Buradeena now has theirs.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.520
She put poo on the painting.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.400
Seriously?

12:29.400 --> 12:33.080
Absolutely 100% real poo.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.640
Well, at least it's given
business a boost.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.400
They are dying
to have a go at you.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.480
Well, why don't they?

12:38.480 --> 12:41.080
They like you enough
not to say it to your face.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.480
Take it as a compliment.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.360
Someone's gotta be on our side.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.200
Most – on climate change.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.320
None on Ruby's.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.680
That one over there.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.160
"We don't need
some uppity city kid

12:51.160 --> 12:53.840
"telling us what we know,
stinking up the school."

12:53.840 --> 12:55.440
We've been here two years.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.640
You've gotta be born country
to be country.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.800
The old power of
persuasion.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.440
Have I still got what it takes?

13:19.400 --> 13:20.720
How flush are we?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.120
Flush enough.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.520
To allow you to take some
time off?

13:25.520 --> 13:27.600
I'm pretty booked.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.200
I just thought we could get away
for the school break.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.600
Let the fuss die down.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.640
The kids are coming
for our anniversary.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.680
Yeah, but the highway
leads to them

13:36.680 --> 13:39.960
as easily as it does to us.
Can't we celebrate there?

13:39.960 --> 13:41.920
Not like you to run.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.800
Call it a tactical withdrawal.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.120
I just think we could all do
with some city. I know I could.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.720
And Ruby never says no, so...

13:54.080 --> 13:55.520
Paddo could hold the fort.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.720
Thank you. Mwah!

13:57.720 --> 13:59.040
But I... um...

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
Ah, yes.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.360
It seems I do.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.920
So the Poogate scandal
had us heading off.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.920
Oh, they've booked
Shanghai Express. Awww.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.840
That's where we had our 25th.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.880
You weren't even a twinkle
in my eye, Rubes.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.720
Oh, gross, Dad.

14:39.720 --> 14:44.560
Polar bears are invading towns
they've never gone into before.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.680
They're starving.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.280
Rich white men,
poor white bears.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.440
Good title.

14:58.240 --> 15:04.400
Don't come back?
Bored country kids.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.960
Another one for
the "don't like" list.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.520
A change of scene.
Just what we needed.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.840
Hello, petal.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.960
You talking to me?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.040
I would never call my boss
petal.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.240
I think you just did.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.000
She did, right?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.760
See? We both talk to flowers.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.720
Hey, if they're
left over tonight,

15:36.720 --> 15:38.720
you should take them
home for Cassie.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.040
Good thinking.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.760
Ben. Phone.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.520
- Who?
- Nathan.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.800
Tell him I'll call him back.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.360
Your brother sounds rather
flustered.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.160
Mate, this is a
disaster.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.680
So sorry. Total bummer.
We'll fit you all in somehow.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.520
What about my toys?

16:05.760 --> 16:08.600
We'll get them when we can,
little guy, OK?

16:10.760 --> 16:13.880
Cassie will be fine with it.
I'll catch you at mine.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.600
It's an emergency, Donna.
Reckon you could sub for me?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.440
With 50 for dinner?
This'd better be good.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.480
How's Nathan's building's
falling down?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.640
He's out on the
street.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.120
Mum, Dad and Ruby are lobbing

16:24.120 --> 16:27.160
and we'll have to fit seven
people into a two-bedroom house.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.560
Better than most excuses.
What happened?

16:29.560 --> 16:31.960
I don't know. One of those
structural flaw thingys.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.680
He rocked up home and cops
and emergency were everywhere.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.000
They won't let anyone in.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.440
Go, yes. Poor Nathan. Tell your
mum I can't wait to see her.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.640
Yeah.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.320
Quick sticks.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.240
I have an air mattress.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.400
Thank you.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.600
We can blow it up later.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.720
How are they?

16:55.720 --> 16:57.880
Edward thinks it's
a big adventure.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.720
While Nathan's a little bit
rattled.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.160
Are you OK with this?

17:01.160 --> 17:02.880
- Of course.
- You sure?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.400
We both are.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.560
- Cute answer.
- It's going to be a cute kid.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.560
Donna said Mum and Dad can
stay with her

17:12.560 --> 17:13.720
if it gets too much.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.640
It's their anniversary.
No way.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.160
It's not going to be for long.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.400
How did I get so lucky?

17:18.400 --> 17:19.800
You swiped right.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.560
It was a hot photo.
Had no choice.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.880
Gotta love
modern dating rituals.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.760
Uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben. Where are you?!

17:29.760 --> 17:31.560
Better go check on them.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.560
Attaboy, eh?

17:36.560 --> 17:39.080
You tuck that side in,
I'll do this one.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.720
You might fall out
of a little bed, Dad.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.320
I certainly won't be able
to spread out, that's for sure.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.080
Lucky we didn't rush to set this
up as a nursery.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.080
We were just discussing
the limitations of a single bed.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.280
That'll take you back.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.320
Oh, sure will.

17:54.760 --> 17:58.040
Hey Eddie, please stop bouncing,
alright? It's not our bed, mate.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.240
Hey, Eddie. Auntie Cassie's got
some cake if you're up for it.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.080
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.760
Your place won't fall down,
will it, Uncle Ben?

18:08.760 --> 18:11.480
No way. Go on.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.160
He seems fine.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.200
He's the glass half-full kid.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.960
How are you?

18:18.960 --> 18:22.320
Add mine to the list of
defective apartment blocks.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.880
They reckon
the foundations have subsided.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.040
Well... at least you're both
safe.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.280
It's probably worth about
half of what I paid for it now.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.160
Mum and Dad.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.800
Yeah. Just let them
settle first, hey? Yeah?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.440
Oh, thanks.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.640
You made good time!

18:48.640 --> 18:51.080
"'Heavy on the Metal Dave"
they call me.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.240
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.800
How's our embryonic darling?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.720
Ben shouldn't have told
you.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.440
It's early, I know,
but he's rapt.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.880
Ruby!

18:59.880 --> 19:02.280
Same name as last time you
saw me.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.560
Oi! What about us?

19:03.560 --> 19:06.200
- Hey!
- Granny!

19:06.200 --> 19:08.560
- Granddad!
- Hey, kiddo.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.040
Looks like we've got the whole
welcoming committee.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.200
Hey. I guess you have.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.960
Hi, Mum.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.000
We're here 'cause
our place is falling down.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.320
What?

19:23.320 --> 19:25.720
Thanks, Eddie.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.960
Come on.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.280
You're not lifting a
finger while we're here.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.880
I'm not an invalid.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.800
No, but you're
carrying our grandchild

19:36.800 --> 19:38.440
and you got the Rafters roadshow

19:38.440 --> 19:40.880
so you just sit there
and catch me up on everything.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.640
- Well, I'll just...
- Ah! Sit!

19:42.640 --> 19:43.800
OK!

19:45.920 --> 19:47.800
Everything fine?

19:47.800 --> 19:51.760
So far. It's gonna be.
I just have to...

19:53.480 --> 19:57.680
You're talking IVF. You are.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.680
- Right?
- We are.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.080
It beats collapsing apartment
blocks on loop.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.720
How many ways
can you say "This is screwed?"

20:07.720 --> 20:09.520
Hey, language.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.080
And we're pulling our weight,
thank you.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.800
I'll make sure the men know
so they can do their share.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.520
The men are sorting the
sleeping arrangements.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.800
Such a cliche
division of labor.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.320
She's either going to end up
an anarchist or prime minister.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.520
Buradeena's betting
on the former.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.000
Oh, and make up your own bed.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
The couch, right?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.040
Yes. Sheets and stuff are
in the hallway.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.160
How come she takes after the one
sibling she's hardly seen.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.320
Rachel?

20:43.320 --> 20:46.080
Yeah, she gave
good attitude at that age.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.000
You all gave your fair share.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.880
- What?

20:58.480 --> 21:02.280
The mattress. It's like my life.
It needs the air back in.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.480
I mean, come on.
Trust me to buy a lemon.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.320
It mightn't be
as bad as it seems.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.880
Oh! Every other place
it's happened has been.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.440
I think the word you're
looking for is "disaster!"

21:17.080 --> 21:22.080
Anything you need. You know
that. Whatever we can afford.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.480
None of you are made of money.
I'm not asking Rachel.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.080
Well, she wouldn't mind.
Just get her by herself.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.040
If she does manage to make it.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.960
She's trying.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.760
She wouldn't leave deciding
to the last minute if she was.

21:39.760 --> 21:43.040
She is busy.
New York's a long haul.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.680
Yeah. Yeah.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.320
Yeah.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.200
Goodnight.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.080
Don't let
the bed bugs bite.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.920
Dad...
Sleep tight!

21:58.920 --> 22:00.440
Thank you all.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.720
Whatever, whenever.
Sweet dreams.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.280
- Dave!
- Gross, Dad.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.480
It's not me. It's the mattress.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.520
Sprung a leak.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.800
Got a surprise.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.400
Poor Nathan.
What a shemozzle.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.680
Hello, stranger.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.760
Oh!

23:02.760 --> 23:05.160
Cheese and nibbles.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.560
And if seeing you isn't the best
excuse for vino before noon,

23:08.560 --> 23:09.760
I don't know what is.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.920
Nathan's building falling down.
Goodness. How is he?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.280
Well, they're
letting people back in today

23:17.280 --> 23:18.800
but just to get essentials.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.560
It's not sounding good.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.360
If there's anything
I can do to help.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.680
Thanks.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.880
Now, you, country life
agrees with you.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.000
Ah.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.360
Either that, or you snuck off

23:29.360 --> 23:31.160
for a nip and a tuck without
telling me.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.880
I miss you.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.880
Well, you can visit whenever you
want.

23:34.880 --> 23:39.000
What, with this place to run?
Work, work, work.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.000
I'm sure I look a fright.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.920
You look glowing.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.240
35th anniversary.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.320
Mmm-hmm.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.360
Gorgeous.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.320
I just wish we could throw
the party here.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.360
We're celebrating where
we had our 25th.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.440
Ben said.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.280
- Yeah.
- Lovely.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.120
All the family?

23:57.120 --> 23:59.920
Dad. Depends on this afternoon.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.400
I'm sure he'll be fine.
And that's worth drinking to.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.840
It is.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.560
And to the wicked girls' night
we're having before you go back.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.720
- To friendship.
- To friendship.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
That it?
Yeah.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.520
Yep. They're letting us
back in tomorrow

24:32.520 --> 24:34.240
if there's anything we forgot.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.600
Big of them.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.520
And that's it till they
work out what's next.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.600
Could be months, the guy
reckons.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.720
He had this look in his eye
that said "maybe never."

24:44.720 --> 24:46.720
- He probably didn't.
- No, he did.

24:46.720 --> 24:51.600
He did. The upside is it can't
get much worse, right?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.440
We visit dad once a
month, at least.

25:15.440 --> 25:19.360
He's going downhill.
But slower than expected.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.960
Ready?

25:24.520 --> 25:27.680
I'll settle for a smile.
Even if he doesn't recognise us.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.920
I'll test the water.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.120
Hey, Dad.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.360
My little girl.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.600
I was just saying
to your mum this morning,

25:47.600 --> 25:50.760
"It's been a while
since Julie dropped by."

25:50.760 --> 25:55.560
I said, "Get Julie something
good for her anniversary."

25:55.560 --> 26:00.680
We're off to Shanghai Express
and kung pao chicken.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.440
You remember!

26:03.440 --> 26:06.720
A fella doesn't forget
something like that.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.000
Oh, Dad.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.480
Remember we were out the
front where we got the photo

26:18.480 --> 26:22.560
taken and we ended up
with S-E-X over our heads?

26:22.560 --> 26:24.240
Sort of rings a bell.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.800
Sex.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.480
Where's your mum?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.400
Um... she wasn't there
that night, Dad.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.320
Of course she was.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.720
No, she'd passed away by then.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.160
Don't be so bloody silly.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.360
Settle, Dad.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.160
Maybe you just thought
she was.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.480
I know what I know.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.960
Don't get upset, Granddad.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.560
She's talkin' rubbish!

26:46.560 --> 26:49.520
You know what?
Maybe I just got confused.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.920
As if your mum
wouldn't be there!

26:52.600 --> 26:54.200
She loves you, your mum.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.400
Yeah, I know.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.080
We better go.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.360
OK, well, we'll be back to pick

27:01.360 --> 27:03.800
you up in three days time, Dad,
OK?

27:03.800 --> 27:06.320
At00.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.080
I'll be ready.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.920
No show without punch.

27:10.920 --> 27:15.200
Yeah. See you then.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.920
- See you, Ted.
- Bye, Granddad.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.960
Bye.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.440
You sure it's worth
taking the risk?

27:26.440 --> 27:28.080
He was good just then.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.520
And we managed when he wasn't.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.440
One of his big turns
could ruin the night.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.080
It's not like it hasn't
happened.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.160
- I'll watch him.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.800
Another option is we could all
drop in here on the way. What?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.160
Well, just saying.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.560
Look, I understand
but I'd rather be positive.

27:45.560 --> 27:49.000
That was so lovely
sharing the memories.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.480
What say we share some more? Hm?

28:14.160 --> 28:17.600
- Do you remember it?
- Sort of. Not really.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.360
It's almost 30 of
our 35 years here.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.840
Good times.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.760
Wonderful.

28:24.760 --> 28:27.120
All of us under the same
roof.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.200
Ben next door.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.920
It was a special time.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.040
Yeah, it was.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.400
You want to knock on the door?

28:41.280 --> 28:45.200
You know, I thought I did
but no, I don't.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.360
No.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.920
No going back.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.480
No. What's past is past.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.960
Golden time.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.720
Living the dream now, though.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.280
Yasou koukla!

29:07.280 --> 29:09.960
When your romance
is starting to cool

29:09.960 --> 29:12.320
and your chickadee is not giving
you the honey

29:12.320 --> 29:13.840
as much as you
think she oughta,

29:13.840 --> 29:15.400
this will get her every time.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.200
Yasou koukla -
hello, babydoll.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.440
Not to be mistaken
for "yasou katsika,"

29:20.440 --> 29:22.440
which means, "hello, goat."

29:22.440 --> 29:24.280
And definitely don't dress
like that.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.960
She'll likely tell you to get,
get, get, get carbonated.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.840
Next time, I'm gonna
go skateboarding

29:29.840 --> 29:31.360
around the Acropolis.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.800
That's actually taken off?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.920
Yeah. It makes people laugh.
He still makes me laugh.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.320
He really has over a million?

29:38.320 --> 29:41.000
Yeah, and sponsors
and other platforms.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.640
Mate, we're in the wrong game.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.880
Oh! Tell me about it.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.960
Oh. I gotta return the van.
Eddie?

29:47.960 --> 29:49.240
Or I could do it?

29:49.240 --> 29:50.800
No, no, no.
You have done plenty.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.480
Besides, little man here will
enjoy some time by the river.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.600
Hey! We gotta go.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.800
I was just putting
my stuff away.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.680
No, it's alright, we'll finish
it later. Come on, come on.
Let's roll!

30:03.000 --> 30:05.840
Retta must wonder sometimes.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.760
She gets the joke.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.040
What?

30:12.040 --> 30:13.840
Nothing.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.400
Oh, no.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.480
Cassie?

30:37.240 --> 30:39.200
Cass?

30:39.200 --> 30:41.920
We're losing it, Ben.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.480
You were right.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.760
I shouldn't have said anything.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.000
You OK?

31:23.720 --> 31:25.520
You heard the doctor.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.520
I'll be fine.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.320
You sure you're up to covering?

31:35.640 --> 31:38.360
I don't want to spoil
their anniversary.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.600
It's just for a few days.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.320
We can try again.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.640
I can't do it.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.480
Keep practicing.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.960
Pirates. Pirates!

32:13.960 --> 32:16.280
En garde, ye scoundrel.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.440
Ha hoo-ha!

32:17.440 --> 32:20.040
- OK, everyone. Let's go.
- Take that and that!

32:20.040 --> 32:21.600
I thought you were teaching him!

32:21.600 --> 32:23.120
Oh. Eddie's pirates game.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.120
- Let's hit the frog-and-toad.
- Don't invite them to dinner.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.000
Oh, Ben, did you confirm
the table?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.400
It's Sunday night,
the queue could be a mile long.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.440
Onto it.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.840
If we're a few minutes late,
it 'll be because of Dad.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.680
All aboard The Shanghai Express.

32:44.680 --> 32:48.080
Ah! Eddie, please leave
the lobster alone.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.800
I wonder if everyone knows
something we don't.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.960
When was the last time you were
here?

33:03.960 --> 33:05.600
Ages ago.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.000
Henry was talking of selling.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.720
Well, I'd say he has.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.560
Lazy Susan, Lazy Susan.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.320
- That's lame, I know.
- Actually not.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.640
I say that we skip the prawns.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.080
I want prawns!

33:22.080 --> 33:25.400
Mate, trust me...

33:25.400 --> 33:27.080
You listen to your dad, Nathan.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.960
I'm Nathan, Grandad.
This is Edward.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.320
Kung pao chicken!

33:36.320 --> 33:38.840
Mmm! That was dad's favourite
when we used to come here.

33:38.840 --> 33:44.240
I love it too, Ted. What's
that Chinese lass doing here?

33:44.240 --> 33:48.240
This is Cassie, Grandad,
my wife. And she is Vietnamese.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.080
Where's Mel? You're not Mel.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.640
Mel died, Dad.

33:55.480 --> 33:59.360
Oh. Well, you moved on
fast enough.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.360
- A long time ago.
- Do you remember?

34:02.360 --> 34:06.520
I like Mel. Yeah.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.120
We all did.

34:09.120 --> 34:13.200
You should've had kids.
You got kiddies?

34:13.200 --> 34:15.840
Um, no. No, I don't, Ted.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.040
Ah, waste of a life, no kiddies.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.640
Mel liked the Chinese.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.760
Dad!

34:20.760 --> 34:22.280
She wasn't a racist, our Mel.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.160
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no it's fine...

34:24.160 --> 34:26.480
- Can we just order please?
- Miss?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.440
Excuse me.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.000
Thank you.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.600
Thanks.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.040
Ben said.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.160
Three days covering.

34:59.800 --> 35:03.520
I've had my friend
Anna to talk to.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.120
So like you to put us first.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.080
He's so desperate
to hold his baby.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.320
Would you think about yourself
for a change?

35:13.320 --> 35:15.400
Let us be there for you.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.880
Just rest.

35:18.880 --> 35:21.160
Let your body restore.

35:21.160 --> 35:25.960
And when you're ready,
maybe another try.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.560
Four times?

35:28.560 --> 35:31.640
I don't know if I can
bear it again.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.920
I told him before we got married

35:37.920 --> 35:40.800
that I had problems
in that area.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.840
We were so in love.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.160
What if he stops loving me?

35:47.160 --> 35:50.640
Oh, Cassie. You are so loved.

35:50.640 --> 35:55.760
By all of us. Never doubt that.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.880
OK?

36:01.880 --> 36:05.640
I will be.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.440
Rachel.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.920
Oh, go, go. I'll be fine.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.040
OK.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.360
You too.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.200
You sure?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
Yeah.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.760
I just need a minute.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.400
Here she is.
Rachel, hi!

36:37.400 --> 36:38.600
Hi.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.640
Shanghai Express isn't
what it used to be.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.520
- No kung pao chicken.
- Mum!

36:42.520 --> 36:43.920
The ultimate sin.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.640
Not according
to your grandfather.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.760
Hello. Hi, sweetheart. Look!

36:47.760 --> 36:50.360
We set the laptop up with its
own seat as if you were here.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.440
I would be if I could.
I did try.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.680
Yes, we know you did.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.480
She's wearing her pyjamas.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.640
It's early morning here,
Grandad.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.080
- It's night!
- I'm in New York.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.280
We miss you.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.880
I miss you all too.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.880
So what's the news?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.360
Nathan's apartment's screwed.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.400
Language!

37:07.400 --> 37:08.800
- Well, it is.
- What?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.120
You're a downer, Rube.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.040
Yeah. Bad
building practices.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.360
I'll send you the news link.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.160
It's happened
to about five places.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.520
Nath, what are you gonna do?

37:16.520 --> 37:19.760
Stay with Benno for a bit.
You know, forget about that.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.800
Now that you're here
and I've got the floor,

37:21.800 --> 37:23.960
have you
got a glass of something?

37:23.960 --> 37:25.640
Opening the bottle now.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.120
Solo drinking - careful.
That's assuming you are solo.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.160
O solo mio. You know me.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.040
I would like to propose
a toast

37:33.040 --> 37:35.640
to the best parents
in the world.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.600
I'm glad they married,

37:37.600 --> 37:40.000
if for no other reason
than we were all born.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.960
Such self-interest.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.560
And because we love
them.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.600
- Oh!
- Amen to that.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.640
- Thank you.
- Cassie, grab your glass.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.960
And let's all raise them to the
legendary Dave and Julie Rafter

37:51.960 --> 37:54.760
as they celebrate
35 wonderful years.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.960
To our father, mother,
grandfather, grandmother,

37:57.960 --> 37:59.640
son-in-law and daughter.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.760
And our role models
for happiness.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.520
- That's quite a responsibility.
- You're up to it.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.960
To Mum and Dad.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.160
To Mum and Dad!

38:07.160 --> 38:08.400
Cheers!

38:16.960 --> 38:18.440
- Oi!
- Ay!

38:18.440 --> 38:20.440
That's me. I've gotta go
get ready for work.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.480
Wait! Before you go - any news?
Anything exciting?

38:22.480 --> 38:23.800
Nothing that won't keep.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.400
Oh. Did you run a
marathon?

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
Ah, not this year.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.520
But you always do.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.480
I had other things
going.

38:29.480 --> 38:32.200
Oh, OK well, don't work
too hard. We miss you.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.400
- Love you. See ya.
- Bye.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.280
Love you.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.880
Alright, everyone. Back
to ours for kung pao chicken -

38:40.880 --> 38:41.880
what do you say?

38:41.880 --> 38:44.880
Yes. Let's do it.

39:24.360 --> 39:28.600
Plenty of time to meet them
once you're born, munchkin.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.520
Kung pao chicken.

39:35.520 --> 39:42.160
Like a life well lived,
you marinate your feelings...

39:44.160 --> 39:46.840
Make sure there is flavour.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.320
Plenty of sizzle.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.280
Make sure nothing sticks.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.640
Add heat. Flesh. Spice.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.160
And stir together.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.640
Then garnish
to individual taste.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.040
And if you're very lucky,
it's done with love.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.640
Dinner is served.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.880
Two, four, six, eight.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.040
A good life.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.640
Bog in, don't wait.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.040
Aye!

40:15.760 --> 40:17.000
Thank you.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.160
Dave and I,
kung pao chicken, with love.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.440
But if it goes wrong,
like Ben and Cassie,

40:24.440 --> 40:26.920
you're missing an ingredient.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.160
Chow down, Mum.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.640
Well, hurry up.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.200
If you going to serve me food,
you gotta do it quick.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.480
Or Ruby.
There's too much sauce.

40:35.480 --> 40:40.200
Kung pao chicken, Jules.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.960
- That's Ruby, Grandad.
- Who?

40:42.960 --> 40:47.520
Dad,
you forget the recipe.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.640
Or Nathan. It just won't
come together, somehow.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.200
And it all gets out of whack.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.360
Past your bedtime, Eddie.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.520
PJs on, brush your teeth.
Come on.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.040
Come on, Ruby.
Wait a second.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.880
35 years, Mrs. Rafter.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.680
Mmm-hmm.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.520
- Come here.
- Oh!

41:17.520 --> 41:22.000
All the ups and downs, the ins
and outs and here we still are.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.880
It's quite an achievement in
the modern age.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.400
I reckon so.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.440
I remember being nervous about
my performance on our 25th.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.400
But with this set up,
there's no chance

41:34.400 --> 41:36.360
of any performance to be
nervous about.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.920
Well, you could file it
away under business pending.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.400
It better not pend too long.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.520
- You've still got it, you know?
- Oh, stop it.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.640
- Oh, you love it.
- I do!

41:44.640 --> 41:48.080
I'm just pulling my
weight. Oh!

41:49.320 --> 41:50.640
Oops.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.320
Still life in the old folks yet.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.920
It's way too much information,
thank you, Dad.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.680
Half your luck.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.880
Oh, I worry about him.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.280
It's been so long since there's
been anyone.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.880
Hard with a kid in tow.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.040
Yeah, he must miss intimacy.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.640
I miss intimacy.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.440
- Oh! You get quite enough.
- Well...

42:12.440 --> 42:14.360
Here. You rinse, I'll stack.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.840
- Romantic.
- Practical.

42:17.960 --> 42:22.080
I do worry. How we
used to clean up after them.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.480
Yeah, we still are.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.520
No, I mean, you know,

42:24.520 --> 42:26.360
when things went
wrong in their lives,

42:26.360 --> 42:28.040
we used to be there
to help clean up.

42:28.040 --> 42:29.400
They're adults now.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.920
Yeah, well, they're still ours.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.880
What brought this on?

42:32.880 --> 42:34.520
Kung pao chicken.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.360
What?

42:36.360 --> 42:38.920
Metaphor overload.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.400
And Dad's just
so much more alert.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.640
In his own funny way.

42:42.640 --> 42:46.080
It just seems wrong going back
with so much happening.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.080
Ben and Cassie don't need this
place stacked to the ceiling.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.480
- Well, they're coping.
- They need to heal.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.040
Our life is back home.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.880
Yes, and they're down here.
And we could help them heal.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.840
And Ruby could do
with a longer break.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.800
- A few days, sure.
- No, longer!

42:59.800 --> 43:01.520
We help Ben and Cassie,

43:01.520 --> 43:04.120
we get Nathan back on his feet,
we can see Dad more.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.760
Ruby could go
to Edward's school.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.760
- How much longer?
- Play it by ear. A while.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.560
- And where are we in that?
- We're parents.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.800
Yeah, with our own life.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.520
I have a business,
you have a job.

43:14.520 --> 43:17.840
Where would we live,
for a start?

43:17.840 --> 43:20.160
This set up is fine
for a few days, tops.

43:20.160 --> 43:22.800
I'm just not sure where you're
coming from.

43:22.800 --> 43:27.080
Look I just... I know is what we
have to do or we're bad parents.

43:38.480 --> 43:42.040
We're not bad parents.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.880
The best way to help Nathan
is to earn

43:45.880 --> 43:48.360
the money he'll probably
need to borrow.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.640
And Ben and Cassie will be fine.

43:51.640 --> 43:56.280
- I mean it, Dave.
- So do I.

43:56.280 --> 44:00.200
You said it yourself,
outside the old place.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.520
The past is the past.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.680
We're not those parents now.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.360
Always are.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.520
Rubes is responsibility enough.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.120
It's our time, Jules.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.080
Let's sleep on it.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.440
Poogate, a miscarriage,
a crumbling building,

44:29.440 --> 44:33.280
a crumbling mind, and something
Rachel's not saying.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.040
I've felt it for a long time.

44:38.760 --> 44:42.240
Someone has to help clean up.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.840
That's when it hit me.

44:48.480 --> 44:52.800
I've been looking for an answer
to a scary question.

44:54.120 --> 44:58.840
I'm not the woman I was. So...

45:03.520 --> 45:06.040
Who am I?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.120
I wanna move back here.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.800
For good.
