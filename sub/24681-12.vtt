00:01.748 --> 00:04.273
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.351 --> 00:06.376
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.453 --> 00:09.217
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.289 --> 00:11.018
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:14.861 --> 00:16.453
I'm there now.

00:17.197 --> 00:18.425
Mmm-hmm.

00:18.799 --> 00:20.494
No, I don't see...

00:21.134 --> 00:22.123
Oh.

00:29.776 --> 00:32.006
I can't believe
there's another...

00:35.315 --> 00:36.782
I have to go.

00:38.318 --> 00:42.584
They got the fire out, but
all that smoke and water...

00:43.657 --> 00:46.490
Uncle Mike thinks
maybe they can be saved.

00:48.362 --> 00:50.523
Dorian, I'm so sorry.

00:51.331 --> 00:53.128
Not your fault.

00:54.167 --> 00:55.657
You're sweet.

00:58.138 --> 01:01.505
I need to use the
restroom. Don't go away.

01:08.715 --> 01:10.615
Jocelyn, your phone...

01:18.558 --> 01:19.752
Hello?

01:26.867 --> 01:29.165
Show me the bottom. I need
to see the bottom of the box.

01:29.236 --> 01:31.670
Everything you need to see is online.

01:31.738 --> 01:32.966
Maybe I want
to buy it now.

01:33.039 --> 01:35.530
You want it,
go online.

01:39.146 --> 01:43.207
It's an apartment building, 255
East Barrington, Apartment 18.

01:43.283 --> 01:45.945
This is 255
East Barrington, mister.

01:46.019 --> 01:49.455
And Apartment 18's
right there. Third row.

01:55.829 --> 01:59.356
I'm not coming out!
You'll have to shoot me first!

02:00.667 --> 02:01.929
His name's
Arnold Pierce.

02:02.002 --> 02:04.266
Neighbors say he lives alone,
but they heard a woman inside.

02:05.439 --> 02:07.805
He's got a gun!
He's going to kill me!

02:10.342 --> 02:12.072
Drop the weapon.
Drop it!

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074

02:24.257 --> 02:25.656
Where's the hostage?

02:25.725 --> 02:28.159
Where is it?
Where's the gun?

03:26.219 --> 03:29.120
The neighbors heard yelling, a
man, a woman, things breaking.

03:29.189 --> 03:31.089
The man refused
to open the door.

03:31.157 --> 03:34.524
Did he seem
scared or angry?

03:35.095 --> 03:36.187
Upset.

03:36.263 --> 03:37.787
And the woman shouted
he had a gun,

03:37.864 --> 03:39.798
we heard a shot,
we went in.

03:39.866 --> 03:41.197
He had something
in his hand.

03:41.268 --> 03:43.327
He turned toward us,
we heard another shot.

03:43.403 --> 03:45.303
You see
a muzzle flash?

03:48.608 --> 03:50.075
We know
how she got out?

03:50.143 --> 03:51.269
Fire escape's
in the bedroom.

03:51.344 --> 03:53.437
The window was open
when we came in.

03:53.513 --> 03:55.276
Thank you, Sergeant.

03:59.085 --> 04:02.384
IAB's gonna eat them alive
for this shooting.

04:02.455 --> 04:04.616
The place looks like
Pee-wee's Playhouse.

04:04.691 --> 04:06.818
'50s sci-fi toys.

04:07.994 --> 04:10.360
Pierce took fanatical care
of his collection,

04:10.430 --> 04:14.662
even put anti-UV film
on the windows

04:14.734 --> 04:17.168
to keep the boxes
from fading.

04:17.237 --> 04:20.673
If she was tossing his toys
around, no wonder he got upset.

04:23.009 --> 04:25.944
These toys have
been smashed.

04:26.012 --> 04:30.415
He might've done it himself in
some kind of self-destructive rage.

04:32.085 --> 04:36.021
Pointing a toy at a cop is a good
way to get yourself destroyed.

04:36.089 --> 04:37.522
More UV film.

04:37.924 --> 04:39.221
But no toys.

04:39.993 --> 04:42.985
This empty space,
it's a place of honor.

04:43.063 --> 04:46.430
Something important would
have gone on that shelf.

04:46.499 --> 04:50.697
Lots of stuff disappearing,
toys, guns, hostages.

04:55.642 --> 04:57.303
I think I found the gun.

05:00.280 --> 05:04.944
Through the door, muffled,
it could sound like a gunshot.

05:05.018 --> 05:08.146
The second pop came when Pierce
was turning toward the officers.

05:08.221 --> 05:09.415
The packaging
was in the bedroom,

05:09.489 --> 05:11.753
where the girl went out the fire escape.

05:11.825 --> 05:14.885
She yelled he had a gun,
popped the bags.

05:16.463 --> 05:17.521
She wanted Pierce dead.

05:17.597 --> 05:19.394
And used our guys
to do it.

05:19.466 --> 05:22.196
Bring in the girl.
We'll talk about it.

05:23.737 --> 05:26.900
My brother never hurt anybody.
Why'd they have to shoot him?

05:26.973 --> 05:30.602
Mr. Pierce, we think that someone
might have provoked the shooting,

05:30.677 --> 05:33.202
a woman,
maybe his girlfriend.

05:33.279 --> 05:34.871
Arnie had a girlfriend?

05:34.948 --> 05:36.745
He's not interested
in women?

05:36.816 --> 05:41.480
He was. But last summer, I set
him up with a girl from work.

05:43.323 --> 05:45.655
All he talked about
was his toys.

05:46.693 --> 05:48.126
Where did he buy his toys?

05:48.194 --> 05:49.821
At toy conventions.

05:51.331 --> 05:54.858
The money he spent on that
junk. It was out of control.

05:54.934 --> 05:57.994
He tried to borrow 1,000 bucks
from our mom a couple of weeks ago.

05:58.071 --> 06:01.734
And he got 30 grand from a
car accident six months ago.

06:01.808 --> 06:02.968
It's all gone.

06:03.043 --> 06:05.034
He had a shelf
over his bed.

06:06.312 --> 06:08.007
Do you know what
he kept on there?

06:08.081 --> 06:12.484
Yeah, some robot from
an old kid's TV show.

06:12.552 --> 06:15.419
A Space Legion Rorbit.

06:17.891 --> 06:19.688
He loved that thing.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.663
Thank you, Mr. Pierce. The
officer will show you out.

06:31.071 --> 06:34.165
A lonely man gets a girlfriend, he
might spend more than he could afford.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.141
Even sell off his most
precious possession.

06:38.712 --> 06:40.839
If he didn't,
maybe she did.

06:44.417 --> 06:47.409
I don't know. It gets
busy on the weekends.

06:47.487 --> 06:49.478
Anyway, we don't get a lot
of people from New York.

06:49.556 --> 06:53.287
Well, this New Yorker bought a bus
ticket to Philadelphia last weekend,

06:53.359 --> 06:56.192
and he used to own a
robot just like that one.

06:56.262 --> 06:57.251
So what?

06:57.330 --> 06:59.798
"So what" is, you're the
only place on the east coast

06:59.866 --> 07:00.924
that has one
in stock.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.627
Could we see it?

07:05.972 --> 07:08.634
It's 10 grand.
It's mint, in the box.

07:10.577 --> 07:12.943
Someone tried
to erase it.

07:13.012 --> 07:16.846
Pierce wrote his initials in pencil
on the bottom of all his toys.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.441
You can still
make it out. See, AP.

07:19.519 --> 07:20.508
Where'd you get this?

07:20.587 --> 07:22.316
I bought it fair and
square from the owner.

07:22.388 --> 07:23.514
Who's that?

07:23.590 --> 07:25.581
I just moved to this location.
All of my records are...

07:25.658 --> 07:28.058
Hey. Johnny Seven.

07:29.996 --> 07:33.193
One Man Army. My brother
had one when I was a kid.

07:33.266 --> 07:37.202
He nearly took my eye out
with it. Seven weapons in one.

07:37.270 --> 07:40.671
One, grenade launcher.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.774
Hey, you'll
break something.

07:43.843 --> 07:45.640
You sure you don't
have those records?

07:45.712 --> 07:48.442
Two, anti-tank rocket.

07:51.050 --> 07:52.881
I'm going for a walk.

07:54.354 --> 07:57.551
Three,
armor-piercing shell.

08:00.326 --> 08:04.353
Okay. Maybe I have a record.
I don't know if it's in here.

08:04.430 --> 08:07.422
Four, anti-bunker missile.

08:08.168 --> 08:09.795
Here, I found it.

08:10.403 --> 08:12.428
Five, machine gun.

08:14.941 --> 08:19.878
Elizabeth Wexley. You paid her
$2,000 cash, the thing's worth 10.

08:19.946 --> 08:21.174
Nice profit margin.

08:21.247 --> 08:23.215
She wanted cash?

08:24.551 --> 08:27.987
And that didn't tip you off
that the robot was stolen?

08:29.589 --> 08:32.318
Six, repeater rifle.

08:32.392 --> 08:35.759
Okay, okay, so maybe I
should've been more careful.

08:35.828 --> 08:37.524
Pierce mention anything
about this girl?

08:37.597 --> 08:41.294
He asked if I bought the robot from
a girl. He said her name was Amanda.

08:41.366 --> 08:45.861
She lived in an apartment over on
East Barrington in the 200 block.

08:45.939 --> 08:49.670
No apartments on the 200
block. It's all commercial.

08:49.742 --> 08:51.937
That include
a mailbox store?

08:53.279 --> 08:57.147
No wonder he was angry.
She stole his robot.

08:58.051 --> 09:01.043
Well, don't get between
a guy and his toys.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.884
Seven, cap gun.

09:11.698 --> 09:15.293
I don't get it, Dorian, what
do you care about those people?

09:15.368 --> 09:18.337
You don't have to talk
to them. Just show up.

09:19.939 --> 09:22.032
Okay. I'll be there.

09:23.309 --> 09:28.679
Oh, before I forget, my uncle
found a restorer to do the work.

09:29.315 --> 09:31.408
But he said
it's expensive.

09:32.418 --> 09:33.908
How expensive?

09:34.687 --> 09:40.421
$8,000. I know it's a lot,
sweetie, but he works for a museum.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.949
Oh,

09:42.362 --> 09:46.560
and he has to be paid in
cash. Can you have it Friday?

09:46.633 --> 09:49.864
$8,000? I guess so.

09:49.936 --> 09:53.667
I'll tell my uncle.
And I'll see you Friday.

10:03.483 --> 10:07.886
She'll be here.
See, you misjudged her.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.857
Did he come
in last weekend?

10:15.929 --> 10:17.897
Yeah,
very confused man.

10:17.964 --> 10:20.398
I told him I didn't know
where Ms. Wexley lives.

10:21.968 --> 10:27.998
There's no personal mail, just a bunch
of newsletters from different fan clubs.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.635
You have
a package for her?

10:32.078 --> 10:35.946
Trekkies, mystery
weekend, Hobbit fairs...

10:36.015 --> 10:38.711
Life's just one big
fantasy for Ms. Wexley.

10:38.785 --> 10:42.186
It came in last week from
Grayson Fabrications in New York.

10:42.255 --> 10:44.849
She gets a lot
of packages from them.

10:54.167 --> 10:57.068
That would've given
Arnie a heart attack.

10:57.136 --> 10:59.468
It's definitely
not for Arnold.

10:59.539 --> 11:03.873
The design, it's sci-fi, but it's not
from the '50s and it's not for children.

11:07.313 --> 11:08.439
Yeah.

11:09.148 --> 11:14.176
It says next month in Miami, there's
a convention for H.R. Giger fans.

11:16.456 --> 11:19.391
Pictures here from
their masquerade ball.

11:19.459 --> 11:20.721
If she's looking
for a new sucker,

11:20.793 --> 11:22.886
she'd get a lot
of bites wearing that.

11:22.962 --> 11:23.951
That's what
this woman does.

11:24.030 --> 11:27.761
She trolls these conventions
for men like Arnold Pierce,

11:27.834 --> 11:30.166
then takes them
to the cleaners.

11:30.236 --> 11:35.333
Poor Arnie, his robots had more
heart than the woman of his dreams.

11:38.411 --> 11:41.141
It's one of the creations
I made for Elizabeth.

11:41.214 --> 11:43.944
We've talked on the phone.
Never actually met her.

11:44.017 --> 11:47.384
I have her measurements. She sends
me drawings of what she wants.

11:47.453 --> 11:49.648
What other creations
have you made for her?

11:49.722 --> 11:50.780
Hmm.

11:52.258 --> 11:56.695
Well, here are
her drawings,

11:58.131 --> 12:00.656
photos of the
finished costume...

12:00.733 --> 12:03.361
An outfit for every kind of fan club.

12:05.071 --> 12:08.370
This one she ordered for
the convention next month.

12:12.678 --> 12:16.409
This was ordered last summer.
It's from a '50s sci-fi movie.

12:17.450 --> 12:20.442
She probably used this
to get Arnie's attention.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.647
This one was ordered
just five months ago.

12:22.722 --> 12:24.986
The proportions
don't look right.

12:25.058 --> 12:28.425
Because it's a Parisian child's
dress sized up for an adult.

12:28.494 --> 12:30.223
And the sleeves
don't match.

12:30.296 --> 12:33.060
The basic dress is late
18th century neoclassical,

12:33.132 --> 12:35.600
but Elizabeth wanted something
Victorian for the sleeves,

12:35.668 --> 12:39.934
so I made them leg
o'mutton, circa 1890 London.

12:40.006 --> 12:44.841
It's been burned and patched
along the hem. Is that her design?

12:44.911 --> 12:47.471
Yes, to look like the wearer
had walked through a fire.

12:47.547 --> 12:48.980
The patch is raw cotton.

12:49.048 --> 12:53.678
Elizabeth wanted something from the
American South, at the end of the Civil War.

12:53.753 --> 12:55.880
Could you
excuse us, please?

12:59.959 --> 13:03.292
It took her six months
to clean out Arnold Pierce.

13:03.362 --> 13:05.125
This dress was ordered five months ago.

13:05.198 --> 13:09.828
Whoever she reeled in with it,
she may still be working him.

13:09.902 --> 13:12.996
We match this to a fan
club, maybe we find her.

13:14.006 --> 13:19.342
Each costume represents a specific
character from literature or the movies.

13:19.412 --> 13:23.576
A dress made with pieces from
three different time periods.

13:24.984 --> 13:27.885
For a little girl who
lived for 100 years

13:29.288 --> 13:30.949
and never grew up.

13:34.861 --> 13:36.920
<i>"The Ripper's Mask.</i>

13:36.996 --> 13:41.160
"Lord Fantomas battles Jack the Ripper
for the dark heart of Victorian London. "

13:41.234 --> 13:43.134
It's written
by Carlotta Francis.

13:43.202 --> 13:47.070
<i>Here's another one by her.
"Blood Magnolias.</i>

13:48.007 --> 13:50.066
"Lord Fantomas and his
merry band of vampires

13:50.143 --> 13:53.408
"are caught in Sherman's
March across Georgia. "

13:53.479 --> 13:56.971
<i>Her first novel,
"Darkness Takes a Daughter.</i>

13:57.049 --> 14:00.041
"Vampire Lord Fantomas, whose
journey begins in the elegant salons

14:00.119 --> 14:01.711
"of pre-revolutionary
Paris. "

14:01.787 --> 14:05.655
Paris, London, Georgia. Sounds
like we hit the trifecta.

14:08.027 --> 14:12.464
All the books, they have a
character named Rosalie Panet.

14:13.599 --> 14:16.067
She was 10 years old during
the French Revolution.

14:16.135 --> 14:21.767
When she was bitten by a vampire,
she became immortal and never aged.

14:21.874 --> 14:23.967
Rosalie's dress
tells her story.

14:24.043 --> 14:27.570
In the second novel, she and her
fellow vampires came to America.

14:27.647 --> 14:30.343
They're in Atlanta when
Sherman burned it down.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.680
That's why the dress is scorched.

14:32.752 --> 14:33.741
In the third novel,

14:33.819 --> 14:37.050
she's in London when she's
attacked by Jack the Ripper.

14:37.123 --> 14:39.853
She survived, but her dress was slashed.

14:39.926 --> 14:41.917
She had to
replace the sleeves.

14:41.994 --> 14:45.395
These were written in the '50s.
They still have a big following?

14:45.464 --> 14:48.297
Well, it doesn't hurt that
Carlotta Francis committed suicide

14:48.367 --> 14:50.267
when the last book
was published.

14:50.336 --> 14:53.100
If our lady con artist got
her dress four months ago,

14:53.172 --> 14:57.074
there must've been a fan convention
somewhere around that time.

14:58.644 --> 14:59.804
There was.

14:59.879 --> 15:02.609
Sponsored by the Carlotta
Francis Society of Manhattan.

15:02.682 --> 15:05.515
They have pictures
of their costume ball.

15:06.385 --> 15:08.615
We're looking
for a brunette.

15:10.856 --> 15:12.517
There's the dress.

15:12.592 --> 15:14.321
And that
looks like our girl.

15:17.730 --> 15:19.391
Vampire humor.

15:19.465 --> 15:22.901
Every Friday night, they hold
a wake at the Brooklyn Crypt.

15:22.969 --> 15:25.199
"New devotees welcome. "

15:27.707 --> 15:29.174
Captain Cobb.

15:29.742 --> 15:32.973
Captain Cobb of the Army
of the Confederate States.

15:33.045 --> 15:38.779
It's an honor to make your acquaintance,
sir. I'm Bob Goren. This is Alex.

15:40.286 --> 15:42.720
We just moved here
from Delaware.

15:43.789 --> 15:46.417
We saw your picture
in the newsletter.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.886
I really liked the costume that
you were wearing at the annual ball.

15:49.962 --> 15:52.089
I told Bob yours looked more authentic.

15:52.164 --> 15:54.655
He puts extra padding
you-know-where.

15:55.534 --> 15:58.264
I really like what
you did to your crypt.

15:58.337 --> 16:01.738
The fixtures are from our store,
Recovered Relics in Bay Ridge.

16:01.807 --> 16:03.468
I'm Ronette,
Parker's wife.

16:03.542 --> 16:07.273
Geez, I'm sorry. I always
forget to make the intros. And...

16:09.615 --> 16:10.877
Well, that was Iris.

16:10.950 --> 16:15.546
So, Bob and Alex, how long
have you been Carlotta fans?

16:15.621 --> 16:18.988
We really got into her
two years ago.

16:19.058 --> 16:22.459
Alex really clicked
into the Rosalie character.

16:22.528 --> 16:24.120
I mean, she can't
get the dress right.

16:24.196 --> 16:27.324
There was a girl
in a picture from the ball.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.665
Her Rosalie dress was
perfect. Is she here tonight?

16:31.671 --> 16:36.506
Becky Friel and Erlinda Gage
both have pretty good Rosalies.

16:36.575 --> 16:38.702
Becky's home with her kids.
They've got the flu.

16:38.778 --> 16:42.214
And Erlinda's on a business
trip to Michigan, I think.

16:42.281 --> 16:43.680
We don't know
any other Rosalies.

16:43.749 --> 16:46.013
Honey, we have to go.

16:46.085 --> 16:47.177
Okay.

16:48.287 --> 16:49.413
See you at
the next meeting.

16:49.488 --> 16:50.546
Okay.

16:53.092 --> 16:55.890
Guess who wears the
fangs in that family.

16:57.363 --> 16:58.762
Bloody Mary?

17:01.334 --> 17:04.201
You had that gorgeous
gown at the ball.

17:04.270 --> 17:06.932
You were the
Marquise De Verendrye.

17:07.006 --> 17:10.464
Yeah. Lord Fantomas's
first conquest.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.345
There was a girl
in the picture with you.

17:13.412 --> 17:15.743
Her Rosalie dress
was so perfect.

17:16.214 --> 17:17.944
I don't
remember her.

17:18.017 --> 17:20.212
They just moved here
from Delaware.

17:20.286 --> 17:21.377
Yeah.

17:21.454 --> 17:25.788
I don't remember there being a Carlotta
Society chapter down in Delaware.

17:25.858 --> 17:31.228
We're pretty much it. We read
our first Carlotta two years ago.

17:31.297 --> 17:33.322
You have so much
to learn.

17:36.268 --> 17:38.634
This is like high school
without the zits.

17:38.704 --> 17:39.762
Mmm-hmm.

17:46.145 --> 17:47.942
It's a black orchid.

17:50.549 --> 17:54.679
Black orchid is what Rosalie was
given when she became immortal.

17:54.754 --> 17:57.279
Someone was expecting
a Rosalie here tonight.

17:57.356 --> 17:59.017
Maybe our Rosalie.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.525
"Union Square Florists. "

18:05.131 --> 18:07.531
Black orchids
must be so rare.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.363
Florist said they
deliver a bouquet of them

18:09.435 --> 18:11.266
every other weekend
to Ms. Shapiro.

18:11.337 --> 18:13.396
Well, she's been coming here
for the last four months.

18:13.472 --> 18:14.769
Since she checked in
this afternoon,

18:14.840 --> 18:16.205
has there been
anybody up to see her?

18:16.275 --> 18:17.299
I think she's out.

18:17.376 --> 18:20.004
She hasn't made any calls
or ordered room service.

18:21.914 --> 18:24.815
Ms. Shapiro? It's the
front desk manager.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.485
Open it up.

18:37.129 --> 18:38.323
Clear.

18:45.271 --> 18:46.898
Bathroom's clear.

18:48.841 --> 18:50.240
There's our dress.

18:57.983 --> 19:00.281
My guess,
it's not a hope chest.

19:13.299 --> 19:14.732
It's her.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.930
Looks like our Rosalie found a box
she couldn't con her way out of.

19:22.141 --> 19:26.703
Well, so far, I can eliminate
most things except asphyxiation.

19:27.813 --> 19:29.144
Now, how he did it,
I couldn't tell you

19:29.215 --> 19:30.682
until we get her
back to the morgue.

19:30.749 --> 19:32.740
Locking her in a box
is a good start.

19:32.818 --> 19:36.379
Yeah, but the box isn't
airtight. She would've been okay.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.388
What do you
make of this?

19:44.330 --> 19:46.298
Looks like
freezer burn.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.661
Ice. Dry ice.

19:51.470 --> 19:54.564
They would have locked her in here with
a block of it, and when it dissolves,

19:54.640 --> 19:57.700
it would have filled
the box with carbon dioxide.

19:57.776 --> 20:01.610
Pushed out all the oxygen.
That's how she suffocated.

20:01.680 --> 20:06.014
In a box in the dark. The ultimate
Carlotta Francis experience.

20:08.988 --> 20:12.856
Her FBI prints got a hit.
Lori Purcell, 29.

20:12.925 --> 20:16.588
She took a collar from
Philadelphia PD for pros and drugs.

20:16.662 --> 20:18.425
It's the kind of background we'd expect.

20:18.497 --> 20:21.330
A low opinion of men,
ability to manipulate them.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.961
And how. She had over 300
grand in a bank account.

20:25.037 --> 20:26.868
That's probably how she
got her biggest thrills,

20:26.939 --> 20:31.273
to take what's most precious from
her marks, like Arnold's toy robot.

20:34.246 --> 20:35.770
Looks homemade.

20:37.883 --> 20:40.613
I think it was made to
fold up, to be carried.

20:40.686 --> 20:45.680
The killer was probably gonna
come back and leave her in the bed.

20:46.825 --> 20:50.727
Just another hotel guest who
died in her sleep, causes unknown.

20:51.697 --> 20:52.891
A smoke alarm?

20:52.965 --> 20:55.331
Carbon dioxide detector.

20:57.603 --> 20:59.628
Batteries are still there.

21:06.478 --> 21:08.036
A fan.

21:08.113 --> 21:10.138
And the wood
looks water damaged.

21:13.152 --> 21:14.710
All right.
So the detector

21:14.787 --> 21:17.779
senses when the carbon
dioxide level's too high,

21:17.856 --> 21:19.551
fan kicks in,
clears the air.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.456
A safety device?

21:21.527 --> 21:24.360
Maybe this thing wasn't
built to kill anybody.

21:26.131 --> 21:28.258
It's big enough
to fit two people.

21:30.235 --> 21:32.294
You know, in one
of the books,

21:32.371 --> 21:37.502
Rosalie's mother almost suffocates
buried alive with her lover.

21:40.112 --> 21:43.104
That's what this box
was designed to simulate.

21:43.816 --> 21:45.613
As it fills
with carbon dioxide,

21:45.684 --> 21:49.711
it acts as a form
of erotic asphyxiation.

21:49.788 --> 21:53.224
Whoever put the girl in here
must have disabled the fan.

21:57.596 --> 21:59.496
These hinges,
they look old to you?

21:59.565 --> 22:02.125
Old enough to be
a recovered relic.

22:06.438 --> 22:08.906
They were on a cedar chest we found.

22:08.974 --> 22:10.965
We'd love
to find more.

22:11.043 --> 22:12.271
I mean, they're probably
from a church, right?

22:12.344 --> 22:14.676
'Cause you see how the cross
is bonded onto the metal?

22:14.747 --> 22:16.578
You don't sell anything
like this here?

22:16.649 --> 22:19.675
I've never seen a hinge
with that design. Sorry.

22:19.752 --> 22:21.686
Willis, I'm going
upstairs for lunch.

22:21.754 --> 22:23.016
All right.

22:24.023 --> 22:25.923
Hey. Hey.
One more thing. Just...

22:25.991 --> 22:30.758
Do you remember that Rosalie
dress that we were asking about?

22:30.829 --> 22:33.798
Wow, look at
that doorknob.

22:36.135 --> 22:40.299
"Public School, City of New York.
" Is there another one of these?

22:41.473 --> 22:42.462
Hi, Ronette.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.736
Hi, Bob.
Hi, Alex.

22:47.479 --> 22:51.279
We had these knobs when
I was a kid at school.

22:51.350 --> 22:52.874
I thought you said
you were from Delaware.

22:52.951 --> 22:56.785
Little white lie. By the
way, we're detectives.

22:56.855 --> 23:02.623
We identified the girl in the
Rosalie dress at your costume ball.

23:03.629 --> 23:06.359
She went by the name
of Jocelyn or Lori.

23:06.432 --> 23:08.457
We had a little too
much wine that night.

23:08.534 --> 23:11.401
You should've seen Parker,
he gets red like a fire truck.

23:11.470 --> 23:14.303
What about the single
guys at your chapter?

23:14.373 --> 23:15.931
Maybe one of them
got to know her.

23:16.008 --> 23:19.239
There's plenty of gals in the chapter.
The guys don't have to look outside.

23:19.311 --> 23:21.609
What's the deal with this
girl? Are you looking for her?

23:21.680 --> 23:25.707
We found her in a box
in a hotel room, dead.

23:26.452 --> 23:28.920
That's... That's awful.

23:30.322 --> 23:32.984
Nice collection
of Carlotta books.

23:35.561 --> 23:37.256
Do you have
any first editions?

23:37.329 --> 23:39.354
No. They're
too expensive.

23:40.499 --> 23:42.660
Well, I mean,
if you had a set,

23:42.735 --> 23:44.293
they'd be the centerpiece
of your collection, right?

23:44.369 --> 23:49.534
Anybody in your chapter
have a first edition?

23:49.975 --> 23:52.205
Only Dorian,
Dorian Cavanaugh.

23:52.277 --> 23:53.369
He has a real nice one.

23:53.445 --> 23:55.572
Mint condition,
with the dust jackets.

23:55.647 --> 23:57.171
Must've cost him
a fortune.

23:57.249 --> 23:59.877
Does his wife mind him
spending so much on books?

23:59.952 --> 24:01.749
Dorian's not married.

24:08.761 --> 24:11.730
Jocelyn Shapiro? Yes, I know
her. Why, is she all right?

24:11.797 --> 24:13.230
You're her boyfriend?

24:13.298 --> 24:15.357
I'm... Well, we've been
dating the last four months,

24:15.434 --> 24:17.698
but she lives
in Philadelphia.

24:17.770 --> 24:20.432
We were supposed to meet on Friday
night, but she didn't show up.

24:20.506 --> 24:21.700
What's happened?

24:22.474 --> 24:26.001
She was found dead in her
hotel room Friday night.

24:28.614 --> 24:30.946
We're very sorry,
Mr. Cavanaugh.

24:32.818 --> 24:35.810
We have to ask, had you
been giving her money?

24:37.656 --> 24:41.057
A few thousand dollars.
She lost her job.

24:43.061 --> 24:45.188
You have a collection
of books.

24:46.398 --> 24:48.298
Carlotta Francis books.

24:49.168 --> 24:52.968
I belong to
a kind of fan club.

24:53.438 --> 24:57.169
This empty space, that's where
you keep your first editions?

24:58.110 --> 25:01.910
You lent them
to someone?

25:05.417 --> 25:06.645
Jocelyn?

25:07.352 --> 25:10.082
She has an uncle in the
antiquarian book business.

25:10.155 --> 25:12.146
He was appraising them.
Why?

25:12.224 --> 25:16.285
Jocelyn's real name is Lori
Purcell. She was a con artist.

25:16.361 --> 25:18.852
She scammed men she
met at fan conventions

25:18.931 --> 25:21.365
for their money
and their collections.

25:21.433 --> 25:26.200
That's not possible. Jocelyn wasn't
like that. She had feelings for me.

25:27.973 --> 25:31.807
Before you were supposed
to meet her, where were you?

25:31.877 --> 25:36.041
I was at work. I write copy
for an advertising company.

25:37.950 --> 25:42.319
I was running late. I called
my friend Parker to get a ride.

25:43.222 --> 25:46.714
But he and his wife Ronette
weren't home, so I got a cab.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.727
I bought flowers
for Jocelyn.

25:50.629 --> 25:52.119
Then I went
to The Crypt.

25:52.197 --> 25:55.223
Parker and Ronette,
were they there?

25:56.034 --> 25:58.195
They arrived
a little later.

25:58.270 --> 26:00.170
They know about
you and Jocelyn?

26:00.239 --> 26:04.573
Sure. It was kind
of a problem.

26:05.110 --> 26:06.702
They didn't like her?

26:06.778 --> 26:12.774
They're good people. They just
kept calling her Josephine.

26:13.085 --> 26:19.649
In the books, the vampire Morpheus
fell in love with Josephine,

26:19.725 --> 26:24.219
so much in love, he refused
to make her a vampire.

26:24.296 --> 26:25.661
Am I getting this right?

26:25.731 --> 26:29.667
He didn't want to share with
the other children of the night.

26:29.735 --> 26:34.001
Parker expected you to
share Jocelyn, sexually?

26:35.173 --> 26:38.506
Parker and Ronette
can get weird.

26:39.278 --> 26:42.714
Jocelyn and I
hadn't even... Not yet.

26:43.348 --> 26:46.784
I wanted things to be
just between us.

26:47.452 --> 26:51.684
Is erotic asphyxiation one of the
things Parker and Ronette are into?

26:52.457 --> 26:54.220
It's from the books.

26:58.697 --> 27:02.258
They use special equipment,
maybe a box like that?

27:03.635 --> 27:05.125
They built it.

27:05.570 --> 27:06.628
Where did you
get this?

27:06.705 --> 27:08.764
We found
Jocelyn in it.

27:12.010 --> 27:13.375
Parker and Ronette
aren't here.

27:13.445 --> 27:16.676
What about last Friday afternoon,
Mr. Willis, were they here?

27:16.748 --> 27:20.411
No, Parker went to look at
a hotel they're tearing down.

27:20.485 --> 27:22.817
Looks like you
stepped in water.

27:29.661 --> 27:31.652
You got a leak
back here?

27:32.397 --> 27:34.661
We have a drainage problem back here.

27:35.701 --> 27:38.864
We had a wooden box
that was water damaged.

27:38.937 --> 27:41.929
Hey, what was
in this spot here?

27:42.007 --> 27:45.568
Some pieces of painted wood.
Not sure what they were for.

27:47.145 --> 27:48.305
It's red satin.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.314
I'll call CSU.

27:50.382 --> 27:53.317
Parker, did he take anything
from here last Friday?

27:53.385 --> 27:54.545
No, not Friday.

27:54.619 --> 27:58.953
They were here Thursday with their friends
from that vampire club they belong to.

28:00.826 --> 28:02.817
This woman,
was she here?

28:02.894 --> 28:05.692
Yeah, and her boyfriend,
with the beard.

28:07.232 --> 28:08.426
On their way.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.402
It's not just Parker, it's the
whole gang. They all killed her.

28:15.807 --> 28:20.801
The police are at the store.
They're searching the place.

28:22.481 --> 28:23.812
It was an
accident, Dorian.

28:23.882 --> 28:26.077
We were just looking out for you.

28:26.151 --> 28:28.745
Now it's your turn
to look out for us.

28:37.763 --> 28:38.957
Everybody knows
about the box.

28:39.031 --> 28:40.089
People are always
borrowing it.

28:40.165 --> 28:42.065
I don't know
who had it last.

28:42.134 --> 28:46.127
Well, what's it like going in there,
getting hot and heavy with your girl?

28:47.039 --> 28:49.439
You know,
feeling yourself choke?

28:50.042 --> 28:52.101
It's an incredible feeling.

28:52.177 --> 28:53.940
Half the people in the
chapter use the box,

28:54.012 --> 28:56.412
and not always
with the same person.

28:56.481 --> 28:59.006
This experience,
it builds trust?

28:59.084 --> 29:03.043
And it helps us understand Carlotta's
characters at a deeper level.

29:03.121 --> 29:04.850
Characters
like Morpheus?

29:04.923 --> 29:07.357
If one of your friends didn't
want to share his girlfriend,

29:07.426 --> 29:10.156
would that make
the rest of you unhappy?

29:10.762 --> 29:14.596
"Josephine," that's what you
called Dorian's girlfriend.

29:14.666 --> 29:17.794
Now, you all thought that she
was pulling him away from you.

29:17.869 --> 29:19.734
We didn't even know
he was seeing her.

29:20.305 --> 29:22.034
That's not what
Dorian told us.

29:22.107 --> 29:25.099
You knew that she was
coming to the meeting Friday.

29:25.177 --> 29:28.544
Instead, you and Ronette
were waiting for her

29:28.613 --> 29:33.448
Friday afternoon, at her
hotel, with the welcome wagon.

29:34.252 --> 29:36.186
I was in Tarrytown
Friday, all day,

29:36.254 --> 29:37.778
bidding on the fixtures
of an old hotel.

29:37.856 --> 29:40.051
The people there
all know me.

29:41.626 --> 29:43.457
Names and numbers.

29:46.331 --> 29:49.198
Our little dumplings are
sticking to their story.

29:49.267 --> 29:52.293
Any evidence on this death
box to contradict them?

29:52.370 --> 29:56.170
Latent found over two dozen
fingerprints on the outside of the box.

29:56.241 --> 29:57.469
That thing got
quite the workout.

29:57.542 --> 29:58.975
Well, apparently so.

29:59.044 --> 30:01.979
The fan didn't go on because
the carbon dioxide detector

30:02.047 --> 30:05.881
had become desensitized
from over-exposure to CO2.

30:05.951 --> 30:07.418
It wore out.

30:07.486 --> 30:11.422
Well, they would've needed a car
to carry the box to the hotel.

30:13.258 --> 30:15.852
Parker's alibi will
probably hold up.

30:16.928 --> 30:20.921
Ronette doesn't have a
license. Neither does Iris.

30:22.234 --> 30:24.361
Carl Rosenman does.

30:24.436 --> 30:25.869
This is
private property.

30:25.937 --> 30:28.132
That's why we have
a search warrant.

30:30.308 --> 30:31.775
You should really
get this lock fixed.

30:31.843 --> 30:34.368
I mean, anybody could
just climb right in.

30:34.446 --> 30:38.348
This is really embarrassing. My
mom is watching from her window.

30:38.416 --> 30:42.750
I don't remember Carlotta's
vampires living off their parents.

30:48.827 --> 30:50.624
What's that?
Not sure.

30:51.029 --> 30:53.862
It just fell out of
last Thursday's paper.

30:57.035 --> 31:01.563
Isn't "carbonics" a fancy
name for dry ice supplier?

31:03.475 --> 31:05.272
Okay. Okay.

31:05.877 --> 31:08.311
So you know about Parker's love box.

31:08.880 --> 31:13.010
Look, me and Iris did a couple laps
in it last month over at The Crypt.

31:13.084 --> 31:14.779
We left it there
when we were done.

31:14.853 --> 31:18.812
You sure you didn't leave it at the
hotel last Friday with a body in it?

31:18.890 --> 31:23.156
No. Last Friday after work,
I had a hook up with Iris.

31:23.228 --> 31:25.594
She has roommates
and my mom's here all day,

31:25.664 --> 31:28.565
so we borrowed Dorian's
place. You can check it out.

31:29.568 --> 31:32.002
I lent them my keys. I wasn't
going to be home anyway.

31:32.070 --> 31:35.005
The sheets that they used,
did you wash them?

31:36.541 --> 31:38.668
They're still
in the hamper.

31:40.078 --> 31:43.138
You run a hot-sheet motel
for all your friends?

31:43.882 --> 31:45.907
They'd do
the same for me.

31:46.451 --> 31:47.577
Would they
kill Jocelyn

31:47.652 --> 31:49.643
if they thought that she
was taking advantage of you?

31:49.721 --> 31:51.916
I can't think
they did that.

31:54.826 --> 31:58.193
Okay, I've got semen
and pubic hair.

31:59.531 --> 32:02.364
I guess your friends
were here after all.

32:07.405 --> 32:09.134
Lights on in there.

32:15.146 --> 32:17.114
When did
you wash these?

32:17.882 --> 32:19.213
Yesterday.

32:19.651 --> 32:23.314
You washed them, but you didn't
wash the sheets Carl and Iris used?

32:24.923 --> 32:28.723
They gave you the semen and the
hairs to smear on the sheets?

32:29.227 --> 32:32.128
Dorian, people that ask you
to do something like that,

32:32.197 --> 32:34.529
they're not really
your friends.

32:40.505 --> 32:45.408
As Mr. Cavanaugh's statement makes clear,
he was asked to falsify alibi evidence.

32:45.477 --> 32:47.775
There's only one
conclusion a jury will draw.

32:47.846 --> 32:49.711
Before you jump
to that conclusion,

32:49.781 --> 32:53.615
our clients have another
explanation to offer, off the record.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.683
We just wanted
to scare her.

32:57.756 --> 32:59.223
Carl and Iris put
her in the box,

32:59.291 --> 33:03.523
then when we came back later to let
her out, we saw the police there.

33:03.595 --> 33:05.187
We wanted her to
leave Dorian alone.

33:05.263 --> 33:09.359
You locked her in a closed box
with a block of carbon dioxide?

33:09.434 --> 33:12.767
We've been in the box dozens of
times. The fan's always kicked in.

33:12.837 --> 33:15.704
We tested it before we
loaded it into my van.

33:15.774 --> 33:16.900
We put new
batteries in it...

33:16.975 --> 33:18.272
How did you
test it?

33:18.343 --> 33:21.278
With some dry ice. Everything
worked. It was an accident.

33:21.346 --> 33:24.372
If you just wanted to scare her,
why not report her to the police?

33:24.449 --> 33:25.939
She's stealing
from your friends.

33:26.017 --> 33:29.077
Dorian gave her money,
that's not stealing.

33:29.154 --> 33:31.281
She took
his first editions.

33:31.756 --> 33:33.917
The Carlotta
first editions.

33:34.726 --> 33:37.559
Dorian lent them to her a month
ago. She never returned them.

33:37.629 --> 33:40.427
He never let those books out of his
sight. I can't believe he'd do that.

33:40.498 --> 33:42.193
They're like
the Holy Grail.

33:42.267 --> 33:44.565
He was the only one in our
chapter with the whole set.

33:44.636 --> 33:46.467
Mr. Carver,
there's no intent here.

33:46.538 --> 33:49.006
At most, our clients
were reckless.

33:50.809 --> 33:53.243
Mr. Stronach,
I'll get back to you.

34:03.188 --> 34:04.951
The batteries
did look new.

34:05.023 --> 34:06.786
You wouldn't put
new batteries in

34:06.858 --> 34:09.257
if you didn't want
the thing to work.

34:09.327 --> 34:11.318
Maybe it was
an accident.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.496
Maybe it wasn't.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.563
We need to subpoena
Dorian's financials,

34:19.971 --> 34:23.407
see what other secrets he
kept from his loyal friends.

34:24.342 --> 34:25.775
Three days
before Jocelyn died,

34:25.844 --> 34:28.938
Dorian applied for
an $8,000 personal loan.

34:29.013 --> 34:31.139
His bank
turned him down.

34:31.216 --> 34:35.016
She already had his books, the
centerpiece of his collection.

34:37.121 --> 34:40.558
I mean, going by her MO,
the game should've been over.

34:41.993 --> 34:44.985
Look, these are
estimate forms

34:45.063 --> 34:47.623
from an antiquarian
book restorer.

34:47.699 --> 34:50.827
Philadelphia PD found them
in Jocelyn's apartment.

34:50.902 --> 34:53.768
Looks like
she made copies

34:53.838 --> 34:56.705
and covered up the
original name and address.

34:56.775 --> 35:00.040
The middle step in
creating a bogus estimate.

35:00.812 --> 35:03.178
$8,000 to repair books.

35:04.215 --> 35:06.911
She'd need other props
to run this con.

35:07.786 --> 35:09.014
Mmm-hmm.

35:12.190 --> 35:17.253
There's a receipt here for a
picture from an online photo service.

35:21.699 --> 35:23.894
Here's the picture
Jocelyn bought,

35:23.968 --> 35:26.528
the inside of
a burned-out bookstore.

35:27.505 --> 35:30.099
She was playing him
for one last con.

35:30.775 --> 35:33.369
What if Dorian figured out
that she was conning him,

35:33.445 --> 35:35.379
and he decided to do
something about it?

35:35.447 --> 35:38.143
And let his loyal friends
take the rap?

35:39.484 --> 35:41.816
We need an
antiquarian bookseller.

35:41.886 --> 35:44.116
Imagine Dorian's
disappointment

35:44.856 --> 35:47.757
if he found out that
she wasn't playing him.

35:58.369 --> 36:02.396
So, this is your clubhouse.
Very unusual decor.

36:02.474 --> 36:04.738
Yeah, you almost forget you're
in the middle of Brooklyn.

36:04.809 --> 36:06.709
Mr. Carver, I don't see
why this is necessary.

36:06.778 --> 36:09.212
I'm trying to understand
your clients' state of mind.

36:16.287 --> 36:18.812
I got a message you
wanted me to meet you here.

36:18.890 --> 36:23.088
Guess we gave you the wrong time.
Why don't you come in anyway?

36:24.729 --> 36:26.196
Have a seat.

36:34.806 --> 36:38.742
Well, we're figuring out how
your friends got the notion that

36:38.810 --> 36:42.075
Jocelyn was trying to take
you away from all this.

36:42.146 --> 36:43.670
That's what
you all thought, right?

36:43.748 --> 36:46.683
Dorian practically stopped spending
time with us after he met her.

36:46.751 --> 36:48.981
No, Dorian said
that was his idea.

36:49.053 --> 36:50.611
No, it was hers.

36:50.688 --> 36:54.419
If she really cared about you,
she would've joined the group.

36:54.492 --> 36:56.585
Your friends
sound sincere.

36:57.061 --> 37:01.122
Maybe I did allow myself to
get too wrapped up in Jocelyn.

37:01.199 --> 37:05.602
Well, I guess that's how she got
you to give her all your money.

37:06.538 --> 37:09.371
Now that I know she conned all
those guys, I feel a little stupid.

37:09.440 --> 37:12.238
Don't say that, man.
We feel bad for you.

37:13.344 --> 37:17.178
They told us how you gave her
the Carlotta first edition.

37:18.316 --> 37:22.753
Yeah. Well, you were
embarrassed about that, right?

37:22.820 --> 37:26.551
I felt like such a loser.

37:26.624 --> 37:27.818
You're not a loser.

37:27.892 --> 37:30.759
Hey, after you told us about the books,

37:30.828 --> 37:33.126
we did a trace for
Jocelyn's uncle.

37:33.197 --> 37:35.427
Turns out
she has four uncles.

37:35.500 --> 37:41.029
One of whom, Larry Purcell, is an
antique book dealer in Baltimore.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.934
And we called him.
He had your books.

37:47.312 --> 37:50.770
Now, if they look like
they've been burned in a fire,

37:50.848 --> 37:53.112
it's, well, because they
were burned up in a store.

37:53.184 --> 37:54.651
But he said
they could be restored.

37:54.719 --> 37:58.621
And he sent us a copy of
an estimate for 8,000 bucks.

38:02.694 --> 38:05.720
Sorry. These...
It's evidence.

38:07.332 --> 38:10.233
But Mr. Purcell told us that Jocelyn
was supposed to talk to you about it.

38:10.301 --> 38:11.325
She didn't?

38:11.402 --> 38:13.336
You said
she was a con artist.

38:13.404 --> 38:17.966
Yeah, well, even con artists
tell the truth some of the time.

38:18.042 --> 38:20.010
Mr. Purcell told us
something else.

38:20.078 --> 38:23.104
Jocelyn was planning
to move to New York.

38:23.181 --> 38:27.948
She said she had met a real
great guy, an advertising writer,

38:28.019 --> 38:32.046
and in spite of herself, she
had really fallen for the guy.

38:32.123 --> 38:35.217
Sounds like you made an
honest woman out of her.

38:35.727 --> 38:38.252
Somebody made
a tragic mistake here.

38:39.430 --> 38:42.160
Yeah, someone should've
talked to Jocelyn

38:43.101 --> 38:45.399
before they locked her
in a box.

38:49.407 --> 38:52.808
You idiots! You idiots! I never
should have listened to you!

38:52.877 --> 38:55.641
Dorian, we're sorry.
We were thinking of you.

38:55.713 --> 38:58.944
You said she was using
me. I believed you.

38:59.751 --> 39:03.084
She loved me
and you killed her.

39:03.154 --> 39:04.781
No, no, no,
it was an accident.

39:04.856 --> 39:08.417
No, she's right. As stupid
as it was, it was an accident.

39:09.293 --> 39:11.818
No. They meant to kill her.

39:11.896 --> 39:15.093
No, see, they told us. They
checked the fan and the detector.

39:15.166 --> 39:16.224
They're lying.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.962
They wanted her dead. They
made threats against her.

39:19.037 --> 39:20.800
Dorian, what are
you saying, man?

39:20.872 --> 39:22.669
Look, we understand
that you're angry.

39:22.740 --> 39:25.004
Jocelyn was in love
with you, yeah,

39:25.076 --> 39:26.407
but we checked
that thing.

39:26.477 --> 39:29.674
Batteries were new, the
wires, they were good.

39:29.747 --> 39:32.580
Something must have
just been knocked off.

39:32.650 --> 39:34.208
They want you to think
it was an accident,

39:34.285 --> 39:36.310
but they know how you
can rig the detector

39:36.387 --> 39:39.788
so it won't turn the fan on if
you expose it to too much gas.

39:39.857 --> 39:43.384
How? By waving dry ice in
front of it till it wears out?

39:43.461 --> 39:44.553
That's a lot of dry ice.

39:44.629 --> 39:47.462
They used something...
I...

39:47.532 --> 39:51.093
I don't know what. Something
else with carbon dioxide.

39:54.572 --> 39:55.766
I know.

39:57.108 --> 40:00.635
My father used to use them
on old seltzer bottles.

40:02.313 --> 40:05.578
Something just like this.
It's full of carbon dioxide.

40:05.650 --> 40:08.141
I don't know.
That could be it.

40:08.219 --> 40:10.312
No, we think
this is it.

40:13.224 --> 40:16.250
We found a cap
in Carl's van.

40:16.327 --> 40:17.589
I didn't do it.

40:17.662 --> 40:18.686
We know you didn't.

40:18.763 --> 40:21.425
Because we found a big
fat thumbprint on this

40:21.499 --> 40:23.194
and it didn't
belong to you.

40:23.267 --> 40:26.361
It's funny how you knew somebody
tampered with the detector.

40:26.437 --> 40:30.237
Parker's assistant Willis told
us you dropped by last Thursday,

40:30.308 --> 40:32.173
just after Parker
and the rest of the gang

40:32.243 --> 40:34.803
had taken the box
out of the storage room.

40:34.879 --> 40:38.280
You saw that the box was
missing, and you figured out

40:38.349 --> 40:44.515
what kind of reception they were
planning for your beloved Jocelyn.

40:47.425 --> 40:50.826
And so, you bought one
of these at a party store.

40:53.197 --> 40:56.360
You went to Carl's because
his van has a broken lock.

40:56.434 --> 40:58.732
Dorian, you did it?
You killed her?

40:58.803 --> 41:01.203
Shut up!
Shut up, you loser!

41:01.272 --> 41:02.864
Yeah, they're
all losers, right?

41:02.940 --> 41:06.876
But you had Jocelyn, who, for a brief
moment, she made you feel like...

41:06.944 --> 41:08.741
Like someone special.

41:10.248 --> 41:13.149
Until she hit you up for the eight
grand and the bank turned you down.

41:13.217 --> 41:17.347
Is that when the light bulb went
on, saw what your life really was?

41:17.755 --> 41:21.020
The life of a loser pretending
to be little vampires,

41:21.092 --> 41:22.684
hanging out
in your vampire crypt...

41:22.760 --> 41:23.749
Stop it.

41:23.828 --> 41:25.557
...discussing your
vampire books,

41:25.630 --> 41:29.623
having sad vampire sex
in a plywood vampire box...

41:29.700 --> 41:30.928
Stop it!

41:34.038 --> 41:35.903
You were angry at her,

41:37.542 --> 41:40.033
but you got enraged
at them.

41:41.979 --> 41:45.676
Because they are everything
that you loathe about yourself.

41:46.450 --> 41:49.385
You know, they sucked
your identity from you.

41:49.687 --> 41:53.953
They made you easy prey for
just a promise of intimacy,

41:54.025 --> 41:59.486
just a promise of anyone to
help you reclaim your uniqueness.

42:00.131 --> 42:03.623
So you took this and destroyed
them, you destroyed her.

42:09.106 --> 42:13.167
And now your whole life,
up in vapor.

42:25.256 --> 42:27.622
That's what you did,
didn't you?

42:36.133 --> 42:37.225
Yes.

42:42.039 --> 42:45.975
I didn't know she really
loved me. I didn't...

42:47.345 --> 42:49.506
You're
under arrest, Dorian.

43:05.730 --> 43:07.789
When you going to
tell him the truth?

43:09.133 --> 43:10.623
I think he knows
the truth.

43:12.436 --> 43:14.461
Fantasy
they can't handle.
