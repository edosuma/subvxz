00:28.640 --> 00:29.760
Do you want to go in first?

00:33.320 --> 00:35.120
I want to film their reaction.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.640
Everybody, Pippa's here!

00:42.720 --> 00:46.280
- Oh, Mummy.
- Is she staying here?

00:46.360 --> 00:48.480
- Yes.
- New baby sister.

00:52.120 --> 00:56.200
My dad used to think Pippa was
what finally completed the whole family.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.400
He was like, "Seven colors of the rainbow,
seven wonders of the world..."

01:02.960 --> 01:07.800
He just had it fixated in his head
that Pippa was lucky.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.160
- Is she really at home?
- She's at home now, forever.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.640
We are going to take care of you so much.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.680
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

02:18.760 --> 02:22.280
Is there anything you want to say,
before I turn the camera off, Jamie?

02:22.360 --> 02:25.680
- Well, I'd like to ask you something.
- Is there anything you'd like to say?

02:25.760 --> 02:27.400
- Oh, that's good.
- Okay?

02:27.480 --> 02:28.760
I like that. That's good initiative.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.080
- Right.
- Right.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.200
- I'm gonna ask you to...
- Let me see you on the screen, Jamie.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.280
What I'm doing, Jamie,

02:36.360 --> 02:39.600
is I've recorded you
on your fourth birthday,

02:39.680 --> 02:41.640
fifth, sixth and now
your seventh tomorrow.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.200
This is like a little diary for you
when you're older.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.320
And I hope you'll be pleased with Daddy.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.240
You look beautiful, sweetheart.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.200
I love that this is my home
and I grew up here.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.800
We are all so close.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.560
Give us a nice smile,
Kacie.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.920
Everyone's kind of weird.
There's no such thing as normal.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.520
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.400
Mirie is the best twin ever.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.720
So is Lorie,
but in a different way.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.280
Oh, doesn't she look gorgeous.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.640
We're a handful.
I admire Mum for sticking around

03:28.720 --> 03:30.760
and not leaving us.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.080
We genuinely have
the best family in the world.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.880
Give us a smile.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.880
You see programs,
it's one big happy family.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.520
That's only on programs.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.480
There's seven of you,
we live in a wonderful house...

04:04.760 --> 04:06.360
have a wonderful time...

04:06.920 --> 04:09.800
and you have all got a very bright future.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.320
Hi, Lorie in the future,
Jamie in the future...

04:17.399 --> 04:18.880
And everyone in the future.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.440
I think
we're all so used to saying...

04:23.520 --> 04:25.800
For six years,
we've been saying we're okay.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
But there are some days
that I'm like, "It's not okay.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.960
I'm not fine about what happened."

04:35.280 --> 04:38.760
- Hello, Mummy.
- Hello, Daddy.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.840
Oh.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.880
Jamie, come here
with Daddy now, please.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.320
Please. Quickly, 'cause he's driving up.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.120
How about we have,
like, a ceremony?

05:51.200 --> 05:54.200
- Around the caravan?
- No, but do you know what I mean...

05:54.280 --> 05:56.240
- I didn't mean...
- I wasn't being sarcastic.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.680
We could all make our peace with
the caravan and say goodbye to it nicely.

06:00.760 --> 06:06.040
I personally feel as though we've all
moved on in our lives far enough,

06:06.120 --> 06:07.800
that it can go.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.720
- Don't you agree?
- The Atlas.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.000
- The Atlas, darling.
- Mum, this is one of those,

06:13.080 --> 06:14.360
"I'm only 13."

06:14.440 --> 06:16.280
But it's just sitting there.

06:16.360 --> 06:21.080
It's going to get to the point
where it'll just be completely derelict.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.880
- Mum, can I suggest something?
- Yes, darling.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.560
There was, um, this Buddhist idea

06:25.640 --> 06:29.360
that if you imagine all your beloved
belongings being broken and gone,

06:29.440 --> 06:32.120
when it actually goes, it's not as sad.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.680
Because you've already accepted the fact
that it's broken.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.400
Okay, that's not true.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.160
So, why don't you imagine that it's gone,

06:40.240 --> 06:42.960
imagine that tomorrow
they're taking it away,

06:43.040 --> 06:46.040
and imagine it's gone,
and see if you can deal with that.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.080
- I would personally feel like...
- Have you ever tried it?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.240
I would feel like a weight had been
partially lifted off my shoulders

06:51.320 --> 06:52.640
with the Atlas.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.680
I know that sounds really bad,

06:54.760 --> 06:57.880
but I used to look out there,
and if I saw all the lights on,

06:57.960 --> 06:59.720
I'd be crapping myself.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.840
I would feel like
we were giving up.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.000
I'd feel like we'd be just accepting
that he's gone.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.600
- And I just... Mum, stop...
- Do you not feel...

07:07.680 --> 07:10.000
- Let me finish!
- Sorry.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.720
You got to remember that
there's eight of us,

07:11.800 --> 07:14.760
and we are all in different stages.
We're not moving forward together.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.320
I do not feel that if we got rid of it,
it would help me to move on.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.520
I feel that it would mean that actually...

07:21.600 --> 07:25.800
If Dad... I know it sounds stupid,
but if Dad did come back,

07:25.880 --> 07:27.400
he would have nowhere to stay.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.040
When you first met Dad,
did you realize he was the way he was?

07:41.440 --> 07:45.240
I just thought he was very, um...
organized.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.920
- Was he handsome?
- And very... He was handsome, yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.240
- He was good fun.
- Why did Dad write everything down?

07:53.320 --> 07:56.440
Some days, he'd write nothing,
and other days, he'd write 20 pages.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.760
Would it be one extreme or the other?

07:58.840 --> 08:02.160
Would it ever be about five pages?
Or was it none or 20?

08:02.240 --> 08:03.720
No, it was one extreme or the other.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.600
- So, could he never be...
- Moderate.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.680
You know when you're not
quite happy or you're sad?

08:08.760 --> 08:11.720
He could never be in between?

08:11.800 --> 08:14.120
No, he was always one end or the other.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.080
Which was most common?

08:16.160 --> 08:20.000
When we first met,
probably the happier end.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.200
- And then did it get worse over time?
- Yeah.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.280
Gradually, over time, it switched.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.400
How long did it take you to notice
that he was getting worse?

08:27.960 --> 08:33.120
I think I realized how bad it was getting
around the time Pippa was born.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.679
But before then, you couldn't really
notice that he was getting worse?

08:36.760 --> 08:38.360
Is it as bad as you thought it was?

08:38.440 --> 08:39.880
- You see where the door is there?
- Yeah.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.520
If you step too close to it,
you can almost fall through.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.760
- The floor is almost breaking.
- Yeah. I don't know.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.120
- I think it's...
- No one could live in here either.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.920
We're not saying
we want to live in here.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.960
Pippi, look.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.880
Yeah? Mum, anything is going to break
if you snap it like that.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.760
No, Pippi, it's not.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.760
Oh, Mum, we can't get rid of this.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.280
You're imagining that it's nice.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.440
If we fixed it up a little bit,
I will come up here almost every day.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.720
- What would you do here?
- And do what?

09:12.800 --> 09:16.520
Homework? Be on my own? I don't know,
Niki used to write songs in here.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.200
- Right, Pipsy.
- Yeah?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.440
I feel like my dad was just...

09:48.000 --> 09:50.720
He wasn't real,
he was just someone I made up.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.960
- Pipsy, hello.
- Hello.

09:54.040 --> 09:58.280
I don't actually have any memories of him.
I've just heard stories.

09:59.280 --> 10:04.600
And I have made memories,
that I wasn't actually there.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.560
Let's see.

10:28.360 --> 10:33.280
I am trying to work out these chords
to play on the piano

10:33.360 --> 10:35.080
so I can do my dad's song.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.880
This song is called "A Perfect World."

10:41.200 --> 10:42.360
And it's beautiful.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.640
I think it's because...

10:47.480 --> 10:52.800
my dad had an idea
of what a perfect world would be.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.800
And I think that at one point
he had that with my mum.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.120
The song's about my mum.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.800
It restores my faith in love
and happiness.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.240
It's really nice.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.640

11:17.240 --> 11:21.400

11:55.200 --> 11:57.800

What a joy.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.040
They're an absolute joy, they are.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.000
The birds are in full song as usual.

12:12.560 --> 12:17.000
What exciting times,
creating a beautiful garden...

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
giving the children a safe environment.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.040
Kacie, are you excited
about your first day of school?

12:24.760 --> 12:26.360
Good. I hope you have a lovely day.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.280
God, not only are they coping,
they've videoed the whole bloody thing.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.600
Oh, look at that! Aw.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.040
I remember when we were younger,

12:39.120 --> 12:41.640
we used to put on shows and stuff
for Mum and Dad.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.360
We used to put up posters,
"Show tonight at 5:00."

12:45.440 --> 12:48.520
- Hello and welcome to today's show.
- Aw.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.560
Dad used to go around the table
and say what he thought

12:52.640 --> 12:55.040
everyone would be doing
when we've grown up.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.720
He always said I was good with a rhythm.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.040
Did Dad want Osborn
to be an astronaut?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.720
Daddy, wave at the camera
and say, "Yes."

13:03.800 --> 13:05.200
Yes.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.000
I'd like to thank my dad
with all my heart.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.160
And the work that he's done.
I mean, look.

13:14.080 --> 13:20.480
Right now,
I'm walking on the most brilliant mud.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.720
My dad is the best dad
in the whole wold.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.800
Tell you what,
most kids don't have a dad like mine.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.320
I'm so lucky.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.720
When Mum told us,

13:36.800 --> 13:39.160
you don't know how to take it.
You just scream.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.680
The way that the death happened
wasn't an accident.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.640
It was, like, his choice.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.480
It might've been a cry for help,
which makes me really sad.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.560
'Cause I can just imagine him,
being sat down there...

13:54.200 --> 13:56.760
I've constantly gone through
the what-ifs that day.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.800
What if I could have run into the woods,
maybe tried to find him?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.760
There was a banging at the door.
It was the police.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.840
They said, "We just had a call
from your husband

14:04.920 --> 14:06.880
saying he was going to kill himself."

14:06.960 --> 14:09.400
- I saw helicopters going around...
- Police vehicles arriving...

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
...ambulances...

14:10.560 --> 14:12.760
I remember
the helicopter flying off.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.880
He cut his left wrist
and his throat.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.280
I was 16. Pippa was six years old.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.920
We've all got
such different memories.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.440
What can we know,
that day how Dad killed himself?

14:59.520 --> 15:03.200
Of course our brains are going to
make funny stories and make things up.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.080
How can someone
just stop being there?

15:07.160 --> 15:10.480
How can my dad just not be?

15:15.880 --> 15:18.640
It was almost like
we weren't worth living for.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.000
If your own dad
doesn't want to stick around...

15:26.080 --> 15:28.520
then you can't be that great of a person.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.200
I couldn't imagine any days
coming after that day.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.200
I felt like we were just gonna be
frozen in time there.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.480
Forever.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.800
For years after he died,
I always thought it was probably a joke.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.000
That he's not actually gone,
he was just pretending.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.880
And that he'll still come back one day.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.400
Like, sometimes I swear I see him
in the street,

16:02.480 --> 16:04.520
and I think, "God, is that Dad?"

16:06.600 --> 16:09.640
I don't wish for him to come back now,
'cause I know it's not gonna happen.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.120
But I used to wish all the time that...

16:14.320 --> 16:16.480
he'd come back, or like...

16:16.560 --> 16:19.280
Actually I do still wish.
I do.

16:19.360 --> 16:24.880
I sometimes pray at night that he'll
come in my dreams or something.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.120
Or that he'll...

16:26.960 --> 16:31.200
Just 'cause there's so many things
I want to ask him. And, like...

16:32.200 --> 16:35.440
that I just want to hug him again
and hold his hand.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.800
But I can't.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.680
If he was here now,
what would you ask him?

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
Um...

16:49.240 --> 16:52.000
I'd ask him to sing my song.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
That he wrote.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.560
Nikita?

17:05.160 --> 17:08.358
Are you helping Mummy
make the evening meal?

17:10.598 --> 17:14.598
I didn't always understand
what was going on when I was younger.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.598
I think it's part of my autism.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.960
So when people would talk to me,

17:20.040 --> 17:23.598
I'd have to act like I knew
what I was saying...

17:24.720 --> 17:26.760
and in my head, I was screaming.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.600
It all just sounded like a big slur.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.000
Give me a really big smile, Lorie.
I want to show Mummy and Daddy this.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.800
Oh, Lorie, please give me smile.
I want to show Mummy and Daddy.

17:51.160 --> 17:56.640
I know how to portray anger,
sadness, depressed, laughter, ecstatic...

17:57.680 --> 17:59.360
But I don't know how to read them.

18:01.120 --> 18:05.120
Nikita and Lorie, Pippa and
Osborn have been diagnosed with it.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.040
- Um, my youngest sister.
- I'm six years old.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.920
My birthday is...

18:12.880 --> 18:14.720
It's like trying to
thread an eye of a needle,

18:15.320 --> 18:19.520
but with really blurry glasses on.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.600
You want to do something so bad,
but you just can't do it

18:23.680 --> 18:26.160
'cause there's something holding you back.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.720
Right, Mirie. Give me a smile.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.720
People look at me and say,
"Um, you don't act autistic."

18:36.880 --> 18:43.520
Well, a lot of the time
I'm trying to just be normal.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.400
- What was that band called?
- Ozzy, stop!

18:46.480 --> 18:50.960
♪ Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye ♪

18:51.560 --> 18:54.000
Why don't you just let it
come naturally when you sing?

18:54.640 --> 18:56.480
- Ozzy...
- Stop it!

18:58.440 --> 19:00.520
Ozzy, are you doing this thing or not? No!

19:00.600 --> 19:03.000
You wanted to be in it? No!
Are you going to be a performer? No!

19:03.080 --> 19:05.280
Are you a scientist? Maybe! Shut up!

19:05.360 --> 19:07.960
- Osborn? Ozzy? Ozzy?
- You know I'm right.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.000
Listen, you do not spend
three and a half minutes on stage

19:11.080 --> 19:12.840
just doing this...

19:12.920 --> 19:16.080
No, you don't have to do that.
You can move around, walk around.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.720
Okay, let's bump into each other, then.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.480
- But that doesn't look natural.
- Osborn!

19:19.560 --> 19:21.280
It's just some choreography!

19:21.360 --> 19:24.000
Every performance you watch
is choreographed!

19:24.080 --> 19:26.640
I had just taken a phone call from work!

19:28.600 --> 19:30.440
Breathe in...

19:31.800 --> 19:33.000
Don't breathe on me.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.240
- Pippa, please.
- Sorry.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.200
Just take some deep breaths
and calm down a bit.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.360
I'm cleaning my room...

19:47.560 --> 19:51.440
because, um, my mum thinks that I have to.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.000
But I think otherwise.

19:54.680 --> 19:59.680
I think that it doesn't actually matter

19:59.760 --> 20:04.560
because one day I'm going to die.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.040
And when I die, it won't matter.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.320
So it shouldn't really matter now.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.480
Recently, I've been thinking about

20:12.560 --> 20:14.880
what actually matters
and what's important.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.040
And I think the only important thing
is being happy.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.680
Nik, how often a week would you say
you paint your nails for?

20:20.760 --> 20:22.720
People don't like thinking about death.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.720
And that's probably why people end up
doing things they don't want to do,

20:25.800 --> 20:28.640
because they think
that they'll live forever.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.840
And they sort of push death aside
'cause it's taboo.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.880
But it's got to be spoken about.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.440
I'm holding this right now,
but I'm gonna put it down in a second.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.480
And then the time when I was holding it
will be in the past.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.280
And that was only a couple of seconds ago.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.040
But it's not...
it's not happening anymore.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.720
And now, it was here and now it's there.

20:57.600 --> 21:02.520
But it was in my hand
and it felt like the present...

21:03.200 --> 21:07.080
but it didn't because I knew
that soon it would be down there.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.360
And now I've picked it up again.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.520
And when it was down there,
it feels like the past, straight away.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.960
And I think that's quite unusual,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.640
because you never really feel
time moving on

21:19.720 --> 21:22.920
until something happens
or until something changes.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.240
I feel like
we're always living in the past

21:31.320 --> 21:36.440
because the last time we'll ever feel
in the present is just as we're dying.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.200
And although right now
I still have my future...

21:41.640 --> 21:45.000
when it's over,
everything will be the past.

21:46.400 --> 21:50.240
I feel like that's our life.
Our life will always be in the past.

21:55.520 --> 21:59.360
Even if something bad happens on a day,
I manage to stay happy.

22:04.440 --> 22:09.320
Because once it's happened,
it's gone and it's in the past.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.920
Yes, I know. I'm just stressed
because I can't stand the house anymore.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.960
- Let's all do it.
- Yeah!

22:26.040 --> 22:28.320
Don't stand there moaning at me,
just do it.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.200
And you've been moaning in there
about that moldy cake.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.440
Fruit decomposes,
cake does not decompose.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.480
It goes moldy.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.920
Ozzy,
it won't decompose on the tarmac.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.320
It will decompose anywhere, actually.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.640
- Have you seen the lobby?
- Yes.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.560
Oh, my God. Whose shoe?
Does anyone wear this?

22:47.640 --> 22:50.160
How would I know
who one shoe belongs to?

22:50.240 --> 22:52.800
Would you want to go back to living
with bare walls and no more Internet?

22:52.880 --> 22:56.160
- No, but we've gone to the other extreme.
- Yes, we have.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.840
We went from having nothing
to having too much.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.320
And now we can barely breathe.

23:02.760 --> 23:05.680
Like, do we need
that many boxes of cereal?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.200
How many of those
do you reckon are stale?

23:08.280 --> 23:09.360
And can't be eaten anyway.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.120
None of them are, actually.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.680
I just want you to start listening to me
and doing something.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.120
And I'll help you. I've said that.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.040
Will you start listening to me?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.680
I've tried listening to you, Mum.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.320
Kacie, will you start listening to me

23:24.400 --> 23:27.600
when I say I need you to pay for your car,
I need you to pay rent?

23:27.680 --> 23:28.520
Yes.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.280
- Will you?
- Yes.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.880
Because you don't.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.840
You're quick to attack me.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.520
I'm not attacking you.
I want to help you.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.920
It's not doing any of you
any good living like this.

24:00.560 --> 24:04.240
It feels like a parallel universe,
before he died.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.440
This sounds pathetic,
but we didn't have furniture.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.840
And the walls were all the same color.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.240
He didn't like clutter

24:17.320 --> 24:18.640
and he didn't like
things being in the house.

24:18.720 --> 24:22.160
So he boxed everything up
and put them in containers.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.800
It was all kind of sentimental.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.400
The containers have gone.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.520
Big empty space.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.760
Oh, my God. Looks about...

24:35.120 --> 24:37.120
Looks really weird, you know.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.600
Feels weird.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.040
Dad, can you tell us how you feel?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.240
Dad, tell us how you feel.

24:44.320 --> 24:48.360
I feel you have to accept things
like this... Um...

24:50.360 --> 24:55.000
And it's time to move to a different
chapter and get the barns organized.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.680
Very, very well said.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.400
There's the barns.

25:02.680 --> 25:06.200
When he died,
all the boxes got dropped off here again.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.560
I am now gonna ask
three of my sisters

25:22.640 --> 25:24.480
to perform a show.

25:24.560 --> 25:28.240
They are each gonna do something
different, but it is gonna be funny.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.400
Please welcome, Mirie Shanks.

25:32.800 --> 25:37.000
She's going to do
her famous dancing.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.520
I have an idea that we can maybe

25:55.600 --> 25:58.920
promote everything that you do
on my YouTube channel.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.760
In that case, you can make
a piece of clothing and I can wear it.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.920
I said to Nikita and Pippa,
maybe all three of us could find a tune...

26:06.000 --> 26:07.960
There's a song that
all three of us have written.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.680
And I'm really bad at writing, so...

26:11.680 --> 26:15.000
'Cause I'd be just be thinking
of the song. I wouldn't be writing.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.720
Your father used to write, um...

26:17.800 --> 26:19.440
He used to play the guitar...

26:20.240 --> 26:24.880
and find something
he liked the sound of, musically.

26:24.960 --> 26:29.120
And then write words to it
and then do a bit more.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.040
So he would sort of piece them together
as he went along.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.360
I'm not very good at writing.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.720
I just always say the same thing.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.200
So that's why I asked Nikita
and Pippa to help me.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.000
There's power in being together.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.800
This is why I keep telling you
to develop an act as a group.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.320
I'd rather be by myself.

26:45.400 --> 26:51.400
Be on my own and then do, maybe,
a few great pieces to put on it.

26:52.200 --> 26:57.040
Okay. I just think you've all got more...
a greater chance of success together.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.920
So you don't think we could all make it
on our own?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.680
No, I think you can all make it
on your own.

27:04.760 --> 27:08.880
I think it would be 100 times easier
if you made it as a group first.

You know how Dad used to always play
a song every morning at six o'clock?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.320
Please, no one say,
"You shouldn't feel like that, Pippa."

27:33.400 --> 27:35.240
But I feel stupid now
because I didn't know that.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.640
No, no, no, no, no. It's okay.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.840

Okay, Pippa looks like
she's about to cry so I'm just gonna...

28:10.280 --> 28:13.880
- No, I'm okay.
- No, I love this song. I love it.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.360
Pippa, think about the positives.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.960
Jamie, I can't. It's not just...

28:19.320 --> 28:22.400
My Internet's gone.
But I've got it on my phone.

28:22.480 --> 28:27.360
It's like, it's certain music and films,
Jamie, bring back bad memories.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.760
And, you know, that's okay.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.640
Okay, ready?

28:39.720 --> 28:42.200
Losing my dad
completely broke my heart.

28:43.960 --> 28:48.960
He was my best friend and my worst enemy,
all at the same time.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.840
He was funny.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.520
He always used to make my mum laugh.

28:54.600 --> 28:58.760
He was caring, but there were days where

28:58.840 --> 29:01.480
the sun could be shining
and there wouldn't be a cloud in the sky,

29:01.560 --> 29:07.680
but it just felt like the gloomiest,
saddest, most tense-filled day.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.720
Dad, smile.

29:22.560 --> 29:27.040
He... he was a scary person.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.200
There's Daddy.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.840
But he was nice as well.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.200
I don't know. He was weird.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.320
He was hard to understand.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.760
When he was in a bad mood,
he just wouldn't talk,

29:37.840 --> 29:39.320
and he'd go write in his diary.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.040
I mean, I haven't read it in much detail.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.960
I haven't even read his suicide note,
but I'd like to.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.040
It was always getting in the car
after school,

29:49.120 --> 29:51.480
and being like, "Mum,
is Dad in a good mood or a bad mood?"

29:51.560 --> 29:52.960
'Cause that meant when we got home...

29:53.640 --> 29:57.480
that he'd sit us all down
and give us a rant for about four hours.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.520
I'd end up falling asleep on the floor

29:59.600 --> 30:01.400
and then going to bed
at 1:00 in the morning.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.160
Please give me that. Sorry, Lorie.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.640
I'm trying to talk on camera to you all
so that...

30:06.720 --> 30:11.360
I wanted what I wanted to say
to you to be on camera, on tape,

30:11.440 --> 30:16.320
so you'll know in the future how I was
thinking and feeling about everything.

30:17.480 --> 30:21.120
You've got to work out
how to run your life...

30:23.280 --> 30:25.960
so that I can do what I've got to do.

30:26.040 --> 30:30.240
Jamie is at the most impressionable age

30:30.320 --> 30:34.520
that she's been at
since she has been alive.

30:34.600 --> 30:39.640
I'd like two people
to be the most influential,

30:39.720 --> 30:41.840
and I want it to be me and Mummy.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.600
I don't want it to be other people
who I don't know,

30:45.680 --> 30:46.840
and I don't know what they're saying

30:46.920 --> 30:48.800
and I don't know
how they're making Jamie think.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.720
My dad use to have a tendency
to, um, keep me up late.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.440
And then obviously,

30:56.520 --> 30:59.520
when it reached a point
that I used to stay up late

30:59.600 --> 31:01.720
in order to be able to hear him.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.720
Sort of hear whether or not
he was in the house,

31:04.800 --> 31:08.440
whether he was back
or whether he was gonna come upstairs...

31:09.240 --> 31:13.160
and have a go at me
for some unknown, bizarre reason.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.280
There was a lot of occasions
that I would be...

31:17.760 --> 31:22.040
forced to look in the mirror
that used to hang 'round the corner.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.320
And he would hold my face.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.000
And he'd tell me
that I looked like a crack whore.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.360
I genuinely hate the sight of myself
when I have no makeup on.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.360
Euro money?

31:51.120 --> 31:53.680
"I would like to take you to France
at the end of July.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.000
Happy birthday. Love, Dad.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.360
I have booked us a week's holiday
in France."

32:01.640 --> 32:04.840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.880
Dad!

32:05.960 --> 32:08.160
I'm going to France. I'm going to France.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.960
- Dad...
- I'm going to France!

32:11.040 --> 32:13.960
If I'm honest, I was absolutely petrified.

32:25.400 --> 32:31.440
We were driving this one night in
the middle of the countryside in France,

32:31.520 --> 32:33.720
and I mean the middle of nowhere.

32:39.080 --> 32:44.240
All of a sudden, my dad stopped the car
down this pitch black country lane.

32:46.920 --> 32:52.520
Suddenly, in that moment, I was like,
"Oh, my God. What is about to happen?"

32:54.120 --> 32:56.320
And he said, "Get out of the car."

33:04.120 --> 33:08.360
And he walked me
about 20 yards down the road.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.400
And just all of a sudden...

33:13.840 --> 33:15.320
he just said, "Look up."

33:25.960 --> 33:28.400
I've never seen so many stars
in all my life.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.760
It was like somebody had just
thrown glitter across the sky.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.640
My dad got us to lay down
on the middle of this road...

33:38.520 --> 33:41.480
and we lay there
and just looked up at all these stars.

33:43.480 --> 33:50.160
Just that 10 to 15 minutes that I got
where we were like a father and daughter.

34:12.239 --> 34:16.480
Because of the way Dad was,
we weren't very exposed.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.719
I think he wanted us all to be perfect
and he thought

34:20.800 --> 34:25.159
if weren't, you know, "out in the wild,"
if you like,

34:25.239 --> 34:27.280
then we could become that way.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.600
Nikita, are you gonna get in?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.600
We were all going to grow up anyway.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.320
So he couldn't have kept us
that way forever.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.600
I think he realized that.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.920
You know,
these are old cassette tapes,

35:01.000 --> 35:02.080
but I don't know what's on them all,

35:02.160 --> 35:04.120
so are you sure
you all want to watch this?

35:04.200 --> 35:05.520
- Yeah.
- You sure?

35:05.600 --> 35:06.640
Yeah.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.680
Even though
it's possibly gonna be upsetting?

35:08.760 --> 35:09.920
- Yeah?
- Yes.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.160
Is it gonna be really blurry?

35:11.240 --> 35:13.000
I don't know
'cause they're old and...

35:13.080 --> 35:15.360
They're very old cassettes,
so I don't know.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.320
That one there. That's Dad.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.560
- Yeah, that's Dad, yeah.
- That's him with the children?

35:37.240 --> 35:39.280
Oh, that's me, fat.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.520
Okay, Jamie,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.440
Daddy would like to talk to you
for a minute.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.480
Now, it's a year since I interviewed you.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.880
Because it's my birthday tomorrow.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.720
- That's it.
- And I'll be five.

35:52.800 --> 35:57.560
Yeah, it's a whole year since
we had this little chat, didn't we?

35:57.640 --> 35:58.720
- On video.
- Yeah.

35:59.360 --> 36:02.720
- Would you say you're a happy girl?
- Yes, I am happy.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.600
- Do you like your life?
- Yes.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.800
Well, I've written this one
just for you, for your birthday.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.760
Yeah.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.520
Would you like me to sing it to you now?
Would you?

36:11.600 --> 36:12.680
Yes.

36:12.760 --> 36:13.960
Okay.

I don't know. It's...
I don't know his real...

37:16.680 --> 37:19.680
Like, I imagined it, like, deeper.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.880
I didn't know he had an accent.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.240
- It's really weird.
- Yeah.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.160
I didn't know he had an accent.

37:27.240 --> 37:31.600
It's hard to remember voices.
It's so hard to remember voices.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.320
He laughed a lot.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.200
Oh.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.520
I'm going to go
and take the camera off Mummy

37:43.600 --> 37:48.280
and then we're going to say goodbye
to the camera until next year.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.520
Okay. Chop-chop.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.480
No, it's a wee thing.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.360
What are you thinking, Osborn?

38:09.080 --> 38:10.600
The shed is full of shit.

38:13.880 --> 38:18.640
Too much stuff in here
for one family to deal with.

38:22.920 --> 38:26.880
Things that shouldn't have
the sentimental value do, and it's...

38:26.960 --> 38:30.480
It makes throwing things away
a big hoo-ha.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.560
The past Shanks family made a very big
problem for the future Shanks family.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.800
It's like we didn't care about us.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.880
That's a metaphor
for our mentality tonight.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.280
Just pushing all of our crap aside
for a few days.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.920
Mum, we need a pile in that corner
of electrical appliances.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.160
Do you really want to keep it?

38:51.240 --> 38:52.640
- Mum, Mum.
- Yeah, Mirie and I were talking...

38:52.720 --> 38:56.080
Do you not remember we got the black one.
That one wasn't working.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.800
- Have we?
- Yeah, we got the black one.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.400
- What's this?
- Textiles.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.800
Look at Lorie.

39:01.880 --> 39:05.360
- Oh, what is that?
- Are you gonna put those inside?

39:08.880 --> 39:10.040
I found Dad!

39:10.120 --> 39:12.440
That's where he's been
for the past years.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.240
- You silly man.
- He's covered in poop.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.960
Wait, who did we bury then?

39:17.440 --> 39:20.520
Ah! Holy crap!

39:21.120 --> 39:23.880
- What?
- This is the box I'm thinking of.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.080
But these are all cassettes.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.160
But there aren't any videos in there.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.200
Yeah, but they're Dad's songs,
aren't they?

39:33.840 --> 39:35.760
I hope there's "A Perfect World" on here.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.720
- Oh, there will be.
- Really?

39:38.800 --> 39:40.000
Yeah, I'm sure there will be.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.320
Okay, I'm gonna spend hours
looking through these.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.040
Oh, no,
that's from his cabaret days.

39:48.360 --> 39:51.680
- No, I don't. Not sure.
- That's so cool.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.120
My dad loved music.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.120
He did Butlins and the West End,
and he did all sorts.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.520
- You remember Elvis? Elvis Presley.
- Yeah!

40:08.720 --> 40:10.560
He used to play to me all time.

40:10.640 --> 40:15.240
So, I think that's a big influence
as to why I want to carry on music.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.480
My dad could have made it and didn't.

40:21.560 --> 40:25.440
And I don't want to make
that same mistake.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.560
Ready? And then go again.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.480
I thought I had it. I don't.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.840
♪ Is it a little bit funny? ♪

40:39.400 --> 40:40.960
Close.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.800
Look, my hands aren't big enough to do it.

40:43.880 --> 40:46.160
And mine are just about...
Mine are a bit longer.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.560
I'll have to change it.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.040
♪ How long will I love you? ♪

40:52.640 --> 40:56.880
♪ As long as the stars are above you ♪

40:57.560 --> 41:00.280
My dream would be to be on stage.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.240
To not be able see anything
but lights in my face.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.920
And then I'd hear a massive roar
and clapping

41:12.000 --> 41:16.840
and cheering and flashing lights
of the cameras and then...

41:20.840 --> 41:22.800
And then I'd think it'd be over
just like that,

41:22.880 --> 41:24.480
'cause you're just enjoying it so much.

41:27.600 --> 41:32.520
But you don't want to dream too high
because then it might not come true.

41:34.800 --> 41:38.480
When we were younger,
our dad would always say

41:38.560 --> 41:41.920
we'd be going to somewhere,
or that we'd do this next year

41:42.000 --> 41:47.120
or this would be happening
and then nothing would ever happen.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.400
I think we've all just...

41:50.000 --> 41:54.200
tried not to keep our hopes up
so we don't get disappointed ever again.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.960
Oh.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.760
Sunday, 22nd of September.

42:18.840 --> 42:23.000
Friday the 27th. 2nd of October, 11:15...

42:23.080 --> 42:27.920
Christmas Day, 2002, and that's how
Santa left the presents last night...

42:31.400 --> 42:35.560
I thought everyone's dad wrote
in such detail in diaries.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.720
I didn't think it was anything unusual.

42:39.480 --> 42:43.400
It's recently that I've actually started
analyzing them in detail.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.080
He says, "Go back to the real Paul,"
which is really weird.

42:47.160 --> 42:50.000
Sort of felt like he was changing.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.760
He put a lot of effort into these things

42:53.840 --> 42:56.760
and then all of a sudden
he just stops trying.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.200
He just gives up on it.

43:00.840 --> 43:04.120
So, you can see that
he sort of gave up on life,

43:04.200 --> 43:06.880
'cause he gave up on writing about it.

43:08.360 --> 43:11.400
I just found Daddy's 2005 diary...

43:12.160 --> 43:15.160
which I thought you might be
interested in looking at.

43:15.240 --> 43:16.320
Yeah.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.200
But also the suicide note.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.880
I went into the cabin this morning
and had a really good look and I found it.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.520
- Can I see it?
- You want to read it?

43:26.600 --> 43:27.760
Yeah.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.920
- Want me to stay while you read it?
- I don't mind.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.720
It's not gonna be, like,
difficult or anything.

43:42.680 --> 43:46.520
"There are two sets of truths."
Is that what that says?

43:48.960 --> 43:50.920
- Yeah.
- "Involved"?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.920
- Involved.
- "...involved in my opinion.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.160
The truth and Vikie's truth."

43:58.800 --> 44:00.360
He used the wrong "there."

44:01.480 --> 44:02.440
Hmm.

44:03.080 --> 44:08.160
Did he usually do that?
Or was that sort of the crazy setting in?

44:08.240 --> 44:09.520
I don't know.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.240
- Could you see it?
- Yeah.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.240
In the last couple of weeks
I could see it, yeah.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.760
What sort of changed about him?

44:17.520 --> 44:19.720
- The paranoia became...
- Did he become more scatty?

44:19.800 --> 44:22.160
He became less certain
of what he was saying

44:22.240 --> 44:24.680
and he made mistakes in his diaries, too.

44:27.200 --> 44:32.320
I don't see how he changed so quickly.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.520
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

44:35.600 --> 44:39.320
Sure? "To my children, I love you all.

44:39.400 --> 44:43.640
Good luck with life and love from..."

44:46.600 --> 44:51.000
"Good luck with Mum on a long-term basis."

44:51.080 --> 44:53.880
"On a long-term basis."
What does PTO mean?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.840
There's something on the other side,
but it was nothing in the police...

44:57.840 --> 45:01.520
- I think this is the police photocopy.
- I want to know what it says.

45:01.600 --> 45:05.400
I don't want to live my life
not knowing what the PTO was.

45:14.360 --> 45:18.600
"I have not wanted the children
to go to private school since 2001.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.920
Had they gone to state school
at that point,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.680
we would not be
in any financial difficulty."

45:24.640 --> 45:27.160
Was it you or Dad that insisted on us
going to private school?

45:30.320 --> 45:33.880
It used to rock
between the two of us.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.560
- Five re-mortgages?
- Yeah.

45:44.640 --> 45:45.800
- Five.
- Yeah.

45:45.880 --> 45:47.360
Why?

45:49.400 --> 45:54.320
Well, he spent £10,000 on the barn,
£10,000 on the hard court down there.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.440
"Vikie has been well aware
of the borrowing that has taken place."

46:03.440 --> 46:04.680
Not all of it.

46:05.680 --> 46:09.640
I think it's quite sad that he had
good intentions with all of this,

46:09.720 --> 46:11.880
but it seemed to backfire, considerably.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.440
Wow. That was interesting.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.200
- I feel disillusioned.
- Why?

46:32.280 --> 46:33.760
I don’t know.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.880
- Why disillusioned?
- I don't know.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.320
Did you imagine it to have more
about us in, Kay?

46:41.400 --> 46:43.720
- With what?
- I don't know.

46:43.800 --> 46:47.200
- There were two sides to it?
- Yeah, of course there were.

46:48.680 --> 46:52.440
- I'm not perfect, Kacie. I'm not a saint.
- I didn't say that you did.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.120
Yeah, there are two sides to every story.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.240
- I know.
- Yeah.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.280
Can you get the original note back?

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
I'm gonna try, if they've still got it.

47:08.960 --> 47:13.680
We are going to write
"Mum's worries."

47:14.680 --> 47:15.960
Okay?

47:16.040 --> 47:19.280
Mum's worries is going in the box.
There we go.

47:24.200 --> 47:27.160
Kacie, go over with Jamie
and wave at the worries together.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.960
Bye-bye. Hey.

47:31.040 --> 47:34.120
Paul's behavior was becoming
ever more erratic

47:34.200 --> 47:38.800
and I was insisting that we have
a six-month break from each other.

47:38.880 --> 47:41.080
And then see if we had a future together.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.760
- Bye.
- Bye.

47:42.840 --> 47:45.400
But Paul decided to file for divorce.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.760
The house was sold when Paul died.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.400
I think we were about four weeks away
from completion when Paul killed himself.

48:11.320 --> 48:15.160
I remember months after he died,
I'd still run downstairs shouting, "Dad,"

48:15.240 --> 48:18.560
like, trying to call for him
and then I'd realize he wasn't there.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.640
- Do you remember us doing that?
- Yeah.

48:20.720 --> 48:24.120
What if he had followed through
with the plan that he had?

48:24.200 --> 48:26.200
Well, then we wouldn't be here,
would we, Oz?

48:26.280 --> 48:28.960
Was it planned for him to do that
and then kill himself?

48:29.040 --> 48:30.280
Yeah.

48:31.080 --> 48:34.320
No, I don't think we really knew
to what extent, like,

48:34.400 --> 48:36.920
Dad was actually in a very dark place.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.880
Two days after my dad had died,
three of us found the notepad,

48:45.960 --> 48:49.680
you know, with him talking about
how he was going to...

48:52.400 --> 48:57.600
get revenge on my mum, effectively,
and kill all of us...

48:58.440 --> 49:00.560
then kill her and then kill himself.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.120
It was very detailed.

49:05.280 --> 49:09.800
His plan was to lock everybody
in their bedrooms...

49:11.520 --> 49:14.080
and then bring them down one by one.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.840
Back to my mum.

49:19.560 --> 49:21.400
- All right, darling?
- Yeah.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.920
Two or three years before he died,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.760
he suddenly put bolts
on the outside of all the doors.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.120
He said it was to keep the cats out.

49:32.200 --> 49:35.480
But just shutting the doors
would have kept the cats out.

49:38.200 --> 49:41.120
Things that were odd
became normal in our lives.

49:51.200 --> 49:56.360
It was about 18 months after Paul's death
that I said to Jamie one day...

49:57.600 --> 50:00.760
"I feel as though I've made this up.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.440
Did we find a pad?"

50:04.560 --> 50:10.000
After a while you question things.
You're not sure they're actually real.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.800
I thought it didn't exist.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.160
I thought it had just been me
in a state of shock.

50:18.240 --> 50:20.200
And then Kacie
shot out of her bedroom,

50:20.280 --> 50:22.080
'cause she'd heard the conversation,
and said,

50:22.160 --> 50:24.960
"Oh, my God,
I thought I'd made it up as well."

50:25.800 --> 50:28.480
I broke down in tears,
I had panic attacks.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.800
I had very increased anxiety
after that happened.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.880
She'd just confirmed that actually

50:34.960 --> 50:38.400
what I had believed to be a dream was,
in fact, not a dream.

50:38.480 --> 50:40.560
Because I had seen it as well.

50:55.080 --> 50:56.720
Where'd you find this?

50:57.520 --> 50:59.640
They're all the tapes,
the home videos.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.560
Did you put it in the wrong way?
Is it meant to be that way?

51:16.000 --> 51:17.320

Isn't it weird?

52:59.120 --> 53:00.280
Yeah.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.160
I can’t believe that Dad and you planted
this tree when I was born.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.560
It only stood about 12 feet tall,
didn't it?

53:18.640 --> 53:20.440
No, less than that. Six?

53:21.080 --> 53:23.600
- When did you plant it?
- Twenty-four years ago.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.560
No, you were about three.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.320
About three?

53:28.200 --> 53:32.200
It's a red oak.
Oak is known for its strength, isn't it?

53:33.600 --> 53:35.680
- Time goes too fast.
- He planted it because it was strong.

53:35.760 --> 53:37.960
- He planted it 'cause it was strong.
- Yeah.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.040
It'll live for hundreds of years.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.560
I didn't know that.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.760
My dad did love all of us.

53:58.560 --> 54:02.720
I think I lost touch with that
for a little while after he passed away.

54:05.680 --> 54:10.640
I can still remember, the Thursday morning
before my dad died...

54:11.280 --> 54:13.760
him having come into my room
and he closed the door.

54:15.240 --> 54:18.600
I remember how his hair was falling
around his face...

54:19.680 --> 54:21.920
and he just pleaded with me.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.880
He told me that he had nobody left
and that I was his last hope.

54:29.440 --> 54:33.680
My response to him was, I looked down...

54:34.800 --> 54:37.120
"Dad, I've gotta get ready for school."

54:38.920 --> 54:42.600
And in that moment, it was like he died.

54:45.440 --> 54:50.240
The man who took himself into the woods
that day wasn't my dad.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.080
He was a man that none of us knew.

54:55.720 --> 54:59.200
I really wish that I'd just been
a little bit older to understand.

- Be careful with it. It's very fragile.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.120
Beautiful.

57:39.760 --> 57:42.040
For me,
it has to always be the same.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.800
You do it so neatly, too.

57:43.880 --> 57:45.240
It's a tradition.

57:46.520 --> 57:48.600
We have to stick to the same thing.

57:49.400 --> 57:52.760
I don't like that we're all changing
and getting older.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.200
It makes me feel sad.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.600
Wait, guys. Just stop.

58:02.360 --> 58:06.280
It just feels like yesterday
that we were all still in school.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.440
We were all at the same level.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.160
And I don't like
that it's different

58:30.240 --> 58:33.760
'cause it means we're getting old
and gonna die soon. And I don't wanna die.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.560
Lorie!

58:41.640 --> 58:45.200
Kacie, this is gonna be
the day before my seventh birthday.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.720
Are you very happy?

58:46.800 --> 58:47.880
Yeah.

58:48.640 --> 58:52.000
Are you very happy
it's nearly my birthday?

58:52.800 --> 58:54.440
Yeah!

58:55.120 --> 58:56.800
That's really weird,
I remember that happening.

59:00.240 --> 59:02.160
This is where I tip over the edge.

59:02.800 --> 59:06.640
Jamie's about to open her MP3 player
and I'm opening my CD player.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.680
- Oh, that's great!
- I remember when you did that.

59:10.760 --> 59:13.880

Do you think maybe he did it
because we were all tone deaf

59:26.040 --> 59:28.400
and he realized
we wouldn't be able to follow his path?

59:35.120 --> 59:37.880
Mum, why didn't we ever realize
that he was sad?

59:38.600 --> 59:40.960
- I did.
- Yeah, but we didn't.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.800
Because we were kids, Nik.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.920
We didn't have any perception
of what other people...

59:46.000 --> 59:47.760
Yeah, but, like, when we were younger,
we couldn't see that.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.400
Daddy, look.

59:50.200 --> 59:53.440
- Was he upset on his last birthday? Mum?
- I know, I just feel sorry for him.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.320
'Cause every video we've watched,
he's been sad

59:55.400 --> 59:57.280
- and we're just running around laughing.
- I know.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.120
And we don't realize.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.040
He's not been upset
in every video. Some videos he's happy.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.520
- Poppet, you wouldn't be expected to know.
- But I was nine.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.760
- How would you know?
- How are you to know at nine?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.160
I barely knew and I was 13.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.360
Now when I'm watching it,
I just wanna go and hug him.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.520
You've got to remember that

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.760
there's no way
we could have made him happy.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.000
He was going to be upset
no matter what we did.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.600
Yeah, but at least
he would have known that we cared.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.480
Yeah, well, we did care.
We just didn't know.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.760
What, Daddy?

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.360

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.400

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.760

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.800

cared what people thought

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.440
about how happy he was all the time.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.280
How he was feeling inside,
he masked extremely well.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.880
But only to people outside the family.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.320
He didn't want to believe that
there was anything wrong with him.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.120
Even though I think he knew.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.880
How... how can you not?

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.720

- Mum, I really can't.
- Pip, so when are you going to eat?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.800
Pippa, come on, poppet.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.560
Mum, stop saying things
over and over. Mum, it doesn't help.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.040
Go and get your bag
'cause the bus will be here any second.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.200
I said I would give you two days,
and then you promised you would eat.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.160
Pippi, it's five days.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.440
Pippa?

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.680
Mum,
I'm not doing it for attention.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.840
It's not just as simple as
just eat breakfast,

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.160
just a few mouthfuls.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.880
- Come on.
- Okay, see you later, guys.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.480
- Come on, sweetheart. Come on.
- Bye, Oz.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.720
Mum, I don't want to go...

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.640
It's okay. Come on, I love you.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.160
Will you please
not ring the doctor's?

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.040
Okay, I won't ring the doctor.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.800
I love you, sweetheart. Bye.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.680
This is not about
an eating disorder.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.600
There's something much more problematic
and deep-rooted with Pippa.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.600
It's taken seven years since Paul died
to not be able to understand it.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.040
And the doctors don't understand it.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.920
And I can't work it out.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.960
Is it something
that someone else can uncover?

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.400
Or does it need for Pippa to get
to the point where she can...

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.800
do her own self-discovery...

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.360
and find out for herself
what the real issue is?

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.560
When I was nine,
I said to my mum...

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.880
"Mum, I don't feel well.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.520
I just don't feel myself."

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.880
I miss being me.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.200
Like, I just know that this isn't me.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.160
I don't know.
It's really hard to describe.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.480
- Fucking hell.
- What?

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.480
Oh, my goodness, Mum.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.000
- How do you live in here?
- I don't know.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.080
- It makes me want to cry.
- I know.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.560
It's got worse.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.160
You're a hoarder.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.560
Yeah, I don't know if I agree with that.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.520
Mum, look at your bed.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.120
Yeah, well, it's because I knit in bed
and so I keep all my wool handy and...

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.760
- That was a few days ago.
- Just keeping it handy?

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.200
- A Minnie Mouse dog outfit?
- That's for Darcy.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.880
I'm making that for Jo.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.360
A handbag? Just in case you need to
go somewhere in the night, Mum?

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.840
No, I used it to go out
and haven't put it back.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.880
- Do you have one in here?
- No.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.240
- I'll go and get a hairbrush.
- Well, even if you did...

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.120
- I'll go and get my...
- ...there'd be no way of finding it.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.360
I'm not proud of myself and I'm not happy.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.840
- So change it.
- Yeah.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.360
Hey, Oz, look.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.680
"Just a little kindness
is all this sad world needs."

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.640
Oh.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.080
- Kacie?
- Yes?

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.080
Is this what we used for the confetti
for Daddy's funeral?

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.560
Do you want to keep that, Mum?

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.800
Look, there's a little...

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.160
How cute were we, Mum?
Look how lovely that is.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.520
It's a bunny rabbit.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.640
- I don't know what that is. A gnome?
- A little Santa or a gnome?

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.160
It's okay, Mum.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.200
I'll put that somewhere safe.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.160
- It was a nice idea, though, wasn't it?
- It was.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.760
I'm glad I did that.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.960
Sorry.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.760
I'm so sorry.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.200
Why are you sorry, Mum?
Mum, this is all good.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.479
This is a nice thing.
How lovely.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:36.359
I'm gonna take this away now, okay?

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.880
- Sorry.
- It's okay, Mum.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.720
Thank you.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:56.080
I think it's quite suited me, in a way,
not to have to face my own emotions.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:03.359
Now that the kids are growing up, I'm...

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:07.080
I'm starting to have enough brain space

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.080
to start thinking about how I feel.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.439
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.160
Right.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.600
I wanted them to have a proper childhood,
a happy one.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.600
I just wish
I could have protected them more

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.760
from a lot of the things
that they were subjected to.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.360
In RE today, it ended up being,
like, a giant discussion.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.120
What did you talk about today?

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.320
Uh, evidence of the afterlife.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.800
My idea of reincarnation is that we die...

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.000
we finish any unfinished business.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.960
We can stay
and haunt our family for a bit.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.240
And as soon as you're done, you don't go
to heaven 'cause that's a waste of time.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.360
That's just lounging about in a cloud.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.960
You go and you're just...
you're born again.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.160
Here it is.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.200
When my dad passed away...

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.600
my mum found
all of these coping strategies.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.800
There was one
where we wrote a note to our dad.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.200
"To Dad. I have missed you.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.480
We love you and I still don't know
why you killed yourself.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.000
I cry every night
and I'd kill myself just to see you.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.520
I really miss you.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.800
I don't know. Love from Pippa."

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.400
I think my dad,
he had a split personality.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.080
On one side, he loved us,
and he didn't want any harm to come to us.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.240
In fact, he protected us almost too much.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.760
On the other side,
he was trapped in his own mind.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.160
I think that's how he felt.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.040
And he had a plan
that he would kill us all.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.520
And I just think...

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.560
in his right mind, the mind that loved us,

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.840
he thought, "I don't wanna do that
to my family. I love my family."

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.680
So, to protect us, he killed himself.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.720
So that he didn't kill us.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.000
And I don't really care whether
people think that that's true or not,

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.800
or whether that's stupid.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.160
It just, um...

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.640
It puts my mind at ease.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.600
- Hello.
- Last day.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.560
Pip, you know this is gonna be you
in two years' time?

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.560
Yeah.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.040
- Are you gonna miss it?
- No.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.360
Not even, like, a tiny bit?

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.680
Maybe, like, a tiny, tiny bit.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.880
And, like, I'll be going to a job
that I probably want to do

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.680
and I'll be getting paid for it.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.360
You've got to go to college first.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.360
Yeah, but I'll have a job. And at college,
I'll be doing what I want to do.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.480
How do you know you'll have a job?
The economy is not doing very well.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.960
Oh, I can't believe it's your last day.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.480
Give me a hug.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.240
It might be all right for you,
but I'm really struggling.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.440
Mum, it's always gonna be sad
when people leave school.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.560
Mmm.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.680
Shit gets real after school, doesn't it?

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.080
Remember when we used to
pretend that we were super stars?

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah.

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.160
We always had big dreams,

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.800
and now that we're older,
it feels like, "Oh, it's hard."

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.200
You can't just snap your fingers
and everything just happens.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.200
You've gotta proper work for it.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.760
- And, like, doubting yourself.
- Yeah.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.600
- Do you get that?
- Yeah.

Yeah. Are you not gonna get dressed?

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.680
I've always wanted to be
a fashion designer.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.680
I know that's over ambitious.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.120
I always think about having my own show...

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.400
constantly,
especially when I'm going to sleep.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.240
And when I wake up...

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.360
I think of my own show,
and I'm like, "Ah..."

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.200
But then again, someone has to be
the next Vivienne Westwood,

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.800
so why can't I be
the next Vivienne Westwood?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.320
It's worth a try.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.640
"Ed equals swag," apparently.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.760
What is this swag
that they speak of?

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.680
- You got a girlfriend?
- Yeah. Her name's Sarah.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.920
- How did you meet her?
- Through the autism group.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.520
Well, before I met her, I thought
she was gonna be really weird.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.080
And then when I met her,
I was quite surprised.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.600
'Cause she was weird,
but not, like, a weird sort of weird.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.360
She was just different, but it was good.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.080
Have you fallen in love?

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.200
What a weird question.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.680
Yeah, I guess so.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.960
I think love for another person, though,
is the weirdest

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.160
because you have moments
where you want to hug them,

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.120
but then you have moments
when you want to have sex with them,

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.720
and I find that really unusual.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.000
I think it's also hard for me,
because of my autism,

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.560
to know what I'm actually feeling.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.960
Yeah. Exactly.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.120
'Cause I've had a tendency
to mistake emotions for each other.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.200
I can't say to you, "Yes, you're in love."

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.720
I know you're besotted,

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.280
but whether you're in love with Sarah
is another matter.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.720
'Cause the way I see it is,

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.240
I don't think I'd ever find someone
who's better suited for me.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.760
Not at the moment, but you're only 16.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.720
- It's another level.
- Have you ever been in love, then?

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.720
Yeah, I was in love with Daddy.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.680
How long did that last for?

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.000
Well, did you ever, sort of...
fall out of it?

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.880
I suppose our relationship went
from being in love

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.000
to being more of a companion relationship.

I think people don't understand that.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.560
It's been eight years,
but we've only had to...

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.800
like, relive this day eight times
since it happened.

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.080

But the day feels...
The day was always yesterday.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.120
When we went to Minehead Beach...

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.120
the last time
we'd go on holiday with him...

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.920
we made this sandcastle.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.880
I loved the castle at beach today.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.640
And then Dad was like,
"Let's take photos! Let's take photos!"

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.400
Excuse me, everybody.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.240

- We could all get in.

At least two of us stand here...

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.880
...'cause he was different
on holiday.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.040
He was nothing but fun.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.120
Dad, why are you recording?

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.160

happen again and I'm recording...

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.720

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.640
I think it's sad
that he's missed so much.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.080

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.520
I spelt it... Do you know
why I spelt it wrong, Nik?

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.760
- Why?
- 'Cause then I thought

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.880
if it ever went to court,

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.880
- they couldn't use it.
- Are you serious?

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.680
They couldn't do me for it
'cause I'd signed it wrong.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.480
This is brilliant. I love this.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.880

- Since we haven't spoken?
- Mmm.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.520
Two days.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.720

I think seven months is too long
to not give it another try.

And if tonight she came over

Your body is just melting into it.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.440

upcoming events.

You'll have to face all of these things
another day.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.680
And it counteracts and you just think,
"It's not worth it. I can't do it."

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.360
I think that's how my dad felt,
most likely.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:58.200
I do worry that I have...

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.600
I'm similar to my dad.

It's not so much a worry
that he was a bad person,

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.080
it's just, you know,
the monsters inside his head...

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.120
that I'm afraid are going to be
passed down onto me and I'm...

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.960
That's a very scary thought...

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.640
because they're scary monsters.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.160

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.680

- A room full of people having fun?
- Chaos.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.920
Nik, why did people think
you were a bitch?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.640
Yeah, at the beginning of last year,

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.320
people thought I was a bitch
and really stuck up and stuff.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.440
I don't know what people think about me.
I have literally no idea.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.080
- I think it's 'cause I'm posh, as well.
- Trust me.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.520
- Shall I say what everyone thinks?
- No.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.560
They think you're hot
and that you're really cool.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.480
Oh, cool.

- Yeah. He is hot.

any of your friends?

Watching Nikita
in the show last night...

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.880
I suddenly looked at her in a way
I've never looked at her before.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.720
And then looked at all the children.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.920
And all of them are all half me.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.200
And the next thought was,
"Well, they're half Paul."

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.080
I don't know
how I feel about Paul anymore.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:23.000
He left me with a situation,
and I've done the best I can, but...

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.240
I don't know, I almost feel no emotion.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.720
But, kind of, last night, I thought...

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.280
You know, actually,
he couldn't have left me with any...

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.160
any greater gift than the children.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.160
And without him, I wouldn't have them.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.840
And without them, I don't know who I'd be.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.920
We have to think of a word
that could be...

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.000
- That we could use for the future.
- Soon?

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.440
All right.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.480
How about, "One day the open
bleeding wound he left us with

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.160
will soon be a faded scar."

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.120
Or, "One day the bleeding...
the open bleeding wound..."

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.840
- "The open dripping wound..."
- No!

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.520
- "One day the... massacre."
- Guys, you cannot write lyrics.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.040
I think we should throw in the wanting him
to see how far we've come.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.880
Like, that we've achieved the dreams.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.360
We're not there yet.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.600

to achieve in the future.

Oh, my babies. Aw.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.720
- Thank you. Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.760
That's all right.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.760
- She took it out of the flower pot.
- I don't care.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.360
She took it out of the pot.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.800
I'm so sorry.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.400
- I had nothing to do with this.
- Thank you, Osborn.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.640
Is that from you?

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.440
I didn't think she was gonna cry.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.640
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I only put seven pounds in.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.360
Thank you for all being
the most wonderful children on the planet.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.840
Today's lesson
is all about repairing glass doors.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.440
How did you find out
you were autistic? Just quickly.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.320
You told me. I was about four-five.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.640
I just remember,
it's just always been a part of our lives.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.480
People think that
people with autism lack in empathy.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:20.440
But I think it's, sometimes,
actually the complete opposite.

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.080
And that they have so much empathy
that they don't know how to deal with it.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:34.200
♪ Do you want us to cry? ♪

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.040
Oh, hello. I just spoke to someone
regarding some evidence.

01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.800
It was my husband's suicide note
that was held by the police,

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.240
that I've never had access
to the original.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.200
'Cause there's a PTO on one of the pages

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.320
that we've never actually been
able to see.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:08.920
Okay.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.760
It's annoying, isn't it?

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.480
You try and do something,
and you just come against a brick wall.

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.760
I think that whenever you move,

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.040
it's obviously, like...
I've not experienced it before.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.480
But you gotta be, like,

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.400
"Right, what do I want to take with me

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.840
and what do I not really mind
so much letting go of."

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.040
"Three months and two weeks ago,

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:45.120
my dad committed suicide,
and it's left my whole family heartbroken.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.880
The day before he died, I said,
'Life couldn't get any worse.'

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.200
How wrong I was.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.800
Sometimes I wonder why life is so complex.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.800
We all ask questions and we come
no closer to the answers we want,

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.320
and, more importantly, need."

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.600
Jamie, what were you saying to me

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:13.280
about you felt as though
last year went quickly?

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.760
What I was saying is that...

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:23.640
it feels like that you've only been
how old you are for five days.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.760
That's what I meant.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.160
Now you've, you know...
You feel like you haven't been...

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.280
...seven for a year.
You've been seven for five days.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.360
Yes, I know what you mean.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.520
It's not like I'm saying goodbye forever,
but...

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.680
it's just, like,
it's officially happening.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.080
Moving on to the next phase.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.160
In ten years' time, when you look back
on this part of your life...

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.440
what do you think you'll say to yourself?

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.960
I don't know.
I can't see that far into the future.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:17.400
I don't really see anything above 16.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.000
Okay.

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.480
I feel like
my life's stopped being written.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.480
Will you feel better
once you know what's happening?

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.480
I'm just numb.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.200
Even when I feel happy, I don't...
I can't feel it.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.960
I just feel numb,
and my head just feels numb.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.080
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Miz.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.520
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Nice makeup, by the way.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.720
- Okay. Love you, darling. Bye.
- Drive safely, Mirie.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.240
- Bye, Mum. I love you both.
- I love you.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.840
Is there anything
that would make you feel better?

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.760
Not really, no.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.000
Part of me just wants to sleep.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.560
But a part of me...

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.120
doesn't know what to do.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.760
I almost wish that if I had it my way,
none of you would know.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.160
And I'd be able to get the help
without any of you knowing.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:34.640
'Cause it just feels so uncomfortable,
and I'm just embarrassed that...

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.720
But don't be embarrassed, Pippa.

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.840
- It's an illness, it's not...
- I know, but...

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:41.440
I'm putting the family through some shit.
And some of you don't...

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.560
Like, and it's not your fault,
but they don't understand that

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.360
I can't help it.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.600
You hope that
you've brought them up to treasure life.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.320
That's your job as a parent.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:10.280
It's the last thing I want,
but she does need to be in hospital.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.240
What are you doing?

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.640
I was just putting things in here.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.000
- It's not the same without her, is it?
- No.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.120
You all take
a different thing away with you.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.960
Pippa,
it's like that sparky-ness has gone.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.880
What do I take away with me?

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:37.920
"Sorry."

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.080
It just says sorry.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:51.640
There's blood.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.280
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.600
So, like, a few weeks ago,
I wrote one poem.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.560
Can I see it?

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.240
Don't read it out loud.
And don't move your lips.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.640
- And don't, like, look at me.
- I won't read it out or look at you.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.520
The theme was wonder,

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.000
and I did it more on the topic
of being abandoned...

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.000
sort of the feelings that go
with being left by someone and...

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.800
the sort of wondering about
whether they feel the same way you do

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.200
and whether it's the same story
on both sides.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.320
Everything in my life,

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.560
the one thing that I couldn't control
in regards to my emotions

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:15.640
was having my heart broken.

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.720
And no song, no poem, no movie

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.880
can ever describe to a person
how much it hurts.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.840
I think it has made me understand
maybe why Mum stayed with Dad,

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.280
even when things got difficult.

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.440
'Cause I have found
that when it was getting difficult,

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.600
I still wanted to carry on.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.480
When I really feel over it,
I'll get the answers I'm looking for.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.800
Well, I'll either get the answers
I'm looking for,

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:49.080
or I won't even want answers anymore.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.520
But I already know, either way,
it doesn't matter, does it?

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.520
As long as one of them happens,
I'll be happy.

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:07.760
Today, we have a family therapy team

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.280
coming over to have a meeting
or a session with all of us

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.440
to talk about...

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.760
...mostly the day that Paul died.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.920
To try and help Pippa, really,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.600
to come to terms with that day
and how everyone felt and how she felt

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.040
and what she remembers from it,

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.480
because she was only six.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.920
We talk about that day a lot.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.160
But we've never, actually,
all of us spoken, as a family.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.520
We can fit 13 people here.

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.320
It was a group experience but it
was also a very individual experience,

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.640
and it was Pippa herself who asked for it.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.360
Are we talking about this day
as if it happened yesterday?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.200
I think that year is such a blank
because Paul was...

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.400
- It was a very strange year.
- I left preschool that year.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.400
- Did you?
- It's funny...

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.520
- That was real.
- Forgot about that until just now!

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.240
I don't ever go inside.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:15.080
We didn't imagine that happening.
That did happen.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.040
I remember Mum saying,
"You know Dad's been ill."

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.240
And then you were like, "I'm so sorry."
And you started crying.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.480
I just was sad.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.800
Waking up the next day
thinking it was a dream.

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.040
I don't remember hitting
Mum's car. Was I hitting Mum's car?

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.360
Going back to school and...

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:33.400
people were pretending
to slit their wrists 'cause they knew.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.720
It was in the paper.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.680
I felt like I had to cry
'cause you kept passing me tissues.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.440
I wasn't really crying.

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:44.560
I was pretending to cry
because I wanted to be involved.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.280
We all have things in that day
that, you know, if, if, if...

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:59.760
But it's what did happen
that we should try and focus on

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.640
because the ifs will just mess you up.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.320
As long as we stand together,
we're okay.

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.960
It's so useful
because we've never done this.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.120
We've never heard
everyone's individual story

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.920
and I think it's really good.

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.240
Pipsy? Hello!

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.480
- Hi!
- Is it gonna make her upset?

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.720
No, this will make her happy,

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.640
'cause she thought
she had a bad relationship with Dad,

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.560
but we're showing her
all the bits that are good.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.200
She's so cute.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.400
I tell you what,
I just want her to be her natural self.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.280
How are you doing now, Pippa?

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.920
Do you know what? I think
every time you've asked me that question,

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.520
I've always said, "Pretty shit."

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.640
But this one, I think, like...

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:57.320
I'm actually okay.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.480
And I feel as though...

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.560
I'm on the right track
for, like, the first time in my life.

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.080
I've been in hospital almost six months.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.520
I'm doing better,

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.080
but I'm not getting discharged
anytime soon.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.520
I don't know.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.280
It is so hard to acknowledge
that something's wrong.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.640
Because you can't admit it to yourself.
You're like, "No, I'm fine."

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.360
I don't think that you'll ever know
what you need.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.480
I think that's a decision you need
someone else to make for you.

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.680
You know,
people die from not accepting help.

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.320
You know,
and we've all experienced that firsthand.

01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.960
Oh, my God.

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.640
With death,
it's difficult because...

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:09.200
I could live my life being angry
at my dad and never forgive him.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.960
But all that means is that I'm just
gonna be an angry person all the time.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:20.440
Whereas I want to feel happiness
and freedom and peace and love.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:29.280
- Am I gonna die up here?
- Yeah, the thing is cursed.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.960
I dare you to jump. Jump!

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:34.040
I'm still just as wimpy as I used to be.

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.560
- Nothing has changed.
- Nothing's changed, Pip!

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.680
You can do it, girls!

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.680
Come on, Mirie!

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.440
That's it! Don't give up!

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.280
I think we're very lucky
to have had the life we've had.

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.160
Being able to play in the land,
and having so many siblings, and just...

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.280
There's a lot of happy memories,
and I think that's a sign

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.600
of a very lucky upbringing.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.240
Bad things happen, but...

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.200
holding on to the happy memories, but...

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.760
letting the bad ones
help you move forward.

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.320
And helping you to learn for
different situations that happen in life.
