00:02.560 --> 00:05.200
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.560
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.640
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.800
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.800 --> 00:19.560
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.360
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:37.760 --> 00:40.840
My best friend Ray 
 think it's cool.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.520
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.600
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.920
Not even my parents.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.880
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:53.880 --> 00:55.920
and turn me into some experiment.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.240
But you know something?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.560
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.680
So, clearly, whoever pulled 
 that fire alarm last week

01:09.680 --> 01:14.080
when there was no fire commited 
 a very serious offense.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.880
That's right, Miss Hamilton.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.640
You know, it's not only stupid 
 and illegal, it's dangerous.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.040
Now will be a good time 
 to talk about fire prevention.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.880
[Miss Hamilton] Please remove 
 those bracelets, Miss Flanders.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.120
This is history class, 
 not band practice.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.160
Now, what is your question?

01:32.160 --> 01:36.640
I was hoping we could see 
 Firefighter Pruitt's helmet.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.360
Of course.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.840
Okay, fire prevention.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.920
Let's talk about outlets...

01:43.920 --> 01:46.280
extension cords, flammable liquids...

01:46.280 --> 01:51.440
heaters, waste baskets... 
 axes, axes...

01:52.560 --> 01:56.040
Axes... extension cords...

01:56.040 --> 01:59.360
gasoline... nitro...

02:02.760 --> 02:04.480
Fire!

02:05.120 --> 02:08.639
[screaming] 
 I'll get the fire extinguisher!

02:08.639 --> 02:10.880
[alarm ringing]

02:10.880 --> 02:13.680
Wait! The door is stuck!

02:17.680 --> 02:22.000
Let me try, it's my job.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.120
[gasps]

02:24.600 --> 02:26.720
[both screaming]

02:32.880 --> 02:34.720
Alex?

02:41.520 --> 02:45.040
Back away, everyone, 
 I'll get this under control.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.200
Go for it, Alex!

02:47.200 --> 02:52.360
I'm just doing what anyone else 
 would do if they were me.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.200
Wow.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.120
Miss Mack, you're... you're...

03:14.120 --> 03:16.440
You're a hero, is what you are.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.160
It was nothing.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.160
I think you deserve 
 this more than me.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.480
For her courage 
 in the face of real danger.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.240
Ms. Mack. 
 Her selfless act of bravery.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.960
Ms. Mack. 
 Her unrivaled...

03:33.960 --> 03:37.720
Ms. Mack, Ms. Mack. 
 Ms. Mack?

03:37.720 --> 03:39.800
Miss Mack?

03:39.800 --> 03:42.920
Ms. Mack! Alexandra.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.600
I think Firefighter Pruitt 
 might like her helmet back.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.440
[class snickering]

03:54.360 --> 03:55.400
Thank you.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.120
I think we've learned a lot 
 about fire safety

03:58.120 --> 04:00.880
and the dangers 
 of pulling false alarms

04:00.880 --> 04:02.600
from Lieutenant Pruitt.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.320
Let's all thank her for being here.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.080
- [applause] 
 - Oh, and by the way, class

04:08.080 --> 04:11.360
our first mid-term exam 
 will be held next Monday.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.200
[groaning]

04:13.200 --> 04:14.920
That's right, people.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.839
- Yes, Miss Flanders? 
 - What's a mid-term?

04:19.839 --> 04:23.920
Well, it's an evil plot 
 to make you learn everything

04:23.920 --> 04:28.400
and I mean everything 
 we've covered in class so far.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.720
Multiple choice and one 
 open-book essay question

04:32.720 --> 04:35.160
requiring genuine thought.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.880
Be prepared.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.000
Wow, our first mid-term.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.960
As soon as you get out of 
 elementary school, it gets ugly.

04:43.960 --> 04:48.280
Well, I think this whole testing 
 thing is destroying our creativity.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.400
I mean, multiple choice questions?

04:50.400 --> 04:51.760
That's so... retro.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.080
- Hi, Libby. 
 - Hey.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.880
Um, I really glad you asked 
 what a mid-term was.

04:57.880 --> 05:02.240
- I wasn't quite so sure myself. 
 - Actually, I was just kidding.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.600
Jocelyn, Neil, wait up for moi!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.440
What a jerk.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.040
I know, I sounded like a major idiot.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.560
Not you-- Libby.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.200
Really, "Wait up for moi?" 
 Please!

05:15.200 --> 05:18.560
You guys are just jealous. 
 She's the most popular girl.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.800
So what? 
 Popularity is so... retro.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.480
Yeah.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.760
If that's retro, 
 I want to be retro.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.720
[Libby] 
 I know it sometimes seems like

05:33.720 --> 05:36.080
I'm not paying attention, 
 but I am.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.840
I mean, I love history. 
 It's important to me that I do well.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.760
Really? I had no idea.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.080
The french revolution's so interesting--

05:44.080 --> 05:46.960
the most fascinating 
 historical event ever.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.360
I agree.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.680
[Libby] I was wondering 
 is there any additional reading

05:51.680 --> 05:53.680
that might help me prepare 
 for the mid-term?

05:53.680 --> 05:55.040
Of course there is.

05:55.040 --> 05:59.040
Here's a list of french 
 revolution- related material.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.760
All of these books are 
 available in the library.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.880
Great, I was just 
 on my way there now.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.400
Thanks a lot, Miss Hamilton.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.800
- See you on Monday. 
 - Thank you, Libby. Good luck.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.920
Mr. Alvarado, perhaps you 
 should consider putting in

06:20.920 --> 06:25.560
the same sort of effort 
 that Miss Flanders is.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.880
Hey, Libby, wait up.

06:51.200 --> 06:55.320
- What's up, Rodney? 
 - That's Raymond and you dropped this.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.520
Yeah, so?

06:56.520 --> 06:59.360
Don't you need it 
 to do additional reading?

06:59.360 --> 07:02.560
I got plans tonight. 
 Reading will interfere with them.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.520
But I thought you...

07:04.520 --> 07:08.160
Could I make it any clearer to you?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.440
[rock music playing]

07:43.600 --> 07:45.960
Alex seems pretty worried.

07:45.960 --> 07:51.080
Of course she's worried. 
 She's never had a mid-term before.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.480
I remember my first mid-term. 
 Miss Boarcow, chem 101.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.960
I committed the periodic table 
 of elements to memory

07:57.960 --> 07:59.280
by giving it a Melody.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.000
For my first mid-term 
 you taught it to me.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.360
Hey... [humming]

08:03.360 --> 08:06.000
# Hydrogen, helium, 
 lithium, beryllium #

08:06.000 --> 08:07.960
# Boring, carbon, nitrogen #

08:07.960 --> 08:10.480
[inhaling] # Oxygen! #

08:10.480 --> 08:12.520
So of course you both aced it.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.440
Uh, Miss Boarcow graded 
 on the curve.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.360
The other kids never forgave me 
 for getting all the answers.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.120
I know the feeling. 
 Genius can be lonely.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.960
Alex is keeping up. 
 Don't you think?

08:24.960 --> 08:28.360
[Annie] Mom, if she doesn't 
 know the material by now

08:28.360 --> 08:30.000
it's probably hopeless.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.240
Flashcards are 
 excellent learning tools.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.480
- I'll help her prepare some. 
 - No, leave her alone.

08:35.480 --> 08:39.640
You two are just going 
 to make her more nervous.

09:09.080 --> 09:13.000
[Alex] 1792, the Reign of Terror, 
 Madame Guillotine--

09:13.000 --> 09:16.720
Oh, why do I feel like 
 I'm going to be sick?

09:16.720 --> 09:19.120
Relax, Al, it's just a mid-term.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.760
If you're like this now, 
 how will you be able

09:22.760 --> 09:25.240
to get to-- da-dum-- 
 final exams?

09:25.240 --> 09:29.240
I'll probably 
 be hospitalized by then.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.840
Ready?

09:31.840 --> 09:34.160
I hate this, ooh, I hate this.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.800
Look at you, look at what 
 this pressure is doing to us.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.000
It's not right.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.480
Now, this is supposed to be 
 a safe environment, a community.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.680
We should feel free to risk 
 to... to grow, to fail.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.880
Do you have to use that word?

09:50.880 --> 09:52.600
Look at Libby Flanders.

09:52.600 --> 09:56.800
Wouldn't it be cool 
 to be so cool about it all?

09:56.800 --> 10:02.000
I wouldn't be surprised 
 if she's in an extreme case of denial.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.520
You sure you won't 
 float the answers

10:04.520 --> 10:06.560
off Miss Hamilton's desk to us?

10:06.560 --> 10:10.720
Right now I'd do almost anything 
 to get out of taking this thing.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.480
Oh, no!

10:13.120 --> 10:17.720
I forgot my book for the big essay 
 and my number two pencils.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.800
I'm not cut out for mid-terms. 
 I'm a wreck!

10:20.800 --> 10:22.640
You should calm down

10:22.640 --> 10:28.160
but you only have 20 seconds 
 to get to your locker and back.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.800
[alarm ringing]

10:55.880 --> 11:00.120
[alarm continues ringing]

11:10.160 --> 11:12.280
I forgot number two pencils.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.080
And you thought you might 
 find them at the alarm box.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.880
[alarm ringing]

11:29.240 --> 11:32.760
- Where did Alex go? 
 - I don't know.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.600
- [alarm stops] 
 - Is that all you can say for yourself?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.000
It's not how to looks.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.480
I forgot about the open-book essay...

11:41.480 --> 11:45.240
- So you were ill-prepared. 
 - I forgot my book...

11:45.240 --> 11:49.360
And you decided to delay 
 the test for everyone else.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.240
No, that's not it. 
 I was just at my locker...

11:52.240 --> 11:55.640
First, you will complete 
 you own personal fire drill.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.360
After we go back in 
 we'll go to the principal's office

11:59.360 --> 12:02.560
and you can explain 
 the whole thing there.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.280
Miss Hamilton?!

12:22.800 --> 12:26.920
I didn't exactly study, 
 if you know what I mean.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.480
It really wasn't on 
 my list of priorities.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.840
We need to talk.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.720
Not now, Alice, 
 I'm kind of busy here.

12:35.720 --> 12:41.240
That's Alex... 
 and we really need to talk.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.440
- Guess you forgot something. 
 - Thanks.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.080
Where did you find it?

12:56.520 --> 12:59.920
- You want a reward? 
 - A confession.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.800
I found it where you 
 didn't mean to leave it.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.120
Excuse me?

13:04.120 --> 13:06.760
I was at the wrong place 
 at the wrong time.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.120
Now Hamilton thinks 
 I pulled the alarm.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.520
Well, I didn't do anything, 
 and you can't prove I did.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.960
Wouldn't you rather confess 
 than have me tell on you?

13:15.960 --> 13:19.080
That was a pretty extreme way 
 of getting out of a test.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.000
Alex, how can I expect you 
 to understand?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.840
I choked, plain and simple.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.720
I mean, our first big test, 
 you know?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
Yeah.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.720
Sometimes I wish 
 I could be more like you.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.560
You wish you could be 
 more like me?

13:36.560 --> 13:37.920
You're so real.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.960
You don't worry about 
 being popular and stuff.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.360
- I really admire your courage. 
 - Courage? Me?

13:45.360 --> 13:47.240
You're the type of person

13:47.240 --> 13:51.440
who stands up for what she 
 believes and fights for the Underdog.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.680
I could never ask you 
 to take the fall for me.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.880
[choking up]: That would be 
 just asking too much.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.680
You're so good 
 and I deserve what I get.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.480
So go ahead and tell on me, Alex.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.240
I understand. 
 Go ahead.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.920
[sighs] 
 I'll see what I can do.

14:19.560 --> 14:23.320
It wasn't me, 
 but I can't tell you who it was.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.880
I don't know.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.120
I really can't say.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.120
I can't answer that.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.600
I'm going to have to 
 plead the fifth.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.200
If I have to take the blame...

14:49.200 --> 14:51.160
I will.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.600
[Libby] So, from what I hear, 
 Alex Mack pulled the alarm.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.280
Miss Goody Two-Shoes 
 couldn't handle the pressure.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.800
You never expect it-- 
 the quiet ones.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.080
She going to be so busted.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.320
Class, due to 
 the reprehensible actions

15:14.320 --> 15:18.480
of one of your schoolmates, 
 who shall remain nameless

15:18.480 --> 15:20.880
I'm postponing your exam 
 till Friday.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.880
- [cheering] 
 - Same time, same place...

15:24.880 --> 15:27.760
- twice as hard. 
 - [groaning]

15:27.760 --> 15:32.160
And we will all look forward 
 to Miss Mack's

15:32.160 --> 15:35.480
oral report on fires through history.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.640
Extensive library research required.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.400
- [class bell rings] 
 - Class dismissed.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.680
[Ray] 
 What is Miss Hamilton talking about?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.960
There's no way 
 you pulled that thing.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.840
No, but if I have to 
 take the blame, I will.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.840
- What?! 
 - Alex... you're the coolest.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.400
- Oh, no, really, I... 
 - Take it.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.240
- We have to hang out soon. 
 - Really?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.280
Absolutement.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.080
Libby Flanders?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.200
You're covering up for Libby Flanders?

16:11.200 --> 16:13.880
Why take the fall for such a snoot?

16:13.880 --> 16:16.440
There were... 
 extentuating circumstances

16:16.440 --> 16:19.840
or whatever you call them. 
 Libby's actually very nice.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.680
If she had any character 
 she would turn herself in.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.440
She was going to, 
 but I wouldn't let her.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.480
It's complicated. 
 You have to trust me on this.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.280
We trust you.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.280
We just don't trust her.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.720
You can't understand.

16:34.720 --> 16:39.080
I'm just trying to have 
 a little courage and compassion.

16:40.160 --> 16:46.320
Nothing like courage, compassion... 
 and instant popularity.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.160
[doorbell ringing]

16:55.960 --> 16:59.480
- Hey, Annie! 
 - Ray... what are you doing here?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.200
We're going to study.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.840
Big history mid-term coming up.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.040
Yeah, I've heard rumors 
 to that effect.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.760
Go on up. 
 She's already up there

17:09.760 --> 17:14.240
- with, uh... Lily Flanders. 
 - Libby Flanders is up there?!

17:17.520 --> 17:19.480
Forget about it.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.599
[dialing]

17:29.880 --> 17:31.760
Why do I have to call him?

17:31.760 --> 17:34.960
Because he already knows 
 everyone else's voice.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.320
- [phone ringing] 
 - I have to hang up.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.200
Oh, come on, don't be a chicken.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.080
[phone ringing]

17:44.080 --> 17:45.200
Hello?

17:45.200 --> 17:48.160
Um... hi, uh, Greg?

17:48.160 --> 17:52.000
- Yeah, this is Greg. 
 - Somebody likes you.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.600
[laughing]

17:53.600 --> 17:57.200
Alex, we are going to have 
 a lot of fun together.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.360
[girls laughing]

18:06.840 --> 18:10.240
All these dates 
 swimming through my head.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.720
- History is way too historical. 
 - It's weird.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.160
I'm not really nervous this time.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.240
I guess my nerves 
 are already maxed out.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.720
Hey, you guys know 
 where Alex is?

18:21.720 --> 18:24.800
You would know 
 better than we would.

18:24.800 --> 18:30.080
I can't believe Alex would makes 
 friends with such a phony.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.800
See, Libby's got what they call a... 
 cult of personality.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.680
Those like Alex who are 
 unsure of themselves

18:38.680 --> 18:43.320
gravitate to people like... her.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.280
I'm going to get some water.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.280
I'll be right back.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.280
- [Libby] It's all set up. 
 - [girl] Excellent.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.480
It's amazing how you found 
 such a willing victim.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.080
We just have to figure out 
 what to do

19:00.080 --> 19:03.440
with all the time 
 we used to spend studying.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.510
Oh!

19:11.520 --> 19:13.080
[no dialogue]

19:19.720 --> 19:23.680
- Alex, we got to talk to you! 
 - I have to get my stuff.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.920
Alex, listen.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.800
Want to bet the alarm 
 goes off during the test?

19:27.800 --> 19:32.160
- Nobody would be that obvious. 
 - No? How about Libby?

19:32.160 --> 19:35.400
- What are you talking about? 
 - Listen and listen fast.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.840
I just heard them.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.160
Libby thinks you're a sucker 
 with a captial "S."

19:40.160 --> 19:43.480
- She's going to pull that alarm. 
 - No way.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.320
Yes, way.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.920
[alarm ringing]

20:39.920 --> 20:42.160
- Libby? 
 - Alex!

20:42.160 --> 20:43.640
I can't believe this.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.160
Neither will anyone else.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.320
Sorry, Alex, but you 
 just made it so easy.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.480
- [zapping] 
 - Whoa...

20:53.480 --> 20:56.320
Oh... Hey, what is this?!

20:57.840 --> 20:59.680
Alex?!

21:00.520 --> 21:03.640
You might want this back.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.320
Hold it right there, 
 Miss Flanders!

21:10.320 --> 21:12.600
It wasn't me, I swear.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.160
- It isn't polite to swear. 
 - It was Alex Mack.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.920
I tried to stop her.

21:21.920 --> 21:26.200
She put that bracelet there 
 and she's hiding inside that locker.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.360
Open the door, you'll see.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.200
- This doesn't make any sense. 
 - No, it doesn't.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.920
Miss Hamilton, 
 I don't know what's going on...

21:41.920 --> 21:45.640
Save it for the principal. 
 Follow me, young lady.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.600
You can collect your exams 
 on the way out.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.680
It was almost worth the wait.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.320
You all did quite well for yourselves.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.160
- [class bell rings] 
 - Nice work.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.760
Nice work, Miss Mack.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.240
My tricks is studying 
 for the same test three times.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.280
And never mind that oral report.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.480
- I gave it to someone else. 
 - Is Libby okay?

22:18.480 --> 22:20.640
Punishment can lead to growth.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.160
Libby will be spending a 
 lot of time in the library.

22:24.160 --> 22:29.080
And maybe you'll think twice 
 before taking tha fall for someone.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.520
I think I will.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.880
Hate to say we told you so, 
 Alex, but we told you so.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.160
All right, so she's a slime ball.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.720
[Libby] 
 Listen, Alex...

22:44.720 --> 22:47.480
you may think you're smart, 
 but we both know

22:47.480 --> 22:49.720
there's something weird about you.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.560
I don't what it is yet, 
 but when I do

22:52.560 --> 22:55.680
I promise you, you're dead.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.160
What a delightful girl she is.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.120
And what is she talking about, Alex?

23:03.040 --> 23:05.600
I have no idea.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.000
- [laughing] 
 - Wait for me.
