15:50.125 --> 15:51.500
Are you okay,
little girl?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.875
I have a panic button
in my costume,

15:52.875 --> 15:54.166
and I'm not afraid
to use it.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.208
I think
the appropriate response

15:57.208 --> 16:00.208
would be to ask me
if I'm also okay.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.792

16:02.792 --> 16:04.333
HEATHER: They just
scored a touchdown.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.792
TIM: Which is worth how much?

16:05.792 --> 16:08.375
SOPHIA: Six. Until
they make an extra point

16:08.375 --> 16:10.166
or a two-point conversion.

I know, sweetie.

an affair this weekend,

at having affairs.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.375
Suckers!

17:43.375 --> 17:45.417
Do you think you could
get these seats again?

17:45.417 --> 17:47.375
Um, I don't, but mostly
because I made up

17:47.375 --> 17:49.500
that thing about these
being our season tickets.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.542
These were just two
random open seats.

-Yeah.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.667
Okay, worst case scenario,
an usher comes,

18:03.667 --> 18:05.083
politely asks us
to leave,

18:05.083 --> 18:07.583

We don't have

18:39.417 --> 18:40.709
How did you do that?

18:40.709 --> 18:42.875
How did you know
they were bluffing?

18:42.875 --> 18:44.792
Because half their
faces were sunburnt.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.250
They were clearly up there
in the nosebleeds with us.

Anyway, um, I think all this
is a little too much for me,

19:03.208 --> 19:05.667
so I'm gonna go home
and think of ways

19:05.667 --> 19:07.709

to the community.
