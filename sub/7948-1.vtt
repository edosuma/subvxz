03:05.084 --> 03:08.713
<i>He's ahead of the field, blazing in.</i>
<i>Lakers by seven!</i>

03:08.821 --> 03:11.449
<i>This is Marv Albert from the Forum in LA.</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:14.618
<i>And the Knicks in big trouble</i>
<i>as they move to the front court.</i>

03:14.727 --> 03:17.662
<i>Going from right to left</i>
<i>Cummings takes the one-bounce.</i>

03:17.730 --> 03:21.757
<i>A flip for King. It's batted away!</i>
<i>Magic Johnson on the steal!</i>

03:21.868 --> 03:25.429
<i>He's down the left side and goes baseline!</i>
<i>He's trapped! Throws back out.</i>

03:25.538 --> 03:28.735
<i>To Worthy. A head-fake,</i>
<i>now the jumper. It is good!</i>

03:28.841 --> 03:32.538
<i>Only 10 seconds left.</i>
<i>The Lakers are burying the Knicks!</i>

03:32.645 --> 03:36.581
<i>The Knicks have come back from the dead</i>
<i>before, but not tonight!</i>

03:50.730 --> 03:51.856
<i>2L-16, Tack 2.</i>

03:56.469 --> 03:57.993
<i>Come in, 2L-16.</i>

04:00.940 --> 04:02.805
<i>Respond, 2L-16.</i>

04:06.045 --> 04:09.981
<i>Sergeant Leary says to remind you,</i>
<i>you owe him $50 on tonight's game.</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:14.019
<i>And that he'd be happy to take</i>
<i>your money on the Knicks anytime.</i>

05:06.072 --> 05:07.039
Come on!

05:07.807 --> 05:08.933
Give it to him!

05:09.042 --> 05:10.509
Where is it?

05:11.244 --> 05:15.476
Give me what's mine, you understand?
It's mine and I want it now!

05:17.183 --> 05:21.745
Look at this! Look what I found.
This is mine, baby.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.153
Freeze!

05:31.064 --> 05:34.591
All right, hands out of your pockets,
away from your body.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.963
Suck wall!

05:38.137 --> 05:40.935
Get your feet back. Back! And spread them!

05:44.544 --> 05:46.774
All right, wider! I said, wider!

05:49.015 --> 05:52.781
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
picking on a guy half your size.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.578
- Nice shot, kid!
- Good shot, Joey.

06:05.598 --> 06:06.758
Hit him!

07:35.321 --> 07:36.754
Don't move.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.887
Don't even breathe.

09:12.818 --> 09:16.845
We have come to mourn and honor
not only the passing of a friend...

09:17.456 --> 09:19.788
but of a fine police officer.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.123
An officer who was an example to us all.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.355
Samuel Edward Makin died as he lived...

09:28.267 --> 09:30.258
defending the American way.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.870
That is why I feel more pride than sorrow.

09:34.173 --> 09:37.074
For Samuel Makin made
the ultimate sacrifice.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.470
He did so willingly...

09:40.146 --> 09:42.376
and no man can hope to do more.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.143
His body may be returned to the earth...

09:45.251 --> 09:47.742
but his spirit will live forever.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.186
We, your fellow officers...

09:50.823 --> 09:52.222
salute you, Sam.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.820
Your duty done...

09:55.261 --> 09:56.922
may you rest in peace.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.223
Ready...

09:59.432 --> 10:01.161
aim, fire!

10:12.812 --> 10:14.336
I was shaving you.

10:18.117 --> 10:18.811
Where am I?

10:18.918 --> 10:21.853
Now don't worry.
Everything's going to be just fine.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.020
That's not me!

10:32.231 --> 10:34.199
What the hell have you done to me?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.029
We did some work on you.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.938
Just your face. Thank you, Nurse.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.937
You'd better have had a damn good reason.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.307
We did.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.245
You were ugly.

10:49.515 --> 10:50.482
Who's we?

10:50.583 --> 10:54.314
You've been recruited
by an organization that doesn't exist.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.920
Sam Makin is dead, pal.

10:55.988 --> 11:00.118
Some nasty man shoved him
and his police cruiser into the East River.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.456
I'm a pretty healthy corpse.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.961
The operative word is "corpse."

11:05.531 --> 11:09.126
You've got a new face, new fingerprints,
even a new name.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.101
Williams...

11:11.370 --> 11:13.099
Remo Williams.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.932
A lot of thought went into it.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.276
We needed someone,
and you were the best we could find.

11:21.380 --> 11:25.180
Decorated cop, ex-Marine,
no family, no commitments.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.587
If I'm the best you can find,
you're in pretty deep shit, pal.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.157
Who the hell are you, anyway?
FBI? CIA? Salvation Army?

11:32.258 --> 11:36.786
Who we are, are the people
who got you by the balls, Remo.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.360
Besides, we need you.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.297
Our cops are corrupt, our judges
are bought, our politicians are up for sale.

11:45.404 --> 11:48.305
Everywhere you look, slime is on the loose.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.043
You're going to be
the Eleventh Commandment.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.208
"Thou shalt not get away with it."

11:58.217 --> 12:01.345
You're the guy that set me up
in that warehouse, ain't you?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.316
Nice job.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.356
The name's MacCleary.
We'll get to know each other.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.424
Enjoy the fruit...

12:12.932 --> 12:13.990
Remo.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.100
Jeez!

12:35.154 --> 12:37.145
There you go, Mr. Mossler.

12:37.356 --> 12:41.019
Soon you're gonna be
as snug as a little old bug in a rug.

12:45.231 --> 12:48.200
Where the hell are you going
with my ambulance?

13:02.214 --> 13:04.682
Turn left at the next intersection...

13:06.285 --> 13:07.047
Remo.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.173
Don't get any cute ideas, Remo.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.910
"National Bank"?

13:43.589 --> 13:46.217
- What, are you opening an account for me?
- Let's go.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.172
What do these things do?

14:01.540 --> 14:03.633
Keep track of your wardrobe?

14:04.476 --> 14:07.138
I thought they figured out a way
to make them smaller.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.271
These are the smaller ones.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.736
- Come in, Mr...
- Williams, Remo Williams.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.206
Good evening, Mr. Williams.

14:46.452 --> 14:50.684
I'm Harold Smith. I'm the head
of the organization that just recruited you.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.755
You call dumping me in the river
and reshuffling my face recruitment?

14:55.094 --> 14:57.153
Yep. It works. Sit down.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.230
Come on, my boy.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.732
I know your ribs are hurting
like a son of a bitch.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.326
Now sit down a minute.
Make yourself comfortable.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.396
I'll tell you a little bit
about the way we work here.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.176
Yeah, I've seen how you work.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.643
You run black-bag operations,
you kidnap people.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.237
You beat them up,
and nobody holds you accountable.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.339
We're accountable, Mr. Williams.

15:18.450 --> 15:21.442
- Let me guess. To the President.
- Yep.

15:22.454 --> 15:26.390
And five of them before him.
I've lost track. I don't even vote anymore.

15:26.492 --> 15:30.292
Sorry to disappoint you.
I'm voting with my feet.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.370
Now you want to sit down?

15:50.149 --> 15:52.413
I'm only going to say this once.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.720
This is a wonderful country...

15:55.821 --> 15:59.257
but our legal system doesn't work
the way it's supposed to.

15:59.591 --> 16:03.652
I'm talking about people
who roam the halls of power with impunity.

16:04.797 --> 16:09.666
Who corrupt and subvert the very principles
our constitution exists to uphold.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.328
Your friend already gave me
the Gettysburg Address.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.405
Has he?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.502
Here's another one.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.338
"Guard, protect and cherish your land...

16:20.446 --> 16:24.542
"for there is no afterlife
for a place that started out as Heaven."

16:26.185 --> 16:28.676
Charles M. Russell, Montana, 1926.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.286
1926?

16:31.790 --> 16:33.621
That's ancient history, Dad.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.293
The computer said you were a smart-ass.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.763
And you never heard of computer error?

16:39.865 --> 16:41.389
Not this one.

16:42.201 --> 16:45.261
Take a look at that innocent little box,
my boy.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.738
It's hooked to all those
computers you saw downstairs.

16:49.842 --> 16:54.302
Every scrap of processed information
in the United States comes through here.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.643
If it's out there, I can find it.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.445
It helps us keep track of the bad guys.

16:59.651 --> 17:04.645
I can find out the temperature of your ass
in that chair, if I really want to know.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.782
But it won't do everything.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.789
And that's why we got you here,
Mr. Williams.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.390
You're going to help remove
some of the filth in there.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.368
I like that. That's nice.

17:17.970 --> 17:22.906
It's a lot nicer than "kill," or "destroy,"
or "terminate with extreme prejudice."

17:23.809 --> 17:26.334
That's what you're really talking about,
isn't it?

17:26.412 --> 17:28.539
I think he's got it, Mr. Smith.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.214
That's exactly what we're talking about,
Mr. Williams.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.348
Suppose I say no?

17:33.452 --> 17:35.784
Then you're a dead son of a bitch.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.422
And we already got a coffin.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.386
How big is this organization?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.327
Just the three of us.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.830
Mac here
will get you cleaned up and briefed.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.397
You start work Monday night, Mr. Williams.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.720
Here we are.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.753
Nice pad.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.962
First hit. No big deal. You'll get used to it.

18:24.636 --> 18:27.332
Nothing like throwing in a man
at the deep end.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.640
What's this guy done that's so special?

18:31.743 --> 18:35.543
Come on, Remo, we run
on a need-to-know basis. You know that.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.946
Don't take any chances. This guy's a killer.

18:49.895 --> 18:50.486
Remember...

18:50.963 --> 18:52.931
in, out, like a duck mating.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.940
- Where are you gonna be?
- Right behind you.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.498
How do you open this?

20:48.714 --> 20:50.079
Speak English?

20:51.183 --> 20:53.117
Does a nightingale sing?

20:55.954 --> 20:57.046
Yeah...

20:57.990 --> 21:01.687
- How do you get out of here?
- The same way you came in.

21:03.028 --> 21:03.619
No good.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.630
There's a guy outside
who wants me to knock off your boss.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.529
I am here alone.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.539
There is no one upstairs.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.051
Okay, now look, let's not make
any trouble for each other.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.780
All I wanna do is to get out of here.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.623
It is too late for that.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.926
Hold it! I don't want to kill you,
but I will if I have to.

23:06.084 --> 23:09.247
I'll show you chop-socky,
you sawed-off little runt.

23:57.335 --> 24:00.065
Chiun, what do you think?

24:01.106 --> 24:02.733
He is very slow.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.034
His reflexes are pitiful.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.040
Poorly coordinated.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.637
He is in wretched physical condition.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.648
Impetuous.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.980
And clumsy.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.882
He moves like a baboon with two club feet.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.286
However...

24:22.093 --> 24:25.961
there is a feeble glint of promise in his eyes.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.659
I think I can do something with him.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.027
Good.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.773
<i>George S. Grove.</i>

24:35.841 --> 24:39.106
<i>Born Albany, New York, May 10, 1933.</i>

24:39.778 --> 24:42.679

25:23.088 --> 25:26.319

25:28.059 --> 25:30.789
<i>No charges were filed for lack of evidence.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:34.028
<i>They disappeared, too.</i>

25:34.432 --> 25:37.924
<i>If the Company can't get anything on Grove,</i>
<i>then you know he's good.</i>

25:38.036 --> 25:40.129
All I can promise is terror for breakfast...

25:40.238 --> 25:42.798
pressure for lunch,
and aggravation for sleep.

25:42.908 --> 25:46.674
Your vacations will be two minutes
when you're not looking over your shoulder.

25:46.745 --> 25:49.873
If you live to draw a pension,
it'll be a miracle.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.006
Are there any disadvantages?

25:52.117 --> 25:54.813
Hell, I'm lucky I've lasted this long.

26:00.091 --> 26:02.218
Tell me something, MacCleary.

26:02.761 --> 26:06.424
- Can you dodge bullets?
- Nowadays, only if they come real slow.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.698
Do I really have to live with him?

26:11.770 --> 26:14.864
Chiun's probably
not crazy about the idea either.

26:15.173 --> 26:18.336
He says you smell like hamburgers.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.809
Top floor.

26:20.278 --> 26:21.472
See you.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.040
MacCleary.

26:26.217 --> 26:30.051
If this turns out to be another set up,
you won't live to collect a pension.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.180
I personally guarantee it.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.385
Didn't I tell you,
we don't use that bang-bang stuff.

26:35.493 --> 26:38.360
Your mind and your body
become your weapon.

26:38.463 --> 26:41.864
That's what your new pal Chiun
is going to teach you.

27:14.499 --> 27:17.935
Okay, so you caught me
with a couple of lucky shots.

27:18.169 --> 27:22.265
But I got to hand it to you,
that bullet-dodging number wasn't bad.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.737
I like the little thing you did with the gun.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.909
You move like a pregnant yak.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.006
Sit.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.902
- Breathe.
- Breathe?

27:56.141 --> 27:58.132
- Come on, you got to...
- Silence!

27:58.243 --> 28:02.043
The fool chatters
but it is the wise man that listens.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.345
Breathe.

28:19.497 --> 28:23.058
Wait, is this the kind of training
where we sit around for 10 years...

28:23.168 --> 28:26.569
and you tell me I'm big enough
to break a brick with my big toe?

28:32.911 --> 28:35.471
You have come into the care of Chiun...

28:36.181 --> 28:38.149
Master of Sinanju.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.114
Sinanju is a village in Korea...

28:42.253 --> 28:44.949
where all the fighting arts were born.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.258
Kung fu, karate...

28:48.026 --> 28:49.220
ninjitsu.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.529
They are all but shadows.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.160
Sinanju is the sun.

28:55.467 --> 28:58.334
Most intelligent people know this already.

28:58.570 --> 29:03.064
But it is apparent to me that you know
less than nothing. Pay attention.

29:03.575 --> 29:08.308
You did not ask to be white,
so perhaps that is not your fault.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.005
You did not ask to be here.

29:11.216 --> 29:15.152
Perhaps that is not your fault, either.
So let us make this pact.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.184
I will train you for your first service.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.352
And then, I will return to my country.

29:30.969 --> 29:33.335
Pressure. Nerve ends.

29:33.638 --> 29:34.969
Sinanju.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.065
Technique developed
since the birth of time...

29:39.210 --> 29:42.111
by the most gifted race on Earth.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.574
You always talk
like a Chinese fortune cookie?

29:48.553 --> 29:49.110
Chinese!

29:49.220 --> 29:51.415
The Korean is the most perfect creature...

29:51.523 --> 29:55.152
ever to sanctify the earth
with the imprint of his foot.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.509
Now we will breathe.

30:24.122 --> 30:25.521
Breathe out...

30:26.424 --> 30:27.550
slowly.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.127
Do not gulp.

30:32.664 --> 30:37.465
If you do not breathe correctly,
you do not move correctly.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.266
Pitiful.

30:43.775 --> 30:47.267
I can see the deadly hamburger
has done its evil work.

30:48.146 --> 30:51.138
We must sweat the poison from your body...

30:51.216 --> 30:53.741
and rebuild from the inside.

30:54.652 --> 30:58.088
Now, we will proceed to lesson number two.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.315
Follow, please.

31:03.394 --> 31:06.227
What are you waiting for? Applause?

31:09.734 --> 31:12.259
Midtown. 44th Street.

31:22.513 --> 31:24.071
You are afraid.

31:26.784 --> 31:29.048
Fear is nothing more than a feeling.

31:29.120 --> 31:33.250
You feel hot, you feel hungry,
you feel angry, you feel afraid.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.258
Fear can never kill you.

31:58.182 --> 32:01.276
Purge your mind of fear
and believe in yourself.

32:02.220 --> 32:05.246
Without that belief,
I can do nothing with you.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.225
Now we will do it again.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.356
But faster.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.367
<i>Grove High Altitude Reconnaissance Probe.</i>

32:21.472 --> 32:24.464
<i>Program originally projected. ; $758 million.</i>

32:24.809 --> 32:27.642
<i>Final assembly of prototype. ; $986 million.</i>

32:27.879 --> 32:30.109
<i>Estimated cost at time of commission. ;</i>

32:30.181 --> 32:32.308
<i>$1.22 billion.</i>

32:32.417 --> 32:34.749
<i>These figures are in 1983 dollars.</i>

32:35.286 --> 32:36.719
<i>The Prototype...</i>

32:39.857 --> 32:43.623
<i>Currently, our friend Grove</i>
<i>is playing the D.C. charity circuit.</i>

32:43.728 --> 32:45.127
<i>Big donor.</i>

32:45.229 --> 32:48.790
<i>He's also big with the Star Wars crowd.</i>
<i>And he ought to be.</i>

32:49.167 --> 32:51.328
<i>Half of them are on his payroll.</i>

32:51.569 --> 32:54.231
<i>He's good. Real good.</i>

32:55.473 --> 32:56.565
No more Boy Scouts.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.209
<i>Yes, George.</i>

33:03.448 --> 33:05.245
This is interesting.

33:06.651 --> 33:11.247
Someone's trying to enter a circuit
I had marked for special surveillance.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.316
I wonder who the intruder is.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.404
- What's the matter?
- I can't get what I'm looking for.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.569
I hate to hear you say that.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.340
Why should the HARP D.B.A. Cost-62
be restricted?

33:38.683 --> 33:41.174
Maybe you've got cold hands.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.284
Allow me.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.721
See?

33:54.232 --> 33:55.893
Do I sense frustration?

33:56.267 --> 33:58.701
I'll bet you've had
a lot of experience with that.

33:58.803 --> 34:02.739
If I continue to stroke these little keys here...

34:02.840 --> 34:04.705
You might stunt your growth.

34:04.809 --> 34:07.937
No, Lieutenant,
I'll seek satisfaction elsewhere.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.351
Come in.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.797
- Major Fleming.
- General, I have a problem.

34:32.904 --> 34:37.341
The computer is classifying cost overruns
within the HARP database.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.672
- You know what I think about computers.
- Sir, it's not a malfunction.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.440
Maybe it hasn't been entered yet.

34:42.547 --> 34:46.380
They're entered and available,
otherwise access would not be denied.

34:46.451 --> 34:50.512
General, I'm the senior W.C.A.,
I should have access to that information.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.815
There's no reason for it to be withheld.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.688
Right. We do have a problem.
Just let me have a full report.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.988
It'll be on your desk tonight, and, sir...

34:58.596 --> 35:02.225
I really would appreciate action
by the time I return from Fort Baxter.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.860
- Fort Baxter?
- The AR-60 test.

35:06.504 --> 35:08.631
Grove infantry assault rifle.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.273
Of course. The AR-60. You have a job to do.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.638
But, Rayner,
let me give you a word of advice.

35:14.745 --> 35:17.976
Never feel you have to overdo it.
You know what I mean?

35:18.316 --> 35:21.376
It makes no difference to me
that you're a woman.

35:22.887 --> 35:23.979
That's good news, sir.

35:25.056 --> 35:29.550
If it's any reassurance, it makes
no difference to me that you're a man.

35:54.385 --> 35:57.877
All right, what have you done with the food?

36:00.358 --> 36:01.916
A Korean fingerboard.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.288
What are you staring at?

36:05.363 --> 36:07.388
- You can't see.
- I can see.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.692
Then what're you wearing those for?

36:09.800 --> 36:12.735
I wear glasses so that I may see more.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.607
A Korean fingerboard.
Begin tapping your fingers.

36:17.942 --> 36:21.434
Slowly at first and then increasing the force.

36:21.646 --> 36:24.979
With time, your nails will become hard,
your fingers strong.

36:25.082 --> 36:28.984
They will be able to do more than
just carry food to your face.

36:29.086 --> 36:32.522
- They will become a trained weapon.
- Trained to kill?

36:32.623 --> 36:35.387
Not kill. A truck kill.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.653
Meat of cow, kill.

36:37.795 --> 36:39.820
American assassins kill...

36:40.531 --> 36:41.862
like butchers.

36:41.966 --> 36:45.094
Masters of Sinanju, since the dawn of time...

36:45.570 --> 36:47.902
have killed to promote harmony...

36:48.139 --> 36:51.370
and to bring about a more peaceful humor
to the entire community.

36:52.443 --> 36:55.742
We have done this throughout history.
For example...

36:56.514 --> 36:57.947
Genghis Khan...

36:58.983 --> 37:01.713
the Persian boy, Alexander...

37:02.720 --> 37:04.585
- Robin Hood.
- Robin Hood?

37:05.423 --> 37:08.620
A bandit. Louis Xlll. Napoleon.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.058
Come on, Napoleon died in his bed.

37:12.663 --> 37:13.789
Wrong.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.566
All of them perfect assassinations.

37:22.139 --> 37:24.869
You make it sound like a public service.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.071
Professional assassination...

37:28.179 --> 37:31.706
is the highest form of public service.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.814
So I will persevere.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.547
I have taken the Emperor Smith's gold.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.991
And a Korean's word is his bond.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.724
Place your hands behind your head.

37:50.134 --> 37:52.466
I did not say keep them there.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.572
Your reflexes are pitiful.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.707
The seasons move faster.

37:58.075 --> 38:02.603
No doubt, the result of all that filthy poison
you have been stuffing into your belly.

38:02.713 --> 38:05.580
Do you know why
Americans call it fast food?

38:06.117 --> 38:09.109
Because it speeds them
on the way to the grave.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.888
As I feared, you have no sense of humor.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.789
From now on, you will eat rice.

38:19.897 --> 38:22.889
Eat rice and play with my fingerboard.
Great!

38:23.634 --> 38:26.569
Keep it near you at all times.
Hang it on a wall.

38:26.671 --> 38:27.695
How?

38:35.713 --> 38:37.044
Find a nail.

38:44.955 --> 38:47.048
<i>- Good morning, Jim.</i>
<i>- Hi, Doc.</i>

38:47.158 --> 38:50.150
<i>- How're you feeling this morning?</i>
<i>- Hey, never better.</i>

38:50.261 --> 38:52.126
<i>Coach Jenkins came by last night.</i>

38:52.229 --> 38:54.857
<i>He told me</i>
<i>that they're saving my place on the team.</i>

38:54.965 --> 38:59.561
<i>When I'm out of here in a couple of weeks,</i>
<i>I'm going right back on that squad.</i>

38:59.670 --> 39:01.535
<i>What's the matter, Doc?</i>

39:04.275 --> 39:07.142
<i>I'm sorry, Jim. I've got to level with you.</i>

39:08.846 --> 39:10.939
<i>The leg has got to come off.</i>

39:14.652 --> 39:15.641
<i>No!</i>

39:16.854 --> 39:19.118
<i>I was gonna be an all-American.</i>

39:19.857 --> 39:21.188
<i>Well, now...</i>

39:21.559 --> 39:24.027
<i>you can be all-American for courage.</i>

39:25.563 --> 39:28.088
<i>Doctor, does Linda know?</i>

39:28.899 --> 39:31.993
<i>There's something else</i>
<i>I've got to tell you, Jim.</i>

39:34.238 --> 39:34.966
What are you watching?

39:35.039 --> 39:38.634
Your country's
one and only contribution to the art.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.237
It concern family...

39:41.812 --> 39:43.973
Iove, honor, and courage.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.608
All that is noblest in the human spirit.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.642
It's a soap opera, for Christ's sakes.

39:49.754 --> 39:50.982
You'll spoil it.

39:51.055 --> 39:54.821
It's pre-spoiled.
Look, it's 8:00 and I haven't eaten all day.

39:54.892 --> 39:59.090
One minute to 8:00.
The trained mind does not need a watch.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.897
Watches are a confidence trick
invented by the Swiss.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.902
You would be better employed
developing your pitiful skills...

40:07.071 --> 40:08.800
than whining about your belly.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.069
Remember, perfection is a road...

40:12.877 --> 40:15.573
- not a destination.
- I love it when you talk like that.

40:16.180 --> 40:19.172
And I would love it if you would
kindly concentrate on your practice.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.775
Keep the weight off your toes.

41:54.078 --> 41:57.104
Every man is occasionally blessed with luck.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.176
Now, down.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.379
My pleasure. Down is easy.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.381
What happened?

42:10.294 --> 42:13.786
You rely on what you know,
not what you see.

42:21.305 --> 42:22.795
What is your problem?

42:28.312 --> 42:30.246
Pathetic.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.759
Come on, it's only water. It won't bite you.

42:51.835 --> 42:52.802
Move it.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.136
I said, move it.

43:12.489 --> 43:15.424
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, sure.

43:18.362 --> 43:22.059
That's it, Damico, hide behind a leaf.
No one will find you there.

43:39.083 --> 43:42.143
Don't just stand there!
Get down there and help Johnson!

43:43.854 --> 43:46.823
Radio the base and get an ambulance
out here, on the double.

43:46.924 --> 43:47.856
Yes, sir.

43:48.926 --> 43:53.056
Hoffa, what the hell are you doing?
Break out your first-aid kit. Now.

43:54.198 --> 43:56.063
About this new weapon, sir.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.799
I want to tell you something.

43:58.969 --> 44:02.370
- It's useless, sir!
- You're way out of line, soldier!

44:02.473 --> 44:04.100
- Sergeant!
- Sir!

44:04.208 --> 44:06.335
Assemble the company.
I want a weapons check.

44:06.443 --> 44:07.375
Yes, sir.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.505
Sergeant, I want your report
on my desk by 16:00!

44:12.116 --> 44:15.085
Sir, we've got over 120 AR-60s
in this company!

44:15.152 --> 44:18.053
You heard what I said. Get to it.

44:27.431 --> 44:28.295
Yes.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.897
General Watson.

44:35.172 --> 44:36.799
Good morning, General.

44:36.874 --> 44:38.535
We've got a problem, George.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.537
I'm sure you can handle it, General.

44:41.945 --> 44:44.175
A soldier's been killed by your new AR-60.

44:44.982 --> 44:46.847
That's what they get paid for.

44:48.018 --> 44:51.818
It blew up in his face.
I've got the report right here on my desk.

44:51.889 --> 44:53.880
<i>There'll have to be an inquiry.</i>

44:54.525 --> 44:55.549
Scott.

44:56.226 --> 44:59.423
Scott, I suggest you lose that report.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.327
I can't do that.

45:01.465 --> 45:02.830
Listen to me, Watson.

45:02.900 --> 45:06.961
Uncle Sam gave you your uniform.
Just about everything else you got from me.

45:07.171 --> 45:08.798
<i>Bury that report.</i>

45:11.508 --> 45:12.998
Thank you, General.

45:14.178 --> 45:16.908
<i>There's too many idiots</i>
<i>like him on the payroll.</i>

45:20.551 --> 45:22.212
Breathe.

45:23.454 --> 45:25.251
Use the air.

45:27.324 --> 45:28.985
Do not waste it.

45:30.594 --> 45:33.529
- Relax.
- Relax.

45:53.117 --> 45:55.517
Will you hang there all day...

45:55.619 --> 45:59.146
or may we continue the exercise, please?

46:10.701 --> 46:15.104
- Jesus.
- Concentrate! This is no time for prayer!

46:40.664 --> 46:42.325
You are not here to sightsee.

47:39.590 --> 47:43.993
That's it, kids. Lady Luck is watching you.
She's got her eyes on you.

47:44.061 --> 47:48.521
She hasn't got all day. She's waiting
for a crap game in Bensonhurst.

47:48.632 --> 47:50.099
Here we are, folks.

47:50.367 --> 47:54.497
Seven hoops a dollar.
Everyone a winner. Sir!

47:54.705 --> 47:57.435
You want to make
your grandchildren happy?

47:57.541 --> 48:00.339
Drop a hoop on a bottle, win a prize...

48:00.444 --> 48:03.641
and you're gonna see
their little faces light up.

48:04.181 --> 48:06.445
And your money back, Gramps.

48:06.550 --> 48:10.145
If you can tell me where you can buy
one of these genuine...

48:10.220 --> 48:13.781
handmade Taiwanese beauties.

48:32.242 --> 48:35.678
Just remember, I won it. He's mine.

48:39.349 --> 48:42.375
<i>So, if you will excuse me,</i>
<i>young Dr. Hastings...</i>

48:42.452 --> 48:44.818
<i>I must get up to the theater and scrub up.</i>

48:45.255 --> 48:48.520
<i>It's a dangerous operation.</i>
<i>It's never been tried before.</i>

48:48.625 --> 48:52.322
<i>I promised that boy he's going to walk,</i>
<i>and he's going to walk!</i>

48:52.429 --> 48:56.229
<i>Don't do it. If you fail,</i>
<i>it could mean a malpractice suit.</i>

48:56.500 --> 48:58.559
<i>Think of your professional reputation.</i>

48:58.669 --> 49:02.469
<i>That boy means more to me than</i>
<i>all of my professional awards combined.</i>

49:02.739 --> 49:05.708
<i>- There's only one thing that worries me.</i>
<i>- What's that?</i>

49:06.476 --> 49:09.274
<i>Whether his stepmother</i>
<i>will permit the operation.</i>

49:09.613 --> 49:10.705
<i>You see...</i>

49:11.381 --> 49:14.214
<i>she's my ex-wife.</i>

49:18.155 --> 49:19.247
<i>Where's Jim?</i>

49:19.656 --> 49:22.250
<i>- You shouldn't be here.</i>
<i>- I said where's Jim?</i>

49:22.459 --> 49:24.518
<i>Miss, I'm sorry. You'll have to leave.</i>

49:24.628 --> 49:27.426
<i>Nobody is going to stop me</i>
<i>from seeing my fiancиж.</i>

49:27.631 --> 49:30.259
<i>- What did you say?</i>
<i>- Jim and I are engaged.</i>

49:35.839 --> 49:38.364
<i>Tune in at the same time tomorrow...</i>

49:38.475 --> 49:42.309
<i>for our continuing saga</i>
<i>of</i> Beyond the Night.

49:42.813 --> 49:47.182
<i>Brought to you by Continental Airlines,</i>
<i>a new tradition in flying.</i>

49:51.888 --> 49:54.186
Jim is leaving the hospital.

49:54.791 --> 49:55.723
Great.

49:55.826 --> 49:59.387
- He's going to his mother's funeral.
- That's tough.

49:59.663 --> 50:03.258
- But I think the nurse likes him.
- That's good.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.799
However, there seems to be
some complication with the stepmother.

50:06.870 --> 50:11.239
It would be better for you
to eat this can than what is inside of it.

50:11.708 --> 50:15.769
Why must everything in this country
be covered with...

50:16.279 --> 50:18.804
"Monosodium glutamate."
You can't even say it.

50:18.915 --> 50:22.407
I can say "rat droppings."
It does not mean I want to eat them.

50:22.519 --> 50:27.479
Tomorrow, if you work well, you may have
a teaspoon full of honey in your rice.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.318
But I make no promises.

50:35.866 --> 50:39.632
You heard the sound of my flexor tendons
as I squeezed the trigger.

50:39.703 --> 50:42.604
And I saw the flutter of your metacarpals.
Not bad.

50:43.240 --> 50:45.800
That's two bullets. Child's play.

50:46.309 --> 50:50.370
When you can avoid six bullets,
then you will have accomplished something.

50:51.748 --> 50:53.215
No rice.

50:53.917 --> 50:55.407
No rice?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.513
You forgot the rice.

50:58.922 --> 50:59.820
Maybe we can grow some.

51:00.690 --> 51:04.490
Maybe you will spare me
your feeble attempts at humor...

51:04.728 --> 51:07.663
and save them for the shopkeeper
at the corner.

51:07.831 --> 51:09.628
He has excellent Chung-ju rice.

51:16.406 --> 51:18.636
You used the other four yesterday.

51:21.678 --> 51:22.838
I reloaded.

51:27.851 --> 51:29.409
<i>With all due respect to the Major...</i>

51:29.519 --> 51:34.479
<i>at this point in time, Ms. Fleming,</i>
<i>cost overruns are immaterial.</i>

51:34.825 --> 51:37.953
<i>The Air Force cannot evaluate</i>
<i>HARP until HARP flies.</i>

51:38.962 --> 51:40.429
<i>Exactly my point. Mr. Chairman...</i>

51:41.598 --> 51:44.431
if I may be permitted
to ask Mr. Grove a question.

51:45.569 --> 51:48.766
When can we expect to see the HARP?

51:49.606 --> 51:52.473
I can't believe what I'm hearing here today.

51:52.776 --> 51:56.337
I've devoted my life
to developing better ways...

51:56.446 --> 51:58.380
to defend this great country of ours.

51:58.448 --> 52:01.417
I never raised the subject
of your patriotism, Mr. Grove.

52:01.485 --> 52:03.453
I should damn well hope not.

52:03.887 --> 52:05.650
<i>If we could get back to the question at hand.</i>

52:05.755 --> 52:08.588
What about the CD-18, Major?

52:08.692 --> 52:11.024
Three months ahead of schedule
and under budget.

52:11.595 --> 52:12.653
Ready for testing next week.

52:12.762 --> 52:16.027
Mount Promise. I know.
General Watson and I will be there.

52:16.466 --> 52:18.764
<i>I'm impressed. This girl's got a lot of guts.</i>

52:18.869 --> 52:20.928
<i>- Who?</i>
- Major Fleming.

52:23.006 --> 52:25.440
She's the one
who tried to tap into the Grove circuit.

52:25.775 --> 52:28.835
If she's not careful,
she'll wind up with her ass in a sling.

52:32.682 --> 52:36.413
She's coming in to New York.
Maybe you'd better slow her down a bit.

52:37.521 --> 52:41.890
<i>Every time she mentions HARP,</i>
<i>our man Grove begins to get an itch.</i>

52:43.026 --> 52:44.721
<i>I wonder why?</i>

52:46.096 --> 52:49.429
I want that bitch put on a very short leash.

52:49.900 --> 52:52.425
Should be right up your alley, Stone.

53:44.087 --> 53:45.577
Pick up your feet.

53:52.128 --> 53:54.119
Float.

54:01.705 --> 54:02.797
Float.

54:28.698 --> 54:30.529
Congratulations, Chiun.

54:40.710 --> 54:43.440
Bearing in mind
that nature snubbed him cruelly...

54:43.546 --> 54:45.912
by denying him Korean birth...

54:46.016 --> 54:48.450
I am not entirely dissatisfied.

54:48.551 --> 54:51.452
- When will he be ready?
- Ahead of time, I think.

54:51.521 --> 54:52.647
Excellent.

54:53.223 --> 54:54.554
That means?

54:54.624 --> 54:57.024
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years?

54:57.694 --> 55:00.686
If I cut a few corners, 14 and a half.

55:02.098 --> 55:04.566
Chiun, I need to borrow him for a while.

55:07.203 --> 55:10.969
<i>- Emily, Jim's your son.</i>
<i>- I'm only his stepmother.</i>

55:11.074 --> 55:13.736
<i>But Margaret told me something</i>
<i>just before she died.</i>

55:13.810 --> 55:14.902
<i>What's that?</i>

55:15.078 --> 55:16.841
<i>Jim's your son, too.</i>

55:25.722 --> 55:26.916
Is it painful?

55:27.991 --> 55:30.551
I was singing an old Korean love song.

55:30.794 --> 55:33.160
The race must be practically extinct.

55:36.099 --> 55:38.659
Chiun, do you mind if I ask you something?

55:39.636 --> 55:41.968
- Two more minutes.
- No, I mean...

55:42.672 --> 55:45.539
how old are you? You are old, aren't you?

55:46.209 --> 55:47.733
For an apricot, yes.

55:48.812 --> 55:50.541
For a head of lettuce, even more so.

55:50.647 --> 55:54.674
But for a mountain,
I am not even begun in years.

55:55.885 --> 55:57.648
For a man, I am just right.

55:58.121 --> 55:59.850
Now I know, don't I?

56:07.263 --> 56:08.958
You ever been married?

56:12.001 --> 56:14.663
I am the Master of Sinanju.

56:19.242 --> 56:21.836
No women. Vows of celibacy. Eunuch.
That sort of stuff?

56:22.779 --> 56:25.748
You are trying to say something?

56:26.850 --> 56:27.782
No, just...

56:30.253 --> 56:33.017
What I'm saying is I've been cooped up
in this rat hole for a whole month...

56:33.123 --> 56:34.613
- working my...
- Sex.

56:34.724 --> 56:38.626
Yeah, sex! Now you're cooking.
Maybe it's the breathing and the rice...

56:38.728 --> 56:40.696
Lesson 36.

56:42.999 --> 56:47.265
The 20 steps designed
to bring a woman to sexual ecstasy.

56:49.038 --> 56:53.168
Though I personally have rarely found
it necessary to go beyond seven...

56:53.743 --> 56:55.005
to achieve bliss.

56:55.879 --> 56:57.073
Go on, I'm listening.

57:00.683 --> 57:04.642
With the left hand,
you locate the woman's pulse.

57:05.288 --> 57:07.813
Then, with the middle finger...

57:08.958 --> 57:12.587
and tapping in time with the pulse...

57:15.265 --> 57:16.562
Then what?

57:16.633 --> 57:20.330
Then you may put the rice in the bowl
and we may eat.

57:28.311 --> 57:30.677
What was the number
of the lesson this morning?

57:31.214 --> 57:32.875
Wasn't 36, I know that.

57:33.082 --> 57:37.018
You would call it "four."
I would call it "embarrassing."

57:46.129 --> 57:49.121
You know, Chiun,
there are times when I really like you.

57:49.232 --> 57:51.632
Of course. I am Chiun.

57:52.135 --> 57:56.367
- Then there are times when I could kill you.
- Good!

57:56.739 --> 57:59.139
We will practice that after dinner!

58:34.344 --> 58:35.675
Major Fleming?

58:38.348 --> 58:40.748
Colonel Gayber is expecting you.

58:41.784 --> 58:43.274
Major Fleming, sir.

58:48.258 --> 58:51.921
Hello, Major.
I have the documents you requested.

59:08.912 --> 59:10.402
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:15.218 --> 59:17.015
That's a nice uniform.

59:22.091 --> 59:23.251
Great buttons.

59:24.894 --> 59:25.861
Buttons?
