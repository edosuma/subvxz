<i>NARRATOR".
When we last saw the Dynamic Duo...</i>

00:11.930 --> 00:15.558
<i>...The Puzzler had lashed them
in the basket of an aerial balloon...</i>

00:15.767 --> 00:19.979
<i>...which would automatically be released
and plunge them to their doom...</i>

00:20.188 --> 00:22.440
<i>...when they reached 20,000 feet.</i>

00:22.649 --> 00:24.192
<i>How high are they now?</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:26.569
<i>In a moment, we shall see.</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:43.313
Gosh, Batman,
the altimeter reading is 19,000 feet.

01:43.646 --> 01:46.774
Oh. Another thousand
and the releasing mechanism...

01:46.983 --> 01:49.485
...will drop us like two eggs
from a heavenly hen.

01:49.694 --> 01:52.155
Yes, it looks hopeless, Robin.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.116
- Unless...
-Unless?

01:55.325 --> 01:57.368
Unless
that discarded piece of chewing gum...

01:57.577 --> 02:01.539
...that Puzzler's henchman threw in here...
-Chewing gum?

02:02.707 --> 02:06.252
Altimeters work like barometers, Robin...

02:06.461 --> 02:08.838
...but with the principle of air pressure.

02:09.047 --> 02:14.135
If you could place the chewing gum
over the air hole...

02:14.344 --> 02:18.973
I see. The pressure will stop
and the reading will stay under 20,000.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.184
- Correct.
<i>- I'll</i> try to get it.

02:21.392 --> 02:23.019
Try, Robin.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.485
- Try, Robin.
-I think I've got it.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.820
I've got it.

02:33.363 --> 02:35.406
Hurry, Robin, we haven't much time.

02:35.615 --> 02:36.991
Right.

02:37.992 --> 02:41.287
Be sure to cover it completely.

02:42.664 --> 02:43.706
Ah.

02:46.876 --> 02:50.838
Just under 20,000.

02:51.047 --> 02:53.966
That was a close call, Robin.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.386
This will teach that crook to be a litterbug.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.013
He should put trash
in a proper waste container.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.473
Yes.

03:00.682 --> 03:04.769
But, gosh, now how do we get down?

03:07.355 --> 03:11.025
Holy stratosphere, if we were only birds.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.902
- That's it, Robin.
-What?

03:13.111 --> 03:14.696
We do have a chance.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.240
It seems to me that I read in the paper...

03:17.448 --> 03:21.119
...that the elusive and high-flying,
giant, red-eyed hermit nuthatch birds...

03:21.327 --> 03:24.163
...are migrating south for the winter.

03:24.706 --> 03:26.833
Batman, look.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.459
Coming this way.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.715
Robin, those bird calls
that you were practicing this morning...

03:33.923 --> 03:39.470
...do you have an elusive, high-flying,
giant, red-eyed hermit nuthatch bird...

03:39.679 --> 03:40.888
...in your repertoire?

03:41.431 --> 03:45.101
Holy Audubon, Batman,
I didn't get to that species yet.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.520
Couldn't you improvise?

03:47.729 --> 03:52.483
That bird, by nature, is a very hostile bird.

03:52.692 --> 03:55.653
If you can infuriate him,
perhaps he'll attack the balloon.

03:55.862 --> 03:59.657
I get it. One or two holes in the balloon
and we float smoothly down to earth.

03:59.866 --> 04:01.576
I'll sure try.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.716
Good boy, Robin, it's working.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.097
He did it, Batman.

04:23.765 --> 04:25.141
Yes, he did it.

04:27.643 --> 04:30.146
He's flying off now.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.024
He's had enough hot air.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.068
Farewell, feathered friend.

04:36.277 --> 04:40.114
Sorry to have disrupted your vacation.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.371
We're dropping a lot faster
than we went up.

04:47.789 --> 04:50.625
The power of gravity, Robin.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.212
Not even Puzzler could prevent that.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.062
Holy crack-up.

05:14.524 --> 05:19.445
I think we can expect
a reasonably soft landing.

05:35.628 --> 05:37.421
Talk about soft landings.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.173
Yes, it was a good one.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.092
Any idea where we are?

05:41.300 --> 05:45.096
Judging from the terrain
and the direction the wind carried us...

05:45.304 --> 05:47.306
...I'd say upstate of Gotham City.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.684
I'd say upstate from nowhere.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.562
No, our luck seems to be holding out,
old chum.

05:52.770 --> 05:56.148
Look, as if we ordered it specially.

05:57.650 --> 06:00.152
We can thank the taxpayer
and Governor Stonefellow...

06:00.319 --> 06:03.364
...for this emergency public telephone.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.284
Now to get out of these bonds.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.787
Yes, these jewels are lovely...

06:09.996 --> 06:13.666
...but they're not a drop in the bucket
compared with what we are really after.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.837
The Retsoor is worth a king's ransom.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.172
Now, Rocket,
you know what you have to do.

06:20.381 --> 06:25.094
But this time,
please, please be expressive.

06:25.261 --> 06:31.100
Ooh. What girl wouldn't be
with a bultimillionaire like Artemus Knab...

06:31.309 --> 06:36.522
...who controls just about everything
and might make her a movie star?

06:36.689 --> 06:39.567
Might make me a movie star.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.777
Nothing can stop us now, Puzzler.

06:41.944 --> 06:45.448
Oh, nothing.
Not even the late Dynamic Duo.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.908
By my calculation...

06:47.116 --> 06:51.287
...they should have dropped 20,000 feet
from the balloon by now.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.582
Not yet, Puzzler.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.752
But you're-- You're dead.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.713
How puzzling.
What on earth could have happened?

07:00.922 --> 07:04.425
We'll explain that later, Puzzler,
but right now...

07:04.634 --> 07:07.303
Escape plan number three.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.514
Let the heavens open.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.525
Oh, imagine me...

07:21.734 --> 07:27.448
...little old Rocket O'Rourke having tea
with a great big tycoon like you...

07:27.657 --> 07:30.618
...Arty, baby. Oh, let me pour.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.497
I have oodles of talent for pouring tea too.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.668
Yes. Well, I would say that you're
a very well-rounded young lady, heh...

07:38.876 --> 07:41.504
...with, uh, considerable
well-rounded talent.

07:41.712 --> 07:44.090
- Oh, flatterer.
-Ha-ha-ha-ha.

07:44.382 --> 07:46.509
Well, cheers.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.636
Oh, yeah. This is a very delicate tea.

07:48.803 --> 07:51.847
It's from my own blend of oolong.

07:53.933 --> 07:57.311
You see, I have a tea monopoly.
Play. Monopol--

07:57.520 --> 07:59.939
Monopoly...

08:03.526 --> 08:04.902
Phew.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.119
Bravo, Rocket, bravo.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.870
Well, it worked, Puzzler.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.999
But I almost wish it hadn't.
He promised me a screen test.

08:18.165 --> 08:22.128
Oh, these juggling fiends
that keep the word of promise to our ear...

08:22.336 --> 08:25.840
...and break it to our hope.
Uh, Macbeth.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.384
I did my job, Puzzler. Now you do yours.

08:28.592 --> 08:33.347
A-okay, Rocket. Onto the deed.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.059
Do you know the combination?

08:38.269 --> 08:42.648
I haven't been watching every move
of Artemus Knab's for the past two weeks...

08:42.857 --> 08:44.358
...for nothing.

08:45.026 --> 08:50.114
Yes, by the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.

08:50.322 --> 08:53.534
Open locks, whoever knocks!

08:53.743 --> 08:55.119
VoilÃ .

08:55.327 --> 08:57.121
The camera.

08:57.455 --> 09:02.626
Ah. Excellent. Excellent.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.421
Well, what I don't understand, Puzzler...

09:05.629 --> 09:09.884
...is if you've already taken pictures
of the cockpit, why do you need more?

09:10.092 --> 09:16.766
Those pictures of the plane's control panels,
plus these pictures of the plane's plans...

09:16.974 --> 09:20.728
...will teach me everything I need to know
about flying the Retsoor.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.104
Yeah.

09:22.313 --> 09:25.691
But I don't think it will help
my acting career any when he finds out.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.151
The envelope.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.529
Don't you think you've left enough clues
for today, Puzzler?

09:30.738 --> 09:35.534
A crime is nothing without a modus operandi,
Rocket.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.704
- The envelope.
-Tsk.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.711
This, plus another little scheme
I have in the works...

09:45.920 --> 09:50.132
...should certainly make the Dynamic Duo
put on their thinking caps.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.136
Careful.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.850
I don't hear any ticking.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.352
But it could be dangerous.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.603
Stand back, everybody.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.735
Mother Machree, a rooster!

10:09.944 --> 10:13.948
Well, I've had some strange birds in my office
in my time, but this is going too far.

10:14.156 --> 10:20.037
"Batman, how canst thou keep a rooster
from crowing on a Sabbath morn?"

10:20.246 --> 10:23.457
- By killing him on a Saturday night.
-Tonight is Saturday night.

10:23.666 --> 10:29.463
Yes. And I tremble to think of what might occur
if we don't piece this cunning puzzle together.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.174
Commissioner,
have you spoken with Artemus Knab?

10:32.383 --> 10:33.843
I haven't been able to reach him.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.638
But the desk clerk at the Gotham Arms
tells me he hasn't left his penthouse.

10:37.847 --> 10:40.141
We were thinking
of sending a man over to check.

10:40.349 --> 10:45.312
Wait. There's a specific reason why Puzzler
wanted to be in business with Knab.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.690
Perhaps Knab can provide us with a clue.

10:47.898 --> 10:51.277
I suspect this calls
for one of our unnoticed arrivals.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.488
- Ready for another Bat-climb, Robin?
-You bet, Batman.

11:04.415 --> 11:05.541
What's wrong, Robin?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.251
Tired? Dizzy?

11:07.459 --> 11:09.587
I had a strange feeling, Batman.

11:09.795 --> 11:15.176
As if-- As if visions of sugarplums
were dancing in my head.

11:17.094 --> 11:22.349
They should be, Boy Wonder,
it's almost Christmas. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.311
Welcome to Gotham City, Mr. Claus.

11:25.519 --> 11:30.316
Why, call me Santa Claus, Batman.
Everybody else does.

11:30.524 --> 11:36.405
Say, you tell me where the Batcave is
and I'll leave a little present in your stocking.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.700
If you can't trust Santa,
whom can you trust?

11:41.076 --> 11:42.912
We can't tell you here, Mr. Claus...

11:43.120 --> 11:46.040
...but we'll telephone you at the North Pole
on the Batphone.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.833
Good, good.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.252
I'll get to the Batcave...

11:50.461 --> 11:54.590
...if I have to slide down a Batpole
instead of a chimney.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.801
Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.262
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
-Merry Christmas, Santa.

12:00.429 --> 12:01.472
Ho-ho-ho.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.724
And say hello to those eight reindeer for us.

12:03.933 --> 12:06.644
I Will, I Will.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.314
Merry Christmas.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.151
Merry Christmas, everybody.

12:27.206 --> 12:29.917
Another unannounced intrusion, Batman?

12:31.293 --> 12:35.297
We didn't want to attract undue attention,
Mr. Knab.

12:35.506 --> 12:39.677
We did suspect
that you might be in trouble.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.554
Trouble? You mean out cold.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.934
Some aspiring actress apparently decided
that the best way to further her career...

12:47.142 --> 12:50.312
...was to slip a mickey in my oolong.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.523
Strange thinking.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.358
Do you have any reason
to believe that she might...

12:55.734 --> 12:56.777
...be associated with Puzzler?

12:57.111 --> 12:59.655
From what I hear of his antics
after I launched the Retsoor...

12:59.822 --> 13:02.241
...I wouldn't put anything past Puzzler.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.828
Including that note addressed to me
and pinned to your lapel?

13:05.995 --> 13:07.204
What?

13:07.371 --> 13:09.873
Why, the scoundrel!

13:10.541 --> 13:11.917
I tried to warn you, Mr. Knab.

13:12.126 --> 13:15.254
You did indeed, young man,
and I was foolish not to listen.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.843
Holy ghost writer. There's nothing on it.

13:22.511 --> 13:27.308
Why would he use a pretty girl to drug me
to leave a blank piece of paper for you?

13:27.516 --> 13:30.311
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Artemus...

13:30.519 --> 13:33.689
...that are dreamt of in your philosophy.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.940
That's a quote from--

13:35.149 --> 13:36.567
I know. Hamlet.

13:36.942 --> 13:40.863
Yes. Well, I can do without any further lines
from Shakespeare, Batman.

13:41.071 --> 13:45.242
Understandable.
Now, this apparently blank piece of paper--

13:46.660 --> 13:51.290
--Seems to have a slight odor
of secret writing on it.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.501
Of course.
I've heard it's one of Puzzler's favorite tricks.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.420
What else have you heard, Boy Wonder?

13:56.587 --> 13:59.131
Any reason why he would be trying
to fleece me?

13:59.506 --> 14:05.512
We don't have the answer to that now,
Mr. Knab, but we hope to know shortly.

14:05.721 --> 14:10.225
If you'll excuse us. We'll take this piece
of paper back to the Batcave and analyze it.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.645
<i>- I'll</i> come with you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Knab.

14:13.854 --> 14:18.817
The location of the Batcave
must remain Robin's and my secret alone.

14:19.485 --> 14:20.527
Godspeed.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.911
Look, the invisible ink is appearing.

14:29.119 --> 14:33.248
-"P-U-Z-Z-L-E-S."
-Puzzles?

14:33.457 --> 14:35.334
Strange. Nothing more.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.002
What could it mean?

14:37.211 --> 14:40.089
"Puzzles" has seven letters.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.299
What comes in sevens, Robin?

14:42.508 --> 14:45.761
- Seven-league boots...
-Mm.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.138
-...seven seas...
-Hm.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.349
...the dance of the seven veils.

14:50.557 --> 14:55.562
It must be something connected
with his trying to tell us something.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.065
The telephone.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.485
The telephone.

15:01.693 --> 15:07.032
The average modern telephone number
consists of seven digits.

15:07.199 --> 15:13.122
Oh. Then matching the digits
to the letters, P-U-Z-Z-L-E-S...

15:13.288 --> 15:17.042
...would be seven, eight...

15:17.251 --> 15:19.420
It doesn't work.
There isn't any Z on the dial.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.380
Obviously. That's the puzzle.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.675
Z is the most enigmatic letter in the alphabet,
old chum.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.677
Think of the words that begin with Z.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.430
Zigzag, zither, zodiac.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.141
- Zounds.
-Exactly.

15:32.349 --> 15:37.312
Zounds is a Shakespearean interjection
of wonder or surprise.

15:37.521 --> 15:43.485
Apparently, Puzzler expects this puzzle
to catch us unprepared.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.571
Oh, Which it has.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.489
No, Robin.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.783
Not entirely.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.785
There is a Shakespearean quotation...

15:51.994 --> 15:56.123
...I suspect must be uppermost
in Puzzler's mind at this time...

15:56.331 --> 15:59.460
...and which I find quite appropriate.

15:59.668 --> 16:06.675
There is a divinity in odd numbers,
either in nativity, chance, or death.

16:06.884 --> 16:13.682
<i>The Merry Wives of Windsor
Act 3,</i> Scene 4, <i>Line 22.</i>

16:14.016 --> 16:17.019
Why are odd numbers so appropriate?

16:18.103 --> 16:22.941
Some combination of them in the phone dial
must be his number.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.861
But we know his hideout
is in that Globe Balloon Factory.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.614
No, I doubt if we could reach him there again,
so...

16:28.822 --> 16:31.450
Divinity in odd numbers.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.161
If you can work this, Batman,
there must be.

16:37.456 --> 16:41.210
Whew...
What a groovy jumpsuit, Puzzler.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.046
One must keep up
with the Space Age, Rocket.

16:44.254 --> 16:47.341
This is the perfect garb
for flying the Retsoor.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.886
Now, hurry, boys,
the clock abrades me with the waste of time.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.641
Speak, knave.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.143
Puzzler, this is Batman.

16:58.352 --> 17:01.188
As I suspected, Caped Crusader.

17:01.396 --> 17:04.733
I'd like to exchange quotations with you,
but time is money.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.402
So I'll just leave you with this thought:

17:07.611 --> 17:14.617
An aviator was carrying his clothes home
from the cleaners when it began to rain.

17:14.910 --> 17:18.121
How didst he protect them?

17:21.083 --> 17:24.336
Holy miracles, Batman.
You got his number on your first try.

17:24.545 --> 17:28.757
Now, an aviator was carrying his clothes home
from the cleaners...

17:28.924 --> 17:33.929
...when it began to rain.
Gosh, that's a tough one.

17:34.137 --> 17:37.724
Yes. First, a puzzle dealing with roosters
and now this.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.727
Looks like we're flying blind, Batman.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.147
Flying. Flying?

17:44.898 --> 17:49.778
Don't you know how the aviator
protected the clothes he was carrying?

17:49.987 --> 17:52.864
He put them inside the hangars.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.908
Hangar. That can only mean--

17:55.117 --> 17:57.202
Artemus Knab's airplane, Retsoor.

17:57.411 --> 17:58.996
Rooster spelled backwards.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.915
And this scheme
could've been under our noses all the time.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.667
To the Batmobile.

18:04.668 --> 18:07.379
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, back in the abandoned shed...</i>

18:07.588 --> 18:11.717
<i>...the Puzzler
has set up a magic lantern show.</i>

18:12.926 --> 18:18.015
Considering the haste
with which I made these microfilm photos...

18:18.181 --> 18:23.228
...of Artemus Knab's secret plans,
I'd say the photography is not too bad.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.605
You're a genius, chief.

18:24.813 --> 18:28.442
Oh, no time for accolades, Ramjet.

18:28.984 --> 18:35.699
Now that I've solved all of Retsoor's secrets,
flying her should be a soft and gentle breeze.

18:35.907 --> 18:39.286
The plane's fueled up and ready to go,
but they left two guards in front.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.414
Fret not, Blimpy,
they don't even know we've found this shed...

18:42.623 --> 18:44.833
...or that it connects with the hangar.

18:45.042 --> 18:49.421
Rocket, go outside
and create your usual diversion.

18:49.588 --> 18:52.424
Oh. Sure thing, Puzzler.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.885
Mm...

18:55.052 --> 18:59.598
Six million dollars' worth of machinery.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.768
And we make the killing tonight.

19:02.976 --> 19:07.064
How unbearably scrumptious.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.149
Gonna sell it to a foreign government?

19:09.358 --> 19:11.360
Have you taken leave of your senses,
Glider?

19:11.568 --> 19:13.403
I may be an archvillain...

19:13.612 --> 19:18.617
...but I'm a 100-percent
naturalized American archvillain.

19:18.825 --> 19:23.288
No one gets his hands on that plane
except Artemus Knab...

19:23.497 --> 19:26.792
...after he's, uh, paid me a small ransom...

19:27.000 --> 19:31.004
...of, say, um, $4 million.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.093
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

19:36.301 --> 19:40.597
My heart is always heavy
when a caper finally comes to an end...

19:40.806 --> 19:43.350
...but end it must.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.770
All right, men, to my work.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.314
Follow me.

19:57.531 --> 20:01.743
Her beauty makes this vault
a feasting presence full of light.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.413
- But where are we going?
-To some neutral country...

20:04.621 --> 20:07.666
...from which I can negotiate
with Artemus Knab.

20:07.833 --> 20:12.212
- Do we need passports and stuff?
-The Retsoor is all the passport we need.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.340
- Ah.
Heh-heh-heh.

20:15.507 --> 20:19.386
Boy, I should get
an Academy Award for that act.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.597
I just told the guards
that I ran out of gas down the road...

20:22.806 --> 20:25.058
...and I left two of my girlfriends in it.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.518
Then the guards are gone?

20:26.727 --> 20:28.270
Like the wind.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.983
I told them my girlfriends
were cold and lonely.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.693
Good thinking, Rocket.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.571
Blimpy, open the hangar door.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.741
Aboard, aboard.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.915
My puzzles have done
a lot of outpuzzling.

20:49.124 --> 20:53.795
But this is the first time I've outpuzzled
an airplane's control panel puzzle.

20:59.384 --> 21:02.387
Egad, what was that? Where's Blimpy?

21:08.977 --> 21:11.188
It is shut again.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.691
Hm?

21:16.359 --> 21:18.612
Yes, Puzzler, shut again.

21:18.820 --> 21:23.241
And will remain shut until you and your
high-flying flunkies are floored forever.

21:23.450 --> 21:28.163
Cleverer than I thought, Caped Crusaders,
but I still mean to launch the Retsoor.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.456
You mean hijack it.

21:29.664 --> 21:32.876
A mere matter of semantics, Boy Wonder.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.546
Lights, camera, action.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.026
Zounds.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.611
No, Puzzler.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.489
Leaving out the semantics,
you're about to be launched...

22:44.698 --> 22:45.740
...off to prison.

22:45.949 --> 22:48.743
I suspect the authorities
should be arriving shortly.

22:50.161 --> 22:54.082
Your suspicion is correct, Batman.
Good thing you called from the Batmobile.

22:54.291 --> 22:57.586
We'd have been here sooner,
but Grand Avenue is all torn up.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.046
May I present the infamous Puzzler,
gentlemen.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.883
He's in your charge now,
also this young lady.

23:03.216 --> 23:06.469
But all I ever wanted to be
was a movie star.

23:06.678 --> 23:10.432
Opportunities like that don't come often,
Miss O'Rourke, and must be earned.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.602
Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.

23:14.352 --> 23:17.188
Too many puzzles.
Is that what did it, Batman?

23:17.397 --> 23:21.067
One too many.
Quantity finally exceeded quality, Puzzler.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.820
And all those quotes of Shakespeare
didn't help either.

23:24.029 --> 23:27.407
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

23:27.616 --> 23:29.200
<i>- Hamlet.
-Act 4.</i>

23:29.409 --> 23:31.620
- Scene 1.
-Line 46.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.747
Forty-five.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.417
Egad, sir, you're right.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.761
Well...

23:48.345 --> 23:49.471
What's going on here?

23:49.679 --> 23:54.059
Bruce and Dick, aren't these
the cutest puzzle balloons you've ever seen?

23:54.267 --> 23:55.936
Yes, they're very unusual.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.563
Some balloon factory
was going out of business...

23:58.772 --> 24:02.025
...and Alfred was able
to get the exact ones I need...

24:02.233 --> 24:05.445
...for a party I'm giving
for underprivileged children.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.280
My pleasure, madam.

24:07.489 --> 24:10.367
They really are quite a novelty,
aren't they?

24:11.076 --> 24:14.412
Verily, Aunt Harriet, quite a novelty.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.624
- Well, all's well that--
-That ends well, sir?

24:17.832 --> 24:19.250
Well...
