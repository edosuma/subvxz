00:01.002 --> 00:02.935
      (flourishing music)

00:14.348 --> 00:19.418
       (insects chirping)
      (suspenseful music)

01:07.401 --> 01:08.667
          - How much?

01:08.669 --> 01:12.104
       - 3000 Baht, or 85
       American dollars..

01:12.106 --> 01:13.372
      That's a great deal.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.275
      A massage like that
       back in the states

01:16.277 --> 01:17.943
     would cost a lot more.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.253
           20 bucks.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.646
         (gentle music)

02:11.398 --> 02:14.199
        (frogs croaking)

02:15.836 --> 02:18.337
          (Thai music)

02:24.979 --> 02:26.678
 (speaking in foreign language)

02:26.680 --> 02:27.579
           - English?

02:29.750 --> 02:30.649
            - Hello.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.185
            - Hello.

02:35.055 --> 02:35.954
        Can I check in?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.595
      Can I check in now?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.164
    This is a hotel, right?

02:49.036 --> 02:50.736
        So, do you have
       a room available?

02:54.542 --> 02:55.974
 Is there a secret hand shake?

02:57.178 --> 02:58.944
      Okay, you gonna stop
        messing with me?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.412
      I'm exhausted, man.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.582
  If you have a room, I would
    like to pay for a room.

03:03.584 --> 03:07.386
    That's how hotels work.
        (chair scrapes)

03:07.388 --> 03:08.287
         - One moment.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.434
        - I am so sorry.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.103
    Our overnight desk clerk
     doesn't speak English

03:26.173 --> 03:27.673
     But let's start over.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.676
 My name is Gabriella and I am
  the owner of the Hotel Kok.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.910
      - Nice to meet you.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.645
        - The name under
       your reservation?

03:33.647 --> 03:37.683
   - Jack Shore, I'm the guy
    that needs a hotel room.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.051
 - We just need your passport,

03:39.053 --> 03:41.019
       and then could you
      fill out this form?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.759
   I didn't think any planes
 got in this late, long night?

03:49.163 --> 03:51.296
   - First night in Thailand,
   go big or go home, right?

03:53.033 --> 03:58.070
 - Room is 207, don't hesitate
  to ask if you need any help.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.073
   If it's your first time in
Thailand it's easy to get lost,

04:01.075 --> 04:03.575
   so I'm happy to point you
    in the right direction.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.678
       - Thank you, I'll
       keep that in mind.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.780
      - Your room is just
       up the stairwell,

04:08.782 --> 04:10.749
 down the hall and on the left.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.162
          (rock music)

05:19.953 --> 05:21.620
     - You've been working
        so much lately,

05:21.622 --> 05:23.221
let's get the hell out of here.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.025
        - You still want
       to go to Thailand?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.127
    - Why not, it's supposed
        to be beautiful.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.730
   - Who's gonna pay for it?

05:33.067 --> 05:35.400
           (knocking)

05:37.571 --> 05:39.538
       - From Gabriella.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.539
      - [Jack] Thank you.

05:42.309 --> 05:45.610
     (soft distorted music)

06:11.638 --> 06:12.537
              Hey.
             - Hi.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.278
     - What would you like?

06:21.315 --> 06:22.814
        - English, nice.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.916
      How about a coffee?

06:28.455 --> 06:31.857
    Oh hey, I don't suppose
  that you've seen this woman?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.292
    - Photo isn't very good.

06:34.294 --> 06:38.597
        But no, I don't
      think I've seen her.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.235
      Who you looking for?

06:44.538 --> 06:47.873
   - Just someone, thank you.

06:52.012 --> 06:52.878
            See ya.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.381
      - Oh, you know what,
  there's coffee and breakfast

06:56.383 --> 06:59.284
   at the hotel, if I failed
  to mention that last night,

06:59.286 --> 07:00.552
         I'm so sorry.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.154
       - Nah, no worries,
       it was, you know,

07:02.156 --> 07:03.955
        three a.m. when
       I checked in, so.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.123
        - Did you sleep?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.224
     - No, I didn't sleep.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.560
           - Jet lag?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.961
        - Yeah, jet lag.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.465
    Shouldn't you be at the
  hotel just in case any more

07:13.467 --> 07:17.002
  you know, non-Thai speaking
  idiots like me need a room?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.937
 - No, I write best at sunrise.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.473
   And the planes don't come
   in for a couple hours, so,

07:21.475 --> 07:25.377
     I am safe from English
       speaking tourists.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.812
    - What are you writing?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.580
 - Well, it's a novel of sorts.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.450
   - Really, what's it about?

07:31.452 --> 07:32.818
   - You really want to know?

07:34.188 --> 07:38.223
   It's about man's desperate
  attempt to find one's self.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.057
         - Is that all?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.225
      - That's not enough?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.031
       - Have a nice day.

07:48.402 --> 07:51.436
 - When you're not in a hurry,
   I'd love to tell you more.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.673
   - You know I'd like that,
   I'm a writer as well, so.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.576
       - Really, well you
     have a beautiful day.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.512
    - Shouldn't be too hard,
 huh, supposed to be paradise?

08:02.749 --> 08:03.782
      - Most of the time.

08:05.085 --> 08:10.155
        (birds chirping)
         (gentle music)

08:19.967 --> 08:21.633
       - [Jack] Where is
       Jess going again?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.768
- Uh, trade convention, Chicago.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.037
   - I thought she was tying
   to cut down on work trips.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.406
     - She is, they're just
    understaffed right now.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.176
 - Maybe they could hire Jack.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.077
         - Very funny.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.546
      - I wasn't laughing.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.216
     - I love that she's so
passionate about what she does,

08:38.217 --> 08:40.652
        but we just wish
      she was around more.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.822
I mean, we don't need the money.

08:43.823 --> 08:44.823
      - It's not about the
       money if she loves

08:44.825 --> 08:45.724
       what she's doing.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.996
   - What about you, you got
    anything on the horizon?

08:50.998 --> 08:53.198
        - No, can't get
      any of these agents

08:53.200 --> 08:54.900
      to bite on the specs
     I've been sending out.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.402
   - I don't know why anybody
  ever paid you, to be honest.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.170
      Do you know back in
     school I used to write

08:59.172 --> 09:01.006
  his English papers for him?

09:01.008 --> 09:03.508
       Never knowing he'd
   actually become a writer.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.146
         (glass thuds)

09:12.719 --> 09:14.586
    - [Jack] Brett, how are
rehearsals for the school play?

09:14.588 --> 09:18.456
 - Oh, um, great, just hope mom
  doesn't miss our big night.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.391
       - She'll be back.

09:24.464 --> 09:28.733
     - Go ahead, tell him.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.102
  - Elizabeth, come on, don't
   do this in front of Brett.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.003
         - Sorry Brett.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.876
       Tell Trevor where
        you want to go.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.414
       - Elizabeth isn't
     sold on the idea yet,

09:42.416 --> 09:43.915
 but I want to go to Thailand.

09:46.887 --> 09:51.957
            - What?
         (eerie music)

10:00.534 --> 10:02.767
      - Is this city hall?
             - Yup.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.805
     - Um, I'm looking for
       an American woman.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.076
     - American, there's a
     lot of American women

10:12.379 --> 10:14.012
      live in Chaing Rai.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.780
       - Right, this one
        never came home.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.083
     Can you check if there
       are any businesses

10:18.085 --> 10:19.284
    registered in her name?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.726
          (book thuds)

10:30.697 --> 10:31.596
            - There.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.332
   - Uh, I don't speak Thai.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.436
         - She English?
          - American.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.346
 - Look at this, American name.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.749
- Okay, so can you just tell me

10:50.751 --> 10:52.417
     where there's another
    place I where I can find

10:52.419 --> 10:53.985
any information on an American?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.991
 - Maybe ask another American?

11:03.296 --> 11:04.195
            - Nice.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.265
     Great city hall, bro.

11:12.406 --> 11:16.508
     - Hey, everything okay
    with you and Elizabeth?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.144
      - Yeah, we're good.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.416
  - All right, we are talking
  about Thailand later, okay?

11:24.418 --> 11:26.317
    - Goodnight Uncle Jack.
       - Goodnight Brett.

11:28.855 --> 11:29.854
         - I'll see you
       this weekend, bro.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.556
        - See you, Trev.
             - Bye.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.490
       - See you, Brett.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.594
        (wind whooshing)

11:39.332 --> 11:42.400
      (dishes clattering)

11:44.171 --> 11:47.105
      - You know, customs
      isn't gonna let you

11:47.107 --> 11:47.972
   bring drugs into Thailand.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.546
        - I had no idea,
      thank you for that.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.348
        (water sloshing)

12:00.253 --> 12:02.887
  - Can you even go two weeks?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.223
        - Elizabeth, I'm
     tired of apologizing.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.459
  - Yeah, well, I'm not tired
    of hearing it quite yet.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.262
        (dish shatters)

12:13.900 --> 12:16.701
        (Thai pop music)

12:19.106 --> 12:20.638
     - What can I get you?

12:20.640 --> 12:22.407
      - Entrepreneur, huh?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.477
  I like it, uh, beer, please.

12:25.479 --> 12:26.377
          - Thai Beer?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.646
   - Is there any other kind?

12:31.451 --> 12:32.517
          - You human.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.054
       - You too, buddy.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.424
    - You human. (laughing)

12:40.560 --> 12:42.694
 - What are you talking about?

12:42.696 --> 12:44.162
    - Only humans come here.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.198
       - I can see that.

12:47.200 --> 12:52.237
    He's human, he's human,
    he's human, he's human.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.439
           (laughing)
        We're all human.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.118
            - Nick.
            - Jack.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.755
    - [Nick] Jack, awesome.

13:10.757 --> 13:11.923
     - Why is that awesome?

13:14.628 --> 13:17.495
       - I dunno, I was.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.831
   Okay, are you backpacking
     through Thailand, or?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.767
  - No, I'm here for the study
  abroad program for assholes.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.104
           (laughing)

13:27.040 --> 13:28.306
    - That was really funny.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.675
       Let me guess, uh,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.779
 you're looking for some weed.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.919
  - What makes you think that?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.521
  - Well, I don't know, you're
   a GQ looking mother fucker

13:43.523 --> 13:45.890
    flashing beaucoup bucks
      in a Thai shithole.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.625
        I mean, doesn't
       take a scientist.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.361
        You're not here
       because you human.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.532
  - Have you seen this woman?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.869
       - This is the most
       beat up photograph

13:57.871 --> 13:59.170
   I've ever seen in my life.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.207
   - A simple no also works.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.244
  - You guys seen this woman?

14:07.013 --> 14:10.081
      (people chattering)

14:13.019 --> 14:15.220
   - Back to the weed, then.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.789
         (eerie music)

14:25.498 --> 14:27.298
        - [Joe] So, you
       going to Thailand?

14:28.501 --> 14:29.734
    - That's the plan, man.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.937
   - I heard it's beautiful.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.108
   - Yeah, I heard that too.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.247
          - Hey, Joe.
        - Hi Elizabeth.

14:44.985 --> 14:45.884
          - [Jack] Hi.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.354
         (exotic music)

15:21.955 --> 15:25.123
      (footsteps thumping)

15:26.293 --> 15:31.029
    ¶ Sweet baby blue, they
    all want to taste you ¶

15:31.031 --> 15:33.231
          - Hey babe.
      ¶ Sweet baby blue ¶

15:33.233 --> 15:36.000
       ¶ I want to, too ¶

15:36.002 --> 15:37.435
  ¶ I don't want you comin' ¶

15:37.437 --> 15:38.336
     ¶ Round here no more ¶
        - How was work?

15:40.307 --> 15:44.242
      ¶ Why don't you come
     'round here no more ¶

15:44.244 --> 15:45.410
   - [Jack] Don't look happy

15:47.948 --> 15:49.714
 Jesus Christ, this shit again?

15:49.716 --> 15:53.618
       ¶ Pick my bleeding
     heart off the floor ¶

15:53.620 --> 15:56.087
  - I got a confirmation email
    from the airline today.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.624
         How dare you!

15:59.626 --> 16:02.126
          (rock music)

16:08.802 --> 16:11.269
   Thailand was still an open
  discussion, and you know it.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.404
     - When was it gonna be
      a closed discussion?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.473
            Come on.
       - So tired of it.

16:16.576 --> 16:21.245
      ¶ Sweet baby blue I
     drink from your cup ¶

16:21.247 --> 16:22.647
      ¶ Sweet baby blue ¶

16:22.649 --> 16:24.315
           - Come on.
      - This isn't working

16:25.452 --> 16:26.985
      - [Jack] Elizabeth,
      where are you going?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.619
   - [Clare] If you want, we
   can go younger next time.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.422
     ¶ Is burning you up ¶

16:31.424 --> 16:32.991
    - But that's more money.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.025
 - [Jack] Don't be ridiculous.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.393
   - I'm tired of being used.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.761
            - Used?
          - Yes, used.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.296
       - Are you serious?
  - You haven't sold anything

16:38.298 --> 16:39.564
     in four fucking years.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.932
   - Yeah, and four years ago

16:40.934 --> 16:43.167
dating a Hollywood screenwriter
     was hot shit for you.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.003
    - I even have a virgin,

16:45.005 --> 16:46.237
       but I don't think
      you can afford that.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.040
       - When I get back,
        I want you gone.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.309
   - Oh, is this about money?

16:51.311 --> 16:52.744
 My 15 minutes of fame are up,

16:52.746 --> 16:54.545
     and I'm back to being
      a struggling nobody?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.214
          - Fuck you!

16:56.216 --> 16:58.216
     - What do you want me
      to do, quit writing?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.118
      Get a job I fucking
        hate, like you?

17:05.090 --> 17:06.491
    You're being ridiculous.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.092
   - I can't do this anymore,
       I don't want this.

17:08.094 --> 17:11.561
      ¶ Sweet baby blue a
     pleasure awaits you ¶

17:11.564 --> 17:12.797
     - Come on, Elizabeth.
     - This isn't working.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.464
- [Jack] You're all that I have.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.836
  Elizabeth, I'm begging you,
    you're all that I have.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.936
     - [Elizabeth] Get out.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.440
     - Where are you going?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.779
 Fine, I'll cancel the ticket.
     - No, no, don't cancel

17:27.781 --> 17:30.581
       the tickets, okay,
        go, go find her.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.951
     - Elizabeth, come on.
      - Get out of my way.

17:33.953 --> 17:36.287
      - Come on, come on.
       - Don't touch me,

17:36.289 --> 17:37.688
        get out my way!

17:37.690 --> 17:41.726
    Listen to me, when I get
     back I want you gone.

17:41.728 --> 17:46.798
    ¶ Heart off the floor ¶

17:47.667 --> 17:52.036
       ¶ Off the floor ¶

17:52.038 --> 17:54.772
       ¶ Off the floor ¶

18:39.786 --> 18:41.719
       (waitress speaking
      in foreign language)

18:41.721 --> 18:42.620
            - What?

18:44.224 --> 18:47.792
        - What would you
      like for breakfast?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.027
   - Eggs, bacon, and coffee.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.364
 (speaking in foreign language)

18:53.366 --> 18:56.501
      (gentle piano music)

19:00.540 --> 19:03.207
  - Morning, you look rested.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.543
           - If only.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.880
  - Do you need a guide today?

19:10.016 --> 19:11.549
           - A guide?

19:11.551 --> 19:14.352
     Can I bring my camera
       and my fanny pack?

19:14.354 --> 19:16.220
Will there be a gift shop, too?

19:16.222 --> 19:17.855
        - All right, you
     have a wonderful day.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.658
    And just know that I am
   here if you need anything.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.004
     - Hey you, no smoking.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.875
      How you doin', bro?
       - Good, I'm good.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.076
        Good to see you.

19:39.078 --> 19:39.977
        - Yeah, you too.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.681
         Put that out.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.623
- The most important thing we do

19:53.760 --> 19:55.826
      is that we make our
      guests feel at home.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.198
We want to create an experience

20:00.200 --> 20:02.266
         that will last
       with them forever.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.736
      We may not know what
       brought them here

20:05.738 --> 20:07.705
and we may never see them again,

20:08.942 --> 20:11.409
      but what we do know
     is that we can create

20:11.411 --> 20:13.377
       a journey that is
        a beautiful one.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.380
  All right, get back to work.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.984
   And be the peace that you
   want to see in the world.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.955
 (speaking in foreign language)

20:29.195 --> 20:31.662
          (soft music)

20:39.372 --> 20:42.373
          (bell rings)

20:42.375 --> 20:45.876
        - Girls, girls!

20:47.280 --> 20:49.547
    Who will it be tonight?

20:49.549 --> 20:51.616
  - No girls, just the drugs.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.551
        - It's a package
     deal, not a la carte.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.722
      - I just want to get
   high, not fuck a teenager.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.223
        - Then no drugs.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.993
- What is your fucking problem?

21:01.995 --> 21:04.362
   Can you see that the only
 thing I want to fuck right now

21:04.364 --> 21:05.830
        is my own mind?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.633
- I make the rules around here.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.502
         (eerie music)

21:11.504 --> 21:13.304
    - Jack, pick me tonight.

21:13.306 --> 21:16.774
    - And tonight the rules
      are drugs and girls,

21:16.776 --> 21:21.379
  or you can book a spa day at
   your little hotel instead.

21:21.381 --> 21:26.450
  - Jack, I will make you feel
 good tonight, like last night.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.518
             - No.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.854
        - Package deal.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.193
           - Fine...

21:40.400 --> 21:41.465
            ...her.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.653
              No.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.794
          Just dance.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.771
        (Jack coughing)

22:30.650 --> 22:34.118
    (traditional Thai music)

23:08.855 --> 23:11.856
       (soft piano music)

23:19.098 --> 23:21.132
        - What is that?

23:21.134 --> 23:22.500
   You're not bringing those.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.268
       - Gotta look sharp
        when you sleep.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.539
     - Trevor, you've been
       married too long.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.574
 - We're both taken men, right?

23:33.646 --> 23:36.013
    - Actually, I wanted to
  talk to you about Elizabeth.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.349
   We're not dating anymore.

23:43.022 --> 23:43.921
          - Seriously?

23:48.528 --> 23:51.495
 I guess this weekend just took
  a turn for the better, huh?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.399
 - I'm not up for any of that.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.373
           - One sec.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.113
        What about this?

24:10.650 --> 24:11.882
        - What is that?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.684
    - We're going to Vegas.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.952
       - Thought we were
     going mountain biking.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.454
       - No, how about we
       just go to Vegas?

24:16.456 --> 24:18.022
 Dude, I could be your wingman.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.893
      - Vegas is the last
      place I want to go.

24:22.895 --> 24:26.030
      (gentle piano music)

24:27.433 --> 24:28.332
        - Good morning.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.003
       - [Jack] Morning.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.172
   - How are you doing today?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.141
          - I'm swell.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.945
    - You know, people come
   here for so many reasons.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.613
         What's yours?

24:42.615 --> 24:44.415
- Why are any of us here, lady?

24:44.417 --> 24:47.351
       - I meet countless
    tourists coming through.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.119
         You look like
      you're here to stay.

24:49.989 --> 24:50.888
          Is that you?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.390
    - I haven't decided yet.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.727
           - Why not?

24:56.729 --> 24:58.329
    - What happened to your
      pep talk on the roof

24:58.331 --> 25:00.965
     about how the customer
        is always right,

25:00.967 --> 25:02.366
 or is that just for the help?

25:03.569 --> 25:05.669
     - I've just never seen
      someone look so sad

25:05.671 --> 25:07.705
   in such a beautiful place.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.341
    I just thought maybe you
   needed someone to talk to.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.078
      (suspenseful music)

25:14.080 --> 25:16.847
 - Thank you, but no thank you.

25:18.951 --> 25:19.850
            - Okay.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.098
          - Espresso.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.200
        - Are you okay?

25:37.236 --> 25:38.135
          - I'm fine.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.244
          - No hello?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.448
      Is something wrong?

25:51.450 --> 25:52.917
   - I would appreciate it if
    you'd stop following me,

25:52.919 --> 25:55.319
     and please stop prying
   into my personal business.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.955
       - Okay, did I say
   something wrong yesterday?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.456
    - How about five minutes
       ago while we were

25:59.458 --> 26:01.659
 having breakfast at the hotel.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.427
      - I don't know what
     you're talking about.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.229
  I've been here all morning.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.097
    - Five minutes ago while
    we were having breakfast

26:07.099 --> 26:09.333
    you told me what a sad a
    human being I was being.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.635
       - No, five minutes
     ago you weren't here.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.504
        - At the hotel.

26:13.506 --> 26:15.673
   We were both at the hotel!

26:15.675 --> 26:17.274
  - Okay, you don't look well,

26:17.276 --> 26:18.509
         do you want to
       come and sit down,

26:18.511 --> 26:19.476
     we'll talk about this?

26:19.478 --> 26:22.880
 - I think maybe later, thanks.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.449
         (eerie music)

27:15.601 --> 27:17.468
       - You need to pay.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.136
           - I will.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.606
       Give me my space.

27:29.415 --> 27:33.384
 (speaking in foreign language)

27:57.743 --> 27:59.276
    - Hey man, you come pay?

28:00.846 --> 28:02.246
     - Come on man, what do
     you hope to accomplish

28:02.248 --> 28:03.781
       going to Thailand?
   - Subject closed, Trevor,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.049
          back it off.

28:05.051 --> 28:08.118
      (suspenseful music)

28:22.334 --> 28:23.600
    Can you unlock the door?

28:25.838 --> 28:28.605
    - Seriously, my grandma
        thinks your hot.

28:28.607 --> 28:31.141
    My grandma thinks you're
    like smoking hot, right.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.178
      Hey Jack, what's up
    buddy, you want a beer?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.245
      - Yeah, definitely.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.947
    - What's up loner dude?
          - Hey dude.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.217
  - Of course some Thai beer.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.552
    Is there any other kind?

28:41.554 --> 28:43.454
  That guy, he's a character.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.689
Let me grab a chair real quick.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.192
 Hey, can I borrow this chair?

28:52.531 --> 28:55.199
    I've been meaning to ask
  you, like why are you here?

28:57.069 --> 28:59.603
      - I'm just taking a
     break from life, man.

28:59.605 --> 29:00.738
         - Life, dude?

29:04.043 --> 29:06.076
       I know why you're
      really here though.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.578
       Don't you even sit
        here and tell me

29:07.580 --> 29:09.947
  you're not here because you
 want some more of that green.

29:09.949 --> 29:13.217
  - No, massage parlor across
     the street has me set.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.252
  - She takes all my business.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.720
        - Where are you
       off to next, man?

29:16.722 --> 29:18.422
     - Do I need a fucking
    itinerary to drink here?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.958
       - Whoa, I was just
      trying to figure out

29:20.960 --> 29:22.893
 if you're the exploring type.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.129
          - Obviously.
      - Obviously, right.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.630
      All right, well then
    you're gonna love this.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.800
 We're gonna go check out this
  cave on the outside of town.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.703
    Inside the cave there's
   this Ascended Master guy.

29:32.705 --> 29:35.272
  This crazy folklore, people
   have been seeing this guy

29:35.274 --> 29:37.374
      walk around for like
        over 2000 years.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.676
 - He's totally at peace, man.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.478
      Couldn't you do with
       some of that shit?

29:42.815 --> 29:44.615
    - Are you guys serious?

29:44.617 --> 29:46.083
  - Yeah dude, we're serious.

29:46.085 --> 29:49.086
  It's like this legend, or I
guess it's more like a folktale,

29:49.088 --> 29:51.421
       or whatever but--
        - Like a ghost.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.590
       - Did anybody say
    ghost, did I say ghost?

29:53.592 --> 29:56.293
     It's not a ghost, it's
      an ascended master.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.528
         He's ascended.

29:57.530 --> 29:58.695
     - What does that mean?

30:00.032 --> 30:03.000
    - It means you no longer
  carry your past inside you.

30:04.336 --> 30:09.106
   - Yeah, okay, in layman's
 terms, you become pure light.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.341
  Like, you know what I mean?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.744
     There are no obstacles
    for the Ascended Master.

30:16.248 --> 30:19.249
             - Huh?
      - He's like Buddha.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.052
     Who gives a shit, man?

30:22.054 --> 30:23.821
   We're going to a cave and
  we're getting drunk, you in?

30:23.823 --> 30:25.622
    - Yeah dude, you should
      have just said that.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.457
            - Yeah!
       - Drunk in a cave.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.626
   - [Jack] Drunk in a cave.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.363
      - So where you been
       sleeping, exactly?

30:40.673 --> 30:41.872
  You'll stay with Jess and I

30:41.874 --> 30:43.273
         until you get
      things figured out.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.241
         - So, forever?

30:47.780 --> 30:49.379
I don't need your charity, bro.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.283
      - It's not charity,
       you're my brother.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.920
 But it better not be forever.

31:00.192 --> 31:05.262
        (birds chirping)
          (soft music)

31:14.673 --> 31:17.407
- Lemme guess, you haven't moved

31:17.409 --> 31:18.942
 since I saw you here yesterday

31:18.944 --> 31:21.044
         and your last
      chapter is finished?

31:21.046 --> 31:24.014
   - Not quite, let me guess,

31:24.016 --> 31:25.749
       you haven't slept
       because your mind

31:25.751 --> 31:28.318
      has been running on
    drugs, beer, and women.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.753
       - That's not fair.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.922
   I made an educated guess,
      you have the luxury

31:31.924 --> 31:34.191
      of smelling the beer
    sweating from my pores.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.460
   You want a cup of coffee?
            - Sure.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.934
         - Can I smoke?

31:43.936 --> 31:45.402
       - I can handle it.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.870
  You're not having breakfast
      at the hotel again?

31:46.872 --> 31:48.972
     - Not after yesterday.

31:48.974 --> 31:49.840
          - Yesterday?

31:52.344 --> 31:53.877
          - Thank you.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.045
      Let's not ruin this.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.283
      - [Gabriella] Okay.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.251
      - You love it here?

32:02.655 --> 32:05.789
       - I do, I like the
     serenity, the beauty,

32:06.659 --> 32:08.091
     the peace, everywhere.

32:09.995 --> 32:10.894
       - Not everywhere.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.697
     - Well, there are two
      sides to this place

32:13.699 --> 32:16.199
   but I like to acknowledge
        the bright side.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.568
    We all have a choice in
     that, don't you think?

32:20.139 --> 32:21.405
       - You're really a
    writer, you're not just

32:21.407 --> 32:23.340
      another lonely lady
       with a note book?

32:24.543 --> 32:26.143
- Yeah, I'm really am a writer.

32:27.046 --> 32:27.945
            - Sorry.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.314
  - Is that why you are here?

32:31.684 --> 32:33.750
   - It's not why I came, but
    it could be why I stay.

32:33.752 --> 32:34.851
     At least for a while.

32:36.221 --> 32:38.055
  - You know, many people come
 here and they don't know why.

32:38.057 --> 32:38.956
          Is that you?

32:39.825 --> 32:41.391
  - No, I know why I am here.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.663
 See, I'm close, I can feel it.

32:50.536 --> 32:51.868
   I'm looking for my mother.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.472
 - Any idea where she might be?

32:55.474 --> 32:58.842
 - No, apparently, if you leave
   your kids and your husband

32:58.844 --> 33:01.812
  when you're 29, and you head
 to Thailand you can disappear.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.448
- What kind of mother does that?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.551
            - Mine.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.055
 Elizabeth, Elizabeth, come on,

33:12.057 --> 33:13.557
        listen, please.
      - No, I don't care.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.459
   You understand me, I don't
    care if you pay me back.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.860
    - [Jack] Just Elizabeth,
       just come with me

33:16.862 --> 33:18.095
      to Thailand, please.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.262
      - [Elizabeth] You're
       a fucking addict.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.298
     It's over, all right,
        stop calling me.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.599
       How many times do
       have to tell you?

33:22.601 --> 33:24.101
     I should have left you
    - Elizabeth, Elizabeth.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.502
            Please.
 - years ago, like your mother.

33:45.991 --> 33:46.957
          - You okay?

33:51.563 --> 33:52.996
    Jack, come on, let's go.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.036
             Jack!

34:05.844 --> 34:07.744
  - [Gabriella] Are you okay?

34:07.746 --> 34:08.645
          - I'm fine.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.283
     I'm just realizing as
     I am trying to escape

34:13.284 --> 34:15.719
      the ruins of my life
   that there's one problem.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.155
You can't escape your own mind,

34:19.257 --> 34:20.690
       that shit follows
        you everywhere.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.427
 - Yeah, the mind never quits.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.695
I mean, it's like it's own form,

34:25.697 --> 34:28.297
     until we realize that
       we can control it.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.601
       - Yeah but, how do
       you control this?

34:31.603 --> 34:34.603
        This thing has a
        mind of its own.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.206
           - I know.
     - You know, this thing

34:36.208 --> 34:40.110
      is filling my skull
      with so much noise.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.710
   - Well, there's this man,

34:41.713 --> 34:43.213
      and he's called the
        ascended master.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.748
   - No, no, no, not you too.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.283
  - Really Jack, he lives in a
  cave right outside of town.

34:46.284 --> 34:50.719
 And if he reveals himself, the
  mind instantly stops, okay.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.422
      No more chatter, and
    you're forever changed.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.623
      - How does everybody
        know about this

34:54.626 --> 34:56.426
    Ascended Master but me?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.228
        - Well maybe you
        should find out.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.496
        - Jesus Christ.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.997
  - (chuckles) He was one too.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.232
       - I have an idea.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.801
       How about I go to
      this cave and I ask

35:04.803 --> 35:07.471
     this 2000 year old man
   why my mother abandoned me

35:07.473 --> 35:10.006
    and what I'm even doing
     here looking for her?

35:10.008 --> 35:11.875
    - I, I think you should.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.911
  Why not, you may see a sign.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.247
  Often people have the signs
     right in front of them

35:17.249 --> 35:18.782
 and they don't even see them.

35:18.784 --> 35:19.850
       Maybe that's you?

35:21.620 --> 35:24.020
        - It's always a
    pleasure talking to you.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.289
- Why beat around the bullshit?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.458
     - I'm just looking to
      escape the bullshit.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.900
         (eerie music)

36:16.441 --> 36:19.576
       - [Trevor] You're
      not gonna find her.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.313
    - Key doesn't work, man.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.848
     - Key work yesterday?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.249
            - Yeah.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.485
     - Then key work today.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.287
        Lock no change.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.323
     - No, I'm telling you
   that the key doesn't work.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.492
       Now I need to get
      into my hotel room.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.826
     - Don't speak English.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.862
            - What?

36:38.864 --> 36:41.464
      - No speak English.

36:41.466 --> 36:44.034
   - You just spoke English.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.269
Now, let me into my hotel room.

36:47.406 --> 36:51.708
 - Go see Clare, she help you.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.316
       - Can you help me?

37:01.954 --> 37:04.187
         - I'm not sure
     anybody can help you.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.457
- What is that supposed to mean?

37:07.459 --> 37:09.593
        - You still have
        a bill here kid.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.561
        - I know and I'm
     gonna pay it in full.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.296
           - Really?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.499
 - Room seven has door problem.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.001
       - Did you fix it?

37:18.003 --> 37:19.436
     - His problem to fix.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.571
       - We talked about
        this, remember?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.773
       You fix the small
     problems so the guests

37:23.775 --> 37:25.842
       can focus on more
       important things.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.011
         - I try again.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.983
   - My key isn't working and
   the guy at the front desk

37:32.985 --> 37:34.985
     won't seem to help me,
     but he seems to think

37:34.987 --> 37:35.952
       that you can help.

37:37.089 --> 37:39.789
     - They only help those
     that help themselves.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.524
 - What are you talking about?

37:41.526 --> 37:46.596
     - (chuckles) I'll send
      someone with a key.

37:46.832 --> 37:47.597
        Wait next door.

37:58.277 --> 38:02.879
     - Your guest is making
   his problems my problems.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.282
       - You created the
     problem to begin with.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.717
- I'm so tired of your customers

38:07.719 --> 38:10.287
    bringing their bullshit
     issues into my house.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.422
     - Just go back to your
    people, we're fixing it.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.625
      - My people are your
     people, you know that.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.894
 - My people choose a way out.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.162
  - Fuck you, I'm telling him.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.196
        - No, you can't.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.499
         - Oh, can't I?

38:22.501 --> 38:25.135
      - You'll take us all
    down, and you know that.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.673
 - I am already living in hell,
   what does it matter to me?

38:30.976 --> 38:31.875
         - Where is he?

38:36.782 --> 38:39.816
 - Did you send Jack to Clare?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.017
        - He need help.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.687
      - She's not going to
    help him, you know that.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.155
       - But he looking.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.657
    - He needs to find what
  he's looking for by himself.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.761
      (suspenseful music)

39:13.452 --> 39:15.752
  - [Nick] Wait up, you guys.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.723
     You see anything yet?

39:19.725 --> 39:21.791
      - [Kai] Nothing but
      this 20 foot Buddha.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.309
        - You know, from
       what I understand

39:40.645 --> 39:43.947
 you have to ask him to change
   something about your life.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.450
   He'll appear or something.

39:50.188 --> 39:55.091
  - All right, let's see if he
can change my entire life then.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.993
   That sounds simple enough.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.829
       - Just one thing,
       change one thing.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.164
    - My life is one thing.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.166
     It's a singular noun.

40:21.553 --> 40:25.755
          - I see him!

40:25.757 --> 40:27.824
   I see him guys, I see him.

40:27.826 --> 40:28.725
        - [Jack] No way.

40:29.995 --> 40:30.927
     - You really see him?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.028
   - [Jack] There is no way.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.596
      - I see him, there!

40:33.598 --> 40:36.266
      - There's no way you
    see a 2000 year old man

40:36.268 --> 40:37.734
       living in a cave.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.803
      - You don't believe,
   man, that's your problem.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.738
- Yeah dude, just try believing.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.073
 Just try it for five seconds.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.709
    Like, everything you see
  is just a belief, you know.

40:56.521 --> 40:57.454
       - Reveal yourself.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.458
       - Try again with a
      little more passion.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.762
       - Reveal yourself!

41:09.201 --> 41:12.001
        Reveal yourself,
      you ascended master.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.938
    I've one problem that I
     definitely need fixed.

41:16.408 --> 41:18.708
       Please remove the
      asshole from my body

41:18.710 --> 41:21.110
   that makes me an asshole.

41:23.582 --> 41:26.616
     I believe, I believe,

41:26.618 --> 41:28.685
        that I could use
    another beer right now.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.788
  - All right well, we tried.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.659
He doesn't speak for all of us.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.269
    Did you really see him?

41:46.271 --> 41:47.136
        - I swear, man.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.206
    - What did he look like?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.574
            - Dusty.
            - Dusty?

41:53.979 --> 41:57.113
      (gentle piano music)

42:52.637 --> 42:54.771
  - [Gabriella] Did you sleep?

42:54.773 --> 42:56.673
       - All right, let's
     talk about you today.

42:58.677 --> 43:01.177
     What's a dame like you
   doing in a dump like this?

43:02.047 --> 43:02.946
           - Why not?

43:05.283 --> 43:07.016
   - You gonna me tell you've
   got life all figured out?

43:07.018 --> 43:07.917
          - Certainly.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.588
      - Okay, I know what
     you're writing about.

43:11.590 --> 43:14.457
      You're writing about
    how your wealthy husband

43:14.459 --> 43:17.260
   left you for a transgender
     priest living in Oslo.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.096
            - Close.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.631
   - Well, now you know what
     kind of book I'd read.

43:21.633 --> 43:22.532
           - Really?

43:25.670 --> 43:27.670
       - I know what you
      should write about.

43:27.672 --> 43:31.441
   You should write about how
    pharmaceutical companies

43:31.443 --> 43:33.476
    are bribing the doctors
        to overprescribe

43:33.478 --> 43:35.745
        anti-depressants
      and ADD medication.

43:40.919 --> 43:43.586
   - I feel like you may know
  a little bit more about that

43:43.588 --> 43:44.721
      than you'd like to.

43:46.257 --> 43:47.924
 - You know, they've just been
   such a big part of my life

43:47.926 --> 43:49.993
    for a such a long time.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.394
        It's hard to get
       off the treadmill.

43:51.396 --> 43:53.596
      - Yeah, I guess the
      only thing we can do

43:53.598 --> 43:56.799
 is end our own vicious cycle.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.568
I mean, if each person did that.

43:58.570 --> 44:00.970
   - Were you a kindergarten
   teacher in your past life?

44:00.972 --> 44:04.040
     - (chuckles) I know it
   sounds overly simplified,

44:04.042 --> 44:07.210
     but karma or whatever
      you want to call it,

44:07.212 --> 44:08.444
    It catches up with you.

44:10.081 --> 44:12.582
Even if someone doesn't see it,

44:12.584 --> 44:16.919
     you are, quite simply,
    the sum of your choices.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.867
      - Will you just sit
       up front with me?

44:30.869 --> 44:32.001
         This is crazy.

44:32.937 --> 44:34.070
      - Just ask already.

44:37.008 --> 44:39.475
     - I shouldn't have to
   ask, you know that, right?

44:39.477 --> 44:40.877
    You should just tell me.

44:44.883 --> 44:46.983
Okay, is it an insurance thing,

44:46.985 --> 44:49.752
    like you can't get 'em,
   or is it a fuck you meds?

44:50.955 --> 44:52.221
     Or is this one of your

44:52.223 --> 44:54.490
      I don't need them--
      - I don't like them.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.827
      I don't like the way
       they make me feel.

45:07.839 --> 45:10.406
         (engine revs)

45:11.743 --> 45:14.744
   - [Trevor] (sighs) There's
 gotta be some kind of solution

45:14.746 --> 45:16.479
        that keeps you--
           - Sedated?

45:20.752 --> 45:23.386
         (gentle music)

46:50.942 --> 46:56.012
       ¶ It's a choice ¶

46:57.448 --> 47:02.451
          ¶ To stay ¶

47:03.021 --> 47:08.057
        ¶ It's a dream ¶

47:08.760 --> 47:13.396
     ¶ And I want to wake ¶

47:14.933 --> 47:18.835
¶ You are blood on your hands ¶

47:20.238 --> 47:22.772
 - When we get back, I'm gonna
 make sure that you're covered.

47:24.843 --> 47:27.577
     Dad and I'll find you
      a plan of some kind.

47:27.579 --> 47:30.246
  Something that lets you keep
  your edge, so you can write,

47:30.248 --> 47:34.951
    but, but also keeps you
     from being a dickhead.

47:34.953 --> 47:38.521
    - Cool, you go find that
   magical little substance.

47:38.523 --> 47:39.789
 - Fuck you, you need the meds.

47:39.791 --> 47:41.157
   - You need me on the meds.

47:41.159 --> 47:43.793
        You and dad and
    Jessica need to keep me

47:43.795 --> 47:45.027
      as a little zombie.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.629
       - That's bullshit
        and you know it.

47:46.631 --> 47:47.530
   - Let me out of this car.

47:47.532 --> 47:48.798
     - We're almost there.

47:48.800 --> 47:49.465
       - If you don't let
       me out of this car

47:49.467 --> 47:50.399
        I'm jumping out.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.134
  - You're not gonna jump out.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.636
      Jack, Jack, dammit.

47:57.575 --> 47:58.474
             Jack.

48:02.213 --> 48:06.515
 (pop music in the background.

48:06.517 --> 48:10.353
       - Buddy, bad news,
      I'm all out of weed.

48:11.656 --> 48:13.189
      But we can probably
         go score some

48:13.191 --> 48:14.624
  across the street, I think.

48:16.694 --> 48:19.595
   - I was kind of hoping to
could avoid that place tonight.

48:19.597 --> 48:21.664
      - [Nick] Sorry dude,
     but if you want weed.

48:28.806 --> 48:31.674
       - [Jack] Hey, have
      you seen this woman?

48:34.746 --> 48:37.980
   - [Nick] Maybe you should
   ask her in Thai. (laughs)

48:38.983 --> 48:39.916
         She might have
     thought you were just

48:39.918 --> 48:41.050
trying to give her a photograph.

48:54.532 --> 48:56.599
 - Opium and the same gal, eh?

48:56.601 --> 48:57.833
     - No, just some weed.

48:57.835 --> 49:01.137
    - Aww, my girl not fuck
     you right last night?

49:01.139 --> 49:04.340
   - It was fine, can I just
   have a hit and a massage?

49:04.342 --> 49:05.641
        Just a massage.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.243
  - I'll discount her tonight.

49:07.245 --> 49:08.711
        - No, thank you.

49:08.713 --> 49:10.746
      - $5 for a blow job.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.248
       - Who do you think
         you are, lady?

49:12.250 --> 49:15.184
       You can't force me
     to fuck a prostitute.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.686
      - My name is Clare.

49:16.688 --> 49:19.956
   - Okay, Clare, can I just
    get a hit and a massage,

49:19.958 --> 49:22.591
    without anyone trying to
     touch my dick, please?

49:24.862 --> 49:29.799
    - Yes, tonight that will
    be acceptable, room 10.

49:29.801 --> 49:30.700
          - Thank you.

49:38.743 --> 49:41.544
        (dramatic music)

49:59.163 --> 50:04.233
       No, no, I said no.

50:06.504 --> 50:07.870
        - But I want to.

50:08.973 --> 50:11.707
- I said stop, okay, get off me.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.377
          Get off me.

50:19.250 --> 50:20.216
          Get off me.

50:27.091 --> 50:30.993
 (singing in foreign language)

50:44.308 --> 50:47.076
        (birds chirping)

50:53.584 --> 50:56.485
         Hey, man, I'm
     waiting on some money

50:56.487 --> 50:58.454
to come through from back home.

50:58.456 --> 50:59.789
 Is there anyway I could have--

50:59.791 --> 51:02.024
  - No problem, you good man.

51:03.061 --> 51:05.928
        - Let's not get
     crazy, but thank you.

51:11.502 --> 51:12.968
 Okay, nothing spiritual today,

51:12.970 --> 51:14.737
        let's just talk
       about the weather.

51:15.540 --> 51:17.540
  - And that's not spiritual?

51:17.542 --> 51:19.308
- I miss the weather back home.

51:19.310 --> 51:20.309
  - [Gabriella] Where's home?

51:20.311 --> 51:22.411
         - Los Angeles.
           - Really?

51:22.413 --> 51:24.180
      - But I'm originally
         from Vermont.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.949
 - What did you do last night?

51:28.686 --> 51:29.885
        - How I spend my
       days are different

51:29.887 --> 51:31.287
  than how I spend my nights.

51:34.826 --> 51:35.724
            - Jack.

51:39.931 --> 51:40.796
              Hey.

51:43.201 --> 51:44.200
      - Give me the keys.

51:45.736 --> 51:47.736
 I'm driving, give me the keys.

51:49.107 --> 51:51.941
    - If I give you the keys
  you'll get back in the car?

51:51.943 --> 51:52.808
             - Yes.

51:57.148 --> 52:00.549
     (footsteps crunching)

52:00.551 --> 52:03.486
     - Hey, hey, listen to
    me, we're almost there.

52:03.488 --> 52:04.753
    It's right up this hill.

52:04.755 --> 52:06.555
     I've been here before,
     you're gonna love it.

52:08.493 --> 52:10.359
   - [Jack] We're going home.

52:10.361 --> 52:13.762
      - What, I'm driving.

52:13.764 --> 52:14.964
 - [Jack] If you want to drive,

52:14.966 --> 52:17.266
       I'm walking home.
         - I'm driving.

52:17.268 --> 52:21.904
       Okay, okay, fine,
        you're driving.

52:23.875 --> 52:25.608
         (engine revs)

52:25.610 --> 52:26.976
         - [Jack] What
      chapter are you on?

52:28.379 --> 52:30.412
   - You said you can't talk
   about anything spiritual.

52:30.414 --> 52:32.114
       - Okay, I got it,
      I got it, I got it.

52:32.116 --> 52:33.549
      - Is there anything
        else off limits?

52:33.551 --> 52:35.551
     'Cause I'd hate to ask
      the wrong question.

52:35.553 --> 52:38.521
     - Okay, let me see the
      book, let me see it.

52:41.325 --> 52:44.160
        (engine revving)

52:47.331 --> 52:48.931
  Life and death are the same

52:48.933 --> 52:51.600
     after you rid yourself
     of your karmic energy.

52:56.641 --> 52:59.708
- Consider Pandora's Box opened.

53:04.048 --> 53:06.615
         (eerie music)

53:19.263 --> 53:20.496
      - [Jack] One minute.

53:20.498 --> 53:22.198
       - My boss say you
        have to pay now.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.999
       - I will, just let
       me just send this,

53:24.001 --> 53:25.267
  and I'll get you your money.

53:25.269 --> 53:28.537
      - No, leave now, no
      money, no computer.

53:32.043 --> 53:33.609
            Get out!
   - Do you recognize this--

53:33.611 --> 53:36.512
      - No, no, no, leave
        now, leave now.

53:36.514 --> 53:37.913
        Get out of here.

53:49.527 --> 53:52.161
         - Just face it
     Trevor, I'm a fuck up.

53:52.163 --> 53:55.898
        No job, no life,
       no girl, no home.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.733
 - Take it easy, slow it down.

53:57.735 --> 53:58.968
  - Don't tell me what to do.

53:58.970 --> 54:01.203
     - [Trevor] No, I, I'm
    not, just slow it down.

54:01.205 --> 54:04.173
   - I am not a kid anymore.

54:04.175 --> 54:05.641
    - Nobody said you were.

54:05.643 --> 54:08.010
     Come on man, I have a
   family at home, slow down!

54:09.580 --> 54:12.147
         (tense music)

54:47.752 --> 54:51.887
(people chattering and laughing)

55:00.398 --> 55:02.231
     - A short and a tall.

55:03.534 --> 55:06.502
           - Jackie!
     - What, no Thai beer?

55:12.777 --> 55:14.310
  - Hey man, what's up buddy?

55:14.312 --> 55:16.512
   - I never thanked you for
   that trip you sent me on.

55:16.514 --> 55:17.813
 - Dude, I'm glad you liked it.

55:17.815 --> 55:21.684
     - Oh, I loved it man,
    the scenery, fresh air.

55:21.686 --> 55:24.453
- Well, we're gonna re-up again
  in like an hour in my room.

55:24.455 --> 55:25.921
       - That means I got
      like an hour to get

55:25.923 --> 55:28.190
   a bunch of women and booze
     up to your hotel room.

55:28.192 --> 55:29.625
        - [Nick] I think
       you can handle it.

55:29.627 --> 55:31.060
    - Dude, I can handle it.

55:31.062 --> 55:32.928
      - Perfect, well I'm
   gonna get things started.

55:32.930 --> 55:35.431
          (rock music)

56:02.426 --> 56:06.028
   - [Jack] Trevor! (sobbing)

56:06.030 --> 56:09.932
 (singing in foreign language)

56:34.058 --> 56:38.127
(people shouting in background)

56:49.306 --> 56:51.540
   - Get out of my bag, dude.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.076
       - Are you serious?

56:56.414 --> 56:58.981
       - Yeah man, we did
       it all, it's gone.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.519
        What time is it?

57:03.521 --> 57:05.120
        - It's like six.

57:05.122 --> 57:06.355
 - I think it's a little early

57:06.357 --> 57:07.823
        to start another
       bender, don't you.

57:11.562 --> 57:14.563
   Dude I like you, you gotta
    get your shit together.

57:17.501 --> 57:18.867
   - This from a drug dealer.

57:26.277 --> 57:28.944
- [Nick] Why are you here, man?

57:30.147 --> 57:31.380
 - I'm trying to do more drugs,

57:31.382 --> 57:34.016
       but my drug dealer
      is being an asshole.

57:34.018 --> 57:37.052
       - No, I mean, you
       don't belong here.

57:37.054 --> 57:39.455
  Like why did you come here?

57:42.359 --> 57:45.394
  - You know why I'm here man,
   I'm looking for my mother.

57:45.396 --> 57:47.329
        - Drugs help you
       find your mother?

57:47.331 --> 57:48.230
          - [Jack] No.

57:49.533 --> 57:50.899
    - So, why are you here?

57:53.504 --> 57:54.670
     - I killed my brother.

58:02.446 --> 58:03.479
      It was an accident.

58:05.583 --> 58:06.482
            - Jesus.

58:10.221 --> 58:11.620
  - You gonna help me or not?

58:12.556 --> 58:15.757
    - (sighs) I can't dude.

58:17.962 --> 58:19.828
        I only assist in
        drugs that help.

58:22.900 --> 58:27.102
 - Fuck you, they are helping.

58:33.043 --> 58:34.776
 I'll get them somewhere else.

58:40.885 --> 58:42.351
       - I bet you will.

58:45.756 --> 58:48.724
       (tense rock music)

58:59.370 --> 59:02.304
     ¶ They're saying a lot
      of bad, bad things ¶

59:02.306 --> 59:05.974
       ¶ About you girl ¶

59:05.976 --> 59:09.044
     ¶ They're saying a lot
      of bad, bad things ¶

59:09.046 --> 59:12.915
         ¶ About you ¶

59:12.917 --> 59:15.083
¶ Honey what I want to know is ¶

59:15.085 --> 59:19.321
  ¶ Are the bad things true ¶

59:19.323 --> 59:22.424
     ¶ They're saying a lot
      of bad, bad things ¶

59:22.426 --> 59:25.260
       ¶ About you girl ¶

59:39.143 --> 59:42.210
      (suspenseful music)

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.743
  - [Man] Is this Jack Shore?

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:17.112
        (Jack screaming)

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.981
      This is Charles from
       the funeral home.

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.917
  We've had Trevor Shore here

01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:25.854
 for the last two days without
   instructions, or payment.

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.724
   What would you like to do?

01:00:30.394 --> 01:00:32.527
      I can take a credit
      card over the phone

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:34.630
      and we can at least
      start preparing him

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:39.635
        for the funeral.
       (door clattering)

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:42.504
       (heavy breathing)

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:16.571
   - You came back, surprise.

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:20.075
 - I don't want any more women.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:23.445
    Just give me the stuff.

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:28.517
       - Stuff, now, now,
       Jack, say please.

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.054
    - You aren't my mother,
    lady, sell me the drugs.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:35.490
      - No, it's a package
   deal, you know that Jack.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:39.127
   - You're a drug dealer and
   I need drugs, do your job.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:45.567
    - You don't tell me what
     my job is, young man.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:48.170
      For starters, you've
     have an open tab here

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:50.806
         that I have so
      generously extended.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:54.776
  And second, if you want your
   stuff, you take it my way.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.249
    - What is going on here?

01:02:02.953 --> 01:02:05.387
       - I know what you
        need, Jacky boy.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.588
          - Fuck you.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.223
   - You need a woman, Jack!

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.658
       - Fuck you, lady.

01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:22.037
           (knocking)

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:43.959
 - [Man] Put him on the phone,

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:45.527
put him on the phone now, Jack.

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:48.830
      - I'm so sorry, dad.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.801
     - [Man] Put him on the
      phone now, now, no.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:04.639
         (gentle music)

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:05.533
        (water rushing)

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.465
         (eerie music)

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:50.712
             - Hey.

01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:57.118
    You're probably the only
    person I haven't asked.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.420
   Have you seen this woman?

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.790
   - Don't know white people
    in Chiang Rai, only you.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.392
     - You know Gabriella.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:06.494
          - And Clare.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:18.273
        (birds chirping)

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:27.749
        - Oh, thanks for
        meeting me here.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:30.151
        - No worries, I
     needed some fresh air.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.386
     - How are you feeling?

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:33.521
       - I've been okay,
        I've been good.

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.056
I've been sober for three days.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:38.293
  - Well that's great, okay, I
  want to show you something.

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:45.633
         (gentle music)

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:56.344
      We' re all on a path
     that is ever evolving

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.980
  and one has to accept that.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:08.690
       Life is just about
     repeating old patterns

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:09.824
     until they're broken.

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:15.764
       - [Jack] You know,
      I live in this state

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:16.898
     of perpetual movement.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:19.267
      See I am on a bike!

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.970
         Am I learning?

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:27.042
 - [Gabriella] Yes! (chuckles)

01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:56.104
         - I guess the
      question really is,

01:07:58.809 --> 01:08:01.743
    at any given moment what
    direction are we going?

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:05.180
   - Yeah but, we have to be
    going somewhere, right?

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:06.614
  This can't be all there is.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:20.095
 (chanting in foreign language)

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:29.537
    - [Gabriella] You know,
    Jack, you can trust me.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:32.439
        - I know, oddly
      enough, I know that.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:36.877
      - Talking about your
       brother can really

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.345
     make you feel better.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.986
       - How did you know
       about my brother?

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:48.055
 - Well, men say strange things
 in the throes of withdrawals.

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:00.435
  - I don't know what to say.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:05.607
    I killed my brother and
     I hate myself for it.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:10.111
       It's been 12 days,

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.950
        and I'm finally
       feeling something.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.787
   Not better, but something.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.627
   - Let's go in the temple.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.273
   - [Jack] Tried finding any
 business owned by an American

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.908
   and the owner of the hotel
     was trying to help me,

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:42.010
  but you know, no such luck.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.581
       - [Nick] Have you
     tried the whore house?

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.948
   That's run by an American.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:51.653
       - I don't think my
       mother is running

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.020
   a whore house in Thailand.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:58.293
        (Thai pop music)

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:04.232
 (singing in foreign language)

01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.701
- I knew I could find you here.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.871
      You know, you have a
    bill you need to pay up.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.873
      - I will, the money
         is on its way.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.375
       - Fine, take him.

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:17.845
        (up beat music)

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:29.424
      I'm done waiting for
      you to choose, Jack,

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:30.358
        you choose now.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.526
  - The money is coming, okay.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:32.961
 My father is sending me money.

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.629
      - I don't care about
        the money, son.

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:36.130
   This is all I care about.

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:38.700
         (tense music)

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.003
     Throw him over there.

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:45.873
   - You'll be taking this to
  the airport for us tonight.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.375
        - Are you out of
       your fucking mind?

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:49.477
       Why are you people
       doing this to me?

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.512
       - You either take
      that to the airport,

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:52.947
 or the next delivery you make

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.283
will be from inside that cooler.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:58.019
       - No, no, no, you
       people are crazy.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:01.422
- Jackie, don't be so dramatic.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.372
        He is waking up,
       get him, get him.

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:20.408
   We are not getting caught.

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:24.178
     - It's you, the whole
  fucking time it's been you.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.615
  - I've been here for you the
   whole time son, come home.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.450
     Get him, get him now!

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.553
      Bring my baby home!

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:35.623
      (intense pop music)

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.942
         (eerie music)

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:18.466
        (dramatic music)

01:12:36.152 --> 01:12:37.385
         - I need help.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:39.287
       - Finally, you see
        I can help you.

01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:42.023
  - No, this isn't a joke, is
 there a place that I can hide?

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:44.092
- You cannot hide forever, Jack.

01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:46.094
   - Help me, please help me!
    - It's time to wake up.

01:12:46.096 --> 01:12:47.395
   - Where is the back door?

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:53.568
         - Hello Jack.

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.404
   - What are you doing here?

01:12:57.807 --> 01:12:59.440
    It doesn't matter, okay,
   I have to get out of here.

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:00.708
            - Where?
          - Anywhere!

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.543
        Is there a place
        that I can hide?

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:06.681
 - So you're choosing my help?
             - Yes.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:09.217
    - You're choosing help?
      - Jesus Christ, yes!

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.185
I'm choosing you and your help.

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:12.086
        - Come with me.

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:27.301
       Jack, you have to
      forgive yourself for
     killing your brother.

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:30.638
  - Forgive myself, here, now?

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.040
      - It's the only way
      to break the cycle.

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:36.277
     You haven't paid your
       debt spiritually.

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:38.846
         It's not money
      that you owe, okay.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.681
       You can't bargain
     yourself out of this.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:42.250
      - Just please stop.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.118
  - You can't escape anymore.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.589
 You need to decide if you want
   to live in heaven or hell.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.192
  - What does that mean, what
    kind of choice is that?

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:53.094
     - It's the choice you
    made when you went back

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:58.166
  into the massage parlor over
 and over, why did you do that?

01:13:58.835 --> 01:13:59.967
    - How do you know that?

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:01.436
            - Jack.
        - No, answer me.

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:03.471
  - She is not gonna help you.

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:06.641
     She's only gonna take
     you further into hell.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.910
     - Who, the prostitute?

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:11.012
         - Your mother.

01:14:18.655 --> 01:14:20.321
       - How do you know
        she's my mother?

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:21.823
    - How did you not know?

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.425
 What does that say about her,

01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:27.195
      what she is and what
       she's done to you?

01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:28.930
    Where you actually are.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.468
Do you know where you are Jack?

01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:37.572
      Where are you going?

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:40.441
        Jack, come back.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:44.479
         (tense music)

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.076
           - Hey dad.

01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:24.919
I don't need your charity, bro.

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:36.230
     - [Woman] Jack, where
      are you going, Jack?

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:01.155
     - [Gabriella] You have
    to accept what you did.

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:05.927
     Just open the package.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.194
   - [Jack] I don't want to.

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:08.029
     - [Gabriella] Because
     you know what's in it.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.697
     Just open it, please.

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:12.600
       Open the package.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:21.142
      (gentle piano music)

01:17:29.946 --> 01:17:32.680
        (door creaking)

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.388
         (tense music)

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:46.527
    - Oh my God, I did that.

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:51.332
           - You did.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:57.138
    - So I'm dead, I've been
     dead this whole time?

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:02.376
      - Yes, you'll never
        quiet the mind.

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.445
     Until the mind quiets.

01:18:04.447 --> 01:18:05.780
     - It's not that easy.

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:07.948
          - It can be.

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:11.952
     Just forgive yourself
      and you can be free.

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.155
   Then you get out of Bardo.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:20.561
   - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:26.200
 - I know, it's all right bro.

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:30.638
        You just have to
       make one more step

01:18:31.607 --> 01:18:33.307
   before you're truly free.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.013
       - [Jack] What are
        you doing here?

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:42.083
      - I have always been
      here, Jack, always.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.755
           I am you.

01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:52.093
  I was you in your last life.

01:18:53.362 --> 01:18:57.531
  There we realized everything
      we see and perceive

01:18:57.533 --> 01:19:00.134
 is a reflection of our karma.

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:05.206
    But when we are reborn,
    you forgot it all again.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:10.544
Jack, you cannot escape it now.

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:12.246
      You can't escape me.

01:19:13.683 --> 01:19:15.716
         This is Bardo.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.987
         (eerie music)

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:29.063
         (gentle music)

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:35.069
    You will keep on living
   these aspects of your life

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:39.406
      over and over again
      until you reconcile

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:42.042
  or eradicate your darkness.

01:19:45.915 --> 01:19:50.417
      Wake up, Jack, this
        is your choice.

01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:04.698
      - [Jack] My choice.

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:08.836
     It's my choice to live
       in heaven or hell?

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:13.908
  Why didn't I choose to live?

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:19.780
    Because I couldn't live
      with myself anymore.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:25.452
    So now I have to forgive
 myself for killing my brother.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:29.924
       Forgive myself for
      taking my own life.

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:35.996
    I just thought I escaped
  life, but life never stops.

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:38.632
  It just changes dimensions.

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:44.071
    I didn't know I was dead
   when I entered the hotel.

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:47.675
   I didn't know every time I
   had a thought in the past

01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:49.410
  it was me reviewing my life.

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:52.546
    I didn't know my mother
       died in Thailand.

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:54.815
   I just wanted to find her.

01:20:57.887 --> 01:20:59.954
     So even in my death I
      was still searching.

01:21:04.594 --> 01:21:07.194
   Heaven and hell is a state
    of mind that never ends.

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:10.064
      It's consciousness.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.769
    It's just consciousness,
  either in life or in death.

01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:19.206
     (upbeat guitar music)

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.475
     Well I guess now that
     I've awakened to that,

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:25.312
   let's get the hell out of
    here and get to heaven.

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:30.317
    ¶ Wake me, wake me up ¶

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:34.355
¶ Wake me up when we get there ¶

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:37.524
   ¶ Wake me up, wake me up ¶

01:21:37.526 --> 01:21:41.629
       ¶ Anything goes in
        the neon south ¶

01:21:41.631 --> 01:21:45.099
 ¶ Four nights and three days ¶

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:48.569
       ¶ It's an odyssey
     though just the same ¶

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:52.239
       ¶ But in a colored
    room to turn you over ¶

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:55.843
       ¶ Purple face but
       my smile remains ¶

01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:59.146
   ¶ Wake me up, wake me up ¶

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:02.917
¶ Wake me up when we get there ¶

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:06.120
   ¶ Wake me up, wake me up ¶

01:22:06.122 --> 01:22:10.357
       ¶ Anything goes in
        the neon south ¶

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:27.508
       (insects buzzing)
        (birds chirping)

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:31.111
   - [Jack] You're up early.

01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:33.981
       - I didn't sleep.

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:36.116
           - Jet lag?

01:22:36.886 --> 01:22:39.586
     - (chuckles) Jet lag?

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:45.926
     You have no idea what
       I've been through.

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:47.361
     - You'd be surprised.

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:50.664
     I've been there about
       a thousand times.

01:22:53.336 --> 01:22:57.271
    ¶ Oh lord, lord, lord ¶

01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:00.908
      ¶ Lord, lord, lord ¶

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:04.778
      ¶ Lord, lord, lord ¶

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.781
      ¶ Lord, lord, lord ¶

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:11.585
  ¶ Life ain't not go alibi ¶

01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:15.456
 ¶ Death is ready to be tried ¶

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:19.093
       ¶ Love was caught
       right in the eye ¶

01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:23.063
         ¶ Just when it
      pulled the trigger ¶

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:26.934
      ¶ Drop that weapon,
         put it down ¶

01:23:26.936 --> 01:23:30.804
        ¶ Put your hands
       up, turn around ¶

01:23:30.806 --> 01:23:34.508
      ¶ Read your rights,
      face to the ground ¶

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:38.545

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:42.349
     ¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ¶
