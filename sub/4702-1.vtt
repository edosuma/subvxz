00:54.722 --> 00:57.056
What's this "having a picnic" shit
in my car?

00:57.850 --> 01:01.477
Please, man, I'm not getting sex
at home. Don't deny me this.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.938
You sleep with
a beautiful woman nightly.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.818
I'm married. "Married" means you
sleep together, but you can't get none.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.658
Watch it with all that shit,
all right?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.621
- Where are your cup holders?
- I don't have one.

01:20.956 --> 01:25.001
What do you mean? $80,000
for this car and there's no cup holder?

01:25.377 --> 01:29.505
It's $105,000, and it's one of
the fastest production cars on Earth.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.340
0 to 60 in 4 seconds.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.469
- It's a limited edition.
- You damn right it's limited.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.512
No cup holder, no back seat.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.015
It's a shiny dick
with two chairs in it.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.185
I guess we the balls,
just dragging the fuck along.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.437
Damn.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.856
Sorry.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.196
Get it.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.491
I can't get down there.
You got an engineering flaw.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.409
My shit ain't going down
up in there.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.662
Go.
Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.873
Make them want it.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.958
I ain't cleaning up after you.

02:06.210 --> 02:10.128
My hand can't get down there.
When it does, it gets stuck.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.632
Now, what do you come up with?
You got this shit.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.008
Get that fry.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.052
This ain't Denny's.

02:16.887 --> 02:20.681
I wouldn't buy from Denny's.
I don't like how we been treated.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.142
They bit.
Let's gank these fools.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.230
You ain't interested in the fry.
You all up in that.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.565
- Get out.
- Shit.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.401
- What the fuck?
- We've had a big week.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.445
So get the fuck out of the car.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.365
Damn.
What you weigh, 350?

02:37.533 --> 02:40.326
I bet you're a Popeye chicken-eating
motherfucker, ain't you?

02:41.537 --> 02:43.996
Why I always get
the big, thick motherfuckers?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.456
Get out.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.083
All right. All right.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.960
Hold on.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.088
Funny. Let me tell you
how bad a day you're having.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.048
You're jacking a couple of cops.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.384
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm a stand-up comedian...

02:56.718 --> 02:59.220
...and I suck!
So I need your car.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.596
I ain't Wesley Snipes.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.600
I just hang out with stupid-ass friends
who drive stupid-ass cars...

03:04.852 --> 03:06.602
...that attract fucking attention.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.023
I need to jump over this car
and smack you in the head.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.193
- You're arguing over a fry.
- It's not about that.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.696
It's about your lack of respect
for people's property.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.614
- Hey, hey.
- Shut up!

03:18.866 --> 03:21.951
This is stupid.
Hold the fuck on.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.370
If you want some bad enough,
come get some.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.125
You like that shit?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.919
Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.088
Now get me a fucking Handi Wipe.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.924
Now let's hear one
of those jokes, bitch.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.605
What do you think?
Looks like the real thing.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.234
- Remember your assignment?
- Yeah, I'm a decoy.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.195
Yes, you are.

05:27.619 --> 05:28.869
What are you doing?

05:30.914 --> 05:34.333
Hello, police? I just saw
something terrible: a policeman shot...

05:34.584 --> 05:37.753
...at South Miami and 1 st Street.
Help, please.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.339
All units. Officer down.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.924
Respond code 3.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.140
All units respond and identify.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.785
This is Air 2.
We got a full perimeter.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.247
Officer down.
We need additional ground units.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.714
Air 3, roger.
Suspect or suspects unknown.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.471
Gentlemen, it's clear.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.130
We're inside.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.847
- We're in.
- You got 20 minutes.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.860
Goddamn tacos will kill me.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.544
Okay, we got 12 minutes.
Come on, let's go.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.771
Clear. We're in.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.675
Move your ass.
We got 6 minutes.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.886
Ready.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.934
Ready to fire.
Go.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.448
Fire.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.244
Go.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.385
Move!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.580
Damn.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.083
Did you have sweet dreams?

09:46.253 --> 09:48.254
You're so nasty.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.674
You always saying
you want quality time.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.262
Well, right now I got the time
and you damn sure got the quality.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.597
Come on now.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.808
You know what it is?

10:03.019 --> 10:06.438
I can't remember the last time
we fell asleep together.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.192
Baby...

10:11.945 --> 10:14.655
Baby, it's my job.
It's what it requires.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.117
I'm a better cop when
I get some in the morning.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.785
I feel lighter on my feet.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.122
Keep it in your pants.
I hear 3 little Burnetts coming.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.623
That's cold.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.917
You leave me here
like a humping dog.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.337
Hi, baby boy.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.465
- Daddy. Daddy.
- What's up?

10:39.389 --> 10:43.851
At school, people say I look weird.
They say my ears look funny.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.938
Your daddy has that same problem.
But you know what?

10:48.189 --> 10:50.524
They for you to listen
to people's problems.

10:50.734 --> 10:54.320
You're an angel. These are
your wings. Flap, flap. That's all.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.740
James, stop.
Would you take them off?

10:59.409 --> 11:02.745
Don't make me come to your school.
I'll arrest the principal.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.040
Talking about my boy's ears.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.753
- uncle Mike's in the house.
- What's up, uncle Mike?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.755
Partner, partner.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.967
- Check it out.
- What'd you take my food for?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.763
Don't. I don't know where
your lips were last night.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.102
- Did you have a date last night?
- Did I.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.104
Let me tell you.
This girl was...

11:30.273 --> 11:32.775
Don't tell my son
your sleazy sex stories.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.778
I only tell your husband
my sleazy sex stories.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.280
I don't want him knowing either.
It gives him ideas.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.950
Why put me in this?
I'm with my babies.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.410
Okay? Thank you.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.038
Eat. Go on.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.539
No problem.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.796
You're on the mike with Mike.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.968
Captain, I think you mean to say,
"Get our asses down there, please."

12:01.805 --> 12:02.888
Maybe not.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.316
Hey, baby.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.318
Where's Howard?

12:16.611 --> 12:19.571
Down there. He's looking for you.
He's been in better moods.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.034
Damn.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.578
Get it done, goddamn it.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.748
Welcome to our nightmare.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.501
See this?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.837
What's wrong with this picture?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.339
Remember this room?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.175
These flats look familiar?

12:40.468 --> 12:43.595
There were these silver packets
that looked like bricks.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.306
Little red tags on them,
about so high?

12:46.558 --> 12:49.017
All that heroin, gone.
- This was our career bust.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.477
One hundred million dollars.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.855
- Gone.
- This is bad.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.482
No, let me call it what it is:
this is fucked up.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.276
You got that right.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.194
Hello, Alison.

12:59.487 --> 13:03.198
You guys know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs' top watchdog.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.076
I'd take that as a compliment,
but I know you.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.122
If you two want to get personal,
I could step out...

13:10.457 --> 13:13.500
It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job.

13:13.710 --> 13:18.505
I love knowing that one leak can turn
this nightmare into a media frenzy.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.967
That won't happen.
We'll get the dope back before that.

13:22.218 --> 13:26.388
Good. Start by looking here because
this had to have been an inside job.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.223
I'll find out about it.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.393
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

13:33.897 --> 13:37.065
So they put this in for
toxic drug fumes?

13:37.901 --> 13:41.862
Yeah, this was a brilliant design.
This was really intelligent. I like this.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.740
I didn't ask how he feels.
What did he see?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.742
What does he know?

13:48.369 --> 13:49.745
Where were y'all last night?

13:50.038 --> 13:53.123
Have your cousins bring it back
and we can all get some sleep.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.084
We were going to,
but we came up with a problem.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.670
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.256
All right, you two, get over there.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.427
O'Fee is okay
but has nothing to tell us.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.264
So they kill a decoy,
it empties the station. Very smart.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.768
But they don't kill a real cop,
or the whole force would be on them.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.437
This was your case.
You're back on it.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.273
Sanchez, Ruiz, back them up
with whatever they need.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.359
Shut your mouths.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.112
But wait a second. It was Carrera's
drugs in the first place, right?

14:24.364 --> 14:27.533
It couldn't have been him, he was
killed in prison. What about his crew?

14:27.784 --> 14:30.202
Those idiots don't have
the precision to do this.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.746
But just in case I'm wrong,
check them out.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.959
Yeah, they would
have been up in here with Uzis.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.752
It takes brains do this.

14:38.962 --> 14:42.798
- Big cojones too.
- What are you talking about?

14:43.091 --> 14:45.801
It would take a month to explain
what cojones are.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.136
You in Miami.
You don't know cojones?

14:50.431 --> 14:54.142
We got nothing. What's the matter
with you? We've got nothing.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.979
The guy who pulled this off
knew what he was doing.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.565
He left us a big "Fuck you."

14:59.983 --> 15:01.233
Ruiz, Sanchez...

15:01.484 --> 15:04.486
...find out who installed
the ventilating system. Do that now.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.449
- That's cold.
- So's your mama's bed.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.327
This could definitely be an inside job.
Don't rule it out.

15:13.788 --> 15:17.249
The way I see it, we got 72 hours
before the FBI and DEA...

15:17.500 --> 15:19.126
...walk in and shut us down.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.669
We'll be the bad guys.

15:21.129 --> 15:25.299
The politics demand that somebody
take the rap for this, and it'll be us.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.177
Just do what you do.
Only faster.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.431
Jojo, you still a chemist, right?

15:32.682 --> 15:34.141
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

15:34.350 --> 15:38.228
I don't know about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.147
You know something.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.190
I just said "no" to drugs.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.319
He said "no" to drugs.
What you into, Jo?

15:45.528 --> 15:49.239
- Rubber. Check it out.
- You're selling tires, huh?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.618
You know nothing?
Jojo don't know nothing.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.036
I know tires.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.372
- You telling me the truth, right?
- Would I lie to you?

15:58.458 --> 15:59.499
Hey. You driving.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.884
This is a waste of time.

16:09.177 --> 16:13.972
I keep telling you, in Maxie's line
of work, she definitely gets the 411.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.684
Maxie. How'd I know
I was gonna find you up in here?

16:21.522 --> 16:24.024
We got to talk.
Is there some place we can go?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.776
Yeah, the equipment room.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.195
- Behave yourself.
- I'm cool.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.919
- Listen, I need some help. Again.
- So, what else is new?

16:55.515 --> 16:59.309
Some major ill shit
happened down at the P.D.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.312
There's lots of heroin
and cash involved.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.565
There'll be some jolly young men
who want to party.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.233
What do you need?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.736
Lots of people
will talk to you, not me.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.823
You mean customers?

17:13.031 --> 17:18.412
I'm not asking you to get into any wild
shit. Just call if you hear something.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.955
I think I will call you.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.633
What are you doing?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.635
Trying to keep my shit quick.

17:34.095 --> 17:38.140
Right, you ain't getting none at home.
You got extra energy. Burn it off.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.643
We got anything, Francine?

17:41.936 --> 17:45.272
Sanchez says the air conditioning
contract went to...

17:45.481 --> 17:47.357
...Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.486
He works out of his house this week.
That's the number.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.078
He's not answering.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.789
I guess we should leave.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.501
Make a trip all the way here
to high society for nothing?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.045
No. That's what they got windows for,
we can peek in.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.174
Yeah, that should be okay.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.096
- I tripped.
- The handle just opened?

18:18.347 --> 18:22.184
- Right after I tripped, it opened.
- They must want us to come in.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.769
Take a peek.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.646
Hello.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.024
We're your new neighbors.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.902
Don't be alarmed.
We're Negroes.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.821
No, man.
Too much bass in your voice.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.407
That scares white folks.
Sound like them.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.161
We were wondering if we can
borrow some brown sugar.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.629
- You fart?
- No, man.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.049
Dead guy.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.062
Looks like somebody's home.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.199
Let me take a stab at this one.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.077
He sells the ventilation plans
to the bad guys.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.497
- He gets rich, but dead.
- You're right on that.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.667
- I'm going to go call Homicide.
- Wait.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.919
Why do you act like this
around corpses?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.463
It's cool. I just...

19:34.340 --> 19:35.757
Please? Look around.

19:37.426 --> 19:41.596
The smell and the...
It's just unexpected, that's all.

19:51.399 --> 19:54.109
It's looks like our buddy Arrona
was a gambler.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.027
Got dog track, jai alai...

19:56.279 --> 19:59.447
- Probably needed money to pay debts.
- Bookie.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.703
Damn, man.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.621
Watch where you swing
the dead leg.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.248
My bad, my bad.

20:08.499 --> 20:11.001
Damn this.
I'm calling Homicide.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.003
I'm a narcotics cop.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.049
Dead bodies...

20:20.386 --> 20:21.636
...dead ends.

20:27.894 --> 20:28.977
Maggots.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.025
What's wrong with you, man?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.790
Hey, want to grab
a couple of burritos?

20:53.419 --> 20:56.963
You drive almost slow enough
to drive Miss Daisy.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.093
Man, the transaction is done.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.512
We ain't got shit, so it's over.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.182
Relax. We got it before,
we'll get it again.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.809
You got it all figured out, don't you?

21:10.061 --> 21:11.645
You got to have faith.

21:11.854 --> 21:15.273
By the time we figured out how,
we'd be out of a job.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.819
Scratch that. Everybody in
the damn unit will be out of a job.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.696
But don't worry.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.866
They tend to think
Mike Lowrey going to be all right.

21:25.159 --> 21:29.204
Especially since they think
you some rich kid playing cop.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.624
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.086
See, for me, no job, no check.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.797
That's like all the other guys
in the unit.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.215
At least, most of us.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.717
So I'm playing cop now?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.887
This is a game?
I'm just joking?

21:46.180 --> 21:49.015
You always wanting to be
Starsky or Hutch.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.560
You know what?

21:52.812 --> 21:55.230
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.984
I'm supposed to apologize
for my family leaving me money?

21:59.235 --> 22:01.695
All I ever wanted to be was a cop.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.239
I get up early
and I take it to the max every day.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.575
I'm the first guy through the door
and the last to leave a crime scene.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.036
So fuck you. And fuck them.

22:10.246 --> 22:13.623
And fuck anybody who got
a problem with Mike Lowrey.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.169
- I love you, man.
- Fuck you, Marcus.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.382
I do.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.050
You're cool, man.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.636
- You're my partner.
- Shut up.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.138
Slow-ass driver.

22:28.389 --> 22:31.141
- Driving like a bitch.
- Why I got to be all that?

22:31.392 --> 22:32.434
Slow-ass.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.854
I'll take us off this cliff,
keep fucking with me.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.274
Then it would be, what,
two bitches in the sea?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.901
- Is that what you want?
- Shut up.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.446
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.574
I'm a bad boy.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.453
Bad boys, bad boys
What you gonna do?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.289
What you gonna do
When they come for you?

22:54.582 --> 22:56.624
Only models and that's all.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.711
Max just dropped by.
I got to go. Bye.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.258
You want me to call around
looking for the newly rich?

23:05.468 --> 23:09.304
Are there any new guys partying a lot,
spending lots of money?

23:09.597 --> 23:11.765
This guy called me
this morning, desperate...

23:11.974 --> 23:15.310
...looking for new girls in town.
Are you available?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.270
It'll be a quick $2000.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.646
I got plans with Julie.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.815
- She's your roommate, right?
- Yeah.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.276
So bring her.
She's cute, she's sexy.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.988
- She's not a working girl, Lois.
- Doesn't matter. He's on speedballs.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.449
He probably so messed up
he can't even get it up.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.618
All right, maybe we'll go check it out.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.079
Could be the party I'm looking for.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.665
A party at the Biltmore.
That'll really rock.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.334
I owe you one.

23:39.794 --> 23:43.463
Forget about it. I'll just deduct it from
the hundreds of favors I owe you.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.216
Am I becoming a guest
who won't leave?

23:46.467 --> 23:48.635
No, I like having you live with me.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.930
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who doesn't know how to cook.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.516
Not a big upside for you there.

23:54.809 --> 23:58.686
What hip individual inspired
this visit to the Biltmore?

23:58.854 --> 24:00.188
It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.

24:00.356 --> 24:04.150
Oh, right. The cop I think you're
a little bit in love with.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.862
Maybe I am.
But we're just friends.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.324
If I were in trouble,
he's the only person I'd call.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.452
I know, I know.
I think I've heard this before.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.042
You must be Max. Welcome.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.877
I'm Eddie.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.338
To the Al Capone suite.

24:25.548 --> 24:28.466
So I guess we're a little early.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.053
- This is my friend Julie.
- Julie.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.265
You like Al Capone, don't you?

24:36.350 --> 24:38.143
I hadn't thought about it much.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.564
I'm not kidding
about this being Capone's.

24:42.857 --> 24:46.776
He had the place
rigged with secret passageways.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.571
- 10 minutes, we're out of here.
- Five.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.738
One drink.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.075
- One sip.
- Hey, what's the whispering about?

24:54.702 --> 24:56.077
Just girl chat.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.912
Where's the bathroom?

24:58.747 --> 25:00.498
upstairs on your right.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.209
Watch your step.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.004
Come.

25:06.797 --> 25:07.881
Sit.

25:08.591 --> 25:10.758
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.345
Eddie's got some favors
to play with.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.930
Yes, that he does.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.892
I should've told you sooner
about Eddie's private party.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.103
Well, now it's a surprise party.

25:29.111 --> 25:33.072
Okay, Max, I think we've been here
about 5 minutes too long.

25:38.621 --> 25:41.539
I see you treat yourself well, Eddie.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.631
I needed to blow off
a little steam after...

25:49.965 --> 25:51.925
...the move, you know.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.886
So a little party with
a few friends, that's all.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.972
I was going to invite you guys.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.557
Invite?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.976
Looks like I'm catering this.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.398
I was looking for my 2 keys of dope.
Now I know where they are.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.901
Yours? It's our score.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.447
- And the girl?
- Nobody.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.783
Just entertainment.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.119
- I'm Max.
- Nice to meet you, Max.

26:22.248 --> 26:26.167
I like a woman who
takes pride in her appearance.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.629
Don't you?

26:30.839 --> 26:33.466
I hate when
a bitch lets herself slide.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.930
You look like a model in that dress.
Will you model for me?

26:46.605 --> 26:49.190
Oh, great.
It's the goon squad.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.304
You were a cop.
You should know hookers talk.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.432
You couldn't wait 4 more days
until I made the deal?

27:22.683 --> 27:26.144
- I can't work with that kind of stupidity!
- Stupidity?

27:26.562 --> 27:28.813
I got you connected inside.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.400
I brought you my family.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.031
It's my family now.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.075
We're still friends.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.953
- What're you guys doing?
- You pissed him off.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.833
Jesus, you got blood on me again.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.336
Someone's up there. upstairs.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.840
Get her. Move!

28:01.221 --> 28:02.263
Get her!

28:12.775 --> 28:14.025
What the fuck?

28:33.087 --> 28:34.629
Shoot her!

28:52.439 --> 28:53.648
- I got her.
- I got her.

28:53.899 --> 28:57.318
- Bullshit, I got her.
- What do you know about shooting?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.320
I can't believe she made it.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.489
- Jesus.
- Are you serious?

29:01.740 --> 29:04.325
- She jumped.
- Fuck.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.830
Find out who she worked for,
and find out where she lives.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.842
It's about fucking time.

29:22.636 --> 29:26.055
Come here, look at this.
See this guy?

29:26.557 --> 29:27.765
He's dead, right?

29:28.016 --> 29:30.184
- Look familiar?
- Eddie Dominguez.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.353
- The ex-cop.
- Two points for you.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.856
And there's some
of our high-grade heroin over there.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.817
That's a headline Sinclair will love.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.861
No sign of forced entry.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.363
What the fuck is all this?
Looks like Beirut.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.198
It's the Al Capone suite.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.617
What can I say? Shit happens.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.036
It's a shitty day.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.496
Real shitty day.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.875
Looks like we've got two shades
of lipstick over here.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.877
Someone's missing from the party.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.670
Listen to me.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.591
Your only function in life now
is to find that person.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.010
It's the only good lead
we got all day.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.804
I'll check all calls to the room.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.734
What you got over there?

30:30.913 --> 30:32.330
Cover her.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.543
He knew the girl?

30:50.432 --> 30:51.933
Look, man.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.353
We'll get the witness
and get the fools who did this.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.606
See if you can
catch a ride with Howard.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.899
Where you going?

31:01.026 --> 31:04.570
Checking calls made to Lois Fields.
Maxie worked for her.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.949
- I'll come with you.
- No, we'll catch up later.

31:08.909 --> 31:09.951
You okay?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.370
I'm cool.

31:20.462 --> 31:21.754
Hello?

31:28.387 --> 31:29.470
Shit.

31:33.809 --> 31:38.104
Look, baby, I know
quality time was my idea.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.482
- Don't talk to me about quality time.
- Hold on, babe.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.152
I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.487
Just a minute.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.614
I got on the red one.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.285
The red one? With the snaps?
Couldn't you wait?

31:52.494 --> 31:53.828
You're never home.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.080
All his files are blocked.

31:56.331 --> 32:00.585
I don't care about his personal files.
He's dead. unblock it.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.336
Screw you, that's illegal.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.088
No, screw you.

32:06.008 --> 32:09.302
- Are you talking to me?
- No, I'm not talking to...

32:09.469 --> 32:12.680
No, it's a term you use.
"Screw you" is a cop term.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.724
You ain't screwing nothing.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.601
Goddamn it.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.480
Where's Lowrey?

32:22.232 --> 32:23.858
I just paged him.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.444
He's following up
this Lois Fields lead.

32:26.695 --> 32:27.737
The madam?

32:43.253 --> 32:46.130
21-2 Requesting backup.
614 Reach Road.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.500
That might be him.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.213
Yeah, Lowrey's desk.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.091
I need to talk
to Detective Mike Lowrey.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.051
This is Captain Howard.
Can I help you?

33:32.302 --> 33:34.762
You can get me Detective Lowrey.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.014
Is this another paternity case?

33:37.516 --> 33:40.101
No, it's another murder case,
you twerp.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.938
You're not talking about the murder
case at the Biltmore tonight, are you?

33:44.606 --> 33:47.108
I've just seen my best friend
murdered.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.444
I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.613
Why only Mike Lowrey?
I have a detective here...

33:52.948 --> 33:57.201
None of your fucking business.
I talk to Lowrey or I blow town.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.079
Mike, phone. Telephone.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.957
He's coming right now.
Hold on, please.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.418
- Talk to her.
- I ain't got time for these games.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.045
This is the witness from the hotel.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.632
He just got out of the john.
Hold on.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.802
- Talk to her now or she'll walk.
- I can't be Mike.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.469
She's going to walk out.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.806
- This is our witness.
- Calm down.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.353
Hello.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.313
This is Lowrey.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.818
He doesn't talk that way.
Talk like him.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.112
Try to talk sexy.
You don't sound sexy enough.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.156
Captain.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.489
Damn.

34:38.784 --> 34:42.079
You don't know me.
My name's Julie Mott.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.498
I was Max Logan's best friend.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.667
Calm down, calm down.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.502
Talk to me now.

34:51.882 --> 34:55.176
She said if she ever needed
anything...

34:57.512 --> 34:59.138
I need your help.

34:59.473 --> 35:00.848
Give me the address.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.600
All right.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.311
It'll be okay.
Mike's to the rescue.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.021
I'm on the way.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.023
- I'll find Lowrey.
- I can't go.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.483
You got to go.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.985
Get Mike to handle this.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.404
Get to this address now.
Get up.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.532
You won't see your wife for a month!
Get out of the chair!

35:31.713 --> 35:33.464
Get this fucking door fixed.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.640
Mike Lowrey.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.643
No, easy.
Mike Lowrey.

35:48.230 --> 35:49.230
Shit.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.524
Who's there?

35:52.818 --> 35:54.652
Mike Lowrey.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.821
How do I know it's Lowrey?

35:57.072 --> 35:59.323
Because, I'm Mike Lowrey.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.325
We ain't got much time.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.828
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.705
I won't let you in until you do.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.382
No way.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.719
- What was that for?
- You're not Mike Lowrey.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.514
What do you mean?
You've never met him.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.058
- Max described you differently.
- I'm undercover.

36:27.686 --> 36:30.604
- Prove it.
- I know Max from way back.

36:30.772 --> 36:34.024
- I helped her brother get out ofjail.
- So?

36:34.276 --> 36:38.487
From time to time we got together
to bump and grind...

36:38.738 --> 36:39.947
Wrong.

36:41.241 --> 36:42.992
Give me the bat.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.619
Fine.
You don't want to believe me?

36:46.246 --> 36:47.788
You go at this shit alone.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.376
I forgot.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.087
The bad guys probably
know where you live...

36:55.255 --> 36:57.631
...and are coming for your ass.
Good luck.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.760
I saw the whole thing.

37:02.929 --> 37:06.390
I watched him shoot her
like she was nothing.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.604
Please, shut the door.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.234
Look, lady.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.529
You ain't got
no more bats, golf clubs...

37:20.780 --> 37:23.824
...or anything like that
to swing at me, do you?

37:25.285 --> 37:26.827
I knew Max, okay?

37:27.412 --> 37:30.164
I cared about Max also.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.126
I'm just here to help you.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.422
You're not what I expected.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.927
I ain't expect to walk
into Yankee Stadium either.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.933
We got to get out of here, okay?
Let's go.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.518
I've got to get my dogs.
Dukie.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.521
Lukie, Dukie, whatever.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.815
You got a back door?

37:57.067 --> 38:00.069
- Where we going?
- Protective custody.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.988
Fuck that.
I'm only dealing with you.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.866
That was a cop that threw
that party at the Biltmore.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.869
Former cop.
We got rid of him long ago.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.204
Come on, Luke.

38:10.538 --> 38:14.458
Listen, if you want to live,
you got to trust me.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.062
Run! Run! Move!

38:47.325 --> 38:49.910
Here, doggie.
Come on, doggie.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.537
Jesus Christ!

38:51.997 --> 38:53.038
Who the hell was that?

38:53.999 --> 38:56.875
There is too much killing going on!

38:57.252 --> 38:58.502
Go after them!

38:58.753 --> 38:59.837
I'll go around front!

39:02.549 --> 39:05.718
Come on, move your ass. Let's go.

39:09.431 --> 39:10.514
Fuck.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.444
Get in the car.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.738
Damn.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.202
- Go, goddamn it.
- Fucking door.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.913
Go, goddamn it, go.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.090
How did you miss them?
You fat fuck!

39:45.300 --> 39:46.800
Watch your fucking mouth!

39:47.052 --> 39:48.719
Lose weight, you'd have caught them.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.555
I'd like to squeeze your fucking head.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.640
Now you're in fucking trouble.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.101
- You get the license plate?
- I got the plates.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.770
You cockeyed fuck.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.774
This is a getaway car?
We won't get away from anything.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.276
Is this a goddamn
family station wagon?

40:04.569 --> 40:07.488
Oh, my God,
you got a baby seat in the back.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.324
It's an undercover car, okay?

40:10.909 --> 40:14.995
I know they saw my license plate.
Were those the guys who shot Max?

40:15.288 --> 40:18.499
I only saw bullets.
You tell me what they look like.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.418
I don't know. I was busy trying
to keep a bullet out of you.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.005
I need you to look
through some mug shots...

40:25.298 --> 40:27.174
...to identity Max's shooter.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.218
- Where?
- Protective custody.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.346
I told you I'm not going
into protective custody.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.806
I'm not playing.

40:34.015 --> 40:37.434
You really pissing me off.
I'll book your ass.

40:37.727 --> 40:42.231
Oh, yeah? I'll develop amnesia.
I suddenly feel a case of it coming on.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.192
Fine, where would you feel safe?

40:45.443 --> 40:47.653
You want to do protective custody?

40:47.821 --> 40:52.366
We'll do in-home protective custody,
at your place. I can handle that.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.035
Yeah, my place.
My place is...

40:55.328 --> 40:56.662
No way.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.498
Right.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.960
Yeah, my place is the shit.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.629
Mike Lowrey's place.
You right.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.258
That's the best idea you came up
with tonight. Yeah, my place.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.806
Wait here.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.563
Detective Burnett.

41:22.772 --> 41:26.024
How are you? Long time no see.
Mr. Lowrey's not here.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.402
He said I could use his place.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.654
He didn't mention it to me.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.034
Who's the chick?
How's your wife?

41:38.037 --> 41:39.413
Fine, she's fine.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.583
Your kids, they're good?
Family's the most important thing.

41:43.084 --> 41:44.084
Is it?

41:44.377 --> 41:47.754
Mr. Lowrey said you got a baby factory
going on at your house. True?

41:48.381 --> 41:50.841
Here you go.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.594
If that ain't enough,
I'll run you in for extortion.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.013
You know,
I'm so stupid sometimes.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.264
Are you?

41:57.432 --> 42:00.517
Now that you mention it,
Mr. Lowrey mentioned you'd come by.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.562
What did he say?
Did he say he had a key?

42:03.730 --> 42:04.771
Hang out.

42:06.107 --> 42:07.316
- Here.
- Is this it?

42:07.567 --> 42:08.692
You're hurting me.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.904
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.449
- Have fun.
- It's not like that.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.327
- Sure, sure.
- It's not like that.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.416
Come on.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.960
Watch your step up through here.

42:27.337 --> 42:29.630
Damn, I must've left
some incense burning.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.758
Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.

42:34.469 --> 42:36.053
This is kind of...

42:36.930 --> 42:38.305
I'm always moving my switches.

42:38.473 --> 42:41.475
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.435
Damn.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.270
Shit.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.982
Why am I tripping on shit
I know is there?

42:51.736 --> 42:53.070
You found a light switch.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.448
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

42:57.951 --> 42:59.576
Mike, this is Yvette.

42:59.869 --> 43:02.788
Ignore this.
It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

43:03.122 --> 43:05.123
She's always calling,
got to have it.

43:05.667 --> 43:08.293
Don't call here no more now, freak.
Just one of my freaks.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.963
All this on a cop's salary?

43:11.673 --> 43:13.173
Well...

43:13.675 --> 43:14.758
...it's honest money.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.177
I'm a second-generation rich kid.

43:18.096 --> 43:22.099
If you're not in it for the paycheck,
are you an action junkie?

43:23.059 --> 43:24.518
If that what you want to call it.

43:24.936 --> 43:28.689
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets grazing my ass.

43:28.982 --> 43:30.691
Gives me a rush.

43:31.276 --> 43:34.444
Look, I'll give you a broad stroke
of the place.

43:34.946 --> 43:37.948
I got some T-bones in the fridge
for Lukie and Dukie...

43:38.157 --> 43:43.203
Sorry, the fridge is this way.
I confuse my own shit.

43:43.788 --> 43:49.042
- Wait, you're leaving me here alone?
- Yeah, I gotta get back to the P.D.

43:49.502 --> 43:52.713
These are Miami's
peak crime hours, you know.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.214
Apparently.

43:55.550 --> 43:59.928
They said this deal was going down
in 4 days, and I, you know...

44:00.179 --> 44:05.392
...obviously seem to be kind of
a major glitch in their...

44:05.560 --> 44:08.729
You ain't with the bad guys now.
You're with the cops.

44:09.230 --> 44:11.565
With Mike Lowrey. You with the cops.

44:11.858 --> 44:14.234
Everything will be all right.
Trust me.

44:14.861 --> 44:16.486
I'll be back.

44:16.738 --> 44:21.033
I know that it's no time to joke,
but remember in the movie when...?

44:21.326 --> 44:23.452
All right, all right.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.246
Thanks for everything, Mike.

44:27.915 --> 44:29.207
I'm going.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.673
- Chet.
- You're one of those in and out guys.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.425
It's not like that, Chet.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.719
- The girl, she's a witness.
- Right.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.721
- Keep an eye out.
- No problem.

44:42.972 --> 44:44.598
Listen to me. Hear me.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.266
- Me?
- That's right.

44:46.559 --> 44:51.104
All right, the moment Lowrey gets in,
you have him call me at home.

44:51.773 --> 44:53.106
- At my home.
- Call you at home.

44:53.274 --> 44:55.108
use this phone.
Don't let him go upstairs.

44:55.276 --> 44:59.571
But he lives here. I don't wanna argue
with Mr. Lowrey. I could lose my job.

44:59.781 --> 45:03.116
- Chet, trust me on this, okay?
- Okay. Call you from here.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.785
Don't let him up.

45:05.078 --> 45:06.578
- No problem.
- Important witness.

45:06.871 --> 45:07.913
Thank you.

45:08.122 --> 45:11.708
I got an idea. I'm off in 2 hours,
I could go upstairs...

45:11.959 --> 45:13.043
...and watch the door.

45:13.294 --> 45:15.253
Like cops do in the movies.
Sit on the stool.

45:15.505 --> 45:19.424
I got a magazine and everything.
And I don't let anybody in or out.

45:19.634 --> 45:22.135
All kidding aside, I want to help.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.304
You're helping.
Do that from here.

45:24.514 --> 45:27.265
- Can you do it from here?
- Yes, I can do it from here.

45:27.809 --> 45:30.310
Fine.
That helps. From here, okay?

45:30.645 --> 45:34.064
It's funny that you ask me,
because I was going to be a cop.

45:34.315 --> 45:37.818
I took the test and everything.
Just didn't work out.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.069
Politics.

45:40.113 --> 45:42.322
- I know, you're my deputy.
- I'm your deputy.

45:42.490 --> 45:45.659
- From here. Watch out for everything.
- You got it.

45:46.119 --> 45:47.786
Take care, chief.

45:48.413 --> 45:49.454
I'm a deputy.

45:49.664 --> 45:52.833
Don't "honey-baby" me,
you smell like perfume.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.171
And you don't even have
your wedding ring on.

46:00.133 --> 46:01.341
Damn.

46:02.552 --> 46:04.177
I went undercover...

46:04.345 --> 46:08.140
...and so it required
taking off the ring for a second.

46:08.307 --> 46:12.144
But I got the ring. Look, I just put
my hand in my pocket to get it...

46:12.353 --> 46:13.979
...and it's right back on.

46:15.857 --> 46:17.065
Damn.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.484
Can I get a pillow?

46:19.777 --> 46:23.530
Well, if it isn't the guy
who doesn't return phone calls.

46:23.781 --> 46:26.366
Mind telling me where you've been
the last 12 hours?

46:26.617 --> 46:28.118
I paged you all night.

46:28.369 --> 46:31.121
We got a situation here
that you need to know about.

46:31.330 --> 46:32.622
Look, Marcus...

46:32.874 --> 46:36.543
...I got a dead madam, a concussion
and a bad headache.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.379
Let me tell you what I did last night.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.967
I had to sleep on my couch. I woke up
with a Power Ranger in my ass.

46:44.218 --> 46:47.888
While we're discussing my ass,
I damn near got it blown off.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.974
The good news is I got a witness.

46:51.225 --> 46:54.102
Let me tell you about her.
She likes to...

46:54.812 --> 46:57.230
You sound like a nagging wife.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.107
I'm a nagging...?

46:59.358 --> 47:02.569
See what happens when you go off
without me? You get into shit.

47:02.737 --> 47:05.655
Oh, please, like shit don't happen
when you're there.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.657
That ain't the point.

47:07.909 --> 47:12.120
If your partner pages you, you might
wanna get back to your partner.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.748
I want to meet the man
who whupped your ass.

47:15.041 --> 47:18.001
I want to meet
who whupped Shaft's ass.

47:18.252 --> 47:21.630
Look at me. You don't know
what I've been through.

47:21.881 --> 47:25.258
My wife kicked me out
of my happy home.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.844
But, no.
You got to go off by yourself.

47:28.095 --> 47:32.265
"I got this, partner, I got this."
Bullshit.

47:32.517 --> 47:34.768
I am feeling much better though.
Thank you.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.186
I'll get him.

47:37.230 --> 47:40.732
- I'll beat you up.
- Watch yourself.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.652
What did I say?
Did you hear what I said?

47:43.903 --> 47:46.613
I heard what I said
because I was there when I said it.

47:47.281 --> 47:50.784
I told you.
I told you to secure a witness...

47:51.077 --> 47:52.911
...not shoot up a neighborhood.

47:53.162 --> 47:57.374
Not to do another dead body.
Just get the dope back, quietly.

47:57.917 --> 48:01.461
Look, captain. This whole situation
is getting out of control.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.381
You're damn right
it's getting out of control!

48:04.549 --> 48:07.968
I damn near had to pass a pop quiz
before she believed I was him.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.720
Going, it's going...

48:10.972 --> 48:12.806
Shit, little off.

48:13.432 --> 48:16.268
I haven't killed
anybody yet today, captain.

48:16.477 --> 48:20.313
You want me to yell at you? Because
I can do that. Listen, this witness...

48:20.815 --> 48:23.483
...it's the only good news I got,
okay?

48:23.693 --> 48:25.318
You guys are bad news.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.738
What does that mean?
It means if you must be Mike Lowrey...

48:28.990 --> 48:32.325
...Santa Claus, I don't give a shit,
that's who you'll be.

48:32.577 --> 48:35.161
Wait a minute,
what the hell is going on?

48:37.832 --> 48:40.083
I was getting them all in
before you came.

48:40.334 --> 48:43.336
Can somebody talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?

48:44.422 --> 48:48.174
Captain, these fools
could have seen my license plate.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.594
So where's the girl now?

48:52.471 --> 48:54.347
- His place.
- What?

48:54.640 --> 48:58.143
You left her by herself?
Our only fucking witness?

48:58.352 --> 49:00.437
You left a strange hooker
in my apartment?

49:00.688 --> 49:04.149
The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know.

49:04.358 --> 49:08.486
I had to stash her somewhere.
Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

49:09.030 --> 49:12.657
You left dogs in my house? There's
dogs and a hooker in my house?

49:12.950 --> 49:15.368
Add some chimps,
we'll have a carnival.

49:15.620 --> 49:17.120
She's not a hooker.

49:17.371 --> 49:19.289
- Can you please...?
- Shut up!

49:21.334 --> 49:24.294
For years, Sinclair has tried
to pin something on me.

49:24.545 --> 49:27.047
I'm always taking it for you.
Do it for me.

49:30.509 --> 49:35.180
If this witness IDs the shooters,
maybe we catch our bad guys.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.265
But until then...

49:37.516 --> 49:38.767
...until then...

49:39.018 --> 49:40.268
...you are Mike Lowrey.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.562
You be him,
that's what you are.

49:42.813 --> 49:46.483
You're him. I don't want to hear it.
And you. You be you.

49:46.734 --> 49:49.903
But not in front of her.
You're him, you're you.

49:55.493 --> 49:58.912
Can we get a time-out?
Am I the designated homeless?

49:59.538 --> 50:03.750
Does it look like I care?
Whatever it takes, all right?

50:03.918 --> 50:05.001
What did she say to you?

50:05.294 --> 50:08.797
The shooters will make their drop
in 4 days? So we got 4 days.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.425
Captain, what kind of plan is that?

50:12.677 --> 50:14.594
I can't be shacked up
with that woman.

50:14.887 --> 50:18.306
I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass.

50:19.058 --> 50:21.685
You don't like your job, quit.

50:23.771 --> 50:24.938
Damn.

50:26.899 --> 50:29.401
I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids.

50:29.694 --> 50:34.197
Thanks, but no thanks. You won't
last 5 minutes with my family.

50:34.532 --> 50:38.326
Please. Married life is easy.
You only got one woman to satisty.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.913
Yo, man...

50:42.123 --> 50:43.456
...we ain't the Cosbys.

50:44.125 --> 50:46.126
Let's go, I got this.

50:46.377 --> 50:47.419
Go.

50:49.964 --> 50:52.424
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

50:52.633 --> 50:55.468
You're going to be retired
like him too.

50:55.928 --> 50:58.263
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

50:59.140 --> 51:02.434
Cleveland? I have never...

51:02.601 --> 51:05.103
Look, woman, I done told you...

51:05.354 --> 51:07.063
...it's a federal subpoena.

51:07.273 --> 51:11.234
- Am I going to tell them no?
- I don't know. Why can't he go?

51:11.485 --> 51:12.777
Why can't you go?

51:12.987 --> 51:16.906
I wanted to, but Captain Howard said
I'm irresponsi...

51:17.158 --> 51:20.910
No, he said, "loose cannon."
Because I be shooting in public.

51:21.162 --> 51:22.370
Out of nowhere sometimes.

51:22.621 --> 51:23.997
Mike. No, man.

51:24.457 --> 51:25.999
Please. All right.

51:27.793 --> 51:30.920
Look. The neighborhood
has lots of break-ins.

51:31.172 --> 51:32.839
I can handle it. I don't need Mike.

51:33.090 --> 51:37.844
I know, but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here.

51:38.012 --> 51:40.889
Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back.

51:41.140 --> 51:44.642
Who'll pick up the kids from day care?
Mike can't do it.

51:44.894 --> 51:47.395
Are you listening to me?

51:47.646 --> 51:51.441
I read a book
that could probably help y'all.

51:51.609 --> 51:54.277
Mike, please, man.
Can you go down and have a Coke?

51:54.528 --> 51:56.946
- Please.
- All right.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.658
Y'all want something?

52:01.452 --> 52:04.913
- Bring me a Coke. Baby, want a Coke?
- I'm fine, thank you.

52:06.707 --> 52:08.291
All right.

52:13.297 --> 52:17.675
So explain it to me. We've got
a problem with our chemistry set?

52:17.927 --> 52:19.427
It's not a chemistry set.

52:20.012 --> 52:22.347
He knows it ain't
a chemistry set, asshole.

52:27.228 --> 52:28.436
So what is it?

52:28.687 --> 52:31.439
The cutting agent
is a highly volatile...

52:31.816 --> 52:32.857
...substance.

52:33.359 --> 52:34.734
- I don't care.
- The ether...

52:35.027 --> 52:36.736
I don't care. I don't care.

52:37.029 --> 52:40.240
I'm not a fucking
chemistry teacher, Elliot.

52:40.699 --> 52:41.950
What is the problem?

52:42.201 --> 52:45.036
The problem is there's
too much moisture down here.

52:45.246 --> 52:48.039
- Yeah, it's totally fucked.
- Shut up!

52:49.083 --> 52:50.166
Okay.

52:50.376 --> 52:51.501
What else?

52:51.752 --> 52:54.420
It's taking longer to cook
than we planned.

52:54.588 --> 52:57.549
If we rush it, we'll have lots of drugs
that we can't sell.

52:57.925 --> 53:02.053
You're fucking with my timetable.
I gave you a deadline. understand?

53:02.263 --> 53:05.014
- Do you understand?
- I do.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.852
Julie.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.895
Yeah.

53:14.108 --> 53:15.775
- Hi.
- You dressed?

53:15.985 --> 53:18.570
Yeah, I am.

53:19.113 --> 53:23.783
We must go through some mug shots.
I'll hook into the computer.

53:24.034 --> 53:27.120
- And we can do this.
- Who's that guy in the photos?

53:29.915 --> 53:34.294
Sometimes I don't look at my shelf
and forget all those pictures was here.

53:34.587 --> 53:38.506
That's my partner. That's my partner,
Marcus Burnett.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.926
I've never seen anything
like this before.

53:42.136 --> 53:44.929
I see how it may throw you
a little bit.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.639
It's a cop thing.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.809
These pictures are here for
each time he saved my life.

53:50.102 --> 53:54.814
It's the same with him. You go to his
place, ain't nothing but pictures of me.

53:54.982 --> 53:57.317
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

53:58.819 --> 54:03.656
When I saw it, the whole wall,
I thought maybe they were...

54:04.241 --> 54:05.450
...pictures of your lover.

54:06.327 --> 54:07.327
Who?

54:07.620 --> 54:09.245
I thought you were gay.

54:10.623 --> 54:11.664
Gay?

54:12.416 --> 54:13.458
Nah, nah, nah.

54:15.044 --> 54:19.047
I didn't mean to offend you.
It's okay to be a homosexual.

54:19.298 --> 54:23.092
No, you're not listening.
It's not registering.

54:23.344 --> 54:27.555
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?
You didn't feel the dents?

54:27.806 --> 54:29.432
The dents come from that.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.602
- That's how I gets down.
- That's...

54:32.770 --> 54:33.811
...sweet.

54:34.313 --> 54:38.191
I'm gay. If I was, I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker.

54:40.194 --> 54:41.194
No.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.618
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

54:48.869 --> 54:50.662
I don't eat flesh.

54:51.330 --> 54:52.372
What?

54:52.957 --> 54:54.874
That's flesh that you're...

54:55.167 --> 54:56.626
...shoveling in your mouth.

54:56.877 --> 55:01.714
That was a living, breathing creature.
It probably had a name.

55:04.009 --> 55:05.468
It's just bologna.

55:05.719 --> 55:07.720
My bologna has a first name.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.890
Actually, your bologna has
about 30 names...

55:11.183 --> 55:14.727
...because they take odd parts
from all different ones.

55:14.979 --> 55:18.898
The leftovers: the hooves,
stomach lining, ears...

55:19.191 --> 55:24.195
...and stuff. They put it into
a machine and grind it up.

55:25.489 --> 55:30.118
Then out comes, like, this sheet.
That's what you're eating now.

55:33.622 --> 55:34.706
You know what?

55:34.873 --> 55:37.834
I don't eat bologna no more.
How about a pickle?

55:38.252 --> 55:42.588
- Can I eat the pickle?
- There's lots of salt, but it's fine.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.090
Salt in the pickle?

55:44.341 --> 55:49.095
Let me rinse... Let me rinse it off.
There we go.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.765
How's that?

55:53.100 --> 55:55.268
Just... Let's keep going.

55:55.561 --> 55:57.020
I don't taste salt now.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.150
Go back.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.116
That's the guy.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.410
He was there, in the room.

56:12.703 --> 56:16.956
We got a tip they was running
major druggage, like 50 keys.

56:17.249 --> 56:18.958
So we steps to the door.

56:19.209 --> 56:21.961
"Freeze! Miami P.D.!
Get down, get down, get down!"

56:22.463 --> 56:26.924
Out of nowhere, this pimp named
Chino punched me in the head.

56:27.176 --> 56:29.802
Chino's running hos,
but your dad will explain that.

56:30.095 --> 56:35.433
Look at it. Your dogs shit
all over my place. Liquid shit.

56:35.684 --> 56:39.687
It doesn't help, shellacking it in
with furniture polish.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.981
There's a piece there.
Get it.

56:42.232 --> 56:44.567
- I got it.
- Look like a chip of shit.

56:47.154 --> 56:49.906
Can I please have the parole jacket
on Noah Trafficante?

56:50.157 --> 56:51.824
- Thank you.
- You know what?

56:52.076 --> 56:53.910
I'm tired of this witness.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.829
I want my life the way it was.

56:57.122 --> 57:00.291
I'm tired.
I got married so I could stop lying.

57:00.501 --> 57:02.502
I can't believe you're complaining.

57:02.795 --> 57:06.506
You got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo you call home.

57:07.341 --> 57:09.008
Why you call my place a zoo?

57:09.259 --> 57:11.636
- I'm tired of you.
- You want to fight?

57:11.845 --> 57:14.180
Listen, Francine, please...

57:16.934 --> 57:19.143
That's my silk shirt, man.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.479
It's nice.

57:21.730 --> 57:25.525
I figure since I'm gonna be like Mike,
I might as well dress like Mike.

57:26.360 --> 57:29.946
I wanna be
I wanna be like Mike

57:31.365 --> 57:33.866
You're sick.
Something's wrong with you.

57:34.118 --> 57:37.036
You have a problem
that should be checked.

57:37.287 --> 57:38.371
Probably.

57:39.456 --> 57:42.333
- Here's the file. Worked at Club Hell.
- Thank you.

57:42.793 --> 57:46.045
Can you take care of this?
I gotta call the wife.

57:47.214 --> 57:50.216
- Whose wife?
- Can you please do some work?

57:50.467 --> 57:52.844
- Once today, just do something.
- I tell you...

57:53.053 --> 57:54.887
Do something to help this case.

57:55.139 --> 57:56.180
Boy.

57:56.390 --> 57:58.349
You look handsome today.

57:58.559 --> 58:02.895
No, see, it's not that kind of day.
Leave me the fuck alone.

58:03.188 --> 58:04.230
Seriously.

58:05.023 --> 58:06.232
What's up, babe, PMS?

58:06.483 --> 58:07.859
Damn the jokes.

58:08.068 --> 58:11.279
- Damn them. Ring it.
- Okay, I won't say anything.

58:11.530 --> 58:14.073
Yeah, that's cool. Hold on.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.076
Go ahead.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.330
All right.

58:22.082 --> 58:26.085
- How are things going with the kids?
- They're fine. You okay?

58:26.253 --> 58:30.173
- How's potty training going?
- Slowly, but surely.

58:30.382 --> 58:31.424
You're so silly.

58:31.592 --> 58:36.220
- You gonna be late tonight?
- It'll be 10:30, 11:00 before I get in.

58:36.388 --> 58:39.265
Don't wait up. I'll be there.

58:43.729 --> 58:45.396
Yeah, why don't you rent a movie?

58:45.606 --> 58:47.940
Something we can kick back to.

58:50.694 --> 58:54.113
- So, what you wearing?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

58:54.406 --> 58:58.701
She hung up a long time ago.
I was playing. I was playing.

59:00.412 --> 59:01.537
I was playing.

59:03.290 --> 59:06.542
Don't play like that. That's my family.
Don't break up a happy home.

59:06.793 --> 59:09.545
Stop wearing my clothes then.

59:11.882 --> 59:15.635
Everybody about the motherfucking
jokes today. Hello.

59:16.595 --> 59:17.970
I can't believe this.

59:18.263 --> 59:21.557
Come on, Eddie Dominguez's file
can't be that hard to get into.

59:21.808 --> 59:26.103
I tried 3 times, I just can't get in.
Besides, this is illegal.

59:26.730 --> 59:30.983
That never stopped you before.
Just let me know if you get anything.

59:31.276 --> 59:34.654
Anything for you.
But I can't get in. I tried.

59:47.668 --> 59:50.127
- What's up, Chet?
- Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

59:50.796 --> 59:52.255
Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

59:54.758 --> 59:56.300
The Lowrey Brothers.

59:57.094 --> 01:00:00.346
Let's just get down to Club Hell
and pick up Noah.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.682
Julie, it's me.

01:00:03.976 --> 01:00:06.519
You're supposed to get us
the Dominguez file.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.938
It'll take a day or two.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:12.650
- We don't have a day or two.
- I'm not the computer whiz.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:14.694
It'll take a while.

01:00:14.987 --> 01:00:18.406
- You ain't taking care of shit.
- I was thinking...

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:20.700
Hi.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.287
- You must be Marcus.
- I'd be Marcus.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.956
- That's right.
- Marcus, right?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:28.833
I'm Julie.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:32.211
Julie, hi. All right.
Nice to meet you.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.880
You too.
I recognized you from...

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.716
...every one of the photographs.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.635
Well, it's my man, you know.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.432
The wall.
Yeah, those on the wall.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:48.561
- You must be very good.
- I'm sorry?

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:53.024
As a partner.
Given your job, what you do.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.068
What time are we
doing this thing tonight?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.738
- Excuse me?
- Mike said we're going to a club.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.742
"We"...

01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:04.702
...as in me and my partner.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.039
You wanted protective custody.
You at my house.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.749
That's just great.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.837
I'll stay here with Chet the
mini-moron doorman to protect me?

01:01:15.047 --> 01:01:16.589
Chet is very good.

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:21.552
That looks like a stain on your rug.
Damn.

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:25.973
That was my baby, Luke. He gets
nervous in new surroundings...

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.558
He just shits.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:31.896
It's like marking his territory.
Sort of a male thing.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:35.274
I offered to pay Mike for the cleaning,
he wouldn't hear of it.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:38.027
- I'm gonna get rid of it.
- You don't need that.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:41.280
I was going to throw it out.
I want a new look.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.283
Mike, he's a special guy.
Mike is special.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.702
I call him Special Mike.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.706
It's funny, you can laugh at that.
That's why...

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:55.628
...I love him.
Now, me, I'd be pissed.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:01.008
- Look at this cute dog on the couch.
- That's Luke.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.636
Look how he crawls on the leather.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:07.306
You want to meet Duke?
He's in the bed. He's upset...

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:10.976
...and having diarrhea
and throwing up all morning.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.645
Oh, baby.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.981
Let's go see if little Duke
is going to be okay, shall we?

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.156
Me and you. Me and you.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.951
Mike.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.120
Who are you?

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.997
- Who are you?
- Look, you must get out.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.458
- Get your hands off me!
- Don't push me.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:35.793
I'm Yvette.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.503
Get your hands off me.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.338
What're you doing?

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.676
Get out. If you don't stop
stalking me, I'll arrest you.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.011
You old psycho.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.681
- You asshole!
- She's into some weird shit.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.476
What's going on out here?

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.979
That was crazy Yvette.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.856
Stalking me.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:01.569
Yvette? I forgot she was coming.
You threw Yvette out?

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:09.285
Yvette is a masseuse.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:15.207
She massages shit.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:17.668
She told me.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.671
Are there any other
totally hysterical...

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:24.633
...half-naked women popping by
that I should know about?

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.887
- She was naked?
- Titties were out a little bit.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:30.139
You threw Yvette out naked?

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.727
My wife would hate...

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:37.021
She hates womanizers.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:40.399
I don't believe...
Something's wrong with you.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:43.402
You don't respect other people's shit.
That's your problem.

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.905
I've been telling you that for years.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.698
Your trash is all over.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.575
Enough. Please.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.161
Me and my partner...

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:55.414
...we're going to Club Hell
so we can bust this fool, Noah.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:59.251
- Anybody have a problem with that?
- Fine.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:03.005
Don't blow the case.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.892
Here's the deal: You stay put.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:19.230
Anybody tells you to move, don't.
You're making a delivery for Fouchet.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:22.358
You got it? You got it? Frank?

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.778
It's ether. It'll explode, you dope.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.573
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.879
Noah.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.881
I remember you.

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:06.485
Check it, Lowrey...

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.655
...we got 2 days left.
Let's do this right.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.283
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.326
I'm not trying to lose my job.

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:17.913
As I recall, the last dead bad guys
belonged to you.

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.332
Next time you kill them...

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:24.670
...do it after you get the information
that we need. Just a suggestion.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:28.591
Please. You ain't even trying
to compare body counts.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.594
Should I keep going?

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:32.928
I'm out.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:36.348
Noah's parole jacket
says he works in there.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.685
We're standing out front arguing
like a couple of schoolgirls.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.937
Let's put an end to all this bickering.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.649
Because you're starting
to get on my nerves.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.947
He got no package.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.217
Look at you. Look at you.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:15.054
- Can you stay focused?
- What you talking about? I'm focused.

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:18.223
Focused on all this ass around here.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.726
Let's do what we came to do
and get out of here.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.061
- Simple.
- Fine.

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:25.064
Let's split. Check around.
Meet at the bar in 10 minutes.

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.149
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.281
Holy shit, what the hell is he doing?

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.077
Oh, man! That's the cop!
There he is.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.579
That's him! I'm going.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:51.090
What's up?

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:56.387
Budweiser. Feel like I had
a million of them.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.109
What's up, motherfucker?

01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:26.625
Tell me where the girl is.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.495
Fuck.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:17.134
Next time, learn how to work
the safety with your punk-ass.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:18.676
I'll be back.

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:28.979
Who whupped your ass now?

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.191
This really ain't the fucking time.

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:35.027
They know.
Let's get Noah and get out of here.

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:53.337
It's the chick.
Look, the chick.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.839
The girl. The bitch from the rooftop!

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.448
Julie!

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.884
- Let's go.
- That was the guy who shot Max.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.602
The truck.
Come on, let's take the truck.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.020
There! Go!

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:54.106
Move it! Move it!

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:55.899
We're really in a hurry.

01:09:58.069 --> 01:09:59.111
Let's go.

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:02.531
You're cops. Why are we
running away? He's in there.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.866
Here. Go!

01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:15.294
This is good.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:16.962
Noah's chasing us.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:21.300
What was that?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.760
That was...
I don't know.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.931
But I had a perfect shot at him
if your friend Action Jackson here...

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:32.394
No. This is official police business.

01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:36.315
You had no business in there.
Can you please drive this thing?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:39.318
- Please drive.
- Don't bring it here, all right?

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:41.820
You picked a slow-ass
ice-cream truck.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:45.824
- What am I smelling?
- Just drive.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.493
- What am I smelling?
- Ether.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.954
Extremely flammable ether.

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:52.247
Oh, shit.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:53.665
Goddamn.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.292
You the man.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.793
You the man tonight.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:11:00.047
How you pick an ice-cream truck
that's a bomb?

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.303
Shit.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.347
This is protective custody?

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:09.640
Yes.

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.857
Shit.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.874
You better do something.
We're running out of road.

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:37.793
Who picked this dumb-ass road?

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:40.545
All the road in Miami
and you run out of it.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.631
Come up with an idea, fast.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.092
Why do I gotta come up
with all the ideas?

01:11:58.106 --> 01:11:59.314
Take this shit.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.900
Dead end.
There's no more road.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.828
We out of fucking road!

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.043
- Motherfucker's going to blow!
- Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:35.767
Well...

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.146
Should I add this to your body count?

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.234
There goes our only lead to the dope.

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:46.570
Ain't this a bitch.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.114
The dope?

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.743
What are you talking about?

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:57.205
How about, "There goes our only lead
to Max's killer"? He's still out there.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:02.461
But that's not really important, it's not
your job to protect people. Holy shit.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.130
- See what I'm saying? She's crazy.
- I'm crazy?

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.053
Her rocker's gone.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:14.139
What's wrong with you?
Stop your barking. This is the witness.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:16.975
She done zoomed.
That's it, you deal with her.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:21.229
- No way.
- Listen, yes, okay, you're right.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:24.816
This whole thing started because
of missing drugs. But let me tell you:

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:29.446
There's nothing, absolutely nothing
more important to Mike...

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.074
...than doing this guy that killed Max.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:37.162
I know, sometimes he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.209
Come on.
It's gonna be all right, okay?

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.002
We need you.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.171
Part of the team.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:50.133
I thought he was supposed to be
the smooth one.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.512
This has not been a good day.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:57.849
Damn right. This is bullshit.
We got 2 days to find these fools...

01:13:58.101 --> 01:14:01.311
...and we got no leads because you
cooked Noah's ass on the freeway.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:07.651
- Shampoo?
- Hello.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.655
Well, let's just do that.

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.324
What's up?

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:21.665
Julie, it don't take that long
to get shampoo.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.834
- Come on, let's go.
- Look at this.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.752
"Animal tested. Animal tested."

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.547
You know how many chemicals
are in this?

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.758
I don't care if you go bald.
Just get it and let's go.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:34.052
Jojo.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.387
He's a chemist.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:39.015
Too much heroin and too much ether
for nobody to know nothing.

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:40.809
What's he talking about?

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.229
You know the barrels of ether
that blew up on the truck?

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.481
They were gonna used that
to process heroin.

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:49.359
They do that to cut it.
It quadruples the value.

01:14:49.569 --> 01:14:52.195
You can't just stick it
in the microwave.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.406
Let's pay for this.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.912
- How much is that?
- $14.25.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.373
I must have
left my wallet somewhere.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.792
Freeze, motherbitches!

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:08.670
- Don't move.
- Wait.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.298
- I'm not understanding. I really don't
- Shut up.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:15.302
- Do you just attract violence?
- Shut the fuck up.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:18.054
Take it easy, all right?
We're police officers.

01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:21.516
You're not police officers.
I'm not stupid. I know.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.393
- Wait.
- I've seen police.

01:15:23.603 --> 01:15:28.273
- I'm gonna reach for my badge, okay?
- You want badges, motherbitch?

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:30.025
I give you badges.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:32.694
Here. 99 cents.
I sell you some.

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:35.697
They got 8 badges.
I told you this cop thing don't work.

01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:38.825
I blow you. Then I blow you.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:41.828
Blow me? What the fuck?
No, hump me, that's all right.

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:45.373
I kill before. I kill again.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.417
- Please, hold on.
- I'll blow you.

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:48.835
- Hump me.
- Hold on.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.839
Do you see the emotion I'm going
through? That means this is serious.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:56.635
That means me and this motherfucker
is not vibing right now.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:59.846
- You got something on your chest?
- I got something.

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:03.225
- Hello. The guy's got a cannon.
- What do you want?

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:05.644
You want some?
Then come get it.

01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:07.771
- I'm gone.
- Freeze, bitch!

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:09.648
You freeze, bitch.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.984
Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:14.736
Now back up.

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:19.241
Put the gun down. And get me a pack
of tropical fruit Bubblicious.

01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:21.493
And some Skittles.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.583
Hell of a night.
I'm going to bed.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:33.171
So make yourself at home.
It's your bed.

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.383
I'll sit down...

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.176
...for a minute.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:42.806
Because I'm guarding shit.
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:46.017
I can see things real well, you know...

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:47.894
...from my peripherals.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:50.188
For such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:54.609
...you sure seem a little rigid
about having a girl in your bed.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:56.903
Who?

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:59.614
Me? Mike Lowrey?
I'm not rigid.

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:02.534
Comfortable.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.954
It's my bed.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:09.708
I don't know. I think it's more
than just wired.

01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:12.711
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:15.213
I never really shot a gun before.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.507
All that steel...

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:21.678
I'm feeling...
Don't you feel a little funny?

01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:24.639
I'm not a comedian, but...

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:28.643
I don't mean that kind of funny,
I mean, like...

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:30.061
...funny.

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:40.488
You don't want that.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.742
You don't want that,
because when I come...

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.535
...I come with thunder.

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:47.078
And that's...

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:50.749
You sound like you're saving yourself
for marriage.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.961
No, that ain't me there.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.047
That's Marcus.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:59.341
You know what I'm saying?
He's the man.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:02.177
I got some other...
Oh, no.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:05.263
I done seen it now.
Turn the page.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:08.224
Turn the page.
I done already seen it.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:10.685
Don't laugh.

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:14.397
I cannot believe he wore
his Afro that big.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:17.525
- I forgot about that.
- He looked cute like that.

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:20.111
What's Marcus' wife like?

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:25.992
She's like a wife.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:31.122
I mean, she must be pretty amazing
to keep a guy like Marcus.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.586
Keep a guy like what?

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:40.256
You know, watching him tonight,
he's very...

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.133
...sort of take charge.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:45.804
The way he was throwing guys
this way and that.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:50.725
There's something about him.
I don't know what. He's so smooth.

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:52.435
Boy...

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:53.937
...I bet...

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:58.316
...his wife's enjoying the smoothness
right this minute.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:04.155
- He got a quality women respond to.
- Sure.

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:08.493
I can't imagine the kind of woman
that wouldn't find Marcus...

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.328
...attractive.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:13.415
Probably couldn't be around him...

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:16.167
...just like our situation.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:20.004
- lf two people were alone...
- No, not with a guy like that.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.256
Excuse me.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.262
What is wrong with him?

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:30.432
This one goes on
the bulletin board at work.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.851
Don't do that, no, come on.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.687
Mike, put it back in.
I can't believe you took it out.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.815
Come on. Marcus'll kill us
if he finds out. Give it to me.

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:41.067
I can't believe I let you see it.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.444
Motherfucker.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.035
Goddamn it.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.121
Got some jewelry for you.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.373
I'm sorry, but damn that.

01:19:55.583 --> 01:20:00.670
We need to address this serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.965
- Please.
- Is this legal? I don't think it's legal.

01:20:04.175 --> 01:20:05.216
I won't be long.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.218
It's legal.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.887
Out of sight.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.683
Sanchez, Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen.

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:16.060
I think these guys
are about to make a move.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:19.397
Blue convertible. Two occupants.
Check it out.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:28.031
- Here we go.
- Is that our guy?

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.366
Where's the girl?

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:32.118
I don't see any girl.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.002
Fuck off, barking-ass dog.
Shut up.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.590
Sneak up on my own
motherfucking house.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.635
What in the world?

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:49.928
Very strange.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:53.389
His ass is upstairs.
Supposed to be my boy.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:54.766
You motherfucker.

01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:57.227
Ducking and weaving,
up and down.

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.771
Look at this shit.
This is what you want?

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:02.524
Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.193
No, I ain't going out like that.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:08.029
Don't take nobody that long
to get in bed.

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.783
Got my babies in the house.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.953
The man can't get no quality time...

01:21:15.246 --> 01:21:18.748
...but my partner gets quality time.
I don't play that shit.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:30.301
- Somebody's out there.
- Get the kids. Get the kids.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:35.265
I knew it. I didn't even
have to call a fucking psychic line.

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:36.641
Freeze!

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:43.439
Move, and you're dead.

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.986
They're going to shoot each other.
This is unbelievable.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:51.281
- Miami Police! Freeze!
- I am the police!

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:52.991
Marcus, what are you doing?

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.201
- You're doing Theresa.
- No, I'm not.

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:56.828
- You're doing my baby.
- Shut up.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.083
We could sneak up and
snuff them both right now.

01:22:02.293 --> 01:22:04.085
But we're suppose to get the girl.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:07.130
Never fuck with
a cop's family, asshole.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.173
- Doesn't that piss you off?
- Yeah.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:12.010
Don't get me started.
Out of the car.

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:14.304
Motherfucker.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.431
This whole shit is making you crazy.

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:19.517
You know it ain't nothing going on
between me and Theresa.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:26.024
I've been your partner for six years...

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.109
...and your boy all my life.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.986
For you to even think...

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:33.364
To let dumb shit
like that get in your mind.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:35.366
This is me.
What's wrong with you?

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.245
Fucking...

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:41.831
I'm just...

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.046
I'm fine.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.882
Get out of here.
Where's Julie?

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:53.468
She's in the car, handcuffed
to the steering wheel.

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:55.637
Are you trying to blow this case?

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:57.639
My bad.
I ain't had no quality time.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:01.684
You know how it is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:08.733
- My bad, all right?
- It's cool, man.

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:11.194
Go, go. All right.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:18.242
These phone calls were made
to Club Hell from this precinct.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.078
Explain.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:24.207
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Give me a goddamn name!

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.047
- All I know is his name.
- Give me his name.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.342
You're looking at a lot of time,
you know that?

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.094
Fouchet.

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:37.595
Fouchet, I think.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:42.725
- That's his whole name, "Fouchet"?
- Fouchet. I'm just an errand boy.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:44.811
Stop it, please. You'll make me cry.

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:47.730
I swear. Watching the house
was my first gig.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.274
How sweet.
Does that make you union?

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:52.777
If you were a real cop...

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:55.071
...in the field, working every day...

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.825
...you'd realize shit happens.
- Don't give me that crap.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.952
You're on your way
to being reassigned.

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:03.538
- Shut down.
- Who'll reassign me? You?

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:06.916
You don't have the authority
to reassign me. So until you do...

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:08.459
...stay the hell out of here.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.963
They should just bone
and get that shit over with.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.966
I'm getting really tired of this.

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.884
You're tired?

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:23.099
They're overfed, lazy.
We need video surveillance.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.144
- These guard dogs are nothing.
- Jojo.

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:28.104
Don't make this hard.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.985
Nice running into you, Jojo.

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.988
Always making it
hard on yourself, Jojo.

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:39.991
Gee, Julie, what have you been up to
the last couple of days?

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:43.453
Nothing. Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:46.873
We're looking for someone who could
step on a shit-load of heroin.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:49.834
Do it real fast, real well.
We're looking for a real pro.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:52.962
I told you,
I'm in the rubber business now.

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:55.631
Jojo, we're not playing, man.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.760
I'm telling you, I'm straight.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:02.930
I'm straight like a board, like an arrow.
I'm so straight, it's sick.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:07.185
It's a lot of dope.
Who could cut it real quick?

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:09.812
Cut it?
You mean, cut it up?

01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:12.440
I'm sick of this bullshit.

01:25:13.817 --> 01:25:15.193
Bullshit.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:19.363
- What's up?
- You're pulling a gun on me?

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:22.909
You're cops. I can't believe this.
I should turn you in to Hard Copy.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.660
- Put your ass on TV.
- What you doing?

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:26.913
I got this. Jojo...

01:25:27.915 --> 01:25:30.458
...I got 15 bullets in this gun.
- Mike.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:34.879
If you don't start talking, I'll fill
your lying ass with some hot shit.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.964
He's a former ganja-smoking fucker.

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:38.966
- He ain't worth it.
- You want some?

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:40.635
I'll bust your ass too!

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:42.970
So sad.

01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:44.555
You're on your own.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.227
- What's up, Jo?
- But I'll tell you like this...

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.855
...you splatter his ass,
he's no good to us. Fuck that.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:55.525
Fuck that.
I'm not going down over this shit.

01:25:55.692 --> 01:25:59.821
I'm not going down for you
killing Jojo the tire man.

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:04.492
I don't want no brain fragments on me.
It gets in your clothes and it stinks.

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:06.577
Fuck that.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:10.540
I'll tell you what I know. I don't
know everything about everything.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:13.584
- Tell him something.
- There's three guys.

01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:16.546
They got a laboratory...
No, no.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:20.383
Two guys. One guy died in
a plane crash last year.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:22.260
used to be more.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:26.764
No, it's one guy, really.
It's only one guy.

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:28.724
Don't fuck with me.

01:26:28.976 --> 01:26:32.186
This guy's an Einstein,
genius college boy...

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:35.189
...egghead motherfucker.
He got glasses.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.441
His rich parents
live in Coconut Grove.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.735
Where? Tell him again, Jojo.

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:41.237
I'll tell you where.

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.282
You'd do that for us?

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:49.912
I want to help. Stick that gun down.
I got the address...

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:51.289
...in the...

01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:53.499
...office.

01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:58.379
- Thanks. Why don't you get it?
- Cool.

01:26:58.547 --> 01:26:59.797
- Go.
- Now?

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.258
Now's good. Now is real good.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:03.718
This is on me.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:07.889
Why don't you pick out some
white walls? A gift from me to you.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.644
You made me think
you were going to shoot me.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:15.104
I was.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.443
When's this punk-ass chemist
coming home?

01:27:20.611 --> 01:27:22.111
So...

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.322
...this is a stakeout.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.157
Not what I imagined.

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:29.118
Thought there'd be more conversation.

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:31.996
Sorry, it's not up to your...

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.831
...usual high standards.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.834
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:40.796
What is it?
Too much caffeine?

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.548
Not enough sex?

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:44.842
I can't believe she went there.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.803
You don't know who
you talking to?

01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:50.306
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:53.309
King Ding-a-ling.

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.811
Why don't you whip it out
for her, big boy?

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:58.022
Yeah, right on your forehead.

01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.357
Shut up.

01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:10.159
There he is.
Let's go.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:12.078
- Let's go.
- I'm on him.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:27.885
What are our chances?

01:28:28.387 --> 01:28:30.012
Remember Club Hell?

01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:31.389
Worse.

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:35.059
That's it. Call major backup.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:38.020
I want motherfucking
swimming ducks in here.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.480
Hold it.

01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:44.402
Sinclair tapped every phones in
the station. We must do that in person.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.488
Shit. By the time we deal
with her bullshit...

01:28:47.698 --> 01:28:50.825
...every junkie in America
will be high off our bust.

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:53.995
Can we help you?

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:59.041
I staked out all night
in that jalopy too. I earned a peek.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:03.546
This is real cop stuff, okay?
This is not Charlie's Angels.

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.090
Can't hurt for her to take a peek.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:10.219
It can't hurt to look?
If they fire a bullet over here, it'll hurt.

01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:20.146
We have guests.

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:21.772
Have them followed.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.358
Don't do anything,
just call me with their location.

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:34.618
This high-speed chase, ending
near River and 34th Streets...

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:37.538
...was captured 2 nights ago
by our news team.

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.166
Mom!

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:45.296
You said Daddy was in Cleveland.

01:29:45.756 --> 01:29:49.425
- Can't be in Cleveland.
- The officers didn't like our cameras.

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:52.303
No. Your daddy just wishes
he was in Cleveland.

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:56.432
I'm telling you, this Fouchet,
he's slick.

01:29:57.684 --> 01:30:00.644
FBI, DEA, they got nothing on him.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:03.314
But he got to deal with us today.

01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:15.701
What's that?

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:19.997
That's the last time they handcuff me.
That's what that is.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.707
Good boy.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.669
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:28.005
All visitors must be announced.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:29.715
Pisses me off.

01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:31.801
Lady. Lady.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:36.514
When you get back,
this'll be over, right?

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:38.099
You got that right.

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:41.477
Now don't worry.
You'll be set free.

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:42.770
Cut loose.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.773
You'll be back to your own life.

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.859
No more handcuffs.

01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:56.700
- I'm out of here.
- That's Chet with my veggie burger.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:59.036
- Move your ass.
- You got it.

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:04.458
Hi, can I help you?

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:07.711
I'm here to kill
my husband, Marcus Burnett.

01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:10.714
The tall one,
or the short one?

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:12.174
The short one.

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:14.385
Thought so.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.137
Is Chet ringing...

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:17.972
Oh, babe.

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:27.982
- Let me get your husband.
- Marcus, get over here.

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:34.321
I know what it looks like.
Did you get my message?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.784
Can you...

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.494
...leave me and...

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:42.580
...Mrs. Burnett alone?

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:44.415
Right.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:47.585
Y'all met?

01:31:48.295 --> 01:31:49.420
Baby...

01:31:50.297 --> 01:31:52.298
I know... Let me...

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:56.802
As far as I'm concerned, keep the
wedding ring in your pocket...

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.721
...because you, your girlfriend...

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.514
Oh, shit.

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:03.767
- and Mike will be
very happy living here.

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:05.769
Sweetie. Sweetie, honey.

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:11.692
No, no, I saw it on the news.

01:32:12.319 --> 01:32:15.446
That shit be having a slant.

01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.450
You're no longer welcome
to my house.

01:32:19.618 --> 01:32:22.453
He didn't tell you
I was coming in the airport early?

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:25.873
Remember, I said call,
and that you'd bring me to your place?

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.042
Tell her what I told you?

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.878
- You were gonna bring me here...
- Julie!

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.132
I ain't even going to...

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:36.967
We're not arguing.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:38.469
I'm raising my...

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.221
All right... Baby.

01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:41.972
Believe me, we wanted to tell you.

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:47.102
It really doesn't matter, Marcus...
Mike, Kojak, whatever your name is.

01:32:47.479 --> 01:32:49.647
I'll tell you something else:

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:53.901
If his wife can find us,
I'm better off on my own.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:55.402
This...

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:57.404
I can see how it'd look a trip.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:01.408
You see me, I run out,
I got a shirt open.

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:03.410
You see Mike half-naked.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.621
Then you see the white girl.

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:10.000
It looks like we having an orgy,
and ain't nobody humped.

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:12.670
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:15.506
It's not what it looks like, okay?

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.175
Baby, she's a material witness.

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:20.886
That's real.

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:22.763
Baby, Theresa, listen.

01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:25.599
It was orders.
Listen, it was orders.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:31.105
Can I talk to you?
Can you stop so I can talk to you?

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:34.692
Enough smooth shit, Mike.
It's not going to work anymore.

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.036
I don't care what you say.

01:33:51.710 --> 01:33:52.835
Duck.

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:54.295
Julie, get down!

01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:55.629
Get down!

01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:28.495
Get out!

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.504
911!

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.760
911? Chet here.

01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:45.095
Go upstairs and take this.
Take it!

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:50.267
I'll keep everybody calm
until my backup arrive.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.061
I love you.

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:55.105
I forgot to give them the address.

01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:32.810
Go, go, go!

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:34.019
Watch out!

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:35.646
Keep going.

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:39.149
Get her in.

01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:09.179
Move!

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:23.986
It's okay.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:27.072
I'm with the police. It's cool.
You look great.

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:55.309
Drive!

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:33.764
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

01:37:46.945 --> 01:37:48.070
What is it with you?

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:50.447
How come it always has to be
good news/bad news?

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:54.076
You know where the dope is,
but you lose our witness.

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:56.954
- I don't get it.
- Lowrey, pick up your phone.

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:00.082
- Lowrey.
- Hi, Mr. Lowrey.

01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:04.795
I'm keeping your friend for 4 hours,
until I make my deal.

01:38:04.963 --> 01:38:07.130
And I will make my deal.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:09.299
I just put a bullet in the chemist...

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:12.261
...who fucked with my timetable.

01:38:13.054 --> 01:38:15.597
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:17.307
Son of a bitch!

01:38:20.603 --> 01:38:22.896
That twisted motherfucker
shot one of his employees.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:25.566
Says if we don't back up,
he'll kill Julie.

01:38:25.775 --> 01:38:26.900
Not now.

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.569
I told you to play by the rules.

01:38:28.778 --> 01:38:31.280
Don't do this now.
I'm on the verge of solving this case.

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:34.825
I've finally got the authority
to shut you down.

01:38:35.076 --> 01:38:36.702
You're all reassigned.

01:38:42.625 --> 01:38:45.669
This guy is painting me into a corner.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.088
He'll kill the girl anyway.
We won't let her die.

01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:51.508
We're not walking away.
I don't care what she says.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.802
The deal goes down in 4 hours.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:56.930
You got 2 hours to find them.

01:38:58.016 --> 01:38:59.808
It's time to get lucky.

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.519
Go do what you got to do.

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:09.026
You told us that this thing would
move a little quicker.

01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:12.988
It's not that easy.
If it was, you'd be doing it.

01:39:13.489 --> 01:39:15.991
Work your magic.
You say you're a computer whiz.

01:39:16.242 --> 01:39:20.329
Back up off me.
I'm doing an illegal favor for you.

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:24.166
This is what I went to jail for in the first
place. So you back up off me.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:28.003
You don't sit your lanky ass down,
bottom line...

01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:31.381
...I will knock you the fuck out.
What's wrong with you?

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.967
- Can you have a seat?
- You said I'd get out ofjail.

01:39:34.177 --> 01:39:35.802
And I wasn't lying.

01:39:38.681 --> 01:39:40.390
Cops are so dumb.
Look, it's coming up.

01:39:42.852 --> 01:39:44.978
Remember, you promised
to get me out.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.148
Eddie Dominguez.

01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:50.984
There it is.

01:39:55.198 --> 01:39:56.657
Girlfriend?

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:07.584
It was New Year's Eve,
and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:09.670
...and this French guy...

01:40:10.088 --> 01:40:12.839
...they took some
horrible pictures of me.

01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:14.299
They said...

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:18.553
...they'd put them up on the
bulletin board at my kid's school...

01:40:18.805 --> 01:40:21.765
...unless I gave them
narcotics information.

01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:24.601
But I never, never gave them you...

01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:26.103
...or the girl.

01:40:26.396 --> 01:40:28.855
They got her.
We need to get them now.

01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:33.026
If we don't, they're gonna kill her.
How do you make contact?

01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:35.278
I have their mobile-phone number.

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.950
I know, I'm sorry. Listen.

01:40:40.243 --> 01:40:43.120
I'll make it up to you.
I will. I'll do anything you want.

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:45.455
We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.420
You have sexy ears, you know that?

01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.088
I want to lick them.

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:58.385
Can I speak to Romeo?

01:40:58.636 --> 01:41:02.222
There's no Romeo here, asshole.
Who you laughing at?

01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:06.977
This cell phone will triangulate him,
no matter where he goes.

01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:09.479
We watch the map until he stops.

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:14.317
- Sector 2-3-4.
- The signal's still strong.

01:41:14.485 --> 01:41:17.612
- We still have a lock.
- Come on.

01:41:19.157 --> 01:41:20.407
Thank you.

01:41:20.992 --> 01:41:23.827
Lucy was the queen, baby.
Think about it.

01:41:23.995 --> 01:41:26.163
Lucille Ball was a bimbo.
What you talking about?

01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:29.166
- Desi was the brains behind it.
- How can you say that?

01:41:29.375 --> 01:41:32.919
- What do you mean?
- Take the bongos away, he's nothing.

01:41:33.129 --> 01:41:34.379
It's conga.

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:37.174
Yo, fellas, what's up?

01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:39.593
The fucking pencil squad.

01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:41.344
Are we on traffic duty?

01:41:41.596 --> 01:41:45.098
No, this is real.
We got something for you.

01:41:45.308 --> 01:41:47.684
This shit could get you killed.

01:41:50.688 --> 01:41:51.980
Let's go.

01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:06.703
It's Conrad.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:08.705
I'm calling in a favor.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.210
Eastbound towards 135th Street.

01:42:15.296 --> 01:42:17.047
Northeast, go northeast.

01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:20.008
If I'm wrong about this,
you can fire my ass.

01:42:20.343 --> 01:42:22.052
This is what I need:

01:42:22.428 --> 01:42:24.554
I need a SWAT team, helicopters.

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:28.517
We're calling all cars.
Only I don't know where I need them.

01:42:30.186 --> 01:42:32.938
- Very nice car you got there.
- Oh, yeah.

01:42:33.523 --> 01:42:34.815
That's my toy.

01:42:35.024 --> 01:42:37.317
I'm taking it with me
for my collection.

01:42:37.944 --> 01:42:40.695
And how about the wire transfers?

01:42:42.198 --> 01:42:45.033
Two wire transfers to your banks...

01:42:45.827 --> 01:42:48.370
...totaling 180 million dollars.

01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:51.248
And 20 in cash.

01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:57.754
Damn.

01:43:02.426 --> 01:43:04.594
This has been a shitty week.

01:43:05.972 --> 01:43:08.598
Getting full integration on that signal.

01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:15.730
Yeah, we're on the airfield now.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.066
I bet it's up in the old hangar section.

01:43:24.282 --> 01:43:26.283
Pick it up. Pick it up.

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:29.286
Deposit confirmation requested.

01:43:29.495 --> 01:43:31.621
$90 million, Geldersbank of Zurich.

01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:37.961
No easy approach.

01:43:38.129 --> 01:43:39.713
No time.
Fuck the backup.

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.798
We gotta go now.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:43.800
Not a problem.

01:43:47.013 --> 01:43:49.973
You got an itch?
I'd love to scratch it.

01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:51.224
Scratch this.

01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:55.061
I'll scratch whatever you want,
blue-eyed bitch.

01:43:55.271 --> 01:43:56.313
Did you go to college?

01:44:07.033 --> 01:44:08.074
Thank you.

01:44:10.036 --> 01:44:12.621
- You sure you want to do this?
- Let's go.

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:16.416
- Tuck in your skirt. Come on.
- My shit always works sometimes.

01:44:20.922 --> 01:44:24.424
This is the best you can buy.
Nice doing business with you.

01:44:35.937 --> 01:44:36.978
Oh, shit.

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:39.856
It's a setup.

01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:48.698
If I get killed,
I'm fucking you up.

01:44:51.577 --> 01:44:53.036
Goddamn it, go.

01:44:56.374 --> 01:44:57.666
Go, goddamn it.

01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:17.227
My God.

01:46:04.025 --> 01:46:05.066
Julie!

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:37.307
Get down!

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.810
Shit!

01:46:45.316 --> 01:46:46.900
You forgot your boarding pass.

01:47:11.092 --> 01:47:13.009
You motherfuckers.

01:47:14.345 --> 01:47:16.429
What's up?

01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:18.014
Shit.

01:48:12.194 --> 01:48:13.736
Mike, let's go.

01:48:14.238 --> 01:48:15.572
Mike, get in the car.

01:48:18.868 --> 01:48:20.785
Get in. Come on.

01:48:21.871 --> 01:48:24.497
- Let's go. Get in.
- Get in the car, goddamn it.

01:48:24.707 --> 01:48:26.875
Get in. This shit's going to blow.

01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:29.502
Get up!

01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:54.110
Shit. Please, catch that motherfucker,
he shot me.

01:48:54.403 --> 01:48:56.321
- He shot you, he shot me.
- You all right?

01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:59.782
I'm fine. I just had a run-in
with Jim Brown over here.

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:02.952
He steals our shit...

01:49:03.245 --> 01:49:04.329
...kidnaps Julie...

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:08.082
...shoots at my wife.
We beating him down.

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:14.464
Marcus, I just got
one question for you.

01:49:14.715 --> 01:49:17.884
How can you leave me at a gunfight
to get the car?

01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:20.345
Shut up and let him drive.

01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:30.813
Getting shot improved
your driving skills.

01:49:34.985 --> 01:49:36.736
You got the right to remain silent.

01:49:39.281 --> 01:49:42.951
Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:49:43.244 --> 01:49:45.161
- What you doing?
- Getting it out the way.

01:49:56.257 --> 01:49:57.507
Punch it. Go!

01:50:03.806 --> 01:50:06.349
- What if his car's faster?
- This is the fastest car.

01:50:06.517 --> 01:50:10.019
It'll be one or the other!
It'll be him or it'll be us!

01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:18.194
You better win.

01:50:38.549 --> 01:50:40.633
That's how you're supposed to drive.

01:50:40.884 --> 01:50:43.636
From now on, that's how you drive!

01:51:10.039 --> 01:51:11.539
Freeze!

01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:18.171
He ain't worth killing.

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.886
Freeze!

01:51:52.289 --> 01:51:54.791
Bet when your punk-ass
woke up this morning...

01:51:55.084 --> 01:51:58.795
...you didn't think by 5:00
you'd have a hole in your leg.

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:05.259
You couldn't kill me,
you chickenshit, could you?

01:52:05.969 --> 01:52:07.970
I could.
You're talking like it's over.

01:52:08.138 --> 01:52:09.597
I'm just pausing.

01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:13.226
I'm getting the hang of this
marksman shit.

01:52:13.727 --> 01:52:17.397
Shooting them from 30 yards
while they run, that's not it.

01:52:17.606 --> 01:52:18.731
Here's where it is.

01:52:19.483 --> 01:52:22.610
- Point blank, up close and personal.
- Mike.

01:52:22.903 --> 01:52:24.946
That's what I'm talking about.

01:52:25.739 --> 01:52:28.658
- Would you do it?
- Mike, step off.

01:52:30.285 --> 01:52:32.495
Do it. Do it!

01:52:34.164 --> 01:52:35.498
Do it!

01:52:41.338 --> 01:52:43.005
It's over.

01:52:49.096 --> 01:52:50.138
He's a joke.

01:52:50.764 --> 01:52:52.515
He's a motherfucking joke.

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:20.668
I ever tell you I love you, man?

01:53:21.336 --> 01:53:25.131
You always be getting emotional
after a gunfight.

01:53:25.883 --> 01:53:27.592
Because I'm glad we survived.

01:53:27.843 --> 01:53:29.343
Shit.

01:53:29.553 --> 01:53:31.471
What you talking about?

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:34.474
I love you too.

01:53:35.392 --> 01:53:38.728
Don't be looking at me. I love you.
I said that shit.

01:53:38.896 --> 01:53:39.979
You my boy.

01:53:40.564 --> 01:53:42.899
No, no, you like my brother, man.

01:53:43.150 --> 01:53:44.650
So what am I?

01:53:47.112 --> 01:53:49.071
Julie, sweetie, you...

01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:51.240
You're a little dangerous.

01:53:51.492 --> 01:53:55.411
See, you like a magnet
for random gunfire.

01:53:56.413 --> 01:53:57.914
But you're cool.

01:53:58.415 --> 01:54:00.249
You're down.

01:54:01.627 --> 01:54:03.753
So what's next?

01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:08.257
See...

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.676
...there won't be no next.

01:54:13.847 --> 01:54:15.598
You wanted Mike Lowrey...

01:54:15.849 --> 01:54:17.016
...you got him.

01:54:17.267 --> 01:54:20.019
Right here. That's Mike.
Old Mike Lowrey.

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:23.898
I'm going home to my wife
to get my quality time.

01:54:24.566 --> 01:54:26.025
Stop playing, man.

01:54:26.276 --> 01:54:28.945
I've been beat 3 times out here.

01:54:29.196 --> 01:54:33.157
I'm cool, I don't need no help.
Back up. Don't need no help.

01:54:33.450 --> 01:54:37.537
Why you going home? You got shot
in your leg, your dick don't work.

01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:40.122
Marcus, do you have the keys?

01:54:40.624 --> 01:54:43.626
Mike wanted me to go
to this gunfight, then...

01:54:43.794 --> 01:54:46.295
Well, then
there was this witness...

01:54:47.548 --> 01:54:49.590
My man.
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.385
- Let me out of here.
- I don't got the keys.

01:54:52.594 --> 01:54:55.680
You don't have no keys?
Why wouldn't you have keys?

01:54:57.307 --> 01:54:59.809
Marcus, I thought you said
you love me.

01:54:59.977 --> 01:55:02.061
Show me love!
