Not that I don't want to go
to the Elegant Doily

00:27.361 --> 00:29.862
old people's home-- I mean,
I love doilies and all--

00:30.013 --> 00:32.364
but why are we doing this
on Thanksgiving again?

00:32.516 --> 00:33.774
Ginger went there
last Thanksgiving

00:33.868 --> 00:35.092
and said it was very rewarding.

00:35.185 --> 00:36.777
You know, play checkers
with old people,

00:36.871 --> 00:39.279
let 'em pinch your cheeks,
talk about their favorite wars.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.874
It's good to give back a little
since we have so much.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.709
So much of what, exactly?

00:43.936 --> 00:45.619
Napkins, maybe?
We did just stock up.

00:45.771 --> 00:48.363
Giving back sounds nice. I wish
I could give back to Merryl,

00:48.382 --> 00:50.698
but she left the Elegant Doily
and moved in with her boyfriend.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.867
Do you still say "boyfriend"
when they're in their 90s?

00:53.036 --> 00:54.444
You say "elderberry."

00:54.446 --> 00:55.946
Plus, your father and I
will probably end up

00:55.964 --> 00:57.413
in a home someday.

00:57.466 --> 00:58.891
It'll be a nice little preview.

00:59.118 --> 01:00.951
Oh, no, we'll never
be able to afford that.

01:01.044 --> 01:02.728
I'm excited to get back home
and get cracking

01:02.879 --> 01:04.063
on that maple glaze
for the turkey.

01:04.214 --> 01:06.290
Man, Thanksgiving
is the best holiday.

01:06.308 --> 01:08.734
There in the kitchen,
the excitement, the adrenaline.

01:08.811 --> 01:11.962
Oh, yeah. You're all fun
in the kitchen on Thanksgiving.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.221
Just, uh, getting a snack, uh...

01:13.240 --> 01:15.132
Hot plate! Hot plate!
Out of the way!

01:15.150 --> 01:16.891
-Hey, Dad, do you think
I could...
-Ask your mother!

01:16.985 --> 01:18.393
-Dinner's in 20 minutes!
-Aah!

01:18.412 --> 01:19.745
-No, no, no. 30.
-Aah!

01:19.896 --> 01:22.322
So, what would you say is
the minimum amount of time

01:22.474 --> 01:23.990
we can spend
at the Elegant Doily?

01:24.159 --> 01:25.733
Don't you worry your
pretty little hairy neck, Bob.

01:25.828 --> 01:28.403
<i> We'll get you home soon so you</i>
<i> can start doing your cooking.</i>

01:28.480 --> 01:30.255
<i> BOB: Oh, is my neck</i>
<i> that hairy right now?</i>

01:30.407 --> 01:32.332
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Yeah, it's probably</i>
<i> time to harvest.</i>

01:32.484 --> 01:34.484
Yep. Just like I remembered it.

01:34.578 --> 01:36.320
Oh, this is
where all the carpet is.

01:36.322 --> 01:38.764
Got-dang it.
Give me my damn orange soda!

01:38.991 --> 01:40.248
BOB:
Oh, hi, Sergeant Bosco.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.327
Are you here visiting
your very pleasant mom?

01:43.345 --> 01:44.678
Yeah, but she won't
come out of her room.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.180
And if Mother doesn't do
Thanksgiving activities

01:47.333 --> 01:48.999
with her nursing home
friends today,

01:49.017 --> 01:51.668
she'll gripe about it
all year long!

01:51.761 --> 01:52.853
You having soda troubles?

01:53.005 --> 01:54.279
You know,
the front's just glass.

01:54.506 --> 01:55.839
-You could smash it.
-Louise.

01:55.841 --> 01:57.841
-Or shoot it.
-Interesting, interesting.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.176
Let me help you with that.

01:59.194 --> 02:01.102
This machine is quite
the quarter gobbler.

02:01.196 --> 02:03.271
Ooh, stretchy keys. That's fun.

02:03.365 --> 02:04.865
Here you go.

02:05.017 --> 02:06.792
Ah, yeah.
Get in there, fructose.

02:07.019 --> 02:08.627
Thanks, Deirdre. Wish me luck.

02:08.778 --> 02:10.687
Oh, you're Deirdre. I'm Linda.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.522
-We spoke on the phone.
-Linda.

02:12.541 --> 02:14.358
And this must be
your lovely family.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.543
We prefer "hot family,"
thank you.

02:16.695 --> 02:19.171
Well, we are thankful you're
helping us out this morning.

02:19.365 --> 02:21.047
Follow me.
I'll get you all set up.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.975
Oh, I left the hard candies
in the car.

02:23.126 --> 02:24.977
Old people still like
hard candy, right?

02:25.128 --> 02:27.204
They love to unwrap them
whenever it's very quiet.

02:27.297 --> 02:29.481
You go ahead.
I'll catch up. I'll catch up.

02:29.708 --> 02:30.816
You will be helping out with

02:30.967 --> 02:32.876
a very important
Thanksgiving job:

02:32.895 --> 02:35.379
making the paper turkey
decorations.

02:35.397 --> 02:37.322
Gotcha. Do you want sturdy
turkeys or flirty turkeys?

02:37.474 --> 02:39.474
<i> PAUL (on walkie-talkie):</i>
<i> Deirdre, it's Paul.</i>

02:39.493 --> 02:41.142
<i>Mr. Thompson said that you said</i>

02:41.236 --> 02:43.311
<i> that he didn't have to</i>
<i> wear pants on holidays.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:46.147
No, I said always pants
all the time.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.891
-Disagree.
-Hi. How are you?

02:48.026 --> 02:49.317
Nice... nice turkey.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.078
You worry about
your own turkey, fella.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.988
BOSCO:
You want me to carry you?
I could.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.732
I've been doing
several push-ups a day

02:55.751 --> 02:57.009
before I take a shower.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.735
(scoffs)
Probably against the sink.

02:58.754 --> 03:00.295
Yeah, against the sink. So what?

03:00.406 --> 03:04.016
Hi. I couldn't help overhearing
your loud conversation.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.759
Seems like someone
doesn't want to join

03:05.853 --> 03:07.019
all the Thanksgiving fun.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.095
I'm Linda.
My family's here today,

03:09.248 --> 03:10.764
giving back-- no big deal.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.840
-So, can I help?
-My son has a gun.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.193
-Don't mess with us.
-Mother.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.862
Do you want two pounds
of hard candy?

03:17.089 --> 03:18.530
Take the candy.
Get rid of the lady.

03:18.682 --> 03:19.698
Close the door.

03:19.775 --> 03:21.349
GENE:
I'm having real trouble

03:21.443 --> 03:23.427
making turkey waddles
that don't look like testicles.

03:23.445 --> 03:24.778
-Me, too.
-ZEKE: Come on! Come on!

03:24.872 --> 03:25.871
TINA:
Is that Zeke?

03:26.098 --> 03:27.113
Is he wrestling his grandma?

03:27.266 --> 03:28.523
-Ah, come on!
-Hey, Zeke.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.616
Hey, Tina, girl.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.192
-Louise. G-man.
-Doctor.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.103
Did your grandparents
move in here or something?

03:33.196 --> 03:35.288
Tell 'em to watch out--
the hazing process is crazy.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.442
Nah, we're making paper turkeys
with testicles on their chins.

03:38.535 --> 03:40.052
-Oh, cool.
-What are you doing?

03:40.203 --> 03:42.612
Every year, my grandma
and the other elders watch

03:42.631 --> 03:45.632
the OMG Mall Group Thanksgiving
Day Parade on the TV.

03:45.784 --> 03:48.710
Oh, the OMGMGTDP?
I love that parade.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.562
Yeah, but the cable's out.

03:50.714 --> 03:52.880
Did you fix the cable yet, Zeke?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.233
Sorry, Grandma.

03:54.384 --> 03:56.735
I'm giving it all I got,
but it's just not enough.

03:56.886 --> 03:58.462
I'm sorry, everyone.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.722
We're not gonna be able
to watch the parade this year.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.056
-Oh, no.
-(grumbling)

04:02.076 --> 04:03.558
Man, that's a lot of frowning.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.244
-And new wrinkles, I bet.
-Dang it!

04:05.395 --> 04:07.746
I wish I was a wizard
so I could give these angels

04:07.897 --> 04:08.972
the parade they deserve.

04:09.065 --> 04:13.067
No OMGMGTDP on TGD? That's BS!

04:13.161 --> 04:15.737
It would be nice
to do something nice.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.739
Maybe that's how we could do
our giving back-ing.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.408
Maybe we could try to do
some kind of entertainment?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.094
Not a parade, but like a parade?

04:22.321 --> 04:24.654
These people want a parade,
specifically.

04:24.673 --> 04:26.080
They do have parade face.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.008
Hmm, we know they've got
some basic art supplies,

04:28.102 --> 04:29.584
and we've got our charisma.

04:29.678 --> 04:31.603
And a deep knowledge
of the American songbook.

04:31.755 --> 04:33.939
Are we doing a parade?
I think we're doing a parade.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.515
Well, I'm here all day.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.276
And I've cut enough
turkey face testicles

04:37.427 --> 04:39.169
for a lifetime, so I'm in.

04:39.187 --> 04:40.837
Good thing I brought
my bass drum.

04:40.856 --> 04:42.172
(imitates drumbeat)

04:42.265 --> 04:44.783
Guess what, everyone.
The parade is back on.

04:44.934 --> 04:47.010
-(cheering)
-Not on TV, though.

04:47.103 --> 04:49.179
-(murmuring)
-Oh, boy. Tough crowd.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.606
Your turkey is...
I would just start over.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.866
Oh, my God.

04:53.035 --> 04:54.701
DEIRDRE:
Hi. Can you cook
lots of food? No?

04:54.870 --> 04:57.037
Hey. Feel like cooking
a ton of food? No?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.447
Can anyone here cook
lots of food?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.799
Um, I can.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.526
So, yeah,
our cook had to step out

05:02.619 --> 05:04.528
for just a few minutes--
probably more.

05:04.546 --> 05:05.712
Her water broke.

05:05.864 --> 05:07.047
She's in labor--
at the hospital.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.308
And it turns out
our other cook is the father,

05:09.535 --> 05:12.126
so he's probably out
for the day as well.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.204
So there's no one to cook
all of this food

05:14.297 --> 05:15.963
-for the whole place.
-Right.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.724
-On Thanksgiving.
-Yes.

05:17.876 --> 05:19.526
-Well, I'm happy to do it.
-Really?

05:19.636 --> 05:21.227
I mean, even if you just
made the turkey

05:21.380 --> 05:23.213
and maybe mashed potatoes,
that would be amazing.

05:23.231 --> 05:25.382
Sure. Sure.
Yeah, I think I can handle it.

05:25.475 --> 05:26.883
I-I actually have a restaurant.

05:26.902 --> 05:28.885
That's incredible.
We are so lucky.

05:28.904 --> 05:31.145
Well, we're not
a popular restaurant.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.239
-Neither are we.
-We-we don't make
a lot of money.

05:33.392 --> 05:35.241
Neither do I.
Anyway, thank you.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.169
Hi, kitchen. I'm-I'm Bob.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.670
Uh, let's get into it.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.155
No, that sounded lame.
Sorry, kitchen.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.674
(in high-pitched voice):
It's okay.

05:42.826 --> 05:45.068
You're cooking Thanksgiving?
For the whole place?

05:45.087 --> 05:47.512
I know! I'm like the guy in
the audience who can play guitar

05:47.664 --> 05:49.681
and the band says,
"Can anyone play guitar?"

05:49.908 --> 05:52.667
-And I go onstage,
and it's amazing.
-Yeah, it's just like that, Bob.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.853
We can have our own dinner
at home a little late, right?

05:55.080 --> 05:56.930
Sure, but just
keep it simple in there.

05:57.082 --> 05:58.506
You know how you get
on Thanksgiving.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.674
You get a little amped up.

05:59.768 --> 06:01.434
What do you mean?
I'm amped down.

06:01.587 --> 06:03.177
You're gonna need some help.
I'll come soon.

06:03.271 --> 06:05.697
Sergeant Bosco's mom and I
are just starting to hit it off.

06:05.924 --> 06:06.923
When will she leave?

06:06.942 --> 06:08.141
Wait, aren't the kids with you?

06:08.293 --> 06:10.610
No. They left me
with the paper turkeys

06:10.704 --> 06:12.520
and a guy who was kind of mean.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.855
All right, I got to go.

06:13.949 --> 06:15.874
Knifey's ready to get dicey.

06:16.101 --> 06:18.377
You want us to be in the kitchen

06:18.528 --> 06:21.028
cooking with Dad
on Thanksgiving?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.455
(laughing):
No, thank you very much.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.031
He doesn't want anyone
in the kitchen

06:24.051 --> 06:26.109
with him on Thanksgiving.
He's a lone wolf.

06:26.128 --> 06:27.794
But slightly more hairy
and more vicious.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.888
Okay, I know
your father can be...

06:30.039 --> 06:31.539
-A Thankszilla?
-A Thankszilla.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.393
But at least one of you needs to
go in there and help out, okay?

06:34.620 --> 06:35.894
Ugh. Fine. Hand farts?

06:36.045 --> 06:37.879
-Weakest one goes with Dad?
-Yeah.
-Sure.

06:37.973 --> 06:39.806
(making fart sounds)

06:39.958 --> 06:40.899
(makes quiet sound)

06:41.050 --> 06:42.642
-No!
-Yes.
-Ha!

06:42.794 --> 06:43.885
I've been practicing.

06:43.979 --> 06:45.295
Damn these tiny hands!

06:45.313 --> 06:47.147
I don't want to cook
with Thankszilla.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.199
Y'all hand-farting?
I like to hand-fart.

06:53.472 --> 06:54.913
Dad? Mom told me to come in here

06:55.064 --> 06:56.564
to help you--
in a kitchen, on Thanksgiving.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.399
-Thoughts? Concerns?
-Oh, okay. Great.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.918
Oh, you don't seem so excited.

07:00.069 --> 07:01.327
Maybe I should just go.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.588
No, no, I mean,
I probably do need the help.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.740
And it could be fun.
Also, I feel like

07:05.834 --> 07:07.984
I got a good handle
on everything, schedule-wise.

07:07.986 --> 07:10.578
I guess, in a way, I've been
training my whole life for this.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.414
-So, there's potatoes
for mashed potatoes.
-Good eye.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.159
I found sausage,
so we'll make sausage stuffing.

07:16.178 --> 07:18.161
-There's turkey breasts.
-Put a bra on those.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.497
There's green beans.
There's cranberry sauce.

07:20.515 --> 07:22.256
Oh, you're probably
gonna want a headband,

07:22.276 --> 07:24.592
'cause we're in
the eye of the storm.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.186
-LOUIS: Settle down, tiger.
-BOB: Hey.
They have one of these.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.505
Whoa, what's that?
Some kind of kitchen gun?

07:28.523 --> 07:31.599
Sort of. It's a torch used
for finishing crème brûlée.

07:31.693 --> 07:33.510
It shoots fire
when you press this button.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.195
Let me see,
let me see, let me see.

07:35.347 --> 07:37.514
Hey, you know, I was gonna make
sweet potato casserole,

07:37.516 --> 07:39.791
and we could use this to brown
the marshmallows on top.

07:39.943 --> 07:42.202
A gun that makes fire?
Yes, please.

07:42.354 --> 07:44.296
Should we make fire
with it right now?

07:44.405 --> 07:46.206
No, we have lots to do
before that.

07:46.358 --> 07:47.966
But, tell you what,
how would you like

07:48.193 --> 07:50.210
to be Captain Casserole
and learn how to make it?

07:50.362 --> 07:53.213
Does, uh, Captain Casserole
get to shoot the fire gun?

07:53.365 --> 07:55.623
-She does, eventually.
-Then call me Captain.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.034
Wait, do I outrank you?
Oh, that's embarrassing.

07:58.127 --> 07:59.811
Uh-oh.
Now we're behind schedule.

08:00.038 --> 08:01.646
Uh, let's kick it in gear, okay?

08:01.723 --> 08:02.981
You-you sure you don't
want a headband?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.299
Ooh, you know,
I hear that all the cool seniors

08:05.393 --> 08:07.043
are hanging out
in the rec room today.

08:07.136 --> 08:09.136
You want to go check out
that scene? I do.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.548
No! I'm not going
until Gary calls.

08:11.566 --> 08:12.716
Who's Gary?

08:12.734 --> 08:14.642
-My brother.
-My other son.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.902
That's it, I'm carrying you out.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.388
What? No.
Uh, Sergeant Bosco,

08:18.406 --> 08:20.665
would you come look at
these pretty flowers with me?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.559
I bought those.
I've already seen 'em.

08:22.652 --> 08:23.835
Come on.

08:23.987 --> 08:25.170
Okay, this is not going great.

08:25.321 --> 08:27.080
Don't you do
hostage negotiations?

08:27.232 --> 08:30.157
-This is a hostage
negotiation, right?
-I guess.

08:30.235 --> 08:31.918
So, what's the first step
in one of those?

08:31.995 --> 08:34.012
Establish a rapport
to gain their trust.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.755
Hello. She's your mother.

08:35.907 --> 08:37.090
Right, so too late for that.

08:37.242 --> 08:38.925
Well, well,
wh-what's after that?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.427
Asking open-ended questions
to give them a sense of control

08:41.580 --> 08:42.670
and feel them out.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.171
Okay. All right.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.691
So, Lillian, do you like

08:46.918 --> 08:48.693
-open-ended questions?
-No.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.603
That's a closed-ended
question, Linda.

08:50.756 --> 08:51.846
Oh, right.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.031
How are the sweet potatoes
coming?

08:53.258 --> 08:55.016
Good, but I should check
the marshmallows,

08:55.035 --> 08:56.442
make sure they're ripe.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.261
Mmm. Tough to tell. Mmm!

08:58.280 --> 08:59.538
No eating, more peeling.

08:59.689 --> 09:02.082
Oh, they have brussels sprouts.
I can roast those.

09:02.158 --> 09:03.449
Wait, you want to add
another dish?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.101
Yeah, it'll complement
the stuffing.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.244
If we hustle, we can do it.

09:06.396 --> 09:08.104
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to shift from

09:08.106 --> 09:09.864
sweet potato casserole duty
to brussels sprouts.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm Captain Casserole.

09:12.277 --> 09:13.534
I took an oath.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.720
-I need you to wash these.
-Feels like a demotion.

09:15.872 --> 09:17.204
Really get in there,
and-and hurry.

09:17.299 --> 09:18.281
How's it going in here?

09:18.300 --> 09:19.799
-LOUISE: Eh.
-BOB: Going great.

09:19.951 --> 09:22.135
Welcome to the
Almost OMG Mall Group

09:22.229 --> 09:23.620
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

09:23.713 --> 09:25.546
We've got a hell of a show
for you today.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.640
Let's go to Tina,
who's on the parade route. Tina?

09:27.793 --> 09:30.310
Thank you. I'm here with
a very special person, Ruth.

09:30.462 --> 09:32.629
Ruth, where did you
travel from today?

09:32.647 --> 09:34.480
-Room 3.
-Wow.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.815
And you, Zeke's grandma?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.984
-Room 9.
-That's so far.

09:38.136 --> 09:40.227
Gene, tell me where
the parade's gonna go today.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.821
Well, we're gonna start
over here by the bookcase.

09:41.973 --> 09:44.082
We're gonna run around the room,
and then we're gonna stop.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.917
It should take
about three hours.

09:46.069 --> 09:48.311
Good news. The cream of tartar
was just hiding,

09:48.330 --> 09:50.255
so we can make biscuits
from scratch.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.073
-How's the chopping coming?
-Pretty good.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.908
You got to line 'em up just so,

09:54.002 --> 09:55.760
and then... hi-ya!

09:55.912 --> 09:57.320
-Oh.
-That's the best one so far.

09:57.339 --> 09:59.155
Oh, my God. Those should
really be in the oven.

09:59.174 --> 10:01.415
-Here, let me take that.
-Hey, I was just...

10:01.435 --> 10:02.917
You don't say "hi-ya" at all?

10:03.011 --> 10:04.344
Uh, you know what?

10:04.438 --> 10:05.604
Louise, why don't I chop
the rest of these?

10:05.755 --> 10:07.180
We can use a couple
of the ones you chopped.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.107
-(sighs)
-Crap. I gotta preheat the oven.

10:09.258 --> 10:11.184
Louise, watch out.
Sorry, I need to get through.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.111
-And there's Thankszilla.
-What? Huh?

10:13.338 --> 10:16.172
Nothing. I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom.

10:16.265 --> 10:18.191
-I'll let you know how it goes.
-Okay, great.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.693
Come out of your room
and go join your friends.

10:20.862 --> 10:22.937
I repeat, go join your friends.

10:23.031 --> 10:25.123
I'm not leaving
until Gary calls.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.867
Gary, Gary, Gary.
Eh, I give up.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.036
What? No, no giving up.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.038
-Tell me more about Gary.
-I'll tell you.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.040
He's a big-shot
tanning salon owner

10:34.134 --> 10:35.875
who won't visit his mother
on Thanksgiving

10:35.969 --> 10:37.861
even though he lives
ten minutes away!

10:37.879 --> 10:39.863
And he changed
his Netflix password.

10:39.881 --> 10:41.214
That's terrible.

10:41.366 --> 10:42.974
Why won't Gary visit you?

10:43.126 --> 10:44.792
Well, this one would tell you

10:44.811 --> 10:46.703
it's because
I'm a mean old lady.

10:46.796 --> 10:47.812
What? No.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.706
-That's not true.
-No, it is.

10:49.799 --> 10:51.132
You'd be a mean old lady, too,

10:51.151 --> 10:52.876
if your kids didn't visit you

10:52.894 --> 10:54.060
and you're shivering
all the time

10:54.154 --> 10:56.045
because it's freezing in here!

10:56.064 --> 10:58.882
Just wait, Linda.
It'll happen to you, too.

10:58.900 --> 10:59.991
No, it won't.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.734
It is chilly in here, though.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.569
Oh, my God,
it's already happening!

11:03.722 --> 11:05.664
Oh, Bob, I'm gonna be
a grumpy old lady,

11:05.815 --> 11:07.148
and you probably will, too.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.725
What are... what are you
talking about?

11:08.818 --> 11:09.909
The kids aren't gonna visit us

11:10.061 --> 11:11.318
when we're in an old folks' home

11:11.487 --> 11:12.912
'cause we'll be grumpy and cold.

11:13.064 --> 11:15.156
Okay, that-that might not
be a today problem.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.067
How are you doing in there?
Is Louise helping you?

11:18.161 --> 11:20.403
"Help" is a strong word,
but yeah.

11:20.496 --> 11:21.846
I mean, wait a minute. She was.

11:21.998 --> 11:23.014
She might have left.

11:23.241 --> 11:24.331
Oh, my God, see?

11:24.426 --> 11:25.909
They don't want to be with us.

11:26.002 --> 11:27.352
It's already happening. (groans)

11:27.579 --> 11:29.854
She just went to the bathroom,
I think. She's coming back.

11:30.006 --> 11:31.097
You're keeping it simple,
right, Bob?

11:31.249 --> 11:32.598
You're not going crazy in there?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.341
Simple-ish.

11:34.436 --> 11:36.269
Bob, if Louise comes back in,
take it extra easy with her.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.679
We want our kids to visit us
when we live here.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.440
We still can't afford it,
but I'll be...

11:40.534 --> 11:43.276
easy like Sunday morning--
you know, Thursday morning.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.870
I'm leaving. I'm gonna go
arrest somebody else's mom

11:46.097 --> 11:47.188
and pretend it's you.

11:47.282 --> 11:49.523
Bob, I got to go.
Get Louise, but go easy.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.267
All right, I need everyone
to imagine

11:51.286 --> 11:52.785
we're Shriners
driving tiny cars.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.770
Beep-beep!

11:53.863 --> 11:55.788
-Louise!
-Uh-oh. He found me.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.031
-Hey, Dad.
-We're Shrining.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.883
I was totally headed
to the kitchen,

11:59.035 --> 12:01.035
but now I got to drive
this tiny car.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.296
Yeah, but maybe you can,
um, come back.

12:03.448 --> 12:06.132
We'll definitely keep
having fun like we were before

12:06.284 --> 12:08.284
and, uh, maybe even more fun.

12:08.303 --> 12:10.395
I mean, I'd love to,
but there's that rule

12:10.622 --> 12:13.898
that you can't have less than
four Shriners cars in a parade.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.808
Shriners three cannot be.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.403
Just waiting on those other
tiny cars. (chuckles)

12:18.630 --> 12:19.571
TINA:
Here I come.

12:19.798 --> 12:21.481
Look at all these smiling faces.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.741
I-I-I got to go.

12:22.968 --> 12:24.391
Also, you got to go,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.487
because there's a lot of things
unwatched right now.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.080
Ugh. Fine. I'm coming.

12:29.232 --> 12:32.066
I don't even know why
he wants me in there anyway.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.585
Apparently, I'm not doing
anything right.

12:33.736 --> 12:35.995
-(Zeke and Tina grunt)
-Uh-oh. Shriner pileup.

12:36.072 --> 12:38.831
But if he kicks me out,
then I'm free.

12:38.984 --> 12:40.908
Yes! I'm going to be
such a bad cook

12:40.927 --> 12:44.170
that Thankszilla will banish me
from Kitchenland in no time.

12:44.322 --> 12:46.931
-Ha!
-Okay, time to Shrine, Gene!

12:47.158 --> 12:49.058
Feel that tiny car energy!

12:53.181 --> 12:54.497
Okay, time to baste the breasts.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.332
Do you want me
to leave you guys alone?

12:56.351 --> 12:57.517
It's actually
a really important job, Louise.

12:57.685 --> 12:59.593
We use the baster
to suck up the juices

12:59.613 --> 13:01.838
and then evenly
distribute them like so.

13:01.856 --> 13:03.615
Got it. Let me take
a whack at this.

13:03.842 --> 13:04.966
Oh. Okay.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.600
Oh, whoops.
(chuckles) Did I get it?

13:06.694 --> 13:09.954
Uh, nope, but I'm easy
like Thursday morning.

13:10.106 --> 13:12.439
Oops.
Missed the meat completely.

13:12.534 --> 13:14.867
Oh, that must be
so frustrating for you.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.519
Why don't you try again?

13:16.612 --> 13:20.465
I'm-I'm very relaxed about
all this cooking stuff.

13:20.616 --> 13:21.691
Okay.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.134
Whoa. Missed again.

13:23.286 --> 13:25.878
Boy, you should need
a license for this thing.

13:26.031 --> 13:27.713
Good job. That's done.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.882
Okay, uh, let's, uh, keep going.

13:30.051 --> 13:31.810
Uh, look at all
that stuff we're making.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.719
-Over there.
-Oh, great.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.705
Just closing the oven.

13:35.798 --> 13:37.298
Oh, and now I'm being told

13:37.392 --> 13:39.300
some really cool marching band
is ready to perform.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.653
-Good for them.
-Two, three, four.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.062
(makes trumpet sounds)

13:43.214 --> 13:44.989
Just imagine
the thousands of hours

13:45.141 --> 13:46.899
they must have practiced
for this very day.

13:47.052 --> 13:49.735
Are you kidding me?
They got a flag waver?

13:49.888 --> 13:51.054
Hot damn.

13:51.147 --> 13:53.147
Wow, if I was watching this,
I'd be impressed.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.833
And what the huh?

13:55.060 --> 13:57.818
-A gymnastics squad?
-(both grunting)

13:57.838 --> 14:00.930
All right, how about you stir
the cranberry sauce?

14:00.932 --> 14:02.065
I'm gonna use this guy.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.675
This is good
for stirring, right?

14:03.902 --> 14:05.068
Nope. Nope. Nope.

14:05.086 --> 14:06.511
Ooh, this one's bigger.

14:06.662 --> 14:07.828
Let's use you.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.422
Uh, that wooden spoon
looks like fun.

14:09.574 --> 14:11.332
And now, no parade
can be complete

14:11.409 --> 14:13.834
without a song from
a hit Broadway musical.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.578
Get ready for some singing!

14:15.597 --> 14:17.246
One, two, three, four!

14:17.265 --> 14:20.249
♪<i> Here we are on Broadway</i> ♪

14:20.268 --> 14:23.769
♪<i> It's a street but also</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:36.599
(weak cheering)

14:36.692 --> 14:37.876
Oh, God. We bombed.

14:38.027 --> 14:39.118
They're just giving us
grandparent claps.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.270
To be fair, we told them
this was a parade,

14:41.364 --> 14:43.197
and we didn't have
any floats or balloons.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.032
-And very little parading.
-It's true.

14:45.126 --> 14:46.533
They could probably
press charges.

14:46.628 --> 14:48.035
(gasps) Floats and balloons.
Gosh darn it,

14:48.129 --> 14:49.779
we need to do
floats and balloons somehow.

14:49.839 --> 14:50.871
It's Thanksgiving, and we're

14:51.040 --> 14:52.390
supposed to be doing
the giving part.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.784
The Garfield balloon himself
couldn't have said it better.

14:54.877 --> 14:56.135
Uh, guess what. We're not done.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.046
Actually, this was the finale
before the finale.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.790
-The pre-finale.
-The pre-nale.

15:00.883 --> 15:03.735
So don't go anywhere.
This parade will be right back.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.052
With floats and balloons.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.261
-MAN: Oh, okay.
-WOMAN: All right.

15:06.263 --> 15:07.721
We don't have
any of those things.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.148
We're definitely getting sued.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.910
Okay, so just keep stirring
the green beans like this

15:12.061 --> 15:14.078
so they don't burn,
but also you want

15:14.230 --> 15:16.973
to keep them spread out
so they cook evenly.

15:17.066 --> 15:19.584
Got it. So, like this, Papa?

15:19.735 --> 15:20.810
Is this good?

15:20.903 --> 15:22.420
Is this spread out enough?

15:22.571 --> 15:23.570
Mm-hmm. Kind of.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.314
I hadn't thought
of doing it that way.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.409
Just a big pile
all the way over to the side.

15:28.486 --> 15:31.487
Oh, that cutting board's
gonna fall. Go catch it.

15:31.506 --> 15:34.340
How about we race to where
your friends are, huh?

15:34.492 --> 15:36.175
I bet you a dollar I'm faster.

15:36.327 --> 15:37.435
Gary could beat you.

15:37.586 --> 15:38.752
He keeps in shape.

15:38.846 --> 15:40.587
Unlike Mr. Orange Soda
over here.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.847
Eats like a five-year-old.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.499
-(Bosco groans)
-That's it!

15:43.518 --> 15:47.837
Lillian, stop talking about your
precious Gary who isn't here.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.096
Sergeant Bosco is here

15:49.115 --> 15:50.931
visiting you,
bringing you flowers.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.675
And you've got friends
down the hall somehow,

15:52.768 --> 15:53.952
though it's hard to imagine.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.328
So why don't you spend
Thanksgiving

15:55.513 --> 15:57.622
with people who want
to spend it with you?

15:57.849 --> 15:59.015
I'm gonna go find my kids.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.349
And the only reason
they won't visit me

16:00.443 --> 16:01.626
in a nursing home
when I'm old is

16:01.853 --> 16:04.111
'cause I won't be able
to afford to live in one.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.296
Happy Thanksgiving.

16:05.523 --> 16:07.523
I don't know where
she's getting any of that.

16:07.542 --> 16:08.708
I'm on your side.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.376
Okay, the turkey needs
a couple more minutes.

16:10.528 --> 16:12.453
Same with the brussels.
And you're holding the pickles

16:12.530 --> 16:14.305
above the mashed potatoes.
Uh, I'll just take that.

16:14.457 --> 16:15.974
Yeah, if you don't like flavor.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.883
Looks like some pickle juice
might have fallen in.

16:18.036 --> 16:19.143
Hopefully not.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.794
The sweet potato casserole
should be ready.

16:20.888 --> 16:22.705
And now it's time
to brown the marshmallows.

16:22.798 --> 16:23.797
Oh, yes!

16:23.891 --> 16:25.558
The fire gun. Let's do this.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.393
Captain Casserole
reporting for duty.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.137
Oh, uh, it's just that we only
get one shot at this, Louise,

16:30.156 --> 16:31.972
and if we don't get it right,
it's ruined,

16:31.992 --> 16:33.899
so I-I'd better just do it.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.827
And also, you know,
it's not that fun.

16:35.978 --> 16:37.662
What? No, I can be
really careful!

16:37.889 --> 16:41.057
Dad, come on. I was being bad
at cooking on purpose.

16:41.075 --> 16:42.333
Let me do it, please.

16:42.485 --> 16:45.152
You-you... you were
being bad on purpose?

16:45.246 --> 16:47.079
Yes. So you would kick me out.

16:47.232 --> 16:48.489
You wanted me to kick you out?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.916
Yeah. I did before,
but now I don't.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.235
Why would you do that?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.570
Let's talk about it after
you give me that thing.

16:54.663 --> 16:55.680
No, definitely not.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.164
-I'm doing this.
-(yells in frustration)

16:57.258 --> 16:58.908
Since you don't want
to be here so badly

16:59.001 --> 17:02.094
that you'd purposely mess up the
most beautiful meal of the year.

17:02.171 --> 17:04.505
-None of us wanted
to be in here.
-What?

17:04.599 --> 17:06.024
The only reason I'm here
at all is because

17:06.100 --> 17:07.525
I had the softest hand fart.

17:07.752 --> 17:09.009
I-I don't know what that means,

17:09.087 --> 17:10.194
but I'm just gonna finish
everything else myself.

17:10.346 --> 17:12.104
Fine! That's clearly
how you wanted it

17:12.257 --> 17:14.440
from the beginning,
you Thankszilla.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.993
-Bye. Bye!
-Bye.

17:17.945 --> 17:19.278
I imagined that door slamming.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.289
I'm just gonna say it. Slam!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.270
This is beautiful. You kids.

17:27.363 --> 17:29.047
Uh, don't blow your nose
on the toilet paper.

17:29.198 --> 17:30.773
-We need it for the float.
-Oh.

17:30.866 --> 17:32.291
This is supposed to be a float?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.534
If you really squint
and then shut your eyes.

17:33.628 --> 17:36.054
Louise, you're not helping
in the kitchen?

17:36.281 --> 17:37.780
Nope. I'm back.
What are we doing?

17:37.799 --> 17:39.298
We're aiming for the moon
is what we're doing.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.134
Or at least to get that one guy
to stop snoring at us.

17:42.287 --> 17:44.637
Hi, turkey.
It's just me in here now.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.381
God, you're even more beautiful
than you were five minutes ago.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.308
(in high-pitched voice):
Yeah, because you cooked me
perfectly

17:49.402 --> 17:51.885
and you're a great chef
and a great father

17:51.905 --> 17:53.905
and also unconventionally
handsome.

17:54.056 --> 17:56.632
(in normal voice):
Thanks. Uh, you didn't
have to say all that.

17:56.651 --> 17:58.743
(in burly voice):
Hey, I wasn't even
gonna be a dish,

17:58.894 --> 18:00.727
and now look at me.
Thank you.

18:00.805 --> 18:02.580
(in normal voice):
You're welcome,
brussels sprouts.

18:02.731 --> 18:05.658
I do very much enjoy cooking
Thanksgiving dinner.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.159
(in childlike voice):
And you're so good at it.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.828
(in normal voice):
Thanks, green beans.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.162
But honestly, I-I might not be

18:10.256 --> 18:14.074
the easiest to be around
in the kitchen on T-Day.

18:14.168 --> 18:15.501
(in high-pitched voice):
Are you kidding?

18:15.653 --> 18:17.911
I love being in the kitchen
with you on T-Day, Bob.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.338
And I love calling it T-Day.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.248
(in normal voice):
I-I don't know,
mashed potatoes.

18:21.342 --> 18:22.842
I feel like maybe you guys
are just kind of

18:22.936 --> 18:24.343
telling me what I want to hear.

18:24.495 --> 18:26.253
(in Southern accent):
No, we love you.
You're the best.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.940
Leave your family, Bob.
We'll run away together.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.833
(in normal accent):
I mean, that might be nice

18:30.926 --> 18:32.335
for a little while, stuffing,

18:32.428 --> 18:34.687
but I don't want
to run away with food.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.840
(in high-pitched voice):
You should.
We could make you happy, Bob.

18:37.859 --> 18:38.950
(in normal voice):
This is getting weird.

18:39.177 --> 18:40.509
I-I think I'd better
go talk to Louise.

18:40.603 --> 18:42.269
I'm just gonna put some foil
over you guys real quick.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.788
(in high-pitched voice):
No, no, no!

18:43.939 --> 18:45.606
(in normal voice):
Shh. No, it's okay.

18:45.683 --> 18:47.107
You guys need to stay warm.
(screams in high-pitched voice)

18:47.201 --> 18:48.868
Is this collection
of inflated rubber gloves

18:49.078 --> 18:50.853
the best parade balloon ever?

18:50.872 --> 18:52.797
No, but is it a parade balloon?

18:52.948 --> 18:54.206
-Probably.
-Hi, guys.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.950
-Louise, can we talk?
-Sorry, we're busy.

18:57.044 --> 18:59.211
-Just for a sec.
-Uh, I'm in the float zone, Dad,

18:59.364 --> 19:02.365
so unless you're a float
or a balloon, I don't see you.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.124
Can't tell.
Can't tell if we got there,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.477
but gosh darn it,
it's too late to stop now,

19:06.629 --> 19:07.812
'cause we're rolling!

19:07.963 --> 19:09.296
Bye, Dad. Hee-yah!

19:09.465 --> 19:12.132
How about a totally sincere
round of applause for the float?

19:12.152 --> 19:15.227
The theme is:
a mountain of medical supplies.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.697
Look at all the things
they got on that thing.

19:17.806 --> 19:19.048
(murmuring)

19:19.066 --> 19:20.307
And how about
these glove balloons, huh?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.218
Eat your heart out,
giant Snoopy.

19:22.311 --> 19:23.995
I'm still light-headed
from blowing these up.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.664
Oh, so full of air,
those balloons.

19:26.815 --> 19:29.575
Uh, and I'm another balloon.

19:29.727 --> 19:31.060
Do what?

19:31.078 --> 19:32.837
What's that balloon
supposed to be?

19:33.064 --> 19:35.173
-Oh, um...
-Ignore him.

19:35.324 --> 19:37.341
He's not really in the parade.
He's the chef.

19:37.493 --> 19:39.177
The mean chef who works alone.

19:39.328 --> 19:42.496
Um, my balloon is
a-a character named...

19:42.515 --> 19:43.756
Sorry, Louise.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.591
Sorry Louise? Is that Pixar?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.092
What the hell is this?

19:47.187 --> 19:48.911
Aw, Lillian, you left your room.

19:48.930 --> 19:50.095
Kind of regret it now.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.764
-Hey, Lillian.
-Hi, Ernie.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.006
What's this crap show?

19:53.100 --> 19:55.676
The TV's broken,
and then I had a great nap.

19:55.770 --> 19:56.919
Louise, hey.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.270
I-I really want
to say something.

19:58.423 --> 20:00.773
Uh, I'm sorry I was
a little bit of a Thankszilla.

20:00.925 --> 20:03.108
I really did want you
to be in the kitchen with me

20:03.277 --> 20:05.261
and maybe even to teach you
a few things.

20:05.354 --> 20:07.613
You know, I pictured us
bustling around in there,

20:07.765 --> 20:09.281
high-fiving with spatulas,

20:09.434 --> 20:12.952
but I was way too much of a cook
and not enough of a dad.

20:13.104 --> 20:16.939
(sighs) Well, I guess
I was kind of a jerk, too.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.716
Sorry. For what it's worth,

20:18.867 --> 20:21.886
every other day of the year,
you're a pretty great dad.

20:22.113 --> 20:23.870
Though you're kind of
a monster on Easter, too.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.130
And Russian May Day.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.873
Do parades normally
talk this much?

20:26.968 --> 20:29.969
Let's give it up for the
Sorry Louise balloon over here.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.045
Late entry. Crowd favorite.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.547
-Wow.
-(murmuring)

20:33.566 --> 20:35.215
What an amazing parade.
You loved it.

20:35.309 --> 20:37.126
We gave back. It counts.
You're welcome.

20:37.144 --> 20:39.737
Uh-oh, the wind's blowing
this balloon off course.

20:39.964 --> 20:41.313
Look out.

20:41.466 --> 20:44.800
Oh, I was wondering where
all the medical supplies went.

20:44.893 --> 20:47.745
(pleased murmuring)

20:47.972 --> 20:49.638
God, I freaking love
Thanksgiving.

20:49.732 --> 20:50.823
Aw.

20:50.975 --> 20:52.232
Hey, Louise,
there's one more thing

20:52.252 --> 20:53.642
I need your help with
in the kitchen.

20:53.661 --> 20:54.585
What's that?

20:54.812 --> 20:55.978
(yelling)

20:56.071 --> 20:57.421
