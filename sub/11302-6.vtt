00:06.674 --> 00:08.090
Are you serious?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.135
You saw Burt Reynolds in Garrison?

00:10.218 --> 00:11.887
Yep. Saw him at the gas station.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.015
I rolled up and I said, "Hey,
Bandit. Watch out for them smokies."

00:15.098 --> 00:17.100
He gave me
the double-gun fingers,

00:17.184 --> 00:18.435
and went...

00:18.519 --> 00:20.146
Hopped in his car and sped off.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.398
Run on, Bandit, run.

00:24.817 --> 00:28.654
Man, Burt Reynolds has
the best mustache ever.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.030
Says who?

00:32.825 --> 00:36.244
Hey, I saw Taylor Swift
in a bar in Buffalo once.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.580
- Did you talk to her?
- Yeah, boy.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.041
I went right up to her. I
said, "Hey, I'm Colt Bennett."

00:41.124 --> 00:42.542
She said, "Nice to meet you, Colt.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.920
This is my friend, Leo. He's
gonna throw you out of here."

00:45.003 --> 00:47.130
Hey, still counts, though.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.841
Yeah, boy.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.802
I saw Paul Newman in a butcher
shop in Denver once.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.473
Bought a big rib eye. Bone in.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.849
That's a movie star.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.895
Yeah.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.271
Here's your burgers.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.480
Oh.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.109
Yeah, what is it this time?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.110
Vegetable, turkey or chicken?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.237
Never thought I'd root for chicken.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.490
That's your grass-fed beef.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.327
You've eaten nothing but veggie burgers
in here for the last couple of weeks.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.495
I figured you deserved a treat.

01:19.537 --> 01:22.832
Either a treat or she's
trying to kill you off faster. Ha!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.167
Mmm.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.338
I wasn't this happy on
the day you were born.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.467
- Hey, Colt.
- Oh, hey, Abby.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.634
- Hi, Abby.
- Hey, guys.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.928
Can I, uh, talk to you for a sec?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.347
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.101
Don't worry, Colt. I'll watch your beer.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.061
Oh.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.940
Always leaving us for a girl, huh?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.358
Don't talk to me.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.992
I'm... really sorry
about the other night.

01:57.679 --> 01:59.315
I probably shouldn't
have mixed whiskey

01:59.327 --> 02:00.871
with nine more whiskeys.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.124
Oh, it happens.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.001
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.365
Next time you're gonna try to
kiss me, give me a heads up.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.255
Oh, I can turn the charm down.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.465
I can't turn it off, but
I can turn it down.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.720
What are you talking about?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.764
Oh...

02:18.847 --> 02:21.767
Okay, the old "I was
too drunk to remember."

02:21.850 --> 02:24.061
- Okay. Been there.
- No.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.063
FYI, that does not hold up in court.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.692
I did not try to kiss you.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.526
Uh... yeah, you did.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.903
You were on the couch

02:32.986 --> 02:35.447
and I come over and I
said, "Are you okay?"

02:35.530 --> 02:37.658
And then you were like...

02:39.076 --> 02:40.618
And I was like, "Whoa!"

02:40.703 --> 02:42.245
And you were like, "Aw!"

02:42.329 --> 02:43.831
And I was like, "Uh..."

02:43.914 --> 02:46.166
And then you were like...

02:47.167 --> 02:49.044
Are you serious? I tried to kiss you?

02:49.502 --> 02:50.503
Yeah.

02:51.379 --> 02:55.926
But, I mean, in your defense... this.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.511
You know, here's the thing.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.306
You didn't respect my
relationship with Heather,

03:01.389 --> 03:05.685
which, I've been told by
someone, is "super not cool."

03:05.769 --> 03:07.938
Wait, who was it? Oh, that was you!

03:08.688 --> 03:11.649
Oh, I guess that makes
you the hypochondriac.

03:13.736 --> 03:16.113
"Hypocrite." It's hypocrite.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.617
Okay, I can make up words, too.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.662
I can't believe I did that to Kenny.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.915
All right, look...

03:26.999 --> 03:29.417
it's not a big deal, okay?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.044
No one's judging you...

03:31.128 --> 03:32.212
except me.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.007
And God.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.051
- Hey, Colt. Hey.
- Oh, hey, Heather.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.302
Oh, hi, Mrs. Phillips.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.974
Do you have a designated driver or
do you need me to call somebody?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.060
Thanks, I'm fine.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.686
Yeah, that's exactly what you said

03:48.771 --> 03:51.439
right before you blew chow on
my favorite Forever 21 shirt.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.609
Okay, I need a drink.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.237
Hey, Abby, make good choices.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.822
God is watching.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.869
- How you doing, Heather?
- I'm bored.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.120
Do you wanna go have sex in your car?

04:05.203 --> 04:06.496
Hell yeah!

04:06.579 --> 04:08.749
Ah! Shit!

04:08.832 --> 04:09.917
I don't have a car.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.334
What about the bathroom?

04:11.418 --> 04:14.087
Ah, no doors on the stalls.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.213
Been caught in there.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.966
Me, too!

04:18.050 --> 04:20.385
- We're perfect for each other.
- Yeah.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.638
You know... there is one other option.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.099
You ever do it in a trailer?

04:26.183 --> 04:28.936
Are you kidding? I was
conceived in a trailer.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.900
I lost my virginity in a trailer.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.940
I had my first girl-on-girl in
a trailer.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.193
I had my first
girl-on-girl in a trailer!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.197
Girl, why are we still talking? Come on!

05:47.764 --> 05:50.392
And you're sure that your mom
doesn't care that we're in here?

05:50.475 --> 05:53.061
In my 34 years, I've
never heard my mother say,

05:53.145 --> 05:55.647
"Do not have sex with
Heather in my trailer."

05:55.730 --> 05:57.732
So, we are good.

05:57.815 --> 06:01.111
Hey, how about some mood lighting?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.406
Ooh, you are so romantic.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.074
You know it.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.558
All right, where do you wanna bone?

06:08.994 --> 06:10.554
How about you do me on the kitchenette?

06:10.996 --> 06:12.580
"Bone" appÃ©tit.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.293
Oh, this is great.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.696
I was hoping I'd see you tonight,

06:17.710 --> 06:19.963
get myself a little early
birthday present.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.215
Oh, you got a birthday comin' up?

06:22.299 --> 06:23.383
Yeah, on Monday.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.842
So what're you gettin' me?

06:25.928 --> 06:27.805
Start unwrapping.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.940
- You are so hot.
- Mmm.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.441
I want you.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.567
Hey.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.070
I know you've done it in
a trailer before, but...

06:43.153 --> 06:45.989
you ever do it on a kitchenette?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.491
I feel like my answer might
just disappoint you.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.380
- Is something burning?
- Yeah, it is.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.757
Oh, is that a good thing?

07:08.178 --> 07:09.721
Oh, my God!

07:09.804 --> 07:11.764
- Oh, my God, Heather!
- No, there's a fire!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.891
What? Whoa!

07:13.976 --> 07:15.477
Oh, shit!

07:18.063 --> 07:19.564
- Oh!
- Keep going.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.067
Oh!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.403
Here, Colt!

07:25.487 --> 07:27.364
Oh. Thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.448
Oh, shit!

07:40.335 --> 07:42.170
So...

07:42.254 --> 07:43.588
where were we?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.428
What the hell happened here?

07:51.346 --> 07:55.517
Well, as it turns out, uh, Heather
here is a bit of a trailer...

07:56.434 --> 07:57.519
enthusiast.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.772
And when I told her that you had an
Airstream, she got real excited.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.608
So I brought her out
here to show her and...

08:03.691 --> 08:06.819
as we're approaching the
trailer, she says, "I smell smoke."

08:06.903 --> 08:08.696
I smell bullshit.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.074
What you smell is a hero.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.202
'Cause I ran headlong into
this aluminum inferno of death.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.405
And then what happened, Colt?

08:16.413 --> 08:19.749
You two took off your clothes and
you... you threw them into the fire?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.461
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Bennett.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.173
Ah, it's all right,
sweetie. As long as you're okay.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.924
Yeah, that's the important thing.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.178
I mean, I not only saved your
home, I saved an actual human life.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.139
There's that bullshit again.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.100
Could be worse.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.311
Shouldn't take more than
a week to repair the damage

08:39.394 --> 08:40.687
and air it out from the smoke.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.732
I suppose I
could stay with my friend, Barb.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.058
Although she has
that annoying wiener dog

08:47.084 --> 08:48.845
Dusty that keeps humping my leg.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.112
"It means he likes you."

08:50.197 --> 08:52.407
It means you didn't
train your damn dog, Barb.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.845
You should just stay at the house, Ma.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.829
I don't think that's a good idea.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.665
Why? I mean, you're there all
the time, anyway. Right, Dad?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.294
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.754
You already got a
spare toothbrush there,

09:06.838 --> 09:09.882
some clothes and that little
kit you do your nails with.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.551
Oh, uh, actually, that's mine.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.097
But you're welcome to use it.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.932
You sure you wanna date my sister?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.519
So what do you think, Beau?

09:21.603 --> 09:22.812
Stay at the house?

09:23.521 --> 09:25.398
I think it's settled.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.400
We'll have even numbers again.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.111
Two boys, two girls.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.698
You are insane.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.493
There's no way Johnnie Walker
kicks Jack Daniels' ass.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.214
Why not?

09:39.239 --> 09:41.396
'Cause Johnnie
Walker's a weak-ass bitch.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.709
Walking around with
that top hat and cane.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.837
Please, man. He's from Scotland.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.040
Them boys know how to fight.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.258
You ever seen Braveheart?

09:53.468 --> 09:54.927
You don't mess with Mel Gibson.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.181
Especially if you're Jewish.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.937
Hey, you know who'd
kick both their asses?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.273
Jose Cuervo.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.027
Yeah, every time I mess
with him, he kicks my ass.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.739
Rooster, I need to talk to your brother.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.617
Sweet. I'll be in the
kitchen, pretending not to listen.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.705
Okay, is this about the
"Hillary" bumper sticker on your tractor?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.791
'Cause if it is,
that was Rooster's idea.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.225
Don't offer up my house to anybody

10:32.250 --> 10:33.865
without asking me first.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.594
Okay.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.722
Uh, well, it wasn't anybody, it was Mom.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.349
Especially your mother.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.603
If I'da wanted her here,
I'd have asked her myself.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.788
That's right, Colt. You idiot.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.568
Listen, I... I
didn't think it was a big deal,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.778
especially since you guys
are getting along so good.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.489
We are and that's why I
don't wanna change anything.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.413
All right. Well, I'm
sorry, I screwed up.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.996
He didn't mean
it. Kick his ass, Daddy.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.418
- Hey, Colt.
- Hi, Mom.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.877
Uh...

11:09.961 --> 11:12.338
Dad's real excited you're
here. I'm gonna step on inside.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.469
Are you sure about this?

11:17.552 --> 11:19.262
Nope. Are you?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.638
No.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.765
All right, then. Come on in.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.783
And welcome back
to Cook-a-doodle-do

11:30.808 --> 11:32.799
with your host Rooster Bennett.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.989
Our next question
comes from Tim in Arapahoe.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.962
"Dear Rooster, how do you get

11:38.987 --> 11:41.725
your scrambled eggs so light and fluffy?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.705
P.S. Your beard is super kick-ass."

11:47.624 --> 11:49.584
Well, thank you,
Tim. And here's the deal.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.694
Making scrambled eggs

11:51.719 --> 11:53.904
is like making love
to a beautiful woman.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.091
You wanna be gentle, you
wanna take your time,

11:57.174 --> 11:59.802
you wanna make it
last, but most importantly...

11:59.886 --> 12:01.304
you wanna use a shit-ton of butter.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.141
Hey.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.345
So that's why there's a tub
of margarine in your room.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.898
Why the hell are you
talking to yourself?

12:11.981 --> 12:14.859
Well, you were gone for a
long time and Dad doesn't talk.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.235
Got to adapt or die.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.155
Oh, where is Mom and Dad?

12:19.238 --> 12:20.657
I don't know, man. I'm
not keeping track.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.300
I'm just making eggs and doing my show.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.993
Oh. Word to the wise,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.495
next week is my
south-of-the-border episode,

12:26.579 --> 12:27.914
"Hello, Chorizo."

12:29.999 --> 12:31.584
Let me ask you something.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.308
Should I get a birthday
gift for Heather?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.827
Why the hell would you do that?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.200
She's not your girlfriend. You're
just having sex with her.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.928
It's like, did I get a baby
shower gift for Pregnant Linda?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.451
Of course not, man. It's not my kid.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.635
I'm just having sex with her.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.810
When it comes to stuff like
this... I have a system.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.645
It's too late to stop you, isn't it?

12:50.728 --> 12:52.368
I like to break up

12:52.393 --> 12:54.172
with a girl right after Thanksgiving.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.026
You know, avoid all
that holiday gift trouble.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.153
Then, the day after Christmas,

12:59.236 --> 13:01.197
I pick up some girl whose
asshole boyfriend dumped her

13:01.280 --> 13:02.531
to avoid getting her a gift.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.994
Now, tricky part is... is getting
out before Valentine's Day.

13:07.078 --> 13:10.164
So what I like to do is start
a fight at the Super Bowl party.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.250
You know, something like...

13:13.335 --> 13:15.044
"Hey, your sister get some new titties?"

13:20.758 --> 13:22.335
You're the worst person I've ever met.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.410
Thank you.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.387
Good morning, boys.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.598
- Morning, Mom.
- Hey, Ma.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.101
Hey, where's Dad? Is he still sleeping?

13:30.184 --> 13:31.018
Oh, God, no.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.544
He went to work
extra early this morning.

13:33.605 --> 13:34.981
I think he's avoiding me.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.024
Really? What's your secret?

13:40.027 --> 13:41.696
I think I should just go to Barb's.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.281
Let that little dog mess
around on my leg for a while,

13:44.366 --> 13:45.950
maybe it'll lose interest.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.290
To be fair, Dad's not gonna show

13:49.315 --> 13:51.188
as much enthusiasm as Barb's dog.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.834
But...

13:54.917 --> 13:56.477
wouldn't it be kind of weird if he did?

13:59.046 --> 14:01.674
I just feel like he
doesn't want me around.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.087
Mom, I had the same problem with Dad

14:04.112 --> 14:05.244
when I came back.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.346
Don't worry, he'll warm up to you in...

14:09.974 --> 14:11.476
I'll let you know.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.480
Where the hell is all the margarine?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.123
Oh. Hey, Dad, I was thinking...

14:34.957 --> 14:36.709
Will you stop?

14:36.793 --> 14:37.877
Stop thinking.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.296
Stop talking.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.092
How about I meet you
halfway and talk without thinking?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.639
You know, Colt, I had a long day.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.933
All I wanna do is sit down...

14:52.016 --> 14:53.100
and watch the game.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.271
Beau, is that you?

14:57.354 --> 14:59.023
I need to talk to you.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.823
Are you happy?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.034
I ain't been happy in years, Dad.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.745
You taught me well.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.083
Oh! Look at that. Touchdown.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.334
Have fun talking to Mom.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.136
- Maggie?
- Hey.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.848
What are you doing?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.643
Do you really think candles
are a wise choice

15:35.727 --> 15:37.437
based on your recent history?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.472
Look, I... I know we both have

15:41.496 --> 15:43.591
trepidations about me staying here.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.904
I just thought... maybe
we could have some fun.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.156
Like what?

15:50.241 --> 15:53.244
I don't know. We used to
like to go dancing together.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.082
That's true.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.252
So... why don't we go dancing?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.337
I thought you had to work tonight.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
I got Maria to cover for me.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.218
I wanted to spend the night with you.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.891
This next question is very important.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.728
Are the boys coming?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.482
It is date night.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.441
I don't know, Mags.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.069
I've had a long day and...

16:28.195 --> 16:30.072
I don't even remember how to dance.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.283
Come on. Shh. Just dance.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.041
There you go.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.793
You see, you remember how.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.505
Smiling?

16:45.588 --> 16:47.840
Is Beau Bennett smiling?

16:48.591 --> 16:51.010
When you dance this
good, you can't help but smile.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.272
This is nice.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.443
It is nice.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.694
Thank you.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.196
I know what I'm gonna do.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.615
I'm gonna take a shower.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.826
That would probably be good.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.619
You wanna join me?

17:20.080 --> 17:21.874
- Save water.
- Yeah.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.545
Bennett takes the snap. He drops back.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.255
He's got a receiver
open over the middle.

17:27.279 --> 17:27.819
He throws!

17:27.880 --> 17:28.923
Touchdown!

17:31.092 --> 17:32.218
What's that?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.970
There's a flag on the play!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.937
Well, but it's declined 'cause it's just

17:35.962 --> 17:37.247
for excessive handsomeness.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.684
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey, Abby.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.893
What you doing here?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.842
Well, I heard your
mom needed new drapes,

17:42.867 --> 17:44.420
so Kenny got these from his hotel.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.982
Can't use them 'cause they
don't match the carpet.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.403
Just to be clear, Kenny's
carpet don't match his...

17:51.487 --> 17:54.073
Don't. No, don't, don't, don't...

17:54.156 --> 17:56.242
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.161
Listen, can I ask you something?

18:00.747 --> 18:04.041
Look, Abby, no matter
how many times you ask,

18:04.125 --> 18:05.835
I'm not gonna make out with you.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.796
That's actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

18:09.881 --> 18:10.923
Oh.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.260
Did you tell anyone
about the other night?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.805
- I put it on Facebook.
- What?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.249
- I snapchatted it.
- No, you didn't.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.307
- I tweeted it.
- No!

18:20.391 --> 18:21.475
No, I didn't do it. No, of course not.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.227
- I would never do something like that.
- Okay.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.311
My lips are sealed.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.939
Unless you try to pry 'em
open with your tongue again.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.903
Just, Kenny was acting weird.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.279
You know, we went to
dinner the other night

18:33.362 --> 18:34.488
and when the waitress
came up and she said,

18:34.571 --> 18:36.490
"Hi, I'm Stephanie. I'm
gonna be your waitress,"

18:36.573 --> 18:37.903
he didn't say, "Hi, I'm Kenny,

18:37.928 --> 18:39.434
and I'm gonna be your customer."

18:39.493 --> 18:41.078
It's his favorite joke.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.123
Oh... okay.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.833
So, these drapes aren't for my mom.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.002
They're to keep me quiet.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.586
They're hush drapes.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.964
Yeah.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.717
Well, I appreciate you
being so cool about this.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.678
Yeah.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.639
Hey, you know what? I
got a question for you.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.642
Listen, no matter how
many times you ask me,

19:02.725 --> 19:04.226
I'm not gonna make out with you.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.687
Come on.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.147
Well, uh, seriously, though.

19:08.230 --> 19:12.484
All right, so, if you're
in, like, a casual relationship...

19:12.568 --> 19:14.528
- Mmm-hmm.
- are you obligated

19:14.611 --> 19:16.655
to get someone a birthday present?

19:16.739 --> 19:18.575
Yes, I think you should
buy Heather a birthday gift.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.702
No, come on. No, this
is not what you think.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.204
I mean, we're just having
fun, fooling around.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.831
Rooster said I didn't
have to get her a present.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.042
Ooh. Taking relationship
advice from that guy?

19:28.125 --> 19:30.586
He dumped my friend Sharon
four days before Christmas.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.630
Oh, that's cutting it close.

19:32.714 --> 19:33.798
She must have been hot.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.134
Just don't make the same
mistake you did with me.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.635
What are you talking about?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.221
I gave presents all the time.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.806
Yeah. For Christmas one year,

19:41.889 --> 19:44.100
you got me a Broncos
T-shirt from the gas station.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.476
Whoa, whoa.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.085
That was a commemorative

19:47.110 --> 19:49.462
John Elway retirement shirt jersey.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.772
Limited edition.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.108
Exclusive to Chevron.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.612
Must be why there
was only triple-XLs left.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.184
Yeah, the same size as my love for you.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.492
And what about that birthday?

20:01.575 --> 20:03.744
When you made me that
coupon book for free massages

20:03.828 --> 20:04.871
because you clearly forgot

20:04.954 --> 20:06.998
- to get me anything else.
- Look, I did not forget.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.030
On the way to dinner,

20:08.055 --> 20:09.816
you asked me how to spell "massages."

20:09.876 --> 20:11.961
It's a complicated word.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.880
It's real close to "messages."

20:13.963 --> 20:15.715
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, look.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.133
Seriously, though,
what should I get her?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.468
Hmm... what would someone her age want?

20:20.386 --> 20:23.014
Ooh! You could take her to the
mall and get her ears pierced.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.181
Shut up.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.017
And then you guys
could get a Happy Meal.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.770
Very funny.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.104
Hey, um...

20:31.355 --> 20:32.398
do you wanna make out?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.565
Get out. No!

20:37.528 --> 20:39.989
What's a bag of weed
doing in the vegetable crisper?

20:40.072 --> 20:43.034
Well, I told Dad it was kale.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.786
That way I knew he'd never touch it.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.933
And how do you know it isn't, Mother?

20:48.873 --> 20:51.333
'Cause I grow kale in my garden.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.513
Maybe next time I come by the bar,

20:54.538 --> 20:55.904
we'll smoke a salad together.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.760
Hey, Ma.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.971
Your trailer is as good as new.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.347
Actually, it's better than new.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.516
I bought you a little gift.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.742
My way of saying I'm sorry,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.460
but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.521
Is it a toaster?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.605
Come on. How did you know that?

21:13.689 --> 21:16.567
'Cause my credit card had
a charge for a toaster.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.720
- Brisket's ready.
- Ooh!

21:19.736 --> 21:21.112
Oh, so is the salad.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.117
Good, I can use it to garnish my meat.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.038
All right. You don't
have to eat any salad.

21:29.121 --> 21:33.125
I'm not gonna ruin our first
family dinner in ten years.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.087
It's just red meat
twice this week, Beau.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.005
Next Sunday we can smoke a tofu.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.133
Or we can just smoke some kale.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.427
Dad's brisket.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.221
That's the best meal
on the entire planet.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.514
And I know 'cause I've
lived in a lot of big cities.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.101
Orlando and Saskatchewan.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.477
I get the end piece.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.020
Uh, then I get the bigger one.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.230
The hell you do.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.857
I should get the other
one then 'cause I'm older.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.817
Well, I'm better looking.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.861
I'm not willing to concede that...

22:01.112 --> 22:02.713
but I also don't see how that's related.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.284
Thank you for this wonderful
meal we're about to eat.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.703
It's been a long
time since the four of us

22:10.728 --> 22:12.230
sat down like this together...

22:13.415 --> 22:15.792
and I'm grateful to you for
allowing that to happen.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.233
May the sun shine, the rain fall,

22:19.258 --> 22:21.656
the grass grow, and
the herd stay healthy.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.261
- Amen.
- Amen.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.387
- Mom!
- Mom!

22:26.470 --> 22:29.223
Whatever, I gave you both life.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.728
Wow.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.397
What a beautiful, clear night.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.650
God, I can see every star.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.236
And every government satellite.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.033
I bet they're looking at us right now.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.748
Well, come on, let's give 'em a show.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.669
Ah, Maggie...

23:01.588 --> 23:03.274
You know, you coming back here

23:03.300 --> 23:05.491
turned out to be a pretty good thing.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.053
It did.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.055
I was worried for nothing.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.306
Me, too.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.851
What do you say we do it permanently?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.604
What?

23:20.399 --> 23:21.858
Move back in, Mags.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.654
Okay, probably had enough of this.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.489
I'm serious.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.392
I mean, there's no reason you should

23:30.417 --> 23:31.351
move back to that Airstream

23:31.410 --> 23:33.120
when you ought to be living here.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.706
Beau, I'm not sure that...

23:35.789 --> 23:36.873
Listen to me.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.461
We've been going in this
direction for a while now.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.589
I mean, things have been really
good since Colt came back.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.261
Didn't think I'd ever hear
myself saying that.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.600
I mean, you're right. Things
have been really great, so...

23:55.601 --> 23:57.811
let's not do anything to screw it up.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.856
I've been afraid of that, too, but...

24:01.898 --> 24:03.866
you know, these last few days have been

24:03.892 --> 24:05.761
some of the best days we've ever had.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.780
Yeah, but, just because they've
been great lately,

24:08.864 --> 24:11.617
uh, it doesn't mean that everything
between us is fixed.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.036
So move in and we'll fix it together.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.621
Oh, it's not that simple.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.374
Well, it can be.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.084
It's either a yes or a no.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.587
Oh, see, that's how
it is with you, Beau.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.714
Your whole world is black and white.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.549
So is that a yes or a no?

24:33.847 --> 24:35.599
You gonna make me do this?

24:36.808 --> 24:37.809
Yes.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.646
Then no.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.574
Did you get all that?

25:01.667 --> 25:03.001
Oh!

25:03.794 --> 25:04.836
Shit.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.463
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey!

25:09.091 --> 25:10.092
The baby's sleeping.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.763
- You have a baby?
- Yeah, I didn't tell you?

25:14.846 --> 25:16.167
That's not a deal breaker, is it?

25:16.723 --> 25:17.724
I mean...

25:19.060 --> 25:21.145
Well...

25:21.228 --> 25:23.814
- Colt, I'm messing with you.
- Oh.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.982
It's my sister's. I
just babysit every Sunday

25:26.067 --> 25:28.194
so she and my ex-husband
can have a conjugal visit.

25:31.155 --> 25:35.826
Uh, so... your sister
and your ex-husband

25:35.909 --> 25:37.703
who's in jail for...

25:37.786 --> 25:40.539
Oh, my God, you're so gullible.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.335
- Please sit down.
- Oh, yeah.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.919
So, what's going on?

25:46.002 --> 25:47.421
Um...

25:47.504 --> 25:51.925
uh, I just wanted to come by and
wish you an early happy birthday.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.886
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.347
You got any big plans?

25:56.930 --> 25:59.390
Yeah, I'm going out to
Telluride to do the birthday circuit.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.603
Free appetizers at
Applebee's, free dinner at Denny's,

26:02.686 --> 26:04.026
free dessert at TGI Fridays and then

26:04.051 --> 26:05.463
free drinks all night long at Chili's.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.441
Oh, and I get a Bloomin'
Onion from Outback.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.110
I just don't know if we'll have time.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.405
They give you free drinks
at Chili's on your birthday?

26:13.489 --> 26:15.657
Oh, no, my friend Lizzie works there.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.909
She's dating the manager. He's married.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.914
She gets away with whatever
she wants.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.998
Okay. Well, hey, I, uh...

26:23.081 --> 26:24.916
I wanted to stop by and give you this.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.211
Oh, my God, Colt.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.546
You did not need to do that.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.298
Apparently, I did.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.384
This is my favorite store.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.552
They usually give you a balloon, though.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.096
Yeah, yeah, they were all out.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.724
I'm gonna rip 'em a new one on Yelp.

26:44.228 --> 26:47.189
Oh, my God, Colt.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.065
That's beautiful.

26:49.150 --> 26:49.988
Well, keep digging.

26:50.012 --> 26:51.467
There's a coupon book in there.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.908
"One free message"?

26:57.991 --> 27:00.869
That's supposed to be... Damn it!

27:04.039 --> 27:06.208
"One free lingerie removal."

27:06.292 --> 27:08.752
Yeah. Well, that's not "limit
one per customer."

27:09.545 --> 27:11.213
So, is it my birthday or yours?

27:12.673 --> 27:14.341
But, really, I...

27:14.425 --> 27:16.009
I appreciate you thinking of me.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.178
Yeah.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.555
I didn't know we were at this stage.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.098
Stage?

27:22.808 --> 27:24.393
Yeah, of our relationship.

27:25.977 --> 27:26.978
Relationship?

27:27.938 --> 27:30.482
Yeah, I totally wasn't expecting a gift.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.152
Uh...

27:35.529 --> 27:37.364
Hey, did your sister
get some new titties?

27:44.913 --> 27:46.248
Oh.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.713
You dead?

27:56.883 --> 27:58.427
Okay.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.511
What are you doin' up?

28:00.804 --> 28:02.681
Mom went back to the Airstream.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.349
Oh...

28:04.374 --> 28:05.958
Well, what happened?

28:06.893 --> 28:09.020
I asked her to move in.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.105
She said no.

28:13.817 --> 28:14.901
You wanna talk about it?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.069
Nope.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.492
Dad...

28:22.451 --> 28:25.871
I've been here through... all
the stuff with you guys and...

28:26.497 --> 28:27.975
I know it makes you

28:28.000 --> 28:30.191
uncomfortable to
hear, but I do love you.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.544
And I love Mom.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.234
And nothing would make me happier

28:35.260 --> 28:36.614
than to see you guys work it out.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.137
But if that's not gonna happen...

28:42.221 --> 28:44.502
I'd like to at least see you
guys stop hurting each other.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.311
Well, that just seems
to be me and your mom.

28:52.606 --> 28:54.691
Then maybe it's time to move on.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.860
She's my wife, son.

28:58.529 --> 28:59.613
Yeah.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.325
Well, we're here for you,
whatever you decide to do.

29:04.368 --> 29:07.413
Or... at least I am. I don't
know where the fuck Colt is.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.126
I don't know what to do.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.005
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...

29:19.300 --> 29:20.740
I think you could use a little kale.
