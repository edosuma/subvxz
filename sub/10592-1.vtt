[Woman, Indian Accent]
Mrs. Greenslade,
thank you for waiting.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.710
I've consulted with my manager...

01:25.794 --> 01:28.463
Now if you'll just stay
on the phone for a moment
and talk to me.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.506
Just talk to me.
Of course.

01:30.591 --> 01:35.887
I'm not even clear- I mean,
I don't actually understand
what it is I'm trying to order.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.931
Is wireless the same as Wi-Fi?

01:39.016 --> 01:42.602
And what do either of them
have to do with broadband?

01:42.686 --> 01:45.688
Mrs. Greenslade,
since the account
is not in your name,

01:45.773 --> 01:47.732
before we can make
any changes,

01:47.816 --> 01:50.526
we need to verify details
with the account holder.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.237
Can I please speak
to the account holder?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.489
What?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.241
I'm asking if I can talk
to the account holder.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.285
Before we can make
any changes...

01:59.369 --> 02:01.162
You can't talk to him, no.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.790
He's dead.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.417
He died of a heart attack.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.086
There's only me.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.881
Mrs. Greenslade,
since the account
is not in your name...

[Man]
Lord Justice Walton requests
the pleasure of our company.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.889
- Had you forgotten?
- I hate retirement parties.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.433
Crap cheese, crap wine.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.435
Endless speeches.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.395
Why do people do that?

02:26.480 --> 02:31.150
Nobody... Nobody ever said
about a retirement party,
you know,

02:31.235 --> 02:32.777
"Well, this is great.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.737
I can't wait to have
one of my own."

02:34.822 --> 02:36.364
It'll be yours one day.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.366
One day very soon.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.660
You've been saying that
for years.
[Chuckles]

02:40.744 --> 02:44.705
[Man] It was often said
of Stancombe that his bark
was worse than his bite.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.374
But as the recipient of both,

02:46.458 --> 02:51.254
I can testify to the fact
that neither actually
required surgery.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.588

02:52.673 --> 02:56.050
His relationship with
all his pupils...

02:56.134 --> 02:58.052
was founded on respect.

02:58.136 --> 03:02.890
We respected him,
and he respected that.
[All Chuckle]

03:02.975 --> 03:06.894
Indeed, to this day,
I recall his response...

03:06.979 --> 03:09.647
to the unwelcome news
that I would trans...

This is the day.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.758

03:37.843 --> 03:42.221
So, as I say,
what you're looking at here
is very competitively priced.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.557
You won't see better
for your Grey Pound.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.309
Another little feature...

03:46.393 --> 03:48.895

03:48.979 --> 03:51.939

to help you get around.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.942
And over here, a panic button.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.654
In case of a sudden fall,
brings the warden running.
[Chuckles]

03:59.740 --> 04:01.657
What if we fell
somewhere else?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.409
Sorry?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.786
It's just we might not manage
to plan our sudden fall...

04:05.913 --> 04:09.373
in the exact corner
where the button is.
Yeah, but-

04:09.458 --> 04:12.710
And would it be possible
to have the rail going through
the middle of the room...

04:12.836 --> 04:15.963
Darling.
To help us get across,
as well as around.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.925
Um, c-c-could we have
a moment, please? Thank you.
Yeah.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.927
Thank you so much.

Thirty years
in the civil service,
and this is all we can afford.

W-W-Would it help
if I apologize again?

04:29.937 --> 04:30.978
No.

will be along shortly.

to get proper attention?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.082

04:51.166 --> 04:52.917
Not a single doctor
has come to see me.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.461
Now that's not quite true,
is it, Mrs. Donnelly?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.839
A doctor did try
and examine you,
and you sent him away.

04:58.924 --> 05:03.052
What, that one?
He can wash all he likes.
That color's not coming out.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.013
I want an English doctor.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.057
Oh, an English doctor.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.893
Why didn't you say so?
I'll get one right away.

to tell us anyway?

and canopied balconies
abound with opulent comfort.

09:52.050 --> 09:56.178
Indeed, the entire building
exudes historical ambience...

09:56.263 --> 10:02.184

back in time to the proud
tradition of the Raj."

35:51.942 --> 35:55.110

lowering the biscuit
into the tea...

and letting it
soak in there...

40:47.946 --> 40:52.866
Well, we played everything
together, and-and it stayed
like that for a few years.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.159
And then, um...

40:55.119 --> 40:58.121
And then one night, it, uh...

40:58.206 --> 41:01.041
it became something else.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.129
We had
a few months together.
We had that.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.424
And, um...
And then there was
a weekend in Udaipur...

41:09.509 --> 41:15.180
where... we were sitting
by a lake and watching
the sun go down.

41:15.265 --> 41:20.310
And, uh, I remember
thinking that I-I would
never be this happy again.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.396
[Chuckles]

41:22.480 --> 41:26.108
And... And I was right.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.861
Because, suddenly,
it was over.

41:28.945 --> 41:32.239
We'd fallen asleep,
and they found us.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.159
Well, it was bad enough
for me.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.496
But I knew who I was,
and I think
my family guessed.

41:39.581 --> 41:41.331
But for...

41:41.416 --> 41:46.670
for Manoj, the...
the disgrace was absolute.

41:46.754 --> 41:50.299
His father was fired.
His family was sent away,
all of them.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.053
And, uh,

41:55.138 --> 41:57.139
well, I don't know
what I could have done.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.933
But it should have been
more than nothing.

42:00.018 --> 42:03.103
I just-
I just let it happen.

I didn't put up
any kind of a fight. I...

42:09.027 --> 42:11.111
And then, um...

42:11.195 --> 42:13.906
Then I went back to England,
to-to-to university.

42:14.032 --> 42:19.953
And, uh, I always said,
you know, I'm going to go back.
I shall go back.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.583
And I never did.

42:25.501 --> 42:31.131
Until now.

So now that we are fully
operational, Mr. Maruthi,

43:50.003 --> 43:53.588
it is clear that,
with a small injection of funds
for the phase two development,

43:53.673 --> 43:57.718
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
can rise like a phoenix...

43:57.802 --> 43:59.845
to its previous state of glory.

I mean small

No. He's in his

54:24.094 --> 54:26.095
Why must you mock?

54:26.180 --> 54:27.972
I just want to
feel young again.

54:28.057 --> 54:33.686
To feel needed
as much as I need,
if only for one night.

54:33.771 --> 54:38.274
One wonderful night.

54:39.985 --> 54:42.195
Tell me you don't know
how that feels.

54:44.531 --> 54:47.325
Give me a minute
and then come and join me.

54:52.498 --> 54:54.290
[Sighs]

54:54.375 --> 54:56.417
Rejected again.

54:58.420 --> 55:03.424
Many years ago that man
over there gave me the most
extraordinary night of my life.

55:04.968 --> 55:08.221
To describe his bedroom skill
as technique would...

55:08.305 --> 55:12.016
- Those drinks not ready yet?
- They say patience
is passion tamed.

55:12.101 --> 55:14.560
- I'm Madge.
- Carol.

55:14.687 --> 55:17.230
And this is Norman.
How do you do?

55:17.314 --> 55:20.400
Carol. As in Christmas.

55:20.484 --> 55:23.069
- I suppose.
- Great.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.279
So what brings you
to Jaipur, Carol?

55:25.364 --> 55:28.157
Yes, Carol. What, uh...
What brings you to Jaipur?

55:28.242 --> 55:32.245
Actually, I've lived here
all my life. My father
worked for the foreign office.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.457
- You're very fit.
- Beg your pardon?

55:36.583 --> 55:41.421
- Oh, God.
- You look like you keep yourself
in good shape, physically.

55:41.505 --> 55:45.675
Well...
[Clears Throat]
I did join a gym last year.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.720
It cost a fortune,
and I didn't get any fitter.

55:48.804 --> 55:51.431
- Apparently,
you actually have to go.
- [Chuckles]

55:53.100 --> 55:55.059
Ah!
[Chuckles]

55:58.981 --> 56:03.401
So, um,
what do you do, Norman?

56:03.485 --> 56:04.610
- Me?
- Yes.

56:04.737 --> 56:06.279
Norman's in business.
Well, I... Yes.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.697
- What business?
- You tell her.

56:07.781 --> 56:09.031
Import-export.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.743
Although nowadays,
there's rather more
"ex" than "im."

56:11.827 --> 56:15.037
- If you know what I mean.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

56:16.915 --> 56:19.917
I have to go
and splash some water
on my face.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.836
Please, God,
I drown in it.

56:29.428 --> 56:32.555
Well, look.
It's been lovely chatting.
No, it hasn't.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.640
No, it hasn't.
But I really have to go.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.268
Look, Carol, Carol.

56:38.687 --> 56:41.522
Can we drop
all this pretense?

56:41.607 --> 56:44.275
Start again?

56:44.359 --> 56:47.153
I'm not charming.
I'm not good at repartee.
And...

56:50.574 --> 56:55.036
My name's Norman,
and I'm lonely.

56:56.163 --> 56:59.415
My name's Carol. So am I.

57:03.212 --> 57:04.587
[Chuckles]

57:06.298 --> 57:08.716
[Chattering]

57:10.177 --> 57:12.261
[Evelyn Narrating]
Day 22.

57:12.346 --> 57:17.517
Like Darwin's finches,
we are slowly adapting
to our environment.

57:19.436 --> 57:21.229
And when one does adapt,

57:21.313 --> 57:24.524
my God,
the riches that are available.

57:33.784 --> 57:37.703
There is no past
that we can bring back
by longing for it.

57:37.788 --> 57:42.375
Only a present that builds
and creates itself
as the past withdraws.

57:45.420 --> 57:48.256
Didn't sleep a wink last night.
The tap in there
never stopped dripping.

57:48.340 --> 57:51.050
Ah. I spoke to Young Wasim
about that.

57:51.134 --> 57:53.845
- What did he say?
- No idea. It was in Hindi.

57:56.682 --> 57:59.809
- I thought I might
fix it myself.
- You? When?

57:59.893 --> 58:02.228
Well, no time
like the present.

58:05.899 --> 58:08.901
Where is this? Where are we?

58:09.027 --> 58:11.112
Janta Colony, Kachchi Basti.
[Gasps]

58:12.155 --> 58:14.699
Well, what happened
to my usual route?

58:14.783 --> 58:16.450
Anokhi has invited you
to her home.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.121
Who's Anokhi?

58:20.205 --> 58:22.123
The one who brings
your food.

58:22.207 --> 58:24.250
She wants you to meet
her family.

58:37.931 --> 58:39.932
[Chattering]

58:42.728 --> 58:44.437
How soon can I leave?

58:44.521 --> 58:47.773
[Anokhi Speaking
Indian Language]

58:54.281 --> 58:56.282
She wants to thank you
for your kindness.

58:57.075 --> 58:59.285
I haven't been kind.

58:59.369 --> 59:01.287
You are the only one
that acknowledges her.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.468
[Indian Language]

59:20.933 --> 59:22.433
I'm not eating that.

59:22.517 --> 59:24.977
You will insult her
very deeply if you do not.

59:43.246 --> 59:44.705
It's good.

59:46.375 --> 59:48.334
[Chuckles]

59:49.378 --> 59:52.046
- Oh!
[Chuckles]
- [Metal Clanks]

59:52.130 --> 59:55.257
Get off there!
The little bastards!
Get off!

59:55.342 --> 59:57.385
Get up! Get 'em off there!

59:57.469 --> 59:59.387
Get 'em off me...

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.392
Ah.

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:06.811
I... I di...

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.815
I didn't know
they were playing. I...
[Chuckles]

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:14.110
Sorry.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:19.198
I'm sorry.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:23.869
Sorry.

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.711
How much for this piece?

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.338
One thousand rupees.
[Speaks Hindi]

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:36.090
Thank you.
No, no, no, no.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:40.386
Forgive me. Forgive me.
No, no. That's, um...
That's not how it works.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.221
Uh, sorry to butt in.

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:45.641
But, uh, you don't ask him
how much he wants.
You just tell him how much you'll pay.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:51.814
She'll give you, uh...
She'll give you 200.
Absolutely no more, final offer.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:54.108
One thousand rupees.
Pity.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.277
Walk away. Now walk away.
Oh, but...

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.070
I know what I'm doing.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.073
- The thing is
I really wanted to buy that.
- He'll come after us.

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.285
Do you think so?
Absolutely.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.620
This is how
the game is played.
Just keep on walking.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.999
He's playing it very cool,
but he'll come.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.001
Ah.
[Chuckles]

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:16.881
He's playing it
very, very, um, cool.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:21.802
850, 900, 950, 1,000.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.721
Thank you.
Sure.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.639
You'll get him next time.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.434
Why are you carrying a tap?

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.604
You see, what I think,
and of course,
I'm no expert,

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:35.649
is that the gland nut
has come away from
the spindle,

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.194
so it needs to be
tightened and resealed.

01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:44.658
The washer valve has eroded.

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:49.830
Yeah. Uh, well, uh, yeah.
It-It-It could be that too.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:53.584
- Um, uh, can you fix it?
- Not cheaply.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:56.796
Not cheaply.
Most expensively indeed.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.844
I was in a...
I was in a tuk-tuk
the other day.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.514
It didn't seem to be taking
the usual route
back to the hotel.

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:09.558
It turned out
the driver had decided
to take me to another hotel...

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.393
he was sure I'd prefer.
[Chuckles]

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.896
[Chuckles]

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:16.899
Of course, one wants to believe
that he genuinely
had my welfare at heart...

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.485
and that it wasn't
run by his brother-in-law.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:23.906
[Chuckles]
One wants to trust in general,
don't you think?

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.991
But you never really know.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.077
[Banging]

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:31.664
I met my husband the day
the fair came to town.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.791
My girlfriend and I
went on the carousel.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.670
Her horse was fine,
but when the ride started,

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:42.049
I felt mine give a little,
as if it might collapse.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:44.218
And then suddenly,
I felt these arms
around me,

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:48.389
and a voice in my ear said,
"Just trust me," and I did.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.724
Without question,
till the day he died.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.018
[Hammering]

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.857
How wonderful.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.235
The sale of our flat
went through last week.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.904
I had to sell it
to pay off Hugh's debts.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:09.702
I've been forced
to get a job out here,
which, in fact, I love.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:14.707
Because even
at Sonny's rates,
I couldn't make ends meet.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:18.460
Not after what happened
to our life savings.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:22.381
So, no, you're right.
You never know.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:48.532
[Chattering]

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.326
Off you go then.
Excuse me.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:53.078
Off you go. Go home! Go, go!

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.357
[Soft Chattering]
[Phone Rings]

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:25.444
[Graham] But I've already
filled this form in.
I've given it to you, many times.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.363
[Man]
There is a process.

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:31.200
You are making an inquiry,
and for each inquiry,
a form must be filled in.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.703
But it's the same inquiry
I make every day.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:37.790
And, therefore,
the same form you must fill in.

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.343
Mrs. Ainslie.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:57.351
How can you bear this country?
What do you see that I don't?

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:02.106
Oh, the light, colors.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.899
Smiles.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:06.402
[Chuckles]
And...

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:10.781
And the way people see life
as a... as a... as a privilege
and-and not a right.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.533
It-It teaches me something.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:19.581
Is that milk pasteurized?
Yes, ma'am.
Very, very "posturized."

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.626
But that's not true, is it?
You're lying to me
just now because...

01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:26.338
No, no. It'll be fine.
Thank you.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:35.055
It was a pleasant surprise
to see you out and about.

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:39.184
Was it?
Yes, yes. It's progress,
I think.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.354
I was going to the bank.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.649
To the bank.

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:48.152
Not that there's any reason
to think that
something has changed,

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:50.362
but our daughter, Laura,
she did promise,

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.532
and one tries to remain
optimistic.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.451
[Chuckles]

01:05:55.535 --> 01:06:00.456
Otherwise...

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:06.086
Actually,
I wasn't going to the bank.
I was looking for you.

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:10.174
In fact, I think
I've been looking for you
for a very long time.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.676
Mrs. Ainslie.
Jean.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.471
I'm gay.

01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:23.979
As in... happy?

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.152
Yes, yes.
Yes, of course.
I see. I see.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:35.949
Thank you.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.618
What for?

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:41.497
For averting
my complete humiliation.

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:47.044
As I said,
this country's driving me mad.

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:51.590
Shall we go?

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.885
Anything?
[Douglas]
Not yet.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.807
- How about now?
- One second.

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.393
[Water Running]

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.812
Oh!
[Chuckles]

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.772
- Good Lord!
- What?

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.566
- Listen.
- [Water Running]

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:11.610
And now...
[Water Stops]

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:14.405
No drip!

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:17.950
- Oh!
- [Laughing]

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.411
No drip! High five.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:23.664
No, sorry. I don't know why
I did that. I've never
done it before in my life.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.916
Mrs. Ainslie.
Darling.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.961
How are you?
Did you have a good day?

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.754
Well, let me tell you
about ours.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.172
Your husband of many a year,

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.966
who's never known
which end of a hammer to use,

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.385
has finally managed...
We have to get out of here.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:39.263
- What did you say?
- I can't stay in this country
a moment longer.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.806
[Douglas]
Why?
Excuse me.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.892
Pick a reason. Pick ten.
The climate, the squalor.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.936
The poverty.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.480
This whole trip
is a grotesque fantasy.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.024
- It's time we went home.
- Who's paying for the tickets?

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:54.111
Look at us. A group
of self-deluding old fossils...

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:58.907
traipsing around as if
we're on some bloody gap year,
humiliating ourselves.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:02.453
Not us. We couldn't pay.

01:23:29.046 --> 01:23:31.798
He's had a peaceful life
and, uh,

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.052
he's never forgotten me.

01:23:37.388 --> 01:23:39.138
That's what he said.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.474
Hmm.
[Chuckles]

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:48.147
All that time,
I thought I'd sentenced him
to a life of shame.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.859
But I was the one in prison.

01:23:55.406 --> 01:23:57.281
But not anymore.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.744
Top of the mountain.

01:24:01.829 --> 01:24:03.788
[Birds Chirping]

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.164
How was the night?

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.501
Rather special.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.273
[Sighs]

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:17.528
[Evelyn]
Oh! You are back again.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.492
It's been quite
a remarkable night all around.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:25.703
First you tell me your news.

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.998
First you tell me your news
and th...

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:57.902
[Evelyn Narrating]
Day 45.
Of course, it was inevitable.

01:25:59.947 --> 01:26:02.740
Put enough old people
in the same place,

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.785
it won't be too long
before one of them goes.

01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:13.167
Graham died
of a heart condition
which he'd had for many years.

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:18.839
So he knew before he left
that he would not
be coming back.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.470
He wanted to die in India.

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:27.098
He just didn't want
any of us to know.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:37.275
He kept his promise
to take me to Udaipur.

01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:44.740
Manoj wanted him to have
a Hindu burial there,
by the lake.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:47.243
At the place
they had visited together.

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:54.375
Not a holy place.
Although, for them,
perhaps it was.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:01.215
It takes a long time
for a body to be consumed.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:05.636
Many hours for the mourners
to remember their dead.

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:07.763
[Indian Language]

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:11.392
The fire must be lit at dawn,

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:16.105
and by sunset,
there must be
nothing left but ash.

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:27.533
Is it our friend
we are grieving for,

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:29.869
whose life we knew so little?

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.585
Or is it our own loss
that we are mourning?

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:46.218
Have we traveled far enough
that we can allow
our tears to fall?

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:09.367
[Chattering]

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:13.496
[Madge]
When someone dies,
you think about your own life.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.209
And I don't want to
grow older.

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:21.253
I don't want to be
condescended to.

01:28:21.338 --> 01:28:25.299
To become marginalized
and ignored by society.

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:32.598
I don't want to be the first person
they let off the plane
in a hostage crisis.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.767
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:41.399
Hello.
Oh, hello.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:46.112
I wondered where you'd been.
We're all having a drink up top.

01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:49.865
I went to see Gaurika,
Manoj's wife.

01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:52.118
Why?

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:56.706
I wanted to ask her
how much she knew.

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:59.834
The answer is
that she knew everything.

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:03.379
That he loved another man,
that he always would.

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:06.215
He told her when the marriage
was arranged.

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:10.928
They had no secrets
from each other. None.

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:15.349
That's right, isn't it?

01:29:16.727 --> 01:29:18.811
That has to be right.

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:26.193
It made me realize
how much I'd failed Hugh.

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:31.407
What's the use of a marriage
when nothing is shared?

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:38.080
[Jean]
Mrs. Greenslade.

01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:40.791
Might I have
my husband back now?

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:43.794
Douglas?

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:48.340
Forgive me.
Sorry. Sorry.

01:29:48.467 --> 01:29:51.427
Forgive me.
Sorry.

01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:58.893
She was upset.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:01.645
Oh, spare me your explanation.
Do you think I'm jealous?

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:04.815
I don't see why else
you would've
embarrassed me and Evelyn.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.526
You seem to be doing
a perfectly good job
of embarrassing yourself.

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:10.112
Can you imagine
how ghastly it is
for everyone...

01:30:10.197 --> 01:30:15.659
to see you mooning around
after that simpering,
doe-eyed ex-housewife,

01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:17.661
taking advantage
of her loneliness?

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:21.081
God, can you hear yourself?
Can you?

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:25.377
Do you have any idea
what a terrible person
you've become?

01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:28.506
All you give out
is this endless negativity.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:31.634
A refusal to see
any kind of light and joy,

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:33.803
even when it's staring you
in the face.

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:39.016
And a desperate need
to squash any sign of happiness
in me or-or-or anyone else.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.061
It's a wonder I don't
fling myself at the first
kind word or gesture...

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.896
that comes my way,
but I don't!

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.984
O-O-Out of some sense
of dried up loyalty and respect.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:51.570
Neither of which
I ever bloody get in return.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:04.375
I checked my e-mails.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.045
There's one from Laura.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.175
[Madge]
Are you all right?

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.219
I just want a glass of water.

01:31:16.555 --> 01:31:18.639
That was a gin and tonic.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:23.894
- I know that now.
- What's happened?

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:29.525
Ah. Good evening,
the Ainslies.
How are you both?

01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:33.904
We're particularly well.
Douglas, tell them
our news.

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:39.034
We're going home.

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:44.957
And so now I would ask you
to loosen the strings
on your purse, Mr. Maruthi,

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:46.750
and-and do it most rapidly.

01:31:46.835 --> 01:31:48.419
So that phase two development...

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:52.590
of The Best Exotic
Marigold Hotel can begin
with immediate effect.

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.049
Mrs. Donnelly, I believe.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:56.135
Now if you please be
following me
to the ground floor...

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:58.262
How are things at the hotel?
Mr. Maruthi.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:01.473
Oh, they're better.
They're getting better.

01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:04.643
You see?
Profound satisfaction.

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:08.731
Such is the inevitable result
of a prolonged stay
at the Marigold Hotel.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:11.317
What are those men doing?
Working for me, Mr. Maruthi.

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:14.612
To create a home
for the elderly
so wonderful...

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:17.281
that they will simply
refuse to die.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.491
Stare death in the face
and say...

01:32:19.618 --> 01:32:22.828
[Men Chattering]
What are those men doing?

01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:27.708
Mummyji, what is going on here?

01:32:27.834 --> 01:32:31.378
[Mrs. Kapoor]
Sonny, I have spoken to your brothers.
They have decided to sell the hotel.

01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:33.839
These men are here
to value the building.
[Speaks Hindi]

01:32:33.924 --> 01:32:36.508
They are valuing the land.
My brothers don't care
about the building.

01:32:36.635 --> 01:32:39.219
They will knock it down.
Well, they could wait
for a month...

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.180
for it to fall down
of its own accord, huh?

01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:44.516
[Sonny]
You joke, Mummyji, but inside,
I know you're not laughing.

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:48.145
You don't want to see
this dream destroyed.
Send these people away.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.565
No, beta, it's too late.

01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:54.193
[Sonny]
Mummyji, please, if I could just
show you these figures...

01:32:54.277 --> 01:32:58.489
- I don't need to see them.
I know they don't add up.
- [Beeps]

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:02.409
There is still time to turn
things around. With a small
injection of funds, we can...

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:04.703
Who is going to be
trusting you
with this money, huh?

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:08.749
You, who can't even
run a chai stand?
Just like your father.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:11.210
Do I remind you
of him so much?

01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:14.004
Is that why
you must be so cruel to me?

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:16.006
You think I'm being cruel?

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.509
You loved my father,
and he loved this hotel.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:21.929
You want to end up
a broken man like him?

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:25.516
Just say good-bye to all this
and come back to Delhi with me.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.851
Your life will be much easier.

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:32.064
No. Not easier, Mummyji.
Smaller.

01:33:36.486 --> 01:33:38.362
[Sighs]

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:43.701
Mrs. Donnelly.
Uh, can I help you?

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:48.872
It depends.
Do you know how
to work a computer?

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:53.460
Mrs. Ainslie said she knew
an address where I could
get some things I need.

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:57.965
Some biscuits.
She said I could
get them "on the line"?

01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:00.884
Well, I wish you luck.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:36.170
The whole thing is actually
tremendously exciting.

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:40.049
Not just getting on the plane,
but getting on the plane
and turning left.

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:41.675
[Chuckles]

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.177
Turning left?

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:45.387
First class.

01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:49.683
And home in time for
our 40th wedding
anniversary.

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:53.312
We haven't quite decided
how to mark the occasion.

01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:55.939
Perhaps a minute of silence.

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:02.946
[Chuckles]

01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:07.326
[Printer Whirring]

01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:19.630
Yes. Okay. Okay, sir.

01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:23.509
I've confirmed
your appointment for tomorrow
morning at 10:00. Thank you.

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:27.262
Now, Mr. Maruthi...
Mrs. Donnelly, please.

01:35:27.347 --> 01:35:29.640
Call me Bhanuprakash.

01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:36.647
[Norman]
Too small. One large
should fit us all, I think.

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:44.822
Actually,
I think I'll walk.

01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:47.658
Apparently,
they're getting ready
for some festival.

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:50.869
Perhaps y-you'd like one of us
to accompany you?

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:54.581
- [Madge]
I'm happy to walk with you.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:58.335
I'm so pleased about
your daughter's success
and that it's all worked out so well.

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:00.838
Thank you.

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:19.481
[Evelyn]
Darling? Darling.

01:36:19.566 --> 01:36:21.984
It's me.

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:24.319
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:30.492
Oh, no. No, sorry.
I didn't even think
about the time.

01:36:30.577 --> 01:36:34.830
How are you?
And Polly and the...
How are the boys?

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:40.252
Oh. Good. Good.
I'm glad you've been
reading it.

01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:44.214
Yes. Yes, I made
a few very good friends.

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:49.970
No, I'm fine.
Of course I am.
I'm fine.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:51.722
[Man]
Time's up in there,
madam.

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:54.558
Um, I think the money's
running out.

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:57.477
So I'll call you again,
um, at another time.

01:36:58.855 --> 01:37:03.150
Okay. Bye, darling.
I'll call you again soon. Bye.

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:13.827
Sonny.

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:15.579
Sonny!

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:18.874
Mrs. Greenslade,
where are the others?

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:22.336
They're on their way back
to the hotel.
What's the matter?

01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:26.757
I-I wanted to warn you
of the most momentous changes
that are occurring.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:29.343
Absolutely all of them,
without question,
for the very positive.

01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:31.929
What are you talking about?

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:35.933
I am delighted to announce
the closing of The Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel.

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:40.062
And the joyful return
of all its inhabitants
to their home country.

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:42.856
What?

01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:45.442
Please relax in the knowledge
that your journey home...

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:47.653
has been arranged
and paid for by the hotel.

01:37:47.737 --> 01:37:51.156
Our journey here was arranged
and paid for by the hotel
and look how that went.

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:53.325
I'd rather
walk back to England.

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:55.953
[Norman]
I'd rather
not go back at all.

01:37:56.037 --> 01:37:58.247
Go back where?

01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:00.249
And for myself,
the news is even better.

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:02.459
I shall be moving to Delhi
to live with my mother.

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:05.545
And, furthermore,
I shall be wed to a most
suitable person of her choice,

01:38:05.672 --> 01:38:09.007
whom I look forward very much
to meeting before I spend
the rest of my life with her.

01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:14.137
Didn't you have
a girlfriend?
She is my girlfriend no longer.

01:51:03.949 --> 01:51:07.618
It's not possible, madam.
Two persons, no cases.
One person and cases.

01:51:07.703 --> 01:51:11.789
Well, how about if I give you
something else?
I'll give you my watch.

01:51:11.874 --> 01:51:15.168
Sure. Thanks.
But still it's not possible, madam.

01:51:15.252 --> 01:51:18.046
We'll get another flight.
Let's go back to the hotel
and leave in the morning.

01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:20.840
No.
Jean, he can't do it.
You heard what he said.

01:51:20.924 --> 01:51:23.551
- He can do one person
and cases.
- Yeah, but...

01:51:23.635 --> 01:51:27.221
Could fate find
a better way to tell us
what we need to hear?

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:32.143
- Which is what?
- That it's over.

01:51:32.227 --> 01:51:34.479
That it's been over
for a long, long time.

01:51:34.563 --> 01:51:37.523
This is not the time
to talk about this.
Let's wait until we get home.

01:51:37.608 --> 01:51:39.859
I have to go, Douglas.

01:51:41.653 --> 01:51:42.779
I won't let you.

01:51:42.863 --> 01:51:46.949
No. You'll come after me.

You'll chase me to the airport,
tell me everything will be fine.

But please don't.

01:51:53.665 --> 01:51:55.917
Because the truth is...

01:51:56.001 --> 01:51:58.920
The truth is we both deserve
more than we've had.

And it's just because
of your...

I let him take me
to his brother's hotel.

Wh-Which turned out to be
less of a hotel
and more of a...

01:54:38.038 --> 01:54:41.165
more of a brothel really.

01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:44.877
And they...
And they gave me this pipe,
said it was apple tobacco.

01:54:44.962 --> 01:54:48.881

helped probably.
