00:00.280 --> 00:03.240
Previously on Elementary:
If you’re looking for Sherlock,

00:03.240 --> 00:04.190
he’s downstairs.
Okay.

00:04.390 --> 00:05.810
HOLMES:His name is Harlan Emple.

00:05.810 --> 00:07.440
He is the Rachel P. Hanson
Professor

00:07.440 --> 00:09.270
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

00:09.270 --> 00:12.390
What I don’t get is why
he isn’t wearing a shirt.

00:12.390 --> 00:14.150
HOLMES:Every great thinker
has a process, Watson.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.850
In Harlan’s case,
he doesn’t like anything

00:15.850 --> 00:17.940
to come between him
and the numbers.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.520
If I wanted a distraction,
Watson,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.020
I’d pay another visit to Athena

00:21.020 --> 00:23.100
and thrust myself
into work more aerobic

00:23.100 --> 00:24.600
than crime scene
reconstruction.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.900
One of them led a killer
into this very apartment.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.060
He was never identified.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.270
Justice is like an orgasm.

00:31.270 --> 00:33.390
It can never come too late.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.810
HOLMES (over speaker):
Watson, wake up.

00:43.810 --> 00:44.940
(gasps)

00:44.940 --> 00:46.150
Who the hell are you?

00:46.150 --> 00:47.390
What do you mean, who am I?

00:47.390 --> 00:49.390
Is there something wrong
with the image?

00:49.390 --> 00:51.390
I mean, who is this stranger
in my bedroom

00:51.390 --> 00:53.400
with your face
strapped to his face?

00:53.400 --> 00:55.600
It’s Wiggins.

00:55.940 --> 00:57.560
I needed to speak with you,
and you’ve

00:57.560 --> 00:58.440
obviously turned off your phone.

00:58.940 --> 01:00.560
So you let a stranger
into our house?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.270
He’s not a stranger.
He’s done the odd task for me

01:03.270 --> 01:04.890
from time to time.
Thought you two had met.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.810
Perhaps you don’t recognize him
because his face is covered.

01:07.810 --> 01:10.650
And why does he keep waving
his hands around like that?

01:10.650 --> 01:12.730
He likes to pantomime
as his client speaks.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.100
I’m not the only person
he surrogates for, you see.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.650
He thinks it helps
sell the illusion.

01:17.650 --> 01:19.270
Ugh. Uh, what is
so important, anyway?

01:19.270 --> 01:22.350
I thought you were working
on a cold case with Athena.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.770
I was. We finished.

01:23.770 --> 01:24.480
Hi, Joan.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.560
With her help,
I solved the 1926 case

01:26.560 --> 01:30.350
of Fitzroy McPherson,
a scientist found dead

01:30.350 --> 01:31.980
in his apartment
in Sheepshead Bay.

01:31.980 --> 01:33.350
You may recall that the police

01:33.350 --> 01:34.730
thought he’d been beaten
to death

01:34.730 --> 01:35.980
because of the welts
on his back.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.890
Oh, yeah, I remember you
showing me the photos.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.890
I thought I recognized
the welts from somewhere,

01:39.890 --> 01:41.900
but I was never able
to place them until now.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.900
They’re the marks
of a lion’s mane jellyfish.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.980
ATHENA: Sheepshead Bay
is right by the beach.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.980
He must have gone
swimming that day.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.900
HOLMES:
Between the fact
that he made it home

01:50.900 --> 01:51.900
before succumbing
to the toxins

01:51.900 --> 01:54.060
and the fact
that lion’s mane stings

01:54.060 --> 01:55.020
aren’t typically fatal,

01:55.020 --> 01:57.890
no one, myself included,
had made the connection.

01:57.890 --> 02:00.150
I’m confused.
What part of the crime scene

02:00.150 --> 02:01.520
did you need Athena to reenact?

02:01.520 --> 02:04.600
We didn’t reenact anything.
We just had sex.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.940
I was having trouble
jogging my memory,

02:06.940 --> 02:08.810
and I needed
a potent distraction.

02:08.810 --> 02:09.889
Athena provided one.

02:09.889 --> 02:12.600
Okay, so you woke me up
because...?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.400
You remember my friend,
Harlan Emple,

02:14.400 --> 02:15.310
brilliant mathematician?

02:15.310 --> 02:17.060
He likes to work
in a state of undress?

02:17.060 --> 02:18.940
Yeah, of course I remember
Harlan. What about him?

02:18.940 --> 02:22.890
Well, he just called,
and he would like to hire us.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.560
Really appreciate
you guys coming.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.310
I-I didn’t know
who else to call.

02:28.310 --> 02:29.520
It’s Lily.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.440
Of course it is.
Who’s Lily?

02:31.440 --> 02:33.060
She’s one of
my doctoral students.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.520
She was supposed
to make the oral defense

02:34.520 --> 02:36.900
for her thesis this morning,
but she never showed up.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.600
And I tried calling her,
and she’s not answering.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.440
This morning.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.310
So that can’t be more
than, what,

02:42.310 --> 02:43.560
a couple of hours ago?

02:43.560 --> 02:45.150
Did you try
her family or friends?

02:45.150 --> 02:46.890
(sighs) I-I know
she has a roommate,

02:46.890 --> 02:50.890
and, uh, her family
is somewhere in California,

02:50.890 --> 02:52.520
but I don’t know them.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.440
I just called you.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.890
Because there could be
plenty of explanations.

02:55.890 --> 02:56.890
Family emergency.

02:56.890 --> 02:59.480
Or just that a thesis defense
is a lot of pressure.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.810
Maybe she got cold feet.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.150
She would have
called me

03:02.150 --> 03:03.600
if she couldn’t make it.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.650
And Lily does not get cold feet.

03:05.650 --> 03:08.310
I mean, not that I would know.

03:08.810 --> 03:09.980
I mean, not literally.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.850
Uh, you know what I mean.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.690
Look, something happened to her.
I’m sure of it.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.190
Yet you called us,
not the police.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.440
So there’s something

03:16.440 --> 03:17.900
you’re not telling us, Harlan.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.850
(sighs) If I’m right,

03:20.850 --> 03:23.890
and if something
has happened to Lily,

03:23.890 --> 03:28.600
there’s a pretty good chance
that I’m gonna be a suspect.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.890
♪ ♪

04:01.210 --> 04:04.920
That’s Lily. Wait, you know,
I think there’s a better one.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.230
WATSON:
You’re pretty familiar
with her social media.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.170
Is she your girlfriend?

04:09.070 --> 04:10.190
If only she were
his girlfriend.

04:10.190 --> 04:12.820
Hey. There’s a reason
I haven’t made a move.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.400
Myriad reasons,
endless reasons.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.149
Someone want to
catch me up?

04:16.149 --> 04:18.649
(sighs) I have been
advising Lily

04:18.649 --> 04:19.700
for a couple of years.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.649
We’ve spent a lot
of time together.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.450
And yes...

04:24.190 --> 04:25.490
I like her.

04:25.490 --> 04:27.450
Like,like her like her.

04:27.450 --> 04:28.990
But you never told her.

04:28.990 --> 04:30.650
(sighs)
I’m her supervisor.

04:30.650 --> 04:32.530
It’s not appropriate.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.900
Besides, the university forbids
faculty-student relationships.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.490
So now you think other people
have become aware

04:39.490 --> 04:42.700
that you’re attracted to her,
and this will make you a suspect

04:42.700 --> 04:44.190
if she comes
to some harm?

04:44.190 --> 04:46.570
I got a warning
from the Dean of Mathematics

04:46.570 --> 04:47.700
a couple weeks ago.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.320
Apparently,
some students and faculty

04:50.320 --> 04:51.820
had taken notice and complained.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.490
So you’re worried that if
something’s happened to her,

04:54.490 --> 04:56.240
that people are gonna think
you’re responsible.

04:56.240 --> 04:59.780
Look, I don’t want to make this
seem like it’s all about me.

04:59.780 --> 05:02.900
The most important thing to me
is that Lily is okay.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.450
I care about her.

05:05.110 --> 05:07.490
But I’m also not an idiot.

05:07.490 --> 05:08.700
I know how this could look.

05:08.700 --> 05:12.190
I get slapped on the wrist
for taking an interest in her,

05:12.190 --> 05:13.820
and then she disappears.

05:13.820 --> 05:15.360
We’ll talk to her roommate
and her family,

05:15.360 --> 05:17.900
but to be honest,
she could be safe and sound.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.780
But if something
has happened,

05:18.780 --> 05:20.070
and from what
you’re describing,

05:20.070 --> 05:22.280
I don’t think anyone is gonna

05:22.280 --> 05:24.030
suspect you
of hurting her.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.400
(knocking at door)

05:31.190 --> 05:32.450
Harlan Emple?

05:32.450 --> 05:34.400
I’m Agent Polk.
This is Agent Spinoza.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
We’re with the FBI.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.400
We need to speak to you
about one of your students,

05:38.400 --> 05:40.070
Lily Zavala.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.360
Is she all right?

05:41.360 --> 05:42.780
Miss Zavala was kidnapped.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.530
We’d like to ask you
some questions.

05:47.530 --> 05:49.150
POLK:
My boss talked to your captain,

05:49.150 --> 05:50.610
said I should
bring you up to speed.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.190
Far as we can tell,
Miss Zavala was last seen

05:53.190 --> 05:54.190
leaving the campus library

05:54.190 --> 05:56.190
around 11:00,
night before last.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.860
Her apartment’s only
a few blocks away,

05:57.860 --> 05:58.860
at 108th and Amsterdam, but it

05:58.860 --> 06:00.700
doesn’t look like
she ever made it home.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.190
This morning, her
parents got a call

06:02.190 --> 06:04.240
from the kidnappers, demanding
half a million dollars

06:04.240 --> 06:06.070
in exchange for her return.

06:06.070 --> 06:07.700
That’s when we were notified.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.610
Does her family
have that kind of money?

06:09.610 --> 06:12.200
Mom owns a successful
software company,

06:12.200 --> 06:13.400
so the parents are ready to pay.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.190
Our counterparts in
San Jose are set up there,

06:16.190 --> 06:17.740
awaiting instructions
from the kidnappers.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.190
Meantime, we’re doing our best
to find Miss Zavala.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.240
So I take it you became
interested in Harlan

06:22.240 --> 06:23.700
after you visited the school?

06:23.700 --> 06:24.860
And I take it you’re aware

06:24.860 --> 06:26.780
of Mr. Emple’s fixation
on the victim?

06:26.780 --> 06:28.570
"Fixation" is
a rather loaded word.

06:28.570 --> 06:29.490
Is it wrong in this case?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.450
Well, it is if you’re suggesting
that he could do her harm.

06:32.450 --> 06:33.530
The captain vouched for us.

06:33.530 --> 06:35.190
I, in turn,
can vouch for Harlan.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.190
He wouldn’t hurt a fly.

06:36.190 --> 06:39.190
Well, the dean we spoke to
cited multiple reports

06:39.190 --> 06:42.070
of Mr. Emple’s
inappropriate behavior.

06:42.190 --> 06:44.490
Showing Miss Zavala
favoritism in class,

06:44.490 --> 06:45.240
giving her gifts.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.190
One student even used the
term "longing looks."

06:48.190 --> 06:49.820
If you don’t
like "fixation,"

06:49.820 --> 06:52.200
how does "obsession" strike you?

06:53.860 --> 06:55.400
I understand you wanting
to help your friend,

06:55.400 --> 06:58.190
but we have a responsibility
to investigate every lead.

06:58.190 --> 07:01.900
If Mr. Emple is innocent, he’s
got nothing to worry about.

07:01.900 --> 07:05.570
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
my partner’s waiting.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.320
Harlan’s fear of getting
himself in trouble

07:12.320 --> 07:15.190
is the very thing that has
made him appear suspicious.

07:15.190 --> 07:17.030
I don’t think it’s fair.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.200
He did not kidnap her.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.650
But if she disappeared
between the library

07:19.650 --> 07:21.320
and her apartment,
I’m sure that the FBI

07:21.320 --> 07:23.070
is definitely
canvassing that area.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.030
I think we should, too.

07:24.030 --> 07:25.610
Maybe we’ll find
something they missed.

07:25.610 --> 07:26.950
You go.
I’d like to stay here.

07:26.950 --> 07:28.030
Obviously, the
Bureau is barking

07:28.030 --> 07:29.700
up the wrong tree
with Harlan, but they are

07:29.700 --> 07:31.820
several hours ahead of us
in their investigation,

07:31.820 --> 07:35.190
so I’d like to find
out what they know.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.110
Sorry. Like I already
told the FBI guys,

07:38.110 --> 07:39.950
our cameras haven’t
worked here in ages.

07:39.950 --> 07:42.150
I think the owner just
likes them there for show.

07:42.150 --> 07:43.240
What about someone
who was working here

07:43.240 --> 07:45.200
around 11:00 two nights ago--
maybe they saw something?

07:45.200 --> 07:49.070
We close by 10:00, so by 11:00,
everyone who works here is gone.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.190
Hey!

07:50.190 --> 07:52.360
I told you to stop
emptying your toilet

07:52.360 --> 07:54.190
in our toilet!

07:54.190 --> 07:56.450
Was there anything else?

07:56.450 --> 07:57.190
No.

07:57.190 --> 08:00.190
You’ve been really helpful.
Thanks.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.070
WATSON:
Excuse me.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.190
Sir, do you live
in your car?

08:06.190 --> 08:07.530
Hey, look, it’s
parked legally.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.990
Alternate side isn’t
until tomorrow.

08:08.990 --> 08:10.360
No, no, no,
I’m not hassling you.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.190
A woman was kidnapped
in this area

08:12.190 --> 08:13.200
two nights ago,
around 11:00.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.740
I was just looking for anyone
who might have seen something.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.570
Uh... oh, well, then no,
I don’t live in the car,

08:18.570 --> 08:19.780
and I wasn’t around then,

08:19.780 --> 08:22.190
but I did have a guest
booked that night.

08:22.190 --> 08:23.900
He might have
seen something.

08:23.900 --> 08:24.700
You had a guest?

08:24.700 --> 08:27.190
I’m sorry, people pay you
to sleep in your car?

08:27.190 --> 08:29.190
Yeah, it’s called AwayKay
Mobile. It’s part of the app.

08:29.190 --> 08:32.190
You know, like you’d rent out
an apartment for the night,

08:32.190 --> 08:34.320
only this is a lot cheaper.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.450
It’s totally legal,
as long as I obey

08:36.450 --> 08:38.780
the parking laws
and keep it clean.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.190
Okay, so you
were parked here

08:40.190 --> 08:41.820
two night ago,
and someone was sleeping here.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.190
Do you mind giving me
their information?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.150
Oh, yeah, sure, totally.
Um, I-I just...

08:45.150 --> 08:48.190
gotta make a quick
phone call first, okay?

08:49.190 --> 08:50.950
Hey, Tori.
Hey, hey, it’s Eli.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.190
Yeah, just wanted
to let you know

08:52.190 --> 08:55.650
your AwayKay Mobile
is ready for check-in.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.990
How’s Harlan holding up?

09:01.990 --> 09:04.190
As well as can be expected.

09:04.190 --> 09:05.570
Hasn’t been arrested yet.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.190
Anything come
of your lead--

09:07.190 --> 09:09.150
the man who spent a
night in a minivan?

09:09.150 --> 09:12.070
He saw a woman matching
Lily’s description

09:12.070 --> 09:13.740
being forced into a car
by a man.

09:13.740 --> 09:14.950
He didn’t come forward sooner

09:14.950 --> 09:17.320
because he thought it was just
a domestic spat.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.650
Also, he was
in the city,

09:19.650 --> 09:21.070
spending as little money
as possible,

09:21.070 --> 09:22.320
because he was cheating
on his wife.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.190
Did our frugal philanderer get
a look at the kidnapper’s face?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.860
No, it was too dark,
but he did describe the car--

09:27.860 --> 09:29.780
a blue Toyota
with a white door panel.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.450
I passed the information
on to Agent Polk.

09:31.450 --> 09:33.950
Now, the kidnapper and Harlan’s
body type do not match,

09:33.950 --> 09:36.450
but Agent Polk
did not seem to care.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.450
Of course he didn’t.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.070
Harlan could have
hired someone

09:39.070 --> 09:41.950
to abduct Lily for him.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.190
You seem annoyed by him.

09:44.190 --> 09:46.190
Agent Polk’s just doing his job.

09:46.190 --> 09:47.320
Not him. By Harlan.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.990
I noticed yesterday
at the apartment.

09:48.990 --> 09:51.110
It’s almost like you blame him

09:51.110 --> 09:52.280
for making himself a suspect.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.490
For two years, I’ve listened
to him whine about Lily.

09:55.490 --> 09:58.110
I suggested that he
break the school rules

09:58.110 --> 09:59.820
if he really cares
about her that much.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.030
Or resign his position,

10:01.030 --> 10:02.320
find a job elsewhere.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.650
Or just forget about her,
move on.

10:03.650 --> 10:05.190
At the very least,
I urged him

10:05.190 --> 10:06.240
to find out where he stands.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.570
But he wouldn’t do that.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.110
No. I think, on some level,

10:09.110 --> 10:12.030
he likes having his affections
set on the unattainable.

10:12.030 --> 10:12.950
It’s safer.

10:12.950 --> 10:15.530
As long as he loves someone
that he can’t have,

10:15.530 --> 10:18.450
then he never has
to put himself at risk.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.490
(cell phone chiming)

10:20.490 --> 10:21.400
It’s Marcus.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.490
A vehicle matching
the description of the kidnapper

10:23.490 --> 10:26.110
was spotted outside
an abandoned school.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.190
(siren wailing)

10:34.360 --> 10:37.200
Feds led the way in
30 minutes ago.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.190
Miss Zavala?

10:38.190 --> 10:40.400
I’m told there’s evidence
she was being held here,

10:40.400 --> 10:41.530
but she isn’t
here anymore.

10:41.530 --> 10:43.110
Any idea where
they took her

10:43.110 --> 10:44.030
or if she’s alive?

10:44.030 --> 10:45.900
I’m about to head in myself.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.190
I heard one more thing.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.900
Feds found a body in there.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.190
POLK:
His name is James Cantrell.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.780
Ex-con, goes by Jimmy.

11:02.780 --> 11:06.190
Spent three years in Otisville
for armed robbery.

11:06.190 --> 11:09.070
WATSON: Well, he fits the
description of the kidnapper

11:09.070 --> 11:10.650
that the AwayKay witness
gave us.

11:10.650 --> 11:12.190
I’m gonna go out on a limb
and say

11:12.190 --> 11:13.650
we’re looking
at the murder weapon.

11:13.650 --> 11:15.400
Probably means
this wasn’t planned.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.990
We think Mr. Cantrell
had an accomplice.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.450
Could be things went south
between them.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.650
What about the Toyota
parked outside?

11:20.650 --> 11:22.150
Any idea who owns it?

11:22.150 --> 11:23.700
I ran the
registration.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.700
It was reported stolen
a week ago.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.570
So far, looks like
a dead end.

11:27.570 --> 11:28.860
You said there
was evidence

11:28.860 --> 11:31.110
that Lily Zavala
was held here.

11:31.110 --> 11:32.820
In here.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.030
It looks like Miss Zavala
was tied up over there.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.570
There’s duct tape
on the legs of the chair.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.450
Those are from Lily’s glasses.

11:49.450 --> 11:52.190
I recognize them
from the photos.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.190
We got scuff marks
from shoe heels

11:55.190 --> 11:56.110
leading out the door.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.030
Figure she put up a fight
on her way out.

11:58.030 --> 12:00.190
Hopefully, whoever has her
will still make contact

12:00.190 --> 12:02.190
with the ransom
instructions.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.190
I’m not so sure they will.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.950
What, you think
she’s already dead?

12:05.950 --> 12:07.570
No, I didn’t say that.

12:07.570 --> 12:09.780
But I’m starting to doubt
whether this

12:09.780 --> 12:10.860
was ever about ransom.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.320
I know from conversations
with Harlan

12:13.320 --> 12:15.150
that this is the particular
energy drink

12:15.150 --> 12:17.360
that Miss Zavala likes
to keep her mind sharp

12:17.360 --> 12:18.700
when she’s working on

12:18.700 --> 12:20.950
particularly difficult
equations.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.190
POLK:
So?

12:22.190 --> 12:23.280
Kidnappers bring their victims

12:23.280 --> 12:25.190
special food requests
all the time.

12:25.190 --> 12:26.400
Helps keep them compliant.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.240
But there’s also this packet

12:28.240 --> 12:30.280
for a scientific calculator.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.450
I don’t think they were just
holding her here.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.570
I think they had her
doing mathematics.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.030
WATSON:
Maybe they took her

12:37.030 --> 12:38.150
because they want her to work

12:38.150 --> 12:39.780
on a problem for them.
Well, if they did,

12:39.780 --> 12:41.860
there’s much less chance
they’ll let her go free

12:41.860 --> 12:43.700
when she’s finished--
ransom or no.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.360
Even if she hasn’t seen
the kidnappers’ faces,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.740
she could tell us what kind
of work they had her doing.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.190
And that could help us
identify them.

12:49.190 --> 12:50.610
Or, at the very least,

12:50.610 --> 12:51.860
thwart whatever plans they have

12:51.860 --> 12:53.280
for the data
she was providing.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.190
Meaning, if she is
still alive right now,

12:55.190 --> 12:57.990
as soon as she’s done with what
they need her to do...

12:57.990 --> 13:00.950
There’s every chance
she’s a dead woman.

13:04.690 --> 13:06.690
Lily was kidnapped
so she could do math?

13:07.190 --> 13:08.650
At the moment,
it’s just a theory.

13:09.650 --> 13:12.450
But how else to explain
the items we found at the scene?

13:12.450 --> 13:14.700
Don’t get me wrong--
it makes sense.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.610
Lily is a genius.

13:15.610 --> 13:19.070
But if the people who took her
only wanted her for math,

13:19.070 --> 13:20.990
then what’s up
with the ransom demand?

13:20.990 --> 13:23.190
Well, I have a theory
about that, as well.

13:23.190 --> 13:24.200
But first-- do you recall her

13:24.200 --> 13:26.990
ever mentioning a man
named Jimmy Cantrell?

13:26.990 --> 13:27.900
No.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.150
He’s the man who was killed.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.190
The FBI found a burner
phone in his pocket.

13:31.190 --> 13:34.030
It’s the same phone used
to contact Lily’s parents.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.190
So, that’s why his partner
killed him?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.650
He was just tying up
a loose end?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.950
No, I think it’s more
complicated than that.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.990
I think Jimmy went off-script.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.360
He and his partner

13:43.360 --> 13:45.190
kidnapped Lily
to apply her to a problem

13:45.190 --> 13:47.190
that involved
complicated mathematics.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.570
Nothing more, nothing less.

13:49.570 --> 13:51.190
I submit that, subsequently,

13:51.190 --> 13:55.070
Jimmy discovered that Lily came
from a wealthy family.

13:55.070 --> 13:56.110
How?

13:56.110 --> 13:58.190
Well, it’s possible
she told him herself

13:58.190 --> 13:59.360
in a bid to buy her freedom,

13:59.360 --> 14:01.650
or perhaps her social
media had indications.

14:01.650 --> 14:02.280
In any event,

14:02.280 --> 14:05.400
they now had a second way
to profit from her abduction.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.240
He made the ransom demand
without telling his partner.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.900
And then his partner found out
about it and killed him.

14:11.900 --> 14:15.450
There was ample evidence that
the murder was not premeditated.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.110
If Jimmy was
a loose end,

14:17.110 --> 14:18.190
why not kill him elsewhere,

14:18.190 --> 14:19.610
and with a weapon
more traditional

14:19.610 --> 14:21.030
than a rusty fire extinguisher?

14:21.030 --> 14:25.240
Also, since his demise,
Lily’s parents have received

14:25.240 --> 14:26.610
no additional
instructions.

14:26.610 --> 14:30.190
Okay, but why wouldn’t the
partner want the ransom money?

14:30.190 --> 14:31.900
Well, I imagine he stands
to profit more

14:31.900 --> 14:33.200
from the work
that Lily is doing.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.190
We won’t know
until we catch him.

14:40.190 --> 14:43.070
Do you think that she saw it?

14:43.190 --> 14:46.070
This jackass
getting his head bashed in?

14:46.070 --> 14:47.570
Oh, well,
that’s difficult to say.

14:47.570 --> 14:51.860
She was being held
in an adjoining room.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.030
You’re upset.

14:54.030 --> 14:54.990
Look, look, if you...

14:54.990 --> 14:56.950
if you need to disrobe,
feel free.

14:56.950 --> 14:58.280
You’re in a safe place.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.820
Just-just mind the furniture.

14:59.820 --> 15:01.990
No, I only get naked for math.

15:01.990 --> 15:05.190
This, this...
this is the opposite of math.

15:05.190 --> 15:08.360
This doesn’t make
any sense.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.280
Kidnapping someone like Lily,

15:11.280 --> 15:14.110
putting her through all that...

15:15.650 --> 15:17.110
Oh, my God.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.320
What if the FBI thinks
that I’m the partner?

15:19.320 --> 15:20.950
Well, the thought
did cross their mind,

15:20.950 --> 15:23.570
but I was quick to point out
that your mathematics skills

15:23.570 --> 15:25.030
far exceed Lily’s.

15:25.030 --> 15:26.740
There isn’t a problem
that exists

15:26.740 --> 15:28.780
that you couldn’t tackle
on your own.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.190
In the meantime,

15:30.190 --> 15:32.190
Joan and one of our colleagues
are meeting

15:32.190 --> 15:33.900
with Jimmy Cantrell’s
parole officer.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.190
With any luck, we’ll find
the name of the partner

15:37.190 --> 15:39.700
on a list of known associates.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.450
MAN:
Guess I was wrong about Jimmy.

15:43.450 --> 15:44.900
He did have brains.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.490
I can see ’em
all over his shirt.

15:46.490 --> 15:48.400
WATSON:
How long were you
his parole officer?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.610
Little over six months.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.110
I told him, just like
I tell all my guys,

15:52.110 --> 15:54.200
keep your nose clean,
you’ll be fine.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.860
Obviously, Jimmy
didn’t listen.

15:55.860 --> 15:59.030
And now his nose
is at the back of his skull.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.530
This is everything
I got on him.

16:01.530 --> 16:03.190
It’s not a lot, huh?

16:03.190 --> 16:05.110
Like I said,
only had him for six months.

16:05.110 --> 16:06.190
Do you know if
he was hanging out

16:06.190 --> 16:07.740
with some people
that he shouldn’t have?

16:07.740 --> 16:11.190
Far as I could tell, he was on
the straight and narrow.

16:11.190 --> 16:12.360
No drinking, no drugs.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.070
Only problem he had
was finding work,

16:14.070 --> 16:16.610
but that’s par for the course
with these guys.

16:16.610 --> 16:17.780
What about Jimmy’s two brothers?

16:17.780 --> 16:19.190
Says here they were
his codefendants

16:19.190 --> 16:21.650
in the liquor store robbery
he went to prison for.

16:21.650 --> 16:22.610
Mmm, Conrad and Geno.

16:22.610 --> 16:23.950
They’re both still locked up.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.650
Jimmy was just their wheelman,
so he got a shorter sentence.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.030
Obviously, neither one of them
did this kidnapping with him.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.190
Can you think of any reason
why he would have needed help

16:32.190 --> 16:34.190
from an applied mathematician?

16:34.190 --> 16:35.150
(chuckles) Sure.

16:35.150 --> 16:37.530
Someone asked him
what two plus two was.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.070
(chuckling)

16:40.990 --> 16:42.740
Jimmy was a simple guy.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.030
Abducting this girl
and putting her to work

16:45.030 --> 16:46.190
on some mystery math problem?

16:46.190 --> 16:48.320
It doesn’t sound simple;
it sounds complicated.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.240
I gotta think
it was the partner’s idea.

16:52.530 --> 16:55.570
You see the business card
I stapled to the folder?

16:55.570 --> 16:58.070
BELL:
"Marvin Hathaway."

16:58.070 --> 16:59.320
Jimmy’s landlord.
You should call him.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.860
Ask him to let you
into Jimmy’s apartment.

17:01.860 --> 17:03.820
That was the last place
I saw Jimmy.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.200
Popped in on him three days ago.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.900
Nothing seemed out
of the ordinary, but who knows?

17:07.900 --> 17:10.150
Maybe you’ll see
something I missed.

17:10.150 --> 17:13.030
I didn’t have
any complaints against Jimmy.

17:13.030 --> 17:16.150
I’d even go so far as to say
he was a good tenant,

17:16.150 --> 17:19.650
if he didn’t owe me
three months back rent.

17:20.190 --> 17:22.700
I guess I can kiss
that good-bye.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.950
Oh. I see why Jimmy was
behind on his rent.

17:31.950 --> 17:32.820
He was a betting man.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.190
These numbers are the lines
he was getting from his bookie.

17:35.190 --> 17:39.240
I’m guessing these X’s are games
that didn’t go his way.

17:39.780 --> 17:40.570
HOLMES:
If they are,

17:40.570 --> 17:42.280
then he was as
habitual a loser

17:42.280 --> 17:43.650
as he was a gambler.

17:43.650 --> 17:45.110
MARVIN:
That son of a bitch.

17:45.110 --> 17:47.650
He told me he was sending the
money home to his mother.

17:47.650 --> 17:51.150
If you find any here, does it
go to pay the people he owed?

17:51.150 --> 17:53.570
I think maybe you should
wait outside, Mr. Hathaway.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.490
We’ll find you
when we’re done.

17:58.070 --> 18:00.490
What do you make
of these?

18:02.190 --> 18:03.360
Ink stains?

18:03.360 --> 18:05.530
Look how they’re
all clustered.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.650
The spacing is even,
but the pattern

18:07.650 --> 18:10.070
is always different.

18:10.070 --> 18:11.200
Bingo.

18:12.190 --> 18:13.200
Literally.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.280
These are made by
a bingo dauber,

18:16.280 --> 18:17.740
a pen used to mark bingo cards.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.530
And they were created
when an especially damp dauber

18:20.530 --> 18:21.740
bled through a set of cards.

18:21.740 --> 18:23.820
So Jimmy wasn’t
just placing sports bets.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.990
He was spending time
in a bingo parlor?

18:25.990 --> 18:28.190
WATSON:
There’s a lot of math
in bookmaking, right?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.450
So maybe Jimmy’s bookie
was his partner.

18:30.450 --> 18:33.200
He needed a mathematician
for something complicated,

18:33.200 --> 18:35.860
so Jimmy kidnapped Lily for him.

18:35.860 --> 18:36.530
Could be.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.190
But there are
hundreds of bookies

18:38.190 --> 18:39.190
in the New York area.

18:39.190 --> 18:41.570
We’ve got no indication
which one he was using.

18:41.570 --> 18:46.190
Actually, I think
you’re wrong about that.

18:48.610 --> 18:51.150
N-36.

18:51.150 --> 18:53.530
N-three-six.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.360
I-30.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.190
I-three-zero.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.190
BELL:
Sylvia Kozar.

19:00.190 --> 19:03.030
Detective Bell.
You remember me?

19:03.030 --> 19:04.030
I used to work Vice.

19:04.030 --> 19:06.070
Arrested your son
a few years back.

19:06.070 --> 19:07.150
He was collecting for you.

19:07.150 --> 19:09.820
Broke the arm of a guy
who owed you money.

19:09.820 --> 19:10.650
I remember you.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.740
Sylvia may not look it,
but she’s one of

19:12.740 --> 19:14.650
the baddest bookmakers
in the city.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.190
She’s been at it a long time.

19:16.190 --> 19:19.150
I’m just the humble owner
of a bingo parlor.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.860
You want to play,
Detective?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.320
First card’s on me.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.700
HOLMES: No.
We want to know

19:23.700 --> 19:25.610
about Jimmy Cantrell.
We think that, in addition

19:25.610 --> 19:28.280
to playing bingo here,
he also placed bets with you.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.320
I never heard of him.
WATSON: A few nights ago,

19:31.320 --> 19:34.030
Jimmy kidnapped a woman
named Lily Zavala.

19:34.030 --> 19:34.990
She was a mathematician.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.490
BELL:
When my colleague
wondered if it

19:36.490 --> 19:38.700
might have something
to do with bookmaking,

19:38.700 --> 19:39.650
I thought of you.

19:39.650 --> 19:41.190
Maybe you
made him a deal.

19:41.190 --> 19:41.990
He kidnaps someone

19:41.990 --> 19:44.900
who can help you
set better lines on games,

19:44.900 --> 19:46.190
you forgive his debt.

19:46.190 --> 19:49.820
I told you when you arrested
my son: I’m no bookie.

19:49.820 --> 19:51.650
No, you’re a bingo queen.

19:51.650 --> 19:52.860
The thing is,
a mathematician

19:52.860 --> 19:53.990
could be equally helpful to you

19:53.990 --> 19:56.780
in that capacity,
’cause you cheat.

19:56.950 --> 19:58.190
I’ve been looking
at your blower,

19:58.190 --> 20:00.820
and I have yet to see
a number six or 29.

20:00.820 --> 20:04.070
Perhaps that’s not the extent
of your chicanery.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.070
The arrangement
of the numbers

20:05.070 --> 20:06.190
on the bingo cards
can be manipulated

20:06.190 --> 20:07.490
to favor the house.
It’s not easy,

20:07.490 --> 20:09.110
’cause places like this
are highly regulated,

20:09.110 --> 20:11.280
and inspectors are trained
to look for such things.

20:11.280 --> 20:11.990
But who knows?

20:11.990 --> 20:14.650
With the help of
a genius mathematician...

20:14.650 --> 20:15.530
Sylvia...

20:15.530 --> 20:18.490
if I stop the game right now
and check the machine,

20:18.490 --> 20:20.280
am I gonna find
two balls missing?

20:20.280 --> 20:21.490
’Cause I don’t see that

20:21.490 --> 20:23.820
going over too well
with your patrons.

20:23.820 --> 20:27.150
Yeah, could be enough to
shut this whole place down.

20:27.150 --> 20:28.900
All right, fine.

20:28.900 --> 20:29.950
I know Jimmy.

20:29.950 --> 20:32.610
But I don’t know anything
about any kidnapping.

20:32.610 --> 20:36.190
And if he said different,
he’s lying to you.

20:36.190 --> 20:37.190
Jimmy’s dead.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.450
Someone bashed
his skull in last night.

20:39.450 --> 20:40.860
We think the person
who put him up

20:40.860 --> 20:42.320
to the kidnapping
is the one who did it.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.740
Yeah, well, I don’t need
any mathematician.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.570
Why would I?

20:46.570 --> 20:49.990
I set my own lines.
I always have.

20:50.190 --> 20:52.030
And those cards are legit.

20:52.030 --> 20:53.240
BELL:
I don’t know, Sylvia.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.070
Based on the notes
Jimmy was keeping,

20:55.070 --> 20:58.070
he was into you
for at least five grand.

20:58.070 --> 20:59.190
Try ten.

20:59.950 --> 21:00.860
But we were square.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.280
He paid me off in full
the other day.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.150
You see those cameras?

21:05.150 --> 21:07.150
They run 24-7.

21:07.740 --> 21:09.190
I’ll show you.
He walked in here,

21:09.190 --> 21:12.190
and he handed me an envelope.
WATSON: Say we believe you.

21:12.190 --> 21:15.610
Did Jimmy mention how
he got the ten grand?

21:15.610 --> 21:18.190
He said he was hired
to do some work.

21:18.190 --> 21:20.190
He was paid in advance.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.110
Maybe the work

21:21.110 --> 21:22.900
was to get the girl.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.030
But whoever hired him...

21:25.030 --> 21:26.190
wasn’t me.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.530
HOLMES: Look, I-I don’t know
what to tell you.

21:28.530 --> 21:31.740
We had a lead,
and then we didn’t.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.190
Yes, of course
I’ll keep you apprised.

21:34.190 --> 21:36.280
Yes. Okay.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.030
Good-bye.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.190
WATSON:
Harlan again?

21:39.190 --> 21:41.570
(sighs)
Six calls in less than an hour.

21:41.570 --> 21:42.700
He’s worried about Lily.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.190
I’m worried about Lily.
Been 72 hours,

21:44.190 --> 21:46.190
and we’re officially
out of suspects.

21:46.190 --> 21:47.820
Have you heard
anything else from the FBI?

21:47.820 --> 21:50.700
Only that Harlan is still
a person of interest.

21:50.700 --> 21:51.860
I thought they
agreed with you

21:51.860 --> 21:53.280
that Lily was being
forced to do math.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.700
Harlan doesn’t
need help doing math.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.950
No, but perhaps he takes
perverse pleasure

21:56.950 --> 22:00.070
in watching her slave over a
particularly difficult problem.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.190
Perhaps he gave her those items

22:01.190 --> 22:03.240
because he’s the mathematical
equivalent of a sadist.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.190
Is that what they think?
I don’t know what they think.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.360
You know, I was thinking
about what you said last night.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.400
About how Harlan chose
to fall in love with Lily

22:14.400 --> 22:16.530
because she was unattainable.

22:16.530 --> 22:17.650
Because it was safer.

22:17.650 --> 22:20.190
How is that different from what
you do with Moriarty?

22:20.190 --> 22:22.190
Excuse me?
You can’t be with her,

22:22.190 --> 22:23.360
but you haven’t let her go.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.280
Is that because it’s safer?

22:24.280 --> 22:27.110
Are you comparing
my relationship with Moriarty

22:27.110 --> 22:28.700
to Harlan’s relationship
with Lily?

22:28.700 --> 22:30.360
Yeah. Because of what
you said last night.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.400
And because I think
you’re lonely.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
I have for a while now.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.190
Lonely?

22:35.190 --> 22:36.240
You’re forgetting
I called you

22:36.240 --> 22:37.780
yesterday from Athena’s bedroom.

22:37.780 --> 22:38.780
I’m not talking about sex.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.320
I’m talking about
a relationship-- a real one.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.820
You think you’re annoyed
with Harlan? Try being me.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.190
You’re annoyed with me?

22:44.190 --> 22:44.990
Yeah, I am.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.860
I have been since you
broke up with Fiona.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.030
She was great.
You really liked her.

22:49.030 --> 22:50.110
Watson.
And you know

22:50.110 --> 22:51.190
why you broke up with her?

22:51.190 --> 22:52.400
Because she’s not Moriarty.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.490
Harlan is not
the only one

22:53.490 --> 22:55.950
who needs to get out
of his own way.

22:55.950 --> 22:57.820
Neither of you has to be alone.

22:57.820 --> 22:58.950
(cell phone ringing)

22:58.950 --> 23:00.780
You’ll be surprised
to learn there have been

23:00.780 --> 23:02.530
zero leads
since your last call.

23:02.530 --> 23:04.780
HARLAN:
Actually, I have a lead.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.070
Big one.

23:06.070 --> 23:07.190
It’s Lily.

23:07.190 --> 23:09.190
She isn’t missing anymore.

23:09.190 --> 23:11.740
She’s here with me.

23:11.740 --> 23:14.200
She escaped.

23:16.190 --> 23:17.940
GREGSON: Are you sure
you’re up for this?

23:17.940 --> 23:20.560
Between the E.R. docs
and the Feds last night,

23:20.560 --> 23:22.440
I’m not sure
you got much sleep.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.900
WATSON: We know you’ve
been through a lot.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.060
We can talk later
if you want.

23:27.060 --> 23:27.980
Thanks.

23:27.980 --> 23:31.100
But I’d rather
be helpful right now.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.020
Besides, Harlan says that

23:33.020 --> 23:35.400
if anyone’s gonna get
whoever did this,

23:35.400 --> 23:36.850
it’s you guys.

23:36.850 --> 23:37.690
GREGSON:
All right.

23:37.690 --> 23:39.020
What can you
tell us about them?

23:39.020 --> 23:41.770
Well, I’m pretty sure
there were only two of them.

23:41.770 --> 23:44.440
They wore masks,
so I never saw their faces.

23:45.940 --> 23:49.390
But I could tell one
was older than the other.

23:49.390 --> 23:52.350
Does he look familiar?

23:52.690 --> 23:55.230
Only because the FBI
showed me the same photo.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.200
They say they think
he’s the one who grabbed me.

23:57.590 --> 23:59.790
That he’s dead now.

23:59.790 --> 24:00.710
Jimmy Cantrell.

24:00.710 --> 24:03.630
Does that name sound familiar?

24:05.710 --> 24:07.590
He put a hood over my head,

24:07.590 --> 24:11.460
and he kept it on until we got
to this abandoned school.

24:11.460 --> 24:15.170
The older guy
was already there.

24:15.170 --> 24:16.090
He gave me supplies.

24:16.090 --> 24:17.790
He told me
what he wanted me to do

24:17.790 --> 24:20.790
and that he was gonna let me go
when it was done.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.960
Do you think the older
man was the boss?

24:22.960 --> 24:24.750
It felt that way.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.630
I... I think the other guy

24:26.630 --> 24:28.800
was there mostly
just to keep an eye on me.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.250
At one point,
the older guy came back,

24:32.250 --> 24:35.920
and he was very mad
at the other one.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.300
So they went to the hall.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.920
I-I couldn’t hear
what they were fighting about.

24:40.920 --> 24:45.710
But then there were
these loud noises.

24:45.710 --> 24:46.790
And then it went silent.

24:46.790 --> 24:49.170
And then just
the older guy came back.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.550
He put the hood
back on me,

24:50.550 --> 24:52.880
and then he forced me
into the trunk of a car.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.380
What about where
he took you next?

24:55.380 --> 24:56.790
Anything you
can tell us?

24:56.790 --> 24:57.790
It was a basement.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.590
We went down a flight of stairs.

24:59.590 --> 25:01.670
He made me get
back to work.

25:01.670 --> 25:03.300
When I was finished,
he put the hood

25:03.300 --> 25:07.250
back on and put me back
in the trunk of his car.

25:07.250 --> 25:10.210
Only this time, I...

25:10.210 --> 25:14.090
I felt a shovel next to me.

25:14.090 --> 25:17.800
And I realized
that he was gonna kill me.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.790
So, how did you escape?

25:19.790 --> 25:21.790
I used the edge of the shovel

25:21.790 --> 25:23.790
to cut the tape
around my wrists.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.000
And I got
the hood off,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.210
and the trunk
had one of these

25:27.210 --> 25:29.210
glow-in-the-dark handles inside.

25:29.210 --> 25:31.790
So, eventually,
I just felt the car stop

25:31.790 --> 25:33.790
at a light or something, and...

25:33.790 --> 25:36.340
I just made a break for it.

25:36.340 --> 25:37.340
I just ran.

25:37.340 --> 25:38.840
So, why did you go to Harlan’s?

25:38.840 --> 25:41.590
Why not go to the police
or go home?

25:41.590 --> 25:43.170
I was too afraid
to go back home.

25:43.170 --> 25:45.090
And I thought I needed
to warn Harlan.

25:45.090 --> 25:46.790
I thought he might be next.

25:46.790 --> 25:47.790
Why would Harlan be next?

25:47.790 --> 25:51.750
Because that math they had me
working on-- it was his.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.710
They wanted me
to make changes to it.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.710
Is there a way
that I could

25:56.710 --> 25:58.790
print out some maps?

25:58.790 --> 26:01.790
HARLAN:
This is a FEMA flood map.

26:01.790 --> 26:04.750
Kidnappers were making you
redraw flood zones?

26:04.750 --> 26:07.000
Care to let the rest of us in?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.340
Uh, sure.

26:08.340 --> 26:10.250
FEMA, the federal
government,

26:10.250 --> 26:12.790
is in charge of determining
the risk of flooding

26:12.790 --> 26:14.590
for everywhere
in the country.

26:14.590 --> 26:17.790
And maps like this break the
flood risks down into zones.

26:17.790 --> 26:21.750
Red is the highest risk,
orange is second, and so on.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.340
They’re used to plan
emergency responses

26:23.340 --> 26:25.790
and to say who needs flood
insurance, and how much.

26:25.790 --> 26:27.790
But with climate change
and rising sea levels,

26:27.790 --> 26:29.710
FEMA has been redoing
all the old maps.

26:29.710 --> 26:32.250
And you were involved
in that work?

26:32.250 --> 26:34.420
Uh, I was--
three years ago.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.590
There is a staggering
amount of data

26:36.590 --> 26:37.790
that goes into
these maps.

26:37.790 --> 26:41.380
And a lot of it comes down
to statistical analysis,

26:41.380 --> 26:43.460
the likelihood of
X event happening

26:43.460 --> 26:45.050
in Y number of years.

26:45.050 --> 26:46.550
It takes forever.

26:46.550 --> 26:47.960
I mean, I heard from
a colleague recently

26:47.960 --> 26:49.920
that the maps we were
working on back then

26:49.920 --> 26:52.670
are just entering the
public review phase now.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.840
So your maps
aren’t official yet?

26:54.840 --> 26:55.630
No.

26:55.630 --> 26:56.920
And your captors
wanted you

26:56.920 --> 26:58.960
to change the math
that Harlan was doing

26:58.960 --> 27:00.790
in order to make
the maps look different.
Mm-hmm.

27:00.790 --> 27:03.790
Could you show us
what that would look like?
These maps show

27:03.790 --> 27:05.670
what Brooklyn flood zones
look like now,

27:05.670 --> 27:08.710
which is how they’ve looked,
like, since the ’80s.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.920
So, if the work Harlan did
becomes official,

27:10.920 --> 27:17.550
then this red zone would come
all the way out here.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.210
And how did your kidnapper
want the flood zone to look

27:21.210 --> 27:23.630
using the math he made you do?

27:37.790 --> 27:40.840
He wanted you to move
the projected flood waters

27:40.840 --> 27:44.300
to a different neighborhood--
on paper, at least.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.050
Mm-hmm.

27:45.050 --> 27:47.790
So, if Mr. Emple
did the math the first time,

27:47.790 --> 27:49.750
why didn’t they just take you?

27:49.750 --> 27:52.790
Best guess-- I was one
of a group of experts

27:52.790 --> 27:54.130
working on the project.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.380
My name wasn’t on it.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.050
Why take Lily?
From what you’ve told us,

27:57.050 --> 27:58.250
she wasn’t involved at all.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.170
Well, I’ve been wondering
about that, too.

28:00.170 --> 28:03.460
I went to the Floodplain
Coordinator’s Office

28:03.460 --> 28:05.840
a few weeks ago.
I wanted to see the math

28:05.840 --> 28:06.790
behind the maps.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.880
Harlan had talked
about it in class,

28:08.880 --> 28:12.590
about the work he did,
and I wanted to study it.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.920
They copied my I.D.
when I was there.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.960
What I don’t get is,
why would someone want to mess

28:16.960 --> 28:18.710
with flood maps
in the first place?

28:18.710 --> 28:21.380
The area the new map
puts at a higher risk

28:21.380 --> 28:23.460
is some of the hottest
real estate in the city.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.920
Which also makes it subject to
the highest insurance premiums.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.000
Now, you said
that this map is used

28:29.000 --> 28:31.420
to set insurance
requirements, right?

28:31.420 --> 28:32.090
Mm-hmm.

28:32.090 --> 28:34.420
So, if this map became official,

28:34.420 --> 28:36.380
it would make it
really good for anyone

28:36.380 --> 28:40.790
selling flood insurance
to this neighborhood.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.210
MAN:
Wow.

28:43.210 --> 28:45.790
You’re right.
If FEMA adopted this map,

28:45.790 --> 28:47.340
it would be really good for me.

28:47.340 --> 28:50.750
Assuming I don’t care
if the homes and businesses

28:50.750 --> 28:53.960
of half my clients
are underwater in ten years.

28:53.960 --> 28:57.130
And my clients will tell you--
I do care.

28:57.130 --> 28:57.790
Maybe.

28:57.790 --> 29:00.790
But if you were behind
Lily Zavala’s kidnapping,

29:00.790 --> 29:02.460
you made her
generate that map,

29:02.460 --> 29:03.960
so you’d know
the projections are false.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.300
We looked into who makes money
selling insurance

29:06.300 --> 29:09.790
to that specific neighborhood
affected by that map.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.090
Your name keeps
coming up.

29:11.090 --> 29:13.790
It even says it over
there: "Adam Braun,

29:13.790 --> 29:16.670
leading independent agent
four years in a row."

29:16.670 --> 29:19.340
Yeah, no one comes close
to the volume you do.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.420
And if that area
becomes a high-risk zone,

29:21.420 --> 29:24.130
flood insurance would become
mandatory for everyone in it.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.340
You’d be looking at commissions
on hundreds of new policies.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.460
That’s over six figures a year.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.800
Easy money.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.300
You think worse of me
than I thought.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.790
If you’re suggesting I committed
a kidnapping and a murder

29:36.790 --> 29:38.710
just so I could change
a flood map,

29:38.710 --> 29:41.920
you have to believe
I’m some kind of psychopath.

29:41.920 --> 29:42.710
Prove us wrong.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.790
We’re pretty sure
Lily’s kidnapper

29:44.790 --> 29:47.840
killed his accomplice sometime
early yesterday afternoon.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.790
Can you tell us where you were?

29:49.790 --> 29:50.880
I was here, working.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.790
Can anyone corroborate that?

29:52.790 --> 29:54.790
No.

29:54.790 --> 29:58.170
But let me show you something.

30:03.130 --> 30:05.630
It’s a site for selling boats.

30:05.630 --> 30:07.550
Yeah, but this sailboat,
this beautiful lady,

30:07.550 --> 30:09.670
is theMaria Madera,my baby.

30:09.670 --> 30:11.630
My wife is strongly
encouraging me

30:11.630 --> 30:13.130
to sell her.

30:13.130 --> 30:14.710
Upkeep is too high.

30:14.710 --> 30:15.790
All the maintenance,

30:15.790 --> 30:18.000
slip fees,
registration--

30:18.000 --> 30:19.500
it’s thousands of bucks a year.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.790
So, even though
I love this boat,

30:21.790 --> 30:23.790
I’m doing what my wife says.

30:23.790 --> 30:25.590
You have a point here,
Mr. Braun?

30:25.590 --> 30:28.790
Take a look at when
I posted the listing.

30:28.790 --> 30:30.380
It’s two nights ago.

30:30.380 --> 30:35.420
That’s during the time you said
this girl was being held, right?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.750
If I was in the middle
of doing this,

30:39.750 --> 30:42.250
you think I’d be
saying good-bye to my baby?

30:42.250 --> 30:43.800
Don’t you think
I’d tell my wife,

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
"Don’t worry,
things are looking up.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.790
We can afford it"?

30:46.790 --> 30:49.880
Because I promise you,
if my ship was coming in,

30:49.880 --> 30:53.090
my sailboat
would not be going out.

30:54.090 --> 30:56.590
(knocking at door)

30:57.210 --> 30:59.170
Harlan, what is it?

30:59.170 --> 31:00.960
Thank you.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.790
For what?

31:02.790 --> 31:04.550
What do you think?

31:04.550 --> 31:06.130
Harlan, you hired us
to find Lily.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.130
We didn’t. She escaped.
No, I know.

31:08.130 --> 31:11.920
I just... it’s...
I-I finally did it.

31:11.920 --> 31:12.790
Did what?

31:12.790 --> 31:15.000
Told her-- how I really
feel about her.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.210
I-I was nervous, but I was...

31:16.210 --> 31:17.790
I was thinking about you
the whole time,

31:17.790 --> 31:20.210
about how you would tell me
to just do something.

31:20.210 --> 31:21.790
Why were you nervous?

31:21.790 --> 31:22.380
Why do you think?

31:22.380 --> 31:23.790
It was obvious that
your feelings for her

31:23.790 --> 31:26.630
were going to be reciprocated
when she went to study

31:26.630 --> 31:27.380
the work you did for FEMA.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.790
She didn’t go there because
she liked mathematics.

31:28.790 --> 31:31.590
She went there because
she liked you.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.790
(sighing):
Oh, duh.

31:34.790 --> 31:35.800
Yeah, obviously.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.630
Hmm. Went right
over your head, didn’t it?

31:38.630 --> 31:40.420
Yeah, way over.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.790
Cut me a little bit of slack.

31:41.790 --> 31:45.130
You know, me and social cues
are like... (snickers)

31:45.130 --> 31:47.840
relativity
and quantum mechanics.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.460
(makes popping sound, chuckles)

31:49.460 --> 31:50.790
(clears throat)
Point is,

31:50.790 --> 31:52.250
you were right
the whole time.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.790
I just needed to act.

31:53.790 --> 31:56.000
Last couple of days...

31:56.000 --> 31:57.790
almost losing her...

31:57.790 --> 32:00.130
put everything
into perspective.

32:00.130 --> 32:01.380
What about your job?

32:01.380 --> 32:02.960
Oh, we talked about that,
and, um, you know,

32:02.960 --> 32:04.790
we’re just gonna hold off
a little longer,

32:04.790 --> 32:06.210
just till Lily
gets her doctorate.

32:06.210 --> 32:10.130
Um, after that, the university
can’t fire me for dating her,

32:10.130 --> 32:12.050
’cause we will be peers.

32:12.050 --> 32:14.420
Sort of. I mean, I’ll still
be way better at math,

32:14.420 --> 32:17.840
but, um, you know,
she won’t be my student anymore.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.250
Very happy for you, Harlan.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.250
Are you?

32:21.250 --> 32:23.340
’Cause you don’t look happy.

32:23.340 --> 32:25.790
Respectfully, you just caught me
in the middle of some work.

32:25.790 --> 32:26.840
Lily may be safe, but the man

32:26.840 --> 32:28.590
who was holding her
is still unaccounted for.

32:28.590 --> 32:30.090
And, as you said,
you and social cues...

32:30.090 --> 32:32.380
Ah. Totally get it.
I just, um...

32:32.380 --> 32:35.550
If you’re thinking of
hugging me again, don’t do that.

32:36.210 --> 32:37.500
Right.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.880
Sorry. I will go.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.380
But, um...

32:41.380 --> 32:43.250
thank you again.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.500
Never been this happy.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.460
It’s because of you.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.050
Okay.

32:52.050 --> 32:54.420
(door opens)

32:55.300 --> 32:57.420
(door closes)

32:58.670 --> 33:00.130
HOLMES:
I got your text.

33:00.130 --> 33:01.420
Neither you nor Marcus is liking

33:01.420 --> 33:03.500
the insurance agent
for Lily’s co-kidnapper?

33:03.500 --> 33:06.500
No. Everything he told us
panned out.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.380
As far as I can tell,
no one else stood to profit

33:09.380 --> 33:11.790
from an increased danger of
flooding in that neighborhood.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.050
So I’ve been looking
at Lily’s map with fresh eyes,

33:14.050 --> 33:17.920
shifting my focus from areas
where the flood risk increased

33:17.920 --> 33:19.210
to areas where it decreased.

33:19.210 --> 33:21.590
Could be the point of the map
wasn’t to make

33:21.590 --> 33:23.790
this part of Brooklyn
higher risk,

33:23.790 --> 33:26.460
but to keep this part
lower risk.

33:26.460 --> 33:28.920
Okay, but most of the land
in that area is industrial,

33:28.920 --> 33:30.750
so the insurance rates
would already

33:30.750 --> 33:31.800
be pretty low, wouldn’t they?

33:31.800 --> 33:34.880
Yeah, but flood maps don’t just
dictate insurance rates.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.170
They dictate zoning and
development standards, as well.

33:38.170 --> 33:40.790
So, if you own land in that area
and you want to develop...

33:40.790 --> 33:43.000
Higher insurance rates
and flood risk

33:43.000 --> 33:45.050
could make new construction
untenable.

33:45.050 --> 33:46.960
We need to find out
who owns property

33:46.960 --> 33:48.130
in that part of the city.

33:48.130 --> 33:50.630
I’m awaiting a list from
the City Register’s Office.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.790
Any luck, we’ll have it soon.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.420
(clears throat)

33:55.420 --> 33:57.130
So, um...

33:57.130 --> 34:00.500
what makes you think I’m lonely?

34:00.880 --> 34:04.250
Last night, you said
you thought I was lonely.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.340
Wh-Why did you say that?

34:08.790 --> 34:11.050
There was a time
when you were with Fiona

34:11.050 --> 34:12.790
when you were different.

34:12.790 --> 34:14.790
Happier somehow.

34:14.790 --> 34:16.340
I don’t know.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.210
It’s hard to explain.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.090
Harlan came around.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.880
He, um, wanted to tell me

34:21.880 --> 34:25.210
he finally let Lily know
how he felt about her.

34:25.210 --> 34:26.670
And?

34:26.670 --> 34:28.790
The feeling was mutual.

34:28.790 --> 34:32.420
He was practically aglow.

34:34.050 --> 34:37.000
I felt a little envious.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.670
Just a smidge.

34:38.670 --> 34:40.750
So it, uh, just...

34:40.750 --> 34:42.550
made me think
about what you said.

34:42.550 --> 34:44.790
It’s not bad
that you felt that way.

34:44.790 --> 34:45.790
It’s natural.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.790
But there’s no need
to be envious.

34:47.790 --> 34:49.460
You can have everything he has.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.590
Well, that’s just it, you see.

34:51.590 --> 34:55.170
I’m-I’m... not sure I can.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.790
You were right.

34:58.790 --> 35:02.710
I mean, every potential
romantic partner I have

35:02.710 --> 35:06.090
pales in comparison to Moriarty.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.380
That might sound strange,

35:08.380 --> 35:11.170
given what we know
about her, but...

35:11.170 --> 35:14.130
I’m a strange bloke, aren’t I?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.880
She fit.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.130
And I fear that...

35:22.130 --> 35:25.170
what we had can’t be replicated.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.210
Probably can’t.

35:27.210 --> 35:29.130
But that’s okay.

35:29.590 --> 35:31.340
I mean, falling in love
with someone

35:31.340 --> 35:35.790
is not supposed to be
the same experience every time.

35:35.790 --> 35:38.250
Someone else
will be someone else.

35:38.250 --> 35:42.710
Suppose you’re going to suggest
I try online dating next.

35:42.710 --> 35:44.590
Would that be so bad?

35:45.170 --> 35:47.630
Try something else.

35:47.630 --> 35:48.130
Such as?

35:48.130 --> 35:51.340
You’re the one who loves
experiments, so experiment.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.420
(computer chimes)

36:04.550 --> 36:05.960
WATSON:
City Register’s Office.

36:05.960 --> 36:09.460
HOLMES: Yep. The list of every
owner of property in the area

36:09.460 --> 36:11.050
that would have been
positively affected

36:11.050 --> 36:12.960
by Lily’s version
of the map.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.710
I recognize one
of the names.

36:15.710 --> 36:16.790
I don’t.

36:16.790 --> 36:18.420
You’re right,
you don’t,

36:18.420 --> 36:19.340
but if I’m right

36:19.340 --> 36:22.790
we’ve already met
Lily’s kidnapper.

36:27.130 --> 36:28.550
BELL:Sorry to keep you waiting,

36:28.550 --> 36:29.500
Mr. Hathaway.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.090
Detective Bell.

36:30.090 --> 36:32.630
We met when you let us
into Jimmy Cantrell’s apartment.

36:32.630 --> 36:33.790
Right. I got a call.

36:33.790 --> 36:36.800
They, uh, said you did find
some of Jimmy’s assets.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.250
Something that can cover
his back rent?

36:39.250 --> 36:40.090
Come with me.

36:40.090 --> 36:43.630
We’ll go over
everything in here.

36:45.710 --> 36:48.130
Have a seat, Mr. Hathaway.

36:48.130 --> 36:49.250
What is this?

36:49.250 --> 36:52.090
Well, that phone call
you received was a lie.

36:52.090 --> 36:54.170
We’ve been executing
a search warrant

36:54.170 --> 36:55.790
on some properties you own.

36:55.790 --> 36:56.880
We didn’t want you
to know,

36:56.880 --> 37:00.590
so we invited you down here,
made you wait.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.000
Why were you searching
my properties?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.500
GREGSON:
To see which one

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
you moved Lily Zavala to

37:05.500 --> 37:07.420
after you killed
Jimmy Cantrell.

37:07.420 --> 37:09.170
Lily’s kidnapper
made her generate

37:09.170 --> 37:11.790
a false flood map for
part of Brooklyn.

37:12.750 --> 37:13.840
This is a list

37:13.840 --> 37:15.630
of property owners
who would benefit

37:15.630 --> 37:16.790
if that map
were adopted.

37:16.790 --> 37:18.920
Now, your company’s
name is on that list.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.710
I recognized it from when
Jimmy’s parole officer

37:21.710 --> 37:23.630
gave us your contact
information.

37:23.630 --> 37:26.460
You own a large parcel of land
in Red Hook.

37:26.460 --> 37:28.630
BELL: A rep from the
Department of City Planning

37:28.630 --> 37:30.250
told us that
the tech company Odker

37:30.250 --> 37:32.460
is considering buying
that land from you

37:32.460 --> 37:34.790
to make it the site
for their new headquarters.

37:34.790 --> 37:36.630
It’s all in
the early stages,

37:36.630 --> 37:37.790
but you stood
to make millions.

37:37.790 --> 37:40.670
That is, until FEMA released
their new flood maps

37:40.670 --> 37:41.800
for community review
last month.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.790
Your property was suddenly
gonna be in a high-risk zone,

37:45.790 --> 37:46.960
which not only
meant the site

37:46.960 --> 37:49.000
would be subject
to higher insurance rates,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.960
it represented an actual
high risk of flood damage.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.050
GREGSON: You knew that if
that map became official,

37:55.050 --> 37:57.670
Odker would probably
back out of the deal.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.790
But you also knew
that FEMA allows the public

37:59.790 --> 38:03.250
to appeal the maps
by submitting revised data.

38:03.250 --> 38:06.380
BELL: So you reached out
to an ex-con you knew--

38:06.380 --> 38:07.460
Jimmy Cantrell.

38:07.460 --> 38:08.790
Together, you kidnapped Lily

38:08.790 --> 38:10.710
and forced her to fake
the math you needed

38:10.710 --> 38:12.790
to put your property back
in a low-risk zone.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.800
WATSON:
Asking for ransom was
never part of the plan.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.500
Jimmy came up with that
on his own.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.920
If he hadn’t,
you probably could have

38:18.920 --> 38:20.590
finished with Lily
and then killed her

38:20.590 --> 38:23.550
before anyone realized
that she was abducted.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.000
You caved in his skull.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.790
This is crazy.

38:26.790 --> 38:29.550
How do I even know
this Lily girl that...?

38:29.550 --> 38:31.920
She mentioned she’d been
to the city’s Floodplain Office

38:31.920 --> 38:34.670
to look at some of the work
behind the real maps.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.000
We showed your photo around.
Someone recognized you.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.880
He said that you had been
in the same day as Lily.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.420
You were upset
about the new maps.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.170
We’re guessing
that you overheard her

38:43.170 --> 38:44.170
talking about them.

38:44.170 --> 38:45.550
BELL:
A little while ago,
our guys

38:45.550 --> 38:48.300
found what we were looking for
in the basement

38:48.300 --> 38:49.460
of one of
your buildings.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.710
You tried
to clean it up,

38:50.710 --> 38:51.790
but you missed a couple hairs.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.300
DNA will take a while
to come back,

38:53.300 --> 38:56.130
but they’re a visual match
for Lily’s.

38:56.130 --> 38:58.880
"A visual match"?

38:58.880 --> 39:00.340
Do you know how many people

39:00.340 --> 39:02.790
come and go
through my buildings?

39:02.790 --> 39:04.500
And even if this hair

39:04.500 --> 39:08.630
is from the kidnapped girl,
you said Jimmy was involved.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.670
So, he has her hair on him,

39:10.670 --> 39:13.420
I walk through his apartment
the other day...

39:13.420 --> 39:16.790
what do the lawyers call that?
"Transfer"?

39:16.790 --> 39:17.790
It’s true.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.790
Your lawyer could try
that argument

39:19.790 --> 39:20.800
in front of a jury.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.920
But our guys also found

39:21.920 --> 39:23.790
a fresh stain on the floor.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.790
We didn’t need DNA
to identify it.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.790
Its smell
is pretty distinct.

39:28.790 --> 39:31.000
It’s Biorade energy drink.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.790
Kiwi-flavored.

39:32.790 --> 39:36.130
The kind you brought Lily
to help her work.

39:36.790 --> 39:39.090
GREGSON:
So you tell us,
Mr. Hathaway,

39:39.090 --> 39:42.750
still want to take your chances
with a jury?

39:44.750 --> 39:46.670
(knocking at door)

39:49.210 --> 39:51.170
Hey.

39:51.170 --> 39:53.050
Come on in.

39:55.670 --> 39:58.250
Did I, uh, miss a text from you?

39:58.250 --> 40:00.380
No, just thought
I’d pop by.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.920
Well, your timing
is perfect.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.880
I just got off work.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.420
Need help with a case?

40:06.420 --> 40:07.840
Uh, no, actually
just finished one.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.790
(chuckles)
My docket is clear.

40:10.790 --> 40:11.790
Oh.

40:11.790 --> 40:14.000
Well, then you must be
looking for...

40:14.000 --> 40:16.790
How did you put it
the other day?

40:16.790 --> 40:18.420
"A potent distraction"?

40:18.420 --> 40:19.630
(chuckles)

40:19.630 --> 40:20.840
Uh, no, I was actually wondering

40:20.840 --> 40:24.920
if I might, uh,
take you to dinner.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.300
W-Would that be strange?

40:29.000 --> 40:29.800
No.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.210
It’s just that you
usually only call me

40:32.210 --> 40:34.460
when you have to work
on a weird experiment.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.090
Well, it’s funny
you should use that word.

40:36.090 --> 40:41.800
’Cause, actually, tonight,
the experiment would be... us.

40:43.210 --> 40:44.090
I mean...

40:44.090 --> 40:47.550
you’ve been more than a helper
to me over the years.

40:47.550 --> 40:49.670
Y-You’ve been a...
a friend, and, um...

40:49.670 --> 40:52.590
it just occurred to me
that you might be more.

and, um, I’d just...

40:59.380 --> 41:01.130
I-I’d hate to jeopardize
the relationship

41:01.130 --> 41:02.460
that we already have,

41:02.460 --> 41:07.380
but I just thought
I-I’d be remiss if I didn’t...
