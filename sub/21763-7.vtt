here, here and here, from the queen.

but she hated my toenail showers.

to win the trophy, responsible Mort?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.002
[laughs] I feel so much better.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.464
And to think, all I needed
was this little welded piece of fake gold

with a seal on top
holding some sort of animal horn.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.182
[all grunting]

10:41.265 --> 10:45.728
Why, hello, friends.
Bow down before your queen.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.189
[stammering] Que-Que-Que-Que--

10:48.272 --> 10:49.106
Mort!

10:49.190 --> 10:51.025
No need to thank me. [grunts]

10:51.108 --> 10:54.153
How did this happen, Mort?
Who are you working for?

10:54.236 --> 10:56.906
No, it's totally legal. We got married.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.700
Speak now or forever hold...

10:59.825 --> 11:02.119
[farting]

11:05.873 --> 11:07.041
[blowing raspberries]

11:07.833 --> 11:08.918
[farting]

11:09.960 --> 11:11.379
Hold your peace.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.798
Great. He does. I do. We do.
Kiss the bride.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.965
[kisses]

11:15.508 --> 11:17.843
[moaning]

11:18.594 --> 11:21.180
I'm King Julien. The real King Julien.

11:21.263 --> 11:25.101
Mort is not the king.
We're not even sure what species he is.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.105
That's true.
I'm a bit of a medical marvel.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.981
I think my dad was a bear.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.984
Mort, just abdicate, or whatever,

11:34.068 --> 11:35.277
so I can have my throne back.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.321
[chuckles]

11:37.405 --> 11:38.572
And my crown.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.826
I'm afraid Mort stepping down
from the throne won't help you.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.161
Will it, Mordecai?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.079
I don't know.

11:45.663 --> 11:49.250
There is no way this can be legal.
Let me just unroll this--

11:49.917 --> 11:50.835
Sorry, chubster.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.628
Let me just read you the fine print, here.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.381
"If the temporary king marries,
it is legally binding."

11:55.464 --> 11:59.051
Which means, if Mort abdicates,
I'll be the sole ruler of your kingdom.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.261
Your queen!

12:00.344 --> 12:03.556
-Que-- Que--
-And you will all bow down before me.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.392
[laughs maniacally]

12:08.978 --> 12:10.396
-Eh...
-[continues laughing]

12:10.479 --> 12:11.939
[all gasp]

12:13.941 --> 12:15.359
She's right, Your Majesty.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.278
We're gonna have to find another way
to get rid of her.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.863
Time for you to go now.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.908
[Willie screaming]

12:25.453 --> 12:29.457
Oh, no, the aggressive dolphins are back!

12:29.540 --> 12:32.126
You should have thought of that
before you entered our party

12:32.209 --> 12:35.713
-as a cursed man!
-But I'm not cursed.

12:35.796 --> 12:39.258
Really? Then explain
why you have a monkey's paw.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.011
I have the same paws as you.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.639
Sorry, Willie, we're gonna miss you,
but those are the rules.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.224
[screams]

12:47.308 --> 12:51.770
Now, hold on, everybody. Feeding Willie
to the dolphins, it could work, sure.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.648
But we're gonna
run out of food here real soon,

12:54.732 --> 12:57.443
so, what if
we save the dolphins the trouble

12:57.526 --> 13:00.029
and, you know, eat Willie ourselves?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.156
[gasps]

13:02.239 --> 13:05.576
Man's got a point.
I mean, I skipped breakfast, y'all.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.745
This lemur's hungry, baby.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.624
Well, what are we waiting for?
Reel him in, people. It's feeding time.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.250
[whimpers]

13:16.712 --> 13:17.796
[Clover] Hmm.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.673
I could take her out, Your Majesty.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.134
-Make it look like an accident.
-[whimpering]

13:22.218 --> 13:25.804
I've got an even better idea.
Make it look like it was an accident.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.641
-[groans]
-I know exactly what to do.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.809
[Clover] Ambush!

13:30.893 --> 13:32.061
[roars]

13:34.271 --> 13:36.440
[enthralling music playing]

13:44.990 --> 13:46.575
[grunting]

13:47.076 --> 13:48.118
Ow, ow, ow!

13:48.619 --> 13:49.453
[grunting]

13:51.330 --> 13:53.791
Let me know when Pam's, you know, gone.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.376
-[giggles]
-Uh...

13:55.459 --> 13:58.379
Pam took Clover out. Like, really badly.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.672
Huh?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.757
-[Clover grunting]
-[chuckles]

14:01.840 --> 14:02.716
Chicka... What?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.926
What now, Your Majesty?

14:04.009 --> 14:07.721
Don't worry. I've got a backup plan.
[laughs] Watch out.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.224
[Mort humming]

14:10.307 --> 14:11.600
[bird cooing]

14:11.725 --> 14:13.185
[screeching]

14:13.352 --> 14:15.187
-[both] Hmm?
-[humming]

14:24.822 --> 14:26.115
[shrieks]

14:26.198 --> 14:30.244
Oh, man. I promised I'd give Sage
his hawk back alive and well.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.371
[Sage screaming]

14:32.454 --> 14:36.458
No! No! No! No! No!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.460
It will not end here.

14:38.544 --> 14:43.674
[inhaling] Not for you,
[inhaling] brave warrior!

14:44.133 --> 14:46.051
[exhaling]

14:51.849 --> 14:54.810
Brave warrior!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.770
Let me massage your majestic aorta.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.607
Yes. Don't fight,
open your ventricles to me.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.401
That's it. Smells weird in here.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.447
Sadness is but the mechanism
of a winding clock

15:06.530 --> 15:10.242
frozen at two in the morning,
gestating magical tears

15:10.326 --> 15:13.621
that have the power... to heal.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.124
Uh...

15:18.334 --> 15:19.960
-[screeches]
-[grunts]

15:20.753 --> 15:23.422
It is I, the Moondancer.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.466
-Let's fly.
-[screeching]

15:26.050 --> 15:27.343
Wow, man.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.510
[screeches]

15:28.636 --> 15:30.012
Did you see that, Mo-Mo?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.891
Yeah, and I might not be able
to un-see it. [groans]

15:33.974 --> 15:36.685
Man, it's too bad Mort
wasn't already married.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.605
Could have saved us
a whole bunch of trouble.

15:39.688 --> 15:43.108
Oh! Well, I'm going
to un-trouble us, Maurice.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.693
Because I'm getting...

15:44.777 --> 15:45.694
[grunting]

15:45.778 --> 15:48.697
Yep, one of my sick, nasty KJ ideas.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.618
Maybe Mort was already married.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.079
-To me! [laughs]
-Huh?

15:55.162 --> 15:58.374
Okay, I'm feeling really uncomfortable
right now.

15:58.457 --> 16:02.211
Mo-Mo, it's time for a transformation!

16:02.336 --> 16:04.129
[peppy song playing]

16:43.544 --> 16:44.712
Oh...

16:44.795 --> 16:51.468
Well, I never! Mordecai, you scamp.
I, your long-suffering wife, Tilda,

16:51.552 --> 16:55.347
who you married legally, have been looking
all over the kingdom for--

16:55.431 --> 16:56.765
Hello, ex-King Julien.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.809
What? How did you... Ugh!

16:59.393 --> 17:03.230
Do you have any idea how long it took me
to put all this stuff on?

17:03.313 --> 17:05.441
I mean, my nails! And just...

17:05.566 --> 17:06.692
[grunts]

17:06.775 --> 17:10.070
First of all, yes, I do.
Second of all, that's right.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.989
I saw right through your little plan.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.908
You're too late,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.994
I am still queen!

17:17.077 --> 17:18.328
[laughs]

17:18.412 --> 17:21.248
Que-que-que-que-- [gulps]

17:21.331 --> 17:24.585
Ugh! I wish I could
angrily pace right now.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.463
I'm gonna figure out who this "Pam" is.

17:27.546 --> 17:32.301
Uh... Clover, you've got something
on your... lower back area.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.970
-Wait, on my th... Is it... What?
-It looks like a handprint.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.723
[gasps] It's Pam's! From when she...

17:37.806 --> 17:40.601
Well, when, you know, she kind of,
sort of, beat me up, or whatever.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.436
I need that handprint. Maurice!

17:42.519 --> 17:43.896
What do you want me to do?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.315
Wax it.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.318
I'm not waxing your... that!
You're gonna kill me!

17:49.401 --> 17:51.445
Maurice, come on. It's for the king.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.322
I need that handprint
to identify the woman

17:53.405 --> 17:54.740
-who's taken over the kingdom.
-[whimpering]

17:56.075 --> 17:59.161
-Promise you won't hurt me?
-Yes. I promise.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.829
[whimpering]

18:01.080 --> 18:02.790
[both whimpering]

18:03.415 --> 18:04.541
-[grunts]
-[screams]

18:05.042 --> 18:07.169
-Hurts so... bad!
-[Maurice grunting]

18:07.920 --> 18:08.837
It hurt me!

18:10.422 --> 18:11.381
[Clover] Sorry.

18:11.965 --> 18:12.841
If my instincts are right,

18:12.925 --> 18:15.302
this book of Madagascar's
criminal mastermind handprints

18:15.385 --> 18:16.720
will have the answer.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.555
Nope. Nope. Nope. [gasps]

18:18.639 --> 18:21.100
Well, 'ello, 'ello, 'ello.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.353
Maurice, enhance. Enhance.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.356
You're not making the enhance noise.
Maurice.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.440
[groans]

18:28.524 --> 18:29.566
Bleep-blap-bloob.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.652
Beep-bab-blab-beep-blap

18:31.735 --> 18:34.238
I'm surrounded by crazy people.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.366
Aha! Gotcha, Pam.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.617
[Maurice grunting]

18:39.576 --> 18:40.661
[crashes]

18:40.744 --> 18:42.955
[giggles] Sorry.

18:43.455 --> 18:47.209
What I'm thinking is,
we'll start with an amuse-bouche.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.961
-What's he talking about?
-Amuse who?

18:49.044 --> 18:50.963
-I don't know who he's... Who is this guy?
-I ain't amused, man.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.006
An amuse-bouche.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.591
Bouche!

18:55.092 --> 18:57.803
-[slurping]
-Bouche!

18:59.263 --> 19:01.890
It's hurting my ears.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.144
Fine. If that doesn't toot your tussle,
we can stew him up

19:05.227 --> 19:09.231
into a nice beef bourguignon,
with a side of pickled sweet gherkins.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.860
Take your gherkins and scram!
I say we eat him raw.

19:12.943 --> 19:13.777
-[all cheering]
-[screams]

19:14.194 --> 19:16.655
-Eat him raw!
-Bunch of Philistines.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.283
Eat him raw, for all I care.
I'd rather starve.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.492
[all grunting]

19:20.617 --> 19:22.327
[laughing]

19:22.411 --> 19:25.455
You know what, Pam?
Fine, keep your stupid crown.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.624
Too bad you have to be married
to that guy.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.042
[grunts]

19:29.209 --> 19:31.503
Ha! He touches me, he dies.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.214
In the meantime,
I'll steal this kingdom blind.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.967
By the time I'm done, your kingdom
will have nothing to its name

19:37.050 --> 19:38.552
but the fur on your peoples' butts.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.054
In fact, I think I might take that too.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.973
[laughs]

19:43.765 --> 19:45.559
[Clover panting] Ta!

19:46.310 --> 19:51.356
Not so fast, Pam.
Or should I call you "Stephanie Jeeves"?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.359
Or is it "Lily Teeterwagon"?

19:54.443 --> 19:57.196
Whatever her name is,
she can't be legally married to Mort,

19:57.279 --> 20:00.824
because she's already married
to all of these guys.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.038
Pam is a con artist, Your Majesty.
She marries royals,

20:06.121 --> 20:08.624
strips their kingdoms bare,
and then, leaves them with nothing.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.083
[sobbing]

20:10.209 --> 20:13.795
Who's Pam?
I thought you loved me, Stephanie.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.257
Ha! Are you kidding me? Love you?
You could barely even hug me.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.010
Well, that's because
you took all of our arm extensions.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.679
We need those for hugging!

20:22.763 --> 20:24.473
[sobbing]

20:24.556 --> 20:28.393
Our wedding cost
the entire kingdom's supply of nectar.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.811
[blows]

20:38.487 --> 20:40.948
I'm... married?

20:41.031 --> 20:43.325
You were the easiest one, Joey.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.244
I'm married?

20:45.744 --> 20:48.121
-Even Hans? I mean, Hans?
-[grunts]

20:48.205 --> 20:50.332
-He's not even a king.
-[bawling]

20:50.415 --> 20:53.835
Maybe not, but... he sure knows
how to treat a lady.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.462
Ooh!

20:59.424 --> 21:02.719
Hans, you're back!
I may have lost King Julien

21:02.803 --> 21:07.474
as my wife/husband, but at least
I have you back in my life.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.184
[laughs]

21:10.269 --> 21:12.020
Right. Anyways...

21:12.104 --> 21:15.315
Since Pam's already married
to multiple people,

21:15.399 --> 21:17.192
she can't be legally married to Mort.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.070
Which means the crown is still yours,
Your Majesty.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.905
And not yours! [grunts]

21:22.406 --> 21:24.199
-Hmm!
-I see.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.451
[laughing]

21:26.618 --> 21:27.577
[grunts]

21:28.662 --> 21:32.749
You might be faster than me, Pam,
but you're not smarter.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.751
What do you want me to do with her,
Your Majesty?

21:34.835 --> 21:40.507
Well, I do know a certain someone
who's looking for a new... patient.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.259
[thrilling music playing]

21:45.095 --> 21:45.929
Yes.

21:46.930 --> 21:52.269
Her head will look perfect
attached to a [shouts] shark!

21:52.936 --> 21:55.814
So, doctor, eh? You married?

21:56.898 --> 21:57.774
[hisses]

21:58.817 --> 22:00.152
[all grunting]

22:03.447 --> 22:07.784
It's okay, babe. Frank forgives you.
You're just tryin' to survive.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.829
Yeah, your wings are too weak to fly.
