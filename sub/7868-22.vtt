01:30.687 --> 01:33.489
People of Springfield,
this town is in the worst

01:33.556 --> 01:35.257
financial meltdown
we've ever seen.

01:35.325 --> 01:38.127
No longer can we cook the books
and fudge the numbers.

01:38.194 --> 01:40.162
Mmm. (drools)

01:40.230 --> 01:41.396
This is serious.

01:41.464 --> 01:43.298
Pay attention.

01:44.467 --> 01:45.300
(giddy laughter)

01:47.937 --> 01:49.905
Oh, yeah...

01:49.973 --> 01:51.607
And so, it is with regret

01:51.674 --> 01:53.709
I announce the following
cost-cutting measures:

01:53.776 --> 01:56.311
<i>eliminating</i>
<i>dead animal pickup...</i>

02:03.520 --> 02:05.087
(Krusty grunts)

02:05.155 --> 02:08.389
<i>...dramatic cutbacks</i>
<i>in our education budget...</i>

02:09.792 --> 02:11.460
Good morning, children.

02:11.528 --> 02:13.395
Today, we are instituting
shortened school hours.

02:13.463 --> 02:14.596
How shortened?

02:14.664 --> 02:15.898
Take 'em home, Otto.

02:15.965 --> 02:17.633
(children cheering)

02:17.700 --> 02:19.535
<i>...and we have released</i>

02:19.602 --> 02:21.436
<i>all low-level criminals</i>
<i>from our prisons.</i>

02:25.475 --> 02:26.341
(snickers)

02:35.785 --> 02:37.486
(gun cocks)

02:37.554 --> 02:40.289
Spit the grapes back in
with the others.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.427
Homie, slow down.

02:45.495 --> 02:46.695
Why should I?

02:46.763 --> 02:48.463
The city's broke.

02:48.531 --> 02:50.399
They can't afford to enforce
their precious laws.

02:50.466 --> 02:51.567
(horn honking)

02:55.038 --> 02:56.438
How fast
were they going, Lou?

02:56.506 --> 02:57.739
I don't know, Chief.

02:57.807 --> 02:59.241
We can't afford
a radar gun,

02:59.309 --> 03:00.442
so we're just
using a thermos

03:00.510 --> 03:02.110
on top of a hose handle.

03:02.178 --> 03:04.179
Well, it's better
than my pistol.

03:04.247 --> 03:05.681
Hey, hey, uh,
that Ralphie's

03:05.748 --> 03:08.383
getting to be
a pretty fine artist.

03:08.451 --> 03:09.718
I drew it.

03:09.786 --> 03:11.987
Hmm. Mm-hm.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.435
Another Springfield family

03:26.502 --> 03:29.137
moves to Detroit
to find a better life.

03:29.205 --> 03:31.940
Now that it's empty, who's
going to buy their house?

03:32.008 --> 03:34.243
What if someone moves
in with two Barts?

03:34.310 --> 03:36.845
Or four teenage Barts?

03:36.913 --> 03:38.680
(engines revving)

03:38.748 --> 03:41.149
Eh, at least they're learning
their fractions.

03:41.217 --> 03:42.618
(worried groan)

03:50.693 --> 03:52.961
(sniffs) What's that
delicious smell?

03:53.029 --> 03:54.463
Cookies!

03:54.530 --> 03:56.265
(sniffs)
Mmm.

03:56.332 --> 03:58.233
Stop that sniffing.
It's not for you.

03:58.301 --> 04:01.303
They're making the house
next door smell like cookies

04:01.371 --> 04:03.805
so people will subconsciously
want to buy it.

04:03.873 --> 04:05.707
Oh, come on.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.609
What kind of big, fat moron
would fall for...

04:07.677 --> 04:08.977
(sniffs)
Cookies!

04:09.045 --> 04:10.479
So delicious.
Must buy house.

04:10.546 --> 04:11.880
Homer, no!

04:11.948 --> 04:13.915
Marge, get loan
preapproved.

04:13.983 --> 04:15.183
Offer over asking.

04:15.251 --> 04:17.653
Waive inspections.
Two-day escrow!

04:17.720 --> 04:20.322
Initial the radon disclosure.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.957
And done.

04:22.024 --> 04:24.026
Sorry. Someone else
has bought the house.

04:24.093 --> 04:27.095
But my loan has already been
sold in pieces to banks,

04:27.163 --> 04:29.898
hedge funds and municipalities
across the globe.

04:34.370 --> 04:36.071
Death to Homer!

04:36.139 --> 04:37.939
At least we'll
always have <i>Beowulf.</i>

04:38.007 --> 04:39.041
That's not us.

04:39.108 --> 04:40.676
Oh, no!

04:41.844 --> 04:43.278
A credenza?

04:44.547 --> 04:46.448
Credenza?!

04:47.684 --> 04:49.785
Lowboy? Sideboard?

04:49.852 --> 04:51.987
Portmanteau?

04:52.055 --> 04:53.455
Mom, it's so superficial
to judge

04:53.523 --> 04:56.758
our new neighbor
based on his furniture.

04:56.826 --> 04:59.361
(gasps)
He drives a hybrid!

04:59.429 --> 05:01.296
LISA:
He's got koi!

05:01.364 --> 05:02.831
(sighs happily)

05:02.899 --> 05:04.566
And where there's
exotic fish,

05:04.634 --> 05:05.967
there's got
to be a...

05:06.035 --> 05:07.569
BOTH:
Water feature.

05:07.637 --> 05:09.471
Dames. (groans)

05:09.539 --> 05:12.708
Well, I'm gonna go introduce
myself Bart Simpson-style.

05:12.775 --> 05:14.276
(hawks and spits)

05:14.344 --> 05:15.644
Yo. Bart Simpson.

05:15.712 --> 05:17.179
No doubt you
read about me

05:17.246 --> 05:19.247
in your nuisance
neighbor disclosure.

05:19.315 --> 05:20.382
SIDESHOW BOB VOICE:
Hello, Bart.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.683
Huh? Say that again.

05:21.751 --> 05:23.685
Hello, Bart.

05:23.753 --> 05:24.686
Hello, Bart.

05:24.754 --> 05:25.687
Hello, Bart.

05:25.755 --> 05:27.022
Hello, Bart!

05:27.090 --> 05:29.291
Hello, Bart.

05:29.359 --> 05:31.326
Hello, BART.

05:31.394 --> 05:32.327
(screams)

05:32.395 --> 05:33.962
Sideshow Bob!

05:34.030 --> 05:35.130
Side what whom?

05:35.198 --> 05:36.732
(screaming)

05:41.983 --> 05:44.118
(hammering)

05:44.125 --> 05:46.326
Man, you're good with
the tools when you
want to be.

05:46.394 --> 05:47.761
Why on earth
do you think

05:47.828 --> 05:50.196
that harmless-looking man
is Sideshow Bob?

05:50.264 --> 05:52.499
BART:
I know he doesn't
look like him,

05:52.566 --> 05:54.768
but I'll never forget
that voice.

05:54.835 --> 05:57.737
A lot of people sound
like Sideshow Bob.

05:57.805 --> 05:59.639
Like Frasier on <i>Cheers.</i>

05:59.707 --> 06:01.741
Or Frasier on <i>Frasier.</i>

06:01.809 --> 06:04.911
Or Lieutenant Commander
Tom Dodge in <i>Down Periscope.</i>

06:04.979 --> 06:07.213
Look, I'm telling you,
no matter who he says he is,

06:07.281 --> 06:09.282
he's really Sideshow Bob.

06:09.350 --> 06:11.785
Honey, his name
is Walt Warren,

06:11.852 --> 06:13.787
and he's a very nice man.

06:13.854 --> 06:15.455
He stopped me from driving away

06:15.523 --> 06:17.357
with my coffee cup
on top of the car.

06:17.425 --> 06:18.792
Ah.

06:18.859 --> 06:20.393
Really? Hmm.

06:20.461 --> 06:21.961
Maybe I...

06:22.029 --> 06:24.264
(screams) Sideshow Bob!

06:28.269 --> 06:29.636
(sighs)

06:29.703 --> 06:30.970
(chuckles)

06:31.038 --> 06:32.939
Stupid kid,
fooled by a silhouette.

06:35.443 --> 06:36.576
(gasps) Ooh.

06:38.279 --> 06:39.979
Eh... (gasps)

06:40.047 --> 06:42.215
Ice cream?!

06:42.283 --> 06:45.452
Oh, nothing is ever boobs
or ice cream.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.224
I'll prove
I'm not crazy.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.226
Sideshow Bob could never
resist singing along

06:53.294 --> 06:55.495
to a Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta.

06:55.563 --> 06:57.063
Who am I again?

06:57.131 --> 06:58.765
Yum Yum.
I'm Peep-bo.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.635
Mom, Dad, I got the lead!

07:02.703 --> 07:04.737

07:16.350 --> 07:18.351
We need a third maid.

07:18.419 --> 07:21.488

will step in and help.

Sorry, gentlemen.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.869
I'm not a fan of that
particular style of music.

07:35.936 --> 07:39.239
My radio dial never strays
from 89.4 "The Spur."

07:39.306 --> 07:40.874
It is a good
station, Bart,

07:40.941 --> 07:42.308
what with the
Morning Cattle Drive

07:42.376 --> 07:44.277
and Armadillo Mike
in the afternoon.

07:44.345 --> 07:46.179
And nothing
keeps me informed

07:46.247 --> 07:49.115
like Rodeo Rick's
Ne Roundup

07:49.183 --> 07:50.483
every hour on the...

07:50.551 --> 07:52.819
Shut up.

07:52.887 --> 07:56.222
I just want to say, I've
not only found new neighbors,

07:56.290 --> 07:58.291
but gained new friends.

07:58.359 --> 08:03.029
And from now on, Wi-Fi
in this neighborhood is on me.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.864
(all gasp)

08:04.932 --> 08:07.433
Ooh, that book I ordered
is going to be delayed.

08:09.703 --> 08:11.171
(grunts)

08:11.238 --> 08:13.173
All right, Walt Warren.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.475
Let's see who you really are.

08:15.543 --> 08:16.776
<i>Harmless World,</i>

08:16.844 --> 08:18.077
<i>Mild Manners,</i>

08:18.145 --> 08:19.546
<i>Not Mad Magazine,</i>

08:19.613 --> 08:20.847
<i>Nap Fancy,</i>

08:20.915 --> 08:22.315
<i>Calm, Comfortable,</i>

08:22.383 --> 08:23.983
a "Cuddly Puppies" calendar.

08:24.051 --> 08:27.053
Aw, little guy can't get out
of the pumpkin.

08:27.121 --> 08:29.289
(grumbles)
There must be something here.

08:29.356 --> 08:32.025
Something, something, something.

08:32.092 --> 08:33.193
MARGE:
Bart?
(startled shout)

08:33.260 --> 08:34.894
What are you doing?

08:34.962 --> 08:36.229
You're indoors at
an outdoor party.

08:36.297 --> 08:37.730
Walt is Sideshow Bob,

08:37.798 --> 08:39.332
and I'm going to prove it.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.534
Look.
Who needs a knife this big?

08:41.602 --> 08:44.236
It's probably a deboner.

08:44.305 --> 08:46.839
(chuckles) Boner.

08:46.907 --> 08:48.708
Mom, I'm scared.
(groans)

08:48.776 --> 08:52.979
I can see there's only one way
to settle this once and for all.

08:55.616 --> 08:57.317
Okay ma'am, Sideshow Bob's cell

08:57.384 --> 08:59.118
is all the way
at the end.

08:59.186 --> 09:01.788
Walk fast and don't call
attention to yourself.

09:01.855 --> 09:04.857
Pretty lady in a strapless dress
coming through!

09:04.925 --> 09:06.426
Oh, yeah!
Come here, woman!

09:06.493 --> 09:09.762
If you were my wife,
I never would've killed you!

09:09.830 --> 09:11.531
Thank you.
You're very sweet.

09:11.599 --> 09:13.099
Nothing is holding up
the dress!

09:13.934 --> 09:16.102
Only her melons!

09:16.170 --> 09:17.303
And here we are.

09:17.371 --> 09:19.339
Sideshow Bob.

09:19.406 --> 09:22.108
(gasps)

09:22.176 --> 09:23.776
(grunts)
I can't see.

09:23.844 --> 09:25.345
Oh, here you go.

09:25.412 --> 09:27.280
Huh?

09:27.348 --> 09:28.781
BART:
That <i>is</i> Bob.

09:28.849 --> 09:30.350
Guess I was wrong.

09:30.417 --> 09:33.186
(gibbering)

09:33.254 --> 09:35.221
We better go.

09:35.289 --> 09:37.290
Pretty lady coming back!

09:37.358 --> 09:39.058
Aw, yeah... yeah!

09:39.126 --> 09:40.793
Come here, baby.
Walkin'...

09:40.861 --> 09:43.563
Guys, guys, I'm married.

09:43.631 --> 09:45.832
You are?
So sorry.

09:52.473 --> 09:55.041
(gagging)

09:55.609 --> 09:56.976
(gasps)

10:00.014 --> 10:01.814
(electrical buzzing)

10:05.519 --> 10:07.153
(siren wailing)

10:08.922 --> 10:10.490
(dogs barking)

10:24.171 --> 10:27.073
(snoring, muttering)

10:35.215 --> 10:37.817
Great day to be alive.

10:40.254 --> 10:42.055
Morning, Marge.
(screams)

10:42.122 --> 10:44.257
Hope I didn't interrupt
your <i>petite dejeuner.</i>

10:44.325 --> 10:45.858
Look, I feel terrible
that Bart and I

10:45.926 --> 10:47.427
got off on the
wrong foot,

10:47.494 --> 10:49.762
and I have an extra ticket
to today's baseball game.

10:49.830 --> 10:51.431
Bart, care to come?

10:51.498 --> 10:53.633
They're playing
Spokane.

10:53.701 --> 10:55.268
The Cascades?

10:55.336 --> 10:57.737
They totally stole the
Federal Cup from us last year.

10:57.805 --> 10:59.238
Can I go, Mom? Can I?

10:59.306 --> 11:00.673
Is your room clean?
No.

11:00.741 --> 11:02.141
Good. That'll give me
something to do

11:02.209 --> 11:03.543
while you're at the game.

11:09.383 --> 11:12.885
Marge, the bathroom
scale is lying again.

11:14.688 --> 11:16.356
(screaming)

11:19.226 --> 11:21.394
All right, buddy,
I'm gonna do to you

11:21.462 --> 11:24.330
what you should have done
to my son a long time ago.

11:24.398 --> 11:25.932
(high-pitched voice):
I'm not Sideshow Bob.

11:25.999 --> 11:28.101
I'm the real Walt Warren.

11:28.168 --> 11:30.303
But that's impossible.

11:30.371 --> 11:32.338
If you're the
real Walt Warren,

11:32.406 --> 11:34.607
who's taking our son to the
baseball game right now?

11:36.343 --> 11:39.212
Uh, you missed the turn-off,
Mr. Warren.

11:39.279 --> 11:41.547
You don't have to call
me Mr. Warren anymore.

11:41.615 --> 11:43.649
You see, Bart,
you were right all along.

11:46.854 --> 11:49.355
I am... Sideshow Bob.

11:49.423 --> 11:51.290
(screaming)
(evil laughter)

11:51.358 --> 11:54.227
And now I am free to sing

11:54.294 --> 11:57.463
all the Gilbert and Sullivan
I damn well please.

11:57.531 --> 12:01.367
♪ Behold the lord
high executioner ♪

12:01.435 --> 12:04.036
♪ A personage of noble rank
and title... ♪

12:04.104 --> 12:06.105
(humming tune)

12:13.793 --> 12:15.294
Hmm...

12:15.709 --> 12:16.909
Hmm...?

12:17.407 --> 12:19.376
I'll prove I'm
telling the truth.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.927
Bob has huge feet, right?

12:20.995 --> 12:22.396
Well, look...

12:23.531 --> 12:24.531
You see?

12:24.599 --> 12:25.766
(all gasping)

12:25.833 --> 12:28.268
It's like you're
a Chinese empress.

12:28.336 --> 12:30.704
You see, I was Bob's cellmate.

12:30.772 --> 12:33.340
My new cellmate, Walt Warren,

12:33.408 --> 12:35.075
was the perfect
candidate for my plan.

12:35.143 --> 12:36.977
He had the same build as me--

12:37.045 --> 12:39.579
lacking only my regal
bearing and leonine grace.

12:41.549 --> 12:46.119
As a minor offender, he was
scheduled for early release.

12:52.894 --> 12:56.496
Say, Bob, why do you
keep measuring my face?

12:56.564 --> 12:58.699
Just passing the time, bunky.

12:58.766 --> 13:02.235
Well, I guess it beats
what the last guy did.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.004
Well, nighty-night.

13:04.072 --> 13:06.006
And nighty-night to you.

13:09.744 --> 13:12.279
(thunder crashing)

13:12.347 --> 13:14.014
SIDESHOW BOB:
<i>I began by removing</i>
<i>Walt's face.</i>

13:19.354 --> 13:21.088
Five-second rule.

13:21.155 --> 13:22.856
<i>That was the easy part.</i>

13:22.924 --> 13:25.258
<i>The hard part was</i>
<i>removing my own face.</i>

13:25.326 --> 13:29.996
<i>Luckily, as Krusty's sidekick,</i>
<i>I'd been hit with so many pies</i>

13:30.064 --> 13:32.199
<i>that my face had lost</i>
<i>all sensation.</i>

13:32.266 --> 13:33.533
(screams in pain)

13:33.601 --> 13:34.868
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

13:34.936 --> 13:36.803
(screaming)

13:41.309 --> 13:43.510
(thunder crashing)

13:43.578 --> 13:46.713
<i>The final reattachment</i>
<i>was a mere bagatelle.</i>

13:46.781 --> 13:48.248
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

13:48.316 --> 13:49.416
(sighs)

13:52.553 --> 13:54.254
<i>They returned Walt's</i>
<i>possessions to me.</i>

13:54.322 --> 13:56.356
Keys, cell phone,

13:56.424 --> 13:58.425
$143,000.

13:58.493 --> 13:59.593
Oh!

13:59.660 --> 14:01.428
It was only $27,000
when you came in,

14:01.496 --> 14:03.130
but we invested it well.

14:03.197 --> 14:05.465
Would you like a commission?
Not allowed.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.601
<i>And I walked out</i>
<i>free as a bird.</i>

14:12.240 --> 14:16.143
I bought the house next
to you, and here we are.

14:16.210 --> 14:19.079
So I just have to kill
you, then sell the house.

14:19.147 --> 14:21.181
Selling the house
will be murder.

14:21.249 --> 14:24.050
You could just rent it
till the market recovers...

14:24.118 --> 14:25.652
which'll be never.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.020
(evil laughter)

14:29.724 --> 14:33.293
Walt, why didn't you tell
your story to the guards?

14:33.361 --> 14:36.496
Well, I tried to, but I had
trouble moving my new lips.

14:36.564 --> 14:38.265
They heard me babbling,

14:38.332 --> 14:42.002
thought I was crazy,
and threw me into a padded cell.

14:42.069 --> 14:45.972
<i>I tried to warn you by writing</i>
<i>"Bart Simpson will die"</i>

14:46.040 --> 14:48.275
<i>on the walls,</i>
<i>but you ignored me.</i>

14:48.342 --> 14:51.411
You have to admit,
"Bart Simpson Will Die"

14:51.479 --> 14:53.213
was kind of open
to interpretation.

14:53.281 --> 14:54.881
I'm not a writer.

14:54.949 --> 14:57.384
And I'm not a locksmith.

15:06.127 --> 15:09.162
Man, that dude
does not like Bart.

15:09.230 --> 15:11.364
(gasps) I know where
Bob's taking Bart.

15:21.642 --> 15:23.243
Another cup of
coffee, handsome?

15:23.311 --> 15:25.111
It's on the house.

15:25.179 --> 15:28.215
Well, that's kind of you, Joyce,
but caffeine makes me jittery,

15:28.282 --> 15:31.318
and I have a task ahead of me
which requires a firm hand.

15:31.385 --> 15:35.222
Ooh, I like a man
with a firm hand.

15:35.289 --> 15:38.158
Hey, looks like you've got a
loose thread on your collar.

15:38.226 --> 15:39.659
No, don't.

15:39.727 --> 15:41.361
(screams)

15:41.429 --> 15:44.698
My face. My beautiful,
borrowed face.

15:47.235 --> 15:49.369
Come back!

15:49.437 --> 15:51.505
I don't care
if you don't have a face.

15:51.572 --> 15:54.374
I just need something warm
to cuddle at night!

15:54.442 --> 15:56.910
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?

15:56.978 --> 15:59.212
Yeah, I've seen him.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.182
He, uh, said
he was driving down to Mexico.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.216
Mexico?!

16:03.284 --> 16:04.284
<i>ándale!  ándale!</i>

16:04.352 --> 16:05.252
<i>Arriba!</i>

16:05.319 --> 16:06.486
I don't believe her.

16:06.554 --> 16:08.855
I think she fell in love
with my face,

16:08.923 --> 16:10.957
and she's trying
to throw us off the scent.

16:11.025 --> 16:13.460
Walt, it's a nice face,

16:13.528 --> 16:17.497
but I don't think it would drive
a professional waitress to lie.

16:17.565 --> 16:19.165
Well, fine. You go to Mexico.

16:19.233 --> 16:20.634
I'm going to Five Corners.

16:22.036 --> 16:23.970
Hey, handsome.

16:24.038 --> 16:26.039
Is that a loose
thread on your collar?

16:31.312 --> 16:35.081
All the good men are either gay
or have no face.

16:37.685 --> 16:39.319
Welcome to the
Five Corners,

16:39.387 --> 16:41.488
the only geographic
location in the U.S.

16:41.556 --> 16:43.156
where five states meet,

16:43.224 --> 16:45.692
and where
you will meet your doom.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.160
Come on, Bob.

16:47.228 --> 16:48.662
You don't need
to kill me.

16:48.729 --> 16:50.230
I'll probably
kill myself pretty soon

16:50.298 --> 16:52.232
with all
the stupid things I do.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.934
Oh, no!
I swallowed my tongue!

16:54.001 --> 16:56.269
(gagging)

16:58.606 --> 16:59.873
Yes, I would
be a fool.

16:59.941 --> 17:01.341
Unless I did it here,

17:01.409 --> 17:04.243
where your murder
will be unprosecutable.

17:06.213 --> 17:08.815
You know, the great ones
can kill without explaining.

17:08.883 --> 17:11.785
I can stand in one state,
fire a gun in a second state.

17:11.852 --> 17:14.588
<i>The bullet will travel through</i>
<i>the third, hitting you</i>

17:14.655 --> 17:16.256
<i>in the fourth</i>
<i>so you fall dead in the fifth.</i>

17:16.324 --> 17:18.124
No single act
is against any law.

17:18.192 --> 17:20.993
But their sum total
is the greatest murder

17:21.061 --> 17:24.230
since Snape killed Dumbledore.

17:24.298 --> 17:26.132
Oh, I haven't gotten
to that part yet.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.634
It's a four-year-old book.

17:27.702 --> 17:29.436
I'm a slow reader.

17:29.503 --> 17:30.837
A fitting epitaph.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.341
(sighs)
It means last words.

17:34.408 --> 17:37.744
Are you here
to teach me, or to kill me?

17:37.812 --> 17:41.047
What in the name of Malcolm
Muggeridge are you doing?

17:41.115 --> 17:42.749
Ruining your plan.
If you shoot me

17:42.817 --> 17:45.318
while we're in the same state,
you go to jail.

17:45.386 --> 17:47.020
(grunting
with each step)

17:50.725 --> 17:52.425
Oh! (mutters)

17:52.493 --> 17:56.096
Fine. I'll just shoot you,
and tell people I did the plan.

17:56.163 --> 17:58.665
(grunts)

17:58.733 --> 18:00.667
Not today, Bob.

18:00.735 --> 18:03.003
See, Bob, even you
hate to see you.

18:03.070 --> 18:06.272
Now Bob, you take my face off
nice and easy

18:06.340 --> 18:08.141
and kick it over here.

18:08.209 --> 18:09.843
Oh!

18:09.910 --> 18:12.345
There's a bee under my cheek!

18:13.714 --> 18:14.581
Hey! Hey, no!

18:16.851 --> 18:18.785
Help us! Help us!
For the love of God,

18:18.853 --> 18:20.587
Won't somebody help us?

18:20.655 --> 18:22.756
<i>Sí.</i>
Uh, yes,
I'd like... um...

18:22.823 --> 18:26.126
How do you say taco
in Mexican?
Taco.

18:26.193 --> 18:28.662
Yes, that's exactly the word
I want to translate.
Taco.

18:28.729 --> 18:30.664
Homer, can we please
find Bart?
Oh, yeah,
yeah, right.

18:30.731 --> 18:33.566
Uh, just give me one of those
crispy shells with meat in it.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.001
Taco?
Oh!

18:39.524 --> 18:41.759
Walt, because
I like your face,

18:41.821 --> 18:44.089
I'll let you decide
which state I kill you in.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.158
Okay, uh... Hawaii.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.926
Choosing privilege revoked.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.762
Hold it right there,
Switches of Eastface.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.898
Switches
of Eastface?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.332
I don't want
to censor myself.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.568
That's how creativity dies.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.471
Aah! Blasted Wiggum!
How did you find us?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.674
You see, Bob, Bart was never
convinced you were Walt.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.810
<i>So before he left for the game,</i>

19:04.877 --> 19:07.379
<i>he called us and warned us</i>
<i>to track you.</i>

19:07.446 --> 19:10.182
<i>Which we were able to do</i>
<i>through the dashboard of</i>

19:10.249 --> 19:12.818
<i>you car, which, like all</i>
<i>hybrids, is secretly monitored</i>

19:12.885 --> 19:13.652
by the government.

19:13.719 --> 19:14.853
Bravo, Chief.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.054
Or should I say, Clancy?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.656
Yeah, thanks...

19:17.723 --> 19:19.791
Wait a minute--
why so familiar?

19:19.859 --> 19:23.094
Because I'm afraid you don't
have jurisdiction in this state.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.933
(in Southern accent):
Welcome to <i>my</i> jurisdiction.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.670
(with Minnesota accent):
You just, uh, go ahead

19:31.737 --> 19:34.539
and put your hands
up there, mister.

19:34.607 --> 19:38.777
(with New Jersey accent):
Oh. You got the right
to remain silent over here. Oh.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.782
We're takin' you in.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.084
But first, we're gonna make
a stop at the shore

19:46.152 --> 19:48.954
for some Skee-Ball
and funnel cakes. Oh!

19:52.058 --> 19:55.994
Oh, Bart, I am so glad
everything's okay.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.829
Well, not
everything.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.565
Apparently someone switched
your face with a butt.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.734
(laughs)

20:02.802 --> 20:04.836
(groans)

20:08.708 --> 20:10.508
Well, whoever moves in,

20:10.576 --> 20:13.245
it can't be worse than having
a murderer next door.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.648
Howdilly-dowdilly,
next-door-oonies.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.183
Howdy, Cousin Ted.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.417
Howdy do to you, Cousin Ned.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.119
How are Roddy and Toddy?

20:21.187 --> 20:23.722
Flantastic times two.
How are Connie and Bonnie?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.991
Dandy as candy,
like every good Flandy.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.059
Glad to hear it,
thank the Holy Spirit.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.563
Glad to say it, and now
the girls will "yay" it.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.032
GIRLS:
Yay.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
