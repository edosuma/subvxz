What's it called?

01:57.320 --> 01:59.263
"Why You Suck dot net."

01:59.320 --> 02:02.390
- It's a clear title.
- Are you gonna read it?

02:02.440 --> 02:06.590
- Nope.
- Our friends think it's hilarious.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.625

it with a password to people we know.

Tell me about the
moment you realized

05:08.480 --> 05:10.582
that your husband was that for you.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.147
Well, I sold real estate,

05:13.200 --> 05:16.463
so that he could
write, and I hated it.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.146
But, you know, I believed in him.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.146

to the top of this mountain

05:23.200 --> 05:25.029

I was standing up there

05:27.760 --> 05:30.340
I realized that I had
never done it with him.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.343
He was afraid of heights.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.670

admired at first.

it as his worst trait.

Poojah, it got messy,

43:35.320 --> 43:37.149
but it was all worth it.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.671
Even...

43:38.800 --> 43:40.504
after she died.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.269
Hey, don't look like that!

43:44.720 --> 43:46.663
It makes me happy
to talk about her.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.310
She's still with me.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.350
In Ravi and Pia.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.346
Having her

43:53.440 --> 43:55.861
was worth losing her.

- Nah!
- No.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.270

- Tell him!
- No!

44:36.920 --> 44:39.990
Okay! All right, okay.
There's a section on the blog

44:40.000 --> 44:42.839
where Julie talks about all the dumb
stuff you did when you were drunk.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.221
Like on your honeymoon in Paris,
when you pooped yourself.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.705
I had heat stroke!

44:46.720 --> 44:49.664
But it was mostly just how you get
emotional all the time and say I love you.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.867
Usually to Neil and I.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.711
So someone started a drinking game.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.399
- How's it work?
- It's very simple. They go into a pub.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.548
If you're in the pub, you're
drinking, and you say,

44:58.560 --> 45:00.469
"I love you," then they drink.

45:04.800 --> 45:08.347
- Leo, no. Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no!

45:08.400 --> 45:10.150
No, no, no, no, no! No.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.346
You're assholes! You know that?

- Is he a polar bear?
- No. A ghost bear.

49:22.720 --> 49:25.107
A black bear with a
rare recessive gene.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.302
They survived only because
the Kitasoo Indians

listening to your suggestions.

it at the time. That's okay.

faith in you back.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.866

right, it's my worst flaw.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.466

I mean I think I spent so long thinking
there was something wrong with me

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.471
because I was never
on the inside...

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.302

- Okay, I am the one wronged here!
- Yes. You were.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.183
- So I took a stand against this asshole.
- A stand?

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.311
Danny, taking a stand has to hurt.
Or make you look like a fool or...

No, not about him.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.111
I'm not gonna run into his

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.747
Yeah. Amazon ordered way more
than we had. Julie was right.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.749
Her just mentioning
it made it sell.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.749
We're going into a second printing!

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.740
The third impossible thing being

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:03.631
the death of the Big Horn Honker.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:12.386
Writing and the pursuit of a woman

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.741
are never about immediate results.

are about is telling the truth.

she'll hear you.

<font color="#804040">LEO</font>: I'd like to think I've evolved.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.305
But I'll always say,

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.629
some snap judgments are true.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.829
Because you have to be a
dick to drive a Hummer.

<font color="#804040">LEO</font>: Hey.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:28.710
- You're really out of breath.
- Just getting some exercise.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.065
What are you doing here?

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.868
There was a white bear spotted
on a trail north of town.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.103
And I wondered if

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.502
you wanted to look for him with me.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.267
I know a trail that
should get us there

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.070
without too bad a climb.

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.903
I know it's inappropriate...

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.620
but I want you, Leo Palamino.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.264
Right here.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:43.546
- Come on! Stay with me.
- <font color="#804040">BOY</font>: Nice view.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.910
Oh.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:54.068
The beauty of nature
will surprise you

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.911
if you look and listen.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.022

This way!
