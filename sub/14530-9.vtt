00:01.601 --> 00:02.634
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:02.636 --> 00:04.169
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:06.638
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:09.475
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:11.477
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:11.479 --> 00:13.712
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:15.482 --> 00:18.417
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:18.419 --> 00:20.786
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:23.422
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:23.424 --> 00:26.225
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:26.227 --> 00:29.128
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:29.130 --> 00:32.164
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.234
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:36.736 --> 00:38.737
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:38.739 --> 00:41.140
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:42.741
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:42.743 --> 00:45.411
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:57.824 --> 01:00.325
Krumitz: We got another one.
Nelson:
That's four and counting.

01:00.327 --> 01:01.593
What the hell
is going on up there?

01:01.595 --> 01:06.231
Faa has confirmed wi-fi is down
on four domestic flights,

01:06.233 --> 01:07.733
All monument air.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.834
Do they know why
this is happening?

01:08.836 --> 01:11.770
All right, I just spoke
to liftoff wireless.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.439
They've been trying to restore
in-flight internet access

01:13.441 --> 01:14.773
On the planes,
but something is blocking them.

01:14.775 --> 01:15.707
I'm here. Go.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.742
Uh, we got a fifth.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.843
No, no, make it six.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.745
Same as the others.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.314
All monument air. Looks like
some type of coordinated attack.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.382
Ryan:
Dhs is operating

01:23.384 --> 01:24.750
At national threat level yellow.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.285
It hasn't jumped to orange yet.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.853
Shouldn't we call
the president or someone?

01:27.855 --> 01:29.188
I mean, we're talking planes.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.322
Sifter:
Yeah, which is exactly why

01:30.324 --> 01:31.623
We don't jump to conclusions.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.593
Before we suggest they start
upping the threat level.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.095
No reports
of instrument malfunction.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.463
Pilots are still able
to communicate

01:37.465 --> 01:39.164
With the control tower.
Undercover air marshals

01:39.166 --> 01:41.400
Haven't detected any unusual
activity either.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.135
What time did the wi-fi
go down on those flights?

01:43.137 --> 01:44.436
Ten minutes after takeoff.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.305
All right, that means
they were above 10,000 feet.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.507
That's when the passengers
on monument air can connect

01:48.509 --> 01:50.576
Their electronic devices to
the in-flight wireless network.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.643
Got another one.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.811
Seven.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.813
Mundo:
Eight.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.248
Nine.
Sifter:
What the hell is this?

01:56.250 --> 01:58.750
Okay, okay.
What is it, krumitz?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.452
Liftoff wireless' server logs

02:00.454 --> 02:01.887
Show only one phone
on each plane

02:01.889 --> 02:03.856
Connected to the router and
caused wi-fi to go down.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.224
Ryan:
That means nine passengers

02:05.226 --> 02:07.159
On nine flights
shut off the wi-fi

02:07.161 --> 02:08.527
From within the plane?

02:08.529 --> 02:10.162
Sounds like
a coordinated attack to me.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.797
Think all nine passengers
are working together?

02:11.799 --> 02:14.867
Nelson, pull up
the flight routes.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.736
The destination cities
are all different,

02:17.738 --> 02:18.871
But they all originated

02:18.873 --> 02:21.273
From miami international.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.875
I'm calling homeland security.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.376
Secretary mcknight,
this is simon sifter,

02:24.378 --> 02:25.844
Cyber crime division.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.779
We've got a potential
national security threat.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.549
I'm requesting
that you immediately ground

02:30.551 --> 02:32.451
All monument air flights.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.852
Yes, I am sure.
As you know,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.754
Shutting down
passenger communication

02:35.756 --> 02:37.890
Is a possible precursor
to hijacking.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.892
I would like
all these flights redirected

02:39.894 --> 02:41.760
To their nearest airports.

02:41.762 --> 02:42.928
Monument air flight 417

02:42.930 --> 02:45.297
Is 300 miles outside of miami.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.633
That's the closest
and easiest to send back.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.635
All right, I'll have that flight
routed back to miami.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.171
Krumitz, can you tell
specifically which phone

02:52.173 --> 02:54.540
Or passenger shut down
the wi-fi?
I...

02:54.542 --> 02:55.874
I mean, it's gonna
take some time,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.242
But yeah.
Ryan:
Okay.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.544
We need the names
and the seat numbers

02:58.546 --> 03:00.546
For those passengers
with the phones,

03:00.548 --> 03:01.847
And we need them now.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.814
Let's go, elijah.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.883
Nelson.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.924
â™ª

03:14.627 --> 03:16.862
Okay, all right,
all right, got it.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.463
All right, thanks, krummy.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.933
Okay, target's sitting
in 14c.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.935
Plane is taxiing
to the gate right now.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.369
Good, what about
the other flights?

03:24.371 --> 03:25.737
Great.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.539
Local feds are detaining
the eight suspects

03:27.541 --> 03:29.875
In the other cities now.

03:36.482 --> 03:37.749
I-I just left for vacation.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.685
Someone needs to tell me
what this is about.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.755
Can you please call my husband?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.724
This is crazy.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.351
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.288
Take your headphones
out, please.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.757
How old are you?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.425
16.
Have you been sitting there

04:20.427 --> 04:22.694
The whole flight?
Yeah. Why?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.596
Cuff her.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.665
What did I do?
What's going on?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.967
Stand up, place your hands
behind your back, please.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.043
Willa?

04:40.513 --> 04:41.613
Dad!

04:41.615 --> 04:42.848
They won't let me leave.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.017
What's going on here?

04:45.885 --> 04:47.052
My daughter was going to visit

04:47.054 --> 04:48.587
Family in san diego.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.722
I don't get it.
Are you saying she's a suspect?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.025
We're just trying to understand
what happened here, mr. Hart.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.927
Someone hacked
into the plane's router.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.962
We traced that intrusion

04:56.964 --> 04:58.330
Back to willa's phone.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.598
What?

04:59.600 --> 05:02.701
Her cell phone serial number was
the last one

05:02.703 --> 05:05.971
That logged on to the onboard
router before it crashed.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.041
We ran that number through
every cell carrier's database

05:09.043 --> 05:10.075
Till it spit out a name.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.878
We matched that name
to the flight manifest.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.979
It gave us a seat number.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.547
Willa,

05:15.549 --> 05:17.049
Did you leave
your phone anywhere?

05:17.051 --> 05:18.950
Did you bump your device
with anyone?

05:18.952 --> 05:21.420
Did you text
or download anything?

05:22.722 --> 05:24.456
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Just answer

05:24.458 --> 05:25.757
Her questions.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.892
I texted some friends,

05:26.894 --> 05:30.762
I was just listening to music
and playing dots.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.097
Hmm.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.033
What's he doing?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.402
Imaging your phone,
making a duplicate copy

05:37.404 --> 05:40.072
Of your device to determine
what killed the wi-fi.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.473
Can I have it back?

05:42.942 --> 05:44.843
Once we're done with it.
Right now I want you to tell me

05:44.845 --> 05:48.046
Everything that happened
before your flight took off.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.350
My dad dropped me
at the curb.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.684
I checked my bag,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.619
Went through security,

05:54.621 --> 05:56.521
Had a smoothie.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.657
I bought it at mango mel's.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.426
And then I waited at the gate
for my flight.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.662
Does the name audrey monroe

06:03.664 --> 06:06.832
Mean anything to you?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.100
How about ken galvin?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.036
Margaret sloane?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.871
What do they have to do
with willa?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.073
Your daughter's phone's not the
only one that cut off the wi-fi.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.575
It happened
on eight other flights.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.743
Lee yang?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.444
Jason hawking?

06:19.446 --> 06:20.746
I don't know
any of these people.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.950
That my daughter didn't have
anything to do with this.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.618
She's just a kid.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.120
Mr. Hart, in my line of work,

06:28.122 --> 06:30.889
"just a kid"
doesn't mean anything.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.061
Hey, yo, e.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.829
It's getting ugly
over there, man.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.765
Yeah, well,
their flight's been grounded

06:39.767 --> 06:41.099
And they haven't been given
an explanation.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.434
You'd be angry, too.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.536
Well, you're right.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.072
So, I ran diagnostics
on the plane's router.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.674
One device overloaded
the entire system.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.576
It was
a denial-of-service attack.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.178
Pilot:
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:53.180 --> 06:56.615
At this time,
liftoff wireless' wi-fi service

06:56.617 --> 06:58.850
Is available
at a charge of $9.99

06:58.852 --> 07:00.185
For the duration of the flight.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.154
Thank you.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.189
Nelson:
<i>Willa's phone prevented</i>
<i>any other passenger's device</i>

07:04.191 --> 07:05.590
<i>From connecting to the wi-fi.</i>

07:09.862 --> 07:12.097
Phones aren't supposed to send
that many data packets at once.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.165
Yeah, unless a hacker

07:13.167 --> 07:14.733
With some skills worked
their magic.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.102
I'll go ahead and unplug
the router from the plane.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.203
I'll send it back to ctoc.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.172
Do that.
All right.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.107
Anything from
our fbi field teams?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.542
Sifter:
Well, they've interrogated

07:23.544 --> 07:24.976
The other eight suspects.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.578
They're all
from different cities.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.113
They span multiple generations,

07:28.115 --> 07:30.882
And they've all got
varying levels of technology,

07:30.884 --> 07:33.752
And they all allege
they have no idea what happened.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.187
Willa hart said the same thing.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.855
She has no clue
what's going on.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.923
Field teams confiscated

07:37.925 --> 07:39.224
Our suspects' phones.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.192
They're imaging them now.

07:40.194 --> 07:41.493
Data should be here any minute.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.695
So, avery, I've made
a lot of moves here.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.197
There are gonna be
a lot of questions.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.132
So, from your end,
what does this look like?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.934
I'm not sure yet,

07:48.936 --> 07:51.036
But I'm not willing
to give up on the idea

07:51.038 --> 07:52.070
That these people are connected.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.738
(register dings)

07:53.740 --> 07:55.207
I'm sorry, ma'am,
this one didn't work either.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.142
Two of my credit cards
have been declined?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.010
That's impossible.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.145
No, I didn't buy ten laptops.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.646
I don't even shop
at that store.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.616
(phones ringing,
overlapping chatter)

08:06.486 --> 08:07.552
Avery, what's happening?

08:07.554 --> 08:08.587
I'm not sure yet. Hold on.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.821
Let me flip view.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.256
(ringing, chattering)

08:11.258 --> 08:13.091
It suddenly just got
very noisy in here.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.626
Yeah, my credit card's
been denied.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.495
What do you mean you don't
know what's going on?

08:16.497 --> 08:17.863
It happened on your plane.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.168
Are you seeing this?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.203
Man:
All of my credit cards

08:25.205 --> 08:28.507
All of these people
were passengers

08:28.509 --> 08:30.976
On willa hart's flight.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.010
Simon,

08:32.012 --> 08:34.279
I know what this is.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.147
This is a credit card heist.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.650
Dozens of people
who got off that plane

08:38.652 --> 08:40.051
Are starting to receive alerts

08:40.053 --> 08:41.620
That their credit cards
have been frozen.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.021
Someone stole their information.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.257
That's it, that's it, that's it.

08:45.259 --> 08:48.827
Is the one place where people
are held captive.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.228
You can't connect

08:50.230 --> 08:53.798
To the rest of the world
if the wi-fi is down.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.067
The passengers wouldn't even
know that they'd been robbed

08:56.069 --> 08:58.203
Till they got off the plane
and connected to the internet.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.271
I don't believe this.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.573
What?
This can't be right.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.974
I've seen this before.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.910
There it is again and again.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.144
He uses
a unique signature

09:06.146 --> 09:07.579
When writing code.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.580
He?

09:08.582 --> 09:09.648
What is it, krumitz?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.283
I know who did it.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.752
Lomis.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.086
Lomis is behind this,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.155
And it's just the beginning.

09:21.661 --> 09:27.866
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

09:29.735 --> 09:35.307
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

09:35.309 --> 09:39.678
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

09:39.680 --> 09:43.014
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

09:43.016 --> 09:47.586
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

09:47.588 --> 09:51.056
â™ª and miles...

09:51.058 --> 09:53.625
â™ª oh, yeah.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.839
I can't believe
this is lomis.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.808
He's like a hacker legend.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.210
Came out of nowhere
a few years back.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.113
Now, they say he's in his 30s,
good-looking,

10:15.115 --> 10:16.314
Comes from estonia.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.283
Sounds like
a little hacker envy, nelson.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.284
No. (chuckles)

10:19.286 --> 10:20.685
Look, it's admiration.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.020
Lomis lives up to his name.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.788
It's leetspeak
for "low missile."

10:23.790 --> 10:24.889
Flies under the radar.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.057
He's only surfaced twice.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.994
Both times at defcon in vegas.

10:28.996 --> 10:32.330
All right, over $400,000
have been stolen

10:32.332 --> 10:34.199
In our credit card scam
and over 300 people

10:34.201 --> 10:35.767
Have reported theft.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.901
There's no telling

10:36.903 --> 10:39.371
When this is gonna end.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.406
(nelson whoops)

10:41.408 --> 10:42.841
Nelson:
See?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.944
Now that's what I call
traveling in style.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.780
Ryan: Sifter has connections
with the coast guard,

10:48.782 --> 10:51.883
So krumitz gets a free escort
from d.C. To miami.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.399
Nelson:
Nice ride, bro!

11:07.401 --> 11:09.334
It's the only
way to fly!

11:11.303 --> 11:14.072
Krumitz, you're sure
this is lomis?

11:14.074 --> 11:16.307
Every bone in my body
says I'm right.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.909
This is how
he works.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.811
When the wi-fi intrusion
on the planes

11:19.813 --> 11:21.980
Connected to the credit cards,
I knew it was him.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.281
Sounds like a hunch.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.949
And your obsession
with catching a guy

11:24.951 --> 11:26.284
You've been chasing
for the last three years.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.120
But it's not.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.955
Before I left ctoc,

11:30.957 --> 11:32.090
I found a connection

11:32.092 --> 11:34.392
Between the nine suspects
and lomis.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.061
I discovered a malicious script

11:36.063 --> 11:38.263
Buried deep in
the nine suspects' phones.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.098
The code exploited
a vulnerability

11:40.100 --> 11:41.266
In the operating system.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.135
(beeping)

11:44.137 --> 11:45.770
Nelson:
Yeah, that's his signature.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.173
A custom code that gains
complete control over the os

11:48.175 --> 11:50.975
And suffocates the security
features like a boa constrictor.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.210
Means he can do
whatever he wants

11:52.212 --> 11:53.845
With any of the phones...

11:55.314 --> 11:56.881
<i>...Steal your identity,</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:57.982
<i>Access personal info,</i>

11:57.984 --> 11:59.350
<i>Even attach malware.</i>

11:59.352 --> 12:00.919
It doesn't make
sense, though.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.120
I mean, in the past,

12:02.122 --> 12:03.421
Lomis robbed a new
york hedge fund,

12:03.423 --> 12:04.489
The payroll

12:04.491 --> 12:06.024
At san francisco pd,

12:06.026 --> 12:07.392
Even went after
an nhl team.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.260
Now this?
Ryan:
You're right. Credit cards

12:09.262 --> 12:12.964
And planes doesn't really fit
his behavioral profile.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.099
It's not what he does.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.366
It's how he does it.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.936
He starts with creating chaos

12:17.938 --> 12:19.270
And it grows
into something bigger.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.005
That's what this is.
Mundo:
If lomis is the one behind

12:21.007 --> 12:22.741
This credit
card heist,

12:22.743 --> 12:24.008
It means that none of our
nine suspects even knew

12:24.010 --> 12:27.879
Means willa hart and the rest
of the eight passengers

12:27.881 --> 12:28.947
Are all victims.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.181
Call the fbi field teams,

12:30.183 --> 12:31.449
Have everyone we've
been holding released.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.450
Nelson...
Yes?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.785
Follow the credit card trail.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.086
Look for any purchases
that stand out.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.087
Okay.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.089
Krumitz, check for the code

12:38.091 --> 12:40.391
Lomis placed on the rest of
the victims' cell phones.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.160
We're about to catch
a white whale.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.529
No, that's done.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.331
We alerted
the credit card companies

12:46.333 --> 12:48.366
And it should be
a day or two, and ...

12:48.368 --> 12:49.834
Yeah-- hey, mike.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.836
Gotta call you back.
Thanks.

12:51.838 --> 12:55.073
Colin, I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you

12:55.075 --> 12:56.374
On your
promotion yet.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.076
Deputy director.
That's-that's big.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.878
Thank you, simon, but I'm not
here to talk about that.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.514
The director just
called me to ask

13:02.516 --> 13:05.316
Why you grounded all monument
air flights out of miami.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.885
I managed to support
your decision,

13:06.887 --> 13:09.154
Despite the fact that I
knew nothing about it.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.388
You should have
brought me up to speed.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.323
There was no time
to bring you up to speed.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.926
Cyber crime
moves fast here, colin.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.128
Regardless, you should have
consulted me first.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.132
Look, I-I've always
had the authority

13:21.134 --> 13:22.834
To kind of run my own division.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.170
Wait, are you... You telling me
the rules have changed?

13:25.172 --> 13:28.039
I'm telling you
I should have been told.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.240
I don't want to lose sleep

13:29.242 --> 13:30.408
Worrying if you're gonna
keep me up to speed

13:30.410 --> 13:31.876
On everything I need to know.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.078
I grounded those planes
to save lives

13:34.080 --> 13:38.183
And prevent a possible
national security threat, okay?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.485
I had to make a tough,
split-second decision.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.021
You cost an airline
millions of dollars.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.422
W-what... What is this?

13:44.424 --> 13:46.858
Are you... Are you scolding me?

13:46.860 --> 13:49.928
From now on,
you keep me in the loop.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.930
You report to me.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.998
I report to the director.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.604
Understood.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.605
(door closes)

14:00.607 --> 14:02.941
â™ª

14:02.943 --> 14:04.943
Yes!

14:04.945 --> 14:06.878
Ryan:
What is it?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.581
I've been thinking
about this all wrong.

14:09.583 --> 14:10.949
That doesn't
sound great.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.251
Because I realized
that the code itself

14:13.253 --> 14:16.988
I'm still waiting
on the "great" here, bud.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.257
<i>How</i> the code got onto
the phones is the key.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.558
That's a
pairing record.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.894
Yep.
A history of the last device

14:22.896 --> 14:26.431
All these phones paired
with the exact same device.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.434
And all the time stamps
are within an hour

14:29.436 --> 14:31.069
Before our victims'
flights took off.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.470
That means they picked up
lomis' malicious script

14:32.472 --> 14:33.905
Somewhere in
this terminal.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.273
Nelson:
There's at least
50 different ways

14:35.275 --> 14:36.341
To infect a phone.

14:41.513 --> 14:43.181
Lomis is clever.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.216
He picked a place where he could
install his malicious script

14:45.218 --> 14:47.619
On multiple victims' phones,
all at the same time.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.454
We're looking for
a watering hole.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.588
Maximize the
number of victims,

14:50.590 --> 14:52.023
Maximize the
credit card info.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.227
Mundo:
Right there.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.228
They plugged their phone
in to get a charge,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.364
Ryan:
No, that charging station

14:59.366 --> 15:00.365
Is off the beaten path.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.633
Infrequent traffic.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.301
He would have chosen
a high-traffic station

15:03.303 --> 15:05.270
For his victims.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.210
Mundo:
That's our crime scene.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.449
Ryan:
When someone plugs in
their phone to charge,

15:18.451 --> 15:20.118
Their info is being stolen.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.024
This was juice jacking.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.091
All right.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.294
I'll call the airline,

15:29.296 --> 15:30.428
Get the passenger manifest
for every flight

15:30.430 --> 15:31.529
That left the terminal
this morning.

15:31.531 --> 15:35.600
Krumitz, I need you
to clear all the passengers

15:35.602 --> 15:38.536
Nelson, start removing
all the malicious

15:38.538 --> 15:40.305
Script from everyone's phone.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.973
We need to shut this down now.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.510
Fbi!

15:45.512 --> 15:46.678
Everyone unplug.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.379
Man:
What? Hey.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.014
Woman:
My phone is dead.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.617
Hey, don't unplug my phone.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.685
It's dead.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.287
Tell me something, sir.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.523
Have you ever heard
of juice jacking?

15:58.525 --> 15:59.991
No, and I don't care to.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.428
You see
this cord?

16:03.430 --> 16:04.595
It charges your phone, right?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.997
Nice. Safe.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.365
You think it's your friend.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.434
But you see this connector
on the end?

16:09.436 --> 16:11.135
Yeah. It's a usb plug.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.071
Not exactly groundbreaking
stuff, guy.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.372
Hmm.

16:14.374 --> 16:19.010
Most people don't realize
that this cord has four ports.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.145
Two for power,
which charge your phone,

16:21.147 --> 16:24.382
And two for data,
which transfer--

16:24.384 --> 16:25.450
Yes,

16:25.452 --> 16:27.251
You guessed it-- your data.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.687
Now, what do
you think your phone

16:29.689 --> 16:31.489
Was doing just now, guy?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.690
Charging.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.425
Krumitz:
<i>Wrong.</i>

16:34.427 --> 16:35.460
<i>Stealing your data.</i>

16:35.462 --> 16:37.095
<i>You just wanted a charge,</i>

16:37.097 --> 16:38.363
<i>And you had no idea</i>

16:38.365 --> 16:40.231
<i>That a hacker had installed</i>

16:40.233 --> 16:41.399
A juice-jacking
device

16:41.401 --> 16:42.667
That allows him to steal
your credit cards,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.169
Your photos, your videos,

16:45.171 --> 16:46.604
Everything on your phone.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.340
Now, if you just go get in line

16:49.342 --> 16:50.408
And talk to that

16:50.410 --> 16:51.776
Short gentleman
trying to pull off

16:51.778 --> 16:53.077
The purple paisley tie,

16:53.079 --> 16:54.612
He's gonna take
the malicious script

16:54.614 --> 16:55.646
Off your phone for you.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.714
Problem solved.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.753
Thank you.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.063
Got it.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.464
Patient zero.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.333
Mm!

17:15.335 --> 17:17.635
I need the north side of
the terminal cleared out.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.237
No one goes
in or out.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.272
This is a crime
scene now.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.373
Excuse me, ma'am? Sir?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.674
I need you to clear the area.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.044
Pardon me, miss.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.111
Ma'am?

17:40.626 --> 17:41.726
(crowd talking excitedly)

17:45.130 --> 17:46.397
Mundo:
The vic's name was
rachel carrington,

17:46.399 --> 17:48.332
A grad student
at the university of miami.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.702
To put herself through school.
What did she do here?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.638
She was a credit card sales rep
for monument air.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.173
She worked at the
charging station,

17:55.175 --> 17:56.240
Trying to get
people to sign up

17:56.242 --> 17:58.109
For their new
peak miles card.

17:58.111 --> 17:58.843
Local feds just contacted
her family in phoenix.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.144
They're flying in now.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.080
Did the coroner
determine the cod?

18:02.082 --> 18:04.849
Preliminary report
is blunt force trauma.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.818
They found traces of blood
in the women's restroom.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.319
They haven't ruled it
a homicide yet,

18:08.321 --> 18:11.189
But there are signs
of a struggle.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.524
Honestly...

18:13.526 --> 18:15.226
It's not
adding up for me.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.327
Hackers aren't murderers.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.328
Neither are robbers,

18:17.330 --> 18:18.529
Until something goes wrong

18:18.531 --> 18:19.864
And they become
desperate.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.332
We need to gain access

18:21.334 --> 18:22.767
To the security footage
in the airport.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.335
I'm on it.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.336
Guys!

18:25.338 --> 18:26.704
Guys, wait!
Wait.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.372
Remember when krumitz said

18:28.374 --> 18:30.241
That lomis likes
to start off with chaos

18:30.243 --> 18:31.375
And then it grows
into something bigger?

18:31.377 --> 18:32.577
Yeah?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.512
Well, it just happened.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.715
I was removing the malicious
script from the phone

18:37.717 --> 18:40.718
And suddenly I got locked out.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.886
Look at this.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.254
Ryan:
"hi, chelsea.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.322
"you're phone's been hijacked.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.224
"what would
your fiancÃ© joey think

18:46.226 --> 18:47.892
"if he saw you being
a dirty slut?

18:47.894 --> 18:50.528
"reply with a 14-digit
prepaid cash voucher

18:50.530 --> 18:53.397
"for $250 in the next 24 hours,

18:53.399 --> 18:54.499
This goes away."

18:54.501 --> 18:56.234
This is ransomware.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.736
The malicious script
is a custom code

18:58.738 --> 19:02.173
And allows lomis complete
control over all the phones.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.708
Lomis just stepped up his game.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.676
Now he's holding
the phones hostage.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.912
We stopped his payday;
now he's retaliating.

19:07.914 --> 19:08.913
Nelson, I need you

19:08.915 --> 19:11.149
To get back to d.C.
Stay on top of

19:11.151 --> 19:12.283
The stolen credit cards

19:12.285 --> 19:13.918
And crack that ransomware.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.887
Done. Um...

19:15.889 --> 19:17.822
Is there gonna be
peanuts and pretzels

19:17.824 --> 19:18.923
On the coast guard chopper?

19:18.925 --> 19:21.225
(laughs)

19:25.230 --> 19:27.198
Is this some kind of sick joke?
No.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.167
It's completely frozen.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.168
Someone put ransomware on it.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.536
You mean

19:31.538 --> 19:34.939
<i>By charging my phone,</i>
<i>all this happened?</i>

19:34.941 --> 19:36.908
Ryan:
<i>Yes.</i>

19:36.910 --> 19:39.277
<i>A hacker took control of</i>
<i>your phone and locked you out</i>

19:39.279 --> 19:41.212
<i>Until you pay the amount</i>
<i>that he's demanding.</i>

19:41.214 --> 19:42.313
He has personal information.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.615
He knows my fiancÃ©'s name.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.417
Not only did he lock you out,

19:46.419 --> 19:48.286
He accessed your personal data--

19:48.288 --> 19:51.389
Your messages,
phone calls, pictures.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.557
What is he going to do with it?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.824
Well, he's threatening
to release it

19:53.826 --> 19:55.259
If you don't pay.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.229
What did he find on that phone

19:58.231 --> 20:00.198
You don't want
your fiancÃ© to see?

20:04.403 --> 20:05.670
Am I really expected to pay

20:05.672 --> 20:08.406
$250,000 to
unlock my phone?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.675
Senator, we don't suggest
you pay this ransom.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.809
And when I don't?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.678
Any number of
things can happen.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.213
Could you try to be
a little more specific?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.949
All right. As that text
you received threatens,

20:17.951 --> 20:19.684
He will post all of
your personal information

20:19.686 --> 20:20.851
On the internet.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.253
Senator:
I just flew back

20:22.255 --> 20:23.588
From a family trip to miami

20:23.590 --> 20:24.889
And simply charged my phone,

20:24.891 --> 20:26.490
And now this happens?

20:26.492 --> 20:27.692
What action are you taking?

20:27.694 --> 20:28.993
We're working
some promising leads.

20:28.995 --> 20:29.994
We've...
(scoffs)

20:29.996 --> 20:32.263
Really, gentlemen?

20:32.265 --> 20:33.331
Really?

20:33.333 --> 20:36.434
A lot of money to
the cyber division,

20:36.436 --> 20:38.236
And "promising leads"?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.237
Is that the best you can do?

20:39.239 --> 20:40.404
These things take time.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.007
Time is not something I have.

20:43.009 --> 20:46.477
The highly sensitive
government material

20:46.479 --> 20:47.945
On this phone goes public.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.382
Senator, look,
all due respect...

20:51.384 --> 20:54.385
I mean, you know better
than to keep

20:54.387 --> 20:58.456
Sensitive government documents
on a personal phone, so...

20:58.458 --> 21:00.291
What exactly
are you worried about?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.792
Senator:
I have telephone numbers

21:01.794 --> 21:04.362
And information of high-profile

21:04.364 --> 21:07.331
Colleagues
and friends.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.034
I have photos of my husband
and my children on this phone.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.303
Clearly, there's something else
on that phone

21:12.305 --> 21:13.537
You don't want getting out.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.639
You don't understand.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.674
It can't get out.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.410
What I have on this phone
is very personal.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.012
It could ruin my career.

21:21.014 --> 21:24.849
Senator, he's already got
what's on your phone.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.286
What, I cross my fingers
and hope for the best?

21:28.288 --> 21:29.754
We are doing everything we can

21:29.756 --> 21:32.490
To identify
and arrest the target.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.425
You just don't get it.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.395
People I care about
will be hurt.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.807
I found something--
take a look at this.

21:51.343 --> 21:54.345
Rachel carrington helps this
sick woman to the bathroom.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.347
And that's when
our juice jackers swoop in.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.849
The sick woman was a
distraction to get rachel away

21:58.851 --> 22:00.751
From the charging bar.
Exactly.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.453
Our juice jackers
have about a minute

22:02.455 --> 22:06.457
To install their black box
before our sick lady returns.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.092
Miraculously,

22:08.094 --> 22:10.494
She doesn't look
so sick anymore.

22:12.764 --> 22:14.365
Wait, stop.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.533
Rewind that.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.103
Do you have a camera angle from
the direction they're heading?

22:19.105 --> 22:21.439
No, there's
a blind spot

22:21.441 --> 22:23.374
Between gates 213
and 214.

22:23.376 --> 22:24.975
That's where the
bathrooms are, isn't it?

22:24.977 --> 22:28.012
And where the airport police
reported finding blood.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.949
So these three people
were working together.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.018
The sick woman killed
rachel carrington.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.488
Yeah, but the problem is--
how do we identify them?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.790
This footage,
it's way too grainy.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.991
That's a dead end.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.660
Well, maybe not.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.128
The black box
that they installed

22:44.130 --> 22:46.397
Had to get
through security, right?

22:52.804 --> 22:54.572
Take a snapshot of that duffel.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.380
Ryan: To get that juice-jacking
device in the terminal,

23:02.382 --> 23:04.048
Somebody had to get it
through security.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.417
Most people don't know
that tsa keeps

23:06.419 --> 23:07.952
All x ray photos
for a week.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.954
We can run our
duffel's snapshot

23:09.956 --> 23:13.491
And based on the size, shape
and material of the device,

23:13.493 --> 23:15.593
We should be able to figure out
when this came through.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.395
Ryan: Check all the bags
that went through security

23:17.397 --> 23:20.631
Two hours before the jackers
were spotted on surveillance.

23:24.603 --> 23:25.936
Krumitz:
Okay, we got it.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.605
Mundo:
All right, hold on.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.408
Even if we can get a visual
on who came in with it,

23:30.410 --> 23:32.176
Chances are pretty good
they used a fake I.D.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.512
Ryan: Well, that doesn't mean
we can't find them.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.514
You can learn a lot
about somebody

23:36.516 --> 23:38.516
By examining the contents
of their bag.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.518
Krumitz, remove everything
that's blue.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.421
It's metal like
our juice-jacking device.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.424
Now, separate the
materials by colors.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.427
We're looking for anything
plastic or biological.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.662
Take away the biomaterials
in orange.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.931
Focus on the
plastics in green.

23:57.636 --> 23:58.669
Right there.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.571
Do you see
that wizard hat?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.106
That's the warlocks.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.474
Mundo:
The hacker collective.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.043
Yeah, their symbol's
a wizard hat.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.847
It's like an all-access pass for
proving their gang affiliation.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.116
That's lomis' crew,
our juice jackers.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.752
Krumitz, search all bags before
and after this image

24:14.754 --> 24:16.153
For the same shape.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.590
There. There's
two more badges.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.058
Krumitz: That proves
that the two juice jackers

24:21.060 --> 24:22.760
And the sick woman
are all involved.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.762
All right, that's great,
but how do we find them?

24:24.764 --> 24:27.131
Hacker collectives hide
themselves all around the world.
(phone rings)

24:27.133 --> 24:29.133
I mean, they could be anywhere.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.068
My boy nelson
coming through.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.537
He just came up with a traceable
hit on the credit cards.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.506
All right, looks like most
of the purchases were made

24:35.508 --> 24:38.509
Like high-end department stores
and electronic retailers.

24:38.511 --> 24:42.613
You got computers,
laptops, handbags.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.615
Goods that can easily
be sold for quick cash.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.618
Yeah, except that nelson just
found an odd online purchase.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.752
Ryan: No, that's
a server blade.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.521
That is not something
you can buy

24:50.523 --> 24:51.822
At your local
electronics store.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.191
But I'm willing
to bet that's something

24:54.193 --> 24:56.627
A hacker collective
is gonna want.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.195
Mundo: Big online purchase
with a stolen credit card?

24:58.197 --> 25:02.233
That's a little sloppy
for lomis, don't you think?

25:02.235 --> 25:03.868
No, but we stopped
his payday.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.903
He's scrambling, I mean,
that's when you make mistakes.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.838
His mistake is our gain.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.841
The clock is ticking--
we've got 14 hours left.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.711
That purchase is gonna be linked
to an address-- find it.

25:18.550 --> 25:20.117
Fbi!

25:21.052 --> 25:22.286
Fbi!

25:22.288 --> 25:23.554
Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

25:23.556 --> 25:24.555
(indistinct shouting)

25:24.557 --> 25:25.923
On the ground now!

25:25.925 --> 25:28.125
Get down! On the ground now!

25:28.127 --> 25:30.094
Get on the floor!

25:30.096 --> 25:31.562
Heads down!

25:31.564 --> 25:32.796
(indistinct shouting)

25:33.565 --> 25:35.566
He went out the back door.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.606
Fbi, freeze!

25:46.545 --> 25:47.578
Crap!

25:55.587 --> 25:57.922
(both grunting)

26:12.704 --> 26:14.238
I really thought
lomis would be here.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.884
We found traces of blood
underneath your fingernail.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.054
Dna matched
rachel carrington.

26:32.691 --> 26:33.691
You killed her.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.692
No.

26:34.694 --> 26:37.061
No, it was
an accident.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.729
<i>I was just supposed</i>
<i>to distract her.</i>

26:38.731 --> 26:40.798
Carrington:
<i>Glad you're feeling better.</i>

26:40.800 --> 26:42.666
I really have to be
heading back, though.

26:42.668 --> 26:43.701
Uh, wait.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.669
Wh...
What are you...?

26:46.705 --> 26:48.372
Mundo:
Once you realized she was dead,

26:48.374 --> 26:50.808
You went back to your partners.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.943
She was still breathing
when we left her.

26:57.716 --> 27:00.718
<i>I thought for sure someone</i>
<i>would find her immediately.</i>

27:00.720 --> 27:02.653
You made it look
like she was sleeping

27:02.655 --> 27:05.856
So you could buy enough time
to escape the crime scene.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.758
No, I wanted to tell someone.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.126
First man:
But they wouldn't let me.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.662
They were scared of
what he would do to us.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.130
Of what who
would do to you?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.132
Lomis? You said
you'd never met him?

27:15.134 --> 27:16.800
Second man:
Online, man.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.137
Where reputations matter.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.139
He could destroy us.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.808
He could ruin
our cred.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.143
You know
what I can do?

27:26.145 --> 27:29.079
Put you in jail
for the next 25 years.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.081
Who's collecting
the phone-ransom money?

27:31.083 --> 27:33.817
I didn't know about the phones
being ransomed, I swear.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.653
He hired us

27:35.655 --> 27:37.821
<i>To install the box</i>
<i>and clone the cards</i>

27:37.823 --> 27:40.324
Oh, come on,
there was a server blade.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.759
What do you think
that was for?

27:41.761 --> 27:43.694
That server blade?

27:43.696 --> 27:44.795
We didn't buy it.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.796
Lomis did.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.131
He sent it to us.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.666
He set us up to take the fall.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.167
You expect me to believe that?

27:50.169 --> 27:52.703
He didn't even show up...

27:52.705 --> 27:53.771
To collect his share
of the take.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.973
Who passes up
on that much money?

28:04.015 --> 28:05.883
I don't believe them.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.718
They know where lomis is,
they have to.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.886
No, they don't,
krumitz.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.287
They've never met him.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.356
Which is why your white
whale never gets caught.

28:18.263 --> 28:20.330
(laughs)

28:35.947 --> 28:36.980
What is that?

28:36.982 --> 28:38.749
Lomis is taunting me.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.217
He knew I'd find the
juice-jacking device,

28:40.219 --> 28:43.387
And he overrode the data with
"gotcha!" a bajillion times.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.890
There's no way to retrieve
what was there before.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.858
Hence "gotcha!"

28:47.860 --> 28:49.893
Those the shredded phones?

28:49.895 --> 28:51.829
Get on the floor!

28:51.831 --> 28:53.731
Krumitz:
<i>Yep.</i>

28:53.733 --> 28:55.966
I figured they tried
to destroy 'em because
there's something on them

28:55.968 --> 28:57.735
They don't want me to find.

28:57.737 --> 29:01.171
I'm recovering all of
the salvageable pieces.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.445
Anything?

29:08.447 --> 29:10.347
No. Not yet.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.350
Okay. I got your time stamp.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.852
Come on.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.987
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.388
Yes!

29:18.390 --> 29:20.257
Did you just get
his serial number?
Yep.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.996
I got you now, lomis.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.464
I'm gonna track
this serial number

29:27.466 --> 29:29.466
Right down
to your evil lair.

29:29.468 --> 29:33.370
(trilling, beeping)

29:36.241 --> 29:41.979
You got to be kidding me.
It's untraceable.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.882
Damn it!

29:47.552 --> 29:50.187
When was the last time
you slept?

29:50.189 --> 29:53.357
Listen, man, I know
it's hard, all right?

29:53.359 --> 29:56.426
I do. Believe me. All right,
I ever tell you about the...

29:56.428 --> 29:59.897
The sleeper cell I
tracked in kandahar?

29:59.899 --> 30:03.233
117 degrees.

30:03.235 --> 30:06.904
It was the kind that-that chaps
the inside of your mouth.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.572
All right,
between the four of us,

30:08.574 --> 30:11.108
We had half a canteen
of water left.

30:11.110 --> 30:15.045
We had been there for three days
because I was obsessed.

30:15.047 --> 30:19.216
I knew if I stayed on 'em,
if I persevered,

30:19.218 --> 30:21.185
I'd find 'em.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.021
I was wrong.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.422
So you just quit?

30:25.424 --> 30:27.391
You gave up?

30:27.393 --> 30:28.926
No.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.994
There's a big difference
between quitting

30:30.996 --> 30:33.263
And just knowing
when it's not your day.

30:35.099 --> 30:36.466
We need you in ctoc.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.902
When you're ready.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.141
Did you catch them?

30:48.980 --> 30:50.447
What do you think?

30:50.449 --> 30:52.549
I had to wait
a month, but...

30:52.551 --> 30:55.185
Believe me, it was worth it.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.895
Sifter:
Okay, we only have two hours

31:04.897 --> 31:07.364
Before our victims' private
data is released on the web.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.533
How close are we
to... Anything?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.101
The code's sophisticated.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.636
We're getting there,
but it's gonna take time.

31:12.638 --> 31:16.206
Against orders, some people
paid the ransom already.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.908
Hey, guys, we got a problem.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.244
Lomis isn't waiting
for the deadline.

31:20.246 --> 31:23.647
He's releasing
people's information right now.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.916
And he started with
the most powerful person first.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.485
I thought
the senator already paid.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.254
Yeah, I thought
she did, too.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.956
Well, this will be the headline
on every national newscast.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.625
Got another one.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.294
Ryan:
Chelsea's photos were released

31:37.296 --> 31:38.662
To a revenge porn site.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.564
Lomis isn't
playing by the rules,

31:40.566 --> 31:42.432
Which makes him very dangerous.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.401
Krumitz:
Guys! Guys!

31:44.403 --> 31:46.270
I did it.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.138
I finally found lomis.
I got an I.D.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.573
How'd you find him?

31:49.575 --> 31:52.109
Just like you said--
go back to the evidence.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.977
So I took another look
at the juice-jacking box.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.680
Lomis made it impossible to
recover any data off that thing.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.081
You're right.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.250
Except for one thing: Time.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.220
I know what time lomis
overwrote the data.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.023
It was four hours before
we even found the box
at the airport.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.592
That's around the time
the first flights
were taking off.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.561
He had to plug directly
into the charging station

32:11.563 --> 32:12.963
To steal everyone's data.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.398
Lomis was there, in person.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.500
Yeah-- I pulled the
airport security footage

32:16.502 --> 32:18.936
Four hours before
we arrived.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.103
(computer beeping)

32:20.105 --> 32:22.005
Say hello to lomis.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.221
Okay, your point?

32:38.223 --> 32:39.456
I mean,
this doesn't prove anything.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.458
Yeah, well, it's about
to prove everything.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.260
I don't even know
what you're showing me.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.429
Krumitz:
Mr. Hart, we know the truth.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.498
Hart: I'm telling you,
you've got it wrong.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.200
Ryan:
We have evidence...
No!

32:51.302 --> 32:53.070
I mean, willa is
a straight-a student.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.005
She plays soccer,
dance lessons, violin...

32:55.007 --> 32:58.375
And she also took first place
in the miami-dade county

32:58.377 --> 32:59.743
High school chess
tournament.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.745
We get it--
she's a genius

33:01.747 --> 33:03.480
And you're a proud father.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.716
This is insane.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.485
All right, willa's
not a hacker.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.720
And she's a good kid.

33:09.722 --> 33:11.421
Maybe she is.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.990
But maybe she's not.

33:12.992 --> 33:15.258
I have a warrant
for her tablet.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.493
If it's clean,
she's innocent.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.763
And exactly the daughter
you believe her to be.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.431
Why would
she do this?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.166
(door opens)

33:24.268 --> 33:27.104
Dad, whose car is that
in the driveway?

33:27.106 --> 33:29.473
Krumitz: Belongs to the
federal bureau of investigation.

33:31.275 --> 33:33.210
Hello, lomis.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.445
It's nice to meet you.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.515
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.587
Gotcha.

33:47.492 --> 33:53.130
Everything about you
is unexpected.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.065
We bought your disguise.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.466
We actually
thought you <i>were</i>

33:56.468 --> 33:58.535
A 35-year-old man
from eastern europe.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.171
Very clever.
You went through
all the trouble

34:01.173 --> 34:02.472
Of stealing
credit card information

34:02.474 --> 34:04.041
And never collected your take.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.576
<i>You were the mastermind</i>
<i>behind the whole plan.</i>

34:06.578 --> 34:10.480
<i>Stole all those credit card</i>
<i>numbers but never met up</i>

34:10.482 --> 34:12.482
<i>With your accomplices</i>
<i>to get paid.</i>

34:12.484 --> 34:13.784
Ryan:
<i>But, then again, you couldn't.</i>

34:13.786 --> 34:15.585
A 16-year-old girl
couldn't show up

34:15.587 --> 34:18.221
At a hacker's house to collect.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.423
You would've blown
your cover.

34:19.425 --> 34:20.824
So then you ransomed
all the phones,

34:20.826 --> 34:22.526
And we thought you were
gonna get paid that way.

34:22.528 --> 34:25.796
But then you began releasing
the ransomed data anyway.

34:25.798 --> 34:28.765
Senator finnis
tried to pay you.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.400
But, to our surprise,
you denied payment.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.469
Because it wasn't
about the money.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.171
I have to know.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.539
What was this about? Why

34:35.541 --> 34:38.075
Did you do it?

34:38.077 --> 34:39.476
Did you even

34:39.478 --> 34:42.212
Think about
the consequences?

34:42.214 --> 34:44.548
Senator finnis,
michael young,

34:44.550 --> 34:46.249
Victoria fields,

34:46.251 --> 34:49.119
Simone taylor-- you ruined
their lives today.

34:51.556 --> 34:52.823
Look, this
isn't a joke,

34:52.825 --> 34:54.658
Willa. Tell us why.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.359
Why did you do it?

34:56.361 --> 34:58.628
Because I wanted to.

35:00.565 --> 35:03.467
I was bored.
I did it because I could.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.479
Vickner:
You saw this, right?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.247
Sifter:
Oh, yeah.

35:17.249 --> 35:20.484
The senator's husband
and children learning her

35:20.486 --> 35:23.320
Sexual preference from the
front page of a paper, it's...

35:23.322 --> 35:25.555
Yeah, well,
privacy is a myth.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.557
Personal info is
the new commodity.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.494
I, uh... I understand
three other people

35:30.496 --> 35:32.129
Had their information released.

35:32.131 --> 35:35.232
Well, lomis had access
to 300 phones

35:35.234 --> 35:36.666
And whatever was on them.

35:36.668 --> 35:37.901
We got her.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.837
I mean, we confiscated
all of her devices.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.572
She had plenty of time
to make copies

35:42.574 --> 35:45.642
And distribute them to anyone.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.444
And what they do with it...

35:47.446 --> 35:48.778
Only time will tell.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.516
What's this?

35:52.518 --> 35:54.451
That's me keeping
you in the loop.

35:54.453 --> 35:58.421
I-I still can't believe
that she's just a teenager.

35:58.423 --> 36:01.625
So, colin...
Yeah.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.627
Can I be honest
with you?

36:03.629 --> 36:06.396
I was a little pissed off
I didn't get that promotion.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.564
I was.

36:07.566 --> 36:10.300
I just felt I was

36:10.302 --> 36:12.602
The best man
for the job.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.471
So did I.

36:14.473 --> 36:17.207
I mean-- think that <i>I</i> was
the best man for the job.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.242
Look, I'll-I'll
admit it--

36:19.244 --> 36:21.511
There's not a whole lot
that I know

36:21.513 --> 36:24.848
About what you
and your people do.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.651
That's not
an enviable position.
You're not gonna

36:27.653 --> 36:28.919
Try and hug me now, are you?

36:28.921 --> 36:31.688
No. In fact, my job
practically guarantees

36:31.690 --> 36:33.256
I am gonna be a constant

36:33.258 --> 36:35.559
Pain in your ass.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.628
But listen, I'm the least
of your worries.

36:42.633 --> 36:44.401
Tomorrow's criminal.

36:44.403 --> 36:47.671
That is who you're
gonna lose sleep over.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.739
Good night.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.976
Good night.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.286
What's that?

37:04.689 --> 37:05.989
Postcard.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.724
From lomis?

37:08.960 --> 37:11.595
Sent the moment the prosecutor
released her from custody.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.731
It's not fair.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.733
She gets to walk
because

37:16.735 --> 37:19.469
She happens to be 16,
but she is a criminal.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.638
But she's a cyber criminal.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.673
And we both know that
sentencing guidelines

37:23.675 --> 37:25.675
Make it very difficult
to prosecute

37:25.677 --> 37:27.577
If they're under 21.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.679
It's like we're
encouraging kids

37:29.681 --> 37:31.681
To become black hats.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.717
Well, maybe one day
that law will change.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.720
You need to be very grateful
that we couldn't

37:36.722 --> 37:38.421
Prosecute.
Now, did you

37:38.423 --> 37:40.490
Intend to break the law
or was that accidental?

37:40.492 --> 37:44.561
You had no idea that what
you were doing was illegal.

37:46.297 --> 37:49.432
<i>I know you paid off</i>
<i>the ransomed phone via text.</i>

37:53.638 --> 37:57.741
<i>And with that payment you</i>
<i>bundled a remote access trojan.</i>

37:57.743 --> 37:59.609
<i>That's illegal.</i>

38:03.781 --> 38:05.949
<i>You took control</i>
<i>of lomis' desktop computer</i>

38:05.951 --> 38:09.619
<i>And you snapped a picture.</i>

38:10.888 --> 38:12.889
Krumitz:
<i>Guys. Guys.</i>

38:12.891 --> 38:14.958
I did it.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.360
I finally found lomis.
I got an I.D.

38:17.362 --> 38:18.995
How'd you know?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.697
You told me.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.365
Krumitz:
<i>And she also took first place</i>

38:22.367 --> 38:23.833
In the miami-dade county
high school chess

38:23.835 --> 38:26.670
Tournament. We get it--
she's a genius

38:26.672 --> 38:27.971
And you're a proud father.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.073
You couldn't know
she was a chess champion

38:30.075 --> 38:31.641
Unless you were
in her bedroom,

38:31.643 --> 38:33.810
And I knew
that you weren't. So I

38:33.812 --> 38:36.680
Accessed your bureau files
and I found that photo.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.982
Without my
authorization

38:38.984 --> 38:40.684
And a judge's
subpoena,

38:40.686 --> 38:42.819
You broke the law
when you took that photo.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.088
It was a digital search
without a warrant.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.924
I couldn't let lomis win again.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.926
And I know
this sounds insane,

38:49.928 --> 38:53.563
But I...

38:53.565 --> 38:55.932
I needed to justify your
decision to hire me.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.468
Your belief in me.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.037
I started at the fbi
pushing a mail cart.

39:01.039 --> 39:04.441
And I would've been there
forever, but you found me.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.443
I hadn't been
in ctoc ten minutes

39:06.445 --> 39:08.445
Before I realized
how dedicated you were.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.746
And watching you

39:09.748 --> 39:13.083
Love your job

39:13.085 --> 39:16.019
Made me love my job.

39:18.956 --> 39:21.591
And made me never
want to let you down.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.795
I didn't know what else to do.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.699
That is no excuse.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.835
What if lomis
was a 35-year-old man?

39:31.837 --> 39:33.069
I know. He would have walked.

39:33.071 --> 39:36.106
And I would've been
forced to turn you in.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.510
Today's your lucky day.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.712
Your mistake is not
sending you to prison.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.781
It's dying here with me.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.852
But I want you
to think about something.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.154
Does victory
really taste so sweet

39:51.156 --> 39:53.523
When you haven't
earned it honestly?
