00:01.880 --> 00:04.440
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:37.600 --> 00:39.273
WOMEN: Happy birthday!

00:39.360 --> 00:41.795
I said no fuss.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.992
You have to celebrate
your birthday, Nani.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.034
I was the first woman
married in Pakistan.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.836
Now, look at me, in a wheelchair,

00:50.200 --> 00:51.839
and being fed shop-bought cake.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.515
That's a nice cake.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.076
"The first woman married in Pakistan,"
Did you know this?

00:56.280 --> 00:58.954
And I was the first Muslim woman

00:59.120 --> 01:01.874
to work in a textile mill
in South Yorkshire.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.677
Granddad taking you dancing
every Wednesday night.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
NANI: Oh!

01:06.680 --> 01:08.717
I so miss that man.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.510
Now, I want to give you these things
before it's too late.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.313
Najia, these are some letters

01:15.440 --> 01:17.159
your father wrote to me
when he was away.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.516
- Don't read the filthy bits.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

01:20.040 --> 01:23.317
Sonya, this is a present
your grandfather gave me.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.919
I can't remember why, but it's nice.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.636
And, now, Yasmin,
my favourite granddaughter.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.880
What? Mummy, what?
I've told you about that.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.436
I want you to have this.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.872
Thank you. Was it Granddad's?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.680
I can get it fixed, if you like.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.639
It must never be fixed.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
Why not?

01:52.640 --> 01:54.233
I don't want to talk about it any more.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.715
Nani, please.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.633
NANI: You won't understand.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.080
I have such stories I could tell you.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.634
And we want to hear them, really.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.993
If you don't tell us, we won't know.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.360
Your life's our heritage.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.029
When you're older, maybe.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.760
DOCTOR: <i>I know what you're asking,</i>

02:17.000 --> 02:19.117
<i>but family history and time travel,
very tricky.</i>

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
Just for an hour.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.816
- See her from a distance.
- (GRUNTS)

02:21.840 --> 02:23.736
What's the point in having a mate
with a time machine if you can't

02:23.760 --> 02:25.640
nip back and see your gran
when she was younger?

02:25.920 --> 02:27.149
(SCREAMS)

02:27.920 --> 02:28.956
Erm...

02:33.360 --> 02:34.589
Have you got a time or place?

02:34.760 --> 02:36.592
I know she lived in Lahore in the '50s.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.233
- But other than that...
- I mean, I could.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.950
I shouldn't.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.235
Unless... No. Too unpredictable.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.154
- Could what?
- It's a risk.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.560
Oh, like none of our other trips
have ever been risky.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.670
I have apologised for the death-eye
turtle army. Profusely.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.638
I suppose I could loop this into
the TARDIS' telepathic circuits.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.354
This thing's telepathic, too?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.399
Don't call her a thing, Graham.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.910
And, yes, she does have
telepathic navigation, sort of.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.995
Shorthand for a very complicated process
which is way beyond your understanding.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.356
Ta very much.
I only hang around here to be insulted.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.598
Any object amasses all sorts

03:11.680 --> 03:14.149
of fragmentary spatio-temporal particles
through its life.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.877
The TARDIS can read it like date stamps.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.756
What do you two reckon?

03:19.040 --> 03:20.520
Oh, yeah, I love it. Pakistan.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.416
Never been there before.
Another one off the bucket list.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.776
As long as there's no killer turtles.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.995
Yeah, I'm well up for it.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.997
Hmm. One hour. No...

03:28.080 --> 03:29.520
- ALL: Interfering.
- ...interfering.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.678
(TARDIS POWERING UP)

03:34.080 --> 03:36.117
Go on. You know you can do it.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.749
Bit of a punt.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.353
(TARDIS WHOOSHING)

03:55.360 --> 03:57.431
DOCTOR: Whoa! Nice!

03:58.320 --> 04:00.710
I thought Lahore was a city.
This ain't a city.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.836
(GASPS)

04:05.360 --> 04:06.840
(SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING)

04:11.960 --> 04:13.480
TARDIS readings are all over the shop.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.320
Looks pretty, northern Punjab.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.988
(DISTORTED VOICE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

04:19.440 --> 04:20.760
(COW MOOING)

04:20.839 --> 04:21.990
Hey, get off the road!

04:22.640 --> 04:24.757
Really sorry. Bit of a wobble.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.436
What just happened?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.110
Not sure. But I didn't like it at all.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.920
(MOOING)

04:31.240 --> 04:33.016
Sorry, mate, er, we're just getting
our bearings.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.190
We're not from around here.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.555
Yeah, no kidding.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.480
Your Punjabi's not bad
for foreigners, though.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.875
You need to be careful.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.594
These roads aren't safe right now.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.234
We're actually looking for a woman

04:43.560 --> 04:44.710
by the name of Umbreen.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.560
Right, Umbreen.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
What for?

04:48.280 --> 04:49.520
- We're family.
- We're friends.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.760
Family friends.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.675
We're on our way to say hello.
Bit of a surprise.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.400
But we agreed...

04:59.040 --> 05:00.315
Er, okay, get in.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.558
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

05:07.320 --> 05:08.640
CART DRIVER: Okay?
GRAHAM: Yeah.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.120
GRAHAM: Thank you.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.200
You all right?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.437
I think so. Probably.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.115
I don't know.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.079
Like I intercepted something.
In my brain.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.158
So, what, you're a flower merchant?

05:22.240 --> 05:24.072
Er, pretty much, right now.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.680
- (COW MOOING)
- Why isn't it safe on the roads?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.359
Running transport now, Prem?

05:29.840 --> 05:30.920
Want a ride with us, Sadhu?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.230
I can take one more.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.960
What's wrong with your feet?

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
You young people,

05:36.080 --> 05:37.116
always such a rush.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.720
Walking served me all my life.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.596
I'll be there, don't you worry.
(CHUCKLES)

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
We'll be ready.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.596
I'm late. Umbreen's gonna kill me.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.120
You're late!

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
And who are they?

06:35.640 --> 06:37.074
They're your family, Umbreen.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.120
What?

06:41.120 --> 06:42.270
Oh, my God.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.880
You're Umbreen.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.395
You look amazing.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.390
What are you doing here?

06:48.960 --> 06:49.996
I live here.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.230
On a farm?

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
But I thought...

06:52.880 --> 06:55.349
It doesn't matter.
I'm so happy to see you.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.629
So, Yaz, you should probably
explain who we are.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.033
Sorry, yeah. Excited.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.670
Uncle Malik.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.999
You know Uncle Malik.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.840
There are loads of Uncle Maliks.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.798
Exactly. Well,

07:10.040 --> 07:12.271
the one from about 15 valleys over,

07:12.640 --> 07:16.395
I'm that Uncle Malik's third cousin's
younger sister, Yaz.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.472
And these are my friends, Ryan,
Graham, and the Doctor.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.869
All the way from England.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.040
You might want to keep that to yourself
right now.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.840
- UMBREEN: Right.
- What?

07:27.040 --> 07:29.919
It's just, we weren't expecting you,
or anyone.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.151
Uncle Malik's not coming to the wedding
as well, is he?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.955
- There's a wedding?
- Which is why we're here.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.754
Bringing wedding best wishes.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.271
Erm, when... When's the big day again?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.114
- Tomorrow.
- YASMIN: Amazing.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.680
I can't wait to meet the groom.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.434
You already have.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.797
Remember me? Car, flowers?

07:48.480 --> 07:50.676
- Marrying Umbreen.
- No.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.076
You can't be.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.321
- You're not my...
- A wedding in the Punjab. Bring it on.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.480
I love a wedding. Don't we, boys?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.960
Oh, yeah, I can go to a wedding
every day if I could. Yeah.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.117
Hey, do you need a singer?
I know all the classics.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.536
- Well, latest hits to you lot.
- Er, don't ever let him sing.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.656
We won't be staying long anyway.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.400
Just wanted to convey our best wishes

08:10.000 --> 08:11.229
and then head off.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.997
MAN: Hi, I thought I saw some people
in the cart.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.680
Sorry about his driving.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.480
My baby brother thinks he can do
everything better than me.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.160
I'm Manish.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.551
Come, all of you. It's being announced!

08:28.160 --> 08:29.435
UMBREEN: Coming, Mum.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
Who are they?

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
What's happening?

08:32.400 --> 08:33.976
MANISH: Everyone's waiting
for the announcement.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.639
But I've got advanced information.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
DOCTOR: Okay.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.909
Number one,

08:43.360 --> 08:45.440
the man Umbreen is about to marry
is not my granddad.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.080
- Defo? Totally sure?
- YASMIN: Yes.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.193
For starters, Prem's a Hindu name.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.440
We're Muslim.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.593
And he doesn't look
anything like the photos. It's not him.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.439
And that Umbreen, she's your nan, right?

08:55.560 --> 08:57.233
Yeah, she does look like the photo.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.160
But Prem's wearing the watch
your nani gave you in the future.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.955
So what, she had a secret Hindu
first husband?

09:03.840 --> 09:06.116
Er, Doc, I reckon an hour's
nearly up, mate.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.240
Yeah.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.277
We can't go. I came here for answers.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.835
All I've got is more questions.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.240
I knew this would happen.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.696
MANISH: Can anyone
help me with this?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.279
I'll help. I'm Yaz.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.720
MANISH: Great, thanks, Yaz.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.560
Big moment.
You won't forget this in a hurry.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.274
You're right there.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.076
I shouldn't have come.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.920
I'm too nice.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.760
This is what happens
when you try to be nice.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.360
Who wants to know
what they're listening to in there?

09:30.960 --> 09:31.960
- Yup.
- Yup.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.896
BRITISH NEWSREADER: (ON RADIO)

What borders are they talking about?

09:43.960 --> 09:44.996
Pakistan.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.751
Today, India's officially
cut into pieces.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.479
It's the 17th of August.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.479
And still, you want to go ahead?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.275
Nothing changes, Mum.
We knew this was coming.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.234
Sorry, I don't mean to sound stupid,
what year is it, exactly?

09:58.560 --> 10:01.792
Same year you have in England, 1947.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.035
Partition.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.392
We're in the middle
of the partition of India.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.713
MANISH: Three, two, one.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.834
Is it for the celebrations?

10:12.120 --> 10:14.191
Big celebrations. Welcome to the border.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.636
- PREM: Manish.
- Where India ends and our future begins.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
PREM: What are you doing?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.276
Yaz, hi. (PANTING)

10:20.360 --> 10:23.910
Quick sidebar, August, 1947, Partition.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.720
The borders have just been announced.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.594
India. Pakistan.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.673
It's not just the land
that gets divided.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.194
Rioting in the cities.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.956
Tens of millions of people
about to be displaced.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.719
More than a million about to die.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.630
Doc, meanwhile, her Nan's about
to get married, but not to her Granddad.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.519
I'm thinking
that hour's well up, now.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.070
You can't know the borders.
It's only just been announced!

10:44.280 --> 10:47.000
The maps were leaked weeks ago.
I got one from my sources.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.477
Your sources must be wrong, because
you've just put my house in Pakistan.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.950
With the other Muslims.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.478
But you get a fresh start.

They killed him.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.080
He was your man on the road.

you just saw something not of this world

And you ran at those demons

I don't think they're demons.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.953
Why should I trust what you think?

13:13.240 --> 13:15.296
Because we've got experience
with impossible creatures

13:15.320 --> 13:18.279
and because we ask questions like,
"What is this substance on his body?"

13:22.280 --> 13:23.616

the others back there?

They don't have to know.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.512
Hasna already thinks
the marriage is cursed.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.600
Umbreen doesn't need anything else
to worry about, and Manish,

13:42.080 --> 13:43.673
who knows what he thinks these days.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.271
I was away from him for too long.

It's only later
she'll decide how to tell it.

any of us know the real truth

22:26.160 --> 22:27.160
of our own lives.

Because we're too busy living them
from the inside.

I'm dealing with this.

I've just nicked four of your

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
Good trick, by the way.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.831
Forcing people back,
away from the boundary. Clever.

I'm using it myself, against you,

I made a temporary Transmat barrier
around the farm.

I'm hoping it will keep them out

Are you serious,
after what's just happened?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.920
Can't you see what's happening?
You bring demons to life.

I don't think they're demons.

Twelve. Eighteen at a push.
I can't be sure.

- Why a biscuit?
