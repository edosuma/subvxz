00:01.067 --> 00:03.035
Two weeks ago, I had it all:

00:03.136 --> 00:06.105
Great job, great car, amazing fiancÃ©e.

00:06.206 --> 00:09.573
And then George Michael made a
guest appearance in my living room.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.405
Worst houseguest ever, by the way.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.674
Turns out, it wasn't George Michael.
According to my brother Nate,

00:14.748 --> 00:18.878
it's because I've got an inoperable
brain aneurysm. Bad news, right?

00:18.952 --> 00:21.614
Well, maybe not. Like anything,
it depends who you ask.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.521
Ask an allegedly mystical,
Chinese acupuncturist,

00:24.591 --> 00:27.822
it means I could be some kind of
modern-day prophet. Because, hey,

00:27.894 --> 00:31.386
if God wants to send a message,
who else to send but George Michael?

00:31.464 --> 00:34.331
Now, my assistant just thinks I'm crazy.

00:34.401 --> 00:37.529
My friend thinks these visions
are a sign I need to somehow,

00:37.604 --> 00:39.970
change my life
and start using my legal skills

00:40.073 --> 00:42.598
to make the world a better place.
Blah, blah, blah.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.143
That's what I promised my dad
I'd do 20 years ago.

00:45.211 --> 00:49.170
Though he's been dead for ten of them,
some promises you have to keep.

00:49.282 --> 00:52.410
Anyway, that's what I'm doing
with this coffee can.

00:52.619 --> 00:56.248
See, I promised my dead father, with
whom I share the same brain aneurysm

00:56.322 --> 00:59.985
and potentially prophetic abilities,
that I would dispose of his ashes

01:00.060 --> 01:01.823
here in the Himalayas, which I did.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.896
Now, I just wanna bring the can home.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.831
Mules often use coffee to disguise
the scent of the drugs they transport.

01:07.901 --> 01:11.234
Yeah, but I'm not even
transporting coffee. See?

01:14.007 --> 01:17.170
This doesn't look like coffee to me.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.269
No. No, that would be my dad.

01:20.346 --> 01:23.509
This is crazy! That guy, he just got
two live chickens through!

01:23.583 --> 01:26.711
Suspected contraband can't leave
the country. I'm sorry.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.550
I'm not letting you
on the plane with that can.

01:35.895 --> 01:38.762
Well, What's-Left-of-Dad,
looks like this is goodbye.

01:38.832 --> 01:42.199
Do me a favor, if there
really is somebody up there,

01:42.302 --> 01:45.271
would you ask them to please
leave me alone for this week?

01:47.373 --> 01:49.864
Better yet, just make it a month.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.911
And please, no more visions.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.047
Eli Stone's office, please hold.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.250
- Eli Stone's office, please hold.
- Oh!

02:05.325 --> 02:07.088
Oh, baby, are you OK?

02:08.061 --> 02:13.158
Stone, Eli's office.
Oh, look, just call me back later!

02:13.233 --> 02:16.327
Eli Stone's office, I know
he's supposed to be back today.

02:16.402 --> 02:20.133
I don't know where he is, but when he
gets here I've got dibs on killing him.

02:20.206 --> 02:23.369
- Could you sign for this delivery?
- Just put it on the desk.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.604
Yeah, I don't think these are gonna fit.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.341
He better have shipped himself back
in one of those.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.973
Hey! My crates arrived!

02:31.084 --> 02:34.247
What did you do,
bring back the Great Wall of China?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.346
I was in the Himalayas.
My trip was great, don't I get a hug?

02:37.423 --> 02:38.947
You get one at Christmas.

02:39.025 --> 02:42.324
Patti, the grumpier you are,
the more I know you missed me.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.760
Here, I brought you a gift.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.698
My boss has a nervous breakdown and
all I get is this lousy... What is this?

02:47.767 --> 02:51.498
That is a Saraswati.
The Hindu goddess of wisdom.

02:51.571 --> 02:52.697
How does it work?

02:52.772 --> 02:55.741
Do I hit you in the head with it
and you come to your senses?

02:55.842 --> 02:58.606
My senses are fine.
They're better than fine.

02:58.678 --> 03:03.638
Two blissful song-free weeks, Patti.
I didn't even hear Muzak in an elevator.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.844
Everything's back to normal
and it's gonna stay that way.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.447
Does that mean we're done suing
the firm and risking our jobs?

03:10.523 --> 03:14.789
Yeah. Even if we weren't, I got a piece
of paper saying they can't fire me.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.887
What does the paper say
about not firing me?

03:19.999 --> 03:21.557
I thought so.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.603
Eli Stone's office, please hold.

03:26.673 --> 03:30.541
...pleased to announce we'll be
acquiring Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar

03:30.610 --> 03:32.578
as our new London branch.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.015
Welcome back to Mr. Stone,
newly returned from his...

03:37.083 --> 03:39.347
- Nervous breakdown.
... sabbatical.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.853
It's good to be back.
When I say "back," I mean,

03:41.921 --> 03:44.856
back in the fullest sense of the...

03:44.924 --> 03:47.415
No more suing the firm, basically.

03:47.493 --> 03:49.791
And we're all grateful for that.

03:50.763 --> 03:54.392
Next item: United States v.
Solinsky, et al.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.402
Sir, I found some precedent
in the library on point with...

03:57.470 --> 04:01.406
If you're referring to Allston v.
Beckridge, that's a Second Circuit case,

04:01.474 --> 04:03.408
I footnoted it in my pre-trial memo.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.036
You haven't been assigned to this yet,
Mr. Dowd.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.046
An encouraging word, that "yet. "

04:08.114 --> 04:10.605
Yet Mr. Dowd is already
extremely busy with Hanson.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.117
Which'll be finished
by the time Solinsky starts.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.552
Whereas another associate,
better rested,

04:15.622 --> 04:17.589
coming off a $5.2 million dollar win...

04:17.690 --> 04:20.591
True enough.
Mr. Stone, the case is yours.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.686
Come see me in my office later
to share your thoughts on it.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.893
Next item: Ramirez, et al. V.
Gro Plus Farms?

04:27.967 --> 04:29.628
Oh, that's, mine, sir.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.603
Maggie Dekker. It's a workers
comp claim I brought in.

04:32.672 --> 04:36.233
Country's third largest food
manufacturer. How did you retain them?

04:36.309 --> 04:40.268
I haven't. We'd be representing
the workers seeking compensation.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.645
Well, unfortunately,
or from my perspective, fortunately,

04:43.716 --> 04:47.243
it's policy not to allow first year
associates to take on new matters,

04:47.320 --> 04:48.582
- so unless...
- I thought

04:48.655 --> 04:52.318
this case might be in Mr. Stone's
particular wheelhouse.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.323
Unwinnable cases aren't a wheelhouse.
I'll be busy with Solinsky. Pass.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.297
- But I thought...
- I'll pass. Thanks.

04:59.365 --> 05:03.734
Very well. Moving on, I understand
we've filed a 12-b-six in Dolan.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.169
Let's just be mindful...

05:14.213 --> 05:17.774
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

05:17.850 --> 05:19.909
Make it stop!
The music, it's back.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.285
Doctor Chen with patient now.
You get manners, come back later.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.450
- I need to talk to you now.
- Sign outside say "In Session. "

05:26.526 --> 05:29.495
- Not "Eli Bother Dr. Chen All Time!"
- It's important.

05:31.631 --> 05:34.532
Very sorry. This patient impatient.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.761
You sleep five minute.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.174
Dude, that is so not cool!

05:43.242 --> 05:46.609
Not cool is hearing a choir
during your morning staff meeting.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.010
Makes sense.

05:48.081 --> 05:52.017
Choral music originated with Ambrosian
Hymnography in the Fourth Century.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.246
I didn't come here
for a theology seminar,

05:54.354 --> 05:58.381
Stick me with a needle, so my life
can stop providing its own soundtrack.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.950
- What was the choir singing?
- I don't know!

06:02.028 --> 06:04.997
And I don't care! I was
supposed to be done with all this.

06:05.064 --> 06:09.160
I took the case, won the case, took my
dad's ashes and went to the Himalayas.

06:09.235 --> 06:12.204
Now it's supposed to be over.
I need it to be over.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.671
- It doesn't work that way.
- How does it work?

06:14.774 --> 06:18.141
I don't know. I never had a patient
who could be a prophet before.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.735
- And stop saying I'm a prophet!
- Well, OK.

06:20.813 --> 06:24.249
But for the record, that's exactly what
a prophet might say.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.684
I don't want to be a prophet, OK?
I want to be a lawyer. A good one.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.689
The one I used to be.
Now, are you gonna help me or not?

06:30.757 --> 06:34.989
Just chill. Do exactly what you did
last time. Follow the signs.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.325
If things get really bad, come see me.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.558
I'll give you a little needle action.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.964
And next time you barge in like that,
bro, I'm billing you for the session.

06:45.471 --> 06:46.961
OK.

06:48.307 --> 06:49.535
God.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.745
- What is that smell?
- It's the candle.

06:55.815 --> 06:59.774
It's made from yak hooves.
It's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.811
Mmm...

07:02.889 --> 07:06.256
Or not. Taylor,
it's been two weeks since we...

07:06.325 --> 07:08.555
It's been over two weeks.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.994
Last time it was
George Michael interruptus.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.588
- He's doing a concert in the Maldives.
- Cute.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.999
But we both know George Michael
was caused by the brain aneurysm

07:17.069 --> 07:20.163
- we're not talking about.
- I'm not talking with anyone.

07:20.239 --> 07:23.299
- I'm trying to keep this quiet.
- Have you had more episodes?

07:24.644 --> 07:28.080
What, like hearing a choir?

07:28.147 --> 07:32.311
- Anything.
- No. No episodes. I'm perfectly fine.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.849
If I engage in strenuous
physical activity with you,

07:35.955 --> 07:38.822
without a discussion establishing
informed consent,

07:38.891 --> 07:42.759
I could be held civilly, or worse,
criminally liable for whatever happens.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.922
It turns me on
when you talk lawyer-like.

07:44.997 --> 07:48.660
- Even more than yak hooves?
- A lot more than yak hooves.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.136
What is it?

08:00.213 --> 08:02.044
It's nothing. It's nothing at all.

08:02.114 --> 08:05.277
I'm just so excited to make
love to my fiancÃ©e,

08:05.384 --> 08:07.352
without any musical accompaniment!

08:30.076 --> 08:32.135
Eli, what's going on?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.678
It's nothing.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.786
First George Michael
and now a boys' choir?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.020
I'm worried where this might be going.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.392
Less joking, more doctoring.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.625
Out of curiosity,
what song were they singing?

08:53.733 --> 08:56.702
If you must know, Freedom,
they were singing Freedom.

08:56.769 --> 09:00.466
So, you're not being chased by George
Michael anymore, just his catalog?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.634
I've got a time bomb in my brain
and my brother is making jokes.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.577
Not just making jokes.
I'm sending out your case for consults,

09:07.647 --> 09:10.673
I'm trading e-mails with
the Mayo Clinic, Walton Center,

09:10.750 --> 09:12.911
- Tiantan Puhua, even.
- What do they say?

09:12.985 --> 09:16.751
Given the location of the aneurysm,
surgery is a bad idea.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.187
Define "bad. "

09:19.859 --> 09:22.692
Loss of motor skills,
you could end up a vegetable...

09:22.762 --> 09:26.425
My odds go up if someone more competent
than you performs the surgery?

09:26.499 --> 09:27.989
Not by much.

09:29.135 --> 09:33.071
Mom told me about the reason for
your Himalaya trip, about Dad's ashes.

09:34.373 --> 09:38.537
That was pretty...
... stupid of you, Eli.

09:38.644 --> 09:42.080
You shouldn't be doing things like that
given your medical situation.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.877
Nate...

09:45.217 --> 09:47.276
...do you think there could be some

09:48.154 --> 09:52.887
greater significance to me and Dad
having the same condition?

09:55.161 --> 09:58.927
Absolutely.
It's called genetics, dumb-ass.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.559
You also have Mom's eczema
and Uncle Gary's terminal lameness.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.398
Please stay off of mountaintops.

10:12.912 --> 10:15.847
Yeah, Stone... Eli Stone.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.475
No, Dr. Chen said...

10:18.551 --> 10:21.714
No, no, I don't have an appointment.
I'm trying to make one.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.013
No, do you...

10:30.630 --> 10:32.188
I'll you call back.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.184
Are you all right?

11:02.561 --> 11:05.689
- What the hell happened to you?
- It's a long story.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.997
Check to see if anyone saw a biplane
flying around downtown today and

11:10.069 --> 11:13.436
get me a list of all the boys' choirs
in Northern California.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.100
And which matter
should I bill this time to?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.201
- Special Projects.
- Special Projects.

11:19.278 --> 11:22.042
- Like planning your engagement party?
- Just like that.

11:22.148 --> 11:26.050
At least I understand what I'm doing
with the party. But choirs and biplanes?

11:26.118 --> 11:28.643
- Why am I doing this?
- Not quite sure yet.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.484
Excuse me, Mr. Stone?

11:33.559 --> 11:36.687
I'm only five years older than you.
Stop calling me Mr. Stone.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.526
I lean on formality when someone
doesn't know who I am.

11:39.598 --> 11:43.557
I know you, first year associate. You
said your name yesterday. It's Mary.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.729
- It's Maggie, actually.
- I was kidding.

11:45.805 --> 11:49.070
I recognize your name from the e-mails
about the Gro Plus case.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.837
You are the reason
they invented spam blockers.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.277
- Did you read them?
- I skimmed the first one.

11:54.346 --> 11:57.713
- I deleted the 49 others.
- Well, here. Try a hardcopy.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.911
- Does the case get better on paper?
- The case is open and shut.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.353
The pesticide Gro Plus uses
on it's farms made our client sterile.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.585
First of all, we don't have any clients,
so there is no "our. "

12:07.660 --> 12:11.221
Secondly, the only illegal alien
that a jury sympathizes with is E.T.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.456
And maybe Alf.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.989
Being farmhands doesn't
automatically make them illegal aliens.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.036
Oscar and Blanca came to this country

12:18.137 --> 12:20.833
and bought into
the American dream wholeheartedly.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.137
- Which explains the lawsuit.
- But it's a legit claim.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.976
There's evidence linking chlorophosphate
with reproductive problems.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.208
These people are the tip
of a very large iceberg.

12:31.283 --> 12:35.014
Half the workers on Gro Plus's farms
are experiencing health problems,

12:35.087 --> 12:37.351
impaired vision,
bronchial infections...

12:37.423 --> 12:39.914
None of which is relevant
to a claim of sterility.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.254
Look, you want my advice?

12:41.327 --> 12:43.887
Tell our non-clients
to quit their jobs and adopt.

12:50.469 --> 12:52.437
You're a gifted trial lawyer, Eli.

12:52.538 --> 12:56.235
Your work on the Beutel trial confirmed
that which I've long suspected.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.607
- I have a professional death wish?
- You're a phenomenal talent.

12:59.678 --> 13:05.048
But yes, your recent behavior has been
the cause of some concern.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.676
It's recent, sir, but temporary.

13:08.587 --> 13:12.614
That's what I wanted to hear. Solinsky
is one of the most significant trials

13:12.691 --> 13:15.251
this firm has the good fortune
to handle in years.

13:15.361 --> 13:18.091
Well, you're giving it to
the right associate, sir.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.529
Good.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.463
So... your thoughts?

13:22.001 --> 13:24.697
Firstly, I noticed that
you're preparing a motion

13:24.770 --> 13:26.863
- to strike time-barred claims.
- Yes.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.635
Martin Posner's been drafting
the brief himself.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.233
I think it's a loser
no matter who drafts it.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.676
- You're suggesting a motion in limine.
- It'll not only be more effective,

13:37.750 --> 13:40.844
it'll get filed
closer to the start of the trial,

13:40.920 --> 13:43.218
so we will catch the other side
off guard.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.657
Eli?

13:52.398 --> 13:54.332
- Sir, you should get down!
- Get what?

13:54.400 --> 13:55.890
Get down!

13:59.371 --> 14:01.839
- Eli?
- Sir, I can explain.

14:01.907 --> 14:05.274
- I'd like that very much.
- There was a glare on the building,

14:05.377 --> 14:09.541
and it looked like there was something
flying towards the...

14:11.016 --> 14:12.643
Oscar Ramirez...

14:12.718 --> 14:17.052
- Oh, my God. He's a pilot.
- Who's a pilot?

14:19.058 --> 14:22.425
Do you mind if we can continue
the Solinsky discussion in a week?

14:22.528 --> 14:26.430
- A week?
- There's a case I have to lose first.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.282
Those for trial,
or are you planning a wedding?

14:44.350 --> 14:47.717
Trial binders: Pleadings,
precedent, deposition transcripts,

14:47.786 --> 14:50.687
scientific studies color-coded
and cross-indexed.

14:50.756 --> 14:54.385
You got permission to take the case
yesterday. How'd you get that done?

14:54.460 --> 14:58.089
I figured I'd get permission eventually,
I've been working weekends.

14:58.163 --> 15:02.725
You're supposed to work for the firm
on cases that aren't dead-bang losers.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.327
For a guy who's coming off a huge win,
you don't have much confidence.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.340
Don't mistake a grip on reality
for lack of confidence.

15:09.408 --> 15:13.139
There are causation, proof, and
contributory negligence problems.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.943
Gro Plus is gonna say the Ramirezes
are to blame for Blanca's sterility?

15:17.016 --> 15:19.712
- No. I know that's for sure.
- Oh.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.889
So you didn't wear the safety mask
provided by Gro Plus?

15:23.989 --> 15:27.049
I didn't have to. I flew the plane
which sprayed the pesticide.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.060
I'm not the one who was hurt.
My wife was.

15:29.128 --> 15:33.064
Object to the answer as non-responsive.
To the term "hurt," to the speculation.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.793
Move to strike,
ask to instruct the witness.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.835
Object to all the objections,
Your Honor.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.699
Just get on with it, boys.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.502
What about the safety lectures
Gro Plus held?

15:42.574 --> 15:45.873
- How many did you and your wife attend?
- None.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.904
Had you attended, you might've picked up
a tip or two about the safety mask?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.283
Pass the witness.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.884
- What is this, Mr. Ramirez?
- It's a bandana.

16:01.593 --> 16:04.460
- And what does Gro Plus call it?
- A "safety mask. "

16:04.530 --> 16:07.897
Does that make the safety lectures
a company-wide knitting circle?

16:07.967 --> 16:11.459
- Do I even have to object?
- Move it along, counsel.

16:12.271 --> 16:15.536
Gro Plus only has these lectures
to protect themselves.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.768
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

16:17.876 --> 16:21.141
Mr. Ramirez, I think the point is,
if you and your wife knew

16:21.213 --> 16:24.273
the pesticide was dangerous,
why you weren't more careful?

16:24.350 --> 16:27.285
We tried to protect
ourselves against the pesticide.

16:27.353 --> 16:30.914
But what we should've been protecting
ourselves against was Gro Plus.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.415
Pass the witness.

16:35.461 --> 16:39.227
All these other supposedly barren,
allegedly heartbroken people,

16:39.331 --> 16:42.789
- why didn't they join your lawsuit?
- They don't live here legally.

16:42.868 --> 16:46.964
They didn't go to a notario and sign the
papers. They are afraid of deportation.

16:47.039 --> 16:50.202
All this is just you being charitable,
Mr. Ramirez,

16:50.309 --> 16:54.268
- standing up for the disenfranchised.
- That's what people do in America.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.974
They stand up for what is right.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.916
I'm concerned about Eli.
I'm hearing some rumors

16:59.985 --> 17:04.080
of erratic behavior on his part.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.521
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

17:06.592 --> 17:09.152
He tried to tackle me yesterday.

17:09.228 --> 17:12.163
I'm worried about him, sweetheart.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.459
- Do you know why?
- Something about a glare.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.365
So... is everything OK with Eli?

17:20.439 --> 17:24.204
Everything's perfectly fine, Dad.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.742
Yes?

17:28.247 --> 17:31.808
This is regarding
the Berkman anti-trust case.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.181
Could we take a rain check on lunch?

17:34.253 --> 17:35.811
Always.

17:35.921 --> 17:38.082
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetie.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.782
Yeah.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.164
Hey, Patti.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.169
Eli's not back from court yet, is he?

17:52.237 --> 17:56.537
Not yet, no. He's probably out
looking for choirs or biplanes

17:56.608 --> 17:59.168
- or Huey Lewis.
- What?

17:59.244 --> 18:02.941
Don't worry about it. Par for the course
around here. What happened?

18:03.015 --> 18:06.473
Chip a nail? Your roots
starting to grow out again?

18:06.552 --> 18:10.454
Look, Patti, I don't know why I've
always rubbed you the wrong way,

18:10.522 --> 18:14.083
but I know I do. It's just,
given everything that's happened to Eli,

18:14.193 --> 18:17.219
- I think we should be uniting.
- I'll be the first to admit

18:17.296 --> 18:21.062
Eli's acting like he's been
free-basing copier toner,

18:21.133 --> 18:24.500
but maybe you're overreacting.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.833
If I can't overreact
to a brain aneurysm,

18:26.905 --> 18:29.169
what can I overreact to, right?

18:29.775 --> 18:32.073
Well, that's a good point.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.613
- Thanks, Patti.
- Sure.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.846
No problem.

18:42.688 --> 18:47.387
This is good, right? First day of trial,
he already wants to settle.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.622
We don't know that's what he wants.
So, poker face, OK?

18:50.696 --> 18:52.323
- OK. Yeah.
- OK.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.895
What are you offering?

18:56.969 --> 19:00.336
I mean, whatever it is,
it better be good.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.134
Oh, it's very good.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.903
You dismiss the case, with prejudice.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.605
- And?
- No "and. "

19:07.679 --> 19:09.806
Isn't there usually an "and?"

19:09.882 --> 19:11.747
What my associate means is,

19:11.817 --> 19:15.184
the defense will offer a financial
incentive for a dismissal.

19:15.254 --> 19:18.087
In this case, the incentive
would be un-financial.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.888
Mmm. Like a lifetime supply
of Gro Plus canned goods?

19:21.960 --> 19:26.124
- Like avoiding deportation.
- Even under the current administration,

19:26.198 --> 19:29.167
I doubt Homeland Security
can deport American citizens.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.236
See, now that's the ironic thing.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.668
This morning, Mr. Ramirez
testified he and his wife

19:34.740 --> 19:37.641
had both been naturalized
by someone called a notario.

19:37.709 --> 19:41.008
Now, most of these notarios
are notorious

19:41.079 --> 19:43.240
for not having naturalized anybody.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.875
They collect their fee, have the clients
sign some bogus papers,

19:46.952 --> 19:50.615
at the end of the day, said clients
are about as American as Kim Jong-il.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.180
Bottom line, your clients were duped.

19:53.992 --> 19:57.723
Even so, it'll take months before
Immigration moves on this.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.688
Homeland Security seems to find a reason
to speed things along

20:01.767 --> 20:05.032
when the immigrant in question
is a pilot with access to a plane.

20:07.739 --> 20:12.438
Your blackmail, excuse me, offer,
is rejected. I'll see you in court.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.887
But we are Americans.
We passed the test.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.121
We answered all the questions.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.197
We were so proud.

20:32.264 --> 20:35.392
We saluted the flag, the notario
even had us swear on a Bible.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.628
Yeah, he should've
been the one to do that.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.830
I think they would be arresting
this man, not deporting us.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.637
They're going to be doing both.
But I'm going to fight the deportation.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.837
The problem is,
I have to do it right now.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.210
Then, who's gonna represent us
in the trial?

20:52.117 --> 20:54.085
Wait, Eli. I'm not ready for this.

20:54.186 --> 20:58.020
I can't be in two courtrooms at the same
time. At least this case, you know.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.253
Just go in there, make a stupid motion,
and run out the clock.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.920
- A stupid motion?
- Yes, you should be good at that.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.590
Now just wait a minute. I almost got it.

21:14.873 --> 21:17.535
They make it so darn difficult
for these to operate.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.472
Can I...

21:21.480 --> 21:27.214
Hmm. Let the record show that
the counselor is good at electronics.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.846
Your Honor, Oscar and Blanca
Ramirez are...

21:29.955 --> 21:33.914
- We haven't heard from Immigration.
- The respondents are not wrongdoers.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.460
They acted in what they thought
was compliance with the law.

21:36.528 --> 21:40.294
I presided over a case in which
the defendant thought he was Batman.

21:40.365 --> 21:43.732
- It didn't make it so.
- Your Honor, you can't deport citizens

21:43.835 --> 21:45.564
because of someone else's fraud.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.767
They're not law-abiding citizens or they
wouldn't be in the country illegally.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.469
Unless you show cause why the
defendants shouldn't be deported...

21:52.544 --> 21:55.638
- I can show cause, Your Honor.
- Great. Now would be the time.

21:55.714 --> 21:59.411
I just... I can't do it this particular
minute. My cause isn't here.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.714
- I need a continuance.
- We just started.

22:01.787 --> 22:05.314
Forty-eight hours, judge, then
I'll be right back here with my cause.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.626
Forty-eight hours.

22:10.696 --> 22:15.258
Mrs. Ramirez, tell us how you first
learned that you were infertile.

22:15.367 --> 22:19.098
- Objection.
- In the form of a question, counsel.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.264
Right. Like Jeopardy.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.201
You and your husband

22:24.276 --> 22:28.610
visited a fertility doctor, did you not?

22:28.680 --> 22:33.447
The doctor, he did some tests.
And he said that it was my fault.

22:33.518 --> 22:38.285
And you blame the pesticide used
on Gro Plus's farm. Isn't that right?

22:38.390 --> 22:42.156
Yes, other women I work with,
they can't have children.

22:42.227 --> 22:46.891
And we all work in the fields. And when
we go home, we can smell the chemicals.

22:46.965 --> 22:50.128
They're on our clothes,
and we can taste it in our mouths.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.449
Where did you meet your husband?

23:05.517 --> 23:08.281
At Gro Plus, on the farm.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.346
So it stands to reason that there was
never a time when you and your husband

23:12.457 --> 23:16.359
were trying to get pregnant
before you went to work for Gro Plus.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.357
Hang on. Step back through, sir.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.495
Check your pockets again.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.596
Sorry.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.197
I thought I had all of it...

23:32.677 --> 23:34.770
- Come on through, sir.
- OK.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.650
Well, Mrs. Ramirez?
Isn't it possible you were infertile

23:40.719 --> 23:43.688
before you were exposed
to the pesticide on the farm?

23:43.755 --> 23:45.518
No, I'm sure that it's not.

23:45.590 --> 23:49.151
- You've tried to get pregnant before?
- No, I haven't tried.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.320
So how do you know?

23:52.697 --> 23:54.562
Objection, Your Honor.

23:54.633 --> 23:58.000
To his tone. I don't like his tone.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.560
Overruled, Miss Dekker. Continue.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.765
Mrs. Ramirez,

24:01.840 --> 24:05.276
I doubt you'd been to a fertility clinic
before you met your husband.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.709
This is your first marriage.
How can you be sure

24:07.813 --> 24:09.974
that you weren't infertile before?

24:14.820 --> 24:18.381
I know that I could have babies before.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.762
He doesn't know, does he?

24:29.835 --> 24:34.568
Who doesn't know what? I mean,
objection! Who doesn't know what?

24:35.240 --> 24:40.542
I... I had a baby before I met Oscar.

24:40.612 --> 24:44.104
And I gave him up for adoption.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.047
Oscar, I'm so sorry.

24:48.119 --> 24:51.213
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

24:51.289 --> 24:55.419
If you could deceive
your own husband, Mrs. Ramirez,

24:55.494 --> 24:58.986
how is this jury to know
you're not deceiving them?

25:01.967 --> 25:03.628
What'd I miss?

25:09.307 --> 25:11.434
- Can I talk yet?
- No.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.771
- Now?
- Not yet.

25:19.751 --> 25:23.448
I left you to deal with the fallout
from Maggie Screw-up Number One,

25:23.522 --> 25:26.582
I told you to stall! If the judge
told you to stop stalling,

25:26.658 --> 25:29.889
- I told you to start objecting!
- I did! I'm sorry.

25:29.961 --> 25:32.225
You're sorry?
Before the Ramirezes met you,

25:32.297 --> 25:35.789
they were happily married American
citizens. Now they're neither.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.893
OK, deportation aside,
this is good for us, isn't it?

25:38.970 --> 25:43.339
It's evidence that Blanca had no problem
conceiving before working for Gro Plus.

25:43.408 --> 25:47.504
It would have been good if we knew ahead
our infertile client was a mommy!

25:47.579 --> 25:50.139
Now, all the jury sees is a liar.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.183
Juries don't give money to liars.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.117
She didn't even tell her husband!
How was I to know?

25:55.186 --> 25:57.154
You're expected to find out.

25:57.255 --> 25:59.086
Now I'm going to lose two cases.

25:59.157 --> 26:01.717
I promised the judge
proof our clients are legal,

26:01.826 --> 26:04.795
which is gonna be hard to produce
since they're not.

26:04.896 --> 26:08.024
You're yelling about malpractice
after you lied to a judge?

26:08.099 --> 26:11.660
I wouldn't have lied if you hadn't
gotten me in this in the first place.

26:11.736 --> 26:15.672
There's two kinds of lawyers, Maggie.
Good lawyers and there's bad lawyers.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.437
And a bad lawyer with good intentions
is still a bad lawyer.

26:19.511 --> 26:23.003
I may be a bad lawyer, but I'll
get better. You'll always be a jerk.

26:35.794 --> 26:40.254
There's 53 boys' choirs in Northern
California? This is gonna take forever.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.096
Do me a favor. Find out
which ones wear red and white.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.136
Sure thing, boss.

26:45.236 --> 26:48.865
Wait a second. I've got a mom
and a fiancÃ©e. I know that tone.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.670
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.

26:51.743 --> 26:53.643
You didn't say anything, either.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.571
Patti, I'm having a very bad day here,

26:57.649 --> 27:00.277
the new "bad" that
I've been working with lately.

27:00.352 --> 27:04.482
Eight years we've been together, Eli.
My daughters call you uncle.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.719
When my husband left me,
when my father passed away,

27:07.792 --> 27:10.158
you were the first call I made.

27:10.228 --> 27:13.061
You have a brain aneurysm

27:13.131 --> 27:16.362
and I have to find out about it
from Malibu Barbie?

27:16.501 --> 27:19.026
- She told you?
- She thought I knew.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.937
And for the life of me,
I can't figure out why I didn't.

27:22.007 --> 27:25.033
Eli, I thought you trusted me.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.476
I do. I do trust you.

27:27.545 --> 27:32.278
I just, the more people I tell,
the more real it becomes.

27:32.350 --> 27:35.012
Eli, I'm not people.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.848
Are you going to die?

27:39.357 --> 27:43.123
Eventually. Just not
anytime soon, I hope.

27:43.194 --> 27:47.358
Well, you keep anything else from me,
and that's gonna change.

27:51.903 --> 27:54.929
I didn't mean to tell her.
I thought she already knew.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.975
- No else can find out, OK? No one.
- If you mean my father,

27:58.043 --> 28:00.944
I didn't say anything.
I would never do that to you.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.845
Because I can't lose my job
on top of everything else.

28:03.915 --> 28:06.213
They can't fire you
for having an aneurysm.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.718
You think I could keep
my insurance with this?

28:08.787 --> 28:11.881
No insurance means no license
and no license means no job.

28:11.956 --> 28:14.584
Except for the last 48 hours,
I like my job.

28:14.659 --> 28:18.390
- What's happened in the last 48 hours?
- What difference does it make?

28:19.864 --> 28:23.197
You won't talk about your condition,
won't talk about work...

28:23.268 --> 28:24.758
You're acting erratically

28:24.836 --> 28:29.170
and every time I reach out to you to see
what's wrong, to see if I can help,

28:29.240 --> 28:31.936
- you push me away.
- I just want things to be normal.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.138
Have they been normal?
Or have you, I don't know,

28:35.213 --> 28:37.477
tried to tackle anyone lately?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.915
- That was a misunderstanding.
- Really?

28:40.018 --> 28:42.179
You haven't had any more episodes? Any?

28:48.393 --> 28:50.486
Look...

28:50.562 --> 28:54.259
...I admit that when we found out
about the aneurysm,

28:54.332 --> 28:56.664
I reacted horribly.

28:58.303 --> 29:02.467
But I want to be there for you now.
I'm ready to be. Why won't you let me?

29:02.540 --> 29:04.701
I know you need to talk about this.

29:04.809 --> 29:08.245
But right now, I really need
to not talk about it.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.543
And since I'm the guy
with the aneurysm...

29:10.615 --> 29:12.515
You might have the aneurysm, Eli.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.553
But you're not the only one
who has to live with it.

29:22.026 --> 29:24.119
Has the jury reached a verdict?

29:24.195 --> 29:26.163
We have, Your Honor.

29:27.065 --> 29:31.024
In the matter of Ramirez v.
Gro Plus Foods Incorporated,

29:31.136 --> 29:35.596
we find in favor of the defendant,
Gro Plus Foods.

29:48.253 --> 29:49.880
How you doing, Oscar?

29:50.421 --> 29:54.517
My wife had another man's baby.
I've had better days.

29:55.693 --> 29:59.459
She got pregnant before she met you.
Right after she came to America.

29:59.531 --> 30:02.159
She left the baby in a church.
She didn't name him.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.394
Are you judging her for that?

30:04.502 --> 30:08.563
No. She was young and scared.
But she wasn't young

30:08.640 --> 30:12.371
and she wasn't scared when she decided
not to tell me she'd been a mother.

30:12.443 --> 30:15.776
I'll give you the young part,
but I think she was very scared.

30:16.681 --> 30:19.241
I recently found out
some things about myself.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.276
And I've had a hard time
talking to people about it,

30:23.354 --> 30:25.515
particularly to the people
I'm closest to.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.359
Sometimes the closer you are to someone,

30:30.428 --> 30:32.988
the harder it is
to tell them your secrets.

30:33.097 --> 30:36.430
- That doesn't make it right.
- No, it doesn't.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.230
It just makes it human.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.500
You should get
some sleep tonight, Mr. Stone.

30:43.608 --> 30:44.973
Tomorrow's the big one, huh?

30:45.443 --> 30:48.378
I like this country.
I hate to have to leave.

30:50.415 --> 30:52.849
No pressure there, Oscar.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.226
Mr. Stone, given your proximity,

32:17.335 --> 32:20.270
I'm assuming there's something
you wanted to say to me?

32:22.307 --> 32:25.208
I love the tie, sir.
I was just wondering the make?

32:26.744 --> 32:28.905
- Armani.
- Oh.

32:30.081 --> 32:33.448
Is that it? Or have you given more
thought to our conversation?

32:33.518 --> 32:38.080
I did give it some thought, sir, and I
think it needs another day of thought.

32:44.696 --> 32:45.822
I followed the signs.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.957
All it's gotten me is two clients
who are gonna get deported,

32:49.033 --> 32:50.295
and a case I lost.

32:50.368 --> 32:53.496
You lost one of them. Not the big one.

32:53.571 --> 32:56.631
Everybody needs to stop calling
tomorrow "the big one. "

32:56.708 --> 32:59.268
I'm just saying,
maybe you took the pesticide case

32:59.377 --> 33:01.937
so you'd be the attorney
for the immigration one.

33:02.013 --> 33:05.574
Well, if this choir's supposed to give
me a clue as to how to help them,

33:05.650 --> 33:08.016
then God needs to be
a little less oblique.

33:08.086 --> 33:11.453
You're not gonna win every case, Eli.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.581
You probably won't win most of them.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.286
I sense another use
of the P-word coming.

33:16.361 --> 33:20.525
Most prophets worked for social justice,
but didn't achieve it in their lifetime.

33:20.631 --> 33:24.795
Oh, that's great, so when I die,
they're gonna win on appeal?

33:24.869 --> 33:27.565
I'm getting the ass-end
of this arrangement, man.

33:28.139 --> 33:30.073
Could be worse.

33:30.141 --> 33:33.599
You could've spent ten hours hidden
in the back of a flat bed truck

33:33.678 --> 33:36.112
to come and get a job
for three dollars an hour,

33:36.180 --> 33:39.513
picking strawberries in the
90 degree sun, 12 hours a day.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.519
Turns out the pesticide the farm used
made you infertile,

33:42.587 --> 33:44.680
but that's the least of your worries.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.281
That citizenship test you took
was a fraud, so...

33:47.358 --> 33:51.727
...they're going to deport you to the
country you risked everything to leave.

33:52.530 --> 33:56.296
You know, you may just have written
my closing for me.

34:03.841 --> 34:06.401
As soon as I can get
this damn thing working

34:06.477 --> 34:09.742
the record will reflect that...

34:09.813 --> 34:11.543
The rec... Ah!

34:11.616 --> 34:15.382
The record will reflect
that the respondents are present.

34:15.485 --> 34:18.649
I hope your evidence of citizenship
is present as well, counselor.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.657
They're one and the same, Your Honor.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.956
And if you'll permit me to call
Oscar Ramirez to the stand,

34:24.027 --> 34:27.190
- I can produce that reason.
- You told me you could show cause

34:27.297 --> 34:29.960
why the respondent
shouldn't be deported.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.592
And I can, Your Honor.

34:31.668 --> 34:36.163
Mr. Ramirez, how many amendments
to the Constitution are there?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.706
Twenty-seven.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.504
How many congressmen
in the House of Representatives?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.636
- 435.
- Objection.

34:41.712 --> 34:45.443
See how easy that was? Your Honor,
these questions are taken directly

34:45.516 --> 34:47.780
from the USCIS's Naturalization Exam.

34:47.851 --> 34:49.911
But I'm not administering this test now.

34:49.987 --> 34:53.353
But could you take it?
What are the voting rights amendments?

34:55.326 --> 34:57.988
Fifteen, 19, 24, and 26.

34:58.062 --> 35:00.963
The Twenty-Sixth Amendment
says no state or government

35:01.032 --> 35:04.593
can deny a person of 18 years of age,
or older, the right to vote.

35:04.702 --> 35:08.160
- Some states could allow...
- Start telling me how this is relevant

35:08.239 --> 35:09.399
or you're in contempt.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.271
These questions are
our standard of naturalization.

35:12.376 --> 35:14.810
After a candidate has been
fingerprinted and photographed,

35:14.879 --> 35:18.406
after they've completed a naturalization
application and interview,

35:18.483 --> 35:20.610
and after they've been sworn under oath.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.153
Yeah, that definitely
would have been easier.

35:23.221 --> 35:26.247
Instead, they doused themselves
with water so they wouldn't dehydrate

35:26.324 --> 35:28.758
when crammed into
a hidden compartment of a truck.

35:28.826 --> 35:31.454
They didn't do it
so they could pick strawberries.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.089
They did it because
they believed in America.

35:34.198 --> 35:38.134
In Russia, Iraq, and Afghanistan,
we're seeing first hand,

35:38.202 --> 35:41.569
the seeds of democracy,
they don't grow on every patch of Earth.

35:41.672 --> 35:46.109
The freedom we have here is unique.
It's special.

35:46.177 --> 35:50.238
And Oscar and Blanca Ramirez, they were
willing to risk their lives for it.

35:50.314 --> 35:54.478
I'm not saying citizenship should be
a prize for making it over the border,

35:54.585 --> 35:58.146
and I'm not saying that illegal
immigration isn't a major issue

35:58.222 --> 36:02.249
facing this country, but Oscar and
Blanca Ramirez are not a policy...

36:03.227 --> 36:05.058
...they're people.

36:05.129 --> 36:08.030
And if this truly is the
"home of the brave,"

36:08.099 --> 36:11.830
then they're just as American
as anyone in this room.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.065
Two years? What does that mean?

36:15.139 --> 36:18.165
You have two years to complete
the naturalization process.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.107
No deportation?

36:20.178 --> 36:22.840
- No deportation.
- Welcome to America.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.843
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.545
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.587
So do you guys have any plans?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.124
I'm going to find my son.

36:35.259 --> 36:38.160
No. We're going to find our son.

36:39.630 --> 36:43.361
We'll start with the church, we're
hoping they can tell us if he's adopted.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.767
Thank you, Mr. Stone.
Thank you, Maggie.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.896
You're welcome.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.172
We're citizens...

36:54.946 --> 36:56.311
The church. That's it.

36:56.847 --> 36:58.747
Blanca! Wait!

37:02.954 --> 37:07.118
This is a list of churches in Roseville,
a town outside Sacramento,

37:07.225 --> 37:09.250
there's one called St. Anthony's.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.852
Now, there's a boys' choir there,
about 30 kids.

37:11.929 --> 37:15.990
Their vestments are red and white.
You might want to start there.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.495
- Why do you say that?
- It's a very long story.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.869
But just trust me on this one, OK?

37:24.809 --> 37:26.572
Gracias.

37:34.819 --> 37:36.582
Did you lose your other case yet?

37:36.654 --> 37:38.588
Lost part, won part, actually.

37:38.656 --> 37:43.423
But, it did make me realize that
I can't take on Solinsky right now.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.824
So we're back to tilting
at windmills again. Is that it?

37:48.899 --> 37:50.867
I just think the...

37:50.968 --> 37:53.459
...the way I play the game,

37:53.537 --> 37:56.768
the legal game, has got to change.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.338
Change. How?

38:01.412 --> 38:06.281
Well, for one thing, I can't spend all
my time trying cases like Solinsky.

38:06.350 --> 38:09.285
Supreme Court-bound cases
of national notoriety?

38:09.353 --> 38:12.379
I can't spend 70 hours a week
making rich people richer.

38:12.456 --> 38:16.620
I need to stay free and open and...

38:18.496 --> 38:21.522
...like a tree in the wind
and all that Eastern stuff.

38:21.599 --> 38:26.332
Like a tree in the wind. I'm sure you
think me a cold businessman, Eli.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.497
A senior partner who's only interested

38:28.572 --> 38:31.336
in the billable hours of one
of his senior associates.

38:31.409 --> 38:34.901
But, my "investment" in you

38:35.513 --> 38:39.381
hasn't been financial. I'm not
talking about my daughter. I hired you.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.419
I mentored you
before you even met Taylor.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.884
I didn't assign you Solinsky

38:45.956 --> 38:49.119
because you got the better
of Matt Dowd in a staff meeting.

38:49.226 --> 38:50.989
I assigned you that case

38:51.095 --> 38:55.259
because I've always thought
you were the future of this firm.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.700
My firm, that I've spent over
30 years building.

38:59.470 --> 39:03.167
And I thought that's what
you wanted, too.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.937
I did, but...

39:09.413 --> 39:11.074
OK, then. I respect that.

39:12.950 --> 39:17.319
Personally, I'm curious to see
how you adjust to your new lifestyle.

39:18.622 --> 39:20.249
I'm not sure I follow, sir.

39:20.324 --> 39:24.556
Well, Don Quixote gave up
nearly all his land

39:24.628 --> 39:27.290
so he could afford
his books on chivalry.

39:28.299 --> 39:31.735
I'm wondering, Eli,
what will you give up?

39:33.938 --> 39:35.565
Good night.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.614
- Good night, Patti.
- Night.

39:47.952 --> 39:50.216
- We're OK, right?
- I'm OK.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.255
You have a hole in your head.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.757
Yeah, let's keep that
between ourselves, OK?

39:55.659 --> 39:57.593
It's not Christmas.

40:03.434 --> 40:05.527
Do I have you to thank for this?

40:05.603 --> 40:08.470
This is Kali.
The Hindu goddess of annihilation.

40:08.539 --> 40:11.565
The Hindus don't have
a goddess of malpractice.

40:12.076 --> 40:15.603
Don't worry, the next time
we get you into court, you'll do better.

40:16.147 --> 40:20.311
- There's gonna be a next time?
- If you don't mind working with a jerk.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.257
I had to leave my coffee can in India.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.560
The can had sentimental value,
but I couldn't get it through customs.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.397
Why are you telling me this?

40:36.434 --> 40:40.996
I'm trying to tell you things...
start telling you things.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.936
The other night,
I saw a choir by the couch.

40:47.011 --> 40:51.107
A boys' choir, but I don't think
that's relevant and...

40:51.182 --> 40:53.650
...I tackled your dad because

40:53.717 --> 40:55.947
I was getting chased by a biplane.

40:57.755 --> 40:59.245
This is...

41:01.759 --> 41:03.784
It's a lot like your dad.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.932
That couldn't have been easy
to tell me that.

41:18.943 --> 41:24.245
- What? What are you looking at?
- Just a certain yak hoof candle.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.011
Apparently it's supposed to be
an aphrodisiac.

41:37.628 --> 41:40.791
- What is it?
- Uh... There's gunfire.

41:42.766 --> 41:45.929
- But no singing?
- Uh... Nope.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.205
So this is progress.
