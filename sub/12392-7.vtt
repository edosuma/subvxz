(Henry)
SHAWN?
SHAWN?

00:04.510 --> 00:06.330
GET IN HERE A SECOND.

00:08.750 --> 00:09.648
GUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:09.680 --> 00:12.547
I'M REPRESENTING SHAWN
IN THIS SITUATION.

00:12.590 --> 00:15.024
SHAWN!
GET IN HERE.

00:21.470 --> 00:23.677
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.349
WELL, WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

00:26.380 --> 00:27.779
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.151
I TOOK SOMETHING OF YOURS.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.748
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.451
DAD, YOU ROBBED ME?

00:32.490 --> 00:33.525
NO, ROBBERY'S THE TAKING
OF PROPERTY

00:33.560 --> 00:34.720
BY FORCE OR FEAR.

00:34.770 --> 00:36.362
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE
IN THIS ROOM.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.334
SO YOU'RE A BURGLAR THEN?

00:38.370 --> 00:40.179
NO, GUS.
BURGLARY INVOLVES BREAKING IN.

00:40.210 --> 00:41.541
THIS IS THEFT,

00:41.580 --> 00:43.218
PURE AND SIMPLE.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.649
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS

00:44.690 --> 00:47.158
OR YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT BACK.

00:47.190 --> 00:48.179
CONCENTRATE.

01:07.660 --> 01:08.763
YOU THIEF!

01:08.800 --> 01:09.937
YOU STOLE MY BB GUN.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.858
TECHNICALLY, YES,
THEFT MAKES ME A THIEF.

01:11.910 --> 01:12.934
YOU'RE LEARNING.

01:12.970 --> 01:14.540
SO CAN I HAVE IT BACK NOW?

01:14.580 --> 01:16.377
NO.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.183
I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY WITH IT
IN THE YARD.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.687
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.280
BUT YOU SAID IF I FIGURED OUT
WHAT WAS MISSING, I--

01:22.330 --> 01:23.922
SHAWN, THIEVES ALWAYS LIE.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.188
REMEMBER THAT.

01:25.230 --> 01:26.390
HOW'D YOU EVEN KNOW

01:26.440 --> 01:27.589
I WAS PLAYING WITH IT
IN THE BACKYARD?

01:53.050 --> 01:54.756
[grunts]

01:56.760 --> 01:58.660

02:17.870 --> 02:19.872
[indistinct police radio

02:22.980 --> 02:26.313
MR. COBURN, WE ARE INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL US.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.659
THEY WERE BIG AND SCARY,
THESE GUYS.

02:29.690 --> 02:31.499
DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM?

02:33.100 --> 02:34.408
THAT'S...RIGHT.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.998
OF COURSE THEY WERE BIG
AND SCARY.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.337
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
THE MAN'S LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.404
CARLTON,

02:40.150 --> 02:41.708
(Juliet)
WHAT TIME DID YOU BEGIN
YOUR SHIFI'?

02:41.750 --> 02:43.718
(Coburn)
8:00.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.749
(Juliet)
ARE YOU THE ONLY WATCHMAN?

02:44.790 --> 02:46.052
(Coburn)
YEAH.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.853
(Juliet)
WOULD YOU MIND SHOWING ME

02:47.900 --> 02:49.026
WHERE YOU WERE STANDING
AT THE TIME OF THE ATI'ACK?

02:49.070 --> 02:51.538
YEAH.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.106
I WAS WALKING THROUGH HERE.

03:02.430 --> 03:04.625
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?

03:04.660 --> 03:07.697
RIGHT NOW I'M PUTTING MY HAND
IN MY POCKET, SANS THUMB,

03:07.740 --> 03:09.059
POINTING AT AN IMAGINARY
SEAGULL.

03:09.110 --> 03:10.407
BUT EARLIER I GOT A CALL

03:10.440 --> 03:11.976
FROM THE CHIEF.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.614
SHE SOUNDED SERIOUS.

03:13.650 --> 03:14.969
THIRD BREAK-IN OF ITS KIND
IN AS MANY MONTHS.

03:15.020 --> 03:15.987
NO LEADS.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.112
CHIEF TOLD YOU THAT?

03:17.160 --> 03:19.424
NO, SHE DID.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.496
SHE LOOKS LIKE
THE VENUS DE MILO,

03:21.530 --> 03:23.760
BUT SHE PREFERS TO BE CALLED
TRACI WITH AN "I."

03:23.800 --> 03:25.529
SHE SAW EVERYTHING.

03:25.570 --> 03:26.639
SAID I SHOULD CHECK
THE VIDEOS

03:26.680 --> 03:27.908
IN THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.077
THE MANNEQUIN TOLD YOU THAT?

03:29.110 --> 03:29.940
NO, CHIEF DID.

03:29.980 --> 03:33.814
COME ON, LASSIE,
KEEP UP WITH ME HERE.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.452
GUS, I NEED YOU PAYING
ATTENTION.

03:35.490 --> 03:37.094
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

03:37.130 --> 03:39.462
I ONLY OPENED MY BOOK
FOR A SECOND, SHAWN.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.036
YOU KNOW I HAVE TO STUDY
FOR MY EXAM.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.059
RIGHT.

03:42.110 --> 03:44.032
THE RX...SOMETHING.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.139

03:46.180 --> 03:48.683
PHARMACEUTICAL REP
RE-CERTIFICATION EXAM.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.780
THAT IS THE SECOND WORST NAME
FOR A TEST EVER,

03:51.830 --> 03:53.957
RIGHT AFTER THE PROCTOLOGICAL
PRACTICUM.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.228
WELL, MY JOB DEPENDS ON IT

03:55.270 --> 03:56.760
AND YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.937
I'M NOT SURE HOW I CAN.

03:57.970 --> 03:58.766
YOU KEEP SUCH SLOPPY NOTES.

03:58.810 --> 04:00.471
WHAT IS THIS GREEN SLIME
ON YOUR BOOK?

04:00.480 --> 04:02.141
DID YOU JUST COME
FROM THE KIDS' CHOICE AWARDS?

04:02.180 --> 04:03.147
PSH, THIS PLACE IS FILTHY.

04:03.180 --> 04:04.147
MAYBE IT'S A CLUE.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.147
MAYBE IT'S URINE.
SMELL IT.

04:05.190 --> 04:06.145
I'M NOT GONNA SMELL IT.

04:06.190 --> 04:07.259
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME
OR NOT?

04:07.290 --> 04:10.919
WE'VE NEVER HAD MORE
THAN TWO PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.019
IT'S COZY,
WHICH MEANS I'LL NEED

04:13.070 --> 04:14.537
EVERYONE'S HANDS WHERE
I CAN SEE THEM.

04:14.570 --> 04:16.037
THAT MEANS YOURS, TOO,
CHIEF.

04:16.070 --> 04:17.571
WHO'S THIS?

04:17.610 --> 04:19.009
THAT'S OUR PSYCHIC,
SHAWN SPENCER.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.608
PSYCHIC, AND TREASURER

04:20.650 --> 04:22.140
OF THE AMERICAN WICKER COUNCIL.

04:22.190 --> 04:23.248
I'M UP FOR RE-ELECTION.

04:23.290 --> 04:24.757
I'M RUNNING
ON A RA'ITAN PLATFORM.

04:24.790 --> 04:25.825
STUART.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.589
THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOSTER,
DETECTIVE CARLTON LASS--

04:27.630 --> 04:30.224
WOULD YOU JUST PLAY
THE TAPE?

04:35.280 --> 04:36.872
THAT'S A LARIAT MOVE.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.842
THESE GUYS ARE EX-MILITARY.

04:38.890 --> 04:41.085
NO QUESTION.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.156
[crashing sound]

04:47.240 --> 04:49.731
OH, AND THAT ONE THERE
IS CALLING THE SHOTS,

04:49.780 --> 04:51.645
SO THERE APPEARS TO BE
A PA'ITERN HERE.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.238
[glass shatters]

04:53.280 --> 04:55.043
WELL, DETECT IVES,

04:55.090 --> 04:56.148
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING,

04:56.190 --> 05:00.229
YOU COULD FIND ME
IN MY OFFICE.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.922
OW.
HEY, CHIEF.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.714
ALL RIGHT, WE DEFINITELY NEED
TO CHECK OUT

05:10.750 --> 05:12.012

05:16.360 --> 05:17.998
HUH?

05:18.030 --> 05:19.895
OH, THEY'RE WOMEN.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.298
IT CAN'T BE WOMEN.

05:23.340 --> 05:25.274
THIS KIND OF THING
TOOK SOME KIND OF MUSCLE.

05:25.310 --> 05:27.175
IT'S A LITTLE SHOCKING,
ISN'T IT?

05:27.220 --> 05:29.882
NOT AS SHOCKING AS THIS:
THESE ARE 31$

05:29.920 --> 05:31.387
AND THEY'RE REALLY PULLING
THROUGH HERE.

05:31.420 --> 05:32.682
MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.357
GET ME THE 325.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.219
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.090
EITHER YOU HAVE SOMETHING
OR YOU DON'T.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.315
GOT IT.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.315
LET'S GO SEE THE CHIEF.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.725
YOU GOT IT?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.193
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I'VE GOT SUSPECT S.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.219
GOOD.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.225
LET'S GO AND GIVE THEM
THE NAMES.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.294
I GOT STUDYING TO DO.

05:54.340 --> 05:55.432
HOW MANY SUSPECT S
ARE WE TALKING?

05:55.470 --> 05:57.006
EH, GIVE OR TAKE--

05:57.040 --> 05:58.940
[alarm ringing]

05:58.980 --> 06:00.379
8O SUSPECT S?

06:00.420 --> 06:02.388
REALLY, MR. SPENCER.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.183
IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE

06:04.220 --> 06:06.279
PERHAPS TO NARROW IT DOWN
JUST A BIT, WOULD IT?

06:06.330 --> 06:07.422
NOT WITHOUT HELP.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.449
IT'S A TIGHT GROUP, CHIEF.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.819
IT'S A CLIQUE.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.428
IT'S A SISTERHOOD
OF THE YA-YA VARIETY,

06:11.470 --> 06:13.267
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT MORE THAN A SMILE

06:13.310 --> 06:15.039
AND A PACK OF PALL MALLS
TO GET 'EM TO TALK.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.104
NOT A PROBLEM.

06:16.150 --> 06:18.072
TOUGH-TO-CRACK SUSPECT S
ARE RIGHT IN MY WHEEL HOUSE.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.883
NEGATIVE,
WE CANNOT GO ABOUT THIS

06:19.920 --> 06:22.150
USING A TYPICAL
LASSITARIAN TECHNIQUE.

06:22.190 --> 06:25.489
WE NEED SOMEONE...
ON THE INSIDE.

06:25.530 --> 06:28.909
ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT
TO GO UNDERCOVER?

06:28.940 --> 06:31.238
UNDERCOVER? YES.
ME? NO.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.113
UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT QUALIFIED
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.

06:34.150 --> 06:35.447
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SPENCER.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.855
I'VE BEEN ITCHING
TO DO SOME UNDERCOVER WORK

06:36.890 --> 06:40.087
AND I'VE GOT
A NEW MOUSTACHE GUY.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.529

I LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD'S AT,

06:41.570 --> 06:42.468
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO TAKE

06:42.500 --> 06:44.491
A VERY SPECIFIC SKILL SET.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.428
THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THIS ROOM

06:46.480 --> 06:48.402
THAT CAN PULL IT OFF.

06:48.450 --> 06:52.489
I'VE JUST GOT ONE QUESTION.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.511
CAN YOU SKATE?

06:54.560 --> 06:57.552
(announcer)
AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE'RE
IN FOR AN EXCRUCIATING JAM

06:57.600 --> 07:00.831
AS MANIAC CUTS THROUGH THE PACK
LIKE A MACHETE.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.479
THAT DEFENSE HAD BE'ITER
GET ON THE DEFENSIVE OR ELSE.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.579

IS ABOUT TO BECOME

07:37.040 --> 07:39.144
THE GARDEN OF BEATIN'!

07:39.180 --> 07:44.379
AND IT'S MISS ANTHROPY
AROUND THE OUTSIDE.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.490

DON'T LET HER THROUGH!
DON'T LET HER THROUGH!

07:46.530 --> 07:47.622

I COULDN'T HAVE CALLED
A BETTER ASSIGNMENT.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.402

YEAH, RIGHT.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.577
YOU'RE A ROCKET SCIENTIST.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.009
I THOUGHT THE POLICE
HAD A SUSPECT

07:56.050 --> 07:58.177
FROM THE ROLLER DERBY,
LIKE, A MONTH AGO.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.244
SEVEN--SEVEN--

07:59.290 --> 08:00.518
SEVEN DEADLY CINDERELLA.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.050
YEAH,
BUT IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.159
WHAT DID YOU FIND

08:03.190 --> 08:05.192
THAT GOT CHIEF VICK BACK
ONTO THIS ROLLER DERBY ANGLE?

08:05.230 --> 08:07.369
OH, JUST EVERYTHING.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.233
DAMAGE, THE HAND SIGNALS.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.338
THE SCUFF MARKS ON THE FLOOR

08:11.380 --> 08:12.540
WERE CAUSED BY 62-MILLIMETER

08:12.580 --> 08:16.311

COMPETITION SKATE WHEELS.

08:16.350 --> 08:17.419
VICK WOULDN'T BUY IT

08:17.460 --> 08:19.325
UNTIL I THREW
IN SOME ROLLER BABBLE.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.122
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.196
WHO BE'ITER
FOR A SMASH AND GRAB JOB

08:22.230 --> 08:24.266
THAN AN ORGANIZED TEAM?

08:24.300 --> 08:26.109
YOU THINK THEY WERE ALL
ON WHEELS?

08:26.140 --> 08:28.404
(Shawn)
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM WAS.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.169
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
IT WAS ONE OF THESE TEAMS?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.314
GUS, YOU WANT TO TAKE
THIS ONE?

08:32.350 --> 08:33.442
WHAT?

08:33.490 --> 08:35.082
CHECK THE SCHEDULE.

08:35.130 --> 08:36.222
THESE WERE THE ONLY TWO TEAMS

08:36.260 --> 08:38.353
WHO WERE OFF ON ALL THE NIGHTS
THE BREAK-INS OCCURRED.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.061
WE CALL THAT DETECTIVE WORK.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.089
IT'S A RARE AND BEAUTIFUL
THING.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.698
LIKE CLUBBED THUMBS.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.799

I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS CASE.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.774
THESE WOMEN SCARE ME.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.447
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S A CAKE ASSIGNMENT.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.344
I USED TO DO SOME SECURITY WORK

08:49.390 --> 08:51.312
FOR THE ROLLER DERBY
BACK IN THE DAY.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.224
THOSE BROADS,

08:52.260 --> 08:53.488
THEY KNEW HOW TO GET
THE JOB DONE.

08:53.530 --> 08:54.497
THIS IS--I DON'T KNOW.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.122
THIS IS LIKE A FASHION SHOW.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.592
THESE BROADS,
THEY CAN'T--THEY DON'T HIT.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.198
AND THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT YOU
DOWN HERE, POP.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.071
TO HEAR YOU SAY "BROADS"
REPEATEDLY.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.446
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN TO US
HOW ALL THIS WORKS.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.708
(Henry)
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
DO YOU SEE THE ONE

09:04.750 --> 09:05.717
WITH THE STAR ON HER HELMET?

09:05.750 --> 09:06.717
SHE'S THE LEAD JAMMER.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.217
SHE SCORES POINTS

09:08.260 --> 09:10.285
WHEN SHE PASSES
THE OPPOSING SKATERS.

09:10.330 --> 09:11.422
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK AT HER, RIGHT THERE.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.360
THE ONE THEY CALL FOX--
SEE, SHE'S REACHING DOWN.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.163
SHE'S UP TO SOMETHING.
SEE THAT PIECE OF TAPE?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.202
NUMBER 13.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.400
SHE'S BEEN MARKED.
SHE'S GONNA GET HIT.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.304
SHE'S GONNA BE TAKEN DOWN.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.817
WATCH THIS.
WATCH IT. HERE IT GOES.

09:20.850 --> 09:23.182
[groans]

09:23.220 --> 09:26.348
OH, AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
FOR THE SUICIDE SEATS!

09:26.390 --> 09:27.220
WHOO!

09:27.260 --> 09:28.420
(announcer)
AND IT'S HAPPY TIMES

09:28.460 --> 09:33.602
FOR WESTWOOD, WILDE, AND
CAPTAIN DENISE "KAMIKAZE" FOX.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.404
THIS IS OUR ONLY CHANCE
TO SNOOP AROUND, GUS.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.542
LET'S GO.

09:37.580 --> 09:38.444
DAD, YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:38.480 --> 09:39.549
HIT HER!

09:39.590 --> 09:41.182
NO, HIT HER NOW!
SHE'S DOWN!

09:41.220 --> 09:42.551
HE'S FINE.

09:42.590 --> 09:43.557
WOULD YOU--

09:43.590 --> 09:44.557
HIT!

09:44.600 --> 09:45.726
WHAT ARE WE DOING,
SHAWN?

09:45.770 --> 09:48.261
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

09:48.300 --> 09:50.609
WE'RE BOTH GROWING MOUSTACHES
VERY, VERY SLOWLY,

09:50.640 --> 09:52.505
BUT WE'RE ALSO INVESTIGATING.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.847
THIS IS
JULIET'S INVESTIGATION.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.245
WE'RE GONNA BLOW HER COVER.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.541
WE NEED TO STAY
OUT OF HER WAY.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.911
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, GUS.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.484
OR WE DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.862
I VOTE FOR NUMBER TWO.

10:05.040 --> 10:05.904
BE MY LOOKOUT.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.771
NO, THERE'S ONLY
A FEW MINUTES LEFT, SHAWN,

10:07.810 --> 10:09.471
AND YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE--

10:31.990 --> 10:33.480
[glass shatters]

10:45.580 --> 10:47.684
[door Opens]

10:57.080 --> 10:58.775
[door shuts]

11:18.180 --> 11:20.045
WORST LOOKOUT EVER.

11:20.090 --> 11:21.682
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE GIRL
WALK IN?

11:21.730 --> 11:24.597
AND I ROUND THIS CORNER,
AND THERE'S MANIAC.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.393
AND I'M, LIKE,
"WHERE'D SHE GO?"

11:26.430 --> 11:28.591
AND SHE'S, LIKE,
"WHERE'D WHO GO?"

11:28.640 --> 11:29.732
SHE MOVES PRE'ITY GOOD
FOR FRESH MEAT.

11:29.770 --> 11:30.976
THAT'S TOTALLY A COM PLIMENT.

11:31.010 --> 11:32.443
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO SKATE LIKE THAT?

11:32.480 --> 11:35.813
OH, YOU KNOW,
COLLEGE ROLLER-SKATE TEAM.

11:35.850 --> 11:38.751
AND XANADU.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.758
[laughs]

11:40.800 --> 11:41.721
THAT'S FUNNY.
I GET IT.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.897
YEAH.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.467
[giggIeSI

11:48.840 --> 11:50.774
(Gus)
DUDE, YOU ARE LEERING.

11:50.820 --> 11:53.516
AND IF BY LEERING,
YOU MEAN

11:53.550 --> 11:54.915
STARING ODDLY
IN A CREEPY WAY,

11:54.960 --> 11:57.758
YES, BUT IT'S
FOR AN INVESTIGATION, GUS.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.688
THEY'RE ALL SCRAPED UP

11:59.730 --> 12:01.061
FROM BURGLARIZING.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.136
BU RGLARIZATION?
BU RG LARISM.

12:03.170 --> 12:04.637
OF COURSE THEY'RE SCRAPED UP.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.704
IT'S A FULL CONTACT SPORT.

12:05.750 --> 12:06.842
(Shawn)
UH-HUH.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.471
SINCE WHEN DO WE GET INJURIES

12:07.520 --> 12:09.715
UNDERNEATH OUR ELBOW PADS.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.717
AND THAT'S A GLASS CUT
ON THE OTHER ONE.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.728
CHECK IT OUT.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.763
THAT'S LEERING.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.674
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

12:22.710 --> 12:24.075
I'M MOVING ON THIS CASE.

12:24.110 --> 12:24.974
I'M PRE'ITY SURE I FOUND

12:25.020 --> 12:26.817
THE EXTRA SENSORY VORTEX
IN THIS BUILDING.

12:26.860 --> 12:27.781
WHERE?
WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM.

12:27.820 --> 12:28.684
WHICH, AS IT HAPPENS,

12:28.720 --> 12:29.880
IS A PLACE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO HANG OUT,

12:29.930 --> 12:30.680
SO IT'S TOTALLY A WIN-WIN.

12:30.730 --> 12:32.288
SHAWN, I GET THIS
IS HOW YOU WORK.

12:32.330 --> 12:34.639
BUT THIS IS NOT HOW WE ARE GOING
TO BE DOING THINGS.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.739
I AM LEAD DETECTIVE,

12:35.770 --> 12:36.771
AND THIS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST

12:36.810 --> 12:37.606
A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.971
SO IF WE ARE GOING
TO BE PARTNERS,

12:39.010 --> 12:40.819
WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING THINGS
MY WAY.

12:40.850 --> 12:42.010
ALL KIDDING ASIDE,

12:42.050 --> 12:43.586
I GOT SOME SERIOUS VIBES
IN THERE.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.655
AND POSSIBLY ATHLETE'S FOOT.

12:44.690 --> 12:45.657
GREAT,
I'LL CHECK IT OUT

12:45.690 --> 12:46.759
AND COME BY
YOUR OFFICE LATER,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.199
BUT RIGHT NOW I NEED YOU GUYS
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

12:48.230 --> 12:51.893
IS THIS GUY BOTHERING YOU,
MANIAC?

12:51.940 --> 12:53.737
WILDE, FOX, THIS IS--

12:53.770 --> 12:56.876
I KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.049
WE SEE GAWKERS LIKE HIM
ALL THE TIME AROUND HERE.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.217
REALLY EASY TO SPOT.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.854
THERE'S ALWAYS ONE THING OFF
ABOUT THEM.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.925
CLOTH ES, HAIR,

13:05.970 --> 13:07.369
TEETH.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.061
YOU JUST NAMED
MY THREE BEST FEATURES.

13:09.110 --> 13:10.759
FOURTH ON THE LIST,

13:10.810 --> 13:11.777
POSTU RE.

13:11.810 --> 13:13.846
FIFTH, ELOCUTION.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.949
MANIACMANIAC19,

13:14.980 --> 13:16.186
PRESIDENT PRO-TEM,

13:16.220 --> 13:19.280
MANIAC FAN CLUB.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.298
THIS IS MY VICE PRESIDENT,
LONGBRANCH PENNYWHISTLE.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.719
I'M JUST LOOKING TO SCORE
A LITTLE FACE TIME

13:23.770 --> 13:24.737
WITH THE MANIAC HERE,
YOU KNOW,

13:24.770 --> 13:25.998
FOR THE BLOG.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.304
689 HITS AND CLIMBING.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.376
NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.014
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE 'EM
AN INTERVIEW.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.847
IT WAS ONLY GONNA BE
TWO WORDS.

13:33.890 --> 13:35.881
OH!
[laughs]

13:35.930 --> 13:37.852
[chuckles]

13:37.900 --> 13:39.390
OKAY, COME ON.

13:39.430 --> 13:41.193
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.367
BRING THE OUTFIT.
ONE OF US MIGHT WEAR IT.

13:43.410 --> 13:45.401
GET LOST!

13:55.970 --> 13:56.937
O'HARA,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.790
MIGHT I HAVE A WORD

13:58.840 --> 13:59.909
IN MY OFFICE?

14:06.320 --> 14:08.754
OH, SORRY, CHIEF.

14:08.790 --> 14:10.121
I HAVE TO BREAK
THESE THINGS IN,

14:10.160 --> 14:12.025
AND YOU KNOW
HOW MY FAMILY IS CURSED

14:12.070 --> 14:13.219
WITH BAD ARCHES, RIGHT?

14:13.270 --> 14:14.498
PLEASE TAKE THEM OFF.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.007
I WAS JUST GONNA
SUGGEST THAT.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.769
LATER.

14:19.540 --> 14:22.111
DID YOU BREAK
SOMEBODY'S NOSE?

14:22.150 --> 14:24.516
YES, I DID.
THANK YOU.

14:24.550 --> 14:26.984
OH, BUT IT WAS A CLEAN HIT.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.429
IT WAS ACTUALLY
MORE OF A DISLOCATION.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.018
YOU KNOW, IT JUST POPPED
RIGHT BACK IN.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.765
YEAH, SHE CURLED
INTO MY WINGSPAN,

14:31.800 --> 14:34.064
SO I WAS TOTALLY JUSTIFIED.

14:34.110 --> 14:35.532
WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.013
SHE HAS A CAT.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.211
I'M CONCERNED
FOR YOUR SAFETY

14:39.250 --> 14:40.808
AND THAT THIS
MIGHT BE A MISTAKE.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.556
NO, NO, NO.
IT IS NOT A MISTAKE.

14:43.590 --> 14:45.319
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY SMART CALL.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.533
I HAVE FOUND A SCAD
OF PRIORS ON MY SUSPECT S.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.299
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT,
BA'ITERY.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.831
OH! AND RECKLESS
EN DANGERM ENT.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.144
SO YOU'RE SAYING PU'ITING YOU
IN DANGER IS A BONUS?

14:54.180 --> 14:56.319
I'M TELLING YOU
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

14:56.350 --> 14:58.250
I DIDN'T WANT

14:58.290 --> 14:59.826
TO DO THIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

14:59.860 --> 15:01.521
AND I'LL BE CANDID,
O'HARA.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.164
YOU TEND TO DIVE IN
A LITTLE TOO DEEPLY

15:03.200 --> 15:04.599
WHEN YOU GO UNDERCOVER.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.835
LOOK, CHIEF, FIRST OFF,

15:06.870 --> 15:08.838
ROLLER DERBY
IS BETTER THAN THERAPY--

15:08.880 --> 15:10.609
IF I WERE INTO
THAT SORT OF THING.

15:10.650 --> 15:13.539
AND SECONDLY, THESE GIRLS,
THEY'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.

15:13.590 --> 15:15.558
MOST OF THEM ARE PAYING
OUT OF POCKET,

15:15.590 --> 15:16.852
AND THEY ARE
ALL THE RIGHT ELEMENT

15:16.890 --> 15:17.993
FOR THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

15:18.030 --> 15:20.897
HUNCHES AND PROFILES ARE NOT
GONNA KEEP THIS THING GOING.

15:20.940 --> 15:24.876
I NEED CONCRETE PROOF
SOON.

15:26.910 --> 15:28.309
FROM THAT SECURITY VIDEO.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.238
DONE.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.591
OH, UM, THIS A TYPO, RIGHT?

15:35.630 --> 15:37.393
$800 FOR SKATES?

15:37.440 --> 15:39.067
WOULD IT HELP
IF I TOLD YOU

15:39.100 --> 15:40.567
THE OTHER PAIRS
WEREN'T CUTE AT ALL?

15:40.610 --> 15:44.171
GET ME RESULTS.
HURRY.

15:46.490 --> 15:51.655
[phone rings]

15:51.700 --> 15:54.669
YEAH.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.634
THIS IS MANIAC.

15:56.670 --> 15:59.446
OH, YEAH.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.914
TONIGHT?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.651
YEAH, I CAN KEEP IT QUIET.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.555
OKAY.

16:07.590 --> 16:09.524
I'LL BE THERE.

16:12.340 --> 16:16.379
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.310
[whispers]
OH, MY GOD.

16:18.350 --> 16:20.011
IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE?
ARE YOU ON A DATE?

16:20.050 --> 16:21.017
NO.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.209
[scoffs]
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:22.260 --> 16:23.625
I JUST, UH,

16:23.660 --> 16:24.627
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU'D BE HUNGRY,

16:24.660 --> 16:26.696
SO I JUST, I THREW SOMETHING
TOGETHER QUICKLY.

16:26.730 --> 16:29.506
UH, LOOK, WE GO'ITA GET
RIGHT TO THIS.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.030
I WAS JUST AT THE STATION

16:31.080 --> 16:32.502
AND I REALLY THINK
I AM ON TO SOMETHING.

16:32.550 --> 16:34.017
THAT'S GREAT.

16:34.050 --> 16:35.039
WE HAVE ALL NIGHT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.081
GEWURZTRAMIN ER?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.610
YES--NO!
NO, NO, NO.

16:37.660 --> 16:38.786
I CAN'T STAY.

16:38.820 --> 16:39.787
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM ONE OF THE GIRLS.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.026
ARE THOSE CRAB CAKES?

16:41.060 --> 16:42.095
YES, THEY ARE.

16:42.130 --> 16:44.769
WITH DILL AND CORIANDER.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.028
WHICH GIRL
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

16:46.070 --> 16:48.334
THEY CALL HER TOXIC WASTE,

16:48.380 --> 16:49.733
BUT HER NAME IS SHELLY.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.145
SAID SHE WAS TALKING TO SOME
OF THE OTHER GIRLS

16:51.180 --> 16:53.387
AND THAT THEY
WERE VERY IMPRESSED BY ME

16:53.420 --> 16:55.411
AND THAT I AM PERFECT
FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE

16:55.460 --> 16:56.688
GOING ON DOWNTOWN TONIGHT.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.357
A MONEY-MAKING OPPORTUNITY.

17:04.310 --> 17:07.108
JULES, DON'T GO.

17:07.150 --> 17:09.118
SHAWN, I RAN SOME
OF THEIR NAMES.

17:09.150 --> 17:10.185
THEY HAVE RECORDS.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.188
I'VE ALREADY ELIMINATED
TOXIC WASTE.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.380
SHE WASN'T AT THE BREAK-IN.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.295
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

17:15.330 --> 17:16.422
I AM UNDERCOVER RIGHT NOW,

17:16.470 --> 17:18.859
AND THINGS CAN GET
REAL STICKY, REAL FAST.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.561
STICKY HOW?
SHAWN.

17:20.610 --> 17:21.702
JULES, LISTEN.

17:21.740 --> 17:22.832
THIS THING THAT'S HAPPENING
TONIGHT,

17:22.880 --> 17:23.642
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK
IT IS.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.183
NOW, SIT DOWN,
HAVE SOME ENDIVES.

17:26.220 --> 17:27.847
SHAWN, ARE WE WORKING TOGETHER
OR NOT?

17:27.890 --> 17:29.881
YES, TECHNICALLY WE'RE WORKING
TOGETHER ON THIS CASE,

17:29.920 --> 17:30.921
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, JULES?

17:30.960 --> 17:32.689
I'M NOT FEELING PARTICULARLY
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

17:32.730 --> 17:33.867
THEN SUPPORT ME.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.630
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK
I AM ON TO SOMETHING.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.376
NOW, I GO'ITA GO AND YOU'RE
EITHER IN OR YOU'RE OUT.

17:54.210 --> 17:56.269
OKAY, NORTH EXIT,
SOUTH EXIT.

17:56.310 --> 17:58.540
NOBODY GETS OUT.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.719
JULES, YOU DO REALIZE
WE'RE OUTSIDE OF A WAREHOUSE.

18:00.750 --> 18:01.956
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, SHAWN.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.582
EVEN IF IT'S NOT A BURGLARY,

18:03.630 --> 18:06.190
IT'S VERY LIKELY SOME KIND
OF PERIPHERAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

18:06.230 --> 18:07.936
THIS PLACE ISN'T LIKE ANY
OF THE OTHERS.

18:07.970 --> 18:10.302
LOOK, I AM REALLY SORRY
I HAVE TO DO THIS TO YOU, BUT...

18:10.340 --> 18:12.399
CARLTON.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.805
JULES.

18:13.850 --> 18:15.511
SPENCER, YOU'RE IN THE WAY.

18:15.550 --> 18:17.654
GO.

18:17.690 --> 18:20.727
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA LET HER
GET IN HERE.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.364
AND ON HER SIGNAL,

18:22.400 --> 18:23.890
WE'RE GONNA
LIGHT THIS CANDLE.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.014
(director)
BRILLIANT! BEAUTIFUL!

18:33.050 --> 18:34.017
STAND DOWN.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.779
DO IT AGAIN!
RESET THE PLAYBACK, PLEASE.

18:35.820 --> 18:38.323
A MUSIC VIDEO SHOOT?

18:38.360 --> 18:39.998
I SENT NEARLY A DOZEN
UNIFORMED OFFICERS

18:40.030 --> 18:40.928
AND SIX BLACK AND WHITES

18:40.970 --> 18:43.404
AND NONE OF YOUR SUSPECTS
WERE EVEN THERE.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.668
NOW, I'M GONNA NEED
A PRE'ITY DAMN COMPELLING REASON

18:44.710 --> 18:45.631
NOT TO PULL THE PLUG

18:45.680 --> 18:47.739
ON THIS ONE, O'HARA,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

18:47.780 --> 18:48.974
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.885
IT WAS ME.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.057
I FELT A VIBE.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.682
I--I GOT A MESSAGE.

18:53.730 --> 18:54.754
YOU DID?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.961
YES.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.831
TURNS OUT IT WAS
A MAJOR METAPHYSICAL SNAFU.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.406
O'HARA SAID IT WAS
A NON-START.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.668
I THREW A TANTRUM.

19:01.710 --> 19:04.042
I WAS CRYING, KICKING,

19:04.080 --> 19:05.638
AND STAMPING MY LI'ITLE FEET.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.808
I MEAN,
THEY'RE NOT ABNORMALLY SMALL.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.623
O'HARA.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.627
LOOK, CHIEF,
I CAN GET RESULTS.

19:11.660 --> 19:12.661
LET ME IN ON THIS.

19:12.700 --> 19:13.689
SURE, CHIEF.

19:13.730 --> 19:15.664
LASSIE SEEMS LIKE
A SMART CHOICE.

19:15.700 --> 19:16.962
WE KNOW HE'S A DEMON
ON WHEELS,

19:17.010 --> 19:19.478
AND, OF COURSE, HE'S
SO VERY GOOD WITH WOMEN.

19:19.510 --> 19:20.477
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

19:20.510 --> 19:21.670
I MIGHT CONSIDER YOU,
CARLTON.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.439
BUT YOU'RE NEVER MORE OBVIOUS
THAN WHEN YOU'RE UNDERCOVER.

19:24.490 --> 19:25.718
PERHAPS YOU'VE FORGO'ITEN
THE PROSTHETIC NOSE DEBACLE

19:25.760 --> 19:28.024
OF 2005?

19:28.060 --> 19:29.322
HA.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.779
CHIEF, WE ARE DEFINITELY
ONTO SOMETHING.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.754
AND LAST NIGHT'S ROBBERY
FITS THE PA'ITERN WE'VE SEEN

19:43.790 --> 19:45.929
BETWEEN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
AND SPECIFIC TEAMS.

19:45.960 --> 19:46.995
WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO A FEW SUSPECTS.

19:47.030 --> 19:47.997
THREE SUSPECTS.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.167
TEAMMATES, FRIENDS, PEN PALS.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.609
SOLID SUSPECT S.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.849
MAYBE FOUR. POSSIBLY FIVE.
AH, SIX COULD--

19:55.880 --> 19:56.949
OH, MR. SPENCER.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.810
THE IDEA IS
TO HAVE FEWER SUSPECT S.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.725
YOU DON'T GET PAID
BY THE SUSPECT.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.467
I SEE US CLOSING THIS
BY TOMORROW.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.592
TOMORROW THEN.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.164
ABSOLUTELY.
FINE.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.737
BUT I'M GONNA NEED RESULTS
WITHOUT ANOTHER INCIDENT,

20:08.780 --> 20:11.647
METAPHYSICAL OR OTHERWISE.

20:11.680 --> 20:22.067
YOU'RE ALL DISMISSED.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.499
WOW, SHE REALLY UNLOADED
ON US.

20:23.540 --> 20:24.529
[sighs]

20:24.570 --> 20:26.549
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE HEAT
ON THAT ONE, SHAWN.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.548
JULES, THAT'S HOW IT GOES
WHEN YOU'RE PARTNERS.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.218
IF I COULD ONLY COUNT
THE NUMBER OF TIMES

20:30.250 --> 20:32.184
THAT GUS HAS LEFT MY CHEESE
IN THE WIND.

20:32.220 --> 20:33.255
WHAT?

20:33.290 --> 20:34.598
NOTHING.
STUDY ON, BUDDY.

20:34.630 --> 20:37.565
ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,
ROSACEA, CROUP.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.965
CROUP?
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO OWE ME ONE.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.903
OR...YOU CAN GIVE ME ONE
OF THESE BRACELETS.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.975
THEY COME IN TEAL?
CAN'T DO.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.159
CAN'T DO TEAL?
NO, WESTWOOD GAVE IT TO ME.

20:48.190 --> 20:49.282
IT'S A ROLLER DERBY THING.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.981
YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

20:51.030 --> 20:52.759
FINE, YOU CAN DIAL BACK
THE MANIAC ROUTINE.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.824
STOP PULLING RANK ON ME.

20:53.870 --> 20:54.825
OKAY.
ORDERING ME AROUND.

20:54.870 --> 20:55.837
FINE.

20:55.870 --> 20:57.132
AND SMOOTHIES ARE ON YOU

20:57.170 --> 20:58.273
UNTIL WE NAB SOMEONE.

20:58.310 --> 21:00.540
I WANT TO FIGURE OUT
THE NEXT STEP

21:00.580 --> 21:01.615
BY SEEING HOW YOU WORK.

21:01.650 --> 21:03.584
I WANT TO GET CLOSE
TO YOUR PROCESS.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.587
GET SOME HARD EVIDENCE.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.759
YEAH, SHAWN.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:06.790 --> 21:09.099
WHY DON'T YOU BRING HER
RIGHT IN ON YOUR PROCESS?

21:09.130 --> 21:11.064
JULES, HERE'S THE THING.
CLOSE IS GOOD.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.601
VERY CLOSE IS EVEN BE'ITER.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.005
BUT NOT FOR THIS.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.077
MY PROCESS IS NOT A TANDEM BIKE;
IT'S A UNICYCLE.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.044
YOU BELONG AT PRACTICE.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.048
I CAN SEE FOX.

21:21.090 --> 21:22.114
YOU GOTTA KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.787
THAT'S GONNA BE
REALLY DIFFICULT.

21:23.830 --> 21:26.151
SHE'S ALWAYS SURROUNDED
BY WESTWOOD AND WILDE.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.599
PERFECT.
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM TOO.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.672
THERE.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.611
THE LISTS FROM VICK'S DESK.

21:36.650 --> 21:39.084
AND THEY MAKE ABSOLUTELY
NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.849
WHY DON'T YOU TRY ARRANGING THEM
IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER?

21:40.890 --> 21:41.959
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, GUS.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.991
THEY STOLE A DVD OF SPANGLISH.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.634
CLEARLY, THEY WEREN'T AFTER
THE MERCHANDISE.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.729
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
HARD EVIDENCE, SHAWN.

21:47.780 --> 21:49.372
THANK YOU, PROFESSOR NO HELP.
WHAT?

21:49.410 --> 21:51.048
OH, I'M SORRY.
DID YOU MISS THAT?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.709
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE SAID
MC NO HELP OR DOCTOR DO-NOTHING

21:54.760 --> 21:56.057
BECAUSE YOU'RE BRINGING NOTHING
TO THE TABLE.

21:56.090 --> 21:58.354
I HAVE A TEST, REMEMBER?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.924
NO PASS, NO JOB.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.633
NO JOB, NO DRIVING YOU AROUND.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.039
BESIDES, YOU'RE DOING
PERFECT LY FINE

22:04.070 --> 22:05.037
WITH YOUR NEW PARTNER.

22:05.070 --> 22:06.378
[scoffs]
WHO? JULES?

22:06.410 --> 22:08.844
"WHO? JULES?"
WHO DO YOU THINK?

22:08.880 --> 22:10.040
DON'T BE JEALOUS.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.081
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.849
DON'T BE VEXED.

22:12.890 --> 22:14.187
YOU'RE STILL NUMBER ONE
ON MY MYSPACE PAGE.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.720
JULES AND I ARE JUST WORKING
A CASE TOGETHER.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.761
NOTHING MORE.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.372
WHAT IS THIS GREEN SLIME
ON YOUR BOOK?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.911
DID YOU JUST COME
FROM THE KID'S CHOICE AWARDS?

22:24.950 --> 22:25.939
THIS PLACE IS FILTHY.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.789
WILDE WAS THERE.

22:27.820 --> 22:28.479
WHAT?

22:28.520 --> 22:30.226
CYNTHIA "SPEED FREAK" WILDE

22:30.260 --> 22:32.228
WAS THERE AT ZILK'S
DURING THE BREAK-IN.

22:32.260 --> 22:37.061
SHE USES THIS GREEN OIL
TO LUBRICATE HER SKATES.

22:37.110 --> 22:38.429
LOOKS LIKE SHE LEFT SOME BEHIND.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.415
GOOD CLUE, BUDDY.

22:41.450 --> 22:43.509
SO YOU HAVE FOX WITH
THE BROKEN WATCH AND NOW WILDE.

22:43.550 --> 22:44.380
WHY DON'T YOU CALL THE COPS?

22:44.420 --> 22:45.819
ACCORDING TO THE TAPES
AT THE STORE,

22:45.860 --> 22:46.827
THERE WERE AT LEAST THREE MORE.

22:46.860 --> 22:47.792
IF WE DON'T GET ALL OF THEM,

22:47.830 --> 22:49.092
THEY'RE JUST GONNA KEEP DOING
THEIR THING.

22:49.130 --> 22:52.258
THAT IS THE OATH OF THIEVES,
GUS.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.905
THAT IS THE CODE
OF THE ROLLER GIRL.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.773
I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

22:57.820 --> 22:59.378
EVEN MORE THAN SINKHOLE
SISSY FEET

22:59.420 --> 23:02.059
FLAPJACK GO-GO BOOTS?

23:02.090 --> 23:04.251
JULIET ISN'T ANSWERING
HER PHONE.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.793
HM.

23:06.830 --> 23:08.536
YOU KNOW, THOSE CRAB CAKES ARE,
LIKE,

23:11.310 --> 23:13.449
(Fox)
OKAY, REMEMBER, MANIAC,

23:13.480 --> 23:15.471
THE KEY IS TO JUST GET THROUGH
THE PACK.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.589
JUST, GRR,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.281
WELL, WE DON'T WANT
TO INJURE ANYONE

23:18.320 --> 23:19.548
IN PRACTICE, DO WE?

23:19.590 --> 23:21.023
OF COURSE NOT.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.891
BUT IF SOMEONE'S SHOULDER
HAS TO GET DISLOCATED,

23:22.930 --> 23:25.990
WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
IT ISN'T YOURS.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.405
BACK TO IT, BOSS?

23:27.440 --> 23:28.976
WAIT, WHERE IS LETHAL WEAPON?

23:29.010 --> 23:30.102
OH, WESTWOOD?

23:30.140 --> 23:32.040
SHE HAD TO SPLIT
A SECOND AGO,

23:32.080 --> 23:34.082
GO VISIT HER MOTHER.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.553
LET'S GO KICK SOME ASS.

23:35.590 --> 23:36.579
COOL.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.520
I'M JUST GONNA GRAB SOMETHING.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.255
(Fox)
OKAY, SEE YOU ON THE TRACK.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.366
WESTWOOD,

23:43.410 --> 23:44.536
HEY.

23:44.570 --> 23:45.571
HEY.

23:45.610 --> 23:46.634
YOU LEAVING?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.079
YEAH.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.644
EVERYTHING OKAY?

23:49.680 --> 23:50.908
WELL, I HAVE TO GO MEET
MY BOYFRIEND.

23:50.950 --> 23:51.951
HE'S KINDA GOT

23:51.990 --> 23:54.151
CAR TROUBLE, SO...

23:54.190 --> 23:55.452
OH.
I HAVE TO GO.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.524
OH.

23:56.570 --> 23:57.525
YEAH, WELL, UH,

23:57.570 --> 24:00.038
HE'S KIND OF STRANDED
OUT ON THE MESA SOMEWHERE.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.901
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,

24:01.940 --> 24:02.872
WELL, MAKE SURE YOU BRING HIM
TO THE BOUT TOMORROW.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.247
YEAH, I'LL TRY,
YEAH.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.589
SEE YA LATER.

24:57.450 --> 25:01.352
[cell phone rings]

25:01.390 --> 25:02.994
JULES.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.560
SHAWN, I FOUND A COUPLE
OF HAND-HELD SCANNING MACHINES

25:05.600 --> 25:06.498
HERE AT THE HALL.

25:06.540 --> 25:08.804
YOU FEEL ANYTHING
ON SCANNING MACHINES?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.307
SCANNING MACHINES?

25:10.350 --> 25:11.669
YEAH, FOR MAKING COPIES.

25:11.710 --> 25:14.087
AH.
NO, NO.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.815
COPYING DEVICES
ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE

25:15.860 --> 25:17.157
PSYCHIC FE'ITERS.

25:17.190 --> 25:18.794
NOW, IF THEY WERE
THREE-HOLE PUNCHERS,

25:18.830 --> 25:20.297
DIFFERENT STORY.

25:20.330 --> 25:22.195
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA LOOK
AROUND SOME MORE,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.128
BUT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

25:24.170 --> 25:25.432
WESTWOOD LEFT PRACTICE
EARLY TODAY.

25:25.470 --> 25:28.542
SHE GAVE ME SOME LIE
AND THEN SHE JUST TOOK OFF.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.314
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

25:31.350 --> 25:33.159
I'M GE'ITING SOMETHING NOW.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.657
STREET CLOTHES, GREEN TANK TOP,
JEANS, BELT--

25:34.690 --> 25:37.124
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE BELT.

25:37.170 --> 25:37.795
DO YOU SEE HER?

25:37.830 --> 25:40.105
EN MI CABESA, JULES.

25:40.140 --> 25:41.801
[Shawn on phone]
I GOT A PSYCHIC TRACK
ON HER NOW.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.501
[horn buzzing]

25:43.550 --> 25:44.448
OKAY, I GO'ITA GO.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.368
CALL LASSITER
IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.682
OF COURSE.
I'LL CALL LASSITER.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.188
I'M NOT CALLING LASSITER.
[scoffs]

25:58.640 --> 26:00.403
FOLLOW THE BOUNCING
WESTWOOD.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.374
[engine starts]

26:19.780 --> 26:22.908
(Gus)
NOT TOO CLOSE.
SHE'S GONNA SEE US.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.534
DUDE, IS THAT--

26:30.570 --> 26:31.605
WHAT?

26:33.910 --> 26:35.719
I THINK THERE'S A BODY
IN THE BACK OF THAT TRUCK.

26:35.750 --> 26:36.819
[laughs]

26:36.850 --> 26:38.317
GUS, IT'S NOT A BODY.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.611
(Gus)
IT IS!
THAT'S A HEAD.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.924
DUDE, THIS TEST HAS GOT YOU
ALL JACKED UP.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.325
YOU'RE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.

26:43.370 --> 26:44.723
YOU'RE TOO DISTRACT ED
TRYING TO REMEMBER

26:44.770 --> 26:46.328
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LERMACIL AND HERMACIL.

26:46.370 --> 26:48.008
LERMACIL IS FOR FEVER BLISTERS.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.439
HERMACIL IS FOR ECZEMA.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.276
WHAT ABOUT CHERMACIL?

26:50.310 --> 26:52.312
NO SUCH THING AS CHERMACIL,
SHAWN.

26:52.350 --> 26:53.510
STU DYING.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.998
SWEET FANTASY ISLAND,
THAT IS A BODY!

27:01.030 --> 27:02.588
I TOLD YOU.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.231
NOT TOO CLOSE.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.403
GUS, WESTWOOD
IS DITCHING A BODY.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.475
THAT'S THE BREAK IN THE CASE
THAT WE NEED.

27:07.510 --> 27:09.444
WHAT WE NEED IS TO CALL LASSITER
LIKE JULIET SAID.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.742
AND BACK OFF A LITTLE.
SHE'S GONNA SEE US.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.018
WE'RE NOT CALLING LASSITER.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.789
YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

27:13.830 --> 27:14.854
I REALLY HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU EVERY SINGLE TIME?

27:14.890 --> 27:17.563
YOU JUST LOST WESTWOOD.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.692
DAMN IT!

27:28.720 --> 27:30.051
(Shawn)
BINGO.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.036
[engine starts]

27:57.750 --> 27:59.445
LET'S GO.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.380
I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE.

28:01.420 --> 28:02.682
DUDE, IT'S ONLY GONNA TAKE
A SECOND.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.722
YOU CANNOT SIT HERE ALONE
IN THE DARK

28:04.760 --> 28:05.795
IN A PARKED CAR.

28:05.830 --> 28:06.967
YOU'LL GET PICKED UP
FOR MOPERY.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.433
MOPERY?
WITH INTENT TO CREEP.

28:08.470 --> 28:11.030
TRUST ME, IT'LL KICK
A BIG HOLE IN YOUR FUTURE.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.088
[sighs]

28:32.250 --> 28:35.048
I GUESS IT WASN'T A BODY.

28:44.140 --> 28:51.012
GUS?

28:51.050 --> 28:52.187
[chuckles]

28:52.220 --> 28:53.949
WELL DONE, SPENCER.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.491
I DON'T KNOW, CHIEF.

28:55.530 --> 28:56.656
YOU WANT ME TO TRY
AND GET HER STATEMENT?

28:56.700 --> 28:59.589
OF COURSE, I DON'T SPEAK
MANNEQUIN.

28:59.640 --> 29:00.959
CUTE.

29:01.010 --> 29:02.170
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HOLD OFF
ON THAT

29:02.210 --> 29:03.472
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE
ALL THE MERCHANDISE

29:03.480 --> 29:06.278
FROM THE ZILK'S BURGLARIES.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.548
EXCELLENT WORK, MR. SPENCER.

29:07.590 --> 29:08.750
THANKS, CHIEF.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.655
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

29:10.690 --> 29:12.726
SO THE BURGLARS WEREN'T AFTER
THE MERCHANDISE.

29:12.760 --> 29:13.795
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:13.830 --> 29:15.263
SO WHAT WERE THEY AFTER?

29:17.010 --> 29:19.729
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.202
FIVE, FOUR.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.047
FOUR, FIVE.
WHAT?

29:23.080 --> 29:24.843
I'M SEEING FOUR
AND I'M SEEING FIVE.

29:24.890 --> 29:25.914
LASSIE, FOUR AND FIVE!

29:25.960 --> 29:27.211
NINE?
THE NUMBER NINE?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.921
NO, FOUR TIMES FIVE.
20?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.257
5 AND 20.
5 TIMES 20.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.096
100.

29:31.130 --> 29:32.734
MINUS FOUR TIMES FOUR
TIMES FIVE.

29:32.770 --> 29:33.759
FOUR TIMES FOUR TIMES FIVE?

29:33.810 --> 29:35.004
80.
NO, 20.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.179
100 MINUS 80 IS 20.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.609
WE ALL HAVE OUR MATH FACTS
STRAIGHT, MR. SPENCER.

29:38.650 --> 29:39.617
IS THIS GOING SOMEWHERE?

29:39.650 --> 29:41.880
SKATER NUMBER 20.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.217
SHE'S THE ONE WHO DUMPED
ALL THIS STUFF.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.784
THAT'S RITA "LETHAL WEAPON"
WESTWOOD.

29:44.830 --> 29:46.752
OKAY, GREAT, WE GOT ONE.

29:46.800 --> 29:47.619
WE NEED ALL OF 'EM.

29:47.670 --> 29:48.989
CORRECT.
THIS IS BIGGER THAN WESTWOOD.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.337
A LOT BIGGER.

29:50.370 --> 29:51.632
JULIET'S CLOSE.

29:51.670 --> 29:54.173
OKAY.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.814
LASSITER, LET'S GET SOMEONE
ON THE LOOKOUT

29:55.850 --> 29:57.579
FOR ANY MORE DUMPING SITES
AROUND TOWN.

30:03.360 --> 30:03.598
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO ZILK'S,

30:03.600 --> 30:05.693
AND WE'VE GOT TO CHECK
SOMETHING OUT.

30:05.740 --> 30:06.832
IF YOU SAY "PANTS,"

30:06.870 --> 30:07.859
I'M GONNA SOCK YOU
IN YOUR ADAM'S APPLE.

30:07.910 --> 30:09.730
SOCK YOU IN YOUR...

30:09.780 --> 30:12.715
[line ringing]

30:12.750 --> 30:14.149
HEY, IT'S ME.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.316
LISTEN, WE GOT A SITUATION.

30:15.350 --> 30:16.385
WHAT IS IT?

30:16.420 --> 30:17.318
WESTWOOD
SCREWED UP AGAIN HUGE.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.691
THE COPS FOUND EVERYTHING.

30:18.730 --> 30:19.856
IF THEY GET TO HER,
SHE'S GONNA TALK.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.867
THIS IS BAD.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.128
YEAH, AND IT GETS WORSE.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.728
MANIAC'S FAN BOY'S
ALSO HERE.

30:23.770 --> 30:24.737
DOING WHAT?

30:24.770 --> 30:25.998
HE'S WORKING WITH THE COPS.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.200
ARE WE COMPROMISED?

30:27.250 --> 30:29.946
I DON'T KNOW, BUT AFTER
WE HANDLE WESTWOOD,

30:29.980 --> 30:33.256
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE
A TALK WITH MANIAC.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.767
(Gus)
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE,
SHAWN?

30:37.800 --> 30:39.939
WE ALREADY KNOW
IT WASN'T THE MERCHANDISE.

30:39.970 --> 30:43.178
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

30:45.150 --> 30:46.412
LET'S GO.

30:47.420 --> 30:48.910
[sighs]

30:51.160 --> 30:53.321
DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.329
YOU LIFTED YOUR LOOK
RIGHT OFF THIS MANNEQUIN.

30:56.370 --> 30:57.928
ON THE CONTRARY, SHAWN.

30:57.970 --> 30:59.278
CLEARLY, SOMEONE IS STEALING
MY LOOK.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.299
RIGHT.

31:00.340 --> 31:03.138
I DID SEE TOMMY HILFIGER
CREEPING FROM BUSH TO BUSH

31:03.180 --> 31:03.714
SKETCHING YOU.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.324
AND WE'RE MOVING.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.361
BUT YOUR FRIEND CAN'T COME.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.841
THE THIEVES WERE AFTER
SOMETHING IN THIS ROOM.

31:20.890 --> 31:22.209
DUDE, WE CAN'T GO
INSIDE THERE.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.352
READ THE SIGN.

31:23.390 --> 31:25.119
"LAURA NOID.
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH."

31:25.160 --> 31:26.252
YOU KNOW HER?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.222
NOT THAT ONE.
"EMPLOYEES ONLY."

31:28.270 --> 31:30.807
GOTCHA.
BE MY LOOKOUT.

31:30.840 --> 31:31.932
NO PROBLEM.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.369
I'LL JUST KEEP IT SAFE
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

31:33.410 --> 31:35.378
AAH!

31:35.410 --> 31:37.389
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.251
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

31:39.290 --> 31:43.124
THIS IS MY PARTNER...

31:43.160 --> 31:44.229
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M BLANKING.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.294
I'VE DONE THIS
A MILLION TIMES.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.309
NICE WORK.
OFFICE, CODE BLUE.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.069
IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE NOT HERE TO ROB YOU.

31:49.110 --> 31:51.249
WELL, YOUR BUDDY STOLE THE
CLOTHES RIGHT OFF THE MANNEQUIN.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.168
THESE ARE MY CLOTHES.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.017
LOOK, WE DON'T KEEP
THE CASH BACK HERE.

31:55.050 --> 31:56.312
THIS IS THE CREDIT DEPARTMENT.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.453
WE JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE BURGLARY.

31:58.490 --> 32:00.219
OH, DO YOU, MANNEQUIN MAN?

32:00.260 --> 32:01.591
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL THAT

32:01.630 --> 32:02.597
TO MY LI'ITLE CAN
OF PEPPER SPRAY?

32:02.630 --> 32:05.030
WHOA, WHOA!
HEY, HEY, HEY!

32:05.070 --> 32:06.037
STUART!

32:06.080 --> 32:07.377
SHAWN?
TELL HER!

32:07.410 --> 32:08.377
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

32:08.410 --> 32:10.617
THESE GUYS ARE WITH THE POLICE.

32:10.650 --> 32:13.619
WHY IS YOUR FRIEND DRESSED
LIKE THE MANNEQUIN?

32:13.660 --> 32:16.527
THAT MANNEQUIN IS DRESSED
LIKE ME.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.663
THANK YOU.
CAN WE GO, SHAWN?

32:17.700 --> 32:19.190
HOLD UP.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING OVER THERE?

32:19.240 --> 32:21.162
OH, UH, IT'S FRIDAY.

32:21.210 --> 32:23.303
I WAS SHREDDING CREDIT CARD
APPLICATIONS.

32:23.340 --> 32:25.001
IT'S THE ONLY FUN THING
I GET TO DO.

32:31.690 --> 32:34.295
BURGLARY HAPPENED
ON A THURSDAY.

32:34.330 --> 32:38.562
THE DAY BEFORE THEY SHRED
THE CREDIT APPLICATIONS.

32:38.610 --> 32:39.577
THANKS, GUYS.

32:39.610 --> 32:42.044
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU,
STU.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.208
(Stuart)
I GOT MOVED FROM NIGHTS
TO DAYS AFTER THE--

32:45.250 --> 32:46.285
[door slams]

32:49.130 --> 32:50.961
JULES, I'M GE'ITING
SOME STRONG MESSAGES.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.297
OKAY, WHAT ARE THEY?

32:52.330 --> 32:53.558
FIRST ONE'S FROM KEANU REEVES.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.033
HE'S LIVING IN A HOUSE
I BUILT ON A LAKE

32:55.070 --> 32:56.378
TWO YEARS IN THE PAST.

32:56.410 --> 32:57.377
HOW WILL I MEET HIM?

32:57.410 --> 32:59.412
THE SECOND
IS THAT THE THIEVES

32:59.450 --> 33:00.644
WERE NOT
AFTER THE MERCHANDISE.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.511
WELL, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT,
SHAWN.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.959
THEY WERE USING
THE HAND SCANNERS

33:03.960 --> 33:06.155
TO STEAL INFORMATION
OFF CREDIT CARD APPLICATIONS.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.224
THEY'RE STEALING

33:07.260 --> 33:08.693
IDENTITIES.

33:08.730 --> 33:09.731
OH, SO THEN RANSACKING
THE STORE

33:09.770 --> 33:11.067
AND STEALING THE MERCHANDISE

33:11.110 --> 33:12.065
WAS JUST TO THROW US
OFF THE TRAIL.

33:12.110 --> 33:13.236
RIGHT-O.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.542
A HANDFUL OF FAKE CREDIT CARDS

33:14.580 --> 33:15.649
IS WORTH MORE THAN EVERYTHING

33:15.680 --> 33:16.749
IN THAT ENTIRE STORE

33:16.780 --> 33:17.747
TIMES TEN.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.417
IT'S A PRE'ITY BRILLIANT PLAN.

33:19.460 --> 33:20.586
ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS BRILLIANT

33:20.620 --> 33:22.724
THAN THAT YOUTUBE VIDEO
OF THE MONKEY BATHING THE CAT.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.695
(Wilde)
HEY, MANIAC.

33:25.730 --> 33:28.130
WE NEED YOU TO COME
WITH US, MANIAC.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.728
RIGHT NOW.

33:29.780 --> 33:31.179
JULES, WHO IS THAT?
WHO'S TALKING?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.643
[phone hangs up]

33:32.680 --> 33:33.715
WE GO'ITA GO.

33:43.370 --> 33:44.462
SO WE HAVE THREE SUSPECT S.

33:44.510 --> 33:45.465
TWO TO GO.

33:45.510 --> 33:46.477
AND YOU THINK THEY'RE ON
TO JULIET?

33:46.510 --> 33:47.499
I SAID THEY MIGHT BE.

33:47.550 --> 33:49.177
EITHER WAY, WE'RE GONNA
FIND OUT PRE'ITY QUICK.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.448
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL DO TO HER?

33:54.660 --> 33:57.356
(Juliet)
WESTWOOD GAVE IT TO ME.
IT'S A ROLLER DERBY THING.

34:00.800 --> 34:10.857
THEY MAY'VE DONE IT ALREADY.

34:10.860 --> 34:16.730
THEY MAY'VE DONE IT ALREADY.

34:16.770 --> 34:18.704
THAT'S WESTWOOD'S TRUCK.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.498
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

34:29.530 --> 34:31.862
LOOK FOR SOMETHING
TO JIMMY THE LOCK.

34:37.650 --> 34:39.845
OH!

34:41.950 --> 34:43.850
[sighs]
OH, THANK GOD.

34:43.890 --> 34:45.528
THANK GOD?

34:45.560 --> 34:46.754
IT'S A DEAD PERSON.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.222
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT JULIET.

34:48.270 --> 34:49.567
IT'S STILL A HUMAN BEING,
SHAWN.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.567
IT'S WESTWOOD.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.806
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

34:51.840 --> 34:54.673
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'D RATHER
IT BE SOMEONE

34:54.710 --> 34:56.644
THAT WE KNOW AND CARE ABOUT?

34:56.680 --> 34:58.318
FINE, NEXT TIME I SEE JULES,

34:58.350 --> 34:59.510
I'LL JUST TELL HER YOU WISH
SHE WAS DEAD.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.221
I NEVER SAID
THAT I WISH JULIET WAS DEAD.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.854
LEAD JAMMER MRS. BASH
IS TRAPPED IN THE PACK.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.891
SPEED FREAK TRYING
TO SLASH THROUGH

35:05.930 --> 35:08.603
PISMO'S VULNERABLE
INSIDE LINE.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.301
THE TROLLOPS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO DO A 180

35:10.340 --> 35:11.307
IN THE SECOND HALF
TONIGHT.

35:11.350 --> 35:12.203
MANIAC!

35:12.250 --> 35:13.911
(announcer)
UNLESS HAYSEED WANNABE

35:13.950 --> 35:16.384
AND OFF-WHITE TRASH
HAVE THEIR WAY,

35:16.420 --> 35:17.956
IT MIGHT JUST HAPPEN.

35:17.990 --> 35:21.289
IT'S DOWN TO THE WIRE,
FRIENDS.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.024
OH, MY GOD, THE ROLLER GIRLS
ARE ONTO JULIET.

35:35.060 --> 35:35.856
(Gus)
WHICH ONES?

35:35.890 --> 35:37.653
THE BAD ONES,
AND I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.065
THEY'RE MARKING
THEIR OWN TEAMMATE.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.829
THEY WANT TO HURT HER
OR WORSE.

35:40.870 --> 35:42.531
(announcer)
HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.276
WE GO'ITA DO SOMETHING.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.927
THINGS ARE HEATING UP
OUT HERE, PEOPLE.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.394
I HOPE YOU'VE BROUGHT
PROTECTION.

35:56.440 --> 35:59.409
AND NOW,
AROUND THE CURVE...

36:05.420 --> 36:06.717
EH.

36:08.390 --> 36:09.129
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:09.160 --> 36:10.058
YOU'VE BEEN COMPLAINING
ABOUT ME

36:10.100 --> 36:11.124
NOT BEING ANY HELP HERE,

36:11.160 --> 36:12.559
AND THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.897
THEY'RE GONNA TRY
TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT,

36:13.940 --> 36:15.100
BUT NOT BEFORE
THEY TAKE JULIET DOWN.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.903
YES, YES, BUT THIS
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.477
I CAN SKATE, SHAWN.
I GOT THIS.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.078
WHAT ARE YOU--

36:21.120 --> 36:24.453
(announcer)
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
A GUEST ON THE TRACK.

36:24.490 --> 36:26.128
YOU'RE TAKING YOUR LIFE
IN YOUR HANDS, PAL.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.544
AND OH,
SPEED FREAK GOES DOWN!

36:36.580 --> 36:39.014
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

36:43.930 --> 36:45.420
OH, MAN!

37:01.230 --> 37:02.197
[groans]

37:02.230 --> 37:03.936
[cheers and applause]

37:05.840 --> 37:07.205
WATCH OUT!
OH!

37:07.240 --> 37:12.985
[overlapping shouting]

37:13.020 --> 37:16.148
[cheers and applause]

37:16.190 --> 37:17.691
[mouths words]

37:26.550 --> 37:28.518
FOUR SUSPECT S.

37:28.550 --> 37:29.710
(Juliet)
IT WAS IDENTITY THEFT, CHIEF.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.284
THEY WERE ONLY AFTER
THE INFORMATION

37:31.320 --> 37:33.891
OFF THE CREDIT CARD APPLICATIONS
THE CUSTOMERS FILL OUT.

37:33.930 --> 37:35.625
ALL OF THE STORES THEY HIT

37:35.670 --> 37:36.796
HAD SIMILAR
CREDIT CARD PROGRAMS.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.728
THEY BREAK IN,
WREAK HAVOC,

37:38.770 --> 37:41.273
AND SPLIT BEFORE THE CLOCK
RUNS OUT.

37:41.310 --> 37:43.175
JUST THE KIND OF ANARCHY
THEIR FANS PAY FOR

37:43.220 --> 37:44.244
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.

37:44.290 --> 37:45.314
I GOT PRINTS OFF A KEY PIECE

37:45.350 --> 37:46.612
OF EVIDENCE I FOUND HERE.

37:46.660 --> 37:47.729
SHE GOT 'EM WHEN

37:47.760 --> 37:49.648
SHE WASN'T BUSY
KICKING ASS.

37:49.700 --> 37:50.553
HUH?

37:50.600 --> 37:52.693
[loudly]
CAN I HEAR SOMETHING
FOR MANIAC?

37:52.740 --> 37:53.889
SHE REALLY BROUGHT IT, HUH?

37:53.940 --> 37:55.703
AM I RIGHT?
WHO'S WITH ME?

37:55.740 --> 37:58.300
LASSITER, TAKE THEM AWAY.

37:58.350 --> 37:59.339
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.

37:59.380 --> 38:01.314
I'M SEEING
THE FIFTH SUSPECT.

38:01.350 --> 38:03.181
SHE GET AWAY?

38:03.220 --> 38:04.551
NO.

38:04.560 --> 38:08.690
RITA "LETHAL WEAPON"
WESTWOOD.

38:08.730 --> 38:10.368
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'LL FIND

38:10.400 --> 38:13.699
HER BODY IN HER PICKUP TRUCK
IN THE PARKING LOT.

38:13.740 --> 38:16.641
SHE'S THE ONE THAT BOTCHED
THE MERCHANDISE DROP.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.649
SHE PAID DEARLY FOR IT.

38:19.690 --> 38:20.884
ANYTHING ELSE?

38:20.920 --> 38:23.753
UM...NOT REALLY.

38:23.800 --> 38:28.339
DID I MENTION JULIET'S
ROLLER DERBY AWESOMENESS, HUH?

38:30.880 --> 38:32.370
I CAN'T GET ANYTHING
FROM THESE PEOPLE.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.672
THEY'RE MURDERERS, SHAWN.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.687
THEY'RE GOING AWAY FOR LIFE.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.381
I GO'ITA STUDY.

38:36.420 --> 38:37.387
LASSITER,

38:37.420 --> 38:39.729
TAKE THEM AWAY.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.398
ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.661
YOU TWO WORK TOGETHER WELL.

38:44.710 --> 38:46.234
I CERTAINLY THINK SO.

38:46.270 --> 38:47.749
WE'RE AVAILABLE
FOR MORE CASES, BY THE WAY.

38:47.780 --> 38:49.668
EMBEZZLEMENT, EXTORTION,

UNDER ADVISEMENT.

39:02.210 --> 39:03.871
OH, YEAH.

39:03.910 --> 39:04.672
PEOPLE STEAL ELEPHANTS?

39:04.680 --> 39:06.841
MAJOR PROBLEM.

39:06.880 --> 39:07.972
PRE'ITY MUCH OUT OF CONTROL.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.201
OH, HEY, JULES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:21.240 --> 39:23.379
I'M RETURNING MY EQUIPMENT.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.739
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:24.790 --> 39:29.454
JUST HANGIN', YOU KNOW?
CHILLIN'.

39:29.490 --> 39:32.459
I WAS ACTUALLY FEELING
A LITTLE NOSTALGIC.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.058
REMEMBER WHEN WE CRACKED
THAT CASE HERE

39:34.100 --> 39:36.807
AND THE CRIMINALS TURNED OUT
TO BE ROLLER DERBY GIRLS?

39:36.840 --> 39:39.104
YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.

39:39.150 --> 39:42.278
GOSH, SEEMS LIKE
IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.778
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT WAS
YESTERDAY.

39:45.830 --> 39:47.127
WHY ARE YOU WEARING SKATES?

39:47.160 --> 39:49.833
OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

I GUESS I AM.

39:51.170 --> 39:52.831
I DON'T KNOW.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.440
I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS A SHAME.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.539
WE HAVE THIS BIG,
BEAUTIFUL TRACK

39:57.580 --> 39:59.389
AND NO ONE TO SKATE ON IT.

39:59.420 --> 40:00.387
IT'S ALSO BEEN A LONG WHILE

40:00.420 --> 40:01.853

ON PURPOSE?

40:30.980 --> 40:32.641
NO.

40:32.690 --> 40:35.386
MAYBE.

40:35.430 --> 40:37.921
OKAY, YES.
YES, I DID.

YOU TOOK MY EXAM?

41:23.790 --> 41:25.087
LI'ITLE HARDER THAN
THE RIVER RAFT TEST.

41:25.130 --> 41:27.621
WAY EASIER THAN
THE SECRET SERVICE TEST.

41:27.660 --> 41:29.366
ANY OF THE QUESTIONS
I DIDN'T KNOW

41:29.400 --> 41:30.367
I JUST ANSWERED "C,"
RIGHT?

41:30.400 --> 41:34.279
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

41:34.310 --> 41:36.073
DUDE, IT'S DONE.

A PHARMACEUTICAL REP.

41:49.210 --> 41:50.404
BUT HEY, WHATEVER.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.476
I STUDIED FOR THIS TEST
ALL WEEK FOR NOTHING.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.148
YES, YOU DID.

41:54.180 --> 41:56.182
BUT THAT'S THE SORT OF THING
THAT BUILDS CHARACTER.
