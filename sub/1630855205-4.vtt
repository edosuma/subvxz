00:19.436 --> 00:22.231
- Welcome to my humble abode.
- Wow. Really nice.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.609
- Come in.
- Cool. Thank you.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.280
We have leftovers if you're hungry.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.573
Some hash browns. Nice.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.707
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.628
- I thought that was my uncle for a second.
- You must have a hot uncle.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.297
- I'm Will.
- I'm Maddie. Hi.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.300
- Let's go to my room.
- Yeah.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.681
Nice room.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.063
Is this okay? Should we keep doing this?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.482
It's fine. I closed the door.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.078
Do I have formal consent to engage

01:18.078 --> 01:20.581
in sexual fornications with you?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.749
- It's fine. Thank you.
- Great. Thank you.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.549
Hey! I thought you were gonna watch
the finale with me.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.633
Oh, my God. Come watch.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.802
I'm kind of in the middle
of something important.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.513
Oh, my God.
Riley is texting about it right now.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.849
- Okay.
- Why don't you guys just watch it?

01:38.849 --> 01:40.559
- It's fine. It's totally cool.
- No! Come on.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.020
- I'll come back another time.
- You'll spoil it. Stop, Riley.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.606
- What the fuck? You were supposed to wait.
- I'm sorry.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.858
- That's such a cute bra.
- Thank you.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.401
- Your boobs look amazing.
- Really?

01:49.401 --> 01:50.944
Yeah. I got your favorite kind.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.197
The coconut oil, it tastes like butter.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.907
- Is the rest of the season--
- Bye.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.450
- Bye. Nice meeting you.
- Bye. You too.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.993
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Enjoy.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.121
- Love your shirt.
- Thank you. Have a good one.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.247
Okay.
So what exactly is gonna happen here?

02:43.247 --> 02:44.581
I've never been to a divorce party.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.335
One of the moms in Frances's baby group
had one, like, three years ago,

02:48.335 --> 02:51.213
and we all had to give an impromptu speech

02:51.213 --> 02:53.674
- to lift up the woman who got divorced.
- Jesus Christ.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.425
- I hate public speaking.
- I know. Me too.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.135
That's why
I came up with something this time.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.596
What? You didn't tell me
I was supposed to write something.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.599
It's okay. I'm gonna pretend
I'd, like, make it up on the spot.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.851
I'm gonna say, like, you know,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.227
"Throughout our lifetime,

03:05.227 --> 03:09.690
we will be lost and found,
lost and found hundreds of times.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.109
But it's just a moment and it'll pass,

03:12.109 --> 03:15.070
and what's important
is that we're all there for each other."

03:15.070 --> 03:16.822
Yeah. That's suitable for Christine

03:16.822 --> 03:19.658
and her New Age California
hippie green juice bullshit.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.410
- Right?
- Yeah.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.745
- You have crystals.
- Yeah. There's no downside.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.498
Ladies. Ladi--

03:26.498 --> 03:28.500
- Hi! Just in time.
- Hi.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.335
- Hey.
- Everybody have a seat.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.297
First of all,
I want to thank everybody for being here

03:33.297 --> 03:35.799
and coming to help support Christine

03:35.799 --> 03:39.469
through this very challenging
chapter of her life.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.264
And we're going
to do a support circle right now

03:42.264 --> 03:46.351
where we say uplifting
and nurturing things to Christine.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.437
Who'd like to get us started?

03:51.315 --> 03:54.067
Katie, how about you?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.488
- Me first?
- Yeah.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.869
Okay. Yeah, of course.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.126
Christine, I--

04:13.629 --> 04:20.469
Throughout your lifetime, you're gonna
be lost and found... hundreds of times.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.096
Lost and found.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.681
We all will be.

04:27.893 --> 04:31.396
This is just a moment that will pass.

04:32.773 --> 04:37.653
But what is important
is that we are all here for each other.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.073
Oh, my God.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.408
That was a beautiful way
to get us started, Katie.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.910
- Thank you.
- Katie, come here.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.705
- That was so special.
- It was from the heart.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.874
I'm sorry.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.502
Sylvia, you want to go next?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.797
- It's a hard act to follow.
- Thanks.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.176
My parents got divorced,

05:01.176 --> 05:03.637
and it was the best thing
that ever happened to my dad.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.556
He just flourished.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.142
He joined a yachting club,
and he wrote a memoir.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.519
He opened a restaurant at one point.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.938
He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

05:12.938 --> 05:17.067
And he just-- He lived till 85,
and he lived life to the fullest.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.652
And so will you, Christine.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.654
"So will you."

05:20.654 --> 05:22.447
- Thank you.
- How inspiring is that?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.825
And what happened to your mom?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.577
She's a disaster.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.870
That was terrible.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.913
She didn't recover.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.375
But she's alive.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.794
Yeah. If you can call it that.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.385
I have always loved Sylvia's spiciness.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.096
But she ate a speech.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.015
Well, we've been married a very long time.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.267
She is full of surprises.
Keeps life interesting.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.353
Sylvia is clearly going through
some sort of midlife crisis.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.106
You know, with work and the mommy track,
blah, blah, blah.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.193
Better eating a speech
than getting a back tattoo

05:59.193 --> 06:00.485
or Eat, Pray, Love'ing.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.737
So, I have a plan.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.741
I called Kirk Friedkin over at Tobey
because I heard they're expanding

06:05.741 --> 06:06.867
their M&A department.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.286
And it turns out they are hiring.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.581
- I would just say...
- Yeah?

06:12.581 --> 06:16.627
...that, whatever you do to get involved
in her work life, you keep it casual.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.128
Yeah. I'm just trying to help.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.048
I'm just saying that sometimes you can
be kind of intense about these things.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.090
What do you mean?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.092
Your hands are literally
in fists right now.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.971
My wife ate my boss's speech like a dog.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.723
Of course I am stressed.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.768
Yes, Charlie. And if you want
to help Sylvia,

06:32.768 --> 06:36.563
give her Kirk's card
and let her do with it

06:36.563 --> 06:38.524
- what she wants to do with it.
- Yeah.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.901
Just be chill.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.653
Try to pretend to be chill.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.906
Yes. I can do that 100%.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.409
But maybe don't be 100%.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.203
Maybe be 30%.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.957
Maybe just, "Hey, babe, here's the card.
I gotta go chill."

06:54.957 --> 06:57.376
- Do you see what I'm doing there?
- Yeah.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.504
Give her the card and then step back,
like a chill guy.

07:00.504 --> 07:01.755
Totally agree.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.591
Quiznos for lunch.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.968
Yes!

07:05.968 --> 07:08.095
Okay, Frances,
can we set the table, please?

07:09.805 --> 07:12.349
- Hi! Hi.
- Hi!

07:12.349 --> 07:14.685
Hey, why aren't there
any dino nuggets left?

07:14.685 --> 07:17.938
What's the point of having a shopping list
if no one puts anything on it?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.023
I'm sorry. I finished them.

07:20.023 --> 07:23.151
You ate those things? They're disgusting.
They're made from, like, chickens' beaks.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.570
They're made from chickens' beaks?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.154
No, I'm just kidding.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.573
Why do you give them to the kids?

07:27.573 --> 07:30.033
Because they just eat them
and I'm too tired to argue.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.118
Hi.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.788
So, vis-Ã -vis
what we were discussing the other day

07:34.788 --> 07:36.290
at the partners retreat,

07:36.290 --> 07:38.333
I have something for you.

07:38.333 --> 07:43.589
Yes. What's this? "Kirk Friedkin"
of "Tobey, Friedkin, Kwong and Zelman."

07:43.589 --> 07:46.091
- What's this?
- Kirk Friedkin. He's a guy I know.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.719
Who's Kirk Friedkin?
What are you guys talking about?

07:48.719 --> 07:51.138
- He is a lawyer.
- Yes. I gathered that from context.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.639
Okay. So I was talking to him today,

07:52.639 --> 07:55.184
and he mentioned they're expanding
their M&A department.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.643
And he said to give him a call.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.604
I didn't ask you to do that.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.190
Oh, no.
I know. I know Kirk. We go way back.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.358
Okay. Well, I'm not your charity case.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.443
What's a charity case?

08:04.443 --> 08:06.987
That's not what's going on.
I'm doing him a favor, not you.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.448
Does he know
that I haven't practiced for 13 years?

08:09.448 --> 08:10.782
- He does.
- What's a charity case?

08:10.782 --> 08:13.160
Does he know I can only work
between the hours of 9:00 and 2:00?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.621
- Yes. He was cool with that.
- What's a charity case?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.456
Does he know that I am a terrible lawyer?

08:17.456 --> 08:20.167
- I kept that part under wraps.
- What's a charity case?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.628
It's when you do someone a favor
because you pity them.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.338
Frances, please can you set the table?

08:24.338 --> 08:26.840
- I'm doing it!
- I'm sorry, are you mad about this?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.675
Mad? No, I'm grateful.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.136
- That's nice of him. I'm surprised.
- Why are you being weird?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.804
I'm not being weird.
I'm just listening to Dad.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.057
So when should I call him?
In a week or something?

08:35.057 --> 08:36.683
- No, call him now.
- Yeah, now.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.852
- I'll call him now. It's a good time.
- Okay. Well, call him whenever.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.105
You have his card now,
so whatever you want to do,

08:42.105 --> 08:44.316
that is-- That's swell. Hi.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.055
Hi, this is Sylvia Greeves.
I was just referring-- No.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.516
Hi. This is Sylvia Greeves.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.394
I was just calling in regards to-- myself.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.355
Mr. Friedkin.
Sylvia Greeves. Yes, attorney at law.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.608
When have I ever said that?
When has anyone--

09:26.608 --> 09:27.818
Has anyone ever said that?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.028
You can do this. So...

09:31.738 --> 09:35.742
- Yo.
- What's up, dawg? You free?

09:36.827 --> 09:40.205
Who announces that
they're moving in together on Instagram?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.708
How fucking lame is that, right?

09:42.708 --> 09:45.460
- It's tacky.
- It's thirsty is what it is.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.879
Like, who fucking cares?

09:47.379 --> 09:49.673
You moved in together.
Congratu-fucking-lations.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.800
You post about it?
You fucking post about it?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.051
- On the grid?
- On the grid!

09:53.051 --> 09:55.053
- On the grid!
- Put that shit on your stories.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.930
- I know. You don't go grid.
- Right?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.557
- You don't go grid with that.
- No.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.100
That, not for the grid.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.478
Why don't you post on your grid shit
that actually people give a fuck about?

10:03.478 --> 10:06.064
Engagement. Graduation. Baby.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.858
- Old dog birthday.
- Right?

10:07.858 --> 10:08.984
That I wanna see.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.569
- Death. The big--
- Give me--

10:10.569 --> 10:12.613
- Tell me your grandma died.
- The big ones!

10:12.613 --> 10:14.531
- Activism.
- You're at a march!

10:14.531 --> 10:16.950
- Pink hats!
- Post if you're storming the Capitol.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.578
Then we can arrest you
and probably not charge you.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.872
- That's what I wanna see.
- That's the good stuff.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.957
Moving in with someone,
not an accomplishment.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.043
- Not an accomplishment.
- You've done nothing.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.253
- The toothbrushes.
- Two toothbrushes in a cup?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.297
- That's lame.
- Who fucking cares about that?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.673
Such a reach.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.800
Or unless if she's moving
into a new house,

10:33.800 --> 10:36.803
which I would wanna see
just 'cause Audrey's got such good taste.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.263
- You know?
- Hey.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.265
Why?

10:41.350 --> 10:42.351
Thought you would catch it.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.394
You know I'm not good at sport.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.567
How are you, buddy?

10:52.027 --> 10:54.321
I just feel like she did that,
like, to me, you know?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.240
Like, she knows I'm active
on social media.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.242
You know what could help?

10:58.784 --> 11:01.703
If I threw you a divorce party.
Could be really fun.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.831
- What is that? Is that a thing?
- It's a thing. I've been to a few.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.834
I just went--
I literally just went to one.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.669
It's a bunch of friends getting together

11:08.669 --> 11:10.879
and helping you feel better
and find closure.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.925
I'm trying to think of a sarcastic thing
to say about that, but hon--

11:14.925 --> 11:16.176
it sounds quite nice.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.721
It sounds like I could maybe use that.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.350
Right? I'll organize it. You don't have
to worry about it. It'll be fun.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.019
I just don't wanna be,
like, dwelling on the past, you know?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.939
I want it to be--
I'm very future-oriented right now.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.232
I want it to be about the future.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.442
To the future.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.445
Okay. Not, like, a future with robots
and spaceships and shit like that.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.030
Like the immediate future, okay?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.240
Affirmative.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.742
Don't show up dressed like a robot.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.870
I'll take care of it.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.080
I'll organize a really good party

11:45.664 --> 11:47.624
with all your weird friends.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.836
Why is the Plasma bike in the bathroom?

11:50.836 --> 11:53.422
Why is the anything in the anywhere?

11:54.047 --> 11:57.050
Wow! Jessipa poops so much
for someone her size.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.305
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

12:03.682 --> 12:04.725
This house is too small.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.977
Yeah. Has anything come
on the market this week?

12:06.977 --> 12:08.478
Nothing we can afford.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.771
Is the...

12:10.355 --> 12:12.441
Yeah. The nursing home's still available,

12:12.441 --> 12:16.361
but Will said that construction
would be really long and expensive.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.613
Yeah.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.449
He knows a bit about it.
You know, he's renovated a lot of bars.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.869
Yeah. No, I know. I just feel like
that's a decision you and I should make,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.370
not you and Will.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.497
Yeah, noted.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.834
- So, how'd it go with Kirk?
- Who?

12:31.668 --> 12:34.296
Kirk Friedkin,
the lawyer friend you were gonna call.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.965
Yeah. That Kirk Friedkin.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.092
You said you were gonna call him.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.305
- Kirk. You were gonna call him.
- Yes. I know. I'm on to it.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.265
You didn't call him.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.977
Well, I-- You just gave me his number,
so I'm going to.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.063
Just give me a minute. I'm working on it.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.190
You're working on making a call?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.025
Babe, why are you hassling me about this?

12:55.025 --> 12:57.736
I asked you if you called the person.
It's-- Whatever.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.780
- And I will.
- Okay.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.365
Where are you going again tonight?

13:01.365 --> 13:03.033
It's Will's divorce party.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.910
Yeah. He's really going through it.

13:04.910 --> 13:08.038
You know that Audrey's already moved
in with her new boyfriend?

13:08.038 --> 13:09.331
I can't imagine.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.374
- Yeah.
- Wow.

13:10.374 --> 13:11.625
- So tacky.
- Well, have fun.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.835
- All right.
- Bye.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.045
- Do you wanna-- Okay.
- Ye--

13:15.045 --> 13:16.129
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.849
- Yo. So, what are we doing here again?
- We're celebrating me.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.017
So, it's like a birthday party
but not on your birthday?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.477
It's a divorce party.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.896
That's not a thing.
But I do like partying.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.398
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.816
What's going on?

13:36.567 --> 13:41.738
What? I just saw one
of the moms from school at the valet.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.282
You owe her money or something?

13:43.282 --> 13:47.202
No, I just-- I owe her a phone call
and I just-- I can't be bothered to deal.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.997
Wassup?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.832
Thanks for the invite, Omar.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.209
Big Willy, congrats on the divorce.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.379
The bottle of Cristal is on me tonight.
You're welcome.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.256
You're gonna get one bottle
for the whole table?

13:59.256 --> 14:00.674
Yes, and I'm paying. You're welcome.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.925
Who are these guys?

14:01.925 --> 14:03.177
These guys?

14:03.177 --> 14:05.512
My frat bros. You're gonna love 'em.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.889
Hamza, speak.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.391
Why the fuck did you invite him, man?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.310
I didn't want it to be awkward
at work tomorrow.

14:11.310 --> 14:15.689
Sylvia. I thought that was you,
but I didn't see Charlie.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.567
Did you get my message
about the music lesson?

14:18.567 --> 14:21.111
I did. I did get your message.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.530
I will call you back. I'm so sorry.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.241
- I think our table's ready.
- Okay. Cool. Bye.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.202
Okay.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.663
Just while we have a minute
before we get too wasted,

14:31.663 --> 14:34.625
- how about another round of toasts?
- Hey!

14:34.625 --> 14:35.834
I'll start.

14:35.834 --> 14:40.339
Will, throughout your lifetime,
you're gonna be lost hundreds of times,

14:40.339 --> 14:41.882
hundreds of times.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.593
And you're lost right now.
But we're all here for you.

14:49.932 --> 14:50.849
To being lost.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.768
To being lost.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.856
I'm not gonna lie, Sylvia.
He's at the lowest point of his life,

14:57.856 --> 15:00.943
and you tell him it's going to happen
a hundred more times. Little tough.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.694
I'm saying it's gonna happen to all of us.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.613
- That's what I meant. It's part of life.
- Yeah.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.781
- We all get lost.
- Yeah.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.283
- I like that, Sylvia.
- Thank you, Omar.

15:08.283 --> 15:12.246
Right, because somebody came into his life
and kind of fucked it up for a little bit.

15:12.246 --> 15:15.290
And luckily, he doesn't have to deal
with her fake-ass bullshit no more.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.668
Why don't we set a few ground rules
for the evening?

15:17.668 --> 15:20.796
Like, we don't all need
to be talking shit about my ex-wife.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.798
So, you know, nothing too negative.

15:22.798 --> 15:26.009
Or if it helps you
to get something off your chest,

15:26.009 --> 15:28.053
maybe go for it
because that's why we're here.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.931
He might have a point.
Should we go around the table

15:30.931 --> 15:33.225
and everyone says the five things
they hate about her the most?

15:33.225 --> 15:36.019
I don't know if women-bashing is
in the spirit of the evening.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.771
Don't look at it as women-bashing.

15:37.771 --> 15:41.149
Look at it like we're talking shit
about somebody who happens to be a woman.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.693
She also happens to be my sister.

15:42.693 --> 15:45.612
And that's why I am Team Sylvia.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.864
Yes. What?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.533
- Look...
- Okay. Looking forward to the future.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.619
Will, I think you should ask that girl
out on a date.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.040
- Which one?
- Whichever.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.084
- Yeah. We're all the same.
- I didn't say that.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.128
But for the purpose of this moment,
they are.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.546
- All right.
- Yeah!

16:02.546 --> 16:04.882
- Yeah, Will.
- Big Will!

16:04.882 --> 16:07.718
Will! Will! Will! Will! Will! Will!

16:07.718 --> 16:09.136
Yeah!

16:09.136 --> 16:10.846
- That's a legend right there.
- Yeah, man.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.389
Think he's having fun?

16:12.389 --> 16:14.516
Yeah. He's having a great time.
Why are you tripping?

16:14.516 --> 16:17.311
I'm not. I organized
this whole thing. I just-- I don't know.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.646
After you disappeared on him
for five fucking years.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.150
Buddy,
you don't know the whole story of that.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.403
- Can we go for a coffee sometime?
- Here he is.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.613
How'd it go?

16:27.613 --> 16:32.117
Good news. She said, "I'm married, and
even if I wasn't, you're not my type."

16:35.787 --> 16:36.997
Thank you.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.333
- Hello.
- Can I interest anyone in a dessert?

16:39.333 --> 16:40.792
Maybe.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.963
- I actually already bought dessert.
- Oh, damn.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.966
Actually, we might need a few
more minutes with the menu. Thank you.

16:48.842 --> 16:49.676
Okay.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.470
Pass that to Sylvia.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.514
You're not gonna do that
at the table, are you?

16:53.514 --> 16:54.932
I'm not married to the venue.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.684
What's the problem?
You used to love doing a little cocaine.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.520
Once upon a time, I loved cocaine.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.854
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.439
Are you guys having a good time?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.148
Have you tried the broccolini yet?
It's great.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.858
It is so good.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.362
- I'm, like, putting butter on everything.
- I know! Me too.

17:08.362 --> 17:09.863
It's all about an empire waist.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.698
- Am I right?
- Yes! Yeah!

17:12.491 --> 17:15.661
- That's so true. Have fun.
- Yeah.

17:17.246 --> 17:20.082
You just became a completely
different person. That was weird.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.084
Look, I don't make up the rules.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.920
- I don't make up how society works.
- Then break out of your box.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.630
- Do a little nose candy.
- Please don't say that.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.007
- Some Bolivian marching powder.
- Don't say that either.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.552
- Why not? Just dance with the white lady.
- No. I don't--

17:31.552 --> 17:34.847
- Travel down the white line highway?
- Okay. Do you really wanna do that?

17:35.973 --> 17:36.974
Just trying to have fun.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.350
Well, I don't know.

17:38.350 --> 17:42.563
- Change of venue. Let's fucking bail.
- Yes! I love it. Where should we go?

17:42.563 --> 17:46.692
I'm thinking we should go somewhere
a little more festive.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.361
I know. Like an escape room.

17:49.361 --> 17:52.489
I'm thinking more classy.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.616
Piano bar?

17:55.284 --> 17:57.703
He's talking about a strip club,
just so you know.

17:57.703 --> 17:58.787
Really?

17:58.787 --> 18:01.123
I don't know though.
It seems a little too on the nose?

18:01.123 --> 18:02.708
- I mean, maybe it's a little clichÃ©.
- No?

18:02.708 --> 18:03.792
Yeah, totally.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.627
I don't want to ruin the night by maybe

18:05.627 --> 18:08.881
- getting a weird vibe at the strip club.
- Yeah. Let's not ruin the vibe.

18:08.881 --> 18:12.926
Like, I feel like we're gonna have fun
wherever we go, even if it's a strip club.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.511
I for sure wanna keep hanging out.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.890
If we go to another spot and you guys want
to go to an all-nude strip club,

18:17.890 --> 18:20.893
I don't want to be the guy who's like,
"Let's not go to an all-nude strip club."

18:20.893 --> 18:24.646
- So, it's unanimous? Strip club!
- Strip club!

18:25.689 --> 18:27.316
We're going to the strip club.

18:27.316 --> 18:28.692
- There's a song.
- Okay.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.278
- If there's a song, you can't stop him.
- I get it. I--

18:31.278 --> 18:34.281
This might be, I think,
the greatest night I've ever had.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.033
Bro, let's go, dawg.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.619
Let's fucking get
the fuck out of this bitch, bro.

18:42.831 --> 18:48.253
Hey. We need you to be the tiebreaker.
Upscale or a little more down and dirty?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.005
Whichever you prefer.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.050
No. Come on. We want your opinion.
You organized this whole night.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.093
You decide.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.887
I'm happy that I could be of help,

18:56.887 --> 18:59.556
but I think I'm gonna
sit this part of the evening out.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.934
- But you guys go. You go have fun.
- No, come on.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.352
I'm not gonna come, buddy.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.063
- Don't spoil it. Come on.
- What? I'm--

19:06.063 --> 19:08.023
You guys should go.
I just personally don't--

19:08.023 --> 19:10.317
I don't feel like going to a strip club
with a bunch of guys

19:10.317 --> 19:12.152
who really want to go to a strip club.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.947
- There it is.
- What? This is your night.

19:14.947 --> 19:17.366
And if you and your middle-aged friends
wanna go...

19:17.366 --> 19:18.992
- Yeah.
- ...and be entertained by girls

19:18.992 --> 19:21.828
barely older than my daughter,
then you should do it.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.373
Don't make it sound gross.
This is about camaraderie.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.083
Camaraderie was available
in the restaurant.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.252
Why do you care if I'm there?
Why is that important? Go.

19:28.252 --> 19:30.671
- Have fun with your man friends.
- I care 'cause you're talking to me

19:30.671 --> 19:31.797
like I'm a loser.

19:33.465 --> 19:37.427
Okay. Well, then, yeah.
Let's go. Let's go see some tits.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.265
Don't do that, okay? I don't want you
to come if you don't want to come.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.516
What do you want from me?

19:42.516 --> 19:44.726
I want you to want
to go to the strip club.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.938
In a million years,
that will never happen.

19:47.938 --> 19:51.024
- You used to like going to the strip club.
- I was pretending to like that.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.944
You know that. It was when I was 20.
I was trying to be cool and ironic.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.821
I can't stand those places.
They're depressing.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.073
I'm middle-aged now,
and I don't have to pretend anymore.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.617
Well, I feel quite judged right now.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.536
I'm not judging you. I'm really not.

20:02.536 --> 20:05.455
Go and have fun with your friends.
You have my blessing.

20:06.498 --> 20:10.085
- Go forth to the strip club.
- I will go forth.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.837
- Good.
- I'm gonna have a fucking blast.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.506
- I can't wait to hear about it.
- You will be a distant memory.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.550
Just do your thing.

20:17.843 --> 20:18.844
You have to come.

20:18.844 --> 20:21.972
It will be so sad and pathetic

20:21.972 --> 20:25.100
if I am a divorced man at a strip club
with a bunch of frat guys.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.396
If you're there, it's fun and ironic.
Please make this a fun and ironic night.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.981
Please come. I'm begging you.

20:30.981 --> 20:33.358
You have to come.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.612
Close your eyes. Read a fucking book.
I don't care. You have to be there.

20:36.612 --> 20:40.908
I wanted this dinner to be
about your future. About the next chapter.

20:40.908 --> 20:43.535
- I'm not gonna--
- Fuck the future! I don't want the future.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.620
The future is bad.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.456
- You don't know what it holds.
- I know what it holds.

20:47.456 --> 20:51.251
For me, the future is baldness,
testicular cancer and then I die.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.337
Testicular cancer is really
a young man's illness.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.172
It's not something that you should
be concerned--

20:55.172 --> 20:56.298
Now I want it!

20:56.298 --> 20:58.926
Come on. Can't we just
have fun like we used to have?

20:58.926 --> 21:00.886
I'm having fun.
I'm having a different kind of fun.

21:00.886 --> 21:03.305
I'm having fun with my family,
throwing parties for the kids.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.265
Throwing work parties for Charlie.
I have--

21:05.265 --> 21:07.893
Fun has changed for me.
It has evolved into something else.

21:07.893 --> 21:10.938
Your fun has evolved
into something called "not fun."

21:11.522 --> 21:12.606
That's what your fun is.

21:12.606 --> 21:16.026
Look, when do you-- That's all for
other people. When do you get to have fun?

21:16.026 --> 21:19.863
It's very rewarding watching
the people you love have fun.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.116
- That is not true.
- It felt-- I felt that as I said it.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.327
It felt very pathetic. That's your reward?

21:25.327 --> 21:27.371
- We won't go to the strip club.
- Okay.

21:27.371 --> 21:29.081
- Just don't go home.
- Okay.

21:29.081 --> 21:30.874
- Please hang out, okay?
- All right. Well--

21:30.874 --> 21:33.043
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do for fun?

21:33.043 --> 21:34.586
I have one idea.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.591
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

21:40.759 --> 21:44.096
- Oh, yeah. She's back.
- She's back.

21:44.096 --> 21:48.767
She's back.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.894
- Robot's back.
- She is back.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.688
- Hit your robot.
- She is back.

21:53.272 --> 21:54.481
Yo, did they--

21:55.774 --> 21:58.402
Yo, did they have CK back in the day?

21:58.902 --> 22:00.779
- What's CK?
- Cocaine and ketamine.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.948
Well, mostly ketamine
with a little bump of cocaine

22:02.948 --> 22:05.075
- to make it fun for parties.
- Oh, God, dude.

22:05.075 --> 22:08.161
What? What's ketamine?
I don't know what that is.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.456
You do know what it is. Special K.
All the rave kids did it in college.

22:11.456 --> 22:14.585
- What? I didn't sign up to do a rave drug.
- Yeah. I know.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.128
Chill out. Take it easy.

22:16.128 --> 22:18.630
You know, the cocaine
is way more intense than the Special K.

22:18.630 --> 22:22.384
Yeah, the K is nothing. It's just, like,
a mild horse tranquilizer.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.219
It's a horse tranquilizer?

22:24.219 --> 22:26.180
- Sylvia, damn!
- Chill out!

22:26.180 --> 22:27.598
- No, it's okay.
- What?

22:27.598 --> 22:29.766
If this is for horses,
does that mean that they snort it too?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.643
- If it's laced with carrots.
- That's funny.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.770
We gotta get it outta me.
I'm much smaller than a horse.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.273
They use it on small animals too.
I had a gerbil that was prescribed it.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.150
I gotta pump my stomach.
Take me to the hospital?

22:38.150 --> 22:40.569
Take me to the hospital!
They can pump my stomach.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.154
No.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.656
- No! Stop it! Don't do that.
- Sylvia, relax.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.326
It can't-- It doesn't work like that.
It's already in the brain.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.248
Oh, shit.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.918
It's the police.

22:55.918 --> 22:58.003
- Shut up.
- It's the police.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.087
Hi, guys.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.048
- Oh, my God. Fuck, man.
- Fucking Omar.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.591
What are y'all up to in here?

23:02.591 --> 23:04.968
- Omar, close the door, motherfucker.
- Go away.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.470
- Am I'm gonna die?
- You're not gonna die.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.722
- Am I'm gonna get arrested?
- You're not gonna get arrested.

23:08.722 --> 23:09.723
Want me to take you home?

23:09.723 --> 23:13.602
No. I don't wanna go home
to the kids and Charlie on ketamine.

23:13.602 --> 23:15.604
Honestly,
we don't even know what's gonna happen.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.481
It really affects everyone
very differently.

23:17.481 --> 23:20.234
Some people, it hits really hard.
Other people, they barely feel it.

23:24.530 --> 23:25.614
There she goes.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.076
Well, okay.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.081
I think she feels it.

23:34.081 --> 23:38.460
I know I look relaxed.
Well, I'm not relaxed at all.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.424
Shame on you.

23:47.094 --> 23:48.220
I'm very angry.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.016
Livid at you.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.602
- We should get her outta here.
- I'm not happy about this.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.937
No, you don't seem happy.

23:57.563 --> 23:58.689
You look it.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.190
We should keep her moving.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.609
Not a good situation.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.777
Nope. Let's...

24:03.777 --> 24:04.987
Very angry.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.447
- All right. No.
- No?

24:09.366 --> 24:11.076
- Can't believe this.
- Yep.

24:11.076 --> 24:14.079
- I'm furious about this situation.
- S-- Yep.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.164
- I'm good. I'm fine.
- Yeah. You're good.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.750
Sylvia. Hey.

24:18.750 --> 24:22.212
I meant to ask you, are you gonna
sign Maeve up for peewee soccer?

24:22.963 --> 24:24.047
What?

24:24.047 --> 24:26.884
Are you gonna sign
the girls for peewee soccer?

24:26.884 --> 24:28.218
- Yes.
- Yes.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.220
Great.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.931
Which day are you thinking?
Mondays or Wednesdays?

24:34.683 --> 24:35.767
Yes.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.603
Okay. I kno--

24:37.603 --> 24:38.896
Oh, my God.

24:38.896 --> 24:41.523
- Sorry. Oh, dear.
- Wednesdays. That means Wednesdays.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.400
- All right. Are you okay?
- Yep.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.110
- She's okay.
- We'll clean this up for you.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.529
- We'll get you a little Gatorade.
- Get home safe.

24:49.448 --> 24:52.326
You're doing great. There we go.

24:52.326 --> 24:53.911
You're crushing it.

24:53.911 --> 24:56.205
Hanging a left.

24:56.914 --> 24:59.249
On the straightaway. Get you some water.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.627
- Some what?
- Some water.

25:01.627 --> 25:03.170
- Wine?
- No. Water.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.923
- We like wine.
- I know we like wine.

25:06.715 --> 25:08.759
- Ramen.
- Yo, Sylvia's a rager.

25:09.259 --> 25:11.178
Hey, I don't wanna hear
a fucking word out of you.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.305
- This whole thing is your fault.
- You asked for drugs.

25:13.305 --> 25:16.558
And then I brought drugs because
you asked for drugs and this is my fault?

25:16.558 --> 25:19.937
If you present someone
with a little baggie of white powder

25:19.937 --> 25:22.981
and it is not cocaine,
it is on you to disclose that, okay?

25:22.981 --> 25:24.900
That's drug etiquette. This is your fault.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.236
"White powder. It must be cocaine.

25:27.236 --> 25:29.446
I'm Will, and I'm a stockbroker
from the 1980s."

25:29.446 --> 25:31.031
You coming to the booty club
with me or not?

25:31.031 --> 25:33.909
- No.
- Bro, let's go.

25:33.909 --> 25:36.620
It's operation booty club.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.081
- Dude, let's go. Let's get.
- Booty time.

25:39.081 --> 25:40.832
- Come on, booty time!
- Booty time.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.251
Sylvia.

25:44.753 --> 25:47.339
Oh, God! What are you doing?
What happened?

25:48.382 --> 25:50.092
Just-- Let's go. Come on.

25:50.092 --> 25:52.678
I got it. I got the wine. Let's go.

25:53.554 --> 25:55.305
Oh, no. Okay.

25:55.806 --> 25:57.891
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
- What the fuck?

25:58.475 --> 25:59.726
Be careful.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.938
This woman has epilepsy.
Everything's fine. She's fine.

26:04.106 --> 26:06.817
Her vitamins are in the car.
I'm gonna get her out.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.777
I'm calling the cops.

26:08.777 --> 26:13.115
She is a lawyer, and she will sue you
for discrimination against epileptics.

26:13.115 --> 26:15.617
Oh, yeah, right. She's a lawyer.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.077
She's a very brilliant lawyer, okay?

26:17.077 --> 26:18.287
Get her out!

26:18.287 --> 26:19.913
Okay. We're good.

26:20.664 --> 26:22.249
You have a lovely shop.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.385
Hey. There she is.

26:33.385 --> 26:35.679
What-- How long have I been asleep?

26:35.679 --> 26:36.972
Couple of hours.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.146
I can't believe that we used to, like,
take drugs all the time

26:44.146 --> 26:46.273
and then get up in the morning
and take more drugs.

26:46.273 --> 26:48.609
We were-- You know, we were something.

26:48.609 --> 26:50.777
- We were strong.
- We were legendary.

26:51.695 --> 26:53.238
Oh, my God.

26:54.281 --> 26:57.075
Look, I'm really sorry.

26:57.075 --> 27:00.954
You know, you-- You're a normal,
functional adult, my friend.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.332
I'm a stunted loser
with stunted loser friends

27:03.332 --> 27:04.875
who do stunted loser things.

27:04.875 --> 27:06.627
- You know?
- Please.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.838
You want to hear something really stunted?

27:09.838 --> 27:12.466
I would love to
if it makes me feel better. Yes.

27:12.466 --> 27:14.134
- It will.
- Great.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.762
Charlie had to set up
a job interview for me

27:16.762 --> 27:19.223
because I couldn't figure out how
to get one by myself.

27:19.223 --> 27:21.683
That's pretty good. Feeling better.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.185
It's pathetic.

27:23.185 --> 27:25.229
That's not even the worst part.
You know what is?

27:25.229 --> 27:28.190
Is that I'm so insecure
and have such low self-esteem

27:28.190 --> 27:32.986
that I can't even place the call.
I literally can't place the call.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.572
I can't even help myself
crawl out of this hole I'm in.

27:36.365 --> 27:40.494
If you can crawl out of a K-hole,
you can crawl out of any hole.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.163
Mahatma Gandhi said that on his deathbed

27:44.289 --> 27:47.543
and they were like,
"Really? Those are your last words?"

27:47.543 --> 27:51.380
And he was like, "Don't worry. This will--
You'll be glad I said this."

27:53.215 --> 27:55.008
- He was very smart.
- He was a smart guy.

27:57.469 --> 28:02.140
I'm just so terrified of making a decision
and revealing what a loser I am.

28:02.140 --> 28:06.353
You are not a loser, okay? No, not at all.
You threw an amazing divorce party.

28:06.353 --> 28:09.106
- Shut up.
- You did. I had such a good time.

28:09.106 --> 28:12.734
I liked cleaning up after you.
Convincing that lady not to press charges.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.737
- So scary. Very hostile.
- She took that very personally.

28:15.737 --> 28:20.242
But, you know, I didn't think of
my ex-wife for four or five hours.

28:20.242 --> 28:22.286
I can't even remember
the last time that happened.

28:22.286 --> 28:26.456
So, I guess this is me just trying
to say thank you.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.627
No worries, buddy. No worries.

28:31.587 --> 28:34.339
You know what? Fuck it.

28:35.340 --> 28:41.138
I'm so sick of Charlie just harassing me,
and it's time to move on.

28:41.138 --> 28:44.474
What are you doing? Are you doing it?
Are you calling the lawyer?

28:44.474 --> 28:47.978
Yeah. I'm just gonna get it done.
He should be lucky to hear from me.

28:47.978 --> 28:50.772
- I was top of my class at law school.
- It's two o'clock in the morning.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.940
- Hello.
- Oh, no.

28:51.940 --> 28:53.567
- Hello?
- What am I doing? What?

28:53.567 --> 28:56.403
- Why are you doing it? Did it go through?
- I didn't think about that. Oh, my God.

28:57.696 --> 28:59.489
- He's calling me back.
- He's calling you back?

28:59.489 --> 29:04.328
Get rid of it. What do you do?

29:04.328 --> 29:06.496
- Oh, no.
- Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.000
- It went to voice mail.
- Okay.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.293
- No message.
- Okay.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.963
- He's calling again. I can hear it.
- He's calling again. Oh, no.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.132
Oh, no.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.885
This guy wants to know
who called him at 2:00 in the morning.

29:20.761 --> 29:22.429
You're gonna have
to get a new phone number.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.723
- Oh, my God.
- You can't call him from this phone again.

29:24.723 --> 29:26.058
I have to change my number.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.142
But he's calling back.

29:27.142 --> 29:31.647
That means that he's very interested in
whoever called him,

29:32.189 --> 29:34.316
which I would take as a good thing.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.110
Seriously though, thank you for tonight.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.613
I can't even remember that much of it.

29:39.613 --> 29:41.365
I can. I got pictures.

29:41.949 --> 29:44.910
- Look at this. Look at us here.
- That's a terrible photo of me.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.620
- No, it's a great photo.
- Can you delete that?

29:46.620 --> 29:48.288
- It's already been posted.
- That's terrible.

29:48.288 --> 29:50.541
- Do I look really good right now?
- You look very good.

29:50.541 --> 29:53.544
- Right? Pretty. Together.
- You look incredible. You don't--

29:53.544 --> 29:56.255
You don't look like
you've been in a tornado.

29:57.089 --> 29:58.507
Having the time of your life.

29:58.507 --> 29:59.591
Wow.

30:01.218 --> 30:02.052
Cheers.

30:02.052 --> 30:04.263
To the future.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.431
- To the future.
- Need oil.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.784
<i>Hey, I had fun the other night.</i>

30:25.784 --> 30:28.871
<i>Let me know if I can
take you out to dinner sometime.</i>

30:32.249 --> 30:34.459
<i>Yeah. Dinner is one of my favorite meals.</i>

30:36.962 --> 30:39.548
<i>Are you surprised
I responded at this hour?</i>

<i>No. Not at all.</i>

30:42.509 --> 30:45.095

30:45.762 --> 30:47.389

30:49.433 --> 30:51.518
<i>I'm surprised you know how

30:51.518 --> 30:53.854
<i>Well, I am full of surprises.</i>

30:55.022 --> 30:56.648
<i>I fully doubt that.</i>
