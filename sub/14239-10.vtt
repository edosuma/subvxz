WEBVTT

00:02.559 --> 00:06.519
Torchwood, outside the government,
beyond the police.

00:06.554 --> 00:08.845
Tracking down alien life on earth,

00:08.880 --> 00:11.884
arming the human race
against the future.

00:11.919 --> 00:15.040
The 21st century is when
everything changes...

00:15.075 --> 00:16.484
and you've got to be ready.

00:16.519 --> 00:20.999
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.000 --> 01:25.519
Hello there.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.320
Apologies for the unplanned touchdown,
just hit some rotten turbulence.

01:33.355 --> 01:35.160
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.884
Diane Holmes, pilot.

01:36.919 --> 01:39.119
Is this some sort of secret base?

01:39.154 --> 01:41.284
You must show me round one day.

01:41.319 --> 01:44.320
Everything all right?
How long before we head off again?

01:44.355 --> 01:47.440
My Uncle's expecting me.
When did you leave?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.519
About half an hour ago. Which date?

01:51.119 --> 01:53.599
Today, December the 18th.
Which year?

01:55.159 --> 01:58.280
Which year?
Which year? I need to know.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.879
1953.

02:17.319 --> 02:19.759
There's no need to be frightened.

02:19.794 --> 02:22.324
Who are you exactly?

02:22.359 --> 02:24.679
The least you know about us,
the better.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.860
Meet the team. Toshiko.

02:28.895 --> 02:31.320
Gwen. Doctor Owen Harper.

02:31.355 --> 02:33.085
John Ellis.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.359
Emma Louise Cowell.

02:35.394 --> 02:36.965
Diane Holmes.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.880
Please, follow me.

02:48.399 --> 02:50.800
At least it wasn't a spaceship
full of aliens.

02:50.835 --> 02:52.445
That might have been easier.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.845
But how can you travel
50 years in half an hour?

02:54.880 --> 02:59.720
Your aircraft slipped through a transcendental
portal. A what? A door in time and space.

02:59.755 --> 03:04.159
It's some kind of trick,
it has to be. Tosh?

03:06.120 --> 03:10.600
Celebrations of the Millennium
in your respective home cities,

03:10.635 --> 03:14.165
photographs documenting the
development of Cardiff Bay

03:14.200 --> 03:18.360
from the '50s to the present day,
blueprints of modern day aeroplanes.

03:18.395 --> 03:20.485
But if all this is true...

03:20.520 --> 03:23.685
then how do we get back? You don't.

03:23.720 --> 03:29.200
According to history, your plane
never returned. I'm sorry.

03:29.235 --> 03:30.959
What's going to happen to us?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.404
Never mind about us.

03:35.439 --> 03:38.400
What happened to everyone else?

03:38.435 --> 03:39.879
Our families.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.040
Your father died in 1959. He was 48.

03:47.075 --> 03:48.964
Dad said he'd die young.

03:48.999 --> 03:51.239
All the men in the
munitions factory did.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.480
Your mother lived
till she was 81 though.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.200
I know this is hard to take in.
But is there anyone else?

03:58.235 --> 04:00.044
My son, Alan Ellis.

04:00.079 --> 04:06.279
He was born on the 6th of April,
1937, 14 Park Place, Grangetown.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.444
He might still be alive.

04:08.479 --> 04:11.840
The archives in the '50s
weren't that well documented.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.364
We'll try again tomorrow.

04:13.399 --> 04:16.119
Right now,
you need to get some sleep.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.057
Friends?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.925
Boyfriend?

04:19.959 --> 04:23.040
Not really. Never stayed
in one place long enough.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.844
It's a bit basic.

04:44.879 --> 04:46.720
Not when you've slept in barracks.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.560
I was going to close a deal
on a shop in Dublin tomorrow.

04:58.595 --> 05:01.484
What do you trade in?

05:01.519 --> 05:04.320
Food, knick-knacks, essentials.

05:09.079 --> 05:12.725
What are you after? Bit of music.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.960
RADIO PLAYS
BEETHOVEN'S MOONLIGHT SONATA

05:21.079 --> 05:24.439
There's photographs
of my family in here.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.284
I'll see what I can do.

05:26.319 --> 05:28.539
Don't worry, Captain Harkness,

05:28.574 --> 05:30.759
I'll look after the ladies.

05:30.794 --> 05:33.644
Call me Jack.

05:33.679 --> 05:36.919
DISTANT LAUGHING
Who else is here?

05:36.954 --> 05:40.159
Couple of young girls. Pretty dress.

05:40.194 --> 05:42.977
Thank you. I made it myself.

05:43.012 --> 05:45.725
Where are you from? Bristol.

05:45.760 --> 05:50.760
What were you going to Dublin for? Auntie Nora's
ill and Uncle Finn can't manage the children.

05:50.795 --> 05:55.400
It will be good practice for when
I have children of my own, Mum says.

06:02.839 --> 06:06.120
She's gone next door
so Uncle Finn can telephone...

06:07.719 --> 06:09.439
She'll know I'm missing by now.

06:12.519 --> 06:16.085
Emma, she found out in 1953.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.119
Over 50 years have passed, remember?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.039
What will she think happened?

06:31.039 --> 06:34.840
It must have been like one of those
murders where they never find the body.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.040
They seemed to think the plane
went down in the sea.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.445
These will be your means
of identification.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.204
We've set up bank accounts for you
but we'll give you

06:56.239 --> 07:00.640
an allowance so you can practice with the
currency and money management. David Ward.

07:00.675 --> 07:02.204
Sally-Anne Hope.

07:02.239 --> 07:05.999
Deborah Morrison, and it's
spelt how Deborah Kerr spells it.

07:06.034 --> 07:09.400
Your background stories
should incorporate your skills.

07:09.435 --> 07:11.724
John, you could have run
a corner shop.

07:11.759 --> 07:15.119
No. We can fake references.
You can't take away our names.

07:15.154 --> 07:17.239
For God's sake,
it's all we've got left.

07:17.274 --> 07:19.165
It's my son's name,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.520
it's the name above my shop.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.604
You're right.

07:31.639 --> 07:34.080
I didn't think.
You should keep your name.

07:36.680 --> 07:42.400
I'd suggest you use £25 for your food and then
£20 for luxuries like cigarettes, magazines.

07:42.435 --> 07:44.405
My dad only made £10 a week!

07:44.440 --> 07:46.279
Things are a lot more expensive now.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.479
How did it do that? It's automatic.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.684
It knows you're there. But how?

07:55.719 --> 08:00.439
There are wave bouncing detectors which emit
radio waves and then look for reflections...

08:00.474 --> 08:04.320
Bananas! Of course,
bananas are far more interesting.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.445
Look at all this!

08:07.480 --> 08:09.919
We'd just come off rationing in '53.

08:09.954 --> 08:12.359
Yes, sorry,
we are a consumer society.

08:12.394 --> 08:14.279
It's bloody fantastic.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.880
How much food money have I got left?
£15.40.

08:40.279 --> 08:42.720
£12.10. You'll ruin your teeth.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.280
You sound like my mum.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.840
They sell films in boxes
and you can watch them at home.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.840
I love going to the pictures.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.404
Good God.

08:57.439 --> 09:01.240
Welcome to the wonderful world
of scantily-dressed celebrities.

09:01.275 --> 09:04.497
"Super Excel Waterproof
Luscious Lashes Mascara".

09:04.532 --> 09:07.720
I've got to have that.
There's children around.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.200
She's a children's TV presenter.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.799
So you like the musicals?
My best friend, Kate, and I

09:15.834 --> 09:18.400
saw Calamity Jane five times.
I've got the LP.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.124
You all right?

09:28.159 --> 09:30.160
What does that mean?

09:33.079 --> 09:36.480
I'm just going to take a look
at the stadium.

09:36.515 --> 09:38.520
You girls stick together now.

09:38.555 --> 09:39.960
I'll be back for supper.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.559
Excuse me. Do you know a man called
Alan Ellis? He used to live here.

10:04.594 --> 10:06.759
No, sorry, mate.

10:17.999 --> 10:20.520
I'm going to check on the plane
this afternoon.

10:20.555 --> 10:22.405
Want to come?

10:22.440 --> 10:25.644
I'm going to watch this.

10:25.679 --> 10:27.759
And maybe make some paper chains.

10:30.079 --> 10:32.760
Wonder what work
I can get in aviation.

10:35.279 --> 10:37.240
I'm going to have to find a husband.

10:38.959 --> 10:41.159
LAUGHTER

10:48.680 --> 10:52.839
All right?
I'm Alesha, this is Jade. All right.

10:52.874 --> 10:55.964
I'm Emma. Diane.

10:55.999 --> 10:58.680
Excuse me, have to get ready.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.559
Where d'you get those shoes?
They're lush.

11:09.594 --> 11:10.999
Thanks.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.219
Hello, old girl,

11:17.254 --> 11:19.404
d'you miss me?

11:19.439 --> 11:22.325
I've been reading up on you.

11:22.360 --> 11:27.879
England to Australia in four days,
1952, that is impressive.

11:27.914 --> 11:30.319
Yeah, terrible wind
across the Bengal Bay.

11:30.354 --> 11:31.759
Something you ate?

11:35.759 --> 11:38.219
So, how did you get into this?

11:38.254 --> 11:40.645
Ferried planes during the war.

11:40.680 --> 11:45.519
Of course, when it was over, we were supposed
to revert to being dutiful wives and daughters.

11:45.554 --> 11:48.999
But I'd got the taste for it. No
pig-headed man tells me what to do.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.804
Ah.

11:50.839 --> 11:53.725
"Sky Gipsy"?

11:53.760 --> 11:56.364
After the engine.

11:56.399 --> 12:00.964
The de Havilland Gipsy Six -
a work of genius.

12:00.999 --> 12:05.359
Tuned with a higher compression ratio to
squeeze more energy from its fuel mixture.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.524
Can I take her up?

12:09.559 --> 12:13.039
No, you could get arrested.
You haven't got a licence.

12:13.074 --> 12:14.525
But I...

12:14.560 --> 12:18.120
Bugger, it's no longer valid.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.440
I guess I'm just another
pig-headed man

12:22.475 --> 12:24.679
telling you what to do.

12:26.239 --> 12:29.044
Well, you'd better make it up to me.

12:29.079 --> 12:32.684
I want to learn
all about this new world.

12:32.719 --> 12:36.439
Blackpool were 3-1 down, then
Stanley Matthews worked his magic -

12:36.474 --> 12:39.520
scored two goals
in the last 20 minutes.

12:39.555 --> 12:41.804
Bolton lost 4-3.

12:41.839 --> 12:45.039
My boy was on his knees,
punching the air...

12:45.074 --> 12:48.204
The FA cup final
live in my own living room.

12:48.239 --> 12:50.959
I charged the lads a shilling each
to come and watch.

12:50.994 --> 12:52.600
Ever the business man, eh, John?

12:57.559 --> 12:59.759
That's an American accent, isn't it?

12:59.794 --> 13:02.165
That's right.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.604
So how did you end up here,

13:04.639 --> 13:07.400
doing whatever it is that you do?

13:07.435 --> 13:08.479
It's a long story.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.559
I'm a slow drinker.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.199
You know everything about me.
What's the problem?

13:17.234 --> 13:19.320
Gets kinda complicated.

13:22.319 --> 13:24.160
What, did you fall through time too?

13:28.600 --> 13:32.520
Yeah, you could say that.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.200
Sorry, mate,
you can't smoke in here.

13:52.279 --> 13:54.160
What are you doing Christmas Eve?

13:54.195 --> 13:55.920
We could go carol singing.

13:56.999 --> 13:59.244
THEY ALL LAUGH

13:59.279 --> 14:02.159
I'll be getting hammered.
Where are your families?

14:02.194 --> 14:05.039
No idea. We grew up in care.

14:05.074 --> 14:08.005
Like a children's home?

14:08.040 --> 14:10.200
I haven't got anyone else either.

14:10.235 --> 14:13.525
What happened to you?

14:13.560 --> 14:18.520
My parents are dead,
so I came down here to start afresh.

14:18.555 --> 14:21.079
So they didn't leave you
a house or anything?

14:22.639 --> 14:24.120
No.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.084
I've got nothing.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.319
Were you close to them?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.839
Yes.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.999
I loved them very much.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.799
Must have been an awful Christmas
for them, thinking I'd drowned.

15:00.834 --> 15:05.080
I just want to know
what kind of life he had, my son.

15:05.115 --> 15:07.684
He might have kids.

15:07.719 --> 15:11.320
I could be passing my own
flesh and blood in the street.

15:11.355 --> 15:13.244
Find him, Jack,

15:13.279 --> 15:14.799
he's all I've got left.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.919
Cheers.

15:27.679 --> 15:31.119
What? I'm waiting for you
to pull out my chair.

15:32.719 --> 15:37.364
Let me get this straight.
You expect equality AND chivalry?

15:37.399 --> 15:42.079
I don't see why they should be mutually
exclusive. Well, if it makes you happy.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.159
Your chair, ma'am.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.920
Thank you.

16:06.319 --> 16:09.124
So what other strides
have women made?

16:09.159 --> 16:12.645
Well, on the strange but true,
how about this,

16:12.680 --> 16:16.645
you don't have to have sex
to have kids any more. What?

16:16.680 --> 16:22.360
How come? Get yourself inseminated, with
a sort of syringe, cheery little process.

16:22.395 --> 16:26.217
Seriously,
men donate sperm anonymously.

16:26.252 --> 16:30.040
A little shuffle into a pot
at a sperm bank.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.285
And they say romance is dead.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.319
Oh, come on,
I wasn't born yesterday.

16:35.354 --> 16:38.319
No, but for a bird who's going on 90

16:38.354 --> 16:41.484
you look pretty hot.

16:41.519 --> 16:43.084
What was your favourite song?

16:43.119 --> 16:45.485
Well, it's hard to say.
I know what mine was.

16:45.520 --> 16:50.719
# I just blew in from the windy city
The windy city is mighty pretty

16:50.754 --> 16:56.640
# But they ain't got what we got
I'm tellin' ya, boys! #

16:56.675 --> 16:59.277
What do you think you're playing at?

16:59.312 --> 17:01.879
I thought I could trust you
to behave.

17:03.679 --> 17:05.118
Where do you want to go now?

17:06.799 --> 17:09.644
Well, I'm in your hands.

17:09.679 --> 17:12.284
Well, we could go back to mine.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.480
You could read up
about yourself on the net.

17:15.515 --> 17:17.684
That sounds like a line.

17:17.719 --> 17:20.079
It's not a line,
I'm not chatting you up.

17:20.114 --> 17:22.405
Not because I don't think you're
attractive,

17:22.440 --> 17:27.000
but because I wouldn't want you to think I
was taking advantage of you. Got any Scotch?

17:27.035 --> 17:30.319
I don't see why she got you
involved. She was upset.

17:30.354 --> 17:32.885
She was drinking.
I only had half a glass.

17:32.920 --> 17:37.800
Enough to make a show of yourself. We're
not meant to draw attention to ourselves.

17:37.835 --> 17:40.079
We're not the same as them.

17:40.114 --> 17:42.244
We can't trust anyone.

17:42.279 --> 17:47.519
Will you be OK now, Emma? Don't worry,
I won't let her out of my sight again.

17:47.554 --> 17:52.759
I don't like liver. Sit down, young lady,
and be grateful for what you're given.

17:52.794 --> 17:54.565
And why should I listen to you?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.799
Emma? Only my dad
gets to talk to me like that...

17:57.834 --> 18:00.919
and I'm never going
to see him again, am I?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.924
Or my mum,

18:02.959 --> 18:04.964
or my best friend,

18:04.999 --> 18:10.444
or my dog and I miss them...

18:10.479 --> 18:13.359
and I hate this filthy,
stinking place!

18:20.560 --> 18:23.640
I never had this sort of trouble
with my son.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.459
Woman have been to space too, y'know.

18:35.494 --> 18:38.239
You've got a lot of
catching up to do.

18:38.274 --> 18:40.405
Do you have a girlfriend? No.

18:40.440 --> 18:46.039
So who do all those beauty
products belong to? Me, actually.

18:46.074 --> 18:47.919
No?

18:50.959 --> 18:54.439
Oi, real men can moisturize too,
you know.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.239
It's not very homely here.

19:03.399 --> 19:07.920
No, I'm not here that much,
it doesn't seem worth the effort.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.439
You smoke too much.

19:19.474 --> 19:20.879
So I gather.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.805
Amelia Earhart...

19:24.840 --> 19:27.685
she disappeared in 1932.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.120
Do you think she's
still out there somewhere?

19:30.155 --> 19:31.724
No, doubt it.

19:31.759 --> 19:35.359
One in a zillion chance,
you ending up here.

19:36.919 --> 19:38.400
A whole new world.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.840
Oh, it's not so bad,

19:42.875 --> 19:44.520
once you get used to it.

19:49.519 --> 19:52.719
I reckon you'll fit in just fine.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.559
I'm glad you haven't got
a girlfriend.

20:10.639 --> 20:12.200
Me too.

20:13.519 --> 20:18.079
#.. Come around
and knock me down again

20:18.114 --> 20:20.239
# Worry

20:22.319 --> 20:27.160
# Oh, worry, worry, worry,
worry... #

20:35.320 --> 20:37.440
I take it that
wasn't your first time?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.739
I had a lover.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.404
He was married.

20:43.439 --> 20:45.565
And you didn't care?

20:45.600 --> 20:48.004
Well, I was free to do what I liked

20:48.039 --> 20:51.619
and I didn't have to cook
and clean for him.

20:51.654 --> 20:55.200
It suited me.
I'm not exactly marriage material.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.820
I always thought the '50s were

21:00.855 --> 21:03.560
uptight, sexually repressed and...

21:06.679 --> 21:09.800
You didn't invent it, you know. Oh?!

21:12.559 --> 21:14.859
Can we do it again?

21:14.894 --> 21:17.160
Don't see why not.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.800
We could have an affair.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.839
We could be fuck buddies.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.880
What's a fuck buddy?

21:29.915 --> 21:32.005
It's, um,

21:32.040 --> 21:34.519
it's a friend that
you have casual sex with.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.759
There's nothing casual
about what we just did.

21:40.794 --> 21:42.520
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.

21:42.555 --> 21:44.239
Sex shouldn't be devalued.

21:47.640 --> 21:52.000
Both parties should give it
100% concentration.

21:57.319 --> 21:59.400
Because when you
take off together...

22:03.560 --> 22:06.199
It's the next best thing to flying.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.839
SHE SCREAMS

22:37.679 --> 22:40.765
Emma is my auntie's step-daughter.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.525
She meant to spend Christmas in
Cardiff with a friend

22:43.560 --> 22:50.040
but they had this awful argument last night
and she rang me. Got my number from Mum.

22:50.075 --> 22:54.077
The thing is, she doesn't really
want to go back home so I thought...

22:54.112 --> 22:58.080
I thought maybe, she could stay with
us. We've got a lot to catch up on.

22:58.115 --> 23:02.520
For Christmas?
GWEN MOUTHS

23:05.960 --> 23:08.805
I'd better get a bigger turkey.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.760
Thanks. This is Rhys,
my long-suffering boyfriend.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.879
He lives here.
Don't your parents mind?

23:16.914 --> 23:19.239
Emma's parents are a bit religious.

23:20.840 --> 23:24.079
Oh, better not tell them
you saw my morning glory then, eh?

23:29.839 --> 23:32.719
The thing is I couldn't tell him
your parents were dead.

23:32.754 --> 23:35.244
He'd ask too many questions.

23:35.279 --> 23:38.200
The thing is, he doesn't know
exactly what I do.

23:42.559 --> 23:45.079
We can't expect John and Diane
to look after her.

23:45.114 --> 23:47.365
They're strangers.
I had to take her in.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.839
Diane didn't even come home last
night. I think she was in a B&B.

23:50.874 --> 23:52.920
I'll take her job-hunting later.

23:52.955 --> 23:54.725
Jack, John's son.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.679
I think I've found him.

23:58.560 --> 24:02.759
Come and meet Alan, though I'm not
sure how much help he'll be to you.

24:14.639 --> 24:17.039
Alan,
there's someone here to see you.

24:17.074 --> 24:19.404
He's a nephew on your father's side.

24:19.439 --> 24:21.839
He's been tracking down
the family history.

24:21.874 --> 24:24.317
Is Sally coming?

24:24.352 --> 24:26.725
Sally's his wife.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.965
She passed away a while back.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.399
Sorry, this isn't
one of his better days.

24:32.434 --> 24:34.039
What's wrong with him?

24:34.074 --> 24:36.125
Alzheimer's.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.845
What's that? He's senile.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.564
He doesn't remember who he is
most of the time.

24:41.599 --> 24:46.560
Couldn't live at home any more. He'd
leave hobs on, forget to dress, you know.

24:46.595 --> 24:50.680
He never had any children so there
was no-one there to look after him.

24:59.959 --> 25:03.720
That's you and your dad
playing footie out the back.

25:07.560 --> 25:11.760
That's your dad and your mum
and your new television set.

25:11.795 --> 25:13.685
When can I go home?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.364
You're not well enough, love.

25:15.399 --> 25:18.365
I don't like it here.
They took my clothes.

25:18.400 --> 25:22.759
I'll have a word, they're in the
wash. Keeps me going, this one.

25:22.794 --> 25:25.004
What did he do, for a living?

25:25.039 --> 25:29.440
Was he in retail?
I think he was a fireman.

25:29.475 --> 25:30.959
That's what I did.

25:30.994 --> 25:33.439
In the war.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.360
£60 for half an hour!

25:41.395 --> 25:43.480
No worries. I'll pay.

25:43.515 --> 25:45.365
A Cessna!

25:45.400 --> 25:47.324
Oh, it's my first plane.

25:47.359 --> 25:51.040
I bought one after the war,
they've hardly changed.

25:51.075 --> 25:52.925
Dream to fly.

25:52.960 --> 25:57.439
We'll soon get you back
behind the... throttle.

25:57.474 --> 25:58.920
Thanks, Owen.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.779
Matthews did three set-ups
in 20 minutes,

26:04.814 --> 26:08.364
then Bill Perry
cracked home the winner.

26:08.399 --> 26:13.399
You said he had wings on his feet
and that's why he was called a winger.

26:13.434 --> 26:17.599
You used to say clever
things like that. Blackpool won.

26:17.634 --> 26:19.484
Yes!

26:19.519 --> 26:22.564
Alan, it's me, your dad.

26:22.599 --> 26:27.439
I bought you that football annual
you wanted for Christmas, Alan.

26:27.474 --> 26:29.280
It was in my desk drawer.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.040
Alan, please...

26:34.080 --> 26:36.125
Everything all right?

26:36.160 --> 26:39.640
He remembered who won the FA Cup
final when he was a boy.

26:39.675 --> 26:43.200
He sometimes remembers
snippets from his childhood.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.680
It's quite common with dementia.

26:46.715 --> 26:48.877
When's Dad coming, Mum?

26:48.912 --> 26:51.040
I'm not your mum, love.

26:51.075 --> 26:52.600
Alan?

26:57.320 --> 26:59.080
Who are you?

27:03.199 --> 27:06.520
John's witnessing the end of
his world, the end of his line.

27:06.555 --> 27:08.324
And we can't help.

27:08.359 --> 27:12.364
There's no puzzle to solve,
no enemy to fight...

27:12.399 --> 27:16.120
just three lost people who have
somehow become our responsibility.

27:24.039 --> 27:27.139
Best I can do is Friday 29th,
three o'clock.

27:27.174 --> 27:30.205
Can't you take her up today?
Fully booked.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.079
It's all right, I've flown
for years. I can go on my own.

27:33.114 --> 27:34.937
Not without a licence, sorry.

27:34.972 --> 27:36.725
Maybe you could cancel someone?

27:36.760 --> 27:39.560
We'll pay extra. I couldn't
do that do my regulars.

27:39.595 --> 27:41.799
Look, it's fine.
Book me in for the 29th.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.765
It's Diane Holmes.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.360
Diane, I'm really sorry.
I should have called ahead.

27:48.395 --> 27:50.520
Oh, for goodness' sake,
this is so silly.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.200
It's just I was
really looking forward...

27:55.235 --> 27:57.039
Ignore me. Let's get out of here.

27:59.559 --> 28:01.600
"I See You Baby"
by Groove Armada

28:12.319 --> 28:14.684
Do you think
she'll be all right though?

28:14.719 --> 28:17.959
I don't think she's even had a proper
boyfriend. Stop fussing.

28:17.994 --> 28:19.320
She'll be fine, man.

28:25.359 --> 28:27.005
What was that for?

28:27.040 --> 28:30.159
For putting up with me.
I deserve a lot more for doing that.

29:09.199 --> 29:12.085
Oi! Hands off!
Go back to your friends, good boy.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.284
What are you playing at?
I wouldn't let him do anything.

29:15.319 --> 29:18.919
You might not have had much choice.
Gwen, you're over-reacting.

29:18.954 --> 29:21.480
I was just having a kiss
and a cuddle.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.480
He was after a lot more than that.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.525
This is... disgusting.

29:29.560 --> 29:34.319
I just want you to know that people
are more sexually aware these days.

29:34.354 --> 29:36.964
Then maybe you'll be more careful.

29:36.999 --> 29:40.979
Mum said that no man wants to marry
soiled goods. Attitudes have changed.

29:41.014 --> 29:44.959
As long as it's safe and between
two consenting adults, no-one cares.

29:46.519 --> 29:51.399
So... how many men have you
done it with?

29:54.120 --> 29:56.684
A few.

29:56.719 --> 29:59.485
Were you in love with all of them?

29:59.520 --> 30:03.485
No. Sex can just be about
having a good time together.

30:03.520 --> 30:07.639
If you're in the right mood, with the
right guy, it's the best, no big deal.

30:07.674 --> 30:10.484
So if I meet a boy and we get on,

30:10.519 --> 30:14.199
and he wants sex,
then you think I should let him?

30:14.234 --> 30:17.880
No, no, that's not what I said.
What are you saying?

30:17.915 --> 30:21.800
Sex... is nothing to be ashamed of.

30:23.559 --> 30:27.080
And as for you, well, your first
time should be with someone special.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.340
Do you wish you'd waited for Rhys?

30:31.375 --> 30:33.960
He's your special someone, isn't he?

30:33.995 --> 30:36.004
Yes... Yes, I suppose.

30:36.039 --> 30:39.079
And I bet sex with him
is better than with the others.

30:39.114 --> 30:40.519
Well...

30:43.200 --> 30:47.084
I will wait for Mr Right, I think.

30:47.119 --> 30:49.800
I'm really not the kind of girl
who sleeps around.

30:51.759 --> 30:54.759
I'm going to brush my teeth.

30:54.794 --> 30:56.479
Thanks for the chat.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.879
Not a problem.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.445
Leave it.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.245
I can't if I want to fly
a jet plane,

31:15.280 --> 31:18.685
because that's all flying is now -
pressing buttons.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.480
You used to have to know how to fix
an engine, how to gauge the wind but...

31:22.515 --> 31:24.717
Leave it.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.920
Open this.

31:36.919 --> 31:38.400
Oh!

31:42.160 --> 31:43.639
It's beautiful.

31:54.880 --> 32:01.240
Well, how did it go? This coat I'm wearing
is their latest fashion, '50s inspired.

32:01.275 --> 32:05.999
They offered me a job on the spot.
Oh, that's brilliant. Oh!

32:06.034 --> 32:08.440
Now we need to find you a flat
near here.

32:08.475 --> 32:10.964
The shop's in a new branch in London.

32:10.999 --> 32:14.124
I've always dreamt about
working in a London fashion house.

32:14.159 --> 32:18.199
They open the day after Boxing Day.
I'll be a shop girl and a trainee buyer.

32:18.234 --> 32:20.485
I can house share. They've given me
numbers.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.760
London's a big city.
That's what my mum used to say.

32:23.795 --> 32:26.637
There's no rush.
There's nothing to keep me here.

32:26.672 --> 32:29.480
I'm sure we can find you
something in Cardiff.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.959
You keep looking.

32:37.679 --> 32:42.279
Need to make a plan, get work,
get my driving licence.

32:42.314 --> 32:44.119
It will all help. Thanks, Jack.

33:04.559 --> 33:06.724
I was looking for a bus timetable.

33:06.759 --> 33:10.159
Want to get out to the DIY stores,
see if there's any work going.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.359
Best of luck! Thank you.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.519
Where are you taking me?

33:31.554 --> 33:33.556
We're here.

33:33.591 --> 33:35.559
Bear with me.

33:42.440 --> 33:46.840
We have had such a girly day
shopping.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.399
What's up?

33:56.434 --> 33:58.399
Your mum rang.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.319
Funny thing,
she's no idea who Emma is.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.719
No? And I'm thinking back
to you and me on the couch...

34:08.754 --> 34:11.800
Work calls, you go out
in the middle of the night

34:11.835 --> 34:13.844
and come back with
a surprise relative.

34:13.879 --> 34:18.279
So, let's have it,
who exactly is Pollyanna?

34:18.313 --> 34:20.976
Ah, is it to do with work?

34:21.012 --> 34:23.639
It's so hard to explain.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.559
Do you even know her?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.920
She was lost.

34:32.955 --> 34:35.205
I'm sorry.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.998
What worries me is how easy it is
for you to lie to me.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.839
It's my fault.
I'll leave by tomorrow.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.199
You don't have to go.
She's 18 years old.

34:46.235 --> 34:47.839
I couldn't turn my back on her.

34:52.279 --> 34:55.239
It's like two separate worlds -

34:55.274 --> 34:57.164
there's Torchwood,

34:57.199 --> 34:58.799
and then there's real life.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.400
That's why you've got to let me go.

35:12.840 --> 35:19.200
I, er, couldn't help noticing you
standing out here in that beautiful dress.

35:19.235 --> 35:22.857
This beautiful dress
is a gift from my lover.

35:22.892 --> 35:26.479
Then he is a fool
to let you go out in it alone.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.960
What shall we drink to?

35:33.995 --> 35:35.439
Chance meetings.

35:40.080 --> 35:46.799
# Oh, the good life

35:46.834 --> 35:48.565
# Full of fun

35:48.600 --> 35:51.879
# Seems to be the ideal

35:57.439 --> 35:59.965
# Mm, the good life

36:00.000 --> 36:05.119
# Lets you hide
all the sadness you feel

36:11.280 --> 36:15.840
# You won't really fall in love

36:15.875 --> 36:20.400
# For you can't take the chance

36:24.280 --> 36:27.000
# So please be honest

36:28.560 --> 36:31.480
# With yourself... #

36:31.515 --> 36:33.799
Let's go home.

36:37.479 --> 36:41.520
# It's the good life

36:41.555 --> 36:44.365
# To be free

36:44.400 --> 36:47.599
# And explore the unknown... #

36:51.319 --> 36:53.405
MOBILE RINGS

36:53.440 --> 36:56.524
# Like the heart aches

36:56.559 --> 37:01.759
# When you learn
you must face them alone... #

37:01.794 --> 37:02.845
Hello?

37:02.880 --> 37:04.484
My car keys are missing.

37:04.519 --> 37:08.040
John was behind the counter
earlier on

37:08.075 --> 37:10.519
and I can't get hold of him.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.480
He's gone home.

37:42.159 --> 37:43.639
John!

37:56.040 --> 37:57.519
John!

38:02.760 --> 38:05.764
Let me go!

38:05.799 --> 38:08.444
You can't just throw it away,
not without trying.

38:08.479 --> 38:13.199
I'm not as strong as you. You don't
understand. I do. I was born in the future.

38:13.234 --> 38:15.960
Lived in your past.
My time is gone too.

38:15.995 --> 38:17.445
Why are you doing this?

38:17.480 --> 38:19.325
Speaking to me in bloody riddles,

38:19.360 --> 38:24.725
keeping me here when my wife
is dead, my son is a shell.

38:24.760 --> 38:29.760
John, you're still young. You can get
work, make friends, start a family.

38:29.795 --> 38:31.879
I did all that, Jack.

38:31.914 --> 38:33.725
Years ago.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.400
When I was meant to.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.760
I wish I could say something.
There's nothing to say or do.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.759
I can't leave you here.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.316
Then we'll wait.

39:42.351 --> 39:44.804
The sun will rise,

39:44.839 --> 39:47.439
we'll have some breakfast,

39:47.474 --> 39:49.159
take a walk.

39:49.194 --> 39:51.525
Yes.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.284
A new day.

39:53.319 --> 39:58.360
And I'll suffer it all
and smile and wag my tail.

39:58.395 --> 40:01.080
And then,
as soon as your back is turned,

40:01.115 --> 40:04.165
I'll make sure I do it properly.

40:04.200 --> 40:09.760
Because I want to die.
You don't get reunited, John.

40:09.795 --> 40:11.677
It just goes black.

40:11.712 --> 40:13.956
How do you know?

40:13.991 --> 40:16.165
I died once.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.084
Who are you? A man,

40:19.119 --> 40:22.200
like you, out of his time,

40:24.879 --> 40:27.399
alone and scared.

40:27.434 --> 40:29.417
How do you cope?

40:29.452 --> 40:31.400
It's just bearable.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.405
It has to be.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.519
I don't have a choice.

40:37.554 --> 40:39.084
But I do.

40:39.119 --> 40:40.960
If you want to help me,

40:42.559 --> 40:44.640
let me go with some dignity.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.000
Don't condemn me to live.

40:53.199 --> 40:55.239
Are you scared?

40:56.840 --> 40:58.319
Yes.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.319
You're very quiet.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.719
I don't know if I can

41:11.754 --> 41:13.160
do this anymore.

41:16.039 --> 41:18.925
This isn't how it works for me.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.280
I've slept with enough women,
I've done the fuck buddies thing.

41:23.839 --> 41:25.320
This is not it.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.160
I can't concentrate.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.519
All I see is you,

41:38.120 --> 41:41.284
all I can think about
is what you're wearing,

41:41.319 --> 41:46.399
what you're thinking, what your face
looks like when you come.

41:49.199 --> 41:52.839
It's been, what, a week?

41:56.199 --> 42:00.799
And it's like,
when I'm not with you,

42:03.560 --> 42:06.319
um, I'm out of focus.

42:11.079 --> 42:13.120
How have you done this to me?

42:17.119 --> 42:18.600
I'm scared.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.600
I'm fucking scared.

42:30.799 --> 42:32.479
I love you too.

43:04.399 --> 43:07.325
The thing about love...

43:07.360 --> 43:09.480
is that you're always
at its mercy.

43:50.159 --> 43:51.925
Emma, these are your tickets, OK?

43:51.960 --> 43:55.559
On the back is your seat number,
keep this with you at all times.

43:55.594 --> 43:57.924
I've also got you
a return just in case.

43:57.959 --> 44:03.360
Now don't go talking to any strangers
and phone me as soon as you get there, OK?

44:25.839 --> 44:28.524
No!

44:28.559 --> 44:31.719
I'm not letting you do this.
I'm not a possession, Owen.

44:31.754 --> 44:34.124
You can't do this, it's madness.

44:34.159 --> 44:38.359
If I listened to everyone who told me
that, I wouldn't have broken any records.

44:40.080 --> 44:44.640
You don't have to go. If I don't,
then I'll always wonder what it's like.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.079
London, Gwen.

45:08.079 --> 45:10.764
You're not thinking straight,
let's talk about it.

45:10.799 --> 45:14.359
No, I'm sorry. We can make this
work. You belong here now, with me.

45:14.394 --> 45:17.119
I belong in the sky.
Well, we can get you up in the sky.

45:17.154 --> 45:19.365
Soon you can fly whenever you want.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.840
Look, weather conditions are
the same as the day we arrived.

45:22.875 --> 45:25.337
That rift will open again,
I can feel it.

45:25.372 --> 45:27.764
Diane, listen to me,
there is no way back.

45:27.799 --> 45:30.840
You cannot get home.
Then it will take me somewhere new.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.760
Merry Christmas!

45:52.000 --> 45:53.639
I'll come with you.

45:53.674 --> 45:55.244
I fly solo, Owen.

45:55.279 --> 45:57.579
I go faster and further than others.

45:57.614 --> 45:59.880
We have no idea how this rift works.

45:59.915 --> 46:02.285
You can end up anywhere.

46:02.320 --> 46:06.679
That's the beauty of it.
It's too dangerous! It's what I do.

46:06.714 --> 46:08.804
What about me?!

46:08.839 --> 46:13.760
Please, please, don't go.

46:28.600 --> 46:31.039
What memories I'm taking with me.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.400
Merry Christmas.

47:49.679 --> 47:53.239
'Because
when you take off together,

47:53.274 --> 47:56.800
'it's the next best thing
to flying. '

48:28.680 --> 48:33.400
Somebody's not only kidnapping
weevils, they're causing them pain.

48:33.435 --> 48:36.999
These guys are using weevils
to carry out the perfect murder.

48:37.034 --> 48:40.316
You want to release a weevil
in the middle of Cardiff?!

48:40.351 --> 48:43.599
I've been having sex
with someone else. His name's Owen.

48:43.634 --> 48:45.445
Who are you, Owen Harper?

48:45.480 --> 48:50.639
We're gonna hunt you down and we're gonna make
you surrender that creature that you kidnapped.

48:50.674 --> 48:55.919
Out there in the darkness,
something is coming.
