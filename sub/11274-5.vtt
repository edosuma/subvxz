WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:04.954
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.954 --> 00:06.456
Yeah, it says here

00:06.456 --> 00:08.458
there's another sighting
of the Loch Ness monster.

00:08.458 --> 00:09.959
Yeah? Do you believe that?

00:09.959 --> 00:11.461
There's even a picture of him.

00:11.461 --> 00:13.463
Whoa! Looks kind of
like President Reagan.

00:13.463 --> 00:14.414
That is Reagan.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.416
The other picture's the monster.

00:16.416 --> 00:17.417
Oh, I see.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.921
Wonder if they'll ever
catch that thing, huh?

00:21.921 --> 00:23.923
Well, I, for one, hope they never do.

00:23.923 --> 00:25.925
I mean, none of us really want to see

00:25.925 --> 00:28.428
that poor beast hauled out of the water

00:28.428 --> 00:30.430
and put on display in some sideshow.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.431
Well, I sure would.

00:31.431 --> 00:33.433
You know, we could all go together.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.434
I don't mind driving.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.436
Yeah, but, uh, you see, Woody, they...

00:36.436 --> 00:37.437
You know, it'd be kind of fun.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.438
We could pack a lunch.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.906
No, Woody, they...

00:39.906 --> 00:40.907
All right, who wants
peanut butter and jelly

00:40.907 --> 00:42.158
and who wants bologna?

00:42.158 --> 00:43.493
Woody, they...

00:43.493 --> 00:45.495
I'll have one of each, all right?

00:46.863 --> 00:51.284
(piano plays)

00:51.284 --> 00:53.703
? Making your way in the world today ?

00:53.703 --> 00:56.706
? Takes everything you've got ?

00:56.706 --> 00:59.209
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

00:59.209 --> 01:02.712
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:02.712 --> 01:08.885
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:08.885 --> 01:10.386
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:10.386 --> 01:15.892
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:16.392 --> 01:20.897
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:20.897 --> 01:23.399
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:23.399 --> 01:25.902
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:25.902 --> 01:30.907
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:31.407 --> 01:33.409
? You want to go where people know ?

01:33.910 --> 01:36.412
? People are all the same ?

01:36.412 --> 01:40.416
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

01:58.034 --> 02:02.505
Hey, Carla, how's that
house-hunting going, huh?

02:04.874 --> 02:07.844
Does that answer your question?

02:07.844 --> 02:10.597
Yes, very nicely.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.882
Boy, I'll tell you, it's hopeless.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.884
I've looked everywhere
in the Boston area,

02:14.884 --> 02:17.770
and I just cannot find a
house in my price range.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.056
After scrimping and saving for years,

02:20.056 --> 02:24.060
I think I got finally enough
set aside for a little place,

02:24.060 --> 02:26.062
and find out I ain't got squat.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.814
Well, what's the big rush?
Your apartment's fine.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.649
No, it's not.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.152
My kids get bigger, my
apartment gets smaller.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
I don't know what it's like

02:34.154 --> 02:36.039
to be alone in a bathroom anymore.

02:36.039 --> 02:37.907
What's it like, Sam?

02:39.292 --> 02:41.077
Is it everything people say it is?

02:41.077 --> 02:43.580
More. Much, much more.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.082
I knew it.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.084
Hello, everyone.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.085
Hi.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.086
DIANE: Sam, I happen

02:50.086 --> 02:51.588
to be free tonight.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.590
If a certain gentleman should

02:53.590 --> 02:55.091
come to knock on my door,

02:55.091 --> 02:57.060
say, about 7:30,

02:57.060 --> 02:59.562
I wouldn't be adverse to going out.

02:59.562 --> 03:01.064
I sure hope you get lucky.

03:02.565 --> 03:03.850
Because I did; I got myself

03:03.850 --> 03:05.735
a hot date tonight.

03:05.735 --> 03:08.605
I see what you're doing.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.524
Even though I eventually
agreed to marry you,

03:11.524 --> 03:15.028
you're still smarting from the
sting of my initial rejection

03:15.028 --> 03:17.030
and looking for ways to punish me.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.533
No, I'm not going out with
other women to punish you.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.035
That's just one of the perks.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.540
If you're trying to make
me jealous, you can stop.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.542
I want you to date these women.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.929
While they may look
better in leotards--

03:32.929 --> 03:35.431
then again,
they may not--

03:35.431 --> 03:37.934
they can't compare to the total package

03:37.934 --> 03:39.435
you've experienced with me.

03:39.936 --> 03:41.804
Oh, I see-- we're
talking brains.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.056
Listen, I'll have you know

03:43.056 --> 03:46.059
that Tiffany happens to be a
very exceptional young woman.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.446
Ah, yes, Tiffany-- the
girl with the IQ of a lamp.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.816
Let me describe her for you:

03:54.317 --> 03:55.818
spandex wardrobe.

03:55.818 --> 04:00.073
Spends all of her time in a gym.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.911
Breasts that would provide
shade for a small boy.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.333
You, you're not even close.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.085
You, you're so far from being close.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.586
She makes me crazy.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.470
Did you hear that?

04:14.470 --> 04:15.805
Yup.

04:15.805 --> 04:17.307
Hi, can I speak to Tiffany, please?

04:17.307 --> 04:19.642
I don't know; try the aerobics class.

04:19.642 --> 04:22.312
Yeah, yeah, will you just tell her

04:22.312 --> 04:24.597
that... Sam can't make it tonight.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.483
Uh, something's upset his stomach.

04:27.483 --> 04:29.986
Yeah, thank you.

04:29.986 --> 04:30.770
Whew. Boy.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.775
Got to be somebody in here with a brain.

04:35.775 --> 04:39.279
I mean, I don't even care
if she's good-looking.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.165
You got a sister, Frasier?

04:42.165 --> 04:43.866
No.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.368
You have a dress?

04:46.669 --> 04:48.171
What's the occasion?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.962
Hey, tutti-frutti and a rooti.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.464
Oh, boy, a good and gracious afternoon

04:58.464 --> 05:00.466
to every one of you wonderful people.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.968
Oh, Cliffie, cheer up, bud.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.970
Eh, Normie, I'm a happy man.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.222
I started a new route today.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.056
So, where is it?

05:07.056 --> 05:08.057
Uh, Meadowview Acres.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.059
You know, just north of the airport?

05:10.059 --> 05:11.060
It's a real plum.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.562
Yeah, best route in the city.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.563
No one else wanted it, huh?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.064
(chuckling)

05:15.064 --> 05:16.816
Are you kidding?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.651
It's a nesting ground for
stewardesses out there.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.653
Yeah, there's a house
full of them, you know,

05:20.653 --> 05:21.654
living all together.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.156
And they're nuts about me.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.657
Well, how do you know that, Mr. Clavin?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.159
Woody, they stand behind the curtain,

05:26.159 --> 05:27.660
laughing and giggling the way women do

05:28.161 --> 05:29.162
when they're taken with a man.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.665
Have a couple of drafts, Woody?

05:32.665 --> 05:33.666
Oh, hey, Carla, listen,

05:33.666 --> 05:36.169
if you're still, uh,
searching out a new house,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.171
uh, I got a doozy out there on my route.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.173
I wrote out the, uh, particulars.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.057
Give me this.

05:41.057 --> 05:43.009
"Meadowview Acres."

05:43.009 --> 05:45.511
I know where that is.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.013
I couldn't afford...

05:47.013 --> 05:50.016
Hey, this thing is in my price range...

05:50.016 --> 05:53.519
which means it is either
built on quicksand,

05:53.519 --> 05:55.405
or is currently on fire.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.690
CLIFF: Look, Carla, I looked at it

05:57.690 --> 05:59.192
and it looked all right to me.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.693
Come on, Carla, check it out.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.694
What do you got to lose?

06:01.694 --> 06:02.945
You really think I should?

06:02.945 --> 06:05.782
Yeah, remember what your
horoscope said today?

06:05.782 --> 06:08.785
"Take a chance, explore other avenues."

06:08.785 --> 06:10.670
That's right!

06:10.670 --> 06:11.504
And you know what?

06:11.504 --> 06:14.006
That jives with my other two horoscopes,

06:14.006 --> 06:17.009
my tarot cards, and Madame
Livinda's latest palm reading.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.511
SAM: Well, there you go.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.513
I think I better go give
this thing a look-see.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.014
I'll be back later. Yeah, bye-bye.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.015
CARLA: Okay.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.884
Hey, Mr. Peterson, I'm a Leo.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.135
What's my horoscope say?

06:26.135 --> 06:28.438
Young bartender should refill mug

06:28.438 --> 06:31.941
of thirsty patron at corner of bar.

06:31.941 --> 06:34.944
Those things are so vague,
they could apply to anyone.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.237
Sammy! Sammy!

06:44.237 --> 06:46.122
Listen, I went to see that house,

06:46.122 --> 06:47.039
and it was perfect.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.541
I mean, listen to this.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.544
Me and the older kids
could have rooms of our own.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.045
Oh-ho!

06:53.045 --> 06:54.547
And there's this big kitchen

06:54.547 --> 06:57.550
with Formica as far
as the eye could see.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.336
And there's grass, Sammy.

07:00.336 --> 07:04.340
I mean, can you imagine
having grass of your very own

07:04.340 --> 07:08.728
to water and mow and lie down
in naked anytime you want.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.563
That's the American dream, all right.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.482
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh--
there's a fireplace.

07:12.482 --> 07:14.484
Finally the kids are
going to have a place

07:14.484 --> 07:16.486
where they're supposed to start a fire.

07:16.486 --> 07:19.989
I'm so excited, I don't know what to do.

07:19.989 --> 07:20.990
Carla, you're talking

07:20.990 --> 07:22.492
like you've already bought the place.

07:22.492 --> 07:23.359
I did.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.744
You what? I bought it!

07:24.744 --> 07:26.162
I did!

07:26.162 --> 07:28.664
(everyone exclaiming)

07:28.664 --> 07:29.665
They took my first offer.

07:29.665 --> 07:31.167
Went through without a hitch.

07:31.167 --> 07:32.668
Your very first offer?

07:32.668 --> 07:35.171
Yeah, yeah, they could see
I'd be a tough negotiator

07:35.171 --> 07:36.172
and buckled under.

07:36.172 --> 07:37.423
Well, when do you move in?

07:37.423 --> 07:38.257
In a few weeks.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.259
I got to wait for the loan to clear,

07:40.259 --> 07:42.678
but the guy at the
bank said not to worry,

07:42.678 --> 07:43.679
so I'm not going to.

07:44.180 --> 07:45.681
Life is too wonderful to worry.

07:45.681 --> 07:47.183
Thank you.

07:47.183 --> 07:48.184
SAM: Carla, Carla,

07:48.184 --> 07:49.635
don't you think there's somebody else

07:49.635 --> 07:51.554
you ought to say something to?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.556
Oh.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.313
Cliff.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.114
Stop. Don't move.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.616
Don't turn around.

08:03.616 --> 08:04.617
Don't say anything.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.118
Just look at the floor.

08:06.118 --> 08:07.119
Huh?

08:07.119 --> 08:09.121
Just do as I said.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.077
Cliff, I want to thank you
for telling me about the house.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.579
You're welcome.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.081
Oh, puke. I knew you'd get mushy.

08:25.972 --> 08:31.477
I see the search for intelligent
forms of life continues.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.477
Do you mind?

08:32.477 --> 08:33.980
You're in my light.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.982
I am your light.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.485
Happy hunting.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.486
Uh-huh.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.488
Evening, everybody.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.990
EVERYONE: Norm!

08:43.990 --> 08:45.441
What's shakin', Mr. Peterson?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.443
What isn't?

08:51.447 --> 08:52.448
Hey, there, Norm.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.451
Carla bought that
house I told her about.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.703
And she knew its history?

08:57.703 --> 08:59.038
What, what do you mean?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.039
Well, the asking price

09:00.039 --> 09:01.541
just seemed a little low for that area,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.543
so I did a little checking on my own.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.044
Oh, no. I don't think
I want to hear this.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.429
Yeah, apparently,

09:06.429 --> 09:07.797
the house is built

09:07.797 --> 09:10.683
directly over the graveyard
of a 17th-century prison.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.936
Oh, my God!

09:13.936 --> 09:16.439
It wasn't exactly a
white-collar prison, either.

09:16.439 --> 09:18.941
The worst murderers and
cutthroats of their time.

09:19.442 --> 09:20.810
They executed hundreds of them.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.194
(groans)

09:22.194 --> 09:25.114
Local legend has it that they're
going to rise from the grave

09:25.114 --> 09:27.617
and seek revenge on
whoever dares to live there.

09:27.617 --> 09:29.368
(groaning)

09:29.368 --> 09:31.537
NORM: Well, we all know

09:31.537 --> 09:34.373
how superstitious Carla is.

09:34.373 --> 09:37.376
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God,

09:37.376 --> 09:40.379
oh, God! What's with him?

09:40.379 --> 09:43.249
He, uh, forgot his dry cleaning.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.587
Let me have a scotch
and an Irish coffee.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.058
I guess she doesn't know about it, huh?

09:52.058 --> 09:53.559
Of course she doesn't know.

09:53.559 --> 09:56.562
Would you buy a house that
had that kind of history?

09:56.562 --> 09:58.431
Houses have karmas.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.683
SAM: Look at her; she's so happy.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.352
But she has a right to know.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.654
Well, I don't know.

10:04.654 --> 10:07.156
It's always dangerous
to mess with Carla,

10:07.156 --> 10:09.158
but especially when she's happy.

10:09.158 --> 10:10.660
It's like when, uh, Frankenstein

10:10.660 --> 10:12.662
was playing with the
little girl, you know?

10:12.662 --> 10:14.664
It was a bad time to go
up to him with a torch.

10:15.164 --> 10:16.415
CLIFF: Yes, it's

10:16.415 --> 10:18.584
a terrible time; a
terrible, terrible time.

10:18.584 --> 10:19.869
I don't know; I think Diane's right.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.870
I think we should tell her.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.121
Maybe it's not too late

10:22.121 --> 10:24.340
to do something about it.

10:24.340 --> 10:25.791
Hey, Carla?

10:25.791 --> 10:26.792
Yeah, Sam?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.795
I got something to tell
you about the house.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.798
Something not great.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.468
I knew it.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.304
Carla Tortelli, when
will you ever learn?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.806
After all these years of heartbreak,

10:40.806 --> 10:42.558
you still get your hopes up.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.360
Okay, get it over with.

10:44.860 --> 10:46.612
What's wrong with it?

10:46.612 --> 10:48.447
Diane?

10:51.951 --> 10:57.323
Carla, your house is built over
a 17th-century prison graveyard.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.627
That's it?

11:01.627 --> 11:04.046
Mm-hmm.

11:04.046 --> 11:05.498
Thank God!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.383
I thought you were
gonna say it had dry rot.

11:07.383 --> 11:08.217
Dry...?

11:08.217 --> 11:10.586
Oh, no problem.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.423
So, how's the new homeowner, huh?

11:30.423 --> 11:32.808
Fine. Just great.

11:32.808 --> 11:33.809
Well, are you still living

11:33.809 --> 11:35.811
out of those cardboard boxes?

11:35.811 --> 11:37.813
Yeah, you know how it is.

11:38.814 --> 11:39.815
DIANE: You know, Carla,

11:39.815 --> 11:42.318
I really admire you.

11:42.318 --> 11:45.321
It took such courage to overlook

11:45.321 --> 11:47.823
the unhallowed ground on
which your house is built.

11:47.823 --> 11:51.243
I know I would've had my
last earthly moment of rest

11:51.243 --> 11:53.746
in that house the moment I moved in.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.499
Why, I could no more close my eyes

11:56.499 --> 12:00.503
in that cauldron of blood
than sever my own arm.

12:00.503 --> 12:02.004
SAM: Hey, Diane...

12:03.255 --> 12:05.591
Oh, yes, well...

12:05.591 --> 12:07.593
Angels on your pillow.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.214
You know, I get this feeling in my gut

12:12.214 --> 12:14.216
that something's bothering Carla.

12:14.216 --> 12:16.102
I'm going to find out what it is.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.888
Hey, uh, so, Carla, how's the house?

12:18.888 --> 12:21.640
It's a great house!
It's a wonderful house!

12:21.640 --> 12:23.442
It's the best house in the world!

12:23.442 --> 12:24.443
(angrily): Ooh!

12:27.730 --> 12:29.231
What's the matter?

12:29.231 --> 12:31.734
Nothing.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.736
Did you find a problem
after you moved in?

12:33.736 --> 12:39.992
No... 'cause I haven't
actually moved in yet.

12:39.992 --> 12:43.796
So... you are bothered
by the house's history?

12:43.796 --> 12:45.798
Of course I'm bothered by it.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.800
I saw Poltergeist.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.802
Do you think I want to end up in the TV?

12:53.305 --> 12:55.307
I just didn't say anything before

12:55.307 --> 12:58.177
'cause I didn't want
anyone to know I was scared.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.147
Sammy, there's something
evil in that house,

13:01.147 --> 13:05.151
something cold and clammy and horrible.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.652
It doesn't want me there.

13:06.652 --> 13:10.072
Carla, I've had phobias before,

13:10.072 --> 13:12.575
and I've found that
the first essential step

13:12.575 --> 13:15.077
in overcoming one is to confront it.

13:15.077 --> 13:17.580
I'll bet if you spent one night,

13:17.580 --> 13:19.582
God help you, in that house...

13:21.083 --> 13:23.085
...your fears would be licked.

13:23.085 --> 13:24.086
Hey.

13:24.086 --> 13:25.087
You're not going to let anything

13:25.087 --> 13:27.089
stand in the way of
your dreams, are you?

13:30.009 --> 13:31.510
No, I'm not.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.512
I've never been a quitter.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.881
I'm going to spend
tonight in that house.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.299
Good for you, Carla.

13:37.299 --> 13:38.300
Damn right!

13:38.300 --> 13:40.302
I'm going to conquer this thing.

13:40.302 --> 13:42.304
I'm not going to let any demons

13:42.304 --> 13:45.691
from the other world deny me my house.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.028
Last chance to stop me.

13:59.121 --> 14:01.240
(dog growling faintly)

14:04.960 --> 14:07.796
(keys rattling)

14:10.216 --> 14:12.134
(lock clicks)

14:27.149 --> 14:29.602
(door creaking)

14:38.861 --> 14:40.663
(switch clicks twice)

14:42.615 --> 14:45.501
(clicking repeatedly)

15:02.184 --> 15:03.185
(sighs)

15:03.185 --> 15:06.105
Only ten more hours to go.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.107
(doorbell rings)

15:08.107 --> 15:10.609
(gasps, shrieks)

15:28.043 --> 15:31.246
What are you two
ding-a-lings doing here?

15:31.246 --> 15:34.300
Well, uh, we, uh, come
to spend the night.

15:35.801 --> 15:38.804
And, uh...

15:39.805 --> 15:41.807
I brought you a little
pizza with anchovies.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.309
I hate anchovies.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.810
Yeah, me, too.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.812
Then let's eat, huh?

15:48.314 --> 15:50.316
Hey, you know, this is a, uh,

15:50.316 --> 15:51.817
nice place, Carla.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.686
NORM: Yeah. Oh, yeah, hey, look.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.521
Great fireplace here, Normie. Yeah.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.022
Super living room.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.423
Hey, you know, with a, uh,

15:58.524 --> 16:00.526
little fresh paint and
some new wallpaper...

16:00.526 --> 16:02.528
you'll have some, uh...

16:02.528 --> 16:05.030
fresh paint and new wallpaper.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.034
Look, I appreciate what
you guys are trying to do,

16:09.034 --> 16:10.035
but it's not necessary.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.420
I'm fine.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.672
Oh, sure, you're fine. It's
a terrific place, Carla.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.174
It's got a really nice feeling in here.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.176
It's, uh, warm and cozy.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.678
Have you checked out the
rest of the place yet?

16:19.678 --> 16:21.180
No, I thought it might be

16:21.180 --> 16:23.182
a good idea to have a beer first.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.184
Yeah, I find that pretty much applies

16:25.184 --> 16:27.686
to just about everything.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.189
(dogs howling outside)

16:30.189 --> 16:31.607
What was that?

16:31.607 --> 16:32.558
Hound from hell.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.860
No, no, no, no.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.862
That's, a... that was a Dalmatian.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.865
I'd say probably six, seven years old.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.734
Definitely neutered.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.153
Yep... I've, uh, never been bitten

16:44.153 --> 16:46.155
by that breed, but, uh...

16:46.155 --> 16:47.156
(phone rings)

16:47.156 --> 16:48.657
What was that?

16:48.657 --> 16:51.076
It was the telephone.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.080
Keep an eye on Indiana Jones here, huh?

16:56.582 --> 16:59.585
I do not have a good feeling
about this place, Cliff.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.086
All right, Normie, look,

17:01.086 --> 17:02.588
I said we're going to stick it out,

17:02.588 --> 17:04.589
and that's exactly what
we're going to do, eh?

17:05.590 --> 17:06.592
All right, if the going gets tough,

17:06.592 --> 17:08.093
you can count on Norm Peterson.

17:09.595 --> 17:10.596
Well, that was Sam.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.098
Vera called. She wants you to come home.

17:13.098 --> 17:13.982
Yep. I'm out of here.

17:15.851 --> 17:18.353
Norm, Norm, come on!

17:18.353 --> 17:19.354
I mean, since when are you

17:19.354 --> 17:21.857
in such a rush to get home to Vera?

17:21.857 --> 17:24.358
Since you moved in
over a graveyard, Carla.

17:24.358 --> 17:25.359
Guys, look, I-I'm sorry.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.362
I just... I don't know.

17:27.362 --> 17:31.867
Scary stuff... just scares me.

17:36.672 --> 17:39.091
Hey, hey, Normie, you're driving!

17:55.190 --> 17:56.975
(sighs)

17:56.975 --> 18:01.029
Well, guess it's, uh...
just the two of us, huh?

18:01.029 --> 18:02.531
Yep.

18:02.531 --> 18:04.983
("A Summer Place" playing) You
can take off, too, you know.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.368
There's nothing keeping you here.

18:06.368 --> 18:08.153
Yeah, no, I know.

18:10.572 --> 18:15.077
Oh... I love that song.

18:18.580 --> 18:22.084
Gee, I went to a lot of
dances in high school.

18:22.084 --> 18:23.919
You were a dancer?

18:23.919 --> 18:26.338
No, no, I was on the,
uh, decorating committee.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.725
I still have crepe paper
stains on my fingers.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.762
Yeah, I remember, you know,
watching all those kids

18:33.762 --> 18:35.264
out there having one hell of a time,

18:35.264 --> 18:38.267
and I thought, "Boy, I'd love
to be out there with them,"

18:38.267 --> 18:40.769
but I could never find a
partner to practice with.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.521
Fascinating.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.028
Hey, hey, hey, keep your grubby fingers

18:50.028 --> 18:53.532
off my piece there.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.535
Hey, Carla, you know something?

18:56.535 --> 19:00.455
This is the, uh, first time
we've ever been alone together.

19:00.455 --> 19:01.957
Please, I'm eating.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.346
Can I ask you a question?

19:07.346 --> 19:08.847
Who's stopping you?

19:09.848 --> 19:11.350
How come you're always getting on me?

19:11.800 --> 19:14.770
Is it my fault you're such a yutz?

19:15.687 --> 19:17.689
And as long as we're asking questions,

19:17.689 --> 19:19.191
what are you doing here tonight?

19:19.191 --> 19:22.644
Well, having a little
beer and a little pizza,

19:22.644 --> 19:26.148
and, uh... helping a friend
through a scary night.

19:27.149 --> 19:28.984
You think I'm scared?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.320
I'm not scared.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.822
No, Carla... it's
nothing to be ashamed of.

19:33.822 --> 19:35.824
Remember what, uh,
Ernest Hemingway said...

19:35.824 --> 19:37.209
Would you shut up?

19:37.209 --> 19:39.628
No, I think that was Jack London.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.051
Look, Carla,

19:46.051 --> 19:48.554
I feel a little responsible
for getting you into this,

19:48.554 --> 19:49.838
and I just thought you needed,

19:49.838 --> 19:51.840
uh, somebody to be here with you.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.843
I don't need anybody, least of all you.

19:55.844 --> 19:56.728
All right.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.097
Fine.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.601
(door creaks open)

20:02.601 --> 20:04.102
Cliff?

20:08.574 --> 20:10.525
("Blue on Blue" playing)

20:10.525 --> 20:13.829
You know, uh...

20:14.329 --> 20:17.783
I taught a couple of
guys to dance in my day.

20:19.701 --> 20:21.703
So?

20:23.121 --> 20:25.123
So nothing.

20:30.045 --> 20:32.547
First rule:

20:32.547 --> 20:35.550
no stepping on the teacher's feet.

20:35.550 --> 20:37.552
(chuckles)

20:37.552 --> 20:38.553
Well,

20:38.553 --> 20:40.055
yes, ma'am.

20:40.055 --> 20:42.557
Give me your hands.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.981
Loosen up, would ya?

20:48.981 --> 20:50.232
I don't bite.

20:51.533 --> 20:53.035
Well, not you.

20:54.036 --> 20:55.037
All right,

20:55.037 --> 20:57.956
rock, walk.

20:57.956 --> 21:01.460
Rock... don't bounce.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.963
BOTH: Rock, walk, rock, walk...

21:04.963 --> 21:07.332
CARLA: There you go.

21:22.731 --> 21:25.233
Hey! Hey!

21:25.233 --> 21:27.352
What was your leg doing
underneath my head?

21:27.352 --> 21:29.771
I don't know.

21:29.771 --> 21:31.023
Hey, I was asleep.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.576
I, I, I didn't even enjoy it.

21:34.576 --> 21:37.779
You better not have.

21:40.615 --> 21:44.119
What, uh, what time is it?

21:44.119 --> 21:45.620
It's 4:30 in the morning.

21:45.620 --> 21:46.621
Whoo...

21:48.623 --> 21:50.625
It's gonna be dawn soon.

21:52.627 --> 21:53.628
Hey!

21:53.628 --> 21:55.013
I did it!

21:55.013 --> 21:56.882
I stayed here all night!

21:56.882 --> 21:58.383
The spell is broken.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.385
Thank you, Cliff. Thank you. Thank you.

22:03.105 --> 22:07.109
Oh, I wonder how long she's
been wanting to do that.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.533
It's gonna be okay.

22:14.533 --> 22:18.737
My luck is finally changing.

22:18.737 --> 22:19.821
Hey, can you feel it?

22:19.821 --> 22:21.740
Uh, feel what?

22:21.740 --> 22:24.493
The house, it's different now.

22:24.493 --> 22:27.746
It likes me. It wants me.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.131
You know what?

22:29.131 --> 22:31.633
I think I'm gonna put
the couch right over here.

22:31.633 --> 22:33.635
And the oil painting of me and Elvis

22:33.635 --> 22:35.637
on that wall.

22:35.637 --> 22:36.638
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.

22:36.638 --> 22:37.639
And the easy chair...

22:37.639 --> 22:39.641
(rumbling)

22:39.641 --> 22:42.644
What's that?

22:42.644 --> 22:43.645
I don't know.

22:43.645 --> 22:46.648
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

22:46.648 --> 22:48.150
They're coming to get us.

22:48.150 --> 22:51.019
They're gonna drag us back
down to the grave with them!

22:56.358 --> 22:57.492
(gasps)

22:57.492 --> 23:00.779
(screaming)

23:00.779 --> 23:02.114
(jet engines roaring)

23:02.114 --> 23:02.998
(screaming)

23:04.499 --> 23:07.502
No, wait, no, Carla,

23:07.502 --> 23:08.503
know what that is?

23:08.503 --> 23:13.008
It... it's-it's not the
dead coming out of the grave

23:13.008 --> 23:15.010
to feast on human flesh.

23:15.010 --> 23:18.013
It's an L-1011
wide-body.

23:20.015 --> 23:23.518
You know, the sounds are very similar.

23:23.518 --> 23:25.520
Yeah.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.522
And I understand that
during foggy weather,

23:27.522 --> 23:29.474
they have to reroute those babies

23:29.474 --> 23:30.475
to runway two-niner.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.477
It must be near here.

23:36.565 --> 23:38.450
Do you mean

23:38.450 --> 23:42.704
that this house, my house,

23:42.704 --> 23:44.706
is at the end of a runway?

23:44.706 --> 23:48.076
(whimpering): Uh-huh.

23:48.076 --> 23:50.962
And that was a wide-body jet

23:50.962 --> 23:53.465
landing ten feet from my backyard?

23:53.465 --> 23:54.966
(whimpers): Yeah.

23:54.966 --> 23:58.887
And this house is not
cheap because it's haunted,

23:58.887 --> 24:02.307
but because it is right
next to the airport?

24:02.307 --> 24:03.308
Yeah.

24:03.308 --> 24:07.179
I'm home! Yay!

24:08.305 --> 24:14.474
