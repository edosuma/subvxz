14:50.557 --> 14:51.975
Okay. Mr. Nuts.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.981
I woke up with a headache.
I felt a little dizzy.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.107
I thought it might be the Rona,

14:59.190 --> 15:01.192
so I want to make sure
I didn't give it to my pet worm.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.745
Don't be afraid to go deep either.
I dig it. Mmm, tickly.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.039
But in a good way.
Like a little nostril orgasm.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.000
Is it my turn?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.335
She has to go on the left hole

15:18.418 --> 15:20.462
because the right one has
a tiddlywink stuck in it.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.088
No need. Come here.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.308
There. Now if I have it, you have it.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.727
We just killed two birds with one Q tip.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.817
-What's the plan?
-I thought you were coming up with a plan.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.236
I was giving the forms to Gloria.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.113
You can't walk and think
at the same time?

15:47.197 --> 15:48.281
I don't know. I never tried.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.991
I usually sit down when I have to think.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.370
Aw. You get that from me.

15:56.456 --> 16:00.335
Oh. Here she is. Let's see
where they hide the Q tips.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.296
Sketchy looking guy with a pet worm.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.298
What do you think?
Does he have it?

16:07.384 --> 16:09.010
It is decidedly so.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.476
Holy shit.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.772
They're not really testing people.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.274
They're taking the cash
and making up the results.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.776
Oh, man. That sucks.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.820
Does it? Did you see in there?

16:26.903 --> 16:29.948
They've got cash,
a laptop, and I bet there's enough

16:30.031 --> 16:32.742
Q tips to clean my ears till Christmas.
And the best part?

16:32.826 --> 16:35.578
They're douchebags,
so your goody-two-shoes cell mate

16:35.662 --> 16:37.122
will help us steal all of it.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.417
We just found our next job.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.172
[camera shutter snapping]

16:53.430 --> 16:56.141
You thought this was a wise
wardrobe choice for your sentencing?

16:56.224 --> 16:58.893
He didn't have a suit
and wanted to avoid telling his parents

16:58.977 --> 17:02.063
where he was going today
and found this in their attic.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.401
In their garage.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.738
Son, have you ever heard
that marijuana is a gateway drug?

17:09.821 --> 17:11.448
Yes, sir, but I've
never tried any other drugs.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.993
Arlene, tell him what
marijuana is a gateway to in my court.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.871
-Prison.
-Prison. It's a gateway to prison.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.330
Arlene nailed it.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.542
And the government has
made my job very easy by instituting

17:22.625 --> 17:25.795
mandatory minimum
sentences for all drug-related crimes.

17:25.879 --> 17:29.424
This is your second offense.
The mandatory minimum is 15 years.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.886
And since the drugs were
confiscated within 1000 feet of a school,

17:32.969 --> 17:35.138
that doubles it to 30 years.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.392
Congratulations, son.
You hit the-- Arlene?

17:39.476 --> 17:42.979
-Jackpot.
-She's on fire today.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.322
[Gloria] Shouldn't we tape down
the sides of the shower curtain?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.948
I'm not made of tape.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.577
Just make sure you cough,
talk, and breathe up through the flue.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.580
Got it. Sorry. Got it.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.750
Show him the pictures we took at the vet's
office, so he can come up with a plan.

18:06.544 --> 18:11.257
[chuckles] That's funny. He's sending
the bat flu up the chimney flue.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.804
Probably how it got its name.
In the Spanish flu,

18:16.179 --> 18:20.809
I bet they put sick people in fireplaces
and made them cough up the hole.

18:20.892 --> 18:24.312
-And so they called the hole the flue.
-That's not how...

18:25.230 --> 18:28.900
-No.
-Really? What makes you so smart?

18:28.983 --> 18:29.901
Well, I don't know.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.486
I went to college,
if that's what you mean.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.072
Oh, aren't you fancy or full of shit?

18:34.155 --> 18:37.033
Don't meet a lot
of ex-cons with college degrees.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.451
Well, what can I say?

18:38.535 --> 18:41.955
Some of us use our psychology degrees
to make real money instead of

18:42.038 --> 18:44.874
helping grown men
overcome their mommy issues.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.419
Why are you looking at me?
Mommy, why is she looking at me?

18:48.503 --> 18:49.838
Because she thinks she's smart.

18:49.921 --> 18:52.006
But let me ask you something,
college girl.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.926
Did you ever take
any classes on the history of fireplaces?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.928
-No.
-I rest my case.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.101
So, what do you think? You got a plan yet?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.854
I think so.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.699
I'll never rob places at 3:00 a.m. again.
Streets are empty.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.077
If someone sees you lurking that time
of night, they know something's fishy.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.789
The best time to rob a business
is right after they close.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.457
That way,
if someone sees you trying to get in,

19:26.541 --> 19:29.294
they assume you work there
and don't call the cops.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.338
Plus, I'm getting old
and I'm sleepy by nine.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.506
Hmm.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.426
-Oh!
-Mm-hmm.

19:38.219 --> 19:41.306
I'm telling you, there's no need
to break a window or use a crowbar.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.475
Most of your standard locks can be
picked with a couple of paper clips

19:44.559 --> 19:47.145
or even a bobby pin,
if you know what you're doing.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.524
See that door over there?
Bet I can pick it in less than a minute.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.705
[funky music playing]

20:24.182 --> 20:26.517
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Getting the good stuff.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.069
Cracking a safe
is just listening for clicks...

20:37.904 --> 20:39.238
doing the math...

20:40.698 --> 20:43.534
and having a little patience.

20:55.421 --> 20:59.133
It's been too long. I'm worried
he might have passed out or something.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.928
-I'm going in.
-Make sure you get the Q tips.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.484
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

21:17.694 --> 21:20.905
Is that furry nut muncher
still in my glove box?

21:20.989 --> 21:22.115
No.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.241
-Open it.
-Why?

21:23.324 --> 21:26.786
Because I want to know
if there's a squirrel in my glove box.

21:26.869 --> 21:27.996
There isn't.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.666
Okay. Okay.
There's a squirrel in your glove box.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.085
Damn it, Rooster.
How many times do I have to

21:34.168 --> 21:37.588
tell you that you cannot keep
wild animals as pets?

21:37.672 --> 21:39.507
But he wants to stay with me.

21:40.258 --> 21:44.595
-I can see it in his eyes.
-Fine. Open the glove box.

21:45.054 --> 21:48.349
If he wants to be your pet,
there's no point in keeping him locked up.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.185
Okay.

22:01.279 --> 22:04.615
See? He loves me.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.618
-[squirrel chittering]
-[Rooster grunting, yelping]

22:27.638 --> 22:28.973
What's taking so long?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.518
My ears are plugged. I'm gonna
need you to listen while I spin the dial.

22:32.602 --> 22:35.354
I'm gonna find something
to protect me from your germs.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.149
This should work.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.151
That was super uncool, Mommy.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.495
[Dad] It's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be okay.

22:50.578 --> 22:54.165
Well, that's a fly in the ointment
we're going to have to swat.

22:54.957 --> 22:55.792
Hello?

22:56.834 --> 22:59.504
Is anyone here? Hello?

23:00.463 --> 23:01.881
-Hide!
-Oh, shit!

23:03.966 --> 23:06.010
-Can we help you?
-Are you the doctors?

23:06.719 --> 23:09.347
I'm a doctor. He's my son.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.723
-How come you get to be...?
-Shh.

23:11.682 --> 23:12.767
-I hit a squirrel.
-What kind of squirrel? Grey?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.560
-Please tell me it's not grey.
-It's grey.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.563
We'll do our best.

23:24.028 --> 23:24.904
You guys still here?

23:25.655 --> 23:27.240
-What's going on?
-What was that?

23:27.323 --> 23:29.450
-Who's out there?
-Fine. Don't panic.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.410
Just a couple of civilians.
I got it covered.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.706
Get the hell away from us, sickie.
Quarantine. Quarantine.

23:35.790 --> 23:36.958
What the hell is taking so long?

23:37.041 --> 23:38.876
Cash is in the safe,
and he's having trouble opening it.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.879
Forget the cash.
All we need is this laptop, right?

23:41.963 --> 23:43.923
I can't tell if this is Mr. Nuts or not.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.425
I'm trying to smell his breath

23:46.509 --> 23:48.177
for the Reese's Pieces,
but he's barely breathing.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.471
I think we gotta give him
mouth to mouth or something.

23:50.555 --> 23:53.975
No one is putting their lips
on that dirty-ass tree rat.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.685
That's how this
whole Corona thing started.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.272
-People sucking on wild creatures.
-[knocking] Barb.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.440
Those people out there
saw both your faces.

24:01.524 --> 24:02.942
-This is bad.
-Relax.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.694
We'll just wait here a couple of minutes,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.696
then we'll tell them
we did everything we could

24:06.779 --> 24:10.366
-but the squirrel is in a better place.
-We can't just let him die.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.578
You know, this is all your fault.
Why couldn't you just let me keep him?

24:13.661 --> 24:18.249
Because every time you've kept a wild
animal as a pet, you've gotten hurt.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.209
The raccoon gave you tetanus.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.712
The baby deer gave you
foot and mouth disease.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.673
That damned chicken nearly
poked your eye out when you fell asleep

24:25.756 --> 24:27.592
and rolled over during a back scratch.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.637
I'm your mom, and I need to protect you.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.848
Hey, what was that thing
you said before about mommy issues?

24:33.931 --> 24:36.642
-She has them, doesn't she?
-Um, actually, that would be you.

24:36.726 --> 24:40.855
I'd say she has more of a codependent
personality with a tendency towards

24:40.938 --> 24:44.859
control and overprotectiveness that
has resulted in your arrested development.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.028
Oh, now you're blaming me
for him getting arrested?

24:47.111 --> 24:48.237
No, I'm not.

24:48.321 --> 24:51.157
You don't have to protect me anymore, mom,
and I can protect myself.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.037
Not gonna let this little guy die.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.497
Oh. Good.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.167
I could've lived without seeing this.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.255
Oh, shit. It's working.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.091
[screaming]

25:23.814 --> 25:26.567
-This thing's already coming in handy.
-Is he gone?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.921
He's gone.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.339
I'll notify the family.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.932
Hey, Ma, come listen to this.
My lip has a heartbeat.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.517
I'll take your word for it.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.270
Gloria, you find any info
on the congresswoman yet?

26:02.353 --> 26:04.272
I haven't tried.
I'll do it in the morning.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.941
Haven't tried? What the hell have you
been doing on that thing?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.443
Whoa. What's this?

26:10.319 --> 26:14.240
I remember Trump on TV
talking about a way to fight this virus.

26:14.949 --> 26:19.704
Keep it to yourself, though. I think
I only have enough of the two of us.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.093
You're welcome.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.554
-For what?
-I found your parents.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.764
Seriously? They're alive?

26:38.848 --> 26:40.808
They live in a retirement home
in San Diego.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.768
You're not allowed
to visit because of COVID.

26:42.852 --> 26:45.396
But I did some digging,
and your mom registered a tablet

26:45.479 --> 26:47.648
two years ago,
which means you can video chat with them.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.943
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Hold on. No.

26:51.027 --> 26:54.989
I just want you to tell them if I die.
I'm not ready...

26:55.614 --> 26:58.326
I haven't talked to them
in a really long time.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.329
-How long?
-Long.

27:02.455 --> 27:07.126
After I went to prison, I refused
to see them. I was too ashamed.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.545
They wrote me letters
for a while, but, uh...

27:09.795 --> 27:13.549
after a few years of me not writing back,
the letters stopped coming.

27:14.842 --> 27:18.346
I can't. I don't even know
what I'd say to them.

27:19.513 --> 27:24.226
Say you've missed them. If my parents
were still here, that's what I'd say.

27:26.354 --> 27:29.065
No, don't. Hey!
How do I stop it?

27:29.398 --> 27:30.900
[ringing]

27:35.654 --> 27:37.782
-Where's the mouse?
-Hello?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.033
Hello?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.077
Who is that?

27:42.828 --> 27:46.290
-What's going on?
-My iTablet made a sound,

27:46.374 --> 27:52.088
and now there's a man sitting in
a little brick house staring back at me.

27:53.756 --> 27:54.590
Mom?

27:55.883 --> 27:56.717
Dad?

27:59.470 --> 28:02.598
-Jack?
-No, that's too old to be Jack.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.476
Yeah. It's me.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.235
It's so good to see you.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.949
-Look at you, all grown.
-Is that your cell?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.535
Why is it so small?
Did you misbehave?

28:22.618 --> 28:27.581
No, I'm not in prison anymore.
I'm in a fireplace. It's a long stor...

28:30.835 --> 28:33.462
Jack, is that a wool sweater
you're wearing?

28:34.422 --> 28:35.631
I think so.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.468
You know, when you were born,
my mother gave you a wool blanket.

28:39.552 --> 28:44.473
And you had such an allergic reaction,
you ended up in the hospital.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.184
We had to get all the wool
out of the house.

28:47.268 --> 28:51.522
-Really cold ankles that winter.
-Allergic to wool.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.149
Thank God.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.318
To our health.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.948
Hey, I'm not sick.
I'm just allergic to wool.

29:01.866 --> 29:04.326
So tell me everything.
When did you move?

29:04.410 --> 29:07.371
[Mom] Six months ago.
I'm already sick of the food.

"What's pickleball?
Sounds like a venereal disease."

29:15.212 --> 29:16.964
I did. I did say that.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.050
Okay.
I've probably kept you up long enough.

29:20.134 --> 29:22.928
I'll call you back tomorrow
and we'll pick up where we left off, okay?

29:23.012 --> 29:26.056
-You promise you're going to call?
-Yeah, I promise.

29:28.726 --> 29:32.521
-I love you.
-We love you, too, Jackie boy.

29:38.861 --> 29:42.072
Can you hang up? I'm still
trying to figure out these buttons.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.701
-Trying.
-No. No, stop.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.952
It's not. It's on the left.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.162
Stop.

A local veterinary clinic
has found itself

30:47.471 --> 30:49.932
in a dog bowl
full of hot water this morning

30:50.015 --> 30:52.768
after administering fake COVID tests

30:52.851 --> 30:55.688
and determining results
via magic eight ball.

30:55.771 --> 31:00.109
Baby, come look at this.
This news lady has the earrings I want.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.736
I was a little suspicious
when my first test came back

31:02.820 --> 31:04.488
"Reply hazy. Try again."

31:04.572 --> 31:08.450
But when the second test came back
"Outlook good," I didn't question it.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.370
Then I woke up this morning
to an envelope taped to my mailbox.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.205
Had the cash in it
that I paid for the test

31:13.289 --> 31:14.707
and a note saying it was all fake.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.042
So I called the police. The worst part is

31:17.126 --> 31:19.670
I sent a lot of my friends there
to get tested, and...

31:19.753 --> 31:22.923
Well, I guess it wasn't decidedly so
after all.

I'm sorry.
Who's pecker is that?
