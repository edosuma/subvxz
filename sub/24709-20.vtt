WEBVTT

00:34.367 --> 00:35.160
HEY, ANDY.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.536
HEY.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.833
WHAT DO WE GOT,
SHANNON?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.793
THIS ONE'S EX-HUSBAND
SHOT HER BOYFRIEND.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.253
DID SHE SEE IT?

00:45.336 --> 00:47.130
SHE WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
HER NAME'S ROSE CARLTON.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.423
HOW BAD'S HER BOYFRIEND?

00:48.506 --> 00:50.633
ONE IN THE SHOULDER.
HE DIDN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.093
HE'S GETTING PATCHED UP
AT BELLEVUE.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.679
EX-HUSBAND'S ALREADY
ON HIS WAY IN
TO THE HOUSE.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.056
WHERE'D THEY
PICK HIM UP?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.599
WALKING AROUND
THE STREET HERE.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.184
WASN'T LOOKING TO RUN
OR NOTHING.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.854
HE DIDN'T MAKE NO TROUBLE
WHEN THE SECTOR CAR
PULLED UP.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.023
HI.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.483
ROSE CARLTON?

01:06.566 --> 01:07.942
DETECTIVES.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.570
MY ASSHOLE EX-HUSBAND EVERETT
SHOT MY BOYFRIEND LONNIE,

01:10.653 --> 01:12.113
FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.407
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.034
COULD YOU SHOW US
WHERE HE SHOT HIM?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.169
HOW YOU FEELING, ANDY?

01:27.170 --> 01:28.129
GOOD.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.724
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
YOU DIRTY SEX FIEND.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.564
THIS WAS ON THE FLOOR.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.649
WE WERE WATCHING TV,

01:47.690 --> 01:50.693
AND BOOM, EVERETT BUSTS IN.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.612
HE'S SCREAMING LIKE A MADMAN.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.280
SO LONNIE
TOOK OUT HIS GUN,

01:54.364 --> 01:56.199
BUT EVERETT TOOK IT AWAY
AND SHOT HIM,

01:56.241 --> 01:58.076
'CAUSE HE COULDN'T
STAND THE THOUGHT

01:58.159 --> 02:00.078
OF ANOTHER BLACK MAN
HAVING ME.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.872
Russell: TOOK LONNIE'S GUN.
SO YOUR EX-HUSBAND CAME IN
UNARMED.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.624
EVERETT COULD'VE HAD
SOMETHING CONCEALED
ON HIS BODY.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.334
Russell:
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.211
NO. THINGS WERE
PRETTY CRAZY.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.631
YOU SAY HE BUSTED IN?
THIS DOOR
DON'T LOOK DAMAGED.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.175
YEAH? SO?
I SAID WHAT HE DID.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.718
Sipowicz:
YOU LET HIM IN?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.220
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.514
HEARD A KNOCK,
OPENED THE DOOR,
AND HE BUSTS IN.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.515
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.516
YOU SMOKE CRACK?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.184
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

02:23.226 --> 02:25.145
CRACK. THIS YOURS?

02:28.565 --> 02:31.401
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME,

02:31.484 --> 02:34.279
BUT I AM NOT TAKING
A COLLAR FOR THAT.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.281
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT

02:36.364 --> 02:38.783
TO BE NOSIN' AROUND
IN THERE LIKE THAT!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.118
HEY, HEY.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.536
TAKE IT EASY.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.121
I TOLD YOU
THE SITUATION.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.539
I GIVE YOU
ENOUGH DETAILS

02:44.581 --> 02:46.541
TO HANG THAT SUCKER
BY THE BALLS.
NOW, ARE WE DONE?

02:46.583 --> 02:49.419
NO, WE'RE NOT DONE.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME
TO THE STATION HOUSE WITH US.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.713
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE US
A FORMAL STATEMENT.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.798
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FORMAL?
I JUST--I JUST GAVE
A STATEMENT.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.675
ALL RIGHT, CUT THE GUFF.
YOU'RE COMIN' IN.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.845
Rose: I WANT A GUARANTEE
THAT I AM NOT A COLLAR
FOR THAT PIPE,

02:58.928 --> 03:00.096
WHICH AIN'T MINE!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.347
YOU GOT IT.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.227
Simone: HEY.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.520
WHO'S THIS?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.063
IT'S MY DAUGHTER.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.940
SHE'S WITH
HER GRANDMOTHER
IN CLEVELAND NOW

03:11.024 --> 03:13.026
OFF OF MY FEAR OF
EVERETT'S HARASSING ME.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.361
AND SHE'S NOT INVOLVED
IN THIS.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.860
Fancy: SO, THE CRACKHEAD
WOMAN THAT'S IN
THE COFFEE ROOM?

04:37.944 --> 04:40.280
THE CRACKHEAD WOMAN'S
MINDING HER OWN BUSINESS,

04:40.321 --> 04:41.906
GETTING LOADED
WITH HER BOYFRIEND,

04:41.990 --> 04:43.408
CLAIMS HER EX-HUSBAND
KNOCKS DOWN THE DOOR.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.995
SAYS THE EX-HUSBAND
WAS JEALOUS AND BORE HER
A GRIEVANCE

04:47.078 --> 04:48.997
'CAUSE SHE DON'T LET HIM
SEE THEIR DAUGHTER.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.292
THIS GUY MUST BE
A REAL CLOCK-STOPPER HIMSELF
TO BE JEALOUS OF THIS BEAST.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.751
SECTOR CAR BROUGHT IN
THE EX-HUSBAND.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.586
HE'S IN THE POKEY.
WE'LL TALK TO HIM NOW.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.796
YOU TALK TO
THE BOYFRIEND?

04:56.838 --> 04:59.257
NO. CONVALESCING
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.967
WE'LL TALK TO HIM LATER.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.969
UH, THIS DETECTIVE SAVINO
FROM BROOKLYN

05:03.011 --> 05:05.805
SAYS THEY GOT A PROBLEM
UP IN THE BUILDING.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.307
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM?

05:07.348 --> 05:08.725
I GOT A TENANT MISSING
FOR 3 DAYS--

05:08.808 --> 05:11.019
THE OLD WOMAN WHO PAID
$135 A MONTH RENT.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.937
THAT MAKES YOU A SUSPECT.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.689
YOU WANT TO TAKE
SOME LOST TIME?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.984
YEAH. SAVINO WANTS ME
TO PEEL MY HEAD CASE SUPER
HENRY OFF THE CEILING.

05:18.026 --> 05:18.985
WE'RE OK.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.904
DON'T LINGER OVER THERE.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.617
YOU HOLDING UP OK,
ANDY?

05:26.701 --> 05:29.037
AS LONG AS
I DON'T HAVE TO LEAP.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.922
I'M DETECTIVE RUSSELL,
EVERETT.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.884
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.385
HOW ROSE'S BOYFRIEND?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.595
HE'S GONNA BE OK.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.139
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.432
BUT I--

05:49.515 --> 05:51.225
I WASN'T THERE
TO HURT NOBODY.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.353
HE WENT AND GOT A GUN.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

05:53.394 --> 05:54.812
I TRIED TO TAKE IT AWAY.
WE WAS FIGHTIN' ON THE FLOOR,

05:54.896 --> 05:56.356
THE GUN JUST WENT OFF.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.815
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOUR EX-WIFE SAYS.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.359
SHE'S GOT YOU
GRABBIN' IT
AND BLASTIN' HIM.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.944
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
NOTHIN' OUT OF HER.
SHE'S A DOPE FIEND.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.946
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT HER APARTMENT?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.199
I COME LOOKING
FOR MY 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
VANESSA.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.910
THAT'S MY CHILD WITH ROSE.
COME ALL THE WAY FROM ATLANTA.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.953
I THINK SOMETHING BAD'S
HAPPENED.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.956
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER
IN 2 MONTHS. I USED TO
TALK TO HER EVERY WEEK.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.459
ROSE SAYS VANESSA WENT
TO LIVE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER
IN CLEVELAND,

06:16.542 --> 06:17.668
BUT THAT'S A LIE.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.587
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S A LIE?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.089
HER GRANDMOTHER
DON'T HAVE HER.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.590
I CALLED THE SCHOOL HERE,

06:22.673 --> 06:25.510
ROSE TOLD THEM
VANESSA WAS LIVING WITH ME.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.930
WHY'D YOU
LEAVE YOUR DAUGHTER WITH
A CRACKHEAD, ANYWAYS?

06:28.971 --> 06:30.765
THE--

06:30.807 --> 06:33.559
THE COURT GAVE HER TO ROSE.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.436
SAID I WAS...

06:35.478 --> 06:37.146
UNFIT. I...

06:37.230 --> 06:39.774
I'D GET SO UPSET WITH ROSE,
I HIT HER.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.110
ROSE DID 3 WEEKS
IN THE REHAB CLINIC

06:42.193 --> 06:43.653
BEFORE THE CUSTODY HEARING.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.947
GAVE THE JUDGE
A GOOD IMPRESSION ON HERSELF.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.448
YOU GOT
THE GRANDMOTHER'S
PHONE NUMBER?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.283
IN MY WALLET.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.577
COPS TOOK IT.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.246
BLANCHE CARLTON--
THAT'S HER NAME.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.498
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO BACK IN THE POKEY
A WHILE.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.041
MAN, I--

06:58.543 --> 07:00.002
I'M NOT LYIN'.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.504
I PROMISE YOU.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.631
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
CHECK YOUR STORY OUT.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.358
WAKE UP.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.484
[KNOCKS ON TABLE]

07:23.526 --> 07:24.986
WE TALKED TO
YOUR EX-HUSBAND

07:25.027 --> 07:27.155
AND JUST SPENT
ABOUT 20 MINUTES
ON THE PHONE, ROSE.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.656
WE GOT A FEW MORE
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.241
Sipowicz:
WHERE'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

07:30.324 --> 07:32.118
I TOLD YOU.
SHE'S IN CLEVELAND
WITH HER GRANDMOTHER.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.787
WE CALLED THERE.
YOUR MOTHER HASN'T SEEN
VANESSA FOR OVER A YEAR.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.415
MY MOTHER IS OLD,
AND SHE'S CRAZY.
VANESSA IS THERE.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.334
DON'T SAY YOUR DAUGHTER
IS IN CLEVELAND AGAIN.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.628
YOU CALL CHILD WELFARE!

07:42.670 --> 07:45.673
I TOLD THEM
THAT'S WHERE SHE'D GONE
2 MONTHS AGO.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.842
WHY'D YOU
TELL HER SCHOOL
VANESSA WENT TO ATLANTA?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.260
THAT SCHOOL'S
ALL MIXED UP.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.720
EVERYBODY'S MIXED UP
BUT YOU.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.182
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME
BECAUSE I DATE INTERRACIAL.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.684
ROSE...

07:56.767 --> 07:58.728
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CHILD?

07:58.811 --> 08:00.062
NOTHING. SHE'S FINE.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.148
EXCEPT SHE FELL OFF
THE FACE OF THE PLANET.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.941
IT'S EVERETT'S
TELLING YOU THAT.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.111
AND I TOLD YOU WHY
I HID HER FROM HIM.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.738
IS YOUR DAUGHTER DEAD?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.573
WHO SAID THAT?

08:10.656 --> 08:11.908
DID YOU KILL HER?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.409
I WOULD NEVER
HURT VANESSA.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.535
I LOVE HER.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.038
THEN WHERE IS SHE?
PROVE SHE'S ALIVE.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.664
YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED,
OR I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SORRY.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.166
I LOVE THAT CHILD!

08:20.208 --> 08:21.834
I WOULD NEVER HARM HER!

08:21.876 --> 08:24.295
WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN
ARE YOU? WHAT KIND OF
A MOTHER ARE YOU?

08:24.378 --> 08:27.590
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.053
YOU SHUT UP.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.141
HE PISSED HIMSELF!

08:37.225 --> 08:39.393
YOU SHUT UP
ABOUT WHAT HE DID.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.395
I NEED THE CELL PHONE,

08:59.080 --> 09:01.582
AND--AND I'LL TELL YOU

09:04.418 --> 09:05.419
HI.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.879

09:06.921 --> 09:09.924
ARE YOU AT THE 2-7?

09:10.007 --> 09:12.426
I HAD AN ACCIDENT,
AND I NEED MORE PANTS,

09:12.510 --> 09:15.429
AND I'M, UH,
EMBARRASSED TO GO OUTSIDE.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.889

09:16.931 --> 09:18.224
I'M IN HERE!

09:19.392 --> 09:21.435

PAIR OF TROUSERS

09:30.361 --> 09:31.821
FROM WHEN I WAS
STAYING IN THE CRIB.

09:31.904 --> 09:35.449
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BORROW THEM.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.535
YEAH, I WOULD.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.536

09:38.619 --> 09:39.662

10:39.430 --> 10:40.723
HER DAUGHTER'S DEAD.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.059
SHE WANTS IMMUNITY
IN EXCHANGE FOR
WHO KILLED THE GIRL,

10:43.142 --> 10:45.436
THE BODY'S DISPOSITION,
AND CHAPTER AND VERSE
HOW IT HAPPENED.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.064
HOW'S SHE GONNA GIVE
CHAPTER AND VERSE
IF SHE WASN'T AN ACCOMPLICE?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.649

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
Cohen: RIGHT NOW,
YOU GOT NO PROOF
OF ANY CRIME,

10:51.567 --> 10:53.486

11:36.612 --> 11:38.948
YOU ALSO OWN
MY AUNT'S BUILDING.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.700
YEAH. I TOOK IT OVER
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.785
SHOULD I TELL HIM
WHAT I TOLD YOU?

11:42.827 --> 11:44.995
YEAH. GO AHEAD.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.789
I BEEN TRYING
TO REACH EDITH 3 DAYS.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.374
I'M CALLING
AND GET NO ANSWER.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.584
I--I GO OVER THERE
TODAY.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.294
NOTHING BUT THE CAT
MEOWING WHEN I KNOCK.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.963
ARE YOU IN REGULAR TOUCH
WITH YOUR AUNT, JERRY,

11:54.046 --> 11:56.966
OR, UH, YOU HAD SOME
SPECIAL REASON YOU WERE
TRYING TO CONTACT HER?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.467
NO REASON IN PARTICULAR.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.969
I...

12:00.010 --> 12:02.471
BY NOW,
THE THIRD DAY OF THIS,

12:02.513 --> 12:03.723
I'M WORRIED, SO...

12:03.806 --> 12:06.642
I GET YOUR BUILDING
MANAGER TO LET ME IN.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.685
HENRY COFFIELD.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.270
YES.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.567
IF MY AUNT MET WITH
FOUL PLAY,

12:14.650 --> 12:17.695
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IF THIS GUY'S INVOLVED.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.071
WELL, HOW'D YOU
COME TO THAT?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.532
LET'S SAY, VERY NEAR

12:21.615 --> 12:23.993
HALF THE TIME
I WOULD CALL MY AUNT,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.829
THAT ONE
WOULD BE IN THERE.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.497
AND HIS TONE WOULD BE
ANTAGONISTIC,

12:28.539 --> 12:30.040
AND WHEN SHE
COMES ON THE LINE,

12:30.124 --> 12:32.042
I'D STILL HEAR BICKERING
BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN THEM.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.544
ARE YOU SAYING
HE WOULD ANSWER THE PHONE?

12:33.627 --> 12:35.880
A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS
IT'D BE HIM PICKING UP.

12:35.963 --> 12:36.964
OW.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.719
SHE MENTION
ANY DISAGREEMENTS
SHE WAS HAVING WITH HIM?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.721
SHE WOULD SAY
HE WAS DIFFICULT,

12:43.804 --> 12:46.348
AND THEN HE'D ASK ME,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER,
ON THE PHONE,

12:46.432 --> 12:49.393
DID I HAVE ANY PLANS
MOVING HER OUT?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.187
WOULD YOU SAY
OFF YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE

12:51.228 --> 12:53.189
THAT SOMETIMES YOUR AUNT
COULD BE DIFFICULT?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.649
MY AUNT COULD BE
A TREMENDOUS PAIN
IN THE BALLS.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.693
BUT THAT DON'T EARN HER
FOUL PLAY.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.070
WELL, LET'S HOPE
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED,
YOU KNOW.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.072
I ASKED JERRY
TO BE THINKING ABOUT
ANY PLACES

13:02.156 --> 13:03.991
HIS AUNT POSSIBLY
COULD HAVE GONE TO.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.409
COME ON, DETECTIVE.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.578
THIS IS
A 78-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
IN FRAIL HEALTH

13:07.661 --> 13:09.079
WHO DON'T GAMBLE.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.623
I MEAN, WHERE IS SHE
GONNA GO?

13:10.706 --> 13:12.541
OW! GOD.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.088
SO YOUR MISSING PERSONS
REPORT'S FILLED OUT?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.090
I'M JUST ABOUT DONE.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.176
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD,
FINISH THAT UP.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.177
THANKS.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.724
TENANTS SAID THIS ONE
WAS ALWAYS MAKING

13:28.808 --> 13:31.560
COMPLICATED HOMICIDAL
THREATS AGAINST HER.

13:31.602 --> 13:35.356
NO, HE'S A JERK,
BUT I'D BE SURPRISED
IF HE HAD MURDER IN HIM.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.071
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

13:42.112 --> 13:43.447
EDITH MURPHY IS MISSING.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.573
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.825
WHEN DID YOU
SEE HER LAST?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.660
LIKE, 3 DAYS AGO.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.411
IS THAT THE LAST
THAT YOU TRIED
TO BE IN TOUCH WITH HER?

13:49.453 --> 13:50.621
NO.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.499
WELL?

13:53.582 --> 13:55.501
I'D GO,
I'D KNOCK ON HER DOOR,

13:55.584 --> 13:57.628
THE LAST 3 DAYS
SHE DIDN'T ANSWER.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.921
AND YOU DIDN'T USE
THE PASSKEY.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.089
SHE FORBADE ME.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.382
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
HENRY?

14:01.423 --> 14:02.842
SHE FORBADE ME
FROM ENTERING HER APARTMENT

14:02.925 --> 14:04.260
WITHOUT HER PERMISSION.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.553
DID YOU CALL HER
ON THE TELEPHONE?

14:05.594 --> 14:07.096
WHY WOULD I TRY
TO CALL HER
ON THE TELEPHONE

14:07.137 --> 14:09.098
WHEN SHE DIDN'T ANSWER
WHEN I WAS KNOCKING?!

14:09.181 --> 14:10.182
SIT DOWN.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.103
SIMONE...

14:14.186 --> 14:15.771
THIS WOMAN SULKED.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.191
IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON
FOR HER TO REFUSE
TO ANSWER HER DOOR,

14:19.275 --> 14:20.776
OR ALSO HER PHONE.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.946
MANY TIMES WHEN
I'D BE IN HER APARTMENT,
SHE'D MAKE ME ANSWER

14:23.988 --> 14:26.365
SO--SO SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.326
SHE--SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO HEAR
NO HEAVY BREATHERS

14:29.410 --> 14:32.830
OR--OR HER DEADBEAT
NEPHEW!

14:32.913 --> 14:34.415
THIS IS JERRY MURPHY?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.125
DEADBEAT JERRY MURPHY.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.793
CORRECT.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.176
LOOKIN' AT ME
FOR DOING HER HARM,

14:46.260 --> 14:48.554
THIS SAVINO'S MAKING
A PROFESSION OF THAT.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.055
YOU SUPPOSE
YOU ANNOUNCING

14:50.139 --> 14:51.473
HOMICIDAL INTENTIONS
TOWARDS EDITH

14:51.515 --> 14:52.975
TO EVERY OTHER TENANT
IN THE BUILDING

14:53.017 --> 14:55.311
MAYBE NUDGED SAVINO
IN THAT DIRECTION?

14:55.352 --> 14:57.438
YOU THINK
I KILLED THIS WOMAN?

14:57.479 --> 14:59.607
I DON'T KNOW, HENRY.
SHE'S MISSING,

14:59.648 --> 15:01.108
AND APPARENTLY
YOU TOLD PEOPLE

15:01.150 --> 15:02.902
THAT YOU WANTED
TO CROAK HER.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.486
SHE WAS GETTING
AFRAID TO GO OUT.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.489
NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO HER.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.117
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
PULLING A SULK ON ME.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.328
I SWEAR, I KNOCKED
ON THAT DOOR

15:12.411 --> 15:14.288
2 OR 3 TIMES A DAY.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.915
YESTERDAY, I CLIMBED
ON A NEIGHBORING ROOF

15:15.998 --> 15:17.583
TRYING TO LOOK IN
WITH BINOCULARS.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.627
THAT'S HOW WORRIED
I WAS.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.923
OH, THAT POOR OLD...
BATTLE-AX.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.842
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THOSE TENANTS NOW.

15:26.884 --> 15:30.220
HEY. TAKE WHAT THEY SAID
WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.351
IDIOT.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.489
CAN I HELP YOU?

15:48.572 --> 15:50.324
[AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
I SAT IN THAT CHAIR.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.992
IS THAT RIGHT?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.912
I WORKED IN EXACTLY
YOUR POSITION
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.121
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

15:56.163 --> 15:57.665
SOMEONE ELSE STOPPED BACK
AND SAID HELLO

15:57.706 --> 15:59.166
WHO WAS A P.A.A.
HERE BEFORE--

15:59.249 --> 16:01.627
SOME GAY GUY WHO'S
IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS NOW.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.381
I, UH, DON'T SEE
DETECTIVE SIMONE
AROUND.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.840
NO. HE'S IN BROOKLYN.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.718
I SORT OF WANTED HIM
TO SEE ME IN UNIFORM.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.720
IS THAT A GOOD APPROACH
WITH HIM?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.847
WELL, I CONFIDED
IN DETECTIVE SIMONE

16:13.931 --> 16:16.433
MY HOPES SOMEDAY TO WORK
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.935
AND WHEN WE LAST
SAW EACH OTHER,

16:18.018 --> 16:19.561
I HAD ENCOUNTERED
AN OBSTACLE,

16:19.645 --> 16:22.690
AND I WANTED HIM TO SEE
HOW I CAME THROUGH.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.359
DO YOU WANT
TO WRITE HIM A NOTE?

16:25.442 --> 16:27.861
OH, I COULDN'T FIND
THE RIGHT WORDS.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.447
IF YOU'D JUST
LET HIM KNOW
I STOPPED.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.534
NAOMI REYNOLDS.

16:33.575 --> 16:38.038
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL
FOR HIS HAND OFFERED
IN FRIENDSHIP...

16:38.080 --> 16:40.541
WHEN SHE VERY MUCH
NEEDED ONE.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.543
WHY DON'T YOU
WRITE THAT?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.472
YOUR ATTORNEY'S MADE CLEAR
ANYTHING YOU TELL US TODAY

16:55.556 --> 16:57.933
CAN'T BE USED IN ANY
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION
AGAINST YOU?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.853
NOR CAN ANYTHING
DIRECTLY DERIVED
FROM WHAT YOU SAY.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.108
I'M READY TO TELL HOW
VANESSA LOST HER LIFE.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.989
OK.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.949
WHEN AND WHERE
DID THE INCIDENT

17:14.033 --> 17:16.118
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DESCRIBE
TAKE PLACE?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.746
NIGHTTIME...

17:18.787 --> 17:20.581
ON MARCH 21
AT MY APARTMENT.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.249
AND WHAT HAPPENED AT
THAT TIME AND PLACE?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.043
I COME HOME FROM
GROCERY SHOPPING,

17:24.084 --> 17:25.919
AND I HEARD
MY BOYFRIEND LONNIE

17:25.961 --> 17:29.256
GRUNTIN' AND CURSIN'
FROM THE BATHROOM.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.383
SO I WENT IN THERE,
AND I SAW...

17:35.596 --> 17:38.557
I SAW THAT HE HAD
A HAMMER IN HIS HAND,

17:38.599 --> 17:41.351
AND HE WAS HOLDING
MY DAUGHTER DOWN
ON THE GROUND

17:41.435 --> 17:44.396
AND BEATING HER ON THE HEAD
WITH THE HAMMER.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.608
WHY WAS HE BEATING
YOUR CHILD?

17:47.649 --> 17:50.611
SHE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH WETTING HERSELF.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.279
AND WHEN I WENT OUT,

17:52.362 --> 17:55.783
SHE HAD DID IT
ON THE COUCH.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.869
AND LONNIE SAID
HE JUST GOT FED UP.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.871
AND HE WAS SMOKING CRACK,

18:00.954 --> 18:03.999
AND HIS TEMPER
GOT THE BEST OF HIM.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.001
THAT WAS HIS PIPE THAT
YOU FOUND THIS MORNING.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.961
WHEN YOU FOUND LONNIE

18:08.045 --> 18:10.798
HITTING YOUR DAUGHTER
IN THE HEAD
WITH A HAMMER,

18:10.839 --> 18:12.424
WHAT DID YOU DO?

18:12.466 --> 18:14.301
I SCREAMED, "WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?"

18:14.343 --> 18:16.637
AND I GRABBED HIS ARM
TO STOP HIM.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.806
AND WHEN
I HAD HIM CONTROLLED,

18:18.889 --> 18:20.974
I PUT MY FINGER...

18:21.058 --> 18:23.811
TO VANESSA'S NECK...

18:23.852 --> 18:25.270
BUT SHE DIDN'T
HAVE NO PULSE.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.730
MY BABY WAS GONE.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.232
SHE HAD DIED...

18:28.315 --> 18:29.900
[SOBBING]

18:32.444 --> 18:34.446
WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU REALIZED

18:34.488 --> 18:36.281
YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS DEAD?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.452
LONNIE SAID
TO HELP HIM

18:40.494 --> 18:43.038
OR HE WOULD
KILL ME, TOO.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.878
SO WE PUT NESSIE
IN A GARBAGE BAG
IN A SUITCASE,

18:49.962 --> 18:53.340
AND LONNIE TOOK
AND PUT IT IN A DUMPSTER

18:53.382 --> 18:54.675
RIGHT UP THE STREET.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.176
WHILE YOU STAYED
IN THE APARTMENT.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.886
HE MADE ME
CLEAN UP THE BLOOD.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.306
AND BEING BY YOURSELF,
YOU DIDN'T CALL THE COPS?

19:01.348 --> 19:03.267
I KNEW IF I EVER
WENT AGAINST LONNIE,

19:03.350 --> 19:04.810
HE WOULD KILL ME, TOO.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.860
THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED
TO VANESSA.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.378
Sylvia: HOW ARE YOU?

19:31.461 --> 19:32.546
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

19:46.351 --> 19:48.187
THANKS.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.820
WHOSE ARE THOSE?

19:56.904 --> 19:57.821
HUH?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.114
OH. MEDAVOY'S.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.409
HE GIVE THEM TO ME
RIGHT AFTER I TALKED TO YOU.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.457
OH...

20:13.587 --> 20:16.215
THIS WOMAN'S INVOLVED
IN KILLING HER CHILD,

20:16.256 --> 20:18.258
AND COHEN
GIVES HER IMMUNITY.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.969
WELL, TO GIVE EVIDENCE
AGAINST AN ACCOMPLICE?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.139
YEAH, HER CRACKHEAD
BOYFRIEND.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.641
WELL, HE MUST HAVE FELT

20:25.724 --> 20:27.351
THAT THERE WASN'T
A CASE WITHOUT HER.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.437
INVOLVED IN KILLING
HER OWN CHILD.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.818
OH...

20:39.238 --> 20:42.324
ANDY, DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT HAVE
COME BACK TOO SOON?

20:42.407 --> 20:43.825
NO.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.077
NO.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.665
WHERE ARE
YOUR OTHER PANTS?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.166
I'LL TAKE THOSE
AND GREG'S

20:51.250 --> 20:52.501
TO THE DRY CLEANER'S.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.294
NO. I'LL DO IT
ON THE WAY HOME.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.013
I WISH IT WAS YOU
WORKING THIS CASE.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.392
IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE I WOULD DO
ANYTHING DIFFERENT.

21:08.475 --> 21:09.643
ANYWAYS,

21:09.726 --> 21:11.436
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.255
LOOK, I DON'T
WRITE GOOD LEFTY,

21:38.338 --> 21:40.507
SO THIS STATEMENT'S
GONNA BE MESSY.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.883
BEFORE YOU WRITE
YOUR STATEMENT

21:41.967 --> 21:43.302
WHAT ROSE'S EX
DID TO YOU THIS MORNING,

21:43.343 --> 21:45.095
WE GOT SOMETHING ELSE
TO TALK ABOUT.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.472
ROSE TOLD US ABOUT
HER DAUGHTER,
LONNIE.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.598
WHAT ABOUT HER?

21:48.682 --> 21:49.850
WHAT ABOUT HER?

21:49.891 --> 21:51.226
WE WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT VANESSA,

21:51.310 --> 21:52.602
AND YOU'D BETTER
TALK FAST.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.646
WHAT IN THE HELL
DID ROSE SAY?

21:54.688 --> 21:56.148
YOU DON'T WORRY
WHAT SHE SAID.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.774
YOU WORRY ABOUT KEEPING
YOURSELF HEALTHY

21:57.858 --> 21:59.276
IN THIS HOSTILE
ENVIRONMENT.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.194
TELL US EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED
TO VANESSA,

22:01.236 --> 22:02.529
OR MY PARTNER'S
GONNA MOVE YOUR ARM

22:02.612 --> 22:04.364
WAY DOWN THE LIST
OF YOUR PHYSICAL
PROBLEMS.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.825
IN NO WAY AM I RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.410
SHE'S NOT MY CHILD,

22:08.493 --> 22:11.997
AND IN NO WAY DO I EVEN
KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.082
I'LL BRING THE WHOLE
DAMN TOOLBOX, ASSHOLE.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.792
I WON'T JUST
BRING THE HAMMER.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.128
OH, GOD.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.255
LOOK. LOOK, CAN I GO
TALK TO HER, PLEASE?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.757
YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.799
I'M GONNA START
TO HURT YOU

22:22.883 --> 22:24.259
LIKE YOU HURT THAT KID.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.844
LOOK, I'M NOT
RESPONSIBLE, MAN.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.888
I WAS ONLY
TRYING TO HELP.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.389
BEATING THAT GIRL
WITH A HAMMER.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.891
LOOK, THE GIRL WAS
GONNA DIE, MAN.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.392
I PUT HER
FROM HER MISERY.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.477
SHUT UP!

22:33.560 --> 22:35.312
OHH!

22:35.395 --> 22:37.731
ALL RIGHT. I CAME
IN THE APARTMENT,

22:37.773 --> 22:39.566
AND ROSE HAD HER
IN THE BATHTUB

22:39.649 --> 22:41.818
WITH HER HEAD
BELOW THE WATER LEVEL,

22:41.902 --> 22:44.237
THAT SHE HAD
HAD IT WITH VANESSA

22:44.279 --> 22:45.822
AND SHE WAS
GONNA DROWN HER.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.408
AND THE LITTLE GIRL'S ARMS,
THEY WAS JUST FLAILING,

22:48.450 --> 22:51.578
AND SHE WAS SUFFERING
AND SHE WAS SUFFOCATING.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.747
AND YOU PITCHED IN
A HELPING HAND, HUH?

22:53.830 --> 22:56.875
BECAUSE ROSE WAS COMMITTED
TO KILLING THAT GIRL

22:56.917 --> 22:59.836
JUST BECAUSE OF HER WETTING
AND STINKING UP THE PLACE.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.506
LOOK, SHE JUST
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

23:02.589 --> 23:04.132
THAT WITH THE HAMMER
HITTING THE WATER,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.593
THAT IT DIDN'T
HAVE NO FORCE.

23:06.676 --> 23:09.346
AND THAT'S
THE ONLY THING I DID.

23:09.429 --> 23:13.517
JUST TOOK VANESSA'S HEAD
OUT FROM THE WATER.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.018
WHERE'S THE BODY?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.186
I PUT IT
IN A BLUE SUITCASE

23:16.269 --> 23:17.979
INSIDE A HEFTY BAG
IN THE CLOSET.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.356
BUT ROSE MUST'VE MOVED IT,

23:19.439 --> 23:20.690
'CAUSE IN THE MORNING,
IT WAS GONE.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.567
YOU WEREN'T WITH HER
THROUGH THE NIGHT?

23:22.609 --> 23:25.695
I KNEW I WASN'T GONNA
BE ABLE TO SLEEP THERE

23:25.779 --> 23:27.280
WITH THE CHILD'S REMAINS.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.448
WHAT DID ROSE SAY
IN THE MORNING

23:28.532 --> 23:29.866
ABOUT THE BODY
BEING GONE?

23:29.950 --> 23:31.952
JUST THAT SHE HAD
TAKEN CARE OF IT.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.541
WRITE IT.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.293
YOU GONNA HAVE SOME TROUBLE
MAKING IT OUT BECAUSE--

23:40.377 --> 23:41.545
WRITE IT!

23:49.052 --> 23:51.221
THE WOMAN
RECEIVED IMMUNITY.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.372
SO, UH, DETECTIVE SAVINO
TELLS ME

24:17.456 --> 24:19.082
THAT SEVERAL OF YOU FEEL

24:19.124 --> 24:21.585
THAT HENRY MAY HAVE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH EDITH'S DISAPPEARANCE?

24:21.668 --> 24:22.752
HENRY COFFIELD,

24:22.836 --> 24:24.546
SUPER OF THIS BUILDING
OWNED BY YOU,

24:24.629 --> 24:26.047
MURDERED EDITH MURPHY.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.716
YOU HAVE NO PROOF
OF THAT, DOREEN.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.800
OH, YOU HEARD HIM
SAY IT MORE THAN ONCE,

24:28.842 --> 24:30.510
AND SO DID
MISS HIGH-AND-MIGHTY.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.137
BEING HE KNOWS ALL OF YOU,

24:32.220 --> 24:35.015
I WANTED DETECTIVE SIMONE
TO HELP SORT THROUGH
YOUR SUSPICIONS.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.349
HE KNOWS US,
DOES HE?

24:36.433 --> 24:37.809
DON'T START WITH THAT
NONSENSE, DORREEN.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.895
I DON'T CALL REPAIRING
A LAUNDRY MACHINE

24:39.978 --> 24:41.688
AND ONE UNDER-DECORATED
CHRISTMAS PARTY

24:41.730 --> 24:43.231
MAKING FRIENDS
WITH THE TENANTS.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.650
HAVE YOU GIVEN HENRY
SOME SORT OF OWNERSHIP
IN THE BUILDING?

24:45.734 --> 24:49.029
UH, YEAH. HE WAS ON
THE MORTGAGE WITH ME
AT THE BANK.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.906
BECAUSE AFTER
HE TOLD ME THAT,

24:50.989 --> 24:52.908
ABOUT GETTING
PART OWNERSHIP
IN THE BUILDING,

24:52.991 --> 24:55.327
THAT'S WHEN
HE STARTED HIS PLANS
FOR MURDERING EDITH.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.705
HE KEPT SAYING
THAT HER RENT
WOULD'VE BEEN LOW

24:58.788 --> 25:00.248
WHEN MILTON BERLE WAS
STILL ON TELEVISION.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.833
Dorreen: TELL HIM
ABOUT THE MILK.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.543
WHAT ABOUT THE MILK?

25:03.585 --> 25:07.047
WELL, HE'D TALK ABOUT
A PLAN HE HAD

25:07.088 --> 25:10.550
WHERE'D HE'D LEAVE
MILK AT HER DOOR
3 TIMES A WEEK,

25:10.634 --> 25:14.054
MAKE HER THINK
THAT THE DAIRY
CONFUSED THE DELIVERY.

25:14.137 --> 25:17.724
EDITH WATCHING
HER DIMES AND QUARTERS,

25:17.766 --> 25:19.559
SHE'D BE HAPPY
AT THE FREE MILK--

25:19.601 --> 25:21.394
FOR HER TEA, AND, UH...

25:21.478 --> 25:23.271
TO GIVE THE TABBY.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.357
Dorreen: AT FIRST,
TO QUASH HER SUSPICIONS,

25:25.398 --> 25:27.234
HE'D LEAVE HER
GOOD PURE MILK,

25:27.317 --> 25:30.654
THEN ADD POISON TILL HE
GOT IT TO A LETHAL DOSE.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.072
Paddy: LAST WEEK,

25:32.155 --> 25:34.908
HE SAID HE'D FOUND A SPOT
ON A ROOF ACROSS THE STREET

25:34.950 --> 25:37.994
WITH A CLEAN LINE OF SIGHT
TO EDITH'S KITCHEN WINDOW.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.664
HE SAID HE HID
A LAWN CHAIR UP THERE

25:40.747 --> 25:43.667
SO HE COULD BE
GOOD AND COMFORTABLE

25:43.750 --> 25:47.212
UNTIL HE GOT HER
BETWEEN THE CROSS HAIRS.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.755
HE ONCE TOLD ME

25:48.797 --> 25:50.966
HE'D CUT HER UP
ONCE HE DONE HER IN

25:51.049 --> 25:53.760
AND BURY THE PIECES
AT A FARM HE KNEW UPSTATE.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.887
I NEVER LET
THE CONVERSATION
GET THAT FAR.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.430
ANY REASON
YOU COULD THINK OF,

25:57.472 --> 25:58.807
IF HE INTENDED
ON KILLING HER,

25:58.890 --> 26:00.684
WHY HE WOULD TALK
ABOUT IT SO MUCH?

26:00.767 --> 26:02.269
WHO WAS THAT MURDERER

26:02.310 --> 26:04.354
WHO BLABBED HIS PLANS
TO ALL THE PAPERS?

26:04.437 --> 26:05.939
THE UNABOMBER.

26:06.022 --> 26:09.609
THANKS. WE APPRECIATE
ALL YOUR INPUT. THANKS.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.778
SO WE'RE DONE?

26:11.820 --> 26:13.113
YEAH.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.410
WE WERE GONNA ASK HIM
ABOUT THE LIGHT
IN THE HALLWAY.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.412
Paddy: NO,
NOT NOW. LATER.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.956
NO, HE DOESN'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT.

26:22.998 --> 26:23.999
[SNARLS]

26:34.718 --> 26:36.386
PICKED UP
THIS ROSE'S SISTER.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.096
RUSSELL'S WITH HER
IN THE POKEY.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.306
I THOUGHT THE EX-HUSBAND
WAS IN THE POKEY.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.640
WELL, HE'S NOT NO MORE.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.225
HE'S IN HOLDING
DOWNSTAIRS.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.269
ANYWAY, GIVEN
THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT,

26:44.311 --> 26:45.895
WHAT YOU GET
FROM THE SISTER

26:45.979 --> 26:47.981
CAN'T IN ANY WAY
BE BASED ON INFORMATION
FROM ROSE'S STATEMENT.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.482
A CASE AGAINST ROSE

26:49.566 --> 26:51.735
ONLY MAKES WITH EVIDENCE
DEVELOPED ABSOLUTELY
INDEPENDENT

26:51.818 --> 26:53.153
OF WHAT SHE GAVE US
IN THAT INTERVIEW.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.404
I'M GONNA GO
TALK TO HER.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.780
DOES DETECTIVE RUSSELL
UNDERSTAND THAT?

26:55.822 --> 26:57.991
YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT
TO USE THAT TONE WITH ME.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.200
GO AHEAD AND TALK
TO HER, ANDY.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.371
BELIEVE ME, WE TRY
AND PROSECUTE,

27:03.455 --> 27:05.332
THIS WOMAN'S LAWYER'S
GONNA GO OVER EVERY INCH

27:05.415 --> 27:07.334
OF WHAT YOUR PEOPLE DO
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD

27:07.417 --> 27:11.296
FOR PREDICATE INFORMATION
HARVESTED FROM HIS CLIENT'S
STATEMENT.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.380
WOW.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.260
THIS IS DETECTIVE
SIPOWICZ, SANDRA.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.762
THIS DETECTIVE SAYS

27:18.845 --> 27:20.513
THIS IS ABOUT MY NIECE
BEING MISSING.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.682
WE SPOKE WITH
YOUR SISTER'S
EX-HUSBAND,

27:22.724 --> 27:24.184
AND THAT WAS
HIS CONCERN.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.935
WELL, WHAT DOES ROSE SAY?

27:28.021 --> 27:29.481
JUST NOW, WE'RE INTERESTED

27:29.522 --> 27:30.899
IN ANY LIGHT
YOU CAN SHED, SANDRA.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.192
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT

27:32.275 --> 27:35.278
EXCEPT TO SAY VANESSA'S
A VERY NICE GIRL.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.530
MY SISTER AND I
AREN'T CLOSE.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.532
ACTUALLY,
SHE'S MY HALF-SISTER.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.034
IS THAT
A RECENT THING,

27:41.117 --> 27:42.535
THE TWO OF YOU
NOT BEING CLOSE?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.789
ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY
PROBLEMS SHE HAS?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.207
WE KNOW AT YOUR SISTER'S
APARTMENT THIS MORNING,

27:47.290 --> 27:49.209
HER EX-HUSBAND
AND HER BOYFRIEND
HAD A FIGHT

27:49.292 --> 27:51.378
AND HER BOYFRIEND WAS
SHOT IN THE SHOULDER
WITH HIS OWN GUN.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.713
CRACK WAS BEING SMOKED
AT THAT APARTMENT.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.799
ARE YOU AWARE
OF YOUR SISTER'S
INVOLVEMENT WITH THAT?

27:55.882 --> 27:57.634
I HAVE NO USE FOR DRUGS.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.844
SANDRA, YOUR SISTER'S
EX-HUSBAND CAME UP
FROM ATLANTA

27:59.886 --> 28:01.388
BECAUSE HE TRIED
TO REACH HIS DAUGHTER

28:01.471 --> 28:03.765
AND HE HADN'T BEEN ABLE
TO TALK TO VANESSA
IN A LONG TIME.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.225
WHAT DOES MY SISTER
SAY ABOUT ALL THIS?

28:05.266 --> 28:06.351
WHAT DO YOU
SAY ABOUT IT?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.519
PLEASE DON'T SCARE ME.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.020
WE NEED YOUR HELP
WITH THIS.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.691
DO YOU THINK
VANESSA'S DEAD?

28:12.732 --> 28:14.192
NO ONE'S
HEARD FROM VANESSA

28:14.234 --> 28:15.902
OR SEEN HER
IN SEVERAL MONTHS.

28:15.985 --> 28:19.072
OH, MY GOD.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.032
WELL, DID SHE JUST DIE?

28:21.116 --> 28:22.575
I MEAN...

28:22.659 --> 28:24.577
THEY DIDN'T KILL HER,
DID THEY?

28:24.661 --> 28:27.831
YOU MEAN ROSE
AND HER BOYFRIEND?

28:27.914 --> 28:29.666
I KNOW SHE LEFT
HER HUSBAND

28:29.749 --> 28:31.459
BECAUSE HE DISAPPROVED
OF HER CRACK USE,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.670
AND I KNOW THIS ONE
SMOKES IT WITH HER.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.172
ARE YOU AWARE OF THEM
ABUSING THAT GIRL?

28:36.256 --> 28:38.091
SHE'S NOT SATISFIED
RUINING HER OWN LIFE.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.592
SHE GOTTA RUIN IT
FOR EVERYONE AROUND HER.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.761
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT,
SANDRA?

28:41.845 --> 28:43.388
LOOK, I HAVE
NO INFORMATION FOR YOU.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.724
I DON'T HAVE TO DO
WITH MY SISTER.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.559
I'VE SEEN HER ONCE
IN 4 MONTHS.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.018
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
YOU SAW HER THEN?

28:49.102 --> 28:51.771
NOTHING.
SHE BORROWED MY CAR.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.899
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WENT?

28:54.941 --> 28:55.984
NO, I DON'T.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.736
CAME BACK WITH
NEXT TO AN EMPTY TANK.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.071
I COUNTED MYSELF LUCKY
I GOT IT BACK AT ALL.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.531
HOW LONG
WAS SHE GONE?

29:01.614 --> 29:03.324
UM, NOT SURE.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.493
UH...6 HOURS MAYBE.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.661
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE DID

29:06.745 --> 29:08.580
OR WHERE SHE WENT
OR ANYTHING ELSE,

29:08.621 --> 29:10.915
AND I DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'
ABOUT VANESSA.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.792
MY SISTER
JUST FIGHTS WITH ME,

29:12.876 --> 29:14.294
AND THAT'S WHY
I DON'T SEE HER.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.670
WHAT DOES SHE FIGHT
WITH YOU ABOUT?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.297
SHE SAYS
I'M RACIALLY BIGOTED,

29:17.380 --> 29:19.549
BUT I'M NOT RACIALLY
BIGOTED AT ALL.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.510
I DISAPPROVE OF HER
USING THE CRACK,

29:22.594 --> 29:24.971
BUT SHE MAKES IT
ABOUT THE OTHER THING.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.433
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT CAR TRIP,

29:28.475 --> 29:29.768
AND YOU'RE
HOLDING IT BACK.

29:29.809 --> 29:30.727
NO, I DON'T--

29:30.810 --> 29:31.978
YOU LOAN YOUR CAR

29:32.020 --> 29:33.438
TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T SEE
FOR MONTHS AT A TIME,

29:33.480 --> 29:34.898
AND YOU DON'T ASK HER
WHERE SHE'S GOING?

29:34.981 --> 29:36.274
I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.984
THEN WHAT'D YOU
LEND HER THE CAR FOR
AT ALL?

29:38.067 --> 29:39.611
I DON'T KNOW! WHY DON'T YOU
ASK ROSE THESE THINGS?

29:39.652 --> 29:41.946
'CAUSE WE'RE ASKING YOU!

29:41.988 --> 29:44.657
NOW YOU'VE MADE ME CRY.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.743
ALL RIGHT, SANDRA.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.244
I TRY TO LEAD
A DECENT LIFE.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.245
ALL RIGHT.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.414
WE'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

29:51.456 --> 29:55.335
ROSE GOT HERSELF A TICKET
IN SOME NATIONAL PARK
IN QUEENS.

29:57.837 --> 29:59.839
I FOUND THE TICKET IN MY CAR
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.717
GOOD, SANDRA. WE CAN LOOK UP
WHERE SHE GOT THE TICKET.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.013
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHERE
SHE MUST'VE BEEN.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.266
THANKS A LOT
FOR HELPING US.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.220
IT'S TALK, SIMONE.

32:11.262 --> 32:14.515
I WENT UP ON THAT OTHER
BUILDING'S ROOF AFTER,
HENRY.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.934
I FOUND YOUR LAWN CHAIR.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.436
I GO UP THERE
AND SMOKE REEFER.

32:18.519 --> 32:23.107
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
BEING ON THE ROOF.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.443
HENRY, DO I THINK
THAT YOU KILLED
EDITH MURPHY? NO.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.112
DO I THINK THAT
YOU'RE AN IDIOT
WITH A BIG MOUTH?

32:28.196 --> 32:30.907
YOU GET NO ARGUMENT
FROM ME.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.033
[SIGHS]

32:33.326 --> 32:35.662
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS NEPHEW
COULD'VE BEEN INVOLVED?

32:35.745 --> 32:36.996
ABSOLUTELY.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.499
HE'S THE ONE
YOU SHOULD PIN IT ON.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.292
WE'RE NOT GONNA PIN IT ON HIM
IF HE DIDN'T DO IT.

32:41.334 --> 32:45.171
I MEAN PIN IT ON
IN THE SENSE THAT HE'S
THE MOST LIKELY CULPRIT.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.131
BECAUSE...

32:47.173 --> 32:49.133
BECAUSE HE'S A HUMP

32:49.217 --> 32:52.470
AND A TUBE-STEAK
PARASITE...

32:52.553 --> 32:54.138
ALWAYS
AFTER HER MONEY.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.933
SHE EVER SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING AFRAID OF HIM?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.768
THE ONLY THING
THAT WOMAN'S AFRAID OF

32:58.851 --> 33:00.561
IS HEAVY BREATHERS
ON THE PHONE.

33:01.854 --> 33:04.649
AM I GONNA BE HELD
IN CUSTODY?

33:04.732 --> 33:07.485
IT'S GONNA BE UP
TO DETECTIVE SAVINO.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.780
YOU DON'T MIND PUTTING IN
A GOOD WORD FOR ME, DO YOU?

33:20.540 --> 33:22.333
THEY JUST FOUND HER
DEAD...

33:22.375 --> 33:23.876
UNDER THE WESTSIDE
HIGHWAY.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.965
WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T
TELL THIS ONE,

33:29.048 --> 33:30.967
LET HIM GO, SEE IF
HE GOES OVER THERE.

33:31.050 --> 33:34.804
YEAH. I DON'T THINK
HE DID IT.

33:34.887 --> 33:38.474
HOW OFTEN DO YOU FIND
AN I.D. ON A DUMP JOB?

33:38.558 --> 33:41.102
WHEN THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW
THE VICTIM'S DEAD.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.994
THIS IS SYLVIA COSTAS
FROM MY OFFICE.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.537
ANYTHING FURTHER
FROM MY CLIENT

33:59.620 --> 34:02.540
IS COVERED BY HER
IMMUNITY AGREEMENT.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.043
THAT IMMUNITY AGREEMENT
COVERS EXACTLY NOTHING

34:05.126 --> 34:06.669
BECAUSE YOUR CLIENT'S
A LIAR.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.379
I'VE TOLD NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.215
YOU KEEP QUIET TILL I
EXPLAIN YOUR SITUATION
TO YOUR LAWYER.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.467
WHO DIED
AND MADE YOU POPE?

34:12.550 --> 34:14.093
LET'S HEAR WHAT
THEY HAVE TO SAY.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.138
I'M NOT EVEN
GOING TO DISCUSS
THE PROPRIETY

34:17.221 --> 34:19.557
OF THIS AGREEMENT'S
BEING OFFERED
TO BEGIN WITH.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.017
BUT WHAT YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND

34:21.059 --> 34:23.978
IS THAT EVIDENCE
DEVELOPED INDEPENDENT
OF HER STATEMENT

34:24.020 --> 34:25.396
MAKES HER INDICTABLE.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.482
YOU SAID A SIGNED AGREEMENT
WAS UNBREAKABLE.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.733
IT IS.

34:28.816 --> 34:32.236
YOU GOT A MOVING VIOLATION,
MARCH 22, IN QUEENS.

34:32.278 --> 34:33.404
3 HOURS AGO,

34:33.446 --> 34:35.239
CADAVER DOGS FOUND
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BODY

34:35.281 --> 34:37.992
75 YARDS FROM WHERE
THE TICKET WAS ISSUED.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.660
YOUR BOYFRIEND LONNIE

34:39.744 --> 34:43.498
REMEMBERS YOUR DAUGHTER
BEING MURDERED
ON MARCH 21.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.665
MY BOYFRIEND LONNIE

34:44.707 --> 34:46.292
DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT YEAR IT IS.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.418
BE QUIET, ROSE.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.462
HE REMEMBERED THE DATE
EXACTLY, ROSE.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.089
AND WE'VE GOT
A WITNESS NOW

34:51.172 --> 34:53.591
THAT PUTS YOU WHERE
VANESSA'S BODY WAS
BURIED THE NEXT DAY.

34:53.674 --> 34:54.884
WHAT WITNESS?

34:54.967 --> 34:57.220
THE COP THAT GAVE YOU
THE TICKET, YOU MORON.

34:57.261 --> 35:00.264
THAT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL
AND ALSO IRRELEVANT
TO THE CAPITAL CRIME.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.600
I'M DYING TO WATCH YOU
IN COURT

35:02.642 --> 35:04.435
TRY TO PRESERVE
AN IMMUNITY AGREEMENT

35:04.519 --> 35:06.687
THAT DIDN'T PRODUCE
ONE OUNCE OF TRUTH,

35:06.771 --> 35:09.440
INCLUDING WHERE SHE
DISPOSED OF THE REMAINS,

35:09.524 --> 35:12.777
FROM A MOTHER WHO
BRAINED HER DAUGHTER
FOR WETTING HERSELF.

35:12.860 --> 35:15.530
I HAD TO GO GET
A SPIC LEGAL AID.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.284
WELL, WHAT ARE THEY
OFFERING ME NOW?

35:22.662 --> 35:25.456
FOR FULL TESTIMONY...

35:25.540 --> 35:28.543
5 YEARS WITH TREATMENT
FOR HER DRUG ADDICTION.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.255
HOW ABOUT WITH NO TREATMENT?

35:56.112 --> 35:57.446
[SIGHS]

35:57.488 --> 35:59.782
I GOT BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, McCRAE.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.117
[EXHALES SHARPLY]

36:03.286 --> 36:04.787
I-IS VANESSA GONE?

36:06.831 --> 36:10.293
YOUR EX-WIFE AND THAT BOYFRIEND
YOU HAD A BEEF WITH

36:10.334 --> 36:12.795
DID AWAY WITH HER
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.338
OHH.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.800
PLEASE HELP ME,
JESUS.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.511
I'M SORRY.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.514
W-WAS IT THE CRACK
MOVED HER TO DO IT?

36:23.598 --> 36:27.476
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.646
MOVED HER TO KILL
HER OWN BLOOD?

36:30.730 --> 36:33.191
KILL OUR CHILD?

36:33.274 --> 36:35.693
OHH.

36:36.652 --> 36:37.820
THIS HERE,

36:37.862 --> 36:39.405
THE D.A.'s NOT
GONNA PROSECUTE YOU

36:39.488 --> 36:41.699
ON THE TROUBLE
IN THAT APARTMENT.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.535
WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE
AS SOON AS THE PAPERWORK'S
THROUGH.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.787
WHEN CAN I GET
MY DAUGHTER?

36:46.829 --> 36:50.917
THE M.E.
HAD TO DO SOME STUFF.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.171
WE'LL GET HER REMAINS
RELEASED TO YOU
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.842
HAVE YOU GOT THE MEANS
TO SEE TO HER?

37:02.345 --> 37:04.931
I GOTTA GO GET MONEY
FOR THAT.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.767
NOW, DON'T DO NOTHIN'
STUPID.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.311
ARE YOU...
CHURCH-AFFILIATED?

37:11.938 --> 37:14.941
EBENEZER BAPTIST.

37:15.024 --> 37:17.276
I HAVEN'T LIVED THERE,
THOUGH, IN 3 YEARS.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.945
WELL, REACH OUT TO THEM,

37:19.028 --> 37:20.905
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE,
GET BACK TO US,

37:20.988 --> 37:22.740
AND WE'LL SEE CAN WE HELP.

37:27.411 --> 37:31.207
THEY'LL BE DOWN FOR YOU
AS SOON AS THE PAPERWORK'S
THROUGH.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.106
CAN I HELP YOU?

37:55.189 --> 37:56.941
OH, JERRY.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.734
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.444
THERE'S NEWS ON EDITH?

38:00.486 --> 38:02.738
UH, YEAH, ON A COUPLE
OF DIFFERENT FRONTS.
HAVE A SEAT.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.117
A--SHE MIGHT BE
IN BINGHAMTON.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.618
BINGHAMTON?

38:07.702 --> 38:10.788
A WOMAN YOUR AUNT'S
DESCRIPTION EXACTLY

38:10.830 --> 38:13.124
TURNS UP
AT A BUS STATION THERE
ABOUT 2 DAYS AGO--

38:13.165 --> 38:14.750
NO PURSE,
TOTAL AMNESIA.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.460
I'M GONNA BE SURPRISED
IF THAT'S EDITH.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.462
SHE NEVER MENTIONED
BINGHAMTON IN HER LIFE.

38:18.504 --> 38:19.463
THE OTHER FRONT--

38:19.547 --> 38:21.465
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS ANIMOSITY

38:21.507 --> 38:23.926
BETWEEN HER
AND THAT HENRY COFFIELD?

38:24.010 --> 38:26.262
TELL BINGHAMTON
TAKE A SNAPSHOT
AND SEND IT DOWN,

38:26.345 --> 38:27.805
AND I'LL I.D.
IF IT'S NOT HER.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.140
THIS OTHER FRONT--

38:29.181 --> 38:31.183
WE FOUND A WILL
IN YOUR AUNT'S APARTMENT

38:31.267 --> 38:33.144
WHERE SHE LEAVES HIM
HER ESTATE.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.145
TO WHO?

38:34.228 --> 38:35.187
HENRY COFFIELD.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.940
THAT DOCUMENT'S
A FORGERY.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.650
WHAT'S THE DATE
ON THAT DOCUMENT?

38:39.692 --> 38:40.985
I'D HAVE TO LOOK.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.611
I HAVE A DOCUMENT
DATED 4 DAYS AGO

38:42.653 --> 38:43.779
SHOWED UP
IN MY MAIL.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.489
WELL, WHO'S THE BENEFICIARY
IN THAT ONE?

38:45.531 --> 38:46.991
MYSELF.

38:47.074 --> 38:49.827
AND I'LL CONTEST
ANY DOCUMENT SUPPOSED
TO BE MORE RECENT.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.662
JERRY...

38:51.704 --> 38:52.872
IN BROOKLYN,

38:52.955 --> 38:54.623
YOU SAY,
"NO SPECIAL REASON,"

38:54.707 --> 38:57.418
WHEN I ASK YOU WHY YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR YOUR AUNT.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.503
A NORMAL NEPHEW LOOKING
TO TALK TO HIS AUNT?

38:59.545 --> 39:01.672
SHE SIGNED HER ESTATE
OVER TO YOU 4 DAYS AGO.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.674
I WAS FOLLOWING UP
TO SEE HOW SHE WAS DOING.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.177
JERRY, WHY DID EDITH
MAKE OUT THAT WILL?

39:06.260 --> 39:09.055
SAID SHE WANTED
HER AFFAIRS IN ORDER.

39:09.138 --> 39:12.308
LOOK,
ARE YOU ADDRESSING ME
STILL AS HER LANDLORD

39:12.391 --> 39:14.852
OR AS A DETECTIVE,
OR WHAT?

39:14.935 --> 39:18.022
NO. HE'S GONNA BE
ADDRESSING YOU
AS A DETECTIVE.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.357
DETECTIVE SAVINO.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.317
WE FOUND
YOUR AUNT'S BODY

39:21.400 --> 39:22.651
BY THE WESTSIDE
HIGHWAY, JERRY.

39:22.693 --> 39:23.819
HUH.

39:23.903 --> 39:24.862
MMM. YEAH.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.113
I.D. STILL ON IT.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.449
YOU KNOW, LIKE SOMEBODY
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

39:28.532 --> 39:29.533
WE'D KNOW WHO IT WAS.

39:29.575 --> 39:30.534
POOR EDITH.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.036
POOR JERRY.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.163
NO PATIENCE TO DO
A HOMICIDE RIGHT.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.831
WANTS TO GET THE WHEELS
TURNING RIGHT AWAY

39:35.915 --> 39:37.541
ON GETTING
HIS AUNT'S ESTATE.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.835
THAT'S SOME LEAP ON YOUR PART
ACCUSING ME OF SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.837
YOU KNOW
HOW MANY VAGRANTS
ARE ON THE EYE

39:41.921 --> 39:43.547
AROUND WHERE YOU
DUMPED YOUR AUNT,
JERRY?

39:43.589 --> 39:45.674
HUH?
LOOKING TO EARN?

39:45.716 --> 39:47.009
3 DIFFERENT
HOMELESS PEOPLE

39:47.051 --> 39:49.345
SAW YOU PUT YOUR AUNT
OVER THERE.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.972
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T LOOK
THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
FROM HENRY COFFIELD.

39:52.014 --> 39:54.475
JERRY, THE PERSON THAT THEY
DESCRIBED HAD LONG HAIR.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.018
HENRY COFFIELD IS BALD.

39:56.060 --> 39:56.894
YOU NEVER HEARD
OF A WIG?

39:56.977 --> 39:58.729
WANT US TO BRING
THESE GUYS IN,

39:58.771 --> 40:00.189
HAVE EACH ONE
PICK YOU OUT?

40:00.272 --> 40:03.192
LOSE YOUR OPPORTUNITY
TO SHOW YOUR REMORSE
TO THE JUDGE.

40:07.029 --> 40:09.657
WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR LETTING
A BUNCH OF HOMELESS BUMS

40:09.740 --> 40:12.243
SEE ME DUMPING EDITH.

40:12.326 --> 40:15.955
EXCUSE ME FOR NOT BEING
A PROFESSIONAL MURDERER.

40:16.038 --> 40:17.790
LET'S YOU AND ME
WORK OUT

40:17.873 --> 40:20.751
THE BEST LIGHT
TO SHOW THIS IN,
ALL RIGHT?

40:22.086 --> 40:23.587
OHH...

40:26.632 --> 40:28.717
HE ADMIT IT?

40:28.759 --> 40:30.094
THE SON OF A BITCH!

40:30.136 --> 40:32.346
HENRY, SAVINO IS IN THERE
GETTING JERRY'S STATEMENT.

40:32.430 --> 40:36.600
LOUSE THAT UP, AND NEXT
THEY'LL BE TAKING MINE
ABOUT WHAT I DID TO YOU.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.689
SO YOU DIDN'T NEED ME
TO LIE TO JERRY

40:41.772 --> 40:44.525
ABOUT HER MAKING
THE WILL TO ME?

40:44.608 --> 40:48.070
GAVE US CONFIDENCE JUST
KNOWING YOU WERE AVAILABLE.

40:48.154 --> 40:52.658
I...I FEEL SO BAD ABOUT
THIS OLD BATTLE-AX.

40:52.741 --> 40:55.828
YOU AND HER WERE
GETTING ALONG BETTER
TOWARDS THE END, HUH?

40:55.911 --> 41:00.082
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
GOTTEN ALONG BETTER WITH.

41:00.166 --> 41:04.462
ME GIVING HER MEANNESS
BACK TO HER HOW I DID,

41:04.545 --> 41:07.756
I THINK THAT WAS A RELIEF
TO EDITH.

41:07.798 --> 41:12.553
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO FEEL
ALL REMORSEFUL AFTERWARD

41:12.636 --> 41:14.138
LIKE SHE DID
WITH NORMAL PEOPLE

41:14.221 --> 41:18.726
ABOUT...BEING SUCH
A BATTLE-AX HERSELF.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.484
I'M HUMILIATED
ABOUT TALKING
TO THOSE BUSYBODIES

41:26.567 --> 41:27.818
ABOUT MURDERING HER.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.236
THEY'LL FIND OUT
IT WASN'T YOU.

41:31.071 --> 41:33.574
HOW THAT TALK
DEVELOPED...

41:35.409 --> 41:38.329
YOU PUT MY NAME CO-OWNER
OF THAT BUILDING,

41:38.412 --> 41:41.499
AND HER ONLY PAYING
$135 A MONTH RENT.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.667
NOW WHEN I SMOKE
MY REEFER,

41:43.751 --> 41:45.669
I GOTTA RUN OFF
MY MOUTH

41:45.753 --> 41:50.549
WITH MY MOPE LOSER IDEA
HOW A CO-OWNER TALKS.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.513
I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE,
SIMONE.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.308
IF YOU CAN'T BE KIND
ABOUT THE PEOPLE

41:59.350 --> 42:01.352
YOU FEEL KINDNESS
TOWARD,
YOU'RE NO DAMN GOOD.

42:02.478 --> 42:04.980
THE WAY I LOOK
AT THAT, HENRY,

42:05.022 --> 42:06.899
IF WE'RE STILL
DRAWING BREATH,

42:06.982 --> 42:09.985
WE GOT A CHANCE
TO DO SOMETHING
ON OUR SHORTCOMINGS

42:10.027 --> 42:11.278
BESIDES PISS AND MOAN.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.203
YOU GONNA SEE TO EDITH'S
ARRANGEMENTS?

42:21.872 --> 42:22.998
YEAH.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.878
THANK YOU.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.561
[YAWNS]

42:44.853 --> 42:46.522
HE ASLEEP?

42:48.524 --> 42:49.525
MM-HMM.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.533
[SIGHS]

42:59.827 --> 43:02.037
YOU WERE GANGBUSTERS
TODAY.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.459
YOU WERE HARD
ON LEO, ANDY.

43:07.543 --> 43:12.590
TCH. I'M 30 YEARS LATE
FOR BEING HARD ENOUGH
ON LEO.

43:12.673 --> 43:16.927
I TOLD YOU I WOULD'VE MADE
THE EXACT SAME DEAL LEO DID.

43:16.969 --> 43:20.764
I MEAN, YOU REALIZE THAT
MY PUTTING THE KNOCK ON HIM
FOR MAKING THAT DEAL,

43:20.806 --> 43:23.142
THAT WAS JUST TO INTIMIDATE
THAT WOMAN.

43:23.225 --> 43:27.855
IN OTHER WORDS,
THIS WAS A FORM OF
PROSECUTORIAL DECEPTION.

43:32.985 --> 43:35.946
AND THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.535
YOU'RE WELCOME.
