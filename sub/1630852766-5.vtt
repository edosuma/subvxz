00:06.807 --> 00:09.475
What playboy is really all about
and what hefner is all about is
trying to say,

00:10.711 --> 00:11.677
let's celebrate our sexuality.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.814
It is fun when you first have
sex, right?

00:16.917 --> 00:20.152
But he needed to
experience it all.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.422
There's a line that's crossed.
It made me sick to my stomach.

00:24.925 --> 00:25.991
It just got to be a circus.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.727
I think for men like
hef, over time,

00:29.630 --> 00:31.997
it takes more to be turned on.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.098
Ben wa balls,

00:34.001 --> 00:36.969
sex trapezes, sex with dogs.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.906
These men needed to try things
that were more transgressive.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.911
And that rush came from finding
these girls that were very

00:47.848 --> 00:52.217
innocent and naive and slowly
watching them do things that
they never

00:52.319 --> 00:54.620
thought they would do before.
Really just breaking them down.

00:55.823 --> 00:59.191
This is beyond having fun
partying. He was like a vampire.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.629
He was sucking the life out of
me. Really, he was a monster.

01:04.899 --> 01:08.434
The things that he got turned on
by, nothing was enough, nothing.

01:13.641 --> 01:14.873
My name is hugh hefner, I'm
editor/publisher of playboy
magazine.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.343
Hugh hefner was just
27, he fashioned himself

01:18.446 --> 01:22.381
and playboy as the face
of sexual liberation.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.683
Playboy is one of the most
famous brand names in the world.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.655
I would like to be remembered as
somebody who played some
positive part in

01:29.757 --> 01:30.689
changing the social
sexual values of my time.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.461
I believe that hef pulled
one over on the whole world.

01:38.332 --> 01:42.134
The fantasy of playboy that he
created did not allow for the
consent of the women.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.472
When it came to hefner's
buddies, you had to keep those
secrets quiet.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.208
What have you got for free?

01:49.310 --> 01:52.644
When you get someone that
powerful, anything could happen,
anything!

01:54.648 --> 01:56.315
The people who are really there,
they're the ones who know the
real truth.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.219
I want be a voice for the women
that suffered the most at his
hands.

02:00.955 --> 02:08.527
[dramatic music]

02:17.304 --> 02:21.707
this was commissioned by one of
the art directors on our third
anniversary.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.109
And it's hef and sondra
three fabulous years,

02:25.045 --> 02:26.712
but I can't hate my house.
It's just,

02:27.915 --> 02:30.449
it goes against everything that
I'm trying to do right now.

02:32.153 --> 02:35.287
Trying to get the word out,
just for girls, young girls

02:35.389 --> 02:38.657
to be careful with the decisions
they make and what they give
away.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.528
Even though he's gone, there's
going to be another one in
history.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.028
They're out there,
there always is.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.497
This subject matter is
a little touchy for me.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.036
[music]

02:51.705 --> 02:52.571
I was so innocent.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.809
That's sondra theodore,
a rather special lady.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.313
Between you and me, is she going
to be playmate of the year? You
can tell me.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.315
Well, not this year,
dick, maybe next.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.753
See, they're talking about what
a wholesome girl I was. And I
was.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.790
When I first met sondra
theodore at the la mansion,

03:11.892 --> 03:14.226
she was only 19 years old.
She was very young.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.498
She was angelic, and she was
sweet, and she was absolutely
beautiful.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.000
And she was always
standing next to hefner.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.339
Sondra, she truly loved him.
Even though at that time I
didn't know her well,

03:28.576 --> 03:29.041
I could just sense it.

03:30.477 --> 03:34.513
She met hef and just from
the get go, loved hef.

03:40.387 --> 03:45.257
Honestly, he probably should
have married sondra because she
genuinely loved him.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.527
My name is sondra theodore,

03:48.629 --> 03:52.130
and I was hef's girlfriend in
the seventies and early eighties
for five years.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.234
It was like living
in a fairy tale, and

03:58.172 --> 04:00.806
he made me believe it,
and everybody else did too.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.276
'cause I don't know if they all
felt like it was a fairy tale
too,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.612
that we were so in love.

04:10.117 --> 04:14.152
I would've never thought she
would speak about hef because
boy was

04:14.255 --> 04:15.153
she loyal to him.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.924
[music]

04:19.960 --> 04:23.428
looking back, I don't
know how I fell for this.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.032
I don't know, it's
like baffling. Hefner,

04:28.235 --> 04:30.302
he broke me like you
would break a horse.

04:33.207 --> 04:36.508
He scared me a lot at the end
because you couldn't satisfy
him.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.079
He had to more and more and
more, you know, pretty wild.

04:42.916 --> 04:43.181
I couldn't tell anybody.

04:44.685 --> 04:48.920
I would be horrified to tell my
parents what had been going on.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.690
I didn't want them to know that.
I didn't want anybody to know
that,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.659
and I'm sitting here telling
you; that was my big secret.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.031
I was a good kid.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.470
I started piano when I
was seven, and I loved it.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.675
My parents were strict. They
made me practice before school
and after school,

05:11.879 --> 05:15.180
but I never once wanted to quit.
In high school, I focused on my
studies.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.117
I was going to become an
actress, and I was a bible
school teacher.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.890
I was just a really, really good
girl that had really high hopes
and dreams, and

05:25.592 --> 05:29.361
I pursued them until I met hef.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.501
When I first went up to the
mansion, I really did not know.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.706
I didn't have the concept of
who he was. I looked so happy,

05:40.808 --> 05:41.873
but I had no idea what
I was walking into.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.345
I told my mother that I was
going to howard hughes's house,
and she said,

05:48.215 --> 05:51.550
he's dead. And I said, well,
there's another guy with hh in
his name.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.484
And I said, oh
yeah, hugh hefner.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.520
And they're like, "oh no, no,
no, no, no, don't go there.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.989
Don't go there." but I
said, "mom,

05:58.092 --> 06:00.892
don't be silly." and I went with
my high school best friend, and
we were going

06:02.596 --> 06:04.629
together, and we were coming
home together. That was the
deal.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.301
When I first met hef, he had
broken up with barbi benton,

06:11.505 --> 06:14.172
and I learned that through the
photographs in the hall, the
gallery,

06:15.743 --> 06:19.311
that their life looked
like magic. I mean,

06:19.413 --> 06:22.848
they have a picture in gatsby
dress with the backdrop of the
house, and it

06:22.950 --> 06:24.649
looked like, wow,
he really loved her.

06:27.921 --> 06:32.457
And I still didn't
understand really that

06:33.594 --> 06:34.593
he was a playboy.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.032
This is my best friend
from high school.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.102
And bernie was the prettiest
girl in high school.

06:45.739 --> 06:50.208
And I was this nerdy little girl
with my coronated skirt, my
vest,

06:50.310 --> 06:53.845
and even my daughter would say,
"mom, you were such a geek." you
know,

06:53.947 --> 06:55.080
she sees my pictures that I
was, I was such a geek.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.715
[laughs]

06:58.952 --> 07:01.052
I've never been to a
hollywood party at that point.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.790
It was a big, big deal.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.392
He really knew how
to work the charm.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.663
The seduction was fast, and he
just really reeled me in that
first night

07:13.400 --> 07:15.100
'cause he said, "I've looked
the whole party over,

07:18.405 --> 07:20.605
and you're the one I want to
spend the evening with. Will you
stay?"

07:23.644 --> 07:25.944
those words alone, "I looked the
whole party over, and I'm the
one."

07:26.346 --> 07:27.979
and

07:30.350 --> 07:33.452
I couldn't even speak, but I had
a smile on my face I guess
because he said,

07:33.554 --> 07:35.153
I'll take that smile as a yes.

07:38.292 --> 07:42.861
Just all of it just make me feel
special. I was 19, and he was
50,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.933
and I had not been
in bed with a man.

07:50.871 --> 07:54.573
His secretary was joni mattis.
She was a playmate at one point.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.312
He told joni to make sure I
stayed right there so he could
find me again.

08:00.414 --> 08:01.279
He had to go say
goodnight to his guests.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.484
And then he came back,
and he took me upstairs.

08:06.053 --> 08:11.756
[music]

08:11.859 --> 08:15.760
hef was my first real
relationship where

08:17.531 --> 08:20.699
it was a real, it was a love
affair, and he nurtured that.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.936
And he said to me, he said,

08:25.038 --> 08:28.173
you're the first girl I've liked
enough to consider having a baby
with.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.209
Reel her in. Oh really?
You know?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.146
You like me enough to - out of
all these beautiful girls, you
would pick me?

08:35.816 --> 08:36.448
He chose me?

08:38.952 --> 08:40.785
He would just take me up his
arms, and we'd dance around the
game room.

08:42.756 --> 08:46.057
That was his way of being
romantic with me. I wasn't wise
enough,

08:46.159 --> 08:49.127
I wasn't worldly enough,
and my god, he was 50.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.397
He had a wife and
children, and I didn't know

08:53.267 --> 08:55.700
about the multiple girlfriends.

08:57.304 --> 08:57.969
He has rules that you're not
supposed to be with other men.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.971
I don't agree with his rules.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.744
I feel that the woman has every
right to do everything that the
man has that

09:05.846 --> 09:06.278
same right to do.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.449
But hef was brought up in an era
where girls do not fool around,
guys do.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.855
And you know, I live by that.
You're a chauvinist pig, but I
love you.

09:21.395 --> 09:25.463
Right after barbi benton, he
said I want to have, you know,

09:25.566 --> 09:25.897
more than one girlfriend.

09:27.234 --> 09:31.136
He was not gonna have a
singular girlfriend anymore,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.238
that he was going to talk about

09:34.942 --> 09:36.074
it openly.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.278
He decided as he would say that
he would come out from behind
the desk and

09:41.281 --> 09:45.083
live the playboy life
that the magazine

09:46.620 --> 09:48.587
represented. And hef was the
playboy of the western world,

09:49.990 --> 09:50.889
why should he stop at
one when he could have

09:53.393 --> 09:53.825
as many as he did?

09:56.597 --> 09:58.830
But how could he make me accept
it, or how could he make me join
it?

10:00.701 --> 10:03.468
You see our traditional value
held that the devil was in the
flesh,

10:05.839 --> 10:09.040
that the spirit and mind were
pitted against things of the
flesh.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.877
We tried to say, this conflict
does in existence and shouldn't
exist.

10:14.915 --> 10:18.016
He would tell the public even
good girls enjoy sex, healthy
sex.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.387
And there was nothing healthy
about the sex with hefner

10:23.290 --> 10:24.956
because he took it too far.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.566
He was taking the girl next
door, and he was soiling her.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.845
I was living his life, and I
wasn't living mine. I wasn't
acting anymore.

10:48.515 --> 10:53.718
He stopped me from getting
jobs, and he just got worse and

10:53.820 --> 10:57.222
worse as far as the cheating
because he could. Not only was
he messing around,

10:58.692 --> 10:59.924
he was even controlling me
when I was out of his sight.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.730
He hired somebody to spy on me.
He hired a secretary my age.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.769
I was 19 when I first started
at the mansion. We were all 19.

11:12.606 --> 11:13.972
Sondra was his girlfriend when
I first started working there,

11:16.510 --> 11:18.476
but he did have another girl
that he kind of dated on
tuesdays and thursdays.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.113
So one was going out the back
gate, and one was coming out the
front gate.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.851
I think he was probably worried
about what sondra was going to
do on tuesdays

11:26.953 --> 11:29.988
and thursdays. What was good for
the goose was not good for the
gander.

11:31.491 --> 11:35.026
She was not allowed to then date
on tuesdays and thursdays or
have a

11:35.128 --> 11:37.362
relationship of
her own on any day. [laugh]

11:40.400 --> 11:42.067
the next day, he would say,
"what'd you guys do last night?"

11:44.037 --> 11:46.671
and innocently at that stage, I
would say, "oh, we had a ball.
It was great fun."

11:47.507 --> 11:51.609
but as time sort of went on,

11:51.712 --> 11:55.413
I grew to really love sondra.
I had become a friend now,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.851
so I was no longer comfortable
reporting back if you will.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.090
It backfired on me because
lisa and I were so close,

12:06.259 --> 12:06.858
she finally told me one
night, she goes,

12:08.862 --> 12:11.830
"I was hired to spy on you and
to report everything you did
when you were

12:12.399 --> 12:14.733
away from him."

12:14.835 --> 12:16.301
and then she ended up telling
him, I can't spy anymore, and
I'm not going to do it.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.402
And he kept her on, but

12:19.172 --> 12:20.905
it was pretty creepy.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.110
He just cut me off from the
world, really.

12:29.716 --> 12:34.452
And once you were there, it was
so big and sometimes so
wonderful,

12:34.554 --> 12:38.289
yet you were afraid at times,
you didn't want to tell your
parents.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.924
There wasn't anybody
else left out there that

12:40.026 --> 12:42.293
would understand what
you're talking about.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.730
Hef's creation of playboy
was more than just getting

12:45.832 --> 12:48.600
girls to take their
clothes off and post nude.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.139
He wanted to create a
lifestyle for himself that was

12:56.042 --> 12:59.310
accepted all over the world. I
mean, that's pretty glamorous
stuff right there.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.082
He would tell me things
like, "you're making history.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.386
You're going to be in the
history books." this is at the
aliens ball, I think.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.088
He knew what to say.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.826
He would tell you that our lives
are better than most people's
fantasies.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.897
Everybody loves each other.
We shouldn't be suppressed.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.399
Suppressed is the
big word with him.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.471
I was raised in a very typically
protestant puritan home with a
lot of

13:26.573 --> 13:28.573
repression.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.675
And I think that starting the
magazine and the content of the
magazine are a

13:30.777 --> 13:31.509
reflection to that.

13:32.712 --> 13:37.148
And I think that the changes
that we've played some part in,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.784
in the changing of society, they
have also taken place inside of
me.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.422
Whenever things would
get a little rocky,

13:45.492 --> 13:48.626
he had a way about him to
make you feel like you're

13:48.728 --> 13:50.261
the only one in the
world for him.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.967
I was his public girlfriend,
and the others were just

13:57.470 --> 14:00.438
play toys.
He had no real interest in them.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.142
Once that playtime was
over - it was addicting.

14:05.812 --> 14:06.911
You knew you were special
to be a lady at the mansion;

14:10.217 --> 14:14.519
that was his romantic way, but
really, he wasn't very romantic
at all.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.158
He just created this illusion
like smoke and mirrors.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.029
Month after month after month,
there was a new girl every month
that came in.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.700
So, I figured out, I might as
well be friends with them.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.071
He would say things ,when are
you going to party with us?

14:33.173 --> 14:35.206
And I say, "never. Forget it.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.308
It's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen."

14:40.780 --> 14:43.815
it was really awkward for me
because I wasn't a lesbian.

14:46.253 --> 14:50.722
Finally one day I just, oh
geez, okay. I'll try it once,

14:50.824 --> 14:53.925
and then if I don't like it,
never ask me again." but he had
it all arranged.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.594
He took me to the window,
opened the curtain.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.965
He says, you see that blonde out
there? Go talk to her,

15:02.269 --> 15:04.002
go talk to her, and see
if she wants to party.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.209
So I went down there and asked
if she was thrilled, thrilled to
be invited up.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.378
And that's how it started.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.386
Yeah. Yeah. One of the first.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.591
I'd never used that word

15:29.963 --> 15:34.899
because I would never do that.
That sounds naughty, that sounds
nasty.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.671
I was told it was a party.
It was

15:41.975 --> 15:43.241
getting together
to have some fun.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.547
That was why I became like, I
really wasn't doing it, maybe, I
don't...

15:51.518 --> 15:52.583
I don't know, but there's
certain words I can't say.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.522
Sondra had to recruit young,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.592
fresh meat for
orgies for hefner.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.030
And I was told about that from
another bunny that was there
that was asked to go

16:06.132 --> 16:08.866
up there, and she did.

16:08.969 --> 16:12.303
And she said, you cannot believe
what went on in that bedroom.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.280
I was looking through my
pictures and I was thinking, my
god,

16:22.382 --> 16:24.615
nobody's going to believe my
story. Look at me. I mean, I
look happy.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.118
I'm looking at him
with loving eyes.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.456
And until I got to the pictures
of us sitting at the monopoly
table,

16:33.793 --> 16:37.095
this picture,
I'm being silly, I'm happy.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.032
And then this picture, he's
whispering in my ear, isn't he?

16:43.937 --> 16:45.837
I wonder what he's saying. And
then look at my face in that
one.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.509
I've been told to go
orchestrate an evening, and...

16:55.115 --> 16:58.549
Can you see it? It was like with
the feeling I had every day,

17:00.086 --> 17:01.452
I could believe everything was
wonderful, and I was happy, I
was in love.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.087
This is new year's, and

17:05.725 --> 17:06.958
then as the evening approached

17:10.597 --> 17:12.830
there it was,
there was the whisper,

17:12.932 --> 17:15.500
there was his wishes
that needed to be met.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.107
But sex of course for me is,
is not a physical act, you know,

17:25.812 --> 17:26.344
it's romance.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.282
Hef wasn't a romantic;
he was a king, the emperor;

17:33.253 --> 17:36.020
you were in the magazine or the
bedroom, or you went home.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.159
I didn't want a girl in the bed.
No, I didn't want to be with a
girl,

17:42.095 --> 17:43.094
but it's something
that made him happy.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.633
I was told that we wouldn't
have to be apart anymore because

17:51.204 --> 17:53.171
he would have no reason
to be apart from me.

17:56.009 --> 17:56.674
He hadn't taken it too far yet.

17:58.344 --> 18:02.413
Sondra had no idea what she was
getting into. I think that she
was groomed.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.682
Once he decided to push the
boundaries even further,

18:06.052 --> 18:06.751
there was no stopping
him at that point.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.491
Hef used cocaine. He used more
than that. He had a drawer full
of drugs.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.694
I discovered it when he started
giving me the key to that
drawer.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.598
And johnny was on coke.
John dante was his best friend.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.067
He lived at the mansion.

18:24.337 --> 18:28.039
Hef had to have
somebody on call 24/7

18:29.576 --> 18:32.944
whenever he had the whim or the
need or the time that he wanted
to play a

18:33.046 --> 18:34.712
game because he
was big on games.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.150
John originated the orgy.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.320
John dante and hugh
hefner lived together in

18:42.422 --> 18:45.089
the playboy mansion
for more than 20 years.

18:46.259 --> 18:46.991
I got you, john.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.627
What do you got?
That'll be a hundred dollars.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.396
And hefner would say, come up to
my bedroom and watch a movie.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.099
And then you'd have two tv
screens filming the sex,

18:57.103 --> 19:00.171
where you could stop it and play
it back and see yourself in the
act and so forth.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.274
Partying would be going
upstairs with us to the master,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.510
and you were bound to have sex.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.347
It was fairly soon into it that

19:09.449 --> 19:11.415
all of a sudden we were doing
the drugs and partying.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.052
The drugs fueled how many people
you could get in your bed,

19:15.155 --> 19:17.722
and then all of a sudden,
there's three of us. And three
girls became five, and

19:19.859 --> 19:20.458
got ridiculous up there.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.297
He twisted my mind so
much that... I loved him,

19:28.334 --> 19:29.167
that proved how
much I loved him.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.004
And I didn't want to
be with those people.

19:36.743 --> 19:41.445
I was convincing them that this
was all just so wonderful and

19:41.548 --> 19:43.681
everybody loved each other and
you're so lucky to be here,

19:43.783 --> 19:44.348
I'm so glad you're here.

19:46.085 --> 19:49.187
I take them up, you know,

19:49.289 --> 19:51.389
get to know one another, the
champagne and then the drugs
will be brought out.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.860
And then he would stroll
in and see us having fun.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.831
And he would say, "well, welcome
to the family. Welcome to the
family."

20:03.836 --> 20:05.870
and that made them feel, "oh
good. I'm part of it. You know,

20:07.273 --> 20:08.306
I'm accepted." who doesn't
want to be accepted?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.741
Who doesn't want
people to like them?

20:12.078 --> 20:12.777
The women at the mansion,

20:14.380 --> 20:17.048
they lived an incredible
existence except for one thing,

20:18.451 --> 20:19.283
nighttime is showtime.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.186
I felt like I was a ringmaster.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.455
I felt like I had to put
the show on every night.

20:27.293 --> 20:31.229
The group sex, it was at least
five nights a week. They had a
protocol.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.900
He liked to direct,
and he didn't segue away from

20:36.002 --> 20:37.802
it because you could
tell that irritated him.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.740
He was a man of
incredible appetites,

20:42.842 --> 20:46.277
yet he wasn't always a
participant, you know.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.214
He was a voyeur.
He liked to watch.

20:51.851 --> 20:52.883
As his valet,

20:54.354 --> 20:58.389
I was required to go to mario
o'connor every day when I came
to work

21:00.593 --> 21:02.526
and get his schedule of
sexual events in his bedroom,

21:05.164 --> 21:09.166
what girl he would be having sex
with and what costume she would
be wearing.

21:13.873 --> 21:17.575
He sat in a special chair,
a very comfortable arm chair.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.913
He would hire porn stars
to come to the mansion,

21:25.184 --> 21:28.552
to the bedroom and have sex with
these girls while he would
watch.

21:31.958 --> 21:36.227
Mr. Hefner kept all his sex
apparatus in the headboard
behind

21:36.329 --> 21:39.063
the bed, the different
dildos, ben wa balls,

21:40.199 --> 21:42.199
nipple clips, whips, straps.

21:45.038 --> 21:48.572
And one of my jobs was after
the sexual events were over,

21:50.777 --> 21:54.078
I had to put on rubber gloves
and pick up the dilos from the
floor

21:55.515 --> 21:58.049
and put them in a special
bucket. The maids would take
them downstairs,

22:00.253 --> 22:03.387
spray them with a steam cleaner
to sterilize them and then put
them in plastic

22:05.391 --> 22:07.725
bags. I would carry them back
upstairs and put them back in
the headboard.

22:10.229 --> 22:15.166
Many of the girls after one
experience of having sex with

22:15.268 --> 22:19.036
hefner or with the porn stars
that he brought up there, they
went home.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.005
Once was enough.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.844
For a little while,
he was doing his crazy stuff,

22:26.946 --> 22:29.647
I was just looking the other
way. Like on pig night,

22:32.318 --> 22:35.986
I remember finding out what was
going on, because he said,

22:37.156 --> 22:38.389
I'm going to be busy in the
early part of the evening,

22:39.792 --> 22:43.894
some people are coming over. And
then somebody told me what it
was.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.996
A butler there, he said it's pig
night. And I said, what? What?

22:49.335 --> 22:52.136
Every Thursday night,
hefner had two pimps

22:54.107 --> 22:56.741
bring up five or six
girls each and their cars.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.446
It was girls that they would
pick up on sunset strip. At that
time,

23:03.616 --> 23:07.618
sunset boulevard was a very
big prostitution place.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.886
That's where you went
to pick up somebody.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.858
It was called pig night, but we,
as butlers, were always told,

23:15.728 --> 23:19.130
do not call them pigs.
This was hefner's term for them.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.800
I don't know why he
called them pigs.

23:24.971 --> 23:25.703
Thursday night was pig night.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.206
When the guys on the mansion
list were expected to bring
women.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.978
They were ranked. There was a
hierarchy of whether you were a
ten or an eight

23:34.080 --> 23:35.513
or a six.

23:37.750 --> 23:41.118
They would come up and go
into the big dining room.

23:42.321 --> 23:45.890
And hefner's friends and
comrades and different stars,

23:45.992 --> 23:46.724
movie stars,

23:48.294 --> 23:51.896
television stars would sit
around the table with them.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.499
And as the butlers,
we would serve them dinner.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.136
They were told order
anything you want.

24:01.374 --> 24:04.308
Hefner would sit at the head of
the table. He would never eat
dinner with them.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.111
He would smoke a pipe
and observe the girls.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.315
When I found out about it,

24:11.417 --> 24:14.351
I went down to bedroom four
where I could look out where
they were all

24:15.822 --> 24:17.855
laughing and getting drinks and
making these girls feel special.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.191
One at a time,

24:21.727 --> 24:25.162
the girls were escorted into
the front bathroom where the

24:25.264 --> 24:29.099
doctor would inspect them
for anything that would

24:31.237 --> 24:32.937
be detrimental to
any of his friends.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.408
The girls that passed
mustard would have sex

24:39.779 --> 24:42.513
with the different friends of
hefner. Sometimes on pig night,

24:44.550 --> 24:45.449
he had a special
woman that came up.

24:47.220 --> 24:51.055
She was called the bleeder, and
she would use a very large
syringe

24:53.359 --> 24:55.626
and draw blood from
his different friends.

24:58.564 --> 25:01.899
And then a girl would
come and perform fellatio

25:02.401 --> 25:04.335
or give him a hand job.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.172
And that was a really big
thrill for a lot of people.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.676
And especially john belushi, for
some reason, that really turned
him on.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.446
I noticed that over time,

25:17.149 --> 25:21.252
these men sort of needed more
for that sexual like
stimulation.

25:23.256 --> 25:26.657
They needed to try things that
were more transgressive because
when you can have

25:26.759 --> 25:29.226
anyone you want and do anything,
then it becomes boring.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.097
This is the roller skating
party, when roller skating was
really big.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.635
Nothing was going to ever be
enough for him, and I realized
that.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.970
It didn't matter how many people
you brought in, how many
beautiful girls,

25:40.072 --> 25:41.906
whatever it was,

25:44.610 --> 25:47.344
it would only satisfy him for
the moment, and it would soon be
over,

25:47.446 --> 25:49.547
and then he'd have to find
something bigger, better
naughtier.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.551
He had too much.
He had too much.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.190
It dissolved into this madness.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.997
And I think the madness came
from our relationship that he
had created where for

26:07.099 --> 26:10.200
the first time, he could
openly do these things.

26:11.637 --> 26:15.906
And he found somebody that
loved him so much or was so easy

26:16.008 --> 26:17.875
to manipulate that it
worked, but

26:19.812 --> 26:20.311
it wasn't enough.

26:22.848 --> 26:27.051
Cocaine became for me my
way of blocking it all out.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.055
I could pretend I was somewhere
else or I was somebody else.

26:32.525 --> 26:35.025
It didn't hurt me as much.
It didn't hurt

26:36.829 --> 26:37.828
while I was doing
that, it didn't hurt.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.737
And then I walked
in once, and he was

26:49.108 --> 26:51.442
to with our dog. And I said,
"what are you doing?" he says,
"well,

26:51.544 --> 26:53.711
dogs have needs." and I
went, "stop that,

26:55.581 --> 26:57.114
just stop that." and I never
left them alone with the dog
again.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.151
I couldn't believe what I was
seeing. I could not believe what
I was seeing.

27:02.822 --> 27:06.023
Well, there are some things that
will not appear yet in playboy,
hmm,

27:07.927 --> 27:09.727
give an example, beastiality,
it's a sexual practice.

27:12.365 --> 27:15.099
Is that a hangup that you
won't publish beastiality?

27:18.571 --> 27:20.070
No, I don't think that's a
hangup. I think you have to
separate

27:21.307 --> 27:25.242
the kinds of sexual activity
that really are degrading.

27:28.714 --> 27:31.315
Joe piasho, the head of
security, was my boyfriend at
the time,

27:33.119 --> 27:34.818
he told me a story about linda
lovelace being brought up there.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.990
Linda lovelace,
she was the star of deep throat.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.094
This was probably the biggest
pornographic film ever, at least
at that point.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.365
Linda lovelace, she got hooked
up with this gassy individual,
chuck traynor.

27:50.336 --> 27:54.371
Linda was married to chuck
traynor who pimped her,

27:54.473 --> 27:56.807
who beat her up on a regular
basis, threatened to kill her
frequently.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.810
And when they arrived
at the playboy mansion,

28:00.680 --> 28:03.213
she was treated like
a piece of meat.

28:06.819 --> 28:10.988
Linda was obliged to take part
in an orgy with hefner's
cronies.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.024
When I saw linda lovelace,

28:15.594 --> 28:17.761
I definitely did not feel
that she was there willingly.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.067
All the guys were laughing when
linda lovelace got out of the
limousine, and she

28:23.169 --> 28:25.903
was drunk and drugged.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.040
And all of a sudden out of
nowhere, a german shepherd shows
up.

28:33.446 --> 28:36.246
They got her so messed up that
they made her give the german
shepherd oral sex.

28:38.451 --> 28:42.319
You want to talk about
depravity? This is despicable.

28:46.625 --> 28:50.027
When hef told me what that
night had been, he said, yeah,

28:50.129 --> 28:51.962
so we invited her up,
and we all watched.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.971
Who does that? Who does that?
Who'd want to see that?

29:02.908 --> 29:06.944
The linda lovelace episode
exemplifies the attitude of
playboy and

29:07.646 --> 29:08.779
hefner to women by and large.

29:10.683 --> 29:13.050
This is the dark
underbelly of playboy.

29:16.055 --> 29:19.957
It's all very well espousing
liberal causes and talking about
the joys of

29:20.059 --> 29:22.359
life,
freedom and sexual liberation,

29:25.064 --> 29:27.097
except it boils down to watch

29:29.468 --> 29:30.100
a girl have sex with an animal.

29:33.506 --> 29:34.171
Just gastly.

29:36.509 --> 29:40.778
I can't believe that I am that
girl that accepted that world.

29:44.650 --> 29:49.419
He just took my world, and he
just turned the knobs slowly so
that

29:49.522 --> 29:53.423
everything came out of focus and
the only thing I could see was
what he told me.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.931
He had to get more and more.
I've never known anybody had to
have that much sex,

30:03.035 --> 30:05.035
but then when it got uglier
and uglier with, you know,

30:05.137 --> 30:07.538
bringing men into the
bedroom, and I couldn't.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.309
No drug could have made
me escape far enough,

30:12.411 --> 30:14.111
and I didn't want
to be with another

30:14.213 --> 30:16.280
man. I certainly did not
want to be with another man.

30:18.551 --> 30:22.286
Hef became that obsessed
with it. I mean, yeah,

30:23.756 --> 30:27.024
you could see it in this face.
It didn't matter how it made me
feel.

30:29.295 --> 30:29.760
It didn't matter.

30:31.931 --> 30:36.366
And sometimes it was painful.
Men that

30:38.871 --> 30:41.538
forced themselves on you,
it doesn't feel good. It hurts.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.709
And I would tell him that,
please, don't, please.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.214
I would use those words.
He hurts me. It didn't matter.

30:56.522 --> 31:01.391
I felt so violated having a man
that I did not want to be with
forced upon me.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.495
And the feeling that made me
feel inside was just sick,

31:06.999 --> 31:08.732
the fact that my boyfriend
was okay with that.

31:12.171 --> 31:16.106
There were guys up there that
ended up in situations that they
didn't want to be in.

31:17.309 --> 31:21.778
It became apparent that they
have had more interest than

31:21.881 --> 31:24.381
I thought in john dante.
He wanted to sleep with him.

31:26.051 --> 31:29.486
When hef would make advances on
dante, I could

31:29.588 --> 31:32.256
just see dante's face just fall.
And the dread,

31:33.492 --> 31:36.627
the dread like I would feel.
And he knew he couldn't stop it.

31:41.100 --> 31:45.702
There were certain girls that I
was very close to that I would
call crying,

31:45.804 --> 31:48.005
and I would say, please come up,
please come up so I don't have
to do this.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.776
And they would, they would
come up for me. And I felt,

31:52.878 --> 31:55.879
at least I was with a friend,
and I was asking a lot of them,

31:58.918 --> 32:00.884
but they would come up, and
that helped me get through it.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.421
I found solace in them,
the women, they were gentle.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.491
I needed gentleness.
I needed love.

32:09.895 --> 32:14.331
At least I had the beauty and
the tenderness with a girl that
I couldn't

32:14.433 --> 32:17.801
get from him. I remember being
in the office, talking to mary,

32:17.903 --> 32:20.070
crying to mary saying, "I'm
so tired. I'm so tired.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.540
Why can't he just make a couple
nights normal?" and again,

32:27.313 --> 32:28.345
well, if you're not going to do
it, somebody else will.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.383
No, I could not, not feel well.
I had to be there. I had to feel
good.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.620
I had to be ready for anything.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.994
On the first day of
my job as a valet,

32:45.597 --> 32:50.300
I went upstairs to the bedroom.
I heard a lot of crying and
moaning.

32:51.570 --> 32:55.672
So I went into the
bathroom, and sondra was on

32:55.774 --> 32:58.108
the floor, crying, and there
was a lot of blood everywhere.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.346
I'd gone to the gynecologist,
and I didn't want to be on the
pill.

33:04.817 --> 33:08.085
And so my doctor said, "well, we
can put an iud in." what's an
iud?

33:09.955 --> 33:12.823
"well, you know, it's up there,
and it does the work, and it's
done.

33:12.925 --> 33:13.590
You don't have to think about
it." I think, well, that's
perfect.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.258
So he put it in me.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.161
She had bled all over the bed,

33:20.899 --> 33:21.965
and then she came into the
bathroom, and mr. Hefner,

33:23.535 --> 33:24.801
he got angry with her for
not taking care of herself.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.705
And he goes, why would you do
such a stupid thing? See, I
wasn't being fun now.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.743
She was bleeding, and she was
crying. And mr. Hefner said,

33:34.413 --> 33:35.645
I don't really want to
know your medical problems.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.817
I was just dying. It was hurting
so bad I could barely take it,
and

33:42.488 --> 33:45.422
I guess I passed out.
One other time,

33:47.359 --> 33:50.127
four years into the
relationship, I suddenly got
really, really sick.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.398
The pain was so severe I could
hardly walk, and it was my
kidneys.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.235
And it was just excruciating.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.073
I remember when sondra was
sick with a kidney infection.

34:04.476 --> 34:08.045
I do think that her illness was
in direct relationship to
partying

34:09.348 --> 34:10.647
and also sheer exhaustion.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.418
I should have been in the
hospital, but if he had sent me
to the hospital,

34:16.922 --> 34:18.221
then there might have been
questions why I was so sick.

34:19.691 --> 34:20.090
He didn't want any
of that leaked.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.831
I was tired, and it
was not just a body,

34:29.068 --> 34:31.301
it was a mind too. I felt that
it was both being stripped,

34:33.739 --> 34:37.207
used and swallowed up. It was
just, he was eating me inside
out.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.210
A kid who has a sweet tooth,
who is thrust into a candy store

34:44.283 --> 34:46.583
and discovers that he is going
to live in that candy store for
the rest of his life,

34:49.254 --> 34:52.022
starts after a little while
thinking about other things
besides candy.

34:55.160 --> 34:55.926
When you're dealing
with someone who's so

34:59.231 --> 35:02.999
self-centered and
so manipulative,

35:03.902 --> 35:05.669
and she was so young
and he was so not,

35:08.307 --> 35:09.039
he couldn't have had these
relationships with a grown ass
woman.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.975
Let's be very honest here.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.276
He could not have had these kind
of relationships with an adult.

35:14.947 --> 35:19.216
And that's why they had to keep
being young for him to be their
first.

35:23.188 --> 35:26.656
He asked me, he said, "do you
like snuff films?" I said,

35:26.758 --> 35:29.392
"what's a snuff film?" and he
said, "well, it's a porn where

35:31.763 --> 35:33.897
in the end, they kill the girl,

35:33.999 --> 35:37.667
and that's the big orgasm."
like, who would watch that?

35:41.373 --> 35:45.609
And my reaction told him very
clearly that he was not going
down that highway with me.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.512
I thought, who-

35:50.182 --> 35:51.982
how could he like this?
And how could I care for him?

35:54.219 --> 35:54.885
What kind of mind

35:57.923 --> 36:01.992
is so far gone that it takes
killing somebody to get them

36:02.094 --> 36:03.627
excited for that big release?

36:05.697 --> 36:09.466
He was opening my eyes to this
monster. I mean, really, he was
a monster.

36:24.183 --> 36:27.951
To me, that last year I was
turning 25, and my fears had

36:31.089 --> 36:35.091
started to affect me. I'd
actually shake sometimes. I
dreaded it every night.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.960
I knew that something was
going to be expected of me,

36:38.363 --> 36:39.663
but the person that
had run from the room,

36:40.632 --> 36:43.533
I think there were about
12 people up there,

36:46.171 --> 36:48.438
12 people. And that's when I
look, I couldn't find myself,

36:50.342 --> 36:51.007
who am I?

36:53.712 --> 36:56.913
With all these limbs
and arms and legs,

36:57.015 --> 36:59.349
and I'm thinking
this is so awful.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.152
And so, I walked out

37:05.290 --> 37:06.489
and went to the one place I knew
that people didn't know about,

37:10.062 --> 37:13.196
the grassy knoll on top of the
jacuzzi where you could lay up
there privately.

37:13.298 --> 37:13.897
And I just laid there
under the stars.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.470
You're thinking that he
couldn't find me up there.

37:25.177 --> 37:28.979
My life is him, and being there
with him, I was turning 25.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.882
I remember looking in the
mirror, looking in my eyes,
thinking, where are you?

37:33.986 --> 37:36.319
Where are you? I wasn't there.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.658
I really changed a
lot from 19 to 21.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.027
Everything changed about me.

37:44.796 --> 37:47.731
I go from being so
fresh and young,

37:48.867 --> 37:50.166
and then that emaciated,

37:52.070 --> 37:56.172
terrorized girl that I might
as well have been a vibrator.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.340
I might as well have been a sex
toy because that's what I was.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.547
And nobody knew
the hell I was in.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.485
And finally, I got the courage

38:11.323 --> 38:12.188
to leave.

38:14.259 --> 38:18.328
I had such great life when I
entered those gates. I was so
full of hope.

38:19.898 --> 38:20.864
I was riding a star.
And when I left,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.534
I was on a burning meteorite
to earth.

38:25.704 --> 38:26.269
I was hitting the ground hard.

38:27.806 --> 38:33.243
I wanted to be able to go and
leave that all behind and find
some

38:33.345 --> 38:37.847
normalness. I tried really hard
to make it normal. It was all
okay.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.449
I'm out of there. I survived it.
I'm married, I've got children,

38:40.085 --> 38:41.751
my life is good,

38:44.289 --> 38:48.091
but it was affecting me, and
it affected my marriage.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.460
It affected me every day.
I don't know what normal is.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.766
You know, I lived a luxury life,
yeah, but I paid dearly for it.

38:58.203 --> 39:03.006
I had so much damage done to me
that I will never know how to be
a

39:03.108 --> 39:05.909
normal person and to accept
love as a normal person.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.913
I will never believe that a man
would love me now because I'm
old,

39:11.583 --> 39:15.385
I'm older, and that's just,
nothing can convince me.

39:15.487 --> 39:18.855
Nothing can convince me that
I'm a desirable to anybody now.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.326
I'd like to think that one
day I'll meet my soulmate.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.298
I can't let go of that need, a
need to just be loved just for
yourself.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.969
You know, not for what you're
going to do for somebody. I may
never know that,

39:33.071 --> 39:34.604
but maybe in the next
life, I don't know.

39:37.209 --> 39:40.510
They zapped this young girl -
where am I? They zapped this
girl,

39:44.182 --> 39:47.550
away, she was gone. And all he
did was take and take and take
that.

39:49.287 --> 39:52.222
He zapped it right out me.
And how dare did he do that?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.492
I was the best thing
that ever walked into his life.

39:58.497 --> 40:03.566
But anyway, I'm so sorry I fell
apart, so sorry.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.140
So it wasn't all glam and pokes.
It wasn't all fun and games.

40:14.146 --> 40:15.278
I knew I wasn't.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.650
Drop back any point in time,
take anybody from any point in
time,

40:22.154 --> 40:25.855
you have one dinner. I wouldn't
be at a dinner, but I mean,

40:25.957 --> 40:28.625
there's certainly people that
you'd like to talk to one-on-one
and such and find

40:28.727 --> 40:31.027
out what it was all about. I'd
certainly like to talk to
christ,

40:31.129 --> 40:32.962
find out what that was all
about. - Would he like your act?

40:34.566 --> 40:37.467
Probably. Probably be a little
confusing to him, but I would
imagine so. Yeah.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.936
D you think he'd be confusing
to you? No, I don't think so,

40:40.038 --> 40:42.539
our values are probably
very similar. Yeah.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.207
He forgave the whores.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.411
This is the time for women to
be able to express themselves.

41:23.315 --> 41:26.249
I believed in the pitch because
I had not seen the future.

41:27.319 --> 41:28.785
I had dreams of going
up the corporate ladder.

41:30.388 --> 41:33.223
They pushed that ceiling
right back into my face.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.591
You're never going to believe
what I found in the garage.

41:36.495 --> 41:41.564
All of the complaints and the
sexual assaults, every [beep]
thing is on there.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.436
It was rampant with the
sexual abuse of women.

41:46.538 --> 41:47.637
Playboy was a business,
and I was part of it.

41:49.941 --> 41:52.375
I began hating myself.
