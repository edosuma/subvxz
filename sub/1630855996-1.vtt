What do you mean? What?

45:28.935 --> 45:31.688
I prayed for help
and God answered.

45:33.273 --> 45:34.399
-He said--
-[Gabe] That's enough.

45:41.364 --> 45:43.575
Won't you put some coffee on
to cook for us,

45:43.616 --> 45:45.076
please, my dear?

45:45.118 --> 45:47.287
Not-- not the okra.

45:47.328 --> 45:50.582
The good beans
to soothe our fallen soldier.

45:54.878 --> 45:58.256
We must be careful not to become
comfortable with this man.

45:58.298 --> 45:59.549
Do you understand?

45:59.591 --> 46:00.800
Yes, I understand.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.939
[Gabe] I am reminded
to repair this roof

46:14.981 --> 46:16.483
only when it rains.

46:17.358 --> 46:18.401
[Daniel grunting]

46:22.822 --> 46:24.782
I've recently read
an announcement

46:24.824 --> 46:29.537
which describes the suffering
soldiers, most malnutrition.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.707
[Daniel grunts]

46:32.749 --> 46:35.543
The worst of which succumb
to feeding on fallen horses.

46:37.337 --> 46:38.421
Is that true?

46:41.716 --> 46:43.301
The atrocities,

46:43.343 --> 46:45.637
policies we impose
upon ourselves,

46:45.678 --> 46:46.763
will they never end?

46:48.515 --> 46:49.933
Is it ever enough?

46:49.974 --> 46:52.519
It's as if
all of God's creations

46:52.560 --> 46:55.730
are made to suffer
and that these times are...

46:57.273 --> 46:58.358
cursed.

47:01.778 --> 47:03.571
I fear
you're in a great deal of pain.

47:03.613 --> 47:06.699
Please. Please, do you have
anything for the pain?

47:06.741 --> 47:08.576
[Daniel groaning]

47:08.618 --> 47:11.621
This is not a hospital.
This is my home.

47:11.663 --> 47:13.623
-What?
-This is my home, sir.

47:13.665 --> 47:15.583
I need-- I need to--
I need a hospital.

47:15.625 --> 47:17.460
-You need-- you need to move me.
-There is no hospital for miles.

47:17.502 --> 47:19.045
-Come on.
-You need move me!

47:19.087 --> 47:20.463
[crying] You need to move me.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.215
[Elsie] What is happening?

47:22.257 --> 47:24.175
He's having spasms.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.719
Please, dear,
fetch a cold compress.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.096
Please, please.

47:28.137 --> 47:30.014
Go! Get them quickly.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.892
-Relax, relax. Breathe.
-[gasping]

47:33.893 --> 47:35.603
The mend will burst.

47:35.645 --> 47:36.813
You cannot move like this.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.231
You're doing yourself no favors.

47:38.273 --> 47:40.233
I can't stay. I can't stay.

47:40.275 --> 47:44.028
I can't stay.
I can't stay. Stay. Stay.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.030
[Daniel wheezing]

47:46.072 --> 47:47.532
Please, sir, breathe.

47:48.366 --> 47:49.450
That's it, son.

47:50.118 --> 47:52.036
-Relax.
-[breathing heavily]

47:52.078 --> 47:55.290
Breathe and breathe.

48:02.171 --> 48:03.464
God gives you peace.

48:05.174 --> 48:07.218
[fire crackling]

48:24.444 --> 48:26.779
[Daniel coughing]

48:37.540 --> 48:38.625
How long?

48:39.959 --> 48:41.461
How long have I been asleep?

48:42.503 --> 48:43.588
Two days.

48:44.547 --> 48:45.882
I can't feel my feet.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.008
What did you give me?

48:48.051 --> 48:49.677
A home remedy therapeutic.

48:51.763 --> 48:53.139
The last of it, I'm afraid.

48:54.641 --> 48:55.767
I need to send word...

48:57.018 --> 48:58.102
to my regiment.

49:00.021 --> 49:01.773
I have details I need to relay.

49:04.067 --> 49:06.069
The Confederates

49:06.110 --> 49:07.862
are moving towards Chambersburg.

49:09.447 --> 49:11.074
And-- [groans]

49:11.115 --> 49:14.202
I beseech you, sir,
abandon such thoughts.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.581
You should know
right off the start that...

49:19.749 --> 49:23.211
this house does not condone

49:23.252 --> 49:25.046
the war efforts of either party.

49:26.798 --> 49:29.467
While we do have
an opinion on such,

49:29.509 --> 49:31.803
wholeheartedly,
we are against violence.

49:33.638 --> 49:34.889
That's good.

49:34.931 --> 49:36.099
Me too.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.433
We are a home of worship...

49:38.601 --> 49:40.937
and of harmony,

49:40.978 --> 49:42.105
or at least...

49:43.314 --> 49:44.524
that we try.

49:45.483 --> 49:48.111
And as with any
harmonious relationship,

49:48.152 --> 49:50.780
it requires certain conditions

49:50.822 --> 49:54.951
and efforts from everybody

49:54.992 --> 49:58.621
of which I have two of you.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.290
The first, do not spit

50:01.332 --> 50:02.834
on the good Lord's name.

50:04.168 --> 50:07.088
I have heard terse words
from your mouth already.

50:08.923 --> 50:11.634
It will not be tolerated.
Please refrain.

50:11.676 --> 50:12.760
The second...

50:13.803 --> 50:15.054
no names.

50:15.096 --> 50:16.597
We are not meant to be friends.

50:17.557 --> 50:19.726
Do not mistake our hospitality

50:19.767 --> 50:23.229
for anything more
than respect of life and of...

50:24.939 --> 50:26.023
God.

50:27.984 --> 50:31.571
So you have our promise
and our fervent prayers

50:31.612 --> 50:34.949
that we'll put forth
all efforts in your mending.

50:34.991 --> 50:36.075
And when you are able...

50:37.702 --> 50:40.413
you'll be able to walk
away from here.

50:41.372 --> 50:42.457
And that is all.

50:43.416 --> 50:45.376
That is all
that is requested of you.

50:47.003 --> 50:50.631
Please, I need to send word
to my regiment.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.759
-No!
-[groaning]

50:52.800 --> 50:54.135
You do not!

50:56.763 --> 50:58.347
There will be

50:58.389 --> 51:00.516
no regiment on this land.

51:00.558 --> 51:01.851
Make no mistake.

51:01.893 --> 51:04.896
Not one soldier will step foot

51:04.937 --> 51:06.230
on this property,

51:06.272 --> 51:08.941
nor know its whereabouts.

51:11.527 --> 51:14.697
How you ended up here
still mystifies me.

51:16.491 --> 51:18.409
But as you are here...

51:20.286 --> 51:22.914
your back was fairly torn open
by the bullet.

51:25.124 --> 51:26.501
But we found nothing foreign.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.378
You're of good fortune
that it...

51:30.880 --> 51:32.673
seems to have just grazed you,

51:32.715 --> 51:34.383
missed your spine entirely.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.929
It would seem that

51:37.970 --> 51:40.556
luck has smiled
favorably upon you.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.184
[Daniel groaning] Yeah.

51:43.810 --> 51:45.019
I feel very lucky.

51:48.147 --> 51:51.484
Now, if you could send word

51:51.526 --> 51:52.693
to Chambersburg.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.280
[Gabe]
Chambersburg is not near here.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.325
At least call for a doctor.

52:00.576 --> 52:03.287
Doctors and priests
are few and far between.

52:03.996 --> 52:08.000
As I've said,
it is just us and us alone.

52:11.087 --> 52:12.380
[cork squeaking]

52:14.507 --> 52:15.591
[Daniel] What is that?

52:16.634 --> 52:19.011
[Gabe] When the war broke out,
I had the foresight

52:19.053 --> 52:21.764
to get some
general provisions of service.

52:21.806 --> 52:24.475
Breathe easy on that
for comfort.

52:24.517 --> 52:26.561
-[Daniel breathes deeply]
-[Gabe] Easy.

52:26.602 --> 52:28.980
-[Daniel exhales]
-That's it.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.232
Let us leave him.

52:37.864 --> 52:39.574
Are you a religious man?

52:41.409 --> 52:42.577
I have my moments.

52:43.244 --> 52:45.830
Take comfort in knowing
that we will be your Bible.

52:52.670 --> 52:53.963
If death is to come to you...

52:56.132 --> 52:57.216
let her be swift.

53:22.783 --> 53:26.245
[raspy breathing]

53:26.287 --> 53:28.205
[wind whistling through trees]

53:34.295 --> 53:36.339
[door creaks open]

53:40.843 --> 53:43.512
[footsteps approaching]

53:51.729 --> 53:54.732
[raspy breathing]

53:55.983 --> 53:57.777
[bed squeaking]

54:00.655 --> 54:02.490
-[bed squeaking]
-[Daniel] Leave me, witch!

54:04.158 --> 54:07.620
[groaning]

54:14.502 --> 54:17.296
-[creaking]
-[Daniel groaning]

54:25.972 --> 54:28.599
[Daniel panting]

54:33.354 --> 54:36.440
[creaking]

54:44.115 --> 54:45.199
[groans]

54:48.536 --> 54:50.955
[Gabe] This is madness!
Foolish thing!

54:50.997 --> 54:52.915
You will not go in there!
I won't have it!

54:52.957 --> 54:54.583
[Elsie] You need to believe.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.377
Things are different now,
[indistinct].

54:56.419 --> 54:59.005
-[Daniel groans]
-[indistinct arguing]

54:59.046 --> 55:01.882
-[Elsie] I can feel it.
-And what of it? Huh?

55:01.924 --> 55:04.677
[indistinct] ...a precious
[indistinct]

55:04.719 --> 55:07.638
[indistinct],
things are at peace right now,

55:08.472 --> 55:11.058
The Union Army
may be looking for him.

55:12.018 --> 55:14.895
Bold of you to believe
to even have one soldier,

55:14.937 --> 55:17.523
let alone the entire army here.
I won't have it!

55:17.565 --> 55:19.483
Is that all
you're worried about?

55:19.525 --> 55:21.277
Keeping the army out of here,
huh?

55:22.528 --> 55:25.614
You know the Proctor name is not
in high standard right now.

55:26.782 --> 55:27.867
Listen to me.

55:28.743 --> 55:29.910
Listen to me.

55:30.745 --> 55:33.706
[sobbing] We need help.

55:34.749 --> 55:37.209
We need help.
We cannot do anything more.

55:38.836 --> 55:39.920
Shh.

55:41.756 --> 55:44.091
[Daniel groaning]

55:48.429 --> 55:49.930
[bell ringing]

55:49.972 --> 55:51.057
Bell.

56:03.986 --> 56:05.529
I see you found the bell.

56:08.324 --> 56:10.159
I, uh,

56:10.201 --> 56:11.577
I need to use a lavatory.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.622
[groaning]

56:14.663 --> 56:16.040
And I think
you have squirrels in here.

56:20.169 --> 56:21.253
[Daniel groaning]

56:24.757 --> 56:28.260
[Daniel panting, groaning]

56:34.141 --> 56:35.226
Done.

56:43.776 --> 56:44.860
What is it?

56:46.737 --> 56:47.822
Nothing.

56:52.451 --> 56:53.744
[Daniel]
I won't survive like this.

56:54.662 --> 56:55.788
I just can't.

56:56.747 --> 56:57.873
It's too much to bear.

56:59.500 --> 57:02.336
I'm afraid
this is the best we can offer.

57:03.587 --> 57:05.631
[Daniel] A doctor then?
Can you send for a doctor?

57:06.257 --> 57:07.424
Animal doctor, anyone?

57:08.759 --> 57:10.511
First light,

57:10.553 --> 57:12.012
after the hunt,

57:12.054 --> 57:13.139
I'll fetch one.

57:14.557 --> 57:15.683
[Elsie] Get some sleep.

57:23.566 --> 57:24.650
Heaven help us.

57:28.737 --> 57:29.822
[Daniel] The old lady.

57:32.992 --> 57:34.076
Tell the old woman...

57:35.244 --> 57:36.412
to leave me alone.

57:40.374 --> 57:42.293
Bury me

57:42.334 --> 57:45.296
near the dogwood tree, please.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.674
May God look after you.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.972
[footsteps retreating]

57:55.014 --> 57:57.183
[Daniel]
I felt my body shutting down.

57:57.224 --> 57:58.434
I knew I was dying.

57:59.476 --> 58:00.811
[Heysinger]
"So did the Proctors.

58:01.854 --> 58:03.397
[Heysinger and Daniel]
I was going to be buried

58:03.439 --> 58:04.815
in that yard someplace."

58:05.441 --> 58:08.360
[Daniel] As Jesus suffered
on the planks of the dogwood...

58:08.402 --> 58:10.738
[Heysinger] "Hopefully,

58:10.779 --> 58:13.449
-near the dogwood I spawn."
-...I must be buried there.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.701
[Clayton] Boy,
that's some story.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.329
Snake oil salesman here, folks.

58:19.121 --> 58:21.832
I'd like to know
how you survived all these years

58:21.874 --> 58:25.252
after you were stabbed
and shot in the back

58:25.294 --> 58:26.462
without medical care...

58:27.963 --> 58:29.048
urinating blood.

58:29.632 --> 58:31.800
What are you?
A miracle or something?

58:32.593 --> 58:35.304
Crafty storyteller
is more in line.

58:35.346 --> 58:37.264
[Clayton chuckles]
Any thoughts out here?

58:39.141 --> 58:42.686
Sister, is this man a miracle?

58:43.604 --> 58:46.065
There are many forces
at work here.

58:47.107 --> 58:48.192
Most certainly...

58:49.735 --> 58:51.028
a divine miracle.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.365
Well, I'm simply not qualified

58:54.406 --> 58:56.200
to bestow
that label on anything.

58:56.242 --> 58:57.701
[Clayton] Hmm. [laughing]

58:57.743 --> 59:00.079
Lazy answer, Sister. Lazy.

59:00.788 --> 59:03.582
Who is then?
Who is qualified? Who?

59:04.833 --> 59:06.210
Huh?

59:06.252 --> 59:08.254
-A priest.
-I'm not buying it.

59:08.295 --> 59:09.380
I'm not buying it.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.840
I am not buying it, Glassman.

59:11.882 --> 59:12.967
None of it.

59:13.842 --> 59:15.177
Too fantastic.

59:15.219 --> 59:16.303
What's the point of all this?

59:17.680 --> 59:19.265
Surely you're not suggesting

59:19.306 --> 59:21.433
Mr. Glassman has fabricated
all of this?

59:22.101 --> 59:23.477
To what end?

59:24.019 --> 59:25.521
[Clayton] Exactly
the right question, Doctor.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.940
To what end?

59:29.233 --> 59:31.026
He wants to clear
his conscience.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.070
[Clayton] I don't think so. No.

59:36.865 --> 59:40.035
Why do you have your filthy
little fingernails in me, huh?

59:40.494 --> 59:42.246
That isn't a confession, is it?

59:42.288 --> 59:43.497
No.

59:43.539 --> 59:44.665
You're a clever man, Glassman.

59:44.707 --> 59:45.791
But guess what?

59:46.417 --> 59:47.501
So am I.

59:48.627 --> 59:49.712
So am I.

59:50.462 --> 59:52.631
I wanna talk to the person

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.732
One more week.

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:51.367
[breathing heavily]

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:54.704
Shit.

01:12:54.746 --> 01:12:57.916
[breathing raggedly]

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:12.263
[crying]

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.558
[shouting]

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.894
[bed legs scraping floor]

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.687
[Daniel grunting]

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:24.025
[Daniel groaning]

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.490
This got ripped open bad
last night.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.284
What were you doing?

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.622
Just wanted to feel my feet
on the floor.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.752
To be honest, I thought
I was gone for it then.

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:46.714
So it's a step forward,
wouldn't you say?

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:49.926
No.

01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:52.929
You tore open
weeks' worth of healing.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.015
How is that a step forward?

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:57.559
I think so.

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:02.230
I'm just...

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.983
happy.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.069
How long have you lived here?

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:13.158
I'm not supposed to have
personal conversations with you.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.576
Please.

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.912
I need something
to occupy in my mind, just talk.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:22.876
All right.

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.128
All my life.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.338
I grew up here.

01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:30.884
This is my parents' home.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:32.886
That's nice.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.723
I briefly moved away
with my husband,

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:39.559
but when my father died,

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:41.936
we moved back.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:43.938
I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.942
I'm-- I'm not supposed to have
personal conversations with you.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:52.071
I'm sorry.
I-- I just-- I cannot.

01:14:53.198 --> 01:14:55.366
[groaning] It's okay, Elsie.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.288
How do you know my name?

01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:03.082
It's okay.

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:05.752
I know all your names.

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.171
I hope that doesn't bother you.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.425
I guess not.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.263
-Does Gabe know?
-No.

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:20.725
I don't want this to be trouble.

01:15:21.935 --> 01:15:23.811
I won't-- I won't bring it out.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:26.856
It's our secret.

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:31.778
[sighs] I hate secrets.

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.863
Nothing good comes from them.

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:37.075
Me too.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.870
Sometimes they're necessary,
aren't they?

01:15:43.248 --> 01:15:44.707
How did you find out?

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:47.085
I'm terribly clever.

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:52.298
Listen, I just-- I just
wanna mend up and be on my way.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.134
Who's Bishop Talbot?

01:15:57.804 --> 01:15:59.514
I don't know him. Why?

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:03.643
I keep hearing his name
whispered in my head.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:09.482
Don't know him.
Means-- means nothing.

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:17.740
I keep hearing

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.075
sobbing...

01:16:19.951 --> 01:16:21.703
coming somewhere from outside,
I think.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.999
What's going on here?

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:27.917
Sounds like a child.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.881
[voice breaking] It's my--
it's my daughter.

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:37.844
She's sick.

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:41.014
-Very sick.
-What ails her?

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.560
[sobbing] We're--
we're at a complete loss.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.145
I-- a doctor...

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:50.440
came out here a long time ago,

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:52.608
and he said that...

01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:57.530
there's something wrong
with her mind.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.533
That there's nothing to do

01:17:00.575 --> 01:17:03.619
but to keep her comfortable or--

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:06.122
or committed to a hospital.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:09.876
I don't want
to place blame but...

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.797
[sobbing] ...it hurts
to have thoughts like this.

01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:19.010
But I can't think
of any other answer.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:24.974
When we moved back home,
my-- my mother fell ill, and--

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:30.063
And when my daughter was born,

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:31.522
she got worse, and...

01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:39.447
And one day my mother took
a walk through the woods...

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:44.619
to get a kindling, and I was
so busy tending to my baby,

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.539
I didn't realize just
how much time had passed.

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:51.584
And when she finally came home,

01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:52.919
she was...

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.589
she wasn't herself.

01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.092
Uh, from there she got worse.

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:01.969
She was just...

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.598
foul to all of us.

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:11.145
Foul words,
foul acts, even a foul smell.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:13.481
And...

01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:16.234
And Gabe and I didn't...

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:19.445
we didn't know it at the time,

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:24.158
but she must have been too sick
to be around a young child.

01:18:25.243 --> 01:18:27.412
On her third birthday...

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:32.625
my daughter started
getting sick as well.

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.337
[sobbing]

01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:40.258
Well, Gabe says they have--

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.052
they have good days.

01:18:45.263 --> 01:18:48.850
Days they seem like themselves.

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:51.310
That should give comfort.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.772
No, I'm sorry.

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:57.191
Those are--
those are the worst days.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.693
They're the hardest because...

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:03.322
that's when
they become aware enough...

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:08.578
that they are in pain
and misery and hell.

01:19:10.538 --> 01:19:13.875
And they never have
good days at the same time.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:19.046
My-- my daughter
will be good, and then my--

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:23.092
my mother will be sick
and so on, back and forth.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.430
The doctor...

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.391
that examined your daughter,

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:32.226
can you get him here?

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.561
He's dead.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.525
I see it now.

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:41.903
I mean,
your arrival was by chance.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.491
I have to accept that...

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:49.827
you're stuck here
with the rest of us.

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:52.288
If the crying is bothering you,

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:57.001
I can ask Gabe
to board up the windows

01:19:57.043 --> 01:19:58.377
or...

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:02.131
or move your bed
across the room.

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:03.758
That elderly woman
I keep seeing...

01:20:05.635 --> 01:20:07.053
that's your mother?

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.680
I beg your pardon?

01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:12.350
The elderly woman
that comes in here.

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:13.768
Who is she?

01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:16.521
I don't find this funny,
soldier.

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:21.859
There is no way you can be
talking about my mother.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:23.986
There's someone
that comes into my room.

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:26.489
Please stop it, sir!

01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:28.074
This is not funny.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:30.034
I find it rather hurtful.

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:32.495
Hurtful? In what way?

01:20:33.246 --> 01:20:35.122
My mother is a cripple.

01:20:35.957 --> 01:20:38.793
She hasn't walked
since she got sick.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:42.672
So you see,
there is no way in hell--

01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:45.174
There is-- is no way

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:49.136
she was in this room because
she hasn't walked in 13 years.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.097
Then it--
it must be someone else.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.682
Is-- is there
anyone else in the house?

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:55.643
I shouldn't be talking to you.

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:58.271
Listen, Elsie, I--

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:01.524
Stop using my name.

01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:09.949
For Christ--

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:16.914
Hold on, hold on.

01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:18.874
Everyone's buying this?

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:22.837
Witches and curses? Come on now.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.589
This is how it starts.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.717
Look, these are
the delusional anecdotes

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:30.094
of a twisted
and fragmented mind.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:33.347
We can't trust
anything on those...

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.766
[coughing] ...on those pages.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.853
All right?
Let's get to the point, okay?

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.022
[coughing]

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:43.232
Just get to the point,
just cut to it.

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:48.070
How do you know me, huh?

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:50.781
[clears throat]
And what do you really want?

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:54.869
What do you-- [coughing]

01:21:55.745 --> 01:21:57.038
You all right, Detective?

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:58.706
I-- I need some-- [coughing]

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:00.583
I-- I just need
some air or something.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.585
[coughing] Time-out, excuse me.

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:04.712
[Heysinger] We're--
we're almost finished.

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:06.339
Detective,
we're almost finished.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.341
-[Clayton coughing]
-We're almost finished!

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.426
Where are you going?

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:13.387
[violently coughing]

01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:20.227
[wheezing laughter]

01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:24.148
[Heysinger] Detective,
I need to tell you something.

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:25.858
I need some air.

01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:29.904
[violently coughing]

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:34.075
[suspenseful music playing]

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:37.244
[gasping, groaning]

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.621
Oh, this is--

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.920
[sighing] Son of a bitch.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.020
[suspenseful music playing]

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.369
Shit.

01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:18.304
She took 'em.

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.306
Son of a...

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:40.993
Goddamn nonsense.
Who types like this?

01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:50.878
There it is.

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:55.943
What in God's name
are you up to, Heysinger?

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:02.074
Oh, come on, give it up.

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.340
[clicking]

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:55.396
-Lock that door right now.
-What?

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:56.981
Lock this door right now.

01:27:57.022 --> 01:27:58.399
Just lock it.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.488
[lock clicking]

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:07.950
Okay, look, um, I wanna
see his old room upstairs.

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.411
All right, go.

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:18.836
-[keys clanking]
-[lock turning]

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:33.350
[Rose] Oh, Lord.

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:38.439
We've had this room cleaned
a dozen times, maybe more.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.026
It kept coming back
so we've sealed it off.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.360
[Clayton] Mm-hmm.

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:46.447
Now the entire hospital's
on track for ruin.

01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:49.533
Shine it under here.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.332
What is that?

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:01.128
Doctor, has anyone else
ever stayed in this room?

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.880
No.

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:05.716
We don't even use it for--
for storage, obviously.

01:29:06.967 --> 01:29:09.845
If there is anything
you are withholding from me

01:29:09.887 --> 01:29:12.347
about this man,
now is the time to fess up.

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:14.767
I told you everything I know

01:29:14.808 --> 01:29:16.977
from my professional
perspective.

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.063
Okay, from your nonprofessional
perspective, how about that?

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:20.522
That perspective doesn't hold

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:24.234
under the weight
of logic or science.

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.361
Well, at this point,
if you told me this Glassman

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.614
was the goddamn Easter bunny,

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:30.866
I'd be willing to listen.

01:29:32.993 --> 01:29:36.538
Nothing what I'm about to say
will make much sense.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.915
Try me.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.086
He wasn't transferred
from Pittsburgh.

01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:45.130
-He was banished.
-Hmm.

01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:47.674
It seems to anyone who spends
a significant amount of time

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:50.636
next to him falls ill and dies.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.013
What?

01:29:55.516 --> 01:29:58.352
Pittsburgh didn't want him
for fear he was contaminated.

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:02.106
I took him in because--

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:03.732
well, because.

01:30:03.774 --> 01:30:05.567
Contaminated with what?

01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:08.112
[Rose] The devil.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:12.783
Okay, um, did he ever have
any visitors?

01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:15.327
-You're joking.
-No.

01:30:15.369 --> 01:30:18.205
Who was the nurse that typed up
the confession again?

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:22.501
Nurse Barbara Ackerman.

01:30:22.543 --> 01:30:24.628
I thought you said,
um, Betty Ackerman.

01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:25.963
Right. Betty.

01:30:26.004 --> 01:30:27.965
Yes, but who is that?

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:29.466
I've never heard of her.

01:30:30.134 --> 01:30:31.802
Long before you started here.

01:30:33.137 --> 01:30:35.973
You said the confession
was just completed.

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.016
I should've
at least heard of her then.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.477
I never said the confession
was just completed.

01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:43.438
How long was she exposed to him?

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.190
Longer than I have?

01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:47.359
Much longer, I'm sure of it.

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:49.778
I monitored your time.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:52.072
You're safe.

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:54.575
How do you know that?

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:56.827
How can you measure any of this?

01:31:03.834 --> 01:31:05.627
You asked me what I'm hiding.

01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:09.548
The truth is,
I'm completely terrified of him.

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:11.133
And I want him out of my life.

01:31:11.175 --> 01:31:12.509
I want him dead.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:15.179
And I'm thoroughly
ashamed of it.

01:31:15.888 --> 01:31:17.764
So, he is cursed.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.393
He is the curse.

01:31:21.435 --> 01:31:22.728
[Rose] We need a priest.

01:31:23.437 --> 01:31:25.105
I keep hearing that. Why?

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:29.026
It's not from here.

01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:33.447
And you must understand
that I'm not in a position

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.490
to directly help
Daniel in ritual.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.493
I-- I can't even listen
to his confession.

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.204
Only a priest can do that.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.373
I only joined the sisterhood
to become a nurse

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:45.250
so I understand skepticism.

01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:47.169
But if I can make
just one point,

01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:49.379
it's that we need
a Catholic priest.

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:52.883
Honestly...

01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:55.469
do you actually believe...

01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:57.930
in the devil?

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.390
You bet I do.

01:32:01.725 --> 01:32:02.976
Well, nobody's getting in
or out

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.436
till they bring us bulldozers.

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:06.104
Let's finish this.

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:07.439
I don't feel
anything will change

01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:08.774
when we get to the final page.

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:10.776
There'll be no
heavenly beam of bullshit,

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.319
no miraculous miracle.

01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:13.946
I'm framing this whole deal...

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:16.949
in two different ways.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:20.535
First, Betty Ackerman
was delusional in her own way

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:23.538
and gave the trickster
my name, my daughter's name...

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:25.707
and my history.

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:29.044
Then carved my name
into his torso.

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:31.463
That's right, Doctor.
I saw the photographs.

01:32:32.506 --> 01:32:34.007
What's the other way?

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:35.550
The other way?

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:36.969
Is that our good doctor here...

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.763
is part of the whole party
since the beginning.

01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:45.018
[Daniel guttural screaming]

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.561
Oh, good God, what was that?

01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.772
Let's go, come on, let's go.

01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:50.774
[ominous music playing]

01:32:50.816 --> 01:32:54.152
[Daniel roaring, shrieking]

01:32:57.447 --> 01:33:00.075
[Daniel roaring]

01:33:13.714 --> 01:33:15.007
Here we go.

01:33:15.882 --> 01:33:18.802
"I was trying to believe
this was a family of witches,

01:33:18.844 --> 01:33:20.679
devil worshipers,"
blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:22.472
"...mental condition"--
no kidding,

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:24.349
"deteriorated faster
than my physical condition.

01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:26.143
Distrust is all I felt
for these people."

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:27.769
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:29.688
Oh, brother.

01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:32.441
Oh, there's more of these
strange capitalized letters.

01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:36.653
D-E, D-E-N-D
on these first few pages.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:38.780
Can you keep track of these
for me, sister?

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:41.033
There's some more.
I'm expecting more.

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:43.076
Okay.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.916
Wait.

01:33:51.752 --> 01:33:53.670
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.929
[Gabe] I don't know!
What you want me to do?

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.973
I'm doing everything I can.

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:08.810
Leave my daughter alone.

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:11.188
Who are you to do this to us?

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.441
What have we done to you?

01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:20.238
-[Elsie sobbing]
-Elsie, I'm sorry.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.908
I don't know what to do.
She's cutting herself.

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:25.869
Looking at me in the eye
and cutting herself blatantly.

01:34:25.911 --> 01:34:27.621
I can't stop her.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.956
[Elsie] No, let me go see her.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.709
[Gabe] No, you can't see
her like this, you can't, Elsie.

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:34.961
It's not even her.
It's not Gail anymore.

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:38.507
I don't know what's happening,
and I don't know what to do!

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:41.301
[Elsie sobbing]
I don't-- I don't-- No!

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:42.636
-What's happening?
-[strange creaking]

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:46.306
What's happening, is she hurt?

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:48.225
-[Gabe] Yes, she is.
-[Daniel gasps]

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.939
[Danial screaming]

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:58.652
[witch, indistinct]

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:01.655
You're from nowhere, boy.

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:03.907
You'll see
when you're [indistinct].

01:35:05.492 --> 01:35:08.328
[indistinct]

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:10.705
We're not finished.

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:14.251
[laughs, speaking indistinctly]

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:16.586
[indistinct]

01:35:19.256 --> 01:35:22.384
[Daniel groaning]

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:25.178
[distant screaming]

01:35:30.559 --> 01:35:34.146
-Stand back, what are you doing?
-No, no, no, no!

01:35:34.187 --> 01:35:36.481
[Elsie sobbing] Let me see her,
let me see her!

01:35:36.523 --> 01:35:38.733
You can't, you can't,
listen to me!

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:40.944
There's nothing to help her.
There's nothing I can do.

01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:43.697
-[Elsie] Let me go see her.
Please, let me see her.

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:45.907
[Gabe] I'm so sorry. I don't
know what happened to her.

01:35:45.949 --> 01:35:47.701
Let me go see her.

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:50.078
Go get the sheets.
I need the sheets.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.747
[Elsie sobbing] Gail,
Gail, I'm here, Gail!

01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:54.583
-I want the sheets!
-Gail!

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:56.626
[Gabe] Get my Bible, quickly!

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:58.211
Get my Bible.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:35:59.588
No, you can't.

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:02.007
You can't, she-- she's done.

01:36:02.048 --> 01:36:03.717
That's not your little girl.

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.260
Go, go quickly.

01:36:05.302 --> 01:36:06.636
[Elsie] Okay.

01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:09.306
[Gabe] Elsie, quickly!

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:11.892
[Elsie] I got the sheet.
How is she doing?

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:13.852
-[strange creaking]
-How's my baby?

01:36:13.894 --> 01:36:15.520
[screaming]

01:36:15.562 --> 01:36:17.772
[panting]

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:19.566
[screaming]

01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:26.198
[Elsie sobbing in distance]

01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:27.699
[Gabe] Listen to me!

01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:29.868
[house rattling]

01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:33.371
[objects clattering]

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:36.041
[glass breaking]

01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:53.934
[male voice shouting]

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:28.426
[Daniel] What in God's name
is happening here?

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:32.556
You should be sleeping, soldier.

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:35.684
I should say the same to you.

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:37.978
Fair enough.

01:37:39.396 --> 01:37:41.940
I can't imagine how anyone
gets sleep in this...

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:43.858
dreadful place.

01:37:45.151 --> 01:37:47.112
There's something
terribly perverse here.

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:52.367
Your daughter.

01:37:53.827 --> 01:37:57.038
What ungodly sickness
has she contracted?

01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:00.083
My heart...

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:02.419
breaks for her.

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:04.546
She seems...

01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:06.965
lost.

01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:08.675
We're all lost here.

01:38:10.427 --> 01:38:12.887
I can't imagine how you keep
your own daughter...

01:38:14.055 --> 01:38:15.390
locked in that place.

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:17.642
Not by my hand.

01:38:19.477 --> 01:38:20.979
I don't understand.

01:38:22.105 --> 01:38:24.357
She's a prisoner
of an evil entity.

01:38:26.693 --> 01:38:28.069
What do you mean?

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:30.113
First I thought
it was atonement.

01:38:32.449 --> 01:38:35.285
God has the most excellent
sleight of hand.

01:38:35.327 --> 01:38:36.953
At least,
that's what we're taught.

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:40.540
And now?

01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:43.710
And now there is no God
anywhere near this house.

01:38:45.045 --> 01:38:47.297
You see,
this is our punishment...

01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:52.052
of the rawest form.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.221
What on earth for?

01:38:57.432 --> 01:39:00.268
I suppose
we won't know that until the end

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:02.354
when we make confession.

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:05.357
And as confessions go,

01:39:05.398 --> 01:39:07.734
I must confess
the truth to you, soldier.

01:39:12.614 --> 01:39:14.574
You'll never leave this place.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:19.412
You are never
going to leave this place.

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:25.418
To hell with this place.

01:39:27.212 --> 01:39:28.630
Hmm.

01:39:28.672 --> 01:39:31.925
Your name is Gabe Proctor.

01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:37.555
Your wife's name is Elsie.

01:39:37.597 --> 01:39:39.057
Silence!

01:39:39.099 --> 01:39:41.017
-Your daughter's name is Gail.
-Quiet!

01:39:41.059 --> 01:39:42.352
-My name--
-Silence!

01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:43.853
...is Daniel Glassman!

01:39:46.398 --> 01:39:48.817
-Glassman.
-Yes sir.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.278
-Daniel Glassman.
-See, you know me.

01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:55.490
You know me now.
I'm not just some burden.

01:39:56.866 --> 01:39:58.368
You know who I am.

01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:01.371
Please don't give up on me.

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:04.124
Please.

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:08.086
Just put me on your carriage
and get me the hell outta here.

01:40:08.128 --> 01:40:10.839
I'll take my chances on the side
of the road if I must.

01:40:16.261 --> 01:40:19.347
Our daughter murdered
our priest in this very room.

01:40:20.598 --> 01:40:22.726
-Murder?
-Aye.

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:28.898
At last, now I have
your attention, don't I?

01:40:29.816 --> 01:40:31.943
I vowed never
to speak this story, but--

01:40:33.236 --> 01:40:34.654
but I see it fit now.

01:40:35.864 --> 01:40:40.702
I had invited
Father Spinozi over

01:40:40.744 --> 01:40:43.371
to do a simple blessing
of our home.

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:47.417
No mention was
given of the oddities

01:40:47.459 --> 01:40:50.420
and the infirmities
of my precious daughter, Gail.

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:53.715
But upon meeting her
just once...

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:56.801
14 other visits were spawned.

01:40:59.304 --> 01:41:01.723
Finally, Father Spinozi...

01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:05.727
allows to my wife and I that...

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.648
our daughter, Gail,
is possessed...

01:41:11.608 --> 01:41:13.026
by an evil entity.

01:41:14.235 --> 01:41:15.653
And she must...

01:41:17.489 --> 01:41:20.742
be exposed
to an exorcism to remove it.

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:24.829
An exorcism, can you imagine?

01:41:24.871 --> 01:41:29.125
Catholic ritual
that squeezes and wrings out...

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:32.629
every essence of your soul
except for that...

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:35.507
which is the very purest.

01:41:37.801 --> 01:41:39.093
He said that...

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.765
if it didn't kill her,
that it would cure her,

01:41:43.807 --> 01:41:46.309
and that she'd be under
God's love and protection

01:41:46.351 --> 01:41:48.895
for the rest of her life,
forever and ever.

01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:52.524
Of course, we'd have done
anything for our daughter

01:41:52.565 --> 01:41:56.152
at that point,
and we-- we agreed.

01:41:58.655 --> 01:41:59.906
Father Spinozi...

01:42:01.491 --> 01:42:04.202
learned that this evil...

01:42:05.912 --> 01:42:10.250
preys on weakness of the parents
to get to the child.

01:42:10.291 --> 01:42:12.961
That's how it overtakes
a family.

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:14.963
Through the parents.

01:42:15.964 --> 01:42:19.050
You can imagine our shame.
My shame.

01:42:21.386 --> 01:42:22.470
He also...

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.641
allowed to me the name...

01:42:27.517 --> 01:42:29.227
of this evil, of which...

01:42:30.979 --> 01:42:33.606
I will never allow
to cross my lips

01:42:33.648 --> 01:42:35.775
as long as
I'm on this earth.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:41.489
So he performed the exorcism,
he and his nephew.

01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:44.200
And while
this madness took place,

01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:47.912
the shouting, the banging,
the profanity,

01:42:47.954 --> 01:42:51.082
and then silent, nothing.

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.546
And I came
through that door...

01:42:59.424 --> 01:43:04.137
hoping to see my little girl
leap into my arms.

01:43:07.307 --> 01:43:08.474
And I saw...

01:43:09.517 --> 01:43:12.729
Father Spinozi
laid out on the floor

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:16.357
with a gaping hole in his neck,
his throat torn out,

01:43:16.399 --> 01:43:19.319
strewn across
next to the body.

01:43:22.488 --> 01:43:26.701
23-year-old man,
strong, married...

01:43:28.119 --> 01:43:29.412
father to be.

01:43:34.083 --> 01:43:36.753
I took their bodies,
drug them out

01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:39.505
to the deepest parts
of the forest

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:42.091
where there's a stone well,
and I...

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:46.054
buried those bodies
deep in that well...

01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:49.474
so that their secrets
of the horrors

01:43:49.515 --> 01:43:52.185
that they had been exposed to
here would never be known,

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:53.770
not even to their families

01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:55.980
who know not
what had happened to them,

01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:57.523
what became of them at all.

01:44:01.527 --> 01:44:02.612
And that...

01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:07.700
whatever that was...

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:09.285
was not my daughter.

01:44:11.037 --> 01:44:13.915
That could not be
my little girl.

01:44:15.124 --> 01:44:17.502
So I keep her
confined in a shed,

01:44:17.543 --> 01:44:19.545
so that she will not break
her mother's heart.

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.089
Why are you telling me
these lies?

01:44:22.256 --> 01:44:23.883
Because it is the truth.

01:44:25.301 --> 01:44:27.261
I cannot believe this truth.

01:44:28.805 --> 01:44:30.014
You're a devout man.

01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:33.977
Why has God forsaken you?

01:44:36.187 --> 01:44:37.605
He can mend all of this.

01:44:43.111 --> 01:44:44.278
I don't know.

01:44:48.324 --> 01:44:50.076
I only know you showed up.

01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:53.871
Perhaps this is not about us

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:55.873
but about you.

01:44:57.250 --> 01:44:58.793
And so I must ask you

01:44:58.835 --> 01:45:01.629
a very important question,
Daniel Glassman.

01:45:01.671 --> 01:45:04.090
Do you have a child?

01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:06.259
-No.
-No.

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:08.344
No.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.265
No.

01:45:16.019 --> 01:45:18.229
My blessed wife was right.

01:45:18.730 --> 01:45:19.939
He sent you.

01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:22.358
You're...

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.402
you're our savior.

01:45:24.444 --> 01:45:25.611
You are here...

01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:27.989
to cure us.

01:45:28.031 --> 01:45:30.533
You and you alone,
a warrior,

01:45:30.575 --> 01:45:33.327
has been sent from above.

01:45:33.369 --> 01:45:35.955
You are here to do

01:45:35.997 --> 01:45:39.333
what I neither have the courage
nor the strength to do.

01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:40.918
-And you must.
-No, I can't.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.587
-I can't.
-You must do it.

01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:45.715
That is why you've been sent,
Daniel Glassman.

01:45:45.757 --> 01:45:47.341
Gather yourself, man.

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:48.801
-Please don't ask me.
-Gather yourself.

01:45:48.843 --> 01:45:49.969
You...

01:45:50.845 --> 01:45:52.305
must listen to me.

01:45:53.056 --> 01:45:56.309
You must be ready to do this.
Do you understand?

01:45:57.143 --> 01:45:59.437
You need to do this for us.

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:03.024
You must be focused.

01:46:03.066 --> 01:46:04.150
No missteps.

01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:07.028
Aim straight.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.363
Shoot to kill.

01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:11.449
This is my family
we're talking about.

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:13.993
There can be no--

01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:16.788
there can be no wounds.

01:46:17.413 --> 01:46:18.748
You must do this.

01:46:19.999 --> 01:46:21.501
Ready...

01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:22.585
tomorrow.

01:46:23.544 --> 01:46:25.505
I'll supply you the means.

01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.301
Send us back to the good Lord
from whence we came,

01:46:30.343 --> 01:46:31.677
Daniel Glassman.

01:46:32.762 --> 01:46:34.472
This is your destiny.

01:46:36.265 --> 01:46:37.767
You'll be a witness for him.

01:46:38.893 --> 01:46:43.189
For everyone to tell
what you've seen and heard here.

01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:47.485
Everyone who follows the truth
will hear your voice.

01:46:49.112 --> 01:46:50.446
-Tomorrow.
-[Daniel sobs]

01:46:52.657 --> 01:46:53.783

01:48:40.806 --> 01:48:41.891
Soldier.

01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:44.685
I have your breakfast.

01:48:53.819 --> 01:48:54.946

Do something. Oh, God.

Oh, God.

01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:30.356
Soldier,
what has happened to you?

01:49:35.236 --> 01:49:36.445
Oh, God!

Stay away from me!

-No!
-Stay away from me!

01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:15.234
No! No! [sobbing]

01:50:16.235 --> 01:50:17.320
[Gabe weakly] Please...

01:50:18.029 --> 01:50:19.238
finish it.

01:50:25.619 --> 01:50:28.372
Make it swift
for all of us, please.

01:50:29.582 --> 01:50:31.792
I'm with-- I'm with child.

01:50:31.834 --> 01:50:33.169
I'm sorry, Elsie.

01:50:34.295 --> 01:50:35.963
This is what he wanted.

help me to remember the cross

that you carried for my sake
so I may better carry mine.

don't miss, Daniel.

[Gail] Send us back to God.

God forgive me!

For the love of God...

01:57:48.729 --> 01:57:49.813
What is this insanity?

[Heysinger] I told you.

01:57:51.607 --> 01:57:55.277
Think, think,
think it out, Clayton.

01:57:55.319 --> 01:57:57.696
Think it out. How does it fit?

How does it fit?

01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:01.241
It doesn't fit.

How can it be you?

You were already here.

01:58:09.291 --> 01:58:10.876
There's no way
you killed the Spinozis.

01:58:11.835 --> 01:58:13.462
The missing kid...

01:58:13.504 --> 01:58:15.297
-he jumps back and forth.
-What?

01:58:15.339 --> 01:58:17.925
[Heysinger] He uses the kids,
the missing Spinozi kid.

01:58:17.966 --> 01:58:19.426
Oh, come on. That's insane.

01:58:19.468 --> 01:58:21.345
-[Rose] Devil.
-Huh?

01:58:22.054 --> 01:58:25.224
The letters spelled
"devil in Daniel."

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:27.059
He said you were next.
You and your family.

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:28.727
He's been saying that
for years.

01:58:28.769 --> 01:58:30.687
Tell him, Daniel.
Tell him.

01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:33.816
[Daniel] Oh, please Lord,
help me.

01:58:33.857 --> 01:58:36.485
[gasping]

01:58:38.153 --> 01:58:42.908
There is no sun
where it's from.

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:47.371
Don't let
the darkness through.

01:58:49.331 --> 01:58:52.417
Daniel, could you explain
what you meant?

01:58:52.459 --> 01:58:54.711
Earlier you spoke about
the Spinozi boy.

01:58:55.546 --> 01:58:56.922
Yes.

01:58:56.964 --> 01:58:58.257
You said you used
the Spinozi boy

01:58:58.298 --> 01:58:59.383
to kill his family, how?

01:58:59.424 --> 01:59:01.134
How?

01:59:01.176 --> 01:59:02.553
[young Daniel voice]
Oh, Thomas he was so nice.

01:59:02.594 --> 01:59:04.429
I thought I could save him.

01:59:04.471 --> 01:59:06.348
[Heysinger]
Christ in heaven.

01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:09.142
He has had his hand
around her neck for years.

01:59:09.184 --> 01:59:12.479
[eerie laugh]

01:59:12.521 --> 01:59:14.147
It affects everything.

01:59:15.816 --> 01:59:20.946
Your son's death,
your dark emotions.

01:59:20.988 --> 01:59:23.782
What are you saying?
What are you saying to me?

01:59:23.824 --> 01:59:26.326
Leave this place! Run!

01:59:26.368 --> 01:59:27.786
[Heysinger]
I brought you the detective.

01:59:27.828 --> 01:59:29.663
[Daniel groaning]

01:59:34.418 --> 01:59:37.045
[young Daniel voice]
Elsie Proctor and her mother...

01:59:37.087 --> 01:59:38.672
Gabe Proctor and Gail...

01:59:39.631 --> 01:59:41.049
Emily Spinozi...

01:59:42.593 --> 01:59:46.305
Gretchen Spinozi,
Meredith Spinozi...

01:59:48.098 --> 01:59:52.728
Alice Douglas,
Clayton Douglas and Anna.

01:59:52.769 --> 01:59:55.397
[screaming]

01:59:55.439 --> 01:59:56.940
Run!

01:59:59.943 --> 02:00:02.237
Saints of God,
come to Daniel.

02:00:02.279 --> 02:00:04.072
Come to meet Daniel,
angels of the Lord.

02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:06.992
Receive his soul and present him
to God the most high.

02:00:07.492 --> 02:00:09.244
May Christ--

02:00:09.286 --> 02:00:11.914
may Christ take hold of you,
take you to himself.

02:00:11.955 --> 02:00:14.291
May angels take you
to Abraham--

02:00:14.333 --> 02:00:15.417
[Daniel roars]

02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:26.595
[high-pitched ringing]

02:00:59.586 --> 02:01:01.838
[coughing]

02:01:29.366 --> 02:01:31.243
[panting]

02:01:46.091 --> 02:01:47.926
[grunting]

02:01:54.141 --> 02:01:56.852
[Daniel roaring]

02:01:58.353 --> 02:02:00.731
Clayton.

02:02:02.107 --> 02:02:03.942
[tense music playing]

02:02:16.955 --> 02:02:18.081
[Clayton] Glassman!

02:02:22.627 --> 02:02:24.046
Glassman!

02:02:25.505 --> 02:02:26.715
Glassman!

02:02:27.674 --> 02:02:29.051
Glassman!

02:02:40.562 --> 02:02:42.731
[wheezing]

02:02:45.192 --> 02:02:46.777
You were lying, Glassman.

02:02:47.944 --> 02:02:49.362
If that's who you really are.

02:02:50.781 --> 02:02:53.158
[evil Daniel] Clayton Douglas.

02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:57.370
Clayton Douglas.

02:03:01.249 --> 02:03:04.002
God only knows, or cares.

02:03:08.298 --> 02:03:10.634
No. Stay where you are
or I'll drop you.

02:03:11.218 --> 02:03:14.846
Clayton Douglas,
son of Kevin...

02:03:14.888 --> 02:03:16.098
[demonic whispering] Kevin.

02:03:16.139 --> 02:03:17.474
...the one who quits.

02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:21.394
[chuckling] Oh, I can taste you.

02:03:22.562 --> 02:03:23.688
Stay back.

02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:27.234
I know you, son.

02:03:28.151 --> 02:03:30.362
-I know your soul.
-[demonic voices echoing]

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:33.490
-Blackness. Rot.
-[demonic voices echoing]

02:03:33.532 --> 02:03:36.952
-Just like mine.
-[demonic voices echoing]

02:03:36.993 --> 02:03:38.787
You know your wife knows
what you did.

02:03:38.829 --> 02:03:40.747
-[demonic voice] She knows.
-She knows what you did.

02:03:40.789 --> 02:03:42.707
[demonic voices echoing]

02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:46.336
Killed your boy, crippled
your daughter with your rage.

02:03:47.045 --> 02:03:48.421
She doesn't love you.

02:03:48.463 --> 02:03:50.382
[demonic voices echoing]

02:03:50.423 --> 02:03:52.467
What you did to your boy.

02:03:53.135 --> 02:03:55.637
-Sin.
-[demonic voice] Sin.

02:03:55.679 --> 02:03:58.932
Jesus doesn't love you.
Only I love you.

02:03:58.974 --> 02:04:00.225
I know you.

02:04:01.935 --> 02:04:03.353
It was an accident.

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:11.236
Head caved, disemboweled,
neck snapped...

02:04:12.154 --> 02:04:13.989
crushed red ball.

02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:17.450
Your rage killed your son.
You killed your son!

02:04:19.202 --> 02:04:20.579
Jesus doesn't love you.

02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:21.830
[demonic voices echoing]

02:04:21.872 --> 02:04:23.415
Only I love you.

02:04:24.958 --> 02:04:26.960
I'm-- I'm not it, Glassman.

02:04:27.919 --> 02:04:29.462
Yes, you are, my son.

02:04:30.672 --> 02:04:32.883
Jesus doesn't love you,
she doesn't love you.

02:04:32.924 --> 02:04:34.593
God loves me, you fucker.

02:04:41.141 --> 02:04:42.267
[young Daniel] Don't kill it.

02:04:43.059 --> 02:04:44.603
That's what it wants.

02:04:46.438 --> 02:04:48.273
Go. Go home, please.

02:04:48.315 --> 02:04:49.900
Just run. Just go home.

02:04:50.609 --> 02:04:52.652
It'll take your family
if you kill it.

02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:55.155
Please, please.
You have to run.

02:04:55.906 --> 02:04:56.948
You have to run.

02:04:58.241 --> 02:04:59.326
Daniel?

02:04:59.367 --> 02:05:00.744
[disembodied screaming]

02:05:00.785 --> 02:05:02.913
-No!

02:05:15.967 --> 02:05:17.886
[choking]

02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:28.897
No! [groans] Oh, my heart.
Don't let this happen.

02:05:28.939 --> 02:05:30.440
Don't let this happen.

02:05:30.482 --> 02:05:32.317
[sobbing] Help me.

02:05:32.359 --> 02:05:34.069
Help me.

02:05:35.028 --> 02:05:37.113
[groaning]

02:05:37.155 --> 02:05:40.617

I love you.

02:06:27.789 --> 02:06:29.749
[Alice] No.
I've been trying all night.

02:06:31.042 --> 02:06:33.378
[sighs] Can-- can you just--

02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:35.547
can you just have someone go out
and look for him?

02:06:36.798 --> 02:06:39.551
No, you don't understand.
I think he's stranded out there.

02:06:41.386 --> 02:06:42.470
Yes.

02:06:43.471 --> 02:06:45.473
Yes, yes.
He went to work yesterday.

02:06:45.515 --> 02:06:46.933
He was there all day.

02:06:47.976 --> 02:06:50.186
No, he never made it home.

02:06:50.979 --> 02:06:54.566
[exhales sharply] No.
He's still not home.

02:06:54.607 --> 02:06:56.609
Why aren't you
understanding me?

02:06:57.819 --> 02:07:00.155
Can you please just send
someone out to look for him?

02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:04.367
No. I know
how bad the roads are.

02:07:04.409 --> 02:07:05.744
Don't you have any trucks?

02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:07.829
Just get out there, please.

02:07:08.371 --> 02:07:10.457
What?
What do you mean he quit?

02:07:12.751 --> 02:07:13.835
What?

02:07:15.295 --> 02:07:16.796
What?

02:07:28.433 --> 02:07:29.517
Daddy?

02:07:30.352 --> 02:07:31.561
Hi, daddy.

02:07:37.817 --> 02:07:40.487
[Clayton] No!
Anna, I love you.

02:07:40.528 --> 02:07:42.155
-[Anna] Daddy! Daddy! No!
-[gunshot]

02:07:42.947 --> 02:07:43.990
[Anna] Mommy.

02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:51.122
[sobbing] Oh! Oh, my God!
What happened?

02:07:51.164 --> 02:07:52.791
[Anna] He just came in
and he just shot himself.

02:07:52.832 --> 02:07:55.001
[sobbing]

02:07:56.294 --> 02:07:57.921

[eerie laugh]

02:08:48.596 --> 02:08:50.098
Back so soon.

02:08:53.393 --> 02:08:56.855
The detective beat you.
He won.

02:09:00.859 --> 02:09:02.527
I told you.

02:09:04.112 --> 02:09:05.321
I told you.

02:09:07.532 --> 02:09:10.785
And I'll win the next one
and the next one and the next.

02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:17.000
You're staying with me.

02:09:23.131 --> 02:09:25.049
[Heysinger]
But I sincerely believe

02:09:25.091 --> 02:09:27.552
he's harboring
a negative force.

02:09:27.594 --> 02:09:29.596
[Daniel]
That actually empowered me.

02:09:30.847 --> 02:09:33.433
A life without purpose
is a waste of it.

02:09:34.559 --> 02:09:36.936
It took the devil
to lay its hands on my
shoulders

02:09:36.978 --> 02:09:38.271
to awaken mine.

02:09:39.606 --> 02:09:41.649
I would allow it
to swallow the flies

02:09:41.691 --> 02:09:44.152
until this spider
is too large to ignore.

02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:48.573
No longer can it stay cloaked
within the faithless.

02:09:49.991 --> 02:09:51.493
This is God's work.
