WEBVTT

00:50.092 --> 00:51.135
Shh.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.144
The ghost of Hyde!

02:02.290 --> 02:05.584
- How was the magic show tonight?
- Terrific.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.422
- And so are these double-fudge sundaes.
- With a pickle on top.

02:09.588 --> 02:14.093
- I want to do a magic trick.
- You want to do a magic trick?

02:14.343 --> 02:17.179
- Uh-huh.
- Like, this I got to see.

02:17.346 --> 02:21.559
Hocus-pocus, alley-cop.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.603
Hey! What kind of a magic trick is that?

02:35.740 --> 02:38.617
That's called
"the vanishing ice-cream trick," Shaggy.

02:38.951 --> 02:43.622
Well, next time he tries it, I'm gonna pull
"the vanishing Scooby trick."

02:48.085 --> 02:50.421
Come on, gang.
It's time we head for home.

02:50.588 --> 02:54.258
Yeah, I wanna catch
the early late show on TV.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.595
It's called <i>I Was</i> a <i>Teenage Blob.</i>

02:57.762 --> 03:00.931
I saw that. Boy, was it corny.

03:02.475 --> 03:05.895
The blob would hide in the back of cars
and wait for his victims.

03:12.151 --> 03:15.571
This creepy shortcut you're taking,
Freddy, gives me the chills.

03:15.738 --> 03:19.158
- Yeah. Like, me too.
- That's because the heater is broken.

03:19.575 --> 03:22.453
Scooby, fetch the beach blanket
so we can bundle up.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.996
Okay.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.459
Excuse me.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.131
Like, what is it, Scoob?

03:37.635 --> 03:39.970
I think he's had too many ice creams.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.480
A ghost!

03:59.782 --> 04:02.201
Look! The ghost is going
into the marshes.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.203
Did you get a look at his face?

04:04.412 --> 04:08.624
Yeah. He'd make a fortune renting
himself out to Halloween parties.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.837
That's not what I meant.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.214
That's the ghost of Mr. Hyde.

04:15.423 --> 04:19.176
You mean that creepy jewel thief
who's been scaring everybody in town?

04:19.343 --> 04:20.553
The very same.

04:20.719 --> 04:24.515
Like, I wonder what Hyde was doing
hiding in the Mystery Machine.

04:24.682 --> 04:28.686
Well, there's one way to find out.
Come on, let's follow him.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.573
He went into that spooky-looking
old house.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.199
They always do.

04:42.366 --> 04:47.371
- Don't tell me you're scared.
- Me, scared? Like, don't be silly.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.211
Then why are you biting Scooby's nails?

04:55.546 --> 04:58.215
So I am. Sorry, Scooby.

05:00.050 --> 05:04.889
Come on. Let's see if we can find
a back way into that creepy old place.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.391
Hey, the back door is unlocked.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.852
This is gonna be easier
than we thought.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.274
- What happened?
- What was that?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.913
Phew.

05:29.497 --> 05:33.125
Like, wouldn't you know that back
door would trigger a trap door?

05:33.292 --> 05:35.252
Yeah, and look where we landed.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.923
Right in the middle
of a mad scientist-type laboratory.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.092
It must belong to the ghost of Hyde.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.930
Zoinks! Someone's coming.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.268
Hey, that's not Hyde.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.145
What are you kids doing here?

05:53.312 --> 05:56.524
Would you believe we're
looking for a ghost?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.659
That's how we ended up
in your lab, Dr. Jekyll.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.537
Boy, are we glad you didn't
turn out to be Mr. Hyde.

06:09.662 --> 06:12.331
- Yeah. Glad.
- Well, kids...

06:12.540 --> 06:14.750
I'm not so sure I'm not the ghost.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.460
What do you mean, Dr. Jekyll?

06:16.669 --> 06:19.672
Like my great-grandfather,
the first Dr. Jekyll...

06:19.838 --> 06:22.591
I may also be changing
into the horrible Mr. Hyde...

06:22.758 --> 06:25.344
but this time as his ghost.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.137
- Ghost?
- Ghost?

06:27.346 --> 06:30.057
- But how, sir?
- For the past three years...

06:30.182 --> 06:32.560
I've been working
on a vitamin formula...

06:32.685 --> 06:35.312
that you only have
to take once in your life.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.314
Last week, I perfected it.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.818
<i>And all that was left
to do was to test it.</i>

06:41.277 --> 06:45.656
<i>But something must have gone wrong.
I became dizzy.</i>

06:46.323 --> 06:48.158
<i>And the room began to spin.</i>

06:48.325 --> 06:51.829
<i>Several hours later, I was awakened
by my housekeeper, Helga...</i>

06:51.996 --> 06:53.831
<i>who found me on the floor.</i>

06:53.998 --> 06:57.209
I had fresh mud on my shoes,
like I'd been out in the marsh.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.295
The same thing happened tonight.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.590
And when I awoke,
I found these in my pocket.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.843
That's the necklace we saw
the ghost of Hyde holding.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.970
- That's real.
- So you see...

07:08.137 --> 07:11.515
there is no doubt that
I am the ghost of Hyde.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.475
There's one thing that puzzles me.

07:13.726 --> 07:17.479
If you were in the swamp,
how come the mud on your shoes is dry?

07:17.646 --> 07:19.023
That is strange.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.859
There's something strange
about this whole thing.

07:22.026 --> 07:24.528
We'd like to find out what it is.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.655
Not me.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.665
Freddy said to search the place
from top to bottom.

07:36.832 --> 07:40.169
Wouldn't you know we'd be
the ones to search the attic?

07:45.507 --> 07:49.678
Like, this place looks like
a storeroom for spiderwebs.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.894
Wow, a spooky room filled
with haunted spiderwebs...

07:57.061 --> 07:59.897
and creepy, old-looking chests.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.650
Wonder what's in them.

08:07.780 --> 08:12.076
Funny place to keep bats.
Hope they've all, like, flown the coop.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.744
Hmm.

08:14.370 --> 08:17.289
There's nothing in here
but a bunch of old costumes.

08:25.798 --> 08:28.425
Somebody around here
must have been in show biz.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.302
- Shaggy?
- Yeah?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.727
Zoink!

08:40.270 --> 08:43.816
Very funny. Don't take it off.
You look better with it on.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.446
Now, quit fooling around
and help me search.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.324
You look on that side,
and I'll look on this.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.830
Yipe!

08:57.996 --> 08:59.790
Nothing in that one.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.837
What's with you, Scooby-Doo?

09:13.345 --> 09:15.973
That horrible-looking?

09:16.473 --> 09:19.309
Come on. We'll sneak up on him.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.855
Get ready, Scoob.
I'm gonna open the door.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.274
Aha! Gotcha!

09:26.859 --> 09:30.654
Oh, Scooby, you were only looking
at yourself in a mirror.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.658
This place is creepy.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.954
Like, all we're missing is
a big, old, scary shadow.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.873
Shaggy, look.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.250
Zoinks!

09:43.751 --> 09:46.044
The door is stuck. It won't open.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.506
Huh?

10:02.186 --> 10:04.772
Yipe! Shaggy!

10:04.897 --> 10:07.065
Coming, Scoob!

10:08.776 --> 10:10.986
We're goners.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.031
Friends of the doctor's, no doubt.

10:15.574 --> 10:20.037
You must be Helga. We thought
you were the ghost of Hyde.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.373
Well, you can see I'm not.

10:23.540 --> 10:28.378
And you've made a mess of the attic
just after I finished cleaning it.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.589
Cleaned it?

10:42.810 --> 10:46.814
Like, I wonder what it looked
like before she cleaned it.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.569
I hope Shaggy and Scooby
are having better luck than we are.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.197
Wait a minute.
I think I found a clue.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.951
Looks like someone was in a hurry
to burn something in the fireplace.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.454
- It's an old newspaper clipping.
- And listen to this.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.914
"Helga The Great.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.834
Famous acrobat and trapeze artist,
Helga...

11:06.959 --> 11:11.129
will give a special performance
of her human-fly act on Friday."

11:11.338 --> 11:13.131
Human-fly act?

11:13.340 --> 11:18.136
Yeah. It's a daring acrobatic: act done
on tall buildings and other high places.

11:18.345 --> 11:22.641
Why should a Circus star be working as
a housemaid in a creepy place like this?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.768
I don't know.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.943
Maybe one of these books
will give us a clue.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.945
- Maybe.
- Here's one.

11:35.112 --> 11:39.032
<i>A Hundred and One Ghosts and Ghouls.</i>

11:42.953 --> 11:46.039
Zoinks! We hit the jackpot.

12:02.764 --> 12:03.807
Huh?

12:07.185 --> 12:11.481
Hi, kids. Uncle Happy Time here,
once again, with your favorite dog star...

12:11.648 --> 12:15.485
- King of the Wild Blue Yonder.
- Hi, kiddies.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.362
Huh?

12:18.030 --> 12:21.033
If you don't sign the treaty,
Running Dog...

12:21.199 --> 12:23.952
we'll take back the trinkets and beads.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.162
Uh-uh.

12:25.329 --> 12:28.332
- Indian giver.
- Then go.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.125
Oops.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.921
You know, you ought
to get this set fixed.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.759
This chute leads to the laundry room.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.761
I wonder what's down there.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.971
I wonder what's happened
to Shag and Scoob.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.890
We haven't heard a peep out of them.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.519
Look out below!

12:50.437 --> 12:52.064
Duck!

12:57.194 --> 13:00.364
A perfect three-point landing.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.532
You mean four-point landing.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.369
What were you running
from in the first place?

13:05.535 --> 13:08.372
- Old horrible Hyde.
- You saw him?

13:08.538 --> 13:12.709
In glowing color. Like, Dr. Jekyll
must have changed again.

13:12.876 --> 13:16.630
He couldn't have. We just saw
him reading in his study.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.215
Hey, Shaggy.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.133
- Look.
- Hmm.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.720
It looks like someone was ironing
a shirt with muddy shoes.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.891
You mean it looks more like someone
was hiding a pair of muddy shoes.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.560
And where did this feather duster
come from?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.647
That's the one Helga was
Cleaning spiderwebs with.

13:33.814 --> 13:37.067
- Uh-huh, that's the one.
- Velma?

13:37.234 --> 13:39.987
- Shaggy? Scooby?
- Are you guys all right?

13:40.153 --> 13:44.241
- Couldn't be better. We found a clue.
- Yeah. Clue.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.202
And I have a hunch
we'll find a few more answers...

13:47.369 --> 13:49.663
to this mystery in Helga's room.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.915
Helga's room?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.210
Here it is. Come on. Let's go in.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.922
If you don't mind, I'll wait out here
and guard this bowl of fruit.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.590
- Guard it?
- Sure.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.802
What safer place than in my stomach?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.597
Come on, Scoob.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.683
So far, no luck.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.852
Let's see
what's under the mattress.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.438
Hey, look, a can of phosphorus paint.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.773
And a bottle of knockout drops.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.901
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Freddy?

14:20.068 --> 14:23.947
I'm thinking this mystery is
pretty close to being solved.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.324
We better tell Dr. Jekyll
what we found.

14:26.491 --> 14:30.954
Hey, gang, did I find something
interesting in the fruit bowl.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.460
- The ghost of Hyde!
- And he's got Shaggy.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.462
Shaggy!

14:39.254 --> 14:41.298
They're gone, vanished.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.301
Come on.
We've got to find him, and fast.

14:44.468 --> 14:48.305
Shaggy! Shaggy!

15:05.322 --> 15:07.866
What are you gonna do with me?

15:08.033 --> 15:10.660
You're gonna turn me into a frog.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.457
Like, I think he's going to croak me.

15:15.707 --> 15:20.003
Oh, Scooby-Doo, where are you?

15:21.004 --> 15:23.423
Shaggy!

16:57.642 --> 17:00.437
I wish I had a Scooby Snack.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.794
Shaggy, Scooby.

17:24.961 --> 17:30.675
- Thank goodness you're safe.
- You mean thank Scooby we're safe.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.888
What I'd like to know is why
Hyde was after you, Shag.

17:35.055 --> 17:39.142
Maybe he was, like, after these suction
cups. I found them in the fruit bowl.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.144
Sounds pretty silly to me.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.813
What would he want with suction cups?

17:43.980 --> 17:46.650
Beats me, but with the
clues we have so far...

17:46.816 --> 17:50.237
it's for sure the ghost of Hyde
is a 24-karat phony.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.281
And we know who that
24-karat phony is.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.617
- We do?
- Now it's our turn...

17:55.784 --> 17:58.787
to scare the hide off of Hyde.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.881
For <i>he's</i> an <i>ugly</i> bad <i>fellow</i>

18:10.048 --> 18:12.759
<i>That nobody can deny</i>

18:17.264 --> 18:19.432
The plan's working, Scoob.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.770
We'll lure him into the trick trap.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.625
No!

18:58.096 --> 19:00.932
- Boo!
- Ghosts!

19:01.099 --> 19:03.601
- It worked.
- Ghosts!

19:03.768 --> 19:06.438
- He's headed for the back door.
- And the trap door.

19:12.902 --> 19:16.948
- We got him, Scooby.
- Scooby-Doo!

19:17.574 --> 19:21.286
Nice catch, guys.
Now to unmask this phony Hyde.

19:21.453 --> 19:25.749
And if our calculations are right,
it should be Helga, the housemaid.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.336
Dr. Jekyll!

19:29.502 --> 19:33.465
So it really was Dr. Jekyll behind
the ghost of Hyde jewel robberies.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.010
It sure was, sheriff.
When all his crazy experiments failed...

19:37.177 --> 19:39.971
Dr. Jekyll decided to turn
to a life of crime.

19:40.138 --> 19:44.017
But one thing he didn't count on
was us following him into the marsh.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.978
And, like, when he figured he
might be caught...

19:47.145 --> 19:50.148
he came up with the idea of
framing Helga, the maid.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.859
Shame on you, Dr. Jekyll.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.321
First he told us that phony
story about the formula.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.115
Then he planted fake clues
for us to find...

19:59.282 --> 20:03.411
that would make it look like
Helga was the ghost of Hyde.

20:04.329 --> 20:08.166
His plan almost worked, except that
Shaggy found the suction cups...

20:08.333 --> 20:10.460
which turned out to be the real clue.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.755
When he tried to get them back
and keep Shag from telling...

20:13.922 --> 20:18.009
everything backfired, and he ended up
caught in one of our traps.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.887
Why were the suction cups
such an important clue?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.889
- Show him, Scoob.
- Okay.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.851
Dr. Jekyll had to use
the suction cups to scale the buildings.

20:27.018 --> 20:30.438
If Helga was the ghost of Hyde,
she wouldn't have needed them...

20:30.605 --> 20:33.566
- because she was an ex-circus star.
- Hey, like, look.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.027
Scoob thinks he's a Circus star too.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.366
Oh, no, Scooby's gonna fall.

20:45.537 --> 20:48.206
I gotta admit, that's some act.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.584
Scooby-Doo!

21:42.093 --> 21:43.219
Shh.
