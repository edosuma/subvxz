Hello?!

[footsteps approaching]

00:17.922 --> 00:21.657
Is somebody there?
Who is that?

[continues whimpering]

00:24.529 --> 00:27.630
Hey!
What are you doing?

00:27.665 --> 00:29.431
[both grunting]

00:34.605 --> 00:37.773
Run!
Run!

00:37.808 --> 00:39.808

- Aah!

00:59.490 --> 01:01.424
It's done. I-I've
already canceled the deal.

01:01.459 --> 01:03.159
But you loved that condo.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.862
Yeah, but I can't risk my
new neighbors getting hurt

01:05.897 --> 01:08.998
if this whack job decides he
wants to burn down my place again.

01:09.033 --> 01:11.167
Okay, so you're just going to
stay at Frankie's indefinitely?

01:11.202 --> 01:14.137
- Mm-hmm.
-  Okay. What if you can have

01:14.138 --> 01:17.073
an entire townhouse to
yourself, no neighbors?

01:17.108 --> 01:19.208
Well, then I would be rich.

01:19.244 --> 01:22.378
- And I wouldn't be a detective.
- My friend Rick Sullivan ...

01:22.413 --> 01:24.547
he's a medieval-studies
professor at BCU ...

01:24.582 --> 01:27.350
- Yawn.
- He's leaving on sabbatical,

01:27.385 --> 01:30.920
and he offered to let you
sublet his home while he is away.

01:30.955 --> 01:33.055
And it's a block from me.

01:33.091 --> 01:36.492
Ugh. That means it's
a block away from Ma, too.

01:36.527 --> 01:40.129
Wha... okay, did you tell him
that my apartment burned down?

01:40.164 --> 01:43.099
I did, and it turns out that
the townhouse is owned by BCU,

01:43.134 --> 01:45.334
so it's insured, and he's
willing to take the risk.

01:45.370 --> 01:49.338
- Hey, Ma.
- I wasn't snooping, I swear.

01:49.374 --> 01:51.073
I don't believe it for one second.

01:51.109 --> 01:52.675
She was totally snooping.
Why? What?

01:52.710 --> 01:55.444
No, no, I needed to go into Vince's desk

01:55.480 --> 02:00.016
- to get the inventory from last month.
- Mm-hmm...

02:00.051 --> 02:02.102
And, um...

02:02.103 --> 02:05.154
- I found... this.
- [gasps] No.

02:05.189 --> 02:07.223
- Did you open it?
- Of course not.

02:07.258 --> 02:09.258
- Liar!
- Maybe.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.960
Okay, let's see.

02:10.995 --> 02:14.397
Vince is gonna propose to Kiki!
[all gasp]

02:14.432 --> 02:16.032
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

02:16.067 --> 02:18.100
The sergeant has excellent taste.

02:18.136 --> 02:20.469
- Mm.
- No!

02:20.505 --> 02:21.971
It's bad luck.

02:22.006 --> 02:24.307
What bad lu...
I've never heard of that before.

02:24.342 --> 02:26.375
Yeah, I'm not aware of
that superstition, either.

02:26.411 --> 02:29.912
Yeah, it's bad luck. You have to
let your mother try it on first.

02:29.948 --> 02:31.881
[cellphones buzz]

02:31.916 --> 02:33.215
Sneaky, Ma.
[cellphone beeps]

02:33.251 --> 02:36.452
- I like that. Rizzoli.
- Isles.

02:36.487 --> 02:37.920
- Give it to me.
- Okay, here.

02:37.956 --> 02:40.089
- Try it on.
- Here.

02:40.124 --> 02:41.190
[grunts]

02:41.225 --> 02:44.493
- Okay, it's tight.
- Yeah, maybe it really is bad luck.

02:44.529 --> 02:47.496
That is exactly how
superstitions get started.

02:47.532 --> 02:49.613
<i>Okay, yeah, I'm on my way.</i>

<b>6x15 - "Scared to Death"</b>

03:13.391 --> 03:16.325
- Think Kiki will say yes?
- I hope so.

03:16.361 --> 03:18.394
I mean, she and Korsak seem
to make an excellent match.

03:18.429 --> 03:21.030
- Yeah.
- You don't think so?

03:21.065 --> 03:24.266
No, I-I think they're great together.
He seems very happy.

03:24.302 --> 03:26.902
I actually heard him giggle yesterday.

03:26.938 --> 03:29.905
You're worried if he gets
married, things will change.

03:29.941 --> 03:32.975
Things will change.
He'll be married, and he'll be happy,

03:33.011 --> 03:34.510
- and then he'll leave the force.
- You don't know that.

03:34.545 --> 03:38.447
- Watch.
- At least you have me.

03:38.483 --> 03:40.316
Yeah, but you don't carry a gun.

03:40.351 --> 03:45.921
- No, but I am fantastic with a scalpel.
- Very true.

03:45.957 --> 03:49.125
Just... I can't imagine doing
this without him, you know?

03:49.160 --> 03:50.926
He's always been there for me.

03:50.962 --> 03:52.461
Don't say anything about the ring, okay?

03:52.497 --> 03:54.563
Just let him bring
it up in his own time.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.365
- Play it cool.
- Right.

03:56.401 --> 03:59.001
[camera shutter clicks]
Cool.

03:59.037 --> 04:02.705
- Hello, Maura.
- I don't know anything.

04:03.041 --> 04:07.476
About... the case.
I don't know anything about the case.

04:07.512 --> 04:10.379
- What can you tell me?
- I ...

04:10.415 --> 04:14.183
Victim is female, late 20s, no I.D.
Building is abandoned.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.836
Homeless people sometimes camp
out here. one of them found

04:16.837 --> 04:19.454
- her hidden back here.
- Looks like the body has been moved.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.857
Somebody could have been tied up here.

04:21.892 --> 04:25.528
<i>- Korsak: Gag or blindfold, maybe.
- Jane: Mm-hmm.</i>

04:25.563 --> 04:28.030
Maura, do you see any
abrasions on the wrists?

04:31.669 --> 04:34.236
No. No, I, uh...

04:34.272 --> 04:37.306
don't see any rope burns
or abrasions on the skin.

04:37.341 --> 04:40.276
Maura, we can have
Kent here in 15 minutes.

04:40.311 --> 04:44.447
- You don't have to be here.
- I'm fine.

04:44.482 --> 04:48.517
If somebody was tied up,
it's unlikely that it was our victim.

04:48.553 --> 04:51.620
Well, maybe she was the
abductor and not the abductee.

04:51.656 --> 04:54.590
<i>Based on decomposition and
the bloating of the intestines,</i>

04:54.625 --> 04:57.593
I'd estimate the time of death
to be at least five days ago.

04:57.628 --> 05:01.597
- So sometime over the weekend.
- I see at least two stab wounds

05:01.632 --> 05:05.234
and what appear to be
several defensive injuries.

05:05.269 --> 05:08.037
We'll look under the
fingernails for DNA.

05:08.072 --> 05:11.340
- Work boot?
- Man's size 11.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.909
So what happened?
Guy with size 11 boots is tied up,

05:13.945 --> 05:16.479
manages to get away, stabs
his abductor a couple of times?

05:16.514 --> 05:20.015
Maybe somebody else was tied up here.
[door bangs open]

05:20.051 --> 05:22.984
Hey. You guys need to see this.

05:32.029 --> 05:33.295
Looks like it was used

05:33.331 --> 05:35.231
as some sort of
improvised torture chamber.

05:35.266 --> 05:38.033
Uh, there's a lot of blood.
No more bodies.

05:38.069 --> 05:40.636
- We search the whole building?
- Yeah. It's clear.

05:40.671 --> 05:44.039
But... we found this over in the corner.

05:44.075 --> 05:48.310
It's a digital encryption key,
like they have at banks.

05:48.346 --> 05:50.279
We'll see if Nina can
track down the owner.

05:50.314 --> 05:52.314
This place gives me the creeps.

05:54.452 --> 05:56.452
These are pretty solid walls.

05:56.487 --> 05:59.555
Somebody could scream in here for hours,
nobody'd ever hear them.

06:02.727 --> 06:05.227
<i>Frankie: So, our victim
has a criminal record.</i>

06:05.263 --> 06:09.298
Daniella Gibbs.
What'd she get picked up for?

06:09.333 --> 06:12.301
Uh, mostly misdemeanors.
Couple of drunk and disorderlies,

06:12.336 --> 06:16.071
and a minor possession charge.
All in Atlanta.

06:16.107 --> 06:17.606
- Anything local?
- No.

06:17.642 --> 06:19.772
And I'm not finding a Boston address

06:19.807 --> 06:22.378
or records of employment
in the state, either.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.713
Okay.
Uh, let's call Atlanta P.D.,

06:24.749 --> 06:26.348
see if they have anything more on her.

06:26.384 --> 06:28.150
- I'll give them a call.
- Hey, thanks.

06:28.185 --> 06:30.252
Did you hear from that computer
genius you talked to at M.I.T.?

06:30.288 --> 06:33.088
He analyzed all the data from
the hacks on Jane's bank accounts.

06:33.124 --> 06:34.657
Did you give him the
videotape of the arson, too?

06:34.692 --> 06:36.325
I gave him everything.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.960
He thinks he discovered
the hacker's signature,

06:37.995 --> 06:39.495
a piece of code
embedded in all his hacks

06:39.530 --> 06:41.798
- so he can take credit for them.
- Identifying that hacker

06:41.799 --> 06:44.233
might be the only way that we
find out who's behind all this.

06:44.268 --> 06:46.168
I sent the code signature to the FBI

06:46.203 --> 06:49.171
so they can run it against
their hacker database.

06:49.206 --> 06:51.273
They might be able to
give us something to go on.

06:51.309 --> 06:52.975
Mm, keep me informed.

06:53.010 --> 06:56.178
- Keep you informed of what?
- This is no longer an urgent kidnapping.

06:56.213 --> 06:59.081
This is a plain, old-fashioned
police investigation,

06:59.116 --> 07:01.984
- in which you are the victim.
- Sweet!

07:02.019 --> 07:03.686
Old-fashioned investigations
are my speciality.

07:03.721 --> 07:05.421
You can't investigate your own case.

07:05.456 --> 07:07.222
If you do,
any decent defense attorney

07:07.258 --> 07:09.058
will get whatever we find thrown out.

07:09.093 --> 07:11.060
You need to trust us to do our job.

07:11.095 --> 07:13.128
On a different note, I do have something

07:13.164 --> 07:15.331
on that encryption key
found at the murder scene.

07:15.366 --> 07:17.299
<i>It's a digital account authenticator.</i>

07:17.335 --> 07:19.836
The serial number for this
one is registered to an

07:19.837 --> 07:22.338
assistant manager at
First Cambridge bank, Perry Shaw.

07:22.373 --> 07:26.108
- Any criminal record?
- Clean as a whistle. And I just called ...

07:26.143 --> 07:28.077
he's at work today, so
he wasn't another victim.

07:28.112 --> 07:32.348
- We should go talk to him.
- Yes, we should. After you.

07:35.152 --> 07:38.030
[whispers] You find anything on that hacker,
I want to know about it.

07:40.424 --> 07:43.258
[music]

07:43.294 --> 07:45.127
I'm just looking out
for the investigation.

07:45.162 --> 07:48.497
- I'm not keeping secrets from you.
- You're keeping a few secrets.

07:48.532 --> 07:54.036
- Nope. I'm an open book.
- Yeah? Okay.

07:54.071 --> 07:58.407
How do you, uh, propose
that we approach this guy?

07:58.442 --> 08:01.677
You just want to...
engage him directly?

08:01.712 --> 08:03.278
Whatever you think's best.

08:03.314 --> 08:06.202
- I-I'm not married to the idea. I just...
- Okay. Sounds good.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.264
- I'll see you then.
- Excuse me, Mr. Shaw?

08:08.299 --> 08:10.352
- Yes?
- Boston P.D.

08:10.388 --> 08:13.455
Uh, we have something
that you seem to have lost.

08:13.491 --> 08:15.057
Oh, my authenticator.

08:15.092 --> 08:18.193
Thank God.
That was gonna be such a hassle to...

08:18.229 --> 08:20.028
Wait, why do you ...
why do you have it?

08:20.064 --> 08:22.097
- Where did you lose it?
- I'm not sure, exactly.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.032
I noticed it was missing
on Monday morning.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.402
It was found in an abandoned
building over on 2nd Street.

08:26.437 --> 08:30.305
That makes sense.
That was kind of a crazy night. [chuckles]

08:30.341 --> 08:33.609
Mr. Shaw, why were you in that building?

08:33.644 --> 08:37.346
The club? Like everyone else?

08:37.381 --> 08:38.981
The Fear Club.

08:39.015 --> 08:41.049
You buy a ticket, they
scare the hell out of you.

08:41.118 --> 08:42.650
Saturday night's was really intense.

08:42.686 --> 08:45.554
Are you telling us that
this whole thing is a game?

08:45.589 --> 08:49.358
More like a personal
theater event, uh...

08:49.393 --> 08:50.659
totally terrifying.
[chuckles]

08:50.694 --> 08:53.462
I screamed my ass off.
It's fantastic.

08:53.497 --> 08:55.431
So, just, can I have
my authenticator back?

08:55.466 --> 08:59.001
No, you can't. It's evidence
in an ongoing investigation.

08:59.036 --> 09:01.904
A murder investigation.

09:01.939 --> 09:04.473
Somebody got killed?
For real?

09:04.508 --> 09:07.943
Yeah.
It's fantastic, right?

09:07.978 --> 09:09.799
Uh...

09:17.639 --> 09:21.240
[music]

09:21.276 --> 09:23.843
- What's up?
- Well, the test results came back

09:23.878 --> 09:25.645
on the "blood" we found from the scene.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.213
It's actually a mix of cornstarch,

09:27.248 --> 09:29.649
red food coloring, and chocolate syrup.

09:29.684 --> 09:31.751
- Hollywood blood.
- Basic recipe.

09:31.786 --> 09:34.053
Yeah, that matches what the
banker's been telling us.

09:34.089 --> 09:36.122
He said it was some
kind of performance art,

09:36.157 --> 09:39.626
- like a haunted house on steroids.
- Well, people love to be scared.

09:39.661 --> 09:41.094
All that adrenaline and dopamine ...

09:41.129 --> 09:43.296
the fight-or-flight response
can be very intoxicating.

09:43.331 --> 09:46.265
Yeah, if I want to get intoxicated,
I'm gonna have a beer.

09:46.301 --> 09:47.867
There's enough horrible
things out there.

09:47.902 --> 09:50.136
I don't need to pay for the fake stuff.

09:50.171 --> 09:53.072
Has Nina had any success
on tracking down the hacker?

09:53.108 --> 09:55.174
I don't know. Korsak's
trying to keep me out of it.

09:55.210 --> 09:57.777
Well, I'm sure he's doing what
he thinks is best for the case.

09:57.812 --> 09:59.912
So what am I supposed to do?
Just sit around and wait

09:59.948 --> 10:01.914
until whoever's behind
this makes his next move?

10:01.950 --> 10:04.083
He'll make a mistake, and
you'll be there to catch him.

10:04.119 --> 10:08.321
I won't, if Korsak won't let me
in on the investigation. I ...

10:08.356 --> 10:10.089
[sighs]
What about tattoo lady?

10:10.125 --> 10:12.792
Unfortunately, there was no foreign DNA

10:12.827 --> 10:15.695
on her skin or under her fingernails.

10:15.730 --> 10:18.197
<i>The two stab wounds were made
with a double-edged blade,</i>

10:18.233 --> 10:20.066
though the murder
weapon was rather dull.

10:20.101 --> 10:22.402
And the blows were delivered
with a great deal of force.

10:22.437 --> 10:25.238
- So, a man?
- Or a very strong woman.

10:25.273 --> 10:27.190
I also found trace amounts
of a chemical compound

10:27.191 --> 10:29.108
on the wounds, which I
sent off to be tested.

10:29.144 --> 10:30.743
Any drugs or alcohol?

10:30.779 --> 10:33.246
None, though the liver did
show advanced deterioration

10:33.281 --> 10:36.816
consistent with excessive alcohol use.
One other thing.

10:36.851 --> 10:39.118
We recovered DNA from the strip
of cloth found at the scene,

10:39.154 --> 10:40.753
and we ran it through the system.

10:40.789 --> 10:42.355
No hits,
but we were able to confirm

10:42.390 --> 10:45.091
that it came from a female,
but not Daniella Gibbs.

10:45.126 --> 10:48.094
So we know at least two
people were in the room

10:48.129 --> 10:51.197
when she was murdered ...
woman with the blindfold,

10:51.232 --> 10:53.266
a man who left a bloody boot print.

10:53.301 --> 10:56.775
And we don't have an I.D.
for either one of them.

10:58.403 --> 11:00.420
<i>Perry: No. I've
never seen her before.</i>

11:00.421 --> 11:02.438
She was there the
same night you were.

11:02.474 --> 11:04.941
If you say so, but I didn't see her.

11:07.012 --> 11:08.978
I didn't see anyone because of the hood.

11:09.014 --> 11:10.413
The hood?

11:10.448 --> 11:12.582
I had a hood over my head
almost the entire time.

11:12.617 --> 11:15.184
<i>I was chained to the
wall, could barely move,</i>

11:15.220 --> 11:16.986
<i>couldn't see anything.</i>

11:17.022 --> 11:21.057
This woman was yelling how
she was gonna cut me in half.

11:21.092 --> 11:25.194
Had this buzz saw she
kept bringing closer and...

11:25.230 --> 11:30.400
closer...
I actually peed my pants.

11:30.435 --> 11:32.201
Sounds like money well spent.

11:32.237 --> 11:33.970
[sighs]

11:34.005 --> 11:35.505
How many people were there with you?

11:35.540 --> 11:37.240
No one. Everyone goes in alone.

11:37.275 --> 11:39.676
That's what makes it feel so real.

11:39.711 --> 11:42.612
I mean, it's 100 bucks,
but definitely worth it.

11:42.647 --> 11:45.615
- How do you contact this Fear Club?
- Through their website.

11:45.650 --> 11:47.684
But you got to have a password.

11:47.719 --> 11:51.087
So, you ask for an invitation,
see if they respond.

11:51.122 --> 11:52.488
And what happens if they do?

11:52.524 --> 11:55.258
The night of the event,
they send you an address

11:55.293 --> 11:58.394
and an entrance time and a code word.

11:58.430 --> 11:59.696
It's always someplace different.

11:59.731 --> 12:01.397
And you have no idea who runs it?

12:01.433 --> 12:04.033
I told you, no.
I swear, it's all anonymous.

12:04.069 --> 12:06.669
Then we're gonna need the
website and the password.

12:13.078 --> 12:15.011
<i>Nina: Yeah, we did a
raffle in little league.</i>

12:15.046 --> 12:17.580
Got a bunch of money for
bats and mitts and things.

12:17.616 --> 12:19.015
- Cool.
- It was fun.

12:19.050 --> 12:23.319
Well, here.
I'll take 10 tickets.

12:23.355 --> 12:24.921
Really? Thanks.
That's so nice.

12:24.956 --> 12:26.289
It's for a good cause.

12:26.324 --> 12:28.057
Yeah. If we raise
enough, the St. Barnabus

12:28.093 --> 12:30.326
after-school program
can get a new playground.

12:30.362 --> 12:33.463
- That's so great.
- Did you say St. Barnabus?

12:33.498 --> 12:37.934
Um, thanks again. Bye!

12:37.969 --> 12:41.137
What a sweet girl.

12:41.172 --> 12:43.172
Um, did you find
anything about the hacker?

12:43.208 --> 12:44.641
I did.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.443
I was just on my way up
to see Sergeant Korsak.

12:47.479 --> 12:50.431
- And?
- I know you think you want

12:50.432 --> 12:53.116
to know what's going on,
but you don't.

12:53.151 --> 12:54.951
Because it might jeopardize
the investigation.

12:54.986 --> 12:57.587
And that's the last thing
you actually want, right?

12:57.622 --> 12:59.156
Fine.

12:59.991 --> 13:03.359
Here. As a consolation,
why don't you take these?

13:03.395 --> 13:06.229
Maybe you'll win the
grand-prize trip to Hawaii.

13:06.264 --> 13:10.466
St. Barnabus closed a year ago.
You've been conned.

13:17.068 --> 13:18.801
[elevator bell dings]

13:21.540 --> 13:23.907
I think I may have something.

13:23.942 --> 13:26.175
Based on what the M.I.T. expert gave me,

13:26.211 --> 13:29.212
- the FBI got a hit off their database.
- What'd they find?

13:29.247 --> 13:32.048
They discovered that same code
signature in several other hacks.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.516
The oldest was three years ago,

13:33.552 --> 13:35.318
an online harassment
case over in Somerville.

13:35.353 --> 13:36.920
Did they identify the hacker?

13:36.955 --> 13:40.189
No. But I tracked down
the victim, Megan Christenson.

13:40.225 --> 13:41.858
She works at a café downtown.

13:41.893 --> 13:44.394
I thought it might be
worth talking to her.

13:44.429 --> 13:45.995
Why don't you interview her?

13:46.031 --> 13:48.298
Oh, I haven't actually done
field work since Chicago.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.966
You went out with Jane recently.

13:50.001 --> 13:53.970
- Only to back her up, not on my own.
- She said you did great.

13:54.005 --> 13:56.139
I know you originally
took the assignment in BRIC

13:56.174 --> 13:58.107
because you wanted to
stay off the streets.

13:58.143 --> 14:01.010
- And because I like the work.
- You're very good at it.

14:01.046 --> 14:04.447
But I also get the feeling
you're hiding in there.

14:07.152 --> 14:12.672
My boyfriend got shot back in Chicago.
He was killed on my beat.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.291
Was there anything you could have done?

14:17.462 --> 14:20.163
- No.
- Then how about giving yourself a break?

14:20.198 --> 14:22.332
You're smart.
You have great instincts.

14:22.367 --> 14:26.736
I'm not suggesting that we
change your assignment, but...

14:26.771 --> 14:29.983
it might be time to exorcise
a few of those demons.

14:33.345 --> 14:36.746
Yeah. I got this.

14:36.781 --> 14:40.183
- Thanks, sergeant.
- You're welcome.

14:40.218 --> 14:42.852
- And, Holiday...
- Yeah?

14:42.887 --> 14:44.387
I'm sorry.

14:50.195 --> 14:51.794
[sighs]

14:51.830 --> 14:54.197
Hey. Did you find
anything on the owners?

14:54.232 --> 14:57.200
Not yet.
The website's run by a dummy corp.

14:57.235 --> 14:59.335
I subpoenaed the records,
but it may take a few days.

14:59.371 --> 15:01.137
Well, keep pushing,
'cause we need the names

15:01.172 --> 15:02.905
of everybody that was there that night.

15:02.941 --> 15:04.974
Well, the password
that Perry Shaw gave us worked.

15:05.010 --> 15:06.409
So I registered for an invite.

15:06.444 --> 15:08.745
Did you find anything
online about this Fear Club?

15:08.780 --> 15:11.114
Uh, not much.
They fly under the radar.

15:11.149 --> 15:14.083
But it was mentioned
in a few blog posts,

15:14.119 --> 15:15.852
and it sounded pretty awesome.

15:15.887 --> 15:19.055
Do you mean "awesome" as in
"awe-inspiringly stupid"?

15:19.090 --> 15:23.393
Come on.
You used to love horror movies.

15:23.428 --> 15:26.462
Oh, yeah. Remember when
we snuck into that revival

15:26.498 --> 15:29.065
of "Night of the living dead," huh?

15:29.100 --> 15:31.725
- I never heard you scream so loud.
- Shut up!

15:31.760 --> 15:35.038
- You screamed so much louder than I did.
- Yeah. It was great.

15:35.073 --> 15:36.773
Uh, this is kind of like that.

15:36.808 --> 15:39.475
Scream a little, freak out,
then go back to your normal life.

15:39.511 --> 15:43.134
Yes, but Daniella didn't
get to go back to her life.

15:44.783 --> 15:46.315
Maybe one of the guys that works there

15:46.351 --> 15:49.118
got carried away with
his role, took it too far.

15:49.154 --> 15:52.321
Maybe. We won't know until we
find the woman in the blindfold.

15:52.357 --> 15:55.358
Yeah.
It's kind of strange

15:55.393 --> 15:56.926
that no one's reported Daniella missing.

15:56.961 --> 15:58.428
- It's been almost a week.
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.463 --> 16:00.463
<i>Korsak: I tracked down the
guy that owns that building.</i>

16:00.498 --> 16:02.131
He lives in New York, says he's trying

16:02.167 --> 16:04.133
to get the property rezoned
so he can build condos.

16:04.169 --> 16:05.802
Did he rent it out to the Fear Club?

16:05.837 --> 16:07.970
No. He thinks they must have broken in.

16:08.006 --> 16:10.039
He has a security patrol
that drives by occasionally,

16:10.075 --> 16:12.375
but they didn't notice anything.
[beeping]

16:12.410 --> 16:15.043
Oh. We got an invite.

16:18.516 --> 16:20.383

16:30.095 --> 16:32.829
<i>Hate that shit!

16:32.864 --> 16:35.084
That was pretty good.
[chuckles]

16:40.463 --> 16:43.522
According to the banker,
you have only 30 minutes

16:43.557 --> 16:45.924
to get to the Fear Club
location after they contact you.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.026
They use metal detectors,
so you can't take your gun.

16:48.062 --> 16:49.595
- I'll be close by.
- No problem.

16:49.630 --> 16:51.964
And we need to catch at
least one person in the act

16:51.999 --> 16:54.266
so they don't all pretend to be guests.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.235
Toys from the drug-unit guys.

16:56.270 --> 16:58.370
We've got a two-way radio,

16:58.406 --> 17:01.240
- plastic earbud that is completely
undetectable.  - Cool.

17:01.275 --> 17:03.876
As soon as you identify someone
in charge, we'll come in.

17:03.911 --> 17:06.478
Detectives.
I got the lab results back

17:06.513 --> 17:09.448
on the chemical residue
I found in the stab wounds.

17:09.483 --> 17:11.083
It's polylactic acid.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.818
- Acid?
- Not the kind that burns.

17:12.853 --> 17:15.387
It's a thermoplastic
used in a variety of products ...

17:15.423 --> 17:19.358
surgical implants, disposable
forks and knives, drinking straws.

17:19.393 --> 17:21.226
I doubt she was stabbed with a straw.

17:21.262 --> 17:23.929
No, but that means the murder
weapon is made out of plastic.

17:23.964 --> 17:27.098
- Like a prop?
- Yeah, like something an actor would use.

17:27.134 --> 17:29.201
Maybe it'll be zombies.
That'd be cool.

17:29.236 --> 17:31.503
You're going undercover.
You're not going on vacation.

17:31.539 --> 17:36.975
- Yeah.  I sure hope it's not spiders.
- Spiders?

17:37.011 --> 17:38.444
Why would you say that?

17:38.479 --> 17:41.580
Well, uh, people find
spiders scary, that's all.

17:41.615 --> 17:43.916
I wouldn't be at all
surprised if it was spiders ...

17:43.951 --> 17:45.417
a big, ol' web with hundreds of 'em.

17:45.453 --> 17:47.852
- It's not gonna be spiders!
- You never know.

17:47.887 --> 17:49.922
- No spiders!
- Okay.

17:49.957 --> 17:52.891
Frankie, you're looking a little pale.

17:52.927 --> 17:54.426
Would you like me
to check your blood pressure,

17:54.462 --> 17:56.061
make sure everything's okay?

17:56.096 --> 17:58.897
No, I'm... I'm fine, Maura.

17:58.933 --> 18:02.401
[chuckles]
That's hilarious. "Spiders."

18:02.436 --> 18:04.803
[laughs]

18:06.940 --> 18:10.142
- I don't like to talk about it.
- I understand.

18:10.177 --> 18:12.211
But I could really use your help.

18:12.246 --> 18:15.080
There's nothing the
police can do anyway.

18:15.115 --> 18:17.916
At least, that's what they
told me when it happened.

18:17.952 --> 18:20.018
I'm sure they did their best.

18:20.054 --> 18:22.454
But maybe I can do more.

18:22.490 --> 18:24.223
[sighs]

18:24.258 --> 18:29.828
My accounts were hijacked.
My e-mail, all my texts.

18:29.864 --> 18:34.099
Every stupid thing I'd ever
written was made public.

18:34.134 --> 18:35.501
It was so embarrassing.

18:35.536 --> 18:36.969
We all write things in private

18:37.004 --> 18:38.904
we wouldn't want other people to read.

18:38.939 --> 18:41.373
Some of my friends
never talked to me again.

18:41.408 --> 18:43.075
And it didn't stop for months.

18:43.110 --> 18:46.011
Every time I got a new
account, it got hijacked.

18:46.046 --> 18:50.849
- Do you have any idea who was doing it?
- Yeah. I told the cops.

18:50.885 --> 18:52.951
But they said they
couldn't find any proof.

18:52.987 --> 18:55.320
Who did you think it was?

18:55.356 --> 18:59.825
This weird guy in my
public health class.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.895
He kept asking me out,
but I didn't want to go.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.197
I finally told him
to just leave me alone.

19:05.232 --> 19:07.366
He got so pissed.

19:07.401 --> 19:12.070
And then like a week later,
all my e-mails got released.

19:12.106 --> 19:16.074
- Remember his name?
- Riley.

19:16.110 --> 19:17.910
Riley Keating.

19:17.945 --> 19:21.780
All right.
I'm gonna find Riley,

19:21.815 --> 19:24.143
and I'm going to have a talk with him.

19:28.255 --> 19:30.489
Hi, Professor Sullivan.
This is Jane Rizzoli.

19:30.524 --> 19:32.291
Thank you for returning my call.

19:32.326 --> 19:35.861
Um, I would love to see
the townhouse tonight,

19:35.896 --> 19:38.530
and 7:00 should be fine.

19:38.566 --> 19:42.167
I'll be there, unless I hear
differently from you. [beep]

19:42.202 --> 19:46.838
<i>Okay ...
Seriously? Excuse me.</i>

19:46.874 --> 19:48.507
- Where did that little girl go?
- She just left.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.242
She's raising money to help blind kids.

19:50.277 --> 19:51.843
If you hurry, you might catch her,

19:51.879 --> 19:53.512
but I wouldn't count on
winning that Paris trip.

19:53.547 --> 19:57.414
I'm feeling pretty
good about my chances.

but she was tough.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.186
She... She'd been
through some hard times.

22:07.222 --> 22:09.422
She was killed at your event.
How could you not notice?

22:09.457 --> 22:11.057
I guess because she was downstairs

22:11.092 --> 22:12.425
with the kidnap/torture crew,

22:12.460 --> 22:15.128
and I was up on the roof
murdering those nuns.

22:15.163 --> 22:16.963
Sure. Makes perfect sense.

22:16.998 --> 22:18.931
When she didn't show up
at the end of the night,

22:18.967 --> 22:21.534
I looked through all the
rooms where she'd been working.

22:21.569 --> 22:24.237
They all looked empty.
I just figured she took off.

22:24.272 --> 22:28.107
- You didn't think to report her missing?
- Honestly, we all thought

22:28.143 --> 22:29.842
that she probably went off on a bender.

22:29.878 --> 22:31.477
- She was a heavy drinker?
- Used to be.

22:31.513 --> 22:33.513
She'd been sober about a year now,

22:33.548 --> 22:35.948
but she had fallen off the wagon before.

22:35.984 --> 22:37.583
What exactly was her role that night?

22:37.619 --> 22:40.186
She was, uh, one of
the sadistic kidnappers.

22:40.221 --> 22:42.555
She would make these terrifying threats,

22:42.590 --> 22:45.057
and then the buzz saw was really loud.

22:45.093 --> 22:46.893
So once people were good and scared,

22:46.928 --> 22:49.195
she would just leave
them alone for a while ...

22:49.230 --> 22:51.230
you know, really build up the fear.

22:51.266 --> 22:53.299
Sounds like you've got
it down to a science.

22:53.334 --> 22:54.967
More of an art.

22:55.003 --> 22:56.602
Were there any men playing
kidnappers that night?

22:56.638 --> 22:58.304
Two. Oh, but they're just

22:58.339 --> 23:00.173
acting students from
the Community College.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.542
- T-They wouldn't hurt Dani.
- Well, we'll need to talk to them.

23:02.577 --> 23:04.877
And all of the participants
from that night,

23:04.913 --> 23:08.114
especially the woman who was
blindfolded in that room with Dani.

23:08.149 --> 23:11.050
Sure. Uh, except I don't have
the names of any of the guests,

23:11.085 --> 23:14.253
o-only e-mail addresses.
You... You can have it all.

23:14.289 --> 23:17.737
Anything if it'll help you
figure out who did this.

23:19.123 --> 23:21.360
[music]

23:24.439 --> 23:27.039
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

23:27.075 --> 23:30.543
I have the perfect proposal idea.

23:30.578 --> 23:32.612
Oh, sorry.
Am I interrupting you?

23:32.647 --> 23:34.280
No. No, not at all.

23:34.315 --> 23:37.149
- Um, there's coffee.
- Thank you.

23:37.185 --> 23:42.221
So, I think Vince should
propose to Kiki on a gondola

23:42.256 --> 23:47.226
with italian music
and romance in the air.

23:47.261 --> 23:50.162
That's how I want to
be proposed to! [laughs]

23:50.198 --> 23:51.998
Where did Frank propose to you?

23:52.033 --> 23:54.700
In the parking lot at Sal Falucci's bar.

23:54.736 --> 23:56.702
- [laughing] Oh!
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

23:56.738 --> 24:01.148
- He was wearing his best suit.
- [laughing] Oh, that's good.

24:01.183 --> 24:03.609
[laughs]
Well, I think gondolas are lovely.

24:03.645 --> 24:07.380
But I am not sure that we can
decide how Korsak proposes.

24:07.415 --> 24:10.249
Yeah.

24:10.284 --> 24:13.252
So, uh, catching up on some reading?

24:13.287 --> 24:15.588
Yeah.
Some very interesting articles.

24:15.623 --> 24:17.356
How are you doing?

24:20.161 --> 24:23.162
- Are you sleeping any better?
- Mostly.

24:25.099 --> 24:27.066
Uh, don't worry. I'm... I'm fine.

24:27.101 --> 24:30.202
You went through hell.
Nobody expects you to be fine.

24:30.238 --> 24:31.671
Please don't say anything to Jane.

24:31.706 --> 24:35.675
- I-I don't want her worrying about me.
- Like you could ever stop her?

24:37.679 --> 24:42.581
But I, uh... I understand.

24:42.617 --> 24:45.688
You know how much
I care about you, Maura?

24:48.089 --> 24:51.657
- I do.
- So, how about you talk to me?

24:51.693 --> 24:53.559
[music]

24:56.931 --> 24:58.430
<i>We talked to all the actors</i>

24:58.466 --> 24:59.932
who were there the
night of the murder ...

24:59.967 --> 25:01.901
mostly college students,
none with any criminal record.

25:01.936 --> 25:05.237
"I'm not a murderer, I just
play one on the weekends"?

25:05.273 --> 25:07.172
We'll keep digging, but
nothing's jumping out.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.375
There was one guy that worked
in the basement with Dani,

25:09.410 --> 25:12.144
- but he's a size 9 shoe.
- So, that's not our guy.

25:12.179 --> 25:13.846
Nobody knew of any
problems she was having.

25:13.881 --> 25:16.415
No ex-boyfriends, no threats.

25:16.450 --> 25:19.385
Maybe Dani wasn't the target.
Maybe she was caught in the middle.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.186
I may have something.

25:21.222 --> 25:23.489
I ran all those e-mail addresses
you got from the Fear Club.

25:23.524 --> 25:25.157
I focused on all the entrance times

25:25.192 --> 25:27.159
that matched up to when
Dani Gibbs disappeared.

25:27.194 --> 25:30.229
- Okay, what'd you find?
- One of the addresses was connected

25:30.264 --> 25:32.431
to a restraining order that
was issued two months ago.

25:32.466 --> 25:34.166
- Assailant or victim?
- Victim.

25:34.201 --> 25:37.403
Her name's Karen Hughes.
She's the director of a local preschool.

25:37.438 --> 25:39.538
She filed against a former
employee, Gus Brooks.

25:39.573 --> 25:40.906
And what do we know about him?

25:40.942 --> 25:45.177
Brooks has two priors for assault,
both back in Philadelphia.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.780
- Got an address?
- Last known is back in Philly.

25:47.815 --> 25:50.416
But this is the preschool
that Karen Hughes runs.

25:50.451 --> 25:52.584
Okay. I'll grab Frankie,
and we'll go talk to her.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.720
We should talk to Philadelphia P.D.,

25:54.755 --> 25:56.789
have them do a drive-by,
see if he's still there.

25:56.824 --> 25:59.602
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay, thanks.

26:02.263 --> 26:04.196
I think I found the hacker.

26:04.231 --> 26:06.498
His name's Riley Keating,
and he's here in Boston.

26:06.534 --> 26:08.233
- You know where?
- Yeah.

26:11.672 --> 26:15.541
<i>I'll send some uniforms to pick him up.
[both speaking indistinctly]</i>

26:15.576 --> 26:17.176
[elevator bell dings]

26:25.419 --> 26:27.386
[school bell rings]

26:27.421 --> 26:31.190
[children chattering, laughing]

26:31.225 --> 26:34.760
We're investigating a homicide.
A woman died that night.

26:34.795 --> 26:37.730
Oh, my god.
It was real?

26:37.765 --> 26:39.765
[printer whirring]

26:39.800 --> 26:42.479
Is there a place where we could talk?

26:46.574 --> 26:49.775
I had never done
anything like that before.

26:49.810 --> 26:53.278
Honestly, my life here is
pretty boring most of the time.

26:53.314 --> 26:55.447
You would think with all
these kids running around,

26:55.483 --> 26:57.549
it'd be anything but boring.

26:57.585 --> 27:00.219
I've always loved that
rush of adrenaline ...

27:00.254 --> 27:02.788
you know, roller coasters, zip-lining.

27:02.823 --> 27:05.257
I thought the Fear Club
would be like that.

27:07.728 --> 27:10.662
That poor woman.
She saved my life.

27:10.698 --> 27:14.199
Can you tell us anything
about the man that stabbed her?

27:14.235 --> 27:17.636
He wore a mask,
like a scarecrow kind of thing.

27:17.671 --> 27:21.673
Do you know how tall he
was, skin color, anything?

27:21.709 --> 27:24.643
Uh, I only saw him from across
the room, and it was dark.

27:24.678 --> 27:27.346
Uh, he was taller than her, though.

27:27.381 --> 27:28.881
Uh, two months ago,

27:28.916 --> 27:32.518
you filed a restraining
order against a Gus Brooks?

27:32.553 --> 27:35.888
Yes. Uh, she worked
here for a few months,

27:35.923 --> 27:38.590
doing maintenance
and taking care of the grounds.

27:38.626 --> 27:41.393
But I discovered that he
lied on his application.

27:41.429 --> 27:42.861
What'd he lie about?

27:42.897 --> 27:45.931
His name, for starters.
I mean, we knew him as Jerry ...

27:45.966 --> 27:48.534
which I found out later was
actually his brother's name.

27:48.569 --> 27:50.836
He used that and his brother's
social security number

27:50.871 --> 27:54.273
to get the job. When I learned
that, I fired him immediately.

27:54.308 --> 27:56.809
- And he didn't take that well?
- He showed up here a few times,

27:56.844 --> 27:58.877
insisting he'd been doing a good job.

27:58.913 --> 28:01.580
He'd yell from the street,
frightening the children.

28:01.615 --> 28:03.449
- Has he been around lately?
- No.

28:03.484 --> 28:06.485
After I filed the restraining
order, we never saw him again.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.888
- Uh, he lives in Philadelphia now.
- How do you know that?

28:09.924 --> 28:15.861
He entered a residential treatment
facility for anger management.

28:15.896 --> 28:18.730
He sent me these letters
apologizing for his behavior.

28:18.766 --> 28:21.433
He says it's part of the program.

28:21.469 --> 28:25.304
- The postmark says Philadelphia.
- This one was sent a week ago.

28:25.339 --> 28:26.839
Uh, if it's all right with you,

28:26.874 --> 28:29.174
we'd like to put you
into protective custody.

28:29.210 --> 28:31.844
Well, I run the school.
I-I can't just leave.

28:31.879 --> 28:36.830
How about we leave an officer in a
squad car right out front? [music]

28:40.888 --> 28:43.622
Good job tracking him down, Holiday.

28:43.657 --> 28:46.191
Thanks.
[dog barking in distance]

28:46.227 --> 28:48.460
[sighs]
It felt good being out again.

28:48.496 --> 28:51.230
Hate to be the kind of guy that
says, "I told you so," but...

28:51.265 --> 28:55.167
[laughs] But you told me so.
And you were right.

28:55.202 --> 28:57.769
You know, I almost left the force once,

28:57.805 --> 28:59.471
right after my second divorce.

28:59.507 --> 29:01.306
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was so busy with the job,

29:01.342 --> 29:04.676
I didn't notice that my
wife and I had drifted apart.

29:04.712 --> 29:06.145
When she left, I blamed myself.

29:06.180 --> 29:10.282
I couldn't shake the guilt, for months.

29:10.317 --> 29:14.686
Then I finally realized
I can't change the past.

29:14.722 --> 29:17.422
Got to find a way to move forward.

29:17.458 --> 29:20.292
- It's not easy, though.
- No.

29:20.327 --> 29:22.895
But it gets a little better every day.

29:22.930 --> 29:25.464
- Can't ask for more than that.
- I suppose not.

29:25.499 --> 29:28.634
[engine rumbling]

29:29.036 --> 29:30.602
Is that him?

29:36.010 --> 29:38.277
That's him.

29:39.113 --> 29:41.113
[dog barking in distance]

29:47.688 --> 29:50.222
Riley Keating?
Boston P.D.

29:50.257 --> 29:53.696
Where are you going?
This party's just getting started.

30:04.238 --> 30:07.272
Hi.
You talk to Philly P.D. yet?

30:07.308 --> 30:09.942
Yeah. They talked to Gus
Brooks at his apartment.

30:09.977 --> 30:11.477
He swears he hasn't been back to Boston

30:11.512 --> 30:13.979
since Karen Hughes filed
the restraining order.

30:14.014 --> 30:15.280
He have an alibi?

30:15.316 --> 30:18.917
Not a good one ...
home alone, watching TV.

30:18.953 --> 30:20.886
But I also called the treatment center

30:20.921 --> 30:23.088
where he's been doing his
anger-management program.

30:23.124 --> 30:26.391
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not sure he's our guy.

30:26.427 --> 30:27.926
Let me guess ...

30:27.962 --> 30:30.896
model patient, making
remarkable progress?

30:30.931 --> 30:33.265
Uh, he's been showing up
three times a week

30:33.300 --> 30:35.367
to his court-mandated sessions.

30:35.402 --> 30:37.402
Uh, counselor confirmed
he's been doing great.

30:37.438 --> 30:39.938
Still, it's only a six-hour
drive from Philly to Boston.

30:39.974 --> 30:42.040
But if he's living there,
how would he even know

30:42.076 --> 30:44.143
that Karen was going to
the Fear Club that night?

30:44.178 --> 30:46.111
I don't know.

30:46.147 --> 30:48.313
We still need to talk to him.
Can you get an address?

30:48.349 --> 30:50.916
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

30:51.152 --> 30:54.319
I have no idea what you
guys are talking about.

30:57.024 --> 30:59.258
You set up the website
that contained this video.

30:59.293 --> 31:01.760
These people burned
down a detective's home.

31:01.796 --> 31:03.328
<i>I hope they were insured.</i>

31:03.364 --> 31:05.798
You also hacked into Detective
Rizzoli's bank account.

31:05.833 --> 31:07.299
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

31:07.334 --> 31:10.469
And I don't even know
this Detective Ratatouille.

31:10.504 --> 31:12.004
Rizzoli.

31:12.039 --> 31:13.906
[music]

31:18.846 --> 31:21.346
- You found the hacker.
- Nina and Korsak brought him in.

31:21.382 --> 31:22.514
He's not giving us anything, though.

31:22.550 --> 31:24.049
No connection to Joe Harris?

31:24.084 --> 31:26.318
No connection to your kidnapping at all.

31:26.353 --> 31:28.921
No connection to me. No
connection to Framingham prison.

31:28.956 --> 31:31.089
He's too young to be the
person behind all this.

31:31.125 --> 31:33.126
- I agree.
- Joe Harris was a psychiatrist

31:33.127 --> 31:35.127
used to working with convicts.

31:35.162 --> 31:37.462
When I heard him on the phone,
he was talking to someone

31:37.498 --> 31:40.799
he had a personal and
trusting relationship with.

31:40.835 --> 31:43.168
I don't believe he would have
used that tone with this kid.

31:43.204 --> 31:45.470
Yeah, so that means this guy
is just a keyboard for hire.

31:45.506 --> 31:47.372
Get comfortable.
You're not going anywhere.

31:47.408 --> 31:49.041
<i>Riley: You guys got nothing on me.</i>

31:49.076 --> 31:50.843
And I could probably actually sue you

31:50.878 --> 31:53.011
for, like, false "arrest-ment,"
or something like that.

31:53.047 --> 31:56.114
We may not be able to prove you
hacked Detective Rizzoli yet,

31:56.150 --> 31:57.816
but we didn't arrest you for that.

31:57.852 --> 31:59.585
<i>Three years ago,
you hacked into the accounts</i>

31:59.620 --> 32:01.587
of a young woman named
Megan Christenson,

32:01.622 --> 32:04.156
which is illegal.

32:04.191 --> 32:05.958
You weren't as good then as you are now.

32:05.993 --> 32:07.426
<i>You left traces,</i>

32:07.461 --> 32:09.561
<i>which we tracked back to
your personal accounts.</i>

32:11.565 --> 32:13.899
- That was no big deal.
- It was to Megan.

32:13.934 --> 32:16.669
And to the State of
Massachusetts, who shall be happy

32:16.670 --> 32:19.404
to give you 2 1/2 years
in the state penitentiary.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.207
Lucky for you, Megan and I
have a pretty good relationship.

32:22.243 --> 32:25.544
She's agreed not to press charges
as long as you cooperate.

32:28.849 --> 32:32.050
- I don't really know that much.
- Tell us what you do know.

32:32.086 --> 32:34.186
We'll find whoever's behind this.

32:34.221 --> 32:36.088
[music]

32:39.493 --> 32:42.261
I called him.
I-I saw the townhouse last night.

32:42.296 --> 32:43.528
You did?
Are you gonna take it?

32:43.564 --> 32:44.863
[sighs] I don't know.

32:44.899 --> 32:48.200
- I just... I-I'm unsure about...
- Jane.

32:48.235 --> 32:51.503
Uh, something weird just popped
up in the Fear Club e-mails.

32:51.538 --> 32:53.238
- What?
- I-I found a second invitation

32:53.274 --> 32:55.374
that was sent to Karen
Hughes's office computer,

32:55.409 --> 32:57.376
but it was sent
to a different e-mail address.

32:57.411 --> 32:59.444
Well, who else has
access to her computer?

32:59.480 --> 33:01.179
I called her.
She said no one.

33:01.215 --> 33:03.248
So somebody else at the school
got an invitation?

33:03.284 --> 33:05.284
[sighs]

33:05.319 --> 33:08.320
I saw one of those 3-D
printers in the classroom.

33:08.355 --> 33:10.455
The plastic that you
found in the wound ...

33:10.491 --> 33:12.357
could that come from a 3-D printer?

33:12.393 --> 33:15.327
Definitely. Uh, the polylactic
acid is biodegradable.

33:15.362 --> 33:18.830
Wait. You think that the killer
printed the murder weapon?

33:18.866 --> 33:20.532
It would get through a metal detector.

33:20.567 --> 33:22.834
And that would explain
why the blade was dull.

33:22.870 --> 33:26.338
3-D printers can't re-create
the honed edge of a knife.

33:26.373 --> 33:28.206
We got to talk to Karen.

33:28.242 --> 33:30.242
- Uh, do we still have a uniform
outside the school?  - Yeah.

33:30.277 --> 33:32.210
Okay, call him and ...
and tell him to find her.

33:32.246 --> 33:36.008
Stick with her until we get to her.
Bye, Maura. [elevator bell dings]

33:37.351 --> 33:39.017
- Maura!
- Kiki.

33:39.053 --> 33:41.954
- What a nice surprise.
- Surprise, yes. [chuckles]

33:41.989 --> 33:43.956
Uh, Vince and I are gonna
get something to eat.

33:43.991 --> 33:46.858
- Can you join?
- Oh, I really can't talk to you.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.927
[chuckling]
I mean I really can't talk.

33:48.963 --> 33:52.164
I can't talk to anyone about anything.

33:52.199 --> 33:54.499
Just busy.
Busy, busy, busy girl.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.368
Well, that's too bad.
Maybe some other time.

33:56.403 --> 33:57.536
- Yeah, love to.
- Oh. Oh.

33:57.571 --> 33:59.871
- Bye!
- Okay. Bye. Yeah.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.507
[sighs]

34:25.899 --> 34:27.399
[pounding on door]

34:33.007 --> 34:34.806
[sighs]

34:34.842 --> 34:36.942
Officer Ellis. Is everything okay?

34:36.976 --> 34:38.476
Yes, ma'am. Just a precaution.

34:38.512 --> 34:40.078
- Okay if I come in?
- Yeah.

34:40.114 --> 34:41.279
[cellphone rings]

34:41.315 --> 34:43.415
I imagine that's Detective Rizzoli.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.083
- She needed to talk to you.
- Hello?

34:46.120 --> 34:48.053
Hi, Karen. It's Jane Rizzoli.

34:48.088 --> 34:50.288
- Is everything all right, detective?
- I'm not sure.

34:50.324 --> 34:52.958
Um, i-if you could just sit
tight until we get there ...

34:52.993 --> 34:53.958
[Karen screams]

34:53.994 --> 34:56.828
Karen?
Go, go.

34:56.864 --> 34:58.830
[siren wails, tires squeal]

35:07.756 --> 35:09.489
[grunting]

35:12.894 --> 35:13.893
[yells]

35:15.731 --> 35:17.297
[grunts, yells]

35:31.546 --> 35:33.313
<i>Frankie: He's alive.</i>

36:13.655 --> 36:15.522
[sighs]

36:26.668 --> 36:28.568
[sighs]

36:28.603 --> 36:31.304
- [both whisper] Anything?
- No. You?

36:31.340 --> 36:32.772
No, nothing.

36:39.548 --> 36:40.780
Frankie, get down!

36:40.816 --> 36:42.315
[gunshot]

36:48.023 --> 36:50.924
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.959
[breathing shakily]

36:56.865 --> 36:59.265
[whimpering]

36:59.301 --> 37:01.801
<i>Okay. It's all right.</i>

37:01.837 --> 37:02.936
It's okay.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.305
It's over.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.841
Okay?
[crying]

37:07.876 --> 37:10.939
It's okay.
[sobbing]

37:11.780 --> 37:14.314
It's okay.

37:14.349 --> 37:15.882
[music]

37:15.917 --> 37:18.769
So, Gus Brooks was using
a plastic key that he made

37:18.770 --> 37:21.621
on the 3-D printer to break into
the school after he was fired.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.256
Looking for a way to get his revenge.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.925
- Fear Club was the perfect opportunity.
- Mm-hmm.

37:25.961 --> 37:29.262
And then Daniella Gibbs got in
the way and saved Karen's life.

37:29.297 --> 37:31.364
Hey, Jane, uh, you were right.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.299
There is something I've
been keeping from you.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.235
What? That you're gonna
ask Kiki to marry you?

37:35.270 --> 37:38.505
- How did you know that?
- I'm a detective. I know things.

37:38.540 --> 37:41.307
Uh, it... it's fine. I get it.
It's your life. It's ...

37:41.343 --> 37:43.443
No, no, no.
I wanted to tell you. I just...

37:43.478 --> 37:45.779
I thought talking about
my marriage proposal

37:45.814 --> 37:47.914
- was insensitive.
- Why?

37:47.949 --> 37:50.383
Why?
All the stuff that was going on ...

37:50.419 --> 37:52.819
Maura's kidnapping, the attacks on you.

37:52.854 --> 37:54.788
What... so, you're
worried about being happy?

37:54.823 --> 37:57.657
How are we supposed to get
through the shitty moments in life

37:57.692 --> 38:00.794
if we don't have the happy
ones to balance them out?

38:00.829 --> 38:03.296
- So you're okay with it?
- Yeah.

38:03.331 --> 38:06.599
I'm more than okay with it.
I'm thrilled. [cellphone buzzes]

38:06.635 --> 38:08.201
Okay?
[beep]

38:08.236 --> 38:11.471
- Hmm.
- Where you going?

38:11.506 --> 38:14.607
I got one more case to solve today.

38:14.643 --> 38:16.776
Yeah, it's for a really good cause.

38:16.812 --> 38:20.820
- Mm. All right, well, I'll take 100.
- A 100? Really?

38:20.855 --> 38:22.749
The orphans are gonna be so excited.

38:22.784 --> 38:26.753
Mm-hmm.
So excited.

38:26.788 --> 38:31.825
You know, I think the only kid
benefiting from this... is you.

38:31.860 --> 38:35.528
Don't lie. I'm a cop.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.531
- I just wanted a puppy.
- A puppy?

38:38.567 --> 38:41.234
My Mom said no, so I decided
to raise the money myself.

38:41.269 --> 38:42.669
Well, honey, if your mom said no,

38:42.704 --> 38:45.805
- then you can't have a puppy.
- But it's not fair.

38:45.841 --> 38:48.942
Okay, well, maybe if you spent
more time convincing your mom

38:48.977 --> 38:52.779
and less time swindling people,
you might get what you want.

38:52.814 --> 38:55.882
- You really think so?
- I think it's worth a try.

38:55.917 --> 38:59.452
Because this is over.

38:59.488 --> 39:02.806
- T-There's my mom.
- Wha...?

39:03.492 --> 39:06.526
- You're Cynthia's kid?
- Here, I'll make you a deal.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.628
I'll give all the money I raised
to the boys and girls club,

39:08.663 --> 39:11.409
- and you don't tell my mom.
- I'll make you a deal.

39:11.444 --> 39:13.806
You give me all the money
you made, I'll give it

39:13.807 --> 39:16.169
to the boys and girls club,
and I may not tell your mom.

39:16.204 --> 39:18.429
Deal. Thanks.

39:18.607 --> 39:21.608
Do you really think I can talk
my mom into getting me a puppy?

39:21.643 --> 39:24.751
I think you can do anything
you set your mind to.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.714
[chuckles]

39:27.749 --> 39:31.317
You know, she reminds me of you
when you were that age.

39:31.353 --> 39:32.585
A thief?!

39:32.621 --> 39:35.938
Cop, thief ...
it could have gone either way.

39:36.892 --> 39:40.527
- Just saying.
- Well, smart kid.

39:40.562 --> 39:44.058
[music]

39:44.499 --> 39:47.267
Come on, Vince.
Who doesn't love a gondola?

39:47.302 --> 39:49.802
Ma, she could get seasick.
You never know.

39:49.838 --> 39:51.471
- Does she?
- I-I don't know.

39:51.506 --> 39:53.706
You know what you should do?
You should propose to her

39:53.742 --> 39:56.876
at Fenway Park when
the Sox are playing, you know?

39:56.912 --> 39:59.712
And... And they put it on the
big jumbotron on the big screen?

39:59.748 --> 40:03.683
Wait. You want him to propose
over a hot dog and beer?

40:03.718 --> 40:05.318
Perfect, isn't it?
[laughter]

40:05.353 --> 40:08.855
A proposal deserves champagne
and a string quartet.

40:08.890 --> 40:11.257
I always thought getting
engaged in a hot-air balloon

40:11.293 --> 40:17.267
- sounded like fun.
- Or maybe you could just ask her.

40:17.465 --> 40:20.466
- Longfellow Bridge... very romantic.
- Yeah.

40:20.502 --> 40:23.603
There's always the top of the hub.
Unbelievable views.

40:23.638 --> 40:27.240
- What about a flash mob?
- I love those. [laughter]

40:27.275 --> 40:29.776
Oh! You know what he should do?
He should write her a song.

40:29.811 --> 40:33.187
You should write her a ...
Where'd he go? [gasps]

40:34.282 --> 40:37.417
Ye... [gasping]

40:37.452 --> 40:39.586
- Huh?
- Yes, of course! Yes!

40:39.621 --> 40:41.421
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

40:41.456 --> 40:45.058
- She said yes!
- Yay! [laughter]

40:45.059 --> 40:47.999
[all cheering]

40:51.666 --> 40:53.967
<i>Whoo!</i>

40:54.002 --> 40:57.337
<i>Oh, how sweet!</i>

40:57.372 --> 40:59.872
- I love new beginnings.
- Mm. Aw.

40:59.908 --> 41:02.508
I... oh, speaking of,
I took the townhouse.

41:02.619 --> 41:04.181
- [gasps] You did?!
- Yeah.

41:04.215 --> 41:05.349
- Yay!
- Yay.

41:05.383 --> 41:08.385
- Yes!
- Wait, you're moving out?

41:08.419 --> 41:10.020
Yeah.
First of the month.

41:10.054 --> 41:12.956
Oh! Drinks are on me!
[Laughter]

41:12.991 --> 41:16.159
Here's to the future
Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Korsak! Yes.

41:16.194 --> 41:17.227
[All cheering]

41:17.261 --> 41:20.297
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

41:20.331 --> 41:22.399

- Whoo-hoo!</i>

41:22.433 --> 41:24.901
