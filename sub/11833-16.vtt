WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.537
Can you draft up a motion
to compel on Peters?

00:03.570 --> 00:05.438
Documents?
JIMMY: Yeah.

00:05.471 --> 00:07.808
LINDSAY: Bobby, you ready?
Ready?

00:07.841 --> 00:10.343
To go to the printers
for the invitations?

00:10.376 --> 00:13.113
Oh, God, I completely forgot.
I got the Strauss depo at 10:00.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.115
Discovery's over on Peters?
But we still don't have
the medicals.

00:15.148 --> 00:16.482
ELLENOR: Strauss?
That jerk?
You promised.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.451
That client. I'm sorry.

00:18.484 --> 00:20.621
You should move for sanctions--
You scheduled this
depo intentionally.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.488
I didn't. At least try.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.157
Can you at least look?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.460
Parchment with black ink
or white with embossing?
Yes on sanctions, Bobby?

00:27.493 --> 00:29.062
Uh, yes.
The embossing is nice.

00:29.095 --> 00:30.096
I didn't ask you.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.567
Bobby, you're gonna be late.
Here's Strauss's address.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.236
Bobby?
Uh, white
with the gold border.

00:36.269 --> 00:38.171
That wasn't
one of the choices.
You asked my opinion.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.040
Doesn't mean
she wanted it.
White with the gold.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.342
He didn't even look.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.078
They never
give you sanctions.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.246
You ever get sanctions?

00:49.182 --> 00:50.350
(alarm chirps)

00:55.321 --> 00:57.257
Here's the keys.
That ain't gonna do it.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.125
Here's a wallet.
That ain't gonna
do it, either.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.761
(groans)

01:06.499 --> 01:08.802
Maybe you didn't
see the gun, huh?

01:08.835 --> 01:12.438
Take my watch,
ATM card, whatever--

01:12.472 --> 01:14.307
whatever you want.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.442
I want you, Bobby Donnell.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.478
I came for you.

01:18.812 --> 01:22.115
(music playing)

02:07.628 --> 02:08.628
Over there.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.699
Look, pal,
I don't know what you want--

02:12.733 --> 02:13.900
Sit down.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.870
Sit your ass down!

02:17.838 --> 02:19.673
Do me a favor, too, okay?

02:19.706 --> 02:21.675
Don't call me pal.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.845
I want you to call me
Mr. Rooney. Okay?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.647
Ain't that what the judge
called me, huh?

02:26.680 --> 02:27.781
Mr. Rooney?

02:27.814 --> 02:30.283
Right before he dumped my ass
in the hole for 12 years?

02:31.417 --> 02:32.919
Rooney?
Yeah.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.355
Rooney.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.257
Patrick Rooney.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.359
Your old client.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.461
When?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.431
1988. Braintree.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.700
Double homicide.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.670
I didn't think
you'd remember.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.540
I got you a deal,
didn't I?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.643
Yeah. You got rid of me.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.579
That's what you did.
What are you
talking about?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.180
Shut up!

03:01.882 --> 03:03.449
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.618
Rooney.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.420
What-- You had a trial.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.557
Some trial. You were
really good there, too.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.392
You sat there.
You heard the evidence.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.294
You said yourself
the jury was going to convict.

03:14.327 --> 03:15.495
I didn't force you
to take any deal.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.830
What are you talking about?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.499
You told me
it was that or life!

03:22.569 --> 03:25.238
So I did 12 years for killings
that I didn't do.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.215
It's judgment day now, Bob.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.552
Now you're on trial.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.494
I really hope I ordered
enough invitations.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.330
Two hundred and fifty.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.899
Lindsay, it's a wedding,
not a Celtics game.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.901
I really don't think
you should rush her.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.402
Excuse me?

03:56.436 --> 03:58.471
If you're not here
to be helpful...

03:58.505 --> 03:59.940
You know,
maybe you should pretend

03:59.973 --> 04:01.675
like you have
another customer.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.710
Aren't you the witch.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.811
How many came
to your wedding?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.046
I'm not married.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.681
Big surprise.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.351
That's weird.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.653
Hey, has anyone
seen Bobby?

04:12.686 --> 04:15.288
He hasn't shown up yet
for the deposition.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.290
Well, maybe he got caught
in traffic.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.858
He left
over an hour ago,

04:18.892 --> 04:20.661
and he was only going
to Medford.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.437
You want to tell me
what your problem is or what?

04:31.471 --> 04:32.973
You're my problem.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.908
That much I gather.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.377
Maybe you could be
more specific.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.547
It would be poor judgment
for you to get smug right now.

04:42.749 --> 04:43.884
All right, look.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.387
I'm sorry if you felt
you didn't get a fair shake.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.056
It happens sometimes.
It's not a perfect system.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.926
I got news for you.
It wasn't the system.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.528
It was you.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.862
You may want
to think that, but--

04:55.896 --> 04:58.064
Hey, I just wanted
to take the stand

04:58.098 --> 04:59.933
and tell my side
of the story,

04:59.966 --> 05:02.335
but you--
you wouldn't let me.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.771
I did that to protect you.
To protect me?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.840
Yes. You had a list
of priors.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.709
Doesn't mean
I killed anyone.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.677
You take the stand,
the priors come in.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.946
I wasn't on trial
for my priors!

05:12.979 --> 05:13.947
That wouldn't have mattered
to the jury.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.115
They just would've
concluded that--

05:15.148 --> 05:16.950
The jury should have
heard me say

05:16.983 --> 05:18.418
that I didn't kill anybody!

05:18.451 --> 05:21.855
Instead, I sat there
with my mouth shut

05:21.888 --> 05:23.690
on your advice.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.359
And they made
their own conclusions,

05:26.392 --> 05:27.594
didn't they, counsel?

05:36.469 --> 05:38.739
You know
what really bothers me?

05:38.772 --> 05:40.907
You know what's really
been eating at me?

05:42.475 --> 05:43.677
You.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.582
You never even asked to hear
my side of the story.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.817
You didn't even want
to listen.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.753
There's a reason
for that.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.589
Whatever you tell me
as a client, I'm stuck with it.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.924
If I know you're about
to lie on the stand,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.926
I have a duty to go
to the judge and tell him.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.828
It's better
in some situations

06:01.862 --> 06:04.130
for the lawyer
not to hear what happened.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.833
Assuming that I
would be lying,

06:06.867 --> 06:08.702
which I wasn't.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.704
I was gonna tell the truth,

06:10.737 --> 06:13.373
but you refused
to believe me.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.076
Okay, Patrick.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.412
Okay.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.584
Tell me the story.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.859
I stayed in the car
that night.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.961
Mickey went inside.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.766
I had no idea what he
was gonna do.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.902
I only drove him
to his ex's

06:41.935 --> 06:44.104
because he said he had to
get some things back from her.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.972
He told me he was
going to talk to her,

06:46.006 --> 06:49.075
it would just take
a few minutes, so I waited.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.712
(gunshots)
All of a sudden
I heard shots going off.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.082
I didn't even know Mickey
had a piece on him that night.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.184
But you ran.
I freaked!

06:58.218 --> 07:01.522
I turned around, I seen Mickey
come out covered in blood.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.857
I couldn't have
any part of that,
so I took off, okay?

07:05.491 --> 07:07.728
Even if that were true,
we had no way of proving it.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.195
Mickey didn't live
long enough to back you.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.864
Because the police
killed him.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.633
As I recall,
they found your jacket

07:12.666 --> 07:14.200
next to the bodies with
the mother's blood all over it.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.802
Mickey borrowed my coat!

07:17.003 --> 07:18.939
I'm telling you,
I stayed in the car!

07:18.972 --> 07:21.041
Okay, okay, Patrick,
I believe you.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.843
I believe you.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.512
Uhh! (groans)

07:25.546 --> 07:28.615
Don't play with me!
You never believed me!

07:31.151 --> 07:33.854
(cell phone ringing)

07:36.590 --> 07:38.224
REBECCA: Bobby?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.060
Bobby, are you there?

07:40.727 --> 07:41.995
Bobby?

07:43.597 --> 07:44.798
Bobby?

07:46.933 --> 07:48.034
Bobby.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.172
EUGENE: What?

07:52.205 --> 07:54.708
I think he answered,
but then it went dead.

07:54.741 --> 07:55.742
It probably
didn't go through.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.244
No, no.
Somebody answered.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.118
All right.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.556
This is wrong.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.925
It's not
"Mr. and Mrs. Robert Donnell."

08:11.958 --> 08:14.027
It's supposed to read
"Ms. Lindsay Dole

08:14.060 --> 08:15.529
and Mr. Robert Donnell"
on the envelopes.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.297
Hmm.
what?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.733
You're sublimating.
I'm what?

08:19.766 --> 08:21.735
You're taking it out
on the envelopes.
It's very common.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.304
Things will go a lot smoother
with your second marriage.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.940
I heat my pool
on repeat business.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.809
People actually
come back to you?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.310
You're hurtful.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.645
And you wonder why you can't
latch on to a husband.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.216
(cell phone rings)

08:36.249 --> 08:39.085
Is that you or me?
Drug dealers.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
Got it. Yeah?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.889
No, I haven't heard
from him.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.692
Did you try
his cell phone?

08:47.728 --> 08:50.864
That's strange.
Okay, I'm on my way.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.033
What is it?
Bobby never showed up
at his deposition,

08:53.066 --> 08:54.735
and no one's
heard from him.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.971
You're breathing
pretty heavy, counsel.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.305
What's the matter,
you scared?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.574
Isn't that what you want?

09:03.143 --> 09:05.646
I'd just hate to see
this gun go off by accident.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.016
That would be ironic,
wouldn't it?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.352
See, I'm having a hard time
living with your mistake,

09:12.385 --> 09:15.321
and you certainly
couldn't live with mine.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.190
Patrick, however
angry you are,

09:17.223 --> 09:18.859
you're free now.
You're out.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.193
Why throw that all away?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.963
Hey, it was all
thrown away the day

09:22.996 --> 09:25.599
that you were assigned
to me.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.000
Fine. So now what,
you're going to kill me

09:27.033 --> 09:28.835
and go back to prison?
Your life will be over.

09:28.869 --> 09:32.372
Let me tell you
something, Bobby!

09:32.405 --> 09:35.776
The only thing that's
kept me going is hate.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.646
Knowing that if I just
stuck it out,

09:39.680 --> 09:44.084
that I would get
the chance to have this
very moment right here.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.987
That's the only thing
I've had to cling to
for the past 12 years.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.926
Now, that might not seem
like much to most people,

09:52.959 --> 09:56.096
but for me,
to have the chance
to kill you...

09:58.298 --> 10:01.702
If that were it,
you would have done it.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.369
Oh, it'll happen.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.339
But first you're gonna
face the facts,

10:06.372 --> 10:08.341
the facts
that could have cleared me,

10:08.374 --> 10:10.611
the facts that you ignored.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.847
And then I'll kill you.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.988
Nobody at all?
He's about 6'1",
dark brown hair...

10:22.022 --> 10:23.156
Maybe a guy
with a head injury,
an amnesia thing.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.425
Yes, Donnell
is the last name.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.427
Yeah, sure,
I'll hold again.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.664
Nothing from Mass General.
Ditto at Tufts New England.

10:30.697 --> 10:34.167
And they're still saying
his cell phone is out of range
or not turned on.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.736
Any news?
Nothing.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.137
He hasn't shown up
at a hospital.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.139
You call the police?
Not yet.
Why not?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.274
Lindsay, I'm on it.
Get McGuire.
I'll talk to him.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.343
LUCY: Excuse me
one second, okay?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.779
Lindsay, I'm on the phone with
Bobby's credit card company.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.914
They're saying something
about him buying
electronics equipment--

10:47.948 --> 10:49.783
DVD player, wide-screen TV.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.285
Hello, this is Lindsay Dole.
I'm Mr. Donnell's fiancee.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.220
Is the person using
Mr. Donnell's credit card

10:54.254 --> 10:55.421
still at the electronics store?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.758
Then get them
to hold him.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.293
What do you mean you can't?
He's got his card--

11:01.728 --> 11:03.329
Look, this is Helen Gamble

11:03.363 --> 11:05.799
of the Suffolk County
District Attorney's office.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.400
I need you to talk
to your manager.

11:07.433 --> 11:11.838
Tell him to have security
hold the man until the police--

11:11.872 --> 11:13.339
I don't care
what your policy is.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
Do what I say,
or I will charge you

11:15.408 --> 11:17.811
with obstruction
of justice.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.680
Give me the number
of the store.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.184
You know,
I can still remember

11:24.217 --> 11:27.688
the first time you came
to see me in the lockup.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.257
You walked in real sharp.

11:31.291 --> 11:35.729
I figured, "Great. Some big
Harvard-type attorney.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.064
No problem."

11:39.365 --> 11:41.735
Did you go to Harvard, Bobby?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.872
Hey! I asked you a question.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.777
I went to Suffolk.
Suffolk?

11:50.811 --> 11:53.113
That's a racetrack.
What the hell
do you want from me?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.414
I've been sitting here
for three hours--

11:54.447 --> 11:56.850
You son of a bitch!
I'd kill you right now

11:56.883 --> 11:59.019
if I wasn't...

11:59.052 --> 12:01.988
What?
If you weren't what?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.456
You just shut up.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.225
Just shut your face
and sit there!

12:05.258 --> 12:06.827
You'll see what.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.433
I told you, I told you,
and I told you.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.769
I lifted the cards
from the guy's wallet.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.403
It was just laying there.
Lying where?

12:17.437 --> 12:20.373
Is this some kind of trick?
I already said!

12:20.406 --> 12:22.275
Then tell us again,
Mr. Franco.

12:22.308 --> 12:26.179
In the parking structure
on the ground, second level.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.048
And you didn't
roll the guy?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.816
You never saw
Mr. Donnell at all?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.317
Come on, Detective.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.186
You got my record
right there in front of you.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.789
I boost and fence.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.357
Sometimes I kite
a few checks,

12:37.390 --> 12:39.526
but I don't break heads.

12:40.561 --> 12:42.829
I just took
the guy's cards.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.883
You don't live here,
do you?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.384
Yeah, I do.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.953
Having trouble
walking lately?

13:12.358 --> 13:14.294
That's my grandfather's.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.429
Does he know
what you're doing here?

13:16.462 --> 13:20.534
No. He died the week
before I got out of jail.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.103
Were you two close?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.205
Are we bonding now?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.341
(clattering)

13:32.245 --> 13:33.880
You stay right there.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.015
I got nothing to lose.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.483
(groans)

14:12.052 --> 14:13.219
Nothing.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.672
Don't be jumping
to any conclusions.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.373
This can be
very misleading.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.408
Helen, we've been
to crime scenes before.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.619
You sure you want
to be here?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.621
I can take you back
to the office.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.656
No. I'll be all right.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.063
HELEN: What do you got?
MCGUIRE: Not much.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.332
Carjacking?
Possible, but most
of those guys

14:59.365 --> 15:01.134
total the vehicle
before they kick it back.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.435
And looking at the blood
on the hood--

15:02.468 --> 15:04.705
I know, but I want the facts
before I go there.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.340
We'll do a typing.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.710
Mike.
Hey, Eugene. Lindsay.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.477
Do you have
any witnesses?

15:11.512 --> 15:12.946
We're talking
to people now,

15:12.979 --> 15:14.480
but I want to be
realistic.

15:14.515 --> 15:15.949
Meaning what exactly?

15:15.982 --> 15:17.350
They're not big
on neighborhood watch

15:17.383 --> 15:18.952
in this part of town.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.721
Most of the guys down here,
they see a uniform,

15:20.754 --> 15:22.388
they think it's coming
for them.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.124
Do what you have to do
to get answers.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.126
I'll look the other way
if I have to.

15:33.634 --> 15:36.236
PATRICK: Sit right there.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.505
What's going on, Patrick?
Who is he?

15:38.539 --> 15:40.741
You want to know
who he is?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.610
Tell him who you are.
Please, I don't know
what this is all about.

15:43.644 --> 15:45.445
Tell him!

15:45.478 --> 15:48.181
Seymour Sternbach.
Look, if I did something--

15:48.214 --> 15:49.449
That's enough.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.518
I don't get it, Patrick.
What's going on?

15:51.552 --> 15:54.454
Seymour Sternbach.

15:54.487 --> 15:58.158
What, that doesn't ring
any bells to you, counsel?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.095
This is
my exculpatory witness.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.697
Your what?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.666
The man
who could have cleared me!

16:05.699 --> 16:08.468
The man that you said
you couldn't find.

16:08.502 --> 16:10.036
The man that I found

16:10.070 --> 16:12.472
three days
after I got out of prison!

16:14.508 --> 16:17.243
The man you never
even bothered to look for.

16:21.582 --> 16:24.350
Kidnapped?
Yeah, that's what
they think.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.486
By who?
They haven't figured
that part out yet.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.755
Random, or do they think
he was the target?

16:28.789 --> 16:30.190
I don't know.
Could be either.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.125
They really just don't know
very much.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.560
Kidnapped?

16:33.594 --> 16:36.730
So, what, they expect us
to get a ransom call?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.298
Kidnapped for money?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.267
I don't know.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.405
I swear,
I don't remember.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.774
You're lying.
You remember!
I don't!

16:48.775 --> 16:50.744
You were there, Seymour.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.580
In a car driving by?
Who would remember?

16:56.717 --> 16:58.351
I remember.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.587
We talked that night.

17:00.621 --> 17:04.190
Yeah, you and me,
we spoke.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.193
You were looking
for a parking space,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.663
and I flagged you down.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.832
You looking for a parking spot?
I told you
I'd just be a minute.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.400
Yeah. You leaving?
I was only waiting
for my buddy.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.336
Yeah, in about five minutes.
And then we talked
about your red mustang.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.271
Nice car, man.
1970.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.339
That's nice, man.
Then you saw
another space open up,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.608
Thanks anyway.
So you took that one instead.

17:22.643 --> 17:24.678
Look, who's going to remember
a two-minute conversation

17:24.711 --> 17:26.613
over a parking space
12 years ago?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.414
It was all over the news!

17:28.448 --> 17:31.217
The very next day,
a double homicide

17:31.251 --> 17:33.119
right where you were,
and you're gonna

17:33.153 --> 17:34.320
sit here and tell me
that you don't remember?

17:34.354 --> 17:36.456
I don't. Uhh!

17:36.489 --> 17:38.592
Patrick!
Don't lie to me!

17:38.625 --> 17:40.727
Don't you lie to me!
Patrick, you're gonna
kill him!

17:40.761 --> 17:42.696
Tell the truth!
Tell the truth!

17:42.729 --> 17:44.397
(screaming) All right!

17:50.771 --> 17:52.272
Tell him.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.545
I was there.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.414
You remember
talking to him?

18:01.882 --> 18:03.249
Yes.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.587
The night of the murder?

18:06.620 --> 18:08.354
Why didn't you
come forward?

18:08.388 --> 18:09.556
I was...

18:11.324 --> 18:14.494
look, I'm a married man.
I met a girl.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.430
If I'd come forward,
things would've--
Hey, hey.

18:19.633 --> 18:21.301
I did 12 years.

18:23.637 --> 18:26.406
You let me do 12 years because
you were cheating on your wife?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.710
Hey, for all I know,
you could've killed
those people after we talked.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.245
Patrick!

18:34.581 --> 18:37.350
And you--
you should have found him.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.252
Even if we had found him,
he doesn't get you off at all.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.188
Yes, he does!
No, he just confirms
you were at the scene

18:42.222 --> 18:44.891
ready to drive the getaway car.
That's all the jury needs--

18:44.925 --> 18:47.928
Only if I knew!
I told you I had no idea

18:47.961 --> 18:49.663
what the hell
Mickey was gonna do.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.766
Even so!
Intent, counsel.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.702
Intent. Look it up.

18:55.736 --> 18:57.337
I did.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.805
Mens reus.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.508
If I didn't know
what he was gonna do--

19:01.542 --> 19:03.376
But you helped him
get away!

19:03.409 --> 19:04.778
He never got in the car!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.279
Still, it was only
your word!

19:06.312 --> 19:07.881
Why would I
flag a guy down

19:07.914 --> 19:09.783
if I was there
to commit a crime?

19:14.688 --> 19:16.823
Never thought about that,
did you, counsel?

19:25.431 --> 19:27.367
See that look
on your face?

19:30.303 --> 19:32.172
That's the look
of a guilty man.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.653
What about previous threats?

19:46.687 --> 19:49.289
Did Bobby have any recent
run-ins with clients

19:49.322 --> 19:51.324
or witnesses
that might have a vendetta?

19:52.458 --> 19:53.894
We usually win.

19:53.927 --> 19:57.564
No threats? No client
you've screwed over?

19:58.732 --> 20:01.868
What? I didn't screw
anybody over.

20:01.902 --> 20:03.937
We may have a break--
EUGENE: What?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.506
A match on the prints
from Bobby's car.

20:05.539 --> 20:08.542
Name's Rooney.
Patrick Kevin Rooney.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.844
Patrick Rooney--
I think we had a client

20:10.877 --> 20:12.546
with that name,
but that was
a long time ago.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.715
Makes sense. He just finished
12 years at Cedar Junction.

20:14.748 --> 20:16.583
A manslaughter deal--
I remember it

20:16.617 --> 20:18.785
'cause I had
just started working here.
I think he's from Southie.

20:18.819 --> 20:20.353
We're going over
his full history now,

20:20.386 --> 20:22.255
but we'll need
whatever you still have.

20:27.027 --> 20:29.362
Okay.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.297
Okay, maybe I should
have found him.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.799
You screwed up.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.601
You screwed up.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.469
And if I did?

20:38.004 --> 20:40.340
It's too late
to change the past.

20:41.642 --> 20:43.544
You want me to try
to get the record expunged?

20:43.577 --> 20:45.478
Hey, you know
what got expunged?

20:45.512 --> 20:47.480
12 years of my life.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.516
Enough about the 12 years.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.718
I've heard about the 12 years.

20:51.752 --> 20:53.587
What about the ten years
before that,

20:53.620 --> 20:55.856
when you were out committing
aggravated assault

20:55.889 --> 20:58.792
and knocking off liquor stores?
The ten years before that!

21:00.493 --> 21:02.629
That's the reason I didn't
put you in the witness chair,

21:02.663 --> 21:04.965
the ten years before that.

21:04.998 --> 21:08.569
Was the reason that you
assumed that I was guilty.

21:08.602 --> 21:12.038
Maybe it was, and I'm
to blame, but so are you.

21:12.072 --> 21:14.440
Who you were
went into my thinking.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.643
What you were.

21:16.677 --> 21:19.279
You have to take some kind
of responsibility for that.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.748
(knock on door)

21:25.118 --> 21:28.522
You sit tight.
Don't try anything cute.

21:37.598 --> 21:38.865
Hey.

21:38.899 --> 21:41.001
Okay, you got
five minutes.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.036
Why don't you
come inside?

21:43.069 --> 21:44.671
I'm serious, Patrick.

21:44.705 --> 21:46.573
I told you on the phone,
I've got nothing else to say.

21:46.607 --> 21:47.808
I know. I got
to show you something.

21:47.841 --> 21:49.510
What the--

21:49.543 --> 21:51.077
Hey.
No, no, no.

21:51.111 --> 21:51.978
Patrick!

21:55.682 --> 21:59.085
Listen, I'm sorry,
but I can't let you leave.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.453
Patrick...

22:00.486 --> 22:02.088
Come on. Come on.

22:02.956 --> 22:05.058
Oh, my God.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.928
Come on, Suzie.
Patrick, no.

22:07.961 --> 22:09.796
Come on. Sit down.

22:10.664 --> 22:11.798
Right here.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.967
Patrick, please.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.669
Sit. Sit down.

22:22.976 --> 22:24.911
Listen. Hey.

22:24.945 --> 22:27.981
Look, I didn't want you
to see me like this
the first time.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.818
But I don't have
any choice now.

22:31.852 --> 22:34.588
What are you
talking about?

22:34.621 --> 22:35.889
I had to make you see.

22:36.990 --> 22:40.093
Because of them,
I lost you.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.429
I lost everything.
What?

22:43.463 --> 22:46.066
They'll tell you
I was innocent.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.701
You tell her
what happened.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.670
He's-- he's innocent.

22:53.139 --> 22:56.877
Patrick,
why are you doing this?

22:56.910 --> 23:00.480
Suzie, please, I'm not gonna
hurt you. I promise.

23:00.514 --> 23:03.149
I just-- I just--
stay right here, okay?

23:03.183 --> 23:05.519
Relax, okay?

23:05.552 --> 23:07.588
I'm gonna get you
something to drink.

23:07.621 --> 23:09.122
I'll get you some tonic,
all right? You want chips?

23:09.155 --> 23:12.058
You've got two men
at gunpoint,

23:12.092 --> 23:13.560
and you're
offering me chips?

23:13.594 --> 23:15.762
Come on, Patrick.
Leave her out of this.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.499
Leave her out of it?

23:21.768 --> 23:23.103
Leave her out of this?

23:23.136 --> 23:25.572
She is the reason
you're here right now,

23:25.606 --> 23:27.841
and she is the only reason
that you're still alive.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.142
You understand me?

23:34.214 --> 23:36.016
It has to be here.

23:36.049 --> 23:37.951
Nice filing system
you had, Bec.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.587
You know, I don't see
any dates on these folders.

23:40.621 --> 23:42.889
LINDSAY: Keep looking.
What exactly
are we looking for again?

23:42.923 --> 23:45.491
Court docs, work product,
a list of personal contacts,

23:45.526 --> 23:47.193
anybody or anything
that can help us.

23:47.227 --> 23:49.763
We're gonna be here
all night.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.132
I don't know why we're so
shocked this happened.
The people we have as clients?

23:52.165 --> 23:54.134
EUGENE: All right, Ellenor.
No, I'm serious, Eugene.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.571
Clients always blame their
lawyers, even in civil cases.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.906
Our clients are murderers
half the time going in.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.175
The bigger surprise is that
this doesn't happen more often.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.650
I don't think
she needed to hear that.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.792
I am sure he is okay.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.827
You can't
be sure of that.

24:20.861 --> 24:22.663
I mean,
who are we kidding?

24:25.231 --> 24:29.202
If this
was a revenge thing,

24:29.235 --> 24:32.072
the likelihood is he's dead.

24:32.105 --> 24:34.240
We both know it.
We don't know anything.

24:34.274 --> 24:36.543
This doesn't fit
any sort of typical--

24:36.577 --> 24:38.078
We haven't
heard from him.

24:38.111 --> 24:39.780
I mean, this Rooney guy?

24:39.813 --> 24:41.982
I mean, why would
he be taking him hostage?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.955
We both know
the statistics, Helen,

24:48.989 --> 24:50.991
and the longer
he's missing...

24:51.024 --> 24:53.994
We'll find him.
(breath shaking)

24:54.027 --> 24:57.030
I-I don't-- I don't--
I don't know if I can
handle this, Helen.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.003
We'll find him.
REBECCA: Got it!

25:09.075 --> 25:11.277
Rooney had us send a copy
of his appellate papers

25:11.311 --> 25:13.179
to his grandfather,
Seamus Rooney.

25:13.213 --> 25:14.948
The address
is right there.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.683
All right,
let's call McGuire.

25:18.619 --> 25:21.154
I have two cars in the area now
and two backups on their way.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.289
No one makes a move until
we get there. Understood?

25:23.323 --> 25:24.925
Helen, I'm going with you.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.760
EUGENE: We're all going.
(elevator dings)

25:26.793 --> 25:28.261
Let's just go.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.669
You want a drink, Suzie?

25:40.841 --> 25:43.009
(chuckles) I got it.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.145
I thought you knew.

25:51.618 --> 25:52.853
Who was I kidding, huh?

25:54.755 --> 25:57.758
Twelve years, you don't
come to see me once.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.662
I should have
figured it out, huh?

26:03.363 --> 26:04.931
I loved you, Patrick.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.936
What kind of a future
did I have with you?

26:14.207 --> 26:15.876
Especially after...

26:23.650 --> 26:24.785
You got kids?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.088
Two.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.657
Pictures?

26:32.025 --> 26:33.627
Yeah.

26:42.836 --> 26:44.037
That's Jake.

26:46.239 --> 26:47.641
He's seven.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.744
And, um, that's Johnnie.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.079
He's three.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.217
PATRICK: They're beautiful.

27:04.224 --> 27:06.226
I wish you could have
stuck by me.

27:07.227 --> 27:08.929
Helped me
through the trial.

27:11.765 --> 27:13.800
We've known each other,
what, since seventh grade?

27:16.002 --> 27:18.371
You don't even come
see me at the trial.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.406
BOBBY: She was a character
witness, Patrick.

27:22.175 --> 27:23.977
Her testimony
wasn't important.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.046
Hey, it was
important to me.

27:28.448 --> 27:29.916
She knew me.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.757
I thought if I could
make anyone understand,
it would have been you.

27:41.261 --> 27:42.328
Now look at her.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.166
We were gonna
get married.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.336
Now she's afraid
to even sit down

27:50.370 --> 27:52.205
and have
a conversation with me.

27:57.477 --> 27:59.212
(dry chuckle)

28:00.413 --> 28:02.082
This could have
been my life.

28:06.953 --> 28:11.024
McGUIRE (over megaphone):
Patrick Rooney, this is
the Boston PD.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.165
(gunshots)
(indistinct shouting)

28:20.500 --> 28:22.769
No one will get hurt
if you do as we say.

28:22.803 --> 28:24.270
(sirens approaching)

28:25.972 --> 28:27.340
Hey, I got
people in here!

28:28.341 --> 28:29.943
It's him-- Rooney.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.213
Let's talk
this out, Patrick.

28:33.246 --> 28:34.748
Tell me what's going on.

28:35.516 --> 28:37.117
Oh, my God.

28:39.319 --> 28:40.821
Are you okay?

28:40.854 --> 28:42.355
We're all right.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.757
How many are you?

28:43.790 --> 28:45.125
Three.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.127
Hey, hold it right there!

28:48.094 --> 28:49.796
I said get back!

28:51.464 --> 28:52.899
I'm not armed, Patrick.

28:52.933 --> 28:54.134
See?

28:55.068 --> 28:57.838
You heard me.
Get back!

28:57.871 --> 29:00.440
McGUIRE: Come on, Patrick.
I want to help you.

29:00.473 --> 29:03.844
Tell me what you want.
We'll work it out.

29:03.877 --> 29:06.379
Talk to him.
You shut up.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.214
It's not too late
to end this all peacefully.

29:08.248 --> 29:10.450
Patrick, you can--
you can get out of this.

29:10.483 --> 29:12.152
Tell him
you want an offer.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.254
What are you
talking about? No.

29:14.287 --> 29:15.856
Talk deal,
and we'll consider!

29:15.889 --> 29:18.358
Bobby.
A deal!

29:18.391 --> 29:20.060
Give us something
to work with!

29:20.093 --> 29:21.327
You speaking for Rooney?

29:21.361 --> 29:22.563
No!
Yes!

29:22.596 --> 29:24.130
No!

29:31.104 --> 29:32.506
Let's get
the snipers in place.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.280
(sirens wailing)
(helicopter circling)

29:40.313 --> 29:43.584
FEMALE REPORTER: It's still
unclear as to when the hostages
were abducted.

29:43.617 --> 29:46.319
Our sources say
it began in the morning.

29:46.352 --> 29:50.090
We do know that the suspect's
name is Patrick Kevin Rooney,

29:50.123 --> 29:53.026
released just three days ago
from Cedar Junction

29:53.059 --> 29:56.096
after serving 12 years
for a double homicide.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.933
One of the hostages
is Robert Donnell,
the attorney of record

29:59.966 --> 30:03.203
who handled Mr. Rooney's
murder trial 12 years ago.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.238
Yeah, mishandled
is more like it.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.608
Patrick, you got to decide
what you want to do here.

30:07.641 --> 30:09.109
What do you want me to do?

30:09.943 --> 30:12.112
You want me to make a deal,
huh, Bobby?

30:12.145 --> 30:14.280
You want me to make a deal so
you can go on with your life?

30:14.314 --> 30:17.584
No.
Not this time. No deals.

30:17.618 --> 30:20.521
Can't you see the man's
trying to help you, Patrick?

30:22.388 --> 30:25.325
Or what, you want to die here
in your grandfather's house?

30:26.392 --> 30:27.994
Real nice for his memory.

30:33.033 --> 30:34.601
(helicopter whirring)

30:34.635 --> 30:38.271
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:38.304 --> 30:40.006
You had a clean shot there.
Why didn't you take it?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.341
We try to negotiate first
before shooting them.

30:41.374 --> 30:44.144
Yeah, but how long--
Helen, please.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.880
This isn't good. The guy
isn't even making any demands.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.082
Which means?
Which means
he hasn't got a plan,

30:49.115 --> 30:50.884
which means he's probably
out of control.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.352
They should just
take him out.

30:52.385 --> 30:53.920
Well, let's hope
they can.

30:54.955 --> 30:57.891
(panting)

30:59.325 --> 31:02.596
This wasn't supposed
to happen, not like this.

31:02.629 --> 31:06.032
McGUIRE: Patrick,
are you listening to me?

31:06.066 --> 31:08.669
Come out now, and we'll work
something out. I promise.

31:08.702 --> 31:11.137
He promised.
Shut up, you.

31:11.171 --> 31:14.240
Patrick, your mission here,
as I understand it,

31:14.274 --> 31:17.578
was to show me and Suzie
that you didn't do the crime.

31:17.611 --> 31:20.180
To convince me I screwed up
by not believing you,

31:20.213 --> 31:22.182
and finding this witness.
You've done all this!

31:23.316 --> 31:25.519
That was only half
of my mission.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.220
The other half
was to kill you.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.222
Then do it!

31:29.255 --> 31:31.024
And get it over with!
(gun cocks)

31:31.057 --> 31:33.026
Fine!
SEYMOUR: Don't antagonize him,
for God's sake.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.628
In which case the police will
be charging in to shoot you!

31:34.661 --> 31:36.096
Stop it!

31:38.098 --> 31:41.968
There is a way out.
Let me talk to them.

31:42.002 --> 31:44.505
If I can get you out of this,
Patrick, let me try.

31:44.538 --> 31:45.939
Let me try.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.140
No.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.610
(inhales) No.

31:51.111 --> 31:54.247
SUZIE: You don't want
to die here, Patrick.

31:56.550 --> 31:58.184
You can't want to die.

32:02.422 --> 32:03.690
Patrick?

32:13.567 --> 32:15.101
All right.

32:15.536 --> 32:16.703
Let's go.

32:19.405 --> 32:22.108
You stay where
I can see you.
You hear me?

32:23.744 --> 32:25.111
(door opens)

32:26.012 --> 32:27.648
(overlapping chatter)

32:27.681 --> 32:29.482
McGUIRE: Hold up,
everybody, hold up!

32:29.516 --> 32:31.251
Hold up!

32:36.022 --> 32:37.157
We're ready to talk.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.361
All right, Bobby.
Go to the phone.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.196
Not you, Mike.

32:45.365 --> 32:46.567
Someone who can make good.

32:47.801 --> 32:49.703
(telephone rings)

32:52.405 --> 32:53.774
Everyone goes free

32:53.807 --> 32:55.375
in exchange
for charges dropped.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.644
Bobby.
Helen, that's the way
it's got to be.

32:57.678 --> 32:59.580
Can he hear us?

33:00.714 --> 33:03.316
No. That's the offer.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.420
All right, tell him--
tell him to send out
the hostages,

33:07.453 --> 33:09.122
and we will drop
all charges.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.692
That won't work.
You got to do better
than that.

33:13.326 --> 33:15.428
All right, all right, we'll
keep the parole violation.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.330
Suspended sentence.
Whatever.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.700
You're not listening.
He's not doing time.

33:19.733 --> 33:23.269
We agree to no time,
or there's no deal.

33:23.303 --> 33:25.205
The guy's got a gun.
He's about to shoot me.

33:26.406 --> 33:28.542
Okay, uh, I'm just
going to keep talking

33:28.575 --> 33:30.476
so it looks like
we're responding.

33:30.511 --> 33:32.478
Lindsay's doing okay.

33:32.513 --> 33:35.616
We're all taking care of her.
Bobby, we'll get you out.

33:35.649 --> 33:37.417
That's the only deal
we're making.

33:41.121 --> 33:42.523
(hangs up)

33:42.556 --> 33:44.057
Okay, here's the offer.

33:45.258 --> 33:47.427
They won't file
on kidnapping, assault,

33:47.460 --> 33:49.295
or false imprisonment,

33:49.329 --> 33:51.431
but the parole violation
stands.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.766
No.

33:52.799 --> 33:54.500
Patrick,
this is on the news.

33:54.535 --> 33:57.604
They can't just tell the public
they let you walk free.

33:57.638 --> 33:59.706
I have Helen Gamble's word
she'll agree

33:59.740 --> 34:01.441
to a suspended sentence
on the parole violation,

34:01.474 --> 34:03.644
so in essence,
you will be walking free.

34:03.677 --> 34:05.612
No judge is gonna
sign off on that.

34:05.646 --> 34:07.413
The judge will go along
if we can show

34:07.447 --> 34:10.183
you were wrongly convicted.
We'll need you for that.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.252
Fine.

34:13.820 --> 34:16.322
You can get out
of all this, Patrick.

34:16.356 --> 34:17.658
All of it.

34:17.690 --> 34:19.324
It's not too late.

34:22.262 --> 34:25.331
It's not too late.
No.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.367
No, I want
your life ruined.

34:27.400 --> 34:31.237
I want your life ruined
just like you ruined mine.

34:31.271 --> 34:33.239
Patrick, you want the world

34:33.273 --> 34:35.141
to know that you're not
a murderer.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.321
I won't go back
to prison?

34:50.255 --> 34:51.491
No.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.563
You leave last.

34:58.699 --> 35:00.867
We're told the police
have established dialogue

35:00.901 --> 35:02.836
with the suspect,
and an arrangement

35:02.869 --> 35:05.639
may have been made
to release the hostages.

35:08.542 --> 35:10.176
What is happening?

35:10.210 --> 35:11.444
I'm not sure.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.646
(door opens)

35:15.882 --> 35:17.417
Who's he?

35:17.450 --> 35:18.785
I have no idea.

35:18.819 --> 35:21.421
(men shouting)

35:30.330 --> 35:31.598
All right, Suzie.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.640
Bye.

35:43.610 --> 35:44.911
I didn't do it.

35:47.781 --> 35:49.149
I know, Patrick.

35:50.884 --> 35:52.352
I know.

35:56.289 --> 35:57.658
(crying) I'm sorry.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.597
I'm sorry.

36:10.904 --> 36:12.939
Maybe I'll meet
your kids someday, huh?

36:20.446 --> 36:21.848
Go ahead.

36:21.882 --> 36:23.349
Get out of here.

36:47.941 --> 36:49.275
You okay?

36:49.810 --> 36:50.944
You got a girl?

36:53.880 --> 36:55.315
Engaged.

36:57.483 --> 36:58.852
She's out there.

36:59.820 --> 37:01.354
Scared to death.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.759
She's special, huh?

37:08.529 --> 37:09.930
Yeah.

37:14.568 --> 37:17.270
Look, I'm sorry. I should
have found that witness.

37:21.542 --> 37:22.743
I'm sorry.

37:27.514 --> 37:29.616
You talked about
the ten years before.

37:30.717 --> 37:31.818
My priors.

37:34.354 --> 37:35.656
The last two,
I was clean.

37:36.890 --> 37:38.592
I was getting
my life together.

37:40.460 --> 37:42.028
Maybe I could have been
a lawyer or something.

37:42.062 --> 37:43.664
Who knows?

37:43.697 --> 37:45.832
MAN (on TV): Would any
deal hold up?

37:45.866 --> 37:50.003
It really wouldn't matter
what the DA was offering
in terms of a plea.

37:50.036 --> 37:53.373
They could, in effect,
promise the suspect
anything under the sun

37:53.406 --> 37:55.909
and then vitiate the deal
on grounds of duress.

37:56.910 --> 37:58.311
What does vitiate mean?

37:59.379 --> 38:01.081
What the hell
does vitiate mean?

38:01.114 --> 38:03.684
(TV continues, indistinct)

38:05.986 --> 38:07.453
There's no deal,
is there?

38:10.957 --> 38:12.058
You've screwed me again.

38:12.092 --> 38:13.794
The DA--
she agreed, so--

38:15.729 --> 38:18.532
Is there a deal or not?

38:19.933 --> 38:21.401
There's a deal.

38:23.737 --> 38:25.906
Bobby. Bobby!

38:25.939 --> 38:27.508
McGUIRE:
Get her out of here!

38:29.442 --> 38:31.578
REPORTER: We can't tell
exactly what's going on,

38:31.612 --> 38:34.715
but we just heard the sound
of gunfire from within the house

38:34.748 --> 38:36.349
where the gunman
is still holding

38:36.382 --> 38:38.652
Bobby Donnell,
the Boston attorney.

38:38.685 --> 38:41.454
Sierra one,
if you can get a shot.

38:43.156 --> 38:44.591
Patrick?

38:46.793 --> 38:48.629
Patrick, if you could
hear me...

38:50.931 --> 38:52.465
Dial the number.

38:52.498 --> 38:53.967
(phone beeps)

38:55.168 --> 38:56.870
Patrick,
pick up the phone.

38:58.839 --> 39:01.742
Let's talk. I need you
to answer the phone.

39:11.184 --> 39:13.486
Anybody does anything,
and he dies.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.088
Patrick--
Shut up.

39:15.121 --> 39:17.524
(Bobby groans)
You hear me?

39:17.558 --> 39:18.892
McGUIRE: What do you want?

39:18.925 --> 39:22.128
I want you to send in
the district attorney!

39:22.162 --> 39:23.764
And only her!

39:23.797 --> 39:25.498
Patrick, we can't.

39:25.532 --> 39:28.569
I know she's out there!
Send her in!

39:28.602 --> 39:29.970
You got a shot?

39:30.003 --> 39:31.772
MAN: Barely.

39:33.707 --> 39:35.475
Patrick, release Mr. Donnell,

39:35.509 --> 39:37.077
and we'll send in
the DA.

39:37.110 --> 39:38.679
No. No way.

39:38.712 --> 39:40.480
Patrick, please!

39:40.514 --> 39:43.784
You send her in right now,
or he dies!

39:43.817 --> 39:45.451
If you release
Mr. Donnell--

39:45.485 --> 39:47.954
He dies on the count
of three.

39:47.988 --> 39:49.690
Do you understand me?

39:49.723 --> 39:50.924
Let me go.
Not a chance.

39:50.957 --> 39:52.626
One!
Patrick!

39:54.027 --> 39:55.195
Two!

39:55.228 --> 39:56.897
Take him.

39:56.930 --> 39:58.632
(gunshot, echoing)
(gasps)

40:10.811 --> 40:11.912
Oh, my God.

40:41.775 --> 40:44.110
ANGELA: One single
gunshot wound to the head,

40:44.144 --> 40:46.079
Mr. Rooney went down
immediately.

40:46.112 --> 40:49.716
The hostage, Robert Donnell,
was unhurt.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.853
Patrick Kevin Rooney was
pronounced dead on the scene.

40:52.886 --> 40:55.589
Police homicide detective
Mike McGuire

40:55.622 --> 40:57.490
spoke later
about the incident.

41:13.707 --> 41:16.810
I did screw up his case.

41:16.843 --> 41:18.912
Bobby...
I was right out
of school.

41:20.547 --> 41:22.616
Taking three assignments
at a clip,

41:22.649 --> 41:25.519
seventeen hours a day,
trying to scratch.

41:28.021 --> 41:30.791
I trusted the DAs then.

41:30.824 --> 41:33.093
If they told me the guy
was guilty, I believed them.

41:37.130 --> 41:38.932
I probably did push
that deal on him

41:38.965 --> 41:41.067
without even bothering
to track down the witness.

41:43.303 --> 41:45.672
Took one look
at his rap sheet and...

41:47.307 --> 41:48.942
...prejudged him.

41:51.978 --> 41:53.580
And I doubt--

41:53.614 --> 41:55.649
I doubt
it was the only time.

42:02.355 --> 42:03.990
I thought I'd lost you.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.796
The whole time, all I could
see was your face.

42:13.734 --> 42:15.101
It's over.

42:19.372 --> 42:21.074
Your face.

42:29.750 --> 42:31.217
All I can see now...

42:34.621 --> 42:35.822
...is his.

42:55.241 --> 42:59.045
(music playing)

43:21.367 --> 43:22.636
You stinker!
