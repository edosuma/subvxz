[Dustin] <i>And then I got in the car
to come here,</i>

00:08.792 --> 00:12.045
and I'm putting on my seat belt,
and I hear my shoulder pop.

00:12.129 --> 00:14.882
I mean, I hear my body making
bad noises all day.

00:14.965 --> 00:17.801
- [Dr. Powell] Well, you're getting older.
- Yeah. I'm getting older.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.679
[sighs] It's got me thinking that, um...

00:21.597 --> 00:24.850
I don't know, when I'm on my death bed
and someone is deciding to pull the plug,

00:24.933 --> 00:29.229
I want it to be my kid,
not my pool guy, you know?

00:29.313 --> 00:30.457
Not that I have a pool, but...

00:30.481 --> 00:31.690
"My kid."

00:31.774 --> 00:33.609
Did you notice
that you just said "my kid"?

00:33.692 --> 00:36.237
[chuckles] Well, yeah, I mean, I...

00:36.320 --> 00:37.530
[inhales sharply]

00:37.613 --> 00:40.449
I've been thinking lately
that maybe I want to start a family.

00:41.074 --> 00:44.412
What exactly is going on between you
and Mickey right now?

00:44.495 --> 00:45.663
- How is it?
- Great.

00:45.746 --> 00:46.830
I mean...

00:47.790 --> 00:50.459
obviously things went bad
the first time around, but...

00:51.294 --> 00:53.587
I don't know. Feels different this time.

00:53.671 --> 00:55.881
I like hearing this.
It's what I've been drilling here.

00:55.964 --> 00:57.466
You deserve to be happy.

00:57.550 --> 01:02.054
You... you need to feel entitled
to your own happiness.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.013
Yeah.

01:04.096 --> 01:05.974
No, definitely. I'm...

01:08.101 --> 01:10.771
I am entitled to be
in a relationship with Mickey.

01:10.854 --> 01:12.315
I mean, that's what I want.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.192
I can't fuck this up again.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.320
Okay. Well, that's your time.

01:17.403 --> 01:20.155
- And I'm gonna see you next week, okay?
- Okay.

01:20.238 --> 01:21.449
Just a little FYI.

01:21.532 --> 01:25.202
I'm having this mindfulness retreat
at Esalen next month.

01:25.285 --> 01:29.540
No pressure, but if you and Mickey felt
that it would be, uh,

01:29.623 --> 01:31.083
valuable to you two...

01:31.166 --> 01:33.168
[stutters] I'll run it by her.

01:33.251 --> 01:35.379
Uh, the meals are included in the price.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.965
[theme music playing]

01:55.774 --> 01:57.294
We need to change the music
on this show.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.779
I mean, every time we do a serious moment,
they play violins.

02:00.863 --> 02:02.698
It makes me want to claw
my fucking ears off.

02:02.781 --> 02:04.783
Okay, Mickey. Can I just do this?

02:06.076 --> 02:08.621
Whoo! I just talked to Business Affairs

02:08.704 --> 02:10.330
and Stella's deal is closed.

02:10.413 --> 02:14.418
So, she is officially part
of the Gravity Subzero family. [chuckles]

02:14.502 --> 02:16.169
Wow! That's...

02:17.546 --> 02:18.964
Wow, that's cool. [chuckles]

02:19.047 --> 02:20.383
You made our asses look good.

02:20.466 --> 02:21.592
That's 'cause I'm hot shit.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.387
Well, your hot shit came out of
our lame asses. [laughs]

02:24.512 --> 02:26.013
[Dr. Greg chuckles softly]

02:26.597 --> 02:28.724
I just wanted to give you the good news.

02:28.807 --> 02:31.685
And, so, later, just swing by my office,
okay? Yes!

02:32.811 --> 02:34.312
Well...

02:34.397 --> 02:36.189
congrats, Mickey. [chuckles]

02:36.273 --> 02:38.776
Thanks. I know you don't mean that,
but, whatever.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.444
No, I do. Seriously.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.237
Bravo.

02:43.739 --> 02:47.075
Thank you. I, uh, appreciate that. Um...

02:49.828 --> 02:51.329
That's... that's nice.

02:54.625 --> 02:55.918
It's funny, huh?

02:56.001 --> 02:59.630
Sometimes it's hard for us
to accept a compliment, right?

03:00.923 --> 03:02.508
I'm wired the same way, too.

03:02.591 --> 03:06.178
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to accept
a pat on the back at work,

03:06.261 --> 03:08.972
when you're shitting the bed
in the rest of your life.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.933
- Oh.
- [sighs]

03:11.975 --> 03:13.644
What's wrong? Something up?

03:13.727 --> 03:16.564
- Oh, like I would ever tell you.
- Oh, come on.

03:16.647 --> 03:19.692
[stutters] Look, I know
that we used to clash, but...

03:20.734 --> 03:22.736
remember how we used to get along?

03:22.820 --> 03:26.865
You know, I'd really things to go back
to being like that.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.784
Supportive, kind.

03:28.867 --> 03:31.579
You know, really...
really there for each other.

03:33.288 --> 03:34.790
Okay, um...

03:35.999 --> 03:40.087
Well, Gus went out of town for work,
and it was really hard.

03:41.379 --> 03:43.632
And then I started seeing an ex...

03:44.633 --> 03:46.927
and then he got super clingy,

03:47.010 --> 03:51.640
and now, Gus is back in town
and I don't know what to do.

03:51.724 --> 03:54.518
Wow. That's a...
a lot to unpack there. Hmm?

03:54.602 --> 03:55.811
Yeah.

03:59.898 --> 04:02.025
So, what do you think?
Do you have any advice?

04:02.109 --> 04:03.944
Oh, I don't really have any advice.

04:04.027 --> 04:05.529
I don't know what I could give.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.048
You're a fucking nightmare. [chuckles]

04:07.072 --> 04:08.574
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, no.

04:08.657 --> 04:11.326
[stutters] I didn't mean it
to come out that way.

04:12.828 --> 04:15.247
- Uh, just, please go.
- Yeah.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.916
But, hey. Maybe it's a good thing
that we said it out loud.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.125
You said it.

04:19.752 --> 04:22.420
Yeah. But... now it's out there.

04:22.505 --> 04:25.090
So, you can address it. [chuckles softly]

04:26.800 --> 04:29.344
Excuse me, I'm gonna go get a donut.
[chuckles nervously]

04:29.427 --> 04:32.890
But seriously, [stutters]
I still want you to talk to me if you...

04:32.973 --> 04:34.266
Right.

04:37.770 --> 04:39.312
[Chris] Hey, everybody listen up!

04:39.396 --> 04:41.732
- Cruikshank's back, motherfucker!
- [all cheer]

04:42.983 --> 04:44.359
Whoo!

04:44.442 --> 04:45.736
Hey!

04:45.819 --> 04:49.948
- All right, hey, guys. Oh. I'll do it.
- Gus, my boy!

04:50.866 --> 04:52.200
Put it down. Let's get a picture.

04:52.284 --> 04:55.162
- Chris! Come on, get a picture with us.
- [Chris] All right, all right.

04:55.245 --> 04:58.165
- A group pic on three. One, two, three...
- [camera clicks]

04:58.248 --> 04:59.500
[Gus] And four.

05:33.576 --> 05:36.287
How are you, dude?
How was working on, uh, <i>Liberty Is Free?</i>

05:36.369 --> 05:37.745
- Oh, <i>Liberty Down.</i>
- Yeah.

05:37.830 --> 05:40.165
Yeah. It was, uh... It was okay.

05:40.248 --> 05:43.251
You know, it's just a little tough
being away from home.

05:43.335 --> 05:45.170
- Being away from Mickey.
- Ah...

05:45.253 --> 05:47.356
Bertie said Mickey was having
a hard time with it, too.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.049
- Oh, she said that?
- Yeah.

05:49.132 --> 05:52.052
Yeah, well, I don't know.
I mean, at first...

05:52.386 --> 05:54.388
[inhales sharply] At first, it was fine.

05:54.471 --> 05:56.181
- We were talking every day.
- Uh-huh.

05:56.264 --> 05:57.766
- It was going well.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:57.850 --> 06:01.103
And then, by the end there,
we weren't, like, talking at all.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.896
- Oh, man...
- And I started...

06:02.980 --> 06:06.358
getting the vibe of, like,
"Oh, she's not into this anymore,

06:06.441 --> 06:09.402
and she wants it to be over."

06:09.486 --> 06:11.655
But then, last night she texted me,

06:11.739 --> 06:14.783
and wanted to see if I wanted
to hang out tomorrow, so...

06:14.867 --> 06:15.868
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Awesome.

06:15.951 --> 06:18.704
I don't want to, like,
pat myself on the back here too hard.

06:18.787 --> 06:21.289
But those last few days in Atlanta,

06:21.373 --> 06:25.711
you know, I just... I took a step back,
and I gave her her space.

06:25.794 --> 06:29.882
And I think that's, like, why she's
texting me now, you know? It worked.

06:29.965 --> 06:32.259
Yeah, me and Bertie
were kind of like the same thing.

06:32.342 --> 06:35.763
Like, we broke up,
and I was home crying all the time.

06:35.846 --> 06:38.598
And then I didn't call her
'cause I was gonna kill myself.

06:38.682 --> 06:40.350
She thought that I was giving her space.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.061
- Mmm-hmm.
- So, she got back with me.

06:43.145 --> 06:46.106
Oh, look at us, man.
We are, like, killing it.

06:46.189 --> 06:47.775
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:48.358 --> 06:50.736
All right, well,
I'm gonna get back to this party.

06:50.819 --> 06:53.405
You can stay here if you like.
[grunts] Nice and comfy.

06:53.488 --> 06:55.282
Yeah. The coats are comfy.

06:56.324 --> 06:57.450
Hey, Gus.

06:57.534 --> 07:01.789
If I borrowed, like, $100 from you,
I could pay you back $110 later on.

07:01.872 --> 07:06.043
- If you were cool with that.
- Oh. Yeah, maybe.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.755
Or, you know what, I'm trying to sell
my Nintendo 64, if you're interested.

07:09.838 --> 07:11.924
- Let's talk about it later.
- Okay.

07:12.007 --> 07:14.509
- Get back to this party. Okay.
- Cool.

07:18.013 --> 07:19.014
[sighs]

07:19.097 --> 07:20.515
[Frank] <i>Adiós, amigo.</i>

07:20.598 --> 07:22.786
- Bye-bye. See you.
- You gotta drop by our place again.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.728
We got some new speakers,
and I'm serious,

07:24.812 --> 07:26.689
you put on <i>Houses of the Holy,</i> right,

07:26.772 --> 07:29.566
and it sounds like Zep's playing
in your living room.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.651
Wow.

07:30.734 --> 07:33.445
- Well, sign me up. I... I'll be by soon.
- [Frank] We gotta go.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.155
Getting out of here, too, man.

07:35.238 --> 07:38.158
Okay, Kev, and uh, hey, now that
I'm back in town, we gotta hang out.

07:38.241 --> 07:39.761
- For sure.
- Yeah, I'm gonna turn this

07:39.785 --> 07:41.787
work friendship into a real friendship.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.664
There's nothing you can do about it.
Sorry.

07:43.747 --> 07:45.516
It's all good.
I already knew we were friends.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.143
Ever since you started coming
to the snack table

07:47.167 --> 07:49.437
- when you didn't want somethin'.
- Yeah, that's a telltale sign.

07:49.461 --> 07:50.689
- I knew what was up.
- Yeah, you knew.

07:50.713 --> 07:52.315
- All right. Bye, buddy.
- See you soon, man.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.674
Oh, Gus. I forgot to tell you.

07:53.757 --> 07:56.176
We saw your little sweetheart
the other day.

07:56.259 --> 07:57.499
- That's right.
- [Gus] You did?

07:57.552 --> 08:00.114
- Yeah, she was out hiking with her friend.
- Wait. Mickey was hiking?

08:00.138 --> 08:01.514
- [Wade] Yeah.
- With what friend?

08:01.598 --> 08:03.016
- Shaun or...
- No, it was some guy.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.434
- Was a dude.
- Some guy?

08:04.517 --> 08:06.603
- [Chris] All right. Let me at him!
- Hey!

08:06.687 --> 08:07.914
- Welcome back, man.
- [Wade] Love you, man.

08:07.938 --> 08:09.290
[Gus] Hey, guys. Thanks for coming over.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.625
- It was good to see you.
- Great to see you. I'm glad you're back.

08:11.649 --> 08:12.901
- I appreciate it.
- See you.

08:12.985 --> 08:14.628
- Let me know about that Nintendo 64.
- Sure.

08:14.652 --> 08:16.989
- Yeah, yeah. Okay. Bye.
- [Beth] Bye!

08:17.072 --> 08:18.406
[chuckles]

08:26.164 --> 08:27.374
[cell phone chimes]

08:39.135 --> 08:40.595
[Mickey] Hey!

08:40.678 --> 08:41.679
Hey.

08:42.429 --> 08:43.724
You look tan.

08:44.516 --> 08:46.810
- Really? Do I?
- Uh... I don't know.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.772
Feel like that's what people say
when someone comes back from a trip.

08:49.855 --> 08:52.190
Well, then,
let's just say I look super tan.

08:57.029 --> 08:58.155
Hey.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.328
- You want to order something?
- Sure. Yeah.

09:06.288 --> 09:08.081
So, how have you been?

09:08.165 --> 09:10.042
Good. Good to be back. Yeah.

09:11.459 --> 09:13.670
- How about you? How are you?
- Good. Good. Yeah.

09:22.054 --> 09:23.221
[scatting]

09:23.305 --> 09:26.599
Things got, uh... pretty crazy
between the two of us there.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.435
Yeah, I know.

09:28.518 --> 09:31.271
Time apart can really, uh,
fuck up a relationship.

09:31.354 --> 09:34.024
I mean, that's what happened
to my best friends, Katy and Russell.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.317
Who?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.944
Oh, did I not tell you?

09:37.027 --> 09:40.113
My best friends are Katy Perry
and Russell Brand?

09:40.197 --> 09:43.492
- No, you never mentioned that.
- Yeah, yeah. They're good kids.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.118
- [man] How's it going?
- Hey.

09:45.202 --> 09:47.830
Can I get, um, a soy latte?

09:48.831 --> 09:51.458
And I will take a ordinary latte.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.376
- Ha! I got it.
- Thank you.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.295
Ah. Thanks, Mickey.

09:55.838 --> 09:59.466
And, hey, I just want to say,
you know, as far as us being apart, I...

10:00.592 --> 10:03.511
I know I could have handled things better.
I was way out of line there.

10:03.595 --> 10:06.139
- It's fine, whatever.
- No, Mickey.

10:06.223 --> 10:07.432
I'm serious.

10:07.515 --> 10:10.602
You're right. I am very codependent.

10:10.685 --> 10:12.562
And it's scary for me
to look at my own shit,

10:12.645 --> 10:14.982
so I focus on yours 'cause it's easier,

10:15.065 --> 10:18.026
and that's just super unfair to you,
and...

10:18.110 --> 10:19.194
I am sorry.

10:20.946 --> 10:23.198
I... I appreciate that. Thank you.

10:23.281 --> 10:24.992
Yeah. I just... I don't know, I gotta...

10:25.075 --> 10:27.702
try my best,
just look at my own shit, you know?

10:27.785 --> 10:29.662
- Well, Al-Anon can help with that.
- Hmm.

10:29.746 --> 10:32.582
Yeah. Well, I've actually gone
to a few meetings, so...

10:32.665 --> 10:36.669
What? Really?
Gus, that's amazing. I'm so proud of you.

10:36.753 --> 10:39.840
- Ah.
- Um, I'm sorry. That was condescending.

10:39.923 --> 10:42.134
No. No, no. Not at all.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.219
- [man] There you go.
- Hey.

10:44.302 --> 10:46.179
[Mickey] Really? You've never?

10:46.263 --> 10:48.098
I'm serious. I've never had a wet dream.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.850
- Oh, my God.
- It's weird. I know.

10:49.933 --> 10:52.093
- [cell phone vibrating]
- I don't know why. [chuckles]

10:55.105 --> 10:56.106
Oh.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.877
You can reply to that if you need to.
It's cool.

10:58.901 --> 11:00.527
- It's fine. Yeah.
- You sure? Okay.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.946
Do you have any, uh, plans today?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.614
What are your Saturday plans?

11:04.697 --> 11:07.951
I'm doing the laundry.
I am paying my bills.

11:08.618 --> 11:10.662
I'm going to the post office.

11:10.745 --> 11:14.332
Just some... real exciting shit, Mickey.

11:14.416 --> 11:18.295
Hmm. Well, maybe you could come by
my place later? Like, 9:00 or 10:00?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.422
Yeah. Sure.

11:32.809 --> 11:35.395
I'm glad you're back. I missed you.

11:36.771 --> 11:37.855
I missed you, too.

11:40.608 --> 11:43.820
Hey, remember that time I went to Atlanta
and we both flipped out?

11:43.903 --> 11:47.157
- Oh... such fond memories.
- [chuckles]

12:05.508 --> 12:07.677
- [Dustin] You gotta taste this sauce.
- [Mickey] What?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.637
Taste this sauce I made. It is amazing.

12:10.973 --> 12:13.141
Mmm. That was really hot.

12:13.225 --> 12:14.934
Oh, sorry, should've warned you.

12:15.018 --> 12:18.229
But it's good, right?
I am killing it with sauces lately.

12:18.646 --> 12:20.023
Yeah, it's good.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.232
Yeah, but you taste better.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.443
Mmm, thank you.

12:25.028 --> 12:26.779
What's wrong? You're acting weird.

12:29.782 --> 12:32.244
I don't think we should do this anymore.

12:37.915 --> 12:38.916
Do what?

12:39.876 --> 12:42.504
You and me. All of it.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.339
It's moving...

12:45.507 --> 12:46.799
too fast.

12:46.883 --> 12:49.261
It's getting too serious,
and I'm not ready for it.

12:49.344 --> 12:51.846
I think we should break it off.

12:59.896 --> 13:00.897
[clicks tongue]

13:01.856 --> 13:03.233
I guess we should.

13:06.444 --> 13:08.238
Okay, uh, I'm gonna go.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.240
I guess you are.

13:10.740 --> 13:13.493
- All right, take care.
- I will take care.

13:13.576 --> 13:18.040
Are you okay? 'Cause you, like, seem okay,
but, like, scary okay.

13:18.123 --> 13:20.125
- You should go now.
- [pot clangs]

13:20.208 --> 13:22.294
[softly] Okay. All right.

13:22.377 --> 13:24.296
Is this because that guy is back in town?

13:24.379 --> 13:27.090
The little tree sprite?
The one at the Springwood? Gus?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.592
No! This has nothing to do with him.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.804
Yeah, that guy will...
never make you happy.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.848
But I guess you want to be unhappy.

13:35.932 --> 13:38.476
Okay, yeah, you've got me all figured out.

13:39.436 --> 13:41.438
- Goodbye, Dustin.
- Goodbye, whore!

13:42.730 --> 13:45.358
See? There it goes!
You called me a whore again.

13:45.442 --> 13:47.819
You are the same. This is all the same.

13:50.613 --> 13:52.699
[door opens and slams]

13:55.535 --> 13:56.744
[exhales]

13:59.497 --> 14:00.707
[sighs]

14:03.335 --> 14:06.171
[music playing faintly over speakers]

14:07.589 --> 14:11.759
Bertie, I'm sorry for putting you
in an awkward situation with Dustin.

14:11.843 --> 14:14.053
That really was not fair of me.

14:14.137 --> 14:17.515
Oh, okay. I'm not mad anymore.

14:17.599 --> 14:20.102
I spoke to my mom about it, and she said,

14:20.185 --> 14:23.188
"Bertie, you're judging Mickey."
And my mom's right.

14:23.271 --> 14:24.731
And who am I to judge?

14:24.814 --> 14:28.776
I'm hooking back up with Randy again.
I mean, what the fuck am I doing?

14:28.860 --> 14:32.530
He only could pay me back 'cause
he borrowed more money from his family.

14:32.614 --> 14:34.824
He's really excited
about his new job at the moment,

14:34.907 --> 14:37.410
which is being in the background
of a TV show.

14:37.494 --> 14:38.661
He's in his 30s.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.247
Also, he loves it

14:40.330 --> 14:44.000
because he gets to lie on a gurney
during his lunch hour.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.668
- [chuckles]
- What am I doing?

14:45.752 --> 14:47.254
Why did I go back?

14:47.337 --> 14:49.797
They say that you go back
to painful situations

14:49.881 --> 14:51.966
because they're comfortable and familiar.

14:53.510 --> 14:54.511
I hear that.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.347
Sometimes when I'm in pain, I'm like,
"Hello, old friend."

14:57.430 --> 15:01.934
Yeah. I'm very comfortable with pain.
It's the happy part I'm not used to.

15:02.018 --> 15:04.937
Right. We need to get comfortable
with the happy part.

15:05.021 --> 15:06.564
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

15:06.648 --> 15:09.818
- Do you want the rest of this yogurt?
- No...

15:09.901 --> 15:12.570
All right, then.
It's goin' back in the fridge.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.535
Hey, Bertie, Gus is coming over tonight,
if you can handle that.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.663
Oh... sure.

15:21.746 --> 15:25.542
I mean... I definitely won't tell him
about Dustin,

15:25.625 --> 15:29.879
but I should probably tell you,
I've been told I'm a terrible liar.

15:29.962 --> 15:33.133
I mean, I don't think so.
I think I'm quite convincing,

15:33.216 --> 15:35.760
but people have told me
I'm really very bad at it.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.888
Well, I ended things with Dustin today,

15:38.971 --> 15:40.557
- if that makes it any easier.
- Really?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.766
How did that go down?

15:41.849 --> 15:46.563
You know how some guys when they're angry
are like, tick, tick... boom?

15:46.646 --> 15:48.022
Dustin's like tick, boom!

15:48.105 --> 15:50.192
You should've seen the look in his eye.
I mean...

15:50.275 --> 15:53.528
I didn't know
if I was gonna get out of there alive.

15:53.611 --> 15:56.239
Right. Are you gonna tell Gus
about any of this?

15:56.323 --> 15:59.075
No! Jesus, that would just hurt him.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.243
What if he asks?

16:00.327 --> 16:04.539
If he asks me if I've slept
with anybody else, then I will say yes.

16:04.622 --> 16:05.665
I'm not gonna lie.

16:05.748 --> 16:08.793
But I wasn't really
breaking the rules or whatever.

16:08.876 --> 16:11.128
Huh. Okay.

16:11.213 --> 16:12.672
[knock on door]

16:16.926 --> 16:18.511
- Hi! [chuckles]
- Hey, hey!

16:18.595 --> 16:20.012
- Hi, Mickey.
- Hi.

16:20.096 --> 16:21.931
- Hey!
- Hey, great to see you!

16:22.014 --> 16:23.574
It's good to see you, too. How are you?

16:23.641 --> 16:25.768
Gus, the craziest thing happened
at work today.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.270
You won't even believe it.

16:27.354 --> 16:31.566
There was this man, and he ate so many
Steak-umms, and he threw up everywhere,

16:31.649 --> 16:35.152
but then he still was like, "I love 'em!"
[chuckles] It was so stupid.

16:35.237 --> 16:36.597
- Oh, that's, uh...
- It was crazy!

16:36.654 --> 16:38.882
- I can see how that's funny.
- I'm gonna text my mom about it.

16:38.906 --> 16:41.534
Okay. Good to see ya.

16:41.618 --> 16:44.579
Ooh, that's a nasty little stain there.

16:44.662 --> 16:47.039
- Oh, yeah, it's wine. [sighs]
- Oh.

16:49.166 --> 16:51.043
I wasn't drinking.

16:51.127 --> 16:52.754
Okay, I wasn't saying anything.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.257
No, it was Bertie.
She had a full glass of wine

16:55.340 --> 16:58.926
and stubbed her toe on the coffee table
and it just spilled.

16:59.010 --> 17:00.678
It's all good. I don't care.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.930
[Mickey moans softly]

17:07.935 --> 17:09.271
- [Gus grunts]
- [sighs]

17:09.354 --> 17:11.856
I'm sorry that I acted so shitty
when we were apart.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.233
- I...
- It's okay. Don't...

17:13.316 --> 17:15.568
- No, I feel...
- I... I was...

17:15.652 --> 17:17.569
making you that way. It's fine.

17:17.654 --> 17:21.407
I think it's, like I said,
I'm really bad with separation, and...

17:21.491 --> 17:23.660
it made me act out and I'm...

17:24.743 --> 17:26.871
I'm sorry. I think I'm...

17:27.997 --> 17:30.207
way more into you than I even know.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.585
Aw.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.754
Well, me, too.

17:35.338 --> 17:39.426
I mean, I'm into you, not me.

17:39.509 --> 17:41.886
- Or... you get it.
- Hey, hey, I have a question for you.

17:41.970 --> 17:42.970
What? What?

17:43.513 --> 17:49.519
What do you always wanna do in bed,
but you're too nervous to ask for?

17:50.687 --> 17:53.315
Oh, uh... I don't know.

17:53.398 --> 17:57.777
Okay, well,
what have you always wanted to do,

17:57.860 --> 18:00.196
but you've never done?
'Cause I wanna do that.

18:01.155 --> 18:02.907
Oh, my God. That's so much pressure.

18:02.990 --> 18:05.993
That's like one of those things
I wish I had an answer for.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.371
You in your mind imagine,

18:08.455 --> 18:10.247
"Oh, I hope somebody asks me
this question."

18:10.332 --> 18:12.542
But I... I don't know.
I don't like talking...

18:12.625 --> 18:14.502
[inhales deeply] about sex.

18:14.586 --> 18:17.171
I'm up for anything in the moment, Mickey.

18:17.254 --> 18:20.425
What if I, like, put a finger up your ass?

18:20.508 --> 18:22.134
- Uh, maybe.
- Yeah?

18:22.218 --> 18:24.346
Yeah, just don't give me
a heads-up beforehand.

18:24.429 --> 18:26.782
It's like, I don't wanna know
the end of a movie before it happens.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.642
May I feel free to make a bold choice?

18:29.726 --> 18:31.311
- Yes. [chuckles]
- Okay.

18:31.394 --> 18:32.687
Make a bold choice.

18:42.447 --> 18:43.740
[yawns]

18:55.752 --> 18:57.587
- Good morning.
- [inhales deeply]

18:57.670 --> 18:59.881
[grunts softly] Good morning.

19:02.550 --> 19:03.801
[cell phone vibrating]

19:11.183 --> 19:13.783
[Mickey] Sounds like my phone's
blowing up. Can you hand it to me?

19:14.103 --> 19:15.438
[inhales deeply]

19:15.522 --> 19:17.522
- [grunts] Okay.
- [cell phone continues vibrating]

19:27.909 --> 19:29.326
Hey. [clears throat]

19:29.411 --> 19:31.037
Gus-Gus, let's get out of here.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.916
Really? We just woke up.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.376
I know, but I'm feelin' antsy.

19:36.459 --> 19:38.711
Let's get out of here.
Let's do something fun.

19:39.295 --> 19:40.295
Mmm.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.008
- Look at you.
- What are you doing?

19:44.091 --> 19:45.760
- I want to take your picture.
- No.

19:45.843 --> 19:48.345
- What?
- Morning photos are really nasty.

19:48.430 --> 19:49.514
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

19:49.597 --> 19:50.807
Morning photos are the best.

19:50.890 --> 19:55.061
You got messed up hair, little puffy eyes.
People are at their cutest in the morning.

19:55.144 --> 19:56.424
- I'm serious.
- I love it. What?

19:56.479 --> 19:58.606
Let's go do something.
What do you wanna do?

19:58.690 --> 20:00.483
You know what I always thought
could be fun?

20:00.567 --> 20:03.861
Uh, at the park they have, uh...
They have paddleboating.

20:03.945 --> 20:05.613
Perfect. Yeah, let's do it.

20:05.697 --> 20:07.073
- You wanna paddleboat?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:07.156 --> 20:08.156
Okay.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.201
Um...

20:10.284 --> 20:11.619
- I gotta piss first.
- Okay.

20:11.703 --> 20:13.162
- Okay.
- Quick piss.

20:14.622 --> 20:16.916
- [groaning]
- Come on, Gus. I'm serious.

20:16.999 --> 20:18.835
Okay, okay.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.336
Oh, fuck.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.065
I thought you weren't
a morning person either.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.298
That's why I like you.

20:24.381 --> 20:26.759
- [sighs]
- But you're... Okay, okay.

20:26.843 --> 20:28.260
[cell phone vibrating]

20:36.060 --> 20:37.895
[softly] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.192
[Gus] All right. Initiating paddleboat.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.152
Five, four...

20:45.236 --> 20:47.404
three, two...

20:48.615 --> 20:50.074
Fun?

20:55.455 --> 20:56.581
[knocking on door]

21:01.002 --> 21:02.482
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Dustin. How are you?

21:02.545 --> 21:04.338
- I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good.

21:04.421 --> 21:06.549
- Oh, do... Come in!
- Thanks.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.427
- Uh, is Mickey here?
- Uh, no.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.055
No. She... she stepped out.

21:13.139 --> 21:16.100
Okay. Do you know where she went?
Is she coming back soon?

21:16.183 --> 21:17.434
No.

21:17.519 --> 21:19.854
I don't know. She didn't say.

21:19.937 --> 21:20.980
Don't know.

21:21.063 --> 21:23.525
Okay. Just, uh, tell her I dropped by?

21:23.608 --> 21:25.151
Or, you know, don't worry about it.

21:25.234 --> 21:27.236
You know what? Let her know.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.531
- Okay. I'll give her the message.
- Okay.

21:31.282 --> 21:34.577
- Uh, also, I think I left a jacket here?
- Oh, I haven't seen one.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.787
What does it look like?

21:35.870 --> 21:38.455
Uh, it's like a letterman's jacket
type thing.

21:38.540 --> 21:40.917
- Cool.
- I may have left it in Mickey's room.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.585
Would you mind checking?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.104
I would go in there,
I just don't wanna root around

21:44.128 --> 21:45.188
in her stuff when she's not here.

21:45.212 --> 21:46.798
Oh, okay, sure. I'll go have a look.

21:46.881 --> 21:48.049
Thank you.

22:05.817 --> 22:07.151
[Bertie] What color is it?

22:07.819 --> 22:09.696
Uh, it's black and gold.

22:09.779 --> 22:11.197
[Bertie] That sounds nice.

22:18.287 --> 22:20.122
Sorry, Dustin, I've looked everywhere.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.709
- There's no sign of it. Sorry.
- No sign of it?

22:22.792 --> 22:24.544
Okay, no worries.
I'll keep looking for it.

22:24.627 --> 22:27.338
It'll turn up somewhere.
I will, uh, see you around.

22:27.421 --> 22:28.661
- [Bertie] Okay.
- Thanks again.

22:29.173 --> 22:30.299
Weird.

22:35.429 --> 22:38.099
So, yeah, I guess, like, a few years ago,
they drained this lake,

22:38.182 --> 22:41.227
and everybody was expecting
to find all these dead bodies.

22:41.644 --> 22:43.938
But then when they did it,
there were no dead bodies,

22:44.021 --> 22:45.981
and everybody was weirdly disappointed.
[chuckles]

22:48.525 --> 22:49.902
Glad you're back.

22:49.986 --> 22:52.488
Aw. I'm glad I'm back, too.

22:57.534 --> 22:59.120
[inhales deeply] It feels good.

23:16.428 --> 23:17.596
[Gus] You know what's cool?

23:17.680 --> 23:21.809
We both have the names
of Disney mice, right?

23:21.893 --> 23:24.479
'Cause I'm Gus-Gus from <i>Cinderella,</i>

23:24.561 --> 23:28.107
you're Mickey, as in the classic mouse.

23:28.190 --> 23:29.651
- Mickey Mouse, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:29.734 --> 23:30.985
You like being reminded of that

23:31.068 --> 23:33.195
- I'm sure, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.363
[Gus] Oh, cool.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.327
Uh, you know what?
Can we get some broccoli?

23:40.411 --> 23:42.079
'Cause I really, um...

23:42.163 --> 23:44.874
I'm just feeling
like I need more broccoli.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.043
And I also really have to go
to the bathroom,

23:47.126 --> 23:49.712
so maybe you can get the broccoli,

23:49.796 --> 23:51.463
- and I'll meet you...
- Are you okay?

23:51.547 --> 23:53.174
- [Mickey] Yeah.
- [Gus] You seem jumpy.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.342
[Mickey] Ugh, when I gotta pee I'm...
Um...

23:55.426 --> 23:58.304
Ask a lot of questions, make sure
you don't get, uh, ripped off, okay?

24:17.573 --> 24:21.327
[man] Fresh strawberries!
Papayas! Oranges!

24:21.410 --> 24:24.580
Lemon! Grapefruit! We got melons!

24:25.581 --> 24:27.166
- Pineapple?
- Sorry, hi.

24:27.249 --> 24:28.292
[man] Oh.

24:28.918 --> 24:30.127
[whispers] Gus! Gus, hi.

24:30.211 --> 24:31.796
Hey, how's it going?

24:31.879 --> 24:33.130
Hey, I got your broccoli.

24:33.214 --> 24:35.632
I haggled him down to $1,000.
I think that's fair, right?

24:35.717 --> 24:37.343
Yeah, you want to get out of here?

24:37.426 --> 24:39.446
I'm having a good time.
You want to check out a few more booths

24:39.470 --> 24:41.388
- and then maybe head home?
- Uh...

24:42.473 --> 24:45.559
Yeah, um,
how about I get you a massage?

24:45.642 --> 24:47.287
- I don't know. I don't need it.
- Come on!

24:47.311 --> 24:49.105
You got me broccoli.
I'll get you a massage.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.749
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm getting that for you.

24:50.773 --> 24:52.233
- What? Wow. Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.360
[Gus] That actually would be amazing
right now.

24:59.990 --> 25:00.990
Hey!

25:22.680 --> 25:25.433
- Hey, would you like some strawberries?
- Uh, no. No, thank you.

25:43.284 --> 25:45.828
[girls screaming and laughing]

25:45.912 --> 25:47.352
[man] You're a little tense in here.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.373
[Gus] Yeah,
I get really tense in my neck.

25:49.456 --> 25:50.499
- [man] Wow.
- [Gus] Yeah.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.334
- [man] Do you work out a lot?
- [chuckles]

25:52.418 --> 25:53.710
- [Gus] No. [chuckles]
- Really?

25:53.795 --> 25:55.671
- Construction work?
- [Gus] You flatter me.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.089
[man] Pressure point for all...

25:57.173 --> 25:58.966
Hey. Okay, uh, you ready to go?

25:59.050 --> 26:00.426
- Here you go.
- Huh?

26:00.509 --> 26:01.510
We just started.

26:01.593 --> 26:04.763
- It's hot. Feels like I'm gonna pass out.
- Yeah, sorry. Okay.

26:04.847 --> 26:06.967
- Thanks, so much.
- Mickey, this is Kent, by the way.

26:11.896 --> 26:12.980
[man] What the...

26:14.398 --> 26:15.399
No!

26:27.203 --> 26:29.080
- [Gus exhales] Ooh.
- [sighs] Oh, my God.

26:29.163 --> 26:31.165
It feels so good to be back inside.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.792
Sorry I was acting so weird back there.

26:33.876 --> 26:36.838
When I'm out in the sun for too long,
it kinda fries my brain.

26:36.921 --> 26:39.465
Oh, totally understand. It's all good.

26:39.548 --> 26:40.883
You don't have to convince me

26:40.967 --> 26:43.719
that the indoors are always better
than the outdoors.

26:43.802 --> 26:47.473
You know... I'm gonna get a soda
from the vending machine.

26:47.556 --> 26:50.184
- You want anything?
- Yeah, anything. Surprise me.

26:50.267 --> 26:53.312
All right, I will BRB.

26:54.605 --> 26:56.815
That's how the cool kids say
"be right back."

27:06.909 --> 27:08.119
[sighs]

27:13.582 --> 27:15.501
[Dustin] Excuse me,
do you know Gus Cruikshank?

27:17.503 --> 27:19.922
Hey, uh, [clears throat]
do you know my buddy Gus Cruikshank?

27:20.006 --> 27:21.257
- Who?
- Yeah.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.259
Do you guys know Gus Cruikshank
by any chance?

27:23.342 --> 27:26.470
All I'm saying is, you could've given us
a bigger heads up on this gray paint.

27:26.553 --> 27:29.181
That's, like, your one job
on the committee council.

27:29.265 --> 27:32.977
We put fliers announcing the change
in everyone's mailbox.

27:33.060 --> 27:36.563
Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't get one,
and I'm not okay with the change.

27:36.647 --> 27:40.734
- Gray is sad.
- Gray is sophisticated, elegant and cool.

27:40.817 --> 27:42.577
Excuse me,
either of you know Gus Cruikshank?

27:42.653 --> 27:43.853
- Yeah, he's my buddy.
- Great.

27:43.905 --> 27:45.745
We were just at the farmers market
with Mickey.

27:45.822 --> 27:47.324
I know Mickey, too. Great girl!

27:47.408 --> 27:48.718
- Yeah. My phone died.
- [Chris] Huh.

27:48.742 --> 27:50.411
And I don't know where Gus' place is.

27:50.494 --> 27:51.996
I'm pretty sure they came back here.

27:52.079 --> 27:55.499
Oh, yeah, this happens all the time.
Gus is over in Building E. Second floor.

27:55.582 --> 27:57.626
I want to say E-232.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.628
Two-thirty-two. Great.
Thanks. Appreciate it.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.213
No problem. Happy to help, <i>amigo!</i>

28:01.297 --> 28:02.965
[knocking on door]

28:04.383 --> 28:05.759
All right, cool your jets.

28:05.842 --> 28:07.178
[knocking continues]

28:09.471 --> 28:10.472
Is he here?

28:11.390 --> 28:13.267
- Fuck, dude!
- We need to talk.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.186
No, we do not need to talk.

28:15.269 --> 28:17.229
I'm not leaving until we talk!

28:18.730 --> 28:20.566
Okay, all right.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.526
Okay.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.278
[lock clicks]

28:24.361 --> 28:26.905
Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?

28:26.989 --> 28:30.117
You're chasing me around a farmers market?
You're stalking me?

28:30.201 --> 28:31.953
I am doing what I didn't do last time.

28:32.036 --> 28:33.745
I'm fighting for you.

28:33.829 --> 28:35.581
Well, don't. I don't want you to.

28:35.664 --> 28:37.583
Can you just please go
before Gus gets back?

28:37.666 --> 28:40.669
I wanna be here when he gets back.
I want to tell him about us.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.172
So you... you want to ruin this for me?

28:43.255 --> 28:47.217
Yes. I want to tell him about us.
And then, he's gonna leave you,

28:47.301 --> 28:50.930
[stutters] and you and I can get back
to making this work, okay?

28:51.013 --> 28:54.100
[stutters] This is the story
we're gonna tell our kids.

28:54.183 --> 28:57.186
"Your mom was dating a loser,
and I... I came after her.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.812
I chased after her." All right?

28:58.895 --> 29:01.732
This... this guy is a wimp.
He's not gonna fight for you.

29:01.815 --> 29:03.817
You want someone
who is gonna fight for you!

29:03.900 --> 29:07.029
No, Dustin, I don't. Please, I don't.

29:07.112 --> 29:10.449
You don't know
what the fuck you want, okay?

29:10.866 --> 29:12.118
I'm being direct with you.

29:12.201 --> 29:16.622
This fucking guy is not the answer
to your problems, okay?

29:16.705 --> 29:19.125
You need to have the courage
to stay in the game with me

29:19.208 --> 29:21.002
until we figure this out together.

29:21.085 --> 29:24.296
Dustin... just let me go.

29:24.380 --> 29:26.673
Maybe with Gus I can be happy.

29:29.385 --> 29:31.971
[chuckles] You're gonna destroy him.

29:32.054 --> 29:33.847
Maybe I will. Maybe.

29:33.930 --> 29:36.433
But let me figure that out
on my own, okay?

29:36.517 --> 29:39.895
If you love me,
you're gonna give me the space to do that.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.360
[doorknob rattling]

29:46.443 --> 29:48.154
[Gus] Hello? Mickey?

29:49.363 --> 29:50.697
[knocking on door]

29:50.781 --> 29:52.449
- [Gus] Mickey?
- [whispering] Can you...

29:52.533 --> 29:54.118
Can you just go out there, please?

29:58.289 --> 29:59.706
[knocking on door]

30:00.666 --> 30:01.958
[Gus] Mickey?

30:04.503 --> 30:06.547
- Hello?
- [knocks on door]

30:10.842 --> 30:13.095
- You there?
- [Mickey] I'm coming, Gus! Sorry!

30:14.721 --> 30:15.722
Sorry.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.017
- Um...
- Hey, what's up?

30:18.100 --> 30:20.436
Hi, I was in the bathroom
and I locked the door

30:20.519 --> 30:22.646
'cause I didn't want anyone
to be able to get in.

30:22.729 --> 30:25.857
Oh, it's okay. I don't trust anybody
around here. It's fine.

30:25.941 --> 30:27.693
Uh, hope you like Sprite.

30:27.776 --> 30:31.572
Oh, well, I'm...
I'm more of a 7 Up girl, actually.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.782
It's okay. They literally taste the same.

30:36.077 --> 30:37.411
Hey, you okay?

30:38.412 --> 30:40.039
I... I gotta tell you something.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.459
Okay. Let's talk.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.088
Uh, yeah, it's um...
It's... it's kinda scary to say.

30:48.672 --> 30:49.715
Look...

30:50.716 --> 30:52.801
I know I've been coming on strong.
It's just...

30:52.884 --> 30:55.512
I think when I got back,
I just got excited...

30:55.596 --> 30:57.889
No, it's not that.
Gus, it's not. It's...

30:58.807 --> 30:59.808
[sighs]

31:02.144 --> 31:04.355
[stutters] I wanna be
in a relationship with you.

[Beck's "True Love Will Find You
In The End" playing]

31:06.565 --> 31:09.401
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

31:09.485 --> 31:13.405
I don't wanna do
any more nonexclusive bullshit.

31:13.489 --> 31:14.990
That ends today.

31:15.074 --> 31:19.745
I wanna really try and work on this
and be in a real adult relationship.

31:22.873 --> 31:24.083
I want that, too.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.835
- Really?
- Of course.

31:28.754 --> 31:33.717
I'm in. Mickey, I'm in.
Let's... let's fucking be a couple.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.513
