00:08.100 --> 00:10.034
Noah:
Pre wous/y on
screa m. . .

00:15.680 --> 00:16.430
Oh, my god.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.769
Mom, whose ultrasound is this?

00:17.780 --> 00:21.272
Remember i told you
that your dad and i
were having problems?

00:21.280 --> 00:22.872
You should have
told me about this!

00:22.890 --> 00:25.450
Why?
Would you have wanted it?

00:25.450 --> 00:28.749
What if the child
that you gave up...

00:28.760 --> 00:29.488
Is back?

00:29.490 --> 00:32.550
Sometimes the guy next door
is worshiping the devil.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.619
Audrey: Hey, i think
there's something up there.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.427
Holy dexter's
air conditioner...

00:36.430 --> 00:39.399
We just got a hit on
mr. Branson's real identity.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.389
Now we call the sheriff.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.336
Seth branson used to be
seth palmer, when he
had this affair.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.409
But then she turned up dead.

00:45.410 --> 00:48.709
Put out an apb
on seth branson.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.007
Seth?

00:51.950 --> 00:53.269
(brooke screams)

00:53.280 --> 00:53.803
(pants)

00:53.820 --> 00:56.778
Seth branson! Don't move!
Let go of the girl.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.143
Take him in.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.640
(handcuffs click)

01:18.540 --> 01:21.338
(suspenseful music playing)

02:42.120 --> 02:43.883
P/jnen
Hey, guys.
It‘s piper shat/V,

02:43.890 --> 02:47.326
With a special halloween
podcast of
autopsy of a crime.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.627
So, in looking for
a connection

02:48.630 --> 02:51.861
Between the
ia/(ewooo' murders
past and present

02:51.870 --> 02:53.394
I had to wonder
about brandon ’s mask.

02:53.400 --> 02:58.235
Turns out, it disappeared
from county evidence
last year,

02:58.240 --> 02:59.662
But was never reported

02:59.680 --> 03:00.738
If i were sner/ﬁ‘nudson,

03:00.740 --> 03:03.903
I’d be loo/ring
into the chief suspects
whereabouts

03:03.910 --> 03:06.049
Around the time
the mask went missing.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.245
But even then,
whats seth branson is,

03:08.250 --> 03:12.380
Or rather seth pa/meris,
connection to brandonjames?

03:12.390 --> 03:16.781
Why become the monster
behind the mask?

03:18.130 --> 03:20.985
We found this knife
In your classroom.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.390
Any idea how it got there?

03:25.670 --> 03:26.125
No.

03:26.140 --> 03:29.928
It had traces
of will belmont's
blood on it.

03:30.140 --> 03:34.429
It's not my knife.

03:35.610 --> 03:38.249
Look, we know you're involved
in the webcam spying.

03:38.250 --> 03:43.370
With the evidence we have
and your assault
on brooke maddox...

03:43.620 --> 03:44.939
I wasn't trying
to hurt brooke.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.089
Because you cared
about her, right?

03:47.090 --> 03:49.684
Yeah, i... I got that.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.258
Just like you cared
about olivia findlay

03:53.260 --> 03:56.821
When your name
was seth palmer...

03:57.800 --> 04:00.564
And she was found murdered?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.737
I think i'm gonna
wait for my lawyer.

04:03.740 --> 04:06.061
Yeah, i thought you might.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.074
Emma: I'm just really glad
that you're okay.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.469
You must've been terrified.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.209
I was.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.371
I can't believe that seth
could do any of those things.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.381
Brooke, he's not
who we thought he was.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.812
He is literally
a different person.

04:20.820 --> 04:24.620
But that doesn't make
everything about him a lie.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.326
I wouldn't be so sure.

04:31.030 --> 04:32.895
Why didn't you ever tell me?

04:32.900 --> 04:34.128
Because i knew you
would get all judgy.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.098
Brooke, i am not judging you.
After everything
that we've been through,

04:37.110 --> 04:41.376
I just want to make sure
that you're actually
seeing this clearly.

04:41.380 --> 04:41.903
Are you?

04:41.910 --> 04:43.377
'cause after what
happened to will,

04:43.380 --> 04:45.507
It seems like you just need
to hold someone accountable.

04:45.510 --> 04:46.943
I do.

04:46.950 --> 04:51.341
But this isn't about me,
this is about all of us.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.118
Why do i feel so alone?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.582
Brooke, you're not.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.088
My mom's in rehab,

05:01.100 --> 05:02.556
My dad's in prison,

05:02.560 --> 05:07.623
My ex... Whatever-he-is
is being held for murder.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.993
(sighs)

05:09.000 --> 05:11.867
And now i have
to stay with jake.

05:11.870 --> 05:14.464
You know,
if jake drives you crazy...

05:14.480 --> 05:17.233
You can always
come and stay with me.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.000
(chuckles)

05:18.010 --> 05:20.899
I might actually
hold you to that.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.411
Hudson: Trick-or-treating
ends at sundown.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.844
For everyone's safety,
we ask no masks be worn.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.055
Also, this year's
halloween dance

05:29.060 --> 05:33.087
Will serve_ as a fundraiser
for the Victims' families.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.059
(stammers) you're really gonna
have the dance after
all of these murders?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.367
Miss shaw,
we share your concern,

05:38.370 --> 05:43.569
But we feel very confident
that we have our man
In custody.

05:43.570 --> 05:46.164
That's all. Thank you.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.705
Wow. Okay.

05:49.910 --> 05:50.706
Piper: Sheriff!

05:50.710 --> 05:54.669
I know this dance will be
irresistible to this killer,

05:54.680 --> 05:56.216
If it isn't seth branson.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.642
We'll have security on site.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.413
Having all these
kids in one place

05:59.420 --> 06:02.719
Is safer than trying to cover
a dozen house parties.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.913
You sound defensive.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.922
I'm just doing my
best to keep the peace.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.422
What are you doing?

06:20.010 --> 06:25.175
Sorry, my mom went
a little nuts at the
tommy bahama outlet.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.171
(sighs)

06:29.750 --> 06:31.718
(groans)

06:32.120 --> 06:34.782
(sighing) it's fine.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.982
Extra towels are here,
coconut water in the mini.

06:38.990 --> 06:42.619
Uh... Wi-fi password is
"thejakestopshere."

06:42.630 --> 06:45.360
(chuckles) 'course it is.

06:45.730 --> 06:46.469
How's the pain?

06:46.470 --> 06:49.997
Did you take the extra
vicodin the doctor gave you?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.898
Duh. (sighs)

06:52.880 --> 06:55.371
Well, let's see the damage.

06:55.610 --> 06:59.808
(inhales through teeth)
nice. Almost as good as mine.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.448
Hmm. Goodbye, arm modeling.

07:02.450 --> 07:03.075
I don't know.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.342
There's a hot
chick from
top chef
and tina fey.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.156
And they have nothing on you.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.087
Thanks.

07:12.090 --> 07:16.993
Okay. Well...
Mi casa es su casa.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.661
(sighs)

07:23.470 --> 07:24.630
And, hey, um... (sighs)

07:24.640 --> 07:28.428
Can i ask you a question,
if you promise not to get mad?

07:28.440 --> 07:30.772
I make no promises.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.543
(chuckles softly)

07:32.550 --> 07:34.973
Why'd you go back to him?

07:37.020 --> 07:39.147
(clears throat)
because i...

07:39.150 --> 07:42.950
_ Felt like
I had no one else.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.423
You had me.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.856
And fyi, if i ever caught
branson hurting you,

07:50.870 --> 07:52.758
He would be dead.

07:59.510 --> 08:00.568
Hey, mom.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.504
Hey!
Oh, thanks.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.442
So... (sighs)

08:05.450 --> 08:08.613
I've ordered a dna panel
on seth branson...

08:08.620 --> 08:10.838
And a maternity test for me.

08:10.850 --> 08:14.047
But the results
will take a few days.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.517
I know how hard that must be.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.327
I want it to be over.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.553
(inhales) mom?

08:23.970 --> 08:26.564
Mom, i need to
talk to branson.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.391
No, we need to let
clark do his job.
I can't wait.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.036
I am a witness.

08:33.040 --> 08:36.737
(inhales sharply)
if he did these
things to hurt us...

08:36.750 --> 08:42.245
(stammers) then he's gonna
have a reaction
when he sees me.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.645
I need to look
in hIS eyes.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.979
I need to know.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.241
Hello, emma.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.556
(breathing shakily)

09:25.160 --> 09:27.958
Hi, mr. Branson.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.855
What are you doing here?

09:29.870 --> 09:32.395
You know what i'm doing here.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.697
No,idont.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.396
They won't even tell
me if brooke's okay.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.139
She's fine.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.036
I know they're saying
a lot of terrible things...

09:43.050 --> 09:45.871
But i did not kill will.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.243
I don't even know
where that knife...

09:51.990 --> 09:54.379
I'm sorry, but my lawyer...
I...

09:54.390 --> 09:56.756
I can't talk about it.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.024
Mr. Branson... (scoffs)

09:59.230 --> 10:01.653
Whatever your name is...

10:01.660 --> 10:02.558
Okay, my friends are dead,

10:02.560 --> 10:06.792
My family has been targeted,
and you know why.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.928
(sighs) actually,
i don't, emma.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.601
(scoffs)

10:12.040 --> 10:12.734
What is this?

10:12.740 --> 10:15.379
What, do you guys
think i'm gonna have
some sort of, like, breakdown

10:15.380 --> 10:18.133
And confess everything
to one of m y students?

10:18.150 --> 10:20.209
He's not going for it.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.108
Give them a minute.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.214
Why are you lett/ng
him use you l/ke this?

10:25.220 --> 10:26.949
I asked to do this.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.178
Oh, really?

10:29.190 --> 10:31.624
Well, i'm a captive audience.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.655
Clearly, you have something
you want to say to me.

10:33.660 --> 10:37.653
Did you find out the truth
about who you are?

10:37.670 --> 10:40.798
Is that why you
came to lakewood?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.392
You mean why i
changed my name?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.732
Yeah, that's part of it.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.798
I can't talk
about my past, emma.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.906
(inhales deeply)
what about my mother?

10:52.910 --> 10:54.468
What about her?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.414
(scoffs)

10:57.620 --> 10:59.542
She's...

10:59.550 --> 11:01.211
Nice.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.083
You look a lot like her.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.219
(shuddering)

11:08.230 --> 11:11.119
You said that
this ends with me.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.332
So, is it over?

11:17.370 --> 11:20.908
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

11:20.910 --> 11:25.449
But considering that
i'm stuck in here...

11:25.650 --> 11:29.017
I guess you'll
find out soon enough.

11:30.450 --> 11:32.486
(inhales sharply)

11:35.560 --> 11:38.120
(shower running)

12:04.920 --> 12:06.387
(gasps)

12:13.160 --> 12:14.889
(sighs)

12:23.510 --> 12:25.262
Noah: Oh, my god.

12:25.270 --> 12:28.398
Branson? Is your...

12:28.940 --> 12:29.531
Oh, my god!

12:29.540 --> 12:31.235
Hey, can you just stop
saying that and help me?

12:31.250 --> 12:34.299
It's a lot to
take in, em, and...

12:34.320 --> 12:35.116
No offense,

12:35.120 --> 12:38.419
But you were just kind of
seeing will's ghost
around school.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.614
Okay, this is
not a delusion.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.612
Could we just go
back to the part
where your mom,

12:42.620 --> 12:45.885
Who wears cardigans
and drives an suv...

12:45.890 --> 12:48.427
Had a baby
with brandon james?

12:48.430 --> 12:49.192
We got it.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.519
The thing that i
could never figure out

12:50.530 --> 12:52.691
Was why this killer
was focusing on my family.

12:52.700 --> 12:57.262
But... I mean,
if mr. Branson is my family,

12:57.270 --> 12:58.806
Then all of this
makes sense.

12:58.810 --> 13:01.267
Well, what happened
when you sat across from him?

13:01.280 --> 13:04.204
I want the fava-bean-
by-fava-bean recap.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.746
Well, he played it
pretty cool.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.968
That's why i need
to know for sure.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.948
Noah: Brandon's son...

13:09.950 --> 13:10.712
Bran-son.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.838
He picked that name.
That redefines
"hiding in plain sight."

13:14.860 --> 13:18.557
There's still no connection
between branson and rachel.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.879
Maybe we just
haven't found it yet.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.893
The news reports don't even
mention her name when they
talk about the victims.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.460
It's like they forgot
that her suicide was staged.

13:26.470 --> 13:30.099
Look, audrey,
i know you want the truth.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.031
So let's find it.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.008
Let's just prove
it beyond a doubt.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.877
Bi-curious and _
the VIrgIn are on It.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.370
And the crime world trembled.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.302
Piper, hey!
Wow. Uh...

13:39.310 --> 13:41.278
We...
Were just leaving.

13:41.280 --> 13:41.939
Right, yes.

13:41.950 --> 13:44.839
And, you know,
just for the record,
totally not...

13:44.850 --> 13:47.341
Stop talking. Stop talking.
...A virgin. Okay.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.157
Go get 'em.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.515
Hey, piper.
Hey.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.327
So, it's a big day.
You must be relieved.

13:53.330 --> 13:57.118
The killer's behind bars,
life can go back to normal.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.119
It's huge.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.893
Then why do you
sound so disappointed?

13:59.900 --> 14:04.269
A lead i was following up on
didn't pan out
the way i hoped it would.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.864
What was the lead?
What was it?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.132
"it" was a "who."

14:09.140 --> 14:11.938
Cassie james,
brandon james' mom.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.771
Whoa. You found her?
Mmm-hmm.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.338
She changed her name,
but i traced her

14:16.350 --> 14:17.578
Through her
social security number.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.286
She's living right
outside of warren.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.211
Did you talk to her?

14:21.220 --> 14:25.657
Well, she rambled, mostly.
She's a little incoherent.

14:25.860 --> 14:26.986
I was just hoping
for an interview

14:27.000 --> 14:30.197
That would tie the past
and the present
murders together.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.819
But it was a long shot.
I had to see for myself,
you know?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.491
Yeah, i know.

14:38.310 --> 14:42.098
I think we might be able
to help each other out.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.274
Piper: Mrs. James...

14:45.280 --> 14:50.638
Emma would like to
ask you about brandon.
Is that okay?

14:51.320 --> 14:51.843
(sighs)

14:51.850 --> 14:56.059
You're just gonna
tell a monster story.
That's all they wanna hear.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.119
No, no. I'm not a reporter.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.348
My mother was your neighbor.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.397
She was friends with brandon.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.359
She told me that he
was very nice to her.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.794
Brandon was my
golden-years child.

15:11.810 --> 15:15.302
I was nearly 50
when i had him.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.101
Ed said the egg was old,

15:19.110 --> 15:21.874
And that's why
he had his issues.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.940
And that boy suffered so.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.838
(sighing)

15:27.390 --> 15:29.255
Your mom was...

15:29.260 --> 15:31.114
Daisy, the little blonde.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.486
Of course. Now i see
the resemblance, yes.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.822
(chuckling)

15:39.330 --> 15:41.469
I saw you outside,

15:41.470 --> 15:45.600
Trying to get up nerve
to come in and talk to me.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.676
Talk about what?

15:48.680 --> 15:50.568
Oh, you know.

15:51.050 --> 15:54.702
I kept brandon
home to keep him safe.

15:55.050 --> 15:56.938
He met you and he begged me

15:56.950 --> 16:00.579
To let him get a job
with the bowling alley.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.917
'cause you were sex.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.155
Walking and talking.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.958
He'd do anything for you.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.694
You got him killed.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.329
(stammering)
i... I didn't.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.296
Cassie: So much pain.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.098
Why did you take him from me?

16:19.110 --> 16:20.839
(inhales deeply) why, daisy?

16:20.840 --> 16:23.502
I'm so sorry, we shouldn't
have bothered you.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.944
(cassie singing)
daisy, daisy

16:25.950 --> 16:29.545
give me your answer, true

16:29.820 --> 16:32.118
Oh, he loved that song.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.283
He love...
And so did his boy.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.053
Loved that song.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.925
Whose boy, mrs. James?

16:38.930 --> 16:41.421
Brandon's. Brandon's son.

16:41.430 --> 16:44.126
He was here the other day.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.198
Just...

16:45.200 --> 16:46.428
Emma: Brando\r(1's son was here?
es.

16:46.430 --> 16:50.139
Oh, when was that?
Yeah, he was so handsome.

16:50.140 --> 16:53.507
Do you remember his name?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.429
Uh...

16:57.150 --> 16:59.300
Steve? No.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.743
Keith? No, no.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.014
Wait, was it seth?

17:03.320 --> 17:05.641
Yes, that's it. Seth.
That was it.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.447
Oh, he was so handsome.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.587
Just like
an old-time movie star.

17:09.590 --> 17:14.084
And he wanted to know
all about his daddy.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.454
(sighs)
yes.

17:16.460 --> 17:20.021
He wanted to know
all about brandon.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.830
Yes, daisy. Daisy...

17:26.440 --> 17:31.707
Emma: That was real, right?
She said that seth
is brandon's son.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.769
Well, it's never
gonna hold up in court,

17:33.780 --> 17:36.419
But yeah, that's...
That's what she said.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.810
(scoffs) well,
it's good enough for me.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.917
Thank you for doing this.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.219
Yeah. You deserve peace.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.586
(knocking at door)
it's open.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.579
Hi, stranger.

18:16.590 --> 18:17.113
Hey!

18:17.130 --> 18:19.223
You really shouldn't leave
your door unlocked.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.425
It's over. Didn't you hear?
They caught him.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.955
Yeah, it's great news.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.424
I really should've
called you back.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.537
You've had a lot on your mind.
I just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.098
Iam.

18:34.510 --> 18:36.432
I really am.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.307
Kieran... (sighs deeply)

18:41.320 --> 18:45.814
After what happened to will,
i couldn't risk...
I get it.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.117
I do.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.085
So where does this leave us?

18:52.690 --> 18:54.282
Well...

18:54.700 --> 18:58.898
I'd really like to
make up for lost time.

18:59.230 --> 19:01.391
I like the sound of that.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.964
Good.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.505
So, should we do
something to celebrate?

19:10.510 --> 19:15.106
(chuckles)
um, what did you
have in mind?

19:15.450 --> 19:21.685
I heard a rumor about
some kInd of
halloween dance or some such.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.419
You game?
Um...

19:23.420 --> 19:28.028
Only if we can shop
for awkward couple
costumes together.

19:28.030 --> 19:30.351
I see you're gonna
make me regret this.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.689
(chuckles)

19:31.700 --> 19:36.535
Hey, do you want
to come to dinner?
My mom's ordering pizza.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.634
I could eat.

19:45.950 --> 19:48.009
(inaudible)

20:01.160 --> 20:02.457
Noah: Any luck?

20:02.460 --> 20:03.859
Audrey: Maybe.
Listening...

20:03.870 --> 20:07.863
Okay, so rachel
practically lived
with her camera.

20:07.870 --> 20:09.337
I mean,
she documented everything.

20:09.340 --> 20:11.535
Coming from you,
that's kind of scary.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.199
(scoffs)

20:12.210 --> 20:14.599
When i was trying to make her
memorial video,

20:14.610 --> 20:16.009
I went_ to access
her Video files,

20:16.010 --> 20:17.329
But they'd all been wiped
from her computer.

20:17.350 --> 20:21.548
Interesting. Kinda like how
nina's spy-cam network just up
and disappeared.

20:21.550 --> 20:24.872
You think rachel
might have caught branson
doing something on tape?

20:24.890 --> 20:28.485
Well, i mean, it might explain
why he made it
look like a suicide.

20:28.490 --> 20:29.650
Wasn't part of the plan.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.412
It was cleaning up
loose ends.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.887
But... (sighs)
if all the footage
was deleted...

20:33.900 --> 20:36.892
Rachel backed
everything up to the cloud.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.988
And i have the password.

20:39.230 --> 20:42.836
Time for a raw
footage film festival.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.361
(unenthusiastically) yay!

20:47.040 --> 20:49.679
Picked up your
porsche for you.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.576
No scratches,
minor tread wear.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.400
Oh.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.072
What do we have here?

20:59.220 --> 20:59.811
Huh?

20:59.820 --> 21:04.917
We have a pervert
who was watching me
undress on my webcam.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.726
What?

21:05.730 --> 21:06.549
(sighs)
are you sure?

21:06.560 --> 21:09.723
Yeah, the light just turned on
all by itself.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.789
(sighs)

21:11.800 --> 21:13.199
Was it you?

21:13.200 --> 21:13.791
No.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.358
The network's
shut down, remember?

21:15.370 --> 21:16.837
Yeah, well,
someone was watching me.

21:16.840 --> 21:21.061
And considering
seth is behind bars,
i'm pretty sure it wasn't him.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.433
God, why do you
keep defending him?

21:22.440 --> 21:26.103
Because everyone
is making him out
to be some sort of monster.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.271
Yeah, and maybe he is.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.545
I don't believe that.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.676
And how do you know?

21:31.690 --> 21:35.046
You still think
you're the apex predator.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.857
Sometimes you have to
have faith in people.

21:36.860 --> 21:42.082
Yeah, and that is really
working out for you
and the fam, right?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.448
(chuckles)

21:44.470 --> 21:46.461
This was a mistake.

21:48.770 --> 21:52.228
Come on.
Where are you going?

21:53.210 --> 21:55.337
I'm going home.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.343
Great.

22:05.820 --> 22:09.187
Remember the burner phone
from branson's classroom?

22:09.190 --> 22:10.282
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

22:10.290 --> 22:13.555
I compared the call log
to emma's phone records.

22:13.560 --> 22:18.520
These white pins
are cell towers
the calls pinged.

22:18.830 --> 22:19.899
And?

22:19.900 --> 22:21.765
And they all originated here.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.067
The southern
edge of wren lake.

22:23.070 --> 22:26.267
Far from branson's
house and the school.

22:26.270 --> 22:28.738
His lawyers will
be all over that.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.002
Yeah.

22:30.010 --> 22:33.741
I could really use
a witness tying
him to these calls.

22:33.750 --> 22:38.312
That part of the lake's
pretty quiet after
the summer season's over.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.119
Yeah.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.117
I'm gonna knock on doors.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.350
See if i can find
someone who can id him.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.225
Don't you have
deputies for that?

22:46.230 --> 22:49.051
Maybe i'm doing some penance.

22:49.800 --> 22:54.863
Well... There's not
gonna be another
riley marra on my watch.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.881
Hello?

23:50.260 --> 23:52.182
Anyone home?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.136
Terry, can you
run a plate for me?

24:03.140 --> 24:04.368
Terry: (over radio)
go ahead.

24:04.370 --> 24:08.830
Three, union, foxtrot, hotel,
eight, seven, two.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.432
Copy that.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.122
Sheriff's department.
Anyone here?

24:49.850 --> 24:51.943
(computer chimes)

24:59.890 --> 25:02.757
(suspenseful music playing)

25:20.250 --> 25:22.468
(rattling)

25:29.190 --> 25:31.215
Sheriff's department!

25:33.260 --> 25:35.285
Anyone home?

25:42.700 --> 25:44.634
(floor creaking)

25:47.840 --> 25:50.536
(pop music playing)

25:55.180 --> 25:56.977
(cell phone chimes)

26:09.530 --> 26:11.225
(typing)

26:21.640 --> 26:23.505
(cell phone ringing)

26:24.780 --> 26:26.247
Hey, brooke. What's up?

26:26.250 --> 26:27.808
Hey, change of plans.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.517
Party at my place.
I'm getting the good stuff.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.340
Wait i thought you were going
to the dance.

26:33.350 --> 26:38.481
(sighs) dude, in a rec center
with no booze and
wall-to-wall cops?

26:38.490 --> 26:39.149
It's gonna blow.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.684
Well, i told kieran
i'd meet him there,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.759
But maybe we can
come to yours after?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.091
He’s, uh, not picking you up?

26:44.100 --> 26:46.660
Uh, no, he had
something he had to do.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.319
Hmm. Well, that's lame.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.390
But hey,
considering my ex-beau
may be a mass murderer,

26:52.410 --> 26:53.229
Who am i to criticize?

26:53.240 --> 26:56.437
Wait, brooke, are you okay?
Did something
happen with jake?

26:56.440 --> 26:59.568
No, i just remembered
who i am.

26:59.580 --> 27:02.344
I have a reputation to uphold.

27:02.350 --> 27:03.612
And i'm done being the victim.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.111
Good. Kieran and i wﬂl
definitely be there.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.817
I’ll text you from the dance.
Bye.

27:13.390 --> 27:14.755
Noah: Never thought
the life and times

27:14.760 --> 27:17.991
Of a sexually-confused
catholic girl
could be so dry.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.798
You wanna feel the sting
of this
sexually-confused atheist's

27:20.800 --> 27:23.166
Foot up your butt?
Hey, hey!

27:23.170 --> 27:24.990
I made you
microwave popcorn, okay?

27:25.010 --> 27:27.035
Uh-huh. (chuckles)

27:27.540 --> 27:28.165
Where is that?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.034
Oh, it's a bar
on eighth street.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.975
Rachel loved sneaking in there
with her hidden camera.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.073
She got so much free drama.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.048
(chuckles) fights, flirts,

27:37.050 --> 27:41.384
Old men swapping stories
from the bottom of a bottle.

27:43.790 --> 27:46.156
Rachel loved all of it.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.089
I know how much you miss her.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.891
(sighs) yeah.

27:52.600 --> 27:58.163
Rachel might be gone,
but i'm going to make sure
she is never forgotten.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.107
Oh, crap. I gotta set up.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.609
Yeah, i better change.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.806
Hold on.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.402
What?

28:10.350 --> 28:12.079
Is that nina?

28:13.050 --> 28:15.018
And that's kieran.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.421
What the hell?

28:23.430 --> 28:25.990
(dance music playing)

28:40.010 --> 28:42.717
Brooke, where are you?

28:55.230 --> 28:59.098
Noah: (as dracula)
come into the l/ght
my ch/ldren/

28:59.100 --> 29:01.796
(cackles)

29:01.800 --> 29:04.394
Let me hear you scream!

29:04.410 --> 29:06.731
(crowd cheering)

29:21.260 --> 29:23.911
Hey, mom.
How's chaperone duty?

29:23.920 --> 29:27.651
Uneventful,
just the way i like it.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.555
Wait, where's clark?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.254
I don't know.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.797
He's not returning my texts.
Must've gotten hung up.

29:32.800 --> 29:38.329
Well, that seems
to run in the family.
Kieran is also very late.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.639
Mrs. D, looking lovely,
as always.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.265
Jake.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.238
One non-alcoholic drink,
por favor.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.603
Okay.

29:47.010 --> 29:47.840
Emma: What did you do?

29:47.850 --> 29:49.203
You talked to brooke.
Yes, i did.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.109
She was at your
house for half a day.
What did you say to her?

29:52.120 --> 29:54.315
I don't know.
Some jake-ass thing.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.981
Well, she's not coming.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.457
What?

29:57.460 --> 30:00.657
_ Iwore this
stupid costume for her.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.952
She's having an after-party.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.361
Thank god, 'cause this
drink is undrinkable.

30:10.370 --> 30:11.291
Noah: (as dracula) ah, yes.

30:11.310 --> 30:16.373
A, uh, proper steampunk lady
with a soupcon of goth.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.002
And you're
a master of ceremonies?

30:18.010 --> 30:21.707
I was gonna be the babadook,
but then my mom
made this cape.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.641
I couldn't break her heart.

30:22.650 --> 30:25.312
That's so cute.
Yeah, well...

30:30.020 --> 30:32.352
I should tell
emma about kieran.

30:32.360 --> 30:36.194
What? No, but mr. Branson
has to be the killer, right?

30:36.200 --> 30:38.896
I mean, i led the cops
to their best evidence.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.391
Kieran was leaving
a bar with nina.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.460
Then nina got dead.
And he saw rachel filming him.

30:44.470 --> 30:47.564
Yes, but we can't leap
to conclusions like this.

30:47.580 --> 30:52.005
Yeah, kieran comes across
a little mysterious,
but he saved my life.

30:52.010 --> 30:52.578
He's nice.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.468
A stranger whose parents
died mysteriously,

30:54.480 --> 30:56.038
And who was at a bar
with the first victim

30:56.050 --> 30:59.508
And who seduced
our young ingenue,
the killer's obsessed with.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.647
You mean that kind of nice?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.853
(suspenseful music playing)

31:11.230 --> 31:13.266
Gotta warn emma.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.398
Noah!
VVhat?

31:16.400 --> 31:20.006
He's not gonna kill her
during the dance sequence.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.204
Sorry i'm late.

31:26.210 --> 31:29.577
This look was
deceptively tricky
to put together.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.218
Well, you're rocking it.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.812
Let's do this.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.209
(rock and roll music playing)

32:04.420 --> 32:06.843
Hey, maggie.
Hey.

32:06.850 --> 32:07.987
Two, please.

32:07.990 --> 32:09.912
Oh, okay.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.818
Everything okay?

32:13.160 --> 32:15.720
Yeah. I've been
calling your dad.

32:15.730 --> 32:16.822
He should be here by now.

32:16.830 --> 32:19.424
Yeah, he's not so great
with the technology.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.489
(maggie chuckles lightly)

32:22.370 --> 32:23.928
I can try him if you want.

32:23.940 --> 32:27.307
Would you? Thanks.
Yeah.

32:44.020 --> 32:48.684
Hey, you guys were great.
Extremely retro.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.849
(chuckles) thank you.

32:49.860 --> 32:52.090
Oh, i'm sorry that
i didn't call you yesterday.

32:52.100 --> 32:56.969
Actually, uh,
now's probably a
really good time to catch up.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.294
What's wrong?

32:58.310 --> 33:01.199
I went through
rachel's raw footage,
a lot of it,

33:01.210 --> 33:03.735
Trying to find
a connection to branson.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.002
And did you?

33:05.010 --> 33:06.500
No.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.375
I found something else.

33:20.660 --> 33:22.321
What is this?

33:22.330 --> 33:24.594
Nina and kieran, yeah.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.068
Rachel shot that.
Kieran saw her do it.

33:27.070 --> 33:30.267
Em, if she was
the only witness
to see him with nina...

33:30.270 --> 33:34.206
Audrey, mr. Branson
is the killer, okay?

33:34.210 --> 33:36.838
The dna is gonna prove that.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.742
Kieran and nina
were at a bar together,
so what?

33:40.750 --> 33:43.310
The night before she died.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.618
Emma, you can't trust him.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.651
Why not? I trusted you.

33:50.660 --> 33:55.256
We've all been caught on tape
doing things that look bad.

33:55.260 --> 33:57.057
Hey.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.152
Looking good.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.320
Yeah, you too.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.134
Did i do something
to upset audrey?

34:09.140 --> 34:13.349
No, she's just
being over-protective.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.204
Of you, with me?

34:15.220 --> 34:17.472
(sighs)

34:17.680 --> 34:19.477
What's going on, emma?

34:19.490 --> 34:25.087
She was going through
rachel's footage, looking for
a connection to branson.

34:25.090 --> 34:29.527
Yeah? My dad's been trying
to fill in those same blanks.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.325
Well, she found something.

34:33.870 --> 34:39.399
It was a video of
you and nina at a bar.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.705
Oh.

34:43.680 --> 34:47.241
Why didn't you tell
me that you knew her?

34:53.020 --> 34:53.884
I don't know her, okay?

34:53.890 --> 34:56.688
I met her once.
She didn't even
tell me her name.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.716
It was right before
i started at school.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.187
My dad and i got
in this epic fight

35:02.200 --> 35:04.657
(stutters) and
i went to a bar.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.468
(suspenseful music playing)

35:09.570 --> 35:12.562
She was beaut/fu/ and bored.

35:14.370 --> 35:16.201
A little drunk.

35:19.280 --> 35:19.905
We talked.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.572
She was insecure
and trying too hard.

35:22.580 --> 35:25.970
She said she was 23.
She worked in it.

35:25.990 --> 35:28.879
(chuckles softly) yeah.
That was her bar story.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.084
Yeah, see?
You know her m.O.

35:30.090 --> 35:34.652
Yeah, and i know that that
story usually ended with her
going home with the guy.

35:34.660 --> 35:38.596
Kieran:
I asked ifi could
call her a cab.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.964
But she kept Insist/ng
that she was
gonna drive herself

35:46.240 --> 35:48.663
So i drove her home.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.270
When we got there,
she wanted me to come in.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.441
I... I didn't.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.945
And then she was murdered.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.043
I... I am sorry.

36:00.050 --> 36:04.180
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell
me or anyone else.

36:04.190 --> 36:05.009
I should have.

36:05.030 --> 36:09.319
But i didn't
have any information
that would've helped.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.495
It was a no-win situation.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.967
(sighs)

36:13.970 --> 36:17.030
I really wanna believe you.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.989
But you don't?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.277
(sighs)
you know what?

36:23.280 --> 36:27.671
If you can't hear
me and trust me...

36:28.080 --> 36:30.116
Then branson won.

36:30.720 --> 36:35.384
Even sitting in his jail cell,
he beat you.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.504
Hey, are you okay?
Where's kieran?

36:55.510 --> 36:58.331
He left.
I messed things up royally.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.409
Or maybe he left
because he did it.

37:00.410 --> 37:04.744
Audrey, i know
that you want
justice for rachel...

37:04.750 --> 37:05.910
Yeah, i do.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.378
And he is
the only person i know of
who would've wanted her gone.

37:09.390 --> 37:12.655
So you want me to believe
that he killed everyone else?

37:12.660 --> 37:14.821
Nina, tyler, riley...

37:14.830 --> 37:16.525
And will.

37:17.730 --> 37:20.995
Audrey, i can't
believe that he did this

37:21.000 --> 37:25.039
Any more than i could believe
that you killed nina.

37:25.040 --> 37:29.101
Then i guess we'll have
to agree to disagree
on this one.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.938
You two have fun together.

37:30.940 --> 37:34.273
I'm crashing brooke's
and getting drunk!

37:36.750 --> 37:38.342
(sighs)

37:39.520 --> 37:42.717
(both laugh)

37:42.920 --> 37:46.720
They always fall
for the costume flask.

37:46.930 --> 37:49.751
You're a lot smarter
than you look.

37:50.300 --> 37:53.224
I bet you are, too, andrea.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.629
Ava .

37:54.640 --> 37:55.299
Ava .

37:55.300 --> 37:58.758
(chuckles)
are you going to
brooke's after this?

37:58.970 --> 38:00.403
I don't know.

38:00.410 --> 38:03.106
Do you wanna be my arm candy?

38:04.010 --> 38:06.103
They are nice arms.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.369
(both laugh)

38:13.450 --> 38:16.442
You ever been
inside a behemoth?

38:23.330 --> 38:25.491
Emma.
Piper, what are you
doing here?

38:25.500 --> 38:27.764
Hey, i'm so sorry to crash,
it's just that...

38:27.770 --> 38:28.668
(breathes heavily)

38:28.670 --> 38:31.491
Something cassie said
yesterday struck me as weird.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.535
So, i just, i went back today.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.804
Is she okay?
Yeah, it's just...

38:35.810 --> 38:38.574
(sighs)
i wanted to be
sure about branson,

38:38.580 --> 38:41.549
So i took the school yearbook
and i showed her his picture,

38:41.550 --> 38:44.849
And that's not
who came to see her.

38:44.850 --> 38:47.444
Okay, so who did?

38:47.920 --> 38:50.514
I showed her some
shots from the vigil,

38:50.520 --> 38:53.284
And she pointed out kieran.

38:55.260 --> 38:56.727
Is he still here?

38:56.730 --> 38:59.528
(breathes heavily) no, he...

38:59.800 --> 39:00.869
He just left.

39:00.870 --> 39:02.861
Then we better find him.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.997
(everyone screaming)

39:05.210 --> 39:07.269
Boy: What's going on?

39:08.740 --> 39:10.674
(electricity humming)

39:10.910 --> 39:13.777
(screaming continues)

39:15.020 --> 39:18.478
Girl: Oh, my god!
Is that sheriff hudson?

39:21.390 --> 39:22.948
(gasps)

39:22.960 --> 39:26.657
(grunting and
breathing heavily)

39:27.230 --> 39:29.221
(all clamoring)

39:33.370 --> 39:37.238
(officer on radio)
this is an all-points bulletin
for an escaped prisoner,

39:37.240 --> 39:39.765
Seth branson from the
lakewood city ja/l.

39:39.770 --> 39:41.408
He is armed and dangerous.

39:41.410 --> 39:43.799
Repeat this is
an apb for seth branson

39:43.810 --> 39:46.438
Who has escaped
from the lakewood city ja/l.

39:46.450 --> 39:49.248
He is armed and dangerous.

39:52.790 --> 39:55.350
(theme music playing)
