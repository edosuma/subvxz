WEBVTT

00:35.827 --> 00:37.120
This is Inspector Loftus.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.624
Sorry, I can't get to the phone.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.543
What's up with you?

00:42.626 --> 00:45.212
Well, you don't expect
to be ghosted by a Garda inspector.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.006
-I thought you were meeting this morning.
-Didn't show up.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.342
Left me standing outside
Dundrum shopping center like a loser.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.556
Maybe just stop calling him.
He's not that into you.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.561
So, youngest sister. I googled her.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.605
Wine surgically attached.
Different lad in every photo.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.191
Goes to tampon protests.
Floaty, that kind of vibe.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.569
I just don't know what we achieve
hassling this woman.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.822
We might be able to spook her into telling
us something the others wouldn't.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.449
And it's her time.

01:15.701 --> 01:16.702
Creep.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.188
So, when you're talking to her,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.940
focus on the lawyer's giveaways,
which are?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.902
-Matt.
-What?

01:49.985 --> 01:53.071
Refusal to name the victim directly.
Convoluted sentences.

01:53.572 --> 01:54.489
Jesus.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.952
Why are you taking that stuff
like it's your job? You all right?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.537
My esophagus is on fire.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.331
Like a shit dragon.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.832
Here.

02:03.916 --> 02:07.336
After this, I need you to go to
the pub where JP was the night he died.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.045
-Why?
-Sniff around.

02:09.128 --> 02:13.091
Flirt with the barmaid. Find out
what JP did, who he talked to, okay?

02:13.175 --> 02:14.801
-Fine.
-No! Goddamn!

02:15.719 --> 02:17.221
Come on!

02:17.304 --> 02:20.265
Geez, man. You're becoming zero craic
in all of this, you know that?

02:20.349 --> 02:22.893
-What flat number's she?
-It's open.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.065
Here. This could be him.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.108
Shit. Here. It's Theresa.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.528
Here. You take the lead in this.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.697
You all right, darling?

02:35.781 --> 02:37.950
Yeah, is it important?
Just because we've--

02:39.284 --> 02:41.537
Mayonnaise? Well…

02:43.747 --> 02:45.332
Just because it's not in the room
doesn't mean--

02:46.875 --> 02:48.043
It's in the fridge.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.589
I'll bring it up later. I need to go.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.634
-You're not at the gym.
-Of course.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.178
Is this a surprise?
Are you jetting me to Paris or something?

02:58.262 --> 02:59.888
Becka. Garvey.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.890
Sorry. I had to take a call.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.059
Thomas Claffin, Claffin Insurance.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.686
Rebecca Garvey, I presume?

03:08.272 --> 03:09.773
The insurance brothers?

03:09.857 --> 03:12.067
We can come back
if now isn't convenient, Ms. Garvey.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.028
A few questions about your
brother-in-law's death. Won't take long.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.161
-We're so sorry for your loss, Ms. Garvey.
-Thanks.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.746
-Matt, would you like to--
-No.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.999
Shit.

04:51.083 --> 04:54.920
As you know, we're just crossing the T's
and dotting the I's on John Paul's claim,

04:55.003 --> 04:58.924
making sure your sister, Grace,
gets what she deserves.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.639
So, were you close to the deceased?

05:07.766 --> 05:08.767
He was--

05:09.309 --> 05:10.644
I mean, we weren't…

05:13.313 --> 05:14.314
He was nice.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.399
Was he?

05:17.401 --> 05:19.820
Your sisters said something different.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.154
Washing the floors?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.911
-What did they say?
-"He's a prick." "He's a pleasure."

05:27.995 --> 05:30.455
-Now, which is it, Rebecca?
-Yeah. Which is it, Rebecca?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.791
Becka.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.171
I mean, you know families. They're…

05:37.254 --> 05:38.338
What?

05:40.632 --> 05:41.717
Complex.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.677
So, massage?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.929
-What about it?
-Does it keep you busy?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.140
Yeah, I've got my hands full.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.730
-Do you operate out of your own studio?
-Not at the moment.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.941
No? Are your family
not supportive of your massage work?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.193
Yes.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.738
Yeah, but you don't have your own studio.
You just-- What? You bring people here?

06:02.821 --> 06:03.822
All right, now, hang on.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.741
Have you ever been
in financial difficulty, Ms. Garvey?

06:05.824 --> 06:08.452
-Haven't we all?
-Could you not ask your sisters for help?

06:08.535 --> 06:11.788
-Well, you can't always rely on people.
-That's true. That's very true.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.750
But all those nice houses
and no one could give you a hand?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.669
You need to go. I have a client,
and you don't have a right to be here,

06:17.753 --> 06:19.087
-so I need you to go.
-Yep.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.507
-Don't leave the country, Ms. Garvey.
-I'll do what I want.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.383
Yeah, on your own head be it.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.470
Thanks for your time.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.391
Bloody hell, Matt.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.435
Hey. I didn't know you had that in you.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.896
You really got her rattled.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.023
Good-looking girl. Stunning eyes.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.276
Cold, though. Like a lizard.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.653
I have…

06:42.736 --> 06:43.779
Shit!

06:44.279 --> 06:45.280
…something to tell you.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.200
I know her. Becka Garvey.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.494
We were seeing each other.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.624
What? Is she the one
that keeps calling and texting you?

06:55.707 --> 06:56.708
Yeah.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.002
That's how you knew
about her money problems?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.379
She said her family let her down.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.548
That could've been JP.
Maybe JP promised and let her down.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.299
I don't know, all right? She lost a lot.

07:04.383 --> 07:07.719
Yeah, which would give her…
motive, Matthew!

07:07.803 --> 07:11.223
No, I don't want to talk about it,
all right? It's done. We're done.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.141
-Okay-- Is she--
-It's none of my business, Tom.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.601
Hey, hey, hey.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.770
Fuck!

07:18.647 --> 07:19.648
Shit!

07:24.111 --> 07:26.154
Will you slow down a bit?

07:26.238 --> 07:27.531
Why won't you answer me?

07:27.614 --> 07:31.118
I don't wanna talk about
John Paul anymore, okay? It's enough.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.244
We have to.

07:32.744 --> 07:36.373
Oscar's dead, Bibi.
And he did nothing wrong.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.333
He was a good dog.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.086
He had a permanent hard-on,
and he pissed everywhere.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.880
Yeah, around you, you scary bitch.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.259
Can it breathe in there?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.552
Yeah, think so.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.179
Hello.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.141
Yeah, a kitten
will make everyone happy again.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.225
Yeah, not JP.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.561
Did Urs text you back?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.732
-No.
-No?

08:02.441 --> 08:04.318
That's not like her. Give her a call.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.866
-What have you told Becka?
-Nothing.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.410
I'm not gonna tell her anything either.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.412
Don't want her involved.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.206
Yeah, of course. She'd fuck it up.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.125
-No answer.
-Not because she'll fuck it up.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.919
Because she wouldn't be able to handle it.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.130
Could we speed it up?

08:25.214 --> 08:27.424
I mean, my heart has stopped
from going so slow.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.927
What? I thought we were going on a stroll.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.096
I thought it was a stroll. Bibi.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.849
Come on, you lazy bitch.
We'll be late!

08:35.933 --> 08:36.933
Gonna get the car.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.855
So, each therapist
will be shadowed by a trainee

08:41.938 --> 08:44.525
that will essentially be paying
that therapist's wage,

08:45.275 --> 08:46.610
through their training fees.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.321
Fresh out of the oven. Sorry.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.533
I've worked it all out and
we'd agree to a rate of interest.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.951
Beat the bank sort of thing.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.119
The ones on the bottom
have apricots in them.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.081
-Thanks, Grace.
-We are working here, love.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.374
-Thank you.
-Sorry.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.712
So, my financial ask
is actually very modest,

09:05.796 --> 09:08.924
especially for a space like that
in a location like that.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.843
So you're finally growing up.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.888
Yeah. Well, I know that everybody thinks
that I'm the family screwup,

09:14.972 --> 09:18.475
but I'm doing it. And I've got a website
that's almost ready to go.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.561
And all of my reviews are so good.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.021
Well, they're mainly good.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.567
-And I had time to help your mom.
-What?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.236
Yeah. It's no trouble.
Her hip's actually improving.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.281
But we've got a professional on call.

09:33.156 --> 09:36.618
-Well, it's a pleasure to help.
-You need to focus on your premises.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.161
You're going to be busy.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.913
-Are you saying--
-What is that quote?

09:39.997 --> 09:43.166
"As long as you're going
to be thinking anyway, think big."

09:43.250 --> 09:46.211
-Are you thinking big?
-Yes! So…

09:46.295 --> 09:48.338
-So?
-Are you in?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.924
-I'm on board. Yeah, you know.
-That is so good.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.635
This is so exciting.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.637
Yay!

09:57.055 --> 09:59.433
-Oh, my God. Cute. Quick!
-We knew you had to be together.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.018
Look what they brought me.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.686
Look at you!

10:02.769 --> 10:04.938
She's from all her aunties.
We just thought,

10:05.022 --> 10:07.357
-after what happened with Oscar--
-Hang on a second.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.651
-It'd be nice to be asked.
-You can't just come wal--

10:09.735 --> 10:14.406
Cats are a walk in the park, JP.
They look after themselves.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.034
Can we, John, please?
Look at his paws.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.786
-Please, Daddy. Please?
-You can keep him.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.622
You're so cute.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.373
-Thanks, Dad.
-Hey!

10:24.458 --> 10:26.793
Thanks, Auntie Eva and Bibi.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.504
And Auntie Becka.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.839
I'm off for my run, finally.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.716
Never exercise with the elderly.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.010
Oi! Watch it.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.512
Bye.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.431
-I'll catch up with you soon.
-Thanks, darling.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.352
I'm gonna call him Harry
after Harry Styles.

10:43.435 --> 10:46.813
Come on. Come on in to your new home.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.191
Yeah. Come on, Harry.

10:53.737 --> 10:57.533
Your youngest sister was in there,
on her knees, begging me for money.

10:57.616 --> 11:01.203
Meanwhile, you're out here, splashing
cash on kittens nobody's asked for.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.247
Kitten cost nine euro.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.998
See you at the work quiz, Eva.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.583
Cannot wait.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.503
Take it seriously
if you want Gerald to take you seriously.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.548
At least give me a fair fight
for the promotion, will you?

11:14.424 --> 11:15.425
Cock.

11:19.930 --> 11:20.931
Leave it.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.976
JP again. Jesus.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.353
-What does he want?
-Don't know,

11:26.436 --> 11:28.856
but I know I have no time
for his shite tonight.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.232
All right. See you in the morning.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.151
-Bye, kids.
-Bye.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.195
-Love you.
-Love you too.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.280
Okay, so…

11:42.953 --> 11:43.996
It's Roger.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.130
For God's sake.

11:56.258 --> 11:59.178
Hope you don't mind me
coming around this way. It was-- I guess--

11:59.261 --> 12:01.638
I don't think JP heard me
knocking the door.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.308
-That stinks.
-Razor clams.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.935
Not the prettiest name in the world,
but I hope you enjoy them.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.770
You're very good, Roger.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.564
Becka, tell him your news.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.525
-I'm opening a massage studio.
-Congratulations.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.696
Tell you what? You could have Gracie
front the house with her lovely manners.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.074
What is this?

12:21.158 --> 12:23.702
We're just telling Roger
about your investment.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.621
It's actually not a bad idea, Grace.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.624
I haven't worked anywhere in yonks.
I wouldn't know the jargon.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.042
There's no jargon.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.461
Just welcome the people.
Manage the appointments.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.588
You'd be amazing, Grace. Amazing Grace.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.590
Like the song.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.674
I don't know.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.177
What do you think, John Paul?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.138
Grace runs our home.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.351
Right. Well, I'll leave yous lads to it.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.479
I'm heading off for a residential weekend
with my wee church group.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.522
Have fun.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.233
-Thank you.
-Thanks for the razors, Roger.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.317
Sure.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.092
I got a medical journal
from the library,

14:02.176 --> 14:05.846
and apparently, if you cut the aorta,
you'll be done within 90 seconds, so--

14:05.929 --> 14:10.392
Jesus Christ, Bibi. I don't wanna hear
the ins and outs of garroting someone.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.852
Why?

14:11.935 --> 14:15.022
Why? Because it's not happening, okay?

14:15.105 --> 14:18.817
It was one moment of madness.
Two moments of madness.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.403
And that's it. It's over. It's done.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.030
Right, Urs?

14:24.406 --> 14:25.407
Urs?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.452
I was just saying this whole thing
with John Paul, it--

14:28.535 --> 14:30.245
Jesus Christ! Just stop talking about him.

14:30.329 --> 14:32.789
I don't wanna hear his name anymore,
all right?

14:32.873 --> 14:37.169
And I can't believe I'm an accomplice
to an attempted murder, and for what?

14:37.252 --> 14:39.171
-Your CV.
-Oh, fuck off, Bibi.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.798
Let's take it back
to the old-school, lads!

14:45.260 --> 14:48.514
You've already started.
Didn't know we were meeting up.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.265
-Rude.
-Oh, no. It's not like that.

14:50.349 --> 14:52.309
Bibi was just waiting for Nora,
and Urs is--

14:52.392 --> 14:55.938
Well, I wanted your opinion
on paint swatches because…

14:57.731 --> 14:59.816
I just signed the lease on my studio!

15:03.654 --> 15:05.989
-Hello?
-Right. So JP's given you the loan?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.325
Yeah. He believes I can do this.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.035
Well, go talk paint with him then.

15:12.454 --> 15:17.042
You know what? I'm confused as to why I'm
getting more support from JP than you lot.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.169
-Do you not believe in me?
-Yeah, we do--

15:19.253 --> 15:20.379
Then what's this?

15:20.921 --> 15:22.256
Secret craic without me?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.424
Buying Blanaid sneaky kittens?

15:24.508 --> 15:26.844
We're just concerned that
you're taking too much from him, okay?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.011
Because he can be very…

15:28.095 --> 15:29.555
-Evil.
-…unreliable.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.931
You know, I like the pink.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.308
It's more your color,
and it will suit your skin tone.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.143
-Your piggy skin tone.
-Piss off, Bibi.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.688
Can you just stop?
Just stop, okay. Let's celebrate.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.816
Let's just celebrate the-- your business.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.277
Good? And the studio.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.864
-And you.
-To the business and Becka.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.032
-Business and Becka. Sláinte.
-Sláinte.

15:49.116 --> 15:53.161
Urs, you're, like, deadly quiet.
It's giving me the creeps.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.455
I'm not quiet. I'm hormonal.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.418
I'm up for having fun and sisterly chats.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.670
And drinking. I'm up for drinking.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.716
So go on then. Hit me with it.
What's the craic? What's the goss, huh?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.968
Are you going to shag your man?

16:09.511 --> 16:10.929
-What?
-Gabriel.

16:11.013 --> 16:14.766
I don't know.
It's hard to gauge the signals.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.852
What signals? Just shag him, Eva.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.646
-Yeah, 'cause it's that easy, isn't it?
-It literally is.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.982
You're a ride. You deserve to get ridden.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.358
Let Gabriel ride you.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.986
-I'm going.
-That's my--

16:26.069 --> 16:27.696
That's actually real champagne, Becka.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.657
You leave me out of everything,
I take your champagne.

16:30.741 --> 16:31.992
Quid pro quo.

16:32.618 --> 16:33.994
Well, look. Don't be like--

16:34.870 --> 16:35.954
Becka.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.254
What do you think, should I?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.840
-Ride him?
-No, ask him out.

16:46.924 --> 16:48.550
-Probably not.
-Why?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.929
Oh, God, thanks for the pep talk.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.019
Thank you, fine sir!

17:28.757 --> 17:29.842
Coming!

17:33.303 --> 17:36.807
And this photo's John Paul
when he was just 12 years old.

17:36.890 --> 17:37.891
With his frog.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.853
John Paul loved frogs.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.856
He'd give them names,
then drown them in milk.

17:44.690 --> 17:49.570
I found seven different glasses of milk
with dead frogs under his bed.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.739
George.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.784
He didn't stuff amphibians, you see.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.828
He thought the frogs were vulgar.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.124
But your brother, he loved frogs, Laura.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.542
It's Becka.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.422
Is this Laura?

18:09.006 --> 18:11.258
Sorry. This is my daughter.

18:11.884 --> 18:14.428
They're her best dungarees.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.680
And her cat, Miso.

18:18.223 --> 18:19.808
But she's gone now.

18:23.687 --> 18:26.732
Is she coming back? Like George.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.736
I'm afraid Laura is not coming back.

18:33.697 --> 18:34.907
I'm sorry, Minna.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.286
I have to piss like a Russian racehorse.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.590
What the hell, JP?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.927
This is how you run your sessions?

18:56.011 --> 18:57.846
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

18:58.597 --> 18:59.598
JP.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.226
Looks like a lovely afternoon.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.603
I know you said that
she already has a physio, but I just--

19:04.686 --> 19:07.481
Yeah, it's no problem. I just
don't want to pay for the care twice.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.359
We were just chatting.
I love coming to see her.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.486
Me too.

19:14.446 --> 19:15.656
I'll leave you to it.

19:21.787 --> 19:22.996
Bye, Min!

19:29.419 --> 19:30.879
For Christ's sake.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.061
Look.

19:53.402 --> 19:57.030
"Gin later?"
"Does anybody have ibuprofen?"

19:57.114 --> 19:58.782
"I'm hemorrhaging here."

19:58.866 --> 20:00.200
Hemorrhaging?

20:00.284 --> 20:02.077
Jesus, you girls need a priest.

20:02.160 --> 20:06.206
Do you ever talk about novels? Politics?

20:06.290 --> 20:08.709
You need to be on it, Grace, for the quiz.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.753
Periods and gin isn't going to cut it.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.381
I will be. It's just sister chat.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.509
I know we're a bit much sometimes.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.263
Becka's the happiest I've seen her
in a long while.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.934
She won't let you down. She'll pay
the cash back in no time like she said.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.228
I can't give Becka money.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.232
What?

20:33.692 --> 20:35.986
-Why not?
-Well, I never said I would.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.447
She must have misunderstood.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.908
I mean, she needs to build her own life,
doesn't she?

20:40.991 --> 20:42.075
But I thought you…

20:43.619 --> 20:44.828
You said--

20:45.412 --> 20:46.663
She signed the lease, JP.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.665
Well, she must have got help
somewhere else.

20:48.749 --> 20:52.628
I mean, she is a very well-connected lady.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.046
No, you said you'd help.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.548
I mentored her.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.634
And she misunderstood.

20:58.717 --> 21:02.095
Will you just pop round and let her know
she's got her wires crossed?

21:02.721 --> 21:04.598
You're much better at that kind of thing.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.183
Thank you.

21:07.976 --> 21:08.977
I can't.

21:10.771 --> 21:11.855
This means a lot to her.

21:12.856 --> 21:16.068
She's taking advantage
of your kindness, Mammy.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.489
She misunderstood.

21:48.809 --> 21:50.561
Your hair looks nice. Come in.

21:50.644 --> 21:54.106
Hot chocolates from Starlings with
a bit of chili in it, like you like it.

21:54.940 --> 21:55.941
You're an angel.

22:01.405 --> 22:02.656
We can't give you the money.

22:06.368 --> 22:07.369
What do you mean?

22:08.829 --> 22:10.080
JP, he--

22:10.163 --> 22:14.668
We can't fund the massage studio.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.961
The loan, we can't.

22:16.879 --> 22:18.839
I don't get it. Why? What happened?

22:18.922 --> 22:22.801
Well, JP says he never actually said
he'd help you financially.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.555
Excuse me?

22:26.638 --> 22:28.348
It was more of an advice session.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.270
Am I on drugs?

22:33.353 --> 22:36.398
You were there, Grace.
You know he was into it.

22:37.232 --> 22:40.819
I'm meeting the estate agent tomorrow
to pay for the second installment.

22:40.903 --> 22:43.572
I put the first half
on a bloody high-interest credit card.

22:43.655 --> 22:44.656
Becka, please.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.075
He has to help me.
You have to talk to him.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.327
Look, I don't know what's--

22:48.410 --> 22:50.245
We could help you out
in other ways with it.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.748
-We could come in--
-I'm broke! I signed a lease! I--

22:52.831 --> 22:55.667
I don't need him to rub down clients.
I need the money.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.753
I'm so sorry.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.797
Why would he make you tell me?

23:01.924 --> 23:04.760
I mean, that's demented.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.389
This is messed up, Grace.

23:09.473 --> 23:13.101
I mean, don't you think
that this is so off…

23:15.354 --> 23:17.064
I think it's just a misunderstanding.

23:38.669 --> 23:39.711
Fergal!

23:42.130 --> 23:43.131
Fergal Loftus.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.633
Who is this clown?

23:44.716 --> 23:47.135
Thomas Claffin.
We were due to meet earlier.

23:47.219 --> 23:50.264
I stood at Claire's Accessories
for 55 minutes waiting for you.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.265
You didn't come.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.433
Yeah.
I was called to a triple murder in Dalkey.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.894
Yeah, apologies for keeping you waiting.

23:56.562 --> 23:58.689
Apology accepted.
Now can we just get on with it?

23:58.772 --> 24:01.692
-Fergal is golfing, insurance man.
-I wasn't talking to you.

24:01.775 --> 24:04.069
If you want to speak to me,
you call my office, all right?

24:04.152 --> 24:06.613
People are staring.
You're clearly not dressed for golf.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.534
I told the receptionist
a pretty horrible lie

24:10.617 --> 24:11.952
to get in here to talk to you,

24:12.035 --> 24:14.830
so I'm not leaving
till I've said what I have to say.

24:16.707 --> 24:19.918
-Jesus Christ. Make it quick.
-Right.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.967
Fire in the cabin.
The car accident at the hotel.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.802
See, there's too many claims.
Too many coincidences.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.347
Well, I can do nothing
without actual evidence.

24:32.431 --> 24:33.891
And without proper procedure.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.309
I told you, the widow signed.

24:35.893 --> 24:37.728
She wants this to happen. Why don't you?

24:39.062 --> 24:41.690
Now, why would she put herself
through something like that?

24:42.733 --> 24:48.197
Having a body exhumed, picked apart,
is agony for a grieving family.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.199
Why did she sign?

24:50.282 --> 24:53.327
She obviously feels something is off.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.246
Something is off.

24:57.706 --> 25:01.293
And I'm presuming the local Gardaí found
nothing suspicious about this man's death.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.086
Not as such,
but they haven't the--

25:05.714 --> 25:06.715
No.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.133
I'm not going to exhume a body

25:08.217 --> 25:10.886
every time an insurance firm
doesn't want to pay out.

25:11.929 --> 25:14.973
Because as far as I can see,
you have got nothing.

25:16.517 --> 25:17.851
Can you believe this guy?

25:17.935 --> 25:20.270
He told the receptionist
his daughter's been kidnapped.

25:20.354 --> 25:22.523
He doesn't even
have golf shoes on.

25:28.237 --> 25:29.238
Tom.

25:31.532 --> 25:36.036
Tom, can we please go home now?
This is all getting a bit much.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.371
Fore!

25:40.165 --> 25:41.792
Did you even go to the pub?

25:41.875 --> 25:42.876
What pub?

25:42.960 --> 25:45.087
Jesus. The pub.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.464
To check if JP was actually there
the night he died.

25:47.548 --> 25:50.092
Oh, right. Yeah, I did.
I talked to the barmaid.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.302
JP ate all the free sandwiches,

25:52.386 --> 25:55.264
he kept to himself,
tried to get money off his bill.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.349
-That's it.
-So, nothing. Again!

25:57.432 --> 25:58.892
Jesus, I can't keep doing this.

25:58.976 --> 26:00.561
Well, we could just stop.

26:01.311 --> 26:04.523
You know,
and declare bankruptcy and start again.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.108
Stop? There is no stop, Matt.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.694
I haven't slept a full night in weeks.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.613
Can't hear anything
my wife says to me anymore.

26:11.697 --> 26:13.907
All I hear is,
"Don't blow your lives up, Thomas!

26:13.991 --> 26:16.743
-Don't blow it all up!"
-There's no need for this. It's mad.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.288
Look, Matt.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.372
What?

26:21.373 --> 26:23.166
Just, I can't do this on my own.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.256
H--

26:29.339 --> 26:30.924
-You're still talking to her?
-No.

26:31.008 --> 26:32.885
-Just stay out of it.
-We need information.

26:32.968 --> 26:36.013
I'm up against the wall, and you can help
knock it down for me, Matt.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.723
No. Please don't ask me, Tom. No.

26:37.806 --> 26:39.391
You know her five minutes.
I'm your brother.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.268
You're asking me to use Becka
to get to the sisters?

26:41.351 --> 26:43.228
No. Look at me.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.772
I am desperate here. I am desperate.

26:47.441 --> 26:48.442
Help me.

27:23.936 --> 27:25.354
Excuse me!

27:33.820 --> 27:34.988
Hiya, Blanaid!

27:37.199 --> 27:39.451
Blanaid, hiya!

27:41.828 --> 27:43.288
Yeah, well. I should…

27:54.299 --> 27:56.760
Wow. A little fist pump.

27:56.844 --> 28:00.889
-You happy? Good news?
-No. I was punching the air in grief.

28:00.973 --> 28:03.100
She's also sardonic. I love it.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.769
Excuse me.

28:05.853 --> 28:06.979
Yeah.

28:07.062 --> 28:08.063
Thank you.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.525
No. I just saved the company 50K
on the Henderson deal, so…

28:12.276 --> 28:13.485
Gerald just high-fived me.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.238
I mean, he missed,
and it was extremely awkward,

28:16.321 --> 28:20.284
but I've never seen him do that before.
So, basically, I'm a bad bitch, Gabriel.

28:20.367 --> 28:21.910
Yeah, you are. You're brilliant.

28:22.786 --> 28:24.872
-Let's go out for lunch.
-Yeah?

28:26.039 --> 28:27.207
Yeah. Yes.

28:27.291 --> 28:31.712
Because I saw you drinking
from the third-floor tap yesterday.

28:31.795 --> 28:34.464
And that shit's yellow, so, you know,
you clearly haven't got a clue.

28:34.548 --> 28:37.843
You need someone to show you the ropes.
And by ropes, I mean pubs.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.970
Okay. I won't argue with that.

28:40.554 --> 28:43.307
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'll come to your desk at 12:30.

28:44.016 --> 28:46.059
Okay, cool. Coo--

28:47.019 --> 28:48.270
Oh, my God.

28:54.193 --> 28:56.695
Becka. I asked him out.

28:58.322 --> 29:01.700
I just said it.
You know, like a woman in an ad.

29:01.783 --> 29:02.826
So, we're going out.

29:03.368 --> 29:04.912
He's distractingly good-looking.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.919
No. I screwed it up.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.338
Okay, okay. Hang on.

29:14.922 --> 29:16.006
No smiling.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.090
Okay.

29:30.854 --> 29:31.939
What?

29:32.022 --> 29:34.775
I can't believe
JP is married to your sister.

29:34.858 --> 29:38.111
-Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
-Yeah.

29:38.195 --> 29:41.448
I don't know if I could listen
to racist, misogynistic shit

29:41.532 --> 29:44.076
spewing out of his thin lips
on my days off.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.079
I'm so sorry, that just came out.
He's your family.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.872
Yeah, that man's not my family.

29:48.956 --> 29:52.376
You know they just made
the first-floor toilets gender-neutral?

29:52.459 --> 29:55.045
-Oh, yeah.
-Well, he stole a cubicle.

29:55.879 --> 29:56.880
He did what?

29:57.923 --> 29:58.799
What?

29:58.882 --> 30:01.301
He made a little sign
for one of the cubicles saying,

30:01.385 --> 30:03.720
-"Men only. JP Williams's cubicle."
-Oh, my God.

30:03.804 --> 30:04.888
"Do not enter."

30:04.972 --> 30:06.557
-Shut up!
-Yeah.

30:07.182 --> 30:10.394
Obviously, someone just took
the sign down, but what the hell?

30:10.477 --> 30:11.645
With his little sharpie.

30:12.604 --> 30:15.148
John Paul's toilet.

30:17.109 --> 30:18.110
Yeah.

30:18.193 --> 30:20.028
I don't know why I'm laughing, honestly.

30:20.946 --> 30:22.656
He asked every single man in the office

30:22.739 --> 30:24.783
to be his partner
for the table quiz tonight.

30:25.784 --> 30:28.120
I told him I'd prefer to partner with you.

30:30.372 --> 30:31.373
Yeah.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.125
Well, I'm partnering with my sister.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.626
Sorry, babe.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.420
It's just you and JP.

30:36.962 --> 30:39.006
Yeah. I would rather lick a bus.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.301
-Wow.
-Good, right?

30:42.384 --> 30:44.344
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

30:44.428 --> 30:46.555
I just heard a girl saying that
in a supermarket.

30:48.182 --> 30:49.600
That's so cute.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.479
You have the best laugh I've ever heard.

30:54.563 --> 30:56.356
-Stop.
-No.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.734
My sisters say I sound
like a van reversing.

30:59.318 --> 31:00.319
Like a what?

31:00.402 --> 31:01.403
Like a--

31:01.945 --> 31:05.199
Like a van. Like a van reversing.

31:19.421 --> 31:20.464
Love, why did you--

31:22.549 --> 31:23.550
What, Mom?

31:24.218 --> 31:27.054
Bla, you blanked me today in town.

31:27.137 --> 31:28.263
I didn't see you.

31:28.347 --> 31:29.431
-No?
-No.

31:31.475 --> 31:32.893
I did see you. I saw you.

31:34.561 --> 31:36.230
Well, I know you did. I saw you see me.

31:36.313 --> 31:39.399
Can you just stand up, Mom? Like, please.

31:39.483 --> 31:42.402
I'm cleaning the bathroom floor, Blanaid.
Someone has to.

31:42.486 --> 31:43.779
You never just stand up!

31:43.862 --> 31:46.573
-I am standing up.
-You never do anything!

31:46.657 --> 31:49.535
-Well, that's not strictly true, is it?
-Sadie's mom does pole dancing.

31:50.327 --> 31:52.204
She has unbelievable core strength.

31:52.913 --> 31:55.832
And Donncha's mom
is a human rights lawyer.

31:55.916 --> 31:58.460
Like, she saves lives with her brain.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.838
You're just here all the time.

32:02.422 --> 32:03.423
Ouch.

32:04.633 --> 32:08.053
-I'm not saying you're useless.
-Well, that's good then. That's lovely.

32:08.136 --> 32:10.514
Just, you were going to
maybe work for Auntie Beck.

32:11.348 --> 32:12.891
And now you just, what, give up?

32:14.810 --> 32:15.811
Sorry.

32:16.311 --> 32:17.896
-I didn't mean--
-No, it's fine.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.606
God, sorry! Okay?

32:28.073 --> 32:29.074
What?

32:36.999 --> 32:38.542
Ursula!

32:38.625 --> 32:39.626
Ursula!

32:40.210 --> 32:41.211
Jesus!

32:43.297 --> 32:44.882
Bring back my shoe, hon.

32:49.344 --> 32:51.763
-Hi.
-What are you doing? You don't run.

32:51.847 --> 32:54.558
Yeah. No. I don't.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.228
Demented way to spend your time.

32:59.855 --> 33:02.316
Are you drinking? It's only lunch time.

33:03.358 --> 33:04.735
My life is in tatters.

33:05.319 --> 33:06.528
What's happened?

33:08.947 --> 33:10.949
John Paul.

33:12.117 --> 33:13.327
He lied to me, Ursula.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.662
He's not gonna give me the money.

33:16.872 --> 33:18.957
Was he getting
some kind of perverse pleasure

33:19.041 --> 33:21.543
out of watching me do cartwheels
to impress him?

33:22.669 --> 33:23.795
Prick.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.051
Urs?

33:30.135 --> 33:31.386
What's up?

33:32.471 --> 33:33.847
I cheated on Donal.

33:35.015 --> 33:36.141
Oh, my God. When?

33:37.518 --> 33:38.685
Last night?

33:40.437 --> 33:42.397
No, not last night.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.482
When?

33:44.316 --> 33:45.901
Ursula. Donal is so sweet.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.611
That's not helpful.

33:47.694 --> 33:50.322
-Well, when did you do it?
-It's been going on a while.

33:51.448 --> 33:52.616
Quite a while.

33:54.201 --> 33:55.202
Shit.

33:57.371 --> 33:58.622
Hang on, who knows?

33:59.373 --> 34:00.374
Eva and Bibi.

34:01.208 --> 34:02.876
Everyone except me, basically.

34:02.960 --> 34:07.381
And Grace. I didn't want to tell anyone.
It's not really the point.

34:07.464 --> 34:11.009
So, everyone knows this huge thing,
and I'm on the outside again?

34:11.592 --> 34:13.344
No. I can't.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.806
Oh, my God. Don't be so selfish, Becka.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.353
Seriously? That's rich.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.904
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

34:32.989 --> 34:36.284
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm an asshole.

34:36.368 --> 34:37.369
I'm sorry.

34:40.455 --> 34:41.456
It's not so bad.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.293
Donal doesn't know. You could fix this.

34:46.253 --> 34:47.420
It's not just that.

34:49.047 --> 34:50.047
There's more.

34:53.552 --> 34:54.719
It's the prick.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.391
Okay, okay.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.311
The annual Fisher & Co. pub quiz
must now come

35:02.394 --> 35:04.813
to its inevitable, horrifying conclusion.

35:06.523 --> 35:10.485
Now, in the last round,
we had to say goodbye, au revoir, adieu

35:10.569 --> 35:13.197
to the stunning Gabriel.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.866
-Everybody say "aw."
-Au revoir.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.242
I love him so--

35:17.326 --> 35:18.744
And his basic partner, of course. What?

35:18.827 --> 35:25.542
But this next round
is the "name that song" round.

35:25.626 --> 35:27.419
Yes! I'm so good at this. I swear.

35:27.503 --> 35:28.921
-Focus, Grace.
-One of you…

35:29.004 --> 35:32.382
-…is going to hum the song. No lyrics!
-It's hot.

35:32.466 --> 35:35.177
And the other one is going to guess, okay?

35:36.553 --> 35:37.679
Definitely okay.

35:37.763 --> 35:39.139
Go, Gracie!

35:39.223 --> 35:40.557
-At this stage…
-You ready?

35:40.641 --> 35:43.101
-…we only have two teams remaining…
-I am. I'm focused, I promise.

35:43.185 --> 35:44.269
…in the competition.

35:44.353 --> 35:51.026
The beautiful Bibi and Eva
and, of course, JP and the amazing Grace.

35:52.486 --> 35:58.367
But to hold the winner's trophy aloft,
it all comes down to this final round.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.410
-Eva, are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.578
Here is a song.

36:01.662 --> 36:03.038
-Okay. Can I see--
-Here's a microphone.

36:03.872 --> 36:06.041
-Please hum that tune!
-All right.

36:06.124 --> 36:08.460
Can't hear you down the back!

36:08.544 --> 36:11.046
Literally just clearing my throat. Okay.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.423
-You ready?
-Yep.

36:15.551 --> 36:16.510
Frank Sinatra!

36:21.056 --> 36:22.140
"Dirty Old Town."

36:22.224 --> 36:23.600
Yes!

36:24.852 --> 36:27.938
-Gorgeous. Congratulations. Well done.
-Thank you.

36:28.021 --> 36:31.483
So, it's over to you, beautiful.
You ready?

36:31.567 --> 36:34.111
-Here we go. Right.
-Here's your song.

36:34.194 --> 36:37.155
Take that microphone. Hum that song!

36:37.239 --> 36:40.325
You know this one. It's gonna be so easy.
Yeah, here we go.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.664
Britney Spears!

36:45.747 --> 36:47.541
Oh, my God.

36:47.624 --> 36:48.625
Shut up.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.466
Do you know it?

37:02.514 --> 37:04.433
-Try the second verse.
-Think of our wedding.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.520
-Try a different verse, perhaps?
-Listen, listen.

37:10.355 --> 37:11.690
Come on, JP!

37:14.109 --> 37:16.361
Oh, come on, Grace!
Nobody's getting it! Come on.

37:16.445 --> 37:18.864
-Yeah, we are.
-Well, we all get it.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.413
Sing it, Grace.

37:27.456 --> 37:29.458
Sing it for Christ's sake! Just--

37:29.541 --> 37:31.793
Time is up.

37:31.877 --> 37:35.797
And the winners are
the beautiful Bibi and Eva!

37:41.553 --> 37:43.847
We haven't had this much fun
since last year's annual quiz.

37:43.931 --> 37:47.142
-What the bloody hell was that?
-I nearly sang the whole song, JP.

37:47.726 --> 37:49.102
It's pathetic.

37:50.270 --> 37:51.688
You embarrassed me.

38:05.911 --> 38:08.789
Want some more?
'Cause I know you love shitty…

38:08.872 --> 38:10.582
-of champagne…
-Yeah.

38:10.666 --> 38:12.209
…you tacky cunt.

38:12.292 --> 38:13.836
Loser spoils for the loser.

38:13.919 --> 38:15.754
Happy to let the girls win, Gerald.

38:17.214 --> 38:18.382
You all right?

38:18.465 --> 38:21.885
Yeah, just a little bit worried about Eva.
That's her seventh gin.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.596
Seventh? Jesus.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.475
I don't want to hassle her,

38:28.559 --> 38:31.144
but I'd like to get her in a cab
before she regrets anything.

38:34.064 --> 38:35.440
Here comes trouble.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.567
I need to talk to you.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.944
-Well, hello.
-We should get you a 7 Up.

38:39.027 --> 38:41.697
-I don't want a drink. I wanna talk.
-Excuse me?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.448
Or we could talk here if you want.

38:45.701 --> 38:47.452
Sister problems, Gerald. Sorry.

38:54.293 --> 38:57.337
This is my work.
We don't play with my work.

38:57.421 --> 38:59.006
Ever, Rebe-- Ev--

38:59.089 --> 39:00.465
You're sick.

39:01.425 --> 39:02.759
Lower your voice.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.011
I'm warning you.

39:04.094 --> 39:06.430
-Maggoty piece of shit!
-I'm warning you!

39:06.513 --> 39:08.348
Shut your mouth!

39:08.432 --> 39:10.934
Hey! What the fuck? Get off her!

39:11.018 --> 39:13.562
-You're a bastard! You're a bastard!
-Well, I just--

39:13.645 --> 39:15.355
-I tried to calm her down.
-That's enough.

39:15.439 --> 39:17.065
Becka, let's get you a drink.

39:17.149 --> 39:20.736
-She doesn't need to drink. She's a wreck.
-No, I'm not a wreck. I'm angry.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.364
And that doesn't make me mad,
or drunk, or hysterical.

39:24.448 --> 39:26.074
That just makes me angry!

39:26.158 --> 39:27.284
Okay, B.

39:27.367 --> 39:30.412
You don't know what he did.
Don't defend him, you hate him!

39:30.495 --> 39:33.707
I'm the one who always said he was okay,
but he is not okay.

39:33.790 --> 39:35.834
What he did to Urs is sick!

39:36.335 --> 39:38.587
Please just not here.

39:39.713 --> 39:41.632
-You can go.
-Thanks, cyclops.

39:47.763 --> 39:50.098
-What is going on?
-He's trying to ruin us.

39:50.182 --> 39:52.309
-We need to call the guards.
-What happened, Becka?

39:52.392 --> 39:54.186
Not that the guards
ever do anything about this.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.563
-But we can't just do nothing!
-Becka, what did he do?

39:56.647 --> 39:57.648
He…

40:00.067 --> 40:02.110
I think she should tell you herself.

40:08.534 --> 40:10.494
I took the picture for Ben.

40:13.038 --> 40:15.123
But I sent it to JP's phone.

40:15.207 --> 40:16.208
What?

40:17.918 --> 40:20.295
He made himself Ben in my phone.

40:21.713 --> 40:26.552
And I told him, "This pussy is yours."

40:26.635 --> 40:28.929
-Jesus!
-It's a quote from a book.

40:29.012 --> 40:30.722
It doesn't matter where-- Just--

40:30.806 --> 40:32.975
I know I shouldn't have been
messing around with Ben

40:33.058 --> 40:35.060
behind Donal's back. It was weak of me.

40:35.143 --> 40:36.812
Why are you saying that? It's not--

40:36.895 --> 40:39.064
Listen to me, Ursula Garvey.

40:39.147 --> 40:41.233
This is about that perverted prick.

40:41.316 --> 40:42.526
Okay? It's on him!

40:45.487 --> 40:47.698
It's not safe in general
to send pictures of your pussy.

40:48.782 --> 40:51.034
-Nothing's ever really encrypted.
-Don't shame her.

40:51.118 --> 40:53.745
That's your fecking vulva,
you can do what you want with it.

40:53.829 --> 40:54.830
She's right.

40:54.913 --> 40:56.248
She is. To be fair.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.294
I can't cope anymore.

41:01.128 --> 41:02.880
I just don't know what he's gonna do next.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.841
I can't even spend proper time
with the kids.

41:06.884 --> 41:08.051
So what-- So what are we gonna do?

41:08.927 --> 41:10.637
Are we just gonna allow this to happen?

41:10.721 --> 41:14.600
I mean, he's ruining people's lives!
He should be fucking underground!

41:14.683 --> 41:15.976
Well…

41:16.059 --> 41:17.769
-Bibi!
-No, I'm sorry.

41:18.604 --> 41:20.355
But he messed Ursula up.

41:20.439 --> 41:22.774
He promised me a loan
and then just binned me off.

41:22.858 --> 41:24.443
I mean, he screwed me.

41:24.526 --> 41:27.070
And Grace is so lost these days.

41:27.154 --> 41:29.865
I mean, she just lets him rewrite reality.

41:29.948 --> 41:34.536
And nods along like,
"Did he? Sorry, you misunderstood."

41:39.750 --> 41:40.751
Stay here.

41:44.755 --> 41:45.881
Well, where's she going?

41:52.429 --> 41:53.555
Come to the front door.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.854
Eva. What a nice surprise.

42:01.605 --> 42:02.981
-Hey!
-No!

42:04.650 --> 42:05.859
No.

42:10.155 --> 42:11.323
-Give me that!
-No!

42:11.406 --> 42:13.200
Give me that!

42:13.283 --> 42:14.243
You lunatic!

42:14.326 --> 42:17.412
Have you it saved somewhere else?
Have you the photo saved anywhere--

42:19.122 --> 42:20.123
Hey!

42:20.749 --> 42:22.709
-Hi.
-Auntie Eva.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.294
What's up? It's so late.

42:24.878 --> 42:28.257
Yeah, I thought I left my keys here so--

42:28.340 --> 42:31.343
Eejit. But I hadn't so,
I'm gonna head off.

42:31.426 --> 42:33.387
But I'll see you on Thursday, right?

42:33.470 --> 42:35.347
-For the cinema.
-Yeah. Okay.

42:35.430 --> 42:37.850
-Okay. Okay, dote. Bye.
-Bye.

42:37.933 --> 42:38.809
Bye.

43:04.001 --> 43:05.002
Fuck.

43:45.417 --> 43:48.462
I want in. I wanna help.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.341
No.

43:53.008 --> 43:55.928
-No way.
-You're pushing me out, Eva.

43:57.513 --> 44:00.474
You're not being my mom,
or my sister, or my friend.

44:00.557 --> 44:03.894
Fine if I'm not being any of those things,
but I'm not gonna stop protecting you…

44:03.977 --> 44:05.771
-You're not protecting me!
-…because that is my job!

44:05.854 --> 44:08.732
-You're isolating me.
-I don't even know why I'm having to--

44:10.692 --> 44:14.780
What we're doing, it's really, really bad.

44:14.863 --> 44:16.073
No, it's not.

44:17.783 --> 44:18.867
It's survival.

44:21.495 --> 44:23.664
Someone's not coming out
the other side of this.

44:24.831 --> 44:26.333
And it's not gonna be me.

44:28.001 --> 44:30.587
And it sure as shit is
not gonna be one of my sisters.

44:37.469 --> 44:38.804
Let me in, Eva.

44:49.398 --> 44:50.399
Okay.

45:30.689 --> 45:31.773
Come on.

45:31.857 --> 45:33.525
Theresa will eat me
if I don't bring food up.

45:33.609 --> 45:36.653
Yeah--
She's texting me again. Gimme a sec.

45:38.197 --> 45:39.531
I'll follow you up.

45:39.615 --> 45:41.074
Just do what you gotta do.

46:17.653 --> 46:19.363
-Sorry.
-Please.

46:20.155 --> 46:21.615
Thanks for letting me in.

46:22.199 --> 46:24.701
What? So, you're just--
You're stalking me now?

46:24.785 --> 46:26.286
I just wanted to clear this up.

46:28.288 --> 46:30.707
You think I'm some kind of vixen liar,
and I'm not.

46:30.791 --> 46:32.876
Well, what do you expect? You lied.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.879
Not lies. Just misunderstandings.

46:36.630 --> 46:39.675
-I didn't know you were a Claffin.
-I didn't know you were a Garvey.

46:40.843 --> 46:42.261
Information was withheld.

46:42.344 --> 46:45.389
I didn't say my last name, that's all.

46:46.390 --> 46:48.642
-You told me you were a bassist.
-I am--

46:48.725 --> 46:49.935
I am a bassist.

46:50.018 --> 46:53.021
-Insurance is your hobby or so is it?
-I just-- I can't handle lies.

46:53.105 --> 46:55.524
-I can't handle controlling men.
-I'm not controlling.

46:56.817 --> 46:58.277
I'm not trying to be.

47:01.738 --> 47:03.073
I don't wanna fight with you.

47:03.657 --> 47:04.658
No?

47:06.827 --> 47:08.328
Well, then why are you here?

47:15.294 --> 47:18.338
Why did you spray half a bottle of Joop
on yourself before you let me in?

47:18.422 --> 47:20.174
-It's not Joop.
-It 100% is Joop.

47:20.257 --> 47:21.466
Okay, it's Joop.

47:37.691 --> 47:38.817
You have to go, Becka.

47:43.822 --> 47:47.618
-I know you want this.
-I can't. I can't do this.

47:48.410 --> 47:49.453
I'm not gonna beg.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.841
Matt.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.428
I'm sorry. No. You have to go.
