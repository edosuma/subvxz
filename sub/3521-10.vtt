you'd be the chosen one

00:19.152 --> 00:21.654
she said

00:21.654 --> 00:24.657
you've got to burn

00:24.657 --> 00:26.659

born under a bad sign

00:26.659 --> 00:30.163

01:07.584 --> 01:09.702

01:28.104 --> 01:30.607

got yourself a gun

01:33.109 --> 01:35.111

01:43.269 --> 01:45.488

Talk it through the opening.

01:45.989 --> 01:48.491
Little left.
Little left on your end.

01:48.491 --> 01:50.493
All right!

01:53.997 --> 01:55.999
Open the door!
Any hinky shit,

01:56.499 --> 01:59.886
and you'll be refrying beans
with pablo escobar again.

02:03.640 --> 02:07.260
This is all a message
to your friends.
Stay away from port newark.

02:07.260 --> 02:11.397
Don't even drive
out to jersey.
Not even on sundays.

02:11.397 --> 02:15.768
I'll tell them.
They've been told.
Twice.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.770
Now i'll tell them.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.659
Here.

02:22.659 --> 02:26.162
Holy shit.
Ha, ha.
Bingo!

02:26.162 --> 02:28.164
We can't fit
all this shit
in the carton.

02:28.665 --> 02:31.167
Fuckin' crackheads
and their small bills.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.290
This is just a little token
of my appreciation....

02:37.290 --> 02:39.292
for recommending
dr. Melfi.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.795
She's a good shrink.
I'm not always
a model patient--

02:43.296 --> 02:46.799
what, what?
You didn't have to.
These are monte cristos.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.802
These are cuban.
Yeah, they're
the best, right?

02:49.802 --> 02:53.306
- They're illegal, aren't they?
- They're cigars.

02:53.806 --> 02:56.309
Oh, they're dreamy, ton'.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.311
You're a good
neighbor, bruce.

02:58.311 --> 03:02.315
Hey, look, i'm a doctor.
I make referrals all the time,
tony. You don't have to--

03:02.315 --> 03:05.818
- no biggie.
- I bet these motherfuckers
were hard to come by.

03:05.818 --> 03:08.321
Yeah, they fell off
a truck.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.324
Excuse me.

03:11.324 --> 03:14.460
- Hello?
- It's done.

03:14.711 --> 03:16.212
And it's the biggest
fucking refrigerator
you've ever seen.

03:16.212 --> 03:18.715
How about
the other thing?

03:18.715 --> 03:21.217
Juan valdez has been
separated from his donkey.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.840
You know, ton',
i've been meaning to say,

03:27.840 --> 03:29.342
i've been watching you
out back with your putter.

03:29.842 --> 03:34.597
You ever play at the club?
No, i play minnisink,
the public course.

03:34.597 --> 03:38.601
You know, you ought
to come to the club
and play sometime.

03:38.601 --> 03:41.104
Nah, you know, it's--
come on.

03:41.104 --> 03:43.606
It's a wicked back nine.
And besides,
some of the members,

03:43.606 --> 03:45.608
i think you'd like them
very much.

03:45.608 --> 03:48.111
Yeah, maybe, you know.

03:48.111 --> 03:50.113
We'll see.

03:50.496 --> 03:51.998
Here we go.

03:51.998 --> 03:55.501
Fresh champagne,
gentlemen.
Oh, that's beautiful.

03:55.501 --> 03:59.005
I love a mixed salad.
I can stare
at it for hours.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.507
A score like this happens
once in a lifetime.

04:01.507 --> 04:04.010
Gotta make this work for us
out in the open, legit.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.013
Find a nice i. P. O.
Keep it spinning.
Live off the juice.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.882
- I. P. -- who?
- Go on in.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.635
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I. P. O. -- initial
public offering.

04:13.136 --> 04:16.139
Stock. We gotta find
some insider market
trading shit.

04:16.139 --> 04:18.141
Understand?
Where's my baby?

04:18.141 --> 04:22.145
Paulie, baby,
get that big dick
in the jacuzzi now.

04:22.145 --> 04:25.148
Whoa- ho!
Whoo!

04:25.398 --> 04:27.784
Taking off.

04:28.284 --> 04:31.788
We're gonna celebrate,
just me and adriana.
Mother of mercy.

04:31.788 --> 04:34.791
Could this be
the end of rico?
Maybe.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.410
Just maybe.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.413
Have fun.
Say hello to the broad.
Say hello to your girl for me.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.916
Thank you so much
for taking me to the theater.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.553
Rent.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.555
Fuckin'
broadway musicals.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.557
I mean, we're all
supposed to get all
fuckin' weepy- eyed...

04:51.557 --> 04:54.060
'cause they turned off
the heat in some guy's loft?

04:54.060 --> 04:56.562
I'm hummin' the scenery,
chrissy.

04:56.562 --> 04:59.565
Fifth- row, center,
and dinner at la cirque?

04:59.565 --> 05:01.567
Yeow!

05:01.567 --> 05:03.569
I'm embarrassed
to be hungry again.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.571
Thank you.

05:05.571 --> 05:09.075
Let's just say,
after how many years
with tony soprano's crew,

05:09.075 --> 05:11.577
some shit has finally
worked out.

05:11.577 --> 05:15.081
Just when i was starting
to wonder if, you know--

05:16.582 --> 05:19.836
whose fuckin' welfare check
you gotta cash to get
a burger around here?

05:19.836 --> 05:21.838
Shut the fuck up!

05:21.838 --> 05:25.708
Wouldn't it be cool
to own a restaurant
like la cirque?

05:26.209 --> 05:28.711
Come on with the careers.

05:28.711 --> 05:33.216
- That black guy over there--
he look familiar?
- You have my money.

05:33.216 --> 05:36.219
Why don't you just
forget about workin'
and be with me?

05:36.219 --> 05:40.223
Oh, yeah. And be
one of those wives
like carmela soprano?

05:40.723 --> 05:43.226
Breast- feed a bunch of rugrats
and then spend the rest
of your life...

05:43.226 --> 05:45.728
at the gym, just you
and your stretch marks.

05:45.728 --> 05:47.730
You're right.

05:47.730 --> 05:50.733
Cousin's always had a brain,
but what does she use it for?

05:50.733 --> 05:53.736
A husband who can't
even tell you where
the money comes from.

05:54.237 --> 05:57.240
Yo, hair net central,
what am i back here,
mark fuhrman?

05:57.740 --> 05:59.992
You a dick!
- Would you chill?

05:59.992 --> 06:01.994
It's fuckin'
discrimination already.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.497
Hey.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.499
'Bout time.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.645 --> 06:21.647
Bold men make
bold statements.

06:21.647 --> 06:25.651
Why'd they send you over?
I'm lookin' for a burger,
not converted rice.

06:25.651 --> 06:29.272
- Your woman looks embarrassed. -

06:33.276 --> 06:37.280
come on, eh?
Give me a couple
of burger baskets.

06:39.782 --> 06:43.786
He's only bold
because he's semi- hooked up
with the tony soprano crew.

06:49.292 --> 06:51.294
What's with the attitude,
christopher?

06:51.294 --> 06:53.296
If it's not the blacks,
it's somebody else.

06:53.296 --> 06:56.299
Whoa!
Nice.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.684
Must belong to the homie
with the blue hat.

06:58.801 --> 07:01.804
Yo!
Donnie brasco!

07:01.804 --> 07:03.806
Yeah?

07:03.806 --> 07:07.310
My name is orange j.
I'm down with massive genius.

07:07.310 --> 07:10.313
That's who it was.
That gangsta rapper.

07:10.313 --> 07:12.315
I told you to shut up.

07:12.315 --> 07:14.317
We're having a party
at g's crib.

07:14.317 --> 07:17.320
Englewood cliffs.
You interested?

07:17.820 --> 07:20.323
And i get served
with black- eyed peas
tomorrow?

07:20.823 --> 07:24.327
I know what time it is.
Massive's heard of
the fuckin' crew you with.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.829
There's business
to be done.

08:05.001 --> 08:08.871
This is a beautiful,
beautiful home.

08:08.871 --> 08:12.375
Smaller than my hamptons crib,
but that's bigger than steven's.

08:12.508 --> 08:15.011
That's italian contractors,
obviously.

08:15.011 --> 08:18.014
Look at all these
gold records!

08:18.130 --> 08:21.767
Whoa!
What do we have here?

08:28.140 --> 08:29.642
You like that shit?

08:32.144 --> 08:34.145
A christmas present
to myself.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.150
Isn't that
a sight to behold?

08:40.152 --> 08:43.655
I do so love a good
firearm in my hand.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.801
You people are
all right.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.305
Godfather?
I seen that movie
200 times.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.808
Godfather iiwas
definitely the shit.

09:02.925 --> 09:05.928
The third one--
a lot of people
didn't like it,

09:05.928 --> 09:09.432
but i think it was
just misunderstood.

09:12.435 --> 09:14.937
So what kind of business
you want to discuss?

09:25.197 --> 09:27.199
Mr. Herman rabkin.
Hesh.

09:27.199 --> 09:30.202
I don't know him personally,
but i know his history.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.706
In the late'50s and'60s,
he owned f- note records.

09:33.706 --> 09:36.709
I don't know what
it was called, but, yeah,
hesh was in the music business.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.211
Little situation here.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.714
A distant- but- deceased
quasi- cousin
on my mother's side--

09:41.714 --> 09:43.716
little jimmy willis;
'50s legend--

09:43.716 --> 09:46.218
two seminal hit records
was his legacy--

09:46.218 --> 09:49.722
drug tragedy.
"Such a fool"--

09:49.972 --> 09:52.975
oh, i love that.
They play it all the time
on oldies radio.

09:53.476 --> 09:56.479
Old herman?
He's just another
in a long line...

09:56.479 --> 09:59.482
of white motherfuckers
stealing royalties
from the black man...

09:59.482 --> 10:01.484
that made them the money
in the first place.

10:01.484 --> 10:05.237
Jimmy's mother out
in san bernardino
who i call my aunt...

10:05.237 --> 10:08.124
is owed that money.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.626
Hesh is the world's
sweetest guy,

10:10.626 --> 10:13.629
but i've heard his opinions
on givin' back pieces
of israel.

10:13.629 --> 10:16.499
I can only imagine
what he's gonna say
about this shit.

10:16.499 --> 10:18.501
Feel free
to enjoy the food...

10:18.501 --> 10:21.003
and any other enjoyments.

10:24.507 --> 10:26.509
Champagne, sir, ma'am?

10:27.009 --> 10:29.845
Yeah.

10:32.848 --> 10:36.352
That guy's a gangster?
I'm a gangster.

10:36.352 --> 10:40.356
I'm an o. G. Original
gangster, not him,
fuckin' lawn jockey.

10:40.356 --> 10:43.359
And he's got the fly
hamptons house,

10:43.743 --> 10:46.746
alec baldwin comes over,
whitney houston--

10:46.746 --> 10:50.750
what do i got?
I sit in the fucking
pork store, for christ sake.

10:50.866 --> 10:54.370
But the moolies,
they got it goin' on,
and they're on tv.

10:54.620 --> 10:59.375
- They don't take no shit.
- Soprano crew, it's always
"secret this, omertathat."

10:59.375 --> 11:01.377
Fuckin' gets on my nerves.

11:01.377 --> 11:04.263
Junior, with his
moldy old sweaters,
and he's a fuckin' boss.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.767
And you were just feeling
so good about yourself.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.270
Our thing once ruled
the music business.
Did you know that?

11:11.270 --> 11:15.274
No.
We bankrolled acts.
Blacks, everybody.

11:15.274 --> 11:18.778
Paid the deejays or busted
heads to get em' played
on the air.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.280
There was some great
italian singers.
Fuckin' a.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.783
Frankie valli.
Dion. The rascals.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.785
That whole philly thing.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.788
My dad used to talk
about those guys.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.907
Now?
Fuckin' drum machines,
some ignorant poetry,

11:31.907 --> 11:35.411
and every fuckin'
fourth- grade dropout ditsoon
is chairman of the board.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.799
- Gangsters.
-

11:39.799 --> 11:43.803
talk aboutpaisanpride.
Go joey!
Shot to the heart

11:43.803 --> 11:46.806
and you're to blame
you give love

11:46.806 --> 11:50.059
a bad name
bad name

12:06.442 --> 12:08.444
oh, you're home.
Hey.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.580
Barb wagner called.
Remember her from
the fund- raiser?

12:11.580 --> 12:15.701
- The mayonaisses up the street?
- They invited us to a barbecue
over at their house.

12:19.088 --> 12:21.457
All right.
Didn't think so.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.463
Are you still
with the brochures?

12:27.963 --> 12:30.466
Can you believe how much
it costs for a college
education for four years?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.852
We got enough.

12:33.102 --> 12:35.604
I know we got enough,
but how much is enough?

12:35.604 --> 12:39.108
I mean, god forbid, what if
something should happen?

12:39.108 --> 12:41.110
You dig up my blue suit.
You call up old man coletti.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.112
You tell him not to put
too much makeup on my face.

12:43.112 --> 12:46.115
Don't joke around
about this, tony.

12:46.115 --> 12:49.618
You'll be taken care of.
You're always telling
me the same thing.

12:49.618 --> 12:51.620
I'll be taken care of.
By who?

12:51.620 --> 12:54.623
What is with the look?

12:54.623 --> 12:56.625
Did you just make a score?

12:56.625 --> 13:00.129
No. I wish.

13:00.129 --> 13:04.133
You know, tony,
it's a multiple- choice
thing with you.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.635
I can't tell
if you're old- fashioned,

13:06.635 --> 13:08.637
you're paranoid...

13:08.637 --> 13:10.639
or just
a fuckin' asshole.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.895
So what do i tell the wagners
about this barbecue?

13:16.395 --> 13:18.898
You want to go?
Sure.

13:18.898 --> 13:24.153
Cusamano asked me to play
a little golf with him
at his club.

13:24.153 --> 13:26.155
Sorry.
All right. Fine.

13:33.162 --> 13:37.166
Prick. The maitre d' is
really on the rag tonight.

13:38.167 --> 13:40.669
I'll talk to him.

13:40.669 --> 13:43.172
Remember richie santini?
Yeah, you used to fuck him.

13:43.172 --> 13:45.174
That really
sums it up.

13:45.174 --> 13:48.177
I knew him
since we were three.
He lived next door.

13:48.177 --> 13:51.180
Yeah, we had
our little phase.

13:51.180 --> 13:54.183
What about him?
You've heard his band.

13:54.183 --> 13:57.686
Defiler?
I'm not into that
headbangin' shit.

13:58.187 --> 14:00.189
You were talkin' about
the good old days.

14:00.189 --> 14:02.691
Italians running
the music business.

14:02.691 --> 14:05.194
And here's richie,
this musician who you know.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.696
They're not
a hair band anymore,
and they're really good.

14:07.696 --> 14:12.201
You said yourself
how much money
there was in this thing.

14:12.201 --> 14:15.704
You mean like, uh,
richie santini?

14:17.706 --> 14:20.209
You think massive genius
would be interested?

14:20.209 --> 14:23.212
It's a whole
different thing: Black.

14:23.712 --> 14:26.215
But he's got a company.
Massive g productions.

14:26.215 --> 14:29.218
Shit, they make
movies, even.

14:30.719 --> 14:33.222
Massive does owe me
a favor.

14:33.222 --> 14:36.225
I'm arranging a sit- down
for him with hesh.

14:36.225 --> 14:39.228
I was thinking about--
okay.

14:39.228 --> 14:41.230
I know this sounds
kind of funny.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.732
Music management.

14:43.732 --> 14:45.734
Huh.
And working here,

14:45.734 --> 14:47.736
i have met people,
important people.

14:47.736 --> 14:51.240
Learned people skills.
Had to deal with big egos.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.242
Solved problems.

14:53.242 --> 14:55.744
And with my love
of all kinds of music--

14:58.747 --> 15:01.250
maybe alec baldwin would
come to our house.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.625
You know who we are
you know what we do

15:09.625 --> 15:13.128
we're comin' to defile
defile you

15:13.128 --> 15:16.131
stay out of our way
and don't be so gay

15:16.632 --> 15:20.135
we're comin' to defile
defile you

15:23.138 --> 15:27.142
my- y- y lord

15:28.644 --> 15:32.398
- it's just an old demo.
- No. You know what?

15:33.399 --> 15:36.402
Fuck it.
Let's set you up.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.405
What?
I got money.

15:39.405 --> 15:43.409
You're right. With how much
you listen to the radio,
you'd be good.

15:43.409 --> 15:48.414
I can't believe it!
But i get to pick
what you wear.

15:48.414 --> 15:51.417
Dress you up.
I like that.

16:06.932 --> 16:09.435
This place has
the flava.
That gelding,

16:09.935 --> 16:11.937
name is sidney.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.940
So how come you never wrote
a song about him?

16:17.443 --> 16:20.446
When you and little jimmy
were writing partners
on all his hits,

16:20.946 --> 16:24.450
did you write the music
and him the lyrics,
or the other way around?

16:24.450 --> 16:27.453
We, uh, we had
our own process.

16:27.703 --> 16:31.707
So that "ooh, wacka- do,
wacka- dooley- do,
i'm so blue,"

16:31.707 --> 16:34.710
that spring from
your experience,
or the little brother's?

16:35.210 --> 16:37.713
One could write a song
about a horse.

16:37.713 --> 16:40.215
But in order for it to be
a hit with your target audience,

16:40.215 --> 16:44.219
he'd have to have a mounted
cop on him and ripped up the ass
with a mac ten, no?

16:45.721 --> 16:48.223
So you bought horses
with your royalties.

16:48.223 --> 16:50.726
And little jimmy's royalties,
whatever became of those?

16:50.726 --> 16:53.228
He bought horse.

16:53.228 --> 16:55.864
Music business back then,
we were breaking all the rules.

16:55.864 --> 16:57.866
Makin"em, breakin"em
as we went along.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.869
You mean rapin'
and pillagin'.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.621
Things haven't changed
much, huh?

17:03.122 --> 17:05.124
Were we hard- nosed?
Yeah.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.626
But we gave a lot
of kids their start.
A lot of negro youth.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.747
Took'em out of the ghetto,
kids with talent,
put'em on the stage.

17:11.747 --> 17:14.750
Herman, ordinarily,
i'd be more than happy...

17:14.750 --> 17:17.252
to stroll down
memory lane with you.

17:17.252 --> 17:20.138
But it's reparations
that i seek.

17:20.138 --> 17:22.141
Why don't we call this
what it is: A shakedown.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.144
Your own father
was a silent partner
in f- note records.

17:25.144 --> 17:29.148
Made sure that
the records got airplay,
isn't that right?

17:29.648 --> 17:32.651
Yeah, that money
built my house
on the jersey shore.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.653
What do you want to do,
hesh? I'm guided by you.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.156
- He's got to do the right
thing, that's what.
- Ohh!

17:37.656 --> 17:39.158
Hey. You're way
our of line, kid.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.660
Let's get some cold fucking
fizzy water on your head.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.918
Thank you, jen.
Let's get right
to the point, huh?

17:49.918 --> 17:52.037
What's in this for you?

17:52.037 --> 17:54.540
If you read
chuck d's book,

17:54.540 --> 17:57.042
you know he advises
that reparations be made...

17:57.042 --> 18:00.045
by the jewish studio moguls
in hollywood...

18:00.546 --> 18:03.048
on account of the way
black folks have been
portrayed in film.

18:03.048 --> 18:06.051
Now, that's only germane to
this argument inasmuch...

18:06.552 --> 18:10.055
as i feel that the grievances
in the music business
are far worse.

18:10.055 --> 18:13.058
You're talking to the wrong
white man, my friend.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.561
My people were the white man's
nigger when yours were still...

18:15.561 --> 18:17.563
painting their faces
and chasing zebras.

18:17.946 --> 18:22.317
And as far as louie b. Mayer
is concerned, what are you,
fucking nuts?

18:24.820 --> 18:26.955
My lawyers have done
a little research.

18:26.955 --> 18:29.708
I think that the final figure
is somewhere around...

18:30.209 --> 18:32.961
four hundred thousand dollars.

18:35.214 --> 18:39.218
Now, a cashier's check
made to mrs. Idella willis...

18:39.218 --> 18:41.220
will set
the record straight.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.839
Or what?

18:48.093 --> 18:50.095
What was it
that she called him?

18:50.596 --> 18:52.598
Oh, yeah.

18:52.598 --> 18:56.101
"That nice man,"
i think she said.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.614
So how's your neighbor,
the one with no neck?

19:08.864 --> 19:12.367
The sopranos? Well, there's
a new car in the driveway
every other week,

19:12.367 --> 19:14.369
but besides that--

19:14.369 --> 19:17.873
he gave me a gift
of some excellent
cuban cigars.

19:17.873 --> 19:20.125
- And you accepted them?
- Mmm- hmm.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.377
See? Eroding
the neighborhood values.

19:22.511 --> 19:24.513
He was thanking me
for referring him
to a physician,

19:24.513 --> 19:26.515
which he's very happy with.

19:26.515 --> 19:29.017
Really?

19:29.017 --> 19:31.637
What does that do
to property values,

19:31.637 --> 19:33.639
having a gangster
living next door?

19:34.139 --> 19:36.775
Are you kidding? Safest block
in the neighborhood.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.778
- And bein' a gangster--
what does that mean, anyway?
- Yeah, that's true.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.781
Some of the shit i see
in the boardroom, i don't know
if i'd make a distinction.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.901
Oh, will you please?
It's not the same thing.

19:45.901 --> 19:48.654
Bugging? Bribes?
I don't know.

19:48.654 --> 19:52.658
Sometimes i think the only
thing separating the american
business from the mobs...

19:52.658 --> 19:54.159
is fuckin' whackin'
somebody.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.163
Listen to you.
Whackin'.
What?

19:58.163 --> 20:00.666
He hangs around
with tony soprano
for 15 minutes...

20:00.666 --> 20:03.168
and it's "fuckin'" this
and "fuckin'" that.

20:04.803 --> 20:06.805
We were over there
for that fund- raiser.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.308
I didn't see
any guns anywhere.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.811
Oh, but that bar
with the goombah
murano glass?

20:15.564 --> 20:17.566
I like murano glass.

20:21.436 --> 20:23.939
Those monte cristos?

20:23.939 --> 20:26.441
What do you say?
After dinner?

20:29.945 --> 20:33.949
Just jaded
tired and bored

20:37.953 --> 20:41.707
right or wrong
i ain't strong

20:42.207 --> 20:46.712
like i used to be

20:46.712 --> 20:48.847
i want to

20:48.847 --> 20:53.352
erase myself

21:04.613 --> 21:06.615
i know it ain't
your type of music,
but--

21:07.115 --> 21:10.118
i like any kind of music
that turns shit green.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.623
Richie's been through
a lot. It's deep
in his writing.

21:14.623 --> 21:16.625
As a metal band,
they were fuckin' great.

21:16.625 --> 21:19.628
But this, as far
as i am concerned,
blows away matchbox 20.

21:19.628 --> 21:23.131
- What do they all themselves?
- Used to be defiler.

21:23.632 --> 21:26.635
Then some personnel changes--
bass and drums.

21:26.635 --> 21:29.137
But richie and vito are still
the core of the band.

21:29.638 --> 21:31.640
Now they're called
visiting day.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.142
Mom and dad

21:34.142 --> 21:39.147
had left me down

21:39.147 --> 21:41.149
and now i want to

21:41.149 --> 21:45.153
erase myself

21:45.520 --> 21:47.522
this is some loud shit.

21:47.522 --> 21:53.528
Oh, we are alone

21:53.528 --> 21:57.532
yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah

21:57.532 --> 21:59.534
whoo!

21:59.534 --> 22:05.290
- Take me away
- that's richie.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.295
And that's vito.
I don't want

22:10.295 --> 22:13.799
to stay

22:15.801 --> 22:19.554
- fuck you!
- Sit the fuck down,
you mullethead.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.813
This isn't the right place
for them.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.318
You suck!

22:33.318 --> 22:35.821
You know, without
the right help from you,

22:35.821 --> 22:38.457
visiting day could end up
in the miscellaneous
"v" section.

22:42.711 --> 22:46.832
Don't be sad
it's not bad

22:46.832 --> 22:51.837
- nobody cares
- you interested?

22:51.837 --> 22:57.342
I want to
erase myself
yes!

23:00.228 --> 23:03.231
That scene where pesci
sticks the guy's head
in a vise,

23:03.231 --> 23:06.735
and then he fuckin' pops
his eye out-- i mean,
i thought i was gonna die.

23:11.740 --> 23:13.742
I'll be right back,
okay?

23:15.243 --> 23:18.246
Excuse me.
It's this way, right?

23:18.246 --> 23:20.248
Yes.
Thank you.

24:00.288 --> 24:03.291
I don't know.
What?

24:03.291 --> 24:07.295
Richie. Guy's 30,
still lives with his parents.

24:07.295 --> 24:09.297
It's because of
the accident.

24:09.297 --> 24:12.300
Richie had third- degree
burns from trying
to grill that trout...

24:12.300 --> 24:14.803
with a downed
power line.

24:14.803 --> 24:18.807
At the same time,
being electrocuted
turned his life around.

24:20.308 --> 24:22.811
Well, you did some
ace fucking selling.

24:22.811 --> 24:24.813
You think?

24:24.813 --> 24:26.815
Yeah.
Thing is, though,

24:26.815 --> 24:30.819
music is not something
you can hold in your hands,
you know,

24:30.819 --> 24:34.823
like football betting cards
or coke.

24:35.824 --> 24:37.826
It's art.

24:37.826 --> 24:41.830
Berry gordy, whatever,
he had to see it
in the supremes.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.832
It's an instinct.

24:43.832 --> 24:45.834
I see it in richie.

24:45.834 --> 24:48.336
Yeah.
Probably is.

24:49.838 --> 24:51.840
I'm really fuckin'
doin' it!

24:51.840 --> 24:54.342
And it's all
thanks to you.

24:55.844 --> 24:58.346
I got to make a demo cd,
like massive advised,

24:58.346 --> 25:00.298
and then-- yeah!

25:00.398 --> 25:02.517
My wife thinks i need
to meet new people.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.387
So?
Come on. You're italian.
You understand.

25:05.637 --> 25:09.274
Guys like me, we're brought up
to think themeddigan
are fuckin' bores.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.777
The truth is,
the average white man
is no more boring...

25:12.777 --> 25:17.782
than the millionth conversation
over who should have won,
marciano or ali.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.285
So am i to understand that you
don't consider yourself white?

25:20.285 --> 25:22.287
I don't mean white,
like caucasian.

25:22.287 --> 25:26.791
I mean a white man,
like our friend, cusamano.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.294
Now, he's italian,
but he's ameddigan.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.796
He's what my old man woulda
called the wonder bread wop.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.299
Eats his sunday gravy
out of a jar.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.302
You seem to want
to branch out.

25:37.302 --> 25:40.672
What's stopping you?
The guys.

25:42.173 --> 25:45.810
What they'd think
if i started hanging out
with themeddigan.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.824
I was in your neighborhood
last night, at the cusamano's.

26:03.328 --> 26:06.331
- Oh, yeah?
- Dinner party.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.835
Shoulda stopped by.

26:10.835 --> 26:13.338
Live right next door.

26:20.462 --> 26:24.466
You didn't hear any
strange noises last night
in your neighborhood?

26:25.967 --> 26:27.969
Noises?

26:27.969 --> 26:30.472
Like someone
screaming in pain?

26:31.973 --> 26:34.476
Uh, no.

26:34.976 --> 26:37.479
Probably
a television set.

26:41.983 --> 26:44.986
You saw my house?
Mm- hmm.

26:54.996 --> 26:57.499
Oh!
This looks good.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.387
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
That sausage, huh,
where'd you get it?

27:02.387 --> 27:06.391
- Little place in garfield?
- Honey, where'd we get
the sausage?

27:06.391 --> 27:08.393
That little place
in garfield.
You know,

27:08.393 --> 27:10.395
the only thing better
than a little sausage
is a pair of tits.

27:10.895 --> 27:13.898
I don't know about that,
but it's a hell
of a piece of meat.

27:13.898 --> 27:16.901
Sausage is kind of
a phallic thing.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.903
Whereas tits--

27:22.273 --> 27:25.777
so, jack, you're
a stockbroker, right?
Mmm.

27:25.777 --> 27:28.279
Any changes
in the market comin'?

27:28.413 --> 27:31.032
They're always changing.
That's what keeps us
coming back.

27:33.535 --> 27:36.538
Oh, by the way, rand,
you hear from ross
on dexplex?

27:36.538 --> 27:39.541
No, not yet,
but the buyout is
definitely goin' down.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.793
Just give me a little
warning. I need
to call the islands.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.546
Dexplex?

27:49.934 --> 27:52.554
Oh, it's a little company.
It's going public, maybe.

27:52.554 --> 27:55.190
Hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, will ya?

27:55.190 --> 27:57.192
The sun is shining.
It's a beautiful day.

27:57.192 --> 27:59.694
Let's not talk business
for once, huh?

27:59.694 --> 28:02.197
American biotics.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.315
Barb, our stock guru.

28:04.315 --> 28:07.068
She thinks american biotics
may be a good investment.

28:07.068 --> 28:11.072
It's supposed to be close
to a side- effect- free
anti- impotence drug.

28:11.072 --> 28:14.075
You guys play
the stock market?
We don't just play.

28:15.076 --> 28:17.579
We win.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.972
Friends say i'm crazy

28:27.972 --> 28:30.975
she's gonna make me cry

28:30.975 --> 28:33.478
but none of them know
the way we

28:33.478 --> 28:36.481
steal a little kiss
and my, oh, my

28:36.981 --> 28:38.983
fools follow angels

28:38.983 --> 28:42.353
wanna believe she's mine
all mine alone

28:42.353 --> 28:45.857
why am i such a fool

28:58.620 --> 29:00.622
friends say i'm crazy

29:01.122 --> 29:04.125
she's gonna make me cry

29:04.125 --> 29:06.628
but none of them know
the way we

29:06.878 --> 29:10.265
steal a little kiss
and, oh, my

29:10.265 --> 29:12.267
fools follow angels

29:12.267 --> 29:15.270
wanna believe she's mine
all mine alone

29:15.637 --> 29:19.140
why am i such a fool

29:19.641 --> 29:23.144
erase myself

29:25.647 --> 29:29.150
are we alone

29:31.653 --> 29:33.655
yeah, yeah

29:33.655 --> 29:35.657
yeah, yeah

29:38.159 --> 29:44.415
take me away

29:47.302 --> 29:51.055
i don't want to stay

29:55.560 --> 29:57.061
there must be

29:57.562 --> 30:02.066
another way

30:15.079 --> 30:18.199
that's take 62.

30:18.449 --> 30:21.336
We oughta just bag it.

30:28.843 --> 30:30.845
Okay. We're baggin' it.

30:30.845 --> 30:33.848
We shoulda bagged this
two days ago when it was
fucking perfect.

30:33.848 --> 30:36.851
I wish i had
thought of that.

30:39.721 --> 30:42.724
It's good.
You know, not bad.

30:42.724 --> 30:44.726
I think it's as good
as we're gonna get
right now.

30:44.726 --> 30:47.729
Oh, it wasn't too bad.
It was kind of good.

30:47.729 --> 30:50.231
Hey.

30:50.231 --> 30:53.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you saying?
Is something wrong?

30:53.234 --> 30:55.236
No, i'm sure
we're all trying
our best here.

30:55.236 --> 30:57.739
I just think
we hit a brick wall.

30:57.739 --> 31:00.742
Maybe some rest.

31:00.742 --> 31:02.744
Hey, hey, fuck that!

31:02.744 --> 31:05.246
I paid for three days'
studio time already.

31:05.246 --> 31:08.750
It's only gonna cost me
more money to pack it up
and come in again, isn't it?

31:08.750 --> 31:12.503
I don't get it. We got through
the instrumental tracks
with no problem.

31:12.503 --> 31:15.006
Ah, i'm fuckin' beat.

31:15.390 --> 31:19.010
What do you say we finish
this shit? Three days now
we been slammin' our hams.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.263
Look,
kinkos gave me five days off.
It's not the end of the world.

31:22.263 --> 31:25.767
Kinko's?
Buddy, this is costing me
300 bucks an hour.

31:25.767 --> 31:27.769
Here. Try this.

31:30.772 --> 31:34.776
Dude, i don't do drugs
anymore, okay?

31:35.276 --> 31:37.779
Well, hats off.
But for all the dynamic
excitement in these songs,

31:38.279 --> 31:40.782
maybe we should get another
downed power line in here,
let you suck on it.

31:41.282 --> 31:43.167
- Christopher!
- What you just heard...

31:43.668 --> 31:45.169
was our balls- out,
most introspective song.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.673
- It's not supposed to rock.
-
it'll be our first single.

31:48.673 --> 31:51.793
No, dude, second.
"Sharon's chair" will be
the one that busts out.

31:52.293 --> 31:54.545
I like "melt."

31:54.545 --> 31:56.798
Come on. Go shoot the crank,
let's wrap this up, all right?

31:57.799 --> 32:00.802
- What?
- You heard me. Spike up.

32:00.802 --> 32:05.440
- No fucking way.
- Christopher,
i'm producing these sessions.

32:05.807 --> 32:08.309
Go take the fucking drugs.
I'm not fucking around
anymore.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.194
Look, the problem,
christopher,

32:10.695 --> 32:12.697
is that the bass
and the drum tracks...

32:12.697 --> 32:14.949
were miked wrong from
the fucking beginning.

32:14.949 --> 32:18.453
Whoa, hey, king of rock,
you're out of your depth.

32:18.453 --> 32:20.455
Look, let me tell you
something, dude.

32:20.455 --> 32:23.958
Thank you, but i've
recorded in denmark.

32:23.958 --> 32:26.961
Okay. You want to know
what the problem is?

32:26.961 --> 32:30.465
Where are
the fucking choruses?

32:30.965 --> 32:33.968
All your songs,
you got no choruses.

32:33.968 --> 32:35.970
Your choruses are basically
just another verse.

32:36.471 --> 32:38.589
I mean, what happened to
"she loves you," huh?

32:39.090 --> 32:41.843
- "She loves you"?
- Yeah, the song.
Started with the chorus.

32:41.843 --> 32:45.346
There is structure.
That's how you build
a song.

32:45.346 --> 32:47.348
The beatles,
the beatles,
the beatles.

32:47.348 --> 32:50.852
Look, that's been
40 fucking years now.
It makes me sick.

32:50.852 --> 32:53.738
- What is he, nuts?
- Fuck this, man.

32:53.738 --> 32:55.740
Where are you goin'?

32:55.740 --> 32:59.243
I'm goin' to a. A. ,
you fuckin' jerk- off.

32:59.243 --> 33:02.363
- Get back to work.
- Ooh, okay.

33:02.363 --> 33:06.617
- Huh? Huh? Come on.
- Ooh, big man, huh?

33:11.873 --> 33:13.875
Fuck!
You all right?

33:17.378 --> 33:20.381
What? What?
Get back in the booth!

33:23.267 --> 33:25.520
So we take it
from the top.

33:27.021 --> 33:29.023
We'll use a ukulele.

33:29.023 --> 33:31.642
I can't believe you.
Yeah, yeah.

33:31.642 --> 33:33.644
Five thousand shares.

33:33.644 --> 33:36.647
American biotics.

33:36.647 --> 33:39.150
Can you place
the order today?

33:40.651 --> 33:44.155
Okay, great.
I'll have the money
to you by tomorrow.

33:44.155 --> 33:47.158
Okay.
Thank you.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.294
Bye bye.

33:52.296 --> 33:56.300
- Are you spying on people now?
- I live here.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.669
Are you playing
wall street now.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.673
Women are better
savers than men,
and we are nurturers.

34:03.174 --> 34:06.177
What do you know
about the stock market?

34:06.177 --> 34:08.179
I keep
my ears open.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.681
Cnbc is a very
interesting channel.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.820
Listen, your father,
god bless him,
he does very well.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.322
But who knows,
you know?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.324
What if something
unforeseen should happen.

34:20.324 --> 34:23.327
What if he gets
hit by a truck.
I mean, then what?

34:23.828 --> 34:25.830
I got you kids
to think about.
I don't know, mom.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.833
Well, when you get
married, you will know.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.835
A woman's got to keep
her sense of individuality.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.837
This here is
a life lesson.

34:38.342 --> 34:41.344
Okay. Let's go to
georgette klinger's.

34:41.846 --> 34:46.350
Massage, facial,
joie de "beau- tay."
On me.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.469
Sure.

34:53.975 --> 34:56.610
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

34:56.610 --> 34:58.112
It's a lily.
Now, that's a shot.

34:58.613 --> 35:00.615
Ball runs like
a frightened fawn.

35:00.615 --> 35:03.618
W. C. Fields.
That thing's
still runnin'.

35:03.618 --> 35:05.620
I gotta tell ya,
this is a nice place.
Didn't i tell ya?

35:06.120 --> 35:08.122
We oughta see about
making you a member.

35:08.122 --> 35:10.625
Tony, you ever play
that place in orlando?

35:10.625 --> 35:12.627
No, i never get
down there.

35:12.627 --> 35:15.129
Well, disney world.

35:15.129 --> 35:19.133
You know, al's place.
Mount plymouth?

35:19.634 --> 35:22.637
- Al capone built it.
- No shit?

35:22.637 --> 35:25.139
Capone was a golf fanatic.
That's right.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.142
- So you guys watch a&e.
-

35:28.142 --> 35:30.895
tony, uh, let me
ask you a question.

35:30.895 --> 35:34.899
If i'm stepping
on any toes, tell me.
How real wasthe godfather?

35:39.520 --> 35:41.522
I mean,
in your opinion.

35:41.522 --> 35:44.525
What do you mean, real?
Authentic or not.

35:46.027 --> 35:49.530
I don't know.
How would i know?

35:50.531 --> 35:53.534
It was the'50s, right.
No, it was 1972.

35:53.534 --> 35:56.537
What he means is the story
took place in the'50s.

35:56.537 --> 35:59.674
I wanna know if you really
had to cut your finger
and take an oath.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.301
Like gridlock on times square
on this golf course today,
isn't it?

36:10.301 --> 36:14.305
This traffic in manhattan's
gotten worse since
"don't block the box."

36:14.305 --> 36:16.807
You got a lot of friends
in new york, tony?
Yeah.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.310
You ever go down
to little italy?

36:19.810 --> 36:23.314
- You know, san gennaro,
the feast, with the kids.
- Tell the truth.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.449
What's the first thing
you think of when you hear
"mulberry street"?

36:25.449 --> 36:27.451
Umberto's.

36:27.451 --> 36:29.704
Hey, did you ever see...

36:30.204 --> 36:32.206
that picture
of gallante dead...

36:32.206 --> 36:34.575
with a cigar hangin'
out of his mouth?

36:34.575 --> 36:37.211
- No.
- It's a fuckin'
beautiful hit, huh?

36:40.464 --> 36:42.466
Sorry, tony.

36:42.466 --> 36:45.336
You probably knew
the guy, huh?

36:45.336 --> 36:49.340
- How old you think i am?
- You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to,

36:49.340 --> 36:51.342
but i gotta know.

36:51.342 --> 36:54.345
Did you ever meet
john gotti?

36:58.849 --> 37:01.852
Yeah.
I knew john.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.739
Whoa! Fuck!

37:04.739 --> 37:06.741
What was he
really like?

37:11.862 --> 37:14.365
- Remember bungalow bar?
- The ice cream trucks?

37:14.365 --> 37:19.503
Like good humor,
except the trucks had
bungalow roofs on'em.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.006
Was gotti a silent partner
in all that thing?

37:22.373 --> 37:24.375
I don't know nothin'
about that.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.378
Just know that
when the company folded...

37:27.378 --> 37:30.631
and they were auctioning off
the last bungalow bar truck,

37:30.631 --> 37:34.135
the one with the peaked roofs--
you're right, cooze--

37:34.135 --> 37:36.387
cooze.

37:37.388 --> 37:40.391
Well, they're auctioning off
the last bungalow bar truck...

37:40.391 --> 37:42.893
and i wanted it
as a souvenir.

37:43.894 --> 37:46.147
Gotti outbid me.

37:49.650 --> 37:51.652
Gave me a ride home.

37:55.156 --> 37:57.658
You know,
he rang that bell...

37:57.658 --> 38:00.161
the whole way home?

38:10.554 --> 38:14.558
Oh! They're wavin'
at us.

38:20.431 --> 38:22.183
Meow
meow

38:27.822 --> 38:30.324
meow
meow

38:30.324 --> 38:33.327
i love this part.
Now i've lost

38:33.327 --> 38:37.448
my inner child

38:39.083 --> 38:41.085
i should hope
yeah, this is good.

38:41.085 --> 38:45.456
He ain't been defiled

38:47.091 --> 38:49.343
i am just

38:49.844 --> 38:54.098
that's some good guitar.
Listen to that shit.
A tortured soul

38:54.098 --> 38:56.100
they got it goin' on.
Makin' money

38:56.600 --> 39:01.972
yeah.
Is an empty hole

39:09.113 --> 39:10.114
meow

39:10.114 --> 39:12.116
meow

39:12.616 --> 39:14.618
meow

39:14.618 --> 39:17.121
meow

39:29.250 --> 39:31.252
so?

39:31.385 --> 39:33.888
I think it's, uh,
not good.

39:34.889 --> 39:37.258
Want to be a little
more specific?

39:37.258 --> 39:39.260
There's good and there's
not good. This is not good.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.762
Okay, maybe it's not your era.
No offense.

39:42.263 --> 39:44.765
Music is music.
Talent is talent.

39:44.765 --> 39:47.768
I don't care who you are.
And i've seen them all.

39:47.768 --> 39:51.906
I saw heavy metal invented
by hendrix at the cafe wha.
Kid just came out of the army.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.525
I said to him,
"kid, i don't know
what you call it--

39:54.525 --> 39:57.027
talent, charisma, magic--
but you've got it."

39:57.027 --> 40:00.281
These kids, they don't.
Sorry.

40:00.281 --> 40:02.783
You're just pissed
that i went against you
at the sit- down.

40:02.917 --> 40:05.920
Get the fuck out of here
and stop wasting my time.

40:06.036 --> 40:09.039
This vito is a great
fucking guitar player, hesh.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.542
Fine. Great.
He's a great guitar player.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.545
However, there's one constant
in the music business--
a hit is a hit.

40:14.545 --> 40:17.548
- And this, my friend,
is not a hit.
- Why?

40:17.548 --> 40:21.936
Christ. For reasons we couldn't
comprehend or codify,
you pathetic schlepper.

40:21.936 --> 40:26.440
Fuckin' massive is a genius,
so what the fuck was he
talkin' about?

40:26.440 --> 40:28.442
I remember when i was a kid,
there was this guy
in my neighborhood.

40:28.943 --> 40:30.444
We used to call him
jimmy smash.

40:30.945 --> 40:33.948
He wasn't retarded,

40:33.948 --> 40:35.449
but we thought he was because
he had one of these, uh,

40:36.951 --> 40:39.453
whatchamacallits.

40:39.453 --> 40:41.956
Hey, how the fuck
are ya?

40:41.956 --> 40:44.325
What do you call that?
Cleft palate.

40:44.325 --> 40:46.710
Yeah.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.713
Well, we was kids, right?

40:49.713 --> 40:52.716
So what the hell
do we know?

40:53.217 --> 40:56.720
Every time he opened
his mouth, we'd piss
ourselves laughin'.

40:56.837 --> 40:59.340
But jimmy didn't mind,
because he got to hang
out with us.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.726
Popular crew.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.728
Although we only called him
when we were bored.

41:04.845 --> 41:07.348
Called him, said,
"hey, jimmy.

41:07.848 --> 41:09.350
Sing'mack the knife'."

41:09.850 --> 41:11.852
And because he wanted
to hang out with us,
he'd belt it right out.

41:14.355 --> 41:17.241
We'd fuckin' roll
on the floor laughing.

41:20.244 --> 41:23.247
And then, you know,
when the laughs got old,

41:23.247 --> 41:25.249
we stopped callin' him.

41:27.251 --> 41:31.755
Wasn't till years later that
i found out the poor prick
was goin' home every night...

41:31.755 --> 41:34.508
and cryin' himself
to sleep.

41:39.630 --> 41:42.132
When i found out,
you know, i--

41:42.132 --> 41:44.134
i felt bad.

41:47.137 --> 41:49.139
But i never really
understood...

41:49.139 --> 41:50.641
what he felt.

41:51.141 --> 41:53.143
To be used, you know,

41:53.143 --> 41:56.647
for somebody else's amusement
like a fuckin' dancin' bear...

41:57.648 --> 42:00.651
till i played golf
with those guys.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.906
Well, you thought
cusamano was your friend.

42:07.408 --> 42:09.410
You live, you learn.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.550
Do you mind if i
ask you a question?

42:18.802 --> 42:22.172
Whatever happened
to jimmy?
Jimmy smash?

42:22.172 --> 42:25.175
He's doin' 20
for robbery.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.678
Wasn't too hard for the cops
to figure out who it was.

42:27.678 --> 42:29.680
He goes up to the bank teller
with a mask, he goes,

42:29.680 --> 42:31.682
"give me your money."

42:41.242 --> 42:43.744
Some fucker's
on the phone for you.

42:48.749 --> 42:52.253
Good morning, herman.
I'm listening.
Good.

42:52.253 --> 42:55.256
I wouldn't want you to miss
anything i have to say.
I've been thinking about it.

42:55.756 --> 42:59.627
- Go on.
- You'll have to find another
schmuck to have a moment with.

42:59.627 --> 43:01.128
You do know
what this means, herman.

43:01.128 --> 43:04.131
Stupid enough to say it
over the phone, let's hear it.

43:04.632 --> 43:06.634
I don't threaten, herman.
I act.

43:06.634 --> 43:09.887
Genius,
you're getting yourself in
way over your head here.

43:09.887 --> 43:12.389
Why don't you think about
backin' up a little bit?

43:12.389 --> 43:14.775
You know,
let sleepin' dogs lie.

43:14.775 --> 43:16.277
Hey, soprano.

43:16.777 --> 43:19.530
Let me share with you
what i suspect about
this gangsta rap shit.

43:19.530 --> 43:22.533
I think you probably got
a degree in sociology
from the city college.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.903
I grew up in the projects.
Delta 13.

43:25.903 --> 43:28.906
Killed a man.

43:28.906 --> 43:30.908
Later on,
i got a degree.

43:30.908 --> 43:34.411
But urban planning.
You were close.

43:34.411 --> 43:36.914
Now, when it comes to
which is mightier,

43:37.414 --> 43:39.917
the pen or the
motherfucking sword,

43:39.917 --> 43:41.919
i let the situation
dictate.

43:41.919 --> 43:45.422
- Don't press it.
- I'm gonna do my part...

43:45.923 --> 43:47.925
to keep mr. Rabkin's
people working.

43:47.925 --> 43:52.563
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Expect to hear from
goldstein, baum and woronov.

43:52.563 --> 43:55.432
They'll be representing
miss willis in the lawsuit.

43:55.432 --> 43:59.687
- You gonna sue?
- With what i pay in retainers,
fuck, yeah.

43:59.687 --> 44:02.189
I hear that.
Yeah, well.

44:02.439 --> 44:03.941
Listen, be advised...

44:04.441 --> 44:06.443
that on your artist
scratch's last single,

44:06.443 --> 44:08.445
you sampled
a backing vocal...

44:08.946 --> 44:11.949
from the chablis'
1968 song,"riff with it,"

44:11.949 --> 44:15.452
for which f- note records
controls the master
recording rights.

44:15.452 --> 44:17.955
No shit?
Yeah, shit.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.591
I would of course
have to counter sue.

44:20.591 --> 44:23.093
I'll see you in court.

44:24.094 --> 44:26.597
Fuckin' legal fees.

44:27.598 --> 44:29.216
What kind of moolies
are these?

44:29.717 --> 44:31.719
They call themselves
gangsters.

44:31.719 --> 44:34.104
It's a new fuckin' day.

44:34.104 --> 44:36.607
Fuckin' depressing.

44:36.974 --> 44:39.476
Okay. Now this
is a donatella versace.

44:39.977 --> 44:43.480
- Nice.
- You like it better
than the alaia?

44:49.370 --> 44:52.990
- Keep'em both.
- Christopher, $2, 400!

44:54.491 --> 44:58.495
- I don't think
you really like it.
- I like it. I like it.

45:06.003 --> 45:09.506
Huh?
Mtv awards?

45:14.011 --> 45:18.148
- What?
- Nothing.

45:18.148 --> 45:20.651
I thought we put
that fight behind us.

45:21.151 --> 45:23.153
You want me to take
all this back, i will.
No problem.

45:23.654 --> 45:26.156
No. Fuck, i want you
to have it.

45:42.172 --> 45:45.175
You know how i use
the technique of
positive visualization?

45:45.175 --> 45:47.177
I know you talk about it.

45:47.177 --> 45:49.179
You're fairly negative
a lot of the time.

45:49.179 --> 45:51.932
Well, i think you should
mentally prepare...

45:52.433 --> 45:55.936
for the fuckin' possibility
that visiting day sucks.

45:58.939 --> 46:01.942
- What?
- I think the only reason you've
gotten this far with massive...

46:01.942 --> 46:04.695
is he wants to be
in your pants.

46:06.196 --> 46:08.699
Boy, oh, boy.

46:08.699 --> 46:10.701
I let some experts
listen to the demo.

46:11.201 --> 46:12.703
They shit all over it.
I'm sorry.

46:13.203 --> 46:15.205
Experts?
Who, hesh?

46:15.205 --> 46:18.208
That old fucking
synagogue cantor?
Silvio.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.210
He owned rock clubs
in asbury.

46:20.210 --> 46:23.213
You heard what squid said.
He's a professional engineer.

46:23.213 --> 46:25.215
What about my opinion?

46:25.215 --> 46:27.718
That it's good,
that it's special?

46:34.224 --> 46:38.846
His eyes are on your ass,
adriana, 98% of the time.
You know that.

46:40.347 --> 46:42.349
This is just a way
for you to keep me down.

46:42.349 --> 46:45.352
- Aw, that ain't fair.
- I don't want these clothes.

46:51.358 --> 46:54.862
What's wrong with it, huh?
What's wrong
with visiting day?

46:54.862 --> 46:58.365
I don't know,
but it's a problem
that you don't know.

46:58.365 --> 47:00.367
Richie, he'll sing
anything.

47:00.367 --> 47:03.370
You just don't want to believe
that i could have a relationship
with a man...

47:03.370 --> 47:06.373
like massive that wasn't
based on fucking.

47:06.373 --> 47:08.375
That was based
on intelligence,

47:08.375 --> 47:10.377
respect, talent.

47:10.377 --> 47:12.379
I'll shut up.

47:16.383 --> 47:18.886
You sayin'
i don't have talent?

47:22.389 --> 47:24.892
I've branched out,
made new friends,
new horizons,

47:24.892 --> 47:26.894
and you can't stand that.

47:29.396 --> 47:31.398
Yeah.

47:31.398 --> 47:33.400
Go silent. That's you.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.903
Either screaming your head off
or fucking dead.

47:37.905 --> 47:40.407
I don't think i can
stay here anymore.

47:47.548 --> 47:50.551
I love you.
That is such a lie.

47:58.926 --> 48:01.061
Hey, carmela!

48:01.061 --> 48:03.564
In here.

48:09.069 --> 48:11.071
I need a finger.

48:12.573 --> 48:15.075
What's in the box?
Sand.

48:15.075 --> 48:18.579
I'm fuckin' with
cusamano.
Tony--

48:18.579 --> 48:20.080
beautiful.

48:20.581 --> 48:22.583
You look kinda cute
when you're bein'
a bad boy.

48:22.583 --> 48:24.585
You're awfully chipper
today.

48:25.085 --> 48:26.587
So what are you
gonna do with the box?

48:26.587 --> 48:31.091
Give it to him. Tell him to--
"hold on to it for awhile."

48:31.091 --> 48:34.094
Oh, tony!
That is so evil!

48:34.094 --> 48:36.096
Yeah, i know.
That's why it's
so much fun.

48:37.097 --> 48:39.099
Oh, good.

48:57.734 --> 49:00.237
Cooze. Cooze.

49:00.737 --> 49:02.739

49:14.251 --> 49:15.752

Cusamano.

49:16.253 --> 49:19.756
Yeah, it's got that
other connotation that--
no, not anymore.

49:19.756 --> 49:22.259
Listen, pal,
i need a little solid.

49:22.259 --> 49:25.262
I need you to hang on
to this for a while for me.

49:26.763 --> 49:28.765
Hang onto it a little while.
I'll come get it when i need it.

49:28.765 --> 49:33.770
How long?
A month, you know.
Maybe more, maybe less.

49:33.770 --> 49:36.273
Okay?
Thanks.
Yeah, sure.

49:37.774 --> 49:41.278
Oh, the club. I meant
to ask you about the club.
What's going on?

49:41.278 --> 49:43.780
Oh, the club.

49:44.281 --> 49:45.782
I'm sorry, ton'.

49:46.283 --> 49:48.285
Membership's closed.

49:48.785 --> 49:51.288
Closed?
Yeah.

49:51.288 --> 49:54.291
No new members
until old members die.

49:54.791 --> 49:56.793
Nobody's dyin'?

49:57.294 --> 49:59.296

49:59.296 --> 50:01.798
No biggie, cooze.
Thanks.
You sure?

50:01.798 --> 50:04.301
I mean, because--
naw.

50:04.301 --> 50:06.803
I'll live.

50:43.974 --> 50:47.978
And all temptations
i resist

50:47.978 --> 50:50.981
and nothing can compare
to this

50:51.231 --> 50:55.736
oh, nobody loves me

50:55.736 --> 50:59.239
nobody loves me but you

50:59.489 --> 51:02.492

Heroin?

51:27.134 --> 51:29.136
Shit, jean,

51:29.136 --> 51:31.138
A weapon?
I don't know.

51:32.639 --> 51:35.142
Could be anything.

51:35.142 --> 51:37.144
Uh, uh!
