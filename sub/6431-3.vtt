00:00.280 --> 00:02.081
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:03.109 --> 00:05.444
So...our own Warehouse
Doctor, huh?

00:05.511 --> 00:07.379
You like her.
Ask the woman out.

00:07.447 --> 00:10.782
Do you wanna come with me
for a little walk?

00:10.850 --> 00:12.093
I'd like that.

00:12.161 --> 00:14.011
- Who was Hugo Miller?
- A brilliant man.

00:14.079 --> 00:15.705
He's...Retired.

00:15.772 --> 00:18.465
Artie, half of his brain
is burnt out.

00:18.533 --> 00:20.397
Time to set things right.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.601
- Thank you, Agent Nielsen.
- I'm so glad you're back.

00:24.669 --> 00:26.470
Hello there.

00:26.538 --> 00:27.573
Sally Stukowski, FBI.

00:29.415 --> 00:31.949
You've done well.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.087 --> 00:41.924
Another one?
What is this?

00:41.991 --> 00:43.891
She's in P.E.A.
Down two minutes.

00:43.959 --> 00:46.328
BP's 90 over 50.
Pulse ox has dropped to 82.

00:46.396 --> 00:48.565
- Amp of EPI.
- Page Hillard upstairs.

00:53.376 --> 00:55.187
Damn it!
Just like the others.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.492
- She's in V-fib.
- Charge the paddle to 50.

01:00.062 --> 01:01.697
Okay, and...
Clear.

01:05.101 --> 01:07.170
What the hell?

01:09.873 --> 01:11.173
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.074
It's why I called the CDC.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.775
You did the right thing
to call us.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.242
I'm gonna bring in
a consultant.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.010
I think he'll be very helpful,
I'm sure.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.611
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:20.846 --> 01:22.113
Artie, where are you going

01:22.181 --> 01:23.448
in the middle of the night?

01:23.515 --> 01:25.149
Ah...Ha ha.

01:25.216 --> 01:26.984
Nowhere. No place.
Why?

01:27.051 --> 01:28.417
Is that the coat
I got you?

01:28.485 --> 01:31.453
This coat?
Uh...So what? Yeah.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.988
- Is that a clean shirt?
- Uh...No, it's not.

01:34.055 --> 01:36.157
Um...
Did you trim your eyebrows?

01:36.224 --> 01:37.525
Hmm? No.

01:37.592 --> 01:38.792
What's that smell?

01:40.195 --> 01:42.096
What? I don't...
Smell anything.

01:42.164 --> 01:43.832
Exactly.
You primped.

01:45.334 --> 01:47.135
You're going to see
Dr. Vanessa!

01:47.203 --> 01:49.304
Who's...Dr. Vanessa?

01:49.372 --> 01:50.638
- No one.
- Oh, wow.

01:50.706 --> 01:53.174
I have never had a lie
hurt before.

01:53.242 --> 01:57.011
She's the Warehouse
Physician.

01:57.079 --> 01:58.912
And...Artie's...

01:58.980 --> 02:00.880
Girly girlfriend.

02:00.948 --> 02:03.249
Uh, yeah.
<i>Dr.</i> Calder feels

02:03.316 --> 02:05.817
that there is an artifact

02:05.885 --> 02:07.952
that may be causing trouble

02:08.020 --> 02:09.219
in a hos...

02:09.287 --> 02:10.920
...pital in Utah.

02:10.989 --> 02:14.190
And she has asked me,
a colleague, to consult,

02:14.258 --> 02:16.158
and that is it!

02:16.226 --> 02:19.262
And now,
if you will excuse me!

02:19.329 --> 02:21.531
Did I not leave
enough food in your bowl?

02:21.598 --> 02:24.367
- I'm coming with you.
- Why? No. Why?

02:24.435 --> 02:25.668
A hospital, Artie?
There will be blood.

02:25.736 --> 02:26.903
When you faint,

02:26.971 --> 02:29.339
someone's gonna have to
break your fall.

02:29.407 --> 02:30.841
Ohh...
Fine. Fine.

02:30.908 --> 02:32.976
All right.

02:33.044 --> 02:35.779
- Are you wearing spanx?
- Stop looking at me.

02:43.421 --> 02:45.022
What are you do--just--

02:45.089 --> 02:46.523
oh! Hi.

02:46.590 --> 02:47.790
We came as quickly
as we could.

02:47.858 --> 02:49.458
Yeah. That's record time.

02:49.526 --> 02:52.227
Oh, blue scrubs.
They quite...become you.

02:52.295 --> 02:55.363
I mean, it brings out
the blue in your eyes and--

02:55.431 --> 02:57.265
- Oh, thank you.
- Cough, cough,

02:57.333 --> 02:59.134
said the uncomfortable
young person.

02:59.202 --> 03:02.705
So...Uh, what brings us
to the great Salt Lake...

03:02.772 --> 03:04.640
Oh, a series of very
unusual deaths.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.342
They called us, so called you--
I'm sorry.

03:06.410 --> 03:08.578
They know about the Warehouse?

03:08.645 --> 03:11.146
No, no, Vanessa was also
on staff at the CDC.

03:11.214 --> 03:12.481
- Sorry.
- Oh, oh, I get it.

03:12.549 --> 03:14.183
So the CDC is your Bruce Wayne
daytime face,

03:14.250 --> 03:16.184
but you spend your dark knights
with the Warehouse.

03:16.252 --> 03:17.752
- I gotcha.
- She takes great pride

03:17.820 --> 03:20.488
in making references neither of
us will ever understand, so...

03:20.556 --> 03:23.824
Riddle me this, Batgirl.

03:27.595 --> 03:30.196
- Is that a heart?
- It was.

03:30.264 --> 03:32.265
I don't get it.
She smoked five packs a day?

03:32.333 --> 03:35.368
Why is it all...
cracked and dry?

03:35.435 --> 03:37.903
I sent a tissue sample
to my lab.

03:37.971 --> 03:39.839
One of the technicians

03:39.907 --> 03:42.342
who spends his weekends
as an amateur botanist

03:42.410 --> 03:44.444
made a really strange
discovery.

03:44.512 --> 03:46.913
The heart muscle
has actually metamorphosed

03:46.981 --> 03:49.148
into diatomaceous earth.

03:49.216 --> 03:50.550
What?

03:50.617 --> 03:52.585
Uh, kidneys, spleen,
lungs...

03:52.652 --> 03:55.221
All this woman's organs
have turned to clay.

03:55.289 --> 03:58.491
Clay?
And...you say there are others?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.168
We may be facing
an artifact outbreak.

04:22.447 --> 04:25.726
- Aah!
- Aah!

- Artie's bedroom!
- Ho ho ho ho!

04:50.241 --> 04:52.175
Why are we in Artie's
bedroom naked?

04:52.243 --> 04:53.577
I don't know.

04:53.645 --> 04:55.312
Why were you
in bed with me?

04:55.380 --> 04:58.215
I was not in bed with you!
You were in bed with me!

04:58.283 --> 05:00.150
Naked!
You're naked too.

05:01.286 --> 05:02.653
And why are you blonde?

05:02.721 --> 05:04.321
I'm not blond!
Oh, my God!

05:04.389 --> 05:06.757
Oh, my God, I'm blond!
What did you do?

05:06.825 --> 05:08.692
No! Hey, don't blame me!
I mean, I'm good,

05:08.760 --> 05:10.861
but I've never changed
a woman's hair color.

05:10.929 --> 05:12.496
Pete, we--we--we did not...

05:12.564 --> 05:14.531
We did not do it, did we?

05:14.599 --> 05:16.500
I don't remember.

05:16.568 --> 05:18.970
- Did we get drunk?
- No! No.

05:19.038 --> 05:21.005
No. I-I know hangovers,

05:21.073 --> 05:22.674
and I do not feel hung over.

05:22.742 --> 05:25.744
There...must be
some simple explanation

05:25.812 --> 05:28.414
why you and I would be
in bed.

05:28.482 --> 05:31.384
Together.

05:31.452 --> 05:32.352
Naked.

05:37.625 --> 05:39.793
With Artie's toothbrush.

05:41.896 --> 05:43.297
All the victims
are female?

05:43.364 --> 05:46.266
So far, yeah.
I-I ordered a DNA analysis,

05:46.334 --> 05:47.634
but that's gonna take
a few days.

05:47.702 --> 05:49.035
Days we don't have.

05:49.103 --> 05:52.672
But what we do have is...

05:52.740 --> 05:55.541
Or, is that her original
DNA sequencer?

05:55.609 --> 05:56.876
- Yeah, it is.
- Whose?

05:56.944 --> 05:58.878
Well, Watson and Crick,
they won a Nobel Prize

05:58.946 --> 06:01.315
for their proposal of the double
helix nature of DNA.

06:01.383 --> 06:05.687
But all of their work was based
entirely on the research of--

06:05.755 --> 06:09.024
Rosalind Franklin,
my personal hero.

06:09.092 --> 06:11.360
- Brava, doctor.
- Thank you.

06:11.428 --> 06:13.630
Oh, it's like watching
<i>Golden Gossip Girls.</i>

06:17.568 --> 06:19.469
I'll go do something.

06:19.537 --> 06:21.037
Thank you.

06:22.573 --> 06:24.240
Artie...

06:24.308 --> 06:27.510
I really enjoyed our walk.

06:27.578 --> 06:30.180
The one we took--
Me too.

06:30.248 --> 06:33.850
It was probably the best
walk I ever...walked.

06:33.918 --> 06:38.055
In fact, it was
such a successful promenade

06:38.122 --> 06:40.891
that I was thinking perhaps...

06:40.958 --> 06:42.359
We should take it
to the next level?

06:42.427 --> 06:43.894
A jog?

06:43.962 --> 06:45.829
Well, you know,
I-I could buy shorts.

06:45.897 --> 06:48.099
Artie, I was kidding.

06:48.167 --> 06:50.335
I think dinner
would be nice.

06:50.402 --> 06:51.536
Right.

06:51.604 --> 06:52.771
When we get to
the bottom of this.

06:52.838 --> 06:53.772
Of course.

06:53.839 --> 06:55.440
Of course.

06:55.508 --> 06:57.909
This will prove
that we didn't do anything.

06:57.977 --> 06:59.410
- You got it?
- I know how

06:59.478 --> 07:00.945
the durational spectrometer
works.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.113
No, it's--it's the--
okay. All right.

07:03.181 --> 07:05.148
Right? And this--okay.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.083
There ya go.
Fast-forward, will you?

07:07.151 --> 07:09.118
Okay.

07:09.186 --> 07:10.653
Okay, so far so...

07:10.721 --> 07:13.222
You know, we're just...
Great.

07:13.290 --> 07:15.158
Oh...Look,
we're--we're spooning.

07:15.225 --> 07:17.327
No. We're not.

07:17.394 --> 07:18.928
I'm fast-forwarding.
All right.

07:18.996 --> 07:21.698
- Are you drooling?
- That's sweat.

07:21.766 --> 07:23.801
Look at you.
You're, like, wrestling.

07:23.868 --> 07:25.303
You're a bed hog!
I know.

07:26.705 --> 07:28.740
Ooh! Almost saw
one of the tetons.

07:30.343 --> 07:33.011
Well...
This is not funny!

07:33.079 --> 07:35.247
Could be.
Could be.

07:37.151 --> 07:38.417
Were you making
a phone call?

07:38.485 --> 07:41.486
Uh, yeah.
Maybe I ordered a pizza.

07:41.554 --> 07:44.689
Well, nada on the nooky.

07:44.757 --> 07:46.791
But this only shows
the last five hours.

07:46.859 --> 07:49.361
I mean, stuff could have
happened before...that.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.762
Okay, but who did I call,

07:50.830 --> 07:53.498
and what does
Artie's toothbrush mean?

07:56.801 --> 07:58.802
Artie.
What's going on there?

07:58.870 --> 08:00.838
- Nothing! Nobody had sex.
- What?

08:00.906 --> 08:02.673
Nothing.
Just me jokin' around!

08:02.741 --> 08:04.108
Jokin' around!

08:04.176 --> 08:07.078
- Why are you calling?
- I'm returning your call.

08:07.146 --> 08:08.880
We didn't call you, Artie.

08:08.948 --> 08:10.817
That wasn't Pete singing
the <i>Pina Colada</i> song

08:10.884 --> 08:12.752
on my voicemail
at 3:00 in the morning?

08:12.820 --> 08:14.153
Oh!

08:14.221 --> 08:15.855
That!
Right. Yeah.

08:15.923 --> 08:17.290
- Yeah, well...
- Well...

08:17.358 --> 08:19.793
Do you like...
taking walks in the rain?

08:19.861 --> 08:21.662
It--

08:21.730 --> 08:23.431
Myka, did you do something
to your hair?

08:23.499 --> 08:25.434
No. It always
looks like this.

08:25.502 --> 08:28.638
Artie, um, does your
toothbrush mean anything to you?

08:28.706 --> 08:30.606
In the sense that it
fights plaque and gingivitis,

08:30.674 --> 08:32.708
it means a great deal to me.

08:32.775 --> 08:34.744
You're--hello?

08:34.812 --> 08:37.947
There is only one explanation
for all of us.

08:38.015 --> 08:41.116
Aha! Several disturbances
in the stacks.

08:41.183 --> 08:43.318
See? It was an artifact
that affected us.

08:43.385 --> 08:44.953
All right, well,
let's check 'em out

08:45.021 --> 08:47.555
and see if one of them
whammyed us into...

08:47.623 --> 08:48.823
Whammying each other.

08:48.891 --> 08:51.325
We did not whammy
each other, okay?

08:51.393 --> 08:54.228
And I will prove it,
or I will die trying.

08:54.296 --> 08:56.297
Where are my shoes?

08:56.364 --> 08:58.332
Hey, where's Steve?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.134
Yeah, I don't know.
Uh...

09:00.202 --> 09:02.170
I'll call him.
He always answers his cell.

09:10.113 --> 09:11.748
That's not good.

09:11.815 --> 09:14.017
Nope. No, it's not.

09:18.756 --> 09:20.057
That's a lotta
Scrabble points.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.726
It's the genome sequence
of the last victim.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.594
Hmm. This doesn't make sense.

09:24.662 --> 09:26.696
That--that can't be right.
I mean, that...

09:26.764 --> 09:28.231
That's not--

09:28.299 --> 09:29.699
that's not even...
What?

09:29.767 --> 09:31.902
Human. Those are not
human DNA sequences.

09:31.970 --> 09:33.571
You know, people, plants,
animals--

09:33.639 --> 09:35.206
we're all carbon-based.

09:35.273 --> 09:38.042
Carbon bonded with other
elements makes up what we are,

09:38.110 --> 09:40.378
but those gene sequences
are silicon-based or...

09:40.445 --> 09:42.347
If this is a virus
and that's accurate,

09:42.414 --> 09:45.116
it's actually changing
their DNA.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.852
Do you see it?

09:46.919 --> 09:49.956
See what?

09:50.023 --> 09:51.424
See? It's a pattern.

09:51.492 --> 09:54.828
And it just repeats...

09:54.895 --> 09:57.364
There.
There, you see it now.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.932
No.
Okay.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.336
Whoa. How'd you see that?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.205
Just an old habit
from my code-breaking days

10:06.272 --> 10:08.206
at the NSA.
Code.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.208
That's computer code.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.276
Of course!

10:12.344 --> 10:14.545
It's a computer virus!

10:14.613 --> 10:17.048
But computer viruses
only affect computers.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.415
They don't affect people.

10:18.483 --> 10:21.385
Unless it's super-sized
by an artifact.

10:21.453 --> 10:24.656
We are facing a diabolical
nexus of computer science

10:24.723 --> 10:27.025
and genetic engineering
run amok

10:27.092 --> 10:29.927
that could threaten the very
idea of life as we know it.

10:33.098 --> 10:34.832
One of you's got to be
in your bedroom.

10:36.735 --> 10:38.336
Come on.

10:38.403 --> 10:40.504
Ah, Davina, my favorite.

10:44.142 --> 10:51.914
♪ ♪

10:56.987 --> 10:59.289
Oh ha ha.

11:16.103 --> 11:18.071
- Artie!
- Hugo!

11:18.139 --> 11:19.839
Claudia!

11:19.907 --> 11:22.675
Thank you so much for coming
to Utah on such short notice.

11:22.743 --> 11:25.211
What, are you kidding?
I'm positively salivating

11:25.278 --> 11:29.681
at a concept of a computer virus
hybridization.

11:29.749 --> 11:31.749
And of course I'd do anything
for an old friend

11:31.817 --> 11:35.586
who put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

11:37.622 --> 11:41.226
Hugo, uh...
Let me introduce you to

11:41.293 --> 11:43.128
Dr. Calder--
Vee?

11:43.196 --> 11:45.631
Hello, Huey.

11:45.698 --> 11:48.834
Vee.

11:52.573 --> 11:56.109
<i>Der</i> plot thickens.

11:56.177 --> 11:58.011
I still cannot believe
that it's really you.

11:58.079 --> 12:00.046
Well, it's really me.

12:00.113 --> 12:01.981
Look at you.
You still have that same jacket.

12:02.048 --> 12:03.549
- Yeah. Groovy, isn't it?
- Yeah.

12:03.617 --> 12:06.552
- Never went out of style.
- He's a regular fashionista.

12:06.619 --> 12:08.554
Says Artie
in the bad jacket.

12:08.622 --> 12:10.723
Oh, and you still
have a way with the words.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.491
And you had a way
with me, Vee.

12:12.559 --> 12:14.326
"Cough cough,"
says Artie and Claudia.

12:14.394 --> 12:15.761
- No, no, it's...
- I'm sorry.

12:15.829 --> 12:18.597
I'm just surprised
as all get out to see Vee.

12:18.664 --> 12:20.866
We started at the Warehouse
about the same time.

12:20.934 --> 12:23.235
Remember how we used
to hang out in the dark vault,

12:23.303 --> 12:25.137
play records?

12:25.204 --> 12:27.105
You and me and...

12:27.173 --> 12:29.608
Mary Jane?

12:29.675 --> 12:31.843
What we had an agent
named Mary Jane? I don't--

12:31.911 --> 12:34.512
Good God,
where did you come from?

12:34.580 --> 12:35.680
What?

12:35.748 --> 12:37.716
Dr. Calder,
we have another victim.

12:45.425 --> 12:47.426
Tesla 315.

12:47.494 --> 12:50.429
This is where the first artifact
was disturbed.

12:50.497 --> 12:52.364
Yo! Steve-ero!

12:52.432 --> 12:55.701
Steve?

12:55.769 --> 12:58.003
I don't know. I just--
I think it's a wild--

12:58.071 --> 12:59.038
Aah! Jeez!

12:59.105 --> 13:00.439
Oh, God! Jeez!

13:00.507 --> 13:01.573
Ow ow ow!

13:01.641 --> 13:06.145
The target coil
is still on.

13:06.212 --> 13:08.047
Target practice.
That's it.

13:08.114 --> 13:10.149
That's it. We were havin'
target practice, remember?

13:10.216 --> 13:11.450
Yes, we were talking.

13:11.518 --> 13:12.885
He had just mentioned
that he was gay,

13:12.953 --> 13:15.120
and you were being you.

13:15.188 --> 13:18.391
Oh, my God, you're gay?

13:18.458 --> 13:20.359
Finally! Thank God.

13:20.427 --> 13:22.628
There's someone
to appreciate all this.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.797
It's a waste of time
working out for these people.

13:24.865 --> 13:25.964
Here,
I'll take my shirt off.

13:26.032 --> 13:27.600
No! No, thanks.

13:27.667 --> 13:28.901
No, hey, anytime, man.

13:28.969 --> 13:30.269
You know,
I spend a lot of time on

13:30.337 --> 13:34.139
you know, the guns
and pack and, I, you know...

13:34.207 --> 13:36.108
Pete, I'm really good.
I'm good, really.

13:36.176 --> 13:37.610
No, dude, I'm straight.
It's cool, man.

13:37.677 --> 13:38.944
Take--take it in.

13:39.012 --> 13:41.981
Pete,
put your shirt back on.

13:42.049 --> 13:42.982
Anytime.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.050
It's cool.

13:44.117 --> 13:45.217
The coil's hot.

13:45.285 --> 13:46.285
Would you--would you
like to--

13:46.353 --> 13:47.286
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.460
Well, not bad
if you were trying to miss.

13:56.729 --> 13:57.863
Firing a ray gun
isn't as easy

13:57.931 --> 13:59.232
as it looks
in the movies.

13:59.299 --> 14:00.533
No, hey, no!

14:00.601 --> 14:03.370
It is very hard to fire
ray guns in the movies.

14:03.438 --> 14:05.306
How many times you see
a storm trooper

14:05.374 --> 14:06.440
hit what he's firing at?

14:06.508 --> 14:08.142
Not once.

14:09.478 --> 14:11.146
Hoo!

14:11.213 --> 14:12.948
Hoo-ah!

14:13.015 --> 14:14.082
That's not bad.

14:14.150 --> 14:16.118
Hoo hoo! Not bad?

14:16.185 --> 14:18.553
Woman, I got mad skills.

14:18.621 --> 14:19.988
Don't they need
to recharge?

14:20.056 --> 14:21.189
Well, Claudia
gave them an upgrade.

14:21.257 --> 14:22.257
Oh.

14:22.324 --> 14:23.258
Watch and learn, rookies.

14:23.325 --> 14:24.692
Sha-bam!

14:24.760 --> 14:27.928
- The shelf.
- Pete!

14:27.996 --> 14:29.496
Grab that one!

14:29.564 --> 14:31.598
I got it!

14:32.767 --> 14:34.034
I think they came
from up there.

14:34.101 --> 14:36.236
Yeah, so we should
put them back.

14:36.303 --> 14:39.673
Listen, no more
fooling around.

14:55.525 --> 14:56.692
Pete, look.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.662
We did get drunk...

14:59.729 --> 15:01.063
Sort of.

15:01.131 --> 15:03.098
No, no, 'cause
if I'd have gotten drunk,

15:03.166 --> 15:04.300
I'd have slept
with somebody.

15:05.502 --> 15:07.369
The number of victims
are increasing.

15:07.437 --> 15:08.838
Did you find anything,
Hugo?

15:08.905 --> 15:11.640
Yes. The computer virus
is literally rewriting

15:11.708 --> 15:13.575
this young woman's DNA.

15:13.643 --> 15:15.544
I could spend a lifetime
studying its effects.

15:15.611 --> 15:17.512
This reminds me of the case

15:17.580 --> 15:19.114
involving
D.B. Cooper's parachute.

15:19.181 --> 15:20.315
Oh, that was
a weird one,

15:20.383 --> 15:22.017
even by Warehouse standards.

15:22.085 --> 15:24.820
Weird and wonderful
as I recall.

15:24.888 --> 15:28.624
We have a lot of work
to do, Agent Miller.

15:28.692 --> 15:30.293
Um, how do we reverse
this process?

15:30.361 --> 15:31.862
Well, we have to find
the artifact.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.130
If we can discover

15:33.198 --> 15:35.466
how it made the computer virus
communicable,

15:35.534 --> 15:38.669
I could write an antivirus
and we can disseminate a cure.

15:38.737 --> 15:39.904
Ta-dah!

15:39.971 --> 15:43.307
So, Vee and I will
put our heads together,

15:43.375 --> 15:45.543
analyze
its genetic structure,

15:45.610 --> 15:47.945
you and Claudia check out
the young woman's apartment.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.014
Maybe you'll get lucky
and, uh,

15:50.081 --> 15:53.418
find a clue as to
the artifact's whereabouts.

15:53.485 --> 15:54.819
Oh, that's good.
That's fine.

15:54.887 --> 15:58.122
Um, I think that you've
got a firm grip on things here.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.897
So W.C. Fields'
juggling balls

16:06.965 --> 16:08.900
make you drunk
and pass out.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.002
How come
every other artifact

16:11.069 --> 16:12.937
makes me
have to call my sponsor?

16:13.005 --> 16:17.275
Okay, according to the log,
we disturbed that one too.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.044
Walt Disney's paint brush.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.678
Wow.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.914
Oh, hey, look.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.349
Marilyn Monroe's hairbrush.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.650
This explains that.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.687
Pete?

16:28.754 --> 16:29.821
Yeah?

16:29.889 --> 16:30.822
Look.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.027
Steve's Tesla.

16:40.365 --> 16:43.934
This is so much cheaper
than a salon.

16:46.004 --> 16:47.538
Hey, Myka?

16:47.606 --> 16:48.772
Yeah?

16:48.840 --> 16:49.773
Look.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.349
Where you guys been?

16:58.417 --> 16:59.518
What happened
to target practice?

16:59.585 --> 17:00.786
♪ Happy Birthday ♪

17:00.854 --> 17:03.956
♪ Mr. Secret Service Agent ♪

17:05.291 --> 17:07.527
Uh, should you guys
be touching that?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.863
Uh-oh, it's
the human lie detector.

17:09.931 --> 17:12.132
Better not tell a fib.
Ooh!

17:12.200 --> 17:14.801
Okay, what is this, some sort
of a hazing joke, or...?

17:14.869 --> 17:16.871
Claudia was
right about you, Jinks.

17:16.939 --> 17:18.673
You are a poopy-pants.

17:18.741 --> 17:20.273
Have you guys
been drinking?

17:20.342 --> 17:21.576
No!

17:21.643 --> 17:24.078
I have not had
a single drop of alcohol.

17:24.146 --> 17:25.413
Jeez!

17:25.480 --> 17:27.214
Look, Artie told me
that rule number one

17:27.281 --> 17:28.849
is never playing
with the artifacts,

17:28.917 --> 17:31.418
so why don't we just
put these back?

17:31.486 --> 17:34.054
Stevie, Stevie!

17:34.121 --> 17:36.756
Steve, you know how the
Warehouse is a really big place?

17:36.824 --> 17:39.560
- Uh-huh.
- Like, um...

17:39.627 --> 17:41.428
You want to see something
really cool?

17:41.496 --> 17:42.696
Oh, I don't know.

17:42.764 --> 17:44.164
I think we should probably
get back to--

17:44.232 --> 17:46.568
- Let's go!
- What?

17:46.635 --> 17:50.405
Come on,
Mr. Poopy McPooperson.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.746
We did something to Steve.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.015
Something bad.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.050
Something very bad.

18:01.118 --> 18:02.385
We have to figure out
what it is.

18:14.862 --> 18:17.093
Would a machete help?

18:17.094 --> 18:18.151
Or maybe a chainsaw.

18:18.152 --> 18:20.386
After all,
this is just a crime scene.

18:20.454 --> 18:21.555
Okay, you know what?

18:21.622 --> 18:22.689
Okay, you're
always there for me,

18:22.757 --> 18:23.924
as annoying as that can be,

18:23.991 --> 18:25.025
and that can be
pretty annoying.

18:25.093 --> 18:26.360
So how about we change
things up

18:26.427 --> 18:29.163
and you let me be there for you
for two minutes?

18:31.733 --> 18:32.767
Artie?

18:37.640 --> 18:41.710
Just because Hugo and Vanessa
were an item

18:41.778 --> 18:43.111
back during the Civil War

18:43.179 --> 18:45.347
does not mean
they're getting back together.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.215
You and the doc
have a good thing going.

18:47.283 --> 18:49.383
What thing?
We don't have a thing.

18:49.451 --> 18:50.885
We have one walk.

18:50.953 --> 18:52.720
And I limped.
Artie...

18:52.787 --> 18:57.491
Claudia, I...

18:57.558 --> 19:00.126
Given my line of work

19:00.193 --> 19:03.929
and my advanced years,

19:03.997 --> 19:05.997
I had pretty much
made peace with the fact

19:06.065 --> 19:08.534
that I would not find...

19:08.601 --> 19:13.471
Romantic companionship.

19:13.539 --> 19:15.941
Love.

19:16.008 --> 19:19.177
And then...

19:19.245 --> 19:21.980
Vanessa.

19:22.047 --> 19:26.318
And so I started to hope.

19:26.385 --> 19:28.520
False hope, it would seem.

19:28.588 --> 19:30.088
Artie, it's hope.

19:30.156 --> 19:31.690
How can it be false?

19:31.757 --> 19:33.225
Uh, yeah. Well,
can we just keep looking?

19:33.292 --> 19:34.125
Is that all right
with you?

19:34.193 --> 19:37.662
Okay.

19:37.730 --> 19:38.696
No, not the computer.

19:38.764 --> 19:40.198
No, no, no.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.466
No, no, no,
what do you doing?

19:41.533 --> 19:43.901
From where do you think
a computer virus

19:43.969 --> 19:45.236
is most
likely to originate?

19:45.304 --> 19:46.738
Right. That's
why you're still alive

19:46.805 --> 19:47.972
after all these years.

19:51.477 --> 19:53.878
Wait a second.

19:53.946 --> 19:55.380
Tiger Direct.

19:55.448 --> 19:56.915
Yeah, it's
a computer chain store.

19:56.982 --> 19:59.217
We passed one
on the way here.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.585
Why?
What--what are you doing?

20:00.653 --> 20:02.321
No, don't worry.
My laptop's safe.

20:02.389 --> 20:04.890
Bingo! I just cross-referenced
bank statements

20:04.958 --> 20:06.759
from the other five victims.

20:06.826 --> 20:09.795
They all have credit card
charges from Tiger Direct.

20:09.863 --> 20:11.230
That <i>is</i> bingo.

20:13.166 --> 20:15.501
Time for
Annie's afternoon yoga.

20:19.473 --> 20:21.474
Tyler!

20:21.542 --> 20:22.842
What the heck
were you doing?

20:22.910 --> 20:24.777
Nothing.
I was on my break.

20:24.845 --> 20:27.012
You're busted,
my brother.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.582
Your attitude just wrote
one too many checks

20:29.650 --> 20:31.083
your butt can't cash.

20:31.151 --> 20:33.052
Whoa, uh, excuse me,
Mr. Shreve,

20:33.120 --> 20:34.687
but you can't fire me.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.522
I just cleared it
with H.R.

20:36.590 --> 20:37.924
Enjoy your break...

20:37.992 --> 20:39.926
Forever.

20:39.993 --> 20:42.928
I.E., you're fired.

20:42.996 --> 20:46.031
Oh, fine.

20:47.634 --> 20:49.969
And you know,

20:50.036 --> 20:52.705
only total jerkwads
say "I.E."

21:02.816 --> 21:04.484
Aah!

21:11.425 --> 21:13.092
We need to speak
to the employee

21:13.160 --> 21:14.727
that serviced
these computers.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.863
Uh, these are all
in-home calls.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.164
When it's a home computer,

21:18.232 --> 21:19.599
we send out
one of our Tiger-nicians.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.468
Oh, this explains a lot.

21:21.536 --> 21:22.936
Tyler Struhl.

21:23.004 --> 21:24.504
Tyler Struhl's
one of your--one of your--

21:24.572 --> 21:26.339
Tiger-nician.

21:26.407 --> 21:28.174
And he repaired
these computers

21:28.242 --> 21:29.475
and he's here right now?
Can we talk to him?

21:29.542 --> 21:30.642
I just fired him.

21:30.710 --> 21:32.211
He was totally
not tiger material.

21:32.278 --> 21:33.211
He just left.

21:33.279 --> 21:34.412
What are you do--

21:34.480 --> 21:35.813
oh, right. Okay, go.
I'm on it.

21:35.881 --> 21:37.047
Yeah, go, go, go.

21:37.115 --> 21:38.549
He was hacking
computers.

21:38.616 --> 21:40.284
He was spying on girls

21:40.351 --> 21:42.886
like some techno
Peeping Tom.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.454
Only female victims.

21:44.522 --> 21:46.322
Perv.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.157
Hope I never see
his face again.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.760
Attention,
Tiger Direct shoppers.

21:50.828 --> 21:52.662
What the--

21:52.730 --> 21:54.597
- Let's play 20 questions.
- That's him.

21:54.665 --> 21:56.499
Question one.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.668
Does the store manager,
Colin Shreve,

21:58.736 --> 22:01.971
make his repairmen
use old fiber optic cables

22:02.039 --> 22:05.742
while he sells the new ones
on the side to make cash?

22:05.810 --> 22:08.311
Oh, yes.

22:08.378 --> 22:09.412
Little bastard.

22:09.479 --> 22:11.347
Question two.

22:11.415 --> 22:16.318
Is Colin banging Lydia
in cell phones?

22:16.386 --> 22:19.455
Yes again.

22:19.523 --> 22:21.157
Question 2a.

22:21.225 --> 22:23.058
Does Lydia's boyfriend, Carl,

22:23.126 --> 22:25.795
over in digital cameras
know about it?

22:25.862 --> 22:27.096
He does now.

22:27.163 --> 22:29.031
What?

22:29.099 --> 22:30.833
How is he still
in the system?

22:30.900 --> 22:32.301
I already
changed the password.

22:32.368 --> 22:33.568
And the last question.

22:33.636 --> 22:36.605
Does anybody mind
shopping in the dark?

22:36.672 --> 22:39.007
I don't care, losers!

22:52.021 --> 22:53.922
Oh, my God.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.958
It's beautiful.

22:56.025 --> 22:57.459
Look at it.

22:57.527 --> 23:00.563
Look. Look at it.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.632
Shut your eyes right now.

23:06.871 --> 23:10.040
Ah! Neat!

23:10.107 --> 23:11.474
Are you all right?

23:11.542 --> 23:14.077
Yes.
What is it with the eyes?

23:14.145 --> 23:15.812
The eyes
are the windows to the soul,

23:15.879 --> 23:17.780
but I think also DNA.

23:17.848 --> 23:19.182
Brilliant!

23:19.249 --> 23:22.918
The optical nerve must act
like a coaxial cable,

23:22.986 --> 23:26.955
downloading the virus directly
through the visual cortex.

23:27.023 --> 23:28.791
Yeah.

23:28.859 --> 23:31.628
At least
that's what it feels like.

23:31.696 --> 23:33.797
Oh, my.

23:33.865 --> 23:36.300
It appears I have
once again

23:36.368 --> 23:39.003
looked upon something
I oughtn't have.

23:39.071 --> 23:41.239
Yep.

23:41.307 --> 23:43.141
Lock these doors, officer.

23:43.209 --> 23:44.409
What? Why?
Who the heck are you?

23:44.477 --> 23:46.879
Lock 'em.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.614
Excuse me, everyone, may I
have your attention, please?

23:49.682 --> 23:53.018
My name is
Dr. Vanessa Calder.

23:53.085 --> 23:55.153
I work for the Center
for Disease Control.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.422
We have a situation
here in the store,

23:57.490 --> 23:59.190
and for your own safety,

23:59.258 --> 24:00.858
I can't let anyone
leave here right now.

24:00.926 --> 24:02.093
This is Calder.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.661
Code November.

24:03.729 --> 24:05.630
We have
a potential outbreak.

24:17.050 --> 24:18.283
I tossed
Tyler's apartment.

24:18.351 --> 24:19.817
There's nothing in there,
including Tyler.

24:19.885 --> 24:20.918
Are you okay?

24:20.986 --> 24:23.355
Yeah, I'm...
We're fine.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.656
We're fine.

24:24.723 --> 24:26.791
Uh, listen, Claudia,

24:26.858 --> 24:30.894
we need...
The artifact,

24:30.962 --> 24:32.629
so find him, all right?

24:32.697 --> 24:33.797
Wait, wait, Artie,

24:33.865 --> 24:35.798
I've been looking over
the code he used

24:35.866 --> 24:37.400
when he hacked in,
and to hack in,

24:37.468 --> 24:39.102
he used what's called
a battering ram.

24:39.170 --> 24:40.737
It just smashes through
any firewall.

24:40.805 --> 24:42.939
It's as nasty
as I've ever seen.

24:43.007 --> 24:44.474
This guy's really good.

24:44.542 --> 24:46.076
Yeah, all right, just...

24:46.143 --> 24:47.410
Anybody here know

24:47.478 --> 24:49.980
where would Tyler Struhl go
other than home?

24:50.047 --> 24:52.015
He likes this coffee shop
at Fifth and Archer

24:52.083 --> 24:54.351
to pick up girls.

24:54.418 --> 24:56.286
How do you know that?

24:56.354 --> 24:57.788
I...

24:57.855 --> 24:59.323
I'm already there.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.427
Vanessa.

25:06.197 --> 25:07.130
How you doing, Hugo?

25:07.198 --> 25:10.400
I am doing just fine.

25:10.468 --> 25:13.069
I am construct--

25:13.137 --> 25:16.272
I am constructing
an antivirus,

25:16.340 --> 25:20.443
and as soon
as we have that artifact...

25:23.681 --> 25:26.317
That's your department,
Artie.

25:26.385 --> 25:29.588
We should be able
to cure everyone afflicted.

25:29.655 --> 25:32.291
That's great. Thanks.

25:34.194 --> 25:35.762
Based on
the rate of deterioration

25:35.829 --> 25:37.296
of the previous victims,

25:37.364 --> 25:41.133
everyone in this store
has less than six hours to live,

25:41.201 --> 25:42.668
including Hugo.

25:48.975 --> 25:50.409
This is the last place
to record

25:50.477 --> 25:55.047
an artifact disturbance.

25:55.114 --> 25:58.350
Richard Nixon's shoes
are gone.

25:58.418 --> 26:01.187
So, I don't know.
Maybe I put 'em on

26:01.255 --> 26:03.090
so I could lie to Steve
without him knowing.

26:03.157 --> 26:04.959
We have to find them.

26:05.026 --> 26:06.360
And none of these--

26:06.428 --> 26:09.931
none of these explain
what happened between us.

26:09.998 --> 26:13.734
Look, we aren't
the first platonic friends

26:13.802 --> 26:16.771
to ever get wasted
and end up in bed together.

26:16.839 --> 26:18.439
I would never do that!
I...

26:18.507 --> 26:21.476
God, I don't
think of you that way.

26:21.543 --> 26:24.345
And I don't think
of you that way, either.

26:24.413 --> 26:27.081
It's just
you're my partner

26:27.149 --> 26:29.984
and--and--and my best friend,
okay?

26:30.052 --> 26:31.419
Nothing's gonna change that,

26:31.487 --> 26:35.289
not even us having sex
and forgetting about it, okay?

26:35.357 --> 26:38.559
So just, let's--
let's just forget about it.

26:39.995 --> 26:41.562
Deal?

26:43.565 --> 26:44.732
Deal.

26:44.799 --> 26:45.866
All right.

26:45.934 --> 26:47.801
Okay.

26:47.869 --> 26:50.004
I found Steve.

27:04.352 --> 27:06.653
Wow,
what is this place?

27:06.721 --> 27:09.523
This is the bronze sector,

27:09.591 --> 27:12.426
where we...Bronze stuff.

27:12.493 --> 27:14.528
Mykes! Mykes!
Oh, my God, have you seen 'em?

27:14.596 --> 27:15.895
- Where are they?
- I can't find 'em.

27:15.963 --> 27:17.530
- Can't find what?
- I put some shoes in here.

27:17.598 --> 27:18.898
He has
some favorite shoes.

27:18.966 --> 27:20.100
My favorite shoes.

27:20.167 --> 27:21.367
Uh, those?

27:21.435 --> 27:22.402
We were looking.

27:22.469 --> 27:23.770
You found 'em!

27:23.838 --> 27:25.004
You found my shoes!

27:25.072 --> 27:25.972
- You are so smart.
- Dude!

27:26.040 --> 27:28.374
That is amazing! Aah!

27:28.442 --> 27:29.275
Okay, you want me
to get 'em?

27:29.343 --> 27:30.610
Sure, would you?

27:30.678 --> 27:32.446
That's so awesome of you.

27:32.513 --> 27:34.114
Whoo-hoo!

27:34.182 --> 27:35.749
What is this?

27:35.817 --> 27:37.718
We missed. We missed.

27:37.785 --> 27:39.319
Hey, what is this, man?
It's not cool.

27:39.387 --> 27:40.587
Don't worry, dude.
You'll thank me.

27:40.655 --> 27:44.458
- Why?
- Because...

27:44.526 --> 27:46.660
Probably not!

27:48.731 --> 27:49.831
Ooh!

27:49.899 --> 27:51.366
Oh!

27:51.434 --> 27:54.670
Oh, I should have
told him to smile.

27:54.738 --> 27:56.037
That's okay.
I'll take a picture.

27:56.105 --> 27:57.072
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:57.139 --> 27:58.140
Okay.

28:00.476 --> 28:01.909
Okay, now do me.

28:01.977 --> 28:02.777
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:08.549 --> 28:10.250
Okay, let's
change him back.

28:10.317 --> 28:12.452
Okay.

28:12.519 --> 28:13.619
Okay.

28:13.687 --> 28:15.354
Hmm...

28:15.422 --> 28:16.756
Mm-hmm.

28:18.559 --> 28:19.793
What's that?

28:19.861 --> 28:21.562
- It's a spit lock.
- A what?

28:21.629 --> 28:24.999
It reads the DNA
in your spit.

28:25.067 --> 28:26.100
Cool.

28:28.905 --> 28:30.572
Sample two denied.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.740
Let's do it together.

28:31.808 --> 28:33.042
Let's try it together.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.710
I--oh--

28:34.778 --> 28:36.612
Denied, denied, denied.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.347
Oh, I got it
in my hair.

28:38.415 --> 28:40.049
DNA!

28:40.116 --> 28:42.718
I knew there was a reason
I had his toothbrush,

28:42.785 --> 28:46.455
and I am so glad it wasn't
the reason I thought.

28:50.193 --> 28:53.194
Does anybody mind
shopping in the dark?

28:53.262 --> 28:54.862
Answer...

28:57.532 --> 28:58.499
Hugo?

28:58.567 --> 28:59.901
You all right?

28:59.969 --> 29:01.769
Uh...Ahem.

29:03.939 --> 29:06.007
Thank you.

29:06.075 --> 29:07.876
Oh.

29:07.944 --> 29:09.878
Seems I'm about to give
new meaning

29:09.946 --> 29:12.180
to the phrase "Dirt nap."

29:12.248 --> 29:13.482
You're
not gonna die, Hugo.

29:13.550 --> 29:16.185
We're gonna--we're gonna
figure this thing out.

29:16.253 --> 29:17.553
I know.

29:17.621 --> 29:20.055
I've got a lot to live for.

29:22.058 --> 29:24.659
You know, when I was
in the sanitarium,

29:24.727 --> 29:28.596
I apparently drew the same
picture every single day.

29:28.664 --> 29:31.832
I found one of them
in my wallet

29:31.899 --> 29:34.867
after you restored
my mind last year.

29:34.935 --> 29:37.070
Ahem.

29:37.137 --> 29:38.104
There.

29:41.242 --> 29:42.109
Huh.

29:43.979 --> 29:46.514
So much time lost.

29:46.581 --> 29:48.716
If I had it all back,

29:48.784 --> 29:51.854
I'd spend every second
of it with her.

29:51.921 --> 29:54.189
You'd be a fool not to.

29:54.257 --> 29:57.761
Oh.

29:57.828 --> 30:00.596
Did you ever find
someone, Artie?

30:02.799 --> 30:04.267
<i>Emet.</i>

30:04.335 --> 30:08.138
Oh. I didn't realize
you were homosexual.

30:08.205 --> 30:11.208
Uh, are you
what they call a bear?

30:11.275 --> 30:13.043
No, I don't mean
Emmett, the man.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.745
I'm talking about <i>"Emet."</i>

30:14.813 --> 30:16.313
Look, <i>Emet,</i>
the Hebrew word for "Truth."

30:16.381 --> 30:17.381
It's on his necklace.

30:17.449 --> 30:18.549
What does it mean?

30:18.616 --> 30:23.087
It means
that what we are facing

30:23.154 --> 30:25.990
is the artifact
that's behind the Jewish myth

30:26.057 --> 30:27.558
of the Golem.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.460
16th century Prague,

30:29.528 --> 30:31.496
the Rabbi Judah Loew

30:31.563 --> 30:33.731
wanted to save the Jews
of the ghetto from pogroms,

30:33.799 --> 30:35.400
and so he constructed--

30:35.467 --> 30:39.470
he created a creature--
a Golem--

30:39.538 --> 30:43.741
Hugo,
entirely made of clay.

30:43.809 --> 30:46.410
And he put the word <i>Emet,</i>
truth,

30:46.478 --> 30:48.613
on the Golem's forehead
to bring it to life.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.581
Animating the inanimate.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.850
And I think
maybe the necklace

30:52.918 --> 30:56.754
is making the computer virus
come to life

30:56.822 --> 30:58.456
exactly the same
as the Golem.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.024
Somehow,
I think that the myth

31:00.092 --> 31:02.293
and the virus
got mixed up together,

31:02.361 --> 31:03.594
so that when he uses
the virus

31:03.662 --> 31:05.130
on people's computers...

31:05.198 --> 31:07.298
It turned them to clay.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.634
Well thought out, Artie.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.205
It's the necklace.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.240
I got him.

31:29.620 --> 31:30.654
Oh, my God.

31:38.895 --> 31:39.929
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:39.996 --> 31:41.030
What the hell
are you doing?

31:41.098 --> 31:41.931
Oh, my God!
He's got a gun!

31:41.999 --> 31:43.065
Take it easy, Colin.

31:43.133 --> 31:44.734
No. Whatever this is,

31:44.801 --> 31:47.470
I am not gonna
die from it.

31:47.537 --> 31:48.838
Something in here
is making us sick,

31:48.905 --> 31:50.673
and you are keeping us
in here with it.

31:50.741 --> 31:52.742
- This is for your own safety.
- No, careful, careful.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.110
I'll decide
what's safe for me.

31:54.178 --> 31:55.645
Use your Tesla.

31:55.713 --> 31:56.946
- Claudia's got it.
- Brilliant.

31:57.014 --> 32:00.650
Colin, I can't
let you leave.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.319
I'll shoot you.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.222
You'll have to.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.228
Now the doctor's
got it!

32:10.296 --> 32:11.630
We've gotta
get out of here!

32:11.697 --> 32:13.532
He's right.
We're gonna all get out of here.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.335
The virus is mutating.

32:16.403 --> 32:18.003
It can be transmitted
person to person.

32:18.071 --> 32:19.605
- It's organic.
- Obviously.

32:19.672 --> 32:20.939
We can't let it get
out of this store.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.974
No, no, no.

32:28.112 --> 32:35.017

32:35.085 --> 32:36.719

Okay. All right.

33:17.358 --> 33:18.758
I'm dropping it.

33:18.826 --> 33:19.793
Step away from the door!

33:21.863 --> 33:23.597
This mutation's
working much faster.

33:23.665 --> 33:26.734
It's getting hard
to breathe.

33:26.802 --> 33:28.703
Okay.

33:28.771 --> 33:29.771
I'm a big enough girl
to admit

33:29.839 --> 33:30.939
I'm a little scared.

33:31.007 --> 33:32.975
We need the artifact.

33:33.043 --> 33:34.577
I know, I know,

33:34.644 --> 33:36.312
but she said she's got him.
She's gonna be here.

33:36.379 --> 33:37.780
You've got to finish
the antivirus.

33:37.848 --> 33:39.515
You gotta do it now.
All right, I'll get on it.

33:39.583 --> 33:40.549
Hang on, hang on.

33:46.989 --> 33:48.122
Damn it.

33:50.792 --> 33:52.827
Why are you chasing me?

33:52.894 --> 33:54.728
I'm not chasing you.
I'm falling to my death.

33:54.796 --> 33:56.596
Pull me up!

33:59.234 --> 34:00.301
Thank you.

34:00.368 --> 34:01.902
All I did I was hack
a few P.C.s

34:01.970 --> 34:04.205
to try and catch
a little skin show. That's it.

34:04.273 --> 34:05.506
For all I care,

34:05.574 --> 34:06.908
you can be the biggest
cyber hacker since...

34:06.976 --> 34:08.009
Me.

34:08.077 --> 34:09.511
But I need
that necklace, okay?

34:09.578 --> 34:10.712
It's dangerous.

34:10.780 --> 34:11.947
What are you
talking about?

34:12.014 --> 34:13.482
I don't know
how to explain it to you,

34:13.549 --> 34:14.483
but it's...
It's hurting people.

34:14.551 --> 34:16.118
It's nothing.

34:16.186 --> 34:18.320
It's a thing
that my great uncle gave me

34:18.388 --> 34:19.822
to ward off evil spirits.

34:19.889 --> 34:21.657
Okay. Well, it doesn't
so much ward them off

34:21.725 --> 34:24.960
as invite them over
for a play date.

34:25.027 --> 34:28.463
Well, I didn't mean
for anybody to get hurt.

34:28.531 --> 34:32.333
Well, give me the necklace
and maybe we can fix it.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.501
But why would we
bronze Steve?

34:34.569 --> 34:36.036
I mean, sure,
he's a boy scout

34:36.103 --> 34:37.571
with no sense of humor,
right?

34:37.639 --> 34:40.639
But we've got Nazis in here.

34:40.708 --> 34:42.542
It explains
the toothbrush,

34:42.610 --> 34:45.779
but not how we wound up
in bed together.

34:50.418 --> 34:52.320
Pete, remember?

34:52.388 --> 34:54.389
That thingy--that thingy
with the juggle balls said

34:54.456 --> 34:57.726
that the juggle balls
make you drunk and black out,

34:57.794 --> 34:58.960
and when you black out,

34:59.028 --> 35:00.228
you forget things,
don't you?

35:00.296 --> 35:02.196
Oh, my God!

35:02.264 --> 35:04.231
Holy crap, Wendy!

35:04.299 --> 35:06.600
Oh, my God!

35:06.668 --> 35:08.436
You are so right!

35:08.503 --> 35:13.039
Oh! If we don't remember what
happened to Mr. Poopy-Pants,

35:13.107 --> 35:15.708
he could be lost
in there forever.

35:15.776 --> 35:18.644
Quick!
Take off all your clothes!

35:18.712 --> 35:20.446
- What?
- Take 'em off.

35:20.514 --> 35:23.983
Okay, but sometimes
when big--

35:24.051 --> 35:26.253
when big Pete
drives drunk,

35:26.321 --> 35:28.855
little Pete doesn't
always stay on the road.

35:28.923 --> 35:30.891
Ah.

35:33.061 --> 35:34.461
Ohh!

35:34.529 --> 35:36.497
Just waking up together
wouldn't be enough.

35:36.565 --> 35:38.466
We got into bed naked

35:38.534 --> 35:40.835
so it would look
like we slept together.

35:40.903 --> 35:41.936
Something
that would never...

35:42.004 --> 35:43.704
Ever happen.

35:43.772 --> 35:45.639
Something that I knew
I wouldn't rest

35:45.707 --> 35:47.842
until I proved
it was false.

35:47.909 --> 35:49.577
Which would hopefully
get us to retrace our steps.

35:49.644 --> 35:51.511
And lead us back
down here.

35:54.048 --> 35:55.682
Ready?

35:59.854 --> 36:03.157
Computer voice:
Agent Nielsen identified.

36:13.268 --> 36:15.102
What was that?

36:15.170 --> 36:16.903
What did you guys do to me?
What happened?

36:16.971 --> 36:18.771
What are you talkin' about?

36:18.839 --> 36:20.239
Where the hell
have you been, Jinks?

36:20.306 --> 36:22.441
Shouldn't you be
at target practice?

36:22.508 --> 36:24.542
I'm actually disappointed
in you, Steve.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.577
Shame, shame, shame.

36:26.644 --> 36:28.879
Slacker!

36:28.946 --> 36:31.247
Z-v...

36:31.315 --> 36:33.282
26...

36:33.350 --> 36:37.018
V-8...

36:37.086 --> 36:40.889
Z-26.

36:42.259 --> 36:43.259
What's the matter?

36:43.326 --> 36:44.460
Hugo, you gotta
keep working.

36:44.527 --> 36:45.761
We need the antivirus.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.765
Artie,
I can't see.

36:50.401 --> 36:52.635
Oh, my God.
All right, all right.

36:52.703 --> 36:54.237
If you could just--
you tell me what to do.

36:54.305 --> 36:55.972
Uh...Uh...

36:56.039 --> 36:58.141
Artie, Artie, I need you
to tell Vanessa something.

36:58.209 --> 36:59.642
You can tell her yourself
when you cure her.

36:59.710 --> 37:00.776
Just tell me
what to type.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.111
- All right, z-x...
- Yes, yes.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.111
- Slash...
- Slash.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.247
- V-37...
- V-37.

37:09.353 --> 37:10.687
I'm here.
I have the necklace.

37:10.754 --> 37:11.821
How do I get this to you?

37:11.889 --> 37:14.256
Hold on. I'm coming.

37:14.324 --> 37:16.591
Throw it at the window!

37:16.659 --> 37:18.026
What--why?

37:18.094 --> 37:19.228
It'll just bounce right--

37:19.295 --> 37:20.628
Claudia, just do it.

37:22.064 --> 37:24.065
How's your fastball?

37:30.571 --> 37:31.438
Now!

37:35.643 --> 37:36.643
Great. Come on.

37:39.379 --> 37:40.913
I got it.

37:40.981 --> 37:42.114
How?
How did you get it?

37:42.182 --> 37:43.349
Got it
through the window.

37:43.416 --> 37:46.418
I used the inkwell
of Francois Villon,

37:46.486 --> 37:48.920
15th century poet
and thief.

37:48.988 --> 37:52.524
Bad poet, great thief.

37:52.591 --> 37:54.592
It doesn't matter.
Is the code finished?

37:54.660 --> 37:55.793
Yes, it's finished.

37:55.861 --> 37:57.127
Just hit "enter."

37:57.195 --> 37:58.529
It'll disseminate
the antivirus.

37:58.596 --> 38:01.532
But, Artie, curing
that many people at once,

38:01.599 --> 38:03.467
there's no telling
what'll happen

38:03.534 --> 38:05.802
to the person
wearing the artifact.

38:05.870 --> 38:09.106
You're absolutely right.

38:16.982 --> 38:18.416
Take care of her, Hugo.

38:18.484 --> 38:20.918
Right.

38:26.692 --> 38:29.028
Everyone, look--
look at the screens.

38:47.415 --> 38:49.149
Artie...

38:49.217 --> 38:51.052
You did it!

38:51.119 --> 38:52.320
Artie.

38:54.890 --> 38:57.225
Artie.

39:00.696 --> 39:02.864
Is this heaven?

39:05.000 --> 39:05.833
I guess not.

39:12.156 --> 39:15.324
He didn't know
about the virus, Artie.

39:16.403 --> 39:18.571
Artie! Claudia!
It's all good!

39:18.639 --> 39:20.139
Vee talked to the hospital.

39:20.207 --> 39:21.574
The young woman
is fine.

39:21.642 --> 39:22.675
Oh, great.

39:22.743 --> 39:24.176
- Huh?
- That's wonderful.

39:24.244 --> 39:25.611
- Do we make a team?
- We do.

39:25.679 --> 39:26.912
- All right.
- Yeah.

39:28.582 --> 39:30.416
So you got plans now?

39:30.483 --> 39:33.653
You're--you're probably
goin' back to Eureka.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.121
Eureka? No.

39:35.188 --> 39:37.790
I think I've had just
about enough of that town.

39:37.858 --> 39:39.892
She spent some time there.

39:39.959 --> 39:41.426
Every week, something
seems to go boom.

39:41.494 --> 39:43.094
I mean, I think
I'm gonna look for something

39:43.162 --> 39:44.429
a little more sedate,

39:44.497 --> 39:46.497
a little more peaceful.

39:46.565 --> 39:47.732
Well, I hope
you're happy.

39:47.799 --> 39:50.001
I know I'll be happy.
Was this fun? Aah!

39:50.068 --> 39:52.169

Hi.

40:18.867 --> 40:20.835
I have to go.

Yeah, I know.

that we had dinner plans,

40:33.516 --> 40:36.317
that you know I wish you and
Hugo nothing but the best.

40:36.385 --> 40:37.719
Well, certainly,
if I'm wishing him the best,

40:37.786 --> 40:39.721
I'm wishing him you,

No, we are not.
