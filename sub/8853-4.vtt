08:28.550 --> 08:31.280
Look, Anders,
no, just end--

08:31.320 --> 08:33.720
Anders, look,
I have a sense of humor, okay?

08:33.750 --> 08:35.289
I really do, okay?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.720
I'm funnier than everyone else
in this office.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.960
It's true.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.789
But I laugh when
it's appropriate, okay?

08:40.830 --> 08:43.260
Nights, weekends.
I'll laugh all Sunday long.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.560
I've seen adult swim.
I get alternative comedy.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.400
- Let me just--
- No, we're done.

08:47.430 --> 08:50.030
We're done.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.770
Hey.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.610
With radical change
comes indignation, okay?

08:55.640 --> 08:57.710
Not everyone's gonna get it.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.810
Guess who does get it.

08:59.850 --> 09:01.550
You want to take a guess?

09:01.580 --> 09:03.210
[Sighs]
Do you get it?

09:03.250 --> 09:04.250
Yeah, I get it.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.650
I'm gonna go talk to her.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.320
- No.
- I'm gonna make this happen.

09:07.350 --> 09:09.420
- Jillian, don't.
- I'm gonna do it.

09:09.450 --> 09:12.590
Oh, ho ho!

09:12.620 --> 09:14.060
Looks like you're gonna
have a hard time

09:14.090 --> 09:15.830
getting that promotion now,
dude.

09:15.860 --> 09:18.560
Maybe your weird nipples
can put in a good word for you.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.730
Yeah, remember? Because
your nipples were talking.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.100
Mm-hmm.

09:22.130 --> 09:24.500
Oh, man, we handled you
something fierce.

09:24.540 --> 09:25.740
How's that make you feel?

09:25.770 --> 09:26.900
Yeah, honestly, that hurts.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.240
It hurts pretty bad.

09:29.270 --> 09:30.640
I mean, so break something.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.140
Go crazy.
Come on. It's cool.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.950
You know, at the house,
I get it.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.250
It's fair.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.680
But when you bring it
into the office,

09:36.720 --> 09:38.020
you're crossing a line, okay?

09:38.050 --> 09:39.620
You're messing with my job.

09:39.650 --> 09:42.520
But if you guys want
to step on me to get ahead,

09:42.560 --> 09:45.490
that's fine, but why would I
want to be your friend?

09:45.530 --> 09:46.930
Anders, it was just
an awesome prank

09:46.960 --> 09:49.100
that was super well crafted.
Thank you.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.470
No, man.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.730
I don't want anything
to do with you guys anymore.

09:52.770 --> 09:55.670
All right? I'm putting my two
weeks in and I'm moving out.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.810
What?

09:58.840 --> 10:02.380
I won't continue
to live in fear.

10:04.510 --> 10:06.810
- Okay.
- Wow.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.380
Ders.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.550
Come on, dude.

10:09.590 --> 10:10.620
You can't just move out.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.490
Not without talking about it.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.220
Look, all right,
we took it too far today,

10:14.260 --> 10:15.660
but we're really, really sorry.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.460
Right, Adam?

10:17.490 --> 10:18.990
Adam?

10:19.030 --> 10:21.360
Yeah.
I'm so sorry, Anders.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.370
God, I'm sorry.
For what we've done.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.970
Are you serious?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.640
Said we're sorry, dude.
What more do you want?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.570
Is he really moving out
right now?

10:31.610 --> 10:35.380
Yes. This stupid promotion's
gonna cost us our best friend.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.080
And rent split two ways

10:37.110 --> 10:38.850
is, like, three times
more expensive.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.380
Yeah.

10:40.420 --> 10:42.820
I think I'm actually
gonna miss him, you know?

10:42.850 --> 10:45.320
We got to get ders
that promotion.

10:45.350 --> 10:48.390
Or we can just
give me the promotion

10:48.420 --> 10:52.130
because I'm the best
and ders sucks, right?

10:52.160 --> 10:54.360
No.
We'll blow our interviews.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.730
That way Alice will know

10:55.770 --> 10:57.100
ders is the only man
for the job.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.070
Yes. I like that plan
better than mine.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.340
All right, buzz,
what do you say? To infinity...

11:01.370 --> 11:02.340
I'm Woody.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.770
- Wait.
- What?

11:03.810 --> 11:05.180
No.
No, you're definitely buzz.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.710
- No, I'm Woody.
- No, you're buzz.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.510
- Buzz is the astronaut?
- Tim Allen.

11:08.550 --> 11:11.220
Okay, yeah, I'll be him.
He's cool. Beyond.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.490
Actually,
uh, I'm not really cool

11:13.520 --> 11:16.190
with the amount
of responsibility I have now.

11:16.220 --> 11:19.160
So if you wanted
to promote me down a peg,

11:19.190 --> 11:20.690
I'd be cool for that.

11:20.730 --> 11:22.360
This isn't my style, you know?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.160
Anders would love
something like this.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.900
Something this small.
Of this magnitude.

11:26.930 --> 11:29.970
I'm not sure I would be
the number one pick

11:30.000 --> 11:32.370
to be...
To be a boss around here,

11:32.410 --> 11:35.040
because I think you
would find me snacking a lot.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.140
Did you see the charts?

11:36.180 --> 11:37.510
Have you seen him in a suit?

11:37.540 --> 11:39.010
He's gonna
keep his hair forever.

11:39.050 --> 11:40.710
I was mowing the yard
without tennis shoes.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.650
And ders came out
with my tennis shoes.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.780
[Imitates flatulence]

11:44.820 --> 11:46.150
He put them on my feet for me

11:46.190 --> 11:48.320
because I was having
sciatica pain.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.560
This is awesome.

11:49.590 --> 11:50.720
Oh, oh, he's biting my dick!

11:50.760 --> 11:51.790
[Laughs]

11:51.830 --> 11:52.990
Choose Anders.
Okay.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.500
Hey.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.100
Yo.

11:59.130 --> 12:00.900
Hi.

12:00.930 --> 12:04.440
So I, uh, got the promotion.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.340
- Yes!
- That's great.

12:06.370 --> 12:08.110
I am so proud of you.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.770
Congratulations.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.210
Great.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.440
Alice told me you guys
put in a good word,

12:12.480 --> 12:13.510
so I appreciate it.

12:13.550 --> 12:15.380
Nah, it was all you, buddy.

12:15.410 --> 12:18.920
Yeah, we did help out a lot,
but it was you.

12:18.950 --> 12:21.220
So?
Are you still moving out,

12:21.260 --> 12:23.260
or are we all good?

12:23.290 --> 12:26.060
[Laughs]

12:26.090 --> 12:28.800
This is just...
I want to savor this.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.800
Um, 'cause this is adorable.

12:30.830 --> 12:32.370
Yeah.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.430
What's adorable?

12:33.470 --> 12:35.900
Your tender innocence.

12:35.940 --> 12:38.110
His sweet naivete.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.470
What?

12:39.510 --> 12:42.610
I was never gonna move out,
you damn fools.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.940
[Laughs]

12:43.980 --> 12:46.750
It's called the long con, okay?

12:46.780 --> 12:47.980
You know, it's weird.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.480
For a second,
I thought you guys

12:49.520 --> 12:51.080
were gonna be smart fish,
go under the boat,

12:51.120 --> 12:52.820
but, no, you bit hard.

12:52.850 --> 12:54.220
Hook, line, and sinker.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.890
How long have you
been conning us for?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.860
Since, like,
yesterday at 3:00.

12:57.890 --> 13:00.160
- That's not long.
- Not long.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.230
Well, it's longer than
any con you've ever pulled.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.460
Uh, I've got a con
from last year

13:03.500 --> 13:04.460
you don't even know about.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.070
Ders, you were crying.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.570
Part of the con.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.800
Those were real tears.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.340
- Were they?
- Yeah, they were.

13:10.370 --> 13:12.310
It's like when you watch
Tupac videos online,

13:12.340 --> 13:15.110
and you're like, "we need
to start making some changes.

13:15.140 --> 13:16.910
Change the way we eat."

13:16.940 --> 13:18.480
Okay, for the record, we do.

13:18.510 --> 13:21.310
And things are gonna start
changing around here

13:21.350 --> 13:23.650
starting tomorrow.

13:28.290 --> 13:31.760
- Did he just--
- Yeah, he just Tupac walked us.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:40.220 --> 13:41.720
20 minutes late.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.850
That doesn't make me
look good at all.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.090
Well, you took the car,

13:45.120 --> 13:46.250
so we had to share
my roller blades.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.920
Bosses ride alone.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.560
Nice suit, by the way.

13:49.590 --> 13:52.330
What, did you get drafted
by the Denver nuggets?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.600
Look like you're ready
to sell me a Honda sol.

13:54.630 --> 13:55.730
I'm the senior
sales associate now.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.370
Do you know what that means?

13:57.400 --> 14:00.400
That means I have jurisdiction
over the have-nots,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.440
the great unwashed, you guys.

14:02.470 --> 14:04.870
I'm your boss.
You have to follow my rules.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.770
Did you wet your hair down
to come talk to us?

14:06.810 --> 14:08.480
- I didn't wet--
- No, you did. Obviously.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.750
You obviously did.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.980
Why don't we go to my office,
okay?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.950
You guys can see
my ergonomic keyboard,

14:14.990 --> 14:16.790
my wireless mouse,

14:16.820 --> 14:18.420
and I'm gonna think
of all sorts of thininings

14:18.460 --> 14:19.820
for you guys to do today.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.530
Are my worker bees
ready to buzz the hive?

14:23.560 --> 14:24.730
Yeah, back and forth.
Short strokes.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.100
Make sure you feel the bristles

14:26.130 --> 14:27.530
massaging the carpet.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.600
That's how you're gonna clean.

14:28.630 --> 14:29.600
Is that a personal call?

14:29.630 --> 14:30.970
Please hang it up.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.670
I've been promoted!

14:32.700 --> 14:34.270
See the suit?

14:34.300 --> 14:35.340
You getting in there?

14:35.370 --> 14:36.500
Yeah.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.570
Come on.
I want to hear it.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.910
Hey, Cynthia.
Is that a personal call?

14:40.940 --> 14:42.440
Please hang it up.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.710
Sit your ass down right now.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.450
Hang it up.
Hang it up.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.020
Great. Thanks.
Any sales today?

14:50.050 --> 14:54.220
I let Cynthia go today.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.530
That was rough.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.440
Oh, guys.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.470
Still working hard.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.470
That shows a lot of fortitude.

15:08.510 --> 15:10.440
That's gonna go
a long way with me.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.440
Really happy to see this.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.810
Oh, hey, Alice.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.950
You see these guys
just slaving away?

15:14.980 --> 15:16.310
Really being team players.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.350
Wow. Yeah.
Nobody cares.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.180
Look, um, the cutco reps

15:20.220 --> 15:21.790
are gonna be here
at 10:00 a.M. Tomorrow,

15:21.820 --> 15:23.390
so I need
the conference room prepped.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.660
Right. Okay.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.360
And lay off the styling gel,
Bradley Cooper.

15:27.390 --> 15:30.630
Wow. Bradley Cooper.
Thank you.

15:30.660 --> 15:31.630
You hear that?

15:31.660 --> 15:34.000
Um, look, to celebrate today

15:34.030 --> 15:36.370
and the long and fruitful
relationship

15:36.400 --> 15:37.840
we're going to have,

15:37.870 --> 15:40.470
I clocked a resie at
a chic little bistro uptown,

15:40.510 --> 15:42.710
so tuck your shirts in.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.910
It's a hip crowd.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.150
[Baby cries]

15:47.180 --> 15:48.680
How about that meatloaf, Blake?

15:48.720 --> 15:50.420
Pretty good after
you slather it in ketchup.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.880
Yeah?
Well, chowhound said

15:51.920 --> 15:53.690
it's decadent and moist
enough, so...

15:53.720 --> 15:55.190
They nailed that, man.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.650
Are you guys sure you don't
want any of these egg rolls?

15:56.690 --> 15:59.420
They're Texas Mexican.
No. Stuffed, boss.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.160
Yeah, let's just get
some more drinks, huh?

16:01.190 --> 16:04.060
That's what I'm talking about.
Garcon?

16:04.100 --> 16:05.930
[Whistles]
Where is this guy?

16:05.960 --> 16:06.930
Yes, sir.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.900
"Sir."
I love this kid.

16:08.930 --> 16:11.800
Uh, first of all, I'd like
to see the chef face to face.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.540
These are the best cajun chicken
niblets I've ever had.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.410
Uh, yeah.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.940
- Great. Hey.
[Whistles]

16:17.980 --> 16:19.780
Um, also, we're gonna
want to get dessert.

16:19.810 --> 16:21.810
I'm wondering
which wine pairs best

16:21.850 --> 16:23.880
with the oreo cheesecake.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.420
I don't--
I wouldn't know that.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.180
You don't know.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.990
Okay, perhaps you should
send over the house Somalian.

16:30.020 --> 16:31.960
Uh, Greg is from Nigeria.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.260
No, I don't mean Craig.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.660
I don't see how this helps us.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.730
I just want cheesecake
with a good wine.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.460
Okay, let's skip dessert and
just get some more drinks, huh?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.130
Yeah, we got
some celebrating to do.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.330
Indeed.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.030
So, uh, ders, come on,

16:44.070 --> 16:46.240
tell us what's it like
to be on top of the world.

16:46.270 --> 16:47.510
Honestly, this is great.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.210
I feel terrific.
I look great.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.180
Wearing a suit to the office,
no joke,

16:52.210 --> 16:54.680
it makes you better than
everyone else there.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.320
To our best friend,
who we'll never betray. Ever.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.780
Let's talk business, guys.

16:58.820 --> 17:00.850
Are you guys familiar
with vertical integration?

17:00.890 --> 17:02.860
You got to look
at your bottom line.

17:02.890 --> 17:04.490
There's net,
and there's <i>net</i> net.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.829
Here's the thing.
Now that I'm in charge,

17:06.859 --> 17:08.829
get on my coattails.

17:08.859 --> 17:10.800
You can't be messing around
at the office.

17:10.829 --> 17:11.900
I look at it this way.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.270
Promotion, car, wife.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.630
We're gonna change things up
around the office.

17:16.670 --> 17:19.599
I'm gonna let Alice know
who's in charge now.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.839
Let's keep things the same.

17:20.869 --> 17:23.040
Oh, my God!
What is this?

17:23.079 --> 17:25.109
That's what we call
diversifying.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.750
Do you even know karate?

17:26.780 --> 17:28.349
Two, three...

17:28.380 --> 17:29.550
Get used to this.

17:29.580 --> 17:34.050
[Belches loudly]

17:34.090 --> 17:36.220
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

17:36.260 --> 17:39.790
Can a mother[Bleep]
Get the check, please?

17:39.830 --> 17:40.790
Who are you?

17:40.830 --> 17:42.400
You asked to see me.

17:42.430 --> 17:44.000
I made your
cajun chicken niblets.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.670
No, no, no.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.570
You made my year.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.700
You have a gift.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.710
And a super-dope hat.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.170
This is cool.

17:55.210 --> 17:58.880
All right, boys.
Let's go.

18:09.390 --> 18:10.690
[Screams]

18:18.260 --> 18:20.600
[Screams]

18:23.000 --> 18:24.100
[Grunts]

18:24.130 --> 18:26.630
Hi, are you the locksmith?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.040
I'm glad you think
it's hilarious,

18:28.070 --> 18:29.240
but I need to get it
off my neck!

18:29.270 --> 18:32.510
[Screams]
Come on!

18:35.440 --> 18:36.750
Okay.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.380
Looks like we got this
all settled up,

18:38.410 --> 18:40.780
so I'm gonna go ahead
and get two dozen

18:40.820 --> 18:43.420
throwing stars
out to your residence

18:43.450 --> 18:45.490
in bellevue, Nebraska.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.090
You're gonna enjoy that,
Mr. Johnson.

18:48.130 --> 18:50.490
Thank you.
Okay, I love you too. . Thanks.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.660
- Good morning.
- Whoa. You are late.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.960
Yes, because you stole my car.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.070
Well, bosses ride alone, right?

18:59.100 --> 19:00.670
I'm guessing you guys

19:00.700 --> 19:02.140
didn't bring the key to this
to the office.

19:02.170 --> 19:05.070
Uh, no,
actually the key is here.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.070
It's--it's in our cubicle.

19:07.110 --> 19:11.910
Yeah, and you're actually
pretty warm right now, Anders.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.580
Both:
Warmer.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.520
Yes. Yes. There we go.
The chase is on.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.420
There you go.
Anders on the hunt.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.020
You are warm.
Search, search, search.

19:20.060 --> 19:21.560
Keeping it warm.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.560
You're a little bit
cooled down.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.060
Guys, I have to prep
the conference room

19:25.100 --> 19:26.500
in, like, five seconds.

19:26.530 --> 19:27.770
Dude, you're really close.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.100
Yeah. Keep--
believe in yourself.

19:30.130 --> 19:31.100
[Clears throat]

19:31.140 --> 19:32.440
Hey, Alice.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.070
Anders.

19:34.110 --> 19:35.770
Morning.

19:35.810 --> 19:38.240
The, um, clients are here.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.950
Yeah. Hey.
Anders holmvic. Welcome.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.380
Interesting name.
Are you Finnish?

19:42.410 --> 19:44.450
No, sir.
I'm just getting started.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.050
[Nervous laughter]

19:46.080 --> 19:50.690
Okay, uh, Anders is our
newest sales representative.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.590
So...

19:52.620 --> 19:54.890
Why don't, um, you go ahead and
head into the conference room,

19:54.930 --> 19:56.730
and I'll meet you there
in just a minute, okay?

19:56.760 --> 19:58.830
Yeah, I was just gonna say
let's go to the conference room.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.760
No, you aren't going anywhere.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.170
I just want
to congratulate you, Anders,

20:03.200 --> 20:06.370
'cause you made it
24 whole hours.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.340
Give me the executive
bathroom key now.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.740
Anders, you have a...

20:15.780 --> 20:17.680
[Clears throat] A little...

20:17.710 --> 20:19.050
- Yeah.
- ...Bike lock right here.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.680
I know, Jillian.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.650
I could just tell
it was bothering Alice, so...

20:22.690 --> 20:23.850
- Yeah. Great.
- All right.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.320
Thanks a lot.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.290
Okay, you guys have won.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.760
Now please give me the keys.

20:29.790 --> 20:33.100
Both:
Colder.

20:33.130 --> 20:34.760
Colder.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.430
- Ooh.
- Ice cold.

20:36.470 --> 20:37.870
- Really cold.
- Oh, that is so cold.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.140
Wait a second.

20:39.170 --> 20:41.410
If this is the key
to the bathroom

20:41.440 --> 20:43.310
on the bike lock key chain,

20:43.340 --> 20:46.280
then that means
that you just gave away...

20:46.310 --> 20:48.280
Oh, you get it.
Now you get it.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.180
He's no dummy.
He's no dummy.

20:50.220 --> 20:51.980
We got you, bro!

20:52.020 --> 20:53.820
Those wheels are a-turning.

20:53.850 --> 20:55.220
Ders.
