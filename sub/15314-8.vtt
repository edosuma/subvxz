Dominus tecum
Benedicta tu...

00:05.247 --> 00:08.106
Are the men ready to cause
chaos in Clun? Yes, my lord.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.408
This scheme sounds elaborate.

00:10.982 --> 00:15.341
Stop whining, Gisborne. If I'd wanted a wife,
I would have found one with better legs.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.932
Trust me, Carter is a godsend.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.344
Shoulders back.
He kills people for fun.

00:21.559 --> 00:22.605
Then why are we paying him?

00:24.612 --> 00:27.312
Fun... and money.

00:45.903 --> 00:47.025
Look at the hands!

00:56.758 --> 00:59.690
Ah, morning, Carter.
This is Gisborne.

01:03.242 --> 01:04.245
My Lord Sheriff.

01:07.088 --> 01:09.267
Respect, Gisborne, hm? I like it.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.775
Why don't you ever
kiss my ring, hm?

01:13.530 --> 01:15.656
So... you know what
you're going to do?

01:16.228 --> 01:18.791
Retrieve the Great Pact of Nottingham
and kill Robin Hood.

01:20.011 --> 01:22.169
Believe me, my lord, nothing
would give me greater pleasure.

01:23.294 --> 01:25.150
Robin Hood is as good as dead.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.864
PEOPLE SCREAM, HORSES WHINNY

02:18.010 --> 02:19.763
Robin! Sheriff's men.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.978
Wait! You don't want them to see
you with outlaws. I don't care!

02:25.539 --> 02:28.638
They're attacking the village. Let's
get them. Why are they doing this?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.349
"Why"?! Robin,
there isn't time for "why"!

02:31.761 --> 02:34.584
Let's go. Marian, we'll wait
and see how many... Come on!

02:34.911 --> 02:36.288
Marian!

02:38.287 --> 02:39.335
There's too many of them!

02:53.928 --> 02:56.945
Marian! Move!

03:04.726 --> 03:07.635
You, stay there! Don't move!

03:10.585 --> 03:11.629
SWORD IS UNSHEATHED

03:22.007 --> 03:23.083
Who's that?!

03:23.748 --> 03:24.884
Robin! The gallows!

03:36.532 --> 03:37.437
Friend, behind you!

03:57.190 --> 03:58.475
DJAQ: The Sheriff's men
are running away.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.802
Oh, my Lord! Oh, you've saved us!

04:02.146 --> 04:05.162
He's good. He's very good.

04:21.700 --> 04:25.932
Don't ever tie me up! Well, you didn't
listen to your orders. People were dying.

04:26.429 --> 04:27.959
Marian, you can't be seen with us.
Why not?!

04:28.950 --> 04:32.866
Robin, I AM with you. Because if
the Sheriff finds out, or Gisborne,

04:32.866 --> 04:35.646
then you can never go back to the
castle. I don't want to go back.

04:36.524 --> 04:39.868
Well, I'm glad. But you're not ready
to make that decision.

04:45.635 --> 04:46.950
Thank you, my friend.

04:47.985 --> 04:48.998
I owe you my life.

04:50.805 --> 04:51.527
Yes, you do.

04:52.343 --> 04:55.337
But I won't take it just yet. Carter.

04:56.651 --> 04:59.509
Robin Hood. Much.

04:59.931 --> 05:01.782
Nice, er... move.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.683
Do I know you? I...

05:05.871 --> 05:10.840
We've never met. These soldiers, why are
they attacking innocent people? He's wounded!

05:11.450 --> 05:12.450
It's nothing. Whoa!

05:13.784 --> 05:16.844
Djaq! Come on. Get up.

05:17.710 --> 05:18.936
Let's get him out of here. Come on.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.482
John! John! Will, get the quiver.

05:25.235 --> 05:27.858
I'm sure I've met him.
(Much, let it be!) I'm sure.

05:29.331 --> 05:30.154
I know that face.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.534
Did you fight in the Holy Land?
Yes. But we didn't meet.

05:38.373 --> 05:41.031
How can you be sure?
YOU, I'd have remembered.

05:43.331 --> 05:44.216
Why have you come back?

05:45.436 --> 05:46.334
Stabbed in the back.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.684
Did you get him? The one who did it?

05:51.248 --> 05:53.840
No... but I've been biding my time.

05:54.683 --> 05:57.223
Preparing.
You looked prepared today.

05:57.921 --> 05:59.367
You could have taken on
a whole army of them.

06:00.949 --> 06:03.278
Must be disappointed, though,
with, er... today's wound.

06:04.204 --> 06:06.731
I mean, if you're planning to go
back to the Holy Land and kill him.

06:08.103 --> 06:10.541
He's here. In England?

06:12.933 --> 06:15.214
It wasn't me, was it?
CARTER LAUGHS

06:16.774 --> 06:17.822
It worked, it worked!

06:18.715 --> 06:21.815
Hood saw the poor, innocent people
of Clun being attacked.

06:22.045 --> 06:24.742
And then dashed, rather dashingly,
in to save them.

06:25.366 --> 06:26.455
And we lost several guards.

06:27.264 --> 06:29.825
Yes, yes, yes.
It's very unfortunate. Um...

06:30.158 --> 06:32.421
Send their families
a basket of fruit. Small.

06:33.404 --> 06:37.579
But it worked! Carter left with
Hood. Hood could already be dead!

06:39.581 --> 06:42.111
Oh, and by the way,
Marian sent a message.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.410
What message? Oh, um...

06:47.704 --> 06:49.501
"I'm not coming back, get over it,

06:50.308 --> 06:52.901
"and for God's sake, change
your clothes once in a while!"

06:53.853 --> 06:56.780
Very funny(!)
She ran away.

06:57.901 --> 06:58.853
Guy, sit down.

07:04.712 --> 07:09.420
She ran away the minute
her dad died. Hm?

07:10.634 --> 07:12.866
Now, what does that tell us?
It tells me...

07:14.010 --> 07:19.197
that the crusty one was
the only thing keeping her here.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.125
No. There was something between us.

07:24.512 --> 07:29.292
No. She's not coming back, Guy.
Move on.

07:31.222 --> 07:32.615
GUY SIGHS
I'll tell you what...

07:34.247 --> 07:36.132
...I'll give you a kiss, hm?
That'll make you feel better.

07:37.535 --> 07:40.821
Oh, come along. In fact, if Hood's
dead, I'll give you TWO kisses!

07:41.301 --> 07:42.740
Come along. Kissy, kiss, kissy!

07:42.740 --> 07:43.990
Get off me!

07:48.519 --> 07:49.964
Grow up, Gisborne.

08:03.423 --> 08:07.025
Are you going to apologise to me?
You could have got me killed.

08:07.676 --> 08:10.232
I think you would have got
yourself killed without my help.

08:11.188 --> 08:16.016
Charging in like that. Robin, I've been fighting
these idiots for years, as the Nightwatchman.

08:17.261 --> 08:19.480
Remember? I know. On your own.

08:20.211 --> 08:24.005
This is a team, Marian. You went
crashing in and we all had to follow.

08:24.661 --> 08:27.015
And in battle, that's a cardinal
sin. We work together. MARION SCOFFS

08:28.303 --> 08:32.015
You mean they do as you tell them?
Yeah! Yeah, they do.

08:33.157 --> 08:36.390
Until you learn to do the same, you
can stay here at the camp. What?!

08:36.971 --> 08:40.174
I mean it, Marian.
You need to calm down.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.954
(Look, I don't need
to be mollycoddled, all right?)

08:46.330 --> 08:48.054
Good! Because you're
not going to get it here!

08:54.973 --> 08:55.977
ROBIN GROANS

09:09.053 --> 09:10.679
Have you been sent to baby-sit me?

09:14.767 --> 09:18.159
Why do you do everything he says?

09:19.756 --> 09:21.724
I thought you used to have
your own men, Little John.

09:22.363 --> 09:25.213
I did.
But there can only be one leader.

09:27.542 --> 09:32.964
This is not how I thought
it would be... living in the forest.

09:35.521 --> 09:39.086
I can't breathe... in here.

09:39.817 --> 09:41.285
It's worse than living
in the castle.

09:43.976 --> 09:44.773
Come here.

09:58.341 --> 09:59.921
It's not the here or there, is it?

10:01.440 --> 10:05.733
It's your father.
You've lost your father.

10:07.722 --> 10:11.504
And that's why
I want to get on with things.

10:12.393 --> 10:15.080
In time. In time.

10:36.813 --> 10:37.702
You should be resting.

10:38.784 --> 10:41.359
Things to do. What things?

10:57.868 --> 11:01.332
MUFFLED SCREAM
Stay here.

11:01.332 --> 11:03.297
Stay here. I will.

12:33.139 --> 12:33.921
Let me guess...

12:35.767 --> 12:38.030
the Sheriff sent you.
He wants his Pact back.

12:39.328 --> 12:40.423
No chance.

12:41.390 --> 12:42.986
I guaranteed it. Yeah?

12:44.014 --> 12:45.067
Well, you made a mistake.

12:45.976 --> 12:48.506
Tell me where you've hidden it.
I'll die first.

12:49.547 --> 12:53.344
No... your friends will die first,
one by one, until you tell me.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.764
See, that little look back...

12:59.735 --> 13:00.813
you just revealed your weakness.

13:02.878 --> 13:05.704
Never look back, friend.
Now I know I've won.

13:08.110 --> 13:11.767
So... who shall we start with?

13:12.409 --> 13:13.734
Your little sidekick
in the Holy Land?

13:15.680 --> 13:17.221
Or do you have a soft spot
for the girl?

13:18.719 --> 13:19.703
I thought so!

13:32.875 --> 13:34.282
Unbelievable!

13:35.015 --> 13:37.848
We took him in!
We pitied him because he was wounded

13:38.344 --> 13:40.943
I think that was his plan, Much.
I know.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.303
I knew. Just... outrageous!

13:48.833 --> 13:54.939
Marian...
He'll tell us more if he knows we're happy tu hurt him. Won't he?

13:55.213 --> 13:57.743
That's not how we're doing this.
Speak for yourself.

13:59.192 --> 14:03.473
Just go and cook something. What, because
I'm a woman? No, because I'm hungry!

14:09.186 --> 14:10.296
What are we going to do with him, Robin?

14:12.091 --> 14:13.197
We'll take him back to Nottingham.

14:14.844 --> 14:17.526
He's failed to find the Pact
and he's failed to kill me.

14:18.715 --> 14:21.210
So, What do you think the Sheriff would do to
a man who's failed him that badly?

14:21.919 --> 14:23.483
Hang him by the neck.
ROBIN LAUGHS

14:24.906 --> 14:25.744
If he's lucky.

14:27.822 --> 14:28.586
Come on.

14:34.943 --> 14:35.428
Wake up!

14:38.723 --> 14:40.289
What do you want? I want Marian.

14:42.054 --> 14:44.506
Do you know where she is?
What do you think?

14:46.447 --> 14:48.680
How am I supposed to find her, then?
She could be anywhere.

14:49.740 --> 14:50.591
Ask around.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.266
Earn your keep.

14:58.043 --> 14:59.779
Nottingham, then? No.

15:01.038 --> 15:01.629
Clun first.

15:03.787 --> 15:06.209
Not you, Marian.
You're staying here. Why?

15:07.097 --> 15:10.896
Because... I think you need
some time alone. Why?

15:11.946 --> 15:13.581
Because this isn't the Marian
I know and love.

15:14.325 --> 15:16.804
I'm sorry if you're disappointed,
but this is who I am now. Really?

15:17.864 --> 15:20.851
Well, I hope not. Come on, let's go.

15:22.236 --> 15:26.897
Why Clun? Because there's something
I want him to see. Come on!

15:43.678 --> 15:44.630
I'm sorry, Jane.

15:45.738 --> 15:49.303
We'll make sure you and your
family eat. You have my word.

15:50.151 --> 15:51.341
Thank you, Robin.

15:51.927 --> 15:54.051
Don't worry, Jane.
We'll set you straight. Here.

15:58.038 --> 15:58.996
Come on.

16:01.318 --> 16:03.006
Her husband died because of you.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.980
I only killed Sheriff's men.

16:07.505 --> 16:09.677
And they only killed villagers
to make you look good.

16:11.153 --> 16:12.804
Now, was that the Sheriff's idea
or was it yours?

16:14.130 --> 16:16.754
His. His. But you were happy
to go along with it.

16:17.903 --> 16:21.412
And you were happy to see her husband die,
if it meant that you'd get closer to me.

16:22.164 --> 16:25.566
What's your point, Locksley?
My point, assassin...

16:28.301 --> 16:31.799
...is there's widows here today, all trying
to comfort children who don't understand

16:32.004 --> 16:35.377
why their father didn't come home, and
why their mother won't stop crying.

16:36.506 --> 16:38.904
If you want me to feel sorry,
you're wasting your time. Am I?

16:40.308 --> 16:42.956
Because there's a reason why you
don't like to look back, Carter.

16:44.788 --> 16:46.644
Because you don't want
to see what it is you do.

16:48.145 --> 16:51.900
Because you don't like what you do.
And d'you know how I know that?

16:53.900 --> 16:55.277
It's because I used to be like you.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.916
I've killed
in the Holy Land as well.

16:59.788 --> 17:01.878
Boo-hoo(!) Boo-hoo...

17:23.089 --> 17:24.101
You could have had my eye out!

17:24.727 --> 17:27.138
You've got some nerve,
showing your face in the forest.

17:28.717 --> 17:32.991
I checked you were on your own first. I know what
the lads'll do to me if they get half a chance,

17:33.202 --> 17:36.898
but I figured I owe you this much. You're
here for me? Gisborne wants me to find you.

17:38.601 --> 17:41.306
I mean, obviously I didn't tell him
you'd probably be here. Obviously.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.995
No, but I'm going to need to tell him
something, right? So I was thinking,

17:45.678 --> 17:49.771
I could tell you've joined the Sisters of the Immaculate
Conception, Ripley convent.
Would he believe that? Yeah.

17:50.318 --> 17:54.879
Yeah. I was thinking, you could write a note.
Just say you want to be left alone.

17:55.495 --> 17:57.332
A bit of praying, grieving
or whatever.

17:58.103 --> 18:01.239
Why would YOU help ME?
Look, I'm not all bad.

18:02.417 --> 18:05.686
And any letters from the convent have
to be sealed by the mother superior.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.373
I can sort that. How?

18:09.423 --> 18:10.637
I'm good with nuns.

18:11.295 --> 18:12.967
Ave Maria, gratia plena

18:13.655 --> 18:16.343
Dominus tecum
Benedicta tu...

18:18.929 --> 18:21.848
Shhhh! You're all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

18:22.813 --> 18:24.911
I just want to borrow your ring.
MUFFLED SHOUTS

18:24.748 --> 18:26.228
Here we are. Come here.

18:27.994 --> 18:31.041
Lovely. Here you are.

18:31.901 --> 18:34.336
Buy yourself a new habit.
Say a little prayer for me.

18:39.729 --> 18:41.305
Right, Will, let's go.

18:44.571 --> 18:45.524
PUNCH LANDS
Ah!

18:45.282 --> 18:49.935
HE GROANS
Are you all right? Yeah.

18:50.310 --> 18:52.225
Everyone to me! Where did he go?

18:54.454 --> 18:56.300
Where is he?
John, Will, check by the road.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.408
You two, down there. Now!

19:00.682 --> 19:03.435
What about you? I'll stay here.

19:04.478 --> 19:07.436
Go on, go. You would need two!

20:05.643 --> 20:07.502
I accepted a contract to kill you.

20:08.753 --> 20:10.136
I will fulfil that contract.

20:12.393 --> 20:16.472
It's not just a contract...
is it, Carter?

20:19.096 --> 20:22.666
Much was right, wasn't he?
We did meet in the Holy Land.

20:23.565 --> 20:26.269
You never met me. You met my brother.

20:27.783 --> 20:29.957
What was his name?
You don't remember?!

20:30.661 --> 20:32.800
You should. You killed him.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.645
ROBIN LAUGHS
What was his name?

20:37.145 --> 20:39.079
Thomas. "Thomas"?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.518
And, yes, this is for him.

20:43.844 --> 20:44.841
I've waited for this moment.

20:45.902 --> 20:48.261
I've imagined it so many
different ways. Meeting you.

20:48.935 --> 20:50.662
Killing you. Good.

20:51.622 --> 20:53.247
Well, I hope
it lives up to expectation.

20:53.468 --> 20:55.013
It will. I've trained myself.

20:56.796 --> 20:58.984
I'm the best there is
and I exist, Locksley, to kill you.

21:04.628 --> 21:05.862
I didn't kill him, Carter.

21:08.262 --> 21:09.603
You ordered him into a village.

21:11.385 --> 21:12.853
He called for help,
but you did not come.

21:13.918 --> 21:17.214
You let him die. I remember him.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.276
He was a good fighter.
He was a war hero.

21:20.603 --> 21:24.339
Yeah. And he stopped listening.
He thought he was invincible.

21:24.643 --> 21:28.509
He led the charge into that village. We told
him it was dangerous. He wouldn't listen.

21:29.066 --> 21:31.671
No. We tried to save him.

21:32.563 --> 21:38.922
I tried. You're lying. I was there when they brought
back his body. The stretcher bearers told me everything.

21:41.951 --> 21:46.251
I told them to make up the story, so his
family would remember him as a war hero,

21:47.028 --> 21:48.733
not as a fool
who got himself killed.

21:50.968 --> 21:51.658
Rubbish!

21:54.589 --> 21:59.806
He wasn't the only one who died that day. Morgan
Foster died trying to save him. Matthew Kent.

22:00.409 --> 22:02.823
You think I believe this?
You're just frightened to die.

22:03.303 --> 22:07.007
You were a coward then, and you still
are. He cried when he died. Liar!

22:07.504 --> 22:11.346
He cried! And he said "Tell my family I didn't cry"

22:11.955 --> 22:16.064
"Tell them I wasn't crying. I was
laughing on the wrong side of my face!"

22:16.816 --> 22:21.347
That's what he used to say
- "Laughing on the wrong side of your face." How do you know that?

22:26.580 --> 22:29.564
I know, because I held him
in my arms when he died.

22:30.851 --> 22:33.188
No. He was a hero.

22:34.246 --> 22:36.681
You killed him. You're lying.

22:37.430 --> 22:38.757
If you really think I'm lying,

22:39.587 --> 22:43.556
you can kill me.
If you think it'll give you peace...

22:47.150 --> 22:48.321
...then kill me now.

23:08.594 --> 23:09.782
He WAS a hero.

23:12.063 --> 23:13.750
Just not on that day.

23:19.045 --> 23:20.288
What am I doing here?

23:23.108 --> 23:24.270
I don't know what I'm doing.

23:31.773 --> 23:32.439
Help me.

23:34.703 --> 23:35.426
My brother...

23:38.693 --> 23:39.836
...I loved him so much.

23:52.470 --> 23:53.301
It's all right.

23:54.709 --> 23:57.535
Hey... come on.

24:00.782 --> 24:01.710
It's all right.

24:04.658 --> 24:05.646
It's all right.

24:11.472 --> 24:12.437
Are you all right?

24:14.813 --> 24:17.379
CARTER SOBS
Why is he crying?

24:18.940 --> 24:20.033
He's not crying.

24:22.553 --> 24:24.688
He's laughing
on the wrong side of his face.

24:29.405 --> 24:30.812
Well, now you know
she's safe and well.

24:34.379 --> 24:36.640
And how do you know
that she's safe and well?

24:37.392 --> 24:40.469
She said. Did she?

24:43.269 --> 24:44.539
I thought they took
a vow of silence.

24:45.616 --> 24:46.668
No, I mean, the, um...

24:47.236 --> 24:50.585
the mother superior said,
when she gave me the letter. No.

24:53.144 --> 24:56.249
No. This is not right.

24:56.457 --> 24:57.207
What do you mean?

24:59.126 --> 25:03.641
Marian cannot take holy orders.
She has a life to lead.

25:05.896 --> 25:08.250
Saddle my horse.
Oh, I don't really do saddling.

25:09.361 --> 25:10.850
Do as you're told! Sure.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.289
Where are we going, then?
Ripley convent. Yeah?

25:15.425 --> 25:17.397
Hang on! Doesn't she want
to be on her own, grieving and...?

25:18.861 --> 25:20.713
Get my horse!
All right! All right.

25:23.437 --> 25:24.628
Thomas was my hero.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.704
Whatever he did, I had to do, too.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.241
And when he joined
the Knights Templar,

25:31.457 --> 25:32.425
I knew I had to follow.

25:33.969 --> 25:36.720
I had only just joined when...
when he died.

25:37.936 --> 25:39.878
Thomas... You look like him.

25:40.801 --> 25:42.049
That's why I recognised you.

25:43.149 --> 25:44.603
I was determined to carry on for him.

25:45.459 --> 25:48.189
To be as good as him.
To get to the very top.

25:49.356 --> 25:52.073
I joined the King's private Guard
Like us!

25:52.800 --> 25:54.128
And that's where I heard about you.

25:55.111 --> 25:58.684
Robin this, Robin that...
How great you were.

26:00.097 --> 26:02.517
And it made my blood boil.

26:03.941 --> 26:06.755
And every time I killed,
I imagined I was killing you -

26:07.734 --> 26:11.075
the man who took my brother
away from me. And when I returned...

26:11.840 --> 26:17.013
I came straight to Nottingham, where the
Sheriff has a contract on your head. £500.

26:17.764 --> 26:20.610
£500?! So I figured...

26:21.530 --> 26:25.595
with his plan to lure you to the
village, I'd get to you quicker.

26:26.700 --> 26:30.278
So all this death
was for personal revenge?!

26:35.223 --> 26:37.513
When did you last see the King? Why?

26:38.365 --> 26:40.989
Well, because...
we sent him a message -

26:42.402 --> 26:43.859
a very important message.

26:45.046 --> 26:48.484
The messenger was a man called Roger
of Stoke. Do you know him? I know Roger.

26:49.264 --> 26:52.548
No. He was expected, but did not return.
MUCH GASPS

26:53.627 --> 26:54.701
Great(!)

26:56.550 --> 27:00.268
So the King knows nothing about Shah
Mat? Shah-what? That doesn't concern you.

27:02.952 --> 27:06.421
What can I do? What can you do...?

27:09.489 --> 27:11.254
You can do what you set out to do.

27:12.031 --> 27:15.046
Go back to Nottingham,
give the Sheriff back his Pact...

27:15.878 --> 27:18.718
and one dead outlaw.

27:21.359 --> 27:22.686
MUCH: I can't believe
we're trusting him.

27:23.999 --> 27:27.656
He just tried to kill us. Of all of us,
you and I know what war can do to a man.

27:28.903 --> 27:31.403
I've been to war, but I
didn't come back a mad killer.

27:31.734 --> 27:35.904
Well, the demons work in different
ways, don't they? MUCH SIGHS

27:36.403 --> 27:41.173
But they're the same demons. I've got my demons
and you've never held me like you held him.

27:41.623 --> 27:43.238
Much! You haven't.

27:44.607 --> 27:48.030
You've never listened to MY story.
That's because I was there with you.

27:49.164 --> 27:52.168
It's my story, too. Yeah, I know.

27:53.727 --> 27:55.368
It's just
we've never talked about it.

27:56.678 --> 27:58.741
You know, we never talk.
Well, all right,

28:00.069 --> 28:04.837
let's talk. No. Not if you're doing
it to humour me. No. Come on, Much!

28:05.725 --> 28:08.430
Whatever I say you never listen to me, anyway.
Well, you know that's not true.

28:09.899 --> 28:12.175
I told you I recognised Carter
from the Crusades.

28:12.851 --> 28:14.629
ROBIN SIGHS
But you didn't believe me.

28:15.415 --> 28:18.627
You'd listen to Marian...
spend time with her.

28:18.627 --> 28:20.790
Much... stop.

28:23.414 --> 28:24.290
All right?

28:29.631 --> 28:30.778
Old friend...

28:32.367 --> 28:36.260
you have a special place
in my heart. Do I?

28:39.271 --> 28:40.903
Well, do I really have to say it?

28:43.302 --> 28:45.243
No. Of course not.

28:53.037 --> 28:54.680
Just once in a while,
it would be nice.

28:58.835 --> 29:02.131
What's he doing here?
Don't worry. It's a long story.

29:04.296 --> 29:05.894
Allan was here. Allan?!

29:06.501 --> 29:08.311
Yeah. Gisborne sent him to find me.

29:09.047 --> 29:11.944
I'll kill him! No, he was trying
to help. LITTLE JOHN SCOFFS

29:12.218 --> 29:15.816
He sent Gisborne a letter
saying I'm at Ripley convent.

29:16.984 --> 29:18.584
The medicine's ready
whenever you want.

29:20.905 --> 29:22.304
This could be dangerous, Robin.

29:23.736 --> 29:27.343
What is it you say, John?
"Today's a good day to die!"

29:28.281 --> 29:31.533
What? We're going to Nottingham
to collect Carter's fee.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.523
We're going to give it
to the people of Clun.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.594
"We"? I take it that includes me?

29:38.192 --> 29:41.781
I'm sorry, Marian. Either I'm
part of your gang or I'm not.

29:43.050 --> 29:46.459
Marian, for today,
please just stay here.

29:47.142 --> 29:48.302
Very well.

29:50.269 --> 29:52.160
Excuse me? I said, "very well".

29:53.239 --> 29:56.103
I bow to your authority. Thank you.

29:59.491 --> 30:02.396
I'm ready. Do we really need him?

30:03.172 --> 30:06.961
Well, the Sheriff's not going to give the money
to anybody else now, is he? And if he betrays us?

30:07.578 --> 30:10.411
Then on my head be it.
If he does, blame me.

30:10.922 --> 30:13.738
Good. I will... when we're dead.

30:13.954 --> 30:18.165
Good. And that's a rule
I'd like you to stick to -

30:18.785 --> 30:21.986
don't kill anybody unless
you have to. Spoilsport!

30:23.187 --> 30:26.410
Djaq... do your worst.

30:26.739 --> 30:30.346
Today is a good day.
I hate sayings.

30:36.063 --> 30:38.909
Creatorem caeli et terrae

30:42.699 --> 30:45.211
Et in lesum Christum

30:49.352 --> 30:51.842
Filium eius unicum

30:56.212 --> 30:58.386
Dominum nostrum

31:01.693 --> 31:04.604
Passus sub Pontio Pilato

31:08.787 --> 31:11.197
Crucifixus...
(What are you doing here?)

31:11.729 --> 31:13.478
(You should be back at camp.)
I lied.

31:14.594 --> 31:17.354
What are you going to do about it?
Nothing.

32:17.585 --> 32:18.338
What's this?

32:19.071 --> 32:21.178
Robin Hood. As promised.

32:22.867 --> 32:25.368
Dead? Dead.

32:27.868 --> 32:29.244
Really?

32:32.745 --> 32:34.762
Did you check him? Yes, Sir Guy.

32:36.827 --> 32:38.351
Well, let's make doubly sure,
shall we?

32:42.244 --> 32:43.554
Show me his neck.

32:54.628 --> 32:56.973
Guy! Marian?!

33:01.163 --> 33:02.252
What's happening here?

33:03.212 --> 33:05.484
Robin Hood. He's dead.

33:06.461 --> 33:07.516
Congratulations.

33:09.094 --> 33:10.472
I need to speak with you.

33:12.881 --> 33:14.447
In private, please.

33:18.222 --> 33:19.033
Carry on.

33:26.955 --> 33:29.533
Dei Patris omnipotentis

33:31.249 --> 33:34.068
Sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam...

33:34.822 --> 33:36.870
Yes, yes, that's
quite enough of the gobbledegook.

33:37.077 --> 33:38.216
Anywhere on the table will be fine.

33:52.465 --> 33:53.123
Exeunt.

33:55.015 --> 33:55.870
It means, "get out".

33:57.888 --> 33:59.607
They're with me. Not any more.

34:01.361 --> 34:03.607
Wait for me outside.
I will pay you then.

34:16.541 --> 34:19.199
We have... bad days.

34:20.949 --> 34:21.853
We have good days.

34:25.402 --> 34:30.637
And... when we have Robin Hood,

34:31.150 --> 34:34.793
laid out dead on our table,
we have the best days of our lives!

34:37.150 --> 34:39.058
The, um...
The Great Pact of Nottingham?

34:42.246 --> 34:44.933
Do you know what
I'm going to do with him now?

34:45.716 --> 34:48.635
That's not my concern, my lord.
My work here is done.

34:50.001 --> 34:54.362
Yes. Is that a subtle hint
that you'd like to be paid?

34:54.839 --> 34:56.842
I believe
I've fulfilled my contract. Oh...

34:57.814 --> 34:59.254
Yes, I believe you have.

35:01.028 --> 35:04.110
We shouldn't have left him. We didn't have
a choice. What if Carter isn't one of us?

35:04.875 --> 35:06.746
What if he tells the Sheriff?
Then Robin's dead.

35:12.261 --> 35:13.439
I received your letter.

35:14.310 --> 35:19.046
I was about to come and visit you. I asked to be
left alone, and still you were coming to see me?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.404
You knew I would. Yes.

35:24.349 --> 35:25.367
And that's why I came.

35:27.039 --> 35:30.349
To ask you to please leave me be.

35:32.566 --> 35:33.431
Marian...

35:35.771 --> 35:37.927
Do you seriously
expect me to believe

35:39.003 --> 35:41.121
that you have given yourself to God?

35:42.349 --> 35:46.680
Trust me, I haven't given
myself to anybody. Not yet.

35:47.816 --> 35:49.927
Good, because until you do,

35:51.208 --> 35:53.583
I will always believe that
there is a chance for you and me.

35:54.863 --> 35:58.809
I need to think. Stop thinking.
Come home to me!

35:59.849 --> 36:01.526
You burned my home to the ground!

36:03.139 --> 36:03.992
Marian...

36:06.771 --> 36:08.084
...if I could take that back,

36:09.318 --> 36:14.076
if I could show you the side to me that wants
to build a home, not burn it down. I've seen it.

36:14.508 --> 36:18.191
Then why do you reject it?
My father is dead.

36:20.319 --> 36:23.653
I need time... to grieve.

36:25.572 --> 36:27.015
What better way to grieve

36:28.014 --> 36:30.229
than to create new life? Marian!

36:31.291 --> 36:33.477
I thought that I might
never see you again.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.353
I thought I might never...

36:38.376 --> 36:39.079
What?

36:42.689 --> 36:43.654
...kiss you.

36:48.389 --> 36:51.158
DOOR OPENS
Ooh, sorry.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.870
The Sheriff wants you. He's gonna put
Robin's head on a spike.

37:01.538 --> 37:05.526
We must continue
this conversation soon. Guy!

37:13.774 --> 37:16.950
D'you know, I might have more work for you. Are you
staying in England? I may return to the Holy Land.

37:19.028 --> 37:22.476
Not to help King Richard?
I've had enough of fighting Saracens.

37:23.263 --> 37:25.213
I would, however,
like to learn more of their tricks.

37:26.337 --> 37:28.293
They are way ahead of us
with potions and remedies.

37:30.718 --> 37:33.702
They make a concoction to reduce
the breathing of a man to nothing.

37:35.329 --> 37:38.055
He seems to be dead, but is not.
Fascinating.

37:38.762 --> 37:43.212
A clue. And when the same man drinks
the opposing concoction,

37:44.390 --> 37:47.496
he comes back to life -
just like that.

37:49.229 --> 37:51.978
Really? Just like what?
Just like this!

37:57.262 --> 37:58.080
Alive?!

37:59.650 --> 37:59.869
Oh!

38:04.183 --> 38:08.510
Oh, really! I'll take that money.
I'm not paying you now -

38:09.157 --> 38:11.872
now that the stiff has
stepped off the stretcher!

38:14.183 --> 38:15.822
Kneel. Make me.

38:16.638 --> 38:19.249
Oh! With pleasure.

38:25.917 --> 38:27.992
What's she doing here?
She saved your life.

38:31.045 --> 38:33.997
Guy... I have to go.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.998
Go? You can't go.

38:37.293 --> 38:42.280
I can. And I must. Look, this was a
mistake. Marian, this wasn't a mistake.

38:42.542 --> 38:45.446
This was the most perfect thing that
has ever happened. I am grieving, Guy.

38:46.733 --> 38:48.258
I misled you. I'm sorry.

38:49.655 --> 38:50.945
I'm sorry.

38:51.510 --> 38:52.586
You're misleading yourself.

38:53.852 --> 38:57.309
I know. I've done it.
I told myself I didn't need you,

38:58.793 --> 39:03.194
that other things would satisfy me -
politics, power.

39:04.085 --> 39:06.854
Yet here we are. I have to get back.

39:07.604 --> 39:09.381
Before they realise I'm missing.

39:09.758 --> 39:13.837
Back to the convent? Yes. Marian, no.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.116
I forbid you to go.

39:23.382 --> 39:24.408
(See you back at the camp.)

39:31.695 --> 39:35.694
BELLS TOLL Alarm! They're in the
castle! Looks like they're missing us.

39:36.770 --> 39:39.050
Are you ready? Are you sure
you don't want to kill anyone?

39:39.894 --> 39:44.568
We're much more likely to get killed ourselves.
Ah, come on. We're much too good for that!

39:44.990 --> 39:46.992
All right. Let's find out.

39:50.368 --> 39:51.356
Search everywhere!

40:07.329 --> 40:08.621
Carter! Quick!

40:15.562 --> 40:16.532
Quick!

40:51.266 --> 40:52.651
Robin! Here! Robin!

41:01.713 --> 41:04.932
Do you do this often?
It seems to, yeah!

41:05.265 --> 41:06.651
It really would be simpler
to kill them.

41:07.744 --> 41:10.465
I know. But where
would be the fun in that, eh?

41:15.110 --> 41:17.946
I'd better be off.
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

41:18.436 --> 41:21.854
I do. But I'm going back to the Holy
Land. I want to visit my brother's grave.

41:22.876 --> 41:25.002
Say goodbye properly.
Tell him I'm sorry.

41:26.171 --> 41:27.321
I thought I was honouring his memory.

41:29.307 --> 41:32.403
And I thought I could do something
useful. Warn King Richard for you.

41:35.026 --> 41:35.995
Thank you.

41:40.653 --> 41:43.836
MARIAN SIGHS
Well, you disobeyed me.

41:44.464 --> 41:45.539
I saved your life!

41:46.588 --> 41:49.789
And you kissed Gisborne.
And you tied me up.

41:50.450 --> 41:52.432
And you could have got
us all killed. I'm sorry.

41:54.403 --> 41:55.914
I'm not used to taking orders.

41:57.526 --> 41:58.518
But I can learn.

42:00.186 --> 42:02.187
I'd like to be part of your gang.

42:03.668 --> 42:05.433
And I'm not used to you being
in the forest, but...

42:06.918 --> 42:10.123
I'll learn. Truce?

42:10.947 --> 42:12.948
Yeah, truce.

42:15.871 --> 42:16.826
Safe journey, my friend.

42:56.016 --> 42:57.139
There's a messenger here.

42:57.168 --> 42:59.102
From Lady Marian? No, from the King.

43:02.622 --> 43:06.398
He wants me to send a note back with Lardner.
Beware of the power of Lardner's ring.

43:07.011 --> 43:10.576
What is Lardner's ring?
Robin, the Sheriff's coming!

43:10.871 --> 43:13.694
You're surrounded, Hood!
Maybe you could use me as a hostage?

43:14.356 --> 43:18.327
Gisborne! If I die, Marian dies.
Marian!

43:18.472 --> 43:19.831
Will you marry me? What?!

43:20.305 --> 43:26.642
