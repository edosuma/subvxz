WEBVTT

00:32.198 --> 00:33.575
We had one simple rule, Allie.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.704
Not to be seen.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.875
You need to come with me.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.503
Where's Charlie?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.880
Charlie's okay,
but you have to come with me right now.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.550
-Where?
-To speak to the landlord.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.738
-You must be Allie.
-Yeah.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.740
Hey, you wanna come in?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.077
-Sure.
-Apologies for the noise.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.370
They're a local band.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.627
Guillermo and I have known each other
since we were… What?

04:55.587 --> 04:56.922
Four years old?

04:57.840 --> 05:00.259
You were four. I was your boss.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.137
We live in land owned
by Guillermo's family.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.681
I'm the landlord.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.434
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I got that.

05:09.518 --> 05:13.230
I protect Isela.
Isela protects her people.

05:13.313 --> 05:17.818
But if the cartels were to find that
I'm providing asylum for their enemies,

05:17.901 --> 05:19.987
that could be…

05:20.070 --> 05:22.447
Well, it would be consequential for me.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.994
And for the entire town.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.080
Your boy could have led
those poachers directly to Casa Roja.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.749
Do you have any idea
of the jeopardy you put me in?

05:34.168 --> 05:35.169
All of us.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.839
Well, it's not his fault.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.008
No, of course not. He's a boy.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.635
You're supposed to teach him
right and wrong.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.762
The guys who saw him didn't follow him.

05:45.846 --> 05:50.100
No, because I know them,
and they came to me.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.727
We're all very lucky.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.022
Yeah. No, I'm feeling pretty lucky.

05:57.482 --> 06:01.236
Entonces, what do I do?

06:02.196 --> 06:03.780
Help me out here.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.742
You broke the rules. Put me in jeopardy.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.619
Do I expel you from Casa Roja?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.413
Send you off to cultivate the ground
you were taken from?

06:12.122 --> 06:15.375
Do I hurt you?
Put a bullet through your knee?

06:17.794 --> 06:21.256
Because seriously, I hate that bullshit.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.509
I don't like to hurt people.

06:23.592 --> 06:28.180
So if you want to remain on my land,
prove you're worthy.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.892
Do something for me. Make it right.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.520
Let me explain the situation
to you, Allie.

06:34.603 --> 06:39.107
They're tearing down our whole jungle
to build some tourist resort.

06:39.191 --> 06:43.153
Hotels, a marina,
a fucking conference center.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.572
Casa Roja will become a parking lot,

06:45.656 --> 06:48.283
and everyone who lives there,
who has nothing,

06:48.367 --> 06:50.077
will have no home to go to.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.872
Including you and your family.

06:53.956 --> 06:58.585
So go off on that boat of yours
that you sank and sail away.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.796
-None of us want this, Allie.
-No.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.798
So help us out.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.385
How am I supposed to do that?

07:06.468 --> 07:10.681
I need two men I can trust,
men from outside my world.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.269
Finding someone from outside my orbit
that I can trust,

07:15.352 --> 07:17.938
well, that's not gonna happen.

07:18.772 --> 07:23.485
Someone from outside my orbit
that I can control is more likely.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.321
Two men?

07:32.661 --> 07:33.704
Come in.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.833
Hey, Allie.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.553
What a coincidence.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.763
I know you and Mr. Lee
have a little history,

07:51.847 --> 07:54.850
but he works for me now, so it's all good.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.191
Look, you want my help
with something, just ask.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.693
It's a difficult time for everyone, Allie.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.406
What Charlie did,
it spooked the hell out of Guillermo.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.200
Sure. Yeah. No. He's your friend.

08:11.783 --> 08:15.120
Oh, yeah. You're right. He is my friend.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.206
And one I need much more than I need you.

08:17.289 --> 08:20.501
So, clean the slate. Help us out.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.295
Save the only home you've got.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.636
Shall we?

09:05.879 --> 09:06.880
Oye, Allie.

09:08.924 --> 09:09.925
Final thought.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.802
This is important.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.513
As we discussed,
none of this can be traced back to me.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.474
If you're caught and questioned,

09:17.558 --> 09:21.436
believe me, you will tell those guys
exactly what they want to know.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.606
And then they will chop
you up into tiny little pieces.

09:27.860 --> 09:31.780
I can't afford to let that happen.
Neither can Isela.

09:31.864 --> 09:35.284
And I'm sorry to say so,
but neither can your family.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.203
So don't get caught.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.598
You ready, honey bunch?

10:06.148 --> 10:07.983
You mind fastening your fucking seat belt?

10:09.193 --> 10:10.319
That's what that was.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.322
Thank you kindly.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.033
All right.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.993
Ready to go save some trees?

10:29.421 --> 10:30.339
You're worried.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.009
Not about this,

10:34.092 --> 10:36.637
but about everything else
we need him to do for us.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.224
The trick with a guy like Allie is…

10:42.226 --> 10:43.810
to remove all options.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.896
Impose limits.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.107
Don't worry.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.234
It's going to be fine.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.529
My guy is coming tomorrow
and will change everything.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.783
I wish I had a fifth of your optimism.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.995
Pessimism of the spirit.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.747
Optimism of the will.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.381
I'm okay. It was just a dream.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.718
Don't shut me out, okay?

14:45.928 --> 14:47.179
I'm here for you.

14:48.514 --> 14:49.723
Okay.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.600
Seriously. I'm fine.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.728
-Good morning.
-Hey.

14:56.939 --> 14:57.940
Have you seen Dad?

14:58.023 --> 15:01.068
Oh, God, I fell asleep
while he was still in the workshop.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.862
-He's probably still there.
-Reinventing the world.

15:05.531 --> 15:06.532
I'm gonna go see.

15:07.533 --> 15:10.035
There's nothing to worry about.
Wherever he is, he's fine.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.705
I know. I just wanna check. Make sure.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.084
Is something wrong?

15:17.876 --> 15:19.878
No, nothing.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.633
Come on. No one's in trouble here.
Do you know something that I don't?

15:24.716 --> 15:27.553
No, Mom, I don't know
what you're talking about. I was just--

15:28.178 --> 15:31.348
I just wanted to go wash the dishes,
then go look. That's all.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.183
Okay.

15:49.533 --> 15:50.534
Dad?

16:14.516 --> 16:16.018
Besitos. You wanna try?

16:18.353 --> 16:20.898
Anytime you want to get to the point,
that's fine by me.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.483
I don't see any reason to be rude.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.737
Is there a reason that I should be polite?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.405
No, it's just easier is all.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.782
And not for nothing.
It makes you feel better about yourself.

16:30.866 --> 16:34.912
Your son, he pulled the trigger
on my friend, and now he's dead.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.791
He was a good guy. Name of Isaias.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.251
God rest his soul.

16:44.046 --> 16:47.174
You pulled a gun on my daughter,
shot at her.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.469
You tried to kill us.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.071
Thank you.

17:13.825 --> 17:18.454
Pretty pricey.
Still, half of what it would be back home.

17:19.623 --> 17:23.585
Yeah?
Killing people not paying what it used to?

17:24.252 --> 17:25.587
Supply and demand.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.098
Hey. Excuse me.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.143
Excuse me. I wasn't thinking.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.437
Do you know where she is?

17:42.521 --> 17:43.689
-Non.
-Non?

17:43.772 --> 17:45.399
Is she with Allie?

17:46.149 --> 17:47.317
No idea.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.736
No sense of when she'll be back?

17:50.571 --> 17:54.199
I expect she'll be on the Magdalena
when it docks.

17:54.408 --> 17:55.617
Okay.

17:55.701 --> 17:57.327
If you see either of them before,

17:57.411 --> 17:59.580
could you tell Allie I'm looking for him?

18:00.539 --> 18:01.582
No worries.

18:02.624 --> 18:03.667
Please.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.310
What do you think's going on?

18:23.645 --> 18:24.688
I don't know.

18:25.856 --> 18:29.234
Yeah, but something is, right?
Dad wouldn't just, like, go somewhere.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.154
-Yeah, something's happening.
-You think he's okay?

18:33.488 --> 18:34.948
Can look after himself, right?

18:36.783 --> 18:37.868
Then we should go.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.872
Grab Charlie and leave right now.
Dad and Isela are both out of the way.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.874
Dina, just drop it.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.793
Okay? What the fuck do you think
we're leaving on?

18:46.877 --> 18:49.421
Or are we just bushwhacking
our way out of here? We're not prepared.

18:49.505 --> 18:51.215
Mom, no.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.926
Come on. You shift with the wind.
I push you. We're going.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.261
Then we're not going.
Then we're going. Then not.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.555
Where are you?

18:58.639 --> 19:01.099
I'm here. I'm trapped. We all are.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.896
Okay, we'll figure it out.
A little while longer here.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.398
Maybe it's not so bad.

19:12.778 --> 19:13.987
This is impossible.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.589
It's the Magdalena.

19:56.572 --> 19:59.992
Isela, I thought maybe Allie was with you.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.285
He was.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.414
He just had to stay behind
for a little bit.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.623
Stay behind where?

20:07.749 --> 20:10.627
I asked him to take
a couple solar panels downriver.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.021
All right, love?

20:29.897 --> 20:32.482
A woman has died
after an explosion at a laboratory

20:32.566 --> 20:34.526
in Bethesda late last night.

20:34.610 --> 20:38.739
The victim has been identified as
32-year-old lab assistant, Alison Caffrey.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.325
The nature of the explosion
is still being investigated.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.119
However, authorities are searching
for two persons of interest.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.954
A man and woman were seen…

20:46.038 --> 20:48.332
Turn it off.
I don't want the kids to hear.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.838
I never loved Richard.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.634
It was never about that.
I believed in what we were doing.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.388
Was he in love with you?

21:04.014 --> 21:05.098
It doesn't matter now.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.768
What do we do? Where do we go?

21:08.519 --> 21:09.645
There's Isela.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.899
A camp in the jungle?
I can't do that to the kids.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.192
Okay.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.821
You don't have to throw everything away.
Not for me.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.114
Throw what away?

21:28.163 --> 21:30.499
We go off the grid. We keep moving.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.211
-We could call my parents.
-No. That's what gets us caught.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.641
You okay?

21:53.856 --> 21:55.232
I need to have a word.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.654
You stay behind
and make yourselves useful.

22:04.533 --> 22:05.534
Come on.

22:32.227 --> 22:35.439
-Hey, who was that guy?
-I don't know. I've never seen him.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.523
Yeah, that was weird.

22:38.942 --> 22:39.943
Yeah.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.154
Hey, kid, give me a hand
with these crates.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.948
Go help. Go.

22:59.630 --> 23:00.714
What's he doing here?

23:01.590 --> 23:03.842
-I invited him.
-Oh, yeah? Invited to what?

23:03.926 --> 23:05.719
With all due respect,
that's none of your business.

23:05.802 --> 23:09.014
-With all due respect, my kids live here.
-What are you trying to say?

23:09.097 --> 23:11.141
Stay the fuck away from my kids,
you prick.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.809
Jesus Christ.

23:17.481 --> 23:19.107
Holy shit.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.238
They don't know, do they?

23:24.321 --> 23:26.990
-I'd prefer to keep it like that.
-You think I'm gonna tell them?

23:29.826 --> 23:33.580
I wouldn't do that,
not in a million years.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.166
-I love those kids.
-Don't.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.670
No. Listen, it's important.

23:40.963 --> 23:42.714
I wouldn't do anything to hurt them.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.342
Why would I?

23:46.927 --> 23:48.011
If this is about Allie then--

23:48.095 --> 23:49.805
It's got nothing to do with Allie.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.475
I'm not some Disney princess
to be won over

23:53.559 --> 23:55.853
by some fucking Prince Charming.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.980
Queen fucking Guinevere
for Christ's sakes.

23:58.063 --> 24:03.318
Jesus. Okay, clearly there's
some unresolved issues here.

24:03.986 --> 24:07.573
No, Isela. A woman died.

24:07.656 --> 24:09.366
We made a bomb, and a woman died.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.785
Yes, I know. And it was terrible.

24:13.954 --> 24:17.457
-You knew?
-Of course.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.668
Jesus fucking Christ. Allie?

24:19.751 --> 24:21.962
A long time ago
when he thought you would be living here.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.047
He had no right.

24:24.131 --> 24:25.674
He had no choice.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.676
No one's judging you, Margot.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.762
In our line of work,
we risk people getting hurt.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.264
We risk things going wrong.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.891
She didn't get hurt. She died.

24:34.933 --> 24:37.394
And you two had a part in it.

24:38.103 --> 24:40.272
And now you both are my guests.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.568
What the hell is he doing here?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.028
It's only gonna be for a while,

24:46.111 --> 24:49.907
so please, will you learn
to deal with this as adults?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.247
Dina? Dina!

24:57.998 --> 25:00.709
Dina, please.
Please just give me a chance, please.

25:00.792 --> 25:05.005
Sweetie… please. Honey, I'm so--

25:07.466 --> 25:11.595
You're a liar.
Why on earth would I listen to you?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.401
Thanks.

26:09.987 --> 26:11.488
You let him take the blame.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.661
How could you do that to us?

26:20.080 --> 26:22.791
-I wanted to tell you so many times.
-Bullshit.

26:24.168 --> 26:26.628
How many times did I bring it up,

26:26.712 --> 26:28.672
and you just couldn't quite
work up the nerve?

26:28.755 --> 26:32.551
It was a decision your father and I made,
and I was wrong.

26:34.344 --> 26:37.306
I regret it. I still regret it.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.686
The only thing you regret
is getting caught.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.361
What was her name anyways?

26:55.782 --> 26:58.702
Funny thing is
I've never actually said it out loud.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.042
It was Alison.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.547
Did you blame yourself?

27:10.631 --> 27:12.549
Of course I did. I still do.

27:13.717 --> 27:18.472
Then how did you manage
to just keep on living your life?

27:19.848 --> 27:23.560
Well, if it's any help, for a long time,
yes, I wanted to die.

27:23.644 --> 27:26.939
That it would be better for you guys
if I wasn't around to fuck things up.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.440
So, yeah, I did think about ending it.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.238
Do you still?

27:35.197 --> 27:36.532
Sometimes.

27:36.615 --> 27:37.783
Then why don't you?

27:39.743 --> 27:41.078
Because of you and Charlie.

27:42.204 --> 27:43.247
And Dad?

27:45.791 --> 27:47.125
I think. Maybe.

27:47.209 --> 27:50.295
If none of it had happened
and you didn't do what you did…

27:53.298 --> 27:54.925
would you have gone back to him?

27:58.303 --> 28:01.056
I don't know. Maybe.
We were in such a different place then.

28:02.599 --> 28:06.520
Yeah, he was normal.

28:07.813 --> 28:10.774
And he took the blame to protect you.

28:11.358 --> 28:15.571
Your dad and I made a deal
to make things work.

28:16.572 --> 28:18.866
That's what you do in a marriage.
Any marriage.

28:18.949 --> 28:22.661
Nobody ends up where they wanna be
or where they thought they'd be.

28:22.744 --> 28:27.249
And for the most part, it was good.
We were actually pretty happy, I think.

28:28.500 --> 28:32.254
You made a deal that we weren't a part of.

28:33.630 --> 28:37.259
You robbed us of ten years of our lives.

28:37.843 --> 28:39.428
I wish you had done it.

28:39.928 --> 28:43.265
I wish you had slit your wrists.
I wish you had turned yourself in.

28:44.641 --> 28:47.102
Let us live our lives and just be normal.

28:49.479 --> 28:52.941
Well, I didn't, and here we are.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.361
Why are we even talking?

29:21.136 --> 29:23.347
Hands off the jungle!

29:23.680 --> 29:25.682
Hands off the jungle!

29:26.058 --> 29:28.018
Hands off the jungle!

29:36.860 --> 29:38.654
Please clear the walkway.

29:38.737 --> 29:41.323
Make a path for conference guests.

29:49.248 --> 29:52.584
Good evening. Buenas noches.

29:52.668 --> 29:56.463
We'll have the 39-E's and the disclosures
available at the end of the presentation.

29:56.547 --> 29:58.590
But right up front, I wanna tell you

29:58.674 --> 30:02.636
that this is the most exciting
and visionary project we've launched.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.478
We have designed this project…

30:11.562 --> 30:14.398
-Your invitation, sir?
-…from the bottom up, to present positive,

30:14.481 --> 30:16.608
-front-facing optics in that regard.
-Thank you.

30:16.692 --> 30:21.572
Now, this project features over
two million square feet of office space,

30:21.655 --> 30:24.324
5,000 residential units, schools,

30:24.408 --> 30:27.911
two five-star hotels, luxury shopping…

30:28.495 --> 30:30.622
Audiovisual room's on the second floor.

30:31.999 --> 30:37.504
But the highlight, a five-acre
conservation of ancestral lands

30:37.588 --> 30:41.008
currently being threatened
by illegal deforestation.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.760
We call it simply…

30:46.638 --> 30:48.098
the Rainforest.

30:50.726 --> 30:55.647
Now, access to this curated
and faithfully recreated ecosystem

30:55.731 --> 30:57.608
-will be limited to guests and residents.
-Shit.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.401
Huh?

31:00.652 --> 31:01.987
It's the Bautistas.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.489
Who are they? Are they gonna be a problem?

31:05.282 --> 31:08.118
If they see us, yeah. So let's go.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.203
Yeah.

31:13.165 --> 31:14.416
Thank you so much.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.104
Hey, Charlie.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.525
How do you even know my name?

31:44.154 --> 31:47.908
So, how does this work?

31:49.868 --> 31:51.870
You fill these with water,
then you wash them,

31:51.954 --> 31:54.456
and the limestone on the ground it--

31:54.540 --> 31:57.584
it filters them
'cause there's a high salt content, so…

31:57.668 --> 32:01.588
Wow, impressive. Have you tested it?

32:03.215 --> 32:04.550
Just taste it.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.639
Charlie, honey, I'll see you at home.

32:11.515 --> 32:14.184
Okay. Like, right now?

32:14.268 --> 32:16.270
Yeah, right now. Please.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.204
So…

32:40.127 --> 32:41.128
So…

32:44.464 --> 32:46.717
-I tried telling you.
-I thought I'd never see you again.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.051
And I was fine with that.

32:50.095 --> 32:55.434
I waited that night. Where we agreed.

32:57.519 --> 32:58.979
But you left with Allie.

32:59.563 --> 33:01.523
You ran, Richard. You left me.

33:04.067 --> 33:05.068
I know.

33:06.111 --> 33:07.446
Why are you even here?

33:08.488 --> 33:11.867
Come on. Isn't it obvious?

33:15.329 --> 33:19.708
This kind of experiential exclusivity

33:20.375 --> 33:22.586
is highly marketable
to our target clientele.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.421
-Move.
-Hey.

33:24.505 --> 33:26.006
Against the wall.

33:26.089 --> 33:28.425
-What the fuck are you doing?
-What's it look like?

33:28.509 --> 33:29.593
Load that up, please.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.682
No fucking way. No.

33:35.766 --> 33:38.519
No witnesses. You step aside now.

33:38.602 --> 33:40.854
He's a fucking kid. He didn't do anything.

33:40.938 --> 33:42.231
Kid's here, and that's enough.

33:42.314 --> 33:43.315
No, sir. Please.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.735
-What's your name?
-Luis.

33:46.818 --> 33:48.737
Luis, don't get out of that fucking chair.

33:49.780 --> 33:52.282
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Now step aside.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.200
No.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.119
-Sir, please.
-Shut up!

33:56.620 --> 33:57.996
I won't say a word.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.089
Allie, don't think I won't do this.

34:11.176 --> 34:12.177
You won't.

34:13.971 --> 34:16.639
Your new boss needs me
for something, right?

34:17.766 --> 34:20.936
Or I got that vibe, didn't you?
'Cause I definitely got that vibe.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.856
You want to do it, go ahead.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.666
You're very lucky, Luis.

34:43.667 --> 34:48.045
That man with a good heart
has saved your life.

34:50.007 --> 34:51.007
Relax.

35:15.157 --> 35:20.954
So, on behalf of all of the splendid
and talented people

35:21.038 --> 35:25.334
who helped me turn an idea
on the back of a napkin into this,

35:25.417 --> 35:28.837
I'd like to leave you
with some ancient Native American wisdom

35:28.921 --> 35:30.714
that has informed my life.

35:31.882 --> 35:33.300
Treat the Earth well.

35:33.967 --> 35:38.430
It was not given to you by your parents.
It was loaned to you by your children.

35:40.057 --> 35:43.018
The clock's ticking
as soon as you press play. You got that?

35:51.151 --> 35:52.152
Okay, it's done.

35:52.236 --> 35:54.112
Let's get out of here.

36:10.254 --> 36:11.255
Thank you.

36:12.130 --> 36:14.049
Thank you.

36:16.593 --> 36:18.220
This will be our final warning.

36:18.887 --> 36:21.849
No longer will we allow you to ignore us.

36:21.932 --> 36:24.893
No longer will we allow you
to rape and pillage the Earth.

36:24.977 --> 36:27.020
That's my family, my kid!

36:28.814 --> 36:30.440
She's my wife!

36:30.524 --> 36:33.151
No longer will we stand by
as you line your pockets,

36:33.235 --> 36:35.153
stealing from the children of tomorrow.

36:35.237 --> 36:37.948
This will be our final warning.

36:40.325 --> 36:43.245
I am so sorry. I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this right now.

36:43.328 --> 36:44.496
Excuse me. One moment, please.

36:44.580 --> 36:48.500
Your actions have pushed us
further into environmental collapse.

36:48.584 --> 36:53.297
The effects of which will be suffered
not by you, but by the future generations.

36:54.631 --> 36:57.718
We are their representatives
here to enact their vengeance.

36:57.801 --> 36:59.595
-This will be our final warning.
-Shut this shit down!

36:59.678 --> 37:01.138
Get the fuck outta here,
and shut this down.

37:05.976 --> 37:09.271
You think you are hidden
from the consequences of your actions,

37:09.354 --> 37:12.065
-but you are not.
-Get it off the fucking screen.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.818
-You think your families…
-I'm so sorry.

37:15.777 --> 37:18.447
-Please excuse me. Please stay seated.
-We have tried

37:18.530 --> 37:21.617
to reason with you.
And we have tried to warn you.

37:23.452 --> 37:25.704
But if violence is the only language
you know,

37:25.787 --> 37:29.166
then violence is a language we will speak.

37:29.249 --> 37:31.835
This will be our final warning.

37:32.377 --> 37:34.713
-If you proceed…
-Lock this fucking place down, okay?

37:34.796 --> 37:37.216
Nobody leaves.
You understand me? Nobody leaves.

37:37.299 --> 37:38.300
All call signs.

37:38.383 --> 37:41.637
Please. Full lockdown, now. Full lockdown.

37:42.513 --> 37:45.098
We are entering a temporary lockdown.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.100
Please secure all exits.

37:47.976 --> 37:49.520
I recognize that voice.

37:50.604 --> 37:51.772
I don't give a shit.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.650
They're gonna be locking
this place down soon. So we gotta go.

38:01.490 --> 38:04.326
Excuse me, gentlemen,
this area is closed. So, please go back.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.036
Thank you.

38:08.914 --> 38:11.667
You remember what Guillermo said
about getting caught, right?

38:19.591 --> 38:21.260
I think they got us pinched.
