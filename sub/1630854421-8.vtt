00:07.132 --> 00:08.675
- The Torah says
you must welcome,

00:08.717 --> 00:10.468
feed, love, teach,

00:10.510 --> 00:13.555
and worship with the stranger.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.432
- Mr. Wentworth.
- I live here.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.851
- Here, there, and everywhere.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.061
- When I saw his face
through that window,

00:20.103 --> 00:22.731
I saw the rage, like he was
going to kill Holt.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.024
- Can I trust him?

00:24.065 --> 00:26.359
Because I will not cover up
for anybody, ever.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.487
I never have, and I never will.
Are we clear?

00:29.529 --> 00:31.448
- Holt's been charged
with terrorist threats

00:31.489 --> 00:34.159
and attempted murder
for the attack on Anna Harvey.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.162
We still have no idea what
happened to Elisabeth Serra.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.913
It's not the case
we started with,

00:38.955 --> 00:40.331
but it's the one we have left.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.666
Find out what happened to her.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.251
- Do you mind if
we make this quick?

00:43.293 --> 00:45.712
There's a 5K bonus there
if I get done by Friday.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.548
- Who handled your family's
finances, Mr. Serra?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.592
You or Elisabeth?
- She did.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.427
I mean, she made
a lot of money first,

00:52.469 --> 00:54.137
till it all went to shit.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.847
- Are you going to
bring back my first dad--

00:55.889 --> 00:57.390
- Danny!

00:57.432 --> 00:58.933
- I don't know if I'm OK
leaving him with the boys.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.477
- We don't have enough to get

01:00.518 --> 01:02.562
Children's Services
involved yet.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.565
- If Elisabeth is dead,
she didn't do it herself.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.900
Paul killed her.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.777
- I think that Hanney
begged her to go with him,

01:08.818 --> 01:10.904
and she thought about it,
and then she said no.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.822
He loses his shit,
and then he killed her,

01:12.864 --> 01:14.991
and he dumped her body
in the ocean.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.744
Have you ever looked
into your father's case?

01:17.786 --> 01:18.870
- No.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.413
I don't think
she's out in the ocean.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.165
- Then where is she?

01:22.207 --> 01:25.168
[dramatic music]

01:25.210 --> 01:32.300
* *

02:14.300 --> 02:17.220
[dramatic music]

02:17.262 --> 02:19.889

02:19.931 --> 02:22.851
- [muffled shouting]

02:34.362 --> 02:41.494

02:44.372 --> 02:46.916
[roller coaster rattling]

03:06.269 --> 03:08.605
[excited screaming]

03:17.072 --> 03:20.033
[foreboding music]

03:20.075 --> 03:26.998
* *

03:30.251 --> 03:33.380
[gasps]

03:42.305 --> 03:45.308
[panting]

03:45.350 --> 03:52.440

04:06.830 --> 04:09.791
- [sighs]

04:15.630 --> 04:18.758
[keyboard clacking]

04:24.639 --> 04:27.767
[soft suspenseful music]

04:27.809 --> 04:34.858

04:35.483 --> 04:38.319
[dog barking in the distance]

04:45.744 --> 04:48.830
[distant siren wailing]

05:09.309 --> 05:10.852
[knocking on door]

05:12.520 --> 05:14.189
- Oh, hey.
Great, yeah. Come on in.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.899
I guess you got
my message, huh?

05:15.940 --> 05:17.233
Great news, right?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.318
The boys are really excited.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.819
- Uh, Mr. Serra,

05:19.861 --> 05:22.364
we're here to check on the
status of your missing wife.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.115
We never got a message
from you.

05:24.157 --> 05:28.036
- That's weird.
I called the--the precinct.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.788
- Good news never seems
to reach us.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.706
Only bad news.
So please, share.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.291
- Uh, it's Elisabeth.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.584
She, uh--she's fine.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.044
She's alive.
She's safe.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.213
She wants to get back together
with me and the boys.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.798
Honestly, I still
can't believe it.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.758
It's a fucking miracle.
- Sounds like it.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.385
- So when did this all happen?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.679
- About an hour ago,
she called.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.971
We were on our way
out the door.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.682
We almost missed her.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.934
- Did she tell you exactly
where she was calling from?

05:50.975 --> 05:53.853
- Yeah, a hotel
outside Mexico City.

05:53.895 --> 05:57.023
Actually, I wrote down
the name and the address

05:57.065 --> 05:59.150
for you in case
you want to check it out.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.486
She lost her cell phone,
had to get a temp.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.030
But she sounds good,
sounds centered.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.658
- So it ends up she wasn't
staying with her parents.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.284
No wonder we couldn't
find her there.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.619
- No, no, she said--

06:09.661 --> 06:11.538
she said she had to
leave the country

06:11.579 --> 06:13.498
'cause that guy Hanney
at the club

06:13.540 --> 06:15.208
was harassing her, all right?

06:15.250 --> 06:17.752
She couldn't tell us where
she was going to protect us.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.546
- Why didn't
she tell you before?

06:19.587 --> 06:21.047
- She was afraid
I'd go after him.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.257
- Oh.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.134
- Now she thinks
enough time has passed that

06:24.175 --> 06:27.053
we should just come down
and meet her in Mexico, so...

06:27.095 --> 06:28.930
- How wonderful
for you and Elisabeth.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.348
- Yeah.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.434
- I hope we can meet her
someday when you're all back.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.060
- Uh, yeah, I'll be sure
to give you a call.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.895
I think we're only going to be
down there about a week, so...

06:35.937 --> 06:37.814
- So when exactly
are you leaving?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.441
- We're catching
a flight tonight.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.568
- Oh.
- Yeah, this is--

06:41.609 --> 06:44.904
it's good news, detectives.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.700
- Can you tell us about
the crypto investment?

06:48.742 --> 06:52.328
- Uh, yeah.
I mean, I already did.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.457
- Tell us again, one more time.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.916
- OK, um,

06:56.958 --> 06:59.127
Elisabeth got the tip.
She bought the crypto.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.795
I transferred it
to the holding company,

07:00.837 --> 07:02.005
and then she lost everything.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.089
- Well, wait, before,
you said that

07:03.131 --> 07:04.632
Elisabeth transferred
the crypto.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.217
- Right, that's what
I just said to you.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.677
What--what is your problem?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.346
- There's no need to
be angry, Mr. Serra.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.638
- Look, from the beginning,

07:10.680 --> 07:12.098
I have done nothing
but tell you the truth.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.517
All you have done
is accuse me, all right?

07:14.559 --> 07:16.102
So tonight,
I am going to see my wife.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.729
I am taking my children
to see their mother.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.439
- You're not getting on
any flight, Mr. Serra.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.607
Not until we're satisfied.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.859
- Why are you doing this?
Huh?

07:22.901 --> 07:24.110
Haven't we suffered enough?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.696
- Yes, you have suffered,
Mr. Serra.

07:26.738 --> 07:31.117
But we've grown to care about
your wife and your sons,

07:31.159 --> 07:32.702
also about you.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.329
Please call them back for us.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.830
Allay our fear.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.584
Let us walk away
knowing your family's safe.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.878
- I talked to my mom, too.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.339
My dad is telling you
the truth.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.799
- Hi, Danny.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.011
Which dad is telling
the truth?

07:57.644 --> 08:00.146
What exactly did your mom
say to you, Danny?

08:00.188 --> 08:03.316
- That she's coming home
to be with us,

08:03.358 --> 08:06.069
and she's never leaving again.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.113
My first dad is.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.742
- He's lying to us.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.994
The number of the hotel
in Mexico doesn't answer.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.747
We also put a call into the
Mexico City Police Department.

08:17.789 --> 08:18.915
I guess the--

08:18.957 --> 08:20.417
- OK, we need units
set up here

08:20.458 --> 08:22.127
and units to watch
the Hanney yacht.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.211
For how long?

08:23.253 --> 08:25.171
- Till we have enough
to arrest Paul--

08:25.213 --> 08:28.133
or Hanney if his harassment
escalated into something else.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.010
- You think Hanney might
be the second father?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.469
- I don't know.
Kids are involved.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.638
We need to proceed
with caution.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.144
- Catch that slip when Paul
was talking about the transfer?

08:39.185 --> 08:40.854
- Elisabeth didn't lose
the family's nest egg.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.148
Paul did.
- OK, airline got back to me.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.150
Paul bought three tickets
from Mexico City.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.985
They leave
in less than 12 hours,

08:47.027 --> 08:49.320
and we don't have nearly enough
to stop them from traveling,

08:49.362 --> 08:50.780
let alone to arrest him.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.199
- 12 hours is what we've got
to either clear or convict

08:53.241 --> 08:55.785
Paul Serra or Peter Hanney
of killing Elisabeth.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.164
After that, I fear both
will be gone for good.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.749
[engine starts]

09:08.006 --> 09:09.132
- Nope, sorry.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.759
I refuse to accept
service of process.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.885
I'm hungry.
- You have to accept it.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.345
It's a subpoena.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.846
- You're supposed to serve
the custodian of records.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.431
Not me.
- That'll take two weeks.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.183
- We already gave you people
the Serras' account information

09:18.224 --> 09:19.642
from your last subpoena.
- You people?

09:19.684 --> 09:23.188
That's not very friendly.
- Well, you know, I'm fed up.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.273
You come here during lunch,
expect me to forego

09:25.315 --> 09:26.691
a precious few moments
of me time, and--

09:26.733 --> 09:28.985
- I'm sorry if you think
this is a waste of your time,

09:29.027 --> 09:32.947
but this is how criminal
investigations actually work.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.450
Two little boys
have lost their mother.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.202
We are trying to find her.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.373
You can hinder us or help us.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.333
- And while you're doing it,
we'll buy you lunch.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.709
Anything you want.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.086
He's paying.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.468
I thought crypto
was untraceable.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.387
- Everybody thinks that,
but they're wrong.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.306
Truly, you can buy crypto
with cash or through a broker.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.433
- But if you move the money
out of the crypto universe,

10:00.475 --> 10:02.185
at some point,
it comes out in the open.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.353
It must.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.313
- Yeah, at which point
it's traceable.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.649
So you already have
their accounts.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.275
The wire transfers show
when they bought crypto

10:09.317 --> 10:11.403
from the broker,
Borns Crypto Services.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.570
See?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.906
And a few months later,
they cashed out

10:14.948 --> 10:16.658
and got a wire transfer back.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.368
- Can you see who cashed out?

10:18.410 --> 10:19.828
- Paul Serra.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.580
They're doing well,
keeping up with S&P,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.249
beating it substantially.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.336
This was the height
of their profits.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.047
- How does over $700,000

10:31.089 --> 10:33.842
suddenly crater
to basically zero?

10:33.883 --> 10:37.512
Paul losing that money must
have made him lose his mind.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.139
- Well, he got greedy.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.099
So to keep in the profits,
something compelled him

10:41.141 --> 10:42.642
to plow it into
something riskier.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.810
Lost it all.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.104
- What was the
riskier investment?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.690
- All I know is he
emptied their accounts

10:48.732 --> 10:50.650
and then wired it
to a clearinghouse

10:50.692 --> 10:52.569
called Alexandria Profits.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.778
I've heard of them.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.739
They promise huge returns.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.575
- So maybe we can figure out
who Alexandria Profits is

10:58.616 --> 11:00.577
by cross-checking it
against known places

11:00.618 --> 11:02.620
and then seeing
if there's any overlap.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.832
- Alexandria Profits,
the lighthouse of Alexandria.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.125
We don't need to look
for an overlap.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.585
We already know it.
- Oh.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.794
- Thank you.
- The club?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.171
- Yes.
- It's the club.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.138
Mr. Rasgon, good afternoon.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.808
We want to ask you about
Alexandria Profits.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.353
Was it named for
the famous lighthouse?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.523
- I wouldn't know.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.317
Give me a sec.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.117
All I can tell you
is that Alexandria Profits

11:41.159 --> 11:42.911
was mentioned by club members.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.537
- Which members?

11:44.579 --> 11:45.955
- Strange, I can't remember.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.374
- Mm.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.334
- Perhaps you could help us
with another matter.

11:49.376 --> 11:54.631
Something about Elisabeth
and a crypto investment?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.174
- I've told you all I know.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.510
- You never tell
all you know about anything.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.969
If you did,
you'd lose your job.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.471
Right?

12:01.513 --> 12:03.473
Discretion--
that's the name of the game?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.475
- From what I gather
from my colleague,

12:05.517 --> 12:09.354
these sorts of clubs
are also a kind of

12:09.396 --> 12:12.691
private stock exchange,
out of the public eye,

12:12.732 --> 12:17.070
a place to cut business deals,
exchange insider information.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.280
- Elisabeth was popular
with wealthy men.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.283
She must have picked up some
stock tips or crypto plays.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.369
- Yes, the Serras
got a tip on crypto,

12:24.411 --> 12:26.037
and they made a lot
of money from it.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.455
But then they lost it.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.082
People like that
can't hold on to money.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.750
- People like that?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.043
I thought you loved Elisabeth.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.378
- I'm not talking about her.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.713
She wasn't the one
who got the tip.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.339
- Paul?

12:36.381 --> 12:39.551
- This was Paul's big chance
to prove himself to Elisabeth,

12:39.592 --> 12:43.430
that he could give her
what he thought she wanted.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.974
He was installing one of those
radiant heat things

12:46.016 --> 12:47.392
for a member.
- Which member?

12:47.434 --> 12:50.061
- I don't know,
and it doesn't matter.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.731
Elisabeth was always
drumming up work for Paul.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.191
For once, Paul was at the
right place at the right time,

12:55.233 --> 12:56.609
and he made a healthy sell.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.236
Could have been
the start of a great life.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.155
But no,
because Paul's a fool,

13:00.196 --> 13:02.157
and he didn't listen
to Elisabeth's advice.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.743
He then lost it all.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.494
- Did Elisabeth quit her job

13:06.536 --> 13:08.955
because Mr. Hanney
was harassing her?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.832
- Harassing her?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.292
What, is that what
you call it now?

13:12.334 --> 13:14.627
We used to call it
being in love,

13:14.669 --> 13:16.171
especially when it's mutual.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.132
- Love?
- Yeah, the real thing.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.843
- Excuse me.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.470
I should get back to it.
- Mm.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.599
- Good luck, detectives.

13:30.769 --> 13:34.064
- There seem to be many
versions of Elisabeth.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.399
Maybe she was all the things
these men saw,

13:36.441 --> 13:38.985
separate parts of the true her.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.196
- Uh, no, bullshit.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.866
When it comes to women,
a lot of men

13:44.908 --> 13:47.285
just see whatever
they want to see.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.287
Susanna and the Elders.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.290
Two bad men exploit
a good woman.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.125
They offer her a choice.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.293
She either submits
to being raped,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.796
or they falsely accuse her
of adultery,

13:57.837 --> 14:01.508
which of course meant death.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.426
- Faced with this
impossible choice,

14:03.468 --> 14:05.387
she refuses to capitulate.

14:05.428 --> 14:09.307
Instead,
she screams for justice.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.104
- Elisabeth never got
a chance to scream.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.107
[dramatic music]

14:17.148 --> 14:20.735
* *

14:33.206 --> 14:35.458
- Rabbi, look,
I appreciate it,

14:35.500 --> 14:38.003
but we can't accept
gifts or outside food.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.546
- Outside?
What's outside?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.840
We're in your jurisdiction,
part of a grateful community.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.383
- But we can't--
- If you don't take it,

14:43.425 --> 14:45.176
I got to go give two
to the fire department.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.469
How is that fair?
- Oh.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.263
- It's a holiday basket.
Here, I tell you what.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.015
Give it to my friend,
Detective Avraham.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.975
He's an excellent sharer.
- It's the same thing.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.476
- Avi has a friend?

14:53.518 --> 14:55.395
- At least one that I know of.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.522
- [laughs] OK.
- And you would be?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.108
- I'm Detective Harris.
I'm a colleague of his.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.443
And he's just
parking the cruiser.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.486
He'll be right in.
Want me to take that for him?

15:03.528 --> 15:05.488
- Oh, would you? Yes.
- Yeah.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.073
- My wife, Mindy,
bought it for Sukkot.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.868
I didn't want to have to
take it back on the subway.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.244
You're the new partner.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.412
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.289
- Yeah, he talked about you.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.999
- Oh, really?

15:16.041 --> 15:17.334
Good things, I hope?

15:17.375 --> 15:19.002
- No, but he didn't
say bad things,

15:19.044 --> 15:20.128
which for him is a rave.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.172
- OK.
- Wow.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.214
- Don't worry.
I know you're very busy.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.507
I'm just dropping off
and leaving.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.384
Chag sameach.
See you later.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.345
And by that,
I mean, see you later.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.013
If you don't show up,
Mindy will be very upset.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.264
- I-I'll come.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.599
I'll do my best.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.726
- He said you're very smart.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.227
- Hmm.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.273
- What?
You are very smart.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.358
- Yeah, I'm just
trying to process

15:41.399 --> 15:42.817
that you have a friend.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.153
- Look, it took a while,
but the bank

15:45.195 --> 15:47.864
finally sent over copies
of everything in the Serras'

15:47.906 --> 15:49.991
safety deposit box,
and you're right.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.035
It's only on TV
that you get everything

15:52.077 --> 15:54.162
all at once, easy peasy.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.623
We printed photos
of the contents--

15:56.664 --> 15:59.376
stocks and bonds
for the boys,

15:59.417 --> 16:01.252
2018 will
that leaves everything

16:01.294 --> 16:03.672
to Paul and the boys.

16:03.713 --> 16:07.884
Letters from Hanney, here.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.637
And these.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.765
- These are just pictures
of her with Paul and Hanney.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.226
No pictures of her
with her sons.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.561
- These were her
private collection,

16:18.603 --> 16:21.815
special moments
with the men in her life.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.316
Both of them.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.943
- She looks happy
in all of them.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.946
- Leading a double life
can be dangerous.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.156
[speaking in Hebrew]

16:30.198 --> 16:33.076
You can't dance
at two weddings.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.078
- Maybe she could.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.249
And it was the men in her life
that couldn't handle it.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.710
- You're right.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.714
The question is,
which man killed her?

16:53.138 --> 16:55.140
- Have you found Elisabeth?

16:55.181 --> 16:56.766
- Oh, not yet.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.435
But we do know
that you loved her

16:58.476 --> 17:00.562
and that you wanted her
to leave her husband,

17:00.603 --> 17:03.481
and when she wouldn't,
you continued to harass her.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.607
- Bullshit.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.817
We were trying
to figure it out.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.193
She loved me back.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.695
- Yes, but she wasn't
going to run away with you.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.447
- You don't know anything.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.573
She was planning on leaving him

17:11.614 --> 17:12.782
and would have
if he hadn't killed her.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.117
- The only way you
could make her run

17:14.159 --> 17:16.119
was by taking away
absolutely everything from her

17:16.161 --> 17:17.871
and giving her no choice.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.914
And she wasn't even
running to you.

17:19.956 --> 17:22.167
She was on her way
to Mexico with the kids.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.419
And she would have gotten there
if you hadn't killed her first.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.129
- What is this?
What are you talking about?

17:26.171 --> 17:27.297
I didn't kill her.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.798
- You stole the Serras' money.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.051
- You think I cared
about their money?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.552
This is ridiculous.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.262
- In the lobby of your club,

17:34.304 --> 17:35.889
there's a drawing
of Alexandria,

17:35.930 --> 17:38.308
a famous port city
beloved by sailors,

17:38.350 --> 17:40.268
built by Alexander the Great,

17:40.310 --> 17:41.978
a place you visited many times.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.146
- So what?

17:43.188 --> 17:44.564
- You also employ
a vast array

17:44.606 --> 17:47.359
of computer engineers,
financial experts.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.985
It would be easy for you
to fool others

17:49.027 --> 17:52.906
with a fake hedge fund account
promising fabulous returns,

17:52.947 --> 17:55.492
and name it
for your favorite port.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.328
Paul Serra made money
from a tip about crypto.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.496
- He got lucky.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.997
- Oh, and you
couldn't stand it.

18:01.039 --> 18:04.334
Once Paul was rich,
Elisabeth's life was perfect.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.794
The boys were taken care of.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.671
All of her dreams came true.

18:07.712 --> 18:08.838
- She had no reason to leave,

18:08.880 --> 18:10.674
so you took from Paul
his wealth,

18:10.715 --> 18:12.676
his dignity, and self-worth.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.095
And by doing so,
you hoped to take his wife.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.846
- Time for my lawyer
to step in on this.

18:16.888 --> 18:17.847
- Oh, of course.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.392
And you probably
will avoid prison.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.268
But you did steal
the Serras' money.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.895
You are Alexandria Profits,

18:23.937 --> 18:27.065
and Alexandria Profits
is a fraudulent company.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.068
It's a fraud, just like you.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.862
Somewhere along the line,
I don't care where you grew up

18:32.904 --> 18:35.949
or how,
you left your honor behind.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.076
- You tricked the Serras
into transferring

18:38.118 --> 18:39.285
their family wealth.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.745
- I'll take a lie detector.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.038
I didn't fucking kill her.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.707
- That doesn't mean
you're innocent.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.542
- Being rich is not a crime.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.710
- Oh, you didn't
need the money.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.044
You needed Elisabeth.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.171
And the only way
that you could get her

18:50.213 --> 18:53.341
was to destroy her marriage
and destroying her life.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.884
- Hey.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.177
I loved her.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.430
We could have been good
together, with the boys.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.890
And I would never hurt her.

19:00.932 --> 19:04.144
And anyone who says I did
is fucking lying!

19:04.185 --> 19:05.770
- You may not be the killer,
Mr. Hanney,

19:05.812 --> 19:07.897
but you're not innocent either.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.984
We may never prove that you
committed a financial theft.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.236
Not all crimes
can be prosecuted,

19:13.278 --> 19:15.363
but all sins are punished.

19:15.405 --> 19:18.408
You were not the actual cause
of Elisabeth's death,

19:18.450 --> 19:23.163
but you were the proximate
cause, morally responsible.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.082
If we can't make you
pay for it in this life,

19:26.124 --> 19:29.336
believe me, God will.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.130
And your money won't save you.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.008
[tense music]

19:40.764 --> 19:43.224
[suspenseful music]

19:43.266 --> 19:46.227
[sirens wailing]

19:46.269 --> 19:52.859
* *

19:52.901 --> 19:54.152
- We can't go in, Avi.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.613
We have nothing new
to justify it.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.157
- I don't care.
The boys are in danger.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.950
We're going in.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.745
- What happened with Hanney?

20:03.787 --> 20:05.163
- He's taking a poly,
just to be sure,

20:05.205 --> 20:06.915
but I really don't think
he killed her.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.333
- Any developments here?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.751
- We've had it covered
the whole time.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.544
Uniform saw Paul come out
one time to get food,

20:11.586 --> 20:12.796
went right back in.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.006
Ever since,
no one's come in or out.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.801
- NYPD, Mr. Serra.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.220
Open the door.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.098
Police, open up!

20:23.139 --> 20:27.519
* *

20:27.560 --> 20:29.396
- Door's down.
Move in, move in.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.191
- Paul, where are you?

20:38.029 --> 20:39.989
I've got the kids here.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.199
- [indistinct shouting]

20:41.241 --> 20:42.617
Back room, clear.

20:42.659 --> 20:43.660
- Danny?

20:43.702 --> 20:45.620
Danny?
- Bedroom, clear.

20:45.662 --> 20:46.913
- Their pulse is low.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.540
They've been drugged!

20:48.581 --> 20:50.333
- Clear!

20:50.375 --> 20:51.710
- 74 squad to Central.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.962
I need a bus
at 1115 Franklin Street.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.213
Tell them to hurry.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.965
I have two
unconscious children.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.426
- Copy that.
EMS is ten minutes out.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.471
Where is he?

21:03.513 --> 21:06.182
- Apartment's empty.
I don't know how he got out.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.486
[mysterious music]

21:18.528 --> 21:25.452
* *

21:53.021 --> 21:55.815
- Back bedroom!

21:55.857 --> 21:57.317
Give me a hand.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.327
Officer, give me your light.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.922
Clear.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.896
Those are drag marks.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.444
- Blood. Plastic.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.158
- You're fucking Peter Hanney?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.869
- I'm leaving you, Paul!
- Is this about the money?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.413
Come on!
I can earn it back!

22:51.454 --> 22:53.415
Just give me a chance!
- It's not about the money!

22:53.456 --> 22:58.253
It's about you
and the type of man you are!

22:58.294 --> 22:59.421
[grunts]

23:01.965 --> 23:03.591
- [shouts]

23:03.633 --> 23:06.344
- [grunting]

23:06.386 --> 23:09.305
[unhinged music]

23:09.347 --> 23:11.599
* *

23:11.641 --> 23:14.853
[saw whirring]

23:35.165 --> 23:37.375
- Paul Serra killed his wife.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.962
The bomb scare was an unlucky,
random event,

23:41.004 --> 23:44.090
as was you taking his photo.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.842
But if not for that,
we never would have known

23:45.884 --> 23:49.137
Elisabeth was missing.

23:49.179 --> 23:50.388
He must have done this work

23:50.430 --> 23:51.848
when the boys
were out of the apartment.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.309
- Yeah, and with us on him,
he had to speed things up,

23:54.351 --> 23:57.979
which meant drugging the boys
when it was time to move her.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.856
- I know where he is.

23:59.898 --> 24:02.817
- [shaky breathing]

24:02.859 --> 24:05.862
[dramatic music]

24:05.904 --> 24:08.573
[footsteps approaching]

24:14.371 --> 24:16.164
- I fini--I finished it
on schedule.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.166
They owe me my $5,000 bonus.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.001
Will you make sure
that my boys get it?

24:20.043 --> 24:22.587
- Drop the weapon!

24:22.629 --> 24:25.590
- [muttering]
It's...

24:31.888 --> 24:33.348
I couldn't do it.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.892
I couldn't leave them orphans.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.353
- Send up EMS.
We have a knife wound.

24:38.395 --> 24:41.648
- You wanted to die here
with her.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.941
You're too much of a craftsman

24:42.982 --> 24:45.860
to choose any place
you didn't build.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.529
Tell the evidence techs

24:47.570 --> 24:50.407
Elisabeth is directly
beneath that spot.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.087
- A true confession requires

25:04.129 --> 25:06.715
a complete
and detailed account.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.759
- If you want the truth,

25:09.801 --> 25:14.222
God hates me,
and I hate Him back.

25:16.224 --> 25:17.809
When Elisabeth and I
first got together,

25:17.851 --> 25:20.437
I couldn't believe it.

25:20.478 --> 25:23.023
I thought I was the
luckiest man in the world.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.524
Here was this
beautiful woman

25:24.566 --> 25:28.028
who wanted to give me
everything, two beautiful kids,

25:28.069 --> 25:29.738
a house, a life.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.656
- And you were
a wonderful father.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.324
- Yes, I was.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.537
- But you became angry.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.749
Resentful.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.418
Your son couldn't
process the change.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.755
Danny imagined a first dad

25:46.796 --> 25:49.090
and a second dad.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.510
- But you were both of them.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.721
- I worked my ass off
to get her the kind of money

25:54.763 --> 25:58.308
that she needed,
but it was just...

25:58.350 --> 25:59.934
never enough.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.354
- The information you received
about the crypto investment

26:02.395 --> 26:04.272
must have felt like
a message from God.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.607
- And then,
when it was all taken away,

26:05.648 --> 26:07.442
it must have felt like a curse.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.943
And then,
when a billionaire like Hanney

26:08.985 --> 26:10.820
comes and tries to take your
wife away from you, I mean--

26:10.862 --> 26:14.616
- That fucking guy had
nothing to do with it.

26:17.327 --> 26:20.830
- She was in love with him.

26:20.872 --> 26:24.334
- She told you the truth
about her affair.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.503
It wasn't about
the money at all.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.338
She did fall in love
with Hanney.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.298
Hearing that, you lost control.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.175
- And you killed her.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.390
- Tell me, Paul.

26:38.431 --> 26:42.268
Did you believe you deserved
this financial windfall?

26:42.310 --> 26:44.521
[soft dramatic music]

26:44.562 --> 26:45.814
- Yes.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.649
- Of course you did.

26:47.691 --> 26:52.153
Because you were
a perfect and upright man.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.280
Like Job, you were favored.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.407
But then, seemingly,

26:55.448 --> 26:57.325
for no reason,
you were laid low,

26:57.367 --> 27:00.495
made to suffer the loss
of riches of hope,

27:00.537 --> 27:03.623
as if you had committed
some unpardonable sin,

27:03.665 --> 27:05.291
though you had
committed no sin.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.793
- And what kind of god
does that?

27:06.835 --> 27:09.170
A pretty fucking terrible one,
if you ask me.

27:09.212 --> 27:11.172
- Maybe the issue isn't God.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.717
Maybe you are the issue.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.677
- I never claimed
to be perfect.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.053
- Yeah, no shit.

27:17.095 --> 27:18.888
- Guy's a sociopath.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.850
- I think you're someone else
in the Bible.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.351
- Who?

27:23.393 --> 27:26.521
- A great man,
greater than Job.

27:26.563 --> 27:28.773
A builder of cities.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.859
A man like you
used his sacred skill

27:30.900 --> 27:33.653
to produce the first
great manmade things.

27:33.695 --> 27:36.740
His only flaw was jealousy.

27:36.781 --> 27:40.702
So when another more pleasing
man won favor in God's eyes,

27:40.744 --> 27:43.329
the man who worked with
his hand picked up a rock

27:43.371 --> 27:46.082
and smashed God's
more favorite's brains out.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.208
You're not Job.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.502
You're Cain,
the first murderer.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.379
You cursed God when
you murdered Elisabeth,

27:51.421 --> 27:52.714
but you are not God.

27:52.756 --> 27:55.216
Can you stretch the heavens
above the Earth?

27:55.258 --> 27:57.260
Do you give the horse
its strength?

27:57.302 --> 27:59.721
Can you catch a whale
with a hook?

27:59.763 --> 28:01.723
When God favored you,
you loved Him!

28:01.765 --> 28:03.600
When He tested you,
you destroyed

28:03.641 --> 28:06.394
His most precious creation,
life!

28:06.436 --> 28:09.105
The mother of your children!

28:09.147 --> 28:15.403
And like Cain, you have
rightly earned God's curse.

28:15.445 --> 28:22.577
* *

28:23.995 --> 28:26.247
- Oh, that's it.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.625
- I'll start the paperwork.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.925
- I would like to be the one

28:36.966 --> 28:38.635
who tells my children
what happened.

28:38.677 --> 28:42.347
It's best if it comes from me.
[door clicks]

28:42.389 --> 28:44.891
- Ready when you are, Avi.
[keys jingle]

28:44.933 --> 28:47.060
- The best thing you can do
for your boys now

28:47.102 --> 28:52.065
is to let Dr. Sands and their
grandparents help them heal.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.986
That would be the act
of a truly loving father.

28:57.028 --> 29:01.741
I believe that would be
what the first dad would do.

29:01.783 --> 29:06.996
Don't speak to them ever again.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.711
- Hmm.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.130
I guess you're right.
[handcuffs rattle]

29:15.171 --> 29:17.173
- All right.
Let's go.

29:17.215 --> 29:19.884
- [yelling]

29:19.926 --> 29:22.095
- Earl!

29:22.137 --> 29:23.555
- [yelling]

29:25.181 --> 29:27.100
- Avi!

29:27.142 --> 29:29.561
- Earl, are you OK?
- [groans] I'm good.

29:29.602 --> 29:33.356
- Hey, lock the door!
Don't let him out!

29:33.398 --> 29:34.858
- Hey!

29:38.445 --> 29:40.613
- Paul, stop!

29:45.118 --> 29:47.996
[tense music]

29:48.038 --> 29:54.169
* *

29:54.210 --> 29:57.130
- [panting]

30:00.383 --> 30:03.511
- It's done, Paul.

30:03.553 --> 30:06.890
This is not the way.

30:06.931 --> 30:11.936
* *

30:11.978 --> 30:13.897
- [exhales]

30:19.527 --> 30:20.528
- Avi!

30:20.570 --> 30:21.988
[gunshots]

30:28.078 --> 30:31.915
- First goddamn time I ever had
to fire my weapon on the job.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.124
- We need backup.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.501
Suspect's down.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.711
- Shit.

30:40.423 --> 30:43.093
- You OK, boss?

31:02.987 --> 31:04.114
- [sighs]

31:04.155 --> 31:07.784
- Sometimes I wish
we had nonlethal ways

31:07.826 --> 31:10.328
to stop lethal threats.

31:10.370 --> 31:15.208
- Yeah.
In a better world, my friend.

31:15.250 --> 31:18.003
I'm gonna stay until Davies
is done with internal affairs,

31:18.044 --> 31:19.796
and then I'm going
to clock out.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.881
I'm just beat.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.758
I don't think
it'll take that long.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.928
I mean, it was basically
suicide by cop.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.808
- What I said to him
at the end about

31:31.850 --> 31:33.560
not speaking to his sons--

31:33.601 --> 31:35.395
- Yeah.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.230
All of it was true.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.232
- But not necessary.

31:39.274 --> 31:43.153
Sometimes not even the truth
needs to be spoken.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.779
- Hmm.

31:50.744 --> 31:53.705
- Did I drive him to do this?

31:54.831 --> 31:57.584
- Avi, that is crazy.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.837
No, of course not.

32:00.879 --> 32:04.632
He was an evil man,
and he made evil choices.

32:04.674 --> 32:07.260
And he was going
to get away with that.

32:07.302 --> 32:09.804
- [sighs]

32:14.809 --> 32:18.980
[sighs]
Avi...

32:19.022 --> 32:22.650
Thank you for being
my partner.

32:22.692 --> 32:26.154
You really taught me something.

32:26.196 --> 32:27.864
- Just one thing?

32:27.906 --> 32:30.492
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.453
How to be a mensch.

32:33.495 --> 32:35.705
And that's not just one thing.

32:35.747 --> 32:38.917
In this job,
it's kind of everything.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.878
[gentle music]

32:41.920 --> 32:49.052
* *

32:56.393 --> 32:57.477
- Hey, kid.

32:57.519 --> 32:58.978
Hey.
- Oh.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.105
- Daddy!

33:00.146 --> 33:02.899
- Hey.
Oh, take it easy.

33:02.941 --> 33:03.942
Yeah, that's okay.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.985
- Hey.
- Hi, how you doing?

33:06.027 --> 33:07.612
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

33:07.654 --> 33:08.738
How you doing?
- Good.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.031
- Did you do your homework?
- Yeah.

33:10.073 --> 33:11.241
- OK.

33:11.282 --> 33:12.826
Maggie,
you're gonna miss your bus.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.619
All right. Have a good day.

33:14.661 --> 33:15.745
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.789
- Bye, honey.

33:23.253 --> 33:25.296
[knock at door]

33:28.550 --> 33:30.510
- Hi.

33:30.552 --> 33:31.886
How you doing?

33:31.928 --> 33:34.180
- It is what it is.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.224
You guys get your gun,
cells, laptops.

33:36.266 --> 33:38.727
Got the all-clear?
- Yeah.

33:41.813 --> 33:44.691
Captain,
why don't you just go home?

33:44.733 --> 33:47.485
- Plenty of time
to stew in it.

33:47.527 --> 33:50.030
I'm on administrative leave

33:50.071 --> 33:52.741
till I can see
the department shrink,

33:52.782 --> 33:55.452
who is booked up
for a few days.

33:55.493 --> 33:59.039
- A few days?
- Mm-hmm.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.125
- You should take
more time than that.

34:02.167 --> 34:05.295
- If I need to, I will.

34:05.337 --> 34:08.506
Thanks.

34:08.548 --> 34:11.885
- I'm sorry it fell upon you
to protect us.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.846
- Part of the job,
protecting you guys.

34:14.888 --> 34:19.225
That's what being in charge
is all about.

34:19.267 --> 34:22.312
So be careful
what you wish for.

34:22.354 --> 34:28.693
* *

34:28.735 --> 34:31.446
OK.

34:31.488 --> 34:33.406
[keyboard clacking]

34:46.920 --> 34:50.882
[upbeat jazzy music]

34:50.924 --> 34:53.134
- The sukkah,
which, not to brag,

34:53.176 --> 34:56.096
I built with my own hands,

34:56.137 --> 34:58.223
it celebrates our exodus
from Egypt.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.308
We eat dinner at it
every night,

35:00.350 --> 35:03.228
and it celebrates
the harvest

35:03.269 --> 35:06.648
and reminds us
of our desert wanderings.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.400
- And how long do you do that?

35:08.441 --> 35:10.068
- Seven days.

35:10.110 --> 35:14.406
- How'd they come up with that?
Why not six days or eight days?

35:14.447 --> 35:17.158
- God told Moses, right after
he gave him the tablets,

35:17.200 --> 35:18.618
God brought Moses
back up the mountain

35:18.660 --> 35:20.036
and gave him all the rules.

35:20.078 --> 35:22.288
- Why didn't He put the rules
on the tablets?

35:22.330 --> 35:23.915
- How many more
questions do you have?

35:23.957 --> 35:25.792
- How long do you have?

35:25.834 --> 35:27.293
- I like her.

35:27.335 --> 35:28.962
- She's gonna be my boss.
- Forget your boss.

35:29.004 --> 35:29.963
She should be everybody's boss.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.798
You should run for office.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.966
- I'm planning to.

35:33.008 --> 35:34.926
- Oh, you're already there.
- Mm-hmm.

35:34.968 --> 35:36.553
Good for you.

35:36.594 --> 35:39.180
Don't hide your light.
That's what I say.

35:39.222 --> 35:41.057
Oh, Mindy just gave me a look.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.601
All right, everybody,
we're not getting any younger!

35:43.643 --> 35:46.146
Quick prayer, and then we eat!

35:46.187 --> 35:47.939
- [whispers]
I like him.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.862
- [speaking in Hebrew]

35:58.867 --> 36:00.910
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.084
- Yeah.

36:08.126 --> 36:10.295
All right.
Pass it down.

36:10.337 --> 36:13.423
Don't everyone rush
the table at once now.

36:13.465 --> 36:14.799
- Pickles? Yeah?

36:14.841 --> 36:16.676
- Yeah, I'll start
with the pickles.

36:16.718 --> 36:18.261
If you don't mind.

36:18.303 --> 36:21.097
- OK, OK, wow, wow.
- Thank you very much.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.557
- What is this?

36:22.599 --> 36:24.726
- It's stuffed cabbage.
- Oh, I love it.

36:24.768 --> 36:25.769
- Come on, Avi!
- I love it.

36:25.810 --> 36:28.521
[laughter and chatter]

36:28.563 --> 36:30.065
[phone ringing]

36:42.577 --> 36:44.454
Hello?

36:47.957 --> 36:50.043
[siren wailing, dog barks]

36:50.085 --> 36:53.421
[ominous music]

36:53.463 --> 37:00.387
* *

37:37.048 --> 37:41.261
* *

37:41.302 --> 37:43.388
- That looks like--

37:43.430 --> 37:44.973
- Hebrew.

37:45.015 --> 37:48.018
- Well, what does it say?

37:49.394 --> 37:52.147
- Aba.

37:52.188 --> 37:54.441
It means "father."

37:54.482 --> 37:55.900
[radio chirps]
- All units be advised.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.569
A new description
of the murder suspect,

37:57.610 --> 38:00.613
last seen fleeing on foot,
eastbound--

38:00.655 --> 38:03.575
6 feet, red hair,
possibly homeless man,

38:03.616 --> 38:06.911
40 to 50 years old, wounded
and bleeding from the face.

38:06.953 --> 38:09.247
- Did you hear that?

38:19.716 --> 38:21.426
- What are you doing?

38:24.554 --> 38:26.056
- [grunts]

38:35.273 --> 38:37.192
Wentworth has a disagreement
with someone,

38:37.233 --> 38:39.152
he pulls the trigger.

38:39.194 --> 38:43.823
- Arrives home,
but he has no home.

38:43.865 --> 38:45.950
Uses a gun.

38:45.992 --> 38:48.161
But he has no gun.

38:48.203 --> 38:50.622
- So he's the killer.

38:50.663 --> 38:52.957
And he's the victim.

38:52.999 --> 38:56.378
* *

38:58.380 --> 39:00.840
- He was my friend.

39:00.882 --> 39:03.843
[somber music]

39:03.885 --> 39:08.098
* *

39:08.139 --> 39:10.141
"Woe unto them

39:10.183 --> 39:14.854
"that call evil good,
and good evil.

39:14.896 --> 39:20.193
That put darkness for light,
and light for darkness."

39:24.739 --> 39:29.160
* *

39:29.202 --> 39:32.288
[praying in Hebrew]

39:40.672 --> 39:47.595
