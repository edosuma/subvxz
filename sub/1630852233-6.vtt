all the talking kids,

A Philly 11.
[ Laughs ]

17:08.527 --> 17:11.113
You deserve options.
I get options ‐‐

17:11.113 --> 17:14.367
baked chips, classic chips,
cupcakes, sour candy,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.535
granola, local,
big names.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.373
The world's
your vending machine.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.874
Well, I would still like

17:21.874 --> 17:23.751
to go out for dinner,
if you're interested.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.753
Oh, hell yeah.
How about this?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.589
Me, you, Scannicchio's?

17:28.589 --> 17:32.009
Oh, yeah, that's where
my ex proposed that we,

17:32.009 --> 17:33.844
you know, get a divorce,
so, you know,

17:33.844 --> 17:36.180
not there, but we'll ‐‐
we'll figure out a place.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.684
I knew that chip metaphor
would work.

[ Laughs ]

17:41.519 --> 17:44.897
Oh, you know, speaking of
options, I would love it

17:44.897 --> 17:49.068
if some SnackWell's could find
their way back into Row E.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.236
Please.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.571
I'll see what I can do.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.905
Alright.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.745
Yeah, he'll get 'em.
I'm a Philly 11.

[ Snaps fingers ]

18:01.497 --> 18:04.083
You so smart.
My little Science Oprah

18:04.083 --> 18:05.710
goin' crazy
in the botanies.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.044
Do you mean botany?

18:07.044 --> 18:09.213
That's what I said.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.632
Anyway, my friend Crystal is
always bragging

18:11.632 --> 18:13.551
about how her kids
are so smart.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.721
Obviously,
I have the smartest kids.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.139
Maybe you can make a video

18:18.139 --> 18:19.890
memorizing the periodic table
or something.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.142
Send that to Crystal.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.476
What do you do here?

18:22.476 --> 18:23.728
I'm the principal.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.605
But you don't do anything.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.285
We shuttin' this down.
He gettin' too smart.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.454
Oh, no, wait.
Actually, we were all

18:41.454 --> 18:43.122
just talking about
the gifted program,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.457
and we have a solution.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.876
Oh, good,
'cause Black Bobby Fischer

18:46.876 --> 18:48.502
is killin' me right now.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.922
Okay, um, well,
we thought instead of a few kids

18:51.922 --> 18:54.091
getting to do something special
every week,

18:54.091 --> 18:56.427
what if every kid
got to do something special

18:56.427 --> 18:57.595
every few weeks?

18:57.595 --> 18:59.180
This way,
no kid feels left out.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.015
We consider all the
intelligences they could have.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.767
We get everyone excited
about learning.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.685
And, you know,
Jacob will still teach.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.936
We'll help.
Yes.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.147
"O Captain! My Captain!"
for everyone.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.484
So, if everyone's special,
then no one's special.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.153
Works for me.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.575
What do you normally do
after school, anyway?

19:19.575 --> 19:20.826
Work out,
watch "Jeopardy!"

19:20.826 --> 19:22.161
Work out
and watch "Jeopardy!"?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.496
Yeah, at the same time.
It stimulates

19:23.496 --> 19:24.830
the body and the mind.
That's cool.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.248
Uh...
Oh.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.833
Are you okay?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.293
Yeah, yeah.
I, um ‐‐

19:29.293 --> 19:31.295
I can't open the door
or they'll escape.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.797
Who will escape?

19:32.797 --> 19:34.298
I found the seventh and
eighth snake, okay?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.883
They were ‐‐
They were in my bag.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.136
Oh, no.
And, um...
now they're in my car.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.971
Oh, God.
Um...

19:40.971 --> 19:44.475

the gifted program.

Mm‐hmm.

[ Laughs ]

19:49.188 --> 19:51.857
That sucks,
how you had to come up,

19:51.857 --> 19:54.360
like, not thinking
you're special.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.363
I mean, I really hope you don't
carry that with you,

19:57.363 --> 20:00.199
because I think
you're gifted.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.368
Just not as gifted as me.
[ Both laugh ]

20:02.368 --> 20:03.869
Oh, oh, is that so?
Okay.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.371
That is.
That is so.

20:05.371 --> 20:10.835
Um, but, in all seriousness,
Gregory,

20:10.835 --> 20:13.838
I was just thinking, um...

20:13.838 --> 20:15.423
do you need me to back your car
out for you?

20:15.423 --> 20:17.007
Because I can do that.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.342
You know, I have the brain
that it takes to ‐‐

20:21.178 --> 20:23.013
Alright, see you later.
I'll see you.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.354
I'm really happy Gregory's
opening up.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.148
I mean, he's great,

20:32.148 --> 20:35.901
and it's really nice to have
another friend at the school.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.155
What?

20:42.408 --> 20:45.244
Today, I learned that snake eggs
and chicken eggs look alike.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.747
We never got to do fun stuff
at my old school.

Oh, God! Aah!

I like Principal Coleman.
She's like a big kid.

and she doesn't have a job.

There's one area of giftedness
that always goes overlooked.

I've started
a gifted custodian program.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.105
It's like reverse
"Good Will Hunting".
