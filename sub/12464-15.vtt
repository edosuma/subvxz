00:04.938 --> 00:06.739
OOH!  A PACKAGE.

00:06.741 --> 00:08.774
WAIT, WHAT'S IN IT?
A NEW BLOUSE?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.142
A NEW BAG?

00:10.144 --> 00:13.112
UNDERWEAR THAT DOESN'T GO
ALL THE WAY UP TO YOUR WAIST?

00:13.114 --> 00:16.615
IT IS AN ANTIQUE WASHBOARD.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.251
OH!
ISN'T SHE A BEAUT?

00:19.253 --> 00:21.587
IT'S GOING TO HELP

00:21.589 --> 00:23.722
MADDIE AND ME WIN
THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER CHALLENGE

00:23.724 --> 00:26.125
AT JESSUP'S PIONEER TRAIL
THIS WEEKEND.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.527
UGH!  IS THAT
THAT WOODSY PLACE

00:28.529 --> 00:29.728
THAT MADDIE AND I USED
TO GO TO ON FIELD TRIPS

00:29.730 --> 00:30.996
WHERE THE HIGHLIGHT
WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM

00:30.998 --> 00:32.998
WHILE SITTING ON A LOG?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.968
YEP!  MADDIE AND I HAVE
BEEN DOING THIS CHALLENGE

00:35.970 --> 00:37.536
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.838
YOU CAMP IN THE WOODS

00:39.840 --> 00:42.307
AND LIVE LIKE PEOPLE DID
IN THE 1800s.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.643
ARE YOU BEING PUNISHED?

00:46.279 --> 00:48.313
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
MOTHER-DAUGHTER TEAM

00:48.315 --> 00:50.282

FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.154
YEAH, THIS IS
JUST A PICTURE

00:55.156 --> 00:56.622
'CAUSE MOM AND I
HAVE NEVER REALLY WON IT.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.290
WELL, ONE OF US ALWAYS
SEEMS TO GET LEPROSY

00:58.292 --> 00:59.658
OR FALL
INTO A WOLVERINE NEST

00:59.660 --> 01:01.093
- BEFORE WE GET ENOUGH POINTS.
- YEAH.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.595
AND BY ONE OF US,
I MEAN MADDIE.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.164
- MOM.
- HMM?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.999
I CAN SEE AND HEAR YOU.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.267
MM-HMM.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.869
UGH!  THIS ISN'T GOING
TO BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:10.871 --> 01:12.071
THAT YOU DRAG ME TO,
IS IT?

01:12.073 --> 01:14.273
( laughing )

01:15.708 --> 01:18.343
( laughs )

01:18.345 --> 01:19.945
WHY ARE WE LAUGHING?

01:19.947 --> 01:21.180
WHAT'S SO FUNNY
ABOUT ME GOING WITH YOU?

01:21.182 --> 01:22.681
ARE YOU INVITING ME
OR NOT?

01:22.683 --> 01:26.652
LIV, THIS IS ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE
OUTDOORSY LIVING.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.353
OF COURSE WE'RE NOT
INVITING YOU.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.290
HOW DARE SHE NOT
INVITE ME.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.725
SURE, IT SOUNDS GROSS

01:33.727 --> 01:34.927
AND DIRTY AND STUPID,

01:34.929 --> 01:36.328
BUT SHE SHOULD HAVE
AT LEAST ASKED.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.362
THEN I COULD HAVE
TURNED HER DOWN

01:37.364 --> 01:38.931
AND LAUGHED IN HER FACE.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.699
NO, YOU WOULDN'T
SURVIVE A DAY.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.829
I DON'T KNOW.
IT ALL WENT DOWN PRETTY QUICK.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.164
MRS. WAKEFIELD.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.332

02:58.311 --> 03:01.180
I AM HERE FOR

03:01.182 --> 03:05.217
WHO IS READY TO GET
THEIR PIONEER PAR-TAY ON?

03:06.319 --> 03:08.320
OH, HONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.189
I THOUGHT THIS WASN'T
YOUR KIND OF THING.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.090
YEAH, AND BESIDES,
MOM AND I ARE ALREADY

03:12.092 --> 03:14.092
DOING THIS TOGETHER
AND IT'S ONLY TEAMS OF TWO.

03:14.094 --> 03:17.930
THAT'S WHY I WENT OUT
AND RUSTLED UP A MOM.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.899
A MOM?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.768
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:22.770 --> 03:24.870
OH, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT
BREE DU MONDE.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.305
Both: BREE?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.307
BREE DU MONDE IS THE ACTRESS
WHO PLAYED MY MOM

03:28.309 --> 03:30.409
ON ♪ "SING IT LOUD!"

03:30.411 --> 03:31.843
SHE'S A TRIPLE THREAT--

03:31.845 --> 03:34.713
GOR-GENE, FAB-SMASH,
AND ROCK-A-DICULOUS.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.416

03:55.469 --> 03:57.002

03:57.004 --> 03:58.437
DAD IS OUT GOLFING.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.305

04:01.542 --> 04:03.108
WAY AHEAD OF YOU, DUDE.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.210
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M EATING
A RIB WITH MY FOOT?

04:07.947 --> 04:11.350
AS IMPRESSED WITH THAT
AS I AM...

04:11.352 --> 04:13.819
I'VE GOT BIGGER PLANS.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.421
YOU MEAN LIKE EATING
A DRUMSTICK WITH MY FOOT.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.060
OKAY, BUDDY,
I AM TALKING ABOUT

04:22.062 --> 04:24.463
A WAY TO MAKE
COLD, HARD CASH.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.497
YOU HAVE MY FULL ATTENTION.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.898
DON'T WASTE THIS MOMENT.

I'VE BEEN COLLECTING

04:40.514 --> 04:41.913

04:41.915 --> 04:45.083
CAN YOU SAY "GIFT SHOP"?

04:45.085 --> 04:47.452
I KNEW I'D CASH IN
ON HOW CREEPY YOU WERE

04:47.454 --> 04:49.554
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.390
WIPE THAT SAUCE
OFF YOUR FOOT.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.459
THE TOUR SHOWS UP
IN AN HOUR.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.361
HEY, GUYS.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.032
GOLF GOT CANCELED.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.500
BUMMER FOR ME.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.169
BUT WE GET TO SPEND
THE WEEKEND TOGETHER NOW

05:04.171 --> 05:07.005
FOR A LITTLE FATHER-SON
BONDING TIME.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.076
Both: YAY.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.313
SO WHILE MADDIE'S OFF
SKINNING LUNCH...

05:16.215 --> 05:18.350
WHY DON'T WE CATCH UP?

05:18.352 --> 05:21.186
BREE, IT IS SO GOOD
OF YOU TO COME

05:21.188 --> 05:23.188
AND SUPPORT LIV
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.890
WELL, KAREN,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.325
WHEN MY TV DAUGHTER
CALLED,

05:26.327 --> 05:28.327
I JUST CANCELED EVERYTHING
ON MY SCHEDULE TO BE HERE.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.361
( chuckles )

05:29.363 --> 05:31.029
JUST ONE
OF THOSE SITUATIONS

05:31.031 --> 05:33.298
WHERE I HAD TO DROP
A BUTT BOMB OF MOM ON IT.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.402
"DROP A BUTT BOMB
OF MOM ON IT"

05:37.404 --> 05:39.338
IS SOMETHING I USED TO SAY.

05:39.340 --> 05:43.175
BREE HEARD IT AND TURNED IT
INTO HER TV CHARACTER'S
CATCHPHRASE.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.344
SINCE THEN,
SHE'S MADE A FORTUNE

05:45.346 --> 05:47.579
DROPPING A BUTT BOMB
OF MOM ON COOKBOOKS,

05:47.581 --> 05:50.582
WORKOUT VIDEOS, AND YOGURT
THAT KEEPS YOU YOUNG.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.118
I HAVEN'T SAID IT SINCE.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.454
I REALLY MISS
THE BUTT BOMB.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.888
WELL, MOM--

05:56.890 --> 05:57.923
- YEAH, SUGAR?
- WHAT, SWEETIE?

05:57.925 --> 05:59.624
OH...

05:59.626 --> 06:02.260
OH, WOW!

06:02.262 --> 06:04.629
( sighs, winces )
THIS IS AWKWARD, ISN'T IT?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.331
( laughs )

06:06.333 --> 06:09.167
HADN'T REALLY
THOUGHT OF THAT.  HA HA!

06:09.169 --> 06:12.371
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO SET UP OUR TENT.

06:12.373 --> 06:16.341
AND I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND THE CAMPFIRE, KAREN?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.314
ALL RIGHT,
WE HAVE GOT TO THINK FAST.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.416
THE GIRLS COMING
FOR THE LIV ROONEY
RESIDENTIAL TOUR

06:24.418 --> 06:25.951
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE,

06:25.953 --> 06:29.054
AND DAD IS ACTING LIKE
HE OWNS THE PLACE.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.425
HE SORT OF DOES.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.360
WE NEED A PROJECT

06:35.362 --> 06:38.497
THAT WILL KEEP DAD BUSY.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.434
YOU KNOW HOW STRICT MOM IS
ABOUT WHAT GOES IN THE DISPOSAL.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.302
THAT'S GONNA BREAK IT.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.341
SHOVE IT IN.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.542
SHOVE IT ALL IN.

WITH THE DISPOSAL.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.494
YOU NEED TO FIX IT.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.496
THIS IS PERFECT.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.064
YOU KNOW HOW DAD
TAKES FOREVER

07:13.066 --> 07:15.600
TO DO PRETTY MUCH
ANYTHING.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.402
WHAT'D YOU DO?

07:19.205 --> 07:22.407
YOU KNOW HOW STRICT
YOUR MOM IS ABOUT WHAT GOES
IN THE DISPOSAL.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.309
YEP.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.479
IT'S JAMMED UP REAL GOOD.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.081
YOU CAN FIX IT, THOUGH--
RIGHT, DAD?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.384
OF COURSE HE CAN.
OUR FATHER'S A MAN'S MAN.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.586
HE CAN FIX ANYTHING.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.456
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S TIME FOR PETE

07:37.458 --> 07:40.392
TO GET HIS OLD
PLUMBER ON.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.366

NOT TO DISTURB

08:05.686 --> 08:07.719
ANY OF THE OTHER

08:07.721 --> 08:09.387
AND WE'RE WALKING.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.989
AND WE'RE WALKING.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.991
AND WE'RE WALKING.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.401
IT'S LIKE TAKING CANDY

WELCOME TO THE BEST
PLACE ON EARTH--

08:35.415 --> 08:36.448
THE PAST.

08:38.584 --> 08:41.553
TIME TO TURN IN
ALL MODERN-DAY DEVICES.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.089
OH, DEAR.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.758
UM...
( laughs )

08:48.294 --> 08:52.230
SO EXACTLY HOW LIKE
"MODERN" ARE WE TALKING?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.466
'CAUSE, I MEAN,
MY PHONE'S PRETTY OLD.

08:54.468 --> 08:57.536
I THINK I'VE HAD IT
FOR AT LEAST LIKE SIX MONTHS.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.305
WELL, IF THE PIONEERS DIDN'T
HAVE IT, NEITHER CAN YOU.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.477

YOUR HAIRBRUSHES.

WE'RE PIONEERS,
NOT ANIMALS.

09:14.388 --> 09:18.189
ON THE FRONTIER WOMEN WOULD
WHITTLE HAIR-GROOMING TOOLS

FIREWOOD.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.427

09:30.436 --> 09:31.670
DON'T WORRY, SUGAR.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.772
EVERYONE HAS THEIR PRICE.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.107
HOW ABOUT I TRADE YOU
THAT CURLING IRON

09:36.109 --> 09:38.376
FOR A SIGNED COPY OF
"A VERY BUTT BOMB CHRISTMAS"?

09:40.546 --> 09:43.448
OH, LIV, HONEY.
WE SHOULD TALK.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.351
I'M STARTING TO WONDER
IF YOU'RE UPSET THAT
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.452
( gasps )

09:47.454 --> 09:50.388
WHY EVER WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.557
YOU BROUGHT IN
A SUBSTITUTE MOM

09:52.559 --> 09:54.559
FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE COUNTRY.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.827
IT'S KIND OF A RED FLAG.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.597

BOOM!  DROPPED.

21:01.526 --> 21:04.362
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GOOD
IT FEELS TO BE CLEAN.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.930
YOU HAVE TO WORK
EXTRA HARD

21:05.932 --> 21:08.132
TO SCRUB LEECH SLIME
OFF OF YOUR FINGERS.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.167
( sighs )

21:10.169 --> 21:12.203
WELL, WELCOME HOME, MOM.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.371
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY,

21:13.373 --> 21:16.507
DAD DID SOME MANLY THINGS.

21:17.976 --> 21:20.144
INCLUDING UPGRADING
YOUR GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.446
- YOU BROKE IT, DIDN'T YOU?
- NOT THE POINT.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.815
PETE, ARE YOU SURE
YOU KNOW HOW

21:24.817 --> 21:26.317
TO INSTALL
A GARBAGE DISPOSAL?

21:26.319 --> 21:28.953
NOT THE POINT.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.388
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.
IT WORKS GREAT.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.023
WE TESTED IT WITH ALL
THE LEFTOVERS IN THE FRIDGE

21:32.025 --> 21:34.058
THAT WE COULDN'T EVEN GET
PARKER TO EAT.

21:38.330 --> 21:41.799
<i>( mechanical whirring )</i>

21:50.108 --> 21:51.942
<i>( whirring ceases )</i>

21:53.478 --> 21:56.981
THIS IS WHY
WE HAVE STRICT RULES

21:56.983 --> 21:59.283
ABOUT WHAT GOES
INTO THE DISPOSAL.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.592
I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, MUNCH.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.528
YOU CAME UP WITH
A RIDICULOUS IDEA

22:10.530 --> 22:12.596
AND YOU MADE IT WORK.

22:12.598 --> 22:15.533
THE BEST PART IS
NOBODY FOUND OUT.

22:16.868 --> 22:21.405
YOU TWO ARE SO BUSTED.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.874
WE'RE SORRY.
WE SHOULD--

22:25.377 --> 22:28.379
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

22:28.381 --> 22:32.016
OH, JUST THAT YOU COMPLETELY
SPACE-INVADED ME.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.019
IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE
MY FAVORITE HAIRBRUSH

22:35.021 --> 22:36.954
TO BRUSH OUT A CLOWN WIG,

22:36.956 --> 22:39.190
AT LEAST REMOVE
THE NASTY ORANGE HAIR

22:39.192 --> 22:41.158
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

22:42.994 --> 22:45.162
YEAH, YOU GOT US.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.431
WE WERE STEALING BRUSHES
AND COMBING CLOWN WIGS

22:47.433 --> 22:49.934
ALL WEEKEND.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.336
TOTALLY BUSTED.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.504
JUST DON'T LET IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

22:57.210 --> 23:01.679
I'LL GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS
IF YOU CAN GET ME THAT BRUSH.
