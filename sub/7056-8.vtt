00:01.825 --> 00:04.456
Why would we get her back
just to lose her again?

00:04.696 --> 00:07.781
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:07.816 --> 00:10.767
You must face this pain
together.

00:10.785 --> 00:12.769
The pain is her legacy
to you both.

00:12.787 --> 00:14.488
It's proof
that she was here.

00:14.539 --> 00:16.740
Our daughter dedicated
her life to freeing us.

00:16.774 --> 00:18.342
And now we're gonna
dedicate ours

00:18.376 --> 00:20.661
to making sure that
that means something.

00:20.712 --> 00:22.546
You got that look
on your face.

00:22.581 --> 00:23.506
What look?

00:23.531 --> 00:25.115
The look that says,
"I'm worried about you."

00:25.116 --> 00:26.467
Should I be?

00:26.501 --> 00:28.502
What have you done?

00:28.553 --> 00:29.887
The tech that gave them

00:29.921 --> 00:31.622
their advantage over us--
I have it now.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.241
You implanted one
in yourself?

00:34.276 --> 00:36.393
It gives me enough information
to determine

00:36.428 --> 00:38.329
their probable futures.

00:38.363 --> 00:42.283
We're going to avenge Etta.
Windmark's next.

Sorry I'm late.
That's okay.

01:30.398 --> 01:31.899
Where'd you get it?

01:31.950 --> 01:36.019
Let's just say it was
a souvenir for one of my men.

01:36.037 --> 01:39.156
And this identical to the one
that Peter used on himself?

01:39.190 --> 01:41.191
<i>Yeah, from the base</i>
<i>of the cranium.</i>

01:41.209 --> 01:44.078
So how is it activated?
I'm not sure.

01:44.129 --> 01:45.629
If Dr. Bishop finds out,

01:45.664 --> 01:49.049
we'd love to learn
anything we can about it.

01:49.084 --> 01:53.504
Olivia, if I had any inclination
of what Peter was doing...

01:53.538 --> 01:57.040
I know.

02:00.762 --> 02:03.147
Astrid said you were
getting low on ammunition.

02:03.181 --> 02:07.267
The resistance just raided
a weapons depot in Midtown.

02:07.318 --> 02:09.553
Take these for now.

02:09.571 --> 02:12.606
We'll arrange a meet
for more later.

02:12.657 --> 02:14.825
I've got to go.

02:14.859 --> 02:17.894
If there's anything else
I can do to help...

02:17.912 --> 02:19.896
Thank you, Anil.

03:43.615 --> 03:46.667
There.

04:21.452 --> 04:24.204

05:17.723 --> 05:20.058
This is tape eight.

05:20.093 --> 05:23.895
There is a scrapyard located
in the town of Fitchburg,

05:23.913 --> 05:26.915
<i>46 miles northwest of Boston.</i>

05:26.949 --> 05:28.566
You will got to Fitchburg

05:28.584 --> 05:32.070

electromagnet.

05:52.692 --> 05:54.526
Olivia. Good.
You're here.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.645
We freed another tape,

05:56.696 --> 05:58.263
<i>and we have to retrieve</i>
<i>a magnet</i>

05:58.281 --> 05:59.948
<i>Walter left in Fitchburg.</i>

06:04.454 --> 06:06.455
What's wrong?

06:11.961 --> 06:15.280
I don't understand.
When did Peter do this?

06:15.298 --> 06:18.616
I don't know.

06:18.634 --> 06:21.119
What's happening to him?
What are the manifestations?

06:21.137 --> 06:25.123
He's reading time
like they do,

06:25.141 --> 06:26.925
thinking ahead
like they can.

06:26.959 --> 06:29.394
He knows what I'm gonna say
before I say it.

06:29.429 --> 06:32.230
It's like it's him, but...
It isn't.

06:32.265 --> 06:33.682
<i>Walter, he's convinced</i>

06:33.733 --> 06:35.650
<i>that this is the only way</i>
<i>to beat them.</i>

06:35.685 --> 06:38.904
If you could find out
what it's doing to him

06:38.938 --> 06:40.739
or if there's a way
to neutralize it--

06:40.773 --> 06:44.459
I'll start running diagnostics
right away.

06:44.494 --> 06:46.828
Of course,
it's meant to be integrated

06:46.863 --> 06:50.365
with organic material.

06:50.416 --> 06:53.001
I need to see how it interacts
with an actual brain.

06:53.035 --> 06:55.537
And whose
did you have in mind?

06:56.839 --> 06:58.840
Perhaps
my porcupine man's.

06:58.875 --> 07:02.660
I preserved his brain
in formaldehyde.

07:02.678 --> 07:04.930
Could you go down
and bring it up, please?

07:04.964 --> 07:07.516
It needs to be submerged
in water immediately.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.548
It's Peter.

07:11.549 --> 07:13.616
Let me talk to him.

07:14.023 --> 07:15.640
Peter, where are you?

07:15.674 --> 07:17.309
<i>I'm in New York, Walter.</i>

07:17.343 --> 07:18.610
Peter, listen to me.

07:18.644 --> 07:21.062
You must come back
to the lab.

07:21.114 --> 07:23.698
<i>What you've done, son,</i>
<i>is extremely dangerous.</i>

07:23.733 --> 07:25.350
I can't do that.

07:25.368 --> 07:27.319
I called to warn you not
to go back to Etta's apartment.

07:27.353 --> 07:28.954
It's been compromised.

07:28.988 --> 07:30.789
<i>Please come back</i>
<i>to the lab, Peter.</i>

07:30.823 --> 07:33.291
We don't know
what we're dealing with here.

07:33.326 --> 07:35.693
I-I'm very frightened.

07:35.711 --> 07:38.497
W-we don't know what that device
is actually doing to you.

07:38.531 --> 07:40.715
<i>I understand why</i>
<i>you would be concerned.</i>

07:40.750 --> 07:43.084
But I also know there is nothing
that I could say

07:43.136 --> 07:44.453
that would change your mind.

07:44.487 --> 07:47.389
<i>You cannot possibly see</i>
<i>what I see.</i>

07:47.423 --> 07:50.392
Trust me when I tell you...

07:50.426 --> 07:52.093
I am in complete control.

07:52.145 --> 07:54.712
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>you are in control.</i>

07:54.730 --> 07:59.484
Son, you promised me.

07:59.519 --> 08:01.853
You said you would be
there for me.

08:01.887 --> 08:04.739
<i>Do you remember--</i>
<i>to keep</i> me <i>from slipping?</i>

08:04.774 --> 08:07.325
I need you.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.111
I'm begging you.

08:10.163 --> 08:14.266
Please come back in
and let me run some tests.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.234
I have to go, Walter.

08:16.252 --> 08:21.122
Do not go back
to Etta's apartment.

08:32.018 --> 08:34.302
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

08:34.352 --> 08:35.437
Did he say where he was?

08:35.471 --> 08:38.974
New York.
That's all.

08:39.025 --> 08:41.559
Etta's apartment isn't safe,

08:41.594 --> 08:43.528
and I don't know
where he's going.

08:46.315 --> 08:50.702
I-I can't stay here.
I'm crawling out of my skin.

08:50.736 --> 08:52.287
What are you doing?

08:52.321 --> 08:54.739
Well, you and Astrid need
to work on the tech,

08:54.773 --> 08:57.576
so I'm gonna try
and find this magnet.

08:57.610 --> 08:59.244
<i>Alone?</i>

08:59.278 --> 09:00.745
We have no other option.

09:00.779 --> 09:01.997
What about Peter?

09:02.048 --> 09:05.166
All I can do is just
keep our promise to Etta

09:05.218 --> 09:08.336
and--and stick
with the plan.

10:31.203 --> 10:32.921
Sorry.

10:32.972 --> 10:35.674
Please, let me.

10:37.677 --> 10:39.311
That's enough.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.458
<i>Morning.</i>

11:43.492 --> 11:45.326
Good morning.

11:45.361 --> 11:48.296
I'm Carlos.
How can I help you?

11:48.330 --> 11:51.666
I would like to barter
for a magnet.

11:53.719 --> 11:55.003
What'd you say?

11:55.054 --> 11:56.304
Uh, an electromagnet,

11:56.338 --> 11:58.973
like the one you have
on that crane.

12:04.129 --> 12:06.481
Wait here.

12:16.025 --> 12:17.992
I'd like to sell you
the piping,

12:18.027 --> 12:20.111
but I got people
depending on me,

12:20.145 --> 12:21.813
and they need to eat.

12:21.831 --> 12:24.916
I'm willing to barter.

12:24.950 --> 12:27.619
Let me know.

12:30.005 --> 12:31.506
What is it, Carlos?

12:31.540 --> 12:35.260
Got a woman outside.

12:35.294 --> 12:37.378
She's asking for a magnet.

12:47.807 --> 12:49.274
It's her.

12:52.645 --> 12:54.779
Send them.

12:54.814 --> 12:56.898
Send them now.

13:43.401 --> 13:45.352
My name is Simone.

13:48.856 --> 13:51.191
Carlos said you were interested
in a magnet.

13:51.209 --> 13:53.377
That's right.

13:53.411 --> 13:55.546
I know this is a little
out of the ordinary, but--

13:55.580 --> 13:57.197
Yes.

13:57.215 --> 13:59.800
We have it for you.

13:59.834 --> 14:02.603
We've been expecting you.

14:02.637 --> 14:06.056
Expecting me?

14:07.726 --> 14:10.010
I've been waiting many years
for someone to come

14:10.044 --> 14:12.146
for that magnet.

14:14.399 --> 14:16.900
Come.

14:16.935 --> 14:18.885
I'll show you.

14:35.704 --> 14:37.871
This is your truck.

14:37.905 --> 14:41.425
It's been your truck
for 21 years...

14:41.459 --> 14:42.926
To transport it.

14:42.961 --> 14:45.879
A man came here

14:45.913 --> 14:48.382
soon after
the invaders arrived.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.350
The man spoke
with my mother.

14:50.385 --> 14:52.720
They talked
for a long time.

14:52.754 --> 14:55.522
He said he had a way
to save the world...

14:55.557 --> 14:59.727
But he needed a giant magnet
to do it.

14:59.761 --> 15:04.815
Was his name Walter?
Walter Bishop?

15:04.866 --> 15:07.234
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>his name.</i>

15:07.268 --> 15:10.287
He was older...

15:10.321 --> 15:13.073
grayish hair.

15:13.107 --> 15:15.959
<i>My mother assured him</i>
<i>that she would keep</i>

15:15.994 --> 15:20.581
a magnet packed up and ready
for when he came back for it.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.332
Before she died,

15:22.383 --> 15:25.786
<i>she made me promise</i>
<i>to keep the candle burning.</i>

15:31.893 --> 15:33.427
And I did.

15:37.465 --> 15:40.267
It wasn't always easy.

15:40.301 --> 15:42.135
At times,
we were destitute.

15:43.805 --> 15:48.275
There were people who wanted to
sell the magnet and the truck.

15:49.811 --> 15:51.311
They lost hope.

15:51.329 --> 15:53.781
But my mother never did.

15:53.815 --> 15:56.650
And neither did I.

15:56.668 --> 16:00.120
And here...

16:00.154 --> 16:02.456
Here you are.

16:04.659 --> 16:08.295
I sent for diesel fuel.
It's on its way.

16:08.329 --> 16:10.430
I know
you don't mind waiting,

16:10.465 --> 16:13.166
and you'd rather drive
after nightfall.

16:13.184 --> 16:16.470
How do you know that?

16:16.504 --> 16:21.308
I know a lot of things.

16:21.342 --> 16:24.611
I see flashes sometimes
when I'm around people.

16:24.646 --> 16:27.564
Like before,
when I met you,

16:27.615 --> 16:31.118
I saw that you have a bullet
in your pocket--

16:31.152 --> 16:34.988
<i>a slug.</i>

16:37.709 --> 16:41.361
I've always had a gift.

16:51.222 --> 16:53.974
Even with electricity coursing
through the neural tissue,

16:54.008 --> 16:56.310
the brain is dead...

16:56.344 --> 16:57.845
not quite human...

16:57.879 --> 17:02.182
Most likely damaged
by the preservation process.

17:02.216 --> 17:04.852
<i>But in order to understand</i>
<i>what's happening to Peter,</i>

17:04.886 --> 17:06.904
<i>we have to give this a shot.</i>

17:08.323 --> 17:11.023
The chances of this working...

17:12.410 --> 17:14.328
Are remote at best.

17:14.362 --> 17:16.980
Okay, I've got
a clear image.

17:21.068 --> 17:23.203
The question is...

17:23.237 --> 17:26.506
how do I attach...

17:28.626 --> 17:30.878
Oh.

17:30.912 --> 17:33.096
Oh, my.

17:33.131 --> 17:35.916
It worked.

17:37.302 --> 17:38.702
Whoa.

17:38.736 --> 17:40.737
This is a lot
of neural activity.

17:40.772 --> 17:43.423
I've never seen
anything like this.

17:45.193 --> 17:47.527
<i>It's all moving</i>
<i>along the cerebral cortex,</i>

17:47.562 --> 17:50.764
<i>which controls</i>
<i>higher-level thinking.</i>

17:56.287 --> 17:58.155
It stopped.

17:58.206 --> 17:59.923
<i>The device must've detected</i>

17:59.958 --> 18:01.742
<i>that the brain</i>
<i>isn't suitable.</i>

18:01.776 --> 18:04.077
Did we gather enough data
to extrapolate?

18:04.111 --> 18:05.712
Let's see.

18:05.747 --> 18:10.000
<i>Okay, if we take the process</i>
<i>that we just saw</i>

18:10.051 --> 18:11.501
and then we run it
continuously,

18:11.552 --> 18:13.937
what happens to the brain
over time is...

18:16.925 --> 18:20.310
<i>Walter, are those</i>
<i>new ridges forming?</i>

18:20.345 --> 18:23.296
Hmm.

18:23.314 --> 18:25.315
The more convolutions,

18:25.350 --> 18:28.118
the higher the brain function
in mammals.

18:28.152 --> 18:29.803
<i>Do you see that?</i>

18:29.821 --> 18:31.488
<i>Hmm.</i>

18:31.522 --> 18:34.725
<i>The cerebral cortex</i>
<i>is becoming so thick</i>

18:34.759 --> 18:37.761
that it's overriding the area
used to control emotions.

18:39.163 --> 18:42.332
<i>Remarkable.</i>

18:42.367 --> 18:44.818
Controlled evolution.

18:47.555 --> 18:51.625
It's worse than I feared.

18:53.428 --> 18:55.712
Where are they?

18:55.763 --> 18:57.297
They should be here by now.

18:57.331 --> 19:00.767
I wouldn't worry.
They'll be here soon.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.350
Hi.

19:17.368 --> 19:18.852
What's your name?

19:18.870 --> 19:21.655
Darby.

19:21.689 --> 19:23.657
I'm Olivia.

19:23.691 --> 19:24.858
I know.

19:24.876 --> 19:27.210
Everybody's talking
about you.

19:27.245 --> 19:29.162
Yeah?

19:29.196 --> 19:31.214
What are they saying?

19:32.750 --> 19:34.885
They said
you're on reward wire.

19:34.919 --> 19:37.537
There's a bounty on you.

19:37.555 --> 19:40.373
Really?

19:40.391 --> 19:41.641
What else did they say?

19:41.676 --> 19:44.044
<i>Darby?</i>

19:44.062 --> 19:46.212
I have to go.

19:50.818 --> 19:52.903
I thought
you might be thirsty.

19:52.937 --> 19:55.221
What's in it?

19:55.239 --> 19:56.723
Water.

19:56.741 --> 19:59.609
What's in the water...

19:59.660 --> 20:01.778
A sedative?

20:01.829 --> 20:04.865
You gonna knock me out?

20:04.899 --> 20:06.900
What are you talking about?

20:09.921 --> 20:13.256
Nobody's gone to get
diesel fuel, have they?

20:13.291 --> 20:15.759
You're wrong.

20:27.939 --> 20:31.058
Ahh.

20:35.813 --> 20:39.449
You have no faith.

20:42.036 --> 20:43.436
I could feel that
when you came--

20:43.454 --> 20:44.905
I'm done
with the parlor tricks.

20:44.939 --> 20:48.125
I want my truck
and my magnet now.

20:49.877 --> 20:53.580
When the fuel gets here,
you can have it...

20:53.614 --> 20:57.117
Unless, of course,
you'd like to leave now.

20:57.135 --> 20:59.302
Your car's over there.

20:59.337 --> 21:03.640
You can come back
with more people if you want.

21:03.674 --> 21:07.561
But we're still
gonna be here.

21:14.936 --> 21:17.154
You lost someone.

21:20.358 --> 21:22.993
That's an assumption that
you could make about anybody.

21:23.027 --> 21:26.496
But you lost
your daughter...

21:30.484 --> 21:32.485
Twice.

21:32.503 --> 21:34.771
<i>Fuel's here.</i>

22:12.076 --> 22:14.044
Did you think
you are the only one

22:14.078 --> 22:16.329
who can manipulate futures?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.551
I know that you have been making
adjustments to mine.

22:21.586 --> 22:25.005
I have been making
adjustments of my own.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.974
We know you switched
the briefcase.

22:29.477 --> 22:31.228
We traced it back
to the restaurant.

22:31.262 --> 22:34.648
And that gave us
an origin point for you.

22:34.682 --> 22:37.234
I knew you were
at the intersection

22:37.268 --> 22:40.553
when you caused me
to miss the light.

22:40.571 --> 22:43.840
The two events were
in close enough succession

22:43.875 --> 22:46.826
that I could determine
a probable future.

22:46.861 --> 22:50.280
I have led you here
to this place.

22:50.331 --> 22:54.901
Everything has taken place
as I intended.

23:09.717 --> 23:12.686
This was what she saw.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.523
This was her last thought
before she expired.

23:20.611 --> 23:23.947
Your emotions make you weak.

24:09.912 --> 24:13.331
I can understand
why your faith has been shaken.

24:13.365 --> 24:16.167
But there are mysteries
to the universe.

24:16.201 --> 24:17.969
My gift is evidence
of that.

24:18.003 --> 24:20.704
The fact that you are here
is evidence of that.

24:20.722 --> 24:23.057
Your rational mind
can't make sense

24:23.091 --> 24:24.392
of your loss.

24:24.426 --> 24:27.144
But your heart,
if you allow it to,

24:27.179 --> 24:30.765
will find its own
intuitive way.

24:30.816 --> 24:32.350
I'm getting
a strong feeling.

24:32.384 --> 24:34.819
Your daughter's
still with you...

24:36.238 --> 24:38.189
even now.

24:45.330 --> 24:48.165
Simone, you have a gift.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.084
You can see things
that other people can't.

24:50.118 --> 24:51.919
I don't doubt that.

24:51.954 --> 24:53.904
But...

24:53.922 --> 24:56.240
wherever you think
this gift came from

24:56.258 --> 24:59.410
or whoever you think
bestowed it upon you,

24:59.428 --> 25:02.913
it's simply an anomaly.

25:02.931 --> 25:07.518
I know that
because I'm an anomaly.

25:09.271 --> 25:13.107
I have moved things
with my mind.

25:13.141 --> 25:17.361
I've lit things on fire.
I've caught bullets midair.

25:17.396 --> 25:21.065
I've seen things that people
only dream about.

25:22.267 --> 25:24.101
I've seen...

25:24.119 --> 25:26.603
the seams between universes
ripped apart,

25:26.621 --> 25:29.790
things that humans
shouldn't see.

25:31.994 --> 25:36.213
People make up
explanations...

25:36.248 --> 25:40.167
assign meaning to things
without knowing,

25:40.218 --> 25:42.670
because it's reassuring.

25:42.721 --> 25:45.473
It's comforting.

25:45.507 --> 25:48.926
But I can't do that...

25:48.960 --> 25:51.645
Because I know too much.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.801
It's all just numbers.

25:57.819 --> 26:00.237
And the invaders,
as you call them,

26:00.272 --> 26:02.490
they're just better at math
than we are.

26:07.946 --> 26:11.665
Thank you
for the magnet.

26:22.544 --> 26:25.262
Why are you smiling?

26:27.499 --> 26:29.500
Because I believe.

26:29.518 --> 26:33.471
<i>You can't know</i>
<i>everything.</i>

26:59.498 --> 27:01.549
More heat, Asner.

27:03.802 --> 27:06.887
I said "more heat,"
not shut it.

27:10.926 --> 27:12.510
Peter.

27:14.179 --> 27:18.899
I need you to suture
my shoulder, Walter.

27:21.219 --> 27:23.354
I need my medical kit,
disinfectant,

27:23.388 --> 27:25.239
and pain medication.

27:25.824 --> 27:27.691
Got it.

27:27.725 --> 27:29.827
How badly does it hurt?

27:29.861 --> 27:32.997
There is no pain.

27:35.867 --> 27:39.253
I've discovered
things, Peter...

27:39.287 --> 27:43.207
things you need to know.

27:43.241 --> 27:47.294
I've run
a diagnostic simulation.

27:47.345 --> 27:49.880
The technology you've put
inside yourself

27:49.914 --> 27:52.716
is in the process of...

27:52.750 --> 27:56.137
completely reshaping
your brain.

27:56.188 --> 28:00.524
The areas that relate
to emotion...

28:00.559 --> 28:02.776
are being commandeered
to make room

28:02.811 --> 28:04.528
for more logical thought.

28:04.563 --> 28:09.033
Shrinking the nucleus accumbens
in my limbic system,

28:09.067 --> 28:10.618
suppressing
emotional memory

28:10.652 --> 28:12.536
in favor
of higher rational thought,

28:12.571 --> 28:15.956
also expanding
my cerebral cortex.

28:15.991 --> 28:19.243
I know.

28:19.277 --> 28:24.114
If you could see
what I see, Walter...

28:24.132 --> 28:27.384
If you could experience
what it feels like

28:27.419 --> 28:30.554
to fully harness the untapped
potential of the human brain,

28:30.589 --> 28:34.791
you, of all people,
should know

28:34.809 --> 28:38.479
that there is no reason
to be afraid.

28:46.021 --> 28:47.404
Are you also aware

28:47.439 --> 28:49.640
that the changes
will soon be permanent?

28:49.658 --> 28:51.909
And if that happens,

28:51.943 --> 28:55.196
there's nothing I can do
to get you back.

28:55.247 --> 28:57.915
I'm going to do this.

28:59.784 --> 29:02.086
I'm going to shift
Windmark's future

29:02.120 --> 29:03.704
so that he passes
through the square

29:03.755 --> 29:06.090
at exactly 7:19 p.m.

29:06.124 --> 29:08.626
When he does, I will know
that he has been reset

29:08.660 --> 29:10.611
onto the correct path.

29:12.047 --> 29:14.848
I can't allow you
to make that mistake.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.850
Don't you see, Walter?

29:16.885 --> 29:19.136
When he passes
through the square,

29:19.170 --> 29:22.473
she will be avenged.

29:26.978 --> 29:30.180
We all want Windmark dead...

29:32.984 --> 29:37.705
But the plan outlined on
the tapes is the way to do it.

29:40.208 --> 29:44.027
We need you, son.

29:44.045 --> 29:47.715
I need you.

29:49.517 --> 29:53.304
I have to go.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.067
<i>Olivia.</i>

30:07.102 --> 30:09.820
<i>I got a truck and a magnet.</i>

30:09.854 --> 30:12.072
I need someplace big enough
to store them.

30:12.107 --> 30:14.325
<i>We've got a warehouse</i>
<i>outside the city.</i>

30:14.359 --> 30:15.859
When you're close,

30:15.893 --> 30:18.996
I'll have someone meet you
and guide you there.

30:19.030 --> 30:21.915
Hey, listen,
I'm gonna call you back.

30:45.991 --> 30:48.025
Hey! Don't move!
Hands up!

30:54.115 --> 30:55.482
What do you got
in the truck?

30:55.533 --> 30:57.618
Nothing that you'd be
interested in.

30:57.652 --> 30:58.902
Got any money?

30:58.936 --> 31:00.704
Nope.

31:14.285 --> 31:18.222
You don't need money.
You are money.

31:35.125 --> 31:36.759
<i>I'm just saying...</i>

31:36.793 --> 31:38.144
<i>with the money</i>
<i>we'll make from the truck</i>

31:38.732 --> 31:40.566
<i>and the scraps</i>
<i>from the magnet,</i>

31:40.617 --> 31:42.068
<i>it's a pretty good score.</i>

31:42.419 --> 31:44.120
Are you sure you want
to get involved in this?

31:44.154 --> 31:47.256
We could pull 100 more jobs
and not see this kind of money.

31:47.290 --> 31:49.508
<i>Now give me your comm.</i>

31:51.344 --> 31:54.630
Trust me, all right?
I've got it covered.

32:11.448 --> 32:13.149
<i>Reward wire.</i>

32:13.183 --> 32:14.650
<i>Do you have something</i>
<i>to report?</i>

32:14.684 --> 32:16.235
I have a fugitive in custody.

32:16.286 --> 32:18.154
<i>What is your location?</i>

32:18.188 --> 32:19.855
I don't want to tell you
where I am.

32:19.873 --> 32:21.407
I want to meet
at a Truth church.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.659
<i>This is unorthodox.</i>

32:23.693 --> 32:25.711
Yeah, well, I've done things
I don't want to be read for.

32:25.745 --> 32:27.746
So the only way this goes down
is at a Truth church,

32:27.798 --> 32:29.531
where you can't scan me.

32:29.549 --> 32:31.667
Once I get the money,
I'll tell you where she is.

32:31.701 --> 32:33.869
<i>What is the fugitive's name?</i>

32:33.887 --> 32:35.871
Olivia Dunham.

32:35.889 --> 32:38.174
<i>Hold, please.</i>

32:58.578 --> 33:00.229
<i>Reward wire call--</i>

33:00.247 --> 33:03.065
<i>a man claims to have</i>
<i>Olivia Dunham in custody.</i>

33:03.083 --> 33:05.451
He wants the reward
for her capture up front.

33:07.671 --> 33:09.622
Acceptable.

33:09.673 --> 33:13.092
<i>What is the closest</i>
<i>Truth church to your location?</i>

33:13.126 --> 33:15.878
There's one in Sector Seven.
I can be there in an hour.

33:15.912 --> 33:18.881
<i>See that you are.</i>

33:22.085 --> 33:23.636
And that's how we roll.

33:23.687 --> 33:25.855
Huh?

33:27.724 --> 33:30.943
Come on.
You used to be fun.

35:45.161 --> 35:46.695
What the hell is this?

36:00.210 --> 36:02.378
Don't.

36:02.412 --> 36:04.296
Put your hands
on your head.

36:04.347 --> 36:06.098
Where's Briggs?

36:37.196 --> 36:39.113
<i>Olivia, where are you?</i>

36:39.148 --> 36:40.615
I'm on my way back to Boston.

36:40.649 --> 36:42.183
<i>I've got the magnet.</i>

36:42.201 --> 36:43.951
<i>Anil's got a place</i>
<i>where we can store it.</i>

36:43.986 --> 36:45.736
What happened
to your face?

36:45.788 --> 36:47.705
I'm a little banged up,
but I'm okay, Walter.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.491
Um, Olivia,
Peter was here.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.712
When?
<i>A couple of hours ago.</i>

36:54.746 --> 36:56.831
I tried to convince him.

36:56.865 --> 36:59.033
I said that his brain
is being altered,

36:59.051 --> 37:01.169
and that soon
it will be irreversible.

37:01.203 --> 37:02.637
<i>But he won't hear me.</i>

37:02.671 --> 37:04.972
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what else to do.</i>

37:07.926 --> 37:12.379
Walter, do you know
where he is?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.749
<i>Peter.</i>

37:32.734 --> 37:36.003
Olivia.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.341
Walter, told me
about Windmark...

37:40.375 --> 37:43.911
That he almost
killed you.

37:45.848 --> 37:50.768
I have already turned that
to my advantage.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.354
See those steps down there?

37:53.388 --> 37:57.191
In a few minutes, if everything
goes according to plan,

37:57.226 --> 37:58.809
Windmark will walk up
those steps

37:58.861 --> 38:00.027
and pass that fountain.

38:00.062 --> 38:01.796
Then I will know
that he has been reset

38:01.830 --> 38:04.148
onto the correct path.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.201
He does not realize it now,

38:07.236 --> 38:09.937
but he will be back on the
trajectory that I want him on.

38:09.955 --> 38:13.241
What trajectory is that?

38:13.275 --> 38:15.743
The trajectory
that leads to his death.

38:19.281 --> 38:22.116
He killed our daughter.

38:24.670 --> 38:28.122
At exactly 5:12
tomorrow afternoon,

38:28.140 --> 38:30.457
I will meet him
face-to-face.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.810
He will not expect it.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.763
He will not have a chance
to fight back.

38:35.797 --> 38:39.150
At 5:13,
I will snap his neck.

38:39.184 --> 38:42.436
At 5:14, he will draw
his last breath.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.775
Peter, I've lost you before
over this,

38:47.809 --> 38:50.244
and I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

38:50.279 --> 38:53.414
Now, your thinking is way ahead
of mine--I understand that.

38:53.448 --> 38:57.034
But the fact that I am here has
got nothing to do with anything

38:57.085 --> 38:59.787
except feeling.

38:59.821 --> 39:01.956
And soon, you're not gonna
be able to feel anything,

39:01.990 --> 39:04.258
not for me,
not for Etta.

39:10.933 --> 39:14.769
When I was fighting
Windmark,

39:14.803 --> 39:17.338
he showed me
Etta's last thoughts

39:17.356 --> 39:20.808
before he shot her.

39:25.147 --> 39:28.482
She thought of us...

39:28.516 --> 39:32.519
that day in the park
before they invaded,

39:32.537 --> 39:34.705
before everything
went wrong.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.959
Her last thoughts...

39:37.993 --> 39:41.128
They were of us.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.089
I will kill him tomorrow.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.042
If I remove the tech,
I will not be able to do that.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.510
Don't you see?

39:59.398 --> 40:01.565
And what if tomorrow
is too late?

40:01.600 --> 40:05.052
What if that tech
becomes permanent?

40:07.439 --> 40:10.825
Etta's not gone, Peter.
Windmark didn't take her.

40:10.859 --> 40:14.111
Yes, he did.
No, he didn't.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.562
She's still here with us.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.865
She is dead.

40:17.899 --> 40:20.918
She saved my life today

40:20.952 --> 40:23.371
with the bullet
she brought to us.

40:23.405 --> 40:25.039
She's alive inside us.

40:25.073 --> 40:27.041
And there's nothing
that Windmark can do about it,

40:27.075 --> 40:29.927
because the love
that we can share with her now

40:29.961 --> 40:32.046
is invulnerable
to space and time,

40:32.080 --> 40:34.915
even to them.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.351
And I know that our hearts
are broken and that it hurts,

40:37.386 --> 40:41.055
but that's
what makes us human.

40:42.757 --> 40:44.525
Emotion is our weakness.

40:44.559 --> 40:47.094
No, Peter,
it's our strength,

40:47.112 --> 40:50.081
because it's the one thing
that they don't have.

40:50.115 --> 40:53.451
Now, we need to hold on
to our connection with Etta,

40:53.485 --> 40:55.736
feeling what we felt
for her,

40:55.770 --> 40:58.605
or she dies all over again.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.625
And we cannot let her
be erased.

41:05.630 --> 41:06.747
Peter--

41:06.781 --> 41:08.949
<i>Peter, I'm not asking you</i>
<i>to abandon her.</i>

41:08.967 --> 41:11.285
I'm asking you
to hold on to her.

41:13.588 --> 41:16.640
<i>You're not one of them.</i>
<i>You're one of us.</i>

41:20.679 --> 41:23.597
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to listen to me.</i>

41:24.649 --> 41:27.268
I'm not gonna
lose you again.

41:36.495 --> 41:39.747
Peter...
look at me.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.986
I love you.

43:11.673 --> 43:14.091
I love you.
