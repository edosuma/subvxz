WEBVTT

00:00.989 --> 00:02.980
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:03.058 --> 00:04.582
<i>I can make this whole thing go away.</i>

00:04.659 --> 00:05.853
<i>And what's it going to cost me?</i>

00:05.927 --> 00:08.054
<i>I'll convince her
to split her shares,</i>

00:08.129 --> 00:12.065
sign over half to Daniel, half to you.
You'll both be Editors-in-Chief.

00:12.434 --> 00:14.402
Whatever happens with you
and your wife,

00:14.436 --> 00:16.961
I can't be responsible for it.

00:17.005 --> 00:19.235
- They can't just take your son!
He's not my son!

00:19.274 --> 00:20.901
But I want you to be my father!

00:20.942 --> 00:24.274
Maybe I can be your really cool
American uncle.

00:24.311 --> 00:27.109
<i>That's Kimmie Keegan.
She tortured me in high school.</i>

00:27.147 --> 00:28.171
That's your daughter?

00:28.215 --> 00:29.273
I don't hate you.

00:29.316 --> 00:31.181
I just feel
like nothing's ever gonna change.

00:31.218 --> 00:34.016
Well, you just have
to be willing to do something about it.

00:41.595 --> 00:43.085
Can we get more smoke in here?

00:43.163 --> 00:45.131
Look up! Look up, everybody!
We need to see some faces!

00:45.165 --> 00:46.564
All right, I'm not loving this.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.897
But you promised Zac Posen.

00:47.935 --> 00:51.496
I know, I'll give him a couple pages
in front of book. One bayonet, please.

00:51.538 --> 00:54.632
And I'm worried about shadows.
Gotta lose the helmet.

00:54.675 --> 00:56.040
Okay.

00:59.079 --> 01:00.205
Great.

01:01.215 --> 01:02.842
I'll go disarm.

01:06.653 --> 01:09.654
Oh, Mrs. Meade!
I've been meaning to talk to you,

01:09.689 --> 01:12.817
but with all the craziness of doing
these photo shoots Daniel's way,

01:12.892 --> 01:15.224
and then redoing them Wilhelmina's
way, and then going back to...

01:15.261 --> 01:18.560
- Betty, I get the pattern.
- Well...

01:20.466 --> 01:24.129
Has Daniel said anything to you
about DJ being gone?

01:24.804 --> 01:26.738
- Not a word.
- Me neither.

01:26.773 --> 01:27.797
I'm worried about him.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.004
He's focusing all his energy on work.
He's totally avoiding his feelings.

01:32.045 --> 01:34.172
Well, on the spectrum
of our family's vices,

01:34.213 --> 01:36.773
work is a lot healthier than murder.

01:37.283 --> 01:39.877
Hmm. That's true.

01:39.919 --> 01:44.618
Betty, you have a lot on your plate.
Let me take care of Daniel.

01:45.558 --> 01:47.492
All right. Thanks, guys.

01:49.928 --> 01:53.227
Puppy! Where did you come from?

01:55.133 --> 01:57.158
What the hell is this?

01:57.769 --> 01:59.100
"Love is a Battlefield. "

01:59.137 --> 02:01.628
It's the center spread
for our Valentine's issue.

02:01.673 --> 02:03.834
I thought we were doing
"Puppy Love. "

02:03.875 --> 02:07.538
No, you were doing "Puppy Love. "
I didn't like it. Go ahead, we can start.

02:07.579 --> 02:10.479
Because nothing says
romance like missing limbs.

02:10.514 --> 02:12.176
I'm on with the PETA people
about the coat.

02:12.217 --> 02:14.344
They're in an uproar
because you're wearing Dalmatian.

02:14.386 --> 02:16.820
Oh. For God's sake, it's not real dog.

02:16.855 --> 02:19.619
- It's rare albino leopard.
- It's rare albino leopard.

02:19.658 --> 02:22.126
Get the kids and the puppies
and lose those soldiers.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.856
No. I'm not letting you walk all over me.

02:24.896 --> 02:27.558
This is the shoot I want to do.
Kill the puppies.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.328
Did you hear that?
Daniel Meade kills puppies!

02:31.369 --> 02:34.030
Wilhelmina Slater
does not support our troops!

02:34.071 --> 02:36.562
And here comes
the Editor-in-Chief argument.

02:36.607 --> 02:39.838
In case you've forgotten, I am
the Editor-in-Chief of this magazine.

02:39.877 --> 02:42.437
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the Editor-in-Chief, too.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.573
- Daniel! Every time!
- I'm not gonna do this with you.

02:44.615 --> 02:46.606
- For 20 years, I've worked on...
- I want you to leave my set.

02:46.650 --> 02:48.049
- I've brought this magazine...
- This is my set...

02:48.152 --> 02:54.148
Okay, I am not the Editor-in-Chief of
this magazine, but this is a disaster.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.568 --> 03:06.058
This is about setting precedent.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.436
Alexis is gone. Wilhelmina and I
share power 50-50 now.

03:09.473 --> 03:13.432
Okay, Daniel, but Wilhelmina is not
going to budge and neither are you,

03:13.477 --> 03:15.570
which means we have to do
everything twice,

03:15.613 --> 03:18.308
but nothing is actually getting done.

03:18.348 --> 03:23.183
And, look, I hate to complain, but this
is just more work than I can handle.

03:23.253 --> 03:25.414
So, what, I should roll over
to make your life easier?

03:25.488 --> 03:28.013
No, and I'm not loving the attitude,
by the way.

03:28.091 --> 03:31.527
I'm just saying
something has to change.

03:32.829 --> 03:34.057
Well...

03:34.697 --> 03:37.359
- I'm bored.
- I'm in a rush.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.301
See, this is a perfectly hideous outfit
you're wearing,

03:40.336 --> 03:41.667
but I've already mocked it.

03:41.704 --> 03:43.763
Where am I supposed
to find job satisfaction?

03:43.807 --> 03:45.741
I don't know. Maybe your job?

03:45.775 --> 03:48.266
There's something at your desk.

03:49.779 --> 03:50.939
Um...

03:51.414 --> 03:52.642
Hello?

03:53.016 --> 03:55.883
Betty, thank God you're here!

03:56.386 --> 03:57.683
Kimmie?

03:57.754 --> 03:59.277
I really need your help.

03:59.354 --> 04:00.753
Remember when you came
to Flushing Burger

04:00.823 --> 04:02.415
and gave me that speech
about how I could do better?

04:02.491 --> 04:03.515
Uh-huh.

04:03.592 --> 04:06.186
Well, turns out, I can't.

04:06.228 --> 04:08.628
I quit my job
and no one wants to hire me.

04:08.664 --> 04:12.361
My boyfriend that I hate, he cheated
on me with my ex-step-sister,

04:12.401 --> 04:14.266
and I'm having pains in my large joints.

04:14.303 --> 04:17.636
I mean, do you think
my Lyme disease is coming back?

04:17.673 --> 04:19.903
I... I don't know.

04:21.476 --> 04:25.071
Look, I would love to blame this
all on you, really I would,

04:25.113 --> 04:28.014
but truth is, my life has been
a downhill slide into sucks

04:28.083 --> 04:29.914
since high school. I mean, back then,

04:29.985 --> 04:32.510
people would applaud for me
when I walked into a room, Betty.

04:32.588 --> 04:35.056
And what if that
doesn't happen anymore?

04:35.123 --> 04:37.023
You get used to it.

04:37.759 --> 04:41.559
The thing is, you seem
to have everything so together.

04:41.597 --> 04:44.690
And I thought maybe
you could help me turn things around

04:44.732 --> 04:46.757
by getting me a job here.

04:51.205 --> 04:57.667
Gosh. Kimmie, I would really,
really like to help you, it's just,

04:57.712 --> 05:01.443
you know, there aren't really
any openings here and... Sorry.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.483
Betty, you know, I was thinking
about what you said earlier.

05:03.551 --> 05:04.711
Things really are crazy here.

05:04.785 --> 05:05.979
Why don't you get a temp
to help you out?

05:06.053 --> 05:08.351
- That's not necessary!
- Oh, my God, hi!

05:08.389 --> 05:09.583
I'm Betty's friend from high school,

05:09.624 --> 05:12.457
and we were just talking about
how I should maybe work here.

05:12.493 --> 05:15.155
<i>- No!
- Perfect timing. Welcome to Mode.</i>

05:16.297 --> 05:18.060
- Yes!
- Yes!

05:21.936 --> 05:23.028
Yay.

05:23.738 --> 05:25.137
I'm in hell.

05:25.972 --> 05:29.430
Is she really that bad?
- You have no idea.

05:29.476 --> 05:32.343
When we were in junior high,
she had the entire student body

05:32.379 --> 05:33.710
calling me "Pig Latin. "

05:34.881 --> 05:36.109
Hey!

05:36.182 --> 05:37.581
Come on,
I've had an awful lot of trauma.

05:37.617 --> 05:39.346
For God's sake, let me have my laugh.

05:39.419 --> 05:40.579
How is Stuart anyway?

05:40.654 --> 05:43.623
Oh, perfectly fine until he doesn't want
to do the dishes or the washing,

05:43.690 --> 05:46.818
and then it's all, "I'm dying, I'm dying. "

05:46.860 --> 05:48.088
Christina!

05:49.195 --> 05:51.993
We've decided to act
like everything's normal.

05:52.699 --> 05:55.259
It's the only way to not go crazy.

05:55.869 --> 05:59.236
So, come on, finish telling me
about the hateful hellion.

05:59.272 --> 06:02.332
Well, I finally make it
to high school.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.536
It's my chance at a fresh start,

06:04.577 --> 06:06.841
<i>but Kimmie is there, too.</i>

06:12.584 --> 06:14.381
Hi, Kimmie.

06:14.420 --> 06:17.082
I was thinking
since we're both new here

06:17.122 --> 06:22.389
and we don't know anyone else,
maybe we could sit together.

06:24.263 --> 06:26.424
- Fine.
- Really?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.430
Oh, my God, okay, great!

06:31.904 --> 06:36.102
Wait, since you're up already,
would you mind getting me a water?

06:36.141 --> 06:38.302
Of course. No problem-o!

06:49.488 --> 06:51.786
- You've got something on your skirt.
- Hmm?

06:51.824 --> 06:54.348
You've got something
on your skirt.

07:06.804 --> 07:11.241
<i>And that's why for four years,
they called me "Granny Pants. "</i>

07:12.243 --> 07:16.373
<i>Christina, I have worked too hard
just to get the people at Mode</i>

07:16.447 --> 07:20.406
to almost not hate me.
I don't want her to ruin that.

07:20.485 --> 07:22.282
I know,
but you've got all the power now,

07:22.320 --> 07:25.255
and now it's your turn
to make her life a misery.

07:25.289 --> 07:27.587
I don't know about that.

07:27.625 --> 07:30.992
It's called karma, Granny Pants.

07:31.029 --> 07:33.896
Yeah, okay, let's not make that a thing.

07:36.033 --> 07:37.660
That was a secret.

07:37.701 --> 07:41.569
So, apparently, another Billy Elliot's
voice started to change,

07:41.605 --> 07:43.573
and they're casting for three new kids.

07:43.607 --> 07:45.905
Mrs. Read's gonna recommend me
for the audition.

07:45.942 --> 07:48.944
<i>Wait, you're auditioning
for Billy Elliot on Broadway?</i>

07:48.979 --> 07:52.540
Yeah! I mean, a blue-collar British kid
from a coal-mining town

07:52.616 --> 07:55.210
with a flair for dance,
it's like it was written for me!

07:55.285 --> 07:58.015
She's gonna call me tonight
and let me know.

07:58.155 --> 07:59.452
Oops.

07:59.723 --> 08:01.020
Loser.

08:02.159 --> 08:03.353
Too easy.

08:03.393 --> 08:05.884
I'm sure this happened to Patti LuPone.

08:05.929 --> 08:07.294
He's just a stupid jock.

08:08.665 --> 08:11.133
Daniel was adamant.
He wants the one on the left.

08:11.168 --> 08:13.261
But they're exactly the same.

08:13.303 --> 08:17.399
No, Wilhelmina wants the one
on the right. Welcome to my world.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.340
I got most of your receipts,
but Wilmemina wasn't in her office.

08:22.411 --> 08:23.901
Great.

08:23.979 --> 08:25.469
There she is!

08:25.548 --> 08:27.482
You really shouldn't...

08:28.918 --> 08:31.751
It's your turn to make her life a misery.

08:33.522 --> 08:36.548
...wait too long. We really need them.

08:40.261 --> 08:43.288
Hey, Wilmemina,
I have to get your receipts.

08:43.332 --> 08:45.232
Oh, my God, I have that same jacket.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.827
Except I got mine at a discount store
for 60% off,

08:47.870 --> 08:50.703
and you can't even see
the hole under the armpit.

08:50.739 --> 08:51.865
Marc!

08:54.376 --> 08:55.536
Scat!

08:57.646 --> 09:01.877
"Wilmemina"? "60%
off"? Why is she even talking to me?

09:01.916 --> 09:06.410
I know it's mean,
but it kind of felt good.

09:06.454 --> 09:09.048
That bitch got what she deserved!

09:09.090 --> 09:11.183
And if the tables were turned,

09:11.226 --> 09:13.888
she would've done something
way worse to me.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.728
Tie that skank to a lamppost
and let her rot!

09:20.502 --> 09:22.629
Okay, what's going on with you?

09:22.670 --> 09:26.436
I'm trying not to be sad about Coach,
so I'm choosing anger.

09:27.308 --> 09:28.866
It's a great release.

09:31.012 --> 09:33.537
Yeah, she's been a delight.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.312
You know, have you ever thought
about helping Kimmie out?

09:38.153 --> 09:39.848
Dad, how could you say that?

09:39.888 --> 09:42.516
She was terrible to you
at Flushing Burger.

09:42.557 --> 09:45.525
I would totally get revenge
on my bullies if I could.

09:45.559 --> 09:49.290
Wait a minute. You have bullies?
Why didn't I know about this?

09:49.329 --> 09:51.991
- It's nothing.
- Well, it's gonna be something

09:52.032 --> 09:53.727
when I go down there
and I kick their asses!

09:53.767 --> 09:55.928
We're talking about Betty! Betty.

09:55.969 --> 09:58.437
I don't understand
why I have to be the bigger person.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.872
<i>I mean, when I started at Mode,
no one helped me.</i>

10:00.908 --> 10:02.705
And did you like it?

10:03.610 --> 10:07.706
No, but I dealt with it,
because that is a part of growing up.

10:07.781 --> 10:08.839
What!

10:08.916 --> 10:12.852
So is putting the past behind you.
If you give Kimmie a chance,

10:12.886 --> 10:16.378
maybe you'll find
you're not as different as you think.

10:18.892 --> 10:22.521
What if we accidentally shaved
half of Betty's head while she slept?

10:22.563 --> 10:23.621
That'd be something new to mock.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.063
It's funny,
but it seems like a lot of work.

10:25.098 --> 10:27.089
Yeah, and she might
actually look better.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.734
Temp.

10:30.770 --> 10:33.967
Oh, my God, it's an achy breaky tart.

10:36.042 --> 10:37.669
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:37.743 --> 10:40.211
Cute tiny backpack.

10:40.246 --> 10:42.510
Do you put
all your tiny scrunchies in it?

10:42.548 --> 10:43.572
I do.

10:43.649 --> 10:46.743
It's so dope. Not '90s at all.

10:46.786 --> 10:48.879
Great, because I was worried,
you know,

10:48.921 --> 10:50.320
I haven't bought new clothes
since high school,

10:50.356 --> 10:52.881
and my old job,
we used to have uniforms...

10:52.925 --> 10:54.688
N.I.

10:57.930 --> 10:59.557
I love my job.

11:00.499 --> 11:03.696
Okay, people,
we still don't have a center spread.

11:03.736 --> 11:04.930
We have a lot of work coming up.

11:09.342 --> 11:10.502
Sorry!

11:12.844 --> 11:16.610
Kimmie, why don't you go
get some waters for the room?

11:16.648 --> 11:17.808
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:17.849 --> 11:22.183
Wow, throw a poncho and sideburns
on that girl, she could be you, Betty.

11:22.220 --> 11:26.486
Well, for our first new order
of business, fire that train wreck.

11:36.034 --> 11:37.968
Okay, stop!

11:38.003 --> 11:42.963
Look, sometimes when people
walk in here, they get nervous,

11:43.041 --> 11:45.976
and they don't do so well
on their first day.

11:46.011 --> 11:48.536
Or maybe they make
regrettable wardrobe decisions

11:48.613 --> 11:50.513
that they can never live down.

11:50.548 --> 11:51.776
Betty, I know she's your friend,

11:51.816 --> 11:53.750
but you're the one
who's gonna have to pick up the slack

11:53.785 --> 11:54.842
if she can't cut it.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.785
Well, it won't happen.

11:58.989 --> 12:01.514
I'm gonna turn her
into the perfect assistant.

12:23.047 --> 12:26.983
<i>Working at Mode is intimidating,
so I've created an acronym</i>

12:27.017 --> 12:29.645
to help you remember
the three most important things.

12:29.687 --> 12:31.917
A- R-G. ARG. Let's start with "A."

12:31.955 --> 12:34.583
Anticipate. Know what
people need before they do.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.219
- But how do you know what they...
- I anticipated you were gonna ask that.

12:37.261 --> 12:38.591
- Wow. You're good.
- I know.

12:38.628 --> 12:40.118
Then there's "R." Research.

12:40.163 --> 12:42.757
Read everything, listen to everything,
know everything.

12:42.799 --> 12:44.027
- Everything?
- Did I not just say

12:44.067 --> 12:45.261
"everything" three times?

12:45.301 --> 12:47.565
For example, yesterday,
you needed to know

12:47.637 --> 12:50.162
that if you need Wilhelmina's receipts,
you never ask her for them.

12:50.239 --> 12:51.399
But you told me to.

12:51.474 --> 12:53.772
Another lesson,
be careful who you listen to.

12:53.810 --> 12:55.801
But back to Wilhelmina,
avoidance is key.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.869
If you screw up with her, you're fired,

12:57.947 --> 12:59.778
or you could die.
There have been rumors.

12:59.816 --> 13:01.841
If you need something,
this is what you do.

13:01.884 --> 13:03.943
"Wow, it's too bad
Daniel can't go to the premiere

13:03.986 --> 13:05.578
"for that new Colin Farrell movie. "

13:05.621 --> 13:07.145
Colin Farrell?

13:07.190 --> 13:09.988
Oh, that's right,
Amanda mentioned you liked him.

13:10.026 --> 13:11.653
- What do you want?
- Wilhelmina's September receipts.

13:11.694 --> 13:13.127
- Do I get a guest?
- If you promise me October.

13:13.162 --> 13:16.188
- All right, on your desk in an hour.
- And that's "G." Gumption.

13:16.232 --> 13:17.494
Wow. This is harder than I thought.

13:17.533 --> 13:20.195
Well, take a deep breath,
because we're just getting started.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.138
Oh, God!

13:25.941 --> 13:28.375
Try again. Wilhelmina.

13:28.410 --> 13:29.900
Wilmemina.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.143
Wilhelmina.

13:33.382 --> 13:34.406
Wilmemina.

13:41.056 --> 13:43.957
Okay, take it by the handle,
and press that button.

13:45.127 --> 13:47.425
Wilhelmina.

13:47.829 --> 13:49.296
Wilmelmina.

13:49.331 --> 13:53.461
Okay, there's an easy way
to remember this, there's "hell" in it.

13:53.502 --> 13:54.867
Hellmemina!

13:54.903 --> 13:56.495
What is wrong with you?

13:56.571 --> 13:58.402
Maybe this was a big mistake.

13:58.473 --> 14:01.636
No, no, no, it's not a big mistake.

14:01.676 --> 14:06.942
Look, I know that these past couple of
years have been really rough on you,

14:06.981 --> 14:10.382
but you're Kimmie Keegan!

14:10.418 --> 14:14.445
You were homecoming queen
and prom queen

14:14.488 --> 14:18.982
and president of the senior class
and a cheerleader.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.621
- Head cheerleader.
- Head cheerleader. See?

14:22.663 --> 14:27.123
Now, you've just got to find that
confidence that you had in high school.

14:28.569 --> 14:30.833
Two, four, six, eight.

14:33.007 --> 14:35.271
Kimmie Keegan used to be great?

14:35.309 --> 14:36.333
That's a start!

14:37.311 --> 14:39.472
You are really stepping up.

14:40.948 --> 14:44.679
That look on
Wilhelmina's stretched face

14:44.718 --> 14:48.016
when you refused to give in
to her shoot was priceless.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.318
Since when do you eat kid cereal?

14:50.356 --> 14:53.621
DJ turned me onto it.
It turns the milk blue.

14:56.696 --> 15:00.291
I also found some of DJ's things
around the house.

15:00.366 --> 15:07.033
Baseball cards, lingerie catalog
and something called

15:07.073 --> 15:10.042
<i>"Street Wars Five:
Revenge of the Pimps. "</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:12.044
Actually, that's mine.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.814
I know what you're trying to do.
I don't want to talk about it.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.819
I'm just having
my morning bowl of marshmallows.

15:23.857 --> 15:27.520
What do you want me to say?
I miss him?

15:27.560 --> 15:31.495
When he was here,
I had more balance?

15:33.565 --> 15:37.126
Just like the stupid things
didn't matter anymore.

15:37.202 --> 15:41.002
Now all I have are the stupid things.
I just... I...

15:42.741 --> 15:45.801
- You just what?
- I want a family, Mom.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.310
That's wonderful.

15:49.982 --> 15:54.248
I guess.
But what am I supposed to do about it?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.982
The women I've been meeting
aren't exactly life-mates.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.286
I mean, my clock is ticking.

16:01.059 --> 16:05.428
Your father conceived a child
after he was dead. You'll be fine.

16:19.043 --> 16:20.442
- Very good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:20.478 --> 16:22.378
It's good,
but you're still popping your hip.

16:22.413 --> 16:25.541
<i>- Hilda.
- I saw A Chorus Line, okay?</i>

16:26.217 --> 16:30.620
Okay, Mom.
Mom, I'm going to get some water.

16:30.655 --> 16:32.623
Okay, but don't think that means

16:32.657 --> 16:35.125
you get an automatic bathroom break
in an hour.

16:35.159 --> 16:37.093
You're riding him pretty hard,
don't you think?

16:37.128 --> 16:39.426
Maybe it's time for you to be done
with the anger phase.

16:39.463 --> 16:44.628
No, no, no, it's not anger.
It's just, I really want him to get this.

16:44.702 --> 16:46.363
He's having a hard time
at school lately.

16:46.437 --> 16:47.461
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:47.538 --> 16:49.597
You heard him talking
about the bullies.

16:49.674 --> 16:52.040
Yeah, but I didn't think it was serious.

16:52.076 --> 16:56.638
He downplays it, but I just want him
to have a place where he fits in.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.140
Okay, I'm ready.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.946
- From the top!
- Five, six, seven, eight.

17:06.423 --> 17:09.790
Hey. So, I noticed Daniel's cuticles
were a little rough.

17:09.826 --> 17:11.953
I heard the beauty editor
talking about this new spa

17:11.994 --> 17:14.463
where they soak your fingers
in organic olive oil.

17:14.497 --> 17:16.089
They told me no openings till March.

17:16.165 --> 17:21.001
<i>I told them no "Editor's Pick" in Mode.
Daniel has an appointment for Friday.</i>

17:21.570 --> 17:27.839
Wow. Well, you anticipated,
did research and showed gumption.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.572
- ARG!
- ARG!

17:29.613 --> 17:32.878
You've been so amazing to me.
I have to find a way to thank you.

17:32.916 --> 17:34.008
It's not necessary.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.950
- Let's go out tonight.
- Really?

17:35.986 --> 17:39.717
I was updating Daniel's contacts,
and I got us into all the hot clubs.

17:39.756 --> 17:40.949
I've tried to get in before,

17:40.990 --> 17:43.356
but it's like they could smell
the bridge and tunnel on me.

17:43.392 --> 17:47.658
But tonight, you and me are VIP.
I'm so glad we're becoming friends.

17:50.466 --> 17:51.899
Me, too.

17:55.037 --> 17:57.369
Could you proof this?
- Sure.

17:59.108 --> 18:01.838
Is this an application
for a dating service?

18:01.877 --> 18:05.108
Actually, it's a discreet,
high-end matchmaking organization.

18:05.147 --> 18:08.310
I thought it's time
I got serious about meeting someone,

18:08.350 --> 18:11.842
and since the last woman I picked
ended up burning my house down,

18:11.887 --> 18:13.718
I thought I'd trust the professionals.

18:13.756 --> 18:17.954
That's wonderful.
Okay, you are not this tall.

18:17.993 --> 18:20.894
Well, it depends on the shoe.
Keep reading.

18:20.929 --> 18:25.524
"Likes: sports, mmm-hmm,
women, mmm-hmm, yoga"?

18:26.167 --> 18:28.067
Yeah, I took a class.

18:28.736 --> 18:33.036
Right. "... walks at sunset and myself. "

18:33.074 --> 18:35.872
Well, I thought
it shows healthy self-esteem.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.879
Why don't I just take
a quick pass at this?

18:39.080 --> 18:41.878
Oh, oh. By the way, do you think
we're gonna be working late tonight?

18:41.916 --> 18:43.884
- Probably not.
- Good.

18:45.853 --> 18:48.413
Don't you want to know what I'm doing?

18:48.456 --> 18:49.548
What are you doing, Betty?

18:49.590 --> 18:51.114
I'm going clubbing
with Kimmie Keegan!

18:52.260 --> 18:55.195
Betty Suarez is going clubbing
with Kimmie Keegan.

18:55.229 --> 18:56.321
Fun.

18:56.397 --> 18:58.797
No, you have no idea
what a big deal this is.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.859
In high school, she wouldn't
even give me the time of day.

19:01.936 --> 19:07.135
And now, I mean,
I really like her and she likes me.

19:07.175 --> 19:10.268
You know, it just goes to show,
you can get over your past,

19:10.310 --> 19:12.369
which is a great lesson for you
and Wilhelmina.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.674
Go.

19:13.714 --> 19:15.045
Going.

19:17.050 --> 19:21.384
I noticed you like a sugar fix after
lunch, so I brought you a cookie.

19:24.758 --> 19:25.850
You're pretty.

19:25.892 --> 19:28.292
I just assumed you weren't
because you're a friend of Betty's.

19:28.328 --> 19:30.159
Betty's the best, isn't she?

19:30.230 --> 19:32.425
I mean, she taught me
everything about this place.

19:32.499 --> 19:35.730
I can collate. I can reduce.
I can do double-sided.

19:35.769 --> 19:37.896
I officially rock the copy room.

19:37.938 --> 19:41.635
Okay. I don't know
where this copy room is.

19:42.676 --> 19:45.406
Look, knowing stuff
is fine for girls like Betty

19:45.445 --> 19:47.936
who don't have their looks
to skate by on,

19:47.981 --> 19:50.915
but I can show you
what's really important.

20:00.693 --> 20:01.717
No.

20:05.931 --> 20:08.866
Oh, my God, can you believe this?

20:08.901 --> 20:11.426
It's so exciting.
My baby's on Broadway!

20:11.504 --> 20:13.870
Okay, ready? Smile.

20:13.906 --> 20:15.965
Mom!

20:18.177 --> 20:21.806
- Okay. I'm gonna go sign in.
- Okay, good luck.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.838
- Hi.
- Sit down, sit down.

20:28.354 --> 20:29.878
What are you doing here?

20:29.922 --> 20:33.119
What? I thought
I'd give the acting thing a try.

20:33.758 --> 20:37.819
Whatever. My mom said
I could only play football if I did this.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.797
Checking out the competition?

20:43.835 --> 20:48.397
He goes to my school.
Trust me, that guy's no competish.

20:50.408 --> 20:52.774
They're sending you on a dinner cruise
around the harbor

20:52.811 --> 20:54.244
so you can get to know her.

20:54.279 --> 20:56.474
I still can't believe
they found someone that fast.

20:56.514 --> 20:59.381
I kind of wish I had time
for that olive oil manicure.

20:59.417 --> 21:03.581
Right. Well, here's a copy
of her profile. Number 49524.

21:03.621 --> 21:07.113
She is smart, a former model,
loves her job,

21:07.158 --> 21:11.561
and her idea of a perfect day
is a picnic in the park with children.

21:12.297 --> 21:15.232
Wow. She sounds perfect.

21:15.266 --> 21:17.699
She'll think you're perfect, too.

21:21.371 --> 21:23.362
Maybe do another button.

21:24.842 --> 21:26.366
The other way.

21:53.503 --> 21:55.698
<i>I don't hate you</i>

21:56.139 --> 21:57.470
Ta-da!

21:58.041 --> 21:59.975
Kimmie. Hi.

22:00.877 --> 22:02.105
You look so...

22:02.144 --> 22:05.875
I know, right? Amanda took me
to the Closet and hair and make-up.

22:05.915 --> 22:08.611
I mean, I can't believe we can just
use those things whenever we want.

22:08.651 --> 22:11.677
We can't. Amanda just tends
to make up her own rules.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.313
Oh. Got it.

22:13.456 --> 22:16.289
Unfortunately, I was talking to Amanda
about us going clubbing tonight,

22:16.359 --> 22:18.759
and she said it would be way more fun
if her and Marc came, too.

22:18.794 --> 22:21.422
No, it... It wouldn't!

22:21.497 --> 22:23.931
Okay, I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

22:23.966 --> 22:27.026
I had to invite them,
but tonight is about you and me.

22:27.069 --> 22:28.934
So don't worry.
We'll totally ignore them.

22:32.508 --> 22:34.942
What are you guys talking about?

22:37.813 --> 22:40.850
- Does it... Can I open this?
- No, too dangerous.

22:40.885 --> 22:42.044
But I know them.

22:42.084 --> 22:45.382
One time, I let my girlfriend open it,
she was shot.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.614
Oh, my God.

22:46.655 --> 22:48.953
On the plus side, I'm single.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.696
What are you laughing about?
What's... What's so funny?

22:55.764 --> 22:58.096
It's too hard to explain.

22:59.267 --> 23:02.862
You could try! You could try.

23:03.872 --> 23:05.533
I'm pretty smart.

23:06.541 --> 23:09.271
You know,
you're not part of their group.

23:10.278 --> 23:11.643
Yes, I am.

23:12.213 --> 23:14.613
Oh, my God, we are totally here.

23:14.649 --> 23:17.846
Guys, guys, we have to pay!

23:27.728 --> 23:32.188
Mr. Meade, welcome. I'm Harmony.

23:32.266 --> 23:34.427
Appropriate, right?
Totally my real name.

23:34.468 --> 23:39.132
But you are not here to talk to me.
Your date is right over there.

23:41.475 --> 23:42.840
Thank you.

23:50.584 --> 23:53.485
You must be 49524.

24:00.961 --> 24:04.727
Your ideal day is a picnic in the park
with the kids?

24:04.765 --> 24:06.392
6'4"?

24:06.433 --> 24:08.333
- I'm leaving.
- No, I'm leaving.

24:08.369 --> 24:10.598
You're not walking out on me.

24:12.839 --> 24:16.138
Wait. Wait, wait, wait! No!
Stop the boat!

24:16.175 --> 24:18.200
You've got to be kidding.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.671
Excuse me.
Sorry, I gotta get through.

24:22.715 --> 24:24.979
- Betty, come on.
I'm with them.

24:25.018 --> 24:26.815
Sorry, I had to pay the cab fare.

24:26.853 --> 24:29.151
Kimmie Keegan, plus three.

24:29.222 --> 24:32.248
I've only got you plus two.
Pick your friends.

24:33.926 --> 24:36.588
- Me! Me! We! We! We!
- Me! Me! Yeah.

24:39.165 --> 24:41.065
How about Marc, Amanda and me go in

24:41.100 --> 24:42.465
and see if it's even worth staying here?

24:42.502 --> 24:43.662
- Okay, bye!
- Miss you!

24:43.703 --> 24:48.538
Wait, or maybe just two of us could
go in and two could stay out here.

24:48.574 --> 24:52.135
Don't worry, if it's cool, then I'll come
and get you. Ten minutes.

24:52.178 --> 24:55.840
Okay, I guess I'll just wait here.

24:56.815 --> 24:58.214
Okay, all right.

25:03.822 --> 25:06.916
- Why are you doing this anyway?
- Excuse me?

25:06.992 --> 25:09.927
There are people here
who take this really seriously.

25:09.961 --> 25:12.395
Like, getting this part
could change their life.

25:13.765 --> 25:15.027
I don't go down to the football field

25:15.067 --> 25:17.194
because I feel like
giving ball-tossing a try.

25:17.235 --> 25:21.001
- You're just mad I'm good.
- Doubt it.

25:21.039 --> 25:22.631
This is good.

25:27.879 --> 25:29.779
That's all you got?

25:36.854 --> 25:39.254
Not bad. But not this.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.435
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, all right.
Save it for the stage. Okay?

25:52.470 --> 25:54.301
Group four, you're up.

25:54.338 --> 25:56.238
- Excuse me.
- Watch it.

25:59.343 --> 26:00.708
Let's go.

26:06.350 --> 26:09.911
Wow. Those guys were really good.

26:09.987 --> 26:13.286
Yeah. I think that short kid
was actually flying.

26:15.926 --> 26:19.225
So, are we ready
to get to know each other?

26:20.597 --> 26:24.158
Watch it, you two.
I'm feeling the tension.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.569
What?

26:33.176 --> 26:37.078
I can't believe Wilhelmina Slater
uses a dating service.

26:37.113 --> 26:40.674
Well, Marc doesn't fulfill
all of my needs.

26:40.717 --> 26:44.016
God knows
he's given it the old college try.

26:44.087 --> 26:47.853
Well, I guess it just shows you
everyone gets lonely.

26:47.891 --> 26:49.950
I'm not lonely. I'm horny!

26:51.461 --> 26:54.862
Your first course
is oysters on the half shell.

26:54.898 --> 26:58.800
They're an aphrodisiac,
not that you need one.

26:59.836 --> 27:02.031
Now, can I bring you two some wine?

27:02.071 --> 27:04.698
- Dear God, yes.
- Yeah, keep it coming.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.842
Hey.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.248
They went with the short kid.

27:19.321 --> 27:21.983
Come here. They're idiots.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.683
<i>Billy Elliot is dead to me.</i>

27:24.760 --> 27:28.355
Yeah, anybody can do
that silly choreography.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.524
You, you make it your own!

27:32.301 --> 27:36.567
Hey, why don't we go and get
some ice cream to cheer you guys up?

27:36.605 --> 27:37.970
Okay.

27:38.006 --> 27:39.064
I'm gonna get my bag.

27:39.107 --> 27:41.439
- Meet you outside.
- All right.

27:58.059 --> 27:59.549
Are you okay?

28:00.461 --> 28:01.758
Go away!

28:04.065 --> 28:06.556
- Could you pass the...
- No.

28:06.601 --> 28:10.332
I hope you didn't fill up,
because you're not done yet.

28:10.371 --> 28:12.100
- Why, how many courses are there?
- Eight.

28:13.307 --> 28:14.638
I know!

28:16.844 --> 28:19.210
I have got to get off this boat.

28:27.221 --> 28:29.086
You can't set the boat on fire.

28:29.123 --> 28:32.455
Explosives work better,
but we didn't plan ahead.

28:33.393 --> 28:34.587
Crap.

28:36.596 --> 28:39.463
Wait, here. Let me show you.

28:44.871 --> 28:47.772
She's coming! Come on. Act casual.

28:50.143 --> 28:53.544
Okay, okay, okay!

28:53.580 --> 28:57.414
Don't panic.
This happens, like, every other cruise.

28:57.484 --> 29:00.817
But just as a precaution,
the captain's heading back to shore.

29:17.369 --> 29:18.563
Taxi!

29:21.907 --> 29:23.101
Betty!

29:24.143 --> 29:28.443
I'm so sorry it took so long.
Wait, you're not leaving, are you?

29:28.480 --> 29:31.381
Kimmie, I've been waiting out here
for 45 minutes.

29:31.450 --> 29:34.385
I mean, it's been fun,
but I think I've had enough.

29:34.420 --> 29:37.548
But you can't go.
We haven't even talked yet.

29:37.589 --> 29:39.079
Kimmie, I don't understand you.

29:39.158 --> 29:40.955
One minute you're like,
"Hey, let's hang out,"

29:40.993 --> 29:45.555
and the next, you're ditching me
and sharing "too hard to explain" jokes.

29:45.597 --> 29:50.000
Look, we don't have to be friends.
Just don't pretend we are if we're not.

29:50.035 --> 29:52.333
No, no, we are friends. I swear.

29:52.371 --> 29:55.898
That's why I got Amanda and Marc in,
so we could ditch them.

29:55.941 --> 29:57.771
- Really?
- Yeah, totally!

29:57.809 --> 29:58.867
We're getting out of here.

29:58.910 --> 30:01.970
I've got us lined up for three more
clubs and a couple after-hours.

30:02.013 --> 30:04.641
Oh. I don't know.
What about work tomorrow?

30:04.716 --> 30:07.276
- We'll be exhausted.
- Not if we go in late.

30:07.352 --> 30:10.446
Daniel and Wilhelmina have a meeting
at the design studio until noon.

30:10.521 --> 30:13.149
They'll never even know we're gone.

30:13.191 --> 30:14.715
It'll be fun!

30:14.759 --> 30:18.456
Getting into these places is so new
for the both of us. Let's do it together.

30:18.496 --> 30:21.932
- Come on, we're friends, aren't we?
- Yeah.

30:21.966 --> 30:23.297
Let's go.

30:23.534 --> 30:24.865
We have so much fun.

30:29.307 --> 30:31.468
I will never forget, Nico was four,

30:31.509 --> 30:33.875
and I was leaving for
the Black and White Ball,

30:33.911 --> 30:36.709
and she threw up all over Armani.

30:36.781 --> 30:39.272
The man, not the gown.

30:41.118 --> 30:45.987
See, that's what I want. I mean,
not that exactly, but the memories,

30:46.590 --> 30:48.285
the perspective it gives you.

30:48.325 --> 30:50.088
I know you think
you have to have kids right away,

30:50.127 --> 30:54.496
but two months with a 12-year-old
is not the same as having a baby.

30:55.499 --> 30:56.659
I know.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.999
So, what you should do is take
all the time you need to prepare.

31:00.036 --> 31:04.029
I mean, Lord knows I screwed up
with Nico, not being ready.

31:04.074 --> 31:06.634
Well, maybe you'll handle things
differently with this baby.

31:06.676 --> 31:07.973
I hope so.

31:08.011 --> 31:12.277
I mean, it wouldn't hurt to hedge
my bets and try to find a partner.

31:12.349 --> 31:15.375
Well, as much as I'm sure me
and the baby

31:15.452 --> 31:20.151
and the nanny will make
a happy household,

31:20.190 --> 31:22.623
there's room for one more person.

31:25.094 --> 31:28.757
So, any idea how the hell
we're gonna handle things

31:28.798 --> 31:30.595
with both of us in charge?

31:32.201 --> 31:35.534
Well, I hate to admit it,
but we did make a good team tonight.

31:35.571 --> 31:36.799
Yeah.

31:36.839 --> 31:40.206
Maybe we should
start trusting each other.

31:41.644 --> 31:46.240
No offense, but I'd say trusting you
would be making a rookie mistake.

31:47.283 --> 31:49.217
Touché.

31:49.251 --> 31:53.085
Perhaps we all have our pasts
to overcome,

31:53.122 --> 31:58.059
but maybe with time,
you'll see that I can change.

32:01.063 --> 32:03.395
Wait, that's not your building.

32:03.566 --> 32:04.965
Um...

32:05.067 --> 32:07.125
I called a buddy.

32:07.168 --> 32:11.696
While I certainly have long-term goals,
I also have short-term needs.

32:37.732 --> 32:38.824
Hello?

32:38.867 --> 32:40.334
Betty? Is everything okay?

32:40.969 --> 32:43.028
Daniel? What time is it?

32:43.071 --> 32:44.163
10:00. My meeting canceled.

32:45.273 --> 32:46.331
Where are you?

32:46.374 --> 32:49.638
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'll be there in a jiff.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.735
Actually, you know what?
Kimmie's here.

32:51.812 --> 32:52.870
<i>Kimmie's there?</i>

32:52.946 --> 32:54.914
<i>- She can cover for you.
- Can I talk to...</i>

32:58.018 --> 33:00.350
I'm here! I'm here!

33:01.522 --> 33:03.353
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

33:03.390 --> 33:06.553
Betty, look! There's pictures of us
from last night all over the Internet.

33:06.593 --> 33:10.120
- That's a picture of you and my elbow.
- Yeah, but you can totally tell it's you.

33:10.163 --> 33:11.255
Hi.

33:11.298 --> 33:14.699
Well, here's one bright spot
this morning.

33:14.735 --> 33:15.963
<i>You got Mode onto Page Six.</i>

33:16.003 --> 33:18.767
We haven't been there in ages.
Good work.

33:21.341 --> 33:24.174
- Nice of you to join us.
- Well, I...

33:24.244 --> 33:26.405
Darn, you got cut out of that one.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.142
Kimmie! What about our pact?

33:29.216 --> 33:31.684
Well, I was an idiot
to think that I could sleep in

33:31.718 --> 33:34.413
when you have total seniority over me,
so I covered for you.

33:34.453 --> 33:37.911
- I texted you.
- I didn't get a text.

33:37.957 --> 33:40.323
That's weird. I sent one.

33:40.359 --> 33:42.623
Nope, no text here.

33:42.662 --> 33:44.596
Well, it must've gotten lost.

33:44.630 --> 33:45.961
She's lying.

33:45.998 --> 33:47.863
I should have known something was up

33:47.900 --> 33:50.630
when she ordered me
that second Long Island iced tea.

33:50.670 --> 33:52.535
By the way, not tea.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.301
What's she trying to do?
Take your job?

33:54.340 --> 33:57.241
No way! She would never
want to work that hard.

33:57.310 --> 33:59.005
Kimmie has just always
drawn her power

33:59.078 --> 34:01.546
from making me look bad
so she looks good.

34:02.815 --> 34:05.511
There's no chance
that text got lost, right?

34:05.551 --> 34:07.746
Well, I texted you
five times this morning,

34:07.787 --> 34:09.583
and you got every single one of those.

34:09.621 --> 34:13.080
You may have graduated,
but high school never ends.

34:17.195 --> 34:18.889
Oh, my God, look how tiny I am!

34:18.929 --> 34:21.489
- You're still tiny!
- I know.

34:22.367 --> 34:23.629
What are you guys looking at?

34:23.668 --> 34:25.498
I wanted to show them
my cheerleading pictures,

34:25.536 --> 34:27.937
so I brought in
our high school yearbook.

34:27.973 --> 34:29.440
Wait, you have to see this.

34:31.076 --> 34:33.476
Oh, my God.

34:33.511 --> 34:37.311
Hello, perm.
It's like someone deep-fried your hair.

34:37.349 --> 34:42.013
And she's wearing the same thing in
her chess club picture as she is today.

34:43.021 --> 34:46.047
- Well, it was a rough morning.
- Then or now?

34:46.091 --> 34:49.958
Don't worry, I'm embarrassed, too.
I mean, my skirts are crazy short!

34:49.995 --> 34:51.462
So short.

34:51.496 --> 34:52.554
Hey, Betty, since you're up,

34:52.597 --> 34:54.496
would you mind getting me a water,
please?

34:54.532 --> 34:55.998
Yeah, sure.

34:57.168 --> 34:58.396
Oh, God.

35:15.386 --> 35:18.184
Betty, you have something
on your skirt.

35:18.789 --> 35:21.314
You've got something
on your skirt.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.625
Not again!

35:35.172 --> 35:36.298
What?

35:37.307 --> 35:41.903
What are you looking at?
She was about to do that to me!

35:41.979 --> 35:45.846
She did it back in high school!
Tell them!

35:45.882 --> 35:48.851
They called me Granny Pants
for four years!

35:49.952 --> 35:52.011
I thought we were friends.

35:54.457 --> 35:57.915
We are. We are friends.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.794
Kimmie, I just thought that...
I thought that you were gonna...

36:02.699 --> 36:03.961
I'm sorry.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.297
Come on.

36:07.236 --> 36:09.295
- La Perla?
- Hanky Panky.

36:09.338 --> 36:12.364
They're totally hot. Granny Pants.

36:13.543 --> 36:15.511
Sexy pants, yeah.

36:35.897 --> 36:37.922
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.197
Bummer about the audition, man.

36:40.235 --> 36:42.362
I can't believe they picked
the short guy over us.

36:42.404 --> 36:44.031
Right? No one's gonna
be able to see him.

36:44.106 --> 36:47.439
- Our vocals were way better.
- And our dance wasn't that bad.

36:47.476 --> 36:50.070
Well, you were kind of
popping your hip.

36:50.145 --> 36:53.581
Well, at least my jazz squares
weren't triangles.

36:53.615 --> 36:55.480
Maybe we'll hang out sometime.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.485
Yeah. That'd be cool.

37:02.090 --> 37:04.991
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.

37:05.026 --> 37:06.152
Bye.

37:11.265 --> 37:13.290
I've got your lunch.

37:13.334 --> 37:17.430
A turkey sandwich
and a slice of chocolate cake.

37:18.372 --> 37:20.772
Dessert, someone's in suck-up mode.

37:20.808 --> 37:24.972
Look, Daniel, I'm so sorry
about being late this morning.

37:25.012 --> 37:26.206
You know that's not me.

37:26.247 --> 37:29.739
Betty. Look, your night out
wasn't such a bad thing.

37:29.784 --> 37:33.185
<i>All those photos of "Kimmie
from Mode" are great publicity.</i>

37:33.220 --> 37:34.585
Really?

37:34.622 --> 37:37.887
Hey, didn't we used to have someone
who worked for us whose job

37:37.925 --> 37:40.587
<i>was just to go out
and get Mode's name in the tabloids?</i>

37:40.628 --> 37:43.358
She was so great
until she went to rehab.

37:43.397 --> 37:45.695
I bet Kimmie could do that job.

37:45.733 --> 37:48.167
- I don't know.
- No, look!

37:48.202 --> 37:50.534
Look at how many clubs
she got us into last night.

37:50.604 --> 37:53.265
I have never seen anyone
work a room like her.

37:53.339 --> 37:56.103
She got George Clooney
to come to our Darfur benefit.

37:56.142 --> 37:57.700
We don't do a Darfur benefit.

37:57.777 --> 38:00.075
We do now. George Clooney's coming!

38:00.180 --> 38:03.206
I'm telling you, Daniel,
she would be great.

38:04.684 --> 38:09.485
I guess a little buzz never hurt.
I'll think about it.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.753
Great.

38:12.525 --> 38:16.359
Oh, my God. I almost forgot to ask you.
How was your date?

38:17.130 --> 38:22.534
Well, it started out rough,
but it ended up in a good place.

38:22.569 --> 38:26.167
- Yay! Are you gonna go out again?
- No.

38:26.202 --> 38:29.766
But I'll probably run into her
somewhere.

38:29.843 --> 38:35.178
Now, moving on to the elusive
center spread. Puppies or war?

38:35.214 --> 38:37.273
We want you to know
we really appreciate your hard work.

38:37.316 --> 38:40.114
We assure you
this is all gonna be settled very soon.

38:40.519 --> 38:44.289
- Actually, it is settled.
- It is?

38:44.324 --> 38:46.382
"Love is a Battlefield. "

38:47.593 --> 38:50.153
I think we both know how true that is.

38:50.195 --> 38:53.426
And I'm sorry
that it took me so long to see it.

38:54.867 --> 38:56.164
Uh...

38:56.735 --> 38:59.533
We'll get that started right away.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.031
One more bit of good news,

39:02.074 --> 39:06.010
most of you have had a chance
to meet Kimmie Keegan by now,

39:06.044 --> 39:08.069
or at least seen her photos
on Page Six.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.845
<i>From now on, she's gonna make sure
that Mode's name</i>

39:11.884 --> 39:14.478
is associated with
all the coolest events.

39:14.519 --> 39:18.852
Wilhelmina and I are promoting her
to Associate Editor.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.994
Thank you.

39:59.297 --> 40:03.323
Wow, that's a big promotion.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.664
Yeah, it was your idea.

40:05.735 --> 40:08.795
I know, but Associate Editor?

40:09.839 --> 40:11.807
Well, if Kimmie's gonna be
in the public eye,

40:11.875 --> 40:14.469
<i>she needs a better title
than "Mode temp," right?</i>

40:14.511 --> 40:17.207
Besides, it's just a title. It's okay.

40:17.247 --> 40:20.512
- I'm so excited for you. Oh, my God.
Thank you.

40:25.188 --> 40:26.746
We'll talk to you later, okay?
Okay.

40:26.790 --> 40:31.818
Kimmie! Congratulations.
You're perfect for this.

40:31.861 --> 40:33.089
I know, right?

40:33.129 --> 40:37.429
I'm gonna need some coffee.
Half-caf Sumatra soy, 121 degrees.

40:39.002 --> 40:42.733
I'm not kidding. I'm myself again.

40:42.772 --> 40:43.898
Ever since you've been helping me,

40:43.974 --> 40:46.533
my confidence has
been creeping back in.

40:46.575 --> 40:48.566
- I should thank you.
- Oh!

40:49.078 --> 40:51.012
But I won't, because I'm popular,

40:51.046 --> 40:53.844
and popular people
aren't nice to unpopular people.

40:53.882 --> 40:56.544
It's just the natural order of things.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.248
I'm still waiting on that coffee,
Granny Pants.
