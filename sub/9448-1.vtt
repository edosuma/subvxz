Uh-oh.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.867
Give me a break.

01:10.367 --> 01:13.166
- So, you guys excited?
- Dream come true.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.467
Yeah, Europe.
Again.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.400
It's just my parents
trying to get rid of me
for two months.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.633
What else is new?

01:19.633 --> 01:21.967
So, Swell, when's your mom
leaving for Australia?

01:21.967 --> 01:23.867
Oh, in about
an hour and a half.

01:23.867 --> 01:27.433
I can't wait.
I'm getting rid of her
for two whole months, you guys.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.767
Wait,
I don't understand.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.967
So, your mom can afford
to go to Australia,

01:30.967 --> 01:34.133
but she can't afford
to send you to Europe with
some friends for graduation?

01:34.133 --> 01:35.600
Yeah, aren't you pissed
you can't go?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.633
Her boyfriend's
paying for it.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.400
He wants her to see
his sheep ranch.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.333
Ooh, wow.
Well, uh, mm.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.333
Besides, she needs
the growing experience
a lot more than I do.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.066
She's leaving you guys
all alone?

01:46.066 --> 01:47.834
What about the kids, hmm?

01:47.834 --> 01:50.033
Kenny will watch Zach,
Melissa will watch Walter,

01:50.033 --> 01:51.900
and I'll have Mom's car.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.900
I can go to the beach,
I can stay out as late
as I want to.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.066
I can do anything.
I'm a free woman.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.567
Melissa!
Lunch, honey.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.033
- Come on!
- Yeah, right.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.033
( growling )

02:16.000 --> 02:18.233
Melissa!
Right now!

02:18.233 --> 02:20.333
Elvis needs
fresh water.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.266
- ( Elvis barks )
- Melissa: I'll do it
in a minute!

02:22.266 --> 02:24.767
Zach, put it back.

02:24.767 --> 02:25.900
Right now.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.467
If you need money,
ask me first.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.500
Okay, then,
can I have $10?

02:30.500 --> 02:31.533
Forget it.

02:31.533 --> 02:33.800
Melissa:
Fry, you suckers.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.500
Earth to Melissa!

02:37.700 --> 02:39.700
How come you gotta go?

02:39.700 --> 02:44.700
Because I've had
a very rough 37 years
and I need a break.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.700
You swore you'd sign me up
for baseball.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.133
Little League
will be there next year.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.767
So will Australia.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.633
- I wish Dad were around.
- No, you don't.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.400
Kenny, you said-- Kenny!
Come on, give me a break!

02:57.400 --> 02:59.233
You haven't taken out
the trash in weeks

02:59.233 --> 03:02.066
and the lawn needs mowing
and your room looks
like a disaster!

03:02.066 --> 03:03.433
All: Hey!

03:03.433 --> 03:06.400
( horn honking )

03:08.266 --> 03:10.900
- See you, Swell!
- Bye, Swell.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.500
Girl: Bye.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.300
Stay away from her.
She's in one of her
Terminator moods.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.000
Hey, Nicole.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.433
- ( overlapping voices )
- We'll miss you.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.467
- Nicole, call me later?
- I will.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.967
- Have a good summer.
- Bye!

03:22.967 --> 03:25.033
- Bye!
- I want your freedom.

03:25.033 --> 03:26.533
( chattering )

03:26.533 --> 03:29.200
Swell, have my baby.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.233
In your dreams, babe.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.000
All: Oh!

03:33.000 --> 03:35.533
Hi, Mom.

03:35.533 --> 03:39.633
Why did you leave your dishes
in the sink for me?

03:39.633 --> 03:42.233
God, you take these things
so personally.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.967
The dishwasher
was full, okay?

03:43.967 --> 03:46.700
- So empty it.
- That's Kenny's job.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.066
- ( engine starts )
- Kenny!

03:49.066 --> 03:50.500
Get back here!

03:50.500 --> 03:52.033
Right now!

03:52.033 --> 03:55.300
I'll do it later, Mom!
I promise.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.734
Isn't your mom, like,
leaving for, like, months?

03:57.734 --> 03:59.700
Oh, shit, you're right.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.133
Bye, Mom!
Have a blast!

04:02.133 --> 04:03.200
Right.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.266
Rock 'n' roll!
( chuckles )

04:09.333 --> 04:10.967
No prizes!

04:10.967 --> 04:12.200
- Hey, Swell.
- Hi.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.166
Well, as usual,
your brother's proven

04:14.166 --> 04:16.533
he's not the least bit
involved with this family.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.700
Oh, relax, Mom.
I'll keep him in line.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.567
Well, did you see
his report card?
He got all Ds.

04:22.567 --> 04:24.066
Well, did you
yell at him?

04:24.066 --> 04:26.700
No. I couldn't.
It's an improvement.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.300
So, Mom,
taking off on us
like that, huh?

04:29.300 --> 04:32.000
Shirking all that
parental responsibility.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.200
Oh, I'm-- I'm sure everything
will be taken care of.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.033
Yeah.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.700
Relax, Mom.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.467
Everything's gonna be great
when you're gone.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.233
( brakes squeak )

04:50.000 --> 04:51.333

05:01.300 --> 05:02.934
( Elvis barking )

05:06.433 --> 05:07.433
Hi.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.233
Hello, dear.

05:09.233 --> 05:12.200
I'm Mrs. Sturak.
I'm the babysitter.

05:13.834 --> 05:15.333
What?

05:15.333 --> 05:17.867
Mother!

05:17.867 --> 05:20.133
She seems
very nice, right?

05:20.133 --> 05:22.367
And she has
lots of experience.

05:22.367 --> 05:23.800
Of course she does.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.867
She's 200 years old.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.033
Melissa:
It's not fair.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.633
Babysitters suck.

05:28.633 --> 05:30.600
( sighs )

05:30.600 --> 05:33.266
- Mrs. Sturak?
- Yes.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.800
You know there are
five children?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.266
Yes, of course.

05:38.266 --> 05:40.233
Do you think you can
handle the job?

05:40.233 --> 05:41.667
Well, of course I can.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.200
My family's all gone.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.300
Taking care of
others' little ones
is my whole life.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.500
Now, I-- I didn't
get a chance to go
to the store,

05:49.500 --> 05:51.433
but there's plenty of money
in here for groceries

05:51.433 --> 05:53.700
and some spending money
for the kids.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.567
There's also
a list of instructions

05:55.567 --> 05:58.367
and the phone number
in Australia, just in case.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.867
You go have
a lovely time.

05:59.867 --> 06:01.600
- ( horn honks )
- Thank you.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.867
Walter,
come give Mommy a kiss.

06:05.266 --> 06:06.767
Mwah.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.300
Bye, Elvis.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.100
- ( Elvis whines )
- Melissa!

06:10.100 --> 06:11.667
Want to come down
from there?

06:11.667 --> 06:12.900
No.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.700
Get down from there.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.700
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.967
A babysitter?

06:21.967 --> 06:25.000
Honey, I couldn't
leave you kids all alone.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.433
You're not capable
of running the show
while I'm gone.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.100
You're not
an adult yet.

06:29.100 --> 06:33.467
Now, I know
we've been over this
at least a thousand times,

06:33.467 --> 06:36.834
but please don't do anything
you know I'd be against.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.934
I don't wanna come home
and hear you've given this
nice, old lady a hard time.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.100
You're gonna miss
your flight.

06:42.834 --> 06:47.100
Promise me you'll go
register at City College
for fall, okay?

06:47.100 --> 06:49.967
Well, I haven't quite
decided on that yet.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.533
I'll miss you.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.734
- ( kisses )
- Bye, Mom.

06:56.734 --> 06:57.934
Bye.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.367
Bye, everybody!

06:59.367 --> 07:01.767
Listen to Mrs. Sturak.

07:01.767 --> 07:02.934
- Mom!
- Hmm?

07:02.934 --> 07:04.100
Will you call us
every day?

07:04.100 --> 07:07.567
Ha, Walter,
this is Mom's vacation,

07:07.567 --> 07:08.667
but I'll try.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.066
Mrs. Sturak, mwah,
knows where to reach me.

07:11.066 --> 07:13.400
Bye, sweetheart.
Mwah. Be good.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.233
- Bye, Mom.
- Love you. Bye, honey.

07:15.233 --> 07:17.066
Be good, everybody! Bye!

07:17.066 --> 07:20.367
- Bye!
- Take care of each other!

07:37.433 --> 07:39.367
All right,
you little maggots,
now line up.

07:39.367 --> 07:40.967
Time to go
over the rules.

07:40.967 --> 07:43.500
Excuse me?
Are you serious?

07:43.500 --> 07:46.100
You can't run a tight ship
without rules.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.333
Now move!

07:49.567 --> 07:52.200
- Jeez, what's
this lady's problem?
- She's scary.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.900
Yeah, skeleton
and skin.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.867
Look, lady, I don't know
what your deal is,

07:55.867 --> 07:57.767
but you're not here
to order us around.

07:57.767 --> 08:00.967
I've had about enough
of your lip, missy.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.400
Cooperate...

11:10.834 --> 11:12.934
( scoffs )
The hag probably
can't even hear me.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.867
Swell:
Look, Mrs. Sturak,

11:16.867 --> 11:19.200
whether you think that
you can push us around or not,

11:19.200 --> 11:22.333
we have decided that we're not
gonna take any more of
your crap, okay?

11:29.233 --> 11:30.934
( panting )

11:33.900 --> 11:36.867
Now, first of all,
the name tags have gotta go.

11:36.867 --> 11:39.867
Mrs. Sturak,
are you even
listening to me?

11:39.867 --> 11:41.433
Mrs. Sturak?

11:52.734 --> 11:55.166
( chair creaks )

11:55.166 --> 11:56.667
Mrs. Sturak?

12:00.767 --> 12:02.633
Mrs. Sturak? Hello?

12:07.834 --> 12:09.667
Oh, my God.

12:10.934 --> 12:12.200
Oh.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.734
- ( pot shatters )
- Fuck.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.934
- ( Elvis barks )
- Kenny?

12:19.934 --> 12:21.800
Hey, get out.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.300
Kenny, I think you should
come downstairs.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.300
You're not gonna
believe this.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.233
We told you
to talk to her.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.500
We didn't want you to send
her to the glue factory.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.300
I didn't kill her, Zach.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.066
She died in her sleep.

12:36.066 --> 12:38.166
Probably choked
on her whistle.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.934
- She doesn't look dead.
- That's 'cause it
just happened.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.900
So you can't really tell,
like on "MacGyver."

12:43.900 --> 12:46.533
Um, what should we do
with her body?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.800
( sighs )

12:47.800 --> 12:50.266
Call an ambulance,
call the cops?
I don't know.

12:50.266 --> 12:51.500
I mean, they're gonna
come and get her.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.834
They're gonna ask us
a lot of questions.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.900
They'll probably blame us.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.333
They'll definitely
call Mom.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.767
She'll blame us.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.266
Yeah, she'll hop
the next flight home

12:59.266 --> 13:01.066
and then she'll be
in our faces.

13:01.066 --> 13:02.667
I don't want Mom
to come home.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.667
I don't either.

13:07.467 --> 13:09.333
- Kenny: Easy now.
- Melissa: She's starting
to stink.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.533
Zach:
No, it's too soon.

13:10.533 --> 13:12.367
- Then it must be you.
- Shut up.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.333
- Kenny: Be careful.
- Swell: I got her!

13:14.333 --> 13:15.934
No, I mean my skateboard.

13:15.934 --> 13:17.533
Walter:
It's right on my foot.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.467
( creaks )

13:21.467 --> 13:23.100
Sure she's gonna fit?

13:23.100 --> 13:25.367
How the hell should I know?
I've never done this before.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.633
Well, neither have I.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.900
I think we should
measure her first.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.533
Let's hack off
her head.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.100
Yeah!

13:33.100 --> 13:34.433
Uh, all right.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.700
Go get that metal
tape measure thing
out of the garage.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.600
Would you stop
ordering us around?
You're not the babysitter.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.066
That's right, Kenny.

13:41.066 --> 13:42.533
The babysitter is dead.

13:42.533 --> 13:43.867
Now just do it!

13:46.233 --> 13:49.166
Swell: I mean, we're saving
the ambulance people
a trip, right?

13:49.166 --> 13:52.266
I mean, when they find her,
they'll-- they'll take care
of everything.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.333
And no one has to know
she was our sitter.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.734
Right. I mean,
she said she didn't
have any family,

13:56.734 --> 14:01.333
so this is--
this is really
the decent thing to do.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.867
( thunder rumbling )

14:04.867 --> 14:06.967
( thunder crashes )

14:13.633 --> 14:14.900
Bobby.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.266
What? Oh.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.033
Now, who would do
such a thing?

14:24.033 --> 14:25.934
- I don't know, man.
- I don't mind death.

14:25.934 --> 14:28.467
( grunts )
It's the lifting
that gets me.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.800
Watch it.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.200
God, I feel terrible.

14:37.567 --> 14:39.000
I should've
been nicer to her.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.567
I should've cooperated.

14:42.567 --> 14:45.700
Yeah, she was
a great babysitter.

14:51.066 --> 14:52.667
Walter:
Hey, where are you going?

14:52.667 --> 14:54.433
We're out of food.
I'm going marketing.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.834
Yeah, massive
party supplies.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.433
Shotgun!

15:03.567 --> 15:05.800
You're taking
Mrs. Sturak's car?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.333
( sighs )

15:08.600 --> 15:11.300
Zach, life goes on.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.734
I mean, come on!
This car's a classic.

15:14.734 --> 15:17.433
I think that she'd
want it this way.
Don't you?

15:24.533 --> 15:26.433
How much
did Mom leave us?

15:29.900 --> 15:31.667
There's no money in here.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.367
Yes, there is.
I saw Mom give it
to Mrs. Sturak.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.133
Well, she must've
taken it out.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.400
- ( tires screeching )
- ( horns honking )

15:40.400 --> 15:42.066
Holy shit!

15:45.934 --> 15:47.500
Excuse me,
coming through!

15:47.500 --> 15:50.233
( clamoring )

15:50.233 --> 15:51.567
- Kenny: Damn it!
- Melissa: Look under the bed.

15:51.567 --> 15:54.133
( clamoring continues )

15:54.133 --> 15:55.967
Kenny:
Where? Where is
the damn thing?

15:55.967 --> 15:57.900
Melissa:
Shoot.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.300
- Walter: Ow!
- Get out of my way.

16:01.433 --> 16:03.066
Kenny:
Come on,
come on, come on!

16:03.066 --> 16:04.133
Ugh!

16:04.133 --> 16:06.266
Kenny:
I looked in there already.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.200
Walter:
Check the box.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.400
- She must've had it on her.
- Well, it's ours.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.333
Go back and get it
from the old hag.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.934
Oh, yeah, right.
We go and say,

16:15.934 --> 16:18.734
"Excuse me,
we left our money
on our dead babysitter."

16:18.734 --> 16:20.767
No way!

16:20.767 --> 16:22.400
Who's gonna clean
this place up?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.967
Kids: Not me.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.967
- 50...
- Kenny: What are we
gonna do for cash

16:28.967 --> 16:30.734
- ...75.
- ...for the next two months?

16:30.734 --> 16:32.934
- Swell: All right, um,
what about a garage sale?
- Dollar.

16:32.934 --> 16:34.667
We live in the boonies.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.133
How about calling Dad?

16:36.133 --> 16:37.934
Dad doesn't care.

16:37.934 --> 16:39.533
What about
blackmailing Dad?

16:39.533 --> 16:42.133
What about donating blood?
They pay you.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.900
You have to be over 18.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.433
Well, there goes
our great summer.

16:46.433 --> 16:49.166
( phone ringing )

16:49.166 --> 16:50.400
Hello?

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
Mom!

16:52.800 --> 16:55.367
Hi, Mom.

16:55.367 --> 16:57.533
How's Australia?

16:57.533 --> 16:59.400
Really?
Oh, great.

17:00.633 --> 17:02.567
Yeah, they're fine.
Everything's fine.

17:03.767 --> 17:06.767
Oh, uh, Mrs. Sturak?

17:06.767 --> 17:10.099
Well, she's not here
right now.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.066
No, she had a date.

17:12.066 --> 17:14.532
Some guy.
A mortician.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.000
Relax, Mom.
I'm looking after things
while she's gone.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.266
And everything's
gonna be fine, Mom.

17:18.266 --> 17:20.500
I love you, too.
Okay, got it.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
All right.
All right, bye.
Bye, bye, bye.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.767
You only got
one bag of chips?

17:26.767 --> 17:29.000
We could only afford
the necessities, Kenny.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
This place is a crock.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.500
We're never gonna make it
two months.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.767
Man, I'm gonna hole up
at Lizard's.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.967
Oh, that's real brotherly.

17:36.967 --> 17:39.767
- Don't you have
any pride?
- No.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.834
When our food's gone,
we can eat Elvis.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.900
- ( whines )
- Swell: What do you guys
want from me?

17:44.900 --> 17:46.500
Would you like me
to call Mom back?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.400
- 'Cause I can.
- No.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.300
Do you wanna call Aunt Pat
or go crawling to one of Mom's
semi-wretched friends?

17:52.300 --> 17:54.233
- No.
- Both: No.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.900
Look, we don't need
a warden.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.200
We don't need
some adult around

17:57.200 --> 17:59.266
telling us when to eat
and sleep and vacuum, right?

17:59.266 --> 18:00.433
Both: Right.

18:00.433 --> 18:01.667
I mean, we could still
have a great summer.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.200
We just gotta
stick together, okay?

18:03.200 --> 18:04.600
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.400
- Totally.
- Okay.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.900
Well, uh, one of us
has to get a job.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.533
( scoffs )
Well, I'm not gonna.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.467
Well, we don't have
any choice.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.900
We'll flip for it.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.767
Mama Celeste face up,
I go to work.

18:19.767 --> 18:23.467
Mama Celeste face down,
you're selling carnations
on a freeway off-ramp.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.100
Okay, I'll get a job.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.300
But you gotta stay here
and watch the kids, okay?

18:33.300 --> 18:35.600
Hey, no problem,
twisted sister.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.967
Okay.

18:36.967 --> 18:39.000
I can get a job
at a clothing store
or something.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.300
I mean, they'll
hire me in a second.
It'll be great.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.166
( circus music playing )

18:44.166 --> 18:46.500
( motorcycle engine roars )

18:53.433 --> 18:55.967
- ( chatter )
- Kid: Mommy!

18:58.033 --> 19:00.967
Hey, you gotta squeeze the fat
out of those burgers better.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.433
Yeah, you're getting
the hang of it.
( spits )

19:09.400 --> 19:11.133
Hi.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.266
I'm Bryan.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.700
Swell, remember!

19:15.700 --> 19:17.600
Put on a happy face.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.033
( whistling circus theme )

19:21.033 --> 19:23.166
Did he just finish reading
"Dianetics" or something?

19:23.166 --> 19:24.767
Oh, no.
He's just on helium.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.600
Bryan!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.233
Another happy delivery!

19:30.200 --> 19:33.133
Swell, you gotta put chili
on those clown dogs,

19:33.133 --> 19:35.633
and keep it moving.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.800
( whistling circus theme )

19:38.200 --> 19:39.533
( sizzling )

19:44.433 --> 19:47.333
( laughing, chatter )

19:49.700 --> 19:51.133
This is great, man.

19:51.133 --> 19:52.567
My sister's working.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.900
There's no one around
nagging me anymore.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.767
I'm born free.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.000
Hey, dude,
let's get out of here.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.300
- Let's go to Guitar Center.
- Boy: Wait, guys.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.500
We seem to be experiencing
a little negative cash flow
problem here.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.834
Let's go to my place.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.300
I'll rip off my mom's
MasterCard again.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.066
- Master the possibilities.
- ( all laughing )

20:11.066 --> 20:13.300
So, guys, I gotta
get out of here, man.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.500
My old man is pissed
about my report card.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
I gotta kiss ass
a couple more days.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.533
( smooching )

20:20.533 --> 20:22.367
You know what, guys?

20:22.367 --> 20:24.033
We keep this up...
( chuckles )

20:25.333 --> 20:27.033
we're never getting
out of school, man.

20:28.734 --> 20:30.834
- Both: Far out!
- Yeah!

20:30.834 --> 20:33.400
Rock 'n' roll!
Whoo!

20:33.400 --> 20:35.266
( all cheering )

20:37.633 --> 20:39.033
- Whoa!
- Come on, get it!

20:39.033 --> 20:39.934
Oh!

20:45.800 --> 20:48.066
- ( water sloshing )
- ( dishes clattering )

20:57.000 --> 20:59.433
( whistling tune )

21:02.233 --> 21:04.233
( music playing )

21:11.667 --> 21:12.934
Thanks.

21:12.934 --> 21:14.066
Oh, sure.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.567
Did you have
a lot of deliveries?

21:21.567 --> 21:22.867
Yeah.

21:22.867 --> 21:24.767
I'm the stork
of fast food.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.600
Lucky.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.900
Better than being here.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.266
Yeah, I guess.

21:36.467 --> 21:37.467
( exhales )

21:37.467 --> 21:40.233
God, this place
is so disgusting.

21:40.233 --> 21:43.133
- How can you stand it?
- I just try to hang with it.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.867
Shit.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.533
Gross.

21:52.533 --> 21:53.800
Not your dream job, huh?

21:53.800 --> 21:55.000
You got that right.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.500
You think I woke up
this morning and thought,

21:58.500 --> 22:01.567
"Gee, I'd love
to scrub fat vats.

22:01.567 --> 22:04.000
I'd love to smile
and work with raw meat."

22:04.000 --> 22:06.367
At least it gives you
some extra cash,
though, right?

22:06.367 --> 22:09.166
I'm not working
at the big top from hell
for pocket money.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.567
My mom's out of town for a while
and I have my brothers
and sister to feed.

22:12.567 --> 22:16.233
And no one's gonna
hire a teenager to do
anything that isn't disgusting.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.834
Why can't I just get a job
at some nice, clean office?

22:18.834 --> 22:20.400
Why don't you just quit?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.567
( whistling )
Swell!

22:22.567 --> 22:24.200
How's the scrub-a-dub
dubbing going?

22:25.700 --> 22:28.066
Now, you're almost
doing that correctly,

22:28.066 --> 22:31.066
but you forgot
one very big thing.

22:31.066 --> 22:32.600
What, not enough
cleanser?

22:32.600 --> 22:36.400
Nope.
You forgot
to put on a happy face.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.667
Next, you get
to scrape the spitballs

22:39.667 --> 22:41.233
off the drive-thru window

22:41.233 --> 22:43.767
with a really fun
squeegee.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.533
Look, Mr. Egg,

22:51.533 --> 22:54.033
finish the happy
fat vats yourself.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.333
Thanks for your advice.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.900
Maybe I'll see you around.

24:52.066 --> 24:53.567
Your number?

24:53.567 --> 24:55.367
Um, excuse me?

24:55.367 --> 24:57.133
I'm applying for
the receptionist position.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.900
- Hold.
- ( phone ringing )

24:58.900 --> 25:00.967
- Reception.
- ( elevator dings )

25:00.967 --> 25:02.166
I can't right now.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.467
I have to stay
and redirect

25:03.467 --> 25:05.233
all the incompetents
who are coming up here

25:05.233 --> 25:08.467
instead of going
straight down to personnel
like they are supposed to.

25:08.467 --> 25:11.700
All right, all right,
all right, all right.
I'll be right there.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.867
You'll have
about 12 seconds.

25:15.567 --> 25:17.800
( phone ringing )

25:17.800 --> 25:22.200
You are supposed to go
down to per-so-nnel.

25:22.200 --> 25:26.200
That is on
the first floor.

25:26.200 --> 25:30.300
There is a great big sign
that says...

25:31.800 --> 25:33.834
"per-so-nnel."

25:33.834 --> 25:37.667
Do... you... understand?

25:37.667 --> 25:38.567
Yeah.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.500
Where's Carolyn?

25:47.500 --> 25:49.400
Mouse-brown hair,
gives you a headache.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.266
Talks like she's
chewing her face.

25:51.266 --> 25:52.667
That's her.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.600
She'll be back
in a few seconds.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.400
I'm here for
the receptionist job.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.500
Is this your resume?

25:57.500 --> 25:58.700
Yeah.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.867
Wow!

26:05.867 --> 26:07.400
Very impressive.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.133
This is fabulous!

26:10.133 --> 26:11.500
Thank you.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.033
Okay, listen.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.166
They're looking
for a receptionist
to replace Carol,

26:17.166 --> 26:21.400
and she's supposed to
move up to be my executive
administrative assistant.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.000
I can't stand her.
So do me a favor.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.400
You be my assistant,
and I'll just tell them
I hired outside the company.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.300
Well, what about
the receptionist job?

26:29.300 --> 26:31.100
What, are you
burnt out?

26:31.100 --> 26:33.100
You wanna take
a step down?

26:33.100 --> 26:35.433
Well, I won't let you.
I need you!

26:35.433 --> 26:39.467
And besides,
you're so overqualified for
entry-level, it's ridiculous!

26:39.467 --> 26:42.333
For God's sake,
you're a Vassar gal!

26:42.333 --> 26:45.734
You'd much rather be
my executive assistant.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.433
Please say yes.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.133
Yes.

26:50.133 --> 26:52.300
Okay, we're up here with
the other vice presidents,

26:52.300 --> 26:54.400
our executive staff,
and our advertising people.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.333
Downstairs are the designers,
our warehouse and showroom,

26:57.333 --> 26:59.367
and our manufacturing
and assembly lines.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.867
You graduated
six years ago,
so you're 27, 28?

27:01.867 --> 27:04.066
- Uh, yeah.
- ( sighs ) Well,
you don't look it.

27:04.066 --> 27:06.400
Thank God.
My last assistant
was only 23

27:06.400 --> 27:07.900
and still wet
behind the ears.

27:09.767 --> 27:11.934
Okay, this is
your office.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.533
Mine's through the archway.
These are your things.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.433
Rolodex.
There's your computer--
WordStar and Lotus.

27:17.433 --> 27:18.834
There's your mouse.

27:18.834 --> 27:20.266
Refrigerator's
over there.

27:20.266 --> 27:22.367
Just leave a list for Carol
and she'll stock it for you.

27:22.367 --> 27:23.500
- Okay?
- Okay.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.767
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.200
Great!

27:26.200 --> 27:28.000
So, these are my things.
Okay.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.867
Oh! When do I get paid?

27:31.166 --> 27:33.200
1st and 15th
of every month.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
- Is that it?
- Mm-hmm.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.400
Great.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.767
- Gus! Hi.
- Hi.

27:38.767 --> 27:41.533
This is my new administrative
assistant, Sue Ellen.

27:41.533 --> 27:44.900
Sue Ellen, this is Gus Brandon,
vice president of marketing.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.600
- And he serves me
breakfast in bed.
- Only when she deserves it.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.667
( both laughing )

27:49.667 --> 27:51.600
- Nice to meet you.
- Good morning.

27:52.734 --> 27:53.734
See you for lunch?

27:53.734 --> 27:55.233
I'll let you know.

27:55.233 --> 27:56.767
I'm interfacing
with New York at 3:00

27:56.767 --> 27:58.667
and I have a report due
at the end of the day.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.333
Okay, we'll play it
by ear.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.033
Woman:
Talk to you later.

28:02.033 --> 28:03.667
Mm, bye.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.166
Sue Ellen, right?

28:05.166 --> 28:06.066
Mm-hmm.

28:07.900 --> 28:10.867
( both chuckling )

28:10.867 --> 28:13.900
- ( door closes )
- Okay, have a great weekend.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.333
See you Monday,
8:00 sharp.

28:15.333 --> 28:18.066
( giggles )

28:18.066 --> 28:22.333
By the way, I'm Rose Lindsey,
senior vice president
of operations.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.500
- Hi.
- And when Beatrice
from personnel calls,

28:24.500 --> 28:26.166
she's a really
pushy broad.

28:26.166 --> 28:27.734
Just tell her
I hired you.

28:27.734 --> 28:30.800
And find out about
your medical benefits
and pension plan.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.800
Oh, one more thing,

28:32.800 --> 28:34.900
and this is
so important.

28:34.900 --> 28:38.200
Whenever we're not alone
or I'm on the phone and
I ask you something--

28:38.200 --> 28:39.800
doesn't matter
what it is--

28:39.800 --> 28:41.533
you always say,

28:41.533 --> 28:43.700
"I'm right on top
of that, Rose."

28:43.700 --> 28:46.233
- Okay?
- Okay.

28:46.233 --> 28:47.967
Welcome aboard,
sweetie.

28:47.967 --> 28:49.400
- Thank you.
- Oh.

29:00.066 --> 29:01.934
Melissa:
I'm gonna get you, sucker!

29:01.934 --> 29:04.033
Yeah.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.600
Swell: So, I walk in there
and the receptionist
is such a tool.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.800
- I wanted to slug her.
- I need more money.

29:11.533 --> 29:12.700
Get out of here.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.300
Anyway,
I have my own office

29:16.300 --> 29:18.834
and this little fridge
stocked with, like,
diet Sprite and Tab.

29:18.834 --> 29:20.033
And I have
a great view.

29:20.033 --> 29:22.033
What's the job?

29:22.033 --> 29:24.333
I am the executive
administrative assistant

29:24.333 --> 29:26.934
to the senior vice president
of operations.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.600
What the hell is that?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.834
I don't know.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.600
So, what are they
gonna pay you?

29:31.600 --> 29:35.000
$37,500 a year.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.500
No way!

29:36.500 --> 29:38.700
Shit, you're gonna drown!

29:38.700 --> 29:40.233
( chuckles )
Choke!

29:40.233 --> 29:41.967
I'm a fast learner.

29:41.967 --> 29:43.166
I'll catch on.

29:43.166 --> 29:44.900
You're never gonna
get to the beach.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.467
Yeah, but who cares?

29:46.467 --> 29:48.133
I'm a career woman now.

29:48.133 --> 29:50.066
You better bring
some bucks home tomorrow.

29:50.066 --> 29:52.066
We're, like,
totally out of food.

29:52.066 --> 29:55.100
Wait a minute,
I don't get paid
for two weeks.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.100
Help.
We need money.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.767
We have no food.

29:58.767 --> 30:01.066
- Hey!
- Melissa: Are those
drag queens?

30:01.066 --> 30:03.200
- Walter: What's a drag queen?
- That's our car!

30:03.200 --> 30:05.934
Let's go, let's go!

30:05.934 --> 30:08.433
Hey! What are you queens
doing in our car?!

30:08.433 --> 30:10.200
( engine starts )

30:10.200 --> 30:12.300
Step on it!

30:12.300 --> 30:13.633
Both: Liza?

30:14.934 --> 30:16.333
( tires screeching )

30:22.834 --> 30:24.033
Swell: Shit!

30:24.033 --> 30:25.433
I love that car.

30:25.433 --> 30:26.834
Call the cops.

30:26.834 --> 30:27.834
Oh, yeah,
what are we gonna say?

30:27.834 --> 30:29.600
Liza Minelli
stole our Buick?

30:29.600 --> 30:30.834
It wasn't even
our Buick.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.066
This sucks.

30:32.066 --> 30:33.467
Now how are we
gonna get home?

30:33.467 --> 30:34.934
I miss Mommy.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.133
Call Nicole.

30:40.133 --> 30:41.934
All of my friends
are in Europe.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.667
Well, what about
Lizard or Hellhound?

30:45.667 --> 30:47.233
We don't have
any money.

30:47.233 --> 30:48.734
You mean you'd
have to bribe them?

30:48.734 --> 30:49.900
Yeah.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.200
Come on.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.000
Who else do you know
that drives?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.900
( circus music playing )

31:02.033 --> 31:03.767
( truck thudding )

31:10.633 --> 31:12.033
- Who's the bozo?
- ( music stops )

31:14.166 --> 31:17.166
Hi. Um,
thanks for coming.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.500
No problem.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.367
I kind of like
being a hero.

31:20.367 --> 31:22.300
Me and my trusty steed.

31:25.266 --> 31:27.266
Just get in the car.
Come on.

31:27.266 --> 31:28.266
Come on.

31:36.166 --> 31:38.967
Swell: Well, my mom
doesn't want us to use
her Volvo while she's away.

31:38.967 --> 31:41.567
( sighs )
Can't believe my friends
ditched us like that.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.767
Bryan:
Hey, but wasn't that your car

31:42.767 --> 31:44.100
I saw at the Clown Dog
the other night?

31:44.100 --> 31:45.467
Cool chrome,
white walls, and stuff?

31:45.467 --> 31:48.166
Yeah, well,
it was kind of a loaner.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.166
Melissa:
Swell, what are you
doing out there?

31:50.166 --> 31:51.500
- Come on!
- Hold on!

31:51.500 --> 31:53.033
I'll be there
in a minute.

31:53.033 --> 31:55.100
( kids arguing )

31:55.100 --> 31:58.500
Look, I'm sorry if I acted
like a bitch the other night
at Clown Dog.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.266
You know, just walking out
like that and everything.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.233
Yeah, you really
cracked Mr. Egg
when you left.

32:02.233 --> 32:05.166
Really?
Did you get stuck
finishing the fat vats?

32:05.166 --> 32:06.767
Lard is my life.

32:06.767 --> 32:09.166
- ( arguing continues )
- At least until college.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.800
- Walter: Zach!
- Melissa: I'm gonna smack you!

32:10.800 --> 32:12.467
I'm glad
you called, really.

32:12.467 --> 32:13.500
Yeah, me, too.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.266
Swell, could you
hurry it up?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.266
Melissa and Zach
are beating each other up

32:17.266 --> 32:19.333
over the last snowball.

32:19.333 --> 32:21.066
- It's the last food we got.
- ( crashing )

32:21.066 --> 32:22.767
( Melissa screaming )

32:22.767 --> 32:24.433
Are you guys
really out of food?

32:24.433 --> 32:26.667
Oh, no.
They're just
being obnoxious.

32:26.667 --> 32:28.433
I'm gonna go to the market
first thing in the morning.

32:28.433 --> 32:30.300
You sure?
'Cause I've got
some extra leftovers

32:30.300 --> 32:31.934
from my dinner
delivery stock.

32:31.934 --> 32:34.100
You know,
if you want 'em.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.367
- No, that's okay.

32:35.367 --> 32:38.667

32:38.667 --> 32:40.066
Well, maybe we'll
take them.

32:40.066 --> 32:42.233
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.633
So, you wanna
go to the beach

32:44.633 --> 32:46.166
and watch the grunion run
Monday night?

32:46.166 --> 32:47.767
You mean a date?

32:48.934 --> 32:50.500
Yeah, well, I'm free.
( sighs )

32:50.500 --> 32:52.667
I mean, I gotta check
with the grunion, but...

32:54.133 --> 32:55.700
Yeah, a date.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.233
Yeah, sure.

32:57.233 --> 32:59.433
- I like grunion.
- Yeah, me, too.

32:59.433 --> 33:01.133
Thanks again.

33:01.133 --> 33:02.600

I work for her now.

34:36.132 --> 34:37.400
You?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.033
Yeah, hi.
I'm Sue Ellen.

34:41.567 --> 34:44.766
Well, don't bother getting
too settled in, hmm?

34:44.766 --> 34:46.500
Okay.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.367
Rose: Well, yes, we have
temporarily cut back
on quality fabrics

34:53.367 --> 34:55.500
due to a receding
profit margin.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.934
Yes, I understand.

34:56.934 --> 34:59.333
Any time you wanna
come back to the GAW.

34:59.333 --> 35:02.467
Well, thank you
for telling me
personally.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.900
- Bye-bye.
- ( phone clicks )

35:03.900 --> 35:05.900
Would you all please
excuse us for a minute?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.533
- Yeah, sure, Rose.
- Fabulous.

35:09.633 --> 35:11.600
Oh, Lord!

35:11.600 --> 35:13.600
We just lost
another account.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.400
Costs are up,
overhead is high,
sales are down.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.300
- ( door closes )
- New York's gonna be
none too thrilled

35:18.300 --> 35:21.133
with their industrial
uniform division.

35:21.133 --> 35:24.033
This is our new
spring line.

35:24.033 --> 35:25.900
Lovely, isn't it?

35:25.900 --> 35:27.600
Yeah, lovely.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.667
You know,
I thought we made
designer clothes.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.100
( chuckles )

35:32.100 --> 35:34.066
Sue Ellen, no.

35:34.066 --> 35:37.100
We're in the bowels
of the fashion industry.

35:37.100 --> 35:41.567
General Apparel West
is one of 32 subdivisions
of ChemTech America,

35:41.567 --> 35:43.834
one of our nation's leading
chemical corporations.

35:43.834 --> 35:46.467
This is
our design area.

35:46.467 --> 35:50.266
And this is Franklin,
our head designer.

35:50.266 --> 35:51.734
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

35:51.734 --> 35:54.367
You'll be verifying
his purchase orders
pending my approval

35:54.367 --> 35:56.367
and consulting with him
on budget estimates.

35:56.367 --> 35:58.066
Bye, Franklin.

35:58.066 --> 35:59.967
Bye.

35:59.967 --> 36:01.367
You'll also be
coordinating our sales,

36:01.367 --> 36:03.500
manufacturing,
and advertising people.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.533
I'm gonna need
biweekly reports from you.

36:05.533 --> 36:08.100
Basically, you're the hub
of our communication network.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.367
The hub.

36:09.367 --> 36:10.834
- ( keyboard clacking )
- ( computer beeping )

36:13.100 --> 36:15.000
( clacking, beeping
continue )

36:17.667 --> 36:19.266
I hate you!

36:19.266 --> 36:21.166
Sue Ellen!

36:21.166 --> 36:24.300
Start getting updated reports
from the department heads
and coordinating them.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.700
You can access the format
on the C drive.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.400
Until you lay it out
on a spreadsheet

36:28.400 --> 36:30.266
the market analysis
is too amorphous, right?

36:31.633 --> 36:33.900
This is the QED report.
I've made some notes in it.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.300
See if you can
make a dent after lunch.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.033
Oh, and fax this
to New York for me.

36:38.266 --> 36:39.700
Don't feel overwhelmed.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.467
Just do one thing
at a time.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.533
( sighs )

36:49.367 --> 36:51.533
Looking for something,
Sue Ellen?

36:51.533 --> 36:52.667
Yeah.

36:54.333 --> 36:55.533
Where did that
come from?

36:55.533 --> 36:57.834
I had it delivered.
Do you have a problem with that?

36:57.834 --> 36:59.500
Uh, no.
I was just wondering

36:59.500 --> 37:01.867
why they would
come all this way
just to bring you a chili dog.

37:01.867 --> 37:04.567
My little brother
drives the delivery van.

37:04.567 --> 37:08.867
Occasionally,
he goes out of his way
to bring me lunch.

37:08.867 --> 37:10.233
All right?

37:10.233 --> 37:11.633
That's nice.

37:11.633 --> 37:13.333
Your little brother.

37:13.333 --> 37:16.867
Um, I need to fax something.
How would I do that?

37:16.867 --> 37:18.367
Gosh, Sue Ellen,

37:18.367 --> 37:20.667
being an executive
administrative assistant,

37:20.667 --> 37:22.633
I'm sure you can
figure that out.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.767
( fax machine whirring )

37:30.233 --> 37:33.200
( beeping )

37:33.200 --> 37:35.033
( crunching )

37:36.867 --> 37:40.800
- ( grinding )
- ( phone ringing )

37:40.800 --> 37:42.767
- Hello?
- ( fax tone screeching )

37:48.166 --> 37:49.433
( sighs )

37:50.767 --> 37:52.600
Oh, hi!
Are you a temp?

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
No. Um,
I'm Sue Ellen.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.066
I work for Rose.

37:56.066 --> 37:57.100
Oh, hi!

37:57.100 --> 37:58.800
- Hi.
- I'm Cathy.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.600
So, you're
Rose's new executive
administrative assistant.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.233
- Well, congratulations.
- ( beeping continues )

38:04.233 --> 38:06.967
- ( beeping stops )
- I submitted my resume,
but it wasn't good enough.

38:06.967 --> 38:10.233
Wow, working with Rose
must be so neat!

38:10.233 --> 38:12.333
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I cutting in front of you?

38:12.333 --> 38:13.867
- Are you faxing?
- No, no, no.

38:13.867 --> 38:18.667
I'm-- I'm still
organizing my spreadsheet
and my projection.

38:18.667 --> 38:21.233
- Amorphous type
of stuff, yeah.
- Oh, right.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.500
( beeping )

38:31.033 --> 38:34.533
So, anyway, I'm Fred Kibber's
secretary over in sales.

38:34.533 --> 38:36.800
It has been
really slow.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.333
Gosh!

38:38.333 --> 38:39.934
You're swamped!

38:39.934 --> 38:41.300
Yeah.
( sighs )

38:41.300 --> 38:43.333
Well, I'm a wiz
on the computer,

38:43.333 --> 38:45.900
so if you ever have
anything for me,
just ask.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.233
Well, hey,
if you want, um,

38:48.233 --> 38:50.133
are you familiar
with the QED report?

38:50.133 --> 38:53.333
Oh, wow.
Really?

38:53.333 --> 38:55.133
Yeah, go ahead.
Really.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.700
Thank you.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.300
Thanks.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.600
Oh, and, uh,
don't feel overwhelmed.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.900
Just do one thing
at a time.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.033
Right.

39:05.033 --> 39:07.667
( phone ringing )

39:11.300 --> 39:12.667
( fly buzzing )

39:14.633 --> 39:17.000
- Hello?
- Hi. How's it going?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.900
- What do you mean?
- You know, how are you?
Are the kids okay?

39:20.900 --> 39:23.734
No, I smeared them with honey
and I tied them to
a red ant hill.

39:23.734 --> 39:26.800
- Did you get some money?
- Hey. Who are you?

39:26.800 --> 39:28.934
Where's that
other broad, uh, Mona?

39:28.934 --> 39:31.033
Um, not yet.
There's a problem.

39:31.033 --> 39:33.200
Why? What'd they do, fire you?
( chuckles )

39:33.200 --> 39:35.533
I'm Sue Ellen.
I work for Rose.
Can I help you?

39:35.533 --> 39:37.900
Yeah, I need a copy
of the Bob's Big Boy
account figures.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.367
Swell, what are you
gonna do?

39:39.367 --> 39:41.367
This Clown Dog shit's
gone, man.

39:41.367 --> 39:42.934
Look, what do you
want me to do?

39:42.934 --> 39:44.934
We have a receding
profit margin.

39:44.934 --> 39:47.000
Yo, Gidget.
Could you get on it?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.133
I can't right now.
I'm on an important
phone call.

39:49.133 --> 39:50.300
Sue Ellen,
if you didn't get the money,

39:50.300 --> 39:51.767
then why the hell
did you call?

39:51.767 --> 39:54.166
Hey, look,
I don't have all day.

39:54.166 --> 39:55.934
Kenny, hold on.

39:57.433 --> 39:59.700
What is your name
and what do you do here?

39:59.700 --> 40:02.233
I'm Bruce.
I'm head inventory clerk.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.533
Why?

40:03.533 --> 40:04.867
Well, Bruce,

40:04.867 --> 40:07.467
I'm the executive-level
administrative assistant,

40:07.467 --> 40:09.533
and when I get
those figures ready,

40:09.533 --> 40:13.800
I'll give you a buzz
and you can run on up here
and fetch them, all right?

40:13.800 --> 40:15.600
( exhales )

40:15.600 --> 40:18.767
Yeah, sure.
( neck cracks )

40:18.767 --> 40:20.900
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.300
Look, I just called
to say hi.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.266
Aren't you busy
at your career?

40:27.266 --> 40:29.400
I'm in between
important meetings.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.600
I'm so sorry
I disturbed you, Kenny.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.433
Well, you did!
We're busy.

40:33.433 --> 40:36.233
- Fine! Screw you!
- Up yours!

40:36.233 --> 40:37.834
Ugh!

40:37.834 --> 40:39.400
Bitch.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.000
Such a punk.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.734
( phone ringing )

40:45.233 --> 40:46.533
What?!

40:48.667 --> 40:50.233
Oh.

40:50.233 --> 40:52.367
How you doing, Mom?

40:52.367 --> 40:54.533
Yeah. No,
everything's great.

40:55.633 --> 40:57.300
No, Mrs. Sturak's
not here.

40:57.300 --> 41:01.200
She, um-- she went
to the yarn store.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.100
Yeah, she's crocheting
this massive doily
for the couch.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.667
Um, I--

41:07.667 --> 41:09.433
I gotta go, Mom.

41:11.934 --> 41:14.867
Hey, babe.
Who's the void
in Lindsey's office?

41:14.867 --> 41:16.500
- ( sprays )
- ( scoffs )

41:16.500 --> 41:18.834
She applied for
the receptionist job.

41:18.834 --> 41:21.700
Suddenly,
she's an executive?

41:21.700 --> 41:23.033
I don't get it.

41:23.033 --> 41:24.900
- Man on TV: Ready, go.
- Walter: Genie.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.633
- Betty White: Where you park
your car at night.
- Woman: Garage.

41:26.633 --> 41:28.133
- ( dings )
- Betty: First, run, then a...

41:28.133 --> 41:29.867
- Gallop.
- ( sighs )

41:29.867 --> 41:31.734
- Betty: You buy-- you go
to the supermarket...
- Groceries.

41:31.734 --> 41:33.200
- Betty: ...and you
pack up a lot of...
- Woman: Groceries!

41:33.200 --> 41:34.834
Do you ever go outside?

41:34.834 --> 41:36.934
Nah. No TV.

41:36.934 --> 41:38.800
- No prizes.
- ( buzzer sounds )

41:38.800 --> 41:41.834
Man:
All right, gentlemen.
You've got it.

41:41.834 --> 41:45.333
- ...who do not want...
- When you're gonna
do a cake,

41:45.333 --> 41:47.867
you really have to have
a battle plan all ready

41:47.867 --> 41:49.934
so that when you start in,

41:49.934 --> 41:52.000
- you can just go
right through the cake.
- Oh.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.367
You don't wanna go out
and play croquet in the middle,
for instance.

41:55.367 --> 41:58.166
Swell:
Okay, I'll give her
the message. Bye.

41:59.367 --> 42:01.633
Oh, Cathy,
thank you so much.

42:01.633 --> 42:04.000
Oh, no, Sue Ellen.
Thank you!

42:04.000 --> 42:05.400
Really!

42:08.300 --> 42:12.066
Sue Ellen, why don't
you call Cy and Manny
and order in lunch for us?

42:12.066 --> 42:14.133
The naked shrimp
is to die from.

42:14.133 --> 42:15.900
- Right. Yum.
- They'll deliver.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.600
You can pay
out of petty cash.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.033
Petty cash?

42:19.033 --> 42:21.533
Yeah. Cash box is in
your locked bottom drawer.

42:21.533 --> 42:23.200
There should be plenty.

42:23.200 --> 42:26.400
By the way, you can

42:26.400 --> 42:28.533
We work such hellish hours
around here,

42:28.533 --> 42:31.033
no one has time
to go to the bank.

42:31.033 --> 42:32.934
Guard it with your life

42:32.934 --> 42:34.533
and just leave receipts
for whatever you take.

42:34.533 --> 42:36.367
- I'll authorize it, okay?
- Okay.

42:37.700 --> 42:38.600
Is this for me?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.533
This is exquisite.

42:47.533 --> 42:50.133

- Hi, Zach.

43:40.867 --> 43:41.934
Hey.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.433
What's wrong?

43:47.433 --> 43:49.600
Me and Cynthia are
having some problems.

43:51.300 --> 43:53.367
I think she likes
Jacob better.

43:53.367 --> 43:56.000
Ah, maybe she's just trying
to make you jealous.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.233
Maybe.

43:58.467 --> 44:00.300
Oh, here.

44:00.300 --> 44:03.033
There's an article in here
on game playing, okay?

44:03.033 --> 44:05.567
I really think
that you should read it.

44:05.567 --> 44:08.767
- Oh, take the quiz
afterwards, okay?
- Okay.

44:08.767 --> 44:11.500
Check it out, dudes.
Elvis, I'm gonna
get you high.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.633
- ( Elvis grunts )
- ( chuckles )

44:12.633 --> 44:14.467
( squeaks )

44:18.533 --> 44:20.700
( music blaring )

44:23.734 --> 44:26.166
( sighs )

44:26.166 --> 44:27.700
( bass thumping )

44:32.633 --> 44:34.333
( sighs )

44:34.333 --> 44:36.667
- Boy: Whoa, look at his eyes.
- Boy #2: Oh, dude!

44:40.000 --> 44:42.133
Kenny, could you
turn the music down?

44:42.133 --> 44:44.467
- Kenny!
- What?

44:44.467 --> 44:45.900
( whines )

44:45.900 --> 44:48.266
I have been working.
I've had a very rough day.

44:48.266 --> 44:50.367
Could you turn
the music down?

44:50.367 --> 44:52.300
It's down, cave lady.

44:54.633 --> 44:57.567
Kenny, why don't you save
your last three brain cells?

44:57.567 --> 44:59.166
I mean,
what if you need them?

44:59.166 --> 45:01.066
- I won't.
- ( Elvis whines )

45:01.066 --> 45:03.000
( volume increases )

45:03.000 --> 45:04.100
That's right.

45:04.100 --> 45:05.433
You'll never need them

45:05.433 --> 45:07.567
because there's always
gonna be some jerk around

45:07.567 --> 45:09.400
stupid enough
to take care of you.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.367
What is your problem?

45:11.367 --> 45:12.533
Both: Yeah.

45:12.533 --> 45:14.734
You couldn't even
mow the lawn today.

45:14.734 --> 45:16.734
- ( scoffs )
- You're worthless.

45:16.734 --> 45:18.166
I am doing everything,

45:18.166 --> 45:20.900
and I'm trying to
get ready for a date.

45:20.900 --> 45:23.800
When are you
gonna start helping me,
you lazy little punk?

45:24.934 --> 45:27.900
( whines )

45:27.900 --> 45:30.767
- PMS city, man.
- ( laughs )

45:30.767 --> 45:32.700
( screeching )

45:49.066 --> 45:50.667
- ( Bryan chuckles )
- Ah!

45:55.300 --> 45:56.700
God, that's cold!

45:57.967 --> 46:00.767
So, Bryan,
when do the grunion run?

46:00.767 --> 46:02.734
Right about now.

46:02.734 --> 46:04.133
They get washed up here
on the shore

46:04.133 --> 46:06.500
after the highest tide
of the full moon.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.633
Or the new moon.

46:08.967 --> 46:11.000
Anyway,
the girl grunion, right,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
she comes and lays
her eggs in the sand,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.400
and then the guy grunion,
he comes and fertilizes them.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.767
So, they don't, like,
do it together?

46:18.767 --> 46:20.967
Nope, not like us.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.333
I mean like humans.

46:26.333 --> 46:27.633
Oh.

46:27.633 --> 46:29.100
So, you wanna go over there
and watch for them?

46:29.100 --> 46:30.600
'Cause it happens
really fast.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.000
Sure.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.033
So, you going
to college or what?

46:34.033 --> 46:36.333
- I mean, what do you wanna do?
- ( chuckles ) Oh, God.

46:36.333 --> 46:37.967
( sighs )
I don't know.

46:37.967 --> 46:40.700
I'm supposed to register
at City College.

46:40.700 --> 46:44.400
You know, maybe take some
fashion design classes
or something.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.800
What about you?

46:45.800 --> 46:48.033
My parents want me
to go to UCSD.

46:48.033 --> 46:50.467
They have a really good
oceanography program there.

46:50.467 --> 46:52.033
Well, that's cool.

46:52.033 --> 46:54.033
Yeah,
but I'm not so sure.

46:54.033 --> 46:57.266
I mean, I figured
I'd keep saving up
for it anyway, you know?

46:57.266 --> 46:59.934
It's the only reason
I'm still at Clown Dog
after nine months.

46:59.934 --> 47:01.266
Mm.

47:01.266 --> 47:02.834
You know,
it's funny.

47:02.834 --> 47:04.333
I always thought
that my parents had

47:04.333 --> 47:07.000
this big college fund
for me somewhere,
you know?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
( chuckles )
Yeah, me, too.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.166
But I guess that's only
on the savings and loan
commercials, you know?

47:12.166 --> 47:15.967
It's like I don't know
if I want oceanography
to be my life, you know?

47:15.967 --> 47:18.734
I mean, I love it.
I love it.

47:18.734 --> 47:20.500
But it's like
once you decide
on something,

47:20.500 --> 47:21.834
it's all planned out.

47:21.834 --> 47:24.166
Yeah, it's like
all of a sudden,
anything that you do

47:24.166 --> 47:26.100
means that
that's your life.

47:26.100 --> 47:29.133
( scoffs ) I'm not even sure
what the hell I want
my life to be yet.

47:29.133 --> 47:32.166
And then you're
stuck in this plan
because you decided, you know?

47:32.166 --> 47:34.633
And then
you're old or older.

47:34.633 --> 47:36.333
I don't know.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.800
I guess I'm
just stalling, you know?

47:43.166 --> 47:44.166
What?

47:44.166 --> 47:46.400
( chuckles )
Nothing.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.667
I just know
what you mean.

47:50.734 --> 47:52.600
Yeah,
this is always, uh...

47:52.600 --> 47:55.467
Yeah,
I hate this part.

47:55.467 --> 47:57.600
I mean,
I like this part,

47:57.600 --> 48:00.266
but-- oh, God.
( sighs )

48:00.266 --> 48:01.667
No, it's okay.
Come here.

48:04.300 --> 48:06.700
( laughs )

48:06.700 --> 48:08.934
No, forget it.
I ruined the moment.

48:08.934 --> 48:10.734
- No, no.
No, I ruined it.
- Forget it.

48:10.734 --> 48:11.867
'Cause I talked
about it, you know?

48:11.867 --> 48:13.200
When you talk,
you ruin it.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.400
And you can't talk,
and that's just not...

It's office money.
It's called petty cash.

But my paycheck's gonna be
for, like, over $1,000.

49:09.967 --> 49:11.567

Well, we're not

A few months.

We agreed
we're not exclusive.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.800
- Oh.
- Yeah.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.967
I date other women.

classical music?

50:58.433 --> 51:01.000
I played some cello
in my high school orchestra.

Oh!
( chuckles )

51:03.367 --> 51:05.233
Oh.
( chuckles )

51:06.667 --> 51:08.900
Do people always tell you
how young you look?

51:08.900 --> 51:11.367
No, not usually.

51:11.367 --> 51:14.367
I'd ask how old you are,
but most women don't
really like that.

51:14.367 --> 51:16.133
No, we don't.

51:16.133 --> 51:17.367
It baffles me.

51:17.367 --> 51:19.367
I mean,
a woman gets older.

51:19.367 --> 51:21.333
She matures.

51:21.333 --> 51:23.300
She ripens.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.367
Juices start flowing.

51:25.367 --> 51:26.934

51:26.934 --> 51:28.734

Would you like
something from the bar?

It's a special
occasion.

51:32.767 --> 51:34.000
All right.

51:35.166 --> 51:37.667
I'd like a Martini & Rossi
on the rocks.

51:37.667 --> 51:39.200
Ah, yes.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.433
Sweet or dry?

51:40.433 --> 51:42.100
What?

51:42.100 --> 51:44.133
Sweet or dry?

51:44.133 --> 51:46.767
Um, oh,
just a little bit of both.

51:48.266 --> 51:49.934
And for you, sir?

51:49.934 --> 51:52.000
A white wine spritzer.

51:56.467 --> 51:57.867
What's the special
occasion?

51:59.100 --> 52:00.667
It's our
first lunch together.

52:00.667 --> 52:02.500
Oh.

52:02.500 --> 52:07.000
This will give us a chance
to break down some of those
corporate barriers.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.467
- Right.
- And by the end of lunch,

52:08.467 --> 52:10.767
we'll probably be sharing
our intimate histories,

52:10.767 --> 52:13.433
stories about
our first time.

52:13.433 --> 52:16.667
Next thing you know,
we'll be sharing a cigarette
in post-coital bliss.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.367
Are you talking
about us having sex?

52:18.367 --> 52:21.400
Hey, hold on. Slow down.
You're moving too fast for me.

52:21.400 --> 52:23.300
But if that's an area
of interest to you,
it can be arranged.

52:23.300 --> 52:26.467
And if it doesn't,
I was kidding.

52:26.467 --> 52:28.066
The rosemary chicken
is delicious here.

52:29.333 --> 52:30.633
Very tender.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.934

for lunch.

52:40.300 --> 52:41.633

52:50.000 --> 52:52.834
Now she's
kissing up to Gus?

52:52.834 --> 52:56.333

that conniving
little snot!

Here's another one.

52:57.967 --> 53:00.700
In Minneapolis, an 11th-grader
beat up a schoolmate

leather jacket and
pair of Fiorucci jeans.

53:04.166 --> 53:07.200
I just don't think
that kids are gonna
wanna wear uniforms.

53:07.200 --> 53:10.400
I mean, don't you think
that they're kind of plain,
kind of boring?

53:10.400 --> 53:14.300
Frankly, it's not
up to the students
to decide.

53:14.300 --> 53:17.266
Next week, I'll sit
the superintendent
of schools down

53:17.266 --> 53:19.133
over eggs Florentine,

53:19.133 --> 53:22.333
and I'll convince him that
mandatory school uniforms

53:22.333 --> 53:25.000
are necessary for the safety
of our school children.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.233
Not to mention
boosting GAW sales.

53:27.233 --> 53:29.367
It'll be
absolutely perfect.

53:29.367 --> 53:32.800
I don't know.
I mean, kids like
to wear stuff that's them.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.033
And my high school
was like a fashion show.

53:35.033 --> 53:37.133
Well, sure.
Back then, it was safe.

53:37.133 --> 53:39.433
But times,
they are a-changing.

53:39.433 --> 53:42.266
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It was a long time ago.

53:42.266 --> 53:43.533
Let's stop.

53:43.533 --> 53:45.934
I'm exhausted,
and I'm late to meet Gus.

53:45.934 --> 53:48.000
What's the deal
with you and him?

53:48.000 --> 53:52.333
Well, we've been
mutually unexclusive

53:52.333 --> 53:53.900
for the last
seven months.

53:53.900 --> 53:56.867
I mean, I brought up
the cohabitation topic recently,

53:56.867 --> 53:59.233
and we gave it
some serious thought.

53:59.233 --> 54:02.400
We decided it would be
more practical and convenient

54:02.400 --> 54:05.767
if we maintained
separate space.

54:05.767 --> 54:08.467
Which basically means
he isn't ready to commit.

54:08.467 --> 54:10.033
But you know
how they are.

54:10.033 --> 54:12.100
They're all little boys
pretending to be men, right?

54:12.100 --> 54:14.700
Yeah, all the guys
that I've dated
have been boys.

54:14.700 --> 54:17.433
Precisely.
The Peter Pan syndrome.

54:17.433 --> 54:20.934
God, I really need
to get away.

54:20.934 --> 54:23.133
Gus has been trying
to talk me into

54:23.133 --> 54:25.633
this wild, dirty weekend
in Santa Barbara.

54:25.633 --> 54:28.066
And I really wanna go,

54:28.066 --> 54:29.700
but I don't want him
to know that,

54:29.700 --> 54:32.934
so I haven't been
too enthusiastic about it.

54:32.934 --> 54:34.800
Oh, yeah.
I know how that goes.

54:34.800 --> 54:39.433
But tonight, I think
I'll start letting him
try and persuade me.

54:39.433 --> 54:40.834
Well, that'll do it.

54:40.834 --> 54:42.500
( chuckles )

54:42.500 --> 54:45.200
Why don't you go on home
and have a glass of wine

54:45.200 --> 54:47.066
and put some cucumber slices
on your eyes?

54:47.066 --> 54:48.200
You'll feel much better.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.567
Well, I'm all out
of cucumbers.

54:50.567 --> 54:52.200
Oh, Sue Ellen,

54:52.200 --> 54:55.834
every girl over 25
should have a cucumber
in the house.

Bryan, come on.

You have to be over 21.

Bryan:
Oh, yeah. A drag.
Hey, I'm off tomorrow.

56:36.367 --> 56:38.200
I'm gonna go to the beach
with some buddies.
You wanna come?

I've got work.

56:40.066 --> 56:41.934

Hey, you wanna go

tomorrow night?

56:45.633 --> 56:47.000
Yeah, that sounds good.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.867

and her boyfriend
got some extra tickets.

I can't.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.667
I just remembered
I hate baseball.

56:55.767 --> 56:56.867
You hate baseball?

56:58.266 --> 57:01.266
Okay. Well, then we'll
just do something else.

57:01.266 --> 57:03.700
- Just the two of us.
- Okay, good.

57:03.700 --> 57:06.200
So, I'll pick you up
at work around,
what, 6:00?

57:06.200 --> 57:07.900
Uh, no.
Don't do that.

57:07.900 --> 57:09.266
I'll just call you
when I get home.

57:09.266 --> 57:11.900
( chuckles )
Swell, what's going on?

57:11.900 --> 57:14.433
Nothing.
Going out
tomorrow night's great.

57:14.433 --> 57:16.433
Yeah, well,
then why won't you
tell me where you work?

57:16.433 --> 57:18.333
What, are you doing
something illegal?

57:18.333 --> 57:20.066
Are you working
for the mob?

57:20.066 --> 57:21.600
No.

57:21.600 --> 57:24.800
I, um, just don't
want you to know, okay?

57:24.800 --> 57:27.734
Well, what if I wanted
to send you flowers
or something?

57:27.734 --> 57:30.066
Well, you could
send them to the house.

57:30.066 --> 57:31.800
Well, who'd sign
for them?

57:31.800 --> 57:34.166
- One of the kids.
- And what if they're not here?

57:34.166 --> 57:37.667
- I mean, why are you
making this so complicated?
- Then don't send me flowers.

57:37.667 --> 57:40.433
I just wanna know what it is
you do all day, that's all.

57:40.433 --> 57:42.467
Oh, come on.
Drop it.

57:42.467 --> 57:44.600
Stop acting
like Henry VIII.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.800
Look,
just forget it, okay?

57:46.800 --> 57:48.767
I'm sorry I cared,
really.

57:48.767 --> 57:51.200
Well, that's
a shitty thing to say.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.967
You're just pissed off
because I don't wanna
meet your sister.

57:53.967 --> 57:57.133
Swell, who cares
about my sister?

57:57.133 --> 57:59.700
I mean, all I said
was that she's been
in a major slump lately

57:59.700 --> 58:01.266
'cause of that backstabber
at her office.

58:01.266 --> 58:03.533
How do you know this woman
is a backstabber?

58:03.533 --> 58:05.433
Maybe she's nice, Bryan.

58:05.433 --> 58:07.433
Why do you have to be
so judgmental about her?

58:07.433 --> 58:10.166
Look, Swell,
what's up with you, huh?

58:11.767 --> 58:14.633
I mean, are-- are you
seeing someone else or what?

58:14.633 --> 58:16.600
'Cause, I mean,
that's what it sounds like.

58:16.600 --> 58:18.900
You know,
I mean, if you're seeing
some other guy or something,

58:18.900 --> 58:20.533
you don't have
to do all this.

58:20.533 --> 58:22.800
You could just tell me.
Just be honest.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.133
No, there is
nobody else, okay?

58:26.667 --> 58:29.533
I just wish that
you could respect
my privacy, that's all.

58:29.533 --> 58:32.300
Yeah, well,
I'd respect your privacy
if you weren't so secretive.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.166
Well, I'd tell you more

know so much.

letting him cool off.

I'll call him in a few weeks
when all this is over.

01:01:22.066 --> 01:01:25.233
I can just go to the beach
and take a towel
and a Walkman

01:01:25.233 --> 01:01:27.066
and lie in the sand

01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:28.667

01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.667

interface with anybody,

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:31.834

The superintendent
needs cost estimates
from us by Wednesday.

This is going to triple
our profit margin,

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:55.000
and we'll finally, finally
prove ourselves to New York.

who might they be from?

They're for you.

our weekend away
in Santa Barbara

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.333
was the turning point
for us.

Look at me.
I'm glowing!

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.967
The man makes me glow.
Am I glowing?

01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:22.567
Yeah, you're
a little bit shiny.

01:03:22.567 --> 01:03:25.700
Oh, God.
I feel like a teenager.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.333
Oh, um,
here are your messages.

01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:29.767
Great. Thanks.

01:03:29.767 --> 01:03:31.734
Well, I'm gonna go glow
in my office.

01:03:31.734 --> 01:03:33.667
( laughing )

01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:38.033
( exhales )

01:03:38.033 --> 01:03:40.500
I stole her resume
from personnel,

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.934
checked her out.

01:03:41.934 --> 01:03:45.066
Now, I had a feeling
none of these companies
ever heard of her.

01:03:45.066 --> 01:03:46.767
I'm going to Rose.

01:03:46.767 --> 01:03:48.967
Yeah, but wait a minute.
The void's getting by.

01:03:48.967 --> 01:03:51.133
- Shh.
- ( people chattering )

01:03:51.133 --> 01:03:53.367
( whirring )

01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:54.967
And Rose loves her.

01:03:54.967 --> 01:03:56.266
She's not gonna care.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:58.767
You've got to get something
better on her than that.

01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:03.533
I mean, what did she do,
copy it from a resume book?

01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:05.400
( doorbell rings )

01:04:07.367 --> 01:04:10.400
Crandell house?
We got your home
entertainment center.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.900
Yeah! Uh, set it up
right over there.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.000
Man on phone: The vote
on the uniform issue's
been pushed up.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.900
I need those
cost estimates today.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:21.033
Robert, I don't see there being
any dilemma with that at all.

01:04:21.033 --> 01:04:23.033
We'll messenger them
right over.

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:27.066
Sue Ellen, how are
the cost estimates for
the superintendent coming?

01:04:27.066 --> 01:04:28.500
He needs them
this afternoon.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.500
I'm right on top
of that, Rose.

01:04:42.233 --> 01:04:44.033
Hi. Where's Cathy?

01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:46.533
I don't know.
I'm a temp.

01:04:46.533 --> 01:04:47.700
Can I help you?

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:52.433
- She doesn't wanna go
to the baseball game.
- Bryan, just call her.

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:54.200
- ( coughing )
- Call her.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.033
Oh, hi, Carolyn.
I'm sick.

01:04:58.033 --> 01:04:59.867
Um, this is
a QED report.

01:04:59.867 --> 01:05:02.066
I promised Sue Ellen
I'd do it for her.

01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:04.767
Could you see that she gets it?
It's really important.

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.300
- ( coughs ) Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.734
Bryan:
I don't know, Carol.

01:05:09.734 --> 01:05:11.967
I don't know why,
but she's keeping
things from me.

01:05:11.967 --> 01:05:14.100
I think it's this other guy,
but I don't know.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.934
Maybe I should just do
something crazy, you know,

01:05:15.934 --> 01:05:17.900
like just go and, like,
sweep her off her feet.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.233
Bry, just forget
about her.

01:05:20.233 --> 01:05:23.200
She's not worth it.
You deserve better than that.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.934
Is there a problem,
Sue Ellen?

01:05:31.567 --> 01:05:33.300
( sighs )

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.734
Sue Ellen.

01:05:34.734 --> 01:05:36.600
Gus. Hi.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.200
Don't say anything.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.500
- I understand.
- What do you understand?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.967
Well, now, either
the scenario is

01:05:44.967 --> 01:05:49.834
that you want to
politely thank me
for the roses,

01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:53.900
or you-- you burst in here
wanting to be impulsive

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.633
and ask me to, uh,

01:05:56.633 --> 01:05:59.200
go to Carmel with you
this weekend.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.633
Sure.

01:06:00.633 --> 01:06:02.400
We'll fly.
I have my pilot's license.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.834
Gus, maybe I gave you
the wrong idea,

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.500
but I'm not
interested in you.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.533
Then why did you
burst through my door

01:06:07.533 --> 01:06:10.233
so determined,
so eager?

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:12.166
Gus, why are you
doing this to Rose?

01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:15.600
( chuckles )
Hey, look, I'm kidding!

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.400
Hold on,
maybe I gave you
the wrong idea.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.266
Why don't we just start
with the symphony?

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.800
I'm not starting
anything with you.

01:06:22.233 --> 01:06:23.333
( door closes )

01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:25.100
Thanks, guys! Bye.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.266
Any time.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.767
Awesome.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.900
Hey, Scruff,
I say next batch

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.367
we do more
mocha Swiss amaretto ones.

01:06:58.367 --> 01:06:59.700
Mocha Swiss, got it.

01:07:01.133 --> 01:07:02.667
Kenny?

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:04.333
- Mocha...
- Kenny, I need you!

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.066
Gourmet munchies, man.

01:07:06.066 --> 01:07:07.166
Come help!

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:10.767
Something's wrong
with the TV antenna.

01:07:10.767 --> 01:07:12.033
I'm in a meeting.

01:07:12.033 --> 01:07:14.800
( coughing )
Uh, have Bob Barker help you.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.100
( door closes )

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:21.000
( birds chirping )

01:07:31.767 --> 01:07:33.000
( sighs )

01:07:38.734 --> 01:07:40.767
Hey, Scruff.
Go long.

01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:43.367
Oh. Thanks.
Awesome.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.433
( grunting )

01:07:53.433 --> 01:07:56.433
- ( thudding )
- What is that sound, dude?

01:07:56.433 --> 01:07:57.867
There's something
up there, man.

01:08:13.467 --> 01:08:15.433
Whoa!

01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:16.433
Help!

01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:18.433
- Somebody help me!
- Whoa.

01:08:18.433 --> 01:08:20.633
( screams, grunts )

01:08:22.066 --> 01:08:22.966
- ( grunts )
- Dude!

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.265
Walter!

01:08:26.265 --> 01:08:28.133
Ow!

01:08:30.367 --> 01:08:31.899
Holy shit.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.533
Oh, Sue Ellen.

01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:38.033
- Paycheck.
- Thank you.

01:08:38.033 --> 01:08:40.233
( chatter )

01:08:42.567 --> 01:08:44.133
( sighs )

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.200
Sue Ellen,
where have you been?

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.934
Where's the QED report?

01:08:50.934 --> 01:08:55.399
- Rose, I-- I tried--
- Carolyn: Ah, yes,
the QED report.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.200
I have that
for you, Rose.

01:08:58.332 --> 01:08:59.867
What are you doing
with it?

01:08:59.867 --> 01:09:02.000
Sue Ellen,
what is Carolyn
doing with it?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.966
Cathy Henderson
brought it by.

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.332
Seems she's been
covering for Sue Ellen,
doing her work for her.

01:09:07.332 --> 01:09:09.533
You let Cathy do
the QED report?

01:09:09.533 --> 01:09:10.867
Uh-huh.

01:09:16.066 --> 01:09:18.899
I was wondering
how you were gonna get that

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:21.466
and the research for
the school presentation done.

01:09:21.466 --> 01:09:25.100
Bravo.
You really know how
to delegate responsibility.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.000
Carolyn, you wanna be
executive material?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.033
Keep an eye
on Sue Ellen.

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:33.166
You-- you are a paragon.

01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:35.367
( phone ringing )

01:09:35.367 --> 01:09:36.667
Ooh.

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:38.800
- Oh.
- Rose.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.300
Lunch?

01:09:41.433 --> 01:09:43.300
General Apparel West.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.500
- Thanks for the roses.
- She's really busy right now.
Can I take a message?

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.966
- Is this a joke?
- Don't mention it.

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:51.567
Sue Ellen?
River Ridge Hospital's
on line three.

01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:53.066
There's an emergency
with your son.

01:09:53.066 --> 01:09:54.800
Oh, my son.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.567
- Your son?
- Her son?

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.800
Hello?

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.000
Uh, yes,
this is Mrs. Crandell.

01:10:02.367 --> 01:10:03.800
What?!

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.300
Oh, my God.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.700
Okay, okay,
I'll be right there.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.700
Will you please tell him
I will be right there?

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.667
All right.
Thank you.

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.000
Are you all right?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.367
Uh, yeah.
I hope so.

01:10:14.367 --> 01:10:15.834
I didn't know
you were married.

01:10:15.834 --> 01:10:18.000
Um, I'm not.
I'm divorced.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.266
It's-- it's a painful memory.
I don't like to talk about it.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.600
Hi. Um, I'm looking
for Walter Crandell.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.767
You called
about 20 minutes--

01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:38.300
Swell, I don't know
if he's okay.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.100
He's in with the doctor
right now.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.433
He better be okay.

01:10:41.433 --> 01:10:42.934
- Okay, okay, what happened?
- I'm sorry.

01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:44.567
Mrs. Crandell.

01:10:44.567 --> 01:10:46.400
I'm Dr. Permutter.
Here he is.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.500
Oh, my God. Yeah, hi.
I'm-- I'm Mrs. Crandell.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.834
- Hi.
- Walter's mom.

01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:52.400
How is he?
What happened?

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.400
Walter, how do you feel, honey?
Are you okay?

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.867
It's a clean break.
It should heal nicely.

01:10:56.867 --> 01:10:59.200
I fell off the roof.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.934
What was he doing
on the roof, Kenny?

01:11:01.934 --> 01:11:04.033
I wasn't there.
I should've been.

01:11:04.033 --> 01:11:06.333
Well, I mean, not on the roof,
but I should've been with him,

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:08.133
taking care of him,

01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:11.400
reading "Green Eggs and Ham"
or some shit like that.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.767
Walt, man,
I'm really sorry.

01:11:13.767 --> 01:11:15.967
You'll have to bring him back
for a walking cast

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:17.934
in about six weeks.

01:11:17.934 --> 01:11:20.734
Have him take one of those
if he has any pain.

01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:23.834
Walt, we'll stop and get you
an ice cream cone, okay?

01:11:23.834 --> 01:11:26.233
That doesn't make up
for your irresponsibility.

01:11:26.233 --> 01:11:28.500
Look, I screwed up!

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.200
I'm sorry.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.967
Is he your son, too?

01:11:32.967 --> 01:11:35.500
Uh, no.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.100
He's my stepson.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.233
Yeah, that's why we don't
get along so well.

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:42.100
Well, we better
get on home for supper.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.734
I'm making pot roast.
It's Walter's favorite.

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:46.000
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.700
Chop, chop!

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.367
Take it easy, now.

01:11:49.367 --> 01:11:50.633
Help your brother.

01:11:50.633 --> 01:11:52.200
I can't believe
you let this happen to him.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.300
- Go to hell.
- Damn it, Kenny. Ugh!

01:12:02.834 --> 01:12:05.033
- Shit.
- What?

01:12:05.033 --> 01:12:07.967
My check
is only for $735.

01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:10.367
I thought you were getting,
like, over a grand.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.600
Taxes. They took half
of my money away for taxes.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.300
- And some savings
and pension plan.
- ( scoffs )

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.033
- ( TV playing )
- Well, at least
I made enough

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:20.934
to cover what we spent
in petty cash.

01:12:20.934 --> 01:12:22.133
Walter,
how you doing?

01:12:22.133 --> 01:12:23.333
Hey, "Hollywood Squares"
are on.

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.133
Hey, bitchin'!

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:32.200
Man on TV:
Sunlight has
real lemon juice.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.166
Where'd this come from?

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:37.500
Japan.
It's state of the art.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.367
Well, yeah,
it's really nice,

01:12:39.367 --> 01:12:42.967
but, uh, where'd you get
the money for something
so state of the art?

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.633
Well, it was
petty cash money.

01:12:44.633 --> 01:12:46.633
You were spending
petty cash money.

01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:49.700
Zach, I bought
a pair of boots
and a magazine!

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.800
You bought a home
entertainment center?

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.467
It's Walter's idea.

01:12:53.467 --> 01:12:54.900
Well, it's going back.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.567
We can't take it back.
We got it on sale.

01:12:57.567 --> 01:13:00.400
It wasn't your money.
It was my money.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.834
Oh, well, now,
it wasn't really
your money either.

01:13:02.834 --> 01:13:04.600
You embezzled it.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.300
I did not embezzle it.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.800
I borrowed it.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.800
And I was gonna put it back
after my next paycheck,

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.467
but we can't afford
all this.

01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:14.900
How could you do this?

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.266
You would never
steal from Mom.

01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:19.633
That's because Mom
never had that much.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.934
There's only $30 left.

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:28.100
Well, you should see
the Zsa Zsa diamond ring
he bought for Cynthia.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.800
You bought her
a diamond?

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.233
- How much was it, Zach?
- It was a chip.

01:13:34.233 --> 01:13:36.266
- Well, get it back from her.
- Diamonds are forever.

01:13:36.266 --> 01:13:38.100
Melissa:
Hey, and I needed
a new bike.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.567
And I got Walter
the new home edition
of "Super Password"

01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:42.300
and Elvis
a new chew toy.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.633
You have spent
over $3,000?

01:13:47.867 --> 01:13:49.900
You're grounded.
You are all grounded.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.266
How could you
steal from me?

01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:54.233
Well, now,
they didn't really steal.

01:13:54.233 --> 01:13:55.567
They borrowed.

01:13:55.567 --> 01:13:57.767
They were just following
your irresponsible example.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.600
Oh, shut up, Kenny.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.000
I am in deep shit!

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.333
Quit your job.
Get out while you can.

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:05.533
I'm an embezzler.

01:14:05.533 --> 01:14:07.400
They're gonna
throw me in prison.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.734
Nah, the judge will
probably go easy on you
considering you're a minor.

01:14:10.734 --> 01:14:12.934
I'm not gonna give up.

01:14:12.934 --> 01:14:14.767
We'll just economize.

01:14:14.767 --> 01:14:18.100
I'll keep working.
I'll work overtime
if I have to.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.934
A few more paychecks,
I'll be able to put it back,
and no one's gonna know, right?

01:14:21.934 --> 01:14:23.233
I'm innocent.

01:14:26.033 --> 01:14:27.633
GAW is history.

01:14:27.633 --> 01:14:29.767
- We're all gonna be
out of a job.
- What?!

01:14:29.767 --> 01:14:31.700
The school board
rejected it.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700
You were right,
Sue Ellen.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.767
The students
got wind of it last night

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:37.567
and held a huge protest.

01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:40.233
They burned uniforms
in effigy.

01:14:40.233 --> 01:14:41.834
This was our last hope.

01:14:41.834 --> 01:14:44.834
( sighs )
We're probably all
gonna be canned tomorrow.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.333
Well, listen, Rose.
Can't you call New York?

01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:51.633
I mean, convince them
to give us a little bit
more time

01:14:51.633 --> 01:14:52.633
so we can keep working?

01:14:52.633 --> 01:14:53.700
Oh, why bother?

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.033
It's not
the end of the world.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.166
- It's just a job.
- But, Rose, I need this job.

01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:00.700
And, Rose, um...

01:15:01.867 --> 01:15:03.734
I have to tell you
I, uh--

01:15:03.734 --> 01:15:05.066
I kind of have
a problem.

01:15:05.066 --> 01:15:07.200
You're not
gonna have a problem.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.734
You're gonna be fine,
believe me.

01:15:09.734 --> 01:15:12.400
With all your qualifications
and background,

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.633
you're gonna land
an even better job.

01:15:14.633 --> 01:15:17.500
And, Sue Ellen,
do me a favor, would you?

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.467
Would you break the news
to Franklin?

01:15:19.467 --> 01:15:21.367
You're so good
at dealing with the staff.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.400
Franklin, believe me.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.433
With your qualifications
and background,

01:15:29.433 --> 01:15:31.100
you'll land
an even better job.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.967
( sobs )

01:15:32.967 --> 01:15:34.600
Thanks, Sue Ellen.

01:15:36.567 --> 01:15:39.000
You've been
a real trouper

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.734
right to the end.

01:15:40.734 --> 01:15:43.433
( sobs )
I'm gonna miss you.

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:56.266
( whirring )

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.467
Rose.

01:16:55.467 --> 01:16:56.900
I have an idea.

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:00.900
Sue Ellen,
this is gonna save
our collective asses.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.834
It's fabulous.

01:17:02.834 --> 01:17:05.233
Now, I don't want New York
to know anything about this

01:17:05.233 --> 01:17:06.734
because they'd never
approve funding.

01:17:06.734 --> 01:17:09.400
So, you'll need to rent
a banquet hall.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.667
You do have enough
from petty cash, right?

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:12.967
Well, um...

01:17:15.033 --> 01:17:17.600
( sighs )
Rose, I have to
tell you something.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.867
Go ahead, honey.

01:17:23.033 --> 01:17:27.033
You know, banquet halls
are so impersonal.

01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:29.333
My house is fabulous.
We can have it there.

01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:30.967
It'll be
absolutely perfect.

01:17:30.967 --> 01:17:33.633
Look, we are
a family of felons.

01:17:33.633 --> 01:17:35.600
Our summer of freedom
is gonna be a winter prison

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.200
if I don't get some help.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.500
Now, I want this place
spick-and-span by
Saturday night

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.100
or I'm turning us all in.

01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.700
Are you with me?

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.367
Hmm?

01:17:44.367 --> 01:17:46.266
Guys, what do you say?

01:17:46.266 --> 01:17:47.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.934
- Come on, what do you say?

01:17:49.934 --> 01:17:51.333

black and white.

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.500

01:20:50.834 --> 01:20:52.166
Zach's at Cynthia's,

01:20:52.166 --> 01:20:54.700
Melissa's upstairs,
and Walter's asleep.

01:20:57.633 --> 01:20:58.633
What's wrong with you?

01:20:58.633 --> 01:21:00.934
Nothing is wrong with me.

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:08.300
Did you
burn something?

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.066
Yeah, well,
maybe if you'd called

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:12.800
and told me
you were gonna be, like,
three and half hours late,

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.033
I could've planned
my dinner better.

01:21:15.033 --> 01:21:16.834
I had to
work late, okay?

01:21:16.834 --> 01:21:18.800
You still
should've called.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.800
I sat and I waited.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.867
I went ahead
and I fed the kids.

01:21:22.867 --> 01:21:25.000
I worked all day
on that casserole.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.967
- Sorry.
- You haven't even said
how nice the house looks.

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:29.333
You're off
at the office all day,

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:31.000
doing interesting
office things,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.934
I'm stuck here cooking
and cleaning and mowing,

01:21:34.934 --> 01:21:36.767
helping Melissa
with her fastball,

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.300
being a role model
for Zach,

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.233
spending quality time
with Walter,

01:21:40.233 --> 01:21:42.133
doing your party shit!

01:21:42.133 --> 01:21:45.433
You've got the car
and you don't even
take me anywhere anymore!

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:48.934
And when was
the last time we went out
to dinner together, huh?

01:21:48.934 --> 01:21:52.233
You know what?
I'm sick and tired
of not being appreciated!

01:21:52.233 --> 01:21:54.200
I appreciate you.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.667
Eat shit!

01:21:57.567 --> 01:21:59.667
I don't believe this.

01:21:59.667 --> 01:22:02.166
I get to get up
at 5:30 every morning

01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:04.166
so I can beat
rush-hour traffic

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:05.834
and go sit behind a desk
for eight hours

01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:09.100
and miss
Oprah Winfrey every day
on my summer vacation.

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.900
And then I get to
drive home in gridlock

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.600
in a Volvo
with no air conditioning

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.967
just so I can
take care of you guys
and put food on the damn table!

01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:20.500
It's a rat race
and it sucks, Kenny.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.667
So, what do you want,
a medal?

01:22:26.967 --> 01:22:28.367
( sighs )

01:22:28.367 --> 01:22:31.233
Now, come on.
You don't have
to do all this.

01:22:31.233 --> 01:22:33.200
I mean, I never asked you
to whisk the couch.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:36.266
Well, it needed it.

01:22:43.967 --> 01:22:45.533
I knew she was a phony.

01:22:45.533 --> 01:22:47.667
I did not think
she was a thief.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.333
Distinctive Valet Parking,

01:22:58.333 --> 01:23:00.033
Classical Accompaniment
musicians.

01:23:00.033 --> 01:23:01.500
Bruce:
KC Catering.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.100
Bodacious Sculptures
in Ice.

01:23:04.767 --> 01:23:07.000
- ( sniffs )
- She didn't steal
from petty cash.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.433
She paid for
the buyers' shindig.

01:23:08.433 --> 01:23:09.533
It's all legit.

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.266
( sighs )
Let's get out of here.

01:23:12.266 --> 01:23:13.333
I give up.

01:23:31.734 --> 01:23:34.367
Bruce:
She's only 17.

01:23:34.367 --> 01:23:36.300
( both chuckling )

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:37.834
Shh.

01:23:40.233 --> 01:23:42.467
Swell:
All right, now don't
be rude to anybody.

01:23:42.467 --> 01:23:44.200
Don't spit on anybody.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.700
And don't wander off,
because I want you to
meet my boss, okay?

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.600
- Yeah, okay.
- And remember,
call me "Mommy."

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.967
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:49.967 --> 01:23:52.066
Let's rehearse it.
Melissa, come here, honey.

01:23:52.066 --> 01:23:53.533
- Okay, Mommy!
- Good!

01:23:53.533 --> 01:23:55.233
Blech. Boo!

01:23:55.233 --> 01:23:57.133
- Hi, Mrs. Crandell.
- Hi, kids.

01:23:57.133 --> 01:23:59.066
Thanks for helping out.

01:23:59.066 --> 01:24:00.533
Uh, where's Kenny?

01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:01.767
Getting ready.

01:24:01.767 --> 01:24:03.600
( exhales )

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.867
Good evening,
Mrs. Crandell.

01:24:06.867 --> 01:24:08.533
Kenny, you look great!

01:24:08.533 --> 01:24:10.033
Oh, that's Kenneth.

01:24:10.033 --> 01:24:12.033
The guests have already
started to arrive.

01:24:12.033 --> 01:24:13.834
All right, everyone,
man your trays.

01:24:13.834 --> 01:24:15.700
Get going there.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.800
Good tray,
good tray.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.500
All right.
Go get 'em, big man.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.867
Better get your ass
out there, Mrs. Crandell.

01:24:26.867 --> 01:24:29.767
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:35.166
( chatter continues )

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.367
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

01:24:39.367 --> 01:24:41.333
Rose, this is
my daughter, Melissa.

01:24:41.333 --> 01:24:43.967
Hi, boss lady.
Creole mushroom?

01:24:43.967 --> 01:24:46.433
Well, hello, Melissa.
No, thanks, not tonight.

01:24:46.433 --> 01:24:49.400
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.200
I love that they're
wearing our uniforms.
Fabulous touch.

01:24:54.667 --> 01:24:56.433
- Oh, yeah.
Look at the jalopy.
- Aw, how cute.

01:24:56.433 --> 01:24:59.800
This is going to be
so much fun.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.900
Oh, yeah.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.900
Hey, yo, mad dog.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.367
You wanna park the car?

01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:05.934
We're on a break,
dude.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.467
Yo, park it yourself,
Metallica breath.

01:25:08.467 --> 01:25:10.700
- Oh, hi!
- Hi, Cathy.

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.700
I brought this Jell-O mold
just in case you needed one.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.033
- Oh, this is
my husband, Howard.
- Hello.

01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:18.266
I love your house.
Oh, wow!

01:25:20.433 --> 01:25:23.133
Swell, take the baked Brie
out of the oven.
It'll caramelize.

01:25:23.133 --> 01:25:24.400
Yes.

01:25:26.633 --> 01:25:29.767
Zachary! Where you been?
You're our maître d'.

01:25:29.767 --> 01:25:32.767
- Cynthia dumped me for Jacob.
- Swell: Oh, honey.

01:25:32.767 --> 01:25:35.033
I'm so sorry.

01:25:35.033 --> 01:25:36.667
I just
don't understand.

01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:38.100
She was
my moon goddess.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.800
Tsk, I know.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.367
Get over it.

01:25:41.367 --> 01:25:42.667
Did you get
the diamond back?

01:25:42.667 --> 01:25:45.467
Kenny,
I'm out of rumaki.

01:25:45.467 --> 01:25:47.433
Let me get that
for ya.

01:25:47.433 --> 01:25:49.266
I'm maître d'.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.000
Uh, excuse me.
Rose?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.734
What is it,
Carolyn?

01:25:57.734 --> 01:25:59.166
Something?

01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:01.567
Since this is
the biggest night
in GAW history,

01:26:01.567 --> 01:26:03.033
I thought you might
like to know

01:26:03.033 --> 01:26:06.467
that this all rests
in the hands of a child.

01:26:06.467 --> 01:26:08.100
A child you hired.

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:11.767
This is, by far and away,

01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:16.600
the most petty, spiteful,
vindictive machination

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.567
you have ever concocted.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.767
Grow up, Carolyn.

01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:26.166
- We're here!
What do you want us to do?
- Hey, hey!

01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:29.033
Oh, great.
Um, why don't you go
up to my room and change,

01:26:29.033 --> 01:26:30.934
and I'll be up there
in a few seconds, okay?

01:26:30.934 --> 01:26:33.166
- Okay.
- This is gonna be great.

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:36.033
( chatter )

01:26:36.033 --> 01:26:37.567
Kenny?

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:38.700
Oh, hey, Nicole.

01:26:40.233 --> 01:26:42.300
Mm.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.800
Oh, Sue Ellen!
I was looking for you.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.934
Great house!

01:26:50.934 --> 01:26:53.233
- Oh, you look lovely.
- Thank you.

01:26:53.233 --> 01:26:56.266
- No, I know you said
you're not interested.
- That's right, I'm not.

01:26:56.266 --> 01:26:57.800
But I understand why.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.400
And I want you to know
I'm not taking this lightly.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.266
Gus, it's just that
I don't think that
it's fair--

01:27:02.266 --> 01:27:05.100
No, I know. I know.
My timing is off.

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.433
And I know you're--
you're just getting
over a divorce and...

01:27:08.433 --> 01:27:11.533
Gus, you can't imagine
how off your timing is.

01:27:11.533 --> 01:27:13.066
Forget it.

01:27:13.066 --> 01:27:15.467
Or we could just have
a wild, sweaty fling.

01:27:15.467 --> 01:27:16.700
What do you think?
( snaps fingers )

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:17.967
( chuckles )

01:27:17.967 --> 01:27:20.166
Gus, you know,

01:27:20.166 --> 01:27:22.100
I think
the scenario here

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.233
is that
you're a sleaze ball.

01:27:24.233 --> 01:27:27.133
Hey! Whoa.
Hey, I was kidding.

01:27:27.133 --> 01:27:28.700
I surrender.

01:27:29.934 --> 01:27:31.433
Wha...?

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.633
What's this?

01:27:35.633 --> 01:27:37.033
What is this?

01:27:37.033 --> 01:27:40.433
Well, uh,
just a little accident.

01:27:41.533 --> 01:27:42.467
Swell:
Uh, Rose, Gus--

01:27:43.734 --> 01:27:46.400
Gus has sort of
a little crush on me.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.300
He's been
coming on to you?

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.700
( scoffs )
Rose, come on.

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.266
You know
how I feel about you.

01:27:53.266 --> 01:27:56.633
You're the one I wanna listen
to beautiful music with.

01:27:56.633 --> 01:27:57.967
You.

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.266
He sent those roses
to me.

01:28:01.266 --> 01:28:03.233
That's not true!

01:28:03.233 --> 01:28:05.400
Rose.
Rose, believe me.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:10.066
Okay, we're all adults here
and we have a presentation
to get through.

01:28:10.066 --> 01:28:13.000
Gus, the buyer from Saks
is looking for you.

01:28:14.567 --> 01:28:17.433
( voice breaks )
Sue Ellen, it's showtime.

01:28:17.433 --> 01:28:19.000
Okay.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.333
( crickets chirping )

01:28:21.333 --> 01:28:22.333
Good evening.

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.400
Thank you.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.600
I'm Rose Lindsey,

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.700
and on behalf
of General Apparel West,

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.300
I'd like
to welcome you.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.600
Now, I'm sure you're all
on the edge of your seats,

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.500
wondering what we have
in store for you.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.667
So, to conduct
our presentation,

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:39.967
I'd like to introduce
to you our hostess,

01:28:39.967 --> 01:28:42.800
our recently named
employee of the month,

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.300
and the woman responsible
for all you're going to
view tonight,

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.100
Sue Ellen Crandell.

01:28:51.467 --> 01:28:52.367
Thank you, Rose.

01:28:53.633 --> 01:28:55.233
Welcome, everyone.

01:28:55.233 --> 01:28:57.200
For 12 years,
General Apparel West

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.000
has enjoyed
a solid reputation

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.400
as the manufacturer
of quality uniforms.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.567
But times,
they are a-changing.

01:29:03.567 --> 01:29:05.600
We're growing,
we're expanding,

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.900
we're approaching
the millennium

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.734
with a fresh attitude
and a fresh look.

01:29:08.734 --> 01:29:10.834
And what we have
for you tonight
is a preview

01:29:10.834 --> 01:29:12.734
of the General
Apparel West to come.

01:29:12.734 --> 01:29:14.033
( whirring )

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.767
- ( music playing )
- Swell: Ladies and gentlemen,

01:29:17.767 --> 01:29:19.667
General Apparel West
proudly presents

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:22.033
the teenage fashion wave
of the future.

- ♪ Uh-huh ♪

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.433
♪ And when the sun
goes down ♪

01:29:27.433 --> 01:29:29.467

01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:32.800
Swell:
Tess, Marcie, and Donna

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.900
are wearing bellhop uniforms
in fuchsia, purple, and teal

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.367
hand-airbrushed slub silk
with matching caps.

01:29:38.367 --> 01:29:40.700
The epaulets
and cuff detailing

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:42.333
are antique gold lace.

01:29:42.333 --> 01:29:44.066
The jackets,
in varying lengths,

01:29:44.066 --> 01:29:45.934
are matched with either
sporty black trousers

01:29:45.934 --> 01:29:47.667
or sleek mini skirts.

01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:50.533
As you can see,
the basic General
Apparel West uniform

01:29:50.533 --> 01:29:52.700
has been modified
and accessorized

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:55.633
to create a fun and sexy look
for the teenage girl.

01:29:59.133 --> 01:30:01.800
Nicole is wearing
a formfitting nurse's uniform

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.834
with mini hem line--
sure to speed up
any boy's pulse.

01:30:07.133 --> 01:30:09.767
The black diamonds
on Nicole's cap and dress

01:30:09.767 --> 01:30:12.100
are hand-airbrushed
on fuchsia spandex.

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:14.200
Her pink
high-top sneakers

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.033
are laced up
her tangerine tights.

01:30:17.033 --> 01:30:19.066
And, of course,
no nurse would be complete

01:30:19.066 --> 01:30:21.033
without
her stethoscope necklace.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.166
( circus music playing )

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.300
Jill, a referee,

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.133
is wearing an oversized
silk jersey

01:30:33.133 --> 01:30:35.367
in bold black
and turquoise stripes,

01:30:35.367 --> 01:30:38.000
black tights,
and high-top sneakers.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.867
The whistle earrings
and necklace and black
baseball cap

01:30:40.867 --> 01:30:43.066
complement this carefree
and spirited look

01:30:43.066 --> 01:30:46.600
for the girl
who's playing the field
and calling all the plays.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.834
( circus music playing )

01:30:48.834 --> 01:30:50.734
( over P.A. )
Swell, it's me.
It's Bryan.

01:30:50.734 --> 01:30:52.700
Hey, listen, Swell,
we gotta talk about this.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.800
Forget about this other guy.
We can work this out.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.033
It was really stupid
what happened the other night

01:30:57.033 --> 01:30:58.633
I mean, I don't know
if it was some kind of

01:30:58.633 --> 01:31:00.800
communication meltdown
or what, but...

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.834
- I think
we should work it out.
- Katrina, our chef,

01:31:02.834 --> 01:31:05.867
is really cooking
in, um, her scarf

01:31:05.867 --> 01:31:08.266
and she's whipping up
excitement in her boots.

01:31:08.266 --> 01:31:10.967
Thank you, Katrina.
Thank you, Katrina.

01:31:10.967 --> 01:31:14.667
Bryan: I really care
about you, Swell--
about us.

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:16.667
There's something
about you, Swell.

01:31:16.667 --> 01:31:18.000
I don't even know
what it is, but...

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:20.867
I feel better around you
than anyone else.

01:31:20.867 --> 01:31:22.300
Swell,
I really miss you.

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.300
Swell:
And our last model
is Becky.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.800
Becky is our Boy Scout

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.400
and she is wearing
a Boy Scout's uniform.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.500
Thank you, Becky.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.300
Thank you, Becky.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.200
( applause )

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.934
Bryan?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.200
Swell:
And...

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:46.600
and, everyone,
the highlight of
our fashion extravaganza,

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:50.066
young Bryan,
our Clown Dog server.

01:31:56.734 --> 01:31:59.033
- You're having a party?
- Swell!

01:31:59.033 --> 01:32:02.934
Bryan is wearing
a Clown Dog uniform

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:05.100
with a classic
wedge cap...

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.867
- Swell.
- ...evoking
the charming nostalgia of--

01:32:08.867 --> 01:32:10.333
- Mrs. Crandell.
- What?!

01:32:10.333 --> 01:32:11.533
Mom's home.

01:32:13.567 --> 01:32:15.133
Hi, Mom.

01:32:17.867 --> 01:32:20.033
Busted. Oh!

01:32:21.834 --> 01:32:23.934
And that is our presentation
for this evening.

01:32:23.934 --> 01:32:26.166
- Thank you all for coming.
Good night.
- ( music stops )

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:28.467
Sue Ellen,
what the hell
are you doing?

01:32:28.467 --> 01:32:30.400
- What are you doing?
- I'm right on top
of that, Rose.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.066
- No. Please, you gotta
finish the presentation.
- I know what you're gonna say.

01:32:33.066 --> 01:32:35.100
- It's not as bad
as you think, Mom.
- Save it.

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.500
Oh, shit.

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.667
Come on.
Just-- just do it.

01:32:38.667 --> 01:32:40.667
Mom:
Swell!

01:32:40.667 --> 01:32:42.867
You're in big trouble,
young lady.

01:32:42.867 --> 01:32:45.233
( crowd murmuring )

01:32:45.233 --> 01:32:49.834
Um, I can't
handle this anymore.

01:32:49.834 --> 01:32:52.533
I applied for
a receptionist job.

01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:56.700
I don't even know
what an executive
administrative assistant does.

01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:01.333
I, uh--
I lied to everyone
about everything,

01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:03.800
and, um, I'm sorry.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.600
( sighs )

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.433
I'm only 17.

01:33:09.433 --> 01:33:11.533
I have a curfew.

01:33:11.533 --> 01:33:14.700
I just finished high school.
I can't even vote yet.

01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.433
This is supposed to be
my summer vacation.

01:33:16.433 --> 01:33:19.467
I'm-- I'm not
supposed to be a career mom.

01:33:19.467 --> 01:33:24.200
I, uh-- I can't be the hub
of your communication network.

01:33:25.567 --> 01:33:28.800
I'm really not ready
for any of this.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.300
I'm sorry.

01:33:32.133 --> 01:33:33.266
Rose, I'm so sorry.

01:33:35.033 --> 01:33:37.066
I'm sorry.

01:33:37.066 --> 01:33:38.667
( mic feedback squeals )

01:33:38.667 --> 01:33:41.033
How humiliating.
I love it.

01:33:41.033 --> 01:33:43.834
Yeah, babe.
Justice is served.

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:46.133
( chatter )

01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.333
( chatter continues )

01:33:51.333 --> 01:33:53.166
Bryan, what are you
doing here?

01:33:53.166 --> 01:33:54.233
Carolyn!

01:33:54.233 --> 01:33:55.967
So, do you believe me now?
( scoffs )

01:33:55.967 --> 01:33:57.867
Or are you just gonna
believe some kid?

01:33:57.867 --> 01:34:00.166
I'm gonna believe
some kid.

01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:02.000
Go to hell, Gus.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.667
Mom: Sue Ellen, I'm not
real clear about what's
been going on around here,

01:34:08.667 --> 01:34:10.867
but I want these people
off my property.

01:34:10.867 --> 01:34:14.600
And I want you
to start doing some
heavy duty explaining.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.333
I am never
trusting you again.

01:34:16.333 --> 01:34:18.400
I specifically said
no parties.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.200
You weren't supposed to
come home till next week.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.000
Sorry to have
messed up your plans.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.567
Who are these people?!

01:34:23.567 --> 01:34:26.667
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down!

01:34:26.667 --> 01:34:29.266
Walter.
What happened to Walter?

01:34:29.266 --> 01:34:32.767
He had a little accident,
but everything is
taken care of.

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.867
I have excellent
medical coverage.

01:34:34.867 --> 01:34:37.300
And we will clean up
the party, okay?

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.033
Now, come on, Mom.
You've had along flight
and you're cranky.

01:34:41.033 --> 01:34:43.233
I have had
a very rough night.

01:34:43.233 --> 01:34:45.300
So, why don't you just
go upstairs and take a nap,

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:48.667
and tomorrow morning,
Kenny will whip up a batch
of Belgian waffles

01:34:48.667 --> 01:34:50.300
and we'll sit down
and discuss this

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.033
like adults,
all right?

01:34:52.033 --> 01:34:53.667
Fine.

01:34:53.667 --> 01:34:56.333
Kenny, Zach,
why don't you guys go
wrap up the party, okay?

01:34:56.333 --> 01:34:58.100
- Okay.
- And, Melissa, why don't
you help Walter to bed?

01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.233
All right, Mommy.
I mean, Swell.

01:35:00.233 --> 01:35:02.734
Mwah. Mwah.

01:35:02.734 --> 01:35:05.433
- ( sighs ) Thank you.
- Kenny.

01:35:06.633 --> 01:35:08.300
What did you do
to yourself?

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.734
- We'll talk about it
in the morning, Mom.
- Oh, oh...

01:35:10.734 --> 01:35:14.233
But for now,
why don't you just
go to your room?

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.567
- Boy: Yeah, boy! Check it.
- Oh, that's very funny.

01:35:30.567 --> 01:35:32.633
- That is very funny.
- What?

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.033
I'll be damned.

01:35:49.166 --> 01:35:50.867
( footsteps approaching )

01:35:58.633 --> 01:35:59.834
( sighs )

01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:01.900
Rose, I am so sorry.

01:36:03.867 --> 01:36:08.700
Sue Ellen,
the buyers didn't care
anything about that scene.

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.934
They're all just
a bunch of old whores.

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.967
They loved your ideas.

01:36:13.967 --> 01:36:16.367
They see nothing
but dollar signs.

01:36:16.367 --> 01:36:18.567
As a matter of fact,
they complimented me

01:36:18.567 --> 01:36:21.633
on hiring a teenager
to gain market perspective.

01:36:21.633 --> 01:36:25.700
So I've got--
I've got seven meetings
set up next week alone.

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:28.300
They want
the new GAW line.

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.934
But what about
everything else?

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.367
I mean,
I lied to you.

01:36:35.567 --> 01:36:37.433
I'm a terrible person.

01:36:37.433 --> 01:36:41.000
Well, I suppose
you'll grow out of that.

01:36:42.333 --> 01:36:43.567
Maybe.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.533
Dude, that was
a superior party.

01:36:51.633 --> 01:36:53.700
Superior eats, man.

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.033
Yeah.

01:36:55.033 --> 01:36:56.333
Thanks for helping out.

01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:57.433
No problem.

01:36:57.433 --> 01:36:58.867
Hey, what do you say?

01:36:58.867 --> 01:37:00.166
Beer bust
tomorrow night, huh?

01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:01.266
I can't.

01:37:01.266 --> 01:37:03.967
I got a date with
Swell's friend, Nicole.

01:37:03.967 --> 01:37:05.867
- The nurse?
- Yeah.

01:37:07.033 --> 01:37:08.200
Hot!

01:37:09.467 --> 01:37:11.533
Hey, you know,
school starts next week.

01:37:11.533 --> 01:37:13.533
Lazy days.

01:37:13.533 --> 01:37:15.500
I don't know.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.767
I was thinking I might
go to class more.

01:37:17.767 --> 01:37:18.967
Why?

01:37:20.433 --> 01:37:23.266
Well, time to
finish up school.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.533
You know, I might take
some home ec.

01:37:26.533 --> 01:37:27.867
Graduate.

01:37:27.867 --> 01:37:31.734
Maybe go to
the culinary academy
or some shit like that.

01:37:31.734 --> 01:37:33.200
That could be cool.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.834
Yeah.

01:37:34.834 --> 01:37:36.500
It's time
to do something.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.867
Please reconsider.

01:37:37.867 --> 01:37:40.100
I'm offering you
a wonderful opportunity.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.900
( sighs )
I know.

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.233
And I appreciate it
a lot, really.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:48.100
But I don't know.
I think I'm gonna
try college.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.433
Design school or something.
I don't know.

01:37:50.433 --> 01:37:52.333
I still have
a lot to learn, you know?

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:55.100
Well, if you
wanna get into Vassar,
I could pull some strings.

01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.900
( chuckles )
Maybe.

01:37:59.367 --> 01:38:01.600
Gosh,
I'm gonna miss you.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.567

remember, Swell?

01:39:33.533 --> 01:39:35.834
We didn't break up.
We had a fight, Bryan.

01:39:35.834 --> 01:39:37.533
Yeah, because you were
lying to me.

01:39:37.533 --> 01:39:39.367
Yeah,
