00:45.710 --> 00:48.250
You would think
that after two years
she would know my name.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.380
At least she was close.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.330
She still calls me
by my hair color.

she'd call you "Dye-job!"

I'd do it, but I have to
go hawk my mother's silver

Jedediah Swearengen
is buried.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.500
Quick! What would
a good counselor do?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.170
Alert the authorities
about the man-eating moose
on the loose?

03:27.170 --> 03:30.330
Tell somebody
about the bodies
in the lake?

03:30.330 --> 03:32.080
I meant, to help Lou!

03:33.960 --> 03:35.750
Oh. Um...

03:35.750 --> 03:37.290
Assess the situation!

03:37.290 --> 03:39.250
Do you have insurance?
Any drug allergies?

Right now, it's type empty,

Use your belt.

04:00.420 --> 04:02.080

Who's stupid enough to be
in a graveyard at night?"

04:24.170 --> 04:26.210
You know,
legend says

04:26.210 --> 04:29.080
if you call
the camp founder's name
three times,

04:29.080 --> 04:32.290
his spirit
will be released
from the grave.

04:32.290 --> 04:34.290
Ooh, fun!

04:34.290 --> 04:37.620
What's fun about
saying "Jedediah"
three times?

04:39.170 --> 04:41.880
I'm sorry, what name?

04:41.880 --> 04:43.330
Jedediah.

have to speak up.

I can't believe
you guys tricked me.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.500
Now, that dead guy
is gonna kill us.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.670
Or, maybe he'll just
gently haunt us.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.250
That's it?

05:05.250 --> 05:08.290
Our lunch yesterday
was scarier than that.

05:10.290 --> 05:13.170
Hey, guys,
look at this grave!

05:15.380 --> 05:18.120
(GASPS)
Something disturbed
the dirt.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.710
This isn't
just any grave...

05:19.710 --> 05:22.380
it's Jedediah
Swearengen's!

05:22.380 --> 05:24.710
I think we just
released his ghost.

05:24.710 --> 05:26.880
I just released
something too...

05:26.880 --> 05:28.580
and it wasn't a ghost.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.420
CITs, pick up the pace.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.500
Do you think they're
taking us into the woods
for our initiation,

05:37.500 --> 05:39.210
where we'll get our
counselor badges?

05:39.210 --> 05:43.080
Yes. Oh, perhaps there
will be a ceremony
and a secret handshake.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.620
And... we're here.

05:47.290 --> 05:49.290
Oh, where is everybody?

05:49.290 --> 05:51.080
This looks like Ravi's
last birthday party.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.920
Speaking of which, Emma,
why could you not come?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.620
Oh, sorry.
I didn't get the address.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.710
Your room is across
the hall from me.

06:03.290 --> 06:06.170
We're here so you can
take your final test
to become counselors.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.250
You need to spend
a night in the woods
by yourselves.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.420
What?
Spend the night?

06:10.420 --> 06:12.620
But I did not bring
my hypoallergenic
neck pillow,

06:12.620 --> 06:15.420
or my compression
stockings.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.250
You got your work
cut out for you
with this one.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.290
Oh, forget him.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.330
Unless this dirt has
an 800 thread count,

06:21.330 --> 06:23.880
I'm going back
to the campout.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.120
To pass this test,
you need to use the skills
you've learned as CITs

06:27.120 --> 06:30.040
to build a shelter,
start a fire
and find food.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.460
And to help you out,
we're giving you
this canteen of water.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.500
Oh, gee, thanks.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.040
(SOFTLY) There's
a candy bar taped
to the bottom of it.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.080

Good luck, you guys.
We'll see you
tomorrow morning.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.500
Not without my make-up
you won't.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.330
She has a point.
You do not wanna
see that.

(ALL PANTING)

06:56.210 --> 06:57.670
That was close!

06:57.670 --> 06:59.620
I was afraid
Jedediah's ghost

06:59.620 --> 07:03.000
was gonna suck
our brains out
through our eyeholes!

07:03.000 --> 07:05.040
Those of us
who have brains.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.330

07:11.040 --> 07:13.210
Guys, we should
not have left.

07:13.210 --> 07:16.620
It's our fault
that Jedediah's spirit
is wandering around.

07:16.620 --> 07:19.120
Who cares?
Let him wander.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.380
He's 134 years old.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.040
He can take care
of himself.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.250
(SIGHS)

07:24.250 --> 07:26.250
No, Zuri, we have to
go back and fix this.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.210
We need to find
Jedediah's ghost

07:28.210 --> 07:29.750
and return him
to his resting place.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.000
How are we going
to find a ghost?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.920
Not being seen
is what they're
best at!

07:34.920 --> 07:36.420
I have an idea.

07:36.420 --> 07:39.000
But if it doesn't work,
and the enraged ghost
wreaks havoc,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.290
I say we blame Ravi.

07:40.290 --> 07:41.380
Works for me.
Me too.

07:41.380 --> 07:44.120
I blame Ravi
for everything...

07:44.120 --> 07:47.460
although it works
better at camp
than it does at home.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.330
There, all done.

07:51.330 --> 07:53.380
Lou would be
so impressed.

07:53.380 --> 07:55.330
Of course,
she grew up in a barn

07:55.330 --> 07:58.170
so the bar is kind of low.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.500
Nice work, Emma.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.380
Two summers ago,
you could not even
make your own bed.

08:02.380 --> 08:06.290
I know. I thought
that's why God
invented Bertram.

08:06.290 --> 08:10.000
Now, let us find some
actual food so we can
ace this survival test.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.040
I just wish all the
leaves in the woods
didn't taste like...

08:13.040 --> 08:15.290
leaves in the woods.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.540
Oh, well, there is a fluid
secreted by a gland
in a beaver's buttocks

08:18.540 --> 08:20.790
that we can use to make
an artificial sweetener.

08:20.790 --> 08:23.120
So, uh, fingers crossed
we find a beaver to squeeze.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.170
Good luck passing
your test now.

08:33.170 --> 08:34.170
Ha-ha!

08:39.790 --> 08:42.290
Hey, what the
heck happened?

08:42.290 --> 08:45.170
I think your lean-to
leaned too much.

08:45.170 --> 08:47.170
(LAUGHS)

08:47.170 --> 08:48.460
Too soon?

08:51.290 --> 08:53.250
Cool hut, Ravi.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.790
Actually,
it is a yurt.

08:54.790 --> 08:57.330
The geodesic design
is not only pleasing
to the eye,

08:57.330 --> 08:59.500
but it is engineered
to distribute weight

08:59.500 --> 09:02.250
for maximum
structural integrity.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.080
You could've
just said, "Thanks."

09:05.170 --> 09:07.040
Sorry, I am not used

09:07.040 --> 09:08.830
to getting compliments
from girls.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.250
Say goodbye
to your nerd cave!

09:16.250 --> 09:17.960
Ha... Huh?

09:19.250 --> 09:21.710
(GRUNTS) I better
kick this up a notch,

09:21.710 --> 09:23.120
literally.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.830
What? No!

09:31.830 --> 09:34.880
So much for your
"geodesic design."

09:34.880 --> 09:37.460
Your yurt got hurt
and hit the dirt.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.790
(LAUGHING)

09:39.290 --> 09:40.380
Emma!

09:40.380 --> 09:42.080
Oh, but when you
do it, it's okay?

09:46.830 --> 09:48.420
Okay, Griff,
once we lure

09:48.420 --> 09:50.120
the ghost
of Jedediah
back here,

09:50.120 --> 09:52.540
your job is to toss
the baking powder
on him,

09:52.540 --> 09:54.620
thus making him visible
to the naked eye.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.500
(CHUCKLES)
You said "naked."

09:57.500 --> 09:59.330
Jorge, you're going
to be the bait.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.710
Why me?

10:00.710 --> 10:02.580
Because you're the one
who called him.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.460
Because you guys
tricked me!

10:04.460 --> 10:07.380
Which was
surprisingly easy.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.710
I've met bread
smarter than you.
(CHUCKLES)

10:10.710 --> 10:14.460
Okay, Zuri, your job is to
suck the ghost into the
vacuum once we see him.

10:14.460 --> 10:18.210
And if there's time,
I'll also suck up
whatever's left of Jorge.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.380
(VACUUM CLEANER WHIRS)
Great!

10:20.380 --> 10:22.040
Now, get out there,
and look hauntable.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.210
Fine!

10:23.210 --> 10:26.120
But if anything happens
to me and I become a ghost,

10:26.120 --> 10:29.170
I'm coming back to
make your lives miserable.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.210
You already do that.

10:34.250 --> 10:37.120
Sorry I woke you up, Jedediah.

is wrong with you kids?

I'm not a ghost.

Although, you wouldn't
know it from the way men
look right through me.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.250
Sorry, Gladys, but we
accidentally released
Jedediah's spirit

11:22.250 --> 11:24.460
and now he's gonna
haunt Camp Kikiwaka forever.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.790
Oh, you kids
and your imagination.

11:26.790 --> 11:29.000
There's no such thing
as ghosts!

11:29.750 --> 11:31.250
But we have proof.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.880
Look, his grave
has been disturbed!

11:32.880 --> 11:34.710
MS. GLADYS: Oh, I did that.

11:34.710 --> 11:38.120
It's my tradition to visit
his final resting place
on the last night of camp.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.420
To pay your respects?

11:39.420 --> 11:41.080
No, to spit on his grave.

11:43.120 --> 11:47.290
Thanks to him, I'm stuck here
running this stupid camp.

11:48.210 --> 11:49.420
But why did you
dig it up?

11:49.420 --> 11:51.330
Oh, I was gonna
plant these flowers.

but I'm not a monster.

would you rather be doing?

is that I got my

all muddy.

Xander?

there might be

13:10.920 --> 13:12.380
I was watching
over you because

13:12.380 --> 13:15.210
I wasn't sure that you guys
could make it on your own.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.250
What?

did not believe in me either,

but every one of those
football players
got their towels.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.040
Xander, the whole
point of this test is
for Emma and Ravi

13:28.040 --> 13:30.290
to prove that they can
do this on their own.

13:30.290 --> 13:32.170

you're gonna do

is roasting the

There's a melted
candle holder
under Xander's bed.

It's probably just that
scented candle I gave Xander
for our anniversary.

Nope, that candle's
in my mom's
guest bathroom.

17:17.290 --> 17:20.620
Because I loved it so much.

17:20.620 --> 17:25.080
Judging by the scorch marks
on this box spring
and the path the fire took,

17:25.080 --> 17:28.250
it looks like this candle
must have fallen over
and started the fire.

17:29.460 --> 17:32.210
Wow, Ravi.
How did you
figure that out?

17:32.210 --> 17:35.210

"Essence of Xander."

Yeah, in crazy land.

used Xander's ear wax
to make candles.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.210
We do? Huh.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.710
That explains my
recurring dream about
creepy aliens probing my ears.

missing the point.
This is serious.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.580
Okay, fine!

18:10.580 --> 18:12.790
I must have forgotten
to put out the candle
after I lit it

18:12.790 --> 18:15.750
for my romantic date
with Xander's pillow.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.210
You go on dates
with my pillow?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.250
No.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.250
Unless you find that
kind of thing endearing.

get married and have a baby,

in Grizzly cabin.

banished now.

I'm not going
to banish Hazel.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.750
Aw! Because I'm your
niece and you love me?

18:59.380 --> 19:01.080
No.

19:01.080 --> 19:05.920
Because I owe your dad
20 grand for my
spider vein removal.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.830
Well, at least
Xandy and I will
never be torn apart.

19:09.830 --> 19:11.250
We were never together.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.790
Eh, we're leaving
in a few hours.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.330
Just give her this one.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.750
But we cannot leave
in a few hours.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.830
Emma and I need more
time to take our
overnight counselor exam.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.960
Actually, you don't
need a test.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.580
This fire was a
real-life crisis,

19:24.580 --> 19:27.620
and you both stepped up
and got the job done.

19:27.620 --> 19:30.670
And that's what
real counselors do.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.170
Ravi, did Gladys just
compliment us?

19:34.170 --> 19:37.380
Yes.
I am a little scared.

19:37.380 --> 19:41.830
Rudy and Blondie,
you are officially promoted
to Camp Kikiwaka counselors.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.380
(BOTH GASP)

19:43.380 --> 19:45.960
I can't believe
I have to be
counselors with them.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.120
You don't.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.290
You burned down two cabins.

19:49.290 --> 19:51.170
I'm demoting you to CIT.

19:51.170 --> 19:54.670

they're going to be
bossing me around?

19:56.880 --> 19:58.210
No!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.170

20:02.170 --> 20:04.290
Yes, we are counselors!

20:05.460 --> 20:06.880
Ow, Ravi.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.330
Your chin whisker
just scratched me.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.540
It did?

20:09.540 --> 20:11.080
No. (LAUGHING)

20:14.960 --> 20:16.420
Welcome to
the club, guys.

20:16.420 --> 20:17.830
I knew you could do it.

20:17.830 --> 20:19.290
And I should've known.

20:19.290 --> 20:20.380
Oh, thanks, guys.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.920
We couldn't have
done it without you.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.420
Yes, you taught us
everything we know.

20:25.420 --> 20:28.750
Well, you're great students,
and I'm really happy for you.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.000
Me, too.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I'm also happy I'm not
dating a CIT anymore.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.120
People were starting to talk.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.500
Yippee, you're all leaving!

20:41.500 --> 20:43.210
Load your stuff
in the van.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.830
Aren't you forgetting?
We don't have any stuff.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.290
Then you can get
in the van even faster.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.750
Well, we might have lost
most of our belongings,

20:51.750 --> 20:54.380
but at least we still
have our memories.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.540
What could be more
valuable than that?

20:56.540 --> 21:00.500
The $75,000
I had stashed
in my mattress.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.460
Emma, I...

21:05.460 --> 21:07.330
(VOICE BREAKING)
I just...

21:07.330 --> 21:08.920
The thought of saying
goodbye to you...

21:10.120 --> 21:12.120
(CRYING) Hold it
together, Xander.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.290
Aw, Xander,
that is really sweet.

21:16.290 --> 21:19.290
But you know we still
have a two-hour van ride
together, right?

21:19.290 --> 21:20.330
Only two?

21:22.170 --> 21:26.250
I still can't believe
our cabins turned
into a giant bonfire.

21:26.250 --> 21:31.250
On the bright side, the fire
destroyed all of Xander's
Justin Bieber figurines.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.830
That was supposed
to be our little secret.

21:33.830 --> 21:36.920
To keep a secret
like that will cost you
way more than five bucks.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.290
Wow, I'm really gonna
miss all you guys.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.790
It was another great
summer at camp.

21:45.790 --> 21:48.380
Well, except for
the whole fire thing.

21:48.380 --> 21:52.330
Yeah. I really hope
we get to do it all
again next year.

21:52.330 --> 21:54.290
Except for the
whole fire thing.
(CHUCKLES)

21:54.290 --> 21:58.540
I just don't know what
Camp Kikiwaka is gonna be
like without our cabins.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.420
It is going
to be wonderful.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.750
It is not the cabins
that make this place
so special.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.000
It is the people.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.920
Cut the sappy stuff
and get in the van!

22:10.120 --> 22:13.040
Well, not all the people.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.790
Do you think Hazel's
still upset that she was
demoted to CIT?

22:16.330 --> 22:18.790
(HORN HONKING)

22:18.790 --> 22:20.210
(ALL LAUGHING)

22:20.210 --> 22:21.250
Little bit.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.330
Hey, Emma,
tell your dad I say hello.

22:26.330 --> 22:29.120
Oh, sorry, we're not allowed
to mention you in the house.

22:32.380 --> 22:33.620
♪ Here we go

22:33.620 --> 22:36.670
♪ Leaving the city
behind right now

22:36.670 --> 22:39.170

22:42.670 --> 22:44.250

22:44.250 --> 22:46.920

22:48.210 --> 22:50.670

22:50.670 --> 22:53.460
