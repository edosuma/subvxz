01:38.833 --> 01:40.832
Your Holiness, do you need anything?

02:39.458 --> 02:41.832
My fellow Members of Parliament,
we will not be intimidated

02:42.000 --> 02:44.290
by any last minute defectors,

02:44.541 --> 02:49.290
who might think this ship is sinking.

02:49.541 --> 02:52.749
Go right ahead,
but the government is strong

02:52.958 --> 02:57.082
and I assure you
this ship will not sink.

02:57.291 --> 02:59.165
It will not sink!

03:00.208 --> 03:01.999
He told them this time.

03:02.958 --> 03:04.832
He just doesn't get it.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.540
I'd say you don't.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.749
Excuse me.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.540
Please, excuse me!

03:22.708 --> 03:24.290
Great job!

03:27.708 --> 03:30.832
Thanks to you all!
See you on Monday, don't forget.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.082
Well done, great speech!

03:33.291 --> 03:35.165
Cut the compliments, Malgradi,

03:35.416 --> 03:38.290
and make our friends
at the Treasury reason.

03:38.541 --> 03:41.207
Since you're on the committee,
talk to them yourself,

03:41.500 --> 03:43.665
you cannot simply sit there
and second.

03:43.875 --> 03:47.040
I'm bending over backwards
on that committee, but by now...

03:47.250 --> 03:50.915
If we'd dumped them, the government
wouldn't be about to fall.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.165
Enough talk,

03:53.458 --> 03:55.249
take action!

04:05.041 --> 04:07.790
How's it going with the amendment
on the waterfront of Ostia

04:08.000 --> 04:10.499
to put into the Suburban Renewal Law?

04:10.708 --> 04:13.832
About halfway,
seeing who's behind it...

04:14.000 --> 04:16.082
They're the good ones,
here they are!

04:16.291 --> 04:18.707
Keep up the good work, well done!

04:18.916 --> 04:22.207
- What happened?
- We'll leave the Party.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.415
Who'd ever thought it of you,
so straight and upright!

04:25.666 --> 04:29.832
- You're one to preach!
- Well done, well done!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.290
- Have you read it?
- What?

04:32.541 --> 04:34.957
The various European statements
on us.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.124
Fuck!

05:07.708 --> 05:09.582
Ah, you speak Italian!

05:36.875 --> 05:38.540
Ninni!

05:39.333 --> 05:41.874
Going great, isn't it?

05:42.208 --> 05:45.999
Take a break, that knock-out body
might rack-up victims.

05:47.041 --> 05:50.624
By the way, someone's asking
for you, what do I do?

05:50.833 --> 05:54.999
It could be good, he's organizing a
conference next year here in Rome,

05:55.166 --> 05:57.707
I could do it myself,
if you put in a good word.

05:57.916 --> 06:00.165
I'm already busy tonight.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.332
- With him, like always?
- Yes.

06:05.041 --> 06:08.624
I gotta find him a different girl
every night. He's obsessed.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.082
Thanks to you all, good night.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.249
- Sir, good evening!
- Good evening.

06:48.500 --> 06:53.290
Ms. Lagarde
said Italy lacks credibility

06:53.541 --> 06:56.624
in the announced measures,
isn't that a rejection?

06:56.833 --> 07:00.124
No one's rejecting anyone,
let's be serious.

07:00.375 --> 07:05.040
The opposition says
Italy is on the brink of default.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.207
I think it's wrong to think Italy
is in a severe financial crisis,

07:09.458 --> 07:11.957
consumer spending
hasn't decreased at all

07:12.125 --> 07:15.249
and our lifestyle is
that of an affluent country.

07:15.916 --> 07:18.374
We're not on the brink of any abyss.

07:18.791 --> 07:21.499
- Thank you.
- Keep up the good work.

08:32.666 --> 08:34.664
Goodnight, Your Holiness.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.624
Darling,

08:54.833 --> 08:58.124
the committee will go on late,
don't wait up.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.915
Yes, I'm a little tired,

09:02.291 --> 09:05.207
but don't worry,
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:06.916 --> 09:08.332
Bye.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.790
You can drop me here.

09:24.125 --> 09:27.499
- Good evening, Mr. Malgradi.
- Hi Faisal, any news on your son?

09:27.708 --> 09:29.790
- Not yet.
- I'm sorry.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.082
For your trouble...

09:34.083 --> 09:35.165
Thank you.

09:37.666 --> 09:39.249
Have a good night.

10:42.791 --> 10:45.999
Shut up,
you're upsetting my girlfriend.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.832
Listen...

10:49.583 --> 10:51.874
How about this signature?

10:54.458 --> 10:56.040
We gotta go, Aureliano!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.957
You're wasting my time
just for a signature!

11:01.708 --> 11:03.540
Give me that, Mirco.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.374
What are you doing?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.624
- How about this signature?
- Yes!

11:10.833 --> 11:14.457
- Don't cry! Yes or no?
- Yes, I'll sign!

11:14.666 --> 11:16.540
I'll sign, I'll sign!

11:16.750 --> 11:18.124
Good man.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.082
See? That didn't take much.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.915
Don't do it. No!

11:27.291 --> 11:28.582
C'mon!

11:28.833 --> 11:30.249
C'mon, c'mon!

11:30.500 --> 11:31.957
Let's go!

12:02.625 --> 12:04.707
Why all these people?

12:04.916 --> 12:08.207
The first nightclub rounds are done,
now they're going again.

12:08.458 --> 12:11.582
- Move, think we're on vacation?
- C'mon, let's move!

12:22.250 --> 12:25.832
- Evenin', Scab.
- I said don't call me that.

12:27.208 --> 12:30.457
So? What are we doing here?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.957
Tell Samurai even the guy at Traiano
says he'll sell.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.957
My work's almost done,
you gotta have me meet him.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.207
- You can tell me.
- You?

12:46.666 --> 12:48.749
Who the fuck are you?

12:49.583 --> 12:53.374
If my dad hadn't got you votes,
you'd still be robbin' old ladies.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.124
Your father reasoned with people.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.249
- I'm not my father.
- I know.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.582
In fact, you've got
more balls than brains.

13:21.208 --> 13:24.582
Tell Samurai
I got more contracts in two months

13:24.791 --> 13:26.665
than Dad in two years.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.624
Okay?

13:33.958 --> 13:35.624
Bye, Scab!

14:04.125 --> 14:05.624
Roach?

14:05.833 --> 14:07.249
He's inside.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.582
This town's all changed,

14:52.416 --> 14:55.332
the traffic, the buildings...

14:57.916 --> 14:59.582
Even this place, what is it?

14:59.833 --> 15:02.082
What was here before?

15:02.541 --> 15:04.415
Nothing.

15:04.625 --> 15:07.332
And you? Have you changed too?

15:09.291 --> 15:11.165
Or are you
the same Samurai you were?

15:11.875 --> 15:14.124
The warrior
at the service of the Idea?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.999
I carry the Idea right here now,

15:20.166 --> 15:21.874
and that's it.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.415
Twenty years...

15:27.250 --> 15:30.374
I did 20 years
for heists and neo-fascist terrorism,

15:32.125 --> 15:34.207
but now Pippo's a big shot,

15:36.083 --> 15:38.582
you've become the king of Rome...

15:38.833 --> 15:40.249
And me?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.124
Nothing.

15:50.541 --> 15:51.999
What would you like?

15:57.208 --> 15:59.749
A little piece
of your trafficking with Africa.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.915
I'll handle the diamonds
from down there for you.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.415
And if I say no?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.207
- You can't.
- Why not?

16:11.416 --> 16:13.374
Because this time I won't keep quiet.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.040
What's your hand?

16:17.250 --> 16:19.790
Don't worry, my cards are good.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.165
Nothing's in your house, we cleaned
it out when they arrested you.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.082
That's what lawyers are for.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.582
You're bluffing.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.165
And you're not good at it.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.082
If I'm bluffing, show your hand.

16:51.625 --> 16:54.124
Your lawyer is on my payroll,

16:55.000 --> 16:56.624
been on it for years.

21:19.458 --> 21:20.915
Ilena!

21:28.416 --> 21:30.249
What's the matter?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.124
Fuck, she's really sick.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.499
- And she's a minor.
- It's what you asked me for.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.415
I know! Help me, shit.

23:14.041 --> 23:16.124
What do you want me to do?

23:17.833 --> 23:20.207
You're the big shot, call someone!

23:22.166 --> 23:24.457
I can't call anyone.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.415
That colonel friend of yours?

23:31.125 --> 23:33.207
And what do I tell him?

23:34.833 --> 23:37.082
Let's take her out,
have you got the car?

23:39.875 --> 23:42.249
- No, I sent the driver away.
- Call him back.

23:42.458 --> 23:44.082
Shut up!

23:50.541 --> 23:53.457
Don't talk shit, shut up!

24:04.458 --> 24:07.915
I have to go, I can't stay here,
you can understand that.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.540
You can't leave.

24:09.791 --> 24:13.165
Cover her, will you please?
Cover her? Shit!

24:35.000 --> 24:36.415
So?

24:44.500 --> 24:46.749
I'll call a friend of mine.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.999
Good, do that.

25:07.041 --> 25:09.332
I'm off on the usual rounds.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.207
Send the kids to bed,

25:11.416 --> 25:13.999
it's like Christmas here.

25:30.916 --> 25:33.374
Okay, get to bed!

25:58.875 --> 26:00.290
Eminence...

26:01.000 --> 26:03.665
What's the matter? Does he feel ill?

26:04.708 --> 26:07.207
No, it's not that,

26:07.791 --> 26:09.999
it's... more,

26:10.208 --> 26:12.915
it's something
I should probably keep to myself,

26:13.125 --> 26:16.249
because the Holy Father
confided in me like a son,

26:17.041 --> 26:19.207
but the burden is too heavy.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.582
What did he tell you?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.707
The Pope wants to step down.

26:33.166 --> 26:35.040
That can't be!

26:44.333 --> 26:46.624
Did he say
when he intends to do this?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.874
Very soon.

27:40.708 --> 27:44.665
Aren't you ever sick of this place?
Why don't you sell it?

27:44.875 --> 27:46.207
No way!

27:47.541 --> 27:49.624
You know what's about to happen here?

27:50.875 --> 27:52.832
Ostia will be like Las Vegas.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.624
You'll see how much it'll be worth!

28:10.458 --> 28:12.540
Why do you like it so much?

28:14.208 --> 28:16.290
Because it's all mine.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.082
Don't you like it?

28:21.291 --> 28:22.749
You don't?

28:23.166 --> 28:25.040
And what do you like?

28:26.291 --> 28:27.749
You.

28:38.791 --> 28:41.499
And this? Do you like this?

28:41.708 --> 28:43.165
Yeah, that too.

28:43.375 --> 28:46.082
That too?
Don't you love it most of all?

28:46.291 --> 28:48.374
No, not most of all.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.832
What's better?

29:01.083 --> 29:03.374
Watching you sleep.

29:21.375 --> 29:23.457
Okay, so...

29:26.833 --> 29:28.457
I'm leaving.

29:36.666 --> 29:39.165
Don't contact me, I'll call you.

31:11.541 --> 31:14.874
- Need any help?
- No, Faisal, she drank too much.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.790
- Should I call a taxi?
- I'm the taxi, bye!

33:26.333 --> 33:27.999
You look tired.

33:29.416 --> 33:33.040
Yeah, Dad, I'm exhausted,
I just got off work.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.040
What did you want?

33:45.458 --> 33:48.582
Nothing in particular.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.457
You called me three times tonight.

33:54.791 --> 33:58.332
That's because yesterday
I went to the cemetery.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.915
Couldn't you go too, once in a while?

34:02.750 --> 34:05.665
Your mother's grave
was full of dead flowers.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.415
If she were alive, she'd like that.

34:09.625 --> 34:12.123
I'd like her to be alive too.

34:21.083 --> 34:24.206
Listen, I'm dead tired,
I need to get to bed.

34:26.291 --> 34:30.040
Why don't I come by
the construction site tomorrow?

34:31.125 --> 34:34.873
Actually, tomorrow's a mess,
but the day after...

34:35.875 --> 34:37.331
Friday?

34:39.416 --> 34:42.123
It was a mistake
having you come here.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.915
Dad...

34:47.750 --> 34:50.665
- Need a lift?
- Bye, Seba.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.457
I'll pay!

35:00.666 --> 35:01.707
How much?

35:06.791 --> 35:08.249
Thank you.

36:00.041 --> 36:01.499
Stop!

36:02.750 --> 36:04.915
He jumped!

36:05.125 --> 36:07.207
Call someone!

36:09.208 --> 36:12.124
Call an ambulance, hurry!

37:08.000 --> 37:11.665
Mr. Malgradi won't be here
for an hour, if you like...

37:11.875 --> 37:13.707
All right, I'll wait.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.165
Got any coffee around here?

37:24.416 --> 37:27.124
Add a drop of cold milk
and make me happy!

38:05.416 --> 38:07.707
Someone wants to talk to you.

38:08.666 --> 38:11.582
We heard of your loss, condolences.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.290
Thank you.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.582
You must come with us now.

38:17.625 --> 38:19.915
- Where?
- To Manfredi.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.999
So he can explain everything.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.624
What?

38:23.833 --> 38:26.332
Why your father decided to fuck off.

38:27.208 --> 38:31.374
How dare you speak to me like that?
Do I know you?

38:31.583 --> 38:33.124
Calm down.

38:33.333 --> 38:36.249
- Don't you know who Manfredi is?
- No, no idea.

38:36.458 --> 38:39.665
Your father knew him well,
they were in business.

38:39.875 --> 38:42.582
He's my uncle,
we have the same last name,

38:42.791 --> 38:44.249
Anacleti.

38:46.166 --> 38:49.915
Excuse me, let's talk about this
some other time, tomorrow...

38:50.125 --> 38:52.624
No, not tomorrow, today,

38:52.833 --> 38:54.707
believe me, it's better.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.874
That person wants to talk to you,

39:07.083 --> 39:09.582
I wasn't able to send him away.

39:10.875 --> 39:13.582
How are you, Mr. Malgradi?
Everything okay?

39:14.458 --> 39:16.207
Excuse me, who are you?

39:16.416 --> 39:18.999
We saw each other last night.

39:20.375 --> 39:22.665
Wanna talk about it
in front of everyone?

39:25.708 --> 39:27.124
No.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.540
Come with me.

39:50.375 --> 39:54.124
From now on, you and your playmates
get your coke from me

39:54.333 --> 39:56.290
and your hookers too,

39:56.500 --> 39:58.582
you gotta get them from me too.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.624
And,
seein' you got dealings all over,

40:04.250 --> 40:06.124
let me cash-in on something.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.249
What dealings? Cash-in... what?

40:10.166 --> 40:12.874
I'm not a businessman,
I'm a politician.

40:13.083 --> 40:15.582
Exactly, what the fuck
do you think I'm saying?

40:16.458 --> 40:20.499
Politicians eat
and you gotta let me eat too

40:20.708 --> 40:25.082
or I'll go to the cops
and tell them everything.

40:25.291 --> 40:26.999
I understand.

40:27.916 --> 40:31.332
How much? I'll find a way
to get it to you.

40:31.541 --> 40:35.915
You don't see, I want you
to get me in with the right people,

40:36.125 --> 40:37.999
you decide.

40:41.166 --> 40:44.499
Relax, I'll give you time.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.374
I know you're worried,

40:47.583 --> 40:50.290
killing a minor with overdose
doesn't happen every day.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.582
I didn't kill anyone.

40:57.166 --> 40:59.249
You have one day,

40:59.666 --> 41:01.290
I'll be back tomorrow.

41:58.458 --> 41:59.874
Hello.

42:05.791 --> 42:08.290
Do you know why
your father killed himself?

42:09.833 --> 42:11.665
No, I don't.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.290
Debts.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.915
A mountain of debts,

42:17.166 --> 42:18.499
with us.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.915
Things weren't going well
for him lately.

42:25.416 --> 42:28.540
I know he had a tough period
two years ago.

42:28.750 --> 42:31.332
That continued

42:31.541 --> 42:34.999
and we took on all his debts,

42:35.166 --> 42:37.457
we're talking millions.

42:40.625 --> 42:44.040
So, everything he had is ours.

42:45.375 --> 42:49.124
He passed on early
and we want our investment back.

42:52.708 --> 42:56.249
My friend, when the fat runs out,

42:56.458 --> 43:01.124
you get what you can, even the
nerves, right down to the bone.

43:01.708 --> 43:03.999
Get my drift?

43:04.916 --> 43:08.249
Too bad nothing's in my name,
or I could have...

43:08.458 --> 43:10.999
We're off to a bad start.

43:11.208 --> 43:13.915
How about the villa
where you organize parties?

43:15.208 --> 43:18.999
No, it's in the company name,
all I have is stock.

43:19.166 --> 43:21.665
The majority of share,
so, it's yours.

43:21.875 --> 43:23.540
Not exactly...

43:26.416 --> 43:29.540
I'll give you a week
to hand over the villa,

43:29.750 --> 43:33.915
the house, car and all
the small change you can scrape up.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.790
I'm furious with your father,

43:38.916 --> 43:42.749
so, if you don't go, I'll chop
your leg off, put it in the fridge

43:43.000 --> 43:45.665
and give it back
when you bring me the money.

44:08.708 --> 44:10.374
Scabbre...

44:14.125 --> 44:17.040
I need a hand, you have to help me.

44:19.125 --> 44:22.040
- You asking me?
- Yes, only you.

44:24.750 --> 44:27.249
I had a visit from a guy,

44:29.750 --> 44:33.165
who needs to be taught
certain things can't be done.

45:16.833 --> 45:18.290
Who is it?

45:19.625 --> 45:21.499
A scab.

45:25.583 --> 45:27.040
I'm listening.

45:59.125 --> 46:00.790
Hi, Dagger.

46:02.916 --> 46:05.832
Hi, you scared me.

46:06.041 --> 46:09.165
The devil himself can't scare you!

46:10.458 --> 46:12.332
Wait a minute.

46:14.333 --> 46:16.082
The politician complained.

46:17.250 --> 46:20.374
The fuck you're doing going
to his office in front of everyone?

46:22.208 --> 46:25.207
- It's none of your fucking business.
- It's not done.

46:26.416 --> 46:28.790
We treat those people different.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.332
What do you want?

46:30.541 --> 46:34.082
Are you his butler?
Why didn't he come directly to me?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.707
Same reason your brother didn't go

46:39.750 --> 46:41.832
and sent you.

46:42.583 --> 46:45.040
Manfredi doesn't even know I saw him,

46:45.250 --> 46:46.999
this is my own deal.

46:47.208 --> 46:49.707
Politics aren't your thing,
forget it.

46:49.916 --> 46:51.457
And who's thing is it, yours?

46:52.416 --> 46:56.165
Sorry but you gotta make room for me,
I'm sittin' at this table too.

47:02.416 --> 47:05.124
Why do you touch your dick
when you talk? Got the clap?

47:05.333 --> 47:07.832
- Maybe you do.
- Don't fuck me around.

47:09.041 --> 47:11.124
Who knows, maybe so.

47:15.250 --> 47:19.915
Manfredi's right, when he says the
Atlantic separates you and your pa.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.665
Your brother doesn't even know
where the Atlantic is, Dagger.

47:23.875 --> 47:27.415
So, I'll tell him you'll be by
to give him a geography test.

47:27.625 --> 47:30.749
- Good!
- Now get the fuck lost!

48:22.083 --> 48:24.290
Manfredi!

48:24.916 --> 48:26.540
Manfredi!

48:47.541 --> 48:50.874
He died next
to the locked door of his car,

48:51.125 --> 48:53.249
a brand new luxury SUV.

48:53.458 --> 48:56.832
Maybe he wanted to run
and was attacked from behind.

48:57.041 --> 48:58.707
Alberto Anacleti is local,

48:58.916 --> 49:00.790
young, he grew up here.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.707
A figure known to police

49:03.916 --> 49:06.624
by his nickname, Dagger.

49:06.833 --> 49:09.999
We're on the south east
side of Rome,

49:10.208 --> 49:13.499
home to many strip clubs.

49:13.708 --> 49:18.915
Forensics is at work
where it happened last night.

49:19.125 --> 49:22.874
The victim is a young man, about 25,

49:23.083 --> 49:27.749
it appears he was stabbed

49:28.000 --> 49:31.332
and for the moment,
the men are working,

49:31.541 --> 49:33.874
but the weapon
still hasn't been found.

49:52.916 --> 49:54.790
Hi, Pippo.

50:04.625 --> 50:07.999
ACCIDENT OR EXECUTION?

50:10.250 --> 50:12.082
Did you read about Roach?

50:18.291 --> 50:19.707
Did you do it?

50:21.291 --> 50:23.124
It was Rome,

50:23.875 --> 50:27.707
it's dangerous even to cross
the street in this fucking city.

50:31.750 --> 50:35.290
Over time I've learned
to take it easy with the dead,

50:37.166 --> 50:39.457
they're tough to handle.

50:42.083 --> 50:44.582
But it seems you don't know that.

50:48.125 --> 50:49.832
What are you talking about?

50:50.083 --> 50:52.665
What the fuck were you thinking
calling Aureliano Adami

50:52.875 --> 50:55.457
to resolve a matter
involving the Anacleti family?

50:55.666 --> 50:59.499
Manfredi Anacleti is one
of the most badass fucks in Rome.

50:59.750 --> 51:03.499
I didn't call anyone,
I don't know this Aureliano Adami.

51:03.708 --> 51:07.457
- He's called "Number 8".
- I said I don't know him!

51:09.541 --> 51:12.457
I just wanted to scare the idiot

51:12.666 --> 51:14.332
who was blackmailing me,

51:14.541 --> 51:16.832
I spoke to a party colleague
who has contacts...

51:17.041 --> 51:19.124
Why didn't you call me?

51:24.125 --> 51:26.124
I haven't seen
or heard from you in years.

51:29.583 --> 51:33.124
How the fuck did I know
the asshole would kill him?

51:37.458 --> 51:39.749
How did you find out?

51:40.458 --> 51:42.749
I know lots of things.

51:47.250 --> 51:49.749
So, why are you here?

51:50.000 --> 51:51.832
To give you a hand,

51:52.625 --> 51:55.540
if anyone rubs you wrong,
I'll cover you.

52:01.583 --> 52:04.082
In exchange
I need the Suburban Renewal Law.

52:04.916 --> 52:06.374
It's on its way.

52:06.583 --> 52:09.290
With the amendment
for the Ostia beaches?

52:09.500 --> 52:12.624
- No, that still...
- Vote it with the amendment.

52:12.833 --> 52:15.332
- You're on the committee, right?
- Yes, but I can't...

52:15.583 --> 52:17.457
Once again, vote it.

52:17.666 --> 52:20.790
In a few days, your party,
the government... will fall apart.

52:21.791 --> 52:26.040
Rumors, gossip, anyway
I'll ask my party leaders...

52:26.250 --> 52:28.999
Your leaders no longer exist.

52:36.833 --> 52:40.374
If the law passes before the
government falls, meaning days,

52:43.375 --> 52:47.540
Santa Claus will bring your
foundation a couple of million.

52:55.583 --> 52:58.707
Just push the law in the Chamber,

52:59.291 --> 53:01.374
get back the defector votes...

53:01.583 --> 53:03.749
Cuts are in the air, how can I?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.749
If it's money you need, no problem,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.249
we can buy anyone.

53:12.041 --> 53:15.165
Just do your part,
I'll deal with the rest.

53:17.416 --> 53:19.374
Got it?

53:21.625 --> 53:22.915
Yes.

53:23.125 --> 53:24.749
Say: "Okay!"

53:29.291 --> 53:30.999
Okay.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.457
Who was the girl that night?

53:40.625 --> 53:42.999
Who do you think she is? A hooker.

53:43.208 --> 53:44.832
Where does she live?

53:46.125 --> 53:47.374
No, wait...

53:47.625 --> 53:50.082
She's the only witness.

53:50.291 --> 53:51.749
No!

53:52.666 --> 53:54.999
She won't talk, won't say a thing.

54:15.458 --> 54:20.124
This is absurd! Couldn't we meet
in a more discreet place?

54:20.333 --> 54:23.457
- I feel safer here.
- What's that mean?

54:23.708 --> 54:25.457
- I'm scared of you.
- Of me?

54:25.666 --> 54:27.749
You ordered Dagger killed?

54:29.666 --> 54:31.999
How can you even think that?

54:32.166 --> 54:34.040
I know loads of things about you.

54:34.250 --> 54:36.749
I've got everything:
photos, videos...

54:37.000 --> 54:39.290
I filmed you when you slept,
when you did drugs.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.207
If anything happens to me,
I'll ruin you. You can't touch me!

54:42.416 --> 54:44.915
I didn't ask anyone to kill Dagger,

54:45.125 --> 54:48.040
it was the mistake of an asshole
from Ostia called "Number 8",

54:48.250 --> 54:50.124
what you don't understand

54:50.416 --> 54:53.124
is that someone much worse
might come after you.

54:54.791 --> 54:57.290
From now on, don't talk about me
and I won't talk about you,

54:57.500 --> 54:59.332
it's convenient for both of us.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.832
You have to go now.

55:07.916 --> 55:09.999
Don't go back home.

55:10.666 --> 55:12.374
Hear me?

55:13.083 --> 55:15.290
Don't go home.

55:52.791 --> 55:54.207
- Seba...
- Ninni!

55:54.458 --> 55:56.665
You have to help me, I'm in trouble.

55:56.875 --> 56:00.499
No, please,
you don't know the mess I'm in.

56:00.708 --> 56:03.415
- I know.
- Really, please...

56:03.666 --> 56:06.832
Please, I can't go home, I'm scared.

56:10.708 --> 56:13.332
Can I stay with you?
Just for tonight!

56:32.000 --> 56:34.915
That old guy is the great Samurai?

56:36.291 --> 56:38.707
And he goes around alone?

56:41.041 --> 56:43.874
He was the only one in the
Magliana gang my dad was scared of.

56:44.583 --> 56:45.999
Why?

56:48.083 --> 56:50.082
He knows loads of things,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.207
all the Mafias respect him.

57:32.875 --> 57:34.999
You and your family are in this deal

57:35.166 --> 57:37.874
only because it's here in Ostia,
on your turf.

57:39.416 --> 57:41.499
You worry me,

57:42.375 --> 57:46.332
you want to be the boss,
but still haven't learned how.

57:46.541 --> 57:49.249
I don't like the way you talk.

57:51.500 --> 57:55.332
I respect you,
but I want to be respected too.

57:56.791 --> 57:59.624
Because you respect me, you killed a
guy you should have just scared?

57:59.875 --> 58:02.499
He wanted in on the deal,
he told me!

58:02.708 --> 58:04.415
Don't bullshit me, Aureliano!

58:04.625 --> 58:07.707
The Anacletis don't know
a fucking thing about all this.

58:12.250 --> 58:14.707
What's all the fuss?

58:15.500 --> 58:17.999
I took a dickhead off the streets!

58:18.208 --> 58:21.540
No backtalk, just do what I say,

58:21.750 --> 58:23.540
you have to do like your father did.

58:23.750 --> 58:26.499
My father licked all the asses
of the Families of the South,

58:26.708 --> 58:28.624
I won't do it.

58:41.333 --> 58:43.582
The "Families of the South"

58:43.791 --> 58:46.415
poured millions into this deal

58:46.625 --> 58:50.124
and I'm their guarantor,
I want to work in peace.

58:54.833 --> 58:58.207
Is this big deal really coming?
We do lots of talkin'!

58:58.416 --> 59:01.415
It's happening, if we cut the shit.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.665
Can you be good
for a couple of weeks?

59:12.666 --> 59:13.999
Answer me.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.665
- I can, I can.
- I hope so, for your sake.

59:52.458 --> 59:55.290
I wanna know who he saw last night.

59:57.916 --> 01:00:00.540
Look for 'em one by one.

01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:07.999
Find them.

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:11.165
So, it was the brother of...

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:15.707
This guy that died
was Manfredi's brother.

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.332
Manfredi, the...

01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.540
The Anacletis,

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.582
the gypsies!

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:25.499
Now this guy's after me.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.207
Who, the guy from Ostia?

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.499
No, why?

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:33.915
Maybe they're two different things,

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:36.749
maybe it was a thing between gangs.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.415
Maybe you have nothing
to do with this,

01:00:40.916 --> 01:00:42.707
these guys here...

01:00:42.916 --> 01:00:45.457
I have to leave now,

01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:47.665
I have an appointment.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.040
It'll all work out, you'll see.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.415
Stay as long as you like.

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:01.082
Bye, Ninni!

01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:04.790
Bye.

01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:32.124
Is Manfredi here?

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.665
Manfredi's here?

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:42.290
I want to talk to Manfredi.

01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:44.374
Not today, come back tomorrow.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:47.457
It's really important.

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:50.582
What?

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:52.874
I know who killed Dagger.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.624
Let him in.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.874
So? How do you know who did it?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.499
A rumor.

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:36.790
I know all of Rome.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.832
Give me a name.

01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:45.874
But...

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:48.374
the villa where I work...

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:52.332
you have to let me keep it,
take the rest.

01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:56.082
I want that name right now, or
I'll throw you in the cage with him.

01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:03.165
It's a guy from Ostia,

01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:05.832
he's got a nickname...

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:07.915
What nickname?

01:03:08.583 --> 01:03:10.249
Number 8.

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:12.749
You know him?

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:20.457
Do you know why?

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:38.624
From kitten to tiger,
thanks to all the beatings,

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.999
he nearly ripped my nephew's arm off
the other day.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.082
So, you'll have him put down.

01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:47.665
No, I respect all warriors,

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.999
as long as they show me
they've got courage.

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:54.749
Now get out.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.832
So, the villa...

01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:03.665
I told you to get out,
my brother's dead, not my cat!

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:06.874
- Sorry.
- We mourn alone.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.415
Ninni!

01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:20.540
It's me!

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.332
I've been waiting so long.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:35.082
You never came back,

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.915
where were you?

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:38.999
Public relations.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.332
I'm cold.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.165
Poor thing.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.457
I'll warm you up.

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:08.999
May I?

01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:32.707
I'm going home tomorrow.

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:35.999
Why?

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.915
You can stay as long as you like,

01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:42.082
at least until they kick me out.

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:44.374
Who'll kick you out?

01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.624
No, I just meant it...

01:05:46.833 --> 01:05:48.540
as a joke.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.582
I feel good here with you.

01:06:20.375 --> 01:06:21.665
You do?

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:33.415
Can I say something stupid?

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:35.707
I do it all the time!

01:06:38.041 --> 01:06:41.749
If I'd had a brother like you,
I wouldn't be a hooker.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.207
No? Why, what else can you do?

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:48.624
- I can do lots of things.
- Like?

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:51.457
I can play hopscotch,

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:54.165
jump rope...

01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:57.665
Anything a little more... modern?

01:06:57.875 --> 01:07:00.165
I kick butt at videogames.

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:02.874
Okay, that's good.

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:20.415
Want to fuck?

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:29.374
Thanks for the thought.

01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:22.082
I can just see
this shit town all changed.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.707
All the lights,

01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:37.499
cars coming and going,
neon signs, fireworks,

01:08:37.707 --> 01:08:40.207
one big party, day and night.

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:07.290
All the skyscrapers,

01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:12.499
game rooms, slot machines, casinos...

01:09:14.166 --> 01:09:18.707
And a mile-long row of restaurants,
clubs, people having fun,

01:09:18.916 --> 01:09:21.249
top-notch pussy.

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:24.790
All rich,

01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:27.707
all beautiful.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.499
Okay.

01:10:20.541 --> 01:10:22.374
See you next week.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.165
What are you doing?

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:15.999
They're coming.

01:11:33.416 --> 01:11:36.624
We'll have to buy this guy something
or we'll look bad.

01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:05.790
Stay down!

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.999
Go!

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:33.665
Cover your face, there's cameras.

01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:52.999
Wait.

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.332
It's just a scratch.

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:29.999
Let's go.

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:41.582
My love, don't die on me here!

01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:43.415
My love!

01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:52.999
You can't leave me, please!

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:56.832
Get up!

01:15:12.166 --> 01:15:13.790
Let's go.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.082
C'mon, the cops are comin'.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.124
I'm here with you.

01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:29.415
What do we do?

01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:51.457
Mirco!

01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:53.749
Go!

01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:59.624
He can't walk, Mirco!

01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:02.790
He can't walk!

01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:06.999
Go!

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:38.749
I'm not asking you
to change your mind,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.915
just support me on
the Suburban Renewal Law.

01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:45.082
Politics has nothing to do with it,
it's about Ostia.

01:16:45.916 --> 01:16:48.915
It's a big project, if you say yes,
you'll be part of it.

01:16:49.666 --> 01:16:51.332
Meaning?

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:54.624
The firm handling
the funds for the waterfront,

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:57.999
will need a General Manager,

01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:59.915
interested?

01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:03.249
What exactly would I do?
What do you need?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.374
Your vote.

01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:11.207
I already have your friends',
a few more here and there...

01:17:11.416 --> 01:17:13.915
If you say yes, I feel more at ease.

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:23.582
It's a zoning issue,
if they break your balls,

01:17:23.791 --> 01:17:26.624
tell them the agreement was
before you left the Party.

01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:30.915
A CEO's salary?

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.540
- 500,000 a year.
- Plus benefits.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.207
Obviously.

01:17:36.416 --> 01:17:39.915
- Car with driver, trains, flights...
- Of course.

01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:43.915
Length of contract?

01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:47.332
Four years,

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:49.832
renewable.

01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:55.249
Alright.

01:18:07.666 --> 01:18:10.749
Just a few days left
to get the law passed,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.665
so we need
to free those funds, now.

01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:16.540
That's impossible,

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:19.249
it takes time to make
such large sums available...

01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:22.165
Just a few days or it all blows up.

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:25.499
I'm sorry, I really don't know
how it can be done,

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:27.582
it's impossible.

01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:32.790
Unfortunately, at this very moment,

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.540
there's something

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:39.790
bigger than me, or you,
but don't make me say it.

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:47.999
Eminence,

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:50.707
you are too intelligent

01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:54.165
not to imagine the consequences
of your attitude.

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:57.999
If the deal blows,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.790
they'll put you
at the bottom of the Tiber.

01:19:03.583 --> 01:19:06.499
And I'd rather see
a better fate for you.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.249
Alright,

01:19:15.458 --> 01:19:17.540
but, with increased risk,

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:20.457
the expected quota
will have to increase too.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.332
That's no problem at all.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:57.749
Any better?

01:20:00.291 --> 01:20:04.290
I didn't sleep all night,
this shit wound stings.

01:20:07.625 --> 01:20:11.624
You gotta change location, I got
a fishing shack set up for you,

01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:14.332
it sucks, but it's really hidden.

01:20:16.666 --> 01:20:19.749
I'm not moving,
I'd like to see if they come.

01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:24.915
They all know you're here,
it's not safe.

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:33.707
Cover her, please.

01:20:44.875 --> 01:20:46.707
When should I go?

01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:50.749
Today, then we fuck the Anacletis
up the ass.

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:55.665
They think we're freaked out,
their guard's down, and we fuck 'em!

01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:57.915
We go after them tonight.

01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:03.165
Do what you have to,
slaughter those shit gypsies!

01:21:06.125 --> 01:21:09.332
Instead, nobody does a thing,
we do nothin'.

01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:10.999
Why?

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:15.374
- I made a promise.
- To who?

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:17.790
To whoever the fuck I want.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.707
We can't let them get away with this.

01:21:20.916 --> 01:21:22.915
I make the decisions,

01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:26.374
no more fuckin' around
or it all blows up.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.082
Tell everyone to sit tight.

01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:34.457
"I am this bread from Heaven",

01:21:34.666 --> 01:21:36.707
said the Lord,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.374
"If any man eats of this bread,
he shall live forever".

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.415
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:01.707
I heard, before he died,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.665
Dagger was called by a piece of ass

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.082
who's in the big time,

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:11.124
one of those who cost.

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:15.749
That night she was in trouble,
so she called my brother.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.499
That's the shit people
you hang with, right?

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:20.540
Know her?

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:25.124
Cat got your tongue?

01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:30.332
- What do you want with her?
- Just a chat.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:35.207
Do you know her, or not?

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.290
Where is she?

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:46.999
Tell me what you want to know,
I'll talk to her.

01:22:47.208 --> 01:22:49.832
Want me pissed off in church?

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:53.249
Just tell me where she is,
don't drag your feet.

01:22:57.291 --> 01:22:59.582
Tell me where I can find her.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:09.290
She's at my place,

01:23:09.875 --> 01:23:11.707
my apartment.

01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.832
Lord, grant him eternal rest,

01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:40.540
and let Your perpetual light
shine upon them...

01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:42.999
O God, creator and redeemer

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:44.874
of all the faithful,

01:23:45.083 --> 01:23:48.915
grant the souls of the deceased
universal remission of sins.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:23.915
Seba!

01:24:58.041 --> 01:25:01.249
I just want to know the name
of the guy who was with you.

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.415
What do you care?

01:25:08.541 --> 01:25:10.457
He has nothing to do
with Dagger's death.

01:25:10.666 --> 01:25:14.290
I say he called Number 8
to get rid of a witness.

01:25:17.166 --> 01:25:19.249
He didn't call Number 8.

01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:22.665
- How do you know?
- I just do.

01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:24.874
Because I know him,

01:25:25.208 --> 01:25:28.415
he'd never even think about it.

01:25:28.625 --> 01:25:31.124
Give me his name, I'll do the rest.

01:25:38.416 --> 01:25:39.832
I...

01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:42.665
I guess you don't understand,
let's do it this way.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.290
I ask a question and you answer
or I'll cut your sweet face.

01:25:47.541 --> 01:25:50.165
- Who was it?
- He's a politician named Malgradi.

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:51.999
Malgradi?

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:54.749
I'll tell you all about him,
just don't hurt me.

01:26:35.625 --> 01:26:37.832
I can't stand just staying here,

01:26:39.458 --> 01:26:41.540
just the thought bores me.

01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.457
Get up, Viola.

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:11.374
Go take a walk!

01:27:14.916 --> 01:27:17.415
Go out, I want to be alone!

01:27:33.125 --> 01:27:35.749
Take me to Rome, I gotta get a wax.

01:27:57.458 --> 01:27:59.540
- Pull over here.
- Here?

01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:23.040
Hello.

01:28:26.208 --> 01:28:27.832
Miss?

01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:30.582
Excuse me,
do you have an appointment?

01:28:30.791 --> 01:28:33.874
Stop, Miss, please.

01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:35.999
Fuck off!

01:28:55.166 --> 01:28:56.999
Can I help you?

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:03.790
Ehi!

01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:38.374
Let's go.

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.499
C'mon!

01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:42.207
Thanks for coming.

01:30:42.416 --> 01:30:44.249
You never age,

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:47.207
I haven't seen you in ten years.

01:30:50.583 --> 01:30:53.540
Stop this mess
between you and the Ostia guys.

01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:55.707
I didn't make any mess.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.707
To kill Number 8
you almost caused a massacre.

01:30:59.666 --> 01:31:02.790
Let me remind you
he killed my brother

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:07.415
and a few hours later they wiped out
two kids I saw born.

01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:10.124
No one can stop my revenge.

01:31:10.333 --> 01:31:13.665
It's not the moment to have
a fucking war between you.

01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:17.915
I'm on a project
in the interest of the Families

01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:19.749
and I need peace and quiet.

01:31:21.125 --> 01:31:22.749
A project?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.540
What project?

01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:27.415
A project.

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:33.249
It must be a big deal
if you're in it,

01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:35.999
how come I don't know nothin'?

01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:37.915
Because it's in Ostia,

01:31:39.291 --> 01:31:41.832
it involves politics, finance.

01:31:42.083 --> 01:31:45.790
Till yesterday
you were loan sharks for nobodies.

01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:50.082
Okay, but we've grown now
and they all respect us.

01:31:50.333 --> 01:31:53.040
To your face, because you scare them,
but from behind?

01:31:54.916 --> 01:31:57.624
They still call you shit gypsies.

01:31:59.166 --> 01:32:01.790
You're still a couple of Shylocks.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.415
I don't give a fuck
about that bullshit,

01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:19.915
I just want to even up the corpses,

01:32:20.166 --> 01:32:23.999
I'm only sorry I didn't kill
Number 8 like a dog.

01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:27.832
I've told you what I had to.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:32.457
Think twice before going against me

01:32:32.666 --> 01:32:34.499
and the Families.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:00.915
You shit!

01:33:01.125 --> 01:33:03.832
You're a piece of shit!
You make me sick!

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.499
I trusted you! Fuck you!

01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:29.165
In the parties you organize,
full of pussy and dirty politicians,

01:33:29.375 --> 01:33:32.290
have you ever heard talk
of this project?

01:33:32.625 --> 01:33:35.540
If you tell me who's behind it,
I'll give you your villa back.

01:33:40.125 --> 01:33:43.040
Of course I've heard about it,
it's a huge project,

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:47.082
they want to make
a kind of Las Vegas in Ostia:

01:33:47.291 --> 01:33:48.415
casinos...

01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:52.749
A group has been pushing for months,
but approval is set for next year.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.165
It's for now, they did something
to move up the project.

01:33:57.375 --> 01:33:59.499
That's something I don't know.

01:33:59.708 --> 01:34:01.915
To push it through,
they need a politician,

01:34:02.125 --> 01:34:04.790
it might be this Malgradi.

01:34:05.041 --> 01:34:06.040
Aida!

01:34:06.250 --> 01:34:08.082
I'm working.

01:34:09.541 --> 01:34:10.999
Malgradi?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.082
Maybe.

01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:17.374
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

01:34:21.583 --> 01:34:24.415
Get out, all of you,
you've pissed me off!

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:29.040
You're driving me nuts!
Know what, I'm leaving!

01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:31.249
Let's go, come with me.

01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:35.915
Fuckin' bastards!

01:34:36.166 --> 01:34:38.790
You're just fuckin' bastards!

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.499
Damned them!

01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:54.457
You fuck off too!

01:34:54.666 --> 01:34:56.374
You walking shitter!

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:17.665
I'd like to call on this politician,
know where he lives?

01:35:20.083 --> 01:35:21.499
Yes.

01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:24.415
- What do you mean by "call on"?
- A courtesy call.

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:26.540
Has he got a bodyguard?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.707
He has a driver,
but no bodyguard, why?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.665
Let's go, move.

01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:43.165
This building, top floor.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.040
- Perfect.
- He lives here.

01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:48.915
Let's go!

01:35:49.208 --> 01:35:52.499
- Give me time to walk away.
- You're coming too.

01:35:52.708 --> 01:35:55.874
You talk better than me,
you talk to him.

01:35:56.083 --> 01:36:01.082
All the times we crossed paths
at parties? He'll recognize me!

01:36:01.291 --> 01:36:03.999
See? He won't recognize you now.

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:08.665
Is this a joke?

01:36:08.916 --> 01:36:11.540
Don't piss me off!

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:14.457
You can't go, you're in this like us.

01:36:14.833 --> 01:36:19.040
You gotta get dirty,
so you don't go running to the cops.

01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:35.874
What's going on?

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:38.499
Stop, you piece of shit!

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:41.874
What do you want?
Please don't hurt us!

01:36:42.125 --> 01:36:43.999
Shut up!

01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:46.249
Give them everything, please!

01:36:46.916 --> 01:36:51.124
Now listen to what
this friend of mine says

01:36:51.333 --> 01:36:54.165
and answer him straight.
Say you will.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.082
Say you will!

01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:57.790
- Yes.
- Louder!

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.124
- Yes.
- Come here.

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.999
C'mon!

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.290
The bill for the construction
of all those hotels,

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.499
the casinos and the Olympic
structures at the beaches of Ostia

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:10.457
is going to pass now, right?

01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:13.040
We're talking about the "Waterfront",
right?

01:37:13.625 --> 01:37:17.165
Is it true you're the one
getting this law passed?

01:37:18.166 --> 01:37:20.665
- Is it you or not?
- I'm in it too.

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:24.999
- Mommy!
- Sweetie, stay away, it's nothing!

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.332
Shut up!

01:37:28.333 --> 01:37:29.999
Look at me!

01:37:30.208 --> 01:37:33.124
Do you know me? Get a good look!

01:37:33.333 --> 01:37:36.332
- Know me? Know who I am?
- No, I don't.

01:37:36.583 --> 01:37:39.082
I'm the brother
of the guy you had killed,

01:37:39.291 --> 01:37:41.124
Dagger's brother.

01:37:41.333 --> 01:37:43.665
- I didn't do...
- Filthy rat!

01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:47.082
He's gone
and you're still here breathing,

01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:49.790
so listen up good:

01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:52.582
you gotta block this fucking law

01:37:53.125 --> 01:37:57.332
and tell your bosses at the top
we want a cut of 20%.

01:37:57.583 --> 01:37:59.665
20%.

01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:03.332
Tell 'em that, do like I say.

01:38:03.583 --> 01:38:06.457
And just to be sure, lovely lady,

01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:08.790
we're takin' this little toy,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.249
and if you call the cops,

01:38:11.458 --> 01:38:13.999
the toy could get broken.

01:38:14.208 --> 01:38:16.290
It could get broken!

01:38:31.833 --> 01:38:34.332
You're sure you just
put him to sleep?

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:37.290
Don't worry, he's all yours now.

01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:39.249
Meaning?

01:38:39.458 --> 01:38:43.207
Keep an eye on him and tell me
if there are problems.

01:38:43.416 --> 01:38:44.832
But...

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:49.540
How do I figure into this?
I can't do it!

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:53.582
You're mine now, I'll do
what the fuck I want with you.

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:58.999
Now take me to your house,
we'll hide the kid there.

01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:15.249
Pippo!

01:39:15.458 --> 01:39:17.290
I have to talk to him.

01:39:18.875 --> 01:39:20.540
- Good evening.
- Get lost.

01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:22.665
- Who the fuck...
- Get lost!

01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:26.082
Go, out!
You guys too, out!

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:31.207
What happened?

01:39:31.416 --> 01:39:34.707
Manfredi Anacleti came to my house
and kidnapped my son,

01:39:34.916 --> 01:39:37.249
you said you'd protect me.

01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:41.415
You didn't do a fucking thing,
so our deal is off!

01:39:43.125 --> 01:39:45.582
I'll bring him home, just relax.

01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:47.499
I won't 'just relax',

01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:50.415
I don't believe anything or anyone
anymore, especially you,

01:39:50.625 --> 01:39:54.374
you can shove the law up your ass,
shove it up your ass!

01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:58.290
Pippo, you don't have to do anything,
just calm down

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.374
and listen to me.

01:40:00.583 --> 01:40:04.332
Go home, go stay with your wife.

01:40:06.791 --> 01:40:09.332
What did he ask in exchange?

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:14.540
He wants a cut of the deal,

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:17.457
20%.

01:40:19.125 --> 01:40:21.415
I'll fix this thing for you,

01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:25.374
nothing will happen to your son!

01:40:58.833 --> 01:41:00.707
Don't get any closer.

01:41:00.916 --> 01:41:02.415
C'mon!

01:41:03.708 --> 01:41:05.540
Don't complain,

01:41:07.166 --> 01:41:10.665
another guy would throw you off
the bridge for the shit you pulled.

01:41:14.708 --> 01:41:16.165
What do you think?

01:41:17.416 --> 01:41:20.332
We're playing cops and robbers,
havin' fun?

01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:22.124
Not one fucking bit!

01:41:24.916 --> 01:41:28.290
Any bullshit, the millions go
and we get years in jail.

01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:33.165
- We can't always let it go.
- What the fuck do you know?

01:41:41.208 --> 01:41:43.290
You made a mess!

01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:46.790
I evened the score for you, didn't I?

01:41:47.083 --> 01:41:50.082
Now it's World War 3
against the gypsies!

01:41:50.333 --> 01:41:52.207
It's my fault?

01:41:53.333 --> 01:41:55.207
Yeah, it's your fault.

01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.207
Careful!

01:42:30.416 --> 01:42:31.832
Careful!

01:42:33.333 --> 01:42:36.249
Go! On my three: one, two, pull!

01:42:38.708 --> 01:42:40.207
Careful!

01:42:58.791 --> 01:43:01.290
A grim chance discovery:

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.749
the body of a woman
was found this morning

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.332
at the bottom of a man-made lake
on the outskirts of Rome.

01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:10.499
Giving the alarm
were the maintenance men

01:43:10.708 --> 01:43:13.082
charged with emptying the basin.

01:43:13.291 --> 01:43:16.082
Police are investigating,
little news has leaked out,

01:43:16.291 --> 01:43:19.624
but it seems it's the body
of a very young woman.

01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:21.790
At first examination

01:43:22.041 --> 01:43:26.082
the body may have been
in the water for 3 or 4 days,

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:28.915
but autopsy results are needed.

01:43:29.125 --> 01:43:31.915
The man-made pool of water

01:43:32.166 --> 01:43:34.624
is located in the outskirts
to the south of the capital.

01:43:34.833 --> 01:43:37.457
It's hard to find eyewitnesses,

01:43:37.666 --> 01:43:40.832
the entire area is abandoned...

01:43:46.791 --> 01:43:49.332
I know, what we did was shit.

01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:54.165
So, how do we fix it?

01:43:54.375 --> 01:43:58.124
I made an agreement with Manfredi,
he's in the project now

01:43:58.333 --> 01:44:01.249
and to pay for the deaths you
caused, he'll take part of your cut.

01:44:01.458 --> 01:44:04.165
- No way, this isn't their turf!
- I've already decided.

01:44:04.375 --> 01:44:06.040
That's just great,

01:44:06.250 --> 01:44:10.415
but I've been working my ass off for
a year getting villas and lands sold.

01:44:13.333 --> 01:44:17.082
I'd say you can just go to Manfredi
and say the deal's off.

01:44:19.625 --> 01:44:22.790
And the junkie...
you gotta give her to me.

01:44:39.583 --> 01:44:41.832
Hands off Viola, she's my stuff.

01:44:44.875 --> 01:44:47.707
And don't call her that,
it bothers me.

01:44:50.166 --> 01:44:53.707
So, no junkie
and no deal with Manfredi?

01:45:00.666 --> 01:45:02.332
Exactly.

01:45:04.458 --> 01:45:07.999
Anyway, you know nothing moves
in Ostia without my okay

01:45:11.625 --> 01:45:14.332
and that I'm not like my father,

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:18.290
so I don't give a fuck who you are,
who you were, what you represent,

01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:22.749
you're a total nobody to me.

01:45:25.416 --> 01:45:26.832
You were...

01:45:28.541 --> 01:45:30.415
But this is today!

01:45:34.166 --> 01:45:35.790
You were

01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:39.582
and I am.

01:46:55.583 --> 01:46:57.040
Move!

01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.582
Gettin' some sun?

01:50:23.916 --> 01:50:25.999
Have you all voted?

01:50:26.208 --> 01:50:27.457
Have you?

01:50:27.666 --> 01:50:29.540
May I close?

01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:31.624
Voting is closed.

01:50:34.125 --> 01:50:37.540
In favor 380, against 26.

01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:40.749
The Chamber approves.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.457
It passed!

01:50:43.833 --> 01:50:45.540
It passed.

01:51:09.166 --> 01:51:10.249
Hello?

01:51:15.666 --> 01:51:17.082
Hello?

01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:20.707
Hello.

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:24.707
It passed, give me back the doll.

01:51:26.791 --> 01:51:28.290
Where...

01:51:29.125 --> 01:51:30.540
Hello?

01:51:47.041 --> 01:51:49.124
All okay,

01:51:49.333 --> 01:51:51.415
the kid's fine.

01:51:54.125 --> 01:51:56.415
My work's done, right?

01:51:56.625 --> 01:52:00.999
Tell me tomorrow,
I gotta go now, my family is waiting.

01:52:01.208 --> 01:52:02.832
About that promise...

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.915
I told you I'm goin' now.

01:52:05.166 --> 01:52:07.874
It's just a second,
all I need are the keys.

01:52:08.125 --> 01:52:11.415
I'll decide when I have a second
and now I don't.

01:52:12.416 --> 01:52:14.915
What's that mean?
You've got one now!

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.832
I'm asking you for what's mine!

01:52:18.083 --> 01:52:20.374
I did it all, everything!

01:52:20.583 --> 01:52:22.665
Raising your voice in my house?

01:52:22.875 --> 01:52:25.165
What's yours?

01:52:25.375 --> 01:52:29.582
I need the villa to work,
understand? You owe me!

01:52:29.791 --> 01:52:32.415
Most I can do is offer you a job.

01:52:32.625 --> 01:52:34.832
I don't want it, I want what's mine!

01:52:35.125 --> 01:52:36.999
You don't have a fucking thing.

01:52:39.041 --> 01:52:41.124
How the fuck can you be this way?

01:52:41.333 --> 01:52:43.332
You piece of shit!

01:52:43.583 --> 01:52:45.415
You rat, you scum!

01:52:45.666 --> 01:52:48.665
Want to die?

01:52:49.916 --> 01:52:52.124
Want to die?

01:53:01.583 --> 01:53:02.582
Throw him out!

01:53:12.458 --> 01:53:15.457
- Well, satisfied?
- In your opinion?

01:53:15.916 --> 01:53:18.999
I hope yours is the start
of a political change of heart.

01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:20.999
Go slow, a step at a time.

01:53:21.208 --> 01:53:24.999
You sign the contract tomorrow,
I got you what you asked for.

01:53:25.166 --> 01:53:27.832
You won't be sorry
for the choice you made.

01:53:28.666 --> 01:53:30.332
Congratulations!

01:53:30.541 --> 01:53:32.999
I didn't think you could pull it off.

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:35.540
You're not the only one.

01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:38.624
Now can we stop warring in the Party?

01:53:38.833 --> 01:53:42.665
From tomorrow we work side by side,
even in your nice foundation.

01:53:42.875 --> 01:53:44.832
I await you with open arms!

01:53:45.083 --> 01:53:46.915
Let's have something to eat.

01:53:51.166 --> 01:53:52.999
How are you?

01:53:53.291 --> 01:53:55.665
Thanks for coming,
I'm glad to have you here.

01:53:55.875 --> 01:53:59.665
I'd rather not be here,
I don't have good news.

01:54:00.541 --> 01:54:03.665
I just received a tip about you
from the DA's office.

01:54:03.875 --> 01:54:05.540
The DA's office?

01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:07.999
They want to issue an arrest warrant

01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:10.624
to the presidential offices
of Parliament.

01:54:11.333 --> 01:54:13.415
An arrest warrant?

01:54:14.166 --> 01:54:15.582
That's absurd.

01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:18.874
Well, it concerns a dead girl.

01:54:19.666 --> 01:54:23.499
I got mixed up in that by chance,
I didn't even know the girl.

01:54:24.875 --> 01:54:26.499
I'm not the one to convince!

01:54:26.708 --> 01:54:29.124
They're investigating a night
of drugs, and sex with a minor.

01:54:29.375 --> 01:54:31.207
Listen,

01:54:31.458 --> 01:54:33.082
you know what?

01:54:33.583 --> 01:54:36.290
As things stand, in this country,

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:39.999
a guy like me,
who's gotten where he is,

01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:42.915
and arrived where I've arrived,

01:54:43.166 --> 01:54:45.832
can tell the Judiciary to fuck off!

01:54:46.083 --> 01:54:48.999
I'm a Member of the Parliament
of the Republic of Italy.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.082
They can shove it up their ass!

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.999
- You know I'm always here for you.
- Thank you.

01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:59.332
This is nothing personal.

01:55:29.875 --> 01:55:33.374
This is the Norwegian salmon
that our friend orders.

01:55:34.833 --> 01:55:36.040
Fuck!

01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:38.707
- Everything okay?
- Excuse me.

01:56:08.875 --> 01:56:12.499
At 8:30, after the Chamber's final
approval of the Budget...

01:56:12.708 --> 01:56:14.540
Could you turn up the radio?

01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:17.290
The Prime Minister will present his
resignation to President Napolitano.

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:20.999
The Budget
has received final approval,

01:56:21.250 --> 01:56:22.665
we await the resignation,

01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:25.374
then the Head of State
will begin consultations.

01:56:25.625 --> 01:56:28.624
For the outgoing Prime Minister,
many meetings,

01:56:28.833 --> 01:56:31.457
starting with one
with his probable successor.

01:56:31.666 --> 01:56:34.374
Annamaria dear, this is Malgradi,
would you put the Prim...

01:56:34.583 --> 01:56:36.665
Filippo Malgradi.

01:56:36.875 --> 01:56:39.165
Put the Prime Minister on, please?

01:56:40.833 --> 01:56:43.540
I have to speak to him
before he leaves.

01:56:47.708 --> 01:56:51.457
Annamaria, if we go to elections,
he's not risking alone, we all are.

01:56:52.833 --> 01:56:56.832
If we go to early elections,
my seat has to be secure.

01:56:57.833 --> 01:56:59.749
Five minutes and I'll be...

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.999
Damned fucking slut!

01:57:08.291 --> 01:57:12.999
A small crowd has gathered before
Montecitorio and Palazzo Chigi....

01:57:16.875 --> 01:57:18.499
Dirty crooks!

01:57:20.458 --> 01:57:21.874
What's all this?

01:57:22.083 --> 01:57:24.499
Piazza Colonna is closed off,
people are standing, waiting,

01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:26.582
their eyes
on the entrance to Palazzo Chigi.

01:57:26.791 --> 01:57:27.999
What's happening?

01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:30.332
Good evening, it's all closed-off.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.415
Look...

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.457
- The Prime Minister's waiting for me.
- Sorry, it's all blocked.

01:57:54.208 --> 01:57:56.290
Sorry, excuse me.

01:57:59.875 --> 01:58:03.499
Resign, resign...

01:58:08.625 --> 01:58:10.915
Excuse me, I must get through!

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.249
Excuse me, sorry!

01:58:14.458 --> 01:58:17.374
Malgradi, you crook!

01:58:17.583 --> 01:58:20.499
Go home, at your age.

01:58:21.916 --> 01:58:23.999
Let me through, please!

01:58:24.875 --> 01:58:26.082
Excuse me!

01:58:26.625 --> 01:58:28.499
Don't shout, I can hear you!

01:58:28.708 --> 01:58:31.165
No need to yell, I can hear you!

01:58:31.416 --> 01:58:32.832
Go home!

01:58:33.041 --> 01:58:34.749
Excuse me, sorry.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.999
Will you let me through?

01:58:46.833 --> 01:58:48.582
The Prime Minister is waiting for me!

01:58:49.083 --> 01:58:52.249
Will you let me through?
I must see the Prime Minister!

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.707
Mr. Prime Minister!

01:58:54.916 --> 01:58:56.915
Mr. Prime Minister, we have to talk!

01:58:57.125 --> 01:58:58.999
They're attacking us!

01:58:59.166 --> 01:59:01.374
Mr. President, you mustn't resign!

01:59:01.625 --> 01:59:03.707
The Judiciary, Mr. Prime Minister!

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.290
I have to be re-elected!

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.707
It doesn't matter.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.457
Anyway, he got the law passed,
didn't he?

02:03:36.375 --> 02:03:38.249
If there are new elections,

02:03:38.458 --> 02:03:40.457
we'll find a politician,

02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:43.915
maybe on the other side.

02:03:44.125 --> 02:03:45.332
Yeah.

02:03:59.458 --> 02:04:01.082
Are you leaving already?

02:04:01.291 --> 02:04:02.707
Yes.

02:04:04.875 --> 02:04:06.707
But I'll come by tomorrow.

02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:10.457
Mom, the cake?
You didn't even taste it,

02:04:10.666 --> 02:04:13.165
I went all the way
to the Kosher shop to get it.

02:04:13.791 --> 02:04:16.290
I don't like anything anymore.

02:04:17.083 --> 02:04:18.790
You're tellin' me!

02:04:20.833 --> 02:04:22.915
I have to make such an effort.

02:04:27.708 --> 02:04:29.624
It's raining so hard.

02:04:30.541 --> 02:04:33.832
- Wait a while.
- I'm all covered up.

02:04:34.583 --> 02:04:36.874
- Want me to eat some?
- Just a little.

02:04:37.083 --> 02:04:39.790
- How much? A lot or a little?
- A little.

02:04:41.666 --> 02:04:43.165
Like this?

02:04:45.041 --> 02:04:47.540
- Are you glad?
- Good girl.

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:49.582
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

02:05:31.666 --> 02:05:33.874
You're making a mistake.

02:05:36.708 --> 02:05:38.124
Move.

02:06:14.875 --> 02:06:17.499
I want to make a deal.

02:06:17.916 --> 02:06:19.832
A deal?

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.040
- With me?
- Yes, with you.

02:06:27.125 --> 02:06:29.124
Next time.

02:10:01.166 --> 02:10:03.374
For my father

02:10:04.305 --> 02:10:10.497
