your college years? Huh?

20:01.721 --> 20:04.155
Looking like some common
gdi pieces of shit?

20:05.825 --> 20:07.135
You should be
fucking ten's, Billy,

20:07.159 --> 20:08.793
not six's!

20:08.828 --> 20:10.906
Do you have any idea
how much it breaks my heart

20:10.930 --> 20:12.663
to see you fuck a six?

20:12.698 --> 20:14.232
[Sighs]

20:14.267 --> 20:16.468
Hey, I'm right here.

20:19.238 --> 20:22.573
Guys, we are the last
remaining alphas.

20:22.608 --> 20:24.909
If we don't make this right,
we're disappearing.

20:26.579 --> 20:29.046
I can't let that happen, Billy.

20:29.081 --> 20:31.015
What do you say?

20:31.050 --> 20:33.684
I'm with you, Charlie.

20:33.719 --> 20:35.239
- Billy?
- Fuck.

20:37.924 --> 20:39.201
[Groans] All right, fine.

20:39.225 --> 20:41.069
But if anything happens
to my ballsack,

20:41.093 --> 20:42.804
fucking paper cut,
I'mma murder you.

20:42.828 --> 20:44.161
Deal.

20:44.196 --> 20:46.698
I'd love to fuck a six.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.535
A duel?

20:50.570 --> 20:52.047
I'm not falling
for that bullshit.

20:52.071 --> 20:54.672
- Nice try.
- It's not bullshit, AJ.

20:54.707 --> 20:56.741
It's fancy,
leather-bound, and legit.

20:56.776 --> 21:00.811
[Clears throat] "Should
he, the shit-sandwich,"

21:00.846 --> 21:03.180
that's you, AJ, "refuse to duel"

21:03.215 --> 21:04.860
and the challenging fraternity,"

21:04.884 --> 21:09.587
that's us, "will
automatically be reinstated."

21:09.622 --> 21:11.289
So...

21:11.324 --> 21:12.757
What's it gonna be?

21:20.299 --> 21:22.277
This is fucked, dude.
I look like a fucking asshole.

21:22.301 --> 21:24.302
You don't look like
a fucking asshole.

21:24.337 --> 21:26.582
- Yes, I look like a fucking asshole!
- I'm sorry, okay?

21:26.606 --> 21:28.350
Your old uniform is all
I could find on short notice.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.674
You look great.

21:31.143 --> 21:32.621
- [Uniform tearing]
- Ugh!

21:32.645 --> 21:34.056
Fuck, Charlie,
I can't fucking do this.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.346
You can and you will.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.747
[Sword swooshing]

21:36.782 --> 21:38.627
Shoulda done
your homework, Charlie.

21:38.651 --> 21:41.752
I'm a four-time national
fencing world champion.

21:41.787 --> 21:43.599
- Okay, you got your cup on, right?
- Yes, yes.

21:43.623 --> 21:45.601
I have my fucking cup
and I lost a testicle fencing.

21:45.625 --> 21:46.969
How am I gonna forget
my fucking cup

21:46.993 --> 21:48.604
on the fucking fencing field,
god damn it?

21:48.628 --> 21:49.972
Okay, I'm sorry. Good. Listen.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.607
You need two points
and we got this thing

21:51.631 --> 21:52.597
home free, all right?

21:52.632 --> 21:53.864
Give 'em hell out there.

21:53.899 --> 21:55.277
Here you go. Ready?

21:55.301 --> 21:57.835
Get your face in there.

21:57.870 --> 21:59.136
Ready pretty boy?

21:59.171 --> 22:01.706
Whoever gets two
out of three points wins.

22:01.741 --> 22:03.218
Only hits in the chest
and face count.

22:03.242 --> 22:04.987
- No cheap shots.
- Hey, that's the same thing

22:05.011 --> 22:06.321
your mom tells me after I finish

22:06.345 --> 22:08.223
- busting all over her.
- Exact same rules.

22:08.247 --> 22:09.681
On the count of three.

22:11.117 --> 22:13.250
- One, two...
- Stop!

22:13.285 --> 22:14.785
[Crowd groans]

22:14.820 --> 22:16.398
I demand to know
what is going on here!

22:16.422 --> 22:18.266
Dean Kravitz,
I can explain everything.

22:18.290 --> 22:20.157
- Okay?
- [Clears throat]

22:20.192 --> 22:22.304
"Any disbarred fraternity
can officially challenge"...

22:22.328 --> 22:24.695
"Challenge
the fraternity president

22:24.730 --> 22:26.208
to a duel of their choice."

22:26.232 --> 22:27.398
Yes, of course.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.001
The 1876 Mason-Dixon
duel clause.

22:30.036 --> 22:32.370
You know about this?

22:32.405 --> 22:34.705
Dean Kravitz, sir,
Alpha Chi Gamma

22:34.740 --> 22:36.318
is an institution
at this school,

22:36.342 --> 22:37.742
and if we disappear,

22:37.777 --> 22:39.744
that legacy disappears with it.

22:39.779 --> 22:42.380
I owe it to my brothers,
past, present, and future,

22:42.415 --> 22:44.255
to put Billy here in harms way

22:44.283 --> 22:45.717
so that doesn't happen.

22:47.386 --> 22:49.687
- The clause stands!
- Yes!

22:49.722 --> 22:51.990
But under one condition,
Charlie.

22:56.896 --> 22:58.362
Oh, good.

22:58.397 --> 23:01.265
I finally get to fire
this thing.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.268
One, two...

23:04.303 --> 23:05.847
- Three!
- [Loud bang]

23:05.871 --> 23:07.315
- [Crowd gasps]
- Jesus!

23:07.339 --> 23:09.373
- Amazing.
- Come on, Billy.

23:09.408 --> 23:10.941
Come on, AJ!

23:10.976 --> 23:12.721
All right, you little bitch,
here we go.

23:12.745 --> 23:14.745
- [Swords clinking]
- [Grunting]

23:14.780 --> 23:16.247
Hey, let's go, baby!

23:16.282 --> 23:19.283
[Woman] I love your sword, baby.

23:19.318 --> 23:21.919
- Come on, Billy.
- [Laughs]

23:21.954 --> 23:24.433
Rook, you look like a used tampon.
[Laughs]

23:24.457 --> 23:26.134
Well, AJ, as it turns out,

23:26.158 --> 23:28.392
your mom has not hit menopause.

23:28.427 --> 23:30.038
[Charlie] Come on,
now, here we go.

23:30.062 --> 23:31.896
- Huh!
- Ow!

23:31.931 --> 23:35.099
- God damn, you son of a bitch!
- Point Kappa Nu!

23:35.134 --> 23:37.902
- [Crowd gasps]
- Fucking love that.

23:37.937 --> 23:39.815
- All right, let's go.
- Come on, Billy.

23:39.839 --> 23:42.873
- You got this.
- Okay, come on, now, Billy.

23:42.908 --> 23:45.309
En garde, motherfucker! Woo!

23:45.344 --> 23:47.089
- I'm Zorro.
- Come on, Billy!

23:47.113 --> 23:48.724
- Come on, AJ!
- Bring it, motherfucker.

23:48.748 --> 23:50.982
- Bring it.
- Come on, Billy.

23:59.158 --> 24:00.991
Ugh! Fuck!

24:01.026 --> 24:02.860
- Point Alpha!
- Fuck it.

24:02.895 --> 24:05.096
- [Crowd gasps]
- Shit! That's cool!

24:05.131 --> 24:07.042
- Final round, gentlemen!
- All right, let's go.

24:07.066 --> 24:09.934
- It's fucking on, motherfucker.
- Let's do this.

24:09.969 --> 24:14.338
You got this, AJ. Come on, baby.

24:14.373 --> 24:16.274
Just get 'em, baby.
That's right.

24:18.844 --> 24:21.312
- Oh, bitch, what. Ugh!
- [Pants tearing]

24:21.347 --> 24:23.781
- [Crowd groans]
- Oh, my nut!

24:23.816 --> 24:25.750
That's it! You've got him now!

24:25.785 --> 24:27.262
Oh, shit! My ball!

24:27.286 --> 24:29.064
That's mine, bitch.
Your nut is fucking mine.

24:29.088 --> 24:30.855
Not my ball.

24:30.890 --> 24:32.757
[Both grunting]

24:32.792 --> 24:36.127
Protect yourself, now.
Protect yourself.

24:36.162 --> 24:38.095
Cover for it.

24:38.130 --> 24:39.797
- No!
- Yes!

24:39.832 --> 24:41.510
Eat my tip, trust fund baby.

24:41.534 --> 24:44.068
- [Crowd groans]
- Shit!

24:44.103 --> 24:46.782
[Aj] It's fucking bullshit.
God damn it!

24:46.806 --> 24:49.073
Alpha is victorious!

24:49.108 --> 24:51.475
[Crowd gasps]

24:51.510 --> 24:53.355
- Fuck, yeah!
- I told you you could do it.

24:53.379 --> 24:55.390
- I told you. -Yeah, I still
fucking hate you, though.

24:55.414 --> 24:56.947
This is bullshit!

24:56.982 --> 24:58.260
- I can't lose!
- It's okay, baby.

24:58.284 --> 25:00.061
The library
has my fucking name on it.

25:00.085 --> 25:01.786
- Oh, my god.
- Fuck!

25:01.821 --> 25:04.488
Billy, you're quite
the master swordsman.

25:04.523 --> 25:06.034
Charlie, gather up your brothers

25:06.058 --> 25:08.192
onto this glorious field
of battle

25:08.227 --> 25:12.096
and prepare to be
officially reinstated.

25:12.131 --> 25:14.176
All my brothers are present
and accounted for, sir.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.300
Let the reinstating commence.

25:16.335 --> 25:19.347
Charlie, you can't have a fraternity
with only three active members.

25:19.371 --> 25:20.871
Fucking idiot.

25:20.906 --> 25:22.807
Then we'll get more.

25:22.842 --> 25:24.452
Rush doesn't end
for another five days, right?

25:24.476 --> 25:26.188
Just give us till
the end of the week,

25:26.212 --> 25:28.490
and we will get however many
bid cards you require.

25:28.514 --> 25:30.181
Okay, Charlie.

25:30.216 --> 25:33.050
If you can muster up
15 active members

25:33.085 --> 25:34.485
before the end of rush,

25:34.520 --> 25:37.221
then I'll officially
reinstate axg.

25:37.256 --> 25:39.456
Twelve fucking pledges?
That's impossible.

25:39.491 --> 25:41.559
- Do I hear 16?
- Fifteen it is, sir.

25:41.594 --> 25:43.427
Fifteen it is.

25:43.462 --> 25:46.363
Dean Kravitz, we're gonna need

25:46.398 --> 25:48.543
kind of a central headquarters
to rally the troops.

25:48.567 --> 25:50.612
Can we have the Alpha house
for rush purposes?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.469
Like custer at the alamo.

25:52.504 --> 25:55.105
Okay, Charlie, fine.

25:55.140 --> 25:56.885
But given Alpha house's
track record,

25:56.909 --> 25:58.286
you have to promise to maintain

25:58.310 --> 26:00.511
a level of decency
that will always reflect

26:00.546 --> 26:03.581
on this school
in a positive light.

26:03.616 --> 26:05.583
- Gotcha.
- One screw up, you're done.

26:05.618 --> 26:07.262
- Loud and clear.
- You understand?

26:07.286 --> 26:09.166
- Yes sir, loud and clear.
- Good.

26:13.592 --> 26:16.193
- Take your sword.
- Thank you.

26:16.228 --> 26:19.496
Boys, we got the house back.

26:19.531 --> 26:20.998
Hell yeah!

26:21.033 --> 26:22.300
[Music playing]

26:27.139 --> 26:28.550
I mean, I did. I kicked his ass.

26:28.574 --> 26:30.452
- I just don't get tired.
- Boys.

26:30.476 --> 26:33.577
I hold in my hand
the key to Greek life.

26:33.612 --> 26:36.113
- And we owe it all to Billy.
- Yes, we do.

26:36.148 --> 26:38.193
Yeah, you know I couldn't
have done it without you guys.

26:38.217 --> 26:39.984
Oh, wait, no.

26:40.019 --> 26:42.219
I did it completely
without you guys.

26:42.254 --> 26:43.565
Did you see the look
on AJ's face?

26:43.589 --> 26:45.433
I thought he was gonna shit
his pants.

26:45.457 --> 26:47.369
- I made it my lock screen.
- [All laughing]

26:47.393 --> 26:50.027
Hey, to Billy, huh?

26:50.062 --> 26:52.229
For risking his last testicle.

26:52.264 --> 26:54.331
Boys, get ready to be ball deep

26:54.366 --> 26:55.566
in some sorority hooha.

26:55.601 --> 26:57.321
- Oh...
- [Music playing]

27:05.678 --> 27:07.945
Oh, my god.

27:07.980 --> 27:09.291
Katie littleton
just smiled at me.

27:09.315 --> 27:10.959
No, that was definitely
a facial tick.

27:10.983 --> 27:12.983
Billy, come on,

27:13.018 --> 27:15.630
I know the difference between a
facial tick and a smile, I do.

27:15.654 --> 27:18.289
- What're you smiling at?
- That was a facial tick.

27:18.324 --> 27:21.125
Whatever. Fuck you guys.

27:23.662 --> 27:25.307
[Sighs] Home, sweet, home.

27:25.331 --> 27:27.932
Maybe the inside's not so bad.

27:33.172 --> 27:34.382
Oh. [Coughs]

27:34.406 --> 27:37.408
[Gasps] Wheel of fellatio!

27:37.443 --> 27:40.577
- She survived.
- Welcome home, boys.

27:40.612 --> 27:43.580
Jesus, it's dustier than
douchenozzle's cock in here.

27:43.615 --> 27:46.294
[Sighs] Nothing 12 new
pledges can't clean up.

27:46.318 --> 27:48.452
And how we gonna get
them pledges, chuckles?

27:48.487 --> 27:50.999
Rush has already started and
nobody even knows we're back yet.

27:51.023 --> 27:53.157
Yeah, that's true.

27:53.192 --> 27:55.059
That's true, Billy, but, uh,

27:55.094 --> 27:56.593
we're gonna have a party.

27:56.628 --> 27:59.563
Hell, I think it's time
we tell 'em we're back.

27:59.598 --> 28:01.732
Oh, fuck.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.712
Yeah, I'm fixin'
to get wilder than a buck.

28:03.736 --> 28:05.402
I'mma fuck you up, liver.

28:05.437 --> 28:07.282
You hear me talkin' to you,
you little bitch?

28:07.306 --> 28:09.517
- I just hope I get laid. -That
you will, douche. We all will.

28:09.541 --> 28:11.486
Everybody remembers
how awesome our parties were.

28:11.510 --> 28:12.721
- We're legends.
- Boom.

28:12.745 --> 28:14.946
- [Screams]
- [Music playing]

28:19.385 --> 28:21.953
I honestly thought
somebody would've remembered.

28:23.055 --> 28:24.455
This sucks ass.

28:26.225 --> 28:28.392
Hey, you know what?
Let's just be patient.

28:28.427 --> 28:30.427
Only losers arrive early, right?

28:30.462 --> 28:32.096
So, we're good.

28:32.131 --> 28:34.064
- We're good.
- Hey!

28:34.099 --> 28:37.234
Ease up on the fucking dip
there, champ.

28:37.269 --> 28:39.370
[Doorbell rings, doorknob turns]

28:39.405 --> 28:41.672
[Door closes]

28:41.707 --> 28:43.374
- Hey.
- Hey, y'all.

28:43.409 --> 28:44.652
- Hi.
- Oh, Becca.

28:44.676 --> 28:46.343
It's so good to see you.

28:46.378 --> 28:48.356
I surprised the coven
let you out for the night.

28:48.380 --> 28:52.616
I heard you guys were throwing
one of your legendary parties.

28:52.651 --> 28:55.519
So, I thought I'd come by
and see for myself.

28:56.655 --> 28:59.590
You looking at something?

28:59.625 --> 29:01.025
May I please take you

29:01.060 --> 29:02.537
and your two delicious friends
here

29:02.561 --> 29:05.029
- for a tour of the house?
- Absolutely.

29:05.064 --> 29:06.775
- Right this way, my lady.
- No, not so touchy.

29:06.799 --> 29:09.377
- Okay, okay.
- He's a real charmer, isn't he?

29:09.401 --> 29:10.501
Yeah, he is, really.

29:10.536 --> 29:11.746
They're perfect for each other.

29:11.770 --> 29:14.071
Yes, she's something.

29:14.106 --> 29:15.550
I dreamed
that my days as a sigma

29:15.574 --> 29:17.085
would be
a little bit more redeeming,

29:17.109 --> 29:18.319
but Becca's idea of philanthropy

29:18.343 --> 29:20.055
is giving the school stds.

29:20.079 --> 29:22.413
I would tell Billy that,
but he wouldn't give a shit.

29:22.448 --> 29:24.314
- So...
- Oh, no.

29:24.349 --> 29:25.527
Well, I do have to say, Charlie,

29:25.551 --> 29:27.684
this is quite the terrible party

29:27.719 --> 29:30.432
- You've thrown here.
- No, I honestly thought more people
would come.

29:30.456 --> 29:33.323
Two losers and ranch dip
ain't gonna cut it.

29:33.358 --> 29:34.758
Oh, don't sweat it.

29:34.793 --> 29:36.571
You're just getting
your Greek legs back.

29:36.595 --> 29:38.373
I'm sure you'll turn
things around in no time.

29:38.397 --> 29:40.141
Yeah, I hope so, I mean,
to tell you the truth,

29:40.165 --> 29:41.443
after the whole
fireworks fiasco,

29:41.467 --> 29:42.844
I never thought I'd set foot

29:42.868 --> 29:45.402
- in this house again.
- Yeah, Charlie,

29:45.437 --> 29:47.348
- I kinda wanted...
- Listen, sweetheart,

29:47.372 --> 29:50.274
I... i swear, I just want you
and the doll to get it on.

29:50.309 --> 29:52.810
- I'm not gonna do nothin'.
- Wow.

29:52.845 --> 29:55.446
Great party, Charlie.
I checked the whole house.

29:55.481 --> 29:57.181
It sucks everywhere.

29:57.216 --> 29:59.150
- Hey, look, wait, wait, wait.
- No.

30:00.619 --> 30:02.130
I... i don't know
what's wrong with me.

30:02.154 --> 30:05.222
- I...
- [Gasps]

30:05.257 --> 30:08.092
- Yep.
- Stupid asshole!

30:09.628 --> 30:11.628
- Bye, Becca.
- I better go, too.

30:11.663 --> 30:13.108
I have class early
in the morning.

30:13.132 --> 30:14.275
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

30:14.299 --> 30:15.332
Bye, Billy.

30:15.367 --> 30:17.134
- Oh, chuckles.
- Yes, sir.

30:17.169 --> 30:18.368
I think I'm in love.

30:18.403 --> 30:20.170
Oh, me, too.

30:20.205 --> 30:23.607
You guys want some dip?

[Aj] Jesus christ.

30:24.843 --> 30:26.521
What the fuck took you so long?

30:26.545 --> 30:29.213
The fucking Alpha Party
was a total bust.

30:29.248 --> 30:32.382
There were zero rushies,
no girls.

30:32.417 --> 30:33.717
They're fucking assholes.

30:33.752 --> 30:35.719
No girls?

30:35.754 --> 30:37.521
Oh, well,

30:37.556 --> 30:38.700
I think I have some sweethearts

30:38.724 --> 30:40.424
I can send them.

30:40.459 --> 30:41.759
Yeah.

30:43.695 --> 30:45.540
[Billy] Ugh, this party
officially sucks ass.

30:45.564 --> 30:47.175
Dude, don't worry.
There's still time.

30:47.199 --> 30:49.366

- Mm. Boom!

30:49.401 --> 30:51.235
- See, fellas?
- [Door opens]

30:51.270 --> 30:54.238
Sometimes all you gotta have
is just a little bit of...

30:54.273 --> 30:57.174
- Faith.
- Hi, sugar.

30:57.209 --> 30:59.254
- Lookin' for Charlie Martin.
- I'm Charlie Martin.

30:59.278 --> 31:00.577
Oh, well, then,

31:00.612 --> 31:02.390
tonight's your lucky night, son.

31:02.414 --> 31:04.848
I'm Pearl, as in...

31:04.883 --> 31:06.383
The necklace.

31:06.418 --> 31:09.253
We've been gifted to you

31:09.288 --> 31:11.166

by an anonymous donor.

31:16.728 --> 31:18.428
No.

31:18.463 --> 31:19.763
Listen to me.

31:19.798 --> 31:21.543
I don't care how drunk
I get tonight,

31:21.567 --> 31:24.835
do not let me fuck
one of the golden girls.

31:24.870 --> 31:26.737
- I'm serious.
- Uh-huh.

31:26.772 --> 31:28.283
- [Microphone feedback]
- Hello.

31:28.307 --> 31:29.617
[Aj] Hey, Alpha fucks.

31:29.641 --> 31:33.810
Ladies, if you'll just
excuse me.

31:33.845 --> 31:36.580
That's a compliment.

31:36.615 --> 31:37.759
[Becca] Hey, assholes!

31:37.783 --> 31:39.294
What, you're not gonna thank me

31:39.318 --> 31:40.595
for the sweethearts, Charlie?

31:40.619 --> 31:41.919
You know your grandma

31:41.954 --> 31:44.721
gives a surprisingly mean
blowjob.

31:44.756 --> 31:46.267
I guess you learned
from the best.

31:46.291 --> 31:47.802
Enjoy your fucking
bingo night, dickhead.

31:47.826 --> 31:50.561
[All laugh]

31:50.596 --> 31:52.362
This fucking sucks dick.

31:52.397 --> 31:54.865
This is like douchenozzle
at a fucking bachelor auction.

31:54.900 --> 31:56.733
- Zero bids.
- Hey, man,

31:56.768 --> 31:58.735
- it can get better.
- [Sighs]

31:58.770 --> 32:01.538
- It'll get better.
- That's good.

32:01.573 --> 32:04.675
- It's good now.
- Mm-hmm.

32:04.710 --> 32:06.577

32:09.881 --> 32:12.716
[Gasps] Oh, shit.

32:12.751 --> 32:14.918
Hi. Can I fucking
help you, nerd?

32:14.953 --> 32:16.253
That's okay, Billy.

32:16.288 --> 32:17.699
Jonesy, what're you doing here?

32:17.723 --> 32:20.457
Hi Charlie,
heard about your party

32:20.492 --> 32:22.626
and I thought I'd come by
and check it out.

32:22.661 --> 32:24.806
- Maybe rush for you guys.
- You're fucking serious?

32:24.830 --> 32:25.974
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:25.998 --> 32:27.342
I know... i know we're desperate

32:27.366 --> 32:28.743
right now, but look at him.

32:28.767 --> 32:30.712
He's a fucking tri-hard
with his fucking bowtie.

32:30.736 --> 32:33.281
- Okay, all right, Billy, take it easy.
- Your glasses, fuck you.

32:33.305 --> 32:35.606
Billy, just take it easy, okay?

32:35.641 --> 32:37.852
You're more than welcome to
hang out here, Jonesy, really.

32:37.876 --> 32:39.276
Thanks, Charlie.

32:39.311 --> 32:40.622
I would've been here earlier,

32:40.646 --> 32:41.923
but my research session
ran long.

32:41.947 --> 32:43.914
- "Ran long."
- That being said,

32:43.949 --> 32:45.960
and I hope you don't mind,
but I brought a few friends.

32:45.984 --> 32:47.562
Oh, you brought us some friends.

32:47.586 --> 32:48.997
That's just...
That's fucking great.

hot flashes and now you

32:54.960 --> 32:56.804
brought your fucking
nerd friends.

32:56.828 --> 32:58.762
That's just fucking great,
Jonesy!

32:58.797 --> 33:00.908
- Just chill the fuck out.
- I will not chill the fuck out!

33:00.932 --> 33:03.267
We do not

33:03.302 --> 33:05.969

Frank Van dyke iv.

38:19.050 --> 38:21.284
Mr. Van dyke
is an aspiring film director.

38:21.319 --> 38:23.587
He is the mad genius
behind the wildly popular

38:23.622 --> 38:25.322
rolling blackout videos.

38:25.357 --> 38:27.791
His skill set would be
invaluable to us.

38:27.826 --> 38:30.671
[Billy] You know, we're big
fans of your work V.D.,

38:30.695 --> 38:31.861
which is why we want you

38:31.896 --> 38:33.274
to be our personal videographer.

38:33.298 --> 38:34.831
Oh, thanks.

38:34.866 --> 38:36.844
And why the hell
would I want to do that?

38:36.868 --> 38:38.034
Well, besides being awarded

38:38.069 --> 38:39.936
with a lifetime of brotherhood,

38:39.971 --> 38:41.315
you would have firsthand access

38:41.339 --> 38:43.340
to some of the finest drug users

38:43.375 --> 38:45.709
- and degenerates known to man.
- That's right.

38:45.744 --> 38:47.088
You'd have a first row seat

38:47.112 --> 38:49.212

on earth, dude.

38:49.247 --> 38:51.092

- Mm-hmm.

38:51.116 --> 38:52.983

38:53.018 --> 38:55.819
- [Both] Hi.
- [Giggling]

38:55.854 --> 38:58.188
Ah, you don't need
this piece of shit anymore.

38:58.223 --> 38:59.834
[Both] This is for you.

38:59.858 --> 39:02.058
- [Laughing]
- Oh, shit, are you serious?

39:02.093 --> 39:03.738
As my daddy's triple bypass.

39:03.762 --> 39:07.397
Now, Ashley, Brooke,
this is Van dyke.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.377
Van dyke is that director
I was telling you about.

39:09.401 --> 39:10.911
I was telling 'em about
your various

39:10.935 --> 39:13.236
accomplishments as a director.

39:13.271 --> 39:15.639
And they're actresses
who've been working on a scene

39:15.674 --> 39:17.184
and they were wondering
if you might be able

39:17.208 --> 39:18.742
to help them out.

39:18.777 --> 39:20.855
- Hmm. -We're normally
stage actresses,

39:20.879 --> 39:23.346
but we really, really
wanna get into film.

39:23.381 --> 39:26.716
What's the scene from?

39:26.751 --> 39:28.918
- "Fifty shades of gay."
- I may have, uh...

39:28.953 --> 39:31.221
May have a few pointers
for them.

39:31.256 --> 39:33.256
All right, ladies, just, uh...

39:33.291 --> 39:35.036
Way to go, dude.
It's a closed set.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.737
Open up a little bit to camera.

39:36.761 --> 39:38.139
[Laughs] Yeah.

39:38.163 --> 39:41.364
We wanna see
what's going on there.

39:41.399 --> 39:43.000
Well done.

39:45.170 --> 39:47.081
[Billy] You're not gonna
miss being an R.A.

39:47.105 --> 39:50.025
[Charlie] No, but I will miss
confiscating their weed.

to be gynecologists.

40:05.223 --> 40:06.901

40:26.311 --> 40:28.745
Actually. Sorry, Ashley.

40:28.780 --> 40:30.424
- [Laughs]
- It's not funny, man.

40:30.448 --> 40:32.916
I discovered a way to tap
into the female skene's gland,

40:32.951 --> 40:34.295
also known as The G-Spot,

40:34.319 --> 40:35.719
proving once and for all

40:35.754 --> 40:38.088
that women do,
in fact, ejaculate.

40:38.123 --> 40:39.500
But why would any girl
want to squirt?

40:39.524 --> 40:40.890
Because women shouldn't be

40:40.925 --> 40:43.426
the only ones forced to swallow.

40:58.143 --> 40:59.976
Hey.

41:00.011 --> 41:02.378

- I have no idea.

41:02.413 --> 41:05.115
Yes! This rules!

- I am so down, bros.
- [Charlie] Easy, Jonesy.

41:09.053 --> 41:11.988
Look, we see great potential
in you.

41:12.023 --> 41:14.858
But with great power
comes great responsibility.

41:14.893 --> 41:18.261

it would be beneficial

41:28.339 --> 41:30.507
if you continued
your research with us.

41:30.542 --> 41:31.908
That way you can share

41:33.244 --> 41:34.922
with all our new pledges

- Of course not.

42:30.001 --> 42:31.478
Why would anybody know that?

42:31.502 --> 42:33.870

belongs, sarge.

42:33.905 --> 42:35.905

47:22.860 --> 47:25.695
Ah, well, that's not
an easy look to cultivate,

47:25.730 --> 47:27.241
so glad I'm pulling it off.

47:27.265 --> 47:29.565
Oh, glad could be of services.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.578
You're taking
ballston Shakespeare class?

47:31.602 --> 47:33.747
- Yeah, you heard of it?
- I took it last semester.

47:33.771 --> 47:34.771
Really?

47:36.207 --> 47:37.718
Don't look so surprised,
littleton.

47:37.742 --> 47:39.408
Okay, I like the bard.

47:39.443 --> 47:40.654
Your brothers must've given you

47:40.678 --> 47:41.844
a lot of shit for that.

47:41.879 --> 47:43.524
Yeah, they did,
but like Billy says,

47:43.548 --> 47:45.681
"to thine own self be true."

47:45.716 --> 47:47.283
Mm-hmm.

47:47.318 --> 47:49.152
Do you wanna sit?

47:49.187 --> 47:51.787
Oh, are you sure you want
to fraternize with the enemy?

47:51.822 --> 47:54.557
- I won't tell if you won't.
- You know, I don't get

47:54.592 --> 47:57.360
this whole war between
the kappa's and the Alpha's.

47:57.395 --> 47:58.805
Why do you guys
hate each other so much?

47:58.829 --> 48:00.296
Ancient grudge.

48:00.331 --> 48:01.775
Nobody even remembers why
it started.

48:01.799 --> 48:04.500
Like the capulets
and the montagues.

48:04.535 --> 48:06.536
- Ah.
- See what I did there?

48:06.571 --> 48:08.871
Yes. So, it's a line
that can't be crossed.

48:08.906 --> 48:10.717
Yeah.
Romeo and juliet crossed it.

48:10.741 --> 48:12.452
Their love gave them courage.

48:12.476 --> 48:14.344
Well, they ended up dead.

48:15.580 --> 48:16.813
Maybe not us.

48:20.751 --> 48:22.585
I heard about the car wash.

48:22.620 --> 48:23.931
I'm sorry about your pledges.

48:23.955 --> 48:25.666
Yeah, well, who woulda thought

48:25.690 --> 48:28.191
that a bunch of young guys
could be so easily swayed

48:28.226 --> 48:30.860
by some beautiful
dripping wet women in bikinis?

48:30.895 --> 48:32.873
- Well, you still have time.
- Not enough.

48:32.897 --> 48:34.630
We would need, like,

48:34.665 --> 48:36.577
a bunch of guys
at one time to join.

48:36.601 --> 48:39.435
Gentlemen! What is up, boys?

48:39.470 --> 48:41.615
Dude, let's rock and roll!
Let's make heads roll!

48:41.639 --> 48:44.240
Let's do this, boys! Let's go!

48:44.275 --> 48:47.710
- You mean like a team?
- Like a team, yes, good idea.

48:47.745 --> 48:50.513
But, lacrosse guys
don't join fraternities.

48:50.548 --> 48:52.315
Why not?

48:52.350 --> 48:54.317
It's a line
that can't be crossed.

48:54.352 --> 48:57.353
Well, Romeo and juliet
crossed it.

48:57.388 --> 48:59.522
All you need is a little bit
of courage.

49:04.862 --> 49:06.673
- [Mix background chatter]
- [Whistle blows]

49:06.697 --> 49:09.265
Here we go, guys, let's go.
Let's fucking go, boy.

49:09.300 --> 49:11.234
Fuck you. Let's do it!

49:19.310 --> 49:20.710
[Phone ringing]

49:22.780 --> 49:24.358
Douchenozzle,
there has to be one alum

49:24.382 --> 49:25.348
who played lacrosse.

49:25.383 --> 49:27.617
Find him. Do it.

49:27.652 --> 49:29.496
You can do way better than this.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.488
- Shut the fuck up, wimp. -Come on, Zack.
Help me do it.

49:34.825 --> 49:36.859
Ow! There they are!

49:36.894 --> 49:38.805
There they are!
Great game out there, Zack!

49:38.829 --> 49:41.897
Great game. You slaughtered
them out there.

49:41.932 --> 49:43.543
This was a fucking practice,
dickface.

49:43.567 --> 49:45.868
Yeah, what can I say,
you guys were fantastic.

49:45.903 --> 49:47.403
Who the fuck are you?

49:47.438 --> 49:49.472
Yeah, who the fuck are you,
Nancy drew?

49:49.507 --> 49:51.941
My name is Charlie Martin.
I'm from axg.

49:51.976 --> 49:54.821
And we think you boys have what
it takes to become members.

49:54.845 --> 49:57.591
- Lacrosse players don't join frats.
- I don't know, Zack.

49:57.615 --> 49:59.660
I think you guys
are already a fraternity.

49:59.684 --> 50:01.295
You just haven't
realized it yet.

50:01.319 --> 50:02.629
I mean, you eat together.

50:02.653 --> 50:04.431
You study together.
You party together.

50:04.455 --> 50:06.433
Hell, you're probably banging
the same checks, too.

50:06.457 --> 50:09.025
- Hmm?
- Yeah, man.

50:09.060 --> 50:10.760
A'right, a'right.

50:10.795 --> 50:12.606
You guys are a family
just like us.

50:12.630 --> 50:13.940
Well, if we already do
all that shit,

50:13.964 --> 50:15.676
why the fuck do we need to join?

50:15.700 --> 50:17.744
That is a very good question,
and one I will answer.

50:17.768 --> 50:18.979
Excuse me, boys. Excuse me.

50:19.003 --> 50:20.447
Holy shit. You're Sam venable.

50:20.471 --> 50:21.904
I sure as shit am, son.

50:21.939 --> 50:24.440
Ncaa division one,
lacrosse all-star,

50:24.475 --> 50:26.019
five time
world lacrosse champion

50:26.043 --> 50:27.587
with the rings to prove it.

50:27.611 --> 50:29.389
You guys get rings for that,
don't you?

50:29.413 --> 50:31.591
- We sure as shit do, son.
- And most importantly he was...

50:31.615 --> 50:34.617
Former Alpha vice president
and alumni chairman.

50:34.652 --> 50:36.986
You're my fucking hero.
Can I have an autograph?

50:37.021 --> 50:39.689
I'll give you an autograph
when you sign a bid card.

50:39.724 --> 50:42.558
- [Man] All right, we'll come.
- Okay, we will,

50:42.593 --> 50:44.037
but we're not
making any promises.

50:44.061 --> 50:46.662
- It's cool, man.
- Let's go, boys.

50:46.697 --> 50:50.099
- All right, right on!
- It's Sam fuckin' venable.

50:50.134 --> 50:53.436
Sam, I really appreciate
your help on this one.

50:53.471 --> 50:55.782
No problem. Anything for the
son of old torchy, huh?

50:55.806 --> 50:57.286
- Ugh!
- Whew!

50:59.910 --> 51:01.722
- [Charlie] Almost there.
- [Katie] All right.

51:01.746 --> 51:03.479
[Charlie] Almost there.

51:03.514 --> 51:05.381
All right.

51:05.416 --> 51:07.094
[Katie] Ugh. You're gonna
murder me, aren't you?

51:07.118 --> 51:09.585
Uh, you ruined
your surprise, way to go.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.620
- Okay.
- Yeah?

51:11.655 --> 51:13.122
Oh!

51:13.157 --> 51:14.724
A picnic?

51:14.759 --> 51:17.460
- What, and rose petals?
- Yeah.

51:17.495 --> 51:19.695
- Wow. How romantic of you.
- Well,

51:19.730 --> 51:22.398
I saw it on "the bachelor."

51:22.433 --> 51:25.000
Wow, I'm just surprised
the wine didn't come in a box.

51:25.035 --> 51:27.002
Well, littleton, I'm all class.

51:27.037 --> 51:30.439
- What can I say?
- I'm very impressed.

51:30.474 --> 51:32.742
This is to say thank you
for the wonderful idea

51:32.777 --> 51:35.411
- about the lacrosse team.
- Wait, so did they commit?

51:35.446 --> 51:37.880
Not yet, but we're having
a party tomorrow night

51:37.915 --> 51:40.549
so, I'm kinda hoping
that seals the deal.

51:40.584 --> 51:42.485
- Party?
- Uh-huh.

51:42.520 --> 51:45.465
- Why, thank you for the invite.
- Well, you're not invited.

51:45.489 --> 51:47.590
- Thank you.
- Obviously,

51:47.625 --> 51:49.625
I would love it
if you could come.

51:49.660 --> 51:51.505
Okay, thank you. I'll be there.

51:51.529 --> 51:54.731
I graciously accept
your last minute invitation.

51:57.435 --> 52:00.903
Mm, so what made you
want to become an Alpha?

52:00.938 --> 52:04.507
My father was
an Alpha, actually.

52:04.542 --> 52:06.787
He used to always talk about
the amazing times he had here

52:06.811 --> 52:08.711
and wanted nothing more for me

52:08.746 --> 52:10.056
than just to follow
in his footsteps.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.180
He must be really proud

52:11.215 --> 52:12.559
of what you're doing right now.

52:12.583 --> 52:13.983
Yeah, he would be.

52:14.018 --> 52:16.619
- He died when I was young.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

52:16.654 --> 52:18.154
Hmm, it's okay.

52:18.189 --> 52:21.690
Actually, he was gonna run
for governor,

52:21.725 --> 52:24.193
and Billy's dad was gonna be
his campaign manager.

52:24.228 --> 52:25.772
- Really.
- Yeah, but when dad died,

52:25.796 --> 52:28.864
Governor Taylor now,
picked up the torch

52:28.899 --> 52:31.901
and, um...

52:31.936 --> 52:33.780
You know, he's always been
a second father to me.

52:33.804 --> 52:35.048
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:35.072 --> 52:36.739
And Billy, my brother,

52:36.774 --> 52:39.875
my crazy brother.

52:39.910 --> 52:42.178
So, I guess being a leader
is just in your DNA.

52:42.213 --> 52:45.514
- Well, I guess so.
- Hmm, so, uh,

52:45.549 --> 52:48.017
are you planning on following
in your fathers footsteps,

52:48.052 --> 52:49.552
future governor?

52:49.587 --> 52:51.554
Nothing would make me happier.

52:51.589 --> 52:53.109
- Nothing?
- Mm.

53:10.207 --> 53:12.107
Nice "beerymid."

53:12.142 --> 53:13.643
Mm-hmm.

53:21.051 --> 53:23.886
- [Katie moaning] Oh, yeah.
- Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh.

53:23.921 --> 53:25.688
- You hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

53:25.723 --> 53:28.023
Sounds like chuckles
is puttin' the ole tube steak

53:28.058 --> 53:31.727
- into the oven.
- Ah, I love steak!

53:31.762 --> 53:33.896
I gotta go. [Clears throat]

53:33.931 --> 53:35.675
- [Beer cans clanging]
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

53:35.699 --> 53:37.143
That took me, like, 20 minutes.

53:37.167 --> 53:38.868
Hey!

53:38.903 --> 53:40.747
Don't you fuckin'
jerk off in my room again.

53:40.771 --> 53:42.182
I catch you jerking off
in my room again,

53:42.206 --> 53:44.240
- I'll whoop your ass.
- It's too late.

53:44.275 --> 53:47.195
- Douche!
- I'm only gonna jerk off to the katie parts.

53:49.146 --> 53:51.992
[Katie] Do you get the feeling
that we were being watched?

53:52.016 --> 53:53.849
[Charlie] Watched? No.

53:53.884 --> 53:55.618
Listen to? Definitely.

53:55.653 --> 53:57.130
Ah. [Giggles]

53:57.154 --> 53:59.589
[Both chattering]

54:01.859 --> 54:04.093
- Well, I had fun today.
- Yes, I noticed.

54:04.128 --> 54:05.861
[Both laugh]

54:05.896 --> 54:07.874
- Thank you for walking me home.
- Of course.

54:07.898 --> 54:09.565
So, party tomorrow night?

54:09.600 --> 54:12.168
- I will be there.
- Okay. See you.

54:15.105 --> 54:16.939
- See you.
- To be continued.

54:16.974 --> 54:18.207
Yes.

54:26.283 --> 54:29.018
That fucking bitch.

54:30.688 --> 54:33.088
Well, looks like
we got a traitor in our midst.

54:33.123 --> 54:34.891
What? Where?

54:36.594 --> 54:38.861
You gonna take care of that?

54:38.896 --> 54:40.696
It'll be my pleasure.

54:43.133 --> 54:44.893
I didn't tell you to stop.

54:50.808 --> 54:52.041
Teeth.

55:04.154 --> 55:05.888
Katie.

55:05.923 --> 55:07.156
Katie!

55:09.326 --> 55:11.827
- Katie!
- What?

55:11.862 --> 55:13.206
Why weren't you at the car wash

55:13.230 --> 55:14.296
yesterday, Katie?

55:14.331 --> 55:16.298
Because I was in class, Becca.

55:16.333 --> 55:17.833
That car wash was official

55:17.868 --> 55:20.869
- Sigma Business, bitch.
- I was in class.

55:20.904 --> 55:23.105
You think this is all
some big joke, don't you?

55:23.140 --> 55:25.218
I didn't join just so I could
wash cars with my tits.

55:25.242 --> 55:27.354
And all you seem to care about
these days is looking for ways

55:27.378 --> 55:29.889
- to fuck over Charlie.
- And all you seem to care about

55:29.913 --> 55:31.758
is trying to find ways
to fuck him.

55:31.782 --> 55:34.083
Ugh! Why are you
like this, Becca?

55:34.118 --> 55:36.586
This is your last warning.

55:40.891 --> 55:42.369
All right, boys,
big night tonight.

55:42.393 --> 55:44.237
We need the lacrosse team
to commit.

55:44.261 --> 55:46.039
Our future pretty much
depends on it.

55:46.063 --> 55:47.841
Douchenozzle,
what's the theme of the party?

55:47.865 --> 55:50.332
"Paintapalooza."
Flesh is your canvas.

55:50.367 --> 55:53.702
I love it. Jonesy.

55:53.737 --> 55:55.382
If you see one of the members
of the lacrosse team

55:55.406 --> 55:57.017
that looks the least bit bored,

55:57.041 --> 55:58.818
you put a beer in his hand
and a hot slam-piece

55:58.842 --> 56:00.353
on his arm
and we show these guys

56:00.377 --> 56:02.745
the best fucking party
of their lives, okay? Yeah.

56:02.780 --> 56:04.758
- Get some! Get some!
- Sarge, sarge, sarge!

56:04.782 --> 56:08.083
Sarge, it's a paint party,
not a paint gun party.

56:08.118 --> 56:09.952
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah.

56:09.987 --> 56:12.421
Listen, okay,
I need you to keep a lookout

56:12.456 --> 56:13.900
for the kappy nu goons tonight.

56:13.924 --> 56:15.335
If any of those dickheads
get within

56:15.359 --> 56:17.337
50 feet of the perimeter,
you eliminate them.

56:17.361 --> 56:19.695
Can you handle that, soldier?

56:19.730 --> 56:21.141
With extreme prejudice, sir.

56:21.165 --> 56:23.666
- Good, go on.
- You're all warriors.

56:23.701 --> 56:25.401
Gonna get some! Hoorah!

56:27.071 --> 56:28.270
Van dyke, I need you

56:28.305 --> 56:30.016
to setup cameras
all around the house.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.052
I want to catch people
doing some crazy shit tonight.

56:32.076 --> 56:33.842
Can you handle that?

56:33.877 --> 56:35.455
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

56:35.479 --> 56:36.979
Guys, all eyes on Billy.

56:37.014 --> 56:39.281
[All chanting] Billy!

56:41.151 --> 56:42.818
[Music playing]

56:44.421 --> 56:46.388
[All chattering]

56:46.423 --> 56:48.134
Let's light the fires,
let's keep it tight,

56:48.158 --> 56:49.436
and remember lacrosse team.

56:49.460 --> 56:51.237
Bring 'em in. Come on in, guys.

56:51.261 --> 56:53.462
[Cheering]

56:53.497 --> 56:55.464
Let's go, boys!

56:55.499 --> 56:58.100
[Music playing]

57:03.373 --> 57:05.174
Hey! What'd all say

57:05.209 --> 57:09.044
we get this
fucking party started!

Hey ladies.
It's a killer party, huh?

57:39.443 --> 57:43.879
You know I would love
to show you around the house.

57:43.914 --> 57:46.181

57:46.216 --> 57:49.852
Ouch. Sorry, man.

57:49.887 --> 57:52.121
- That was brutal.
- Yeah.

You saw that, did you?
That's great.

57:55.159 --> 57:57.826
Hey, I know how you feel.

All I ever used to do
was strike out.

Excuse me.

Jonesy, I have been
in a vaginal rut

58:09.840 --> 58:11.206
for three god damn years,

58:11.241 --> 58:13.119
and I thought
that banging old whore Pearl

58:13.143 --> 58:14.554
might've given me
a little boost, right?

58:14.578 --> 58:17.312
But all it gave me
was chlamydia.

58:17.347 --> 58:20.516
Look, I know it sucks,
but trust me,

58:20.551 --> 58:22.217

Yeah, that's easy
for you to say, rainmaker,

01:08:56.752 --> 01:08:58.764
- Stay with me, Charlie.
- You have really nice boobs.

01:08:58.787 --> 01:09:00.955
- Stay with me.
- They're nice.

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:02.023
Hey.

01:09:03.827 --> 01:09:05.794
Hey, Charlie.

01:09:05.828 --> 01:09:08.496
Charlie, what the fuck, man.

01:09:08.531 --> 01:09:10.098
Charlie.

01:09:10.133 --> 01:09:12.100
Charlie, where're you going?

01:09:12.135 --> 01:09:13.868
What the fuck, man?

01:09:16.973 --> 01:09:18.651
[Charlie] Will you get
me some more beer?

01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:20.742
I think you've had enough.
There we go.

01:09:20.777 --> 01:09:22.520
What the fuck took you so long?

01:09:22.545 --> 01:09:24.223
Are you kidding me?
You're getting paid the same.

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:26.926
- Okay? Relax.
- Why's everything so blurry, man?

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:28.990
I mean, I feel like
I need some glasses.

01:09:29.018 --> 01:09:30.585
Am I gonna be like Jonesy?

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.163
- I'm gonna be like Jonesy.
- Relax, Charlie.

01:09:32.188 --> 01:09:33.999
I just gave you
a little something to chill

01:09:34.023 --> 01:09:36.624
you out, you're gonna love this.

01:09:36.658 --> 01:09:37.803
Hey, who's your two friends?

01:09:37.827 --> 01:09:39.037
You are paying me
in cash, right?

01:09:39.062 --> 01:09:41.696
- Yes, of course.
- Oh! Oh!

01:09:41.731 --> 01:09:43.776
- All right, let's get nice and comfy.
- My penis is out.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.234
That's what we want.
Okay, there we go.

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:49.537
- There we go.
- Hey, whoa. Hey, wow.

01:09:49.572 --> 01:09:51.216
- Nice boobs, babe.
- Mm-hmm, they're gorgeous.

01:09:51.241 --> 01:09:53.774
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait a second.

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:56.878
- Wait a second. I like katie's boobs.
- No, you don't.

01:09:56.913 --> 01:10:00.815
- Who the fuck is katie?
- Why don't you fondle them a bit? Yeah.

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:03.751
Drink up, Charlie. Drink up.

01:10:03.786 --> 01:10:05.620
Drink up. There you go.

01:10:05.655 --> 01:10:07.889
Chug it. Keep chugging.

01:10:07.924 --> 01:10:12.527
- Oh, oh, that's my penis.
- Are you seeing this, AJ?

01:10:12.562 --> 01:10:14.206
- Loud and clear.
- Animal!

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:16.998
- Who's your favorite animal?
- Hey, get that money shot.

01:10:17.033 --> 01:10:20.702
Oh, right.
Let's get the money shot.

01:10:20.737 --> 01:10:23.015
- All right. Hey, asshole.
- What're you doing with the paint?

01:10:23.039 --> 01:10:24.216
- You got paint.
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.607
It's showtime.

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:27.152
You know what I wanted to say.

01:10:27.176 --> 01:10:31.179
- Paint party!
- You're gonna love the paint.

01:10:31.214 --> 01:10:33.548
- [Laughing]
- [Music playing]

01:10:38.087 --> 01:10:40.288
Billy!
Great night last night, huh?

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:42.034
Yeah, it was fucking great.

01:10:42.058 --> 01:10:44.726
Ooh, ouch. What's his problem?

01:10:44.761 --> 01:10:46.071
I don't know,
I don't remember a thing

01:10:46.095 --> 01:10:47.529
from last night.

01:10:47.564 --> 01:10:49.308
And I got a serious wangover, man.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.143
Well, that sounds like
you blacked out.

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:52.177
- Yeah?
- Nicely done.

01:10:52.201 --> 01:10:53.245
- Thanks.
- Ready for today?

01:10:53.269 --> 01:10:54.269
You kidding me?

01:10:54.304 --> 01:10:57.805
I'm just getting started.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.675
- How you feel?
- You're making a right, baby.

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:02.844
A living legend.

01:11:02.879 --> 01:11:04.123
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey, baby.

01:11:04.147 --> 01:11:06.014
Hey, there.

01:11:06.049 --> 01:11:08.049
- [Woman] Hi.
- Hey, there.

01:11:08.084 --> 01:11:10.252
[All chattering]

01:11:18.027 --> 01:11:19.961
Here you are, Dean Kravitz.

01:11:19.996 --> 01:11:22.130
Those are the 12 bid cards

01:11:22.165 --> 01:11:24.125
which makes 15 members
as requested.

01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:29.114
Well, you're quite proud
of yourself,

01:11:29.138 --> 01:11:31.272
- aren't you, Charlie?
- Yes sir, I am.

01:11:31.307 --> 01:11:34.776
Good. Well, let me ask you
something.

01:11:34.811 --> 01:11:37.812
- Are you proud of this?
- [Music playing]

01:11:41.618 --> 01:11:42.784
Is that me?

01:11:44.754 --> 01:11:47.088
Holy shit, that's me.

01:11:47.123 --> 01:11:50.058
Holy shit, dude.
That's Tanya tata's video.

01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:51.870
You're banging Tanya tata's.

01:11:51.894 --> 01:11:53.939
That's the hottest porn star
in the game right now.

01:11:53.963 --> 01:11:57.003
- How come I don't remember that?
- You blacked out, remember?

01:11:58.301 --> 01:12:00.602
Being blackout drunk
doesn't exactly

01:12:00.637 --> 01:12:02.314
strengthen your case, asshole.

01:12:02.338 --> 01:12:04.339
Okay, Dean Kravitz, but, I mean,

01:12:04.374 --> 01:12:06.285
this is just a video
of a college kid having sex,

01:12:06.309 --> 01:12:07.653
that's not a big deal, right?

01:12:07.677 --> 01:12:10.979
Oh, it's not a big deal,
Charlie.

01:12:11.014 --> 01:12:15.617
It's a very big deal.

01:12:15.652 --> 01:12:19.654
The Dean is a small dick weasel.

01:12:19.689 --> 01:12:22.123
[Laughing]

01:12:22.158 --> 01:12:23.825
Oh, shit.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.793
Am I a small dick weasel,
Charlie?

01:12:25.828 --> 01:12:27.328
No, sir.

01:12:27.363 --> 01:12:29.675
- Is that what you think of me?
- No, sir.

01:12:29.699 --> 01:12:31.977
I went out on a limb for you,
you stupid little shithead.

01:12:32.001 --> 01:12:34.068
And this is how you repay me?

01:12:34.103 --> 01:12:35.881
Look, Dean,
somebody's obviously trying

01:12:35.905 --> 01:12:37.349
to sabotage us here,
I would never...

01:12:37.373 --> 01:12:40.675
This video was sent to every
single person on campus!

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.044
You know what that means?

01:12:43.079 --> 01:12:44.345
It means from now on

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.791
I'm not gonna be known
as the Dean

01:12:45.815 --> 01:12:47.760
with the many
academic accomplishments

01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:48.950
or civil war reenactments.

01:12:48.985 --> 01:12:50.418
No, I'm gonna be known as

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:54.656
the Dean with the small
weasel size dick!

01:12:54.691 --> 01:12:58.259
- But sir, I'm telling...
- No buts, Charlie!

01:12:58.294 --> 01:13:00.406
One of the conditions
of you getting your house back

01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:02.930
was to always represent
the school

01:13:02.965 --> 01:13:04.666
in a positive light.

01:13:04.701 --> 01:13:06.245
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:06.269 --> 01:13:08.429
Well, this video sure as shit
doesn't do that.

01:13:10.773 --> 01:13:13.875
Request for reinstatement
denied.

01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:14.942
Dean, please.

01:13:14.977 --> 01:13:18.312
Vacate Alpha house now.

01:13:18.347 --> 01:13:20.815
Vacate the house...

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:23.018
Vacate the house now.

01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:29.234
Guys, don't you see
I didn't do it?

01:13:29.258 --> 01:13:30.758
Well, from what I saw,

01:13:30.793 --> 01:13:32.304
you were pretty much balls deep

01:13:32.328 --> 01:13:35.930
inside Tanya tata's
which is seriously awesome.

01:13:35.965 --> 01:13:37.810
Then how come
I don't remember it?

01:13:37.834 --> 01:13:39.411
You blacked out, remember?

01:13:39.435 --> 01:13:41.769
Jesus fucking christ.

01:13:41.804 --> 01:13:43.716
You know, I saw you last night
with Becca, Charlie.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.707
You were gropin' on her titties,

01:13:45.742 --> 01:13:47.252
and then the two of you went off

01:13:47.276 --> 01:13:48.810
into your fucking bedroom

01:13:48.845 --> 01:13:50.823
and she had this
fucking look on her face like,

01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:53.448
"I'm gonna hit his fucking
big ass pretty blonde cock."

01:13:53.483 --> 01:13:55.883
Billy, I would never
do that to you.

01:13:55.918 --> 01:13:57.351
No? 'Cause I got one nut,

01:13:57.386 --> 01:13:58.897
Charlie, I got one fucking nut,

01:13:58.921 --> 01:14:00.121
but I got two eyes,

01:14:00.156 --> 01:14:02.067
and I saw that fucking
hungry ass look

01:14:02.091 --> 01:14:03.235
on her face, she was, like, "oh!"

01:14:03.259 --> 01:14:04.470
I'm gonna get to fucking lick

01:14:04.494 --> 01:14:06.305
Charlie's dangly balls today.

01:14:06.329 --> 01:14:08.796
I'm gonna get his fucking,
sweet beautiful handsome boy

01:14:08.831 --> 01:14:10.109
blonde cock all down my throat.

01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:11.510
That's what's gonna happen.

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:13.245
And then I'm gonna
get this other bitch

01:14:13.269 --> 01:14:15.114
and she's gonna tongue
his nuts while I fuck him.

01:14:15.138 --> 01:14:16.381
That's what's gonna happen.

01:14:16.405 --> 01:14:17.750
Then we're gonna do butt stuff.

01:14:17.774 --> 01:14:19.140
We're gonna do butt stuff,

01:14:19.175 --> 01:14:20.953
"and Billy's gonna be outside
all by himself."

01:14:20.977 --> 01:14:22.521
Smell that.
What's that smell like?

01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:24.523
Nothin' that's
the fucking problem, Charlie.

01:14:24.547 --> 01:14:28.049
Billy, Billy, don't you see?

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:29.484
Becca did this.

01:14:29.519 --> 01:14:32.186
She did this, not me.
You just said it.

01:14:32.221 --> 01:14:34.233
You know what?
You're un-fucking-believable.

01:14:34.257 --> 01:14:36.101
There's no conspiracy here,
Charlie.

01:14:36.125 --> 01:14:37.458
You fucked up.

01:14:37.493 --> 01:14:40.294
You destroyed the alphas twice.

01:14:40.329 --> 01:14:43.164
You remember that.

01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:45.032
Billy.

01:14:45.067 --> 01:14:46.345
- Billy!
- Let's go, noz.

01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:49.771
Sorry, Charlie. Tanya tata's.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.898
[Aj] All right, boys,
we're gonna fuck

01:15:05.922 --> 01:15:07.566
-so much tail in this place.
- Back the fuck away

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:09.268
from the perimeter,
I got zips in the wire.

01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:10.369
- Zips in the wire.
- [Laughs]

01:15:10.393 --> 01:15:11.970
Is this guy fucking serious?

01:15:11.994 --> 01:15:13.939
Hey, why don't you
and your backup dancers

01:15:13.963 --> 01:15:16.008
-keep on walkin'... -Hey, are
you off your fucking meds

01:15:16.032 --> 01:15:17.843
or something,
get the fuck off my porch.

01:15:17.867 --> 01:15:19.878
Medication's for pussies, bitch!
Don't fuck with me.

01:15:19.902 --> 01:15:22.247
- Holy... what do you feed this piece of shit?
- Stand down, sarge.

01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:23.816
- Battle's lost.
- Thanks, Charlie.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.973
Exactly what he said.
Stand the fuck down.

01:15:26.008 --> 01:15:27.820
All right, buddy.
Go get laid maybe.

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:29.110
Fucking loosen up a bit.

01:15:29.145 --> 01:15:30.556
Jesus christ.
Are you kidding me?

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.013
All right, boys.

01:15:32.048 --> 01:15:33.358
I want you to take
these letters down

01:15:33.382 --> 01:15:34.893
and clean up all this shit.

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:36.918
Boys, welcome
to the new Kappa Nu!

01:15:36.953 --> 01:15:38.353
[Cheering]

01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:52.467
[Phone buzzing]

01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:09.284
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

01:16:12.955 --> 01:16:16.090
Aw, yes! Yes!

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:19.961
I got 99 problems
but a blank ain't one.

01:16:19.996 --> 01:16:22.063
Spectacular abs.

01:16:22.098 --> 01:16:24.332
Morgan Freeman's voice.

01:16:24.367 --> 01:16:27.602
Three dicks at the same time.

01:16:27.637 --> 01:16:30.471
Okay, hold on,
you got 99 problems,

01:16:30.506 --> 01:16:32.084
but three dicks at the same time

01:16:32.108 --> 01:16:34.141
ain't one of 'em.

01:16:34.176 --> 01:16:37.144
I don't understand this game.

01:16:37.179 --> 01:16:38.880
This sucks.

01:16:40.549 --> 01:16:42.617
- At least we're all together.
- Hmm, yeah.

01:16:42.652 --> 01:16:44.118
Yeah, we're all together.

01:16:44.153 --> 01:16:45.993
In the fuckin' student lounge!

01:16:46.022 --> 01:16:48.489
With the fuckin'
loners and stoners,

01:16:48.524 --> 01:16:50.992
and the fuckin' asians!

01:16:51.027 --> 01:16:52.560
And the god damn

01:16:52.595 --> 01:16:55.496
- "Lord of the Rings" fuckin' nerds!
- Yes!

01:16:55.531 --> 01:16:57.376
Actually, they're playing
"game of thrones."

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.600
Yeah, what a bunch
of fuckin' boners, man.

01:16:59.635 --> 01:17:01.969
- More like throners.
- I swear to god, Jonesy,

01:17:02.004 --> 01:17:04.205
I will fuckin' murder you.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.141
Shut your faceholes,
you god damn crybabies.

01:17:07.176 --> 01:17:09.644
We may have lost our house,

01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:13.180
that does not mean
we have to lose our hope.

01:17:13.215 --> 01:17:15.082
Because a fraternity

01:17:15.117 --> 01:17:18.085
is not the only way that men
on this campus can connect.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.088
Are you saying,
we should go gay?

01:17:21.123 --> 01:17:23.491
No, douche, you fucking idiot.

01:17:23.526 --> 01:17:25.537
I'm saying we should join
the Mason-Dixon reserve

01:17:25.561 --> 01:17:26.661
officer training corp.

01:17:26.696 --> 01:17:29.597
Boys, meet captain griffin.

01:17:29.632 --> 01:17:31.299
Atten-hut.

01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:35.570
[Passing gas]

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.140
Sarge,

01:17:39.175 --> 01:17:42.977
the rotc prides itself

01:17:43.012 --> 01:17:46.580
in taking fat, lazy,
gutless deadbeats,

01:17:46.615 --> 01:17:48.549
and turns 'em into men!

01:17:51.253 --> 01:17:53.721
This is the sorriest case
of sad sacks

01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:55.589
that I have ever seen!

01:17:55.624 --> 01:17:59.126
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

01:17:59.161 --> 01:18:01.062
But these fucktards,

01:18:01.097 --> 01:18:02.497
they're hopeless.

01:18:04.633 --> 01:18:06.267
Good luck, sarge.

01:18:10.272 --> 01:18:11.672
Sweet Jesus.

01:18:11.707 --> 01:18:14.175
We can't even get
into fuckin' rotc.

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:18.112
What was that about?

01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:21.983
Guys.

01:18:24.286 --> 01:18:27.621
I'm sorry, Charlie, but we
don't talk to traitors here.

01:18:27.656 --> 01:18:30.091
Or people who betray us.

01:18:30.126 --> 01:18:34.695
- Wow. You too, douche.
- It's Mr. nozzle to you.

01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.430
Listen to me, Charlie.

01:18:36.465 --> 01:18:39.266
You lost our house
for the second time,

01:18:39.301 --> 01:18:43.270
of course, I'm gonna be
a little upset about it.

01:18:43.305 --> 01:18:45.439
That house was my life, okay?

01:18:45.474 --> 01:18:47.319
That... that was all
of our lives.

01:18:47.343 --> 01:18:48.587
I mean, just look
at poor douche,

01:18:48.611 --> 01:18:50.077
look at him now.

01:18:50.112 --> 01:18:51.556
- He looks exactly the same.
- Yeah,

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.581
because we're that
fucking pathetic.

01:18:53.616 --> 01:18:55.761
- Doesn't get much worse than that.
- Thank you, Billy.

01:18:55.785 --> 01:18:57.752
Look, Billy, I'm sorry, okay,

01:18:57.787 --> 01:18:59.664
but I just came
from Van dyke's house

01:18:59.688 --> 01:19:03.057
- and I got a way to get the house back.
- No, you're not

01:19:03.092 --> 01:19:05.559
gonna be able to fool me
with that bullshit again.

01:19:05.594 --> 01:19:08.707
Billy, I know you're pissed and
you... god damn it, you should be,

01:19:08.731 --> 01:19:10.642
- but just give me one more chance.
- No, no, no, no!

01:19:10.666 --> 01:19:12.077
You don't get another chance.

01:19:12.101 --> 01:19:13.478
All right, you had
a second chance

01:19:13.502 --> 01:19:16.470
- and you blew it, you understand?
- Yeah.

01:19:16.505 --> 01:19:18.472
Hey, I made some
mistakes, Billy.

01:19:18.507 --> 01:19:20.419
And we've all made
some mistakes, even you.

01:19:20.443 --> 01:19:21.586
But god damn it, we're brothers

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:24.645
and brothers forgive.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.581
Now, I never told you this,
but it was my dad's dream

01:19:27.616 --> 01:19:29.784
that I would become
more than his son some day.

01:19:29.819 --> 01:19:31.786
I would become his brother.

01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:33.698
And I know he's not here,
but god damn it,

01:19:33.722 --> 01:19:35.767
I know he would be proud
to see his brothers forgive

01:19:35.791 --> 01:19:38.092
and unite.

01:19:38.127 --> 01:19:40.261
Billy, I'm begging you.

01:19:46.402 --> 01:19:50.571
Wow, that was quite
a speech there, Dr. king.

01:19:50.606 --> 01:19:52.284
I mean, you know what,
the dream is dead.

01:19:52.308 --> 01:19:55.543
So, why don't you
just hit the bricks?

01:19:55.578 --> 01:19:57.498
You know,
get the fuck out of here.

01:20:06.255 --> 01:20:08.175
No, you stay right there,
Charlie.

01:20:11.427 --> 01:20:13.494
I say we give Charlie
another chance.

01:20:13.529 --> 01:20:16.097
Nope, nope, absolutely...
Yep, yeah.

01:20:16.132 --> 01:20:18.766
[Clears throat] Me, too.

01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:20.468
I concur.

01:20:20.503 --> 01:20:21.713
I don't know
what that word means,

01:20:21.737 --> 01:20:24.338
but I'm with sarge and Zack.

01:20:26.742 --> 01:20:28.209
Billy.

01:20:29.879 --> 01:20:32.447
I am truly, truly sorry.

01:20:33.816 --> 01:20:35.616
But god damn it, I need you.

01:20:45.594 --> 01:20:47.795
You're a son of a bitch,
Charlie Martin.

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:50.264
- I agree.
- All right.

01:20:50.299 --> 01:20:52.166
All right, all right.

01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:55.202
So, you got a way
to get our house back.

01:20:55.237 --> 01:20:56.877
I got a way. Boys...

01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.674
Check this out.

01:21:01.677 --> 01:21:04.411
What the... holy shit.

01:21:04.446 --> 01:21:07.148
- Sick.
- Holy sheep shit.

01:21:12.788 --> 01:21:14.348
[Charlie] Katie!

01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:19.160
By now I'm sure
you've seen the sex tape.

01:21:20.596 --> 01:21:21.907
But it wasn't me,
I swear to god,

01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:24.431
it was not me.

01:21:24.466 --> 01:21:26.178
I mean, technically, it was me,

01:21:26.202 --> 01:21:28.469
but I was setup.

01:21:28.504 --> 01:21:31.705
Look, I got one last chance
to make this thing right,

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.208
and when it's all said and done,

01:21:34.243 --> 01:21:36.210
I hope that includes you, too.

01:21:39.448 --> 01:21:42.616
I gotta go, uh...

01:21:42.651 --> 01:21:45.653
To be continued, I hope.

01:22:24.393 --> 01:22:26.961
How many condoms does she need?

01:22:31.867 --> 01:22:33.634
Un-fucking-believable.

01:22:42.378 --> 01:22:44.511
[People clapping]

01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:47.581
Hey, hey, hey,
you hold it right there,

01:22:47.616 --> 01:22:48.816
Bob the fuckin' builder.

01:22:48.851 --> 01:22:50.818
Oh, look everyone.
It's the geeds.

01:22:50.853 --> 01:22:52.664
Shouldn't you guys
be on a park bench somewhere

01:22:52.688 --> 01:22:54.532
- jerking each other off?
- You know what, AJ?

01:22:54.556 --> 01:22:56.468
You might've think that
you've won, but reality,

01:22:56.492 --> 01:22:57.869
you're a load that your mother

01:22:57.893 --> 01:22:59.638
shoulda swallowed,
and believe me when I say

01:22:59.662 --> 01:23:01.528
she can fuckin' swallow.

01:23:01.563 --> 01:23:02.974
This coming from
a fucking homeless guy

01:23:02.998 --> 01:23:04.365
on my new steps.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.777
Face it, guys. You fucking lost.

01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:08.636
Take your fucking filthy paws
off that letter.

01:23:08.671 --> 01:23:10.649
- This letter? -Yeah, that...
Oh, you're so strong.

01:23:10.673 --> 01:23:12.951
- That fucking letter?
- Don't you fucking touch that a-hole!

01:23:12.975 --> 01:23:16.277
Who the fuck's
gonna stop me, man? You?

01:23:16.312 --> 01:23:17.789
[Charlie] We will.

01:23:17.813 --> 01:23:20.481
This fucking guy again?

01:23:21.884 --> 01:23:23.417
Is that the Dean?

01:23:23.452 --> 01:23:26.920
People, we have proof
that we were setup.

01:23:26.955 --> 01:23:28.600
- [Woman] What?
- You see,

01:23:28.624 --> 01:23:30.869
- bullshit.
- We set cameras all over our house

01:23:30.893 --> 01:23:33.327
in order to capture
some memorable moments,

01:23:33.362 --> 01:23:34.995
but in the process,

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:37.042
- we caught something else.
- [Clears throat] Herpes!

01:23:37.066 --> 01:23:39.400
Hey, I haven't had
a fucking outbreak in weeks.

01:23:39.435 --> 01:23:42.069
Mind your god damn business,
sons of bitches.

01:23:42.104 --> 01:23:43.982
Douchenozzle, if you will
do the honors, please.

01:23:44.006 --> 01:23:45.383
I can guarantee you those words

01:23:45.407 --> 01:23:46.751
have never been spoken before.

01:23:46.775 --> 01:23:48.753
- You got it, Charlie.
- [Becca] Damn, girl.

01:23:48.777 --> 01:23:50.889
Yeah, girl, you're an animal.
You're an animal!

01:23:50.913 --> 01:23:53.013
- [Charlie] Animal!
- You have energy!

01:23:53.048 --> 01:23:54.626
- [Tanya moaning]
- Paint party!

01:23:54.650 --> 01:23:56.583
[Becca] Are you seeing this, AJ?

01:23:56.618 --> 01:23:57.818
Come on, actual animal.

01:23:57.853 --> 01:23:59.431
Come on,
shake those tatas, girl.

01:23:59.455 --> 01:24:00.587
Let's go, let's go, yeah.

01:24:00.622 --> 01:24:01.833
Hair back, hair back, [Growls].

01:24:01.857 --> 01:24:04.425
You heartless little strumpet!

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.037
- Wait... what this?
- [Scoffs]

01:24:06.061 --> 01:24:07.772
All this proves
is she's a voyeuristic slut

01:24:07.796 --> 01:24:09.407
with some kind of fucking
rodent fetish.

01:24:09.431 --> 01:24:11.609
- Yeah. -How in any
way does this prove

01:24:11.633 --> 01:24:15.703
-that he's not willing to do this shit?
-[Katie] I'll tell you how.

01:24:15.738 --> 01:24:17.682
- And what the fuck is that?
- The reason that Charlie

01:24:17.706 --> 01:24:20.341
doesn't remember having sex
is because he didn't.

01:24:20.376 --> 01:24:22.609
Well, willingly anyway.

01:24:22.644 --> 01:24:23.988
I dug around in Becca's room

01:24:24.012 --> 01:24:25.790
- and I found this.
- That's bullshit.

01:24:25.814 --> 01:24:28.682
Don't listen to her.
She's just a pathetic loser.

01:24:28.717 --> 01:24:29.983
It's vitamin k.

01:24:30.018 --> 01:24:31.629
It has the same effect
as a roofie

01:24:31.653 --> 01:24:33.754
only ten times more powerful.

01:24:33.789 --> 01:24:37.758
So, I'm a casual drug user.
Big deal.

01:24:37.793 --> 01:24:38.959
Becca dosed Charlie

01:24:38.994 --> 01:24:40.138
and then she paid the porn star

01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:41.762
to have sex with him.

01:24:41.797 --> 01:24:43.475
I... i don't know
what she's talking about.

01:24:43.499 --> 01:24:45.566
The bitch is clearly an idiot.

01:24:45.601 --> 01:24:47.645
I just... you know what... no...
I mean, she just plotted...

01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:50.704
- Shut up, Becca!
- [Crowd groans]

01:24:50.739 --> 01:24:52.906
Fuck, yeah, sis,
right in the mud flaps.

01:24:52.941 --> 01:24:54.541
Also, Dean Kravitz,

01:24:54.576 --> 01:24:55.976
it was AJ and Kappa Nu

01:24:56.011 --> 01:24:58.379
who sabotaged the fireworks
three years ago.

01:24:58.414 --> 01:24:59.791
They're the ones
who are responsible,

01:24:59.815 --> 01:25:01.659
and the alphas
had nothing to do with it.

01:25:01.683 --> 01:25:04.085
And I know this
because I helped them do it.

01:25:06.889 --> 01:25:09.056
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

01:25:10.492 --> 01:25:11.959
Dean Kravitz,

01:25:11.994 --> 01:25:13.060
you're not buying

01:25:13.095 --> 01:25:14.506
this fucking bullshit, are you?

01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:17.564
Actually, AJ, I am.

01:25:17.599 --> 01:25:20.901
- [All groaning]
- What?

01:25:20.936 --> 01:25:24.471
- I hereby declare Alpha house...
- No! This is my house!

01:25:24.506 --> 01:25:26.050
- This is my house!
- I'm gonna whoop his ass.

01:25:26.074 --> 01:25:27.585
- No, no, no, he's mine.
- No, come on.

01:25:27.609 --> 01:25:29.087
I know you're prettier than me,

01:25:29.111 --> 01:25:30.722
-but I'm stronger than you are.
- Yeah.

01:25:30.746 --> 01:25:31.812
[Groans]

01:25:31.847 --> 01:25:34.982
- I'm sorry.
- Ooh!

01:25:35.017 --> 01:25:37.084
Aj? [Groans] Shit!

01:25:37.119 --> 01:25:39.931
- Welcome to Kappa Nu, bitch!
- Fucking asshole, just give it up...

01:25:39.955 --> 01:25:41.922
- [Groaning continues]
- What?

01:25:41.957 --> 01:25:44.024
- Come here!
- Get off me!

01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:47.739
- Fuck you!
- Hey, get back here!

01:25:47.763 --> 01:25:50.197
You fucking pussy! Fuck you!

01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:52.633
[All grunting]

01:25:52.668 --> 01:25:54.579
That was like less harder
than the last time.

01:25:54.603 --> 01:25:56.537
- A-oh!
- [Groans]

01:25:59.875 --> 01:26:02.209
Fuck, my ass! Oh, shit!

01:26:02.244 --> 01:26:04.845
- Ball check.
- [Groans]

01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:10.017
[Screams]

01:26:10.052 --> 01:26:11.496
- Fuck your ass.
- Fuck my ass.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.721
- My fucking foot!
- My ass!

01:26:15.791 --> 01:26:17.691
Ah, fuck!

01:26:17.726 --> 01:26:19.237
Okay, last time, let's go!

01:26:19.261 --> 01:26:22.996
- One, two, three.
- [Grunting continues]

01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:26.066
Ah, shit!
Boy, that was uneventful.

01:26:26.101 --> 01:26:29.136
- [Clicking sound]
- Oh...

01:26:31.773 --> 01:26:33.541
You can thank me later.

01:26:34.943 --> 01:26:37.911
All right, sarge,
guard the perimeter.

01:26:37.946 --> 01:26:39.580
Oh, fuck yeah!

01:26:39.615 --> 01:26:42.082
- Fuck!
- Fuck your foot.
