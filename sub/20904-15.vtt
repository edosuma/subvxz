16:46.739 --> 16:48.574
<b>- Overall, you guys had an off</b>
<b>day.</b>

16:48.641 --> 16:50.977
<b>You don't have that killer</b>
<b>day that you need to lock it up.</b>

16:54.614 --> 16:56.482
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>

16:58.251 --> 17:00.186
<b>Let's start</b>
<b>with Basilica's geometric.</b>

17:00.253 --> 17:01.955
<b>- Erin, this tattoo does not</b>
<b>look like you had</b>

17:02.021 --> 17:03.189
<b>anything to do with it.</b>

17:03.256 --> 17:05.058
<b>A lot of line work problems.</b>

17:05.157 --> 17:07.760
<b>You have a lot of curves,</b>
<b>swoops, dips, bubbles, dents.</b>

17:07.827 --> 17:10.463
<b>This is the most challenged line</b>
<b>work of any of the four</b>

17:10.530 --> 17:12.699
<b>geometric tattoos today.</b>

17:12.765 --> 17:14.666
<b>- Old Town Ink's black and gray.</b>

17:14.733 --> 17:16.368
<b>- Well, Erin, I'd say you're in</b>
<b>the middle of the road</b>

17:16.435 --> 17:18.070
<b>on this one.</b>

17:18.171 --> 17:19.606
<b>That big, bold</b>
<b>outline around the outside of</b>

17:19.672 --> 17:21.540
<b>the iris was a little bit too</b>
<b>much.</b>

17:21.608 --> 17:23.675
<b>A softer ending on that</b>
<b>pupil would have been smarter.</b>

17:23.742 --> 17:25.178
<b>- I let myself get in my own</b>
<b>head today.</b>

17:25.211 --> 17:26.945
<b>- It looks like you at half</b>
<b>speed.</b>

17:27.012 --> 17:29.582
<b>It doesn't look like</b>
<b>full blast.</b>

17:29.649 --> 17:32.352
<b>- Next is Doom's fantasy</b>
<b>illustrative.</b>

17:32.418 --> 17:34.621
<b>- You've set yourself up for</b>
<b>everybody to make changes,</b>

17:34.687 --> 17:37.390
<b>and people made it more</b>
<b>aesthetically pleasing.</b>

17:37.457 --> 17:40.193
<b>A lot of people changed the chin</b>
<b>to make it a little cuter.</b>

17:40.193 --> 17:42.095
<b>If somebody else is gonna take</b>
<b>your design and make a change</b>

17:42.195 --> 17:45.465
<b>that makes it better, that</b>
<b>knocks you down a notch.</b>

17:45.531 --> 17:48.167
<b>- Black Cobra Tattoo's American</b>
<b>traditional.</b>

17:48.234 --> 17:51.404
<b>- Doom, overall, the outline</b>
<b>gets away from you quite a bit.</b>

17:51.471 --> 17:54.407
<b>The banner gets pretty wobbly,</b>
<b>and then also, your line work on</b>

17:54.474 --> 17:57.744
<b>the top leaves go up, make a</b>
<b>U-turn, and come back down.</b>

17:57.810 --> 17:59.979
<b>The bottom leaves, you whipped</b>
<b>two points together,</b>

18:00.046 --> 18:02.649
<b>so you just completely changed</b>
<b>tattoo strategy</b>

18:02.715 --> 18:04.717
<b>in a matter of 45 minutes.</b>

18:04.784 --> 18:06.419
<b>Luckily for you guys,</b>

18:06.486 --> 18:08.588
<b>nobody's going home off these</b>
<b>four tattoos.</b>

18:08.655 --> 18:11.424
<b>- This is a bad day to have this</b>
<b>turnout.</b>

18:14.827 --> 18:17.964
<b>Black Cobra Tattoos.</b>

18:18.031 --> 18:20.266
<b>First up</b>
<b>is Basilica's geometric design.</b>

18:20.333 --> 18:23.970
<b>- I like this monochromatic take</b>
<b>with tones similar enough to be</b>

18:24.037 --> 18:27.040
<b>in the same spectrum, but far</b>
<b>enough apart to really create</b>

18:27.173 --> 18:31.344
<b>this 3-D illusion; These color</b>
<b>choices look really great.</b>

18:31.411 --> 18:33.212
<b>- Old Town Ink's black and gray.</b>

18:33.279 --> 18:35.782
<b>- Matt, the areas that you put</b>
<b>the hyper-focus on--these</b>

18:35.848 --> 18:38.418
<b>eyelashes, the little corner</b>
<b>tear duct, and then the small</b>

18:38.484 --> 18:40.553
<b>details that you have in the</b>
<b>center of the eye</b>

18:40.620 --> 18:43.022
<b>really play nicely here.</b>

18:43.089 --> 18:45.525
<b>- Unkindness Art's fantasy</b>
<b>illustrative.</b>

18:45.591 --> 18:47.827
<b>- You made some positive changes</b>
<b>to this design.</b>

18:47.894 --> 18:49.362
<b>The hairline looks a lot better.</b>

18:49.429 --> 18:51.331
<b>This hard inner bridge of the</b>
<b>nose</b>

18:51.397 --> 18:52.865
<b>really gives the shape of</b>
<b>the face.</b>

18:52.932 --> 18:55.969
<b>I really like how this</b>
<b>one came out.</b>

18:56.035 --> 18:58.438
<b>- Finally, Katie's American</b>
<b>traditional.</b>

18:58.504 --> 19:00.707
<b>- Super solid, super clean</b>
<b>tattoo.</b>

19:00.773 --> 19:03.676
<b>The saturation of all the</b>
<b>colors--very nice, very bright.</b>

19:03.743 --> 19:05.378
<b>Definitely looking good today.</b>

19:05.445 --> 19:07.947
<b>- If I walked into this shop and</b>
<b>saw this portfolio,</b>

19:08.014 --> 19:13.152
<b>I'd be pretty stoked.</b>

19:13.152 --> 19:14.854
<b>All right, let's look at the</b>
<b>head-to-heads.</b>

19:14.921 --> 19:16.889
<b>Who won the geometric?</b>

19:16.956 --> 19:18.491
<b>It's between Noelin</b>
<b>and Katie.</b>

19:18.558 --> 19:19.959
<b>- 100%.</b>
<b>- Obviously.</b>

19:20.026 --> 19:21.728
<b>- I will say for Noelin's</b>
<b>behalf,</b>

19:21.794 --> 19:23.329
<b>that thing is crazy</b>
<b>solid.</b>

19:23.396 --> 19:24.697
<b>- So is that your final</b>
<b>decision?</b>

19:24.764 --> 19:26.232
<b>- I'm going Noelin.</b>

19:26.299 --> 19:28.468
<b>- I'm gonna go with Katie on</b>
<b>this one.</b>

19:28.534 --> 19:30.370
<b>- The line weight on Katie's is</b>
<b>a little stronger.</b>

19:30.436 --> 19:31.571
<b>I like it a</b>
<b>little better.</b>

19:31.638 --> 19:33.339
<b>Going with Katie.</b>

19:33.406 --> 19:35.008
<b>- All right, so, winner of the</b>
<b>geometric head-to-head</b>

19:35.074 --> 19:37.577
<b>is Black Cobra.</b>

19:37.644 --> 19:39.846
<b>Next, Old Town</b>
<b>Ink's black and gray.</b>

19:39.912 --> 19:41.347
<b>- This one's a no-brainer for</b>
<b>me.</b>

19:41.414 --> 19:43.249
<b>- Christian gets this one.</b>

19:43.316 --> 19:44.851
<b>- All right, the winner of this</b>
<b>head-to-head is Basilica.</b>

19:44.917 --> 19:48.388
<b>Congratulations, Christian.</b>

19:48.454 --> 19:51.024
<b>Unkindness Art's fantasy</b>
<b>illustrative.</b>

19:51.124 --> 19:53.893
<b>- Again, very little debate on</b>
<b>this one from myself.</b>

19:53.960 --> 19:55.595
<b>I go with Matt.</b>

19:55.662 --> 19:57.196
<b>- I like DJ's color palette.</b>
<b>That's my vote.</b>

19:57.263 --> 19:58.531
<b>- I love what DJ did.</b>

19:58.598 --> 20:00.133
<b>I love the tentacles.</b>

20:00.133 --> 20:02.135
<b>But as an overall</b>
<b>finished piece,</b>

20:02.168 --> 20:04.604
<b>I prefer Matt's</b>
<b>as well.</b>

20:04.671 --> 20:07.407
<b>Congratulations, Black</b>
<b>Cobra Tattoo.</b>

20:07.473 --> 20:10.410
<b>Finally, Black Cobra Tattoo's</b>
<b>American traditional.</b>

20:10.476 --> 20:12.545
<b>- The two to debate over are</b>
<b>Katie and Christian,</b>

20:12.612 --> 20:15.148
<b>but I like Christian's a little</b>
<b>more muted green and yellow</b>

20:15.148 --> 20:18.151
<b>versus Katie's grass green and</b>
<b>gold.</b>

20:18.184 --> 20:19.786
<b>- Christian. No-brainer.</b>

20:19.852 --> 20:21.888
<b>- All right. Winner of the</b>
<b>head-to-head on American</b>

20:21.955 --> 20:24.590
<b>traditional is Basilica Tattoo.</b>

20:24.657 --> 20:27.860
<b>That means we have two wins for</b>
<b>Basilica Tattoo</b>

20:27.927 --> 20:30.396
<b>and two wins</b>
<b>for Black Cobra Tattoo.</b>

20:30.463 --> 20:34.867
<b>But we came here today to put</b>
<b>one shop in the finale,</b>

20:34.934 --> 20:37.537
<b>so is there a clear winner of</b>
<b>the marathon?</b>

20:37.604 --> 20:40.073
<b>- Both sides had definite great</b>
<b>moments,</b>

20:40.173 --> 20:43.242
<b>and both side had</b>
<b>definite challenges.</b>

20:43.309 --> 20:44.677
<b>- So let me ask you a question,</b>
<b>Dave.</b>

20:44.744 --> 20:46.179
<b>Is it too late to give</b>
<b>them both a spot?</b>

20:46.212 --> 20:47.780
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

20:47.847 --> 20:50.483

<b> <i>♪ ♪</i> </b>

20:59.533 --> 21:00.934

<b>Is it too late to give</b>

21:04.171 --> 21:06.840
<b>- You're saying let Black Cobra</b>
<b>and Basilica go?</b>

21:06.907 --> 21:09.810
<b>- For me, two teams killed it</b>
<b>and two teams didn't.</b>

21:09.876 --> 21:12.646
<b>- I think both these shops</b>
<b>deserve a shot in the finale.</b>

21:12.713 --> 21:14.414
<b>- They're a completely dead</b>
<b>heat.</b>

21:14.481 --> 21:15.916
<b>- Listen, I'll do it.</b>

21:15.982 --> 21:17.784
<b>- [bleep] it. Do it.</b>
<b>- No [bleep] way.</b>

21:17.851 --> 21:21.521
<b>- Basilica Tattoo, Black Cobra</b>
<b>Tattoo, congratulations.</b>

21:21.588 --> 21:23.690
<b>You guys have earned a spot in</b>
<b>the live finale.</b>

21:23.757 --> 21:24.958
<b>- Yeah!</b>

21:25.025 --> 21:27.527
<b>[laughter]</b>

21:27.594 --> 21:30.163
<b>That was way more intense than</b>
<b>last time.</b>

21:30.230 --> 21:31.531
<b>What the [bleep]?</b>

21:34.501 --> 21:37.304
<b>- There are two shops left, but</b>
<b>only one spot remains</b>

21:37.371 --> 21:38.872
<b>in the live finale.</b>

21:38.939 --> 21:40.540
<b>You'll have one last chance to</b>
<b>prove your shop</b>

21:40.607 --> 21:41.942
<b>deserves that spot.</b>

21:42.009 --> 21:43.477
<b>Head back to the loft and</b>

<b>[inaudible] bull[bleep].</b>

<b>Congratulations.</b>

<b>Old Town Ink</b>
<b>and Unkindness Art,</b>

22:40.600 --> 22:42.135
<b>one shop</b>

<b>to fight for the title of Master</b>
<b>Shop,</b>

22:44.404 --> 22:46.707
<b>and one shop will go home.</b>

22:46.773 --> 22:50.243
<b>It all depends on this</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

22:50.310 --> 22:53.246
<b>All season long, you and your</b>
<b>teammate have depended</b>

22:53.313 --> 22:55.782
<b>on your</b>
<b>collective strength as a shop.</b>

22:55.882 --> 22:58.618
<b>You win together and you lose</b>

22:58.685 --> 23:00.587
<b>Today is no exception.</b>

23:00.654 --> 23:02.589
<b>- [groans]</b>

23:02.656 --> 23:05.225
<b>- There's no better way to prove</b>
<b>the strength of your shop than</b>

23:05.292 --> 23:09.363
<b>tag-team tattooing two canvases</b>
<b>at the same time.</b>

23:09.429 --> 23:10.897
<b>- [bleep], man.</b>

23:10.897 --> 23:12.899
<b>- You will switch canvases every</b>
<b>hour,</b>

23:12.966 --> 23:15.902
<b>seamlessly picking up</b>
<b>where your teammate left off.</b>

23:17.204 --> 23:18.905
<b>- God damn.</b>

23:18.905 --> 23:20.907
<b>You guys just can't stop</b>
<b>[bleep]ing us, can you?</b>

23:20.974 --> 23:22.642
<b>This is crazy.</b>

23:22.709 --> 23:24.678
<b>You have to get</b>
<b>used to a tattoo in one hour,</b>

23:24.745 --> 23:26.246
<b>and the second you get used to</b>
<b>it, you have to start another</b>

23:26.313 --> 23:27.247
<b>tattoo and get used to that in</b>
<b>an hour.</b>

23:27.314 --> 23:28.915
<b>It's mayhem.</b>

23:28.982 --> 23:31.551
<b>- For your first canvas, the</b>
<b>style and subject</b>

23:31.618 --> 23:32.986
<b>are completely up to you.</b>

23:33.053 --> 23:35.455
<b>But for</b>
<b>your second canvas,</b>

23:35.522 --> 23:39.092
<b>the power is in the hands of</b>
<b>your opponent.</b>

23:39.159 --> 23:41.128
<b>The opposing shop will choose</b>
<b>the style</b>

23:41.194 --> 23:43.997
<b>and subject you'll tattoo.</b>

23:44.064 --> 23:47.134
<b>- Y'all have watched each other</b>
<b>tattoo side by side for many,</b>

23:47.200 --> 23:48.602
<b>many challenges.</b>

23:48.669 --> 23:50.303
<b>I want to see</b>
<b>tough competition.</b>

23:50.370 --> 23:51.805
<b>Challenge them to make them</b>
<b>prove that they</b>

23:51.938 --> 23:53.674
<b>got to stay here.</b>

23:53.740 --> 23:55.776
<b>- It sucks so bad that we have</b>
<b>to go against somebody</b>

23:55.876 --> 23:58.478
<b>that was in our alliance, but</b>
<b>there's one spot left.</b>

23:58.545 --> 24:00.614
<b>Obviously, we're</b>
<b>gonna screw them over.</b>

24:00.681 --> 24:02.649
<b>- Old Town Ink, what style and</b>
<b>subject</b>

24:02.716 --> 24:04.885
<b>will Unkindness Art tattoo?</b>

24:04.951 --> 24:07.421
<b>- American traditional hot rod.</b>

24:07.487 --> 24:08.955
<b>- Okay.</b>

24:09.022 --> 24:10.223
<b>- You guys always say that</b>
<b>traditional's easy</b>

24:10.290 --> 24:11.792
<b>to pick out flaws in.</b>

24:11.892 --> 24:13.627
<b>Cars are always hard,</b>
<b>any style you do them,</b>

24:13.694 --> 24:16.797
<b>so we just put the two together.</b>

24:16.897 --> 24:18.298
<b>- God damn it.</b>

24:18.365 --> 24:21.168
<b>Neither of us do</b>
<b>American traditional.</b>

24:21.234 --> 24:22.903
<b>- I guess Old Town isn't best</b>
<b>friends</b>

24:22.936 --> 24:24.905
<b>with Unkindness anymore.</b>

24:24.971 --> 24:28.108
<b>They just delivered</b>
<b>them a huge "[bleep] you."</b>

24:28.175 --> 24:30.544
<b>- Unkindness Art, what style</b>
<b>and subject</b>

24:30.610 --> 24:32.546
<b>will Old Town Ink tattoo?</b>

24:32.612 --> 24:35.215
<b>- Color realism, full-bodied</b>
<b>raven.</b>

24:35.282 --> 24:37.818
<b>Color realism's pretty</b>
<b>hard to pull off in six hours,</b>

24:37.918 --> 24:40.654
<b>and they've already struggled</b>
<b>with a raven this season, so...</b>

24:40.721 --> 24:43.056
<b>- They knew that we got hit hard</b>
<b>from a raven already</b>

24:43.123 --> 24:45.826
<b>from the judges, and color</b>
<b>realism in six hours?</b>

24:45.926 --> 24:47.327
<b>This is stuff that takes</b>
<b>multiple sittings.</b>

24:47.394 --> 24:49.329
<b>So they're</b>
<b>trying to screw us too.</b>

24:49.396 --> 24:50.697
<b>- There you have it.</b>

24:50.764 --> 24:52.766
<b>Those are</b>
<b>your assignments.</b>

24:52.833 --> 24:55.702
<b>To prove your shop deserves the</b>
<b>right to battle it out for the</b>

24:55.769 --> 24:58.071
<b>biggest prize in "Ink</b>
<b>Master" history,</b>

24:58.138 --> 25:01.408
<b>you must prove the collective</b>
<b>strength of your shop.</b>

25:01.475 --> 25:04.644
<b>Your canvases have been randomly</b>
<b>assigned,</b>

25:04.711 --> 25:07.180
<b>and you will have six hours to</b>
<b>tattoo,</b>
