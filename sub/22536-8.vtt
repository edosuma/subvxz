00:01.930 --> 00:03.921
Previously on
crisis...
If you took those kids

00:03.930 --> 00:05.158
To use their parents,

00:05.170 --> 00:07.195
Use us.
The Cla

00:07.200 --> 00:09.634
Is holding a man
at 836 north humphrey avenue.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.834
You are to get this man.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.205
You have exactly three hours

00:12.210 --> 00:13.507
To do this for me.

00:13.510 --> 00:14.704
You have good hands.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.530
But I am not a good person.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.108
I've met a lot worse lately.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.600
What you want those men to do

00:19.620 --> 00:21.372
For you is not science.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.540
Let me come to you, we can talk.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.211
Look, you have those soldiers.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.778
That‘s what you want

00:25.790 --> 00:27.439
We only got one soldier in.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.859
That should be more than enough.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.124
(buzzing, popping)
(francis yells)

00:31.130 --> 00:32.950
(gunfire)

00:32.960 --> 00:34.552
Everyone, stay down!

00:34.560 --> 00:35.959
There's no way out!
We can't get out!

00:35.970 --> 00:37.995
Yeah, but-but they
can't get in, either.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.991
What you should do,
what both of you should do,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.468
Is go back out the door
you came through.

00:42.470 --> 00:43.698
Dunn:
Tnatis not gonna happen.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.564
(yelling)
clarenbach?

00:45.570 --> 00:47.208
I'm on my way
to see your sister.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.632
And I got a dumpster
all picked out

00:48.640 --> 00:50.073
For her when I'm through.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.547
So, why don't
you just, uh, check

00:51.550 --> 00:53.745
And make sure
that you didn't walk away

00:53.750 --> 00:55.741
With something
that doesn't belong to you.

00:58.390 --> 01:02.019
I'm gonna call the fbi handlers
outside meg's house.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.681
(line ringing)

01:03.690 --> 01:06.250
(phone ringing)

01:08.600 --> 01:10.022
No one's answering.

01:10.030 --> 01:12.464
Call your sister.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.071
(grunts)
this can't happen!

01:22.080 --> 01:23.729
My daughter...

01:23.750 --> 01:27.049
That's good. Fight!
Get it all out.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.870
(phone ringing)

01:28.880 --> 01:31.986
(meg grunting)
hand me the phone.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.188
Dunn:
Meg, go to your safe room now.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.988
Oh, it's a little late
for that, sweetheart.

01:42.460 --> 01:44.928
I told you I'd take her,
and I did.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.727
Now, you listen to me.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.436
You take dr. Clarenbach

01:49.440 --> 01:50.930
To the intersection

01:50.940 --> 01:52.134
Of pennsylvania and k street.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.608
Any sign of an fbi agent,

01:54.610 --> 01:56.805
Any sign whatsoever,

01:56.810 --> 01:58.949
Meg dies.

01:58.950 --> 02:01.839
No!

02:06.120 --> 02:07.212
Hey!

02:07.220 --> 02:08.619
I know why widener wants you.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.815
But I want to know why
the kidnapper wants you!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.752
Why do you keep referring
to him as the kidnapper?

02:12.760 --> 02:14.421
We all know the person
who took those children

02:14.430 --> 02:15.829
Is francis gibson.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.761
What's our status?

02:23.770 --> 02:25.738
Well, your daughter,
that kid ian

02:25.740 --> 02:28.174
And the first brat are
barricaded in the wine cellar.

02:28.180 --> 02:29.932
They have a gun.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.305
Most of our surveillance
cams are shot out.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.846
Death toll stands at six.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.148
Four ours, the bastard
that killed them,

02:36.150 --> 02:38.516
And your now-worthless patsy.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.114
You got a back-up plan in your
little book for this cluster?

02:41.120 --> 02:42.519
The plan was constructed
to withstand

02:42.530 --> 02:44.589
Catastrophic setbacks.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.150
And this is far
from catastrophic.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.320
Open a line.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.457
I need a minute
to make It secure.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.459
What are you doing?

02:51.470 --> 02:53.119
Those feds, finley and dunn,

02:53.140 --> 02:54.164
Have clarenbach.

02:54.170 --> 02:55.467
I still need him.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.836
Why do you need him?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.001
You did
what no one else could do.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.830
You took those kids.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.932
You got us rich.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.372
Maybe it's time to end this.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.779
Save the kids. Be a hero.

03:05.780 --> 03:06.769
Go home.

03:06.780 --> 03:09.613
No. I can't go home yet.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.178
We are in a war with widener.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.283
And if I don't ﬁnish him,
we're all dead.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.655
You, too, koz.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.855
Rich, but dead.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.784
To destroy widener,
I still need clarenbach.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.552
I have your secure line.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.525
These soldiers represent
the global network

03:27.540 --> 03:30.031
Of mercenaries daddy
has deployed all over the world.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.067
Right now they're launching
a scorched earth campaign.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.479
You know what for?

03:35.480 --> 03:37.004
To find emma?

03:37.010 --> 03:37.999
That's right, leo.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.001
To find your big sister.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.309
Then will the bad man take me?

03:44.320 --> 03:46.083
(phone rigning)
no.

03:46.090 --> 03:47.489
I would never let that happen.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.811
Then why'd you let
them take emma?

03:52.990 --> 03:54.321
Sir, you have a call.

03:54.330 --> 03:57.049
It came in
on my personal cell phone.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.389
(distorted): Mr. Vries,
do you know who this is?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.061
I'm the one parent
who's been waiting

04:03.070 --> 04:04.492
Impatiently for your call.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.831
Tell me what you want done.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.774
Nothing that your mercenaries
haven't done

04:08.780 --> 04:11.874
Countless times overseas.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.279
For any foreign nation able
to meet your price,

04:13.280 --> 04:14.611
You've whored out your men

04:14.620 --> 04:15.917
For snatch and grabs.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.376
In exchange for your daughter,

04:17.390 --> 04:19.244
You need to do one here.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.386
That's it?

04:20.390 --> 04:21.414
You need to slip

04:21.420 --> 04:22.580
Your fbi handlers.

04:22.590 --> 04:25.184
That won't be a problem.

04:26.890 --> 04:29.199
(beeping, lock thumps)

04:36.600 --> 04:38.033
How do you know it's gibson?

04:38.040 --> 04:39.530
Because the kidnapper
isn't targeting

04:39.540 --> 04:40.905
The cia,
they're going after widener.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.468
And widener screwed gibson.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.471
How did widener screw gibson?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.310
The prog... The program we ran,

04:48.320 --> 04:51.118
There was a... A massacre.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.441
Widener put gibson's name on it,
and then he put

04:53.460 --> 04:55.553
A target on his daughter's heart
to keep him quiet.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.755
Wide_ner threatened to kill
gibson's daughter?

04:57.760 --> 04:59.227
Yeah.

04:59.230 --> 05:01.596
So it's personal.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.921
And I assume
that's why gIbson wants me.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.898
_ To use me
against wrdener somehow.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.334
Okay, that's not gonna happen.

05:08.340 --> 05:11.138
We're gonna use you
to get gibson.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.801
We're gonna show you everything
we have on the kidnapping,

05:12.810 --> 05:14.459
And you're gonna tell us exactly

05:14.480 --> 05:16.107
How gibson is planning
to use you.

05:16.110 --> 05:17.737
Who are his known associates?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.445
Who is helping him
on the outside?

05:19.450 --> 05:21.315
How he is communicating
with the parents.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.572
You're the key to gibson.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.309
You are gonna
open him up for us.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.117
He knows gibson.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.088
This is the best shot we
have of finding those kids.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.957
Yeah, all the information is on
the secure server in the fbi.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.188
If we want to show him

05:34.200 --> 05:35.519
What we have on
the kidnapping,

05:35.530 --> 05:36.997
We have to take him
into the fbi.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.592
If widener's people find out

05:38.600 --> 05:41.023
We took him into custody,
they will kill meg.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.031
Okay, you get him into the fbi.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.962
You show him everything
we have on the kidnapping.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.631
Just make sure
no one sees you, okay?

05:46.640 --> 05:47.937
I
get him there?

05:47.940 --> 05:49.305
And what will you be doing?

05:49.310 --> 05:50.334
I'm gonna get my sister.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.601
Dunn?

05:51.610 --> 05:52.872
What happens when you show up

05:52.880 --> 05:55.110
To the exchange
without clarenbach?

05:55.120 --> 05:57.509
I think I have a plan,
but I'm gonna need his clothes.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.488
Are you sure about this?

05:59.490 --> 06:01.117
She's my sister.
I'm gonna get her.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.111
You use him, find gibson.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.859
(engine starts)

06:06.030 --> 06:07.383
He took his own daughter.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.823
What?

06:09.830 --> 06:12.719
If it is gibson,
he took his own daughter.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.664
He had his finger cut off.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.968
And he made her watch.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.879
Go, get me his clothes.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.075
Then you get meg,
and I'll get gibson.

06:29.150 --> 06:30.572
We need to get all
the hostages together

06:30.590 --> 06:32.148
In one room until our in-house

06:32.150 --> 06:34.015
Surveillance cams
are back onllne.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.659
This is a big house,
and we're blind.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.719
No, then they'll know
how weak we are.

06:38.730 --> 06:41.528
Have your remaining men
walk continuous rounds

06:41.530 --> 06:42.997
Until our cameras
are up and running.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.353
And what about your daughter?

06:44.370 --> 06:48.192
We breach the door,
take the room?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.360
(knocking)

06:49.370 --> 06:51.235
Man: All right,
easy or hard?!

06:51.240 --> 06:52.764
Last chance!

06:52.780 --> 06:53.860
We have to open the door!

06:53.880 --> 06:54.778
We cannot
open the door!

06:54.780 --> 06:56.338
You two go.
No.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.999
I shot their leader.
I'm the one they want.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.444
Which is exactly why you
cannot open the door, okay?

07:00.450 --> 07:02.441
They cut off my dad's finger
for trying to grab a gun.

07:02.450 --> 07:03.849
They will kill you
for what you did.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.545
What I did was kill hurst.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.643
Hurst!

07:09.390 --> 07:12.848
He was more of a father
to me than my own dad.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.122
And I killed him.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.257
I killed him with this gun.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.626
Maybe you should put
the gun down, all right, lqle?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.858
Hey, why'd the pounding stop?

07:25.710 --> 07:27.928
What are they gonna do now?

07:27.940 --> 07:29.532
I don't know.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.233
No. We don't breach.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.399
I won't risk that.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.810
Leave them there,
start your rounds.

07:34.820 --> 07:37.744
We start at the top.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.889
Work our way down.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.051
And do it again.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.985
When do I get surveillance back

07:47.000 --> 07:48.558
In the room
where my daughter is?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.494
We don't.
We didn't put cameras

07:50.500 --> 07:52.127
In that part of the house.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.229
Whoever attacked this place
must've hit them hard.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.739
If we're ever gonna
get out of here,

08:06.750 --> 08:09.378
This is our chance.

08:22.430 --> 08:23.920
Oh, my god.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.990
It's okay, it's okay.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.535
They lost four of their own.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.428
We need to search them.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.032
Those gunmen,

08:37.050 --> 08:38.677
They all had radios.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.045
Maybe they left one on a body.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.847
We need to search them.

08:41.850 --> 08:45.388
That's smart.

09:00.030 --> 09:02.863
Sir?_ We have_a
pOSSIble Situation

09:02.870 --> 09:04.337
With one of the parents.
The handlers sitting

09:04.340 --> 09:05.967
On the fitch residence
haven't checked in,

09:05.970 --> 09:07.460
They aren't responding
to my calls.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.209
Get swat and hrt

09:09.210 --> 09:11.178
To the fitch residence.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.478
We have a possible
parent mission in play.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.142
The second anyone
has eyes on meg fitch,

09:16.150 --> 09:17.549
I'm to be informed.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.040
Agent dunn hasn't checked in?

09:19.050 --> 09:20.642
No, sir.
But the secret service agent

09:20.660 --> 09:22.150
She was working with

09:22.160 --> 09:24.253
Just used his keycard to
swipe into the building

09:24.260 --> 09:25.386
Seven minutes ago.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.051
Finley and not dunn?

09:27.060 --> 09:28.596
That's right, sir.
Just finley.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.251
Find him and bring him to me.
Yes, sir.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.534
These are the parents
gibson has used so far.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.735
Is there a pattern here
that we're missing?

09:38.740 --> 09:41.868
No. I don't see one.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.575
(typing)

09:43.580 --> 09:46.674
These are the targets
he's gone after.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.240
Well, they're all
widener-related, but you know

09:49.250 --> 09:51.241
That already.
Look again.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.582
Look at this,
and tell me what you see.

09:53.590 --> 09:55.751
This is a_ massive_ amount
of Information.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.384
These are
the two soldiers we took

09:58.390 --> 09:59.618
Out of the pakistani embassy.

09:59.630 --> 10:00.949
Yes, thayer and hawkins.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.927
They're part of the program.

10:01.930 --> 10:02.954
Widener's hit team.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.063
Where are they now?

10:05.070 --> 10:06.423
Last time I saw them,

10:06.440 --> 10:07.623
Widener was going to
let gibson take them.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.289
Why would widener want that?

10:09.300 --> 10:12.531
So that they would kill gibson.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.599
Sir?

10:14.610 --> 10:16.237
Agent finley's logged

10:16.240 --> 10:18.777
Into the kidnapping database.

10:18.780 --> 10:19.906
From where?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.205
One second,
and I can tell you.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.871
If gibson was attacked,

10:23.890 --> 10:25.812
He could be weak.

10:25.820 --> 10:28.709
Even weak, he's
smarter than you.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.255
No, wait.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.251
Go back a screen.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.252
Yeah.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.363
I know that.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.434
Got him.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.839
He's in the server room.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.001
Go invite agent
finley up here.

10:47.010 --> 10:50.673
Yes, sir.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.409
This place?

10:52.410 --> 10:54.241
This is where gibson's
holding the children?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.514
Based on the recollection
of the released kids.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.748
You recognize it?

10:59.120 --> 11:02.089
Yeah, I was there once

11:02.090 --> 11:03.409
With gibson.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.749
(sighs)
he's smart.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.988
You'll never
find it.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.424
Where is it?

11:08.430 --> 11:11.297
Well...

11:11.300 --> 11:13.518
Now we need to
discuss a deal.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.036
You want witness
protection,

11:16.040 --> 11:17.667
I can give
you that...
You must be joking.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.262
Widener would find me
in Witness protection.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.498
No. You turn your back

11:20.510 --> 11:22.205
On me and
let me walk,

11:22.210 --> 11:24.178
I'll show you where
this place is

11:24.180 --> 11:25.602
And I'll take
care of myself.

11:25.610 --> 11:27.999
Look again. Be sure.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.448
You know

11:30.450 --> 11:32.384
Where _this
place is?

11:32.390 --> 11:36.156
Yes, agent finley.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.889
And I can take
you there.

11:39.890 --> 11:41.790
(typing)

11:41.800 --> 11:43.950
Let's go.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.733
There's nothing.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.368
No radios, no keys,
no weapons on any of them.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.631
Nothing.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.369
Aaron...

11:57.380 --> 11:58.540
Look.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.745
Amber, this is an
exterior wall.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.445
This door leads outside.

12:12.590 --> 12:14.251
I'm not coming back from this.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.148
By the end of the day
I'll either be dead or in jail.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.321
The government will
come after my business.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.764
Make sure everything is
signed over to my wife.

12:20.770 --> 12:22.192
Fbi agent:
Sorry, mr. Vries.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.895
Afraid we can't let you
out of our sight.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.162
Ah, my fbi handlers.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.502
(elevator bell dings)

12:28.510 --> 12:31.172
(air hissing)

12:31.180 --> 12:32.909
(sighs)

12:32.910 --> 12:36.414
Did you know I was assigned more
handlers than any other parent?

12:36.420 --> 12:39.344
I assaulted federal agents.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.908
I'm prepared to do much worse.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.252
I'll take full responsibility.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.182
You had nothing to
do with this, sir.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.589
Your men will
swear to it.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.091
These men would
die for you.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.352
Let's go get
your daughter.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.874
(tires squealing)

13:09.980 --> 13:12.380
Okay...

13:12.390 --> 13:14.278
(phone ringing)

13:14.290 --> 13:15.712
Where the hell have you been?

13:15.720 --> 13:16.789
Please, sir, just listen...

13:16.790 --> 13:18.826
No, you listen to me.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.320
Since you've gone off the grid,

13:20.330 --> 13:22.491
Four agents on jakob vries
were found unconscious

13:22.500 --> 13:24.821
And the two on your sister
are in the wind.

13:24.830 --> 13:27.060
As are vries and your sister.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.799
I would have told this
to your partner,

13:28.800 --> 13:29.994
But he blew through here

13:30.010 --> 13:31.295
Without checking in.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.800
I need your help
or my sister meg dies.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.108
If your sister is
on a parent mission

13:35.110 --> 13:36.771
And you're asking me
to facilitate it...

13:36.780 --> 13:39.169
It's not the kidnapper
who has her, sir.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.602
It's the kidnapper's target.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.042
Widener has her.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.185
Widener...

13:47.490 --> 13:48.752
What do you need?

13:48.760 --> 13:50.978
I'm an fbi agent.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.859
I need the fbi.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.033
You plan to take
the mansion by yourself?

14:04.040 --> 14:06.668
No, I'll call plenty of backup
when we get there.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.205
These are to make sure
we do get there.

14:09.210 --> 14:10.438
Lots of people want you.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.042
Gibson, widener...

14:12.050 --> 14:13.779
They're not going to wait
for me to turn you over.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.099
They will come after us.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.974
You know how to
use one of these?

14:16.990 --> 14:18.742
The open end
points away from you?

14:20.050 --> 14:22.610
Am I still
heading this way?

14:22.620 --> 14:24.383
Toward 95 north.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.257
Yea/7.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.808
(heavy thunk)

14:45.810 --> 14:47.004
Bolted solid.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.840
Must be some kind of
security door.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.818
We need a key.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.287
I know where we are.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.182
Fort hovings.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.555
United states army.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.913
We're in
an army base?

14:57.930 --> 14:59.750
Out of service
and abandoned.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.159
Decommissioned
three years ago.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.151
This was the base
commander's house.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.559
Why would they
put us here?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.266
Because it's 300
deserted square acres

15:07.270 --> 15:09.363
Surrounded by barbed wire
and "keep out" signs.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.634
We'r_e never
getting out.

15:12.610 --> 15:15.431
Yes, we are.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.135
I have an idea.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.212
Boss, I can't get
the geo-locator back online.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.415
I can't track
agent finley's phone.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.741
Open a
phone line.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.980
(line ringing)

15:33.560 --> 15:34.754
Do you have the coordinates?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.455
I need you to
track the target.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.122
What has happened to
the data you promised me?

15:39.130 --> 15:40.290
Do you have a problem?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.699
(distorted):
No problem.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.260
The fbi is now looking for you.

15:44.270 --> 15:47.535
Find clarenbach
before the fbi finds you

15:47.540 --> 15:51.135
Or you'll be in jail
for your daughter's funeral.

16:01.490 --> 16:04.618
(phone ringing)

16:06.060 --> 16:07.322
You get your sister?

16:07.330 --> 16:08.422
No, not yet.

16:08.430 --> 16:09.829
But finley, listen...

16:09.830 --> 16:11.320
I know which parent

16:11.330 --> 16:12.922
Gibson is sending after you
to get clarenbach.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.330
It's jakob vries.

16:15.340 --> 16:16.796
Red iron.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.266
Military
contractor.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.908
Yeah, the guy's got an army.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.468
Finley, listen, if you want

16:21.480 --> 16:23.072
To come into _the fbi
for protection,

16:23.080 --> 16:25.230
I'll understand.
I'll keep heading this way.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.569
Vries is coming for you.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.275
I can only imagine
what he'll bring

16:28.280 --> 16:29.508
To get his daughter back.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.839
Go get meg.

16:30.850 --> 16:32.340
I'll get the kids.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.028
You_ want to track
anything on the road,

16:52.040 --> 16:54.508
You use the taxi network.

16:54.510 --> 16:56.774
One of them spotted
clarenbach and agent finley

16:56.780 --> 16:58.600
Headed towards maryland.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.840
We've got him.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.858
Fbi agent (over radio):
All agents are in place
and ready for the exchange,

17:08.860 --> 17:10.714
Agent dunn.
All right, come and get him.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.119
We a go?

17:13.130 --> 17:14.449
Keep your face down.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.758
You don't look
that much like him.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.767
Are you seeing this?

17:24.140 --> 17:25.562
/V0, 1' don’t think
he’s widener’s.

17:25.570 --> 17:26.832
But if widener's men

17:26.840 --> 17:28.569
Think he's fbi, meg is dead.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.070
Hold your position.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.013
Sir, I'm sorry,
you can't be here.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.510
What about my money?

17:37.520 --> 17:39.841
I don't have
any cash on me.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.841
You're supposed
to give me $100.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.078
For what?

17:45.060 --> 17:46.550
Who told you to
come talk to me?

17:46.560 --> 17:48.084
He said you'd give me $100,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.749
I give you...

17:49.760 --> 17:51.489
Hold your position.
Do not fire.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.922
He's not armed.
Hold your fire.

17:52.930 --> 17:54.568
...This.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.779
Who gave you this?

18:04.780 --> 18:07.101
Where is the person
that gave you this?

18:10.080 --> 18:10.876
(neck cracks)

18:10.890 --> 18:12.289
Meg.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.021
It's not your sister.
I know where she is.

18:20.030 --> 18:22.328
If you want to see her,
come with me now.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.691
How did he lie to me?

18:31.710 --> 18:33.462
Hurst.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.402
Every day, I saw him.
I know his wife.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.537
I know his little girl, tory.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.472
Kyle...
She's just
eight.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.142
But I saw him aim
that gun at your dad.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.276
I saw him shoot finley.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.373
I saw it, too.
We all did.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.711
His little girl...

18:47.720 --> 18:49.608
What am I supposed say to her
if I get out of here?

18:49.620 --> 18:51.258
I'm the guy that
killed her dad.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.659
No, no...

18:52.660 --> 18:54.321
Should've killed
more of them.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.820
Should've killed 'em all.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.234
Hey, there's
something back here.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.477
'7 “41 ,ITli'y';-IE;L'— 1&7; "11.;37327'71-geii-2; ::?‘%‘:f:%_f:;:>,:7 :7 f::<:; ~ ;- 1! 1»: aft: (( '( ‘( 7 ‘7 :7 7, ; ‘ ‘5 7-9: 7/71/71/7 —;/’ <_ 77/; 1 7

19:10.740 --> 19:12.173
Where the hell's
the key pad?

19:12.180 --> 19:13.647
It's just an old
intercom system,

19:13.650 --> 19:15.003
For the servants.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.113
Usually only goes
to the kitchen.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.839
That's where the
kidnappers are.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.182
(static crackling)

19:22.190 --> 19:24.579
Agent finley is a trained
secret service agent.

19:24.590 --> 19:26.319
When attacked,
he will fight back.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.581
No need to tell me my job.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.851
He will return fire.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.293
He will drive evasively.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.598
Moving cars and bullets
may endanger clarenbach.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.465
You need to take care
that he's not injured.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.664
I need clarenbach alive.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.638
If he dies,
so does your daughter.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.461
If anything happens to my emma,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.539
I will kill you with my hands.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.531
Anger is good.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.199
Anger can be focused.

19:46.210 --> 19:47.472
Focus yours.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.119
Give me your heading.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.610
Traveling north,

19:51.620 --> 19:56.512
Currently cutting through
the town of oxon hill.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.181
They're heading this way.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.724
(static crackling,
indistinct voices mixed in)

20:02.730 --> 20:04.220
I heard him say "finley."

20:05.200 --> 20:06.724
Maybe he's
looking for us.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.138
Maybe he's close.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.028
(tires squealing)

20:12.210 --> 20:13.666
Clarenbach:
If g/bson wants to use me,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.500
It's either 'cause
of what I know--

20:15.510 --> 20:17.728
And that-that can put
widener away for life--

20:17.750 --> 20:19.149
Or it's 'cause of
what I can do.

20:19.150 --> 20:20.708
Now, I make
the drug

20:20.720 --> 20:22.472
That makes those soldiers kill,
but if gibson wants

20:22.480 --> 20:24.311
To use the drug,
then he's gonna need soldiers

20:24.320 --> 20:26.845
From the program.
You can't just inject anybody

20:26.850 --> 20:28.647
And expect them to kill.
It took us months

20:28.660 --> 20:30.480
To get enough pharmaceutical
inside their bodies to elicit

20:30.490 --> 20:32.048
The correct
reaction.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.379
Do you think that's
what he wants?
Stop talking.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.426
I'm trying to help.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.853
And I'm telling you
to shut your mouth. Now.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.690
(helicopter blades whirring)

20:39.700 --> 20:41.395
That's a helicopter.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.992
They're using a bloody
helicopter to track us.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.059
It's vries' army.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.765
It's red iron.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.863
He’s a parent; too.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.869
Pilot (over radio):
This Is little bird one.
We are over target.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.279
Target is moving at speed

20:51.280 --> 20:52.542
And appears to be armed.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.438
I'm going to stop the car.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.213
We're getting out.
Are you mad?

20:56.220 --> 20:58.074
There's a helicopter,
most probably armed, above us.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.910
I was a cop for three years.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.888
The only people who get away
when they're being chased

21:01.890 --> 21:03.778
By a chopper are the people
who get out of the car.

21:03.790 --> 21:05.052
(sighs)

21:05.060 --> 21:06.721
Here we go.

21:06.730 --> 21:10.097
(tires squealing)

21:14.970 --> 21:16.892
Pilot:
Lost them.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.731
Say again.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.731
They have left the car,
they're traveling on foot,

21:20.740 --> 21:23.038
28 degrees north of you.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.544
Let's go hunting.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.210
Tjs:
The phone is secure. Go ahead.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.586
Have you heard from that soldier
that got to where gibson is?

21:37.590 --> 21:41.424
No, but we can assume
he inflicted optimal damage.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.728
The fact that you haven't heard
from him... Presumed dead?

21:43.730 --> 21:45.095
Yes.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.489
Remember, the primary target
was gibson.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.764
Gibson could be dead, too.

21:49.770 --> 21:50.930
What about our other problem?

21:50.940 --> 21:52.237
Have you found clarenbach?

21:53.240 --> 21:55.265
I'm working on that right now.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.736
Where's her cell phone?

21:56.740 --> 21:58.833
In the trash
with her badge and gun.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.173
(sighs)

22:02.180 --> 22:04.717
Chain her up.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.508
What the hell were you thinking,

22:10.530 --> 22:12.418
Coming here?

22:12.430 --> 22:14.250
You should be trying
to save amber, not me.

22:14.260 --> 22:16.820
The plan was to do both.

22:26.370 --> 22:28.167
Now you call
for backup, right?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.431
We're gonna get
to safer ground,

22:29.440 --> 22:30.998
Then I'll call my partner.

22:31.010 --> 22:32.375
If her sister's safe,
I'll call for backup.

22:32.380 --> 22:34.268
But right now,
you're gonna tell me

22:34.280 --> 22:36.009
Where those kids
are at right now!

22:36.020 --> 22:38.341
If I do,
you won't need me at all!

22:38.350 --> 22:39.612
I'm sorry, I am.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.144
No, I need to be
somewhere safe first.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.684
(tires squealing)
very safe.

22:42.690 --> 22:44.351
And you need to get me there.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.180
Come on.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.223
Agent dunn,

22:55.240 --> 22:56.798
Really great to see you.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.665
I've got a question for you.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.399
Where's dr. Clarenbach?

23:03.410 --> 23:05.628
Screw you.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.170
(grunts)
meg.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.319
I'm okay.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.469
I'm good.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.718
Next time it's my fist.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.415
Meg: You want to
see clarenbach

23:14.420 --> 23:16.513
So badly, why don't you...

23:16.520 --> 23:17.919
Tell your boss, widener,

23:17.930 --> 23:19.659
To come down
and get his hands dirty?

23:19.660 --> 23:22.857
No, no, no, no, I'm the one
with the dirty hands.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.157
As for you,

23:24.170 --> 23:26.263
I know your partner
has clarenbach.

23:26.270 --> 23:28.488
Why don't you just tell me
where he is?

23:28.500 --> 23:31.890
Clarenbach knows
about the kidnappers.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.435
He can help us find amber.

23:36.010 --> 23:38.729
I can't give him up.

23:43.020 --> 23:46.012
Why don't you tell him what you
told him last time, suze.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.255
Go on, tell him.

23:51.260 --> 23:53.524
Screw you!

23:54.530 --> 23:56.418
Meg!

23:59.270 --> 24:00.760
I will kill you.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.192
Do you understand?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.430
I will put my gun

24:04.440 --> 24:06.965
Down your throat,
and I will kill you!

24:09.440 --> 24:11.374
(sighs)

24:11.380 --> 24:12.870
She really looks up to you.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.474
I can see that.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.119
So here's what I'm gonna do.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.111
I'm gonna get a knife,

24:20.120 --> 24:22.987
And I'm gonna cut
into your little sister

24:22.990 --> 24:24.912
Unﬁlyou

24:24.930 --> 24:27.490
Tell her it's okay
to talk to me.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.673
(grunts)

24:42.680 --> 24:45.478
_ _ (crying)
this is a tough way to get you
to spend time with me.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.778
(chuckles)

24:47.780 --> 24:49.645
(sighs)

24:49.650 --> 24:52.414
I'm gonna get you out of here.

24:53.420 --> 24:55.513
I don't think so, suze.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.156
So jonas knows
how to get the kids back?

25:04.160 --> 25:06.219
So we got to hang tough.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.929
The dunn sisters, huh?

25:13.710 --> 25:16.372
The dunn sisters.

25:17.710 --> 25:19.940
(indistinct conversation)

25:25.150 --> 25:27.186
They're doing vertical searches
through each building.

25:27.190 --> 25:29.146
From what I can see,
there are only six of them.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.378
"only"?
There are only two of us,

25:31.390 --> 25:32.823
And I really wouldn't count me.

25:32.830 --> 25:35.958
(sighs)

25:35.960 --> 25:38.554
(metallic scraping)

25:41.540 --> 25:43.792
Meg, I want you
to promise me.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.028
Close your eyes.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.905
When it happens,

25:46.910 --> 25:49.003
Close your eyes

25:49.010 --> 25:51.137
And think of amber.

25:53.810 --> 25:56.040
(scraping continues)

26:01.690 --> 26:04.181
(sniffling)
the simmons house.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.259
What?

26:05.260 --> 26:06.852
(gulps)

26:06.860 --> 26:09.021
When we were kids,
you were scared

26:09.030 --> 26:11.225
Of that house on the corner,
the creepy house.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.191
I used to tell you
to close your eyes

26:15.200 --> 26:16.633
Every time we walked by.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.601
(sighs)
and when we'd walk by,

26:20.610 --> 26:21.838
You'd hold my hand.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.728
Except that one time.

26:23.740 --> 26:27.176
I told you we were past
when we weren't.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.068
(chuckles)

26:29.080 --> 26:31.913
(sniffles)
I remember.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.911
(scraping continues)

26:33.920 --> 26:35.342
I'm sorry.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.581
It's okay.

26:43.260 --> 26:46.366
You could've raised her, susie.

26:47.530 --> 26:50.431
I know I told you
that you couldn't,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.067
But (sighs)

26:52.070 --> 26:54.903
You're strong,

26:54.910 --> 26:58.732
And you're good.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.945
You could've raised her.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.156
(meg crying)

27:10.160 --> 27:11.787
You close your eyes

27:11.790 --> 27:14.281
Until we're past, yeah?

27:17.900 --> 27:19.322
Well, are we ready?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.764
Just shut up
and get it over with.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.238
That's what I thought.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.061
That's why it's going
into meg instead.

27:27.070 --> 27:28.401
(gasping)

27:30.750 --> 27:33.071
No, god, I'll do it!

27:33.080 --> 27:34.399
I'll do it!

27:34.420 --> 27:35.842
(sighs)

27:35.850 --> 27:38.216
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

27:49.260 --> 27:51.091
(whispering):
You have to call for backup.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.489
Not until my partner's sister
is safe.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.718
(loud banging)

28:01.640 --> 28:03.835
(phone buzzing)

28:04.940 --> 28:06.100
Hello?

28:06.110 --> 28:07.543
_ (crying)
finley, it's me.

28:07.550 --> 28:08.847
Where are you, dunn?

28:08.850 --> 28:12.377
Finley, I-I need you to
bring him here.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.449
Bring clarenbach here.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.984
What? We can't turn him over.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.548
Dunn, what happened?

28:17.560 --> 28:19.881
Finley, listen to me, okay?

28:19.890 --> 28:21.824
(crying);
It's bad, all right?

28:21.830 --> 28:24.025
It's real bad.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.327
(grunts softly)

28:25.330 --> 28:26.797
It's real bad, finley.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.461
Okay, is the old man there?

28:29.470 --> 28:30.664
Yeah.

28:30.670 --> 28:32.900
Put him on.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.735
Agent finley.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.968
I'm willing
to give you clarenbach.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.369
What?
But you're gonna have
to come get him.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.848
The kidnapper sent a parent
mission to get clarenbach.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.579
If you want him,
you better come quick.

28:46.590 --> 28:49.081
Burnt-out industrial building
on 6th and roosevelt

28:49.090 --> 28:51.058
In oxon hill.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.516
You just gave me up.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.259
I just bought my partner
some time

28:54.260 --> 28:56.990
And hopefully pitted two people
that want you so badly

28:57.000 --> 28:58.149
Against each other.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.092
Now, come on.
We got to keep moving.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.988
Gibson is still operational.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.092
How do we know this?

29:03.100 --> 29:04.260
Because he's using

29:04.270 --> 29:05.828
The ballard parents

29:05.840 --> 29:07.501
To find the same man
we're looking for.

29:07.510 --> 29:10.775
Clarenbach is crucial to _
the pharmaceutical Side of this.

29:10.780 --> 29:14.546
Two years and $200 million
if we want to redevelop it.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.939
You cannot let gibson get him.

29:16.950 --> 29:19.714
I wasn't planning to.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.585
(crying)

29:21.590 --> 29:22.716
They're leaving.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.608
They'll be back.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.120
Whatever finley said
led the old man

29:26.130 --> 29:27.825
And a few of them away, okay?

29:28.630 --> 29:29.927
All right.

29:29.930 --> 29:32.091
I was gonna get him, susie.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.965
Gibson.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.460
I was gonna take his money.

29:35.470 --> 29:37.791
I was gonna track
it and take it.

29:38.770 --> 29:40.237
He may be run by ideas,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.708
But I imagine that everyone
that works for him

29:42.710 --> 29:44.769
Wants to be paid.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.543
I was gonna get him, susie.

29:46.550 --> 29:49.644
You still don't think
we're getting out of here, huh?

29:51.580 --> 29:53.241
Meg,

29:53.250 --> 29:55.241
What's it say
in that book of yours?

29:55.260 --> 29:56.909
(scoffs)

29:56.920 --> 29:58.615
What's it say
in that book of yours

29:58.630 --> 30:00.052
About-about negative thoughts?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.696
I come out against them.

30:04.630 --> 30:06.495
That's right.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.525
(chains jingling)

30:11.100 --> 30:13.330
(groaning)

30:14.670 --> 30:18.401
And yes, I read your book.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.805
Mr. Vries,
agent finley is one man.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.515
It's unclear to
me why you cannot

30:23.520 --> 30:25.249
Take clarenbach from him.
I'm becoming concerned

30:25.250 --> 30:26.649
For the welfare
of your daughter.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.641
Be quiet.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.548
You need to see this.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.420
I snaked an optical cord

30:35.430 --> 30:37.751
Into the air vent
to monitor them.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.920
(radio static)

30:40.970 --> 30:42.858
What are they listening to?

30:43.870 --> 30:45.758
Us.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.088
(feedback squealing)

31:05.630 --> 31:07.621
All right, now after I go,

31:07.630 --> 31:10.224
You count to 30, and then
you go up to your room.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.458
And you?

31:11.470 --> 31:13.495
(sighs) I'm gonna
get close enough

31:13.500 --> 31:15.695
To one of them to get
the keys and the radio.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.962
And then I'm out the door.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.198
Aaron...

31:18.210 --> 31:20.007
If I get far enough
away from here,

31:20.010 --> 31:21.500
The government
must be listening.

31:21.510 --> 31:23.637
IfI can get a signal out,

31:23.640 --> 31:25.471
I can get you home.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.869
Okay?

31:28.850 --> 31:31.045
(sighs)

31:41.490 --> 31:42.923
I knew I heard something.

31:42.930 --> 31:45.694
Amber, run!

31:45.700 --> 31:46.928
No!

31:46.930 --> 31:49.228
I'll be taking her with me now.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.697
Run! Amber, run!

31:51.710 --> 31:54.235
Go! I'll hold him.
I'll hold him! Go! Go!

31:54.240 --> 31:56.037
(groaning)

31:56.040 --> 31:58.531
Amber, I'll hold him!
Just go!

31:58.550 --> 31:59.903
(screams)

32:03.620 --> 32:05.076
(crying):
Aaron.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.513
Aaron?

32:07.520 --> 32:09.750
(sobbing)

32:17.630 --> 32:20.292
(sobbing):
No.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.083
I'll draw them away.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.285
When I do, you need
to run out that exit.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.451
Don't stop,
don't look back.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.655
Run to where?
Back to the car.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.799
Pd will have responded
to the shooting by then.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.051
What shooting?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.129
The shooting that's
about to start.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.829
Vries:
Agent finley!

32:56.840 --> 32:59.900
We have a problem.

32:59.910 --> 33:03.402
I'm a man that's willing
to kill for my daughter,

33:03.410 --> 33:05.435
And you
as a secret service agent,

33:05.450 --> 33:07.179
Are trained to take a bullet.

33:07.180 --> 33:11.913
I've accepted the fact
that I'm going to prison today.

33:11.920 --> 33:16.983
And I'd like very much
not to have to kill a good man

33:16.990 --> 33:20.153
On my last day of freedom.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.458
I just need clarenbach.

33:22.460 --> 33:25.327
It's the only way
I get my daughter back.

33:25.330 --> 33:30.097
The kidnapper will kill my emma
ifI don't bring him clarenbach.

33:30.100 --> 33:34.036
Please, just give him to me.

33:38.210 --> 33:39.632
You make it back,

33:39.650 --> 33:41.948
You tell those cops
where that mansion is.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.516
Okay, I will.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.148
Jakob, listen to me.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.287
You don't have
to do this.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.281
We know how to get
to the mansion.

33:52.290 --> 33:53.882
We can rescue
all those kids.

33:53.890 --> 33:55.448
Nobody has to get hurt.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.291
Even if you're telling
the truth,

33:57.300 --> 34:00.622
You can't guarantee that I get
my little girl back alive.

34:00.630 --> 34:03.360
The only thing
that guarantees it

34:03.370 --> 34:05.395
Is if I do
what the kidnapper wants.

34:05.410 --> 34:08.402
All he wants is clarenbach.

34:08.410 --> 34:11.402
All I want is emma.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.569
(hushed):
Listen to me.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.639
This is where
the killing starts.

34:15.650 --> 34:17.868
Use lethal force on the agent.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.915
Make sure
you get clarenbach alive.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.047
You want to live,
you need to keep thinking.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.018
You want to keep thinking,
you need to keep breathing.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.258
There will be shooting.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.820
When I start shooting, you run.

34:31.830 --> 34:34.765
Ready?
Ready.

34:34.770 --> 34:36.567
One...

34:37.440 --> 34:39.135
Two...
(machine gun firing)

34:48.510 --> 34:51.411
He said not to kill me.
Why are they shooting at me?

34:51.420 --> 34:53.581
They're not. They're shooting
at the second set of gunmen

34:53.590 --> 34:55.012
That came to get you.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.285
Widener's men.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.493
This is our only chance
to get out.

35:22.150 --> 35:25.278
The parent mission that wasn't
supposed to be a problem?

35:25.290 --> 35:27.884
It's jakob vries.
It's a huge problem.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.256
Then you need to make
that problem go away.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.285
I need clarenbach.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.484
Gotcha.

35:33.490 --> 35:34.821
Come here.

35:34.830 --> 35:38.220
Kill everyone:
Finley, vries, his men.

35:38.230 --> 35:42.462
Everyone except clarenbach.
Widener needs him alive.

35:42.470 --> 35:44.688
(gunfire continues)

35:48.910 --> 35:51.777
(gasps)
what is that?

35:51.780 --> 35:53.998
It's gas.
He's using gas.

35:54.010 --> 35:55.500
(grunts)

35:57.120 --> 35:59.941
I'm sorry, I really am,
but it's my daughter.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.612
No, wait. Wait.
He knows where the mansion is.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.612
No matter what you do to me,
you have to ask him.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.154
(grunts)

36:17.970 --> 36:20.632
You dislocated your thumb
to get out of your cuffs.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.335
Yeah, I guess
all those years

36:22.340 --> 36:24.001
Of hurting myself
finally paid off, huh?

36:25.440 --> 36:26.941
Sorry.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.269
(gasps)

36:28.280 --> 36:29.975
Hey, let's get you
out of here.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.016
What do you mean,
get
me
out of here?

36:32.020 --> 36:34.181
What about you?
Gibson's the target.

36:34.190 --> 36:35.441
That means they're
after him, too.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.654
They could have
information

36:36.660 --> 36:37.809
That could lead us
to amber.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.708
I need to see
if they do.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.857
I can't leave you
here, susie.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.192
For once in your life,
you're not in control.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.156
_ Susie...
You'll just slow me down.

36:46.170 --> 36:48.798
I can't worry about you
with what I have to do.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.028
Come with me.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.632
(door opens)

36:51.640 --> 36:53.096
Damn it. Just stay here.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.575
What's going on here?
Where's the other one?

37:02.580 --> 37:04.275
(yells)

37:07.250 --> 37:08.945
Behind you!

37:12.330 --> 37:13.479
(gasps)

37:13.490 --> 37:15.048
Put the gun down.

37:15.060 --> 37:19.497
I am real tired of you people
telling me what to do.

37:31.910 --> 37:33.798
You've got blood on your face.

37:35.450 --> 37:37.179
It's not mine. Let's go.

38:00.140 --> 38:03.268
Koz:
That's not gonna happen.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.431
Let's get you back up
to your room.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.942
The fbi has now confirmed
that the woman found hanging

38:12.950 --> 38:15.544
Beneath the 15th street bridge
was one of their own,

38:15.560 --> 38:16.959
Special agent keegan.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.655
At the time of her death,

38:18.660 --> 38:20.821
Agent keegan was assigned
to ballard parent, meg fitch.

38:20.830 --> 38:23.424
Sir, agent finley
has been located.

38:23.430 --> 38:25.091
He's safe. We've_sent
agents to bring him in.

38:25.100 --> 38:26.328
What about agent dunn?

38:26.330 --> 38:27.467
She wasn't with him.

38:27.470 --> 38:30.234
Get agent finley on the line.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.629
(phone ringing)

38:36.180 --> 38:37.772
Olsen.

38:37.780 --> 38:41.500
I'm in a building on the corner
of 58th and jackson.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.738
Send a full team.

38:55.660 --> 38:57.321
Emma?

39:04.670 --> 39:05.932
Emma?!

39:05.940 --> 39:08.158
Dad?

39:08.180 --> 39:09.204
Emma!

39:09.210 --> 39:11.508
Dad! Daddy!

39:12.710 --> 39:14.598
(both sob)

39:17.150 --> 39:19.015
Get down!
Get down on the ground.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.840
(guns clicking)
step away, sir.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.117
Emma!

39:24.120 --> 39:25.815
If you're just joining us,

39:25.830 --> 39:29.152
Another ballard student,
emma vries, has been released.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.958
She's the eighth student since
the kidnapping to be released.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.995
The fbi has now confirmed
that the woman found hanging

39:34.000 --> 39:35.365
Beneath the 15th street
bndge".

39:35.370 --> 39:36.689
The fitch girl?

39:36.700 --> 39:38.736
She'll have a story to tell.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.360
Unharmed?

39:41.380 --> 39:43.405
Not a scratch.

39:43.410 --> 39:46.072
_You know how
important she is.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.048
I do.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.814
That teacher must have put up
a hell of a fight.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.970
I didn't think he had it in him.

39:55.720 --> 39:56.709
What about them?

39:56.720 --> 39:59.757
Roll some gas down the vent.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.649
Tuck 'em back in their beds.

40:02.660 --> 40:06.699
There's been enough
punishment for one day.

40:06.700 --> 40:09.521
Authorities won't comment
on what her father may have done

40:09.540 --> 40:11.496
To procure her freedom,

40:11.510 --> 40:15.059
But jakob vries is in
fbi custody at this time.

40:27.350 --> 40:28.783
(grunts)

40:32.960 --> 40:34.188
Francis.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.124
Jonas.

40:36.130 --> 40:37.688
I've been here before.

40:37.700 --> 40:40.168
Yes. We both have.

40:42.870 --> 40:44.098
Now...

40:44.100 --> 40:46.637
Are you ready to get to work?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.708
(indistinct radio transmission)

40:58.720 --> 41:01.917
You saved both of our lives
by pulling the old man away.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.788
Looks like you did
the lifesaving around here.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.554
They killed two fbi agents,

41:08.560 --> 41:11.120
Hung one of their bodies
off a bridge.

41:11.130 --> 41:13.997
Yeah, I know.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.299
And gibson, he got clarenbach?

41:18.470 --> 41:21.166
But I know the direction
the man5ion is in.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.968
It's a tank of gas from here.
We're close, dunn.

41:23.980 --> 41:25.834
Real close.

41:34.350 --> 41:37.717
