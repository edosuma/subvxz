Come down here, please, so we
can check those pearly whites of yours.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.737
Open wide.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.781
Yuck.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.451
Like, not bad,
not bad for a snow beast your age.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.245
But they do need cleaning.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.080
-Toothbrush.
-Toothbrush.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.083
-Toothpaste.
-Toothpaste.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.343
[LAUGHS]

18:55.510 --> 18:58.805
See you in about six months
for a checkup.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.019
Something tells me
we're getting closer to--

19:04.185 --> 19:06.521
MAN:
Help!

19:06.688 --> 19:07.772
What's that?

19:07.939 --> 19:10.608
MAN:
Help!

19:10.775 --> 19:12.652
FRED:
It's coming from in here.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.740
DAPHNE:
The professor and Chief Manook.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.825
Ah. You've found us.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.327
What happened?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.911
| can't remember.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.082
It's all a blank,
after the snow beast took me away.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.793
SHAGGY:
Like, help!

19:28.960 --> 19:30.337
Shaggy, Scooby.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.505
Where have you two been?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.175
Oh, boy. Like, don't ask.

19:35.342 --> 19:39.387
Come on. We've gotta get the professor
and Manook back up to the surface.

19:40.597 --> 19:41.765
DAPHNE:
We made it.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.684
Now, all we have to do
is capture the snow beast.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.270
Heh, heh, heh. Like, is that all?

19:47.687 --> 19:51.900
If someone could just lure the snow
beast onto this patch of slippery ice...

19:52.067 --> 19:53.109
...he'll be helpless.

19:53.276 --> 19:56.029
Any volunteers?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.407
Way to go, Scoob.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.534
[WHIMPERING]

20:13.713 --> 20:15.715
[ROARING]

20:16.716 --> 20:17.759
Yipe.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.849
Like, here they come.

20:39.114 --> 20:42.033
Just as we thought. A hidden oil derrick.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.328
SHAGGY: And the snow beast
was a mechanical monster.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.581
FRED: Run by Baptiste,
the professor's assistant.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.627
Once we put the clues together,
it was really simple.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.671
Baptiste came across the black snow...

20:54.838 --> 20:57.090
...while doing research
for Professor Krueger.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.884
And he realized
there was a huge oil pool there.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.679
And because it was on Eskimo land...

21:02.846 --> 21:06.724
...he took advantage of their legend
about the snow beast to scare them away.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.060
Then he and a driller
from the Alaskan pipeline...

21:09.227 --> 21:11.271
...built the derricks during the night...

21:11.438 --> 21:13.481
...disguised them as totem poles.

21:13.648 --> 21:18.069
And began smuggling oil out beneath
the ice in converted submarines.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.613
Like, the professor became suspicious.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.909
So Baptiste carried him off
with his snow beast and locked him up.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.369
Just like Chief Manook.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.290
And | would have made millions
if it hadn't been for you meddling kids.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.167
We're ready to take off.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.878
-Where's Scooby?
-Like, he's fishing.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.299
| got a bite.

21:43.553 --> 21:46.639
Oh, no.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.656
