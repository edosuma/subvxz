00:02.291 --> 00:05.000
So there I am,
Staples parking lot is full.

00:05.083 --> 00:06.542
I'm talking
zero open spots.

00:06.625 --> 00:09.375
Game over, right?
No graph paper for Stan?

00:09.458 --> 00:11.709
Well, I see a woman
by a minivan.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.583
Is she loading her kid in
or taking him out?

00:13.667 --> 00:16.709
20 minutes later, the person
next to her pulls out,

00:16.792 --> 00:20.500
and that's how I came to find
my parking spot at Staples.

00:21.542 --> 00:24.458
Is it over?
I-Is the story actually over?

00:24.542 --> 00:25.542
Yes.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.458
Okay, then
I have a sick story.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.041
You know that machine gun
I found on the roof?

00:29.125 --> 00:30.458
But with an interesting
addendum.

00:30.542 --> 00:33.709
When I came out of Staples,
the minivan was gone.

00:33.792 --> 00:36.125
Honey, when you say
your story's over,

00:36.208 --> 00:37.917
it's not fair
to keep going.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.208
What's going on?

00:39.291 --> 00:40.834
I take 20 minutes
of my time,

00:40.917 --> 00:43.041
give you a solid-gold
parking-lot story,

00:43.125 --> 00:44.709
and your jaws
aren't on the floor?

00:44.792 --> 00:46.000
Your stories
are boring, Dad.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.083
You're boring.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.875
Ouch.
I get it.

00:48.959 --> 00:50.208
You didn't like
hearing that story,

00:50.291 --> 00:52.417
but you're gonna love
seeing it in pictures.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.625
I actually took a photo
of that parking spot.

00:54.709 --> 00:56.417
You guys are gonna
go bonkers over this.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.583
I can't build this up
enough.

01:00.417 --> 01:01.417
You're in luck.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.041
I must have accidentally
hit the burst mode

01:03.125 --> 01:05.417
and taken thousands
of photos.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.291
You guys hate my stories
this much?

01:14.542 --> 01:16.542
Shh.

01:16.625 --> 01:20.125
But I-I was just getting
to the Shyamalanian twist.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.917
Turns out it was
a CVS parking lot...

01:26.166 --> 01:28.583
...and I wasn't allowed
to park there.

01:32.208 --> 01:34.041
Where did it go?
I can't see it.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.750
I can't see it!

01:35.834 --> 01:37.291
There it is.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.417

Oh, yeah, top notch.

Hey, Stan.
Bullock needs to see you.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.250
And I need to see you.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.834

Sorry, janitor.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.083
Smith.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.542
I'm just getting ready
for my vacation off the coast

02:57.625 --> 03:00.667
on Central America
to Hedonism lll.

03:00.750 --> 03:04.000
Sweet, flying solo

The grippin'

03:08.458 --> 03:10.375
Yeah, yeah,

03:10.458 --> 03:12.291
Get it!

03:12.375 --> 03:15.750
Uh!

03:15.834 --> 03:18.333
Now, I'll need you to do me
a favor while I'm gone.

03:18.417 --> 03:21.583
I need you to teach my class
at the C.I.A. Academy.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.542
Although,
it won't be easy.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.542
My students
are quite fond of me.

03:25.625 --> 03:28.083
They call me
Professor X.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.500
Because you look
exactly like...

03:29.583 --> 03:33.125
Because I'm always trying
to sell them Ecstasy.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.250
Thanks for saving me
an extra-dry hot dog, Chet.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.709
-Get ready.
-Aw, here we come.

03:38.792 --> 03:40.083
-Prepare yourself for greatness.
-Yo, yo, yo.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.208
What's that?

03:41.291 --> 03:43.750
Your style's weak.
Your rhymes are whack.

03:43.834 --> 03:46.208
Only good thing about you
is your sister's rack.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.083
Oh, got him!

03:48.166 --> 03:50.000
Oh, yeah, he did.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.583
-Oh, he brought it.
-Yeah.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.917
You hooked up with my sister,
and I ain't even pissed

03:54.000 --> 03:55.959
'cause that's
my sloppy seconds, bro.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.792
I taught her
how to kiss.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.417
Damn!
Bringing the pain!

04:00.500 --> 04:01.959
-Oh!
-That's hot!

04:02.041 --> 04:03.291
Burned him!

04:03.375 --> 04:05.041
This guy kissed his sister
and thinks he's all manly.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.125
Well, guess what?

04:06.208 --> 04:07.750
I've banged everybody
in my family.

04:07.834 --> 04:10.542
This dragon
is spitting fire!

04:10.625 --> 04:13.542
-Murdered him!
-Bring it, dawg. Bring it.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.542
-It's Juicy Lou.
-The King of Rap!

04:16.625 --> 04:19.125
Sweet! I found a triple-A
battery in my hot dog.

04:19.208 --> 04:22.542
I watched that whole battle, and
one of you really impressed me.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.291
Not you two.
You're terrible.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.000
I'm talking about the fish.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.291
But I didn't hip-hop.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.542
In fact, I was just
about to file

04:30.625 --> 04:32.291
a racially charged
noise complaint.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.875
Oh, you're no rapper,
but you've got what it takes

04:34.959 --> 04:36.375
to be a great hype man.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.667
A what?

04:37.750 --> 04:41.250
Every emcee has a hype man --
someone to cheer them on,

04:41.333 --> 04:43.667
pump up the crowd,
and guess what?

04:43.750 --> 04:46.917
I got a concert
at the Shark's Nest tonight.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.458
Are you...asking
for a ride?

04:49.542 --> 04:51.667
Hell, no!
I got tons of cars.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.208
I'm giving you the opportunity
of a lifetime --

04:54.291 --> 04:56.750
the chance
to be my hype man.

04:56.834 --> 04:59.500
-I'll do it!
-Great.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.583
Now that that's settled,
I actually do need a ride.

05:01.667 --> 05:05.083
I got mad cars,
but I also got mad DUIs.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.458
All we ask
is you do your best

05:10.542 --> 05:12.250
to inspire
our future agents.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.083
I don't know if this
is a good fit for me.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.208
People don't really like
to listen to me talk.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.500
Tell me, Agent Smith,
how old are you?

05:17.583 --> 05:19.250
65? 70?
-I'm 40.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.375
My point is I'm 73,

05:20.458 --> 05:22.000
and I'm the most jacked man
at the academy.

05:22.083 --> 05:24.375
Go ahead, try to fit
your hand around my arm.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.333
Come on, try.
Boom!

05:26.417 --> 05:27.917
How often do you think
I work out?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.500
I don't know, a lot?

05:29.583 --> 05:31.875
The answer is never!
Not a day in my life.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.083
I willed my body
to look like this.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.625
That's how powerful I am.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.875
Never forget that.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.709
Anyway,
this is your class.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.917
Don't let us down.

05:41.959 --> 05:46.458
I can carry those huge bags of
dog food like they're nothing.

05:47.542 --> 05:49.792
Hey, guys, I'm gonna be
teaching your class

05:49.875 --> 05:51.041
for a few days.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.458
Not sure what
I'm supposed to say

05:52.542 --> 05:54.375
or how to make it interesting,

05:54.458 --> 05:56.917
so I'm just gonna pop
in Spy Kids 3D.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.250
For what it's worth,
my favorite character is Juni.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.667
Just to be clear,
how do you spell Juni?

06:02.667 --> 06:05.083
A great and
controversial question.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.083
It appears one way
in the credits

06:07.166 --> 06:08.625
and another on the Wiki page,

06:08.709 --> 06:10.333
of which I am
the sole contributor.

06:10.417 --> 06:13.583
Wait, what are you doing?
-Taking notes.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.166
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.709
I'm just assuming anything
you say could be on the test,

06:17.792 --> 06:19.500
and we need to know.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.333
Um, yes.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.291
Everything I say
is super important.

06:24.375 --> 06:27.041

10:12.166 --> 10:13.834
Yah-aaah!

10:15.083 --> 10:17.834
Klaus, I'm from
Minimum Security Records.

10:17.917 --> 10:21.208
I got to say, you have
a real stage presence.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.542
Yeah, no shit.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.834
Ever thought about going solo
and rapping yourself,

10:24.917 --> 10:27.000
you know, being the guy?

10:27.083 --> 10:29.959
Nice try, clown, but
I'll stop you right there.

10:30.041 --> 10:31.125
I know the stories.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.000
A lot of great hype men
lost it all

10:33.083 --> 10:34.417
because they got greedy.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
Well, not me.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.333
I got a good thing
going with Juicy Lou,

10:37.417 --> 10:39.208
so keep walking,
dickhead.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.333
Had to ask.

10:40.417 --> 10:43.375
Some guys want to be the man
with the money,

10:43.458 --> 10:45.250
the cars,
all them thick

10:45.333 --> 10:46.667
Puerto Rican girls.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.834
Wait, how thick?

10:48.917 --> 10:51.291
Screw Juicy Lou trying
to hold me back.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.917
Lou is washed up.
It's your time, papi.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.667
Thanks, baby.
How you liking them plantains?

10:56.750 --> 11:00.000
They sweet enough?
-Eh, they okay.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.583
Get the
out of here!

11:02.667 --> 11:04.291
All right.
I'm feeling it.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.542
Doobie, lay this down for me.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.625
This track goes out to all
my dawgs holding it down

11:09.709 --> 11:12.041
in East Chimdale, yeah, yeah.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.000
Especially Skeet and Big Calvin
at Route 9 Pep Boys

11:15.083 --> 11:18.875
and Skeet's wife, Janice,
also repping Pep Boys.

11:18.959 --> 11:20.500
2018, y'all.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.041
Ho ho! That's what
I'm talking about!
That was so good.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.750
Makes me want to dance.
Whoo!

11:24.834 --> 11:26.500
Whoa,
this is awesome.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.208
Thanks, Steve.
See you later.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.458
What?

11:29.542 --> 11:31.709
He called me.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.542
He asked me to come down here.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.667
I -- Why?

11:37.166 --> 11:40.333
Is this where we're gonna
do our training jump?

11:40.417 --> 11:42.542
No, this is
the parking lot

11:42.625 --> 11:44.542
from my famous
parking-spot story.

11:44.625 --> 11:45.917
I thought seeing it
from above

11:46.000 --> 11:48.834
could help you cadets see
how insane the whole thing was

11:48.917 --> 11:50.875
and how stupid
my family is.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.333
Is there a way to turn down
the noise on this thing?

11:53.417 --> 11:56.500
The noise is what's
keeping us in the air.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.041
-Dean.
-Professor Smith,

12:06.125 --> 12:07.792
Ms. Weinsteinopolis
is concerned

12:07.875 --> 12:09.333
you aren't teaching
her son anything.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.750
Thank you, sexy dean.
He's a fraud.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.083
I was helping little Demetri

12:13.166 --> 12:15.500
with his C.I.A. flashcards
last night.

12:15.583 --> 12:18.166
What is Professor Smith's
favorite animal?

12:18.250 --> 12:20.291
Spider monkeys rule
forever times infinity.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.917
Oy vey,
or as us Greek people say,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.417
I smell some funky hummus.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.667
What the hell, Smith?
Midterms are in 2 days.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.333
If your students
don't pass,

12:29.417 --> 12:32.375
I will personally use
my 73-year-old pythons

12:32.458 --> 12:34.750
to throw you from
the academy roof!

12:34.834 --> 12:36.917
Can you agree to those terms,
Ms. Weinsteinopolis?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.166
I can. Demetri,
get out of that thing.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.542
You too good for mama's
helicopter rides now?

12:41.625 --> 12:42.709
Mom,
not in front of the...

Get!

12:55.458 --> 12:58.709
Tomorrow is the marksman
section of the midterm.

12:58.792 --> 13:01.500
If only there was some way
to manipulate their bullets

13:01.583 --> 13:02.959
to hit the targets.

13:03.041 --> 13:06.834
Perhaps using the attracting
properties of metals.

Demetri ran away
from home.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.917
I got swept out

everything you know!

17:45.583 --> 17:49.458
Okay, 2 years ago,
Professor Smith went

17:49.542 --> 17:51.792
to a Panera Bread
to use the WiFi

17:51.875 --> 17:54.375
and thought he saw Ray Romano!

17:54.458 --> 17:56.375
We want C.I.A. secrets,

17:56.458 --> 17:59.250
not boring stories about
this Professor Smith!

17:59.333 --> 18:01.291
But that's all I know!

18:01.375 --> 18:04.083
So we're gonna need
something more severe

18:04.166 --> 18:06.625
if we want to get
you to talk, eh?

18:10.709 --> 18:12.208
-Professor Smith!
-Demetri's mom!

18:12.291 --> 18:13.291
My baby!

18:13.375 --> 18:14.959
Look at these
miserable conditions!

18:15.041 --> 18:17.625
Look at your weird body.
Are you all right?

18:17.709 --> 18:19.125
Okay, I did some recon.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.125
This tunnel leads
to a locked grate,

18:21.208 --> 18:22.709
which leads
to our freedom.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.625
Tanner, I need you
to swim down there

18:24.709 --> 18:25.750
and plant this explosive.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.667
Sorry, but why
are you asking him?

18:27.750 --> 18:29.709
Marco was
an Olympic-level swimmer.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.500
He can hold his breath
for 13 minutes.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.250
Are you really an
Olympic-level swimmer, Marco?

18:35.500 --> 18:36.834
Why am I just
learning this now?

18:36.917 --> 18:39.500
Because you never gave us
a chance to talk!

18:39.583 --> 18:40.834
We couldn't ever
get a word in

18:40.917 --> 18:43.166
with all your babbling
about yourself.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.500
You're right.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.500
I was so obsessed with
finally being heard

18:46.583 --> 18:48.583
that I never stopped
to listen.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.208
What matters is
you're here for us now.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.458
So let's get out of...
You see,

18:52.542 --> 18:54.500
I've always had
a hard time being heard,

18:54.583 --> 18:56.041
dating back to
Mrs. Albrecht's class

18:56.125 --> 18:57.166
in the sixth grade.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.709
I always got put into groups
with Gil Sanchez

18:59.792 --> 19:00.959
and Jason Sherman,

19:01.041 --> 19:04.125
and these two were
very loud boys.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.500
I'm losing patience!

19:09.583 --> 19:13.458
Start talking, or you'll
start losing students.

19:13.542 --> 19:14.792
Talking too much
is what got me

19:14.875 --> 19:16.458
into this mess
in the first place.

19:16.542 --> 19:19.834
No, you can't!
He's only 22!

19:19.917 --> 19:21.417
His name is Demetri!

19:21.500 --> 19:23.417
He -- That's all
I know about him.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
I'm a bad mother.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.834
No, mom,
you're a great mother!

19:26.917 --> 19:28.583
-I know!
-Enough!

19:28.667 --> 19:31.083
He dies.

19:31.166 --> 19:34.333
No!

19:39.417 --> 19:40.709
Don't worry, Stan.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.917
I'll keep your tongue safe.

Oh, don't make me laugh.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.458
Professor Smith,
you sacrificed your ability

19:56.542 --> 19:58.667
to talk to save my life.

19:58.750 --> 19:59.834

19:59.917 --> 20:01.333
Doesn't matter.

I should be
thanking you, Smith.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.041
To tell you the truth,
I needed a break.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.500
I'm shooting dust

What a silly afternoon
you had, Hayley.
