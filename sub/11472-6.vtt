a busy week ahead of us.

02:17.604 --> 02:18.739

02:18.772 --> 02:23.009
Everybody must take a shower
after class starting today.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.278
And I'm gonna be checking
for wet hair,

02:25.311 --> 02:26.813
so don't think
you can pull a fast one.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.248
Is Weir allowed
to shower with us?

you're on my team.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.465
Come on, Bill.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.935
They cannot make us
take a shower.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.003
This is school.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.605
They can make us
do anything.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.407
Don't you think
it's kinda weird

02:54.440 --> 02:58.545
that they want us to,
you know... get naked?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.146
It's not
a burlesque show, Sam.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.515
They just want us
to shower.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.750
What are you guys
talking about?

03:03.784 --> 03:05.586
Stop lookin' up my shorts.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.687
Why would we?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.054

03:08.088 --> 03:10.290
Just keep climbing,
Wonder Woman.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.859
There is something
to see.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.128
Well, I'm not
gonna do it.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.730
Why, because you don't
have any pit hair?

03:16.763 --> 03:18.231
I have pit hair.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.233
Besides, I think
it's kinda weird

03:20.266 --> 03:23.203
that you wanna get naked
in front of everybody.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.039
Hey, Schweiber.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.273
You gonna show us
your circumcision

03:27.307 --> 03:28.875
in the showers today?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.511
Yeah. Take a number.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.645
(LAUGHING)

03:32.546 --> 03:35.982
Well, I guess it is
kinda weird.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.518
All right.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.952
Then that's settled.
We're not doing it.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.588
I can't go up
any farther, guys.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.558
How do I get back down?

03:46.593 --> 03:47.561
Hi, everybody.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.596
If you're just a boy or girl
who can't say no...

03:49.630 --> 03:51.097
Then you won't be
able to say no

It's a great show.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.123
Wow. You'd look good
in that dress.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.191

rehearse today?

04:19.626 --> 04:21.161

have a name?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.451
No, we don't
have a name.

I like that name.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.323

No. I gotta do something
with Kim at 3:00.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.862
Ah. How about 3:01?

04:55.896 --> 04:59.299

use a shower.

even sweat.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.171
Smell us.

05:38.204 --> 05:39.272
Uh, you know, Weir,

05:39.305 --> 05:40.674
I'll put that
on my "to do" list.

and I have an algebra test
that I cannot make up.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.384
And I can't be late
for class.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.787
Just go to class.

05:53.820 --> 05:54.655
All right. Go...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.557

get in the shower.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.825

needed a name

07:15.869 --> 07:18.104
that not only said
who you were,

07:18.138 --> 07:21.374
but what you want to
represent to the audience.

get a bunch of free crap.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.752

buy a pop, man,

get caught.

just wait for me?

you wouldn't
keep doing this.

to look at the clock.

killing me here.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.622
You're pushing me, Nick.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.992
I want your drums
out of the basement.

09:19.025 --> 09:22.228
Dad, you already made me move
the drums out of the garage.

09:23.429 --> 09:24.698
Where am I supposed
to put them

09:24.731 --> 09:26.533
if I can't keep them
in the basement?

09:26.567 --> 09:28.802

with your friends,

09:28.835 --> 09:31.738
why don't you try practicing
at keeping your grades up?

a C+ average.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.945
You know our deal.

09:39.513 --> 09:40.547
Dad, I really...

09:40.581 --> 09:41.782
I don't wanna
join the army, okay?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.817
I'm not cut out
for the army.

09:43.850 --> 09:47.588
C+. It's not too much
to ask for, Nick.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.155
I'm studying
as hard as I can.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.791
Maybe I'm not smart enough
or something,

09:50.824 --> 09:52.292
but I'm doing
the best that I can.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.294
You're not working
hard enough, Nick.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.699
Yes, sir.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.038
Dad?

10:05.071 --> 10:07.708
I really think that I can
make it as a drummer.

10:07.741 --> 10:12.378
Nick, I really thought
that I could walk on the moon,

10:12.412 --> 10:15.882
but you just don't see any
moon rocks around here, do ya?

10:17.483 --> 10:19.252
Thanks for the talk, Dad.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.703
You mom cans
her own vegetables?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.772
Yeah.

10:40.541 --> 10:44.711
Aaahhh!

10:47.648 --> 10:49.015
(SIGHS)

10:50.050 --> 10:51.217
Are you okay?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.253
Yeah.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.323
Look, why don't you go...

10:58.625 --> 11:00.861
Why don't you go meet up
with those other guys?

11:02.395 --> 11:03.897
Yeah, okay.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.305
Look, Nick, I couldn't help
overhearing.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.140
And I know maybe
it's none of my business,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.176
but you're the one who told me
when I first met you

11:16.209 --> 11:17.944
that your drums are
your reason for living,

11:17.978 --> 11:20.480
and I don't think
you should let anyone
talk you out of that.

11:20.514 --> 11:24.017
You just need to stick with it
and prove everybody wrong.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.687
Is that really
what you think?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.121
Absolutely.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.692
You can do whatever you want
if you believe in yourself.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.764
No one's ever said that
to me before.

11:38.599 --> 11:40.100
Well, it's true.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.705
Thank you.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.373
Lindsay...

11:47.407 --> 11:49.776
you're like the only person

11:49.810 --> 11:52.779
who's ever gotten
what I'm about.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.480
Yeah, well, we're not
that different...

11:55.816 --> 11:58.318
Except you're gonna be
a famous drummer.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.191
Do you wanna come with me
to meet up with those guys?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.127
Yeah.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.162
All right. Let's go.

12:09.195 --> 12:12.398
I should probably
change out of
these shorts first.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.434
I think they look good.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.769
It's just a lot easier for me

12:15.802 --> 12:18.104
to drum without
fabric on my thighs.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.373
(WHISTLE)

12:20.406 --> 12:23.043

doesn't look like the earth.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.410
Whoa!

12:27.213 --> 12:30.183
That's it.
I'm gonna die
in gym class.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.119

hit the shower.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.490
Come on, that's it.
Good job.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.892
Good job today.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.431
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.534
My hands are filthy.

12:47.568 --> 12:51.137
Yeah, and I can't
say no to a long,
luxurious shower.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.006
No! You can't!

12:54.808 --> 12:55.909
You're on your own.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.111
I'm farshtinkiner,
and I'm showering.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.180
Oh, come on.
Just one more day.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.248
Would you quit being
such a baby?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.183
Just close your eyes,

13:03.216 --> 13:05.085
and it'll be over
before you know it.

13:06.587 --> 13:07.821
I'm with him.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.856
Oh, thanks!

13:10.490 --> 13:11.725
You know?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.059
Friends.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.798
Hey, Sam.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.301
Are, uh...
Are you taking French
next year?

13:24.605 --> 13:26.006
Uh...

13:26.740 --> 13:27.974
I don't know.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.410
I'm thinking of taking German,
since I'm 1/4 German.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.316
C... Could you put on
a towel?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.118
Why?

13:38.484 --> 13:39.786
Well...

13:39.820 --> 13:41.021
'Cause you're naked?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.024
Sam, our bodies
are merely a shell

13:44.057 --> 13:46.059
which conceal
our heavenly souls.

too uptight.

When did you get
chest hair?

13:57.871 --> 13:59.573
What?
I have chest ha...

13:59.606 --> 14:01.808
Oh! Would you look at that?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.944
It'll slow you down
in the pool.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.179
So, you guys
are gonna do it.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.614
I mean...

14:07.648 --> 14:09.282
you're gonna
take a shower.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.484
It's just water.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.619
What could
happen?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.623
Well, you could stop
smelling like my butt,
for one.

gonna bring some cologne.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.929

Nail the geeks!

14:25.298 --> 14:27.534
Stop! Oww! My...

14:27.568 --> 14:28.769
Stop it!
Stop, guys, come on!

14:28.802 --> 14:30.003
Aah!

14:30.871 --> 14:33.373
Ohh!
Stop it! Stop!

14:33.740 --> 14:34.775
Oww!

14:34.808 --> 14:36.142
I hope I can
still have kids.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.310
Come on. You got hit
in the groin.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.179
You didn't have
a hysterectomy.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.548
Oww!
Oh, my God!

14:49.155 --> 14:51.658
Weir, what are you doing?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.294
Look at that
head of hair, huh?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.697
You just get that cut?
That is very stylish

14:56.730 --> 14:59.265
and very, very dry.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.301
Come on. I'm not
going through this again.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.436
Off with the clothes
and into the shower.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.505
No.

15:04.538 --> 15:05.539
What?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.008
I mean...

15:10.744 --> 15:12.713
I don't feel too well.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.615
You don't feel well.

15:14.648 --> 15:15.782
You think I'm new?

15:15.816 --> 15:17.784
Don't pull the fake
sick crap on me. Come on.

a headache,

to the nurse's office.

15:32.666 --> 15:33.934
Schweiber,
put on some clothes.

a 50‐year‐old man.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.107
Hey.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.810
Hey, I thought you guys
were practicing today.

15:43.844 --> 15:46.847
Yeah. I don't know
if those guys are
coming or not. Um...

15:46.880 --> 15:49.049
They went down
to the junkyard

15:49.082 --> 15:51.317
to get a carburetor
for Kim's gremlin.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.153
Yeah, it might
take awhile.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.022
What?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.457
No. I just...

15:58.992 --> 16:01.361
I think you guys
need to rehearse more.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.198
I thought that you said
that we were good.

16:05.231 --> 16:09.002
Yeah, but you guys
aren't good enough
to win any competitions.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.671
Thanks a lot, you know?

16:10.704 --> 16:12.205
Thanks a lot, Lindsay.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.373
No. I...

16:14.340 --> 16:16.476
Well, I mean,
it's true, Nick.

16:16.510 --> 16:18.211
If you wanna
prove your dad wrong,

16:18.244 --> 16:21.447
then the band
has to be really great,

16:22.949 --> 16:25.485
or else he's gonna
send you to the army.

16:26.452 --> 16:27.487
I know.

16:27.521 --> 16:28.989
I know.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.325
You just need to work harder.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.929
You think so?

16:35.962 --> 16:37.097
Uh‐huh.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.265
Yeah. When I was
in The Mathletes,

16:39.299 --> 16:42.302
we did logarithms until
we couldn't see straight.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.070
You know,
but it paid off.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.139
We were state champions,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.542
and we went to nationals
two years in a row.

16:50.644 --> 16:51.712
Yeah.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.414
I don't know. Daniel isn't
really into practicing.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.049
Well, who's the leader
of this band?

16:56.082 --> 16:57.483
You or Daniel?

17:03.023 --> 17:06.259

It's smokin'. It's so hot!

Sunshine of Your Loveagain.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.396
Well, we just
played it, man.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.766
Why would we
do it again?

17:45.799 --> 17:48.134
'Cause it wasn't, uh...
It wasn't right, man.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.402
It was really sloppy,

17:49.435 --> 17:51.638
and it didn't really sound
anything like the record.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.241

sounds like, okay?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.310

we play it.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.618

the song right, you know?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.153

is the right way.

battle of the bands, Daniel.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.225
I could give a crap
about battle of the bands!

18:13.860 --> 18:15.195
Who cares?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.569
You were right, Lindsay.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.708
Right about what?

18:30.476 --> 18:32.478
Please. Do tell.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.284
That you guys don't care,
you know?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.588
Look, maybe you guys
are just screwin' around,

18:41.622 --> 18:45.391
but I... I want us
to be good, you know?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.360
I'm tired of sucking
at everything in my life,

18:47.393 --> 18:50.430
and I wanna nail
that audition, all right?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.832
But we're not gonna
nail that audition

18:51.865 --> 18:54.801
unless we play the songs
over and over and over again

18:54.835 --> 18:56.903
until they're perfect.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.038
All right, Daniel?

18:58.071 --> 19:00.641
So can we just play the song
right once?

19:01.575 --> 19:02.643
Please?

19:05.178 --> 19:06.613
All right?

19:14.287 --> 19:16.056
Let's play
the stupid song.

You are a dumb‐ass,
Andopolis!

20:53.887 --> 20:56.156
Rock 'n' roll
don't come from your brain.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.558
It comes from your crotch.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.893
And if you ever got any,
Mr. Cute Shorts,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.061
you'd know that.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.128
Let's get out of here.

21:02.162 --> 21:03.263
I quit.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.330
NICK: Fine!

21:04.364 --> 21:06.166
I guess that means I quit.

21:06.199 --> 21:07.500
Fine! Quit!

21:08.969 --> 21:11.805
You're not even good enough
to be in Creation!

21:18.945 --> 21:20.313
Thanks a lot, Lindsay.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.390
NEAL: I don't get it.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.058
What do they have
that we don't?

21:32.693 --> 21:34.460
Good bodies.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.030
So he can throw her
over his shoulder.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.332
Big deal.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.635
BILL: He should
use his legs more.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.403
He's gonna throw out
his back.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.438
I don't know.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.340
I mean, my mom says that
women prefer guys with

21:47.373 --> 21:49.375
a good sense of humor.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.277
But you're not
very funny.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.079
Screw you!
I'm hilarious.

21:54.114 --> 21:55.616
Ooh, how witty.

21:55.649 --> 21:57.951
Get this guy on
<i>Hollywood Squares.</i>

21:59.520 --> 22:01.454
I overheard
that Todd Schellinger

22:01.487 --> 22:03.557
takes off his shirt
when he makes out.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.892
Why would he do that?

22:05.926 --> 22:07.293
Why would anybody
do that?

22:07.327 --> 22:09.295
Probably to show off
his chest hair.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.897
I know that's
what I'm gonna do.

22:10.931 --> 22:12.332
(SNICKERS)

22:13.266 --> 22:15.235
Go ahead, laugh,

22:15.268 --> 22:17.838
but all cool guys
have hairy chests:

22:19.005 --> 22:22.308
Selleck, Reynolds,
Rockford.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.010
Hey, what about Mork?

22:24.044 --> 22:27.380
He's got more hair on his hand
than Sam has in his pits.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.382
Ha ha ha!
Shut up!

22:34.555 --> 22:36.657
Will girls ever like us?

22:38.224 --> 22:40.727
I think our best play
is to go for

22:40.761 --> 22:43.530
the smart,
sexy librarian type.

22:43.564 --> 22:45.732
You know,
she's sweet and shy,

22:45.766 --> 22:48.835
but then she takes off
her glasses and rrrowf!

22:48.869 --> 22:49.903
Ha ha ha!

22:49.936 --> 22:52.773
Like Bailey on
<i>WKRP in Cincinnati.</i>

22:52.806 --> 22:53.774
Yup.

22:53.807 --> 22:57.511
But Cindy Sanders
is like a librarian type.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.714
Yeah. Librarian for
the Playboy Mansion.

23:02.282 --> 23:04.651
This push‐up's
too hard to push up.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.989
Ohhh!

23:09.022 --> 23:10.290
Oh, man!

23:10.323 --> 23:11.658
Gross!

23:12.458 --> 23:14.494
Oh, you're sick.

23:16.329 --> 23:17.964
Oh, my God.
It's cold.

23:32.979 --> 23:33.980
Hey.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.485
So, where is everybody?

23:41.722 --> 23:42.789
No idea.

23:43.557 --> 23:45.091
Well, that's kinda weird,
isn't it?

23:46.426 --> 23:47.694
I mean, that no one
is around...

23:47.728 --> 23:51.431
Not that you don't have
any idea where anyone is.

23:56.069 --> 23:57.538
I'm gonna go.

23:58.338 --> 24:00.440
Hey, Lindsay.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.142
Thanks for
breaking up the band.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.276
What?

24:03.309 --> 24:05.045
(MOCKINGLY)
What?

24:05.078 --> 24:06.479
I didn't break up the band.

24:06.513 --> 24:10.116
I just thought you guys
should learn one song.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.685
So, you admit it.

24:11.718 --> 24:14.387
Yes, I admit it.
I...

24:14.420 --> 24:16.623
God! How could I be
so awful to suggest

24:16.657 --> 24:19.425
that you actually play
an entire song correctly

24:19.459 --> 24:21.227
all the way through?

24:21.261 --> 24:24.531
God knows Zeppelin only plays
half of <i>Stairway to Heaven,</i>

24:24.565 --> 24:28.669
and The Who never even
practices <i>Teenage Wasteland.</i>

24:29.369 --> 24:30.837
Baba O'Riley.

24:31.672 --> 24:32.673
What?

24:36.677 --> 24:39.813
The name of the song
is <i>Baba O'Riley.</i>

24:41.081 --> 24:42.716
It's on <i>Who's Next?</i>

24:56.997 --> 24:58.632
You know I didn't
break up the band.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.301
I just wanted
to help Nick.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.603
Nick doesn't need
any help.

25:02.636 --> 25:03.770
How can you say that?

25:03.804 --> 25:05.238
If he doesn't make it
as a drummer,

25:05.271 --> 25:07.273
he has to go
into the army.

25:07.307 --> 25:08.809
What?

25:08.842 --> 25:11.678
He's not gonna make it
as a drummer.

25:11.712 --> 25:13.346
So why don't you just
let him have some fun

25:13.379 --> 25:14.948
before he has to ship off?

25:14.981 --> 25:17.851
Yeah? Well, you sound
just like his dad.

25:18.552 --> 25:20.987
Maybe his dad is right.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.923
I can't believe
you're saying that.

25:25.125 --> 25:28.629
Lindsay, he's not gonna be
the next Keith Moon.

25:28.662 --> 25:31.031
So if he's got someplace to go
that's gonna take care of him,

25:31.064 --> 25:32.899
why don't you just stay
out of his way?

25:32.933 --> 25:35.268
Daniel, that is not
how it has to be.

25:36.136 --> 25:38.705
Oh... Okay.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.576
(BELL RINGS)

25:48.081 --> 25:49.282
Schweiber.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.450
Here.

25:50.483 --> 25:51.518
Trinsky.

25:51.552 --> 25:52.753
<i>Ich bin hier.</i>

25:53.854 --> 25:54.855
Weir.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.757
Weir!

25:58.424 --> 25:59.793
Anybody seen Weir?

26:01.027 --> 26:02.028
Weir!

26:02.696 --> 26:03.830
MARK: Yeah, man,
and this kid,

26:03.864 --> 26:07.100
he was, like,
"Red‐rum! Red‐rum!"

26:08.134 --> 26:11.572
Forget it, man,
red‐rum's murder backwards.

26:11.605 --> 26:13.206
Hey! Come on. This ain't tea
with the queen.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.475
You leave now, you're still
10 minutes late to class.

26:15.509 --> 26:16.877
Come on, let's go.

26:17.611 --> 26:18.645
Red‐rum...

26:18.679 --> 26:20.614
Aw, get out of here,
you nut!

26:26.987 --> 26:28.021
(SPLASH)

26:29.022 --> 26:30.190
Who's there?

26:30.223 --> 26:31.257
(SHOE SQUEAKS)

26:31.291 --> 26:32.826
Who's in there?

26:38.565 --> 26:40.534
Hey, you know
it's a little easier

26:40.567 --> 26:42.803
if you sit down
and drop your pants.

26:47.541 --> 26:48.742
Hey!

26:50.577 --> 26:51.778
Hey.

26:53.246 --> 26:56.216
So, uh, how come
you weren't in English today?

26:58.051 --> 26:59.653
I bailed.

26:59.686 --> 27:02.488
The, uh, whole band
breaking up thing

27:02.523 --> 27:04.891
has gotten me really down.
You know?

27:04.925 --> 27:07.260
Yeah, well,
it shouldn't.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.494
And it wasn't
a real band.

27:08.529 --> 27:09.730
Those guys were just
screwing around.

27:09.763 --> 27:11.898
You're the only one
trying to be a professional.

27:13.266 --> 27:14.935
Yeah.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.938
I still don't have a band,
uh, you know?

27:19.573 --> 27:22.676
Well, maybe you
could join this one.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.211
What are you talking about?

27:29.249 --> 27:31.718
Dimension's looking
for a new drummer?!

27:31.752 --> 27:33.153
Yeah. I was up
at the record store.

27:33.186 --> 27:36.356
These guys are like the top
working ban in Detroit!

27:36.389 --> 27:39.359
I saw them
open for Jethro Tull
at Cobo Hall last year.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.827
Tull could barely follow them.

27:41.194 --> 27:42.395
Oh, man!

27:42.428 --> 27:45.331
You could be getting paid
to drum, like a real job.

27:46.366 --> 27:48.501
Oh, hell, yeah!

27:48.535 --> 27:50.103
Oh, man, I gotta go
call these guys

27:50.136 --> 27:52.939
and set up an audition.
And then I gotta go practice.

27:52.973 --> 27:55.408
It's not...
It's not 5:00 yet, is it?

27:55.441 --> 27:56.476
Mm‐mm.

27:56.510 --> 27:57.878
Yeah!

27:58.211 --> 27:59.345
Oh!

28:03.617 --> 28:05.051
Thank you.

28:05.085 --> 28:06.319
You're welcome.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.956
I don't want to get naked
in front of other guys.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.392
Well, who does?

28:12.425 --> 28:15.228
You know how many men
have seen me naked
in my lifetime?

28:15.696 --> 28:16.997
A lot.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.132
Do you think I'm
comfortable with it?

28:19.700 --> 28:21.467
No, but I live with it.

28:22.636 --> 28:24.470
I just don't want them
to tease me.

28:24.505 --> 28:26.206
Oh, who would tease you?

28:26.239 --> 28:28.975
All right, look,
here's what you do.

28:29.009 --> 28:32.112
You tell them
you're proud of your body.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.514
That'll show 'em.

28:33.547 --> 28:38.619
Sam... you have
a beautiful body.

28:38.652 --> 28:40.086
Doesn't he, Harold?

28:41.154 --> 28:43.824
Yes. I just said
he had a beautiful body.

28:43.857 --> 28:46.059
Those other boys are
probably just jealous.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.029
Lindsay, tell your brother
what a beautiful body he has.

28:49.530 --> 28:50.964
Mom!
Mom!

28:50.997 --> 28:53.534
HAROLD: Lindsay.
What?

28:53.567 --> 28:55.068
Your mother asked you
to tell your brother

28:55.101 --> 28:56.469
that he has
a beautiful body.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.839
That is so stupid.

28:58.872 --> 29:00.707
Lindsay, tell him.

29:00.741 --> 29:01.908
It's not gonna help him.

29:01.942 --> 29:04.477
Lindsay,
just say the words.

29:04.511 --> 29:06.112
It'll make him
feel better.

29:09.049 --> 29:10.150
Sam...

29:10.817 --> 29:12.953
you have a beautiful body.

29:12.986 --> 29:16.623
You're an Adonis,
a slab of beef...

29:16.657 --> 29:18.725
If I wasn't your sister,

29:18.759 --> 29:20.260
oh, my God...

29:20.293 --> 29:21.461
Lindsay! Can it.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.864
See, sweetheart?

29:49.255 --> 29:50.323
SCOTT: Wow!

29:50.356 --> 29:53.026
That was great, Paul.
We'll be in touch.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.962
I never played on a drum kit
this small before.

29:57.430 --> 29:59.332
I'm sure I'll be fine.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.500
Hey, you Nick?

30:01.702 --> 30:02.969
Yeah.

30:07.107 --> 30:09.142
Hey, I'm Scott.
Hello, Scott.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.611
That's Alex,
and that's Vance.

30:10.644 --> 30:12.345
Hey, Alex.
Hello, Vance.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.280
VANCE: How's it goin', man?
NICK: Great.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.517
I hope this kit's okay
with you.

30:16.550 --> 30:18.251
Oh, yeah.
No, it's fine.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.587
The one I normally play on
is a lot bigger.

30:20.621 --> 30:22.155
Oh, wow, really?
How many pieces?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.223
Twenty‐nine.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.658
Whoa!

30:24.691 --> 30:26.126
Twenty‐nine‐piece kit.

30:26.159 --> 30:28.862
Wow, what are you doing here?
You should be auditioning us.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.397
Pshhh! Yeah, right.
Right?

30:31.431 --> 30:34.935
Ha ha. I saw you guys
open for Jethro Tull

30:34.968 --> 30:36.570
at Cobo Hall last year.

30:36.603 --> 30:38.471
You guys blew them away.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.973
Well, you must've been
there Friday night,

30:40.006 --> 30:41.575
'cause Saturday night
we got booed off the stage.

30:41.608 --> 30:43.510
We didn't get booed
off the stage.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.478
(LAUGHS)

30:45.512 --> 30:47.514
So what do you say?
You wanna jam or what?

30:48.515 --> 30:49.850
Yeah!
Cool.

30:49.883 --> 30:52.052
Let's rock it, man.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.086
Cool.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.689
You call the tune.

30:55.722 --> 30:57.758
Uh... How about
a little Cream?

30:57.791 --> 30:59.593
Yeah, let's do <i>Crossroads.</i>

30:59.626 --> 31:02.929
What do you, uh, what about
<i>Sunshine Of Your Love?</i>

31:02.963 --> 31:04.931
I hate that song.
Let's do <i>Crossroads.</i>

31:04.965 --> 31:06.399
We do it live.

31:07.968 --> 31:09.002
No problem.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.004
All right.
Count it off, my man.

31:14.641 --> 31:15.642
NICK: All right.

31:16.577 --> 31:17.578
Yeah.

31:33.026 --> 31:35.495
That's good, but let's
try it a little bit tighter.

31:35.529 --> 31:36.563
Tighter?

31:36.597 --> 31:37.931
Yeah.
All right. Let's do it.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.566
Count it off.
Right.

31:51.712 --> 31:54.147
Hold it.
Hold it.

31:54.180 --> 31:58.084
Hold on. Let's try it
just a little bit
quicker pace.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.887
Oh, quicker pace.

32:00.921 --> 32:03.123
Yeah.
Okay. Cool.

32:07.728 --> 32:09.495
Sorry 'bout that.
Ready?

32:09.530 --> 32:10.597
All right,
here we go.

32:10.631 --> 32:11.998
Count it off.

Cool. Thanks a lot.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.450
What do you mean?
That's it?

33:04.484 --> 33:05.519
Well, that's it?

33:05.552 --> 33:07.754
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

33:07.788 --> 33:09.222
I... I, uh...

33:09.255 --> 33:11.725
Hey, uh, good luck with
that 29‐piecer, man.

33:11.758 --> 33:14.528
Maybe someday, you'll knock
it up to an even 30.

33:16.663 --> 33:17.664
Thanks.

33:32.245 --> 33:34.314
So, what are you
gonna do now?

33:36.082 --> 33:38.018
Join the army,
I guess.

33:39.786 --> 33:42.455
No. I mean...
Right now.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.791
Do you want to go
to the record store
or anything?

33:44.825 --> 33:46.392
I suck, Lindsay.

33:46.426 --> 33:47.561
No, you don't.

33:50.531 --> 33:52.398
You were in there
with me, right?

33:53.133 --> 33:55.101
You... You heard me playing?

33:56.069 --> 33:57.538
I was a joke.

33:58.905 --> 34:03.443
You know, Nick, those guys
are 5 years older than you.

34:03.476 --> 34:06.246
And in 5 years,
you're gonna be
way better than they are.

34:08.582 --> 34:09.716
No, I'm not.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.889
Sometimes I go down
in my basement,

34:15.922 --> 34:18.024
and I put on a live album,

34:18.058 --> 34:21.361
I can...
See myself on the stage.

34:21.394 --> 34:23.429
Do you understand
what I mean? I can see it.

34:23.463 --> 34:24.798
And I'm playing
a 10‐minute solo,

34:24.831 --> 34:27.968
and I'm on one of those
hydraulic risers, you know,

34:28.001 --> 34:30.070
that make the drum kit
go way up high.

34:30.103 --> 34:32.506
I'm Peter Criss or something.

34:35.375 --> 34:36.577
Oh, man...

34:41.114 --> 34:43.283
I'm not gonna be that guy.

34:43.316 --> 34:45.085
I'm never gonna be
that guy.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.089
I'll be lucky if I
get to be the guy

34:49.122 --> 34:51.091
who pushes the button
and makes the riser go up,

34:51.124 --> 34:53.193
but I'm not even gonna be
that guy.

34:53.994 --> 34:55.161
I'm not even gonna be
that guy

34:55.195 --> 34:58.398
'cause I can't
even keep a C+ average, man.

34:58.431 --> 35:02.536
Oh, Nick, I could...
I can help you
get your grades up.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.371
He's gonna make me
join the army.

35:06.406 --> 35:09.242
Oh, man, I'm gonna have
to join the army.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.411
I'm gonna be surrounded
by a group of psychopaths

35:11.444 --> 35:14.715
like my brothers
and like my dad.

35:14.748 --> 35:17.784
Nick, come on.

35:18.552 --> 35:20.486
That's not gonna
happen to you.

35:21.688 --> 35:22.956
I won't let it.

35:22.989 --> 35:24.390
Oh, my God.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.794
I'm done, man.

35:29.630 --> 35:30.631
I'm done.

NEAL: What is wrong
with them?

36:56.282 --> 36:58.218
Why do they think
that hitting people

36:58.251 --> 36:59.753
with towels is so funny?

37:00.687 --> 37:02.556
If it wasn't us...

37:02.589 --> 37:05.358
Ha ha ha...
It would be kinda funny.

37:06.226 --> 37:07.728
BOY: Afternoon,
gentlemen.

37:10.096 --> 37:12.498
Hey, have you lost weight?

37:13.967 --> 37:15.368
Shut up!

37:17.237 --> 37:18.939
Get out of my way.

37:18.972 --> 37:20.874
I'm gonna take
a shower.

37:24.545 --> 37:27.447
Look who finally decided
to take a shower.

37:28.148 --> 37:30.116
Nice pecs, Weir.

37:30.150 --> 37:32.586
You look like
a flat‐chested girl.

37:32.619 --> 37:34.521
Ha ha!
Flat‐chested girl.

37:35.922 --> 37:38.024
Well, I'm proud
of my body.

37:38.058 --> 37:40.761
(MOCKINGLY)
oh, he's proud of his body.

37:40.794 --> 37:42.929
Oh, he should be proud.
Look at this.

37:42.963 --> 37:44.030
Get out of my way.

37:44.064 --> 37:46.099
Maybe you should show it
to everybody then, huh, Weir?

37:46.132 --> 37:48.368
What are you doing?

37:48.401 --> 37:51.505
Come on, guys.
Guys, don't...

37:51.538 --> 37:53.439
I wouldn't want you
to miss class.

37:56.843 --> 37:57.878
Oh, come on!

37:57.911 --> 37:59.946
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

37:59.980 --> 38:02.415
Let me in!
Mr. Fredricks!

38:02.448 --> 38:04.785
So, uh, how long
have you been teaching?

38:04.818 --> 38:05.852
2 months.

38:05.886 --> 38:07.654
2 months?
Do you like it?

38:07.688 --> 38:09.422
I love it.
I love it, too.

38:09.890 --> 38:11.224
Mr. Fredricks!

38:11.257 --> 38:13.059
Oh, I'm sorry, Weir.

38:14.194 --> 38:15.696
I forgot to take that!

38:18.131 --> 38:19.165
God!

38:19.199 --> 38:20.834
(BULLIES LAUGH)

38:28.441 --> 38:29.976
Got some shorts
in my locker.

38:35.281 --> 38:37.651
(BELL RINGS)

38:37.684 --> 38:39.553
(GASPS)

38:46.059 --> 38:47.060
Why...

38:51.331 --> 38:52.799
Sam, Alan's gone.

38:52.833 --> 38:55.401
All clear,
you can come back now.

38:58.739 --> 39:00.340
Hey, Lindsay.

39:00.807 --> 39:02.676
Hi.
Hey.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.911
Can I talk to you
for a second?

39:05.378 --> 39:06.980
Yeah. Sure.

39:07.013 --> 39:08.448
Come on.

39:12.919 --> 39:14.087
Streaker!

39:14.120 --> 39:15.622
Go, Sam! Go!

39:36.510 --> 39:37.544
Where you from?

39:37.578 --> 39:38.612
I'm from right here.

39:38.645 --> 39:40.213
I actually live
down the street.

39:40.246 --> 39:41.347
You're from
right here?

39:41.381 --> 39:42.649
Yeah.
Oh, my...

39:44.985 --> 39:47.387
Yeah, right.
You know...

39:48.054 --> 39:49.055
Oh, Jesus.

39:52.926 --> 39:56.062
Well, what the hell
are you looking at?

39:57.263 --> 40:00.000
Weir...
The shower's that way.

40:04.237 --> 40:05.506
I just wanted you to know

40:05.539 --> 40:07.674
I can't stop thinking
about that kiss.

40:08.141 --> 40:09.676
Oh, good.

40:12.045 --> 40:13.914
It really meant a lot to me.

40:14.881 --> 40:16.082
I'm glad.

40:18.652 --> 40:20.587
Let's go out to the patio.

40:20.987 --> 40:21.955
Patio?

40:21.988 --> 40:23.624
I thought you were fighting
with those guys.

40:23.657 --> 40:25.659
Yeah, we were,
but not anymore.

40:25.692 --> 40:28.061
We fight like that
all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.

40:28.094 --> 40:29.262
Oh...

40:29.295 --> 40:30.831
They heard what happened
at the audition.

40:30.864 --> 40:32.599
They came over last night,
we're cool.

40:33.867 --> 40:35.802
KIM: You know, you guys,
I'm serious.

40:35.836 --> 40:37.137
I think my mom, like,
wants to come

40:37.170 --> 40:38.639
see the band
play or something.

40:38.672 --> 40:40.173
When she gets
out of rehab?

40:40.206 --> 40:41.842
Oh, ho ho.
Shut up.

40:42.543 --> 40:45.045
Yah!
Yay!

40:45.078 --> 40:46.613
Ringo Starr.

40:46.647 --> 40:48.782
You finally got
your wish, Nick.

40:48.815 --> 40:51.084
You're as good a drummer
as John Bonham.

40:51.117 --> 40:52.218
Of course he's dead.

40:52.252 --> 40:53.887
(LAUGHTER)

40:53.920 --> 40:56.056
You should've seen the looks
on those guys' faces, man.

40:56.089 --> 40:58.892
I think I ruined their love
of music forever.

41:01.528 --> 41:02.963
Hey, is Dimension
gonna charge you

41:02.996 --> 41:05.031
for the pee stain you
left on the drum seat?

41:05.065 --> 41:06.299
Shut up.

41:06.332 --> 41:08.501
Look, Dimension sucks, man.

41:08.535 --> 41:10.571
You're too good for them.
I saw them open for Tull,

41:10.604 --> 41:12.172
they got booed off the stage.

41:13.173 --> 41:14.641
Thanks a lot, man.

41:16.643 --> 41:20.113
(MOUTHING)
hey Lindsay, we have to talk.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.782
DANIEL: So are we gonna
rehearse at your place today,

41:21.815 --> 41:22.849
or is the old man
gonna pop a vein?

41:22.883 --> 41:24.785
(MOUTHING)
you are such a slut.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.486
NICK: No. It's cool.
We just gotta be out by 5:00.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.454
DANIEL: Hey, let's play some
real songs for once.

41:28.488 --> 41:30.557
I wrote out some Iggy Pop
and Ramones songs.

41:30.591 --> 41:31.892
The Ramones?

41:31.925 --> 41:34.460
The Ramones only play,
like, 3 chords.

41:34.494 --> 41:36.262
All right, so I'll
learn another one.

41:36.296 --> 41:38.431
I gotta pee.

41:38.464 --> 41:41.467
I heard that you jumped him.
What?

41:41.501 --> 41:42.603
You don't have to
act innocent, Lindsay,

41:42.636 --> 41:44.070
I know you're a slut.

41:45.706 --> 41:47.808
NEAL: I'm pretty sure
Cindy didn't see you.

41:47.841 --> 41:51.444
And if she did, it was just
with her peripheral vision.

41:51.477 --> 41:53.747
Hey, it wouldn't be bad
if people saw my back.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.182
But my front's
a whole other story, you know?

41:57.918 --> 42:00.486
Maybe I could transfer
to another school.

42:00.521 --> 42:02.656
Well, well, well.

42:04.490 --> 42:07.260
Hey, Weir, that was fun
in gym class today, huh?

42:08.028 --> 42:09.429
Leave me alone.

42:09.462 --> 42:10.797
I heard they're bringing
in the psychiatrist

42:10.831 --> 42:12.999
for all the kids who
had to see you naked.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.535
Shut up, Alan.

42:14.568 --> 42:16.737
Whoo!
Whoo!

42:16.770 --> 42:18.539
Hey, Sam, I heard
you streaked!

42:18.572 --> 42:20.273
Way to go!

42:20.306 --> 42:23.009
(CHEERING)

42:23.043 --> 42:24.545
Shut up!

42:26.112 --> 42:28.214
All right, Sam.

42:29.950 --> 42:32.553
You guys are losers,
and you always will be.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.923
How come you're the one
riding home with no friends?

42:39.125 --> 42:41.327
You're like a god.

42:41.361 --> 42:42.796
People are gonna
worship you.

42:45.431 --> 42:47.267
(PLAYING ALONG
WITH RECORDING)

43:12.859 --> 43:15.696
I play so much better
when you're around.

43:17.363 --> 43:20.701
Hey, I want to play it again.
Put more dry ice
in the bucket.

43:21.835 --> 43:22.836
Sure.

43:28.141 --> 43:29.142
Thanks.
