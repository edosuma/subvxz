WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.000 --> 01:09.208
Rabbit: Scarf.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.875
Piglet: Uh, check.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.208
Earmuffs.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.583
Tigger: Checkarooni.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.125
Hot water bottle.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.583
Hot water bottle!

01:17.583 --> 01:20.291
Pooh, the hot
water bottle.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.958
I believe it's
in Rabbit's house.

01:22.958 --> 01:28.583
Oh, dear-- Do I have
to do everything myself?

01:28.583 --> 01:32.083
There's a life
that needs to be saved.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.875
There, there. Rabbit
will take care of you.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.291
Help! Help!

01:38.291 --> 01:40.500
Did you say something?

01:40.500 --> 01:43.083
Help!

01:43.083 --> 01:45.416
Help!

01:48.416 --> 01:50.083
Oh, dear, no!

01:50.083 --> 01:52.125
That poor little bird!

01:52.125 --> 01:55.291
I got to get a ladder!

01:55.291 --> 01:57.125
Forgive me.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.416
I got to go!

02:03.708 --> 02:05.583
Whoo-oo-oo!

02:06.750 --> 02:09.125
All: Whoa!

02:09.125 --> 02:12.333
Help!

02:14.000 --> 02:15.333
Ooh!

02:17.750 --> 02:19.583
Nice catch, bunny boy.

02:19.583 --> 02:23.958
Well, what do you know?
Ha ha. It's out of gas.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.375
Are you all right,
Rabbit?

02:33.375 --> 02:36.625
No! And I don't
plan on being all right

02:36.625 --> 02:39.000
for a very long time
to come!

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Cassie all right.

02:42.208 --> 02:44.708
Rabbit, you saved her.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.000
Why, you're a hero.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.833
Hero! Fiddle-dee-dee!
Look at my house!

02:49.833 --> 02:51.083
It's a mess!

02:51.083 --> 02:53.000
Cassie sorry.

02:54.083 --> 02:57.416
Oh, there, there.
It's not your fault.

02:57.416 --> 03:01.708
Then I don't know
whose fault it is!

03:01.708 --> 03:04.458
Ah, well,
now that we've got you,

03:04.458 --> 03:06.416
what are we supposed
to do with you?

03:06.416 --> 03:10.708
Why, Tigger and Piglet and I
shall take care of her.

03:10.708 --> 03:13.083
Ha! You three.

03:13.083 --> 03:16.083
You can't even take care
of a-- a carrot.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.583
I'll take care of her myself.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.708
Oh, you don't believe
I can do it all alone, huh?

03:21.708 --> 03:25.083
Well, Well,
I don't need anyone.

03:25.083 --> 03:28.458
Why, there's probably no one
in all the Hundred Acre Wood

03:28.458 --> 03:31.500
who knows more about
baby birds than me.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.875
Uh, Rabbit--

03:32.875 --> 03:36.416
Why, she's going to be
no trouble at all.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.083
Rabbit.

03:38.083 --> 03:41.416
I up so high.

03:41.416 --> 03:43.833
No trouble at all.

03:45.708 --> 03:47.500
Waah!

03:50.583 --> 03:55.208
driving me crazy

03:55.208 --> 03:58.875
Waah!

04:00.416 --> 04:01.708
There.

04:04.958 --> 04:08.708
I'm glad one of us
is enjoying this.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.250
Daddy sad?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.458
Daddy?

04:11.458 --> 04:14.000
No, no, no. I'm Rabbit.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.333
Rabby?

04:15.333 --> 04:17.958
Rabbit. Rabbit!

04:17.958 --> 04:19.500
-  Oh!

04:21.458 --> 04:23.458
Back! Back, you monster!

04:32.333 --> 04:34.000
Good morning, Rabbit.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.250
Hmm. I see you're
having breakfast.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.000
May we join you?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.750
Join me? Join me?

04:44.458 --> 04:47.416
She's all yours! I don't
care what happens to her!

04:47.416 --> 04:49.833
I have a parrot catch--
I mean, a carrot patch--

04:53.250 --> 04:56.458
Waah!

04:57.458 --> 05:00.625
There, there. Quiet down.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.833
Well? What are you
looking at?

05:05.833 --> 05:08.000
Haven't you ever
seen a baby cry?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.625
Ahem. Here.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.458
Just give her a bath.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.958
That'll keep her and you
out of trouble.

05:15.291 --> 05:19.000
Pooh, why is Rabbit
always so--

05:19.000 --> 05:20.875
so grumpy
around Cassie?

05:20.875 --> 05:24.125
Well, perhaps he's just
not as fond of her

05:24.125 --> 05:25.500
as we are, Piglet.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.458
Pip.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.000
Pip.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.291
Piglet, could you
possibly find me

05:34.291 --> 05:37.708
a small,
bird-sized towel?

05:43.375 --> 05:44.583
Oh, bother.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.708
Cassie. Cassie.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.750
Here's the towel, Pooh.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.708
Uh, Pooh?

05:57.375 --> 05:59.166
Ah. Perfect.

05:59.166 --> 06:02.166
Why, I'll plant my carrots
so early this year,

06:02.166 --> 06:04.708
they'll be ripe by springtime.

06:04.708 --> 06:07.000
- What's that?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.250
See me, Rabby?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.708
Oh! Oh, my!

06:15.708 --> 06:18.375
She'll float away!
She'll never come down!

06:18.375 --> 06:20.000
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

06:20.000 --> 06:23.875
I got you-ou-ou! Aah!

06:23.875 --> 06:25.708
Yiie!

06:25.708 --> 06:29.958
I...hate...heights!

06:29.958 --> 06:32.375
Rabby!

06:33.958 --> 06:36.416
Oh. Cassie.

06:36.416 --> 06:39.458
Rabby, did you see me?

06:39.458 --> 06:42.000
Now, Cassie, promise me

06:42.000 --> 06:45.583
you won't go so high
ever again.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.083
It's not safe.

06:47.083 --> 06:50.125
But-- But I like it.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.000
But I like you.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.458
And I don't want anything
to happen to you.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.083
I promise, Rabby.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.458
Am I doing this right,
Rabby?

07:14.458 --> 07:16.250
Not bad.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.583
But you have to choke up
on your grip.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.125
Ouch.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.583
And what is this?

07:23.583 --> 07:26.750
Well, it's--
it's mine.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.458
What?

07:28.458 --> 07:31.583
Well, when you taught me
how to plant carrots,

07:31.583 --> 07:33.583
that was my very first one.

07:33.583 --> 07:38.333
I was going to save it
special for you.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.458
Aw.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.000
--

07:42.000 --> 07:44.458
Well,
you should have told me.

07:44.458 --> 07:48.291
Look. I stubbed my toe.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.708
Aw, I'm sorry.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.083
Oh, that's all right.

07:53.083 --> 07:56.000
Now why don't you
just run along and--

07:57.291 --> 07:59.416
Hiya, bunny boy.
Just dropped by

07:59.416 --> 08:01.583
to see if the kiddo
can come out and play.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.958
Rabby, please?

08:03.958 --> 08:07.458
Yeah, Rabby, please?

08:07.458 --> 08:09.833
Uhh...
no, she can't.

08:09.833 --> 08:13.958
I-- I was just teaching
her something useful:

08:13.958 --> 08:15.833
how to weed carrots.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.875
Ooh, is he lucky.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.458
Weeding carrots is
what tiggers do best.

08:22.958 --> 08:25.333
Oh, no. Stop! Stop!

08:25.333 --> 08:26.625
What's the matter?

08:26.625 --> 08:29.333
Am I making you look bad
in front of the kid?

08:29.333 --> 08:32.833
Eh-- You're pulling up
my carrots!

08:32.833 --> 08:35.458
Oh. So these are carrots, huh?

08:35.458 --> 08:38.458
Well, what do you know.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.458
Whee!

08:47.000 --> 08:49.500
Well, what do you say,
Cassarino?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.083
Does Uncle Tigger know
how to bounce or what?

08:53.833 --> 08:58.166
I bet you're the best
bouncer in the whole world!

08:58.166 --> 09:00.708
Aw, ha ha, that was nothing.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.000
Now I'm going
to clear that tree.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.750
Whee! It's almost
like we were flying.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.750
And now that one.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.333
Uh, actually, uh,

09:12.333 --> 09:14.958
I'll embarrass the tree
if I jump it all at once,

09:14.958 --> 09:17.708
so, uh, I'll take it
in three bounces.

09:19.708 --> 09:22.500
Oh, Uncle Tigger,
that was fun!

09:22.500 --> 09:24.875
- Uh-oh.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.208
Yow!

09:30.583 --> 09:33.083
There. That wasn't so bad--

09:33.083 --> 09:34.083
Yaah!

09:35.125 --> 09:37.416
Cassie: Help! Help!

09:37.416 --> 09:38.583
echo: Help!

09:39.875 --> 09:43.583
Help!

09:43.583 --> 09:44.875
Cassie.

09:56.500 --> 10:01.000
I can't-- I can't move.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.500
I'm-- I'm slipping.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.833
H-Help me, Rabby!

10:05.833 --> 10:09.583
Hold on, Cassie!
I'll save you!

10:10.583 --> 10:12.291
Aah!

10:13.458 --> 10:15.333
- Help!
-

10:16.625 --> 10:18.958
What to do? What to do?

10:20.125 --> 10:21.458
Tigger!

10:21.458 --> 10:24.458
Swing your tail
and toss Cassie up to me!

10:25.625 --> 10:28.583
1 for the money,
2 for the show,

10:28.583 --> 10:29.875
3 to get out of here,

10:29.875 --> 10:32.500
and here you go!

10:32.500 --> 10:36.125
Hold on tight, Cassie.

10:36.125 --> 10:39.458
I'll pull you up.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.833
Rabby!

10:45.291 --> 10:48.458
Cassie!

10:49.500 --> 10:51.625
Rabby!

10:51.625 --> 10:53.125
I've got to get her back!

10:57.458 --> 10:59.333
Wait a minute, buddy boy.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.958
She's-- She's gone.

11:04.125 --> 11:07.208
Owl: Hoo, why,
a vertical half-gainer!

11:07.208 --> 11:08.708
How unusual.

11:08.708 --> 11:12.375
You know, I recall
I had an uncle Horatio

11:12.375 --> 11:15.625
who used to dive
in just that manner.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.833
Uh, excuse me, uh, Mr. Owl.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.000
Yes, yes, yes.
Now where was I?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.458
Oh, right. Uncle Horatio.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.333
Oh, Tigger,

11:28.333 --> 11:32.708
I never even told her
I loved her.

11:32.708 --> 11:35.000
Rabby!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.208
Cassie.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.208
Yahoo!

11:39.208 --> 11:43.166
Oh, and then, after Horatio
took third place at Rome,

11:43.166 --> 11:46.875
he went off to Acapulco--
or was it Topeka?

11:46.875 --> 11:47.875
Oh, never mind.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.250
Did you see us?
We were flying.

11:51.250 --> 11:54.000
Cassie, you're all right.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.458
More than all right,

12:00.458 --> 12:04.000
she was absolutely
made for flying.

12:12.416 --> 12:15.875
Yeah. And-- And Owl's
going to teach me.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.375
It shall be
my pleasure, my dear.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.708
A little practice,
and-- and--

12:20.708 --> 12:23.583
well, you'll be able
to fly south for the winter.

12:23.583 --> 12:24.583
Oh, yes.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.083
F-Fly s-south?

12:27.083 --> 12:31.500
Never! You-- You keep your
big feathers out of this!

12:31.500 --> 12:34.250
Why, if-- if she were
meant to fly south,

12:34.250 --> 12:36.208
she-- she'd have wings.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.208
So there.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.458
But, Rabby,

12:40.458 --> 12:43.333
I do have wings.

12:43.333 --> 12:46.708
Cassie, flying will
lead to no good.

12:46.708 --> 12:49.000
Remember
the promise you made me

12:49.000 --> 12:51.333
about not going
too high?

12:51.333 --> 12:53.875
Well, yes, but--

12:53.875 --> 12:57.458
Good. Ha ha. Ahem.
Then no more talk
about flying.

12:57.458 --> 13:01.416
Ho ho. We're going to have
lots more fun than flying.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.458
"And the pretty
little princess bird

13:04.458 --> 13:07.291
"was thrown into a deep,
dark dungeon,

13:07.291 --> 13:10.708
"with only her faithful
friend Rabby to protect her.

13:10.708 --> 13:14.625
But then, when things
looked blackest, and--"

13:14.625 --> 13:15.875
Huh?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.708
Oh, Pooh Bear.

14:23.708 --> 14:26.500
Please don't tell Rabby
I'm learning to fly.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.375
It would--
It would make him so sad.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.708
It looks to me as if
you're learning to fall.

14:32.708 --> 14:34.875
I'm not very good, huh?

14:34.875 --> 14:39.000
Oh, no. Very good
for going down.

14:40.250 --> 14:44.625
What you need
is a way for going up.

14:54.625 --> 14:58.416
Now, as soon as you're up,
raise the landing gear.

14:58.416 --> 15:00.500
Your legs.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.708
Like this?

15:03.708 --> 15:08.708
Yes. Now are you ready
for takeoff?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.375
No, she's not!

15:11.375 --> 15:13.583
Because she's not flying!

15:13.583 --> 15:15.458
Hello, Rabbit.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.375
Don't hello me,
Pooh Bear.

15:19.208 --> 15:22.000
You're deliberately
teaching Cassie to fly

15:22.000 --> 15:23.458
and against my wishes.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.833
But, Rabbit, you only said

15:25.833 --> 15:28.875
for Owl
not to teach her how to.

15:28.875 --> 15:32.333
When I say owls,
I mean bears, too!

15:32.333 --> 15:35.333
And you, how could you?

15:35.333 --> 15:37.833
You-- You promised.

15:37.833 --> 15:43.000
But-- But, Rabby,
I-- I just have to fly.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.625
It-- It means
everything to me.

15:46.625 --> 15:50.333
Does it mean
more than I do?

15:50.333 --> 15:52.458
Hey, bunny boy,

15:52.458 --> 15:54.625
why don't you
give the kid a chance?

15:54.625 --> 15:58.833
You stay out of this,
and just let go of that.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.875
But-- But--

15:59.875 --> 16:01.458
Right now.

16:01.458 --> 16:04.583
Whaah!

16:06.708 --> 16:09.125
Rabby!

16:09.125 --> 16:11.875
Ooh. Why didn't I
stay in my garden

16:11.875 --> 16:13.583
with my nice, safe carrots?

16:23.750 --> 16:24.833
Hooray!

16:24.833 --> 16:26.625
- Yeah!
- Hooray, Cassie!

16:26.625 --> 16:28.750
Tigger: Way to fly!

16:28.750 --> 16:30.625
Have I hit yet?

16:30.625 --> 16:32.583
No, Rabbit.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.000
Cassie saved you.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.750
Cassie? But how?

16:38.750 --> 16:41.375
I flew, Rabby.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.000
- You what?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.375
Oh, yes,
aren't you proud of me?

16:46.375 --> 16:49.208
- Yay!
- Oh, now I can fly south.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.208
Hey! That's right.
You soloed!

16:52.208 --> 16:53.708
Oh, boy, kiddo,

16:53.708 --> 16:56.000
there's nothing
holding you down now.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.875
Rabbit:
Don't you think I know?

17:16.333 --> 17:17.708
Rabby?

17:19.083 --> 17:23.333
Um, um, Rabby,
could you--

17:23.333 --> 17:27.833
would you read me
one last bedtime story?

17:27.833 --> 17:31.083
You mean before you leave?

17:31.083 --> 17:32.708
Oh, no. I didn't mean that.

17:32.708 --> 17:33.875
I meant, uh--

17:33.875 --> 17:37.500
You don't need me
to read you a bedtime story.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.958
You don't need me
for anything.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.750
And then, when you
feel the drag ratio

18:26.750 --> 18:29.000
overcome
your lateral velocity,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.250
voilà-- flight.

18:35.833 --> 18:38.250
Get ready
for takeoff, kiddo,

18:38.250 --> 18:40.458
before you're snowed in
for the whole winter.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.625
But where's Rabby?

18:44.625 --> 18:47.458
I can't leave without
saying goodbye to him.

18:47.458 --> 18:52.291
I'm sure he was just busy
with his garden.

18:52.291 --> 18:56.125
His garden.

18:59.458 --> 19:02.750
Oh, where is it?
Where is it?

19:02.750 --> 19:06.750
Ahem. Hoo, it seems
the time is right,

19:06.750 --> 19:08.583
and the time is now.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.000
And I'd just like to say--

19:11.000 --> 19:13.500
Hey, Cassarino,
before you go,

19:13.500 --> 19:15.583
how's about a little S.O.T.T.:

19:15.583 --> 19:17.375
Smooch On the Tigger?

19:18.583 --> 19:19.958
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

19:19.958 --> 19:22.500
That's what tiggers love best.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.958
Oh! Ooh. Ah, there it is.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.291
Oh. For me?

19:37.291 --> 19:41.000
Be careful. You know,
that's a very strong wind.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.166
I know Rabbit's
real busy, Pooh,

19:50.166 --> 19:53.708
but could you remember
to tell him, uh,

19:53.708 --> 19:55.333
I'll never forget him?

19:55.333 --> 19:58.875
I'll remember to t--
to tell--

19:58.875 --> 20:00.208
What was it?

20:00.208 --> 20:02.833
Now, my dear,
it's time to soar.

20:04.625 --> 20:07.458
Wait for me.
I'm coming, Cassie!

20:07.458 --> 20:12.333
Oh, do give my regards
to everyone down south.

20:25.583 --> 20:28.166
- Yay!
- Wonderful!
- Hooray!

20:28.166 --> 20:29.750
- Yippee!
- She's off! She's off!

20:29.750 --> 20:31.958
Up, up, up, my dear.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.250
- Way to fly!
- Yes!

20:34.250 --> 20:36.125
Rabbit: Wait! Wait!

20:36.125 --> 20:39.416
Cassie! Don't go!

20:39.416 --> 20:40.708
Rabbit?

20:40.708 --> 20:42.875
I changed my mind!

20:42.875 --> 20:44.708
You can fly!

20:44.708 --> 20:48.250
Just don't go away, Cassie.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.250
Cassie. Oh, Cassie.

21:20.958 --> 21:25.291
Did you think I would leave
without saying goodbye to you?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.250
I hope spring decides
to come early this year.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.333
I can't wait
to see Cassie again.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.583
It's the most
peculiar thing.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.958
For the longest time,
I thought Rabbit
didn't like her.

21:38.958 --> 21:44.291
You know, Piglet, sometimes
people care too much.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.000
I think it's called love.

21:48.291 --> 21:51.291
Oh. Do you think
we should tell Rabbit?

21:51.291 --> 21:55.375
Don't worry.
I believe
he already knows.
