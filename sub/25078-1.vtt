00:41.465 --> 00:43.050
A hundred years ago

00:43.175 --> 00:47.388
there were one and a half
billion people on Earth.

00:49.264 --> 00:54.312
Now, over six billion
crowd our fragile planet.

00:55.772 --> 01:01.695
But even so, there are still places
barely touched by humanity.

01:06.826 --> 01:10.914
This series will take to the last wildernesses

01:11.039 --> 01:14.084
and show you the planet
and its wildlife

01:14.209 --> 01:17.003
as you have never
seen them before.

02:07.892 --> 02:11.771
Imagine our world without sun.

02:12.980 --> 02:18.653
Male Emperor Penguins are facing
the nearest that exists on planet Earth -

02:18.821 --> 02:21.323
winter in Antarctica.

02:23.159 --> 02:24.869
It's continuously dark

02:24.994 --> 02:30.165
and temperatures drop
to minus 70 degrees centigrade.

02:40.678 --> 02:44.057
The penguins stay
when all other creatures have fled

02:44.182 --> 02:46.726
because each guards a treasure:

02:46.851 --> 02:50.021
A single egg rested
on the top of its feet

02:50.146 --> 02:54.109
and kept warm beneath
the downy bulge of its stomach.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.951
There is no food
and no water for them,

03:02.076 --> 03:05.662
and they will not see
the sun again for four months.

03:05.788 --> 03:10.751
Surely no greater ordeal
is faced by any animal.

03:20.930 --> 03:24.016
As the sun departs
from the Antarctic

03:24.141 --> 03:27.770
it lightens the skies
in the far north.

03:36.571 --> 03:37.906
It's March

03:38.031 --> 03:41.160
and light returns
to the high Arctic,

03:41.285 --> 03:44.914
sweeping away
four months of darkness.

03:57.928 --> 04:00.597
A polar bear stirs.

04:00.723 --> 04:04.143
She has been in her den
the whole winter.

04:04.226 --> 04:08.690
Her emergence marks
the beginning of spring.

04:11.193 --> 04:13.820
After months of confinement underground

04:13.946 --> 04:15.989
she toboggans down the slope.

04:16.113 --> 04:18.242
Perhaps to clean her fur,

04:18.450 --> 04:21.329
perhaps for sheer joy.

04:36.261 --> 04:39.890
Her cubs gaze out
of their bright new world

04:40.015 --> 04:42.225
for the very first time.

04:44.646 --> 04:46.438
The female calls them,

04:46.565 --> 04:52.613
but this steep slope is not
the easiest place to take your first steps.

05:05.876 --> 05:07.461
But they are hungry

05:07.586 --> 05:09.214
and eager to reach their mother,

05:09.339 --> 05:12.884
who's delayed feeding them
on this special day.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.553
Now she lures them with the promise of milk,

05:15.678 --> 05:18.974
the only food the cubs have known
since they were born

05:19.100 --> 05:23.979
deaf and blind beneath the snow
some two months ago.

05:40.414 --> 05:43.918
Their mother has not eaten
for five months

05:44.043 --> 05:46.880
and has lost half her body weight.

05:47.088 --> 05:53.220
Now she converts the last of her fat
reserves into milk for her cubs.

06:12.032 --> 06:14.743
The spring sun brings warmth

06:14.868 --> 06:17.789
but also a problem for the mother.

06:18.247 --> 06:21.166
It starts to melt the sea ice.

06:21.291 --> 06:25.463
That is where she hunts for the seal
she needs to feed her cubs.

06:25.588 --> 06:29.301
And she must get there
before the ice breaks up.

06:33.137 --> 06:36.475
For now though
it's still minus thirty degrees

06:36.600 --> 06:40.145
and the cubs must have
the shelter of the den.

06:54.119 --> 06:57.289
It's six days since the bears emerged

06:57.414 --> 07:00.126
and spring is advancing rapidly.

07:00.251 --> 07:04.046
But even now blizzards
can strike without warning.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.343
Being so small,

07:08.468 --> 07:13.307
the cubs are easily chilled and they will
be more comfortable resting in the den.

07:13.432 --> 07:16.643
But their mother must keep them out and active.

07:18.145 --> 07:19.855
She's becoming weak from hunger

07:19.980 --> 07:23.067
and there's no food
on these nursery slopes.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.994
The sea ice still holds firm,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.663
but it won't last much longer.

07:38.083 --> 07:38.959
Day 10,

07:39.209 --> 07:42.922
and the mother has led
her cubs a mile from the den.

07:43.047 --> 07:45.925
It's time to put them to the test.

07:48.470 --> 07:51.181
They've grown enormously in confidence,

07:51.306 --> 07:55.227
but they don't have
their mother's sense of urgency.

08:10.911 --> 08:14.415
At last it seems that they're
ready for their journey

08:14.540 --> 08:16.250
and they're only just in time,

08:16.416 --> 08:21.088
for a few miles from the coast
the ice is already splitting.

08:27.428 --> 08:31.141
Now the mother can start hunting
for the seals they must have,

08:31.266 --> 08:35.938
but she's leading her cubs
into a dangerous new world.

08:36.605 --> 08:41.986
Nearly half of all cubs die
in their first year out on the ice.

08:52.205 --> 08:55.751
Summer brings 24 hours of sunlight

08:55.876 --> 08:59.213
and the thawing shifting landscape.

09:01.924 --> 09:07.347
Further south the winter snows have
almost cleared from the Arctic tundra.

09:15.606 --> 09:18.859
Northern Canada's wild frontier.

09:18.984 --> 09:23.698
Here nature stages
one of her greatest dramas -

09:31.206 --> 09:37.797
Every year three million caribou
migrate across the Arctic tundra.

09:50.685 --> 09:57.110
The immensity of the herd can only
be properly appreciated from the air.

10:04.241 --> 10:10.248
Some herds travel over 2,000 miles
a year in search of fresh pastures.

10:10.373 --> 10:16.464
This is the longest overland
migration made by any animal.

10:27.726 --> 10:30.104
They're constantly on the move.

10:30.229 --> 10:34.274
Newborn calves have to be
up and running the day they are born.

10:55.340 --> 11:00.136
But the vast herds
do not travel alone.

11:02.721 --> 11:04.099
Wolves.

11:06.559 --> 11:11.398
Packs of them, eight to ten strong,
shadow the migration.

11:13.359 --> 11:14.735
And they are hungry.

11:20.449 --> 11:24.621
It's the newly born calves
that they are after.

11:31.754 --> 11:36.467
Running directly at the herd
is a ploy to generate panic.

11:47.104 --> 11:48.563
The herd breaks up

11:48.689 --> 11:52.526
and now it's easier
to target an individual.

12:03.204 --> 12:07.333
In the chaos a calf is
separated from its mother.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.259
The calf is young,

12:15.384 --> 12:20.139
but it can outrun the wolf
if only it manages to keep its footing.

12:32.945 --> 12:35.782
At this stage
the odds are even -

12:35.907 --> 12:38.076
either the caribou
will make a mistake

12:38.201 --> 12:41.329
or after a mile
the wolf will give up.

13:30.674 --> 13:32.759
Midsummer on the tundra

13:32.885 --> 13:35.596
and the sun does not set.

13:38.557 --> 13:42.437
At these latitudes
the sun's rays are glancing

13:42.562 --> 13:45.273
and not enough of their energy reaches the ground

13:45.440 --> 13:47.984
to enable trees to grow.

13:50.446 --> 13:53.616
You'll need to travel
500 miles south from here

13:53.782 --> 13:55.617
before that is possible.

14:01.917 --> 14:05.546
These stunted shrubs
mark the tree line -

14:05.671 --> 14:08.966
the beginning of the boreal forest -

14:09.175 --> 14:10.342
the taiga.

14:19.811 --> 14:23.857
The needle-shaped leaves
of the conifers are virtually inedible

14:23.982 --> 14:27.861
so this forest supports
very little animal life.

14:34.536 --> 14:36.119
It's a silent place

14:36.246 --> 14:40.082
where the snow is unmarked
by footprints.

14:49.343 --> 14:51.136
In the Arctic winter

14:51.262 --> 14:55.600
snow forms a continuous blanket
across the land.

14:55.850 --> 14:58.645
But as spring creeps up
from the south

14:58.770 --> 15:01.773
the taiga is unveiled.

15:07.196 --> 15:10.324
This vast forest circling the globe

15:10.449 --> 15:13.953
contains a third
of all the trees on Earth

15:14.078 --> 15:16.164
and produces so much oxygen

15:16.289 --> 15:20.084
it changes the composition
of the atmosphere.

15:22.712 --> 15:24.381
As we travel south

15:24.506 --> 15:27.634
so the sun's influence
grows stronger

15:27.759 --> 15:33.933
and at 50 degrees of latitude
a radical transformation begins.

15:43.819 --> 15:50.451
Summers here are long enough for
broadleaf trees to replace conifers.

15:50.660 --> 15:54.455
Broadleaves are much easier
to eat and digest

15:54.580 --> 15:57.791
so now animals can collect
their share of the energy

15:57.918 --> 15:59.878
that has come from the sun.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.381
It's summer

16:02.506 --> 16:06.092
and these forests
are bustling with life.

16:32.497 --> 16:35.666
But the good times
will not last.

16:37.544 --> 16:42.049
Broad leaves must be shed in winter
for their damage by frost.

16:42.174 --> 16:43.633
As they disappear,

16:43.759 --> 16:48.722
so the land becomes barren
with little for animals to eat.

16:57.023 --> 16:59.484
The inhabitants must migrate,

16:59.609 --> 17:00.902
hibernate,

17:01.069 --> 17:04.281
or face months of near starvation.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.759
The Amur leopard -

17:24.803 --> 17:27.638
the rarest cat in the world.

17:30.726 --> 17:33.855
Here, in the deciduous forests of eastern Russia

17:33.980 --> 17:36.857
the winter makes hunting
very difficult.

17:36.901 --> 17:38.651
Pray animals are scarce,

17:38.776 --> 17:41.696
and there's no concealing vegetation.

17:44.783 --> 17:48.787
The cub is a year old
and still dependent on its mother.

17:57.297 --> 18:00.926
Deer are frequent casualties
of the harsh winter

18:01.051 --> 18:05.138
and these leopards are not above
scavenging from a corpse.

18:05.681 --> 18:09.185
African leopards could
never survive here,

18:09.310 --> 18:14.440
but the Russian cats have thick fur
to shield them from the cold.

18:20.321 --> 18:24.118
There are only forty
Amur leopards left in the wild

18:24.243 --> 18:26.286
and that number is falling.

18:27.955 --> 18:29.414
Like so many creatures,

18:29.541 --> 18:32.502
the cats have been pushed
to the very edge of extinction

18:32.627 --> 18:36.464
by hunting and the destruction
of their habitat.

18:38.425 --> 18:44.139
The Amur leopard symbolizes
the fragility of our natural heritage.

18:44.764 --> 18:48.977
The future of an entire species
hangs on survival

18:49.103 --> 18:53.108
of a tiny number of mothers
like this one.

18:58.697 --> 19:01.074
All animals, rare or common,

19:01.199 --> 19:05.204
ultimately depend
for their energy on the sun.

19:13.087 --> 19:15.798
In Japan the arrival
of the cherry blossom

19:15.923 --> 19:18.927
announces the beginning of spring.

19:40.409 --> 19:44.747
The sun's energy brings
color to the landscape.

19:54.715 --> 19:58.344
The earth, as it makes its annual
journey around the sun,

19:58.469 --> 20:01.097
spins on a tilted axis.

20:01.223 --> 20:05.310
And it's this tilt
that creates the seasons.

20:30.880 --> 20:35.344
The advance of the seasons
brings constant change.

20:36.386 --> 20:39.305
As the sun's influence diminishes in the north,

20:39.430 --> 20:44.019
so the deciduous forests of America
begin to shut down

20:44.144 --> 20:49.441
losing their leaves in preparation
for the dark cold months ahead.

21:03.832 --> 21:06.753
One season hands over to another.

21:06.878 --> 21:09.797
Some organisms thrive on decay,

21:09.923 --> 21:13.551
but most must make special
preparations for winter

21:13.677 --> 21:16.137
and a life with little sun.

21:31.362 --> 21:33.490
Whole populations of animals

21:33.615 --> 21:39.872
are now forced to travel great distances
in pursuit of food and warmth.

21:45.211 --> 21:51.425
300,000 Baikal teal gather
to escape from the Siberian winter

21:51.550 --> 21:55.138
by migrating south to Korea -

21:57.766 --> 22:02.312
the world's entire population
in a single flock.

22:06.484 --> 22:11.072
But there are parts of the world
that have no seasons.

22:14.408 --> 22:18.580
In the tropics the sun's rays
strike the earth head on

22:18.705 --> 22:23.294
and their strength is
more or less constant all year round.

22:25.671 --> 22:28.507
That is why the jungle
grows so vigorously

22:28.632 --> 22:31.218
and supports so much life.

22:32.887 --> 22:36.766
This forest covers only 3 percent
of the planet's surface,

22:36.891 --> 22:42.189
but it contains more than 50 percent
of all its plants and animals.

22:45.776 --> 22:48.946
The canopy is particularly rich.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.156
There are monkeys, birds

22:51.283 --> 22:53.618
and millions of species of insects,

22:53.743 --> 22:56.747
exactly how many we have no idea.

22:59.207 --> 23:02.627
The character of the forest
changes as we descend,

23:02.752 --> 23:05.298
becoming ever darker and damper,

23:05.423 --> 23:09.218
favoring different kinds
of animals and plants.

23:15.100 --> 23:18.520
Less than 2 percent
of the sunlight reaches the floor,

23:18.645 --> 23:22.442
but even here there is
extraordinary variety.

23:31.492 --> 23:33.704
In the great island of New Guinea

23:33.829 --> 23:37.332
there are 42 different species
of birds of paradise,

23:37.458 --> 23:39.834
each more bizarre than the last.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.908
This forest is so rich

24:09.033 --> 24:12.370
that nourishing food can be gathered very quickly.

24:12.537 --> 24:15.540
That leaves the male
six-plumed bird of paradise

24:15.665 --> 24:18.251
with time to concentrate
on other matters

24:18.376 --> 24:21.714
like tidying up his display area.

24:31.349 --> 24:34.519
Everything must be spick and span.

24:42.653 --> 24:44.280
All is ready.

25:05.469 --> 25:06.845
Very impressive,

25:07.097 --> 25:09.223
but no one is watching.

25:11.310 --> 25:15.981
The superb bird of paradise
calls to attract a female.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.903
And he has more luck.

25:21.695 --> 25:26.033
But what does he have to do
to really impress her?

25:52.021 --> 25:55.107
She retires to consider her verdict.

26:01.780 --> 26:04.117
It's hard not to feel deflated

26:04.242 --> 26:07.162
when even your best
isn't good enough.

26:27.934 --> 26:33.690
The sun influences life in the oceans
just as it does on land.

27:20.783 --> 27:24.495
Its richest parts are those
where waves and currents

27:24.621 --> 27:27.832
bring fertilizing nutrients
to surface waters

27:27.957 --> 27:29.960
that are bathed in sunlight.

27:30.210 --> 27:34.673
The seas off the Cape in South Africa
have this magic recipe

27:34.798 --> 27:37.217
and are hugely productive.

27:41.055 --> 27:43.140
Summer is the time of plenty

27:43.265 --> 27:46.978
and it's now that the seals
start to breed.

28:11.714 --> 28:16.468
The strike of a great white shark
lasts a mere second.

28:16.593 --> 28:20.473
Slowing it down forty times
reveals the technique

28:20.598 --> 28:24.268
and immense strength
of this massive predator.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.646
If surprise fails,

29:04.771 --> 29:06.898
there will be a chase.

29:17.159 --> 29:20.371
The shark is faster
on a straight course

29:20.496 --> 29:23.750
but it can't turn
as sharply as the seal,

29:26.461 --> 29:28.880
its agility versus power.

30:24.524 --> 30:26.943
Once the seals have finished breeding

30:27.069 --> 30:29.445
the giant sharks will move on.

30:32.032 --> 30:33.576
It's now becoming clear

30:33.701 --> 30:37.663
that great whites migrate
thousands of miles across the oceans

30:37.788 --> 30:42.376
to harvest seasonal abundances
in different seas.

31:09.322 --> 31:12.784
The sun, beating down
on tropical waters,

31:12.910 --> 31:15.745
powers the weather systems
of the globe.

31:16.038 --> 31:18.874
Moisture evaporates
from the warming ocean

31:18.999 --> 31:22.295
and rises to create
great storms.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.862
The winds generated out at sea

31:45.987 --> 31:49.407
sweep inland across the continents.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.464
As they travel across the Sahara

32:03.589 --> 32:07.010
they create the biggest
of all sand storms

32:07.135 --> 32:09.387
blowing sand halfway
round the world

32:09.512 --> 32:12.683
to fertilize the Amazon jungle.

32:17.647 --> 32:20.900
Winds blowing across the Indian Ocean

32:21.067 --> 32:25.780
collect moisture and sweep northwards
towards the Himalayas.

32:26.823 --> 32:30.160
As the air rises,
so it cools.

32:34.665 --> 32:36.125
The water it carries

32:36.250 --> 32:38.377
condenses into clouds

32:38.586 --> 32:43.174
and then falls as the life giving
rains of the monsoon.

32:48.638 --> 32:51.975
So air currents
powered by the sun

32:52.101 --> 32:55.813
carry wet air to the middle of continents.

33:15.251 --> 33:16.627
Without water

33:16.794 --> 33:18.462
there can be no life,

33:18.587 --> 33:23.176
but its distribution
over the land is far from even.

33:29.933 --> 33:33.896
Deserts cover one third
of the land's surface

33:34.146 --> 33:36.941
and they're growing bigger
every year.

33:47.536 --> 33:51.707
This is the Kalahari Desert
in Southern Africa.

33:52.332 --> 33:54.168
It's the dry season

33:54.293 --> 33:57.172
and thousands of elephants
have started to travel

33:57.297 --> 33:59.966
in desperate search for water.

34:10.268 --> 34:15.983
All across Southern Africa animals
are journeying for the same reason.

34:19.070 --> 34:21.531
Buffalo join the great trek.

34:21.739 --> 34:25.201
Nowhere else on Earth
are so many animals on the move

34:25.284 --> 34:28.121
with the same urgent purpose.

34:32.292 --> 34:36.505
They're all heading
for the swamps of the Okavango,

34:36.589 --> 34:39.175
a vast inland delta.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.719
At the moment it is dry,

34:43.138 --> 34:45.264
but water is coming.

34:47.391 --> 34:52.438
The travelers are hampered
by dangerous dust storms.

34:55.943 --> 35:00.573
Females and calves can easily get
separated from the main herd.

35:17.091 --> 35:22.013
For this pair sanctuary lies
in the patch of woodland a few miles ahead.

35:22.180 --> 35:24.808
They can't rest
until they reach it.

35:41.117 --> 35:44.746
The main has already
got there safely.

35:49.919 --> 35:54.132
Finally, the stragglers
emerge from the dust.

35:58.678 --> 36:03.475
The exhausted calf is
still blinded by sand.

36:05.978 --> 36:09.690
Its mother does
everything possible to help it.

36:22.788 --> 36:25.499
The storm is now subsiding,

36:25.874 --> 36:29.002
but not all the elephants
have been so lucky.

36:29.587 --> 36:32.381
One youngster has got lost.

36:34.132 --> 36:36.176
Thirsty and exhausted,

36:36.260 --> 36:38.847
it follows the tracks
of its mother,

36:39.222 --> 36:42.893
but sadly
in the wrong direction.

37:07.128 --> 37:10.047
At the peak of the dry season
in the Kalahari

37:10.214 --> 37:13.217
water arrives in the Okavango.

37:13.301 --> 37:17.389
It fell as rain a thousand miles away
in the highlands of Angola

37:17.471 --> 37:21.059
and has taken nearly
five months to reach here.

37:27.399 --> 37:31.821
The water drives out insects
from the parched ground,

37:31.946 --> 37:34.324
which are snapped up by plovers.

37:37.910 --> 37:40.038
Catfish, traveling with the flood,

37:40.163 --> 37:44.001
collect any drowning creatures
the birds have missed.

37:54.887 --> 37:59.392
It's a seasonal feast
for animals of all kinds.

38:10.947 --> 38:14.408
Birds are the first
to arrive in any numbers -

38:14.533 --> 38:16.411
wattled cranes,

38:17.579 --> 38:20.206
then black storks.

38:22.125 --> 38:25.296
Behind the birds come buffalo.

38:25.421 --> 38:29.842
After weeks of marching
their trek is coming to an end.

38:48.821 --> 38:51.532
As the water sweeps into the Okavango

38:51.658 --> 38:58.331
a vast area of the Kalahari
is transformed into a fertile paradise.

39:01.417 --> 39:08.217
Nowhere on our planet is the life giving
power of water so clearly demonstrated.

39:12.263 --> 39:15.516
The Okavango becomes
criss-crossed with trails

39:15.641 --> 39:18.061
as animals move into its heart.

39:18.561 --> 39:21.439
The new arrivals open up
paths like arteries

39:21.523 --> 39:23.608
along which water flows,

39:23.692 --> 39:26.069
extending the reach of the flood.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.636
This is an Africa rarely seen -

39:50.345 --> 39:52.723
a lush water world.

40:10.618 --> 40:13.496
Some creatures are completely
at home here.

40:13.621 --> 40:15.581
These are lechwe -

40:15.706 --> 40:18.501
antelope with hooves that splay widely,

40:18.626 --> 40:22.089
enabling them to move
its speed through the water.

40:22.923 --> 40:26.552
For others the change
is far less welcome.

40:32.891 --> 40:36.897
Baboons are somewhat
apprehensive bathers.

41:09.307 --> 41:15.396
The water brings a season
of plenty for all animals.

41:29.329 --> 41:31.164
Hunting dogs.

41:51.227 --> 41:55.023
These are now among
the rarest of Africa's mammals,

41:55.148 --> 41:59.361
but then nonetheless
the continent's most efficient predators.

42:01.530 --> 42:04.449
Their secret is teamwork.

42:08.246 --> 42:11.248
Impala are their favorite prey.

42:12.375 --> 42:13.626
They start to hunt

42:13.751 --> 42:15.879
and the pack splits up.

42:16.796 --> 42:21.093
An aerial viewpoint gives
a new insight into their strategy.

42:22.136 --> 42:24.096
As the dogs approach their prey

42:24.221 --> 42:28.726
they peel off to take up separate
positions around their target.

42:40.781 --> 42:44.535
They seem to form
a cordon around the impala.

42:53.461 --> 42:55.672
Moving in total silence

42:55.797 --> 42:57.925
they take up their positions.

43:02.429 --> 43:06.058
Those ears can detect
the slightest rustle.

43:27.790 --> 43:29.668
The hunt is on.

43:33.588 --> 43:37.301
Three dogs close in
on one impala.

43:46.143 --> 43:47.103
Missed.

43:51.524 --> 43:56.112
The lead dog drives the impala
towards the hidden flankers.

44:06.248 --> 44:07.708
Anticipating their line

44:07.792 --> 44:09.544
the leader cuts the corner

44:09.627 --> 44:12.714
and joins a flanker
for the final assault.

44:15.008 --> 44:16.552
It's all or nothing.

44:16.634 --> 44:18.094
One on one.

44:22.432 --> 44:23.892
The dog has stamina,

44:24.017 --> 44:26.437
the impala has speed.

44:40.285 --> 44:43.580
Leaping into the lake
is an act of desperation -

44:43.705 --> 44:45.792
impala can barely swim.

44:49.629 --> 44:52.966
The dogs know their prey
must come out or drown -

44:53.050 --> 44:55.760
now it's a waiting game.

45:03.853 --> 45:06.313
The rest of the pack are calling.

45:07.690 --> 45:09.776
They've made a kill
in the forest

45:09.901 --> 45:13.571
and this is an invitation
to join in the meal.

45:17.326 --> 45:19.744
The impala is in luck.

45:27.754 --> 45:33.009
A pack this size kills once a day
and everything is shared.

45:42.478 --> 45:45.732
And this impala is reprieved.

45:54.282 --> 45:58.454
The elephants are nearing
the end of their long journey.

46:00.414 --> 46:05.086
After weeks of marching
they're desperately tired.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.888
The matriarch can smell water

46:14.972 --> 46:18.642
and encourages the herd
to make one last effort.

46:29.195 --> 46:30.780
The youngsters are exhausted

46:30.864 --> 46:33.283
but their mothers have made
this journey before

46:33.367 --> 46:35.911
and they know
that they're close to water.

46:53.346 --> 46:57.935
After many hundreds
of miles they've arrived.

48:08.678 --> 48:14.768
The lives of these elephants are dominated
by the annual rhythm of wet and dry,

48:14.852 --> 48:18.688
a seasonal cycle
created by the sun.

48:49.556 --> 48:51.432
At the southern end of the earth,

48:51.516 --> 48:54.185
after four months of total darkness,

48:54.269 --> 48:58.607
the sun once more
rises over Antarctica.

49:12.623 --> 49:17.377
Now at last the Emperor penguins
abandon their huddle.

49:17.461 --> 49:20.465
The males are still carrying
the precious eggs

49:20.547 --> 49:24.344
that they've cherished
throughout the Antarctic winter.

49:32.143 --> 49:36.231
With the returning sun
the eggs hatch.

49:37.441 --> 49:40.360
Other birds have
not even arrived.

49:40.444 --> 49:44.448
But the Emperors
by enduring the long black winter

49:44.532 --> 49:48.286
have given their chicks
a head start.

49:57.463 --> 50:05.180
These youngsters are now ready and eager
to make the most of the brief Antarctic summer.
