All right.

00:24.566 --> 00:29.404
Oh, good morning, pooper.
Are you so talky this morning?

00:29.487 --> 00:31.322
I wanna know. I wanna know.

00:31.406 --> 00:35.577
Tell me all about it.
Tell me all about it.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.011
What are you doing today, again?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.513
Uh... I got, like, ten sales calls.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.641
I'm trying to meet a bunch
of new bar owners today.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.768
How about you? Hmm?

01:00.477 --> 01:02.562
Noelle's coming over.
We're gonna make doggy treats.

-That's fun.
-Yeah.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.440
-How's that going?
-Good.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.442
We're doing a lot of experimenting
with flavors.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.444
-Yeah.
-Mmm. I'm enjoying.

01:09.527 --> 01:12.697

outside the box, all right?

I just put him down. So exciting!
You guys made so many. That's amazing.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.259
Yeah. We made enough to give the kid
sleeping pills if we want to.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.179
-Yeah.
-That's great, babe.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.097

what I wanted to tell you.

07:53.181 --> 07:57.226
-What?
-The rep for Chicago Fresh Market came,

07:57.310 --> 07:59.353
and they wanna maybe put us
in their stores.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.356

08:02.440 --> 08:06.611
-Don't say that like you're surprised!
-My entrepreneur. I'm so happy for you.

-I know, right?
-Babe, that is amazing.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.865
-I know. I'm fucking terrified!
-Shh.

but he was a real pain in the ass today.

and that's it.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.254
Yeah, but I thought we agreed that
for the first year

08:25.338 --> 08:28.674

That's-- That's all I'm saying.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.718

-I don't know.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.770

08:40.853 --> 08:43.314
than bring a stranger into our home
to take care of our kid.

you're gonna quit the brewery?

and it's probably nothing, so...

-Whatever.

-Great product, guys.

-[Noelle] Thanks.
-[Sherri] Thank you.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.154
There's a café.
Do you wanna sit down and chat?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.072
-Sure.
-Yeah, sure.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.407
-Nice to meet you.
-Bye.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.247
-[Matt]  What's up, Mark?
-Nice to see you.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.207
You too, man.
What are you guys pouring today?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.627
-I've finally got first lager into cans.
-Wow! Fancy.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.754
"There's no 'I' in beer."

09:48.838 --> 09:50.047
What'd you bring today?

09:50.131 --> 09:51.424
[Alex] Mark, you're up.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.883
-Later, man.
-See you, guys.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.761
I got a stout.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.056
I got a saison.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.766
What I'd like to do is start you here

10:00.850 --> 10:03.811
and eventually get you into all seven
of our locations around the city.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.479
-Okay.
-What do you think?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.607
-I think, yes.
-That's an amazing idea.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.819
Awesome. So, logistically, this is
the easiest packaging to merchandise.

10:11.902 --> 10:12.862
Okay.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.865
[Robyn] So, if we can get the other
flavors in this packaging as well...

10:15.948 --> 10:17.241
-[Alex]  Matt, you ready?
-Yeah.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.452
-Take it easy, John.
-See you around, man.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.873
Hey, Matt, what do you have for me today?

10:23.956 --> 10:29.003
I got a stout. I got a saison.
I got a lager.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.423
-We're really excited about the lager.
-Yeah?

10:32.506 --> 10:35.051
Yeah,
I think it's gonna be a big seller for us.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.179
-Well, let's give it a taste.
-Cool. There you go.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.271
-It's great, right?
-Yeah, yeah. It's good. It's good.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.689
You wanna try the stout?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.816
Why don't we hold off
on the stout for now, Matt?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.778
We love your IPA. It does well for us.
It really sells well.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.655
Thanks. We're really proud of that beer.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.658
I think that the lager's gonna do better
in the summertime.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.659
Okay.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.328
Little bit more lighter beer.
I wouldn't mind revisiting it then.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.245
Sure.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.873
-But--
-You know, I should...

11:05.956 --> 11:08.542
I forgot. I've been meaning to tell you
that, uh,

11:08.626 --> 11:10.586
that Jeff's been working
with the Dark Matter guys

11:10.670 --> 11:13.422
on a coffee something.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.841
-I heard about that.
-It's gonna be really interesting.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.427
If you could commit to a keg of it,
it would help us out.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.846
Gosh, Matt, committing to a keg right now
of coffee beer...

11:20.930 --> 11:23.516
I already have one on right now,
so, I mean, carrying two?

11:23.599 --> 11:26.394
-Jeff's taste is better than most.
-Yeah, but you know those don't sell.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.978
I mean, carrying two would be crazy.

11:28.562 --> 11:29.897
Let's talk about the lager
in the summer...

11:29.980 --> 11:31.982
I'm so excited you like it. Really, I am.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.651
-Good to see you, Matt.
-Great to see you.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.319
Thanks again, Alex, as always.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.158
[clears throat]

11:42.451 --> 11:43.536
-Can't wait to see you soon.
-Soon.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.912
Have a good day, guys.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.122
-Bye.
-Bye.

11:46.872 --> 11:47.957
[both squeal]

11:48.040 --> 11:50.126
-I'm so excited!
-Me, too.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.671
Oh, my God, I have to talk to Jeff.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.839
Jeff will be fine.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.758
I know, but he doesn't wanna be brewing
any IPAs anymore.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.052
Whatever. Fuck them. Whoo! [laughs]

12:01.053 --> 12:02.388
[Sherri] Hey, bubba.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.932
Hey, beautiful.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.559
How was your day?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.103
It was a day.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.188
That doesn't sound good.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.065
No, it was just long. I just...

12:13.149 --> 12:18.821
I was all over the city today,
but it's the same stuff, you know.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.450
You know. It's fine.
You know, it's fine. It was a fine day.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.452
-Wow.
-How was the meeting?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.829
Um, it was really good.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.872
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.957
-Good.
-They're gonna put a big order in.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.959
Like, a big order.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.420
And they're gonna start at the one store,

12:34.503 --> 12:36.505
and as soon as we're ready,
they're gonna put it in all seven.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.549
Yeah, big.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.847
I'm so excited for you.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.642
It means we're gonna need a lot of grain.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.938
[laughs]

12:53.022 --> 12:55.858
You want more IPA, you got it. More IPA.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.613
You okay?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.865
Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's just...

13:03.991 --> 13:06.327
I'm just gonna have to talk to Jeff
about all this.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.205
-[sighs]
-Okay. Well...

13:09.288 --> 13:11.665
It's gonna be fine.
He's just being a pain in the ass.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.337
He's all pissed off
about the IPA to begin with,

13:16.420 --> 13:18.506
because it's the only thing
anybody wants, so...

13:19.507 --> 13:20.508
But...

13:21.926 --> 13:23.010
ah, it'll be fine.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.387
Hey.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.305
Hmm?

13:26.847 --> 13:28.265
I'm so proud of you.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.977
I'm so excited.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.940
We've got our producer in Guatemala
malting coffee

13:36.023 --> 13:37.566
so that we can put that in the mash.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.692
I love it.

13:38.776 --> 13:42.363
He's harvesting the flowers
and drying them,

13:42.446 --> 13:45.991
and we're gonna keep the cherries,
put them in the boil,

13:46.075 --> 13:47.451
but gonna be worth it, man.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.204
God damn it, we're back. We're back, baby.
[chuckles]

13:50.788 --> 13:52.373
We're doing this, man.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.667
-So glad you're here, man.
-Fuckin' A, are you kidding?

13:54.750 --> 14:00.089
This is, like, the ultimate coffee beer,
and I'm just, like, I'm excited.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.175
Finally something that I wanna do,
that I'm proud of,

14:03.259 --> 14:05.678
that's gonna fucking represent us
in the right way, you know?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.930
This is, like, what I've been
fucking waiting for, man,

14:08.013 --> 14:09.223
-and I fucking love you.
-Yeah.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.849
And, like, we're back, man.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.518
-It's been worth the wait.
-God damn it!

14:12.601 --> 14:15.437
-Let's do it.
-Here we go. [laughs]

14:15.938 --> 14:17.690
Whoo! Shit!

14:18.274 --> 14:19.525
[door opens]

14:19.608 --> 14:22.194
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, babe.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.072
-[singsong] Making some tea?
-Mm-hmm.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.699
Oh, my God. Baby, you smell so bad.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.660
-[both laugh]
-Oh, come on!

14:29.743 --> 14:32.621
How do you expect me to leave Dark Matter
not reeking of weed?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.124
-[chuckles] That's not my fault.
-Oh, my God.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.251
Can I have a little bit?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.838
I meant some tea, but I'll take that, too.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.132
-Okay. Sorry.
-[both chuckle]

14:43.215 --> 14:44.633
How you doing? How was your day?

14:45.175 --> 14:46.802
It was good. I had the meeting.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.639
-Oh! Yeah, yeah. How was it?
-Um...

14:52.182 --> 14:53.475
It was...

14:54.059 --> 14:58.063
I met with the owner of the store
and then the distributor lady,

14:58.147 --> 14:59.189
and they were, like...

15:00.232 --> 15:01.275
I don't know. They were...

15:01.358 --> 15:05.029
They didn't set, like, a time of
when they would want anything, so...

15:05.571 --> 15:07.114
-So is it gonna happen?
-I don't know.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.116
-Or are we just... We don't know.
-I don't know.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.618
-Okay.
-Yeah.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.037
All right. Well, sounds... sounds good.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.706
[cell phone chimes and vibrates]

15:24.882 --> 15:27.259
-Hey.
-Hey, w hat's up?

15:27.343 --> 15:29.261
-How you doing?
-Good. I'm doing all right.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.763
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.389
Um...

15:33.349 --> 15:37.478
Hey, man, I just wanna say, I've been...
I've been thinking about things, and...

15:38.479 --> 15:41.774
I'm sorry, man,
for being in such a foul mood lately.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.401
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, we've all been stressed out.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.321
Yeah, but I was
with the Dark Matter guys earlier.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.491
Everyone's excited.
It's gonna be really fun.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.993
-Good, man. I'm glad.
-Yeah.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.622
[clears throat]
That's actually, that's why I...

15:56.705 --> 15:58.624
-I want you to have a good time with this.
-Yeah.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.626
With the Dark Matter guys.
I love that you're doing it.

16:00.709 --> 16:04.546
But this is gonna be the last
experiment beer that we do for a while.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.841
What? Why? What? What?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.803
Look, man, I'm out there,
I'm pounding the pavement,

16:10.886 --> 16:14.223
and I went to six places today,
and nobody wants it.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.559
Nobody wants it. They want the IPA.
I got a couple of bites on the lager,

16:17.643 --> 16:21.271
but, honestly,
it's gotta be it for a while.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.941
We just can't do it. We can't afford it.

16:24.024 --> 16:27.152
That's it, then?
Just, like, one bad day, and...

16:27.236 --> 16:29.321
and we can't make any new beer ever again?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.365
-Who cares, man?
-No, I'm not saying that.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.076
We'll do it the same way
the Half Acre guys did it and Rev did it.

16:34.159 --> 16:39.248
We'll make a couple of things really well,
and we'll do that until we get profitable,

16:39.331 --> 16:42.167
and then we can branch out,
do other stuff. That's just the way it is.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.336
That was almost ten years ago, okay?

16:44.420 --> 16:47.464
You're the one who always says it.
There's more breweries than ever, right?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.925
We need to do something
that's gonna make us stand out.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.720
If we do things like everyone else,
we're not gonna survive.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.346
Anyone could do the shit
we're doing now.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.975
People are buying the IPA, all right?
It's just the way it is.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.685
We need to be making more of it, anyway.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.770
We need the grain for the girls, so...

17:01.854 --> 17:04.106
-We just gotta push it on.
-What--

17:04.189 --> 17:06.108
What does that have to do with anything?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.236
-For the dog treats.
-Yeah, the dog--

17:09.319 --> 17:12.114
Who knows if that's gonna happen?
Let's deal with that when we have to.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.616
-It's not a thing right now.
-What are you talking about?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.036
They're gonna be in Chicago Fresh Markets
all over the city.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.955
What? No.
I, like, just talked to Noelle.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.957
She said it's not official yet,
so let's just...

17:22.041 --> 17:24.251
We'll talk about it when we need to,
when it's real.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.796
At the meeting today,
they placed a huge order.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.174
It's a done deal. That's happening.

17:30.758 --> 17:34.386
That's why we gotta...
We have to just lean into it, you know.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.556
The deal's done?
They're doing it? That's...

17:37.639 --> 17:38.474
Yeah.

17:41.351 --> 17:46.607
I'm excited for 'em, man. And we'll
get back to your beers down the road.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.736
I love your beers.
It sucks that we can't just go out and...

17:50.819 --> 17:52.571
and make whatever, but...

17:52.654 --> 17:55.866
It's just the way it's gotta be right now.
Just for a while.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.993
-Okay. All right, all right.
-Thanks.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.413
-[Jeff sniffles]
-[Matt sighs]

18:01.497 --> 18:03.248
[beer pouring]

18:06.668 --> 18:08.837
He's, like, two years down the line.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.756
Fucking five years,
ten years down the line.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.675
He's just gonna fucking spew out
his fucking bullshit, and...

18:13.759 --> 18:15.511
-And you're gonna be making IPAs...
-I know!

18:15.594 --> 18:17.054
-and double IPAs and triple IPAs...
-I know.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.306
and a couple two tree IPAs
and all of the IPAs.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.183
It's never gonna change, man.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.976
-I know, I know.
-Well, we can change it.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.480
We can go back to what it was,
what it always was supposed to be.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.981
Let's go back to being guerrilla.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.235
Let's go back to breaking the rules
and doing whatever the fuck we wanna do.

18:31.318 --> 18:35.364
Let's take this door off the wall,
put it back, go back in there.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.449
He's got all of the materials we need.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.409
-He's got everything.
-You're gonna take that door off the wall?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.161
Yeah, let's take it off the fucking wall!

18:41.245 --> 18:42.913
-It's just a couple of screws, man.
-Yeah.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.501
Let's do it. Got that thing tuned in.
Let's go brew some fucking beer.

18:47.584 --> 18:51.338
I'm trying to think of why not.
Yeah, I'm trying to think of why not.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.298
Is this the life I'm gonna fucking lead?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.260
I'm just gonna fucking keep doing
the same shit every single day?

18:56.343 --> 18:57.386
Like, this isn't me.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.264
I fucking said that
from day one, and I just...

19:00.347 --> 19:02.558
I got talked into
something that I'm not...

19:03.142 --> 19:05.894
I don't know, this-- Maybe, maybe.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.981
-Should we rip that door off the wall?
-Yeah.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.149
-Is that what we're doing?
-Yeah.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.026
Are you fucking serious, you guys?
I'm serious. Are you serious?

19:13.110 --> 19:16.321
Dude, let's rip it off the fucking wall,
and take it back.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.951
Okay. All right.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.912
Um... okay. Okay, okay.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.998
-Okay, okay. With me?
-Let's take it off the wall.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.167
Let's take it off the fucking wall.
Let's do it.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.626
You move, and I'll move.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.253
-You fucking move, I'll move.
-Let's go!

19:32.421 --> 19:33.922
-Let's go!
-Fuck!

19:35.591 --> 19:38.010
-Here.
-Give me that fucking screwdriver!

19:38.093 --> 19:40.095
I don't know why I'm holding a hammer.
Let's do it.

19:40.596 --> 19:45.601
Ready? One, two, three. Yes!

19:45.684 --> 19:46.602
[shouts]

19:46.685 --> 19:48.687
Watch it. It's no good to us broken.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.273
There it is. Almost too easy.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.775
Don't worry if you mess shit up.
Hit shit on the way.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.861
[shouts]

20:00.407 --> 20:02.951
-Go, go!
-Let's go, guys!

20:07.789 --> 20:09.249
Look.

20:09.333 --> 20:13.295
Last year with the brewery,
when you guys all got together

20:13.378 --> 20:15.547
and decided to do this thing
and didn't tell me

20:15.631 --> 20:21.094
and decided that I would be against it
or have problems with it...

20:21.178 --> 20:24.431
The issue that I had
was that nobody talked to me.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.058
Nobody included me.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.019
Nobody allowed me to have
any reaction that was positive

20:29.102 --> 20:32.689
because I heard about it,
you know, secondhand.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.318
And I feel like, if you just talk to him,

20:36.401 --> 20:39.529
he then is gonna have the reaction
he's gonna have, and you're already

20:39.613 --> 20:42.532
-anticipating it being negative.
-Yeah, I know.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.327
-So, look, it can't get any worse, right?
-Yeah.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.915
Like, the thought you have in your head
is the worst-case scenario.

20:50.499 --> 20:54.044
Maybe he'll surprise you.
Maybe he won't, but...

20:54.127 --> 20:55.545
it is something that we need to do

20:55.629 --> 20:59.383
to move forward,
and I know you want that. Right?

20:59.466 --> 21:00.884
I do. I really do.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.678
[all exclaiming]

21:02.761 --> 21:03.887
Okay.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.476
-[Jeff] We got it here! Let's go.
-Shit. All right.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.019
[Jeff] Get up there!

21:14.273 --> 21:16.441
-Whoo!
-Who wants beers?

21:16.525 --> 21:20.112
-Oh, God!
-It's a light time, it's a light time!

21:20.195 --> 21:21.321
[Jeff] We're home, boys!

21:21.405 --> 21:23.073
-Yeah.
-We're home!

21:24.908 --> 21:27.786
Gentlemen, I propose a toast.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.246
Yeah!

21:30.038 --> 21:32.791
Matt, fucking Matt,

21:32.874 --> 21:36.503
he says that that fucking monstrosity
is our garage.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.006
-That ain't our garage!
-No. That's not our fucking garage!

21:39.089 --> 21:42.968
-This! This is our garage!
-Yeah. Yeah!

21:43.051 --> 21:45.679
-This is who we are!
-Yeah.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.181
This is fucking where we're from!

21:48.265 --> 21:49.516
-Hell yeah!
-Yeah!

21:49.599 --> 21:51.351
We make beer for us!

21:51.435 --> 21:53.061
-Yes.
-And not for fucking them!

21:53.145 --> 21:54.771
-No, for us!
-No, for us!

21:54.855 --> 21:56.148
All right, hey, look.

21:56.231 --> 22:02.279
We are gonna put this fucking door back
on our garage!

22:02.362 --> 22:04.239
Yeah! Yes! Yes!

22:04.323 --> 22:05.365
Eventually!

22:05.449 --> 22:06.783
-We're not doing that now.
-In the morning.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.076
-We'll figure it out.
-Too much work!

22:08.160 --> 22:09.745
-It's gonna be good.
-We will put it up.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.955
-It's gonna be there.
-Hey, boys!

22:12.039 --> 22:15.417
To the fucking future. The future is now!

22:15.500 --> 22:17.336
Yeah!

22:19.880 --> 22:21.131
[vehicle alarm chiming]

22:24.468 --> 22:25.802
[metal clangs]

22:39.941 --> 22:41.109
Fuck.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.173
Hey, baby.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.550
Baby.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.721
-Mmm, hey.
-Hey, hey.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.057
Hey, where were you?

23:12.140 --> 23:14.726
I just-- I passed out at Russ's.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.645
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.106
Are you okay?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.650
Yeah, I just--

23:22.401 --> 23:24.236
[sighs] I don't know. I--

23:25.529 --> 23:29.658
I just-- I know--
I know I haven't been myself

23:29.741 --> 23:33.245
in a long time now,
and that's gonna change--

23:33.328 --> 23:36.414
No, no, listen. Listen.
That's gonna change. Okay?

23:36.498 --> 23:37.499
I wanna be here for you.

23:37.582 --> 23:40.961
I wanna support you,
and I love you more than anything,

23:41.044 --> 23:45.507
-and Matt told me about...
-What?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.175
-the Fresh Market deal.
-You kidding me?

23:47.259 --> 23:49.427
Baby, I was gonna tell you. I'm so sorry.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.096
No, don't apologize.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.765
I was gonna tell you,
just I thought you were gonna

23:53.849 --> 23:56.351
-get, like, mad or something.
-I know.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.436
And I put you in that position,
and I'm sorry.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.940
I'm so proud of you, and it's like,
how fucking cool is this?

24:02.023 --> 24:05.694
-I know. It's cool. I wanted to tell you.
-[both chuckle]

24:05.777 --> 24:08.738
-But I felt like...
-I know. Don't, don't. Yeah.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.366
And I don't know, like, if...

24:12.367 --> 24:16.538
if this means that you're gonna be
working full-time, then...

24:17.664 --> 24:21.209
I don't know,
maybe I'll stay home with Simone.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.920
-Babe, no, we can't do that.
-No, no, no. No.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.756
I've been thinking.
I've been thinking, and,

24:26.840 --> 24:29.384
I mean, clearly I'm miserable
at the brewery,

24:29.467 --> 24:31.887
and being with her,
that would make me happy.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.556
Especially if you can go out
and just kill it

24:34.639 --> 24:36.266
-and do your thing for us.
-You're sure about this?

24:36.349 --> 24:37.392
Yes.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.561
-Really?
-Yes, yes, really.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.190
-It means a lot that you say that.
-Yeah?

24:43.273 --> 24:44.274
I love you.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.625
[mutters] Fucking...

25:25.732 --> 25:27.150
[sighs]

25:31.613 --> 25:33.281
[machinery powering up]

25:42.958 --> 25:45.752
I think we just need to be very careful
with our communication,

25:45.835 --> 25:48.338
-and make sure we are on the same page.
-Yeah.

25:48.421 --> 25:51.675
Because I think it's, you know,
it's probably easier for us

25:51.758 --> 25:54.219
-'cause we're not actually related, so...
-Yeah. Yeah.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.929
-this is a choice.
-[laughing]

25:56.012 --> 25:59.641
I feel like we haven't necessarily had
the best examples.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.142
-Yeah.
-In terms of...

26:01.226 --> 26:05.188
-The boys have not done it super well.
-Family, yeah.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.316
But I feel like we've been, like...

26:09.192 --> 26:11.861
doing pretty well in that respect,
which...

26:12.320 --> 26:13.655
-I do, too.
-Yeah.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.116
-This is not in reference to any--
-Yeah, yeah, right.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.285
I'm not, like, secretly, like,
pissed at you

26:18.368 --> 26:21.705
for putting too much honey in
or anything silly like that.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.165
It's just, I think you're probably right.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.418
It's probably because of the boys,
and I wanna make sure

26:26.501 --> 26:28.920
-that, like, we take care of each other.
-Yeah.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.338
So, I will take care of you,

26:30.422 --> 26:31.715
-and you take care--
-And I'll take care of you.

26:31.798 --> 26:32.757
Yeah.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.303
-And I think we should do it.
-Yeah. Me, too.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.554
-Let's do it.
-Yeah.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.640
-We're business owners, baby.
-Yeah, we're business... Oh, my God.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.934
I don't think
I've ever called anyone "baby."

26:43.018 --> 26:44.477
[both laugh]

26:44.561 --> 26:46.271
[baby cooing]

26:50.275 --> 26:51.943
[Jeff chuckles]

26:54.404 --> 26:55.572
Yeah.
