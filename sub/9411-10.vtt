15:09.420 --> 15:10.860
Help!

15:12.340 --> 15:13.340
He's gone.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.900
We got to find him. 
 We got to find him!

15:17.900 --> 15:19.900
[ Panting ] 
 Look.

15:22.900 --> 15:23.900
Give me the bag.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.940
How are any of these 
 supposed to open the door.

15:33.940 --> 15:36.140
You just kind of 
 have to figure it out.

15:40.260 --> 15:41.700
We're trapped.

15:42.180 --> 15:47.100
Check this out. 
 "To reverse the effect use the 'un.'"

15:47.100 --> 15:49.380
Y-yes. 
 Before it was just a locket,

15:50.380 --> 15:52.380
now it's an un-locket.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.180
[ Latch Opens ]

16:00.180 --> 16:01.340
[ Gasps ]

16:03.220 --> 16:04.700
[ Creaking ]

16:17.300 --> 16:19.300
Hey, and there's another window.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.620
This is crazy. 
 We just came in from there.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.100
Told you this house was a puzzle.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.100
- I hate this house. 
 - I love it.

16:38.620 --> 16:42.260
- Come on. 
 - [ Jonathan ] This way.

16:48.860 --> 16:49.860
Give me the compass.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.340
Maybe the compass 
 will show us the way.

16:53.340 --> 16:55.860
A-a compass will only tell you 
 which way you're going,

16:55.860 --> 16:58.340
not the way out of 
 a stupid mansion of terror.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.340
Yes. But this isn't just 
 any normal compass.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.060
Look.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.060
It's pointing this way. 
 Come on.

17:09.619 --> 17:11.099
[ Nadine ] 
 This is it!

17:13.099 --> 17:17.099
- It's getting hot. 
 - [ Compass Whirring Rapidly ]

17:17.099 --> 17:19.099
[ All Gasping ]

17:21.619 --> 17:24.619
- Noah! 
 - What happened to you?

17:24.619 --> 17:25.619
I don't know.

17:25.619 --> 17:28.099
All I remember is being 
 pulled through the clothes

17:28.099 --> 17:29.620
and suddenly I'm walking 
 through the halls.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.340
- Look. 
 - [ Nadine ] The stairs!

17:33.340 --> 17:35.340
Come on, 
 we're almost out of this.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.700
[ Chuckling ]

17:42.460 --> 17:43.460
What's happening?

17:48.140 --> 17:51.100
- Now what do we do? 
 - Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

17:57.060 --> 17:59.060
[ All Screaming ]

18:10.620 --> 18:11.980
Come on.

18:14.540 --> 18:18.500
That's it. All we have to do is go 
 down the stairs and out that door.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.980
Let's go.

18:23.420 --> 18:24.340
[ Grunting ]

18:25.340 --> 18:27.180
[ All Gasping ]

18:27.860 --> 18:29.100
Oh, no!

18:33.740 --> 18:35.820
[ Both Cackling ]

18:39.500 --> 18:40.980
Where'd they come from?

18:41.580 --> 18:43.300
Round 1. Where else?

18:44.220 --> 18:46.700
- Throw it at them. 
 - [ All Chattering ]

18:47.100 --> 18:49.180
- [ All Moaning ] 
 - What happened?

18:49.180 --> 18:50.700
They're afraid of the flash.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.300
- Do it again. 
 - That's cheating.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.060
[ Wailing ]

18:58.500 --> 18:59.820
Let's go.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.100
[ Both Cackling ]

19:13.700 --> 19:16.780
You're not going anywhere.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.460
Now you're part of the game.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.300
[ Noah ] 
 Just like the ones before you.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.300
What are you talking about?

19:23.300 --> 19:25.940
Let us go. 
 We found our way out. We won.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.540
Sorry, you lose and I win.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.420
- You win? You cheated. 
 - Oh, I cheated?

19:32.420 --> 19:34.340
Like disappearing from the basement

19:34.340 --> 19:35.700
to get the ghosts 
 from the first round?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.140
You call that fair?

19:37.140 --> 19:40.220
I suppose, letting them 
 use the flash wasn't cheating?

19:40.220 --> 19:41.700
You're a sore loser.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.900
You bet me that they 
 couldn't find the front door

19:43.900 --> 19:45.900
and they did. So I win.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.900
Doesn't count if you cheat. 
 It isn't fair.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.420
It's a game, Noah. 
 Everything is fair.

19:50.420 --> 19:52.860
- What if they rolled a 7. 
 - The dice.

19:52.860 --> 19:56.020
- But they didn't. 
 - Give me the dice.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.620
Roll 'em!

20:01.020 --> 20:04.380
- [ Noah ] It's 7. 
 - [ Both Screaming ]

20:04.380 --> 20:07.860
Lucky 7. 
 Come on. Let's go.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.860
[ Girl ] 
 I lost my kitty-cat.

20:23.860 --> 20:26.860
The door was open 
 and it just ran right in.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.860
It's OK. 
 We'll go get it for you.

20:28.860 --> 20:32.860
- But, what if you can't find it? 
 - Don't worry. We'll find it.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.340
Wait here. 
 We'll be right back.
