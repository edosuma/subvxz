WEBVTT

00:02.409 --> 00:04.075
Whoa. It's a real live baby.

00:04.111 --> 00:06.145
Don't hold him like he's a live grenade.

00:06.846 --> 00:07.846
Me and babies, not so much.

00:11.118 --> 00:12.185
We're on a high priority mission

00:12.219 --> 00:15.288
to get this man to a CDC lab in California.

00:15.322 --> 00:17.690
Can't worry about some raggedy
ass group of civilians.

00:17.724 --> 00:21.027
Nothing raggedy ass about
this group of civilians, sir.

00:21.061 --> 00:22.195
Relax.

00:22.229 --> 00:23.563
Garnett and Warren know what they're doing.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.992 --> 00:52.792
There you are.

00:52.826 --> 00:55.061
Ah, thank you, honey.

00:56.530 --> 01:00.166
Mmmm-mmm. Nothing like the first cup.

01:03.837 --> 01:06.272
I will see your vicodin

01:06.306 --> 01:08.274
and raise you one tetracycline.

01:09.109 --> 01:10.042
Call.

01:11.745 --> 01:13.346
Three of a kind.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.714
Full house.

01:14.748 --> 01:16.215
Aces high.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.183
Man.

01:17.217 --> 01:19.285
That's five hands in a row.

01:19.319 --> 01:21.921
If you're gonna continue to use <i> my</i> deck

01:21.955 --> 01:24.023
you need to quit pulling cards out your ass.

01:24.057 --> 01:25.124
Oh boo hoo.

01:25.158 --> 01:27.960
Hey shhh. Hold on, he's back on.

01:27.995 --> 01:30.897
Friends, I'm talking about
mean weather coming in fast.

01:30.931 --> 01:32.365
Some reports of tornados.

01:32.399 --> 01:33.933
Find shelter and take cover.

01:33.967 --> 01:36.502
It's dangerous out there.
More so than usual.

01:36.537 --> 01:40.673
Now back to the soothing
sounds of the Apocalypse.

01:45.045 --> 01:47.380
You know after he was so
wrong about that chopper

01:47.414 --> 01:51.117
weatherman's a pretty
good job for that geek.

01:51.142 --> 01:51.842
You're up.

01:51.876 --> 01:52.843
All good?

01:52.877 --> 01:53.944
Peaceful night.

01:53.979 --> 01:55.846
Your stalker said there's
a storm front coming in.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.748
How is it out there?

01:57.782 --> 01:59.583
Cloudy with a chance of zombie.

01:59.618 --> 02:01.785
Okay, you two get some rest.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.854
You got it.

02:14.332 --> 02:16.533
I've had worse days.

02:16.568 --> 02:18.569
It's not a bad set up.

02:18.603 --> 02:20.671
Mmm-hmmm.

02:26.578 --> 02:27.878
You know,

02:27.912 --> 02:30.514
I'm really starting to feel at home here.

02:30.548 --> 02:32.283
I'm thinking about putting
a barbecue right here.

02:34.819 --> 02:37.721
This one needs to be flipped.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.035
I really like what they did with
the landscaping, the flowers,

02:51.069 --> 02:53.237
everything. So homey.

02:53.271 --> 02:56.540
Yeah. Too bad they're dead.

02:56.574 --> 02:57.641
Yeah.

03:02.747 --> 03:03.714
Okay.

03:06.084 --> 03:07.985
Sorry. Wrong room.

03:08.019 --> 03:10.788
Okay.

03:10.822 --> 03:15.826
Oh my God. A bed.
When was the last time we did it in a bed?

03:17.095 --> 03:19.129
What do you think?

03:19.164 --> 03:20.597
Naked?

03:20.632 --> 03:22.299
Like no clothes?

03:24.502 --> 03:25.703
Full commando, baby.

03:25.737 --> 03:27.771
Oh my God, you are such a romantic.

03:46.524 --> 03:47.124
The...

03:47.292 --> 03:48.258
blanket...

03:48.493 --> 03:49.693
I was just...

03:50.829 --> 03:52.429
Sorry.

03:56.401 --> 03:57.901
Scared of that one.

03:57.936 --> 04:00.137
Best not to mess.

04:00.171 --> 04:04.441
You know if we breed those two,
it'd be all over for the zombies

04:10.048 --> 04:13.851
Can't remember the last time
I snuck off with somebody.

04:13.885 --> 04:16.853
I can't remember the last time I wanted to.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.102
You still think about him?

04:32.137 --> 04:33.670
Antoine?

04:34.706 --> 04:36.206
I try not to.

04:36.241 --> 04:40.911
And I never heard what happened,
so there's not much point.

04:40.945 --> 04:42.880
What about you?

04:42.914 --> 04:46.316
I used to think about Amy
and the kids everyday.

04:46.351 --> 04:50.521
Every time I closed my eyes,
I saw the end all over again.

04:50.555 --> 04:53.557
It got to a certain point
where I just gave up.

04:53.591 --> 04:56.393
Didn't care if I lived or died.

04:56.428 --> 04:58.896
And a funny thing happened.

04:59.564 --> 05:01.365
I didn't die.

05:03.067 --> 05:06.403
And with everything that's happened

05:06.438 --> 05:10.340
it's been harder and harder
to remember the past.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.409
I guess that's a good thing, right?

05:13.845 --> 05:15.679
Guess so.

05:17.715 --> 05:20.584
Are we close by your hometown?

05:21.586 --> 05:24.221
I know what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

05:24.255 --> 05:25.956
Just swing by on our way west.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.892
Why? It's long gone.

05:28.927 --> 05:30.527
He's gone.

05:33.264 --> 05:37.968
And I just wish that I
would've waited for him

05:38.002 --> 05:42.539
and said goodbye before the
last time I got shipped out.

05:42.574 --> 05:45.342
Don't you want to know for sure?

05:45.376 --> 05:49.379
You can't start forgetting
what you don't know.

05:53.351 --> 05:55.819
That does not look good.

05:55.854 --> 05:57.221
It's tornado weather.

06:13.705 --> 06:15.539
That was close.

06:24.782 --> 06:26.283
Hey,

06:26.317 --> 06:27.818
hey.

06:27.852 --> 06:29.186
Are you okay?

06:29.754 --> 06:31.555
Uh, yeah.

06:32.023 --> 06:32.890
No.

06:33.925 --> 06:35.526
No, I dunno.

06:56.147 --> 06:57.347
Incoming!

07:03.187 --> 07:05.455
Puppies and kittens! Time to go!

07:06.424 --> 07:09.426
Everybody out the back!

07:22.240 --> 07:24.007
I give you mercy.

07:30.481 --> 07:32.683
<i>♪ Have Mercy</i>

I hate blind spots, boy.

07:57.141 --> 07:58.508
Make me anxious.

07:58.543 --> 08:00.310
Mess with my digestion.

08:03.748 --> 08:06.183
That was funny.

08:19.597 --> 08:21.565
Sorry, I forgot you.

08:29.207 --> 08:31.508
Oh that's right, you're on the wagon.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.710
Sorry, I forgot.

08:33.745 --> 08:38.181
The only thing worse than
drinking alone is not drinking.

08:44.188 --> 08:46.923
Hello, beautiful.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.191
What are we looking at here?

09:00.705 --> 09:01.905
Wow.

09:01.939 --> 09:04.307
Dang.
They don't call it Tornado Alley for nothing.

09:04.776 --> 09:06.777
I am not drunk.

09:06.811 --> 09:07.477
You're drunk.

09:07.512 --> 09:10.614
No, your mom's drunk.

09:24.729 --> 09:27.764
In our
continuing effort to bring you

09:27.799 --> 09:30.300
up to the minute information,
we at Z-TV have acquired

09:30.334 --> 09:32.302
a National Weather Service satellite

09:32.336 --> 09:33.970
that they aren't using anymore.

09:34.005 --> 09:35.505
But that's not important.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.308
We now go to John Smith,
southern weather correspondent

09:38.342 --> 09:41.311
to get his opinion on the story.

09:41.345 --> 09:44.715
This is the badassest
storm this weatherman has ever seen.

09:44.749 --> 09:47.951
From the Gulf of Mexico right
up the Mississippi Valley,

09:47.985 --> 09:49.252
trouble is brewing.

09:49.287 --> 09:52.923
I don't know if they call this
thing a turricane or a tornado

09:52.957 --> 09:55.158
or what.
But if you're anywhere south of Chicago

09:55.193 --> 09:56.426
or east of the Rockies,

09:56.461 --> 10:00.764
I'm issuing a get your
butt in a bunker warning.

10:01.132 --> 10:03.734
Hey,
I hope you guys are getting this.

10:03.768 --> 10:05.168
Addy and friends.

10:05.203 --> 10:07.571
You guys got to seek
shelter immediately because

10:07.605 --> 10:10.607
this is bad. And

10:10.641 --> 10:12.509
when you seek shelter immediately

10:12.543 --> 10:13.577
and after you do that,

10:13.611 --> 10:16.246
you need to contact me
and tell me where you are.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.417
And I'll update you with
further instructions. Okay?

10:20.451 --> 10:24.254
All right, well this is Citizen Z,
and I'm signing off.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.958
Who's Addy?

10:28.826 --> 10:29.993
So which way do we go?

10:30.027 --> 10:31.595
The storm is pushing north from the gulf.

10:31.629 --> 10:33.330
If we make it to the I-70, we can outrun it.

10:33.364 --> 10:35.966
That storm is going faster than
that craptastic truck ever will.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.735
Yeah, we got to get off the road.
You heard Citizen Z.

10:38.770 --> 10:39.736
We got to seek shelter.

10:39.771 --> 10:41.338
What we need is to get the hell out of here.

10:41.372 --> 10:44.307
I ain't stopping just cuz some
punk with a satellite says so.

10:44.342 --> 10:47.277
Okay, hang on.
Am I missing something?

10:47.311 --> 10:49.489
You did not drag my ass this far

10:49.589 --> 10:52.396
so that mankind's hope could
get sucked up by a tornado,

10:52.496 --> 10:53.163
did you?

10:55.900 --> 10:57.567
Hey, Addy.

10:57.601 --> 10:58.735
You know you've been quiet.

10:58.769 --> 11:01.304
Just want to make sure you're okay.

11:01.672 --> 11:03.206
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.541
Just,

11:04.575 --> 11:06.509
you know, zombies.

11:14.318 --> 11:15.885
Anybody got a mint?

11:32.370 --> 11:35.705
Castle Point. That's your hometown right?

11:43.948 --> 11:46.449
Whoa. Look at that storm coming in.

11:46.484 --> 11:50.053
Okay, fine. You win.

12:15.012 --> 12:17.847
Welcome home, Roberta.

12:20.084 --> 12:22.085
So you know this town?

12:22.119 --> 12:24.320
Born and raised here.

12:47.311 --> 12:48.945
We need to take cover.

12:48.979 --> 12:50.747
Is there someplace safe nearby?

12:50.781 --> 12:53.249
Yeah, there's a storm cellar in my house.

12:53.284 --> 12:54.717
How close by is your house?

12:54.752 --> 12:56.286
It's not far.

12:57.922 --> 12:59.923
I knew these people.

12:59.957 --> 13:02.192
My neighbor.

13:02.226 --> 13:04.894
My boss.

13:04.929 --> 13:06.930
My...

13:11.669 --> 13:13.603
Is that him?

13:17.308 --> 13:18.808
Who's him?

13:20.077 --> 13:21.778
Oh, no.

13:21.812 --> 13:26.616
No. We are not here searching for dead hubby,
are we?

13:27.318 --> 13:28.218
Let's go.

13:28.252 --> 13:30.153
Shelter's this way.

13:33.991 --> 13:36.426
Get going.

13:36.827 --> 13:38.328
It's so green.

13:38.362 --> 13:40.330
I never seen a sky look like that.

13:40.364 --> 13:42.499
I've only seen tornadoes on TV.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.100
I don't like tornadoes.

13:44.134 --> 13:47.003
I'm pretty sure they don't like me either.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.471
That it?

14:22.540 --> 14:24.374
That's it.

14:25.609 --> 14:28.244
10K, come on!

14:35.386 --> 14:38.054
Come on!

14:50.334 --> 14:51.968
If he's in there and he's...

14:52.002 --> 14:53.803
I will not hesitate.

15:38.115 --> 15:41.250
Home sweet zombie.

15:41.986 --> 15:43.653
Get out of that chair!

15:43.687 --> 15:45.388
Go on and get out of there!

15:45.422 --> 15:48.224
That's my husband's favorite chair!

15:48.258 --> 15:50.493
All right.

15:53.130 --> 15:55.264
Uh, upstairs is all good.

16:01.005 --> 16:02.171
I got this.

16:14.351 --> 16:15.718
Please don't shoot us.

16:15.753 --> 16:17.253
My husband is hurt.

16:18.622 --> 16:20.657
What are you doing in my house?

16:20.924 --> 16:24.394
The fireman said we'd be safe here.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.871
Here we go.

16:34.905 --> 16:36.239
Bark like a dog for me.

16:37.341 --> 16:40.443
Well I wasn't talking to you,
but I'm impressed.

16:41.846 --> 16:44.648
God.

16:44.682 --> 16:47.651
From a Category Three to
the Seventh Circle of Hell.

16:47.685 --> 16:51.321
Delta-Xray-Delta,
I hope you guys aren't underneath that.

16:51.355 --> 16:53.790
Come on. Drop me a note.

16:53.824 --> 16:56.259
Send up a flare. Give me a ring.

16:56.294 --> 16:58.595
I can't help you if I can't find you.

17:01.399 --> 17:02.999
You're going to be okay.

17:03.034 --> 17:04.867
He's a doctor.

17:04.902 --> 17:05.902
Uh,

17:05.935 --> 17:08.438
well they sorta just call me Doc.

17:08.472 --> 17:09.873
No.

17:09.906 --> 17:13.009
No doctor. I just... need a nap.

17:13.044 --> 17:15.478
Oh that, no that wouldn't be good, dude.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.513
Do not nap.

17:17.548 --> 17:21.518
Don't let him fall asleep.
He's got a bad concussion at least.

17:21.551 --> 17:23.920
Rick? Rick?

17:23.954 --> 17:25.488
Help him!

17:28.592 --> 17:29.859
Basement's clear.

17:30.861 --> 17:32.662
Is he gonna be okay?

17:34.799 --> 17:35.932
Is this the fireman?

17:35.966 --> 17:36.766
What?

17:38.235 --> 17:40.670
Is this the fireman that brought you here?

17:40.705 --> 17:42.238
I don't know.

17:42.273 --> 17:44.541
Maybe. He was wearing a helmet.

17:46.444 --> 17:48.411
Maybe it's him.

17:48.446 --> 17:49.779
I think it is.

17:52.516 --> 17:53.783
Thank you.

18:09.166 --> 18:12.268
We need to get out of here
before this storm hits.

18:12.703 --> 18:17.025
And go where, huh?

18:17.059 --> 18:18.026
What are we supposed to do,
just sit heres cure.

18:18.060 --> 18:19.528
We can ride it out down there.

18:19.562 --> 18:22.464
Let's just gather some
supplies before it hits.

18:22.498 --> 18:24.266
Kitchen was pretty well stocked up.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.600
There's water and canned food.

18:25.635 --> 18:27.602
No medical supplies, no batteries though.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.271
We need to get our communications up.

18:29.305 --> 18:30.872
You two, go out in the neighborhood.

18:30.907 --> 18:32.874
See what you can find. But don't go far.

18:32.909 --> 18:34.976
Be sure to get back before the storm hits.

18:35.311 --> 18:39.114
Janey what are all these people doing here?

18:39.148 --> 18:41.783
My parents will be home
for dinner any minute.

18:43.085 --> 18:44.119
Is he gonna make it?

18:44.587 --> 18:46.788
Is that a serious question?

18:46.823 --> 18:47.522
I don't know.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.257
He got cracked on the dome.

18:49.292 --> 18:50.392
Okay, I for one

18:50.426 --> 18:52.527
do not want to be trapped
in a basement with this guy

18:52.562 --> 18:54.396
when he starts craving brains.

18:55.698 --> 18:57.065
Don't mind him.

18:57.099 --> 18:59.367
His mama didn't raise him right.

18:59.402 --> 19:02.571
Well if I had the proper
meds or a first aid kit...

19:02.605 --> 19:06.575
You know the fire station may
still have first aid supplies.

19:06.609 --> 19:08.677
Hey,

19:08.711 --> 19:09.744
lock down the basement.

19:09.779 --> 19:12.247
If that kid turns,
I want you to be right on that.

19:12.281 --> 19:13.515
Yeah, of course.

19:13.549 --> 19:16.885
Keep an eye on Murphy.
We'll be back before the party starts.

19:33.102 --> 19:34.636
Addy!

19:34.670 --> 19:35.003
Addy!

19:39.342 --> 19:39.975
Hey!

19:40.009 --> 19:40.775
What?

19:40.810 --> 19:42.177
What?

19:42.211 --> 19:43.111
What?

20:29.525 --> 20:33.795
This place brings back so many memories.

20:36.966 --> 20:38.199
What?!

20:38.234 --> 20:39.701
My first kiss.

20:39.735 --> 20:41.036
With the fireman?

20:41.070 --> 20:42.170
Antoine, yeah.

20:42.204 --> 20:42.938
Look out!

20:45.574 --> 20:48.176
I totally forgot about that kiss until now!

20:49.612 --> 20:51.012
That must have been some kiss!

20:52.248 --> 20:53.815
It was more than just a kiss!

20:53.849 --> 20:55.717
It was a kiss that explained things

20:56.585 --> 20:58.486
We couldn't seem to say to each other!

20:59.956 --> 21:01.456
Look who's the big romantic!

21:03.759 --> 21:06.027
I think that's the first
personal story you ever told me!

21:06.062 --> 21:07.996
I loved that boy.

21:09.699 --> 21:10.999
This way.

21:28.117 --> 21:31.386
Doesn't look like anybody's
been here for a while.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.887
Sorry.

21:35.524 --> 21:38.259
Let's find what we can and get out of here.

21:39.028 --> 21:42.564
First aid kits look good.

21:46.669 --> 21:48.837
Hardly touched.

21:48.871 --> 21:50.171
Even some morphine.

21:50.206 --> 21:51.840
Don't tell Doc.

22:03.019 --> 22:05.754
You know he could still
be around here somewhere.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.390
Yeah.

22:10.459 --> 22:14.996
I sent this after the Battle
of New Jersey two years ago.

22:15.031 --> 22:18.033
Closest we got to a goodbye.

22:19.068 --> 22:22.437
I deployed while he was on duty.

22:23.472 --> 22:26.074
I should've waited for him to get home.

22:26.108 --> 22:27.042
Look.

22:29.578 --> 22:33.014
Someone's living in your house.
The pantry's stocked.

22:33.049 --> 22:35.950
That couple said they met a fireman.

22:39.188 --> 22:40.455
There's a chance he's...

22:43.059 --> 22:44.492
That life is gone.

22:45.528 --> 22:47.562
I've known that for a long time.

22:59.275 --> 23:00.575
We don't have much time.

23:02.311 --> 23:04.345
Shelter! Now!

23:50.311 --> 23:51.044
Pick your poison.

23:51.079 --> 23:52.713
It's safer in here than out there.

23:52.747 --> 23:54.648
Okay. Do you see him?

23:54.682 --> 23:56.450
It's the living against the dead now.

23:56.484 --> 23:57.684
All right.

23:57.719 --> 23:58.886
I'm out.

23:58.920 --> 23:59.653
Me too.

24:18.606 --> 24:20.073
Behind you.

24:32.921 --> 24:33.654
Antoine?

24:33.688 --> 24:34.588
Look out!

24:43.298 --> 24:44.598
Antoine.

24:44.632 --> 24:45.432
Is that him?

24:46.234 --> 24:46.733
No.

24:48.569 --> 24:50.304
No, it's his best friend,

24:50.805 --> 24:53.407
Dearborn.

24:53.441 --> 24:55.108
Matt Dearborn.

24:56.144 --> 24:57.911
Here.

24:57.946 --> 24:58.712
Thanks.

24:58.746 --> 24:59.713
Yeah.

25:19.934 --> 25:21.101
Easy now.

25:21.135 --> 25:22.602
Sorry.

25:22.637 --> 25:25.038
Tell those frat boys out
there to turn down the death metal.

25:25.073 --> 25:26.306
I'll call the cops again.

25:26.341 --> 25:27.174
I'll tell them.

25:28.242 --> 25:29.810
The dude's brain is getting
crushed by the swelling.

25:29.844 --> 25:31.778
We need to relieve the pressure.

25:31.813 --> 25:33.146
Great. How we gonna do that?

25:33.181 --> 25:34.548
Uh, I don't know exactly. But...

25:34.582 --> 25:36.650
But I saw this once on an episode of ER.

25:36.684 --> 25:39.319
We need to drain the blood out I think.

25:39.354 --> 25:41.688
So I need something sharp and pointy to...

25:41.723 --> 25:43.457
Like a corkscrew, an ice pick?

25:43.491 --> 25:44.825
Murphy!

25:44.859 --> 25:47.060
Murphy? A little help.

25:47.095 --> 25:47.961
Damn it.

25:48.997 --> 25:50.230
Murphy!

25:51.265 --> 25:53.066
What the hell, man?

25:53.101 --> 25:54.167
Murphy!

25:54.202 --> 25:56.103
The world's coming apart around us, man.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.038
And you decide it's time for a haircut?

25:58.072 --> 26:00.440
Keep him away from Rick!

26:00.475 --> 26:01.708
Murphy, I need your help.

26:01.743 --> 26:04.811
Find something sharp to penetrate his skull.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.281
Sharp enough to penetrate his skull. Got it.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.649
About time we piked him.

26:09.684 --> 26:11.151
What is he talking about?!

26:11.185 --> 26:12.352
Way to read the room!

26:12.387 --> 26:13.920
What is he talking about?

26:13.955 --> 26:17.090
Don't, don't worry.
Nobody's gonna pike your husband.

26:17.658 --> 26:18.158
Where's Addy?

26:18.192 --> 26:19.026
Addy!

26:33.641 --> 26:35.308
Addy? Addy?

26:35.343 --> 26:37.077
What, what is this?

26:38.546 --> 26:40.447
I don't know.

26:40.481 --> 26:43.016
I don't know.

26:44.752 --> 26:47.587
Mack! I need you, man!

26:47.622 --> 26:49.122
- Go.
- All right.

26:53.561 --> 26:56.129
How we doin' Murphy?!

27:00.535 --> 27:01.968
Thanks.

27:02.003 --> 27:03.203
Okay.

27:03.237 --> 27:05.005
Just hold him still.

27:05.773 --> 27:09.176
Now look, if this works right
there could be a lot of blood.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.377
But that's good.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.479
That's a good thing because we
want to relieve the pressure.

27:12.513 --> 27:15.882
And then that way the
brain will have room to...

27:15.917 --> 27:17.017
Don't watch.

27:27.762 --> 27:29.196
Oh damn.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.831
I knew this was gonna happen.

27:30.865 --> 27:32.232
Oh...

27:32.266 --> 27:34.401
Don't look at me... doctor.

27:38.106 --> 27:39.840
Jeez, kid.

27:39.874 --> 27:42.209
As a hammer. A hammer.

27:42.243 --> 27:42.909
Oh.

27:42.944 --> 27:44.111
That's good.

27:52.487 --> 27:53.620
Oh God.

27:55.623 --> 27:57.424
Well I guess that relieved the pressure.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.158
Is this gonna work?

27:58.192 --> 27:59.192
I don't know.

27:59.227 --> 28:00.961
I didn't see the end of the episode.

28:00.995 --> 28:03.763
He's gonna be all right.
I know it. I know it.

28:03.798 --> 28:05.765
Here. Just apply pressure.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.267
Just like that.

28:14.980 --> 28:16.180
Troy.

28:18.617 --> 28:20.118
Vince.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.256
Mike.

28:27.392 --> 28:29.026
And Dearborn.

28:29.461 --> 28:31.395
I give you mercy.

28:31.430 --> 28:34.599
May God give you peace.

28:37.970 --> 28:39.036
You ready?

28:39.404 --> 28:41.572
Let's take it to 'em.

28:53.051 --> 28:54.752
Where'd they all go?

29:02.494 --> 29:04.495
Come on. Let's go.

29:09.701 --> 29:11.169
That's good.

29:11.537 --> 29:12.870
That's good.

29:13.238 --> 29:14.805
Maybe I should've pulled the drill bit

29:14.840 --> 29:16.941
while he was still knocked out.

29:43.168 --> 29:44.669
Roberta!

29:49.775 --> 29:51.342
Does that thing look mad to you?

29:53.011 --> 29:54.345
Is that what I think?

29:57.382 --> 29:58.950
They ain't sharks!

30:17.202 --> 30:19.470
Really, God?! Really?!

30:22.674 --> 30:24.542
Now! We got to get inside!

30:32.017 --> 30:33.517
Come on! There's no time!

30:33.552 --> 30:35.353
Let's go!

30:57.142 --> 30:58.776
Murphy, take care of that zombie!

30:59.411 --> 31:00.578
Get it, Doc!

31:05.017 --> 31:05.516
How is he?

31:05.550 --> 31:06.450
I don't know.

31:06.485 --> 31:07.285
What did you do?

31:07.319 --> 31:09.253
Oh, decompressive craniectomy.

31:09.288 --> 31:10.321
I put a drill to the dome.

31:10.355 --> 31:10.988
Oh.

31:11.023 --> 31:12.323
Where's 10K and Cassandra?

31:12.357 --> 31:12.957
I don't know.

31:12.991 --> 31:13.958
Warren!

31:16.228 --> 31:17.428
Murphy! What are you doing?!

31:17.462 --> 31:19.163
Pike that thing now!

31:24.836 --> 31:26.570
We're not gonna make it back! Take shelter!

31:26.605 --> 31:28.306
Run for the car!

32:12.718 --> 32:14.685
Roberta!

32:14.720 --> 32:15.286
Roberta!

32:16.121 --> 32:17.822
Roberta!

32:18.523 --> 32:20.624
Roberta! What are you doing?!

32:21.326 --> 32:23.794
Roberta!
Can you hear me?!

32:24.830 --> 32:26.522
Please don't do this!

32:36.264 --> 32:37.264
What are you doing?

32:38.412 --> 32:39.845
The storm's gonna come any second!

32:39.880 --> 32:41.213
Come on! Hurry up!

32:42.082 --> 32:44.050
Come on, Roberta!

32:44.084 --> 32:47.453
Roberta! What are you doing, Roberta?!
Open the door!

32:57.064 --> 33:00.132
Mack, help me get him under the table,
will ya?

33:00.901 --> 33:01.467
Okay.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.234
On my count.

33:02.269 --> 33:03.502
Shut up, Doc.

33:04.705 --> 33:05.771
Get the blankets.

33:20.854 --> 33:22.755
Roberta! Can you hear me?!

33:22.789 --> 33:25.925
I have to wait for him this time, Charlie.

33:27.628 --> 33:30.129
I owe him that much.

33:30.163 --> 33:32.898
No. No! Goddamn it! Come down right now!

33:32.933 --> 33:35.434
It is not safe up here!

33:35.802 --> 33:38.104
It's like you said.

33:38.138 --> 33:40.339
I can't start forgetting...

33:41.208 --> 33:42.875
until I know.

33:44.711 --> 33:46.712
Roberta, please don't do this.

34:02.896 --> 34:05.464
Got it. That's it!

34:11.804 --> 34:13.005
Where's Warren?

34:13.040 --> 34:14.273
She's not coming.

34:14.306 --> 34:15.174
What?

34:15.208 --> 34:16.542
What?

34:16.576 --> 34:17.710
She's not coming?

34:17.744 --> 34:18.944
She's gonna get killed out there.

34:18.978 --> 34:20.179
She's got to get down here.

34:20.213 --> 34:21.547
She's not coming.

34:25.552 --> 34:26.952
Murphy.

34:26.987 --> 34:28.219
You kidding me?

34:28.255 --> 34:29.422
Quit screwing around with this thing.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.780
Mercy.

34:41.418 --> 34:41.851
10K.

34:41.885 --> 34:42.518
Okay.

34:42.552 --> 34:43.886
Hang on.

34:49.493 --> 34:51.726
Oh no! Oh no!

35:05.275 --> 35:07.143
Oh God.

36:03.166 --> 36:04.367
I waited for you.

36:52.119 --> 36:54.120
Well that was fun.

36:55.422 --> 36:56.623
Warren.

37:02.896 --> 37:04.897
You don't look so good, chief.

37:05.532 --> 37:07.667
I need to get out of here.

37:09.370 --> 37:12.071
I need to get out of here now.

37:23.350 --> 37:24.951
Roberta!

37:24.985 --> 37:26.252
Roberta!

37:28.288 --> 37:28.955
Hey.

37:29.289 --> 37:29.956
Hey.

37:30.724 --> 37:31.391
Hey.

37:32.393 --> 37:33.693
Hi, Charlie.

37:34.728 --> 37:36.129
Why didn't you...

37:37.965 --> 37:39.932
How did you...

37:41.068 --> 37:42.835
I tried to go home.

37:43.570 --> 37:44.971
I did.

37:47.107 --> 37:48.941
But I'm still here.

37:49.677 --> 37:51.411
Thank God you are.

37:52.946 --> 37:54.447
I'm still here.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.297
You're crazy.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.165
Yeah.

38:12.199 --> 38:13.166
You're crazy. You know that, right?

38:13.200 --> 38:14.967
A little bit, yeah.

38:30.217 --> 38:32.285
Warren.

38:32.319 --> 38:36.189
Oh. Thank you.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.493
Thank you.

38:55.442 --> 38:59.378
Man... If I see a munchkin, I'm gonna freak.

39:03.417 --> 39:05.418
I need to go!

39:05.452 --> 39:08.254
I'm not sure if I care for that look.

39:08.278 --> 39:10.014
Nobody ask to.

39:10.414 --> 39:11.347
New haircut.

39:11.381 --> 39:13.349
Same Murphy.

39:15.285 --> 39:17.253
Hey, Doc. Thanks.

39:17.621 --> 39:20.089
Thank yo tr...

39:22.793 --> 39:25.094
Do you have anything for the pain?

39:25.462 --> 39:26.662
Oh, I...

39:27.965 --> 39:30.066
I am so sorry.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.635
I wish I did.

39:35.505 --> 39:37.273
Oh, hell.

39:37.674 --> 39:38.040
Here.

39:41.144 --> 39:46.012
Take it easy on those, that's good stuff.

39:46.183 --> 39:48.575
Are you folks gonna be all right?

39:48.675 --> 39:50.743
Rick's got family nearby.

39:50.777 --> 39:53.079
We're gonna keep looking for them.

39:53.113 --> 39:54.380
But thanks.

39:54.414 --> 39:55.681
Thanks for everything.

40:03.824 --> 40:04.490
What?

40:06.426 --> 40:09.462
You were right. I did need to come back.

40:09.496 --> 40:13.132
Even if I never know for sure
what happened to Antoine,

40:13.166 --> 40:15.801
I said my goodbye.

40:15.836 --> 40:19.572
I know I'm okay with being here now.

40:19.606 --> 40:20.706
With you.

40:23.443 --> 40:26.112
And I'm good with that too.

40:32.719 --> 40:34.220
I always wanted to do that.

40:34.254 --> 40:36.055
I could tell.

40:46.366 --> 40:49.335
Survivors of the world,
hello.

40:49.369 --> 40:53.072
If you're hearing this, congrats.
You're still alive.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.609
You are the baddest of the badasses.

40:56.643 --> 41:00.846
Fearing neither man nor
twister nor living dead.

41:03.183 --> 41:05.751
My headset is off to you.
