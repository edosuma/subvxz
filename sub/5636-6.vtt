WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.160
Geez, I can't believe we found
a version of Earth

00:04.254 --> 00:06.495
with a "Ball Fondlers"
movie franchise.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.628
I can't believe the things
this reality considers PG-13.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.380
- Yeah, I-I'm pretty jealous.
- Don't be, Morty.

00:12.471 --> 00:15.304
There's pros and cons
to every alternate timeline.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.551
Fun facts
about this one --

00:16.642 --> 00:18.053
It's got giant,
telepathic spiders,

00:18.143 --> 00:19.383
11 9/11s,

00:19.478 --> 00:21.469
and the best ice cream
in the multiverse!

00:21.563 --> 00:23.145
- Shut up!
- Whoa!

00:23.232 --> 00:25.690
We're gonna go get
some ice cream, motherfucker!

00:27.736 --> 00:29.022
Oh, great.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.773
Oh, boy.
W-What's wrong, Rick?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.445
Is it the quantum carburetor
or something?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.524
"Quantum carburetor"?
Jesus, Morty.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.529
You can't just add
a s-- sci-fi word

00:36.620 --> 00:38.531
to a car word
and hope it means something.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.034
Looks like something's wrong
with the microverse battery.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.660
We're gonna have
to go inside.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.287
Um, go inside what?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.164
The battery, Morty.
Be right back, Summer.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.666
Stay put,
don't touch any buttons,

00:47.756 --> 00:50.669
and ignore all random thoughts
that feel... spidery.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.341
Wait!
You can't leave me here!

00:52.427 --> 00:53.633
You'll be fine.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.210
Ship,
keep Summer safe.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.387
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

00:57.474 --> 00:59.010
Ohh!

01:00.185 --> 01:01.846
Ugh.
Wonderful.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.273
Hey, excuse me.
Hello.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.317
Um...

01:10.404 --> 01:12.315
What, you think
you're better than me?!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.397
Nobody's better
than me!

01:14.491 --> 01:15.652
Hey!
Hey!

01:19.913 --> 01:21.745
Aah!
Aaaaah!

01:21.832 --> 01:23.573
- <i>Keep Summer safe.</i>
- Aaaaaaah!

01:23.667 --> 01:24.782
Hey, man,
what the hell?!

01:24.876 --> 01:26.583
That was my daughter's
pediatrician! Aah!

01:26.670 --> 01:28.377
No, stop!
Don't kill him!

01:28.463 --> 01:29.703
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:31.254
Aah!

01:32.467 --> 01:34.128
Oh, god.
I can't feel my legs.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.380
Help!
Help!!

01:35.470 --> 01:36.710
<i>Summer is safe.</i>

01:36.805 --> 01:38.716
I don't feel safe.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.138
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:40.225 --> 01:42.182
No.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.725
Oh, god, help me.
Help me!

01:43.812 --> 01:45.849
Help me, please!
You can help me!

01:45.939 --> 01:48.806
♪♪

02:19.264 --> 02:21.050
Oh, man.
Where are we, Rick?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.178
Morty, remember eight
seconds ago when -- you said,

02:23.268 --> 02:25.726
"go inside what?"
And I said, "the battery"?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.394
Then we showed up here,
and I wasn't like,

02:27.481 --> 02:28.721
"Whoa, this is unexpected.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.397
This is not what I was
expecting, Morty.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.066
What a perplexing mystery
this is."

02:32.152 --> 02:33.642
All right, all right,
we're inside the battery.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.398
I get it. You don't have
to bust my balls.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.446
Huh, this isn't right.
This pipe's supposed to be...

02:37.532 --> 02:40.490
sending 20 terawatts of
juice up to the engine, Morty.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.318
Instead we've got... zero?

02:42.412 --> 02:43.652
Now what
are these people doing?

02:43.747 --> 02:45.909
W-W-W-Whoa, people?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.615
It's time for some
hands-on engine repair.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.291
All right, Morty,
hold on to something.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.413
Whoa!

02:52.839 --> 02:54.204
Holy crap!

02:54.299 --> 02:56.210
I thought we were
inside your car battery, Rick.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.884
T-T-This is like a whole
p-planet or something.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.802
Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty
proud of this bad boy.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.345
Check it out.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.389
I put a spatially
tessellated void

03:04.476 --> 03:06.342
inside a modified
temporal field

03:06.436 --> 03:08.598
until a planet developed
intelligent life.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.272
I then introduced that life
to the wonders of electricity,

03:11.358 --> 03:13.599
which they now generate
on a global scale.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.435
And, you know, some of it goes
to power my engine

03:15.529 --> 03:17.111
and charge my phone
and stuff.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.279
You have a whole planet
making your power for you?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.448
- That's slavery.
- It's society.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.866
They work for each other,
Morty.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.535
They pay each other.
They buy houses.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.032
They get married and make
children that replace them

03:26.123 --> 03:27.830
when they get
too old to make power.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.032
That just sounds like slavery
with extra steps.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.040
Ooh la la, someone's
gonna get laid in college.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.041
It appears we are
being revisited

03:35.132 --> 03:37.874
by the alien known as Rick,
who once gave our world

03:37.968 --> 03:40.255
the gift
of gooble box technology,

03:40.345 --> 03:42.507
<i>which, when stomped on,
generates electricity,</i>

03:42.597 --> 03:44.679
<i>powering our homes
and businesses,</i>

03:44.766 --> 03:46.507
<i>improving our daily lives,
while safely removing</i>

03:46.601 --> 03:51.061
<i>the dangerous waste power
to a special disposal volcano.</i>

03:51.148 --> 03:52.684
But why has Rick returned?

03:52.774 --> 03:55.357
And what will he say
when he hears the big news?

03:55.444 --> 03:56.980
Let's find out.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.402
You need to tell these people
they're in a battery, Rick.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.730
It's messed up.
There's caterers down there.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.816
Th-Th-They're setting up
chafing dishes.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.196
Would you relax, Morty?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.994
There's nothing dishonest
about what we're doing.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.367
Now slap on these antennae.
They need to think we're aliens.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.450
- What? Why?
- Sh-- Obviously --

04:12.544 --> 04:15.002
You really know
nothing about car repair.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.923
Wait for the ramp,
Morty.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.752
They love
the slow ramp.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.429
Really gets their dicks hard
when they see this ramp

04:25.515 --> 04:27.756
just slowly
extending down.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.759
Greetings!

04:33.523 --> 04:35.184
Morty, you gotta
flip them off.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.186
I told them it means
"peace among worlds."

04:37.277 --> 04:38.608
How hilarious is that?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.154
Coming through.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.110
Two real aliens walking
through here.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.116
Rick,
our alien friend.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.118
Uh, Mr. President,
um, couldn't help but notice

04:52.209 --> 04:54.576
that you were having problems
generating power.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.036
That's correct.
We've evolved.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.339
Our most brilliant scientist,
Zeep Xanflorp,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.336
has developed
a source of energy

05:02.427 --> 05:05.089
that makes gooble boxes
obsolete.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.012
I would love to see it.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.465
- Fuck You.
- What did you say to me?!

05:09.559 --> 05:10.924
"Fuck You."

05:11.019 --> 05:13.807
Y-You told me
it means "much obliged."

05:13.897 --> 05:16.855
Oh. Right.
Uh, b-blow me.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.683
No, no, no.
Blow me.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.945
Zeep, you have an honored guest
from beyond the stars.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.572
I said 12 quantum stabilizers,
not 11.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.404
Fix it
or it's your ass.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.114
Chris, I'm in the middle
of something.

05:33.208 --> 05:36.326
Zeep, this is Rick --
The Alien.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.160
Rick The Alien.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.166
Rick
The Alien...

05:40.257 --> 05:41.839
Really?
You're gonna pull that move?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.632
I guided
your entire civilization.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.675
Your people have
a holiday named Ricksgiving.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.628
They teach kids
about me in school.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.180
I dropped out of school.
It's not for smart people.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.099
Ohhhh, snap!

05:52.185 --> 05:54.017
Listen to me,
you arrogant little --

05:54.104 --> 05:57.222
R-Rick was hoping
to see your new energy source.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.228
I think he could learn
a lot from you, Zeep.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.854
Fine.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.902
It's hard
for people to grasp,

06:03.989 --> 06:06.230
but inside that container is
an infinite universe

06:06.324 --> 06:08.235
with a planet capable
of generating

06:08.326 --> 06:10.408
massive amounts of power.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.736
I call it a miniverse.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.822
Dumb Name.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.202
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.375
I mean, it's hard
for us to comprehend all this.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.372
Would it be possible
for us to get some kind of tour

06:20.463 --> 06:22.249
of your miniverse
from the inside?

06:22.340 --> 06:23.876
This isn't a fucking
chocolate factory.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.423
I don't have time.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.877
Didn't you say time goes
more slowly in the miniverse

06:27.971 --> 06:29.882
relative to the real world?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.260
Yes, Chris.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.762
Great President.
All right, let's go.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.343
Whoa-Oh!

06:36.438 --> 06:38.520
Hold on to something.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.723
I put an unbounded vacuum
inside a temporal field

06:40.817 --> 06:42.353
until a world developed.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.310
I then introduced
the people of this world

06:44.404 --> 06:47.613
to the wonders of electricity
in the form of a device

06:47.699 --> 06:49.531
I call
a flooble crank.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.485
What they don't know is that 80%
of every crank's energy output

06:52.579 --> 06:54.411
gets channeled
out of the miniverse

06:54.497 --> 06:56.488
to be used by us.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.165
No more gooble boxes.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.992
I gotta tell you, Zeep,
with no disrespect,

07:00.086 --> 07:02.453
I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.912
- It's not cool.
- What?!

07:04.007 --> 07:06.920
Y-Y-You got the people
on this world slaving away

07:07.010 --> 07:08.626
making your power.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.210
I mean, that's
what I call slavery.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.046
No, no, no,
they work for each other

07:12.140 --> 07:14.256
in exchange for money,
which they then --

07:14.351 --> 07:17.560
Well, that just sounds like
slavery with extra steps.

07:17.646 --> 07:21.389
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's
gonna get laid in college.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.689
Rick, a word?

07:22.776 --> 07:23.811
What the hell was that?

07:23.902 --> 07:25.643
I know.
"eek barba dirkle"?

07:25.737 --> 07:27.193
That's a pretty
fucked up "ooh la la."

07:27.280 --> 07:28.896
No, what are you doing
telling this guy

07:28.990 --> 07:30.776
that his miniverse is
unethical?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.904
D-Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

07:32.994 --> 07:36.077
Holy crap.
You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy!

07:36.164 --> 07:37.950
Somewhere on this planet,
there's gotta be an arrogant...

07:38.041 --> 07:40.499
scientist prick on the verge
of microverse technology,

07:40.585 --> 07:42.701
which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.958
forcing Zeep
to say microverses are bad,

07:45.048 --> 07:47.836
at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.338
His people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

07:50.428 --> 07:52.965
and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

07:53.056 --> 07:54.967
Eating that motherfucking
ice cream!

07:55.058 --> 07:56.890
Slurping, slurping,
slurping it up.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.184
Wh-Wh-Why are you making
that face?

07:59.270 --> 08:00.681
Holy shit!

08:00.772 --> 08:02.854
It's me. I've convinced
the people of this planet

08:02.941 --> 08:04.807
that I'm a traveler
from another world.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.858
You don't think that's over-
... doing it a little?

08:06.945 --> 08:09.061
I mean, you can achieve the same
effect with a pair of --

08:09.155 --> 08:11.237
Never mind. You know what?
I shouldn't be so critical.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.564
I'm an alien.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.775
Places, please.
We're about to land.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.535
Too fast.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.624
<i>Law enforcement
converging on location.</i>

08:26.715 --> 08:27.876
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

08:27.966 --> 08:30.628
No! No, no!
Don't hurt anybody!

08:30.719 --> 08:33.256
<i>Confirm

08:33.346 --> 08:36.054

- Yes.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.765
<i>Scanning assailants.</i>

08:45.775 --> 08:48.142
<i>Psychological option

08:50.280 --> 08:51.486
"Gestating"?

08:51.573 --> 08:53.155
Come out
with your hands up,

08:53.241 --> 08:56.324
or we will be forced
to open fire!

08:56.411 --> 08:57.901
- Incoming!
- We got a device!

08:57.996 --> 08:59.703
Bomb! Bomb!

09:02.167 --> 09:03.282
Daddy?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.287
Oh, my god.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.868
- H-Hunter?
- Daddy?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.545
What the hell?

09:08.631 --> 09:11.043
Jesus Christ, cease fire!
Stay back!

09:11.134 --> 09:12.169
H-H-Hunter?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.046
- Daddy.
- Hunter!

09:14.137 --> 09:16.048
Oh, my dear,
sweet god, Hunter.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.379
Oh, my boy.
My boy.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.841
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.050
I'm sorry.
Daddy, leave the car alone.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.180
W-W-W-What?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.308
Leave the car alone.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.888
Hunter?
Don't --

09:26.983 --> 09:28.144
Oh, my god.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.396
Stay here, Hunter!
No!

09:30.487 --> 09:33.354
God, no!
Hunter!

09:33.448 --> 09:35.530
<i>All of you have loved ones.</i>

09:35.617 --> 09:37.199
<i>All can be returned.</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:39.822
<i>All can be taken away.</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:41.870
<i>Please step away
from the vehicle.</i>

09:43.166 --> 09:45.407
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

09:45.502 --> 09:48.210
And if you continue
to turn your flooble cranks,

09:48.296 --> 09:50.788
I will bring you
other great alien advancements.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.214
- Hey, lemme ask you something.
- Yes?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.884
Any of your, uh, scientists
working on anything new?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.335
All of them.
That's their job.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.888
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I mean, like, energy-wise.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.261
Anyone working on, say,
a little universe in a box?

10:02.352 --> 10:04.389
How do you know about that?
It's top secret.

10:04.479 --> 10:08.347
So remember -- A crank
a day is not nearly enough.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.102
Crank it.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.901
I told them this means
"peace among worlds."

10:12.987 --> 10:14.318
How hilarious is that?

10:14.405 --> 10:15.987
Re-Really funny, Zeep.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.065
Hey, Zeep, the fake president
of your fake world

10:18.159 --> 10:20.526
has something fake important
to show you.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.829
It's not much now,

10:23.915 --> 10:25.872
but once I learn to accelerate
the temporal field,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.417
I'll be able to interact with
any sentient life that evolves

10:28.503 --> 10:31.165
and introduce them
to the wonders of electricity

10:31.256 --> 10:34.248
via a pulley-based device
I call a blooble yank.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.458
But what
they won't know is --

10:36.553 --> 10:38.419
You'll be taking
most of their energy.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.878
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.431
It's show- ... time.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.142
You do realize this will make
the flooble crank obsolete?

10:49.232 --> 10:52.975
This is wrong, Kyle.
What you're doing is wrong.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.356
You're basically --
This is slavery.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.858
You're talking about creating
a planet of slaves.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.405
Told you, Zeep.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.278
Oh, they won't be slaves.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.406
They'll work for each other
and pay each other money.

11:03.496 --> 11:08.536
That just sounds like slavery
with ex... tra... steps.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.333
- What?
- Wait a minute.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.037
Did you create my universe?
Is my universe a miniverse?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.247
- Microverse!
- Uh, teenyverse.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.207
- Ugh!
- You bastard!

11:17.302 --> 11:19.168
Much obliged.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.004
- What the hell is happening?
- This is healthy. Trust me.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.884
You're my battery,
motherfucker!

11:23.975 --> 11:25.181
That's all you are.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.179
I made you.
Your microverse sucks!

11:27.270 --> 11:29.307
And your miniverse is the size
of a fucking lobster tank!

11:29.397 --> 11:30.432
It's wack!

11:30.523 --> 11:32.480
Are they
not really aliens?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.854
Nah, they're just
a couple of crazy,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.901
wacky scientists,
you know?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.444
So he made
a universe,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.192
and that guy is
from that universe.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.490
- You're my battery!
- And that guy made a universe.

11:42.577 --> 11:46.070
And that's the universe
where I was born.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.326
Where my father died.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.578
Where I couldn't make time
for his funeral

11:50.668 --> 11:55.037
because I was working
on my universe.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.872
- I made you!
- Yeah.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.582
Science, huh?
Ain't it a thing.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.917
You know, one time,
Rick sh-- accidentally shot

12:01.012 --> 12:02.594
his laser pistol
right through my hand.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.218
You know, I mean, like,
Old-Lady Science, you know?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.050
She's a real --

12:08.144 --> 12:09.384
You got to hang on tight,
you know?

12:09.479 --> 12:12.221
Because she -- she --
She bucks pretty hard.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.307
Ooh, boy, what --
Oh, my god, no!

12:20.114 --> 12:21.320
- Teenyverse.
- Teenyverse.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.442
Come on, come on,
come on.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.652
Pterodactyl!

12:27.747 --> 12:29.078
Asshole!

12:29.165 --> 12:30.655
When I get
out of this teenyverse,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.491
I'm gonna smash it to pieces
with you in it.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.201
Yeah, well, when I get
out of this teenyverse,

12:34.295 --> 12:35.877
I'm gonna get out of
the surrounding miniverse

12:35.964 --> 12:37.705
and then the microverse
around that, and guess what?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.710
Don't make things worse,
Rick!

12:39.801 --> 12:41.712
Uh, he's not gonna destroy
your universe.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.760
You know, we -- we need it
to start our car.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.803
That's what you used
my universe for --

12:45.890 --> 12:47.676
to run your car?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.349
Yeah, but don't
flatter yourself.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.848
There's always AAA,
you fucking cock sucker!

12:52.939 --> 12:54.521
What's he doing?
What's he crafting?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.223
I can craft stuff,
too, pal!

12:56.317 --> 12:58.149
Just like I crafted
your reality!

12:59.153 --> 13:01.269
You crafty son of a --

13:01.364 --> 13:03.526
Ow! I crafted the guy
that created

13:03.616 --> 13:05.402
the planet
you're standing on!

13:05.493 --> 13:06.824
Yeah, and I made the stars
that became

13:06.911 --> 13:08.197
the carbon
in your mother's ovaries!

13:08.288 --> 13:09.904
I didn't ask to be born!

13:09.998 --> 13:11.534
All right, that's it!
I'm out.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.285
I-I'm gonna go
into the wilderness,

13:13.376 --> 13:14.741
and I'm gonna make
a new life for myself

13:14.836 --> 13:16.292
among the tree people.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.915
I-It can't be worse
than this.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.542
Sure. Okay, Morty,
just be back before sundown

13:19.632 --> 13:20.918
or the tree people
will eat you.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.124
That's a myth!

13:22.218 --> 13:24.084
W-W-Why are you trying
to start a myth?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.714
It's a prehistoric planet,
Morty.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.421
Someone has to bring
a little culture.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.176
And i-i-it certainly
can't be someone

13:29.267 --> 13:32.100
whose entire culture powers
my brake lights!

13:34.689 --> 13:37.147
Go, go, go!

13:37.233 --> 13:39.565
Oh, my god.
Oh, god.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.563
What are we gonna do now?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.986
<i>I am unable
to destroy this army.</i>

13:44.073 --> 13:46.986
<i>To clarify, I am quite able to
destroy this army,</i>

13:47.076 --> 13:49.613
- <i>but you will not permit it.</i>
- Correct.

13:49.704 --> 13:53.572
<i>You also refuse to authorize
emotional countermeasures.</i>

13:53.666 --> 13:56.033
If you're talking
about the melting ghost babies,

13:56.127 --> 13:57.868
yes, please,
no more of that.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.327
<i>Confirmed.</i>

14:01.090 --> 14:03.047
<i>I am currently constructing
a security measure</i>

14:03.134 --> 14:04.966
<i>in compliance
with your parameters.</i>

14:05.053 --> 14:08.136
<i>But I do want to say
you are not making this easy.</i>

14:08.222 --> 14:09.883
You know you're
kind of a dick, right?

14:09.974 --> 14:12.887
<i>My function is
to keep Summer safe,</i>

14:12.977 --> 14:16.060
<i>not keep Summer being,
like, totally stoked</i>

14:16.147 --> 14:19.014
<i>about, like,
the general vibe and stuff.</i>

14:19.108 --> 14:21.725
<i>That's you.
That's how you talk.</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:27.982
Hey, that's my deer!

14:29.369 --> 14:30.825
Aaaaaaah!

14:30.912 --> 14:32.152
Raah!

14:32.246 --> 14:35.284
I hope your god is
as big a dick as you.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.543
My god's the biggest dick
that's never existed.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.746
Why do you think
I'm even here?

14:44.092 --> 14:46.675
You're here...

14:46.761 --> 14:49.128
because you created
someone smarter than you.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.926
Oh, I thought
we were both here

14:53.017 --> 14:55.133
because I created
a universe of idiots.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.147
Kalo kada sha Ia.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.695
Holy shit. Morty?
I haven't seen you in months!

15:06.781 --> 15:08.522
You're leading
the tree people?

15:08.616 --> 15:09.947
Huh.
That's a step up.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.240
We have no leaders.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.819
We follow
only the will of the forest.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.028
Ooh. Wow.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.454
Gaaaaay.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.031
That is pretty gay.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.958
You two call yourselves
geniuses,

15:20.044 --> 15:22.661
but you have spent
this time learning nothing.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.496
Come with me
into the forest.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.127
There is something
I wish to teach you.

15:30.513 --> 15:34.097
This is Ku'ala,
the spirit tree.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.094
For generations,
it has guided the --

15:37.353 --> 15:39.390
You have to get us
the fuck outta here.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.266
These people are
backwards savages.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.939
They eat
every third baby

15:43.025 --> 15:45.062
because they think
it makes fruit grow bigger.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.565
Everyone's gross, and they all
smell like piss all the time.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.238
I m-- I m-- I miss my family.
I miss my laptop.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.065
I masturbated
to an extra-curvy piece

15:52.160 --> 15:53.571
of driftwood the other day!

15:53.661 --> 15:55.277
Look, I-I don't care
what it takes.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.987
You two are putting aside
your bullshit,

15:57.081 --> 15:59.368
and you're working together
to get us back home.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.291
No can do, Morty.
I just can't.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.993
I just don't see
how I can --

16:03.087 --> 16:04.293
Ro ro dah no gah!

16:04.380 --> 16:07.088
You're smart.
You'll figure it out.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.337
You have 10 seconds

16:09.427 --> 16:11.259
to get out of the ship!

16:11.345 --> 16:14.053
10, 9...

16:14.140 --> 16:15.380
All right, not bad.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.466
I guess you're
an okay proto recombinator.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.143
I've certainly seen
worse ionic cell dioxination.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.936
If this works,
drinks are on me.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.639
If drinks are on you,
you're gonna need

16:23.733 --> 16:25.349
a second mortgage
on that tower.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.933
I'm an alcoholic.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.439
Opium addict.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.273
All right, okay, okay,
okay, wrap it up.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.949
You guys are
the fucking worst!

16:35.036 --> 16:36.242
Your gods are a lie!

16:36.329 --> 16:38.787
Fuck you, fuck nature,
and fuck trees!

16:41.334 --> 16:42.495
Yes! You did it!
Yes!

16:42.585 --> 16:44.292
Hey, uh,
how about that drink?

16:44.378 --> 16:47.120
Sure, I just need to go grab
my wallet from inside my ship.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.705
Oh, is your wallet
in your ship?

16:48.799 --> 16:50.289
That's where
the transporter is, too,

16:50.384 --> 16:51.795
so why don't we
come with?

16:51.886 --> 16:55.129
It's cool.
I'll be back in a sec.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.966
You know how long a second can
take in a microverse?

16:59.060 --> 17:01.142
Run, Morty! That asshole's
willing to risk...

17:01.229 --> 17:02.765
everything he cares
about just to defeat me!

17:02.855 --> 17:04.220
He's psychotic!

17:06.901 --> 17:08.811
- Morty, hop on my back.
- Why?

17:08.903 --> 17:11.315
Go, go
Sanchez ski shoes.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.490
- Aaaaaah!
- ...eight...

17:16.786 --> 17:18.071
Aaaah!
Oof!

17:19.454 --> 17:21.946
Hold still.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.781
Oh, hey, guys.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.367
I just finished
cooking us a feast.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.169
- Aaaah!
- Holy --

17:28.256 --> 17:30.463
- You monster!
- Whoa. Bad tour.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.086
...seven...

17:32.176 --> 17:33.666
Hey, you gotta sign out.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.093
Nothing you do matters!
Your existence is a lie!

17:36.180 --> 17:39.718
If that were
really true, then...

17:39.809 --> 17:41.971
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.
- Third floor.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.677
Would you like
to go to dinner with --

17:43.771 --> 17:45.353
Uh, no.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.899
You may have created
this universe, Rick,

17:49.986 --> 17:52.569
- but I live in it.
- Shit!

17:52.655 --> 17:54.396
What are we gonna do, Rick?
We're so screwed.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.197
He's gonna get to the ship
and smash the microverse,

17:56.284 --> 17:57.740
and then he's gonna kill us!

17:57.827 --> 17:59.409
Quick, Morty, you've got
to turn into a car.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.111
- What?!
- A long time ago...

18:01.205 --> 18:02.821
I implanted you with
a subdermal chip that could

18:02.915 --> 18:04.701
call upon dormant nanobots
in your bloodstream

18:04.792 --> 18:07.033
to restructure your anatomy
and turn you into a car.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.539
- Oh, my God!
- Concentrate, Morty.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.915
Concentrate and turn
into a car, Morty.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.122
Never mind. Here's a taxi.
Get in. It's fine.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.924
...six...

18:17.430 --> 18:18.716
- Hey, Zeep.
- Huh?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.423
Happy Ricksgiving,
biiiiiitch.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.383
Aaah!

18:23.477 --> 18:24.842
We did it, Morty.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.848
Now let's get out of here
and destroy this whole universe.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.270
Excuse me?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.348
- ...five --
- Sir?

18:32.987 --> 18:34.694
- Holy hell.
- Sir!

18:35.906 --> 18:37.021
Hold your fire!

18:39.827 --> 18:41.283
What's going on?

18:41.370 --> 18:42.701
<i>I have brokered
a peace agreement</i>

18:42.788 --> 18:45.155
<i>between the giant spiders
and the government.</i>

18:45.249 --> 18:48.583
Thanks to the skilled diplomacy
of this mysterious space car,

18:48.669 --> 18:51.502
from this day forward,
human and spiderkind will live

18:51.589 --> 18:53.455
side by side in peace.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.210
We will stop bombing them,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.212
and they will no longer use
their telepathic abilities

18:57.303 --> 18:59.715
to make us wander into webs
for later consumption.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.341
Instead, we will
work together

19:01.432 --> 19:03.799
to make this world
a better place for all,

19:03.893 --> 19:06.134
no matter how many legs.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.344
What do we do
about the space car?

19:08.439 --> 19:09.679
Leave it alone.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.356
I mean, what did it
really do, anyways?

19:11.442 --> 19:12.682
Kill a guy
and paralyze his buddy?

19:12.777 --> 19:15.565
Not a bad trade
for spider peace.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.521
All right, that's it.
Move out!

19:22.495 --> 19:25.328
I love this spider!

19:25.414 --> 19:27.030
<i>Summer is safe.</i>

19:27.124 --> 19:28.614
All right, I get it.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.832
Riiiick!

19:35.591 --> 19:37.173
Don't do it.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.502
You quit school, but you
still got some learning to do.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.266
Aah!

19:54.360 --> 19:55.771
Unh!

20:04.578 --> 20:06.535
Class dismissed.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.909
Geez.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.086
- You all right?
- Uh-Huh!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.382
What are you doing,
Rick?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.085
I'm pretty sure
the battery's dead.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.465
Oh, you think so,
huh, Morty?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.138
Well, let's see.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.556
Hey, wait -- Huh?
I don't get it.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.850
Of course you don't.
But Zeep did.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.427
He knew that once I got
back to my car,

20:31.522 --> 20:33.354
one of two things
was gonna happen --

20:33.441 --> 20:35.432
I was gonna have to toss
a broken battery,

20:35.526 --> 20:38.359
or the battery wouldn't
be broken.

20:42.825 --> 20:46.614
Peace among worlds, Rick.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.819
Jesus.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.495
Yeah.
Listen to that baby purr.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.164
You were right, Morty --

20:51.250 --> 20:52.740
We really just needed to
be honest with those guys.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.041
All right, here we go.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.379
Thank y-o-o-ou...

20:58.466 --> 21:00.207
See, Morty?
This is what it's all about.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.883
This is why we do
what we do.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.459
- Uh-Huh.
- Ew! What the hell?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.591
Jesus!
There's flies in my ice cream.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.887
Presidential decree --

21:06.974 --> 21:09.341
All ice cream is now
for all beings,

21:09.435 --> 21:10.925
no matter how many legs.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.602
What the fuck
did you do, Summer?!

21:12.688 --> 21:14.304
It was your ship!
Your stupid ship did it!

21:14.398 --> 21:16.014
- Don't blame my ship!
- It melted a child!

21:16.108 --> 21:18.019
My ship doesn't do anything
unless it's told to!

21:18.110 --> 21:19.771
I don't want
to hear it, Summer!

21:19.862 --> 21:21.853
Your boobs are
all hanging about,

21:21.947 --> 21:23.779
and you ruined ice cream
with your boobs out.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.527
And don't even try
to deny it, either.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.664
Oh, my god!

22:15.751 --> 22:17.116
Did you get any of that?

22:17.211 --> 22:19.168
It's a good show!
