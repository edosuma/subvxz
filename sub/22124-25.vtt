Hey.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.628
How's it going, Frank?

00:19.671 --> 00:21.717
You still kicking
that hernia's butt?

00:21.760 --> 00:22.674
Nice.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.111
Morning, Jane.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.156
Talk about a buzzer-beater
last night, am I right?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.244
Bam!

00:27.288 --> 00:28.332
Hey, guys.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.551
Morning.

00:30.726 --> 00:34.034
Oh, I like your hair today.Thank you.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.085
Tough break, Beth.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.697
But we're gonna figure out
what happened to you.

[phone ringing, vibrating]

00:51.181 --> 00:53.531
Hey, little brother.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.664
You did what?

00:55.707 --> 00:57.840
They said that?

00:57.883 --> 01:00.234
Well, that's never gonna happen.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.410
Seriously?

01:02.453 --> 01:04.281
Fine, okay.

01:04.325 --> 01:07.067
[camera clicking]

01:07.110 --> 01:08.155
[laughs]
Dude.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.417
What are you doing?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.158
Well, this macro lens
gets so much more detail

01:11.201 --> 01:12.637
than my phone
camera does.Gross.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.726
Oh, someone's
a crabby-pants today.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.119
How's it going, Ella?

01:16.163 --> 01:17.207
Couldn't be better.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.730
Really?

01:19.992 --> 01:21.864
Sorry, my brother just called.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.909
Ah, right.
Well, family are the worst.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.389
Crab away.Well, apparently,

01:25.433 --> 01:29.132
uh, my brother moved back
to Detroit a week ago.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.308
And did he bother to
give me a heads-up?

01:31.352 --> 01:32.396
Uh, no, señor.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.745
Not to mention
that he's the reason

01:33.789 --> 01:35.356
I moved out to L.A.
in the first place.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.794
And now my whole family wants me
to move back home, too.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.886
Are you considering
moving back home?

01:43.929 --> 01:47.107
Well, I mean, you guys know
how much I love it here, but...

01:47.150 --> 01:48.630
they're my family.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.458
So, you know, yeah.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.982
Well, Ella, you know, I'm... I'm
trying to be supportive, but...

01:53.025 --> 01:55.332
Well, I'm not.
Don't you dare go.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.334
I may not have a choice.

01:57.378 --> 01:58.857
Everyone has a choice, Ms. Lo...

01:58.901 --> 02:01.817
Anyhoo, um,
so much going on here.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.340
Let me show you.Mm-hmm.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.951
This right here is Dr. Beth
Daly, child psychiatrist.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.127
CHLOE:
Looks like blunt force trauma.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.911
Someone hit her over the head?

02:08.954 --> 02:12.654
Yes, and yes, but there's
so much more to it than that.

02:12.697 --> 02:16.048
From what I can tell,
the killer was standing here

02:16.092 --> 02:17.876
when they grabbed
their murder weapon.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.052
You see this spot in the dust,
right here?

02:20.096 --> 02:22.185
Fallen books,
and only one bookend.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.665
So she was killed with
the missing bookend?

02:23.708 --> 02:26.146
Mm, yes and no.
So the bookend...

02:26.189 --> 02:27.756
[imitates impact]
made her woozy, right?

02:27.799 --> 02:32.543
And then, she stumbled,
slipped on this toy train,

02:32.587 --> 02:35.677
grabbed this chair, fell back,

02:35.720 --> 02:39.855
hit her head on this table and
bang, that's what killed her.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.422
Oh, bravo, Ms. Lopez.
See, that's another reason

02:41.465 --> 02:42.684
why you shouldn't leave.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.207
Crime scenes would be
so dull without you.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.427
Thank you.
But wait, there's more.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.342
There always is.I found

02:48.385 --> 02:51.519
a weird clump of hair
under Beth's nails.

02:51.562 --> 02:54.130
It's all gunky, too.Is that blood?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.524
Mm, I can't really tell yet,
there's not enough of it.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.221
I got to get it
back to the lab.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.354
CHLOE:
Hmm. Oh.

03:00.397 --> 03:03.705
Well, looks like there's a smear
here, like somebody tried

03:03.748 --> 03:05.533
to wipe away some blood.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.056
ELLA:
Good eye.

03:07.099 --> 03:08.623
I'm thinking maybe the
girl who called it in?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.842
Yeah.
Beckett Wilson.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.366
She was the doctor's
next patient.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.238
She found the body,
she was pretty shaken up.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.935
Talk about shock therapy.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.242
Well, I mean, wiping
blood off the wound

03:19.286 --> 03:21.549
is consistent with someone
who cares about the victim.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.029
Well, Dan took Beckett to
the precinct to calm her down,

03:24.073 --> 03:25.248
so I'll go check in with them.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.815
Okay, and I'll check
in with the lab,

03:26.858 --> 03:28.382
see if they can
rush this hair.
Great.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.687
All right.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.950
I will check in
with the nearest pharmacy.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.431
DAN: No, she still
isn't talking.

03:34.475 --> 03:37.042
Poor kid's pretty traumatized.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.830
No, I don't see any blood
on her hands or her clothes.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.614
I'll ask her.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.094
Bye.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.748
[beeps]

03:46.791 --> 03:48.271
[clears throat]

03:48.315 --> 03:51.361
Hey, Beckett?

03:51.405 --> 03:54.059
When you found the body,

03:54.103 --> 03:57.454
did you maybe try to
wipe up any blood?

03:57.498 --> 04:01.023
I don't think I did.

04:01.066 --> 04:04.461
But it's all so fuzzy.

04:04.505 --> 04:07.116
Hey, it's okay.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.639
[sniffles]

04:08.683 --> 04:09.988
We'll just talk later.

04:12.121 --> 04:15.298
Is there anything
I can do now?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.082
[sniffles]

04:17.126 --> 04:19.302
A Slurpee would be nice.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.697
A Slurpee it is.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.873
See you, Frank.You, too.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.318
What's this?

04:50.855 --> 04:54.163
ANTHONY:
You don't possibly think
my son could've done this.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.818
No, Mr. Rodriguez,
Felix is not a suspect.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.646
He doesn't fit the
forensic's profile.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.170
However, we did look
at Beth's appointment book,

05:01.213 --> 05:03.520
and he was scheduled
for much earlier this morning.

05:03.564 --> 05:06.001
So do you have any idea
why he was still here?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.481
Of course I do.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.526
He brought his violin
to his appointment this morning,

05:09.570 --> 05:10.832
and he left it there.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.355
The office isn't far
from our house,

05:12.399 --> 05:14.531
so I let him ride his bike
back to get it.

05:14.575 --> 05:18.143
Well, we think Felix got here
shortly after Beth was killed.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.537
So we'd like to speak to him,
see if he saw anything.

05:20.581 --> 05:23.366
Well, that might be tough.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.891
Uh, Felix is... shy.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.416
He struggles
with communication,

05:29.459 --> 05:30.852
social skills.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.636
That's why he was
seeing Dr. Beth.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.985
Mm.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.291
I don't know
what we're gonna do without her.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.598
I mean, she's helped
Felix so much.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.339
He's thriving
in school,

05:39.382 --> 05:44.213
he's got all kinds of new
friends and-and interests.

05:44.256 --> 05:47.434
He's like a totally
different kid.

05:47.477 --> 05:50.393
He's just still not
very open with strangers.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.482
I see.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.094
Hey, buddy.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.053
Can I help you get that off?

06:02.971 --> 06:06.801
You know, when I
was about your age,

06:06.844 --> 06:08.977
I was in a car accident.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.283
It was pretty bad.

06:11.327 --> 06:16.419
I saw lots and
lots of blood.

06:16.463 --> 06:20.118
I know how scary
it can be.

06:20.162 --> 06:24.340
But you're gonna be okay.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.256
I promise.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.781
[whispers]:
I didn't see who did it.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.567
Okay. Thanks for telling me.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.788
Oh, my gosh, mijito,
are you okay?

06:37.832 --> 06:40.487
What happened?Hey, let's just get
Felix home right now.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.141
I'll explain everything
when we've all calmed down.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.622
Here's my card.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.582
If Felix thinks of anything
else, or mentions anything,

06:48.625 --> 06:50.105
please, feel free to call me.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.411
All right.
Thank you.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.986
Well, aren't you
a little strange one?

07:02.030 --> 07:04.336
WOMAN [whispering]:
I know you are, but what am I?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.731
Ray-Ray?

07:07.775 --> 07:09.820
What are you doing here?

07:09.864 --> 07:12.519
Now, is that any way to greet
one of your oldest friends?

07:12.562 --> 07:14.477
Okay, hi.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.348
We kind of sort of
agreed to never

07:16.392 --> 07:18.089
see each other again.Did we?

07:18.133 --> 07:20.222
I don't remember putting
such a fine point on it.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.353
We did, we did. Super fine.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.746
Five years ago, in Detroit?

07:22.790 --> 07:23.747
I know you remember.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.532
Look, I'm sorry.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.403
I just... I miss you.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.667
Okay, it's not that I don't
miss you, too, okay?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.974
I just thought that
this part of my life was over.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.497
The part with you in it.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.107
It's just...
it's a little too weird.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.545
Okay? So please,
just go away. Just...

07:38.588 --> 07:41.678
Hey, sorry, uh,
should I come back another time?

07:41.722 --> 07:43.854
No.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.465
Good.

07:45.508 --> 07:46.770
I'm all good.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.555
Are you sure?

07:48.598 --> 07:52.515
Yeah. Yeah, I'm-I'm fantastic,
actually, just, you know,

07:52.559 --> 07:54.561
talking to myself.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.649
Mm-hmm.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.566
♪

08:05.528 --> 08:08.270
You sure you're fine?Fantastic, actually,

08:08.313 --> 08:09.750
you know,
just talking to myself.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.361
Uh, uh, to this evidence.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.711
Wish it would just
go away. [chuckles]

08:14.755 --> 08:16.147
Wish it would go away, why?

08:16.191 --> 08:18.062
Because it just showed
up out of nowhere.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.369
Just... poof.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.371
What?Yeah, so, you
remember that,

08:22.414 --> 08:26.288
um, weird clump of hair
that I found on the vic?

08:26.331 --> 08:27.724
Well, it turns out

08:27.768 --> 08:30.597
that it's a synthetic fur,
used to make anything

08:30.640 --> 08:33.513
from carpets to,
uh, plush toys.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.384
Okay, but it was found
under Beth's nails, right?

08:35.427 --> 08:36.690
Which still implies a struggle.

08:36.733 --> 08:37.908
And there was blood on it?

08:37.952 --> 08:40.737
Nope. Turns out
that it was ketchup.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.870
Even though there wasn't a
scrap of food in the joint.

08:42.913 --> 08:46.090
So, uh, like I said, it
just came out of nowhere.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.179
Do you see why
it's so annoying?

08:48.223 --> 08:49.485
Okay, I'm gonna go
search Beth's house.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.226
Maybe I'll find a match
to the fur there.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.575
Great. Uh,
I'll join you.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.099
You're trying to
avoid me, aren't you?

08:55.143 --> 08:57.101
Nope. No, I am not.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.887
La, la, la, la...Come on, Ellz, let's just
hang for a little bit.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.193
[quietly]:
No. You're a ghost.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.979
[sighs]

09:05.022 --> 09:06.241
Not to be biased,

09:06.284 --> 09:08.330
but ghosts
are pretty frickin' cool,

09:08.373 --> 09:09.679
and you being able to see them

09:09.723 --> 09:12.334
makes you extra
frickin' special.

09:12.377 --> 09:15.816
Okay, first of all,
I see aghost-- aghost-- you.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.514
And yes, as a kid,
I did feel special, okay?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.603
But special or not,
it's not normal.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.823
And since when
do you care about that?

09:22.866 --> 09:24.085
Normal is boring.

09:24.128 --> 09:25.347
Since Detroit.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.870
We agreed, both of us,

09:26.914 --> 09:29.525
that this wasn't good
for me anymore, okay?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.528
I really like who I am in L.A.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.966
I'm just this super happy
open book.

09:36.010 --> 09:39.187
It feels really, really good
to have no secrets.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.493
Okay, then,
tell everyone about me.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.279
Don't hide your Ray-Ray of light
under a bushel, baby.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.541
Yeah, I tried that, remember?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.325
Remember Laurie Dupont's
slumber party,

09:47.369 --> 09:49.066
when they wrote "weirdo" on me

09:49.110 --> 09:50.546
in shaving cream?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.200

10:53.957 --> 10:56.133

the young lady to the precinct

10:56.177 --> 10:58.353

with your phone.

I care. I care a lot.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.156
And I don't know why
you're here, Ray-Ray.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.463
All right? I-I think it's time
that you leave.

20:03.506 --> 20:07.293
I'm not lying. I-I am here for
personal, unfinished business.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.339
It's just not about the case.
It's about you.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.688
Really?

20:11.732 --> 20:14.125
I know I agreed to stay away,

20:14.169 --> 20:18.695
but, you know, sometimes I, uh,
sort of check up on you.

20:18.739 --> 20:19.783
So much for boundaries.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.045
And I heard you talking

20:21.089 --> 20:22.569
to your brother on the phone.

20:22.612 --> 20:26.442
I know you're thinking
about moving back to Detroit.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.314
I knew it. You're here
to convince me

20:28.357 --> 20:29.793
to move back home, aren't you?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.447
No, actually, the exact opposite

20:31.491 --> 20:34.798
because moving back to Detroit
is a terrible idea.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.365
Okay.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.673
That explains all the talk about
how great L.A. is, but why?

20:39.716 --> 20:42.676
Because your freaking
leech brothers live there.

20:42.719 --> 20:47.158
Hey. No one insults
my family, except for me.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.813
And they need me.They don't need you.
They use you.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.468
And the people out here,
they see how kind you are,

20:52.512 --> 20:54.514
but they don't take
advantage of you.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.125
The people out here don't know
everything about me, okay?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.823
They don't know about you,
but my family does.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.390
They know
and they still love me.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.131
You know, the way
I look at it

21:03.174 --> 21:05.438
is you've always looked out
for everybody,

21:05.481 --> 21:08.615
but I think you deserve someone
looking out for you for once.

21:13.228 --> 21:17.319
Well, that is a very
sweet thing to say.

21:17.363 --> 21:21.149
And I guess I'm 10% less
irritated that you lied.

21:22.324 --> 21:26.154
So is that the real reason
you're here?

21:26.197 --> 21:28.504
To tell me not
to move back home?

21:30.811 --> 21:32.160
[doorknob rattling]

21:32.203 --> 21:34.075
Okay, that was not me.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.990
Uh...

21:42.866 --> 21:45.216
[whispering]: Why are you
hiding? Nobody can see you.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.050
[broomstick rattles]

21:53.094 --> 21:54.704
[whispering]:
Nice one.

22:05.585 --> 22:06.542
[groans]

22:06.586 --> 22:08.631
Okay.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.201
[grunting]

22:14.724 --> 22:16.291
Now kick him in the nards!

22:19.860 --> 22:21.731
You let him get away.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.691
Nope.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.736
I got him right here.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.131
Lovely, I love the, uh...
it really accentuates your...

22:30.174 --> 22:31.350
Oh, my.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.614
Daniel. Did you have fun?

22:34.657 --> 22:37.094
Chili dog or not,
I hate roller coasters,

22:37.138 --> 22:38.269
so thank you.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.228
Oh, no. No, no, no.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.883
Thank you. [laughs][Dan groans]

22:42.926 --> 22:44.754
Yes, Gemma here gave
me a great deal.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.756
200 for the price of 200.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.759
So there's enough for
everyone at the precinct.

22:49.803 --> 22:53.328
Where's...
where's Beckett?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.504
Oh, that little girl
is so helpful.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.463
She's the one who introduced
me to Gemma, actually.
Hmm.

22:57.506 --> 23:00.596
Yeah, she just ran off to get
us a couple of churro...

23:00.640 --> 23:02.511
Oh.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.643
[Dan laughing]

23:05.688 --> 23:06.863
In your face.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.778
She read you like a book.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.433
All day long you're making fun
of me for getting duped by a kid

23:11.477 --> 23:12.782
and you lost her, too.[chuckles]

23:12.826 --> 23:15.785
You lost her.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.221
Oh, that's bad.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.832
This is really bad.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.530
Daniel, you don't happen to have
my car keys on you, do you?

23:23.184 --> 23:24.228
What?

23:24.272 --> 23:27.231
She took my badge.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.885
Oh. Well...

23:28.929 --> 23:31.410
good news is at least
I got your phone back.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.764
BOTH:
That little bitch.

23:39.983 --> 23:42.638
Fingerprints on the broom
are too smudged to I.D.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.858
All I got were traces
of chalk and rosin.

23:44.901 --> 23:48.514
Rosin?
Yeah, a substance
with, like, a gajillion uses:

23:48.557 --> 23:52.082
adhesives, soap, chewing gum,
hard to narrow down.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.519
I think I got something.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.608
This is surveillance footage

23:55.651 --> 23:57.348
from the traffic light
near Beth's office.

23:57.392 --> 24:00.482
This car sped away
after your tussle with that man

24:00.526 --> 24:03.224
and was there during the fight
that Iris told us about.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.486
Sweet.
Sweet.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.140
Who is it?

24:06.183 --> 24:08.882
Well, the license plate
and the driver aren't visible,

24:08.925 --> 24:10.057
but we do have this.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.363
It's a bumper sticker

24:12.407 --> 24:13.539
from Rancho Middle School

24:13.582 --> 24:14.888
where Felix and
Beckett attend.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.020
Chalk on the broom.
I-It could be a teacher.

24:17.064 --> 24:19.414
I know.
Hmm?

24:19.458 --> 24:23.462
We know that there was chalk
on the broom, right?

24:23.505 --> 24:25.507
Could be a teacher.

24:25.551 --> 24:26.943
Mm, maybe, but which one?

24:26.987 --> 24:30.251
Well, you know what else
rosin is used for?

24:30.294 --> 24:31.774
A violin bow.

24:31.818 --> 24:34.864
Didn't Felix leave his violin
in Beth's office?

24:34.908 --> 24:36.300
Look up the music teacher.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.389
CHLOE:
There he is, Jonathan Burke.

24:39.521 --> 24:43.394
You're good.
[laughs]

24:43.438 --> 24:46.528
Okay. Yes, I-I was
in Beth's office,

24:46.572 --> 24:48.269
but I'm really sorry
I scared you.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.575
What were you trying to do?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.577
Destroy evidence that
you murdered Beth?!

24:51.620 --> 24:55.885
No, no. I was, um, I was going
to retrieve this.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.888
A check for five grand.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.369
I was worried that it would
lead the police to me.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.111
What was the money for?

25:04.154 --> 25:05.547
Felix is my best student.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.462
He's the best student
I've ever seen.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.333
The kid is destined
for stardom.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.597
I was hoping that
he'd take me with him.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.555
So, what? You were trying
to bribe Beth

25:13.599 --> 25:16.863
because she was helping him
to spend less time on violin

25:16.906 --> 25:18.168
and be more social?

25:18.212 --> 25:20.606
The opposite. Beth recommended
that he play more.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.478
Start homeschooling
and take private lessons,

25:23.522 --> 25:25.306
leaving me behind.

25:25.349 --> 25:28.701
So you were trying to bribe her
to change that recommendation.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.137
It still sounds
like motive.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.618
Well, I have an alibi.
Mm.

25:32.661 --> 25:35.316
I was teaching ninth grade
chamber class

25:35.359 --> 25:36.578
when Beth was murdered.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.275
You-you can call the school.

25:40.016 --> 25:43.498
If that's actually true,
then we're back to bupkes.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.326
Unless Dan got a lead
from Beckett.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.806
Beckett Wilson?

25:46.849 --> 25:49.373
Well, it figures that
she'd be involved.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.636
She a student of yours?

25:50.679 --> 25:52.681
Was. The kid's a nightmare.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.031
I nearly ran her over
this morning on her scooter.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.816
She was ditching first period.

25:56.859 --> 26:00.907
Where are Beckett
and Dan, anyhow?

26:00.950 --> 26:03.170
[tires screeching]What, Beckett?

26:03.213 --> 26:06.042
Yup. I'm looking right at her.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.522
Dan, where are you?

26:07.566 --> 26:09.437
You were supposed to be
at the precinct hours ago.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.352
I... uh, yeah.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.136
Sorry. Battery.[phone beeps]

[panting]: What,
you couldn't run?

26:15.051 --> 26:16.357
I mean, it is your car.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.012
Oh, I'll get it back,
unlike your dignity.

26:19.055 --> 26:22.189
I make mistakes, man.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.538
But guess what?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.584
So do you.
You're not perfect, you know.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.629
[chuckles]You know what, man?

26:27.673 --> 26:30.501
It's a big deal now.
All right?

26:30.545 --> 26:31.590
I just talked to Chloe.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.548
Beckett, she's a suspect.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.202
So we got to call in
some backup.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.683
Agreed. Agreed.

26:37.726 --> 26:41.295
And I think we both know who's
best at hunting down humans.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.471
No. No.

Um...

27:01.489 --> 27:04.535
[laughs] Let me
get this straight.

27:04.579 --> 27:09.236
So, you lost a 14-year-old kid
and she stole your badge

27:09.279 --> 27:14.110
and your car?
[laughs]

27:14.154 --> 27:15.634
It's annoying, isn't it?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.374

30:47.715 --> 30:50.500
Yeah. You're afraid that
people, even nice people,

30:50.544 --> 30:54.548
wouldn't accept people
who talk to dead people.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.463
But...
No but. Okay?

30:56.506 --> 30:58.682
You don't know what it's like
to tell someone the truth

30:58.726 --> 31:01.337
and have them look at you
with pity in their eyes

31:01.381 --> 31:03.035
like you're crazy.

31:04.514 --> 31:07.909
And if my friends here
ever looked at me like that,

31:07.953 --> 31:09.868
it would break my heart.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.217
I think your
coworkers here

31:11.260 --> 31:13.132
are real friends, like Chloe...

31:13.175 --> 31:15.525
Chloe is the nicest person ever.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.092
Okay? But she's all about things

31:17.136 --> 31:19.051
that she can see
and prove

31:19.094 --> 31:21.401
and I don't think
that she'd get it.

31:21.444 --> 31:26.580
And the truth is, I don't want
to give her the chance not to.

31:30.453 --> 31:31.585
Ray-Ray.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.717
The neighbors have
a construction dumpster.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.850
Holy smokes.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.554
You know, I love
your perfume.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.642
What is that? Freesia?

31:45.686 --> 31:48.776
Yes. Thank you.That music,

31:48.819 --> 31:50.038
it's beautiful.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.431
You must be so
proud of Felix.

31:51.474 --> 31:52.780
He's so talented.

31:52.823 --> 31:55.304
Well, he never puts
that violin down.
Really?

31:55.348 --> 31:57.872
My daughter, she goes through
interests like candy.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.830
I can't get her to
commit to anything.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.094
Commitment has never
been Felix's problem.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.791
He loves his violin.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.967
Once, he walked out the door
without pants,

32:06.011 --> 32:07.882
but he still
had his violin.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.275
[both laugh]

32:09.318 --> 32:12.365
So, he would never
leave it behind,

32:12.408 --> 32:13.932
like at a therapist's office?

32:13.975 --> 32:16.108
Oh, God no.
He sleeps with the thing.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.632
Hmm. And how
did you feel

32:18.675 --> 32:21.069
when Beth recommended that
Felix do homeschooling

32:21.113 --> 32:23.942
so he could play
violin full-time?

32:23.985 --> 32:26.466
I'm sorry,
but that's not right.

32:26.509 --> 32:29.251
Um, Beth recommended that
Felix stay in his school.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.949
In fact,
she was encouraging him

32:30.992 --> 32:34.039
to branch out
with new activities.

32:34.082 --> 32:37.607
At least,
that's what Anthony told me.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.045
And where is Anthony now?

32:44.049 --> 32:46.355
What the heck
are you doing?

32:46.399 --> 32:47.704
Where would you hide
a murder weapon?

32:47.748 --> 32:50.011
Not in your trash.
That is way too easy.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.360
Your neighbor's trash, maybe.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.362
But a construction dumpster?
Perfect.

32:53.406 --> 32:54.973
You're really good
at this stuff, you know.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.236
Even though it is, um, gross.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.716
Yeah. I mean,
this is my thang!

32:59.760 --> 33:01.196
And you know what they say.

33:01.240 --> 33:05.548
One man's trash is
a forensic scientist's treasure.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.510

33:10.553 --> 33:13.817

from the victim to boot.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.661
Lower the bat, Anthony.
It's over.

33:31.705 --> 33:34.577
We know Felix didn't leave
his violin at Beth's.

33:34.621 --> 33:35.839
He followed you there,

33:35.883 --> 33:39.060
and has been covering
for you ever since.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.410
You don't understand.

33:41.454 --> 33:45.545
I sent Felix to Beth
to help him,

33:45.588 --> 33:48.026
not make him worse.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.114
He doesn't have any friends.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.029
He doesn't have a life.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.248
"Play the violin more."

33:53.292 --> 33:55.076
That's not normal.

that's not normal.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.907
It's amazing.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.648
And that's what
makes him special.

I see ghosts.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.717
Well, more like "ghost."

34:27.761 --> 34:30.459
I see one ghost.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.461
Okay, um...

34:32.505 --> 34:35.247
I think I'm gonna need
a bit more.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.337
Okay, so...

34:38.380 --> 34:39.816
when I was eight years old,

34:39.860 --> 34:42.471
I was in a really,
really bad car wreck.

34:42.515 --> 34:46.388
And-and that's when I
saw her for the first time.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.391
And at first, I thought
she was just a figment

34:49.435 --> 34:52.307
of my imagination,
from the trauma.

34:52.351 --> 34:55.136
But she kept coming back.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.443
And-and-and then I thought

34:57.486 --> 34:59.358
she was just an
imaginary friend.

34:59.401 --> 35:02.839
But as I got older,
I realized

35:02.883 --> 35:05.494
that she wasn't imaginary,
she was real,

35:05.538 --> 35:10.543
because she felt so...
so real to me.

35:10.586 --> 35:14.373
And that's when she
told me she was a ghost.

35:14.416 --> 35:18.507
So I have a friend
who's a ghost.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.162
Or at least-- at least
I hope that's what she is,

35:21.206 --> 35:23.773
'cause if it really is
just all in my head,

35:23.817 --> 35:26.428
then I'm legit crazy.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.040
Do you think I'm crazy?

35:30.084 --> 35:32.608
No.

35:32.652 --> 35:35.307
It-It's...

35:35.350 --> 35:39.224
definitely
a-a lot to process...

35:39.267 --> 35:42.879
but no, Ella,
I don't think you're crazy.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.882
Honestly, I have seen

35:45.926 --> 35:50.539
a lot crazier things.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.368
Like, a lot.

35:53.412 --> 35:56.458
And besides,
there is nothing that...

35:56.502 --> 35:58.199
that you could tell me
that would change

35:58.243 --> 35:59.592

Oh, and any news
on the move to Detroit?

Told ya.

36:38.326 --> 36:41.024
See? I told you
your friends are great.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.157

The best.

36:43.201 --> 36:47.117
So... a deal's a deal.

36:47.161 --> 36:50.120
I said I would leave after,
uh, this case was closed,

36:50.164 --> 36:53.036
so I guess this is adios.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.518
Uh, wait...
question.

36:56.562 --> 36:59.042
If you say you're here
to look out for me,

36:59.086 --> 37:02.263
is that what you've been doing
since the car wreck?

37:02.307 --> 37:05.484
Sort of like a...
I don't know,

37:05.527 --> 37:07.790

You could say I'm just a
friend who's got your back.

37:10.967 --> 37:15.233
Well, I suppose you can
check on my back,

37:15.276 --> 37:17.626
you know, once in a while.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.281
But, seriously, don't
spy on me in the shower.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.283
Deal.

37:22.327 --> 37:25.634
Well, smell you later, Lopez.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.554
ELLA:
Uh, what is that?

37:32.598 --> 37:34.643
Well, I think
it speaks for itself,

37:34.687 --> 37:37.211
but unfortunately,
I'm sworn to secrecy.

that particular turn of phrase,

37:54.010 --> 37:55.316
"Smell you later"?

say that before.

are reserved for siblings

38:52.242 --> 38:53.635
Okay, I get it, you're pissed.

38:53.679 --> 38:54.984
I should have
reached out to you

38:55.028 --> 38:56.551
when Dad kicked your butt
down to Hell.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.945
And I was going to,
but, you know,

I-I didn't want to leave.

40:29.731 --> 40:30.863
I mean, you know Ella.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.299
There's just
something about her.

40:32.342 --> 40:35.215
She's so positive.
She makes you feel like...

Good about yourself.

Yeah! Exactly!

I only ever get to
talk to deadhumans.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.049
I mean, they're so morose.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.791
Anyway, whenever I was
in the neighborhood,

40:45.834 --> 40:48.489
I'd stop by, see
how she was doing,

40:48.533 --> 40:49.795
and we became friends.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.711

it's weird

40:52.754 --> 40:55.017
if people talk to
invisible angels.

40:55.061 --> 40:58.934
So I told her I was a ghost,
which didn't help.

40:58.978 --> 41:03.025
So I sent her to be
out here with you.

41:03.069 --> 41:06.464
You did what?

41:06.507 --> 41:08.727
First, Dad puts
the detective here,

41:08.770 --> 41:11.556
and now you're trying
to manipulate me with Ms. Lopez.

41:11.599 --> 41:14.559
Why does everyone think
I need help meeting women?

41:14.602 --> 41:18.388
Relax.
I-I didn't do it for you,

41:18.432 --> 41:19.825
I did it for her.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.698
Well, both of you, I guess.

41:23.742 --> 41:26.353
See, since I couldn't really
be with her,

41:26.396 --> 41:28.181
and I couldn't be with you,

41:28.224 --> 41:32.272

42:17.709 --> 42:19.667
with my good friend,
Ms. Lopez,

42:19.711 --> 42:22.757
as I just heard you'll be
staying with us a while longer.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.063
[chuckles]

42:24.106 --> 42:26.805
Excellent choice,
by the way.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.113
Yeah, I mean,
I was just, you know,

42:31.157 --> 42:33.551
comparing DNA on a block
of regular wood

42:33.594 --> 42:34.813
versus synthetic wood.

42:34.856 --> 42:36.684
Oh.
So, the cells
in the synthetic--

42:36.728 --> 42:38.686
Sorry, you were probably
just being polite.

42:38.730 --> 42:39.948
No, no, no, no.
Not at all.

42:39.992 --> 42:42.385
Please, tell me more.
I'm all ears.

42:42.429 --> 42:45.737
Oh, well, it's fascinating.

42:45.780 --> 42:48.609
See, the plastic
preserves the DNA.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.219
Right? But with
the regular wood,

42:50.263 --> 42:52.308
the cells get soaked up,
kind of like, um,

42:52.352 --> 42:54.659
like a parasite
fusing with its host, right?
