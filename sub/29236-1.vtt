00:56.190 --> 00:57.923
Gloria, what are you doing here?

00:57.925 --> 00:59.024
Go home.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.726
There ain't no home
to go back to.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.728
<i>Let me be. I got a job to do.</i>

01:02.730 --> 01:05.564
Why do you keep killing
all these people, Daddy?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.267
Everyone's leaving town.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.902
Go! Get away now!

01:09.904 --> 01:12.404
Who else has to die
before you stop?

01:14.141 --> 01:16.341
It's just one more killing,
sweetheart.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.843
Then it's done.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.380
Come on, boys! Let's go!

01:21.382 --> 01:23.282
It's open season on the freaks!

01:23.284 --> 01:27.519
We just want to leave town
with what we got left, Daddy,

01:27.521 --> 01:31.423
me and Mom and you.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.164
I told you, baby, go home.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.874
Mama said
she felt sorry for you.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.878
She said that minister
made you all crazy.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.817
Now these circus folk
ain't got no lives left,

01:58.819 --> 02:01.920
and we ain't got no lives left.

02:03.157 --> 02:06.925
And now you're gonna die, too.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.961
Bye, Daddy.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.197
Bye.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.668
After it! Kill him!

02:16.670 --> 02:18.670
There! There! Go!

02:18.672 --> 02:20.672
<i>In the door!
Open the door, baby!</i>

02:20.674 --> 02:21.807
No!

02:21.809 --> 02:24.810
Oh, no! No! Not my babies!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.913
- Please, not my babies!
- Got you now, freak mama!

02:31.719 --> 02:33.185
- This kid ain't dead yet.
- Mama!

02:33.187 --> 02:34.820
Yeah, that one's still alive.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.922
- Mama. Mama!
- Run, you freak boy!

02:36.924 --> 02:39.158
Murderer!

02:39.160 --> 02:41.693
The boy, he's getting away!

02:42.730 --> 02:44.463
Kill him!

03:07.655 --> 03:08.787
Hey, Bucky!

03:08.789 --> 03:10.489
Okay, you go on.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.426
You flush it out this way
right to me...

03:14.428 --> 03:16.361
and I promise you
I'll take care of it.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.530
But, Homer,
he's just a kid, ain't he?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.432
You call that thing a kid?!

03:21.569 --> 03:23.235
Ain't no kid.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.504
It's a murdering freak!

03:25.506 --> 03:27.606
<i>Murdering freak!
Murdering freak!</i>

03:27.608 --> 03:29.274
Got the Devil in him...

03:30.077 --> 03:32.344
just like the minister says.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.412
Okay, you go on.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.049
I know you're in there,
you little freak!

03:37.051 --> 03:39.017
Freak! ...Freak!

03:40.087 --> 03:43.789
We told you people to get out
a dozen times.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.457
You just had to stay.

03:46.961 --> 03:51.496
You just had to keep building
this sin-filled place, huh?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.665
Bigger and bigger,

03:53.667 --> 03:56.101
right in the middle of our town!

03:58.072 --> 03:59.538
Now it's gonna cost you,

03:59.540 --> 04:02.274
- just like it cost your mama...
- mama...

04:02.276 --> 04:04.509
- your brother...
- brother...

04:04.511 --> 04:06.645
everyone you ever cared about,

04:06.647 --> 04:08.447
- 'cause they're all dead now!
- Dead now!

04:08.449 --> 04:11.650
Just like you're gonna be
in about one minute.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.684
One minute... one minute.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.952
Yeah!

04:18.726 --> 04:22.394
<i>Did you get him, Homer?
Did you get him?</i>

04:36.410 --> 04:39.878
Davy! Davy!

04:44.485 --> 04:46.285
Davy!

04:48.555 --> 04:50.289
Davy!

04:55.796 --> 04:58.530
Come on, Davy!

04:59.533 --> 05:00.732
Haven't you peed already?!

05:00.734 --> 05:03.302
Hey. Hey, buddy.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.170
Hey, buddy.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.305
Davy!

05:06.307 --> 05:08.040
Hear us?!

05:11.245 --> 05:16.682
Davy! Hey, Davy!

05:16.684 --> 05:18.550
Hey, I thought
your little brother

05:18.552 --> 05:20.218
just had to take a piss.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.954
Some pisses take longer
than others. Know what I mean?

05:22.956 --> 05:24.489
Lay off, guys.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.957
Or what, meatball?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.327
Whoa, Jillian,

05:28.329 --> 05:30.062
have you seen Davy's new post?

05:30.064 --> 05:31.997
It's awesome.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.699
Yeah, I got it, too.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.600
Yeah, me, too.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.545
What's he doing out there,

05:46.547 --> 05:47.813
some kind of nature show?

05:47.815 --> 05:50.115
Hey, why don't you give
me and Marcus our tickets?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.717
We'll meet you guys
at the concert.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.019
<i>It's not a concert, dummies.
It's a music festival.</i>

05:54.021 --> 05:55.420
<i>Yeah, whatever.
Chuck and I are sick</i>

05:55.422 --> 05:57.189
of wasting time
on your stupid shortcuts.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.291
<i>Go. I don't want to drive
with you guys, anyway.</i>

05:59.293 --> 06:00.759
All you guys talk about
is sports.

06:00.761 --> 06:04.129
<i>Wait. You can't leave, guys.
We need both cars.</i>

06:04.131 --> 06:06.064
I can just ride
on top of the coolers.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.232
- Whoo!
- Hey!

06:07.234 --> 06:08.500
We gettin' out of here, my boy.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.135
- Yeah we are. Later, losers.
- Sorry, guys,

06:10.137 --> 06:12.371
but my little sister is
not riding on top of a cooler.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.406
Guys, guys,
Davy's made a few posts,

06:14.408 --> 06:16.641
so you might want
to check it out.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.642
They're really cool.

06:17.644 --> 06:18.910
Ah. Yeah, there it is.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.947
Yeah, look. More lizards.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.982
This is B.S.!

06:33.794 --> 06:35.994
Hold still, you little bugger.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.537
He's not responding
to any of my texts.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.339
We should go look for him.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.209
Come on. Why don't you come out?

06:51.211 --> 06:55.814
Um, are there gonna be snakes?

06:55.816 --> 06:57.649
Yeah, probably.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.584
No. I'll pass.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.555
Okay.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.589
Come on. Lead the way.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.691
Let's go, guys.

07:06.693 --> 07:07.993
Wait for me.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.230
Davy!

07:14.234 --> 07:15.834
- Davy!
- Davy!

07:15.836 --> 07:18.003
- Davy!
- Come on, Davy!

07:18.005 --> 07:19.971
Davy!

07:19.973 --> 07:22.007
- Haven't you peed already?
- Come on!

07:22.009 --> 07:24.843
- Come on, Davy!
- Davy!

07:24.845 --> 07:26.278
- Davy!
- Davy!

07:26.280 --> 07:27.446
Sweet.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.751
- Davy!
- Davy!

07:32.753 --> 07:34.686
- We'll miss the concert!
- Come on, dude!

07:34.688 --> 07:37.456
- We're gonna leave your ass!
- We're gonna miss the festival!

07:37.458 --> 07:39.024
- Watch out.
- Where are you, Davy?!

07:39.026 --> 07:40.992
Hey, yo, Davy!

07:40.994 --> 07:43.228
Davy!

07:44.031 --> 07:46.465
Fine. I guess, whatever.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.770
Guys! Guys, wait up!

07:53.640 --> 07:55.373
Come on, guys.

08:08.489 --> 08:11.957
Davy, you little butt-hole,
where are you?!

08:11.959 --> 08:14.125
- Where are we?
- Guys!

08:14.127 --> 08:16.461
- Yo, Davy!
- Guys, I saw a snake,

08:16.463 --> 08:19.698
- and I wasn't even scared!
- Bullshit.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.621
- Come check this out.
- I'm coming.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.858
- Hey, come check this out.
- What?! What is it?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.627
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

08:48.629 --> 08:49.861
Look, look, look.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.630
- Waah!
- Waah!

08:52.933 --> 08:54.299
Guys, it's not cool.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.134
- Come on, Kody.
- Come on, Kody!

08:56.136 --> 08:59.304
It looks your brother
found himself a town.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.773
Looks like a ghost town.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.594
Hello!

10:03.103 --> 10:04.536
Creepy.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.244
Hello?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.423
Who's there?!

10:38.238 --> 10:39.638
- Ugh.
- Stop.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.507
Nature sucks. I hate this place.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.442
Yeah. I mean, for a small boy...

10:44.444 --> 10:46.578
- Davy, come on!
- He can go very fast.

10:46.580 --> 10:47.612
Man...

10:59.526 --> 11:00.759
Hello?

11:04.931 --> 11:06.898
No.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.286
Whoa. Creepy.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.130
Hello?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.703
Austin?

11:45.605 --> 11:47.338
Bro!

11:47.340 --> 11:48.773
Is that you?!

11:51.845 --> 11:53.044
Gordy?

11:55.082 --> 11:56.181
Kody?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.049
This isn't funny!

12:06.359 --> 12:08.693
Chill out, man.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.667
Chill out, man.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.073
Davy!

12:22.075 --> 12:24.676
This has got to be
the longest pee in the world.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.177
No, we're gonna find him soon.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.345
Where could he be, though?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.813
Well, I barely
have any reception.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.284
- Davy!
- Davy!

12:33.286 --> 12:35.120
Come on, Davy! Let's go!

12:38.425 --> 12:41.826
<i>Come on, Davy!
We don't have all day!</i>

13:02.816 --> 13:04.949
What's up with these clowns?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.026
No way.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.844
Ladies first.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.634
Oh.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.940
Hello?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.015
Hello?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.864
Chill out, man.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.890
Put it on my tab.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.539
Welcome to the Fun House.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.408
Cool.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.778
Enter, if you dare.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.019
Welcome to the Fun House.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.090
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.</i>

16:45.138 --> 16:46.904
Davy!

16:47.974 --> 16:49.574
Come on, Davy.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.844
- Where are we?
- Davy!

17:06.760 --> 17:08.659
This place is way too weird.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.064
Guys, this is the place
from Davy's picture.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.932
Maybe Davy went
back to the cars.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.734
Or maybe he got kidnapped or
fell into a well or something.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.338
I did see missing person photos

17:20.339 --> 17:22.773
back at that gas station,
like, 20 miles back.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.675
Yeah, there were 20 of them,
all for kids our age.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.878
Hey, guys, come check this out.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.951
Have any of you ever heard
of the Nevada Triangle?

17:33.953 --> 17:35.953
Is that like
the Bermuda Triangle?

17:35.955 --> 17:38.389
Yeah, but, according to this,
it's worse.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.260
There's UFOs, planes vanishing,
people disappearing.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.594
It's all junk.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.729
- You think so?
- Yep.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.097
You're wrong.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.666
Davy!

17:48.668 --> 17:50.134
Come on, man!

17:51.171 --> 17:52.670
He's out here. We'll find him.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.508
- Davy, come on!
- Are you serious?

17:57.510 --> 17:58.609
Davy!

17:58.611 --> 18:00.445
Dave-O, come back here, asshole!

18:00.447 --> 18:02.447
Asshole is right.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.982
Come on, Davy! Let's go!

18:04.984 --> 18:06.350
We're gonna miss the concert!

18:06.352 --> 18:08.352
<i>Wait. Don't you
mean "music festival"?</i>

18:08.354 --> 18:10.088
Davy!

18:11.124 --> 18:12.890
Guys, wait up!

18:27.974 --> 18:30.341
I literally have
no reception, guys.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.909
- Hello?
- Wow.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.911
This place is ancient.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.352
Do you think this place
could be, uh, radioactive?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.621
Should I Google "radiation"?

18:43.623 --> 18:44.856
Soda!

18:44.858 --> 18:47.125
Except there's nothing at all.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.027
- Soda!
- You're not getting anything?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.229
No.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.263
Try over here.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.237
Why don't I have reception,
but you do?

18:59.239 --> 19:02.006
I downloaded the pages
when we were lower down.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.208
Whoa.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.643
This is crazy.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.812
- Yo, hey, yo.
- Oh.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.949
Doesn't open? What the hell?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.751
Yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo! Take a pic.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.052
Yeah, I got you, brother.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.990
<i>Take it... Different pose.
Different pose.</i>

19:20.059 --> 19:21.492
Yeah. Get me. Get me. Get me.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.960
<i>Get me. Get me.
Get me. Hey, man.</i>

19:24.397 --> 19:25.830
<i>All right. A'right.
A'right. A'right. A'right.</i>

19:25.832 --> 19:27.265
A'right. A'right. Hey.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.666
<i>All right, come on.
Switch it up.</i>

19:28.668 --> 19:30.635
Switch it up.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.336
Hey, Sarah.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.240
My sister speaks yet again.

19:36.242 --> 19:39.911
Sorry, but I think
I might know where we are,

19:39.913 --> 19:42.914
- like, what this place is.
- What do you mean?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.315
I've been looking it up.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.450
I think there was
a real town here.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.451
Hey, guys.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.253
Guys, come check this out.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.522
You can see on the map,

19:51.524 --> 19:52.857
but there was
a riot or something,

19:52.859 --> 19:55.326
and now the whole place
is just abandoned.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.630
It happened, like, 25 years ago.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.465
This whole area
is off limits now,

20:01.467 --> 20:03.034
that road we were on, too.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.570
It's like one of those weird
mystery shows or something.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.271
Awesome.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.576
Well, I did see
a "Do not enter" sign

20:11.578 --> 20:14.011
at the front of the road there.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.880
Why didn't you tell us,
ass-wipe?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.949
- I don't know. I just forgot.
- Shut up, Gordy.

20:17.951 --> 20:19.483
Yeah, butt-whiff. Shut up.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.886
Guys, I think we maybe should
just keep looking for Davy.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.855
<i>No. Look,
you guys stay here, okay?</i>

20:24.857 --> 20:26.891
I'm gonna go look
for my brother.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.327
- You can't go off by yourself.
- Davy!

20:30.830 --> 20:32.563
Davy!

20:32.565 --> 20:33.864
Are you serious?

20:33.866 --> 20:36.000
Look toward this way!

20:36.002 --> 20:38.869
<i>H-Hey, guys!
I think I found something!</i>

20:40.406 --> 20:42.473
Oh, my God.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.478
Davy?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.879
Bro, is that you?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.982
Hey, guys!

20:51.818 --> 20:54.485
Guys! I think he's down here!

21:00.793 --> 21:02.994
- He's not posting anymore.
- I swear I just heard him.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.462
Anyone else think that's weird?

21:04.464 --> 21:05.363
For Davy, yeah.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.531
Think he actually went in there?

21:07.533 --> 21:09.033
This place is creepy.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.468
He totally went in.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.903
- Yeah.
- I'm not going near that thing.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.438
Yeah, I-I'm with him.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.474
Are you serious?

21:16.476 --> 21:17.642
I'll go in.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.076
Me, too.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.845
I-If that's okay with you.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.281
If Sarah goes in, I'll go in.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.084
Well, I guess I'll go in.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.288
Okay.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.264
Hey, I found a door,
but it's locked.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.300
Let's use our eyes, Austin.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.370
Go, Sally.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.241
Here we are.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.148
Now where... where do I put it?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.217
So stupid.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.858
Welcome to the Fun House.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.631
Enter, if you dare.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.199
No. No friggin' way.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.434
- Yeah. Yeah, no.
- No.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.074
- Wow.
- Yeah, I thought

22:23.076 --> 22:26.377
you football guys
were supposed to be "tough."

22:26.379 --> 22:28.479
Come on, girls.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.247
Let's go find Davy.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.122
Kody! Kody!

22:41.527 --> 22:43.194
You only live once.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.374
Why don't you
find something to...

22:56.376 --> 22:58.376
To keep the door
from closing in on us?

23:06.085 --> 23:08.819
Guys, wait up.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.287
Does this work?

23:10.289 --> 23:12.990
Perfect. Do the honors.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.377
Take my hand.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.746
Everybody with me?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.014
I'm in.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.015
We're here.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.049
Me, too.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.318
- Jillian?
- Right behind you.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.554
Sally and I are in the back.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.058
Something creepy
just touched me.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.727
Gordy, is that you grabbing me?

23:49.729 --> 23:50.828
Nope.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.263
And this is supposed to be fun?

23:53.366 --> 23:55.166
Don't waste
your batteries, okay?

23:55.168 --> 23:56.300
We have enough light, okay?

23:56.302 --> 23:58.002
We need to keep
our phones charged.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.037
Yeah, so we can order
a pizza or something.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.872
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.607
Okay, okay.

24:05.344 --> 24:08.879
Hey, there's a left up here.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.247
Watch your step.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.320
- Watch your step.
- Watch out.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.122
The floor's moving right here.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.559
Beware of the floor.

24:21.561 --> 24:25.296
<i>The walls are steel-reinforced.
There is no way out.</i>

24:25.298 --> 24:28.399
- Way out... way out.
- Yo, this place is all lit up.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.067
Must be getting power
from somewhere.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.403
Yo, what's over there?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.272
It's a f-fork.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.156
Man, go, go, go.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.826
Wait. Shh. Shh.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.262
Do you hear that?

24:59.065 --> 25:00.297
Did you hear that?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.602
Whoa!

25:04.604 --> 25:06.070
Run! Run! Run!

25:10.243 --> 25:12.676
- Watch out! Move.
- Go! Go! Go!

25:12.678 --> 25:14.278
- Go!
- Wrong way!

25:14.280 --> 25:15.880
- Jillian!
- No, turn! Go!

25:15.882 --> 25:17.114
- Go back! Go back!
- Austin!

25:17.116 --> 25:19.083
Come on, guys! Go! Go! Go!

25:19.085 --> 25:20.618
Watch your step.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.686
He's coming! Oh, my God!

25:22.688 --> 25:25.289
Everybody, calm down! Quiet.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.961
Hey, what was
that thing back there?

25:30.963 --> 25:32.563
It was some kind of clown.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.064
- A clown?
- It's probably just

25:34.066 --> 25:36.200
some fun-house hologram
meant to freak us out.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.402
<i>I don't care what it was.
I want to go home.</i>

25:38.404 --> 25:40.804
<i>I agree. Let's get out of here.</i>

25:40.806 --> 25:42.006
You guys can go,

25:42.008 --> 25:43.741
but I'm gonna stay
and look for Davy.

25:43.743 --> 25:44.909
Yeah, I'm staying, too.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.745
Anybody else? Jillian?

25:47.747 --> 25:49.046
Not me.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.281
Okay, Marcus?

25:50.283 --> 25:52.650
No way.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.451
Kody?

25:54.453 --> 25:55.819
Kody?

25:55.821 --> 25:57.388
Kody?

25:57.390 --> 25:58.889
<i>Oh, his mom's gonna be pissed.</i>

25:58.891 --> 26:01.825
<i>Wait. Here. I-I found
the number for the fun house.</i>

26:01.827 --> 26:03.394
Sarah, call this.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.496
<i>It's ringing.
I'll put it on speaker.</i>

26:05.498 --> 26:08.465
You have reached the Gaspari
Fun House, Circus, and Maze.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.935
You may leave a message
at the beep...

26:10.937 --> 26:12.303
- Leave one.
- If you dare.

26:12.305 --> 26:13.504
Okay.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.206
Hi. Um...

26:16.208 --> 26:18.309
yeah, we're here
in your fun house,

26:18.311 --> 26:22.346
and we seem to be missing
two members of our party.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.615
<i>Uh, they're lost.
I was wondering if you could...</i>

26:26.819 --> 26:31.589
<i>Okay. At least you
have service, so, uh, call Davy.</i>

26:31.591 --> 26:32.823
Okay.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.994
It's ringing.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.129
You have reached the Gaspari...

26:39.131 --> 26:40.397
Called the fun house again.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.800
No, I didn't. I swear.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.969
I don't like this.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.071
Call me.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.372
Okay.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.575
You have reached the Gaspari...

26:51.577 --> 26:53.611
Y-Yeah. Yeah, we're out of here.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.546
Yeah, we'll meet you guys
back at the car.

26:55.548 --> 26:57.848
<i>Come on, guys.
We have two missing kids here.</i>

26:57.850 --> 26:59.483
Whatever.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.352
Well, at least look for Kody
on your way back.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.520
<i>Come on, bitch.
Race you back on three.</i>

27:03.522 --> 27:04.888
- All right. You're on.
- Three!

27:04.890 --> 27:06.490
Assholes.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.927
So now what,
after that phone business?

27:09.929 --> 27:12.329
They must be
intercepting calls, right?

27:12.331 --> 27:13.697
I mean, what else could it be?

27:13.699 --> 27:15.733
Well, hopefully Chuck
and Marcus run into Kody.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.535
I say we continue
looking for Davy. Okay?

27:19.538 --> 27:21.271
Okay.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.973
Come on, Gordy.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.274
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.476
Okay.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.180
Too slow, Chucky boy!

27:30.182 --> 27:31.682
Wait! Wait!

27:31.684 --> 27:35.586
<i>Something's...
Something's different.</i>

27:35.588 --> 27:38.455
<i>Where... Where are we?
Where's the exit, man?</i>

27:39.792 --> 27:41.859
- I-I don't remember this.
- Okay, okay.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.661
I don't remember this
when we came in.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.195
I-It was darker. It was darker.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.698
<i>Okay. Okay.
Which way, right or left?</i>

27:47.700 --> 27:48.899
Come on!

27:48.901 --> 27:50.300
Wh-What do you want me to do?!

27:50.302 --> 27:51.435
We're lost! We've been circling!

27:51.437 --> 27:52.836
You're the quarterback!

27:52.838 --> 27:55.072
<i>You know what to do, man!
Just think!</i>

27:55.074 --> 27:57.241
- Screw you!
- Just think!

27:57.243 --> 27:58.909
Come here! Just think!

27:58.911 --> 28:01.345
- Just think! Come on!
- I don't know! I don't know!

28:01.347 --> 28:02.713
Look! Look! Right! Right!

28:02.715 --> 28:05.249
<i>All right. Hey, hey,
don't go too fast! Come on.</i>

28:05.251 --> 28:06.417
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

28:06.419 --> 28:07.951
Keep up! Keep up! Keep up.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.856
We're definitely lost!

28:12.858 --> 28:15.059
No, no, no. No.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.561
<i>No, something... something
is completely different!</i>

28:17.563 --> 28:19.329
We should have just stayed
with the others!

28:19.331 --> 28:21.598
<i>What? And be a yes-man
to that bitch, Austin,</i>

28:21.600 --> 28:24.835
<i>and his fat-boy sidekick?
Nah, not me.</i>

28:24.837 --> 28:26.437
<i>I-I'm just saying.
I'm quarterback.</i>

28:26.439 --> 28:28.939
<i>You're linebacker.
You get hit a lot.</i>

28:28.941 --> 28:30.741
You have brain damage!

28:30.743 --> 28:32.309
Piss off.

28:34.447 --> 28:35.579
What's that for?

28:35.581 --> 28:38.048
So we can find our way back.

28:43.956 --> 28:47.991
<i>Beware. The walls are shifting.</i>

28:51.931 --> 28:54.131
I think we've been
this way before.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.399
No, that's impossible.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.734
No. No, she's right.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.635
There's another one
of your arrows.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.241
<i>Shh! Shh! Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.</i>

29:11.016 --> 29:12.449
Do you guys see him?

29:13.452 --> 29:14.685
Do you see him?

29:16.689 --> 29:17.721
I see him.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.490
Guys, I'm starting
to get scared.

29:19.492 --> 29:21.325
I know, sweetie,
but we'll be home soon.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.127
We just have to find the boys.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.194
Who is that guy?

29:24.196 --> 29:26.663
Maybe a custodian?

29:26.665 --> 29:29.032
Probably some big old squatter
that got into the makeup kit.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.034
<i>Hey, we see you, man!
It's not funny!</i>

29:31.036 --> 29:33.604
I mean, whoever he is,
he's keeping this place

29:33.606 --> 29:35.672
ready and open
in the middle of nowhere.

29:35.674 --> 29:36.907
Well, like Sally said before,

29:36.909 --> 29:39.076
it wasn't always
the middle of nowhere.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.446
I bet he's a psycho cannibal.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.182
<i>Okay, can you just stop?
You're scaring her.</i>

29:45.184 --> 29:46.283
Yeah. Sorry.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.284
Just focus, Gordy.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.685
- Yeah, focus.
- Come on.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.390
Where'd he go?

29:58.430 --> 29:59.863
I'm not sure.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.735
<i>Quiet. Quiet.
Stay down. Stay down.</i>

30:10.776 --> 30:12.342
Down.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.677
Stay down.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.147
What's he doing?

30:20.653 --> 30:22.953
Do you think
he knows we're here?

30:22.955 --> 30:24.521
Obviously he does.

30:24.523 --> 30:25.789
Maybe the emergency
phone lines are open.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.458
- I'm gonna try calling 911.
- Yeah.

30:30.763 --> 30:35.232
There's only one hotspot,
and it's called "Clown-child,"

30:35.234 --> 30:36.967
and it has a password.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.404
Do you guys see that?

30:40.406 --> 30:42.739
I-Is it moving?

30:42.741 --> 30:44.975
Yo, something's in that bag.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.144
What's he doing?

30:47.146 --> 30:49.746
- Guys, I...
- It's Kody. It's Kody.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.448
<i>Oh, my God. What should we do?</i>

30:52.618 --> 30:55.419
- Oh, my God.
- Aah! Guys! Guys!

30:55.421 --> 30:57.754
- What should we do?
- Guys, help! No.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.424
We need to get back
to the cars and call the police!

31:00.426 --> 31:03.460
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.829
He killed the lights!

31:05.831 --> 31:09.700
Everybody stay calm!

31:09.702 --> 31:12.169
It's trapdoor time.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.470
Guys, where'd you go?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.571
Watch your step.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.547
Come on, guys! Come on!

31:23.549 --> 31:25.682
Sally?!

31:25.684 --> 31:28.485
Sarah, where are you?

31:28.487 --> 31:30.554
Austin? Sarah?

31:30.556 --> 31:33.490
- Sally?! Sally?!
- Come on! Come on!

31:33.492 --> 31:36.226
- Gordy! Gordy!
- Come on! Come on!

31:36.228 --> 31:37.694
Come on!

31:44.403 --> 31:45.736
Austin?

31:49.308 --> 31:50.440
Beware.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.342
- The walls are shifting.
- Austin!

31:52.344 --> 31:55.245
Sarah, are you here?

32:04.623 --> 32:06.490
Watch out for trapdoors.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.226
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

32:09.228 --> 32:11.595
- There is no way out.
- Sally!

32:11.597 --> 32:12.596
- What?!
- It won't budge!

32:12.598 --> 32:13.830
Where'd you go, Austin?

32:13.832 --> 32:15.399
The walls are steel reinforced.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.401
<i>Hold on, Sally! I'm gonna
find another way around, okay?</i>

32:17.403 --> 32:18.769
- Where are you going?
- Sally, just stay

32:18.771 --> 32:20.103
- where you are!
- You can't leave me! Austin!

32:20.105 --> 32:21.371
You can't leave me here!

32:21.373 --> 32:23.540
These walls are steel.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.443
There is no way out.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.612
It's trapdoor time.

32:35.955 --> 32:39.856
Austin? Sarah?

32:39.858 --> 32:41.024
Anybody?

32:42.361 --> 32:45.829
There is no way out.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.812
Please. Please.

33:01.814 --> 33:05.048
There is no way out for you.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.522
Austin!

33:12.524 --> 33:15.359
<i>Beware. The walls are shifting.</i>

33:17.129 --> 33:19.162
<i>I've got to get out.
I've got to get out.</i>

33:29.608 --> 33:31.141
Mama.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.858
Hi! You're my new best friend!

33:47.860 --> 33:49.359
Don't ever leave me!

34:46.318 --> 34:49.753
You know, maybe that clown
didn't hit Kody so hard.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.621
It's probably, like,
just a trick

34:51.623 --> 34:53.123
to trick the trespassers
or something.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.092
<i>Agh! Stop talking
about Kody, okay?!</i>

34:55.094 --> 34:58.028
I cannot focus on any more
when I lost my sister.

34:58.030 --> 35:00.697
<i>I just... We need to find her
and get out of here</i>

35:00.699 --> 35:03.133
and call the police! Now, okay?!

35:03.135 --> 35:05.135
Austin and Sally are just fine.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.438
<i>Look. Th-There's an arrow
right here.</i>

35:08.440 --> 35:09.473
- Look. Look.
- Really?

35:09.475 --> 35:10.841
- Yeah!
- Yes, yes, yes, good.

35:10.843 --> 35:13.076
<i>This is good. We can get there
and call the police.</i>

35:13.078 --> 35:15.312
- Go that way. Go. Go, then.
- Okay.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.415
Think we're good.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.887
<i>There it is. There it is.
That's the way.</i>

35:23.889 --> 35:25.655
Th-That's the cave
that we came through.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.457
Okay, okay, okay.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.436
Please just leave us alone.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.757
Which way is it?

36:00.759 --> 36:02.359
I can't remember.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.193
Gordy, help me!

36:03.195 --> 36:05.228
<i>Listen. Listen, Sarah.
Calm down.</i>

36:05.230 --> 36:07.097
I think Austin's
taking care of Sally right now

36:07.099 --> 36:08.131
and everything's just fine.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.833
Let's think like gamers, okay?

36:09.835 --> 36:11.501
L-Let's visualize this
in our heads.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.802
- Okay.
- All right. All right.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.171
<i>Look, look.
There's a passage right there.</i>

36:14.173 --> 36:16.173
- Okay, then, let's go!
- Yeah.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.174
Let's go!

36:17.176 --> 36:19.910
Beware of shifting walls.

37:01.253 --> 37:04.054
<i>Please, please, please, God.
Just get us out of here.</i>

37:04.056 --> 37:06.656
Come on. If you can...

37:12.064 --> 37:14.497
<i>Oh, no.
We have to find her, okay?</i>

37:14.499 --> 37:15.699
We have to find her, because...

37:15.701 --> 37:17.634
Oh, my Gosh.

37:17.636 --> 37:21.004
We should just forget mapping
this place out and go find them.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.672
<i>We have to keep going.
Let's keep going</i>

37:22.674 --> 37:24.007
and make sure
we find them, okay?

37:24.009 --> 37:25.208
I-It's gonna be okay.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.511
Look. Look. This might be a way.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.580
See anything back there?

37:30.582 --> 37:33.250
Um, I'll try... I'll try this.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.920
- It's...
- Is it another way?

37:36.922 --> 37:38.855
I-I think so. Give me...

37:38.857 --> 37:39.889
- Go check it out!
- Okay!

37:42.060 --> 37:44.461
Gordy, why did it shut?

37:44.463 --> 37:47.364
Gordy, what is going on in...

37:47.366 --> 37:49.266
Are you okay?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.484
Ahh! Psychopath!

38:23.468 --> 38:25.035
- Gordy, answer me!
- Let go of me!

38:25.037 --> 38:26.403
- Aah! My ankle!
- Gordy, wait!

38:26.405 --> 38:29.139
Why won't this open?

38:29.141 --> 38:32.142
Gordy, it's stuck! It's stuck!

38:33.345 --> 38:36.346
<i>Whammy! You just got bamboozled!</i>

38:36.348 --> 38:37.614
Ow.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.682
What happened? What happened?

38:38.684 --> 38:41.818
I-I think I may have, um...
What?

38:41.820 --> 38:42.952
I'm so sorry. Here. Here.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.287
<i>Put your...
Put your arm around me.</i>

38:44.289 --> 38:45.689
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Come on.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.590
<i>Okay, I'm going.
Wow, you're really short.</i>

38:47.592 --> 38:49.726
I know, but, like,
I just really don't know

38:49.728 --> 38:51.127
what else to do to help you.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.295
- I'm trying. Oh...
- Come on. Like...

38:52.297 --> 38:54.297
- Go forward, then!
- Oh!

38:54.299 --> 38:55.632
Ow!

38:55.634 --> 38:58.835
<i>Oh, my gosh. I know!
I'm sorry, but, please,</i>

38:58.837 --> 39:00.370
we have to move, Gordy, please!

39:00.372 --> 39:02.372
You cannot keep screaming!

39:02.374 --> 39:04.774
Oh, my goodness, can you,
like, help me a little bit?

39:04.776 --> 39:07.077
<i>I'm trying!
I'm trying to... It's my leg!</i>

39:07.079 --> 39:08.445
This is really difficult, okay?

39:09.514 --> 39:12.982
- Just go! Please, Gordy, go!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

39:12.984 --> 39:15.151
Gordy, you're killing me here.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.853
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my gosh. We're gonna fall.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.588
<i>All right.
I think it's this way.</i>

39:18.590 --> 39:20.390
Come on. Let's go.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.424
Come on!

39:30.702 --> 39:33.870
Hello?

39:46.752 --> 39:47.917
Hello?

39:47.919 --> 39:50.220
Austin? Austin?

41:25.717 --> 41:27.183
Mama.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.193
Mommy.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.600
Mommy, hold me.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.140
I love you, Mommy.

41:58.984 --> 42:01.451
Hold me, Mommy.

42:01.453 --> 42:02.719
Mommy.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.421
Mommy.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.838
Hold me, Mommy.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.375
I love you, Mommy.

42:25.377 --> 42:29.479
Mama.

42:30.482 --> 42:32.916
Mama.

42:32.918 --> 42:35.184
- Mama.
- Mama.

42:35.186 --> 42:38.054
- Mama. Mama.
- Mama. Mama.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.256
Mama.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.896
Don't leave me.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.565
Hold me.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.800
- Mama.
- Somebody help!

42:50.802 --> 42:52.936
I'm in here! Please!

42:52.938 --> 42:54.270
- Mommy.
- Don't leave me.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.939
- Mama.
- Hold me.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.840
No.

42:59.177 --> 43:02.211
- I'm so hungry, Mommy.
- No.

43:02.213 --> 43:05.214
- I'm so hungry.
- No! No! No!

43:06.551 --> 43:09.419
Please. Please. Please.

43:09.421 --> 43:11.187
- Stop, please!
- Don't leave me, Mommy.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.222
- Don't leave!
- No, please!

43:16.194 --> 43:17.493
Aah! Ow!

43:17.495 --> 43:20.063
Mommy!

43:20.065 --> 43:22.298
Don't leave, Mommy.

43:22.300 --> 43:26.169
- Help!
- Hungry. Hungry.

43:31.009 --> 43:33.209
Mommy!

43:33.211 --> 43:35.044
Help!

43:35.046 --> 43:39.248
Hold me, Mommy.

43:39.250 --> 43:43.252
Don't leave me.

43:53.865 --> 43:56.866
No! No! No! No!

43:56.868 --> 43:59.268
No! No!

44:03.208 --> 44:05.541
Don't leave me.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.047
Mommy, don't leave me.

44:59.698 --> 45:02.331
<i>I can't... I can't help you.</i>

45:04.302 --> 45:07.537
Why do...

45:24.556 --> 45:26.923
<i>Oh, shit.
Tell me this is a way out.</i>

45:36.601 --> 45:38.367
<i>I can't walk anymore.
I need to stop!</i>

45:38.369 --> 45:40.570
<i>Just a little further.
Look. The Tunnel of Love!</i>

45:40.572 --> 45:42.605
<i>We can ride this back out.
Let me help you get in.</i>

45:42.607 --> 45:44.974
Come on. Quick. Climb in.

45:45.977 --> 45:47.643
Gordy, hurry up.

46:09.634 --> 46:10.933
A bag.

46:20.845 --> 46:21.944
Okay.

46:23.848 --> 46:24.848
Lighter.

46:33.892 --> 46:35.091
Okay.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.478
No! No!

47:31.182 --> 47:34.150
No, no.

47:34.152 --> 47:36.118
No. No.

47:36.120 --> 47:39.155
No! Please, let go.

47:46.231 --> 47:47.763
Yo, this place is crazy, bro.

47:47.765 --> 47:50.166
It's crazy.

47:50.168 --> 47:51.200
Whoa.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.401
Hey, watch your step.

47:53.805 --> 47:56.172
Hey, do you hear that? Shh.

47:57.942 --> 47:59.141
I'm trippin'.

48:08.019 --> 48:10.152
<i>Oh! Close it.
Close it, bro. Close it.</i>

48:11.256 --> 48:14.090
- Hey, we got a toilet.
- Ohh.

48:14.092 --> 48:15.491
Some toilet.

48:15.493 --> 48:16.759
- Watch... Watch your step.
- Okay.

48:16.761 --> 48:18.294
There's nails and stuff
on the floor.

48:18.296 --> 48:20.529
Just... Just be careful, bro.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.231
This place is creepy.

48:23.534 --> 48:27.036
Uh, this is so old.

48:27.038 --> 48:30.506
<i>Yeah, man. I'm not...
I'm not feeling it.</i>

48:30.508 --> 48:33.042
I'm not... This is weird.

48:36.381 --> 48:39.615
Oh. Somebody sleeps here.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.151
Yo, there's a bed.

48:43.955 --> 48:45.087
I got booze, bro!

48:45.089 --> 48:46.255
Ah, you gonna drink that?

48:46.257 --> 48:48.224
Come on. I got to drive.

48:48.226 --> 48:50.860
"I got to drive."
<i>Yeah, whatever.</i>

48:50.862 --> 48:52.295
Whatever, man. Give me some.

48:52.297 --> 48:53.829
Go ahead.

49:00.371 --> 49:02.204
It's lit?

49:06.945 --> 49:08.744
If someone's sleeping here,
there's got to be an exit

49:08.746 --> 49:10.780
or entrance
somewhere else around here.

49:10.782 --> 49:12.248
Good thinking, dummy!

49:12.250 --> 49:14.116
Maybe you don't have
so much brain damage after all!

49:14.118 --> 49:16.886
<i>Hey, yo, screw you!
I'm gonna find a way outta here.</i>

49:18.823 --> 49:21.057
I think I found a door.

49:27.398 --> 49:28.631
- Shit!
- What?!

49:28.633 --> 49:29.932
- Go! Go! Run! Look out!
- What?!

49:29.934 --> 49:31.534
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

49:31.536 --> 49:33.202
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

49:33.204 --> 49:34.603
- What, bro?
- Yo, come on!

49:34.605 --> 49:36.138
I saw him! He's coming!

49:36.140 --> 49:38.641
<i>He's coming right now!
I swear! He's only...</i>

49:38.643 --> 49:39.875
- Yo, calm down!
- What do we do?

49:39.877 --> 49:42.244
<i>Calm down! Calm down!
Look, look, look!</i>

49:42.246 --> 49:44.347
<i>We can take him! I'm QB!
You're linebacker, remember?</i>

49:44.349 --> 49:46.048
- Are you sure?
- Ready?

49:46.050 --> 49:47.950
<i>Yo, I'm ready. I'm ready.
I'm ready. I'm ready.</i>

49:47.952 --> 49:49.352
1, 2, 3!

49:54.726 --> 49:57.226
Ahh! Where is he?!

49:57.228 --> 50:00.096
<i>I don't know!
I-I can't see anything!</i>

50:00.098 --> 50:03.065
- He's behind us! Chuck!
- Where are you?!

50:03.067 --> 50:05.501
Freak.

50:05.503 --> 50:06.635
Marcus!

50:06.637 --> 50:07.703
Wait! Wait! Yo, yo!

50:07.705 --> 50:09.238
I think I see a way out!

50:11.909 --> 50:14.210
Through this "barrel of laughs."

50:14.212 --> 50:15.511
Come on! Come on!

50:15.513 --> 50:18.114
<i>Come on! I think
we can get through here!</i>

50:20.651 --> 50:23.419
Marcus! Marcus, where are you?!

50:23.421 --> 50:24.887
Turn it off!

50:24.889 --> 50:26.756
Please, turn it off!

50:31.396 --> 50:34.263
Oh, my God! Marcus!

52:12.930 --> 52:15.698
- You're a little slut. Say it.
- I'm a slut.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.133
You're lying to me!

52:17.135 --> 52:18.834
- Say it again!
- I'm a slut!

52:18.836 --> 52:21.270
This ride is different
than I thought it was gonna be.

52:21.272 --> 52:23.806
<i>You're right.
I think I'd remember</i>

52:23.808 --> 52:25.674
if we came through here before.

52:25.676 --> 52:26.976
Your secretary, George?

52:26.978 --> 52:30.746
Really? She's half your age.

52:30.748 --> 52:32.781
Oh, it was only one time, sugar.

52:32.783 --> 52:34.150
It didn't mean anything.

52:34.152 --> 52:35.818
You're gonna be able
to walk soon, right?

52:35.820 --> 52:37.620
I'll have to
when the ride is over.

52:37.622 --> 52:38.621
Sarah!

52:38.623 --> 52:40.689
What was that?

52:40.691 --> 52:42.458
I-I don't like this.

52:45.796 --> 52:47.429
My gosh!

52:47.431 --> 52:50.566
<i>Maybe we should just...
Maybe we should just get off.</i>

52:50.568 --> 52:51.867
How's your leg doing, Gordy?

52:51.869 --> 52:54.136
It only hurts
when I have to move it.

52:54.138 --> 52:57.773
- Yeah, but I'll help you, okay?
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.842
We're just gonna have
to keep going while it's moving.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.644
Okay. Come on, Gordy.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.445
Pull out your leg.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.915
- Stand up, Gordy!
- Okay.

53:07.185 --> 53:10.019
<i>Okay, it's over there.
Let's find the exit.</i>

53:10.021 --> 53:11.520
That's really, really creepy.

53:14.292 --> 53:16.792
- I just want to find her.
- Yeah, I do, too.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.500
Jack-in-the-boxes
are everywhere.

53:25.903 --> 53:29.171
Jack-in-the-boxes
are everywhere.

53:30.975 --> 53:33.242
Everywhere is a Jack-in-the box.

53:35.213 --> 53:36.245
Wow.

53:36.247 --> 53:38.314
That's a really big
jack-in-the-box.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.584
It's Marcus!

53:41.586 --> 53:42.918
Oh, my God!

53:42.920 --> 53:45.321
I cannot believe this!

53:45.323 --> 53:46.722
Gordy, my baby sister!

53:46.724 --> 53:47.756
It'll be okay.

53:50.027 --> 53:51.493
Let's go.

53:51.495 --> 53:52.661
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

53:52.663 --> 53:54.129
Run! Run! Go!

53:54.131 --> 53:55.931
Gordy, I can't leave you!

53:55.933 --> 53:57.366
Run! Go get Sally!

53:57.368 --> 54:00.336
No! Get away from me now!

54:14.852 --> 54:16.252
Sarah.

54:17.255 --> 54:18.520
Sarah.

54:18.522 --> 54:19.522
Austin?

54:21.792 --> 54:24.793
Austin? Is Sally with you?

54:24.795 --> 54:26.862
No, no, no, no,
but I know where she is.

54:26.864 --> 54:27.997
Where?

54:27.999 --> 54:29.498
Is she okay? Is she hurt?

54:29.500 --> 54:32.001
She's not hurt,
as far as I can see. She...

54:32.003 --> 54:34.003
Sally, Jillian, Davy, they're...

54:34.005 --> 54:35.571
They're all
in the same place, okay,

54:35.573 --> 54:38.307
<i>this circus tent thing, okay?
The clown has them all.</i>

54:39.744 --> 54:43.212
Okay, well,
the clown killed Gordy.

54:43.214 --> 54:46.081
<i>Marcus is dead, too.
We just saw him.</i>

54:49.153 --> 54:50.753
<i>Okay. I'm gonna
go find a way out,</i>

54:50.755 --> 54:52.955
and I'm gonna come back
for you, okay?

54:52.957 --> 54:54.857
Okay. Okay.

54:54.859 --> 54:56.392
Okay.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.967
Austin!

55:05.803 --> 55:07.403
Oh, my God!

55:07.405 --> 55:09.038
Let me go!

55:09.040 --> 55:12.174
No! No!

55:20.785 --> 55:23.285
No! No! Get off!

55:36.300 --> 55:38.967
<i>Please don't.
Please don't. Please.</i>

55:44.275 --> 55:46.975
Get off me!

55:46.977 --> 55:49.144
No! Please, no.

55:49.947 --> 55:52.081
No, please.

55:52.083 --> 55:54.450
No. No.

56:03.327 --> 56:05.594
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

56:05.596 --> 56:06.995
It's gonna be okay.

56:06.997 --> 56:08.297
I'll get you out.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.234
Are you okay, Davy?

56:12.236 --> 56:13.602
You okay?

56:49.106 --> 56:52.374
Who doesn't love the carnival?

56:53.477 --> 56:55.911
And everybody knows
the best place to visit

56:55.913 --> 56:58.480
at a carnival is the Fun House.

56:59.784 --> 57:03.485
Look at all those good times
people are having there,

57:03.487 --> 57:06.054
making their way
through the Barrel of Laughs,

57:06.056 --> 57:07.523
the crazy floor gags,

57:07.525 --> 57:10.826
and all sorts of tricks
about the Fun House.

57:10.828 --> 57:12.694
And when that's all over with,

57:12.696 --> 57:16.198
don't forget to have
a refreshing hot dog and a drink

57:16.200 --> 57:19.134
from one
of our refreshment stands.

57:19.136 --> 57:21.170
The first fun houses

57:21.172 --> 57:25.441
began traveling around
the United States in 1886.

57:25.443 --> 57:28.010
They were called Happy Houses.

57:28.012 --> 57:29.012
Soon after that...

58:24.802 --> 58:28.537
You are very special boys.

58:30.207 --> 58:32.674
All of the power
that's in our family,

58:32.676 --> 58:37.079
all of the strength,
it's in you and you.

58:38.282 --> 58:43.619
Never, ever let anyone
take advantage of you, okay?

58:43.621 --> 58:44.720
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:44.722 --> 58:48.857
And with you,
the show will go on forever.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.292
Promise.

58:50.294 --> 58:53.095
Thoth, even after I'm gone.

58:53.097 --> 58:54.796
Promise me the show
will go on forever.

58:54.798 --> 58:56.598
Okay, I promise.

58:56.600 --> 58:59.568
<i>I love you boys so much.
Give Mom a hug.</i>

58:59.570 --> 59:01.770
Love you, too.

59:03.774 --> 59:06.008
Aw, that sounds like a fun plan.

59:07.745 --> 59:10.679
Oh, my perfect little clown.

59:11.682 --> 59:12.748
Thank you, Mom.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.349
You're very welcome.

59:14.351 --> 59:18.086
Oh, get that little hair
right there.

59:18.088 --> 59:20.856
Do you boys know that I'm
the luckiest girl in the world?

59:20.858 --> 59:22.257
Uh, yeah.

59:22.259 --> 59:23.926
I have the sweetest boys.

59:27.331 --> 59:30.365
Thoth, even after I'm gone,

59:30.367 --> 59:31.967
promise me the show
will go on forever.

59:31.969 --> 59:34.069
Okay, I promise.

59:34.071 --> 59:36.638
I love you boys so much.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.543
"Love"?

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.589
"Dead parents"?

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.310
Make sure to get
just the right amount of paint

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:23.578
- on the brush.
- Okay.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.881
<i>Not too much.
Just a little bit at a time</i>

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:29.718
until it looks like
the whole brush is covered,

01:02:01.452 --> 01:02:03.585
What the hell?

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.444
Welcome, welcome, welcome

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.180
to the Gaspari Family Circus,

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:35.450
the only circus in the world
where everyone performing

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:39.688
is part of the same family,
the Gasparis.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.833
No, no. No.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:52.868
And we want to thank

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.470
all the citizens
of Hidden Desert, Nevada,

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:58.807
for letting us
make this place our home.

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:01.643
Kody! Kody!

01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:02.944
Kody!

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:06.481
Kody!

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:11.553
Is everybody ready
for the greatest show on Earth?

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:15.791
Welcome, then,
the Gaspari Family Clowns

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:20.262
and their wonderful,
hilarious clown cars.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:58.600
And now turn your attention
to our very first act of daring.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.337
Who loves popcorn?

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.206
Everybody loves popcorn.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.975
It's America's favorite treat.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.580
With Galco, the Transformer,

01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:14.382
and his amazing popcorn trick.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.270
Wasn't that great, folks?

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:09.404
Kabam!

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.749
Now turn your attention
to Ring Number Two

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:23.718
for our next amazing act.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.622
For this, we'll need
a volunteer from the audience

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:30.525
to do the amazing, magnificent,

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:33.828
life-distressing fire trick.

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.730
- No, no, no!
- Stay away!

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.400
No! Get away!

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:43.605
No. No.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.189
Get away from me!

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.892
In the ancient world,

01:06:03.894 --> 01:06:07.395
Prometheus came down
from Mount Olympus

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:11.499
to give humankind
the gift of fire.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.735
Fire has transformed our lives,

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:16.204
has brought us from the caves.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:17.672
No!

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:19.708
Now we bring this piece
of history to you,

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:24.846
so turn your attention
to Ring Number Two

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:28.316
for the famous,
the fantabulous...

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.855
Promethean Triangle of Fire!

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.243
I don't want... Please.

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:00.215
No! No! Aah!

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:02.350
Watch the Promethean fire grow!

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.252
No!

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:07.355
Burn. Burn away the caveman,

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.290
the primitive from our lives,

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:11.192
and turn us into humans,

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:15.497
purifying our world
with the flame of the gods!

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.699
No!

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.240
Please make it stop.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.241
Make it stop!

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.675
Stop it.

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.833
<i>Purifying our world.
Purifying our world.</i>

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:54.135
Purifying our world.

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:56.538
Purifying our world.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:01.342
Purifying our world.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.247
- Stop, Dad!
- Dad, stop!

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:08.416
Stop! No!

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.719
I win!

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:14.656
No! Mom.

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:16.658
What are
you guys doing over here?

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.593
- There's, um...
- Did you find anything?

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.161
Yeah, we got a few good ones.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.201
Get Sally. Save Sally!

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.202
Save Sally! Go!

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.269
Save Sally!

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.234
Help, please.

01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:34.335
Please, please!

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.337
Sarah! Sarah!

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:37.505
Are you okay?

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.340
Help me unknot.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:44.212
- Oh, my gosh.
- Go. Go. Go. Go.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.113
I got you, okay?

01:09:45.115 --> 01:09:46.814
I got her! I got her! I got her!

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:49.017
- Get Jill! Get Jill!
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:51.019
<i>You're okay. You're okay.</i>

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.254
- I got you, okay?
- It's okay.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:55.023
- Come on. Go.
- You got her, right?

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.858
- Kody. Kody.
- Davy, leave him!

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.793
- Kody. Kody.
- Davy, leave him!

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.495
<i>Help me with him!
Help me bring him.</i>

01:10:00.497 --> 01:10:02.664
- Come on! Go! Go!
- You got her, right?

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:04.432
- You got my sister?
- Go. Go.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:06.634
<i>Help me with Kody!
We can't leave him here!</i>

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:07.735
He's dead! Come on!

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:11.940
Okay.

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:14.976
Let's go.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.345
They're so bad.

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:19.547
- Come on, Davy.
- They're...

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.318
Okay. Come on.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.854
Come on. Come on.

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.056
Austin, I need your help.

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:03.958
- Hurry.
- I got her. I got her.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.862
- Okay. Okay.
- Sarah, Sarah, my legs.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:09.864
Okay, so I know the way
out from the maze.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:13.034
Guys, we just have to get there,
okay? Any ideas?

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:15.536
<i>I can do it. I can do it.
I know where we are.</i>

01:11:15.538 --> 01:11:17.972
Wait. Where's Davy? Davy!

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:19.941
Davy! Davy!

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.442
- Sarah?
- Davy.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.910
<i>He's coming!
He's coming! He's coming!</i>

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:24.712
<i>I'm sorry!
I couldn't help myself!</i>

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.014
I'm not gonna leave Kody here!

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.015
Okay. Come on.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:29.050
I got him! Oh, my God.

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:30.551
You did the right thing, Davy.

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:32.487
I'm not gonna leave him
here in this hellhole!

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:33.655
I know. I know.

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:35.290
- We got to go.
- Thank you.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.427
Come on. Come on.

01:11:39.429 --> 01:11:41.062
Ow!

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:42.597
Guys, I-I need help with him!

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:43.765
I can't carry him anymore!

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.099
- We have to carry Jillian!
- I know!

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:47.435
- He's slowing us down!
- Leave me.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.037
No, absolutely not!

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.772
We're leaving Kody
if anything, okay?

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:51.839
Jillian is still alive!

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.041
We can't just leave him here!

01:11:53.043 --> 01:11:54.542
We're not leaving Kody!

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.778
Okay, we can put him
in the Tunnel of Love, okay?

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.912
- Okay.
- And he'll be safe there,

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:59.347
- I promise. And then...
- Okay.

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.648
- I can't...
- Sally, come on.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.883
Austin, you need to take...

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:03.518
Fine, but we're
coming back for him!

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.119
We're getting cops,
and we're coming back for him!

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.988
- Do you have him?
- Okay, Davy, we will.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.856
- Austin, I can't do it.
- Come on. Come on.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:11.559
I got you, Jill. I got you.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:12.560
Okay. Ready?

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:13.961
- You got it?
- I think so.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.763
<i>You got it. Okay, okay.
Let's just wait here.</i>

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:16.964
- No.
- Oh, no, no!

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.132
We'll be home soon.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:21.169
- I just want it to be over!
- Austin!

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:22.403
Hurry!

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:28.643
Then we go.

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:44.425
- Bye, Kody.
- Bye, Kody.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.699
We should take these.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.838
Welcome to the Tunnel of Love.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.439
Okay, okay.

01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:00.775
<i>Okay. Shh. Come on. Come on.
It's just up and to the left.</i>

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:02.910
<i>It's just to the left.
It's just to the left.</i>

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:03.912
My leg!

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.298
Get down. Get down.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.000
Get her down. Get her down.

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:28.136
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. I know. I know.</i>

01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:29.170
I know it hurts.

01:13:30.974 --> 01:13:33.374
- Shh.
- I know it hurts.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.076
<i>Just breathe. Breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe,</i>

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:37.211
You guys know the way out?

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:39.447
You guys,
you guys, just be quiet.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:44.852
<i>You're in a lot of pain.
Hold still.</i>

01:13:46.322 --> 01:13:48.089
Awooo!

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.424
I hear something.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:51.692
All right, you can do it.

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:52.860
You can do it. You can do it.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:54.462
- Go. Go.
- You have to! You have to!

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:57.799
Whooooo!

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:59.400
It hurts!

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:01.269
- No, I know. I know.
- It hurts!

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:02.970
Watch out. Watch out.

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:04.205
This is so scary.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:07.975
Lean on me. Lean on me.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.844
- Jill, come on!
- My legs are...

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:11.546
- I know.
- Come on.

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:12.647
I'm sorry, Sally.

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:14.415
- Yeah?
- Come on.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:15.616
- This way.
- I'm falling.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.684
Come on, Jill. Come on.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.686
- Sarah, stay up!
- She's really heavy!

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:19.954
Shh. Okay.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:21.289
Okay, can we wait for a second?

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:22.790
- Come on. Tighter.
- Can we breathe?

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.258
Here. Here. You can sit.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.994
- Get down.
- You will die soon.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:29.130
Everybody dies.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:31.466
Everybody dies.

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:33.835
- Davy, careful.
- Everybody dies.

01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:38.139
- Die in pain.
- Do you see anything?

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.975
- Do you see anything?
- Die in pain.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:42.376
You will die in pain.

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:45.613
You will die in pain.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:49.584
You are about to die.

01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:51.886
You will die soon.

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:53.654
- Ooooh. Ooh-hoo.
- Sally, this way.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.591
- Okay. When can we go?
- You will die.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:15:00.061
- You will die.
- Come here. Get set. Get set.

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.597
- Ohhhhh!
- He's behind the wall.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.901
Oooooh!

01:15:06.903 --> 01:15:08.169
<i>Cover your eyes.
Cover your eyes.</i>

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:10.037
Whoooo!

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:12.206
<i>Go, go, go, go!
Baby, go, go, go!</i>

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:17.678
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.981
Go!

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:21.849
Sarah, my legs!

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.984
- Come on!
- Come on.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.455
- Go!
- Stop!

01:15:27.457 --> 01:15:29.223
Sally!

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:31.826
- Sally!
- Sally!

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:33.094
He's behind us!

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:35.630
It's a dead end!

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:38.666
Davy, do not leave her
on her own!

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:39.734
Come on!

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.540
Get out! Go back!

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:48.843
Get out! Go back! Sarah!

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:51.579
Davy!

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:53.514
Go, go, go, go!

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:57.985
Oh, my God. It's closing.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.353
Everybody, just go! Just run!

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:00.955
<i>We'll be there in a second!
Come on, Jill!</i>

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:02.223
- It's closing!
- I'm stuck!

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:03.391
<i>No, you're not!
You're not stuck!</i>

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:04.825
- No, you're not!
- Go! Just go!

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:07.461
Aah! It's crushing me!

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:09.964
Jill, come on!

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:11.933
Come on!

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:16.270
- Everyone, pull!
- Come on! Help! Get her out!

01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:18.139
Come on!

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:19.774
No, it's okay! Come on.

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:23.077
<i>You got to pick her up.
Pick her up. Pick her up.</i>

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:36.524
Th-This is
the same room we came through

01:16:36.526 --> 01:16:38.092
- when the lights shut off.
- Hold on, okay?

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.760
<i>Hold on. Hold on. Okay.
I have the map.</i>

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.063
I-I just need a second
to figure it out.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:43.164
Just wait.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.899
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:46.801
Okay. Okay.

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:47.969
Come on, Jill.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:50.404
Jill? Jill?

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:52.506
- Wait. Okay, wait.
- Jill!

01:16:53.543 --> 01:16:54.976
No!

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:57.244
Jill.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:59.046
- Jill. Jill.
- Jill.

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:00.414
Ohh. Ohh.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:03.017
- Jill. Jill.
- Shh. He's coming.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:04.885
Jill. Jill.

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:14.829
- Go! Let's move!
- We can't leave her!

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:16.797
<i>Go. Come on, Sarah. Come on.
Sarah, no, no, no.</i>

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:21.002
- We can't.
- Come on. Come on.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:22.069
Let's go.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.704
That's it. This way.

01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:25.539
<i>It's right here.
Right here. Come on.</i>

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:28.542
Take the others with you
to the front door, okay? Okay?

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:30.111
- Here's the chart.
- Okay.

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:32.580
The exit's that way. Go.

01:17:32.582 --> 01:17:35.249
- I'm gonna go find him, okay?
- Right.

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:36.884
Okay, I'm gonna
go up to the attic,

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:38.853
<i>and I'll distract the clown.
You guys go!</i>

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:40.087
I'm staying with you.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:41.689
- Go.
- Come on.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.424
- I'm gonna be staying with...
- I'm gonna lead the clown

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:45.292
to the attic so you guys
have time to get out, okay?

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:46.293
- I'm staying with you.
- No.

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:47.395
No, you're not, Davy.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:48.663
- You have to go, man.
- No.

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:50.398
No, Davy, go!

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.233
I'm not gonna let you
face that thing alone!

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:54.135
Come on. Davy, now!

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:56.437
- Go, Davy!
- I'm staying!

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.306
I'm staying here!

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:07.682
Don't worry, baby, okay?

01:18:07.684 --> 01:18:09.350
<i>J-Just get out of here.
We're right behind you,</i>

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:10.384
- I promise. Just go!
- No.

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:12.253
Go, go, go, go, go! Go. Go.

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:18.894
Damn it, Davy.

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:42.349
<i>I got a bag over here.
It's got weapons in it.</i>

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:43.651
Good! Let's fuck this psycho up!

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:46.420
Yo, clown boy! Come and get it!

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:48.189
We're right here, asshole!

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:50.057
Okay.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:51.926
- Here. This.
- Okay. Okay.

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:53.194
This'll do some damage.

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:54.662
Here you go. Okay.

01:18:56.466 --> 01:18:58.966
Okay. On my notice.

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:05.039
Do you think
this is enough to kill him?

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:08.876
No, no, but, when he pops out,
make for the vents, okay?

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:10.578
Okay. Okay.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:22.356
Do you think
he went after the others?

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:23.591
No, he's definitely here.

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:27.294
Agh!

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.996
Hit him, Davy!

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:34.368
Get going.

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:38.606
Davy!

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:17.244
Austin?!

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:20.447
Austin, say something!

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:51.078
Davy!

01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:53.681
Austin!

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:54.683
Davy!

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:57.852
Austin!

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:02.022
Aus... tin.

01:21:03.893 --> 01:21:04.692
Davy?

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:07.161
I can't see anything.

01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:11.065
- Agh!
- Davy.

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:19.874
- Davy!
- I'm sorry.

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:22.343
It's okay. I'm sorry, man.

01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:23.611
I'm sorry!

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:26.680
Thank you, Austin.

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:30.050
Thank you for being my brother.

01:21:31.687 --> 01:21:32.987
Davy!

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:42.029
I'm gonna finish this, bro.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.731
I'm gonna finish this.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.129
Thoth.

01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:17.164
Thoth!

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:18.666
You motherfuckin' clown!

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:20.567
Come give Mommy a hug!

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.536
Come and get me, clown boy!

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:31.045
All of the power
that's in our family,

01:22:31.047 --> 01:22:34.848
all of the strength
is in you and you.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.653
Promise me, even after I'm gone,

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.755
the show will always go on.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.291
I promise.

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:52.566
Let's see how you like it,
Mama's boy.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:06.347
Wait, wait, wait.

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:07.848
Are they coming?

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:11.352
Did they make it out? Austin!

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.490
Oh, my God.
