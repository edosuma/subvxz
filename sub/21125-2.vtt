WEBVTT

00:06.474 --> 00:08.509
- Wow, she's really
Jackson Pollocking

00:09.077 --> 00:09.643
with that yogurt, huh?

00:10.544 --> 00:11.245
- Oh, yes,
Charlotte's very creative.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.381
We've always known that.
- Yeah.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.250
But do you think we should be
teaching her how to use a spoon?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.152
- You know who else
played with their food?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.521
Barack Hussein Obama.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.124
- Oh, my God, it's Bird Bones.
Hide me.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.359
- Ooh, body be banging
even in a red suit.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.128
- Maggie, Maggie,
this is serious, okay?

00:27.228 --> 00:28.529
We gotta get out of here,
so take the baby,

00:28.629 --> 00:29.797
leave the yogurt.
- Let's go.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.399
- Why?
What did you do?

00:31.499 --> 00:33.101
I didn't do anything.
I just--I haven't

00:33.201 --> 00:34.435
seen her since Mark and I
got together.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.337
- But you told her, right?
Called her or something?

00:36.437 --> 00:38.739
- Mark told her, and I drafted
a few texts that were like,

00:38.839 --> 00:40.241
"Hey, we good?"

00:40.341 --> 00:42.276
- You drafted texts that said,
"We good?"

00:42.376 --> 00:44.812
Emma, it's been a month.
- I know, and if she sees me,

00:44.912 --> 00:46.714
then she's gonna think
I've been avoiding her,

00:46.814 --> 00:48.282
so can we please just go?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.184
- It's gonna be tough stuff
for you, huh?

00:50.284 --> 00:51.385
- Maggie, don't teach me
a life lesson.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.754
- Oh, Tina!
Hey, girl.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.724
- Hey, Maggie.
Hey, Emma.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.293
Hi, Charlotte.
You all look great.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.761
Well, you look great,
and look great,

01:00.861 --> 01:02.263
and, Charlotte, you look great.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.565
We are all doing great.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.300
- Um.
- Do you want to

01:06.400 --> 01:08.336
tell her something?
She wanted to talk to you.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.571
Go ahead.
- Um, hey, Tina,

01:10.671 --> 01:13.674
I meant to reach out--
- Oh, about you and Mark?

01:13.774 --> 01:16.244
Please, I am happy for you both.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.845
One man's trash is
another man's treasure.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.248
I mean, not that Mark was trash,
but, you know, our marriage

01:20.348 --> 01:22.850
was for so long.
- Hey, Tina, what's up with

01:22.950 --> 01:25.286
the red suit?
- Oh, uh, it's a--

01:25.386 --> 01:28.589
it's a business suit
'cause I'm in business now,

01:28.689 --> 01:32.293
so, taking care of business.
- What kind of business?

01:32.393 --> 01:35.663
- None of your business!
[laughing]

01:35.763 --> 01:37.231
Bye.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.337
- I feel like we were
just assaulted.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.373
- That was weird
even for Bird Bones.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.641
I wonder if she's okay.
- Yeah, I guess

01:47.741 --> 01:49.610
we'll just never know.
- Stop by her house.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.145
- What?
Why would we do

01:52.280 --> 01:53.214
something like that?
- Oh, we're not doing anything.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.648
You are.
- Why?

01:54.748 --> 01:55.883
- Because you owe it to her

01:55.983 --> 01:58.552
after not sending
all those drafted texts.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.289
- Okay, I'm gonna go, but I'm
taking Char-Bar with me.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.756
- You're not using my child
as a human shield.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.625
- Please?
- That's where I draw the line

02:04.725 --> 02:06.394
on this friendship.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.296
[Say Hi's "Back before
We Were Brittle" playing]

02:08.396 --> 02:11.165
- * Hey, remember when

02:11.265 --> 02:13.901
* All of time stood still

02:14.001 --> 02:18.439
* Ooh, do do do do

02:18.539 --> 02:22.142
* Back before we were brittle

02:22.243 --> 02:25.279
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:26.314 --> 02:27.748
- God, I'm freaking out.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.717
Look at my armpits--
They're like swimming pools.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.185
- Aw, Jeff, we got this, okay?

02:31.285 --> 02:32.586
We've nailed
every other rotation.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.754
How bad can one guy be?

02:33.854 --> 02:36.290
- Dr. Ericson?
Really bad.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.791
- No.
- One false move, and he

02:37.891 --> 02:40.628
gives you a bad recommendation,
and then it's urology

02:40.728 --> 02:43.764
for the rest of your life.
- Okay, he's just a human man

02:43.864 --> 02:45.499
who also happens to be a doctor.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.636
- You know they call him
Dr. Freeze 'cause he's so cold?

02:48.736 --> 02:50.304
- Well, that's not
a good nickname.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.406
It should be something
like Ice Ice Baby or--

02:52.506 --> 02:55.175
- Snow Pesci.
- Yeah, or Snowpra.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.577
Snowpra's favorite thing.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.646
- You get a bad recommendation,
and you get

02:58.746 --> 03:01.482
a bad recommendation, and you
get a bad recommendation!

03:01.582 --> 03:02.650
Ah!

03:02.750 --> 03:04.752
- Are you two with me today?
- Uh-oh.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.186
- Keep your heads down.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.588
If you have any questions,
do not ask them

03:07.688 --> 03:11.825
in front of the patients.
The patients come first.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.261
- That's what she said.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.428
[both giggling]

03:14.528 --> 03:15.963
- Sorry, did you say something?

03:16.063 --> 03:17.798
- No, sir, I did not.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.434
- 'Cause I thought I heard
you say, "That's what she said."

03:20.534 --> 03:21.835
Who were you talking about?
Did you say something?

03:21.935 --> 03:24.305
- I didn't.
It's just--I think he was

03:24.405 --> 03:25.973
making the old American joke.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.208
You know,
"That's what she said."

03:28.309 --> 03:30.210
- [whispering]
That's what she said.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.347
- Right, so no one
actually said anything?

03:33.447 --> 03:34.615
- Uh, that's right.

03:37.585 --> 03:41.389
- We have a lot of work to do.
Keep up.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.991
- Oh, God.
- I'm so cold.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.327
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.695
[upbeat music]

03:47.795 --> 03:48.662
- Jeff.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.867
- Hi, Teens.
- Oh!

03:53.967 --> 03:55.603
Oh, hey, Emma.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.272
- Tina, I feel really horrible
that I haven't called.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.573
I just wanted to make sure
there's not

03:59.673 --> 04:02.776
any weirdness about--
- No, no, I'm--

04:02.876 --> 04:04.912
I'm happy for you both.
- Really?

04:05.012 --> 04:08.382
- Really.
- Oh, good, that's a relief.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.851
- Okay.
- Um, Tina, this is

04:10.951 --> 04:13.687
a lot of boxes here, huh?
- Yeah, well, thank goodness

04:13.787 --> 04:16.357
for the RAV4, and
its spacious cargo capacity,

04:16.457 --> 04:18.359
not to mention
the fold-flat second row.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.561
- Yeah, the RAV4 is
a phenomenal vehicle.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.364
Um, what's in these boxes, Tina?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.933
Are you QVCing again?
- No.

04:26.033 --> 04:30.504
These are for--my new business.
- Tina, you can't keep

04:30.604 --> 04:32.806
just saying "business."

04:32.906 --> 04:34.508
What's going on?

04:34.608 --> 04:38.612
- Look, now that I'm single,
I want to have a career.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.047
You know, like you used to have.

04:40.147 --> 04:44.652
- Oh, okay, well, I did
just plan a "Hamilton" themed

04:44.752 --> 04:46.754
bar mitzvah, which was
very well received.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.857
* 1776
- Well, anyway, and then,

04:49.957 --> 04:52.760
a few weeks ago, this woman
came up to me, and she said,

04:52.860 --> 04:55.929
"Have you ever considered
selling Illuminage cosmetics?"

04:56.029 --> 04:58.666
- And she pressured you
into buying all this inventory?

04:58.766 --> 05:01.635
- She called it
the "Quantum Package."

05:01.735 --> 05:03.437
- Tina, this is
a pyramid scheme.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.572
- Like cheerleading?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.540
- No, not at all
like cheerleading.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.743
All right, um, how much of this
have you already sold?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.380
- Zero.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.715
Zero Quantum Package.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.883
[beep]

05:15.983 --> 05:19.520
- Okay, I don't want you to
worry because you've got

05:19.620 --> 05:20.688
Shark Tank over here, all right?

05:20.788 --> 05:24.558
There is nothing, and I mean
nothing, that I cannot sell.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.894
Now, are these boxes all that
we have to get rid of?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.897
- Um, well, there's this.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.865
And this.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.435
- Oh, Teens.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.437
This is too many boxes.

05:37.771 --> 05:41.375
- Okay, Jeff, tell me about
Mr. Linley's vitals.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.676
- His vitals are good.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.878
His heart rate is slightly
elevated at 110.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.848
- And should I be worried
about the elevation?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.049
- Yes.
- No.

05:50.050 --> 05:50.818
Maggie, why?
- Because it's probably just

05:51.685 --> 05:52.520
post-op pain combined with
the exertion

05:53.454 --> 05:54.688
of his walk around the floor.
- Correct.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.089
Good, thank you.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.725
Okay, let's see.
[beeping]

05:57.825 --> 06:00.027
Jeff, can you make
that noise go away, please?

06:00.127 --> 06:01.395
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.596
Sorry, Mr. Linley,
where were we?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.098
So yes, you--
you passed the stone.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.468
There's no infection.
That's good news.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.802
[beeping]

06:08.902 --> 06:10.838
[no audible speech]

06:10.938 --> 06:12.506
[beeping]

06:12.606 --> 06:14.742
Jeff, I really need
that beeping to stop.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.977
- I'm working on it, Doctor.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.946
- Now, unfortunately,
the ultrasound did pick up

06:19.046 --> 06:21.381
other gallstones,
and that's why we've had to

06:21.482 --> 06:22.650
remove your gallbladder.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.785
That's all pretty
straightforward.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.753
[shrill beeping]

06:25.853 --> 06:28.456
Jeff, is there a problem here?

06:28.556 --> 06:29.690
- It won't stop beeping.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.391
- [coughs]
It's the battery.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.893
- What?
- I think it's the battery.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.662
- Maggie, if you're gonna
tell him how to something,

06:34.762 --> 06:36.129
why don't you just go and do it?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.998
- Yeah, right away.
[shrill beeping]

06:38.098 --> 06:39.900
- Yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.671
Sorry, Mr. Linley, I seem to be
working with amateurs.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.906
- Wh--Why do we have to this?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.041
Can't we just move to
a new state?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.110
Start a new life?
- Teens, you need to relax.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.579
You want to be
a business woman, right?

06:51.679 --> 06:52.813
- I do, desperately.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.782
- Then this is
your first lesson.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.784
It's called "negotiation,"
and it's one of the classic

06:56.884 --> 06:58.452
tenets of business.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.621
- Emma, I don't think you know
what you're dealing with.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.156
Vanessa is fearless.
- Please, you think I'm afraid

07:03.256 --> 07:05.793
of some basic B from Danbury?
[gasps]

07:05.893 --> 07:10.163
Wow, hotel spaghetti
in a white blazer?

07:10.263 --> 07:13.501
This woman is fearless.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.003
All right.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.009
- That's funny.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.544
- Um, Vanessa?

07:23.644 --> 07:27.981
- Okay, Tina, to what do I
owe this pleasure?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.551
Have you already sold
your Quantum Package?

07:30.651 --> 07:31.819
- Um, well, not exactly--

07:31.919 --> 07:33.721
- Great, then
this meeting's over.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.689
- If I could just jump in here--
- I'm sorry, who is this person

07:35.789 --> 07:37.224
that's talking to me right now?

07:37.324 --> 07:39.092
- Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm her associate,

07:39.192 --> 07:40.594
Emma Crawford.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.763
That's a beautiful blazer,
by the way.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.997
Is that--
- Dolce & Gabbana.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.100
- Gabbana, yes, know it,
love it, worn it.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.838
Truthfully, Vanessa,
businesswoman to businesswoman,

07:50.938 --> 07:55.643
my friend Tina here is in over
her head, and, unfortunately,

07:55.743 --> 07:57.678
she's not gonna be able to sell
the Quantum Package

07:57.778 --> 07:59.112
as previously discussed.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.515
- Well, I wish I could help,
but I just don't see

08:01.615 --> 08:03.551
how any of this is my problem.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.986
- Oh, okay, well, it is
your problem because

08:06.086 --> 08:08.088
you took advantage
of my friend here,

08:08.188 --> 08:10.691
a woman who has literally
no street smarts

08:10.791 --> 08:13.226
and is completely naive
to the world of business.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.928
- That is true--I am.
- Yeah.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.965
- Tina, Tina, Tina.

08:18.065 --> 08:22.836
Wow, I had really high hopes
for you, and now you come in

08:22.936 --> 08:26.506
with this woman, oh,
could clearly use

08:26.607 --> 08:28.508
our bronzer, and you
try to bail?

08:28.609 --> 08:31.645
- Wow, you wanna roll with this?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.747
Then let me tell you
how this is gonna go--

08:33.847 --> 08:35.749
- No, let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.017
- No, I'm not interested.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.118
- I'm not interested.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.554
- You know who's not interested?
Me.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.690
- I'm also not interested.
- Damn it.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.057
- So let me break this down
for you.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.159
I'm leaving for Hartford
for two days, then I go

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
to Bridgeport for three.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.765
When I'm back on Tuesday,
bitch better have my money

08:51.865 --> 08:56.003
because that's
how business works.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.606
- Oh...
[laughs] let me assure you,

08:58.706 --> 09:00.641
I know how business works.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.810
I used to move
a bajillion-dollar casino

09:02.910 --> 09:04.645
every minute in Macao.
- [laughs]

09:04.745 --> 09:06.213
- A bajillion.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.882
- Well, if that's true, why
can't you move a little makeup?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.819
- Oh, I promise you,
I could move your dumb makeup.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.186
- Well, then why don't you?
- Why don't I?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.055
- I'm gonna put you down
for a Quantum Package.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.857
- Emma, I don't think that--
- Don't worry, Tina.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.592
I know exactly what she's up to.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.333
- All right, Tina-reens, we got
a lot of face paint to unload,

09:27.434 --> 09:29.603
but the most important thing
is that we turn you into

09:29.703 --> 09:32.239
the business maven that we know
you can be, all right?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
So show me what you're thinking.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.978
- Okay, well, I made
a color-coded map of Pinebrook

09:38.078 --> 09:40.848
where I divided everyone
into age, income,

09:40.948 --> 09:42.916
and current shopping behavior.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.053
- Wow, Tina, this is actually
really good.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.255
Oh, my God, is that a Caboodles?

09:48.355 --> 09:52.693
- Mm-hmm, and I tricked it out
so that we can take it

09:52.793 --> 09:54.327
door-to-door.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.964
- Tina, this is really,
really good!

09:57.064 --> 09:58.198
I love this idea.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.000
Take it to the streets!
- [laughs]

10:00.100 --> 10:02.269
[doorbell dings]
Oh, our first customer!

10:02.369 --> 10:04.371
- Wait, I thought we were
gonna go door-to-door?

10:04.471 --> 10:07.741
- Yeah, they're going from
their door to my door.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.310
- Make me look like Vanna White.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.313
[upbeat music]

10:13.413 --> 10:17.150
*

10:17.250 --> 10:21.154
- Here--
Okay, in order to discharge you,

10:21.254 --> 10:23.256
we need to make sure
you're eating, okay?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.258
- It's Doctor's orders.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.362
- Okay, how about
this banana pudding, huh?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.699
I mean, it's not a Nilla wafer
situation, but it's

10:31.799 --> 10:32.766
pretty good, right, Jeff?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.034
- Oh, God, I'm not eating that.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.168
- Come on, just take a bite
for Mrs. Chang.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.837
Show her how delicious it is.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.271
- Maggie, it's swimsuit season.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.306
- Come on, Jeff.
- No.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.774
- Jeff...
- No, no, no.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.775
- Jeff!
- Uh-uh.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.143
- Jeff, eat it!
- No!

10:43.243 --> 10:45.378
- Put it in your mouth!
- What is this, Studio 54?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.714
- Ah.
- Oh!

10:47.647 --> 10:48.248
- Got you.
- Oh, come on, you haven't

10:49.282 --> 10:49.783
tried the pudding.
- Hey, no, oh, no, don't!

10:50.751 --> 10:51.651
You got it all over--
- Um, when you've

10:52.485 --> 10:53.320
quite finished
your pudding party,

10:54.187 --> 10:56.056
room 212 needs
his dressing changed.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.791
- Oh, we were just, uh, trying--

10:57.891 --> 11:02.062
- I know what you were doing.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.330
- [sighs]

11:03.430 --> 11:07.300
*

11:07.400 --> 11:09.369
- Tina, it's been an hour
and a half, so...

11:09.469 --> 11:11.238
- Oh, okay, I'm almost done.
- Okay.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.776
- Just one more
swipe of powder,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.946
and ta-da!

11:19.046 --> 11:22.950
- [gasps]
Hubba, hubba.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.418
I'd like to buy this vowel.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.720
[laughter]

11:27.620 --> 11:29.022
- Okay, now we will
take this all off,

11:29.122 --> 11:30.824
and we will start
your daytime look.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.394
- Uh, okay, Tina, Tina, sorry,
we have thousands of dollars

11:34.494 --> 11:37.064
of makeup to sell, so I think
we need to move this along.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.432
- Oh.
- Hey, Mary-Pat, what are we

11:39.532 --> 11:41.268
thinking, purchase-wise?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.971
- Guess I gotta
buy something, huh?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.773
That's how they getcha.
- Yeah.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.140
[laughter]

11:47.240 --> 11:49.476
- I'll take one chapstick.
- Chapstick?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.979
- Yes, my first sale!
- One!

11:52.079 --> 11:54.281
- Great, I will
wrap this up for you.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.315
Boop!

11:55.415 --> 11:59.920
*

12:00.020 --> 12:01.121
- Hey.
- Hey, why did I have to

12:01.221 --> 12:02.722
park three blocks down the road?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.291
- 'Cause I got a bunch of women
in the living room

12:04.391 --> 12:06.326
for a makeup party,
and all that's missing

12:06.426 --> 12:08.762
is your baby-soft skin.
- Oh, no, no, no, no way.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.764
I'm exhausted, I'm covered
in banana pudding--

12:10.864 --> 12:13.333
- Please, Maggie, I got
so much product to move,

12:13.433 --> 12:14.968
and Bird Bones is killing me.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.403
*

12:16.503 --> 12:20.774
Okay, ladies, today is
your lucky day because we have

12:20.874 --> 12:25.345
a special demo with Illuminage's
premiere sales consultant.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.949
You know her from the gym, and
from various Pinterest pages,

12:29.049 --> 12:31.051
please welcome Tina.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.286
- Thank you, thank you.
- Okay, get up here.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.955
- Thank you, Emma.
[clears throat]

12:35.055 --> 12:37.490
Okay, well, um,

12:37.590 --> 12:42.762
the first thing that I like
to do is examine my canvas.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.799
Maggie here, of course,
has flawless skin.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.968
- Aw, thanks, Teens.
- And, frankly, I don't think

12:48.068 --> 12:50.403
that she needs
any makeup at all.

12:50.503 --> 12:54.207
But if I had to put something
on her,

12:54.307 --> 12:56.910
I--I would use some blush.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.046
Okay, so, we do that, that.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.313
There you go.

13:00.413 --> 13:04.852
And that fresh face
is gonna cost you $9.50.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.187
- Oh, Tina, Tina, if I could
just jump in here.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.089
Let's get real, ladies.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.158
Maggie over here needs
a lot more help that that.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.559
Am I right?
- What's happening?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.062
- This is a woman who's
up with a baby all night.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.864
- Mm-hmm.
- She's at the hospital,

13:16.964 --> 13:19.166
bringing home the bacon all day.
- Single mom.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.801
- She's tired, you know?
Bedraggled, even.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.337
- Okay, all right.
- Time has worn its way

13:24.437 --> 13:28.108
down this face like water
once carved the crevices

13:28.208 --> 13:29.877
of the Grand Canyon, okay?

13:29.977 --> 13:32.279
Here, here, and also here.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.081
- We're comparing
my face to erosion?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.582
- But Illuminage
is here to help.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.985
Tina, be a doll, would you,
and load me up with

13:38.085 --> 13:40.387
some of Illuminage's
priming foundation.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.822
Well, you need to start
with the moisturizer fir--

13:42.923 --> 13:46.159
- Not now, all right,
and we're blending.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.028
- Good Lord.
- We're blending.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.364
- Okay, that's very aggressive.
- We're shading, we're shading,

13:51.464 --> 13:53.934
and we're contouring.
We're contouring.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.970
- It doesn't feel like it.
- Okay, and we finish it all off

13:57.070 --> 14:00.140
with a heavy swipe of
our patented bee sting

14:00.240 --> 14:02.842
lip-plumping lip gloss.
Oh, yeah.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.978
- Okay.
- And, voila.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.513
- Emma, what's in this?
It's really tingling.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.982
- Oh, the tingle means
it's working.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.450
[applause]

14:11.718 --> 14:13.353
Now join me in the corner where
Tina will be taking your orders.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.456
Tina?
I'm sorry, Tina?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.125
Just give me one second, okay?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.127
Keep it alive out here, okay?
- What's happening?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.895
- I don't know.
Sell something.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.532
Tina, what's going on?
I need you out there.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.867
Everyone wants to order.
- Ah, you don't need me.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.970
I'm just gonna go.
- What are you talking about?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.872
We're a huge hit.
- Well, you're a huge hit.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.442
I'm not doing anything.
- Oh, I just took over the demo

14:35.542 --> 14:37.010
'cause we weren't
moving enough product.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.879
- And why is that?
Because I'm terrible.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.281
- No.
- I don't know why I ever

14:41.381 --> 14:42.882
thought that--
that I could do this.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.885
I mean, I am terrible
at everything.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.088
- No.
- Yes, I screwed up my marriage.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.258
I screwed up this job.
I can't do anything right!

14:51.358 --> 14:52.592
[screams]

14:52.692 --> 14:54.294
- Well, if you're trying
to make a point, Teens,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.063
at least throw
something breakable.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.297
- [screams]

14:57.397 --> 14:58.665
*

14:58.765 --> 15:00.300
See?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.569
I can't even do that right.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.636
- No, Tina--

15:07.174 --> 15:09.376
- Oh, I am mad at you, Maggie.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.981
I binge-ate pudding all night
long, and then Charles finds me

15:14.081 --> 15:16.349
passed out like
a bloated raccoon in a nest

15:16.449 --> 15:17.917
of Little Debbie wrappers.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.953
Ah!
- It's really bad, right?

15:20.053 --> 15:22.956
- I'm so sorry, but
what happened to your face?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.524
Why do you look like
Lisa Rinna melted?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.393
- It's bee sting
lip-plumping lip gloss.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.095
- But you're allergic to bees.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.964
- I know, I tried to stop Emma,
but she just covered my face

15:31.064 --> 15:32.099
in the dumb stuff.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.400
Oh, God, what am I gonna do?

15:33.500 --> 15:34.701
I can't leave--
I told Ericson I'd do

15:34.801 --> 15:36.369
a double shipt.
- Huh?

15:36.469 --> 15:37.637
- A double chipt.
- What?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.472
- Two shifts.
- Oh, a double shift.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.673
- That's what I said.
- Uh-uh.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.375
- I need your help and support.

15:42.475 --> 15:47.014
- All right, I know exactly
what we're going to do.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.116
- Okay, so her blood
pressure's up.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.384
What's her weight?
- 104.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.021
- Can I see her labs, please?

15:55.655 --> 15:56.956
Can I see the labs?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.994
Just pass--pass the clipboard,
please, Maggie.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.263
- I'd rather not.
- Just give me the clipboard.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.065
- Yeah.

16:05.165 --> 16:09.436
- Just--give me the--
give me the clipboard.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.570
- Here you go.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.473
- Is this another one
of your jokes?

16:13.573 --> 16:14.674
- No, sir.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.509
- Then why are you
wearing a mask?

16:20.447 --> 16:23.683
Okay.
- [laughs]

16:23.783 --> 16:26.019
You look like Lisa Rinna.
- Oh, God.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.720
- Maggie, my office,
now, please.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.156
Right now.
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.224
Mrs. Chang.
- [muffled laughter]

16:31.324 --> 16:33.393
[upbeat music]

16:33.493 --> 16:34.694
- Tina.
- Oh!

16:34.794 --> 16:36.263
- I don't know why
I keep doing that.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.997
It's very creepy.
- What are you doing here?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.766
- You don't have to go in there.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.568
I'm gonna tell Vanessa that
we didn't sell the product.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.303
It was my fault.
I doubled down.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.138
- No, I am the one
who got us into this mess

16:45.238 --> 16:47.040
in the first place.
- Yeah, but I was supposed to

16:47.140 --> 16:49.642
be helping you, and, instead,
I just made you feel like

16:49.742 --> 16:51.144
you weren't good at anything.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.714
- Which is true.
- No, it's not.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.185
Listen to me, Tina, to me,
you'll always be

16:58.285 --> 17:00.720
that cheerleader on top
of the pyramid whose body

17:00.820 --> 17:04.457
be banging and, P.S.,
a mind to match, okay?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.159
So you're not good at
selling makeup.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.595
Who cares?
That just means something bigger

17:08.695 --> 17:10.663
is coming your way.

17:10.763 --> 17:14.634
- Thank you, Emma.
- Get in here.

17:14.734 --> 17:19.306
All right, let's go get
annihilated by this basic B.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.409
- I'm scared.
- I'm scared too.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.144
both: [sigh]

17:24.244 --> 17:25.712
*

17:25.812 --> 17:29.282
- Okay, that's
a shot of Benadryl.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.551
That should take the swelling
down a little bit.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.685
- Good.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.757
Dr. Ericson, I am very sorry.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.560
I--I don't usually act this way.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.095
- I don't believe that
for one second.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.830
- No, I mean, we like to
have fun at the workplace,

17:43.930 --> 17:46.099
sure, but--
- That isn't what I'm saying.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.635
Look, from my point of view,
you seem like an incredibly

17:48.735 --> 17:51.538
talented nurse with
a terrific bedside manner.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.672
Are you not normally like that?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.375
- Oh, um, thank you.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.678
It's been a pleasure shadowing
you this week as well.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.414
- No, it hasn't.
- Well, it ha--what?

18:01.514 --> 18:04.784
- So come on, what are they
calling me these days, hmm?

18:04.884 --> 18:06.819
- Oh, I never partook
in any of that.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.423
- Mm, Dr. Bobsled?
- That's a good one.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.225
- Cool Runnings?

18:12.325 --> 18:15.695
- No, uh, Dr. Popsicle is what
we had landed on recently.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.564
Mrs. Chang came up with
that one.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.166
- Mm, okay, that's
actually quite good.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.134
- Yeah.
- Is it because I'm so cold?

18:21.234 --> 18:22.869
- It's 'cause you have
a stick up your ass.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.471
[laughter]

18:25.672 --> 18:27.374
- Okay, so, look, I hope it
doesn't keep you from wanting

18:27.474 --> 18:30.277
to work with me because
I've requested that you

18:30.377 --> 18:32.179
continue on my rotation.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.213
- Really?

18:34.046 --> 18:35.748
- Jeff too, but for
different reasons.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.417
I like to watch him squirm.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.386
- Sure.
- Yeah.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.887
*

18:40.987 --> 18:47.126
- Yeah, yeah, so what I'm
hearing is that you failed.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.529
- I wouldn't exactly use
those words.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.299
I mean, we did sell
Tina's original package, and,

18:52.399 --> 18:54.234
if I hadn't doubled down--
- I'm gonna need to

18:54.334 --> 18:55.502
hear you say it.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.270
I'll sound it out for you--
it goes like this.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.607
I fa-ai-l-ed.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.442
- That is enough.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.810
Tina talks now.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.879
Look, I may not know
a lot about business,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.782
but one thing
I do know about is pyramids.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.352
Well, specifically,
cheerleading pyramids.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.521
And it is glorious at the top

19:14.621 --> 19:16.489
with the sun in your hair

19:16.589 --> 19:19.326
and the--
the wind up your skorts.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.860
- Where are we going
with this, Teens?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.830
- And--but what you don't
realize is that the people

19:23.930 --> 19:27.834
at the bottom actually have
the most power.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.837
So when Carlotta Frasier's IBS
kicks in because she eats

19:30.937 --> 19:32.772
too many cannolis mid-game,
and she rushes

19:32.872 --> 19:35.742
to the restroom mid-formation,
the person at the top

19:35.842 --> 19:38.211
comes a-tumbling down.
- What is the point?

19:38.311 --> 19:41.481
- My point is, once I make
a few phone calls

19:41.581 --> 19:43.750
to your other sales consultants,

19:43.850 --> 19:48.788
you, Vanessa, are gonna come
a-tumbling down.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.658
So what I guess
I'm trying to say is

19:51.758 --> 19:54.494
"Bitch better have my money."
- Tina, that doesn't

19:54.594 --> 19:56.596
really apply here.
- I don't care--I wanna say it.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.532
Bitch better have my money.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.201
- Enjoy sitting alone eating
spaghetti in a blazer

20:02.302 --> 20:04.571
that's clearly not
Dolce & Gabbana.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.606
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, no.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.575
It's Dressbarn, Vanessa,

20:08.675 --> 20:11.278
and everybody knows it.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.680
- Everyone.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.981
- Let's roll.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.853
- A prominent Danbury
businesswoman is being

20:21.954 --> 20:23.723
investigated for selling
a line of unsafe cosmetics.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.425
Oh, she's coming?

20:25.525 --> 20:28.395
Vanessa, what do you have
to say for yourself?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.297
Vanessa!
- You need to get those cameras

20:30.397 --> 20:31.464
out of my face.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.234
Don't--
Don't look at me!

20:35.335 --> 20:37.770
[grunting]

20:39.372 --> 20:41.674
- Whoa.
- Somebody must've

20:41.774 --> 20:44.544
called in a tip.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.546
[laughing]

20:46.646 --> 20:48.581
both: Tina?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.850
- Well, I think
we have our answer.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.986
- Oh, ah, ah!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.655
- That says it all.
