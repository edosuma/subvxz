00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
 ( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.806
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.809
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:12.545
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:16.416
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.449 --> 00:20.520
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:24.958
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.991 --> 00:27.961
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.994 --> 00:30.864
 <i>* Riding low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.897 --> 00:34.567
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:37.837
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.652 --> 00:55.822
<i>* It's all right</i>

00:55.855 --> 00:58.825

00:58.858 --> 01:02.462
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:31.391 --> 01:32.859
   Excuse me?

01:32.892 --> 01:34.861
Please, please, do not
apologize for existing.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.730
  How may I serve you?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.432
Isn't this Zack
Morris' locker?

01:39.466 --> 01:42.936
That is true.
While I am in your
country, we are sharing.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.971
 Do you know
 where Zack is?

01:45.005 --> 01:47.774
Yes I do.
His body went that way,

01:47.807 --> 01:49.776
  but his soul
  is in the gymnasium.

01:49.809 --> 01:51.111
   Thank you!

01:52.445 --> 01:53.847
 Things are not always
 as they seem.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.117
 It's me, Zack!

01:57.150 --> 01:58.985
   Why the disguise?

01:59.019 --> 02:01.054
  Lots of girls want to ask me
  to the dance,

02:01.087 --> 02:02.655
but I don't want to say
yes or no

02:02.689 --> 02:04.457
until I know if Kelly's
going to ask me.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.692
Simple.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.467
 Hi, Zack.
 Kelly.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.070
   So Kell, big dance
   Friday night, huh?

02:17.070 --> 02:18.538
   I haven't asked
   anyone yet, Zack.

02:18.571 --> 02:19.773
Really?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.509
 Well I just want you to know
 I'm keeping my calendar clear,

02:22.542 --> 02:23.510
if you know what I mean.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.845
I know what you mean...
You want me to ask you.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.947
  You could do worse.
  She could do better.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.583
 A lot better.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.519
 You don't think she'd consider
 going out with you?

02:32.552 --> 02:34.621
 Only if she wants
 to have a great time.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.855
In your dreams, Slater.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.090
In your face, "Preppy."

02:38.091 --> 02:39.693
  You're looking at her date.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.094
  Hmm, tough decision.

02:41.127 --> 02:42.996
 So many boys, so little time.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.867
 If I were you, Morris,
 I'd find someone else.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.737
  Hey Zack! Zackie!

02:50.770 --> 02:52.439
  Go get her, Zackie!

02:53.673 --> 02:55.408
 Hey, what's the rush,
 button nose?

02:57.577 --> 02:58.945
Slater, help me,
come on.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.388
   Give me a second.

03:08.888 --> 03:09.923
   All right.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.625
 Look, I've got nothing against
 Rhonda Robistelli.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.894
   But I do have this policy
   against dating anyone

03:14.928 --> 03:16.730
  who holds the school
  shot-put record.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.870
   All right, I kept my part
   of the bargain.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.406
 Here's your <i>"Seventeen,"</i>
<i>"Glamour,"</i> and <i>"Cosmo."</i>

03:27.073 --> 03:28.174
  What's this?

03:28.208 --> 03:31.177
 How'd the "Sports illustrated
 Swimsuit issue" get in here?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.746
  I have my needs too.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.849
  Never mind.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.584
   Who's Kelly going to take
   to the dance?

03:37.617 --> 03:39.152
   Well,
   according to my research,

03:39.185 --> 03:42.222
  Gina, Alex, and Rebecca
  think Kelly's asking Slater.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.157
   What do they know?

03:44.190 --> 03:46.626
  Connie, Didi and Raylene
  think she's leaning to you.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.094
  Smart girls.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.931
 Sue Ann thinks Kelly's
 going to ask Rodney Carter...

03:51.965 --> 03:53.900
 If his face clears up.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.104
 Well, remind me to buy Rodney
 a candy bar.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.408
Is that it Lisa?

04:01.441 --> 04:04.811
 Not all of it.
 I seem to be losing my memory.

04:04.844 --> 04:08.548
 All right, I'll do
 your history homework.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.684
  From you that's not a gift,
  that's a threat.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.055
  Come on. You had to find out
  more than that.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.457
 Maybe.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.493
   All right, all right.
   I'll sweeten up the deal.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.796
I'll give you my tickets
to the Bon Jovi concert.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.898
  Bon Jovi?
  You got it!

04:24.931 --> 04:26.700
  Okay, now what's the scoop?

04:26.733 --> 04:28.468
Kelly is
definitely taking you...

04:28.501 --> 04:29.636
 Thanks, Lisa.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.705
 ...or Slater.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.506
   Yeah.
   That's it?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.510
Well, Bon Jovi,
bon voyage.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.085
   So Slater, you got a date
   for the dance yet?

04:45.085 --> 04:47.287
  Hey,
  I've been turning them down
  left and right.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.923
Yeah, me too.
I turned down six girls.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.725
   That's nothing.
   I've turned down seven...

04:52.258 --> 04:54.561
 and a teacher.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.197
 You guys are
 so disgusting.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.265
 If either of you had
 an ounce of integrity,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.234
  you'd go with the first girl
  that asked you.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.136
And miss the excitement
of the hunt?

05:03.169 --> 05:04.604
Please, I'm eating here.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.241
 Hi.
 Kelly says she can make it to

05:08.274 --> 05:09.876
 your slumber
 party tomorrow night.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.578
  Hey, I'll be there...
 Great.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.646
   With my nightie,
   pimple cream and curlers.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.149
 No way, Jose.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.617
   Hey, it was worth a shot.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.820
   Hey, isn't a slumber party

05:20.854 --> 05:22.088
   where you girls
   spill your guts
   about everything?

05:22.122 --> 05:23.323
  Why?

05:23.356 --> 05:26.259
I'm sure Kelly will say
who she's going to
take to the dance,

05:26.292 --> 05:27.594
 then you can tell us.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.162
  Not if Kelly doesn't
  want us too.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.064
That would be invading
someone's privacy, Zack.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.233
I could live with that.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.536
 Why couldn't you live
 with a foreign family?

05:40.640 --> 05:43.910
 Hey Zack, a young lady
 asked me to give this to you.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.212
   All: Ooh!

05:46.246 --> 05:48.314
Oh, I almost forgot,
there's a message too...

05:52.085 --> 05:56.623
  "Dear Zack, my heart
  jumps for you."

05:58.391 --> 06:00.694
  Who?
  She loves you, kid.

06:00.727 --> 06:04.264
   Hey, Zackie!
   We've got to talk,
   hunk of mine.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.774
That boy has got
one cute behind.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.295
 Zack are you sure we should be
 bugging Jessie's bedroom?

06:35.328 --> 06:38.598
 We could get arrested, thrown
 in jail,
 lose our library cards!

06:40.200 --> 06:42.969
   Screech, this is the only
   chance you'll ever have

06:43.069 --> 06:46.139
  to find out Lisa's innermost
  thoughts about you.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.141
  What are we standing
  around for?

06:50.643 --> 06:52.645
  Hey, make sure
  you hide that well.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.247
  Okay, Zack.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.083
  I'll place the wire
  under this rug.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.887
You've got to admit this
about us, Screech...

07:01.821 --> 07:03.356
   I'm good.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.693
  Done, Zack.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.295
  Now I just have to make sure
  the wire's secure.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.032
 You're an electronics genius,
 "Screecher."

07:12.065 --> 07:13.800
   Jessie:
   Be there in a minute, Mom.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.735
   Ahhh!
   She's home! Hide!

07:40.760 --> 07:43.096
   Jessie: <i>Can you</i>
   <i>believe that Tony Kramer</i>
   <i>tried to make out with me</i>

07:43.129 --> 07:45.665
<i>in the middle of</i>
 Working Girls?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.067
What's wrong with that?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.869
  I didn't go with him.
  I went with Billy Bostwick.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.672
   Tony was sitting
   right behind us
   and what a jerk...

07:52.706 --> 07:54.441
  he left his
  retainer in my hair!

07:58.244 --> 08:00.246
Boys can be so
dumb sometimes.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.183
   Yeah, but they can
   be so cute, too.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.652
 Zack, she said
 we're cute!

08:05.685 --> 08:07.253
 I know, this is great.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.356
   Hey, now we have to listen
   for hidden meanings.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.391
  Pass the pepperoni.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.360
Lisa wants you.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.896
  She does,
  doesn't she?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.165
   I can just picture
   them now.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.708
  You're so lucky you found
  your Prince Charming, Lisa.

08:28.742 --> 08:33.145
Yeah, next to Screech,
River Phoenix is a drip.

08:33.179 --> 08:37.049
 I'm so jealous.
 May I have a lock of his hair?

08:37.049 --> 08:38.251
  Why?

08:38.284 --> 08:40.453
I want to grow
my own Screech in a jar.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.391
   Yeah, I know how you feel.

08:44.424 --> 08:47.360
 Screech is everything
 a girl could want.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.929
  He's strong, yet sensitive.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.165
 Funny, but not silly.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.234
 And he makes me tingle
 all over.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.870
  Both: Yeah.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.108
Zack, I make her tinkle.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.746
  -GIRL: <i>You know what?</i>
  -Quiet, listen.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.249
  Sometimes I wonder
  why God ever invented boys.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.418
To give us
something to talk about
at slumber parties.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.289
 Do you guys think
 I should cut my hair?

09:16.322 --> 09:19.359
   Who cares about your hair?
   Get back to boys.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.827
   I like it longer.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.095
 Well Jason wants me to cut it.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.732
Jason touches her hair,
he's a dead man.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.337
   Lisa, you would
   really cut your hair
   if some boy wanted you to?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.373
  Well, maybe.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.041
   If he was someone special,

09:35.041 --> 09:38.211
 who had the qualities
 of let's say, Michael Jackson.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.814
   All: Ooh!

09:40.847 --> 09:44.084
  Gentle, talented, gorgeous,
  and light on his feet.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.387
Hey, if that ain't you,
I don't know who it is.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.057
 What about you, Kelly?
 Who's your dream guy?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.059
  Here we go,
  here we go!

09:53.059 --> 09:54.461
 You know
 who really is a hunk?

09:54.494 --> 09:56.496
  Dennis Quaid!
  Who?

09:56.529 --> 09:57.931
( all sighing )

09:57.964 --> 09:59.332
   That wuss?

09:59.366 --> 10:01.835
  We know you're not taking
  Dennis Quaid to the dance...

10:01.868 --> 10:04.804
   So who are you going with?
   Slater or Zack?

10:04.838 --> 10:07.340
  Yes, yes!
  The moment of truth.

10:07.374 --> 10:11.478
  Well, there's something
  mysterious about AC Slater.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.980
   But Zack Morris
   is kind of cute
   in a playful way.

10:15.882 --> 10:19.219
  If I had to make my decision
  right now, I'd pick Zack.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.620
  Yes!

10:20.653 --> 10:21.888
  ( laughing )

10:22.389 --> 10:23.490
 What was that?

10:23.523 --> 10:26.059
 Go Lakers!
 Did you see that shot?

10:26.092 --> 10:27.394
   What shot?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.863
 That was Zack.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.364
 Well, what's he doing?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.466
That's weird, the Lakers
aren't playing tonight.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.077
 I don't believe this you guys.
 We've been bugged.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.311
   All: What?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.083
 What's wrong, Screech?

10:50.116 --> 10:52.385
 I don't know.
 Maybe the Lakers game
 interfered with it.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.387
There is no Lakers game,
you idiot.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.390
  Oh, yeah? Then what were you
  screaming at, you bonehead?

10:57.424 --> 11:01.127
Just fix it. it was just
starting to get good.

11:01.161 --> 11:05.198
 Of all the lowest, underhanded
 things... This is unreal.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.967
   To think a guy would go
   through all this trouble,

11:08.068 --> 11:10.103
   just to find out
   what a girl thinks of him.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.604
   It's so romantic.

11:11.638 --> 11:15.575
 No, it's so illegal.
 Zack's violating our privacy.

11:15.608 --> 11:19.079
   Look, guys,
   it's just a stupid prank.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.614
  Let's not get angry.
  Let's get even.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.183
   What do you mean?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.984
   I've got an idea
   to get Zack back.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.586
But I'm going to
need your help.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.896
 Okay, everybody ready?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.605
 Would you pass
 the cola?

11:45.638 --> 11:46.973
  Zack, it's working!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.777
<i>Okay, okay,</i>
<i>I've got a game.</i>

11:50.810 --> 11:54.180
 Every girl has to tell
 her deepest, darkest secret...

11:54.214 --> 11:57.350
   Something she's never told
   anyone before.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.054
   All right! We got it back
   just in time for
   the juicy stuff.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.891
  Okay, I'll go first.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.793
  It was in the mall.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.863
   I once stole...a
   tube of lipstick.

12:09.896 --> 12:10.930
   All: Whoa!

12:12.665 --> 12:13.767
Boring!

12:13.800 --> 12:15.301
  How about you Kelly?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.638
 Kelly: <i>Well, mine's more</i>
<i>serious than that.</i>

12:18.672 --> 12:20.874
   You see, whenever
   I like a boy,

12:20.907 --> 12:22.342
for some strange reason,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.378
 I end up hurting him.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.280
 You mean, you break up
 with him right?

12:27.313 --> 12:30.083
  No, I mean,
  I hurt him.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.285
  Ooh. This is creepy.

12:32.318 --> 12:35.822
You see, first I get
this terrible headache,

12:35.855 --> 12:38.391
then something happens,
and I snap.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.729
You poor thing.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.665
Zack, she sounds weird.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.768
   Quiet, I have
   to listen to this.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.871
I black out,
then wake up...

12:51.905 --> 12:55.742
  The police are
  there...and that poor boy...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.944
   The poor boy?
   The poor boy what?

12:57.977 --> 13:00.447
Zack, Kelly's dangerous.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.916
  Oh come on, Screech.
  She's a girl.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.287
   Zack, I'm worried.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.822
  Girls can be brutal.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.058
  You ever see
 <i>Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling?</i>

13:14.728 --> 13:17.130
Come on, you don't think
she's going to hurt me?

13:17.897 --> 13:19.099
Do you?

13:35.749 --> 13:37.250
  Oh, my God.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.954
I'm not like other boys.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.127
   You're not like anything
   on this planet, you dork!

13:48.228 --> 13:50.096
 I'd like you to share
 your life with me.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.900
  Screech,
  beat it, or I'll give you
  that high voice permanently.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.305
  Excuse me,
  "Michael," but we have
  a dress code at this school.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.807
My office. Now.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.108
 Mr. Belding, it's me Screech!

14:05.045 --> 14:07.247
Jessie, wait a second.
I've got to talk to you.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.417
 Talk fast, Zack. You don't...
 I mean,
 I don't have much time.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.119
 Well, I tried to
 call you all weekend
 and you're never home.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.822
   I know. I had to spend
   a lot of time with Kelly.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.824
 She really needed me.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.194
  She needed you?
  Something wrong with Kelly?

14:21.227 --> 14:24.264
 I really shouldn't be talking
 about this. I've got to go.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.900
  Jessie, what are you
  trying to tell me?

14:26.933 --> 14:30.136
 Look, Zack,
 I really care for you.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.340
Well, I just don't want
to see you get...hurt.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.075
   You mean
   emotionally hurt?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.743
 No, "Mike Tyson" hurt.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.913
  What are you trying
  to tell me?

14:39.946 --> 14:41.281
 Look, we've been
 friends all our lives

14:41.314 --> 14:43.083
  and I just don't want to see
  anything happen to you.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.354
 Goodbye, Zack.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.822
Goodbye?

14:48.855 --> 14:50.357
  Look, what is going on here?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.295
   Wow, what happened
   to you?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.097
   Hey, I don't want
   to talk about it.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.932
 What? Were you in an accident?

14:58.965 --> 15:01.167
 Fall down a flight of stairs?
 Well then, what?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.907
You swear
you won't tell anybody?

15:08.842 --> 15:10.176
  Yeah, sure.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.146
  Well, Kelly
  beat me up.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.849
She beat you up?

15:15.882 --> 15:18.318
 Yeah, I know.
  But you're on
  the wrestling team.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.552
 Its humiliating, Zack.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.321
You know, I should have
been able to take her.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.157
  Then what happened?

15:24.190 --> 15:26.092
Kelly asked me
over last night.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.495
   And it was going
   great for a while.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.463
But then she got
this terrible headache,

15:30.497 --> 15:32.332
 and then she
 turned on me.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.101
  I don't remember.
  Well, what'd she do?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.469
The next thing
I knew I woke up

15:36.503 --> 15:37.971
  and I was in
  some emergency room.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.173
 I'm telling you, Zack.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.474
( Zack gasping )

15:41.508 --> 15:43.977
   Please be careful.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.112
   She told me she likes you
   more than me.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.258
"Harris... Jennings..."

15:59.092 --> 16:00.860
   Bingo! "Kapowski."

16:02.028 --> 16:03.897
 I've got to find out
 the truth about Kelly.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.799
 That's why I'm looking
 through the principal's files.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.370
   Medical history...
   measles, mumps...

16:12.205 --> 16:14.307
   Oh no...
   Six months in the Riverside

16:14.341 --> 16:16.443
 Home for
 the Criminally insane?

16:18.478 --> 16:22.115
It's true.
She really is dangerous.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.851
Kelly wants to kill me.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.254
  Mr. Belding!

16:28.288 --> 16:30.123
   Morris, what are you doing
   in my office?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.158
  Mr. Belding, thank goodness
  you're here.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.526
   I need your help.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.929
  My life is being threatened
  by one of your students.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.630
   Just one?
   You're losing your touch.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.067
Mr. Belding,
this is serious.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.436
 Okay, okay, who is it?
 Terrible Tommy Tanner,

16:43.470 --> 16:45.872
  or Norman "No Neck" Nunzio?

16:45.905 --> 16:48.141
  Neither.
  Kelly "The Killer" Kapowski.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.077
Uh-huh.
Kelly Kapowski?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.079
Excuse me for a moment.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.948
  ( laughing )

16:59.219 --> 17:00.453
What's she going to do,

17:00.487 --> 17:02.055
   spike you to death
   with a volleyball?

17:03.056 --> 17:04.357
Look, this isn't funny.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.925
 It's like <i>Fatal Attraction...</i>

17:06.026 --> 17:07.359
   She loves me
   and I'm dead meat.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.096
   Zack, maybe you're making
   too much out of this.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.897
 When you're
 a ladies' man,

17:11.931 --> 17:13.433
  you're going to make
  girls mad sometimes.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.402
You cannot
please them all.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.171
  Look, you don't understand.
  Kelly gets these
  headaches and...

17:18.204 --> 17:20.040
They all get headaches,
Morris.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.243
Mr. Belding,
please help me!

17:24.277 --> 17:27.113
  Relax, Zack.
  I know where
  you're coming from.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.083
   Hey, I was also
   a big ladies' man.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.086
 Sometimes they're going to act
 a little out of sorts.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.954
  You just chalk it up
  to hormones.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.491
 You think
 that's all it is, sir?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.694
 I'm positive.
 Hey, I've been around.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.064
   You've got nothing
   to worry about.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.601
   Unless of course
   she's that one rare wacko

17:48.635 --> 17:50.270
  who's been in an institution
  or something.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.353
  Tonight's assignment
  will be chapter six.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.389
 "The Colon.
 Your friend for life."

18:11.124 --> 18:12.926
   <i>"My dearest Zack,</i>

18:13.026 --> 18:15.161
  <i>"you can run</i>
  <i>but you can't hide."</i>

18:18.231 --> 18:19.599
( bell ringing )

18:22.102 --> 18:24.170
Sorry, Zack. Clumsy me.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.318
  Will someone please
  call 911?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.689
   I finally have you
   all to myself.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.557
  Uh, what are you
  going to do with me?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.494
 And what's the bat for?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.629
   Softball practice, silly.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.631
 Sure, is that
 what you told Slater?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.234
   I want you, Zack.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.770
Not just for the dance,
but forever.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.538
Forever is such
a long time.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.574
But it can be
a very short time, too.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.382
 Don't fight it, Zack.
 You know you like me.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.519
   Sure I do, but...
   I also like cheeseburgers,

19:13.386 --> 19:15.488
 and I like the Lakers,

19:15.522 --> 19:18.124
   I like life. I love life.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.325
I want to live.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.393
 ( shrieking )

19:25.298 --> 19:29.202
   Kiss me, Zack, and change
   both of our lives forever.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.303
  ( groaning )

19:30.337 --> 19:31.404
  What, what?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.174
 I've got one of those
 headaches again.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.477
Me too.
I'll go get the aspirin.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.646
Come back, Zack, please.
What about the dance?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.047
 I already have a date.

19:41.081 --> 19:42.182
   With who?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.122
Is this a blast,
or what?

19:56.162 --> 20:00.467
 Rhonda, that's our 53rd dance.
 Can I please take a break?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.503
  Sure, take five.
  I'll go wash my face

20:03.536 --> 20:05.305
  and floss for later.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.781
Haven't you had enough?

20:14.814 --> 20:17.083
   I like living on the edge.

20:17.117 --> 20:19.386
Having fun with Rhonda,
Zackie?

20:19.419 --> 20:22.389
 I should have let you kill me
 when you had the chance.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.158
  I'm totally harmless, Zack.

20:25.191 --> 20:28.495
   I want to return something
   that belongs to you.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.430
   You mean you know
   we were listening?

20:30.463 --> 20:32.632
  Oh, I have something
  for you too, Zack.

20:32.665 --> 20:36.670
 A copy of Kelly's diploma from
 the Home for
 the Criminally insane.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.705
  Wait a minute.
  You planted this
  in Belding's files?

20:38.738 --> 20:42.442
   We both did.
   We flirted with
   danger and we won.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.211
   I knew you'd break
   into the files
   to check on Kelly.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.580
I know how your
sick mind works.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.615
 I can't believe this.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.618
 Hey, I've got another surprise
 for you, Zackie.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.388
  You can use this
  to fight off Rhonda.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.758
  You guys
  were all in on this?

21:00.393 --> 21:02.462
  I just have to know
  one thing, Kelly.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.531
  You were going to go
  to the dance with me, right?

21:04.564 --> 21:07.901
Guess you'll never know.
Come on, Slater.
Let's go dance.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.305
 Don't fade on me now,
 Zackie,

21:12.339 --> 21:14.140
I got big plans for us.

21:14.174 --> 21:15.809
   Yeah.
   Big plans?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.777
   Mom's visiting Dad
   in the slammer

21:17.811 --> 21:21.147
  and we got the house
  all to ourselves.

21:21.815 --> 21:24.617
Sorry, Rhonda,
I have a curfew.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.286
   I have to be home
   in 10 minutes.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.921
   Ow!
   That's all right.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.558
   How about
   a goodnight kiss?

21:31.591 --> 21:33.426
   I have very strict
   rules about that.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.362
I don't kiss on
the first date.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.965
Ah.
Lucky for us...

21:38.998 --> 21:40.700
 I do.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.435
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
