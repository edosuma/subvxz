WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.076
Really? A '71 Chevelle?

00:08.176 --> 00:10.611
Yep.
The SS with the 350 V8?

00:10.711 --> 00:12.946
Whitewall rally mags. Wow.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.583
Who knew Sergeant Straight-Laced
drives such a bitchin' car?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.085
Hey, I drive it, too.
Give me my money!

00:17.185 --> 00:18.586
Oh, well, at least someone
exceeds the speed limit in it.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.853
Help!

00:19.953 --> 00:21.722
Help! Police!

00:21.822 --> 00:23.091
Hey!
Hey! Whoa! Hey!

00:23.191 --> 00:24.525
Hand it over already!
Hey!

00:24.625 --> 00:26.827
Calm down. Hey, calm down, sir.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.996
She stiffed me on my change. Whoa.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.264
Let me guess. To buy more booze?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.599
Screw you.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.966
He gave me ten.
I gave him three back.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.735
That's correct change.
You only gave me two!

00:34.835 --> 00:36.770
Hey! Hey, hey.
Hey! Hey!

00:36.870 --> 00:39.006
Then why do you have three bills
in your hand, smart guy?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.008
Give me my money!

00:41.109 --> 00:42.576
Whoa! Okay.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.312
Put your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back!

00:44.412 --> 00:46.780
You're making a big mistake.
I'm gonna ruin your damn lives.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.482
Yeah, yeah, we've
heard that before.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.384
Let's go.
Come on, tough guy.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.419
<i>One word:</i>

00:51.519 --> 00:52.620
catnap.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.222
I'm pretty sure
that's two words.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.956
However many words it is,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.126
it's the only thing that got me
and Linda through our babies.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.364
Reagan.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.335
Yeah, I know Maggie Gibson. Why?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.404
Okay.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.605
Yeah, thanks, Detective.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.241
Something wrong
with our psychic?

01:13.341 --> 01:14.608
Maggie was stabbed.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.009
She's being rushed to the E.R.
right now.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.445
We got to go.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.750
What's this? They said
I was headed to Central Booking.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.052
Right after you chat with
our FIS, Sergeant Reagan.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.454
FIS?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.055
Field Intelligence Sergeant.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.123
Whatever that means.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.424
Well, what's more important is

01:30.524 --> 01:32.326
what you have for me.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.328
If you can give me
something good,

01:34.428 --> 01:37.631
I may be able to convince
the D.A. to go easy on your...

01:37.731 --> 01:38.966
catalytic converter theft.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.768
Yo, I don't know how
that got in my truck.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.271
Car parts just falling
from the sky these days?

01:43.371 --> 01:45.105
I blame climate change.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.943
You're out there ripping off
hardworking people, Gilbert.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.614
Do something good for a change
and help me help you.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.851
A'ight.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.955
You know all those guns
flooding these streets recently?

02:02.055 --> 02:03.524
Yeah, everyone here does.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.193
I know the dude who
sends out a text

02:05.293 --> 02:08.362
for buyers to show up
at a certain corner.

02:08.462 --> 02:12.132
Dude pulls up,
pops his trunk, game on.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.403
By the time 5-0 gets
wind, dude is long gone.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.770
Dude got a name?

02:16.870 --> 02:19.139
Sheree Shea.
That sounds like a woman's name.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.575
Okay, I don't know his name,
but Sheree's his boo.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.444
This is getting thinner
by the second.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.912
Yo, I swear,
I saw Sheree last week,

02:25.012 --> 02:27.114
and she says her man is
a one-stop Glock shop.

02:27.215 --> 02:30.184
Now, they hang 24/7,
so if you follow her...

02:30.284 --> 02:31.885
It leads right to him.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.258
And Lieutenant Doyle
from the Ceremonial Unit

02:37.358 --> 02:41.629
needs 15 minutes when you can
about the Connors funeral.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.632
End of day.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.701
Oh, Forty-Three's send-off's
gonna be a pip.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.605
I mean, the racket afterwards.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.507
Who or what is
Forty-Three?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.143
Bill Connors,
the late P.C.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.179
Who called him Forty-Three?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.981
Well, he called himself that.

03:01.081 --> 03:04.051
He was the 43rd
NYPD commissioner.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.854
So his friends started
calling him that, too.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.557
And so it was his enemies who
called him "Con-Game Connors"?

03:09.657 --> 03:11.191
Hey, respect.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.228
Listen, he wasn't perfect,
but he was loyal as they come.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.698
Loyal to who?

03:17.798 --> 03:19.867
To his fellow cops.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.403
In transit, where he started.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.472
In this office,
where he ended up.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.940
Right up to the end.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.876
And he never missed
a single walkout

03:28.976 --> 03:31.044
or racket when a cop retired.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.114
That's one way to look at it.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.083
Moving on.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.185
There another way?

03:38.286 --> 03:40.321
Yes.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.622
You want to call it?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.524
Maybe we put a pin in this?

03:44.325 --> 03:47.495
You might want to ask yourself,
if he was so great at the job,

03:47.595 --> 03:50.564
why did he suddenly resign?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.801
And why did
his chief of department-- me--

03:53.901 --> 03:56.504
get called up
to replace him the next day?

03:56.604 --> 03:57.705
Mistakes were made.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.172
That's an understatement.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.474
Knives were out.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.977
I'd like to take a
moment of silence

04:04.077 --> 04:08.516
in memory and respect
for Forty-Three.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.426
Mrs. Connors, sir.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.737
Thank you, Baker.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.010
Mrs. Connors.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.612
Oh. Julia, please.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.248
It's been 14 years
since I was Mrs. Connors.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.585
Please have a seat.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.233
My condolences.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.469
Thank you.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.505
You wanted to see me?

05:39.172 --> 05:42.175
I know something
that you don't know.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.279
Pretty much everybody does.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.216
About the circumstances of

05:49.316 --> 05:52.520
my husband's resignation
from this office.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.987
Yeah.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.823
Water under the bridge.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.660
All cards on the table.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.332
As you wish.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.902
If you remember,
the investigation started

06:09.002 --> 06:13.173
with a tip to Internal Affairs
from an anonymous source.

06:13.273 --> 06:16.477
Oh, I remember.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.947
Whose identity
was never revealed.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.818
Until now.

06:24.918 --> 06:28.188
Christmas bottles of scotch
turned into cash deposits.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.390
The golf outings at Bethpage

06:30.491 --> 06:32.926
turned into full-blown junkets
in the Bahamas.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.997
Again, water under the bridge.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.733
Really?

06:39.833 --> 06:40.801
How?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.603
What's done is done,

06:42.703 --> 06:46.339
and Bill Connors has passed.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.945
He kept up thousands of close
friendships in this department.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.248
So I'm told.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.585
He has two grown children.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.286
One's a sergeant
in the Miami P.D.,

06:59.386 --> 07:01.622
another an EMT
in New Haven.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.525
Well, that is
a fine legacy of service.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.696
The point is, anything less
than the full-blown

07:08.796 --> 07:11.431
police commissioner's send-off
for him...

07:11.532 --> 07:14.802
is gonna speak volumes.

07:17.671 --> 07:21.041
What makes you think
I'd do anything less?

07:21.875 --> 07:26.446
Well, I've kept up friendships
in this department as well.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.516
The head of your Ceremonial Unit

07:28.616 --> 07:30.784
was a Thanksgiving orphan
for us many times

07:30.884 --> 07:33.353
when he was under
Bill's command.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.925
I understand it's gonna be
less than a full salute.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.162
All cards on the table?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.764
Please.

07:45.365 --> 07:49.737
He was an effective cop
and front and center as P.C.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.939
during one of
the most difficult times

07:52.039 --> 07:54.174
in the history of this city.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.343
That's a real part
of his legacy.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.349
The other part is...

08:02.449 --> 08:04.818
he dishonored the department

08:04.918 --> 08:08.556
and especially this office
in the end.

08:09.723 --> 08:13.460
With his eyes wide open
and both hands grabbing.

08:17.598 --> 08:21.935
There's another thing I know
and you don't know.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.339
After his resignation
and up until his death,

08:26.439 --> 08:29.376
he worked for
God's Grace to All,

08:29.476 --> 08:34.081
the food bank,
60, 70 hours a week.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.250
For one dollar a year.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.320
And never told a soul.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.158
I think it's only fair
you add that

08:45.258 --> 08:47.661
to the right side of his ledger.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.601
Thanks for your time.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.077
Really?
Is he being released?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.013
Oh, hello, Officers.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.281
Come to apologize?
The apology owed is yours

09:08.381 --> 09:10.851
for harassing that vendor and
taking a swing at my partner.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.986
If my client was
such a public menace,

09:13.086 --> 09:15.388
would he be released on
a desk appearance ticket?

09:15.488 --> 09:17.591
Influence doesn't
equal innocence.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.760
Either way, we're leaving.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.631
Don't worry. I'll see you again.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.869
So young. Such a dick.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.805
Maybe the next one
will be a sweetheart.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.241
Um, I'll meet you at the car.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.876
Yeah.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.478
Whatever's making you so happy,
I want some of it, too.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.814
I got a lead on that mystery
gun dealer working our streets.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.850
Better yet, I just found out
the woman who's gonna lead me

09:42.950 --> 09:45.719
to him is already
conveniently parked on Rikers.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.722
You sure you're
all right?

09:48.822 --> 09:51.324
It's only one stab wound,
and the doctor said

09:51.424 --> 09:53.426
that it sutured up beautifully.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.962
Don't forget your concussion.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.463
Oh, it's minor.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.332
Well, don't worry,
we will find this guy.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.701
Eventually.

10:00.801 --> 10:04.037
No prints,
no witnesses.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.674
And your building's
security system is on the blink.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.442
And you saw nothing
during the attack at all?

10:09.542 --> 10:10.844
He came in from behind,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.180
and-and all I saw was a blur. Okay.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.249
But you told me before that
sometimes you get flashes

10:16.349 --> 10:18.018
when you're around bad energy.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.286
I would say today

10:19.386 --> 10:21.121
you were definitely around
some bad energy.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.133
Do you see something right now?

10:34.167 --> 10:35.268
Nothing.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.970
Okay. Um...

10:37.070 --> 10:38.105
No, no, no, no.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.441
I mean... nothing at all.

10:42.542 --> 10:47.547
Um, usually, there's a stream
of color behind my eyelids,

10:47.647 --> 10:50.784
and, um, when someone
speaks from beyond,

10:50.884 --> 10:54.054
their voice comes out of that.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.588
But it's gone.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.590
It's probably just
the concussion.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.859
No, what if it's really gone?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.260
What if the attack
took it from me

11:00.360 --> 11:01.494
and it's never gonna come back?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.563
What about enemies, Maggie?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.232
Did anyone ever threaten you?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.369
You know what?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.138
A few months ago,

11:11.238 --> 11:14.241
the husband of a woman
that I helped,

11:14.341 --> 11:17.677
he started screaming at me
in the grocery store.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.380
Spit was flying,
and his face was all red.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.718
And he was screaming that
I told his wife to divorce him.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.754
Well, that's not nothing.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.657
I call shotgun.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.159
Since when don't
you want to drive?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.027
Since I went out with a couple
college buddies last night

11:34.127 --> 11:35.829
and one beer
became a dozen beers,

11:35.929 --> 11:37.364
three shots and a strip club.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.701
Hey, partner, this is our ride.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.503
I want to show
you something.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.205
You didn't.
I did.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.706
You drove the Chevelle here?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.742
Figured you'd want to see
it in all its classic,

11:48.842 --> 11:54.181
1971 Chevy,
fuel-injected, LT1 glory.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.985
Oh, my God.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.592
No.

12:05.692 --> 12:06.994
How can you say no?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.196
It's two letters
and one syllable.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.663
It's very easy to pronounce.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.265
But I need her back out
on the street so that I can...

12:12.365 --> 12:15.869
And I need her in jail because
she's been arrested 46 times

12:15.969 --> 12:18.571
for shoplifting in
the past three years.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.573
And every time
she's released,

12:20.673 --> 12:24.111
we're hit with some
big headline like:

12:24.211 --> 12:28.248
"Sticky Fingers Sheree
Sprung to Steal Again."

12:28.348 --> 12:30.150
Well, what do you want
the headlines to read?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.286
That "D.A. Hopeful Erin Reagan
Stops Stealing Spree"?

12:33.386 --> 12:34.721
That's not fair.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.289
But accurate.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.426
Anthony, will you please
tell Jamie here that it's nuts

12:39.526 --> 12:40.961
to spin the revolving door

12:41.061 --> 12:43.696
and let Sheree Shea
back out on the streets?

12:43.797 --> 12:46.499
Sounds to me like
Jamie may have a point.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.734
What?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.602
What you always say to me.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.472
Uh, sometimes we got to let
a minor evil slide

12:52.572 --> 12:53.740
so we can stop a bigger one.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.309
Hmm. Okay, well,
then I will release her.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.577
Really?

12:57.677 --> 12:59.412
Yeah, and Anthony here
can go with you.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.780
Me?
Yes.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.149
I'm not volunteering.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.918
Oh, it certainly sounded
like you were.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.369
All right, my guy at Rikers said
she'd be dropped right here

13:22.469 --> 13:24.104
with her belongings
and a MetroCard.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.874
Jamie, I know how a
release works, okay?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.641
Yeah.
All right,
ladies, everyone out.

13:28.741 --> 13:31.611
See?
No one keeps Sheree in a cage.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.746
Free as a bird, baby!

13:35.082 --> 13:36.283
Later.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.684
Okay, I think a good plan
of action would...

13:37.784 --> 13:38.685
Yeah, and I also know

13:38.785 --> 13:39.719
how to follow a perp.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.554
Come on. Right.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.125
So, I parked the car
at 655 hours.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.593
There I am.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.061
So someone did this

13:48.161 --> 13:50.663
before we finished roll call
and headed out on patrol.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.432
There. There he is.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.736
Except...

14:00.007 --> 14:01.474
Is that a girl?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.144
Diane Tobin.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.213
You know her?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.481
We hooked up a couple times.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.751
And it just
fizzled out.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.354
Typical Big Apple romance,
you know?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.989
No, I don't know.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.492
I also don't know why the hell
she'd smash my windshield.

14:25.798 --> 14:26.900
You got a minute?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.436
Of course, boss.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.840
You got a bone to pick,
let's have it.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.508
That an order?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.611
Okay.

14:39.947 --> 14:45.252
Bill Connors may not have been
a shining example of everything,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.088
but he doesn't deserve--
nobody deserves--

14:48.188 --> 14:49.822
to be judged by their worst day.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.024
Worst day?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.126
Okay, bad patch.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.894
You got to put this guy
in context.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.696
God rest his soul.
I do.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.666
He was there for us as cops,
as a C.O., as a P.C.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.068
Yeah, I know.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.770
He never missed a walkout
or a retirement racket.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.306
Well, that counts for a lot
in the great scheme of things.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.308
Well, there is another way
to look at it,

15:08.408 --> 15:11.511
the way the guy
who sits in my chair

15:11.611 --> 15:15.148
has an obligation to look at it.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.117
Yeah, okay, what?

15:17.217 --> 15:19.519
Well, all that really means is

15:19.619 --> 15:22.889
Bill Connors never missed
a parade or an open bar.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.391
That's not a knock,

15:24.491 --> 15:27.560
but it's hardly a hallmark
of distinguished service.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.835
That investigation turned up
a breathtaking amount of graft,

15:35.935 --> 15:41.008
patronage, abuse of office,
even outright theft.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.278
But...

15:47.547 --> 15:51.018
...the thing
I couldn't get past...

15:52.285 --> 15:53.920
Not to leave this room.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.523
Go ahead.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.960
On 9/12, the NYPD took
an apartment

16:01.061 --> 16:02.429
a couple blocks from the scene

16:02.529 --> 16:04.564
so that the chiefs
who were working down there

16:04.664 --> 16:09.836
would have a place
to take a break, eat a meal,

16:09.936 --> 16:11.804
maybe even cry.

16:12.872 --> 16:16.376
Bill Connors kept that apartment
forever after

16:16.476 --> 16:19.712
on the NYPD's dime.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.050
Had it remodeled,
stocked with booze,

16:23.150 --> 16:26.586
stocked with food
from Nobu and Delmonico's,

16:26.686 --> 16:29.722
all on the NYPD's dime.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.962
And all so he could
entertain his girlfriends.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.667
Who does that?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.804
Boss.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.373
But you guys,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.508
P.C.s,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.610
you're kind of like
New York's popes.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.347
Stretch like that, you're
gonna pull a hamstring, Sid.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.483
No, no, no. Hear me out.

16:58.085 --> 17:03.790
Pope Leo the Fifth may have
hated Pope Leo the Fourth,

17:03.890 --> 17:08.795
but he would never disrespect
him by skimping on the funeral.

17:08.895 --> 17:12.232
It'd be a slap against
the whole institution,

17:12.332 --> 17:14.767
not just his predecessor.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.606
Boss, it's just not done.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.117
For someone who's been in jail,
she's certainly in no rush

17:30.217 --> 17:31.384
to see
her gun-selling boyfriend.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.853
Well, maybe she
made you already.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.054
Me?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.457
Kid, your whole
vibe screams cop.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.392
I mean, e-even
in plain clothes,

17:39.492 --> 17:42.362
it looks like you're
marching in dress blues.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.768
And now she's stealing.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.770
Yeah, relax.
That's-that's what she does.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.739
What, and we got to
watch her do it?

17:52.839 --> 17:54.874
Yeah.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.811
Uh-oh, incoming.
Hey!

17:58.911 --> 18:00.547
Hey, how you doing, Carl?
How are you, man?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.549
Wow, it's been
a long time.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.217
I haven't seen you
in, like, forever.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.153
We're the police. We need you
to let that woman just keep

18:06.253 --> 18:08.388
doing what she's doing.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.123
She's putting merchandise
down her shirt.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.358
And we got to let her.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.692
Yeah, even if it kills us.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.394
So, how are the twins?

18:14.494 --> 18:15.495
They got to be
as tall as you

18:15.595 --> 18:16.729
these days, huh? Wow.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.231
See ya.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.333
And who the hell is Carl?

18:22.802 --> 18:25.272
He had an alibi?

18:25.372 --> 18:26.806
Just like he
sneered he would.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.009
Well, right now, that is
the least of my problems.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.011
You still can't see
to the other side?

18:32.111 --> 18:35.882
And many times in my life
I've called it a curse.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.418
When I was six, I went
to our priest and asked him

18:38.518 --> 18:40.953
if God gave me this
because he hated me.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.489
But then

18:42.589 --> 18:45.758
people started coming to me,
and I could help you guys.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.860
Well, look,
it's gonna come back, Maggie.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.196
It will.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.764
Well, Danny, listen,
I hope that you are right

18:51.864 --> 18:54.100
because I'm just gonna be
a sitting duck

18:54.201 --> 18:57.570
if this guy decides
to come back and finish the job.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.105
They are discharging me.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.373
They can't discharge you.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.774
You're healing. You can't leave.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.510
Insurance says I'm ready to go.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.077
Hey, well, screw the insurance.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.479
I'm gonna say something
to the doc so you can stay.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.514
No, no, no, no, no.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.816
You could come home with me.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.185
Really?

19:12.285 --> 19:15.888
Yeah. As long as you don't mind
a baby crying from time to time.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.098
Luis.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.200
Diane.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.535
I guess I know why you're here.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.936
She doesn't
even deny it.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.505
Whatever you think he is,
he's not. Trust me.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.274
Save yourself
the trouble.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.508
What are you talking about?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.176
I mean, we kind of
even look alike.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.745
He obviously has a type.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.280
Yeah, so do I: my husband.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.649
Eddie, she confessed.
We got what we need.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.384
Well, don't worry, Eddie.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.487
You'll find out when one day he
just up and disappears on you.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.622
Like he did to me
after ten months together.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.491
Well, like I said,
I have a husband.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.825
But ten months?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.093
I thought that was
just a couple times.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.061
It doesn't matter.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.162
Put your hands behind your back.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.497
What's wrong with me, Luis?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.932
Was I
such a terrible person?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.901
Did you get scared when I said
we should move in together?

20:02.001 --> 20:05.438
Diane, we've been through
this a million times.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.574
Just... just tell me what I did
wrong, and I'll leave you alone.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.609
Okay, we're done here.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.910
Do you want this collar or not?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.379
What I want is not to have been

20:12.479 --> 20:14.581
dragged into this crap storm
by my own partner.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.317
If you want to stay
and explain yourself, fine.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.018
I'm leaving.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.828
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts which we are

20:28.928 --> 20:30.330
about to receive
from thy bounty,

20:30.430 --> 20:31.564
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.466
Please excuse
any nummy noises

20:33.566 --> 20:37.270
coming from me 'cause these
scalloped potatoes look amazing.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.571
Kind of gotten
used to all the noises

20:38.671 --> 20:39.972
that come from
that side of the table.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.441
Hey, where's my fork?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.910
Up your butt and
around the corner.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.111
What did you say?

20:45.211 --> 20:46.679
Excuse me?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.681
What? You guys have
never heard that one before?

20:48.781 --> 20:49.816
Never.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.250
Not once. No.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.852
Kids at school used to
say it all the time.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.956
Wow. My school, we said, uh, "Up
your nose with a rubber hose."

20:57.056 --> 20:58.358
At least that rhymed.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.992
Or maybe "I'm rubber,
you're glue," but...

21:00.092 --> 21:01.661
I don't know. I kind of like it.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.695
Thank you.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.130
You?

21:04.230 --> 21:05.465
That sounds like
an appropriate place

21:05.565 --> 21:08.768
to send Bill Connors
for his funeral.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.503
Pop.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.207
We do not speak ill of the dead
at this table.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.576
Unless you got a good reason.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.710
Where do I start?

21:17.810 --> 21:21.247
From the day Pop left One PP,

21:21.348 --> 21:23.282
he has been under the impression

21:23.383 --> 21:26.819
that Bill Connors somehow
was behind his dismissal.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.321
Somehow?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.923
The guy had the mayor's ear
at the time.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.525
And that's where this stops.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.461
What, are you saying I'm wrong?

21:35.662 --> 21:38.998
No, I'm just saying
it's complicated,

21:39.098 --> 21:42.234
like everything else in life.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.271
Okay?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.578
Okay.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.481
Thank you. End of discussion.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.852
Oh.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.888
Here it is. It was in my lap.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.022
Mystery solved.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.857
Here's another mystery, Jamie.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.394
Why are you here
and not following

22:07.494 --> 22:08.895
that woman I
released for you?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.863
Anthony said he'd sit on her
for a couple hours.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.532
Poor woman. She'll suffocate.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.534
Sit on her house.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.103
Oh. Sit on her house. Right.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.105
Okay, here's a question.

22:19.205 --> 22:24.611
Who's the person that broke your
heart, and how did you react?

22:24.711 --> 22:25.812
Mine was

22:25.912 --> 22:27.680
Scott Andrews.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.750
I was in sixth grade,
and I bawled for days.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.084
Angela Ramsey.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.186
I definitely sniffled
a few times over her.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.588
Burt Bailey.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.258
Dumped me right before
the prom, and I was mad.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.427
Yeah.
TP'd his house.

22:40.527 --> 22:41.994
What about you, Gramps?

22:42.094 --> 22:44.096
Louise Tattersol.

22:44.196 --> 22:49.035
She drove me right into Betty's
arms, and I never looked back.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.937
Aw.
Good for him.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.304
Dad?

22:54.941 --> 22:58.377
Well, she didn't exactly do it
on purpose,

22:58.478 --> 23:01.313
but it certainly broke my heart.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.850
So I did what the rest
of us did: drove back home

23:03.950 --> 23:07.654
from the cemetery
and cried around this table.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.859
Mm. Yeah, Dad.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.363
Way to bring
the room down, hon.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.300
Yeah, where do
we go from here?

23:22.502 --> 23:24.504
Up your butt
and around the corner.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.972
Whoa!

23:26.072 --> 23:27.306
Whoa.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.742
Good one.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.045
She's so beautiful.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.582
And clearly loves you.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.718
Yeah, somehow I've always had
a knack of calming down babies.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.120
Oh. Well, that makes one of us.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.490
For some reason, growing up,

23:43.590 --> 23:45.257
I always kept them
at a distance,

23:45.357 --> 23:49.261
like they were something I was
supposed to take a photo with

23:49.361 --> 23:52.164
until a family member
took 'em back.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.433
Until you looked
into her little eyes.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.402
Yes.

23:56.503 --> 23:59.338
And then my whole world
turned upside down,

23:59.438 --> 24:01.107
like I could never imagine.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.309
Yeah.

24:03.409 --> 24:06.913
Thank you, Maria,
for taking me in.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.381
I know you've had your doubts
about what I do.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.651
Or what I used to do.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.854
Oh. Oh.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.424
Hey.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.560
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.742
I-I can't remember
the rest of that lullaby

24:35.842 --> 24:38.010
after so many years.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.014
Your daughter.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.216
She's the reason why

24:44.316 --> 24:46.553
losing your gift hurts so much?

24:49.055 --> 24:50.623
Yeah.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.395
Ever since the minute
that Jeanette was murdered,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.565
every night

24:58.665 --> 25:02.034
before I fall asleep, I see her.

25:03.703 --> 25:07.740
And she's as alive
and beautiful as ever.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.310
And even if it's only for
one moment...

25:13.913 --> 25:16.515
...our hearts are
together again.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.451
And so if that goes away,

25:19.552 --> 25:21.754
I don't...

25:21.854 --> 25:22.589
I'm sorry.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.891
If that goes away...

25:32.665 --> 25:33.933
<i>You're mad at me?</i>

25:34.033 --> 25:36.135
You're the one who made us
look like fools.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.436
Because you
lied to me.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.706
I told you,
it's complicated.

25:39.806 --> 25:40.907
Okay.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.341
There are two people
in every relationship,

25:42.441 --> 25:43.743
and Diane isn't an angel.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.245
Does she have a
criminal record?

25:46.345 --> 25:48.114
I don't think so.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.481
I want to
talk to her.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.283
Like, alone?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.819
I may not know the whole story,

25:52.919 --> 25:54.921
but I can tell
when someone's been hurt

25:55.021 --> 25:57.256
and does something
out of desperation.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.726
So maybe she deserves something
besides handcuffs.

25:59.826 --> 26:00.927
Eddie...

26:01.027 --> 26:02.261
Just tell me
where I can find her.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.782
I beat you to it.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.687
My first time here, too.

26:29.956 --> 26:34.460
You're thinking, "How did she
know I'd want to see for myself

26:34.560 --> 26:37.897
how complete was
Bill Connors' transformation?"

26:37.997 --> 26:39.699
You really think
you can read me?

26:39.799 --> 26:42.234
I really think I can read a cop.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.203
I was married to one.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.506
And I can read
a police commissioner.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.608
I was married
to one of them, too.

26:52.178 --> 26:55.581
Trust but verify.

26:58.084 --> 27:02.554
If you guys had
an honest motto, that'd be it.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.663
And not to sound like
a, uh, broken record...

27:12.832 --> 27:15.467
...but I know something
you don't know.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.521
Hmm.

27:39.491 --> 27:43.730
Apparently, he kept
a neat office.

27:45.497 --> 27:49.836
Leave it to Bill Connors
to find himself a no-show job.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.974
How little of his story
was true?

27:57.844 --> 28:01.814
When I got here, I asked around.

28:01.914 --> 28:07.019
The, uh, 60 hours a week
were more like 60 minutes.

28:07.119 --> 28:11.758
And 50 of the 60 were
hitting on the female staffers.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.064
I'm sorry, Julia.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.167
Seems like
the only good he did was

28:21.267 --> 28:24.203
working those benefit galas
for donations.

28:24.303 --> 28:28.074
Well, that's something.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.441
Yeah.

28:29.541 --> 28:34.113
They also serve
who glad-hand and backslap.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.823
I hate this.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.258
I mean, this is the last straw.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.000
Whatever you want to do.

28:54.100 --> 28:58.604
I certainly, uh, wouldn't expect
you to speak at his service.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.945
Everyone else will.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.016
What the hell would you say?

29:12.351 --> 29:15.554
Now I know something
you don't know.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.293
Uh, one-top's
all yours, Diane.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.561
Thanks.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.901
Welcome to The Lowery.
Can I get you something to...?

29:30.169 --> 29:36.008
OEM windshield on that car
run you about a thousand bucks.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.277
You run,

29:38.377 --> 29:39.278
you're toast.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.747
You sit, we'll talk.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.189
It's Eddie, right?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.991
Start with Officer Janko.

29:52.091 --> 29:55.494
Officer Janko, I am so sorry
for what I did the other day,

29:55.594 --> 29:57.163
all of it.

29:57.263 --> 30:00.466
It would've been a lot easier
if you felt that way beforehand.

30:00.566 --> 30:01.467
I know.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.402
It's just...

30:05.204 --> 30:07.806
My whole life has been
a spiral lately.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.876
First the pandemic,
then losing my job

30:09.976 --> 30:12.378
and having to take this one.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.080
And then Luis ghosting you.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.149
Right at
the worst possible time.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.921
After he left like that,
I just lost it.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.356
I knew what precinct
he worked at,

30:24.456 --> 30:26.092
so I went there
a couple times

30:26.192 --> 30:30.062
and saw you two outside,
usually laughing and joking.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.432
That's 'cause we're partners.
That's it.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.500
End of story.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.137
How could I have done all that?

30:38.971 --> 30:41.840
Well, maybe it's like you said.

30:41.941 --> 30:46.212
We're two beautiful women,
and maybe he has a type.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.314
I feel horrible.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.381
I am horrible.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.983
No, you're not.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.919
I have a feeling
you're a really good person

30:53.019 --> 30:55.054
who made a really bad mistake.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.358
Put it in the rearview mirror.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.494
Seriously?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.496
One "get out of jail free"
card, Diane.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.699
Use it well.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.770
It's so nice to meet
one of the good cops.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.572
There are a lot of us.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.942
Just keep your eyes open.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.846
Sweet dreams, little angel.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.149
Yeah, it sounds like a
distinct possibility.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.217
All right.
Thanks, Reagan.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.552
Any luck?

31:26.652 --> 31:29.588
He ran down
your landlord, your ex

31:29.688 --> 31:30.822
and any and all
disgruntled clients.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.724
And nothing?

31:32.824 --> 31:34.961
We're starting to think
maybe it was just

31:35.061 --> 31:37.163
some random psycho
who flipped his lid.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.332
Oh. Well, then
maybe I can go home.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.101
You don't have to.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.769
But if it was random,
then he's not coming back.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.972
And besides,
I can't hide forever.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.539
Hold on.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.641
Detective Stafford said that
you helped him with a case.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.642
What was it?

31:50.742 --> 31:51.877
Oh, yeah.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.980
Um, a few years ago...

31:55.581 --> 31:59.118
...uh, I was walking through
Central Park,

31:59.218 --> 32:01.053
and I saw this young man
on a bench

32:01.153 --> 32:04.923
with his head in his hands,
and he was really upset.

32:05.024 --> 32:08.660
And suddenly, uh,
a voice came and said,

32:08.760 --> 32:10.696
"Tell my brother I forgive him."

32:10.796 --> 32:12.864
Bench guy was the brother?

32:13.665 --> 32:16.802
But when I told him that,
he didn't seem comforted.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.770
He got even more freaked out.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.339
Like he had a guilty conscience.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.375
Yeah, and I gave him my card
in case he wanted to talk,

32:23.475 --> 32:25.344
but then he just ran off.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.347
And then, like, a week later,
Detective Stafford called me

32:28.447 --> 32:30.649
and said that a man
showed up at the station

32:30.749 --> 32:33.485
and confessed to killing
his brother over borrowed money,

32:33.585 --> 32:35.988
all because of a lady
he talked to in the park.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.623
Did Stafford give you his name?

32:37.723 --> 32:40.059
No, he just said that he was
definitely going to prison.

32:40.159 --> 32:43.829
Huh. Well, I'll have Danny
talk to Stafford.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.765
Jamie, this is useless.

32:46.865 --> 32:48.000
She's gonna call him.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.968
Listen, maybe
your C.I. is wrong

32:50.069 --> 32:52.438
and-and she doesn't
even know the gun guy.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.340
Anthony, if she can
lead us to this guy...

32:54.440 --> 32:56.208
Look, kid, it's been
a noble effort,

32:56.308 --> 32:58.644
but in five minutes, she's
going back to Rikers.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.479
I'm telling you.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.283
Yeah.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.591
Oh!
Hey! Sheree!

33:12.691 --> 33:14.360
Hey! Police!

33:17.896 --> 33:20.399
Oh!
Hey!

33:39.051 --> 33:40.952
Go, go, go!
Stop! Police! Stop!

33:48.894 --> 33:51.330
She jumped in the car with
some guy. Maybe the boyfriend?

33:51.430 --> 33:52.731
You get the plate?

33:52.831 --> 33:54.400
No, it didn't have one.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.936
We got to find her somehow,
before your sister finds out.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.013
Yeah. Over there.
Okay, thanks.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.584
Surprised Stafford
gave you the time of day.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.154
Well, I can be very
charming when I want to be.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.856
I also promised him the
collar if we nailed this guy.

34:17.956 --> 34:20.159
Speaking of.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.160
Hey. Arthur Bava.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.594
Who's asking?

34:23.395 --> 34:25.797
Detective Reagan
and Baez.

34:25.897 --> 34:26.832
Then I'm busy.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.167
Take a break.

34:28.967 --> 34:30.669
Keep your hands where
we can see them.

34:30.769 --> 34:31.903
We just wanted to

34:32.003 --> 34:33.239
congratulate you
on worming your way

34:33.339 --> 34:34.540
out of prison last week.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.108
I didn't worm my way
out of nothing.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.444
You see, they let me out
'cause I'm innocent.

34:38.544 --> 34:40.112
We know you got out
on a technicality.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.148
We know you killed your brother
over money.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.482
The hell I did.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.016
You know, that whole thing
was a setup,

34:45.117 --> 34:47.319
starting with the crazy lady
got inside of my head

34:47.419 --> 34:48.654
and made me confess to the cops.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.722
Same "crazy lady"
you told your cellmate

34:50.822 --> 34:52.924
you were gonna kill
for making you confess?

34:53.024 --> 34:55.093
Dude's full of it.
No, he got it
right this time.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.129
She was stabbed a few days ago

34:57.229 --> 35:00.399
and bled out right there
in the lobby of her building.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.070
She dead?
Sadly.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.972
Bet that makes you happy.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.640
No.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.276
I'll say a prayer for her.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.843
I'm a God-fearing man.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.612
Oh. Okay.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.514
Well, it's good to know
you weren't involved, then.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.049
Have a nice day, Mr. Bava.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.831
Okay. Just tell me why.

35:32.931 --> 35:35.567
Why I let Diane off
with a warning?

35:35.667 --> 35:37.369
I know
why you did that.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.770
You call her?

35:38.870 --> 35:41.973
About a dozen times
before she picked up.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.710
And I apologized for what I did.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.714
So why what?

35:48.814 --> 35:51.350
Why you got to go out of
your way in the first place?

35:51.450 --> 35:53.985
Especially these days when it
gets a cop nothing but grief.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.354
Not if you fight it.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.922
So you like the fight.

35:57.022 --> 36:00.058
I like the fact that patrol is
one of the few spots left

36:00.158 --> 36:02.461
where you can
still make a difference

36:02.561 --> 36:04.763
before things
really go sideways.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.064
Unlike, say, a detective,

36:06.164 --> 36:08.367
who only shows up
after someone's dead.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.969
Guess we are lucky that way.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.205
Yeah, we should do our best
to spread that luck around,

36:13.305 --> 36:15.207
keep things from getting worse
if we can.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.476
Well, you did that with Diane.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.177
So thanks.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.414
Another Janko lesson learned.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.949
I know you think Jamie is

36:24.049 --> 36:26.652
Sergeant Straight-Laced
or whatever,

36:26.752 --> 36:29.388
but I think you could take
a lesson from him

36:29.488 --> 36:30.656
on how to treat women.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.991
Like marrying
one of my coworkers?

36:33.091 --> 36:35.761
Can we do this?
Oh, please. After you.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.400
Gilbert, I don't want
to go with you.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.734
Baby, it'll be great.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.102
Couple days in Cape May,
just like before.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.671
Yeah, before we broke up.

36:45.771 --> 36:46.972
Look, I go through all of this
trouble to get you sprung,

36:47.072 --> 36:48.274
and this is the
thanks I get?

36:48.374 --> 36:49.241
If Vince finds out,
we're dead!

36:50.542 --> 36:51.977
Oh, so Vince is
his name, huh?

36:53.379 --> 36:55.414
He have a last name?
Uh, Sergeant Reagan.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.015
Took me a moment to figure out
that you played me.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.584
I'll give you that.
You got to understand,

36:58.684 --> 36:59.785
I love her.

36:59.885 --> 37:00.986
Well, I don't love you.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.289
And I sure as hell
don't love pigs.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.157
Welcome to a rock
and a hard place.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.926
Only way out is to take
us to your boyfriend

37:08.026 --> 37:09.761
before he sells any
more guns to criminals.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.968
All right. Night, Mr. G.
Good night.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.204
Yeah, see you
in the morning.

37:25.176 --> 37:26.812
Mr. G?

37:55.707 --> 37:57.843
No. You ain't alive.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.579
They told me
I killed you.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.349
I did.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.083
I swear I killed you.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.452
Drop the knife!

38:06.552 --> 38:09.721
Or the next dead person
you see's gonna be yourself.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.391
You okay over
there, Maggie?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.192
Never better.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.162
Keep your face forward.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.373
In the office.
Thank you.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.808
Sergeant Reagan, look,
you got to believe me,

38:29.908 --> 38:30.976
I was trying to help you.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.878
He was trying
to kidnap me.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.446
Put her in the cell here,
lodge the other two upstairs

38:34.546 --> 38:36.382
in the squad.
Hey, want to make
a deal with me?

38:36.482 --> 38:38.750
'Cause I can give you the guys
that supplied me those guns.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.051
Just get him out of here.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.553
Yeah, don't let 'em talk.
This guy.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.322
Looks like congrats
are in order.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.625
Hey, Erin, you didn't
have to come here.

38:46.725 --> 38:47.926
Well, I did.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.629
I doubted you, and
you proved me wrong.

38:50.729 --> 38:51.730
What, just him?

38:51.830 --> 38:54.299
Okay, you get a cookie, too.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.834
Uh, damn straight I get one.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.168
Thank you, sis.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.637
But maybe next time,

38:58.737 --> 39:00.171
if you need
a defendant released,

39:00.271 --> 39:03.208
you don't give me
a heart attack by losing her.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.644
What? We never lost Sheree.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.345
We had eyes on her
the whole time.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.648
Oh, yeah, she was never out
of our sight, not for a second.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.149
No.
I can see her right now.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.451
Mm-hmm, right.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.819
You, let's go.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.854
All right. All right.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.656
Mm-mm.
I'll see you, pal.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.327
I can't thank
you two enough.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.495
You don't have to thank us.

39:23.595 --> 39:24.763
We're just glad you're okay.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.332
But Elena
will miss you.

39:27.433 --> 39:30.602
Well, guess what, I am
available to babysit anytime.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.270
Count on it.

39:34.372 --> 39:38.143
By the way, last night around
00, Elena started crying,

39:38.243 --> 39:39.745
and I got her,

39:39.845 --> 39:43.148
and we sat
in the living room, and...

39:43.248 --> 39:47.686
suddenly my daughter was
right beside me.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.490
You're maybe starting
to get your gift back?

39:51.590 --> 39:53.892
I felt her.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.729
And sh-she reminded me
of the words of that lullaby,

39:57.829 --> 40:00.766
and then we sang Elena
back to sleep.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.734
Every mom needs her daughter.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.307
You never said a word
about my eulogy.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.142
What do you want to hear?

40:45.310 --> 40:47.045
Ah, come on, Pop.

40:47.145 --> 40:50.181
You ate all that crow,

40:50.281 --> 40:53.118
and you never took
a single sip of water.

40:55.053 --> 40:58.223
Well, never kick a man
when he's down,

40:58.323 --> 41:00.526
and this one was
lying in his coffin.

41:03.529 --> 41:07.032
Sitting with his widow
and the children after

41:07.132 --> 41:10.201
was a genuinely nice touch.

41:15.507 --> 41:19.578
Sid said there was
some grumbling about no flyover.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.013
Yeah, let 'em grumble.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.917
You honored the office
if not the man.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.353
What's that
Chaucer line?

41:29.154 --> 41:33.525
"The evil that men do
lives after them;

41:33.625 --> 41:37.128
the good is oft interred
with their bones."

41:38.396 --> 41:40.999
That's Shakespeare,
<i>Julius Caesar.</i>

41:43.702 --> 41:45.270
Look at you.

41:48.974 --> 41:52.410
To, uh, balance the ledger,

41:52.510 --> 41:56.381
I am, uh, taking the savings
from the funeral

41:56.481 --> 41:59.484
and donating it
to God's Grace to All.

41:59.585 --> 42:02.120
In Bill Connors' name?

42:02.220 --> 42:05.123
In his family's name.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.492
Threading the needle.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.930
I learned from the best.

42:17.068 --> 42:18.436
Good night, Pop.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.310
Night, Francis.
