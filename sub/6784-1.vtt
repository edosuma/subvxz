02:41.921 --> 02:43.994
There are kids
who are here for gifts.

02:44.042 --> 02:46.997
- I don't want to.
- I know, but you can not blame them.

02:51.066 --> 02:52.436
<i>Christmas's Eve.</i>

02:52.753 --> 02:55.689
<i>Well, let's hope
it's better than last year.</i>

02:59.692 --> 03:03.182

03:03.380 --> 03:04.395
<i>Uah!</i>

03:04.442 --> 03:06.902
<i>A Merry blooming Christmas that was.</i>

03:07.675 --> 03:10.489
<i>Remember,
Christmas is the time for giving.</i>

03:10.725 --> 03:13.978
<i>Although, all I was given
last year was the flu.</i>

03:23.727 --> 03:27.141
<i>Be careful if you're driving,
as they're predicting a storm.</i>

03:27.287 --> 03:29.740
<i>Which certainly will be at our house.</i>

03:29.854 --> 03:32.346

03:35.337 --> 03:38.494
<i>And it only happens once a year.</i>

03:39.447 --> 03:41.049
I would have done those myself

03:41.089 --> 03:43.552
if I've known you were gonna
do such desperate job. Here!

03:43.585 --> 03:45.837
You're eight months pregnant.
I couldn't let you do that.

03:45.863 --> 03:47.612
Yeah, but you let me
do the cooking, though.

03:47.637 --> 03:50.611
Yeah, I think burnt pastry
is definitely underrated.

03:50.643 --> 03:53.167
Underrated?
You wait a minute.

03:58.983 --> 04:00.383
Tada!

04:01.293 --> 04:05.136
Don't think that you can win
me over with gifts, Mr. O'Hanlon.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.136
Oh.

04:10.130 --> 04:14.593
Sotto la Stella, e il miracola dell amore.
(Under the star, is the miracle of love)

04:15.000 --> 04:16.993
Gracias, amore mio.
(Thank you, my love)

04:17.326 --> 04:19.238
Thank you, my darling.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.343
You have to admit,

04:22.403 --> 04:24.791
I did a great job
with the lights this year.

04:30.572 --> 04:33.422
Oh! Oh...
È calo! (It's coming!)

04:33.465 --> 04:36.088
Calm down, Maria. It's just a sparker.
Must be the bad weather.

04:36.135 --> 04:38.468
È calo! Arriva! (Comes!)
It, it's coming, Joe.

04:38.502 --> 04:39.922
Just a storm.
Don't worry.

04:39.952 --> 04:42.258
No, Joe, the baby.
The baby's coming.

04:42.298 --> 04:43.978
What? Oh! Hey!
Jeepers!

04:44.034 --> 04:45.165
Hey, wait!

04:45.281 --> 04:47.621
Keys!
Where are my favorite keys?

04:47.848 --> 04:51.683
Ooh!
Breathe! Calm! Focus!

04:51.745 --> 04:53.471
Yes.
In fact...

04:54.045 --> 04:55.234
I'm okay.

04:55.315 --> 04:56.325
Right.

04:56.385 --> 04:58.305
Well, get me to the hospital then.

04:58.535 --> 05:00.471
- Right.
- Oh!

05:06.590 --> 05:08.955
Joe, you're going up the mountain.

05:09.362 --> 05:11.295
New trick driving in these conditions.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.598
Now, don't panic.
But, I may have gone the wrong way.

05:13.638 --> 05:15.648
- Where are we going?
- I just try to find a place to turn.

05:15.674 --> 05:17.818
Look, don’t, don't worry.
It, it will be okay.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.538
Perhaps, the music to calm you down.

05:19.571 --> 05:20.747
No!

05:21.331 --> 05:24.028
Oh!
What is that?

05:25.972 --> 05:27.878
Oh, make it stop, Joe.

05:27.918 --> 05:29.142
Sorry.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.775
- I can't turn it off now.
- Oh!

05:32.176 --> 05:33.823
Oh, no.
What? Let's not...

05:33.856 --> 05:37.381
Shut up! Worry about the baby and me
then what about that after, Joe.

05:38.043 --> 05:40.423
Don't worry.
It'll be fine.

05:40.497 --> 05:41.727
It'll be okay.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.927
Turn off that rocket.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.310
- It certainly begins
- Come on, start.

05:44.336 --> 05:46.040
- Come on!!! Start!
- to disturb my sheeps.

05:46.067 --> 05:48.225
- Start!
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

05:48.264 --> 05:50.011
- It will be OK.
- Oh, dear.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.240
- We better get you inside.
- Breathe.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.214
- Ow! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- That's it.

05:54.268 --> 05:56.223
- You'll be OK. You'll be OK.
- Oh, hhhh!!!!

05:56.650 --> 05:57.963
Breathe, Maria.

05:57.997 --> 05:59.695
Take deep breath.
That's it.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.651
- You can do it. You can do it!
- Oh, hhhh!!!!

06:01.691 --> 06:03.158
Towel, please.

06:04.513 --> 06:07.173
- Have you done this before?
- Oh, yes.

06:07.495 --> 06:09.223
For cows, right now.

06:21.738 --> 06:24.225
We did it.
We did it!

06:25.461 --> 06:28.021
I mean, you... did it.

06:28.742 --> 06:30.069
Trust, I say.

06:30.903 --> 06:33.603
Our first baby,
on Christmas morning.

06:34.349 --> 06:35.969
She's beautiful.

06:37.835 --> 06:39.443
Noelle.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.308
You want to see your Daddy?

06:45.908 --> 06:48.002
Do you?
Yes?

06:55.788 --> 06:57.336
Are we Noelle?

06:58.282 --> 07:00.109
Are we miracle?

07:02.365 --> 07:03.592
Oh?

07:04.115 --> 07:05.195
Oh.

07:06.195 --> 07:07.448
Oh!

07:21.779 --> 07:22.859
Ah!

07:22.913 --> 07:24.229
Shou!
Excuse me!

07:24.255 --> 07:25.702
- Oh!
- Don't you get in my way.

07:25.742 --> 07:27.431
You hear what I'm saying to you?

07:27.571 --> 07:29.587
Look at you without your fancy jewelry.

07:29.627 --> 07:31.877
Look at that.
Do you hear what I'm saying...?

07:34.911 --> 07:36.852
- After you.
- Thank you.

07:43.001 --> 07:44.856
One tree was twenty five.

07:44.903 --> 07:47.429
Look!
Have you met my daughter?

07:47.732 --> 07:50.492
My life won't be worth living...

07:50.532 --> 07:52.159
if I go home without it.

07:52.251 --> 07:53.948
Give me!

07:54.604 --> 07:56.268
You know what, Mervyn?

07:56.894 --> 07:58.227
It's all yours.

07:59.954 --> 08:01.654
Happy Christmas.

08:17.269 --> 08:19.645
No fight, please.

08:27.095 --> 08:28.908
Shh!!!

08:45.372 --> 08:48.179
Imagine, you actually live in the castle?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.775
I think no-one lives there.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.733
Dad said that man who owns it...

08:53.009 --> 08:54.872
stays in America.

08:55.425 --> 08:57.086
Swell for some.

08:57.192 --> 08:58.519
Spud-Bob?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.973
Do you ever feel different?

09:01.216 --> 09:02.415
Seriously?

09:02.509 --> 09:04.956
You're asking me if I feel different?

09:05.096 --> 09:06.776
I mean, inside.

09:07.252 --> 09:09.145
Yeah.
I guess so.

09:09.225 --> 09:11.138
Especially, when my Daddy died.

09:11.824 --> 09:14.624
I kind of felt that I had to be there
for my Mommy, somehow.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.690
Why?
Do you feel different?

09:18.336 --> 09:19.557
Maybe, everyone does.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.693
- I...
- Noelle!

09:22.026 --> 09:24.199
Let's go get your Daddy!
It's time for lunch.

09:24.246 --> 09:26.646
OK, Mom.
In fact, I'm on my way.

09:26.926 --> 09:28.232
Spud-Bob.

09:28.319 --> 09:30.279
You're my best pal.

09:30.679 --> 09:32.339
See you, Noelle.

09:42.107 --> 09:43.303
What are you doing?

09:43.367 --> 09:45.320
It's this way.
This way!

09:45.380 --> 09:47.440
Not that way.
This way!

09:49.388 --> 09:50.681
These people.

09:50.887 --> 09:52.001
Noelle?

09:52.067 --> 09:53.848
Vieni dentro Ora!
(Come on now!)

09:55.042 --> 09:57.529
Scusa! Scusa!
(Sorry! Sorry!)

10:06.903 --> 10:08.983
Uh, Mr. Shepard?

10:09.579 --> 10:10.766
Yes, it's me.

10:10.847 --> 10:12.760
Are you there yet, McKerrod?

10:13.343 --> 10:15.136
Yes, sir.
We flew in last night.

10:15.163 --> 10:17.216
It was actually a lovely flight.

10:17.245 --> 10:19.724
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I'm not interested how you got there.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.725
If I want a conversation,
I'd talk to someone interesting.

10:22.785 --> 10:25.232
Just tell me what's going on
with the plan.

10:25.556 --> 10:28.363
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, we are right on schedule.

10:28.402 --> 10:32.148
And the surveyors are
measuring up as we speak, sir.

10:32.192 --> 10:33.221
Good, good, good.

10:33.255 --> 10:34.948
Are you sure they'll sell?

10:35.161 --> 10:38.568
Once I have spoke to them, sir,
I guarantee that you will sell.

10:38.614 --> 10:39.921
Yes, yes, sir.

10:40.047 --> 10:41.063
Good.

10:41.104 --> 10:42.391
I'm glad to hear that.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.717
Because this is your big idea, McKerrod.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.690
Which I am financing.

10:46.911 --> 10:49.351
So, just don't go
say anything stupid.

10:49.761 --> 10:52.960
Which, in your case, means,
don't say anything at all.

10:56.093 --> 10:57.139
Okay.

10:57.185 --> 10:59.566
That's enough.
I need a rest.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.293
Well done, Miss Burney.

11:01.423 --> 11:02.869
It's tough to be me.

11:03.128 --> 11:04.388
Whew!

11:09.578 --> 11:11.007
Come on, Junior!

11:11.127 --> 11:12.921
Stop admiring the scenery!

11:12.980 --> 11:16.628
There's no point getting used to it
because it'll all be gone soon.

11:17.162 --> 11:18.755
Come on.

11:31.116 --> 11:32.162
To Mervyn.

11:32.189 --> 11:33.416
- Mervyn.
- Mervyn.

11:33.483 --> 11:34.883
- Speech.
- Speech.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.343
Speech!

11:37.438 --> 11:38.526
Mervyn,...

11:38.588 --> 11:40.594
you know,
we are all going to miss you.

11:41.334 --> 11:46.377
Potters... Pottersglen Pottery
is a 500 year-old tradition.

11:46.524 --> 11:49.924
And you are a big part
of that tradition.

11:50.152 --> 11:53.274
You can take a man
from Pottersglen, but...

11:53.486 --> 11:56.819
you can't take Pottersglen
out of a man!

11:56.846 --> 11:58.873
- To Mervyn.
- To Mervyn!

12:00.726 --> 12:02.556
Whisky... Neat.

12:10.836 --> 12:12.056
Thank you.

12:16.476 --> 12:20.030
Still an upstanding member
of the community, O'Hanlon.

12:24.741 --> 12:26.860
What is he doing back?

12:26.981 --> 12:28.904
It's gonna be trouble, seriously.

12:43.067 --> 12:46.830
Two, one, six, eight.
Who do we appreciate?

12:46.981 --> 12:49.533
Go Snowballers!

12:49.587 --> 12:51.840
Stop!
Just let me sing!

12:55.749 --> 12:57.296
Go back to Noelle.

12:58.118 --> 13:00.191
- Ow!
- Foul! Wickman!

13:00.295 --> 13:02.422
Come on, now.
It was such her fault!

13:02.482 --> 13:04.402
If you're going to move on me, O'Hanlon,

13:04.462 --> 13:06.208
try to catch me.

13:06.372 --> 13:08.899
- Ah!
- That's it. Both of you, off!

13:09.032 --> 13:10.619
Get over there.

13:10.726 --> 13:12.352
Oh, come on.

13:12.502 --> 13:14.769
You better watch it, O'Hanlon.

13:17.757 --> 13:19.843
It's OK, Noelle.
We can still do it.

13:19.897 --> 13:22.051
Doubt it.
We've just lost our captain.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.569
Don't worry, Thomas.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.956
If we change formation,
we may still win.

13:27.034 --> 13:29.588
- Coach is going to kill me.
- Not if I get you first!

13:29.621 --> 13:31.794
Girls! Girls!
What's going on here?

13:31.849 --> 13:34.229
- She thinks she's so special.
- Both of you fouled.

13:34.283 --> 13:35.602
- Me?
- Now, calm down.

13:35.655 --> 13:37.715
- Did you not see that ...?
- Girl, girl!

13:39.362 --> 13:41.782
Noelle?
Is your ankle okay?

13:44.385 --> 13:45.388
All right.

13:45.413 --> 13:47.201
As soon as you two
straight your differences,

13:47.235 --> 13:48.635
you can come back on the pitch.

13:48.682 --> 13:49.809
All right?

13:49.895 --> 13:52.595
Two minutes left.
Everyone to play for.

13:53.089 --> 13:54.892
- How did you do that?
- What?

13:54.952 --> 13:58.948
That! Make everyone, I don't know,
calm down or something.

13:59.274 --> 14:01.986
- Like you got magic powers.
- Nah.

14:16.144 --> 14:17.455
Silence.

14:18.628 --> 14:20.495
I need silence.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.854
And breathe.

14:26.613 --> 14:28.400
Why are we here?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.741
I want to create magic.

14:32.427 --> 14:37.421
I want to touch the hearts of everyone
who walks into this auditorium.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.137
We are not going to act.

14:40.928 --> 14:43.521
We are going to be.

14:45.169 --> 14:46.377
Now.

14:46.410 --> 14:49.746
Who can tell me what this
Nativity play of ours is all about?

14:49.771 --> 14:50.613
Yes.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.100
Christmas Star, Miss Darcy,
and Jesus' birthday.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.384
My birthday is Christmas.

14:55.464 --> 14:57.020
- Hmm.
- Yes.

14:57.088 --> 15:00.884
But, he came down from Heaven,
was born under the Christmas Star,

15:00.971 --> 15:03.911
- got to perform miracles.
- Thank you, Bernadette.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.858
He wore sandals.

15:07.389 --> 15:08.769
I have sandals.

15:08.934 --> 15:11.127
Well, it's not about the sandles, darling.

15:11.626 --> 15:14.693
It's about the feet
that tread the boards.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.224
Ah! Ha ha ha ha.

15:17.755 --> 15:19.421
Noelle can do miracles.

15:19.449 --> 15:22.101
- Who? Miracles?
- Yes, thank you. I'm sure she can.

15:22.159 --> 15:23.632
Quiet!
Children, please.

15:23.685 --> 15:25.415
- Miss?
- Certainly, I think one likes...

15:25.441 --> 15:27.221
I would like to be ready
for this Christmas.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.488
Children, keep your voice...
Put that away.

15:29.552 --> 15:30.926
Down... Down here.

15:30.992 --> 15:32.175
- Children!
- Miss...

15:32.229 --> 15:34.636
- Miss Darcy!
- Quiet!

15:37.542 --> 15:38.942
- Hah.
- Sorry, Miss.

15:38.977 --> 15:40.350
There it is again.

15:40.550 --> 15:41.650
You did that.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.453
You can work miracles.

15:43.513 --> 15:45.113
Look, I don't know Spud-Bob.

15:45.267 --> 15:48.014
Miracles are like
walking on water and stuff.

15:48.237 --> 15:49.517
Let's try it.

15:49.677 --> 15:50.910
Come over to my house.

15:52.047 --> 15:55.120
It hurts my toes when
I play football in sandles.

15:59.146 --> 16:00.306
Okay.

16:00.339 --> 16:03.046
Let's try to multiply fish and bread bowl.

16:10.107 --> 16:11.307
Don't give up.

16:11.421 --> 16:13.120
How about the classic?

16:13.167 --> 16:14.740
Water into wine.

16:20.787 --> 16:22.714
No...
No use.

16:25.421 --> 16:27.348
One last one to try.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.528
Walk on water.

16:30.810 --> 16:32.697
No thanks, Spud-Bob.

16:33.044 --> 16:35.384
I don't understand why it's not working.

16:35.454 --> 16:39.367
Have you always been able to do it,
like since you were born?

16:39.864 --> 16:41.190
I don't know.

16:41.224 --> 16:43.240
I've never really thought
about it before.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.857
<i>They say,
out of difficulties groom miracles.</i>

16:47.084 --> 16:49.916
<i>Well, if that's true,
I must be lood enough a lot.</i>

16:50.323 --> 16:53.677
<i>Try working here for a week
and see if you don't need a miracle.</i>

16:54.546 --> 16:57.538
<i>Now, we're going to continue
with the Christmas Crooners.</i>

16:57.625 --> 17:02.149
<i>So, do bear with us and
stay tune to Pottersglen FM.</i>

17:02.517 --> 17:04.050
Sorry.

17:04.377 --> 17:06.384
We've not gotten
any decoration this year?

17:06.813 --> 17:09.633
Our money is tight, this time.
Factory is not doing too well.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.086
Oh, would you look at the mess in here!

17:12.239 --> 17:13.833
Come on, a hop up.

17:14.108 --> 17:17.502
How come I have to wear
a stupid dress in Nativity play?

17:17.569 --> 17:21.082
Because you're an angel.
And they don't tempt wearing hoodies.

17:21.698 --> 17:23.712
Why is my birthday on Christmas day?

17:23.806 --> 17:25.768
Because you were born
on December twenty-fifth.

17:25.788 --> 17:27.968
- Like Jesus?
- Ah, don't push your luck,

17:27.994 --> 17:29.808
You are an angel, already.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.319
I have always said,
you were Heaven sent, Captain.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.923
But, I was born in the stable, wasn't I?

17:35.977 --> 17:37.836
More a barn than a stable.

17:38.626 --> 17:40.907
- Can we go over there?
- Yeah, sure.

17:41.083 --> 17:44.456
Sit, stay still, please.
I don't want to stab you with these pins.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.141
- Can we go now?
- Oh, not now, love.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.534
It's late and I still have
decoration to finish.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.776
There... Just stay still.
Up, up, up.

17:54.514 --> 17:58.434
And we... are done.

17:58.537 --> 18:01.691
Great.
I'll get this thing off then.

18:04.647 --> 18:06.200
Sorry.

18:07.267 --> 18:09.947
Right, I'll get the car key.

18:15.618 --> 18:16.781
Here we go.

18:16.849 --> 18:18.355
Hope Angela's in.

18:19.295 --> 18:21.169
Yep, it looks like it.

18:27.747 --> 18:28.781
Joe!

18:28.881 --> 18:31.441
Maria!
How lovely to see you!

18:31.490 --> 18:33.451
So unannounced.

18:33.651 --> 18:35.431
It's lovely to see you again.

18:35.468 --> 18:37.482
- Yeah, we just wanted to show...
- Noelle.

18:37.656 --> 18:39.663
All grown up!

18:40.464 --> 18:45.344
The last time I saw you,
you weed all over your father.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.152
Come on in.
Out here is cold.

18:48.319 --> 18:50.172
I've the stove on.

18:50.975 --> 18:52.607
Here's tea wet.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.207
Thanks, Angela.

18:54.353 --> 18:55.487
Thanks.

18:55.570 --> 18:58.476
Hey, look. We, uh, we brought you
early Christmas present to you.

18:58.582 --> 19:00.335
You shouldn't have.

19:02.263 --> 19:03.823
Should we go to the barn, Noelle?

19:03.884 --> 19:05.063
Aye.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.933
You two can stay as you are.

19:06.993 --> 19:09.439
Make yourself at home.
Put your feet up.

19:10.570 --> 19:12.190
Not there!

19:22.500 --> 19:25.067
So, this...
this's where I was born.

19:25.503 --> 19:27.330
Probably not the first choice.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.870
But it makes a good story,
doesn't it?

19:38.862 --> 19:40.550
You see that star?

19:41.842 --> 19:43.029
That one?

19:43.203 --> 19:45.076
No, that's Orion's belt.

19:46.801 --> 19:47.894
That one?

19:48.007 --> 19:50.461
No, that's the North Star.

19:51.002 --> 19:52.188
Um...

19:53.035 --> 19:54.589
That one?

19:54.965 --> 19:57.692
No dear.
That's a plane.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.366
That one.

19:59.607 --> 20:00.919
The brightest star.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.707
That's the Christmas star.

20:04.445 --> 20:07.344
Some say...
it's the miracle star.

20:07.577 --> 20:08.910
Miracles?

20:09.825 --> 20:12.179
If you believe in miracles.

20:14.527 --> 20:16.728
Can I tell you something?

20:17.274 --> 20:20.441
It's going to sound
kind of crazy.

20:21.630 --> 20:23.318
But sometimes,...

20:24.349 --> 20:27.523
I think that I can do miracles.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.930
Sort of small ones, though.

20:32.236 --> 20:33.977
The night that you were born,...

20:34.791 --> 20:36.739
I wasn't supposed to be here.

20:37.512 --> 20:39.632
But I couldn't get this thing started.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.360
Based on the night it was,...

20:43.277 --> 20:45.777
your parents were lucky
to get up the mountain.

20:46.703 --> 20:49.276
I never delivered the baby before.

20:49.905 --> 20:51.772
Calves, yes.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.759
Hundreds of them.

20:54.979 --> 20:56.439
When you think about it,...

20:57.207 --> 20:59.087
that was a miracle.

20:59.784 --> 21:02.250
You...
were a miracle.

21:02.894 --> 21:05.740
But, does that mean
I can do miracles?

21:05.840 --> 21:08.123
- Do you love your family?
- Yes, of course.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.390
Well,...

21:09.497 --> 21:11.364
"Love" is a miracle.

21:11.917 --> 21:14.830
It's the most powerful miracle, in fact.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.327
- It is?
- Yes.

21:18.183 --> 21:21.223
Love can make bad things good.

21:21.982 --> 21:25.182
Love can bring people together.

21:25.766 --> 21:27.265
And I can use it?

21:27.559 --> 21:29.899
As a miracle, I mean?

21:30.141 --> 21:34.108
You're capable of doing
great things, Noelle.

21:34.438 --> 21:36.404
You always have been.

21:37.705 --> 21:39.318
Now, come on.

21:39.405 --> 21:42.491
Before your father ruins
half my furniture.

21:46.194 --> 21:49.569
Do you think...
the Star gets lonely?

21:50.151 --> 21:51.677
Up there?

21:52.537 --> 21:54.167
All on its own?

21:56.120 --> 21:59.227
Maybe, it wasn't always on its own.

22:08.722 --> 22:11.796
<i>There is bingo and bridge
bonanza on Thursday.</i>

22:11.976 --> 22:15.036
<i>And just when you thought
it couldn't get any more exciting,...</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:19.988
<i>Don't forget the Pottersglen's
school Nativity is on tomorrow.</i>

22:20.214 --> 22:22.096
<i>They tell me the tickets
have been selling well.</i>

22:22.143 --> 22:23.410
<i>So don't delay.</i>

22:24.122 --> 22:25.962
<i>Buy today.</i>

22:26.692 --> 22:29.645
<i>Until then, keep listening
to Pottersglen FM,...</i>

22:29.955 --> 22:33.802
<i>Where we got another
Christmas classics coming right up.</i>

22:53.379 --> 22:55.295
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

22:58.969 --> 23:00.622
- I love you.
- I love you too.

23:00.682 --> 23:01.889
Head touch.

23:03.213 --> 23:04.740
Now, get yourself tucked in.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.466
Dad?

23:07.939 --> 23:09.472
Do you think I'm special?

23:09.912 --> 23:10.965
Of course, I do.

23:11.311 --> 23:13.744
- It's in your genes.
- Do you think I was sent from heaven?

23:13.807 --> 23:15.108
I thought you were.

23:15.461 --> 23:19.481
So do you think I can do...
you know, um...

23:20.328 --> 23:21.635
miracles?

23:21.987 --> 23:24.680
Well, if you ever went to bed
when we asked you,

23:24.774 --> 23:25.793
that would be a miracle.

23:25.913 --> 23:28.597
No, Dad.
I mean, real ones.

23:29.999 --> 23:31.412
Yes, Captain.

23:32.138 --> 23:33.666
I do.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.793
Good night.

23:52.627 --> 23:54.660
Look at yonder star.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.981
It is so bright.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.641
And high.

24:01.468 --> 24:02.939
But ark.

24:05.192 --> 24:06.624
But ark.

24:07.526 --> 24:08.766
But hark!

24:08.846 --> 24:11.406
But hark, I hear an angel sings.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.656
I have a message for you,
Mary.

24:19.577 --> 24:21.249
I'm Babel.

24:26.018 --> 24:28.327
Can I do my song now?

24:37.635 --> 24:39.201
I...

24:47.824 --> 24:50.681
- I really enjoyed that.
- You were fantastic.

24:50.824 --> 24:54.233
- Everyone laughed at me.
- Not everyone, love.

24:54.287 --> 24:55.787
Look, Daddy was asleep.

24:55.997 --> 24:59.184
Your daddy got a lot on his mind
with the factory, darling.

24:59.257 --> 25:01.511
And anyway,
he only fell asleep at the start.

25:01.871 --> 25:04.932
Yeah, he woke up just in time
to see me fall over.

25:07.724 --> 25:09.137
- If we get though this.
- Oy!

25:13.620 --> 25:15.307
Mervyn, are you alright?

25:20.296 --> 25:21.323
Noelle?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.492
- Where is she, Joe?
- You were talking to her?

25:23.536 --> 25:24.716
You had her!

25:24.757 --> 25:25.806
- Noelle!
- Noelle!

25:25.839 --> 25:26.921
Noelle!

25:34.152 --> 25:35.318
Sorry.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.572
Sorry.

25:38.462 --> 25:39.588
- Noelle!
- Noelle!

25:39.628 --> 25:42.375
Noelle! What the heck are you doing?
You could have been killed.

25:42.563 --> 25:44.084
I mean, what were you thinking?

25:44.190 --> 25:46.883
- Play a chicken with a motorbike...
- Don't shout, Joe!

25:47.078 --> 25:49.658
You said I'm special, Daddy.
I can do miracles.

25:49.709 --> 25:52.328
- What?
- For family's sake, don't be ridiculous.

25:52.403 --> 25:54.496
Don't worry, darling.
Your dad just worried.

25:54.529 --> 25:57.592
Maria, she needs to learn that she can't
putting herself in danger like that.

25:57.632 --> 25:59.845
Now, no more talk
about miracles, you hear?

25:59.938 --> 26:01.671
Home! Now!

26:04.021 --> 26:05.218
Noelle, are you alright?

26:09.179 --> 26:10.346
Noelle?

26:10.679 --> 26:12.126
I'm not mad.

26:12.256 --> 26:15.222
It just...
You're so fearless, sometimes.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.229
Now, if anything happened...

26:19.670 --> 26:22.536
I think it's best if you just forget
this miracle stuff, okay?

26:26.126 --> 26:27.351
Captain.

26:28.299 --> 26:29.725
Head touch.

26:34.646 --> 26:36.535
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

26:52.900 --> 26:55.574
Well, maybe people just don't want
this kind of thing anymore.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.074
Then make them.

26:57.934 --> 27:01.074
Find a way to put
Pottersglen on the map.

27:02.396 --> 27:06.003
People aren't gonna wanna buy anything
if they don't know that you exist.

27:07.179 --> 27:08.799
What can I do?

27:10.739 --> 27:13.165
Joe, are you gonna lose your job?

27:15.775 --> 27:17.901
No one is being let go.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.321
What about Mervyn?

27:20.540 --> 27:23.626
If you lose your job,
we would have to move, wouldn't we?

27:23.772 --> 27:26.426
- I'm sure it won't come to that.
- Oh, you're sure, aren't you?

27:26.474 --> 27:28.195
Oh, well, that's very comforting.

27:28.229 --> 27:31.162
Like you were sure that you had
Noelle's hand at the Christmas market?

27:33.201 --> 27:34.481
Joe...

27:34.774 --> 27:37.594
Pottersglen is the factory.

27:37.751 --> 27:41.137
Without those snow globes,
the whole village will shut down.

27:44.313 --> 27:45.889
Let's just hope that your friend,

27:45.929 --> 27:48.452
the mayor,
has got some more creative ideas.

27:50.733 --> 27:52.779
- Just throw in here, Proinsias.
- Thank you.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.140
Everything alright?

27:54.333 --> 27:57.523
Well, that depends whether
you got good news or not.

28:00.305 --> 28:04.308
Well you know that bike destroyed
a lot of stock at the market.

28:04.948 --> 28:06.622
We're in trouble all right, Joe.

28:06.798 --> 28:08.278
But,...

28:08.491 --> 28:10.148
there is one option.

28:12.347 --> 28:14.287
Somebody made an offer on the factory.

28:14.895 --> 28:16.129
Who?

28:16.189 --> 28:17.797
You're not gonna like it.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.324
Noelle, what are you doing?

28:21.359 --> 28:24.119
Um... sleep... walking?

28:24.301 --> 28:26.717
Go ahead, get up the stairs now.
Go on. Up!

28:34.723 --> 28:37.357
No, it's just a bit of a shock,
I suppose.

28:37.503 --> 28:39.236
Thanks for coming, Proinsias.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.513
- Take care now.
- Be careful out there.

28:47.615 --> 28:48.811
Well?

28:49.009 --> 28:51.097
He says there's a barker.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.131
Who?

28:53.865 --> 28:55.504
Pat McKerrod.

28:55.707 --> 28:57.497
McKerrod?

28:58.709 --> 29:00.650
I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

29:00.710 --> 29:01.837
Yeah, well, he's back.

29:01.989 --> 29:03.448
I saw him the other night.

29:03.589 --> 29:04.764
What?

29:05.134 --> 29:07.144
Why didn't you tell me?

29:08.099 --> 29:09.373
Joe?

29:09.547 --> 29:10.773
Well...

29:10.833 --> 29:12.653
You two...
You know...

29:13.079 --> 29:14.508
Oh... Joe.

29:14.549 --> 29:16.582
Don't be ridiculous.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.519
He looks richer.
If that is possible.

29:19.930 --> 29:24.163
If I had wanted to marry a rich man,
would I marry you?

29:24.646 --> 29:25.749
Yeah, well...

29:25.849 --> 29:29.432
If he's the only option,
I think we really do need a miracle.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.689
Coach is trying to concentrate.

29:45.748 --> 29:46.822
Oy!

29:46.915 --> 29:48.355
I'm a good singer.

29:48.428 --> 29:49.563
You wait.

29:49.656 --> 29:51.743
- I'll show you.
- Who's that?

29:52.204 --> 29:54.257
Maybe, it's a mafia.

29:54.353 --> 29:55.436
I doubt it.

29:55.596 --> 29:57.700
What would the mafia
be doing in Pottersglen?

29:57.767 --> 29:59.323
Stealing my homework.

29:59.457 --> 30:02.397
Good luck to anyone
stealing your homework.

30:06.456 --> 30:10.016
- It won't start.
- You mind if I have a go, coach?

30:13.513 --> 30:15.806
I'm sure I recognize that bike.

30:20.675 --> 30:22.509
Pat McKerrod?

30:22.799 --> 30:24.292
Do you know him, coach?

30:24.412 --> 30:25.753
Who is it?

30:27.927 --> 30:29.707
Okay, here we go then.

30:36.613 --> 30:37.727
Oy!

30:46.822 --> 30:48.516
I can't believe it's come to this.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.305
- Calm yourself, Joe.
- Yeah, but McKerrod?

30:52.772 --> 30:55.132
I hope we haven't kept you, Proinsias?

30:55.334 --> 30:56.594
It's all right, Pat.

30:57.487 --> 30:58.828
O'Hanlon.

30:59.061 --> 31:01.188
Good to see you standing to attention.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.990
Which is more than you could manage
the last time we met.

31:09.235 --> 31:14.165
<i>That was the cliché with
"Everything Comes to Those Who Wait".</i>

31:14.545 --> 31:17.828
<i>It obviously never comes
to my house on Christmas Day.</i>

31:20.153 --> 31:23.027
Here's where the magic happens.

31:23.136 --> 31:26.486
Would you like to have a gold glazing
the snow globe interior?

31:26.879 --> 31:30.286
Oh here, let me Junior.
This is the delicate...

31:30.878 --> 31:32.032
process.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.840
- Hmm, it must be a faulty batch.
- I'll give him a faulty bat.

31:35.983 --> 31:38.870
Not to worry.
Let's move on, shall we?

31:40.047 --> 31:41.674
Pottersglen Pottery...

31:41.779 --> 31:46.671
kindly given to the Pottersglen community
by Maeve and Vincent McKerrod.

31:46.797 --> 31:50.417
Yes, we McKerrods are generous bunch.

31:50.707 --> 31:54.024
Okay, shall we get down
to some business?

31:56.157 --> 31:58.685
Um, not you, Junior.

31:58.852 --> 32:00.105
This is men's work.

32:00.176 --> 32:03.682
So, why don't you just stay down here
and try not to break anything.

32:03.736 --> 32:04.869
Okay?

32:40.744 --> 32:41.944
Come on, Noelle.

32:42.107 --> 32:44.347
- We're getting hammered here.
- I'm sorry

32:44.816 --> 32:46.142
What is it?

32:46.202 --> 32:48.129
It's just that man from the castle.

32:48.395 --> 32:50.495
There's something really funny about him.

32:50.555 --> 32:51.591
Sure.

32:51.651 --> 32:52.911
He lives in a castle...

32:52.998 --> 32:55.411
has suits that cost
more than this village...

32:55.631 --> 32:57.501
- And his skin is orange.
- No, I mean...

32:57.574 --> 32:59.768
I think I've heard his name before.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.113
My mom and dad were talking about him.

33:02.336 --> 33:03.635
Let's talk about it later.

33:03.729 --> 33:05.496
Right now, we need to win this game.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.317
Ooh!
I didn't see that one coming.

33:08.749 --> 33:10.642
- So, that's done, Mick.
- Yeah.

33:10.695 --> 33:13.042
- I can't believe it has come to this.
- Yeah... Yep.

33:13.122 --> 33:14.962
I suppose,
we have no other choice then.

33:15.186 --> 33:16.969
Anybody but McKerrod.

33:17.756 --> 33:20.376
Listen, O'Hanlon... Joe.

33:20.969 --> 33:23.003
No hard feelings, okay?

33:23.070 --> 33:26.317
As far as I'm concerned,
this is all water under the bridge.

33:26.367 --> 33:28.527
You knew full well
what you were doing.

33:28.799 --> 33:29.913
Well, what can I say?

33:29.940 --> 33:32.286
I was young and
Maria was a beautiful woman.

33:32.330 --> 33:33.936
I was talking about the factory.

33:33.987 --> 33:34.997
Oh, that.

33:35.037 --> 33:37.257
Well, I guess I used
to be a little clumsy.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.303
Clumsy?

33:38.330 --> 33:41.583
Well, smashing the entire production line
of snow globes clumsy?

33:41.637 --> 33:44.330
knocking over of the oldest machines
was that clumsy?

33:44.356 --> 33:47.385
- No, it was an accident.
- Yes, an accident that happened

33:47.410 --> 33:49.899
just after your parents
threatened to change their will.

33:49.932 --> 33:51.645
Yes, well, they didn't, did they?

33:51.713 --> 33:53.687
Everything all right here, gentlemen?

33:54.440 --> 33:56.274
- Fine.
- Fine.

33:56.672 --> 33:58.146
Junior.

34:02.761 --> 34:05.147
Oh, how is Maria, by the way?

34:05.248 --> 34:07.118
Calm yourself, Joe.

34:08.384 --> 34:10.750
- We need this.
- From him?

34:11.010 --> 34:12.190
There is nobody else.

34:17.281 --> 34:19.134
Mr. O'Hanlon?

34:19.241 --> 34:20.516
Yes.

34:21.139 --> 34:22.270
Junior, isn't it?

34:22.342 --> 34:24.243
Um, Mr. O'Hanlon...

34:24.337 --> 34:26.940
My dad, he doesn't always act so nice.

34:26.993 --> 34:28.987
But, he is.
Really.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.047
- Did he send you over?
- No... No.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.956
It's just that
he's been working very hard.

34:35.409 --> 34:38.655
And since my mom left,
he hasn't been the same.

34:38.734 --> 34:40.415
You don't need any excuses.

34:40.472 --> 34:42.599
We all have problems.
I understand.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.083
I just hate for you to get
the wrong impression of him.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.177
That's all.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.524
Best be getting back.
Your dad's been waiting.

34:48.847 --> 34:50.603
Goodbye, Mr. O'Hanlon.

34:56.739 --> 34:58.069
Well...

34:58.190 --> 34:59.470
Did he buy it?

34:59.530 --> 35:01.257
I think so, Dad.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.544
You are learning.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.493
Slowly.

35:15.453 --> 35:17.526
Come on, Noelle.
We'll be off soon.

35:17.613 --> 35:19.259
I don't think I like that man.

35:19.636 --> 35:20.759
Which man?

35:20.836 --> 35:23.289
The one with fake tan and a suit.
You know, McKerrod.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.942
Noelle, don't be rude.

35:25.529 --> 35:26.830
There's something about him.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.238
You don't like him either.

35:28.357 --> 35:31.967
Listen, that man might be the only hope
we have to save the factory.

35:32.014 --> 35:33.413
Okay, he's not that bad.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.853
Now, come on.

35:35.353 --> 35:36.547
Joe, you got the keys, love?

35:36.601 --> 35:38.388
Of course, I got the keys.

35:44.190 --> 35:47.126
Oh, keys, keys, keys, keys.

35:52.932 --> 35:53.949
We won't be long.

35:53.979 --> 35:55.414
So you can play
in the yard with your mates.

35:55.439 --> 35:56.245
Okay.

35:56.272 --> 35:58.259
- Hey, Spud-Bob.
- Hi, Noelle.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.380
Ah...

35:59.414 --> 36:00.654
Ladies...

36:00.714 --> 36:02.054
Gentlemen...

36:02.107 --> 36:03.700
Potters.

36:03.924 --> 36:07.784
They say the best speeches
start with, uh, a little joke.

36:07.870 --> 36:09.310
So...

36:10.294 --> 36:12.140
I ask you...

36:13.544 --> 36:17.387
how much does a potter actually earn?

36:21.444 --> 36:22.718
What is he saying?

36:22.758 --> 36:24.899
I think he's just making a bad joke.

36:24.946 --> 36:26.372
That settles for him.

36:26.406 --> 36:28.507
Never take anything seriously.

36:36.116 --> 36:39.976
As you know, Pottersglen Pottery
is in a bit of trouble.

36:40.304 --> 36:44.457
Demand for our Nativity snow globes
has almost died out.

36:44.687 --> 36:47.233
But, all is not lost.

36:47.426 --> 36:50.327
We have a potential buyer.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.500
And he's here to say a few words.

36:52.562 --> 36:54.312
Some of you may remember him.

36:54.425 --> 36:55.958
Pat McKerrod.

36:56.399 --> 36:58.258
- Pat McKerrod?
- Boo!

36:58.318 --> 37:01.474
Are you helping a liar.
after what he did to our factory?

37:01.501 --> 37:02.575
I do nothing.

37:02.635 --> 37:04.195
Been best of Greeting!

37:04.299 --> 37:05.346
Everyone.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.594
Now, now, please.
Please, calm down.

37:08.622 --> 37:11.002
- Get off.
- You let me explain?

37:11.037 --> 37:12.143
Get out of here.

37:12.184 --> 37:13.603
What is wrong with these people?

37:13.660 --> 37:16.186
Let's go back home.
Got enough of this.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.692
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

37:18.726 --> 37:20.290
- That's a good start.
- Hhh.

37:20.377 --> 37:21.636
Let's give him a chance.

37:21.683 --> 37:23.523
- Oh!
- No, no!

37:23.878 --> 37:25.340
Oh, my dad's speaking.

37:26.443 --> 37:28.263
Doesn't look like it's going well.

37:28.323 --> 37:29.703
A long time ago,...

37:29.736 --> 37:32.680
I'm sure how was McKerrod family always
been good to us in the past.

37:32.727 --> 37:34.207
Not this McKerrod.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.396
The best thing he ever did
for this place was to leave.

37:37.437 --> 37:39.236
Yes!

37:39.275 --> 37:42.361
Every man deserves
a second chance, don't they?

37:42.409 --> 37:43.749
No, Joe!

37:46.483 --> 37:49.106
Does everyone deserves a second chance?

37:54.417 --> 37:56.857
- I too agree with it.
- Yes, yes.

37:58.915 --> 38:00.402
This is why we're all here.

38:00.618 --> 38:03.365
To try to save the Pottersglen.

38:06.530 --> 38:08.344
Thank you, Joe.

38:09.065 --> 38:11.925
I was born... here.

38:12.265 --> 38:14.638
My father was born here.

38:14.958 --> 38:18.030
I grew up round here.

38:18.307 --> 38:23.708
These glens are just as much
a part of me as my own son.

38:24.155 --> 38:26.288
My one true heir.

38:26.485 --> 38:30.365
Everybody, this is Junior.
Say hello, Junior.

38:30.555 --> 38:32.575
Junior, say hello.

38:33.457 --> 38:34.763
Hi.

38:35.003 --> 38:37.216
Thank you, Junior.

38:37.469 --> 38:43.722
Now, I want Junior here to grow up
to love this village, just as much as I do.

38:43.936 --> 38:45.983
So, let me assure you all...

38:46.043 --> 38:48.470
that under our ownership,...

38:48.522 --> 38:51.715
everyone will be
guaranteed a job for life.

38:51.817 --> 38:53.397
- Is that right?
- Yes.

38:53.473 --> 38:54.901
And not only that,...

38:54.951 --> 38:56.731
those of you who...

38:57.303 --> 38:59.111
agree with our terms,...

38:59.277 --> 39:01.237
will receive a check...

39:01.731 --> 39:05.567
- for 10,000 pounds.
- Yeah!

39:05.901 --> 39:08.928
A token of McKerrod goodwill.

39:14.345 --> 39:16.405
Smile!

39:16.518 --> 39:18.505
Smile for the pretty people.

39:18.542 --> 39:19.582
Thank you.

39:25.836 --> 39:26.996
Thank you.

39:29.836 --> 39:32.792
- Mick, all the best, all right?
- Goodbye, Mick.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.686
Maria Monelli.

39:35.754 --> 39:37.600
Maria O'Hanlon now.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.521
Yes, of course.

39:39.735 --> 39:43.055
You do not look a day older
than you were at eighteen.

39:43.102 --> 39:45.661
- Noelle, I like you to meet...
- Mr. McKerrod.

39:45.708 --> 39:47.421
Please, call me Pat.

39:48.030 --> 39:49.576
Pleased to meet you, Noelle.

39:49.697 --> 39:51.964
What a festive name!

39:52.170 --> 39:53.676
If you excuse me.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.110
Maria.

39:57.310 --> 39:59.217
You want to play ball with us?

39:59.437 --> 40:00.871
I don't know.

40:01.952 --> 40:03.792
I don't play soccer.

40:03.905 --> 40:05.358
Just American football.

40:05.406 --> 40:06.826
Well, it's pretty similar.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.959
You just use your feet and
don't get any helmets.

40:10.349 --> 40:13.863
So you kids play all the time?

40:13.956 --> 40:16.412
- Pretty much.
- Oh, Junior!

40:19.995 --> 40:22.158
You really need to grow up.

40:22.265 --> 40:24.085
Fraternizing with the locals?

40:24.186 --> 40:25.575
Football?

40:25.973 --> 40:27.548
Man up.

40:37.591 --> 40:39.571
Mr. Shepherd?

40:39.757 --> 40:42.077
Why do you always ask
if it's me, McKerrod?

40:42.126 --> 40:44.379
My name comes up
on your phone, you idiot!

40:44.426 --> 40:46.932
- Uh, well, uh...
- No, no, no, don't talk. Just...

40:47.239 --> 40:48.619
tell me how it went.

40:48.695 --> 40:50.690
Yes, it went very well.

40:50.723 --> 40:54.236
And I think we'll have their full consent
by the end of the week.

40:54.296 --> 40:56.643
Good.
I'm glad to hear that.

40:56.876 --> 40:59.192
I always said you'd go far, McKerrod.

40:59.393 --> 41:00.639
Glad you did.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.219
Thank you.

41:02.322 --> 41:04.576
Give me a bit of peace and quiet.

41:05.009 --> 41:06.055
Oh!

41:06.106 --> 41:08.252
Just make sure...

41:08.459 --> 41:10.852
you get them to sign, okay?

41:11.354 --> 41:14.801
Much just I like sending you away,
it costs me money.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.397
Yes, sir.

41:16.844 --> 41:18.397
And one more thing.

41:20.016 --> 41:22.596
Are they still making those snow globes?

41:22.646 --> 41:25.146
Do not worry about
the snow globes, sir.

41:25.206 --> 41:28.073
Soon, there will be no snow globe.

41:28.213 --> 41:29.738
Ugly little things.

41:29.872 --> 41:31.432
I like them.

41:31.571 --> 41:36.018
Oh, oh, well, I guess
we could always make them in China?

41:36.508 --> 41:40.480
Look,... just do your one job
and get those signatures.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.573
I wanna be under way by the new year.
Do you understand?

41:43.639 --> 41:45.413
Don't let me down, McKerrod.

41:45.499 --> 41:46.724
Capisce?

41:46.818 --> 41:48.165
Yes, sir.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.544
Idiot.

41:51.381 --> 41:53.535
Oh...
Yes, sir.

41:55.433 --> 41:58.146
He is proud of your dad.

41:58.223 --> 41:59.783
I'm sure he is.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.227
Ah.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.327
Oh-Urgh!

42:03.388 --> 42:05.421
Pottersglen Potteries.

42:05.501 --> 42:07.857
Place should have been flatten years ago.

42:09.135 --> 42:14.442
Imagine when this all makes way
for McKerrod's Christmas kingdom.

42:14.968 --> 42:18.784
Casino, hotel, golf course.

42:19.239 --> 42:20.846
But, Dad?

42:21.059 --> 42:23.932
Why do you hate Pottersglen so much?

42:24.775 --> 42:27.682
There are two types of people
in this world, Junior.

42:28.143 --> 42:29.823
And I hate both of them both.

42:30.635 --> 42:32.462
Get in.

42:33.157 --> 42:35.251
The other car.

42:37.121 --> 42:39.081
Get in.
Now!

42:49.868 --> 42:51.688
The bike from the market?

42:53.664 --> 42:55.770
- You remember that film?
- What film?

42:55.795 --> 42:58.151
You know, the one with all
the pastries and the calendars.

42:58.178 --> 42:59.264
No.

42:59.308 --> 43:02.324
I think we're gonna need
considerably bigger buns.

43:03.518 --> 43:05.778
What did I ever see in you?

43:05.903 --> 43:08.010
More than you saw in Pat McKerrod.

43:08.478 --> 43:11.945
You don't look a day older
than when you were 18.

43:13.441 --> 43:15.181
Uh,... Dad?

43:15.273 --> 43:18.287
I overheard Mr. McKerrod
and his son talking.

43:18.395 --> 43:20.321
What had I told you about eavesdropping?

43:20.425 --> 43:22.851
Please, don't let them sell
the factory, Dad.

43:22.945 --> 43:24.808
There's something about them.

43:25.139 --> 43:26.992
And that man on the motorbike.

43:27.513 --> 43:28.846
Noelle.

43:29.445 --> 43:30.805
It's okay.

43:31.253 --> 43:32.753
Everyone liked them.

43:32.955 --> 43:35.108
Well, after I stepped up.

43:35.335 --> 43:36.888
- You should have seen it...
- No.

43:37.102 --> 43:39.976
No, you don't understand.
I made them listen.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.732
Oh, yeah?
How did you do that?

43:41.780 --> 43:43.653
I used my miracle power.

43:44.447 --> 43:46.654
Noelle, what had I told you?

43:46.967 --> 43:49.207
There's no such thing as miracles.

43:49.608 --> 43:51.715
Now, he's not my favorite person either.

43:51.845 --> 43:53.132
But, we need him.

43:53.348 --> 43:55.115
So just stay out of it, okay?

43:55.236 --> 43:57.959
Why don't I just
stay out of everything then?

43:59.014 --> 44:00.874
Don't be silly, Noelle.

44:00.961 --> 44:02.352
Smart, Joe.

44:02.479 --> 44:04.100
Real smart.

44:10.685 --> 44:12.239
Boo!

44:13.801 --> 44:15.467
Come on, love.

44:15.541 --> 44:17.028
Come here.

44:20.322 --> 44:22.502
You know, your daddy didn't mean it.

44:23.050 --> 44:25.723
He's under a lot of pressure at work.

44:25.874 --> 44:29.280
He's always under
a lot of pressure nowadays.

44:30.151 --> 44:32.964
What is it with him and
Mr. McKerrod, anyway?

44:33.147 --> 44:34.333
Well...

44:34.627 --> 44:38.394
He asked me to marry him
before your daddy did, though.

44:38.468 --> 44:40.922
- Mr. McKerrod?
- Yes.

44:41.829 --> 44:44.222
- The really rich guy?
- Yes.

44:44.495 --> 44:47.902
The one with all the cars,
who lives in the castle?

44:48.258 --> 44:50.167
Yeah, right.
Turn my wound.

44:51.857 --> 44:55.684
Well, that's... that's kind of why
they don't exactly see eye to eye.

44:55.774 --> 44:57.440
And now he's buying the factory?

44:57.527 --> 45:00.460
- No, he, he's saving the factory.
- No, he's not.

45:00.639 --> 45:02.765
He's changing all of it.

45:03.013 --> 45:05.239
Sometimes, we need change, Noelle.

45:05.480 --> 45:08.729
Maybe, he's exactly
what Pottersglen needs.

45:09.395 --> 45:11.667
Come on.
Get to sleep, okay?

45:12.640 --> 45:17.393
Ah, and don't you worry.
Everything is gonna be fine.

45:17.732 --> 45:19.912
- Night-night.
- Goodnight.

45:31.970 --> 45:34.929
I overheard him said really nasty things.

45:34.962 --> 45:36.676
I'm sure he's up to no good.

45:36.756 --> 45:38.489
But, my dad is so happy.

45:38.546 --> 45:42.859
He said that that Mr. McKerrod
is the reason we don't have to move away.

45:43.078 --> 45:44.665
What could we do, anyway?

45:44.773 --> 45:47.159
Why don't you do that thing
you did, Noelle?

45:47.262 --> 45:49.789
You know,
use your miracle power.

45:49.956 --> 45:52.456
Miracles don't exist, Spud-Bob.

45:52.535 --> 45:53.715
They do.

45:53.777 --> 45:56.154
- How did you know?
- Because I've seen them.

45:56.387 --> 45:57.514
I believe.

45:57.561 --> 46:00.368
Remember all the times
she made our teachers being nice.

46:00.495 --> 46:02.161
I believe in miracles.

46:02.302 --> 46:03.788
It's worth to try.

46:03.902 --> 46:05.890
I don't think we should.

46:06.158 --> 46:07.690
Let's give her a chance.

46:07.744 --> 46:08.991
Yeah, come on!

46:09.064 --> 46:10.325
Okay.

46:11.236 --> 46:13.529
All I need is to catch his attention...

46:13.589 --> 46:15.515
and look him in the eye.

46:16.161 --> 46:18.281
How do we get his attention?

46:21.162 --> 46:23.438
Football straight to the head.

46:23.603 --> 46:24.903
Perfect.

46:25.903 --> 46:28.366
Well, look, who it is?

46:32.536 --> 46:34.143
How's that of timing?

46:36.906 --> 46:38.399
Perfect.

46:39.205 --> 46:41.406
Then your out-building
will be built along there.

46:41.491 --> 46:44.394
Which will provide access
of the main drag.

46:44.571 --> 46:46.472
Parking along here.

46:46.899 --> 46:48.119
Um...

46:48.300 --> 46:51.313
We could go either way on that.
I'm not sure which.

46:51.453 --> 46:53.839
Yes, moving forwards.

46:54.073 --> 46:55.399
Um, you can see...

46:55.432 --> 46:57.479
- Dad?
- how my factory improving scheme...

46:57.527 --> 46:59.134
- Dad, Dad?
- will let the economy...

46:59.187 --> 47:00.814
- of this entire area.
- Dad!

47:00.846 --> 47:01.926
- See...
- Dad.

47:02.006 --> 47:03.532
Excuse me a moment.

47:03.603 --> 47:04.830
What?

47:05.122 --> 47:08.115
I can play..., I mean,
talk to those kids over there?

47:08.157 --> 47:11.443
You are not going play football, Junior.

47:11.484 --> 47:13.297
Use your head.

47:14.182 --> 47:15.502
Who was that?

47:15.635 --> 47:16.928
Answer me!

47:17.088 --> 47:18.667
You little...

47:23.466 --> 47:25.772
Little... scam.

47:27.013 --> 47:29.006
- Now, ahem...
- Get off kids!

47:29.043 --> 47:31.342
- Anyway...
- My miracle power didn't work.

47:32.024 --> 47:33.091
I told you.

47:33.146 --> 47:34.906
There's no such things as miracles.

47:34.953 --> 47:36.006
I'm going.

47:36.046 --> 47:37.606
I shouldn't have never listened to you.

47:37.674 --> 47:40.121
This is what happens
when you break the rules.

47:40.257 --> 47:42.090
Okay, go if you want.

47:42.724 --> 47:44.290
Some day,
you'll know the truth.

47:44.441 --> 47:46.200
Then you'll be sorry.

47:48.714 --> 47:50.081
Spud-Bob?

47:50.281 --> 47:51.734
Sorry Noelle.

47:51.807 --> 47:54.770
My mom is making sausages
and rolls of spaghetti groups.

48:06.314 --> 48:09.654
Welcome everyone
to this very special day.

48:09.735 --> 48:15.602
The signing of the new ownership
agreement of Pottersglen Pottery.

48:18.287 --> 48:22.432
It is with a touch of sadness
of the village community for sale.

48:22.492 --> 48:25.109
However, it feels right...

48:25.282 --> 48:28.475
that it goes back
to the McKerrod family.

48:32.747 --> 48:34.390
Messing around again.

48:34.517 --> 48:36.091
- Are we?
-  I know,...

48:36.116 --> 48:37.630
- Thank you, everyone.
- you and your dad are up to no good.

48:37.664 --> 48:39.137
- I heard you talking.
- Myself and Junior,...

48:39.170 --> 48:41.726
I know about the golf course
and the hotel.

48:41.807 --> 48:44.354
And you want us
to make the globes in China.

48:44.399 --> 48:45.606
Junior?

48:45.679 --> 48:48.116
Got to go.
Important business.

48:51.294 --> 48:53.836
Both my son and I will be leaving soon

48:53.882 --> 48:57.678
to announce our Pottersglen plans
at Stormont.

48:57.803 --> 49:00.910
Both UTV and the BBC will be there.

49:00.954 --> 49:03.613
So you'll all get to witness my...

49:03.661 --> 49:08.396
I mean, our big moment live on television.

49:09.259 --> 49:11.912
<i>There has been a fire
in the furnace room.</i>

49:12.098 --> 49:16.424
<i>Please, just form an orderly queue
and exit the building.</i>

49:17.250 --> 49:19.591
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

49:19.700 --> 49:22.501
Please, leave immediately by the X exits.

49:22.604 --> 49:25.197
- Noelle, what are you doing?
- Trying to save the factory.

49:25.266 --> 49:26.819
I told you to leave this alone.

49:26.892 --> 49:28.815
<i>I'm trying to stop that weird man, Daddy.</i>

49:28.848 --> 49:32.771
He's a fake:
The hair, the teeth, and fake tan.

49:33.154 --> 49:35.630
Just so you know,
this is not fake.

49:35.690 --> 49:37.930
It's pure Californian sunshine.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.716
<i>He wants to make a hotel here
just for Christmas.</i>

49:40.819 --> 49:43.830
<i>And for us all
to make the globes in China.</i>

49:44.069 --> 49:46.771
The little girl's obviously confused.

49:46.815 --> 49:48.315
She means porcelain.

49:48.389 --> 49:50.842
Who would make
the snow globes out of China?

49:51.083 --> 49:53.629
Stop!
You're gonna ruin this for everyone!

49:53.669 --> 49:55.456
We're trying to save
Pottersglen here.

49:55.496 --> 49:56.757
But, you're not.

49:56.957 --> 50:00.587
I'm not to try to cause
any trouble, Daddy, honestly.

50:00.809 --> 50:03.366
My miracles just won't work anymore.

50:03.404 --> 50:05.257
Miracles?
That is enough!

50:05.299 --> 50:07.319
Noelle,
you're in so much trouble.

50:07.352 --> 50:09.598
Now, you can stay up here
while we finish this.

50:09.678 --> 50:11.622
And I'll deal with you later.

50:17.461 --> 50:20.244
Of the imagination of children.

50:22.588 --> 50:24.104
Well, that was...

50:24.308 --> 50:25.528
alarming.

50:27.705 --> 50:28.958
Thank you.

50:37.357 --> 50:38.597
Thank you, everybody.

50:38.644 --> 50:41.250
If you would like to come up
and sign your agreements,

50:41.283 --> 50:43.817
then Proinsias can give you your checks.

50:43.986 --> 50:45.380
Thank you.

50:48.088 --> 50:49.937
Chips fall in block, O'Hanlon.

50:50.304 --> 50:52.157
Don't push it, Pat.

50:56.113 --> 50:57.227
Come on.

51:01.135 --> 51:04.789
How did that little brat
even come close?

51:04.819 --> 51:06.985
China?...
China?

51:07.372 --> 51:09.079
- Was that you?
- No!

51:09.656 --> 51:12.583
O'Hanlon has been the bane of my life.

51:12.646 --> 51:16.512
So, I am not going to let some little
upstart to spoil things for us now.

51:16.553 --> 51:20.939
So, you go and you find her
and you shut her up.

51:23.241 --> 51:24.597
Oh, Junior?

51:24.671 --> 51:25.938
Yeah, Dad?

51:26.080 --> 51:28.479
Try not to disappoint me.

51:29.939 --> 51:31.393
Man up.

51:41.638 --> 51:43.091
I never got to sing.

51:45.090 --> 51:47.374
- I really thought...
- Noelle?

51:47.444 --> 51:48.904
Hey, Noelle.

51:49.470 --> 51:52.037
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am your friend.

51:52.092 --> 51:53.546
Well, then where were you?

51:53.866 --> 51:55.446
I needed your help.

51:56.020 --> 51:57.716
Don't any of you believe me?

51:59.398 --> 52:02.138
None of you are my friends.

52:05.529 --> 52:07.070
Hey!

52:08.616 --> 52:11.503
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

52:11.705 --> 52:13.180
Hey.

52:13.393 --> 52:14.754
Leave him alone.

52:14.907 --> 52:16.346
Look at you.

52:16.393 --> 52:17.993
You're so pathetic.

52:18.053 --> 52:19.913
At least, we know how to have fun.

52:19.967 --> 52:21.893
You know how to have fun, all right?

52:22.107 --> 52:24.733
My daddy and me,
we own this place.

52:24.790 --> 52:28.103
We can do whatever we want.

52:28.317 --> 52:30.424
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

52:30.640 --> 52:33.106
Like knocking down everything...

52:33.235 --> 52:36.342
and making the McKerrod Christmas Kingdom.

52:36.449 --> 52:38.171
That's what.

52:41.810 --> 52:43.177
Get in!

52:53.066 --> 52:54.309
Noelle!

52:54.376 --> 52:55.696
Noelle!

52:59.256 --> 53:00.477
Where are you?

53:00.603 --> 53:01.710
Maria?

53:01.764 --> 53:03.677
Maria, have you seen Noelle?

53:03.856 --> 53:05.889
What?
Oh, Joe, not again.

53:05.929 --> 53:07.055
I can't find her anywhere.

53:07.103 --> 53:08.736
Maybe, she has gone home on a sulk.

53:08.777 --> 53:10.823
Let's go.
Quick.

53:18.190 --> 53:19.879
What are you kids up to?

53:20.490 --> 53:21.811
Where's Noelle?

53:21.850 --> 53:23.933
I think she went up the mountain, coach.

53:23.966 --> 53:25.039
On her own?

53:25.079 --> 53:27.447
It's dangerous up there.
Those paths aren't safe.

53:27.488 --> 53:29.241
Oh, no.

53:35.121 --> 53:36.601
Hey, there!

53:36.954 --> 53:39.498
Look,...
don't be frighten.

53:39.771 --> 53:41.498
Want a ride?

53:41.979 --> 53:43.272
Look, Noelle.

53:43.346 --> 53:45.939
We're gonna offer your dad
a big promotion.

53:45.986 --> 53:48.942
Think about how happy
your mom and dad are gonna be.

53:49.519 --> 53:50.575
Hey!

53:50.609 --> 53:53.296
we even give your team
new soccer gear.

53:54.423 --> 53:56.610
It's football.

53:57.341 --> 53:58.922
Noelle!

53:59.334 --> 54:00.468
Noelle?

54:00.647 --> 54:01.927
Noelle?

54:02.443 --> 54:03.710
Are you up there?

54:03.743 --> 54:05.063
Noelle!

54:05.092 --> 54:06.152
- Noelle!
- Noelle!

54:06.185 --> 54:07.592
Sweetheart!

54:08.651 --> 54:10.211
Where is she, Joe?

54:10.538 --> 54:12.128
What about the marina?

54:13.909 --> 54:15.677
I know what you're up to.

54:15.723 --> 54:17.563
I know you want to close the factory.

54:17.602 --> 54:19.488
So, why does no one believe you?

54:19.544 --> 54:21.504
Your friends don't believe you.

54:21.560 --> 54:25.433
And more importantly,
Why does your daddy not believe you?

54:25.634 --> 54:27.948
Does he not love you?

54:28.121 --> 54:29.948
You don't even know what love is!

54:29.980 --> 54:31.440
My daddy does love me!

54:31.480 --> 54:33.968
At least, he doesn't tell me to man up.

54:34.068 --> 54:35.648
Maybe, you should, though.

54:35.781 --> 54:38.042
You don't know
what it's like to be me.

54:38.292 --> 54:39.911
You can have fun all the time,

54:39.949 --> 54:43.196
and you don't have to think
about anybody but yourself.

54:45.792 --> 54:46.968
It was you...

54:47.160 --> 54:48.447
at the market?

54:48.730 --> 54:50.104
Who are you?

54:50.783 --> 54:52.583
Who needs to man up now?

54:52.624 --> 54:53.978
I'm not scared of you.

54:54.025 --> 54:55.511
What about these guys?

54:55.692 --> 54:56.886
Get her!

54:57.659 --> 55:01.885
Get your maggoty friends
off of my mountain.

55:01.950 --> 55:05.563
Or I'll show you maggots the beatings
that'll make you wish you've never seen.

55:05.623 --> 55:08.282
Get out!
Out of here, you all.

55:09.879 --> 55:12.372
You should see me
first thing in the morning.

55:12.686 --> 55:14.606
Thank you so much.

55:15.126 --> 55:16.679
I was coming to see you.

55:16.873 --> 55:19.153
I didn't think
you were here for the sheep.

55:21.218 --> 55:23.206
We all should have believed her.

55:23.637 --> 55:27.816
Well, you know,
Noelle's kind of... special.

55:27.867 --> 55:30.040
And most of all,
she is our friend.

55:30.067 --> 55:31.680
And we have to stick together.

55:31.705 --> 55:33.099
We're the Snowballers!

55:33.124 --> 55:34.403
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

55:34.573 --> 55:36.714
But, we didn't stick together.

55:37.374 --> 55:39.754
She is my best friend.
And...

55:39.944 --> 55:41.605
I let her down.

55:42.287 --> 55:44.214
We all let her down.

55:44.827 --> 55:47.627
Now, it's time to take matters
into our own hands.

55:47.679 --> 55:49.959
Just like Noelle wanted us to.

55:50.246 --> 55:53.220
Well, we could tell everyone
what McKerrod son just said.

55:53.300 --> 55:54.633
They won't believe us.

55:54.695 --> 55:56.390
We need solid proof.

55:57.243 --> 55:58.838
I've got an idea.

55:59.185 --> 56:01.185
I've got a cold.

56:06.465 --> 56:09.605
Maybe, I never have miracle powers.

56:09.895 --> 56:11.609
Maybe my dad was right.

56:11.799 --> 56:13.912
That was all in my head.

56:14.299 --> 56:17.292
Oh, I hate the man
and his stupid son.

56:17.449 --> 56:18.629
Which man?

56:18.692 --> 56:21.778
The one with leathery skin
and fake smile.

56:21.819 --> 56:24.206
You know, McKerrod?
I hate him.

56:24.254 --> 56:25.666
Hate?

56:25.974 --> 56:30.282
Did you ever think that
maybe why it's not working?

56:30.660 --> 56:33.660
Love is the miracle.
Not hate.

56:34.001 --> 56:36.268
But they hate me,
and they've won.

56:36.308 --> 56:39.360
No one believes me.
They all signed those papers.

56:40.282 --> 56:44.495
My friends think I'm crazy,
and my dad's really mad at me.

56:44.952 --> 56:46.873
We all lost.

56:47.155 --> 56:50.549
It's only lost if you give up.

56:59.652 --> 57:01.145
Well...

57:02.359 --> 57:03.972
Are you going to give up?

57:04.036 --> 57:05.788
Let the hatred win?

57:06.451 --> 57:08.624
You're the captain, Noelle.

57:10.036 --> 57:11.750
What you're gonna do?

57:11.983 --> 57:14.557
Win or lose?

57:16.719 --> 57:18.320
Win.

57:18.574 --> 57:20.174
Good.

57:20.774 --> 57:24.054
Now, we have to find the way
to get you down the mountain.

57:24.756 --> 57:26.377
Coach!

57:41.123 --> 57:43.110
Bubble, this way!

57:58.446 --> 58:00.092
You took your time.

58:00.166 --> 58:02.552
- All good?
- Yeah, all good.

58:03.154 --> 58:06.176
Then,... clean yourself up.

58:06.246 --> 58:08.952
You look a mess.
You look like one of the locals.

58:08.999 --> 58:13.282
I can't have you ruining my image
in front of the cameras.

58:14.331 --> 58:17.621
Dad, this is all the right thing to do?

58:18.161 --> 58:19.341
Hhh!

58:19.394 --> 58:21.068
Let me tell you something.

58:21.155 --> 58:23.329
I grew up around here.

58:23.517 --> 58:29.191
The sea, these hills, the pottery,
it's in my veins.

58:29.501 --> 58:32.140
This village means the world to me.

58:32.667 --> 58:34.621
- Really?
- Of course not.

58:34.668 --> 58:37.676
This place stinks.
And I can't wait to bulldoze it.

58:38.177 --> 58:39.777
Now, get in.

58:44.594 --> 58:47.447
Hurry up.
We need to be at Stormont by 4:00.

58:58.087 --> 59:00.039
How do we actually get in?

59:00.236 --> 59:01.582
Is the door locked?

59:02.182 --> 59:03.409
Of course, they are locked.

59:03.450 --> 59:05.343
I don't think we should be breaking in.

59:05.389 --> 59:06.882
We should go back.

59:07.055 --> 59:09.375
Before we get into trouble.

59:09.416 --> 59:10.722
- Give me your hairpin.
- Ouch!

59:10.762 --> 59:12.391
- It works in movies.
- Give that back.

59:12.416 --> 59:13.618
Right.

59:19.496 --> 59:21.743
Oh,...
that was easy.

59:24.926 --> 59:26.392
How did she do that?

59:26.786 --> 59:27.912
Bubble?

59:27.966 --> 59:29.552
In we go, I guess.

59:36.491 --> 59:38.065
Whoa!

59:38.331 --> 59:40.151
This is so fancy.

59:40.258 --> 59:41.958
Is he royal?

59:42.250 --> 59:44.410
He's royal or something all right.

59:45.291 --> 59:46.750
Here we go.

59:53.532 --> 59:55.245
Noelle!

59:55.552 --> 59:56.845
Noelle!

59:57.585 --> 59:59.348
Where's she gone, Joe?

59:59.683 --> 01:00:01.256
It's okay.
We'll find her.

01:00:01.329 --> 01:00:03.543
It's not okay.
She's missing.

01:00:03.655 --> 01:00:04.941
She can't be gone far.

01:00:04.974 --> 01:00:06.670
Look, are you sure
you checked the factory?

01:00:06.695 --> 01:00:08.903
- Yes, I checked.
- Well, check again.

01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:11.775
I'll go home,
in case she comes back.

01:00:12.121 --> 01:00:13.388
We'll find her.

01:00:13.603 --> 01:00:14.832
I promise.

01:00:22.204 --> 01:00:23.913
Hurry up, O'Brain.

01:00:24.457 --> 01:00:25.787
Got this.

01:00:26.241 --> 01:00:27.860
Huh!
No way!

01:00:27.894 --> 01:00:29.640
That will wipe out the whole village.

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:30.946
He tricked everyone.

01:00:30.971 --> 01:00:33.330
We can't let him get away with this.

01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:34.987
Noelle was right.

01:00:35.028 --> 01:00:36.234
Yes, she was.

01:00:36.274 --> 01:00:37.734
And I didn't believe her.

01:00:38.033 --> 01:00:40.180
Right.
No time for pity party.

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:41.770
What are we going to do?

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.990
We should take this laptop as evidence,

01:00:45.023 --> 01:00:47.223
find coach, and
get him to take us to Belfast,

01:00:47.256 --> 01:00:50.570
so we can show the government
McKerrod's plans before it's too late.

01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:53.045
What?

01:00:55.028 --> 01:00:57.141
What are you kids doing here?

01:00:58.062 --> 01:00:59.430
Get back here!

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:01.348
Hurry up!

01:01:02.074 --> 01:01:03.381
Come on.
Hurry.

01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:05.583
Faster!
Come on, faster!

01:01:08.677 --> 01:01:10.417
Come back here!

01:01:10.544 --> 01:01:12.884
- Now!
- Stop!

01:01:14.016 --> 01:01:15.416
Come back here!

01:01:15.524 --> 01:01:18.207
Stop now or I'll kill you all.

01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:28.561
Oy, oy, oy!

01:01:28.608 --> 01:01:30.427
Oy!
Move it!

01:01:33.217 --> 01:01:34.997
Quick.
Come on, come on here.

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:38.243
You didn't expect me
to miss all the fun, did you?

01:01:38.356 --> 01:01:39.783
I owe you an apology.

01:01:40.023 --> 01:01:41.703
I've been a rotten friend.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.287
Me too.

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.803
Sorry, Noelle.

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:46.403
No time for apologizing now.

01:01:46.456 --> 01:01:47.856
We got to get to Stormont.
Come on.

01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:50.845
All right, come on.
We need to get going. Come on.

01:01:51.393 --> 01:01:53.015
Have you told your parents?

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.401
Stormont?
I can't believe this.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:00.414
Mick, you've seen Noelle around?

01:02:00.668 --> 01:02:02.613
Sure, she was in the little bus...

01:02:02.666 --> 01:02:05.006
with all her little school pals
and a teacher of theirs.

01:02:05.046 --> 01:02:06.320
Where was she going?

01:02:06.419 --> 01:02:09.040
I think they said... Stormont.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.390
Stormont?

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.089
For the love of...

01:02:14.203 --> 01:02:18.736
We will hear now from Mr. Pat McKerrod
about the Pottersglen development.

01:02:18.773 --> 01:02:22.613
An undertaking that will save
over 150 jobs.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.554
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

01:02:27.581 --> 01:02:30.980
It gives me a great pleasure
to announce...

01:02:34.196 --> 01:02:36.249
Stop! Stop!

01:02:36.929 --> 01:02:39.548
Look, we can both go together.
Can you get over here?

01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:43.924
<i>- I'll be right over and have a meeting.</i>
- Oh, no, she's done it now.

01:02:43.985 --> 01:02:45.612
<i>What's going on, Joe?</i>

01:02:45.818 --> 01:02:47.598
Just get yourself over here.
Now.

01:02:48.691 --> 01:02:50.337
This man is lying!

01:02:50.362 --> 01:02:52.271
His plans aren't
what he says they are.

01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:54.547
Nellie, come in here and see this.
Nellie, you're missing the treat.

01:02:54.574 --> 01:02:56.369
- What?
- These kids are really going for it.

01:02:56.394 --> 01:02:58.437
- In Stormont.
- I'm getting the tan on.

01:02:58.465 --> 01:03:00.741
Nellie! In Stormont!
It's on the TV.

01:03:01.485 --> 01:03:02.818
Over there.

01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:04.939
Show these children out.

01:03:04.975 --> 01:03:06.835
No, wait.
We have proof.

01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:09.315
- Why didn't you call me in sooner?
- Oh, you're stinking.

01:03:09.364 --> 01:03:12.038
<i>We remain live at Stormont,
where it seems the children...</i>

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.989
<i>There has been a disturbance here
at Stormont,</i>

01:03:15.019 --> 01:03:17.932
<i>where a group of children
barged in moments ago.</i>

01:03:18.105 --> 01:03:19.828
<i>They appear to have information...</i>

01:03:19.868 --> 01:03:22.911
<i>And just about to present finding
that there is some way related</i>

01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:26.458
<i>to ex local businessman, Pat McKerrod,
current development proposals.</i>

01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:28.334
<i>Accusations find...</i>

01:03:29.634 --> 01:03:32.881
This is his real plan for Pottersglen.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.104
This... It's... It's...
It's ludicrous.

01:03:35.137 --> 01:03:39.220
I've never seen this laptop
before in my life.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.360
Ever.

01:03:40.494 --> 01:03:42.154
Ever. Ever.

01:03:45.184 --> 01:03:48.896
<i>What is this I hear about
McKerrod's Christmas Kingdom?</i>

01:03:48.943 --> 01:03:50.389
Ah, Mr. Shepherd!

01:03:50.423 --> 01:03:53.499
- If you give just me a minute...
<i>- I wouldn't give a fuck your name.</i>

01:03:53.566 --> 01:03:57.779
<i>I said: develop the place,
not destroy it.</i>

01:03:57.859 --> 01:04:01.085
<i>But here's a new plan for you,
Mr. Mc.Idiot.</i>

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.358
- Mister...
<i>- You're fired.</i>

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.327
McIdiot?
I told him.

01:04:11.336 --> 01:04:12.863
How did she get there, Joe?

01:04:12.896 --> 01:04:14.503
Would you tell us
what's happening here?

01:04:14.529 --> 01:04:16.270
No! Enough!

01:04:17.255 --> 01:04:20.438
Why are you listening to these children?

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.919
I'm an adult.

01:04:21.953 --> 01:04:25.123
Listen to me,
not some silly little girl.

01:04:25.168 --> 01:04:26.957
I want to hear her speak.

01:04:28.142 --> 01:04:29.495
Um...

01:04:32.657 --> 01:04:35.644
Mr. McKerrod is not a bad man.

01:04:36.504 --> 01:04:38.965
He maybe just got a little...

01:04:39.203 --> 01:04:40.643
lost.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:43.536
He couldn't make snow globes himself.

01:04:43.707 --> 01:04:46.587
So, he smashed up
all the other ones people made.

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.938
I guess that he's still trying to do that.

01:04:50.005 --> 01:04:52.498
And this is one of the snow globes there?

01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:55.703
"Sotto la Stella,
e il miracola Dell amore."

01:04:55.744 --> 01:04:57.150
Well, what does that mean?

01:04:57.274 --> 01:05:00.526
Under the stars is the miracle of love.

01:05:01.188 --> 01:05:02.615
I thought...

01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:05.508
that because I was born
on Christmas Day,...

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:07.918
Under the Christmas Star,...

01:05:08.312 --> 01:05:10.913
<i>I thought that I had a gift.</i>

01:05:11.358 --> 01:05:14.298
<i>But it turns out that
everyone has that gift.</i>

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.525
My friends,...

01:05:16.986 --> 01:05:18.653
<i>my mom and dad,...</i>

01:05:19.814 --> 01:05:21.468
all of us.

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:24.831
<i>It's the gift of love.</i>

01:05:25.264 --> 01:05:28.920
<i>And it's the most powerful gift of all.</i>

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.915
Oh,... please,
give me a break.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:40.682
No, give me a sick bag.

01:05:40.743 --> 01:05:43.796
Because I feel physically sick.

01:05:43.904 --> 01:05:46.304
Now, now, you can see why
I want to flatten this place.

01:05:46.398 --> 01:05:47.765
Unbelievable.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.613
Do you know who I am?

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:54.823
Barry, there's someone here
who doesn't know who he is, leg.

01:05:55.438 --> 01:05:56.834
- You... here...
- No...

01:05:56.868 --> 01:05:58.895
Get your hands off me!

01:05:59.002 --> 01:06:00.428
I...

01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:05.661
You're all forgetting one little detail.

01:06:06.034 --> 01:06:09.107
I own Pottersglen's Pottery.

01:06:09.233 --> 01:06:12.347
I own Pottersglen's Pottery.

01:06:12.394 --> 01:06:14.722
I own Pottersglen...

01:06:14.747 --> 01:06:17.739
- Oh!
- Actually Dad,... you don't.

01:06:17.844 --> 01:06:20.147
Junior,... give that back.

01:06:20.172 --> 01:06:22.120
While you were in the meeting
at the factory,

01:06:22.154 --> 01:06:24.487
I decided to have a look
at the property book.

01:06:24.662 --> 01:06:27.843
It turned out,
after you smashed up the place,

01:06:27.876 --> 01:06:30.242
Grandma and Grandpa put
a clause in the contract,

01:06:30.282 --> 01:06:32.705
saying you could never own
the Pottersglen Pottery,...

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:34.470
it means, I own it.

01:06:34.516 --> 01:06:35.890
Oh, really?

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:38.790
And I think it should go back
to the people it belonged to.

01:06:40.186 --> 01:06:42.072
Junior... Junior...

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:44.519
- Ju...
- Oh!

01:06:57.678 --> 01:07:00.907
<i>These are those dramatic scenes again
from Stormont this afternoon,</i>

01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:04.007
where a young girl saved
her village from demolition.

01:07:04.036 --> 01:07:05.582
Looks like I've manned up.

01:07:15.045 --> 01:07:17.299
Maybe I'm the one
who needs to man up.

01:07:17.402 --> 01:07:18.669
Junior.

01:07:32.228 --> 01:07:33.411
Oh, yeah.

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:35.582
We've not all won yet so folks.

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:38.501
We still have the problem
of what to do with the factory.

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:44.158
Pottersglen Pottery,
how may I help you?

01:07:44.215 --> 01:07:47.622
Yes, I like to order 10 boxes
of your snow globes, please.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.127
Of course.

01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:50.927
Can I take your name, please?

01:07:50.991 --> 01:07:52.344
Kylie Minogue.

01:07:52.398 --> 01:07:55.204
Ha ha.
I should be so lucky.

01:08:01.351 --> 01:08:03.284
Hello, Pottersglen Pottery.

01:08:03.357 --> 01:08:05.414
Oh, hi.
It's that Pottersglen Pottery?

01:08:05.454 --> 01:08:06.687
- Yes, sure.
- Yep. Excellent.

01:08:06.727 --> 01:08:08.649
Listen, I want to get
some of these snow globes.

01:08:08.674 --> 01:08:09.934
Five or six boxes should do it.

01:08:09.982 --> 01:08:11.908
Make a nice change from socks.

01:08:12.882 --> 01:08:14.435
You deliver?

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.227
Around the globe?

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.621
Yes, very funny.

01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:21.336
Uh, it's 25, wait for it, Tinsel Lane.

01:08:21.656 --> 01:08:24.416
yes, I know.
It's very Christmas Saint.

01:08:24.484 --> 01:08:26.332
That's what everyone says.

01:08:27.444 --> 01:08:29.591
Sure.
How many boxes?

01:08:32.392 --> 01:08:34.078
Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:41.461
Mom!
Dad!

01:08:41.515 --> 01:08:43.100
You never guess what.

01:08:43.435 --> 01:08:44.982
There she is.

01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:46.809
Oh, darling!

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:48.328
Oh!

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.952
What am I gonna do with you?

01:08:50.978 --> 01:08:52.198
- You have any idea...
- Sorry.

01:08:52.232 --> 01:08:54.011
how worried we've been?

01:08:59.259 --> 01:09:01.040
Noelle, honey.

01:09:01.193 --> 01:09:02.642
Wait til you hear this.

01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:07.667
It is with great pleasure that I invite
your daughter, Miss Noelle O'Hanlon...

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:11.415
to switch on the city's
Christmas lights this year.

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:16.620
We have been so inspired
by her brave actions...

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.019
Are you kidding me?

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.224
It's real, Captain.

01:09:19.258 --> 01:09:20.911
You deserve it.

01:09:21.884 --> 01:09:23.604
What about my friends?

01:09:24.099 --> 01:09:25.832
It says here,
they're invited too.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:27.487
Wait!

01:09:27.532 --> 01:09:29.848
Can I wear my football kit?

01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:33.278
Whatever you like.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:44.827
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

01:09:44.995 --> 01:09:48.068

01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:53.447

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.892
<i>In 25 years of broadcasting.</i>

01:09:59.546 --> 01:10:01.761
<i>Not even the one here in Pottersglen.</i>

01:10:01.835 --> 01:10:03.788
<i>Or my own house.</i>

01:10:04.689 --> 01:10:06.609
