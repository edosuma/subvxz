00:02.160 --> 00:03.360
Previously on The Shield.

00:03.560 --> 00:07.040
Mr. Esteana claims you used
excessive force during his arrest.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.600
Fourth complaint since I came.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.920
You don't like it,
take it up with Gilroy.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.760
In this building, I'm in charge.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.840
Maybe in your own mind, amigo, but
in the real world I don't answer to you.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.800
Not even on Cinco de Mayo.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.160
- What's your take on Mackey?
- I don't judge cops.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.920
Mackey's not a cop.
He's Al Capone with a badge.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.160
- I saw Mackey talking to this dealer...
- Named Rondell Robinson.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.560
You suggesting Mackey's working...

00:28.760 --> 00:32.040
...for a dealer?
- The dealer's working for Mackey.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.920
- Who's he?
- Moses Hernandez. He's in Justice.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.640
We' re talking about making a case that
puts Mack behind bars for a long time.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.160
- What are you getting out of this?
- A dirty cop off the street.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.080
It's all about trust,
otherwise you end up dead.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.920
Knock, knock, who's there?
Strike Team, Mr. Drug Dealer.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.760
Terry's losing his cherry tonight.
He's coming with us.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:13.280 --> 01:15.840
- 911, what is your emergency?
- I've got an officer down!

01:16.000 --> 01:19.120
- I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
- This is Detective Vic Mack ey.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.160
- I've got an officer down...
- You have an officer down?

01:22.320 --> 01:24.520
The goddamn police radio
in the van isn't working...

01:24.720 --> 01:28.840
- What is the condition of the officer?
- Condition? He's dying! We're...

01:29.000 --> 01:31.320
- I have the address.
- Where are we?

01:31.480 --> 01:33.160
- I don't know...
- Ambulance is en route.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.160
- I'm coming!
- Detective.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.960
Detective?

01:38.120 --> 01:41.720
He was about 10, 15 feet in front of me
and Shane when I hear this gunshot...

01:41.880 --> 01:43.480
...and I see Terry go down.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.960
Jesus.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.280
Shane and I turn around the corner.
We see the guy in this bathroom.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.320
He gets off a few rounds.
We hit back.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.880
We should kill the prick.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.680
Hey. He's a tough son of a bitch,
Terry, all right? He's gonna be okay.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.720
What happened?

02:10.600 --> 02:13.480
- Terry's down?
- Yeah.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.240
- How is he?
- Took a headshot.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.360
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.640
I didn't clear the room.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.640
I was point. First thing you do
is clear the room.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.440
Look, we both missed him, dude.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.240
At 1:29 a.m.,
Detective Terry Crowley...

02:49.400 --> 02:53.040
...was admitted for a single gunshot
wound to the face.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.840
Surgeons made...

02:56.520 --> 02:58.480
Made every attempt to resuscitate him.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.800
Shit.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.800
Ultimately, their attempts
were unsuccessful.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.800
Detective Crowley was pronounced
dead at 2: 13 this morning.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.720
No!

03:13.880 --> 03:15.560
Damn.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.840
I'm responsible.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.920
- I'm responsible.
- Responsible how?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.360
It was my operation.
I called the shots.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.480
What could you have
done differently?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.440
Terry asked me to move him up.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.160
- He was part of your team.
- He wasn't ready for this.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.480
Eight years on the force, a stint
in Robbery, two commendations.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.880
Sounds like he was ready.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.560
- Strike Team's different.
- Really?

04:03.200 --> 04:06.240
We knock down the doors
other cops don't want to.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.920
My guys accept the risks because
they know I will take care of them.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.080
We go out on a mission, I expect every
single one of them to come home.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.279
Anything else is unacceptable.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.640
- What's taking so long?
- They' re asking their questions.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.960
Yeah, well, how many questions
can they have?

04:25.120 --> 04:28.080
How would it look if IAD only
took five minutes to call this?

04:28.240 --> 04:31.200
- They have to be thorough.
- Aceveda's gonna shut us down.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.360
Look, Aceveda's a water boy.
He can't do dick.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.400
- Why is it taking them so long?
- Look. I answered your question.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.080
- No, no...
- All right.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.800
- Detective Vendrell.
- Yeah, that's me.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.960
Just tell them what happened.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.760
Yeah.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.120
Yeah, yeah.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.560
- What are you doing back here?
- Not our crime scene anymore.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.400
- IAD gave us a friendly shove.
- Why didn't you shove back?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.600
Asst. Chief Gilroy gave the order.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.840
- Gilroy? He's there?
- He was.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.360
I don't like spending five hours
collecting evidence for someone else.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.840
Are we on this case or aren't we?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.800
- David.
- Sir.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.080
Your office?

05:28.160 --> 05:31.200
Thanks for your good work
this morning, Claudette.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.520
Hasn't been wasted.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.640
No, just our time.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.800
Sir.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.640
Where the hell were you
last night?

05:42.800 --> 05:45.120
- What do you mean?
- Detective Crowley got shot.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.840
- I left you a message.
- Yeah, I got it.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.880
- So?
- So.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.640
- You didn't say I had to come down.
- I shouldn't have to.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.400
A fellow officer was dying
in that hospital.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.840
I said a prayer for him.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.880
A prayer?

06:02.440 --> 06:03.760
What?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.680
I've been on the job for three weeks.
I didn't know that guy.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.000
Rule number one:
He was a cop.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.280
That means you knew him.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.360
- Two deaths, two investigations.
- David, please.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.520
You can't have your cops
investigating your cops.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.600
If you clear the Strike Team,
that's gonna smack of favouritism.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.200
If you actually find something, you' re
gonna have a civil war on your hands.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.160
Let Internal Affairs do their job.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.280
Has anyone sent sympathies
to Crowley's family?

06:41.440 --> 06:43.280
I spoke to his mother
an hour ago.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.360
- Someone should speak at the funeral.
- Well, perhaps you...

06:46.560 --> 06:49.560
No. He was your man.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.200
I'm sure you'll represent us well.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.960
You were the first one Mackey brought
aboard when he assembled the team.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.360
We'd worked together.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.400
- So there was a comfort level.
- Yeah.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.840
- Same with the other guys?
- Vic knew them too.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.160
- Detective Crowley?
- No. He was recommended by someone.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.640
- I don't recall who.
- So Terry was an outsider.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.080
No. He was a new guy.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.440
But once Vic puts you on the team,
then you' re on the team.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.880
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.960
Strike Team's getting the third degree?

07:20.120 --> 07:21.640
Looks like it.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.080
You're assigned
the crime scene, right?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.000
We' re off it now.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.200
Guys are curious. I told them I'd
find out what's going on. Any idea?

07:30.360 --> 07:33.080
Looks to me like Vic and his
cowboys went in undermanned...

07:33.240 --> 07:36.960
...with a half-assed plan
and managed to get a guy killed.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.040
Then again, I'm off the case.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.240
Later, okay?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.840
Tell him this is L.A.,
not the Wild West.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
I'd know those fingernails anywhere.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.880
How you holding up?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.320
I lost a guy. I don't like it.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.920
- I saw you at the hospital last night.
- I saw you too.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.240
- You had a crowd. I didn't want to...
- It's all right.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.960
- I don't want you to think that what...
- I don't.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.160
Look, if you need a break from all this,
you wanna talk, come find me, okay?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.320
That's good to know.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.280
Anytime someone kills a cop...

08:26.440 --> 08:29.560
...scumbags get it into their heads
that it's open season.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.560
- Leads to rule number...?
- Three:

08:31.720 --> 08:34.600
Cop goes down, we re-establish
our dominance on the street.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.360
Someone mouths off,
they hit the pavement.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.320
Someone resists, we make sure they
make a pit stop at the emergency room.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.200
We gotta make sure these assholes
know who's in charge, right?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.640
Loud and clear.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.760
- What happened to your hand?
- I put it through a window.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.800
- Last night, during the raid?
- No, after I found out about Terry.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.760
- Is it all right?
- Yeah.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.920
Cut up pretty bad though, huh?
Any tendon damage?

09:02.080 --> 09:04.800
Can we just get this the hell
over with, please?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.960
Mackey sent Terry to that house
to get killed.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.360
- You don't know that.
- Please.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.040
Cops get killed in the line of duty.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.240
Did you tell anyone Terry was trying
to take down Mackey? Did you?

09:24.400 --> 09:26.960
- David...
- Because I didn't, and Terry's dead.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.280
- I followed protocol.
- Protocol.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.440
The things that Terry wanted, a job,
a car, I'm not authorized to sign off on.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.080
- You broke the circle.
- I sent his request up the ladder.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.440
- This is the Justice Department.
- So they can be trusted?

09:41.600 --> 09:43.640
- I've gotta go to IAD.
- Why?

09:43.840 --> 09:46.280
To let them know exactly why
Mackey wanted Terry dead.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.680
You can't do that.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.520
They' re gonna let him walk, Moses.
If they have motive, they'll dig deeper.

09:51.680 --> 09:56.040
David, you initiated an off-the-books
investigation into one of your own men.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.320
Now, you come forward,
your career's dead.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.840
We sent Terry to his own death.
What am I supposed to do?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.760
Well, what do you hope to accomplish?

10:04.280 --> 10:06.880
It won't prove that Vic set Terry up.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.520
You'll lose the power you've worked
your whole life to acquire.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.080
I'm not gonna let him get away
with it.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.880
There is an epitaph
for an unknown soldier that goes:

10:21.040 --> 10:25.760
Do not stand at my grave and weep
For I am not there, I do not sleep

10:25.920 --> 10:28.400
With my brothers in the field
I kneel

10:28.560 --> 10:33.000
Their lives, my merit
My death, their zeal

10:33.360 --> 10:38.280
I believe these words do express the
sentiments of Detective Terry Crowley.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.080
A good man
and an exemplary police officer...

10:41.240 --> 10:43.800
...who served his community
and his department...

10:43.960 --> 10:47.360
...with dignity, loyalty and courage.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.200
In the time that I was fortunate
to work with Terry...

10:52.360 --> 10:54.640
...I came to know him
as a man who embraced life...

10:54.920 --> 10:59.320
...adored his friends and family,
and loved being a cop.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.080
I am the resurrection and the life.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.680
He that believeth in me,
even though he were dead...

11:06.880 --> 11:08.640
...yet shall he live.
- Amen.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.920
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.960
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.160
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.480
We will miss his service
and his good nature.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.320
And I know I speak on behalf
of the entire force when I say:

11:24.520 --> 11:28.240
Terry, our lives are your merit...

11:28.400 --> 11:31.440
...and your memory gives us zeal.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.000
- He leadeth me beside the still waters.
- Yes.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.240
He restoreth my soul.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.960
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

11:40.120 --> 11:42.960
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.320
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.000
Fire!

11:51.000 --> 11:52.840
Fire!

11:56.560 --> 11:59.000
- Sorry...
- It's all right now. It's all right.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.080
- Sorry, baby! I'm sorry!
- It's okay. It'll be all right. Come on.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.080
- What are you doing?
- What?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.560
Save it for the car ride, Shane.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.160
What's the matter with you?

12:13.320 --> 12:16.640
- I just didn't expect to see his mother.
- Yeah. He had a mom. So what?

12:16.800 --> 12:20.840
- So, what did we do, Vic?
- Hey. What we had to.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.680
- Christ. Come on, man.
- Enough. Come on.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.400
- Cold, man.
- Look.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.960
We made him one of us
and what did he do?

12:29.120 --> 12:31.000
- What did he do?
- Turned rat.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.240
He tried to stick you and me both
in a cage with the same animals...

12:34.400 --> 12:37.920
...we fight every day.
Now, did I enjoy it? No.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.920
Did it need to be done?
You' re goddamn right it did.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.960
Now, Shane, listen to me.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.480
We' re gonna ride this out. Right?

12:49.480 --> 12:52.080
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.400
- Sir, step back.
- No, it's cool. I called you.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.920
- Step away, sir.
- I need to get the money he owes...

13:21.080 --> 13:22.840
Don't make me warn you again, sir.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.680
- He's gotta have my cash here.
- I'm not gonna warn you again.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.120
- I just need to get the money he owes.
- What'd she say?

13:34.320 --> 13:37.280
- I'm a Good Samaritan here!
- What were you doing to that body?

13:37.440 --> 13:39.200
Livan said he had
the 100 he owed me.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.080
I come here
and see somebody shot him.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.200
I went down the block and call for 911
and come back here to get my money.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.000
Jesus, Julien, this guy's still alive.
This is One Tango 13.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.880
- I need an R.A. To respond.
- Hey, Livan! Keep fighting, man.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.680
- I'll collect from you later!
- Let's go.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.520
Shane barely touched his pork chops.
I don't think he's doing well.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.240
- He's gonna be fine.
- He didn't seem fine.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.200
Hasn't even been a week yet.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.040
I'm coming, sweetie.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.960
It's like he blames himself
for the whole thing. It's not normal.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.360
I mean, it's not like he killed Terry.

14:27.400 --> 14:32.160
Here I am, baby.
Here's your bottle. It's okay.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.120
No, I'm sitting poolside
with this guy named Frank.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.280
- A transvestite?
- He's buying drinks.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.160
- That ugly-Iooking guy?
- The guy that I always hang out with.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.240
He's like 18 years old.
You gotta be joking me, man.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.880
Come on, you holding
out on me, Shane?

14:56.200 --> 14:59.080
I got fresh meat. This here's Terry.
Comes to us from Robbery.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.040
Robbery?
You mean like the fag squad, man?

15:03.560 --> 15:07.320
We ran out of fresh asses, so I figured
I'd try you prom queens on for size.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.600
Hey, if you' re looking for fresh asses,
I'd cross Shane off your list.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.680
Oh, stop it, mister.
Stop it.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.560
Looks like it's gonna be a blast
with you guys.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.160
- Just make sure you keep up.
- I'll try.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.400
Don't let these pussies
haze you too bad.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.720
Yeah, we love you pretty boys
from Robbery.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.920
- You know how to play pitch?
- You bring your wallet?

15:30.080 --> 15:33.800
Don't let them stick you with Shane
as a partner. He always loses.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.600
- Because you're a bunch of cheaters.
- And he's a crybaby.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.120
- Shut up, Shane.
- Don't trust one of these guys.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.640
You know what?
He's the worst player in here.

15:48.160 --> 15:53.560
Okay, Capt. Fiddly. Let's get
you ready for school. Come on.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.440
Body was over there. We found
one shell casing a few feet away.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.960
- How's the victim?
- Medic says, swirling down the drain.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.200
- Who said that? Randy?
- Yeah.

16:04.360 --> 16:09.120
- Sounds like Randy, cynical bastard.
- Does the rookie ever talk?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.840
Yeah, he talks.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.800
- What does this tell you?
- Ma'am?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.480
You' re our first eyes and ears
on the crime scene.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.640
What does this one tell you?

16:25.960 --> 16:29.840
Overturned cart, footprints,
clear sign of a struggle.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Actually, the struggle occurred
after we arrived.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.040
A guy was going through his pockets.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.800
After repeated requests to stop,
I pulled him off the body.

16:38.960 --> 16:43.280
Knocking over the churro cart and
getting sugar all over our crime scene?

16:43.640 --> 16:44.720
Yes, ma'am.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.640
Actually, it was my fault.
I should've...

16:46.800 --> 16:51.160
I hope this isn't the way you teach a
trainee how to preserve a crime scene.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.440
This is how murderers go free, son.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.040
Don't take it hard. She's in a pissy
mood because it's her birthday.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.240
Did we...?
Was this scheduled?

17:09.560 --> 17:13.160
No. Frances came by to give
me her preliminary report.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.960
I wanted you to get a sneak peek
at it too.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.359
We wrapped up the interviews.
I'll fast track ballistics...

17:19.560 --> 17:22.160
...and get you a final copy
in the next couple of weeks.

17:22.319 --> 17:26.560
Bottom line, it wasn't a model
operation, but it wasn't a crime either.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.640
Vic and his boys look okay
on this one.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.840
- Really?
- Drug dealer's girlfriend confirms...

17:32.040 --> 17:35.200
...the Strike Team's account. She puts
the gun that killed Crowley...

17:35.400 --> 17:38.760
...in the dealer's hands seconds
before the shooting.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.280
Thanks for the fast work, Frances.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.520
She must be good.
Two men killed, a dozen rounds fired...

17:50.680 --> 17:53.120
...no ballistics and she's
already making her call.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.120
It's a preliminary report, David.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.320
I just don't want to be accused
of whitewashing anything.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.880
Last thing this department needs
is to add to the Rodney KinglO.J. Book.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.280
I don't wanna be a chapter
in that book either.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.360
I'll make sure she doesn't
get lazy on this one, okay?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.800
That was a great eulogy, by the way.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.400
It was very nice.

18:16.760 --> 18:21.120
- Lf my dad dies, it's all my fault.
- Why is that?

18:21.560 --> 18:25.040
Dad wanted me to go to college
around here, live at home.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.880
He's a vendor.
Doesn't make much money.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.200
But I wanted Stanford.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.480
I had gotten a scholarship,
but it didn't cover everything.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.440
There were still books, housing.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.760
When he found out,
he said if that was my dream...

18:39.920 --> 18:41.880
...he'd make it happen.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.480
That's when he stopped paying.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.840
- Stopped paying what?
- Protection money.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.440
This bully in the neighbourhood
made all the vendors pay.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.240
- My father was unlicensed, so...
- So he didn't go to the police.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.160
I told him he couldn't
stop paying the guy.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.800
But he said it was the only way
I could go to Stanford.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.280
He was so proud when I had gotten in.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.800
I begged him
to pay the money. But...

19:15.880 --> 19:19.280
The thug that did this to my dad,
can you guys really get him?

19:20.080 --> 19:24.800
- We can try. Who is he?
- His name's Marlon Demeral.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.520
- Marlon Demeral?
- Yeah. So?

19:33.680 --> 19:36.760
- You need to come with us.
- Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.880
- No, hold...
- You can go peacefully or not.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.560
- Hey!
- Let's go.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.360
How about I don't go at all?
What's the emergency?

19:43.520 --> 19:45.760
- You' re wanted for a shooting.
- A Shooting? When?

19:45.920 --> 19:46.920
- Today.
- Today?!

19:47.080 --> 19:49.240
- I didn't shoot nobody.
- What are you doing to my boy?

19:49.400 --> 19:50.600
- Come on.
- Come on, man!

19:50.760 --> 19:53.720
Mama, get the camcorder.
They' re taking Marlon away.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.680
- What is wrong with you?
- Stay in the house.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.280
- He didn't do anything.
- He's my son's father.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.720
- I didn't shoot nobody, man.
- Right.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.880
And who are you to say that?

20:03.040 --> 20:06.200
You a brother? Or did you give that up
to become one of them?

20:06.400 --> 20:09.000
- Look what you' re doing to a brother.
- He's not my brother.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.320
Let go of my boy. Mama, get
the camcorder. They' re taking Marlon.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.920
You ain't got nothing to do today?
He did...

20:15.080 --> 20:17.440
You know what?
You ain't nothing but a Uncle Tom.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.680
Uncle Tom?

20:18.840 --> 20:21.520
That's right. If the Oreo
wrapper fits, wear it, brother.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.800
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.840
Don't go making it black and white.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.200
Take a picture.
Smile for the camera!

20:27.360 --> 20:29.680
Goddamn cops!

20:51.480 --> 20:54.840
But I'm like, Where the hell am
I supposed to find a dental dam...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.040
...at 2 in the morning?
- A dental dam?

20:57.240 --> 20:59.960
A rubber you put on your mouth
when you go down on a chick.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.560
- You serious?
- You feel the need to put on a dam...

21:02.720 --> 21:06.000
...I gotta question what your face
is doing down there in the first place.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.240
She had made a specific request.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.920
Sounds like a petri dish
with legs to me.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.320
I'd think about investing in a couple
of syringes of penicillin.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.880
So I find this Vietnamese convenience
store. And they carried them.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.200
Leave it to Charlie to stock
the dental dams...

21:20.360 --> 21:22.440
...next to the toothpaste.
Are you serious?

21:22.640 --> 21:26.440
I rush back, I slap this thing on
and I am going to town.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.840
I swear, I'm like Gene Simmons on that.
I was like the tao of poon.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.840
I swear to God.

21:33.040 --> 21:36.120
And she's like,
I don't feel anything.

21:36.320 --> 21:40.960
And you' re like,
Really? Because that's my dick.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.000
Have you ever tried to use one
of these things?

21:45.200 --> 21:48.480
I guess you and me dated a different
breed of woman. Down and dirty.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.120
- No pun intended.
- Don't make me hurt you.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.160
- What time is lunch around this place?
- Shut up.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.480
You worked me up an appetite.
Tom here could use a bite too.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.480
- It's sir to you.
- Well, yes, sir.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.240
Uncle Tom is looking mighty hungry.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.440
Detectives, meet Marlon Demeral.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.400
- Pleasure.
- Shut up.

22:24.560 --> 22:29.760
- Is that the only word you ladies know?
- Enjoy. Happy birthday, by the way.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.480
- You told her.
- No.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.360
Yes. By accident.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.800
Come with me, Marlon.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.040
Whatever you say, birthday girl.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.000
So, Lowe, you gonna grab
a beer with us tonight?

22:46.720 --> 22:48.520
Can't. I got other plans.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.320
What's with your partner?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.960
Can't spend a little time
with his fellow boys in blue?

22:53.120 --> 22:55.000
Look, I'm just going
to church tonight.

22:55.200 --> 22:59.360
God can wait. Tonight, my friend,
you get your first B and B.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.280
- What's a B and B?
- A little tradition we have around here.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.440
Nothing like your very first one.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.360
Be at the motor pool at the end of
the shift. Skip out on us, it's your ass.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.400
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What's a B and B?

23:12.560 --> 23:15.560
It's stupid and it's juvenile
and the sooner you get it over with...

23:15.720 --> 23:18.320
...the sooner you'll be accepted
by Jackson and the rest.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.960
Why should I care what they think?

23:21.760 --> 23:25.640
Rule number seven: Those guys
might be overgrown frat boys...

23:25.800 --> 23:29.520
...but someday they could be the only
thing between you and a bullet.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.600
Look, what y'all got
to eat around here?

23:31.760 --> 23:33.760
How about a nice churro?

23:33.960 --> 23:37.520
- You like churros, Marlon?
- Man, that sugary shit is all right.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.320
What I'm really jonesing
for is a cheeseburger.

23:40.960 --> 23:45.000
- Let me see if I can accommodate you.
- My man.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.000
Oh, come on, sweet thing.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.680
Now, I know you got a smile
for me underneath all that.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.760
Dutch?

24:02.480 --> 24:04.200
- Dutch?
- Captain.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.200
I could use your help
with an interrogation.

24:08.360 --> 24:12.280
- I'm in the middle of a case.
- Well, Claudette's got it under control.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.480
All right.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.160
That's what all this is about?
Look, you could've saved me a trip.

24:20.320 --> 24:24.560
Read my lips:
I did not kill Poncho, okay?

24:24.720 --> 24:28.080
Livan Gonzales.
And he's still alive at the moment.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.920
Whatever. I didn't shoot
nobody this morning.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.680
- But I'll turn you on to who did, though.
- Will you now?

24:33.840 --> 24:37.360
Yeah, but you gotta
give me something first.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.680
- And what is that?
- A cheeseburger. I'm hungry as hell.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.640
- Talk first, then you eat.
- Come on.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.480
All right, all right.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, I had a protection thing going
on with those churro chumps.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.640
You know?
And it was a good gig too.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.880
Till last month. This new Mexican gang
comes in packing some serious heat.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.560
Tells me they moving in
on my business.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.040
And what gang was this?

25:04.200 --> 25:07.080
They call themselves
the Los Magníficos.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.280
See, that's what's wrong
with this country.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.200
I'm prime example número uno.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.200
Here I am, trying
to make a serious buck...

25:14.360 --> 25:16.560
...and then in comes some
wetbacks taking my job.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.520
- Your job?
- My job.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.680
Your job was illegally shaking
down churro vendors.

25:23.840 --> 25:27.080
Look, a job is a job, lady.

25:27.960 --> 25:33.040
Now, I like mine well-done,
just like me.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.800
With everything. No onions.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.800
They give me a rash.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.680
I don't find you funny.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.640
You looking for me?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.680
We'd like to ask you some questions.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.520
- About what?
- About how Terry died.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.840
Oh, are you IAD now?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.200
- Seems right up your alley.
- I don't feel IAD checked every angle.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.280
- Oh, so now you got questions.
- I've got a few.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.480
What's stopping me from having
my PBA rep tell you to blow me?

26:06.240 --> 26:07.520
Nothing.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.720
If Vic Mackey wants to hide
behind a lawyer...

26:10.880 --> 26:12.680
...then that's the way it'll be.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.960
You got questions? Fine.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.480
Ask your goddamn questions.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.200
- Why'd you go in without backup?
- A battalion makes a lot of noise.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.920
- The element of surprise.
- Imagine my surprise when I heard...

26:34.080 --> 26:35.240
...you got a guy killed.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.360
Those of us who venture out past
our desks sometimes get shot at.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.760
Could've brought more firepower
without tipping him off.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.680
Well, who should I have had
watching our backs? You?

26:43.840 --> 26:47.960
- I'd hate to have to change your diaper.
- Better than burying one of your own.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.120
So you fired at the dealer,
dealer returned fire, hitting Terry.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.600
No. Like I told IAD...

26:53.760 --> 26:56.680
...Two-Time shot Terry,
then Shane and I returned fire.

26:56.840 --> 27:00.720
- Sounds textbook to me.
- Well, that's all we got.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.480
Thanks for your time.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.440
That's all we've got?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.800
Was that supposed
to make him confess?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.360
No. It's supposed to make him
feel safe.

27:17.520 --> 27:22.080
Now we go after the weak link
in the chain.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.160
Who's the weak link?

27:27.520 --> 27:28.760
What was that all about?

27:28.920 --> 27:32.160
Aceveda's spinning his wheels
as usual.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.800
Enter.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.680
Hey. What can you tell me about
a new gang called Los Magníficos?

27:40.840 --> 27:42.480
Well, they're not so new.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.240
They've been clawing their way
up for the last six months.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.800
Well, I think someone from the gang
pulled the trigger on my churro guy.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.160
Any bushes you can beat?

27:51.320 --> 27:53.920
Looks like we've been invited
to the party, ladies.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.240
Let's go.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.880
Hey, I hear it's your birthday.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.120
Happy birthday.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.800
- Hang on a second.
- I need to ask Shane a few questions.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.000
- Me?
- I need 10 minutes.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.520
I'll send him to catch up with you.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.720
I'm cool.

28:11.880 --> 28:15.160
I'm gonna grab a Coke first.
You need anything?

28:28.560 --> 28:29.960
How's the paintbrush, Van Bro?

28:30.120 --> 28:32.120
Don't be coming here
unless you looking to buy.

28:32.280 --> 28:36.120
No more freebies. You want some info,
you going to buy something this time.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.760
All right. Lem, pick your poison.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.080
What do I know about art, man?

28:41.240 --> 28:43.000
Ronnie?

28:43.320 --> 28:46.240
I kind of like the one
with the clouds.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.680
- Got a place for it?
- Yeah, I guess.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.280
All right. How much?

28:52.680 --> 28:54.720
Give me 100.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.080
And don't be hanging it
in no bathroom neither.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.720
We' re looking for a Los Mag.
Shot up a churro vendor.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.360
People say amigo
didn't wanna pay his freight.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.280
He ignored a couple of warnings.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.720
Los Mags sent in a baby banger
to do the dirty deed.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.200
Earned him his stripes.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.480
- Initiation shooting?
- Things they got these kids doing...

29:23.280 --> 29:27.120
You have to bake a batch of brownies
back in your day, Van Bro?

29:27.640 --> 29:30.720
Getting in the life was a lot more fun
than getting out.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.800
Hey, I heard you lost a man
a few days back.

29:33.960 --> 29:37.040
- Yeah.
- Tough times, Vic.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.240
I don't know. Maybe someday,
somebody will even win in this war.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.080
I intend to.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.160
- See you around, Vic.
- All right, man.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.400
Ready for the barrio?

30:10.040 --> 30:12.840
The wannabe getting initiated,
he's our shooter.

30:13.320 --> 30:17.120
I'll take him. Anybody else gets
caught in our net, it's gravy.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.040
- Are we going in?
- No, this punk-ass wants a beating.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.400
I say we let him have it.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.080
- What's he saying?
- Welcome to the life.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.520
- You were supposed to be his backup.
- We were his backup.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.400
- Why is Terry dead then?
- Wrong place, wrong time.

30:50.560 --> 30:55.440
Aren't you and Vic supposed
to be these kick-ass top cops?

30:55.600 --> 30:57.560
How does somebody
you' re backing up...

30:57.720 --> 31:00.640
...get blown away
by some pissant drug dealer?

31:00.800 --> 31:03.840
- IAD cleared us.
- I didn't clear you.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.600
It just went bad, that's all.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.160
- You lie.
- Notice every time he lies, he squints?

31:10.360 --> 31:11.640
- You squint when you lie.
- I don't.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.760
You' re squinting now.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.400
All right, playtime's over.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.920
Last one down the hill gets
to drink the backwash.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.400
All right, we' re a go
in three, two, one, go!

31:49.520 --> 31:51.040
All right! Police!

31:51.360 --> 31:52.600
Stop right there!
Freeze!

31:54.560 --> 31:57.560
You too! Right there!
Right there, hey!

31:58.880 --> 31:59.920
Do it now!

32:08.800 --> 32:11.240
All right, poquito mas.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.760
Squad 111 available.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.320
You led Terry there to get killed.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.520
- Why would we do that?
- You know why.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.040
Well, IAD cleared us.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.440
Know a drug dealer named
Rondell Robinson?

32:39.600 --> 32:40.880
No.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.000
You' re squinting.
You don't know him?

32:43.160 --> 32:46.600
I know who he is. I meant,
I don't know him personally.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.960
If I had a witness that saw you and Vic
acting friendly with Rondell Robinson...

32:51.440 --> 32:53.520
...that would be a lie.
- That's right.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.120
So that witness didn't see
the three of you at a car wash.

33:00.640 --> 33:04.360
Well, Vic was just putting a scare
into him...

33:04.520 --> 33:06.640
...letting him know
that we were watching him.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.960
- So you lied about that then.
- No, I didn't lie about that!

33:10.440 --> 33:13.560
Terry knew that you were in bed
with Robinson, so Terry had to die.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.160
- Terry was a part of our team.
- You didn't trust him.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.920
- This is bullshit.
- You led Terry into that house to die.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.080
No, not true.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.920
The one guy who disapproved
of Vic is the only team member...

33:23.080 --> 33:25.560
...who didn't come out alive?
That's a coincidence?

33:25.720 --> 33:27.280
Believe what you want.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.800
Terry was gonna turn you in,
so Vic wanted him dead.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.560
- Vic needed him dead!
- No!

33:34.320 --> 33:36.160
Oh, God.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.720
The shot.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.760
- That's what the last shot was.
- The last shot?

33:40.920 --> 33:43.000
Two-Time's girlfriend says
in her statement that...

33:43.160 --> 33:47.200
...she heard the last shot 10,
15 seconds after the others.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.640
When we approached Two-Time,
he moved.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.680
- Vic couldn't leave it to chance.
- Vic fired once more.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.640
- That's the shot that killed Terry.
- No way.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.720
- Vic fired that shot, didn't he?
- No.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.760
Stop squinting!

34:02.320 --> 34:04.160
I know.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.640
I know.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.320
You' re wrong.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.960
I want Mackey.
You don't have to go down with him.

34:21.719 --> 34:24.000
- That is not how it happened.
- Stop lying to me.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.639
I know what happened.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.840
I have a witness, Shane.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.199
He connects you and Vic with
Rondell Robinson. I have a witness.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.239
Give me Vic and your problems end.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.440
Just give me Mackey.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.639
What the hell's going on?
You've had him here for two hours?

34:48.800 --> 34:52.360
- He's making up sick shit about us, Vic.
- Go downstairs and wait for me.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.760
- This whole thing is a joke.
- Grab a sandwich, Dutchboy.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.120
I know what you did.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.200
Up until now, I've tolerated you.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.800
You come near my men again,
I'm gonna lose patience.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.960
You listening?

35:18.520 --> 35:20.440
I know.

35:32.160 --> 35:32.280
The churro guy you shot's in surgery.
Doctors don't know if he'll live.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.480
The churro guy you shot's in surgery.
Doctors don't know if he'll live.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.600
Tell her you didn't shoot this man.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.520
Tell me who put you up to this, I'll see
if I can get you placed in juvie court.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.200
If you wait and he dies though,
you'll be tried for murder as an adult.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.680
Olman, please tell her
you didn't do this.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.640
- Of course I didn't do it.
- You see?

35:49.800 --> 35:55.440
I shoot someone, he don't almost
end up dead. Bitch ends up all dead.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.120
That's your alibi? If you'd have
shot him, he'd be dead?

35:59.280 --> 36:01.880
Hell, yeah, that's my alibi.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.360
Guess what.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.560
- Churro guy's actually gonna make it.
- Good.

36:13.720 --> 36:17.040
You won't believe what just went
down between Aceveda and Mackey.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.640
- I don't wanna know.
- Yeah. No. But this is...

36:19.800 --> 36:22.120
Anyone gets between those two
is just gonna end up...

36:22.280 --> 36:25.840
...with a hose full of piss
running down his leg.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.720
Good news and bad news.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.320
Bad news is...

36:35.040 --> 36:37.120
...the churro vendor just died.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.520
Good news for your son. Someone
else is taking credit for the killing.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.000
Thank you, Jesus.

36:43.160 --> 36:47.000
Yeah. Some guy named Marlon
walked in off the street, said...

36:47.160 --> 36:50.440
...your gang was trying to muscle in on
his business, so he decided to show...

36:50.640 --> 36:52.800
...the vendors your gang
couldn't protect him.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.640
- Marlon didn't do no shooting.
- He did.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.560
Everyone is talking about how
he showed your boys up.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.880
The old man stopped paying us.
That's my shooting.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.440
- He's just looking to piggyback a rep.
- Olman, no.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.120
So you' re trying to take credit
for what happened now?

37:05.280 --> 37:07.800
I told you if I shot him
he'd be dead, right?

37:07.960 --> 37:11.480
People need to know.
Los Mags own these streets.

37:12.440 --> 37:16.160
- Who asked you to do the shooting?
- I ain't never telling you that.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.560
These are my brothers now.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.840
Do you know what this means,
Olman?

37:21.040 --> 37:25.320
- Means I earned my way in.
- No. It means you' re going to jail.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.840
At least I' II have family there.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.640
Tell me you didn't reopen
an investigation that wasn't yours.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.960
There were unanswered questions.

37:49.160 --> 37:52.520
You accused Vic Mackey of working
with a dealer. Who's your witness?

37:53.120 --> 37:55.960
- Anonymous tip.
- Anyone who can corroborate it?

37:59.800 --> 38:03.800
Is there something you know that
explains why you' re still pursuing this?

38:06.120 --> 38:07.840
Well?

38:09.080 --> 38:10.280
No.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.640
Then it ends here.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.120
Christ, David.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.680
You' re doing a good job.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.440
The chief said so the other day.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.520
Don't lose focus now.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.280
I won't.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Good.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.480
Thanks for getting Capt. Ass Invader
off my back.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.960
It wouldn't kill you to show
him more respect.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.200
Come on.

38:36.360 --> 38:40.440
Hey, Vic. The men here take their cues
from you. I'm just saying dial it down.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.080
I don't do my best work
with him nipping at my heels.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.280
- Which is why I'm watching out for you.
- Good.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.760
Question is, are you watching
out for me?

38:48.920 --> 38:50.200
Meaning?

38:50.360 --> 38:53.200
My guys tipped you off that Terry
was looking to take you down.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.200
The bust just went bad.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.240
My source at Justice is all over
my ass. He wants to know if...

38:58.400 --> 39:00.800
...you made us all accomplices
to a murder.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.840
I told him you'd never,
never do that to me.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.520
Would you?

39:10.840 --> 39:13.360
Terry got overeager.
He got himself killed.

39:15.200 --> 39:19.120
- End of story?
- End of story.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.360
It better be.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.640
Is this from you?

39:38.200 --> 39:41.480
No. I know how you feel
about birthdays.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.600
Denture cream.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.680
Thank you.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.440
Tells you I'm getting old.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.960
I don't see a card.
Anyone wanna take credit for this?

39:59.120 --> 40:02.520
- Not me.
- I didn't think so.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.640
- How's the birthday girl doing?
- Don't say that word.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.560
- I came to take you dancing.
- I don't wanna go dancing.

40:08.720 --> 40:11.200
We gotta do something, honey.
It's your birthday.

40:11.360 --> 40:16.800
- So?
- So it's ladies' night at the Crimson.

40:16.960 --> 40:21.200
I have it on very good authority that
Franklin Green's gonna be there.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.440
- His divorce final?
- Two weeks ago.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.320
Well, I can't let Franklin Green
see me looking like this.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.440
Which is why we' re gonna spruce
up first, then go to the Crimson.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.080
We' re too old to be chasing
men around.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.960
- I'm not.
- Neither am I. Come on.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.880
<i>Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.</i>

40:50.040 --> 40:52.840
- Drink!
- Drink!

40:53.000 --> 40:56.400
Who said that Jesus freak
couldn't drink, huh?

40:57.480 --> 40:59.720
Your B and B's almost complete,
buddy boy.

40:59.880 --> 41:03.280
You had the beer,
now it's time for the blow.

41:03.520 --> 41:08.040
- You are kidding.
- I kid you not. She's a badge-sucker.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.040
- What's a badge...?
- A badge-sucker.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.520
She digs cops, okay? She's like the
neighbourhood welcoming committee.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.680
Listen, listen. A better hummer
you' re not gonna find. Trust me.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.320
- Look, I cannot...
- No, no. Stay, stay.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.080
- No. I got...
- Sit down.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.320
It isn't torture, okay?
We've all gone through this.

41:27.520 --> 41:32.160
- Julien, say hi to Betty.
- So this is the new guy.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.320
Go!

41:34.600 --> 41:37.000
Welcome to the force.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.160
- Handsome.
- And he's lucky too.

41:40.320 --> 41:44.360
- Can we go for a walk?
- No, fellas, I cannot. L... No, no, no!

41:44.520 --> 41:47.440
No! Hey, come on, now.
I can't.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.720
Go!

41:53.720 --> 41:56.160
Give it up, man.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.080
Wait. Come on.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.160
Come on.
Let's get you over here.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.680
Relax, officer.

42:08.840 --> 42:11.760
This is a lot more fun
than roll call.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.280
You don't have to do this.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.600
Check this out.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.720
Oh, yeah.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.280
Oh, she love him long time.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.800
Thanks a lot.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.960
You don't put me in an interrogation
room without giving me all the facts.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.800
I wanted them to feel like you had
nothing. Then I could take my shot.

43:12.960 --> 43:16.120
You didn't think they'd respect
me enough to fear me?

43:19.040 --> 43:21.400
No, I didn't.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.760
- Well, that's pretty shitty.
- Sorry.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.560
You really think Vic had something
to do with Terry dying?
