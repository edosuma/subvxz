OK, so it might have taken me

00:50.341 --> 00:52.010
Weeks to get used to the idea,

00:52.469 --> 00:53.928
but now, I'm actually excited!

00:54.012 --> 00:56.264
Just imagine: me, a big sister!

00:56.848 --> 00:57.974
There's so much to do.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.935
Starting with the nursery:
a frontier theme

01:01.227 --> 01:04.147
with a mural of a wild mustang herd
racing across the land.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.649
Oh. I'll teach her to ride.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.986
-And Spirit will help her pick a horse!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.323
That's years and years away.
I think you're getting ahead of yourself.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.868
I'm just really looking forward
to having a little sister or a brother.

01:17.452 --> 01:21.664
Or twins. Yay! I want twins!
We'll always have a tie-breaker.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.542
Your sister or brother
is going to be a baby at first, Lucky,

01:25.126 --> 01:27.170
and that's
a very different kettle of fish.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.217
Right. Crying, and diapers,
and spitting up and getting no sleep.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.760
You'll both need so much help.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.180
Don't worry. I'm going to be
the best babysitter that ever sat.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.098
That's very sweet of you.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.185
You just leave the baby with me,
and don't think twice about it.

01:42.727 --> 01:46.231
[laughs]
Well, we'll see how it goes.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.441
What do you mean? Don't you trust me?

01:49.234 --> 01:50.527
Of course we do, but...

01:51.152 --> 01:54.656
it's just that sometimes,
you get a little distracted.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.074
Distracted?

01:58.743 --> 02:00.954
Distracted and irresponsible.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.873
Me? Distracted? Irresponsible?

02:04.374 --> 02:05.291

-[gasps]

02:08.336 --> 02:10.171

02:10.380 --> 02:11.631
[Kate] Is something burning?

02:13.133 --> 02:16.094
Oh!
[coughs]

02:16.678 --> 02:17.679
[Lucky grunts]

02:20.515 --> 02:21.724
[Lucky grunts]

02:25.687 --> 02:27.021
[Lucky grunts]

02:28.523 --> 02:29.941
That was a fire drill.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.653
OK, maybe sometimes I get carried away,

02:34.028 --> 02:36.197
but this is going to be
my little brother or sister.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.283
I'll prove that I'm responsible enough.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.744
-And just how will you do that?
-Mm...

02:41.828 --> 02:44.497
By being responsible enough
to figure out a way to prove it.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.415
[clatter]

02:50.879 --> 02:53.923
[Lucky] I'm the most responsible kid
in my entire family.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.927
OK, I may be the only kid,
but that counts for something.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.305
How can they not think
I'm ready to be a big sister?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.557
Lucky, just wait till the baby comes.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.517
Then do your best. You'll be fine.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.436
Then why don't they trust me now?

03:06.811 --> 03:08.396
Look how I'm cleaning Spirit's stall.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.481
Ew, what is this?

03:11.566 --> 03:16.487
Hmm. Vanilla cake with vanilla icing:
Turo's birthday last month.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.324
-Ugh!
-Oh, Snips hides sweets for later.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.658
Like an evil squirrel.

03:21.242 --> 03:24.078
OK, maybe I should clean Spirit's stall
more often, but still--

03:24.162 --> 03:25.872
Hey. No plundering.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.666
Snips, no riding in the barn.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.962
-Also, don't eat that cake. It's mouldy.
-Says you all, jealous!

03:33.171 --> 03:34.213
Try and stop me.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.426
[she grunts angrily and sighs]

03:39.135 --> 03:39.969
Humph.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.805
You should count your blessings
that nobody wants you to babysit.

03:45.058 --> 03:45.934
That's it!

03:46.017 --> 03:48.186
Abigail, can I babysit your brother
tomorrow?

03:48.269 --> 03:49.520
-[Abigail] What?
-[Pru] No!

03:49.604 --> 03:51.814
It's the only way to prove
that I'm responsible enough

03:51.898 --> 03:53.107
to be a good big sister.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.859
It can't be the only way.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.653
Yeah. Start smaller, Lucky.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.529
Snips is a handful on a regular day,

03:58.613 --> 04:00.657
and tomorrow is Haircut Day.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.659
Has it been a year already?

04:03.910 --> 04:04.911
[Pru shudders]

04:05.203 --> 04:06.371
[Lucky] What's Haircut Day?

04:06.454 --> 04:08.248
Snips hates getting a haircut so much,

04:08.331 --> 04:10.667
getting him to the barbershop
is just about impossible,

04:11.167 --> 04:13.002
so, we only try to take him once a year.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.087
That's perfect.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.589
If I can wrangle the worst kid
on the worst day,

04:16.714 --> 04:18.466
my parents will see that I'm responsible.

04:18.549 --> 04:19.550
[Abigail] I don't know.

04:19.634 --> 04:23.221
I've been Snips' sister for six years,
and it's a never ending headache!

04:23.596 --> 04:27.517
Once he filled my bed with jelly,
and I was stuck to my sheets all day.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.102
When I tried to babysit,

04:29.477 --> 04:33.064
Snips glued my shoes to the floor
while I was still wearing them.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.190
He's the worst.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.151
I mean, he's my brother
and I love him more than anything,

04:37.443 --> 04:38.486
but he's the worst.

04:38.736 --> 04:42.615
So, what do you say we give up
on this crazy mission and go for a ride?

04:47.161 --> 04:49.706
[Abigail] Lucky, are you sure
you want to do this?

04:50.331 --> 04:53.001
Once I open this door,
there's no closing it.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.420
It's not too late. No one would blame you.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.088
PALS! I'm sure.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.340
[Abigail] Remember,
the barbershop closes at five.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.426
That's hours from now. No problem.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.261
Also remember, we're here to help.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.972
No. I need to do this on my own.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.182
You can't interfere. Promise?

05:08.266 --> 05:09.267
Promise.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.770
OK, then.
Big Sister Lucky, time to shine.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.230
[dramatic music]

05:14.731 --> 05:16.566
[sighs]
Morning ladies.

05:16.899 --> 05:22.322
Snips, I'll be looking after you today,
so, you need to do what I say,

05:22.405 --> 05:25.408
and what I say is:
I'm taking you to the barbershop.

05:25.783 --> 05:29.245
What gives?
How many sisters do I gotta deal with?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.373
Lucky's your sister for today,
and you will mind her.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.876
OK, sis.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.628
I just need to pick up Señor Carrots
at the barn first.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.380
Hmm.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.091
You wouldn't make a boy get his hair cut

05:42.175 --> 05:45.386
without his best donkey by his side,
would you?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.724
OK. That seems OK,

05:50.391 --> 05:52.310
but I'm not letting you out of my sight.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.563
I hope not.
You're supposed to be looking after me.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.023
Chop-chop!

06:03.780 --> 06:06.115
[Snips] So, you wanna learn
to be a good big sister, huh?

06:06.908 --> 06:09.327
Well, you came to the right place.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.536
I taught Abigail.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.831
She's the best big sister
in the whole world.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.210
-[squelch]
-Ugh yuck!

06:17.668 --> 06:19.253
Why is your hand so sticky?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.172
My pet raccoon has a cold.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.216
-[squelch]
-Ooh.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.550
You have a pet raccoon?

06:24.842 --> 06:27.845
Yeah, only I'm not allowed to bring
Mr. Titters inside

06:28.054 --> 06:29.055
or feed him.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.890
He's more like a secret pet.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.976
Señor Carrots!

06:34.268 --> 06:36.729
Come on,
we're gonna get our hairs cut.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.815
He's probably still sleeping.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.233
He's a night owl.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.567
I'll get him.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.861
OK, but then it's haircut time.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.990
See, Spirit. This'll be a piece of cake.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.076
Not like the piece I found in your stall,

06:50.159 --> 06:51.452
a nice piece of cake.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.873
-Like the wind!
-[Lucky] Snips, get back here!

06:57.959 --> 06:59.544
OK, I should have seen that coming.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.879
Good thing I have the fastest horse
in the world.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.757
[Abigail] Don't worry so much.
I think Lucky has a real shot.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.843
-[Spirit neighs]
-[Lucky] Everything's fine.

Huh, she beat my time.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.188
Oh, there you are.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.859
I... You were the one who ran off.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.903
Never mind. We're going to the barbershop.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.030
-Now.
-Oh, I already went.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.700
Got the haircut and everything.
You like it?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.326
You just left the barn.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.537
There's no way you had time
to get to the barbershop.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.874
-Aw, why are you persecuting me?
-[sad music]

07:37.957 --> 07:39.542
What? I'm not.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.669
-Snips, get up.
-[Snips] No.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.212
I'm going to count to three.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.466
One, two...

07:47.967 --> 07:49.594
What happens when you get to three?

07:50.386 --> 07:51.262
I...

07:51.846 --> 07:52.680

07:53.181 --> 07:54.807
Let me know when you decide.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.729
[Abigail] Threats are a bad idea,
but empty threats are a terrible idea.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.357
-We have to help her.
-Nope. We promised we wouldn't interfere.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.448

Snips, if you get a haircut,
I'll buy you ice cream.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.245
Seems like a square deal to me.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.207
-[Snips]Deal.
-Ugh, yuck!

08:19.290 --> 08:21.501
Course, I'll need the ice cream up front.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.341
You know, Snips, we had a rough start,

08:28.424 --> 08:30.968
but I think I'm getting the hang
of this sister stuff.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.638
As soon as we're done,
we'll get you to the barbershop--

08:33.721 --> 08:36.140
Lucky, you're the best big sister ever.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.809
Can I have another scoop, first? Please?

08:39.560 --> 08:41.062

don't give him the treat first.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.907
Giving Snips sugar
probably wasn't smart either.

I'm proud of you. Er, so where is Snips?

You should be.
You pulled every trick in the book today.

I'll cut off every single hair--

to Lasso Flats!

How am I going to tell Abigail?

17:08.068 --> 17:11.572
Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not responsible!

17:11.864 --> 17:13.198
I should leave too.

than I'll ever be.

Huh? What do you want, Mary Pat?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.833
My sister has something to tell you.

Spill it.

17:24.793 --> 17:28.881
Snips didn't get on the train.
He told me to lie to you.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.634
He bribed her with a jawbreaker,
which he stole from me.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.261
Sorry, Lucky.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.056
I'm not sorry. I'd do it all again!

of his tricks.

I know how you feel.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.485
Bianca's three minutes younger.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.737
I've always had to watch out for her.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.781
It's true. She keeps me honest.

Don't give up on Snips.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.415
But how am I going to even find him
in time to get him to the barber?

18:03.665 --> 18:06.585
Whenever I need to find Bianca,
I try to think like her.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.215
I bet he's doing something awful.

Snips is drawn to trouble
like ants to cake.

-There are no days off for big sisters.

I think she's got it.

Save it, Snips.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.631
I was so close.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.721
Aw, cheer up, Lucky.
You're in good company.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.641
Abigail's a bad big sister too.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.730
I only had a little brother for one day,
and I'm exhausted!

21:14.147 --> 21:16.566
There's no way I can do this every day.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.068
Forever.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.820
I'm a failure.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.071
You didn't fail.

21:21.363 --> 21:25.033
Are you kidding?
I yelled at him and threw my boot at him!

21:25.367 --> 21:27.869
It didn't hit him,
but only because I have terrible aim.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.122
Oh, and I didn't get him
to the barbershop,

21:30.455 --> 21:32.958
the only thing I was supposed to do today.

21:33.041 --> 21:36.670
Sure, but I told you,
that's almost impossible.

21:36.878 --> 21:40.132
We try to get his haircut once a year,
but look at him.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.718
It's been years since that mop
has seen scissors.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.428
All you can do is try.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.346
Look at everything you had to put up with.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.348
And you did. All of it.

21:48.598 --> 21:51.101
You know, with all the talk
of little brothers and sisters,

21:51.226 --> 21:53.854
I was starting to feel kind of sad
that I didn't have any.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.356
But after everything
you went through today,

21:56.440 --> 21:58.275
I'm glad I'm an only child.

22:00.402 --> 22:04.114
No, but seriously, Lucky,
I would've given up, but you didn't.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.242
So you can tell your folks you're ready
to be a responsible big sister.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.996
After today, I don't want to be
a responsible big sister.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.249
Sorry, Lucky, but you don't have a choice.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.668
Good news is you're gonna be great.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.545
Plus, after all that running around,

22:18.628 --> 22:21.381
Snips is passed out
in Señor Carrots' stall right now.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.594
You know, when he's asleep like that,

22:26.178 --> 22:27.679
he's almost kind of cute.
