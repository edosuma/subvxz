I'm looking at Farhad Ghazi
as we speak.

00:19.146 --> 00:20.378
What the fuck?

00:20.380 --> 00:22.547
<i>- Saul.</i>
- Take the shot.

00:22.549 --> 00:24.116
- Carrie!
- We're losing our window.

00:24.118 --> 00:26.451
- It's Saul.
- Take the shot, goddamn it!

00:26.453 --> 00:28.553
Are you out of your mind?

00:28.555 --> 00:29.955
That is Saul!

00:35.162 --> 00:37.729
You were one of the last people
to see him before he was taken.

00:37.731 --> 00:39.965
Only because you sent him
on a mission to stir up trouble.

00:39.967 --> 00:41.566
That puts you at
the center of this.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.001
You said you found something.

00:43.003 --> 00:44.569

Don't!

01:25.312 --> 01:27.212
Yes, it's me.

Here.

05:06.962 --> 05:08.328
I'm fine.

05:08.330 --> 05:11.865
You do seem better
than last night at least.

05:11.867 --> 05:14.234
You were in quite a state.

05:22.477 --> 05:25.478
Is...

05:25.480 --> 05:27.547
is this your house?

05:27.549 --> 05:30.884
Yes.

05:40.028 --> 05:42.128
How did I get here?

05:42.130 --> 05:45.298
You don't remember?

05:47.536 --> 05:49.068
My men brought you here.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.741
Why?

05:54.743 --> 05:56.643
You were causing a commotion
in the street.

05:56.645 --> 05:59.379
The police had you in custody
by the time we got to you.

05:59.381 --> 06:01.381
Like I said,

06:01.383 --> 06:03.716
you were in quite a state.

06:09.658 --> 06:11.891
You really don't remember.

06:16.197 --> 06:19.299
You told me some things
about yourself last night.

06:21.336 --> 06:23.336
You thought I was someone else,

06:23.338 --> 06:26.272
someone you were fond of.

06:26.274 --> 06:28.508
Someone who died.

06:36.017 --> 06:37.383
Hey, hey.

06:37.385 --> 06:40.219
Hey, you need to rest.

06:40.221 --> 06:42.522
No.

07:10.151 --> 07:11.551
So, where in the hell is she?

07:11.553 --> 07:12.752
Unclear.

07:12.754 --> 07:13.786
We're checking
into that right now.

07:13.788 --> 07:15.154
Should I be worried?

07:15.156 --> 07:17.123
At this point, only about Saul.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.491
So, are we ready then?

07:18.493 --> 07:19.459
Yeah.

07:19.461 --> 07:20.994
- We listen, right?
- Right.

07:20.996 --> 07:23.062
Whatever they say,
however incendiary it seems.

07:23.064 --> 07:24.397
Okay, I get it.

07:24.399 --> 07:25.798
Keep my mouth shut.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.634
It wasn't easy to repair
the damage the last time.

07:27.636 --> 07:30.003
Not sure I can do it again.

07:36.778 --> 07:38.144
You're cutting it close.

07:38.146 --> 07:39.912
I had an unexpected guest.

07:39.914 --> 07:40.913
I heard.

07:40.915 --> 07:41.848
You did?

07:41.850 --> 07:43.282
Yeah.

07:43.284 --> 07:44.417
Do you want to tell me
why you intervened?

07:44.419 --> 07:45.985
I didn't "intervene,"

07:45.987 --> 07:47.687
she was out in the streets
acting crazy.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.322
Wasn't going to end well.

07:49.324 --> 07:51.124
I thought the last thing
we needed was another incident

07:51.126 --> 07:52.191
with a CIA station chief.

07:52.193 --> 07:53.860
Why do you think that was?

07:53.862 --> 07:55.662
What?

07:55.664 --> 07:58.498
Carrie Mathison out of her mind.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.033
What was that about?

08:00.035 --> 08:01.734
Did you bother to ask yourself?

08:02.971 --> 08:05.171
She has a history
of mental illness.

08:05.173 --> 08:06.539
I didn't know.

08:06.541 --> 08:07.840
She would've been
on a plane right now,

08:07.842 --> 08:09.475
back home,
relieved of her post,

08:09.477 --> 08:11.577
but you got in the way.

08:13.381 --> 08:15.181
Should have told me.

08:15.183 --> 08:17.483
If you had something going on,
you should have said.

08:17.485 --> 08:20.286
- We okay here?
- Not really. - Sure.

08:20.288 --> 08:21.621
Come on.

08:21.623 --> 08:24.724
We have kept them waiting
long enough.

09:04.699 --> 09:06.365
Get up.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.967
Get up, out.

09:35.263 --> 09:39.532
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

09:39.534 --> 09:41.134
Nothing they ask.

09:41.136 --> 09:42.101
Don't do it.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.236
Not anything.

09:43.238 --> 09:44.637
Not a fucking thing.

09:44.639 --> 09:45.805
You tell them to go
to fucking hell!

09:45.807 --> 09:48.174
Tell them to go to fucking hell!

09:58.086 --> 10:01.320
You tell them if he's hurt,
all bets are off.

10:01.322 --> 10:03.055
- They know that.
- Tell them.

10:03.057 --> 10:05.091
I'll try to convey the message.

10:05.093 --> 10:06.826
Oh, you'll try.

10:13.334 --> 10:15.301
Abdul Zaheer.

10:16.271 --> 10:18.271
Faysal Ahmad.

10:18.273 --> 10:19.939
Amir Wasif.

10:19.941 --> 10:21.174
What's he doing?

10:21.176 --> 10:23.843
Hafiz Jan.

10:23.845 --> 10:25.344
Mustafa Hashmi.

10:26.648 --> 10:28.881
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

10:38.927 --> 10:40.960
Those are prisoner
names, aren't they?

10:40.962 --> 10:43.129
Yes, the ones you're
holding at Bagram.

10:43.131 --> 10:45.598
So, he wants an exchange.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.833
Obviously this will take time.

10:46.835 --> 10:47.934
He must know that.

10:47.936 --> 10:49.635
Amir Wasif was responsible

10:49.637 --> 10:52.338
for the marketplace bombing
at Karachi, am I right?

10:53.541 --> 10:55.107
Forget what he's done to us;

10:55.109 --> 10:57.610
he killed three dozen of
your citizens that day.

10:57.612 --> 10:59.212
You really want him
back on the street?

10:59.214 --> 11:01.881
These are Haqqani's
demands, not ours.

11:01.883 --> 11:04.116
We're as shocked as you
to hear that name.

11:04.118 --> 11:05.284
You are?

11:05.286 --> 11:07.186
- Really?
- Okay.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.055
This is an unexpected
development.

11:09.057 --> 11:10.656
Obviously nothing can happen

11:10.658 --> 11:13.192
until we consult with
our respective governments.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.528
I'd like to suggest
that we reconvene

11:15.530 --> 11:17.363
same time tomorrow morning.

12:57.899 --> 13:01.500
So you're feeling better.

13:01.502 --> 13:03.836
Can I get you anything?

13:10.178 --> 13:13.512
Why... why were your men
following me?

13:14.816 --> 13:17.183
They weren't.

13:17.185 --> 13:19.251
You said they brought me here.

13:19.253 --> 13:21.587
The police notified us
you were acting strangely.

13:21.589 --> 13:23.823
Oh, so the police
were following me.

13:23.825 --> 13:24.857
Only after

13:24.859 --> 13:26.359
you beat up a security guard

13:26.361 --> 13:28.160
and started shooting people
with your fingers.

13:28.162 --> 13:31.530
Is that what I was doing?

13:33.201 --> 13:35.835
Well, maybe that was because
someone fucked with my meds.

13:35.837 --> 13:37.636
What?

13:37.638 --> 13:39.672
My pills.

13:39.674 --> 13:41.107
That I rely on.

13:41.109 --> 13:44.543
I'm wondering if someone
tampered with them.

13:48.516 --> 13:51.650
I guess you don't think
it's out of the question.

13:51.652 --> 13:54.453
And what, you think I did it?

13:54.455 --> 13:57.023
I didn't say that.

13:57.025 --> 13:58.057
But did you?

13:58.059 --> 14:00.059
No.

14:00.061 --> 14:02.828
Well, who did?

14:02.830 --> 14:04.730
I have no idea.

14:06.467 --> 14:08.200
But you'd tell me, right?

14:08.202 --> 14:09.668
Mr. Helpful, with your men

14:09.670 --> 14:11.971
who just happened to be
out in the streets?

14:11.973 --> 14:13.406
You have this all wrong.
I saved you.

14:13.408 --> 14:15.241
- Yeah. Well, thanks.
- You need to rest.

14:15.243 --> 14:17.977
Get out of my way.

14:19.714 --> 14:21.147
Where are you going?

14:23.217 --> 14:25.484
Let me drive you
back to the embassy.

14:25.486 --> 14:27.753
I'll get there myself.

14:45.339 --> 14:46.772
Your new meds.

14:46.774 --> 14:49.108
- Thank you.
- Okay.

14:51.179 --> 14:53.279
Carrie, where have you been?
What happened?

14:53.281 --> 14:55.915
We have a breach
here at the embassy.

14:55.917 --> 14:58.084
- What?
- Someone switched out my meds.

14:58.086 --> 14:59.218
Where's Lockhart?

14:59.220 --> 15:00.953
Uh, with the ambassador,
I think.

15:00.955 --> 15:02.755
Pry him away, discreetly.

15:02.757 --> 15:05.191
I need you, him and me in the
secure room as soon as possible.

15:05.193 --> 15:07.426
Just the three of us, until we
figure out who we can trust.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.028
Okay.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.867
<i>How could this possibly happen?</i>

15:14.869 --> 15:18.304
It's pretty clear how.
Someone got in my room.

15:18.306 --> 15:20.439
Who could do this?

15:20.441 --> 15:21.707
I don't know.

15:21.709 --> 15:22.741
We need to bring

15:22.743 --> 15:24.410
the ambassador into this.

15:24.412 --> 15:25.644
We need to bring
no one into this,

15:25.646 --> 15:27.446
not until we think it through.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.882
Do you know how many people go
in and out of here every day?

15:29.884 --> 15:31.650
Finding the one
working against us--

15:31.652 --> 15:33.953
or who knows, maybe
there's more than one.

15:35.089 --> 15:37.223
Did you brief her on
the Saul situation?

15:37.225 --> 15:38.457
I was waiting for you.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.559
Another clusterfuck.

15:41.829 --> 15:44.396
What Haqqani wants for Saul.

15:44.398 --> 15:47.333
A prisoner exchange.

15:47.335 --> 15:50.836
This is Haqqani's
entire command structure.

15:50.838 --> 15:52.771
We can't do it.

15:52.773 --> 15:54.073
That's what I said
in the meeting.

15:54.075 --> 15:55.474
You give up these five,

15:55.476 --> 15:57.076
he basically controls
from here to Kabul.

15:57.078 --> 15:58.310
I think that's the point.

16:00.114 --> 16:01.647
So what's the plan?

16:01.649 --> 16:04.150
What plan?

16:04.152 --> 16:05.317
There's no plan.

16:05.319 --> 16:06.785
No one wants this.

16:06.787 --> 16:09.288
Not us, not the White House,

16:09.290 --> 16:11.924
not Saul-- especially not Saul.

16:11.926 --> 16:16.328
But I will not have
my predecessor joining

16:16.330 --> 16:19.331
Daniel Pearl and Jim Foley
with their heads in a basket.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.534
So you tell me, what do we do?

16:25.306 --> 16:27.206
We find another way.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.542
I'm gonna need
something more specific.

16:29.544 --> 16:31.177
In the meantime,

16:31.179 --> 16:33.445
I need to let the ambassador
know what happened to you.

16:33.447 --> 16:34.813
- Sir...
- I was cross with

16:34.815 --> 16:36.615
our Pakistani
friends again today.

16:36.617 --> 16:37.850
She made me promise...

16:37.852 --> 16:41.387
transparency, teamwork...

16:41.389 --> 16:44.990
Uh, there was another "T,"
I forget what the fuck it was.

16:44.992 --> 16:47.459
You told me you were

16:47.461 --> 16:49.762
gonna get this place
under control.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.037
So you didn't exactly say

16:58.039 --> 16:59.738
what happened to
you last night.

16:59.740 --> 17:03.375
I don't know what happened
to me last night.

17:03.377 --> 17:04.810
Really.

17:04.811 --> 17:07.378
I-I ended up at the residence
of Colonel Khan.

17:07.381 --> 17:09.248
The ISI counterterrorism chief?

17:10.685 --> 17:12.917
He said his men "found" me.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.087
Some police lockup, apparently.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.756
And you don't remember?

17:17.758 --> 17:19.558
Not really.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.895
Just that it was...

17:22.896 --> 17:24.063
it was crazy.

17:24.065 --> 17:26.065
Pretty fucking low of them.

17:26.067 --> 17:28.834
They exploited a weakness.

17:28.836 --> 17:30.603
They poisoned you.

17:32.340 --> 17:34.773
At least there are no illusions
where anyone stands.

17:40.681 --> 17:43.382
Oh, fuck.

17:43.384 --> 17:45.284
Goddamn it.

17:56.063 --> 17:57.763
Come on.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.277
Ow!

18:11.279 --> 18:13.212
God!

19:10.838 --> 19:13.472
You're sure about this?
This breach?

19:13.474 --> 19:16.175
You tell me how else
it could have happened.

19:16.177 --> 19:18.677
Fine. I'll start the
changeover protocol.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.347
New locks, new codes.

19:21.349 --> 19:23.349
I feel like
I'm in a fucking war.

19:23.351 --> 19:24.950
What did you expect?

19:24.952 --> 19:26.352
I don't know.

19:26.354 --> 19:29.054
Isn't Pakistan supposed
to be on our side?

19:31.859 --> 19:33.792
I really don't know
how you do it.

19:33.794 --> 19:36.328
Sit across from them,
day after day,

19:36.330 --> 19:38.864
knowing all they want
is to stab us in the back.

19:38.866 --> 19:39.998
I'm a diplomat.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.533
It's my job.

19:41.535 --> 19:42.568
To eat shit.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.370
To suck it up,

19:44.372 --> 19:45.571
if that's what it takes

19:45.573 --> 19:47.906
to find areas
of common interest.

19:47.908 --> 19:50.542
They hate us.

19:50.544 --> 19:54.246
Good luck finding
common interest in that.

19:58.018 --> 19:59.918
Hey.

20:01.889 --> 20:03.889
He doesn't look too happy.

20:03.891 --> 20:05.691
Neither do you,
for that matter.

20:05.693 --> 20:09.328
These may be just the thing.

20:09.330 --> 20:11.163
From Reema's.

20:11.165 --> 20:12.931
I was passing by after work.

20:15.202 --> 20:18.404
These are genuine balushahi.

20:18.406 --> 20:21.039
That's like halfway to a donut.

20:21.041 --> 20:24.576
Don't go outside, okay?

20:24.578 --> 20:26.044
What do you mean?

20:26.046 --> 20:28.180
Let someone else teach
your class for a while.

20:28.182 --> 20:30.048
Can you do that?

20:30.050 --> 20:31.383
It's not safe.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.620
It's not like
I'm an ex-director of anything.

20:34.622 --> 20:36.088
No one's gonna take me.

20:36.090 --> 20:39.558
There are other things going on.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.460
Like what?

20:43.264 --> 20:45.564
Fine. I understand.

20:45.566 --> 20:46.799
There's been a breach here.

20:46.801 --> 20:48.634
In the embassy.

20:48.636 --> 20:50.969
You can't tell anyone, okay?

20:52.740 --> 20:55.808
Sure.

20:56.644 --> 20:58.877
Just be careful.

22:55.396 --> 22:56.762
Hello.

22:57.932 --> 22:59.398
Thank God.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.099
Carrie, it's me.

23:03.504 --> 23:05.437
Quinn!

23:05.439 --> 23:07.773
- Quinn, get up.
- Just a second.

23:09.009 --> 23:10.208
- Saul escaped.
- Where is he?

23:10.210 --> 23:11.543
He doesn't know; he's on foot.

23:11.545 --> 23:13.946
He's calling back in 15--
11 minutes.

23:13.948 --> 23:15.747
We have to locate him and
put together an exfil plan.

23:17.952 --> 23:19.351
Did he call?

23:19.353 --> 23:20.552
Not yet. You ready?

23:20.554 --> 23:21.620
Good to go.

23:21.622 --> 23:22.721
We needed a break.

23:22.723 --> 23:24.289
Maybe we finally got one.

23:25.259 --> 23:27.259
Right on time.

23:27.261 --> 23:29.261
Saul.

23:30.564 --> 23:32.064
What do I do?

23:32.066 --> 23:33.131
Saul, it's Quinn.
We need to locate you first.

23:33.133 --> 23:34.099
What can you see?

23:34.101 --> 23:36.234
Nothing. It's pitch black.

23:36.236 --> 23:37.369
I can't see my feet.

23:37.371 --> 23:38.570
Well, the good news is

23:38.572 --> 23:40.572
nobody can see you.

23:40.574 --> 23:41.640
We have a GPS signal.

23:41.642 --> 23:43.642
Hold on; think
we got you.

23:43.644 --> 23:45.644
Give me topo five, 50
miles in every direction.

23:55.756 --> 23:57.155
So where am I?

23:57.157 --> 23:59.391
Saul, I need you to
calm down and breathe.

23:59.393 --> 24:01.393
I'm fucking breathing.

24:01.395 --> 24:03.962
I usually walk two blocks
to the deli-- it's flat.

24:03.964 --> 24:04.963
Okay.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.132
Quiet now. Sound travels.

24:07.134 --> 24:08.734
Just...

24:10.571 --> 24:12.270
Just tell me what to do.

24:12.272 --> 24:13.639
You said you wanted a break.

24:13.641 --> 24:15.073
Take a look at this.

24:15.075 --> 24:16.241
Makin.

24:16.243 --> 24:17.409
We have an asset here.

24:17.411 --> 24:19.077
Saul?

24:19.079 --> 24:21.279
- Yeah.
- There's a ridgeline up the hill

24:21.281 --> 24:23.215
in front you;
tell me when you're there.

24:25.519 --> 24:27.753
How far out is drone support?

24:27.755 --> 24:29.688
Nearest is 350 miles away.

24:29.690 --> 24:31.356
Reroute them;
we'll want eyes on Makin

24:31.358 --> 24:32.591
in the morning.

24:34.161 --> 24:35.460
Can we get Special
Forces in there?

24:35.462 --> 24:37.929
Far as I know,
the road's passable.

24:37.931 --> 24:40.365
Okay, okay. I'm there.

24:40.367 --> 24:41.633
Good.

24:44.638 --> 24:46.638
Get me out of here.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.373
All right, listen,
we're gonna move you.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.275
Look back the way you came.
To your left, ten o'clock,

24:50.277 --> 24:51.710
you should see lights
on the valley floor.

24:51.712 --> 24:53.211
That's Makin.

24:53.213 --> 24:56.448
We have an asset there.

24:58.852 --> 25:00.218
How far is it?

25:00.220 --> 25:02.020
- Uh, 20 miles.
- Oh, shit.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.622
Oh, God.

25:03.624 --> 25:04.656
No, it's good.

25:04.658 --> 25:06.024
20 miles, come morning,

25:06.026 --> 25:07.559
as far as they know,
could be any direction.

25:07.561 --> 25:09.528
That's 1,500 square miles
they have to cover.

25:09.530 --> 25:11.029
You're a needle in a haystack.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.699
The asset's name is Azam Shah.

25:13.701 --> 25:16.968
He's a grocer in the center
of town, on the Ferozepur Road.

25:16.970 --> 25:19.271
Special Forces will extract
you there. Repeat back to me.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.474
Saul, when we hang up,

25:22.476 --> 25:24.342
we'll be radio silent until
you reach the rendezvous point.

25:24.344 --> 25:26.278
Please repeat
the extraction plan back to me.

25:28.549 --> 25:30.582
Where's Carrie?

25:30.584 --> 25:32.050
Carrie?

25:32.052 --> 25:33.885
Yes, Saul.

25:33.887 --> 25:35.387
I need to talk to you.

25:35.389 --> 25:37.556
Just you and me.

25:44.031 --> 25:46.031
Carrie, you there?

25:46.033 --> 25:48.066
I'm here.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.002
Just us, right?

25:51.839 --> 25:53.839
Just us.

25:53.841 --> 25:55.373
Listen.

25:55.375 --> 25:59.611
I'm not gonna be recaptured
by those people.

25:59.613 --> 26:02.214
Understood--
that's why we're all here.

26:02.216 --> 26:03.915
That's not what
I'm talking about.

26:03.917 --> 26:08.754
I will not be a pawn
in this prisoner exchange.

26:08.756 --> 26:11.957
I will not play Haqqani's game.

26:13.894 --> 26:17.129
No one should suffer
for my mistakes,

26:17.131 --> 26:18.530
let alone a whole country.

26:18.532 --> 26:21.566
Carrie, you hear me?

26:21.568 --> 26:24.035
Yeah.

26:25.906 --> 26:27.606
You need to promise--

26:27.608 --> 26:29.975
something goes wrong, you drop
a bomb on the whole mess.

26:32.479 --> 26:34.746
You know what this exchange plan
is about.

26:34.748 --> 26:37.983
You know it can't happen.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.288
Escape or die, promise me.

26:44.091 --> 26:45.590
Okay.

26:45.592 --> 26:47.425
No.

26:47.427 --> 26:49.094
No, no, no, not "okay."

26:49.096 --> 26:51.663
You need to promise I will not
be allowed to fall back

26:51.665 --> 26:53.298
into the hands of the Taliban,

26:53.300 --> 26:55.567
or, swear to God, I'm stepping
off a cliff right now.

26:57.571 --> 26:59.471
Escape or die.

26:59.473 --> 27:02.073
I promise.

27:02.075 --> 27:05.243
Asset is Azam Shah.

27:05.245 --> 27:09.781
Runs a grocery store
on Ferozepur Road, Makin.

27:09.783 --> 27:12.017
I'm starting now.

27:13.821 --> 27:16.054
Saul?

27:39.313 --> 27:40.812
Saul's almost there.

27:40.814 --> 27:42.447
What's the word
on Special Forces?

27:42.449 --> 27:44.749
About an hour and a half out.

27:46.486 --> 27:48.854
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

27:48.856 --> 27:50.822
You mean what Saul said
to me last night.

27:50.824 --> 27:52.290
Mm-hmm.

27:52.292 --> 27:55.360
He's not gonna allow himself
to be recaptured.

27:55.362 --> 27:57.796
He said take him out
if it comes to that.

27:57.798 --> 27:59.998
Which is exactly
what you said he'd want.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.201
No one wants that.

28:05.005 --> 28:07.172
He made me promise.

28:07.174 --> 28:09.241
<i>If</i> it comes to that.

28:09.243 --> 28:10.742
- Yep.
- Which it won't.

28:10.744 --> 28:14.746
Right. That's what
Special Forces is for.

28:16.550 --> 28:18.316
The Pakistani delegation
just arrived.

28:18.318 --> 28:19.751
You ready?

28:19.753 --> 28:21.653
The ambassador has a list
of questions to present.

28:21.655 --> 28:23.154
A stall, basically.

28:23.156 --> 28:25.891
She figures the entire agenda
will take 20 minutes,

28:25.893 --> 28:27.492
after which we're
back here on Saul.

28:27.494 --> 28:28.927
You think they know?

28:28.929 --> 28:31.062
That their great bargaining
chip has vanished?

28:31.064 --> 28:33.832
Please, they were told
the second he escaped.

28:33.834 --> 28:36.167
It's been a series of calls
with the White House.

28:36.169 --> 28:38.536
You can imagine
the levels of scrutiny.

28:38.538 --> 28:42.040
But I'm sure Mr. Lockhart
will be here shortly.

28:42.042 --> 28:43.875
They know.

28:43.877 --> 28:45.176
What?

28:45.178 --> 28:47.112
- About the pills, they know.
- Calm down.

28:47.114 --> 28:50.181
You told me Carrie Mathison
would be on a plane by now.

28:50.183 --> 28:52.050
She's not.
She's on a rampage,

28:52.052 --> 28:54.452
trying to find out
who fucking poisoned her.

28:54.454 --> 28:57.756
I'm pretty sure she has
other things on her mind.

28:57.758 --> 28:59.557
I need you to do
something for me, Dennis.

28:59.559 --> 29:00.592
Forget it, it's too hot.

29:00.594 --> 29:02.360
It's going to be easy.

29:02.362 --> 29:04.696
Calling it a breach;
that's the word they used.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.437
Oh, here they are.

29:12.439 --> 29:14.706
Sorry for the delay.

29:14.708 --> 29:17.409
We're all ready then.

29:17.411 --> 29:19.144
It can't be
a surprise to anyone

29:19.146 --> 29:21.713
that the White House has
a number of questions about

29:21.715 --> 29:23.982
Haqqani's request
for an exchange of prisoners.

29:23.984 --> 29:27.385
To avoid misunderstanding,
I've itemized them here.

29:28.088 --> 29:30.422
Item one.

29:30.424 --> 29:33.325
The president insists
that proof of life

29:33.327 --> 29:35.794
be provided on a daily basis.

29:35.796 --> 29:37.562
I'm afraid we have
no way to guarantee

29:37.564 --> 29:39.764
daily communications,
Madam Ambassador.

29:39.766 --> 29:42.133
The president
requires daily proof of life

29:42.135 --> 29:43.468
to authorize the release.

29:43.470 --> 29:45.804
I will convey the request.

29:45.806 --> 29:47.839
Next.

29:47.841 --> 29:49.607
Uh, one of the names
on your list...

29:49.609 --> 29:51.009
Not <i> our</i> list.

29:52.679 --> 29:54.846
Of course.

29:54.848 --> 29:55.914
One of the prisoners,

29:55.916 --> 29:57.315
Faysal Ahmad,

29:57.317 --> 29:59.985
is undergoing treatment
for a viral infection.

29:59.987 --> 30:03.955
US medical personnel
estimate he can travel

30:03.957 --> 30:04.990
in three days.

30:04.992 --> 30:06.825
Estimate? _

30:06.827 --> 30:08.426
- Three days.
- Estimate?

30:08.428 --> 30:10.528
That's what I was told.

30:48.902 --> 30:51.669
Hello?

30:51.671 --> 30:53.905
Azam Shah?

30:56.576 --> 30:58.877
Stop.

31:03.717 --> 31:05.583
Who are you?

31:07.421 --> 31:09.387
Didn't they say?

31:09.389 --> 31:11.556
Who?

31:11.558 --> 31:13.591
The Americans.

31:13.592 --> 31:15.391
Shut up.

31:16.396 --> 31:19.563
If you have no idea what I'm
talking about, then shoot me.

31:22.836 --> 31:25.437
But if you do,
I've come for help.

31:33.914 --> 31:35.547
As long as
Mr. Ahmad can walk,

31:35.549 --> 31:38.149
he should be on that transport
with the other exchangees.

31:40.921 --> 31:43.455
Item 7B.

31:43.457 --> 31:45.256
Amir Wasif.

31:48.061 --> 31:50.061
I'm sure that everyone
here is aware

31:50.063 --> 31:53.398
that this name poses
particular challenges.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.733
These challenges...

31:55.735 --> 31:57.402
Excuse me.

31:57.404 --> 31:59.337
These challenges
are only exac...

32:09.983 --> 32:11.816
Carrie.

32:13.386 --> 32:14.953
They know.

32:14.955 --> 32:17.222
They know where Saul is.

32:24.664 --> 32:25.730
That was fast.

32:25.732 --> 32:26.731
It's still going on.

32:26.733 --> 32:27.765
Fuck. Fuck!

32:27.767 --> 32:29.467
What is it?

32:29.469 --> 32:31.169
We've been saying they have
to locate a single human being

32:31.171 --> 32:32.770
in a thousand square miles,
a needle in a haystack,

32:32.772 --> 32:33.805
but that's not true.

32:33.807 --> 32:35.073
They don't have to find Saul.

32:35.075 --> 32:36.808
All they have to do
is find that.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.843
Find us.

32:38.845 --> 32:41.246
We have a drone
directly over Makin.

32:41.248 --> 32:42.981
They not only know
where Saul is,

32:42.983 --> 32:44.649
they know the only direction
help could be coming from.

32:44.651 --> 32:45.650
Check flight operations.

32:45.652 --> 32:47.252
I want to know everything

32:47.254 --> 32:48.686
the Pakistani air force
has been doing since sunrise.

32:48.688 --> 32:50.155
That's why they were
so smug in there.

32:50.157 --> 32:52.323
Five sorties,
all in the border region.

32:52.325 --> 32:53.958
They know.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.727
We've got to get everyone
on the ground a heads up.

32:57.330 --> 32:58.796
Three One Delta.

32:58.798 --> 33:01.099
Three One Delta.
This is Islamabad.

33:01.101 --> 33:02.367
Your position, please.

33:02.369 --> 33:05.203
Three One Delta.
We're closing on M-town.

33:05.205 --> 33:06.971
We're currently four klicks out.

33:06.973 --> 33:09.174
Three One Delta. Repeat, please.

33:10.777 --> 33:12.377
Ah!

33:12.379 --> 33:13.845
Can we do something about this?

33:13.847 --> 33:16.247
Let me see.

33:17.350 --> 33:19.150
Three One Delta. Be advised...

33:37.037 --> 33:38.970
Fuck, back it up.

33:38.972 --> 33:41.206
Looks like
the Taliban are everywhere.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.374
Three One Delta. Wait out.

33:43.376 --> 33:45.910
Rerouting via
raw street Seven Niner.

33:45.912 --> 33:48.213
Say again--
raw street Seven Niner.

33:50.217 --> 33:53.051
It's gonna take them forever.

33:54.054 --> 33:56.354
Haqqani's Taliban,

33:56.356 --> 33:58.723
they showed up five years ago,

33:58.725 --> 34:02.727
making noise about Sharia law,

34:02.729 --> 34:05.230
demanding to see
people's papers,

34:05.232 --> 34:08.833
asking for IDs
they couldn't even read.

34:08.835 --> 34:13.271
When they shut down the school,
it was clear what they wanted--

34:13.273 --> 34:16.674
for us to become like them.

34:17.543 --> 34:19.744
My father...

34:20.914 --> 34:25.216
My father stood up to them.

34:25.217 --> 34:28.353
They placed a mine
outside his house,

34:28.355 --> 34:31.089
under his favorite tree.

34:31.091 --> 34:34.425
When he died,
everyone else backed down.

34:37.630 --> 34:39.130
The next day,
I called the Americans.

34:46.406 --> 34:47.804
Huh?

34:47.806 --> 34:49.306
I need to talk
to your guest, please.

34:52.112 --> 34:54.279
Yeah.

34:54.281 --> 34:55.480
Saul, how you doing?

34:55.482 --> 34:57.682
Well...

34:59.119 --> 35:00.618
Ready to get out of here.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.986
Good.

35:01.988 --> 35:04.122
Uh, there's been
a slight change of plans.

35:04.124 --> 35:05.923
What's wrong?

35:05.925 --> 35:09.460
Nothing. We just want to move
you to the south edge of town,

35:09.462 --> 35:11.262
closer to pickup.
There's too many people;

35:11.264 --> 35:12.630
we don't want you stuck
in the center.

35:12.632 --> 35:13.998
Fine.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.801
There's a hospital
about four streets down.

35:16.803 --> 35:18.703
You can get there by the
alleyway, straight out the back.

35:19.639 --> 35:22.006
Okay.

35:22.008 --> 35:23.741
Behind the hospital, there's
a large park that backs up

35:23.743 --> 35:25.143
to the hills;
we'll meet you there.

35:25.145 --> 35:27.011
I'm on my way.

35:27.013 --> 35:29.113
Keep your phone on;
we need to track you.

35:29.115 --> 35:30.448
They said I should take this.

35:30.450 --> 35:32.250
Good.

35:32.252 --> 35:33.651
You can take that, too.

35:39.092 --> 35:41.092
Thank you.

35:41.094 --> 35:43.361
You're always welcome here.

36:12.925 --> 36:16.381
_

36:18.798 --> 36:21.165
I apologize for my
colleagues' absence.

36:21.167 --> 36:24.669
I'm not sure what's
keeping them.

36:24.671 --> 36:26.838
I wonder if we should
take a formal recess.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.473
No. We'll wait.

36:28.475 --> 36:31.075
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

36:45.425 --> 36:47.225
Islamabad.

36:47.227 --> 36:49.260
Three One Delta.
Hit a roadblock.

36:49.262 --> 36:51.829
Eight enemy. Stand by.

37:19.225 --> 37:21.392
Someone tell me
this isn't happening!

37:21.394 --> 37:23.227
- Keep them coming.
- They got to pull back.

37:23.229 --> 37:24.796
They need to get to town.

37:31.271 --> 37:33.438
Damn it.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.607
Now, where did
these guys come from?

37:38.711 --> 37:41.012
Fuck.

37:42.882 --> 37:44.782
Okay, I want these guys
tagged, all of them.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.083
We have to track where they go.

37:46.085 --> 37:48.219
Yes, ma'am,
I'm tagging them now.

37:50.757 --> 37:52.490
Get me Saul.

37:52.492 --> 37:54.058
Yeah.

37:54.060 --> 37:55.626
Saul?

37:55.628 --> 37:57.428
I need to redirect you slightly.

37:57.430 --> 37:59.597
Turn right... now.

37:59.599 --> 38:01.799
Okay, good.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.935
Something wrong?

38:03.937 --> 38:05.336
Uh, no.

38:12.479 --> 38:14.745
Carrie, what's going on?

38:16.015 --> 38:19.083
We're seeing some
Taliban presence in town.

38:19.085 --> 38:21.419
Not some.

38:21.421 --> 38:22.420
A lot.

38:28.795 --> 38:30.194
And they're searching.

38:34.501 --> 38:36.033
Uh, hold on one second.

38:36.035 --> 38:38.002
Tag these.

38:45.678 --> 38:47.378
Carrie...

38:50.183 --> 38:52.049
they know I'm here.

38:54.153 --> 38:56.354
There are too many of them.

38:56.356 --> 38:58.189
I can't get through.

38:58.191 --> 39:00.324
Just hang tight.

39:00.326 --> 39:01.626
It's not that bad.

39:01.628 --> 39:02.860
You got to trust me.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.395
I've got the big picture here.

39:06.199 --> 39:07.798
Okay.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.300
Now listen carefully.

39:09.302 --> 39:11.802
No.

39:12.972 --> 39:14.639
What are you doing?

39:14.641 --> 39:16.007
What we said.

39:16.009 --> 39:17.909
No, you have to keep moving.

39:17.911 --> 39:21.312
I will not go back
to those people, Carrie.

39:21.314 --> 39:23.047
Saul, we're almost there.

39:25.351 --> 39:27.985
I had a good run of it.

39:27.987 --> 39:29.487
No, no! Saul!
What are you doing?

39:29.489 --> 39:30.988
You've got to listen to me.
It's not over.

39:30.990 --> 39:32.356
They're everywhere.

39:32.358 --> 39:34.692
You must see them.

39:34.694 --> 39:36.727
Too many.

39:37.730 --> 39:39.564
No! I'm here!

39:39.566 --> 39:41.332
I'm here in the ops room.

39:41.334 --> 39:44.201
I am looking at the screen
and I am telling you

39:44.203 --> 39:46.370
it is not hopeless.

39:46.372 --> 39:47.939
There is a way.

39:48.708 --> 39:50.274
Saul?

39:51.444 --> 39:53.778
Saul, we will thread the needle,
you and I.

39:53.780 --> 39:55.212
We will get you home,

39:55.214 --> 39:58.182
but you need to put
that gun down and focus.

39:58.184 --> 40:00.685
You need to do
exactly what I say.

40:06.092 --> 40:07.758
Saul?

40:14.200 --> 40:17.435
Saul?

40:17.437 --> 40:19.136
- Where are Special Forces?
- They're not coming.

40:19.138 --> 40:20.438
- Turn them around.
- We can't.

40:26.112 --> 40:28.079
Saul, they're waiting
for you at the rendezvous.

40:28.081 --> 40:30.214
Don't let them down.

40:51.471 --> 40:54.939
Saul, you're in a courtyard.

40:54.941 --> 40:56.841
You need to exit it now.

41:10.590 --> 41:13.190
He's moving.

41:16.629 --> 41:18.529
Okay.

41:18.531 --> 41:21.265
So, at the alleyway,
you're gonna take a right.

41:24.103 --> 41:26.504
That's the way I came.

41:26.506 --> 41:29.073
Well, we're gonna retrace
your steps a bit.

41:30.877 --> 41:32.510
What now?

41:32.512 --> 41:33.944
Uh, up ahead,

41:33.946 --> 41:37.148
there's, uh...
one, two, three buildings.

41:37.150 --> 41:39.817
Veer left.

41:39.819 --> 41:41.786
Carrie...

41:42.889 --> 41:44.321
Don't worry, I see them.

41:44.323 --> 41:46.390
There-there should be
a door to your left.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.127
It's locked.

41:50.129 --> 41:51.462
Try the next one.

41:52.298 --> 41:54.565
No good.

41:58.337 --> 41:59.837
Okay, okay, I'm in.

41:59.839 --> 42:01.906
Keep moving.

42:01.908 --> 42:03.674
You're looking for an exit
across the building.

42:03.676 --> 42:04.709
Where?

42:04.711 --> 42:06.210
Uh, t-to your left

42:06.212 --> 42:07.845
and then your, uh, then
your right, probably.

42:07.847 --> 42:09.413
I see one.

42:09.415 --> 42:10.881
Good. That'll take you

42:10.883 --> 42:14.018
out to a street,
and the park is two blocks away.

42:14.020 --> 42:15.486
Okay.

42:15.488 --> 42:16.487
Just keep moving.

42:16.489 --> 42:17.888
I am.

42:20.059 --> 42:21.025
Carrie!

42:29.702 --> 42:32.069
Help me!

42:32.071 --> 42:34.605
Carrie! Get off of me!

42:34.607 --> 42:37.541
You fucking lied to me!
Goddamn you!

42:37.543 --> 42:39.276
You fucking lied!

42:39.278 --> 42:41.378
You fucking lied to me!

42:41.380 --> 42:43.748
Fuck you! Fuck you!

42:43.750 --> 42:46.283
Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

42:46.285 --> 42:47.852
You fucking lied to me!

42:49.622 --> 42:52.189
Oh, goddamn you! Goddamn you!

42:52.191 --> 42:54.358
Just... turn it off.

42:56.863 --> 42:59.630
I think I'll go back
to the conference room.

43:05.438 --> 43:06.904
I was really looking forward

43:06.906 --> 43:09.306
to telling those people
to go fuck themselves.

43:11.077 --> 43:12.877
But I don't see
that happening now.

43:43.142 --> 43:46.010
Tell Haqqani
we'll meet his demands.

44:08.601 --> 44:11.268
I was trying to do
the right thing for once.

44:11.270 --> 44:13.838
I was trying to keep
someone alive, instead of...

44:13.840 --> 44:17.174
steering them to their death.

44:18.945 --> 44:21.645
Which you did.

44:21.647 --> 44:24.381
I don't know what I did.

44:24.383 --> 44:25.983
I betrayed Saul.

44:25.985 --> 44:30.087
He was counting on me,
and I betrayed him.

44:33.159 --> 44:34.792
I mean, how...

44:34.794 --> 44:36.727
how could saving someone's life
be the wrong choice?

44:36.729 --> 44:39.330
But it was, because there
are only wrong choices.

44:39.332 --> 44:41.532
And it's like I'm-I'm finally...

44:41.534 --> 44:43.701
seeing it now
for the first time.

44:43.703 --> 44:45.636
Nothing good can happen

44:45.638 --> 44:49.406
in this fucked-up world
that we've made for ourselves.

44:49.408 --> 44:50.975
Can it?

44:56.749 --> 45:00.084
We've been up for two days.

45:00.086 --> 45:03.220
I think...

45:03.222 --> 45:05.856
we could both use some rest.

45:05.858 --> 45:08.092
Good night.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.320
Well, you won.

46:43.322 --> 46:45.956
Did we?

46:45.958 --> 46:48.726
You said you had
something to tell me.

46:52.131 --> 46:54.798
What happened to you
the other night with the drugs,

46:54.800 --> 46:56.433
it wasn't me.

46:58.204 --> 47:00.371
- You said that already.
- I know.

47:00.373 --> 47:01.338
More than once.

47:01.340 --> 47:02.606
I need you to believe me.

47:02.608 --> 47:04.508
Why?

47:04.510 --> 47:06.543
I'm not sure.

47:06.545 --> 47:08.879
Maybe because it's true.

47:10.716 --> 47:13.217
You make everything so hard,

47:13.219 --> 47:14.485
you know that?

47:14.487 --> 47:15.986
Next time you complain

47:15.988 --> 47:18.722
about the distrust between us,
you remember this.

47:18.724 --> 47:19.957
Right now.

47:22.395 --> 47:25.863
That was fucked-up,
what they did to me.

47:31.003 --> 47:32.703
And-and maybe it was fair;

47:32.705 --> 47:37.141
maybe it's what we do to each
other all the time, but...

47:37.143 --> 47:39.343
it didn't feel fair.

47:39.345 --> 47:41.745
Not at all.

47:45.885 --> 47:48.118
I believe you though.

48:02.368 --> 48:05.903
I know you're telling
the truth, because...

48:08.941 --> 48:12.176
I remember.

48:12.178 --> 48:15.379
Not...

48:15.381 --> 48:18.315
not everything, but enough.

48:22.221 --> 48:24.788
The part at the end with you.

48:32.131 --> 48:33.730
But you can't do this.

48:33.732 --> 48:35.365
You can't tell me you have
something important...

48:35.367 --> 48:38.635
It was Dennis Boyd
who switched your pills.

48:39.438 --> 48:42.406
The ambassador's husband.

48:42.408 --> 48:45.642
He's working against you.

48:50.883 --> 48:54.384
That's all I can say.
