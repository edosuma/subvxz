WEBVTT

00:10.458 --> 00:12.625
- [laughs]

00:10.458 --> 00:12.625
I can't believe

00:12.667 --> 00:14.291
you think<i> Snuggle Squirrels One</i>

00:14.333 --> 00:16.500
is better than

00:14.333 --> 00:16.500
<i>Snuggle Squirrels Two.</i>

00:16.542 --> 00:19.333
- I just think

00:16.542 --> 00:19.333
the snuggling is more believable

00:19.375 --> 00:21.458
in the original.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.875
- What about the third one?

00:22.917 --> 00:27.333
<i>The Empire Snuggles Back.</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:29.250
- I'm not discussing this

00:27.375 --> 00:29.250
with any of you

00:29.291 --> 00:33.834
until you read the books.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.417
- No, no, no.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.542
The worst zombie movie ever

00:35.458 --> 00:37.542
is<i> Zombabes.</i>

00:37.583 --> 00:39.959
- I know.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.959
So lame.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.083
Zombies aren't supposed to

00:40.000 --> 00:43.083
go to beach parties...or surf.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.917
[both groaning]

00:45.959 --> 00:47.458
Give me the classic...

00:47.500 --> 00:49.750
"Must eat brains!"

00:49.792 --> 00:52.083
- Rwar!

00:49.792 --> 00:52.083
- Raaaahhh!

00:52.125 --> 00:53.875
- Oh.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.875
Maybe we shouldn't be

00:53.917 --> 00:55.333
talking about this stuff

00:53.917 --> 00:55.333
in front of

00:55.375 --> 00:56.750
- [whispers] Kids.

00:55.375 --> 00:56.750
- [whispers] Yeah.

00:56.792 --> 00:58.583
- Who, us?

00:58.625 --> 01:00.709
Whaaaaat?

01:00.750 --> 01:03.417
We watch scary movies

01:00.750 --> 01:03.417
all the time.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.417
What else would we watch...

01:05.458 --> 01:06.709
<i>Snuggle Squirrels?</i>

01:05.458 --> 01:06.709
- Pfft!

01:06.750 --> 01:08.917
- Yeah.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.917
- I'm a snuggle squirrel!

01:08.959 --> 01:10.917
- Who are you to judge us?

01:10.959 --> 01:13.667
- Then you must be

01:10.959 --> 01:13.667
really excited for tonight.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.959
- Sure.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.959
Mom's meatloaf.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.875
She adds paprika.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.875
It's a winner.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.291
- She's talking about

01:19.917 --> 01:22.291
<i>Field of Brains...</i>

01:22.333 --> 01:24.583
the scariest

01:22.333 --> 01:24.583
classic zombie movie ever.

01:24.625 --> 01:25.959
It's on TV tonight.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.542
Uncut.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.542
Unrated.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.250
- And unbelievably scary!

01:30.291 --> 01:31.375
[laughs]

01:30.291 --> 01:31.375
- Mm.

01:31.417 --> 01:33.875
- See you tonight.

01:31.417 --> 01:33.875
- Uh...

01:33.917 --> 01:37.500
Obviously, we're watching

01:33.917 --> 01:37.500
<i>Field of Brains</i> tonight.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.083
Duh!

01:39.125 --> 01:41.000
- Guys.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.750
You don't have to pretend.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.208
We all know you're too young

01:42.792 --> 01:45.208
for scary movies.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.625
And by the way...

01:46.667 --> 01:49.291
the snuggle squirrels

01:46.667 --> 01:49.291
are adorable.

01:49.333 --> 01:50.458
Like you guys.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.667
- Did you hear that?

01:56.709 --> 01:57.625
- Yeah.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.333
She called me adorable.

02:00.375 --> 02:05.083
Our, "will they, won't they?"

02:00.375 --> 02:05.083
tension is electric.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.500
- She called us too young.

02:07.542 --> 02:10.583
That is the worst type of young.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.083
- She's right, though.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.667
We've never really seen

02:12.125 --> 02:14.667
a scary movie.

02:14.709 --> 02:16.208
- Well, that ends tonight.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.417
We are watching<i> Field of Brains.</i>

02:18.458 --> 02:20.917
- I will be up here

02:18.458 --> 02:20.917
for one week,

02:20.959 --> 02:23.500
living on nothing but grit...

02:23.542 --> 02:24.792
determination...

02:24.834 --> 02:27.417
and the sweat from my socks.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.333
- All while promoting the

02:27.458 --> 02:29.333
affordably-priced camping gear

02:29.375 --> 02:31.375
here at Tom's Get Sporty.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.375
[laughs]

02:31.417 --> 02:33.542
- I'm not here to

02:31.417 --> 02:33.542
move tents, Harper.

02:33.583 --> 02:35.417
Grizz Coyote's no sellout.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.667
[applause]

02:38.709 --> 02:40.041
- Grizz is so rugged.

02:40.083 --> 02:42.333
He can survive anything.

02:40.083 --> 02:42.333
- I know.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.125
I kinda hope a mountain lion

02:42.375 --> 02:44.125
gets loose in the store,

02:44.166 --> 02:46.417
just to see what happens.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.417
- [laughs]

02:46.458 --> 02:48.375
- Wow.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.375
You guys are in a good mood.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.291
- Sure are.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.125
- So, now would be a good time

02:50.333 --> 02:53.125
to ask you something?

02:50.333 --> 02:53.125
- Anything you want.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.500
- Can we watch

02:53.166 --> 02:54.500
<i>Field of Brains</i> tonight?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.125
Both: No way.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.125
- What?

02:56.166 --> 02:57.834
- You're not watching

02:56.166 --> 02:57.834
a zombie movie.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.000
- Why not?

02:57.875 --> 03:00.000
- Because we've seen it.

03:00.041 --> 03:02.208
In a world

03:00.041 --> 03:02.208
where zombies eat farmers

03:02.250 --> 03:03.750
and harvest their brains.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.500
- Four kids

03:03.792 --> 03:05.500
will not see that movie

03:05.542 --> 03:08.125
because they are too young.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.834
- You guys are so mean.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.625
- We're not mean.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.625
We're good parents.

03:11.667 --> 03:12.792
There are

03:11.667 --> 03:12.792
certain disturbing images

03:12.834 --> 03:14.417
we don't want you exposed to.

03:14.458 --> 03:17.250
- [spits]

03:17.291 --> 03:18.875
- Kids, look.

03:17.291 --> 03:18.875
Grizz is treating an open wound

03:18.917 --> 03:20.875
with just

03:18.917 --> 03:20.875
his toenails and phlegm.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.458
- In a world...

03:26.500 --> 03:29.166
where parents are

03:26.500 --> 03:29.166
overprotective...

03:29.208 --> 03:33.959
four kids watch

03:29.208 --> 03:33.959
<i>Field of Brains</i> anyway.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.542
- I wish we were those kids.

- Excuse me, Mr. Coyote.

04:23.041 --> 04:26.166
We have

04:23.041 --> 04:26.166
a hypothetical question for you.

04:26.208 --> 04:29.333
- Is it: Can a man walk

04:26.208 --> 04:29.333
barefoot across Alaska?

04:29.375 --> 04:33.166
Because yes.

04:29.375 --> 04:33.166
I did that.

04:33.208 --> 04:37.166
- Our question is about putting

04:33.208 --> 04:37.166
two bears to bed so we could--

04:37.208 --> 04:39.250
I don't know--

04:37.208 --> 04:39.250
watch a movie or something.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.041
- We talking polar?

04:39.291 --> 04:42.041
Kodiak?

04:42.083 --> 04:44.000
Panda?

04:42.083 --> 04:44.000
- Mama.

04:44.041 --> 04:46.875
About yay tall

04:44.041 --> 04:46.875
with blonde hair.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.375
- And a 6' papa bear

04:46.917 --> 04:49.375
with a sort of

04:49.417 --> 04:51.625
balding Jim Carrey look.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.542
- Exotic species.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.250
Do you have access to

04:53.583 --> 04:56.250
any spears or grenades?

04:56.291 --> 04:58.959
- No, we just want to

04:56.291 --> 04:58.959
help them fall asleep.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.834
- All right, since

04:59.000 --> 05:01.834
you don't have any grenades...

05:01.875 --> 05:05.208
I would recommend a relaxing

05:01.875 --> 05:05.208
atmosphere and a filling meal.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.583
Turkey.

05:06.625 --> 05:07.709
Thick, heavy gravy.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.291
Mac and cheese.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.917
Maybe a pie.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.166
- You've fed that stuff

05:11.959 --> 05:14.166
to bears?

05:14.208 --> 05:18.250
- No. But it puts my Uncle Jerry

05:14.208 --> 05:18.250
to sleep every Thanksgiving.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.500
And he's pretty hairy, so...

05:20.542 --> 05:21.792
- Hey, guys.

05:20.542 --> 05:21.792
What's up?

05:21.834 --> 05:23.583
- You guys getting

05:21.834 --> 05:23.583
grizzy with it?

05:23.625 --> 05:25.375
- Yeah, we're gonna go home

05:23.625 --> 05:25.375
and floss with our shoes.

05:25.417 --> 05:28.000
- See ya.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.125
- Hey, Grizz.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.291
Camping sales are way up.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.625
People love tough guys

05:31.333 --> 05:33.625
like you and me.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.166
- You and me?

05:35.208 --> 05:38.041
Have you ever

05:35.208 --> 05:38.041
throat-punched a giraffe

05:38.083 --> 05:40.542
'cause he was

05:38.083 --> 05:40.542
eating off your branch?

05:40.583 --> 05:43.041
Have you ever let

05:40.583 --> 05:43.041
an anaconda swallow you

05:43.083 --> 05:45.792
so you'd have

05:43.083 --> 05:45.792
a warm place to sleep?

05:45.834 --> 05:47.291
- [clears throat]

05:47.333 --> 05:49.166
See that scar?

05:49.208 --> 05:51.333
I got that last year

05:49.208 --> 05:51.333
living in the woods.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.667
- In a luxury cabin in Aspen.

05:53.709 --> 05:56.583
He punched a mini-fridge when

05:53.709 --> 05:56.583
he realized there was no Wi-Fi.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.583
- [laughs]

05:56.625 --> 05:59.583
Okay, as I recall,

05:56.625 --> 05:59.583
someone wouldn't eat s'mores

05:59.625 --> 06:01.333
because the marshmallows

05:59.625 --> 06:01.333
touched stick.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.333
- Those sticks were

06:01.375 --> 06:03.333
on the ground.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.750
- They fell from a tree.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.750
That's where sticks land.

06:05.792 --> 06:08.166
- Please!

06:08.208 --> 06:11.041
Civilians like you

06:08.208 --> 06:11.041
could never live off the land.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.375
You sell the survival lifestyle.

06:13.417 --> 06:14.875
I live it.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.250
You want to know what tough is?

06:16.291 --> 06:19.291
You should read my man-oirs.

06:19.333 --> 06:22.875
Which I wrote entirely

06:19.333 --> 06:22.875
on the hide of a rhinoceros.

06:22.917 --> 06:28.291
You know how hard it is to get

06:22.917 --> 06:28.291
a rhino to hold still that long?

06:28.333 --> 06:30.041
Now if you'll excuse me...

06:30.083 --> 06:31.542
it's lunchtime.

06:37.834 --> 06:38.875
- Is he right?

06:38.917 --> 06:40.333
Have we gone soft?

06:40.375 --> 06:41.875
- No, no, no.

06:40.375 --> 06:41.875
We're still tough.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.834
We don't need that book.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.875
- Mr. And Mrs. Harper!

06:45.917 --> 06:48.875
Your walk-no-mores have arrived.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.125
- Yes!

06:48.917 --> 06:50.125
Finally, getting the mail

06:50.166 --> 06:54.041
won't be so exhausting.

06:50.166 --> 06:54.041
[laughs]

06:54.083 --> 07:01.792
- Okay, maybe we need to

06:54.083 --> 07:01.792
read the book.

06:54.083 --> 07:01.792
- Yeah.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.166
Do you smell turkey?

07:03.208 --> 07:04.625
- Yeah.

07:03.208 --> 07:04.625
- Huh.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.750
- Oh. Oh.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.750
You know, according to Grizz...

07:07.792 --> 07:09.709
that means either

07:07.792 --> 07:09.709
an avalanche is coming...

07:09.750 --> 07:12.500
- Okay.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.500
- Or someone's cooking turkey.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.959
- But it's meatloaf night.

07:15.000 --> 07:15.917
- Kids!

07:15.959 --> 07:17.959
Avalanche!

07:18.041 --> 07:20.750
Oh.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.750
False alarm.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.959
It was turkey.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.667
- Welcome, parents.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.083
Please sit.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.166
- What's going on in here?

07:27.208 --> 07:28.917
- We made you dinner.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.875
- But what about my meatloaf?

07:30.917 --> 07:32.375
- We're shaking things up.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.291
Tonight, we're having turkey

07:34.333 --> 07:37.709
covered in a thick, heavy gravy.

07:37.750 --> 07:42.291
- Followed by more turkey,

07:37.750 --> 07:42.291
also with thick, heavy gravy.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.333
- And for

07:42.333 --> 07:44.333
your dining entertainment,

07:44.375 --> 07:49.291
I'll be reading from

07:44.375 --> 07:49.291
a thick, heavy book.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.208
<i>Doorknobs:</i>

07:49.333 --> 07:52.208
<i>A Complete History.</i>

07:52.250 --> 07:54.083
- Are you guys trying to

07:52.250 --> 07:54.083
put us to sleep?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.750
[laughter]

07:56.792 --> 07:59.041
- Chapter one.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.166
- More thick, heavy gravy?

08:04.834 --> 08:06.625
- Would you kids mind if we--

08:04.834 --> 08:06.625
[yawns]

08:06.667 --> 08:08.625
If we, uh...

08:06.667 --> 08:08.625
- If you went to bed?

08:08.667 --> 08:10.625
Not at all.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.208
Good night.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.959
- Love you.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.959
- Sweet dreams.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.166
- Have a great sleep.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.166
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.583
- Love you guys.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.583
- Good night.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.375
- Good night.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.834
- It's zombie time.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.250
All: Rwar!

08:29.250 --> 08:32.667
- And now...

08:29.250 --> 08:32.667
<i>Field of Brains.</i>

08:32.709 --> 08:34.333
- I've been dreaming about

08:32.709 --> 08:34.333
seeing this movie

08:34.375 --> 08:37.250
for as long as I can remember.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.125
- You mean since this morning?

08:39.166 --> 08:41.291
- Yeah.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.291
Like I said.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.041
- Shh.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.041
The movie's starting.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.709
- "Based on actual events"?

08:45.750 --> 08:47.208
Interesting.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.792
Man: Family?

08:47.250 --> 08:49.792
I've returned from farming.

08:49.834 --> 08:53.000
Boy: Welcome home, Papa.

08:49.834 --> 08:53.000
Did you harvest any corn today?

08:53.041 --> 08:55.166
- Sure did, son.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.166
Sure did.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.500
- This isn't scary.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.000
- Yeah, it's just a nice family

08:58.041 --> 08:59.500
living on a farm

08:58.041 --> 08:59.500
in the middle of nowhere

08:59.542 --> 09:02.291
with no neighbors or police

08:59.542 --> 09:02.291
for miles.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.458
- I don't see how

09:02.333 --> 09:05.458
this could go wrong.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.000
Man: I'm gonna check

09:05.500 --> 09:07.000
the basement

09:07.041 --> 09:09.792
to see if the furnace

09:07.041 --> 09:09.792
is still acting up.

09:09.834 --> 09:10.917
[hinges creaking]

09:10.959 --> 09:12.291
- Ooh.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.291
Ooh!

09:12.333 --> 09:14.208
Look at that doorknob.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.792
That's a rare 1937 lock

09:14.250 --> 09:17.792
and slide with Amish movement.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.917
All: Shh!

09:19.959 --> 09:23.500
- Whoo-hoo!

09:19.959 --> 09:23.500
Sure is dark down here.

09:23.542 --> 09:27.125
- [growling]

09:23.542 --> 09:27.125
- Aah!

09:27.166 --> 09:29.583
- It went so wrong so quickly!

09:38.041 --> 09:39.041
- [stomach gurgles]

09:39.083 --> 09:42.375
- Oh...

09:42.417 --> 09:43.709
Tom, are you okay?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.667
- Ah.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.667
I think the kids'...

09:46.709 --> 09:48.792
thick, heavy gravy...

09:48.834 --> 09:50.333
might've hurt my stomach.

09:50.375 --> 09:54.208
Grizz is right.

09:50.375 --> 09:54.208
We have gone soft.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.375
- What do you mean "we"?

09:55.417 --> 09:57.250
My stomach is just fine.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.834
[stomach gurgles]

09:58.875 --> 10:00.709
Whoa.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.291
Okay, that is not

10:00.750 --> 10:03.291
a sign of softness.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.208
That is the call of the wild.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.291
- It sounds like

10:05.250 --> 10:07.291
a call for help.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.917
And a true survivalist

10:07.333 --> 10:09.917
doesn't call for help.

10:09.959 --> 10:13.667
We play through...

10:09.959 --> 10:13.667
[stomach gurgles]

10:13.709 --> 10:15.333
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

10:13.709 --> 10:15.333
Are you suggesting

10:15.375 --> 10:17.625
that you are more of

10:15.375 --> 10:17.625
a true survivalist than me?

10:17.667 --> 10:20.000
- Well, I don't want to

10:17.667 --> 10:20.000
toot my own horn, but...

10:20.041 --> 10:21.625
Honk honk.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.375
- Please!

10:21.667 --> 10:23.375
I am definitely

10:23.417 --> 10:24.375
more of a survivalist

10:23.417 --> 10:24.375
than you.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.875
Honk honk.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.834
- I could live outside

10:25.917 --> 10:27.834
for a week--honk.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.917
- I could live outside

10:27.875 --> 10:29.917
for a month--honk.

10:29.959 --> 10:32.625
- I could live outside

10:29.959 --> 10:32.625
right now.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.959
No honk necessary.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.917
Oh, yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.917
This is happening.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.709
- Oh, what,

10:37.959 --> 10:39.709
pillows and a blanket?

10:39.750 --> 10:41.625
What, are you staying

10:39.750 --> 10:41.625
at the Queen's house?

10:41.667 --> 10:43.792
Give me the cold grass, baby.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.458
- Grass?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.083
Oh, your majesty!

10:47.125 --> 10:50.166
I'll take the hard dirt.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.375
- I hope it rains.

10:51.417 --> 10:55.417
- I hope it snows!

10:55.458 --> 10:56.500
- Honk!

10:56.542 --> 10:57.834
Honk.

10:56.542 --> 10:57.834
Ow!

Ah-ooga!

10:59.083 --> 11:01.417

- Why are we still

11:01.458 --> 11:03.375
watching this?

11:03.417 --> 11:05.750
- I'm too scared

11:03.417 --> 11:05.750
to turn it off.

11:05.792 --> 11:07.458
- We have to keep watching.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.000
It's what the big kids do.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.000

15:00.792 --> 15:01.917
- Did you buy the chalkboard?

15:01.959 --> 15:04.792
- Forget the chalkboard.

15:04.834 --> 15:08.750
Mom and Dad are just starting

15:04.834 --> 15:08.750
zombification process.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.250
If this is about

15:08.792 --> 15:11.250
the chalkboard...

15:13.792 --> 15:16.375
It's just like in the movie.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.417
- Stage one...

15:18.458 --> 15:21.166
moaning and night walking.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.333
Stage two...

15:23.375 --> 15:25.500
digging holes.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.208
- They're already on

15:25.542 --> 15:27.208
stage three.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.500
- No, digging is stage two.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.792
- Really?

15:29.542 --> 15:31.792
That's a shovel?

15:31.834 --> 15:34.667
- I thought he was trying

15:31.834 --> 15:34.667
to wood-fire a pizza.

15:36.458 --> 15:39.542
[distant growling, groaning]

15:39.583 --> 15:41.125
- We don't have much time.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.458
The next stage is

15:41.166 --> 15:43.458
sensitivity to light.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.542
Then...

15:43.500 --> 15:47.542
the final stage.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.208
They eat brains!

15:49.250 --> 15:50.750
- What do we do?

15:50.792 --> 15:52.750
- Well, according to

15:50.792 --> 15:52.750
Professor Feldstein...

15:52.792 --> 15:54.709
- There is an antidote.

15:54.750 --> 15:59.041
But it must be administered

15:54.750 --> 15:59.041
before stage four.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.875
If not, they will become...

16:01.917 --> 16:03.041
full...

16:03.083 --> 16:04.291

16:04.333 --> 16:05.834

16:04.333 --> 16:05.834
[voice echoes]

16:07.542 --> 16:09.709
- Any questions?

16:09.750 --> 16:11.417
I found the chalkboard

16:09.750 --> 16:11.417
in the attic.

16:11.458 --> 16:12.834
- Thank you!

16:17.083 --> 16:21.083
- And a dirty sock.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.959
- Ugh,

16:21.125 --> 16:23.959
that antidote smells disgusting.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.333
- Did you really think that

16:24.000 --> 16:26.333
dirty socks, toilet water,

16:26.375 --> 16:29.417
bellybutton lint, dead flies,

16:26.375 --> 16:29.417
moldy cottage cheese,

16:29.458 --> 16:32.000
dental floss gunk,

16:29.458 --> 16:32.000
and a sprig of dill

16:32.041 --> 16:33.458
was gonna smell good?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.834
- I thought the dill would

16:33.500 --> 16:35.834
jazz it up.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.208
- How are we supposed to get

16:35.875 --> 16:38.208
Mom and Dad to drink...

16:38.250 --> 16:42.041
this?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.500
- We don't.

16:43.542 --> 16:45.834
We pour the antidote

16:43.542 --> 16:45.834
into their shoes.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.667
It has to enter

16:45.875 --> 16:47.667
through their soles...

16:47.709 --> 16:49.583
to save their souls.

16:49.625 --> 16:53.458
- That's deep, bro-fessor.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.208
- So, which one of you

16:53.500 --> 16:55.208
brave men

16:55.250 --> 16:58.542
wants to go downstairs

16:55.250 --> 16:58.542
and put it in their shoes?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.250
So, which one of you brave men

17:00.291 --> 17:02.250
wants to take their fingernails

17:00.291 --> 17:02.250
out of my back?

17:02.291 --> 17:04.250
Boys: Sorry.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.875
- Come on.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.875
We gotta find their shoes.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.709
- I don't see them.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.291
- Uh, let's check the back

17:08.750 --> 17:10.291
door.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.542
- What if they come in?

17:11.583 --> 17:13.375
- They won't,

17:11.583 --> 17:13.375
as long as the lights are on.

17:13.417 --> 17:15.667
[both groaning]

17:15.709 --> 17:16.750
[electricity crackles]

17:15.709 --> 17:16.750
- Oh.

17:16.792 --> 17:18.875
Uh-oh.

17:18.917 --> 17:20.458
That sounded like

17:18.917 --> 17:20.458
something important.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.792
Both: Oh!

17:22.834 --> 17:23.917
- Definitely

17:22.834 --> 17:23.917
something important.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.750
- Aah!

17:30.250 --> 17:31.917
- Well, at least it's just us.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.917
- Huh.

17:36.667 --> 17:39.417
We should probably go inside

17:36.667 --> 17:39.417
and call the power company.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.083
Anonymously.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.834
- That's exactly

17:41.125 --> 17:42.834
what Grizz would do.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.583
- Yeah.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.041
- Ah!

17:44.625 --> 17:46.041
- Oh!

17:46.083 --> 17:47.291
Stepped in a hole!

- Ohhhhhhh!

17:54.709 --> 17:57.041
- Sprains.

- S'rains!

17:57.083 --> 18:00.333
[both groaning]

18:00.375 --> 18:02.417

18:00.375 --> 18:02.417
- S'rains...

18:02.458 --> 18:04.875
- Ooh.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.625
- What are they doing?

18:06.667 --> 18:08.834
- I think

18:06.667 --> 18:08.834
they're sitting down to eat.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.875
- Oh, no.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.875
They've reached stage four.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.000
They're hungry for brains.

18:14.041 --> 18:17.417
- [lisping]

18:14.041 --> 18:17.417
My tongue is on fire!

- Oh, stains!

18:18.959 --> 18:22.542
- Ugh!

18:22.583 --> 18:25.000
- Quick--we have to get

18:22.583 --> 18:25.000
the antidote in their shoes.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.583
- Aah!

18:28.625 --> 18:30.125
- Huh?

18:31.417 --> 18:33.166
Huh?

18:31.417 --> 18:33.166
- Uhh?

Ehhhh....

18:38.583 --> 18:41.250
- Nooooo!

18:41.291 --> 18:43.792
- They got Ricky!

18:41.291 --> 18:43.792
Should we save him?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.959
Sorry, Ricky!

18:53.458 --> 18:55.000
- Go, go, go.

18:57.041 --> 19:00.875
[panting]

18:57.041 --> 19:00.875
We lost Ricky.

19:00.917 --> 19:02.333
- He's one of them now.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.625
- I call his computer.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.166
- We need to find Grizz.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.583
He'll know what to do.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.583
He can survive anything.

19:11.625 --> 19:12.792
- Gah!

19:12.834 --> 19:14.208
- Aah!

Aah!

19:58.458 --> 20:01.667
Don't eat my brains.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.959
Why aren't you eating my brains?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.250
- Because I'm not a zombie.

20:42.417 --> 20:46.041
you couldn't watch that movie

because we knew it would get in

They actually think

21:43.542 --> 21:46.333
we're not zombies.

- I can't wait

21:46.375 --> 21:48.083
till they fall asleep
