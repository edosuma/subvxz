01:39.650 --> 01:41.108
Mm.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.858
<i>Alert, biodome breach.</i>

03:13.942 --> 03:16.692
<i>Alert, biodome breach.</i>

03:19.192 --> 03:21.525
Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

03:21.608 --> 03:23.775
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

03:23.858 --> 03:26.192
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

03:26.275 --> 03:28.733
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.817
If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.317
There can't be
two alpha Titans.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.275
The whole theory
of an ancient rivalry

03:35.358 --> 03:36.817
stems from Iwi mythology.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.192
He's gotten too big over time.

03:38.275 --> 03:40.067
This environment
won't sustain much longer.

03:40.150 --> 03:41.608
It's too unstable.

03:44.817 --> 03:46.192
Hey.

03:58.733 --> 04:00.900
Off-site would be
a death sentence.

04:00.983 --> 04:04.233
You don't think the King
could take care of himself?

04:04.317 --> 04:06.358
There has to be another way.

04:15.025 --> 04:16.942
<i>Finding the origin
of these creatures</i>

04:17.024 --> 04:20.983
<i>is essential
to mankind's survival.</i>

04:21.067 --> 04:22.608
<i>The interior
of the Earth</i>

04:22.692 --> 04:25.442
<i>is made up of vast cabins
and air pockets,</i>

04:26.400 --> 04:30.108
<i>joined by natural avenues.</i>

04:30.192 --> 04:32.483
<i>The admiral
begins his expedition,</i>

04:32.567 --> 04:35.025
<i>searching for an entrance
to a hidden world.</i>

04:35.108 --> 04:36.692
<i>The purpose
is the discovery</i>

04:36.775 --> 04:38.192
<i>and the release to the world</i>

04:38.275 --> 04:40.317
<i>of the unknown treasures
of Antarctica</i>

04:40.400 --> 04:43.858
<i>in the interests
of all mankind.</i>

04:43.942 --> 04:47.025
<i>Members of the lost
party were never seen again.</i>

04:47.108 --> 04:49.442
<i>Still no word
on what may have happened.</i>

04:54.400 --> 04:56.150
<i>There's an ecosystem
out there,</i>

04:56.233 --> 04:58.567
<i>the likes of which
we can't imagine.</i>

04:58.650 --> 05:01.650
<i>And the place to find it
is this island.</i>

06:29.775 --> 06:31.067
<i>Hello, loyal listeners.</i>

06:31.150 --> 06:33.233
<i>Welcome to</i> TTP,
Titan Truth Podcast.

06:33.317 --> 06:35.608
<i>Episode number 245.</i>

06:35.692 --> 06:37.358
<i>Today is the day.</i>

06:37.442 --> 06:39.317
<i>Maybe the last podcast
I ever record.</i>

06:39.400 --> 06:41.067
<i>And look, I know
I said that last week</i>

06:41.150 --> 06:42.983
<i>and maybe the week before
and a few other times.</i>

06:43.067 --> 06:44.567
<i>But, look, this is the point.</i>

06:44.650 --> 06:47.400
After five years of deep cover
at Apex Cybernetics,

06:47.483 --> 06:49.233
I'm finally taking my shot.

06:49.317 --> 06:50.900
Something bad
is going on here.

06:50.983 --> 06:52.317
I don't know what it is,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.733
but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

06:54.817 --> 06:57.317
and expose
a vast corporate conspiracy.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.942
Yeah, you can call me
a whistleblower,

06:59.025 --> 07:00.400
but I ain't just whistling.

07:00.483 --> 07:03.983
I mean, this is more
than a leak. It's a flood.

07:04.067 --> 07:05.775
And believe me, this flood

07:05.858 --> 07:08.942
is gonna wash away
all of Apex's lies.

07:09.025 --> 07:10.733
You can believe that.

07:15.442 --> 07:17.983
<i>Welcome to Apex Cybernetics.</i>

07:18.067 --> 07:21.608
<i>No unauthorized persons
allowed beyond this point.</i>

07:21.692 --> 07:24.442
<i>When we started
Apex Cybernetics,</i>

07:24.525 --> 07:25.942
<i>we dreamt of new ways</i>

07:26.025 --> 07:29.358
<i>to push past the limits
of human potential.</i>

07:29.442 --> 07:33.483
<i>Robotics, the human mind,
artificial intelligence.</i>

07:33.567 --> 07:38.150
<i>Who knows what brave new
future we'll dream of next?</i>

07:39.275 --> 07:41.067
<i>I'm Walter Simmons,</i>

07:41.150 --> 07:43.525
<i>and it is my privilege
to lead Apex</i>

07:43.608 --> 07:46.150
<i>into humanity's bold new era.</i>

07:46.233 --> 07:48.150
<i>We're not going anywhere.</i>

07:48.983 --> 07:50.192
<i>And neither are you.</i>

07:52.900 --> 07:54.567
There you are, baby.

08:04.733 --> 08:06.150
No, don't eat that!

08:06.233 --> 08:07.983
It's incredibly unhealthy.

08:09.317 --> 08:10.983
It's just all the GMOs.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.567
Growing a second head
could be useful.

08:12.650 --> 08:13.650
You have to let me know.

08:13.733 --> 08:15.025
Because me, myself?

08:15.108 --> 08:16.650
I can barely handle
the one I got.

08:16.733 --> 08:19.692
Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

08:19.775 --> 08:22.483
You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

08:22.567 --> 08:24.067
I mean, really doing here.

08:24.150 --> 08:25.483
Why are you here?

08:25.567 --> 08:27.358
This isn't Engineering.

08:27.442 --> 08:28.817
Because, you know,
I had to wait

08:28.900 --> 08:30.192
because they're rendering
these new specs,

08:30.275 --> 08:31.983
which is gonna
take over, uh...

08:32.067 --> 08:33.400
That's calculator mode.

08:33.482 --> 08:35.107
...over one hour,
maybe even more.

08:35.192 --> 08:37.192
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

08:37.275 --> 08:39.732
- and make some new friends.
- Oh.

08:39.817 --> 08:41.067
Oh! Now that
we're new friends,

08:41.150 --> 08:42.900
I can share something
with you, right?

08:42.982 --> 08:44.525
I know it's in here somewhere.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.192
This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.525
It's really amazing.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.400
Don't know
if I used that or not.

08:51.358 --> 08:53.858
Yes. This. Check this out.

08:53.942 --> 08:56.608
That right there
is radio mesh networking

08:56.692 --> 08:58.358
with a voice-record
subprocessor.

08:58.442 --> 09:00.192
- Guess from where. Come on.
- I don't care.

09:00.275 --> 09:01.525
A toaster!

09:01.608 --> 09:03.275
It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

09:03.358 --> 09:04.900
I have to go to the bathroom.

09:04.983 --> 09:06.358
Is it one or two?

09:06.442 --> 09:08.025
'Cause if it's two, it's
probably from these apples.

09:08.108 --> 09:10.733
Hey, you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

09:10.817 --> 09:11.817
I'm good.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.483
Okay, I'll just stay here.

09:15.525 --> 09:17.775
Okay. Yeah.

09:19.150 --> 09:20.858
Ah, let's see.

09:20.942 --> 09:22.025
Whoo.

09:23.775 --> 09:25.025
Screen.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.900
What are they shipping
to Hong Kong?

09:31.983 --> 09:34.150
What's Sublevel 33?

09:36.608 --> 09:37.942
What the...?

09:41.317 --> 09:43.400
<i>Evacuation, Titan alert.</i>

09:43.483 --> 09:45.150
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

09:45.233 --> 09:47.108
<i>All Apex employees,
please proceed...</i>

09:47.192 --> 09:49.358
That is my cue. That's my cue.

09:49.442 --> 09:51.233
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

10:18.067 --> 10:21.233
Proceed to the fallout shelter
in a single-file line.

10:21.317 --> 10:22.317
Let's go!

10:22.400 --> 10:23.942
They used
cyanide capsules

10:24.025 --> 10:25.483
instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in,

10:25.567 --> 10:26.983
but, you know,
that's neither here nor there,

10:27.067 --> 10:28.650
so don't listen to me.

10:28.733 --> 10:32.525
Level two personnel,
this way! Let's go, let's go!

10:33.733 --> 10:35.150
Yeah, that way.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.275
It's time!

10:45.358 --> 10:47.733
We need to go now!

11:13.775 --> 11:15.733
<i>Evacuate.</i>

11:15.817 --> 11:18.317
One level at a time, okay.

11:19.483 --> 11:21.400
- No.
- Hey, you!

11:21.483 --> 11:23.400
- Where's your clearance tag?
- You know what?

11:23.483 --> 11:24.858
The fact that
you're talking about

11:24.942 --> 11:26.400
clearance tags right now
in a time of crisis

11:26.483 --> 11:28.025
is incredibly unprofessional.

11:28.108 --> 11:29.942
We should be talking
about evacuation.

11:30.025 --> 11:31.150
Yo! Okay!

11:46.942 --> 11:48.733
Oh, my God.

11:57.483 --> 12:01.275
Oh, no. What the hell is that?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.483
<i>This is CNN breaking news.</i>

<i>Welcome back, loyal listeners,</i>

13:11.692 --> 13:14.317
<i>to</i> Titan Truth Podcast,
<i>episode 246.</i>

13:14.400 --> 13:15.900
<i>Oh, my God. I was there.</i>

13:15.983 --> 13:18.692
<i>Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!</i>

13:18.775 --> 13:20.983
<i>You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears</i>

13:21.067 --> 13:23.692
<i>and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?</i>

13:23.775 --> 13:27.483
<i>Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.</i>

13:33.400 --> 13:35.067
Dad, I'm telling
you, there's something

13:35.150 --> 13:36.858
provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.317
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

13:39.400 --> 13:40.900
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

13:40.983 --> 13:42.983
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.817
- You should be in school.
- I am just trying to help.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.067
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

13:48.150 --> 13:50.067
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

13:50.150 --> 13:52.317
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.983
I don't have any more.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.983
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

13:56.067 --> 13:59.317
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.692
How could you doubt him?

14:00.775 --> 14:02.358
- There has to be a pattern.
- There doesn't.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.400
- A reason why he was provoked.
- There isn't.

14:04.483 --> 14:05.692
How do you know that?

14:05.775 --> 14:07.650
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

14:07.733 --> 14:09.150
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

14:09.233 --> 14:11.275
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

14:11.358 --> 14:13.983
So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

14:15.942 --> 14:17.525
See you at home, Dad.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.442
<i>You wanna know
my theory?</i>

14:23.525 --> 14:25.275
<i>I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.</i>

14:25.358 --> 14:27.775
<i>Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.</i>

14:27.858 --> 14:29.567
<i>Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back</i>

14:29.650 --> 14:31.358
<i>to sixth grade with this,
okay?</i>

14:31.442 --> 14:33.858
<i>Godzilla attacks when
provoked, that's the pattern.</i>

14:33.942 --> 14:36.567
<i>Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub</i>

14:36.650 --> 14:37.817
<i>with an advanced robotics lab.</i>

14:37.900 --> 14:39.150
<i>That's the variable.</i>

14:39.233 --> 14:40.983
<i>And add them up
and your answer is</i>

14:41.067 --> 14:43.692
<i>that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.</i>

15:00.983 --> 15:02.108
Can I help you?

15:03.983 --> 15:05.567
If you want an appointment,

15:05.650 --> 15:07.067
my office hours
are nine to five.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.900
- Please, Dr. Lind.
- What the f...

15:09.983 --> 15:12.233
Guys like you and me,

15:12.317 --> 15:14.317
we don't do normal hours,
do we?

15:17.108 --> 15:18.567
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

15:18.650 --> 15:20.067
for as long as you have.

15:20.150 --> 15:23.150
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

15:23.233 --> 15:24.442
is fascinating.

15:24.525 --> 15:26.483
Your book was very impressive.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.442
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

15:29.525 --> 15:31.108
in my apartment
if you want some.

15:32.358 --> 15:34.233
Walt Simmons.

15:34.317 --> 15:36.108
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

15:36.192 --> 15:39.775
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

15:39.858 --> 15:43.150
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.150
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

15:46.233 --> 15:47.608
Allow me to introduce

15:47.692 --> 15:51.400
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.900
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

15:59.025 --> 16:03.025
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

16:03.108 --> 16:05.650
You know what this is, right?

16:05.733 --> 16:07.067
Hollow Earth.

16:07.150 --> 16:10.442
An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

16:10.525 --> 16:12.025
right beneath our feet.

16:16.067 --> 16:18.400
This energy signal
is enormous.

16:18.483 --> 16:21.900
And almost identical
to readings from <i>Gojira.</i>

16:21.983 --> 16:24.233
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.608
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

16:26.692 --> 16:31.400
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

16:31.483 --> 16:34.442
If we can harness
this life force,

16:34.525 --> 16:38.108
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

16:38.192 --> 16:40.358
I need your help to find it.

16:42.817 --> 16:46.108
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

16:47.150 --> 16:48.483
Did you read the reviews?

16:48.567 --> 16:51.525
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

16:51.608 --> 16:53.150
Look where they put my office.

16:53.233 --> 16:56.567
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

16:56.650 --> 16:59.358
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

16:59.442 --> 17:01.775
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

17:02.567 --> 17:03.817
We tried.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.858
I'm sorry about your brother.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.858
He was a true pioneer.

17:11.942 --> 17:13.025
Thanks.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.900
See, all of our forward scans

17:19.983 --> 17:23.275
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

17:23.358 --> 17:29.025
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

17:31.733 --> 17:34.525
When they tried to enter,

17:34.608 --> 17:37.233
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.608
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

17:39.692 --> 17:41.817
reversed in a split second.

17:43.650 --> 17:46.567
They were crushed
in an instant.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.900
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

17:51.983 --> 17:54.067
have created
a phenomenal craft

17:54.150 --> 17:56.775
which could sustain
such an inversion?

17:59.483 --> 18:02.025
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

18:02.608 --> 18:03.817
HEAV.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.942
We can make the journey

18:08.025 --> 18:10.317
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.942
But we need you
to lead the mission.

18:19.608 --> 18:20.817
Help me.

18:22.483 --> 18:24.775
Help everyone.

18:24.858 --> 18:27.275
Finding this needle
in a haystack

18:27.358 --> 18:29.608
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

18:29.692 --> 18:33.483
Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

18:34.192 --> 18:35.442
But it's crazy.

18:35.525 --> 18:39.150
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.150
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

18:43.233 --> 18:46.025
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

18:46.108 --> 18:48.150
to return
to their evolutionary source.

18:48.233 --> 18:49.567
Like spawning salmon.

18:49.650 --> 18:53.858
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

18:53.942 --> 18:56.150
So if this is the Titans' home

18:56.233 --> 18:58.358
and this life force
sustains them...

18:58.442 --> 19:00.275
A Titan
could show you the way.

19:01.942 --> 19:03.942
Yeah.

19:04.025 --> 19:06.067
With a little help
of an old colleague.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.858
Ugh, where is it?

19:41.942 --> 19:44.942
<i>Dr. Andrews, you have
a visitor waiting for you at security.</i>

19:51.692 --> 19:52.858
Okay.

20:07.608 --> 20:09.692
A power source
in Hollow Earth?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.983
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

20:12.067 --> 20:14.983
It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

20:15.067 --> 20:17.567
The second you take
Kong out of containment,

20:17.650 --> 20:19.108
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

20:19.192 --> 20:20.650
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

20:20.733 --> 20:22.692
No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

20:22.775 --> 20:23.900
on Kong's habitat.

20:23.983 --> 20:25.400
No way am I
letting you drag him

20:25.483 --> 20:27.108
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.567
No, not as a weapon.
As an ally.

20:29.650 --> 20:31.733
To protect us,
lead the way down there.

20:31.817 --> 20:33.983
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.775
You always believed
that Skull Island

20:35.858 --> 20:38.275
was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface, right?

20:38.358 --> 20:40.108
And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

20:40.192 --> 20:41.317
Mm-hmm.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.525
Through the entrance
in Antarctica,

20:42.608 --> 20:44.650
we could help him
find a new home.

20:44.733 --> 20:46.650
And he could save ours.

20:47.483 --> 20:48.858
Hers.

20:48.942 --> 20:51.400
That power source
may be our only hope.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.483
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

20:55.275 --> 20:56.900
We have to take it.

21:14.317 --> 21:15.567
- Okay.
- Yes!

21:15.650 --> 21:18.775
But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

21:18.858 --> 21:21.025
You name the terms. Thank you.

21:22.650 --> 21:24.983
Sorry. Thank you.

21:26.192 --> 21:27.608
You won't regret this.

21:27.692 --> 21:29.900
Mm, I already regret this.

21:49.692 --> 21:51.567
Come on.

22:49.233 --> 22:52.650
Whoo! Jeez,
I can smell him from up here.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.692
Well, he can smell you, too.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.650
Still not a fan, huh?

23:10.483 --> 23:11.650
What's she saying?

23:12.692 --> 23:14.233
Just an Iwi expression.

23:14.317 --> 23:15.900
It means
that you're very brave.

23:15.983 --> 23:17.150
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.650
Hey, use a light touch
on the sedatives.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.192
He's our escort.

23:23.275 --> 23:25.483
We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

23:25.567 --> 23:27.567
What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

23:27.650 --> 23:29.400
What do you do then?

23:29.483 --> 23:30.900
<i>Dr. Lind, please report</i>

23:30.983 --> 23:32.983
<i>to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.</i>

23:33.067 --> 23:34.192
Excuse me.

23:35.775 --> 23:37.067
New arrivals.

24:00.317 --> 24:01.400
Welcome.

24:03.983 --> 24:08.942
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

24:09.025 --> 24:10.775
- Ha-ha.
- I'm Maia Simmons.

24:10.858 --> 24:11.900
My father sent me.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.442
I run point for Apex.

24:13.525 --> 24:15.233
Nathan Lind, mission chief.

24:17.692 --> 24:20.775
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

24:22.275 --> 24:23.817
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles

24:23.900 --> 24:26.150
are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

24:26.233 --> 24:28.608
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

24:28.692 --> 24:30.317
but these prototypes
we're loaning you

24:30.400 --> 24:33.858
will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

24:33.942 --> 24:35.442
I love Miatas.

24:35.525 --> 24:37.650
Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

24:37.733 --> 24:39.442
The antigravity engines
alone produce

24:39.525 --> 24:41.942
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.150
Feel free to be impressed.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.233
Wow.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.317
All right, we'll be

25:01.400 --> 25:03.358
at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

25:03.442 --> 25:06.525
This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

25:06.608 --> 25:10.317
Once we're inside, Kong should
lead us to the power source.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.858
Now, the gravitational
inversion

25:11.942 --> 25:13.358
will be quite intense.

25:13.442 --> 25:14.817
Our best guess
is that on entry,

25:14.900 --> 25:16.900
it'll feel like
bungee jumping...

25:16.983 --> 25:19.150
with the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

25:19.233 --> 25:21.567
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

25:21.650 --> 25:22.858
HEAVs.

25:22.942 --> 25:25.483
If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are,

25:25.567 --> 25:27.192
I believe we can do this.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.775
They'll do the job.

25:29.483 --> 25:31.525
You just gotta do yours.

25:31.608 --> 25:32.983
Excellent.

25:35.275 --> 25:37.025
Dr. Andrews.

25:37.108 --> 25:39.900
We've avoided all of Godzilla's
known territorial waters

25:39.983 --> 25:41.692
according to your guidelines.

25:41.775 --> 25:42.692
Good.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.108
Do I need to be concerned?

25:44.192 --> 25:46.025
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

25:46.108 --> 25:48.567
And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

25:48.650 --> 25:50.192
The myths say
that their ancestors

25:50.275 --> 25:51.733
fought each other
in a great war.

25:51.817 --> 25:54.900
So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?

25:56.400 --> 25:59.025
No, I spent 10 years
on that island studying him.

25:59.108 --> 26:01.233
I know this for sure.

26:01.317 --> 26:03.608
Kong bows to no one.

26:51.275 --> 26:53.442
Is she supposed
to be out there?

27:58.858 --> 28:00.525
Jia, come on. Come on.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.108
Did the monkey just talk?

29:03.025 --> 29:05.233
<i>Okay, class, listen up.</i>

29:05.317 --> 29:08.900
<i>In the midst of Godzilla's
attack on Apex Pensacola,</i>

29:08.983 --> 29:12.775
<i>I found some crazy tech with
no official classification.</i>

29:13.650 --> 29:15.067
<i>What I saw doesn't match</i>

29:15.150 --> 29:16.858
<i>any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.</i>

29:16.942 --> 29:20.317
<i>So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy, hmm?</i>

29:20.400 --> 29:22.025
<i>This could be the thread
that finally unravels</i>

29:22.108 --> 29:23.733
<i>the Apex sweater
of conspiracy.</i>

29:23.817 --> 29:26.525
<i>You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.</i>

29:26.608 --> 29:27.942
<i>For now, I'm secure.</i>

29:28.025 --> 29:29.442
<i>Anonymous
and hiding in plain sight</i>

29:29.525 --> 29:31.108
<i>as I continue my mission.</i>

29:46.317 --> 29:48.650
To be clear, my brother can
never know we took his van.

29:48.733 --> 29:51.108
Josh, to be clear, even if
we got into an accident,

29:51.192 --> 29:52.650
I don't think he could tell.

29:52.733 --> 29:54.525
No, no, my brother would never
let you drive either.

29:54.608 --> 29:55.733
My mission, my wheel.

29:55.817 --> 29:57.233
I just don't think
it's a good idea,

29:57.317 --> 29:59.108
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

29:59.192 --> 30:01.483
I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.900
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

30:03.983 --> 30:05.900
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

30:05.983 --> 30:07.442
about Godzilla and Apex.

30:07.525 --> 30:10.150
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

30:10.233 --> 30:11.483
Because...

30:11.567 --> 30:13.733
If we don't, nobody else will.

30:15.275 --> 30:17.358
Are you coming or not?

30:17.442 --> 30:18.858
Obviously I'm coming.

30:20.483 --> 30:21.733
It's stuck.

30:21.817 --> 30:24.233
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

30:34.400 --> 30:36.442
<i>Mind control.
Read up on it, sheep.</i>

30:36.525 --> 30:38.150
<i>Psionic link technology
is a reality.</i>

30:38.233 --> 30:40.400
<i>That's right.
One brain controlling another.</i>

30:40.483 --> 30:41.775
Oh, man.

30:41.858 --> 30:42.858
<i>Imagine that
on a global scale</i>

30:42.942 --> 30:44.233
<i>and Apex is invincible.</i>

30:44.317 --> 30:46.025
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

30:46.108 --> 30:47.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:48.025 --> 30:50.108
Whoa! Knock it off!

30:50.192 --> 30:52.025
Wait, this is the part
I was telling you about.

30:52.108 --> 30:54.067
<i>...need special UV to
even know you've been marked!</i>

30:54.150 --> 30:55.733
<i>One or two gallons
won't cut it.</i>

30:55.817 --> 30:58.525
<i>I need my bleach in bulk!</i>

30:58.608 --> 31:00.650
<i>Because spy dust
is real, people!</i>

31:00.733 --> 31:02.358
<i>I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...</i>

31:02.442 --> 31:04.067
That's how we find him.

31:04.150 --> 31:06.067
- The bleach.
- Bleach?

31:06.150 --> 31:08.067
He consumes a ton of bleach.

31:08.150 --> 31:09.608
He drinks bleach?

31:10.650 --> 31:12.025
Showers with it.

31:12.108 --> 31:14.900
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

31:14.983 --> 31:17.858
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

31:17.942 --> 31:20.358
See? Tradecraft.

31:20.442 --> 31:23.025
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

31:28.692 --> 31:30.567
Come on,
just one more place.

31:30.650 --> 31:33.150
Madison, this is getting old.

31:33.233 --> 31:35.525
Hey, you sell bleach?

31:35.608 --> 31:37.733
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

31:37.817 --> 31:39.525
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

31:39.608 --> 31:41.233
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.567
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

31:43.650 --> 31:44.983
Look, we're looking for a guy

31:45.067 --> 31:46.567
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

31:46.650 --> 31:49.483
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

31:49.567 --> 31:50.942
He's probably paranoid,

31:51.025 --> 31:53.233
high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

31:53.317 --> 31:55.358
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

31:55.442 --> 31:56.567
if he has a beard.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.192
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

31:58.275 --> 31:59.942
Because I can help you
with candy.

32:00.025 --> 32:03.275
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

32:03.358 --> 32:04.775
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

32:06.608 --> 32:08.150
What are you doing?
You think...?

32:08.233 --> 32:11.525
Oh, you mean Bernie.

32:12.275 --> 32:13.525
Yeah, I know that guy.

32:13.608 --> 32:15.150
He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

32:15.233 --> 32:16.650
I know where he is, too.

32:16.733 --> 32:18.942
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.650
Bernie?

32:23.733 --> 32:25.275
Mister...
Mis...

32:26.692 --> 32:28.025
Mister Bernie not home.

32:28.108 --> 32:29.400
Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

32:29.483 --> 32:30.900
Yeah. Um...

32:30.983 --> 32:35.275
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

32:35.358 --> 32:37.400
No. No. No.

32:37.483 --> 32:41.275
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

32:41.358 --> 32:42.483
For knocking on a door?

32:42.567 --> 32:43.775
No. No.

32:43.858 --> 32:45.942
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

32:46.025 --> 32:47.942
My name is Madison Russell.

32:48.025 --> 32:50.983
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

32:51.067 --> 32:53.192
Emma Russell, right?

32:54.817 --> 32:57.900
<i>Before we go any farther,
I got one question.</i>

32:58.733 --> 33:00.192
Tap or no tap?

33:00.275 --> 33:01.817
No tap.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.233
- Excuse me, what is "tap"?
- Water.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.525
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

33:06.608 --> 33:09.358
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

33:09.442 --> 33:11.067
Oh, I drink tap water.

33:11.983 --> 33:13.442
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.025
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

33:15.108 --> 33:16.983
so it should be all right.

33:17.067 --> 33:18.900
- Thanks.
- Okay.

33:18.983 --> 33:20.108
What you got?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.442
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

33:23.525 --> 33:24.775
haven't just been random.

33:24.858 --> 33:26.775
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

33:26.858 --> 33:28.317
I'm of the same opinion.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.733
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

33:30.817 --> 33:33.358
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

33:33.442 --> 33:35.525
trying to figure out
what their game was.

33:35.608 --> 33:38.108
Then, last week...

33:38.192 --> 33:39.317
I saw this.

33:40.608 --> 33:43.692
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

33:43.775 --> 33:45.192
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

33:45.275 --> 33:46.650
which makes no sense

33:46.733 --> 33:48.567
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

33:48.650 --> 33:49.900
- Then what?
- And then boom!

33:49.983 --> 33:51.692
Godzilla shows up.

33:51.775 --> 33:53.192
Caved in half the facility,

33:53.275 --> 33:55.025
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

33:55.108 --> 33:56.692
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

33:56.775 --> 33:58.733
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

33:58.817 --> 34:01.025
Yeah, but what is that?

34:04.983 --> 34:06.358
That's, um...

34:07.817 --> 34:10.150
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

34:10.233 --> 34:12.525
Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

34:12.608 --> 34:14.608
It was a gift from my Sara.

34:14.692 --> 34:15.775
You have a Sara?

34:15.858 --> 34:17.400
She was my wife.

34:17.483 --> 34:19.567
Um, she passed on.

34:23.150 --> 34:24.775
She was my rock.

34:25.233 --> 34:27.192
My truth.

34:27.275 --> 34:30.317
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

34:30.400 --> 34:32.358
that's the day
you know I've given up.

34:37.567 --> 34:39.192
Bernie.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.067
I think we can
help each other.

34:44.942 --> 34:47.442
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

34:47.525 --> 34:49.900
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

34:49.983 --> 34:51.275
We're breaking into Apex.

34:51.358 --> 34:53.483
- Wait, what?
- You heard her.

34:53.567 --> 34:55.275
Tap water.

34:55.358 --> 34:56.817
Shit.

35:26.608 --> 35:27.983
Hey.

36:08.817 --> 36:10.317
Thank you.

36:11.817 --> 36:13.275
How is she?

36:13.358 --> 36:16.358
Calm. So calm, it's scary.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.525
That was extraordinary.

36:18.608 --> 36:22.358
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

36:22.442 --> 36:24.983
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

36:25.067 --> 36:27.983
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

36:28.067 --> 36:29.358
No.

36:29.442 --> 36:31.567
I knew that they had a bond.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.108
He trusts her.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.400
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

36:36.942 --> 36:40.192
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

36:40.275 --> 36:42.400
When the storm
took over the island,

36:42.483 --> 36:44.233
it wiped out
the native people.

36:44.317 --> 36:45.692
But Kong saved her.

36:45.775 --> 36:47.858
She had nowhere to go.

36:47.942 --> 36:49.358
So I made a promise,

36:49.442 --> 36:51.942
then and there,
to protect her.

36:52.025 --> 36:56.192
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

36:58.900 --> 37:01.400
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

37:03.650 --> 37:04.983
No.

37:05.067 --> 37:06.733
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

37:06.817 --> 37:09.025
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

37:10.442 --> 37:12.108
And she's a child.

37:40.108 --> 37:43.442
I know
Jia is only a child.

37:43.525 --> 37:47.442
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

37:47.525 --> 37:50.567
<i>And we need Kong
to find that power source.</i>

37:52.192 --> 37:54.275
The world needs him.

38:07.317 --> 38:08.983
What's she saying?

38:09.067 --> 38:10.192
Godzilla.

38:19.817 --> 38:21.150
Did we change course?

38:21.233 --> 38:23.025
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

38:23.108 --> 38:25.025
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

38:25.108 --> 38:26.317
He's not coming for us.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.692
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

38:28.775 --> 38:30.983
How about we throw you off
instead, huh?

38:32.983 --> 38:34.150
We have to release him.

38:34.233 --> 38:35.733
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

38:35.817 --> 38:37.108
He's a sitting duck out there.

38:37.192 --> 38:39.150
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

40:33.275 --> 40:35.067
Oh, my God, Jia!

40:35.150 --> 40:36.275
Nathan?

44:28.400 --> 44:29.692
He needs our help.

44:29.775 --> 44:31.817
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

44:31.900 --> 44:33.525
Depth charges.

45:44.483 --> 45:45.942
He's circling back.

45:46.025 --> 45:49.108
This won't end
until one of them submits.

45:51.650 --> 45:53.650
- Shut it down.
- What?

45:54.192 --> 45:55.483
All of it.

45:55.567 --> 45:57.275
Guns, engines.

45:57.358 --> 46:00.317
- Shut it down. Right now.
- If we do that, we're dead.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.108
No, we're playing dead.

46:02.192 --> 46:04.067
And we're making him think
that he's won.

46:07.983 --> 46:10.442
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

46:10.525 --> 46:11.858
<i>Kill anything
that makes a noise.</i>

46:25.150 --> 46:26.608
This better work.

47:18.317 --> 47:21.150
As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

47:21.233 --> 47:23.900
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

47:30.525 --> 47:32.692
How's Kong with heights?

47:43.025 --> 47:44.358
So, what's the plan?

47:44.442 --> 47:47.067
We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

47:47.150 --> 47:48.317
Ow.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.233
Keep it moving, tap water.

47:53.400 --> 47:54.650
Go ahead.

48:02.983 --> 48:06.275
All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

48:07.608 --> 48:09.483
Okay. We got this.

48:10.150 --> 48:11.400
Oh, my God!

48:11.483 --> 48:12.567
Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

48:12.650 --> 48:14.067
Yeah, why?

48:14.150 --> 48:15.733
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

48:15.817 --> 48:17.108
and carries
a bottle of whiskey

48:17.192 --> 48:19.192
from his dead wife like a gun.

48:19.275 --> 48:20.942
I think it's romantic.

48:21.025 --> 48:22.108
Whoo-hoo!

48:23.150 --> 48:25.275
I really don't
understand women.

48:42.567 --> 48:44.150
Okay, come on.

48:50.192 --> 48:53.150
This whole thing came
down, and there was this...

48:54.025 --> 48:55.858
eye.

48:55.942 --> 48:57.900
Uh, what are
we looking at?

48:57.983 --> 49:00.400
No, no, no, no.
No, it was here.

49:00.483 --> 49:03.275
I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

49:03.358 --> 49:04.942
Hey, guys.

49:07.692 --> 49:09.900
Anyone know
where this leads to?

49:11.233 --> 49:12.483
You believe me, right?

49:12.567 --> 49:14.025
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

49:14.108 --> 49:16.942
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

49:17.025 --> 49:20.442
"Sublevel." How deep
does this thing go, Bernie?

49:20.525 --> 49:23.733
Hell. Goes to hell.

49:23.817 --> 49:25.692
<i>Sublevel 33.</i>

49:27.567 --> 49:29.150
<i>Maglev shuttle departure</i>

49:29.233 --> 49:32.483

49:36.317 --> 49:38.275
Whoa.

49:41.608 --> 49:43.192
What is all this?

49:43.275 --> 49:45.483
It's breakaway civilization.

49:45.567 --> 49:46.983
I mean, come on.
This is page one

49:47.067 --> 49:49.817
in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

49:49.900 --> 49:53.025
I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

49:53.108 --> 49:55.358
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

49:55.442 --> 49:57.317
in case any
of these governments

49:57.400 --> 49:58.483
and megacorporations

49:58.567 --> 50:00.733
accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

50:01.942 --> 50:03.108
It makes sense

50:03.192 --> 50:04.150
- if you think about it.
- Yeah, sure.

50:06.733 --> 50:07.900
- Someone's coming.
- What?

50:07.983 --> 50:09.275
- Someone's coming.
- What?

50:09.358 --> 50:10.942
- Someone's coming?
- Yes!

50:15.150 --> 50:16.900
Oh, my God.

50:21.108 --> 50:24.358
- They look like eggs.
- Skull-crawlers.

50:24.442 --> 50:26.858
What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

50:26.942 --> 50:28.233
All right,
let's load it up!

50:29.692 --> 50:31.108
What was that?
What was that?

50:31.192 --> 50:33.150
No way. No, no, no. Come on.

50:33.233 --> 50:35.275
Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

50:52.483 --> 50:53.650
It says we're headed

50:53.733 --> 50:55.192
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

50:55.275 --> 50:56.733
- What?
- Hong Kong.

50:56.817 --> 50:59.025
That means that we're gonna
get some answers.

50:59.108 --> 51:01.317
<i>G10, clear for launch.</i>

51:12.067 --> 51:13.192
Here we go.

51:43.525 --> 51:44.983
We're getting close!

53:57.067 --> 53:58.900
It's not working.

53:58.983 --> 54:00.733
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

54:00.817 --> 54:01.942
What if she tells him

54:02.025 --> 54:03.900
there are others
down there like him?

54:04.817 --> 54:06.067
But you don't know that.

54:06.150 --> 54:08.733
We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

54:09.650 --> 54:11.733
There's no way back for him.

54:11.817 --> 54:13.900
And he can't survive here.

54:27.067 --> 54:29.233
All right. All right.

54:36.025 --> 54:37.233
Hey.

55:20.817 --> 55:24.108
He's going. Prepare to launch!
Everybody to their station.

55:24.192 --> 55:25.317
We gotta go.

56:15.442 --> 56:17.025
There.

56:17.108 --> 56:18.275
There he is.

56:32.317 --> 56:34.150
Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

56:34.233 --> 56:36.567
Oh, he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

56:36.650 --> 56:39.775
We're about to be launched
1,000 miles in two seconds

56:39.858 --> 56:44.900
until gravity inverts itself
and spits us into free fall.

56:46.608 --> 56:49.108
It'll be the most amazing
thing you've ever seen.

56:51.317 --> 56:53.233
Here. For the vomit.

56:53.317 --> 56:54.442

<i>Engine failure, gravity low.</i>

propulsion!

01:01:54.608 --> 01:01:56.942
Oh, he certainly can move.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.233
Okay, okay.

01:03:26.317 --> 01:03:28.733

<i>Attention: Shipping pod arriving.</i>

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.567
Okay. Keep quiet.
Follow me.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:50.733
We're going in?

01:03:50.817 --> 01:03:52.067
Yeah.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:57.650
Oh, no!

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.608
Every time, I swear.
Doors hate us.

01:04:02.358 --> 01:04:04.858
Oh, yeah.

01:04:09.775 --> 01:04:11.983
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

01:04:12.067 --> 01:04:16.483
It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

01:04:16.567 --> 01:04:18.192
So, what is this place?

01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:21.442
Well, if there's a corporate-friendly
term for "sacrifice pit,"

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:24.025
I'd say we are in it.

01:04:24.942 --> 01:04:27.233
Oh, God, that stinks.

01:04:32.817 --> 01:04:34.400
That's not good. Bernie!

01:04:34.483 --> 01:04:35.900
I really hate this place.

01:04:38.858 --> 01:04:41.067
<i>Attention: Demonstration</i>

01:04:57.775 --> 01:05:01.275
Mr. Simmons,

Commence uplink.

01:05:30.483 --> 01:05:32.233

<i>Pilot engaged.</i>

01:06:05.567 --> 01:06:07.608
That's robot Godzilla.

01:06:07.692 --> 01:06:09.358
Oh, no. That's...

01:06:09.442 --> 01:06:11.317
That's Mechagodzilla.

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:32.358
Release number 10.

01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:42.108
Go, go!
Go through there!

01:06:48.942 --> 01:06:51.192
Madison! Run, girl!

01:07:18.983 --> 01:07:20.108
Yes!

01:07:30.358 --> 01:07:32.400
Damn it.

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:35.067
<i>System only reached 40% power.</i>

01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:36.233
Oh, I know.

01:07:36.317 --> 01:07:37.567
As expected.

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:39.150
<i>Don't worry.
Once the Hollow Earth</i>

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.025
our power troubles
will be over.

01:07:43.108 --> 01:07:44.942
If they can find
the source.

01:07:45.025 --> 01:07:49.067
<i>Oh, they'll find it.
I have faith in my daughter.</i>

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.400
I have faith in our creation.

01:07:51.483 --> 01:07:54.442
And humanity
will once again...

01:07:54.525 --> 01:07:57.858
be the apex species.

01:07:57.942 --> 01:08:01.900
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

01:08:01.983 --> 01:08:04.983
They're trying
to replace him.

01:08:30.317 --> 01:08:32.442
Come on, Maddie.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:36.317
<i>Sir,
Godzilla just made an abrupt change</i>

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:38.024
<i>in direction.
He's moving very fast.</i>

01:08:38.108 --> 01:08:40.442
<i>Projections show he's likely
headed to Hong Kong.</i>

01:08:40.524 --> 01:08:43.483
<i>Transport is ready and waiting
to take you there, sir.</i>

01:09:04.692 --> 01:09:05.942
That has to be it.

01:11:06.192 --> 01:11:07.983
We were right.

01:11:09.025 --> 01:11:10.442
He's home.

01:12:34.108 --> 01:12:35.858
<i>All personnel must display</i>

01:12:35.942 --> 01:12:38.817

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.983
Follow me.

01:12:41.067 --> 01:12:42.775
Lizard people
build all their facilities

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.858
the same way.
I can find the exit.

01:12:46.983 --> 01:12:49.025
The exit's this way.

01:12:49.108 --> 01:12:51.233
Guys. Madison!

01:13:01.025 --> 01:13:02.858
Oh, my God.

01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:07.567
Bitch, what?

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.108
It's a Titan skull.

01:13:09.192 --> 01:13:12.400
No, no, no.
That's not just any Titan.

01:13:12.483 --> 01:13:13.983
That's Monster Zero.

01:13:14.067 --> 01:13:16.442
Ghidorah.

01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:22.733
They hardwired its DNA.

01:13:22.817 --> 01:13:24.817
Self-generating
neural pathways

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.025
capable of intuitive learning.

01:13:27.108 --> 01:13:29.192
Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

01:13:29.275 --> 01:13:31.567
- It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:36.942
It had three heads.

01:13:37.025 --> 01:13:38.233
Its necks were so long,

01:13:38.317 --> 01:13:40.567
they communicated
telepathically.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.025
And there's one here

01:13:42.108 --> 01:13:43.983
and another one
inside of that thing.

01:13:44.067 --> 01:13:46.483
Yeah, it could be
a psionic interface.

01:13:47.192 --> 01:13:48.942
Oh, my God.

01:13:50.525 --> 01:13:51.733
Careful.

01:13:51.817 --> 01:13:52.900
It's a pilot.

01:13:52.983 --> 01:13:56.233
Yeah.
He's in a trance.

01:13:56.317 --> 01:13:58.192
That's a psionic uplink.

01:13:59.358 --> 01:14:01.775
It follows his will.

01:14:01.858 --> 01:14:04.233
Oh, Apex, what have you done?

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.025
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order, Doctor.

01:14:50.108 --> 01:14:51.858
<i>The city is being evacuated.</i>

01:15:00.025 --> 01:15:03.483
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

01:15:23.442 --> 01:15:24.775
What is he doing?

01:15:54.442 --> 01:15:55.858
It's the axe.

01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:57.858
It's drawing radiation
from the core

01:15:57.942 --> 01:15:59.442
like it's charging.

01:16:41.317 --> 01:16:45.025
Whoa! Godzilla's
responding! They found it!

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:50.525
What in the hell?

01:17:04.192 --> 01:17:05.817
What are you doing?

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.650
Extracting a sample.

01:17:07.733 --> 01:17:09.942
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.608
You can't just drill into it.

01:17:11.692 --> 01:17:13.608
Actually, we can.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.442
My father gets what he wants.

01:17:18.525 --> 01:17:20.192
That's Apex property now.

01:17:20.275 --> 01:17:21.483
What?

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:29.650
Energy signature incoming.

01:17:29.733 --> 01:17:32.775
We should be able
to recreate it soon.

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.942
That is the discovery
of the millennium.

01:17:38.025 --> 01:17:40.650
- You can't strip it for parts.
- Hold it.

01:18:06.442 --> 01:18:08.525
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

01:18:08.608 --> 01:18:10.192
Let's go!

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.108
Yes.

01:18:13.192 --> 01:18:16.692
Mr. Serizawa,
start your engines!

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.025
The upgrade is untested.

01:18:18.108 --> 01:18:19.567
Once we get online,

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.317
<i>Gojira</i> will come
straight for us.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.983
He's been coming for us

01:18:23.067 --> 01:18:25.025
since our creation
first awoke.

01:18:25.108 --> 01:18:27.442
- We must embrace it.
- We shouldn't rush this.

01:18:27.525 --> 01:18:29.650
We have no idea
how this energy source

01:18:29.733 --> 01:18:30.775
will affect the Mecha.

01:18:30.858 --> 01:18:32.692
Get in the goddamn chair.

01:18:47.817 --> 01:18:50.525
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

01:18:50.608 --> 01:18:53.150
Move! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

01:18:59.483 --> 01:19:02.317
This way, sir! Hurry!
We gotta get back...

01:19:28.983 --> 01:19:30.733
Okay.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:09.025
Get him out of the way!
Shoot him!

01:20:11.275 --> 01:20:12.858
Go, go, go!

01:20:21.858 --> 01:20:23.025
Oh, no.

01:20:23.692 --> 01:20:24.983
No, no, no...

01:20:27.733 --> 01:20:30.358
Oh, Jesus!
Come on, let's go!

01:20:58.942 --> 01:21:00.317
- Hold on, ladies.
- Yeah.

01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:02.275
Whoa.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.817
Stay low.

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:36.900
Yeah. Going viral.

01:21:37.608 --> 01:21:38.692
What?

01:21:38.775 --> 01:21:41.400
We've gotta try and stop this.

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.608
Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:47.650
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction,

01:21:47.733 --> 01:21:49.317
this would be
a great DJ booth.

01:21:53.483 --> 01:21:54.817
I know what it... Maintenance.

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.483
Madison, we should go.

01:21:56.567 --> 01:21:58.192
I'm Maintenance.
You don't have to alert the...

01:21:58.275 --> 01:21:59.900
She doesn't buy that.
Uh, Madison, we need to go.

01:21:59.983 --> 01:22:01.900
The woman
with the villain hairdo...

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.442
Madison, they have guns.

01:22:03.525 --> 01:22:06.233
Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof
so I can't really...

01:22:06.317 --> 01:22:08.317
- I wanna communicate...
- Open the door!

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.483
Say again?

01:22:09.567 --> 01:22:11.275
Oh, God!
Get down! Get down!

01:22:11.358 --> 01:22:13.442
Oh, shit!

01:24:48.275 --> 01:24:50.733
We're about to breach
the veil! Hold on!

01:26:01.692 --> 01:26:04.192
Looks like round two
goes to Kong.

01:26:16.775 --> 01:26:17.858
Hey!

01:26:22.942 --> 01:26:26.567
Oh, come on, guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:28.608
Greenpea...

01:26:28.692 --> 01:26:30.900
Actually, sir, not like
you would know this,

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:32.817
but I'm Level Two
Assistant Engineering...

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.358
Well, Provisional Level Two
Assistant Engineering,

01:26:35.442 --> 01:26:36.733
not like you would know that.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:38.775
My evaluations
were incredibly encourag...

01:26:38.858 --> 01:26:43.150
I'm just saying Greenpeace
wishes, is all I'm saying.

01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:46.900
Where do I know you from?

01:26:49.483 --> 01:26:51.692
Oh, my goodness.

01:26:51.775 --> 01:26:54.942
Director Russell's daughter,
yes?

01:26:55.025 --> 01:26:56.608
You caused all of this.

01:26:56.692 --> 01:27:00.900
If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

01:27:00.983 --> 01:27:03.567
have given humanity a chance
against the Titans,

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:06.567
then, yes,
I will own that title.

01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:09.067
Godzilla had left us in peace.

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:10.900
You provoked him into war.

01:27:10.983 --> 01:27:13.733
There can only be one alpha,
Miss Russell.

01:27:13.817 --> 01:27:16.692
It seems to have been
providence.

01:30:06.358 --> 01:30:08.067
<i>It's time to launch.</i>

01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:10.317
<i>Begin pilot integration.</i>

01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:19.483
And now...

01:30:20.567 --> 01:30:21.900
my Mecha.

01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:25.650
<i>It's not only
Godzilla's equal...</i>

01:30:27.567 --> 01:30:29.317
<i>but his superior.</i>

01:30:31.358 --> 01:30:34.983
The Apex Titan of my own hand.

01:30:36.733 --> 01:30:39.733
<i>It's time to show
the world what you can do.</i>

01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:44.025
<i>Pilot engaged.</i>

01:30:47.858 --> 01:30:51.025
<i>Alert: Failure.
System unstable.</i>

01:30:51.108 --> 01:30:55.233
<i>Alert: Failure.
System unstable.</i>

01:30:57.358 --> 01:31:00.817
This is how we,
as a species, win.

01:31:02.108 --> 01:31:03.900
You see, 10 years ago,

01:31:03.983 --> 01:31:07.608
when <i>Gojira</i> was first revealed
to the world,

01:31:07.692 --> 01:31:09.817
I had a dream.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.983
And in that dream,
I saw one thing.

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:18.817
And that beautiful,
amazing thing was...

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.067
Oh, shit.

01:31:23.150 --> 01:31:24.233
No!

01:31:37.317 --> 01:31:39.108
It's unfair.

01:31:39.192 --> 01:31:41.483
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

01:32:17.775 --> 01:32:19.400
What in God's name is that?

01:33:04.358 --> 01:33:06.733
It's thinking for itself now.

01:33:06.817 --> 01:33:08.900
We have to warn Monarch.

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:11.483
Or try to stop it ourselves.

01:33:11.567 --> 01:33:13.275
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

01:33:13.358 --> 01:33:15.358
Wait, Josh.

01:33:15.442 --> 01:33:17.442
If I can figure out
the password,

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.275
maybe we can shut it down.

01:33:19.358 --> 01:33:20.442
All right.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.775
What the hell is that?

01:34:27.567 --> 01:34:28.817
What?

01:34:34.650 --> 01:34:36.567
What's happening?

01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:38.483
She can feel his heartbeat.

01:34:39.108 --> 01:34:40.150
He's dying.

01:34:42.608 --> 01:34:44.692
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

01:34:44.775 --> 01:34:46.192
We'd need a charge
big enough to...

01:34:46.275 --> 01:34:48.108
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

01:35:11.275 --> 01:35:12.775
Is that a password?

01:35:14.233 --> 01:35:15.483
Is that a password?

01:35:15.567 --> 01:35:16.817
I don't know!
I'm not used to this.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.483
I'm used to pirating
movies online.

01:35:18.567 --> 01:35:20.067
Okay, then go to Settings.

01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:21.650
- <i>This is Mark.</i>
- Dad?

01:35:21.733 --> 01:35:23.692
Madison, where are you?

01:35:23.775 --> 01:35:25.942
<i>Dad, can you hear...</i>

01:35:26.025 --> 01:35:27.817
Can you hear me?
I'm in Hong Kong.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.400
- <i>Mad?</i>
- Dad!

01:35:29.483 --> 01:35:31.317
Mad? Madison!

01:35:35.983 --> 01:35:37.233
A-ha!

01:35:40.567 --> 01:35:42.733
Okay, you two better
get some distance.

01:35:49.275 --> 01:35:50.567
Hey.

01:35:52.317 --> 01:35:55.400
You are
a very brave little girl.

01:36:02.942 --> 01:36:04.317
I don't know.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.025
Maybe we both are.

01:36:44.692 --> 01:36:45.942
Okay.

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.567
Good luck, big fella.

01:38:26.692 --> 01:38:28.108
I thought you said
you were a hacker!

01:38:28.192 --> 01:38:30.067
I said I took an HTML course
at summer camp.

01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:31.733
- HTML?
- Yes, at summer camp.

01:38:31.817 --> 01:38:34.192
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use QWERTY.

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:36.567
<i>Error. Security lock.</i>

01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:39.067
No. Shit!

01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:40.567
Shit.

01:40:18.192 --> 01:40:19.942
Josh!
You have to do something.

01:40:20.025 --> 01:40:22.025
We tried to take down
those Apex bastards,

01:40:22.108 --> 01:40:23.525
but I think this is
as far as we go,

01:40:23.608 --> 01:40:24.858
so bottom's up.

01:40:24.942 --> 01:40:27.150
I was hoping to die
with adults, but okay.

01:40:32.150 --> 01:40:35.233
If you've never had a drink
before, now's the time 'cause...

01:40:35.317 --> 01:40:36.858
Drink. Drink!

01:40:36.942 --> 01:40:38.650
Hey! What are you...

01:40:40.442 --> 01:40:41.858
That's your solution?

01:40:41.942 --> 01:40:44.108
I gotta die here with you,
and sober!

01:41:07.817 --> 01:41:09.442
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

01:42:02.692 --> 01:42:04.108
Hey, Nathan?

01:42:05.567 --> 01:42:07.483
Nathan?

01:42:07.567 --> 01:42:09.317
Nathan, are you okay?

01:42:33.275 --> 01:42:34.358
Dad?

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:36.983
Dad!

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:38.858
Dad!

01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:50.525
Hi. Um, it was, um...
Madison's idea.

01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:53.150
Shut up, Josh.

01:42:53.275 --> 01:42:56.983
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

01:42:57.067 --> 01:42:58.400
Bernie, meet Dad.

01:42:58.483 --> 01:42:59.858
Dad. Uh, Bernie.

01:42:59.942 --> 01:43:01.858
Um, it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:05.025
I was wondering if I
could invite you onto my podcast

01:43:05.108 --> 01:43:08.358
to talk about the Monarch
facility in Roswell because...

01:43:14.275 --> 01:43:15.608
It's amazing. It happened...

01:43:29.442 --> 01:43:31.067
Jia? Jia!

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.275
Heads up, guys! He's coming
around for his morning walk.

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:39.420
