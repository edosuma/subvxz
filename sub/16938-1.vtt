00:58.590 --> 01:00.148
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05.063 --> 01:06.496
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11.903 --> 01:13.461
<i>Bastard!</i>

02:28.913 --> 02:30.380
Hello?

02:33.485 --> 02:34.952
Hello?

02:37.288 --> 02:39.620
Jerry, is that you?

02:43.395 --> 02:45.488
Jerry, it's you, isn't it?

02:46.898 --> 02:48.490
Oh, you son of a bitch.

04:25.296 --> 04:27.093
Jerry? Fuck you.

04:45.950 --> 04:48.646
Where are you? Did you get out?

04:51.189 --> 04:53.714
You know what, if you're gonna call me,
you might as well say something.

04:53.825 --> 04:56.316
'Cause all you do this way is freak me out.

04:57.595 --> 05:00.860
You know what? I don't need this shit.
You fucking hard-leg.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.268
I can call the cops, you know.

05:04.369 --> 05:08.066
Oh, they trace it to you,
you're busted back direct, you know?

05:09.207 --> 05:10.606
I got a gun.

07:00.218 --> 07:01.515
Excuse me.

07:47.465 --> 07:49.330
Four Coors and a Jack.

07:52.403 --> 07:53.495
Damn, you're jumpy.

07:53.604 --> 07:57.005
Four shots of Wild Turkey. Make it snappy!

07:57.108 --> 07:59.133
- You still coming over tonight?
- Of course I am.

07:59.243 --> 08:02.508
- There's a party at Caldwell's after.
- I'm not going to no party.

08:02.613 --> 08:05.912
- Suit yourself.
- I wish you'd come over more.

08:06.017 --> 08:08.485
Are you forgetting about
my significant trouble at home?

08:08.586 --> 08:12.044
- Bring her.
- She's too touchy about the custody.

08:12.156 --> 08:14.624
- Yeah, how's that going?
- Back to court a week from Friday.

08:14.726 --> 08:16.626
But I don't think the state's too hot

08:16.728 --> 08:19.253
on reuniting children with their beautiful,
lesbian mothers.

08:19.363 --> 08:21.661
Probably could've picked a place other
than Oklahoma to be a homo.

08:21.766 --> 08:25.031
Like we picked this place? She's not going
anywhere unless that baby boy is here.

08:25.136 --> 08:29.334
I like Lavoice. She's a character.
I knew more characters a few years back.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.431
Like in here, man,
it used to be all great people.

08:31.542 --> 08:35.501
- Now it's a bunch of damn career women.
- If you call menopause a career.

08:38.616 --> 08:40.846
When you drop those off,
come to the jukebox.

08:40.952 --> 08:43.147
I want to introduce you to somebody.

09:16.654 --> 09:19.521
Be cool, okay?
She's a little touchy with strangers.

09:20.324 --> 09:22.451
Oh, I understand.

09:34.639 --> 09:37.802
- You think he's good-looking?
- Ted Bundy was good-looking.

09:39.977 --> 09:42.343
Oh, look at you.

09:42.446 --> 09:45.540
- Come to the party with us.
- Ah, I'm too fucked up.

09:48.286 --> 09:50.914
Look at you. You're such a horn-dog.

10:07.905 --> 10:11.238
- What the fuck is he doing here?
- He's going to the party with me.

10:11.342 --> 10:13.333
What kind of shit's he into?

10:14.512 --> 10:16.480
Dude, he's all right. He's just quiet.

10:16.581 --> 10:19.141
Well, I don't know him.
What if he's an ax murderer or...

10:19.250 --> 10:21.309
No, he's harmless. He's just hanging out.

10:21.419 --> 10:24.582
Don't bring people by here, R.C.
I don't like it.

10:28.826 --> 10:31.920
- He's been calling again.
- What does he want?

10:32.029 --> 10:35.021
Fuck if I know. He don't say nothing.
He just breathes.

10:35.132 --> 10:37.157
How do you know it's him?

10:37.268 --> 10:39.168
Who else would it be?

10:39.270 --> 10:41.295
Oh, then you're not sure.

10:41.405 --> 10:43.305
I know it's him.

10:43.407 --> 10:45.875
The calls started right after he got out.

10:45.977 --> 10:48.537
Hey, you gotta be careful.
This guy's dangerous.

10:48.646 --> 10:52.412
- I know it.
- I can't believe they let him out.

10:52.516 --> 10:54.711
I thought he'd kill somebody in there
and they'd throw away the key.

10:54.819 --> 10:56.753
Were you gonna give somebody else
a chance in there?

10:56.854 --> 11:00.381
- I've never been so lucky.
- If he comes by, you can't let him in.

11:00.491 --> 11:03.517
- If he don't come by?
- I'm not an ax murderer.

11:03.628 --> 11:06.096
Do you know it's been two years?

11:06.197 --> 11:07.960
Maybe you should
get bars on your windows.

11:08.065 --> 11:10.625
Oh, great.
Maybe you can just throw peanuts at me

11:10.735 --> 11:13.670
to catch in my mouth, like...

11:13.771 --> 11:16.968
- You can get an attack dog.
- I can take care of myself.

11:17.074 --> 11:19.565
- He's not gonna be satisfied...
- I'm not an ax murderer.

11:19.677 --> 11:21.736
- Maybe I do need a dog. What'd you say?
- Can I use the phone?

11:21.846 --> 11:22.813
Sure.

11:23.915 --> 11:27.715
- I'm not an ax murderer.
- I didn't really think you were.

11:27.818 --> 11:29.718
- Oh, okay.
- Is Lavoice there?

11:29.820 --> 11:31.913
- Here you go.
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:32.023 --> 11:34.617
A big dyke named Lavoice, all right?

11:37.128 --> 11:40.723
- You're very beautiful.
- Huh?

11:40.831 --> 11:42.696
I said you're very beautiful.

11:45.236 --> 11:48.637
- Thank you.
- He said what? Speak up.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.197
Are you all right?

11:51.309 --> 11:54.210
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

11:54.312 --> 11:57.247
I just don't take compliments real well.

11:57.348 --> 11:59.714
Yeah, yeah, look. Yeah, I'm out of here.

12:00.217 --> 12:03.345
I gotta go. Some guy grabbed Lavoice
or squeezed something,

12:03.454 --> 12:05.854
and she slapped him,
so he threatened her or some shit.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.983
- I hate to eat and run. Saddle up.
- Oh, I've changed my mind.

12:09.093 --> 12:11.027
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'll just go from here.

12:11.128 --> 12:13.221
- Will you call me?
- I will see you at work.

12:13.331 --> 12:15.526
- No, call me.
- All right.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.430
- Promise?
- Yes.

12:17.535 --> 12:19.696
And we'll do something this week.

12:21.672 --> 12:24.436
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

12:28.179 --> 12:30.147
The best thing you can do,
I think, is just relax

12:30.247 --> 12:31.839
and try to get him to have a drink.

12:31.949 --> 12:35.783
And if you get really, really nervous,
you can just come to the party, right?

12:35.886 --> 12:37.251
I'm not coming to that party.

12:37.355 --> 12:39.516
You're gonna be, like,
kicking some guy's ass.

12:39.623 --> 12:43.115
- There'll be blood and stuff.
- I'm not gonna kick anybody's ass.

12:45.129 --> 12:47.689
- Have fun.
- See you later.

13:04.849 --> 13:07.283
- You want one last drink?
- I guess I'll go.

13:07.385 --> 13:09.410
Yeah, I should go to bed.

13:12.123 --> 13:15.058
You've known each other a while?

13:15.159 --> 13:17.093
A few years, I guess.

13:17.194 --> 13:19.253
I just met her tonight.

13:24.935 --> 13:28.166
Are you sure you don't want a drink?
People who don't drink make me nervous.

13:28.272 --> 13:31.935
Well, I make people nervous anyway.

13:32.043 --> 13:35.604
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I pick up on things, I think.

13:35.713 --> 13:38.181
That makes people uncomfortable.

13:38.282 --> 13:41.479
- "Pick up on things"?
- Things not apparent.

13:43.788 --> 13:46.120
That's a talent.

13:48.259 --> 13:50.454
What do you pick up on from me?

13:51.796 --> 13:54.162
You're lonely. I know that much.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.225
That hardly makes you Jeane Dixon.

13:57.334 --> 13:59.234
Who's Jeane Dixon?

13:59.336 --> 14:01.031
That woman.

14:01.138 --> 14:03.072
You know.

14:03.174 --> 14:08.441
That psychic. That woman who said to
Teddy Kennedy that Jack'd get shot.

14:14.051 --> 14:17.680
- I'd like to see you again.
- How do you mean?

14:17.788 --> 14:20.757
I mean, see you again, what I said.

14:23.527 --> 14:26.291
- I don't know.
- Okay.

14:26.397 --> 14:28.729
I don't party like this every night,
so don't be thinking...

14:28.833 --> 14:31.802
- No, I just wanted to see you.
- Why?

14:31.902 --> 14:35.861
Why do people like to see each other?
I mean, I don't want anything weird.

14:41.045 --> 14:42.569
A man's the last thing I need.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.807
I don't want to go to bed with you.

14:44.915 --> 14:48.282
Well, don't butter me up or nothing.

14:48.385 --> 14:51.320
Well, I'm not good for much anyway.

14:51.422 --> 14:54.687
- How do you mean?
- Women aren't really my bag.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.654
You a homo?

14:58.762 --> 15:00.696
I'm not anything, really. I'm done with that.

15:00.798 --> 15:03.198
I'm just looking for a friend.

15:04.768 --> 15:08.033
- You a con?
- No, ma'am.

15:08.139 --> 15:11.302
Hell, don't call me "ma'am."
Makes me feel like your mom.

15:11.408 --> 15:14.309
- You're not old enough to be my mother.
- Good.

15:14.411 --> 15:16.606
She's dead, anyway.

15:16.714 --> 15:18.443
Sorry.

15:18.549 --> 15:20.881
She's been dead a long time.

15:24.021 --> 15:26.046
You don't sound like
you're from Oklahoma.

15:26.157 --> 15:28.250
I'm from Beaver.

15:28.359 --> 15:31.487
Well, we're all from beaver, ain't we?

15:31.595 --> 15:34.530
- Pardon?
- Skip it.

15:35.733 --> 15:38.793
It's up in the Panhandle.

15:38.903 --> 15:40.803
My dad's a preacher up there.

15:40.905 --> 15:44.136
- Yeah? What kind of church?
- Doesn't have a church.

15:44.241 --> 15:46.869
Well, where does he meet his people?

15:46.977 --> 15:49.241
He doesn't have any, really.

16:12.203 --> 16:16.606
First day I moved in here, I meant to
take that piece of shit down, and...

16:16.707 --> 16:19.039
I kind of got to where I like it.

16:19.143 --> 16:21.111
There's stuff in it.

16:21.212 --> 16:23.703
- "Stuff"?
- Hidden stuff.

16:23.814 --> 16:26.044
You mean, like a...

16:28.686 --> 16:31.177
What do you mean?

16:31.288 --> 16:34.121
People and things,

16:36.227 --> 16:37.626
if you really look at it.

16:37.728 --> 16:40.492
You gotta look at it hard enough,
you'll see it.

16:42.266 --> 16:44.200
That's weird.

16:44.301 --> 16:46.269
Did you hear that?

16:47.638 --> 16:49.833
No, I don't hear nothing.

16:49.940 --> 16:51.407
Listen.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.735
You're hearing things.

17:01.252 --> 17:02.651
"Helskatoot."

17:02.753 --> 17:06.119
- What is that? Is that...
- Goddamn cricket.

17:07.992 --> 17:10.460
Can you tell where it's coming from?

17:10.560 --> 17:13.290
- Sounds like it's...
- It's over here, right?

17:13.396 --> 17:15.422
No.

17:15.531 --> 17:18.126
If you find it, don't kill it. It's bad luck.

17:19.336 --> 17:21.566
Why is that, do you think?

17:21.672 --> 17:25.438
I don't know. Some smart-ass cricket
probably made it up.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.242
- It's in the bathroom.
- Really?

17:29.346 --> 17:32.179
Yeah. I bet it's...

17:43.060 --> 17:44.755
- It's out here.
- Where?

17:44.862 --> 17:47.558
I don't know. Up there.

17:49.466 --> 17:52.560
It's the smoke alarm.
Battery's probably dead.

17:56.507 --> 17:58.475
Can you get it?

18:01.478 --> 18:05.107
- Nope.
- Well, kill the son of a bitch.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.649
Not bad luck to kill a smoke alarm.

18:07.751 --> 18:10.242
I need something.

18:10.354 --> 18:11.753
Here you go.

18:26.036 --> 18:28.368
- Success.
- Success.

18:31.075 --> 18:33.873
- You should get rid of that.
- How come?

18:33.977 --> 18:38.641
They're dangerous.
They have Americium-241 in them.

18:38.749 --> 18:40.683
- What's that?
- It's an element.

18:40.784 --> 18:43.514
A radioactive element.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.487
- No shit?
- More radioactive than plutonium.

18:48.759 --> 18:51.922
Jesus. No wonder
I feel so lousy all the time.

18:53.397 --> 18:55.194
Yep. Here.

18:55.299 --> 18:57.733
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'll just...

20:02.099 --> 20:04.465
Okay, then. I should go.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.735
Where do you live?

20:08.839 --> 20:11.137
I'm kind of between addresses right now.

20:11.241 --> 20:13.675
- Does that mean you don't got a place?
- No, I got a place to stay.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.836
Where?

20:15.946 --> 20:18.278
Nowhere. Just where I stay.

20:21.985 --> 20:24.476
If you want, you could stay here tonight,
sleep on the couch.

20:24.588 --> 20:26.351
I don't want to put you out.

20:26.457 --> 20:30.223
Somebody sleeping on the couch
when I'm sleeping's not putting me out.

20:32.863 --> 20:35.593
Okay. That'd be nice.

20:35.699 --> 20:37.223
It's just a crappy sofa.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.529
Nice of you.

21:06.230 --> 21:08.357
What's the matter?

21:08.465 --> 21:09.932
Tooth.

21:11.168 --> 21:13.398
- I've got aspirin.
- I'm okay.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.033
Do you mind if I sleep on the floor?

21:47.871 --> 21:49.839
Suit yourself.

23:24.201 --> 23:26.328
Thanks for making coffee.

23:31.441 --> 23:33.033
You're welcome.

23:39.916 --> 23:43.613
How do you stand that little shower?
I could barely get under it.

23:48.825 --> 23:53.626
I ain't mad you didn't come down
to Stringtown to meet me when I got out,

23:55.132 --> 23:57.965
but you might at least
been ready for me back here.

23:58.869 --> 24:01.838
- It don't look like you knew I was here.
- I didn't.

24:01.938 --> 24:04.907
- You didn't get my letter?
- No.

24:08.912 --> 24:11.847
You look good. Have you lost weight?

24:11.948 --> 24:14.212
- Not really.
- Yeah, you did.

24:16.753 --> 24:19.881
You got anything sweet around here?
Oreos or something?

24:19.990 --> 24:23.426
I got a sweet tooth, you know?

24:23.527 --> 24:26.394
Oreos? Graham cracker, maybe?

24:26.496 --> 24:29.465
I was gonna get you some flowers.

24:31.001 --> 24:33.162
Jerry, get out.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.898
Oh, I just got here.

24:38.475 --> 24:40.705
I got some business to clear up
down in Healdton.

24:40.811 --> 24:44.804
It's gonna take me a week or two.
Then I'll be back up.

24:44.915 --> 24:46.041
I ain't got a whole lot of shit,

24:46.149 --> 24:49.949
so you don't have to go
rearranging the furniture or anything.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.287
You ain't seen Mickey, have you?
I hear he's looking for me.

24:56.393 --> 24:58.953
- He get his parole, too?
- He did this time.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.496
He's an egg-sucking son of a bitch.

25:01.598 --> 25:04.590
- He might show up here.
- No, he won't.

25:04.701 --> 25:07.534
Yeah, I know you two have always
been a little sweet on each other.

25:07.637 --> 25:09.901
Now, don't think I didn't notice that.

25:10.006 --> 25:13.464
'Cause I did, I saw it...
Little looks, you know, touches.

25:14.544 --> 25:16.512
Is that why you ratted him out?

25:18.615 --> 25:20.412
Yeah.

25:26.590 --> 25:29.184
It is so fucking dark in here, isn't it?

25:41.605 --> 25:43.766
Still snorting this shit?

25:43.874 --> 25:45.842
Apparently.

25:46.777 --> 25:49.245
No wonder you got so goddamn skinny.

25:50.347 --> 25:52.941
I didn't get skinnier. You just got fatter.

25:54.518 --> 25:56.486
Ah, you crack me up.

25:57.521 --> 26:00.217
- You still working at that honky-tonk?
- You know I am.

26:00.323 --> 26:02.553
Still running with that little queer gal?

26:02.659 --> 26:05.150
- Her name's R.C.
- R.C., yeah.

26:05.262 --> 26:08.925
R.C. You ain't gone queer on me now,
are you?

26:09.032 --> 26:11.967
- You better believe it.
- 'Cause you...

26:12.068 --> 26:14.832
You know what'd happen if I...
If I really thought that.

26:14.938 --> 26:16.599
Don't you threaten me.

26:16.706 --> 26:18.901
I'd get another court order
if I thought it'd do any good.

26:19.009 --> 26:22.445
- Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
- You knocked my door down.

26:22.546 --> 26:25.947
- You wouldn't open it.
- I don't have to.

26:28.685 --> 26:31.279
I ain't interested in this history, Aggie.

26:31.388 --> 26:33.822
I got bigger fish to fry.

26:33.924 --> 26:35.983
You tried to kill me.

26:36.092 --> 26:40.153
That was a rough one, yeah.
I was bad to drink back then.

26:40.263 --> 26:42.823
Oh, back before you found God?

26:44.034 --> 26:47.470
- Who was that boy here last night?
- You been watching my place?

26:47.571 --> 26:51.234
- I saw him leave.
- Calling me eight times a day.

26:51.341 --> 26:54.071
- I haven't called you once.
- Right.

26:55.445 --> 26:57.709
- Who was he?
- Nobody.

26:57.814 --> 27:02.478
"Nobody." Just "nobody"
leaving at 10:00 in the morning?

27:02.586 --> 27:05.384
- Must've spent the night.
- "Must've spent the night."

27:05.488 --> 27:08.753
- Did I do something wrong?
- Oh, I don't know. Did you?

27:10.260 --> 27:13.821
- You're ridiculous.
- Huh? Did you do something wrong?

27:15.332 --> 27:17.766
Goss, don't do this.

27:17.868 --> 27:20.359
- I ain't doing nothing.
- I just don't wanna go back over...

27:20.470 --> 27:21.767
I ain't going back over nothing!

27:21.872 --> 27:26.639
I'm starting to get the feeling that
maybe you ain't too happy to see me, girl.

27:27.844 --> 27:30.642
I missed you.

27:30.747 --> 27:33.045
Didn't you miss me?

27:33.149 --> 27:35.549
I can't say I did. No.

27:37.454 --> 27:39.115
That hurts.

27:40.457 --> 27:43.824
- I waited two years for this.
- Don't give me that.

27:43.927 --> 27:44.894
No, it's the God's honest truth.

27:44.995 --> 27:48.692
I've been waiting two years for this shit.
For you.

27:51.234 --> 27:54.397
You ain't getting shy on me, are ya?
We're gonna have to get over that.

27:54.504 --> 27:58.565
You know what, Goss? I can't tell
if you're fucking serious with this shit!

27:58.675 --> 28:00.540
I hate you!

28:00.644 --> 28:05.843
Oh, God, I wish to Christ I had just taken
Lloyd and gone out to San Diego like...

28:08.919 --> 28:10.853
I was really looking forward to seeing you!

28:10.954 --> 28:14.151
But you know not to mention
his fucking name around me.

28:16.226 --> 28:18.319
I ain't the one who lost him!

28:18.428 --> 28:21.829
Now, whose fucking fault
is it you got slapped, huh?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.992
- Mine.
- That's fucking right, it's your fault.

28:28.705 --> 28:30.935
Now, you got some time

28:31.041 --> 28:33.100
to get your ducks in a line
before I come back here.

28:33.209 --> 28:36.178
Maybe by the next time I come home,

28:36.279 --> 28:38.611
you'll be a little bit nicer to me,
you hear me?

28:38.715 --> 28:40.478
Huh?

28:40.583 --> 28:43.074
We can have a civilized conversation.

28:44.287 --> 28:46.778
- You hear me talking to you?
- Yeah.

29:06.643 --> 29:09.305
- Hidy.
- Hello.

29:11.214 --> 29:13.045
Come on in.

29:15.652 --> 29:17.552
- Jerry Goss.
- Hi.

29:17.654 --> 29:19.519
Hi.

29:19.622 --> 29:21.317
Didn't catch the name.

29:21.424 --> 29:23.324
Peter.

29:23.426 --> 29:24.916
"Peter"?

29:25.028 --> 29:27.053
Just plain old "Peter"?

29:27.163 --> 29:30.724
- Goss...
- Peter Evans.

29:30.834 --> 29:34.429
"Peter Evans." Okay.

29:36.973 --> 29:39.066
Where's your purse, Aggie?

29:39.175 --> 29:40.904
It's under the bed.

30:11.141 --> 30:12.870
I love you so much.

30:16.513 --> 30:18.777
I'll see you real soon.

30:25.822 --> 30:27.790
Peter Piper.

30:29.859 --> 30:31.656
Excuse me, Pete.

30:50.313 --> 30:52.144
Oh, what a punch.

30:52.248 --> 30:54.716
Are you okay?

30:54.818 --> 30:57.548
Fuck, he's a big, old boy.

30:57.654 --> 31:00.782
Do you need anything?
Let me get you a rag.

31:00.890 --> 31:03.358
Maybe a couple of those aspirin.

31:12.535 --> 31:15.333
Can I... Can I have a couple for my tooth?

31:23.780 --> 31:25.680
Thanks for helping me.

31:25.782 --> 31:27.977
I didn't really do anything.

31:29.219 --> 31:31.210
Where'd you go?

31:32.055 --> 31:34.114
I woke up, and I thought...

31:34.424 --> 31:37.416
I went to get us some food.

31:37.527 --> 31:40.223
I hope you don't mind I took the key.

31:40.330 --> 31:42.594
No, that's all right.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.958
Who was that guy?

31:48.071 --> 31:50.835
My ex. He's a nut.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.943
Would you maybe make me
a vodka and coke?

31:55.044 --> 31:57.205
I don't have to work tonight.

32:05.555 --> 32:07.523
How long were you married?

32:09.659 --> 32:12.389
Long enough to still get scared at night.

32:12.495 --> 32:14.963
- Do you have any kids?
- No.

32:38.288 --> 32:40.415
I don't like that guy.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.582
I don't like that he hit you.

32:44.127 --> 32:46.425
I can't say I'm wild about it myself.

32:48.364 --> 32:50.832
He said he's coming back here.

32:50.934 --> 32:52.834
Eventually.

32:52.936 --> 32:54.904
Maybe you need some kind of security.

32:55.004 --> 32:57.734
I can take care of myself.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.331
Why do you get scared at night?

33:00.443 --> 33:04.675
- I was just kidding.
- You should be scared.

33:04.781 --> 33:06.908
How come?

33:07.016 --> 33:10.383
People can do things to you,
things you don't even know about.

33:11.487 --> 33:12.954
Like what?

33:13.056 --> 33:16.651
They try to control you.
They try to force you to act a certain way.

33:16.759 --> 33:18.920
They can drive you crazy, too.

33:27.770 --> 33:31.934
I shouldn't talk about it.
I don't know if it's safe or not.

33:32.976 --> 33:35.911
- I think we're pretty safe here.
- No.

33:36.012 --> 33:38.776
Not really. You're never really safe.

33:40.283 --> 33:43.275
One time, maybe, a long time ago,
people were safe,

33:43.386 --> 33:45.479
but that's all over.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.715
Not anymore, not on this planet.

33:47.824 --> 33:50.452
We'll never really be safe again.

33:50.560 --> 33:55.224
We can't be, not with all the technology,
the chemicals, the information.

33:56.866 --> 33:59.334
Well, I don't like to think about that.

34:00.670 --> 34:04.003
Sometimes, though,
when you're lying in bed at night,

34:05.441 --> 34:07.705
you can feel it...

34:08.678 --> 34:12.444
All the machines,
people working their machines,

34:12.547 --> 34:14.743
the works, humming.

34:16.452 --> 34:19.909
I don't like to go on about it,
'cause it freaks people out.

34:20.023 --> 34:23.186
I wish I didn't think about it either,
but they don't let you forget.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.784
They want you to know they're there.

34:25.895 --> 34:27.726
That what's there?

34:27.830 --> 34:29.764
The machines?

34:31.134 --> 34:33.931
Nothing makes them happier
than knowing people are aware

34:34.036 --> 34:36.266
the machines are up and running.

34:42.145 --> 34:44.079
That's some pretty wild shit.

34:44.179 --> 34:47.047
Yeah, I know you hate me.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.617
You think I hate you?

34:49.819 --> 34:51.650
- I don't know.
- I don't hate you.

34:51.754 --> 34:53.312
Okay.

34:55.190 --> 34:57.056
Why do you think I hate you?

34:57.160 --> 34:59.424
I don't know.

34:59.529 --> 35:03.124
I wouldn't let you stay here if I hated you.

35:03.232 --> 35:06.360
Yeah, I guess that's right, unless...

35:06.469 --> 35:08.699
Yeah, I guess that's right.

35:08.871 --> 35:12.307
- Well, we're friends.
- We are?

35:12.408 --> 35:17.243
I don't have a lot of friends,
but the ones I have, I'm real good to.

35:17.347 --> 35:19.315
But you don't trust me.

35:20.783 --> 35:22.375
Why do you say that?

35:23.319 --> 35:25.981
You lied to me about having children.

35:29.659 --> 35:31.991
How'd you know that?

35:32.095 --> 35:34.723
I told you, I pick up on stuff.

35:36.432 --> 35:40.129
Well, I didn't lie.

35:40.236 --> 35:43.000
I don't have children. I had one.

35:43.973 --> 35:45.702
What happened?

35:45.808 --> 35:48.971
- I lost him.
- He died?

35:51.414 --> 35:53.245
No, he disappeared.

35:53.349 --> 35:55.317
Really?

35:55.418 --> 35:58.512
Yeah, in a grocery store, nine...

36:00.456 --> 36:02.947
10 years ago now.

36:03.059 --> 36:05.653
How old was he?

36:05.762 --> 36:07.320
Six.

36:09.365 --> 36:11.765
Do you have any more questions?
'Cause if you do, ask them now.

36:11.868 --> 36:14.029
I don't wanna talk about it again.

36:16.005 --> 36:18.371
What was his name?

36:20.943 --> 36:22.740
Lloyd.

36:24.280 --> 36:28.080
When did you stop looking for him?

36:28.184 --> 36:31.017
Couple of years ago.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.453
Except in my sleep.
I still look for him in my sleep.

36:34.557 --> 36:37.082
- Do you ever...
- No.

36:41.164 --> 36:43.792
I did lie about one thing.

36:46.035 --> 36:49.527
I do get scared at night.

36:49.639 --> 36:52.665
If you want, you can...

36:52.775 --> 36:54.970
You can stay here again.

36:56.879 --> 36:58.471
Okay.

36:59.515 --> 37:03.645
It's kind of nice having
somebody around, you know?

37:03.753 --> 37:05.721
Different.

37:15.998 --> 37:20.162
I haven't been to bed with a woman
for a long time,

37:20.269 --> 37:22.897
but I think I could go to bed with you.

37:38.387 --> 37:40.355
Come here, boy.

39:21.624 --> 39:24.525
Motherfucker. Fuck!

39:24.627 --> 39:27.755
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- What's the matter?

39:27.863 --> 39:30.354
Fucking bug! A fucking bug bite!

39:30.466 --> 39:33.594
- A bug?
- Where are you, little motherfucker?

39:33.703 --> 39:36.638
- What kind of bug?
- Look at these bites.

39:39.875 --> 39:42.173
Jesus, those look like spider bites.

39:42.278 --> 39:44.337
Well, I felt it a second ago.

39:44.447 --> 39:47.007
It's like a bedbug or some shit.

39:47.116 --> 39:49.744
- Maybe you killed it.
- No, I had it between my fingers,

39:49.852 --> 39:51.820
but it squiggled out.

39:56.125 --> 39:58.252
Pull back the sheet and find it.

40:05.668 --> 40:08.762
Ah, little fucker!
I was just about to fall asleep.

40:08.871 --> 40:11.066
I don't see it.

40:11.173 --> 40:12.435
- There.
- What?

40:12.541 --> 40:14.202
Right there.

40:14.310 --> 40:17.177
- Where?
- There.

40:17.413 --> 40:19.438
- Where?
- There. You see it?

40:19.548 --> 40:22.142
- What?
- Right there.

40:22.251 --> 40:25.516
- This?
- No. This. That there.

40:25.621 --> 40:28.021
- Well...
- There! Right there, Agnes!

40:28.124 --> 40:30.058
- It's right there!
- Don't get all upset.

40:30.159 --> 40:32.821
- But do you see it?
- Well, I don't know.

40:32.928 --> 40:35.055
Right there.

40:35.164 --> 40:37.428
It's really small.

40:37.533 --> 40:39.694
Well, I guess. What is that?

40:39.802 --> 40:41.235
It's a fucking bug.

40:41.337 --> 40:43.965
No, I know that. What kind of bug?

40:45.141 --> 40:47.803
- Like an aphid.
- An aphid?

40:47.910 --> 40:51.073
An aphid is like a, a...

40:53.449 --> 40:56.043
- A bedbug?
- No.

40:56.152 --> 40:58.416
Well, yeah, kind of. More like a louse.

40:58.521 --> 41:02.184
- Louse? Oh, lice.
- Not like head lice. More like plant lice.

41:02.291 --> 41:05.192
- Oh, like a termite.
- No, that's more like a thrip.

41:05.294 --> 41:07.728
- "Thrip"?
- Like a termite.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.492
- You mean "tick"?
- No, a tick's like a flea.

41:10.599 --> 41:12.829
A thrip's like a termite.

41:12.935 --> 41:15.233
- What's a bedbug like?
- A bedbug.

41:15.337 --> 41:17.567
No, I mean, what is a bedbug?

41:17.673 --> 41:19.664
A bedbug.

41:19.775 --> 41:22.437
I thought that was a nickname.

41:22.545 --> 41:25.343
- This is an aphid.
- A plant lice?

41:25.448 --> 41:28.474
- I think so.
- And they bite?

41:28.584 --> 41:31.348
This one sure did.

41:31.454 --> 41:33.820
Well, maybe it's not really
an orchid or whatever.

41:33.923 --> 41:36.721
- Aphid.
- Oh, aphid fucking schmafid.

41:36.826 --> 41:41.195
Whatever. Could you just kill it
so I can get some sleep?

41:41.297 --> 41:44.391
- Fucker.
- Oh, that showed him.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.695
- Hold on. Get up.
- How come?

41:46.802 --> 41:49.930
- There might be more.
- There's not. We would've seen them.

41:50.039 --> 41:52.940
- You almost didn't see that one.
- Well, it was very small.

41:53.042 --> 41:55.875
That's my point, Agnes. They're small.
We may not have seen them.

41:55.978 --> 41:58.469
Oh, Jesus!

41:58.581 --> 42:02.039
Look at my wrist. You wanna wake up
in the morning and find this?

42:03.586 --> 42:05.554
It's morning, and now I am awake.

42:05.654 --> 42:07.417
Sort of.

42:08.691 --> 42:11.819
- Do they travel in packs or something?
- "Packs"?

42:11.927 --> 42:18.298
Well, if there's one, do you have reason to
suspect there's others with them?

42:18.400 --> 42:21.460
Makes sense.
And you're assuming it's a "him"...

42:21.570 --> 42:23.561
Some rogue aphid on his travels

42:23.672 --> 42:27.836
instead of some matriarchal type
with a big brood somewhere.

42:27.943 --> 42:30.537
- "Matriarchal"?
- You ever watch "Big Valley"?

42:30.646 --> 42:32.807
- Sure.
- Barbara Stanwyck?

42:34.016 --> 42:35.278
Like her.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.584
Where'd you learn to talk like that anyway?

42:40.689 --> 42:42.554
School.

42:42.658 --> 42:45.752
- I was home-schooled.
- No shit?

42:45.861 --> 42:48.591
My father didn't believe in school.

42:48.697 --> 42:52.633
Must've done a pretty good job,
throwing around words like "matriarchal."

42:52.735 --> 42:55.260
Well, I learned that from "Big Valley".

42:56.906 --> 42:58.373
This is clean.

43:01.677 --> 43:03.804
You got a nice body.

43:05.114 --> 43:07.173
So do you.

43:07.283 --> 43:09.945
Better looking without clothes on it.

43:10.052 --> 43:12.452
I agree.

43:12.555 --> 43:15.683
You know how some people look nice,
and then you see them naked

43:15.791 --> 43:17.691
and they're a big disappointment?

43:17.793 --> 43:19.420
Yeah.

43:21.730 --> 43:25.393
Why'd you say you weren't
one for the ladies?

43:25.501 --> 43:26.798
It's true.

43:28.003 --> 43:30.096
Could've fooled me.

43:31.407 --> 43:32.999
You're different.

43:33.876 --> 43:35.844
How am I different?

43:37.346 --> 43:39.906
You don't...

43:40.015 --> 43:42.176
You don't speak the codes.

43:42.284 --> 43:45.515
How long has it been since
you was with a woman?

43:45.621 --> 43:48.749
I don't know. A few years, I guess.

43:48.858 --> 43:50.621
Must've gotten a bad one.

43:50.726 --> 43:53.957
No. I just decided
it wasn't worth it anymore.

43:56.532 --> 44:00.059
- What wasn't?
- You have a center, right?

44:00.169 --> 44:02.194
I mean...

44:02.304 --> 44:07.298
A place inside of you that's just you,
that hasn't been spoiled.

44:07.409 --> 44:11.903
And I think it's really important to try and
keep that space sacred.

44:12.014 --> 44:14.278
In some sense. On some level.

44:14.383 --> 44:17.284
But sex or relationships

44:17.386 --> 44:19.547
cloud that space.

44:19.655 --> 44:21.919
Or they cloud me, I guess,

44:22.024 --> 44:23.651
and make it difficult to be just me,

44:23.759 --> 44:26.887
and not have to worry about

44:26.996 --> 44:29.055
being somebody else.

44:31.467 --> 44:34.436
I sound like a big asshole, don't I?

44:36.038 --> 44:38.029
Not at all.

44:39.575 --> 44:41.736
I like hearing you talk.

44:53.255 --> 44:55.917
- Aren't you gonna answer it?
- No.

44:56.025 --> 44:57.925
- Why not?
- It's Goss.

44:58.027 --> 45:00.120
You were Goss once.

45:02.498 --> 45:03.965
Hello?

45:06.268 --> 45:07.735
Hello?

45:13.208 --> 45:16.075
- Goss, right?
- I don't think so.

45:16.178 --> 45:17.975
What'd they say?

45:18.080 --> 45:20.048
Just static.

45:24.653 --> 45:26.814
- There you go. See?
- Where?

45:26.922 --> 45:29.152
- There.
- I'm sorry. Where?

45:29.258 --> 45:30.885
- Right there.
- Squish him.

45:30.993 --> 45:35.760
There you go again. How do you know
it's not the super-mother aphid,

45:35.864 --> 45:37.525
and she's carrying a million eggs?

45:37.633 --> 45:40.534
Oh! What are plant lice doing in my place?

45:40.636 --> 45:43.127
Biting me, for one thing.

45:43.238 --> 45:46.036
You know what?
I got to get this place sprayed.

45:46.141 --> 45:48.473
I'll do it. I'll buy some stuff tomorrow.

45:48.577 --> 45:51.375
Fuck that. It's their room.
They should pay for it.

45:51.480 --> 45:56.008
- But someone would have to come in.
- Goddamn right, they will.

45:56.118 --> 45:58.348
Well, you do what you want, but I wouldn't.

45:58.454 --> 45:59.682
How come?

46:01.557 --> 46:04.492
- Never mind.
- No, wait. How come?

46:04.593 --> 46:07.153
No, I shouldn't say anything.
It's your place and I don't want to interfere.

46:07.262 --> 46:10.595
Why wouldn't I want someone in my place?
'Cause you're a con?

46:11.500 --> 46:12.831
Why didn't you just tell me when I asked?

46:12.935 --> 46:17.565
I've never been to prison.
I've just got people after me, that's all.

46:17.673 --> 46:20.107
Oh, you've just got people after you.
Well, who?

46:20.209 --> 46:22.268
- I don't want to drag you into it.
- Drag me into what?

46:22.378 --> 46:23.436
Agnes, please.

46:23.545 --> 46:25.308
- I'm not comfortable telling you.
- Drag me into what?

46:25.414 --> 46:27.905
You don't trust me?

46:28.017 --> 46:30.451
- You can trust me. I'm not gonna...
- I trust you. That's not it.

46:30.552 --> 46:34.181
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'll take my chances.

46:34.289 --> 46:36.484
I won't.

46:36.592 --> 46:39.186
So, what, you're going?

46:39.294 --> 46:41.854
Where? You don't even got nowhere to go.

46:41.964 --> 46:43.625
I'll be fine.

46:43.732 --> 46:46.394
Oh, well, all right, then. Just fuck you!

46:48.303 --> 46:50.794
You know what? You may think it's easy for
me to just take you in here,

46:50.906 --> 46:53.898
but I ain't the kind of woman who
moves from man to man.

46:54.009 --> 46:57.775
Fact is, it's been quite a while
since I even had anyone to get close to,

46:57.880 --> 46:59.347
you know what I'm saying?

46:59.448 --> 47:01.541
Not that I need a man.
Oh, I need a man like I need a hole

47:01.650 --> 47:04.210
in the goddamn head, but...

47:04.319 --> 47:08.415
I just get lonely sometimes, you know?

47:08.524 --> 47:10.788
It was kind of nice
having somebody around for a change.

47:10.893 --> 47:12.861
It was different.

47:15.831 --> 47:17.765
Oh, you son of a bitch!

48:03.112 --> 48:04.739
I...

48:05.981 --> 48:08.882
Got in some trouble with the Army.

48:11.053 --> 48:15.319
I was stationed at Sakaka
in the Syrian Desert

48:15.424 --> 48:18.393
during the war, and...

48:18.494 --> 48:20.291
These doctors,

48:20.395 --> 48:23.364
they kept coming in
and giving us shots and pills.

48:23.465 --> 48:25.797
A lot of the guys were getting sick

48:25.901 --> 48:30.770
with vomiting, diarrhea,
migraines, black-outs,

48:30.873 --> 48:34.138
and I was having...
I was having some weird thoughts.

48:37.346 --> 48:41.874
And I started feeling sick,
so they shipped me home

48:41.984 --> 48:44.851
and they put me in this hospital
at Groom Lake

48:44.953 --> 48:48.821
and they started running these...
These tests on me.

48:51.226 --> 48:54.889
And they had every kind of doctor
you could imagine just...

48:56.899 --> 48:59.424
Just probing and jabbing at me

48:59.535 --> 49:02.231
and asking me all these weird questions,

49:03.472 --> 49:05.531
feeding me more pills.

49:05.641 --> 49:08.974
Those fucking doctors were
experimenting on me.

49:10.379 --> 49:11.744
I went AWOL.

49:13.382 --> 49:14.679
I was a lifer, too.

49:14.783 --> 49:17.308
I didn't have anywhere to go.

49:17.419 --> 49:18.943
And they don't respond too well

49:19.054 --> 49:21.318
to some drugged-up guinea pig
just taking off.

49:21.423 --> 49:22.913
I don't know...

49:23.792 --> 49:27.421
That I'm not carrying
a disease or a contagion.

49:27.529 --> 49:29.156
Oh, Jesus.

49:30.432 --> 49:31.990
That's how they start.

49:32.100 --> 49:35.228
Typhoid. Legionnaire's disease,
a government screw-up.

49:35.337 --> 49:38.602
AIDS. With the fucking monkeys in Africa.

49:41.310 --> 49:42.902
They're after me.

49:43.812 --> 49:46.303
These people don't fuck around, Agnes.

49:55.991 --> 49:58.653
I shouldn't have told you that,

49:58.760 --> 50:01.354
but I needed to tell somebody.

50:05.534 --> 50:07.468
And I trust you.

50:07.569 --> 50:10.470
I know we haven't known
each other very long.

50:13.575 --> 50:15.543
I don't want to go.

50:24.686 --> 50:26.381
I don't want to go.

50:37.132 --> 50:41.228
Oh, babe, don't leave me. No.

50:45.340 --> 50:48.571
My... Peter.

53:12.721 --> 53:15.155
Can I help you?

53:15.257 --> 53:17.521
Hidy.

53:17.626 --> 53:18.923
No.

53:19.027 --> 53:20.619
Agnes isn't here.

53:21.930 --> 53:23.898
No shit.

53:23.999 --> 53:27.127
- Where is she, Peter?
- The liquor store, I think.

53:33.041 --> 53:35.236
Goddamn, Peter.

53:35.343 --> 53:38.779
I think if I were a roach,
I'd probably take the hint.

53:44.352 --> 53:48.345
- Where's the TV?
- I don't think she has one.

53:48.457 --> 53:50.584
We had one once.

53:50.692 --> 53:53.058
A 19-inch RCA, sure-touch tuning.

53:54.996 --> 53:58.989
I bought it with the money I made
driving a sausage truck.

53:59.100 --> 54:03.298
I drove that truck
20 hours a day sometimes,

54:03.405 --> 54:06.135
just so I could feed my wife and my kid.

54:06.241 --> 54:08.505
You ever do anything like that?

54:10.378 --> 54:12.778
Who the fuck doesn't have a TV?

54:12.881 --> 54:15.441
How are you supposed to know
what's going on in the world, man?

54:15.550 --> 54:19.509
Jesus, we could be invaded
by Martians or some shit, you know?

54:19.621 --> 54:22.647
Fuck, they could be evacuating
the whole goddamn city right now,

54:22.757 --> 54:26.591
and me and you'd be sitting here
with our thumbs up our asses.

54:29.965 --> 54:31.193
Could be.

54:33.068 --> 54:34.695
Who got this stuff out?

54:34.803 --> 54:36.862
I did, for the microscope.

54:43.979 --> 54:45.947
You little shit.

54:47.616 --> 54:48.776
Well...

54:49.818 --> 54:54.118
You might put it back before Aggie gets
home. She ain't gonna like it very much.

54:56.091 --> 54:57.854
What you working on, Peter?

54:57.959 --> 55:00.223
Just looking at something.

55:00.328 --> 55:02.626
Don't touch that, please. I'm...

55:03.965 --> 55:06.433
- I'm looking in...
- What are you looking at?

55:06.535 --> 55:09.663
- A bug.
- Excuse me. A bug?

55:14.676 --> 55:16.667
Just a...

55:16.778 --> 55:18.336
Just a bug?

55:19.981 --> 55:21.881
In my blood.

55:21.983 --> 55:23.883
Oh, in your blood?

55:23.985 --> 55:25.111
Hey...

55:26.421 --> 55:29.481
You know, you remind me of somebody.

55:31.026 --> 55:33.221
You know who you remind me of?

55:34.129 --> 55:37.826
- Do you know who you remind me of?
- Who do I remind you of?

55:37.933 --> 55:39.696
- This guy I knew in the pen.
- In the pen?

55:39.801 --> 55:41.234
Yeah.

55:41.336 --> 55:43.770
- I just did a deuce for armed robbery.
- Wow.

55:43.872 --> 55:46.500
Guy named Porterfield.

55:46.608 --> 55:48.906
- You're not related to him, are ya?
- I don't believe so.

55:49.010 --> 55:50.978
- "I don't believe tho."
- No.

55:51.079 --> 55:53.172
You know what we called him?

55:54.082 --> 55:55.982
- Do you know what we called him?
- What did you call him?

55:56.084 --> 55:58.348
We called him Mrs. Porterfield.
You kind of...

55:58.453 --> 56:00.717
Kind of remind me of him a little bit.

56:05.293 --> 56:07.591
What the fuck are we looking at?

56:07.796 --> 56:09.491
A bug, in my blood.

56:10.432 --> 56:12.400
- In your blood?
- Yes.

56:12.500 --> 56:15.469
Yeah? Well, I don't see nothing.

56:15.570 --> 56:17.697
- It's very small.
- Yeah, I'll bet it is.

56:17.806 --> 56:20.707
You're pretty much just
jacking off here, aren't you?

56:22.644 --> 56:26.011
Why don't you answer me
when I ask you a question?

56:26.114 --> 56:29.083
I thought that was a rhetorical question.

56:33.655 --> 56:38.115
Do you know what I'd do to you if I ever
found out you were fucking with Agnes?

56:38.226 --> 56:41.718
- Look, I don't know who you are or...
- You don't know who I am?

56:41.830 --> 56:43.491
Didn't we just meet in here
a little while ago?

56:43.598 --> 56:44.622
Yes.

56:44.733 --> 56:47.099
- And you forgot me that quick?
- No.

56:47.202 --> 56:48.362
Well, I remember who the fuck you are!

56:48.470 --> 56:50.563
Right. My point is that I don't want
any trouble with you.

56:50.672 --> 56:52.765
Yeah, well, my point is,
you ain't gonna get no trouble from me.

56:52.874 --> 56:54.136
I'm staying here for a while.

56:54.242 --> 56:56.142
So find someplace else
to do your experiments.

56:56.244 --> 57:00.180
- I don't think you want to stay here.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?

57:00.281 --> 57:02.442
- Place is crawling with these things.
- Oh, right.

57:02.550 --> 57:05.542
- With your little bugs.
- We're infested.

57:05.654 --> 57:07.747
I believe you are, Peter.

57:11.192 --> 57:14.059
You let him in here?

57:14.162 --> 57:15.561
He picked the lock.

57:15.664 --> 57:17.962
- Come here, girl.
- Get the fuck out of here, Jerry!

57:18.066 --> 57:21.763
You look good, baby.
Mustache tickles a little bit.

57:21.870 --> 57:25.362
- That's okay.
- Not mine, yours.

57:25.473 --> 57:28.465
- Jerry, you can't stay here.
- Hey, wait a minute.

57:28.576 --> 57:30.976
I'm just gonna be here for
a little while, hang my hat.

57:31.079 --> 57:32.944
What was the name of that girl
you used to run with?

57:33.048 --> 57:36.142
- Lavoice.
- Lavoice.

57:36.251 --> 57:39.516
I been trying to remember that shit.
I been trying to think. She was a trip.

57:39.621 --> 57:41.213
Remember that time over at Mickey's

57:41.322 --> 57:43.688
she laid up on the balcony
and took a big old shit?

57:43.792 --> 57:47.421
Landed on... Remember that shit?
Landed on a cop car?

57:47.529 --> 57:49.520
That was the funniest shit
I've seen in my fucking life.

57:49.631 --> 57:51.758
It was the pork party.

57:51.866 --> 57:54.994
Was that the fucking pork party?

57:55.103 --> 57:58.038
It was, wasn't it? Aggie, you got to
remember the pork party, baby.

57:58.139 --> 58:01.074
- You know what, Jerry?
- Hey, Mickey had this pork...

58:01.176 --> 58:05.272
Like the can of pork, like Spam or some
shit like they give you in the Army?

58:05.380 --> 58:07.746
That drunk son of a bitch starts throwing it
all over the place.

58:07.849 --> 58:10.477
Next thing you know, end of the night,
he's passed out

58:10.585 --> 58:14.919
on the fucking floor in the kitchen,
pot on his head, pork dripping all over...

58:15.023 --> 58:16.581
I know, that shit's some funny shit!

58:16.691 --> 58:20.024
It's fucking dripping all over his chest,
and he can't get up.

58:20.128 --> 58:22.961
He starts doing one of these numbers
'cause the fucking linoleum and shit

58:23.064 --> 58:24.793
is so fucking greasy he can't...

58:24.899 --> 58:26.059
- Jerry.
- Wait a minute!

58:26.167 --> 58:27.134
Jerry.

58:27.235 --> 58:28.725
- What?
- Get out!

58:30.238 --> 58:32.206
- Are you throwing me out?
- Now.

58:35.343 --> 58:37.971
- Well, I misunderstood.
- Yeah.

58:40.048 --> 58:42.744
You know, I was gonna stay here for
a while, but I guess that's a bad idea,

58:42.851 --> 58:46.548
what, with you being infested with
your little fucking bugs and shit.

58:49.958 --> 58:52.051
I got to admit, though,

58:52.160 --> 58:55.095
I'm disappointed, Aggie.

58:56.331 --> 58:59.232
And you I owe an apology to.

58:59.334 --> 59:01.199
Here I was all this time
thinking you was some

59:01.302 --> 59:03.998
fucking weirdo freeloading,
coke-head son of a bitch.

59:04.105 --> 59:08.041
I had no clue
you were taking such good care of Aggie.

59:10.912 --> 59:13.403
That's important. I appreciate that.

59:13.715 --> 59:15.012
Thank you.

59:16.384 --> 59:18.511
I'll be around.

59:22.257 --> 59:25.055
- Can you believe him?
- Come here and look at this.

59:27.128 --> 59:28.959
- You found it?
- You need to look at this now, please.

59:29.063 --> 59:31.395
- Yeah, police department, please.
- What?

59:32.433 --> 59:34.458
- Stop! Ow!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry.

59:34.569 --> 59:36.867
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police department.

59:36.971 --> 59:38.666
Don't do that, okay? Don't ever do that.

59:38.773 --> 59:41.606
Agnes, it's B and E, plain and simple.
He violated his parole.

59:41.709 --> 59:43.939
- You can't fuck around with this guy.
- It's not that easy.

59:44.045 --> 59:46.343
- Agnes, please.
- Agnes...

59:46.447 --> 59:48.005
- Can you see it?
- What?

59:48.116 --> 59:49.640
- Do you see the bug?
- Yeah.

59:49.751 --> 59:51.514
- Agnes?
- Can you tell what it's doing?

59:51.619 --> 59:53.211
- No, it's kind of...
- It's feeding.

59:53.321 --> 59:56.688
- Feeding? On what?
- My blood. It's feeding off my blood.

59:56.791 --> 59:59.259
- So you're saying that...
- I'm saying it's feeding off my blood.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.294
- It's a parasite.
- Well, we knew that.

01:00:01.396 --> 01:00:03.694
No, we knew they were biting.
Bugs bite for different reasons, see.

01:00:03.798 --> 01:00:06.631
- These are biting for food.
- None of this stuff's working?

01:00:06.734 --> 01:00:10.226
No, they're immune to the sprays.
Thought they might be coke bugs.

01:00:10.338 --> 01:00:12.670
- Couldn't find any in Agnes' stash.
- "Coke bugs"?

01:00:12.774 --> 01:00:15.641
- Bugs you sometimes find in cocaine.
- There are no bugs in cocaine.

01:00:15.743 --> 01:00:18.507
The DEA sprays the larva
on the coca plantations

01:00:18.613 --> 01:00:20.581
in South America, Central America.

01:00:20.682 --> 01:00:23.344
They're genetically engineered
to survive the purification process.

01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:26.249
If they can't wipe out the drugs,
they want to wipe out the users.

01:00:26.354 --> 01:00:28.015
You didn't know about this?
That's hard to believe.

01:00:28.122 --> 01:00:29.146
Thanks for telling me.

01:00:29.257 --> 01:00:31.282
Well, they don't get to all of us.
You don't have them.

01:00:31.392 --> 01:00:32.825
I told you, I checked.
Believe me, if you had them...

01:00:32.927 --> 01:00:35.555
- You've had them before?
- You ask a lot of questions.

01:00:35.663 --> 01:00:38.996
- Maybe we should take this to a lab.
- A lab? What for?

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.761
- Well, find out what it is.
- I know what it is.

01:00:40.869 --> 01:00:42.996
- What is it?
- It's a blood-sucking aphid...

01:00:43.104 --> 01:00:45.902
Look, this aphid business, I don't really...

01:00:46.007 --> 01:00:49.272
- What's that?
- A burrowing aphid. Dig it out.

01:00:49.377 --> 01:00:51.436
- Let me see it. Agnes?
- No!

01:00:51.546 --> 01:00:54.014
- Let me see. Where? Where is it?
- Look, it's right there.

01:00:54.115 --> 01:00:55.639
- Can you see that?
- I don't see it.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.014
- That little speck under the skin.
- I can't see shit, Agnes.

01:00:58.119 --> 01:01:00.019
- Well, it's real itty-bitty!
- Why can't I see it?

01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:02.021
- I don't know! Why can we see it?
- Is it under the skin?

01:01:02.123 --> 01:01:05.559
Give me that thing. I'll dig it out and show
you. You can see it better. It's...

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.389
Place is crawling with them.

01:01:07.495 --> 01:01:10.589
- When I talked to Carl before...
- Wait a minute! You talked to who?

01:01:10.698 --> 01:01:14.031
- Carl, the manager of the motel.
- Why? Whose idea...

01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:16.160
- Just to tell him we were infested...
- Why did you tell him that?

01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:18.000
- Why shouldn't she?
- I didn't tell him nothing...

01:01:18.106 --> 01:01:21.405
Just tell me exactly what you told him.
Exactly.

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:24.967
- Just that there was bugs, and it's weird...
- Yeah? It's weird?

01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:27.274
- So what are you saying?
- Nobody's seen them but us.

01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:30.317
- It's just really weird.
- You've already said that, Agnes.

01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:32.386
- We saw a doctor.
- Oh, Ronnie...

01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:35.047
We had to check out the spots.

01:01:37.558 --> 01:01:39.788
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit, no.

01:01:39.894 --> 01:01:44.228
Okay, either you don't grasp the situation,
or you're just fucking me over, okay?

01:01:44.332 --> 01:01:46.857
No, no.
I didn't say anything to him about you.

01:01:46.968 --> 01:01:49.596
- What kind of doctor?
- He's a dermatologist.

01:01:49.704 --> 01:01:50.932
- What'd he find?
- No bugs.

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:53.564
- You picked them off.
- He said they didn't look like bites.

01:01:53.675 --> 01:01:55.939
Would you please not talk
while I address Agnes?

01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:59.775
- He gave me something for a rash.
- Let me see it. Now.

01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:02.475
It's just a lotion, that's all.

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:04.107
Here.

01:02:04.218 --> 01:02:08.621
I'm not dumb. I didn't say anything
about you. I wouldn't do that to you.

01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:11.515
They got to you, goddamn it.

01:02:11.626 --> 01:02:14.925
- If you're a part of this...
- No! I'm just trying to make sense...

01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:16.997
Okay, you tell me.
Do we have the bugs or not?

01:02:17.098 --> 01:02:20.761
- I'm just looking for an explanation!
- Do we have bugs or not?

01:02:20.868 --> 01:02:22.460
- I don't know.
- It's not a matter of opinion.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:25.334
- An organism just is or isn't.
- Right.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.876
So, are there bugs or aren't there?

01:02:28.977 --> 01:02:30.945
- Some...
- No, don't give me "some" bugs.

01:02:31.045 --> 01:02:32.410
Presence of bugs, absence of bugs.

01:02:32.513 --> 01:02:35.607
The sign outside says "vacancies"
or "no vacancies."

01:02:35.717 --> 01:02:38.208
It doesn't say "possibility of vacancies."

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:42.585
Now, do we have bugs or not?

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:43.748
Yeah.

01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:49.292
- Then your doctor is lying to you.
- Peter, do you have sores like hers?

01:02:49.397 --> 01:02:51.228
His are worse.

01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:54.665
Show her. Show her, Peter.

01:02:54.769 --> 01:02:57.033
Show me.

01:02:57.138 --> 01:02:59.504
Oh, God. Did you put something on that?

01:02:59.607 --> 01:03:02.838
Oh, my God. You think an aphid did that?

01:03:02.944 --> 01:03:05.879
- I know what did it to me.
- Aphids can't bite.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.505
- You know a lot about aphids?
- No.

01:03:08.616 --> 01:03:10.516
- Do you know anything about aphids?
- No.

01:03:10.618 --> 01:03:11.744
We do.

01:03:13.788 --> 01:03:14.948
Ronnie!

01:03:15.656 --> 01:03:18.887
Ronnie, you haven't even
told Peter your news yet.

01:03:18.993 --> 01:03:22.588
They got custody of Lavoice's kid!
Isn't that great?

01:03:22.697 --> 01:03:25.257
Ronnie's gonna be an aunt
or a mother or whatever.

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:27.266
- That's terrific.
- Listen to me.

01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:30.337
There are no bugs.
There are no bugs on this microscope,

01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:33.134
there's no bugs on your skin,
in your skin, in this room.

01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:34.936
There are no fucking bugs!

01:03:35.043 --> 01:03:37.603
- That's odd, actually.
- I was with the doctor, Peter.

01:03:37.712 --> 01:03:39.646
- Agnes, tell him what he told you.
- No, I don't...

01:03:39.747 --> 01:03:42.181
He said her wounds were self-inflicted,
that she did it to herself,

01:03:42.283 --> 01:03:44.046
just like you, or maybe you did it to her.

01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:46.814
- Oh, you think I would do that to her?
- I don't know what your deal is.

01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:49.389
I don't know who the fuck you are
or what you're about.

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:52.015
But all I know is I regret
bringing you in here.

01:03:52.126 --> 01:03:53.650
I can't do nothing about you,

01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:56.662
but suggest that you get some serious
fucking medical attention!

01:03:56.764 --> 01:04:01.064
But I can do something about my friend,
and by God, I intend to.

01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:04.730
You even try to stop me and I'll introduce
you to an old friend of yours.

01:04:04.839 --> 01:04:08.138
- What does that mean?
- Somebody's been asking about you.

01:04:08.242 --> 01:04:09.903
- Who?
- Dr. Sweet.

01:04:11.979 --> 01:04:14.345
Who's Dr. Sweet?
What are you talking about?

01:04:14.449 --> 01:04:17.782
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, I do. Groom Lake.

01:04:17.885 --> 01:04:19.944
Your friend is gonna turn me in.

01:04:20.054 --> 01:04:22.648
- Tell me, what...
- He's asking about Peter at the bar.

01:04:22.757 --> 01:04:23.781
What'd he tell you?

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:25.882
Not much. But apparently,
I didn't know you were staying here,

01:04:25.993 --> 01:04:27.927
so maybe
I should have asked some more questions.

01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:29.587
But he's obviously not somebody
you wanna meet

01:04:29.697 --> 01:04:31.927
or he would've known where to find you.
Peter.

01:04:32.033 --> 01:04:35.992
- Quit playing games. Tell him...
- I am not playing, Agnes!

01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:38.470
You know what? She would never do that.
She would never do that, Peter.

01:04:38.573 --> 01:04:40.370
- You try me.
- She wouldn't. No.

01:04:40.475 --> 01:04:42.272
- You don't mean it, Ronnie.
- Try me.

01:04:42.376 --> 01:04:46.176
I'm stunned that you think

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.646
I would try to stop Agnes
from going with you.

01:04:48.749 --> 01:04:51.582
I'm only staying here because I was invited.

01:04:51.686 --> 01:04:53.278
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.

01:04:53.387 --> 01:04:55.981
I wouldn't attempt to keep somebody
where they don't want to be.

01:04:56.090 --> 01:05:00.083
Agnes is an adult
and she is free to do as she pleases.

01:05:00.194 --> 01:05:01.821
I thought you'd see it that way.

01:05:01.929 --> 01:05:04.454
As for Dr. Sweet, tell him what you wish.

01:05:04.565 --> 01:05:06.465
I have no doubt he already
knows where I am.

01:05:06.567 --> 01:05:09.400
- Right.
- But as for your contention

01:05:09.504 --> 01:05:12.598
there are no bugs, I disagree.

01:05:12.707 --> 01:05:14.766
You're gonna stay with me for a while.
I want you to pack a bag.

01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:17.709
Agnes, look at me.
I want you to pack a bag.

01:05:24.519 --> 01:05:26.817
Peter! Are they bad?

01:05:29.957 --> 01:05:31.424
Get off!

01:05:32.593 --> 01:05:34.060
Help!

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:39.188
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing it?

01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:42.568
Stop it! Stop it!

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.661
Stop it! Stop it!

01:05:44.772 --> 01:05:46.740
Peter! Oh, my God! It's okay! It's okay!

01:05:46.841 --> 01:05:50.607
It's okay! Stop!

01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:52.576
Oh, my God!

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.011
It's okay.

01:05:54.115 --> 01:05:56.811
It's okay. Oh, my God.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.449
Who do you think you are?

01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:05.117
You come in here and try to take from me
the one thing in the world I have?

01:06:05.226 --> 01:06:08.252
Why can't you just leave me
with one thing?

01:06:08.362 --> 01:06:10.557
This is the only thing in the world I have.

01:06:10.665 --> 01:06:13.429
Why are you trying to take it from me?
Get out of here!

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:16.025
Get out of here and never come back!

01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:25.802
Get out of here!

01:06:41.195 --> 01:06:43.755
Peter, let's leave.

01:06:43.864 --> 01:06:46.025
I can't take it.

01:06:46.133 --> 01:06:47.828
We can't. They're watching.

01:06:47.935 --> 01:06:52.167
But it seems if they knew where you was,
they'd just grab you.

01:06:52.273 --> 01:06:54.969
They're playing with me.

01:06:55.076 --> 01:06:57.044
Maybe we could sneak out.

01:06:58.379 --> 01:07:00.711
It's too risky.

01:07:00.815 --> 01:07:03.579
I have a sister in San Diego.

01:07:03.684 --> 01:07:06.585
She'd take us in till we got on our feet.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:12.889
I was gonna take Lloyd out there,

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:15.326
get away from Goss.

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:18.330
She invited us.

01:07:18.432 --> 01:07:20.798
But I waited too late.

01:07:22.403 --> 01:07:25.600
Who knows?
She probably hates me now, too.

01:07:28.009 --> 01:07:31.103
I can't believe R.C. did that to me.

01:07:31.212 --> 01:07:34.909
I can't imagine what I did
to make her hate me so much.

01:07:35.016 --> 01:07:39.043
Fuck, I don't believe I didn't see it coming
sooner. Spying little bitch.

01:07:42.089 --> 01:07:44.580
I don't know why I love you so much.

01:07:45.259 --> 01:07:47.159
I don't hardly know you, truth be told,

01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:52.130
and we ain't even done that much in bed
except that one night and I don't care.

01:07:56.404 --> 01:07:58.929
Seems all we ever talk about's bugs.

01:08:00.975 --> 01:08:05.139
I guess I'd rather talk with you about bugs
than nothing with nobody.

01:08:07.114 --> 01:08:10.880
Not that I've got much to say,
unless I talk about misery.

01:08:10.985 --> 01:08:14.148
Who wants to hear that? I don't.

01:08:16.223 --> 01:08:19.317
I just get so sick of it.

01:08:19.426 --> 01:08:21.987
My lousy life.
Laundromats and grocery stores

01:08:22.095 --> 01:08:25.087
and dumb marriages and lost kids.

01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:29.461
Lloyd, he's the only good time.

01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:35.736
That's it.

01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:38.368
We're the only ones.
No one else in this motel has bugs.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:40.379
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they're my bugs.

01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:43.973
- I brought them here. They come from me.
- You mean in your clothes?

01:08:44.085 --> 01:08:45.984
No, my skin.

01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:50.113
There's an egg sac under my skin.

01:08:50.224 --> 01:08:52.215
- "Egg sac"?
- That's why they didn't grab me.

01:08:52.326 --> 01:08:55.295
My God.
Where did it come from in the first place?

01:08:55.395 --> 01:08:58.524
The eggs are under my skin.
They hatch, they need air,

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:02.533
they come out, they need food,
they come back, they eat.

01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:06.935
- Well, no. What do you mean?
- Think about it.

01:09:08.242 --> 01:09:10.710
No! They wouldn't have done that to you.

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:13.143
Who are they gonna do it to, a pig?

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:15.841
They have to try it on a human to see
if it works before they spray Baghdad.

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:17.383
They wouldn't have done that to you.

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:18.917
Oh, right. What was I thinking?

01:09:19.019 --> 01:09:21.613
The government wouldn't conduct
experiments on their own people.

01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:24.486
Like feeding LSD to enlisted men
at Edgewood Arsenal

01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:26.354
or sitting around watching the poor fuckers

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.984
in Tuskegee die from syphilis.

01:09:29.095 --> 01:09:32.189
- Why don't you fucking wake up?
- Where is this egg sac?

01:09:32.299 --> 01:09:33.765
What are you doing...

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:35.961
Oh, my God, Peter!

01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:40.104
Stop it! Stop it!

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:42.801
- The sac's in my tooth.
- Oh, my God! It's not possible!

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:44.171
I had this tooth filled at the base.

01:09:44.278 --> 01:09:47.577
The sadistic sons of bitches
put an insect egg sac under the filling.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.171
- Maybe what we got is a bug problem...
- They're eating me!

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:52.252
I know. I know.

01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:54.821
I'm just trying to play the devil's advocate
thing here, okay?

01:09:54.922 --> 01:09:56.856
- Okay. Okay.
- Maybe, maybe...

01:09:56.957 --> 01:09:58.948
You're looking for a connection
to the Army, so you're...

01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:01.323
- Bullshit. Bullshit.
- Hear me out!

01:10:01.429 --> 01:10:03.920
You have no idea what
these people are capable of.

01:10:04.031 --> 01:10:07.432
I'm not a child! I know who I am!

01:10:07.535 --> 01:10:09.400
At least go to a real dentist!

01:10:09.503 --> 01:10:11.630
It's not safe.
I'm being watched too closely, Agnes.

01:10:11.739 --> 01:10:12.899
They haven't grabbed me yet

01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:15.942
because they want to see
how the experiment turns out!

01:10:16.043 --> 01:10:18.876
You cannot know that! Peter!

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:24.440
Stop it! No! No! No!

01:10:30.524 --> 01:10:31.684
Peter!

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:45.437
Oh, God!

01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:47.063
Jesus Christ!

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:07.792
What? What?

01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:09.522
What?

01:11:19.139 --> 01:11:20.367
Millions.

01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:56.502
Is this the White residence?

01:12:00.514 --> 01:12:04.314
I'm looking for Peter Evans.
I was told I could find him here.

01:12:06.854 --> 01:12:10.085
I have it on good authority
that Peter is staying here.

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.618
I don't mean any harm.

01:12:14.728 --> 01:12:17.196
If I could just talk to Peter...

01:12:28.008 --> 01:12:30.306
Could I speak with you for a moment?

01:12:33.514 --> 01:12:36.347
I assure you
I'm here with the best of intentions.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.684
All right. Thank you.

01:13:05.279 --> 01:13:07.213
Shut up!

01:13:07.314 --> 01:13:09.839
Settle down! Shut up!

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.884
You can't... You can't take me!

01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:14.454
I'm Phillip Sweet.
All of my credentials are in there.

01:13:14.555 --> 01:13:17.456
- As if you couldn't fake that!
- Just listen to the man!

01:13:17.558 --> 01:13:20.550
- You're in way over your head here.
- Why don't you wait outside?

01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:23.129
Give us some time alone.

01:14:01.902 --> 01:14:03.836
Bug problem?

01:14:03.937 --> 01:14:05.495
You should know.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.168
- I should? What are they?
- Aphids.

01:14:09.276 --> 01:14:10.436
"Aphids"?

01:14:10.544 --> 01:14:12.375
Look around, asshole!

01:14:14.148 --> 01:14:17.379
They're in right now.
They like to go in sometimes.

01:14:17.484 --> 01:14:20.681
- And the tin foil?
- Scrambles the signal.

01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:23.951
- You're receiving a signal?
- Transmitting.

01:14:24.058 --> 01:14:28.154
- You're transmitting a signal?
- Not me, the bugs.

01:14:28.262 --> 01:14:30.526
The bugs have a transmitter?

01:14:30.631 --> 01:14:32.997
The bugs are the transmitter.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:36.228
And the tin foil scrambles the signal?

01:14:36.336 --> 01:14:37.598
It helps.

01:14:39.406 --> 01:14:41.465
I'm sure it does.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:57.020
Peter Evans has been incarcerated
in an Army hospital for four years.

01:14:57.124 --> 01:14:58.682
I know.

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:02.990
He's been diagnosed as a delusional
paranoid with schizophrenic tendencies,

01:15:03.097 --> 01:15:07.261
although personally
I'm not a big fan of labels.

01:15:07.367 --> 01:15:11.736
His doctors believe he's potentially
dangerous to himself or even others.

01:15:11.839 --> 01:15:14.637
Aren't you his doctor?

01:15:14.742 --> 01:15:16.937
More of a consultant, really.

01:15:17.044 --> 01:15:19.171
He told me about you.

01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:23.340
He said you got a kick out of it,
like some Nazi.

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:26.146
- "Got a kick out of it."
- Your experiments.

01:15:26.253 --> 01:15:27.743
My experiments.

01:15:30.124 --> 01:15:32.319
So now he's being hunted by the Army

01:15:32.426 --> 01:15:34.121
and the CIA.

01:15:36.196 --> 01:15:39.757
And you think they'd send
a doctor to find him?

01:15:39.867 --> 01:15:41.858
I'm here on my own.

01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:44.733
- 'Cause you care about Peter so much.
- Yes, I do.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.834
- Know why he was institutionalized?
- No.

01:15:48.942 --> 01:15:52.673
No. You wouldn't.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.715
- May I have a drink?
- No, you can't.

01:16:14.701 --> 01:16:17.534
- How often do you hit that thing?
- Often as I like.

01:16:20.574 --> 01:16:23.270
- May I?
- Suit yourself.

01:16:28.081 --> 01:16:30.447
- I'd be careful.
- I'm okay.

01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:33.679
Yeah, you're also sitting
on 20 gallons of high-test.

01:16:40.494 --> 01:16:42.985
I can only imagine what this is for.

01:16:43.463 --> 01:16:45.693
I don't see a jet ski in here.

01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:03.944
Bugs are a fairly common
delusion among paranoids.

01:17:06.286 --> 01:17:09.221
Bugs, spiders, snakes.

01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:11.985
Spiders.

01:17:12.993 --> 01:17:16.360
- You haven't had any snakes, have you?
- You're the first.

01:17:17.831 --> 01:17:19.799
Have you at least entertained the idea

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.061
that the bugs are a delusion?

01:17:23.403 --> 01:17:25.894
How do I know you're not a delusion?

01:17:26.306 --> 01:17:28.001
Touché.

01:17:41.989 --> 01:17:45.186
Well, that's no delusion.

01:17:47.194 --> 01:17:49.287
Where do the bugs come from?

01:17:49.396 --> 01:17:52.627
- Peter.
- And how's that work?

01:17:52.733 --> 01:17:54.166
You injected him.

01:17:54.268 --> 01:17:56.463
I injected him. Right.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.902
- When did you first see the bugs?
- When they got here.

01:17:59.006 --> 01:18:01.031
- He saw them first?
- They're his bugs.

01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:03.268
Yes, they are.

01:18:03.377 --> 01:18:07.279
And when I take him away,
the bugs'll disappear.

01:18:11.818 --> 01:18:14.343
You want the bugs to disappear.

01:18:14.454 --> 01:18:16.354
I can handle it.

01:18:17.624 --> 01:18:19.091
We're...

01:18:19.192 --> 01:18:21.854
- We're winning the fight.
- Really?

01:18:21.962 --> 01:18:23.327
The bugs are

01:18:24.464 --> 01:18:25.453
retreating?

01:18:25.565 --> 01:18:29.001
No, but we can find the egg sacs now

01:18:29.102 --> 01:18:30.899
and cut them out of his body.

01:18:31.004 --> 01:18:34.064
You keep up that cutting,
there might not be much left of Peter.

01:18:34.174 --> 01:18:37.473
- For you or for me.
- I know what I'm doing.

01:18:53.493 --> 01:18:55.256
You're being watched.

01:19:01.668 --> 01:19:04.136
I could talk to them. They'd listen to me.

01:19:10.544 --> 01:19:12.569
Peter comes in out of the cold,

01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:17.116
first thing I'd do, I'll get him in surgery
so they can cut out those eggs.

01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:22.219
- Egg sacs.
- Egg sacs. Simple procedure,

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:25.689
under the proper conditions,
with a trained medical staff.

01:19:28.228 --> 01:19:30.389
Don't put him back in the hospital.
They'll take him away from me.

01:19:30.497 --> 01:19:33.557
No, they won't. I won't let them.

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:38.736
You can do that?

01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:42.297
I am his doctor. He's my project.

01:19:42.409 --> 01:19:44.400
He is?

01:19:46.079 --> 01:19:48.479
I don't want to see him locked up.

01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:51.378
I want to help him.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:59.354
Well, why would you
stop what you started?

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.528
We made a mistake.

01:20:04.564 --> 01:20:06.964
I made a mistake.

01:20:07.067 --> 01:20:09.126
I didn't realize...

01:20:11.004 --> 01:20:13.802
I didn't know what they were using it for.

01:20:14.674 --> 01:20:18.235
What they're doing, it's dangerous.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.271
It's wrong.

01:20:25.919 --> 01:20:27.511
Have him call me.

01:20:35.295 --> 01:20:37.661
Let me take him in.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.936
Because if you leave it in their hands,

01:20:44.037 --> 01:20:46.471
I can't vouch for Peter's chances.

01:20:50.377 --> 01:20:52.777
Why are they doing this?

01:21:01.822 --> 01:21:03.722
It's what they do.

01:21:09.296 --> 01:21:11.389
I can't trust you.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.068
Yes, you can.

01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:21.007
I can do something for you. I can help you.

01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:23.641
Your son, Lloyd.

01:21:25.045 --> 01:21:27.036
What do you know about Lloyd?

01:21:27.147 --> 01:21:28.910
I can help you find Lloyd.

01:21:29.015 --> 01:21:32.451
- You know about Lloyd? What?
- I shouldn't say anything else.

01:21:32.552 --> 01:21:35.316
No. If you know something about my son,
you have to tell me!

01:21:35.422 --> 01:21:39.017
- They're watching. If I say too much...
- Who?

01:21:39.126 --> 01:21:41.458
Oh, just tell me...

01:21:41.561 --> 01:21:43.756
Is he alive? Is he alive?

01:21:43.864 --> 01:21:46.196
Just... Is he okay?

01:21:52.539 --> 01:21:54.837
Where is he? Tell me where he is.
Just tell me where...

01:21:54.941 --> 01:21:56.806
- Please? Please?
- I have to be discreet.

01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.242
If I say too much, they might hurt him.

01:21:59.346 --> 01:22:01.507
- You don't want that, do you?
- Oh, no! No!

01:22:01.615 --> 01:22:03.412
But he's alive? Oh, my...

01:22:03.517 --> 01:22:07.715
Help me bring Peter in,
and I'll help you find Lloyd.

01:22:08.855 --> 01:22:12.214
Oh, Peter! Peter, Lloyd's alive!

01:22:12.325 --> 01:22:15.317
- Peter. Good Lord.
- He's alive! He's gonna take you in,

01:22:15.428 --> 01:22:18.727
he's gonna cut out all the little egg sacs,

01:22:18.832 --> 01:22:21.858
and he's gonna help us!

01:22:23.336 --> 01:22:24.303
Peter.

01:22:25.338 --> 01:22:27.772
- Peter, what are you doing?
- What are you?

01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:31.138
- What are you doing?
- You need to come back...

01:22:31.244 --> 01:22:33.644
From the factory. Sound card's good.
What do you run on?

01:22:33.747 --> 01:22:35.772
- You need your meds.
- New model.

01:22:35.882 --> 01:22:39.318
- We need to talk, talk to one another.
- Do you know him?

01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:43.387
- Do you know him?
- He knows me. It's all right.

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:46.323
Munitions, R and D, nice work.

01:22:46.426 --> 01:22:48.360
- What's happening?
- You believed it.

01:22:48.461 --> 01:22:50.656
No, he'll bring me... He'll bring me Lloyd!

01:22:50.764 --> 01:22:52.527
She's not part of this.

01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:55.658
He'll tell you anything
you want to hear, Agnes.

01:22:55.769 --> 01:22:58.397
- This is between you and me.
- That's how it's programmed.

01:22:58.505 --> 01:22:59.938
It's always been you and me.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.134
- I don't understand.
- I'll cut it open. I'll show you.

01:23:04.277 --> 01:23:06.074
Machine!

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.279
- Machine!
- Oh, God, Peter!

01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:10.747
Machine! Machine!

01:23:14.254 --> 01:23:17.451
He said he was gonna help me find my son!

01:23:28.802 --> 01:23:30.895
Stop it!

01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:36.108
Oh, stop it, Peter! Peter, stop it!

01:23:36.409 --> 01:23:38.741
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Touch it! Here.

01:23:38.845 --> 01:23:41.905
Feel it. Okay? This isn't real.

01:23:42.015 --> 01:23:43.312
- Real!
- See? It's not real.

01:23:43.416 --> 01:23:45.316
- Real what? I don't...
- No, no, no, no. It's synthetic.

01:23:45.418 --> 01:23:48.182
- It's not even close. See?
- I don't understand.

01:23:48.288 --> 01:23:50.119
- What are you talking about?
- No, no, no.

01:23:50.223 --> 01:23:52.555
- He said he knew where Lloyd was!
- Agnes, Agnes, listen to me.

01:23:52.659 --> 01:23:54.854
It doesn't know where Lloyd is.
It doesn't know anything.

01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:58.522
It only knows what they
program it to say, okay?

01:23:58.632 --> 01:24:01.294
No, shut up!
They can't wait for me to come outside.

01:24:01.401 --> 01:24:03.665
They've come to collect me.
The experiment is over.

01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.568
They've come to pick up their petri dish,
and they sent a machine to do it.

01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:08.573
Agnes, it is a fucking machine!

01:24:08.675 --> 01:24:10.575
You can see for yourself.
They're sending in machines.

01:24:10.677 --> 01:24:12.440
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Okay? Okay.

01:24:12.545 --> 01:24:14.376
I don't really understand.

01:24:14.481 --> 01:24:16.949
You have to explain to me
what is going on, Peter.

01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:20.884
Listen! Listen!
If you want to know what is going on...

01:24:20.987 --> 01:24:22.579
- You have to listen to me!
- I'm listening!

01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:24.088
- You have to!
- I'm listening.

01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:28.456
Because you don't know the fucking
enormity of what we're dealing with!

01:24:28.561 --> 01:24:30.529
- I'm listening.
- May the 29th, 1954,

01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:34.225
a consortium of bankers, industrialists,
CEOs and politicians

01:24:34.334 --> 01:24:36.529
held a series of meetings over three days

01:24:36.636 --> 01:24:39.161
at the Bilderberg Hotel
in Oosterbeek, Holland.

01:24:39.272 --> 01:24:42.867
They drew up a plan
for maintaining the status quo.

01:24:42.976 --> 01:24:44.443
- What's that?
- It's the way things are.

01:24:44.544 --> 01:24:46.876
It's the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:49.073
They devised a plan to manipulate

01:24:49.182 --> 01:24:51.980
technology, economics, the media,

01:24:52.085 --> 01:24:54.576
population control, world religion,

01:24:54.688 --> 01:24:56.918
to keep things the way they are.

01:24:57.023 --> 01:25:00.754
They have continued to meet once a year
every year since the original meeting.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:05.854
Look it up. Under their orders, the CIA
smuggled Nazi scientists into the States

01:25:05.965 --> 01:25:08.365
to work with the American military
and Calspan,

01:25:08.468 --> 01:25:10.663
developing an inner-epidermal
tracking microchip.

01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:12.863
- A what?
- A surveillance tool, a computer chip

01:25:12.972 --> 01:25:15.941
that has been implanted in the skin
of every human being

01:25:16.042 --> 01:25:19.739
- born on the planet since 1982.
- Oh, my God!

01:25:19.846 --> 01:25:24.681
The test group for the prototype
was the People's Temple.

01:25:24.784 --> 01:25:27.912
And when the Reverend Jim Jones
threatened to expose them,

01:25:28.021 --> 01:25:31.286
he and every member of his church
were assassinated!

01:25:31.391 --> 01:25:33.757
But it's not enough just to track people,
to spy on them.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.259
- They want control.
- Yeah.

01:25:35.362 --> 01:25:39.492
So they create the
Intelligence Manned Interface biochip,

01:25:39.599 --> 01:25:41.965
a subcutaneous transponder computer chip

01:25:42.068 --> 01:25:43.763
imprinted with living brain cells.

01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:46.862
They needed lab rats to test it,
and they found us.

01:25:46.973 --> 01:25:49.635
Me, in the Gulf, and another soldier

01:25:49.743 --> 01:25:53.907
working at Calspan at the time,
Tim McVeigh.

01:25:54.013 --> 01:25:57.107
- Oh, wait.
- They turned us into fucking zombies.

01:25:57.217 --> 01:25:58.980
Remote control assassins!

01:25:59.085 --> 01:26:01.576
And then they picked Tim up,
chucked him in a prison factory.

01:26:01.688 --> 01:26:03.952
- But I found my chip and I cut it out.
- Oh, my God!

01:26:04.057 --> 01:26:06.719
So they sent me back to the lab for further
testing and a new experiment.

01:26:06.826 --> 01:26:09.056
- You're John Doe number 2!
- No, no, no, no!

01:26:09.162 --> 01:26:10.891
That's who they want me to be.

01:26:10.997 --> 01:26:13.625
That is the flaw in the IMI biochip.

01:26:13.733 --> 01:26:14.961
They can't get to everybody.

01:26:15.068 --> 01:26:16.296
People slip through the cracks,

01:26:16.403 --> 01:26:19.861
they find the chip, they cut it out,
like me or Ted Kaczynski.

01:26:19.973 --> 01:26:24.774
They need a chip that will self-perpetuate,
that will spread like a virus,

01:26:24.878 --> 01:26:27.938
that people can pass to each other,
to everyone!

01:26:29.015 --> 01:26:31.108
They got it!

01:26:33.453 --> 01:26:35.478
Oh, you mean the bugs. They got the bugs.

01:26:35.588 --> 01:26:38.386
- A living, breathing organism.
- Oh, my God!

01:26:38.491 --> 01:26:41.551
The ultimate parasite,
implanted via a queen bug,

01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:43.754
the super-mother, who mates with a drone,

01:26:43.863 --> 01:26:46.024
lays egg sacs in the body of the host,

01:26:46.132 --> 01:26:49.966
and governs a growing army of rapidly
multiplying, brainwashing bugs.

01:26:50.069 --> 01:26:52.697
They gave those things to you,
and you gave them to me.

01:26:52.806 --> 01:26:55.434
- You gave those fucking things to me!
- Maybe.

01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:58.241
What? What? Of course you did.

01:26:58.344 --> 01:26:59.902
Agnes!

01:27:01.481 --> 01:27:04.814
I don't believe
that my presence here is accidental.

01:27:04.918 --> 01:27:07.148
What?

01:27:07.253 --> 01:27:09.949
Peter, what are you talking about?
What are you saying?

01:27:10.056 --> 01:27:13.423
I couldn't have done that. I didn't...
I didn't do that.

01:27:13.526 --> 01:27:15.323
Unless. Unless... Unless. Unless...

01:27:15.428 --> 01:27:18.886
Unless I, like, know something
that I don't know I know

01:27:18.998 --> 01:27:21.626
or I've got something I don't know I've got!

01:27:21.734 --> 01:27:23.292
- What don't you know?
- What?

01:27:23.403 --> 01:27:25.598
- I don't know. There's a lot.
- What don't you know?

01:27:25.705 --> 01:27:27.570
I don't... I... Jesus!

01:27:27.674 --> 01:27:32.077
- Think, Agnes! What don't you know?
- Lloyd! Lloyd!

01:27:32.178 --> 01:27:34.738
Lloyd.
I don't know what happened to Lloyd.

01:27:34.848 --> 01:27:37.510
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:27:37.617 --> 01:27:39.778
- You do know. Put it together.
- No. No.

01:27:39.886 --> 01:27:42.354
- The pieces will fit.
- I don't know. They don't fit.

01:27:42.455 --> 01:27:44.980
- You have to look hard enough.
- You don't think I haven't been?

01:27:45.091 --> 01:27:48.788
- They don't fit! I don't know.
- You have to look harder. You have to.

01:27:48.895 --> 01:27:51.363
I don't see it.
What are you trying to get me to see?

01:27:51.464 --> 01:27:53.898
Come on. You'll see it.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.560
- I don't know where to start.
- Start at the beginning!

01:27:56.669 --> 01:28:00.230
I took him to the grocery store,
and we were shopping.

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.604
And he was right there in the cart.
And I went back to get an onion

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:05.303
'cause I forgot the onion, and I just...
I just turned away.

01:28:05.411 --> 01:28:09.142
- And then he was just gone!
- No! "He was just gone"? No.

01:28:09.249 --> 01:28:11.649
- He couldn't get out in a few seconds.
- So he couldn't have gotten out.

01:28:11.751 --> 01:28:14.652
No, he didn't get out. He got... He got...
He got... Somebody took him.

01:28:14.754 --> 01:28:17.518
- Somebody took my boy because I was...
- Ah, "Somebody." "Somebody."

01:28:17.624 --> 01:28:20.957
Well, no, not anybody, 'cause he was smart.

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.722
He wouldn't have talked to strangers.
I told him not to talk to strangers!

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:25.730
- And he was smart!
- So then it had to be...

01:28:25.832 --> 01:28:27.993
It had to be somebody that he knew!

01:28:28.101 --> 01:28:31.867
It had to be somebody he knew,
that he wasn't scared of, like his daddy!

01:28:31.971 --> 01:28:34.462
It was his daddy! Goss took him!

01:28:34.574 --> 01:28:36.542
Goss took him,
and the police couldn't help me.

01:28:36.643 --> 01:28:38.941
And I tried so hard,
and they couldn't help me!

01:28:39.045 --> 01:28:40.444
Couldn't help you?

01:28:40.547 --> 01:28:43.482
They wouldn't help me.
They wouldn't help me,

01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:46.381
the police and the FBI, because they...

01:28:46.486 --> 01:28:48.886
Because they paid Goss to take him.

01:28:48.988 --> 01:28:52.788
They paid Goss to take him
and he gave him to them!

01:28:52.926 --> 01:28:55.156
- He gave him to them!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

01:28:55.261 --> 01:28:57.456
Get another piece. Get another piece.

01:28:57.564 --> 01:29:00.124
Oh, God, R.C. was here.

01:29:00.233 --> 01:29:02.827
R.C. was here and she left
'cause she was spying on you.

01:29:02.936 --> 01:29:05.029
- And she was spying on us.
- Think.

01:29:05.138 --> 01:29:06.730
What? No, and you brought the bugs.

01:29:06.839 --> 01:29:09.706
The bugs were under your skin in the
egg sacs, and you brought the... And R. C...

01:29:09.809 --> 01:29:11.834
- I brought the bugs.
- And R.C. brought you.

01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:15.244
R.C. brought you, then you brought
the bugs and then R.C. brought the bugs!

01:29:15.348 --> 01:29:17.578
- Yes!
- R.C. brought the bugs! The fucker!

01:29:17.684 --> 01:29:21.017
R.C. brought the bugs!
And then, and then...

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.020
And then Goss...
And then Goss got out of jail.

01:29:23.122 --> 01:29:25.249
They let him out of jail
and he wasn't supposed to get out.

01:29:25.358 --> 01:29:28.191
And they gave him this early parole,
and he came here and...

01:29:28.294 --> 01:29:31.593
- Just when I showed up.
- Yeah, yeah, because they sent him.

01:29:31.698 --> 01:29:34.258
Because they sent him.
They let him out early to send him here.

01:29:34.367 --> 01:29:36.028
He made a deal. He got an early parole.

01:29:36.135 --> 01:29:38.763
And they let him out to send here
because of the bugs, to track the bugs,

01:29:38.871 --> 01:29:40.736
to check on the bugs,
to watch their progress.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.967
And R.C. told us that
there weren't any bugs.

01:29:43.076 --> 01:29:45.044
- But R.C. brought the bugs.
- Right.

01:29:45.144 --> 01:29:47.578
They made her bring the bugs. Oh, the boy!

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.172
The boy, Lavoice's little boy,
they gave her the kid!

01:29:51.417 --> 01:29:52.816
- Fuck!
- They never would've done that.

01:29:52.919 --> 01:29:55.752
A couple of fucking queers!
They wouldn't have given them that kid!

01:29:55.855 --> 01:29:58.983
And they made her bring me
the bugs to give me,

01:29:59.092 --> 01:30:01.151
to give them the kid!

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.592
And then, and then...

01:30:03.696 --> 01:30:07.359
But, wait. No, no.
You never had bugs before you got here.

01:30:07.467 --> 01:30:10.300
They had you all that time,
they did all those things to you,

01:30:10.403 --> 01:30:14.169
and you never had no bugs until you got
here, until after you, until after we...

01:30:14.273 --> 01:30:17.174
Oh, my God! After we...

01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:20.210
After we... Oh, it's...

01:30:20.313 --> 01:30:22.042
It's "we," it's us, it's...

01:30:22.148 --> 01:30:25.709
They... They... They gave you the...
What'd they call that... The drone.

01:30:25.818 --> 01:30:29.083
They gave you the drone.
And gave me the queen.

01:30:29.188 --> 01:30:31.156
They gave me the mother!

01:30:31.257 --> 01:30:35.421
And that's when they came out. That's
when they mated, when we made them!

01:30:35.528 --> 01:30:37.826
When we... And then, and then, and then...

01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:39.830
Oh, my God, it had to be me.

01:30:39.932 --> 01:30:43.129
It had to be me from the very beginning
because they took... They took Lloyd.

01:30:43.236 --> 01:30:45.966
They took him somewhere,
they took him to this laboratory,

01:30:46.072 --> 01:30:48.040
and they...
And they cut him, and they cut him open,

01:30:48.141 --> 01:30:50.507
and the stuff matched or whatever, the DNA

01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:53.738
and the blood, it all went together,
and so they started to build...

01:30:53.846 --> 01:30:56.337
They started to build,
they started to build the queen,

01:30:56.449 --> 01:30:59.213
the mother, and they gave it to me.

01:30:59.318 --> 01:31:01.252
They gave it to me.

01:31:01.354 --> 01:31:03.549
The juice, the bug, the mother,

01:31:03.656 --> 01:31:06.750
the bug, the super-mother bug.

01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:14.728
I am the super-mother bug!

01:31:14.834 --> 01:31:19.237
I am the super-mother bug! Oh, my God!

01:31:19.338 --> 01:31:21.272
We made them!

01:31:21.374 --> 01:31:23.774
We made them! We gave birth to them!

01:31:23.876 --> 01:31:26.811
And they will never leave us. They will
never leave us because we made them.

01:31:26.913 --> 01:31:30.246
And those people... Those people are trying
to come in here to kill us

01:31:30.349 --> 01:31:32.544
because the bugs won't go out
into the world to do their work!

01:31:32.652 --> 01:31:36.782
They would never leave us! They will
never leave us! We are all they know.

01:31:36.889 --> 01:31:39.517
And they're trying
to come in here to kill us,

01:31:39.625 --> 01:31:41.923
to send the bugs back out into the world!

01:31:42.028 --> 01:31:45.486
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
do you know what we have to do?

01:31:45.598 --> 01:31:47.327
You know what we have to do?
We have to kill them.

01:31:47.433 --> 01:31:50.334
Yes, yes, yes.

01:31:51.204 --> 01:31:52.603
It's better knowing.

01:31:52.705 --> 01:31:55.230
Oh, we have to kill them.
We are responsible.

01:31:59.979 --> 01:32:02.470
What is it?

01:32:02.582 --> 01:32:05.016
- Who is it?
- Pizza Harris.

01:32:05.118 --> 01:32:08.144
- When did I order a pizza?
- You order a pizza?

01:32:08.254 --> 01:32:09.721
No.

01:32:13.559 --> 01:32:16.357
- Just leave it!
- You gotta pay me, lady.

01:32:18.631 --> 01:32:21.759
- How much is it?
- $14.74.

01:32:22.802 --> 01:32:24.929
- What's on it?
- Everything.

01:32:26.672 --> 01:32:29.266
- Everything?
- Everything.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:32.344
Everything.

01:32:32.445 --> 01:32:36.006
- You want change?
- No. Just take it.

01:32:36.115 --> 01:32:38.083
Yeah, whatever.

01:32:43.322 --> 01:32:46.883
If we don't open the door,
they'll know we know.

01:33:12.318 --> 01:33:16.015
Okay, ready? Okay, one, two...

01:33:18.324 --> 01:33:20.724
No, no. No, no. Hold it.

01:33:20.827 --> 01:33:22.419
Hold it.

01:33:34.807 --> 01:33:36.798
How does it look?

01:33:36.909 --> 01:33:38.877
I'm no expert.

01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:44.580
- Oh, I don't think that's clean!
- Vicious bastards!

01:33:46.519 --> 01:33:47.486
Aggie!

01:33:51.224 --> 01:33:54.921
Open the fucking door! Aggie?

01:33:55.027 --> 01:33:57.689
Damn it, Aggie, open this door!

01:34:01.567 --> 01:34:02.534
Aggie!

01:34:03.202 --> 01:34:05.227
Aggie, come here!

01:34:06.172 --> 01:34:07.469
Aggie!

01:34:12.879 --> 01:34:15.609
You whore! You fucking bitch!

01:34:16.716 --> 01:34:19.446
Fuck! You fucking whore!

01:34:22.822 --> 01:34:25.655
Open the fucking door!

01:34:29.228 --> 01:34:31.162
They're all coming out.

01:34:31.264 --> 01:34:34.631
- Look at the ceiling...
- They're everywhere!

01:35:23.449 --> 01:35:25.417
I am the drone.

01:35:30.489 --> 01:35:32.116
You are the queen.

01:35:33.192 --> 01:35:36.525
- Under the skin...
- Breeding ground...

01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:39.029
- Egg sac...
- Larvae pool...

01:35:39.131 --> 01:35:41.258
- Baby bug water...
- Feeding pupa...

01:35:41.367 --> 01:35:44.768
Oh, feeding baby bug.

01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:47.737
Skin and ground, breeding egg sacs...

01:36:07.426 --> 01:36:10.554
- I love you.
- I love you.
