00:48.700 --> 00:51.229
During the great depression,
which I'm old enough to remember,

00:51.330 --> 00:52.338
there was...

00:52.438 --> 00:55.507
And most of my family were
unemployed working class...

00:55.607 --> 00:57.242
There wasn't... it was bad,

00:57.342 --> 00:59.644
much worse subjectively than today.

00:59.744 --> 01:03.104
But there was an expectation
that things were going to get better.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.480
There was a real sense of hopefulness.

01:06.782 --> 01:08.181
There isn't today.

01:17.624 --> 01:21.295
Inequality is really unprecedented.

01:21.395 --> 01:23.339
If you look at total inequality,

01:23.440 --> 01:25.997
it's like the worst periods
of American history.

01:31.697 --> 01:33.797
But if you refine it more closely,

01:33.897 --> 01:37.417
the inequality comes
from the extreme wealth

01:37.518 --> 01:40.037
in a tiny sector of the population,

01:40.144 --> 01:41.676
a fraction of one percent.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.050
There were periods like
the gilded age in the '20s

01:48.150 --> 01:50.085
and the roaring '90s and so on,

01:50.185 --> 01:52.718
when a situation developed
rather similar to this.

01:53.786 --> 01:55.954
Now, this period is extreme...

01:56.156 --> 01:58.658
Because if you look
at the wealth distribution,

01:58.758 --> 02:03.393
the inequality mostly comes
from super wealth.

02:07.197 --> 02:11.232
Literally, the top 1/10th of a percent
are just super wealthy.

02:12.767 --> 02:15.804
Not only is it extremely unjust in itself...

02:16.304 --> 02:20.505
Inequality has highly negative consequences
on the society as a whole...

02:22.708 --> 02:28.379
Because the very fact of inequality has
a corrosive, harmful effect on democracy.

02:34.218 --> 02:36.721
You open by talking about
the American dream.

02:36.821 --> 02:39.254
Part of the American dream
is class mobility.

02:39.354 --> 02:42.254
you're born poor, you work hard,
you get rich.

02:42.354 --> 02:47.030
It was possible for a worker
to get a decent job, buy a home...

02:47.130 --> 02:50.063
Get a car,
have his children go to school.

02:52.199 --> 02:53.565
It's all collapsed.

03:07.846 --> 03:12.816
Imagine yourself in an outside position,
looking from Mars.

03:13.751 --> 03:15.084
What do you see?

03:40.643 --> 03:42.044
In the United States,

03:42.145 --> 03:45.079
there are professed values
like democracy.

03:51.552 --> 03:56.188
In a democracy, public opinion is going
to have some influence on policy.

04:00.826 --> 04:03.313
And then, the government
carries out actions

04:03.414 --> 04:05.431
determined by the population.

04:05.531 --> 04:07.397
That's what democracy means.

04:11.835 --> 04:15.873
It's important to understand that
privileged and powerful sectors

04:15.973 --> 04:18.333
have never liked democracy...

04:18.434 --> 04:20.711
and for very good reasons.

04:21.211 --> 04:24.981
Democracy puts power into
the hands of the general population

04:25.081 --> 04:26.613
and takes it away from them.

04:28.816 --> 04:32.818
It's kind of a principle
of concentration of wealth and power.

04:48.334 --> 04:52.272
Concentration of wealth
yields concentration of power...

04:52.372 --> 04:56.909
Particularly so as the
cost of elections skyrockets,

04:57.009 --> 05:03.015
which kind of forces the political parties
into the pockets of major corporations.

05:03.615 --> 05:08.353
And this political power
quickly translates into legislation

05:08.453 --> 05:10.989
that increases the concentration of wealth.

05:11.389 --> 05:14.825
So fiscal policy, like tax policy...

05:14.925 --> 05:16.994
Deregulation...

05:17.894 --> 05:22.332
Rules of corporate governance
and a whole variety of measures...

05:22.632 --> 05:27.670
Political measures, designed to increase
the concentration of wealth and power,

05:27.770 --> 05:30.579
which, in turn,
yields more political power

05:30.680 --> 05:31.904
to do the same thing.

05:33.707 --> 05:35.727
And that's what we've been seeing.

05:39.578 --> 05:42.646
So we have this kind of
vicious cycle in progress.

05:47.752 --> 05:54.226
You know, actually, it is so traditional
that it was described by Adam Smith in 1776.

05:54.326 --> 05:56.492
You read the famous
"Wealth of Nations."

06:00.530 --> 06:04.101
He says in England,
the principal architects of policy

06:04.201 --> 06:06.003
are the people who own the society.

06:06.103 --> 06:09.006
In his day, merchants
and manufacturers.

06:09.806 --> 06:12.366
And they make sure
that their own interests

06:12.467 --> 06:14.877
are very well cared for,

06:14.977 --> 06:19.546
however grievous the impact
on the people of England or others.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.418
Now, it's not merchants
and manufacturers,

06:24.518 --> 06:27.518
it's financial institutions
and multinational corporations.

06:28.753 --> 06:33.458
The people who Adam Smith
called the "masters of mankind,"

06:33.558 --> 06:36.079
and they're following the vile maxim,

06:36.180 --> 06:38.895
"all for ourselves and
nothing for anyone else."

06:41.831 --> 06:46.403
They're just going to pursue policies
that benefit them and harm everyone else.

06:46.803 --> 06:50.157
And in the absence of a
general popular reaction,

06:50.258 --> 06:52.806
that's pretty much what you'd expect.

07:03.617 --> 07:08.289
Right through American history,
there's been an ongoing clash...

07:08.389 --> 07:14.360
Between pressure for more freedom
and democracy coming from below,

07:14.460 --> 07:19.629
and efforts at elite control and
domination coming from above.

07:24.401 --> 07:26.521
It goes back to the founding of the country.

07:29.938 --> 07:31.841
James Madison, the main framer,

07:31.941 --> 07:34.550
who was as much of a believer
in democracy

07:34.651 --> 07:37.112
as anybody in the world in that day,

07:37.212 --> 07:38.480
nevertheless felt that

07:38.581 --> 07:41.016
the United States system
should be designed,

07:41.116 --> 07:44.786
and indeed with his initiative
was designed,

07:44.886 --> 07:48.523
so that power should be
in the hands of the wealthy...

07:48.823 --> 07:52.760
Because the wealthy were
the more responsible set of men.

07:52.860 --> 07:56.630
And, therefore, the structure
of the formal constitutional system

07:56.730 --> 07:59.499
placed most power
in the hands of the senate.

07:59.599 --> 08:02.502
Remember, the senate
was not elected in those days.

08:02.602 --> 08:04.737
It was selected from the wealthy.

08:04.837 --> 08:06.301
Men, as Madison put it,

08:06.402 --> 08:09.839
"had sympathy for property owners
and their rights."

08:12.476 --> 08:15.476
If you read the debates
at the constitutional convention...

08:16.713 --> 08:20.384
Madison said, "the major concern
of the society has to be

08:20.484 --> 08:23.785
to protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority."

08:27.656 --> 08:29.358
And he had arguments.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.927
Suppose everyone had a vote freely.

08:32.027 --> 08:35.630
He said, "well, the majority of the poor
would get together

08:35.730 --> 08:38.866
and they would organize
to take away the property of the rich."

08:38.966 --> 08:42.669
And, he said, "that would obviously
be unjust, so you can't have that."

08:42.769 --> 08:46.169
So, therefore the constitutional system
has to be set up to prevent democracy.

08:57.914 --> 09:02.853
That's of some interest that
this debate has a hoary tradition.

09:02.953 --> 09:07.722
Goes back to the first major book
on political systems, Aristotle's "politics."

09:09.858 --> 09:13.028
He says, "of all of them,
the best is democracy,"

09:13.128 --> 09:17.129
but then he points out exactly
the flaw that Madison pointed out.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.403
If Athens were a democracy
for free men,

09:23.503 --> 09:26.703
the poor would get together
and take away the property of the rich.

09:27.972 --> 09:31.543
Well, same dilemma,
they had opposite solutions.

09:31.643 --> 09:35.547
Aristotle proposed what we would
nowadays call a welfare state.

09:35.647 --> 09:37.607
He said,
"try to reduce inequality."

09:42.585 --> 09:45.388
So, same problem, opposite solutions.

09:45.488 --> 09:48.791
One is reduce inequality,
you won't have this problem.

09:48.891 --> 09:50.690
The other is reduce democracy.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.667
If you look at the history
of the United States...

09:59.767 --> 10:02.903
It's a constant struggle
between these two tendencies.

10:03.003 --> 10:08.038
A democratizing tendency that's mostly coming
from the population, pressure from below

10:08.138 --> 10:13.146
and you get this constant battle going on,
periods of regression, periods of progress.

10:13.246 --> 10:18.616
The 1960s for example, were
a period of significant democratization.

10:33.062 --> 10:37.000
Sectors of the population
that were usually passive

10:37.100 --> 10:41.869
and apathetic became organized, active,
started pressing their demands.

10:46.941 --> 10:52.811
And they became more and more involved
in decision-making, activism and so on.

10:54.079 --> 10:56.847
It just changed consciousness
in a lot of ways.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.855
Minority rights

11:03.955 --> 11:07.925
If democracy means freedom,
why aren't our people free?

11:08.025 --> 11:11.228
If democracy means justice,
why don't we have justice?

11:11.328 --> 11:15.597
If democracy means equality,
why don't we have equality?

11:15.697 --> 11:17.273
Women's rights

11:17.373 --> 11:20.837
This inhuman system
of exploitation will change,

11:20.937 --> 11:24.874
but only if we force it to change,
and force it together.

11:24.974 --> 11:26.609
Concern for the environment.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.911
A unique day in American history is ending,

11:29.011 --> 11:32.814
a day set aside for a nationwide
outpouring of mankind

11:32.915 --> 11:34.680
seeking its own survival.

11:35.073 --> 11:36.473
Opposition to aggression

11:36.573 --> 11:39.787
I say to those who criticize us
for the militancy of our dissent

11:39.887 --> 11:42.122
that if they are serious
about law and order,

11:42.222 --> 11:44.891
they should first provide it
for the Vietnamese people,

11:44.991 --> 11:48.094
for our own black people
and for our own poor people.

11:48.194 --> 11:49.795
Concern for other people.

11:49.895 --> 11:51.864
One day we must ask the question,

11:51.964 --> 11:54.600
"why are there 40 million
poor people in America?"

11:54.700 --> 11:57.603
When you begin to ask that question,

11:57.703 --> 12:00.606
you're raising a question
about the economic system,

12:00.706 --> 12:02.841
about a broader distribution of wealth,

12:02.941 --> 12:07.378
the question of restructuring
the whole of American society.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.398
These are all civilizing effects...

12:12.714 --> 12:14.147
And that caused great fear.

12:29.796 --> 12:34.668
I hadn't anticipated the power...

12:34.768 --> 12:38.371
I should've, but I didn't anticipate
the power of the reaction

12:38.471 --> 12:40.840
to these civilizing effects of the '60s.

12:40.940 --> 12:46.242
I did not anticipate the strength
of the reaction to it.

12:49.813 --> 12:51.113
The backlash.

12:59.888 --> 13:04.093
There has been an enormous
concentrated, coordinated...

13:04.193 --> 13:06.829
Business offensive beginning in the '70s

13:06.929 --> 13:10.432
to try to beat back the egalitarian efforts

13:10.532 --> 13:12.765
that went right through the Nixon years.

13:13.037 --> 13:14.217
You see it in many respects

13:14.317 --> 13:20.105
Over on the right, you see it in things
like the famous Powell memorandum...

13:22.241 --> 13:25.044
Sent to the chamber of commerce,
the major business lobby,

13:25.144 --> 13:28.047
by later supreme court justice Powell...

13:28.147 --> 13:32.215
Warning them that business
is losing control over the society...

13:35.252 --> 13:38.322
And something has to be done
to counter these forces.

13:38.422 --> 13:40.924
Of course, he puts it
in terms of defense,

13:41.024 --> 13:43.457
"defending ourselves
against an outside power."

13:49.363 --> 13:51.941
But if you look at it,
it's a call for business to use

13:52.042 --> 13:54.068
its control over resources

13:54.168 --> 13:58.236
to carry out a major offensive
to beat back this democratizing wave.

14:08.346 --> 14:12.050
Over on the liberal side,
there's something exactly similar.

14:12.150 --> 14:17.822
The first major report of
the trilateral commission

14:17.922 --> 14:21.456
is concerned with this.
It's called "the crisis of democracy."

14:23.358 --> 14:26.128
Trilateral commission
is liberal internationalists...

14:26.228 --> 14:29.231
Their flavor is indicated
by the fact that

14:29.331 --> 14:31.612
they pretty much staffed
the Carter administration.

14:35.903 --> 14:40.408
They were also appalled by
the democratizing tendencies of the '60s,

14:40.508 --> 14:43.811
and thought we have to react to it.

14:43.911 --> 14:47.579
They were concerned that there was
an "excess of democracy" developing.

14:51.150 --> 14:56.222
Previously passive and obedient
parts of the population,

14:56.322 --> 14:58.390
what are sometimes called,
"the special interests,"

14:58.490 --> 15:02.394
were beginning to organize and
try to enter the political arena,

15:02.494 --> 15:06.297
and they said, "that imposes
too much pressure on the state.

15:06.397 --> 15:08.766
It can't deal with all these pressures."

15:08.866 --> 15:14.068
So, therefore, they have to return
to passivity and become depoliticized.

15:15.938 --> 15:18.807
They were particularly concerned with
what was happening to young people.

15:18.907 --> 15:20.875
"The young people are getting
too free and independent."

15:20.975 --> 15:23.010
None of us will begin any violence.

15:23.110 --> 15:27.214
If there's any violence,
it will be because of the police.

15:27.314 --> 15:31.218
The way they put it, there's failure
on the part of the schools,

15:31.318 --> 15:33.553
the universities, the churches...

15:33.653 --> 15:37.857
The institutions responsible
for the "indoctrination of the young."

15:37.957 --> 15:39.389
Their phrase, not mine.

15:44.495 --> 15:47.797
If you look at their study,
there's one interest they never mention...

15:47.897 --> 15:49.353
Private business

15:49.453 --> 15:50.577
And that makes sense,

15:50.678 --> 15:53.104
they're not special interest,
they're the national interest,

15:53.204 --> 15:54.352
kind of by definition.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.473
So they're okay.

15:55.573 --> 15:59.977
They're allowed to, you know,
have lobbyists, buy campaigns,

16:00.077 --> 16:02.980
staff the executive,
make decisions, that's fine.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.550
But it's the rest, the special interests,
the general population,

16:06.650 --> 16:08.149
who have to be subdued.

16:15.656 --> 16:17.125
Well, that's the spectrum.

16:17.225 --> 16:21.129
It's the kind of ideological
level of the backlash.

16:21.229 --> 16:25.066
But the major backlash,
which was in parallel to this...

16:25.166 --> 16:27.466
Was just redesigning the economy.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.374
Since the 1970s, there's been a

16:44.475 --> 16:48.487
concerted effort on the part
of the masters of mankind,

16:48.587 --> 16:50.455
the owners of the society,

16:50.555 --> 16:54.125
to shift the economy
in two crucial respects.

16:54.225 --> 16:59.529
One, to increase the role
of financial institutions,

16:59.629 --> 17:03.299
banks, investment firms, so on...

17:03.399 --> 17:05.467
Insurance companies.

17:05.567 --> 17:09.637
By 2007, right before the latest crash,

17:09.737 --> 17:13.438
they had literally 40% of corporate profits...

17:16.375 --> 17:18.275
Far beyond anything in the past.

17:26.683 --> 17:30.321
Back in the 1950s,
as for many years before,

17:30.421 --> 17:34.124
the United States economy
was based largely on production.

17:34.224 --> 17:38.759
The United States was the great
manufacturing center of the world.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.604
Financial institutions used to be
a relatively small part of the economy

17:49.704 --> 17:54.574
and their task was to distribute
unused assets like,

17:54.674 --> 17:58.277
say, bank savings to productive activity.

17:58.377 --> 18:01.146
The bank always has on hand
a reserve of money

18:01.246 --> 18:03.648
received from the stockholders
and depositors.

18:03.748 --> 18:06.183
On the basis of these cash reserves,

18:06.283 --> 18:07.919
a bank can create credit.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.321
So besides providing a safe place
for depositing money,

18:11.421 --> 18:13.049
a bank serves a community

18:13.150 --> 18:16.359
by making additional credit
available for many purposes.

18:16.459 --> 18:19.995
For a manufacturer to meet his payroll
during slack selling periods,

18:20.095 --> 18:22.998
or a merchant to enlarge
and remodel his store,

18:23.098 --> 18:27.235
and for many other good reasons
why people are always needing more credit

18:27.335 --> 18:29.670
than they have immediately available.

18:29.770 --> 18:32.531
That's a contribution to the economy.

18:33.272 --> 18:35.241
Regulatory system was established.

18:35.341 --> 18:37.443
Banks were regulated.

18:37.543 --> 18:40.179
Commercial and investment banks
were separated,

18:40.279 --> 18:46.484
cut back their risky investment practices
that could harm private people.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.450
There had been, remember,
no financial crashes

18:49.551 --> 18:51.589
during the period of regulation.

18:51.689 --> 18:54.423
By the 1970s, that changed.

19:03.632 --> 19:08.237
You started getting that huge increase
in the flows of speculative capital,

19:08.337 --> 19:10.539
just astronomically increase,

19:10.639 --> 19:13.141
enormous changes in the financial sector

19:13.241 --> 19:17.378
from traditional banks
to risky investments,

19:17.478 --> 19:22.282
complex financial instruments,
money manipulations and so on.

19:22.382 --> 19:27.851
Increasingly, the business of the country
isn't production, at least not here.

19:29.587 --> 19:32.757
The primary business here is business.

19:32.857 --> 19:36.060
You can even see it
in the choice of directors.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.580
So, a director of a major
American corporation

19:39.681 --> 19:41.432
back in the '50s and '60s

19:41.532 --> 19:43.556
was very likely to be an engineer,

19:43.657 --> 19:46.370
somebody who graduated
from a place like MIT,

19:46.470 --> 19:48.438
maybe industrial management.

19:48.538 --> 19:52.675
More recently, the directorship
and the top managerial positions

19:52.775 --> 19:54.777
are people who came out
of business schools,

19:54.877 --> 19:58.378
learned the financial trickery
of various kinds, and so on.

20:00.214 --> 20:04.285
By the 1970s, say General Electric
could make more profit

20:04.385 --> 20:05.833
playing games with money

20:05.934 --> 20:08.987
than you could by producing
in the United States.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.761
You have to remember
that General Electric

20:14.861 --> 20:18.331
is substantially
a financial institution today.

20:18.431 --> 20:20.112
It makes half its profits

20:20.213 --> 20:23.536
just by moving money around
in complicated ways.

20:23.636 --> 20:26.190
And it's very unclear
that they're doing anything

20:26.291 --> 20:28.507
that's of value to the economy.

20:28.807 --> 20:30.636
So that's one phenomenon,

20:30.737 --> 20:32.975
that's called financialization
of the economy.

20:35.779 --> 20:38.839
Going along with that
is the off-shoring of production.

20:56.365 --> 20:59.168
The trade system was reconstructed

20:59.268 --> 21:02.771
with a very explicit design of putting

21:02.871 --> 21:05.313
working people in competition
with one another

21:05.414 --> 21:06.772
all over the world.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.946
And what it's led to

21:10.047 --> 21:13.513
is a reduction in the share of income

21:13.613 --> 21:15.683
on the part of working people.

21:16.883 --> 21:18.971
It's been particularly striking
in the United States,

21:19.072 --> 21:20.419
but it's happening worldwide.

21:20.519 --> 21:23.355
It means that an American worker
is in competition

21:23.455 --> 21:26.521
with the super-exploited worker in China.

21:29.358 --> 21:32.729
Meanwhile, highly paid
professionals are protected.

21:32.829 --> 21:36.057
They're not placed in competition
with the rest of the world.

21:36.158 --> 21:37.400
Far from it.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.469
And, of course,
the capital is free to move.

21:40.569 --> 21:43.247
Workers aren't free to move,
labor can't move,

21:43.348 --> 21:44.873
but capital can.

21:44.973 --> 21:48.643
Well, again, going back
to the classics like Adam Smith,

21:48.743 --> 21:52.213
as he pointed out,
free circulation of labor

21:52.313 --> 21:55.783
is the foundation of any
free trade system,

21:55.883 --> 21:58.652
but workers are pretty much stuck.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.521
The wealthy and the privileged
are protected,

22:01.621 --> 22:03.689
so you get obvious consequences.

22:03.789 --> 22:06.288
And they're recognized
and, in fact, praised.

22:09.659 --> 22:12.760
Policy is designed to increase insecurity.

22:13.895 --> 22:17.232
Alan Greenspan.
When he testified to congress,

22:17.332 --> 22:21.369
he explained his success
in running the economy

22:21.469 --> 22:26.640
as based on what he called,
"greater worker insecurity."

22:26.740 --> 22:29.599
"Atypical restraint on
compensation increases

22:29.700 --> 22:31.911
has been evident for a few years now,

22:32.011 --> 22:35.714
but as I outlined in some detail
in testimony last month,

22:35.914 --> 22:39.784
I believe that job insecurity
has played the dominant role."

22:39.884 --> 22:44.321
Keep workers insecure,
they're going to be under control.

22:44.421 --> 22:48.491
They are not going to ask for,
say, decent wages...

22:48.591 --> 22:50.793
Or decent working conditions...

22:50.893 --> 22:55.531
Or the opportunity of free
association, meaning unionize.

22:55.631 --> 22:58.422
Now, for the masters of mankind, that's fine.

22:58.523 --> 23:00.402
They make their profits.

23:00.502 --> 23:03.135
But for the population, it's devastating.

23:05.004 --> 23:09.042
Well, these two processes,
financialization and off-shoring

23:09.142 --> 23:13.379
are part of what lead
to the vicious cycle

23:13.479 --> 23:16.746
of concentration of wealth
and concentration of power.

23:25.655 --> 23:29.359
I'm Noam Chomsky
and I'm on the faculty at MIT,

23:29.459 --> 23:32.462
and I've been getting more
and more heavily involved in

23:32.562 --> 23:34.862
anti-war activities for the last few years.

23:41.602 --> 23:45.006
"Noam Chomsky has made
two international reputations.

23:45.106 --> 23:50.011
The widest is as one of the national leaders
of American resistance to the Vietnam war.

23:50.111 --> 23:52.813
The deepest is as a professor of linguistics,

23:52.913 --> 23:57.181
who, before he was 40 years old,
had transformed the nature of his subject."

23:59.784 --> 24:02.421
"You are identified with the new left,
whatever that is.

24:02.521 --> 24:05.487
You certainly have been an activist
as well as a writer."

24:08.190 --> 24:10.793
"Professor Noam Chomsky...

24:10.893 --> 24:16.898
is listed in anybody's catalog as among
the half-dozen top heroes of the new left.

24:16.998 --> 24:21.335
The standing he achieved
by adopting over the past two or three years

24:21.435 --> 24:23.704
a series of adamant positions

24:23.804 --> 24:29.374
rejecting at least American foreign policy,
at most America itself."

24:36.548 --> 24:40.620
Actually this notion "anti-American"
is quite an interesting one.

24:41.020 --> 24:43.656
It's actually a totalitarian notion.

24:43.756 --> 24:46.458
It isn't used in free societies.

24:46.558 --> 24:51.896
So, if someone in, say, Italy
is criticizing Berlusconi

24:51.996 --> 24:55.399
or the corruption of the Italian state
and so on,

24:55.500 --> 24:57.601
they're not called anti-Italian.

24:57.701 --> 25:01.771
In fact, if they were called anti-Italian,
people would collapse in laughter

25:01.871 --> 25:04.404
in the streets of Rome or Milan.

25:05.539 --> 25:08.576
In totalitarian states the notion's used,

25:08.676 --> 25:13.380
so in the old Soviet Union
dissidents were called anti-Soviet.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.548
That was the worst condemnation.

25:15.648 --> 25:21.151
In the Brazilian military dictatorship,
they were called anti-Brazilian.

25:23.187 --> 25:26.091
Now, it's true that in just
about every society,

25:26.191 --> 25:29.828
the critics are maligned or mistreated...

25:29.928 --> 25:33.531
Different ways depending on
the nature of the society.

25:33.631 --> 25:37.665
Like in the Soviet union,
say Vaclav Havel would be imprisoned.

25:39.167 --> 25:43.005
In a U.S. dependency like El Salvador,
at the same time,

25:43.105 --> 25:45.714
his counterparts would have
their brains blown out

25:45.815 --> 25:49.043
by U.S.-run state terrorist forces.

25:49.143 --> 25:53.179
In other societies, they're just
condemned or vilified and so on.

25:53.279 --> 25:54.997
In the United States,

25:55.098 --> 25:58.517
one of the terms of abuse
is "anti-American."

25:58.617 --> 26:01.119
There's a couple of others,
like, you know, "Marxist."

26:01.219 --> 26:03.789
There's an array of terms of abuse.

26:04.589 --> 26:07.592
But in the United States,
you have a very high degree of freedom.

26:07.692 --> 26:11.195
So, if you're vilified by some commissars,
then who cares?

26:11.295 --> 26:13.530
You go on,
you do your work anyway.

26:13.630 --> 26:17.759
These concepts only arise
in a culture where,

26:17.860 --> 26:22.106
if you criticize state power,
and by state, I mean...

26:22.705 --> 26:26.175
more generally not just government
but state corporate power,

26:26.275 --> 26:28.499
if you criticize concentrated power,

26:28.600 --> 26:31.111
you're against the society,
you are against the people.

26:31.211 --> 26:34.782
That's quite striking,
that it's used in the United States.

26:34.882 --> 26:38.152
In fact, as far as I know,
it's the only democratic society

26:38.252 --> 26:41.021
where the concept isn't just ridiculed.

26:41.121 --> 26:45.163
That's a sign of
elements of the elite culture,

26:45.264 --> 26:48.092
which are quite ugly.

27:29.233 --> 27:32.219
The American dream,
like many ideals,

27:32.320 --> 27:35.205
was partly symbolic, but partly real.

27:35.305 --> 27:41.143
So in the 1950s and 60s, say,
there was the biggest growth period

27:41.243 --> 27:44.243
in American economic history.

27:47.347 --> 27:48.880
The golden age.

27:52.651 --> 27:55.155
It was pretty egalitarian growth,

27:55.255 --> 27:57.691
so the lowest fifth of the population

27:57.792 --> 28:00.790
was improving about as much
as the upper fifth.

28:02.325 --> 28:04.728
And there were some
welfare state measures,

28:04.828 --> 28:08.598
which improved life
for much of the population.

28:08.698 --> 28:13.169
It was, for example, possible
for a black worker

28:13.269 --> 28:16.305
to get a decent job in an auto plant,

28:16.805 --> 28:21.575
buy a home, get a car,
have his children go to school and so on.

28:21.675 --> 28:23.407
And the same across the board.

28:26.678 --> 28:31.317
When the U.S. was primarily
a manufacturing center,

28:31.417 --> 28:36.155
it had to be concerned
with its own consumers... here.

28:36.255 --> 28:41.070
Famously, Henry Ford raised
the salary of his workers

28:41.171 --> 28:43.259
so they'd be able to buy cars.

28:46.196 --> 28:50.701
When you're moving it to
an international "plutonomy,"

28:50.801 --> 28:52.869
as the banks like to call it...

28:52.969 --> 28:56.202
The small percentage
of the world's population

28:56.303 --> 28:58.841
that's gathering increasing wealth...

28:59.041 --> 29:02.778
What happens to American consumers
is much less a concern,

29:02.878 --> 29:05.880
because most of them aren't going
to be consuming your products anyway,

29:05.980 --> 29:08.082
at least not on a major basis.

29:08.182 --> 29:11.051
Your goals are,
profit in the next quarter,

29:11.151 --> 29:14.688
even if it's based on financial manipulations...

29:15.288 --> 29:16.989
High salary, high bonuses,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.324
produce overseas if you have to,

29:19.424 --> 29:24.795
and produce for the wealthy classes here
and their counterparts abroad.

29:24.895 --> 29:26.129
What about the rest?

29:26.229 --> 29:29.098
Well, there's a term coming
into use for them, too.

29:29.198 --> 29:31.867
They're called the "precariat"...

29:31.967 --> 29:34.369
Precarious proletariat...

29:34.469 --> 29:38.804
The working people of the world
who live increasingly precarious lives.

29:41.007 --> 29:43.808
And it's related to the attitude
toward the country altogether.

29:48.980 --> 29:53.085
During the period of great
growth of the economy...

29:53.185 --> 29:55.754
The '50s and the '60s,
but in fact, earlier...

29:55.854 --> 29:59.758
Taxes on the wealthy were far higher.

29:59.858 --> 30:02.260
Corporate taxes were much higher,

30:02.360 --> 30:04.829
taxes on dividends were much higher...

30:04.929 --> 30:07.698
Simply taxes on wealth were much higher.

30:07.798 --> 30:10.634
The tax system has been redesigned,

30:10.734 --> 30:16.006
so that the taxes that are paid
by the very wealthy are reduced

30:16.106 --> 30:20.741
and, correspondingly, the tax burden
on the rest of the population's increased.

30:34.121 --> 30:37.725
Now the shift is towards trying to keep taxes

30:37.825 --> 30:40.227
just on wages and on consumption...

30:40.327 --> 30:44.495
Which everyone has to do, not, say,
on dividends, which only go to the rich.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.367
The numbers are pretty striking.

30:59.176 --> 31:02.313
Now, there's a pretext...
Of course, there's always a pretext.

31:02.413 --> 31:04.062
The pretext in this case is,

31:04.163 --> 31:07.184
well, that increases investment
and increases jobs,

31:07.284 --> 31:09.286
but there isn't any evidence for that.

31:09.386 --> 31:10.838
If you want to increase investment,

31:10.939 --> 31:12.655
give money to the poor
and the working people.

31:12.755 --> 31:15.090
They have to keep alive,
so they spend their incomes.

31:15.190 --> 31:18.157
That stimulates productions,
stimulates investment,

31:18.258 --> 31:20.192
leads to job growth and so on.

31:22.962 --> 31:26.433
If you're an ideologist for the masters,
you have a different line.

31:26.533 --> 31:28.802
And in fact, right now,
it's almost absurd.

31:28.902 --> 31:32.973
Corporations have money
coming out of their pockets.

31:33.473 --> 31:36.259
So, in fact, General Electric,
are paying zero taxes,

31:36.360 --> 31:37.910
and they have enormous profits.

31:38.010 --> 31:42.214
Let's them take the profit somewhere else,
or defer it, but not pay taxes,

31:42.314 --> 31:43.646
and this is common.

31:46.950 --> 31:51.255
The major American corporations
shifted the burden of sustaining the society

31:51.355 --> 31:53.355
onto the rest of the population.

32:16.912 --> 32:18.981
Solidarity is quite dangerous.

32:19.081 --> 32:22.351
From the point of view of the masters,
you're only supposed to care about yourself,

32:22.451 --> 32:24.186
not about other people.

32:24.286 --> 32:29.491
This is quite different from the people
they claim are their heroes like Adam Smith,

32:29.591 --> 32:34.128
who based his whole approach to the economy
on the principle that sympathy

32:34.228 --> 32:36.629
is a fundamental human trait.

32:36.730 --> 32:39.133
But that has to be driven out
of people's heads.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.774
You've got to be for yourself,

32:40.875 --> 32:43.837
follow the vile maxim,
"don't care about others,"

32:43.937 --> 32:46.306
which is okay for the rich and powerful,

32:46.406 --> 32:49.373
but is devastating for everyone else.

32:52.143 --> 32:55.438
It's taken a lot of effort to try to drive

32:55.539 --> 32:59.582
these basic human emotions
out of people's heads.

33:02.252 --> 33:05.956
And we see it today in policy formation.

33:06.056 --> 33:08.856
For example,
in the attack on social security.

33:11.159 --> 33:14.830
Social security is based on a principle.

33:14.930 --> 33:17.632
It's based on a principle of solidarity.

33:17.932 --> 33:20.331
Solidarity, caring for others.

33:22.967 --> 33:27.038
Social security means,
"I pay payroll taxes...

33:27.138 --> 33:32.210
So that the widow across town
can get something to live on."

33:32.610 --> 33:35.443
For much of the population,
that's what they survive on.

33:36.478 --> 33:38.481
It's of no use to the very rich,

33:38.581 --> 33:41.781
so therefore, there's
a concerted attempt to destroy it.

33:44.117 --> 33:46.120
One of the ways is defunding it.

33:46.220 --> 33:49.257
You want to destroy some system?
First defund it.

33:49.957 --> 33:51.028
Then, it won't work.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.093
People will be angry.
They'll want something else.

33:53.193 --> 33:57.861
It's a standard technique
for privatizing some system.

34:01.265 --> 34:04.235
We see it in the attack
on public schools.

34:04.335 --> 34:08.839
Public schools are based
on the principle of solidarity.

34:09.239 --> 34:12.141
I no longer have children in school.
They're grown up...

34:12.242 --> 34:14.844
But the principle of solidarity says,

34:14.944 --> 34:20.081
"I happily pay taxes so that
the kid across the street can go to school."

34:20.181 --> 34:23.250
Now, that's normal human emotion.

34:23.350 --> 34:25.252
You have to drive that
out of people's heads.

34:25.351 --> 34:27.402
"I don't have kids in school.

34:27.504 --> 34:31.088
Why should I pay taxes?
Privatize it," so on.

34:34.292 --> 34:36.248
The public education system,

34:36.349 --> 34:39.297
all the way from kindergarten
to higher education,

34:39.398 --> 34:41.286
is under severe attack.

34:41.388 --> 34:44.733
That's one of the jewels
of American society.

34:54.409 --> 34:57.012
You go back to the golden age again...

34:57.112 --> 34:59.581
The great growth period
in the '50s and '60s.

34:59.681 --> 35:03.551
A lot of that is based
on free public education.

35:03.651 --> 35:07.588
One of the results of the second world war
was the GI bill of rights,

35:07.988 --> 35:09.848
which enabled veterans,

35:09.949 --> 35:12.792
and remember, that's a large part
of the population then,

35:12.892 --> 35:13.905
to go to college.

35:14.006 --> 35:15.494
They wouldn't have been able to, otherwise.

35:15.594 --> 35:17.229
They essentially got free education.

35:17.329 --> 35:19.564
"Where a community, state or nation...

35:19.664 --> 35:24.769
courageously invests a substantial share
of its resources in education,

35:24.869 --> 35:26.971
the investment invariably returned

35:27.072 --> 35:30.007
in better business and
a higher standard of living."

35:30.107 --> 35:35.176
U.S. was way in the lead in developing
extensive mass public education at every level.

35:37.212 --> 35:40.249
By now, in more than half the states,
most of the funding

35:40.349 --> 35:43.485
for the colleges comes from tuition,
not from the state.

35:43.585 --> 35:45.587
That's a radical change,

35:45.687 --> 35:48.256
and that's a terrible burden on students.

35:48.356 --> 35:50.324
It means that students,

35:50.425 --> 35:52.760
if they don't come from
very wealthy families,

35:52.860 --> 35:55.262
they're going to leave college
with big debts.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.731
And if you have a big debt,
you're trapped.

35:57.831 --> 36:01.534
I mean, maybe you wanted to become
a public interest lawyer,

36:01.634 --> 36:03.969
but you're going to have
to go into a corporate law firm

36:04.069 --> 36:05.536
to pay off those debts,

36:05.637 --> 36:07.138
and by the time
you're part of the culture,

36:07.238 --> 36:09.140
you know you're not going
to get out of it again.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.373
And that's true across the board.

36:14.577 --> 36:18.348
In the 1950s, it was a much
poorer society than it is today,

36:18.448 --> 36:24.487
but, nevertheless, could easily handle,
essentially free, mass higher education.

36:24.687 --> 36:29.422
Today, a much richer society claims
it doesn't have the resources for it.

36:31.358 --> 36:34.395
That's just what's going on
right before our eyes.

36:34.495 --> 36:39.432
That's the general attack
on principles that,

36:39.532 --> 36:42.668
I mean, not only are they humane,
they are the basis

36:42.768 --> 36:47.737
of the prosperity
and health of this society.

37:15.598 --> 37:18.068
If you look over the history of regulation,

37:18.168 --> 37:23.072
say, railroad regulation,
financial regulation and so on,

37:23.172 --> 37:25.874
you find that quite commonly

37:25.974 --> 37:32.446
it's either initiated by
the economic concentrations...

37:32.546 --> 37:35.783
that are being regulated,
or it's supported by them.

37:35.883 --> 37:39.052
And the reason is because
they know that,

37:39.152 --> 37:42.220
sooner or later, they can
take over the regulators.

37:46.158 --> 37:49.229
And it ends up with what's called
"regulatory capture."

37:50.229 --> 37:53.730
The business being regulated
is in fact running the regulators.

38:02.205 --> 38:06.642
Bank lobbyists are actually writing
the laws of financial regulation,

38:06.742 --> 38:08.777
it gets to that extreme.

38:08.877 --> 38:11.646
That's been happening
through history and, again,

38:11.746 --> 38:13.556
it's a pretty natural tendency

38:13.657 --> 38:16.314
when you just look
at the distribution of power.

38:20.619 --> 38:25.858
One of the things that expanded
enormously in the 1970s is lobbying,

38:25.958 --> 38:30.697
as the business world moved sharply
to try to control legislation.

38:31.797 --> 38:36.768
The business world was pretty upset
by the advances in public welfare in the '60s,

38:36.868 --> 38:39.270
in particular by Richard Nixon.

38:39.370 --> 38:42.940
It's not too well understood,
but he was the last New Deal president,

38:43.040 --> 38:45.576
and they regarded that
as class treachery.

38:46.476 --> 38:51.047
In Nixon's administration,
you get the consumer safety legislation,

38:51.347 --> 38:54.383
safety and health regulations
in the workplace,

38:54.683 --> 38:57.883
the EPA, the environmental
protection agency.

38:58.885 --> 39:00.921
Business didn't like it, of course.

39:01.021 --> 39:03.823
They didn't like the high taxes.
They didn't like the regulation.

39:03.923 --> 39:07.260
And they began a coordinated effort
to try to overcome it.

39:07.860 --> 39:10.013
Lobbying sharply increased.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.462
Deregulation began with a real ferocity.

39:15.932 --> 39:18.669
There were no financial crashes
in the '50s and the '60s,

39:18.769 --> 39:23.304
because the regulatory apparatus
of the New Deal was still in place.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.141
As it began to be dismantled

39:29.242 --> 39:31.780
under business pressure
and political pressure,

39:32.280 --> 39:34.814
you get more and more crashes.

39:43.890 --> 39:46.091
And it goes on right through the years.

39:47.460 --> 39:49.964
'70s it starts to begin.

39:50.564 --> 39:52.299
'80s really takes off.

39:52.399 --> 39:53.953
Congress was asked to approve

39:54.054 --> 39:56.135
federal loan guarantees
to the auto company

39:56.235 --> 39:58.670
of up to one and one half billion dollars.

39:58.770 --> 40:00.672
Now, all of this is quite safe

40:00.772 --> 40:03.475
as long as you know the government's
going to come to your rescue.

40:03.875 --> 40:07.245
So, take say, Reagan.
Instead of letting them pay the cost,

40:07.345 --> 40:10.548
Reagan bailed out the banks
like Continental Illinois,

40:10.648 --> 40:13.817
the biggest bailout
of American history at the time.

40:13.917 --> 40:17.453
Actually, he ended his term
with a huge financial crisis,

40:17.553 --> 40:18.696
the savings-and-loan crisis,

40:18.797 --> 40:20.655
and the government moved in
and bailed it out.

40:20.755 --> 40:22.355
"President Bush today signed

40:22.456 --> 40:25.795
the 300 billion-dollar
savings-and-loan bailout bill."

40:25.895 --> 40:29.399
In 1999, regulation was dismantled

40:29.499 --> 40:33.299
to separate commercial banks
from investment banks.

40:35.001 --> 40:37.905
Then comes the Bush and Obama bailout.

40:38.005 --> 40:40.674
"Bear Stearns is running
to the feds to stay afloat..."

40:40.774 --> 40:44.577
"President Bush today defended
the decision to bail out Citigroup..."

40:44.677 --> 40:49.348
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have asked
for a total of three billion dollars more...

40:49.448 --> 40:51.257
This bailout could get much bigger,

40:51.358 --> 40:54.157
signaling deepening troubles
for the U.S. economy."

40:57.888 --> 40:59.788
And they're building up the next one.

41:14.303 --> 41:20.375
Each time, the taxpayer is called on
to bail out those who created the crisis,

41:20.475 --> 41:24.313
increasingly the major financial institutions.

41:24.813 --> 41:27.048
In a capitalist economy,
you wouldn't do that.

41:27.148 --> 41:28.629
In a capitalist system,

41:28.730 --> 41:32.686
that would wipe out the investors
who made risky investments.

41:32.786 --> 41:35.989
But the rich and powerful,
they don't want a capitalist system.

41:36.089 --> 41:38.891
They want to be able to run
to the nanny state

41:38.991 --> 41:41.993
as soon as they're in trouble,
and get bailed out by the taxpayer.

41:42.093 --> 41:44.193
That's called "too big to fail."

41:45.695 --> 41:47.931
I mean, there are
Nobel laureates in economics

41:48.031 --> 41:51.234
who significantly disagree
with the course that we're following.

41:51.334 --> 41:54.370
People like Joe Stiglitz,
Paul Krugman and others,

41:54.470 --> 41:57.639
and none of them
were even approached.

41:57.739 --> 42:01.009
The people picked to fix the crisis
were those who created it,

42:01.109 --> 42:04.579
the Robert Rubin crowd,
the Goldman Sachs crowd.

42:04.679 --> 42:08.683
They created the crisis...
Are now more powerful than before.

42:09.083 --> 42:10.718
Is that accident?

42:10.818 --> 42:15.556
Well, not when you pick those people
to create an economic plan.

42:15.656 --> 42:17.716
I mean, what do you expect to happen?

42:21.960 --> 42:25.664
Meanwhile, for the poor,
let market principles prevail.

42:25.764 --> 42:27.866
Don't expect any help
from the government.

42:27.966 --> 42:30.702
The government's the problem,
not the solution, and so on.

42:30.802 --> 42:33.104
That's, essentially, neo-liberalism.

42:33.204 --> 42:38.842
It has this dual character
which goes right back in economic history.

42:38.942 --> 42:41.010
One set of rules for the rich.

42:41.110 --> 42:43.170
Opposite set of rules for the poor.

42:45.779 --> 42:47.815
Nothing surprising about this.

42:47.915 --> 42:50.117
It's exactly the dynamics you expect.

42:50.217 --> 42:52.817
If the population allows it to proceed,

42:52.961 --> 42:54.697
it's just going to go on and on like this

42:54.797 --> 42:56.362
until the next crash,

42:56.463 --> 43:00.493
which is so much expected
that credit agencies,

43:00.593 --> 43:03.462
which kind of evaluate the status of firms,

43:03.562 --> 43:06.531
are now counting into their calculations

43:06.631 --> 43:11.802
the taxpayer bailout that they expect
to come after the next crash.

43:11.902 --> 43:15.380
Which means that the beneficiaries
of these credit ratings,

43:15.481 --> 43:16.973
like the big banks,

43:17.073 --> 43:19.096
they can borrow money more cheaply,

43:19.197 --> 43:21.544
they can push out smaller competitors,

43:21.644 --> 43:23.546
and you get more and more concentration.

43:23.646 --> 43:25.714
Everywhere you look,
policies are designed this way,

43:25.814 --> 43:29.584
which should come as absolutely
no surprise to anyone.

43:29.684 --> 43:33.472
That's what happens
when you put power into the hands

43:33.573 --> 43:36.156
of a narrow sector of wealth,

43:36.256 --> 43:39.265
which will is dedicated to
increasing power for itself

43:39.366 --> 43:40.625
just as you'd expect.

43:59.544 --> 44:04.116
Concentration of wealth
yields concentration of political power,

44:04.216 --> 44:09.521
particularly so as the
cost of elections skyrockets,

44:09.621 --> 44:15.090
which kind of forces the political parties
into the pockets of major corporations.

44:17.827 --> 44:22.532
The Citizens United,
this was January 2009, I guess,

44:22.632 --> 44:26.469
that's a very important decision,
Supreme Court decision,

44:26.569 --> 44:29.649
but it has a history
and you got to think about the history.

44:30.671 --> 44:34.075
The 14th amendment
has a provision that says,

44:34.175 --> 44:39.680
"no person's rights can be infringed
without due process of law."

44:39.780 --> 44:43.550
And the intent, clearly,
was to protect freed slaves.

44:43.650 --> 44:46.786
Says, "okay, they've got
the protection of the law."

44:46.886 --> 44:50.956
I don't think it's ever been used
for freed slaves, if ever, marginally.

44:51.056 --> 44:55.527
Almost immediately, it was used
for businesses, corporations.

44:55.627 --> 44:58.897
Their rights can't be infringed
without due process of law.

44:58.997 --> 45:02.665
So they gradually became
persons under the law.

45:08.304 --> 45:12.073
Corporations are
state-created legal fictions.

45:14.743 --> 45:16.312
Maybe they're good,
maybe they're bad,

45:16.412 --> 45:19.215
but to call them persons
is kind of outrageous.

45:19.315 --> 45:22.952
So they got personal rights
back about a century ago,

45:23.052 --> 45:25.352
and that extended
through the 20th century.

45:27.655 --> 45:31.490
They give corporations rights
way beyond what persons have.

45:31.992 --> 45:35.562
So if, say, General Motors
invests in Mexico,

45:35.662 --> 45:39.198
they get national rights,
the rights of a Mexican business.

45:39.298 --> 45:42.382
While the notion of person
was expanded

45:42.483 --> 45:44.301
to include corporations,

45:44.401 --> 45:46.303
it was also restricted.

45:46.403 --> 45:49.005
If you take the
14th amendment literally,

45:49.105 --> 45:53.115
then no undocumented alien
can be deprived of rights,

45:53.216 --> 45:54.974
if they're persons.

45:57.511 --> 45:59.619
Yet, undocumented aliens
who are living here,

45:59.720 --> 46:00.948
and building your buildings,

46:01.048 --> 46:04.014
cleaning your lawns, and so on,
they're not persons...

46:06.817 --> 46:12.123
But General Electric is a person,
an immortal super-powerful person.

46:12.223 --> 46:18.162
This perversion of the elementary morality,

46:18.262 --> 46:19.833
and the obvious meaning of the law,

46:19.934 --> 46:21.429
it's quite incredible.

46:23.332 --> 46:28.301
In the 1970s, the courts decided
that money is a form of speech.

46:30.437 --> 46:31.538
Buckley vs. Valeo.

46:31.639 --> 46:34.442
Then you go on through the years
to Citizens United,

46:34.542 --> 46:37.645
which says that,
the right of free speech of corporations,

46:37.745 --> 46:39.884
namely to spend as much
money as they want,

46:39.985 --> 46:41.513
that can't be curtailed.

46:44.852 --> 46:46.589
Take a look what that means...

46:46.689 --> 46:48.167
It means that corporations,

46:48.268 --> 46:50.824
which anyway have been
pretty much buying elections,

46:50.924 --> 46:53.927
are now free to do it
with virtually no constraint.

46:54.027 --> 46:58.662
That's a tremendous attack
on the residue of democracy.

47:02.834 --> 47:06.705
It's very interesting to read the rulings,
like justice Kennedy's swing vote.

47:06.805 --> 47:09.340
His ruling said,
"Well, look, after all,

47:09.440 --> 47:12.855
CBS is given freedom of speech,
they're a corporation,

47:12.956 --> 47:14.411
why shouldn't General Electric

47:14.511 --> 47:16.671
be free to spend as much
money as they want?"

47:18.279 --> 47:21.216
I mean, it's true that CBS
is given freedom of speech,

47:21.316 --> 47:24.169
but they're supposed to be
performing a public service.

47:24.270 --> 47:25.386
That's why.

47:25.486 --> 47:27.087
That's what the press is supposed to be,

47:27.187 --> 47:29.189
and General Electric
is trying to make money

47:29.289 --> 47:31.870
for the chief executive
and some of the shareholders.

47:34.158 --> 47:38.263
It's an incredible decision,
and it puts the country in a position where

47:38.363 --> 47:43.868
business power is greatly extended
beyond what it always was.

47:43.968 --> 47:45.702
This is part of that vicious cycle.

47:45.802 --> 47:49.772
The supreme court justices
are put in by reactionary presidents,

47:49.872 --> 47:52.941
who get in there because
they're funded by business.

47:53.041 --> 47:54.507
It's the way the cycle works.

48:20.199 --> 48:24.837
There is one organized force
which traditionally, plenty of flaws,

48:24.937 --> 48:28.841
but with all its flaws,
it's been in the forefront of...

48:29.541 --> 48:33.211
efforts to improve the lives
of the general population.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.812
That's organized labor.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.247
It's also a barrier to corporate tyranny.

48:37.347 --> 48:40.529
So, it's the one barrier
to this vicious cycle

48:40.629 --> 48:44.051
going on, which does lead
to corporate tyranny.

48:53.427 --> 48:56.998
A major reason
for the concentrated,

48:57.298 --> 49:00.935
almost fanatic attack on unions,
on organized labor,

49:01.035 --> 49:03.268
is they are a democratizing force.

49:05.004 --> 49:08.541
They brought a barrier
that defends workers' rights,

49:08.641 --> 49:10.561
but also popular rights generally.

49:17.648 --> 49:21.754
And that interferes with
the prerogatives and power

49:21.854 --> 49:24.920
of those who own
and manage the society.

49:26.188 --> 49:29.358
I should say that anti-union

49:29.458 --> 49:33.562
sentiment in the United States
among elites is so strong

49:33.662 --> 49:37.098
that the fundamental
core of labor rights,

49:37.298 --> 49:41.068
the basic principle in the
international labor organization,

49:41.268 --> 49:44.104
is the right of free association,

49:44.204 --> 49:46.306
which would mean
the right to form unions.

49:46.406 --> 49:48.941
The U.S. has never ratified that.

49:49.041 --> 49:54.112
So I think the U.S. may be alone
among major societies in that respect.

49:54.612 --> 49:58.616
It's considered so far out
of the spectrum of American politics,

49:58.716 --> 50:00.748
it literally has never been considered.

50:03.086 --> 50:07.623
Remember, the U.S. has a long
and very violent labor history

50:07.723 --> 50:10.056
as compared with
comparable societies...

50:12.626 --> 50:15.196
But the labor movement
had been very strong.

50:15.296 --> 50:17.198
By the 1920s,

50:17.299 --> 50:20.390
in a period not unlike today,

50:20.491 --> 50:22.002
it was virtually crushed.

50:22.102 --> 50:26.707
"A truck drivers strike was climaxed
by severe riots with many casualties.

50:27.107 --> 50:29.926
Open warfare rages through
the streets of the city

50:30.026 --> 50:33.178
as 3,000 union pickets
battle 700 police.

50:33.278 --> 50:36.080
Guns, tear gas, clubs and fists
bring injuries

50:36.180 --> 50:39.214
to more than 80 persons
and caused the death of two."

50:44.119 --> 50:46.519
By the mid '30s,
it began to reconstruct.

50:49.586 --> 50:52.124
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he himself

50:52.224 --> 50:55.363
was rather sympathetic
to progressive legislation

50:55.463 --> 50:58.132
that would be in the benefit
of the general population,

50:58.232 --> 51:00.601
but he had to somehow
get it passed.

51:00.701 --> 51:06.406
So he informed labor leaders
and others, "force me to do it."

51:06.706 --> 51:10.779
What he meant is,
go out and demonstrate,

51:10.880 --> 51:12.912
organize, protest,

51:13.012 --> 51:15.014
develop the labor movement.

51:15.314 --> 51:17.382
When the popular pressure is sufficient,

51:17.482 --> 51:19.750
I'll be able to put through
the legislation you want.

51:19.850 --> 51:24.921
"I am not for a return
to that definition of Liberty,

51:25.021 --> 51:28.958
under which for many years
a free people

51:29.058 --> 51:35.564
were being gradually regimented
into the service of a privileged few.

51:35.964 --> 51:40.435
I prefer that broader definition of Liberty."

51:41.135 --> 51:45.005
So, there was kind of a combination
of a sympathetic government,

51:45.105 --> 51:49.172
and by the mid-'30s,
very substantial popular activism.

51:50.474 --> 51:54.679
There were industrial actions.
There were sit-down strikes,

51:54.779 --> 51:58.816
which were very frightening
to ownership.

51:58.916 --> 52:00.292
You have to recognize,

52:00.393 --> 52:04.087
a sit-down strike is just
one step before saying,

52:04.187 --> 52:06.854
"we don't need bosses.
We can run this by ourselves."

52:13.694 --> 52:15.296
And business was appalled.

52:15.396 --> 52:18.766
You read the business press,
say, in the late '30s,

52:18.866 --> 52:23.270
they were talking about
the "hazard facing industrialists"

52:23.370 --> 52:26.706
and the "rising political power
of the masses,"

52:26.806 --> 52:28.374
which has to be repressed.

52:28.474 --> 52:31.276
Things were on hold
during the second world war,

52:31.376 --> 52:33.606
but immediately after
the second world war,

52:33.707 --> 52:36.199
the business offensive
began in force.

52:36.300 --> 52:38.182
The Taft-Hartley act.

52:38.482 --> 52:41.752
"The Taft-Hartley act
was written for only one purpose,

52:41.852 --> 52:47.324
to restore justice and equality
in labor-management relations."

52:47.724 --> 52:49.292
Then McCarthyism was used

52:49.393 --> 52:53.293
for massive corporate propaganda
offensives to attack union.

52:54.195 --> 52:56.464
It increased sharply
during the Reagan years.

52:56.564 --> 52:59.600
I mean, Reagan pretty much told
the business world,

52:59.700 --> 53:03.203
"If you want to illegally break
organizing efforts and strikes,

53:03.504 --> 53:04.571
go ahead."

53:04.671 --> 53:07.006
"They are in violation of the law,

53:07.106 --> 53:10.376
and if they do not report
for work within 48 hours,

53:10.476 --> 53:14.713
they have forfeited their jobs
and will be terminated."

53:14.813 --> 53:18.590
It continued in the '90s and, of course,
with George W. Bush,

53:18.691 --> 53:19.884
it went through the roof.

53:19.984 --> 53:25.254
By now, less than 7% of
private sector workers have unions.

53:30.626 --> 53:35.698
The effect is that the usual
counter-force to an offensive

53:35.798 --> 53:40.700
by our highly class-conscious
business class has dissolved.

53:43.904 --> 53:47.074
Now, if you're in a position of power,

53:47.174 --> 53:50.444
you want to maintain
class-consciousness for yourself,

53:50.544 --> 53:52.812
but eliminate it everywhere else.

53:52.912 --> 53:55.515
You go back to the 19th century,

53:55.615 --> 53:58.040
in the early days of
the industrial revolution

53:58.141 --> 53:59.351
in the United States,

53:59.451 --> 54:02.554
working people were
very conscious of this.

54:02.854 --> 54:06.524
They, in fact,
overwhelmingly regarded

54:06.624 --> 54:10.594
wage labor as not
very different from slavery,

54:10.694 --> 54:13.396
different only in that
it was temporary.

54:13.496 --> 54:15.208
In fact, it was such a popular idea

54:15.309 --> 54:17.530
that it was the slogan
of the Republican party.

54:18.532 --> 54:22.036
That was a very sharp
class-consciousness.

54:22.336 --> 54:24.771
In the interest of power and privilege,

54:24.871 --> 54:28.407
it's good to drive those ideas
out of people's heads.

54:28.507 --> 54:31.643
You don't want them to know
that they're an oppressed class.

54:31.743 --> 54:35.813
So, this is one of the few societies
in which you just don't talk about class.

54:36.013 --> 54:39.083
In fact, the notion of class
is very simple.

54:39.183 --> 54:41.318
Who gives the orders?
Who follows them?

54:41.418 --> 54:43.486
That basically defines class.

54:43.586 --> 54:47.254
It's more nuanced and complex,
but that's basically it.

55:05.639 --> 55:09.143
The public relations industry,
the advertising industry,

55:09.243 --> 55:11.378
which is dedicated
to creating consumers,

55:11.478 --> 55:14.748
it's a phenomena that developed
in the freest countries,

55:14.848 --> 55:19.486
in Britain and the United States,
and the reason is pretty clear.

55:19.586 --> 55:22.856
It became clear by, say, a century ago

55:22.956 --> 55:27.193
that it was not going to be so easy
to control the population by force.

55:27.293 --> 55:28.833
Too much freedom had been won.

55:30.227 --> 55:33.564
Labor organizing, parliamentary
labor parties in many countries,

55:33.664 --> 55:36.466
women starting to get
the franchise, and so on.

55:36.566 --> 55:38.768
So, you had to have other
means of controlling people.

55:38.868 --> 55:41.337
And it was understood and expressed

55:41.437 --> 55:47.475
that you have to control them
by control of beliefs and attitudes.

55:47.575 --> 55:51.612
Well, one of the best ways
to control people in terms of attitudes

55:51.712 --> 55:57.078
is what the great political economist
Thorstein Veblen called

55:57.179 --> 55:58.749
"fabricating consumers."

56:04.588 --> 56:07.125
If you can fabricate wants...

56:07.625 --> 56:12.863
Make obtaining things that are just about
within your reach the essence of life,

56:12.963 --> 56:16.330
they're going to be trapped
into becoming consumers.

56:18.700 --> 56:21.437
You read the business press
in say, 1920s,

56:21.537 --> 56:27.075
it talks about the need to direct people
to the superficial things of life,

56:27.175 --> 56:28.908
like "fashionable consumption"

56:29.009 --> 56:31.015
and that'll keep them out of our hair.

56:32.545 --> 56:36.650
You find this doctrine all through
progressive intellectual thought,

56:36.750 --> 56:38.218
like Walter Lippmann,

56:38.318 --> 56:41.538
the major progressive intellectual
of the 20th century.

56:43.688 --> 56:46.939
He wrote famous progressive
essays on democracy

56:47.040 --> 56:49.327
in which his view was exactly that.

56:49.427 --> 56:51.796
"The public must be put in their place,"

56:51.896 --> 56:54.698
so that the responsible men
can make decisions

56:54.798 --> 56:57.798
without interference
from the "bewildered herd."

57:00.435 --> 57:02.471
They're to be spectators,
not participants.

57:02.571 --> 57:05.307
Then you get a properly
functioning democracy,

57:05.407 --> 57:07.457
straight back to Madison,

57:07.558 --> 57:10.712
and on to Powell's memorandum,
and so on.

57:10.812 --> 57:17.718
And the advertising industry
just exploded with this as its goal...

57:17.818 --> 57:19.350
Fabricating consumers.

57:25.157 --> 57:27.827
And it's done with great sophistication.

57:28.527 --> 57:30.629
"You don't see many
wild stallions anymore.

57:30.729 --> 57:35.397
He's one of the last of a wild
and very singular breed.

57:35.898 --> 57:38.835
Come to Marlboro country."

57:39.135 --> 57:41.668
The ideal is what you actually see today...

57:43.404 --> 57:47.809
Where, let's say, teenage girls,
if they have a free Saturday afternoon,

57:47.909 --> 57:50.311
will go walking in the shopping mall,

57:50.611 --> 57:53.177
not to the library or somewhere else.

57:53.912 --> 57:57.316
The idea is to try to control everyone,

57:57.616 --> 58:01.283
to turn the whole society
into the perfect system.

58:03.753 --> 58:08.792
Perfect system would be
a society based on a dyad, a pair.

58:08.892 --> 58:11.995
The pair is you
and your television set,

58:12.295 --> 58:14.397
or maybe now you and the Internet,

58:14.997 --> 58:19.701
in which that presents you with
what the proper life would be,

58:19.801 --> 58:21.803
what kind of gadgets
you should have.

58:21.903 --> 58:24.539
And you spend your time and effort
gaining those things,

58:24.639 --> 58:26.168
which you don't need,
and you don't want,

58:26.269 --> 58:27.799
and maybe you'll throw them away...

58:29.242 --> 58:32.209
But that's the measure of a decent life.

58:34.846 --> 58:38.617
What we see is in, say,
advertising on television,

58:38.717 --> 58:42.554
if you've ever taken an economics course,
you know that

58:42.654 --> 58:48.693
markets are supposed to be based on
"informed consumers making rational choices."

58:48.793 --> 58:52.496
Well, if we had a system
like that, a market system,

58:52.596 --> 58:57.133
then a television ad would
consist of, say, General Motors

58:57.233 --> 59:01.103
putting up information, saying,
"here's what we have for sale."

59:01.203 --> 59:03.805
That's not what an ad for a car is.

59:03.905 --> 59:08.407
And ad for a car is a football hero...
an actress...

59:08.507 --> 59:11.578
the car doing some crazy thing like,

59:11.678 --> 59:13.580
going up a mountain or something.

59:13.680 --> 59:19.785
The point is to create uninformed consumers
who will make irrational choices.

59:19.885 --> 59:22.354
That's what advertising is all about,

59:22.554 --> 59:27.892
and when the same institution,
the PR system,

59:27.992 --> 59:30.458
runs elections,
they do it the same way.

59:36.331 --> 59:39.034
They want to create
an uninformed electorate,

59:39.134 --> 59:41.350
which will make irrational choices,

59:41.451 --> 59:43.505
often against their own interests,

59:43.605 --> 59:48.006
and we see it every time
one of these extravaganzas take place.

59:49.842 --> 59:51.845
Right after the election,

59:51.945 --> 59:56.983
president Obama won an award
from the advertising industry

59:57.083 --> 59:58.885
for the best marketing campaign.

59:58.985 --> 01:00:00.154
And, it wasn't reported here,

01:00:00.255 --> 01:00:02.254
but if you go to the
international business press,

01:00:02.454 --> 01:00:04.957
executives were euphoric.

01:00:05.057 --> 01:00:09.748
They said, "we've been selling candidates,
marketing candidates,

01:00:09.849 --> 01:00:11.696
like, you know, toothpaste

01:00:11.796 --> 01:00:12.903
ever since Reagan,

01:00:13.004 --> 01:00:15.699
and this is the greatest
achievement we have."

01:00:15.799 --> 01:00:18.835
I don't usually agree with Sarah Palin,

01:00:18.935 --> 01:00:24.606
but when she mocks the, what she calls
the "hopey-changey" stuff, she's right.

01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:27.588
First of all, Obama didn't
really promise anything.

01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:29.310
That's mostly illusion.

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:32.579
You go back to the campaign rhetoric
and take a look at it.

01:00:32.679 --> 01:00:35.195
There's very little discussion
of policy issues,

01:00:35.296 --> 01:00:36.683
and for very good reason,

01:00:36.783 --> 01:00:42.021
because public opinion on policy
is sharply disconnected

01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:46.856
from what the two-party leadership
and their financial backers want.

01:00:48.193 --> 01:00:55.030
Policy, more and more, is focused on the
private interests that fund the campaigns...

01:00:56.165 --> 01:00:58.432
with the public being marginalized.

01:01:21.522 --> 01:01:26.027
One of the leading political scientists,
Martin Gilens, came out with a study

01:01:26.127 --> 01:01:29.063
of the relation between
public attitudes and public policy.

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:32.906
What he shows is that
about 70% of the population

01:01:33.007 --> 01:01:35.702
has no way of influencing policy.

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:38.435
They might as well be
in some other country...

01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:41.170
And the population knows it.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:50.211
What it's led to is a population that's
angry, frustrated, hates institutions.

01:01:51.813 --> 01:01:56.215
It's not acting constructively
to try to respond to this.

01:01:57.984 --> 01:02:00.821
There is popular mobilization and activism,

01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:03.587
but in very self-destructive directions.

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:08.193
It's taking the form of unfocused anger,

01:02:08.293 --> 01:02:11.829
attacks on one another,
and on vulnerable targets.

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:14.229
That's what happens in cases like this.

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:21.604
It is corrosive of social relations,
but that's the point.

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:25.908
The point is to make people
hate and fear each other,

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:27.910
and look out only for themselves,

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.210
and don't do anything for anyone else.

01:02:33.947 --> 01:02:38.619
One place you see it strikingly
is on April 15th.

01:02:38.719 --> 01:02:42.155
April 15th is kind of a measure,
the day you pay your taxes,

01:02:42.255 --> 01:02:45.158
of how democratic the society is.

01:02:45.258 --> 01:02:48.928
If a society is really democratic,

01:02:49.028 --> 01:02:52.031
April 15th would be a day of celebration.

01:02:52.131 --> 01:02:55.033
It's a day when
the population gets together,

01:02:55.233 --> 01:03:01.539
decides to fund the programs and activities
that they have formulated and agreed upon.

01:03:01.639 --> 01:03:03.048
What could be better than that?

01:03:03.149 --> 01:03:04.608
So, you should celebrate it.

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:06.509
It's not the way it is
in the United States.

01:03:06.809 --> 01:03:08.811
It's a day of mourning.

01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:13.982
It's a day in which some alien power
that has nothing to do with you,

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.985
is coming down to steal
your hard-earned money,

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:19.945
and you do everything you can
to keep them from doing it.

01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:23.958
Well, that is a kind of a measure
of the extent to which,

01:03:24.058 --> 01:03:28.025
at least in popular consciousness,
democracy is actually functioning.

01:03:28.893 --> 01:03:30.926
Not a very attractive picture.

01:03:48.344 --> 01:03:52.115
The tendencies that we've been describing
within American society,

01:03:52.215 --> 01:03:56.853
unless they're reversed,
it's going to be an extremely ugly society.

01:03:56.953 --> 01:03:59.889
I mean, a society that's based on

01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:05.158
Adam Smith's vile maxim,
"all for myself, nothing for anyone else."

01:04:10.197 --> 01:04:14.102
A society in which normal
human instincts and emotion

01:04:14.202 --> 01:04:18.737
of sympathy, solidarity, mutual support,
in which they're, kind like, driven out...

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:23.871
That's a society so ugly,

01:04:23.972 --> 01:04:25.845
I don't even know
who'd want to live in it.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:27.911
I wouldn't want my children to.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:37.022
If the society is based on
control by private wealth,

01:04:37.122 --> 01:04:41.156
it will reflect the values
that it, in fact, does reflect.

01:04:43.259 --> 01:04:45.856
The value that is greed,
and the desire...

01:04:45.957 --> 01:04:48.495
to maximize personal gain,
at the expense of others.

01:04:48.695 --> 01:04:53.327
Now, any society, maybe a small society
based on that principle is ugly,

01:04:53.428 --> 01:04:54.737
but it can survive.

01:04:54.837 --> 01:04:58.838
A global society based on that principle
is headed for massive destruction.

01:05:04.076 --> 01:05:07.694
I don't think we're smart enough...

01:05:07.795 --> 01:05:10.348
to design in any detail...

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:14.585
what a perfectly just and free
society would be like.

01:05:14.685 --> 01:05:17.087
I think we can give some guidelines...

01:05:17.187 --> 01:05:22.590
and, more significant, we can ask
how we can progress in that direction.

01:05:26.862 --> 01:05:31.334
John Dewey, the leading social philosopher
in the late 20th century,

01:05:31.434 --> 01:05:34.770
he argued that until all institutions,

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.807
production, commerce, media,

01:05:38.907 --> 01:05:42.977
unless they're all under
participatory democratic control,

01:05:43.077 --> 01:05:47.378
we will not have
a functioning democratic society.

01:05:48.847 --> 01:05:53.116
As he put it, "policy will be the shadow
cast by business over society."

01:05:57.288 --> 01:05:59.255
Well, it's essentially true.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:14.404
Where there are structures of
authority, domination and hierarchy,

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.581
somebody gives the orders,
somebody takes them,

01:06:16.882 --> 01:06:19.342
they are not self-justifying.

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.585
They have to justify themselves.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:24.010
They have a burden of proof to meet.

01:06:30.517 --> 01:06:34.722
Well, if you take a close look, usually
you find they can't justify themselves.

01:06:34.922 --> 01:06:37.555
If they can't, we ought
to be dismantling them.

01:06:38.924 --> 01:06:41.894
Trying to expand the domain
of freedom and justice

01:06:41.994 --> 01:06:45.964
by dismantling that form
of illegitimate authority.

01:06:46.064 --> 01:06:48.967
And, in fact,
progress over the years,

01:06:49.067 --> 01:06:52.120
what we all thankfully recognize as progress,

01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:53.404
has been just that.

01:06:53.504 --> 01:06:57.575
The way things change is because
lots of people are working all the time.

01:06:57.975 --> 01:07:00.684
They're working in their communities,
in their workplace,

01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:02.079
or wherever they happen to be,

01:07:02.179 --> 01:07:04.482
and they're building up the basis

01:07:04.582 --> 01:07:08.118
for popular movements,
which are going to make changes.

01:07:08.418 --> 01:07:11.151
That's the way everything
has ever happened in history.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.990
Take, say, freedom of speech...

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:18.593
One of the real achievements
of American society,

01:07:18.693 --> 01:07:20.335
it's first in the world in that.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.029
It's not in the bill of rights.

01:07:22.129 --> 01:07:24.398
It's not in the constitution.

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:28.235
Freedom of speech issues
began to come to the supreme court

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.234
in the early 20th century.

01:07:31.369 --> 01:07:34.606
The major contributions came in the 1960s.

01:07:34.706 --> 01:07:38.376
One of the leading ones was a case
involving the civil rights movement.

01:07:38.476 --> 01:07:41.445
Well, by then, you had
a mass popular movement,

01:07:41.545 --> 01:07:43.947
which was demanding rights,

01:07:44.347 --> 01:07:47.450
refusing to back down.
And in that context,

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:49.158
the supreme court did establish

01:07:49.259 --> 01:07:51.520
a pretty high standard
of freedom of speech.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.823
Or take, say, women's rights.

01:07:54.323 --> 01:07:58.126
Women also began
identifying oppressive structures,

01:07:58.226 --> 01:08:02.530
refusing to accept them,
bringing other people to join with them.

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.033
Well, that's how rights are won.

01:08:06.033 --> 01:08:10.537
To a non-trivial extent,
I've also spent a lot of my life in activism.

01:08:10.637 --> 01:08:13.515
That doesn't show up publicly, but, yeah...

01:08:13.616 --> 01:08:17.106
Actually, I'm not terribly good at it...
I'm not the greatest organizer...

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:21.514
I think that we can see quite clearly
some very, very serious defects

01:08:21.613 --> 01:08:25.550
and flaws in our society,
our level of culture, our institutions,

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:29.287
which are going to have to be corrected
by operating outside of the framework

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:31.122
that is commonly accepted.

01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:34.341
I think we're going to have to find
new ways of political action.

01:08:36.725 --> 01:08:40.926
But the activists are the people
who have created the rights that we enjoy.

01:08:41.962 --> 01:08:44.165
They're not only carrying out...

01:08:44.265 --> 01:08:47.533
policies based on
information that they're receiving,

01:08:47.634 --> 01:08:49.801
but also contributing to the understanding.

01:08:49.902 --> 01:08:51.968
Remember, it's a reciprocal process.

01:08:53.037 --> 01:08:56.107
- ...then you have a great deal of...
- You try to do things. You learn.

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:58.375
You learn about what the world is like,

01:08:58.475 --> 01:09:02.010
that feeds back to the understanding
of how to go on.

01:09:05.281 --> 01:09:07.283
There's huge opportunities.

01:09:07.384 --> 01:09:11.451
It is a very free society,
still the freest in the world.

01:09:12.685 --> 01:09:16.122
Government has very
limited capacity to coerce.

01:09:16.223 --> 01:09:20.294
Corporate business may try to coerce,
but they don't have the mechanisms.

01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:24.930
So, there's a lot that can be done
if people organize, struggle for their rights

01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:29.031
as they've done in the past,
and can win many victories.

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:46.880
Well, my close friend for many years,
the late Howard Zinn...

01:09:49.116 --> 01:09:51.618
To put it in his words that,

01:09:51.718 --> 01:09:56.923
"what matters is the countless
small deeds of unknown people,

01:09:57.023 --> 01:10:02.092
who lay the basis for the significant events
that enter history."

01:10:04.261 --> 01:10:06.898
They're the ones
who've done things in the past.

01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:09.279
They're the ones
 who'll have to do it in the future.
