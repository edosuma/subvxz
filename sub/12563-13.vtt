00:00.918 --> 00:02.251
<i>Previously on Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.252 --> 00:03.419
- I didn't know you were adopted.

00:03.420 --> 00:04.887
Neither did I.

00:04.888 --> 00:06.355
- You've never gotten over Christina.

00:06.356 --> 00:08.791
You set me up with her to prove
to yourself and to her...

00:08.792 --> 00:10.426
That's enough!

00:10.427 --> 00:11.928
I think we're done, Hank.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.396
I couldn't agree more.

00:13.397 --> 00:15.698
- I have to get back on the road
with the polo team.

00:15.699 --> 00:16.866
Of course.

00:16.867 --> 00:19.302
When he calls, I get butterflies
in my stomach.

00:19.303 --> 00:23.005
When he leaves the room
even for a moment, I miss him.

00:23.006 --> 00:25.808
- Divya and I have a completely
professional relationship.

00:25.809 --> 00:28.110
Do you have feelings for her?

00:28.111 --> 00:29.545
- I've been thinking about
what you said

00:29.546 --> 00:32.415
About who you wanted in your life.

00:32.415 --> 00:34.217
I think I can be that guy.

00:34.218 --> 00:36.118
- Are you looking for Paige?
- Yes, yes.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.754
- What's it regarding?
I'm her fiance.

00:38.755 --> 00:41.591
I'm... Her mother.

00:44.592 --> 00:46.592
"By moideen"

00:49.900 --> 00:52.902
I never saw my baby again.

00:52.903 --> 00:55.104
It broke my heart.

00:55.105 --> 00:58.007
- And then you saw her on the news?

00:58.008 --> 00:59.308
Yes.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.244
And the details of Paige's adoption

01:01.245 --> 01:04.247
Match when and where I gave birth.

01:04.248 --> 01:06.649
- A date and place
that were widely reported.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.918
- Evan, I understand
why you're skeptical,

01:08.919 --> 01:10.119
And I would be too.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.256
But I have hired
private investigators,

01:13.257 --> 01:17.426
Attorneys, even psychics to try
and help me find my daughter.

01:17.427 --> 01:21.764
And all they've ever
done is take my money.

01:21.765 --> 01:24.600
- So this is the part where
you say you need a loan, right?

01:24.601 --> 01:27.970
- The only reason I drove here
from New Mexico

01:27.971 --> 01:31.274
Was to see Paige and find out
if she's my daughter.

01:31.275 --> 01:34.343
I don't want anything else.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.614
But I'm impressed
with how protective you are.

01:38.615 --> 01:41.550
You must really love her.

01:41.551 --> 01:43.653
I do.

01:47.057 --> 01:50.793
- Well, I'm going to be in town
for a while.

01:50.794 --> 01:54.297
Although I may need to go back
and bid for a job.

01:54.298 --> 01:56.198
Oh, are you a contractor?

01:56.199 --> 01:58.067
- No.
I'm an artist.

01:59.503 --> 02:01.237
Hmm.

02:06.476 --> 02:09.145
- I have to say
I find exercising with you

02:09.145 --> 02:10.880
Very rewarding.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.684
- And I have always wanted
a workout partner.

02:16.153 --> 02:18.854
But I'm enjoying this too.

02:18.855 --> 02:20.890
Coffee, view, small talk.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.025
- I'm actually known
for my small talk.

02:23.026 --> 02:24.860
- Great.
Because I have tons

02:24.861 --> 02:26.495
Of unimportant things left to say,

02:26.496 --> 02:28.864
And I don't have to be
at my office until noon.

02:28.865 --> 02:31.567
- Ooh.
I have a staff meeting at 10:30.

02:31.568 --> 02:37.406
But I am letting Evan know
that I won't be there.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.808
Sorry, ev.

02:38.809 --> 02:41.310
Sorry, ev.

02:41.311 --> 02:45.047
You know, they say a sign of
a really healthy couple

02:45.048 --> 02:48.484
Is when you can just
sit together and say nothing.

02:48.485 --> 02:51.253
- That could also be the sign of
a really unhealthy couple.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.590
But I like your take on it.

02:58.895 --> 03:00.396
Is that what's happening right now?

03:00.397 --> 03:01.564
'Cause I just... why... we...

03:01.565 --> 03:02.598
Because that's why we're healthy.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.233
Harper?

03:04.234 --> 03:06.001
How is my favorite doctor
in the hamptons?

03:06.002 --> 03:07.803
If I see her, I'll ask.

03:07.804 --> 03:09.905
Smart, hot, and funny.

03:09.906 --> 03:11.440
God, life is unfair.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.908
Talia clarke.
So pleased to meet you.

03:12.909 --> 03:15.544
- Hank Lawson.
Pleased to meet you, too.

03:15.545 --> 03:17.213
Talia's a pharmaceutical rep.

03:17.214 --> 03:18.781
- Still pleased?
Don't answer that.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.349
Just so you know,

03:20.350 --> 03:23.285
I'm not your average rep
or your below average rep.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.554
I do my research,
I believe in my products,

03:25.555 --> 03:28.758
And I know Hankmed and I
would work beautifully together.

03:28.759 --> 03:30.025
You know I'm a doctor?

03:30.026 --> 03:31.961
- Told you.
I do my research.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.363
So how would you like to be

03:34.364 --> 03:36.365
My new favorite doctor
in the hamptons?

03:36.366 --> 03:38.234
- Just like that,
I've been dethroned.

03:38.235 --> 03:39.802
I've got a new drug.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.304
Just came on the market,
and it's a game changer.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.373
It's perfect for you.
- It is?

03:44.374 --> 03:45.741
- Your clients jet
all around the world,

03:45.742 --> 03:47.877
And what do the jet set need?
- Jets?

03:47.878 --> 03:49.779
Funny.

03:49.780 --> 03:51.580
But not as funny as you, dear.

03:51.581 --> 03:53.949
- Just give him time.
He grows on you.

03:53.950 --> 03:56.318
They need their sleep.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.721
My drug's called lullabrex
and it's a sleep aid,

03:58.722 --> 04:00.189
But this one has fewer side effects

04:00.190 --> 04:01.857
Than everything else out there.

04:01.858 --> 04:03.259
- You know who you should talk to...

04:03.260 --> 04:04.727
- Evan r. Lawson,
the cfo of Hankmed.

04:04.728 --> 04:05.961
Are you kidding me?

04:05.962 --> 04:07.830
That man should get a second job
as a brick wall.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.932
- Yeah.
Hankmed has a no-see policy

04:09.933 --> 04:11.634
With pharmaceutical reps, no offense.

04:11.635 --> 04:12.968
No, none taken.

04:12.969 --> 04:14.837
The only people dodged
more often than pharma reps

04:14.838 --> 04:16.439
Are process servers.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.676
Hank, I do what I do for the
same reason you do what you do...

04:20.677 --> 04:23.212
Because I love helping people.

04:24.748 --> 04:28.451
- Can you be at my office
at 10:30?

04:28.452 --> 04:31.020
- I promise, it will not be
a waste of your time.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.321
You are right about that.

04:32.322 --> 04:33.522
- Excellent.
See you then.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.124
- Mm-hmm.
- Bye, harp.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.525
Bye, talia.

04:38.295 --> 04:40.429
- I grow on you?
- Mmm.

- Do you have any idea how many
long-lost brothers, sisters,

05:35.760 --> 05:37.794
Moms, and dads have contacted
my parents

05:37.795 --> 05:39.763
Since the story broke?

05:39.764 --> 05:42.432
- Yes, and I know there are
a lot of opportunists out there.

05:42.433 --> 05:45.802
- Within minutes, they all shift
to some sob story

05:45.803 --> 05:48.972
About a desperate need for money
or clemency

05:48.973 --> 05:52.742
Or a government appointment
with a generous stipend.

05:52.743 --> 05:55.011
I mean, who's to say this woman
isn't just another one of them?

05:55.012 --> 05:56.813
- Nobody.
She may be, okay?

05:56.814 --> 06:00.951
I don't want you get your hopes
up either, but...

06:00.952 --> 06:03.119
There's just something about her,

06:03.120 --> 06:06.089
Like she seems really...

06:06.090 --> 06:07.724
Real.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.627
Okay.

06:10.628 --> 06:12.529
What's her name again?

06:12.530 --> 06:14.831
Lou Hunter.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.067
Good morning.

06:17.068 --> 06:18.802
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:18.803 --> 06:20.136
Bad time.

06:20.137 --> 06:23.273
- No, I was just leaving so...

06:25.409 --> 06:27.043
Bye.

06:27.044 --> 06:28.578
Bye.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.782
What up, Katdare?

06:32.783 --> 06:35.452
I thought you were driving fabio
to the airport.

06:35.453 --> 06:37.621
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's Rafa.

06:37.622 --> 06:40.657
And a couple of his teammates
wanted to bum a ride.

06:40.658 --> 06:42.692
He couldn't say no,
and I don't have enough room

06:42.693 --> 06:44.761
To chauffeur the entire polo team.

06:44.762 --> 06:46.763
- It's better that way, right?

06:46.764 --> 06:48.898
No melodramatic,
tearful good-bye at the gate.

06:48.899 --> 06:51.101
- Instead, a melodramatic
tearful good-bye at his hotel

06:51.102 --> 06:52.902
In front of his whole team.

06:52.903 --> 06:54.537
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:56.774 --> 06:58.742
Wow.

06:58.743 --> 07:01.444
You really like this guy.
- Yeah, I do.

07:01.445 --> 07:04.214
I miss him already.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.349
Hmm.

07:06.350 --> 07:07.550
Well, just so you know,

07:07.551 --> 07:09.853
If you ever wanna...
- Hey, Rafa.

07:09.854 --> 07:11.588
- Talk about it...
- Rafa. Rafa!

07:11.589 --> 07:12.656
Can you hear me?
- Or something.

07:12.657 --> 07:15.392
Rafa, can you... Rafa.

07:18.929 --> 07:21.197
- Ho!
Oh.

07:25.603 --> 07:27.771
- Maybe you should be known for
more than just small talk.

07:29.874 --> 07:31.441
So I do grow on you.

07:31.442 --> 07:34.878
Yeah, you do.

07:34.879 --> 07:36.212
Hmm.

07:36.213 --> 07:39.149
- Usually the more time
I spend with a guy,

07:39.150 --> 07:40.750
The less fond I am of him.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.385
You've got high standards.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.754
Or bad luck.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.589
What's your excuse?

07:46.590 --> 07:48.858
Never found the right woman.

07:48.859 --> 07:51.895
Or if I did, I don't know.

07:51.896 --> 07:53.997
I couldn't seem to make it work.

07:53.998 --> 07:55.832
Maybe your luck is changing.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.233
Maybe.

07:57.234 --> 07:59.936
Take now.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.438
We're both on-call,

08:01.439 --> 08:05.442
But neither one of us has been
called by a patient.

08:12.183 --> 08:14.584
I'll be back.

08:18.923 --> 08:20.557
You had to go and jinx it.

08:20.558 --> 08:22.826
- My bad.
Can you see who it is?

08:22.827 --> 08:24.260
Yup.

08:26.564 --> 08:28.998
It's an edgar pops.
- That's my dad.

08:28.999 --> 08:31.000
Answer it.

08:31.001 --> 08:33.236
- No.
What?

08:33.236 --> 08:35.472
No, the first conversation
I have with your father

08:35.472 --> 08:37.006
Should not be while I'm naked.

08:37.006 --> 08:39.743
- You do understand
phone technology, right?

08:39.744 --> 08:41.211
You know he can't see you.

08:41.212 --> 08:42.846
- Yeah, but I'll know
and you'll know.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.848
We'll know.
Just talk to him.

08:44.849 --> 08:46.349
- All right.
All right.

08:46.350 --> 08:47.584
Hi, dad.

08:47.585 --> 08:50.153
I know.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.223
I can't wait to see you guys either.

08:53.224 --> 08:55.658
Dad, dad, dad, I'm sorry.

08:55.659 --> 08:57.360
I... actually,
I can't talk right now.

08:57.361 --> 08:59.129
I'm with somebody.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.364
Yes, it's him.

09:01.365 --> 09:04.567
Okay.
Thanks, dad.

09:04.568 --> 09:05.969
Love you.
Bye.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.737
"Him"?

09:07.738 --> 09:09.672
Him who?
Him me?

09:09.673 --> 09:11.841
Yes, Tarzan.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.810
I'm close with my parents.

09:13.811 --> 09:17.013
Is that okay?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.581
That's totally okay.

09:18.582 --> 09:20.950
Him like.

09:28.325 --> 09:30.560
A Christina is calling.

09:36.066 --> 09:37.467
Hello.

09:40.404 --> 09:42.038
What?

09:42.039 --> 09:44.107
Where?

09:44.108 --> 09:46.242
I'm sorry, Harper.
I'll call you later.

09:47.845 --> 09:52.048
- Its strength isn't just
that it makes you...

09:52.049 --> 09:53.850
Sleepy

09:53.851 --> 09:56.386
But that there
aren't many side effects.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.490
It just helps you get sleepy
because...

10:00.491 --> 10:02.492
One sec.

10:02.493 --> 10:04.694
- Huh.
Medication mimics

10:04.695 --> 10:07.163
The stimulation
of the cholinergic neurons

10:07.164 --> 10:08.531
On the pedunculopontine nucleus,

10:08.532 --> 10:10.633
And it stimulates the reticular
activating systems

10:10.634 --> 10:13.169
Of one's brain.
- Right.

10:13.170 --> 10:14.204
It's a super drug.

10:15.973 --> 10:20.777
I'm not your average pharma rep
or your below average rep.

10:30.754 --> 10:34.557
I believe you were gonna tell us
more about the drug.

10:36.961 --> 10:38.795
- I must have left the rest of
my presentation

10:38.796 --> 10:40.697
Back at my hotel.

10:40.698 --> 10:43.833
- Wow.
I hate when that happens to me.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.335
- I'll have to come back
tomorrow and finish.

10:45.336 --> 10:47.303
- You know what,
you've done a wonderful job,

10:47.304 --> 10:48.905
And tHank you for coming.

10:48.906 --> 10:51.307
We've... we'll imagine the rest.
You did such a great job...

10:51.308 --> 10:52.575
- Yes.
- We'll just imagine

10:52.576 --> 10:54.177
The end of it.
- Yes, yes, no need to return.

10:54.178 --> 10:56.312
- Okay.
- Great.

10:56.313 --> 10:57.714
Thanks a lot.

10:57.715 --> 10:59.349
Sayonara.

11:01.819 --> 11:04.220
- Wha...
- Why would Hank agree

11:04.221 --> 11:05.889
To see a pharma rep at all,

11:05.890 --> 11:08.458
Let alone a malfunctioning
pharma bot?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.426
- I can't tell if she was
selling the sleeping pills

11:10.427 --> 11:12.428
Or taking them.
- You two should really

11:12.429 --> 11:14.797
Keep your voices down.
- Why? We might wake her?

11:14.798 --> 11:16.199
- I think she's probably coming back.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.367
Why would you think that?

11:17.368 --> 11:18.968
Because she left her laptop.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.971
That's not... that's a laptop.

11:23.908 --> 11:25.275
- Christina told you this?
- Yes.

11:25.276 --> 11:27.944
And she said you would know
where dmitry is

11:27.945 --> 11:30.980
And could arrange
for me to get to him.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.849
- He went in there, by himself.

11:32.850 --> 11:35.118
- In where?
- Not important.

11:35.119 --> 11:36.653
THank you.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.288
So that's it?

11:38.289 --> 11:41.024
- I thought you were done, Hank.

11:41.025 --> 11:43.526
- I'm never done with a patient
who needs my help.

11:43.527 --> 11:44.894
Oh, of course, you're not.

11:44.895 --> 11:46.429
Well, I'll look into
what you've told me.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.897
You'll look into it?

11:47.898 --> 11:51.534
Christina was confused,
panicked about dmitry.

11:51.535 --> 11:54.437
He needs medical help now.
I thought he was your friend.

11:54.438 --> 11:56.039
- It's not your concern...
- Oh, right, I'm sorry.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.440
You don't have friends, do you?

11:57.441 --> 11:59.442
Just people who are useful
to you, like me?

11:59.443 --> 12:01.577
- Did I not just say
I would look into it?

12:01.578 --> 12:03.012
- Well, you better look into it fast,

12:03.013 --> 12:05.982
Because she thinks he may be dying.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.984
Few days after I gave birth,

12:23.985 --> 12:26.353
I was on a bus
heading home to kansas.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.856
What about the baby's father?

12:28.857 --> 12:32.526
- I lost track of him
a long time ago.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.663
Oh, there she is.

12:36.664 --> 12:38.031
One sec.

12:38.032 --> 12:39.199
Hi.
- Hi.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.635
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.070
- You weren't home
when I went to pick you up.

12:43.071 --> 12:44.705
I was in a meeting.

12:44.706 --> 12:47.274
Okay.

12:47.275 --> 12:52.446
So Paige collins, meet Lou Hunter.

12:52.447 --> 12:53.447
Hi, Paige.

12:55.717 --> 12:58.352
I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this moment.

13:01.256 --> 13:04.124
I imagine you have
a million questions for me.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.293
I do.

13:06.294 --> 13:09.530
Evan says you gave your baby up
at birth.

13:09.531 --> 13:12.866
- I never even got to hold her
for a second.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.935
It's my greatest regret.

13:14.936 --> 13:16.703
Really?

13:16.704 --> 13:20.307
More than your drug arrest,
your four bankruptcies,

13:20.308 --> 13:23.911
Or changing your name from Patty
Louise stump to Lou Hunter?

13:23.912 --> 13:25.312
Look, I can explain this.

13:25.313 --> 13:27.447
- Yeah, I had
a background check done,

13:27.448 --> 13:29.016
And it's a good thing too,

13:29.017 --> 13:33.253
Because you are either deluded
or you're just a bad liar.

13:33.254 --> 13:37.925
- I'm not lying, and I never
claimed to be perfect.

13:37.926 --> 13:39.660
- But you did claim to be my mother.

13:39.661 --> 13:41.995
And the one detail my parents
were able to give me

13:41.996 --> 13:44.998
About my birth was that my
birth mother not only held me

13:44.999 --> 13:47.301
But changed her mind
about giving me up.

13:47.302 --> 13:48.669
She wanted to keep me,

13:48.670 --> 13:50.537
But then a day later
she changed her mind again.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.240
So Patty or Lou or whoever you are,

13:53.241 --> 13:55.309
You are not my mother.

14:23.838 --> 14:25.572
He's not gonna wait for us?

14:25.573 --> 14:28.375
He'd be a sitting duck.

14:28.376 --> 14:30.978
Not exactly
a neutral territory, Hank.

14:30.979 --> 14:33.113
Ah, that's reassuring.

14:37.952 --> 14:40.854
Okay.
So now what?

14:40.855 --> 14:46.393
- Now... We wait for
a gentleman named amir.

14:46.394 --> 14:49.162
He takes us to dmitry.

14:49.163 --> 14:51.398
- Well, how do you know
he'll show up?

14:51.399 --> 14:53.567
He'll show up.

14:55.370 --> 14:57.170
Boris.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.576
<i>Salam aleikum.</i>

15:02.577 --> 15:05.312
- Who are you?
- You speak english?

15:05.313 --> 15:07.447
- Yes.
Who are you?

15:09.183 --> 15:11.418
We are tourists.

15:11.419 --> 15:14.221
I am amir.

15:14.222 --> 15:15.622
Follow me.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.526
This is amir.

15:23.898 --> 15:26.166
Amir?

15:26.167 --> 15:28.201
Amir.

15:28.202 --> 15:31.104
Amir, it's you?

15:31.105 --> 15:33.106
- Dima.
Dima, dima, dima, dima!

15:36.210 --> 15:38.445
Boris?

15:40.882 --> 15:44.084
I...Al...

15:44.085 --> 15:45.719
Almost killed you.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.423
- It seems you've got yourself
in quite a situation here.

15:49.424 --> 15:51.224
Yeah.

15:51.225 --> 15:53.460
The hamptons got too boring.

15:53.461 --> 15:56.530
Well, I owe you one.

15:56.531 --> 15:57.864
Yes, you do.

15:57.865 --> 16:00.534
So dima...

16:00.535 --> 16:02.536
Dr. Lawson is here.

16:02.537 --> 16:04.071
Oh!

16:04.072 --> 16:06.139
Dr. Dolittle.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.142
I'm closing my eyes now.

16:09.143 --> 16:10.310
Okay?

16:10.311 --> 16:12.012
- How long has he been like this?

16:12.013 --> 16:13.680
- He came off the boat
three days ago.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.216
He became sick soon after.

16:16.217 --> 16:17.984
Is it the diabetes?

16:17.985 --> 16:20.554
80. His glucose is fine.

16:20.555 --> 16:22.089
- I have been giving him his insulin.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.991
He's almost out.

16:24.992 --> 16:26.993
Well, I brought some more.

16:26.994 --> 16:28.962
- Well, if it's not that, then what?

16:28.963 --> 16:31.998
- Do you know where he got
these cuts and scrapes?

16:31.999 --> 16:34.434
- Yes, when we went with my dad
and my uncle

16:34.435 --> 16:37.003
To make the delivery, he fell ill.

16:37.004 --> 16:38.672
I brought him back to get better,

16:38.673 --> 16:43.410
But we couldn't always take
roads and the terrain got rough.

16:43.411 --> 16:46.012
- Uh-huh.
Deep breath in and out, dmitry.

16:46.013 --> 16:47.848
- Your father and uncle...
where are they now?

16:47.849 --> 16:49.950
- They'll come back
when it's safe for all of us.

16:49.951 --> 16:51.418
Okay.

16:51.419 --> 16:53.687
Has he been urinating?
- Very little.

16:56.491 --> 16:59.226
- He has a fever,
tachycardia and tachypnea.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.128
Without taking blood,
I can't say for sure,

17:01.129 --> 17:03.230
But if his kidneys
are starting to fail,

17:03.231 --> 17:05.031
He may be in septic shock.

17:05.031 --> 17:08.068
Can you stop it?

17:10.505 --> 17:13.740
<i>Salam aleikum.
- Alaykum as-salaam.</i>

17:25.619 --> 17:27.887
What are you doing?

17:27.888 --> 17:30.724
- I need to start
an internal jugular line.

17:30.725 --> 17:33.560
- So that you can give him drugs
to make his heart pump harder.

17:33.561 --> 17:35.061
That's right.

17:35.062 --> 17:37.964
- Is that lidocaine?
- Right again.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.004
Okay.
Good.

17:44.005 --> 17:46.573
We're inside the jugular.

17:46.574 --> 17:49.075
How do you know so much
about medicine?

17:49.076 --> 17:50.610
My uncle is a doctor.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.146
He left me in charge of
mr. Dmitry.

17:53.147 --> 17:54.714
My uncle teaches me.

17:54.715 --> 17:56.183
One day, I will be a doctor too.

17:56.184 --> 17:58.685
- How about right now?
Come here.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.021
Hold on to this, please?

18:01.022 --> 18:03.089
- You can do this
outside of a hospital?

18:03.090 --> 18:06.159
- I don't recommend it,
but I packed a lot in my bag.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.862
- It's a magic bag?
- Not necessarily.

18:08.863 --> 18:11.498
If this goes wrong,
dmitry will bleed out.

18:11.499 --> 18:14.000
Okay.
Good.

18:14.001 --> 18:17.103
Fill this with dopamine
and infuse it slowly.

18:17.104 --> 18:19.072
Too much too fast
will cause a heart attack,

18:19.073 --> 18:22.209
And I'm gonna need oxygen.

18:26.614 --> 18:30.217
Will you get me some towels?
THank you.

18:34.255 --> 18:35.622
- The boat returns for us
at high tide.

18:35.623 --> 18:37.224
We need to be on it.

18:37.225 --> 18:38.558
- Well, first we get dmitry stable,

18:38.559 --> 18:40.060
Then we'll worry about
getting out of here.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.928
- Yeah, but he's not safe here.
Neither are we.

18:41.929 --> 18:44.531
Nor is this family while
we remain... you understand?

18:58.813 --> 19:01.248
- I would be lying if I didn't
say I was a bit concerned.

19:01.249 --> 19:02.682
Oh, you should be.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.150
I've left four detailed voice mails,

19:04.151 --> 19:06.453
None of which have been returned.

19:06.454 --> 19:09.856
Jeremiah...

19:09.857 --> 19:14.494
Are we here because talia
was playing footsie with you?

19:14.495 --> 19:16.730
Because if we are, you should know

19:16.731 --> 19:19.599
That pharma reps
always flirt with the doctors.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.702
It's practically a job requirement.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.305
She's not my type.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.847
She could have narcolepsy,
a neurological disorder,

19:33.848 --> 19:35.849
Or she could, as you speculated,

19:35.850 --> 19:37.851
Be addicted to her own products.

19:37.852 --> 19:39.085
- So, you are worried
about her health?

19:39.086 --> 19:41.955
Yes. Oh.

19:50.097 --> 19:53.333
- Uh, ms. Clarke,
it's dr. Sacani.

19:58.506 --> 20:00.273
Talia, are you there?

20:00.274 --> 20:02.409
Open up.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.978
- I take it you believe
my concerns are valid?

20:08.849 --> 20:10.517
Can I help you?

20:10.518 --> 20:12.686
Talia, it's me, divya.

20:12.687 --> 20:14.454
And you remember
dr. Sacani.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.122
How do you know my name?

20:16.123 --> 20:18.858
- You met us the other day.
We're from Hankmed.

20:18.859 --> 20:21.995
You gave us a presentation.

20:21.996 --> 20:24.264
- You don't know who we are, do you?

20:25.533 --> 20:27.467
Oh, we have your computer.

20:46.921 --> 20:48.955
Well, doctor, how is he?

20:48.956 --> 20:51.524
- Amir found an oxygen tank for him,

20:51.525 --> 20:53.493
But he still has a fever.

20:53.494 --> 20:55.762
And the antibiotics aren't working.

20:55.763 --> 20:56.997
Without being able to run cultures,

20:56.998 --> 20:59.099
For all I know this could be
viral or fungal

20:59.100 --> 21:02.068
Or something else.

21:03.504 --> 21:06.740
- What could possibly
be humorous about that?

21:06.741 --> 21:09.075
- Oh... When dima and I
were younger,

21:09.076 --> 21:11.511
We used to talk to about
how we wanted to die.

21:11.512 --> 21:13.813
- Yeah. Well, I'm sure
it was nothing like this.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.849
Oh, it was exactly like this.

21:15.850 --> 21:19.019
Dying for something we believed in.

21:19.020 --> 21:21.221
Of course, we were never
the foot soldiers,

21:21.222 --> 21:26.226
Just naive and blessed with...

21:26.227 --> 21:29.129
Family wealth that kept us
out of the fight.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.697
Why did dmitry come here?

21:30.698 --> 21:34.300
- There are people fighting
for democracy here, Hank.

21:34.301 --> 21:36.736
They need financial support.

21:36.737 --> 21:40.974
- When we first got here,
you told dmitry you owed him.

21:40.975 --> 21:42.442
Yeah.

21:42.443 --> 21:44.778
Why?

21:44.779 --> 21:49.282
- Without dima, marisa would've
never gotten out of cuba.

21:49.283 --> 21:52.419
I can never fully repay him for that.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.490
Dinner is ready.

21:57.491 --> 22:00.994
Yeah,

22:14.875 --> 22:17.177
- Amir, you also went with
your uncle and father

22:17.178 --> 22:19.412
To deliver dmitry's package?

22:19.413 --> 22:20.880
Yes.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.850
What dmitry is doing to help us,

22:23.851 --> 22:28.488
To help this country...
I want to be a part of it.

22:56.050 --> 22:58.118
What did she say?

22:58.119 --> 23:00.820
- She tried to sell us goat milk
for our guests.

23:00.821 --> 23:02.689
I told her we didn't have any guests,

23:02.690 --> 23:04.891
But I do not think she believed me.

23:04.892 --> 23:07.026
- Will she stay quiet?
- I don't know.

23:07.027 --> 23:09.529
- His central venous pressure's
bottoming out.

23:09.530 --> 23:12.966
He needs fluids wide open.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.167
Dima?

23:17.972 --> 23:20.940
- Dmitry, did you eat any shellfish?

23:20.941 --> 23:23.409
With your hemochromatosis,
you know you can't...

23:23.410 --> 23:25.044
- I know.
You told me, it can kill me.

23:25.045 --> 23:26.813
- Amir, have you given him
any shellfish?

23:26.814 --> 23:28.148
Even in a broth.

23:28.149 --> 23:30.216
No, we don't eat shellfish.

23:32.720 --> 23:37.157
- Dmitry, did you arrive
like we did by boat?

23:37.158 --> 23:38.625
Yeah.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.827
- And did you jump out
and swim to shore?

23:40.828 --> 23:42.595
- Why?
- It's an infection,

23:42.596 --> 23:45.064
And the antibiotic I gave you
won't treat it.

23:47.368 --> 23:48.701
Dima.

23:48.702 --> 23:51.671
- Doctor?
- Yes?

23:51.672 --> 23:54.340
Is it too late?

23:54.341 --> 23:56.276
I hope not.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.577
- No bumps, bruises, or signs of
head injury of any kind.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.413
- Why else would I sleep
for two days?

24:09.414 --> 24:11.783
- Are you addicted to your drugs?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.684
Are you kidding?

24:13.685 --> 24:17.121
I know way too much about drugs.
They scare me.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.824
- Will you look over
my shoulder, please?

24:19.825 --> 24:21.292
That's it.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.362
How about your vision...
any trouble?

24:24.363 --> 24:25.963
No.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.665
Yes.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.034
My eyesight got blurry
a couple of days ago.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.670
I stepped in front of a moving car.

24:32.671 --> 24:38.442
I thought it happened because
it was hot and I was overtired.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.145
And last month
when I was in riverhead,

24:41.146 --> 24:43.581
I missed a sales seminar
because I had overslept...

24:43.582 --> 24:45.716
An entire Monday.

24:45.717 --> 24:47.685
- Talia, you're around doctors
all the time.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.153
Did you consult any of them?

24:49.154 --> 24:51.422
- I'm supposed to be
the one healthy person

24:51.423 --> 24:53.157
The doctor sees all day.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.892
I'm not gonna jeopardize that.

24:54.893 --> 24:59.864
Look, I don't wanna go back
to hawking cars or real estate

24:59.865 --> 25:02.533
Or selling meat door-to-door.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.535
You have to help me.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.270
And we will help you.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.707
I think our first step should be

25:09.708 --> 25:11.509
A trip to the hospital for a head ct.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.611
- Yes, and once we rule out
a head injury,

25:13.612 --> 25:15.847
I think we need blood work
and a sleep study.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.949
I'd like to rule out hypothyroidism.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.651
Ms. Clarke?

25:20.652 --> 25:22.186
Talia.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.989
She's asleep again.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.258
Okay.
What do you think it could be?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.760
Maybe kleine-levin?

25:29.761 --> 25:31.629
Sleeping beauty syndrome?

25:31.630 --> 25:34.232
- It's rare, I know,
but the symptoms line up.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.800
Unfortunately,
the only way to diagnose it

25:35.801 --> 25:40.404
Is by exclusion, and there's no cure.

25:44.810 --> 25:49.881
- Your oxygenation is
adequate now for travel.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.382
That's fantastic.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.784
What made me so ill?

25:53.785 --> 25:55.686
Vibrio vulnificus.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.088
Hank, english.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.956
- It's a marine bacteria
that can enter the body

25:58.957 --> 26:03.561
Through open wounds like
diabetic insulin injection sites

26:03.562 --> 26:06.197
When swimming in waters
with shellfish.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.732
It thrives
in iron-rich environments

26:07.733 --> 26:10.701
Like in people
who have hemochromatosis.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.536
Mm-hmm.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.874
99.3.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.543
Your fever's finally broken.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.712
Why do you look so worried?

26:21.713 --> 26:24.282
- Amir. He went to the beach to
check on the boat a while ago.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.483
He should've been back by now.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.085
Ah, buh, buh.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.888
You look better.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.157
- I will feel much better
when we are gone.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.492
Your drink.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.160
THank you.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.064
Listen, boris,

26:40.065 --> 26:44.669
Coming here, not telling you
about it, I...

26:44.670 --> 26:46.170
Oh.

26:46.171 --> 26:48.940
I may have...

26:48.941 --> 26:50.741
I'm sorry, you may...

26:50.742 --> 26:53.744
I may have...

26:53.745 --> 26:56.714
- You may have made...
- Why are you always pushing?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.618
Fine, I made a mistake.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.053
- Mistake.
- Is that clear?

27:02.054 --> 27:03.321
Mistake.
- Oh, yes. I got it.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.656
- Happy?
- I'm thrilled.

27:05.657 --> 27:06.657
Yes.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.130
- THank you very much
for everything, both of you.

27:13.131 --> 27:17.034
I will never forget it.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.942
- What?
Where's your brother?

27:24.943 --> 27:26.110
He's on the beach.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.012
- Okay.
- We go now.

27:28.013 --> 27:29.613
Here we go.

27:31.883 --> 27:35.119
Okay. What's he yelling about?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.021
He would like us to hurry.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.622
Believe me, he's not alone.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.525
Easy, dmitry.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.296
Bravo.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.399
- Good-bye, amir.
- Good-bye, Hank.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.667
- Hey, what's wrong with your leg?

27:49.668 --> 27:50.968
- Nothing.
Go.

27:50.969 --> 27:53.204
- It's painful for you to walk,
isn't it?

27:53.205 --> 27:55.139
That's why you sent your sister
to run and get us.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.674
We need to leave, Hank.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.843
Amir, show me your leg now.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.212
Come on, Hank.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.384
How long have you had this?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.486
- I got scratched up
when we fled the mountains,

28:08.487 --> 28:10.421
But it didn't look this way before.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.224
It was barely a cut.
- Hank, he's a smart boy.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.792
Just give him the medicine.
Let's go.

28:14.793 --> 28:16.260
No, you don't understand.

28:16.261 --> 28:17.628
If I don't address
this wound quickly,

28:17.629 --> 28:18.863
The infection will spread.
He could...

28:18.864 --> 28:20.131
- Let us take the boy
to the yacht, yeah?

28:20.132 --> 28:21.599
You can take treat him there,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.267
And then we'll bring him back
at low tide, yes?

28:23.268 --> 28:24.835
- No, I will not leave my family.

28:24.836 --> 28:25.936
Hank, go!

28:31.243 --> 28:34.545
Get inside the boat, doctor.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.715
- Dima.
- No.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.318
I'm not dying here, boris.

28:41.319 --> 28:44.288
Get inside the boat...

28:44.289 --> 28:46.257
now.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.128
Hank.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.634
Come here.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.529
THank you, sabeen.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.532
- All right.
So amir,

29:28.533 --> 29:30.467
I'm gonna use
some cool, sterilized water

29:30.468 --> 29:32.636
To clean the wound.

29:38.176 --> 29:41.779
It's badly infected, isn't it?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.715
- I'm afraid you have
flesh-eating bacteria.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.350
From a scrape?

29:46.351 --> 29:49.720
- The bacteria can leave a toxin
that will eat through muscle.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.588
Will I lose my leg?

29:51.589 --> 29:53.857
Not if I can help it.

29:53.858 --> 29:55.592
Come here.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.603
Okay.

30:06.604 --> 30:09.373
Amir, first I have to
clean the wound.

30:14.012 --> 30:17.614
Now I'm gonna numb it.

30:17.615 --> 30:20.284
Okay.
You're gonna feel a few pinches.

30:23.788 --> 30:27.157
- Yaqub is taking dmitry
back to the yacht.

30:27.158 --> 30:30.160
He'll return for us when he can.

30:30.161 --> 30:33.130
So how will I help?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.138
- Okay.
Wherever you see bleeding,

30:41.139 --> 30:43.073
I want you to use this
to cauterize it.

30:43.074 --> 30:44.508
Yeah.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.443
Okay.

30:46.444 --> 30:49.079
Amir, I'm gonna make
the incision now.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.014
Just follow my blade.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.953
That's it.
Get right in there.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.623
Doing great.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.793
Wherever it comes pouring out, okay?

31:02.794 --> 31:06.029
Good. Good.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.264
Okay.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.669
Just spreading the flesh.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.776
Yup.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.879
That's good.

31:23.314 --> 31:26.383
Now I'm gonna start removing
the infected tissue.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.593
There's a lot.

31:39.697 --> 31:41.565
- You can't get it all, can you?

31:41.566 --> 31:43.033
- No, look, if we were in a hospital

31:43.034 --> 31:44.635
I could control the bleeding
well enough

31:44.636 --> 31:47.337
To get every last bit of
infected tissue, but here...

31:47.338 --> 31:48.672
Here, what can you do?

31:51.976 --> 31:54.811
Where do you keep your trash?

32:03.721 --> 32:05.889
You shouldn't be here.

32:05.890 --> 32:08.825
- There's something
I didn't tell you.

32:16.534 --> 32:18.936
Something you need to know.

32:21.105 --> 32:26.176
The story that your parents
told you is the truth.

32:26.177 --> 32:28.679
After I gave birth,

32:28.680 --> 32:31.348
I did change my mind.

32:31.349 --> 32:33.750
I held my daughter.

32:33.751 --> 32:37.454
I'm sorry that I did that to you.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.724
I shouldn't have lied
to you and Evan.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.559
I should have told you the truth,

32:42.560 --> 32:45.762
But I just couldn't.

32:45.763 --> 32:50.167
- She said it wasn't about
wanting to deceive anyone,

32:50.168 --> 32:54.171
It was about blocking out
a painful memory,

32:54.172 --> 32:56.840
That same memory that made her make

32:56.841 --> 32:59.610
All kinds of bad decisions later.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.979
- Most of which you found out about?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.614
Mm-hmm.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.316
She said she was punishing herself

33:06.317 --> 33:09.653
Because she didn't know
how to forgive herself.

33:11.923 --> 33:14.358
But I just...

33:14.359 --> 33:19.096
I don't know what to believe
about Lou anymore.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.131
- Well, you need to know the truth.

33:21.132 --> 33:24.401
You need to know if she's
your mother or not, right?

33:24.402 --> 33:28.238
I know one way we can find out.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.476
Um... Yeah.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.945
This will work.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.417
THank you.

33:40.418 --> 33:42.019
Okay.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.125
This is safe, Hank?

33:48.126 --> 33:50.127
- Maggots will only eat dead flesh.

33:50.128 --> 33:51.628
Cool, huh?

33:56.434 --> 33:57.934
THank you.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.376
And...

34:06.377 --> 34:08.712
That should do it.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.647
In a couple of days
after they're done eating,

34:10.648 --> 34:12.149
They'll die.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.884
You'll need to clean
and re-wrap the wound.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.452
I'll leave you with some antibiotics

34:15.453 --> 34:19.056
Which you'll take twice a day
for the next ten days.

34:19.056 --> 34:22.926
Actually...

34:22.927 --> 34:25.862
I'm just going to leave you
the whole bag.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.699
But it's your magic bag.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.967
Now it's your magic bag.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.911
- Please tell me
that you have good news.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.380
I've been up all night

34:43.380 --> 34:44.947
Trying to find an explanation
for talia's symptoms.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.384
- And if every explanation led
to a diagnosis of kleine-levin,

34:47.385 --> 34:49.553
You would not be alone.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.987
Now I understand why you don't
look very happy.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.725
- Talia's other tests
all came back negative

34:54.726 --> 34:56.259
From the blood work to the ct.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.062
Even the preliminary sleep lab
results look normal.

34:59.063 --> 35:01.164
- Talia suddenly looks very happy.

35:03.034 --> 35:05.368
You haven't told her yet, have you?

35:08.272 --> 35:10.707
If she does have kleine-levin,

35:10.708 --> 35:12.175
And this episode is clearly over,

35:12.176 --> 35:14.277
All of her symptoms
have been relieved.

35:14.278 --> 35:17.547
- Yes, but they can come back
at any time.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.750
Will you tell her with me?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.020
Of course.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.229
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.531
I feel so much better.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.200
- There is something
that we should...

35:39.103 --> 35:41.838
Dr. Sacani.

35:41.839 --> 35:44.708
Jeremiah, jeremiah, I was...
I was telling talia...

35:44.709 --> 35:47.277
- How long have you had those
on your legs?

35:47.278 --> 35:48.779
- What, these bruises?
I don't know.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.680
Five or six weeks.

35:52.049 --> 35:54.951
- They're not bruises.
- Erythema nodosum.

35:54.952 --> 35:56.419
It's an inflammatory disorder

35:56.420 --> 35:57.621
That causes red bumps under the skin.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.056
- Which can be caused by sarcoidosis.

36:00.057 --> 36:01.792
Which can cause granulomas.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.727
- And a granuloma
near the hypothalamus

36:03.728 --> 36:05.996
Can cause kleine-levin.
- Yes.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.831
- And hip bone's connected
to the leg bone.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.766
Where is this headed?

36:09.767 --> 36:11.868
- We believe that your symptoms
may be caused

36:11.869 --> 36:14.638
By a lesion on your brain.
It's called kleine-levin.

36:14.639 --> 36:17.507
- Okay. It's never good
when they have two names.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.609
- It's also known
as sleeping beauty syndrome.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.945
It's what made you sleep
for two days.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.280
- Yes. And an
mri with gadolinium contrast

36:23.281 --> 36:25.348
Can confirm this diagnosis.
- But the good news is

36:25.349 --> 36:27.083
You have the only type
of the syndrome

36:27.084 --> 36:28.952
That is treatable with steroids.
- Steroids.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.654
Good. We make those.

36:30.655 --> 36:35.125
Just tell me, am I going to be...

36:35.126 --> 36:38.028
- Yes. Um...
You'll be fine.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.430
- Great.
Say no more.

36:40.431 --> 36:43.466
Seriously.

36:43.467 --> 36:46.336
- So there will be a plane
waiting to take you home.

36:47.805 --> 36:49.806
You're not coming with me?

36:49.807 --> 36:53.210
- No.
I'll stay with dmitry.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.679
Make sure he's in able hands.

36:55.680 --> 36:59.282
You're a good friend.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.484
I'm glad I got to see it.

37:01.485 --> 37:05.388
- May I assume then that we are
not done with one another?

37:05.389 --> 37:06.890
You may.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.659
I'm glad of that.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.228
Me too.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.029
But let's never do this again.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.664
- No.
Ah.

37:14.665 --> 37:17.234
Well, if you think this is bad,

37:17.235 --> 37:19.636
You should have been in turkmenistan.

37:19.637 --> 37:21.638
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:21.639 --> 37:25.008
Compared with turkmenistan,
it's like summer camp.

37:25.009 --> 37:26.743
You went to summer camp?

37:26.744 --> 37:29.179
Gstaad, alpenschule.

37:29.180 --> 37:32.749
Passaic, ymca.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.852
I was sent to camp so that my
parents could argue in private.

37:35.853 --> 37:38.655
When my father fell ill.
- Passaic, ymca.

37:42.026 --> 37:44.661
I hated camp.

37:44.662 --> 37:47.230
Me also.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.673
Oh, thanks for the update.

37:56.674 --> 37:58.408
Good-bye.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.078
Everything okay?

38:01.079 --> 38:03.046
That was talia.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.949
Mri confirmed the granuloma
and she's been given prednisone,

38:05.950 --> 38:07.384
But there's a problem.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.786
She feels so good
that she wants to come over

38:09.787 --> 38:11.455
And finish her presentation.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.524
What did you say?

38:13.525 --> 38:15.225
- I said to wait till tomorrow
when Hank is here,

38:15.226 --> 38:17.127
Because I'm sure he wouldn't
want to miss it.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.129
Smart.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.564
Very smart.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.132
Remind me not to be here, all right?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.500
Well, I won't be here,

38:23.501 --> 38:26.436
So I'm not sure
I'll be able to do that.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.776
You know what, dr. Sacani?

38:32.777 --> 38:35.179
When you first started at Hankmed,

38:35.180 --> 38:37.681
I did not think that you
would last the first week.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.249
Hmm.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.851
You were not alone in that feeling.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.653
I'm glad that you did.

38:42.654 --> 38:46.423
You bring such a different
perspective to Hankmed.

38:46.424 --> 38:51.128
You totally won me over,
dr. Jeremiah sacani.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.598
Rafa.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.700
Hey, Rafa.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.736
Rafa, Rafa!

38:59.737 --> 39:01.205
Not totally.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.017
Surprise.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.586
I hate surprises.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.821
- Oh, cool.
Well, I'll be going.

39:17.822 --> 39:19.423
No, not so fast.

39:19.424 --> 39:22.593
Hey, you got some sun.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.428
I like it.
- Yeah?

39:24.429 --> 39:28.065
- Were really working or just
going to the beach without me?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.033
I was really working.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.236
Although, there was beach.
Not a good beach.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.837
I missed you.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.739
I missed you too.

39:37.842 --> 39:39.576
You know, they say the sign
of a healthy couple is...

39:39.577 --> 39:41.979
Shut up and kiss me already.

39:52.857 --> 39:54.625
- THank you for agreeing
to the dna test.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.226
Of course.

39:56.227 --> 40:00.163
This way there won't be any
doubts about the results.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.932
When do we get the results?

40:01.933 --> 40:04.268
- They'll be ready in three days.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.436
- Well, I'll stick around
the hamptons until then.

40:06.437 --> 40:08.872
Oh, really?

40:08.873 --> 40:10.874
- Yes.
If there's a match,

40:10.875 --> 40:12.609
I'd like to be close

40:12.610 --> 40:15.746
In case you want to see me again.

40:19.317 --> 40:20.684
You know what, Lou?

40:20.685 --> 40:22.286
I've got some patients to see

40:22.287 --> 40:24.988
Before I drop off both of
your samples to the lab.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.823
How about I walk you to the truck?

40:26.824 --> 40:31.328
Great.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.897
Well, good-bye, Evan.
- Nice to see you again.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.501
Paige.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.305
THank you.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.106
Bye.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.508
Bye.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.115
Are you okay?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.084
Mm-hmm.

40:54.085 --> 40:58.722
Good or bad, I just...
I need the truth.

40:58.723 --> 41:02.192
I need to know if she is my mother.

41:03.861 --> 41:06.496
- Right.
Come on.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.532
Where are we going?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.701
We're going out to lunch

41:10.702 --> 41:12.803
Then the beach then to dinner
then the movies.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.006
These three days are going to fly.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.219
Stanley?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.521
Hey, what are you doing here?

41:31.522 --> 41:34.091
Hello, Hank.

41:35.693 --> 41:38.161
- I thought you were staying
with dmitry.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.363
- Yeah.
I didn't like the way

41:39.364 --> 41:41.365
Dmitry's treatment was being handled,

41:41.366 --> 41:45.635
So... I decided he should
stay here with me.

41:45.636 --> 41:47.871
- That explains why his dog is here.

41:47.872 --> 41:51.875
- Yeah, stanley,
the little blood sugar k9.

41:51.876 --> 41:56.613
So can you treat a man who has
pulled a gun on you, Hank?

41:56.614 --> 41:58.181
I can treat him.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.550
Just don't ask me to trust him.

42:00.551 --> 42:02.352
Yeah.

42:02.353 --> 42:07.224
I know dima far too well to ask
that of either one of us.

42:09.225 --> 42:11.225
"By moideen"
