Ah, this hunting trip
is long overdue.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.807
Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad
that all the-the animals

00:41.809 --> 00:43.542
are so spread out, you know?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.511
I mean, wouldn't it
be awesome if-if they were all

00:45.513 --> 00:47.046
grouped together,
like in a cafeteria,

00:47.048 --> 00:49.181
and you could just go in there
with a trench coat

00:49.183 --> 00:50.416
and just waste them?

00:50.418 --> 00:53.152
Well, maybe I can stir up
some quail or pheasant

00:53.154 --> 00:55.387
with my patented
bird calls.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.089
Birds! Quail! Pheasant!

00:57.091 --> 00:58.724
Come on out!

00:58.726 --> 01:02.594
I'm a bird of the opposite sex
who's interested in mating!

01:02.596 --> 01:04.396
(gasps)
Did you hear that?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.697
We're gonna get laid!

01:05.699 --> 01:07.533
Billy, Billy, come on.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.401
Don't be stupid.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.248
Should've taken
the shot, fat-ass.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.783
Ah, ah, ow!

01:24.785 --> 01:27.753
(whimpering)

01:29.189 --> 01:31.457
Hey, Peter, you got
your safety on, right?

01:31.459 --> 01:32.791
Yeah, of course.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.460
Okay, 'cause your gun is
pointing right at me.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.594
Well, you want me
to pull the trigger

01:35.596 --> 01:36.962
and prove it to you?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.864
No, I just want to make
sure your safety's on.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.032
(trigger clicks)
There. See, Quagmire?

01:40.034 --> 01:41.100
Safety's on.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.102
Now this is a gun
without a safety.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.303
(screams)

01:44.305 --> 01:45.471
Quite the difference, huh?

01:45.473 --> 01:46.939
Damn it, Peter,
you son of a bitch!

01:46.941 --> 01:47.940
You shot me!

01:47.942 --> 01:49.241
Oh, my God, Peter!

01:49.243 --> 01:51.143
That might be the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.778
No, the dumbest
thing I ever did

01:52.780 --> 01:54.780
was open that
can of whup-ass.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.418
(grunting)

01:59.420 --> 02:01.253
Lois, why did you buy this?!

02:01.255 --> 02:03.722
LOIS:
It was on sale!

02:07.460 --> 02:11.263
A writer who inherits
a magic typewriter

02:11.265 --> 02:13.599
that writes for him,

02:13.601 --> 02:17.569
but then it turns out
the typewriter is... racist?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.438
Totally makes sense.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.440
Older technology,
older world view.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.442
And that is a good day.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.110
I earned some banana bread.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.845
(phone ringing)

02:26.847 --> 02:27.846
Oh, crap.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.847
It's Dylan.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.649
Dylan? Your son?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.784
I haven't heard you
mention him in ages.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.088
Yeah, I-I decided to step away
from the whole situation.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.290
The last thing he needs
is a father who's,

02:38.292 --> 02:40.359
you know, sometimes
there, sometimes not.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.928
Really? When-when was the part
when you were there?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.296
Hey, if I
click "ignore,"

02:44.298 --> 02:46.131
will he know that I'm
sending him to voice mail?

02:46.133 --> 02:47.166
Hey, Dylan!

02:47.168 --> 02:48.534
Hey, it's Stewie!

02:48.536 --> 02:50.702
Yeah, I'm right here
with your dad!

02:51.838 --> 02:53.805
Hey... hey, Dylan.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.873
Hey, Dad!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.275
I know we haven't
talked in a while,

02:56.277 --> 02:58.677
but I'm calling because
I'm on my way to Quahog.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.978
Oh, really?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.547
W-When are you
getting here?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.848
Tuesday...
Oh, don't
say Tuesday!

03:02.850 --> 03:05.050
Aw, aw, I'm at the...
I'm at the...

03:05.052 --> 03:06.885
I'm out at
the project all day.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.887
Aw, hands on,
indispensable.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.456
They-they need me there,
so, wow.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.058
Rats. Bummer.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.460
I can cover for you
at the project, Brian!

03:15.462 --> 03:16.628
Go see your boy!

03:16.630 --> 03:17.829
DYLAN:
Dad, who's your coworker?

03:17.831 --> 03:18.797
He sounds nice.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.332
He's widely disliked
here, but, uh...

03:20.334 --> 03:21.967
I'll meet you Tuesday
at the coffee shop.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.802
Sounds great.
I'll see you then.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.871
Okay, b-bye.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.539
See? Don't you feel better?

03:27.541 --> 03:28.874
You're gonna go
to that lunch,

03:28.876 --> 03:30.342
you're gonna reconnect
with your son.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.343
It'll be great.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.744
I don't know, Stewie.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.246
Trust me, you should
take my advice.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.215
I mean, I'm the guy
who told Michael Chiklis

03:36.217 --> 03:37.749
to wear tight shirts.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.351
I'll tell you
anything you want,

03:39.353 --> 03:40.919
just get your boobs
out of my face!

03:40.921 --> 03:43.655
You know the difference
between you and me, dirtbag?

03:43.657 --> 03:47.659
No matter how muscular I get,
I will never be muscular.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.599
Hey, Quagmire,
what's with the cast?

03:53.601 --> 03:56.235
Did you hurt your arm after
I shot you in the arm?

03:56.237 --> 03:58.103
The shooting was
the injury, Peter!

03:58.105 --> 04:00.672
Look, I already said I was
sorry, like, a hundred times.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.108
Oh, and before I forget,
I want my Huey Lewis CD back.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.443
Well, I want a new drug.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.844
Okay, at least
you've been using it.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.012
But I want
it back, Peter.

04:07.014 --> 04:07.913
This is it.
Ooh-ah.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.248
Damn it, Peter,
just give it back.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.550
I can't give it back.
I lost it in a poker game.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.385
What?
I didn't think
he could beat a two.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.720
Where the hell
do you get off

04:14.722 --> 04:16.421
betting my CD
in a poker game?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.923
I don't think
I like your tone.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.026
W-What? You're-you're saying
I'm being the unreasonable one?!

04:21.028 --> 04:22.427
Geez, calm down,
you guys.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.729
No, no, Joe, Joe, Joe,

04:23.731 --> 04:25.197
it's time somebody
said this to him.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.633
Peter Griffin,
you are an idiot!

04:27.635 --> 04:30.435
You can't even walk
and chew gum at the same time.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.404
Peter, come on!

04:32.406 --> 04:33.472
Walk over here.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.606
(chewing)

04:34.608 --> 04:35.907
I'm doing something.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.143
One thing at a time.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.311
Damn it, Peter, that's it!

04:39.313 --> 04:41.146
I am done!
I'm done with you!

04:41.148 --> 04:42.447
I'm done with
all your crap!

04:42.449 --> 04:43.915
I never want to
speak to you again!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.584
This friendship is over!

04:45.586 --> 04:46.585
Well, fine!

04:46.587 --> 04:47.719
I don't need your friendship!

04:47.721 --> 04:48.987
I got other friends.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.956
I got my silent movie friends.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.958
(tinny piano music playing)

05:17.183 --> 05:19.284
Coming up, we'll meet
a Filipino man

05:19.286 --> 05:21.453
who actually has
a grown-up haircut.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.121
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

05:23.123 --> 05:25.023
Aren't you supposed to be
having lunch with Dylan?

05:25.025 --> 05:27.192
Yeah, you know, Stewie,
I've been thinking about it.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.127
And I haven't seen
him in years,

05:29.129 --> 05:31.330
and at this point,
I-I just don't see

05:31.332 --> 05:32.764
what could possibly
be gained

05:32.766 --> 05:34.132
from me getting
together with him.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.835
In entertainment news,
Hollywood comes to Quahog

05:36.837 --> 05:38.804
in the form of a new
Disney Channel show

05:38.806 --> 05:40.539
called <i>Parent Boppers,</i>

05:40.541 --> 05:42.307
about a group of
teen detectives.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.776
The show, set and filmed
right here in Rhode Island,

05:44.778 --> 05:48.680
stars local teen and
Irish trash Dylan Flannigan.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.048
Brian, did you hear that?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.384
Your son's gonna be a TV star!

05:52.386 --> 05:54.119
Brian?

05:54.121 --> 05:56.188
(engine revs, tires squeal)

05:57.223 --> 05:58.690
He's off to lunch, Meg.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.892
Oh, that dog o' mine!

06:00.894 --> 06:02.394
That's Mike Drunkbeater.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.562
Look it up on the Internet.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.731
(man singing):

06:15.308 --> 06:18.877
Wow, my son Dylan
on a TV show.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.012
Funny how life
turns out, isn't it?

06:21.014 --> 06:23.181
You remember that weekend
we watched TV together?

06:23.183 --> 06:26.852
Boy, little did I know
how much that was gonna rub off.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.320
Did we watch
TV together?

06:28.322 --> 06:30.489
Oh, probably.
But, wow, huh?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.990
And-and you know what's weird?

06:31.992 --> 06:34.426
You're on a show...
I'm a writer.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.728
It's-it's almost like
the universe is trying to...

06:36.730 --> 06:38.330
(chuckling):
...I don't know,

06:38.332 --> 06:40.332
make us work together
or something, I don't know.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.934
You... you want
a job on my show?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.736
Hey, hey, don't put
the universe's words

06:44.738 --> 06:45.937
in my mouth, okay?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.439
I don't know, Dad.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.408
I've-I've barely seen you
in the past few years.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.376
So, what better way
to reconnect

06:51.378 --> 06:53.044
than by working
together every day?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.513
Well, I suppose
I could talk to them,

06:54.515 --> 06:55.680
see if they'd
go for it.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.681
Why wouldn't they?

06:56.683 --> 06:58.016
I-I mean,
it wouldn't be

06:58.018 --> 06:59.851
the craziest idea
in show business.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.752
When I grow up,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.721
I want to stick my head
through a circle

07:02.723 --> 07:04.589
at the beginning
of movies and roar.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.691
(laughter)

07:06.693 --> 07:09.795
What's up now, bitches?!

07:13.032 --> 07:15.634
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>

07:15.636 --> 07:17.402
brought to you without
commercial interruption

07:17.404 --> 07:18.770
by Mazda.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.539
(men grunting,
gunfire in distance)

07:25.812 --> 07:29.848
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.718
(whispering):
Zoom zoom.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.326
Hey, Jerome, can you
clear out my booth?

07:41.328 --> 07:43.662
Looks like somebody
left their trash here.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.931
Jerome, can you tell
that (bleep) (bleep) (bleep)

07:45.933 --> 07:47.332
to (bleep) get
the hell out of here

07:47.334 --> 07:48.967
before I (bleep)
kick him in the face?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.503
Peter, why don't you just sit
in that booth over there?

07:51.505 --> 07:54.172
Oh, man, that's where the
after-work secretaries sit.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.843
What about Mr. Demerson?
Is he single?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.511
I... I-I don't know.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.179
What about Mr. Adelaide?
Is he single?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.747
I don't know
who that is.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.616
Well, who do you know
who is single?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.618
Uh, I'm assuming you.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.353
Oh-oh, hey, look! Cake!

08:11.090 --> 08:13.258
Hey, Joe!
Hey, Joe, I'm over here!

08:13.260 --> 08:14.359
Joe! Joe!
Come sit with me!

08:14.361 --> 08:15.961
Come on, you guys.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.696
Joe, I got a box of
salt water taffies,

08:17.698 --> 08:18.864
and you can have two.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.965
Joe, I got
a deck of cards

08:19.967 --> 08:21.299
you can put in your
wheels to look cool.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.468
Joe, I'll do the wavy
stomach for you.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.537
(chuckles)
Looks like a real wave.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.439
Joe, I can scream
your name real loud!

08:27.441 --> 08:29.975
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

08:29.977 --> 08:31.042
I can yell it louder!

08:31.044 --> 08:33.545
Joe! Joe! Joe!

08:33.547 --> 08:37.015
Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe! Joe!

08:37.017 --> 08:39.017
What the hell
is going on here?!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.719
I'm in there trying
to take a leak!

08:40.721 --> 08:42.320
What, you think
I'm here to amuse you?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.523
You made me dribble
on my Bruno Maglis

08:44.525 --> 08:46.558
turning to see
who's calling my name!

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
Joe Pesci thought we were
talking to him

08:48.562 --> 08:50.228
'cause his name is Joe.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.131
Oh, you don't know who
Joe Pesci is, 'cause you're 14.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.868
You see, in the '90s,
this was a tough guy.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.576
Hey, multiracial
group of friends,

09:04.578 --> 09:06.011
you want to hang out?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.679
Cut! That's a five.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.915
Tell my assistant I fell asleep
with a condom on again,

09:09.917 --> 09:11.917
and to bring scissors
to my trailer.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.187
All right, guys,
before we begin today,

09:16.189 --> 09:19.324
I want to introduce our newest
staff writer, Brian Griffin.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.358
Hi, guys.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.093
Yes, I am that Brian Griffin.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.230
You probably have my novel,
but just so you know, in here,

09:25.232 --> 09:27.432
I'm just one of
the guys, all right?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.401
You have my novel, right?

09:29.403 --> 09:30.602
Nope? No?

09:30.604 --> 09:32.237
You got it, though.
Nope?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.271
You got it?

09:33.273 --> 09:35.106
Nope, nobody's got it.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.441
All right.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.243
Okay, so we got to
come up with a story

09:38.245 --> 09:39.344
for next week's episode.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.545
How about we do one

09:40.547 --> 09:41.947
where DJ gets his
driver's license?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.682
That could work.
I don't think
we've done that.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.683
Love that idea.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.784
No, no, no.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.953
Guys, guys, come on,
where's the STWISTUSION?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.755
Really?
Really?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.390
I'm the only guy here
who's heard of that?

09:52.392 --> 09:55.427
Stakes, twists, conclusion--
STWISTUSION.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.062
That sounds made up.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.230
Let me ask you something:
are you afraid right now?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.465
What? No.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.700
That's what's wrong.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.401
You should be, you know?

10:03.403 --> 10:04.636
Art is scary.

10:04.638 --> 10:05.737
This is writing, man.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.105
The viewer wants to be raped.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.874
Are you saying my nine-year-old
daughter wants to be raped?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.910
Now you're asking
the right questions.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.813
Now you're being creative,
thinking outside the box.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.616
Take what you think you know
and go a different way with it.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.151
Like-like, for instance,
what if the daughter in <i>Taken</i>

10:20.153 --> 10:22.287
was Zooey Deschanel?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.623
Send me her head.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.328
Peter, Quagmire, I've
called you here today

10:30.330 --> 10:32.130
because this
has got to stop.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.332
The petty vying
for my attention,

10:34.334 --> 10:37.435
the late-night phone
calls, the attack ads.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.337
NARRATOR:
<i>Glenn Quagmire claims to be</i>

10:39.339 --> 10:40.805
<i>Joe Swanson's good friend.</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:44.175
<i>But would a "good friend"</i>
<i>not return a leaf blower</i>

10:44.177 --> 10:47.078
<i>for four months</i>
<i>during the leafy season?</i>

10:47.080 --> 10:48.313
I'm Peter Griffin,

10:48.315 --> 10:50.515
and I broke into a news station
to make this.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.950
MAN:
Hey, who's that guy?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.284
(gasps)

10:53.286 --> 10:54.686
(static crackling)

10:54.688 --> 10:57.856
Well, look, you guys have
given me no alternative.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.491
I have to choose
one of you.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.525
So I choose Quagmire.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.127
What?!
Suck it!

11:02.129 --> 11:03.361
I'm sorry, Peter,

11:03.363 --> 11:04.829
it's just that
Quagmire's been there

11:04.831 --> 11:06.498
for me in some
pretty dark days.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.933
And he's been a wonderful
godfather to Susie.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.035
(girl giggles)

11:10.037 --> 11:11.770
There she is,
my little Susie-woozie!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.338
(both laugh)

11:13.340 --> 11:15.974
I love Susie more!
Come here, Susie!

11:15.976 --> 11:18.476
Uncle Peter's gonna
give you a raspberry.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.478
(blows raspberry)

11:20.480 --> 11:23.648
Peter, that's not
where you do a raspberry.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.017
I closed my eyes too early.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.986
I think it's best
if you leave.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.220
Oh, yeah?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.523
Well, maybe I'll hang out
with my godson, Kevin.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.158
KEVIN:
Get out!

11:33.160 --> 11:35.360
He was masturbating
with a knife.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.132
We're rolling!

11:41.134 --> 11:44.335
My stupid parents want me
to wear a bike helmet.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.970
Parents are lame.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.006
Hold on, other kids.
Maybe they just recognize

11:48.008 --> 11:50.241
that nothing can protect us
from the tedium

11:50.243 --> 11:51.676
of our mundane lives.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.179
Aren't we all on bikes
without helmets?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.915
Sometimes I just want
to put this gun in my mouth.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.051
Cut! Your line is
"That's right, Cameron."

12:00.053 --> 12:02.053
I know. My dad wrote
that one for me.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.354
Again with this?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.923
Yesterday, you had
Dakota give herself

12:04.925 --> 12:07.826
an abdomen-punch abortion during
her volleyball tournament.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.761
Hey, seventh grade
can be hell.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.929
Brian, you're fired.

12:10.931 --> 12:11.930
Wait, what?!

12:11.932 --> 12:13.498
Sorry, Brian,
but you're done.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.367
Oh, come on! You can't fire a
writer in the middle of a show!

12:16.369 --> 12:17.869
That would be like
a doctor leaving

12:17.871 --> 12:19.104
in the middle
of a surgery!

12:19.106 --> 12:20.371
(monitor beeping steadily)

12:20.373 --> 12:21.773
Help!

12:21.775 --> 12:24.342
I'm supposed to have surgery,
but my doctor disappeared.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.746
Okay, Josh, this is the shot
you've been waiting for.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.183
Okay, Derek,
this is the shot

12:32.185 --> 12:34.018
you've been waiting for.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.255
Dylan, Dylan,
there you are!

12:37.257 --> 12:38.790
Listen, you can't
let them fire me!

12:38.792 --> 12:40.225
You're the star
of the show!

12:40.227 --> 12:42.761
Dad, believe me, I want
you to work here with me,

12:42.763 --> 12:44.462
but you can't keep
doing things like that.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.930
And they know
you took those cases

12:45.932 --> 12:47.365
of Diet Coke
home last night.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.067
I thought they were
anybody's Diet Coke!

12:49.069 --> 12:50.568
They're for work!
I work at home!

12:50.570 --> 12:52.771
Oh, hey, by the way, are we all
getting those backpacks

12:52.773 --> 12:54.439
with the name
of the show on them?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.774
You know what, Dad?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.408
I'm starting to think
that you've just been

12:57.410 --> 12:59.477
using me to advance
your career!

12:59.479 --> 13:01.813
God! You're
a terrible father!

13:01.815 --> 13:03.982
I never want to
see you again!

13:05.451 --> 13:06.618
(sighs)

13:06.620 --> 13:07.886
My God, he's right.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.156
I  <i>am</i>a terrible father.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.045
(backup alarm beeps)

13:55.367 --> 13:57.302
Brian, do you
know where...

13:57.304 --> 13:59.204
What the hell
are you drinking?

13:59.206 --> 14:01.206
Is that Rite Aid-
brand whiskey?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.540
(sighs)

14:02.542 --> 14:05.844
Stewie, I just feel so awful
about what happened with Dylan.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.446
I mean, every terrible thing
he said about me is true.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.281
Well, you're
a terrible guy, Bri.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.384
I think being a paid writer
again just went to my head.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.354
I mean, I just... I can't
believe I was so selfish.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.990
It's-it's like Dylan just held
a mirror up to me,

14:18.992 --> 14:22.227
and I could finally see how
poorly I'd been treating him.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.330
I guess I didn't realize how
lucky I was to have Dylan back

14:25.332 --> 14:28.466
in my life until I lost him
all over again.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.868
Well, maybe you
should just apologize.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.969
I tried to.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.838
I mean, I texted him
"S-R-Y frowny face."

14:33.840 --> 14:37.075
I mean, he knows that I'm sorry
and that I'm sad.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.712
(gasps) What are you guys
doing up so early?

14:40.714 --> 14:41.746
What-what are we...

14:41.748 --> 14:43.081
Where have you been?

14:43.083 --> 14:46.251
Well, I certainly wasn't
at the Shriners' convention.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.587
You know what
I think, Brian?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.656
I think you've got to
get down to that set

14:51.658 --> 14:53.825
and apologize
face-to-face.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.260
(sighs) You're right.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.363
I just... I hope he's willing
to hear me out, you know?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.265
(groans)
I'm the worst father ever.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.667
I'm even worse than
Marvin Gaye's dad.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.269
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.639
Marvin, if this another
tie, I'm gonna kill you.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.251
Well, looks like it's just
you and me, shadow.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.155
CROWD:
Shadow!

15:29.295 --> 15:31.362
Oh, hey, is, uh...
is Dylan back here?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.698
Sorry, Brian, Dylan says he
doesn't want to see you anymore.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.400
We're not allowed
to let you in.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.235
Well, you know what?
I'm sorry, too.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.437
For what?
For this!

15:39.439 --> 15:41.272
(grunts)

15:41.274 --> 15:43.408
Yeah, you know, you probably
would've had a better shot

15:43.410 --> 15:44.742
if you hadn't yelled
"For this!"

15:44.744 --> 15:46.110
You know,
that-that kind of telegraphed

15:46.112 --> 15:47.378
what you were gonna do.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.646
Ah, Stewie,
it's no use.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.715
They're never
gonna let us in.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.483
Well, maybe
<i>you</i> can't get in,

15:52.485 --> 15:55.153
but I think I know
someone who can.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.890
Zac Sawyer?

15:58.892 --> 16:01.292
I'm Zac Sawyer. Say "when."

16:01.294 --> 16:02.593
Acting.

16:02.595 --> 16:06.464
Singing: pop, classical,
light opera, Italian.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.001
Dancing: classical, tap, jazz.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.470
Horse riding.
Can I? Yes.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.305
Accents: 13.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.341
South American, South African,

16:16.343 --> 16:18.776
British upper class,
British Cockney.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.912
"What, Govnah?"
Somebody gonna stop me?

16:20.914 --> 16:22.413
Fencing, nunchucks.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.183
Driving?
Yes. Automatic and standard...

16:25.185 --> 16:26.651
Okay, okay. Wow.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.852
You're the worst.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.687
Welcome aboard.

16:33.258 --> 16:37.462
ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>The</i>
<i>Love Boat with Somali Pirates.</i>

16:37.464 --> 16:39.097
I am the captain now.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.765
Well, okay,
but that means

16:40.767 --> 16:43.368
you're in charge of getting
Mr. Devlin to admit

16:43.370 --> 16:44.869
that after 30 years,

16:44.871 --> 16:47.939
he still loves
Mrs. Devlin very much.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.341
That is not the captain's
responsibility!

16:50.343 --> 16:52.377
Well, maybe not where
<i>you</i> come from,

16:52.379 --> 16:54.345
but here on
the Love Boat...

16:55.614 --> 16:58.516
Now, who is Mr. Devlin?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.819
Try skinny-dipping with her
like when you were kids.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.855
Hey, Lois, if I was
gonna kill myself,

17:03.857 --> 17:06.457
do I slit my wrists
this way or this way?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.860
MEG: Sideways for attention,
long way for results!

17:08.862 --> 17:09.861
Meg is right.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.329
Okay, I'll be in
the garage.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.830
Peter, put that knife down.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.232
Lois, I don't
have any friends!

17:14.234 --> 17:15.400
So I'm gonna kill myself

17:15.402 --> 17:17.402
and get a full page
in the yearbook.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.237
Then they <i>can't</i>
<i>ignore me.</i>

17:19.239 --> 17:20.338
Who's that?

17:20.340 --> 17:21.973
I don't know.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.346
Okay, Zac, remember,
your character's name

17:28.348 --> 17:29.414
is Tevin Ashe-Taylor.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.349
You surf
and enjoy surfing.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.518
In this scene,
DJ Slopes is thinking

17:33.520 --> 17:35.019
of quitting
the detective agency,

17:35.021 --> 17:36.521
and you're like,
"No way."

17:36.523 --> 17:37.822
Got it.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.058
We're rolling!

17:40.060 --> 17:42.193
Listen, Tevin, I think
I just need more time

17:42.195 --> 17:43.728
to focus
on my snowboarding

17:43.730 --> 17:45.496
and Web series
about energy drinks.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.832
No, man, you got to stay
in the detective agency.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.234
It's what your dad
would want.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.203
What?
What are you talking about?

17:52.205 --> 17:53.704
What the hell's
that new kid doing?

17:53.706 --> 17:54.839
This isn't in the script.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.340
I'm talking about your dad, DJ.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.076
He sent me here with a message.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.079
He said he can't believe
he was so selfish.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.114
It's like you held
a mirror up to him

18:03.116 --> 18:06.417
and he could finally see how
poorly he'd been treating you.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.719
He didn't realize how lucky
he was...

18:08.721 --> 18:10.555
Stay on me,
camera one.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.723
...to have you
back in his life,

18:12.725 --> 18:16.060
and now he feels like
he's lost you all over again.

18:16.062 --> 18:19.263
But how do I know
he won't just hurt me again?

18:19.265 --> 18:21.399
You don't. You never know that.

18:21.401 --> 18:25.269
But isn't taking a risk
better than not having a dad?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.472
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.907
You're damn right I am.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.275
Cut!

18:31.277 --> 18:33.544
You know, I don't know
where any of that came from,

18:33.546 --> 18:34.445
but I liked it.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.613
Who are you?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.148
I'm Zac Sawyer.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.950
And I go where I'm needed.

18:38.952 --> 18:43.721
♪ Here I go again on my own

18:43.723 --> 18:48.126
♪ Going down the only road
I've ever known. ♪

18:48.128 --> 18:49.627
Where you headed?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.129
Wherever I'm needed.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.930
No, no, it does
not work like that.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.632
I need to put
address in machine.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.001
Okay, maybe, you can
just take me home then.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.102
Where is home?

18:58.104 --> 18:59.437
I-I don't know.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.239
It's-it's my mom
and dad's house,

19:01.241 --> 19:02.807
but I don't
know the address!

19:02.809 --> 19:04.008
I take you airport.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.576
Okay!

19:08.814 --> 19:11.516
All right, Quagmire, I have
given this a lot of thought.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.751
I need you to shoot me
in the arm

19:13.753 --> 19:15.153
so we can be friends again.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.921
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:16.923 --> 19:18.322
No, no, I was supposed
to offer,

19:18.324 --> 19:20.324
and then you were supposed
to say, "No, Peter,

19:20.326 --> 19:21.526
"I'm not gonna shoot you,

19:21.528 --> 19:22.994
although I do appreciate
the gesture."

19:22.996 --> 19:24.595
Hand me the gun, Peter.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.998
I, uh... I passed the test?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.834
No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you
like a dirty animal.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.968
But-but just the fact

19:30.970 --> 19:33.304
that I would make the offer
is so meaningful to you.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.338
Your offer means
nothing, Peter.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.806
The only thing that
means anything to me

19:35.808 --> 19:37.542
is a bullet in your arm.
Now give me that!

19:37.544 --> 19:38.809
Stop! Stop!
Quagmire, let go!

19:38.811 --> 19:40.278
Come on! You're not leaving
here without being shot!

19:40.280 --> 19:41.546
Look, I was trying
to do the decent thing,

19:41.548 --> 19:42.880
like you'd see in a movie!

19:42.882 --> 19:44.148
I'm putting that bullet
in your arm, Peter!

19:44.150 --> 19:45.783
Ah! Son of a bitch!

19:45.785 --> 19:47.952
It's over.
We're all friends again.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.187
What the hell, Joe?!

19:49.189 --> 19:50.788
I'm just trying
to settle this nonsense.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.023
Nothing got settled!
You shot him!

19:52.025 --> 19:53.624
I'm the one who
has to shoot him!

19:53.626 --> 19:56.294
Wait a second. All right, then
I get to shoot Joe, all right?

19:56.296 --> 20:00.398
He shot me! I mean, if we're
doing things fair here, then...

20:00.400 --> 20:02.733
All right, we're good.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.639
Hey, Dad.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.707
Dylan?

20:09.709 --> 20:10.975
I went to your house,

20:10.977 --> 20:12.743
and Chris told me
you'd be here.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.413
Look, Dylan, I-I'm really sorry
I hurt you.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.916
I've been a really bad father,
like Ernest Hemmingway

20:18.918 --> 20:20.318
or-or some other great writer.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.986
But if-if you'll give me
a chance,

20:21.988 --> 20:24.555
I-I'd like
to try to change that.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.591
I'd like that, too, Dad.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.340
Peter, I'm so glad you patched
things up with your friends.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.109
(slurring): Have I told you
that we're all friends again?

20:45.111 --> 20:47.878
Yes, Peter, we were just
talking about it.

20:47.880 --> 20:52.550
They're gonna take me
to the zoo and roll me around.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.086
We're all friends again.
