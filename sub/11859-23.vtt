<i>(female narrator)</i>
<i>Previously on "Cold Case.."</i>

00:03.959 --> 00:05.417
Daddy, I know you
don't want me to do this.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.542
I just want you to know,
I'm not gonna let you down.

00:07.625 --> 00:10.250
<i>(John)</i>
<i>Kate Butler. Parents</i>
<i>reported</i>
<i>her missing three years ago.</i>

00:10.333 --> 00:12.166
<i>(Lilly)</i>
<i>Pennsylvania</i>
<i>Military Institute.</i>

00:12.250 --> 00:15.166
<i>- I knew the cadets hate</i>
<i>her.</i>
<i>- Rhianna?</i>

00:15.250 --> 00:17.250
<i>(James)</i>
<i>That's what they called Ryan</i>
<i>after Kate smoked him.</i>

00:17.333 --> 00:18.542
Look, it wasn't,
it wasn't the students

00:18.625 --> 00:20.250
that Kate Butler
had to worry about.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.875
(Murillo)
'Cadet Gardner here
will show you to Moe.'

00:21.959 --> 00:23.417
He's my operations officer.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.166
Look, I'd be lying
to you to say that there

00:25.250 --> 00:27.625
wasn't resentment among
some of the cadets.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.291
- 'Lawrence.'
- 'Yes, major.'

00:31.625 --> 00:33.250
Come on, Scotty. Pick up.

02:42.583 --> 02:43.792
- Dr. Kaufman, telephone--
- 'And what day is it?'

02:43.875 --> 02:46.625
- 'Dr. Kaufman..'
- Saturday.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.500
Any blurred vision, nausea?

02:48.583 --> 02:49.667
No.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.000
No signs of hypothermia

02:51.083 --> 02:52.583
but you took a pretty good
shot to the head.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.000
Might have a concussion.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.417
Gonna need to run a couple
of tests, CT scan, for one.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.625
- We'll follow that up with--
- How long is that gonna take?

02:58.709 --> 03:00.083
The tech will be down
in a couple of minutes

03:00.166 --> 03:01.750
to bring you upstairs..

03:01.834 --> 03:03.083
...if they're not too backed up.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.625
Either way, you're gonna need

03:04.709 --> 03:07.291
to take it easy for
a while, detective, and..

03:11.750 --> 03:13.750
(John)
'Hey, where you going, Lil?'

03:13.834 --> 03:15.083
The doc released you already?

03:15.166 --> 03:17.959
Oh, uh, did all the tests
and came back fine.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.625
They haven't even
dredged your squad car out

03:19.709 --> 03:20.875
of the Neshaminy Creek yet.

03:20.959 --> 03:23.125
Did CSU find
anything at the scene?

03:23.208 --> 03:24.917
Skid marks from the vehicle
that ran you off the road.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.917
Will, Nick and Kat are
searching PMI's campus

03:27.000 --> 03:29.417
for a car
with body damage.
Lil!

03:29.500 --> 03:30.834
It was Cadet
Lawrence Gardner, boss.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.583
He-he wrote
that sword hate mail

03:32.667 --> 03:33.917
attacked Kate Butler
in the shower.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.083
He wanted her gone.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.291
- Slow down, Lil.
- I'm fine.

03:37.375 --> 03:38.750
I'm telling you.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.125
We know where Lawrence is now?

03:43.208 --> 03:44.792
'Scotty went to PMI
this morning to pick him up.'

03:44.875 --> 03:46.500
He wasn't in his
room,
anywhere on campus.

03:46.583 --> 03:50.959
We have broadcasts all over
the region lookin' for him
now.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.792
Got to be the same guy
that ran me off the road.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.041
Now, come on,
let me drive you home.

03:54.125 --> 03:55.291
At least get
a change of
clothes.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.834
Got everything I need
in my locker.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.542
(Lilly)
'Hey, guys.'

03:59.625 --> 04:02.959
- Lil. Hey, how you doin'?
- I'm fine.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.625
You'd do anything to get
outta that bucket of bolts.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.125
- Wouldn't you?
- What do you got?

04:06.208 --> 04:08.709
Picked up Lawrence's files
when I was up there.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.875
The reason he's still a
senior,
he took six months off

04:11.000 --> 04:12.375
'two weeks after
Kate disappeared.'

04:12.458 --> 04:13.834
Mom said he had mono.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.834
(Lilly)
'The oldest excuse
in the book.'

04:15.917 --> 04:17.166
What about Keith Henderson

04:17.250 --> 04:18.959
a black cadet
who said he was on tours?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.834
Yeah, checked the tours
and confinements lists.

04:20.917 --> 04:24.125
Kid was on it. The swipe card
says he never left campus.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.500
(Nick)
'Doesn't add up.'

04:25.583 --> 04:27.166
Barracks sign out log
says he left the dorm

04:27.250 --> 04:28.542
same time Kate did.

04:28.625 --> 04:30.083
That's 'cause
the log was copied.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.625
Found it last
night
in the diner.

04:31.709 --> 04:34.458
In November 15, '05,
the night Kate
disappeared.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.500
Now check this
one out. November 1.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.750
Names, signatures, times.
Everything's the same.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.333
The same damn sign out log.
Only the date's been changed.

04:42.417 --> 04:43.959
Made it look like
Kate didn't come back.

04:44.041 --> 04:46.667
The truth is,
she never even left.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.417
So, who doctored these logs?

04:48.500 --> 04:49.834
(male #1)
'Lilly.'

04:54.959 --> 04:56.166
Look, today's not the day.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.917
Only place I know
where to find you.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.500
You get the letter I sent?

05:02.083 --> 05:04.959
You can't fix everything
with a damn letter, dad.

05:05.041 --> 05:06.834
You at least read it?

05:11.792 --> 05:13.375
Lilly?

05:24.250 --> 05:26.375
Your turn, pook.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.875
'I know.'

05:32.041 --> 05:34.250
Lilly..

05:34.333 --> 05:35.875
...I have to go do some things.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.542
It means that I..

05:39.625 --> 05:43.041
...I may have
to be gone a while.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.500
Where are you going?

05:46.625 --> 05:48.083
Don't know yet.

05:48.709 --> 05:50.000
With Mommy?

05:51.375 --> 05:52.917
No, no, I don't,
I don't think so.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.291
Probably not.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.458
Who's gonna sleep by her?

06:00.125 --> 06:03.583
Well, sometimes
mommies and daddies

06:03.667 --> 06:07.250
they don't, they don't
sleep by each other.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.959
Which way can I
move my knight?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.125
Uh..

06:16.208 --> 06:17.625
L move, two and one.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.542
But if you take my pawn, I'll
take your knight with my rook.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.250
Or you could do that.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.709
You really are a smart kid.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.625
(male #1)
'Lilly.'

06:45.125 --> 06:46.458
'What's the matter?'

06:47.792 --> 06:50.375
- 'Are you okay?'
- I gotta get back.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.709
Celeste.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.959
My wife's name.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.709
Been married 22 years.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.959
We have a daughter Maggie
and a son Finn.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.375
'They wanna meet you.'

07:04.667 --> 07:06.000
(John)
'Lil.'

07:09.583 --> 07:11.792
John Stillman.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.166
Paul Cooper.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.500
I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.709
You're not.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.083
I got to go.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.709
We found the car that
ran you off the road.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.500
(John)
It's on the PMI campus.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.083
Passenger side mirror is busted.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.458
Dent, front right side.

07:31.542 --> 07:32.792
Paint transfer from another car.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.542
CSU tech took a sample.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.750
Looks like yours.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.166
Said the treads looked good

07:37.250 --> 07:39.417
'for the skid marks
at the scene.'

07:39.500 --> 07:41.291
Is it the car that hit you?

07:41.375 --> 07:42.583
All I saw were the headlights.

07:42.667 --> 07:45.000
Hey. Glad you're okay.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.750
Thanks.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.417
PMI staffer said
it's a campus car.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.667
- Tow squad's on its way.
- Belongs to the school?

07:50.750 --> 07:53.834
We just got to find out who had
access and where the keys are.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.542
Time to shut this campus down.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.458
Trap a rat in his hole.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.625
(Moe)
'DEFCON ONE
in effect, detectives.'

08:01.709 --> 08:02.875
Front gate is closed.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.250
Every door with a handle
or hinge, locked down.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.417
Who are the campus cars for?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.625
We make them available
to administrators

08:07.709 --> 08:08.709
when they need them.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.875
What about students?

08:09.959 --> 08:10.959
Only senior aides.

08:11.041 --> 08:12.709
(Lilly)
'Lawrence Gardner.'

08:12.792 --> 08:14.125
He a senior aide?

08:16.667 --> 08:18.542
Assaulting and
killing Kate Butler.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.208
(Moe)
'Running a cop off the road.'

08:20.291 --> 08:21.375
'Those are some
serious accusations--'

08:21.458 --> 08:23.583
A Suburban with the damage.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.667
(Scotty)
'Was Lawrence usin' it?'

08:28.375 --> 08:29.709
He was picking up
a football recruit

08:29.792 --> 08:34.417
at the airport yesterday.
Still has the keys.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.041
Did Lawrence have access to the
barracks sign out logs in '05?

08:38.125 --> 08:39.959
Lawrence always done
his best to serve the school.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.417
Just answer the question.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.834
He was Echo Company clerk.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.083
Why did Lawrence
take a six month

08:47.166 --> 08:49.750
leave of absence, December '05?

08:49.834 --> 08:51.291
Wasn't mono, was it, Moe?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.959
- Fatigue.
- 'Fatigue.'

08:55.041 --> 08:57.041
You saying the kid
had some kind of breakdown?

08:58.959 --> 09:02.000
Looking back...a few days
before she disappeared

09:02.083 --> 09:03.667
all starts to make sense.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.959
Fight till you drop.

09:07.041 --> 09:09.917
You go down, you die.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.875
Someone will take care
of your girl. Understood?

09:12.959 --> 09:14.667
(all)
Sir, yes, sir!

09:16.291 --> 09:17.542
Now, which one
of you chuckleheads

09:17.625 --> 09:19.625
'thinks he can take
Cadet Lawrence.'

09:19.709 --> 09:21.959
(Moe)
'Best pugil stick
in Echo Company?'

09:25.875 --> 09:27.458
No one wants to man up?

09:27.542 --> 09:29.709
I'd like a shot, sir.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.959
Cadet Butler, you a man?

09:32.041 --> 09:33.792
No, sir.
But I'd like a shot, sir.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.208
'Think you're special, Butler?'

09:35.291 --> 09:36.542
Is that how you see yourself?

09:36.625 --> 09:37.834
Special as a snowflake?

09:37.917 --> 09:39.750
Sir, I'm no snowflake, sir.

09:41.542 --> 09:44.166
Step up, maxipad.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.208
Lawrence, take no prisoners.

09:46.291 --> 09:47.208
Yes, sir.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.375
(male #2)
'Hit him, Kate!'

09:57.458 --> 09:59.041
- Come on!
- Come on, Lawrence.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.667
(male #3)
'Don't let a girl
kick your ass.'

10:00.750 --> 10:02.625
'Come on, Lawrence,
don't let her get you.'

10:02.709 --> 10:04.500
(male #4)
'Knock that bitch down!'

10:08.709 --> 10:10.000
(male #5)
'Get up, Kate. Come on!'

10:12.750 --> 10:14.959
(male #6)
'Take her down, Lawrence.'

10:22.667 --> 10:25.250
Don't you ever
come near me again.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.875
(Moe)
'Girl was tougher
than I thought.'

10:37.959 --> 10:39.583
You're saying
she was out for revenge?

10:39.667 --> 10:42.333
Didn't know about
the assault at the time.

10:42.417 --> 10:44.166
Well, Lawrence didn't
walk out the front gate.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.375
And he's gotta be holed up
somewhere on campus.

10:46.458 --> 10:50.917
There's only one room
in the barracks with a lock.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.750
Where's the key to Kate's room?

11:01.709 --> 11:03.709
Police, open up.

11:08.667 --> 11:09.959
Scotty.

11:11.417 --> 11:13.000
Get him down.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.375
Forget it, he's gone.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.875
Key to the room.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.583
And keys to the Suburban.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.375
Son of a bitch.

11:35.458 --> 11:38.500
- Look at the rope.
- Standard slipknot.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.041
(Scotty)
'It's on the right side.'

11:40.125 --> 11:41.834
How did he tie it himself?

11:41.917 --> 11:43.917
Lawrence was left-handed.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.333
(Lilly)
'Knot should be
on the other side.'

11:49.417 --> 11:51.959
Rope's up under the chin.
Like he was lifted up.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.291
Did it himself, it would've
dug into his Adam's apple.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.542
Marks on the back of the neck.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.625
This kid didn't kill himself.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.208
Someone did it for him.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.291
(male #7)
'Face front.'

12:38.083 --> 12:40.583
(male #8)
'Lilly?'

12:40.667 --> 12:41.959
You alright?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.041
Number three.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.208
You sure?

12:48.291 --> 12:49.667
Yes.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.917
It was him.

12:52.417 --> 12:53.667
Number three, John.

13:01.291 --> 13:03.834
You're a brave girl, Lilly Rush.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.375
Who are you?

13:05.458 --> 13:08.917
John Stillman.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.375
Detective Stillman's the one
who
caught the man that hurt you.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.709
My mother said
it was too late.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.625
(John)
'Long as you ask
the right questions..'

13:18.250 --> 13:19.917
...never too late.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.500
(Will)
'Lil?'

13:30.500 --> 13:32.458
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm tired, that's all.

13:32.542 --> 13:36.208
I asked around. Lawrence spent
his share of time in the
chapel.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.458
'Religious type.'

13:37.542 --> 13:38.959
Explains all that
biblical hate mail.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.875
Hiding her nakedness
from the sight of God.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.333
'Gonna talk to his chaplain.'

13:42.417 --> 13:44.208
See if he confided
in him about anything.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.458
(Scotty)
'Campus lockdown came
a little too late.'

13:48.542 --> 13:49.875
Coroner thinks Lawrence
might've been killed

13:49.959 --> 13:51.375
some time last night.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.250
Get back to your duties.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.875
All hail the commandant.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.458
Detective Rush. I've just
informed Cadet Gardner's
family.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.458
Second homicide in four years.

14:00.542 --> 14:01.792
You got a PR
disaster
on your hands.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.375
I was told this was a suicide.

14:03.458 --> 14:07.041
Lawrence was dead
before he was hung.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.291
Someone must've found out
we were lookin' at him.

14:09.375 --> 14:13.250
- This happened last night?
- That mean something to you?

14:13.333 --> 14:14.834
Hank Butler came to see me.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.667
He had been drinking.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.500
You son of a bitch.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.792
My daughter's gone.
Kate is gone.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.875
- Hank, sit down.
- You were in charge, Lou.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.250
I tried talking to her

14:28.333 --> 14:29.709
but she was
her father's daughter.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.291
She kept her own counsel.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.750
Talk to her about what?

14:33.834 --> 14:36.041
A racking. That may
have gone too far.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.291
Why didn't you call me?

14:39.375 --> 14:42.041
You said no special treatment.

14:47.792 --> 14:49.000
What happened?

14:54.125 --> 14:56.542
Couple of weeks
before she disappeared

14:56.625 --> 14:58.041
I think she may
have been assaulted.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.041
I want the name of every
cadre in Echo Company.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.375
Now.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.417
Hank and I were knobs together.
We graduated the same year.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.333
And you gave him those names?

15:15.417 --> 15:17.458
He would've found out anyway.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.792
Lawrence Gardner on that list?

15:20.875 --> 15:22.083
What time did
he leave your office?

15:22.166 --> 15:23.375
(Murillo)
'Little after midnight.'

15:23.458 --> 15:26.959
I assumed he went
straight home but...now..

15:28.834 --> 15:32.458
(Scotty)
'Forgot this the
last time you were here.'

15:32.542 --> 15:36.500
I heard about a guy who
lost his PMI ring at boot
camp.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.000
Ten year anniversary

15:38.083 --> 15:40.792
his wife had a replacement made
to the exact specs.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.166
Cadet number
inside,
and whole nine.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.375
Charlotte told you about that?

15:44.458 --> 15:46.083
You used to love that school.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.875
- It's hard to remember.
- How about last night?

15:49.959 --> 15:52.500
- Remember that, Hank?
- Yeah, I do.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.000
Had a date with a bottle.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.625
Was a terrible date.

15:55.709 --> 15:56.875
Just what I wanted.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.542
That date go down at PMI?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.834
Sallyport guard saw your car
leaving campus at 3:00 a.m.

16:01.917 --> 16:05.083
About the time Cadet
Lawrence Gardner was
killed.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.834
- 'Eye for an eye, Hank?'
- I didn't hurt anyone.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.583
(Scotty)
'You find that son of
a bitch before we did?'

16:14.667 --> 16:18.208
I know what I said...
but I saw the chapel.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.709
- The chapel, Hank?
- 'Yeah.'

16:20.792 --> 16:22.041
And I asked God's forgiveness

16:22.125 --> 16:24.000
for what happened
last time I was there.

16:26.917 --> 16:29.208
(James)
'Attention to orders.'

16:29.291 --> 16:31.333
'As first sergeant,
Echo Company'

16:31.417 --> 16:33.834
'I'd like to present
the PMI Distinction Medal'

16:33.917 --> 16:38.542
'to a fourth class cadet who
has
shown outstanding merit.'

16:38.625 --> 16:40.875
'Cadet Butler.'

16:40.959 --> 16:42.417
Front and center.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.125
Sir.

16:47.208 --> 16:49.041
Cadet Butler, you have
displayed
outstanding qualities

16:49.125 --> 16:52.000
in both academics
and physical training.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.041
Thank you, sir.

16:55.125 --> 16:56.625
Do you have anything to say?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.208
Yes, I do, sir.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.583
Stand at ease.

17:03.667 --> 17:08.083
"What we obtain too cheap,
we esteem too lightly.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.917
'Tis dearness only that gives
everything its value."

17:12.000 --> 17:13.166
I didn't understand why

17:13.250 --> 17:15.000
First Sergeant Addison
was quoting Thomas Paine

17:15.083 --> 17:17.458
our first day here..

17:17.542 --> 17:19.417
...but I do now.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.333
We might not be fighting
the American Revolution

17:21.417 --> 17:24.792
like he was,
but we're still fighting.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.417
Fighting for
the strength to keep at it.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.834
Fighting for
the respect of our company.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.583
And for the pride
of our families.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.375
I hope to earn them all someday.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.417
Echo Company, atten-hut!

17:52.125 --> 17:54.166
I remember the first day
she was born.

17:55.792 --> 17:58.959
Those tiny little hands,
they had such a tight grip.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.458
Like she'd never let go.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.166
Three hours is long time
to spend on your chapel.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.959
(Lilly)
'Sure you didn't go anywhere
else that night, Hank?'

18:06.041 --> 18:09.000
I didn't go lookin'
for those cadets.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.375
I left the list
that Murillo gave me

18:10.458 --> 18:13.041
on his secretary's desk.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.792
Gonna be checking
with her on that.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.458
It was the last chance I had
to tell her how proud I was.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.083
And I walked away.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.500
Got the Bucks
County Coroner's report

18:28.583 --> 18:30.792
on Cadet Lawrence Gardner.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.000
Cause of death,
manual
strangulation.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.750
And no scrapings under his
nails, no bruises or cuts.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.166
Kid didn't put up a fight.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.375
Or it happened so fast,
he didn't have time to wake
up.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.458
Chaplain said Lawrence
helped out with the services.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.000
He was runnin'
a spiritual retreat

18:43.083 --> 18:44.291
the night Kate was killed.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.917
Off campus the whole weekend.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.458
So, he couldn't have killed her.

18:47.542 --> 18:49.917
Well, find out who else
had access to that Suburban.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.709
If Lawrence wasn't drivin'
it,
I wanna know who was.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.375
CSU found something
in Kate's quarters

18:54.458 --> 18:56.250
where Lawrence's body was found.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.500
A letter to Kate.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.542
'Found it rolled up
inside
the metal bar in her
closet.'

19:05.625 --> 19:07.417
"Three good reasons
we should be together.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.333
"One, They'll never find out.

19:09.417 --> 19:12.041
"Two, No one could
love you as much as I do.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.667
"Three, I can't live
without you.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.083
J.F.A."

19:16.166 --> 19:17.709
J.F.A. James Addison?

19:17.792 --> 19:19.834
James Frederick Addison.

19:19.917 --> 19:21.875
Commandant asked him
to keep an eye on
Kate.

19:21.959 --> 19:24.000
Gives a whole new meaning
to shine detail.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.542
Kate decides to call it off.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.792
But he won't let her go.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.291
Puts her in
a footlocker instead.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.041
Hey. Got Romeo
in the box. You ready?

19:45.917 --> 19:47.625
Be right there.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.959
Son, congratulations.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.250
Hey, Lil, you comin' or what?

20:24.333 --> 20:26.792
You see my dad come
by here a few minutes ago?

20:28.875 --> 20:31.709
No. No. Is everything alright?

20:31.792 --> 20:33.125
Yeah. Yeah.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.291
Just tryin' to tie up
some loose ends, lieutenant.

20:40.375 --> 20:44.166
What you told us about Kate
being attacked in the
showers.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.625
- I told you everything I
know.
- Right, on shine detail.

20:47.709 --> 20:49.041
She ever mention being
romantically involved

20:49.125 --> 20:50.333
with another cadet?

20:50.417 --> 20:51.625
No. She wasn't.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.333
Well, you seem
pretty sure about that.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.667
She wouldn't risk violating
the non-fraternization
policy.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.000
Would you?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.250
I don't know what you mean.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.875
Found this love
letter
in her room.

21:03.959 --> 21:05.458
It's your handwriting, Don Juan.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.500
'You didn't just watch out
for Cadet Butler.'

21:07.583 --> 21:08.834
You took advantage of her.

21:08.917 --> 21:10.750
A senior cadet is
a position of power.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.000
She couldn't get rid
of you if she wanted to.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.709
She wasn't getting rid of me.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.291
You knew about the assault,
that Lawrence was unstable.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.667
Told us about
the barracks sign out log.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.500
The list of guards with sabers.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.208
(Scotty)
'You knew Lawrence would
look good for her murder.'

21:21.291 --> 21:25.000
You string him up, case
closed,
right, we all go home.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.166
It's a beautiful job.

21:29.250 --> 21:31.583
You just...put the knot

21:31.667 --> 21:33.709
'on the wrong damn side.'

21:33.792 --> 21:35.375
I don't get it. I thought
Lawrence killed himself.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.917
Lawrence didn't kill
himself, James.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.542
Just like Kate didn't run away.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.041
Give us three good reasons

21:40.125 --> 21:41.875
we shouldn't lock
your lying ass up.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.583
Alright, so I liked her.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.750
And when she didn't
like you back..

21:53.834 --> 21:56.041
...what did you do then, James?

21:56.125 --> 21:57.542
I wrote her that letter.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.166
She doesn't give you
the answer you're looking
for.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.208
Try and convince her
otherwise, she says
no.

22:01.291 --> 22:05.375
No! She felt the same way.
I know she did.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.750
Cadet Butler.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.792
There's a million good reasons
we should be together, James.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.583
But I can't.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.125
Not until after Recognition Day.

22:33.208 --> 22:34.583
What's gonna change then?

22:34.667 --> 22:37.000
Won't be a knob anymore.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.291
They won't treat you
any different, Kate.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.625
- Trust me.
- The hell with them.

22:39.709 --> 22:42.291
I'm not doing this for them.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.583
You're doing it
'cause of your old man.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.709
Growin' up, my dad
talked about this
place

22:50.792 --> 22:53.250
like the Earth
revolved around it.

22:53.333 --> 22:56.041
But now, I'm doin' it for me.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.959
And the harder they push,
the harder I fight back.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.291
If that's the way
you want to go about it

22:59.375 --> 23:01.625
it's gonna be a long four years.

23:01.709 --> 23:02.959
I won that medal legit.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.500
'Lots of guys won medals, Kate.'

23:04.583 --> 23:06.583
Just 'cause you can hack it
doesn't mean they'll accept
you.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.291
I can't make them like me.

23:09.959 --> 23:12.500
They think you're some tight
ass
grinder, a barracks rat.

23:12.583 --> 23:14.458
You never go out, you never
even let them get to know you.

23:14.542 --> 23:15.959
You don't think I want that?

23:16.041 --> 23:17.208
I've never been invited.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.000
I'm inviting you now.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.750
You said it yourself.
They hate me.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.583
Well, then, let them see
the other side of you.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.458
The side that I see.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.125
Don't just prove to them
that you can hack it

23:32.208 --> 23:33.750
prove to them that you belong.

23:36.959 --> 23:40.250
I thought she was gonna
come out that night and meet
me.

23:40.333 --> 23:44.083
That maybe things could change
for Kate at the school.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.959
But she never showed up?
I didn't blame her.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.458
(James)
'I mean, the guys were tough.'

23:48.542 --> 23:51.834
But no barracks rat
ever makes it through PMI.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.333
Barracks rat?

23:53.417 --> 23:55.500
They're guys who hole up
in the dorms all weekend.

23:55.583 --> 23:58.792
Too stressful a place. You...
you gotta blow off some steam.

24:00.417 --> 24:01.959
(James)
'There's no way you can make
it'

24:02.041 --> 24:04.208
through that school
without friends.

24:06.291 --> 24:07.583
Excuse me.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.917
You alright?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.500
Freezing.

24:15.583 --> 24:16.667
Who turned off the heat?

24:16.750 --> 24:18.041
Cutbacks.
Dropped the thermostat.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.500
Do me a favor.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.709
Check the sign out logs
for all of Kate's knob year.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.333
Find the barracks rats.

24:24.417 --> 24:26.333
Cadets who never
left on the weekends.

24:49.625 --> 24:50.875
Ma'am?

25:23.500 --> 25:25.083
You wanted to see me,
lieutenant?

25:25.166 --> 25:28.166
I see you made the pinch
on that carjacking, Rush.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.500
Yes, lieutenant.
Had a lucky day.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.959
You create your luck
by hard work.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.417
Well, if I was paying
more attention

25:34.500 --> 25:35.542
I might have caught
the guy before he got

25:35.625 --> 25:37.417
out onto the highway.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.250
You did well on the
detective's test, too.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.834
Looks like
you'll make it next week.

25:40.917 --> 25:43.917
Thank you, sir. Figure
I'll probably end up in
east.

25:44.041 --> 25:45.500
I have a few guys
set to retire here

25:45.583 --> 25:46.583
in the next couple of years.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.083
I could use somebody

25:48.166 --> 25:50.458
with your instincts
and determination.

25:52.667 --> 25:55.625
- Homicide?
- You interested?

25:55.709 --> 25:56.750
Of course, sir.

25:56.834 --> 25:58.625
Well, learn your job
at east, do it right.

25:58.709 --> 26:01.875
I'll keep an eye out, and
we'll talk when the time
comes.

26:01.959 --> 26:03.125
I'll be ready, sir.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.417
Good, because you'll be

26:04.500 --> 26:05.667
the first female
homicide detective

26:05.750 --> 26:07.750
in the Philly
Police Department.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.834
You're gonna need a thick skin.

26:09.917 --> 26:12.083
I can handle myself.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.083
I knew that a long time ago.

26:35.417 --> 26:37.375
There was a letter sitting
on my desk. You see it?

26:37.458 --> 26:42.250
Nope. But I did check out the
barracks sign out log from
'05.

26:42.333 --> 26:44.500
- All of 'em?
- Hup two.

26:44.583 --> 26:47.166
There's only one cadet
who never left the barracks

26:47.250 --> 26:50.417
on a weekend
his entire knob year.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.667
Ryan Stewart.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.500
Never even went home
for the holidays.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.250
You should check out
his transcript.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.250
(Lilly)
'With those marks,
it's a wonder they let him'

26:57.333 --> 26:58.291
stay at the school at all.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.709
'Rhianna had a lot of issues.'

26:59.792 --> 27:01.959
You know, being soft,
dull and friendless

27:02.041 --> 27:03.750
is no way to go through college.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.583
Cadet Ryan Stewart, Philly PD.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.000
(Ryan)
'Go away!'

27:11.583 --> 27:12.709
There's something blocking it.

27:12.792 --> 27:14.792
Open the door,
you little pissant.

27:14.875 --> 27:16.709
- Just leave me alone!
- 'Relax, Ryan.'

27:16.792 --> 27:17.959
- We just want to talk.
- No.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.041
There's nothing to talk about.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.667
I can't take this anymore.

27:20.750 --> 27:22.208
(Lilly)
'Take what anymore?'

27:22.291 --> 27:25.125
'What you did to Kate?'

27:25.208 --> 27:27.291
Look, I'm sick of lying.

27:29.542 --> 27:30.792
We can help.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.834
(Lilly)
'Come on, Ryan.
We can help you.'

27:35.291 --> 27:36.875
(Ryan)
'Nobody's gonna help me.'

27:36.959 --> 27:39.834
'Look, I c-can't go to jail.
Nobody's gonna bail me out.'

27:39.917 --> 27:42.542
Bad shape. Bad shape.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.208
Gun!

27:46.291 --> 27:47.208
You come any closer

27:47.291 --> 27:48.542
I swear to God I'm gonna shoot.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.959
You don't have
to worry about that.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.667
I'm gonna blow your
brains out for you.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.041
(Lilly)
'Hey!'

27:58.959 --> 28:01.417
(Vera)
'Get your ass on the ground!'

28:01.500 --> 28:03.417
It was me.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.041
I did it.

28:06.208 --> 28:07.500
I'm sorry.

28:12.750 --> 28:15.083
Alright, you ready?

28:15.166 --> 28:17.000
Talk about that night.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.250
Alright, it was
just me in the barracks.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.750
(Lilly)
'That Saturday night?'

28:23.834 --> 28:25.583
November 15, 2005?

28:25.667 --> 28:27.083
Every Saturday night.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.375
You know, it was just me.

28:31.041 --> 28:32.250
Kate was there, too?

28:32.333 --> 28:35.166
The only other cadet around.

28:35.250 --> 28:38.792
And even with all the crap
that she took, she was a
girl.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.291
And they still liked her
better than me.

28:52.291 --> 28:54.500
Ryan? What are you doing here?

28:54.583 --> 28:56.333
Oh, it's...it's calculus.

28:56.417 --> 28:58.458
This new chapter is killing me.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.959
I heard you were
a great tutor, so I..

29:00.041 --> 29:01.250
I haven't even looked at it yet.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.291
Oh, I just figured
you'd probably be

29:03.375 --> 29:05.000
holed up studying too, so..

29:05.083 --> 29:07.333
You're not goin' out?

29:07.417 --> 29:08.458
No. What's new?

29:08.542 --> 29:11.250
I guess we have
that in common, huh?

29:18.375 --> 29:19.667
Why don't you take my notes?

29:19.750 --> 29:22.000
Oh. Okay, cool.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.375
'Um..'

29:25.834 --> 29:27.542
So, what are you...
what's up? Are you just..

29:27.625 --> 29:30.500
- 'Are you just goin' to bed?'
- Look, Ryan, I gotta get
ready.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.458
Where you going?

29:36.542 --> 29:39.041
Meetin' some of the guys.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.875
You're kidding.

29:40.959 --> 29:42.083
Who?

29:42.166 --> 29:43.333
Echo Company?

29:46.542 --> 29:48.458
They-they invited you out?

29:51.041 --> 29:52.667
- You should come, too.
- No.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.834
I get it. They'd, uh..

29:56.917 --> 29:59.709
They'd rather hang out
with a chick than me.

29:59.792 --> 30:00.875
- Come on, Ryan.
- 'Oh, no, no.'

30:00.959 --> 30:03.542
Oh, you mean, Rihanna, right?

30:03.625 --> 30:05.458
- A worthless tub of goo?
- Don't say that.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.166
You got to show them
you can hang with them.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.542
You probably just think that
I'll wash out anyway, right?

30:09.625 --> 30:11.542
Is that what,
that's what you think,
right?

30:11.625 --> 30:13.208
- No. I didn't say that.
- 'No.'

30:13.291 --> 30:14.458
You-you think that. Right?

30:14.542 --> 30:16.125
They all think it.

30:17.834 --> 30:19.583
You-you know
that the guys above us

30:19.667 --> 30:21.250
they all say
that they're the last true
class

30:21.333 --> 30:22.375
of PMI because of you.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.417
Not 'cause of me.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.208
You have ruined everything!

30:26.291 --> 30:28.208
You know, graduating from here
used to mean something.

30:28.291 --> 30:31.250
- Ryan, just take the notes.
- No, I don't want the notes.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.667
Damn it, Ryan.

30:40.583 --> 30:43.125
And I just kept
waiting for her

30:43.208 --> 30:44.500
to stand up..

30:47.667 --> 30:50.250
...but she didn't.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.917
How did you
get rid of the body?

30:54.250 --> 30:55.500
What?

30:59.375 --> 31:01.875
You were a freshman.
You didn't have a car.

31:01.959 --> 31:04.125
So how did you
get rid of the body?

31:18.458 --> 31:20.458
Somebody helped him.

31:20.542 --> 31:21.875
Lawrence?

31:21.959 --> 31:23.083
Kid doesn't have it in him

31:23.166 --> 31:25.208
to pull off
a premeditated
murder.

31:25.291 --> 31:28.208
And why confess
to one murder, but not
two?

31:29.709 --> 31:31.417
(Kat)
'The Suburban
from PMI that hit you'

31:31.500 --> 31:34.291
was ticketed five times
in the past four years.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.709
95 South,
76 West and Ridge Avenue.

31:37.792 --> 31:39.625
On the way to Roxborough.

31:39.709 --> 31:41.792
Same driver
used the car every time.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.875
(Scotty)
Army. Rangers, right?

31:45.959 --> 31:48.750
Got to be a tough son of a
bitch
to wear that beret.

31:48.834 --> 31:53.291
Then came back to PMI
in '87 as a PT
instructor.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.417
You're an institution.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.792
Part of the long blue line.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.000
A fourth generation..

32:00.083 --> 32:01.333
...sir.

32:02.834 --> 32:05.834
Been looking over
Ryan Stewart's transcript.

32:05.917 --> 32:09.917
Uh, academic probation twice.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.875
Poor to failing marks in..

32:15.709 --> 32:16.959
...PT.

32:17.041 --> 32:18.458
Ma'am?

32:20.000 --> 32:23.417
The kid was a-a non-hacker.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.000
Hardly PMI material.

32:25.083 --> 32:27.166
Hindsight is always 20/20.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.583
Yeah, but you
promoted that
chucklehead.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.834
Got your signature
on his evaluations.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.000
"Cadet Stewart shows promise."

32:35.083 --> 32:36.834
You saying
I gave him a pass, detective?

32:36.917 --> 32:38.500
That what it sounds like to you?

32:38.583 --> 32:41.500
Took another look
at those campus car records.

32:41.583 --> 32:42.709
Every Sunday morning

32:42.792 --> 32:44.959
it was you who checked out
one of those cars.

32:45.041 --> 32:47.041
I take my mother
to mass on Sundays.

32:47.125 --> 32:48.375
(Lilly)
'A diligent son.'

32:48.458 --> 32:50.250
Well, it turns out
you're a creature of habit.

32:50.333 --> 32:51.792
You got three speeding tickets

32:51.875 --> 32:54.041
Two on the 76,
and another on Ridge Avenue.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.542
- 'Same car.'
- I like to be on time.

32:56.625 --> 32:59.917
See, Ridge Ave off 76
goes right through
Roxborough.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.583
And the cemetery where
Kate Butler's body was
buried.

33:02.667 --> 33:04.375
Now you're saying
I had something to do

33:04.458 --> 33:06.542
with Cadet Butler's murder?

33:06.625 --> 33:08.041
Told you,
Lawrence drove that car.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.291
Lawrence was just
the clerk who knew too much.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.583
Knew about the doctored
sign out logs from the
barracks.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.166
Lawrence Gardner was unstable.

33:14.250 --> 33:15.375
What you wanted us
to think when you stuffed

33:15.458 --> 33:17.208
the car keys in his pocket.

33:17.291 --> 33:18.917
(Scotty)
'They teach you that in
hand-to-hand combat training'

33:19.000 --> 33:21.875
how to kill a man
in his sleep, string him up?

33:23.583 --> 33:24.709
Pretty fanciful.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.250
Yeah.

33:26.333 --> 33:29.417
Same way you panicked
when my partner got too
close.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.834
Ran her off the
road
in that same car.

33:35.667 --> 33:38.417
What happened between
Cadets Stewart and Butler

33:38.500 --> 33:40.041
was tragic and shameful

33:40.125 --> 33:41.959
but if you're looking
to spread the blame

33:42.041 --> 33:43.792
I suggest you start
with the courts.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.166
The courts..

33:46.750 --> 33:48.083
...killed Kate Butler?

33:48.166 --> 33:49.542
(Moe)
'Do you know
how many congressmen'

33:49.625 --> 33:51.000
'have graduated from PMI?'

33:51.083 --> 33:52.250
Twelve.

33:52.333 --> 33:55.458
Six senators,
eight four-star
generals.

33:55.542 --> 33:56.709
Those courts ordered us

33:56.792 --> 33:58.959
to change the way
we do things here.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.333
Now here we are.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.291
Stuck installing women's
latrines and tampon
dispensers.

34:05.375 --> 34:08.834
There are over 60 women's
colleges in this country

34:08.917 --> 34:11.959
do you see any men banging down
the doors trying to get in?

34:12.041 --> 34:14.959
The value
of a separate education

34:15.041 --> 34:16.792
<i>separate!</i>

34:19.417 --> 34:20.625
Sound bitter, Moe.

34:20.709 --> 34:22.959
Because of this
catastrophic
experiment

34:23.041 --> 34:25.458
an army of lawyers
and press stand
ready

34:25.542 --> 34:28.208
to shut down
the
institution I
love.

34:28.291 --> 34:31.000
The one thing I
share with my
father

34:31.083 --> 34:33.458
and his before him.

34:33.542 --> 34:36.291
Excuse me if I
forgot to shed a tear

34:36.375 --> 34:38.417
for Hank Butler's daughter.

34:39.709 --> 34:41.875
(Scotty)
'That why you buried her?'

34:48.250 --> 34:50.875
Think I'll take
one of those lawyers now.

35:12.834 --> 35:14.542
Long night?

35:16.917 --> 35:18.834
Can't piece it together.

35:20.291 --> 35:21.417
The story?

35:24.417 --> 35:26.500
What you always told me.

35:26.583 --> 35:31.041
Ask the right questions
till the story makes sense.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.083
So what's the right question?

35:42.458 --> 35:45.041
You remember
the honor code, Ryan?

35:45.125 --> 35:47.709
"A cadet shall
not
lie, cheat, or
steal

35:47.792 --> 35:49.125
nor tolerate
those who
do."

35:49.208 --> 35:50.208
"He."

35:50.291 --> 35:51.542
What?

35:51.625 --> 35:53.375
"Nor shall
he

35:53.458 --> 35:56.083
That's right.
By and for men.

35:56.166 --> 35:59.291
The way it's always been.
The way Moe wants it to
stay.

36:00.542 --> 36:02.250
Now see, Moe believed in me.

36:04.291 --> 36:06.208
Still worried
he'll think less of you?

36:06.291 --> 36:08.041
That you're not a man
if you don't take the rap?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.834
Not PMI material?

36:09.917 --> 36:11.917
The school has a tradition.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.083
It has a code.

36:13.166 --> 36:15.417
That's what he'd have
you believe.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.542
But if the honor code
is the backbone of PMI..

36:20.458 --> 36:22.083
...why did he ask you to lie?

36:30.166 --> 36:31.917
Lawrence Gardner didn't
kill himself, did he?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.542
No, he didn't, Ryan.

36:35.458 --> 36:37.417
I went to tell him
what I did wrong.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.166
I didn't know what else to do.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.250
You'd better have
a hell of a good reason

36:45.333 --> 36:47.083
for bothering me
on a Saturday night, boy.

36:47.166 --> 36:50.625
I hurt her, sir.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.000
Get in here.

36:55.625 --> 36:56.959
Get a hold of
yourself,
cadet.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.000
- Who did you hurt?
- Cadet Butler, sir.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.792
I hit her and she didn't get up.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.417
- Where is she?
- In her room.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.750
She's not breathing, sir.

37:03.834 --> 37:04.875
What do you mean
she's not
breathing?

37:04.959 --> 37:06.834
I didn't mean it, sir.

37:13.375 --> 37:14.375
Who else knows?

37:14.458 --> 37:16.000
Came straight to you, sir.

37:26.709 --> 37:29.125
You want to graduate from
this
institution, don't you, son?

37:29.208 --> 37:30.375
More than anything, sir.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.166
Be a PMI man just
like your father?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.333
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Good.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.125
Go get a
footlocker
out of storage.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.417
This did not happen.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.667
Not on this campus.
Do you understand me, son?

37:48.750 --> 37:50.458
Loud and clear, sir.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.709
As you were.

37:57.834 --> 38:01.000
Sir, yes, sir.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.333
(Lilly)
'Got you, Moe.'

38:09.417 --> 38:11.250
That so?

38:11.333 --> 38:13.333
You sent Ryan
for that footlocker.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.542
Made Cadet Butler's
body disappear

38:15.625 --> 38:17.375
and you framed
Lawrence for the job.

38:17.458 --> 38:22.166
What, now you're gonna tell me
that kid is really dead?

38:23.750 --> 38:25.000
I just..

38:27.083 --> 38:29.375
I just know he didn't do it.

38:29.458 --> 38:30.959
That's all that matters.

38:32.417 --> 38:33.625
Stories.

38:35.083 --> 38:38.166
You're just
telling yourself stories.

38:40.667 --> 38:42.500
Even tried to take out a cop.

38:42.583 --> 38:43.458
You?

38:43.542 --> 38:44.709
Busier than a one-legged man

38:44.792 --> 38:46.375
in an ass-kicking
competition, Moe.

38:50.250 --> 38:53.458
You can only keep the flood
back for so long, detective.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.542
The flood?

38:57.625 --> 39:01.250
Pretty soon it's going
to pull you down..

39:01.333 --> 39:02.709
...for good.

39:09.125 --> 39:11.041
You put
that
girl in a
box!

39:14.875 --> 39:16.792
I put you there,
too, sweetheart.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.792
No.

39:32.875 --> 39:34.500
No, I got out.

39:34.583 --> 39:35.917
I got you!

39:38.125 --> 39:40.458
[whispering]
Not from where I'm sitting.

39:54.709 --> 39:56.959
What the hell is going on?

40:03.041 --> 40:04.917
<i>(John)</i>
<i>Long as you ask</i>
<i>the right questions..</i>

40:05.000 --> 40:06.792
<i>...never too late.</i>

40:43.875 --> 40:45.583
It's okay, Lil.
Now it's going to be okay.

40:45.667 --> 40:48.166
We're gonna get this
guy.
Alright, we'll get him.

40:48.250 --> 40:51.500
EMT said she kept going on
about the barracks sign out
log.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.917
Just located the car
that ran her off the road.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.208
On campus.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.250
<i>(Cooper)</i>
<i>Dear Lilly.</i>

41:01.333 --> 41:03.542
<i>There are two sides</i>
<i>to every story.</i>

41:03.625 --> 41:06.875
<i>Neither of which I think</i>
<i>you'll find satisfactory.</i>

41:08.542 --> 41:10.583
<i>Suffice it to say</i>
<i>there is no way</i>

41:10.667 --> 41:13.500
<i>I could have stayed</i>
<i>with your mother and</i>
<i>survived.</i>

41:13.583 --> 41:16.542
<i>In that sense, you're</i>
<i>already stronger than me.</i>

41:19.208 --> 41:22.208
<i>I was a lousy father.</i>

41:22.291 --> 41:25.000
<i>When I got sober enough to</i>
<i>figure out how much I missed</i>

41:25.083 --> 41:27.542
<i>it was too late</i>
<i>to undo the damage.</i>

41:35.208 --> 41:36.917
<i>Much to my regret</i>

41:37.000 --> 41:40.166
<i>I'll always be the dad</i>
<i>who bought you a bike</i>

41:40.250 --> 41:41.917
<i>but never taught you</i>
<i>how to ride it.</i>

41:53.166 --> 41:54.375
<i>There were a few moments</i>

41:54.458 --> 41:55.667
<i>I tried to reconnect</i>

41:55.750 --> 41:57.208
<i>along the way.</i>

41:58.542 --> 42:00.750
<i>But you were</i>
<i>on your own path by then.</i>

42:00.834 --> 42:02.792
<i>Your own woman.</i>

42:02.875 --> 42:05.834
<i>And you turned out great, kid.</i>

42:26.875 --> 42:28.959
<i>I've missed so much</i>
<i>of your life.</i>

42:29.041 --> 42:31.792
<i>For that, I am sorry.</i>

42:31.875 --> 42:34.375
<i>Not only to you,</i>
<i>but for depriving myself</i>

42:34.458 --> 42:38.166
<i>for all those times</i>
<i>you needed a father.</i>

42:38.250 --> 42:40.291
<i>Somebody to protect you.</i>

42:47.125 --> 42:49.166
<i>When you showed up</i>
<i>that day at the park</i>

42:49.250 --> 42:51.125
<i>after all these years later</i>

42:51.208 --> 42:53.125
<i>my heart about</i>
<i>jumped out of my chest.</i>

42:53.208 --> 42:56.542
<i>I thought maybe you came</i>
<i>to judge me till I realized</i>

42:56.625 --> 42:59.792
<i>I'm the only parent</i>
<i>you've got left.</i>

42:59.875 --> 43:01.250
<i>Like it or not..</i>

43:01.333 --> 43:02.625
<i>...you only get one father.</i>

43:24.417 --> 43:27.750
<i>Just know, if there's ever</i>
<i>another moment in your life</i>

43:27.834 --> 43:29.875
<i>when you need me..</i>

43:29.959 --> 43:32.834
<i>...I will be there.</i>
