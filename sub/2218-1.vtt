WEBVTT

01:00.024 --> 01:03.359
I'm gonna have some soup.

01:08.031 --> 01:11.400
I'm gonna go eat dinner.

01:15.373 --> 01:18.806
Come on, I just wanna eat dinner.

03:06.449 --> 03:08.691
Go! Go fast!

03:11.388 --> 03:12.589
Too fast!

03:48.692 --> 03:51.458
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

03:54.332 --> 03:56.857
Hey, it's okay.

04:01.205 --> 04:04.495
I'm gonna get the monster, I promise.

04:28.265 --> 04:31.243
There we go. Hey. Got it.

04:31.343 --> 04:32.635
- You got it?
- Yeah.

04:33.837 --> 04:37.375
- Think you'll ever come back?
- Know what? Nobody's coming back.

04:37.475 --> 04:40.871
It's over with. Gotta get outta here.
You gotta get outta here, too.

04:40.971 --> 04:43.948
Yeah, well, as soon as I get
my car fixed, I'm out of here.

04:44.048 --> 04:46.815
I don't wanna leave, but I wanna live.

04:47.951 --> 04:49.952
Look at this.

04:52.256 --> 04:56.194
I had a wonderful childhood.
So far, I had a wonderful life.

04:56.294 --> 05:00.164
Just... just sad what happened.
Just sad what happened.

05:00.264 --> 05:03.801
See, I used to always sing,
"didn't I blow your mind this time?"

05:03.901 --> 05:07.470
- How does that go like?
- Didn't I blow your mind this time?

05:07.570 --> 05:11.501
Didn't I... Came out in '69.

05:12.009 --> 05:15.176
And, like, "Betcha by golly wow."

05:20.950 --> 05:25.789
I love you, and I'll never forget you.
Be careful. Get out of here while you can.

07:05.855 --> 07:07.990
- Where's Larry?
- He's out in the yard.

07:11.694 --> 07:14.298
It's number one. Look at that.

07:14.398 --> 07:16.434
- Yeah, that's number two.
- Yeah, that's number one, though.

07:16.534 --> 07:18.902
Yeah, but it's mixed,
so it's number two.

07:19.002 --> 07:20.938
- Yeah, well, I'll separate it.
- We'll give you a good price.

07:21.038 --> 07:24.973
Well, that's number-one copper,
so I better get a good price.

08:13.790 --> 08:17.661
I put a sign up here that says,
"Don't let me see your fucking face

08:17.761 --> 08:20.097
near my motherfucking copper!"

08:20.197 --> 08:25.135
This is my fucking copper!
I own this fucking copper!

08:25.235 --> 08:28.539
I own this city! I own this copper!

08:28.639 --> 08:32.443
This is my fucking copper!
I put a sign up here that says,

08:32.543 --> 08:36.714
"don't let me see
your motherfucking face

08:36.813 --> 08:39.183
around here again!"

08:39.283 --> 08:42.986
This is my country! This is my city!
I own this fucking city!

08:43.287 --> 08:45.022
I put a sign up here that says,

08:45.122 --> 08:48.425
"don't let me see
your motherfucking face

08:48.525 --> 08:51.996
around here again!"

08:52.096 --> 08:53.795
Welcome to Bullytown!

10:11.809 --> 10:13.544
Hey.

10:14.278 --> 10:16.311
I'm Dave.

10:25.988 --> 10:29.249
- Where's Carl?
- Carl? He's moved on.

10:29.349 --> 10:34.131
I've been brought in to consolidate
some of these branches.

10:34.231 --> 10:35.949
So...

10:36.700 --> 10:38.700
How can I help?

10:39.769 --> 10:44.108
Carl talked me into this loan.
He told me that...

10:44.208 --> 10:46.343
he could get me into my grandmother's
house for nothing

10:46.443 --> 10:49.713
and that I shouldn't be paying
someone else's mortgage,

10:49.813 --> 10:53.350
and he didn't explain it to me,
and I never understood it.

10:53.450 --> 10:56.361
And then a couple years later, the rates
change entirely, and I... he didn't explain.

10:56.461 --> 10:58.789
Can I just... can I just cut
across you for a moment, there?

10:58.889 --> 11:02.693
Listen, I am all ears, but you're gonna
have to talk up a little bit,

11:02.793 --> 11:05.194
'cause I am very deaf.
This happens to be my good ear,

11:05.294 --> 11:07.757
but all I heard then was...

11:09.366 --> 11:12.670
So, just... whatever it was
you just said,

11:12.770 --> 11:15.903
please, just a little louder.
I can't quite hear it.

11:17.974 --> 11:21.779
I don't think I ever should have
qualified for that loan,

11:21.879 --> 11:24.976
and Carl talked me into that loan.

11:25.282 --> 11:27.582
Can I ask your name?

11:29.619 --> 11:32.623
- Billy.
- Okay, Billy.

11:32.723 --> 11:38.495
We are in the middle
of a very tight fiscal knot,

11:38.595 --> 11:40.931
and it's squeezing,
and you are right in the middle of it.

11:41.031 --> 11:44.602
Now, you could pay your three months.
You can walk away with some money.

11:44.702 --> 11:47.104
You could pay your three months
and then pay more and more,

11:47.204 --> 11:49.039
and yeah, you could keep the house...

11:49.139 --> 11:50.975
- So I can?
- ...if that's really what you wanna do.

11:51.075 --> 11:55.042
Yeah, but what can you do?
What sort of work do you do?

11:57.715 --> 11:59.717
Well, that doesn't sound promising.

12:00.487 --> 12:04.218
I mean, how do you plan to...
Do you have a plan?

12:06.589 --> 12:08.490
See...

12:09.792 --> 12:11.835
I have been to...

12:11.935 --> 12:15.599
six Lost Rivers in the last few years,

12:15.699 --> 12:20.204
and I hear the same story
from folks like you.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.840
Now, I don't know Carl very well.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.275
I only met him for a moment,
and then I fired him.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.711
But in those precious few moments,

12:27.811 --> 12:31.548
you know, he didn't strike me
as an evil financial genius

12:31.648 --> 12:35.886
bent on destroying the American dream
one single mom at a time, okay?

12:35.986 --> 12:38.422
Okay, but I'm actually
not interested in the buyout.

12:38.522 --> 12:43.460
I'd like to just pay the three months
and keep the house and stay in the house.

12:46.162 --> 12:49.063
Do you mind if I ask why?

12:50.333 --> 12:53.070
Because I have two boys,
and that is our home, and...

12:53.170 --> 12:55.539
and I grew up in that home,
and that is our home.

12:56.139 --> 13:01.178
Look, I can make a note for you, right?
I can write a fucking novel.

13:01.278 --> 13:03.295
But at the end of the day,
you're gonna have...

13:03.395 --> 13:05.516
- ...to come up with some of this.
- Okay.

13:05.616 --> 13:07.117
Now, I don't know what you can do,

13:07.217 --> 13:10.220
but you want to have a think
about that very seriously...

13:10.320 --> 13:13.404
what you can do,
what you're willing to do.

13:13.504 --> 13:17.795
And you're a very beautiful lady,
and I don't care what you do.

13:17.895 --> 13:20.263
I'm not what I do.

13:20.649 --> 13:23.133
It's not who I am.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.002
Everyone's gotta do
the shimmy-shimmy-ya.

13:25.102 --> 13:28.706
You know, I got my little hustle.
It's not who I fucking am.

13:28.806 --> 13:32.643
Believe me. But if I were you,

13:32.743 --> 13:36.588
I'd make the payments, walk away
with the money, because I'm telling you,

13:36.688 --> 13:39.116
the wolves,
if they're not already at your door,

13:39.216 --> 13:44.019
they're gonna be there
very fucking soon. Pardon my French.

14:06.288 --> 14:09.914
- What's this?
- It's a job.

14:10.414 --> 14:14.495
- And where is that?
- Well, it's...

14:15.753 --> 14:17.688
Closer than somewhere over the rainbow.

14:17.788 --> 14:20.681
Let's put it that way.
I think you'll like it.

14:58.494 --> 15:02.199
Where were you today?
I called you so many times.

15:02.647 --> 15:04.034
Here.

15:04.134 --> 15:06.967
Were you out stripping houses?

15:09.872 --> 15:11.384
No.

15:12.274 --> 15:14.912
Where were you?

15:15.012 --> 15:16.413
I was at the bank.

15:16.513 --> 15:19.583
Why'd you have to go to the bank?
Are we behind?

15:19.683 --> 15:23.685
No, Bones, we're fine.
Please stop worrying about it.

15:25.988 --> 15:27.222
Love you.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.926
Whisper

16:10.320 --> 16:13.403
That you want me

16:14.600 --> 16:21.085
And I'll love you always

16:21.520 --> 16:27.880
Truly, you will be mine

16:29.160 --> 16:35.088
For eternity

16:40.000 --> 16:42.651
Whisper

16:42.800 --> 16:46.122
That you love me

16:47.000 --> 16:50.841
That you'll never leave me

16:53.240 --> 16:54.446
Be mine

16:55.840 --> 16:58.127
For always

16:59.160 --> 17:05.281
I'll be yours forever

17:05.960 --> 17:10.965
Truly, you will be mine

17:13.660 --> 17:19.130
You will be my baby

17:52.334 --> 17:54.337
- ...that this was going to happen.
- I was not notified!

17:54.437 --> 17:56.506
Do you think I look notified?!

17:57.206 --> 18:00.010
You can't just come in here
and start knocking down houses!

18:00.110 --> 18:02.477
- This neighborhood...
- I live right there! I have kids!

18:10.186 --> 18:14.288
Mommy! Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

18:22.532 --> 18:24.666
Go inside, Franky, okay?

18:32.975 --> 18:35.740
We're not all paid up, are we?

18:36.713 --> 18:38.148
No.

18:38.248 --> 18:40.341
How much?

18:41.718 --> 18:43.667
Three months.

18:49.726 --> 18:52.293
So, what are we gonna do?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.931
I've got it figured out.

19:00.102 --> 19:02.670
I got offered a job.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.842
What kind of job?

19:06.242 --> 19:08.145
I don't know. Dave told me about it.

19:09.016 --> 19:10.847
Who the fuck is Dave?

19:10.947 --> 19:14.117
Dave's the bank manager. Jesus Christ.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.852
I can't fucking do anything right!

20:31.327 --> 20:33.189
Hey! Bones!

20:33.289 --> 20:35.099
Hey!

20:43.191 --> 20:46.406
You better run your fuckin' ass!

22:52.468 --> 22:54.237
Dave?

22:54.337 --> 22:56.853
I'm calling about that job.

23:03.135 --> 23:06.149
Larry, can you weigh my bag?

23:07.174 --> 23:09.686
Man, you can't come in here anymore.

23:10.243 --> 23:12.222
- Look at this stuff. It's number one, okay?
- Yeah, that's a good number one.

23:12.322 --> 23:15.058
- There's about $100 worth in the bag!
- I don't care.

23:15.258 --> 23:17.527
- Why?
- Things ain't like it used to be, man.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.529
Bully running everything now.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.765
You're a dead motherfucker.

23:21.865 --> 23:25.569
You know he caught that boy up there
on St. Mary's... that little Chinese boy?

23:25.669 --> 23:28.809
Cut his goddamn lips off
with a pair of scissors.

23:28.909 --> 23:31.140
You think that motherfucker
look funny in the beginning?

23:31.240 --> 23:35.478
You ought to see him now, Bones.
No more copper. No more you, Bones.

23:35.578 --> 23:39.117
What I don't understand...
all this shit for some goddamn car parts!

23:39.217 --> 23:41.555
It's not about the car parts
this time, okay? I need the money.

23:41.655 --> 23:44.154
They're gonna take the house.

23:44.654 --> 23:47.056
It's the last time, I promise you.
I'll never come back.

23:47.882 --> 23:51.895
I don't wanna say this to you,
but that might be a blessing in disguise.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.863
So maybe you ought to
take that blessing,

23:55.166 --> 23:58.868
head South, don't stop
until you see Palm Trees.

23:58.968 --> 24:02.372
'Cause Bully ain't
no forgivin' person, man.

24:02.672 --> 24:04.205
Head South, man.

24:16.885 --> 24:20.821
You can't even see the woods
from the trees, motherfucker.

24:22.658 --> 24:25.723
The only way to live is like a bull...
to the wind, you know.

24:25.823 --> 24:27.931
When you put a bull
to the wind, you know,

24:28.031 --> 24:31.401
there's something that happens
with his eyes and his horns,

24:31.501 --> 24:33.670
and it's like Bully town.

24:33.770 --> 24:37.573
You got to remember, man,
blood is important to all of us, you know?

24:37.673 --> 24:39.676
You can't cheat death.
You can't cheat life.

24:39.876 --> 24:42.245
You can't cheat anything, really.

24:42.445 --> 24:44.879
You never wanna let people down.

24:47.149 --> 24:49.069
You let him go?

24:55.924 --> 24:57.377
Hey!

25:19.681 --> 25:22.316
Can I watch your TV?

25:24.152 --> 25:27.197
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.740
I dreamed I was a knight.

25:36.840 --> 25:41.379
With my armor and my horse,
I went out to fight a dragon.

25:47.450 --> 25:51.180
Try to buy some chops
and he could really cook your steak, bud.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.180
Let me tell you, boy.

25:53.280 --> 25:58.022
He was a mean dragon
from the very word of go.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.220
I found a road that goes underwater.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.945
Where?

26:06.280 --> 26:08.009
Behind the old zoo.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.345
Must go down to that town.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.743
What town?

26:16.280 --> 26:20.170
You know, the town
at the bottom of the reservoir.

26:22.345 --> 26:26.558
- That's crazy. What does that mean?
- It's not really that crazy.

26:27.984 --> 26:31.715
They flooded a bunch of towns
when they dammed the river.

26:31.815 --> 26:34.888
That's why they call this Lost River.

26:37.059 --> 26:39.126
I have a movie about it.

26:40.996 --> 26:44.230
- A movie?
- Yeah.

26:45.201 --> 26:48.569
Like an educational film or something.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.008
You really never heard about it?

26:56.211 --> 26:58.012
No.

26:59.314 --> 27:02.352
My grandmother used to live there.

27:02.652 --> 27:05.219
She hasn't been the same ever since.

27:07.923 --> 27:10.190
No one has.

27:14.262 --> 27:17.634
As soon as the last town was drowned...

27:17.734 --> 27:21.168
an evil spell was cast on Lost River.

27:24.740 --> 27:28.007
- Think you're making it up.
- I'm not.

27:30.812 --> 27:34.818
That's why this whole place feels
like it's underwater, too.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.051
It's true.

27:44.793 --> 27:49.118
Makes sense... everything
that's going on around here.

27:50.133 --> 27:52.800
It's got to be for some reason.

28:21.631 --> 28:23.679
The old way...

28:25.201 --> 28:27.271
it works.

28:30.139 --> 28:33.676
- Do you want some paper towel?
- Yeah, please.

28:33.776 --> 28:35.679
- Sorry for that.
- I have it for that very reason.

28:35.779 --> 28:38.481
It's not the five-star service, but...

28:38.581 --> 28:40.881
I'm a mother.
I can pull anything out of this bag.

28:42.251 --> 28:44.085
Well, I'm not your child.

28:48.256 --> 28:52.128
You might be very tired,
so you can make yourself comfortable,

28:52.228 --> 28:55.365
and I'll let you to sleep.

28:55.565 --> 28:58.701
I just wake you up when we arrive.

28:58.801 --> 29:03.904
Please, feel like home,
and take this moment of rest.

29:16.685 --> 29:18.385
We're here.

29:37.105 --> 29:38.942
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

29:39.042 --> 29:42.545
this is the moment
you've all been itching for.

29:42.645 --> 29:45.548
Coming to our stage
is a lady of letters,

29:45.648 --> 29:50.150
a woman not of substance,
but above-stance.

29:52.087 --> 29:55.291
The 8th, 9th, and 10th wonders
of the world.

29:55.391 --> 29:59.413
Now, you may recognize her
from "sadissmo," "burn, baby, burn,"

29:59.513 --> 30:01.794
"the violent ones," or...

30:01.894 --> 30:04.734
or her stage production,

30:04.834 --> 30:06.969
"the beautiful,
the bloody, and the bare."

30:07.469 --> 30:11.040
Please put your hands together
for the delightful, the delicious,

30:11.140 --> 30:14.875
and the de-lovely,
pretty miss Kitty Cat!

30:23.288 --> 30:28.233
<i>Cuando la tarde languidece
renacen las sombras</i>

30:28.333 --> 30:33.398
<i>Y en la quietud
los cafetales vuelven a sentir</i>

30:33.498 --> 30:38.438
<i>Esta tristón canción de amor
de la vieja molienda</i>

30:38.538 --> 30:43.014
<i>En el letargo de la noche parece gemir</i>

30:43.614 --> 30:46.676
<i>Cuando la tarde languidece
renacen las sombras</i>

30:46.776 --> 30:49.577
I got some fans tonight.
I got some fans. Okay.

30:49.677 --> 30:53.578
<i>...cafetales vuelven a sentir</i>

30:53.678 --> 30:58.738
<i>Esta tristón canción de amor
de la vieja molienda</i>

30:58.838 --> 31:03.405
<i>En el letargo de la noche parece gemir</i>

31:04.301 --> 31:08.829
<i>Una pena de amor, una tristeza</i>

31:09.606 --> 31:13.756
<i>Lleva el zambo Manuel en su amargura</i>

31:14.356 --> 31:17.186
<i>Pasa incansable la noche moliendo café</i>

31:26.715 --> 31:28.082
Oh, my gosh!

31:31.553 --> 31:32.753
Yeah!

31:41.663 --> 31:43.631
Rise, rise, rise!

31:49.437 --> 31:51.939
And pay respects to the goddess of Gore!

32:21.937 --> 32:25.641
Maybe, maybe, yes.
Now I feel like a goddess.

32:25.741 --> 32:29.458
So, I'm okay with it. Plus, I love
my boobs. They're, like, my fave.

32:29.558 --> 32:32.148
Cat? Cat, Billy's here to see you.

32:32.248 --> 32:35.017
- Who's Billy?
- It's a Dave situation.

32:35.417 --> 32:37.730
Oh, shit, I knew it.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.354
- Hi. Have a seat.
- Okay.

32:45.727 --> 32:48.865
You like that stuff...
blood, guts, torture?

32:49.065 --> 32:50.967
Is that what you're into?

32:51.367 --> 32:52.802
- Fanny.
- Yeah.

32:52.902 --> 32:54.804
You chipped my tooth.

32:55.604 --> 32:57.971
You chipped my tooth.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.474
Oh, sorry, Cat.

33:04.945 --> 33:07.491
Billy, what's your act?

33:07.591 --> 33:09.886
- I don't have an act.
- You don't have an act?

33:09.986 --> 33:12.188
- You juggle?
- No.

33:12.704 --> 33:14.546
- Tap dance?
- No.

33:16.158 --> 33:18.627
Ever pull a rabbit out of your hat?

33:18.727 --> 33:19.762
No.

33:20.598 --> 33:22.222
- How's your scream?
- My scream?

33:22.322 --> 33:23.966
Yeah.

33:24.732 --> 33:26.901
Like, for bloody murder.
I mean, a scream, you know...

33:30.039 --> 33:32.773
I'm so sorry I'm late, grandma.

33:45.854 --> 33:47.754
Grandma?

33:51.526 --> 33:53.327
Grandma?

33:58.433 --> 34:01.534
Hey. Hi, grandma.

34:12.148 --> 34:13.480
Sorry, grandma.

34:26.194 --> 34:28.262
There he is.

34:50.252 --> 34:52.752
You got to go to sleep.

34:58.126 --> 35:00.213
Go to sleep.

35:00.796 --> 35:02.830
Go to sleep.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.504
Up here.

38:00.675 --> 38:04.980
Engineers planned this out
to the last detail. And look at it go!

38:05.080 --> 38:08.039
Filling the valley up
like a sink from a faucet.

38:08.139 --> 38:11.420
Sure, we might be losing
our famous prehistoric theme park,

38:11.520 --> 38:15.657
- but we're gaining a brand-new reservoir.
- A reser-what?

38:15.757 --> 38:19.028
It's a lake,
made right where you need it.

38:19.128 --> 38:22.765
So that's how we all work together
to help our town grow.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.167
And just because you may need
to leave your house

38:25.267 --> 38:30.203
and all its old bricks and boards
and nails... that's not a bad thing.

38:30.303 --> 38:33.442
You're in a brand-new home
with your family, because...?

38:33.542 --> 38:36.745
- A family makes a home.
- You said it, Bobby.

38:36.845 --> 38:39.713
A family makes a home.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.010
That's her.

38:56.499 --> 38:59.065
That's her in the movie.

39:03.971 --> 39:05.829
Is that your grandfather?

39:05.929 --> 39:10.213
Yeah. He died during
the construction of the dam.

39:10.813 --> 39:13.880
She hasn't spoken ever since.

39:18.619 --> 39:21.621
Now you believe me about the spell?

39:26.227 --> 39:28.061
No.

39:34.836 --> 39:36.754
Well, you know,

39:36.854 --> 39:40.974
the only way to break it
is to bring a piece to the surface.

40:26.688 --> 40:30.389
They like burning houses here.

40:30.959 --> 40:33.459
It is like a game.

40:42.370 --> 40:44.177
You know,

40:44.277 --> 40:48.610
in my country, in my place,
when you heard about America,

40:48.710 --> 40:53.524
everybody say,
"there's so much money there," and...

40:53.624 --> 40:58.387
"you're gonna have a big car,
big house, and a swimming pool,"

40:58.487 --> 41:02.391
and... and, "you're gonna catch
the money on the floor

41:02.491 --> 41:05.661
and just have to take it
and pick it up."

41:06.461 --> 41:08.997
And finally it's different.

41:09.097 --> 41:13.635
But you realize when you arrive here,

41:13.735 --> 41:15.671
it's different.

41:15.771 --> 41:21.006
So, everybody's looking for
a better life somewhere. It's like that.

41:23.579 --> 41:26.281
And maybe we'll find some...

41:27.033 --> 41:29.716
- one day.
- Yeah.

41:53.641 --> 41:57.546
Where you're working doesn't
seem friendly. Will you be okay?

41:57.646 --> 41:59.681
I'll be fine.

42:00.106 --> 42:02.518
How about you?

42:02.618 --> 42:04.418
I'm fine.

42:08.257 --> 42:11.627
And tomorrow morning, when you
wake up to find blood on your pillow,

42:11.727 --> 42:14.729
you'll wonder
if it was all just a dream.

42:14.829 --> 42:19.896
But you'll know exactly where you were
when you get your credit-card bill.

42:20.435 --> 42:22.771
I don't really know what it is,
but I like it.

42:22.871 --> 42:26.876
Well, it's a place for people
to get wild for the night.

42:27.376 --> 42:29.109
Fuck being polite.

42:30.585 --> 42:33.649
It's something I do every time I come
to one of these towns that's imploding.

42:33.749 --> 42:37.684
I set up one of these clubs.
People come here. They have a good time.

42:43.236 --> 42:47.596
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Get me a band-aid.
I need a band-aid to the stage.

42:47.996 --> 42:51.231
I'm gonna have Cat,
show you around after her act.

43:00.341 --> 43:03.076
Thank you so much.

43:34.508 --> 43:36.278
You can make some good bread
doing the shows,

43:36.378 --> 43:39.348
but down here
is where you get it buttered.

43:39.448 --> 43:42.516
- What are they called?
- Shells.

44:02.737 --> 44:05.007
You just get in there, and then what?

44:05.107 --> 44:09.478
That's it.
All you have to do is be in there.

44:09.578 --> 44:11.613
They just wanna be able
to let out their frustrations

44:11.713 --> 44:15.509
and not worry about hurting anyone.

44:15.609 --> 44:17.663
Is it dangerous?

44:18.760 --> 44:21.624
If the door's locked, you're fine.

44:22.024 --> 44:25.428
Yeah. Door's locked, you're good.

44:26.428 --> 44:28.931
How much does it pay?

44:29.031 --> 44:30.730
It pays the rent.

44:34.735 --> 44:38.305
- Do you get a commission?
- Off this? Yeah.

44:40.352 --> 44:41.808
Does that make you feel uncomfortable?

45:49.877 --> 45:51.811
Good night.

46:09.463 --> 46:11.185
Hey.

46:12.300 --> 46:15.701
Put on something fancy.
We're going out on the town.

46:23.277 --> 46:26.715
- What are you doing?
- I'm going out.

46:26.815 --> 46:28.684
You have to watch Franky.

46:29.184 --> 46:31.386
Can you watch him?

46:31.486 --> 46:34.053
I got to go to work!

46:38.292 --> 46:39.793
Please?

46:41.595 --> 46:45.867
Why would you steal something from Bully?
Why would you do something that stupid?

46:45.967 --> 46:48.132
'Cause it was mine.

46:48.232 --> 46:51.373
- You can't steal from a guy like that.
- Fuck, he stole from me. I mean...

46:51.473 --> 46:53.475
Whether you stole from him
or he stole from you,

46:53.575 --> 46:56.278
he's still gonna cut your head off.

46:57.878 --> 46:59.880
He's trouble.

47:02.184 --> 47:03.750
He'll hurt you.

47:58.172 --> 48:01.543
- Why don't you just get out of here?
- What do you mean?

48:01.643 --> 48:04.079
Why don't you just
get out of this place?

48:04.179 --> 48:06.946
What's keeping you here?
You've got your car.

48:13.587 --> 48:15.657
I mean, my mom...

48:15.757 --> 48:19.758
still feels attached
to the house, and Franky.

48:21.028 --> 48:24.232
Is that what's keeping you here?

48:24.532 --> 48:27.033
Your mom and Franky?

48:36.810 --> 48:39.714
I don't know. What else...

48:40.715 --> 48:43.281
What else do I have?

48:46.388 --> 48:48.256
What about you?

48:48.356 --> 48:50.593
What about me?

48:51.293 --> 48:53.514
What if something happened,

48:53.614 --> 48:55.876
and we had to leave tomorrow?

48:55.976 --> 48:58.433
Would you come? Would you leave?

48:58.533 --> 49:01.536
- Me and you?
- Yeah, me and you.

49:01.636 --> 49:03.534
Maybe.

49:07.808 --> 49:10.879
- More blood.
- Big heart.

49:10.979 --> 49:12.848
Big blood heart.

49:12.948 --> 49:14.616
- Big blood heart.
- Hello.

49:14.716 --> 49:16.451
Yeah, the kid's here.

49:16.551 --> 49:17.686
- She is.
- This is the most beautiful heart...

49:17.786 --> 49:20.622
- ...I've ever seen in my whole life.
- Okay.

49:21.122 --> 49:24.793
Billy, Dave would like to speak to you
after you're done with your act.

49:24.893 --> 49:26.628
It's okay. I'll watch him.

49:27.703 --> 49:29.764
We're having so much fun.

49:30.064 --> 49:31.266
Say it. Say it. Look, look.

49:31.366 --> 49:33.101
- It's okay.
- So she doesn't worry, say,

49:33.401 --> 49:35.403
- "mama..."
- Mama.

49:35.503 --> 49:38.807
- "...we're having a bloody good time."
- We have a "bundy" good time.

49:38.907 --> 49:41.376
Yes, we are... bloody good.

49:41.592 --> 49:43.366
- Bloody good.
- Bloody good.

49:43.466 --> 49:45.579
- That's right.
- That's right.

49:45.679 --> 49:48.179
- Bloody, bloody good.
- Bloody, bloody good.

49:48.279 --> 49:50.618
Yes, we are.

49:50.718 --> 49:52.118
Yes, we are.

51:37.731 --> 51:40.428
- What?
- Something like that there.

51:40.528 --> 51:42.297
Something like that.

51:42.397 --> 51:45.600
And you're just... you're just like...

51:45.700 --> 51:49.302
- I don't know.
- Who cares? How much can you get?

51:53.707 --> 51:56.208
Go. Hide.

52:12.959 --> 52:16.798
- What's your name?
- Marylou, but they call Me mama Aris.

52:16.898 --> 52:20.201
- I said, "what's your name?"
- Marylou!

52:20.301 --> 52:24.181
- But they call me Mary Aris.
- I said, "what's your name?"

52:25.681 --> 52:27.809
- Lady, what's your name? What's your name?
- I told you!

52:27.909 --> 52:30.872
And you're not gonna... and you just...
and you're just not gonna answer me.

52:30.972 --> 52:34.582
- What's your name?
- Marylou! Call me Mama Aris!

52:34.682 --> 52:37.683
Now, what they call you, "busybody?

52:45.960 --> 52:50.165
"Ryan's hope." "Guiding light."

52:50.265 --> 52:53.501
"Search for tomorrow."
"General hospital."

52:53.601 --> 52:55.403
What, you're not gonna
say nothing to me?

52:55.503 --> 52:58.006
- That I love you, baby.
- I just asked you to dance with me.

52:58.106 --> 53:03.211
- You're not gonna even answer me...
- I love you. Love to cut your head off.

53:04.022 --> 53:07.580
Hey, lady, come on, come on!
Just put her in there.

53:09.743 --> 53:12.603
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's... that's it.

53:12.703 --> 53:14.456
That'll be $1, please.

53:14.556 --> 53:17.058
Don't touch my seat.

53:17.458 --> 53:20.295
- I'm sorry.
- Nobody sits in that seat.

53:20.395 --> 53:22.464
- But who?
- But me.

53:22.564 --> 53:23.865
Okay.

53:23.965 --> 53:27.068
Are you with that man over there?

53:27.368 --> 53:29.495
- No.
- No?

53:29.595 --> 53:31.459
Okay.

53:34.775 --> 53:36.142
Go hide. Hide.

54:02.002 --> 54:03.836
Hey.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.774
What's your name?

54:10.245 --> 54:12.047
Rat.

54:12.447 --> 54:13.915
Rat?

54:14.015 --> 54:15.884
Yeah.

54:16.384 --> 54:18.252
Why?

54:19.554 --> 54:22.921
- Why is my name Rat?
- Yeah.

54:24.591 --> 54:28.494
- 'Cause I've got a pet rat.
- Oh, yeah?

54:29.697 --> 54:31.720
What's his name?

54:32.634 --> 54:36.638
- Nick.
- Nick the rat?

54:37.438 --> 54:39.541
Hello! Hallelujah!

54:39.641 --> 54:43.804
Look at me, man!
You look so ugly, dawg. God!

54:43.904 --> 54:47.054
One, two, three, four.

54:50.384 --> 54:52.520
Are you waiting for somebody?

54:52.620 --> 54:55.976
- I'm alone.
- Oh, yeah?

55:09.970 --> 55:12.240
Want a ride home?

55:13.031 --> 55:17.143
No, I'm all right.
I'm pretty close to here, so...

55:18.712 --> 55:20.616
Okay.

55:21.316 --> 55:24.077
I gotta take a piss anyway.

55:28.709 --> 55:30.951
I'm going in.

55:33.226 --> 55:35.248
Wait.

55:37.369 --> 55:40.201
Actually, yeah.
I'll... I'll... I'll take that ride.

55:40.901 --> 55:44.090
- It's dark.
- Yeah.

55:44.372 --> 55:46.772
- You got to be safe, right?
- Yeah.

55:50.043 --> 55:53.681
- This is my friend Face.
- Hi.

55:53.781 --> 55:57.018
You wanna know why he's called Face?

55:58.319 --> 56:00.955
You wanna know why?

56:01.055 --> 56:02.889
Why?

56:06.127 --> 56:08.193
Face?

56:11.065 --> 56:14.302
Get in the car. Come on.
It's the best seat in the house.

56:14.402 --> 56:16.838
You can see the world from up here.

56:16.938 --> 56:19.637
Rat, Face, and Bully.

56:40.361 --> 56:42.563
Can I touch your hair?

56:42.663 --> 56:45.967
Can I just reach... can I reach...
can I reach out for a second?

56:46.067 --> 56:48.063
Oh, my God.

56:48.970 --> 56:53.107
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come to me.
Come to me. Give me that. Give me that.

56:53.207 --> 56:55.490
Oh. Come here.

56:56.544 --> 56:59.079
I wanna smell it.

57:03.388 --> 57:07.003
Billy, we're never gonna be friends
if you sit so far from me

57:07.103 --> 57:10.308
- and I can't hear you... one good ear.
- Sorry.

57:10.408 --> 57:12.060
- There it is.
- Get your free drink,

57:12.160 --> 57:14.762
and when you do, you put
your hand inside of your pocket,

57:14.862 --> 57:16.631
and you leave lots of money
for that waitress,

57:16.731 --> 57:19.743
because she's here
just for you and you and you.

57:19.843 --> 57:22.501
- You brought your kid.
- We'll be right back.

57:27.006 --> 57:29.936
Did you bring your kid here?

57:32.379 --> 57:34.045
I got stuck, and I'm sorry.

57:34.145 --> 57:37.215
It's not very sexy, is it?

57:39.653 --> 57:43.224
- It won't happen again.
- Don't do it again.

57:43.624 --> 57:48.345
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands
together for our host this evening...

57:48.445 --> 57:50.697
Dave! Dave, ladies and gentleman.

57:50.797 --> 57:56.137
Come on. Feel the light. Feel it, Dave.
Come to me. Don't think, just stand.

57:56.237 --> 57:59.307
Stand and deliver, Dave! Come!

57:59.946 --> 58:02.477
- I'm gonna be your ride tonight.
- Come, now.

58:02.577 --> 58:07.313
Tonight, no man should feel so much pleasure
than this man should feel right now.

58:14.320 --> 58:16.657
Hello. Hello.

58:16.757 --> 58:20.161
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome the sultan of surprises,

58:20.261 --> 58:25.463
your host tonight,
the one, the only, Dave.

58:27.366 --> 58:29.814
Stop it.

58:33.306 --> 58:36.711
There are some basic human needs.

58:36.811 --> 58:40.882
We try to cater to some of them.
We can't get all of them.

58:40.982 --> 58:43.869
This is about one of them.

58:53.560 --> 58:58.780
All day I've faced a barren waste

58:58.880 --> 59:03.780
Without the taste of water

59:03.880 --> 59:08.749
Cool water

59:10.620 --> 59:15.560
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry

59:15.660 --> 59:23.209
And souls that cry for water

59:26.240 --> 59:31.137
Cool, clear

59:31.237 --> 59:34.460
Water

59:36.520 --> 59:40.700
Keep on moving, Dan
Don't you listen to him, Dan

59:40.800 --> 59:43.300
He's a devil, not a man

59:43.400 --> 59:48.791
He spreads the burning sand with water

59:51.040 --> 59:55.459
Dan, can you see that big green tree

59:55.559 --> 59:57.838
Where the water's running free

59:57.938 --> 01:00:02.823
And it's waiting there for me and you?

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.786
Cool, clear

01:00:10.886 --> 01:00:13.870
Water

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.860
Keep on moving, Dan
Don't you listen to him, Dan

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.700
He's a devil, not a man

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.861
He spreads the burning sand with water

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.084
Dan, can you see that big green tree

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.460
Where the water's running free

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.608
And it's waiting there for me and you?

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.980
Clear

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.060
Clear water

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.520
Water

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.662
Cool

01:01:07.762 --> 01:01:09.864
Clear

01:01:09.964 --> 01:01:12.064
Water

01:01:27.046 --> 01:01:30.215
I need a drink after that one.

01:01:34.454 --> 01:01:38.723
By the way, he's also available
for children's parties.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.807
Thank you.

01:01:52.907 --> 01:01:54.794
I'll walk you to the door.

01:02:14.495 --> 01:02:16.064
Is that your rat?

01:02:17.164 --> 01:02:19.998
I thought I saw it in the car.

01:02:22.368 --> 01:02:23.335
Oh, yeah.

01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:26.639
Could I see it?

01:02:50.196 --> 01:02:52.764
Can I touch it?

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:11.617
Soft.

01:03:14.954 --> 01:03:19.224
Anybody ever touch your rat? No?

01:03:20.593 --> 01:03:23.094
That's the first time?

01:03:30.971 --> 01:03:32.446
Nick!

01:03:33.907 --> 01:03:35.815
No!

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:38.679
Nick!

01:03:38.779 --> 01:03:41.449
Nick, I'm sorry.

01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:44.150
I love you. I love you.

01:03:45.552 --> 01:03:48.034
Say hi to Bones.

01:03:56.396 --> 01:03:59.539
Hey! Hey! Hey.

01:04:06.005 --> 01:04:08.276
I'm sorry.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:10.642
I'm so sorry.

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.603
So, that's it?
That's what all the fuss is about?

01:04:35.703 --> 01:04:37.739
That's it.

01:04:39.402 --> 01:04:42.309
Well... want me to help tuck him in?

01:04:42.409 --> 01:04:47.211
No, I'm... I'm good.
He's already halfway there.

01:04:48.482 --> 01:04:50.519
Well...

01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:53.719
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

01:04:56.556 --> 01:04:59.065
I've got my boy.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.521
Listen...

01:05:02.663 --> 01:05:07.494
I really want to keep my house,
but I don't want to give you the wrong idea.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:11.556
Speaking of which,

01:05:11.656 --> 01:05:14.479
I hate to ask you, but...

01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:17.845
Can you tell me when I can expect
my first paycheck?

01:05:18.845 --> 01:05:21.695
Oh, you'll get it
a week after you started.

01:05:21.795 --> 01:05:24.521
If you wanna make real money
in the meantime, you go down to the shells.

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:28.839
You get to keep...
everything you make down there.

01:05:28.939 --> 01:05:31.249
You've seen the shells, right?

01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:34.754
Yeah. I'm a little bit
claustrophobic, though,

01:05:34.854 --> 01:05:38.382
so I might have a problem. I'm not sure.

01:05:38.482 --> 01:05:40.868
Yeah, well, I have a problem,
too, you know?

01:05:41.531 --> 01:05:45.072
I like to fuck. That's my problem.

01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:50.278
And when I meet a bad bitch,
it drives me crazy.

01:05:50.678 --> 01:05:54.249
Now, really, really...

01:05:55.049 --> 01:05:57.347
Think about it.

01:06:09.896 --> 01:06:13.446
That's my other boy. I got to go...

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:27.274
Don't you want that kid
to have a father? Right.

01:07:27.374 --> 01:07:29.710
You should want that kid
to have a father.

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:33.378
Right. He need a father,
that little kid.

01:07:34.548 --> 01:07:37.151
Nice father like me.

01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:39.620
Right. You can't beat that.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.490
He'd... he'd grow up
and be sharp and everything,

01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:47.127
and all the young ladies
would love to get to know him,

01:07:47.227 --> 01:07:49.630
right, if he dressed like me. Right.

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.933
I'd have him dressing like me,
lookin' like a million bucks,

01:07:53.033 --> 01:07:57.295
you know, looking like his picture should be
on the million-dollar bill. That's right.

01:07:57.395 --> 01:07:59.706
'Cause that's the way I look every day.

01:07:59.806 --> 01:08:02.941
Right, I look like my picture
should be on the million-dollar bill.

01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:06.847
I got on these pretty shoes,

01:08:06.947 --> 01:08:10.684
and you mean to tell me
you ignoring a gentleman like me.

01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:14.352
Boy, what the world's coming to.

01:08:15.956 --> 01:08:19.290
He's funny? He's funny.

01:09:20.353 --> 01:09:22.356
So, this is where you work?

01:09:22.456 --> 01:09:24.892
Yeah, this is where I work.

01:09:24.992 --> 01:09:27.225
Thanks for the lift.

01:11:53.573 --> 01:11:56.343
Hey, are you Bones?

01:11:56.443 --> 01:12:00.247
- Yeah.
- Hi. Are you looking for your mom?

01:12:00.447 --> 01:12:03.750
Yeah. She... she forgot her purse.

01:12:04.479 --> 01:12:06.314
Oh, okay.

01:12:06.414 --> 01:12:10.955
I can... I can take it up to her.
She's actually getting ready for a show.

01:12:12.024 --> 01:12:15.227
There's no boys allowed. Sorry.
So I'll get it right to her.

01:12:17.396 --> 01:12:21.335
- I promise, I'll take it right up.
- Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

01:12:22.135 --> 01:12:24.668
Bye, Bones.

01:12:57.871 --> 01:12:59.704
Danger. Please lock shell.

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.111
Danger. Please lock shell.

01:13:54.593 --> 01:13:57.932
- Can you watch Franky for me?
- Why?

01:13:59.232 --> 01:14:02.133
'Cause I'm gonna break the spell.

01:14:06.639 --> 01:14:09.372
Go inside, Franky, okay?

01:14:11.744 --> 01:14:13.078
Bye.

01:14:18.617 --> 01:14:20.185
I knew it.

01:17:15.148 --> 01:17:18.339
Sure, we might be losing
our famous prehistoric theme park,

01:17:18.439 --> 01:17:20.834
but we're gaining a brand-new reservoir.

01:17:20.934 --> 01:17:22.502
A reser-what?

01:17:22.902 --> 01:17:26.672
It's a lake,
made right where you need it.

01:19:28.928 --> 01:19:32.764
Client is ready.
Please get in shell and lock door.

01:19:35.701 --> 01:19:37.868
Shell locked.

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.851
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:22:04.951 --> 01:22:08.319
Please enjoy and play safe.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.850
I know you want this dick.

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:46.450
You can have this dick.

01:23:53.525 --> 01:23:56.160
- Shell unlocked.
- No! Stop!

01:24:03.968 --> 01:24:07.874
Shell locked. Shell unlocked.

01:24:08.574 --> 01:24:11.044
Shell locked. Shell unlocked.

01:24:11.144 --> 01:24:13.077
- Shell locked.
- You can have this dick.

01:24:14.579 --> 01:24:16.497
Danger. Please lock shell.

01:24:30.162 --> 01:24:32.365
Grandma!

01:24:32.465 --> 01:24:34.668
Grandma?!

01:24:35.068 --> 01:24:37.303
Grandma?

01:24:37.603 --> 01:24:39.939
Franky, come here!

01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:42.239
Grandma!

01:24:44.142 --> 01:24:45.845
Grandma!

01:24:46.813 --> 01:24:48.849
Grandma?

01:24:49.515 --> 01:24:51.548
Grandma?

01:24:56.889 --> 01:24:58.689
Grandma!

01:24:59.759 --> 01:25:01.852
Grandma?!

01:25:02.528 --> 01:25:05.531
Please stop. Please get up.

01:25:05.631 --> 01:25:07.533
Please, grandma!

01:25:07.633 --> 01:25:10.835
Grandma, please get up! Grandma.

01:27:07.886 --> 01:27:10.087
Franky!

01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:17.595
Rat?!

01:27:20.565 --> 01:27:23.934
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

01:27:26.805 --> 01:27:29.373
- Are you okay?
- Bones!

01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:35.245
- Hey.
- Hey, Franky.

01:28:18.022 --> 01:28:19.525
You're so strong.

01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:22.362
- I wanna go in the front of the cab.
- Okay. Come on. Let's go.

01:28:22.462 --> 01:28:24.709
- Can I close the door?
- You wanna close the door?

01:28:24.809 --> 01:28:27.085
- Yeah.
- This is your cab, okay?

01:28:27.185 --> 01:28:30.334
- Am I going to close it?
- Yeah, yeah. I close the door.

01:30:33.693 --> 01:30:35.862
Tell me...

01:30:36.362 --> 01:30:39.363
That you'll kiss me...

01:30:39.865 --> 01:30:41.998
Forever.
