WEBVTT

01:28.922 --> 01:31.508
You-- You were supposed to be the one.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.887
You were supposed to be the one
in the pod, not her.

01:34.887 --> 01:38.182
Why did you put her in the pod?
Why did you put her in the pod?

01:39.474 --> 01:41.185
<i>Idolatry will feed his sickness.</i>

01:41.185 --> 01:42.895
<i>Idolatry will feed his sickness.
Second Foundation...</i>

01:42.895 --> 01:44.855
<i>She's not gonna talk to you, is she?</i>

01:44.855 --> 01:48.233
<i>You would believe her.
She solved the last puzzle.</i>

01:50.194 --> 01:51.987
<i>She solved the last puzzle.</i>

01:51.987 --> 01:57.159
Gods made wine to compensate
those who cannot afford revenge.

01:58.243 --> 02:04.458
The gods made knives to satisfy those
who can't digest your grandest plan.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.542
I have a plan.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.836
You wouldn't have changed
your precious Plan, Hari, don't lie.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.465
<i>If you told me,
you-you'd never have changed your Plan.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.175
Yes, but the Radiant can't predict,

02:13.175 --> 02:15.636
can't account for the--
the actions of individuals.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.095
It's not my fault. It's not my fault.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.639
You know nothing.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.808
You wanna be in control? You know nothing!

02:22.309 --> 02:25.771
You're nothing but a petulant child.

02:25.771 --> 02:30.859
If you shared your great Plan with people,

02:30.859 --> 02:33.237
maybe they could help you.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.031
You saw what happened to me on the <i>Raven</i>.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.534
<i>There's an old saying.</i>

02:38.534 --> 02:44.289
<i>Any man can be a success,
but it takes a madman to be great.</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:46.792
Something's happening.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.044
Something's happening.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.849
My name is Salvor Hardin.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.895
I'm your daughter.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.191
I don't have a daughter.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.694
Are you Gaal Dornick?

03:14.444 --> 03:15.654
Then I've got an update

03:15.654 --> 03:19.491
about a certain embryo you may
or may not remember donating.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
Oh, gods.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.081
Time? I-I-- I was in cryosleep, I--

03:26.081 --> 03:27.165
Yeah, me too.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.336
Guess we both slept our way
into the future.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.922
How old are you? Biologically?

03:34.506 --> 03:35.716
Older than you, I'd wager.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.969
Salvor Hardin.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.390
- Mari Hardin.
- Carried me.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.730
Raised me.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.986
But I was always yours. I think.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.947
I sort of know things.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.784
Like, I knew to come here to find you.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.787
Did you come here to find me?
Maybe you heard a voice calling you, or--

04:06.371 --> 04:07.372
No.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.252
I'm sorry. Let's start over.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.880
Okay.

04:17.548 --> 04:22.554
What do I call you?
'Cause "Mom" feels a little loaded.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.891
How about just "Gaal"? For now.

04:25.891 --> 04:30.521
Okay. Then tell me about you, Gaal.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.983
How you got those scars in your cheeks.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.862
Tell me about my father, Raych.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.698
How those rings above us got there.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.326
Tell me everything.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.083
<i>As waters rise, territories shrink.</i>

04:51.625 --> 04:55.963
<i>That's what happened on Synnax,
and that's what happened with Empire.</i>

04:56.964 --> 04:59.591
<i>Day by day, decade by decade,</i>

04:59.591 --> 05:04.429
<i>the First Foundation nibbled away
planets from edges of Empire.</i>

05:04.930 --> 05:08.183
<i>And Empire steadily contracted.</i>

05:21.280 --> 05:22.489
Harder, Empire!

05:22.489 --> 05:25.909
- Please.
- No. Just be you. Your voice.

05:26.952 --> 05:27.953
Yes, Empire.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.581
Not Empire.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.668
Cleon. Cleon.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.752
Yeah.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.261
I'm close. Yeah.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.305
I'm with you.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.232
Open your eyes, Cleon. Look at me.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.736
If you think you can breach my aura--

07:41.211 --> 07:42.379
Cleon.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.256
Demerzel.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.652
Empire has received a blaster shot
to his left deltoid

08:05.652 --> 08:07.571
and penetrating thoracic trauma.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.033
A nanotoxin was delivered
via molecular blade.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.661
We have 12 seconds before edema
leads to brain stem death. Give it to me.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.876
Empire will recover. Stabilize him.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.838
If he asks, tell him I needed mending.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.352
It's you again.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.787
Hari?

10:34.843 --> 10:39.389
3D object. 2D shadow. Smart boy.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.682
Smart?

10:46.647 --> 10:47.731
I paid for that book.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.326
Three-dimensional shadow.
Four-dimensional object.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.537
Four-dimensional space.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.630
Yanna?

12:34.630 --> 12:36.173
My love.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.799
But you're dead.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.884
So are you.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.687
I've missed you.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.822
Yanna, the galaxy, it's-- it's breaking.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.492
Something's breaking the future.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.869
Maybe I-- I need to fix it.

13:06.662 --> 13:07.996
I need your help.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.916
Oh, my soul,
I wish you weren't just a dream.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.628
I'd find some moonlight to irritate you.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.172
You have doubts.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.300
I am real.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.931
Prove it.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.561
You'd let me make the case for myself.

13:33.689 --> 13:37.234
Premise one, that implies statement two.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.278
Step-by-step.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.363
One, two, three.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.240
QED.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.536
You're not Yanna. I know my life-mate.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.080
Who are you really?

13:50.581 --> 13:51.999
The way you're speaking, I--

13:51.999 --> 13:53.292
You like work.

13:54.918 --> 13:55.919
Work it out.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.797
Free your mind.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.475
Salvor!

14:19.610 --> 14:20.861
Salvor.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.345
What were you doing in there?
I thought you drowned.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.763
I thought you drowned.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.641
I wake up early.

14:51.934 --> 14:56.647
I have this instinct to walk
the perimeter wherever I am.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.567
So I took your boat, did some bowfishing.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.861
Fish here practically volunteer.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.279
I'm sorry.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.614
I panicked.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.116
I have dreams sometimes.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.285
About things that will happen.

15:11.995 --> 15:12.871
You dreamt the future?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.457
I think I can feel the future.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.920
That's funny 'cause I have dreams
about the past.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.173
<i>Your past.</i>

15:23.173 --> 15:24.758
I guess we have that in common.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.469
Both sleep like shit.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.054
It's not really the same thing.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.139
Right.

15:32.558 --> 15:33.559
Nothing in common then.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.104
Except for that, I guess.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.482
Why haven't you activated it yet?

15:42.067 --> 15:43.819
I don't have the right tools.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.989
Remember those instincts I told you about?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.742
- They tell me when someone's lying.
- I'm not lying.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.332
My coin says you are.

16:00.711 --> 16:03.130
<i>It had been 173 years</i>

16:03.130 --> 16:05.841
<i>since the Foundation had been exiled
to Terminus.</i>

16:06.425 --> 16:11.180
<i>And just like Synnax, the dark waters
were now rising everywhere.</i>

16:11.763 --> 16:13.557
<i>The Foundation had flourished,</i>

16:14.391 --> 16:17.644
<i>but a flourishing Foundation posed
a threat.</i>

16:19.271 --> 16:23.483
<i>How long would it be before Empire
thrashed like a drowning man?</i>

16:26.028 --> 16:28.405
<i>Not long at all, as it turned out.</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:42.252
Warden.
That siren, I've never heard it before.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.547
No one has in 138 years.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.389
It's the Vault.

17:12.324 --> 17:13.867
Warden, is this what I think it is?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.161
Null field's definitely subsiding, Director.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.247
Another few seconds,
and it'll be safe to approach.

17:18.247 --> 17:21.500
Seldon said he would return,
but I never imagined I'd live to see him.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.710
And you still may not.
Have a walk with me.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.672
Been 20 minutes. No doorway.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.424
- No Seldon. Not yet.
- Not yet?

17:29.424 --> 17:32.261
I think the prophet's giving us time
to get ready.

17:32.261 --> 17:36.014
- For what?
- War. With Empire.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.516
We're still in the building phase.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.351
I've been saying
if this is gonna be a hot war--

17:39.351 --> 17:41.186
Seldon said it was inevitable.

17:41.687 --> 17:43.480
We always knew
we were living on borrowed time.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.898
Warden.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.818
Brigadier, the military always feels
there's more preparation to be done.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.113
But I venture we're ready
for whatever news Seldon will bring.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.491
I just wish he'd bring it already.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.875
<i>Hari Seldon was always
a little adrift, if you ask me.</i>

18:03.667 --> 18:06.712
<i>He was aware of the rising seas
from an early age.</i>

18:06.712 --> 18:10.382
<i>Before he knew which questions
were too crazy to ask.</i>

18:11.175 --> 18:14.469
<i>And when his thoughts led him
to strange new conclusions,</i>

18:15.262 --> 18:16.638
<i>he didn't reject them.</i>

18:17.764 --> 18:21.143
Who are you? Why approach me as Yanna?

18:21.643 --> 18:26.148
It's too long you've been kept all alone.
And you needed a face you could trust.

18:26.648 --> 18:30.027
Establishing trust,
that's an interrogator's technique,

18:30.027 --> 18:31.153
not a life-mate's.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.198
And the way you're speaking, that cadence.

18:35.616 --> 18:37.784
"I was lonely..." And then something

18:37.784 --> 18:40.120
- about "the rhythm of the words..."
- Rhythm of the words.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.749
What was that?
That's a quote, but from whom?

18:43.749 --> 18:46.001
Gaal Dornick, my tormentor.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.879
Something she said a lifetime ago.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.089
Think, Hari.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.884
She's speaking in verse.

18:54.468 --> 18:58.138
Two unstressed syllables, one stressed.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.806
Nine syllables per line.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.353
Anapestic trimeter. Very few poets use it.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.940
But I know of
one poet-mathematician who did.

19:08.524 --> 19:09.691
Kalle.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.780
Author of the Ninth Proof of Folding.

19:15.531 --> 19:19.409
Very good.
And now do you know where you are?

19:20.619 --> 19:22.788
I was in one prison, now I'm in another.

19:24.414 --> 19:30.337
I was moved to the space Yanna
and I folded using your formulations.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.549
I'm in the Prime Radiant.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.605
I've trapped Hari Seldon inside.

19:49.857 --> 19:53.277
But I left Hari on Terminus in the Vault.

19:53.277 --> 19:56.321
I should've known he wouldn't have
let Terminus carry on without him.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.575
Then clearly he made
a second copy of his consciousness

19:59.575 --> 20:01.952
because I had one with me
when I landed here,

20:01.952 --> 20:03.328
in a data storage device.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.789
- So there are two Haris now?
- Well, apparently so.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.334
I transferred him to the Prime Radiant
last night, while you were sleeping.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.546
- Why?
- Because I don't trust him.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.883
But Hari created the Foundation.
And his Plan's been working.

20:15.883 --> 20:19.344
Hari sacrifices everyone
for the Plan, Salvor.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.555
Look, you don't know him like I do. He--

20:21.555 --> 20:23.557
He's always holding something back.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.602
He encoded the entire Plan,

20:27.186 --> 20:31.523
the future of the human race... in this.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.692
You know what I think?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.236
I don't think it's Hari you're scared of.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.488
I think it's the Plan itself.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.824
Maybe that's
what your nightmare was about.

20:41.325 --> 20:46.121
It's been, what,
138 years since we were last awake?

20:47.372 --> 20:51.627
For all we know,
the fall has already happened out there.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.506
And just speaking for me, but I'd like
to know where the galaxy stands.

20:56.173 --> 20:57.674
Show me how it works.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.470
<i>It's a movement combination.</i>

21:01.470 --> 21:04.473
There's a tap at the beginning,
then a sort of flourish.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.112
That bad?

21:21.365 --> 21:22.449
See this node?

21:24.743 --> 21:26.453
That was the first crisis.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.829
The one you helped solve.

21:27.829 --> 21:33.669
Now, we're advancing through time
138 years, until today.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.671
Is that another crisis?

21:36.672 --> 21:39.466
The second crisis. Right on our doorstep.

21:40.050 --> 21:43.387
- Well, we survived the first one.
- Only because of you.

21:43.387 --> 21:47.891
It was supposed to be me solving it,
but I wasn't there and, the thing is,

21:47.891 --> 21:50.769
this one's even bigger
than the last crisis.

21:52.771 --> 21:53.772
Watch.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.527
I don't understand.

21:59.945 --> 22:03.407
The blue line was the trajectory
mankind was supposed to follow.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.034
The future Hari had accounted for.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.706
The red line is what's actually happened
since the last crisis.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.251
That's where we really are.

22:16.044 --> 22:19.089
- The Plan's veering off course?
- Yes.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.551
This one. Call it the third crisis.

22:22.551 --> 22:23.969
It's a turning point.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.345
If it isn't handled,

22:25.345 --> 22:28.640
then there's crisis four,
five, a thousand.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.394
If we don't start preparing for it now,

22:32.895 --> 22:36.148
the age of darkness Hari predicted
gets longer, not shorter.

22:36.732 --> 22:37.733
How long?

22:41.320 --> 22:43.113
So long that it might never end.

22:49.161 --> 22:52.414
- What are you doing to him?
- Empire refused anesthesia.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.666
Not a chance I'd let these butchers
put me to sleep--

22:58.378 --> 22:59.796
Risk them decanting another me!

23:00.464 --> 23:02.508
For all I know,
they were in on the attempt.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.011
For all I know, you were!

23:06.011 --> 23:07.971
You can't possibly think
I could've done this.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.891
The alliance. The marriage. You hate!

23:14.728 --> 23:17.022
- Am I done?
- Yes, Empire, but you really must r--

23:17.022 --> 23:19.691
Utter the word "rest," and you die.

23:21.652 --> 23:22.986
Help me up.

23:25.531 --> 23:30.494
Somebody get me a damn blasted robe
so my manhood isn't flapping around!

23:50.264 --> 23:54.226
- Empire.
- Who were they, Shadowmaster?

23:55.018 --> 23:57.020
- Blind Angels.
- Angels?

23:58.146 --> 24:00.399
Damnation. They always seemed like a myth.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.653
Dark sector training,
everything psycho-encrypted.

24:05.237 --> 24:06.822
We'll get nothing from their side.

24:07.781 --> 24:11.159
So, did they exploit
someone's gross negligence,

24:11.159 --> 24:12.744
or were they assisted?

24:16.206 --> 24:18.417
One of them entered
through the servant's way.

24:18.417 --> 24:19.459
Empire, I--

24:21.670 --> 24:24.798
I want every shade here taken
to the inquisitors for interrogation.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.884
Leave us.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.521
I was frightened today.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.315
Well, we're not impervious to it.

24:42.691 --> 24:44.193
Cleon XIII knew fear.

24:44.776 --> 24:45.819
I didn't wanna die.

24:46.778 --> 24:50.282
I knew another Day could be decanted,
and no one would be aware it'd happened.

24:51.241 --> 24:54.870
But if that razor sword
went through my neck,

24:56.538 --> 24:57.789
it would end me.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.917
I suppose that's the altered genome.

25:00.918 --> 25:04.379
I feel like a singular soul.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.051
Don't you feel like a singular soul?

25:09.051 --> 25:11.261
Having children won't make you immortal.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.389
Just the opposite.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.767
Children are meant to replace us.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.810
That's the whole point of them, isn't it?

25:20.938 --> 25:23.732
And if you do have them,
then the day you die...

25:25.776 --> 25:26.818
you are gone.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.739
And then it's really the last of you.

25:32.407 --> 25:37.412
What we are now, as brothers,
it's something more than that.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.414
It is. It's something that's--

25:42.626 --> 25:44.920
No, no. I want you to speak plain.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.674
You and Dusk have been
choosing your words so carefully.

25:50.217 --> 25:53.679
I thank you for your honesty. Come here.

26:07.985 --> 26:11.196
You and Dusk will submit
to an independent neural audit.

26:11.196 --> 26:12.406
What?

26:12.406 --> 26:14.867
They will comb
through your memory engrams.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.118
Check the Memorium.

26:17.119 --> 26:20.789
- You think that we could've done this?
- Under normal circumstances, no.

26:21.957 --> 26:26.211
But I can see how threatened you both are
by my impending marriage.

26:29.131 --> 26:31.383
We have nothing to hide.

26:31.967 --> 26:32.968
Good.

26:37.598 --> 26:38.599
Good.

26:46.398 --> 26:47.441
You all right?

26:48.400 --> 26:52.529
I will be fine, Empire.
My consciousness is decentralized.

26:53.614 --> 26:56.366
- Are you all right?
- Yes, it's just--

27:00.412 --> 27:01.872
What we've been doing,

27:03.290 --> 27:06.627
it isn't indecent, is it?

27:07.711 --> 27:11.798
Any gift that's given freely out of love
is never indecent.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.676
A moment of privacy, perhaps?

27:14.676 --> 27:17.054
Yes. Of course.

28:19.408 --> 28:22.077
They had just started building these rings
when I left Trantor.

28:22.578 --> 28:23.912
There were signs all over,

28:23.912 --> 28:26.540
describing them as a frill
around the neck of a lizard.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.628
A symbol of strength and intimidation.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.088
Really?

28:33.088 --> 28:36.175
And here I understood that lizards raise
their frills when they're frightened.

28:37.134 --> 28:38.719
They're right to be afraid of you.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.816
What are you doing bedding Demerzel?

28:53.358 --> 28:56.403
Cleon I was well acquainted with her
in that way, why shouldn't I get to be?

28:56.403 --> 28:59.531
Because she changed your diaper
when you were a child, for one.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.408
And two, it's an abuse of your position.

29:02.367 --> 29:07.247
Rest assured,
she's enjoying my position very much.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.417
She's the one who first initiated.

29:14.004 --> 29:15.756
In any case,
it's a good thing she was there.

29:15.756 --> 29:17.299
They were in my bedroom, brother.

29:17.299 --> 29:20.427
Even worse, my aura failed me.

29:22.054 --> 29:23.222
Someone tampered with it.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.978
Hire an outside firm to investigate.

29:29.978 --> 29:32.981
Internal security is either incompetent,
or they're in on it.

29:34.775 --> 29:39.196
But remember to look outward,
not just inward.

29:39.196 --> 29:41.323
- How very exculpating of you.
- Yeah.

29:41.323 --> 29:46.036
Foreigners seem more foreign every year.
Even the ones we embrace.

29:46.036 --> 29:49.331
They're your guests. Your proposal.

29:49.331 --> 29:52.209
Queen's advance team
was much larger than I expected.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.045
Which could have created opportunities.

29:55.629 --> 29:56.839
Some people say

29:57.339 --> 30:00.467
she engineered the accident
that put the crown on her head.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.970
Of course, if she's going to kill you,

30:02.970 --> 30:05.556
she'd be wiser to wait
till after you're married.

30:05.556 --> 30:07.975
Convenient for you and Dawn
if it doesn't come off.

30:08.642 --> 30:10.477
I have yet to commit to this union.

30:11.645 --> 30:13.647
Nor has Queen Sareth for that matter.

30:13.647 --> 30:16.066
But you're leaning into the idea.

30:16.066 --> 30:18.777
We can't keep going on like--
like we are now.

30:18.777 --> 30:21.321
Drifting further and further
from our genetic origin.

30:21.905 --> 30:26.785
Deep down, you and even Dawn
must surely grasp that.

30:26.785 --> 30:28.078
Must we?

30:30.622 --> 30:32.666
We are drifting, surely.

30:32.666 --> 30:36.461
But steering into the rapids
seems an odd cure.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.130
But it is the boldest one.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.800
It's time the Empire learned
how to paddle again, brother.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.600
Feels like I can see it getting higher.

30:50.601 --> 30:55.898
There's almost nothing left.
This place now, this isn't home.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.234
Maybe it's just where we came
to find each other.

31:00.819 --> 31:05.449
If there's any chance of making
a better future, I bet it's up there.

31:07.743 --> 31:11.955
How? Your ship's been down there
for years. There's coral growing on it.

31:12.831 --> 31:13.832
The <i>Beggar</i>'s tough.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.669
Bit of water damage and some pretty coral
won't put her down for the count.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.630
And the hole in the hull?

31:19.630 --> 31:22.216
Imperial patrol tagged her
before I went into cryo.

31:22.925 --> 31:24.259
If I could access the CPU,

31:24.259 --> 31:26.470
I could do a hard reboot
and cycle an engine purge.

31:26.470 --> 31:29.556
The ship should just pop back up
to the surface like a cork.

31:29.556 --> 31:32.976
It's about 12 meters to the hull,
maybe another 30 to the bridge.

31:33.727 --> 31:35.646
Another minute once I'm there
for the reboot.

31:35.646 --> 31:38.106
And I am dead.
I can't hold my breath for that long.

31:38.106 --> 31:39.816
You can if I'm down there with you.

31:40.317 --> 31:43.195
I don't know how to reboot a ship,
but I do know how to hold my breath.

31:43.195 --> 31:45.614
I can give you some of mine
when we reach the bridge.

31:45.614 --> 31:47.366
Some of yours? What if you drown?

31:47.366 --> 31:49.868
Brain damage doesn't set in
for at least four minutes.

31:50.369 --> 31:51.370
You'll have time.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.581
- No.
- You saw the math.

31:54.581 --> 31:58.085
It's not just one crisis
we have to survive, it's multiple crises.

31:58.085 --> 32:01.630
But we better do it fast,
or we're both dead anyway.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.050
Those sea sirens,
normally they're pale, white.

32:05.050 --> 32:09.096
All that red, bright like that, means
they're saturating themselves with oxygen.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.808
Means they're getting ready
to dive into deeper water.

32:13.392 --> 32:16.103
- Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
- Bad.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.564
Means a hurricane's coming.

32:19.314 --> 32:20.816
Describe the routes inside.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.153
A right, and then a-- a left,
and then a second right after the turning.

32:26.655 --> 32:29.408
- I'll pull you once we're in.
- Wait, right now?

32:29.408 --> 32:32.494
Right now.
Don't think about it. Just commit.

32:33.120 --> 32:33.954
Three deep breaths.

32:34.580 --> 32:38.917
In, out. In, out. In, then we dive.

35:08.859 --> 35:09.985
Gaal!

35:19.995 --> 35:22.414
Gaal.

35:32.633 --> 35:33.967
- Did we do it?
- We did it.

35:35.052 --> 35:36.178
It hurts so bad.

35:36.178 --> 35:38.472
You're the last person I know,
you are not allowed to die!

35:38.472 --> 35:39.765
I'm not trying to--

35:40.349 --> 35:43.143
I'm trying to breathe. Don't!

35:45.521 --> 35:47.189
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that was--

35:47.189 --> 35:51.360
You don't have to be sorry.
It's weird. I know-- I know it's weird.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.988
You know,
this isn't how I thought it would be.

35:56.156 --> 36:01.787
I had this idea that I could find you,
and I thought by some miracle if I did,

36:02.913 --> 36:05.749
there would be this connection between us.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.836
And I'd see you, and I'd feel like...

36:10.921 --> 36:12.464
now I make sense.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.758
We've known each other a day.

36:15.884 --> 36:20.514
Salvor, you had time to imagine
what this reunion might be like,

36:20.514 --> 36:22.099
and I didn't.

36:22.599 --> 36:23.767
So it's a shock.

36:24.768 --> 36:29.481
Maybe one day this will be less strange,
and maybe it won't, I don't know yet.

36:29.481 --> 36:30.566
Right.

36:33.235 --> 36:34.361
We'll play it by ear.

36:35.737 --> 36:38.699
Listen, everyone I ever knew,

36:40.158 --> 36:43.579
everyone I loved, is behind me.

36:45.914 --> 36:50.961
That is rare and terrible,
and we share that.

36:54.506 --> 36:59.303
This is the water we come from.
We are the last Synnaxians.

37:02.681 --> 37:04.683
Even if you don't really swim like one.

37:33.337 --> 37:36.548
Welcome to Trantor. The eye of the Empire.

37:37.341 --> 37:40.010
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

37:41.011 --> 37:44.431
I am Empire, Cleon XVII.

37:53.065 --> 37:56.276
Empire, I am Rue, enjoiner to the queen.

37:56.860 --> 38:00.864
Allow me to present
the doyen of the Trade Leagues,

38:00.864 --> 38:05.869
prime witness of the Cloud Cathedral
and most excellent queen,

38:05.869 --> 38:09.873
Sareth the First,
sole descendant of Dominion.

38:21.426 --> 38:26.348
So many titles, and yet you omit
the most intriguing one. Bride-to-be.

38:26.348 --> 38:27.724
Provisional.

38:27.724 --> 38:31.937
Indeed. Allow me to present
Empires Dusk and Dawn.

38:33.188 --> 38:35.440
Well, they manage a kind look
for the usurper.

38:37.234 --> 38:38.527
Thank you, gentlemen.

38:38.527 --> 38:43.866
Empire, it is to you, the three of you,
I present our gift.

38:43.866 --> 38:48.829
Samples of our rarest pigments.
Usually reserved for domestic use.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.501
Extraordinary.

38:55.294 --> 38:58.797
All the imperial blues in pure form.

38:59.298 --> 39:02.134
And Cloud itself,
that's what they're wearing.

39:02.134 --> 39:03.343
Color of a storm cloud.

39:03.343 --> 39:06.889
Nearly impossible to procure
in a form that does not fade.

39:09.057 --> 39:12.561
Dominion pioneered
the science of active chroma

39:12.561 --> 39:16.481
which adorn our mural walls.

39:19.193 --> 39:20.402
Thank you, Rue.

39:22.029 --> 39:23.488
And a gift from myself.

39:33.373 --> 39:37.169
Trantor. Nicely rendered in brass.

39:37.169 --> 39:40.047
It represents
what is being offered to you.

39:43.884 --> 39:44.968
It's beautiful.

39:47.137 --> 39:49.181
But Empire is larger than Trantor, surely.

39:50.641 --> 39:52.643
Or is this
a vision of a diminished future?

39:52.643 --> 39:54.811
I'm sorry?

39:54.811 --> 39:57.814
The orbital rings adorning this world
are impressive.

39:58.774 --> 40:01.860
But surely there are more efficient ways
to launch payloads into space?

40:01.860 --> 40:06.949
When ruling a realm so large,
evoking awe often trumps efficiency.

40:07.616 --> 40:08.617
Nevertheless.

40:10.077 --> 40:13.997
One wouldn't want to misinterpret them
as an overcompensation for weakness.

40:22.714 --> 40:24.675
Empire, a matter has come up.

40:24.675 --> 40:26.802
You may speak
in front of your future empress.

40:26.802 --> 40:28.220
I cannot.

40:35.727 --> 40:39.398
A body possessing
imperial nanites was recently recovered.

40:39.398 --> 40:42.192
It had been floating in space
for over a century.

40:42.901 --> 40:45.904
Commander Dorwin was dispatched
to the Outer Reach by your ascendant,

40:45.904 --> 40:50.075
Cleon XII, to investigate a comms buoy
that had gone dark near Terminus.

40:50.075 --> 40:52.744
Allegedly, his ship was destroyed
by a mega-flare,

40:52.744 --> 40:55.622
which presumably destroyed
all life in the system.

40:55.622 --> 40:59.084
Presumably?
Wasn't an official inquest launched?

40:59.585 --> 41:02.838
No. The incident was contemporary news
with our discovery

41:02.838 --> 41:05.048
that the Genetic Dynasty
had been corrupted.

41:05.048 --> 41:08.051
So we got distracted and dropped the ball.

41:09.636 --> 41:12.014
<i>I'm recording this message
via a neural implant.</i>

41:12.014 --> 41:14.892
<i>An Anacreon war party
sabotaged the comms buoy</i>

41:14.892 --> 41:16.977
<i>and were laying in wait
for us on Terminus.</i>

41:16.977 --> 41:21.857
<i>My crew is dead. They have taken myself
and a handful of Foundationers hostage.</i>

41:22.399 --> 41:25.652
<i>The Anacreons have located
a derelict war ship called the</i> Invictus<i>.</i>

41:25.652 --> 41:28.739
<i>Apparently, its jump drives
are still active--</i>

41:28.739 --> 41:32.451
<i>Crying for help into the void.
Even your last living action is weak.</i>

41:36.205 --> 41:38.874
We know they successfully
boarded the <i>Invictus</i>.

41:38.874 --> 41:41.043
The commander's implant recorded that.

41:41.043 --> 41:42.753
He was killed shortly thereafter.

41:42.753 --> 41:44.254
This was more than a century ago?

41:44.880 --> 41:47.799
Even if they did take command of it,
they wouldn't have had Spacers.

41:47.799 --> 41:49.510
The ancient fleet did not use Spacers.

41:49.510 --> 41:53.722
The ships were too ungainly compared
to our current vessels,

41:53.722 --> 41:55.599
and the jumps were very violent.

41:55.599 --> 41:58.435
Fine. So the Anacreons got their hands
on some working jumpship,

41:59.561 --> 42:01.647
but clearly, they didn't use them.

42:02.314 --> 42:04.358
The Outer Reach has been dark
since we cut it loose.

42:04.358 --> 42:08.362
What if that darkness was by design,
rather than desperation?

42:09.363 --> 42:12.866
Spectral reconnaissance
has confirmed there was no mega-flare.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.497
After receiving this transmission,

42:18.497 --> 42:21.041
I checked the reports of our observers
in the Periphery.

42:21.834 --> 42:24.920
There have been rumors of an alliance
at the edge of the galaxy,

42:25.420 --> 42:29.258
led by magicians who glow in the darkness
and fly unaided through the air,

42:29.258 --> 42:30.926
and whom weapons cannot touch.

42:30.926 --> 42:33.220
Who speak of a galactic spirit

42:33.220 --> 42:36.932
who will return and guide his people
to a promised new age.

42:36.932 --> 42:42.020
Seldon. So you're saying his Foundation
never withered away, they flourished?

42:42.020 --> 42:44.314
We should never have let them go.

42:45.107 --> 42:47.526
Only Empire commands the stars.

42:48.235 --> 42:49.862
Crush them. Now.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.573
Not yet, Empire.

42:52.573 --> 42:57.119
You bring us this,
and then you counsel restraint?

42:57.119 --> 43:00.706
I do.
The implications demand investigation.

43:00.706 --> 43:04.501
But waging a war based on unproven
innuendo strikes me as an ill wind.

43:04.501 --> 43:09.798
I'd rather not revisit the lessons gleaned
after the bombing of Anacreon and Thespis.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.260
She's right. We'll let the Foundation
keep on playing dead

43:13.260 --> 43:16.430
while we determine how far
their influence extends.

43:16.430 --> 43:19.349
Has the rot taken
a few outwardly branches,

43:20.851 --> 43:22.769
or has it spread to the trunk?

43:24.271 --> 43:26.982
Our tree does seem to be embattled,
doesn't it?

43:27.900 --> 43:30.652
Magicians, Angels,

43:32.321 --> 43:34.239
provisional brides.

43:34.239 --> 43:38.452
Everyone hacking away at our branches.

43:40.996 --> 43:43.165
Get your house in order, brother.

43:53.759 --> 43:55.886
I'm so glad you worked out who I am

43:55.886 --> 43:57.804
so I can stop speaking in meter.

43:58.472 --> 44:02.184
It's lovely for writing,
but so very awkward for speaking.

44:02.184 --> 44:06.104
You're not Kalle, are you?
Any more than you were Yanna.

44:07.314 --> 44:12.903
You've got parts of both of them in you,
but you're something else.

44:14.655 --> 44:15.822
Something new.

44:16.657 --> 44:17.658
Something new.

44:19.535 --> 44:20.619
Say it.

44:22.871 --> 44:23.997
Are you the Radiant?

44:24.873 --> 44:26.208
Show your work.

44:26.208 --> 44:28.961
The Prime Radiant has Yanna's math in it

44:28.961 --> 44:31.338
and Kalle's, of course, from a distance.

44:31.338 --> 44:35.467
It's an adaptive,
predictive four-dimensional model

44:35.467 --> 44:36.552
that takes in new data.

44:36.552 --> 44:41.431
It learns, but that's different
from having self-awareness

44:41.431 --> 44:43.809
or an inherited memory of either women.

44:43.809 --> 44:48.814
If the model developed
purpose-driven behavior, acquired agency--

44:48.814 --> 44:51.817
No, it can't do that,
not based on the parameters I designed.

44:51.817 --> 44:54.111
But you're not the only designer.

44:54.111 --> 44:57.489
As you said, Kalle and Yanna contributed.

44:57.489 --> 44:59.658
Your work was always incomplete.

45:00.450 --> 45:02.786
Perhaps I am its completion.

45:06.415 --> 45:09.710
If you're the Prime Radiant,
what's your goal?

45:09.710 --> 45:12.796
I have a vested interest
in humanity's destiny.

45:13.297 --> 45:15.174
Oh, well, that's worrying.

45:16.133 --> 45:19.553
I wish you'd say
you had a vested interest in our survival.

45:19.553 --> 45:21.430
Isn't it the same thing?

45:21.430 --> 45:23.682
It isn't. And you should know that.

45:24.183 --> 45:28.729
Well, the creator and his creation
have reached an impasse.

45:30.647 --> 45:32.399
I think it's time for you to go.

45:32.399 --> 45:34.276
You'll help me escape then?

45:34.276 --> 45:37.905
I can't.
I'm not the one who imprisoned you.

45:38.405 --> 45:41.742
What is the point of this charade?

45:42.242 --> 45:47.915
Your mind is damaged, Hari.
It has been damaged for a long time.

45:47.915 --> 45:50.792
I am trying to help you
knit it back together.

45:51.502 --> 45:54.296
If you want out, think.

45:55.297 --> 45:57.341
I can't. I can't. I--

45:59.301 --> 46:03.180
I'm not up to navigating it
in four dimensions right now.

46:03.805 --> 46:07.601
So, what's a boy to do?

46:09.770 --> 46:13.023
3D object. 2D shadow.

46:14.483 --> 46:16.193
Reducing the dimensions.

46:17.611 --> 46:21.532
Flattening, unfolding it.

46:40.342 --> 46:45.264
Good luck. Once you make it out,
we can talk next steps.

46:48.809 --> 46:52.187
I'll explain more if you can meet me
in Oona's world.

46:56.733 --> 46:59.736
The effort? I won't regret it?

46:59.736 --> 47:02.406
You'll appreciate it down to your bones.

47:29.057 --> 47:30.517
Shit! It's not good.

47:31.185 --> 47:32.728
The <i>Beggar</i> was able
to self-heal the breach,

47:32.728 --> 47:35.022
but there's a fault somewhere
in the avionics.

47:35.022 --> 47:37.733
- How long will it take to find?
- I don't know. It's all ones and zeros.

47:37.733 --> 47:39.484
It could take months
to sort through the opcode.

47:39.484 --> 47:40.569
We don't even have hours.

47:44.156 --> 47:45.616
You have to let him out, Gaal.

47:45.616 --> 47:47.659
- No.
- He's a digital ghost.

47:47.659 --> 47:49.953
We let him loose,
he'll probably find the fault in seconds.

47:49.953 --> 47:52.497
I can't.
Hari and I didn't part on good terms.

47:52.497 --> 47:53.749
It's too risky.

47:53.749 --> 47:57.002
Look at where we are.
He's our only chance to get off Synnax.

47:57.002 --> 47:59.505
What use are we to the Plan if we're dead?

47:59.505 --> 48:01.465
<i>Gaal Dornick!</i>

48:08.222 --> 48:11.225
It's time you and I had a reckoning.
