WEBVTT

00:06.852 --> 00:08.328
Previously on E.R.

00:08.329 --> 00:10.802
- Is that alcohol on your breath?
- Champagne.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.540
It's grounds for expulsion.

00:13.154 --> 00:16.088
It's none of your business.
We made a decision. That's final.

00:16.088 --> 00:17.965
No way. No way!

00:17.966 --> 00:19.252
No! No!

00:19.768 --> 00:23.432
She's my baby, Susan,
and I want her back.

00:23.433 --> 00:24.799
I'm adopting her.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.093
- The family had a right to know.
- You're right.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.153
- You made a mistake.
- Why don't you just get out?

00:30.882 --> 00:33.099
Peter, Doug can handle this. Go on.

00:34.041 --> 00:35.679
Go on.

00:38.020 --> 00:40.703
"A Shift In the Night"

00:42.578 --> 00:44.783
...bringing you traffic
and weather on the 1.

00:44.954 --> 00:48.618
Rain all over Chicagoland today.
The rain continues to come down...

00:48.790 --> 00:51.790
...causing flooding on I-94
and other expressways.

00:51.959 --> 00:55.540
The WMAQ weather calls for
the rain to continue into tonight...

00:55.711 --> 00:58.248
...and it stays in our forecast
through tomorrow.

00:58.421 --> 01:00.626
Bring an umbrella, raincoat
and life preserver-

01:00.797 --> 01:02.456
Son of a bitch.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:12.220 --> 01:14.212
Son of a bitch!

02:10.463 --> 02:12.621
Please leave a message at the tone.

02:12.799 --> 02:17.008
Mark? Mark, if you 're there,
it's Kerry Weaver. Could you pick up?

02:17.176 --> 02:19.582
We got a little problem.
Neal Hansen's on tonight...

02:19.761 --> 02:22.630
...but his mother-in-law died, so...

02:22.804 --> 02:26.254
The answer is no, Kerry.
I am not coming in.

02:27.556 --> 02:29.881
I don't care if his
mother-in-law died, okay?

02:30.059 --> 02:32.513
I've been on three nights in a row.

02:34.270 --> 02:39.510
Tell Morgenstern that I can't
and give the shift to Doug Ross.

02:39.688 --> 02:42.225
He could use the money.

02:42.398 --> 02:44.722
What do you mean, whiplash?

02:44.900 --> 02:48.517
No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
Vertebral bodies are in good alignment.

02:48.694 --> 02:51.398
There is, however,
reversal of cervical lordosis...

02:51.571 --> 02:56.528
...suggesting the possibility of
acute cervical ligamentous injury.

02:57.616 --> 02:59.692
My headache tripled
during that dissertation.

02:59.868 --> 03:02.109
Does the name Evelyn Wood
mean anything to you?

03:02.328 --> 03:06.323
You know, Doug, I like you in that collar.
It's a good look.

03:06.496 --> 03:09.247
Bold, yet spiritual.

03:09.581 --> 03:11.454
No, I'm stopped dead
at the stoplight...

03:11.624 --> 03:14.197
...and this Pakistani cabdriver
plows into me.

03:14.376 --> 03:16.451
I get out. He doesn't speak
a word of English.

03:16.627 --> 03:19.792
I look at his photo ID and it's some
sandy-haired guy named Kroopf.

03:19.963 --> 03:22.713
Kroopf?
Isn't that kind of a German name?

03:22.881 --> 03:25.039
- Can I have your shoes?
- What?

03:25.216 --> 03:27.374
Can I have your shoes?
Mine are sopping wet.

03:27.551 --> 03:32.294
Sure, Mark, absolutely. You know,
I'll just walk home barefoot in the rain.

03:33.304 --> 03:36.636
- Sorry. I would've taken that shift-
- No problem at all, Doug.

03:36.806 --> 03:39.556
I've only worked graveyard
the last three nights.

03:39.724 --> 03:41.217
Got off at 8:00 this morning...

03:41.392 --> 03:43.882
...drove to Milwaukee
to spend the day with Rachel...

03:44.060 --> 03:47.179
...only to have Jennifer tell me
that she got the dates mixed up.

03:47.354 --> 03:51.931
See, Rachel, it turns out, is on some
Brownie troop camping trip.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.811
So I drove back,
three and a half hours this time...

03:54.984 --> 03:58.397
...because of the heavy rain
and flooding on I-94.

03:58.568 --> 04:04.190
And here I am, refreshed
and full of enthusiasm for my work.

04:06.782 --> 04:08.988
Are you on tonight?

04:09.159 --> 04:11.151
Go with God.

05:04.275 --> 05:07.358
- Why are these patients in the hallway?
- No beds.

05:07.527 --> 05:10.811
- You're on tonight, right?
- No, dinner with my lawyer at 7:00.

05:10.987 --> 05:14.106
Dr. Lewis, a Peter Kreidman called.
Can't make dinner till 7:30.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.279
- Oh, 7:30.
- Can you change that to tomorrow night?

05:17.448 --> 05:20.567
Hansen's out,
Doug has got whiplash...

05:20.742 --> 05:24.442
...Benton's in some marathon surgery
and Kerry and I will be short-handed.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.113
Mark, I'm sorry, I can't.

05:26.288 --> 05:30.200
Chloe's gonna try and fight
this adoption. I can't miss this.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.327
- Mark, I was afraid I'd miss you.
- You're leaving too?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.286
- I've been on 14 hours.
- I've been on the last three nights.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.081
I'd stay, but Morgenstern wants me
to present our QA...

05:39.254 --> 05:40.831
...at the JCAH in the morning.

05:41.005 --> 05:45.000
Whoever handled it dropped the ball.
I'll be up all night pulling it together.

05:45.174 --> 05:48.292
- It's a real mess.
- Yeah, I was handling it.

05:48.467 --> 05:51.466
I'll walk you through it
once I get it straightened out.

05:51.636 --> 05:54.208
Shall we make rounds?

05:54.387 --> 05:58.300
Mr. PCP is sleeping it off.
Probably needs another six hours.

05:58.473 --> 06:02.683
Second-degree burns, both hands.
Checking pot roast, forgot hotpads.

06:02.851 --> 06:05.009
Gangbanger in a fistfight.

06:05.186 --> 06:08.185
- Fistfight? That's quaint.
- Waiting on x-rays.

06:08.354 --> 06:10.641
38 years old, AIDS,
hand and foot spasms.

06:10.814 --> 06:14.513
CMV retinitis, PCP pneumonia,
Gl lymphoma, waiting on ICU.

06:14.691 --> 06:16.813
Rule-out Ml.
Waiting on Cardiology consult.

06:16.984 --> 06:19.557
Calls himself Bobby Darin,
claims he got a shark bite...

06:19.735 --> 06:22.855
...while in the pool at the Four
Seasons Hotel. Waiting on Psych.

06:23.321 --> 06:27.816
Ten-centimeter laceration sustained while
sliding into second. Needs sutures.

06:27.991 --> 06:32.237
Abdominal pain, probably food poisoning,
but Surgery's ruling out an appy.

06:32.411 --> 06:34.318
Severe shoulder pain and nosebleed.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.028
Platelet count, 15,000.
Waiting on Hematology.

06:38.205 --> 06:40.777
TPA patient on dopamine.
Pulmonary edema.

06:40.957 --> 06:44.289
Intubated on a nitro drip.
Waiting on ICU.

06:44.459 --> 06:47.494
Bicycle versus postal truck.
Multiple rib fractures...

06:47.669 --> 06:51.748
...bilateral hemopneumothoraces.
Critical but stable.

06:51.922 --> 06:54.163
Let me guess. ICU?

06:54.340 --> 06:56.581
Anaphylactic shock...

06:56.758 --> 06:59.628
...and septic shock.

06:59.802 --> 07:02.504
I think that's about it.

07:02.677 --> 07:05.346
How are things in Glocca Morra?

07:12.183 --> 07:15.765
Unbelievable. It's been
like this since the rain started.

07:15.936 --> 07:20.014
- Who else is on besides me?
- A few Residents, a Psych intern...

07:20.189 --> 07:22.809
...and maybe Carter. Good night.

07:26.025 --> 07:28.562
LOL with burned hands
admitted to burn service...

07:28.735 --> 07:31.141
...films on that gang kid were negative,
sent him home...

07:31.320 --> 07:33.810
...and the rule-out appy
was ruled out and discharged.

07:33.988 --> 07:36.359
Excellent, Haleh,
you get three gold stars. Carter?

07:36.531 --> 07:41.238
I have sutured the leg lac in 4, knee lac
in 3, arm lac in 2 and head lac in 1.

07:41.409 --> 07:45.357
That's it? All right.
We have seven waiting for ICU.

07:45.537 --> 07:49.236
Make it eight. Bounce-back hip
replacement with DVT and PE.

07:49.415 --> 07:52.118
We have 33 in the ER
and 41 in the waiting room.

07:52.290 --> 07:56.535
Make that 42. Paramedics
pulling in with an altered LOC.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.867
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it...

07:59.044 --> 08:01.167
...which you will,
because you have no choice...

08:01.338 --> 08:05.036
...is to move these folks out
so we can move these folks in.

08:05.215 --> 08:08.049
I want quick turnover.
No big workups.

08:08.217 --> 08:12.960
No unnecessary labs, x-rays
or consults. And no comments.

08:13.137 --> 08:15.212
Carol, Carter,
let's go meet the incoming.

08:15.388 --> 08:18.221
Randi, I want a turkey sandwich
from the cafeteria...

08:18.389 --> 08:20.215
...because Jerry isn't here yet.

08:20.391 --> 08:24.552
Sorry, I'm late. And I can't be
responsible for him, Dr. Greene.

08:26.811 --> 08:29.051
Let me out of here!

08:29.896 --> 08:32.054
- Hi, Chuny. You're late.
- I'm on at 8:00.

08:32.231 --> 08:33.890
It's 8:04.
What have we got?

08:34.066 --> 08:37.315
Omar Gandera, 15. Strolling down
by The Loop, drunk out of his mind.

08:37.485 --> 08:39.690
Vitals are stable. BP, 120/80.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.818
Fell on his knees.
He needs stitches.

08:41.986 --> 08:44.558
- Are you guys having a party?
- Don't start, Doris.

08:44.738 --> 08:47.655
- How much did you drink, Omar?
- Don't touch me! Get out of here!

08:47.824 --> 08:50.692
- Can I give Mrs. Layton more Demerol?
- How long has it been?

08:50.867 --> 08:54.779
- Three hours.
- All right, if you help with this kid.

08:56.287 --> 09:00.615
All right. On my count.
One, two, three.

09:01.081 --> 09:05.160
- Put me down!
- Buckle him up tight. Party on.

09:05.334 --> 09:08.666
- Let me out of here!
- Sinus tach at 110.

09:08.836 --> 09:11.954
- Carter, what do you want to do?
- BP's still 120/80.

09:12.129 --> 09:14.287
CBC, Chem-7,
blood alcohol, tox screen...

09:14.463 --> 09:17.464
...ABG and saline. Wide open.

09:20.176 --> 09:22.085
- Carter, she said tie him tight.
- I did!

09:22.260 --> 09:24.668
- Labs are back on the kid with the fever.
- Any films?

09:24.845 --> 09:27.253
- Not yet.
- Go sit on Radiology...

09:27.430 --> 09:29.636
...and don't bug me
until you've got everything.

09:29.807 --> 09:35.095
- Carter, get the labs going. I'll be back.
- Oh, yeah. We're having some fun now.

09:35.269 --> 09:37.343
There are non-displaced
oblique fractures...

09:37.520 --> 09:39.807
...of the third and fourth
metatarsal shafts...

09:39.979 --> 09:42.434
...with no significant
angulation or comminution.

09:42.606 --> 09:46.602
The foot's busted, okay?
Splint him and ship him out.

09:47.651 --> 09:49.606
- What are you doing?
- Gonna fix his feet.

09:49.777 --> 09:53.774
What did he do, stick them in a blender?
No more mixed drinks.

09:53.946 --> 09:57.943
Put him on the back burner.
We've got people who are a lot worse.

09:58.115 --> 10:01.613
- Could you take a look at my mother?
- In a minute.

10:01.784 --> 10:02.862
What a mess, huh?

10:03.034 --> 10:04.943
It's not helped by the fact
you were late.

10:05.118 --> 10:07.325
- Are you the doctor in charge?
- The one and only.

10:07.496 --> 10:09.617
My son has a horrible cut on his hand.

10:09.789 --> 10:12.361
- We'll get to him as soon as we can.
- I'll bring him in.

10:12.665 --> 10:14.906
Jerry, can you take her
to the waiting room?

10:15.084 --> 10:17.122
It's bleeding.
We've been waiting out there.

10:17.293 --> 10:18.574
- Come on, ma'am.
- Jerry?

10:18.752 --> 10:21.669
Don't let people sneak in.
Whoever's out there has been triaged.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.292
We'll see them as soon as we can.
No one gets in...

10:24.465 --> 10:26.622
- ... unless they're dying.
- Right.

10:29.258 --> 10:31.215
Malik?

10:31.385 --> 10:34.468
Mrs. Votey, you're having
weakness in your right arm?

10:34.637 --> 10:37.471
Yesterday and again today.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.796
Everything's sort of out of focus.

10:39.973 --> 10:44.680
- At one point she couldn't even speak.
- Scared my students half to death.

10:44.851 --> 10:47.851
- My mother teaches self-defense.
- To seniors.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.178
Squeeze.

10:50.355 --> 10:53.141
Maybe I could just wait here
for my regular doctor.

10:53.315 --> 10:55.804
- Dr. Randall. Jack Randall.
- I know him.

10:56.024 --> 10:59.889
Mrs. Votey, you might be experiencing
what we call TIAs...

11:00.068 --> 11:02.274
...transient ischemic attacks.

11:02.444 --> 11:05.113
They can be a warning sign
of impending stroke.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.478
I'll call Dr. Randall...

11:06.655 --> 11:11.232
...but in the meantime I'll admit you
upstairs where they can work you up.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.649
Start her on heparin, 800 an hour...

11:13.827 --> 11:15.902
...call Randall and get her admitted
to Medicine.

11:16.078 --> 11:19.327
- You want a CT first?
- Let them do it. We need the room.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.405
I don't get it. He's still altered...

11:21.581 --> 11:23.739
- ... but his tox screen's negative.
- I have to pee.

11:23.915 --> 11:25.326
- Ethanol?
- None detected.

11:25.499 --> 11:27.456
- PH?
-7.30.

11:27.626 --> 11:30.116
- Omar, what did you drink?
- I've got to pee.

11:30.295 --> 11:31.918
Omar?

11:32.921 --> 11:34.415
- I gotta pee.
- Go ahead and pee.

11:34.589 --> 11:36.082
There's a tube in your bladder.

11:36.257 --> 11:38.378
Paramedics five minutes out.
Drive-by shooting.

11:38.549 --> 11:40.708
- Who's on call for Trauma?
- Shall I call Benton?

11:40.885 --> 11:43.007
- No. Call Thoracic.
- Thoracic?

11:43.178 --> 11:47.836
You heard me. Call Morgenstern,
tell him we are closing the Trauma now.

11:48.013 --> 11:49.554
- Lytes?
- Not back yet.

11:49.722 --> 11:52.177
- What's wrong with the lab tonight?
- Same thing as us.

11:52.349 --> 11:53.926
There's just too many patients.

11:55.517 --> 11:59.015
Okay. Say he has a gap.

11:59.895 --> 12:05.315
Methanol, uremia, DKA.
Ethylene glycol?

12:06.691 --> 12:11.352
- You think he drank antifreeze?
- Well, gotta rule it out.

12:11.528 --> 12:13.518
Get a Wood's lamp.

12:15.195 --> 12:16.938
- It's really jammed in there.
- What?

12:17.113 --> 12:18.773
I said, it's really jammed in there!

12:18.948 --> 12:21.521
- Carter, what are you doing?
- Foreign body in the canal.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.822
Have him lie down.

12:26.369 --> 12:27.994
- Do you know what it is, sir?
- What?

12:28.162 --> 12:29.573
A bead.

12:30.705 --> 12:34.453
Carter, you having fun paying
your penance in the ER?

12:35.292 --> 12:37.165
I'm off Surgical Service...

12:37.335 --> 12:41.164
...I'm working nights in the ER.
What's not to be happy about?

12:41.336 --> 12:44.538
It's better than not graduating.
I thought Dr. Hicks might suspend me.

12:44.713 --> 12:46.290
She would if she could have.

12:46.465 --> 12:49.299
I can't believe I was that stupid,
drinking on call.

12:49.466 --> 12:51.008
I can. You're a medical student.

12:52.885 --> 12:54.960
Superglue?

12:55.137 --> 12:59.713
Yes. Just touch the bead.
Hit the skin, you're in trouble.

13:01.057 --> 13:03.428
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

13:03.600 --> 13:06.220
Dr. Greene, the paramedics are here.

13:08.061 --> 13:09.388
Got it!

13:11.854 --> 13:13.397
- How old is she?
-18 months.

13:13.564 --> 13:17.347
Two gunshots to the right upper leg.
Hypotensive. Can't get a line.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.647
It's okay, baby. We're here.

13:20.152 --> 13:23.068
Cops got the boy who did it.
Black kid, 14 years old.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.727
Shot him dead. Can't say I'm sorry.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.771
- Cops never mind shooting a black kid.
- And he didn't mind shooting this one.

13:29.949 --> 13:34.193
CBC, type and cross for two.
Get a unit of O-neg.

13:34.368 --> 13:36.573
Right foot's cold. No pulse.

13:36.744 --> 13:38.701
- Femoral artery.
- I'll call for x-rays.

13:38.871 --> 13:41.028
Sixteen-gauge Jamshidi.
One percent with epi.

13:41.205 --> 13:43.576
Faint pulse. Dynamap's not reading.

13:43.748 --> 13:45.325
One-twenty of saline.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.788
Fill these tubes.
Haleh, page Netzley.

13:51.962 --> 13:54.997
- Malik, you're gonna take her up to O.R.
- You got it.

13:55.173 --> 13:58.373
Dr. Greene, about closing Trauma,
Morgenstern gave the big "N-O. "

13:58.549 --> 14:01.632
- Get him on the phone for me.
- He went back up to Surgery.

14:01.801 --> 14:05.500
- All right, I'll find him.
- Mark, bingo on Omar.

14:08.596 --> 14:09.877
You got it?

14:10.931 --> 14:13.256
I want Daddy!

14:14.934 --> 14:17.222
- Ethylene glycol it is.
- What's that?

14:17.394 --> 14:20.596
Antifreeze. Get Renal down here stat.

14:20.771 --> 14:23.260
- Let's give him IV ethanol.
- We don't have any.

14:23.438 --> 14:24.766
What?

14:24.939 --> 14:27.608
I checked. Pharmacy's out.

14:27.775 --> 14:31.225
St. Luke's is sending us some,
but it won't be here for another hour.

14:31.401 --> 14:34.770
There's a bottle of bourbon
out in that shopping cart in the hall.

14:34.945 --> 14:37.945
- Bourbon?
-120 cc oral loading dose.

14:38.115 --> 14:40.070
Thirty cc's POQ one hour.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.071
Otherwise, he's got brain damage
and renal failure.

14:44.243 --> 14:46.946
Bourbon shooters it is.

14:59.751 --> 15:02.159
Labs are finally back
on that coma in 2. It's DKA.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.826
Start an insulin drip,
0. 1 per kilo per hour.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.337
- Mrs. Votey had another TIA.
- She's supposed to be at Medicine.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.424
- Dr. Randall said to discharge her.
- Discharge her? Is he nuts?

15:11.593 --> 15:14.924
Page him 911 and tell him
to get in here now.

15:15.344 --> 15:17.087
Here you go-

15:17.678 --> 15:20.169
Who let this dog in here?

15:20.347 --> 15:22.090
Try taking it away and it bites you.

15:22.265 --> 15:25.633
- That puker in 4 is still at it.
-10 of Compazine and a liter of saline.

15:25.809 --> 15:28.513
- Mr. Nathan in 5, he's-
- Morgenstern is up at the front.

15:28.686 --> 15:30.096
What about the turkey sandwich?

15:30.270 --> 15:33.021
- I can get it almost immediately.
- Who are we talking about?

15:33.188 --> 15:34.896
Mr. Nathan in 5, high white count...

15:35.065 --> 15:37.021
...temp's 101,
has left lower-quadrant pain.

15:37.191 --> 15:42.016
Probably diverticulitis. Give him amp,
gent, Flagyl and get an abdominal series.

15:42.193 --> 15:43.853
That's right. Bring him in.

15:44.028 --> 15:45.936
- Answering the phones?
- I'm here to help.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.151
Then why don't you close up
the Trauma?

15:48.322 --> 15:49.436
Sorry, Mark.

15:49.614 --> 15:52.283
County's looking for excuses
to put us out of business.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.236
Well, it's 10:30. We've got
enough business to last a year.

15:55.409 --> 15:58.860
-32 in the ER, 49 in the waiting room.
- Look, Mark, I'm sorry.

15:59.037 --> 16:01.243
Got a little Benton fracas in Trauma 2.

16:01.413 --> 16:04.863
Board of Commissioners wants to close
an ER and save $80 million a year.

16:05.041 --> 16:08.621
Every time we close, we're saying
that we're not capable of providing.

16:08.793 --> 16:12.705
Well, we're not. I now have
nine ICU patients draining my staff...

16:12.878 --> 16:16.162
...we've no monitored beds.
Here are the films on Robinson.

16:16.339 --> 16:19.209
I can't even help half
the patients here. It's insane.

16:19.382 --> 16:21.374
I talked to the critical care
coordinators.

16:21.550 --> 16:25.250
We move six patients from ICU
to Telemetry, but we're staying open.

16:25.427 --> 16:27.384
So what? He's oxygenating well.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.878
The tube heads medially,
striking the mediastinum.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.254
Peter, Shelly.

16:31.431 --> 16:33.719
- Why didn't you page me?
- Shelly's handling it.

16:33.890 --> 16:35.597
- I'm on call for Trauma.
- We didn't need you.

16:35.766 --> 16:38.683
- If you don't want help during-
- Gentlemen, please. Ladies!

16:40.061 --> 16:42.432
I don't hear anybody helping here.
What's going on?

16:42.604 --> 16:46.268
Third-year Surgical Resident Leung
placed the chest tube anteriorly.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.104
- Which has relieved the pneumothorax.
- But will not drain the hemothorax.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.102
Which can be repositioned
when we prep.

16:52.319 --> 16:54.524
Excellent idea! Let's all scrub in.

16:54.695 --> 16:56.901
Come on, folks. Let's go.

16:57.447 --> 17:01.229
- If you need anything, give me a call.
- How about a turkey sandwich?

17:01.406 --> 17:05.866
Too late. Cafeteria closes
at 10 now. County cutbacks.

17:06.035 --> 17:09.402
It's a piece of cartilage that doesn't
turn to bone until you're grown-up.

17:09.579 --> 17:13.112
- Dr. Greene.
- Carter. Chloe.

17:13.289 --> 17:17.415
Hi, Mark. I came here to see Susie,
but John says she's not on tonight.

17:17.583 --> 17:18.828
No, she isn't.

17:19.001 --> 17:21.207
Chloe was curious
about how to read an x-ray.

17:21.377 --> 17:24.128
I guess the interest in medicine
must run in the family.

17:24.296 --> 17:25.540
Yeah, right.

17:25.713 --> 17:30.622
Junior gymnast in 5. Fractured patella.
Time to break the bad news.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.878
That hand is so little.

17:35.052 --> 17:38.301
- Look at that.
- It's probably 4 or 5 years old.

17:38.471 --> 17:42.302
Little Susie's hand
is about that big, right?

17:46.851 --> 17:50.383
So Susie probably told you
what's going on with us.

17:50.561 --> 17:52.682
Yeah, she mentioned some things.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.260
I understand why she's upset with me.

17:55.439 --> 17:58.474
I never thought I could change,
why should she?

17:58.650 --> 18:02.812
I just want her to see that things are
different now, that I'm different now.

18:02.985 --> 18:06.518
- Did she tell you that I'm engaged?
- No, she didn't.

18:08.989 --> 18:13.530
He's a great guy. Steady.
He's as smart as Susie is.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.612
He's the only person, besides Susie,
who's ever taken the time with me...

18:17.785 --> 18:20.738
...to get to know me, you know...

18:20.913 --> 18:26.367
...that thought that there was
something in me worth finding out.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.829
It's really busy out there.
I gotta get back to work.

18:30.001 --> 18:33.334
Hey, Mark.
The thing is, I really miss her.

18:33.504 --> 18:34.783
I'm sure you do.

18:34.963 --> 18:39.919
I know it's hard, but as far as babies go,
Little Susie's doing great.

18:40.091 --> 18:43.043
Yeah. I miss her too.

18:50.138 --> 18:53.304
Jerry, put out a page on Steve Flint.

18:53.474 --> 18:55.098
How's our score?

18:55.266 --> 18:57.673
Bleak, bleaker, bleakest.

18:57.851 --> 18:59.926
No, wait.
We can mark this one off.

19:00.103 --> 19:04.598
Omar Gandera. Renal finally got here.
They're gonna take him upstairs.

19:04.772 --> 19:07.856
- Did you call Psych for him?
- They said to call back in a week.

19:08.025 --> 19:11.604
Great. Kid OD'd on antifreeze
and Psych can't quite fit him in.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.566
Exam 2's open.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.692
Good work, Chuny.

19:15.861 --> 19:20.153
- Somebody help me, please!
- Park that guy. Jerry, clear Trauma 2.

19:20.322 --> 19:22.362
- What happened?
- It's his chest!

19:22.533 --> 19:24.110
- What's your name?
- Corky.

19:24.284 --> 19:27.319
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but my dad is really sick.

19:27.494 --> 19:29.451
Was he vomiting blood?
It's on your shirt.

19:29.620 --> 19:30.651
No, I just cut myself.

19:30.829 --> 19:32.323
- What have we got?
- A possible Ml.

19:32.497 --> 19:34.535
- What's your father's name?
- Louis Etheridge.

19:34.705 --> 19:37.161
Louis? Louis? Mr. Etheridge?

19:38.750 --> 19:41.915
- Is he on any medications?
- I don't know. Maybe.

19:44.086 --> 19:45.331
- Air.
- Tachy at 120.

19:45.504 --> 19:47.994
- BP, 160 palp.
- EKG, portable chest.

19:48.173 --> 19:50.129
ABG, first-day CCU labs.

19:50.299 --> 19:54.377
Fifteen liters of O-2, four of MS,
titrate a nitroglycerine drip.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.757
- O-2 sat's 100.
- Are you nauseous?

19:56.928 --> 19:59.500
Yes. Please help me.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.927
- Inferior Ml?
- Has he had any heart trouble?

20:03.097 --> 20:05.339
No, that's not it.

20:05.515 --> 20:07.971
What is it, Corky?
It's okay to tell us.

20:08.142 --> 20:11.890
Dr. Greene? Why the hell did you pull me
down here in the middle of the night?

20:12.062 --> 20:14.848
Wait outside, Dr. Randall.
What's wrong with your father?

20:15.021 --> 20:17.511
- I need to talk to you.
- In a minute!

20:18.274 --> 20:20.681
- Corky?
- I don't know. He's just sick!

20:22.235 --> 20:25.021
Double lumen IVs.
Get a TPA tray.

20:25.194 --> 20:28.360
Let me know when the 12-lead's done.

20:29.197 --> 20:31.651
You got me out of bed
at midnight for no reason.

20:31.823 --> 20:36.283
- Your patient's just around the corner.
- I ordered her discharged hours ago.

20:36.451 --> 20:40.032
She's had three TIAs in two days.
She needs to be admitted.

20:40.203 --> 20:43.820
Stroke Council, AHA,
1995 recommendations:

20:43.998 --> 20:46.748
Hospitalize for four or more TIAs
in a two-week period.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.869
Or for findings suggesting
a worsening course. I know it.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.082
Her HMO will not authorize
her admission.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.250
She's one of your HMO patients.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.827
They're the only ones
who have patients anymore.

20:57.004 --> 21:00.288
So we wait till she strokes out
so they can keep their costs down?

21:00.465 --> 21:03.963
You don't have to wait for anything.
She is discharged.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.760
That migraine in 4 is still complaining.

21:11.931 --> 21:15.298
Try a milligram of DHE
and 10 of Reglan.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.143
- What's the story?
- His father's an alcoholic.

21:18.309 --> 21:21.059
His mother has been putting
Antabuse in his father's coffee.

21:21.227 --> 21:23.978
While he's still drinking?
And not telling him?

21:24.146 --> 21:27.311
So he's still drinking and now
he's having an Antabuse reaction.

21:27.481 --> 21:30.896
That could have been fatal.
The kid knew all along? Hey, Corky!

21:31.067 --> 21:32.774
Mark, the kid's scared enough, okay?

21:32.943 --> 21:34.899
He should be.
His father could have died.

21:37.404 --> 21:40.108
Call the mother and get her in here.

21:40.281 --> 21:43.364
Excuse me, doctor. My son's hand.
It really is a bad cut.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.856
Your son has been triaged
as a minor injury.

21:46.033 --> 21:47.942
There are more urgent cases
ahead of you.

21:48.118 --> 21:50.324
You have to wait in the waiting room.

21:50.495 --> 21:52.569
I asked you to keep
these people out of here.

21:52.746 --> 21:56.078
Now, I am running over to Doc's
to pick up my sandwich, okay?

21:56.248 --> 22:00.244
I'll be back in two minutes.
Get this dead guy out of here.

22:12.883 --> 22:16.795
Give me that!
Call for help, okay?

22:19.929 --> 22:22.300
Hang on! I'm gonna get you out!

22:23.181 --> 22:25.007
Hang on!

22:26.391 --> 22:28.383
Hang on!

22:43.150 --> 22:47.360
Leita! If you just crawl out the window,
we can get you out.

22:47.528 --> 22:48.691
Anything?

22:48.863 --> 22:51.779
We're waiting for the other unit
to show up with the equipment.

22:51.948 --> 22:54.782
- Get the mother and daughter out.
- Her mother's unconscious.

22:54.950 --> 22:58.365
Tell her to grab your hand.
You can pull her out.

23:02.330 --> 23:03.870
I got it!

23:07.624 --> 23:08.821
I'll try to get in!

23:11.835 --> 23:15.083
- Come over to this side!
- All right. Hold it.

23:23.175 --> 23:25.665
I can't reach her!

23:28.178 --> 23:32.505
Let me get in. Grab my hand!
Come on, grab my hand!

23:32.680 --> 23:34.174
- Grab my hand.
- Get out of there.

23:34.472 --> 23:36.595
- I can grab ahold of her.
- Let me get in there.

23:36.766 --> 23:40.015
- I almost got her hand.
- Doc, I can get her out of there, okay?

23:40.185 --> 23:42.177
Move!

23:43.186 --> 23:45.855
Let me get her out, okay?

23:49.524 --> 23:54.350
We'll bring her in. Why don't you go
dry off. Get the Trauma rooms ready.

24:01.865 --> 24:03.903
Jerry?

24:04.574 --> 24:07.194
- I wouldn't ask if I were you.
- Jerry.

24:07.367 --> 24:12.028
Folding chairs for the waiting room.
They were ordered four hours ago.

24:12.203 --> 24:14.824
Let me know when those
accident victims get in.

24:14.997 --> 24:18.246
I'm gonna go grab
some coffee and dry scrubs.

24:18.416 --> 24:21.249
And clear those Trauma rooms.

24:27.546 --> 24:29.538
You don't have any coffee filters,
do you?

24:29.714 --> 24:30.793
Are you kidding?

24:30.965 --> 24:34.712
No. And we can't even do
the folded paper towel trick.

24:38.052 --> 24:40.589
Mr. Carter, you are in luck.

24:40.762 --> 24:43.716
Now, if we had a hair dryer,
it'd really be our lucky day.

24:43.889 --> 24:45.134
How do you do this?

24:45.307 --> 24:49.136
You gotta get the coffee grounds out
without ripping the paper.

24:49.308 --> 24:52.926
No, I mean this. Patients stacked up
everywhere and no end in sight.

24:53.103 --> 24:55.059
It's like the O'Hare
of emergency rooms.

24:55.229 --> 25:00.981
It was a lot easier when I was younger.
I was newly married, I'd just had a baby.

25:01.149 --> 25:04.517
Jennifer used to come in the middle
of the night with chicken sandwiches.

25:04.693 --> 25:06.769
She'd have Rachel in the car seat.
We'd picnic...

25:06.945 --> 25:09.898
...between the waiting-to-be-sutured
and the bounced-back migraine.

25:10.072 --> 25:13.485
- I guess it helped, having a family.
- Yeah. Yeah, it did.

25:17.450 --> 25:20.023
What are you gonna do?

25:23.121 --> 25:24.698
That is really bad.

25:26.331 --> 25:28.655
I'm gonna go change.

25:28.833 --> 25:32.580
That's a lovely little pup
you got there, Mrs...

25:32.751 --> 25:36.997
Excuse me, Ms. Decksley.
Absolutely charming.

25:37.171 --> 25:39.742
Hey, Stinky,
want a few little stitches?

25:39.922 --> 25:43.753
- Shut that yappy little mouth of yours?
- You're not a dog-lover, huh?

25:43.924 --> 25:48.003
This is not a dog, it's a small,
furry object suitable for punting.

25:48.177 --> 25:50.418
I bet you can't get him
over that desk back there.

25:50.596 --> 25:54.970
- Don't tempt me.
- But tempting is what I do for a living.

25:55.139 --> 25:58.259
- I'm a lap dancer.
- Okay.

25:58.433 --> 26:01.599
So I hooked up with this
polyester guy tonight.

26:01.769 --> 26:06.927
And I slipped right off his knee and bam!
Sliced my butt on his spurs.

26:07.104 --> 26:09.725
Why would you wear boots
with polyester?

26:09.898 --> 26:11.689
I don't think I would.

26:11.858 --> 26:16.150
Are you gonna stitch me up next?
Because this cut really stings.

26:16.319 --> 26:19.272
- You want something for the pain?
- Drugs? Sure.

26:25.491 --> 26:26.819
Any word from outside?

26:26.992 --> 26:28.984
They radioed over.
Probably be 10 minutes.

26:29.161 --> 26:32.242
Jerry, call ICU. This ventilator guy
has been down here for days.

26:32.411 --> 26:35.577
Do you want me to page Benton
for that rule-out appy in 4?

26:35.747 --> 26:38.699
No, I'll check it out.
Lydia, get those labs on Cromley.

26:38.873 --> 26:41.957
I thought you were trying
to get that girl out.

26:42.125 --> 26:44.876
I can't even get the lab
to get a CBC in under three hours...

26:45.044 --> 26:48.459
...I can't get an x-ray in under two
or any ICU beds to open up.

26:48.630 --> 26:50.705
Mark, Jennifer's on the phone.

26:52.382 --> 26:54.338
- Jen, what's up?
- They brought Rachel home.

26:54.509 --> 26:56.665
- She's not feeling well.
- It's 1 in the morning.

26:56.842 --> 26:59.795
- They drove her back from the lake?
- Her stomach hurts.

26:59.970 --> 27:03.171
- Stomachache and what else?
- She threw up.

27:03.347 --> 27:06.631
Does she have a temperature?
Maybe it's altitude sickness.

27:06.807 --> 27:11.681
How do I know where the lake is?
You didn't even tell me she was going.

27:11.852 --> 27:16.062
Jen, I don't want to fight right now.
Listen, just put Rachel in bed.

27:16.230 --> 27:19.645
Keep her on clear fluids
and I'll call you in the morning.

27:19.815 --> 27:22.980
What do you want me
to do from down here?

27:23.150 --> 27:25.722
Well, I'm sorry you called too.

27:25.901 --> 27:28.818
Jerry, get Carter in here.

27:30.738 --> 27:32.979
- She'll be okay.
- Get this out of here.

27:33.156 --> 27:34.899
- Do you want me to page Benton?
- Yeah.

27:35.074 --> 27:37.315
The ankle's deformed.
No cap refill or pulses.

27:37.492 --> 27:39.567
BP's 80 palp. Pulse, 110.

27:39.743 --> 27:43.443
- Hey, doc, listen.
- Fracture dislocation. We need to reduce.

27:43.621 --> 27:44.818
Let's sedate her.

27:44.997 --> 27:49.323
Prep 35 migs Ketamine, 0.3 atropine.

27:49.499 --> 27:53.744
- I was just trying to get her out of it.
- Start another line. Half a gram of Ancef.

27:55.419 --> 27:59.001
CBC, Chem-7, UA, portable chest
and get an ankle.

27:59.171 --> 28:01.543
We got her out, damn it.

28:03.757 --> 28:05.999
Pulse, 140. BP, 90/60.

28:06.175 --> 28:09.673
Probable flail chest but good bilateral
breath sounds. Fractured left femur.

28:09.845 --> 28:11.837
Abdomen's rigid, x-rays on the way.

28:12.013 --> 28:13.969
- O-2 sat, 90.
- Blood ordered?

28:14.139 --> 28:16.509
Two units O-neg are up,
type and crossed for eight.

28:16.681 --> 28:19.254
Atropine, now.
Good work, Carter.

28:19.433 --> 28:23.015
- Prep for a lavage. You okay with that?
- I'm okay with that, yeah.

28:23.185 --> 28:25.177
Clear!

28:25.354 --> 28:28.519
Grab a C-spine and
a post-intubation chest next door.

28:28.689 --> 28:31.013
Ketamine's onboard. She's out.
Wanna wait for the films?

28:31.190 --> 28:34.191
No, let's do it. Countertraction.

28:36.444 --> 28:39.016
- That's it. Back in.
- She's coding!

28:39.196 --> 28:42.396
Where the hell's Benton? Page him, stat!

28:42.572 --> 28:45.441
All right, everybody off!

28:45.615 --> 28:47.572
- Okay, sinus brady.
- Mig of atropine.

28:47.742 --> 28:50.029
- Mix up dopamine.
- I paged him 911.

28:50.201 --> 28:52.407
Muffled heart sounds.
Neck vein distension.

28:52.578 --> 28:53.609
And another pulse.

28:53.787 --> 28:56.194
Thoracotomy tray.
Chuny, do compression.

28:56.372 --> 29:00.368
- Tamponade?
- Yeah. It could be a cardiac laceration.

29:01.417 --> 29:02.696
10 blade.

29:03.335 --> 29:05.540
- Did you page him?
- Twice.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.619
- Rib spreader.
- O-neg. Four more units.

29:07.794 --> 29:10.167
Throw them on the infuser.

29:15.133 --> 29:18.382
Sac's tense with blood. Metz!

29:22.054 --> 29:24.461
- She's bleeding out.
- Rib punctured the heart.

29:24.639 --> 29:27.722
Keep your finger over the hole
and do compressions.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.048
Should we wait for Benton?

29:31.560 --> 29:34.049
Let's try a 16 Foley, 30 cc balloon.

29:34.228 --> 29:35.638
- Foley?
- Clamp the end.

29:35.812 --> 29:39.558
And saline, not air.
Last thing she needs is an air embolism.

29:39.731 --> 29:42.849
- She's in fib.
- Internal paddles.

29:43.024 --> 29:46.024
One second.
Carter, pay attention.

29:46.193 --> 29:49.857
Catheter is going into
the hole in the heart.

29:50.029 --> 29:53.361
- Okay. Now fill the balloon.
- Two units O-neg in.

29:56.158 --> 29:58.233
Excellent.

29:58.742 --> 30:00.734
Now, traction.

30:03.370 --> 30:05.658
- What have we got?
- Charging.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.821
Charge 20.

30:08.664 --> 30:10.490
Zapping.

30:10.916 --> 30:13.489
- Sinus.
- Got a pulse.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.158
Let's get her up to the O.R.

30:20.381 --> 30:22.621
Where have you been?
We have a double trauma...

30:22.799 --> 30:24.209
...and you don't even respond?

30:24.383 --> 30:26.504
I was closing
on a mesenteric infarction.

30:26.675 --> 30:29.295
With how many Residents
who could've?

30:29.468 --> 30:32.422
- It was my surgery. I was busy.
- No, no, Peter.

30:32.595 --> 30:36.971
Down here is busy. In there is busy. In
there is where we ignore everything else.

30:37.140 --> 30:41.302
I ignore my patients for in there. I ignore
my child, my marriage for in there.

30:41.476 --> 30:44.393
Don't ever pull this again!

30:52.190 --> 30:54.312
Maybe the rain
will keep the people home.

30:54.483 --> 30:55.893
I thought it stopped raining.

30:57.777 --> 30:59.520
Nope.

30:59.695 --> 31:01.686
- Going...
- Going...

31:01.862 --> 31:03.689
Gone.

31:03.864 --> 31:05.903
- Is there a problem?
-2:00.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.315
- Bars are closing.
- They're getting in their cars.

31:08.491 --> 31:10.116
- Going too fast.
- Swerving.

31:10.284 --> 31:12.526
- Crashing.
- Paramedics are rolling out.

31:12.703 --> 31:16.284
- Scooping them up.
- And dropping them off on our doorstep.

31:16.455 --> 31:19.656
Dr. Greene, that was a 911 call
from our waiting room.

31:19.831 --> 31:21.907
- It's a jungle out there.
- I know.

31:22.083 --> 31:24.952
Drs. Lewis, Ross, Weaver
and Treloggen will be on...

31:25.126 --> 31:29.787
...in four hours and 58 minutes.
They will not be pleased.

31:29.962 --> 31:33.296
By the way, Jerry,
that light bulb's out.

31:33.882 --> 31:36.455
- Did you discharge that ankle sprain?
- About an hour ago.

31:36.634 --> 31:39.586
- The rule-out Ml in 4?
- Cardiology took him up.

31:39.761 --> 31:42.465
- What about that kid with the cut hand?
- With the mother?

31:42.638 --> 31:44.758
- Yeah.
- No, he's still in the Suture Room.

31:46.681 --> 31:50.546
There's a metallic foreign body
of 14 millimeters...

31:50.725 --> 31:54.139
...located one centimeter medial
to the distal femoral condyle.

31:54.310 --> 31:55.555
Morning, Harry.

31:55.728 --> 31:58.644
- Labs back on that OD in 6.
- Excellent! Stick them on the chart.

31:58.814 --> 32:00.722
Films are back
on that busted collarbone.

32:00.898 --> 32:02.937
Excellent. Stick them on the chart.

32:06.652 --> 32:09.436
- Mrs. Huggins.
- This is my son, Danny.

32:09.611 --> 32:11.603
- Hello, Danny.
- Hi.

32:13.613 --> 32:15.771
- I need to see you a minute.
- Can't it wait?

32:15.948 --> 32:17.986
No, I don't think so.

32:19.909 --> 32:21.984
Excuse me.

32:24.245 --> 32:26.237
- Why Trauma 1?
- She's not doing so well.

32:26.413 --> 32:27.657
There are no exam rooms.

32:27.831 --> 32:30.368
- Is her son with her?
- Yeah.

32:33.251 --> 32:36.452
Carol, why don't you
take Corky outside.

32:36.627 --> 32:39.626
- You drink coffee yet?
- He's not supposed to, but he does.

32:39.796 --> 32:42.333
Me too. Come on, let's go get a cup.

32:44.006 --> 32:45.334
I'm Dr. Greene.

32:45.507 --> 32:48.922
Corky didn't tell you about his father
because I told him not to.

32:49.093 --> 32:52.508
I told him not to tell anybody.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.844
His condition tonight was very serious.

32:56.014 --> 33:00.922
Antabuse is a deterrent to alcohol.
Mixing them can be fatal.

33:03.268 --> 33:06.765
It's not that I want him to die.

33:06.936 --> 33:10.518
It's just that when he drinks,
it can get pretty bad.

33:12.231 --> 33:17.188
There's blood on Corky's shirt.
Does your husband beat him as well?

33:17.360 --> 33:21.308
No. Corky got in the middle.
I think it's from my nose.

33:23.071 --> 33:27.114
There are places you can go,
Mrs. Etheridge.

33:27.281 --> 33:31.692
Shelters where you
and your son can be safe.

33:31.868 --> 33:33.860
I know.

33:36.329 --> 33:41.866
In cases of domestic violence
I'm legally obligated to inform the police.

33:44.417 --> 33:47.037
I know that too.

33:58.801 --> 34:01.505
Jerry, call the police.
Domestic violence case.

34:01.677 --> 34:03.052
Sure.

34:03.220 --> 34:06.054
Carol, order a facial series
and clean up the abrasions.

34:06.222 --> 34:08.047
Okay.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.850
Did he want to talk about it?
Say anything?

34:16.395 --> 34:19.347
No. Not a word.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.192
Bend your finger.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.525
- He was helping me hang a mirror.
- It weighed a ton.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.937
Needless to say, we dropped it.

34:36.114 --> 34:39.898
- Seven years of bad luck.
- I don't believe in that stuff.

34:40.074 --> 34:42.483
It's fairly deep,
but there's no tendon damage.

34:42.659 --> 34:44.320
See? That's good luck.

34:44.495 --> 34:46.652
- What time did it happen?
- After dinner.

34:46.829 --> 34:49.402
After Hard Copy, Mom.

34:50.915 --> 34:54.283
- Unfortunately, I can't stitch it up.
- What?

34:55.500 --> 34:58.786
After six hours,
the risk of infection is too high.

34:58.961 --> 35:02.246
We've been here half the night
and now you can't even do anything?

35:02.422 --> 35:06.121
I'll put him on antibiotics. Come back
in three days for a delayed closure.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.169
Do we have to wait again?

35:11.427 --> 35:16.004
- Did they admit that bowel obstruction?
- He's under the knife as we speak.

35:16.179 --> 35:18.088
Good work.

35:19.765 --> 35:24.426
Whoever's got gastrointestinal distress,
rise and shine.

35:24.602 --> 35:26.807
- Loretta.
- Hi, Dr. Greene.

35:26.978 --> 35:29.931
- These gurneys aren't bad.
- Are you all right?

35:30.105 --> 35:34.183
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, no.
You know, of course, I'm not.

35:34.358 --> 35:36.848
It's Jimmy. He's got a fever.
He's been throwing up.

35:37.025 --> 35:41.068
- Come on, baby. Wake up.
- Swing your feet over there.

35:41.236 --> 35:44.022
- How are you doing there?
- I puked twice in the waiting room.

35:44.197 --> 35:45.607
He's kind of embarrassed.

35:45.781 --> 35:48.946
There were six other men
in line for the bathroom.

35:49.116 --> 35:51.606
Yeah, it's a little crowded out there.
Sorry.

35:51.785 --> 35:55.449
Your stomach feels okay?
Open your mouth.

35:55.954 --> 35:59.119
There you go. Tongue out.

35:59.289 --> 36:03.949
I don't think it's anything serious.
Your garden-variety 24-hour virus.

36:04.124 --> 36:07.788
Nothing by mouth for six hours.
Then, sips of clear liquids.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.660
If he keeps those down, you can try
a little toast and applesauce for dinner.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.838
- Thanks, Dr. Greene.
- I'm sorry you had to wait so long.

36:15.007 --> 36:19.418
It wasn't so bad. We got in
before a lot of the others did.

36:22.511 --> 36:25.629
- You wanna help me grab some stuff?
- Sure. What do you need?

36:25.805 --> 36:28.295
Gauze, syringes, Ace wraps...

36:28.473 --> 36:31.804
...saline, suture sets, eye patches.

36:33.726 --> 36:35.136
-4-0 nylon.
- Check.

36:35.310 --> 36:37.267
- Skin staplers.
- Check.

36:37.436 --> 36:39.309
- Tetanus boosters.
- Double check.

36:39.479 --> 36:44.720
Haleh, Lydia, what are you doing
for the next couple of hours?

36:49.652 --> 36:52.901
- He's kidding, right?
- Can we treat them without a chart?

36:53.071 --> 36:57.529
- How's the hospital going to bill them?
- Does that metal detector work?

36:57.698 --> 37:01.908
- You're not making an announcement?
- And start a stampede?

37:02.076 --> 37:04.827
These are some
of the more minor cases.

37:04.994 --> 37:10.283
Explain to them what we are doing.
No labs or x-rays without a chart.

37:11.706 --> 37:13.117
Richard Tomco?

37:15.001 --> 37:17.786
Anderson? Anderson?

37:20.629 --> 37:23.498
Mark, we know this guy.
What do you want this time, Ricky?

37:23.672 --> 37:24.834
Percocet? Demerol?

37:25.006 --> 37:26.832
No. I'm telling you,
this time it really hurts.

37:27.007 --> 37:30.506
Yeah, it's abscessed.
Pretty nasty in there.

37:30.676 --> 37:33.593
Five cc's Marcaine, 27-gauge needle.

37:33.762 --> 37:36.299
Have any allergies?

37:39.473 --> 37:41.844
Open up.

37:42.016 --> 37:45.384
You're gonna be numb
for about six hours.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.725
Dental clinic's on the second floor.
Opens at 9.

37:48.895 --> 37:51.978
- Do I need stitches?
- No. When was your last tetanus shot?

37:52.147 --> 37:54.553
- Probably high school.
- Okay. We'll give you one now.

37:54.732 --> 37:56.191
But I want you to come back...

37:56.358 --> 37:59.477
...if there's any redness
or swelling or red streaks, okay?

37:59.652 --> 38:02.735
Impetigo. Write him for Keflex.

38:02.904 --> 38:06.686
Uticaria, 0.2 Susphrine sub-Q.

38:07.698 --> 38:10.863
Subungual hematoma. Drain it.

38:11.034 --> 38:13.819
Do you think he's, you know,
lost his grip on reality?

38:13.993 --> 38:15.784
No. I think he's having fun.

38:15.952 --> 38:20.115
Vaginal bleeding. Haleh, do you think we
can do a pelvic in the waiting room?

38:20.288 --> 38:24.996
Just kidding. Take her back,
spin a crit, dip a urine and do an ICON.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.954
- Sudden-onset blindness.
- Woke up this morning...

38:28.127 --> 38:30.452
...couldn't see a thing.

38:30.795 --> 38:32.124
Carter?

38:32.296 --> 38:36.162
Differential includes retinal detachment,
central retinal artery occlusion, CVA.

38:36.341 --> 38:39.707
Diabetic retinopathy,
retinitis, macular degeneration.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.800
She's too calm.
I think it's psychogenic.

38:42.969 --> 38:46.881
Lydia, try and find that optokinetic drum.

38:47.054 --> 38:50.552
If the eyes move when
the drum spins, she's faking.

38:58.729 --> 39:01.479
Molly and Sarah were roughhousing.
Don't buy bunk beds.

39:01.647 --> 39:04.315
And Molly got pulled off the top.

39:04.482 --> 39:09.556
Your arm hurts, Molly?
Did you hit your head or anything else?

39:09.735 --> 39:12.059
- Want me to order an x-ray?
- No, we don't need it.

39:12.236 --> 39:15.818
Ms. Taylor, one of the ligaments
in Molly's elbow slipped out of place.

39:15.988 --> 39:20.815
I'm gonna fix it. She's gonna cry,
but it'll only hurt for a second.

39:23.243 --> 39:25.567
Jeffrey fed his brother
a couple button batteries.

39:25.745 --> 39:26.943
- You sure?
- Yeah.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.740
- I saw the second one go down myself.
- Why'd you do that?

39:29.914 --> 39:31.988
- Because he likes them.
- He likes them.

39:32.165 --> 39:33.742
He's gonna need some x-rays.

39:33.915 --> 39:37.165
If they're stuck in his esophagus,
there's potential for a perforation.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.290
Carter? Carter, hold on for a second.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.123
Can I borrow this?

39:42.296 --> 39:44.287
Try that.

39:50.384 --> 39:52.790
It's below the diaphragm.
No need to worry.

39:52.969 --> 39:55.091
Check his stool.
They'll pass in a day or two.

39:55.263 --> 39:57.253
That's great. Thank you.

40:02.641 --> 40:04.717
He's right. Psychogenic.

40:04.892 --> 40:07.892
Lois, I'll give you some eye drops.

40:08.061 --> 40:12.271
I think they'll help your vision.
Just lean your head back.

40:12.439 --> 40:14.929
Always give the patient a way out.

40:16.316 --> 40:19.600
One more. Okay. That ought to do it.

40:19.777 --> 40:23.854
Oh, yeah. I can see everything.
It's still a little blurry, though.

40:24.028 --> 40:27.313
By the time you get home,
everything should be fine.

40:27.489 --> 40:31.615
Mark, Mrs. Lipshultz,
83, flushed, headachy.

40:34.118 --> 40:36.324
And nauseous.

40:36.494 --> 40:38.320
Sorry.

40:38.496 --> 40:43.452
That's all right. They're Doug's shoes.
Give her 10 of Compazine, I.M.

40:46.084 --> 40:49.000
What's bothering you, Mr. Buchanan?

40:49.169 --> 40:51.623
Where does it hurt?

40:52.879 --> 40:54.455
Here.

40:57.465 --> 40:59.706
How you doing, Mr. Buchanan?

41:01.009 --> 41:03.297
My back is killing me.

41:03.469 --> 41:06.303
- Not your shoulder?
- No, no. My back.

41:06.470 --> 41:10.550
BP both arms. Don't worry.
We're gonna take care of everything.

41:12.683 --> 41:15.054
Where can I get one of these things?

41:16.976 --> 41:20.344
Her arm feels absolutely fine.
What do you say?

41:20.520 --> 41:24.102
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

41:26.607 --> 41:29.940
We still have an eye pain,
a neck pain, an abdominal pain...

41:30.110 --> 41:33.975
- ... and a boil that needs to be lanced.
- Be there in a minute.

41:34.946 --> 41:36.985
I know it's early,
but I knew you'd be up.

41:37.156 --> 41:38.484
How did you know?

41:38.657 --> 41:41.821
Because Bananas in Pajamas is on.

41:41.991 --> 41:45.489
Don't turn it up, Rachel.
You'll wake up Mommy.

41:46.952 --> 41:52.657
I'm glad you're feeling better, sweetie.
I'll see you next weekend.

41:52.831 --> 41:54.657
- Love you.
- Love you too.

41:59.752 --> 42:01.910
- Breakfast?
- Thanks.

42:02.088 --> 42:04.079
- Breakfast?
- Thank you.

42:12.134 --> 42:14.090
Be careful. It's ugly out there.

42:14.260 --> 42:16.336
Not as ugly as it's been in here.
Good night.

42:16.512 --> 42:18.171
Good night.

42:19.222 --> 42:24.215
What a night! You ever have to
sleep in one of these things?

42:24.391 --> 42:30.179
I'll put your shoes by your locker.
Mine are probably dry by now.

42:30.354 --> 42:34.978
- Thanks for the great work, Carol.
- That's why they pay me the big bucks.

42:35.148 --> 42:39.191
Hey, Peter. We're gonna have
to find some way to work together.

42:39.359 --> 42:41.931
Yeah, I guess we are.

42:43.695 --> 42:45.153
How was dinner?

42:45.321 --> 42:48.155
- I fired him.
- What?

42:48.323 --> 42:50.611
I need a new lawyer.
The guy was a lightweight.

42:50.783 --> 42:54.197
He said that Chloe
could possibly have a case...

42:54.368 --> 42:59.655
...if in fact she does have a job...

42:59.829 --> 43:01.370
What do you think?

43:01.538 --> 43:05.949
I've seen her go through hundreds
of jobs. What am I supposed to think?

43:11.669 --> 43:13.745
- Hey, Kerry.
- Hi, Mark.

43:13.921 --> 43:16.411
I think I finally made sense
of that QA review.

43:16.590 --> 43:20.040
But you're on your way out.
We can go over it later.

43:20.216 --> 43:22.789
Thank you. I appreciate that.

43:23.386 --> 43:25.376
Good night.

43:32.139 --> 43:35.554
- I thought it would've stopped by now.
- Yeah.

43:37.393 --> 43:40.310
Tonight was great. The waiting room.

43:42.354 --> 43:45.520
When I started med school,
that's what I thought it would be like.

43:46.232 --> 43:48.224
Really helping people.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.684
At least, that's what I thought
it was supposed to be.

43:51.859 --> 43:54.563
That is what it's supposed to be.

43:57.905 --> 44:03.063
- What are you gonna do today, Carter?
- I don't know. What are you gonna do?

44:04.159 --> 44:05.902
I don't know.
