WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:10.635
[man] I'm a weirdo.
That's what everyone says.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.179
Sometimes, I don't know what people mean
when they say things,

00:13.346 --> 00:17.267
and that can make me feel alone even
when there are other people in the room.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.936
And all I can do is sit and twiddle,

00:20.020 --> 00:22.689
which is what I call
my self-stimulatory behavior,

00:22.772 --> 00:27.360
when I flick a pencil against
a rubber band at a certain frequency

00:27.444 --> 00:29.529
and think about all the things that
I could never do,

00:29.612 --> 00:34.075
like research penguins in Antarctica
or have a girlfriend.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.995
I don't know.
I'd like to go to Antarctica.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.872
It's quiet there...

00:39.831 --> 00:42.208
except in the rookeries,
where the penguins breed.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.294
[chuckles] Those aren't quiet. No, sir.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.088
I'm finished with my answer.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.215
Great.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.718
Almost done for today. Good session, Sam.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.970
I can see your bra. It's purple.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.140
[chuckles]

00:57.223 --> 01:01.061
Um, there was one more thing
I wanted to discuss.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.813
And I don't need your answer now,

01:03.897 --> 01:06.232
but I'm asking all my clients
if they'd be willing

01:06.316 --> 01:07.984
to donate their brains for research.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.611
[laughs]

01:09.694 --> 01:10.945
Donate my brain?

01:11.696 --> 01:13.865
- After  you die.
-Oh.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.160
Yeah. There's such a shortage
of brain matter available,

01:17.243 --> 01:19.829
and, you know,
there's no substitute for the real thing.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.997
[chuckles]

01:21.081 --> 01:23.249
Just think about it.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.586
-Okay.
-And, hey, Sam,

01:27.253 --> 01:29.923
what you said earlier
about having a girlfriend?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.383
People in the spectrum date, you know?

01:32.467 --> 01:36.137
You can try to find someone,
if you wanted to.

01:36.679 --> 01:39.182
-How?
-You just have to put yourself out there.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.184
Out where?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.021
[Sam]  Buses are okay,

01:45.104 --> 01:48.024
but I don't like the feeling
of the seat on my back,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.859
so I sit like this.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.653
I don't know how people stand it.

01:51.736 --> 01:55.281
Maybe they've developed thicker back skin
from riding the bus so much.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.660
There's a type of Antarctic cod
that has a special protein

01:58.743 --> 02:01.037
in its blood that stops it from freezing.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.206
[chuckles]  Antifreeze in fish.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.332
[laughs]

02:08.169 --> 02:10.547
I was just thinking about Antarctic cod.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.970
Antarctica is the most remote continent
on the planet.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.391
It has 90% of the world's ice,

02:21.474 --> 02:24.185
but it's considered a desert
because the annual rainfall

02:24.269 --> 02:25.687
is only about eight inches.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.232
You wouldn't think it was
a desert when you looked at it.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.943
That's why I like it.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.863
It's not what it looks like.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.158
[woman] Sam! Dinner!

02:38.241 --> 02:41.578
So, I ordered those T-shirts
that Sam likes, in bulk...

02:41.661 --> 02:43.454
you know, 100% cotton...

02:43.538 --> 02:48.001
and they switched them
to something that they called "tri-blend."

02:48.084 --> 02:52.422
So I called the company,
and I spoke to this woman named Rizwana.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.424
I think I was speaking with India.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.592
[man]
Mm-hmm.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.260
But, anyway, um...

02:57.343 --> 03:01.055
And she found a box of the old ones,

03:01.139 --> 03:02.724
and they sent them free of charge.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.101
-They're exactly the right kind.
-[man] Mm.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.061
Wow. That is a great story, Mom.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.438
Oh, don't be a dick, honey.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.149
So, Sam, how was your session
with Julia today?

03:11.232 --> 03:12.775
She wants me to donate my brain,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.444
but don't worry, it's after I die.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.447
What, like, for research?
That could be kind of cool.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.531
Absolutely not.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.825
And the queen has spoken.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.077
Well, it's gross, Casey.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.039
You tell Julia, "Thank you, but no."

03:26.122 --> 03:28.333
-[Sam] Okay.
-You're so easy to boss around.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.585
I don't care what happens
to my dead brain.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.171
It's either I give it to Julia,
or maggots eat it.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.089
If Mom wants maggots to eat it, fine.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.467
No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.551
Kind of is.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.220
I don't care. I'll be dead.

03:40.303 --> 03:43.431
Can we stop talking about you being dead?
You're not going anywhere.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.141
Wow, this chicken's really good, honey.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.851
Thanks. It's a dry rub.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.144
It's a good dry rub.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.272
Julia thinks that I should
put myself out there

03:51.356 --> 03:53.316
and find someone to have sex with.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.776
[laughs]

03:54.859 --> 03:56.778
She didn't say the sex part. I added that.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.154
[laughing]

04:04.202 --> 04:06.204
[theme music playing]

04:26.349 --> 04:28.977
-[school bell rings]
-[indistinct conversations]

04:33.773 --> 04:36.359
[Sam]  My school is crowded, noisy,

04:36.442 --> 04:37.986
and it smells weird,

04:38.069 --> 04:40.405
but it has one thing going for it:

04:40.488 --> 04:42.490
it has lots of girls.

04:42.573 --> 04:47.287
Well, I think every girl is pretty
in her own way,

04:47.370 --> 04:50.164
like a snowflake
in a seasonal Antarctic storm.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.807
[Sam]  But girls don't notice me at all.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.689
Thank you.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.944
Banged a veterinarian
I met online last night.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.613
She had a pet parrot that
repeated everything she said.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.908
"Do me, Brown Sugar!
Do me, Brown Sugar!"

05:26.409 --> 05:28.244
Oh, shit. I think she's racist.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.455
What kind of parrot?

05:30.538 --> 05:33.124
Oh, I don't know. The red rainbow one?

05:33.207 --> 05:35.543
-That's a scarlet macaw.
-Oh.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.550
Zahid...

05:43.676 --> 05:44.886
do you like dating girls?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.264
Yeah, dude. I like dating girls.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.186
[camera shutter clicks]

05:54.520 --> 05:55.605
What are you doing?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.191
Going online to try
and find a girl to date.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.734
That's hilarious. I'll help.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.987
Okay, finish this sentence:

06:03.071 --> 06:05.323
"I spend a lot of time thinking about..."

06:05.406 --> 06:06.657
Easy. Penguins.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.535
And, especially,
I'll say chinstrap penguins.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.579
They're my favorite bird,

06:11.662 --> 06:14.123
but all four types
of Antarctic penguins are good.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.252
Did you know early explorers thought they
were fish and classified them that way?

06:18.336 --> 06:20.088
Not birds, fish.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.841
I'm gonna put "sports."

06:23.925 --> 06:25.134
[woman] Hey, kids.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.469
What you doing?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.679
Casey's helping me sign up
for online dating,

06:28.763 --> 06:30.681
but hates all my answers, so she's lying.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.477
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.145
You're a little young for that.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.940
You know, I saw an episode on  20/20.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.276
There's actually something
called "catfishing,"

06:42.527 --> 06:45.571
-and it has nothing to do with fishing.
-Bye, Mom.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.660
Should we take another picture
with Edison?

06:50.743 --> 06:53.621
I read online that girls love animals.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.831
Maybe like this?

06:55.790 --> 06:58.459
I think this might go quicker
if you just leave.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.838
[sighs] Damn it.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.174
Careful. What are you doing?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.717
Honey, can you get that for me?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.763
-Which one?
-Three to five.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.975
This room, it's, like, so disorganized.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.477
-Such a mess.
-You okay?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.312
Yes, fine. Totally fine.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.230
[sniffles]

07:19.313 --> 07:20.231
Yeah.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.818
Sam's gonna start dating,
so that's something.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.194
Do you remember these?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.988
-Sam's emotion cards?
-Yeah.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.323
"Someone's making this face,
they might be sad,

07:29.407 --> 07:31.033
so you should try
to be kind to them."

07:31.117 --> 07:33.911
A woman in the support group,
her son was just diagnosed,

07:33.995 --> 07:34.912
so I said I'd throw

07:34.996 --> 07:36.706
some things together.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.959
This was the exact face he made
when I surprised him with Mets tickets.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.919
-Remember that?
-Yeah, I do.

07:42.003 --> 07:45.173
I wanted us to just have one thing
in common.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.466
Just one thing.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.470
Me and my dad used to go
to the ball games all the time.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.474
I think it's all right that
Sam's gonna try to date.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.018
I mean, you and I weren't
much older when we met,

07:57.101 --> 07:58.978
and that was fun, right?
We had a good time.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.023
-Sam's not like us.
-I know, but he has to start...

08:02.106 --> 08:04.108
Do you know that every time
the phone rings, I jump?

08:04.692 --> 08:06.152
Every time.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.655
I think he's crossed the street again
with his eyes closed...

08:10.531 --> 08:12.533
or he had a freak-out in a store

08:12.617 --> 08:15.870
or he's hit a police officer.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.247
-Every time the phone rings.
-I know. I know.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.083
But maybe now it's time for us
to take a step back.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.628
Spend time together, just the two of us,

08:23.711 --> 08:26.547
you know, get back to where
we were before all of this.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.049
Maybe we go on a date.

08:29.008 --> 08:29.842
Hmm?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.719
Or we... we fool around.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.346
[scoffs, laughs]

08:33.429 --> 08:34.764
-Huh?
-Yeah, right.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.890
No?

08:35.973 --> 08:37.350
[laughs]

08:38.476 --> 08:39.602
Oh.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.479
You're serious.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.689
I'm not serious.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.441
-I'm sorry.
-I'm just playing.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.745
[Julia] Common traits
of autism spectrum disorder include

08:57.828 --> 09:00.248
repetitive behaviors,
difficulty socializing

09:00.331 --> 09:03.209
and persistent, intense preoccupations.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.963
I have a patient who came up
with 95 ways to cook an egg.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.676
Come on in.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.346
Please, sit.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.974
-Yeah, thanks.
-Oh.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.183
[chuckles nervously]

09:19.809 --> 09:21.894
Is everything okay with Sam?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.397
Oh, yes. It's fine.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.773
I just, um...

09:29.193 --> 09:31.529
Sam said you spoke to him about dating.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.446
[chuckles]

09:32.530 --> 09:34.824
He mentioned wanting a girlfriend,
so I thought...

09:34.907 --> 09:36.701
I appreciate you're trying to help,

09:36.784 --> 09:40.621
but all the things that make
my son's everyday life difficult...

09:40.705 --> 09:44.208
like reading social cues,
exchanging small talk...

09:44.292 --> 09:46.961
all the things I've helped him
navigate his entire life,

09:47.044 --> 09:48.421
are magnified in dating.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.256
Um...

09:50.965 --> 09:55.011
Dating is almost entirely
nonverbal communication,

09:55.094 --> 09:57.179
and Sam's the most literal
person I know.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.516
Yeah, and there are strategies
that I could teach him.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.601
Are there?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.771
Are there strategies
for when you get your heart broken?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.567
Sam is doing really well.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.153
I mean, we're 32 days
into his senior year,

10:12.236 --> 10:14.488
and he hasn't had a meltdown yet, so...

10:15.489 --> 10:16.741
I don't want to push him.

10:16.824 --> 10:20.119
I mean, relationships are hard enough
for neurotypicals.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.622
I don't want to put that kind
of pressure on my son.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.667
There was a study done
in Toronto a few years ago.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.630
Researchers found that only nine percent

10:30.713 --> 10:32.548
of adults with autism are married,

10:32.632 --> 10:34.508
not because they lack the desire,

10:34.592 --> 10:36.677
but because they don't know how to do it.

10:36.761 --> 10:40.014
Your son has the same desire
to be loved that we all do.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.891
Why shouldn't he pursue it?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.019
He's not ready yet.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.022
You know,
a lot of parents have a hard time

10:48.105 --> 10:49.899
as their kids become more independent.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.693
It's completely natural.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.945
So if you ever need someone to talk to,

10:55.029 --> 10:57.156
I can refer you to one of my colleagues.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.783
Oh, wow. No, um...

10:59.909 --> 11:01.369
[exhales]

11:01.452 --> 11:02.870
That won't be necessary.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.706
Thank you for your time.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.461
That's okay. I got it. Thanks so much.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.796
-Have a great day.
-Okay.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.096
[Sam]  When I'm learning something new,

11:20.179 --> 11:24.058

You're sensitive, and you're funny,

35:07.271 --> 35:10.274
and the woman who ends up
with you will be lucky.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.319
You want to marry your best friend.

35:14.654 --> 35:15.530
Edison?

35:15.613 --> 35:16.572
No.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.491
Not your turtle, Sam.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.993
You said my best friend.
He's my best friend.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.121
I just...

35:24.038 --> 35:28.292
I meant you want to be with someone
who appreciates you for what you are.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.797
You know, who loves all
the little odd things about you...

35:33.506 --> 35:34.590
who gets you.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.762
Penguins mate for life, you know?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.515
Yeah?

35:43.850 --> 35:45.184
Well, good for them.

35:46.853 --> 35:50.565
So, how are you feeling now?
Still ready to give up on dating?

35:50.648 --> 35:53.317
I don't know. My dad said to find someone

35:53.401 --> 35:56.571
who appreciates me for what I am,
which is a weirdo.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.614
We talked a lot.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.158
Glad to hear it.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.411
And that makes sense.
You're easy to talk to.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.291
Yeah.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.376
You're easy to talk to, too,

36:10.459 --> 36:13.671
which is good 'cause,
otherwise, you'd go broke.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.964
[chuckles]

36:18.259 --> 36:21.179
[Sam]  When a male gentoo penguin
chooses a mate,

36:21.262 --> 36:22.346
he makes an offering.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.682
He finds a pebble,

36:24.765 --> 36:27.101
often taking the time
to find the smoothest one,

36:27.185 --> 36:29.020
and presents it to the female.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.690
I'm a human,
so it would be weird to offer a pebble.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.233
Julia.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.197
-I've decided I want to give you my brain.
-[gasps] Really?

36:39.280 --> 36:40.448
After I die.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.950
Oh, Sam, that's so great.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.871
You're gonna help so many people.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.581
[chuckles]

36:48.664 --> 36:50.291
Good smile.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.751
It's not creepy at all.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.252
I've been practicing.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.503
Yeah, I can tell.

36:56.839 --> 36:59.425
[Sam]  If the female places the pebble
in her nest,

36:59.508 --> 37:01.219
she accepts him as a mate.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.846
And as you already know,
penguins mate for life.
