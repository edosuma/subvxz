Welcome back to
the Justice League audition.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.405
I'm Birdarang.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.140
And the competition
for our coveted spot

00:39.173 --> 00:40.341
on the Justice League

00:40.374 --> 00:42.476
is officially off the heezy, yo!

00:42.510 --> 00:45.346
Starfire's act sure
wasn't the cat's meow.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.449
Cyborg got jiggy
with the judges.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.520
All these fools
were just wiggity-wack.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.288
And of course, there was Robin.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.723
The sorest loser of all.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.558
I grew up in the circus!

00:58.626 --> 01:00.594
And Raven and her dad
got into it,

01:00.628 --> 01:03.697
big time, causing all sorts of
driggity-driggity drama!

01:03.731 --> 01:09.103
Let's see what happens next when
the audition continues. Right now!

01:09.137 --> 01:12.140
Ray-Ray, what are you gonna do
now that your dad ripped up

01:12.173 --> 01:14.308
your costume
and forbid you from dancing?

01:14.342 --> 01:17.278
Ha! He can't stop me
from doing what I love.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.153
Oh, dang!
This is gonna be good.

01:27.388 --> 01:31.225
Hi, I'm Raven
and I'm doing a dance.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.918
I'm in the final round!
I'm in the final round!

02:30.951 --> 02:33.954
Yeah, all right! Nice move, pal! Whoo!

02:33.987 --> 02:35.923
Love it!

02:35.956 --> 02:38.392
Well, Dad, what did you think?

02:38.426 --> 02:41.829
I think... I think...

02:41.862 --> 02:45.799
I think you're a fantastic
dancer, my little sweetiekins.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.736
Oh, so much feeling,
so much emotion!

02:48.769 --> 02:52.840
Oh, give your daddy a huggiepoo.

02:52.873 --> 02:53.674
Okay, that's enough.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.546
What? She gets voted in
for some lame dance?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.214
My act was way better than that!

03:00.248 --> 03:01.515
Dang!

03:01.549 --> 03:03.584
Hey! Stop filming
my private moments!

03:03.617 --> 03:06.320
Mans, you being
real jerky right now!

03:06.354 --> 03:07.888
And didn't you get
kicked off already?

03:07.921 --> 03:11.659
Yes, but I really feel like
I deserve a second chance.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.793
Or, does he?

03:12.826 --> 03:16.364
What? She gets voted in
for some lame dance?

03:16.397 --> 03:17.698
My act was way better than that!

03:17.731 --> 03:19.433
That was edited
to make me look bad!

03:19.467 --> 03:21.302
You have to give me
a second chance.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.437
They need to get to know
the real me!

03:23.471 --> 03:26.574
The one with an even
sadder back story than before.

03:26.607 --> 03:31.479
Coming up, we have a pity
party for Robin. Right now!

03:32.813 --> 03:33.681
My name is Robin

03:33.714 --> 03:35.849
and I didn't have
a regular childhood.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.486
I grew up on a farm
with my granpapi.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.355
It's hard work
tending the cornfields,

03:41.389 --> 03:44.425
especially on account of the
crows always stealing our crop.

03:44.458 --> 03:49.430
When the corn was gone, they went
and flew off with Grangrams.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.533
Dang! Sounds like you're
making all these up, yo.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.303
- No! It's all true!
- And very sad.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.805
Seemed like
things couldn't get any worse

03:57.838 --> 04:00.341
until one day,
a meteor came down

04:00.374 --> 04:03.043
and destroyed the farm.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.313
But if I win this competition,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.348
I can rebuild the family farm.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.784
When I think of everything my
old granpapi has done for me,

04:10.818 --> 04:13.554
it brings a tear to my eye.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.391
Oh, you poor little farmer boy.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.960
Thank you.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.396
Sounds like a truck load
of wick-wick-wack,

04:22.430 --> 04:23.797
but it was pretty tragic.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.966
So I guess you deserve
a second chance, bro.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.435
Yes!

04:29.002 --> 04:30.871
Hi! I'm back!

04:32.340 --> 04:34.442
This time, I will dazzle you

04:34.475 --> 04:37.378
with feats of magic.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.414
Hey, I haven't even started yet.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.682
Stop that.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.451
You can't just...

04:43.484 --> 04:44.685
Just let me do my act!

04:46.454 --> 04:48.622
Abracadabra!

04:50.758 --> 04:52.426
Abracadabra!

04:54.762 --> 04:56.497
Cadabra!

04:56.530 --> 04:58.866
Fly, you stupid bird, fly!

05:00.901 --> 05:02.035
Oh, oh. Okay, okay.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.637
Uh, for my next trick,

05:03.671 --> 05:05.906
I will make this $20 bill

05:05.939 --> 05:09.477
disappear and reappear
in your wallet.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.047
Go ahead, take a look.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.453
You can keep that.
Consider it,

05:19.487 --> 05:20.854
a bribe.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.725
You can't do this to me.
I need to re-build the farm!

05:27.428 --> 05:29.062
So, how'd it go, yo?

05:29.096 --> 05:31.565
These judges can't see talent.
I've got talent

05:31.599 --> 05:34.435
and good looks.
I'm the whole package.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.103
Look at me. Look at me!

05:36.136 --> 05:37.438
Okay!

05:37.471 --> 05:39.540
Coming up!

05:39.573 --> 05:41.375
We find out that if Beast Boy is
even going to bother to audition.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.610
Right now.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.979
Yo, yo, yo. I'm Beast Boy.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.416
And winning this competition has
always been my dream in life.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.551
- ♪ La, la, la ♪
- Actually that's not true.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.520
Am just here because my dude,
Cyborg is here.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.455
I'm a follower.
I'm not really proud of it

05:54.488 --> 05:55.756
but it's kind of my thing.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.526
Hey dudes.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.562
Madam-dude. I'm Beast Boy

06:01.595 --> 06:03.431
and this is my talent, yo.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.538
I's the milkman, yo!

06:10.571 --> 06:13.407
And youse gonna drink some milk!

06:13.441 --> 06:14.642
Moo-oo!

06:14.675 --> 06:15.943
Milk on your face.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.912
Milk on your face.

06:18.946 --> 06:19.980
Milk on your face.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.419
M... M... Milk on your face!

06:30.891 --> 06:31.659
Moo!

06:31.692 --> 06:35.028
Milk, it does a body good, fool!

06:36.797 --> 06:38.666
Tell us, what happened in there?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.834
Well, I don't thinks
the judges like milk.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.070
It's cool.
I don't drinks it myself.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.705
I'm a vegan. No big deal.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.874
It's not like any of us
are taking it seriously.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.543
One side!
Is it my turn? Is it my turn?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.011
Robin, tell us.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.846
What makes you think
the third time's the charm?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.549
Because I've got the spirit,
the never give-up attitude

06:55.583 --> 06:58.185
and crutches!

06:58.218 --> 06:59.419
Crutches?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.190
Hello, my name is Robin.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.592
Tiny Robin.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.561
I was born in the year 1843.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.063
Me father's name
is Bob Cratchit.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.565
We're very poor.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.933
And winning this competition

07:12.966 --> 07:15.669
would be a Christmas miracle.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.971
That's from A Christmas Carol.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.139
It's based on my life.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.541
You were born in 1843?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.610
- Obviously.
- Well, in that case,

07:22.643 --> 07:25.245
it's time for your third
and final chance, Tiny Robin.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.480
Woo-hoo!

07:29.817 --> 07:31.151
Hello, everyone.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.254
I'd like to introduce you
to, Tiny Robin.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.123
So, Tiny Robin,

07:36.156 --> 07:39.159
do you really think I have what
it takes to win this competition?

07:39.192 --> 07:40.594
Well, if they don't like you

07:40.628 --> 07:42.663
then they are a bigger dummy
than me.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.000
Sorry, he didn't mean that.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.569
Oh, yes, I did.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.402
Oi, Superman.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.940
Do you consider yourself
a good judge?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.509
Because you certainly aren't
a good judge of fashion.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.846
I mean, this guy wears his underwear
on the outside of his pants.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.216
Oh, uh...

08:03.250 --> 08:04.552
He didn't mean that.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.053
Oh, yes, I did.
Oi, Batman.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.990
I heard you were overdue
on your electric bill.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.193
Looks like you're gonna have
a Dark Knight.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.263
I'm on a roll.
Somebody stop me.

08:16.296 --> 08:19.733
Do you ever wonder, why they
call her Wonder Woman?

08:19.767 --> 08:21.602
Because she's always wondering

08:21.635 --> 08:23.637
where she left her
invisible jet.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.940
And Aquaman.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.910
This guy talks to fishes
and swims really fast.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.880
"That will come in handy,"
said nobody ever.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.590
I did it.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.025
I did it. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I made it.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.727
I'd just like to say thank you
to the judges.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.796
They have really, really,
really, great judgment.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.898
You mean better than last time
when you said...

08:50.931 --> 08:53.033
These judges can't see talent.
I've got talent

08:53.066 --> 08:56.637
and good looks. I'm the
whole package. Look at me.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.606
- Yes, much better.
- Oh, snap.

08:58.639 --> 09:03.977
When we return, we're going to
the final round. Right now.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.780
After all
the auditions and mad drama,

09:06.814 --> 09:09.583
it all came down
to three contestants.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.719
Four contestants.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.853
Who's it gonna be?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.588
Cyborg, the singing machine

09:14.622 --> 09:16.724
Raven, the dancing diva.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.626
Or Tiny Robin and his dummy.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.696
We'll find out when we
come back, right now.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.133
The winner

09:26.166 --> 09:29.603
and the newest member of the
Justice League is...

09:29.637 --> 09:31.571
Please, oh, please, oh,
please, oh, please, oh, please!

09:42.683 --> 09:43.751
Robin!

09:43.784 --> 09:46.720
Oh, my goodness, I won.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.288
Those judges don't know talent.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.224
In your faces. Ha! Ha! Ha!

09:51.258 --> 09:53.727
Wow, I want to feel happy
for him

09:53.761 --> 09:55.228
but he makes it so hard.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.630
♪ I can't believe it ♪

09:56.664 --> 09:57.765
♪ I can't believe it ♪

09:57.798 --> 09:58.866
I am now a full

09:58.899 --> 10:01.735
fledged member of the Justice League.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.671
Hold up!
Checkity-check yourself.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.537
You got it twisted, dawg!

10:04.571 --> 10:07.174
- What?
- The judges chose this Robin.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.008
Not you, dumb-dumb.

10:08.041 --> 10:12.112
They chose my
ventriloquist dummy!

10:12.145 --> 10:14.114
That's riggity-right,
home slice.

10:14.147 --> 10:18.418
Dummy Robin is the newest member
of the Justice League, yo.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.921
No!

10:20.954 --> 10:23.757
And so, Dummy Robin
went on to great success.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.525
Beating villain, making friends,

10:25.558 --> 10:29.029
winning awards, and just been an
all around ridunkulous little dude.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.898
And that's the show
for you, homies.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.400
This is Birdarang,
signing out, right now!
