13:36.233 --> 13:39.646
- What was he gonna do?
- Is this what was in his pockets?

13:39.736 --> 13:43.604
- Yes.
- There ’s a l/gh ter,
but d/d you ﬁnd any CIgarettes?

13:43.740 --> 13:47.153
No.
Did you find anything else?

13:47.244 --> 13:50.486
On him, no.
We did find a bottle ofwater
he dropped while he was running.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.492
Hmm.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.791
Why would he try to hold on
to a bottle of water
while he was running?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.713
[Sniffs]

14:01.800 --> 14:03.336
[Chuckles]

14:03.427 --> 14:06.794
Petrol.
Gasoline?

14:06.888 --> 14:09.925
He was here to make
a political protest.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.300
Could’ve been planning
to immolate himself.
Set himselfon fire?

14:13.395 --> 14:15.351
That would explain the lighter,
no cigarettes—

14:15.439 --> 14:18.397
Well, if he was here
to attack the ambassador,
why kill himself?

14:18.483 --> 14:22.226
There have been almost
a thousand self-Immo/ations
in Asia over the past 40 years.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.063
They’re most common in Vietnam,
India and South Korea.

14:26.158 --> 14:29.275
The guy that actually fired the shots?
You haven’t got him. He’s still here.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.451
Oh, that’s great.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.998
Okay, we keep the building sealed.
I want all the guests moved
into holding rooms.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.791
Tell D.C. Police we’re keepingjurisdiction.
We need to talk.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.870
[Man]
Yes, sir. let’s go.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.001
The shooter is in the building,
and we don’t know
whether he’s armed or not.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.424
But I’ve got 250 wedding guests
as suspects.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.753
Actually, that’s not true.
Men commit 90% of gun homicides.

14:49.848 --> 14:53.340
Most ofthem are between 17 and 49.
Odds are you got a male under 50.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.302
This narrows it down to what?
750 people?

14:56.396 --> 15:00.059
Whatever it is, I need your help.
I’ve got 12 agents.
With all the V.I.P.’s here,

15:00.150 --> 15:03.608
it’s gonna be hard to keep
this building shut down
for more than an hour or two.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.902
Do you still think
that somebody was trying
to kill the ambassador?

15:05.989 --> 15:09.527
Ifthis is somebody slick
enough to smuggle a gun in here,
assume he hit his target.

15:09.618 --> 15:13.657
- This is somebody who
wanted to kill the groom.
- Getting in here took planning.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.284
Ifthe motive is personal,
it’s probably a long-standing grievance—

15:16.374 --> 15:19.036
lots of suppressed anger.

15:19.127 --> 15:22.585
The person you’re looking for
had to hide his feelings
till the groom arrived.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.663
Some ofthat emotion
must’ve leaked out.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.919
Get the tape from
the videographers and, uh,

15:27.010 --> 15:30.753
isolate any, uh, suppressed anger,
fear, contempt.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.384
- Did the family mention
a threat to the groom?
- Not a word.

15:33.475 --> 15:36.638
Uh, somebody’s ly/ng.
Talk to people
who knew the groom.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.344
Look for signs of concealment,
somebody who seems to be
holding something back.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.971
Right.
[A ronson ]
You gonna talk to the parents?

15:41.066 --> 15:43.648
Ifyou’re looking for liars,
you start at the top.

15:43.735 --> 15:47.603
Hey. Aronson told me
to give you any help
that you need.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.188
I’m Karl. Karl Dupree.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.235
Aronson sent you?
That’s right.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.696
No, it isn’t.
You asked him ifyou
could work with me, right?

15:58.875 --> 16:01.252
Not much gets past you,
does it?
[Chuckles]

16:01.336 --> 16:03.327
You have no idea.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.539
Let’s go.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.880
[Siren Whooping]

16:11.096 --> 16:14.338
[ Woman On PA., Ind/stinct]
M rs. Pa rk?

16:14.432 --> 16:18.391
Hi I’m Gillian Foster.
This is Cal t/ghtman.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.978
How do you do?

16:22.065 --> 16:24.852
We’re working with
the Secret Service to try
and figure out what happened.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.934
How’s— How’s Wan Hee doing?

16:27.028 --> 16:31.442
We don’t know.
Hejust got out ofsurgery.
They’re moving him to the ICU.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.024
We thought someone was gonna
try to hurt the ambassador.

16:34.119 --> 16:37.532
But it looks l/ke
whoevershotyourhusband
was ﬂying to hurt him.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.739
Do you know why somebody
would want to do that?

16:40.834 --> 16:44.122
I don’t understand. I thought this was
a political issue about his father.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.296
It doesn’t look like that anymore.
Did he ever mention anyone threatening him?

16:48.383 --> 16:52.877
Threatening him? Uh, no.

16:52.971 --> 16:56.964
- No. Are you sure about this?
- What were you just thinking?

16:57.058 --> 16:59.049
Excuse me?

16:59.144 --> 17:01.931
Something just went through your mind.
What was it?

17:02.022 --> 17:04.263
I don’t know.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.724
Ma’am, I can take you
to your husband now.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.855
I have to go.

17:14.409 --> 17:19.278
Additional cognitive process in the eye ﬂutter.
There’s something she’s not telling us.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.988
Or she’s freaked out
because shejust heard
her husband was targeted...

17:22.083 --> 17:24.460
for assassination
on their wedding day.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.035
Could be.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.121
[Man ]
We ’re professional wdeographers.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.049
So ifyou ’re not part of the families,
we can ’t give you the tapes.

17:32.135 --> 17:36.629
We’re trying to figure out
who shot the groom, which I’m
pretty sure the families support.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.884
Sorry. We have—
[Chuckles]

17:38.975 --> 17:43.765
There’s a contract
that strictly forbids,
uh, releasing the footage.

17:43.855 --> 17:48.645
- Nothin’ I can do.
- Yeah, see, those hesitations and repetitions—

17:48.735 --> 17:52.853
You’re having trouble
processing what you’re saying,
which typically means you’re lying.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.030
/ 7/ bet your contract
doesn ’t say anything

17:55.158 --> 17:59.447
You want to take a look at the footage,
because you want to see
ifthe shooting is on there.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.788
Because ifit is, you’re gonna sell it to
the tabloid that writes the fattest check.
Right?

18:03.875 --> 18:06.036
You’re t/yin’ to get
the guy who d/d this?

18:06.127 --> 18:10.211
- That’s right.
- Don’t be an idiot, man.
Give him the tapes.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.209
Let’s go.

18:14.886 --> 18:18.504
Ifany ofthis footage
shows up on the net,

18:18.598 --> 18:21.305
I’m gonna rip your head off
and stuff it down your throat.

18:21.393 --> 18:24.009
No hesitation.
Now you’re telling the truth.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.020
Thanks. Thank you.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.224
Who would want
to kill my son?

18:30.360 --> 18:33.852
We’re trying
to find that out.
You are mistaken.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.064
Ifthere was a second
assassin in the room, well,
then two were sent after me.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.113
This had nothing
to do with my family.
Are you sure about that?

18:41.204 --> 18:44.241
Politics was behind this—

18:44.332 --> 18:46.994
people who want to silence me.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.417
That is who you
should be looking for.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.664
A finger tells you so much,
doesn’t it?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.214
Yeah. It pointed one way while
his eyes were pointed another.
That happens when you’re lying.

18:58.305 --> 19:02.844
Your mind’s working so hard
to make stuff up that your body
can’t keep in sync.

19:02.934 --> 19:07.724
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.430
[Eli]
These tapes are from
the videographers at the wedding.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.767
Most of the footage is from
the hour before the shootings,

19:13.862 --> 19:16.148
so you’re not likely to see
any overt anger or fear.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.195
We’re looking for someone
trying to hide those feelings.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.901
Since it’s a wedding and pretty
much everyone is pretending
they’re having a good time,

19:21.995 --> 19:26.079
you’re gonna see a lot of people
hiding theirfeelings,
and that means masking smiles.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.866
We’re looking for these.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.417
- Fear smile,
- [Punching Keys]

19:31.504 --> 19:34.712
anger... and contempt

19:34.799 --> 19:38.291
Find anyone displaying
one of these, ﬂag it
and bring it to me right away.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.547
We have exactly
no time to do this.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.844
[Chattering]

19:46.853 --> 19:48.935
Uh, we need to know
ifthe groom mentioned—

19:49.022 --> 19:52.230
We need to know ifthe groom mentioned anyone
threatening him or speaking to h/m angrily.

19:52.317 --> 19:55.024
Heard anything about the bride or the groom?
Anybody threatening anyone?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.727
Anything causing him any trouble?
Even something minor.

19:57.822 --> 20:02.691
Can ’t think of an ythmg.
He was happy
He was crazy in love with Phoebe.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.027
That’s all he talked about.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.282
He say anything different to you?

20:07.374 --> 20:10.241
No.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.326
Didn’t mention anything.

20:12.420 --> 20:16.004
You’re the best man, right?
What’s your name?

20:16.091 --> 20:19.083
Garrett. Garrett Craywood.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.042
[Door Opens]
[Phone Beeping ]

20:21.179 --> 20:24.216
Who are you calling?
C.I.A., see what they
got on the ambassador.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.218
You know that’s
gonna be classified.
Who’s your contact?

20:26.351 --> 20:27.807
Laura.
Laura who?

20:27.936 --> 20:29.892
Laura ofthe C.I.A.
[Alec]
Hey.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.971
Hey! What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving
right after the ceremony.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.941
I didn’t get out in time.
Oh, I’m sorry.
But I have to—

20:36.027 --> 20:38.860
I have to make
this meeting in Reston.
I told Toliver I’d cover it.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.313
It’s important
I don’t let him down.
Just walk me out, okay?

20:41.449 --> 20:45.488
What-What do you mean?
Tell the Secret Service guy
I can go.

20:45.620 --> 20:50.239
I can’t do that.
Sure you can.
You’re in charge, right?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.575
- Gill, it’s important.
- One person gets walked out,
and eve/ybody’s gonna t/y.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.912
We ’re not gonna be able
to keep the place sea/ed

20:57.006 --> 21:00.794
Never mind
I’ll call the office.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.627
Uh, come find me
when you’re done.
Okay.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.846
[Sighs]

21:09.644 --> 21:13.307
What did Laura ofthe C.I.A.
have to say?
She’ll get back to me.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.480
Hey. You wanted somebody
concealing something?

21:15.567 --> 21:18.058
The best man lied
when I asked about the groom.

21:19.863 --> 21:25.699
Uh, first, I wanted to say
that Wan Hee and I met our
freshman year at Columbia.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.776
This is from
the rehearsal dinner last night.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.408
[ Craywood]
He was into Mozart and poetry,

21:30.498 --> 21:32.784
and he liked to volunteer
at the homeless shelter.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.867
/, on the otherhand
was into—

21:34.961 --> 21:38.704
You talked to Craywood earlier.
Notice anything different
from the way he sounded then?

21:38.840 --> 21:41.547
[Ria]
Um—
[Laughing]

21:41.634 --> 21:43.795
/ think his voice
is higher pitched here.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.878
He’s definitely talking faster.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.963
That means his emotions
are heightened...

21:48.057 --> 21:50.434
or maybe he’s trying
to control his anger.

21:50.518 --> 21:53.351
He’s, uh— He’s the most
generous guy I know.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.641
Oh, stop it there.
[ Clicks, Stops]

21:56.900 --> 21:58.891
Move in on his right hand.

22:01.738 --> 22:06.698
- [ Beeping]
- Here’s a question you don’t
usually hear at a wedding.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.571
Why is the best man
giving the groom the finger?

22:09.662 --> 22:13.154
- Are you sure that’s what he’s doing?
- Who are you?

22:13.249 --> 22:16.787
Oh, sorry. This is Karl Dupree
from Secret Service. He’s working with me.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.995
/ ’m just saying,
the guy’s scratching his eye.
Maybe his eye itches.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.047
No, no.
That’s a gestural emblem.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.501
It’s an unconscious gesture
with a specific meaning.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.804
Uh, Loker, pull up
the politician videos
with the same gestural emblem.

22:29.891 --> 22:34.009
Now, Senator McCain has served
this country honorably.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.310
He has—

22:38.733 --> 22:42.772
[Man]
What letter grade would you give yourself
as Secretary of Defense?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.239
Oh, I’d let history
worry about that.

22:45.323 --> 22:47.985
That’s hostility.

22:48.076 --> 22:49.987
[Beeping]

22:50.078 --> 22:52.615
Now, / know why
those two felt that way

22:52.705 --> 22:55.037
The question is,

22:55.124 --> 22:57.331
why does the best man?

23:02.882 --> 23:05.373
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.
- Yeah, you do.

23:05.468 --> 23:08.460
I didn’t have a fight with Wan Hee.
I don’t know why you’re saying I did.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.342
Because I’ve seen you.
You’ve shown us
three different ways already.

23:17.855 --> 23:21.939
I get it.
You were mad at Wan Hee,
and he got hurt.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.564
And now you feel guilty.
You wonder if in some way
you’re to blame.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.691
But you know that’s not true.

23:29.617 --> 23:34.327
And the best way to help him now is to help us
find the person who did hurt him.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.249
He owes me
5,000 dollars.

23:40.378 --> 23:43.165
That doesn’t explain what you’re feeling.
it’s not about the money

23:47.844 --> 23:49.880
He has a gambling problem.

23:49.971 --> 23:52.087
Not many people know.
He keeps it quiet.

23:52.181 --> 23:56.140
He’s terrified his mother’s
family’s gonna find out.

23:56.227 --> 23:59.264
They’re old-school Korean.
They’d cut him offif
they knew what he was doing.

23:59.355 --> 24:03.223
A few weeks ago, he asked me to loan him
the five to get a bookie off his back.

24:03.318 --> 24:08.028
I gave it to him. Then I found out he didn’t pay
the debt. He put the money on another game.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.275
That’s when I got mad.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.276
I— I don’t know how much
he owes altogether now.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.828
But... someone talked
about hurting him.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.906
I know that.

24:22.754 --> 24:25.541
There you go.
Feel better now?

24:29.636 --> 24:33.379
All right.
We ran the groom’s banking records.
Backs up what the kid told you—

24:33.473 --> 24:35.964
busted credit,
large cash deposits
at erratic intervals.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.137
Sounds like gambling addiction.
We need to talk
to the ambassador.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.514
Go ahead.
He’s up in the residence.
Hejust got there.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.767
I gotta put down the riot
that’s brewing here.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.518
We don’t have much time left.
Hey, you want me to keep
talking to people or what?

24:47.612 --> 24:50.570
No. Go help Loker
with the tapes.

24:50.657 --> 24:54.115
- [Dupree]
/need you to stay in holding
- Don’t give me that.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.950
I want to leave now.
Sir, there is nothing
that I can do for you.

24:57.038 --> 25:00.701
I am Special Counsel
at the White House.
I could have yourjob.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.666
Now, are you going
to let me out of here or not?
Sir—

25:03.753 --> 25:07.245
Excuse me. Hi.
Uh, we’re gonna need
to check that out.

25:07.382 --> 25:10.294
What’s your number
at the office?
What?

25:10.385 --> 25:12.671
Or we couldjust
talk to your secretary.
What’s her name?

25:12.762 --> 25:17.005
- Well, I... don’t—
- Yeah. See, that’s the problem
with telling a lie.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.888
There are so many
other lies you have
to come up with.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.936
Go wait in
the room please.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.814
I didn’t need your help.
No. Absolutely not.

25:35.618 --> 25:39.736
When we asked you about threats,
why didn’t you tell us about
your husband’s gambling?

25:39.872 --> 25:42.204
Is that what you
were trying to hide?
No.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.124
The— The family treats
it like it’s a big secret,

25:45.211 --> 25:47.793
but it hasn’t been a problem lately.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.462
Wan Hee hasn’t placed a bet
in six months.

25:51.968 --> 25:54.960
Did he?

25:55.054 --> 25:58.546
Is that what this was about?
Somebody shot him over a bet?

25:58.683 --> 26:01.345
We don’t know.
You’re making a mistake.

26:03.438 --> 26:07.351
- He has no debts. I paid them.
- You what?

26:07.442 --> 26:11.401
I wanted him to start his
married life unencumbered.
I paid everything off.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.524
A wedding gift.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.526
When did he start
gambling again?

26:16.617 --> 26:19.029
My son is
in no way respons/b/e
for what happened

26:19.120 --> 26:21.953
Why didn’t anybody tell me
what was going on?

26:22.039 --> 26:25.657
Please leave my son out ofthis.
He’s done nothing wrong.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.617
You’re right.
What was I thinking?

26:27.712 --> 26:30.704
Your son has got nothing
to do with this. Really.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.834
He ’5 a— He ’5 a great son.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.884
He’s... spectacular.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.972
Really the best son I’ve seen...

26:42.268 --> 26:43.849
e VE’l’.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.812
[ G/l/ian ]
Why so much love
for the ambassador’s son?

26:51.903 --> 26:56.237
Did you catch the bodyguard’s
expression when the groom’s
name came up? His contempt?

26:56.324 --> 27:00.533
He really doesn’t
like the groom.
The question is, why?

27:03.581 --> 27:06.948
- His bow.
- Yeah, at the reception, you said

27:07.043 --> 27:10.627
When the wedding party came in,
the bodyguard gave the groom
a shallow bow.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.625
It’s a sign ofdisrespect.

27:13.716 --> 27:17.334
In Korea, the depth ofthe bow
is the measure ofa relationship
between two people.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.886
So the bodyguard should’ve
bowed to his toes, right?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.929
Why would he bow
to the groom like an equal?

27:23.017 --> 27:27.135
Get the ambassador
and the bodyguard.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.933
I’ll meet you there
in a minute.
Where are you going?

27:30.066 --> 27:32.603
[Pats Thigh]
Gotta see Aronson.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.070
I’m trying, yes.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.566
Look, I’ll call you as soon
as I get out of here.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.023
Hey.
You too.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.946
Hey.
Any idea how much longer
we’re gonna be here?

27:43.079 --> 27:45.445
I’m starting to feel
like a hostage.
Hard to say really.

27:45.581 --> 27:49.165
I’ve got to find a man
with a gun,you know.
I need to get out of here.

27:49.293 --> 27:53.377
Seriously.
Can you help me?
No. Sorry, it’s impossible.

27:53.464 --> 27:57.673
We both know that’s not true.
You can get anybody out
you want to.

27:57.760 --> 28:02.220
Cal, myjob’s on the line.
The deputy directorjust chewed my ear off...

28:02.348 --> 28:06.682
because I didn’t
make a meeting I was supposed to be in.
We both know that’s not true.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.927
Don’t we? Eh?
What are you implying?

28:09.021 --> 28:11.137
Well, it wasn’t a work call,
was it?

28:15.111 --> 28:18.194
- [ Chattering, Shouting]
- [Dupree]
Sit down.,

28:18.281 --> 28:21.773
We can ’t al/o w anyone
to leave at this t/me.l

28:23.828 --> 28:28.447
- Everybody! Get back! Sit down!
- [Crowd Quiets]

28:28.541 --> 28:31.032
We’ll get you out of here
as soon as we can.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.454
How are we doing?
It’s getting
out of control.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.753
Where’s Aronson?
I need to talk to him right away.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.126
He’s dealing with the crowd
on the second ﬂoor.

28:38.217 --> 28:43.007
- And you are?
- Dupree. We met a half hour ago.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.429
Fantastic.
Could you find Aronson for me?

28:45.516 --> 28:48.758
- For what?
- Need a favor.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.522
What are we waiting for?
Sir, I am so sorry.
He should be here any moment.

28:58.613 --> 29:00.979
You tell Dr. Lightman
that my son has been shot,

29:01.115 --> 29:03.572
and he is being loaded
into a—
Sony about that

29:03.659 --> 29:05.775
- Took a little longer than I thought.
- What did?

29:05.870 --> 29:07.701
Getting this.

29:15.212 --> 29:18.955
Sorry, everyone.
It’s only blanks.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.128
Courtesy of the Secret Service.
I will be in contact
with the Treasury...

29:22.261 --> 29:25.719
and the State Department
and my own government!
That’s nice.

29:29.310 --> 29:31.221
Excuse me?
They shut down.

29:31.312 --> 29:34.429
Their eyes close.
Their lips stretch.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.935
Everything just shuts down.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.392
But ifyou watch closely,
you can see the first thing...

29:39.487 --> 29:41.773
that goes through their mind
when the senses return.

29:41.864 --> 29:44.105
Why are you telling me this?

29:44.200 --> 29:47.488
Because after I fired the gun,

29:47.578 --> 29:51.241
you moved in front ofhim.

29:59.006 --> 30:02.840
Why would an official
protect his bodyguard?

30:02.927 --> 30:07.717
And why would that bodyguard
treat his son as an equal?

30:09.433 --> 30:12.470
Are they brothers?
[Scoffs]
Ridiculous.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.974
Mistakes happen.
Is he your son?

30:16.065 --> 30:19.353
You lie and I’ll know it.

30:19.443 --> 30:23.686
You were hired to protect
my family, not look into
our private life.

30:23.781 --> 30:26.443
- So he is your son.
- / d/dn ’t say that

30:26.534 --> 30:29.025
- Yeah, you did.
- This is none ofyour business.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.031
Just admit it for once!

30:31.122 --> 30:34.114
What does any of this
have to do with
what happened today?

30:34.250 --> 30:37.663
You tell me. You seem to think he’s involved.
Why would you say that?

30:37.753 --> 30:43.589
Before the shooting, eve/y time
you talked about your bodyguard
you showed embarrassment

30:43.676 --> 30:48.170
And since the shooting,
every time you’ve been with him,
you’ve shown anger.

30:48.264 --> 30:51.927
You’re showing it now, right?
Why is that?
Why are you so angiy?

30:52.018 --> 30:54.384
You think he’d try
to kill his brother?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.936
Eh?

31:02.403 --> 31:06.316
Tell him he’s wrong.
Tell him he’s wrong.

31:08.409 --> 31:10.821
You have always hated Wan Hee.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.820
Treated him with disrespect.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.870
’Cause you won’t
tell anyone who I am.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.913
Did you shoot him?
How can you ask me that?

31:20.004 --> 31:23.872
You had a gun.
You were standing near him.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.957
[Whispers]
Did you shoot him?

31:28.637 --> 31:32.129
No. I didn’t.

31:33.809 --> 31:36.186
You know, if you’re interested,

31:36.270 --> 31:38.386
I see no sign that he’s lying.

31:38.481 --> 31:41.473
It doesn’t matter
howl feel.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.183
I do myjob. I protect you.

31:44.278 --> 31:47.145
I protect Wan Hee.
I protect Phoebe.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.275
Oh, that’s good!

31:49.366 --> 31:51.448
That’s interesting.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.444
Why are you disgusted?
What?

31:54.538 --> 31:56.654
Why does mentioning Phoebe
make you feel that way?

31:57.958 --> 32:00.870
It’s nothing.
Oh, no.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.953
Nothing is nothing.

32:04.048 --> 32:06.039
What was that, eh?

32:08.094 --> 32:11.382
- People think Phoebe’s so nice.
- You don’t?

32:11.472 --> 32:16.842
A few weeks ago,
she said she had to meet some man.
Asked if! would go along.

32:16.936 --> 32:21.020
She wouldn’t say why.
Just wanted me there.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.473
Then she changed her mind.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.558
Said she’d go alone.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.733
But she made me swear
not to tell anyone.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.571
You tell me
what that means.

32:37.540 --> 32:41.783
[Giggles]
So anyway, what I really
wanted to say is that...

32:41.919 --> 32:44.501
I’ve been working
on my Korean.
Oh.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.796
[ laughter]
Sony, Wan Hee,

32:47.883 --> 32:51.967
but, um, ljust want to tiy out
a couple of words here today

32:52.054 --> 32:54.340
[Korean]

32:54.473 --> 32:57.306
Which means,
“/ lo ve you with all my heait. ”
What are you looking for?

32:57.393 --> 33:00.635
Somebody was
in contact with the bride—
somebody she didn’t tell us about.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.221
Dupree, could you
bring her down here?
I need to talk to her.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.227
Sure.

33:07.361 --> 33:10.649
I don’t see anything,
do you?
Nope

33:10.739 --> 33:14.402
- Do you have
any other footage, Loker?
- Uh, the wedding.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.993
Here it is.
[ Wan Hee]
richer or for poorer—

33:18.122 --> 33:21.330
in sickness and in health—
in sickness and in health—

33:21.458 --> 33:23.995
to love and to cherish—
to love and to cherish—

33:24.086 --> 33:28.329
- for all the days ofour lives.
- for all the days of our lives.

33:28.465 --> 33:32.333
I, Phoebe Hedalin—
I, Phoebe Hedalin—

33:32.428 --> 33:35.511
- take you, Wan Hee Park—
- Oh. Oh. Can you play that back again?

33:35.598 --> 33:38.965
- Roll that back again,
but slowly this time.
- [Clicking]

33:39.101 --> 33:42.593
I, Phoebe Hedalin—
I, Phoebe Hedalin—

33:42.688 --> 33:44.599
ta ke you—

33:44.690 --> 33:48.478
- You see the shoulder shrug?
- She’s lying about her name?

33:48.569 --> 33:51.026
- It seems that way.
- Why would she do that?

33:51.155 --> 33:53.692
I don’t know.
Do you think this
has anything to do...

33:53.782 --> 33:55.738
with the man
she was gonna go meet?

33:55.826 --> 33:58.863
- I don’t know.
- We talked to a lot of people.
It seems like nobody here...

33:58.954 --> 34:01.115
has known Phoebe more
than three or four years.

34:01.207 --> 34:04.825
- What about her parents?
- Dead. Bridesmaids, friends—
They’re all from work.

34:04.919 --> 34:08.787
There is nobody here
from where she grew up—
no family or old friends at all.

34:08.881 --> 34:12.373
- Where is she from?
- Uh, maid of honor said Michigan.

34:14.261 --> 34:17.879
What if... she left
a life back there?

34:17.973 --> 34:20.225
Uh, different name
and everything
and never told anyone?

34:20.309 --> 34:22.265
At the hospital— the eye flutter.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.469
Did he ever mention
anyone threatening him?

34:24.563 --> 34:28.556
Threatening him? Uh, no.

34:28.651 --> 34:32.360
We thought she was
trying to cover up a threat
someone made to her husband.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.607
What if it was a threat
someone made to her?

34:34.698 --> 34:36.780
Yeah, the guy
she went to meet.

34:36.867 --> 34:39.859
Why would an old boyfriend
shoot the groom?
/sn ’t he mad at her?

34:39.954 --> 34:44.038
No, no. He’s in love with her.
But the groom is in the way.

34:44.124 --> 34:47.662
Lightman,
we gotta open the doors
and let everybody go.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.961
- We need more time.
- Ijust got off the phone with
the Secretary ofthe Treasury.

34:51.048 --> 34:53.790
He’s furious. So we’re gonna
release all the guests
and turn the investigation...

34:53.926 --> 34:56.258
over to D. C Police.
[ Dupree ]
We got another problem. Phoebe ’s gone.

34:56.345 --> 35:00.133
She told the agent at the door
she was going back to the hospital,
but she’s not there.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.552
Nobody knows where she is.
I gotta open the doors.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.975
Just give me 15 minutes.
All right?

35:06.188 --> 35:07.689
No.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.480
Nope. Nope.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.558
Nope. No.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.894
No.

35:14.989 --> 35:17.822
All right, that’s it for that batch.
Put the next lot up.

35:17.908 --> 35:20.445
That’s all I’ve got.
Every microexpression
and emblem we could find...

35:20.536 --> 35:25.621
that displays anger, contempt,
hostility, latent violence
or anything like ’em.

35:25.708 --> 35:29.326
We’ve had the Secret Service
and the wedding planner go over
the guest list with the video.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.787
As far as we can tell,
we have seen every guest.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.543
Ifsomeone was concealing
homicidal intent,
he wasn’t on camera.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.751
Oh, Loker’s right.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.837
So then where was he?

35:41.932 --> 35:45.595
Tell Aronson to let the guests go.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.847
I know who we need to talk to.

35:56.739 --> 35:59.697
Well, thanks for letting us
look through your stuff
it was great

35:59.783 --> 36:01.990
You’re very thorough.

36:02.077 --> 36:07.322
In fact, the only person
we didn’t see
on the footage was you—

36:07.416 --> 36:09.372
the cameramen—
which makes sense.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.951
I mean,
cameraman’s not supposed
to be on camera, right?

36:12.046 --> 36:16.665
Now, / talked earlier...
about an expression that’s displayed.

36:16.759 --> 36:19.341
when you’re about to commit
an act ofviolence.

36:19.428 --> 36:23.842
There’s also an expression
that’s triggered by the motive
behind that violence.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.014
For example,
when you went to see your ex-wife...

36:26.101 --> 36:30.310
and she told you she was gonna
get remarried to some rich guy,

36:30.397 --> 36:33.605
and she didn’t care
how you felt.

36:33.692 --> 36:38.311
Because... as far as she was concerned,
you were nothing.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.274
You’ve been replaced.

36:46.246 --> 36:51.536
Now, when you think back
to that moment...

36:51.627 --> 36:55.961
and the anger... that you felt—

37:00.219 --> 37:02.551
Your face.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.754
It shows in your face.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.180
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [ Chattering]

37:07.267 --> 37:09.474
[ Grunting]

37:09.561 --> 37:10.596
Sit down.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.566
We were married.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.947
That’s supposed to be for life.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.415
Isn’t that what getting married means?

37:30.499 --> 37:32.490
For better or worse?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.291
Richer or poorer?

37:35.379 --> 37:37.370
Sickness and health?

37:39.258 --> 37:41.169
Right?

37:45.347 --> 37:48.589
He’s former military.
He and Phoebe were married
four years ago.

37:48.684 --> 37:54.020
Her name was Carla DeMaeo then.
They divorced. She changed
her name, moved to DC.

37:54.148 --> 37:57.311
He tracked her down
a couple months ago.
How did he get through security?

37:57.401 --> 38:00.108
He probably spent months
planning this.
He was obsessed.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.937
He remachined his pistol
to break apart
into smaller pieces.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.158
It looked like
camera equipment
inside his bag.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.949
- That’s romantic.
- [ Dupree]
Agent Aronson?

38:08.036 --> 38:10.243
Excuse me.

38:10.372 --> 38:13.785
Dr. Lightman. Dr. Foster.
[Aronson ]
What do we got? A// right

38:13.876 --> 38:17.039
[Korean]
Thank you so much.

38:17.129 --> 38:20.087
[ C hattering ]

38:24.511 --> 38:28.754
I saw them take Howard away.
Did he hurt somebody else?

38:28.849 --> 38:30.714
No.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.425
I had no idea he was here
during the wedding.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.262
/ would ha ve said
something if/ had

38:36.356 --> 38:40.019
/ never meant
to lie to anybody

38:40.110 --> 38:43.853
It didn’t even feel like lying really.
It’sjust—

38:43.947 --> 38:46.654
I was so unhappy
when I left Michigan.

38:46.742 --> 38:51.076
And changing my name
and pretending like
none of it happened it was...

38:52.456 --> 38:54.447
just such a relief.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.327
Tell Wan Hee—

39:05.761 --> 39:07.752
Wan Hee is awake.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.839
He’s asking for you.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.092
We should go see him.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.394
Okay.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.309
Hey.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.685
Full day, huh?

40:02.776 --> 40:05.313
Want to get a drink? Celebrate?

40:07.114 --> 40:09.025
[Sighs]

40:09.116 --> 40:11.903
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

40:11.994 --> 40:16.158
- Didn’t we get past the tough talk?
- Yeah, we did.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.364
Still don’t think it’s a good idea.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.918
You know, we were briefed on your team
before you guys came in,

40:23.005 --> 40:28.341
and, uh, I know what you can do,
and it doesn’t scare me.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.418
I got nothing to hide.

40:30.512 --> 40:34.346
So come on.
It’sjust a drink.

40:35.517 --> 40:39.226
The problem is... I like you.

40:39.354 --> 40:43.313
And that’s a problem because—
Because it’ll be more than just a drink.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.062
And then it’ll
get complicated.

40:47.738 --> 40:51.322
I’ll know every lie you tell,
which means I’ll know everything about you.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.572
You sure you’re up for that?

40:55.662 --> 40:58.278
I’m in.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.240
Okay then.

41:01.335 --> 41:03.576
[Gillian]
Uh, yeah. Yeah, maybe 20 minutes.

41:03.670 --> 41:07.333
Yeah, I made a reservation.
Okay. See you there.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.590
Hi.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.588
Date night?
Sort of.

41:12.721 --> 41:16.464
More ofan apology date really.
What are you apologizing for?

41:16.558 --> 41:20.016
He asked for my help
getting out ofthe embassy,
and I turned him down.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.890
You’re not supposed to do that
when you’re married, remember?

41:23.023 --> 41:25.435
You did the right thing.
Hmm!

41:25.525 --> 41:27.777
Ah, you’re not my husband.

41:27.861 --> 41:31.149
Alec’s trying to move up at State,
which means doing
favors for your bosses...

41:31.239 --> 41:33.651
and getting to the right meetings,
which I could’ve helped him with.

41:33.742 --> 41:36.484
But I had to follow the rules
and be the good girl.

41:36.578 --> 41:41.993
So, I’m gonna...
pour him a glass ofwine
and say I’m sorry.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.912
Marriage.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.994
Okay,
I’ll see you tomorrow.

41:48.799 --> 41:52.166
- Hey, Foster.
- What?

41:52.260 --> 41:55.047
I don’t think you’re the good girl.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.389
Liar.
