01:15.800 --> 01:18.001
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Dad.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.129
Are you coming home soon?

01:20.360 --> 01:23.603
Yeah, uh, in an hour or so.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.645
What's up? Where's Mom?

01:27.240 --> 01:29.686
I don't think she's feeling good.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.525
I know.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.371
Don't worry. I'm working on
getting her better, okay?

01:37.440 --> 01:39.169
It's just...

01:40.400 --> 01:42.084
She's been talking to herself.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.851
Listen.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.044
I will be home with you very soon,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.441
and I am gonna get Mom better. I promise.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.526
Okay.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.081
- I'll see you soon, buddy.
- See you soon.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.247
You want anyone on overtime?

02:16.480 --> 02:18.323
No. I got to, uh...

02:18.840 --> 02:20.251
I gotta...

02:21.000 --> 02:22.604
Just go ahead and close up.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.486
Okay.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.167
Very least, maybe you could get her to
stop locking herself in the closet, okay?

03:35.800 --> 03:39.282
Right. So, we don't call it
an intervention, we call it a...

03:39.600 --> 03:40.806
Paul?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.166
I saw something.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.641
This thing is really starting
to take its toll on him.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.723
- Paul!
- One second, please.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.321
What?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.528
There was something in the back room.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.440
What do you mean, "Something?"

03:53.600 --> 03:54.601
Uh, I don't know.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.161
It disappeared.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.481
Esther, I really gotta
deal with this, so...

04:00.880 --> 04:02.325
Just go home, okay?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.050
Be careful on your way out, okay?

04:05.240 --> 04:08.130
Okay, so I'll be home in about,
uh, an hour.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.401
Okay.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.922
Yeah. Bye.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.201
Esther?

05:18.680 --> 05:19.920
Okay.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.127
Oh, no, no, no.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.640
Come on!

07:27.800 --> 07:29.006
Hey.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.601
What are the chances we go again?

07:36.120 --> 07:39.090
- Um... Slim to none.
- Hmm.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.851
About that.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.560
- No?
- No.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.042
I'm gonna go take a shower.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.362
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll join you.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.087
You'll smell like girly soap.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.601
Hey.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.491
- Marathon man.
- I'm up.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.448
Don't think you're staying.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.971
Becca.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.529
- Just one night?
- Nope.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.768
You're gonna kick me out
in the middle of the night.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.122
You're gonna be okay. You're not a puppy.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.931
I thought I was your boyfriend.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.361
"Boyfriend?"

08:51.840 --> 08:54.446
Who said anything about "boyfriend"?

08:58.000 --> 09:02.210
Uh, you're a guy,
the only guy that I've been seeing.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.211
It's been eight months.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.646
Really? Eight months?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.644
- Eight months.
- Wow!

09:08.080 --> 09:10.811
That officially puts you in first place.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.324
How about I keep a pair of jeans here?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.646
Nope.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.247
Uh, a sock?
I mean, just one sock, of course.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.331
What are you gonna do with just one sock?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.045
Is that a yes?

09:24.200 --> 09:27.044
No! Get out of here. I have work tomorrow.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.484
Not like having a sock here
means you can't get rid of me.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.170
Socks are not anchors.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.448
Okay, I'm gonna see you
tomorrow night at that gig.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.210
Can we just agree to that, please?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.044
Yeah, all right.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.724
Are you still there?

09:51.920 --> 09:52.921
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.805
You know, one of these nights,
you could let me...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.211
Love you, too.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.210
Hey, sexy.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.011
I like you.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.361
A lot.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.201
Is that all?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.001
No.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.208
There is one more thing.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.085
So close.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.001
Mom?

12:01.480 --> 12:02.481
Mom?

12:04.560 --> 12:07.211
I just don't know what to do about it.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.410
I'm so sorry...

12:09.960 --> 12:11.644
I really don't.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.121
Mom?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.169
Hey, Martin, what's up?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.731
You okay?

12:19.480 --> 12:21.847
Yeah, I will be, just gonna take a bit.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.284
Did we wake you?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.962
- What?
- Hey.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.162
You gotta go back to bed, sweetie.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.882
The only ones that should be wandering
the halls at this hour are grownups.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.523
Good night, Martin.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.409
She isn't answering.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.770
Hey, Martin?

14:17.760 --> 14:20.604
Is there someone else we can call for you?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.726
It's just...

14:24.960 --> 14:26.121
I didn't know you had a brother.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.361
Yeah.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.770
Are you Rebecca?

14:31.040 --> 14:32.041
Uh, yeah.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.442
I'm Emma. I'm with Child Services.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.808
I was assigned to Martin
after your father died last...

14:37.080 --> 14:38.081
Stepfather.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.408
- Excuse me?
- He was my stepfather.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.406
My dad ran off when I was 10,
and did not come back.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.166
If we could just talk
about Martin for a minute?

14:46.440 --> 14:49.489
How is he when he's at home?
Is he sleeping?

14:50.440 --> 14:52.488
I wouldn't know. I don't live there.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.489
So, it's just
your mother in the house, then?

14:54.720 --> 14:55.801
Yeah.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.129
How is she holding up?

14:59.240 --> 15:02.642
Um, well, she's taking
her antidepressants,

15:02.880 --> 15:04.325
if that's what you're asking.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.688
Okay, and how bad is it?

15:06.960 --> 15:07.961
This depression?

15:08.160 --> 15:09.730
I'm sorry, is Martin okay?

15:09.920 --> 15:13.322
'Cause you're grilling me like
he has a black eye or something.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.767
He fell asleep in home room this morning.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.644
For the third time in the past week.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.605
Okay, excuse me.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.527
Hey.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.120
You showed up.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.200
Yeah.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.042
I didn't know if you would.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.966
Okay.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.529
Uh, where's Mom?

15:45.160 --> 15:49.085
Martin, I know you and your mother
are going through a lot.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.889
And it's harder for you
because you can't talk to Mom about it.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.211
Maybe you even tried to help her?

15:57.920 --> 16:01.925
If you ever wanna talk about it,
I'm here, okay?

16:02.760 --> 16:03.807
This is why you left.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.805
Isn't it?

16:07.680 --> 16:10.490
Uh, no, my deal
was a lot more complicated.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.647
Okay.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.882
Let's go. I'll get you home.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.131
Your home?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.850
Or Mom's?

16:21.160 --> 16:22.605
Where you live.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.929
Hey.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.209
You're gonna be okay.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.926
Come on.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.805
He'll be fine.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.360
Okay.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.087
- We'll be in touch.
- Uh-huh.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.601
Here we are.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.730
You should let me stay at your place.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.451
Just for a night.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.243
Good luck with that one, buddy.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.771
Um, you know what?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.888
I do not think you're
really gonna like it there.

17:10.040 --> 17:14.284
'Cause I have these weird,
kind of, scary posters on the wall.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.204
I just need sleep.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.651
We can talk about it. Yeah?

17:23.160 --> 17:24.320
Any tips for the moms?

17:24.720 --> 17:26.801
Uh, you are not coming in.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.080
Come on, why not?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.524
Because she's crazy.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.604
Mom goes through phases like this.
Just give her time.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.207
Has she been social with anyone?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.562
Someone keeps on coming over.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.886
Good. Who?

17:43.440 --> 17:44.601
Diana.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.406
What did you say?

17:50.040 --> 17:51.849
Her name is Diana.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.922
Hey, I know what you're going through,

17:59.200 --> 18:02.124
because Mom did the same thing to me
when my dad left.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.810
And I had really bad dreams about Diana.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.691
But that's all that they are, okay?

18:10.080 --> 18:12.048
Because she isn't real.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.931
Becca, hi.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.969
Hi, Mom.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.731
What are you doing home, little mister?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.650
She'll tell you.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.731
He hasn't been sleeping.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.249
Well, can you blame him?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.522
Paul was everything to us.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.365
Nearly everything.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.920
Have you been seeing a therapist, Mom?

18:44.600 --> 18:48.241
I am not gonna go to a stranger
to talk about my problems.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.164
I've gone through that before.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.965
You remember?

18:52.280 --> 18:53.770
Yeah, I do remember.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.005
How long have you been off your meds?

19:01.920 --> 19:03.331
Excuse me?

19:03.640 --> 19:04.721
Yeah.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.571
Do you think I wanted
any of this to happen to me?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.888
What about Martin?
Have you thought about him?

19:58.440 --> 20:01.444
Are you really gonna
play the bad mother card with me?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.802
You, of all people, huh?

20:04.240 --> 20:07.801
Do you know what it's like
to raise him without a father?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.122
Look how you turned out.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.046
I'm gonna give you a few days.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.486
And, until you stop
being completely manic,

20:27.800 --> 20:30.371
- I'm gonna have Martin staying with me.
- Mmm-mmm.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.682
- Yeah, it's what's gonna happen, Mom.
- Mmm-mmm.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.088
And you can call me
when you're feeling better.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.281
- Pack your bags.
- No, no, no.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.481
I'm ready.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.005
Martin, no, no, no.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.322
Martin, please, please, please.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.761
- You planned this, didn't you?
- Let's go.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.047
You planned this.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.487
We didn't plan anything, Mom.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.005
I'll be back as soon as I can.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.203
Remember to take your vitamins.

20:52.520 --> 20:53.521
Rebecca.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.763
- What's going on?
- We're going home.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.001
No, no, no.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.487
Rebecca, please!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.570
I'm sorry, Mom.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.644
Okay. Here we are.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.002
You can take the bed.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.964
Or the couch, if you want.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.406
No.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.770
This is good.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.531
Okay.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.526
Cool.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.891
My God.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.725
This your idea?

21:42.120 --> 21:43.281
What do you mean?

21:43.520 --> 21:46.524
- Bringing the kid here?
- Yeah, he's not safe there.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.246
So, you call the lady at the school.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.409
That's what CPS is for.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.050
Exactly this.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.007
- He's my brother.
- And she's his mother.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.247
So?

21:58.920 --> 22:02.925
Are you doing this to help him
or to hurt her?

22:06.920 --> 22:08.570
You should leave now.

22:25.080 --> 22:29.722
I know it's a little past dinner time,
so we can call this a midnight snack.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.365
Do you want crust or no crust?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.688
Um, yeah, crust is fine.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.810
Can you make them triangles?

22:40.280 --> 22:43.011
Yeah. You're just like your big sister.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.406
I used to love that.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.090
All righty.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.000
There we go.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.447
Okay.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.488
That's good, it's not even... Oh!

22:57.800 --> 22:59.245
- Ow!
- Sorry.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.204
You had a knot.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.480
Rebecca?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.121
Yeah?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.322
If Mom's crazy,

23:10.280 --> 23:12.089
does it mean we're crazy, too?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.601
No.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.731
Martin?

24:01.680 --> 24:02.966
Hey.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.844
What are you doing down there?

24:12.800 --> 24:15.326
You have to turn the light switch...

26:17.600 --> 26:18.840
Did you take Martin?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.369
- Uh... What?
- Who is it?

26:22.240 --> 26:23.605
You can't do this.

26:26.680 --> 26:30.048
She's unstable.
It's not a safe environment for him.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.642
- Where is he?
- He's in there getting dressed for school.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.724
Look, think about what you wanna do.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.685
Yeah, I did, and I brought him here.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.850
I'm not talking about
some knee-jerk reaction.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.486
He can't stay here.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.971
Sure he can.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.561
Not with... Rebecca, come on.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.526
You know why I'm here? She called me.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.604
So, Child Services takes
orders from nutjobs now?

26:53.960 --> 26:56.361
I stopped by, in person,
to make sure she was lucid.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.005
And she was.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.965
But, you know what?
That's not how this works.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.326
Why not?

27:02.560 --> 27:03.846
Sophie's his birth mother.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.491
His legal guardian.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.321
To get Martin from her custody
requires you to file charges against her.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.530
Take her to court.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.331
Now, that's a long, painful process.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.125
And that's only the first half.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.528
To keep Martin from being
placed in foster care

27:18.800 --> 27:22.805
requires you to prove yourself
and your home as an appropriate surrogate.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.247
That's two major choices for you to make.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.290
Declaring war on your mother

27:29.360 --> 27:33.206
and transforming yourself into
a responsible guardian for him.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.570
You ready to do that?

27:39.240 --> 27:42.687
I can be a responsible guardian.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.241
It's okay.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.609
I got some sleep.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.969
I'll do better tonight.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.566
Hey.

30:22.960 --> 30:23.961
I got your text. What's up?

30:24.320 --> 30:25.765
Can you take me to my mom's?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.241
- Really? Gonna do this whole thing again?
- Hey!

30:28.440 --> 30:29.771
What? No.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.769
I'll tell you about it in the car.
What are you doing?

30:31.960 --> 30:33.200
Don't you think
we should talk about last night?

30:33.400 --> 30:34.401
What?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.608
About how you kicked me out
for being honest with you?

30:36.760 --> 30:38.250
Oh, um...

30:39.280 --> 30:41.521
Yeah. I'm sorry.

30:41.760 --> 30:42.807
You were right.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.208
I was using Martin to get to Mom.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.363
Thank you for pointing that out.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.000
- Can we...
- Whoa, whoa.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.641
You should apologize to Martin.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.082
Not like that, but you should
still apologize to the kid.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.328
I need to find out about Diana.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.125
The bitch is real.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.168
Wait. Who's Diana?

31:06.120 --> 31:07.690
Mom?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.684
All right, what are we looking for?

31:25.960 --> 31:27.121
You're looking for Mom.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.482
If you see her,
we hit the back door. Got it?

31:29.720 --> 31:30.926
Got it.

33:49.840 --> 33:54.004
Patient 283 admitted October 6, 1984.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.886
The patient suffers
from a unique skin disorder

33:57.120 --> 34:00.442
that manifests itself
in an extreme sensitivity to light.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.807
Uh, patient's stay here
has been very problematic.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.804
She has a history of violence and...

34:08.880 --> 34:10.120
Lately, she's been obsessed with one

34:10.360 --> 34:12.487
of the patients in the heliotherapy ward,

34:12.679 --> 34:14.728
a young girl named Sophie.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.960
Oh, bring her in.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.166
Keep her restraints on. Thank you.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.771
Hello, Diana.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.803
Keep the lights out.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.568
I hear you've been very bad again.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.525
Diana, I want you
to stay away from Sophie.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.324
She's my friend.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.324
Then why did you hurt her?

34:32.679 --> 34:34.762
She was getting better.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.370
Session 13 now.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.971
Patient's skin condition is worsening.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.005
Uh, we're preparing an experimental...

34:42.320 --> 34:43.731
- Hold her down!
- Please!

34:44.040 --> 34:46.725
Using full dosage now. 1200 watts.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.083
Shut it off! Now!

35:00.520 --> 35:01.806
Jesus...

36:32.360 --> 36:33.600
Bret!

36:36.040 --> 36:37.246
Bret!

36:37.880 --> 36:40.201
Stay away.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.521
Stay away, Becca.

36:44.520 --> 36:47.444
I won't be sent away again.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.960
You okay? What happened?

37:00.440 --> 37:02.568
We gotta go, okay? Your mom's here.
We gotta go.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.086
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.401
Oh, shit.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.483
- Oh, God.
- Talk to me. What happened up there?

37:07.720 --> 37:09.404
I don't know.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.166
I was attacked.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.447
Yeah, by what?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.330
I don't know. I can't explain it.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.127
What's all this for?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.128
Proof. It's proof.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.405
I know, I'm just saying

37:25.600 --> 37:27.841
you can talk about
your sister to me, okay?

37:28.040 --> 37:29.280
She's fine.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.842
Did you take your vitamins?

37:32.520 --> 37:35.649
Oh... I am feeling a little better.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.441
But, listen, bud.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.521
I know I've been a little distant lately,
and I really wanna fix that.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.569
How about
a popcorn and movie night tonight?

37:43.800 --> 37:44.961
Yes, please.

37:45.840 --> 37:49.401
Good. I think a little personal time
is just what we need.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.681
All three of us.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.684
- Mom?
- Huh?

37:57.240 --> 37:58.924
How about just you and me tonight?

37:59.320 --> 38:00.321
Okay?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.411
We'll see.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.048
Child, how can you see
with all that light?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.001
Ah, now, that's better.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.289
Now be an angel and run along to Ito and
tell him to bring me a very light breakfast.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.965
How you doing down there?

38:29.240 --> 38:31.447
I'm fine. How are you?

38:33.360 --> 38:35.089
I'm gonna be fine.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.240
I am.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.729
I miss your dad.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.523
He made me feel strong.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.244
He made me feel protected

38:47.560 --> 38:51.201
and I think I need to feel
those things sometimes, you know?

38:51.400 --> 38:52.640
I think you do, too.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.086
I'm okay.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.966
Rebecca's strong.

38:58.160 --> 39:03.121
Uh, Rebecca acts like she's strong,
and she is sometimes,

39:03.520 --> 39:06.046
but, let me tell you,
when things got tough,

39:06.280 --> 39:07.770
she abandoned me.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.571
And I don't want that to happen to you.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.610
Sometimes the strongest thing to do

39:13.840 --> 39:15.569
is just to face your fears.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.602
That's what Emma told me.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.046
Yeah.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.565
I think you might be right.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.245
I'll be back.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.043
Mom?

39:40.360 --> 39:42.203
Hey, it's all right. It's okay, love.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.686
- Mom, what are you doing?
- It's all right.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.928
Look at me, trust me, okay?
I'm gonna tell you a story.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.924
Mom, please, please.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.606
Baby.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.282
It was a long time ago,

39:52.720 --> 39:54.961
and I had a friend named Diana.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.401
She was so different.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.529
So special.

40:00.680 --> 40:01.761
Look at me.

40:02.280 --> 40:06.649
And later, I found out something
really bad happened to her.

40:07.080 --> 40:10.084
But the news...
The news had it wrong, you see.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.010
And she was still there.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.323
And she finally came back.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.802
Mom, please... Please, let go.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.445
No, listen to me. See...

40:18.840 --> 40:22.640
See, I left her alone for so many years.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.330
I abandoned her.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.807
But now, she's going to stay, okay?

40:27.000 --> 40:30.721
As long as I keep my head clear
and you keep the lights out.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.801
No!

40:33.000 --> 40:34.001
Martin!

40:34.360 --> 40:35.646
Martin, don't turn on the lights!

40:36.600 --> 40:37.806
Diana doesn't know any better.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.168
No, Diana!

40:40.720 --> 40:42.768
Diana!

40:43.080 --> 40:45.651
He doesn't understand! He didn't mean it!

40:46.040 --> 40:49.203
Martin, she didn't mean it.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.441
Please, don't do this.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.681
Wait. So your mom
was in a mental institution

41:01.880 --> 41:03.644
when she was younger?

41:04.680 --> 41:05.841
Yeah.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.969
Yeah, looks that way.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.411
You just never talked about it, is all.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.530
Neither did she.

41:16.960 --> 41:20.681
I guess it's not really
something that you talk about.

41:21.720 --> 41:25.281
Yeah, well, how about I just listen?

41:26.160 --> 41:28.925
Because I still don't know who Diana is.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.244
She's...

41:47.240 --> 41:49.004
It's getting worse.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.082
We need to go shopping, babe.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.771
Right. Um...

41:59.240 --> 42:01.163
Can you run to the store?

42:01.600 --> 42:03.489
Okay. Copy that.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.210
See you, bud.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.121
Hey.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.603
You wanna talk about it now?

42:14.560 --> 42:17.245
I know you don't believe me,

42:17.520 --> 42:19.204
but Diana is real.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.448
- She touched my hair.
- Hey, hey, hey!

42:25.000 --> 42:26.570
Listen to me.

42:27.640 --> 42:32.043
I'm gonna tell you something
that nobody ever told me.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.805
I believe you.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.406
I don't know what she is.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.965
She doesn't like the light.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.766
Okay.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.605
Come with me.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.001
Okay.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.682
So, it turns out that your dad

42:57.080 --> 43:00.687
was doing a lot of research
into Mom and Diana's past.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.528
Diana was found in a basement,

43:05.720 --> 43:08.803
locked away when she was 13 years old.

43:09.280 --> 43:12.045
And her father had killed himself.

43:13.760 --> 43:17.651
She had a very strange skin disorder.

43:18.760 --> 43:21.366
There were stories about her.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.760
People used to say that she was evil

43:25.080 --> 43:29.005
and that she could
get inside people's heads,

43:29.240 --> 43:30.651
change them.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.688
She was taken
to Mulberry Hill Psychiatric Hospital,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.445
where she met Mom.

43:37.680 --> 43:41.127
And I think that she got inside Mom's head

43:41.360 --> 43:43.203
and made her think that they were friends.

43:45.480 --> 43:46.720
But they weren't?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.001
No.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.891
Diana only comes around
when Mom is at her worst.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.731
I went through it too when I was your age.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.724
When your dad left?

43:57.960 --> 43:59.166
Yeah.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.201
So, what happened with Diana?

44:03.520 --> 44:06.410
The doctors tried
an experimental treatment on her

44:06.720 --> 44:08.882
and something went wrong.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.844
And she died.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.564
But, if she's dead,

44:18.520 --> 44:20.921
how could she be doing this to us?

44:23.800 --> 44:25.370
I don't know.

44:26.880 --> 44:30.771
But, I think that Mom is the only
connection Diana has to this world.

44:31.760 --> 44:34.286
You know, I think if
we can get Mom better,

44:34.720 --> 44:39.931
get her mind strong again,
then we can maybe break that connection.

44:41.720 --> 44:42.721
No.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.969
Diana won't let that happen.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.521
Why do you say that?

44:49.960 --> 44:52.281
Because that's what
my dad was trying to do.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.486
Okay. It's the food.

45:01.880 --> 45:02.881
Hey.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.327
Bret?

45:39.480 --> 45:40.845
Stay there.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.048
Rebecca!

46:35.400 --> 46:36.890
Oh, God.

46:47.960 --> 46:49.883
Mom, we need to talk.

47:07.800 --> 47:08.926
What?

47:09.280 --> 47:11.567
Can you tell us about Diana?

47:13.920 --> 47:15.445
What are you talking about?

47:15.760 --> 47:16.807
Your friend.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.241
Diana.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.762
Martin said that

47:22.000 --> 47:24.241
she was here an hour ago.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.087
Yes. She's my friend.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.449
Is this your friend, Diana?

47:35.640 --> 47:37.130
Is this her?

47:38.040 --> 47:39.166
Where did you get this?

47:39.400 --> 47:40.561
Answer my question.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.364
No, you answer mine.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.120
You met Diana at Mulberry Hill

47:45.360 --> 47:47.567
when you were taken there
for your depression.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.167
Am I right?

47:49.400 --> 47:50.925
- What does it matter when we met?
- Am I right?

47:51.200 --> 47:53.123
What does it matter when we met?

47:54.000 --> 47:55.286
Because she died.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.284
She died a year after this photo.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.085
That's a lie.
I don't know what you're saying.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.646
It's the truth, Mom. It's the truth.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.121
Stop. Okay, I understand.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.841
You are trying to
take him away from me again.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.889
You're trying to take my son
away from me again,

48:07.120 --> 48:09.088
so you're making up these wild stories.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.322
I found her obituary, Mom.

48:11.560 --> 48:12.641
Explain that!

48:12.960 --> 48:14.803
Those things can be faked!
They can be faked!

48:15.160 --> 48:17.003
You sound crazy. Listen to her.

48:17.320 --> 48:19.448
I know, this all sounds a little crazy.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.803
There is a dead woman in this house

48:23.160 --> 48:24.400
and you let her in, Mom.

48:24.680 --> 48:25.886
You let her stay.

48:26.160 --> 48:27.366
I know. I see.

48:27.640 --> 48:31.645
I get it. You came because you feel bad
about leaving me.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.531
Am I right?

48:34.560 --> 48:35.721
I didn't hear from you.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.288
You didn't come see me like most people.
Do you know how much that hurt me?

48:39.960 --> 48:42.327
And now, as it turns out,

48:42.720 --> 48:46.805
I've been shutting Diana out
the same way, all this time.

48:47.120 --> 48:51.170
And I am not gonna be a kind of person
that does that to a friend.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.647
A friend?

48:53.600 --> 48:54.806
Mom,

48:55.080 --> 48:58.209
we're talking about a dead person.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.891
Oh...

49:00.320 --> 49:01.731
Sweetie,

49:03.000 --> 49:06.083
ghosts aren't real.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.688
Then what is she?

49:14.200 --> 49:15.884
Then what is she?

49:24.600 --> 49:26.887
You can sleep over
at my place again tonight.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.361
I'll call CPS in the morning.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.561
No.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.084
What do you mean, "no"?

49:36.920 --> 49:38.888
Look, I know you've been gone a long time,

49:39.120 --> 49:40.451
but she's our mom.

49:41.200 --> 49:43.521
She needs us now more than ever.

49:44.200 --> 49:45.247
Hey.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.569
I'm not here for her.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.251
I'm here for you.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.090
You're my priority.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.691
I can't just leave her.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.121
Okay.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.090
But it's not safe here.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.163
It's not safe anywhere.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.961
How long does she usually
stay up in her room at night?

50:09.240 --> 50:10.366
Mom?

50:10.640 --> 50:13.610
She doesn't usually
come out again until morning.

50:13.800 --> 50:18.089
Okay, first priority,
we put in some safeguards.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.967
Bret and I are gonna be
on the couch downstairs.

50:47.440 --> 50:48.965
- Okay?
- Okay.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.846
Do you want your door open or closed?

50:52.080 --> 50:53.127
Closed.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.481
Wait.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.121
Can you, uh...

50:58.120 --> 51:00.487
Can you sleep in here tonight?

51:02.160 --> 51:03.491
Sure.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.803
I just have to go tell Bret.
I'll be right back.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.370
You don't have to stay, you know.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.121
I know.

51:50.480 --> 51:53.484
Martin wants me to sleep
up in his room tonight.

51:53.720 --> 51:54.881
Yeah.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.091
He needs you more than I do right now.

51:58.480 --> 52:00.403
Yeah.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.050
Are you still gonna stay?

52:03.240 --> 52:05.129
Unless you say otherwise,

52:05.360 --> 52:06.566
yeah.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.531
Gonna be kind of hard
sleeping with all these lights on.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.122
You must think we're all crazy.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.046
You know,

52:18.880 --> 52:20.166
I don't think that.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.051
Thank you.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.730
You can be this way around me.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.723
I'm not going anywhere.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.081
Bottom drawer.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.001
What?

52:53.360 --> 52:54.566
The, um...

52:54.960 --> 52:56.769
The bottom drawer.

52:57.880 --> 52:59.325
In the dresser.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.611
I will clean it out for you.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.808
- Seriously?
- Mmm... Uh...

53:06.560 --> 53:08.449
Maybe.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.684
Okay. Good night.

53:12.120 --> 53:13.451
Good night.

53:39.480 --> 53:40.686
Mom?

53:42.480 --> 53:45.802
Uh, we're staying overnight.

53:49.360 --> 53:52.170
Okay. I'll see you in the morning.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.645
Love you.

54:02.520 --> 54:04.010
You're staying?

54:05.240 --> 54:06.321
Yeah.

54:07.800 --> 54:08.926
Good.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.690
Um, I was...

54:14.920 --> 54:18.083
I would like, maybe, tomorrow morning,

54:18.400 --> 54:21.085
to start over, if that's okay with you.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.320
Yeah.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.051
Of course.

54:28.200 --> 54:31.682
Did you ever hear from Dad?

54:34.920 --> 54:36.604
Letters or...

54:38.480 --> 54:39.641
No.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.845
I'm sorry.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.771
I wish I had. I really wish you had.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.401
I know you blame me,
and I don't blame you for...

54:48.720 --> 54:50.131
No. I don't.

54:50.440 --> 54:53.444
It was his choice to leave, not yours.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.081
Okay.

55:04.680 --> 55:05.761
Okay.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.241
Oh, shit.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.491
Rebecca?

56:27.640 --> 56:28.926
Yeah?

56:30.560 --> 56:32.642
Did you find her medicine?

56:34.960 --> 56:36.086
No.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.488
But we'll figure something out.

56:40.200 --> 56:41.645
You think so?

56:44.120 --> 56:45.451
Yeah, bud.

56:46.960 --> 56:49.281
We'll make sure she gets better.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.640
Okay.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.883
Get some sleep.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.681
Shit.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.440
Come on.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.206
Bret.

57:40.440 --> 57:41.601
Bret!

57:53.640 --> 57:54.801
Shit.

58:33.440 --> 58:34.566
Shit.

58:41.680 --> 58:43.444
Come on.

58:48.120 --> 58:49.963
Rebecca!

58:59.800 --> 59:01.040
Rebecca?

59:07.760 --> 59:08.966
Rebecca?

59:27.320 --> 59:28.526
Rebecca?

59:35.160 --> 59:36.366
Rebecca?

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.962
Come on.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.283
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.682
- Don't leave me again.
- Okay.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.881
Ever!

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.524
Hey, all right.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.285
Nothing's working.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.601
What else could it be?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.046
A trap.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.447
No!

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.481
No!

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.801
Hey!

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.247
Help!

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.210
Help! Bret!

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.851
Let us out!

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.007
Becks?

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.402
- Let us out!
- Becks!

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.121
Bret!

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.129
Bret, we're down here!

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.761
All right, Becks, hold on.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.641
Mrs. Wells?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.091
No! No! Bret!

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.090
- Bret!
- Mrs. Wells?

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.965
Stay in the light, Bret!

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.446
Bret!

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.569
All right, Becks, hold on.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.530
Ah!

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.961
Okay.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.964
No! Bret!

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.449
Bret? Bret, come here!

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.965
Is he leaving?

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.687
No.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.407
No, no, he wouldn't do that.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.525
You did.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.248
No! Come on!

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.602
That one doesn't last long.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.125
We need to find more light.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.571
Rebecca?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.531
Hello?

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.925
Martin?

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.530
Diana, where are you?

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.569
I told you not to hurt my children.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.887
They don't know any better.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.522
Do not threaten me, Diana.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.011
No, you need me, Diana!

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.720
There's no you without me.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.124
Something that I should have never...

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.682
How long are we gonna be in here?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.445
I don't know.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.128
There's no windows.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.121
Yeah.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.247
I'm working on a plan.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.204
I'm not much help to you.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.641
Hey.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.088
You're doing great. Okay?

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.170
Keep looking through that box.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.640
Um...

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.368
I found a flashlight.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.165
Or something.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.284
It's a black light.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.369
Still got some juice.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.162
Wait. Where are you going?

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.606
To take inventory.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.524
Keep feeding the fire.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.401
Oh, God.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.845
Oh, my God.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.762
"Just like in the hospital."

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.450
"Trapped down here..."

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.326
Holy shit!

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.090
"Take Sophie away from me."

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.927
"Forget Diana."

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.850
Let's go!

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.729
I saw her.
She doesn't disappear in this light.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.127
So?

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.368
So, if we can see her,
at least we know where she is.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.404
And maybe we can even hurt her with this.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.479
What now?

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.361
Mom!

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.801
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.529
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:22.765
Are we gonna die?

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.127
No.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:27.481
We're fighters.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.126
Do you hear me? We're fighters.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.483
She's in there,
my girlfriend and her family.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.763
Sir, get back in your vehicle.
You need to get to a hospital.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.243
- You need flashlights.
- Get back in your car. Okay?

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.881
Unit 81, we're at the Marigold house.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.884
Power grid is out, over.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.651
LAPD.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.445
Anyone home?

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.966
Hello?

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.810
LAPD. We're responding
to the domestic disturbance.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.566
We're here!

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.444
We're down here!

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.165
Help!

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.441
Diana!

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.525
If you hurt my kids,
we are never speaking again!

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.686
Keep the light on us!

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.481
Ma'am?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.445
Show yourself.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.526
Back off!

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.046
Andrews?

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.046
Oh, my God.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.121
Oh, God.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.170
Unit 99. Get me backup. Officer down.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.810
Here, take this.
You won't see her otherwise.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.125
- Take it!
- Stay back.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.890
Take it!

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.925
- We have to go.
- No, we have to get Mom!

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.640
- No, we gotta go!
- No, we're not leaving without Mom!

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.803
Okay, I'll get her, I promise! Come on!

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.610
Right now!

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.127
Becks!

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.926
Go! Go!

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.406
Hey, come here, buddy.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.409
- Get him out of here.
- No!

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.120
- Let go of me!
- I gotcha.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.361
Rebecca!

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.085
I'm going to get Mom!

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.446
Okay.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.326
Mom?

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.881
Mom?

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.161
Stay away.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.326
Or I'll show you where I put your father.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.690
I told you!

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.684
Don't hurt my kids.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.888
Mom, she killed Dad!

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.328
That won't hurt me.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.561
This will.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.564
There is no you without me.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.008
No! Mom, what are you doing?

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.209
Saving your lives.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.971
No!

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.725
Mom!

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.085
I'm here, bud. I got you.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.285
Here you go.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.325
You came back.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.125
Of course.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.605
So did you.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.206
Yeah.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.649
No more running away.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.284
We're here to stay.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.085
Hey, it's okay.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.126
It's nothing.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.802
I got you guys, all right?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.571
Yeah. We're never going away.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.731
Come here.
