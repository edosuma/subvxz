[theme music]

00:49.483 --> 00:51.852
[laughter]

00:51.952 --> 00:54.855
[music playing]

00:57.925 --> 01:00.928
So you really think
this is cool, huh?

01:01.028 --> 01:02.630
Yeah, who said?

01:02.730 --> 01:05.333
Well, I guess the
whole school knows.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.935
What does the
whole school know?

01:08.035 --> 01:09.203
Class picture.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.873
Fourth row, second
from the left.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.642
Oh, my god!

01:14.742 --> 01:15.976
Becky, you're giving the finger!

01:16.076 --> 01:19.180
Let me see!

01:19.280 --> 01:21.515
DJ, go watch TV.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.916
I can't believe it!

01:23.016 --> 01:24.252
The nerd flips the bird!

01:26.920 --> 01:27.855
I'll call you back, OK?

01:27.955 --> 01:29.590
Yeah.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.259
Come on, you were just
scratching your shoulder,

01:31.359 --> 01:32.460
right?

01:32.560 --> 01:33.361
I did it.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.463
Why is that such a big surprise?

01:35.563 --> 01:37.198
Because you're such a
butt kisser, and you never

01:37.298 --> 01:40.768
get in any decent trouble.

01:40.868 --> 01:41.869
Totally impressed.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.537
Wrong, Jackie.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.006
Yep, it was Paul
Revere and the Raiders.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.376
But Mark Lindsay was the singer.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.411
Like there really
was a Paul Revere.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.446
Read the back of the album!

01:52.546 --> 01:54.682
Paul Revere was a blind
guy who played keyboards.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.649
He was the leader.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.618
Well, then how
come he didn't sing?

01:57.718 --> 01:59.987
Because Mark
Lindsay sang better.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.156
Well, then how come it wasn't
Mark Lindsay and the Raiders?

02:02.256 --> 02:07.328
Because Paul's mother let
them practice in their garage.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.163
Oh.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.300
Becky got picture today,
and she won't let me see it.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.904
It's just my class picture.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.472
I didn't want him
to get it all gross.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.740
Well, I paid for it.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.708
Let me see it.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.609
Sure.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.512
See?

02:24.612 --> 02:25.479
I want to see.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.680
- Me first.
- Why?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.015
- 'Cause.
- No fair.

02:28.115 --> 02:31.084
Is too.
Let me see it, Becky.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.019
Where are you?

02:32.119 --> 02:34.822
Oh, you mean,
you can't see me?

02:34.922 --> 02:36.257
Look, everybody!

02:36.357 --> 02:37.725
Daddy's home!

02:37.825 --> 02:41.629
Oh, hi, Daddy!

02:41.729 --> 02:47.067
Hi, princess, bud,
kitten, Margaret.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.140
What is it, our anniversary,
with the big, greasy car

02:53.241 --> 02:54.375
parked there?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.510
Oh, does this finally mean
you're gonna fix her car

02:56.610 --> 02:58.479
and I don't have to
drive her around anymore?

02:58.579 --> 02:59.547
Come on.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.814
We've been having a
lot of fun together.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.049
Yeah.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.851
It's a lot of fun listening
to you give directions.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.987
Speed up, slow down, turn
left, turn right, date him,

03:07.087 --> 03:08.556
don't date him.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.723
Well, don't worry.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.226
I finally got the part
I've been looking for.

03:12.326 --> 03:15.062
All I got to do is wash it
off and figure out what it is.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.064
Oh, look.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.600
This guy's giving the
old one-digit salute.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.601
Yeah, where?

03:20.701 --> 03:21.602
Right here.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.672
It's very, very
subtle, under the chin.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.275
There's another
one around the back.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.809
Oh, look it, a double.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.478
The guy with the arms crossed.
- Brilliant.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.845
- Yeah.
- Bravo, bravo.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.781
Yeah, here's the guy
adjusting his glasses.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.148
ROSEANNE: No, he's
just rubbing his eye.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.149
JACKIE: No, look at the elbow.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.117
Oh, a mislead.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.052
Yeah.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.554
Let me try to find one now.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.100
Just remember you
thought it was funny

03:53.200 --> 03:56.069
when the other kids did it.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.306
Yeah, but the other
kids aren't my kid.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.474
Right, Dan?
- Not to my knowledge, dear.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.313
Well, I'll leave
you guys alone

04:05.413 --> 04:08.215
since I know how disappointed
you must be in Becky.

04:08.316 --> 04:12.152
By the way, I think I'm
getting a D in math.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.255
Go on up to your room.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.156
What's Becky doing?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.057
DJ--

04:17.157 --> 04:19.893
DJ, go watch TV.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.295
I can't believe it's Becky.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.463
Yeah.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.264
This is almost as good
as his version of we're

04:24.365 --> 04:26.734
number one in the
football picture.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.869
That was a classic.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.938
Your parents were
so very overjoyed.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.541
Oh, they were so uncool.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.642
I don't know, Dan.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.677
I think, well, we
ought to do something.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.879
Well, I'm certainly not
gonna punish her for this.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.880
No, I know that.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.649
But, I mean, we've
got to be parents.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.717
We don't have
to be our parents.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.253
We can't bust her for the
same things that we did.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.856
Yeah, but, I mean,
on one hand, I--

04:48.956 --> 04:50.958
I don't want her to
think we approve.

04:51.058 --> 04:55.329
Then on the other hand, I feel
so close to her right now.

04:58.866 --> 05:05.639
Say, guys, um, your son
just gave Gilligan the finger.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.108
ROSEANNE: Dan.

05:08.208 --> 05:12.112
Well, he's the reason they're
still stuck on that island.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.013
Dan--

05:13.113 --> 05:14.081
All right, all right.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.949
DJ?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.951
Get in here, little buddy.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.353
- Becky!
- Yeah?

05:19.453 --> 05:20.488
DAN: Have a seat.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.389
OK.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.723
Let's see.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.492
Uh, how can I explain this?

05:24.592 --> 05:25.759
Ah.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.660
OK.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.195
This is the church.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.797
This is the steeple.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.699
Open the doors, and
you see the big guy

05:31.799 --> 05:34.267
sitting there in third row?

05:34.368 --> 05:37.070
Just don't ever stick him
up in the air at anybody.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.507
But Mom did it
when she was driving.

05:42.476 --> 05:46.179
Well, the idiot cuts me off.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.048
Scoot.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.719
I better go see if this fits.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.587
You know, they've been
taking these pictures forever.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.923
You'd think the photographer
would get wise to it.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.092
Well, every generation
thinks they're the first.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.661
You know that
picture of Washington

06:00.761 --> 06:01.795
crossing the Delaware?

06:01.895 --> 06:04.632
The guy in the back, he
looks like he's rowing?

06:04.732 --> 06:09.302
See, now, you think the
painter would have caught that.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.804
So how much trouble am I in.

06:10.904 --> 06:11.705
Sit down.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.077
So?

06:17.177 --> 06:20.481
So this doesn't
seem like you, Becky.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.782
Did you know these guys?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.785
I mean, was it some kind of
a dare thing or something?

06:24.885 --> 06:25.919
No, I just did it.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.320
I don't know why.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.322
Well, just don't do it again
or you're gonna get grounded.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.223
OK.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.462
Is that it?

06:34.562 --> 06:37.164
You're gonna do the dishes
tonight, too, and that's final.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.099
But Mom, it's my
turn to do the dishes.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.035
Yeah, well nobody
has to know that.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.337
[music playing]

06:45.839 --> 06:47.274
Yeah, that's correct, Amy.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.978
Fourth row, second
from the left.

06:51.078 --> 06:55.215
Yeah, her name's Becky
Conner, my sister.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.551
I do too have a sister.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.853
She's just been in
a reform school.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.558
Darlene, you want
to hand me that dish?

07:04.658 --> 07:05.526
Oh, got to go, Amy.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.426
Fingers needs me.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.566
Here you go, sis.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.739
Thanks.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.041
That was Amy Williams.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.044
Her sister's a senior, and
even she knows about it.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.713
Seniors are talking about me?

07:25.813 --> 07:26.980
Everyone is.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.485
It's like all of a
sudden, you're cool.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.921
Well, I've always been cool.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.424
But sometimes, it's
just cooler not to flash

07:37.525 --> 07:40.427
how cool you really are.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.531
ROSEANNE: We should
just get a new car.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.398
That car was built
the year Becky was born.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.067
It's got a lot of history.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.536
We just bought it a year ago.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.203
It's got somebody
else's history.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.438
We can't afford
our own history.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.673
[phone ringing]

07:52.773 --> 07:55.275
Well, maybe we ought to
just go get a new used car.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.010
You know, like maybe a '81.

07:57.110 --> 07:57.945
Oh, an '81.

07:58.045 --> 07:58.846
Dream on!

08:04.852 --> 08:06.820
Yeah, hold on a minute.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.822
Uh, it's for a Mrs. Conner.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.923
DAN: Sounds serious.

08:10.023 --> 08:10.824
Who is it?

08:10.924 --> 08:11.825
It's Becky's school.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.330
Hello, this is a Mrs. Conner.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.332
Uh-huh.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.735
Jeez!

08:21.835 --> 08:22.803
No, OK.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.072
I'll be there.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.139
What?

08:26.239 --> 08:28.108
You and your finger
just got suspended.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.009
Cool!

08:32.813 --> 08:34.081
Cool?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.016
You think it's cool that I have
to go and see the principal

08:36.116 --> 08:37.317
and take time off of my job?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.485
You think that's cool, huh?

08:38.586 --> 08:42.289
Uh, Becky?

08:42.389 --> 08:44.191
And don't you be
thinking that you're

08:44.291 --> 08:45.893
just gonna lay around
here on your butt

08:45.993 --> 08:48.161
and look at TV, either.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.663
There's plenty stuff
to do around here.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.999
Dan, you're gonna be home
fixing the car, right?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.533
Well, you make sure
she does it all.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.768
Check.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.437
But Mom, a minute ago,
you said it was no big deal!

08:57.537 --> 09:01.508
Well, that was before
you got me in trouble!

09:01.609 --> 09:03.677
Now I got to go to your school.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.846
And I don't want
to go to school!

09:05.946 --> 09:06.747
Oh, don't worry, honey.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.948
It'll be all right.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
Hey, if you run into that
assistant principal who

09:10.150 --> 09:12.352
told me I'd never
amount to anything,

09:12.452 --> 09:15.756
tell him Dr. Conner says hi.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.692
[music playing]

09:23.196 --> 09:25.532
Um, I'm Rebecca Conner's mom.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.134
I'm here to see the principal.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.501
He'll be right with you.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.738
Please, take a seat
with the other mothers.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.275
Finger?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.576
We're all fingers over here.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.286
Roseanne Harris?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.321
I used to be.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.990
Well, I don't believe it!

09:50.090 --> 09:51.591
Neither do I.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.126
What is it, 15 years?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.828
It's at least that long.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.797
Isn't this weird
running into each other?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.132
Especially at the
principal's office.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.701
I'll tell you
what's really weird.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.269
What?

10:02.369 --> 10:06.606
I don't have the
foggiest idea who you are.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.876
Anne-Marie.

10:08.976 --> 10:09.877
Dixon?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.812
It's Mitchell now.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.480
What, did you marry
Chuckie Mitchell?

10:13.580 --> 10:14.481
Yeah.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.883
Who would have thought?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.317
You?

10:17.417 --> 10:20.153
Well, remember that real
good-looking blonde guy that

10:20.253 --> 10:21.154
took me to the junior dance?

10:21.254 --> 10:22.055
Yeah.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.356
OK, he dumped me.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.263
I ended up with Dan Conner.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.905
It's really good to see you.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.639
Yeah.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.476
Boy, this place really
brings back memories.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.179
Like the time we got dragged
in here for burning our bras,

10:46.279 --> 10:47.580
and you stood up
to Principal Lieb

10:47.681 --> 10:50.984
and said it was a
political statement?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.252
You know, Anne-Marie,
it wasn't even

10:52.352 --> 10:54.121
my bra that I burned.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.858
It was Sally Glimpscher's
little tiny bra.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.059
No.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.161
Now, she didn't need it,
and I had gym that day,

11:01.261 --> 11:04.097
so I figured I wasn't gonna go--

11:04.197 --> 11:06.767
I wasn't gonna get on
the, you know, trampoline.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.037
I could have hurt somebody.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.872
I remember Sally Glimpscher.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.107
Boy, she was always in trouble.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.710
I think they were just
giving her conjugal visits

11:16.810 --> 11:19.146
in detention.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.748
So tell, me which one's yours?

11:20.848 --> 11:22.215
Mmm, right there.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.683
Ah.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.152
Mhm.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.555
It's her first obscene gesture.

11:28.655 --> 11:32.993
Her father and I
are just so proud.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.161
Here's Chucki, Jr.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.062
Wow, jeez.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.263
He's got his father's finger.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.164
Yeah.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.004
This is taking
a while, isn't it?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.939
Boy, I hope I'm not
gonna be late for work.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.640
Me, too.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.542
And I hope I can talk this
guy out of the three-day

11:49.642 --> 11:50.778
suspension deal.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.079
I hope I can talk at all.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.480
Jeez.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.048
I feel like I'm 15
years old and I'm

11:55.148 --> 11:56.716
gonna have to sit
and listen to old man

11:56.817 --> 11:59.186
Lieb tell me what a
horrible person I am.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.487
Man.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.522
I used to just sit there
and gnaw on my fingernails,

12:02.622 --> 12:04.024
you know?
- Yeah.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.358
Of course, now
they've grown back,

12:05.458 --> 12:07.895
and I think I can handle it.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.430
Principal Hiller
will see you now.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.364
I didn't do nothing!

12:11.464 --> 12:12.365
Ann-Marie did!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.834
Get out of here!

12:17.938 --> 12:20.974
Ladies, thanks
for coming down.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.510
Please, have a seat.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.213
Boy, everything sure
looks a lot smaller.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.114
No offense.

12:30.317 --> 12:34.687
Now, what do we
think about this?

12:34.788 --> 12:35.755
Mrs.--

12:35.856 --> 12:36.656
Mitchell.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.225
Mitchell, yeah.

12:38.325 --> 12:43.096
And your, uh, son has been
suspended for three days.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.565
True.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.601
Well, you-- you must
have an opinion about that?

12:48.701 --> 12:50.871
And I'd like to hear what it is.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.572
Well, I really
think three days

12:52.672 --> 12:54.207
suspension is a little much.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.308
I think she's right.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.243
Mhm.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.878
You know, I have
to agree here.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.312
Now, I'm not saying
that flipping the bird

12:59.412 --> 13:00.447
is right or anything.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.482
But, I mean, three
days is a long time.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.717
I mean, couldn't you
just start smaller, OK?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.786
Say like first, a warning.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.189
And then maybe detention,
something like that?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.257
OK.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.593
You may be right,
but I don't think so.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.229
You see, I think
this is the warning.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.865
Next time they're down
for something like this,

13:17.965 --> 13:19.732
it'll be two weeks.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.869
Oh, two weeks at
home watching TV.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.103
Boy, that'll really 'em mad.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.675
And you are?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.378
Roseanne Harris-- uh, Conner.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.215
Well, it's easy to see
where Becky gets her attitude.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.583
What do you mean by that?

13:36.683 --> 13:38.351
She's-- she's, uh, 16.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.987
She gets really good grades.

13:40.087 --> 13:40.988
She's not pregnant.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.991
I'd say that's
damn near perfect.

13:44.091 --> 13:49.196
Well, I have evidence to the
contrary here, Mrs. Conner.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.164
Well, so what are you
saying, that she's a bad kid?

13:51.264 --> 13:53.033
Or you calling me a bad mother?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.802
Well, now, I know how
hard it is to juggle

13:55.903 --> 13:57.537
a career and children.

13:57.637 --> 14:01.174
Hey, uh, my children
are my career, OK?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.675
You must be talking
about my job, which

14:02.775 --> 14:03.843
you're making me late for.

14:03.944 --> 14:04.744
Me too.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.379
I sympathize, ladies.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.948
Really, I do.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.717
But I just can't do
this all by myself.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.886
Now, maybe you could spend the
next few days with your kids

14:12.986 --> 14:15.288
and teach them a little
something about respect--

14:15.388 --> 14:18.558
respect for others,
respect for themselves.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.162
Uh, do your kids do this
in the family pictures?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.063
No way.

14:23.163 --> 14:23.964
No.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.098
They do it here.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.299
That's right.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.267
Oh, I see.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.635
Following that
logic, Mrs. Conner,

14:28.735 --> 14:30.403
as long as they're not stealing
anything out of your living

14:30.503 --> 14:31.504
room, it's not
your fault if they

14:31.604 --> 14:33.073
hold up a convenience store.

14:33.173 --> 14:36.609
Hey, we're not talking
about armed robbery here, OK?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.512
We're talking about some
teenagers flipping the bird.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.847
I think we should get over it.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.121
Maybe you're right,
but I don't think so.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.290
And neither do all these
parents who have called

14:50.390 --> 14:52.059
in to complain about the photo.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.826
They want us to
reshoot it at our cost.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.596
And quite frankly, Mrs. Conner,
that is not within our budget.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.165
So what would you
have me tell them

14:58.265 --> 15:01.034
about what your daughter did?

15:01.134 --> 15:05.372
Uh, that it's a
political statement?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.245
Funny.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.746
But I don't think
they would laugh.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.915
And I don't think they want
to get over it, either,

15:16.016 --> 15:19.352
Mrs. Conner, you see, because
they did their job as parents.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.188
And if you're not going to
do yours, then it's up to me

15:21.288 --> 15:22.990
to make sure that this
never happens again,

15:23.090 --> 15:28.228
which I can do by handing out
a longer suspension next time.

15:28.328 --> 15:32.132
Now, let's try this again.

15:32.232 --> 15:36.936
What do we want
to do about this?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.806
[music playing]

15:43.376 --> 15:44.377
OK.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.545
Did you drain the oil
out the crank case?

15:45.645 --> 15:46.446
BECKY: Yeah.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.580
Take the filter off?

15:47.680 --> 15:48.982
Uh-huh.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.052
DAN: Did you put you off from
the filter into that pan there?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.287
Yeah, all this black
stuff came squirting out.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.556
OK, slide on out here.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.025
Thank god.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.192
Yeah.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.127
Now you're ready to lube.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.534
You know, Dad,
It's not like I don't

16:07.634 --> 16:09.169
like all this or anything.

16:09.269 --> 16:14.341
But I think Mom kind of wanted
me to work in the house.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.675
Mom's not here.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.947
Dad, I hate all this!

16:21.048 --> 16:22.015
DAN: I know you do, Becky.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.383
But you're keeping
your old dad company.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.718
And damn it, we're having fun!

16:25.818 --> 16:27.720
Now get back on under there.

16:31.924 --> 16:32.725
BECKY: Dad?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.661
Yeah.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.263
BECKY: What am I supposed to do?

16:36.363 --> 16:37.530
Oh, I'm sorry, Becky.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.898
You know those pointy
doohickeys I showed you before?

16:38.998 --> 16:39.866
BECKY: Yeah.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.134
Just point your
gun at 'em and fire.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.970
BECKY: OK.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.206
Ew, all this yellow
slime is oozing out!

16:46.306 --> 16:47.740
Oh, my god!
Get out of there, quick!

16:54.013 --> 16:54.881
Sorry about that.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.116
It was a little garage humor.

16:59.018 --> 16:59.919
Real funny, Dad.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.356
Ew!

17:03.456 --> 17:04.257
Look at my hands!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.326
They're all greasy and dirty.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.227
Here you go.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.328
Wipe 'em off on this sandwich.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.007
Say, Dad, were
you ever suspended?

17:21.108 --> 17:23.610
- Just once.
- Really, for what?

17:23.710 --> 17:27.547
Snoring too loud in detention.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.016
Spent the next three days
tuning up my dad's Rambler.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.619
So this is kind of like a
time-honored family tradition,

17:32.719 --> 17:35.488
huh?
- You bet.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.456
Get on back under there, now.

17:39.959 --> 17:43.263
[music playing]

17:46.299 --> 17:47.066
Hi, Mom.

17:47.167 --> 17:47.967
Hi.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.968
Where's you dad?

17:49.068 --> 17:49.836
DARLENE: In the garage.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.176
What, no hug and kiss
for your good daughter?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.844
Soon as I get one.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.748
Hi, Mom.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.483
What are you doing
with Becky's picture?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.618
I put that in my
special hiding place.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.921
That's where I found it.

18:09.021 --> 18:13.360
Mom, how come Becky's got
three hands in this picture?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.162
- Three hands?
- Yeah, look.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.829
Let me see.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.600
[gasp] She didn't do it.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.636
I'll kill her!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.338
Well, Beck, this
turned out pretty good.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.506
If you ever get
expelled, you can

18:26.606 --> 18:27.507
always fall back on lube work.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.317
You know, don't you?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.218
Know what?

18:38.318 --> 18:39.152
Have a look, Dan.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.990
It's not your finger, is it?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.958
Could have been.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.329
Hey, Becky's got three hands.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.230
Catch up, Dan.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.601
What do you mean,
could have been?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.703
It was the kid next to me.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.205
How come you
didn't say anything?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.006
Well, the picture
came out, and everyone

19:00.106 --> 19:01.040
thought I was so close.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.476
And you two didn't seem to care.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.111
So I figured, hey, I'm popular.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.413
Might as well go with it.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.349
And then you got suspended.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.518
And then I had to go down
to the principal's office

19:11.618 --> 19:13.119
and get humiliated.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.488
How long were you
gonna go with this?

19:15.588 --> 19:18.291
Till now?

19:18.391 --> 19:21.194
You let your mom take the
heat so you could be popular?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.295
I'm sorry.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.796
But it's not like I
got away with anything.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.131
I got suspended.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.165
Yeah?

19:26.266 --> 19:27.867
Well, you're going
to school tomorrow.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.236
I can't go to school tomorrow.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.938
Oh, yes, you can. 'Cause I'm
gonna take another hour off

19:32.038 --> 19:33.640
of work and go down there
and straighten everything

19:33.740 --> 19:35.074
out with our principal.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.276
Mom, if I go down
there, everyone

19:36.376 --> 19:38.044
will know I didn't do it!

19:38.144 --> 19:39.779
Yeah, life sucks, don't it?

19:42.649 --> 19:43.750
I can't believe this!

19:43.850 --> 19:45.352
You guys weren't mad when
you thought I did do it,

19:45.452 --> 19:47.520
and now you're mad
because you know I didn't?

19:47.620 --> 19:50.357
God, maybe next year, I
ought to moon the class photo

19:50.457 --> 19:52.525
so you guys are proud of me.

19:52.625 --> 19:56.563
Just make sure
it's your own butt.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.432
[music playing]

20:04.804 --> 20:06.439
Mrs. Conner,
you'll have to wait.

20:06.539 --> 20:10.643
Oh, I've been waiting
for this all of my life.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.646
I'm back.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.114
What is it, Mrs. Conner.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.883
Fourth row, second
from the left.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.889
Hey, did you ever lay awake
nights thinking, jeez,

20:22.989 --> 20:24.824
if I only had that one
moment to live over again

20:24.924 --> 20:26.593
I would do it differently?

20:26.693 --> 20:29.596
I'm having that moment,
and you're in it.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.863
OK.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.799
Obviously, there's
been a little mistake.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.634
And I will lift
Becky's suspension.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.337
And I think an
apology's in order.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.471
OK.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.006
I think you're right.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.441
I'm sorry, Mrs. Conner.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.742
And what about the
other mothers that

20:42.842 --> 20:44.277
were in here with me yesterday?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.612
Well, their children
really did it.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.979
So, what?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.816
Their kid makes one mistake,
and that makes them bad mothers?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.518
Well, I do believe that
how a student behaves

20:51.618 --> 20:53.953
reflects the attitudes
of the parent.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.323
Now, what if I was to
tell you that Becky wishes

20:56.423 --> 20:57.424
she had flipped the bird.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.858
What kind of mother
would that make me?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.159
I have already apolo--

21:00.259 --> 21:02.395
I will tell you what kind
of mother that makes me, Mr.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.097
Hiller-- the exact same
kind of mother that I was

21:05.197 --> 21:06.833
when I was in there yesterday.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.835
Because no matter how much
we try to control what

21:08.935 --> 21:11.070
our kids do, at some
point, they are just

21:11.170 --> 21:12.739
gonna do what they're gonna do.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.240
They are like people that way.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.442
Mhm.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.044
But isn't it our job,
Mrs. Conner, to make sure

21:18.144 --> 21:20.212
that they become
responsible, mature adults?

21:20.313 --> 21:21.147
Oh, absolutely.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.449
Absolutely.

21:22.549 --> 21:25.718
But we must remember, Mr.
Hiller, that it's not easy.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.887
Like, say when I'm in
here next year because

21:27.987 --> 21:30.256
of something that my Darlene--

21:30.357 --> 21:31.591
and I will be here.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.865
Just remember that today,
I was a good mother.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.967
I'll do that, Mrs. Conner.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.635
See you next year.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.371
Tuesdays will be good for me.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.407
