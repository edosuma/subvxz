34:29.233 --> 34:31.669
Ever, you have a secret admirer.

34:31.669 --> 34:34.839
What? No, it could just be
someone being nice.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.575
People don't draw other people
in beautiful, pensive poses

34:37.575 --> 34:39.343

madly in love with them.

34:40.611 --> 34:42.847
Okay, whoever did this
is totally into you

34:42.847 --> 34:44.182
and would die for you.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.651
Hi.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.188
I bet it's Spencer.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.091
Wait, no,
he can't draw for shit.

34:57.228 --> 34:58.729
Ooh. Maybe Benji.

34:59.163 --> 35:00.231
He goes to RISD.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.667
Oh, my God, it's totally Benji.

Li Han told me he saw you

35:43.441 --> 35:45.743

the campus last night.

35:46.143 --> 35:47.478
Hi, headmistress.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.647
Oh, loving the cardigan today.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.183
He must be mistaken
about my roomie here

35:52.183 --> 35:54.051
because we were together
all last night,

35:54.051 --> 35:55.620
working on Ever's Mandarin.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.889

36:14.739 --> 36:16.641
Oh, thank you.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.442
You know,
I'm pretty sure my parents

36:18.442 --> 36:20.478
spent their life savings
to send me here,

36:20.478 --> 36:23.481
so if I got expelled
for sneaking out or lying...

36:23.981 --> 36:26.817

begin to describe it. (CHUCKLES)

SOPHIE: Xavier's dad's here.
He lives in Taipei.

36:41.098 --> 36:42.333
He must have
gotten in trouble too.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.268
His family is super loaded.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.704
Okay, I heard that his mom
is a Danish supermodel,

36:46.704 --> 36:48.472
and his dad is half-Japanese,
half-Taiwanese,

36:48.472 --> 36:49.874
which is probably why he's here.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.242

36:51.709 --> 36:53.911
Definitely not from
the <i>World Journal.</i>

36:54.612 --> 36:58.649

somebody has a crush.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.885
Um. Obviously.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.321
We had such a moment last night.
Could you tell?

37:03.321 --> 37:04.956
Like, there were
definitely sparks.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.325
I would kill just to
have the chance

37:07.325 --> 37:08.626
to have my heart broken by him.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.494
All right,
maybe tonight we could--

37:10.494 --> 37:12.430
Whoa! Tonight? No, no, no.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.432
It's so early in the summer.

37:14.432 --> 37:16.567
So?
People don't date

37:16.567 --> 37:18.669
the first person
they hook up with here.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.705
Now, we have to
play the slow game.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.440
It's called Loveboat
for a reason.

37:23.741 --> 37:24.742
Oh, hey.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.944
Hey, is everything
all right down there?

37:26.944 --> 37:28.145
We saw--
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.513
It was just my dad.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.882
Nothing new.
What's going on with you two?

37:31.882 --> 37:34.952
Well, Ever was just wondering
why it's called Loveboat.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.454
Oh, you haven't heard the story?

37:38.556 --> 37:40.725
Well, let me tell you
the story of Loveboat.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.461
So, the program started
for college students

37:43.461 --> 37:45.329
to learn about
Taiwanese culture, right?

37:45.329 --> 37:48.633
Well, one year,
I think back in the '70s,

37:49.133 --> 37:50.768
a big typhoon hit Taipei.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.237
(CURIOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

XAVIER: <i>Two students
got trapped in the storm.</i>

37:56.374 --> 37:58.442
<i>And they were trying
to get back to Huwei.</i>

37:58.442 --> 37:59.844
<i>The water was rising fast.</i>

37:59.844 --> 38:01.846
<i>But they managed to
find a rowboat,</i>

38:01.846 --> 38:03.280
<i>and they climbed in.</i>

38:04.615 --> 38:06.283
<i>Taipei got completely flooded.</i>

38:06.283 --> 38:07.585
<i>It was actually really bad.</i>

38:08.019 --> 38:10.755
<i>But those two stayed safe
in a little rowboat.</i>

38:11.756 --> 38:13.257
<i>And on that day,</i>

38:13.257 --> 38:14.792
<i>in that little rowboat,</i>

38:15.559 --> 38:17.428
<i>those two fell in love.</i>

38:18.095 --> 38:20.364
So, Loveboat.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.836
Since then, it's been
a little bit less about learning

38:25.836 --> 38:27.004
and more about love.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.807
I mean, even parents
push their kids to come here,

38:29.807 --> 38:31.609
hoping that they find
someone to marry.

38:32.610 --> 38:35.246
Oh, my God,
that story is so freaking cute.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.615
Especially the way
that you told it.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.084
Well, that's probably
because I made it up.

you got Dutch periods of rule,

so that when you take
one of these dumplings

you got all that history,

they were pregnant with me...

he quit his job
and they moved to the U.S.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.844
He couldn't afford
to go through residency again,

41:19.844 --> 41:23.414
