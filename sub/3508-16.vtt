00:00.458 --> 00:01.437
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.464 --> 00:03.064
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.398 --> 00:05.124
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.362 --> 00:06.384
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.785 --> 00:07.385
Who am I?

00:07.474 --> 00:08.613
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.614 --> 00:09.014
Castle.

00:09.048 --> 00:09.708
Castle.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.709
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.855 --> 00:14.045
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.255 --> 00:15.074
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.109 --> 00:16.129
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.164 --> 00:18.070
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.116 --> 00:19.602
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.603 --> 00:20.603
I get to be on her case.

00:20.637 --> 00:22.580
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.615 --> 00:23.491
And together, we catch killers

00:24.439 --> 00:25.427
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.428 --> 00:26.428
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.562 --> 00:27.256
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.619 --> 00:29.219
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

One and two. Three and f--
Why you all Beyoncé this morning?

01:02.370 --> 01:05.016
You got a school dance coming up?
No.

01:05.051 --> 01:06.990
Ashley gave me
some of her cheer routine.

01:07.024 --> 01:08.929
She's been on the J.V.
for two years,

01:08.964 --> 01:11.704
And she wants me
to tryout for the squad.
Cheerleading?

01:11.738 --> 01:13.282
Yeah. Why?

01:13.283 --> 01:14.883
Who are you and what have you
done with my daughter?

01:15.517 --> 01:17.422
What's wrong
with cheerleading?

01:17.457 --> 01:19.495
No, no, nothing's--
nothing's...

01:19.530 --> 01:23.006
I'm just--I didn't know
you... wanted to be one.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.443
Me either.

01:24.477 --> 01:26.817
But I watched Ashley practice,
and it looks like fun.

01:26.851 --> 01:29.189
And my college counselor,
ms. Schaefer,

01:29.224 --> 01:31.429
said I need to consider
diversifying my activities.

01:31.463 --> 01:34.371
I figure I'm a natural 'cause I
root for you all the time.

01:36.009 --> 01:37.747
Oh, I gotta go.

01:37.781 --> 01:39.786
Love you.
Have fun.

01:39.820 --> 01:42.058
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

01:42.092 --> 01:43.896
Cheerleading?

01:43.931 --> 01:45.299
So?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.739
Who--
ah. The time you wanted
to play hockey

01:47.773 --> 01:49.481
because all the cool guys
in school were playing it?

01:49.482 --> 01:50.682
Yeah,
but I didn't join the team.

01:50.815 --> 01:52.886
Well, no, because you
knocked out two teeth

01:52.920 --> 01:55.458
at the first practice.

01:55.493 --> 01:59.536
Darling... let Alexis figure
this out on her own, hmm?

01:59.571 --> 02:02.543
This coming from the woman
who just last week told <i>me</i>

02:02.577 --> 02:05.150
not to reserve a seat
on the space shuttle?

02:05.185 --> 02:07.522
Oh. Well, we have to
rethink that.

02:07.557 --> 02:09.461
Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:15.676 --> 02:18.449
Vic's a female, late 20s,
no I.D.

02:18.483 --> 02:20.389
She was found
hanging from the monkey bars

02:20.423 --> 02:22.397
by a jogger just after dawn.

02:22.598 --> 02:23.598
Is that honey?

02:24.731 --> 02:26.503
From the smell of it,
I'd say it's caramel sauce.

02:26.638 --> 02:28.641
But I'll be testing,
not tasting.

02:28.642 --> 02:29.642
Caramel sauce?

02:29.875 --> 02:31.348
Maybe our killer has
a sweet tooth.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.449
Given her state
of undress,

02:32.482 --> 02:34.122
I'd say it's more likely
he had a sexual fetish.

02:34.523 --> 02:35.923
Yeah, I can do
the chocolate,

02:36.090 --> 02:38.996
I'll even do the whipped cream
bikini, but caramel?

02:39.030 --> 02:42.002
I prefer slippery
to sticky.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.574
Does she know
we can hear her?

02:44.608 --> 02:47.080
Bondage cuffs, custom made?

02:47.115 --> 02:49.619
Looks like our killer
liked public play.

02:49.653 --> 02:52.091
How can you tell the difference
between custom and regular?

02:52.125 --> 02:54.630
The leather is too high quality
to be mass-produced,

02:54.697 --> 02:56.234
and it's hand-stitched.

02:56.268 --> 02:59.106
No, I mean, how can <i>you</i>
tell the difference?

03:01.312 --> 03:03.550
So time of death?
From body temperature,

03:03.584 --> 03:06.056
I'd say between 10:00
and 11:00 last night,

03:06.091 --> 03:08.328
But I'm pretty sure
she was not killed here.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.298
Based on lividity,
she spent several hours

03:10.333 --> 03:12.436
in the fetal position
after she died.

03:12.470 --> 03:15.343
And then was hung here
a few hours ago.

03:15.377 --> 03:17.714
Petechial hemorrhaging
suggests she was suffocated.

03:17.749 --> 03:20.554
And then there's these.

03:20.589 --> 03:23.126
Was she restrained?
Looks like it.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.298
Yo, Beckett.

03:25.332 --> 03:27.369
Crime scene's negative
for any signs of a struggle.

03:27.404 --> 03:29.340
Found about a dozen
partial shoe impressions,

03:29.374 --> 03:31.644
But the ground's too cold
to get any imprints.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.517
But... we did find this.

03:34.551 --> 03:36.488
Wheel marks,
about 18 inches apart.

03:37.458 --> 03:38.498
Rolling suitcase?

03:38.499 --> 03:40.099
And judging by
the depth of the tracks,

03:41.132 --> 03:43.236
I'd say it was carrying
something heavy.

03:43.270 --> 03:45.307
I'm guessing around, uh,
105 pounds.

03:45.342 --> 03:47.480
So he killed her elsewhere
and then brought her here.

03:47.481 --> 03:49.381
Yeah, which means the crime scene
could be anywhere.

03:49.415 --> 03:51.988
The psychology
doesn't make any sense.

03:52.022 --> 03:54.426
The crime scene was
pretty elaborately staged,

03:54.460 --> 03:55.863
which seems to suggest

03:55.897 --> 03:57.833
a significant amount
of premeditation,

03:57.867 --> 03:59.704
but the murder itself--
suffocation--

03:59.738 --> 04:00.677
might indicate
a crime of passion.

04:00.678 --> 04:01.978
Guy covered her in caramel.

04:02.012 --> 04:04.349
Do you really think we're gonna
find a logical explanation?

04:04.785 --> 04:07.454
Only a handful of bondage shops
in the city do custom work.

04:07.589 --> 04:09.260
So let's take photos
of those cuffs, send it out,

04:09.295 --> 04:10.865
see if anyone can I.D.
where it came from.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.869
"only a handful of shops"?

04:13.903 --> 04:15.940
Okay, what aren't you
telling me?

04:16.875 --> 04:21.146
So much, Castle.
So very, very much.

04:28.323 --> 04:31.060
<i>♪</i>

04:31.094 --> 04:34.031
It's a little creepy doing this
with you breathing on my neck.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.068
Oh, sorry, bro. I mean,
I'd do it on mine,

04:35.103 --> 04:37.472
but I.A. checks
browser history, so...

04:37.506 --> 04:39.375
Great. Thanks.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.178
What does that thing do?

04:41.912 --> 04:43.446
Looks like
a potato peeler.

04:43.482 --> 04:45.918
Yeah. Oh, that is nasty. Oh.

04:46.388 --> 04:48.124
And illegal in 12 states.

04:48.658 --> 04:50.895
Yeah, you're right.
That is weird.

04:50.930 --> 04:52.899
Okay. Thank you.
What's weird?

04:52.933 --> 04:54.136
Lanie ran a sart kit.

04:54.171 --> 04:56.607
There's no signs of
sexual assault or activity.

04:56.642 --> 04:59.478
This has all the makings
of a sex crime,

04:59.512 --> 05:00.884
but there's no sex involved.

05:00.885 --> 05:03.085
Well, maybe our psychopath
believes in abstinence.

05:03.518 --> 05:05.421
It's more likely he has
a performance problem.

05:05.455 --> 05:06.690
And there's no I.D.

05:06.724 --> 05:07.927
Her fingerprints
aren't in the system.

05:07.928 --> 05:09.928
Oh!

05:10.062 --> 05:13.333
No, no, no, no, no.
How do you even
get in that position?

05:13.367 --> 05:14.504
I don't know, but you should
try that with your,

05:15.438 --> 05:16.175
uh, girlfriend, honey milk.
As a matter of fact,

05:16.210 --> 05:17.580
I think I'm gonna buy this
for you right now.

05:17.581 --> 05:20.581
Oh, jeez. How do you even
get in that position?

05:20.614 --> 05:21.816
Right?
It's not even possible.

05:21.817 --> 05:22.717
<i>all fours. Now.</i>

05:22.751 --> 05:24.054
Oh, it's possible.

05:24.789 --> 05:25.727
Anything on the canvass?

05:26.528 --> 05:27.628
Nothing yet.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.797
And nothing back
from missing persons.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.367
Given that it just happened
last night,

05:31.402 --> 05:33.840
It's most likely not gonna be
reported for a couple of days.

05:34.241 --> 05:35.241
What about the cuffs?

05:35.274 --> 05:37.644
We found seven shops
in Manhattan

05:37.678 --> 05:39.348
that make
custom bondage gear.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.685
And while we're waiting
to hear back,

05:40.686 --> 05:43.289
we're gonna buy a gift
for Ryan's imaginary girlfriend.

05:43.323 --> 05:45.960
Ooh, yeah. When are we
gonna meet that Jenny?

05:45.994 --> 05:47.563
When the time is right,
I'll bring her around.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.934
I don't want you guys
scaring her off.

05:49.968 --> 05:52.571
Oh, there she is now.
Ugh. I don't know.

05:52.605 --> 05:54.241
Hello. Detective Kevin Ryan.
You guys, give him a break.

05:54.276 --> 05:56.311
I wouldn't bring my boyfriend
around here either.

05:57.179 --> 06:00.149
Boyfriend?
Did I miss something?

06:00.384 --> 06:04.023
So that was Barry
from the Love Shackle.

06:04.058 --> 06:05.927
He says the cuff
might be theirs,

06:05.961 --> 06:08.331
but he'd have to examine 'em
up close to know for sure.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.802
Well, then have evidence
pull them

06:09.836 --> 06:11.040
And tell them I'm coming.

06:11.541 --> 06:13.941
Oh, a field trip
to a sex store.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.611
I love this case.

06:17.046 --> 06:18.647
Look at him
following her.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.186
Who's whipped, huh,
me or him?

Oh, this his speed?

06:41.124 --> 06:42.460
No.

06:42.494 --> 06:44.095
But if you keep talking,
I'll put you in one of these.

06:45.129 --> 06:46.932
Hey, guys.
Looking for something special?

06:46.933 --> 06:47.933
Yes.
No.

06:48.466 --> 06:50.067
Just gettin' started, huh?

06:50.401 --> 06:51.438
Yeah, we get a lot
of first timers.

06:51.472 --> 06:54.175
We carry everything
from bondage 101

06:54.209 --> 06:56.012
all the way up to
the more advanced stuff

06:56.346 --> 06:58.682
for your pleasure Phd.

06:58.716 --> 07:00.455
But if you're just looking
to dip your toe in the water,

07:01.089 --> 07:03.492
these little guys
are best sellers.

07:04.626 --> 07:05.197
Want to give 'em a try?

07:05.198 --> 07:06.198
No, thanks.

07:06.931 --> 07:08.468
I've already got a pair
of my own.

07:12.506 --> 07:15.911
Double cross lap stitch
on the seam.

07:15.945 --> 07:17.915
Yeah, this is definitely
one of mine.

07:17.949 --> 07:19.885
Can you tell us
who ordered them?

07:19.919 --> 07:20.787
Yeah,
I remember this kid.

07:20.822 --> 07:22.190
Very vanilla.

07:22.225 --> 07:23.860
Then again, it's always
the normal-looking ones

07:23.894 --> 07:25.134
that end up being
the most freaky, right?

07:25.135 --> 07:27.235
Do you have a name
or a billing address?

07:27.268 --> 07:29.904
Yeah. The cuffs were purchased
six months ago

07:30.039 --> 07:31.440
by a Tyler Benton.

07:31.474 --> 07:34.312
He had 'em specially made for
his girlfriend. Cute girl, too.

07:34.347 --> 07:37.618
You remember her?
Yeah, brunette, mid-20s,

07:37.752 --> 07:38.755
asked a lot of questions.

07:38.789 --> 07:41.393
Did she by any chance
look like this?

07:42.827 --> 07:43.896
Oh, my god.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.397
We need to talk
to Tyler Benton

07:45.430 --> 07:47.301
and find out
what he was doing last night.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.738

is killing his girlfriend.

Where were you last night,

At the hospital.
I'm a first year.

You can ask my attending.

You guys like to play?
What?

08:28.618 --> 08:30.452
No.
We never even used them.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.385
They were--they were just
supposed to be a joke

08:32.419 --> 08:33.554
because of her research.

08:33.955 --> 08:34.955
Research?

08:35.289 --> 08:37.589
I tried to be supportive,
but I should've stopped her.

08:37.623 --> 08:38.924
I should've pushed her
to study something else.

08:38.924 --> 08:40.225
What was she studying?

08:43.393 --> 08:46.161
The sociology of sexual bondage
and domination.

08:47.395 --> 08:49.396
She spent months
meeting people in that world,

08:49.430 --> 08:50.964
trying to understand
what made them tick.

08:53.198 --> 08:55.232
And they killed her for it.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.168
And where did you keep
these cuffs?

08:59.203 --> 09:01.370
I don't--I don't know.

09:01.405 --> 09:03.672
At her place, I guess.
Her roommate probably knows.

09:03.706 --> 09:05.807
The two of them were, like,
attached at the hip.

09:06.442 --> 09:08.809
Jessica and I

09:08.843 --> 09:10.380
have been roommates
since freshman year.

09:10.414 --> 09:14.019
We've lived together so long,
we're practically sisters.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.521
Tyler said
that you might know

09:15.556 --> 09:17.557
where she kept the cuffs
he gave her.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.559
Oh, she showed them to me
when she got them,

09:20.593 --> 09:22.761
but I never saw them
after that.

09:22.795 --> 09:25.030
And when was the last time
that you saw Jessica?

09:26.365 --> 09:27.698
Yesterday morning.

09:28.333 --> 09:29.400
What about her research?

09:29.434 --> 09:31.468
Did she ever talk to you
about where she went,

09:31.503 --> 09:33.136
Uh, the people involved?

09:33.471 --> 09:35.905
No, she pretty much kept
all that to herself.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.739
Detective Beckett.

09:38.774 --> 09:40.508
Excuse me.

09:46.812 --> 09:49.246
So the bed hasn't been slept in.
There's no signs of a struggle.

09:49.281 --> 09:51.915
Cell phone, purse?
Nada.

09:51.949 --> 09:52.883
Which means
she was somewhere else

09:52.917 --> 09:53.918
where she was killed.

09:54.652 --> 09:56.453
Okay, let's put a trace
on her cell phone.

09:56.987 --> 10:00.055
If she has a gps locator,
we might get lucky
all right.

10:01.690 --> 10:03.156
Did Jessica ever mention

10:03.191 --> 10:04.391
where she was going to be
last night?

10:04.425 --> 10:07.092
No. I-I got in
at around 10:00.

10:07.126 --> 10:09.227
It didn't look like
she had been home.

10:09.262 --> 10:11.730
Since Tyler was on call,
I...

10:11.764 --> 10:14.532
I assumed she was
up at the university

10:14.566 --> 10:16.433
working on her thesis.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.569
I wish I could
help you, Detective.

10:18.603 --> 10:20.304
sometimes she'd work late,
but she wasn't here last night.

10:20.339 --> 10:21.506
Are you sure about that?

10:21.507 --> 10:23.007
I was here till 11:00
grading papers.

10:23.140 --> 10:23.775
I would've seen her.

10:23.776 --> 10:25.676
As her advisor,
how much would you know

10:25.709 --> 10:27.410
about the people
that she was researching?

10:27.411 --> 10:29.111
She was spending a lot of time
with a dominatrix

10:29.178 --> 10:30.012
named Mistress Venom.

10:30.313 --> 10:31.513
Mistress Venom?

10:32.246 --> 10:34.481
Sounds more like
"Penthouse Forum" than Phd.

10:34.482 --> 10:37.182
Mr. Castle, people who study
sex-related fields

10:37.215 --> 10:38.882
are often derided
within academia.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.785
Jessica was determined
not to be held hostage

10:40.819 --> 10:42.219
by their little minds.

10:42.653 --> 10:44.621
Venom was Jessica's guide
to that world.

10:44.655 --> 10:47.056
If you want to know more about
the people Jessica was studying,

10:47.091 --> 10:47.925
You'll have to ask Venom.

10:47.959 --> 10:50.893
Kelly, this is Detective Beckett

10:50.928 --> 10:52.828
and Richard Castle.

10:52.863 --> 10:55.398
They need to see
Jessica's research.

10:55.432 --> 10:56.733
She kept her notes
locked up?

10:56.734 --> 10:58.834
She was a finalist
for the Kellerman fellowship.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.202
You know,

11:00.236 --> 11:01.573
when you're competing against
other people in the department,

11:01.609 --> 11:04.010
the last thing you want to do is
leave your notes lying around.

11:04.045 --> 11:05.644
Well, it looks like
a lot of late nights.

11:05.645 --> 11:06.945
When Tyler was on shift,

11:07.079 --> 11:09.247
she'd just pull an all-nighter
and go visit him on his breaks.

11:09.248 --> 11:10.748
Kelly, did you hear
how they found her?

11:10.982 --> 11:11.715
Matt--

11:11.716 --> 11:13.316
Tied to the monkey bars
on a playground

11:13.350 --> 11:14.316
in her underwear?

11:14.317 --> 11:16.017
Matt, um,
this is Detective Beckett.

11:16.351 --> 11:18.652
She's here investigating
Jessica's death.

11:18.686 --> 11:20.487
Matt, Jess and I
all started the Phd program

11:20.522 --> 11:21.422
at the same time.

11:21.523 --> 11:22.823
I can tell you were close.

11:23.457 --> 11:24.459
I'm sorry. It's just--

11:24.460 --> 11:26.760
Kelly, did Jessica have
any enemies in the department?

11:27.593 --> 11:29.793
Anyone in school that she
didn't get along with?

11:29.794 --> 11:31.462
Just because we were competing
for the same fellowship

11:31.496 --> 11:32.897
doesn't mean
that we weren'civil.

11:32.898 --> 11:35.198
Not everyone was civil.
In the last few weeks,

11:35.232 --> 11:37.833
Jessica was getting these
phone calls on her office line.

11:37.967 --> 11:38.968
What kind of calls?

11:39.002 --> 11:41.303
Um, heavy breathing,
moaning.

11:41.337 --> 11:43.172
Made you want to take
a hand sanitizer shower.

11:43.206 --> 11:45.274
Seems a little immature
for grad students.

11:45.275 --> 11:46.575
Look, I'm studying the impact

11:46.608 --> 11:48.809
of A.I.D.S. treatments
in inner-city clinics.

11:48.943 --> 11:51.112
Kelly's is about overcoming
the glass ceiling.

11:51.146 --> 11:54.147
And Jessica was watching
a dominatrix

11:54.182 --> 11:57.549
dig her stiletto
into some loser's chest.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.220
She was bound to get
some grief for it.

11:59.221 --> 12:00.221
ah.

12:05.824 --> 12:08.658
Jessica's notes on Venom's sessions
are pretty detailed.

12:08.693 --> 12:10.160
She studied these guys
like lab rats.

12:10.195 --> 12:12.730
But she only identifies them
by nickname--"ladyboy,"

12:12.764 --> 12:15.464
"pin cushion"
and "scared bunny."

12:15.799 --> 12:18.334
You know, if they didn't know
what Jessica was doing,

12:18.368 --> 12:20.305
and one of them found out...

12:20.339 --> 12:23.008
Fear of exposure would be
a strong motive to kill.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.544
I wonder what attracted her
to all this.

12:24.545 --> 12:26.245
Well, according to
her thesis proposal,

12:26.278 --> 12:28.579
she became interested in s&m
after witnessing

12:28.613 --> 12:30.448
a dysfunctional relationship
up close.

12:30.582 --> 12:31.749
Apparently her dissertation

12:31.817 --> 12:34.884
compares the overt expressions
of dominance in the dungeon

12:34.919 --> 12:38.354
to more subtle expressions
in real-world relationships...

12:38.989 --> 12:40.389
Like who drives.

12:40.423 --> 12:43.124
Hey, I would drive
if you would let me.

12:43.158 --> 12:45.794
That actually didn't prove my
point like I thought it would.

12:45.828 --> 12:48.362
You know, it says here
that Mistress Venom

12:48.396 --> 12:51.264
works in a bondage club
somewhere in Dungeon Alley,

12:51.299 --> 12:52.432
but it doesn't say
which one.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.634
Dungeon Alley.

12:54.868 --> 12:57.102
It's an area between
Chelsea and Midtown.

12:57.137 --> 12:59.104
There's a whole slew
of fetish clubs there.

12:59.339 --> 13:01.573
Yes, I know
where Dungeon Alley is.

13:01.607 --> 13:04.108
I want to know...
How do you know?

13:06.478 --> 13:08.378
Vice raided a few of them

13:08.412 --> 13:10.313
looking for a reason
to shut them down.

13:10.347 --> 13:11.881
But since
there's no sexual contact

13:11.916 --> 13:15.785
and the acts are all consensual,
it was a perfectly legal.

13:15.819 --> 13:18.920
Hmm. You know,
you should moonlight.

13:18.954 --> 13:22.523
Seriously, you would make
<i>a fortune.</i>

13:22.557 --> 13:24.925
Come on. Haven't you ever
wanted to do...

13:24.959 --> 13:29.929
something with your handcuffs
other than arrest criminals?

13:29.964 --> 13:31.898
No.

13:31.932 --> 13:33.233
But there is one hot...

13:34.168 --> 13:35.768
wild...

13:36.202 --> 13:38.870
kinky thing
that I do like doing.

13:40.072 --> 13:42.508
Putting killers
behind bars.

13:44.042 --> 13:46.844
See? You're already a tease.
You're halfway there.

13:46.878 --> 13:49.379
Hey, we tried to trace
the creepy calls

13:49.414 --> 13:51.114
that Jessica was getting
at her office.

13:51.149 --> 13:52.182
But since they were routed

13:52.216 --> 13:53.718
through the main switchboard
at the college,

13:53.752 --> 13:55.253
there's no way
to determine their source.

13:55.254 --> 13:56.454
What about the cell phone?

13:56.587 --> 13:57.454
The day she died,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.322
she placed a call to her
boyfriend at the hospital,

13:59.357 --> 14:01.191
she placed a call to
her voice mail at the office,

14:01.226 --> 14:04.428
and she placed two calls
to Lady Irena's House of Pain.

14:04.429 --> 14:06.229
Lady Irena's House of Pain?

14:06.262 --> 14:07.563
That must be where
Mistress Venom works.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.331
Did you get an address?

14:08.332 --> 14:09.732
Yeah, an office building
on 38th.

14:09.866 --> 14:12.201
Oh, conveniently located for all
your lunchtime spanking needs.

14:12.202 --> 14:15.002
All right you guys
look through her notes,

14:15.235 --> 14:17.002
see if there's anything
that's there

14:17.036 --> 14:18.570
that might implicate
one of her clients.

14:18.604 --> 14:20.939
meanwhile, Castle and I will go
and meet this Mistress Venom.

14:21.673 --> 14:25.174
Whips, women and murder--
sounds like my lucky day.

14:25.209 --> 14:28.711
I'm so glad
you're excited by this.
Whoo.

14:28.745 --> 14:30.679
Hi, my name is Kate,

14:30.713 --> 14:34.449
and my boyfriend has been
a very bad boy.

14:34.483 --> 14:35.251
Yes, that's right.

14:35.685 --> 14:36.220
His name's Ricky.

14:37.721 --> 14:38.421
What are you doing?

14:38.654 --> 14:41.389
Actually, a friend of mine
recommended a Mistress Venom.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.857
Wait.
Is she available today?

14:42.858 --> 14:43.758
4:00 pm?
You know what?

14:43.792 --> 14:46.027
Sure, that's perfect.
Thank you.

14:46.061 --> 14:48.330
Okay, that's
very funny. Now call her back.

14:48.331 --> 14:49.131
Unh-unh, Castle.

14:49.164 --> 14:51.899
This is the perfect way to get
Venom without tipping our hand.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.501
What's the matter, Castle?

14:55.935 --> 14:58.136
You afraid
of a little role play?

15:03.707 --> 15:06.210
Yeah, you better run.

15:07.913 --> 15:11.248
welcome to
Irena's House of Pain.

15:13.919 --> 15:15.187
This place looks like
a law firm.

15:15.188 --> 15:16.088
What'd you think
it was gonna be,

15:16.122 --> 15:17.723
torture wheels
and women in corsets?

15:17.724 --> 15:18.624
Well, yeah.

15:18.657 --> 15:19.691
That's in the back.

15:19.725 --> 15:21.726
Welcome to Lady Irena's
House of Pain.

15:22.194 --> 15:23.528
How can I serve you?

15:25.162 --> 15:26.562
Well, answer her!

15:28.197 --> 15:29.598
You see
what I have to deal with?

15:29.632 --> 15:31.566
My boyfriend Ricky has
an appointment at 4:00 pm

15:31.601 --> 15:33.134
with Mistress Venom.

15:33.268 --> 15:34.436
Will you be joining him?

15:34.470 --> 15:38.772
Oh, yes. I've been dying
to watch him squirm.

15:38.806 --> 15:40.907
Mistress Venom would be
delighted to have an audience.

15:40.942 --> 15:42.675
Follow me, please.

Mistress Venom is unavailable.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.874
But I'm Lady Irena.
I own this dungeon.

16:23.908 --> 16:27.043
I'm sure we can find another
dominatrix to suit your needs.

16:27.077 --> 16:29.445
I'm afraid we can't.
I'm Detective Beckett.

16:29.479 --> 16:31.013
I need to speak with her
right now

16:31.047 --> 16:32.515
concerning
a murder investigation.

16:34.049 --> 16:35.483
Who was murdered?

16:35.518 --> 16:36.984
Jessica Margolis.

16:37.019 --> 16:39.454
The Phd student who was
observing her sessions.

16:40.488 --> 16:41.955
There was no one
observing her sessions.

16:42.190 --> 16:43.423
Are you sure?

16:43.558 --> 16:46.292
Positive. Privacy is
paramount in my dungeon.

16:48.528 --> 16:50.296
You've never seen
this girl?

16:54.165 --> 16:55.734
Of course I've seen
that girl.

16:56.368 --> 16:58.103
She wasn't observing
Mistress Venom.

16:58.537 --> 17:00.371
She was Mistress Venom.

17:06.917 --> 17:09.252
Well, this explains
the marks on her body.

17:09.286 --> 17:11.121
Jessica must have been
wearing this before she died.

17:11.122 --> 17:12.122
Like cruel shoes,

17:11.755 --> 17:15.055
these outfits can leave marks
for hours after you wear them.

17:15.522 --> 17:17.959
She had three sessions yesterday.
She left around 7:30.

17:17.993 --> 17:21.263
You really had no idea
that Jessica was conducting

17:21.298 --> 17:23.166
A sociological experiment
out of your dungeon?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.167
No.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.769
She came to me
about six months ago.

17:26.803 --> 17:28.738
Quickly became one of
my most requested doms.

17:28.773 --> 17:30.207
Did Jessica have any clients

17:30.241 --> 17:32.742
who were unusually obsessed
with her?

17:32.777 --> 17:35.012
of course.
I mean, they all were.

17:35.046 --> 17:37.013
But her clients
were submissive.

17:37.948 --> 17:39.782
Killing
is an act of dominance.

17:39.816 --> 17:42.217
You and I both know
that people aren't that simple.

17:42.552 --> 17:44.552
Men might come here
for humiliation and torture,

17:44.587 --> 17:46.087
but it's easy to imagine
that one of them

17:46.121 --> 17:48.856
might have been pushed too far
and lashed out.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.258
If she was concerned for her
safety, she would've told me.

17:51.292 --> 17:52.760
Do you have a list
of Jessica's clients?

17:52.761 --> 17:54.761
Detective...

17:54.794 --> 17:56.761
All of the services
that we provide here

17:56.796 --> 17:58.229
are perfectly legal.

17:58.264 --> 18:00.331
Now part of that service

18:00.366 --> 18:02.767
is protecting the privacy
of our client.

18:03.202 --> 18:05.871
I'm not about to betray
the trust that they've paid for

18:06.105 --> 18:08.239
because you have a hunch.

18:08.274 --> 18:11.042
Oh, I think it's more than just a hunch.
Well, gee, I'm sorry.

18:11.077 --> 18:14.012
Unless you have a court order,
my hands are tied, so to speak.

18:14.046 --> 18:16.447
You're pretty well-versed
in law for a dominatrix.

18:16.482 --> 18:18.316
Don't let the leather
fool you.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.252
I used to be a partner
at a law firm.
Wow.

18:20.386 --> 18:21.986
When you dominate
and manipulate men

18:22.021 --> 18:23.455
in every boardroom
and courtroom that you're in,

18:23.489 --> 18:25.923
This just seemed like
the natural progression.

18:31.794 --> 18:34.030
It's called Mistress Red.

18:34.064 --> 18:36.167
Excuse me?

18:36.201 --> 18:37.702
My lipstick.

18:37.736 --> 18:41.105
I noticed
you couldn't stop staring.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.273
Sorry.
It was just hypnotic.

18:46.307 --> 18:48.274
It's not you.
It's her.

18:48.309 --> 18:50.243
Well, if you're so upset,

18:50.278 --> 18:51.579
we could find someone
for you to go medieval on,

18:52.313 --> 18:54.413
Like, uh, him perhaps.

18:55.847 --> 18:57.848
She wants to protect
her clients?

18:57.883 --> 18:59.150
What about her girls?

18:59.284 --> 19:01.785
Hey. You the cop?

19:02.119 --> 19:03.019
I'm Detective Beckett.

19:03.053 --> 19:05.554
I'm Mistress Sapphire.
So it's true?

19:05.588 --> 19:07.088
She's dead?

19:07.122 --> 19:09.390
Yes. I'm sorry--

19:09.391 --> 19:10.691
This weird thing
happened last week

19:10.725 --> 19:11.925
I think
you should know about.

19:11.926 --> 19:13.026
With one of her clients?

19:13.459 --> 19:15.463
Sort of.
A first-time client came in

19:15.498 --> 19:18.033
for a session, but he left
just after a few minutes.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.033
I found her
in the locker room, crying.

19:20.434 --> 19:21.534
Did she tell you why?

19:21.568 --> 19:22.502
No.

19:22.503 --> 19:24.703
This client, do you remember
anything about him?

19:24.836 --> 19:27.137
It was a week ago, and I only
saw him from behind.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.806
But he was wearing
one of those medical shirts.

19:29.807 --> 19:31.007
Scrubs?
Yes.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.274
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:32.308 --> 19:34.709
Jessica's boyfriend discovered
her secret identity.

19:34.844 --> 19:37.545
And instead of proposing
to her, he kills her.

19:37.579 --> 19:40.113
Jessica was the love
of my life.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.016
Why would I want to hurt her?

19:42.017 --> 19:43.317
Because she hurt you.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.017
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.818
You said so yourself.
You wanted her to stop.

19:47.852 --> 19:50.052
You were gonna make her study
something else.

19:50.087 --> 19:51.421
It must have been
a real shocker

19:51.455 --> 19:53.722
when you realized she wasn't
just studying that world,

19:54.757 --> 19:56.590
She was living it.

19:58.825 --> 20:00.692
What the hell is this?

20:00.726 --> 20:04.561
This is crazy. You're telling me
this is real?

20:04.596 --> 20:06.097
You're telling me
Jessica was one of them?

20:06.098 --> 20:07.698
Why did you go
to the dungeon last week?

20:07.731 --> 20:09.664
Was it to confront her?
The dungeon?

20:09.699 --> 20:11.034
We have a witness
who saw you there.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.135
It's completely
understandable.

20:13.769 --> 20:15.702
The woman that you loved
lied to you?

20:15.737 --> 20:17.171
I could see
how you could lose control

20:17.205 --> 20:19.106
and go into a jealous rage.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.673
And then in a panic,

20:20.708 --> 20:23.041
decide to stage the body
in a manner so unusual,

20:23.076 --> 20:26.010
we'd naturally assume it was
someone in the bondage world.

20:26.045 --> 20:27.612
I never went to a dungeon.

20:27.646 --> 20:29.955
There was no jealous rage
because I didn't know!

20:31.189 --> 20:32.856
I was going to marry her.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.658
We just signed a lease
to move in together

20:36.693 --> 20:38.093
three days ago.

20:39.127 --> 20:41.661
If I was so angry with her,
why would I do that?

20:47.132 --> 20:48.900
He was telling
the truth about the lease.

20:48.934 --> 20:50.934
not only did he and Jessica
sign the lease,

20:50.969 --> 20:52.303
but it was also notarized.

20:52.304 --> 20:53.404
That doesn't mean
he didn't do it.

20:53.437 --> 20:55.138
He coulda had her sign
to help his alibi.

20:55.272 --> 20:56.972
Maybe she was afraid
of him.

20:57.807 --> 20:59.941
I've been thinking--
the dysfunctional relationship

20:59.975 --> 21:01.042
she refers to
in her research--

21:01.176 --> 21:03.510
There's a passage where
she describes subject "a"

21:03.545 --> 21:06.079
as being afraid to tell
subject "b" that she's leaving

21:06.113 --> 21:08.314
because he's become
dangerously codependent.

21:08.348 --> 21:10.450
What if
she was describing Tyler?

21:10.451 --> 21:12.051
Maybe that's why she became
a dominatrix,

21:12.185 --> 21:13.652
to give her the courage
to stand up for herself.

21:13.687 --> 21:15.920
We have uniforms combing through
hospital security footage.

21:15.955 --> 21:17.355
If Tyler left
at any point that night,

21:17.389 --> 21:18.357
There should be some trace.

21:18.358 --> 21:20.158
In the meantime, let's just keep
digging through those notebooks.

21:20.391 --> 21:21.725
We're gonna need
more than speculation

21:21.760 --> 21:22.994
if we want to file charges.
Great.

21:27.029 --> 21:30.097
<i>♪</i>

21:37.503 --> 21:40.037
<i>♪</i>

21:41.506 --> 21:43.440
<i>♪</i>

21:43.474 --> 21:45.075
Dad!

21:46.877 --> 21:48.778
Do we need
to talk about this?

21:48.812 --> 21:50.746
This is research
for a case.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.014
Oh.

21:52.048 --> 21:53.683
And we need to get you
some noisier shoes.

21:53.717 --> 21:56.019
Seriously, I--
hey, you made the team.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.720
No. Tryouts aren't
for another month,

21:57.753 --> 21:59.520
but Ashley let me take
her uniform home

21:59.555 --> 22:00.322
to see how it fit.

22:00.323 --> 22:01.623
And what do you think?

22:02.257 --> 22:04.657
I think
it's totally not me,

22:04.691 --> 22:06.725
which is why
I kind of like it.

22:08.259 --> 22:09.727
It's not you,
so you like it?

22:10.228 --> 22:11.528
Yeah.

22:12.562 --> 22:14.295
You know how in "Storm Fall,"

22:14.329 --> 22:16.797
you killed off Derrick Storm
because you were bored with him?

22:16.831 --> 22:19.198
Yeah.
Sometimes I  feel that way about me,

22:19.232 --> 22:20.766
like I'm hiding inside
my comfort zone.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.567
And maybe it's time
to venture out a little.

22:23.102 --> 22:27.003
Well, does that venture
have to include pom-poms?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.404
I don't want to look back
on high school

22:28.439 --> 22:30.239
and feel like
I missed out on something.

22:30.273 --> 22:33.874
So promise
you'll be supportive.

22:35.742 --> 22:37.510
Yeah, I, uh...

22:37.544 --> 22:39.411
I promise.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.748
Go, dad!

22:42.782 --> 22:44.550
Whoo!

22:44.585 --> 22:46.052
Move, move, move.
Get out of the way.

22:46.086 --> 22:48.854
'cause the bears are comin',
and we're ready to play.

22:48.888 --> 22:50.489
Go, bears!

22:52.692 --> 22:54.660
You ever want
to be a cheerleader?

22:54.694 --> 22:56.628
No. Did you?

22:56.663 --> 22:59.697
Not me. Alexis.

22:59.731 --> 23:00.800
She wants to try out for the team.

23:01.401 --> 23:02.601
So?
So?

23:02.634 --> 23:03.868
You see what they wear?

23:03.902 --> 23:06.572
She wants to join a team,
why not join mathletes?

23:06.573 --> 23:07.973
Why can't she do both?

23:08.307 --> 23:11.074
Besides,
kids try on personalities

23:11.109 --> 23:13.009
the way they try on clothes.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.945
It's the way that they
figure out who they are.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.483
What are you looking for?

23:19.517 --> 23:22.153
According to
the security footage,

23:22.187 --> 23:25.055
the boyfriend never left
the hospital during his shift.

23:25.090 --> 23:27.992
It wasn't him.
Maybe he faked the footage.

23:28.026 --> 23:30.294
He's an intern,
not Jason Bourne.

23:30.329 --> 23:33.598
Oh. Well, there goes
my subject "b" theory.

23:33.632 --> 23:35.533
So Jessica left the dungeon
at 7:30,

23:35.567 --> 23:39.136
and she was killed sometime
between 10:00 and 11:00.

23:39.470 --> 23:41.638
If she didn't go home
or to the university,

23:41.672 --> 23:43.772
then where did she go?

23:43.907 --> 23:45.074
Beckett.

23:45.109 --> 23:47.511
Something in here
you gotta see.

23:47.546 --> 23:50.615
It's one of
Jessica's subjects.

23:50.649 --> 23:52.250
She calls him "sam-I-am."

23:52.284 --> 23:53.453
Because he has
a Dr. Seuss fetish?

23:53.487 --> 23:56.922
Because he's a sam--
"a smart-assed masochist."

23:57.356 --> 23:58.256
According to her notes,

23:58.290 --> 24:00.157
a sam pretends
he wants to be submissive,

24:00.192 --> 24:02.392
but what he actually wants to do
is dominate his Mistress,

24:02.327 --> 24:03.628
usually with
passive-aggression.

24:03.629 --> 24:04.729
Instead of asking
for what he wants,

24:04.762 --> 24:07.097
he makes a game out of
making other people upset

24:07.131 --> 24:08.099
so they can be punished.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.900
Really?
There's people like that?

24:10.433 --> 24:12.234
Only these sams
can be dangerous.

24:12.268 --> 24:15.203
Sometimes resorting to threats
to provoke their response.

24:15.238 --> 24:16.605
Listen to this.

24:16.639 --> 24:17.740
"he said Mistress Venom
was the one

24:17.775 --> 24:19.241
"who needed to be punished.

24:19.276 --> 24:21.677
"he said he was going to
finder, tie her up

24:21.712 --> 24:22.779
"and drown her,

24:22.847 --> 24:26.948
but in something... sweet,
like caramel."

24:27.149 --> 24:27.849
Sexual obsession

24:27.883 --> 24:29.084
and a description
of the crime scene.

24:29.118 --> 24:30.352
Sounds like our guy to me.

24:30.353 --> 24:31.853
yeah,
but we only got a nickname.

24:32.087 --> 24:33.655
We have more than a nickname.
We have enough

24:33.689 --> 24:35.557
to force Lady Irena
to turn over her client list.

24:35.858 --> 24:36.858
Judge Markway, please.

24:38.292 --> 24:40.460
Ooh. Sounds like someone's
gonna get punished.

24:44.937 --> 24:47.371
William Caraway,
aka "sam-I-am."

24:47.405 --> 24:49.339
Senior vice president
at Stewart, Cabot and Sagansky.

24:49.373 --> 24:51.440
The global consulting firm?
Mm-hmm.

24:51.475 --> 24:53.809
No wonder Lady Irena
was protecting his identity.

24:53.843 --> 24:56.144
Castle, why don't you
sit this one out?

24:56.178 --> 24:58.713
I think Mr. Caraway will
respond better to a strong...

24:58.747 --> 25:01.381
female hand.

25:03.851 --> 25:06.719
Sam-I-am... in a box...

25:06.753 --> 25:09.622
with a fox--
we're gonna need some popcorn.

25:09.656 --> 25:11.023
Sit.

25:11.057 --> 25:13.492
First why don't you tell me
why the hell I'm here?

25:13.526 --> 25:14.959
I got a board meeting--

25:14.994 --> 25:17.528
I said sit down... now.

25:22.398 --> 25:24.232
Good boy.

25:24.266 --> 25:25.602
Your Mistress would be
very proud of you.

25:26.636 --> 25:27.403
Excuse me?

25:27.438 --> 25:28.638
Mistress Venom.

25:29.673 --> 25:31.941
Lady Irena's House of Pain.

25:32.176 --> 25:34.345
You like to be tied up,
you like to be spanked,

25:34.479 --> 25:37.147
But more than anything,
you like to make threats.

25:37.648 --> 25:39.148
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:40.916 --> 25:43.252
There is no
dominatrix-client privilege

25:43.286 --> 25:44.286
In New York.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.886
And your Mistress
was very thorough

25:46.920 --> 25:49.521
in documenting your deepest,
darkest desires--

25:50.255 --> 25:51.621
The thing with the matches,

25:52.155 --> 25:53.155
How you liked it messy.

25:53.156 --> 25:54.356
She wrote that down?

25:54.389 --> 25:57.423
She also wrote how you wanted
to turn the tables on her,

25:57.457 --> 26:00.892
how you threatened to tie her up
and drown her in caramel.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.127
I-it's fantasy.

26:02.262 --> 26:03.495
But the fantasies
weren't enough.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.832
And so you had to make
your dreams come true.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.801
No, that's not possible.

26:11.835 --> 26:15.368
The more she said no,
the more you became obsessed.

26:15.803 --> 26:17.470
You didn't want to be
the submissive.

26:17.506 --> 26:18.973
You wanted to dominate her,

26:19.008 --> 26:21.308
and the ultimate domination
is murder.

26:21.342 --> 26:23.144
No, I swear. I didn't
even know she was dead.

26:23.145 --> 26:24.845
You were very specific
in your threats,

26:24.879 --> 26:26.046
and that's exactly
how we found her.

26:26.181 --> 26:27.915
Do you really expect me to
believe that that wasn't you?

26:29.050 --> 26:29.750
Well--well, someone
must have found out.

26:29.785 --> 26:30.885
Someone could've read
her notes.

26:31.619 --> 26:33.553
Where were you
two nights ago?

26:36.588 --> 26:37.590
Mr. Caraway,
where were you?

26:41.559 --> 26:42.361
I was with my wife.

26:44.695 --> 26:46.162
It was our anniversary.

26:46.196 --> 26:47.796
His wife confirms it.

26:47.831 --> 26:49.898
He was with her at the
anniversary party all night.

26:49.933 --> 26:52.300
This staging
was way too specific

26:52.335 --> 26:54.369
to be just a coincidence.
Somebody knew.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.471
Maybe she told someone.

26:55.972 --> 26:57.672
Maybe someone had access
to the research.

26:58.006 --> 26:59.506
Filing cabinet's not
Fort Knox.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.841
Anyone with access would've read
exactly what we read

27:01.876 --> 27:04.544
and could use it
to throw us off their trail.

27:04.578 --> 27:07.346
Okay. You and Ryan
go back to the dungeon.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.381
See if any of the girls
swap stories after work.

27:09.416 --> 27:11.384
Meanwhile, Castle and I
will go to the university

27:11.418 --> 27:14.152
and see who had access
to her research.

27:15.187 --> 27:17.154
Okay.

27:17.188 --> 27:19.122
♪ when I walk ♪

27:19.156 --> 27:20.756
♪ I walk right on ♪

27:20.791 --> 27:22.257
♪ when I move... ♪

27:22.292 --> 27:24.759
No, Mistress Venom
never mentioned him to me,

27:24.794 --> 27:26.961
or any of her other clients.

27:26.995 --> 27:29.696
Really? Come on.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.599
You girls
don't share shop talk?

27:32.633 --> 27:35.401
You work here long enough,

27:35.436 --> 27:38.938
and the kinkiest things
you could ever imagine...

27:38.972 --> 27:41.407
are just another day
at the office.

27:41.441 --> 27:44.341
The only time we trade info
is if we share clients,

27:44.376 --> 27:46.475
but Mistress Venom
didn't share.

27:46.508 --> 27:48.042
Do you mind
unstrapping my boot?

27:51.344 --> 27:53.278
Uh, thank you,
Mistress Amber?

27:53.313 --> 27:55.680
Yes.
Mistress Scorpion?

27:55.714 --> 27:58.348
Okay, I get 'em confused.
I'm sorry.

27:58.383 --> 28:00.885
Okay.
Did she have any clients
that might have been,

28:00.919 --> 28:02.319
uh, acting suspicious?

28:02.354 --> 28:04.287
faster.

28:04.321 --> 28:06.255
Is, uh,
is there a possibility

28:06.289 --> 28:08.656
that she may have mentioned
one client's fetishes

28:08.691 --> 28:10.359
to another client?
Absolutely not.

28:10.394 --> 28:13.296
Lady Irena beats confidentiality
rules into our heads.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.566
Mistress Venom wasn't stupid.

28:16.568 --> 28:18.168
Is there a problem?

28:18.202 --> 28:20.436
Just this knot.
It's like an octagonal knot.

28:20.470 --> 28:22.371
It's got, like, eight sides.
I've never seen a knot like--

28:22.439 --> 28:24.307
Detective Esposito
bringing crime to its knees.

28:25.008 --> 28:25.808
Sit.

28:25.842 --> 28:28.478
So none of the girls claim
that they remember Jessica

28:28.512 --> 28:30.246
talking about
any of her clients.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.081
But I think we might have
an explanation

28:32.116 --> 28:34.284
as to where she was between
the time she left work

28:34.218 --> 28:35.519
and when she was killed.

28:35.553 --> 28:37.987
Uh, Mistress Scorpion thinks

28:38.021 --> 28:39.988
that Jessica might have been
working off the books.

28:40.023 --> 28:42.524
Well, if she was,
then she was asking for trouble.

28:42.558 --> 28:44.726
Nothing upsets Lady Irena
more than some girl

28:44.760 --> 28:46.727
trying to screw her
out of her 40%.

28:48.062 --> 28:49.396
Ow

28:49.431 --> 28:51.565
Hey, Irish, you want to he out
your little buddy here?

28:51.599 --> 28:55.734
He seems to be all thumbs.

28:58.150 --> 28:59.784
You were
her office mate, Kelly.

28:59.818 --> 29:02.120
It would've been very easy
for you to access her files.

29:02.121 --> 29:03.921
No, it wouldn't.
I told you.

29:03.954 --> 29:05.388
She was very private
about her work.

29:05.922 --> 29:07.790
You mean to tell me, she didn't
once slip out to the bathroom

29:07.825 --> 29:09.459
And just leave her notes
sitting on the desk?

29:10.329 --> 29:12.196
If she did,
I wouldn't be interested

29:12.997 --> 29:14.197
and the night she was killed,

29:14.230 --> 29:15.731
I was in Westchester
with my folks.

29:15.732 --> 29:17.832
Does anyone else
have access to this office?

29:17.866 --> 29:19.866
The only other person
with a key to the office

29:19.901 --> 29:21.435
is maintenance.
What about your keys?

29:21.469 --> 29:23.671
Did you ever lose them
or lend them to a friend?
No.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.572
I mean, I gave them
to Matt last week

29:25.607 --> 29:27.341
because he said he had
some papers here.

29:29.075 --> 29:31.310
What, you think he broke in
to her filing cabinet

29:31.344 --> 29:32.278
and took her research?

29:32.279 --> 29:33.979
That is exactly
what I'm thinking.

29:34.712 --> 29:36.946
You said it yourself. It's
a very competitive program.

29:36.981 --> 29:39.583
And they were both finalists
for the same fellowship.

29:39.617 --> 29:42.187
This is, uh, Matt's proposal
for studying

29:42.221 --> 29:43.589
the effect of A.I.D.S.
on inner-city clinics.

29:43.623 --> 29:46.925
Look at the picture.
He's in scrubs.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.960
It wasn't Tyler who confronted
Jessica at the dungeon.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.461
It was Matt.

29:50.794 --> 29:53.896
I borrowed Kelly's keys.
That doesn't prove anything.

29:53.930 --> 29:57.832
Which is why we took a look
at the whole picture.

29:57.867 --> 29:59.967
This is a list of phone calls

30:00.002 --> 30:02.135
made from your cell phone
to the university switchboard.

30:02.170 --> 30:05.171
Each one coincides with
a harassing call to Jessica.

30:05.205 --> 30:06.406
You made those calls.

30:06.441 --> 30:07.909
Look, it was a joke.

30:07.910 --> 30:09.910
How about
your little visit to Jessica

30:10.043 --> 30:11.177
at the dungeon last week?

30:11.211 --> 30:12.113
Was that a joke as well?

30:12.114 --> 30:13.814
She didn't tell anybody
where the dungeon was.

30:13.848 --> 30:15.082
So how'd you find it?

30:15.116 --> 30:17.183
Did you follow her
or the clues in her research?

30:17.218 --> 30:19.052
You were her rival
for a fellowship.

30:19.086 --> 30:20.987
You needed her
out of the way.

30:21.422 --> 30:23.690
And when you read her research,
you saw your chance.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.591
Look, I needed
that funding, okay?

30:25.624 --> 30:28.492
My work is important.
I mean, come on. Seriously.

30:28.526 --> 30:29.994
I couldn't let her get
that fellowship.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.929
And when I saw her research,
I mean, it read like fiction.

30:32.963 --> 30:34.465
So I went to the dungeon
to find out.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.966
So you broke in
to her filing cabinet,

30:36.299 --> 30:38.033
You copied her research,

30:38.067 --> 30:40.302
and then you followed her
to the dungeon.

30:40.336 --> 30:42.270
You're not putting
a whole lot of checks

30:42.304 --> 30:44.238
in the innocent column here,
Matt.

30:44.272 --> 30:45.372
The innocent column.

30:45.406 --> 30:47.974
Listen...
I threatened her.

30:48.008 --> 30:50.276
All right?
But I did not kill her.

30:50.310 --> 30:52.944
When I found out
that she was Mistress Venom,

30:52.979 --> 30:54.879
I told her that if
she didn't withdraw

30:54.914 --> 30:57.016
her fellowship application,
I was gonna tell her boyfriend.

30:57.150 --> 30:59.151
And when that didn't work,
you killed her?

30:59.152 --> 31:00.352
It did work.

31:00.585 --> 31:03.354
Jessica withdrew her application
the day before she was killed.

31:03.388 --> 31:04.455
How do you know?

31:04.456 --> 31:05.956
Because she blind copied me
on an e-mail

31:05.990 --> 31:07.623
that she sent to
the head of the committee.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.357
We were cool.

31:09.391 --> 31:11.692
What she was most concerned
about was getting back

31:11.726 --> 31:13.593
this research that I copied.

31:13.628 --> 31:14.796
So as soon as she was
out of the running,

31:14.830 --> 31:16.498
I brought it all
back to her apartment.

31:18.199 --> 31:19.799
You know you are
morally challenged

31:19.833 --> 31:21.802
if your murder alibi
is a blackmailing scheme.

31:21.803 --> 31:22.903
Yeah, but if he's
telling the truth,

31:23.036 --> 31:24.205
then we have no motive.

31:24.906 --> 31:26.206
Well, hello, gentleman.

31:26.239 --> 31:27.640
How was your trip to the dungeon?

31:27.907 --> 31:30.676
Well, we learned that Esposito
is not very good with laces.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.045
There were a lot of laces--

31:32.046 --> 31:34.346
I-I loosened 'em for you.
Yeah, sure.

31:35.613 --> 31:36.980
None of the girls admit
to Jessica sharing

31:37.015 --> 31:39.049
any of her client secrets
with 'em.

31:39.050 --> 31:39.950
Oh, one of 'em thought

31:39.983 --> 31:42.151
that she might have been seeing
clients outside of the dungeon,

31:42.286 --> 31:43.955
which might explain
the hole in our timeline.

31:43.956 --> 31:46.256
But we ran through her phones
and financials again.

31:46.289 --> 31:48.256
We can't find
any record of it.

31:48.290 --> 31:50.058
How out you?
Hear you have a suspect.

31:50.092 --> 31:51.259
Had.

31:51.260 --> 31:52.460
Matt was telling the truth.

31:52.494 --> 31:53.828
Jessica pulled out
of the fellowship.

31:56.762 --> 31:58.297
But if he was telling the truth,
then where's all the research

31:58.331 --> 31:59.765
he brought back
to her apartment?

32:00.300 --> 32:01.766
Given her concerns
for privacy,

32:01.801 --> 32:03.668
she wouldn't
just throw it away.

32:03.702 --> 32:06.171
And we know she didn't take it
back to the university.

32:06.205 --> 32:07.505
Well,
maybe we missed something.

32:07.540 --> 32:09.207
Maybe she hid it somewhere.

32:11.041 --> 32:15.211
Or maybe Matt is lying
about the research.

32:15.245 --> 32:17.980
So you didn't see
a stack of paperwork?

32:18.014 --> 32:20.348
No, I would've noticed that.

32:20.382 --> 32:21.384
Maybe she took them
up to school?

32:21.485 --> 32:23.085
No, it wasn't there either.

32:23.418 --> 32:25.553
Are you sure
Matt's telling the truth?

32:25.587 --> 32:27.455
Most people lie
to avoid suspicion.

32:27.489 --> 32:29.390
Not a lot of people lie
to incriminate themselves.

32:29.391 --> 32:30.791
That night
that you came home,

32:30.825 --> 32:33.659
did you notice anything
different or out of place?

32:34.994 --> 32:37.629
Now that you mention it,
I did find something odd.

32:37.697 --> 32:39.864
Earlier tonight I was
emptying the dishwasher,

32:39.899 --> 32:42.867
and I found a wine glass
with lipstick on it.

32:42.901 --> 32:44.901
It didn't seem like
Jessica's shade,

32:44.936 --> 32:47.304
and it wasn't one of mine.

32:47.338 --> 32:50.373
I put it aside
to hand-wash it later.

32:51.642 --> 32:54.610
Recognize this shade?

32:55.812 --> 32:58.947
If I'm not mistaken,
and I rarely am,

32:58.981 --> 33:01.015
that's Mistress Red.

33:05.202 --> 33:08.770
Did you know that lip prints
are a lot like fingerprints?

33:08.805 --> 33:10.705
No two are exactly alike.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.807
Hmm.

33:15.309 --> 33:17.478
We found this on a wine glass

33:17.412 --> 33:19.446
in Jessica's apartment.

33:20.949 --> 33:23.783
What do you think we'll find
when we compare it to your lips?

33:24.218 --> 33:25.486
That stain could've been there
for months.

33:25.487 --> 33:26.487
But it wasn't.

33:26.620 --> 33:29.388
We checked with your...
car service.

33:29.422 --> 33:32.490
They said they dropped you off
at 9:00 pm

33:32.524 --> 33:34.327
in front of Jessica's place
the night she was killed.

33:34.328 --> 33:36.028
You were the last one
to see her alive.

33:36.161 --> 33:37.396
What happened that night?

33:37.397 --> 33:39.597
Did you find out
who she really was,

33:40.431 --> 33:41.565
That she was studying
her clients

33:41.599 --> 33:42.533
without their permission?

33:42.567 --> 33:44.068
I mean,
if word of that got out...

33:45.102 --> 33:46.669
that would've destroyed
your business.

33:46.703 --> 33:47.805
That can't
have made you happy.

33:47.906 --> 33:49.306
And you're grasping
at straws,

33:49.339 --> 33:51.140
And that
can't make you happy.

33:52.475 --> 33:53.742
Detective, at this time,

33:53.776 --> 33:55.910
I'm exercising my right
to legal counsel.

33:56.044 --> 33:58.546
I won't be answering
any further questions.

34:00.000 --> 34:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

34:16.594 --> 34:18.395
Yo!

34:18.429 --> 34:19.463
How'd it go
with Lady Irena?

34:19.498 --> 34:20.898
She's lawyering up.

34:20.931 --> 34:23.132
What'd you guys find
at Jessica's apartment?

34:23.266 --> 34:24.801
Well, it looks like
we found the crime scene.

34:24.835 --> 34:26.869
Irena was pretty good
at cleaning up after herself.

34:26.904 --> 34:28.871
There was no trace
or blood evidence,

34:28.905 --> 34:31.273
but the area around
Jessica's bedside table

34:31.306 --> 34:32.507
lit up like a Christmas tree.

34:32.541 --> 34:34.109
It'd been
scrubbed down with bleach.

34:34.143 --> 34:35.744
That's why we didn't find
Jessica's research.

34:35.777 --> 34:36.913
Irena got rid of it all.

34:36.914 --> 34:38.914
Yeah, but she didn't
quite clean everything.

34:39.047 --> 34:41.081
Once C.S.U. stripped the bed,
the swab test

34:41.114 --> 34:44.016
revealed dried saliva
in one of her pillows

34:43.150 --> 34:45.150
from her screams
as she was smothered.

34:45.186 --> 34:46.786
Looks like she'd do anything
to protect her business,

34:46.821 --> 34:47.822
even kill.

34:47.822 --> 34:49.723
All right, lawyer or not,
let's book her.

34:49.757 --> 34:51.123
Let's do it.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.328
hmm.

35:00.363 --> 35:03.098
Are you straining those noodles
or just my patience?

35:03.132 --> 35:04.332
Hmm?

35:04.366 --> 35:06.299
Oh, I'm... sorry.
just...

35:06.334 --> 35:07.767
Hmm.
This case.

35:07.802 --> 35:10.202
keep thinking
that I'm missing something.

35:10.236 --> 35:11.937
Yeah, me, too. Salt.

35:11.972 --> 35:13.839
Whoa. W-whoa. Ee. Doh.

35:13.873 --> 35:16.107
Can you die
from sodium poisoning?

35:16.142 --> 35:18.209
Ooh. You have a point.

35:18.244 --> 35:21.112
Hey, that smells good.

35:21.146 --> 35:23.214
mm.

35:23.249 --> 35:25.249
But... I already ate?

35:25.283 --> 35:27.317
Oh, no.

35:27.352 --> 35:29.553
So did you and Ashley
do cheerleading practice?

35:29.587 --> 35:32.021
Uh, no. Turns out,

35:32.055 --> 35:34.289
Cheerleading conflicts with
my fencing schedule,

35:34.323 --> 35:36.757
my violin lessons
and French Club.

35:36.792 --> 35:39.092
Cheerleading is
more of a lifestyle.

35:39.127 --> 35:41.061
and as much
as I like to visit,

35:41.095 --> 35:43.763
it's not really a place
I'd like to live.

35:43.797 --> 35:44.866
I told you
she'd figure it out.

35:45.001 --> 35:47.568
Well, we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.438
You learned that you can
expand your horizons and grow.

35:50.472 --> 35:53.507
I learned that if that involves
short skirts and boys,

35:53.541 --> 35:55.975
I'm not gonna like it.
Fair enough.

35:56.009 --> 35:57.110
Fine. Now that you've both
learned your lessons,

35:57.145 --> 35:58.679
how about starting
on the dishes?

35:58.680 --> 36:00.680
You're gonna need a fire hose
to clean this up.

36:00.813 --> 36:03.981
No, I cooked.
Someone else cleans up.

36:04.815 --> 36:06.149
Clean up.

36:06.183 --> 36:08.417
Who washed the pillowcase?
What?

36:08.451 --> 36:10.451
Esposito said C.S.U.
didn't find anything

36:10.485 --> 36:11.286
until they stripped the bed.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.554
That means there was saliva
on the pillow,

36:12.589 --> 36:13.756
but not on the pillowcase.

36:17.924 --> 36:20.293
You're right.
Someone washed the pillowcase.

36:20.327 --> 36:23.896
But the washer-dryer cycle
would've taken at least an hour.

36:23.930 --> 36:25.831
At which point, the roommate
would've been home.

36:25.865 --> 36:27.332
Irena couldn't
have gotten out in time.

36:27.367 --> 36:31.269
Only one person
could've cleaned the apartment.

36:31.304 --> 36:32.703
I-I don't understand.

36:32.738 --> 36:35.639
I thought you'd caught
the killer.

36:35.673 --> 36:37.774
We thought so, too.

36:37.808 --> 36:40.409
If it wasn't her,
then who?

36:40.443 --> 36:42.044
It was you, Danielle.

36:42.078 --> 36:44.445
Me?

36:44.480 --> 36:47.615
Oh, why would I kill
my best friend?

36:47.649 --> 36:48.717
In her research,

36:48.851 --> 36:52.052
Jessica describes being in
a dysfunctional relationship,

36:52.087 --> 36:54.953
one she was scared to leave

36:54.988 --> 36:56.355
because the other person

36:56.389 --> 36:57.324
had become
so dangerously codependent.

36:57.358 --> 36:59.192
At first we thought
it was her boyfriend Tyler.

37:00.026 --> 37:01.395
But it wasn't, was it?

37:01.396 --> 37:03.796
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:03.829 --> 37:07.063
The research that Matt
dropped off--her research--

37:07.098 --> 37:08.431
must've been very hurtful

37:08.466 --> 37:10.201
to read all the things
that she wrote about you.

37:10.235 --> 37:13.502
Jessica loved me.
She would never hurt me.

37:13.737 --> 37:16.105
"subject 'b' shows all the signs
of being a masochist,

37:16.139 --> 37:18.907
completely dependent
for her sense of self."

37:19.141 --> 37:20.608
We know you read
the files, Danielle.

37:20.643 --> 37:22.610
that's why you staged
her body that way.

37:22.645 --> 37:25.580
No, I didn't read anything.
There was nothing here.

37:25.581 --> 37:26.881
Because you got rid
of it all.

37:26.914 --> 37:29.115
You're wrong.
It had to have been you, Danielle.

37:29.149 --> 37:31.083
You were the only one
who had time

37:31.118 --> 37:31.919
to clean up after yourself.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.320
Judging from
her office space,

37:33.354 --> 37:34.554
Jessica wasn't
the kind of girl

37:34.589 --> 37:36.589
that scrubbed her floor clean
with bleach.

37:38.024 --> 37:41.659
Jessica told you...
she had to get away from you.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.997
She told you...
she was gonna leave.

37:49.299 --> 37:50.799
She...

37:50.834 --> 37:54.903
She was...
everything to me.

37:54.937 --> 37:57.838
I thought we were family.

37:57.873 --> 38:00.974
but then she wrote
those awful things!

38:01.009 --> 38:02.909
She had no right.

38:02.944 --> 38:05.878
What happened
that night?

38:05.913 --> 38:09.815
She said she was...
gonna move out,

38:09.849 --> 38:13.485
that she was done with me.

38:13.519 --> 38:17.488
I pushed her.

38:17.522 --> 38:19.290
She fell.

38:19.324 --> 38:21.691
Her head...
hit the table.

38:21.726 --> 38:23.826
She started to scream.

38:23.861 --> 38:25.828
She said--she said
she hated me!

38:25.862 --> 38:29.765
I told her to shut up!
I just wanted her to shut up.

38:29.799 --> 38:32.000
And then you put
a pillow over her head

38:32.034 --> 38:33.935
and you suffocated her.

38:36.138 --> 38:40.840
I... I didn't mean
to kill her.

38:40.875 --> 38:44.643
I just didn't want her to go.

38:52.584 --> 38:54.518
in the end,
Castle was right.

38:54.553 --> 38:57.121
The murder
was a crime of passion.

38:57.155 --> 38:59.622
The cuffs, the caramel
were all just theater

38:59.657 --> 39:00.724
to throw us off.

39:00.725 --> 39:01.825
I can't help but think

39:01.959 --> 39:04.260
that if Matt hadn't copied
Jessica's research,

39:04.294 --> 39:06.429
Danielle never would've read it,
none of this woulda happened.

39:06.430 --> 39:07.230
Well, now he won't get

39:07.264 --> 39:08.964
his precious little fellowship
or his degree.

39:08.999 --> 39:10.933
What about Lady Irena? What was
she doing at the apartment?

39:10.934 --> 39:11.934
Some of the girls thought

39:12.067 --> 39:13.501
that Jessica was working
off the books.

39:13.536 --> 39:15.337
So Irena came by to tell her
to knock it off.

39:15.338 --> 39:17.338
They had a glass of wine,
and she left.

39:17.372 --> 39:18.874
She just did it
on the wrong night.

39:18.875 --> 39:20.675
Yeah, but why'd she give you
such a hard time, then?

39:20.709 --> 39:22.476
Because she's a lawyer.

39:22.511 --> 39:23.879
