making a mess of the lives

00:11.760 --> 00:15.116
they were given by him upstairs

00:15.200 --> 00:18.431
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.229
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.320 --> 00:24.914
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.958
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.040 --> 00:32.033
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented

00:32.119 --> 00:36.989
to calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.517
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.752
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.913
You shit on our heads,
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.517
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.600 --> 00:59.876
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.794
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:03.880 --> 01:07.839

Thought you could do with cheering up.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.876
Come and give us a kiss.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.309
Aw...

02:51.400 --> 02:55.154
Whatever happens between you and Jamie,
I'm here, yeah?

02:55.240 --> 02:56.719

Look, if you two are a couple of
dolly divers,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.119
- don't you think it's time you came out?
- We're not gay.

03:29.200 --> 03:29.950
Yeah?

03:30.040 --> 03:30.995
Prove it.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.999
Thought not.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.594
Can give you a list of names
if you want.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.635
No, no need.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.156
It's all written on the bog walls
of The Jockey toilets.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.074
You did check that's not
Stella's healthy eating money?

03:45.160 --> 03:47.151
Oh, fuck.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.118
You're all right, Liam's school.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.918
- They want see you and Mum.
- How?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.877
Monica Gallagher?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.951
Hologram to the stars?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.268
Liam!

04:02.360 --> 04:03.952
Your sister's gay.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.793
And her butch mate, Max.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.029
Heard you rattling about downstairs
through the night, couldn't sleep again?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.189
No.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.872
Maybe you should take her out
for a coffee or something?

04:18.959 --> 04:22.236
I don't tell you how to run your marriage,
Mum, do I?

04:22.320 --> 04:24.436
Despite the obvious problems.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.433
Paddy?

04:55.520 --> 04:56.714
Paddy, I've got your tea.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.279
Yeah, well, I've just...

04:58.360 --> 04:59.918
Och...

05:00.000 --> 05:02.036
Argh. Wait a minute.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.036
HANDLE RATTLES

05:07.800 --> 05:09.313
Thanks.
I thought you were going out.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.834
I changed my mind.
SHE KICKS DOOR

05:11.920 --> 05:15.037
Open the door.
Open the fucking door.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.315
How am I going to help you
if you keep lying?

05:27.400 --> 05:28.879
I'm dealing with it.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.757
Jacking up in secret?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.398
Argh!

05:35.080 --> 05:37.594
Punch as many walls as you like.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.478
If you think for one minute
I'm going to leave you alone

05:40.560 --> 05:44.394
to fucking kill yourself,
then you've got another thing coming.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.439
From now on, wherever you go, I go.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.469
And if you want to shoot
this shit into your system,

05:54.560 --> 05:59.350
then at least,
I'll be here to pick up the pieces.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.589
DOOR SLAMS

06:07.040 --> 06:10.157
They wouldn't call your parents in on
a Saturday for touching a girl's breast.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.992
Try again.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.550
Imelda Ford got her arm stuck down
the drain trying to get a CD she dropped.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.390
Everyone... Hic!

06:16.480 --> 06:18.436
Everyone took a little pee on her.
It could be that.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.873
Pissed on a girl?

06:19.960 --> 06:21.518
- No, I faked it.
- Story of my life.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.079
When was this?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.151
About three months ago.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.673
Well, it's not that, is it?

06:26.760 --> 06:29.832
It's not fair. That's everything
I've ever done since I was, like, five.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.956
- Right, you, get up, stand in the door.
- What?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.429
Stand in the door and turn around.

06:37.800 --> 06:43.477
Right, anybody here heard that Liam's
smoking at lunchtime, raise their hands.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.677
Oh, very illuminating.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.516
Anything to tell us, Liam?

06:50.600 --> 06:53.160
All right. But it was
just those two times I smoked,

06:53.240 --> 06:56.630
and I only did it then cos
I would have got a kicking if I didn't.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.756
Oh, that's very helpful.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.957
And this isn't toast,
it's bread with a mild fucking suntan.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.235
And what is that smell?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.151
What?

07:06.240 --> 07:08.959
It does pong. Like a haddock's codpiece.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.918
- What do you expect? I'm a fishmonger.
- Fishmonger's apprentice.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.319
I'm earning a living.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.909
Oh, gosh, Carl!

07:18.000 --> 07:20.150
Fuck off, you're a vegetarian.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.359
Norma... What are you doing later?

07:24.440 --> 07:26.954
Well I thought I'd, er...

07:27.040 --> 07:28.996
end starvation in Africa.

07:29.080 --> 07:34.108
You know, broker a peace deal between
Israel and Palestine. A light lun...

07:36.160 --> 07:37.275
Whatever it is, no.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.238
Good luck.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.550
What?

07:43.640 --> 07:48.509
Dave. My top's in the wash, mate,
have you got a spare one?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.828
Fuck's sake.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.871
What are you doing?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.153
Fresh air.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.315
Oi!

08:22.400 --> 08:27.394
I don't think so, young lady. Do you think
I wouldn't notice a 20 missing?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.391
I wouldn't have to
if you actually paid us.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.472
- You get paid.
- You're talking pocket money. I'm 17.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.278
Going on 13.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.669
Keep your hands out of the fucking till.

08:38.880 --> 08:39.710
Bit harsh.

08:39.799 --> 08:43.349
You are the last person I would come to
for advice on mothering.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.398
And take them off,
you look like Ozzy fucking Osbourne.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.309
She doesn't mean anything by it.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.072
She enjoys it.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.754
The only reason she had us
was to push us around.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.879
That's not true.
It's not easy being a mam.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.191
Come to ours for a brew.
Your oestrogen's pumping.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.672
Don't you mean adrenalin?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.751
No, love, that's for headaches.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.238
- Can I give you a hand?
- No.

09:24.320 --> 09:28.359
Well, have you got any change
for the bandit, then?

09:28.440 --> 09:29.589
We're not open yet.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.831
Oh, go on, it'll keep me out your hair.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.831
What do you think?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.911
Get all that stuff down to the cellar
for us, would you?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.072
- My shift doesn't start for five minutes.
- All right, mate?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.036
Yeah.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.677
Pass me one of them, please.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.159
Get it your fucking self.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.390
Excuse me. I am half crippled here.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.836
And you're always going to be
if you sit on your arse and get served.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.878
Bye, Rog, love. Regards to the missus.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.392
Yes, love? Can I help you?

10:35.480 --> 10:37.038
Can I come in, please, lady?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.113
Rodney!

10:40.200 --> 10:41.918
Hiya, Mam.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.872
Jamie, lager's off.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.154
I'm on my break.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.516
- It's lunchtime.
- And I get a statutory 30 minutes.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.588
Not any more, you don't.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.159
You what?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.800
You're sacked.
Go and find somewhere else to work.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.154
Says who?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.310
Karen Maguire, licensee.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.391
How long have you been planning this?

11:11.480 --> 11:13.152
I could ask you the same question.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.118
You may be the licensee, Karen,
but if memory serves,

11:16.200 --> 11:18.475
it's less than 12 months
since both our names

11:18.560 --> 11:20.391
- went on the mortgage for this shitehole.
- So?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.277
So you're going to have to buy me out.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.271
Bollocks.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.396
Where am I going to find 40 grand?

11:27.480 --> 11:28.833
Not my problem.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.469
But if you don't find a buyer, I will.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.911
Last warning, Wurzel.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.912
Wind in your pop eyes, or I'm off.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.199
It's just distracting,
seeing you in Monica's gear.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.556
Well, I don't have owt mumsy
in my wardrobe.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.993
I'd hardly call that mumsy.

11:57.000 --> 11:57.955
Eyes front!

12:00.080 --> 12:02.230
What if they ask us about...

12:02.320 --> 12:05.756
- date of birth, middle names?
- Make it up. I do, no one ever notices.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.435
- What's his teacher's name?
- Who the fuck am I, Magnus Magnusson?

12:10.560 --> 12:12.676
Mr and Mrs Gallagher?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.274
Do you want to come through?

12:21.960 --> 12:23.359
Have a good long soak, son.

12:33.680 --> 12:37.389
- So? What's the story in Balamory?
- He seems different.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.675
No, I mean the very fact
that you've got a son

12:39.760 --> 12:41.796
has just come in
on the wires for most of us.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.316
He never saw eye-to-eye with Brendan.
As soon as he was 16 he were out the door,

12:45.400 --> 12:47.994
off to London,
streets paved with gold and all that.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.116
- Teenage runaway?
- No, he didn't run away.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.270
I tossed him out
by the scruff of the neck.

12:52.360 --> 12:56.114
- There were a lot of violence, you see.
- Tough on him, was he, Brendan?

12:56.200 --> 12:59.715
No, I used to batter lumps
out of the pair of them. Always bickering.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.915
Keep up, will you?

13:04.840 --> 13:07.070
I suppose I could have had more patience.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.673
And been more understanding.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.992
- Teenagers are hard work, Lillian.
- This could be my second chance.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.513
Oi, gropey. Mitts off.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.079
I was only trying to help.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.559
Well, don't fucking bother.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.153
Job's already taken.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.639
I asked her.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.676
What?

13:26.760 --> 13:31.276
She doesn't take any shit,
and you indulge me.

13:33.000 --> 13:33.910
I indulge you?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.639
Just for a couple of hours a day.

13:36.720 --> 13:41.316
It'll take the pressure off.
I'll pay her myself.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.595
Your private 17-year-old masseuse?

13:44.880 --> 13:47.235
I've got my eye on you.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.076
If I lose The Jockey, I lose everything.

13:57.160 --> 14:01.358
My home, my job. My future.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.477
Have you tried the bank? Your mum?

14:05.600 --> 14:08.512
"Hiya, not spoken to you
for nigh on two years.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.238
"Lend us 40 grand, would you?"

14:15.120 --> 14:16.792
He's such a prick.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.598
Yeah, but he's your prick.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.275
You don't have to go through with it
just to save face.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.476
Marriage is more important than that.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.274
That's exactly why I do
have to go through with it.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.273
If he's prepared to just walk,
am I supposed to fight to keep him?

14:42.600 --> 14:46.434
Carl, I will give you money not to come
in here when you smell like that.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.590
It's my job!

14:50.880 --> 14:52.279
You cannot give in.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.998
It's my marriage.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.513
If you back down now,

14:55.600 --> 14:58.160
you'll be pussy-whipped
for the rest of your days.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.357
She'll be wearing the trousers,
and you'll be "her indoors".

15:01.440 --> 15:04.989
I just don't want wounded pride
to paint us into a corner, that's all.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.753
Listen, let me tell you
something about women, mate.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.674
The only reason they challenge you
is so that you'll put them in their place.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.514
It's primal. They want you to master them.
That's why you've got the balls.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.717
So how come she holds this licensee
thing like a sword over my head?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.551
Just telling you the way it is, mate.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.792
We recently ran tests to identify pupils
with natural leadership qualities.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.633
And Liam's score was off the scale.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.188
Maths, IT, English.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.192
He's at least two years
ahead of his peers.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.794
With your permission,
we'd like to suggest Liam

15:38.880 --> 15:42.839
for the Kofi Annan multifaith
accelerated learning scheme.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.478
- Right.
- Right.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.552
Based in Caracas,
it is an educational charity...

15:47.640 --> 15:52.270
running intensive academic workshops
for kids from all over Europe.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.115
Interviews start tomorrow,

15:56.200 --> 15:59.590
with a three-month residential
end of the year. Oh!

16:02.840 --> 16:06.674
Children who complete this programme
often go on to top universities,

16:06.760 --> 16:08.910
well-paid jobs. I've got a brochure.

16:12.920 --> 16:18.233
Timetable of classes, past student record.
I can arrange an interview for you,

16:18.320 --> 16:19.719
if you like.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.998
Any questions?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.992
Um... how much does it cost?

16:28.080 --> 16:32.119
Given Mr Gallagher's health issues...

16:32.200 --> 16:33.918
Gulf War Syndrome, isn't it?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.468
Yeah. Bonfire night, I'm in bits.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.438
Well, you'd be eligible
for a 100% bursary.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.193
Travel, hotels, expenses.

16:42.280 --> 16:46.910
If you don't mind me saying,
you don't seem particularly enthused.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.634
No, no, we're just...

16:51.720 --> 16:53.233
overwhelmed.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.197
Aren't we, love?

16:57.240 --> 16:58.798
Bye, then. Good luck.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.196
I said no touching.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.789
♪ La Cucaracha

17:06.880 --> 17:08.950
♪ La Cucaracha... ♪

17:11.040 --> 17:13.270
That's not Venezuelan, it's Mexican.

17:13.359 --> 17:14.315
So? It's all Spanish.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.994
Ow! It could be broke, you know.

17:18.079 --> 17:23.598
Good. I've scrubbed myself raw, and
I can still feel your clammy hand on us.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.750
Anyway, we can't afford it.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.114
I thought it were paid for.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.398
I'm talking about clothes, suitcases,
phone cards for when he's away.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.914
It won't be that much, Debs.
I could chip in.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.991
No! He can't just get cos he wants.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.914
Er, easy there, less-than-supernanny.
This is a chance for the kid.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.275
To do what? Show off?

17:42.360 --> 17:43.918
Make himself a target?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.355
How do you even know
they're going to look after him?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.351
I thought it would be good fun.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.237
Yeah, Debs, he's up for it.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.233
Education is a right, not a privilege.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.949
My sainted mother
fought all her days for that.

17:58.040 --> 18:06.436
Hey, we are exercising our right
to give the kid a good start.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.238
Well, he's still gonna
have to get through the interview.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.633
Debs!

18:16.880 --> 18:17.756
KNOCKING

18:17.840 --> 18:19.273
Come in.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.390
Do you want to tell me
what this is all about?

18:28.480 --> 18:29.674
What?

18:29.760 --> 18:30.954
With Liam.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.396
"We can't afford it.
Will he be safe? Will he be spoilt?"

18:34.480 --> 18:36.072
That is not like you.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.917
Well, maybe it should be.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.877
We never got chances. We were bright.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.678
- I wasn't.
- I was.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.952
Year 5,
week's trip to Lisbon to look at tiles,

18:49.040 --> 18:51.076
or cork, or something, I can't remember.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.799
I could have gone free,
but Mum and Dad lost the form.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.155
By the time they admitted it,
it was too late.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.277
- So Liam shouldn't get to go on this?
- Year 9.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.635
Two weeks in Russia for history.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.915
Oh, no parents available for signature.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.230
Year 9? You could have forged it.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.151
That's not the point!

19:08.240 --> 19:09.195
You know what?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.748
Fair enough. You're right.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.355
Why should he get to go to Venezuela?
Selfish bastard.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.755
What'll you do now?

19:21.840 --> 19:24.070
I've had enough of London.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.118
I'll stay up here for a bit, I reckon.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.476
Sleep rough at first,
but get on my feet in a year or two.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.549
Stay here for a bit.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.312
I wouldn't want to impose.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.355
You wouldn't be.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.589
I owe you that at least.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.035
Yeah, I suppose you do.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.509
Might find a girlfriend, settle down.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.315
Are you already set up?

19:43.400 --> 19:46.392
What was it you used to say?

19:46.480 --> 19:49.517
Ever want a girlfriend,
get down to the blind school.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.875
What's the point
of telling him he's Brad Pitt

19:52.960 --> 19:54.712
when there's a mirror in the house?

19:55.680 --> 19:57.352
So you've never had a girlfriend?

19:59.640 --> 20:00.993
32 and still got me cherry.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.429
Kelly, love.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.071
Don't worry if it's over quick.
Everyone's the same first time.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.835
Oh!

20:30.640 --> 20:33.438
SQUEALING

20:38.520 --> 20:39.839
Not a fan of London, then?

20:39.920 --> 20:41.512
Not as such!

20:41.600 --> 20:45.036
INTENSE SQUEALING

20:45.120 --> 20:46.712
What did you do to earn a crust?

20:46.800 --> 20:51.828
Worked at the palace as a footman.
Then I were a bouncer at Stringfellow's.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.557
This ain't doing it for me.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.073
Mind if we do doggy?

21:01.160 --> 21:04.391
♪ Would I lie to you?

21:04.480 --> 21:08.189

There's no-one else but you

21:08.280 --> 21:11.352
♪ Would I lie to you baby, yeah? ♪

21:11.440 --> 21:13.032
I found it in a skip.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.678
Fish. Fishmonger.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.354
Cool. Nice one.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.795
Have a drink?

21:26.080 --> 21:27.035
Drink, dovelet?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.348
Yeah.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.238
Karen? Pint of lemonade,
large voddy, one for the wife.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.595
No fella?

21:33.680 --> 21:35.352
Work.

21:35.440 --> 21:36.634
Feathering his nest?

21:36.720 --> 21:37.630
Eh?

21:37.720 --> 21:40.359
Putting the hours in.
Getting ready for kiddies.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.793
Bit soon for this chat, Mam.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.713
Nobody knows
what's in the future, Mandy.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.758
Take your happiness while you can.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.071
Front of the queue when
they dished out dobbers, weren't you?

21:57.160 --> 22:00.152
I didn't think blokes could get a stiffy
while having a wee.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.800
Yeah, well, they probably didn't
have a pretty girl holding them

22:02.880 --> 22:04.359
when they did that experiment.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.034
I'm sure my son
can manage that on his own.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.076
He would be doing it if he could.

22:09.160 --> 22:12.948
Do you think you could shake it off
a little bit next time, please?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.156
Mam.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.070
I'm just taking a piss, for fuck's sake.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.390
And I'm just keeping you company.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.599
Karen, do us a favour.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.989
Have Katie with you tonight.
Joe's coming over.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.991
Course.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.233
Cheers.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.789
Hello?

23:07.480 --> 23:08.708
Get done for that.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.470
Polite society,
we usually wait until they're conscious.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.120
- I wasn't doing owt.
- Whatever.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.555
- Look, wait...
- Don't bother me if you're a flamer.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.868
I'm not.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.515
I've got a lump.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.114
On me balls.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.873
I was just checking to see
that Carl's was the same.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.155
You didn't think to wait till he's awake
and ask him?

23:35.240 --> 23:37.913
It's not the sort of thing
lads talk about, is it?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.672
Plus, I'm barred from me GP's.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.273
What's it like, this lump?

23:41.360 --> 23:42.475
A pea.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.795
No, gristle.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.313
Like a ball of dead hard snot.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.389
Where?

23:48.480 --> 23:52.519
Sort of like...
Well, you can have a feel if you want.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.953
I'll pass, ta.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.275
It's probably nothing.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.511
But tomorrow, straight down
to t'medical centre, get it checked.

24:50.680 --> 24:51.908
- Fuck's sake.
- Ssh.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.036
- Where's Mandy?
- She's asleep.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.156
What you doing?

24:59.040 --> 25:00.439
No way. Get out.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.635
Come on.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.634
You want it just as much as I do.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.117
She's my best mate. I can't.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.428
(You can.)

25:16.200 --> 25:19.158
BARKING

25:58.120 --> 25:59.553
Karen?

26:01.840 --> 26:03.592
Karen?

26:03.680 --> 26:05.557
RETCHING

26:13.160 --> 26:14.798
Cheers, Mum.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.835
Fuck the tea.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.030
I carried you in my belly for nine months

26:19.120 --> 26:20.951
and wiped your arse for years after.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.508
I have a right to insist on being heard.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.109
<i>If you love her, if you love her,</i>

26:28.200 --> 26:31.670
don't be steamrollered to the point
of no return by your mates,

26:31.760 --> 26:35.548
or by that stupid stubborn streak you've
had in you since you were knee high.

26:35.640 --> 26:40.077
If there's something in your marriage
worth fighting for, then do it.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.754
And you were right
with your smart-arse comments

26:43.840 --> 26:45.637
about problems in my marriage.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.075
That's why you see me
padding up and down here

26:48.160 --> 26:51.118
like a fucking tea lady-cum-night nurse.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.634
Because there's something
worth fighting for.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.275
Stop moping around like a big fanny.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.636
Sort your head out. Make a decision.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.349
That's all.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.879
Right. OK.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.837
This is as far as I go, son.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.434
Parents got to make themselves scarce,
you know.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.557
See how you cope under
the scrutinising eye of the examiner.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.871
It's not an exam. It's an interview.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.598
Yeah, I know. I'm just...

27:38.080 --> 27:41.914
Why the long face? Said the jockey.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.309
Look, son. You've got a chance
to do something interesting.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.516
If you get it, great. If not, fuck it.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.635
Excuse me.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.119
What?

27:49.200 --> 27:51.555
Yes, that was the F word.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.713
Used as an active verb
in an idiomatic context.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.039
God! I loved this place.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.156
Taught me a lot.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.749
You went to uni?

28:04.840 --> 28:09.595
Well, not exactly.
I was about your age, a bit older maybe.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.034
Began me education here.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.838
Broadened me horizons.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.317
Yeah, I learned the value of books.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.237
Spent a lot of time in the library.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.389
What about Debbie?

28:23.480 --> 28:26.040
Look, she'll support you, son.

28:26.120 --> 28:30.318
She's just going through a cranky...

28:30.400 --> 28:31.833
decade.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.153
I'll be around, yeah?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.111
Fuck me!

29:11.040 --> 29:14.316
I'll be in the lecture hall, Frank.
Sure you'll be all right, son?

29:14.400 --> 29:15.355
Yeah.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.396
Becoming quite the reader, aren't you?

29:29.400 --> 29:32.710
So, Liam, why do you think
you should get this chance?

29:34.080 --> 29:35.274
Dunno.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.872
You've been recommended by your school.
Must be clever?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.552
Suppose.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.917
Why is education
important in society, Liam?

29:52.880 --> 29:56.236
How could I collect?
His dog kept trying to shag me leg.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.992
Had its lipstick out and everything.
It was massive.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.435
The dog, or his lipstick?

30:01.640 --> 30:02.834
The dog.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.276
Not good enough, Mickey. Men not fit
to wipe my arse laughing at us.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.669
<i>It's time to let them know I'm back</i>

30:08.760 --> 30:09.795
in town.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.189
So, love of my life, how do I look?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.271
Like on our wedding day.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.395
I won't let you down.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.598
Thought I'd come for the ride.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.078
Grand.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.633
Relax.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.515
Look.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.354
Your leg, it's moving!

30:51.440 --> 30:53.317
How good am I?

30:55.760 --> 30:58.194
Did you have much contact
when he were in London?

30:58.280 --> 30:59.395
First couple of years.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.790
I was so proud of him working
in the Prime Minister's office at 18.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.233
Thought it were the palace?

31:04.320 --> 31:05.753
Palace? Don't be soft.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.279
What's going on?

31:13.360 --> 31:14.918
It's, um... massage oil.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.388
I can move my leg.

31:18.480 --> 31:22.189
No, enough.
Twice is plenty for one morning.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.316
What? I'm the boss's son.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.992
Not slow out of the blocks, is he?

31:26.080 --> 31:29.197
For someone who's just broke his duck.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.714
Come on.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.994
Thank you.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.991
And the small sweetener we discussed.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.791
Ever disrespect this family,

32:00.880 --> 32:06.238
and I'll hunt you down
and chop off your cock with a rusty blade.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.878
Do you fucking hear me?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.234
HE GROANS

32:09.320 --> 32:11.436
Now fuck off!

32:21.120 --> 32:25.750
Yes. I think we've seen enough, Liam.
Thank you.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.999
- What in the name?
- Sorry, sir.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.514
This man's been apprehended
stealing from the library.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.353
Says his son's being interviewed here.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.112
It's all a mistake, kid.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.838
- What did he steal?
- A book.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.592
I didn't steal it. I liberated it.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.069
Knowledge shouldn't be kept
under lock and key.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.355
Give it back, Dad.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.350
Where is the book?

32:53.840 --> 32:55.319
The Joy Of Sex?

32:55.400 --> 32:58.039
It's a standard text.

32:58.120 --> 33:01.829
An intelligent sex manual
that is serious without being solemn.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.037
If you're not going to put him on the
programme because of this, it's your loss.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.350
How much difference
is it gonna make for some kid

33:07.440 --> 33:10.477
who gets dropped off at a grammar school
in a 4x4 every morning?

33:10.560 --> 33:12.994
An experience like this
could change Liam's life.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.196
He hasn't exactly set the heather on fire.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.473
Education, from the Latin "educare",

33:19.560 --> 33:25.351
is important in society because more
than money, more than status or wealth,

33:25.440 --> 33:28.273
it frees a person from
the physical circumstances of their life

33:28.360 --> 33:30.999
and lets them come to their own opinion
of the world.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.595
And you can stop
looking down your noses at us,

33:34.680 --> 33:38.195
because education isn't a gift
for you to give or hold back.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.875
And if I don't get it here, I'll...
get it somewhere else!

33:46.160 --> 33:49.152
You were doing so good
up until that last bit.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.720
Can we talk?

33:57.800 --> 33:58.835
Please?

33:58.920 --> 34:00.319
About what?

34:00.400 --> 34:01.355
Everything.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.238
Before it's too late.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.434
I hope you don't mind,
but we brought our own.

34:08.520 --> 34:11.398
- Celebrating?
- Hmm. A toast.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.232
To?

34:14.480 --> 34:16.436
Me. Your new partner.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.272
No fucking way.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.873
He offered.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.679
He's my boyfriend.
What was I gonna do, not tell him?

34:22.760 --> 34:24.351
You're buying me out?

34:24.440 --> 34:27.556
I was gonna ring,
but Mandy thought it better face-to-face.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.072
You wanted out. He's got cash.

34:29.159 --> 34:32.038
- What the fuck do you get out of it?
- It's a little estate.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.235
Pubs can earn a mint
as long as they're run right.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.435
Well, we don't want it.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.158
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.754
Jamie?

34:39.840 --> 34:41.319
Does my name go on the licence?

34:49.280 --> 34:50.235
It's yours, mate.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.829
Jamie!

34:54.440 --> 34:58.797
Don't worry, Karen. I promise to be
more of a... sleeping partner.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.752
How could The Joy Of Sex
mean a lot to you?

35:10.840 --> 35:13.673
Don't jump to conclusions, smartarse.

35:13.760 --> 35:17.275
Something profound happened.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.437
WOMAN GASP AND GROANS

35:34.600 --> 35:36.511
Was it Gran?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.830
Wash your mouth out! No.

35:38.920 --> 35:43.630
It was just... two horny students
avoiding their revision.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.109
<i>It was an epiphany.</i>

35:48.200 --> 35:53.035
<i>It made me realise
that there's more to life than books.</i>

35:53.120 --> 35:56.237
<i>That's what books taught me.</i>

35:59.960 --> 36:01.234
OK, will do.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.117
Apparently, you can go.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.679
Oh, great.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.318
What about?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.515
I wouldn't hold your breath.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.516
Come on, son.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.359
What did the doctor say?

36:26.440 --> 36:28.192
Well...

36:28.280 --> 36:30.111
Mickey, for fuck's sake!

36:30.200 --> 36:31.189
Yeah, it's, er...

36:33.440 --> 36:35.078
Fuck off!

36:35.160 --> 36:39.597
I'm an auxiliary nurse. I've seen more
cocks than George Michael's Jacuzzi.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.319
Ah! Bit of delicacy!

36:44.440 --> 36:45.714
Nowt on that one.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.712
Mickey, those DVDs are shit...
Fucking hell.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.074
- It's not what it looks like.
- No.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.469
You might want to close the door.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.279
Look what you've done now!

36:55.360 --> 36:56.509
Me?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.909
- Thinks we're at it!
- Fuck off.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.991
There is no lump, is there?

37:01.080 --> 37:03.469
I'm not a poof.

37:03.560 --> 37:08.156
Argh! All right! But if Carl knows owt
he'll suss I've been looking at his knob.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.958
As knobs go, I've had worse.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.314
You've had him?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.158
I'm confused.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.673
How come?

37:15.760 --> 37:18.832
I don't know if I've got a semi-on
cos I'm thinking about Carl,

37:18.920 --> 37:21.388
- or cos you're fondling me bollocks.
- Oh!

37:24.160 --> 37:26.071
(Mickey) Feel that's what we've got.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.071
Un-re-quitted lust.

37:28.160 --> 37:32.915
<i>I've had mine requited.
Could do with a bit more requiting.</i>

37:34.400 --> 37:35.753
You sure about this story?

37:35.840 --> 37:36.750
Yes.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.112
Let me know if I'm being a gooseberry.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.553
She was wanking me off.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.871
Needed a few quid. Nurses' pay is shite.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.837
I didn't enjoy it.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.876
Me neither.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.073
- He's a good-looking lad.
- Yeah, he is.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.878
Christ, he smells like an hooker's gusset.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.269
I thought we were gonna gip.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.475
THEY LAUGH

38:17.920 --> 38:18.955
I was trying to help.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.031
Next time, don't bother.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.349
Can't win with you.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.472
If I help you're in a strop.
If I don't you're still in a strop.

38:27.560 --> 38:30.950
You of all people should know the shit
that you've just dropped me in.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.155
Meaning what?

38:32.240 --> 38:34.356
Meaning Joe's gonna be on me fucking back.

38:34.440 --> 38:35.919
Just like he's on yours.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.118
Don't dare insult me by denying it again.

38:51.800 --> 38:56.430
We're out of tonic.
I'll pop out and get some.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.871
Mimo.

39:01.960 --> 39:02.915
What?

39:05.240 --> 39:06.639
I need time on my own.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.513
HE GROANS

39:19.440 --> 39:22.273
I thought I could do this,
but my head's exploding and...

39:28.040 --> 39:31.828
I need some relief.
Just ten minutes is all I'm asking.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.793
Do it, then.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.791
But I'll be there.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.637
I didn't want this.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.439
I know.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.670
I had no choice.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.955
Hush now.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.553
Forgive me.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.879
I already have.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.434
It's all her fault.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.718
Should never have fell for her.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.309
She did this.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.032
She did this...

40:22.120 --> 40:24.634
(Voice echoes)
She did this... She... She...

40:24.720 --> 40:26.199
She... She did this...

40:44.600 --> 40:45.555
Squeeze.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.993
Go on, hard.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.629
- Harder, now really go for it.
- Don't fucking think so!

40:50.720 --> 40:55.032
- Just doing his exercises.
- I'll exercise your fucking face!

40:55.120 --> 40:56.553
Kel, no!

40:56.640 --> 40:58.551
Look, me hand.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.631
I can... I can move it.

41:02.440 --> 41:05.796
Not sure whether to hug you
or hack you to bits, fucking tramp.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.757
I got no pleasure out of it.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.239
"Hard. Harder!"

41:09.320 --> 41:13.154
- It was a bit of encouragement.
- She did fix my hand, Kel.

41:17.400 --> 41:21.109
Get him walking again,
I'll double what he's paying you.

41:21.200 --> 41:25.432
But no shagging.
Groping strictly with clothes on.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.357
Sound.

41:28.440 --> 41:29.953
KNOCK AT DOOR

41:35.920 --> 41:37.148
Looking for Rodney Tyler.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.153
Thought you might like this.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.749
You don't look too happy for a man
who's just been given 40 grand.

41:58.840 --> 42:02.389
Just never thought
it would come to this.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.675
It's what she wanted, mate.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.998
Look after her, will you?

42:18.440 --> 42:19.509
Shit!

42:21.440 --> 42:22.395
Butterfingers.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.994
Last night - fucking ace, or what?

42:36.640 --> 42:38.312
It never happened.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.833
She's me best mate.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.310
Her little girl in my room
while I fuck her bloke.

42:43.400 --> 42:46.790
What sort of a cunt
does that make me?

42:48.400 --> 42:49.833
The best sort.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.717
Wet.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.711
It stops now.

43:01.040 --> 43:04.157
This... belongs to me now.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.673
End of.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.756
LAUGHTER IN BACKGROUND

43:24.840 --> 43:26.193
(Kelly) Pensioners!

43:26.280 --> 43:30.273
In Wigan! Think they'd have enough
misery in their lives living in Wigan

43:30.360 --> 43:32.237
wi'out you robbing them
of their life savings!

43:32.320 --> 43:35.118
- How could you, Rodney?
- It's all a misunderstanding, Mum...

43:35.200 --> 43:37.191
Don't even fucking go there! And you?

43:37.280 --> 43:40.113
Might have told me that the fucking
Elephant Man here were a pathological liar

43:40.200 --> 43:42.395
before I took him upstairs
and humped him.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.438
- He said he'd changed.
- That's what liars fucking do!

43:45.520 --> 43:47.272
I should go.

43:49.280 --> 43:52.875
- Thanks for not turning us in.
- Don't try the pathetic act with me

43:52.960 --> 43:57.192
or you'll have your bollocks
for paperweights.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.431
Wait. I can't see you out
in t'street empty-handed.

44:04.080 --> 44:07.516
- Are you mental?
- I have a responsibility as a mother.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.996
Nice one, man.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.992
You are one soft touch, Lillian.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.559
It's the counterfeits.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.676
- What?
- The forged bank notes.

44:24.760 --> 44:28.230
I have a responsibility. I can't have him
going round robbing old ladies.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.675
As soon as he starts to spend that,
he'll get lifted.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.876
You crafty cow!

44:32.960 --> 44:35.997
I'm doing it because I have to,
not because it makes me happy.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.792
KNOCK ON DOOR

44:48.320 --> 44:49.673
Can I come in?

44:56.800 --> 44:58.950
Hand-delivered it.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.189
Open it, then.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.271
I'll burn it, you know... if you want.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.669
Why would I want you to do that, idiot?

45:04.760 --> 45:10.118
Cos you're scared I'm gonna go away,
get a big head and never come back.

45:10.200 --> 45:15.672
No, I pray for that every night!
I'm so proud of you, Liam.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.789
You open it.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.275
You got it!

45:32.360 --> 45:34.635
You got in!

45:34.720 --> 45:38.235
Carl! Lan! He got it! He got in!

45:38.320 --> 45:39.912
- Dad!
- What?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.991
No way.

45:42.080 --> 45:44.150
Yes!

45:44.240 --> 45:48.472
<i>(Karen) We're always happy
in life, always,</i>

45:48.560 --> 45:52.189

45:57.040 --> 46:01.238
