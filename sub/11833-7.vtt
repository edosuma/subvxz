WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.637
(siren blows)

00:06.139 --> 00:07.240
(sighs)

00:07.273 --> 00:09.643
Okay, let's try
this again.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.711
After you got

00:10.744 --> 00:13.747
to Justin Fitzpatrick's
apartment, what did you do?

00:23.323 --> 00:24.758
What about when
the cops found you

00:24.791 --> 00:27.460
at Justin's apartment
afterwards?

00:27.493 --> 00:30.731
Did you say anything
to the arresting officer?

00:32.665 --> 00:35.335
You know, Darlene,
it's going to help me a lot

00:35.368 --> 00:37.403
if you say something.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.473
Hey, I ain't doing this
'cause I want to.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.309
I got this court-appointed.
You know what that means?

00:43.343 --> 00:45.078
A judge told me
I had to take it--

00:45.111 --> 00:47.614
No pay, no headlines,
and I got to tell you,

00:47.648 --> 00:50.316
it looks open and shut.
So, if you want me to go in

00:50.350 --> 00:51.752
and say something
to the judge and jury,

00:51.785 --> 00:53.419
you got to give it to me.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.089
You want to know
what happened?

00:56.122 --> 00:58.091
In your words, yes.

00:58.124 --> 01:00.360
Justin Fitzpatrick
raped me.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.729
I got a gun, I went up
to his apartment,

01:02.763 --> 01:04.497
and I killed him.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.133
Take that to the judge
and jury.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.573
(music playing)

01:56.449 --> 01:58.384
(horn blows)

02:01.522 --> 02:03.489
When did you
first notice it?

02:03.524 --> 02:07.493
Mm, like three days ago.
It was red and sore.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.795
I thought
I scraped it somehow.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.799
Well, you're right.
It is infected.

02:12.833 --> 02:18.204
But, Lucy,
this is a bite mark.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.506
What, like a spider?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.341
Not a spider. It's human.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.810
Did somebody bite you?

02:23.844 --> 02:25.478
Excuse me?

02:25.512 --> 02:27.247
This is a human bite mark.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.950
If someone bit me,
I think I'd know.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.386
Well, has anybody
been in the area recently?

02:33.419 --> 02:36.823
Yeah, my boyfriend,
but he doesn't bite.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.725
Are you sure?

02:38.759 --> 02:42.262
He is so conservative.
He, um, he doesn't bite.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.230
Well, I suggest
you ask him.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.666
You've been bitten.

02:46.900 --> 02:47.768
In the meantime,

02:47.801 --> 02:50.637
let's get you started
on some antibiotics.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.441
You go in there
with that attitude

02:55.475 --> 02:57.410
and "the bastard got
what he deserved" line,

02:57.443 --> 02:58.612
and they're going
to put you away for life.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.246
They're going to
put me away no matter--

03:00.280 --> 03:01.481
Not if we can mitigate.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.817
What are you going to do
that's so genius?

03:03.850 --> 03:04.718
I'm going to let them know

03:04.751 --> 03:06.587
how you weren't thinking
straight, for one.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.655
But I was.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.826
Let me explain this.
Revenge doesn't justify murder,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.561
no matter what the guy
did to you first.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.698
But after a person
has been violated

03:17.731 --> 03:19.299
like he did to you,

03:19.332 --> 03:21.434
they might not be clearheaded
for a long time after.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.503
But that wasn't--

03:22.536 --> 03:23.970
Listen to me.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.673
What I'm thinking
could've happened is

03:26.707 --> 03:30.310
after Jason raped you,
you were upset, confused--

03:30.343 --> 03:30.977
I was angry.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.279
Exactly. You were angry,

03:33.313 --> 03:34.848
not in your right mind.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.683
That's what you're trying
to say, right?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.384
Is that what
you want me to say?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.487
Look...

03:41.522 --> 03:43.489
you want to make me
some kind of bad guy,

03:43.524 --> 03:45.759
go ahead.
I'm just trying to help.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.294
You're the one facing
murder one,

03:48.328 --> 03:50.931
and as it stands now,
you're going down.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.507
What's going on?

04:03.043 --> 04:06.379
I have this lesion
on my breast.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.047
What?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.515
It's not cancer.
Don't worry.

04:08.549 --> 04:12.553
It's just, like,
kind of a cut.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.023
This is so embarrassing
to ask you,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.993
but you have to be totally
honest with me, okay?

04:20.026 --> 04:21.361
Of course.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.363
Last week after our date,

04:23.396 --> 04:27.400
you were, you know, kind of
fooling around in that area.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.702
You let me.

04:28.735 --> 04:29.970
I'm not saying
it wasn't consensual.

04:30.003 --> 04:34.708
I'm-- look, while you
were kissing my...

04:37.443 --> 04:38.645
did you bite me?

04:38.679 --> 04:39.813
What?

04:39.846 --> 04:41.582
The doctor said--
Did I bite you?

04:41.615 --> 04:42.749
Shh. Not so loud.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.817
I didn't bite you.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.485
Are you sure?

04:45.519 --> 04:47.420
Of course, I'm sure.
I didn't bite you.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.323
Look, I'm not angry if
you did. I just need to--

04:50.356 --> 04:54.561
I didn't. Lucy, I promise.
I never bit you.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.396
Malcolm, you were the only guy
that I've been with--

04:56.429 --> 04:59.465
I didn't. I swear.

05:00.366 --> 05:04.505
Well, if you didn't,
then... who did?

05:05.471 --> 05:06.907
JIMMY: For some reason,
I like her,

05:06.940 --> 05:07.974
even though she hates me.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.109
And even though
she's a murderer.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.846
She's a student, no priors.
She's not a bad kid at all.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.414
How long after the rape
did this happen?

05:14.447 --> 05:16.416
She waited an hour.

05:16.449 --> 05:17.618
And she emptied
her gun into him.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.385
REBECCA: It seems like
revenge to me.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.554
What about temp insanity?

05:20.587 --> 05:21.722
I listed it as a defense,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.023
but she doesn't want
to go that route.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.125
She says she was
in her right mind.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.761
Well, she's not, if that's
what she wants to go with.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.930
Look, if she won't cooperate,
ask the judge to be let out.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.598
I tried it already.
He said no.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.366
I'm the fourth lawyer.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.001
Why don't you go rape trauma?
Bring in a shrink,

05:35.035 --> 05:36.703
argue she was
in a dissociative state.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.439
I used this Dr. Starger
last week. She was pretty good.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.374
I don't know.

05:41.407 --> 05:43.109
Just put the rapist on trial.
Do the best you can.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.378
Bobby, can I talk
to you for a second?

05:45.411 --> 05:46.747
It's important.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.549
Well...

05:48.582 --> 05:51.518
Actually, Ellenor, um,
I'd rather talk to you.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.720
Please.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.523
What's up?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.626
Dr. Nettle-- that dentist
you recommended?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.662
Yeah, what about him?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.129
I think he bit me.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.899
What do you mean,
you think he bit you?

06:05.932 --> 06:06.667
Yeah, I got this cut

06:06.700 --> 06:09.503
on my breast,
and it got infected.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.505
My doctor says
it's a human bite.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.675
It wasn't Malcolm. I asked him.
So, it had to be Dr. Nettle.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.678
He put me out to remove
my wisdom teeth on Tuesday.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.714
You think
Dr. Nettle bit you?

06:20.747 --> 06:22.583
Yes.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.484
On your breast?

06:24.518 --> 06:26.753
I mean, there can't be
any other explanation.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.055
How well do you know
this guy?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.625
Well, he's Bobby's cousin,
and he recommended him to me.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.693
We all use him.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.728
Well, I'm telling you,
he bites.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.467
When I got to the apartment,
she was sitting

06:41.502 --> 06:43.169
across from the deceased
with a gun in her hand.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.071
Yes.
The defendant?

06:45.105 --> 06:45.939
Did you speak to her?

06:45.972 --> 06:47.040
Objection. Hearsay.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.475
Overruled.
Admission-- declaration
against interests.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.144
What did she say,
officer?

06:51.177 --> 06:52.979
She said
she shot the guy.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.881
Did she seem lucid?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.717
Objection-- foundation.
Calls for an opinion.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.885
Sustained.
Lay opinion.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.021
Did she appear calm?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.756
Yes, she did.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.025
Did she mention anything
about self-defense?

07:05.058 --> 07:07.828
No, she did not.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.731
What did Darlene Keating
look like, physically,

07:10.764 --> 07:11.932
when you entered
the apartment?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.668
She was bruised, some.
Black eye.

07:14.701 --> 07:17.538
Did you know that she had been
raped by the deceased?

07:17.571 --> 07:19.239
At that time,
no, I did not.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.974
You didn't know
that she'd been raped?

07:21.007 --> 07:22.175
No, I didn't.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.210
The bruises, the black eye--
you didn't know

07:24.244 --> 07:25.846
she got those injuries
while being raped?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.881
The commonwealth has stipulated
the defendant was raped.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.050
Defense counsel doesn't have
to keep saying it over and over.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.552
It's unpleasant
to hear it?

07:31.585 --> 07:32.719
Objection.
JUDGE STROUD: All right.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.920
I don't mean to make you
uncomfortable.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.989
Mr. Berluti, move along.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.894
Are you sure?

07:40.927 --> 07:42.729
Who else could it be?
It had to be him.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.765
Has he ever been
inappropriate with you?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.032
Well, not while
I'm conscious,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.801
but he does seem
a little weird.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.870
This isn't much evidence.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.638
Helen, come on.
She has a bite mark.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.739
Through the process
of elimination--

07:52.773 --> 07:55.842
Are you absolutely positive
it wasn't your boyfriend?

07:55.876 --> 07:57.678
He's positive,
and I believe him.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.614
I go to this dentist, too.
He does seem a little creepy.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.115
What is it with you people
and doctors?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.784
Don't start.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.185
Ellenor, your podiatrist
hacked off heads.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.721
Jimmy's dentist likes bugs.
Now you've got one that bites.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.790
Can you just arrest him
before he attacks somebody--

08:09.823 --> 08:11.692
I can't just arrest him.
I haven't got any evidence.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.560
It has to be him.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.761
You can issue a subpoena.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.097
You can get his files. You can
interview his other patients.

08:17.130 --> 08:21.001
If he bit Lucy, the chances are
he nibbled on somebody else.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.805
Her name
is Dr. Diane Starger.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.173
You need to be
completely open with her.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.175
Why, so she can say
I'm insane?

08:29.209 --> 08:31.712
Look, Darlene, you think
this is some stupid game,

08:31.745 --> 08:34.147
fine, let's call it that,
but this is how the game works.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.181
Talk to me like I'm 5,

08:35.215 --> 08:37.250
and I will fire you like
I fired the rest of them.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.052
Go ahead. I like to be able
to tell my clients

08:39.085 --> 08:41.655
I win my cases. This one here's
going to hurt my record.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.323
I'd be happy to let
some other lawyer

08:43.356 --> 08:44.825
come in and take the loss.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.561
My problem is, the judge
won't let that happen.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.563
So why don't you just listen
to what I'm going to say

08:49.596 --> 08:52.232
before you reject it on account
of you being smarter than me?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.240
The jury--
at least a few of them--

09:00.273 --> 09:02.576
would love to set you free.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.811
You were raped.
The guy had it coming.

09:04.845 --> 09:08.048
Some of those jurors are glad,
even, that you shot him,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.050
but they still need
a legal reason

09:10.083 --> 09:12.085
to say not guilty.

09:12.118 --> 09:16.256
Revenge isn't it.
Temporary insanity is.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.258
To get
to temporary insanity,

09:18.291 --> 09:20.093
I need a doctor.

09:20.126 --> 09:24.197
To get a doctor,
I need you to meet with one.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.209
Alan.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.344
Bobby, I think I'm in some
kind of trouble.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.613
Trouble how?

09:39.646 --> 09:41.682
I don't know.
I just got a subpoena

09:41.715 --> 09:43.617
to turn over my list
of patients and addresses.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.687
Can they do that? Do I have
to give them my patient list?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.054
That's privileged, isn't it?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.290
Actually, no. Did they say
why they want it?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.158
No. Here's the subpoena.
Hello, Lindsay.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.193
Hi.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.295
Seems legitimate.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.863
Could it be taxes?
I pay my taxes.

09:56.897 --> 09:57.664
Could it be taxes?

09:57.698 --> 10:00.333
Taxes would be
a Federal warrant.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.205
What are you doing here?

10:05.238 --> 10:07.373
The police
have subpoenaed my files.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.109
Yeah, you want
to know why?
Lucy, Lucy, hold on.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.711
I know why.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.245
I don't think anybody
should say anything here.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.947
We have a situation.
BOBBY: What's going on?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.716
What kind of situation?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.951
He bit me.
That's the situation.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.186
What, you think
I don't know?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.988
I got infected,
you bastard.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.256
What the hell
is going on?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.825
I have a bite mark
on my breast,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.727
and the doctor says
it's human.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.361
He put me under for
my wisdom teeth on Tuesday.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.896
He's the one
that bit me.

10:29.930 --> 10:33.333
I know it,
and so do the police.

10:33.366 --> 10:37.938
Alan? Alan?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.815
I'm so ashamed.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.117
I can't even bring myself
to look at you.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.953
You bit my assistant?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.856
I was just giving her
a little kiss.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.025
I certainly never meant
to break skin.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.894
I can't believe I did.

11:00.927 --> 11:05.799
Bobby... I know
I need help.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.400
I'm getting help.

11:07.433 --> 11:11.772
I... have a sickness.

11:11.805 --> 11:16.943
But... I can't...

11:16.977 --> 11:19.379
have a criminal record.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.349
I can't have-- My God.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.887
Alan, how many women
are we talking about here?

11:26.920 --> 11:31.024
Fondling-- very... many.

11:31.057 --> 11:36.763
Times where I have
lifted up a blouse

11:36.797 --> 11:41.034
and... peeked under it
and...

11:41.067 --> 11:43.069
bitten.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.305
Very few.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.808
Please help me.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.844
We need to work this out.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.387
I don't know what
you expect me to do.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.024
Just-- you said
it could be rape trauma.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.959
Oh, it could be, but she
would barely talk to me.

12:05.992 --> 12:06.760
She doesn't trust us.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.529
Look, if I get
on that witness stand

12:08.562 --> 12:10.230
based on a 30-minute
conversation,

12:10.263 --> 12:11.998
the district attorney
is going to filet me.

12:12.032 --> 12:12.966
You know that.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.434
In which case, I'm no
worse off than I am now.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.803
I don't think I can
help you, Mr. Berluti.

12:16.837 --> 12:22.108
Look, you don't want
to be here. Neither do I.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.846
But this woman
is a victim herself.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.848
I got a feeling about her.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.215
She needs somebody
to fight for her.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.117
I can't conclude
rape trauma.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.486
If you say it could
possibly be rape trauma,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.189
get in the standard,
I'll take it from there.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.092
Oh, in Rebecca's case,
you talked about flashbacks.

12:39.125 --> 12:43.129
I read where rape trauma
can cause flashbacks, too.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.565
Maybe you can get
something in on that.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.266
That could be good.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.938
LUCY: You're going
to represent him?

12:51.972 --> 12:52.706
I don't know.
I'm thinking--

12:52.739 --> 12:53.840
What do you mean,
you don't know?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.241
You either are,
or you're not.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.376
Ellenor, can I finish?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.146
Without, in fact,
confirming that he bit you--

13:00.180 --> 13:01.414
What is that
supposed to mean?
ELLENOR: Oh, my God.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.482
Hey!
You're his lawyer.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.117
Lucy, he's my cousin.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.485
How can you defend him?

13:05.519 --> 13:06.987
All right, Lucy and Lucy alone
in the conference room.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.889
Ellenor.
Unh-unh, no, you don't.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.223
I'm not going to let you
take advantage of her.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.558
I don't care if you
and your sicko cousin--

13:11.592 --> 13:12.959
I'm not taking
advantage of her!

13:12.993 --> 13:13.727
EUGENE: Bobby I don't
think this a good idea.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.561
You shouldn't be
representing him!

13:14.595 --> 13:17.163
Lucy, I am so sorry.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.999
All right, quiet. Don't you
be saying anything.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.868
Back in my office now.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.236
How can you do this?

13:23.269 --> 13:25.839
Bobby, you can't
represent him.

13:25.872 --> 13:28.274
We stick together
in this office, Bobby.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.442
If he molested Lucy--

13:29.475 --> 13:31.978
you think it's in Lucy's
interest to go to trial on this?

13:32.012 --> 13:34.615
Look, you can't advise her
if you're his attorney.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.882
Bobby, my office.

13:35.916 --> 13:36.550
Eugene--

13:36.583 --> 13:38.952
Now.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.426
What are you thinking?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.162
We can get
double waivers. We--

13:49.195 --> 13:52.899
He's my cousin.
He needs help.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.167
What about Lucy?

13:54.200 --> 13:55.235
I'm thinking of her, too.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.203
Both sides are served
by keeping this out of court.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.272
He bit her
while she was unconscious.

13:59.305 --> 14:02.909
If this is prosecuted,
of course, I won't defend him,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.945
but whoever does
will be attacking Lucy.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.947
She'll be the chief
prosecutorial witness.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.483
It's in everybody's interest
to make this go away.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.986
Well, it could be
too late for that.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.354
Helen's interrogating
patients.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.223
I just can't turn my back
on the guy.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.595
You and Ellenor
represent Lucy.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.629
Make sure she's protected.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.632
Yeah, we damn well
will protect her,

14:25.666 --> 14:26.667
and you won't get
any special treatment.

14:26.700 --> 14:31.204
I'm not asking for any.
Let's just get in a room.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.611
I'm saying it's possible

14:37.644 --> 14:40.246
that she was suffering
from rape trauma syndrome.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.216
Rape trauma syndrome--
could you explain that?

14:43.249 --> 14:45.285
It's an emotional
psychological reaction

14:45.318 --> 14:47.120
to the experience
of having been raped.

14:47.153 --> 14:50.991
The patient can actually
go into a dissociative state.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.292
What's that mean?

14:52.325 --> 14:55.128
It means she wouldn't know
what she was doing.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.598
So, she maybe didn't know
what she was doing

14:57.631 --> 15:00.133
when she got the gun
and shot Mr. Fitzpatrick?

15:00.166 --> 15:03.036
Well, we no longer
look at memory

15:03.069 --> 15:04.938
in terms of short-term
and long-term.

15:04.971 --> 15:08.208
We now realize that
there is procedural memory,

15:08.241 --> 15:09.209
which is where
in our minds

15:09.242 --> 15:11.211
we process
how to do things,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.947
and then there's
the semantic memory,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.049
which provides the why.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.151
now, in the case
of Ms. Keating,

15:18.184 --> 15:20.987
it's possible that she
was procedurally able

15:21.021 --> 15:22.656
to obtain a weapon
and use it,

15:22.689 --> 15:25.491
but the ability
to process that action

15:25.526 --> 15:27.528
within the context
of understanding

15:27.561 --> 15:30.030
right and wrong
simply wasn't there.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.166
She acted out of instinct,
out of fear.

15:33.199 --> 15:37.170
Fear? If she was afraid
of Mr. Fitzpatrick,

15:37.203 --> 15:39.305
why did she go
to his apartment alone?

15:39.339 --> 15:41.307
Well, sometimes
when a person

15:41.341 --> 15:43.644
is in a state of being
paralyzed by fear,

15:43.677 --> 15:46.580
they react in what is known
as a counterphobic fashion.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.649
I'm a little lost.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.652
When she was face to face
with her attacker once again,

15:51.685 --> 15:54.020
it caused a series
of flashbacks.

15:54.054 --> 15:57.591
And if she was once again
in the moment of her rape,

15:57.624 --> 16:00.527
then she may have once again
been afraid for her life.

16:00.561 --> 16:03.163
And in that fear,
she reacted in the only way

16:03.196 --> 16:05.766
that she perceived to be
available to her at the time.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.701
She shot him.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.770
You don't know
Ms. Keating suffered

16:09.803 --> 16:12.072
from rape trauma syndrome,
do you, doctor?

16:12.105 --> 16:15.175
To a medical certainty--
no, I can't say that.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.210
How long have
you been treating her?

16:17.243 --> 16:19.279
I've only had
one interview.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.347
When was that?
That was this morning.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.550
Yes.
About an hour ago?

16:23.584 --> 16:25.385
How many rape victims
have you worked with?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.319
Hundreds.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.154
How many of them
have killed their attackers,

16:28.188 --> 16:30.190
other than Ms. Keating?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.091
None.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.094
You testified Ms. Keating

16:34.127 --> 16:36.096
could have been
in a dissociative state

16:36.129 --> 16:38.732
when she shot and killed
Justin Fitzpatrick.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.700
Isn't it also possible

16:39.733 --> 16:43.136
that this could have been
an act of vengeance?

16:43.704 --> 16:45.338
That's possible.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.389
You'll have to testify.

17:03.423 --> 17:07.359
Obviously, things aren't
going great here.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.395
So, what do you
want me to do,

17:09.429 --> 17:11.531
act all insane up there?

17:11.565 --> 17:15.035
Talk to my dead mother?
Would that be good?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.540
Your only chance here
is to trust me.

17:19.573 --> 17:22.809
If you can't
give me that...

17:24.277 --> 17:25.712
Why do you care?

17:27.247 --> 17:30.150
That's one
I can't answer.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.519
You need to act sorry.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.788
I don't like
coaching witnesses,

17:34.821 --> 17:36.690
but it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world

17:36.723 --> 17:38.358
if you cried a little.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.562
Under the law, Darlene,
you're guilty of the crime.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.597
That doesn't mean it's over.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.667
Juries have been known to look
the other way on occasion,

17:46.700 --> 17:48.669
but they've got to want to.

17:48.702 --> 17:53.373
If you could cry,
it wouldn't hurt.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.415
How many does that make?

18:05.919 --> 18:08.254
Okay, thanks, Mike.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.557
Well, 17 women patients
were interviewed.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.192
None can report
any misconduct.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.459
How many patients
did he put under?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.729
Some. Police aren't
dropping the investigation,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.263
but so far,
Lucy's all we got.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.799
Looks tough.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.834
All right.

18:21.702 --> 18:22.903
I was coming home
from class.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.004
It must have been
around 10:00 at night.

18:24.037 --> 18:27.273
When I got near my building,
I saw Justin on the stoop.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.142
You knew Justin Fitzpatrick?

18:29.175 --> 18:31.912
Only from being hassled by him.
He lived in my building.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.447
Did you notice anything
unusual about him this night?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.551
He smelled of alcohol.
Other than that...

18:37.584 --> 18:39.419
tell the court
what happened.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.588
I just tried
to get by him,

18:43.757 --> 18:46.159
but as I went past,
he grabbed my ankle,

18:46.192 --> 18:47.894
asked me if I thought
I was too good for him.

18:47.928 --> 18:48.629
What did you do?

18:48.662 --> 18:50.931
I told him to let go.
He didn't,

18:50.964 --> 18:52.699
so, I kicked at him.
I hit his chin.

18:52.733 --> 18:55.569
He let go then
'cause I guess I hurt him.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.904
He was swearing and all.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.139
I got to the door
and unlocked it.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.642
I got into the foyer and tried
<i>to close the door behind me,</i>

19:01.675 --> 19:03.409
but it wouldn't close
fast enough.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.645
What happened next?

19:04.678 --> 19:06.479
He forced his way in,

19:06.513 --> 19:08.715
started yelling at me
to apologize.

19:08.749 --> 19:10.316
Were you scared?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.618
Yeah. I mean,

19:11.652 --> 19:14.254
he's got like a 100 pounds
on me or something.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.858
Anyway, I told him
to leave me alone again.

19:17.891 --> 19:18.725
That's when he grabbed me

19:18.759 --> 19:19.593
and said he'd leave me
alone, all right.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.662
<i>I tried to hit him</i>
<i>with my book,</i>

19:21.695 --> 19:23.797
but he grabbed it
out of my hand and said

19:23.830 --> 19:26.299
he'd show me what
it was like to be hit,

19:27.779 --> 19:32.606
and, uh, he started hitting me
in the face with the book.

19:33.574 --> 19:35.842
I could taste blood
in my mouth,

19:36.777 --> 19:38.378
like that metal taste.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.848
And then I must have
passed out,

19:41.882 --> 19:43.349
'cause the next thing
I remember--

19:43.383 --> 19:44.217
it was dark,

19:44.250 --> 19:45.652
and he was...

19:49.823 --> 19:51.658
he was on top of me...

19:53.660 --> 19:56.530
inside me.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.431
Raping you?

19:58.464 --> 19:59.666
Yes.

20:00.734 --> 20:03.737
I screamed, but he just
hit me again. No one came.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.843
I found out later we were
down in the boiler room.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.413
He just kept
pushing himself...

20:14.414 --> 20:15.982
and pushing...

20:16.416 --> 20:18.552
and pushing.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.690
And when he was done,
he just stood up and said...

20:27.694 --> 20:30.030
He said
I wasn't a bad lay.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.832
Did he say
anything else?

20:31.865 --> 20:33.499
Yeah.

20:33.534 --> 20:36.770
He said if I wanted some more,
he was just upstairs.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.939
Did you feel threatened
when he said that?

20:38.972 --> 20:40.874
Yeah, it was like
he was saying

20:40.907 --> 20:42.308
he could do it any time,
you know?

20:42.809 --> 20:45.411
What did you do then?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.948
I don't--

20:49.449 --> 20:50.416
it was kind of hazy,

20:50.450 --> 20:52.352
like I was dreaming
or something.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.320
Best you can remember.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.356
I cleaned my face,
changed.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.291
Why didn't you call
the police?

20:58.324 --> 20:59.059
I don't know.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.493
Why didn't you go
to the hospital?

21:00.527 --> 21:04.998
I don't know. I just--
all I could think...

21:08.502 --> 21:10.871
I was going to my grandma's,
and I didn't want her

21:10.904 --> 21:12.973
to see me all messed up,
to know I'd been...

21:14.040 --> 21:14.975
How come?

21:15.008 --> 21:17.544
'Cause she practically
raised me.

21:18.979 --> 21:20.380
But wouldn't she want
to help you?

21:20.413 --> 21:21.748
I guess. I don't know.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.451
She raised me
to be a good catholic,

21:25.485 --> 21:26.620
a good person.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.589
And good people
aren't crime victims?

21:28.622 --> 21:30.557
Not like this.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.494
So, what did you do?

21:34.528 --> 21:40.333
After... I cleaned myself...

21:40.366 --> 21:45.906
I sat on my bed
maybe for a half-hour or so.

21:47.007 --> 21:49.342
Then I got my gun.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.777
I keep it
in the nightstand.

21:51.712 --> 21:53.714
And I went upstairs
to his apartment.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.448
I knocked on the door.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.018
No one answered,
so, I knocked again.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.553
Then it opened,

22:00.754 --> 22:01.755
and he was standing there.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.991
<i>I pointed the gun,</i>
<i>and he went to back up.</i>

22:05.025 --> 22:08.028
I think he was saying,
"no, no, no,"

22:08.061 --> 22:09.996
and I started shooting.

22:10.030 --> 22:12.432
(gunshot)

22:12.465 --> 22:14.000
He fell to the ground,
and I kept shooting

22:14.034 --> 22:15.636
till there weren't
any more bullets.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.739
I think I pulled the trigger
a few times after that.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.007
(gun clicking)

22:32.085 --> 22:35.455
I have $85,000 in equity
in my home.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.058
As soon as I can refinance,
that money is yours.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.092
That's cheap.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.761
The jury will hit you
a lot harder than that.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.530
Present day value,
legal fees--

22:43.564 --> 22:47.167
$85,000 cash today is worth
a $300,000 verdict, Eugene.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.135
So, he'll just get off?

22:49.169 --> 22:51.572
And I don't mean that
like a pun, you perv.

22:51.605 --> 22:54.407
Lucy, I am already
in treatment.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.911
If I could just find the words
to convey my remorse--

22:57.944 --> 22:59.913
I'd say, "bite me,"
but you've already done that.

22:59.946 --> 23:00.947
BOBBY: All right.

23:00.981 --> 23:02.182
What assurance do we have

23:02.215 --> 23:04.518
that he's not going to continue
doing this to other patients?

23:04.551 --> 23:06.052
That really isn't
the concern here.

23:06.086 --> 23:07.621
We're making it our concern.

23:07.654 --> 23:10.156
He's already agreed
to have a hygienist

23:10.190 --> 23:11.825
or a female assistant
in the room with him

23:11.858 --> 23:13.527
at all times
during any procedure.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.661
How is that enforceable?

23:16.630 --> 23:18.565
Okay, this is how
it's got to be.

23:18.599 --> 23:21.434
You sign a statement which
amounts to a full confession.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.836
I keep it in my desk drawer.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.805
You agree
not to put patients under.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.874
If any want anesthesia, you
send them to another dentist.

23:27.908 --> 23:30.476
You also agree to random
reviews of your records

23:30.511 --> 23:32.478
and interviews
with your employees

23:32.513 --> 23:34.447
to make sure no patients
are being put under.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.082
If you violate the terms,

23:36.116 --> 23:37.818
we go to the D. A.
with the confession.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.185
That seems
a little extreme.

23:39.219 --> 23:40.687
Only way it's going to be,
Bobby.

23:40.721 --> 23:42.823
If Lucy agrees.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.458
We still have to talk it over
with her.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.494
Why don't you go discuss it
with your cousin?

23:56.870 --> 23:58.539
(door opens)

24:01.875 --> 24:03.744
(door closes)

24:08.148 --> 24:09.650
If this goes to trial,

24:09.683 --> 24:10.884
I don't see us
getting a conviction.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.053
You were unconscious.

24:13.086 --> 24:14.821
Reasonable doubt's
a gimme.

24:14.855 --> 24:16.790
Plus, you'd be the one
they put on trial.

24:16.823 --> 24:17.991
Bobby said he'd pass it off,

24:18.024 --> 24:19.492
but whatever defense
attorney gets it,

24:19.526 --> 24:20.794
he's going to have to
go after you.

24:20.827 --> 24:21.895
Your sex life...

24:21.928 --> 24:23.029
I'm not afraid.

24:23.063 --> 24:24.631
I know you're not.

24:24.665 --> 24:28.168
But I'd take these conditions,
plus the $85,000.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.203
I'm sure you could
use the money, Lucy.

24:32.939 --> 24:33.940
I don't know, Bobby.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.776
It feels like
a form of servitude.

24:35.809 --> 24:39.145
To avoid criminal prosecution,
you should be jumping.

24:39.179 --> 24:40.747
Don't even hesitate here.

24:41.582 --> 24:43.617
Thank you for standing
by me, Bobby,

24:43.650 --> 24:45.018
for defending me.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.153
I'm not defending
what you did.

24:47.187 --> 24:49.155
I'm helping
a sick relative.

24:49.189 --> 24:51.291
That's the way
I look at it.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.293
If you don't get treatment
and continue with this,

24:53.326 --> 24:57.197
I'll personally recommend
criminal prosecution.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.865
Those are my terms.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.203
(horn blows)

25:03.236 --> 25:05.739
After the rape,
you didn't call the police.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.007
You didn't
go to the hospital.

25:07.040 --> 25:07.974
That's right.

25:08.008 --> 25:10.010
You decided you wanted
to keep it to yourself?

25:10.043 --> 25:12.112
I didn't want to live my life
as a rape victim,

25:12.145 --> 25:13.246
having people
treat me different.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.281
So, you decided to get a
gun and shoot him

25:15.315 --> 25:16.983
so that people wouldn't
treat you different.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.151
BERLUTI:
Objection-- argumentative.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.786
Sustained.

25:20.621 --> 25:22.155
You cleaned up first,

25:22.188 --> 25:24.257
you sat on your bed
for a half-hour,

25:24.290 --> 25:26.660
then you got the gun.
Yes.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.694
You walked up
three flights of stairs...

25:27.728 --> 25:28.562
yes.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.295
Knocked on the door,

25:29.329 --> 25:30.130
when he opened it,
you shot him.

25:30.163 --> 25:31.598
Yes.

25:31.632 --> 25:33.099
He didn't have a weapon
when you shot him.
No.

25:33.133 --> 25:34.067
And as you testified,

25:34.100 --> 25:37.203
he was backing up
when you opened fire.
Yes.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.873
You seem sure.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.976
It happened
exactly like this?
Yes.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.077
You're completely clear.
Yes.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.313
Your memory couldn't be fuzzy?
It happened like I said.

25:47.347 --> 25:49.850
Before you said it was hazy,
like a dream.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.685
Is your recollection
clear or hazy?

25:51.718 --> 25:52.753
It's clear.

25:52.786 --> 25:54.254
Then why did you say it was
hazy if it's clear?

25:56.923 --> 25:58.324
Should I ask again?

25:59.159 --> 26:02.729
Why did you say it's hazy
if your memory's clear?

26:03.964 --> 26:06.299
Because my lawyer thinks I have
a better chance of being
acquitted.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.234
Have you been coached
by your lawyer?
Objection!

26:08.268 --> 26:09.469
Objection! This is work--

26:09.503 --> 26:11.838
I am entitled to explore whether
the witness has been coached.

26:11.872 --> 26:12.773
Objection!
Move to strike!

26:12.806 --> 26:16.009
All right, quiet.
I'll ask a few questions.

26:16.042 --> 26:19.145
Ms. Keating,
did your attorney instruct you

26:19.179 --> 26:20.914
to give untruthful answers?

26:24.184 --> 26:25.719
Yes.

26:25.752 --> 26:26.386
Your honor--

26:26.419 --> 26:27.821
Mr. Berluti, sit down.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.723
He told me to cry.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.158
He told me to get up here
and say how sorry I am.

26:32.192 --> 26:33.627
Well, I'm not sorry.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.728
Your honor--

26:34.761 --> 26:36.930
I want to give my testimony!
I want my day in court!

26:36.963 --> 26:42.102
He raped me, and I am not sorry
for killing him.

26:42.936 --> 26:45.672
And if he were suddenly
made alive today,

26:45.706 --> 26:48.842
I would go looking for my gun
so, I could kill him again.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.377
I only wish
he'd suffered more.

26:51.411 --> 26:54.180
I put him out
of his misery too fast,

26:54.214 --> 26:56.049
and that is all
I'm sorry about.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.885
That is my testimony.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.765
You don't want the jury
to feel sorry for you?

27:11.798 --> 27:14.701
Good. I don't, either.
Get ready for prison, Darlene.

27:14.735 --> 27:16.036
Get out of my face.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.039
You're going to do life,
the rest of your life,

27:19.072 --> 27:20.273
'cause you don't want
to ask for pity.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.174
Damn right.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.710
I can't help you--
I don't want your help!

27:25.111 --> 27:26.412
Why don't you cry?

27:27.347 --> 27:31.084
I hurt your win/loss record.
Why don't you go cry?

27:31.117 --> 27:33.687
You put a psychiatrist
up there to talk about me,

27:33.720 --> 27:35.221
she doesn't know me,
and neither do you.

27:35.255 --> 27:37.023
You don't know
the first thing!

27:38.859 --> 27:41.294
I've been feeling
bad for you,

27:41.327 --> 27:42.963
but you just
don't get it.

27:42.996 --> 27:45.231
I'm done feeling
bad for you.

27:45.265 --> 27:47.133
Good. Beat it.

27:48.301 --> 27:51.237
(music playing)

28:00.747 --> 28:02.182
You did everything
you could, Jimmy.

28:02.215 --> 28:04.818
She's a good person.
I know it.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.320
Never committed a crime
in her life before this.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.090
REBECCA: The D. A. won't
give you manslaughter?

28:10.123 --> 28:10.924
Not at this point.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.893
That's why I hate
court appointments.

28:12.926 --> 28:13.960
They're never grateful.

28:15.762 --> 28:16.997
Good day in court?

28:17.030 --> 28:19.265
Bobby, I'm giving you
my two weeks.

28:19.299 --> 28:20.466
What?

28:20.500 --> 28:22.235
I think I need
to quit.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.169
Come in my office.

28:23.203 --> 28:24.237
No.

28:25.305 --> 28:28.441
No, I'm not going in there
for one of your pep talks.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.111
I go for actions
over words.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.514
He's family, Lucy,
and we worked out

28:33.547 --> 28:36.082
a good result for you.
Ask Ellenor, Eugene.

28:36.116 --> 28:37.383
I know.

28:37.417 --> 28:38.985
I got a good deal.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.289
Then what?

28:43.323 --> 28:45.491
I don't like it that
I'm supposed to sit here

28:45.526 --> 28:46.993
feeling like I got
a good deal.

28:48.328 --> 28:50.363
I don't like it
that my boss is asking me

28:50.396 --> 28:52.298
to feel compassion for
the man that assaulted me,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.035
and I don't like it
that I feel

28:55.068 --> 28:57.270
like I'm disappointing you
by being angry at the guy.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.105
You're not
disappointing me.

28:59.139 --> 29:00.507
That's how it feels.

29:00.541 --> 29:02.809
I mean, you're feeling
sorry for him,

29:02.843 --> 29:04.144
and you're feeling
sorry for me.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.518
Look, I know that you guys
all teamed up

29:11.552 --> 29:15.088
and worked this out,
a lot to my benefit,

29:17.490 --> 29:19.092
and I'm grateful.

29:22.362 --> 29:25.065
I guess I didn't want
things worked out.

29:28.368 --> 29:31.471
I guess I don't really want
to be feeling grateful
at the moment,

29:33.306 --> 29:34.508
and I--

29:41.848 --> 29:44.184
(door slams)

29:48.922 --> 29:51.525
(horn blows)

29:51.558 --> 29:53.059
I think it's a mistake.

29:53.093 --> 29:54.260
So, you're saying
you won't arrest him?

29:54.294 --> 29:57.063
I'm not saying that,
but with you being

29:57.097 --> 29:59.265
the only complaining witness,
unconscious one at that--

29:59.299 --> 30:00.601
He admitted doing it.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.202
That was a settlement
negotiation.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.270
He can still deny it
at trial.

30:04.304 --> 30:06.907
Look, Lucy,
if you want to push this,

30:06.940 --> 30:09.142
I will back you
so long as you know

30:09.175 --> 30:11.044
how uphill the fight is,
that you will be attacked--

30:11.077 --> 30:15.115
I know. Look, I can't
just quietly settle this.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.351
$85,000 is a lot of money.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.253
He's a criminal.

30:22.422 --> 30:23.289
Okay.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.825
You've got yourself a D. A.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.293
Thank you.

30:32.065 --> 30:33.299
Mr. Berluti?

30:35.536 --> 30:38.404
Mr. Berluti?
We'll hear from you.

30:46.146 --> 30:48.615
I'm not sure
I got much to say.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.253
We all heard
Darlene Keating.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.521
Said she was clearheaded.

30:54.555 --> 30:56.657
Said she'd
do it again, even.

30:56.690 --> 31:00.661
Of course, I guess anybody
who'd say that at her own trial

31:00.694 --> 31:02.863
is anything but clearheaded.

31:03.530 --> 31:06.232
I've been trying,
the last few days,

31:06.266 --> 31:08.234
to get her to act sorry.

31:08.268 --> 31:11.137
But she didn't
kill the guy out of sorrow.

31:11.171 --> 31:12.606
She was angry,

31:12.639 --> 31:15.175
and I suddenly realized
we've all been trying

31:15.208 --> 31:17.678
to take that anger
away from her.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.146
And she's been trying
to tell me,

31:20.180 --> 31:21.682
and, yesterday, you,

31:21.715 --> 31:23.684
she's entitled to it.

31:23.717 --> 31:27.287
A man raped her--
brutally raped her.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.557
If she's entitled
to anything, it's anger.

31:30.591 --> 31:34.360
Did it justify revenge?
No.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.396
The law doesn't permit that,

31:36.429 --> 31:40.033
but the law doesn't demand that
she conceal her rage, either.

31:40.066 --> 31:43.003
The law doesn't say,
"keep your anger to yourself."

31:43.036 --> 31:46.306
The law doesn't say,
"let everybody see you cry."

31:47.674 --> 31:50.544
I've been wanting
to turn her into a victim

31:50.577 --> 31:52.546
'cause that's
how we're comfortable

31:52.579 --> 31:54.548
looking at women
who get raped--

31:54.581 --> 31:57.718
victims, ashamed.

31:57.751 --> 32:00.687
Darlene Keating
is nobody's victim.

32:00.721 --> 32:02.989
Not mine, not yours,

32:03.023 --> 32:05.025
not Justin Fitzpatrick's.

32:05.058 --> 32:07.193
Did she have
the legal right

32:07.227 --> 32:09.195
to kill the man
who raped her?

32:09.229 --> 32:10.496
No.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.999
But she lost herself
that night,

32:13.033 --> 32:14.134
ladies and gentlemen.

32:14.167 --> 32:16.136
I think she's still lost.

32:17.237 --> 32:20.173
A man forced himself
inside her

32:20.206 --> 32:23.309
and kept pushing himself
and pushing himself,

32:23.343 --> 32:27.480
and she reacted
with severe anger-- rage.

32:27.514 --> 32:29.082
Who wouldn't?

32:30.216 --> 32:32.619
You been there?
You?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.056
We're all sitting here,

32:36.089 --> 32:40.226
projecting what's a normal
reaction to being raped,

32:40.260 --> 32:43.063
expecting her to just cry.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.168
How about call the police?

32:48.201 --> 32:51.237
Now, that's a normal reaction.

32:51.271 --> 32:54.240
Revenge murder isn't.

32:54.274 --> 32:57.578
Victims of violent crimes
don't get a free pass

32:57.611 --> 32:59.713
to commit homicides,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:00.747 --> 33:01.748
And for the record,

33:01.782 --> 33:04.651
rage hadn't overcome
this woman's state of mind.

33:05.485 --> 33:07.453
No, she washed herself first.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.023
She sat on her bed calmly.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.225
She was calm
when the police got there.

33:12.258 --> 33:15.028
If anything, she acted
with a lot of poise.

33:16.396 --> 33:21.034
By her very own testimony,
she acted out of revenge.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.105
Some of you may be cheering
for her. I get that.

33:25.138 --> 33:27.541
I mean, there's one less
rapist on the street

33:27.574 --> 33:29.209
because of Darlene Keating.

33:29.242 --> 33:32.513
Emotionally, vigilantism
often feels good.

33:34.681 --> 33:36.650
But as much
as you might be glad

33:36.683 --> 33:38.484
that Justin Fitzpatrick
is dead,

33:38.519 --> 33:40.420
as much as it gives you
satisfaction

33:40.453 --> 33:42.789
that this bastard
got his due,

33:42.823 --> 33:46.527
the only question
you have to ask yourself is

33:46.560 --> 33:48.294
do you really think

33:48.328 --> 33:50.096
that she didn't know
right from wrong

33:50.130 --> 33:51.598
when she pulled that trigger?

33:53.700 --> 33:55.736
Be honest with this court.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.539
Be honest with yourself.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.248
(crowd chattering)

34:11.685 --> 34:14.420
They are allowing me to
surrender you at the courthouse.

34:14.454 --> 34:16.690
At least you won't be hauled in
in handcuffs.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.792
I can't believe
this is happening.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.360
Alan, I'll handle
the arraignment,

34:20.393 --> 34:22.328
but then you're going to have
to get another attorney.

34:22.362 --> 34:23.764
But if she doesn't
work here anymore--

34:23.797 --> 34:27.433
Doesn't matter. No one here is
going to be challenging
Lucy in court.

34:27.467 --> 34:28.869
We tried to settle this
without a fight,

34:28.902 --> 34:30.335
but now that it is one...

34:30.370 --> 34:31.772
Could you recommend somebody?

34:32.672 --> 34:34.107
I'd prefer not to.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.440
Will I be convicted?

34:35.475 --> 34:37.678
You said the settlement
conference is sealed, right?

34:37.710 --> 34:38.911
It's her word against mine.

34:38.945 --> 34:42.447
Yes, but I'm sure they're hoping
other women will come forward.

34:42.482 --> 34:44.784
This isn't fair!

34:46.485 --> 34:49.289
I know I brought it
on myself, but...

34:50.290 --> 34:51.891
Bobby, I never
hurt anybody.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.393
Alan, you did.

34:54.427 --> 34:56.697
You gave her an infection,

34:56.730 --> 34:58.732
leave aside
the sexual assault.

34:58.765 --> 35:02.202
It's-- well,
when they're so big--

35:02.235 --> 35:05.338
I-I have to work so close.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.307
I hover right over them
when I'm working.

35:07.340 --> 35:10.476
They're--
they're right there...

35:10.511 --> 35:12.546
for the touching.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.117
I just...
need to touch them.

35:20.554 --> 35:22.923
Alan, you did more
than touch them.

35:22.956 --> 35:25.659
I just held it in my hand...

35:26.927 --> 35:29.796
and it was so beautiful.

35:31.264 --> 35:37.097
Lucy, she's a little,
little girl with--

35:39.305 --> 35:41.241
they're so beautiful.

35:41.274 --> 35:42.876
Alan, um...

35:45.311 --> 35:47.247
I'll see you through
the arraignment,

35:47.280 --> 35:51.451
but then you need
to find other counsel.

35:52.385 --> 35:54.387
I never meant to hurt her.

36:12.806 --> 36:14.407
Would the defendant
please rise?

36:18.411 --> 36:20.514
Madame Foreperson,
you have reached a verdict?

36:20.547 --> 36:21.782
We have, your honor.

36:21.815 --> 36:23.349
What say you?

36:23.383 --> 36:25.586
Case number 4251--

36:25.619 --> 36:27.688
Commonwealth
vs. Darlene Keating

36:27.721 --> 36:30.991
on the charge of murder
in the second degree--

36:31.024 --> 36:34.961
We find the defendant
Darlene Keating guilty.

36:36.530 --> 36:38.932
JUDGE: Members of the jury,
this concludes your service.

36:38.965 --> 36:40.333
You are dismissed.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.703
Bailiff, take the defendant
into custody.

36:44.938 --> 36:46.306
I'm sorry.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.842
Yeah.

36:53.046 --> 36:56.717
(music playing)

37:16.903 --> 37:19.372
WOMAN: Case number 62463--

37:19.405 --> 37:22.342
Commonwealth vs. Alan Nettle--
sexual battery.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.878
Bobby Donnell for the defendant,
your honor. Waive reading.

37:24.911 --> 37:26.780
Helen Gamble for the
commonwealth, your honor.

37:26.813 --> 37:28.414
I'd like to wrap this up
right here.

37:28.448 --> 37:31.585
Be my guest. Court's
adjourned till tomorrow.

37:34.755 --> 37:36.723
Look, plead guilty
to misdemeanor battery.

37:36.757 --> 37:38.559
I'll recommend
straight probation,

37:38.592 --> 37:39.726
conditioned on counseling.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.361
Really?

37:41.394 --> 37:42.929
Lucy okay with that?

37:42.963 --> 37:44.698
She just wants
a guilty finding.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.568
We'll take it.

37:47.601 --> 37:50.003
Let me consult my client,
but... we'll take it.

37:50.036 --> 37:51.337
Okay.

37:51.371 --> 37:53.674
This could be over
before it starts.

37:53.707 --> 37:55.408
Plead guilty--
no time, no fine,

37:55.441 --> 37:56.510
conditioned on counseling.

37:56.543 --> 37:58.044
It'll be disposed of
in five minutes.

37:58.078 --> 37:59.479
What's the catch?

37:59.513 --> 38:01.481
Well, you plead guilty,
you will have a record.

38:01.515 --> 38:04.551
But the damage of a trial,
even if you were acquitted,

38:04.585 --> 38:06.386
would probably be worse.

38:06.419 --> 38:08.421
I just had to touch them.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.322
Alan...

38:10.456 --> 38:11.625
Okay. Okay.

38:20.801 --> 38:22.569
Can I talk to you
for a second?

38:23.670 --> 38:25.071
It's okay.
Case is over.

38:26.039 --> 38:26.873
Brave girl.

38:26.907 --> 38:28.341
I know.

38:28.875 --> 38:32.445
You turned down $85,000
for a guilty finding?

38:33.814 --> 38:36.750
Last year, when I was
videotaped in my shower,

38:36.783 --> 38:38.785
and now this while
I'm at the dentist?

38:39.720 --> 38:41.855
Bobby, I feel so powerless.

38:42.989 --> 38:44.658
I needed to do something.

38:46.492 --> 38:49.963
I mean, I couldn't
just sit around

38:49.996 --> 38:51.898
and let people
make it less bad.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.868
I needed...

38:54.901 --> 38:58.471
I don't know,
power of my own.

39:00.707 --> 39:02.943
I needed him to be
found guilty in court.

39:04.745 --> 39:06.513
I wanted to do something
to him.

39:07.781 --> 39:08.782
Okay.

39:09.883 --> 39:10.884
And quitting?

39:12.085 --> 39:14.020
I wanted to do something
to you.

39:17.023 --> 39:19.726
Well, you're also doing it
to Ellenor... Eugene.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.695
They fought for you here.

39:21.728 --> 39:23.730
Lindsay, Rebecca, Jimmy--

39:23.764 --> 39:25.999
these people who you once
thought so resisted you

39:26.032 --> 39:27.568
have come to love you.

39:29.069 --> 39:30.804
What Ellenor said about
people in our office

39:30.837 --> 39:32.506
sticking by each other--

39:33.540 --> 39:35.809
Well, they were all
sticking by you in this,

39:35.842 --> 39:37.578
not me.

39:37.611 --> 39:39.445
Didn't you see that?

39:40.681 --> 39:42.516
I did.

39:43.684 --> 39:45.552
Don't leave us, Lucy.

39:46.753 --> 39:47.854
What we are...

39:48.955 --> 39:50.423
you're part of it.

39:51.825 --> 39:53.459
Don't leave.

39:58.965 --> 40:00.934
If I come back,

40:00.967 --> 40:02.669
I want to be made
full partner.

40:03.737 --> 40:04.738
How about senior partner?

40:04.771 --> 40:08.074
You made Rebecca partner
when she wasn't a lawyer.

40:08.108 --> 40:09.743
Don't think
I've forgotten that.

40:09.776 --> 40:11.612
Yeah, well, here's a tip--
forget it.

40:12.879 --> 40:15.081
The timing was right
for me to try.

40:17.818 --> 40:19.553
I am sorry.

40:21.254 --> 40:22.823
All right,
I'll come back

40:22.856 --> 40:25.692
for Ellenor and Eugene
and everyone else.

40:25.726 --> 40:27.027
You can still work on me.

40:28.094 --> 40:29.663
Deal.

40:30.797 --> 40:33.499
And, uh, we will be
revisiting the partner issue.

40:33.534 --> 40:35.501
In your lifetime,
not mine.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.738
The place would be better
with me in charge.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.573
You're already in charge.

40:54.588 --> 40:55.756
It's not unprecedented

40:55.789 --> 40:58.992
to get a murder two converted
to manslaughter at sentencing.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.228
It's a long shot,
but we did it once.

41:02.262 --> 41:04.164
I'm going to do the research.

41:04.898 --> 41:07.801
Also, you might
have grounds on appeal--

41:07.834 --> 41:09.269
the judge not letting me off,

41:09.302 --> 41:10.737
you and I were
so incompatible.

41:10.771 --> 41:13.239
It could be
reversible error--

41:13.273 --> 41:16.076
Another long shot.
In the meantime,

41:16.109 --> 41:17.277
I've ordered up
the transcripts

41:17.310 --> 41:19.746
to see if I can find
anything else.

41:21.715 --> 41:22.716
Why?

41:23.650 --> 41:25.652
You were court-appointed.
You did your job.

41:27.253 --> 41:28.522
Well...

41:28.555 --> 41:29.656
got to see it through,

41:29.690 --> 41:31.658
be professional about it.

41:33.059 --> 41:35.061
I'll let you know, okay?

41:36.730 --> 41:37.864
Okay.

41:40.734 --> 41:41.768
Thank you.

42:26.046 --> 42:29.082
(music playing)

42:52.138 --> 42:53.273
You stinker!
