00:15.598 --> 00:17.933
I can't… How do you?

00:18.018 --> 00:21.228
Where's the entrance? Is it not?

00:30.447 --> 00:33.198
<i>Into the camera. Hello.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:38.662
<i>My name. Right.</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:42.666
<i>My name is Marni Olivia Olsen,</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.919
<i>and I'm a senior
here at Ridgefield High.</i>

00:47.756 --> 00:51.782
<i>What's life like for a
<i>high school student in 2002?</i></i>

00:52.594 --> 00:55.306
<i>Well, for starters, my initials spell…</i>

00:55.346 --> 00:58.182
<i>Moo!</i>

00:58.266 --> 00:59.586
<i>Life is hard.</i>

01:04.730 --> 01:07.899
<i>With a little luck,
you'll rise above it.</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:44.353
<i>Unfortunately,
I never had much luck.</i>

01:49.025 --> 01:50.734
<i>Not even a little.</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:54.991
<i>Dating all the way back
to my freshman year…</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:57.449
Sorry. Saved.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.705
Sorry. Saved.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.503
<i>I come from a small town
in Northern California,</i>

02:06.543 --> 02:09.380
<i>and in a school as small as mine…</i>
–Oh, sorry. Saved.

02:09.419 --> 02:12.383
<i>there's always one person
that is so famous</i>

02:12.423 --> 02:15.129
<i>that they outshine all the others.</i>

02:20.515 --> 02:25.060
<i>In my class, I was that person.</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:27.023
–Were you on the squad last year?
–Shh!

02:27.063 --> 02:29.818
All right, ladies,
let's do this! Here we go!

02:29.858 --> 02:32.276
Five, six, seven and eight.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.487
And one, cross two, three, four,

02:35.572 --> 02:38.657
five, turn, six, seven and eight. Kick!

02:38.741 --> 02:41.827
All right, let's go this time.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.665
–Good luck, girls!
–Big smiles! Here we go!

02:43.705 --> 02:46.248
Five, six, seven and eight. And one…

02:46.332 --> 02:48.545
<i>I read somewhere that
who you are in high school</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:50.713
<i>determines who you'll be
for the rest of your life.</i>

02:50.753 --> 02:54.214
Kick!

02:54.757 --> 02:57.661
<i>I seriously hope that's not the case.</i>

02:58.595 --> 03:01.141
<i>Then again, the odds
aren't exactly in my favor.</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:03.491
<i>That's my big brother, Will.</i>

03:03.516 --> 03:06.894
<i>He's the greatest.
At, like, everything.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:12.357
Let's go, Gators, let's go!

03:15.528 --> 03:17.196
Out of my way!

03:18.573 --> 03:20.240
Go, go, Gators!

03:20.325 --> 03:24.328
Go, go, go, Gators!
Go, go, go, Gators!

03:35.173 --> 03:36.590
Nice work, Gator!

03:36.674 --> 03:40.385
P.S, you were prettier
with the mask on.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.856
Are you speaking to me yet?

04:04.744 --> 04:07.186
I'm not in the mood right now, Marni.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.336
I just wanted you to know
that I'm really sorry.

04:11.376 --> 04:16.338
And those girls are right.
I am a loser. You know?

04:16.422 --> 04:19.632
–Whoa, whoa. Which girls?
–What? No.

04:19.716 --> 04:22.305
No, no, no, no. Who called you a loser,
Marni? I'll talk to them right now.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.973
–Who called you a loser?
–Doesn't matter, Will.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.641
You can't always protect me from it.
It's true.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.149
I wish you could see how
incredible you are, Marni.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.486
You just have to believe in yourself,
'cause once you do that,

04:36.526 --> 04:39.496
you're gonna be able
to do anything you want.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.493
<i>And, of course, Will was right.</i>

04:43.533 --> 04:47.747
<i>Once I changed the way I saw myself,
the past was history.</i>

04:47.787 --> 04:49.874
<i>I ditched the braces, I got contacts</i>

04:49.914 --> 04:54.336
<i>and I started spending more
than eight dollars on a haircut.</i>

04:55.253 --> 04:57.757
I've come a long way
since those horrible days.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.928
But if it weren't for the determination
of that little girl from Ridgefield,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.597
the woman standing in front of you
wouldn't be here today,

05:04.637 --> 05:07.684
working at one of the top
PR firms in Los Angeles,

05:07.724 --> 05:10.687
telling a bunch of
junior publicists about the days

05:10.727 --> 05:13.829
when I was the poster child
for the geek squad.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.902
You can't control the things
that happen to you,

05:17.942 --> 05:21.153
but you can control
the way you react to them.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.779
It's all perception.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.199
That is what public relations
is all about.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.414
Thank you.
And good luck.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.045
–Nice job.
–Thank you.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.968
Great speech. Inspiring.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.221
Thank you, sir, very much.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.560
Now, I'm gonna need you
to pack up your office.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.062
What? Did… Did you just say
that I need to pack up my office?

05:55.146 --> 05:58.523
–That's right.
–But I only asked for two days off,

05:58.608 --> 06:00.852
and it's for my brother's wedding.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.405
There's an opening
in the New York office.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.742
VP. It's yours.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.955
It… You…

06:14.040 --> 06:16.541
I… The VP for…

06:16.626 --> 06:19.172
Unless, of course, you have
a problem with a huge promotion.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.799
No, I don't!
I certainly do not. I don't.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.843
–Thank you, sir!
–You've earned it.

06:30.765 --> 06:34.059
I am excited to see everyone, too, Mom.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.564
I can't believe how quickly
this all came together.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.357
I know, and it's gonna be so beautiful.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.696
Joanna's Aunt Mona is spending
a fortune for this wedding.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.657
I tried to get in touch with her
to say I thought it was too much,

06:46.697 --> 06:48.657
and I got back a text saying,

06:48.741 --> 06:51.537
<i>“Happy to do it,
can't wait to meet you all.”</i>

06:51.577 --> 06:54.290
<i>I just feel bad
that I haven't met Joanna yet.</i>

06:54.330 --> 06:56.456
I know. Isn't it funny?

06:56.541 --> 06:59.712
You guys all went to high school
together, you don't know each other.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.298
Wait, we all went
to high school together?

07:02.338 --> 07:03.383
I thought you knew.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.219
No. Well, all Will did
was send me a picture,

07:06.259 --> 07:09.514
but she didn't look familiar.
Ridgefield High was really small.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.973
I don't remember a Joanna.

07:11.013 --> 07:14.185
<i>That's because she didn't
go by Joanna in high school.</i>

07:14.225 --> 07:15.937
<i>She went by a nickname.</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:18.728
Oh… Uh…

07:19.522 --> 07:20.480
Deedee.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.859
–Deedee?
<i>–No, um…</i>

07:23.943 --> 07:25.819
–Titi?
–Titi?

07:25.903 --> 07:29.489
No… I can't believe
I'm blanking on this.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.704
–JJ?
<i>–That's it! JJ!</i>

07:35.788 --> 07:37.372
<i>Joanna, JJ, yeah!</i>

07:43.421 --> 07:45.046
No!

07:45.131 --> 07:49.259
No! No!

07:51.345 --> 07:52.804
No. Nope.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.019
Ma'am? “Fasten your seat belt” sign's
on. I need you to return to your seat.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.230
–Mom, are you telling me Will is…
–Shh!

07:59.270 --> 08:02.400
Please! I've listened to you talk about
how your “cats are just like people”

08:02.440 --> 08:05.486
for the last 45 minutes.
–Ma'am, you must remain seated.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.781
–It's for your own safety.
–Mom, hold on one second.

08:08.821 --> 08:14.701
I'm sorry… Heather.
Um… This is an emergency.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.998
My brother is about to marry the girl

08:17.038 --> 08:19.250
who single-handedly
ruined my life in high school.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.524
So, if you don't mind,
would you please back off?

08:23.294 --> 08:26.528
–Sorry, Mom. I…
–I'm sorry, do we have a problem?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.734
I don't know, do we have a problem?

08:30.801 --> 08:33.639
Is your brother marrying
your arch nemesis?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.683
So you didn't know
it was the same girl?

08:36.724 --> 08:38.725
Nobody knew.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.313
My brother was a senior
when I was a sophomore.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.776
I can't blame him for not keeping up
with my high school soap opera.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.317
Pretzel?

08:49.612 --> 08:52.116
There are seven billion
people on this planet,

08:52.156 --> 08:56.284
and I get stuck with
Satan's spawn as my sister-in-law.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.788
She is the reason
I left home in the first place.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.457
Marni, let me tell you about bullies.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.766
They're just like terrorists,
only they're emotional terrorists.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.508
You can never let them
get the upper hand,

09:08.548 --> 09:11.052
so the best thing that you can do
in this situation is remain calm

09:11.092 --> 09:13.262
and show her that you are in control.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.390
Besides, I don't care if the Ridgefield
mascot getting ploughed got over

09:16.430 --> 09:17.558
a thousand hits on YouTube.
–A million.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.935
–A million hits?
–Yeah.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.728
Wow, you gotta get me that link.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.894
–Will do.
–The bottom line is,

09:22.979 --> 09:24.774
things have changed since then.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.576
You need to go back,
and you show JJ what you're made of.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.656
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just overreacting.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.197
Hey. You got this.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.283
–I have got this.
–You got it.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.082
Oh! There she is!

09:44.166 --> 09:48.670
–Oh, my little girl is home!
–Hi.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.507
Oh, sweetheart,
four months is too long!

09:52.592 --> 09:54.801
–Hey.
–Hi. Why are you so tall?

09:54.885 --> 09:57.974
Look at you! You look so great!
And we miss you so much.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.977
–I miss you guys, too.
–Oh, yeah? Well, not as much

10:01.017 --> 10:03.396
as you're about to miss shotgun.
–In your dreams.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.520
–Ben!
–What, Mom?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.856
Joanna always lets me sit shotgun.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.361
You guys do a lot of stuff with Joanna?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.071
We do everything with Joanna.

10:12.111 --> 10:16.075
We don't do everything…
Take your sister's bag, be a gentleman.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.200
You're home!

10:26.584 --> 10:29.419
Mark! Honey, she's home!

10:29.503 --> 10:30.503
Oh!

10:30.588 --> 10:32.341
Ben, will you get the phone, please?

10:32.381 --> 10:35.091
–Yeah, sure.
–Coco Puff!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.804
–Come here, buddy! Coco!
–Sweetheart…

10:36.844 --> 10:38.848
Joanna took Coco to the groomer's.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.475
Everybody needs to look
their best for this wedding,

10:41.515 --> 10:44.976
including Coco Puff.
Hey, Mark, she's home!

10:47.938 --> 10:50.234
Hey, babe.
We're a full house this weekend.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.361
You and Joanna are gonna have
to bunk in, I hope you don't mind.

10:52.401 --> 10:56.029
–Oh, come on, Mom!
–Oh, Marni Olivia Olsen.

10:56.113 --> 11:00.411
OK. It will just be like the
slumber party I was never invited to.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.453
I'm gonna get dinner.
Honey! She's home!

11:21.931 --> 11:25.100
–Busted!
–Oh, you scared me!

11:25.184 --> 11:26.228
–There he is!
–Come here!

11:26.268 --> 11:28.687
Ridgefield's legal golden boy!

11:28.771 --> 11:30.941
–Look at you. You look gorgeous.
–Thank you.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.028
Can you believe this? Because, Marni,
it wasn't that long ago, you remember?

11:34.068 --> 11:36.989
We were kids up in that tree house,
swearing we'd never get married.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.033
–Hm-hm.
–I guess some things change, huh?

11:39.073 --> 11:42.244
–I'm counting on it.
–Is that my little mover and shaker?

11:42.284 --> 11:45.036
–Oh, baby.
–Hi, Daddy! Hi.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.333
Oh, my gosh, you look great!
You're so thin!

11:47.373 --> 11:50.461
I have lost a couple of pounds.
Thank you for noticing.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.962
–You look fantastic.
–Thanks.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.924
Joanna's back. Your mom wants
everyone downstairs. Chop-chop!

11:54.964 --> 11:59.092
One of those. Off to the side.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.138
And, while rolling, it is
so crucial to have one inch wide

12:03.222 --> 12:08.560
and nine inches in length.
And you finish it just like that.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.061
Oh…

12:11.105 --> 12:16.192
–You are a culinary wonder.
–Hey, hey. Look who I found.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.378
Marni, Marni, Marni.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.551
Look at you!

12:41.635 --> 12:47.474
–You are so beautiful!
–Thank you?

12:47.558 --> 12:50.938
Do you know that I have waited
so long for this moment?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.270
It's finally here.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.734
You think you waited long? 'Cause I…

12:54.774 --> 12:58.359
–There's just so much to say.
–Believe me, I know.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.531
But I don't want to do it
in front of them.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.573
But first, let me just say

13:03.657 --> 13:06.409
how nice it is to finally…
–It's OK.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.453
Meet you!

13:09.955 --> 13:12.626
–Excuse me?
–Will has told me so much about you,

13:12.666 --> 13:16.630
but now here you are! I cannot
wait to spend the next four days

13:16.670 --> 13:21.341
learning all about my
brand-new sister! Hugsies!

13:24.053 --> 13:26.930
–Oh, never mind.
–Yeah.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.724
The salad looks good.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.478
There he is!

13:33.562 --> 13:35.772
Coco Puff! Come here, buddy!

13:35.856 --> 13:40.610
Oh, Coco Puff! Come to Mommy!

13:40.694 --> 13:44.989
–Yeah! That's my boy.
–Coco Puff, dinner time.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.870
Joanna, I'm not sure I feel comfortable
starting dinner without your aunt.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.663
–I think it's very rude.
–Oh, no, no, no.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.624
Don't worry about Aunt Mona.
She's just running late.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.209
–OK. You ready, honey?
–Ready!

13:53.249 --> 13:54.635
All right. Batter up.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.671
I'm sorry, are we executing Dad tonight?

13:57.711 --> 14:00.216
You know how your father's
always been so interested

14:00.256 --> 14:02.632
in the whole mind-body connection?

14:02.716 --> 14:05.554
And since we can't have Will's
best man looking fat on Saturday…

14:05.594 --> 14:07.264
–That's right.
–You do not look fat!

14:07.304 --> 14:08.891
I'm trying the Yamaguchi diet.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.518
A colleague at the hospital
told me about it.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.770
Most people don't realize
when they're full.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.231
They need an empty plate to tell them.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.189
When you wear a blindfold,

14:18.274 --> 14:21.403
you rely on your stomach.
I've already lost six pounds.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.447
And where did you go to medical school?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.196
–Ben!
–Well, I think it's

14:25.281 --> 14:26.659
a very smart way to stay fit.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.118
–Thank you, Joanna.
–Mm-hmm.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.450
Let's eat!

14:32.204 --> 14:36.332
Wow.
So, uh, how did you two meet?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.380
We were at this little
karaoke bar at the beach,

14:39.420 --> 14:43.089
and Will was onstage
doing his best Hall & Oates.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.969
–Not my finest moment.
–Really?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.427
–No, it wasn't.
–Ben.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.932
He was so cute, I just had to save him.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.807
So I got onstage
and we sang it together.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.855
–And she has been saving me ever since.
–That's right.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.650
You know, I just think it's unbelievable
that in a small town like Ridgefield,

14:59.690 --> 15:01.774
Will and Joanna could grow up

15:01.859 --> 15:03.863
practically down the block
from each other

15:03.903 --> 15:06.740
and not run into each other until now.
It's funny, isn't it?

15:06.780 --> 15:08.156
It's hilarious!

15:11.160 --> 15:16.414
Isn't it? I mean, that
our paths haven't crossed till now?

15:16.498 --> 15:20.084
–Isn't that funny?
–Yeah. It's so funny!

15:21.420 --> 15:24.714
Weird. So, Marni, Will tells me

15:24.840 --> 15:28.176
that you work for this
big, fancy PR firm in LA?

15:29.845 --> 15:34.349
Guilty. Actually, since you
mentioned it, I have news.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.392
–I got a promotion.
–What?

15:36.477 --> 15:39.356
And I am now VP of our
New York office. And I was…

15:39.396 --> 15:41.981
–A promotion in New York?
–Yes.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.612
Oh, honey, congratulations!
That's fantastic!

15:44.652 --> 15:46.488
–We're so proud of you!
–That is awesome.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.825
You get to meet real celebrities?
Like, that is really cool!

15:49.865 --> 15:51.741
You know, enough about me.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.371
I'm dying to know
what you're doing. You know?

15:54.411 --> 15:55.748
I mean, what have you been up to?

15:55.788 --> 16:01.000
–My life is dull by comparison.
–Oh, I doubt it.

16:01.085 --> 16:05.174
I'm sure you keep it just as interesting
as you did in high school, right?

16:05.214 --> 16:09.438
I mean, I'd love to hear how your
wonderful life has turned out.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.888
–Well, um…
–Yeah.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.432
Yeah. After my parents died,

16:16.517 --> 16:20.478
I took a hard look at my life,
and realized I wasn't

16:20.562 --> 16:25.316
really making the right choices.
So I enrolled in nursing school,

16:25.401 --> 16:30.285
and I decided to focus all of my energy
into helping those less fortunate.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.199
Wow. Good… Good for you.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.205
No, “good” doesn't even
begin to describe it.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.208
Yeah, I kind of became obsessed
with helping people in need.

16:39.248 --> 16:43.418
Well, since, Will and I love children.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.260
As an entry-level RN, they
promoted me to head clinical nurse.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.929
I tried to put in a good word.
She wouldn't let me.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.430
–Oh, Dad.
–Oh, Dad.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.559
Between the hospital…
Yeah, it, actually…

16:57.599 --> 17:00.018
It helps build the self-esteem of…

17:00.102 --> 17:03.232
Let's be honest, you can only
run a suicide hotline so long

17:03.272 --> 17:05.275
before it starts to take its toll.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.403
–Do you still have that number?
–Ben!

17:07.443 --> 17:10.364
Oh, my gosh, I have been
talking about myself way too much.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.407
–No, no, no. Baby, it's fine. Trust me.
–I, for one,

17:12.448 --> 17:17.242
had no idea you were such a…
giver.

17:17.327 --> 17:21.875
I know, right? I'm so proud of her.
I'm so proud to call you my bride.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.126
Oh! Bride! He said it again!

17:25.210 --> 17:28.796
Gail! He's getting married! I know!

17:29.506 --> 17:33.217
–I really need a refill.
–He has been saying bride.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.806
–Today, I think it's 16…
–Anybody need anything?

17:35.846 --> 17:39.265
–How many more days?
–Does anybody want anything?

17:39.349 --> 17:42.477
–Of course we will. But…
–Great.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.645
Oh, my gosh!

17:51.862 --> 17:53.529
The Lambada!

17:54.656 --> 17:57.784
Jeez, Mom, you scared me!

17:57.868 --> 18:02.747
–So that Joanna's pretty great, right?
–Yeah, almost too good to be true.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.461
I think so, too.
I think it's her sweetness.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.837
You know, her genuine warmth.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.838
–Uh, where is the recycling?
–Oh! Come with me, please.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.759
There's the recycling, and…

18:16.345 --> 18:18.554
Wow, this looks beautiful.

18:18.639 --> 18:22.183
–Maybe Joanna could sleep out here.
–Marni.

18:23.352 --> 18:28.439
Listen. How come you
didn't mention New York?

18:28.524 --> 18:31.153
I'm really proud of you.
That's fantastic.

18:31.193 --> 18:35.279
Thank you. I don't know.
I think I've just been preoccupied

18:35.364 --> 18:40.785
with the whole… Joanna thing, and…

18:40.869 --> 18:43.040
Don't you think it's odd
that she doesn't remember me?

18:43.080 --> 18:45.167
Ridgefield High was not that big.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.836
I don't remember half the people
I went to high school with.

18:47.876 --> 18:52.130
Yeah, but you're Gail Byer.
Everyone loved you.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.009
You can't relate to what I went through.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.467
Really? You wanna bet?

18:56.552 --> 19:00.724
Listen, nobody gets through
high school unscathed, Marni. Nobody.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.769
You didn't tell me
you had problems in high school.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.727
Because what's past is past.

19:06.812 --> 19:11.607
Look, if you had a problem with Joanna
in the past, you can fix it now.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.984
Remember…

19:13.068 --> 19:17.688
–Everyone deserves a second chance.
–Deserves a second chance. I know.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.951
Joanna's Aunt Mona is here!

19:22.035 --> 19:25.165
I can't believe my
little Joanna's getting married.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.292
–I know. It's crazy, right?
–I'm so happy for you.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.293
Come meet the family. Aunt Mona…

19:35.257 --> 19:36.802
this is Will's sister, Marni.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.637
–What a pleasure.
–Nice to meet you.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.845
And this is Will's mom.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.266
–Gail?
–Ramona.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.396
Whoa! You guys know each other?

19:50.856 --> 19:54.066
–Gail!
–Ramona!

19:58.030 --> 20:00.031
How long has it been?

20:00.115 --> 20:03.217
Well, don't tell, or I'll have
to strangle you.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.173
–Who can remember?
–How do you two know each other?

20:14.213 --> 20:18.174
–Uh… we went to school together.
–We were best friends.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.469
–Whoa!
–Very, very close.

20:21.553 --> 20:27.350
Wow. You look… great.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.435
–Stop.
–No, no, really.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.065
You look amazing.
You haven't aged at all.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.401
–Oh, well…
–She looks computer-generated.

20:34.441 --> 20:38.402
–Ben.
–Thank you. You must be Ben.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.406
You know, I have something
that I think you will like.

20:45.535 --> 20:49.124
<i>Fallout Four? This doesn't</i>
even come out until the summer!

20:49.164 --> 20:51.376
–What do you say, young man?
–Thank you!

20:51.416 --> 20:54.585
Oh!

20:54.670 --> 20:57.674
I cannot wait to go play this!
I got… I gotta go!

20:57.714 --> 21:01.092
Have fun.
Oh, and Marni.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.303
You know, I think I have the right size.

21:06.848 --> 21:10.142
–Is this Brian Reyes?
–Brian who?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.855
And this is from his new collection?

21:11.895 --> 21:14.149
'Cause I thought
that it was pre-sold out.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.610
Brian is a doll.
He always stays at my hotels.

21:16.650 --> 21:20.820
He always stays at the Sullenger.
You own the Sullenger Hotel?

21:20.904 --> 21:24.368
The Sullenger Group.
Actually, we now own 14 properties.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.953
I can't believe it myself.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.497
I can't believe
that my mom didn't tell me

21:28.537 --> 21:32.292
that she was friends with one of
Forbes' 100 most powerful women.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.670
Please, that silly list
changes all the time.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.546
Yeah, but you've been on it
for, like, ten years.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.840
Eleven. But, you know,
what's most important to me

21:38.880 --> 21:42.219
is that when someone stays at my hotel,
they feel right at home.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.928
“Like home but better,” I always say.
Which reminds me…

21:46.013 --> 21:49.056
You two have worked
so hard on this wedding.

21:49.141 --> 21:53.272
It would mean so much to me if you would
spend a week at any one of my resorts.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.147
Bali, Maui, Paris.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.609
–Are you? Yes!
–No. No.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.275
–Yes.
–I insist.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.571
Now, Ramona, you know
you did not have to do all this.

22:01.611 --> 22:02.781
You've already done
so much for the wedding.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.075
Do you think I'm trying
to buy people's affection?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.158
–Did it work?
–Yeah!

22:07.242 --> 22:12.371
This is so exciting. I mean, doesn't
it feel like we're already family?

22:12.456 --> 22:15.085
Let's not just stand here.
Come on in, family!

22:15.125 --> 22:17.699
Put your feet up.
Have a drink, Ramona.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.590
I think we've got
some French champagne.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.802
There are cowbells on every door,
and we have no beds.

22:23.842 --> 22:27.472
I have 400 beds stranded
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.640
I mean, it's still beautiful.
It's Switzerland.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.187
–I love Switzerland.
–You've never been to Switzerland.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.899
Yeah, but I love chocolate.
I love cheese. I love clocks!

22:37.939 --> 22:41.486
Well, then we all have to
spend some time at my new place.

22:41.526 --> 22:45.363
–How about Christmas in Gstaad?
–Yes!

22:45.447 --> 22:47.159
–We can take the jet.
–Count me in.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.742
No way! You own your own plane?

22:49.826 --> 22:52.787
Oh, darling,
sometimes I think it owns me.

22:52.871 --> 22:57.583
I am on it non-stop just flitting
from one continent to the next.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.422
Not to mention all the
back-and-forth with my divorce.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.256
Michael and I have been
in litigation 14 months.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.651
We were only married for seven, so…

23:06.718 --> 23:09.514
Ramona, I'm sorry.
That must be so difficult.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.514
Yeah, it is, but, you know,

23:11.640 --> 23:15.996
it's nothing that a delicious piece
of whatever this is can't fix.

23:18.271 --> 23:21.571
Oh, Mark has been doing
this kind of program that…

23:22.192 --> 23:26.112
“As the eyes are the
window to the stomach…

23:28.323 --> 23:30.950
so shall we pull the curtain.”

23:31.034 --> 23:32.371
How did you know that?

23:32.411 --> 23:36.497
I had no idea the Yamaguchi Diet
had come to the States!

23:36.581 --> 23:39.333
–I simply swear by it!
–Me, too!

23:39.793 --> 23:42.128
Oh!

23:44.172 --> 23:49.760
Hello. Hello, darling.
Georgia King, the wedding planner.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.474
Geor… Georgia King
is the wedding planner?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.849
She is like Southern royalty.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.521
Every single one of our clients
wants her to do their wedding.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.980
Thank you, darling.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.315
Look at these two.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.901
You guys are so adorable.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.449
Gail, doesn't that just take you
right back to when you were young?

24:09.489 --> 24:13.870
You know, your mother may not have
told you this, but back in high school,

24:13.910 --> 24:17.541
she was quite the superstar.
–Oh, no, she told us. I mean, we know.

24:17.581 --> 24:22.501
–I… was hardly a superstar.
–Oh, you were a supernova.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.673
Every girl wanted
to be just like your mother.

24:24.713 --> 24:29.467
She was prom queen. She was
homecoming queen. Cheerleading captain.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.263
Well, not all at the same time.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.680
Wait. You were cheerleading
captain at Ridgefield?

24:34.764 --> 24:36.768
Mm-hmm. My senior year, I was varsity.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.267
–Me, too!
–Joanna!

24:38.351 --> 24:40.439
I was cheerleading captain
at Ridgefield!

24:40.479 --> 24:42.521
How come I didn't know that?

24:42.606 --> 24:45.708
Joanna, have you ever heard of the…
Byer Flyer?

24:45.734 --> 24:48.864
Well, yeah, I mean, it's the
signature move of the varsity squad.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.529
Yeah?

24:52.032 --> 24:54.617
You were the “Byer” in the Byer Flyer?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.288
I mean, I originated the move.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.330
Oh, my gosh! Your mother is a legend!

24:59.414 --> 25:01.751
Oh, I'm not a legend. I'm not a legend.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.921
–Gator Power. Let's do it!
–Oh, no, no. They still do it?

25:04.961 --> 25:07.883
–Go, Gators! Go, go, go, Gators!
–I haven't done it in 30 years!

25:07.923 --> 25:10.385
Dad, can I please
borrow your blindfold?

25:10.425 --> 25:12.220
–Come on! Go, go, Gators!
–Get in line.

25:12.260 --> 25:16.263
Go, go, go, Gators! Go, go, go, Gators!

25:16.348 --> 25:18.393
No, I haven't done it
in such a long time!

25:18.433 --> 25:23.437
–Go, go, go, Gators!
–Go, go, Gators! Go, go, go, Gators!

25:24.272 --> 25:26.357
Ready? OK!

25:26.441 --> 25:28.984
Ridgefield Gators are out tonight.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.865
We're gonna dribble
and fight, fight, fight!

25:31.905 --> 25:35.032
–Yeah!
–Snap those jaws, let's begin.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.496
Ridgefield Gators gonna win, win, win!

25:37.536 --> 25:41.455
Go… Gators!

25:45.168 --> 25:49.296
–Unbelievable!
–I haven't done that in 30 years!

25:49.381 --> 25:52.466
–Oh!
–Boy, the two of you together again.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.138
Must feel like you're
right back at Ridgefield High.

25:55.178 --> 25:58.931
Oh, yes, it feels…
just like old times.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.684
–Whoo! Gator Power!
–Mom!

26:01.768 --> 26:03.727
–Yeah!
–Whoo!

26:07.190 --> 26:10.695
–All I want is an apology.
–You can't prove it was me.

26:10.735 --> 26:16.407
I suppose I should
commend Joanna for changing her life

26:16.491 --> 26:21.120
and just do what Mom says
and forget about it and move on.

26:21.204 --> 26:26.625
Yeah. You know, that's probably a good
idea. I mean, you two are roommates now.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.587
Ben!

26:29.671 --> 26:31.589
–Thank you.
–Let me help you.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.216
How gallant.

26:36.177 --> 26:39.179
You know, Joanna is my
only family now, and…

26:40.432 --> 26:43.812
it's been hard to imagine this
wedding without her parents here.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.690
–Of course.
–So it means the world to me to be able

26:46.730 --> 26:48.775
to share it with you
and your beautiful family.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.531
It means a lot to us, too.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.571
–Good night.
–Good night, Ramona.

26:58.908 --> 27:04.288
–Well, that was normal. Right?
–Yeah. You seem surprised.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.752
–You two were friends, weren't you?
–Yeah, we were best friends.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.546
Yeah, all the way
through grade school,

27:09.586 --> 27:12.379
and then we were close in high school.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.257
Right up until our senior prom, and…

27:15.383 --> 27:20.012
then she… she kind of
had a little breakdown,

27:20.096 --> 27:22.640
and something happened, and I…

27:22.724 --> 27:24.227
She said she never
wanted to see me again.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.769
I don't know what happened, really.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.189
Honey, it was…
That's a long time ago.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.817
And you always say
everyone deserves a second chance.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.618
So stop worrying about it.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.199
You honestly don't
remember me from high school?

27:38.239 --> 27:39.990
Uh…

27:40.492 --> 27:43.494
No, I… I'm so sorry.

27:43.578 --> 27:47.915
High school was such a blur.
Please don't take it personally.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.670
Slumber party!
Oh, look at you two.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.507
Now, I'm not interrupting
any pillow fights, am I?

27:56.591 --> 27:59.426
–Not yet.
–I just came to say goodnight

27:59.511 --> 28:01.470
to my lady.

28:01.554 --> 28:04.098
–My favorite!
–Yeah?

28:04.182 --> 28:07.518
–Does that smell good?
–Don't you just love this?

28:07.602 --> 28:09.384
I'll give you two a minute.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.786
Wow. Love what
you've done with the place.

28:27.330 --> 28:33.043
Oh, my curtains!
Did you know I made those from scratch?

28:33.128 --> 28:36.494
Uh, yeah. I thought you said
you were going to bed.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.093
My room is a little crowded right now.

28:41.177 --> 28:45.203
I thought I would just hang up here
with you, if that's cool.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.975
Yeah. It's cool.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.478
Thanks.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.819
I thought you said his sister was hot.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.240
Oh, I accept.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.830
–Mark, do you remember Denmark?
–Of course I do.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.123
–Yeah.
–I was there.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.291
I know. Do you remember
the room service?

29:10.331 --> 29:12.374
No, I really don't.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.377
–Hey! Good morning, sunshine.
–Hey.

29:15.462 --> 29:19.047
Oh, Coco Puff, there's my boy!

29:19.966 --> 29:23.886
Coco Puff, no!
We do not growl at guests.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.680
I am so sorry. He'll warm up to you.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.391
He probably just doesn't recognize you.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.810
Yeah. I get that a lot.

29:32.896 --> 29:36.023
Check it out, Marni. The Hawaii trip.

29:36.107 --> 29:39.154
Remember when you got nailed
in the face by that baby octopus.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.070
You were like…
It wouldn't come off!

29:42.197 --> 29:46.091
She was so sad. She was so brave,
though. She was so brave.

29:47.494 --> 29:52.372
–Let's turn the page.
–Um, hello, we need to go right now

29:52.457 --> 29:54.544
because we have a lot to do
before our dance lesson.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.213
–Dance lesson?
–If the bride and groom want dancing,

29:57.253 --> 29:59.257
we're gonna give them dancing. Hey!

29:59.297 --> 30:01.426
That means you need
to pick up Grandma.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.908
Oh, honey, she can't wait to see you.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.347
–Come on, Coco. Let's go.
–She really can't.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.184
That was all she would talk about
the other day at the mall, Marni.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.852
You go shopping with our grandma?

30:10.892 --> 30:13.938
Oh, yeah. Bunny and I,
we're like sorority sisters.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.775
All right, ladies, come on. We're
wastin' time. Let's go. Let's do it.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.316
Yes!
I'm so excited about our dance.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.401
Come on, Marni. Chop-chop.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.364
Marni, seriously, don't worry about it.

30:23.404 --> 30:28.486
You'll have plenty of time to wash up
before my bridal shower this afternoon.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.746
So, Will, how'd you pop the question?

30:34.040 --> 30:36.711
I… I proposed in
the tree house, actually.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.669
–Our tree house?
–Uh-huh.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.340
It's my wedding gift to Joanna.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.383
I'm having it moved from
Mom and Dad's to our new place,

30:42.423 --> 30:44.636
once it's finally built.
–You're moving the tree?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.221
You can't move the tree house, Will.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.890
You and I built that with Dad
with our bare hands.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.809
–That's like Olsen family history.
–OK, Marni, how about

30:50.849 --> 30:53.686
when you come in town,
you can come visit it at our place.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.686
OK? How's that?

30:55.770 --> 30:58.230
Honey, our song! It's fate.

30:58.314 --> 30:59.356
Oh!

31:15.498 --> 31:19.084
Stop!

31:23.548 --> 31:27.467
Sorry. I thought that
plastic bag was a kitten.

31:29.178 --> 31:32.389
–What?
–Check it out. Ridgefield High.

31:32.473 --> 31:36.351
So many… fond memories.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.275
But, you know,
if I knew then what I know now,

31:40.315 --> 31:43.027
I would've done a lot
of things differently.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.986
How about you, Joanna? Any regrets?

31:46.070 --> 31:49.114
Well, actually, yeah.

31:49.198 --> 31:52.328
I mean, if I could start
all over, I would probably

31:52.368 --> 31:56.291
get a head start on my community service
and charitable outreach programs.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.497
Huh.

31:58.207 --> 32:03.421
I would've had a boyfriend. You probably
had lots of boyfriends, right, Joanna?

32:03.922 --> 32:07.969
–No, I wouldn't say “lots.”
–I heard that one of the cheerleaders

32:08.009 --> 32:10.680
had a different boyfriend
in each school in the district,

32:10.720 --> 32:14.309
and that when she'd bleed one dry,
she'd just move on to the next one.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.145
Hey, Joanna, you were
on the cheerleading squad.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.688
Do you remember who that was?

32:18.728 --> 32:21.188
–What's your point, Marni?
–No point.

32:21.314 --> 32:25.945
Just wondered if she remembered who
this low self-esteem gold-digger was.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.573
I heard she even dated the Wilson
High School principal for a while.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.821
She did not!

32:34.077 --> 32:38.205
I mean, that's just a rumor I heard
that Judy Karbash made up

32:38.289 --> 32:41.333
because she was jealous
of said cheerleader.

32:41.417 --> 32:44.670
Do you guys mind
if I change the music?

33:00.269 --> 33:03.635
Love this song!
Don't you guys just love this song?

33:43.104 --> 33:44.771
Joanna!

33:51.237 --> 33:55.741
I said, “"Cougar?" I'm old enough
to be your grandmother!”

33:58.286 --> 34:02.417
Well, we better get going if we wanna
make it on time for our dance lesson.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.252
Bunny, can I help you get ready?

34:04.292 --> 34:06.087
–That would be delightful.
–OK.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.339
You know what? You've done enough.
I'll help her get ready.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.591
Don't be silly. I'm happy
to help Grandma Bunny.

34:10.630 --> 34:15.342
Well, she's my Grandma Bunny, by blood.
I've got this.

34:15.428 --> 34:18.472
They're fighting over me.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.768
So, Grandma, is there
anything I can help you with?

34:21.809 --> 34:25.145
Here, dear. They were a little loose.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.567
We can't have them
falling out on the dance floor.

34:27.607 --> 34:31.487
–I don't think… I don't know how.
–They're just dentures! Get over it.

34:31.527 --> 34:34.154
Now, and be sure and press hard, dear.

34:34.237 --> 34:37.699
We need a tight seal.
I might be kissing later.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.117
Oh!

34:39.202 --> 34:43.496
–OK.
–There we go. OK.

34:48.543 --> 34:51.670
–Oh, seriously?
–Oh, dear!

34:53.007 --> 34:55.342
I can fix that.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.428
–Now, hold still.
–Grandma, no!

35:02.725 --> 35:05.354
I really gotta give you credit.
You've got this whole good girl act

35:05.394 --> 35:07.704
down to a T, don't you?
–Excuse me?

35:07.730 --> 35:10.568
You even had me believing
that you didn't remember who I was.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.720
<i>But We Are The Champions?</i>

35:12.777 --> 35:15.698
You really showed your true colors,
didn't you, JJ?

35:15.738 --> 35:17.364
Joanna.

35:17.990 --> 35:20.033
Tim!

35:21.160 --> 35:23.829
Oh… Tim!

35:23.913 --> 35:28.583
–Wow! You look well!
–Thank you.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.711
Thank you for saying that. You… Wow.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.965
I wasn't expecting to see you.
What… how…

35:35.049 --> 35:37.261
Well, you look…
You changed your hair.

35:37.301 --> 35:41.346
No, I didn't, but Tim, this is Will,
Marni and Grandma Bunny.

35:41.430 --> 35:45.392
–We go way back.
–Way back. Seattle Space Needle.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.769
It was really great seeing you.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.065
–Oh, my gosh.
–It's awesome.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.359
I mean, but, unfortunately,
we've gotta get going. So…

35:51.399 --> 35:53.861
We don't need to rush. They're
not gonna start without you guys.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.531
Let's talk to Tim
and hear about way back.

35:56.571 --> 36:00.201
What is your phone number? Someone
keeps blocking your number on my phone.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.451
–I think it's a glitch.
–It's 555-0172.

36:03.536 --> 36:07.956
That's my cell. I'm also on Facebook.
And the Twitter.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.614
What about you, Joanna? Do you Twitter?

36:10.626 --> 36:13.172
Can we Twitter together?
You wanna, maybe… I have a pool.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.758
–You wanna catch a movie sometime?
–Oh, uh…

36:15.798 --> 36:18.592
Tim, Will and I are getting married.

36:18.968 --> 36:22.136
–I hadn't heard about this.
–Yup, this Saturday.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.890
–This Saturday?
–Hm-hm.

36:24.974 --> 36:28.268
That is great!
That is so soon for a marriage.

36:28.352 --> 36:31.521
That is so soon. Lovebirds.

36:31.606 --> 36:35.442
That is great.
Gotta give you one of these, then.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.282
Married to… And you're
sure that's this Saturday?

36:39.322 --> 36:43.909
Hey, man. Keep it real.
And you got a terrific girl here. Move.

36:46.287 --> 36:49.414
Bye, Tim. Call me!

36:49.498 --> 36:53.251
That was awkward.
We dated in college.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.756
Long story. Right.
We're not gonna go into that.

36:55.796 --> 36:58.506
–Let's go dance!
–You guys dated?

36:59.926 --> 37:02.510
Oh! Here they are. Hi!

37:02.637 --> 37:07.307
It's happening! Marni!
Did you get a haircut?

37:07.391 --> 37:13.313
You did. Let me see!
It's, um… It's cute.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.444
It's cute, bangs. You haven't
had bangs since high school.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.986
–I know.
–It's cute. How was Grandma's?

37:20.112 --> 37:25.533
It was fun… when Grandma wasn't
fawning all over her new BFF, Joanna.

37:25.618 --> 37:30.121
Honey. Your grandma loves you.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.627
Don't turn everything
into a competition.

37:32.667 --> 37:37.212
Hola, everyone! I am so sorry I'm late.

37:37.338 --> 37:41.341
Oh, look at this!

37:41.801 --> 37:44.597
Oh, Gail, when was the
last time we danced together?

37:44.637 --> 37:46.805
Could it have been… prom?

37:46.889 --> 37:49.266
Um…

37:49.350 --> 37:51.198
Is that what you're wearing?

37:52.186 --> 37:54.604
–Yes. Why?
–You know what I love

37:54.689 --> 37:57.399
about your look is it's so… sporty.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.567
–Thank you.
–So American.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.279
Ooh!

38:03.781 --> 38:07.495
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your wedding extraordinator,</i>

38:07.535 --> 38:11.329
<i>Miss Georgia King!</i>

38:31.309 --> 38:32.392
Hi!

38:37.440 --> 38:38.565
Whack!

38:53.039 --> 38:54.080
Oh!

38:55.916 --> 38:57.959
Heart!

39:02.923 --> 39:04.674
<i>–Brava.</i>
–Yes!

39:04.759 --> 39:09.637
<i>Oh… Bonjour. Guten tag. Hola.
Aloha. Konichiwa.</i>

39:09.764 --> 39:14.684
Hi, y'all. I'm Georgia King.
And I am your wedding extraordinator.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.800
And this lovely man
to my right is the owner

39:19.815 --> 39:24.277
of this Off-Broadway dance studio,
and my personal helper, Timothy.

39:25.654 --> 39:28.756
–Oh, look, it's Tim!
–I want you to think of me

39:28.783 --> 39:31.659
as the engine room to your Love Boat.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.914
And our first “port of call”
is the crucial wedding dance.

39:35.998 --> 39:40.463
Now, since Will and Joanna first
said “I love you” at the Mardi Gras,

39:40.503 --> 39:44.672
I have choreographed a Brazilian
Carnival Lambada dance number.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.429
Now, this dance number is
the forbidden dance that bestows

39:48.469 --> 39:50.765
good luck and fertility
on the happy couple.

39:50.805 --> 39:55.642
And now, I'm gonna teach it to all
y'all. Do you get what I'm sayin'?

39:55.726 --> 39:58.686
All right! Let's get this party started!

40:06.779 --> 40:09.617
Oh, Marni! I'm so sorry.
We were expecting more people.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.769
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.577
–Olsen!
–Charlie! You made it!

40:14.662 --> 40:17.625
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
The flight was delayed…

40:17.665 --> 40:21.757
Don't even worry about it.
Marni, you remember Charlie, right?

40:30.302 --> 40:32.429
Uh… sorta.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.807
Come here, you!
Come here, man.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.559
–Hey!
–Hey.

40:37.685 --> 40:38.771
–Oh…
–Good to see you.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.979
–You, too.
–Hi!

40:41.063 --> 40:43.398
Marni! Ah!

40:44.191 --> 40:47.694
Wow. You look… grown-up!

40:47.778 --> 40:50.905
That's what I did. Couldn't stop it.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.241
At last!

40:53.367 --> 40:56.578
For every lovely lady,
there is a gentleman.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.497
Marcie, I want you
to dance with Charlie.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.628
And, you two, I want you to work
on that bride and groom dance.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.089
Right over there.
I'm gonna come help you.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.630
Just right that way, that's it.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.550
Remember, you're a swan. Long neck.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.976
You might wanna bend
your knees a little bit there.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.019
It's… it's the Lambada,
not the foxtrot.

41:19.059 --> 41:21.831
–Oh, OK.
–He's acting like it's a foxtrot.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.064
So, what am I doing?

41:26.233 --> 41:30.862
Uh, I'll just teach you what we learned.
It's… your left hand,

41:30.946 --> 41:35.533
foot, goes… forward,
together, back and together.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.495
Forward and together,
back and together.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.791
Don't be intimidated.
I've had two hours more practice.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.019
Oh, OK. Thank you.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.931
Mind if I drive for a while?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.310
I mean, what is she trying to prove?

41:59.350 --> 42:01.479
–Well, if I had her body…
–You'd what?

42:01.519 --> 42:05.281
I'd shut my mouth before
the next stupid thing comes out.

42:05.606 --> 42:09.484
Don't try this at home.
It's strictly for professionals.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.073
Roar!

42:18.327 --> 42:21.955
Right and left, and right and left.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.092
–Wee!
–Wait!

42:34.176 --> 42:35.552
Wee!

42:45.479 --> 42:46.521
Bang, bang!

42:58.534 --> 43:03.246
Oh, forget this. Mark, “Byer Flyer,”
on my count. Spot me.

43:03.330 --> 43:06.541
–What?
–Tim!

43:11.880 --> 43:14.007
–You ready?
–No!

43:28.397 --> 43:31.941
Two scoops of crazy
with a side of coo-coo-cachoo.

43:32.026 --> 43:35.030
I guess this means
you didn't get your apology, huh?

43:35.070 --> 43:37.842
I don't think there's
gonna be an apology.

43:37.906 --> 43:39.907
But she remembers me.

43:39.992 --> 43:43.038
Oh, yeah, and this is all
just part of her little act.

43:43.078 --> 43:46.709
Everybody loves a good story, and
that's exactly what she's giving 'em.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.003
She has got Will totally brainwashed.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.475
Come on, Marni.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

43:52.713 --> 43:54.759
He's giving her the tree house.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.133
What?

44:13.108 --> 44:16.530
Ben! I need to leave a little early
for baseball practice.

44:16.570 --> 44:21.256
I'm gonna run by Ramona's hotel!
We'll leave in about five minutes, OK?

44:21.700 --> 44:25.623
We gotta save him, Benny.
Will has protected us his entire life.

44:25.663 --> 44:29.627
–Now, it's our turn to protect him.
–What are we supposed to do, Marni?

44:29.667 --> 44:32.212
He's getting married in,
like, 48 hours.

44:32.252 --> 44:37.298
Ben. Ben. In PR, 48 hours is a lifetime.

44:37.383 --> 44:40.218
All we have to do
is isolate the problem,

44:40.302 --> 44:43.429
calculate a plan
and institute a solution.

44:45.015 --> 44:46.766
We gotta get him alone.

44:48.435 --> 44:51.815
Hey, Will. What are you doing right now?
Can I talk to you?

44:51.855 --> 44:54.443
Actually, can it wait?
Because Joanna's gonna be back soon,

44:54.483 --> 44:56.654
and I wanna sneak in a quick run here.
–No way!

44:56.694 --> 45:00.407
I was just thinking that… that I need
to sneak in a run. I'll come with you.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.951
Yeah, OK, great, Marn,
but I'm warning you,

45:02.991 --> 45:04.745
I'm training for a marathon.
Five miles OK?

45:04.785 --> 45:08.204
Uh… This is so weird.
It's like we're twins!

45:08.288 --> 45:11.919
I'm actually training for a triathlon,
which is a little bit harder,

45:11.959 --> 45:14.419
but five miles is perfect.

45:18.465 --> 45:21.342
–Charlie! Are you ready?
–Charlie?

45:26.140 --> 45:28.474
–You all right?
–Oh, yeah.

45:28.559 --> 45:32.651
No, I'm just stretching my hamstrings,
you know. Safety first.

45:35.357 --> 45:37.799
There's someone at the door.
Hold on.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.029
–Hi.
–Hi.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.575
Ramona, I'm sorry
to just sort of barge in.

45:45.659 --> 45:49.704
I just, I was kind of hoping…
Do you have a minute?

45:49.788 --> 45:53.541
–Oh, yes, absolutely. Come in.
–Wonderful. Thanks.

45:55.627 --> 45:57.381
–I'm on the phone.
–Oh, you know what?

45:57.421 --> 46:00.673
I need to use the restroom.
It was a long drive.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.593
It's, um…
up the stairs and to the left.

46:03.677 --> 46:05.928
Wow. OK.

46:07.639 --> 46:10.850
Hi. Sorry, Will's mother…

46:55.979 --> 47:00.316
No! No! No.

47:04.738 --> 47:06.113
No!

47:08.367 --> 47:09.575
No!

47:14.081 --> 47:15.540
Oh, come on.

47:30.597 --> 47:36.602
Well, your lawyer has the paperwork,
so, um… that's that.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.320
Ramona?

47:48.532 --> 47:51.200
Is everything OK?

47:51.285 --> 47:53.077
Oh, yes.

47:53.161 --> 47:58.124
You know, Ridgefield gives me
such terrible allergies.

48:01.795 --> 48:03.796
Did you take a shower?

48:05.215 --> 48:09.468
Yes. Yes, I did.

48:10.637 --> 48:15.683
I did. I did.
I hope you don't mind. I…

48:15.767 --> 48:19.979
Really I just came by because…

48:20.856 --> 48:22.481
I believe in closure.

48:22.566 --> 48:26.861
And I just wanted to come by here

48:26.987 --> 48:31.699
and tell you that
whatever happened between us

48:31.825 --> 48:36.412
is in the past,
and as far as I'm concerned…

48:37.915 --> 48:39.749
it's over.

48:39.833 --> 48:44.170
Well, I appreciate that.
Good for you, Gail. Brava.

48:44.254 --> 48:47.214
So we're good, right? We're…

48:49.009 --> 48:51.010
–Is that good?
–Yes.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.054
Good.

48:55.015 --> 48:57.475
Oh! Um…

48:57.976 --> 49:02.605
I should take that, so…
Thanks for stopping by and…

49:05.651 --> 49:09.195
–See you later.
–Alligator.

49:12.866 --> 49:14.617
Yes.

49:17.287 --> 49:21.374
Sven? Guten tag. How are you?

49:33.762 --> 49:35.974
–How you holding up, champ?
–Oh, great!

49:36.014 --> 49:38.766
I love it. I love running!

49:41.269 --> 49:45.692
Hey, Will. Earlier, at the house,
I wanted to talk to you about Joanna.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.861
Actually, I'm glad
you're bringing this up.

49:47.901 --> 49:49.571
–You are? Good.
–Yeah, sure. I mean, Marn,

49:49.611 --> 49:51.990
how can we not talk about this, right?
–Right! Because

49:52.030 --> 49:54.409
she's not just marrying you,
Will, she's marrying all of us.

49:54.449 --> 49:56.828
–We all have to put up with her.
–But I couldn't do it

49:56.868 --> 49:58.372
unless I knew I had
your support on this thing.

49:58.412 --> 50:02.331
In that case, Will, William…

50:02.416 --> 50:04.586
–Cramp!
–I know what you're about to say,

50:04.626 --> 50:08.173
and it means the world to me
that you'd actually open up your heart

50:08.213 --> 50:10.425
and bring her into
our family like that. Seriously.

50:10.465 --> 50:12.761
What's going on, kids? I thought
we were training for a marathon.

50:12.801 --> 50:15.806
–Charlie!
–Hey, you cool with this pace, Marni?

50:15.846 --> 50:16.968
–Yeah!
–You sure?

50:16.972 --> 50:18.850
–Oh, yeah. It's good.
–In that case,

50:18.890 --> 50:21.186
what do you say we sprint to the end!
–Let's do it.

50:21.226 --> 50:24.061
–Yeah? Let's go!
–Yeah? Yeah…

50:24.146 --> 50:25.980
Whoo! Come on!

50:26.606 --> 50:29.650
Whoo!

50:31.028 --> 50:33.536
Maybe I'll give you guys a head start.

50:43.540 --> 50:46.180
Come on, honey, come on.
Here, sit here.

50:46.209 --> 50:49.462
–Watch my carpet.
–Ow! Make the burning stop!

50:49.546 --> 50:52.175
I'll get Marni one of my back pills.
One of those babies,

50:52.215 --> 50:55.053
she'll be able to taste sunlight.
–Ew, gross!

50:55.093 --> 50:58.015
–Go get me my rag bag.
–Marni, what happened to you?

50:58.055 --> 51:00.892
–Uh, I took a shortcut.
–Through a woodchipper?

51:00.932 --> 51:02.892
No, through an ant bed.

51:02.976 --> 51:05.856
–I knew we shouldn't have left her.
–Oh, Charlie. You're here.

51:05.896 --> 51:09.359
I'm here, actually.
Blurred vision. That can't be good.

51:09.399 --> 51:12.443
No. Ants carried away her contacts.

51:12.527 --> 51:14.948
–What kind of ants were they?
–I forgot to ask them,

51:14.988 --> 51:18.493
but I will next time. And, really, this
is not a big deal, you guys. I'm fine.

51:18.533 --> 51:20.662
She's not. The bad news
is she hurt her leg.

51:20.702 --> 51:22.497
The good news is she can't
feel it 'cause of the ant bites.

51:22.537 --> 51:24.666
Mom, stop being so dramatic. It's not…

51:24.706 --> 51:25.748
Ah!

51:25.832 --> 51:28.170
–That did not sound good.
–Uh, you know what?

51:28.210 --> 51:30.297
That was completely my fault.
I shouldn't have been standing here.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.507
–I'm sorry. I can take care of these…
–No, no, no, no…

51:32.547 --> 51:34.173
OK,

51:34.257 --> 51:37.343
I'm actually gonna
get you to a safety zone.

51:37.427 --> 51:38.889
That looked like it hurts.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.183
You guys will not believe
what just happened. I think my…

51:41.223 --> 51:43.810
–So itchy everywhere!
–What is going on?

51:43.850 --> 51:46.146
–Marni fell into an ant bed.
–Oh, no.

51:46.186 --> 51:48.732
Well, with this many bites,
she could go into anaphylactic shock.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.443
–You're the nurse. What should we do?
–We need lard. Stat!

51:51.483 --> 51:55.986
–I need lard, stat!
–Who are you talking to?

52:11.128 --> 52:13.966
There you go. Get her, Coco!
Get her, Coco!

52:27.185 --> 52:30.521
Honey, stop with the picking.
You look fine.

52:30.605 --> 52:33.193
How lucky for me, that you kept
my glasses from tenth grade.

52:33.233 --> 52:37.278
Well, I can't get your contacts
until tomorrow morning.

52:37.362 --> 52:39.655
I thought you'd like to see.

52:42.409 --> 52:46.412
Look at them, Mom!
They look like pimples!

52:46.496 --> 52:50.627
And my bangs? It's literally like
nothing has changed since high school.

52:50.667 --> 52:54.795
Marni, I know.
But they're just ant bites,

52:54.921 --> 52:57.214
and they will go away.

52:57.299 --> 53:00.095
And, before you know it,
everything's gonna be fine,

53:00.135 --> 53:02.841
and you're gonna live
happily ever after.

53:03.305 --> 53:06.724
“Happily ever after”
is in fairy tales, Mom.

53:06.808 --> 53:10.313
High school was a horror movie.
This weekend is the sequel.

53:10.353 --> 53:13.587
It's times like this
that I like to then go back…

53:13.607 --> 53:15.402
Mom, do you always have to offer up

53:15.442 --> 53:18.780
some sweet little perfect
nugget of self-help advice?

53:18.820 --> 53:20.615
Because I'm just
really not in the mood.

53:20.655 --> 53:23.823
Well, someday you're gonna
appreciate my wisdom.

53:39.216 --> 53:44.845
Marni, being a mom is hard.
There is no rule book.

53:44.930 --> 53:47.223
Every day, you wake up and hope…

53:47.307 --> 53:51.354
You have to trust your instincts and
hope you're not messing up your kids.

53:51.394 --> 53:56.067
It's a lot of pressure. And I feel a
profound sense of responsibility that…

53:56.107 --> 54:02.071
that everything I do greatly affects
you and your brothers' lives.

54:02.447 --> 54:04.865
And that's why I want you to know

54:04.991 --> 54:08.702
that what I'm about to do is deeply,

54:08.828 --> 54:11.997
deeply… wrong!

54:13.500 --> 54:17.328
–Mom, what are you doing?
–Oh, you know I hate being late!

54:17.587 --> 54:20.839
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:20.966 --> 54:23.217
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

54:28.932 --> 54:33.185
<i>Bonjour, guten tag, hola,</i>
aloha, konichiwa! Hi, y'all.

54:33.311 --> 54:35.604
Welcome to Joanna's bridal shower.

54:40.819 --> 54:44.863
Now, listen, ladies.
Will and Joanna first met on the beach.

54:44.948 --> 54:49.964
So it seems only fitting that we begin
their wedding story in a sea of love.

54:49.995 --> 54:55.291
Viva la romance. Enjoy it, enjoy it.

54:55.375 --> 54:58.755
A little over the top. I'm gonna
just check on your grandma, OK?

54:58.795 --> 54:59.878
–OK.
–You OK?

54:59.963 --> 55:02.589
–Yep.
–All right. Hi, Mom.

55:10.557 --> 55:13.019
Oh! Marni, there you are!
I was getting worried.

55:13.059 --> 55:16.645
Girls, girls,
this is Will's sister, Marni.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.526
She actually graduated
from Ridgefield High with us.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.567
Oh, right. I remember you.

55:21.651 --> 55:24.278
We were in… homeroom together.

55:24.904 --> 55:30.617
History, fifth period, Mrs Barker.
But who's keeping track?

55:34.122 --> 55:35.914
So when are you guys due?

55:35.999 --> 55:37.416
August 23rd.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.586
Wow. Is that such a weird coincidence?

55:40.670 --> 55:43.112
Oh, no, no. We planned it in college.

55:46.468 --> 55:47.595
Oh, you're serious.

55:47.635 --> 55:49.222
And Joanna won't be far behind.

55:49.262 --> 55:51.722
–Oh…
–You know you will!

55:51.806 --> 55:53.974
Stop talking about my stomach!

55:54.059 --> 55:57.019
So, how about you, Marni?
Any little ones?

55:57.103 --> 55:58.062
Uh…

55:58.146 --> 56:01.523
Not that I know of.

56:04.569 --> 56:05.932
And now I'd like to give
a special thanks to my bridesmaids.

56:05.972 --> 56:09.350
Here's just a small token
of my appreciation.

56:15.434 --> 56:19.688
–That is so sweet.
–Oh, so sweet.

56:19.772 --> 56:21.815
I will cherish this forever.

56:26.028 --> 56:28.238
I hope you like it.

56:31.701 --> 56:35.829
I told your mother Olivia
was a terrible middle name.

56:38.499 --> 56:40.628
Grandma, does it ever get any easier?

56:40.668 --> 56:43.336
–What, dear?
–This!

56:43.421 --> 56:45.302
–Life, everything.
–Marni, don't let the way

56:45.342 --> 56:50.477
Marni, don't let the way
those girls treated you bring you down.

56:50.754 --> 56:52.963
We are our experiences.

56:53.048 --> 56:56.303
That terrible time made you
the woman you are today.

56:56.343 --> 56:59.428
You're right.

56:59.512 --> 57:02.097
You're absolutely right, Grandma.

57:03.266 --> 57:04.520
I'll be right back.

57:07.729 --> 57:11.982
<i>–Amuse-bouche?</i>
–Not since college.

57:15.695 --> 57:18.364
Hey, sis. Isn't this a blast?

57:18.448 --> 57:22.576
Look, sis,
I've had enough of this game.

57:22.661 --> 57:24.831
You can make this
real easy on yourself.

57:24.871 --> 57:26.541
All you have to do is apologize.

57:26.581 --> 57:29.669
If you apologize, I'll keep
my mouth shut about everything.

57:29.709 --> 57:31.752
Fine. Sorry.

57:32.837 --> 57:36.257
That's it? That…
That's your big apology?

57:36.341 --> 57:39.927
All right.
Well, you've made your trundle.

57:40.011 --> 57:43.839
Maybe Will should lie in it
and hear a few of the details.

57:45.684 --> 57:49.561
I'd think very carefully
before I did anything crazy, sis.

57:49.646 --> 57:52.692
Who do you honestly think
your brother will believe?

57:52.732 --> 57:56.151
No. Hm-hm.
You're not doing this to me again.

57:56.236 --> 57:58.573
I am not the same four-eyed,
acne-covered girl

57:58.613 --> 57:59.950
you pushed around in high school.

57:59.990 --> 58:04.618
Really? Have you taken
a look in the mirror lately?

58:30.061 --> 58:32.857
I gotta admit, the first
few rounds went to Joanna.

58:32.897 --> 58:35.735
She played some very good hands.
Very good. But I'm glad.

58:35.775 --> 58:39.698
It made me realize that we have to step
it up, take it to a whole new level.

58:39.738 --> 58:44.450
Whoa. “We?”
No, she's your arch nemesis.

58:44.534 --> 58:47.703
I'm not gonna be a part
of your evil plan.

58:47.787 --> 58:49.833
–I'll give you 20 bucks.
–Done.

58:51.583 --> 58:54.001
Will may not believe his own sister,

58:54.085 --> 58:58.177
but I think he'll have a hard time
not believing his own eyes.

58:59.299 --> 59:00.591
Start digging.

59:03.678 --> 59:06.391
Hey, where is Mom?
It's getting kind of late.

59:06.431 --> 59:08.601
She said she got tied up in town.
I'm sure she's on her way.

59:08.641 --> 59:11.104
Well, with the way she drives,
she'll be here in a second.

59:11.144 --> 59:12.772
–She drives like a maniac.
–I know.

59:12.812 --> 59:14.733
We're co-hosting this party.
She's got to be here any minute.

59:14.773 --> 59:15.814
She will.

59:21.988 --> 59:24.698
Honey, you look amazing!

59:27.619 --> 59:28.741
Stay right there.

59:29.412 --> 59:32.498
Wow! Mom, you look great.

59:39.464 --> 59:41.215
Thank you.

59:42.342 --> 59:43.842
Hey!

59:46.971 --> 59:48.722
Thank you.

59:54.270 --> 59:59.650
Sadly, my dress was ruined, and I had to
find a replacement on very short notice.

59:59.734 --> 01:00:04.363
Quick, somebody call Us Weekly.
Let's find out “Who Wore It Best?”

01:00:05.698 --> 01:00:08.242
Joanna!

01:00:08.326 --> 01:00:12.329
–You look divine!
–Aw, thank you.

01:00:15.583 --> 01:00:16.583
Hi, guys.

01:00:17.919 --> 01:00:21.380
I'm sorry. What is he doing here?

01:00:21.506 --> 01:00:23.090
Who?

01:00:24.676 --> 01:00:26.593
–Sausages.
–Oh!

01:00:26.678 --> 01:00:30.472
Look, I hope you guys
don't mind that I invited Tim.

01:00:30.557 --> 01:00:33.851
Yeah, well, I sorta do.

01:00:33.935 --> 01:00:36.564
It's just, it's so awkward
to come to these things alone,

01:00:36.604 --> 01:00:39.526
and you said that you and Tim
were never serious,

01:00:39.566 --> 01:00:42.470
so I figured that
it wouldn't be a big deal.

01:00:43.528 --> 01:00:46.155
I thought…
You know what? You're right.

01:00:46.239 --> 01:00:47.951
I should have asked. I'm sorry.

01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:51.704
Um… I'll go ask Tim to leave.
And that… That will be fine.

01:00:51.744 --> 01:00:54.332
You know what? I don't really care.
It's… I'm used to…

01:00:54.372 --> 01:00:56.000
being the solo girl, so it's…

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.294
Marni, you don't have to ask him
to leave. I mean, Tim can stay.

01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:01.086
–It's not that big of a deal.
–Really?

01:01:05.717 --> 01:01:09.136
You know, I… I will be right back.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.555
–Thank you.
–No biggie.

01:01:22.734 --> 01:01:24.735
–Hi.
–Hey.

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:29.033
–Let's move that.
–I think that's mine.

01:01:29.073 --> 01:01:32.409
–Shh-shh… Danger…
–It goes to the right.

01:01:32.494 --> 01:01:36.038
–Danger… Ooh, sharp.
–Danger…

01:01:36.122 --> 01:01:37.959
–Yes. What are you doing?
–Yes.

01:01:37.999 --> 01:01:40.128
I'm just… I'm creating
a safe zone for you.

01:01:40.168 --> 01:01:42.711
Oh, for me? I won't! I'm not gonna…

01:01:42.795 --> 01:01:44.883
–I'm… I'm totally safe, I promise.
–You won't what?

01:01:44.923 --> 01:01:48.759
Safe? Ah. My lip,
my head and my big toe

01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:53.892
would beg to differ with that statement.
There is nothing safe about you, Olsen.

01:01:53.932 --> 01:01:55.518
–I got you three times?
–Three times.

01:01:55.558 --> 01:01:57.937
–I'm so embarrassed.
–One time was my big toe,

01:01:57.977 --> 01:02:00.273
my favorite feature on my body.
–Oh, no.

01:02:00.313 --> 01:02:02.609
–You have so much flesh on it.
–It still hurts, to be honest. I know.

01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:04.274
It is the big one.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.692
Uh-oh.

01:02:06.277 --> 01:02:10.030
I believe this seat is reserved for Tim.
Are you a Tim?

01:02:10.114 --> 01:02:12.241
–No.
–Yeah, it's a wedding.

01:02:12.325 --> 01:02:14.078
You have to sit in the seats
that they reserve for you.

01:02:14.118 --> 01:02:15.914
It's not like a
normal restaurant or anything.

01:02:15.954 --> 01:02:18.956
–That's my seat, so…
–Yeah. Sorry.

01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:20.290
Um…

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.462
–Yeah.
–I have a drink, so you should…

01:02:22.502 --> 01:02:25.423
–I'm gonna head over to this table.
–OK, I'll…

01:02:25.463 --> 01:02:28.593
–I'm a “Charlie,” by the way.
–I don't know where the Charlies are.

01:02:28.633 --> 01:02:29.761
It's not my responsibility.

01:02:29.801 --> 01:02:31.221
I'll be with the Charlies,
if you need me.

01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:35.055
I'll come to over to… after.

01:02:41.145 --> 01:02:43.480
Wow. Uh, thanks, Tim.

01:02:44.482 --> 01:02:46.108
What is it?

01:02:46.192 --> 01:02:50.028
–It's an umbrella drink.
–I see that.

01:02:50.154 --> 01:02:52.656
Joanna and I went to Cancun once.

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:03.250
What are you doing
over here all by yourself?

01:03:03.334 --> 01:03:08.964
Oh, nothing.
Just missing Mom and Dad.

01:03:09.048 --> 01:03:10.969
I still can't believe
they aren't here for this.

01:03:11.009 --> 01:03:14.722
I mean, I always thought Daddy
would walk me down the aisle.

01:03:14.762 --> 01:03:19.933
I know, sweetheart. I miss them, too.

01:03:28.526 --> 01:03:31.862
Anything else bothering you?

01:03:32.989 --> 01:03:35.949
–Aunt Mona…
–Yeah?

01:03:36.034 --> 01:03:38.955
Have you ever done something
you wish you could take back?

01:03:38.995 --> 01:03:41.121
My last two marriages.

01:03:41.205 --> 01:03:44.416
And I'm starting
to rethink these heels.

01:03:46.419 --> 01:03:47.753
Why?

01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:51.590
I made a mistake.

01:03:51.674 --> 01:03:55.427
Big, big mistake, and I…

01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:57.515
I don't… I don't
know what to do about it.

01:03:57.555 --> 01:04:01.725
You're human, Joanna.
Making mistakes is part of what we do.

01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:04.845
It's how we go about
fixing them that matters.

01:04:06.356 --> 01:04:12.277
I know that whatever you do,
it will be the right thing. OK?

01:04:13.738 --> 01:04:18.408
I'm so proud of you.
And I know your parents are, too.

01:04:18.493 --> 01:04:20.952
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

01:04:22.121 --> 01:04:28.043
<i>Bonsoir, guten abend,
buenas noches, shalom, konbanwa…</i>

01:04:28.127 --> 01:04:30.504
good evening. I'm Georgia King!

01:04:36.427 --> 01:04:39.262
Will, I have a big
surprise for the groom.

01:04:39.347 --> 01:04:41.976
Tomorrow, you and Joanna
are going to give yourselves

01:04:42.016 --> 01:04:44.187
to one another through wedding vows.

01:04:44.227 --> 01:04:47.854
But tonight, Joanna is going
to pledge herself to you…

01:04:51.609 --> 01:04:55.028
Honey, what are they doing?

01:04:55.113 --> 01:04:56.613
I'm frightened.

01:05:00.326 --> 01:05:02.953
Hi.

01:05:04.664 --> 01:05:08.458
This is for you, Will.
I love you so much, baby.

01:05:08.543 --> 01:05:10.585
<i>Aw…</i>

01:05:18.428 --> 01:05:20.408
You have got to be kidding me.

01:05:32.984 --> 01:05:35.861
Finally, something she can't do.

01:05:35.945 --> 01:05:37.654
Forget this!

01:05:41.451 --> 01:05:43.160
–Wow!
–What's this?

01:06:13.941 --> 01:06:15.358
Whoo!

01:06:18.237 --> 01:06:21.200
<i>♫ My girls are wicked, wicked
We're slammin' and we're jammin'</i>

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.245

01:06:24.285 --> 01:06:27.415

01:06:27.455 --> 01:06:29.167

01:06:29.207 --> 01:06:30.793

<i>♫ Homies want a man

01:06:43.513 --> 01:06:46.058
I cannot believe my brother
is falling for this.

<i>♫ He's a miggida-miggida-miggida

01:06:48.351 --> 01:06:52.190
Oh, honey, this is not my first

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:55.026
I know true love when I see it,
and this, my dear sweet bridesmaid,

01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:58.404
is true love. Now, come on!
This is a party! Have fun!

01:06:58.444 --> 01:07:01.655
<i>♫ Jump, uh-huh, uh-huh
Jump, jump.</i>

01:07:01.739 --> 01:07:04.449
Bravo!

01:07:04.534 --> 01:07:07.536
I love you! I love you so much!

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.287
Joanna.

01:07:15.378 --> 01:07:18.755
OK, OK, OK. I knew we were
getting a new daughter,

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.925
I had no idea we were
getting a rap star!

01:07:24.095 --> 01:07:28.306
–Bravo!
–Will, I love you.

01:07:28.391 --> 01:07:31.685
Your mother and I
could not be more proud of you.

01:07:31.769 --> 01:07:36.692
Not only are you one heck of a lawyer,
you are compassionate, you are caring,

01:07:36.732 --> 01:07:39.693
and, most importantly, you're honest.

01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:44.781
To see that you have found someone
with all those same qualities

01:07:44.866 --> 01:07:48.785
makes me the happiest man
in this room.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:52.706
Joanna, while technically
I'm the best man,

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:56.293
you should know that tomorrow
the real best man

01:07:56.419 --> 01:07:59.087
will be standing right next to you.

01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:00.964
–Oh!
–Oh…

01:08:01.632 --> 01:08:05.677
–To Will and Joanna.
–To Will and Joanna.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.684
–Will?
–Yeah?

01:08:12.768 --> 01:08:14.480
I have something I need
to tell you. I haven't…

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.023
–Sure.
–I haven't been totally honest…

01:08:16.063 --> 01:08:17.859
Is there anyone else
who would like to make a toast?

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:20.442
–Tim does!
–Oh, no.

01:08:23.321 --> 01:08:24.904
OK.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.416
Joanna, congratulations
on a very special evening.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.002
I just wanted to say tonight
is an amazing occasion,

01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:42.421
and it's special for many reasons.

01:08:42.506 --> 01:08:44.510
One of them being that
Joanna and I finally

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:47.344
get to share a rehearsal dinner
together.

01:08:47.428 --> 01:08:51.225
Of course, I would rather it
had been our rehearsal dinner,

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:54.059
but beggars can't be choosers.
Um…

01:08:54.143 --> 01:08:59.022
But in all seriousness, uh…
Joanna,

01:08:59.148 --> 01:09:03.984
after many, many, many,
many hours of therapy…

01:09:05.237 --> 01:09:07.325
I know now why you
didn't show up that night.

01:09:07.365 --> 01:09:10.286
–The two of you were engaged?
–And I even know that it's my fault.

01:09:10.326 --> 01:09:12.705
It was right after college.
I was young and immature.

01:09:12.745 --> 01:09:14.662
That's OK.

01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:20.085
I missed you, Joanna.

01:09:21.212 --> 01:09:23.505
I miss your voice, I miss the…

01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:27.384
Oh, God, she used to make
this sound when we would…

01:09:27.468 --> 01:09:29.219
when we would snuggle.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:34.307
Remind me to change my phone number.

01:09:34.392 --> 01:09:36.725
I got cold feet. He wigged out!

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:38.856
–How could you not tell me this?
–I'm sorry.

01:09:38.895 --> 01:09:41.206
I'd like to dedicate a song to you.

01:09:42.233 --> 01:09:43.566
This was our song.

01:09:46.237 --> 01:09:50.698
<i>♫ Overnight scenes
Dinner and wine</i>

01:09:50.783 --> 01:09:52.867
<i>♫ Saturday girls</i>

01:09:52.952 --> 01:09:57.205
<i>♫ I was never in love
Never had the time</i>

01:09:57.289 --> 01:10:00.500
<i>♫ In my hustle and hurry world</i>

01:10:00.584 --> 01:10:03.586
<i>♫ Laughing myself to sleep</i>

01:10:03.671 --> 01:10:06.131
<i>♫ Waking up lonely</i>

01:10:06.924 --> 01:10:11.845
<i>♫ I needed someone to hold me,
Joanna</i>

01:10:11.929 --> 01:10:17.934
<i>♫ Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me</i>

01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:25.817
<i>♫ You're my fantasy
You're my reality</i>

01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:31.698
<i>♫ Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me</i>

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:34.562
<i>♫ You're everything I see</i>

01:10:35.244 --> 01:10:39.122
<i>♫ You're everything to me
Oh, yeah.</i>

01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:51.593
Thanks, Tim…

01:10:56.307 --> 01:10:57.807
for that.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:04.147
And now we have a special video
for Joanna from the bridal party.

01:11:04.231 --> 01:11:07.484
A video? Did you know about this?

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.737
Engaged, Joanna? To that guy?

01:11:24.877 --> 01:11:26.961
<i>OK, I'm ready.</i>

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:32.425
<i>Hi, I'm JJ Clark and
I'm a senior at Ridgefield High.</i>

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:36.265
<i>We're supposed to tell all you losers
what life is like in 2002</i>

01:11:36.305 --> 01:11:38.684
<i>so you can see how much
things have changed.</i>

01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:39.977
How did they find this?

01:11:40.017 --> 01:11:43.105
<i>Wanna know what life's like
for an 18-year-old in high school?</i>

01:11:43.145 --> 01:11:45.688
<i>Life is easy.</i>

01:11:45.773 --> 01:11:47.610
This was for the time capsule.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:50.154
They said no one would
see it for 50 years.

01:11:50.194 --> 01:11:53.157
<i>I mean, sure you gotta
work at it to be number one.</i>

01:11:53.197 --> 01:11:57.553
<i>But high school's not brain surgery.
It's more like prison.</i>

01:11:59.411 --> 01:12:02.124
<i>And, in this prison, I'm the warden.</i>

01:12:02.164 --> 01:12:05.728
<i>So it's my job to keep
all the inmates in line.</i>

01:12:06.377 --> 01:12:09.212
<i>Oh, look, here's one now.</i>

01:12:10.548 --> 01:12:12.802
<i>In high school, only the strong survive.</i>

01:12:12.842 --> 01:12:15.802
<i>The meek shall not inherit the earth.</i>

01:12:18.139 --> 01:12:20.557
<i>Moo!</i>

01:12:24.436 --> 01:12:26.690
<i>High school's a four-year sentence.</i>

01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:29.819
<i>They don't let you out early
for good behavior.</i>

01:12:29.859 --> 01:12:33.194
<i>So, take it from me,
it's better to be bad.</i>

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.489
<i>Out of my way!</i>

01:12:49.295 --> 01:12:53.798
Will. I'm so sorry.

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:58.845
I was a stupid kid, and you know
that's not who I am anymore.

01:12:58.929 --> 01:13:01.264
No…

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:04.562
See, I don't think I know
who anyone is anymore, Joanna.

01:13:04.602 --> 01:13:07.270
So I'm just gonna get some air here.

01:13:10.774 --> 01:13:14.777
Wait! Wait, don't…
Where are you going?

01:13:15.613 --> 01:13:16.946
Will?

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:30.210
Still no answer?

01:13:31.378 --> 01:13:34.008
What a mess. Maybe we should
head home, see if Will's there.

01:13:34.048 --> 01:13:35.342
–OK.
–Come on, Bunny.

01:13:35.382 --> 01:13:36.900
Ben, let's get the car.

01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:39.135
Let's go.

01:13:40.846 --> 01:13:43.681
Oh, wait…
Miss, don't forget your video.

01:13:45.184 --> 01:13:47.477
–Your video? What…
–I'm sorry.

01:13:47.561 --> 01:13:52.357
I just wanted Will to know the truth.
I was trying to protect him.

01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:58.145
Mom, I know you said to put it
behind me, but I guess I just couldn't.

01:14:00.157 --> 01:14:03.523
–I'll get the car.
–I'll go see if I can find Will.

01:14:05.955 --> 01:14:07.935
Oh, Marni, what have you done?

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.650
We'll talk about this at home.

01:14:16.674 --> 01:14:18.341
OK.

01:14:47.037 --> 01:14:49.080
Just go away! OK?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.087
Look, I didn't intend for that to be…

01:14:53.127 --> 01:14:57.672
You have got a lot of nerve.
You know that?

01:14:57.756 --> 01:15:00.383
I'm sorry, I've got a lot of nerve?

01:15:00.509 --> 01:15:03.013
Because you're the one
who came in here

01:15:03.053 --> 01:15:05.266
pretending like
nothing had ever happened.

01:15:05.306 --> 01:15:07.601
Pretending like we didn't
even know each other.

01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:11.394
And Tim? How did
you know about that?

01:15:11.478 --> 01:15:14.358
I didn't know Tim was a freak.
None of us did.

01:15:14.398 --> 01:15:17.066
Please. That's why you invited him.

01:15:19.737 --> 01:15:22.113
But that video?

01:15:23.073 --> 01:15:24.949
Now, that was genius.

01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:31.581
You know… I really
underestimated you.

01:15:31.665 --> 01:15:36.169
I thought we could start over, but no.

01:15:36.253 --> 01:15:39.088
You were so completely
stuck in the past

01:15:39.214 --> 01:15:41.051
that you just couldn't let it go,
could you?

01:15:41.091 --> 01:15:45.136
Hey, I wanted a real apology,
and I deserved one.

01:15:45.262 --> 01:15:48.350
–It was high school.
–You don't get to belittle this.

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:52.187
Do you have any idea what all
those years of torment did to me?

01:15:52.227 --> 01:15:53.689
Every day after school,

01:15:53.729 --> 01:15:57.425
I came home feeling horrible
about myself thanks to you.

01:15:57.483 --> 01:16:00.487
You can't just ruin someone's life
and pretend like it didn't happen.

01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:04.322
You just ruined my life!
Do you get that?

01:16:05.074 --> 01:16:07.786
The fact that you're
standing here right now,

01:16:07.826 --> 01:16:12.955
asking me to feel sorry for you,
is priceless.

01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:18.005
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you walking away from me?

01:16:18.045 --> 01:16:19.295
Uh-huh.

01:16:20.798 --> 01:16:24.425
Nice work. Like mother, like daughter?

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:27.136
–Excuse me?
–Your daughter just ruined

01:16:27.262 --> 01:16:29.808
what should have been
the happiest night of Joanna's life.

01:16:29.848 --> 01:16:32.019
Just broke her heart, just like that.

01:16:32.059 --> 01:16:33.518
Sound familiar?

01:16:34.853 --> 01:16:36.562
Did you see the video?

01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:40.274
I did. Nice timing, too,
at the rehearsal dinner.

01:16:40.359 --> 01:16:42.568
Did you?

01:16:44.571 --> 01:16:49.367
–I'm not doing this in here.
–Fine with me. Let's go.

01:16:55.416 --> 01:17:00.253
Marni!

01:17:09.263 --> 01:17:12.682
–Are you insane?
–What do you think?

01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:16.198
I think my brother was smart
to get out when he did.

01:17:21.525 --> 01:17:24.485
Oh, kitty likes to scratch.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:26.863
Well, two can play at this game.

01:17:37.082 --> 01:17:38.416
Warm-up.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.668
–Just gettin' loose.
–Yeah?

01:17:48.177 --> 01:17:52.805
Ooh! Presents!
Oh, don't you just love this?

01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:54.098
<i>Aw…</i>

01:17:54.516 --> 01:17:58.728
Marni, let's just… not do that.

01:17:59.229 --> 01:18:01.772
No, no, no! Marni, please don't!

01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:05.157
That was a wedding gift.
It cost a fortune! Don't…

01:18:05.194 --> 01:18:08.070
Don't do it. Just… Marni?

01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:10.267
One less thank-you note to send.

01:18:17.873 --> 01:18:20.541
You are so gonna regret that.

01:18:23.212 --> 01:18:26.091
I always wished I was
strong enough to stand up to you.

01:18:26.131 --> 01:18:28.719
But you know what I
finally realized today?

01:18:28.759 --> 01:18:31.052
I don't need to stand up to you.

01:18:31.136 --> 01:18:34.639
It's not worth it.
You're a liar, and you're a phony.

01:18:34.723 --> 01:18:36.685
My family's better off without you.

01:18:36.725 --> 01:18:39.018
Will is better off without you.

01:18:39.937 --> 01:18:43.523
I'm done with you. My feet hurt.

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.458
–Yeah!
–Stop it!

01:19:02.543 --> 01:19:04.710
What are you doing, Joanna?

01:19:04.795 --> 01:19:08.258
I came back in here to see if you
were OK. I was concerned about you.

01:19:08.298 --> 01:19:10.469
I was worried about you,
but from the looks of it,

01:19:10.509 --> 01:19:13.514
I would say that you are more than
capable of taking care of yourself.

01:19:13.554 --> 01:19:15.933
I just can't believe
that I fell for that.

01:19:15.973 --> 01:19:18.060
That whole Meals on Wheels,
Mother Teresa act.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.939
You are so good, and I'm so stupid
because I fully believed you!

01:19:21.979 --> 01:19:23.899
I thought I knew exactly
who you were. Do you know that?

01:19:23.939 --> 01:19:28.757
–You do know who I am, Will! You do!
–Yes, Joanna, I do know who you are.

01:19:29.444 --> 01:19:31.782
You're a bully.
You're a liar. You are…

01:19:31.822 --> 01:19:33.742
–An emotional terrorist!
–You stay out of this, Marni!

01:19:33.782 --> 01:19:35.244
Do you know that you are
just as much to blame?

01:19:35.284 --> 01:19:38.497
–No, Will, I needed to…
–No… No! Stop talking to me!

01:19:38.537 --> 01:19:42.748
Going behind my back,
helping to orchestrate this thing,

01:19:42.833 --> 01:19:45.295
how could you do that to me?
How could you do that to me?

01:19:45.335 --> 01:19:47.130
What is wrong with both of you?

01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:52.592
I'm sorry, Will. I'm sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

01:19:52.676 --> 01:19:55.847
I wanted to tell you the truth
about who I was back then. I swear.

01:19:55.887 --> 01:19:58.642
You don't get it, do you?
No, you don't get it.

01:19:58.682 --> 01:20:01.979
You still don't get it. No, because I
don't care who you were in high school.

01:20:02.019 --> 01:20:05.607
I don't care that you were engaged.
I don't care about anything!

01:20:05.647 --> 01:20:09.734
I care that you lied to me about it!
You lied to me!

01:20:11.278 --> 01:20:15.436
You lied to me. And who was
I supposed to be marrying tomorrow?

01:20:15.449 --> 01:20:18.829
Now, who is that? Is that the girl
that I sang karaoke with on the beach?

01:20:18.869 --> 01:20:20.956
'Cause I liked that girl.
I liked that girl so much.

01:20:20.996 --> 01:20:24.123
Or the warden of Ridgefield High School?

01:20:28.211 --> 01:20:33.716
Wait! Will, please don't!
Please! Wait!

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.601
You have been playing me since
the moment you walked in my house.

01:20:40.641 --> 01:20:43.228
–Playing you?
–Why? What happened between us?

01:20:43.268 --> 01:20:45.647
–Tell me.
–You honestly don't remember?

01:20:45.687 --> 01:20:47.139
I remember everything!

01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:49.860
You don't remember
that we were best friends,

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.362
and then all through high school,
every single time,

01:20:52.402 --> 01:20:55.032
–I was runner-up to you?
–Runner-up to me?

01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:57.743
–Ramona, it wasn't a competition.
–Of course it wasn't.

01:20:57.783 --> 01:21:02.161
–You always won.
–I won because they voted for me!

01:21:02.245 --> 01:21:05.459
Do you remember cheerleading?
You made me try out.

01:21:05.499 --> 01:21:08.211
You got on the squad.
I got laughed out the door.

01:21:08.251 --> 01:21:10.336
Oh, come on. You were great!

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.507
Oh, please. And let's
not forget about Grease.

01:21:12.547 --> 01:21:15.216
You knew how badly
I wanted to be Sandy.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.055
But no, of course
you just had to audition.

01:21:18.095 --> 01:21:20.807
I always wanted to be
in a musical, Ramona. Always.

01:21:20.847 --> 01:21:24.686
Oh, please. You don't even sing.
You were already prom queen.

01:21:24.726 --> 01:21:27.898
You were already head cheerleader.
Drama was supposed to be mine.

01:21:27.938 --> 01:21:29.733
But no, you didn't think about me.

01:21:29.773 --> 01:21:32.444
All you cared about,
when you got to high school, was you.

01:21:32.484 --> 01:21:36.239
Oh, what was I supposed to do, Ramona?
Slow down so you could catch up?

01:21:36.279 --> 01:21:38.572
–That's mean.
–Don't push me.

01:21:38.657 --> 01:21:40.282
Don't you…

01:21:45.247 --> 01:21:47.373
Are you insane?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.212
After all that, you stole
Richie Phillips from me!

01:21:53.296 --> 01:21:55.965
Richie Phillips? From high school?

01:21:56.049 --> 01:21:59.802
–I was in love with him!
–You were in love with him?

01:21:59.886 --> 01:22:01.515
And you went to the prom with him.

01:22:01.555 --> 01:22:04.598
–He asked me, Ramona!
–You were my friend.

01:22:04.683 --> 01:22:06.767
You were supposed to say no!

01:22:06.852 --> 01:22:09.106
That's when I knew
I could never count on you.

01:22:09.146 --> 01:22:13.318
I promised myself I would never let
anyone make me feel the way you did.

01:22:13.358 --> 01:22:14.945
You know what? I should thank you.

01:22:14.985 --> 01:22:18.081
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have worked so hard,

01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:20.150
and I wouldn't have
achieved what I have-.

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.726
Well, good for you.

01:22:21.825 --> 01:22:25.363
Oh, come off it. It just
makes you crazy that I've…

01:22:25.462 --> 01:22:28.024
that I've done all this
and that I look so good.

01:22:28.064 --> 01:22:30.861
You know what, Ramona?
Honestly, I'm proud of you.

01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:33.463
I am proud of what
you've accomplished in your life.

01:22:33.503 --> 01:22:38.316
I think you've done amazingly.
But my family is my accomplishment.

01:22:38.375 --> 01:22:40.971
So I'm not jealous of you.
I have a family.

01:22:41.011 --> 01:22:43.651
They love me. I'm happy!

01:22:43.713 --> 01:22:47.251
Well, happiness isn't everything.

01:22:48.485 --> 01:22:52.262
OK, I'm outta here.

01:22:53.423 --> 01:22:56.165
I was jealous. You had it all.

01:22:56.226 --> 01:23:01.198
You were pretty, you were smart,
everyone wanted to be your friend.

01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:05.962
Just seeing you the other night
with all your family just…

01:23:06.002 --> 01:23:10.951
reminded me of…
My marriages haven't worked out,

01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:14.250
and Joanna's all I have.

01:23:14.344 --> 01:23:16.654
Now, you want to take her away too.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.576
And I knew that would happen
as soon as I found out

01:23:19.616 --> 01:23:21.662
that she was marrying your son.

01:23:25.055 --> 01:23:28.264
I'm sorry, Ramona. Honestly.

01:23:29.392 --> 01:23:32.692
And I should have been
a better friend, obviously.

01:23:32.729 --> 01:23:34.970
I knew what I was doing.

01:23:35.065 --> 01:23:38.569
I was so busy

01:23:38.635 --> 01:23:42.549
being Gail Byer
and everything that that meant.

01:23:42.639 --> 01:23:44.778
I just… I was insensitive.

01:23:44.874 --> 01:23:47.878
I wasn't a good friend. And I'm sorry.

01:23:55.051 --> 01:23:59.261
I can't believe I got
a makeover because of you.

01:23:59.322 --> 01:24:01.996
–You did?
–Of course I did!

01:24:02.092 --> 01:24:05.596
I almost got hair extensions.

01:24:05.662 --> 01:24:08.291
Your hair flips around,
and I was jealous.

01:24:08.331 --> 01:24:10.174
Oh, I'm so glad.

01:24:13.637 --> 01:24:15.776
I feel like I can breathe again.

01:24:15.839 --> 01:24:19.912
Really? I can't breathe!
I'm underwater!

01:24:22.846 --> 01:24:25.019
What is going on out here?

01:24:30.754 --> 01:24:34.318
I'm very disappointed
with the behavior I saw tonight.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.087
I don't pretend
to have the slightest clue

01:24:37.127 --> 01:24:40.108
about how things work in the girl world.

01:24:41.498 --> 01:24:44.160
To be perfectly honest,
it frightens and confuses me.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.806
But here's what I do know.

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.633
A wedding is a time
for a family to come together.

01:24:49.673 --> 01:24:54.095
But, for whatever reason, this wedding
is tearing our family apart.

01:24:54.544 --> 01:24:56.217
Will is missing.

01:24:56.313 --> 01:24:58.942
Ramona's out searching
the streets for Joanna.

01:24:58.982 --> 01:25:02.178
This weekend is a disaster.
And I, for one, have had it.

01:25:02.218 --> 01:25:04.858
You two are completely out of Control.

01:25:04.954 --> 01:25:08.163
But nothing!

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:16.374
You're grounded. Go to your rooms.

01:25:25.075 --> 01:25:26.645
What is it, Coco Puff?

01:25:28.478 --> 01:25:31.322
What is it?

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:02.183
Oh, no.

01:26:03.513 --> 01:26:04.924
No

01:26:06.916 --> 01:26:11.058
Joanna don't do it, Don't…

01:26:12.222 --> 01:26:14.725
Joanna, put down the spray cheese.

01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:19.366
It's not worth it.
There are so many carbs.

01:26:19.429 --> 01:26:23.206
Oh, what difference does it make?

01:26:23.266 --> 01:26:26.440
It's not like
I'm getting married anymore.

01:26:29.205 --> 01:26:33.278
I am an awful person.

01:26:34.577 --> 01:26:36.420
Hey, remember me?

01:26:36.479 --> 01:26:38.942
I'm the one who ruined
your rehearsal dinner.

01:26:38.982 --> 01:26:43.761
–Think I'm the awful person.
–Oh, Marni, stop. Just…

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.096
.Just stop apologizing.

01:26:46.956 --> 01:26:49.903
Ugh I deserved it.

01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:54.931
I deserve all of it!

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.742
Hey! OK, wait. Joanna.

01:26:59.836 --> 01:27:02.908
Hand that over Give her here.

01:27:03.006 --> 01:27:05.987
Why don't We share?
Hey that's nice

01:27:06.075 --> 01:27:08.578
Let's see. Looks… Ooh, it looks good.

01:27:08.645 --> 01:27:12.491
That's right, we can share that.
Looks good

01:27:22.158 --> 01:27:25.469
I just spent so many years,

01:27:25.528 --> 01:27:29.874
so many years trying to
distance myself from the person I was.

01:27:32.535 --> 01:27:38.178
I just wanted to be a person
my parents were proud of, you know?

01:27:38.274 --> 01:27:39.878
Hey.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.622
I'm sure your parents
would be very proud of you

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.348
Ye-ah, they would've
been proud of me

01:27:52.388 --> 01:27:57.140
if I would've apologized to you the
moment you walked through that door.

01:27:59.229 --> 01:28:01.958
I just didn't want Will
or your parents to know

01:28:01.998 --> 01:28:05.002
how awful I was back them.

01:28:06.236 --> 01:28:09.046
I love them all so much.

01:28:11.674 --> 01:28:16.419
And it's been such a long time
since I've had a real family.

01:28:16.513 --> 01:28:19.357
I just didn't wanna lose them.

01:28:19.415 --> 01:28:21.986
I panicked.

01:28:22.051 --> 01:28:25.260
You panicked? I freaked out.

01:28:25.355 --> 01:28:28.893
I went all… Marni dearest on you guys.

01:28:32.562 --> 01:28:35.907
You're never gonna lose them.
They adore you.

01:28:37.834 --> 01:28:40.474
You fit into my family better than I do.

01:28:40.537 --> 01:28:42.881
Oh that's not true.

01:28:43.873 --> 01:28:47.218
But I think the reason why they love me

01:28:47.277 --> 01:28:51.248
is because they really miss you.

01:28:54.851 --> 01:28:56.922
Look. Marni,

01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:01.230
I don't expect you to ever forgive me,

01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:07.207
but I do want you to know
that I am truly sorry.

01:29:13.236 --> 01:29:15.999
Would you mind Saying
that just one more time,

01:29:16.039 --> 01:29:22.046
just, like, slower or something?
–I'm sorry, Marni, for being so evil.

01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:26.457
For… For pushing you
onto that basketball court.

01:29:26.549 --> 01:29:29.996
For… Oh, gosh, for everything.

01:29:31.154 --> 01:29:35.398
I really, I… I really apologize.

01:29:38.328 --> 01:29:40.569
Thank you, Joanna.

01:29:42.398 --> 01:29:45.436
Oh, gosh.

01:29:45.501 --> 01:29:47.697
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:29:47.737 --> 01:29:51.344
I really don't. Will won't talk to me.

01:29:51.441 --> 01:29:55.150
I have made such a mess of things.

01:29:55.244 --> 01:29:59.750
I've really…
I can't live without him, Marni.

01:30:00.984 --> 01:30:03.521
I think…

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:09.161
everything is gonna
turn out just fine. Trust me.

01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:13.702
You got this.

01:30:20.103 --> 01:30:21.776
–WM?
–Go away.

01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:23.316
–No, Will!
–Go away!

01:30:23.373 --> 01:30:26.946
Wait! Would you just
wait for a second? Will!

01:30:27.010 --> 01:30:28.614
Oh, ow!

01:30:28.678 --> 01:30:30.340
–My leg!
–Are you OK? Which leg is it?

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.608
It's the same leg from the other day!

01:30:31.648 --> 01:30:33.776
It's my bad leg!
–Marni, guess what?

01:30:33.816 --> 01:30:35.511
You hurt your left leg the other day,

01:30:35.551 --> 01:30:37.246
but really, good try, Marni.
–Wait, Will, hear me out.

01:30:37.286 --> 01:30:38.848
Marni, I don't wanna hear you out!

01:30:38.888 --> 01:30:40.450
I don't wanna hear anything
you have to say, OK?

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:43.019
You ruined what should have been
the best day of my life.

01:30:43.059 --> 01:30:46.887
–Do you understand that?
–Yes, I do. And I'm really sorry.

01:30:47.063 --> 01:30:49.373
I'm really, really sorry, Will.

01:30:49.465 --> 01:30:52.173
Please try to accept my apology

01:30:52.235 --> 01:30:57.309
because the last thing that I intended
was for you to get hurt.

01:30:57.373 --> 01:31:02.186
You've just always protected me,
and I was trying to protect you…

01:31:02.245 --> 01:31:06.694
“from the girl that
I thought Joanna was.

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:10.094
But she's not that gm anymore.

01:31:10.987 --> 01:31:13.558
She's really not.

01:31:13.656 --> 01:31:18.002
She's a girl who loves you
very, very much.

01:31:19.662 --> 01:31:21.903
And you love her, too, dummy.

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.943
And that's all that matters

01:31:34.043 --> 01:31:35.886
I'm really sorry.

01:31:47.557 --> 01:31:52.111
I guess we'll just have to wait it out,
'cause I told Will the truth.

01:31:53.863 --> 01:31:56.526
–I don't Know what else…
–No! Will and Joanna!

01:31:56.566 --> 01:31:57.760
They're up in the tree house!

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.929
Why are you flipping out?
That's a good thing.

01:31:59.969 --> 01:32:03.266
–They're probably hugging it out.
–No, I didn't want him

01:32:03.306 --> 01:32:07.236
to give the tree house to her so
I was gonna take it apart and hide it!

01:32:07.276 --> 01:32:09.706
Where did you suppose you were
gonna hide the tree house?

01:32:09.746 --> 01:32:12.454
Look, the point is,
I loosened the bolts,

01:32:12.548 --> 01:32:14.892
but didn't get a chance to finish.

01:32:15.651 --> 01:32:16.789
That's not good.

01:32:16.886 --> 01:32:20.163
Hey, guys! Cam you
come down here for a second?

01:32:20.256 --> 01:32:22.118
We have to talk to you!
It's important!

01:32:22.158 --> 01:32:26.766
–Sure. How's it going, guys'?
–Hi, guys!

01:32:26.829 --> 01:32:28.391
–We're good!
–You know what,

01:32:28.431 --> 01:32:30.626
this is kind of important, too, so we're
gonna be down in a minute, all right?

01:32:30.666 --> 01:32:33.896
–Just give us one second.
–Yeah, we'll be down. Come on.

01:32:33.936 --> 01:32:36.774
You're gonna be down
sooner than you think.

01:32:44.747 --> 01:32:47.276
Well, darlings,
at least you're together.

01:32:47.316 --> 01:32:49.879
–I'm so sorry, you guys.
–What are you sorry for, Marni?

01:32:49.919 --> 01:32:52.148
Mom said it was probably termites,
and the;I've been meaning to get

01:32:52.188 --> 01:32:53.616
that tree checked out anyways, you know?

01:32:53.656 --> 01:32:56.466
Termites are the silent killers.

01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.999
–Tammy!
–Hey, girl.

01:33:00.096 --> 01:33:02.158
Hi, honey. So, what's the update?

01:33:02.198 --> 01:33:04.627
Well, good news.
Your broken bones are gonna heal.

01:33:04.667 --> 01:33:07.477
–That's good.
–The bad news:

01:33:07.537 --> 01:33:10.243
we're gonna have to
postpone the wedding.

01:33:10.606 --> 01:33:13.840
I'm Sorry, nobody is
leaving this hospital today.

01:33:13.876 --> 01:33:17.673
Except for all of you. OK,
everybody out. These two need some rest.

01:33:17.713 --> 01:33:19.675
–Dad, that's ridiculous…
–Doctor's orders.

01:33:19.715 --> 01:33:21.410
You guys.
You do not have to leave,

01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:24.454
Everybody out.

01:33:39.335 --> 01:33:40.712
Joanna?

01:33:42.505 --> 01:33:46.043
Joanna? Joanna?

01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:49.349
Wakey wakey. Eggs and bakey.

01:33:54.083 --> 01:33:57.860
My dress.
What's. What's going on?

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.228
Trust me.

01:34:00.823 --> 01:34:02.671
Seriously, what is going on?

01:34:02.725 --> 01:34:05.706
–Don't peek.
–I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

01:34:05.761 --> 01:34:07.790
–I'm serious,
–OK, but what's going on?

01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:10.003
If I find out you peeked…

01:34:10.066 --> 01:34:13.275
–Just, just. OK, all right.
–Are you OK?

01:34:13.369 --> 01:34:16.407
–I can open? Can I open?
–Yes. Open.

01:34:20.042 --> 01:34:23.506
I know it's not the fairy tale wedding
that you always planned in your head,

01:34:23.546 --> 01:34:25.787
but, hopefully…

01:34:28.017 --> 01:34:29.792
It's perfect.

01:34:29.886 --> 01:34:32.081
–How do I look?
–You look beautiful.

01:34:32.121 --> 01:34:33.725
Oh, wow…

01:34:33.789 --> 01:34:36.065
Well, you look magnifique, too.

01:34:36.125 --> 01:34:40.811
Which is good, because there's somebody
here who would like to see you.

01:34:45.568 --> 01:34:47.707
Richie Phillips?

01:34:49.138 --> 01:34:51.049
Wow.

01:34:51.107 --> 01:34:55.078
You haven't changed
a bit since high school.

01:34:55.144 --> 01:34:58.785
Hopefully I've changed a little.

01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:02.429
Welcome home.

01:35:03.486 --> 01:35:04.726
Are you ready?

01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:10.164
Marni, will you
walk me down the aisle?

01:35:14.563 --> 01:35:16.565
I would be honored to.

01:35:18.901 --> 01:35:21.939
I can't guarantee I won't trip.

01:35:23.839 --> 01:35:25.182
Hm-hm.

01:35:39.488 --> 01:35:40.933
Aw…

01:36:00.876 --> 01:36:04.106
Maybe one of these days
we'll be dancing at your wedding.

01:36:04.146 --> 01:36:06.854
Oh I don't know Grandma. I…

01:36:06.949 --> 01:36:09.412
I think I need to get a boyfriend first.

01:36:09.452 --> 01:36:11.828
It seems to me you already have one.

01:36:13.322 --> 01:36:15.918
Charlie?
No, Charlie's not my boyfriend.

01:36:15.958 --> 01:36:17.938
Charlie thinks I'm a disaster.

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.375
Are you kidding? That boy
can't take his eyes off of you.

01:36:22.465 --> 01:36:26.311
If you don't go for him, I will.

01:36:26.369 --> 01:36:28.815
All right. Easy, tiger.

01:36:32.408 --> 01:36:35.048
On, Joanna?

01:36:35.144 --> 01:36:39.236
On! Mrs Sullivan, I'd like
to introduce you to Will's grandma.

01:36:47.156 --> 01:36:49.932
–Helen?
–Bunny?

01:36:52.061 --> 01:36:55.235
–You again?
–Wait, you two know each other?

01:37:05.207 --> 01:37:07.346
Helen!

01:37:09.378 --> 01:37:12.291
You look nice. Who dressed you,

01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:16.761
the Great Depression?
–You look lovely, Helen.

01:37:16.852 --> 01:37:20.959
I'm so sorry I couldn't
attend your funeral last year.

01:37:23.726 --> 01:37:25.865
Care to dance, miss?

01:37:25.928 --> 01:37:27.805
Yes, I'd love to.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.043
This ain't oven Bunny.

01:37:35.237 --> 01:37:37.415
Don't get up in my grill, sister.

01:37:45.915 --> 01:37:50.455
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Marni Olsen, sister of the groom.

01:37:50.553 --> 01:37:54.350
And now, sister of the bride.
And I struggled for a long time

01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:58.634
with what to get the bride and groom.
And then it hit me.

01:37:58.727 --> 01:38:03.437
Daryl Hall and John Oates.

01:38:07.002 --> 01:38:08.447
That's our song!
