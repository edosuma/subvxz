00:01.080 --> 00:03.960
( Spooky music playing )

00:20.800 --> 00:24.700
( Spooky laughter )

00:24.800 --> 00:26.380
It's great
that even in space

00:26.480 --> 00:28.600
we can all get together
and have our Halloween party.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.180
So, what's your costume,
again?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.020
You know, I'm that guy
in that one movie.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.220
There's a time machine.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.620
What?
Like, the one with the car?

00:34.720 --> 00:37.300
No, there was,
like, a storage locker.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.400
It kind of just looks
like you put on whatever
was in your closet.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.580
No, no.
You know the one.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.820
It was a little indie.
Got a lot of critical acclaim.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.380
All right, guys.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.300
The dome's on autopilot
to the Halloween nebula.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.420
( Cheers )

00:51.520 --> 00:54.060
Well, Sally,
I'm really digging this ââ

00:54.160 --> 00:55.980
a real work of art.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.260
Her enigmatic smile

00:57.360 --> 00:59.940
reminds me of the secrets
we all carry within us.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.340
What are you
supposed to be?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.780
You know, cool guy,
ranch costume.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.220
Think about it.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.780
Ugh, I hate
thinker costumes.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.840
Recap, you excited
about your first Halloween?

01:09.920 --> 01:11.540
I don't feel excitement,

01:11.640 --> 01:13.820
but I had a fearometer
installed just for today.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.860
What's it at so far?

01:14.960 --> 01:16.540
Negativeâfour fears,
Mordecai.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.260
Well, you've never
had Halloween with these guys.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.140
They tell
the scariest stories.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.300
Anyone have a good one?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.420
I have a story.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.860
It's called "Fear Planet."

01:26.960 --> 01:29.780
( Siren blaring )

01:29.880 --> 01:31.700
What's going on?

01:31.800 --> 01:32.780
Computer: <i>Low fuel.</i>

01:32.880 --> 01:34.860
Computer,
where can we get gas?

01:34.960 --> 01:37.660
<i>The nearest fuel</i>
<i>is on Fear Planet,</i>

01:37.760 --> 01:41.300
<i>a planet that makes your</i>
<i>innermost fears come to life.</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:42.540
Fear Planet, huh?

01:42.640 --> 01:44.260
Sounds dangerous.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.500
I mean,
it'll probably be fine.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.740
Looks like
we don't have a choice.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.800
( Alarm buzzing )
<i>Emergency landing activated.</i>

01:50.880 --> 01:53.500
( All scream )

01:53.600 --> 01:56.420
( All grunt )

01:56.520 --> 01:58.620
Huh? Ugh.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.700
Of course we'd have to land
this far from the gas station.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.500
Guess it's up to me
to get the gas.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.100
Benson, maybe
we shouldn't go outside.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.140
Why? I don't see
anything out there.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.900
( Sighs )
Of all the ridiculous things.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.260
Benson: Planet that makes fears
come to life ââ so silly.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.940
I mean, the only thing I'm
afraid of is sharks, anyway,

02:18.040 --> 02:20.860
and this place is boneâdry.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.620
Huh? What was that?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.380
( Wind gusts )

02:25.480 --> 02:27.140
( Chuckles nervously )
See, guys?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.980
What did I tell you ââ Oh.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.540
Just figments
of my imagination.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.100
They can't hurt me, right?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.140
( Screams )

02:35.240 --> 02:38.340
( All screaming )

02:38.440 --> 02:39.940
( Sharks roar )

02:40.040 --> 02:41.140
( Indistinct shouting )

02:41.240 --> 02:43.240
( Panting )
( Sharks roar )

02:47.520 --> 02:48.620
( Gasoline flowing )

02:48.720 --> 02:50.500
Come on. Hurry up, hurry up!
Let's go!

02:50.600 --> 02:53.100
( Sharks roar )

02:53.200 --> 02:55.200
( Benson screams )

02:56.560 --> 02:57.900
( Pump dings )

02:58.000 --> 02:59.860
Somebody's got to
go get that gas can.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.300
I'll do it.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.020
If I can keep my mind clear,
no fears will appear.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.540
( Chuckles )
That's pretty good.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.620
If I keep my mind clear,
no fears will appear.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.500
If I keep my mind clear,
no fears will appear.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.100
Whoa. Look at him.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.300
He's really doing it.
Nothing's happened.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.340
No fears will appear.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.980
I wonder what Skips
is afraid of.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.780
If I can
keep my mind clear ââ

03:23.880 --> 03:26.860
Hey, Skips!
What are you afraid of?!

03:26.960 --> 03:29.940
Bro, go long.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.620
( Disc twirling )

03:31.720 --> 03:34.960
No.
No flyingâdisc freestylers.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.420
Hey. Wait.
What are you ââ Stay back.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.340
No, please. Stop!

03:44.440 --> 03:47.040
I'm afraid of the dark!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.160
Quick, Pops, go through
the alphabet, and name cookies.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.620
Anise cookies, butter cookies,
chocolateâchip cookies...

03:54.720 --> 03:56.720
That'll keep him busy
for a while.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.920
Rock, paper, scissors
for who goes out next?

03:57.760 --> 03:58.900
...fortune cookies...

03:59.000 --> 04:00.820
Ugh!
All right. Fine. I'll go.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.140
...gingerbread...
But if I see anything,
it'll be way worse.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.240
So I'm gonna close my eyes,
and you'll have to guide me.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.780
All right, you're doing good.
Keep going straight.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.820
...kookie,
but spelled with a "K"...

04:09.920 --> 04:11.920
You're doing great,
buddy!

04:13.760 --> 04:15.580
Almost there!
All right, you made it!

04:15.680 --> 04:19.980
The can's on your right!
...oatmeal cookies...

04:20.080 --> 04:22.740
All right,
so far I've kept my mind clear.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.700
...quarzamali cookies...

04:24.800 --> 04:27.220
Oh, no.
Dude, I'm really sorry!

04:27.320 --> 04:28.860
What did you do, Rigby?

04:28.960 --> 04:30.180
It just popped into my head.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.780
My greatest fear ââ

04:31.880 --> 04:34.080
amusementâpark mascots!

04:37.600 --> 04:39.820
What? Aah!

04:39.920 --> 04:41.340
( Panting )

04:41.440 --> 04:43.340
( Shark roars )
A shark?

04:43.440 --> 04:45.220
That's one of Benson's fears.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.460
I'm scared of other people's
fears now, too.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.020
Like flyingâdisc
freestylers.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.300
Skips was right.
They are creepy.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.400
( Screams )

04:56.840 --> 04:58.340
( Gasoline flowing )

04:58.440 --> 04:59.940
( Panting )

05:00.040 --> 05:01.580
Go, go, go, go, go!

05:01.680 --> 05:03.500
What? Where's the key?
Where's the key?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.840
( Key jingling )

05:09.600 --> 05:11.780
( All scream )

05:11.880 --> 05:16.380
And then more flyingâdisc
freestylers show up,

05:16.480 --> 05:20.220
and they hit them, they
hit them, and they hit them.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.140
Skips, was this
just your way of saying

05:22.240 --> 05:24.060
you don't like
flyingâdisc freestylers?

05:24.160 --> 05:26.700
They're wobbly
and unpredictable.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.660
Who knows
where that disc will end up?

05:28.760 --> 05:29.940
Did it scare you, Recap?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.900
My fearometer
gave it two fears.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.340
Wow. Two out of four fears.
That's a lot.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.140
2 out of 1,000 fears.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.140
This is more scared
than I've ever been.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.820
I'm very impressed and thankful.
Goodnight.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.340
Wait. Hold on.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.860
I think you'll have a hard time
turning your bat on this one.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.220
I don't own any bats,

05:48.320 --> 05:50.320
and it seems they would be
very hard to steer.

05:50.080 --> 05:50.980
No, it's ââ

05:51.080 --> 05:52.420
Nânever mind.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.740
So there we were,
trickâorâtreating,

05:54.840 --> 05:56.580
and things were going great.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.740
What a great haul.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.840
People seem to
mostly be giving out

05:59.280 --> 06:01.280
quinoa, gorp,
and toothbrushes.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.220
It's not ideal to me,
but like Eileen always says...

06:03.320 --> 06:06.500
All: You can't put a price
on proper dental hygiene.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.180
( Chuckling )
Oh, you guys.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.280
I still want candy,
though,

06:09.480 --> 06:11.480
'cause that's
a core part of who I am.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.420
( Gasps )
Dude, check it out.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.620
( Dramatic organ music plays )

06:15.720 --> 06:18.660
( Thunder crashes, wolf howls )

06:18.760 --> 06:20.460
"Kingâsize candy bars
inside"?

06:20.560 --> 06:22.300
But what about
that other sign?

06:22.400 --> 06:26.580
"Dome quarantined
umpire infestation"?

06:26.680 --> 06:27.940
That's perfect!

06:28.040 --> 06:30.040
Baseball games
have tons of great food,

06:29.480 --> 06:31.220
and this place
has kingâsize candy.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.860
That's four peanutâbutter cups
per pack instead of two.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
Oh, yeah. That's true.
Wow. Great value.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.700
That's a pretty good deal.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.780
Hmm. Wait up!

06:38.880 --> 06:41.800
( Thunder crashing )

06:49.640 --> 06:51.140
Trick or treat.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.340
Hello?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.940
We're here
for your candy, bro!

06:57.040 --> 06:58.580
If you say you
have a free thing,

06:58.680 --> 07:00.020
it's illegal
not to give it out.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.700
Mm.
You guys, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.880
I'm not leaving without those
kingâsize peanutâbutter cups

07:05.960 --> 07:09.480
I was kind of promised.
Let's try the kitchen.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.460
Something
doesn't seem right.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.580
It could be the late 1400s'
eastern European

07:14.680 --> 07:15.940
gothic stylings,

07:16.040 --> 07:17.700
but maybe I'm mistaking

07:17.800 --> 07:20.000
the media's vilification of
certain architectural elements

07:20.080 --> 07:20.980
as my own opinion.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.060
I think it's cozy.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.460
Kind of reminds me

07:23.560 --> 07:25.780
of my mom's place
but with more mosquitos.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.580
âMosquitos?
âYeah,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.660
like that one
that just landed on my neck.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.220
( Gasps )
( Screams )

07:32.320 --> 07:33.180
( Screams )

07:33.280 --> 07:34.380
I don't understand

07:34.480 --> 07:36.060
singleâuse kitchenware.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.420
Why get a tiny skillet
that can only cook one egg

07:38.520 --> 07:40.220
when you can get
a normal skillet

07:40.320 --> 07:41.940
that can cook
a lot of things?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.820
Aah!

07:44.920 --> 07:47.540
That sign on the gate
didn't say "umpires."

07:47.640 --> 07:48.700
It said "vampires"!

07:48.800 --> 07:49.980
Whaâaâaât?
Come on.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.660
Garlic! We need garlic!

07:52.760 --> 07:56.140
Wait. Perfect.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.420
( Hisses )
( All scream )

07:58.520 --> 08:00.520
Quick ââ
take these.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.820
Garlic mashed potatoâoâoes!

08:04.920 --> 08:06.020
( Both hiss )

08:06.120 --> 08:07.300
( Bats squeaking )

08:07.400 --> 08:09.400
( All panting )

08:11.120 --> 08:12.100
Huh?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.300
Mashed potatoes
with chives?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.700
( Grunts, screams )

08:16.800 --> 08:18.800
All: Skips!

08:20.640 --> 08:22.640
Huh?

08:25.240 --> 08:27.240
Everybody, weapon up!

08:31.960 --> 08:32.980
An eye patch, Rigby?

08:33.080 --> 08:35.080
Yeah,
I'm kind of feeling it.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.980
( Both hiss )
Run!

08:38.080 --> 08:40.080
( Hisses )

08:44.800 --> 08:46.580
It's
the kingâsize candy bars.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.940
( Vampires growl )

08:49.040 --> 08:50.420
No, Rigby,
it's too dangerous.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.940
We came all this way.
I'm not leaving without 'em.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.100
Dude, get me two!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
I don't care
what the sign says!

08:58.600 --> 09:00.540
( Hisses )
No!

09:00.640 --> 09:01.500
( Grunts )

09:01.600 --> 09:03.600
Huh? Wha?

09:05.480 --> 09:06.420
Aah!

09:06.520 --> 09:07.700
( Hisses )

09:07.800 --> 09:09.140
( Growls )

09:09.240 --> 09:10.220
( Laughs )

Aah!

( Grunts )

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
Rigby!

09:23.520 --> 09:25.500
I got the peanutâbutter cups!
Wait.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.140
These aren't kingâsize.
They're countâsize!

09:28.240 --> 09:30.220
( Hisses )

09:30.320 --> 09:32.220
No! No!

09:32.320 --> 09:34.480
Noâoâo!

09:36.640 --> 09:38.980
Okay, but
so then you are an umpire?

09:39.080 --> 09:43.900
I was, but now I am a vampire
umpire ââ a vumpire.

âOh, I get it.
âSure that makes sense.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.020
Man, this candy
doesn't taste good at all.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.580
Yeah, once you're a vampire,
you pretty much only want blood.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.820
the moral implications
of what we were doing

10:09.920 --> 10:13.900
and decided to work out a deal
with the local blood bank.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.700
The end.
What do you think, Recap?

10:15.800 --> 10:17.420
Well,
I don't have any blood,

10:17.520 --> 10:20.220
so I couldn't really find an
entry point for me in the story.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.140

seems to be stuck at two.

affecting our path.

but what are we looking at?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.380
It's a black hole, Rigby!

10:58.480 --> 11:01.260
We'll be pulled into
the event horizon in 15 minutes

11:01.360 --> 11:03.260

On it.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.460
Oh, this is terrible.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.860
What happen if
we're sucked into a black hole?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.500
Well, one theory says

11:10.600 --> 11:13.180
that we would just travel
to another part of the universe.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.580
Another is that
as we approach the singularity,

11:15.680 --> 11:18.020
we'll be stretched
as thin as strands of spaghetti.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.300
This spaghettification,
as it were,

11:20.400 --> 11:23.060
would be horrible agony
and pain forever.

<i>The only way we could see</i>
<i>out of this rough patch</i>

11:50.800 --> 11:52.500
<i>was to bring in</i>
<i>some extra income.</i>

11:52.600 --> 11:54.860
<i>But finding a roommate</i>
<i>wasn't easy.</i>

11:54.960 --> 11:56.860
So, do you have
a lot of guests over?

11:56.960 --> 11:58.900
I mean,
we're not opposed to visitors.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.580
It's just that we have a lot
of people in the house already,

12:01.680 --> 12:02.540

Would you spend
a lot of time out on the town,

12:08.960 --> 12:10.660
or are you at home more?

12:10.760 --> 12:13.940
More time at home.
I'm really into scrapbooking.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.580
I always keep a lock of hair
from the roommates I eat.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.680

there's one more.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.320
Oh, hello.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.700
Okay, let's get down
to the interview, then.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.820
Do you have any weird habits
we should know about?

12:43.920 --> 12:46.260
Do you, like, play the bassoon
in the middle of the night

12:46.360 --> 12:48.140
or anything?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.240

Huddle!

12:53.280 --> 12:55.260
I don't know.
She seems kind of creepy.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.860
Doesn't seem to be
the most articulate, either.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.540
But she can pay
the rent.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.780
âThat's all that matters.
âYes.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.880

19:54.360 --> 19:55.580
Guys!

19:55.680 --> 19:58.100
We weren't able to steer
away from the black hole.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.900
We're going in!

20:00.000 --> 20:02.920
( All screaming )

20:09.400 --> 20:11.300
âHuh?
âAre we alive?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.700
It's spaghettification.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.800
This is what happens
in a black hole.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.440
âCould be worse.
âDoesn't hurt.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.640
â( Laughs )
âYeah, it's not that bad.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
âPretty cool.
âI'm still looking good.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.300
But wait ââ
Where's Pops?

20:20.400 --> 20:23.140
Yooâhooâhoo!
Over here!

20:23.240 --> 20:25.900
Spaghettiâ
andâmeatballification.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.940
Cool. Huh?

20:28.040 --> 20:29.100
It's...

20:29.200 --> 20:31.780
( Sniffs )
Parmesan...cheese?

20:31.880 --> 20:34.900
( All screaming )

20:35.000 --> 20:36.260
No! No!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.620
( Screaming )

20:37.720 --> 20:39.060
Good evening.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.540
I'm astrophysicist
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.880
What are you doing?
You got to save us!
Just save us!
Save us!

20:43.960 --> 20:45.740
Oh, you can't be saved now.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.900
You see, when you entered
the black hole's event horizon,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.140
your destiny was sealed
by science

20:52.240 --> 20:54.380
and then finished up by me,

20:54.480 --> 20:56.500
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
All: No!

20:56.600 --> 20:58.580
Sorry, guys.
It's nothing personal.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.340
This is just
how the universe works.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.600
Spaghettification is real.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.380
( Belches )
And delicious.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.780
Happy Halloween!

21:08.880 --> 21:11.140
( Eerie tones play )
