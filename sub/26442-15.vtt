Oh, they're definitely hiding
something from us.

Please.

I need to get home now."

Stop pressuring me.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.165
Look at us.
What are we doing?

If we turn on each other,
the fog wins.

"Izzy is home alone
with Mom.

I'm begging you."

I'm not risking your life
by driving through that.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.443
But I can offer you this:

09:03.476 --> 09:06.580
I'll drive around the perimeter
of the fog.

Okay, home is that way.

she will lead us there.

Yeah, bad news.

The other way it is.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.099
Well,
we got the shape right.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.269
The question is,
will he remember the size?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.773
At a certain point, this
cheeseball is just evidence.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.443
I meant
we should split it.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.712
Well, we have to make
another one.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.447
What was in it?
I don't know.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.382
It's a secret

generation to generation.

All I know is in it
is love.

Well, there's this
cheeseball recipe

that Jimmy circled.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.794
It'll have to do.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.763
We promised JJ tonight
would go well,

09:55.796 --> 09:57.798
but we need to get to
the bottom of this text.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.600
Oh, we'll cover the text.
And so much more.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.836
Buy me ten minutes
to prepare.

What are you gonna do?

I'll tell you right now,
I will testify against you.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.442
It's game night.
Let's play a game.

"Revelations:
The Game of Truths"?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.180
It's nice to meet you,
by the way.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.815
Yeah, yeah.
Let's play.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.184
I've never heard
of this game before.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.819
It's very easy:
you just take the tokens

10:18.852 --> 10:21.154
and you move through
the revelation zones:

10:21.188 --> 10:23.423
past plans, future plans,
hard truths,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.192
hypotheticals,
physical challenge.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.459
Wow.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.161
That's part
of the game, too.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.197
Pretending it's the first time
you've seen it.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.266
Yes, so that is a bag
of truth gold for me.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.204
Right, now, everyone
put on your honesty band.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.206
They turn red
if you lie.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.042
And I shall place
the hammer of falsity

10:42.075 --> 10:43.777
in the middle
of the game

10:43.811 --> 10:46.714
and hope we never have
to use it.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.782
How did you make this
in ten minutes?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.283
With a mother's love
for her son.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.618
But, like,
we don't have a printer.

you've ever done?

It hasn't stopped yet.
Doesn't matter.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.530
Oh, yeah,
actually, I can

11:03.563 --> 11:06.133
because my whole attitude
about the fog and darkness

11:06.166 --> 11:07.467
has suddenly changed,

of this scenario.

is mine.

getting my driver's license,

16:28.021 --> 16:30.323

how you won't.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.691
It makes no sense.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.470
Ugh.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.442
"The fog is lifting."

17:22.475 --> 17:24.211
Yeah, it really is.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.946
I'm glad we finally got
to talk about this.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.048
"I meant literally."

17:29.082 --> 17:31.751
Oh, yeah,
no, I-I knew that.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.222
Emotional fog?
What are we, a couple of girls?

17:35.255 --> 17:38.091
"No..."
M-I-- "...misogyny."

17:38.125 --> 17:40.260
You remembered.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.196
Hey, that looks like the mailbox
Mom hit with her car.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.065
And is that the lamppost Mom
hit with her car?

17:46.099 --> 17:47.767
And the car Mom hit
with her car...

17:47.800 --> 17:49.469
We're just a couple blocks
from home!

17:50.803 --> 17:53.606
"Follow the things
Mom hit with her car."

17:53.640 --> 17:56.276
No wonder I'm such
a terrible driver.
[ JJ laughs ]

17:56.309 --> 17:58.645
Okay, so, here we are
at the bargaining table.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.147
No.
You're kidnapping me.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.449
All right, great.
Let's discuss your proposal.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.750
Please stay.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.552
We'll give you the licensing
rights to the game.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.953
Domestic.

18:06.986 --> 18:09.122
Would a bribe help?
See this jar of change?

18:09.156 --> 18:10.790
It is all yours.

18:10.823 --> 18:11.991
Where are the quarters?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.593
Oh, wow.
You are good at this.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.995
Well, here it is.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.398
Jimmy's famous cheeseball!

18:18.431 --> 18:20.567
Yes, this will
make you love us.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.101
It looks bigger
than usual.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.003
It's just closer
to your face.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.173
Oh, no!
My side is slipping!

18:26.206 --> 18:28.708
Oh, as is my side!

18:30.643 --> 18:32.145
[ Grunts ]

18:32.845 --> 18:35.348
[ Breathing heavily ]

18:35.382 --> 18:38.485
Got it.
Fastest you've ever moved
in your whole damn life!

18:38.518 --> 18:41.120
[ Chuckles ] Good D.
Good -- Good D, Jimmy.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.290
Yeah?
I'm okay, actually.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.493
Izzy, if there's one thing
we miserable retches can do,

18:46.526 --> 18:49.862
it's make a party cheeseball
that radiates with love.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.164
Please eat?

18:51.198 --> 18:52.499
-Or don't.
-Or don't.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.769
[ Spits ]

18:56.803 --> 18:58.271
Ew!
That's gross!

18:58.305 --> 18:59.472
Is that clay?!

18:59.506 --> 19:02.809
Bingo! [ Chuckles ]
Super-taster over here.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.378
I mean,
it's clay and dog food.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.447
Wh-- I'm not gonna use
all my clay.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.481
I play with that.
[ Door opens ]

19:08.515 --> 19:10.049
What is wrong
with you people?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.520
Ray:
"You're still here."
Hi.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.688
"I was worried
they scared you off."

19:15.722 --> 19:17.690
[ Both laugh nervously ]

19:17.724 --> 19:20.360
That's rich.
You are a...card.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.196
"Do you have
a venereal disease?"

19:23.230 --> 19:26.233
I mean, not that card.
Just a card in general.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.201
What took so long?
Is everything okay?

19:28.235 --> 19:31.170
I will try to find the right
time to answer that question.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.707
"Has it been okay?"

19:36.443 --> 19:38.945
Your parents made me...

19:42.449 --> 19:45.252
...feel very welcome.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.687
You have to have a little more
faith in us, JJ.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.023
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
We were awful.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.526
We grilled her,
we invaded her privacy,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.428
we fed her dog food...

19:55.462 --> 19:56.829
Yeah, I don't know why
you made us meet her.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.266
Kenneth:
"Aw, come on, Wolfman!"

19:59.299 --> 20:01.701
No, no, it's not
The Wolfman's fault.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.770
I read your text to Izzy.
I freaked.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.439
Of course you guys are allowed
to have secrets.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.908
"Actually, no,
Ray showed me

20:08.941 --> 20:13.079
it's better to come clean with
the stuff you're holding onto.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.682
That's when
the fog clears."

20:15.715 --> 20:16.916
Metaphorically?

20:16.949 --> 20:19.786
Well, good.
'Cause you can tell us anything.

20:19.819 --> 20:23.690
And we're not afraid she's gonna
take you away from us.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.459
Kenneth: "Izzy's going to
college in New York."

20:26.493 --> 20:28.461
Well, why wouldn't we understand
that, darling?

20:28.495 --> 20:31.764
"I want to go to film school
there."

20:35.768 --> 20:39.038
Okay, good,
I wrecked my car.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.341
Whew.
That's a load off.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.778
New York? But how would
that even be possible?

20:45.812 --> 20:47.280
And when were you
going to tell us?

20:47.314 --> 20:49.949
Well, how is that a question
about sports and entertainment?

20:49.982 --> 20:53.453
"I figured I wouldn't apply
because I was afraid

20:53.486 --> 20:55.822
to tell you,
but I really want to go."

20:55.855 --> 20:58.157
What did you do to
all of my games?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.926
"Well? Can I go?"

20:59.959 --> 21:01.227
Can you go?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.763
We were worried about you
going to school an hour away.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.932
This is a much longer
conversation.

21:05.965 --> 21:09.168
"I still have to fill out
an application.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.970
And make a film.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.505
By tomorrow."

21:14.341 --> 21:15.608
Bombshell bonus.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.076
You win "Revelations"!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.511
Best two out of three?
