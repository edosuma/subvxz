WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:05.439
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME FIVE YEARS
AGO THAT I, DANIEL CASTELLANO,

00:05.473 --> 00:07.208
WOULD BE DATING MINDY LAHIRI,

00:07.241 --> 00:08.509
I WOULD HAVE SAID,
"OH,

00:08.542 --> 00:11.179
IS EVERYONE ELSE
ON THE PLANET DEAD?"

00:11.212 --> 00:13.314
I WAS KIND OF A DICK BACK THEN.
WHAT?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.182
OH, MY--HEY.

00:14.215 --> 00:17.451
(Danny)
SURE, THERE WERE UPS AND DOWNS,

00:17.485 --> 00:19.620
BUT WE FINALLY FOUND EACH OTHER.

00:19.653 --> 00:20.888
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

00:20.921 --> 00:24.292
ME, THE MAN THAT THOUGHT THAT
LOVE HAD FORSAKEN HIM, FINALLY--

00:24.325 --> 00:27.361
SHUT UP AND DO ME.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.264
(Mindy)
AFTER YEARS OF DATING LOSERS
AND SOCIOPATHS,

00:30.298 --> 00:32.633
I'M NOW HAPPILY DATING
THE MAN OF MY DREAMS,

00:32.666 --> 00:36.370
A DEVOUT CATHOLIC DIVORCEE WITH
SOME PRETTY SERIOUS DAD ISSUES,

00:36.404 --> 00:39.140
WHICH, FOR A SINGLE 30-SOMETHING
WOMAN, IS NOT TOO SHABBY.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.075
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.
CANTALOUPE?

00:41.109 --> 00:42.776
I'VE HAD TO MOVE
OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.378
VERY SWEET.
THANK YOU.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.848
[gagging]
YOU OKAY?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.750
MM--MM-HMM.
NO, IT'S GOOD.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.252
AND DANNY HAS HAD
TO CHANGE TOO.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.221
DANNY, PLEASE COME OUT.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.522
[sighs]

00:56.657 --> 00:58.159
BUT WHAT IS A RELATIONSHIP

00:58.192 --> 01:01.262
IF NOT DOING THINGS YOU HATE
IN BETWEEN SEX SESSIONS?

01:04.365 --> 01:06.334
AND SPEAKING OF SEX,

01:06.367 --> 01:07.868
I'VE LEARNED
THAT DANNY GETS TURNED ON

01:07.901 --> 01:10.104
BY SOME PRETTY UNUSUAL MUSIC.

01:10.138 --> 01:13.241
[Boston's More Than a Feeling]

01:13.274 --> 01:15.209
* IT'S MORE THAN A FEELING

01:15.243 --> 01:17.411
* MORE THAN A FEELING

01:17.445 --> 01:20.214
* WHEN I HEAR THAT OLD SONG
THEY USED TO PLAY *

01:20.248 --> 01:22.250
* MORE THAN A FEELING

01:22.283 --> 01:24.352
* I BEGIN DREAMING

01:24.385 --> 01:25.686
* MORE THAN A FEELING

01:25.719 --> 01:28.456
* TILL I SEE MY MARIANNE
WALK *

01:28.489 --> 01:37.365

(Danny)
YEAH?

01:40.934 --> 01:41.835
HEY, DANNY, CAN I HAVE

01:41.869 --> 01:43.704
YOUR PROFESSIONAL
OPINION ON SOMETHING?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.606
I NEED SOMEONE
OF YOUR EXPERTISE.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.241
OF COURSE.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.677
I WAS HOPING YOU'D ASK ME
HOW TO BE A BETTER DOCTOR, PETE.

01:49.710 --> 01:54.515
NOW, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

01:55.616 --> 01:57.285
I HEARD YOU'RE GOOD
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.419
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:58.452 --> 02:01.455
I HEARD YOU'RE, UM...

02:01.489 --> 02:03.857
I HEARD YOU'RE GOOD
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.293
[object clatters]

02:05.326 --> 02:06.360
WHAT?

02:06.394 --> 02:07.795
MINDY TOLD ME.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.631
AND AS YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
GIVEN A WOMAN AN ORGASM.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.401
SHE SAYS YOU'RE LIKE A THIRSTY
CAMEL AT A DESERT OASIS.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.636
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S REFERRING
TO A TECHNIQUE, OR...

02:18.372 --> 02:19.707
WHERE'S MINDY?

02:19.740 --> 02:22.310
SHE'S IN THE STAFF MEETING
THAT STARTED FIVE MINUTES AGO.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.945
BETTER GET THAT HOT
LITTLE TONGUE OF YOURS IN THERE.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.280
WHAT?

02:27.781 --> 02:29.650
[whispering]
HEY, WHAT THE HELL?

02:29.683 --> 02:30.884
(Jeremy)
DANNY, TAKE A SEAT.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.354
THANK YOU FOR COMING
TO THIS IMPORTANT MEETING.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.956
EVERY YEAR I TRY TO GET
A CHARITY INITIATIVE GOING.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.260
EVERY YEAR, WITHOUT FAIL,
NO ONE WANTS TO HELP ME.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.528
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.862
I AM MAD CHARITABLE.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.331
I DONATED TWO CANS OF SOUP

02:43.364 --> 02:44.732
TO GET INTO
A KATY PERRY Q&A.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.400
THIS YEAR, THEREFORE,

02:46.434 --> 02:50.238
I'M HOLDING A FUNDRAISER
FOR OUR FAVORITE CHARITY

02:50.271 --> 02:51.939
WITH MY OLD COLLEGE CHUM,
LAUREN.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.207
HI.
(Peter)
YEAH.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.376
THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
[chuckles]

02:55.409 --> 02:56.644
GIVE IT A TWIRL, GIRL.
NO. NO, BABE.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.912
(Peter)
SHOW EVERYBODY.
NO, BABE. SHH, SHH, SHH.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.748
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE
ALL PARTICIPATING IN THIS,

CARE TO THE THIRD WORLD.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.888
WHAT ABOUT MY WORLD?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.657
OUR PPO WOULDN'T COVER
MY COLORED BRACES

03:09.690 --> 03:11.859
'CAUSE THEY WERE
"MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY."

03:11.892 --> 03:13.427
THOSE CUTE LITTLE BRACES
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT?

03:13.461 --> 03:15.263
YEAH.
OKAY. THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.497
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHY THAT HAPPENED.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.633
BECAUSE MEN...
CONTROL HEALTHCARE.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.901
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

03:20.934 --> 03:22.436
IF THERE WERE BRACES
FOR YOUR PENIS,

03:22.470 --> 03:24.338
WE WOULD NOT BE
IN THIS SITUATION.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.240
(Peter)
OKAY, THAT--
HOW ABOUT A CHARITY...

03:26.274 --> 03:28.342
THAT HELPS GIRLS WHO WANT
TO LOOK BANGABLE AT WORK?

03:28.376 --> 03:31.279
"BRACES FOR PENISES"
IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL IT.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.547
THAT'S--THIS IS NOT--
(Beverly)
I CAN'T GO.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.782
I HAVE TICKETS
TO AN EXECUTION.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.918
HMM.
I CAN GO BUT CANNOT PAY.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.787
AND I NEED SOMEONE TO KEEP ME
COMPANY WHILE I'M THERE.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.289
DR. C,
YOU'RE STARING RIGHT AT ME.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.290
THE JOB IS YOURS.
NO, NO, NO.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.258
I WAS LOOKING AT YOU
BECAUSE YOU WERE TALKING.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.694
NEVERTHELESS.
[whispers] WRAP IT UP.
DAMN IT.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.829
(Jeremy)
I'M GONNA SHUT THIS DOWN
BEFORE IT SPIRALS.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.499
I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN A COUPLE
OF DAYS, LAUREN'S APARTMENT.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.600
EVERYBODY GET BACK TO WORK.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.234
EVERYONE, GET BACK TO WORK.
GOOD MEETING, THOUGH.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.305
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING EVERYBODY
ABOUT ME?
EVERYTHING!

03:57.338 --> 03:58.572
YOU'RE WELCOME, BY THE WAY.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.574
I MOVED THE ROUTER UP HIGH SO
YOU WOULDN'T TRIP ON THE WIRE.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.476
A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU
SHOULDN'T TRIP ON A CORD,

04:02.510 --> 04:04.044
BUST THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE OPEN.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.713
I THINK YOU HAVE
A VERY NICE FACE YOURSELF.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.648
YOU SHOULD SEE MY CALVES.
WHO ARE YOU?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.350
THIS IS COUSIN LOU.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.285
YOU KNOW, MY COUSIN LOU
I'M ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT,

04:11.319 --> 04:13.454
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "MORGAN,
NO ONE CARES." THIS IS HIM.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.655
THAT'S COUSIN LOU?
(Morgan)
YEAH.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.923
DR. REED HIRED HIM TO DO I.T.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.326
YOU KNOW, WE GET A TAX CREDIT
EVERY TIME WE HIRE AN EX-CON.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.593
WELL, I'M JUST SO HAPPY
TO WORK AT A PLACE

04:19.627 --> 04:22.363
THAT ALLOWS HUNKY DRIFTERS LIKE
YOURSELF TO GET A SECOND CHANCE

04:22.396 --> 04:24.632
FOR HOPEFULLY COMMITTING
A WHITE-COLLAR CRIME?

04:24.665 --> 04:25.933
OH.
OH, NO.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.701
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO. BUT DON'T WORRY.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.438
MORGAN AND I WENT TO JAIL
FOR BOOSTING CARS.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.872
LOOK--
"NO MORE STEALING CARS"

04:31.905 --> 04:33.374
DR. C.
I DON'T--

04:33.407 --> 04:35.343
I STAYED IN JAIL FOR MURDER.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.311
RICHARD LEWIS CAME
TO ENTERTAIN US.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.347
YOU KILLED RICHARD LEWIS?
NO! NO!

04:39.380 --> 04:40.848
THE GUY NEXT TO ME
WAS HECKLING HIM,

04:40.881 --> 04:42.916
SO I STABBED HIM.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.318
HE LOVES RICHARD LEWIS.
YEAH.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.653
OKAY, GUYS, WANT TO STEP OUT

04:45.686 --> 04:46.987
AND JUST GIVE US A MINUTE?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.357
LET ME SAY ONE THING.
COUSIN LOU IS ON THE MARKET.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.359
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF YOU MARRIED MY COUSIN?

04:51.392 --> 04:52.726
THANKSGIVINGS AT YOUR HOUSE.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.095
CHRISTMAS AT YOUR HOUSE.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.830
RAMADAN AT YOUR HOUSE.
BIG MONTH FOR YOU.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.433
I'M NOT INTO THAT AS MUCH.
I'M NOT--I'M NOT--
I'M ALSO NOT--

04:59.467 --> 05:00.634
WELL, SHE IS MUSLIM,
VERY DEVOUT MUSLIM.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.603
I'M NOT. I MEAN,
IT'S FINE TO BE, I'M JUST NOT.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.438
YOU'RE NOT MUSLIM?
NO.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.939
HMM.
IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.940
I THINK THAT'S A NICE OFFER.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.342
OKAY, LOOK, I GET IT.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.077
I'M NOT WELL-READ,
WELL-TRAVELED,

05:10.110 --> 05:11.579
AND OUR FAMILY'S TRASH.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.580
(Morgan)
YEAH.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.847
BUT I'M A WHITE MAN

05:13.881 --> 05:15.449
WHO'S INTERESTED IN YOU.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.754
OKAY, WE DON'T EAT POPSICLES
LIKE THAT HERE.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.055
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD,
HOMEBOY.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.557
I HEARD YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
WITH YOUR MOUTH.
OH!

05:28.161 --> 05:29.062
WHY IS EVERYBODY AT WORK

05:29.096 --> 05:31.465
TALKING ABOUT HOW I'M GOOD
WITH MY MOUTH?

05:31.499 --> 05:32.866
OH, BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.001
[sighs]

05:34.034 --> 05:35.869
WAIT, ARE YOU MAD?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.438
OKAY, DANNY,
YOU CAN JUST TELL EVERYONE

05:37.471 --> 05:38.839
THAT I'M REALLY GOOD
WITH MY MOUTH.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.141
EH...

05:41.174 --> 05:42.676
HOW...DARE YOU?

05:42.710 --> 05:43.611
I MEAN, YOU'RE OKAY.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.580
YOU CERTAINLY THOUGHT
I WAS OKAY LAST NIGHT.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.581
IT WAS BETTER LAST NIGHT.

05:47.615 --> 05:51.084
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
THAT YOU VALUE MY SKILLS,

05:51.118 --> 05:53.787
BUT I CAN'T BE OPEN WITH YOU
IF EVERYTHING I SAY OR DO,

05:53.821 --> 05:55.155
THE WHOLE OFFICE
IS GONNA KNOW.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.524
DANNY, THAT'S WHO I AM.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.825
I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO COME INTO WORK

05:57.858 --> 05:58.792
AND SAY TO EVERYONE,

05:58.826 --> 06:00.127
"DANNY AND I HAD SEX
ON THE SUBWAY LAST NIGHT,"

06:00.160 --> 06:01.962
AND THEN GET
EVERYONE'S TAKE ON IT.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.098
BUT IF THIS IS GONNA WORK OUT,
YOU CAN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.434
REALLY?
YEAH.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.635
OKAY.
YEAH.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.437
I CAN DO THAT.
SURE YOU CAN DO THAT.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.004
I CAN CHANGE
THE VERY CORE OF ME.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.040
OKAY, COME ON, HEY.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.041
YOU CAN DO IT.
HMM.

DANNY, CAN YOU SHOW ME

06:16.744 --> 06:19.146

THE STATEN ISLAND HANDSHAKE?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.048
MINDY SAYS IT MADE HER
PASS OUT.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.049
PETER, I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS ME.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.216
I THINK THAT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE
WHO TOLD YOU THAT.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.085
NO, YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA MELT

06:25.118 --> 06:27.154
IN YOUR DUVET COVER,
REMEMBER?

06:27.187 --> 06:29.156
HMM.
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE ME.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.795
DAMN IT.
HAS ANYONE SEEN MY TALC?

06:34.828 --> 06:36.797
I NEED IT. IT'S HUMID.

06:36.830 --> 06:41.001
OKAY, JUST RETURN IT,
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.871
(Lauren)
WHAT ABOUT
THIS CATERING COMPANY?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.813
DANNY, DO YOU HAVE
ANY T-SHIRTS

06:52.846 --> 06:54.915
THAT ARE NOT A BOY'S SIZE
MEDIUM?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.917
EH, IF YOU GOT IT, FLAUNT IT.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.952
RIGHT, WELL, THAT DOESN'T
REALLY HELP ME VERY MUCH.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.088
OH, GUESS WHO KEPT HER MOUTH
SHUT ALL DAY

07:01.121 --> 07:02.656
ABOUT OUR PERSONAL BUSINESS?

07:02.690 --> 07:03.891
LIKE, LAST NIGHT,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.859
HOW WHEN YOU CLIMAXED YOU
SAID, "WHOA, NELLY"?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.127
I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.562
THANK YOU.
AND, AS A REWARD...

07:08.596 --> 07:12.900
I HAVE SOME...
VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.202
IS THIS BORING,
LIKE ALL THE STATES' CAPITALS?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.838
NO. YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE.

07:17.871 --> 07:18.872
OKAY. I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.774
WAIT, IS THIS GOSSIP?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.510
NO, I'M NOT GOSSIPING.
I DON'T DO THAT.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.578
THIS IS JUST ME REPORTING

07:24.612 --> 07:26.814
THE QUESTIONABLE GOINGS-ON
OF PEOPLE WE KNOW.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.081
OKAY.
SO TONIGHT...

07:28.115 --> 07:29.883

MY REGULAR GYM...

07:32.720 --> 07:34.922

07:37.825 --> 07:39.493
USUALLY ON WEDNESDAYS,
I LIKE TO GO--

07:39.527 --> 07:40.961
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE TELLING THIS SO BADLY.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.262
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT
TERRY LATER.
OKAY.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.797
THE POINT IS,

07:43.831 --> 07:46.767
I SAW LAUREN AND JEREMY ALONE
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.969
AND HE WAS RUBBING HER.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.070
HE WAS HONKING HER BREASTS?

07:50.103 --> 07:52.139
NO, HE WAS RUBBING HER NECK.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.608
WHOA, NELLY.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.577
THERE'S SOMETHING
DEFINITELY GOING ON.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.045
PETER'S NOT DELIVERING
IN THE BEDROOM,

07:58.078 --> 07:59.780
AND THEY'RE PLANNING
THIS CHARITY THING TOGETHER.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.616
I WOULD NEVER LET MY WOMAN PLAN
A CHARITY EVENT WITH SOME GUY.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.917
I WOULD NEVER DO IT.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.754
AND I WOULD NEVER PLAN
A CHARITY EVENT.

08:06.787 --> 08:10.858
DANNY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
INTERPERSONAL CHIT-CHAT.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.059
THANKS.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.961
EXCEPT I DO FEEL BAD
FOR PETER,

08:13.994 --> 08:15.729
BECAUSE HONESTLY, LAUREN'S
THE FIRST GIRLFRIEND HE'S HAD

08:15.763 --> 08:16.930
WHO I HAVEN'T
WANTED TO KILL.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.033
YEAH, IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.535
HEY, DANNY?

08:21.569 --> 08:22.703
YEAH?

08:22.736 --> 08:23.904
WHO IS DIAMOND?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.873
WHOSE DIAMOND WHAT?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.908
UH, DON'T--PUT THAT--
PUT THAT BACK.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.276
DON'T GO THROUGH MY STUFF,
MINDY.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.911
I--I DON'T GO
THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.145
DON'T GO THROUGH MY DRAWERS.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.181
YEAH, BUT I DON'T HAVE PINK
THONGS WITH "DIAMOND" ON THEM.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.883
DOES THIS BELONG
TO YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.284
GOD, SHE MUST HAVE
BEEN REALLY THIN.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.919
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.
JUST PUT IT BACK AND LET'S--

08:38.952 --> 08:40.754
I DON'T EVEN THINK
I COULD FIT THIS ON MY ARM.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.022
DON'T PUT IT ON YOUR ARM.
JUST DROP IT.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.758
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE THINGS FROM
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIENDS, YOU KNOW?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.627
I HAVE A BOX
OF MY EX-BOYFRIEND'S HAIR,

08:46.660 --> 08:47.828
BUT I KEEP IT FOR CURSES.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.864
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE END OF THIS, OKAY?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.700
DANNY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:52.733 --> 08:55.903
I SAID THAT'S THE END OF THAT,
OKAY? DROP IT.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.743
PETER. PETER.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.744
AM I BEING PARANOID?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.913
LAST NIGHT I FOUND
SOMETHING VERY DISTURBING

09:05.946 --> 09:06.914
IN THE BACK
OF DANNY'S DRESSER.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.315
IS HE WEARING
EYELASH EXTENSIONS?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.717
I KNEW IT!

09:09.750 --> 09:10.851
THOSE THINGS ARE WAY
TOO LONG.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.620
THE OTHER DAY, ONE RUBBED
UP AGAINST THE BACK OF MY EAR.

09:12.653 --> 09:16.123
AH, NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
THIS IS WHAT I FOUND.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.262
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.931
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO DISCUSS

09:23.964 --> 09:25.599
WITH SOMEONE OUTSIDE
OF MY RELATIONSHIP.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.667
SO I'M JUST GONNA
GO BACK TO MY OFFICE,

09:26.700 --> 09:29.803
AND I'M GOING TO SPIRAL OUT
ABOUT IT BY MYSELF.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.138
GOOD FOR YOU.
OH, WAIT, BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

09:31.171 --> 09:32.740
CAN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING
REAL QUICK?
OKAY.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.708
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT BUYING THESE FOR LAUREN.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.943
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:35.976 --> 09:38.278
PETER, THOSE ARE HUGE.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.813
ARE THESE REALLY EXPENSIVE?
YES.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.115
DID I HAVE TO DIVEST MYSELF
FROM PUBE STARTUP

09:42.149 --> 09:44.217
IN ORDER TO AFFORD THEM?
DOUBLE YES.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.887
BUT, YOU KNOW,
A CHICK LIKE LAUREN,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.922
SHE COMES AROUND
ONCE A LIFETIME, AND...

09:48.956 --> 09:49.923
I THINK I LOVE HER.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.391
DON'T BUY THOSE EARRINGS.
WHAT?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.093
DON'T BUY THOSE EARRINGS,
PETER, I BEG OF YOU.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.094
WHY?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.296
I JUST FEEL LIKE...

09:56.329 --> 09:58.899
MAYBE LAUREN
DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME WAY.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.334
ABOUT ME?

10:01.368 --> 10:04.204
NO, NOT ABOUT YOU,
NOT ABOUT YOU.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.906
ABOUT JEWELRY.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.975
SHE MIGHT LIKE A--
A DIFFERENT KIND OF JEWELRY.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.944
OKAY.
LIKE WHAT?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.279
LIKE A TIARA.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.682
TIARA. VERY COOL.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.016
'CAUSE SHE'S MY QUEEN.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.718
I LIKE IT.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.419
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE,
MUCH HARDER TO FIND,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.122
BUT I'M IN IT
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.991
OKAY, WELL,
HAPPY THAT I COULD HELP.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.358
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE STRIPPER THONG?

10:25.392 --> 10:26.927
STRIPPER THONG?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.996
YOU KNOW.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.298
SNAPS.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.433
OH, MY GOD.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.202
[text chime]

10:35.235 --> 10:37.037
[chime]

10:45.946 --> 10:47.447
[sighs]
DAMN IT.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.783
I CAN PICTURE DANNY
WITH ANY ONE OF THESE.

10:49.817 --> 10:50.918
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT PICTURES OF STRIPPERS?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.419
WHAT? HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

10:52.452 --> 10:53.987
I CAN SEE THE REFLECTION
IN YOUR EYES.

10:54.021 --> 10:54.722
YOU'RE SUCH A SNOOP.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.823
GOD, YOU CAN'T
BE A STRIPPER.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.457
I MEAN, YOU GOT THE BODY, YEAH.
BUT CAN YOU DANCE?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.458
[mutters]
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.259
OKAY, SHUT UP.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.128
JUST COME IN
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.363
I TRIED TO KEEP MY MOUTH
SHUT THE ENTIRE DAY,

11:03.396 --> 11:05.065
AND I JUST MADE
EVERYTHING WORSE.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.199
I NEED TO TELL YOU THIS,

11:06.233 --> 11:07.400
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ANYBODY.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.937
I FOUND THIS STRIPPER THONG
IN THE BACK OF DANNY'S DRESSER.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.905
AND JEREMY WAS GIVING LAUREN

11:11.939 --> 11:13.874
A SHOULDER RUB
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

11:13.907 --> 11:14.875
A SHOULDER RUB?

11:14.908 --> 11:16.844
I ONLY GIVE A SHOULDER RUB
WHEN I'M EXPECTING

11:16.877 --> 11:18.211
A YOU-KNOW-WHAT RUB
AFTERWARDS.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.847
I KNOW, I KNOW.
A SEX RUB.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.914
I--I KNOW.
SEX RUB.

11:20.948 --> 11:21.949
I SAI--I KNOW.

11:21.982 --> 11:22.983
YOU TALKED OVER ME.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.084
I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE IN A WORLD

11:24.117 --> 11:26.920
WHERE A RUDE SCHLUB
LIKE PETER CAN LOSE HIS WOMAN

11:26.954 --> 11:28.321
TO A HANDSOME, DECENT MAN.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.356
I KNOW!

11:29.389 --> 11:30.523
AND I DON'T WANT
TO WORK IN A PLACE

11:30.557 --> 11:33.260
WHERE DR. C HAS TO HIDE
HIS MAN'S THONG IN HIS DRAWER.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.261
MEN'S THONG?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.362
THIS IS A MEN'S THONG.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.830
LOOK AT THE POUCH
RIGHT HERE.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.198
THIS IS WHERE
THE WIENER WOULD GO.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.801
"HELLO."

11:49.943 --> 11:52.813
"DIAMOND DAN"?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.848
OH, MY GOD.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.283
DANNY IS THE STRIPPER.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.020
(Jeremy)
THANK YOU FOR COMING
TO LAUREN'S.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.054
I'M SURE EVERYONE'S
HAVING A LOVELY TIME

12:01.088 --> 12:02.155
USING THEIR TEETH TONIGHT.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.356
NOW IMAGINE A WORLD

12:03.390 --> 12:05.358
WHERE DENTAL CARE
IS NONEXISTENT.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.128
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MISSING
SHEENA'S TAP RECITAL FOR THIS.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.462
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
TAMRA?

12:09.496 --> 12:10.463
NAH, DR. C,

12:10.497 --> 12:11.398
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.234
FIRST OF ALL, MY PHONE
IS DEAD, AS PER USUAL.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.104
SECONDLY, I THINK IT'S MESSED UP
THAT DR. REED AND DR. THAT-LADY

12:17.137 --> 12:19.807
ARE HOOKING UP BEHIND
DR. PRENTICE'S BACK.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.408
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.542
MORGAN TOLD ME.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.511
HE HEARD IT FROM DR. L.
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.879
(Lauren)
FIRSTHAND TEN YEARS

12:25.913 --> 12:27.214
AGO ON A SERVICE TRIP.
OKAY...

12:27.247 --> 12:28.448
YEAH, I SAID TO LAUREN,

12:28.481 --> 12:31.084
"MY, THESE VILLAGE CHILDREN ARE
SO PHOTOGENIC. WHY IS THAT?"

12:31.118 --> 12:32.319
(Lauren)
WE DISCOVERED IT WAS BECAUSE

12:32.352 --> 12:34.021
DOCTORS WITHOUT MOLARS...
[whispering]
HEY! HEY!

12:34.054 --> 12:35.055
I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO YOU.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.256
OH, ME?
YEAH.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.524
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
GET IN THERE.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.359
GET IN THERE.
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.560
OKAY. AFTER YOU.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.396
GET YOUR BIG ASS
IN THERE NOW.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.365
(both)
WHAT THE HELL?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.400
DID YOU TELL MORGAN
ABOUT JEREMY AND LAUREN?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.104
DID YOU USED TO BE
A STRIPPER?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.974
UH...

12:54.007 --> 12:56.910
[sighs]

12:56.944 --> 12:58.545
OKAY, WE BOTH
DID BAD THINGS.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.512
LET'S GET BACK TO THE PARTY
WHILE--

12:59.546 --> 13:02.415
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T THINK SO, PAL.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.384
I HAVE SPENT
THE LAST DAY AND A HALF

13:04.417 --> 13:07.020
THINKING THAT YOU WERE
OBSESSED WITH AN EX OR WORSE.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.221
IT'S EMBARRASSING, OKAY?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.289
I DID IT TO PAY
FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.258
WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU WORKED
ON A DEEP-SEA FISHING BOAT

13:11.291 --> 13:12.225
TO PAY FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.061
I TRIED. I KEPT GETTING
THROWN FROM THE BOAT

13:14.094 --> 13:15.362
BECAUSE I WAS TOO LIGHT.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.364
DANNY, YOU CAN'T
JUST SHUT DOWN

13:17.397 --> 13:18.531
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SECRET.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.067
OKAY, LOOK, YOU KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.935
BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST YOU
WITH MY SECRETS.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.436
WHY DO YOU HAVE
SO MANY SECRETS, DANNY?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.406
YOU'RE AN OB-GYN.
YOU'RE NOT BATMAN.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.574
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

13:27.607 --> 13:29.910
YOU SAID WE WERE GONNA HANG OUT
AT THE PARTY, DIAMOND DAN.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.912
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.914
I TOLD HIM BECAUSE I--
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE!

13:33.947 --> 13:36.083
I'M OUT THERE TALKING TO SOME
ORTHODONTIST FROM SYOSSET.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.918
YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS

13:37.951 --> 13:39.419
WHEN YOU'RE A TOOKERS.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.454
THERE'S A LOT
OF OTHER PROBLEMS, THOUGH.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.558
DYSLEXIA, ALCOHOLISM,
NO SHORT-TERM MEMORY,

13:45.592 --> 13:47.961
ALCOHOLISM.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.230
EXCUSE ME.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.632
MAN, SO MUCH DRAMA
AT THIS VAGINA CLINIC, HUH?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.935
I KNOW, IT'S A REAL
SOAP OPERA IN HERE.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.469
SPEAKING OF THAT,
DID YOU HEAR

13:56.503 --> 13:59.472
ABOUT LAUREN AND JEREMY
DOING IT BEHIND PETER'S BACK?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.476
I'M PETER.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
YOU'RE PETER, TOO?

14:05.545 --> 14:08.381
NO, I'M TH--I'M THAT PETER.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.050
THE PETER WE'RE
DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.551
OH, MAN, OH.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.453
THAT IS SO EMBARRASSING
FOR ME.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.288
I'M SO SORRY.
NO--

14:15.322 --> 14:17.290
BUT, SERIOUSLY, EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT IT.
OKAY.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.526
YEAH, AND NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
THIS AMAZING DENTAL CHARITY.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.593
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A CRIME.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.395
AND I'M A CRIMINAL, ALL RIGHT?
SO I SHOULD KNOW.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.331
I GOT TO GO
FOR A SECOND.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.134
ALL RIGHT,
YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.469
OH, HEY, GIRL.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.504
MY PHONE IS CHARGING SLOW.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.273
IS THE ELECTRICITY HERE
NORMAL ELECTRICITY,

14:33.306 --> 14:35.976
OR IS IT SOME OF THAT
LOW-FLOW ECO BULL?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.545
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.213
HEY.
HEY.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.950
TAMRA, COULD, UM--
COULD WE HAVE A SECOND ALONE?

14:42.983 --> 14:45.218
SORRY. I GOT TOO MANY
CELEBRITY PHONE NUMBERS.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.254
I CAN'T JUST
BE LEAVING MY PHONE.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.255
OKAY.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.457
WHAT'S UP?
[ahem]

14:50.490 --> 14:52.459
I JUST--I'M GONNA
ASK YOU A QUESTION,

14:52.492 --> 14:55.628
AND I KNOW IT'S CRAZY,
SO JUST HUMOR ME.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.430
DID YOU HAVE SEX
WITH JEREMY?

14:57.464 --> 14:59.299
WHAT?
OF COURSE NOT.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.667
[laughs]
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.070
I MEAN,
HE GAVE ME A BACKRUB.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.372
SO WHAT?
THAT'S NOTHING.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.706
AND THEN WE--WE KISSED.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.375
OH, DAMN.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.310
OH, YOU KISSED JEREMY?
PETER, I AM SO SORRY.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.345
IT'S JUST JEREMY
AND I HAVE BEEN

15:12.379 --> 15:14.381
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME
TOGETHER...
[chime]

15:14.414 --> 15:15.983
TAMRA, ARE YOU
RECORDING THIS?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.717
SORRY, IT'S JUST
HELLA DRAMATIC, THOUGH.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.486
(Lauren)
PLEASE STOP.
PETER!

15:19.519 --> 15:22.389
A GOOD SMILE CAN BUILD
CONFIDENCE AND SELF-ESTEEM.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.993
I MYSELF HAVE BENEFITED
FROM A PERFECT SMILE AND TEETH.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.161
[crowd gasps]

15:30.030 --> 15:32.232
ARE THOSE TEETH
UP FOR GRABS?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.570
[playing Let It Go on piano]

15:37.604 --> 15:40.140

15:40.173 --> 15:43.110
[pounding at door]

15:43.143 --> 15:44.611
YEAH?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.280
(Morgan)
OPEN THE DOOR.
I HEAR YOU PLAYING FROZEN.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.281
[pounding on door]

15:48.315 --> 15:49.649
I HEAR YOU, I HEAR YOU.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.219
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
DON'T BE MAD.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.187
COUSIN LOU
TOOK YOUR WALLET.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.755
WHAT?
GIVE ME THAT.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.324
SORRY.
I'M A THIEF.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.259
HE'S A THIEF.
OKAY, UH, LOU?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.394
WHEN I FIRST STARTED
WORKING FOR YOU DORKS,

16:01.428 --> 16:04.731
I HAD ONE MISSION--TO LOCK DOWN
THAT RICH INDIAN SPINSTER

16:04.764 --> 16:07.434
SO I'D NEVER HAVE TO FIX ANOTHER
PRINTER AGAIN IN MY LIFE.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.601
I THOUGHT,
PIECE OF CAKE, LOU.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.770
NO OFFENSE, BUT I'M TALLER,
I'M JACKED,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.339
I GOT CALVES
THAT COULD CRACK WALNUTS.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.673
BUT EVERY TIME
I START FLIRTING WITH HER,

16:13.706 --> 16:16.676
SHE'D GO ON AND ON ABOUT
HOW GOT SUCH A GREAT MOUTH.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.245
YOU CAN'T KEEP SECRETS,
DIAMOND.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.747
YOU GOT TO BE OPEN
WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.284
I, TOO, HAVE BEEN
HARBORING A SECRET.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.518
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.020
YOU'RE ALREADY
TELLING US A STORY.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.221
DIAMOND,
LET THE MAN SPEAK.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.391
MANY YEARS AGO, MY COUSIN
MORGAN AND I WERE STEALING CARS,

16:31.424 --> 16:33.193
AND THE COPS CAME.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.096
I GOT CAUGHT,
BUT MORGAN, HE WENT FREE.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.464
IT WAS EATING ME UP INSIDE,

16:37.497 --> 16:40.333
THAT I WAS SITTING
IN THAT JAIL CELL ROTTING

16:40.367 --> 16:41.634
WHILE MORGAN WAS OUT THERE
FREE AS A BIRD.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.104
SO I RATTED ON HIM,
AND HE CAME TO JAIL WITH ME.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.772
WAIT, WHAT?

16:45.805 --> 16:48.375
NOW, AREN'T YOU HAPPIER THAT
I FINALLY TOLD YOU THE TRUTH?

16:48.408 --> 16:49.542
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

16:49.576 --> 16:51.344
IF I HADN'T RATTED YOU OUT,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.713
WE WOULD HAVE NEVER SPENT
TWO YEARS SHARING A BUNKIE.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.283
AND NOW, WE'RE CLOSER
THAN COUSINS.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.718
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.753
HE'S RIGHT.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.355
[laughs]
HE'S RIGHT.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.490
YEAH?
YEAH.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.491
SEE, DIAMOND?

17:04.524 --> 17:06.626
THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.528
[playing random notes]

17:08.561 --> 17:10.430
I DO NOT KNOW
HOW TO PLAY A PIANO.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.432
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.067
I THINK YOU GUYS
SHOULD HEAD OUT.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.635
TAKE THIS OFF HERE.
YEAH.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.704
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS HIT THE ROAD?
WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER TIME.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.671
THAT WAS GREAT.
YES. YES, YES.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.109
HEY, REMEMBER,
THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.288
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
KISSING LAUREN ANYWAY?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.124
I THOUGHT YOU--
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GAY.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.825
I'M NOT GAY.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

17:38.858 --> 17:39.826
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT GAY?

17:39.859 --> 17:40.827
WHO'S THAT OLD GUY
YOU WERE DATING

17:40.860 --> 17:41.828
THAT TOOK US
OUT TO DINNER?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.263
THAT WAS MY FATHER.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.797
THAT WAS YOUR DAD?

17:44.831 --> 17:47.434
YOU GUYS HAVE
A VERY UNREADABLE CHEMISTRY.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.836
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT I DID WAS HORRIBLE.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.340
AND, YEAH, YOU'VE GOT
EVERY RIGHT TO BE MAD AT ME.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.575
BUT I WANT TO SEE
WHERE THINGS GO WITH LAUREN.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.609
WHAT?

17:56.643 --> 17:58.611
I LIKE HER, PETER.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.480
AND, YEAH, IF WE DATE,

18:00.513 --> 18:01.681
THEN PEOPLE WILL
RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.516
BUT LOOK AT
WOODY AND SOON-YI.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.651
EVERYBODY HATED
THEM AT FIRST,

18:04.684 --> 18:06.353
AND NOW THEY'RE
AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.288
SO YOU THINK YOU CAN
JUST STEAL MY GIRLFRIEND?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.290
YOU THINK THAT SHE WOULD CHOOSE
SOME FRESH-OFF-THE-BOAT RANDO

18:10.323 --> 18:11.758
INSTEAD OF ME?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.360
WELL, WE'LL SEE,
WON'T WE?

18:13.393 --> 18:14.861
I WILL KNOCK
ANOTHER TOOTH OUT.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.563
YOU JUST HIT ME
WITH YOUR PEAS.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.703
CAREFUL,
THIS TIARA COST $8,000!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.805
[groaning]

18:25.838 --> 18:27.907
CAN YOU STOP FILMING ME,
PLEASE?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.609
WHAT,
I CAN'T FILM MY LIFE?

18:29.642 --> 18:32.345
SOME WHITE SLOB EATS FAST FOOD
EVERY DAY AND WINS A OSCAR?

18:32.379 --> 18:34.247
COME ON,
ONE OF Y'ALL THROW A PUNCH.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.183
MY PHONE BATTERY'S
ABOUT TO DIE.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.484
WE'LL SEE.
YEAH, WE WILL SEE.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.553
I LIVE IN THAT DIRECTION.
I LIVE THIS WAY.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.357
(Danny)
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.658
YOUR DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.260
WHAT IF I'D BEEN
A MURDERER?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.661
WELL, IF YOU'D
BEEN A MURDERER,

18:48.695 --> 18:51.264
I WOULD HAVE STABBED YOU
WITH MY KNIFE.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.700
OH, GOD.
OH, I'M SO--I'M SO SORRY!

18:53.733 --> 18:54.867
GREAT, DANNY.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.369
I PROBABLY
JUST KILLED SOMEONE,

18:56.403 --> 18:57.504
AND I LOST MY BEST KNIFE.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.539
OKAY, MOVE OVER, ZORRO.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.740
ZORRO?
YEAH.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.409
I'M TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND
THAT REFERENCE.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.852
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE
GONNA BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

19:12.885 --> 19:14.387
IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME.
I DO TRUST YOU.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.588
IF YOU'D JUST SHUT UP
FOR A SECOND,

19:15.622 --> 19:16.856
I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.491
AND YOU SHOULDN'T TELL
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, "SHUT UP."

19:18.525 --> 19:19.492
IT'S NOT NICE.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.263
OKAY.
SO I MADE A LIST.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.566
I WAS ONCE A STRIPPER
NAMED "DIAMOND DAN,"

19:26.599 --> 19:30.437
AND I DID IT
TO PAY FOR MED SCHOOL.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.872
AND THE SAVINGS
HELP ME PAY OFF

19:32.905 --> 19:35.908
MY MOTHER'S MORTGAGE
ON HER HOUSE.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.314
I ALWAYS TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T HAVE A MIDDLE NAME.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.683
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S ALAN.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.452
IT'S ACTUALLY
MY DAD'S NAME.

19:45.485 --> 19:48.421
I JUST--I JUST
HATED HIM SO MUCH

19:48.455 --> 19:50.357
I WANTED TO PRETEND
IT DIDN'T EXIST.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.525
CAN I--CAN I TELL YOU ONE?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.826
SURE.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.263
I THINK THE REASON THAT
I TELL EVERYONE ABOUT US

19:56.296 --> 19:58.931
IS BECAUSE...

19:58.965 --> 20:01.368
I WANT IT TO BE REAL.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.536
AND THE MORE REAL IT SEEMS,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.438
THE LESS LIKELY IT IS

20:05.472 --> 20:08.241
THAT IT COULD ALL
GET TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.581
IT'S REAL.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.552
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.355
OKAY, WHEN I WAS IN
THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE,

20:22.389 --> 20:24.257
MY MOTHER COULDN'T
AFFORD A BACKPACK,

20:24.291 --> 20:27.960
SO I...I CARRIED
A PURSE TO SCHOOL.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.899
LET'S GO INSIDE.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.302
OKAY.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.303
[police sirens]

20:36.336 --> 20:38.605
OH, MY GOD.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.839
(Danny)
DON'T GO TO BED YET.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.140
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

20:41.173 --> 20:44.444
(Mindy)
I'M SLEEPY. I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK AT YOUR COIN COLLECTION.
