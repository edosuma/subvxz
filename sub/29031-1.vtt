03:23.643 --> 03:25.208
Shit! Oh!

03:25.210 --> 03:26.292
Oh I didn't know whether to knock or...

03:26.294 --> 03:27.125
[Male] Shh.

03:27.127 --> 03:27.959
Sorry, sorry.

03:27.961 --> 03:29.270
What's happened?

03:29.272 --> 03:30.294
Is Esme in?

03:30.296 --> 03:31.727
No, yeah, she's asleep.

03:31.729 --> 03:32.560
What's happening?

03:32.562 --> 03:34.245
Oh, we had a fire.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.590
Jesus, are you on your own?

03:35.592 --> 03:36.907
No, I'm with Parnell.

03:36.909 --> 03:39.447
Okay, where is he, is everyone alright?

03:39.449 --> 03:42.132
Yeah, do you think
we should wake Esme up?

03:42.134 --> 03:43.250
I thought it was gonna be warm.

03:43.252 --> 03:44.649
It gets warm later in the day.

03:44.651 --> 03:45.483
Should I go get him?

03:45.485 --> 03:47.308
No, that's alright, I'll get him.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.815
It's fine.

03:48.817 --> 03:49.648
Oh, you sure?

03:49.650 --> 03:50.853
Yeah, it's easier.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.298
Alright.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.618
It's parked out by the gate.

03:53.620 --> 03:54.568
Do you want me to move it?

03:54.570 --> 03:56.648
No, we can do that later.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.526
I'll go get Parnell,
you just chill out here.

03:58.528 --> 03:59.726
Alright.

03:59.728 --> 04:02.228
Have a cup of tea or coffee.

04:03.394 --> 04:05.149
Actually, the kettle's pretty loud.

04:05.151 --> 04:07.151
Oh, I'll grab a water.

Parnell.

05:19.365 --> 05:20.355
What's up?

05:20.357 --> 05:21.190
Nothing.

05:22.086 --> 05:23.592
You look a bit lost mate.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.017
Your mom's wondering where you are.

05:26.019 --> 05:27.569
She left me in the car.

05:29.158 --> 05:30.490
What happened with this fire then?

05:30.492 --> 05:31.492
What fire?

05:34.730 --> 05:35.694
Where were you?

05:35.696 --> 05:38.368
Shh, your sister's asleep.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.043
You left me in the car.

05:40.045 --> 05:43.712
You didn't look like
you wanted waking up.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.852
[Woman] Alfie!

05:57.497 --> 05:58.330
Ah.

06:12.451 --> 06:13.281
Alfie, what's going on?

06:13.283 --> 06:14.272
Who's downstairs?

06:15.180 --> 06:16.293
It's your mom.

06:17.449 --> 06:18.706
Fuck off.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.132
What?

06:20.134 --> 06:21.248
You're joking.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.733
No, she's downstairs.

06:24.028 --> 06:25.488
What are you on about?

06:25.490 --> 06:26.397
Why?

06:26.399 --> 06:27.305
What the fuck?

06:27.307 --> 06:28.928
Your brother's here too.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.760
Who, Parnell?

06:29.762 --> 06:30.596
[Alfie] Yeah.

06:31.589 --> 06:32.640
Marty's not here?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.502
No, just your mom and Parnell.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.387
Wait, wait, wait, I don't get it.

06:38.389 --> 06:39.671
Why, why are they here?

06:39.673 --> 06:42.399
[Alfie] There was a fire apparently.

06:42.401 --> 06:43.231
What?

06:43.233 --> 06:44.718
Are you serious?

06:44.720 --> 06:46.798
Wait, that doesn't even make any sense.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.728
Why would they come all this way?

06:48.730 --> 06:49.580
Calm down Esme.

06:51.901 --> 06:52.993
Shh.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.829
[heavy breathing]

07:07.470 --> 07:08.789
Should I leave you to it?

07:08.791 --> 07:10.199
[Esme] No, no.

07:10.201 --> 07:11.451
Don't leave me.

07:14.202 --> 07:15.036
Okay.

07:31.529 --> 07:33.352
[Esme] Hi, how are you both?

07:34.439 --> 07:35.273
Good.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.707
Is everything okay?

07:39.709 --> 07:40.543
We had a fire.

07:41.470 --> 07:43.058
Yeah, Alfie said.

07:43.060 --> 07:45.408
I'm not sure I quite understand.

07:45.410 --> 07:46.368
Understand what?

07:46.370 --> 07:47.567
Well it's such a long way to come.

07:47.569 --> 07:49.348
Maybe you should have rang first?

07:49.350 --> 07:51.302
Oh both batteries are dead.

07:53.259 --> 07:55.127
Have you offered everyone a drink Alfie?

07:55.129 --> 07:55.961
Are you both alright for a drink?

07:55.963 --> 07:57.879
[Maggie] Yeah, no, no,
we're both good Esme.

07:59.629 --> 08:01.687
[Esme] So how did you get here?

08:01.689 --> 08:04.151
[Maggie] Oh we drove down in the car.

08:04.153 --> 08:05.928
[Esme] I didn't know you had a car.

08:05.930 --> 08:08.404
[Maggie] No, Janet lent us hers.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.798
And there wasn't an option
to stay at Janet's no?

08:10.800 --> 08:11.630
Es.

08:11.632 --> 08:12.577
Well I didn't want to bother her.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.748
So Janet let you take the car,

08:14.750 --> 08:16.337
drive across the channel
in the middle of the night,

08:16.339 --> 08:17.627
but you couldn't stop on her sofa?

08:17.629 --> 08:19.627
She's only got that small flat.

08:19.629 --> 08:20.777
How bad was it?

08:20.779 --> 08:21.610
How bad was what?

08:21.612 --> 08:22.478
The fire.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.310
How bad was it?

08:23.312 --> 08:25.218
Was it contained or did
neighbors have to be moved away.

08:25.220 --> 08:26.988
No, no, it wasn't a big fire,

08:26.990 --> 08:29.663
but it was water damage.

08:30.899 --> 08:32.302
The water damage.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.578
Well I see you managed to
pack before it all kicked off.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.498
Oh Jesus.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.690
Why are you here?

08:37.692 --> 08:39.188
I don't know!

08:39.191 --> 08:40.145
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

08:40.147 --> 08:42.006
And the fuck would you think it was?

08:42.009 --> 08:43.460
Do you know what!

08:47.500 --> 08:48.763
What, I tried.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.988
Don't worry, she wouldn't
have gone anywhere.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.243
She just likes the drama.

09:04.470 --> 09:07.098
So, what's going on?

09:07.100 --> 09:07.932
Nothing.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.413
Nothing, nothing's going on?

09:13.027 --> 09:14.277
I don't know.

09:16.990 --> 09:17.822
Okay.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.602
How are you?

09:24.490 --> 09:25.866
Can I have a hug?

09:34.609 --> 09:39.609
[ominous music]
[water rushing]

[doorbell buzzing]

09:53.004 --> 09:53.836
Yep.

09:54.711 --> 09:55.544
Come up.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.060
Don't let him in, please.

09:58.062 --> 09:59.287
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

09:59.289 --> 10:01.232
Listen, nothing's gonna happen to ya.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.147
You got nothing to worry about.

10:04.149 --> 10:05.501
No you don't understand,
they're gonna kill me.

10:05.503 --> 10:06.336
Hey, hey.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.720
Don't you be daft son.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.060
No one's gonna do anything
like that, you hear me?

10:14.062 --> 10:16.068
I didn't even do anything wrong.

10:16.070 --> 10:16.903
Exactly.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.238
Alright, you haven't done anything.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.690
You've done everything right.

10:22.559 --> 10:23.425
We've not gone to the police,

10:23.427 --> 10:26.208
Malk's the first person we've called.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.533
There's nothing to worry about, alright?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.100
And you won't let him hurt me?

10:33.480 --> 10:34.879
No one's going to hurt ya.

10:47.389 --> 10:48.438
Is that John?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.185
He's with me Kev, don't worry.

10:50.187 --> 10:52.056
I told you not to bring him here though.

10:52.058 --> 10:53.537
He's alright, he's waiting outside.

10:53.539 --> 10:55.623
You're the first person he talked to.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.457
You know him.

10:58.403 --> 10:59.557
No one's interrogating anyone,

10:59.559 --> 11:01.627
everyone just wants to know what happened.

11:01.629 --> 11:03.188
I don't like him being
right outside the door,

11:03.190 --> 11:04.342
it makes me nervous.

11:04.344 --> 11:06.078
Kev, I'm here, nothings gonna kick off.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.667
And the lads done nothing wrong, alright.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.208
[Kev] Just go easy
alright, he's a good lad.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.297
[Malk] Yeah, alright.

11:12.299 --> 11:13.887
It's been a shitty night for him too.

11:13.889 --> 11:15.702
Just go easy.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.637
Yeah.

11:18.639 --> 11:21.383
Alright, no one's in trouble.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.359
We're all just talking alright?

11:26.758 --> 11:27.958
Just tell the truth son.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.200
Who put this together, mom?

11:48.940 --> 11:50.618
How did this happen?

11:50.620 --> 11:53.098
I'm too tired to lie to you so,

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
can we just drop it?

12:02.250 --> 12:04.499
There you go.

12:06.302 --> 12:07.962
Hey, I've missed you you know.

12:08.802 --> 12:10.003
You must be tired too.

12:15.070 --> 12:17.157
[Esme] Alfie's gonna
set you up with one of the

12:17.159 --> 12:19.829
guest rooms so you can
get some sleep okay?

12:19.831 --> 12:21.230
You sending me to bed now?

12:22.250 --> 12:23.212
Jesus mom, what?

12:24.384 --> 12:25.310
I'm sorry we're bothering you.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.477
I thought we'd be welcome.

12:27.479 --> 12:30.007
You are welcome mom, but you call first,

12:30.009 --> 12:34.185
you ask to stay or you get
invited, like normal people.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.387
I guess we're not normal are we?

12:35.389 --> 12:37.667
Okay, I'm gonna go to work.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.501
Get some sleep.

12:38.503 --> 12:39.917
Alfie's gonna give you
whatever you need, ya?

12:39.919 --> 12:40.752
Thanks.

12:45.072 --> 12:47.600
What?

12:47.602 --> 12:49.287
Where's Marty?

12:49.289 --> 12:50.318
I don't know Esme.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.541
He's not planning on
showing up too is he?

12:52.543 --> 12:53.710
[Maggie] No.

12:55.215 --> 13:00.215
[door banging]
[ominous music]

13:01.100 --> 13:02.432
[Malk] Boycie.

13:05.753 --> 13:06.586
Boycie.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.117
Don't tell them I'm here.

13:12.119 --> 13:13.869
As if I would, shh.

13:15.114 --> 13:16.065
[Malk] Boycie!

13:16.067 --> 13:16.922
Two seconds mate.

13:16.924 --> 13:18.257
Boycie, what's going on?

13:18.259 --> 13:19.460
What, is this for him?

13:19.462 --> 13:20.440
Out the back.

13:20.442 --> 13:21.273
Out the back.

13:21.275 --> 13:24.358
I'm not having this shit in my house!

13:27.370 --> 13:29.451
[Boycie] What's up mate?

13:29.453 --> 13:30.285
It's locked.

13:30.287 --> 13:31.797
Oh Jesus.

13:31.799 --> 13:33.249
I don't think that's a good idea mate.

13:33.251 --> 13:34.083
[Malk] Why?

13:34.085 --> 13:35.140
Why I've got the kids upstairs.

13:35.142 --> 13:36.243
[Malk] Well come outside then.

13:36.245 --> 13:38.501
Don't leave me out here
like a fucking cunt.

13:38.503 --> 13:41.170
[door clanking]

13:47.215 --> 13:48.931
Shit!
[John knocking]

13:48.933 --> 13:50.935
For fuck's sake.

13:50.937 --> 13:53.828
Wait, no, no, no don't do that!

13:53.830 --> 13:54.663
Ryan!

13:56.179 --> 13:58.338
Open the fucking door!

13:58.340 --> 13:59.350
Alright, alright, alright!

13:59.352 --> 14:00.588
Hey, hey, hey!

14:00.590 --> 14:02.127
There's no need for this.

14:02.129 --> 14:02.959
No need for what?

14:02.961 --> 14:03.877
Why wouldn't you open the door for him?

14:03.879 --> 14:05.112
He's not even here.

14:06.110 --> 14:06.940
Who's not here?

14:06.942 --> 14:07.773
This is out of order,

14:07.775 --> 14:08.613
you don't just barge into our house.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.906
It's alright Debs, we'll
be out of here in a second.

14:09.908 --> 14:11.600
If he's not here, then why won't you

14:11.602 --> 14:12.958
open the fucking door for him?

14:12.960 --> 14:15.509
'Cause I don't want you
in my fucking house mate.

14:16.379 --> 14:17.210
So where is he then?

14:17.212 --> 14:18.919
I told you, he's not here!

14:18.921 --> 14:20.671
He's not here Malk!

14:21.905 --> 14:23.339
Let's have a look upstairs, eh?

14:23.341 --> 14:24.276
Oi, no don't do that!

14:24.278 --> 14:25.166
The kids are in bed!

14:25.168 --> 14:25.998
[Boycie] Leave it alone!

14:26.000 --> 14:26.831
[Debs] John!

14:26.833 --> 14:28.359
Savs, for fucks sakes, he's not here!

14:29.389 --> 14:30.248
Leave it alone!

14:30.250 --> 14:31.915
Malk mate, what the fuck?

14:31.917 --> 14:33.065
What the fucks it gotta do with me mate?

14:33.067 --> 14:34.832
You're in my fucking house!

14:35.770 --> 14:36.912
[Little Girl] Mommy!

14:36.914 --> 14:37.746
[Debs] It's alright.

14:37.748 --> 14:39.170
Stay there, stay there!

14:39.172 --> 14:40.579
It's alright kids.

14:40.581 --> 14:42.537
[Debs] For fucks sake,
you're out of order.

14:42.539 --> 14:43.633
Savs man, there's no need for this.

14:43.635 --> 14:44.467
He's not even here.

14:44.469 --> 14:45.300
[Savs] So where is he?

14:45.302 --> 14:46.291
I told you, I swear, I haven't seen him.

14:46.293 --> 14:48.127
[Debs] Can you just leave now Malk?

14:48.129 --> 14:50.022
John, he's my mate yeah?

14:50.024 --> 14:50.854
[John] Yeah, yeah.

14:50.856 --> 14:51.688
No!

14:51.690 --> 14:52.978
Don't, he hasn't done anything!

14:52.980 --> 14:54.828
He's gone, he was here but he left!

14:54.830 --> 14:55.700
Oh, so he was here aye?

14:55.702 --> 14:56.618
Half an hour ago!

14:56.620 --> 14:57.498
Stop it!

14:57.500 --> 14:58.560
Where's he gone then Debs?

14:58.562 --> 14:59.393
I don't know!

14:59.395 --> 15:00.227
Please!

15:00.229 --> 15:01.493
I swear to fucking god.

15:01.495 --> 15:02.915
I will burn this place
down with your kids in it.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.575
For fucks sake, he
went over the back fence!

15:05.577 --> 15:06.408
[John] When?

15:06.410 --> 15:08.078
Literally a fucking minute ago!

15:08.080 --> 15:09.108
John.

15:09.110 --> 15:09.988
John!

15:09.990 --> 15:11.903
Get the fuck out of my house now!

15:12.879 --> 15:14.029
Alright, fair enough.

15:16.986 --> 15:18.057
And you can fuck off too!

15:18.059 --> 15:20.287
I'm not having this shit around my kids!

15:20.289 --> 15:22.169
You and your fucking friends!

15:24.403 --> 15:25.234
What?

15:25.236 --> 15:26.068
[Debs] It's alright kids.

15:26.070 --> 15:28.737
[ominous music]

15:48.029 --> 15:51.507
She's a fucking cunt dude, come on.

15:51.509 --> 15:52.342
[Malk] John.

15:56.370 --> 15:57.463
John are you listening?

15:57.465 --> 15:58.296
[John] What?

15:58.298 --> 16:00.177
[Malk] That wasn't too bright mate.

16:00.179 --> 16:01.148
What?

16:01.150 --> 16:02.588
Well you can't just
be breaking into peoples

16:02.590 --> 16:04.700
houses threatening their kids.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.054
I wasn't threatening their kids.

16:07.056 --> 16:07.889
Fuck.

16:08.807 --> 16:10.938
[Malk] I just don't wanna upset anyone

16:10.940 --> 16:13.052
that don't need upsetting, that's all.

16:13.054 --> 16:14.598
Aye, you know what mate?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.358
We can go back and settle
'em down if you want.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.493
No, we don't need to do that.

16:18.495 --> 16:19.980
Boycie's sound mate.

16:19.982 --> 16:22.787
It's just, we don't want anyone turning.

16:22.789 --> 16:24.338
We're just knocking on doors mate.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.171
Yeah, but you know what
happens if we get caught

16:25.173 --> 16:27.532
knocking on doors right?

16:27.534 --> 16:28.640
You know what happens if I get seen

16:28.642 --> 16:30.028
in a car with you?

16:30.030 --> 16:31.614
You know what mate,

16:31.616 --> 16:35.366
I don't really wanna
talk about it right now.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.373
We need to find these fucking cunts!

16:43.100 --> 16:44.167
[Parnell] It's a cupboard.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.692
Yeah, it's your cupboard.

16:47.350 --> 16:49.478
I'll get Bill to bring some towels,

16:49.480 --> 16:51.537
and bedding, and stuff later on.

16:51.539 --> 16:52.748
Thanks.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.218
[Alfie] I'll show you your room Maggie.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.052
Yeah, thanks.

17:03.579 --> 17:04.679
[Alfie] Here we are.

17:07.410 --> 17:08.948
[Maggie] Fucking hell, it's beautiful.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.807
Oh sorry, pardon my French.

17:10.809 --> 17:12.159
It's alright, I'm fluent.

17:13.108 --> 17:14.377
[Maggie] Is it far into town?

17:14.380 --> 17:16.883
No, it's like a 10 minute
walk, something like that.

17:17.868 --> 17:19.738
There's plenty of stuff in the fridge.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.948
Food and whatever, whatever you need.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.248
Oh thanks.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.288
I've got some work to do,

17:24.290 --> 17:26.440
so I'm gonna get on with it.

17:26.442 --> 17:27.272
Alright.

17:27.275 --> 17:28.105
Cool, in a bit.

17:28.107 --> 17:28.939
See ya later.

17:28.941 --> 17:30.107
[Alfie] Bye.

17:38.073 --> 17:40.823
[light rumbling]

17:44.476 --> 17:47.309
[leaves rustling]

18:03.818 --> 18:05.748
[Parnell] When can I have my phone back?

18:05.750 --> 18:07.428
I told ya, you can't
have your phone back.

18:07.430 --> 18:08.718
Why?

18:08.720 --> 18:11.648
Because I don't want you calling anyone.

18:11.650 --> 18:12.638
Really though!

18:12.640 --> 18:13.767
I need to tell you why.

18:13.769 --> 18:14.928
[Parnell] No.

18:14.930 --> 18:15.763
Okay.

18:26.319 --> 18:27.699
[Parnell] We need to
talk about Marty though.

18:27.701 --> 18:29.538
Fuck Marty.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.867
Fuck him, he's on his own now.

18:30.869 --> 18:31.998
Why would you say that?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.408
Why would I say what?

18:33.410 --> 18:34.938
Look at the position he's put us in.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.083
You don't know what
you're talking about.

18:36.085 --> 18:36.918
Don't I?

18:39.950 --> 18:41.250
Why'd you bring us here?

18:42.950 --> 18:44.719
We're safe here.

18:44.721 --> 18:46.554
[Parnell] You think?

18:49.073 --> 18:51.823
[birds chirping]

19:00.433 --> 19:02.933
[dog barking]

19:18.838 --> 19:21.588
[light rumbling]

19:23.593 --> 19:27.037
[door slamming]

19:27.039 --> 19:29.117
Quick, hide the joint, hide the joint.

19:29.119 --> 19:30.638
It's the feds!

19:30.640 --> 19:31.840
Got your bedding sorted.

19:52.262 --> 19:55.429
[children chattering]

19:58.914 --> 20:01.498
[bell ringing]

20:16.771 --> 20:19.438
[ominous music]

20:26.373 --> 20:27.738
[Woman] Esme.

20:27.740 --> 20:28.677
Sorry.

20:28.679 --> 20:29.509
That's okay.

20:29.511 --> 20:30.343
I'm just popping out.

20:30.345 --> 20:31.448
You okay to look after the customer?

20:31.450 --> 20:34.116
Yeah, yeah, that's fine, yeah.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.105
[chillout music]

20:43.107 --> 20:46.421
[Alfie] 40 perches and an acre.

20:46.423 --> 20:47.708
Oh really?

20:47.710 --> 20:48.540
Yeah, it's quite big

20:48.542 --> 20:50.867
and hopefully it'll get
bigger the year after.

20:50.869 --> 20:52.498
I mean the idea is to get less tourists

20:52.500 --> 20:54.577
and more, like real people.

20:54.579 --> 20:56.107
Are tourists not real people though?

20:56.109 --> 20:56.940
Well yeah,

20:56.942 --> 20:59.027
but we want the place to be more

20:59.029 --> 21:01.297
of a permanent residence, self-sufficient.

21:01.299 --> 21:02.782
Why don't you have a beer?

21:06.400 --> 21:07.750
Just the one though.

21:07.752 --> 21:09.836
[Parnell] Yeah alright.

21:20.210 --> 21:22.087
Hey, how's everyone?

21:22.089 --> 21:23.089
[Maggie] Oh hello.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.498
I'm Maggie.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.827
Bill.

21:26.829 --> 21:27.837
Alfie's dad.

21:27.839 --> 21:28.807
On occasion.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.974
[Maggie chuckles]

21:30.976 --> 21:31.938
I thought you might want something

21:31.940 --> 21:33.708
to keep you occupied while you're staying.

21:33.710 --> 21:34.543
Oh, thank you.

21:35.509 --> 21:36.341
That's nice.

21:36.343 --> 21:37.893
This is Esme's mom.

21:38.848 --> 21:39.680
Our guest.

21:39.682 --> 21:40.863
[Alfie] And her brother Parnell.

21:41.769 --> 21:43.959
[Bill] I'm Bill, nice to meet you.

21:43.961 --> 21:45.218
You reckon that thing still works?

21:45.220 --> 21:46.577
Well if you're lucky, Alfie will have

21:46.579 --> 21:48.579
some decent games buried away somewhere.

21:51.701 --> 21:52.680
Where ya going?

21:52.682 --> 21:53.514
[Parnell] Outside.

21:53.516 --> 21:55.516
[Maggie] Don't go far.

22:05.212 --> 22:07.807
Mm, tastes a bit like hamster food.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.158
It does taste a bit like hamster food.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.557
Well, depending on how long you stay,

22:14.559 --> 22:16.509
I'll make you something nice one night.

22:18.390 --> 22:19.293
What, a proper meal?

22:20.839 --> 22:25.839
[light rumbling]
[crickets chirping]

22:35.849 --> 22:36.682
Chilly aye?

22:38.019 --> 22:39.093
Fucking freezing.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.610
Do you need an extra layer?

22:43.039 --> 22:44.698
I'm alright, thanks.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.317
Stick with the roadman look aye?

22:47.319 --> 22:49.178
Look mate, don't strain yourself.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.830
Wherever you're heading, head on.

22:51.730 --> 22:52.992
Got no friends have you?

22:54.897 --> 22:56.142
Brought them all with you?

22:58.029 --> 23:00.797
Doubt you brought anymore
of that other stuff either.

23:00.799 --> 23:03.797
If you need anymore, swing by my place.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.507
And don't worry, I won't tell your mom.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.978
My mom's not the one I'm worried about,

23:06.980 --> 23:08.507
it's my sister.

23:08.509 --> 23:10.292
She is the strict one alright.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.267
I was just leaving.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.772
Don't let me get in your way.

23:25.359 --> 23:26.622
Settling in then?

23:27.559 --> 23:28.680
[Maggie] Have a beer.

23:28.682 --> 23:29.823
[Esme] I don't drink.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.825
Sorry, force of habit.

23:32.721 --> 23:33.552
You alright?

23:33.554 --> 23:35.178
Mm hm.

23:35.180 --> 23:39.678
Is everyone okay?

23:39.680 --> 23:40.513
Alfie.

23:42.049 --> 23:44.966
[faint rock music]

23:54.019 --> 23:55.337
You alright?

23:55.339 --> 23:56.267
Yeah.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.468
Now that the whole gang's back together,

23:57.470 --> 23:59.242
all we're missing is Monopoly.

24:06.089 --> 24:08.232
Should we see if we can
get this thing set up?

24:13.480 --> 24:14.313
Yeah, can do.

24:18.325 --> 24:20.044
I guess I'm staying here then.

24:20.046 --> 24:21.748
Let's go upstairs.

24:21.750 --> 24:22.581
Can I bring my drink?

24:22.583 --> 24:24.393
You don't need my permission mom.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.353
[TV hissing]

24:45.355 --> 24:46.605
Stupid thing.

24:47.636 --> 24:50.194
You haven't any gotten
any photos around here.

24:50.196 --> 24:53.898
I'm gonna have to get you some of us.

24:53.900 --> 24:55.027
[Esme] Yeah, Alfie loves the photo.

24:55.029 --> 24:56.379
I've never really bothered.

24:57.648 --> 24:58.780
How come?

24:58.782 --> 25:00.547
[Esme] I don't know.

25:00.549 --> 25:02.597
You never had any photos around the house.

25:02.599 --> 25:03.432
Didn't I?

25:04.940 --> 25:08.323
[Esme] Okay, so there's
no judgment in this space.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.509
Okay.

25:11.779 --> 25:15.658
This place is a place of honesty.

25:15.660 --> 25:18.097
Yeah, so let's not talk
about this whole fire

25:18.099 --> 25:19.617
because it's hurtful to me when I know

25:19.619 --> 25:21.017
you're lying and I think we should avoid

25:21.019 --> 25:22.948
- being hurtful to one another.
- Who says I'm lying?

25:22.950 --> 25:23.780
[Esme] Mom!

25:23.782 --> 25:24.789
You don't know I'm lying.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.083
Okay.

25:30.054 --> 25:31.587
Let's just forget about that.

25:31.589 --> 25:34.158
I'm really trying to make
this non-confrontational.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.777
But you are being confrontational.

25:35.779 --> 25:36.878
You just called me a liar.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.120
But you did lie!

25:38.122 --> 25:40.574
Maybe, but you don't now I lied, do ya?

25:40.576 --> 25:41.748
You said you know I lied, you didn't.

25:41.750 --> 25:42.921
You're guessing.

25:42.923 --> 25:44.343
And that means you're judging me.

25:50.099 --> 25:51.732
Okay.

25:51.734 --> 25:53.817
Well let's just start again.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.517
Fine, just don't call me a liar.

25:56.519 --> 25:58.062
Fine, I won't.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.113
Don't lie.

26:01.652 --> 26:02.485
[video game sounds]

26:09.289 --> 26:12.757
Parnell went out with Marty last night.

26:12.759 --> 26:14.796
They got into a fight.

26:14.798 --> 26:16.257
All I know is that Marty's give this kid

26:16.259 --> 26:17.938
a really good hiding.

26:17.940 --> 26:20.311
And now his brothers after him.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.870
Well it sounds like he wants to

26:23.349 --> 26:24.956
give Parnell a digging on.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.658
[Esme] Okay.

26:27.660 --> 26:28.577
Well I didn't want Parnell getting a

26:28.579 --> 26:29.888
beating 'cause of what Marty had done,

26:29.890 --> 26:30.908
so I thought the best thing to do

26:30.910 --> 26:32.710
was just to get him away from there.

26:35.690 --> 26:36.607
And how long do you think

26:36.609 --> 26:38.307
before this all gets sorted out?

26:38.309 --> 26:41.017
You mean how long do
you think we'd be staying?

26:41.019 --> 26:43.337
I don't think that's
an unreasonable question.

26:43.339 --> 26:44.173
I don't know.

26:45.099 --> 26:46.138
I'll find somewhere for us.

26:46.140 --> 26:48.133
I just need tonight, maybe tomorrow.

26:50.575 --> 26:51.408
What?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.109
Nothing.

26:54.111 --> 26:55.888
Well if you're gonna
say something, go on.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.797
I just don't understand why you're

26:57.799 --> 27:00.567
letting Parnell hang out with
Marty in the first place.

27:00.569 --> 27:01.969
Parnell's 16, he can hang out with

27:01.971 --> 27:02.802
whoever he wants.

27:02.804 --> 27:03.757
And Marty is his brother.

27:03.759 --> 27:06.057
Yeah, but Marty's bad news mom.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.179
Marty and all his little mates.

27:08.181 --> 27:09.757
What do you mean Marty
and all his little mates?

27:09.759 --> 27:11.287
You don't know anything about Marty.

27:11.289 --> 27:13.186
I don't know anything about Marty?

27:13.188 --> 27:14.030
He's your brother and all.

27:14.032 --> 27:14.908
I don't care!

27:14.910 --> 27:17.208
He's nasty and he always been!

27:17.210 --> 27:18.458
He's my son!

27:18.460 --> 27:19.423
Oh isn't he just.

27:24.125 --> 27:25.375
Can I go now?

27:29.390 --> 27:31.138
I really don't know
what I ever did to you.

27:31.140 --> 27:33.047
No you really don't.

27:39.378 --> 27:40.211
[video game sounds]

27:44.886 --> 27:47.803
[slow paced music]

27:56.900 --> 27:58.371
Oi.

27:58.373 --> 27:59.203
What?

27:59.205 --> 28:00.401
Can you not do that?

28:00.403 --> 28:01.235
Do what?

28:01.237 --> 28:02.420
I'm brushing my teeth.

28:03.450 --> 28:04.283
Yeah.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.497
I don't want to be one of those couples

28:07.499 --> 28:10.326
that brush their teeth together.

28:10.328 --> 28:13.162
[Alfie chuckling]

28:20.109 --> 28:21.878
They can't stay here.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.130
Es they're your family.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.297
I don't care.

28:25.299 --> 28:27.367
The last thing we want is
them getting comfortable

28:27.369 --> 28:30.133
or thinking they can
stay here indefinitely.

28:30.135 --> 28:31.418
Do you think there's more to the story

28:31.420 --> 28:32.938
than they're telling us?

28:32.940 --> 28:35.289
There's always more to
the story with Maggie.

28:36.786 --> 28:39.036
[Alfie] Alright, my turn.

28:45.046 --> 28:47.879
[leaves rustling]

29:08.257 --> 29:10.046
[Esme] I don't have
to go to work you know.

29:10.048 --> 29:10.881
What?

29:13.203 --> 29:14.388
[Esme] I could stay here.

29:14.390 --> 29:15.965
Why?

29:15.967 --> 29:18.248
I don't know, we could talk.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.178
What are we gonna talk about?

29:20.180 --> 29:22.760
Anything Parnell, I feel
like we haven't talked in ages.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.617
We haven't talked in ages.

29:25.619 --> 29:26.769
Alright, fair enough.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.763
We used to talk all the time.

29:30.859 --> 29:31.895
When?

29:31.897 --> 29:33.554
When you were little.

29:33.556 --> 29:34.517
You used to sit on my lap

29:34.519 --> 29:37.097
and name as many dinosaurs as you could.

29:37.099 --> 29:38.869
Yeah, I don't remember that.

29:56.309 --> 29:57.718
I thought there were three of them?

29:57.720 --> 29:58.847
Three what?

29:58.849 --> 30:00.297
[Bill] Three kids.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.676
Marty's not with them.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.503
Well, it's good to finally
get to meet them I suppose.

30:06.799 --> 30:09.299
I honestly thought she was
keeping us under wraps.

30:12.579 --> 30:13.666
Was that Esme?

30:16.987 --> 30:18.403
Oh I need to shit.

30:31.420 --> 30:32.253
How is Esme?

30:33.859 --> 30:35.262
She's fine, why?

30:36.396 --> 30:39.071
There's a lot of tension
in that family unit.

30:39.073 --> 30:40.573
Must be difficult.

30:41.559 --> 30:44.559
Just let me worry about Esme yeah?

31:02.076 --> 31:03.643
It was a phantom shit.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.068
Excuse me, what are you doing in here?

31:08.070 --> 31:09.136
[Parnell] Looking for my phone.

31:09.138 --> 31:10.607
[Maggie] I told you,
you're not having your phone.

31:10.609 --> 31:11.440
I want to talk to Marty

31:11.442 --> 31:12.507
and this shit's doing my fucking head in.

31:12.509 --> 31:13.638
Oi, watch what you're saying.

31:13.640 --> 31:14.470
[Parnell] Where is it?

31:14.472 --> 31:15.470
In the car?

31:15.472 --> 31:16.304
No.

31:16.306 --> 31:18.257
Don't keep on about the
fucking phone and Marty.

31:18.259 --> 31:20.077
Why are you being such a cunt?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.134
Oi, excuse me!

31:21.136 --> 31:22.507
I want my phone.

31:22.509 --> 31:23.341
Don't talk to me like I'm one

31:23.343 --> 31:24.488
of your little fucking pals!

31:24.490 --> 31:25.562
Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

31:25.564 --> 31:26.394
I'm your mom!

31:26.396 --> 31:27.228
Yeah? Seriously?

31:27.230 --> 31:28.061
- What are you gonna do?
- Yeah!

31:28.063 --> 31:33.063
[Parnell] What in the fuck
are you gonna do about it?

31:34.883 --> 31:37.643
Exactly.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.682
[Maggie] Where you going?

31:38.684 --> 31:39.798
Wherever the fuck I want.

31:39.800 --> 31:40.780
It's not in the car.

31:40.782 --> 31:42.115
I threw it away.

31:43.670 --> 31:46.741
On the drive down I threw it
in a skip with your clothes.

31:46.743 --> 31:47.574
[Parnell] What for?

31:47.576 --> 31:48.408
Well, I don't know.

31:48.410 --> 31:50.307
I thought it was the best thing to do.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.859
The phone is with my clothes?

31:54.472 --> 31:56.389
You're a fucking idiot.

32:26.974 --> 32:27.807
Morning.

32:28.801 --> 32:30.628
What are you doing skulking around?

32:30.630 --> 32:32.928
I was gonna see about getting
some of that gear off ya.

32:32.930 --> 32:34.248
You want to be friends then.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.579
You asked me to come.

32:36.789 --> 32:37.668
Actually, you know what, forget about it.

32:37.670 --> 32:39.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.077
Can you roll?

32:41.079 --> 32:42.388
Yeah.

32:42.390 --> 32:43.757
You can join me on my walk.

32:43.759 --> 32:44.591
What, now?

32:44.593 --> 32:46.547
Unless you have any other plans.

32:46.549 --> 32:47.517
Where are you going?

32:47.519 --> 32:48.698
Just through the woods.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.087
You can keep me company.

32:50.089 --> 32:51.527
Wait, why do you need my company?

32:51.529 --> 32:53.698
Oh, I don't know.

32:53.700 --> 32:56.350
Maybe I'm just bowed over
by your overwhelming charm.

32:58.069 --> 32:58.903
You coming?

33:10.895 --> 33:12.142
You alright?

33:12.144 --> 33:14.124
[Maggie] What are you up to?

33:14.126 --> 33:14.960
Work?

33:17.042 --> 33:18.160
[Maggie] I'm bored.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.793
I can't help you there I'm afraid.

33:21.705 --> 33:22.933
It's a lovely day outside.

33:22.935 --> 33:24.011
Go and enjoy the sun.

33:24.013 --> 33:24.844
I hate the sun.

33:24.846 --> 33:26.478
You hate the sun?

33:26.480 --> 33:27.648
Jump in the pool.

33:27.650 --> 33:28.480
I can't swim.

33:28.482 --> 33:29.757
I don't like water.

33:29.759 --> 33:31.408
You live by the sea.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.938
You're having a laugh ain't ya?

33:32.940 --> 33:34.882
No one swims in that.

33:34.884 --> 33:37.153
You get all this shit that
comes down from the Thames.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.138
Okay, I'm running some
errands in town later,

33:40.140 --> 33:41.228
you can come with me.

33:41.230 --> 33:42.730
Yeah please, yeah, anything.

33:44.019 --> 33:44.853
Okay.

33:46.549 --> 33:48.772
Okay, I'm gonna crack on.

33:55.147 --> 33:56.947
So what's your problem with shoes?

33:58.109 --> 33:58.942
Nothing.

33:59.900 --> 34:01.218
I love shoes.

34:01.220 --> 34:03.932
I just really love the feeling ya know.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.262
Your feet connecting with the earth.

34:08.268 --> 34:09.659
Energizes your soul.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.012
You should give it a go.

34:12.014 --> 34:13.847
I'm alright, thanks.

34:33.585 --> 34:36.170
[somber music]

35:14.847 --> 35:15.679
[Esme] Karen?

35:15.681 --> 35:16.628
[Karen] Yes.

35:16.630 --> 35:17.570
I'm not feeling that well,

35:17.572 --> 35:20.217
is it okay if I take
the rest of the day off?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.050
[Karen] Are you okay?

35:21.052 --> 35:23.998
No not really, I'm feeling
like I'm gonna pass out.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.617
[Karen] Okay, get yourself home.

35:25.619 --> 35:26.537
Are you sure you're okay
to walk home by yourself?

35:26.539 --> 35:27.597
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:27.599 --> 35:28.430
[Karen] Should I phone Alfie?

35:28.432 --> 35:29.264
No, no, no.

35:29.266 --> 35:30.293
It's okay.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.663
I'll call him if I feel faint or anything.

35:45.199 --> 35:47.269
Where are we going man?

35:47.271 --> 35:48.105
This is long.

35:50.824 --> 35:53.574
[rustling water]

36:42.809 --> 36:44.791
[Alfie] All I want from her
is a consistent mood you know?

36:44.793 --> 36:46.208
Well if they were consistent

36:46.210 --> 36:47.742
they wouldn't be called moods.

36:47.744 --> 36:49.197
Yeah, I suppose not.

36:49.199 --> 36:50.847
She's always been a stress head.

36:50.849 --> 36:52.597
Some people just like the drama.

36:52.599 --> 36:54.728
She's been working
really hard on herself.

36:54.730 --> 36:55.748
She's changed a lot.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.728
You think?

36:56.730 --> 36:58.668
Yeah, for the better.

36:58.670 --> 36:59.987
She certainly thinks
she's better than me.

36:59.989 --> 37:01.389
I don't think that's true.

37:02.590 --> 37:04.447
I don't think people
really change anyway.

37:04.449 --> 37:05.280
Why?

37:05.282 --> 37:06.237
Well I don't.

37:06.239 --> 37:08.327
They just hide bits of themselves.

37:08.329 --> 37:09.529
What's the difference?

37:10.900 --> 37:14.008
If your attitude is
different, your relationships.

37:14.010 --> 37:15.918
Well 'cause it's always
still there inside ya.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.338
Waiting to pop the fuck back up.

37:18.340 --> 37:20.767
I don't think people are finite.

37:20.769 --> 37:23.063
I think you have the capacity
to change your brain.

37:24.349 --> 37:26.017
We're too old for that.

37:26.019 --> 37:28.028
I'm carved in stone, warts and all.

37:28.030 --> 37:29.367
No one's ever too old.

37:29.369 --> 37:30.987
Well you're not that far behind me.

37:30.989 --> 37:32.200
I wouldn't go that far.

37:32.202 --> 37:33.809
Oi!

37:33.811 --> 37:35.193
I'm not over the hill yet.

37:35.195 --> 37:36.813
It's good to know.

37:36.815 --> 37:38.365
Oh I do miss clubbing though.

37:39.344 --> 37:40.487
Like properly clubbing.

37:40.489 --> 37:41.856
Were you into all that?

37:41.858 --> 37:42.740
Me?

37:42.742 --> 37:44.278
No, no, not really.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.467
God I was.

37:45.469 --> 37:46.677
We used to go out Friday night

37:46.679 --> 37:48.287
and come home Monday morning.

37:48.289 --> 37:49.440
It's pretty hardcore.

37:50.597 --> 37:52.753
You only get one go around.

37:52.755 --> 37:54.838
[Alfie] Yeah I suppose.

38:12.844 --> 38:15.594
[rustling winds]

38:27.730 --> 38:28.730
Log flume.

38:30.146 --> 38:32.195
It's two words.

38:32.197 --> 38:33.166
Hyphenated.

38:33.168 --> 38:35.001
Nah, it's two words.

38:37.751 --> 38:38.585
Falafel.

38:44.376 --> 38:45.793
[Bill] Falafel.

38:50.989 --> 38:51.822
Falafel.

39:01.271 --> 39:03.418
I couldn't sleep the other
night so I went for a walk,

39:03.420 --> 39:05.387
and I came by your place.

39:05.389 --> 39:06.958
Yeah?

39:06.960 --> 39:09.583
You got some strange
noises coming out of there.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.793
Yeah.

39:16.266 --> 39:17.402
Yeah, like singing.

39:20.735 --> 39:23.318
[Bill humming]

39:28.780 --> 39:30.380
Yeah, that's right.

39:31.697 --> 39:33.393
Yeah, it was weird.

39:37.079 --> 39:37.913
What was it?

39:39.260 --> 39:40.307
That's a medicine song.

39:40.309 --> 39:42.012
What the fuck's a medicine song?

39:43.838 --> 39:48.048
A song you use during
a healing ceremony.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.500
So what's a healing ceremony?

39:54.003 --> 39:56.086
That's a good question.

39:57.586 --> 40:01.907
So I spent some time
in a village in Brazil.

40:01.909 --> 40:03.432
Way way way in the jungle.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.050
And this tribe had the tradition

40:06.052 --> 40:09.987
that all the young men, when
they reached a certain age,

40:09.989 --> 40:11.552
maybe the same age as yourself,

40:12.530 --> 40:14.648
they would head off into
the jungle for weeks.

40:14.650 --> 40:18.023
Sometimes months on end,
on these long hunts.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.258
Kind of like a right of passage.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.347
And they would take a Shaman with them.

40:24.349 --> 40:25.250
What's a Shaman?

40:27.063 --> 40:29.358
A kind of a medicine man.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.663
Witch doctor if you will.

40:33.989 --> 40:37.327
So sometimes they would get lost,

40:37.329 --> 40:38.517
and when they got lost they would

40:38.519 --> 40:39.440
turn to the Shaman

40:40.407 --> 40:42.407
and the Shaman would
give them this medicine

40:42.409 --> 40:43.529
and perform a ceremony

40:44.530 --> 40:46.280
and they would find their way home.

40:47.170 --> 40:49.508
So over time, the tribe started to use

40:49.510 --> 40:51.597
this medicine as part
of everything they did,

40:51.599 --> 40:52.583
not just hunting.

40:53.610 --> 40:58.610
So if someone felt lost,
they would take the medicine,

40:58.860 --> 41:01.030
take part in the ceremony,

41:01.032 --> 41:02.722
and try and find their way home.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.133
[men laughing]

41:30.626 --> 41:31.459
Oh hey.

41:32.773 --> 41:34.021
Hi.

41:34.023 --> 41:34.854
Yeah, can you go inside please?

41:34.856 --> 41:35.913
I need to talk to my mom.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.113
Yeah alright.

41:45.268 --> 41:46.374
Is that Marty?

41:46.376 --> 41:47.206
Is what Marty?

41:47.208 --> 41:48.552
Read the fucking article.

41:49.969 --> 41:51.867
Just a slap huh?

41:51.869 --> 41:52.700
Just a fight?

41:52.702 --> 41:54.028
That's nothing to do with Marty.

41:54.030 --> 41:54.943
Don't lie to me.

41:56.230 --> 41:57.347
We're going to the police.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.168
What are you talking about?

41:59.170 --> 42:00.898
Me, you, and Parnell,

42:00.900 --> 42:03.075
we're going to the police, now.

42:03.077 --> 42:04.208
Look, I think you need to calm down.

42:04.210 --> 42:06.347
I don't need to calm down Maggie.

42:06.349 --> 42:07.180
Ring them.

42:07.182 --> 42:08.537
No!

42:08.539 --> 42:09.498
Ah, what's this about?

42:09.500 --> 42:12.338
Is it 'cause I've been out for
a drink with your boyfriend?

42:12.340 --> 42:13.173
What?

42:14.137 --> 42:15.822
Are you fucking insane?

42:16.949 --> 42:18.168
This isn't a trivial thing.

42:18.170 --> 42:19.307
You can't stay here.

42:19.309 --> 42:20.398
It's not safe.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.231
Ring them.

42:21.233 --> 42:22.066
No!

42:24.829 --> 42:25.663
Then I will.

42:27.010 --> 42:28.003
[Maggie] No.

42:28.005 --> 42:28.836
[Esme] What?

42:28.838 --> 42:30.742
[Maggie] Phone, give
me the fucking phone!

42:30.744 --> 42:31.575
[Maggie slapping]

42:31.577 --> 42:32.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:32.411 --> 42:33.450
Sort your fucking misses there mate!

42:33.452 --> 42:35.628
Maggie, don't hit people like that.

42:35.630 --> 42:37.430
Es, are you alright?

42:38.621 --> 42:39.639
Give me my phone!

42:39.641 --> 42:40.494
No!

42:40.496 --> 42:41.427
[Esme] Give me it back!

42:41.429 --> 42:42.568
Tell you what, carry on and I'll fucking

42:42.570 --> 42:43.873
smash the fucking thing!

42:46.099 --> 42:47.228
[Esme] Give me your phone.

42:47.230 --> 42:48.358
[Alfie] What for?

42:48.360 --> 42:49.748
Alfie, give me your phone.

42:49.750 --> 42:51.387
[Bill] Esme, slow down.

42:51.389 --> 42:53.228
This has nothing to do with you Bill.

42:53.230 --> 42:54.061
[Alfie] Dad please.

42:54.063 --> 42:54.894
Give me your phone Alfie.

42:54.896 --> 42:56.146
Es!

42:56.148 --> 42:57.157
No!

42:57.159 --> 42:58.110
Now Esme, don't stop!

42:58.112 --> 42:59.555
Look, look, look, look,
we'll talk alright?

42:59.557 --> 43:01.164
You and me go somewhere
and we'll talk together.

43:01.166 --> 43:02.327
Just you and me.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.161
What?

43:03.163 --> 43:05.063
So you can take another swipe at me again?

43:05.065 --> 43:05.896
No.

43:05.898 --> 43:07.318
No thanks you're a fucking nutcase.

43:07.320 --> 43:08.150
Am I?

43:08.152 --> 43:08.983
I'm gonna call the police

43:08.985 --> 43:10.938
and there's fuck all you can do about it!

43:10.940 --> 43:11.771
Tell you what, you say that and...

43:11.773 --> 43:12.780
Fuck sakes!

43:16.110 --> 43:18.077
So what's your plan then huh?

43:18.079 --> 43:19.329
My plan?

43:19.331 --> 43:20.898
Do I look like someones
who's got a fucking plan?

43:20.900 --> 43:23.008
Well either way, Marty's done.

43:23.010 --> 43:24.108
He's gonna go to jail,

43:24.110 --> 43:25.807
and if you don't want Parnell to join him

43:25.809 --> 43:26.717
then you're gonna take him home

43:26.719 --> 43:28.465
so he can tell the police what he knows!

43:28.467 --> 43:29.298
That's not gonna happen alright!

43:29.300 --> 43:30.787
That's not your decision to make!

43:30.789 --> 43:32.712
Well you can't stay here forever!

43:35.539 --> 43:36.373
Parnell!

43:41.449 --> 43:43.818
Okay, breathe.

43:43.820 --> 43:46.103
Let's everyone just take it down a key.

43:47.099 --> 43:47.930
Breathe.

43:47.932 --> 43:48.882
I am fucking breathing.

43:59.858 --> 44:00.692
Phone.

44:03.909 --> 44:05.502
Nobody's calling the police.

44:06.539 --> 44:08.472
Nobody's grabbing each others phone.

44:09.340 --> 44:10.798
We're a family.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.508
We converse.

44:12.510 --> 44:15.593
We express our ideas
in a civilized fashion.

44:18.059 --> 44:19.728
Well I don't feel like
talking right now Bill.

44:19.730 --> 44:20.758
Thanks all the same.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.560
Okay okay.

44:23.815 --> 44:26.358
Then we depart and we reconvene at a time

44:26.360 --> 44:28.503
when we are emotionally available.

44:40.510 --> 44:41.670
But before you go...

44:53.159 --> 44:54.947
I'm sorry Maggie.

44:54.949 --> 44:56.422
I'm sorry for pressuring you.

44:57.420 --> 44:58.920
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

45:01.219 --> 45:03.998
I'm sorry for any stress or hurtfulness

45:04.000 --> 45:05.193
I have inflicted.

45:06.929 --> 45:09.543
I'm sorry I slapped you
in the face with your phone.

45:09.545 --> 45:10.503
[Bill] Well done.

45:10.505 --> 45:11.755
[Esme] Alfie.

45:21.070 --> 45:24.088
Well I see you've had
a productive day then.

45:24.090 --> 45:25.608
I had some stuff to do in town

45:25.610 --> 45:27.267
and your mom was bored so I thought

45:27.269 --> 45:28.987
I'd take her with me.

45:28.989 --> 45:29.820
Took her where?

45:29.822 --> 45:31.117
Drinking?

45:31.119 --> 45:32.462
Look, she's stressed Es.

45:33.476 --> 45:34.838
I thought I'd let her off some steam.

45:34.840 --> 45:37.987
She does nothing but
let off steam Alfie.

45:37.989 --> 45:40.037
And you seem to be
having a fair few drinks

45:40.039 --> 45:41.539
since they've arrived as well.

45:43.449 --> 45:44.905
Between you and your dad...

45:44.907 --> 45:45.822
What's he done?

45:47.329 --> 45:49.717
They've both come back
stoned off their heads,

45:49.719 --> 45:51.287
cheeks swollen up over their eyes

45:51.289 --> 45:53.092
like some bloody Eskimos.

45:54.360 --> 45:57.517
[Alfie chuckling]

45:57.519 --> 45:58.628
- It's not fucking funny Alfie!
- It's quite funny.

45:58.630 --> 46:00.702
[Esme] They're not on holiday.

46:02.869 --> 46:03.798
No I understand.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.722
I don't actually think you do.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.549
What, who's this?

46:11.510 --> 46:12.343
That's Marty.

46:13.757 --> 46:14.592
That's my brother.

46:33.347 --> 46:35.431
Am I close to the curb?

46:43.003 --> 46:43.898
[car clanking]

46:43.900 --> 46:45.423
Oh, am I good?

46:48.369 --> 46:50.233
[John] What's the flat number?

46:50.235 --> 46:51.217
What?

46:51.219 --> 46:52.637
What's the flat number?

46:52.639 --> 46:53.472
I'll go up.

46:54.835 --> 46:56.595
I don't think that's the best idea mate.

46:56.597 --> 46:58.597
No, I'm done sitting in a car.

46:58.599 --> 47:00.577
Tell me the number, I'm going up.

47:00.579 --> 47:02.767
Well, you know, let's just do what

47:02.769 --> 47:03.807
we've been doing alright?

47:03.809 --> 47:05.887
Until we get a grip on what happened.

47:05.889 --> 47:08.148
I've got a grip on what happened.

47:08.150 --> 47:10.597
Alright, let's not get excited John.

47:10.599 --> 47:11.907
I'm not excited.

47:11.909 --> 47:13.088
Then we should go up together yeah?

47:13.090 --> 47:13.923
No.

47:14.851 --> 47:15.682
No.

47:15.684 --> 47:17.084
You can sit here like I've been.

47:17.086 --> 47:20.778
Sat here like a fucking
dog with the window down.

47:20.780 --> 47:22.728
Tell me the number, I'm going up!

47:22.730 --> 47:23.987
Just wait two minutes John.

47:23.989 --> 47:24.820
For fucks sake.

47:24.822 --> 47:25.653
Listen, give me the fucking,

47:25.655 --> 47:27.398
just give me the fucking number!

47:27.400 --> 47:28.231
Alright!

47:28.233 --> 47:29.298
Flat 27!

47:29.300 --> 47:30.677
[John] Fucking thank you!

47:31.940 --> 47:34.607
[ominous music]

47:36.704 --> 47:40.621
I don't think it's the
best idea though John.

47:49.931 --> 47:51.363
[Woman] Oh, sorry.

47:51.365 --> 47:52.615
It's alright.

48:20.284 --> 48:22.525
[Elevator] Third floor.

48:22.527 --> 48:23.443
Doors open.

48:44.025 --> 48:44.858
Shh.

48:49.405 --> 48:50.239
Shh.

48:53.590 --> 48:54.423
It's okay.

48:55.702 --> 48:57.075
[loud crash]

48:57.077 --> 48:57.910
Jesus, what the fuck was that?

48:58.210 --> 48:59.041
[loud crash]

48:59.043 --> 48:59.876
[wood splintering]

49:08.226 --> 49:10.420
What, what are you doing?

49:10.422 --> 49:12.588
You fucking little cunt.

49:15.405 --> 49:16.905
No, get off him!

49:18.739 --> 49:21.322
[head banging]

49:25.139 --> 49:27.722
[somber music]

49:54.320 --> 49:55.153
Please.

50:04.139 --> 50:05.806
Alright, let's go.

50:06.911 --> 50:09.827
[car engine turns]

50:18.271 --> 50:20.855
[horn honking]

50:30.344 --> 50:32.344
[Parnell] Can we talk?

50:33.362 --> 50:34.528
[Esme] Sure.

50:39.418 --> 50:42.168
Look, I'm sorry about all this.

50:44.755 --> 50:45.648
Don't worry about it.

50:45.650 --> 50:48.612
No, I see it gets to ya, us being here.

50:48.614 --> 50:50.057
I never said that.

50:50.059 --> 50:51.809
Yeah, but I see it.

50:54.070 --> 50:55.641
I don't know Parnell,

50:55.643 --> 50:56.568
it's not a good situation.

50:56.570 --> 50:58.398
I mean the longer you
hide, the worse it gets.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.593
Do you understand that?

51:03.239 --> 51:04.939
I just don't want to go to jail.

51:06.269 --> 51:07.947
And you won't have to.

51:07.949 --> 51:10.070
As long as you tell the
police what you know.

51:10.072 --> 51:10.903
What?

51:10.905 --> 51:11.737
Snitch on Marty?

51:11.739 --> 51:13.728
What Marty's done is wrong.

51:13.730 --> 51:15.514
You don't know that.

51:15.516 --> 51:18.767
The boy's dead Parnell,
that can only be wrong.

51:18.769 --> 51:20.920
Yeah, and if Marty
didn't do what he did,

51:22.650 --> 51:23.577
I'd be dead.

51:23.579 --> 51:24.411
So what are you saying?

51:24.413 --> 51:25.246
It was self-defense?

51:27.460 --> 51:30.333
The boy was stabbed 23 times.

51:32.043 --> 51:34.626
[somber music]

51:38.166 --> 51:39.568
Yeah, it's easy to
judge where you're from.

51:39.570 --> 51:42.273
Out here in your little walled off world.

51:43.980 --> 51:45.925
You know what you sound like?

51:45.927 --> 51:49.048
You sound like one of them
politicians who's happy

51:49.050 --> 51:51.228
to bomb some village in Afghanistan

51:51.230 --> 51:53.242
and call it self defense.

51:55.420 --> 51:57.307
But when it comes down to some
little kid at street level

51:57.309 --> 51:58.767
with a knife trying to defend themselves,

51:58.769 --> 52:01.648
nah scum, criminals,

52:01.650 --> 52:04.237
put them jail and throw away the key.

52:04.239 --> 52:06.157
There's always an other option.

52:06.159 --> 52:06.990
Oh and what would that be?

52:06.992 --> 52:07.824
Leave?

52:07.826 --> 52:08.657
Why not?

52:08.659 --> 52:10.577
Oh, and where would I go, here?

52:10.579 --> 52:12.907
Yeah, look at your face.

52:12.909 --> 52:14.476
The idea terrifies you.

52:16.280 --> 52:18.508
You don't have any idea

52:18.510 --> 52:19.597
how hard it is to have

52:19.599 --> 52:21.472
all this shit dropped on you.

52:22.849 --> 52:24.279
I have a life here.

52:26.007 --> 52:29.387
And I worked hard to get away.

52:29.389 --> 52:32.262
Yeah, and you couldn't wait to leave.

52:33.485 --> 52:34.878
That's not fair.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.552
You know what, don't talk about Marty.

52:38.778 --> 52:39.612
'Cause he looked after
me long after you left.

52:56.686 --> 52:59.186
[dog barking]

53:00.228 --> 53:01.878
Keys, cheers for this mate.

53:01.880 --> 53:03.088
Don't start.

53:03.090 --> 53:04.418
I'm serious mate, it means a lot.

53:04.420 --> 53:05.251
You're a fucking life saver.

53:05.253 --> 53:07.008
Listen, I don't wanna know.

53:07.010 --> 53:09.498
I ain't gonna pretend this
ain't a colossal inconvenience,

53:09.500 --> 53:10.333
'cause it is.

53:11.659 --> 53:14.378
You're not welcomed and it's not cool.

53:14.380 --> 53:16.211
But I don't have much
of a choice now do I?

53:16.213 --> 53:17.045
Mate, fucking hell.

53:17.047 --> 53:19.097
Look, I'm heading out now.

53:19.099 --> 53:19.965
I'll be back at six in the morning,

53:19.967 --> 53:22.090
when I get back do not fucking be here.

53:22.092 --> 53:22.923
Jamma...

53:22.925 --> 53:24.345
Do not fucking be here.

53:24.347 --> 53:25.898
I got my daughter tomorrow.

53:25.900 --> 53:27.298
I need you out of here before I get back,

53:27.300 --> 53:28.918
it's that simple.

53:28.920 --> 53:30.324
Well then you tell him that.

53:30.326 --> 53:33.318
Listen, I've known you a long time.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.836
And don't ever come into
my fucking house again

53:34.838 --> 53:36.637
throwing your weight around.

53:36.639 --> 53:38.430
I don't care who you're with.

53:38.432 --> 53:41.008
I've got my daughter
tomorrow and that's that.

53:41.010 --> 53:42.113
Alright, alright.

53:45.679 --> 53:47.345
What time is she gonna be here?

53:47.347 --> 53:49.653
Her mom drops her off
at eight in the morning.

53:51.313 --> 53:53.610
We'll be gone by seven.

53:53.612 --> 53:55.508
We'll be gone by seven.

53:55.510 --> 53:56.343
Make sure.

53:57.699 --> 53:59.731
I'm not staying here tonight
just so you know, ya?

53:59.733 --> 54:01.215
That's probably a good idea.

54:01.217 --> 54:03.938
But I will be back at
seven in the morning.

54:03.940 --> 54:04.967
Do not be here when I get back.

54:04.969 --> 54:06.913
We won't mate, trust me.

54:08.110 --> 54:08.943
Alright.

54:09.784 --> 54:10.907
Make sure.

54:10.909 --> 54:11.740
Promise.

54:11.742 --> 54:12.576
Thank you.

54:43.927 --> 54:45.300
[John] How's Jamma?

54:45.302 --> 54:46.148
[Malk] Jamma's sound mate.

54:46.150 --> 54:47.717
Look, I'll straighten everything out

54:47.719 --> 54:49.632
when he gets back.

54:49.634 --> 54:52.519
We won't be here when he gets back mate.

54:52.521 --> 54:55.550
Well he's gonna be out all night?

54:55.552 --> 54:57.488
I think it's for the best.

54:57.490 --> 55:00.657
You know, avoid tensions and what not.

55:02.079 --> 55:03.784
I'd rather he be here like.

55:03.786 --> 55:05.608
Why?

55:05.610 --> 55:07.559
Where the fuck is he?

55:07.561 --> 55:09.287
Do you know what I mean?

55:09.289 --> 55:10.398
Who's he with?

55:10.400 --> 55:11.557
I don't know who he's chatting to, do I?

55:11.559 --> 55:12.393
[Malk] John.

55:18.940 --> 55:19.996
What's Eric saying?

55:21.829 --> 55:23.373
He just dropped me a text.

55:25.309 --> 55:26.141
And?

55:26.143 --> 55:28.537
He says the kids
stopping with his sister.

55:28.539 --> 55:29.677
Alright.

55:29.679 --> 55:30.730
Across the channel.

55:32.050 --> 55:32.883
Alright.

55:34.440 --> 55:35.958
Well can he get an address?

55:35.960 --> 55:38.028
For fucks sake John, I don't know yet.

55:38.030 --> 55:40.137
People are not gonna be
falling over themselves

55:40.139 --> 55:41.818
to help us whilst we're
in this state are they?

55:41.820 --> 55:43.941
And what state is that?

55:43.943 --> 55:44.776
Huh?

55:46.219 --> 55:48.472
What did you think was gonna happen?

55:50.010 --> 55:51.628
What did you think I was gonna do?

55:51.630 --> 55:52.463
I don't know.

55:54.429 --> 55:55.447
But now we're in a bind,

55:55.449 --> 55:56.985
don't you think it might be an idea

55:56.987 --> 55:58.017
to give the young'n a pass?

55:58.019 --> 55:58.949
No I don't.

56:00.710 --> 56:04.688
Why, is that what you're thinking?

56:04.690 --> 56:06.778
Well we've already got
two dead kids on our hands.

56:06.780 --> 56:07.613
I know.

56:08.969 --> 56:10.219
One of them's my brother.

56:12.980 --> 56:14.079
Maybe that's enough.

56:15.239 --> 56:16.927
Maybe we're done for now.

56:16.929 --> 56:18.329
No, I'm not done here son.

56:23.050 --> 56:24.657
Yeah, little Savs.

56:31.085 --> 56:32.251
Little Savory.

56:34.780 --> 56:36.947
I'm just thinking, Savory.

56:42.291 --> 56:45.125
Must be a hard name to live up to.

56:54.951 --> 56:56.990
[door clicking]

56:56.992 --> 56:59.659
[water running]

57:48.353 --> 57:50.037
What the fuck is this?

57:50.039 --> 57:51.267
It's a medicine.

57:51.269 --> 57:53.267
I drink it when I'm cleansing.

57:53.269 --> 57:54.628
You drink it?

57:54.630 --> 57:55.537
Mm hmm.

57:55.539 --> 57:57.043
It looks fucking rank.

57:58.159 --> 58:00.048
Well you don't drink your own piss do ya?

58:00.050 --> 58:01.182
Not that I remember.

58:03.465 --> 58:06.237
There was this boy I
used to go to school with.

58:06.239 --> 58:08.389
His parents were like
hippies or something.

58:09.400 --> 58:10.700
They used to drink their own piss.

58:10.702 --> 58:12.758
I think they used to shower in it.

58:12.760 --> 58:13.748
I've heard of people doing that.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.264
[Parnell] Is it good for ya?

58:15.266 --> 58:16.663
I hear different things.

58:18.159 --> 58:19.960
He got fucking tortured at school.

58:32.563 --> 58:36.230
So what's with all the
religious books then?

58:37.320 --> 58:39.097
You have a problem with religion?

58:39.099 --> 58:40.258
No not really.

58:40.260 --> 58:42.199
Just, you got all the teams up here,

58:42.201 --> 58:44.407
I thought you had to pick a side?

58:44.409 --> 58:45.668
I don't know.

58:45.670 --> 58:46.978
Do I?

58:46.980 --> 58:49.258
It's all bullshit
really though, isn't it?

58:49.260 --> 58:50.228
All of it.

58:50.230 --> 58:52.302
No, some of it might be useful.

58:53.659 --> 58:54.758
Like what?

58:54.760 --> 58:56.728
10 Commandments.

58:56.730 --> 58:57.679
Do you know them?

58:58.880 --> 59:02.086
Thou shalt not do your mates misses.

59:02.088 --> 59:03.278
[Bill chuckling]

59:03.280 --> 59:05.068
Thou shalt not kill.

59:05.070 --> 59:06.555
Can you remember the rest?

59:06.557 --> 59:07.391
No.

59:08.590 --> 59:10.640
That's about as far as most people get.

59:11.590 --> 59:14.478
I'm sure that little list
came in handy at some point.

59:14.480 --> 59:18.282
In the end it's just
a collection of ideas.

59:18.284 --> 59:19.478
[Parnell] I thought
it was the word of God?

59:19.480 --> 59:20.521
Sure, isn't it all the word of God?

59:20.523 --> 59:22.998
Isn't what I'm saying now?

59:23.000 --> 59:24.767
If God's supposed to be everywhere

59:24.769 --> 59:26.807
and part of everything,

59:26.809 --> 59:29.222
isn't every action the act of God?

59:32.739 --> 59:34.152
[Parnell] Do you believe in God?

59:35.369 --> 59:36.202
I don't know.

59:37.059 --> 59:39.398
God's just a word.

59:39.400 --> 59:41.557
It's a way of describing something

59:41.559 --> 59:44.037
that's beyond description.

59:44.039 --> 59:46.682
And the Bible is just a book wrote by man.

59:47.579 --> 59:50.157
It has some really
beautiful ideas in there

59:50.159 --> 59:53.807
and not so beautiful ideas.

59:53.809 --> 59:56.110
You take what you need
and you leave the rest.

59:57.750 --> 59:59.418
Do you believe in guilt?

59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.121
Do I believe in guilt?

01:00:01.123 --> 01:00:02.249
Yeah.

01:00:02.251 --> 01:00:03.452
Do you not?

01:00:03.454 --> 01:00:04.447
Don't know, Marty used to say

01:00:04.449 --> 01:00:06.568
guilt was just the fear of getting caught.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.708
Marty and said that and you agree?

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:10.710
Don't know really.

01:00:12.199 --> 01:00:14.358
Take away fear and what have you got left?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.157
Maybe empathy drives that guilt?

01:00:18.159 --> 01:00:19.537
I don't know what that means.

01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:21.967
You've not heard of empathy before?

01:00:21.969 --> 01:00:22.800
No I've heard it,

01:00:22.802 --> 01:00:25.548
just don't know what the word means.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.938
It's the idea that you can put yourself

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.827
in someone's shoes and see the world

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:32.367
from their point of view.

01:00:32.369 --> 01:00:33.898
Isn't that just fear though?

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.733
How so?

01:00:35.684 --> 01:00:38.077
The only reason you'd put
yourself in someone else's shoes

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:42.057
is so that you don't
like, hurt or upset them.

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:44.217
That's considerate,
that's being compassionate.

01:00:44.219 --> 01:00:46.545
No, that's self preservation.

01:00:46.547 --> 01:00:49.767
That's me learning to keep you sweet

01:00:49.769 --> 01:00:51.262
so you don't fucking eat me.

01:00:52.159 --> 01:00:55.062
'Cause that's all anyone's ever
afraid of in the end right?

01:00:56.849 --> 01:00:58.299
And what are you afraid of?

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:01.807
Your brother was in prison right?

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:03.097
Who Marty?

01:01:03.099 --> 01:01:05.068
Yeah young offenders.

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:06.787
It ain't pretty.

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:07.889
What would you know?

01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:11.267
I know 18 months isn't
the longest of stretches,

01:01:11.269 --> 01:01:13.258
but it's 18 spent in probably

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.498
the worst place that you can imagine.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.331
Yeah?

01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:17.164
Where?

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:17.999
Nepal.

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.063
Fucking hell.

01:01:21.952 --> 01:01:25.613
That's exactly what
it was, fucking hell.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.918
And you wanna talk about religion?

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.637
I grew up with religion all around me,

01:01:29.639 --> 01:01:31.137
but this place...

01:01:31.139 --> 01:01:33.217
Yeah Marty said there were

01:01:33.219 --> 01:01:36.278
lots of kids converting to
Islam in Young Offenders.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.938
Yeah, there was Islam, Hinduism,

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.528
Buddhism, Christianity,

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.378
every fucking flavor you can imagine

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.333
and some you'd never heard of before.

01:01:44.389 --> 01:01:47.675
But you see these lads take to religion.

01:01:47.677 --> 01:01:51.621
You'd see them totally transformed.

01:01:51.623 --> 01:01:52.947
Yeah.

01:01:52.949 --> 01:01:54.688
You don't think so.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.577
Oh they might of looked transformed,

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.307
but people can act different.

01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:59.612
People can put up a front.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.650
But you back them into a corner...

01:02:04.289 --> 01:02:05.148
I suppose.

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.099
Maybe you're right.

01:02:08.255 --> 01:02:09.947
Have you found religion?

01:02:09.949 --> 01:02:11.498
Me?

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.333
No, no.

01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:15.498
But you can't see what I saw

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.550
and just keep thinking it's all bullshit.

01:02:18.409 --> 01:02:22.068
The 10 Commandments, the five
pillars, the golden rule,

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.938
wherever they come from
or whatever they mean

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.163
to individual people,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.353
they speak to something
about human nature.

01:02:33.164 --> 01:02:37.737
I just keep thinking about
them boys in that jungle.

01:02:37.739 --> 01:02:39.197
See here, can I get some
of that gear off you?

01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:40.706
I'm gonna have to think about

01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:41.545
that my friend.
[Alfie knocking]

01:02:41.547 --> 01:02:43.211
What do you mean?

01:02:43.213 --> 01:02:44.913
I'm blessed with visitors today.

01:02:45.769 --> 01:02:46.867
I'm gonna go back to the house.

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:47.929
Everything okay?

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.383
Yeah.

01:02:49.385 --> 01:02:50.298
We should something later, ya?

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.130
Yeah maybe.

01:02:51.132 --> 01:02:51.963
[Alfie] Are you sure?

01:02:51.965 --> 01:02:52.798
[Parnell] Yeah!

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.358
[Bill] I see you got caught in the rain.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.193
[Alfie] Yup.

01:02:59.659 --> 01:03:00.572
Shit!

01:03:01.599 --> 01:03:02.430
[Alfie] What?

01:03:02.432 --> 01:03:03.266
Nothing.

01:03:04.099 --> 01:03:05.382
What are you playing at?

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.697
What?

01:03:07.699 --> 01:03:08.822
[Alfie] With Parnell.

01:03:09.889 --> 01:03:12.690
Nothing, I like the kid.

01:03:12.692 --> 01:03:13.525
What?

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:15.340
I just don't think you should be playing

01:03:15.342 --> 01:03:16.569
games with him, that's all.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.307
Is that what I do now?

01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:20.467
Well he's not some middle aged woman

01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:22.517
with anxiety issues dad.

01:03:22.519 --> 01:03:23.528
I'm aware.

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:24.360
He's a kid.

01:03:24.362 --> 01:03:25.562
And what's your point?

01:03:26.923 --> 01:03:28.517
It isn't appropriate.

01:03:28.519 --> 01:03:30.508
And when would it be appropriate?

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.276
When he's a couple of
prison terms behind him?

01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:35.945
[phone ringing]

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.456
Hi mom.

01:03:45.458 --> 01:03:46.625
[Maggie] Hi.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.559
Look, I know we've
already apologized but

01:03:52.793 --> 01:03:54.443
I just wanted to say sorry again.

01:03:55.672 --> 01:03:56.505
It's not easy.

01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:59.313
What is this?

01:03:59.315 --> 01:04:00.767
[phone ringing]

01:04:00.769 --> 01:04:01.738
Sorry, it's Janet.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.663
I gotta let her know what's
going on with the car.

01:04:04.619 --> 01:04:05.450
[Bill] Look, I'm sorry.

01:04:05.452 --> 01:04:06.282
Here's the thing Bill.

01:04:06.284 --> 01:04:07.522
It was shit.

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:11.523
It was a betrayal of trust
and you took advantage of her.

01:04:13.699 --> 01:04:16.637
But what really mattered was
that at the end of it all,

01:04:16.639 --> 01:04:19.517
after all this pseudo spiritual bullshit,

01:04:19.519 --> 01:04:21.088
you didn't look after her.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.798
You didn't help her.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.021
Pseudo spiritual, is
that what it means to you?

01:04:25.023 --> 01:04:26.148
You didn't help her and you ended up

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:28.793
looking like just another
snake oil salesman.

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:34.258
The kid's got some real
shit to deal with dad.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.283
Far beyond you.

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:37.626
Just leave him alone.

01:04:39.364 --> 01:04:42.517
[door slamming]

01:04:42.519 --> 01:04:43.787
[Woman] Yeah who's there?

01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:45.092
Well it's Maggie.

01:04:45.094 --> 01:04:46.929
[Woman] Oh, who's number's this?

01:04:46.931 --> 01:04:49.441
Oh no it's my phone,
it's a different SIM.

01:04:49.443 --> 01:04:50.963
[Woman] Oh babes, how are ya?

01:04:50.965 --> 01:04:51.798
Oh yeah, alright considering,
we're hanging in there.

01:04:54.864 --> 01:04:57.655
[Woman] I'm so sorry babes,
I don't know what to say.

01:04:57.657 --> 01:04:59.289
How's Parnell?

01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:01.639
Yeah, he's hanging in there.

01:05:01.641 --> 01:05:04.461
[Woman] Yeah well, just
pass along condolences

01:05:04.463 --> 01:05:05.559
and for you too.

01:05:05.561 --> 01:05:07.959
We're all sending our love ya.

01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:08.795
Okay.

01:05:09.695 --> 01:05:13.601
Why'd you say that?

01:05:13.603 --> 01:05:15.284
Why'd you say, why'd you say condolences?

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.191
I don't understand.

01:05:16.193 --> 01:05:19.526
Why'd you say "passing our condolences?"

01:05:22.277 --> 01:05:23.110
Janet.

01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:26.525
[Janet] I don't know, Maggie.

01:05:26.527 --> 01:05:28.088
I don't know what you're saying.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:28.920
What do you mean?

01:05:28.922 --> 01:05:31.108
You said "passing our love."

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:32.161
What's happened?

01:05:32.163 --> 01:05:33.702
[Janet] I thought you knew Maggie.

01:05:33.704 --> 01:05:35.249
I'm so sorry.

01:05:35.251 --> 01:05:37.682
You thought I knew what?

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.514
[Janet] I'm really sorry Maggie.

01:05:40.516 --> 01:05:42.162
Janet please.

01:05:42.164 --> 01:05:43.831
Please don't, don't.

01:05:45.012 --> 01:05:45.846
Janet!

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.825
[Janet] Has no one
been in touch with you?

01:05:48.827 --> 01:05:50.660
I threw my SIM away.

01:05:52.472 --> 01:05:54.021
[Esme] Mom, mom, Parnell.

01:05:54.023 --> 01:05:56.021
[Maggie] Fuck.

01:05:56.023 --> 01:05:59.391
[door slamming]

01:05:59.393 --> 01:06:00.992
[Janet] Maggie, I
really thought you knew.

01:06:00.994 --> 01:06:02.144
I'm so sorry.

01:06:02.146 --> 01:06:04.679
Janet please tell me he's not dead.

01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:05.737
What's up with mom?

01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:08.582
Oh she's, she's just
had a skin full again.

01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:10.684
What are you doing here then?

01:06:10.686 --> 01:06:11.932
What do you want?

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:14.461
[Janet] I'm so sorry Maggie.

01:06:14.463 --> 01:06:15.796
What happened?

01:06:18.951 --> 01:06:20.367
What do I want?

01:06:22.117 --> 01:06:23.097
I don't know Parnell, maybe I just want

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:24.492
my family to be safe.

01:06:25.679 --> 01:06:26.512
What family?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.233
This family?

01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:32.559
[Maggie sobbing]

01:06:35.422 --> 01:06:37.289
Well don't worry about us.

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:41.624
You have your new family
to worry about, haven't ya?

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:45.210
[sobbing]

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:57.528
Just popping out for a bit,

01:06:57.530 --> 01:06:58.730
I'll see you both later.

01:07:05.746 --> 01:07:06.579
Mom!

01:07:07.788 --> 01:07:09.017
Mom wait!

01:07:09.019 --> 01:07:10.123
What's happened?

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:11.869
Look, just don't fucking say anything!

01:07:11.871 --> 01:07:13.387
Yeah, but what am I supposed to say?

01:07:13.389 --> 01:07:14.220
Nothing!

01:07:14.222 --> 01:07:15.179
Say nothing.

01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:18.103
[Esme] Mom!

01:07:39.045 --> 01:07:41.462
[TV hissing]

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.567
[door knocking]

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:03.393
[Bill] Hey, what's up?

01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:05.537
Is it too late?

01:08:05.539 --> 01:08:06.989
It's early enough, come in.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.131
So much noise inside my head.

01:08:20.314 --> 01:08:21.145
I can't breathe.

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:24.357
Okay, what do you want to do?

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:27.042
Do you want to hang out,
smoke a couple of spliffs?

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.563
It's a nice distraction, but
that's about all it really is.

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:31.397
I don't want a distraction,

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.483
I want it to stop.

01:08:33.828 --> 01:08:34.662
[Bill] Okay.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:37.600
Sit down.

01:08:37.603 --> 01:08:38.435
Can you help me Bill?

01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:42.720
Okay.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:08:59.509
Oi, oi.

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:08.015
[Malk coughing]

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.920
Do you want anything from the shop?

01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:13.340
[Malk] No, I'm good thanks.

01:09:43.118 --> 01:09:45.868
[engine turning]

01:09:58.908 --> 01:10:01.408
[phone beeps]

01:10:17.452 --> 01:10:20.284
[window knocking]

01:10:42.019 --> 01:10:44.351
What's the craic here then?

01:10:46.686 --> 01:10:48.186
It's Eric, he's,

01:10:49.394 --> 01:10:51.644
he's got an address for us.

01:10:56.047 --> 01:10:58.380
Why is the engine running?

01:11:02.145 --> 01:11:03.563
It's the radio.

01:11:19.654 --> 01:11:20.487
[engine stops]

01:11:21.604 --> 01:11:22.436
What's the matter?

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.513
Go on.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.242
[Malk] What?

01:11:36.244 --> 01:11:37.077
Go on.

01:11:45.188 --> 01:11:47.807
I can text you the address if you want.

01:11:47.809 --> 01:11:49.726
[John] Write it down.

01:12:00.101 --> 01:12:03.014
[Malk] What about the car?

01:12:03.016 --> 01:12:05.112
I'll make sure it gets back okay.

01:12:05.114 --> 01:12:08.697
It's just Jamma's,
that's all I'm saying.

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:14.917
I'm sorry John.

01:12:41.119 --> 01:12:43.019
You might wanna take your boots off.

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:53.723
Here, sit down on the,
sit down on the rug.

01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:10.090
What happens?

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:18.884
If the medicine takes,
you'll have a vision.

01:13:18.886 --> 01:13:21.088
[Parnell] What, like tripping?

01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:23.590
A little bit more than that.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:47.403
[Bill speaking in ancient language]

01:14:13.673 --> 01:14:15.006
Do I drink it?

01:14:26.398 --> 01:14:29.315
[Parnell coughing]

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.312
What's that for?

01:14:31.314 --> 01:14:32.357
[Bill] In case you're sick.

01:14:32.359 --> 01:14:34.037
I'm meant to be sick?

01:14:34.039 --> 01:14:35.119
Try not to talk.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:03.621
[leaves rustling]

01:15:09.819 --> 01:15:14.819
[slow paced music]
[Bill humming]

01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:42.301
[snake rattling]

01:17:04.655 --> 01:17:07.323
[Bill chanting]

01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:48.903
[footsteps approaching]

01:18:18.939 --> 01:18:21.439
[dog barking]

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.227
[water running]

01:18:48.993 --> 01:18:50.411
[Maggie] Night.

01:18:56.005 --> 01:18:57.349
Goodnight mom.

01:18:57.351 --> 01:18:58.769
[Maggie] Night.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.853
[leaves rattling]

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:45.237
[woman whispering]

01:20:29.716 --> 01:20:31.299
[Bill] It's okay.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.347
[Parnell vomiting]

01:20:48.641 --> 01:20:49.641
You're okay.

01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:04.486
[water running]

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:17.451
[Parnell] I just can't
explain how I feel.

01:21:17.453 --> 01:21:19.103
[Bill] You don't have to explain it.

01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:22.523
I feel connected.

01:21:24.619 --> 01:21:26.067
[Bill] Connected to what?

01:21:26.069 --> 01:21:26.969
Like everything.

01:21:31.555 --> 01:21:33.128
I'm sorry if I sound
stupid and everything but...

01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:34.333
No, not at all.

01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:39.530
You know, in Hinduism there's a philosophy

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:42.808
that everyone and everything is linked.

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:44.423
Everything is connected.

01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:48.503
You see a plant, it's not
separate from it's environment.

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:51.638
It needs the Sun, it needs the air,

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.353
it takes nutrients from the soil.

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:57.367
And without the light
and the air and the soil,

01:21:57.369 --> 01:21:58.323
it doesn't exist.

01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:00.222
It's all one system.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:02.643
They're all linked.

01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:26.897
Hey.

01:22:26.899 --> 01:22:27.732
You seen mom?

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.048
I've tried ringing her but her phone

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.937
keeps going to answer machine.

01:22:32.939 --> 01:22:34.458
I'm gonna go out and have a look for her.

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.367
I'll come.

01:22:35.369 --> 01:22:36.548
No, no, no, that's okay, I'll...

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:38.100
No, no, it's fine, I'll come.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.252
Okay.

01:23:14.015 --> 01:23:14.848
[bar ambience]

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.293
She's in the bar.

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.268
She's charming the locals.

01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:21.173
I told you.

01:23:23.905 --> 01:23:25.345
What do you wanna do?

01:23:25.347 --> 01:23:26.847
Well I'll go in and get her.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:31.582
Wait.

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:34.367
[Esme] What's up?

01:23:34.369 --> 01:23:35.420
Can I speak to you?

01:23:47.578 --> 01:23:49.410
You know it wasn't Marty right?

01:23:49.412 --> 01:23:50.447
What do you mean?

01:23:50.449 --> 01:23:52.124
What wasn't Marty?

01:23:52.126 --> 01:23:53.126
It was me.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.689
It was me and I'm sorry.

01:24:05.289 --> 01:24:06.625
I was only supposed to warn him,

01:24:06.627 --> 01:24:08.611
alright that was the plan.

01:24:08.613 --> 01:24:10.129
The plan?

01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:12.522
I was only meant to stab
him in the thigh or arse.

01:24:12.524 --> 01:24:14.838
Nothing bad.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.903
Just like damage him,

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:18.980
scare him off, like put him in his place.

01:24:20.662 --> 01:24:21.777
But once he hit the floor I could only

01:24:21.779 --> 01:24:24.498
think about what if he
got up, so I didn't stop.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.613
You planned it?

01:24:27.256 --> 01:24:30.462
I could say Marty, he put
me up to it, but he didn't.

01:24:31.815 --> 01:24:33.432
I could say Little Savs was a cunt,

01:24:34.539 --> 01:24:35.800
but none of that matters

01:24:35.802 --> 01:24:38.323
because I did that and
I can't take it back.

01:24:40.899 --> 01:24:41.842
It's weird,

01:24:44.529 --> 01:24:46.329
because when I thought it was Marty,

01:24:49.157 --> 01:24:51.432
all I could feel was anger and hate.

01:24:58.109 --> 01:25:00.437
And now I know it was you,

01:25:00.439 --> 01:25:01.519
all I feel is sad
