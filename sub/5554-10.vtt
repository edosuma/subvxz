WEBVTT

00:04.138 --> 00:05.704
(tires screeching,
horns blaring)

00:08.742 --> 00:10.074
You were picked
for a reason, Happy.

00:10.076 --> 00:11.675
You're supposed to be
our reckless driver.

00:11.677 --> 00:13.309
I'm driving as recklessly
as I can.

00:18.716 --> 00:20.382
Guys, a little help.

00:20.384 --> 00:22.083
Alley on the left!
HAPPY: Got it!

00:22.085 --> 00:24.085
(tires screeching)

00:24.487 --> 00:25.619
Turn right on Sepulveda!

00:25.621 --> 00:29.356
The point of this will be lost
if we don't survive the trip.

00:30.459 --> 00:31.758
I called in a favor with LAPD.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.460
They're giving you
a pass-through at LAX.

00:34.462 --> 00:36.128
(tires screeching)

00:38.732 --> 00:40.798
We're Gallo's crew.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.166
Customs, over there.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.567
Just in time!

00:46.405 --> 00:48.671
How necessary is the sign?
They're your parents.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.072
They haven't seen me
in 15 years.

00:50.074 --> 00:51.506
They've seen photos.

00:51.508 --> 00:52.807
There's an endorphin release
you get from seeing

00:52.809 --> 00:54.675
your name on a sign
at the airport.

00:54.677 --> 00:56.176
It's an indication
of forethought.

00:56.178 --> 00:57.777
That's what Toby says,
at least.

00:57.779 --> 00:59.411
There they are.

01:01.815 --> 01:03.047
Walter!

01:03.049 --> 01:05.315
You've grown up so handsome.

01:05.317 --> 01:08.584
Okay. Hello, Mother.
(chuckles)

01:08.586 --> 01:12.387
Uh, this is Paige and Happy,
friends and colleagues.

01:12.389 --> 01:13.688
This is Louise

01:13.690 --> 01:15.056
and Sean O'Brien.

01:15.058 --> 01:16.123
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.257
You, too.

01:17.259 --> 01:19.225
We don't have any luggage
but these.

01:19.227 --> 01:20.659
Uh, car's out front.

01:20.661 --> 01:23.528
It's fine.
I'll drive.

01:34.273 --> 01:36.640
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:38.677 --> 01:40.677
(weakly):
Sylvester.

01:40.679 --> 01:42.578
Hey.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.713
I'm just tidying
for your folks.

01:44.715 --> 01:46.614
They're gonna be here soon.

01:46.616 --> 01:49.283
Are they here yet?

01:50.252 --> 01:52.185
No, they're on their way.

01:52.187 --> 01:54.253
Walter just picked them up
from the airport.

01:54.255 --> 01:56.121
Mm.

01:56.123 --> 01:57.755
Uh-oh.

01:57.757 --> 01:59.289
(chuckles)

01:59.291 --> 02:01.557
He's gonna be fine.

02:01.559 --> 02:03.358
Megan's lung volumes
are, uh, decent.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.095
Functional capacity is up
to about 400 milliliters.

02:07.097 --> 02:08.529
Uh, all the likely
pathogens are, uh,

02:08.531 --> 02:10.697
showing sensitivity
to the antibiotics.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.465
And, uh, oh,
there is something

02:12.467 --> 02:14.266
that I've been
working on for her.

02:14.268 --> 02:17.135
I'm sure we'll get an earful
of information from the doctors.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.670
Hey, Walter.
These must be your parents.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.405
Yeah, they're my parents.

02:24.109 --> 02:25.374
WALTER:
Regarding Megan's care,

02:25.376 --> 02:27.142
there is an experiment
that I've been doing,

02:27.144 --> 02:28.843
and I have had some
success with it.

02:28.845 --> 02:31.145
This elevator's being used
for a quarantine patient.

02:31.147 --> 02:32.379
It's a routine
transport.

02:32.381 --> 02:33.747
East elevator's free.

02:33.749 --> 02:35.348
Okay, yeah, sure.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.583
MAN: Over to two!
So, um...

02:37.585 --> 02:39.851
Did that look
routine to you?

02:42.222 --> 02:43.738
(mumbles):
I don't know.

02:43.739 --> 02:45.255
So, even though her-her
body is failing,

02:45.258 --> 02:46.824
I'm trying to
figure out a way

02:46.826 --> 02:48.859
to transfer her mind
to digital storage.

02:48.861 --> 02:51.127
I'm actually running
tests in the garage...

02:51.129 --> 02:52.828
We came for Megan,
not science fiction.

02:52.830 --> 02:53.762
It's not
science fiction.

02:53.764 --> 02:55.814
I'm trying to save her.

02:55.815 --> 02:57.865
And if electrical
impulses in a computer

02:57.868 --> 03:00.635
can mimic impulses from-from
synapse to receptor,

03:00.637 --> 03:02.870
then we have great chance...
No, Walter.

03:02.872 --> 03:05.372
If Megan's being called home,
it's God's will.

03:05.374 --> 03:06.873
There is room for my will, too.

03:06.875 --> 03:08.875
I don't want to hear it.
SYLVESTER: Hi, good to meet you.

03:08.877 --> 03:11.811
My name's Sylvester.
I'm your son-in-law.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.447
Yes. Right.

03:15.449 --> 03:16.648
Megan's this way.

03:20.887 --> 03:22.486
That went well.

03:22.488 --> 03:23.787
I'm gonna keep
an eye on Walter.

03:23.789 --> 03:26.523
It might be a good time
to grab coffee, yeah?

03:26.525 --> 03:28.291
Could I have a refill,
please? Black.

03:29.294 --> 03:30.926
Thanks for coming, guys.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.429
(weakly):
Hey, guys.

03:37.399 --> 03:40.166
Oh, save your energy, love.
I'm right here.

03:43.871 --> 03:45.470
Hi, Dad.

03:45.472 --> 03:48.239
Hello, girl.

03:58.183 --> 04:00.883
Mm, Sylvester's.

04:00.885 --> 04:02.918
Do you have children, Sylvester?

04:02.920 --> 04:05.453
Oh, uh, no... Louise.

04:05.455 --> 04:06.920
It's all mine.

04:10.692 --> 04:12.825
Well, I should
get back to work.

04:12.827 --> 04:15.828
MEGAN:
No, Walter.

04:16.797 --> 04:18.963
Not at the dinner table.

04:18.965 --> 04:21.532
I don't understand
what that means.

04:21.534 --> 04:22.799
She's saying

04:22.801 --> 04:24.534
it isn't the dinner
table in Cork

04:24.536 --> 04:26.269
where you dashed off
the minute you ate

04:26.271 --> 04:28.337
to finish your
science project.

04:31.241 --> 04:33.241
Okay.

04:34.677 --> 04:36.810
(P.A. beeps)

04:36.812 --> 04:39.212
MAN (over P.A.): Dr. Kyle with
the infectious disease unit,

04:39.214 --> 04:41.214
report ICU 3. Dr. Kyle,

04:41.216 --> 04:42.882
infectious disease unit,
report ICU 3.

04:42.884 --> 04:44.834
You see that?

04:44.835 --> 04:46.785
Got this weird vibe the minute
I walked in the hospital.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.786
Something's up.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.921
You're not listening.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.923
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, a temporary lockdown

04:51.925 --> 04:53.724
of the hospital
has been instituted.

04:53.726 --> 04:54.958
Please remain calm.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.626
Do not leave your areas.

04:56.628 --> 04:58.327
There is a quarantine in effect.

04:58.329 --> 04:59.428
Airplane pilot tone.

04:59.430 --> 05:00.629
That means
we're losing altitude.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.964
Whoever made
that announcement is terrified.

05:02.966 --> 05:04.498
WOMAN:
Help! It's David!

05:04.500 --> 05:05.899
He's sick and there's
something all over him!

05:05.901 --> 05:07.567
I don't know
what happened!

05:07.569 --> 05:09.969
I need a doctor!

05:11.806 --> 05:13.906
Am I seriously
the only doctor in the house?

05:13.908 --> 05:16.008
He's in here.

05:16.010 --> 05:18.410
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't touch him!

05:18.412 --> 05:19.911
Gloves.

05:24.684 --> 05:27.284
(shivering)

05:31.023 --> 05:32.555
What the hell?

05:32.557 --> 05:35.257
Look at this.

05:39.596 --> 05:41.996
I've studied virulent fungi.

05:41.998 --> 05:43.964
That could be
a Stachybotrys fungus.

05:45.534 --> 05:48.601
Something is going down
in this hospital.

05:48.603 --> 05:50.636
HAPPY:
Oh, man.

05:50.638 --> 05:52.704
We're in the middle
of an outbreak.

06:04.450 --> 06:05.733
MAN (over P.A.):
The hospital is instituting

06:05.734 --> 06:07.017
a lockdown procedure.
No one may enter or leave

06:07.019 --> 06:10.420
without express consent
from hospital officials.

06:10.422 --> 06:12.055
Please stay in place.

06:12.056 --> 06:13.689
More information
will be provided shortly.

06:13.691 --> 06:15.424
I repeat, stay in place.

06:15.426 --> 06:17.492
Sir! You need to return
to your sister's room!

06:17.494 --> 06:18.559
I don't have time
for this.

06:18.561 --> 06:19.793
I need to get back
to Megan's research.

06:19.795 --> 06:20.794
I'm so close with it.

06:20.796 --> 06:22.362
Not sure you have a choice.

06:22.364 --> 06:23.563
We escaped
a burning building

06:23.565 --> 06:24.530
with a flashlight
and a solar panel.

06:24.532 --> 06:26.031
There is always a choice.

06:26.033 --> 06:28.700
I am guessing this is not
about research, Walter,

06:28.702 --> 06:30.635
because right here
is where you need to be,

06:30.637 --> 06:32.670
and you are running away from
everything in Megan's room--

06:32.672 --> 06:34.338
your parents, her health...

06:34.340 --> 06:35.906
I am not running
away from her,

06:35.908 --> 06:38.441
I'm trying to save her.
Excuse me.

06:40.411 --> 06:42.377
What are we
looking at, Doc?

06:42.379 --> 06:43.979
Well, if that's an outbreak
of Stachybotrys,

06:43.980 --> 06:45.580
these things usually follow
a pattern-- it's a mild rash,

06:45.582 --> 06:48.716
then cough, then full blown
respiratory failure.

06:48.718 --> 06:50.017
And given the bruising
under his fingernails,

06:50.019 --> 06:51.551
the liver's
affected, too.

06:51.553 --> 06:54.754
His level of exposure,
it's two hours until death.

06:54.756 --> 06:56.555
What about
our level of exposure?

06:56.557 --> 06:58.089
Just steer clear
of the mold on the walls.

07:00.893 --> 07:02.826
Which has already spread
out of the kitchen.

07:02.828 --> 07:06.429
You keep an eye on him.
Let me know if anything changes.

07:14.571 --> 07:16.070
Uh, a little help in here!

07:17.573 --> 07:18.638
Hello?!

07:23.778 --> 07:25.844
Okay, this will help us track
the fungi's progression.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.612
Right now, it's here;
left unchecked,

07:27.614 --> 07:30.481
it'll cross this line
in an hour, this line in two.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.517
Okay, and if it
reaches this last line?

07:33.519 --> 07:34.885
The issue is amounts.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.353
What we see on the wall

07:36.355 --> 07:37.654
is already emitting
spores into the air,

07:37.656 --> 07:39.589
so we're all breathing in
small amounts of fungus.

07:39.591 --> 07:41.708
This is okay,

07:41.709 --> 07:43.826
because our immune systems
can handle small amounts.

07:43.828 --> 07:45.727
But the more fungus that's
present, the more we breathe in.

07:45.729 --> 07:46.828
And then we're all dead.

07:48.798 --> 07:51.064
You know what, everybody,
opposite side of the room,

07:51.066 --> 07:52.565
away from the gunk
on the wall.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.567
And what is the gunk
on the wall?

07:54.568 --> 07:56.568
Uh, something we hope to keep
you far away from, ASAP.

07:56.571 --> 07:58.070
Good, because my contractions
are more frequent.

07:58.072 --> 07:59.137
Really?
Yeah.

07:59.139 --> 08:00.404
Oh, boy.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.676
Uh, you! Excuse me! Stop!

08:06.678 --> 08:09.045
Infectious disease?
That's just who I need.

08:09.047 --> 08:11.214
I'm a doctor.

08:11.215 --> 08:13.382
We got a guy in here with
systemic Stachybotrys.

08:13.384 --> 08:15.016
We have a similar patient
in the infectious disease ward.

08:15.018 --> 08:16.017
Is your guy responsive?

08:16.019 --> 08:17.518
Kinda.
Stable vital signs?

08:17.520 --> 08:18.836
Far as I can tell.

08:18.837 --> 08:20.153
All right, then he's better off
than my guy upstairs,

08:20.155 --> 08:21.687
and the ward is nearly
overrun with fungus.

08:21.689 --> 08:24.522
As soon as it's under control,
we'll send help.

08:27.426 --> 08:29.626
All is well.

08:31.029 --> 08:32.928
Okay, lay it
all out, Doc.

08:32.930 --> 08:36.665
Uh, if an adult goes down from
high exposure, it's two hours.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.733
But that baby will have
zero immune system.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.602
If it's born into this, right
now, won't last a half hour.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.136
(line ringing)

08:43.138 --> 08:45.571
Hey, Walt. It's me.
We got a situation.

08:45.573 --> 08:48.173
Name of the infectious disease
specialist that you talked to?

08:48.175 --> 08:50.392
It was Castillo.

08:50.393 --> 08:52.610
Okay, Happy, get me the
extension for Dr. Castillo now.

08:52.612 --> 08:53.944
Okay, I'm on it.

08:53.946 --> 08:56.846
Okay, this is commandeered
until we're out of here.

08:56.848 --> 09:00.616
Okay, I can't hack like Sly,
but I should have it shortly.

09:00.618 --> 09:02.851
Getting into the general server
would take hours,

09:02.853 --> 09:04.886
but I got in through
the security cameras

09:04.888 --> 09:06.520
in Castillo's ward.

09:06.522 --> 09:09.189
Zooming in on her phone.

09:09.191 --> 09:11.724
Okay, extension is 2-7-3-6.

09:14.528 --> 09:16.694
WALTER (over P.A.):
Dr. Castillo, please pick up.

09:16.696 --> 09:18.762
This is Walter O'Brien.

09:18.764 --> 09:19.896
Who is this?

09:19.898 --> 09:21.364
I run a team of geniuses

09:21.365 --> 09:22.831
that happen to be
in this hospital right now.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.834
Good for you.
Yeah, well...

09:24.836 --> 09:26.602
WALTER:
She hung up on me, didn't she?

09:26.604 --> 09:28.036
Uh, she did.
We can still assist.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.804
Have Toby learn
everything that he can

09:29.806 --> 09:31.739
about the patient in the
kitchen-- I'm sure that we can

09:31.741 --> 09:33.841
find a way to get me
out of here faster.

09:33.843 --> 09:36.543
Is that the goal?

09:38.213 --> 09:39.946
Oh, Walter should be back soon.

09:39.948 --> 09:42.681
He's, uh, trying to assist.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.685
This is a big guess,
but he's got a fever

09:47.687 --> 09:48.886
in the 103 region,
and the breathing,

09:48.888 --> 09:50.854
it's staccato,
it's shallower than before,

09:50.856 --> 09:52.821
indicating a decline.

09:55.492 --> 09:56.691
Happy.

09:56.693 --> 09:59.060
His wallet.

09:59.062 --> 10:00.728
Did he have blood
on his pants before?

10:00.730 --> 10:01.795
I didn't look that close.

10:01.797 --> 10:04.597
Scissors?

10:04.599 --> 10:05.831
Kitchen's have moisture
and protein.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.766
It's a perfect place
to grow a fungus.

10:07.768 --> 10:09.768
And if he's serving food,

10:09.770 --> 10:12.237
he could spread it
all over the hospital.

10:12.239 --> 10:15.072
This could be patient zero--
Typhoid Larry.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.742
Dirty boots, dirty cut.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.009
Uh, a receipt
for the public parking lot

10:21.011 --> 10:22.243
at Angeles National Forest.

10:22.245 --> 10:24.245
He's a hiker. I have an idea.

10:24.247 --> 10:26.247
And I hope I'm wrong.

10:33.656 --> 10:35.689
Uh...

10:40.128 --> 10:41.727
What? What is it?

10:41.729 --> 10:43.228
Gold.

10:43.230 --> 10:45.563
TOBY: I'm betting our cafeteria
worker was illegally

10:45.565 --> 10:48.098
prospecting for gold
in Angeles National Forest.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.233
We're not dealing with
Stachybotrys fungus.

10:50.235 --> 10:52.768
This guy cut his leg
and became a host for something

10:52.770 --> 10:55.637
much more dangerous:
Meliola anfracta.

10:55.639 --> 10:57.072
Why is it more dangerous?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.506
That's an ancient fungus--
they pull it out of

10:58.508 --> 11:00.841
artifacts from about
60,000 years ago.

11:00.843 --> 11:02.509
That doesn't answer
my question.

11:02.511 --> 11:04.110
And this numbskull could've
unearthed it while digging.

11:04.112 --> 11:05.644
Gold is a natural
fungicide,

11:05.646 --> 11:07.012
but once it's removed
from the soil...

11:07.014 --> 11:08.980
Why the hell
is it more dangerous?

11:08.982 --> 11:10.581
Okay, ancient Meliola
is much stronger

11:10.583 --> 11:12.649
and more resilient than
what we see nowadays.

11:12.651 --> 11:14.517
So it would react
very dangerously

11:14.519 --> 11:15.818
to a modern fungicide.

11:15.820 --> 11:17.586
Uh, then we have
a serious problem,

11:17.588 --> 11:19.287
because they're spraying
the infectious disease ward

11:19.289 --> 11:21.222
with a fungicide right now.

11:21.224 --> 11:22.823
Patching Castillo in.

11:22.825 --> 11:24.558
WALTER: Doctor, that is not
a Stachybotrys fungus,

11:24.560 --> 11:25.825
it is Meliola.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.193
How are you getting
on this P.A.?

11:27.195 --> 11:29.762
This is a fungus unlike anything
that you've seen before.

11:29.764 --> 11:30.963
It is far more resilient,

11:30.965 --> 11:32.798
and the fungicide
will not kill it.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.099
Call security.

11:34.101 --> 11:35.733
Exactly where are you, sir?

11:35.735 --> 11:38.302
The Meliola will view the
fungicide as a hostile attack.

11:38.304 --> 11:40.570
It will turn its energy
to reproduction.

11:40.572 --> 11:42.738
That means sending a huge
quantity of spores airborne

11:42.740 --> 11:44.039
and spreading much faster.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.107
(all coughing)

11:52.982 --> 11:55.048
Walt, they're filling the room
with toxic Meliola!

11:55.050 --> 11:56.849
Okay, Castillo,
cover the HVAC return.

11:56.851 --> 11:57.850
You need to do it now.

11:57.852 --> 11:59.017
Do it!

11:59.019 --> 12:01.152
Cover the return!

12:01.154 --> 12:02.820
(coughing continues)

12:05.791 --> 12:08.324
The entire
infectious disease team

12:08.326 --> 12:10.726
of this hospital
is incapacitated.

12:10.728 --> 12:12.027
We need to seal
the ward door

12:12.029 --> 12:13.628
before it leaks out
onto the ward hall.

12:13.630 --> 12:14.695
Uh, Happy, can you guys
get up here?

12:14.697 --> 12:15.696
I'm gonna need a hand.

12:15.698 --> 12:16.797
Uh, it would take an hour.

12:16.799 --> 12:17.798
They double dead-bolted
the fire doors,

12:17.800 --> 12:19.283
and I don't have
my pick tools.

12:19.284 --> 12:20.767
The fire door locks up here
are electronic.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.869
Can you pop them open from
the computer and get me through

12:22.871 --> 12:24.303
to the infectious disease ward?

12:24.305 --> 12:25.721
I'll do my damndest.

12:25.722 --> 12:27.138
Okay, Sylvester, can you
get Cabe up to speed?

12:27.141 --> 12:28.940
Get him to send
CDC reinforcements.

12:29.943 --> 12:32.677
Okay, Paige,
come with me.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.246
(door buzzes)
Good work, Happy.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.184
Oh, God.

12:43.987 --> 12:46.821
Toxin's nearly at the door.

12:46.823 --> 12:49.356
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
raid the supply closet,

12:49.358 --> 12:51.124
try to put together
a makeshift plaster of paris.

12:51.126 --> 12:54.026
I need you to go
to Dermatology down the hall.

12:54.028 --> 12:55.627
There are these
little, uh, canisters

12:55.629 --> 12:56.894
that look like
fire extinguishers.

12:56.896 --> 12:58.962
Bring me one, okay?
Hurry, hurry!

13:05.070 --> 13:06.869
(grunts)

13:06.871 --> 13:08.036
Here, use this.

13:08.038 --> 13:12.774
No, Dad, the doctors on those
pages are trapped unconscious

13:12.776 --> 13:14.142
inside this room.

13:14.144 --> 13:16.110
They can't help me
keep the toxins inside, okay?

13:16.112 --> 13:17.978
Stubborn son of a bitch.

13:22.117 --> 13:24.250
Use it like
a trowel, okay?

13:24.252 --> 13:25.718
Like laying bricks.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.985
Okay, okay, okay.

13:40.933 --> 13:42.899
The only problem is
it's not airtight

13:42.901 --> 13:45.001
till it dries--
it'll be an hour.

13:45.003 --> 13:46.035
PAIGE:
I got it.

13:46.037 --> 13:50.939
Not... if you have
liquid nitrogen.

13:52.042 --> 13:55.043
(plaster crackling)

14:01.084 --> 14:02.850
(grunts)

14:02.852 --> 14:04.384
All right.

14:08.923 --> 14:11.322
Solid as a rock.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.792
Uh, Happy?

14:15.794 --> 14:16.993
We have an HVAC return, too,

14:16.995 --> 14:18.394
and the mold's
growing towards it.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.613
Okay, that will spread
it everywhere.

14:20.614 --> 14:22.831
I'm guessing that the return
goes into a central system.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.899
We can seal this one,
but not every return

14:24.901 --> 14:26.066
in the hospital.

14:26.068 --> 14:27.667
Can the vents be closed
automatically?

14:27.669 --> 14:28.801
No.

14:28.803 --> 14:30.035
And we can't seal
them all manually.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.936
There must be hundreds
of them in the hospital.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.103
Okay, you need to shut down

14:33.105 --> 14:34.804
the main circulation fan
in the basement.

14:34.806 --> 14:35.905
Okay, can you get me there?

14:35.907 --> 14:37.072
I can try.
WALTER: Okay.

14:37.074 --> 14:38.940
You need to get back to Megan.

14:38.942 --> 14:40.041
So you're giving orders now?

14:40.043 --> 14:41.942
She needs you. I have this.

14:44.212 --> 14:46.745
Okay, now gather
any aluminum I.V. stands

14:46.747 --> 14:48.079
that are not attached
to patients.

14:48.081 --> 14:49.213
Make sure that they're aluminum.

14:49.215 --> 14:50.731
Okay.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.248
Our gold miner is declining,
and I think the preggo lady

14:52.251 --> 14:53.917
is getting
closer to bursting.

14:53.919 --> 14:54.984
That baby doesn't
survive in here.

14:54.986 --> 14:56.385
I didn't need
the reminder.

14:56.387 --> 14:58.987
Okay, Walt, you've got
open doors to the basement.

14:58.989 --> 15:01.389
(sirens wailing outside)

15:01.391 --> 15:02.923
Police. Word's out.

15:02.925 --> 15:04.391
They're gonna seal
off the building.

15:04.393 --> 15:05.959
(sirens wailing, urgent chatter)

15:08.863 --> 15:11.096
Walter, Toby, you there?

15:11.098 --> 15:13.298
Cabe, did you connect
to the CDC?

15:13.300 --> 15:14.832
They're flying in from Atlanta,

15:14.834 --> 15:16.767
but it's four hours
until they get here.

15:16.769 --> 15:18.835
We don't have four hours.

15:20.071 --> 15:21.837
WOMAN (over TV): The entire
hospital has been quarantined.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.405
No one is allowed
to enter the building,

15:23.407 --> 15:26.741
and anyone trying to leave
will be immediately contained.

15:26.743 --> 15:29.410
Hospital officials have
yet to release a statement...

15:29.412 --> 15:31.879
She's getting worse.
Walter should be here.

15:31.881 --> 15:33.247
He will be.

15:33.249 --> 15:35.482
Until then, she has us,
and she knows we're here.

15:36.985 --> 15:38.017
SEAN:
Right.

15:38.019 --> 15:39.818
Her family?
Sean.

15:39.820 --> 15:41.152
No. I want to know

15:41.154 --> 15:42.453
who this fella is.

15:42.455 --> 15:44.488
We find out from a call
that our little girl's

15:44.490 --> 15:46.957
gotten hitched to someone
who plays with toys.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.491
Who the hell are you?

15:48.493 --> 15:49.992
I'm Sylvester.

15:49.994 --> 15:51.426
What kind of man are you?

15:51.428 --> 15:54.996
The kind of man that's been
caring for your daughter.

15:54.998 --> 15:57.898
The kind that hasn't left
her side in three weeks.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.366
The kind that loves her.

16:01.036 --> 16:03.002
So you will just
have to accept that.

16:07.775 --> 16:11.143
TOY: My whoopee cushion of doom
will blast you to atoms.

16:11.145 --> 16:13.879
(farting noise)

16:13.881 --> 16:15.847
Okay.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.114
That's a big fan.

16:18.884 --> 16:21.050
Yeah, it's the circulation
system for the hospital.

16:21.052 --> 16:22.918
Now, if we can stop it,
we can prevent the spread

16:22.920 --> 16:24.786
of the fungus.
We can't hack the controls?

16:24.788 --> 16:25.987
Not online. Surveillance shows

16:25.989 --> 16:27.855
fungus covering
the control room,

16:27.857 --> 16:29.407
but we can use these poles.

16:29.408 --> 16:30.958
That fan will chew them up
and shoot them back at us.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.426
That's why we're gonna
use the MRI machine.

16:32.428 --> 16:35.061
Its magnet's not strong enough
to stop the blades,

16:35.063 --> 16:37.129
but we can slow it down to where
we can wedge those poles in

16:37.131 --> 16:38.763
so it won't spin anymore.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.164
Okay, Radiology is 20 feet away

16:40.166 --> 16:42.900
on the other side
of the north wall.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.334
Those machines have
their own Wi-Fi signal

16:44.336 --> 16:46.002
and are heavily encrypted.

16:46.004 --> 16:47.970
That kind of fancy finger-work
is beyond my ability.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.371
I need help.

16:49.373 --> 16:51.773
I'm in.
Reprogramming the MRI now

16:51.775 --> 16:53.474
to reverse
the magnet's polarity.

16:53.476 --> 16:54.775
(typing)

16:54.777 --> 16:56.943
(Megan coughing)

16:56.945 --> 16:59.145
Walter, you need to finish
and get back up here quickly.

16:59.147 --> 17:00.813
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

17:00.815 --> 17:02.214
Okay, let's get started.

17:02.216 --> 17:04.216
Uh, Walt, what's the engine size
on that fan?

17:04.218 --> 17:05.951
200 horsepower.

17:05.953 --> 17:06.985
1500m series.

17:06.987 --> 17:08.186
Okay, it sounds stronger.

17:08.188 --> 17:09.987
Factory must have
mislabeled that thing.

17:09.989 --> 17:11.389
What does it matter?

17:11.390 --> 17:12.790
Okay, if the horsepower
is higher,

17:12.791 --> 17:14.191
you may not be able
to keep the fans jammed up

17:14.193 --> 17:15.825
with the number of poles
you've got.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.159
Well, that's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.294
Sylvester?
I've got control of the magnet.

17:19.296 --> 17:21.296
(machine whirring, beeping)

17:21.298 --> 17:23.464
Take all the metal out of
your pocket-- no metal at all.

17:27.336 --> 17:30.036
Okay, Sly, turn the magnets on.

17:30.972 --> 17:33.038
(beeping, whirring)

17:36.877 --> 17:38.309
Okay, it's working.

17:38.311 --> 17:39.343
I don't know for how long.

17:39.345 --> 17:40.977
The MRI is already
overheating.

17:40.979 --> 17:42.144
This isn't exactly
its intended use.

17:42.146 --> 17:43.211
Okay, let's go.

17:45.114 --> 17:46.413
Okay.

17:52.353 --> 17:53.352
(rattling)

17:53.354 --> 17:54.419
Guys, we're losing
the magnet.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.421
(rapid beeping)

17:56.423 --> 17:58.956
The fan is too strong.
It's not working!

17:58.958 --> 18:00.390
(metal clangs, Paige gasps)

18:00.392 --> 18:02.291
No, no, no! No, no.
No, no, no. On the axle.

18:02.293 --> 18:04.393
Any shrapnel will fly out
from center.

18:09.099 --> 18:10.898
LOUISE (over phone):
Walter, are you there?

18:10.900 --> 18:11.899
Yeah, I'm here.

18:11.901 --> 18:13.400
Megan's awake. She's weak.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.168
She's asking for you.
Hurry, son.

18:15.170 --> 18:17.236
Okay, I need to get to her.
Let's go.

18:18.439 --> 18:20.272
Walter, the pole
compromised the door.

18:20.274 --> 18:22.073
I can't open it.
What?

18:24.243 --> 18:26.309
We're trapped.

18:32.617 --> 18:35.317
Come on. Come on!

18:35.319 --> 18:36.851
(groans)

18:36.853 --> 18:37.852
I need to get up
to see Megan.

18:37.854 --> 18:39.019
The plan for containment

18:39.021 --> 18:40.470
may have turned unfeasible.

18:40.471 --> 18:41.920
You said we
wouldn't get here

18:41.923 --> 18:44.023
for another two hours.
Did we time travel?

18:44.025 --> 18:45.991
Walter, the toxin's speed
has doubled.

18:45.993 --> 18:48.159
In 60 minutes, it'll hit
the ventilation system

18:48.161 --> 18:49.894
and everyone in the hospital

18:49.896 --> 18:51.428
is gonna be infected.
If we can't contain it,

18:51.430 --> 18:53.630
then finding a cure
is the only option.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.998
But everyone
equipped to find it

18:55.000 --> 18:56.265
is currently unconscious
in a sealed ward

18:56.267 --> 18:59.001
or on a plane
35,000 feet over New Mexico.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.569
(grunts):
Come on.

19:00.571 --> 19:03.371
The MRI is fried.
The door's pinned in place.

19:03.373 --> 19:05.439
Then we'll find something else.
What about that?

19:07.376 --> 19:09.409
Maybe there are
tools inside.

19:09.411 --> 19:11.043
(sighs)

19:13.013 --> 19:15.079
You hear that?

19:15.081 --> 19:16.831
Yeah.

19:16.832 --> 19:18.582
Close it up.
Move it out of the way.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.502
Whoa.

19:21.503 --> 19:23.053
(chuckles):
Oh. This is a dumbwaiter.

19:23.055 --> 19:24.988
Now, hospitals used it
to save labor

19:24.990 --> 19:27.924
and reduce exposure
to contamination.

19:27.926 --> 19:30.009
Well, that's ironic.

19:30.010 --> 19:32.093
Irony is a construct.
This is about logistics.

19:32.096 --> 19:34.896
That looks rusted over.
I don't trust that rope.

19:34.898 --> 19:35.997
Whoa!
Whoa, Walter!

19:35.999 --> 19:38.199
(dumbwaiter crashes)

19:38.201 --> 19:41.068
Okay, next.

19:41.070 --> 19:43.103
Anyone with medical training
will tell you that standard

19:43.105 --> 19:45.538
operating procedure is to get
a sample of the pathogen,

19:45.540 --> 19:47.206
grow it, and test against
a variety of fungicides

19:47.208 --> 19:48.640
over two to four weeks.

19:48.642 --> 19:50.859
We don't have
two to four hours.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.077
Well, unless an antidote falls
from the sky, we're screwed.

19:53.079 --> 19:54.244
MAN:
Guys!

19:55.981 --> 19:58.314
That's not what we needed
to fall from the sky.

19:58.316 --> 20:01.083
Okay, quick, we have to
sterilize the area for birth.

20:01.085 --> 20:02.684
Boiling water,
towels, mild soap.

20:02.686 --> 20:04.385
Okay, I'm on it.

20:04.387 --> 20:06.019
Why don't you
have a seat.

20:06.021 --> 20:08.021
Oh, it's gonna
be all right.

20:08.023 --> 20:10.023
HAPPY:
Doc!

20:10.025 --> 20:11.190
Get over here now!

20:11.192 --> 20:13.592
You got to tell me
what I'm looking at.

20:15.128 --> 20:17.094
How is that possible?

20:17.096 --> 20:19.629
That's not your hand.
You have tiny hamster hands.

20:19.631 --> 20:22.131
It's Sly's thermos,
so it's Sly's hand.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.398
I think I got it!

20:23.400 --> 20:25.433
I have a what on my hands?

20:25.435 --> 20:26.967
You've been O.D.'ing on
antibacterial

20:26.969 --> 20:28.134
since exiting the womb,

20:28.136 --> 20:29.401
and because of it,
you've developed

20:29.403 --> 20:30.668
a resistant superbug
on your mitts

20:30.670 --> 20:32.002
that counteracted the fungus.

20:32.004 --> 20:33.970
Sly, you need to test
Toby's hypothesis.

20:33.972 --> 20:36.038
I am very close to a full
psychological breakdown.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.640
Sylvester, it might
be our only shot.

20:38.642 --> 20:40.541
(sighs)

20:43.379 --> 20:44.378
(sighs)

20:48.350 --> 20:50.149
What the hell are you doing?

20:50.151 --> 20:52.117
Saving people's lives, I guess.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.985
Okay, you need to locate
a patch of fungus

20:53.987 --> 20:55.453
to test the superbacteria.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.689
Am I just supposed to search
the hospital until I find some?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.157
Yes. I will get you through
the fire door.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.224
(door buzzes, latch clicks)

21:05.128 --> 21:07.161
Okay, wasn't hard to find.

21:07.163 --> 21:09.663
Wish it had been harder.

21:09.665 --> 21:11.131
(sighs)

21:13.068 --> 21:16.069
Idiots shot these at me
for ten years.

21:16.071 --> 21:18.137
Okay.

21:26.146 --> 21:28.246
(chuckles)

21:28.248 --> 21:30.314
I have super powers.

21:30.316 --> 21:32.349
I am Bacteria Man.

21:32.351 --> 21:33.650
Super what?

21:33.652 --> 21:35.118
WALTER:
Superbacteria.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.820
But Sly doesn't have
enough on him

21:36.821 --> 21:38.521
to run around the hospital
laying hands on people.

21:38.523 --> 21:41.023
How good an idea is spreading
a superbacteria in a hospital?

21:41.025 --> 21:42.524
Sylvester is fine,

21:42.526 --> 21:44.292
so we can assume
that it just kills fungus.

21:44.294 --> 21:46.360
Now, we'll get the sample to you
to incubate to scale,

21:46.362 --> 21:48.428
essentially growing
a huge batch of the cure.

21:48.430 --> 21:51.030
How am I gonna do that
when every genius I know

21:51.032 --> 21:52.197
is locked in this hospital?

21:52.199 --> 21:54.332
Not every genius.

21:54.334 --> 21:55.533
(school bell rings)

21:55.535 --> 21:56.700
CABE:
Ralph, school's over.

21:56.702 --> 21:58.201
On your feet.

21:58.203 --> 22:00.036
We need your expertise, pal.

22:00.038 --> 22:02.071
Won't the kids think
I'm in trouble?

22:02.073 --> 22:05.273
Trust me,
the girls are gonna dig it.

22:07.510 --> 22:09.543
How do we get Sylvester's
bacteria out of the hospital?

22:09.545 --> 22:11.344
The place is locked down
until the CDC gets here.

22:11.346 --> 22:13.246
Nothing in or out.

22:13.247 --> 22:15.147
The sewage system extends from
the hospital to the street.

22:15.149 --> 22:16.314
But retrieving something
from the sewer

22:16.316 --> 22:17.748
makes me feel ill inside.

22:22.488 --> 22:24.788
Okay, so Megan's floor
has a fire hose

22:24.790 --> 22:27.757
by room 233 that must connect
to a network of standpipes.

22:27.759 --> 22:29.792
Now, if Cabe and Ralph
can create a vacuum

22:29.794 --> 22:32.094
at that extraction point,
then we can turn it into

22:32.096 --> 22:34.362
a pneumatic tube system,
like in a bank.

22:34.364 --> 22:36.163
I've just hacked the
county assessor's blueprints,

22:36.165 --> 22:38.331
and you can access
the other end of the standpipe

22:38.333 --> 22:41.067
from an alleyway on
the south side of the hospital.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.235
There's no exit, so there
shouldn't be a police barricade.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.103
With the suction,
we can retrieve the sample,

22:45.105 --> 22:47.105
grow the cure in the garage
with a high-protein liquid,

22:47.107 --> 22:48.339
and then bring it back
to the hospital

22:48.341 --> 22:50.507
for the CDC to distribute.

22:50.509 --> 22:51.741
I'll get the sample ready.

22:51.743 --> 22:53.175
Off my hand.

22:54.144 --> 22:56.410
I disgust myself.

22:57.646 --> 22:58.444
(exhales)

22:59.447 --> 23:01.447
Would you open this for me?

23:01.449 --> 23:03.048
Sure.
Thank you.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.249
Okay.

23:04.251 --> 23:07.151
Now slowly scrape a sample.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.553
Great.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.458
Wonderful.

23:18.261 --> 23:20.294
Okay.

23:24.633 --> 23:27.133
All right, could you pass me
that tubing?

23:28.169 --> 23:29.301
Thank you.

23:29.303 --> 23:30.635
What'll this be for?

23:30.637 --> 23:32.403
A slingshot--
we need something propulsive

23:32.405 --> 23:36.240
to make sure the sample reaches
the pull of the vacuum.

23:36.242 --> 23:38.742
Slingshots and spitballs.

23:38.744 --> 23:41.211
Maybe your kid stuff
is useful after all.

23:42.314 --> 23:44.113
This baby's getting ready
to roll.

23:44.115 --> 23:45.765
So's my stomach.

23:45.766 --> 23:47.416
Uh, I got Mommy.
You want to handle Daddy?

23:47.418 --> 23:48.483
(woman panting)

23:48.485 --> 23:50.084
Okay, dude?

23:50.086 --> 23:51.652
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
You gotta maintain.

23:51.654 --> 23:53.454
Okay, it's just engineering.

23:53.455 --> 23:55.255
Your wife's uterus is exerting
over 60 pounds of force

23:55.257 --> 23:56.623
per square inch right now.

23:56.625 --> 23:59.125
That's comparable to
a refrigerator compressor.

23:59.127 --> 24:00.493
Ten centimeters of dilation?

24:00.495 --> 24:02.328
It's like turning a Cheerio
into a bagel.

24:02.330 --> 24:04.730
Or pulling an orange
out of a wine bottle.

24:04.732 --> 24:06.732
The female body
is a mechanical marvel.

24:09.303 --> 24:12.637
Okay, let's get this show
on the road.

24:12.639 --> 24:13.771
What do you have for suction?

24:13.773 --> 24:16.206
I bought a leaf blower
at a yard sale.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.141
So use the power
from the hospital

24:18.143 --> 24:19.442
to juice the engine
when you reverse it.

24:19.444 --> 24:21.243
Got it. We'll call you
when it's ready.

24:21.245 --> 24:22.310
Okay.

24:25.415 --> 24:26.414
(metal clanks)

24:26.416 --> 24:27.515
Walter.

24:27.517 --> 24:29.617
Megan is dying
and I'm stuck down here.

24:29.619 --> 24:31.285
She's the only family
that I have.

24:31.287 --> 24:33.820
You have two parents
a few floors above you.

24:33.822 --> 24:35.154
The only way that I could ever

24:35.156 --> 24:36.522
talk to my parents
was through her.

24:36.524 --> 24:38.857
She's the only one that
understands me for what I am.

24:38.859 --> 24:42.293
She is the most important person
that I've ever had in my life.

24:43.562 --> 24:45.528
CABE:
<i> We're ready!</i>

24:45.530 --> 24:47.463
Bacteria coming your way!

24:47.465 --> 24:49.398
(air whooshing)

24:49.400 --> 24:50.465
(grunts)

24:52.202 --> 24:54.902
(rattling)

25:00.342 --> 25:01.708
I think it's coming!

25:01.710 --> 25:04.444
(air whooshing)

25:04.446 --> 25:06.179
Get ready!

25:07.348 --> 25:09.348
Here we go!
(Ralph grunts)

25:09.350 --> 25:11.650
You okay, kid?

25:11.652 --> 25:13.318
I got it.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.736
CABE:
We got the sample.

25:14.737 --> 25:16.153
That really worked?
Of course it did.

25:16.923 --> 25:18.689
It's your son's idea.

25:18.691 --> 25:19.756
LOUISE:
Sean!

25:20.759 --> 25:22.391
Sean!
She's having a seizure!

25:22.393 --> 25:23.392
SEAN:
What's wrong with her?

25:23.394 --> 25:24.726
She's... I don't know!

25:24.728 --> 25:25.893
(urgent chatter,
alarms beeping rapidly)

25:25.895 --> 25:26.927
Help her!

25:26.929 --> 25:28.728
(urgent chatter continues)

25:28.730 --> 25:29.929
MAN:
Keep hold on those legs.

25:29.931 --> 25:31.797
WOMAN:
Got it.

25:31.799 --> 25:34.166
Is that all
the doctor had to say?

25:35.836 --> 25:37.936
(phone beeps)

25:37.938 --> 25:39.904
Uh, Megan...

25:39.906 --> 25:41.205
had, uh, a seizure.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.173
She's semiconscious,

25:43.175 --> 25:44.741
but she's close...

25:44.743 --> 25:46.843
Walter.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.814
Okay, let's...
let's try to get out of here

25:51.816 --> 25:53.549
(straining):
again!

25:53.551 --> 25:57.352
Let's... let's try
one more time.

25:57.354 --> 25:59.954
Come on! Come on!

26:07.529 --> 26:09.896
Walter said bacteria require
heat and food to multiply.

26:09.898 --> 26:11.497
Something with sugar,
fat and protein,

26:11.499 --> 26:12.764
like the stuff
found in fish broth.

26:12.766 --> 26:15.466
We got anything like that?

26:15.468 --> 26:17.668
This should do it.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.336
That's perfect.

26:19.338 --> 26:20.770
Ray's strange.

26:20.772 --> 26:22.371
And how.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.439
(monitor beeping steadily)

26:25.308 --> 26:26.674
Sir?

26:26.676 --> 26:28.642
I know time is
precious right now,

26:28.644 --> 26:32.978
but if I could just
have a moment with her.

26:32.980 --> 26:34.412
That's all I ask.

26:37.383 --> 26:38.815
Okay.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.366
Megan, I made something for you.

27:08.276 --> 27:09.341
(sniffles)

27:12.446 --> 27:13.511
(sniffles)

27:16.449 --> 27:17.648
(whispers)

27:20.653 --> 27:22.653
Last week,
you said you were sad

27:22.655 --> 27:25.455
because you'd never
see the stars again.

27:29.294 --> 27:31.761
(weakly):
Thank you.

27:31.763 --> 27:33.829
(sighs)

27:36.300 --> 27:38.466
It's beautiful.

27:46.409 --> 27:48.542
Megan...

27:48.544 --> 27:51.511
my whole life,
I've been told I was brilliant,

27:51.513 --> 27:54.714
for a million
different reasons...

27:54.716 --> 27:57.483
but falling in love with you

27:57.485 --> 28:00.017
was the smartest thing
I ever did.

28:03.655 --> 28:06.422
I will always love you.

28:14.498 --> 28:16.564
(sniffles)

28:23.305 --> 28:24.470
Homeland Security!

28:24.472 --> 28:25.971
I need you to move
this van, now!

28:25.973 --> 28:27.906
I'm sorry, CDC has jurisdiction,

28:27.908 --> 28:30.375
and orders are: no one's in
or out until they get here.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.642
By then, it's too late!

28:31.644 --> 28:34.411
Now, I've got a cure here
that can save lives.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.578
Fungus was spotted
around an exit door.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.380
This facility has
to stay sealed.

28:38.382 --> 28:40.081
You can't pass.

28:45.421 --> 28:47.654
(line ringing)

28:47.656 --> 28:49.422
Walter, they're not
gonna let me in.

28:49.424 --> 28:52.024
You got any bright ideas
on how to deliver this thing?

28:52.026 --> 28:54.393
We have to distribute
from outside,

28:54.395 --> 28:56.728
but how do we do that
in a quarantined building?

28:56.730 --> 28:57.795
Oh.

28:57.797 --> 29:01.064
The standpipe is
the perfect access to it,

29:01.066 --> 29:02.698
but how do we get
the liquid mixture

29:02.700 --> 29:03.965
to all the infected floors?

29:04.934 --> 29:06.466
Boil it.

29:06.468 --> 29:07.834
Use the pipe
to distribute the vapor.

29:08.670 --> 29:10.069
Bad idea?

29:10.071 --> 29:11.703
No, that is brilliant!

29:11.705 --> 29:13.104
Happy?

29:13.105 --> 29:14.504
I think I may have
a way to pull this off.

29:14.507 --> 29:16.440
Okay, Doc, hold down the fort.
(woman groans)

29:16.442 --> 29:18.642
I know.
Just relax.

29:18.644 --> 29:20.343
I'm a Harvard-trained physician.
MAN: What field?

29:20.345 --> 29:21.677
You don't look like
you've done this before.

29:21.679 --> 29:23.478
Psychiatry.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.026
Okay, concept was to heat
the standpipe red hot

29:40.028 --> 29:41.827
using the gas line
from the kitchen.

29:41.829 --> 29:44.429
Yes. Enough heat, and then
when the mixture is poured in,

29:44.431 --> 29:45.930
it will vaporize
and then distribute

29:45.932 --> 29:47.364
throughout the hospital.

29:47.366 --> 29:48.431
Okay, the problem is,

29:48.433 --> 29:50.766
the standpipe and
the gas line...

29:50.768 --> 29:52.501
WALTER:
What's the problem?

29:52.503 --> 29:54.669
I will figure it out.

29:54.671 --> 29:57.004
Okay, I need your apron, please.

29:57.006 --> 29:58.138
Thank you.

30:06.581 --> 30:07.947
Lunch is served.

30:07.949 --> 30:09.815
Shut up.

30:09.817 --> 30:11.683
Happy, be careful.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.017
That kitchen is
ground zero.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.019
You touch the fungus,
you get sick instantly!

30:15.021 --> 30:16.787
Okay, either it works
or it doesn't.

30:16.789 --> 30:18.688
Otherwise,
we're just delaying fate.

30:19.657 --> 30:21.423
That woman is intense.

30:21.425 --> 30:23.825

I really hope this works.

30:58.926 --> 31:00.825
Walter, I can't leave
this room right now.

31:00.827 --> 31:03.127
I know. I know. But I can save
all the people in the hospital,

31:03.129 --> 31:04.495
including you and Mom.

31:04.497 --> 31:05.662
Now, I know that
you've never believed much

31:05.664 --> 31:07.147
in the things that I do,

31:07.148 --> 31:08.631
but I need you to believe now.
Please, Dad.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.698
I need your help.

31:14.136 --> 31:16.636
What do you need me to do?

31:17.572 --> 31:18.837
(P.A. beeps)

31:18.839 --> 31:20.839
Attention, everyone, please.

31:20.841 --> 31:24.509
To stop the spread of toxins,
you need to do the following.

31:24.511 --> 31:27.478
On each floor,
in various locations,

31:27.480 --> 31:28.979
are fire hoses.

31:28.981 --> 31:32.082
Get access to the hose
however you can.

31:32.084 --> 31:36.519
Unscrew the hose from the nozzle
and stand back.

31:36.521 --> 31:39.522
WALTER:<i> Pipe's heating,</i>
<i>but I still can't get to Megan.</i>

31:39.524 --> 31:40.756
You can figure out a way up.

31:40.758 --> 31:41.990
We can get to Megan.

31:41.992 --> 31:45.226
There's nothing
to hold onto except...

31:45.228 --> 31:46.694
except each other.

31:49.198 --> 31:52.165
Okay, so the shaft
is five feet wide.

31:52.167 --> 31:55.101
So we can climb up back-to-back,
legs braced against each other.

31:55.103 --> 31:58.704
And the-the wall pushes back,
exerting an equivalent force.

31:58.706 --> 32:01.106
Now, we have to move
at exactly the same speed,

32:01.108 --> 32:04.509
at exactly the same time,
or we fall three stories.

32:04.511 --> 32:06.244
Okay, so these are our backs.

32:06.246 --> 32:09.614
Press, keep pressing.

32:09.616 --> 32:11.882
Paige, y-you're not pressing.

32:11.884 --> 32:13.950
No, I'm praying.

32:13.952 --> 32:15.217
You're doing great, Anjali,
just great!

32:15.219 --> 32:18.019
Just keep pushing.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.720
You guys pick out
a name for the baby yet?

32:19.722 --> 32:20.854
Aashna!

32:20.856 --> 32:21.921
Oh, that's beautiful.

32:21.923 --> 32:23.889
Baby Aashna.

32:23.891 --> 32:26.124
Looks like our little princess
is crowning.

32:32.598 --> 32:34.564
What is it?

32:34.566 --> 32:36.065
The umbilical cord's
wrapped around the neck.

32:36.067 --> 32:38.133
Oh, my God.
I can fix it.

32:38.135 --> 32:40.201
I just need Happy.
She should've been back by now.

32:48.543 --> 32:50.676
Happy?

33:10.061 --> 33:11.427

and I can't help her.

never to say anything.

41:22.624 --> 41:24.957
He was always wrong
about math.

41:24.959 --> 41:27.492

was about to come down,
