00:35.380 --> 00:36.740
Monsieur Rahul!

00:37.980 --> 00:39.380
Il est la, mon sauveur.

00:39.380 --> 00:42.180
Bonjour.

00:42.180 --> 00:43.740
Merci, Monsieur.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.580
Merci du fond du coeur.

00:48.580 --> 00:49.980
Dieu vous benisse.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.340
Is Mr Okoye ready for the theatre?

01:07.020 --> 01:08.660
Morning. Morning.

01:08.660 --> 01:09.740
Morning.

01:12.180 --> 01:13.740
Morning. Morning.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.940
We're down to ten fentanyl. 200.

02:17.460 --> 02:18.860
What's he doing here?

02:22.180 --> 02:24.100
Have we sent?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.540
What's going on? Where's Mr Sayeed?

02:26.540 --> 02:28.020
Oh, a change in plan.

02:28.020 --> 02:30.060
I'm operating.

02:30.060 --> 02:31.700
I don't think so.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.100
Do you want to take it up
with the Medical Director?

02:53.180 --> 02:56.100
First case is a Hickman line.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.820
Mr Rahul?

04:00.820 --> 04:02.300
Take a message. I'll call them back.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.740
He says it's urgent.

04:11.660 --> 04:12.780
Mm.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.260
Yes, I got your little note.

04:18.340 --> 04:19.740
Stay where you are.

04:28.740 --> 04:32.020
Dan, get the on-call anaesthetist
to come and take over.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.580
I'm not having this.

05:13.340 --> 05:16.820
Silencium
by John Harles

05:53.380 --> 05:54.780
Go into the hospital and find out

05:54.780 --> 05:56.940
what we can and can't cordon off,
realistically.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.140
All right? Off you go.
Hey, Steve, you good?

06:01.620 --> 06:03.020
It's Adam.

06:04.820 --> 06:07.620
Dr Yuen? Forensic medical examiner.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.620
Oh, yeah. Yeah, all right.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.700
How you doing, Doc?

06:11.700 --> 06:14.660
Yeah, I heard you got the DI's job.
Congratulations.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.020
Are you taking the piss?

06:18.340 --> 06:19.740
Steve Galloway.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.060
Detective Sergeant.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.340
Jack Hodgson, forensics.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.940
Nikki Alexander, pathologist.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.100
Mm.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.460
Our victim is a Mr Arnie Rahul,

06:36.460 --> 06:39.340
consultant surgeon, 48 years old.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.980
And this place is?

06:42.980 --> 06:45.340
It's supposed to be
the new operating theatre,

06:45.340 --> 06:48.860
but they got the wiring spec all
wrong so they've got to redo it all.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.540
Our taxpayers' money at work.

06:53.620 --> 06:56.020
Blood staining on the clothes
suggests penetrating wound

06:56.020 --> 06:57.340
to the chest.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.740
Evidence of a struggle.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.220
No defensive wounds.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.340
Hands are clean.

07:24.380 --> 07:25.740
No abrasions.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.420
Bruising.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.700
He fell, face down,
and then moved.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.300
Or was moved.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.060
Smearing on the floor is
consistent with this.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.260
The assailant would have had
extensive cross-contamination

07:41.260 --> 07:42.740
with the victim's blood.

07:42.740 --> 07:43.820
I'll say.

07:43.820 --> 07:46.260
A lot of blood.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.220
Extensive spatter.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.580
Yeah. Looks like a frenzied attack.

07:51.580 --> 07:54.820
Could be from multiple sources.
We'll see.

07:54.820 --> 07:55.900
Right.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.060
All right.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.740
What's this?

08:13.620 --> 08:16.860
Smaller droplets of blood here.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.020
This is different.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.420
Hm. What if...

08:21.420 --> 08:24.140
..he took a swing
at his assailant...

08:24.140 --> 08:27.100
Mm-hm? ..hits him in the face,
gives him a bloody nose?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.860
The assailant bleeds...

08:32.740 --> 08:34.420
..continues to bleed.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.580
Huh.

08:40.580 --> 08:44.180
Maybe he wipes his nose
with his hand,

08:44.180 --> 08:46.100
leaves blood on the door handle

08:46.100 --> 08:47.340
on his way out?

08:47.340 --> 08:49.220
So not the victim's blood?

08:49.220 --> 08:50.940
I don't think so.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.300
Steve?

08:52.300 --> 08:53.380
Oh, look.

08:53.380 --> 08:54.980
Our new Detective Inspector.

08:56.540 --> 08:57.740
Guv.

08:59.420 --> 09:00.460
Hi.

09:00.460 --> 09:01.780
DI Ruth Cracknell.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.380
Hi.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.660
So the victim was about to start
an operation in theatre

09:06.660 --> 09:08.580
number 7, upstairs,

09:08.580 --> 09:10.660
gets a phone call, walks out,

09:10.660 --> 09:12.340
never comes back.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.540
And was that the last place
he was seen alive?

09:14.540 --> 09:17.540
Mm-hm. We should seal that off,
then, too.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.020
All yours, Steve.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.660
Right.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.260
February, March at the latest.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.740
A word.

09:29.740 --> 09:30.820
Emily.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.420
How nice to see you.

09:32.420 --> 09:35.780
Would you excuse us for a moment,
please?

09:35.780 --> 09:37.860
Is this anything to do with you?

09:39.460 --> 09:40.740
What are you talking about?

09:40.740 --> 09:44.460
My grant, from the
Cancer Research Council.

09:44.460 --> 09:47.020
Five years of research money, gone.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.100
I heard.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.500
Oh, you heard.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.860
Emily, what do you want?

09:54.860 --> 09:56.780
You sit on their advisory board.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.860
You can persuade them
to reverse the decision.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.180
That's the least you owe me.

10:00.180 --> 10:03.180
Your funding was suspended
because a key member of your team

10:03.180 --> 10:04.740
is a total liability.

10:04.740 --> 10:05.940
That is a lie.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.780
Then prove it, and maybe
they'll reconsider your grant.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.900
Don't worry. I will.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.140
So...

10:14.140 --> 10:16.860
..I hear they're floating
your little company.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.860
Going to make millions
from my research at St Jude's?

10:19.860 --> 10:22.140
Look, erm...

10:22.140 --> 10:24.820
..shouldn't you answer that?

10:24.820 --> 10:27.260
Listen, we don't have to be at war.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.940
Maybe the Cowley Institute can help.
How?

10:30.940 --> 10:34.180
Well, if you've got some
good projects ready to go,

10:34.180 --> 10:37.180
maybe our foundation could step in
with some funding.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.580
Oh, I get it.

10:38.580 --> 10:41.500
I show you all my data
and you steal that as well.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.100
Emily, Emily, Emily.

10:44.580 --> 10:47.580
Your original stem cell work
was brilliant.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.820
Brilliant.

10:48.820 --> 10:51.380
But for years you tried
and failed to turn it into

10:51.380 --> 10:53.100
a viable cancer treatment.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.380
We made that crucial step.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.740
That's all.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.340
Everyone knows Edison
didn't invent the light bulb.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.300
He just made it work.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.100
Edison was an arsehole.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.820
Professor, there's an urgent call
for Dr Braithwaite.

11:08.540 --> 11:09.980
CCTV, guv.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.540
There's a clip of him crossing the
corridor from the operating theatre.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.660
He's fully scrubbed - gloves, gown.

11:21.660 --> 11:23.060
What's that in his hand?

11:25.220 --> 11:26.900
Looks like a syringe and needle.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.940
Mm. A very big, long, sharp needle.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.100
You all right, Steve? Mm.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.900
Well, that could be
the murder weapon.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.580
And the gloves and gown
are all missing.

11:36.580 --> 11:38.740
Yeah, we're searching all the bins
in the vicinity.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.500
Good luck with that.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.540
Sorry?

11:41.540 --> 11:42.860
This is a hospital.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.700
It produces a ton of rubbish
every six hours.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.140
You think you're going to find

11:46.140 --> 11:47.860
a pair of bloodstained gloves in
that lot?

11:47.860 --> 11:50.660
What about the needle? You'd put
that in a sharps bin, wouldn't you?

11:50.660 --> 11:51.980
Same problem.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.900
There's a finite number of
sharps bins.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.060
And they are changed
less frequently.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.420
If we found it, we'd get DNA,
maybe prints.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.300
It might tell us
the assailant's movements.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.700
Steve, you heard the man.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.140
Bag up every sharps bin
in this hospital.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.060
What's the time?

12:32.060 --> 12:33.540
Mum, don't get anxious.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.740
I'm not standing for this.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.260
Right, I want interviews with
all the staff working with

12:51.260 --> 12:52.620
Arnie Rahul today.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.820
And identify and inform
the next of kin.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.100
Be discreet, yeah?

12:56.100 --> 12:57.580
Who's in charge here?

12:57.580 --> 12:59.260
Detective Inspector Cracknell.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.380
You are?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.060
Dr Braithwaite, Medical Director.

13:02.060 --> 13:05.420
I'm afraid you can't just shut down
an operating theatre.

13:05.420 --> 13:08.700
Unfortunately, it's now a
crime scene and a police matter.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.380
But we have patients needing
urgent treatment.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.140
I can get a warrant, Dr Braithwaite.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.660
Can I suggest something?

13:14.660 --> 13:17.060
Sorry. Nikki Alexander, pathologist.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.220
Ah, that we seal off
the theatre for...

13:19.220 --> 13:20.700
..what do you think, four hours?

13:20.700 --> 13:22.100
Yeah, that'd work.

13:23.140 --> 13:24.340
Very well.

13:24.340 --> 13:25.380
Four hours.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.780
Not a minute longer.

13:33.420 --> 13:34.540
Hey.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.980
Come on. Shift.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.020
Dr Braithwaite!

13:56.020 --> 13:57.900
Oh! Mum, you all right?

13:57.900 --> 13:59.620
Are you OK?

13:59.620 --> 14:01.500
We've been waiting an hour.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.460
Mrs Fletcher, I-I'm terribly sorry.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.780
Come this way.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.780
Can we get you a wheelchair, maybe?

14:10.780 --> 14:12.100
I'm not dead yet.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.060
Thanks.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.220
Pleasure.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.540
Rahul was scrubbed up,
ready to start the operation.

14:27.540 --> 14:28.980
It was a Hickman line.

14:31.020 --> 14:34.540
Dr Mitchell, we don't all share your
knowledge of medical procedures.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.500
It's a long-term vascular
access device

14:37.500 --> 14:40.940
for people who need chemotherapy
or blood transfusions or whatever.

14:40.940 --> 14:42.580
It's a minor procedure.

14:44.940 --> 14:47.100
And what happened then?

14:47.100 --> 14:48.660
Rahul got a phone call,

14:48.660 --> 14:50.500
and left.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.020
Just walked out.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.580
Is it true you two had
an argument before surgery?

14:57.580 --> 14:59.140
Nothing to speak of.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.980
But you said he shouldn't
be operating.

15:04.060 --> 15:07.140
Not after the Harry Fletcher
incident.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.180
Who's Harry Fletcher?

15:09.180 --> 15:10.540
A patient.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.460
Arrested on the table
during surgery last week.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.980
Currently dying on ICU.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.420
Trust investigation blamed
the anaesthetist.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.940
Do you disagree with
the investigation's findings?

15:25.780 --> 15:28.380
We don't believe the current
management has assessed

15:28.380 --> 15:31.180
Dr Rahul's performance
with sufficient...

15:31.180 --> 15:32.420
..objectivity.

15:37.220 --> 15:40.740
Arnie Rahul. Asian male.
Age, 48.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.340
Facial contusions.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.580
Bruising and abrasion of
the lower vermilion border.

15:57.580 --> 16:00.420
Consistent with blunt force trauma.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.780
Loose lower-left central incisor.

16:22.620 --> 16:25.340
Single puncture wound
to the left chest wall.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.420
Lateral to the sternum.

16:34.020 --> 16:36.260
Third interspace.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.900
CT shows multiple rib fractures.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.500
Rahul's phone, ID badge
and locker key.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.980
Great. You're going to check that
for texts and calls, right?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.060
Yeah, of course.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.620
Come here. There's something else
I want to show you.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.060
Right. This.

17:00.300 --> 17:05.180
This is a central line insertion
kit like the one Rahul had, OK?

17:05.180 --> 17:07.300
And it was all there

17:07.300 --> 17:08.940
in the theatre,

17:08.940 --> 17:12.380
except for the needle and syringe.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.180
You OK?

17:18.180 --> 17:19.340
Yeah, fine.

17:19.340 --> 17:20.740
You don't look fine.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.100
It's just, erm...

17:24.260 --> 17:25.540
..I don't like needles.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.620
Oh, mate.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.900
You are so on the wrong
investigation.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.380
It's not funny, all right?

17:34.380 --> 17:36.340
Long story short,

17:36.340 --> 17:37.860
we're looking for one of these.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.140
Oh...

17:41.260 --> 17:45.260
So Arnie Rahul died from a
puncture wound to the chest.

17:45.260 --> 17:49.220
The weapon caused penetrating
injuries to the ascending aorta,

17:49.220 --> 17:52.660
a three-centimetre tear to
the superior vena cava,

17:52.660 --> 17:54.700
and then the upper lobe
of the right lung,

17:54.700 --> 17:57.620
leading to extensive
hemopneumothorax.

17:57.620 --> 18:02.020
Injuries are consistent with
a central line insertion needle.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.220
If he just got stabbed
with a needle,

18:06.220 --> 18:08.100
how come there was so much blood?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.780
What is it, 18-gauge?

18:09.780 --> 18:11.820
Stick that into a big artery
and blood'll flow out

18:11.820 --> 18:13.620
like a high-pressure hose.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.340
He also had facial bruises...

18:18.260 --> 18:20.140
..and several broken ribs.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.580
So he took quite a beating?

18:21.580 --> 18:22.660
No.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.020
Chest compressions.

18:25.420 --> 18:28.140
Why would you kill someone
then try and revive them?

18:28.140 --> 18:29.620
There's something else.

18:29.620 --> 18:33.580
Blood alcohol level, three times
the legal driving limit.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.820
Share certificates.

19:08.820 --> 19:11.820
Talogen Biosciences.
You ever heard of them?

19:11.820 --> 19:13.940
No.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.220
Uh-oh.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.180
It's called vacuum metal deposition.

19:24.180 --> 19:26.660
Shows up fingerprints.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.100
How does it work, then?

19:29.100 --> 19:33.500
A tiny amount of gold, and then
zinc, are vaporised inside.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.180
The gold sticks to everything
except the fingerprint

19:36.180 --> 19:38.500
and the zinc sticks to
only the gold,

19:38.500 --> 19:40.820
so we get a reverse
image of the print.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.740
Five minutes on defrost?

19:52.740 --> 19:55.740
Right, two male DNA profiles
at the scene.

19:55.740 --> 19:58.260
One matches Rahul.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.740
The other is not on the database,

20:00.740 --> 20:03.380
and presumably belongs
to the attacker.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.420
This profile was found in spatter,

20:05.420 --> 20:08.260
roughly head-height
and on the door handle,

20:08.260 --> 20:12.660
which suggests the attacker
may have facial injuries.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.860
The fibre analysis is interesting.

20:15.860 --> 20:19.340
Its predominant population's
consistent with standard-issue

20:19.340 --> 20:20.660
surgical scrubs.

20:20.660 --> 20:23.460
So everyone in the room
was wearing scrubs?

20:23.460 --> 20:25.340
Looks like it.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.060
So a staff member?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.740
What would he do with the scrubs?

20:28.740 --> 20:31.300
They'd go to the laundry
with a million others.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.900
Right, Steve, you need to tell
the hospital to hold on to

20:33.900 --> 20:36.180
any used scrubs.

20:36.180 --> 20:38.220
What do we know about Rahul?

20:38.220 --> 20:40.060
Erm, general surgeon,

20:40.060 --> 20:42.300
worked at St Jude's for ten years.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.460
Good reputation,

20:43.460 --> 20:45.700
although he's fallen out
with a few people recently.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.020
Surgeons, eh?

20:49.740 --> 20:51.100
Erm, divorced,

20:51.100 --> 20:52.500
financial difficulties.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.820
We did find something interesting
in his locker.

20:54.820 --> 20:59.100
A share certificate for
a company called Talogen.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.940
Talogen? Yeah.

21:00.940 --> 21:03.900
That's a spin-out from the
Cowley Institute of Oncology.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.940
Professor Adrian Cowley.

21:05.940 --> 21:07.860
World expert in gene editing.

21:11.060 --> 21:14.300
So Rahul is drinking, he's not
getting on with his colleagues.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.900
He gets a threatening note,
then he gets a phone call.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.580
Well, yeah, what do we know
about that?

21:18.580 --> 21:19.900
Ah, male voice. Unidentified.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.100
Then he leaves theatre,
feels the need to...

21:22.100 --> 21:24.060
..pick up a weapon on the way,

21:24.060 --> 21:27.380
gets into a fight,
ends up stabbed.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.740
Here we go.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.700
Linda Fletcher.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.300
Arrested for criminal damage
in 1989.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.020
Pre-'95, so no DNA on file.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.140
Well, you said the DNA at the scene
was male. Yeah.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.540
Accomplice, then?

21:58.900 --> 22:00.060
Fletcher.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.300
Harry Fletcher was Rahul's patient.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.740
He had a cardiac arrest
during an operation.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.540
He's still on intensive care.

22:08.540 --> 22:12.380
Dr Mitchell claimed Rahul
botched the surgery,

22:12.380 --> 22:14.740
but the hospital blamed
the anaesthetist.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.660
Adam?

23:16.660 --> 23:17.820
Jack, hi.

23:17.820 --> 23:19.100
Where'd you get to?

23:19.100 --> 23:21.380
Well, I had to nip home to
sort something out.

23:21.380 --> 23:22.700
I won't be long.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.260
Oh, OK.

23:24.260 --> 23:26.100
Give me a shout when you get back,
eh?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.260
Will do.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.740
 Guv.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.140
Linda Fletcher?

23:46.140 --> 23:48.380
I'm Detective Inspector
Ruth Cracknell.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.540
Linda, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

23:50.540 --> 23:51.940
of Arnie Rahul. What?

23:51.940 --> 23:53.060
What are you doing?

23:53.060 --> 23:55.580
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

23:55.580 --> 23:58.220
Mum? ..if you do not mention when
questioned... Right, take it easy.

23:58.220 --> 24:00.940
..something you later rely on
in court. Anything you do say will

24:00.940 --> 24:02.340
be given in evidence.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.100
She's 70 years old.
She's just got cancer.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.700
How could she murder anyone?
Where were you between the hours of

24:06.700 --> 24:09.100
8:30 and 9:30 this morning? Mum!
Look, they just turned off

24:09.100 --> 24:12.020
my dad's life support. Take it easy.
Leave me alone. Look, take it easy!

24:12.020 --> 24:15.100
Mum! One more step
and you will be arrested.

24:26.940 --> 24:28.980
You know, I shouldn't be
talking to you.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.020
But it's been such a long time.

24:39.340 --> 24:42.140
So...forensic pathology.

24:42.140 --> 24:43.980
How did that happen?

24:43.980 --> 24:46.020
It's an endlessly fascinating field.

24:49.860 --> 24:52.260
Do you get back to Singapore much?

24:54.020 --> 24:55.620
Maybe once a year.

24:55.620 --> 24:59.980
Do you know they asked me to be
examiner at your old medical school?

24:59.980 --> 25:01.620
That was a trip down memory lane.

25:02.740 --> 25:04.420
It's all changed, of course.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.260
Since your father and I
ran the lab there together.

25:08.220 --> 25:11.140
Adam, I have a favour to ask you.

25:11.140 --> 25:14.140
It's a sensitive matter.

25:14.140 --> 25:18.100
One of our patient's life support
has been turned off today.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.980
Harry Fletcher.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.380
I want you to do the postmortem.

25:23.540 --> 25:26.260
The surgeon in that case
was Arnie Rahul, wasn't it?

25:26.260 --> 25:27.580
Yes.

25:27.580 --> 25:30.220
Technically, that would be
a conflict of interest.

25:30.220 --> 25:33.140
I need someone I can trust.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.540
He was a good man.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.940
Yeah, sure. Why not?

25:39.940 --> 25:41.060
Excellent.

25:42.300 --> 25:45.700
In return, you have to tell me
something about Rahul. Hm.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.060
Did you know he had shares
in Talogen Biosciences?

25:51.060 --> 25:52.420
Cowley.

25:52.420 --> 25:56.060
It's not enough that
he stole all my research,

25:56.060 --> 25:58.260
he's trying to poach all my staff.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.260
Can you open your mouth?

26:33.580 --> 26:34.940
All done.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.740
You know, my mum, she, erm...

26:40.740 --> 26:42.020
She hated that surgeon,

26:42.020 --> 26:45.100
but there's no way she could...

26:45.100 --> 26:47.460
I'm really sorry about your dad.

26:49.860 --> 26:53.740
Yeah. He only came in for
a routine operation.

26:53.740 --> 26:58.620
You know Rahul, he came in after
and he said that there'd been

26:58.620 --> 27:00.740
some problem with the anaesthetic.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.860
And then this anaesthetist,
she comes in,

27:03.860 --> 27:05.860
and she's sat with Mum
for ages, saying,

27:05.860 --> 27:10.580
"Oh, how sorry I am because
I didn't spot Dad's heart disease."

27:10.580 --> 27:11.980
But that's bullshit.

27:11.980 --> 27:14.860
That is bullshit because
Dad didn't have any heart disease.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.500
 Don't
tell me you've changed your mind.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.780
No, but just to be clear,

27:31.780 --> 27:34.260
we can't have any contact
while this is going on.

27:34.260 --> 27:35.340
Don't worry.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.740
Discretion is my middle name.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.940
Just let me know what you
find at the postmortem.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.380
No, I can't do that.

27:41.380 --> 27:43.140
I report directly to the Coroner.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.700
Emily?

27:48.780 --> 27:49.980
Emily?

28:00.340 --> 28:01.660
Where do you want them?

28:01.660 --> 28:03.020
Oh, right. In the back, please.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.420
OK. Come on.

28:05.740 --> 28:07.100
Through the back.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.420
Crikey.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.300
I knew there'd be a lot,
but this is...

28:13.300 --> 28:15.580
Yeah, there's another three
vanloads out there. What?

28:15.580 --> 28:16.980
Right, I've got to go.

28:16.980 --> 28:18.980
We're going to pay this
Cowley bloke a visit,

28:18.980 --> 28:20.660
see what these shares are all about.

28:20.660 --> 28:21.740
Good luck with all that.

28:24.220 --> 28:25.340
Where's Adam?

28:25.340 --> 28:26.740
Not been in.

28:26.740 --> 28:27.940
Want to give me a hand?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.340
I don't like needles.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.060
Ah, more.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.380
Yes, this way.

28:35.740 --> 28:37.220
That's excellent.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.500
Professor Cowley?

28:42.500 --> 28:44.700
Ah, two seconds.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.300
Thanks. The advisory committee's
at ten.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.820
Thanks, Jenny.

28:48.820 --> 28:52.540
So... Dr Yuen, I can give you
15 minutes.

28:52.540 --> 28:53.780
I don't want to interrupt.

28:53.780 --> 28:55.900
Oh, not at all. This way.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.340
Of course, we've met before,
haven't we?

29:08.340 --> 29:10.300
You gave that fascinating
presentation on

29:10.300 --> 29:11.940
single-cell RNA sequencing.

29:14.300 --> 29:15.420
Well remembered.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.380
What can I do for you?

29:17.380 --> 29:19.980
There was an incident
yesterday at St Jude's.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.020
Oh?

29:21.020 --> 29:23.020
Do you know Arnie Rahul?

29:23.020 --> 29:24.700
Well, I know of him.

29:24.700 --> 29:27.660
I don't think we've ever met.

29:27.660 --> 29:29.300
He's a Braithwaite acolyte.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.660
Controversial fellow.

29:30.660 --> 29:31.980
What's he done now?

29:31.980 --> 29:33.620
He was murdered.

29:33.620 --> 29:36.020
Attacked as he was about
to start an operation.

29:36.020 --> 29:37.660
My goodness.

29:37.660 --> 29:41.620
Did you know he owns shares
in Talogen Biosciences?

29:41.620 --> 29:43.300
Are you sure?

29:43.300 --> 29:44.660
It's your company.

29:44.660 --> 29:45.700
Actually...

29:47.500 --> 29:48.700
..it isn't.

29:48.700 --> 29:52.340
My interest was placed in
a charitable trust years ago.

29:52.340 --> 29:55.140
Talogen helps to keep
this place going,

29:55.140 --> 29:57.500
but beyond that
I'm out of the loop.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.700
Well, you're right.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.940
Mm.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.700
Yes.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.060
Here he is.

30:06.060 --> 30:08.900
Acquired as a new share issue,
along with several other names.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.380
Scientists, mainly.

30:10.380 --> 30:11.700
How did you acquire them?

30:11.700 --> 30:13.700
Oh, consultancy fees, I expect.

30:13.700 --> 30:16.860
No, these people have all done
work for the company in exchange

30:16.860 --> 30:19.260
for equity rather than cash.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.300
It's quite common with spin-outs.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.180
Do you think that's what
got him killed?

30:24.180 --> 30:25.380
What do you mean?

30:25.380 --> 30:28.060
Talogen's going to be floated
in a matter of weeks.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.420
That stock will be worth a fortune.

30:31.900 --> 30:34.180
Who knows what he'd got
himself into.

30:36.540 --> 30:38.700
Well, thank you for your time.

30:38.700 --> 30:39.900
Not at all.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.580
And do keep in touch.

30:42.780 --> 30:45.260
A bright lad like you should
keep his options open.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.340
Professor.

30:52.740 --> 30:55.740
Interviewing witnesses?
Who does the man think he is?!

30:55.740 --> 30:57.260
Yes, it was inappropriate.

30:57.260 --> 30:59.980
It makes me look like I don't have
control of my own investigation!

30:59.980 --> 31:01.860
Well, it won't happen again.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.300
She's right.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.540
Sorry.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.020
I just thought, I know him a bit.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.260
I thought it would be a good
contact to follow up on.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.580
Just be aware whose toes
you're treading on, yeah?

31:27.940 --> 31:29.540
So...

31:29.540 --> 31:32.180
..Linda Fletcher has admitted
to writing the note,

31:32.180 --> 31:36.580
but she denies any involvement
in the death of Arnie Rahul.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.820
What have you got for me?

31:37.820 --> 31:41.380
Neither Linda nor Jed Fletcher are
a match to the DNA at the scene.

31:41.380 --> 31:43.700
And, as we know from
the fibre analysis,

31:43.700 --> 31:45.580
they would've had to be
wearing scrubs.

31:45.580 --> 31:48.420
Yeah, well, couldn't they have got
them from the linen cupboard?

31:48.420 --> 31:51.020
Ah, no. Scrubs are issued
by a vending machine

31:51.020 --> 31:52.180
inside the changing rooms.

31:52.180 --> 31:54.340
You need a staff ID to get them.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.860
So we'll be releasing
Linda Fletcher, then.

31:59.020 --> 32:00.300
What about the patient?

32:00.300 --> 32:02.180
The guy Rahul was going
to operate on,

32:02.180 --> 32:03.340
have we spoken to him?

32:03.340 --> 32:04.700
Yeah. Ah...

32:04.700 --> 32:07.420
Mr... Yeah, Wilfred Okoye.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.620
Beninese national.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.900
He's still in the hospital.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.020
What's he going to know?

32:11.020 --> 32:13.300
You won't find out unless
you ask him.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.300
Mr Wilfred Okoye?
Ah, oui.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.780
I'm Detective Sergeant
Steve Galloway.

32:22.780 --> 32:24.180
Can I ask you a few questions?

32:24.180 --> 32:27.460
I'm afraid Mr Okoye speaks
very little English.

32:28.420 --> 32:30.820
Oh. Erm, sorry.
And you are?

32:30.820 --> 32:32.660
I am Reverend Kanu.

32:32.660 --> 32:36.740
My church runs a charity that helps
people like Mr Okoye get

32:36.740 --> 32:39.740
treatments that would
otherwise not be available.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.900
Oh. I can translate if you wish?

32:43.140 --> 32:44.740
That would be great. Thank you.

32:47.260 --> 32:50.660
Mr Okoye, you're from Benin.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.140
Vous etes Beninois?

32:52.140 --> 32:53.340
Oui.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.980
J'ai une maladie du sang.

32:54.980 --> 32:56.980
Elle est tres courante
dans ma region.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.500
Yes, I have a blood disorder.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.580
It is common in my region.

33:00.580 --> 33:03.500
And how long have you known
Mr Rahul?

33:03.500 --> 33:06.860
Depuis combien de temps vous
connaissez Monsieur Rahul?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.740
Depuis une semaine.

33:08.740 --> 33:10.180
Just a week.

33:12.060 --> 33:14.060
And, erm...

33:14.060 --> 33:16.180
Ah...

33:16.180 --> 33:19.540
Did you notice anything strange
about him?

33:19.540 --> 33:23.100
Avez-vous remarque quelque chose
de bizarre chez lui?

33:23.100 --> 33:24.460
Non.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.580
C'etait un homme tellement gentil.

33:26.580 --> 33:29.060
Pourquoi devrait-on voir
lui faire du mal?

33:29.060 --> 33:31.220
No, he was such a kind man.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.700
Why should anyone wish to hurt him?

33:33.700 --> 33:35.020
Hm.

33:38.220 --> 33:39.460
Vous allez bien, Monsieur?

33:39.460 --> 33:40.780
Are you feeling OK?

33:40.780 --> 33:42.500
Yes. Ah, sorry. I've just got a...

33:42.500 --> 33:44.140
A little headache. Erm, sorry.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.940
Erm... Merci, Mr Okoye.

33:51.380 --> 33:55.020
Would it be possible to take
a swab of your mouth for DNA?

33:55.020 --> 33:56.980
It's just for elimination purposes.

33:56.980 --> 33:59.700
Serait-il possible de faire
un prelevement dans votre bouche

33:59.700 --> 34:00.900
pour de l'ADN?

34:00.900 --> 34:02.940
C'est juste a des fins
d'elimination.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.140
Ah, oui.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.220
Allez-y.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.180
Oh, don't worry.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.780
He'll be fine.

34:18.300 --> 34:21.140
Nikki, Harry Fletcher died
yesterday.

34:21.140 --> 34:23.580
Yes. I was just been speaking
to the Coroner, and given

34:23.580 --> 34:26.740
the crossover, I persuaded her
that his PM should be done here.

34:26.740 --> 34:27.940
Do you agree?

34:27.940 --> 34:30.220
Definitely. I'll do it.

34:30.220 --> 34:32.100
I was going to ask if I could do it.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.700
Erm...

34:35.700 --> 34:37.660
No, I'm going to pull rank,
I'm afraid.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.540
There's something strange
about all this.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.740
I'm not exactly overworked
at the moment.

34:42.860 --> 34:44.140
OK.

34:44.140 --> 34:45.660
If you feel that way.

34:45.660 --> 34:48.380
But we'll need to discuss
your findings straight away, yeah?

34:48.380 --> 34:49.500
Of course.

35:01.660 --> 35:04.820
Summarising postmortem examination,
Harry Fletcher.

35:04.820 --> 35:07.140
Brain shows significant swelling,

35:07.140 --> 35:09.660
flattened surface undulations.

35:09.660 --> 35:13.500
The heart has a slightly
increased weight at 400g.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.900
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.820
No valve abnormalities.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.780
Coronary arteries free of atheroma.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.860
No coronary or pulmonary thrombosis.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.140
Yet preoperative ECG is
grossly abnormal.

35:41.620 --> 35:42.660
Seen Nikki?

35:42.660 --> 35:43.740
She's gone for the day.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.860
She has some class or other
on Friday nights.

35:45.860 --> 35:46.900
Class?

35:46.900 --> 35:48.740
I don't know. Pilates or something.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.020
Give her a ring.

35:55.860 --> 35:57.220
Hey, Nikki.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.780
Hope I'm not interrupting.

36:00.220 --> 36:02.220
Harry Fletcher's autopsy...

36:04.900 --> 36:06.220
Ah, where?

36:29.540 --> 36:31.700
Hey, Jackie.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.060
Hi.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.700
Volunteering?

36:34.700 --> 36:36.260
Jack thinks you're at pilates.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.100
Oh. There you go.

36:42.380 --> 36:45.500
So Harry Fletcher was admitted
for a routine gall bladder op.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.180
Immediate cause of death is
hypoxic brain injury

36:48.180 --> 36:49.900
caused by cardiac arrest.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.900
The heart is surprisingly healthy.

36:51.900 --> 36:55.740
However, very abnormal
preoperative ECG.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.380
How do you square that?

36:57.380 --> 36:59.900
On microscopic examination,
there is a small area

36:59.900 --> 37:01.620
of inflammation in the heart muscle.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.700
Myocarditis?

37:02.700 --> 37:03.740
Mm.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.180
Did you find it anywhere else?

37:05.180 --> 37:06.460
No, just one small area.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.460
What about the abdomen?

37:10.460 --> 37:13.100
Gallstones, small superficial
haemorrhage on the surface of

37:13.100 --> 37:15.340
the liver, otherwise unremarkable.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.740
So what instruments had
they used in the operation?

37:17.740 --> 37:20.940
A Veress needle, to fill
the abdomen with gas.

37:20.940 --> 37:23.300
Could that have caused
the lesion on the liver?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.740
Mm... And what if gas was
pumped into the liver?

37:25.740 --> 37:28.500
It would circulate to the heart
and cause cardiac arrest.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.580
The operation notes stated that
the surgery hadn't started.

37:31.580 --> 37:35.180
Anyway, there were no gas bubbles in
the heart or pulmonary circulation.

37:35.180 --> 37:37.380
Well, he lived for a week
afterwards.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.540
It would've all be reabsorbed
in that time.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.740
So how do you explain the ECG?

37:41.740 --> 37:43.780
I can't.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.420
Which makes me suspicious.

37:46.420 --> 37:48.620
You think somebody switched
the ECG?

37:48.620 --> 37:51.020
Seriously?

37:51.020 --> 37:53.220
What about Dr Braithwaite?

37:53.220 --> 37:54.740
No, she wouldn't do that.

37:57.660 --> 37:59.860
I mean, someone in her position
would have nothing

37:59.860 --> 38:01.540
to gain from that.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.540
OK.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.380
Well, why don't you sleep on it?

38:05.380 --> 38:07.340
Right.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.100
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.340
See you tomorrow.

38:20.660 --> 38:23.140
Ah. I wasn't expecting to
see you again today.

38:23.140 --> 38:25.060
Oh, I just came to collect these.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.860
Ready for a morning in church
with screaming babies tomorrow?

38:28.860 --> 38:30.020
Oh...

38:30.020 --> 38:31.420
Do we have to go?

38:31.420 --> 38:32.740
Yes, we do.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.100
But you said you didn't want to go.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.900
Why are you so keen all of a sudden?

38:37.900 --> 38:40.540
Because our colleague invited us.

38:40.540 --> 38:42.500
And I love seeing you
all dressed up.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.700
I have to dress up?

38:43.700 --> 38:44.940
Do I have to wear a tie?

38:44.940 --> 38:46.620
Wait, what's christening etiquette?

38:46.620 --> 38:48.140
Do we have to bring something?

39:05.460 --> 39:06.700
Here she is.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.220
Hello!

39:09.220 --> 39:11.220
Hello, you.

39:11.220 --> 39:13.180
Hello.

39:13.180 --> 39:14.660
Thanks for the gift.

39:14.660 --> 39:16.580
Oh, I'm so glad you liked it.

39:16.580 --> 39:18.700
Why don't you guys step inside
to the party?

39:18.700 --> 39:20.140
I'm going to put her down for a nap,

39:20.140 --> 39:21.700
and I'll come and see you in a sec.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.780
OK.

39:22.780 --> 39:23.820
Bye.

39:27.420 --> 39:29.780
"I'm so glad you liked it!"

39:29.780 --> 39:31.540
You don't even know what it was.

39:31.540 --> 39:32.660
What was it?

39:32.660 --> 39:35.620
One of those little mobile
things that hang over the cot.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.700
Little wooden stars. You'd love it.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.420
Mm. Are you actually good at this?

39:39.420 --> 39:41.380
Oh...

39:41.380 --> 39:42.740
Ah.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.700
Gunshot wound to the chest!

39:45.700 --> 39:48.100
Ohhh!

39:48.100 --> 39:50.740
That will never come out.

39:51.940 --> 39:54.300
Maybe you could chuck it in
the hospital laundry.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.820
Here. I'll get you another.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.340
Marie.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.820
Emily!

40:05.820 --> 40:06.940
I can't stay long.

40:06.940 --> 40:09.380
I just wanted to mark
the happy occasion.

40:09.380 --> 40:10.460
Adam.

40:12.380 --> 40:14.660
Hi. Darling, why don't you
go inside?

40:14.660 --> 40:16.500
I'll catch up with you in a sec. OK.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.700
What are you doing?
My colleagues are here.

40:21.700 --> 40:22.820
Don't worry.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.340
But we need to talk.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.620
About Harry Fletcher.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.100
I can't discuss that with you.
You know that.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.340
There's more at stake
than you think.

40:31.340 --> 40:34.300
All our research,
our life-saving research,

40:34.300 --> 40:36.140
depends on clearing Arnie's name.

40:36.140 --> 40:40.500
Our grant was suspended because
of the smears against Arnie.

40:40.500 --> 40:44.340
I can get it back if I can prove
he was wrongly accused.

40:45.700 --> 40:46.740
No.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.340
Do you want everyone to know...

40:49.780 --> 40:51.100
..what I know?

40:56.020 --> 40:58.460
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:04.740 --> 41:06.900
Hi.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.380
Is that Emily Braithwaite?

41:09.380 --> 41:11.500
Yes. She's Adam's godmother.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.140
Excuse me.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.740
You'd think he might have
mentioned it.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.220
Mm-hm. It is a bit odd.

41:28.220 --> 41:29.500
It's more than a bit odd.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.460
It's a direct conflict of interest.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.860
No wonder he was so keen
to do Fletcher's PM.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.820
Are you going to confront him?

41:41.660 --> 41:42.700
Not yet.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.140
Can I be there when you do?

42:02.260 --> 42:03.500
Hi.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.100
Any news on the murder weapon?

42:23.100 --> 42:25.980
Erm, we're about a third of the way
through the sharps bins.

42:25.980 --> 42:28.980
Any central line needles
we find are tested for DNA,

42:28.980 --> 42:31.220
but no matches so far.

42:31.220 --> 42:33.060
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

42:33.060 --> 42:35.260
But I've had an idea.

42:35.260 --> 42:38.980
So we know Rahul's killer had on
some pretty bloodstained scrubs, OK?

42:38.980 --> 42:43.020
We also assume that they were
disposed of in the hospital system.

42:43.020 --> 42:44.220
So...

42:47.100 --> 42:49.740
You take scrubs from one machine
with your ID badge,

42:49.740 --> 42:52.380
and then when you've finished
you put them back in this machine

42:52.380 --> 42:53.900
and your account is credited again.

42:53.900 --> 42:58.420
Now, this machine takes
a photo of what you deposit,

42:58.420 --> 43:00.660
to make sure you actually
put them back.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.820
So?

43:01.820 --> 43:04.300
Well, if we found the scrubs
themselves we might get some DNA,

43:04.300 --> 43:06.060
but we've already got
the killer's DNA.

43:06.060 --> 43:07.540
Yeah. And 8,000 suspects.

43:07.540 --> 43:11.340
Yes. So I'm saying we look
at the photos instead,

43:11.340 --> 43:13.780
find the ones that are heavily
bloodstained,

43:13.780 --> 43:17.260
and hopefully, hopefully,
we get a staff ID.

43:17.260 --> 43:18.860
Great idea, Jack.

43:20.020 --> 43:22.060
Off you go Steve.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.900
Come on Steve. Let's do this.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.540
Oh, and we had a chat
to Dr Benning.

43:28.540 --> 43:30.140
The anaesthetist who got suspended.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.660
Oh, yeah. What did she have to say?

43:31.660 --> 43:32.780
Well, nothing useful.

43:32.780 --> 43:34.380
She seems pretty messed up.

43:34.380 --> 43:36.940
But she has asked
if she could see Rahul.

43:36.940 --> 43:38.300
You OK with it?

43:38.300 --> 43:40.020
Yeah. All right. I'll set it up.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.340
Great.

43:56.260 --> 43:57.580
Dr Benning?

43:57.580 --> 43:59.260
Nikki Alexander.

43:59.260 --> 44:01.140
Dr Mitchell. Hi.

44:01.140 --> 44:02.500
Are you sure you want to do this?

44:02.500 --> 44:03.620
Yeah.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.900
If you'd like to come this way?

44:42.700 --> 44:44.340
Would you give us a minute?

44:45.980 --> 44:47.820
No, I think I should... I'm fine.

45:10.220 --> 45:12.500
Had you worked with Mr Rahul
for long?

45:15.500 --> 45:17.260
We were going to move in together.

45:19.100 --> 45:20.740
You were in a relationship?

45:23.180 --> 45:26.140
Well, he broke up with me
after the Fletcher incident.

45:29.460 --> 45:32.340
That was the last time
I...heard his voice.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.460
He was ill.

45:38.940 --> 45:42.660
He was falling out with everybody
but that wasn't really him.

45:44.260 --> 45:46.980
He was kind, he was caring,

45:46.980 --> 45:48.700
he was funny.

45:50.980 --> 45:53.460
He was brilliant,
brilliant at his job.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.420
But everything he'd worked for
was slipping away.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.300
Can I ask you...

46:05.220 --> 46:07.340
..what do you think happened
to Mr Fletcher?

46:08.620 --> 46:10.220
How should I know?

46:11.260 --> 46:15.060
Nothing about that day
makes sense in my mind.

46:17.180 --> 46:21.460
I thought I'd looked at his ECG,
but apparently I didn't.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.780
And I thought the surgery
had started when he arrested,

46:25.780 --> 46:28.460
but it hadn't. Wait -
why did you think that?

46:28.460 --> 46:29.580
Well, I remem...

46:32.180 --> 46:35.900
I thought I remembered Arnie
saying, "Gas on."

46:37.540 --> 46:41.420
Meaning he'd turned on the gas
used to inflate the abdomen?

46:41.420 --> 46:42.500
Yeah.

46:44.020 --> 46:48.540
But afterwards, Arnie looked me
in the eye and he said that

46:48.540 --> 46:49.900
that couldn't be true.

46:52.460 --> 46:54.260
So I don't know what to believe.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.620
How was that?

47:17.620 --> 47:19.940
Benning was in a relationship
with Arnie Rahul.

47:19.940 --> 47:20.980
What?

47:20.980 --> 47:22.980
He called it off
after the operation.

47:22.980 --> 47:25.500
Interesting body language
with Mitchell too.

47:25.500 --> 47:27.780
A love triangle?

47:27.780 --> 47:31.020
So Rahul shags the girl you're
in love with, then dumps her

47:31.020 --> 47:32.540
and gets her suspended.

47:32.540 --> 47:34.060
Yeah, that'd make you pretty angry.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.100
Mm-hm.

47:35.100 --> 47:37.700
Or Mitchell is making groundless
accusations of incompetence

47:37.700 --> 47:38.820
out of jealousy.

47:38.820 --> 47:41.740
According to Dr Benning, the gas
used to inflate the abdomen

47:41.740 --> 47:43.540
was turned on before
Fletcher collapsed.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.140
She has every incentive to say that,

47:45.140 --> 47:46.660
especially if she messed up.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.380
I think Fletcher died as
a result of Rahul's negligence

47:52.380 --> 47:54.420
and someone is covering it up.

47:54.420 --> 47:55.860
I doubt it.

47:57.020 --> 47:58.140
Occam's razor.

47:58.140 --> 48:00.740
The simplest explanation
is usually correct.

48:19.300 --> 48:21.380
So Adam's sticking to his guns.

48:22.940 --> 48:24.500
What are you up to?

48:24.500 --> 48:26.500
Looking at photos of dirty laundry.

48:29.260 --> 48:32.100
If he says what I think
he's going to say,

48:32.100 --> 48:33.940
then I'll have to tell the Coroner.

48:36.300 --> 48:38.500
You sure you want to do that?

48:38.500 --> 48:40.460
What, so everything's OK
if he agrees with you,

48:40.460 --> 48:42.300
but if he contradicts you
that's a problem?

48:42.300 --> 48:43.580
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

48:43.580 --> 48:45.140
Come on, you know me
better than that.

48:45.140 --> 48:47.220
Maybe Adam should've told us
about Braithwaite,

48:47.220 --> 48:49.300
but it doesn't automatically
mean he's corrupt.

48:49.300 --> 48:50.940
Then why all the secrecy?

48:50.940 --> 48:52.420
Secrecy or privacy?

49:08.700 --> 49:09.940
Hello.

49:11.020 --> 49:15.740
What is a hospital cleaner doing
with heavily bloodstained scrubs?

49:39.780 --> 49:41.420
Simi Jacobs?

49:51.420 --> 49:53.140
Bit of a guilty conscience?

50:45.100 --> 50:46.540
Hey.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.940
So they made an arrest.

50:49.940 --> 50:51.660
I just examined him at the station.

50:51.660 --> 50:53.340
Got some DNA for you.

50:53.340 --> 50:55.460
He's got a bruise over his eye,
and get this -

50:55.460 --> 50:56.940
he has a puncture wound to the neck.

50:56.940 --> 50:57.980
Really?

50:57.980 --> 51:00.460
Bang to rights, I'd say,
and all down to your insane idea

51:00.460 --> 51:01.660
about the scrubs.

51:01.660 --> 51:02.940
Brilliant work.

51:02.940 --> 51:04.500
Sorry, was...

51:04.500 --> 51:05.900
Was that a compliment?

51:11.180 --> 51:13.180
Adam?

51:13.180 --> 51:14.980
You all set for Fletcher's inquest?

51:14.980 --> 51:16.340
Yes, I've written his report.

51:16.340 --> 51:17.500
Do you want to see it?

51:17.500 --> 51:19.420
No. I can trust you, can't I?

51:22.540 --> 51:24.900
The Fletcher family have been
through enough.

51:25.900 --> 51:28.380
They're looking forward
to getting the truth.

51:36.180 --> 51:39.180
Dr Yuen, have you reached
a conclusion

51:39.180 --> 51:41.020
regarding the cause of death?

51:41.980 --> 51:44.980
The postmortem examination
confirmed that Mr Fletcher died

51:44.980 --> 51:47.100
as a result of hypoxic brain injury.

51:47.100 --> 51:50.060
This is consistent with a prolonged
period of circulatory arrest

51:50.060 --> 51:52.820
that occurred during
an aborted surgical procedure

51:52.820 --> 51:54.820
on 5th August, 2021.

51:54.820 --> 51:58.580
You have just heard the trust
internal report, which suggests

51:58.580 --> 52:02.620
that Mr Fletcher had pre-existing
cardiac disease.

52:02.620 --> 52:05.780
Have you formed a view on
the cause of the cardiac arrest

52:05.780 --> 52:07.300
during surgery?

52:07.300 --> 52:08.460
Yes, ma'am.

52:14.860 --> 52:16.540
Please, go on.

52:21.780 --> 52:24.860
There was no significant
cardiac disease.

52:24.860 --> 52:27.900
There was, however, a puncture wound
to the liver consistent with

52:27.900 --> 52:31.300
the insertion of the Veress
laparoscopic insufflation needle

52:31.300 --> 52:34.500
that records show was used
during the procedure.

52:34.500 --> 52:38.700
It's my opinion that this needle was
inserted mistakenly into the liver,

52:38.700 --> 52:40.900
and pressurised gas was
injected through it.

52:42.100 --> 52:44.780
This gas entered
the venous circulation

52:44.780 --> 52:47.700
and travelled to the heart,
causing cardiac arrest.

52:47.700 --> 52:51.300
So how do you explain
the abnormal ECG?

52:51.300 --> 52:52.900
That's a matter for a clinician.

52:52.900 --> 52:55.700
But Mr Fletcher died because
of surgical error.

53:00.700 --> 53:02.260
Adam!

53:03.740 --> 53:05.380
What the hell was that?

53:05.380 --> 53:06.900
The truth.

53:06.900 --> 53:09.180
Arnie was not incompetent.

53:09.180 --> 53:11.540
What does it matter? He's dead.

53:11.540 --> 53:14.300
You have no idea what you've done.

53:14.300 --> 53:15.860
This isn't over.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.260
Well, you know what?

53:17.260 --> 53:19.340
I don't respond very well
to threats.

53:19.340 --> 53:21.140
It's not a threat.

53:33.020 --> 53:35.340
Looks like you had nothing
to worry about.

53:37.100 --> 53:39.500
So Simi Jacobs.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.100
Worked at St Jude's for two years.

53:41.100 --> 53:43.100
He's denying everything.

53:43.100 --> 53:46.020
Denies knowing Rahul, denies being
anywhere near the new theatres

53:46.020 --> 53:47.380
at the time of the murder.

53:47.380 --> 53:51.740
Says the bloodstains on his scrubs
were from a rubbish bag that split.

53:51.740 --> 53:54.060
Ha. How long till we get DNA back?

53:54.060 --> 53:55.380
Any minute now.

53:55.380 --> 53:58.300
Well, he has injuries consistent
with blunt force trauma to the face

53:58.300 --> 53:59.700
and a puncture wound to the neck.

53:59.700 --> 54:01.540
Yeah, it all fits. Aha.

54:01.540 --> 54:03.100
Hot off the press. Thank you.

54:04.460 --> 54:07.940
And Simi Jacobs...

54:07.940 --> 54:11.820
..is not a match to the blood
found at the scene.

54:11.820 --> 54:13.420
Oh, for goodness' sake!

54:13.420 --> 54:15.620
Are we ever going to get a match
on that sample?

54:17.300 --> 54:18.580
Yes.

54:20.780 --> 54:22.060
Who is it?

54:22.060 --> 54:23.820
Erm...

54:23.820 --> 54:25.500
It's Wilfred Okoye.

54:26.700 --> 54:28.460
The patient? Mm.

54:29.700 --> 54:30.900
That's impossible.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.020
According to this, he's our killer.

54:33.020 --> 54:37.180
Arnie Rahul was murdered by a man
who was under general anaesthetic

54:37.180 --> 54:38.620
in a different room?

54:50.220 --> 54:51.620
Bonsoir.

54:53.660 --> 54:55.100
Thank you.

55:01.460 --> 55:02.780
Who are you?

55:04.700 --> 55:06.140
Oh...

55:17.260 --> 55:18.740
Nikki?

55:20.220 --> 55:21.860
Adam, we need to talk.

55:21.860 --> 55:23.580
No, you need to listen.

55:25.580 --> 55:28.140
When I applied for this job,
I falsified my CV.

55:28.140 --> 55:29.460
What?

55:29.460 --> 55:31.580
"February to August, 2008,

55:31.580 --> 55:35.180
"Fellowship in surgery at the Heng
Medical Institute in Singapore."

55:35.180 --> 55:37.740
It never happened.
I never went near the place.

55:37.740 --> 55:39.020
I lied.

55:41.860 --> 55:43.980
And Emily Braithwaite
tried to use this fact to

55:43.980 --> 55:45.940
influence my findings in
the Fletcher case.

55:53.180 --> 55:56.220
It's my letter of resignation.
Effective immediately.

56:11.740 --> 56:16.700
