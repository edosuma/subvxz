00:15.306 --> 00:18.435
Okay, okay, okay!

00:18.601 --> 00:21.021
Ah! Ooh!

00:21.021 --> 00:23.148
And Sophie wins!

00:23.314 --> 00:25.066
Yes!

00:25.066 --> 00:26.317
Woo!
Sophie,

00:26.484 --> 00:29.529
I hereby present you
with my plus-one ticket

00:29.696 --> 00:30.822
for tonight's premiere party

00:30.989 --> 00:32.115
to <i>Flubber: the Musical.</i>

00:32.282 --> 00:35.744
Whoo-hoo-hoo! I get to
go to a fancy-ass party!

00:35.910 --> 00:37.287
Oh.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.206
And my Halo says
that I burned 200 calories!

00:40.206 --> 00:41.791
Sophie is peaking.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.627
- I let her win.
- I know. Me, too.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.504
Point is, we're strong. Strong on three.
One, two, three.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.630
Strong!

00:47.756 --> 00:48.965
Okay. Whatever helps you sleep at night.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.927
You getting promoted was the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

00:53.094 --> 00:54.721
What can I say?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.140
Styling a Broadway star has its perks.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.142
I still can't believe
you dressed Daphne Dupree

00:59.142 --> 01:00.518
and lived to tell the tale.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.936
The way I heard, when she was in <i>Les Mis,</i>

01:01.936 --> 01:03.938
she pushed little Cosette
into the orchestra pit.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.607
Daphne's a nightmare!

01:05.607 --> 01:07.984
She rejected, like, 200 dresses.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.487
How about this dress for the premiere?

01:10.653 --> 01:14.199
It's foot-sewn by a woman
with no hands. <i>Très chic.</i>

01:14.365 --> 01:17.035
You're lucky I had
my salivary glands removed,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.204
or I'd spit on that foot dress right now.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.164
Why did you...?

01:21.331 --> 01:23.083
I didn't wanna be tempted by solid foods.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.836
But I finally found a gown

01:26.836 --> 01:28.379
that she absolutely loved.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.048
Oh, my God, what am I gonna wear?

01:30.048 --> 01:32.759
A mini? A midi? A maxi? Oh my!

01:37.347 --> 01:39.307
Come on, guys. We'll have fun here.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.892
I'll give you each one drink free.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.728
Oh, wow. That is huge for us.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.064
We have definitely been
paying for all our drinks.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.400
Oh, hey! Is it cool if I invite my new
lady friend, Dana?

01:49.567 --> 01:50.568
- Lady friend?
- Yeah.

01:50.693 --> 01:51.945
I've got two male friends named Dana.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.988
I'm trying to be clear. (scoffs) Anyway,

01:54.155 --> 01:57.450
we, uh, <i>matched</i> the other day,
and then, we met up last night,

01:57.450 --> 02:00.370
and the rest is... kiss-tory.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.872
Look, I-I think it's great

02:02.872 --> 02:05.125
that you're getting back
out there post-Meredith,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.001
- but you've known this girl...
- Uh-huh.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.586
- ...for, like, a day.
- Yep.

02:08.753 --> 02:09.963
It feels fast for a friend blend.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.381
Yeah, man. You know the rules.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.049
No introducing new people to the group

02:13.049 --> 02:15.385
unless you've been dating for two weeks.
Or if they're dying.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.594
Well, she is dying!

02:16.761 --> 02:18.763
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.974
In the sense that we all are.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.810
Look, what do you want me to say? I really
like this girl, alright?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.478
I'm sorry, guys, but I'm invoking...

02:26.479 --> 02:28.439
...the Welcome Protocol.

02:28.606 --> 02:32.402
It's a complex method.
We bust it out whenever one of us

02:32.402 --> 02:34.779
wanted to <i>dazzle</i> a new love interest.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.490
For instance, when Ellen
brought her girlfriend Rachel

02:37.657 --> 02:39.075
<i>into the fold...</i>

02:41.452 --> 02:44.664
We each had a specific role.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.957
There's the Hype Men,

02:46.124 --> 02:47.333
<i>who brag up a storm.</i>

02:49.085 --> 02:51.254
Rachel, did you know Ellen's been asked

02:51.254 --> 02:53.214
to be a hair model five times?

02:53.214 --> 02:54.966
In the last <i>week?</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:57.844
No way! You never told me that!

02:58.678 --> 03:02.390
There's the Bathroom Bestie
who goes deep with a newcomer.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.727
I don't know. Sometimes I think

03:05.727 --> 03:08.104
I don't have what it takes
to make it in this city.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.649
We all experience Impostor Syndrome.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.443
Even Miley Cyrus.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.903
You're so right.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.574
There's the Human Fodder,
who is <i>so</i> ridiculous

03:19.574 --> 03:21.826
that it gives everyone
someone to bond over.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.122
Take a gander at this.

03:26.122 --> 03:29.125
I got the bottom of my shoes
engraved with my full name!

03:31.377 --> 03:33.379
Oh, he's so ridiculous!

03:34.005 --> 03:35.882
And lastly, the Giggler.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.552
The one who laughs
at all the friend's jokes

03:39.552 --> 03:40.887
to make them seem like

03:40.887 --> 03:44.265
<i>`the</i> most charming person in the world.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.853
And then, I swallowed a full piano key.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.897
F sharp. Or should I say...

03:50.897 --> 03:53.316
<i>♪ F sharp? ♪</i>

03:53.483 --> 03:55.526
God, Ellen,

03:55.693 --> 03:57.946
you're so funny! I'm dying!

03:58.863 --> 04:01.449
Dude, the Welcome Protocol
is extremely exhausting.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.035
We can't just trot it out
for a one-date nobody.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.329
I slept for three days straight
after the last one.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.206
And one of those days
was National Roommate Day.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.458
Ellen and I were going to
play hide-and-seek at the Met.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.252
I still did. And Charlie never found me.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.587
Also, Sophie and Val aren't here,

04:14.587 --> 04:16.965
which means I'd have to be
Bathroom Bestie <i>and</i> Giggler.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.801
I can't giggle while
I use the bathroom! I'll toot!

04:19.968 --> 04:22.303
Okay, look, I'm sorry,
but it's been invoked,

04:22.303 --> 04:24.722
and per the protocol, once invoked,

04:24.722 --> 04:25.848
it cannot be uninvoked.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.355
What? Just practicing.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.280
Okay. Let's make the most of this party.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.572
I'm on drinks. You're on food.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.741
Keep the sweets and the savory separate.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.744
- And if you run out of hands--
- I know, I know. Carry it in my mouth.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.378
These look like the future residents

04:55.378 --> 04:59.382
of Sophie Tompkins' stomach.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.430
What are you doing?

05:06.681 --> 05:09.475
- I'm eating.
- Oh, it's not ready yet.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.769
What are <i>you</i> doing? Give me that back.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.314
What is wrong with--

05:15.440 --> 05:17.608
- Why are you so tall?
- Why are you so short?

05:17.775 --> 05:20.528
You can't just go asking people
why they're so short.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.822
Ah...

05:24.282 --> 05:27.452
Now, it's ready.
I'm Robert, the meticulous chef.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.495
I'm Sophie,

05:29.495 --> 05:31.080
annoyed party guest.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.458
And just because I introduced myself,

05:33.458 --> 05:34.584
doesn't mean I want to talk to you.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.088
Actually, wait. Um...

05:39.630 --> 05:41.466
Do you know where I could get some ranch?

05:42.091 --> 05:44.761
Seriously? That's yellowtail crudo.

05:44.927 --> 05:48.056
Yeah. And you don't have to be so <i>rude-o.</i>

05:51.809 --> 05:53.561
Here's your Flub-tini.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.231
The bartender winked at me
and said he put extra flub in there.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.400
I really don't know what that means.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.277
Valentina.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.406
You really pulled this off.
I was wrong to say

06:05.406 --> 06:08.910
that a subway mole rat
could style me better than you.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.745
You never said that.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.372
Oh. I meant to.

06:14.248 --> 06:17.001
I am really gonna pop on that stage later

06:17.001 --> 06:18.336
when I sing, "My Heart Flubs For You."

06:19.420 --> 06:22.924
I'm sorry. I just--
I just get a little emotional

06:22.924 --> 06:26.511
whenever I think of my enemies
watching me sing so beautifully.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.388
Nevin!

06:33.017 --> 06:35.561
Okay, but she looks incredible, Val.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.397
I know! I killed it.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.024
- Oh, she really does look great.
- Oh!

06:40.191 --> 06:41.734
Oh! Oh, so does she.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.739
Ah. Someone else wearing the same dress.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.866
Yeah, no, she'll be normal about that.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.284
Uh--

06:50.451 --> 06:52.161
Come over here.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.664
Ooh.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.749
Fix it, and we'll try again later, hm?

07:00.169 --> 07:03.172
I have some pocket yellowtail,
if it'll make you feel better.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.763
Oh God! Here they come.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.225
Guys, I'd like you to meet Dana!

07:14.392 --> 07:17.478
Isn't she effortlessly cool,
but also somehow sweet?

07:18.312 --> 07:20.898
Sorry. I've clearly been in my own head
about introducing you.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.567
Thanks for letting me crash your hang.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.111
Duh! We were so excited to meet you.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.363
Let's, uh, let's get you a drink. Yeah.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.870
So, did you know that Jesse

07:34.036 --> 07:37.665
has saved <i>five</i> wounded baby birds?

07:38.374 --> 07:41.043
I didn't know that. He's so great.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.712
Oh, the greatest.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.756
Is that a red tuxedo
on that bourbon bottle?

07:47.341 --> 07:49.343
It is. Yeah, it's actually a nod to--

07:49.510 --> 07:50.595
The gold room bar from <i>The Shining</i>?

07:50.761 --> 07:54.474
On a bottle of Jack, too.
That's brilliant.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.519
Okay. You are the only person
to ever get that reference.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.229
Maybe you are worth the protocol.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.564
What?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.232
I said...

08:03.232 --> 08:06.027
maybe you are the pro to call...

08:06.027 --> 08:07.445
if I have movie questions.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.864
- Oh.
- Nice save...

08:10.740 --> 08:11.657
What?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.369
This is all my fault.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.914
I was so sleep deprived
from showing her 200 looks,

08:18.080 --> 08:21.125
I forgot to tell the designer
not to let anyone else wear it!

08:21.292 --> 08:22.960
I wish they could do that with tattoos

08:22.960 --> 08:25.671
because I would hate for someone else
to have my singing Garfield.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.216
Okay. Sorry.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.342
We can fix this.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.847
You know that's sauce, not soup, right?

08:35.681 --> 08:38.809
No time to explain, Sauce Cop.
I'm in the middle of something.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.521
So am I. Dinner for 300 fat cats.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.272
Could you maybe leave them some sauce?

08:43.439 --> 08:45.441
Oh, could you maybe not sauce-shame me?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.238
So then, I said, "Reese Witherspoon?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.281
More like Reese without her spoon!"

08:53.574 --> 08:56.077
Hey! Watch it!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.788
God! Oh! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

08:59.497 --> 09:02.667
You know what they say.
Don't... sauce up and gossip?

09:04.043 --> 09:07.129
Uh, here. Please take my duster.
It's the least I could do.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.507
- Oh, I don't think so...
- Oh.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.925
Used to be Kerry Washington's.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.219
- Oh. I love her!
- Yeah.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.805
- I miss <i>Scandal</i>.
- Oh, we all do. We all do.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.933
<i>And</i> this is how Kerry used to wear it.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.143
- Nice and tight!
- Oh.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.897
Uh, off you go! Have fun now! Bye!

09:25.982 --> 09:29.277
Oh, I am getting so many
compliments on this dress.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.654
I am so glad I invited
three of my ex-husbands.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.115
Oh, Mandy.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.829
Mission accomplished.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.414
- Let's get another drink.
- Yeah.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.209
Yeah, you wanna go with the "Flubarita"
or the "Flub on the Beach"?

09:45.376 --> 09:46.794
Just a classic gin and--

09:46.794 --> 09:48.296
Mother-(bleep)!

09:51.090 --> 09:54.260
Out of curiosity, were you gonna say
tonic or juice?

09:54.927 --> 09:56.971
This is it. This is the end of my career.

09:58.931 --> 09:59.974
Unless...

10:01.434 --> 10:03.561
Mother-(bleep).

10:07.982 --> 10:09.734
Twist. Dana's the best.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.152
She's a goddamn dream!

10:11.944 --> 10:14.071
Wow. Being bullied like that

10:14.071 --> 10:15.781
must've been really hard for you.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.909
It was, but enough about me.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.369
Jesse says you work in produce,

10:20.536 --> 10:22.788
which is pretty much
my favorite food category.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.373
Yukon Golds.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.917
Those are just russet potatoes
left out in the sun, right?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.797
She actually asked me about my interests.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.049
You guys never ask me about my--

10:33.215 --> 10:35.343
Ellen, I want to say why I like her.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.012
When I did human fodder,
she didn't laugh at me.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.389
She made me feel seen.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.644
And <i>that</i> is why I always wear
a collared shirt to the cinema.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.606
I completely agree. I wish people still
got dressed up to fly!

10:50.399 --> 10:52.818
He should marry that girl.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.863
- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.
- Yeah?

10:55.863 --> 10:57.573
Dude, we were so wrong about Dana.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.824
We're so happy to welcome her.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.493
- Thrilled.
- We love her.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.537
Yeah. Uh, about that...

11:04.705 --> 11:06.248
I changed my mind. I mean, she's great,

11:06.248 --> 11:08.542
but we just don't have... it.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.586
Sometimes I'm glad
we're not related by blood!

11:10.586 --> 11:11.962
Your <i>face</i> doesn't have it.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.256
Let's nix the Welcome Protocol,

11:14.256 --> 11:17.093
and go straight to
the Fake Emergency Protocol.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.056
So then, I said, "Reese Witherspoon?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.600
More like Reese without her spoon!"

11:27.687 --> 11:30.690
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry I spilled on you.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.108
You're probably gonna wanna change.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.984
Nah, who cares?

11:33.984 --> 11:36.737
I already spilled on myself
three times today.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.572
Classic Nance!

11:38.739 --> 11:42.743
Are you sure you don't want to
change into my friend's dress?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.829
What show do you miss?
A star of that wore this.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.124
Kathy Bates wore that on <i>Harry's Law?</i>

11:50.209 --> 11:51.585
- Uh-huh!
- Yes.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.171
I still don't understand

11:54.171 --> 11:55.756
why you couldn't give Nance <i>your</i> dress.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.133
I can't do Nance dirty like that.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.801
She can't pull off seafoam.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.346
- I'll swipe you a coat from coat check.
- Fine.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.933
But, if I get bedbugs again,
you <i>cannot</i> tell anyone.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.018
That cannot be my thing.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.064
Holy shit.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.692
That famous lady is wearing
the same dress I am!

12:15.818 --> 12:18.362
I shop like a celebrity.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.699
- Shush please... No!
- Well, look at that!

12:21.866 --> 12:23.534
I'm also matching you, too!

12:24.702 --> 12:27.455
Hey, girl, it's me. Do me a solid
and make Daphne go blind,

12:27.621 --> 12:30.833
just for the rest of the night
because I'm a good person, girl! Amen!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.418
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.629
I am wearing the same dress
as two other women.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.465
That hasn't happened to me since I starred

12:37.465 --> 12:40.342
in that extremely problematic
revival of <i>Dreamgirls.</i>

12:43.679 --> 12:45.347
And don't google it.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.815
Val, where are you?

12:54.815 --> 12:57.234
Why aren't you answering
any of your texts?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.652
Now, I have to leave you a voicemail,

12:58.652 --> 12:59.945
and I hate leaving voicemails.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.698
Especially because I know
you're never gonna check it.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.660
Your singing voice isn't
as strong as you think it is.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.828
Ha! Bye.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.706
Turn around!

13:10.873 --> 13:12.416
I did turn around!
You want me to turn back?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.710
- No, no, no, no!
- I will-- Uh--

13:20.007 --> 13:21.342
Daphne.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.053
I am so sorry about the dress.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.221
Save it.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.890
I'm gonna ruin you.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.476
You will never work
in this town again.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.063
Are-- are you crying?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.816
Can't. I had my tear ducts removed.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.567
- Why did you--
- Oh,

13:38.734 --> 13:40.528
the surgeon who took out my saliva glands

13:40.528 --> 13:41.821
read my chart wrong.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.699
That was a bad day.
And yet, this is worse.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.830
Oh, 40 years in the business,
and here I am.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.500
Cast off to a junior incompetent stylist

13:54.500 --> 13:57.670
and starring in a musical
about Silly Putty.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.881
The only reason I took this stupid job

14:00.881 --> 14:03.509
was because my reps told me
being in a family show

14:03.509 --> 14:06.262
would make me seem
more a, "A woman of the people."

14:07.304 --> 14:09.390
Apparently, I don't have
the best reputation.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.100
Hm.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.393
Boy, you start one rumor

14:12.393 --> 14:13.811
that Lea Michele can't read...

14:13.978 --> 14:16.939
- That was you?
- Okay, I admit that

14:16.939 --> 14:18.858
I can be a <i>tad</i> cutthroat,

14:19.024 --> 14:21.443
but that's only because
I have had to scrape

14:21.443 --> 14:23.445
and claw my entire career.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.948
- I get that.
- Oh, no, you don't.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.658
Not unless you've starred in <i>Fiddler</i>

14:27.658 --> 14:29.410
with a very handsy Tevye.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.580
How about this?

14:34.290 --> 14:37.501
I save your rep, I help you
become a woman of the people,

14:37.501 --> 14:40.004
and you don't ruin my career?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.672
Alright, I'm listening.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.508
But, I can't do anything

14:44.508 --> 14:46.385
that involves crying or spitting
because I have--

14:46.552 --> 14:49.013
No ducts or glands. I-I got it.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.892
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.102
My mom's calling. She never calls.
I need to take this.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.064
- Hello?
- It's Mom. I was in an accident.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.441
I hate you.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.151
I'll be right there!

15:02.151 --> 15:04.194
Dana, I'm so sorry.
My mom's been in a car accident.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.280
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.616
Dad just called. Mom--

15:08.782 --> 15:11.368
I know. I know. We need to go
to the hospital right now.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.497
And I will drive you
to the hospital as you are distraught.

15:15.664 --> 15:16.999
Dana, Dana, I tried calling you.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.125
Grandma's in the hospital.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.793
Oh, my God!

15:19.793 --> 15:23.297
Jesse, I'm so sorry
about your mom, but I gotta go.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.299
Yeah, no, no, of course. I'm s-- Wait--

15:25.299 --> 15:27.217
Oh. Okay.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.055
Wow. Oh, bravo, you two.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.515
You doing your fake emergency
right at the tail end

15:33.515 --> 15:35.392
of my fake emergency to really sell it.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.978
It's, uh... it's genius.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.316
- What are you talking ab--
- Come on, Dana, cut the crap, alright?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.360
We obviously both realized
we weren't feeling it,

15:44.360 --> 15:47.237
and we faked emergencies.
Let's call it what it is.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.572
What?

15:48.697 --> 15:51.408
Jesse, my grandma
is actually in the hospital.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.498
But she's a bigot,
and you're not close to her?

15:57.498 --> 15:58.707
I'm hoping.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.503
She's gay and a humanitarian, you asshole!

16:05.089 --> 16:06.340
You could have married her,

16:06.340 --> 16:08.842
and we could have had
a gay grandma-in-law?

16:08.842 --> 16:09.969
Thanks for nothing.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.726
Do you mind if I hide out in here?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.853
Because I don't really wanna
go out there dressed like this.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.189
No problem, chef. Stir this.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.484
How'd you end up
half-naked in my pantry anyway?

16:26.026 --> 16:27.528
Oh...

16:27.528 --> 16:28.529
Helping out a friend.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.699
Tonight is kind of
"make or break" for her.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.452
It would all seem crazy to
someone as established as you.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.912
How do you know I'm established?

16:37.746 --> 16:40.582
I may or may not have googled you
while I was stuck in the pantry.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.668
Ah.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.336
Hey, I googled you, too.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.008
"Woman falls in sinkhole
on Cinco de Mayo."

16:49.883 --> 16:53.262
I trended because of that.
Hashtag, "sinkhole de Mayo."

16:53.929 --> 16:54.930
Ha!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.350
You were thinking about me
when you were in there?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.686
Only because you were so obnoxious.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.187
I was thinking about you, too.

17:03.814 --> 17:04.815
Here, try this.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.740
Oh, my God.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.575
Is that what I think it is?

17:14.742 --> 17:15.784
Yeah.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.328
You just made your very own ranch.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.165
Hm.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.459
Mm!

17:23.667 --> 17:26.795
Now, here I thought you could only
get this from the Hidden Valley.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.719
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Trust me. You're going to kill.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.597
Uh... Thank you.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.434
