WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:08.508
- Oh, I gave it
to his old neurologist.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.301
Came by to check on him.
- Neurologist?

00:10.343 --> 00:12.178
I don't have a neurologist.
- Yes, you do.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.139
He was just here, Dr. Todd.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.724
- Who the fuck is Dr. Todd?

00:15.765 --> 00:17.434
- Oh, shit.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.893
- What?
- Don't worry.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.980
Dr. Todd said cognitive lapses
and memory loss

00:22.022 --> 00:23.565
are a common side effect
of brain trauma.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.192
- Okay, I don't know
any Dr. Todds.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.360
- He said
you'd probably say that.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.945
- Oh, my--okay,
yeah, this isn't working.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.113
Can I talk to your boss?

00:30.155 --> 00:32.032
- He said
you'd probably say that too.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.199
- Fuck off, all right?

00:33.241 --> 00:34.200
Stop gaslighting me,
you lying...

00:34.242 --> 00:35.535
both: Sack of dog shit!

00:35.577 --> 00:37.871
- Boy, did he really call
this whole interaction.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.622
- Dr. Todd isn't a real doctor.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.082
- What do you mean?
Of course he is.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.042
- Did he show you
identification?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.543
- He was wearing scrubs.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.337
- Oh, cool,
that proves he has $11.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.755
How could you give
a stranger access

00:46.796 --> 00:47.797
to an unconscious patient?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.215
- He made eye contact.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.010
He touched my elbow
and asked with a serious voice,

00:52.052 --> 00:55.472
"When did the hospital start
allowing teenage nurses?"

00:55.513 --> 00:56.723
See,
I'm a little self-conscious

00:56.765 --> 00:58.099
about getting older.
- You look fine.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.934
Will you please call security?
- Okay.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.186
- Craig,
what the hell is going on?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.855
- Dr. Todd is Isaiah's
fake identity

01:03.897 --> 01:05.565
from his time in Phoenix.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.067
He must have snuck in here
to steal the dongle

01:07.108 --> 01:08.401
and give it back to Rodney.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.196
- So I'm fucked?
I'm not gonna be a farm owner?

01:11.237 --> 01:12.405
- I was more worried
about Jillian,

01:12.447 --> 01:14.074
the person whose life
is in danger.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.241
- My life is in danger.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.411
I have no job, no money,
no health care.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.246
I'm not gonna be able
to pay for this.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.289
So it's gonna be what we call

01:21.331 --> 01:22.832
a "treat it and beat it"
situation.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.751
I'm gonna need you to body-slam
that fucking nurse

01:24.793 --> 01:26.252
when she comes back in here,
and then I'm gonna sprint

01:26.294 --> 01:27.504
out those doors, okay?

01:27.545 --> 01:28.963
Is that a plan?
- Wait, Dad.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.131
What about my college fund?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.050
- "What about my college fund,
Dad?"

01:32.092 --> 01:34.761
I would never touch your
precious college fund, Corby.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.513
Your mother wouldn't
give me access to it.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.598
Stop making this about you.
This is about me.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.101
- This is about Jillian.
- This is about all of us!

01:41.142 --> 01:43.269
We are unified
in our struggles.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.479
I want you
to look up the phrase

01:44.521 --> 01:46.064
"intersectionality," Craig.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.982
- Shut up.
Let me make a call.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.109
[tense music]

01:49.150 --> 01:50.360
[cell phone buzzing]

01:50.402 --> 01:51.945
- Where the hell have you been?

01:51.986 --> 01:53.321
- We have a problem.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.407
Isaiah stole the dongle.
He's giving it to your dad.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.617
- [sighs] Why did I have
to choose the nice brother?

01:57.659 --> 01:59.369
- Hey, we got that call
with Macao.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.287
You joining or what?
- Can't Isaiah do it?

02:01.329 --> 02:02.956
- I don't know
where the fuck he is.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.958
- Fine, I'll be there in a sec.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.418
I'm talking with Mom.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.045
- Ugh.
[quietly] I'm not here.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.964
- Isaiah hasn't shown up yet,

02:11.006 --> 02:14.259
so you better get here
before he does and stop him.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.969
Okay?

02:16.011 --> 02:18.972
Or else, we are both so fucked.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.849
Do you want to know how fucked?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.267
Imagine...

02:22.308 --> 02:25.228
[tense music]

02:25.270 --> 02:27.188
* *

02:27.230 --> 02:30.275
- You're 12 years old.
How do you even know that word?

02:30.316 --> 02:33.236
[dramatic music]

02:33.278 --> 02:35.447
* *

02:35.488 --> 02:38.575
[thunder rumbling]

02:40.410 --> 02:42.871
- Where the fuck is this guy?
It's fucking cold in here.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.497
- That's why I told you
to put on pants.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.124
- No, you told me time
was of the essence.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.167
Come on, crank the seat heater.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.501
- Yeah, that's just
what I need,

02:48.543 --> 02:50.837
your bare asshole sweating
little booty kisses

02:50.879 --> 02:52.255
all over the seats.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.548
- So what do we do
if we see Isaiah?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.425
- We stop him out front and--
- No.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.177
I'll tell you what we gonna do.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.846
We're gonna put him to sleep.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.098
That's why I tore this puppy
off the wall at the hospital.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.725
It's filled with needles.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.977
I'ma put 'em between my fingers
and stick him like Wolverine.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.520
- That's why you took that?

03:07.562 --> 03:09.189
- One of 'em's gotta be filled
with anesthesia.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.607
- Be careful, Dad.
That's dangerous.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.192
- Christ, Corby,
unclench, okay?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.693
It's only dangerous
if you don't know

03:13.735 --> 03:14.944
what you're--oh!

03:14.986 --> 03:18.156
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.366
What's the worst
that could happen?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.492
- Hepatitis.
- Syphilis.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.327
- HIV.
- Yeah, probably HIV.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.745
- Okay, God damn.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.747
That's the last time
I come to you two for support.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.502
Mm, there, see?
I sucked it out.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.128
- You sucked it in!

03:32.170 --> 03:34.381
We are not sticking my brother
with used needles.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.383
- You got a better plan?
- Yes.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.051
I'ma talk to him,
ask him why he's doing this.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.719
- [scoffs]
That's your plan?

03:39.761 --> 03:42.597
Talk to a guy that's fucked you
over at least a dozen times.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.226
Yikes, I'm not excited to be
business partners with you.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.394
[phone buzzing]
- Holy shit.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.688
It's Isaiah. Hold on.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.522
Zay!

03:50.563 --> 03:52.065
- Yo, big bro!

03:52.107 --> 03:53.566
What's good, man?

03:53.608 --> 03:54.901
- You stole my dongle.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.611
I need that dongle.
Where's my fucking dongle?

03:56.653 --> 03:57.987
- You really gotta stop
saying dongle, big bro.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.489
It's a goofy word,

03:59.531 --> 04:01.032
and it undermines the urgency
you're trying to convey.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.867
- Do you know what will happen
if you give that to Rodney?

04:02.909 --> 04:03.785
Jillian could die.

04:03.827 --> 04:04.911
- I know.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.996
That's why
I'm not giving it to Rodney.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.707
I'm giving it to you.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.042
- What?
But you took it from me.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.502
- No, I took it
from a public hospital,

04:12.544 --> 04:13.753
which was very easy
to sneak into.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.005
All I had to do
was touch somebody's elbow.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.381
You and Prada
should be thanking me.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.008
- I don't get it.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.926
If you were on my side,
why didn't you say something?

04:19.968 --> 04:21.428
- I had some shit
to sort out on my end.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.804
Look, I sent you a pin,
all right?

04:22.846 --> 04:23.805
Just come meet me.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.056
I'll tell you everything
in person.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.225
- Is this real?
Am I getting the farm back?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.185
- Yeah, man.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.104
And Jillian's gonna be okay.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.106
Just get your ass down here.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.816
[sighs]

04:34.858 --> 04:36.693
- Oh, fuck yeah!

04:36.735 --> 04:39.112
Yes! We did it!
Whoo!

04:39.154 --> 04:40.572
All right, first thing's first,

04:40.613 --> 04:42.157
I think I'm gonna do
a full audit on the farm.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.658
You know, when you get a hog,

04:43.700 --> 04:45.201
you gotta lift up its tail
and look right in its asshole.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.786
- You don't get to do an audit.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.414
- Heh, spoken like a man whose
hog is filled with tapeworms.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.832
Okay, how bad is it?

04:50.874 --> 04:52.459
You know what?
Hey, doesn't matter.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.419
I'm here now.
Steady hand on the till.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.796
Let this be a lesson, Corby.
Okay? Ears up.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.132
When you take over a business,
the entrenched interest

04:59.174 --> 05:00.467
will always resist progress.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.760
But remember, they're failures.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.136
They don't know
what they're talking--

05:03.178 --> 05:04.471
- I don't know why
you think you get a say

05:04.512 --> 05:05.680
in how the farm is gonna run.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.976
- Well,
'cause I'm a part owner.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.561
- Are you though?

05:11.603 --> 05:12.812
I mean, we just talked.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.522
We didn't officially agree
on anything.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.317
- Well, I mean, yeah, we did.
We had a deal.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.943
- Mm, I don't know.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.487
I feel like, if we had a deal,
we would have signed something.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.864
- Jesus, Dad, that's, like,
the whole thing we're learning

05:22.906 --> 05:24.574
in my sports management
seminar.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.493
Always get that Jane Hancock.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.161
My professor's a woman.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.372
- Hey, do not criticize me till
you can beat me in a fight!

05:30.413 --> 05:32.540
Okay, that's how
father-son stuff works!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.959
All right--Craig, hey!
Craig, Craig!

05:35.001 --> 05:36.503
Where are you going?
- Sorry, Brock.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.796
I gotta go meet
with my brother.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.464
You're good to Uber, right?
- No!

05:39.506 --> 05:41.091
No, we are not good to Uber!

05:41.132 --> 05:43.968
Okay, all right, calm down.
Everybody, calm down.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.220
Listen to me.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.472
I know you don't give a shit
about me, okay?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.432
But what about Corby?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.351
He fucking loves
to go to school so much.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.103
Now he's gonna have
to drop out.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.854
'Cause I blew through
the college fund.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.356
- What? You did?

05:56.398 --> 05:58.400
- Talk to your mother,
Corby, okay?

05:58.441 --> 05:59.651
It's not my fault
her security questions

05:59.693 --> 06:01.027
were so easy to guess.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.862
- But you said an education
was the ultimate gift

06:02.904 --> 06:05.073
was the ultimate gift
from a father to a son.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.033
- Well, Elton John's lawyers
don't give a shit

06:07.075 --> 06:09.619
about my beautiful
fucking promises!

06:10.537 --> 06:13.957
Craig, please.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.250
Think about the kid.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.545
* *

06:18.586 --> 06:20.505
- I'm sorry your dad
did this to you, Corby.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.508
[soft music]

06:23.550 --> 06:26.678
* *

06:26.720 --> 06:28.680
- I see you, Craig!

06:28.722 --> 06:31.683
I got one eye,
and I still see you!

06:32.976 --> 06:34.978
Motherfucker.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.439
[bell jingling]

06:37.480 --> 06:40.275
- * I feel it's true *

06:40.316 --> 06:42.193
[bell dings]
- Order up!

06:43.611 --> 06:44.654
- What's up?

06:44.696 --> 06:45.905
You gon' tell me
what's going on?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.574
- Yeah, uh, sure.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.034
Before we get to that,
you hungry, man?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.785
You want a fry?

06:51.953 --> 06:53.747
- No, I don't want
fucking fries.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.249
I want the dongle
you said you had for me.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.793
- Right, so about the dongle,

06:58.835 --> 07:00.879
little change of plans.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.298
I had to give it to Rodney.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.216
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.094
Something unexpected came up.
I got a more appealing offer.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.763
- I don't understand.
What about Jillian?

07:09.804 --> 07:11.306
- She's gonna be fine.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.766
They probably won't even
kill her.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.560
They'll just--I don't know--
slice her up a little bit.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.437
- I swear to God, Zay.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.397
You are evil!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.149
I will never forgive you
for this.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.776
- Okay, I get that,
but let's not pretend

07:22.817 --> 07:24.194
like I'm the only one
at fault here.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.987
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Who else would be at fault?

07:26.029 --> 07:28.114
- I don't know, maybe the fool
that cut a side deal

07:28.156 --> 07:29.574
with a bunch
of swamp criminals.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.659
- What the fuck?
I didn't have a choice, Isaiah.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.161
I was gonna lose my farm.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.496
- That's the difference
between us.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.206
I know I'm a shitty person,

07:36.247 --> 07:37.999
but you're still out here
pretending you're good.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.709
- Anyone would have done
what I did.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.294
- You think Dad would
have did that shit?

07:41.336 --> 07:44.798
I mean, before he died
of prostate cancer?

07:44.839 --> 07:47.634
- Fuck you, Zay.
I'm a good person.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.511
And you don't deserve fries.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.179
Or coffee.

[tense music]

08:02.315 --> 08:04.526
- Hey, hey, over here.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.736
I think they're gone.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.572
Here's the plan.
You and I can get out of here.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.243
All you have to do
is come up here and...

08:13.284 --> 08:14.411
peck these ropes.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.079
[bird trills]

08:16.121 --> 08:17.455
You're hungry, right?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.625
Well, guess what?
There are lots of bugs up here.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.088
They're on the ropes that are
binding my wrists and feet.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.425
So if you want them,
you're welcome to them.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.051
Just come on up here.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.846
Mmm, these bugs smell good.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.223
You can--
- What--what the fuck?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.100
Come on! Fucker.

08:37.142 --> 08:41.312
Get the fuck out of here,
shittin' all over my carpets.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.276
Why were you talking
to that bird?

08:46.317 --> 08:47.777
- Um...

08:47.819 --> 08:49.154
I've gone crazy.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.321
- Why is it even in here?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.991
Who the fuck left
the back door open?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.785
- Ray-Nathan and Natalie-Ray
left in a hurry.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.787
- They had one job,
to watch you.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.707
What, they fucking
deputized this egret?

09:00.749 --> 09:04.669
- Well, Ray-Nathan got a call
about an ex-performer here.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.755
I guess she was poking
around in your taxes

09:06.796 --> 09:08.089
and got you guys shut down.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.176
- Oh, that turncoat stripper
Kathay-Ann.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.552
- Yes, that's the one.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.637
Well, someone saw her
in Little Rock,

09:14.679 --> 09:16.348
so they went up there
to talk to her.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.183
But they took baseball bats
with them,

09:18.224 --> 09:20.560
so I think they're gonna do
more than just talking.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.687
- I got a colonoscopy
appointment today.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.856
I gotta get
to the goddamn hospital.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.317
Who the fuck's
gonna get me there?

09:27.359 --> 09:28.902
God damn it!

09:28.943 --> 09:32.238
And what am I gonna do
with you?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.656
- I told them not to go.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.159
I said,
"What if your mum needs you?

09:36.201 --> 09:39.037
She's the best.
She's so normal and nice."

09:39.079 --> 09:40.663
That's what I said.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.500
- You got any gas
in that Kia of yours?

09:43.541 --> 09:47.337
- About 1/8 of a tank.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.673
- All right, that'll work.

[rock music playin]

09:54.594 --> 09:57.138
- So colonoscopy.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.015
Is everything okay?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.892
- It's no big deal.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.812
I just gotta get mine now
because I only have eight days

10:03.853 --> 10:05.980
until my fucking insurance
runs out.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.524
- If it's no big deal,

10:07.565 --> 10:09.234
then why do you need someone
to bring you?

10:09.275 --> 10:12.028
- 'Cause that hoity-toity nurse
said I can't drive myself

10:12.070 --> 10:14.280
on anesthesia.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.366

its one thought of the day.

in the hospital garage

10:32.257 --> 10:34.467

10:34.509 --> 10:37.429

the rag's clean, right?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.930
Right?

10:39.806 --> 10:40.974
Right?

10:41.016 --> 10:44.227
- Oh, yeah, it'll be
the cleanest one I have.

Come here.

- [sighs]
Thank God.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.456
It turns out,

11:04.497 --> 11:06.666
I hate being gagged.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.294
- Yeah, well,
there's a change in plans.

won't release me.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.846
So you're coming up
to the surgery suite.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.766
- Oh, so you're gonna untie me?

11:22.807 --> 11:25.185
- Yeah, but if you try
talking to someone

11:25.226 --> 11:26.978
or sneaking away,

11:27.020 --> 11:30.732
or if I don't wake up
and see your big old dopey eyes

do you?

11:43.495 --> 11:45.497
- No, I do not.

- So I'll hurt you,
and I'll hurt Craig.

well, if you ain't fucking,

12:00.679 --> 12:03.139
then you won't mind
if I cut off his dick

12:03.181 --> 12:05.475

in front of you.

that hospital gown from home.

such different accents.

I didn't know about her
till she was 20.

It was a late in life miracle.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.089
Can we just move on?

13:18.131 --> 13:21.217
- Well, this is all just
precautionary, right?

13:21.259 --> 13:22.969
No unusual symptoms?

13:23.011 --> 13:25.388
- Well, I have had blood
in my stool,

13:25.430 --> 13:27.599
but that can be from anything--

- Oh, well,
someone has been Googling.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.276
And you're right,
that doesn't necessarily have

13:38.318 --> 13:40.320
to be a cause for concern.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.489
Is the blood red or black?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.199
- Black.
- Hmm. Interesting.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.450
- Interesting?

13:45.492 --> 13:48.119
Can you believe this fuck
trying to scare me?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.871
Probably so he can charge more.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.831
You're supposed to say
everything will be fine.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.625
- I'm just trying
to assess the situation.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.959

where'd you get

13:55.001 --> 13:56.920

and fuck your hospital.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.054

for 24 hours,

14:06.096 --> 14:08.348
and I got the low blood sugar.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.184
- Well, I understand.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.103
It happens.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.437
Sometimes.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.856
I'm gonna go get prepped.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.069

it's okay to be scared.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.113
- I'm not scared.
You're fucking scared.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.906
- Shouldn't I be scared?
I'm a hostage.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.908
- Yeah, exactly.
That's my point.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.702
Nobody's scared.
We're all scared.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.953
Just shut up.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.080

There's a waiting room
down the hall.

in about an hour.

a quick hug?

14:39.337 --> 14:43.174
I got mean-ass kids,
a nephew who's a cop,

14:43.216 --> 14:47.804
and a bunch of inbred cousins
who are addicted to violence.

14:47.846 --> 14:51.182

Ms. Boone.

We tried calling you,
but you hadn't actually

15:50.533 --> 15:51.785
put down a phone number.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.329
- I'm sorry.
I needed some air.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.373
- Well, we finished
your mom's procedure.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.000
I can't say anything
for sure yet,

15:59.042 --> 16:00.877
and we'll know more
once we get the biopsies.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.837
- Biopsies?
- Yes.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.048
The number and size
of polyps in her colon

16:05.090 --> 16:06.549
were very concerning.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.634
- Oh, no.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.802
- You're gonna want to schedule

16:08.843 --> 16:10.303
additional imaging right away.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.306
Now, if it is cancer
and it's spread,

16:13.348 --> 16:15.225
it does usually go
to the liver first,

16:15.266 --> 16:17.894
but it can also get
into the lymph system

16:17.936 --> 16:20.563
or even the brain.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.911
- Oh, I'm sure she's
around here somewhere.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.788
You're probably thirsty.
How about a juice box?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.873
- I don't want
your fucking juice box.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.458
I need my daughter.
Where is she?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.794
- I can't help you with that,
but I can get you a juice box.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.629
- Enough with
your fucking juice box.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.131
I need my daughter!

16:46.172 --> 16:49.175
- Mum, Mum, I'm right here.
I just stepped out.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.556
- Good girl, smart girl.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.935
Hey, Juice Box,
can you get my drawers?

16:59.936 --> 17:01.938
We can leave now, right?

17:01.980 --> 17:04.566

There's a Lil' Piggies
near here, my treat.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.835
I mean, I'll pay you back.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.230
- Are you okay?

17:44.272 --> 17:47.776
- Yeah, I knew there was
something wrong, and there was.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.319
I'm not surprised.

17:49.361 --> 17:51.738
I've been bleeding out of my
ass for three straight years.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.406
- Whoa.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.367
That's a lot of...

17:55.408 --> 17:56.785
straight years.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.037
Why didn't you go
to the doctor?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.997
- 'Cause I was scared.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.415
I'm a big fucking pussy,

18:02.457 --> 18:04.334
and I'm just getting
what I deserve.

18:04.376 --> 18:07.212
- You are not a pussy.
You're a terrifying maniac.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.130
- You're just saying that.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.258
- I'm really not.
You seem genuinely unhinged.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.553
- That's real nice of you,
Jillian, but I know what I am.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.056
I couldn't even get
a colonoscopy

18:18.098 --> 18:20.475
without bringing you along
to hold my hand

18:20.517 --> 18:22.060
and to stab this straw

18:22.102 --> 18:25.146
into this little bitch baby
juice box.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.481
- But I thought the nurse said
you needed someone

18:26.523 --> 18:27.607
to check you out.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.777
- I was lying.
I had it all planned out.

18:30.819 --> 18:34.197
I sent the kids on that wild
goose chase to Little Rock.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.907
And then I was gonna
bring myself,

18:35.949 --> 18:37.575
and then take an Uber home.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.495
And then I woke up
just paralyzed.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.374
And I knew what was coming.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.419
And I just couldn't
face it on my own.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.295
- Why didn't you want your kids
to go with you?

18:49.337 --> 18:51.381
- They can't know I'm sick.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.300
If I died now,
what would I even leave them,

18:54.342 --> 18:56.511
that tiddlywink
criminal empire?

18:56.553 --> 18:58.763
Or that piece of shit
strip club

18:58.805 --> 19:00.098
with a million birds in it?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.308
- Don't be silly.
Carpets is lovely.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.728
And some of those birds
are really pretty.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.688
- Used to be,
you could send your kid out

19:06.730 --> 19:08.273
into the world with nothing,

19:08.314 --> 19:10.942
and even if they were dumb,

19:10.984 --> 19:13.820
they would still
do better than you.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.072
And now your kid
can be a genius,

19:16.114 --> 19:17.824
but if you don't
leave 'em a fortune,

19:17.866 --> 19:19.034
they're still fucked.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.454
And believe me,
my two ain't geniuses.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.414
I failed them.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.250
They're gonna be so mad at me.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.627
Goddamn anesthesia
still in my system

19:29.669 --> 19:32.297
got me talking out my ass.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.758
- When my dad
had his heart attack,

19:34.799 --> 19:38.303
he left me with nothing,
and I didn't hate him.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.930
I just hated
that I never got to say goodbye

19:40.972 --> 19:42.891
before he was gone.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.434
If there's something
really wrong,

19:44.476 --> 19:47.187
I promise your kids
are gonna want to know.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.774
* *

19:50.815 --> 19:54.110
- Where were you?
And why's she not zip-tied?

19:54.152 --> 19:55.945
You took her to Lil' Piggies?

19:55.987 --> 19:57.238
- You didn't ask us
if we wanted any?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.282
- We didn't just go
to Lil' Piggies.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.952
Jillian took me
to my colonoscopy appointment.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.579
- Why do you need
a colonoscopy?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.998
- Are you crazy?
She could have told someone.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.333
And a colonoscopy,
that's anesthesia.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.959
She could have run off!

20:10.001 --> 20:13.171
- I made it very clear to her
that that would be a bad idea.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.297
- What the fuck?

20:14.339 --> 20:16.633
- Hey,
Jillian is a nice person.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.636
And she was with me
during a very scary time.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.805
- Why is it scary?
Is something wrong?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.598
- She's manipulating you, Mom!

20:23.640 --> 20:25.642
She wants you to like her,
so we won't hurt her!

20:25.684 --> 20:26.893
- And we won't hurt her!

20:26.935 --> 20:29.479
I will not let anything happen
to this girl!

20:29.521 --> 20:32.065
- That's fucking bullshit!
- No, you're fucking bullshit.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.442
- Shut the fuck up!
Mom, are you okay?

20:34.484 --> 20:36.778
Why did you get a colonoscopy?
Are you okay?

20:36.820 --> 20:39.364
- Listen, baby, it's unclear.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.324
I'm still waiting
on some lab results.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.243
But I want you
to know one thing.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.371
I will always--

20:46.413 --> 20:47.789
- Ahh!

20:47.831 --> 20:49.749
- Mama, you're out
of your fucking mind!

20:49.791 --> 20:53.211
[dramatic music]

21:00.885 --> 21:04.180
[tense music]

21:04.222 --> 21:05.724
- God, I can't
believe this shit.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.933
- Maya!

21:06.975 --> 21:08.476
- I knew it was too good
to be fucking true.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.603
- Maya, wait, Maya, stop!
- But, oh, every fucking time.

21:10.645 --> 21:15.233
Every time--God.
- Maya, Maya!

21:15.275 --> 21:16.943
And I get
end-of-the-year bonuses.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.362
And we're going on a company
retreat in March.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.823
And I get a polo
with a logo on it.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.075
It is so fucking boring,
but I'm so excited

21:24.117 --> 21:26.119
because being boring

21:26.161 --> 21:27.746
means
I might get to be with you.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.331
* *

21:30.373 --> 21:32.667
I know you'll never forgive
Dr. Todd,

21:32.709 --> 21:36.004
and you shouldn't--he's shady.

21:36.046 --> 21:39.674
But I was really hoping--

21:39.716 --> 21:43.261
girl, I'm praying
you give Isaiah a chance.

21:43.303 --> 21:47.682
* *

21:47.724 --> 21:50.518
- You have a half an hour,
one half hour to tell me

21:50.560 --> 21:53.730
who you really are.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.523
- Okay.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.817
Half hour, I got this.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.027
* *

21:59.069 --> 22:02.072
- * Way down *

22:02.113 --> 22:06.368
* Way down it must be,
I can't stop *

22:06.409 --> 22:08.745
- Please say something.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.414
- Well, when you told me
you weren't really a doctor,

22:11.456 --> 22:13.124
I was like, wow,
that's a big drop.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.959
Can't get any crazier
than that.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.294
But the bank robberies,

22:16.336 --> 22:17.629
and the psycho millionaire
killing his son,

22:17.671 --> 22:19.381
and the snake eating the body?

22:19.422 --> 22:20.715
What the fuck?
- I know, I know.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.550
I know it's a lot,
but now you know everything.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.762
Okay, no more surprises,
I promise.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.891
- Okay.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.226
I believe you.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.436
- Oh, fuck, great.
Hey, barkeep!

22:33.478 --> 22:35.021
Can I get a bottle of champagne
for me and my girl

22:35.063 --> 22:36.022
who I just won back?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.524
- You did not win me back.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.734
Just because you're honest
doesn't change the situation.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.277
- I thought we could
kind of start fresh.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.279
- What exactly
are you picturing?

22:43.321 --> 22:45.115
You're Marty the energy dealer
at work.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.951
You're Isaiah at home.
You're Todd to all my friends.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.036
I can't be in a relationship
with all three of these people.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.579
- I'm just one person.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.248
I can be one person.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.417
No more Marty, no more Todd.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.584
Just Isaiah.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.503
- But Isaiah's
a fucking criminal.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.755
- He doesn't have to be.
He can be good.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.509
Give me a chance to prove
I can change for you.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.761
Give me a chance
to make things right.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.725
- I'll give you two months.

23:11.766 --> 23:13.101
- All right.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.644
Cool.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.565
It's a lot of variables
at play,

23:18.606 --> 23:20.442
some of which could
get me killed.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.735
How about five?

23:21.776 --> 23:23.069
- Are you seriously
negotiating with me?

23:23.111 --> 23:24.863
- Two months is perfect.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.823
Perfect timing.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.369
I'll see you then!

23:32.037 --> 23:33.455
[tense music]

23:33.496 --> 23:34.873
- Got about 15 minutes.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.791
- Okay.
- See you up there.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.960
- Yeah, I'll meet you there
and just let me know.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.962
- Hey. How you doing?

23:41.004 --> 23:42.547
My name is Isaiah Foster.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.965
I don't really know
if I'm doing this right,

23:44.007 --> 23:47.802
but I'd like to speak
with someone at the FBI.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.889
- So I've read your statement,
Mr. Foster.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.891
* *

23:52.932 --> 23:54.726
And I want to thank you.

23:54.768 --> 23:57.479
We've had our eye on
Rodney Lamonca for a long time.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.980
And with the information
you've provided us,

23:59.022 --> 24:01.566
I imagine a judge
being very lenient.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.610
Only wish you had
come forward sooner.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.278
- Look, I was scared.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.946
Rodney has friends
in the Miami PD.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.573
Plus,
cops don't generally serve

24:08.615 --> 24:09.657
and protect dudes like me.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.368
- Well, I'm not a cop.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.661
You can tell because I can read
without moving my lips,

24:13.703 --> 24:16.081
and my son still talks to me.

24:16.122 --> 24:20.543
Look, I promise you,
we're not all bad.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.045
I joined the bureau...
[phone buzzing]

24:22.087 --> 24:23.505
To put scumbags

24:23.546 --> 24:25.882
like Rodney Lamonca to--

24:25.924 --> 24:27.759
- You got somebody texting you?

24:27.801 --> 24:30.470
- Just give me one second.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.681
* *

24:32.722 --> 24:34.891
You're doing great.

24:39.521 --> 24:43.316
- Well, well, well, look at
this piece of shit right here.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.651
- What happened to the other--

24:44.693 --> 24:46.528
- Oh, sorry,
did you want your mommy?

24:46.569 --> 24:49.447
Oh, she's gone, Stuart Little.
Daddy's home now.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.032
- Oh, shit,
this ain't gon' be good.

24:51.074 --> 24:54.577
- Yeah, box kick!
God, I am the Grim Reaper.

24:54.619 --> 24:55.995
I am the Slender Man.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.998
I am gonna stomp your ass,
Mini-Me.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.376
My name is Agent Burton.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.044
And you really fucked up.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.380
- By coming in
and offering to help?

25:05.422 --> 25:07.507
- I think...

25:07.549 --> 25:10.093
it was when you hid
a body in a snake.

25:10.135 --> 25:11.720
Hold on.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.888
And then what you decided
to do was just

25:13.930 --> 25:17.183
waltz on in here
and tell us about it.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.977
- Because I'm cooperating.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.312
I can prove that Rodney Lamonca
committed a murder.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.064
- Oh, my God, a murder?

25:23.106 --> 25:25.817
Oh, do you see a shiny toy star
on my uniform?

25:25.859 --> 25:27.152
- What?

25:27.193 --> 25:29.112
- Do you see a doughnut
sticking out of my pants?

25:29.154 --> 25:32.866
Because you must think I'm the
sheriff of Dingleberry County.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.785
I'm the FBI.
We do real crimes here.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.579
I don't give a shit
about murder.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.372
- Murder is a real crime.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.790
- Oh, "Murder is a real crime."

25:40.832 --> 25:42.208
- The lady said you guys
have been looking

25:42.250 --> 25:43.501
for Rodney for a while now.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.670
- Yeah, because he is
a national security risk.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.756
We have reason to believe
that Rodney Lamonca

25:47.797 --> 25:50.759
is in possession of some
very sensitive documents.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.177
- What the fuck,
like nuclear shit?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.929
- Oh, yeah, let me just check
your security clearance.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.890
Oh, it's level
fucking skid mark.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.850
The only thing
you need to understand

25:58.892 --> 26:01.353
is that you're gonna help me
get those documents back.

26:01.394 --> 26:04.105
I need you on the inside.

26:04.147 --> 26:07.525
- You want me to go undercover
with Rodney Lamonca?

26:07.567 --> 26:09.861
No fucking way.
- All right.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.489
Then go to prison for
conspiracy to commit murder.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.823
That's fine with me.

26:13.865 --> 26:15.825
I mean, a pretty guy like you,

26:15.867 --> 26:17.702
you're gonna be real popular
behind bars,

26:17.744 --> 26:21.206
like a human suck bot.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.541
Oh, I can say that
because I'm bisexual.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.959
- Okay.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.045
- I'm sorry, does that
make you uncomfortable?

26:27.087 --> 26:29.714
I've been out for 14 years.
Bigots like you don't scare me.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.965
- Rodney wants me dead.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.801
How would I even convince him
to hire me back?

26:32.842 --> 26:34.636
- I don't know.
You seem like a clever guy.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.680
You'll figure something out.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.642
- Fuck.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.268
- Well, you got some
big brass balls calling me

26:42.310 --> 26:43.395
out of the blue like this.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.521
You know how much trouble
you caused me?

26:44.562 --> 26:46.773
- With the cops?
- No, with my wife.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.858
Ever since Katrina found out
that her son was murdered,

26:48.900 --> 26:50.151
she's been a total buzzkill.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.486
She stopped whitening
her teeth.

26:51.528 --> 26:53.154
She let her fillers go to shit.

26:53.196 --> 26:55.240
It's like being married
to a fucking jack-o'-lantern.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.866
I don't even enjoy cheating
on her anymore

26:56.908 --> 26:57.909
because she deserves it.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.160
So here's what I'm gonna do.

26:59.202 --> 27:00.578
I'm gonna shoot you
in the fucking head.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.788
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I think he just pulled a gun.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.332
Should we go in?
We should go in.

27:04.374 --> 27:07.293
- Oh, my God, what would we do
if this terrible human being

27:07.335 --> 27:08.461
wasn't alive anymore?

27:08.503 --> 27:10.964
Jesus Christ,
stop being such a pussy.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.257
You know why I can say that,
right?

27:12.298 --> 27:13.383
- Yeah, because you're bi.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.926
But what if Rodney
kills our asset?

27:14.968 --> 27:17.637
- Well then, I'll send a
12-pack of soda to the funeral.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.306
Just shut up.
I want to see where this goes.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.518
- Go on.
- Three words.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.730
Saw, Palmetto, berries.

27:26.771 --> 27:29.190
* *

27:29.232 --> 27:30.734
- I'm listening.

27:30.775 --> 27:34.070
* *

27:34.112 --> 27:36.322
- Yo!

27:40.744 --> 27:43.997
You're not gonna sit with me?
- Don't look at me, Thumbelina.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.249
Stare straight ahead,
pretend you're alone,

27:46.291 --> 27:49.252
and order some fucking fries
so you don't look like a freak.

27:49.878 --> 27:52.756
- Hey, hey,
can I get some fries?

27:52.797 --> 27:54.007
- Yeah, one second, sir.

27:54.049 --> 27:55.383
- It's been
three fucking weeks.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.844
Are you ever gonna tell me
what these documents are?

27:57.886 --> 28:00.138
- I don't know you well enough
yet to trust you,

28:00.180 --> 28:02.807
so unless you want to suck my
dick and fondle my asshole...

28:02.849 --> 28:04.851
- Jesus.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

28:04.893 --> 28:07.062
Is the way that I love weird
to you, you homophobe?

28:07.103 --> 28:08.980
- I just need to know
what I'm looking for.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.899
- You are looking for Rodney's
secret second phone.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.275
That's where he keeps
the documents

28:12.317 --> 28:14.402
that you're not allowed
to know about.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.905
- I know that phone,
and it's always on him,

28:16.946 --> 28:18.156
so how am I supposed to get it?

28:18.198 --> 28:19.657
- I don't know.
You're a smart guy.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.076
You'll figure it out.

28:21.117 --> 28:23.745
- Wait, wait, you think
I should fight a shark?

28:23.787 --> 28:25.038
- You're launching
"Predator Power."

28:25.080 --> 28:27.290
You need this night to be
unforgettable.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.168
I mean,
unless you're too scared.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.087
- Fuck you.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.422
I'm never too scared
because I don't have fear.

28:34.464 --> 28:37.133
Fear is just a product
of our imagination.

28:37.175 --> 28:39.636
It's something the great
Eric Stonestreet taught me.

28:39.678 --> 28:41.012
- So you'll do it?
- I wish.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.972
It's just, you know,
I'm the CEO, remember?

28:43.014 --> 28:45.058
I don't have time
to train for a shark fight.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.602
- I know, I know,
which is why I think

28:47.644 --> 28:49.270
you should use a stunt double.

28:49.312 --> 28:50.563
both: Like Pitbull.

28:50.605 --> 28:51.940
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, this I like.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.109
This shit is gonna make
people's titties hard.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.111
It's gonna make
their sacks get all tight!

28:56.152 --> 28:58.822
Ooh, we're gonna blow
people's fucking--

28:58.863 --> 29:00.615
[crowd screaming]

29:00.657 --> 29:02.534
- Oh, this is bad!

29:02.575 --> 29:05.829
You guys, this is really bad!

29:07.163 --> 29:08.957
- Is there a doctor?
Is anyone a doctor?

29:08.998 --> 29:10.333
- The fuck's going on?

29:10.375 --> 29:12.419
- The shark ate him!
The shark ate Rodney!

29:12.460 --> 29:13.753
Is anyone a doctor here?

29:13.795 --> 29:16.339
- I'm a pimple popper!
- I review lotions!

29:16.381 --> 29:18.299
[phone rings]

29:18.341 --> 29:19.342
- Did you get it?

29:19.384 --> 29:21.136
- No, but I got a lead
on a dongle

29:21.177 --> 29:23.471
with data
from Rodney's secret phone.

29:23.513 --> 29:24.973
- Ooh, okay,

29:25.015 --> 29:27.642
that's that good news
that Daddy's been waiting for.

29:27.684 --> 29:28.852
- Okay, but once
you get the files,

29:28.893 --> 29:30.478
I need you to give
the dongle back to me.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.813
- What, why?

29:31.855 --> 29:33.106
- So I can give it
to my brother.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.942
There's some other sensitive
data up there

29:35.984 --> 29:37.777
that he needs
to do his own thing.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.988
- All right, well,
that's fucking random.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.740
But yeah, sure.
Who cares, all right?

29:41.781 --> 29:44.325
Just get Daddy his dongle,
okay?

29:46.036 --> 29:48.079
- Hey. How you doing?

29:48.121 --> 29:50.707
I'm Dr. Todd Stevenson
from Phoenix General.

29:50.749 --> 29:53.710
A patient of mine was recently
admitted with a head wound.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.007
- Gloria.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.759
Did he order food?
- No.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.677
- This motherfucker.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.721
Are you gonna order food?

30:04.763 --> 30:05.847
- No, I thought,
since this was over,

30:05.889 --> 30:06.973
we could stop the charade.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.767
- Sitting by yourself
drinking coffee,

30:08.808 --> 30:10.685
you look like you just
got out of rehab.

30:10.727 --> 30:13.730
Order some fucking
French fries.

30:13.772 --> 30:16.316
- Hey, can I get an order
of fries please?

30:16.358 --> 30:18.735
- It's not here.
- What do you mean?

30:18.777 --> 30:19.986
- I scanned everything.
It's not here.

30:20.028 --> 30:22.030
- God, you fucked me,
you little shit.

30:22.072 --> 30:23.698
- Me?
- No, I'm looking at you.

30:23.740 --> 30:24.866
But I'm talking to him.

30:24.908 --> 30:26.201
I've been doing it
the whole time.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.745
You fucked me, Isaiah.
- How could I fuck you?

30:28.787 --> 30:29.788
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.331
- Shh!

30:31.373 --> 30:33.583
* *

30:33.625 --> 30:35.835
Okay, here.

30:36.836 --> 30:40.757
I am working under direct order
from a very important person

30:40.799 --> 30:43.343
in the executive branch.

30:43.385 --> 30:46.012
Now, that person has reason
to believe

30:46.054 --> 30:47.889
that Rodney Lamonca
is in possession

30:47.931 --> 30:50.266
of a humiliating personal photo

30:50.308 --> 30:52.185
of a sitting senator
from Texas.

30:52.227 --> 30:53.853
- Wait, all this is
because Donald Trump

30:53.895 --> 30:55.146
wants a dick pic of Ted Cruz?

30:55.188 --> 30:56.731
- No, I never said that.
You said that.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.775
He said that, and besides,

30:58.817 --> 30:59.901
why would Donald Trump
want a picture

30:59.943 --> 31:01.236
of Ted Cruz's
weird-looking dick?

31:01.277 --> 31:03.071
What, so he can pull it out
at meetings?

31:03.113 --> 31:04.406
Oh, shit, I don't know.
That would be funny.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.074
- Well, how weird
is Ted Cruz's dick?

31:06.116 --> 31:07.492
- Well, I don't know.

31:07.534 --> 31:08.660
To go through all this trouble,
it's got to be

31:08.702 --> 31:10.245
pretty fucking weird, right?

31:10.286 --> 31:11.413
- I don't understand.
Okay, Rodney killed somebody.

31:11.454 --> 31:12.956
He just had somebody else
eaten by a shark.

31:12.997 --> 31:16.251
I have evidence of multiple
financial crimes he committed.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.752
But all you seem to care about
is some weird,

31:17.794 --> 31:19.295
petty political blackmail?

31:19.337 --> 31:20.755
You're the FBI.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.675
- The FBI was built on weird,
petty politcal blackmail.

31:23.717 --> 31:24.759
Grow up.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.094
Now, here's what
you're gonna do.

31:26.136 --> 31:28.013
You're gonna give that dongle
back to Rodney,

31:28.054 --> 31:30.223
sell out your brother,
prove your loyalty,

31:30.265 --> 31:32.392
and become the kind of
close personal advisor

31:32.434 --> 31:35.020
with whom Rodney would share
disgusting photos

31:35.061 --> 31:37.272
of famous dicks,
whose ever they might be.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.357
- I already called Craig.
He's on his way here right now.

31:39.399 --> 31:40.775
- Well, I don't give
a rat's ass,

31:40.817 --> 31:43.028
and you know what, I'm gonna
fucking sit right here,

31:43.069 --> 31:45.155
and I am gonna watch you
tell your brother

31:45.196 --> 31:46.531
that he's gonna get fucked,
okay?

31:46.573 --> 31:47.991
Or else I'm not giving you
back the dongle.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.409
* *

31:49.451 --> 31:51.244
- Here you are.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.329
- Thank you.

31:53.371 --> 32:00.337
* *

32:03.673 --> 32:05.508
[bell dings]
- Order up!

32:06.760 --> 32:07.802
- What's up?

32:07.844 --> 32:08.887
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

32:08.928 --> 32:10.555
- Yeah, uh, sure.

32:10.597 --> 32:11.973
Before we get to that,
you hungry, man?

32:12.015 --> 32:13.850
You want a fry?

32:17.854 --> 32:19.481
- No, I don't want
fucking fries.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.483
I want the dongle
you said you had for me.

32:21.524 --> 32:25.195
- Yeah, right,
so about the dongle,

32:25.236 --> 32:27.197
little change of plans.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.074
I had to give it to Rodney.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.326
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:31.368 --> 32:35.080
Something unexpected came up.
I got a more appealing offer.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.664
- I don't understand.
What about Jillian?

32:36.706 --> 32:38.333
- She's gonna be fine.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.793
Probably won't even kill her.

32:39.834 --> 32:42.170
They'll just--I don't know--
slice her up a little bit.

32:42.212 --> 32:44.589
- I swear to God, Zay.

32:44.631 --> 32:46.424
You are evil!

32:46.466 --> 32:47.926
I will never forgive you
for this.

32:47.967 --> 32:52.263
* *

32:52.305 --> 32:55.266
- There he is!
There he is!

32:55.308 --> 32:57.852
Fucking Al Pacino back there!

32:57.894 --> 32:59.604
"I'm a good person."

32:59.646 --> 33:01.856
Ah, you spit a little bit
when you said it.

33:01.898 --> 33:03.191
It was awesome.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.026
- Zay, seriously,
what the fuck?

33:05.068 --> 33:06.986
Why we have to do that?
Who was that even for?

33:07.028 --> 33:08.822
- [sighs]

33:08.863 --> 33:10.573
Okay, I'm working for the FBI.

33:10.615 --> 33:11.700
- FBI?
- Yeah.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.201
But they tried to fuck me.

33:13.243 --> 33:15.245
They just wanted me to give
the dongle back to Rodney.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.706
But I had other plans.

33:17.747 --> 33:19.499
- Okay, dongle!

33:19.541 --> 33:21.793
- Hopefully, that little
one-act play we did in there

33:21.835 --> 33:23.211
will give me a head start.

33:23.253 --> 33:25.130
- Wait, what do you mean,
head start?

33:25.171 --> 33:26.214
What's gonna happen
when they find out

33:26.256 --> 33:27.549
you didn't give this to Rodney?

33:27.590 --> 33:28.883
- I'll probably have
to go back on the run.

33:28.925 --> 33:31.011
Maybe to prison.
- Prison?

33:31.052 --> 33:32.429
Zay, you did that for me?

33:32.470 --> 33:33.888
- No.

33:33.930 --> 33:36.182
I did it for Maya.

33:38.935 --> 33:41.229
- I mean, that sounds sweet,

33:41.271 --> 33:43.106
but it's also
kind of insulting.

33:43.148 --> 33:45.233
Like, you could have just said
it was for me.

33:45.275 --> 33:46.818
Would have been a nice moment.

33:46.860 --> 33:48.194
She's not even here.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.238
- Take the win, Craigory.
You got the dongle.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.698
- I got the dongle.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.074
- And sorry I went
a little rough on you

33:53.116 --> 33:54.659
back there in the diner.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.578
- Yeah, but that wasn't real.
We were doing a thing, right?

33:56.619 --> 33:59.456
You don't actually think
I'm a bad person.

33:59.497 --> 34:01.332
Do you?

34:02.125 --> 34:05.045
- I love you, man.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.047
- I love you too.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.256
But you didn't answer
my question.

34:08.298 --> 34:09.674
- You don't got time
for all this, okay?

34:09.716 --> 34:11.426
Get that to Prada.

34:11.468 --> 34:13.053
Go save Jillian.

34:13.094 --> 34:15.513
* *

34:15.555 --> 34:17.724
- Calling all Boones!
I come with good news!

34:17.766 --> 34:19.976
I can hire you back!

34:20.977 --> 34:22.812
Hello!

34:22.854 --> 34:29.986
* *

34:32.906 --> 34:34.532
Oh, shit.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.494
[upbeat music]

34:37.535 --> 34:44.501
* *

34:47.504 --> 34:50.632
- * I'm not in this world *

34:50.674 --> 34:54.594
* To live up
to your expectations *

34:54.636 --> 35:01.309
* Neither are you here
to live up to mine, yeah *
