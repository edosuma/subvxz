00:00.875 --> 00:01.960
[Lena] Previously
on The Fosters:

00:02.043 --> 00:03.169
There's this girl, Sarah.

00:03.211 --> 00:04.713
Liam told me you would
do something like this.

00:04.796 --> 00:07.549
He doesn't love you, Sarah,
he's just using you.

00:07.632 --> 00:08.550
You don't know that.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.677
We're adopting the baby.

00:12.053 --> 00:16.599
Seems one of the bigwigs at
Idyllwild saw you play at some
music competition last Fall

00:16.641 --> 00:20.979
and would like to offer you
a full ride to their summer
music program.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.522
So you can go
on the tour.

00:22.605 --> 00:26.526
Yes, but I want to go
to Idyllwild, if I can get it.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.988
I saw Ana at my dad's.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.533
I guess she's been sending
letters to her parents,
trying to make amends,

00:33.616 --> 00:37.037
but they keep
returning them, unopened.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.915
If her parents knew that Ana
was pregnant maybe they would
take it.

00:40.999 --> 00:44.210
Daria and Taylor
are sneaking out tomorrow night

00:44.252 --> 00:45.628
and they want us to come.

00:45.670 --> 00:49.466
My dad's got tons of booze.
Let's break in and steal some.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.595
- (groans)
- [man] Hey! Who's there?!

00:53.636 --> 00:55.263
[gasping] It's my dad!

00:55.305 --> 00:56.890
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:56.931 --> 00:58.767
[gunfire]

00:59.517 --> 01:01.895
I guess he thought his daughter
was spending the night out,

01:01.978 --> 01:04.938
so when the kids snuck
in to get some alcohol he
thought he was being robbed

01:04.980 --> 01:08.651
and grabbed his gun,
it was dark, he fired,
and he hit the boy.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.153
They're working
on him now.

01:10.195 --> 01:13.406
- OK, thank you.
- You bet.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.711
He's gonna be
OK, love.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.422
He's gonna be all right.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.056
The bullet entered the foot
here, and thankfully passed
clean through.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.266
We need to operate
to repair the tendons
but I don't think

01:40.308 --> 01:43.144
we're talking about
permanent damage here.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.897
[sighs] Um...

01:45.980 --> 01:49.526
He, uh, he plays baseball,
is he still gonna be able to?

01:49.609 --> 01:53.279
Well, he's not gonna be
on the field anytime soon,
but you can tell the Padres

01:53.363 --> 01:55.406
to keep holding his spot
in the line-up.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.410
I'm gonna send the nurses in,
to get you prepped, and we'll
get this taken care of.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.371
[sighs]

02:02.163 --> 02:03.206
Thank you.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.375
What the hell were you thinking,
sneaking out like that?

02:05.416 --> 02:08.711
What kind of idiot
breaks into someone's house
in the middle of the night?

02:08.752 --> 02:13.091
Is this about that girl?
That Daria? Is that why you did
this? Is that why you snuck out?

02:13.174 --> 02:14.592
- No.
- It's not?
It's not why you did it?

02:14.634 --> 02:18.972
It's not, OK?! I snuck out
so I could see Jude, all right?!

02:25.019 --> 02:26.980
What does that mean?

02:32.944 --> 02:36.322
Stealing alcohol?
Who's idea was that?

02:37.282 --> 02:41.744
I don't...
I can't really remember.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.623
Jude, you are way
too young to be drinking.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.375
I know.

02:48.376 --> 02:52.297
We weren't...
We weren't thinking, I guess.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.510
I'm really sorry.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.516
- How is he?
- He's OK.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.476
They're getting ready
for surgery.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.728
Can I see him?

03:06.811 --> 03:10.356
Um... not right now.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.358
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.194
Sure.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.032
[speaks indistinct]

03:21.743 --> 03:24.621
[no audio]

03:24.704 --> 03:28.791
[Stef] He's gonna be in surgery
for a while now. There's nothing
we can do here

03:28.833 --> 03:31.878
so we should
probably go home.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.974
What did he say?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.685
He said that he doesn't
want you to see Connor.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.104
What about tomorrow?

03:50.188 --> 03:53.858
No. He doesn't want you
to see Connor at all.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.655
He doesn't think
you should be friends anymore.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.870
Connor told him
it was all your idea,

04:05.954 --> 04:08.873
the sneaking out,
the drinking, all of it.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.376
Is that true?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.556
♪ It's not
where you come from ♪

04:25.598 --> 04:28.518
♪ It's where you belong ♪

04:28.559 --> 04:34.607
♪ Nothing I would trade
I wouldn't have it
any other way ♪

04:34.691 --> 04:40.280

04:43.616 --> 04:49.205
♪ You are home with me

04:58.089 --> 05:01.509
- So is he gonna go to jail?
- I don't think so.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.637
He turned himself in to police
right away, and it was
unintentional, so...

05:04.679 --> 05:08.391
They were in his house, right?
I mean, doesn't California
have a Stand Your Ground law?

05:08.474 --> 05:09.851
Yeah, something
like it, anyway.

05:09.892 --> 05:13.563
So now we have to worry
about which of our kids'
friends' parents

05:13.646 --> 05:16.607
keep guns in the house?
The times we live in...

05:16.649 --> 05:18.609
Well, you have a gun
in the house, right, Mom.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.571
Yes, I do, but it's for my work
and it locked up in a safe.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.031
So what are you guys
gonna do to Jude?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.366
Don't worry about Jude's
consequences,
we will handle that.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.536
Just don't pick on him.
He had a really bad night.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.204
I didn't think
he had it in him.

05:30.288 --> 05:35.293
I know we said that we were
gonna tell the kids today
about adopting the baby

05:35.335 --> 05:37.545
- but it can wait,
don't you think?
- You think?

05:37.587 --> 05:42.675
That is, of course, unless you
have some other super secret
plan you're keeping from me?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.053
All right,
I've gotta get dressed.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.721
Hey, can I ride
with you today?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.390
- Why are you going to school?
It's teacher work day.
- Dance team.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.184
Sure, honey, but Mom
and I have to meet

05:51.267 --> 05:53.770
with Callie's social worker,
so, it'll be a bit.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.063
OK.

05:55.104 --> 05:59.692
Oh, and, hey, you're still
taking me driving today, right?
After the dentist?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.611
You're giving Mariana a
driving lesson?

06:01.652 --> 06:05.198
- What, wait a minute,
when did I say this?
- Last week.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.574
No fair.
I have my permit too.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.659
And only one of you
had to take the test twice.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.537
Shut up! Those questions
were way too obvious.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.997
I thought they were
trying to trick me.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.209
"When you come to a stop sign,
you should a) always stop,

06:16.250 --> 06:20.588
b) sometimes stop, c) stop
except in an emergency."

06:20.671 --> 06:22.298
Always stop? Really?

06:22.340 --> 06:25.093
- I figured it couldn't
be that stupid, could it?
- Turns out, it was.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.846
Well, listen, even if I did say
I would take you driving, and
I'm not saying I did, I forgot.

06:28.930 --> 06:33.226
And I also forgot you have
a dentist appointment. So your
brother'll have to take you.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.603
What? No... I do have a life,
you know.

06:35.686 --> 06:42.443
Yes, we know you do.
And we all appreciate the huge
sacrifices that you make for us.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.739
You know, there is someone who
could teach us how to drive.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.577
No. No way.
Not happening.

06:51.619 --> 06:55.748
You've never done anything
like this before, Jude,
I don't get it.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.251
Was it Connor's idea?

07:00.128 --> 07:04.132
I think he's a bad influence
on you. I don't think you guys
should be hanging out as much.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.300
- You know what, shut up.
- Excuse me?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.886
- Do not talk to me like that.
- Then stop telling me
what to do.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.721
And you don't have to worry
about me and Connor hanging out

07:10.805 --> 07:14.434
because his dad said
we're not allowed
to be friends anymore, OK?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.438
Maybe that's for the best.
You'll make new friends.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.897
Just leave me alone.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.568
[door slams]

07:25.027 --> 07:27.405
So you're sure
it's OK if I take this?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.573
Yeah, it's fine.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.783
OK, I'll get it back
to you when I'm...

07:30.867 --> 07:34.829
[chuckling] What? When you're
done sleeping forever?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.205
Just keep it.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.917
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to move out.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.294
Mike,
we been through this.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.671
I'll back off,
I'll let you alone.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.884
Just... [sighs] stay.

07:48.593 --> 07:53.264
Look, I know it's not the
perfect place, but it's fine.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.516
and it's
just until I have the baby,

07:55.558 --> 08:00.271
and then, when I give her
to Stef and Lena, I'll figure
something else out.

08:00.354 --> 08:05.651
Maybe I'll move to Riverside
or find some place cheaper.

08:05.735 --> 08:10.156
So you're decided?
A hundred percent?

08:12.408 --> 08:15.077
She's gonna grow up
in a wonderful home,

08:15.119 --> 08:20.333
with her brother and sister.
It's the right thing.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.670
[Joan] Emancipation is a long,
involved process.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.548
Yes, well, we don't have
a long time to get it
taken care of, so...

08:27.632 --> 08:31.677
OK then, the first thing you
need to do is you've gotta
get off probation.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.013
There's no point in even
starting things until
that's cleared up.

08:34.096 --> 08:37.265
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem, she has a probation
hearing coming next week.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.352
Yeah, and her P.O.
is 100 percent on board.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.354
OK, good, but...

08:41.395 --> 08:45.691
...when did you start taking
out credit cards, Callie?

08:47.568 --> 08:48.945
I... I don't have any.

08:49.028 --> 08:52.782
Really? Because I pulled
your credit report,
to get things ready for today,

08:52.823 --> 08:57.495
and it looks like you've got
four delinquent cards.

08:57.578 --> 09:01.499
- What?
- No, there must be some
mistake, these aren't mine.

09:01.541 --> 09:07.380
Are you sure about that? Because
according to this, you've
accrued about $24,000 in debt.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.888
Are you sure you didn't sign
up for something, maybe online?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.682
No! No, I swear.
I can't believe this.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.976
How can someone just take out
credit cards in my name?

09:20.017 --> 09:24.814
It's pretty easy, unfortunately.
All people need are a few pieces
of personal information.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.692
OK, well, resolving this
with the credit bureaus
can take years.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.988
So if this is true,
the only way you're going
to get off probation

09:32.071 --> 09:35.241
is to prove that someone
else stole your identity.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.245
Great. So how are we
supposed to do that?

09:39.287 --> 09:42.957
Prove that someone else did
all this? I have to be in front
of the judge in a week?

09:42.999 --> 09:45.459
It's what I do, Callie.
Just let me figure it out.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.087
And what if you can't?
What then?

09:53.676 --> 09:58.097
The poor kid is so devastated
that Connor would throw him
under the bus like that.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.891
- Well, Connor's
afraid of his dad.
- With good reason.

10:00.975 --> 10:05.354
And we both know Adam can be
a little quick to react.

10:05.438 --> 10:09.150
- [chuckles]
- And in his defense,
his kid did get shot.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.445
- Maybe he'll cool down.
- Maybe.

10:13.321 --> 10:17.033
We should probably plan
an assembly for next week
to talk about it.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.744
Maybe we can combo it
with some gun safety,

10:19.785 --> 10:21.245
- that kind of thing.
- Good idea.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.749
Hey, are we meeting in here?
I got you a...

10:24.832 --> 10:27.543
- Sorry, I thought it was just
the two of us, sorry, Lena.
- No worries.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.963
Actually, I'll meet you
in my office in a minute.
And thank you.

10:31.005 --> 10:35.301
Oh, OK, uh, great.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.599
- Hmmm.
- What?

10:41.682 --> 10:42.850
He never brings me coffee.

10:42.933 --> 10:47.313
He's just trying to make
a good impression. I'm his boss.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.857
- So am I.
- Oh, hush.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.902
I'm sure he just never
thought of it before.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.739
Besides, aren't you more
of a tea drinker anyway?

11:00.993 --> 11:04.163
[dance rock music plays]

11:44.495 --> 11:46.497
- [song ends]
- [applause]

11:46.580 --> 11:48.416
[Mariana]
OK, that was so good!

11:48.457 --> 11:53.379
Oh my God, I'm so excited!
You guys are killing it.
See you tomorrow.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.843
And by the way, thank you
so much for giving us
another chance.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.636
It was really fun,
I'm glad I did.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.725
And just so you know, I meant it
when I said I promise not
to turn into Kaitlyn again.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.979
She really is a girl,
who knew?

12:10.020 --> 12:15.526
And you really are an idiot,
Jack, who knew? Oh, wait,
everybody.

12:20.239 --> 12:24.201
So now I don't know
what I'm looking at,
in terms of probation,

12:24.285 --> 12:26.537
The judge may give me
more time, for all I know.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.415
Yeah, well, it's super
common with foster kids.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.918
So many people have access
to all our personal info,

12:32.960 --> 12:34.962
it's just so easy.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.882
Good news is
you caught it now, you know.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.677
A buddy of mine didn't... he
didn't find out until he'd
already aged out of the system,

12:41.719 --> 12:45.181
and then, by that point,
his credit was so bad
he couldn't get a job,

12:45.264 --> 12:49.894
he couldn't find a place to live
and he ended up on the street.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.230
Sorry, that was...

12:53.272 --> 12:56.817
...that was actually supposed
to make you feel better.
[chuckles]

12:56.901 --> 12:59.487
- I'm not really sure why.
- Mm.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.863
[chuckles]

13:00.905 --> 13:06.285
Look, if there's
anything at all I can do,
let me know, OK?

13:13.876 --> 13:16.504
I... Would you help
that girl.

13:16.587 --> 13:20.508
Um, we know each other
a little bit and we're
not exactly friends.

13:20.591 --> 13:24.261
Uh, yeah,
sure, no problem.

13:25.095 --> 13:28.098
No, that's not gonna work,
this is a time-sensitive
investigation

13:28.182 --> 13:33.687
and I need those credit card
statements emailed to the
address that I gave you today.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.315
Yes, exactly.
Thank you.

13:36.398 --> 13:41.111
What was that about?
Credit trouble? Told you
not to buy that house.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.281
It's not...
Don't worry about it.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.159
Hey, so...

13:47.201 --> 13:50.162
I moved Ana into
her new place this morning,

13:50.246 --> 13:54.708
That's good. I think that's the
right thing, for both of you.

13:54.750 --> 14:00.172
Yeah, no, it's fine, just
I'm not sure this is
the best situation for her.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.008
Mike, you have
gotta let go.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.845
Ana's an adult, she's gotta
make her own decisions.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.556
It's not
your problem anymore.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.016
You can't keep trying
to control everything.

14:11.058 --> 14:16.647
- I realize that, but...
- Mike, I'm sorry,
I've gotta go.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.402
So what did she want?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.654
She just wanted to schedule
a follow-up with her CASA.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.991
I guess she's trying to get out
of her current foster home.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.452
- Is it bad?
- I guess so, yeah.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.582
- What?
- Nothing. Um...

14:34.623 --> 14:37.877
It's just, the foster home
she was in, the one
before this one,

14:37.918 --> 14:39.378
it was pretty awful, too.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.591
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I was in it
before her.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.343
And I'm the one
that got her pulled out.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.681
OK, give it a little gas.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.101
[breaks screech]

14:54.143 --> 14:55.394
[Brandon] Why did I
let you talk me into this.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.271
Well you did, so...

14:57.354 --> 14:58.856
We can stop anytime.

15:00.441 --> 15:04.111
OK, let's try again,
uh, gently.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.615
OK, there you go.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.825
Good job. [chuckles]

15:09.867 --> 15:13.537
You don't always have to keep
your hands at ten and two,
just so you know.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.541
That's not what the experts say.
And they changed it to nine
and three.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.253
OK, well, do you wanna try
speeding up a little?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.797
[engine roars
and brakes screech]

15:23.839 --> 15:26.800
OK, I think that's probably
enough for today.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.803
Maybe, yeah, maybe we should
just go back to the house.

15:29.845 --> 15:34.892
Hey, before we go home,
could we could go
see the Gutierrezes?

15:34.975 --> 15:35.935
What? Why?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.561
To deliver the letter.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.063
But why?

15:39.146 --> 15:43.442
What did you think I was gonna
do with it? It's a letter
from Ana to her parents.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.694
No, I told you
to like to write to them.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.072
I mean...

15:48.113 --> 15:49.156
[sighs]

15:49.198 --> 15:51.033
Look, can't you ask
Moms to take you?

15:51.075 --> 15:55.496
Moms who still haven't
even told me that they're
not adopting the baby?

15:55.579 --> 15:59.166
Yeah, somehow I don't
think that's gonna happen.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.544
What's the big deal? We're just
dropping off some mail.

16:02.628 --> 16:07.633
Think of it as helping me
prepare for a future
career at the Post Office.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.387
Come on, please.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.055
I wanna do it
for the baby.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.308
What do you think
is gonna happen?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.143
I dunno.

16:18.185 --> 16:22.356
Maybe Ana's folks can take her
since Moms aren't gonna.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.485
I just don't want her to end up
with total strangers.

16:26.527 --> 16:30.656
[inhales and exhales deeply]

16:31.573 --> 16:33.409
But I drive, OK?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.081
This it?

16:39.164 --> 16:41.333
Looks nice.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.836
You sure
you're ready for this?

16:43.877 --> 16:47.214
- [man] Gracias. Come again.
- [Latin dance music plays]

16:47.297 --> 16:50.300
[door bell jingles]

16:50.342 --> 16:52.970
Hello, beautiful young people!

16:56.390 --> 16:59.268
Try our pan dulce?
It's fresh.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.686
Oh, no thank you.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.272
[man] Well, suit yourself.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.358
It's the best
in the city.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.780
Um, we're looking
for Mr. or Mrs. Gutierrez?

17:11.864 --> 17:16.492
I'm Mr. Gutierrez.
What can I do for you?

17:19.704 --> 17:23.959
Um... I'm...
My name is Mariana.

17:24.042 --> 17:28.088
This is my brother.
My adopted brother.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.798
I'm Ana's daughter.

17:29.882 --> 17:36.221
Ana was or...
Ana is my birth mother.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.018
I, uh, I have
this letter that she...

17:41.101 --> 17:43.395
The delivery is here, Papa.

17:43.479 --> 17:47.441
- Who's this?
- Um, some kids
looking for jobs.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.528
I was just telling them
that we're not hiring.

17:52.654 --> 17:56.366
Come back in the fall,
everybody stops eating bread
in the summer,

17:56.408 --> 17:59.328
to fit in their bikinis.
[chuckles]

17:59.369 --> 18:00.913
Good luck.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.499
Thank you.

18:12.049 --> 18:16.220
[soft rock music]

18:16.261 --> 18:18.722
Brandon took you driving??

18:19.598 --> 18:20.891
He told you?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.769
Wait, is there
something else?

18:28.565 --> 18:30.818
I met our grandparents.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.444
You did?

18:32.486 --> 18:36.490
I tried to get them
to take Ana's baby, and...

18:36.532 --> 18:38.117
Are they going to?

18:43.914 --> 18:44.998
What were they like?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.960
I dunno.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.880
They wouldn't
even talk to me.

18:53.590 --> 18:57.052
You know, I always wondered
why they didn't come get us...

18:57.636 --> 19:01.181
...when Ana couldn't
take care of us anymore.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.102
Now I guess I know why.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.231
They didn't want
anything to with us.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.819
[mumbles indistinct]
Don't cry.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.573
Whatever.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.200
It is what it is.

19:20.284 --> 19:24.454
I just feel awful
for that little baby.

19:24.496 --> 19:29.293
But what're you gonna do?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.427
So I got your so-called
credit card statements,

19:38.510 --> 19:41.597
and whoever is posing
as you is buying

19:41.680 --> 19:45.517
a bunch of these high end
handbags here in town.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.728
- Those are high end?
- Very.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.605
I have terrible taste.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.442
OK, so they have like
a handbag obsession?
How does that help us?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.485
No, I'm pretty sure they're
not buying them for themselves.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.322
A lot of identity thieves
will buy expensive stuff,

19:58.363 --> 20:00.115
and then resell them
online for cash.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.202
So now that I have the serial
numbers, I will meet
with a few people

20:03.243 --> 20:06.872
that are selling them
on Craigslist, and if
the numbers match,

20:06.955 --> 20:08.999
we've got our thief.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.627
OK, thanks for coming
in early, everybody.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.504
So the Coder's Challenge
is only a few weeks away

20:14.588 --> 20:16.632
and they just released
this year's rules,

20:16.673 --> 20:20.427
the project is to design,
produce, and market

20:20.469 --> 20:22.179
an app to a team
of real investors.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.474
- Hm. Like Shark Tank?
- Yeah, something like that.

20:25.557 --> 20:29.728
so we need to divvy up
the workload and come up
with a concept.

20:29.811 --> 20:33.106
- Why don't me and Mark
and Javi do the coding?
- Any objections?

20:33.190 --> 20:36.526
Jay and me can do any
engineering or building
or whatever.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.322
- OK.
- And why don't Mariana and Emma
do all the marketing and stuff?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.950
Mariana pretty much
coordinated the walkout

20:42.991 --> 20:45.911
for Timothy single-handedly,
she's like a social media
monster.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.580
[chuckles] All right,
that work for you guys?

20:53.460 --> 20:55.087
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:55.128 --> 20:59.633
- How are you?
- I'm OK, as long as I don't
look online or anything.

20:59.675 --> 21:04.054
The kids from school
are calling my dad a psycho
murderer and stuff like that.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.516
- Really?
- Yeah, and he feels
so terrible.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.811
He hasn't even gotten
outta bed today.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.187
How are you?

21:13.063 --> 21:15.357
Connor's dad doesn't want us
to be friends anymore.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.525
For real?

21:16.566 --> 21:19.403
Yeah. Connor told him
the whole thing was my idea,

21:19.486 --> 21:21.321
the sneaking out,
the drinking, all of it.

21:21.405 --> 21:25.575
- Why would he do that?
- I dunno. Especially
since it was your idea.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.161
Well, nobody made you
come with us.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.454
I know.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.291
Way to make me feel
like a jerk, Jude.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.462
I'm sorry.
It wasn't your fault,

21:40.299 --> 21:42.050
Thanks.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.053
So, have you talked
to Connor?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.472
No, he's not answering
my texts or anything.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.309
Maybe his dad
took his phone away?

21:50.350 --> 21:52.894
Maybe,
but I don't get it,

21:52.936 --> 21:56.023
why would Connor tell him
that all of it was my idea?

21:56.064 --> 21:59.443
I'm gonna see him later, you
want me to tell him something?

21:59.526 --> 22:01.653
You are? Why?

22:01.737 --> 22:05.490
My dad and I are going
to the hospital to apologize.

22:05.574 --> 22:10.120
Just ask him why.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.043
[dance rock music plays]

22:20.839 --> 22:25.677
OK, Emma, a little bit more
hips. Gotta do it like this.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.138
Hips, down, up,

22:28.180 --> 22:33.185
one, two, three, four,
pop, pop, pop, pop.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.813
Does it have
to be so sexual?

22:37.356 --> 22:40.192
Well, kinda, yeah.
[chuckles]

22:40.233 --> 22:41.651
Well, it's
kinda degrading.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.363
- What's with you?
- It's just...

22:44.446 --> 22:46.365
I'm not sure that this
is for me.

22:46.406 --> 22:49.743
What? Why?
You've been having so much fun.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.954
I guess I just wanna be taken
seriously and I don't think

22:52.996 --> 22:56.583
anyone is gonna do that if we're
out there, shaking our asses.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.377
Is this because
of the wrestlers?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.212
It's not just them,
it's everybody.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.006
I mean, look what
happened today in STEM.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.217
What happened
today in STEM?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.969
They put us in charge of
marketing and social media.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.555
Yeah, and?
We got put in charge.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.808
It's not like they asked us
to be secretaries or whatever.

23:12.891 --> 23:18.730
Yeah, they put us in charge
of the girl thing. We might
as well be spokesmodels.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.982
What's wrong
with being a spokesmodel?

23:21.024 --> 23:24.486
I'm like the best coder
in there, but suddenly
I'm a joke.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.696
Oh, and you think that's because
you're on the dance team now?

23:26.738 --> 23:27.989
It doesn't help.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.074
We're athletes.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.909
Look, I'm sorry, I just...
I really don't get it.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.913
It's not like you suddenly
became stupider, because
you joined the dance team.

with being sexy?
- Nothing.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.460

be perceived that way.

than just my ass, you know.

the way it is.

this up tomorrow.

to me, ever since I told her
I'm not gonna go on tour.

or you're walking home.

nine and three.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.797
I'll tell you one thing though,
I'm not calling her this time.

24:25.839 --> 24:28.592
She can come to me
when she gets over herself.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.636

That's not how it works.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.972

go on tour without me!

So why am I the bad guy
if I wanna go to Idyllwild?

24:36.057 --> 24:39.060
- 'Cause you slept with her.
- What does that have
to do with anything?

You slept with her,
then you said you didn't
wanna go on tour.

she feels like rejected?

She's not that kinda girl.

kinda girl to get your heart
broken, dumbass.

She left 'em at my place.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.709
Like you said, she's no
longer my responsibility

25:02.751 --> 25:08.298
so if you could take 'em
to her whenever you get
a chance.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.342
OK, thanks. I will.

25:10.383 --> 25:13.386
Why aren't you in uniform?
Where you goin'?

25:13.428 --> 25:15.805

a handbag.

Hey, Sarah.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.696
Hey.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.407
Um, I volunteer here.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.911
Good for you.

25:37.994 --> 25:43.375
Yeah, no, I, um, I hope

in a new foster home.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.709
Me, too.

25:44.751 --> 25:49.923
And, um... I want you to know,
I'm not, like mad about
the trial and all that.

25:49.965 --> 25:54.678
I totally get why you didn't
wanna testify. It was a lot
to ask.

25:57.556 --> 26:03.186
And just let me know if you need
any help or anything, really.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.190
OK, thanks.

- Hey.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.610
I'm here to tutor Jesus.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.862
Oh, um, OK.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.947
I was just leaving.

26:55.989 --> 27:00.243
Jesus isn't here,
but he should come
back soon. You can wait.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.412
OK. Thanks.

27:03.496 --> 27:06.708
Hey, can I ask
you something?

27:06.750 --> 27:09.961
Look, I know that
I'm leaving you hanging,
and I'm really sorry,

27:10.045 --> 27:13.882
but I just don't think
that dance team is for me.

27:13.923 --> 27:18.428
OK, but why not?

it's completely obvious.

nail a turn as when you solve

27:24.100 --> 27:27.103

unsolvable coding problems.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.523
So why are you letting
a bunch of boys decide
what kind of girl you wanna be?

27:30.565 --> 27:31.941
I'm not.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.777
You say, "That's just
the way things are,"

27:33.818 --> 27:36.279
but, no,
I don't accept that.

If things aren't the way
they're supposed to be,

27:38.740 --> 27:41.785
then you have
to change them, right?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.162
What if I told you
I had an idea,

27:44.245 --> 27:46.623

on dance team and prove

27:46.706 --> 27:50.126

the best coder in STEM club?

but you were right.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.462
About what?

28:34.504 --> 28:36.589
Craig asked me out.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.134
- [chuckling] I told you.
- Shh.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.720
No gloating, please.

28:41.761 --> 28:44.180
So, where are you going?

28:44.222 --> 28:47.183
We're not.
I politely declined.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.185
What? Why? He's so cute,

28:49.269 --> 28:52.814
with that vaguely Hawaiian
hang-ten super-chill vibe.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.317
True, but I think
it's probably not a great idea

28:56.401 --> 28:58.319
for me to date
one of my subordinates.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.156
Besides, after my ex-husband,
I have a philosophy about men:

29:01.197 --> 29:05.493
they're like dessert.
When you want one, just think
about it for a minute,

29:05.535 --> 29:09.914
and you'll realize
you're probably
better off going without.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.251
What am I gonna do, huh?

29:13.293 --> 29:15.712
Maybe I should try women.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.215
Oh, trust me,
they're not any easier.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.718
Really? I was sure
they would be.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.887
At least women
know how to communicate.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.054
Not necessarily.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.015
Like my wife.

29:27.056 --> 29:30.351
She has this
almost compulsive need

29:30.393 --> 29:32.729
to keep things to herself.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.648
- And now we're gonna
adopt this baby.
- You are?

29:35.732 --> 29:39.486
And it's the right thing,
I think it's the right thing,
anyway,

29:39.569 --> 29:43.364
but I just hate that we're
making big decisions like this

29:43.448 --> 29:46.618

at our best, you know?

29:49.370 --> 29:51.331

something extra for the kids.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.756
No, I'm sorry,

- Quiet, please.

she was just leaving.

30:12.393 --> 30:15.063
I'm not stupid, Victor.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.693
You look so much like her,
when she was that age.

and the running away.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.313
Yeah.

Oh, my God. That's really nice.
It's not a fake, right?

Nope. No, no, real deal.

right there on the tag.

31:06.364 --> 31:10.869
Yeah, that is beautiful.
How much did you want
for it again?

31:10.910 --> 31:13.079
Four hundred.
It retails for nine.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.664
That's a lot of money.

31:14.747 --> 31:18.585
Pretty bag like that
will look real good
on a pretty lady like you.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.880

- Oh, it was a gift for my mom.

do you?
- No, should I?

And you're under arrest
for fencing stolen goods.

31:45.653 --> 31:49.032
- Mike?!
- Going somewhere?

31:54.078 --> 31:55.955
Not getting to know you
and your brother

31:55.997 --> 31:58.666
is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.001
But I need you to hear me.

32:00.043 --> 32:05.340
We didn't even know that you
existed until it was too late.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.133
Ana never told us.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.011
I think she thought
because she was doing drugs

32:10.094 --> 32:13.848
that we would try
to take you away from her,

32:13.932 --> 32:17.101
but of course,
that's exactly what happened.

32:18.186 --> 32:21.314
Those government people
came and took you,

32:21.356 --> 32:24.025
and by the time
we even heard of you,

32:24.067 --> 32:28.571
it was too late,
you were already adopted.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.950
And when we confronted her,

32:32.033 --> 32:37.872
when we asked her why,
why would she let that happen...

32:38.623 --> 32:43.586
She said she was glad
we couldn't get our hands
on her children,

32:43.628 --> 32:48.591
so we couldn't make
them suffer like she did.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.679
[sighs]

32:52.762 --> 32:55.098
She did a lot
of bad things,

32:56.182 --> 32:57.767
but we always tried,

32:57.850 --> 33:00.269
always forgave her.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.022
[Mrs. Gutierrez]
But not that.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.984
I couldn't forgive that.

33:10.488 --> 33:14.325
Would it change anything
if I told you that Ana was
sober?

33:14.409 --> 33:17.328
- Like really sober?
- [sniffles]

33:17.412 --> 33:21.541
And that maybe now
you have a second chance?

33:27.255 --> 33:28.673

33:31.634 --> 33:33.094

we have a good life.

We're happy, we have a great
family and a great home,
just so you know.

that you should read this.

it's pretty messed up.

38:09.328 --> 38:13.541
I just can't believe that she
still hasn't figured out that
you're just using her,

38:13.582 --> 38:16.836
that you've always
been using her.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.588
I tried to talk
some sense into her,

loves you so much,

And then it occurred to me,
maybe we could check her credit
