WEBVTT

00:02.840 --> 00:04.960
-Are we rolling?
-Yep, in your own time.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.000
[Toast] Is that it? Just that one word?

00:10.080 --> 00:11.240
-Yep.
-[Toast] OK.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.240
Yes!

00:18.040 --> 00:20.720
Uh... Hey, Steven,
that was really good. Um...

00:20.800 --> 00:23.480
Feeling is here that you could be
a bit more positive.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.760
-More positive?
-Yeah. You know, really go for it.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.040
-You want me to go for it?
-Yeah.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.440
All right.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.280
[overenthusiastic] Yes!

00:36.920 --> 00:38.120
[Danny Bear] Very, very good.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.200
Um... Let's try it without the script.
Might loosen you up a little bit.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.440
I mean, what is it, one word?
You don't need it, do you?

00:43.520 --> 00:45.960
I probably don't need the script.
It's just a word.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.680
[Danny Bear] Yep, OK, let's do it again.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.320
Yes!

00:54.800 --> 00:55.840
-Was that it?
-Yes.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.920
Right.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.360
Hi, Steven?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.400
-Yes.
-This is Clem Fandango.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.200
-Yes.
-Can you hear me?

01:04.280 --> 01:06.160
Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.440
Honestly, this is going so great,
but I just think

01:08.520 --> 01:11.400
there was a little loss of energy
on that last take. Maybe try one more.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.320
[sighs]

01:13.400 --> 01:14.760
-OK, ready to go?
-[Toast] Yep.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.080
-What?
-Yes!

01:16.600 --> 01:17.640
OK.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.040
Yes! Yes!

01:21.120 --> 01:24.280
Yes! Yes!

01:24.360 --> 01:25.840
Ye-es!

01:25.920 --> 01:27.600
Ye-e-es!

01:27.680 --> 01:28.720
Ye-e-es!

01:28.800 --> 01:30.280
Ye-e-e-es!

01:30.800 --> 01:32.280
Ye-e-es!

01:32.640 --> 01:36.080
Ye-e-es! Ye-e-es!

01:36.160 --> 01:37.560
[screams] Ye-e-e-es!

01:37.640 --> 01:41.160
[sighs] Fuck... [gasps]

01:41.240 --> 01:42.960
Jesus. [sniffs]

01:43.280 --> 01:44.920
-Steven?
-[shouts] What?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.920
How would you feel about doing a "no"?

02:17.160 --> 02:18.960
[Ellen] Come on, you idiot.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.640
I'm trying to concentrate, Ellen.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.400
It's only fucking crazy golf.
Now, take the shot and move on.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.560
It's not crazy golf, it's mini golf.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.920
What's the fucking difference?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.320
One's crazy and one's mini. It's obvious
what the fucking difference is.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.000
-I'm taking my shot now.
-You can't do that, Ellen.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.800
-It's my shot.
-Why is it your shot?

02:34.880 --> 02:37.240
Because my ball is nearer to the hole.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.200
It's not the fucking US Masters!
Now, I'm going to take my shot.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.800
-You can't do that.
-Don't tell me what to do.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.800
Excuse me? Excuse me?

02:47.440 --> 02:49.240
How long are you gonna be on this hole?

02:49.320 --> 02:53.400
-Mind your own fucking business!
-Yeah! We are actually on this hole.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.760
So, piss off and wait your turn.
Now, give me the club.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.880
Do not take this club, Ellen.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.000
Do not tell me what to do.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.680
[Toast screams]

03:03.760 --> 03:05.880
I really hate it
when you tell me what to do!

03:06.120 --> 03:07.320
[Toast screams]

03:07.400 --> 03:10.320
I really... hate it... when you...

03:10.400 --> 03:14.120
tell me... what... to do!

03:14.200 --> 03:15.440
[Toast groans]

03:15.520 --> 03:17.000
-[Ellen grunts]
-[Toast groans]

03:17.080 --> 03:20.520
-[Ellen grunts]
-[Toast groans]

03:20.600 --> 03:22.800
[Toast cries]

03:24.680 --> 03:27.400
Oh... I really miss her. [sniffs]

03:28.080 --> 03:29.080
Who's that, Toast?

03:29.160 --> 03:32.080
Ellen, my ex-wife. I really miss her.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.320
I thought you said
your marriage was volatile.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
It was.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.840
But we had so much in common.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.920
Straight talker,
never suffered fools gladly.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
She had a terrific sense of humor.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.640
I just got this from her solicitor.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.360
She wants a divorce
and a hell of a lot of cash.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.560
Oh, dear. Are you flush at the moment?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.560
Well, luckily, I've been hired
by a very rich Arab gentleman

03:53.640 --> 03:55.920
to star in a film he's making.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.120
Promised me a tidy sum. We start tomorrow.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.360
Ah, sounds like something
Omar Sharif might be in.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.080
I once played some
surprisingly competitive bridge with Omar.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.720
We had a rubber in his private jacuzzi.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.440
-So, what's the film about?
-[Toast] I don't know.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.720
I haven't been sent a script. Huge budget.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.560
Could be a big break for me.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.440
OK. I'm gonna ask you

04:19.519 --> 04:21.480
if you recognize
any of these photographs.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.440
We think the murderer
may be one of these men.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.360
Is this him?

04:27.680 --> 04:29.080
Is this him?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.120
Is this him?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.200
Is this him?

04:35.760 --> 04:37.120
Yes, just as I thought.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.960
And when he attacked you,

04:39.040 --> 04:41.560
did he make an unsavory, racial comment?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.520
Yes. No surprises there.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.360
He's got form on that one.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.080
All right, Mr. Ho Chi, you can go.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.760
[man over megaphone]  Stop acting!

04:53.280 --> 04:55.480
Very good. You get him, Toast, eh!

04:56.560 --> 04:59.120
You nail the bloody fucker.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.840
I just do whatever it says
in the script, Mr. Fasili.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.360
Prince Philip. I hate him!

05:03.440 --> 05:05.040
It's clear from this you're not a fan.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.920
Very good shooting today, Toast.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.760
You know,
I've never directed a film before,

05:11.840 --> 05:14.120
but I think
I'm pretty darn good at it, yes?

05:14.960 --> 05:15.960
Mm... Right.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.760
We win Oscars, I think, or BAFTA awards.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.000
Ah, I show this Prince Philip character.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.200
I hate him.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.000
I hate him. Hate him! Hate him! Hate him!
Hate him! Hate him! Hate him!

05:25.080 --> 05:28.360
Hate him! Hate him! Hate him! Hate him!
Hate him! Hate him! Hate him! Hate him!

05:29.680 --> 05:32.480
[breathes heavily]

05:36.400 --> 05:38.440
Do you think I could get a sandwich?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.520
[Toast] It's fucking terrible.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.760
He's never directed before,
never written a script

05:45.840 --> 05:47.160
and he hasn't got a chance in hell

05:47.240 --> 05:50.040
of getting this film shown
in any decent cinema in the world.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.920
It's obviously a vanity project.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.440
It's good money though, Toast!

05:53.520 --> 05:56.640
The man's a billionaire.
That's like a really wealthy millionaire.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.400
Besides, you don't really want
anyone to see the film, do you?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.400
-Well, of course I don't.
-Well then.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.440
Yeah, but I bloody well should be
starring in films people want to see,

06:05.520 --> 06:07.120
made by proper directors.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.520
Something like  The King's Speech.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.040
I'm not saying you're not good enough
to bag an Academy Award, Toast,

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
I'm just...

06:23.280 --> 06:26.520
I just... don't think
it's ever possible you'll win one.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.120
-Because of what I said to Minnie Driver?
-Yes.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.080
Because I told Minnie Driver
she had a big face?

06:36.160 --> 06:39.600
Because you told Minnie Driver she has
a big face, yes. She's in Hollywood now.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.120
She has lots of contacts.
She won't forget that.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.600
And then, the Fassbender debacle.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.240
Oh, everyone knows Fassbender's...

06:46.320 --> 06:49.440
-[horse neighs]
-[chiming and squeaking]

06:50.520 --> 06:53.720
Really, Toast! Spreading a vile rumor!

06:53.800 --> 06:55.200
I saw the photo of the chalet!

06:55.280 --> 06:58.520
He's a major player.
He could crush you like that.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
[sound of can crushing]

07:01.240 --> 07:04.200
Now you're getting paid a lot for
this film, it means you may not have to do

07:04.280 --> 07:05.920
the television advert for the laxative.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.680
There's no way I'm doing a laxative ad.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.680
You remember what happened
to Derek Sibling.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.680
No, I don't actually.
Whatever did happen to Derek Sibling?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.080
He was very good...

07:14.160 --> 07:16.320
He was. Brightest in his year at RADA.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.840
Trod out one of the best Henry Vs
this fella's ever seen.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.280
All going well for him,

07:21.360 --> 07:24.920
then he bursts onto the television
clutching his guts for a laxative ad.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.240
-Then...
-[snap]

07:26.320 --> 07:27.840
...Goodnight Sweetheart.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.200
Takes a very brave actor
to promote a laxative. Money's great.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.080
Martin from the agency
would still like to meet you.

07:36.520 --> 07:37.960
You're obviously not keen,

07:38.040 --> 07:41.440
but meet him anyway. It'll be very casual.
He's suggested you go bowling together.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.400
-Bowling?
-Yes, bowling.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.200
You have a big black ball
and you throw it at skittles.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.680
-Skittles?
-Yes, skittles.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.920
They... get knocked over,
the mechanical machine puts them back,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.120
and then you have another go
at hitting them.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.560
-I think you're wrong there, Jane.
-I don't think so!

07:58.640 --> 08:01.640
-You're confusing it with another game.
-I think you should do this.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.920
It's just an informal meeting
with bowling.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.120
-No obligation.
-All right!

08:09.440 --> 08:13.040
What? You can't stop for petrol
during a fare, you prat.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.080
I'm sorry, mate,
I meant to get it earlier.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.560
For fuck's sake!

08:17.640 --> 08:18.760
[car door slams]

08:19.720 --> 08:21.840
Hang on,
he's not lighting a cigarette? Right...

08:24.760 --> 08:28.880
You can't smoke around petrol.
The place will go up like Worzel Gummidge!

08:28.960 --> 08:30.880
Oi! You're in that play, ain't ya?

08:30.960 --> 08:33.159
Oh, God! Jesus!

08:33.240 --> 08:35.039
I went to see that play
with a mate of mine.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.039
You ought to be
a-fucking-shamed of yourself.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.760
Oi, get back there!

08:39.840 --> 08:43.440
There's no need for the theater
in this country to descend to that level.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.200
-Are you finished?
-No, get back.

08:45.280 --> 08:49.320
Sex, nudity, bad language. Disgusting!

08:49.400 --> 08:52.200
Next time, I'll put a fucking match to ya!

08:59.200 --> 09:01.080
I'll burn ya bollocks off!

09:03.040 --> 09:04.760
Goodnight, sweet Prince.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.600
This is awful, having all your boxes here.
When are you gonna move them?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.800
I'll take some today,
but I'll have to hire a van.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.480
Why do you have to write your name
on them?

09:31.560 --> 09:33.120
I don't know. They might get lost.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.120
Well, Ricky is moving in next week,

09:35.200 --> 09:37.080
so he won't want all your stuff there.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.480
-[mutters] Yeah, well, Ricky is a cunt.
-I beg your pardon?

09:39.560 --> 09:42.640
I said I think
I may have my hat on back to front.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.000
You don't like Ricky, do you?

09:44.080 --> 09:47.280
Oh, come on, Ellen. He's a builder
and you're 45th in line for the throne.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.960
You're such a snob.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.520
I'm a snob and he's a yob.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.720
And you are a knob.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.360
-Ricky cares about me. And he's fit.
-What?

09:56.440 --> 09:57.920
He's fit.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.640
You mean he has
a high level of physical fitness?

10:00.720 --> 10:03.360
-No, I mean he's good looking.
-[snorts]

10:03.440 --> 10:05.480
-Why are you wearing that uniform?
-It's a costume.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.680
I had to change.
Someone poured petrol on me earlier.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.160
It's because of
that ghastly play you're in, isn't it?

10:10.240 --> 10:11.720
You should be grateful I'm working.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.920
You're fleecing me
with that divorce settlement.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.600
I'm only getting what I'm due.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.400
Ricky, darling.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.880
[smooching noises]

10:20.960 --> 10:23.120
Give us those... put them in the fridge.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.800
Come here, you gorgeous thing...
Mmm... [chuckles]

10:27.880 --> 10:29.120
Mmm... [kissing noises]

10:29.200 --> 10:31.280
[Ellen giggles] Mmm...

10:31.360 --> 10:34.200
Mmm...

10:36.920 --> 10:37.920
[Ellen chuckles]

10:42.920 --> 10:44.080
Yeah, all right!

10:47.520 --> 10:49.240
[bowling pins clatter]

10:50.520 --> 10:53.840
-Ah, Steven. I'm Martin Aynuss.
-[unenthusiastic] All right.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.880
Hope you don't mind, but I also
brought along my assistant, Sheryl Whelk.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.840
-OK.
-You're dressed very smartly.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.200
Have you just stepped ashore?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.640
It's a costume.
Someone poured petrol on me earlier.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.680
Oh, right. Would you like to start?

11:04.760 --> 11:07.760
Yeah. Let's not toss for it,
or any of that bullshit...

11:27.680 --> 11:30.600
[Toast] I've not played in a while.
Somebody must have changed the rules.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.360
-What are those things at the end?
-They're skittles.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.240
Why are there skittles?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.160
And shouldn't I be stood on grass?

11:37.880 --> 11:39.840
I think what may have happened here is

11:39.920 --> 11:42.400
you've confused
ten-pin bowling with bowls.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.440
-OK.
-It's just a bigger ball, that's all.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.320
If you wanna roll this one towards
the skittles down the end of the lane?

11:48.400 --> 11:49.400
Give that a go.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.600
I presume it's underarm?

12:03.840 --> 12:05.880
[fanfare]

12:05.960 --> 12:06.960
More like that?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.040
[music]

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
[Martin groans]

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
[Toast mutters] Shit!

12:29.640 --> 12:30.640
Twenty-four, take four.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.400
Start acting!

12:34.920 --> 12:37.480
There's something very dodgy
going on here.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.280
Which is your real name?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.560
Prince Philip
or the Duke of Edinburgh?

12:41.640 --> 12:45.400
[Prince Philip] I say!
This is rather unsatisfactory...

12:45.480 --> 12:48.120
For most people one name is enough,
but not for you.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.520
[Prince Philip] How dare you?

12:49.600 --> 12:52.040
Look, Duke... we all know
you're the murderer.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.280
Your life of privilege

12:54.360 --> 12:58.080
and being carried around by servants
won't save you now.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.280
Casual racism is one thing,

13:00.360 --> 13:04.000
but this time, you've bitten off
more than you can chew.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.200
-Are you finished with my husband?
-Get her out of here!

13:13.320 --> 13:17.720
[Jane] Uptight, uncomfortable,
self-conscious.

13:17.800 --> 13:21.320
They say you're the perfect man
to front their Lax-A-Daisy campaign.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.240
-I'm not doing it.
-Such a shame.

13:24.320 --> 13:28.800
You play constipation so beautifully.
They really want you.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.880
Who else did they ask? Portillo?

13:31.960 --> 13:33.520
-Portillo, yes.
-Obvious choice.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.800
He turned them down.
He's off doing his train journeys.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.160
You're not going to
trap me into this, Jane.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.480
I'm not going to advertise laxatives.
Remember Derek Sibling?

13:41.560 --> 13:44.440
Yes, Derek Sibling.
Now, he was very good.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.200
Brightest in his year at RADA.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.720
Trod out one of the best Henry Vs

13:47.800 --> 13:49.200
this fella's ever seen.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.920
All going well for him,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
then he bursts onto the TV
clutching his guts advertising laxatives.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.440
-Then...
-[snap]

13:57.520 --> 13:58.800
...Goodnight Sweetheart!

14:00.160 --> 14:01.640
All right, I'll let them know.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.400
Anyway, I don't need the money.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.320
I've got that film thing.
Last day tomorrow.

14:06.960 --> 14:11.200
Can't wait to lodge that big, fat check
in Barclays of Fitzroy Square!

14:11.280 --> 14:13.520
-Oh yeah... Whoa!
-[thud]

14:15.160 --> 14:16.160
[Jane] Toast?

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
Toast.

14:32.240 --> 14:37.360
I think it's safe to say, Mr. Fasili,
that justice is being done here today.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.640
Yes, Inspector Cavendish.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.280
He has paid the full price for murder.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.000
-I'm not surprised it--
-Also, for standing in the way

14:45.080 --> 14:46.600
of my British citizenship.

14:47.520 --> 14:52.480
The fiend is surely getting
what he so richly deserves. Look at him!

14:52.880 --> 14:55.880
Dying in a cowardly fashion,
like a dog!

14:55.960 --> 14:58.760
I'm not surprised to see him
begging for his life

14:58.840 --> 15:01.360
in such a pathetic, unmanly manner.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.320
The royal family has no place
in modern British society.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.000
I spit on them! [spits]

15:06.080 --> 15:08.960
[Toast] I admire you for saying so,
Mr. Fasili.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.520
They are a bunch of
no-good, cheap bastards.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.320

I'm glad that we compromised

17:05.599 --> 17:08.520
"Cocksuckers" didn't seem right,
not for the entire royal family.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.520
I mean, Princess Michael of Kent...

17:10.599 --> 17:14.400
Well... It's a pity you missed
the Benedict Cumberbatch scenes.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.040
-He was... sublime.
-Who?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.640
I do so love champagne, don't you?

17:20.720 --> 17:22.800
Yes, uh, Mr. Fasili,
I wonder if I could ask you,

17:22.880 --> 17:25.520
-when will I receive payment?
-Now.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.400
-You have the check?
-Yes.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.000
-Could I just--
-I just need to sign it.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.080
Do you have a pen?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.960
-No.
-You are in rather a hurry.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.280
I'm in the middle of
an acrimonious divorce settlement.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.440
I completely understand.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.840
I have a pen in my office,
I shall sign it immediately.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.960
After all, you are the man
who brought Prince Philip to justice.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.280
[laughs nervously]

17:53.680 --> 17:54.800
[continues laughing]

17:54.880 --> 17:57.200
[chuckles] I shall be back in a minute.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.280
Help yourself to more champagne, Toast.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.120

18:07.360 --> 18:08.520

18:08.600 --> 18:09.760
-[women scream]
-Oh, God.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.200
[Toast] Out of my way. Come on.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.720
Mr. Fasili? Where are you?

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
Did you sign the check?

18:17.480 --> 18:21.120
You there, did you see him sign
the check before he fell overboard?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.840
Did you see him sign the check?

18:24.120 --> 18:27.480
Damn you to hell! [voice echoes]

18:29.200 --> 18:31.000
[Ed] It mentions the film.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.560
-Says it may now never get released.
-Well, I don't mind that so much.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.800
-It's not being paid the 60,000.
-It's not being paid the 60,000.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.840
Jane's gonna look into it, but she's not
hopeful. It seems he owes millions.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.080
These things always surface
after someone dies.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.920
Someone who won't be surfacing is Fasili.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.120
-He weighed a ton.
-Sank like a stone.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.960
Apparently, he had an extra large lifebuoy
in case he fell overboard.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.880
He managed to squeeze into that
and still sank.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.800
-Dragged the lifebuoy down with him.
-Really?

18:53.880 --> 18:57.400
I mean, I'd have thought that impossible.
But there again, he was fucking huge.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.560
Thing is, Ellen's been pestering me
for that divorce settlement money.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.760
Tough times, Toast,

19:03.840 --> 19:07.280
but I'm sure you have absolutely nothing
to be worried about.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.880
[man] You better sort that cash out
as soon as possible!

19:13.240 --> 19:14.440
Who are you again?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.840
Because I don't recognize you
from my wife's legal team.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.800
Never mind who we are.
You'd better pay up!

19:19.280 --> 19:22.080
-You're not connected to Ricky, are you?
-No.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.000
It's just that I saw you
jump out of his van.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.280
No. We don't know anyone called Ricky.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.440
-Hang on. You're in that play, ain't ya?
-What?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.080
Remember that play we went to with Dave?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.200
Young Simon here, first time
he's ever been to the theater

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
and sees that rubbish.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.720
You may have put him off
the theater for life.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.080
Pinter, Stoppard, David Hare.
He's never gonna give 'em a chance.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.360
Well, there's been extensive rewrites...
by Ben Elton.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.120
I should give you a bloody good hiding
for that play alone!

19:53.200 --> 19:54.640
But if you don't sort that wonga out,

19:54.720 --> 19:57.640
Ben Elton will be rewriting
your bloody obituary.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.320
So you better get that money, right?

19:59.400 --> 20:03.400
-Doesn't matter how, just get that money!
-Ye-e-es.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.880
[Toast]  Put constipation behind you.

20:07.960 --> 20:13.880
New formula Lax-A-Daisy
restores your body's regularity,

20:13.960 --> 20:15.400
so that you can work

20:15.480 --> 20:18.720
and relax every day, without anxiety.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.120
[glasses chink]

20:20.760 --> 20:25.720
Lax-A-Daisy doesn't cause
excess gas or dizziness.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.640
It just lets you step back

20:27.720 --> 20:30.440
into the natural rhythm of life.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.560
[laughs]

20:39.320 --> 20:41.360
-Yes, very good, Steven.
-Bravo.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.920
[Martin] I wasn't sure about the wig
at first, but it works.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.320
May I introduce you to Howard Bugowitz,
chairman of Lax-A-Daisy in New York?

20:47.400 --> 20:49.120
My God, that was terrific!

20:49.520 --> 20:52.720
Everyone at Cartwright and Aynuss
is very pleased.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.800
We'd like to sign you up
for a long-term contract,

20:54.880 --> 20:56.280
to be the face of Lax-A-Daisy

20:56.360 --> 20:57.840
for the next five years.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.120
Well, that's tremendous news!

21:00.200 --> 21:02.240
Maybe we could even make it ten years?

21:02.320 --> 21:04.840
-We can talk figures on Monday, Jane.
-Perfect.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.120
I'm sure Martin will make us
a very generous offer, Toast.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.920
I don't want to talk about this now.
I've got to rush off and do my play.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.560
Oh no, no, no. Come upstairs.
We're going to have a bit of a party.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.320
No. Last party I went to, someone drowned.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.600
-Come on, we can share a taxi.
-Yes, um... talk Monday.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.040
Great casting, Marty.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.400
That guy really has a bung up his ass!

21:28.560 --> 21:33.160
-Anyone could have played that role.
-No, no, no. You were perfect.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.360
It's a bloody long way
from  The King's Speech.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.560
Pull over here, please.

21:38.320 --> 21:42.760
-[Jane] I don't have any cash, Toast.
-[Toast] Oh, for Pete's sake, Jane.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.880
There's an extra 20 to take her home.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.200
[woman] Oh dear, I think he's died.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.240
Does anybody know anything about him?

21:55.320 --> 21:56.320
Let me through.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.480
Yes.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.720
I know him,
though I haven't seen him in some time.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.880
It's the actor, Derek Sibling.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.880
The brightest in his year at RADA.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.040

this fella's ever seen.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.760
All going well for him,

22:11.840 --> 22:16.600
then he bursts on the television
clutching his guts in a laxative ad.

There was an incident outside.

Tramp dead on the pavement.
I knew him, actually. Derek Sibling.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.960
-Derek Sibling, the actor?
-Yes.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.760
Wasn't he supposed to be very good?

22:37.840 --> 22:41.000
Very good? Brightest in his year at RADA.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.920
Trod out one of the best...

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I won't bore you with the detail.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.600
-cut short by one fatal decision.
-Oh?

22:48.680 --> 22:50.640
Strangely fitting grand finale,
you might say.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.920
What do you mean, Mr. Toast?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.600
He shat himself.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.960
-Yeah!
