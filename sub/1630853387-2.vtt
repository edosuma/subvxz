WEBVTT

00:57.015 --> 01:00.269
It's all right.
Michael can't hurt you anymore.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.373
I'm sorry
for your family's loss.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.001
-If you need anything, please let us know.
-Thank you.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.631
I'm so sorry.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.225
I'm so sorry.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.831
Time to go home?

02:45.374 --> 02:48.043
Aldwinter. Stella's told me
there's a cottage for rent.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.545
What?

02:51.505 --> 02:55.676
Cora, you saw a girl
washed up in her sister's arms.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.929
-Why would you want to go back?
-I have to know what's out there.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.516
And you want to stay in Essex, don't you?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.977
No, I hate fresh air.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.441
It might be fun
to live in a cottage for a while.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.196
I could go home and pick up your things.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.074
Buy more Sherlock too.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.206
I'll need the train fare.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.043
Of course.
And if you incur other expenses,

03:30.127 --> 03:32.004
-I'm happy to--
-I can look after myself.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.344
Just come back to London.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.722
I'm really sorry, Luke. I can't.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.307
You're in shock.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.643
Once we are back in London,
you will start to feel yourself again.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.230
-I'm myself now.
-No, no. Trust me, I've seen this before.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.150
-This? Wh--
-Yes.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.986
Anxiety in a female. This compulsion
to return to the scene of the trauma.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.571
-I'm returning to help.
-What do you mean?

03:57.654 --> 04:00.866
I can talk to people.
Offer them a rational explanation.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.993
You want to tell them
your plesiosaur theory? Now?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.953
Cora, a young girl has died.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.831
-I really think that--
-What? I should give up on my ideas?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.917
I don't see you doing that.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.878
-I'm a qualified doctor.
-And I'm not your patient.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.845
Will you write?

04:24.681 --> 04:25.807
Of course I will.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.153
-To the train station.
-Yes, sir.

05:56.899 --> 05:57.941
It's small.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.611
It's bigger than the pub.
You can have your own room here.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.487
I had my own room in London.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.544
Any good?

06:18.754 --> 06:20.130
Would you recommend it?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.091
I would.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.427
Listen to this.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.640
"All that is solid melts into air.
All that is sacred is profaned."

06:32.100 --> 06:33.310
Shakespeare?

06:34.269 --> 06:35.604
Karl Marx.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.898
The Communist Manifesto, I believe.

06:40.442 --> 06:44.071
How did you become so radical?

06:46.323 --> 06:47.991
I was born in Bethnal Green.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.496
When everything around you is broken,
you look for new ideas.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.999
So how does Cora cope
with a raging socialist in her home?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.960
We're not so different, she and I.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.878
In her grand town house.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.380
That came with her husband.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.132
-Along with her jewels?
-She's given them all away.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.096
So you're close?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.056
Yes, you could say that.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.267
-She confides in you?
-Sometimes.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.768
About matters of the heart?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.941
Well-- I mean--

07:21.942 --> 07:24.778
-Do you think she'll--
-Do you think she'll stay in Essex long?

07:27.239 --> 07:28.490
I don't know.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.493
Cora does what Cora wants from now on.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.746
-Does she now?
-As you do, I'm sure, Dr. Garrett.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.529
Oh. Where did you find her?

08:07.613 --> 08:10.032
Just outside. Can I keep her?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.327
Until we find out
who she belongs to.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.121
What else did you see?

08:16.205 --> 08:18.207
Lots of people who were wearing black.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.445
-Henry.
-Have you heard what they're saying?

08:48.529 --> 08:49.613
No.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.367
Gracie was taken for her sins.

08:55.452 --> 09:00.040
No, Henry, no. No, she drowned. All right?

09:00.832 --> 09:02.835
It was an accident. A tragic accident.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.633
God will look after her now.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.891
As we must look after Naomi.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.949
What can I do?

09:46.628 --> 09:47.963
Shall I sing for you?

09:49.173 --> 09:51.425
-Let me sing for you.
-Okay.

10:04.605 --> 10:11.111
Down in yon forest there stands a hall

10:11.195 --> 10:16.700
The bells of Paradise
I heard them ring

10:16.783 --> 10:22.915
It's covered all over
With purple and pall

10:22.998 --> 10:29.421
It's covered all over
With purple and pall

10:33.217 --> 10:39.056
In the hall there stands a bed

10:39.139 --> 10:44.978
The bells of Paradise
I heard them ring

10:45.062 --> 10:51.068
It's covered all over
With scarlet so red

10:51.151 --> 10:57.950
It's covered all over
With scarlet so red

11:01.620 --> 11:05.791
Under the bed there runs--

11:20.013 --> 11:21.181
Sorry.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.100
The one half runs water

11:23.183 --> 11:25.394
Why on earth is she still here?

11:25.477 --> 11:28.146
The other runs blood

11:28.230 --> 11:33.110
One half runs water
The other runs blood…

11:33.193 --> 11:34.486
Mrs. Seaborne.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.531
-Cora.
-I only came to pay my respects.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.575
I'm sorry if I upset people.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.212
Stella and I,
we didn't think you'd come back.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.300
Well, I thought I could help.
Be a voice of reason.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.303
-How?
-Well, I could explain things.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.723
No, you came for your serpent.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.645
I should go.
Frankie's unpacking.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.481
I'll walk you back.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.029
I'm not here to make trouble, Will.

12:17.112 --> 12:20.866
But you want to look
into things, ask questions.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.576
I'd like to.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.247
People are scared,
you need to be careful.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.373
Yes, of course.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.334
But Stella will be keen to see you.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.294
Come over once you're settled?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.795
I'd like that.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.676
I hope you don't disapprove of my coming.

12:41.053 --> 12:46.141
Well, you're trying to understand,
trying to find the truth.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.603
I approve of that.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.004
Will your servant
still be up to look after you?

13:16.505 --> 13:18.131
I am the servant.

13:18.924 --> 13:23.220
-Of course. Silly me. I'm--
-I'm-- I'm teasing, Spencer.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.937
Maureen, what is it?

13:32.020 --> 13:33.063
An explosion at the arsenal.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.732
I think one of the casualties
has a pericardial tear.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.318
-Is he young?
-Yes. And strong, fit.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.654
Come on then.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.197
Here we go again.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.870
May I ask you a favor?

13:50.956 --> 13:54.793
He'll be all right, Doctor.
You see, hardly any blood.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.428
I think there is a tear in the sack
around your brother's heart.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.263
He is bleeding…

14:07.890 --> 14:10.517
internally. Very fast.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.811
We must operate straightaway.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.690
O-On his heart?
Is-- Is that safe?

14:16.773 --> 14:19.526
I have to be honest with you.
Last time I tried this, I failed.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.445
But in medicine
there is always a first time,

14:21.528 --> 14:23.822
and your brother will be dead
by the morning without it.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.115
This is his only hope.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.619
Prepare the mask.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.371
You should wait outside.
My friend will sit with you.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.797
Please, do your best.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.300
Come on.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.848
Beautiful.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.145
Is there anyone I can get word to? Family?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.649
Nev and I came from India last year.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.193
We know no one here.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.659
What brought you to London?

15:11.495 --> 15:13.455
We came with a British family.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.668
I was their ayah and Nev their tutor.

15:19.169 --> 15:23.006
But, they changed their mind
when we arrived.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.009
Let us go.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.347
I'm sorry.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.395
Scissors.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.360
Clips.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.333
You ready?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.263
Needle.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.723
The swab.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.540
Scissors.

16:50.594 --> 16:54.264
The wound's intact…
for now. Let's close his chest up.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.725
We need to wait
for him to come round.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.675
It must have reopened.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.054
Give him time.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.534
He's coming round.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.125
Luke.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.003
Luke.

18:10.549 --> 18:13.260
It's gone really well.
Everything's fine. Just relax.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.095
Hi, Nev.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.185
I was just by St. Paul's,

18:22.978 --> 18:26.064
wondering… how the dome stays up.

18:27.691 --> 18:31.153
If you'll excuse me,
I must find Mr. Garrett.

18:40.871 --> 18:41.997
Luke?

18:45.083 --> 18:46.460
Luke.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.628
What are you doing?

18:48.295 --> 18:51.465
I thought I could… I never knew.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.302
I never doubted it for a second.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.450
Come in.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.997
I brought these.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.290
Thank you.

19:26.083 --> 19:30.254
I'm sorry if I intruded yesterday.
I just wanted to offer my condolences.

19:31.171 --> 19:35.175
I've taken the cottage next door, so if
there's anything I could do to help.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.971
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.100
My own husband died recently, but…

19:46.019 --> 19:47.271
to lose a daughter--

19:47.354 --> 19:50.357
You're right. It's not natural.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.739
-Do you think there's something out there?
-I think you should go.

20:08.834 --> 20:13.964
That chicken that your son's got…
it belongs to old Cracknell.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.507
Out in the marshes.

20:15.591 --> 20:16.758
Thank you.

21:18.237 --> 21:20.739
-Afternoon, Mrs. Seaborne.
-Hello.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.076
-What do you want with Cracknell?
-We have his chicken.

21:24.159 --> 21:25.452
Be careful.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.120
What do you mean?

21:27.871 --> 21:29.039
He doesn't go to church.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.624
We don't go to church.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.390
Hello.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.766
Mr. Cracknell?

21:49.226 --> 21:51.395
The serpent-loving newcomers.

21:52.062 --> 21:53.564
And that's my chicken.

21:53.647 --> 21:56.608
I'm sorry. I hope
you didn't think it had been stolen.

21:56.692 --> 21:58.151
By some beast?

21:59.945 --> 22:02.155
Do you believe
there's something out there?

22:02.239 --> 22:04.533
It's not a question
of belief for me.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.744
-In the coop.
-You've got evidence?

22:09.746 --> 22:11.874
What I mean is,
if you don't believe in God,

22:11.957 --> 22:13.792
you can't believe in the devil either.

22:15.294 --> 22:17.129
So what do you think happened
to Gracie Banks?

22:19.131 --> 22:21.592
Someone dies on the marshes every year.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.428
Gets caught out by the tide.

22:25.929 --> 22:29.892
Have you ever seen anything out of
the ordinary? A sea creature?

22:29.975 --> 22:32.686
Not yet. Eels, seals.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.688
But no monster.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.316
Excuse me, Mr. Cracknell.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.026
What are their names?

22:39.693 --> 22:41.987
Gog and Magog.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.115
Just my joke.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.618
You wanna feed 'em young'un?

22:54.750 --> 22:55.751
There you go.

22:58.128 --> 23:00.422
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.149
Can I tell you something, Father?

23:20.025 --> 23:21.151
'Course you can.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.740
I saw the serpent.

23:30.077 --> 23:31.453
Are you sure?

23:33.830 --> 23:35.457
Now I see it at night too.

23:38.544 --> 23:40.712
In the shadows like it's waiting for me.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.506
-No, Naomi.
-I do.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.551
I can feel it.

23:45.634 --> 23:46.802
It's just…

23:49.012 --> 23:51.849
…at night that we let our fears take hold.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.296
-Hello, Stella.
-Hello.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.464
Hello.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.008
How nice to see you.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.552
How are you all? How are the children?

24:29.261 --> 24:30.387
Still a little on edge.

24:32.014 --> 24:33.015
Come on in.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.143
Cora. Frankie.

24:38.312 --> 24:39.354
What are you doing?

24:39.438 --> 24:42.649
-Science. It's so dull.
-At least you get to do it.

24:43.817 --> 24:44.902
Girls don't do science?

24:44.985 --> 24:48.614
We all need science
to help us understand the world.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.034
Could you give us a lesson?
Tell everyone why you're here?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.330
I'd be very happy to.
I could bring my fossils.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.917
-If you think it's a good idea?
-I don't see why not.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.295
-I'll ask Will to arrange it.
-Where is Will, anyway?

25:03.378 --> 25:04.379
In his study.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.048
I'll go and say hello.

25:12.179 --> 25:13.430
Mrs. Seaborne.

25:13.514 --> 25:15.682
Cora. I--

25:15.766 --> 25:18.560
I never thought
a country vicar would be so well-read.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.814
What a shocking lack of imagination.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.533
What are you doing here, Will?

25:32.616 --> 25:33.617
What do you mean?

25:34.785 --> 25:37.996
Well, a man like you
out here on the marshes.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.835
I might ask the same of you.

25:45.504 --> 25:49.383
Look what I found on my morning walk.

25:51.051 --> 25:53.011
I didn't have you down
as a collector.

25:53.095 --> 25:57.391
Well, you inspired me
to look down as well as up.

26:01.186 --> 26:03.689
What is it? Any ideas?

26:05.274 --> 26:07.109
It's some sort of lobster.

26:08.485 --> 26:12.281
Hoploparia or--
Where did you find it?

26:12.364 --> 26:16.326
Up by the cliffs at St. Osyth.
I could show you one day.

26:16.410 --> 26:17.411
Thank you.

26:22.124 --> 26:23.125
Keep it.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.005
I'll join in a moment. I'll just…

26:30.841 --> 26:32.301
And what's that one?

26:33.051 --> 26:35.095
That's a strange color, isn't it?

26:35.179 --> 26:36.889
We're sharing our treasure.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.058
If that's all right?

26:42.936 --> 26:43.979
Of course it is.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.902
I found this one by the River Thames.

26:49.985 --> 26:53.989
Really? Well, I think it's my favorite.

26:58.076 --> 26:59.620
When's Martha coming back?

27:00.162 --> 27:01.455
Soon, I hope.

27:06.210 --> 27:09.463
"Mr. Luke Garrett has performed

27:09.546 --> 27:12.883
-the first pericardial surgery…"
-We know.

27:12.966 --> 27:16.803
"…at Borough Hospital, London.

27:16.887 --> 27:21.308
Mr. Garrett's lifesaving,
or some of us might say miraculous…"

27:21.391 --> 27:23.727
-Miraculous?
-Oh, shut up, Garrett.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.481
"… feat of surgery
should not be underestimated.

27:27.564 --> 27:31.276
It may expand, not just the boundaries
of medical science…"

27:31.360 --> 27:34.530
What are you doing here?
Not that it's not a pleasure to see you.

27:34.613 --> 27:37.157
Well, Dr. Garrett
may have performed a miracle.

27:37.241 --> 27:39.076
He might actually be Jesus Christ himself,

27:39.159 --> 27:41.828
but show me the patient
who can recover without good food.

27:41.912 --> 27:43.372
I'll come with you.

27:44.081 --> 27:47.251
Mr. Garrett takes all the glory.
I'm left to follow up.

27:48.252 --> 27:51.630
"This is a first-class contribution to"…

27:58.971 --> 28:01.598
"For she was one
who worked easily at her…"

28:01.682 --> 28:03.016
You look much better.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.977
Thank you, Doctor.

28:05.060 --> 28:08.146
It's Mr. Garrett you should thank,
if you ever see him.

28:08.230 --> 28:10.941
If I can have a quick look at the wound?

28:22.661 --> 28:24.997
-Thank you.
-I was baking anyway.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.415
That's very kind.

28:28.917 --> 28:32.045
My own brother fell sick
when I was your age. It's a struggle.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.547
Your parents weren't around either?

28:35.716 --> 28:38.427
It's all right.
It's a long time ago now. Ten years.

28:40.762 --> 28:45.851
-Your brother's all right now?
-No. Typhus. He never…

28:45.934 --> 28:47.227
I'm so sorry.

28:49.438 --> 28:50.981
I'm lucky in many ways.

28:51.064 --> 28:53.192
I have a good job now and a home.

28:56.445 --> 28:59.656
You'd think he'd be a bit more cheerful
at the thought of going home.

29:00.407 --> 29:03.702
When you give him a long list of medicine
and insist he take a month off work?

29:03.785 --> 29:04.870
Minimum.

29:05.495 --> 29:06.955
So how will they pay their rent?

29:07.831 --> 29:09.458
You think they'll be evicted?

29:09.541 --> 29:13.253
Of course not. He'll be packing gunpowder
again first thing Monday morning.

29:13.337 --> 29:16.215
No. No, Martha.
That'll endanger his recovery.

29:16.298 --> 29:17.841
He needs to be told.

29:17.925 --> 29:21.178
What? That he can't win?
Shall I tell him or will you?

29:32.564 --> 29:34.316
I suppose if I played my cards right,

29:34.399 --> 29:38.570
I could be sitting in a backbench,
debating some minor point of law.

29:39.655 --> 29:44.117
But really, I--
I'd rather spend my time

29:45.369 --> 29:48.413
guiding Cracknell back to the God
who never left him.

29:49.915 --> 29:50.958
Or…

29:53.085 --> 29:58.549
What I really wanted was purpose,
not achievement.

29:59.341 --> 30:00.717
You see the difference?

30:03.887 --> 30:05.055
And besides,

30:06.765 --> 30:08.559
I have an equal in Stella.

30:10.978 --> 30:13.355
Now, it was around here.

30:14.648 --> 30:17.401
It looks like there was a landslide
during the earthquake.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.653
Oh, yes. The whole area
was very badly hit.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.084
I'll come back with some tools.

30:34.168 --> 30:35.794
What are you hoping to find?

30:37.212 --> 30:38.714
A tangible link to our past.

30:40.174 --> 30:42.426
To the creatures that came before us.

30:44.595 --> 30:46.180
To what you think is out there.

30:48.724 --> 30:49.933
Maybe.

30:54.021 --> 30:59.026
But how can a dead fossil
prove the existence of a living one?

31:00.903 --> 31:04.907
It can't.
But it might give us hints. Clues.

31:06.783 --> 31:07.951
You really believe that?

31:09.453 --> 31:10.787
I think I believe.

31:12.915 --> 31:15.792
I'm never sure of the difference
between thinking and believing.

31:16.752 --> 31:18.837
Perhaps one day you can teach me.

31:21.131 --> 31:24.092
I thought you favored
hard evidence over supposition.

31:25.135 --> 31:27.930
Science requires dreams
just like your theology.

31:28.722 --> 31:32.976
To make a leap in the dark,
from ignorance to understanding.

31:36.563 --> 31:37.814
Faith.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.204
Do you believe in the serpent?

31:56.208 --> 31:57.751
I don't know, Frankie.

31:59.253 --> 32:01.296
I'm not sure we have all the answers yet.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.341
But don't tell my husband.

32:04.424 --> 32:05.968
I can keep secrets.

32:07.386 --> 32:08.554
So can I.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.226
They've been harvesting oysters.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.062
I used to do it myself as a child.

32:17.145 --> 32:19.606
Oh. I thought you were a city girl.

32:19.690 --> 32:21.775
No, I lived on the coast until I was 16.

32:23.694 --> 32:26.697
My father brought me to London
to meet my husband.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.702
I'm sorry. You must miss him.

32:36.957 --> 32:40.002
The first thing you'd see
if you came to my house is a--

32:41.545 --> 32:43.589
a Japanese kintsugi vase.

32:44.464 --> 32:48.760
It's pottery that's been broken
and put back together with gold.

32:48.844 --> 32:49.845
It's beautiful.

32:52.222 --> 32:54.266
Michael gave it to me when we met.

32:59.521 --> 33:03.942
He told me he wanted to break me
and mend me with gold.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.783
Did he hurt you?

33:26.173 --> 33:27.508
Look.

34:21.186 --> 34:22.938
Bit different to Knightsbridge, eh?

34:46.210 --> 34:49.505
-Hello. Thank you for coming.
-Not at all.

34:49.590 --> 34:50.757
It's good to see you.

34:54.594 --> 34:56.304
-How's the patient?
-Better.

34:57.181 --> 34:59.725
I'm cleaning the wound every day,
as you said.

35:10.861 --> 35:11.862
Any pain?

35:12.863 --> 35:14.323
Only when I breathe.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.074
Very good.

35:20.287 --> 35:21.455
Thank you.

35:38.305 --> 35:41.350
Laudanum. I won't charge.

35:42.309 --> 35:43.602
Thank you.

35:44.269 --> 35:46.605
If you promise not to go back to work.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.650
I've already lost my job.

35:51.485 --> 35:52.694
How are you managing?

35:54.404 --> 35:55.989
We're getting by.

35:59.326 --> 36:01.453
I'm going to pay your rent
while you convalesce.

36:02.996 --> 36:05.249
You've made a first-class contribution
to medicine.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.794
-It's the least we can do.
-You saved my brother's life.

36:08.877 --> 36:10.462
I insist.

36:21.431 --> 36:22.558
We don't want charity.

36:23.141 --> 36:25.477
Nev and I are educated people
used to solving our own problems.

36:25.561 --> 36:30.065
-I know. Think of it as a loan until you--
-Until what?

36:30.148 --> 36:33.110
We're trapped here in this slum,
making matchboxes and gunpowder.

36:33.193 --> 36:35.654
-Can't you see that?
-I can.

36:35.737 --> 36:38.365
-That's why I became a socialist.
-Troublemakers.

36:50.377 --> 36:53.046
Sometimes you have to make trouble
to get change.

36:53.922 --> 36:57.301
There we go. All well.
The laudanum should help with the pain.

36:58.427 --> 36:59.845
Once again, thank you, Doctor.

37:02.097 --> 37:04.850
Come along to a meeting.
You'd be very welcome.

37:09.188 --> 37:10.689
All the best.

37:17.196 --> 37:20.574
I need your help, Spencer.
Help me to change things.

37:21.783 --> 37:22.993
What could I do?

37:23.076 --> 37:25.913
You could talk to Charles Ambrose.
He never takes me seriously.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.207
And say what exactly?

37:28.957 --> 37:30.459
People need clean, affordable homes.

37:30.542 --> 37:34.588
We need to persuade Ambrose to bring
a social housing bill before Parliament.

37:36.423 --> 37:39.968
I suppose I could write to him.
Tell him what I've seen.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.095
Let me do the drafts so
you can include all the right facts.

37:42.179 --> 37:44.973
Or we could meet for lunch.
Compose it together.

37:51.772 --> 37:56.068
Dear Mr. Ambrose,
I hope you'll forgive my writing to you.

37:57.402 --> 37:58.904
I've recently had the opportunity

37:58.987 --> 38:01.740
to learn about the housing conditions
in your constituency,

38:02.950 --> 38:09.248
and I think now, as we approach the
twentieth century, it is time for change.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.702
Colchester station!

39:28.785 --> 39:30.162
Martha.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.082
What are you doing here?

39:34.166 --> 39:37.920
Well, nice to see you too.
I was in town, in the library.

39:38.003 --> 39:39.463
-Where's Frankie?
-With Stella.

39:39.546 --> 39:42.591
Here. Let me take this.
I've got so much to tell you.

39:42.674 --> 39:45.552
-Oh, me too.
-And I can't wait to show you the cottage.

39:48.347 --> 39:49.765
It's there.

39:51.642 --> 39:52.643
It's lovely.

39:57.481 --> 39:59.024
It's Will.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.196
Whoa there.

40:08.116 --> 40:09.368
Hello, Cora.

40:11.453 --> 40:15.290
I've just been in the library.
It wasn't a mirage. It's called a--

40:15.374 --> 40:17.000
-A fata morgana.
-How do you know?

40:17.084 --> 40:18.418
It's in one of my books.

40:18.961 --> 40:21.630
Angelucci saw one
in Italy in the Messina Strait.

40:21.713 --> 40:22.840
Look.

40:22.923 --> 40:26.468
So, when the right type of cold and warm
air mix they create a refracting lens.

40:26.552 --> 40:28.428
So things in the water
appear moved and distorted.

40:28.512 --> 40:31.223
-I'll show myself around then.
-I'll just be a minute.

40:34.268 --> 40:36.019
The wonders of science.

40:36.103 --> 40:39.690
And yet… it bothers me.

40:39.773 --> 40:40.774
Why?

40:42.067 --> 40:43.235
I don't know.

40:44.236 --> 40:47.698
You and I,
we think we see a boat sailing in the sky.

40:48.574 --> 40:53.078
And Naomi thinks she sees a serpent
in the water.

40:54.496 --> 40:55.998
I d-- I don't know.

40:57.332 --> 40:58.584
What does Stella think about it?

41:02.171 --> 41:03.380
I haven't told her.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.432
I should go in. Make up with Martha.

41:17.352 --> 41:18.770
Cora.

41:21.356 --> 41:23.525
Do you think there's something strange
going on here?

41:25.152 --> 41:26.278
Of course not.

41:46.882 --> 41:48.967
-Matthew.
-The barricades are finished!

41:49.718 --> 41:52.429
-I'm going to start a night watch.
-What? Matthew.

41:52.513 --> 41:55.974
Fires on the beach.
I'll do tonight, then set up a rota.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.851
And if I see it--

41:57.935 --> 42:01.939
What? You'll tackle it
with an oak branch?

42:02.022 --> 42:03.106
Wrestle it to the ground?

42:03.190 --> 42:04.983
I'll run back to the village
and raise the alarm.

42:06.485 --> 42:10.781
Don't you understand? The children,
all of us, we need reassurance.

42:12.866 --> 42:13.951
Right.

42:15.953 --> 42:19.248
-Perhaps they just need some clarity.
-What do you mean?

42:19.331 --> 42:21.959
My friend, Mrs. Seaborne,
she's a naturalist,

42:22.042 --> 42:25.671
and she's offered to come
to the school and talk to the children.

42:25.754 --> 42:26.964
I see.

42:27.548 --> 42:28.715
I trust you'll welcome her.

42:33.011 --> 42:34.638
What would you like me to do?

42:34.721 --> 42:36.098
Convene the parish council.

42:36.181 --> 42:39.476
Absolutely not. A meeting
will only entrench people's fears.

42:39.560 --> 42:43.188
Then do it your way. And let the devil in.

42:58.871 --> 43:00.455
Frankie. Ten minutes.

43:00.539 --> 43:01.957
Yes.

43:42.623 --> 43:45.417
"I sought the Lord,
and he answered me

43:45.501 --> 43:47.961
and delivered me from all my fears."

44:01.683 --> 44:03.310
What are you afraid of?

44:12.110 --> 44:13.153
Nothing.

44:15.072 --> 44:16.198
Nothing.

44:19.117 --> 44:21.495
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

45:45.913 --> 45:46.997
Cora's brought her fossils.

45:51.460 --> 45:52.586
What's happened?

45:54.171 --> 45:56.215
A seagull flew into the house last night.

45:56.924 --> 45:58.383
I promise you, it's a sign.

45:58.467 --> 46:01.386
-It's all right. Don't worry.
-The serpent is coming for me.

46:01.470 --> 46:03.096
Cora's going to explain everything.

46:06.892 --> 46:11.313
Buried in the mud, all around us,
are the remnants of ancient creatures.

46:11.396 --> 46:14.858
Creatures that God put on this earth
thousands of years ago.

46:14.942 --> 46:18.320
Well, creatures,
I believe, evolved over time.

46:18.403 --> 46:20.989
Does that mean
in thousands of years, people will find

46:21.073 --> 46:23.784
-the remnants of the serpent?
-Stupid question. Be quiet.

46:23.867 --> 46:25.369
No, it's a good question.

46:25.452 --> 46:27.329
You mean it might be real?

46:29.790 --> 46:32.626
Yes.
If it's a living fossil.

46:32.709 --> 46:36.421
A living fossil?
Then why have I never heard of them?

46:36.505 --> 46:37.714
Well, I don't know.

46:37.798 --> 46:41.093
It's a well-known theory that
some animals could have escaped evolution.

46:41.176 --> 46:42.511
So there is a serpent?

46:43.554 --> 46:45.305
Settle down, children.

46:45.389 --> 46:47.933
-Mrs. Seaborne is not saying that.
-No, no. I'm simply say--

46:48.016 --> 46:49.726
Is there a serpent or not?

46:52.729 --> 46:54.022
Just tell me the truth.

46:57.860 --> 46:59.736
Well, that's what I'm here
to find out.

47:01.280 --> 47:05.325
The truth is
I-- I honestly don't know.

47:06.910 --> 47:08.036
The serpent's coming for us.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.998
-The serpent's coming for us.
-No, that's not what I mean.

47:11.081 --> 47:13.584
-The serpent's coming-- Serpent!
-That's not what I mean.

47:13.667 --> 47:16.295
-Jacob, Mark, stop that!
-Serpent!

47:16.378 --> 47:20.007
-Wait. You're scared?
-Calm down. Stop. You've had your fun.

47:21.592 --> 47:23.468
Children, enough.

47:28.807 --> 47:30.434
Stop it. Just shut up.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.187
-Naomi.
-Naomi, pull yourself toge--

47:45.574 --> 47:46.783
She did it.

47:47.868 --> 47:51.747
She did it. She did it.

47:52.247 --> 47:54.583
-She did it.
-Ruth, sit down!

47:54.666 --> 47:57.669
She did it. She did it. She did it.

47:57.753 --> 48:00.672
She did it. She did it. She did it.

48:00.756 --> 48:03.967
She did it. She did it.

48:04.051 --> 48:06.595
Elizabeth. What are you doing?
Sit down!

48:06.678 --> 48:09.848
-She did it.
-Mark. What are you doing?

48:12.809 --> 48:15.729
-She's hurting me!
-She's hurting me.

48:20.984 --> 48:22.361
Sit down!

48:25.322 --> 48:26.615
Jo. Don't. Please, please.

48:27.324 --> 48:30.202
Please. Don't join in. Please.

48:33.622 --> 48:35.958
John, go after your sister.

48:37.376 --> 48:39.169
Naomi? Naomi.

48:40.212 --> 48:41.463
Naomi.

48:47.678 --> 48:49.388
Naomi, please!

49:04.111 --> 49:05.237
Frankie?

49:11.243 --> 49:12.619
Jo?
