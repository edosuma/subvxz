00:01.390 --> 00:03.623
You best take that off
before your father gets home.

00:03.884 --> 00:05.136
Why you dressed like that?

00:05.296 --> 00:07.408
- We wear that in Bresil.
- We're not in Brazil.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.494
That's your ex-girlfriend.

00:11.767 --> 00:14.425
You're kicked off the team.
I'm sorry about that.

00:14.687 --> 00:17.748
You wanted to play football?
Who doesn't want to be a panther?

00:19.196 --> 00:22.141
You wanna come by tomorrow?
Come out and practice with us?

00:22.424 --> 00:25.287
The coroner found upholstery fibers

00:25.447 --> 00:28.522
from gmc wagons... just like this one.

00:28.883 --> 00:30.425
I didn't mean to do it, dad.

00:31.916 --> 00:33.315
Dear god, forgive us for this.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.741
<i>The recruiting circus
has come to town, folks.</i>

00:42.901 --> 00:45.201
<i>Today's the first day
that college recruiters</i>

00:45.500 --> 00:48.776
<i>are officially allowed to talk
to the individual football players.</i>

00:48.936 --> 00:52.366
<i>The question on everyone's mind
is who will our very own</i>

00:52.565 --> 00:54.065
<i>Smash Williams talk to first?</i>

00:57.848 --> 00:59.033
No, you cannot.

00:59.906 --> 01:00.888
He's sleeping.

01:01.554 --> 01:02.845
No, I will not!

01:03.554 --> 01:04.554
Eh--good-bye.

01:05.409 --> 01:06.665
Lord have mercy!

01:13.304 --> 01:14.652
Georgia tech is on the phone.

01:15.052 --> 01:17.524
- Take a message.
- I'm not your personal assistant.

01:17.791 --> 01:19.649
Well that's good,
'cause you not getting paid.

01:19.809 --> 01:21.634
Take this phone.
Mama gettin' irritated.

01:21.794 --> 01:23.995
Smash train is pulling out the station.

01:24.155 --> 01:26.396
You better hang on
before you lose your seat.

01:30.321 --> 01:32.387
Jules, honey, I made pancakes.

01:32.610 --> 01:34.002
Wanna come out for breakfast?

01:34.218 --> 01:35.232
I'm not hungry.

01:35.936 --> 01:38.133
We're gonna leave
in about 20 minutes, okay?

01:38.526 --> 01:40.010
She still upset over Matt?

01:40.317 --> 01:41.317
I think so.

01:46.217 --> 01:47.017
Hi.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.394
Don't look.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.605
Where are your manners?

01:51.891 --> 01:52.785
Sorry.

01:53.909 --> 01:57.052
- I'll give you one, if you give me one.
- I'm not giving anything up.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.300
What?

02:00.850 --> 02:03.909
So you want me to make some dinner?
I can make some beef stroganoff.

02:04.170 --> 02:05.114
If you want to.

02:05.274 --> 02:08.080
You've done enough around here.
The place looks great.

02:08.463 --> 02:11.087
I'm blown away.
I don't think it's ever been this clean.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.179
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:17.974 --> 02:18.799
You okay?

02:19.529 --> 02:20.529
I'm fine.

02:21.988 --> 02:23.642
You just gonna stand there?

02:24.034 --> 02:24.789
No...

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:35.023 --> 02:36.573
What, are you packing?

02:36.942 --> 02:39.903
- You don't have to leave. I'll leave.
- No, it's fine.

02:40.165 --> 02:42.426
Don't be an idiot, okay?
Come on, look, this is stupid.

02:42.586 --> 02:44.378
Where the hell you gonna go? Tim.

02:44.699 --> 02:47.522
- You guys have your fun.
- Tim, I'm talking to you right now.

02:47.682 --> 02:50.035
Listen, are you thinking about this?
What are you doing?

02:50.270 --> 02:52.890
I can leave. You don't--
This is your house.

02:53.181 --> 02:54.168
I know it is.

03:16.346 --> 03:17.441
How's it going?

03:17.703 --> 03:19.456
What's all this you got going on here?

03:19.639 --> 03:20.903
It's my clothes.

03:21.165 --> 03:23.127
That's nice.
Why are they right here?

03:23.738 --> 03:25.249
Kinda need a place to stay.

03:28.604 --> 03:29.565
Please.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.405
48 hours, Tim.
That's all you got. 48.

03:33.761 --> 03:35.083
I'll take it.
Thank you.

03:35.431 --> 03:38.182
And don't even dream
about coming anywhere near my room.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.324
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- Shut up.

04:28.294 --> 04:29.954
Mrs. Taylor, excuse me.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.927
I was told to see you
about getting a set of keys

04:33.087 --> 04:36.306
for the activity lounge for
a staff meeting of the Dillon chronicle.

04:36.537 --> 04:40.039
Sweetheart, you need to talk
to your faculty advisor about that.

04:40.199 --> 04:41.748
That would be me, ma'am.

04:42.121 --> 04:44.174
- Did you just call me "ma'am?"
- I did.

04:44.381 --> 04:45.654
Sorry-- Noah Barnett.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.948
English lit, creative writing, speech,

04:48.210 --> 04:49.783
and faculty advisor for the paper.

04:50.099 --> 04:52.024
You're the--
oh, good lord.

04:52.671 --> 04:54.121
How old are you, 12?

04:54.350 --> 04:55.487
Don't answer that.

04:55.759 --> 04:59.075
A lot's happened since I've been gone.
I was gone having a baby.

04:59.305 --> 05:01.971
No, I don't even need to hit the ball
off the tee anymore.

05:02.131 --> 05:04.197
I've graduated.
My dad pitches to me now.

05:05.604 --> 05:08.477
In tee ball, when you're little
you hit the ball off a tee.

05:08.637 --> 05:11.013
We're a football family, so.
You know what?

05:11.275 --> 05:13.531
- Those keys will be in my office.
- I'll come by later.

05:13.691 --> 05:15.453
- My office'll be great.
- Thank you.

05:15.613 --> 05:16.993
- Nce to meet you.
- You too.

05:17.632 --> 05:18.580
Listen up.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.206
Stop what you're doing.
I want to talk to you a second.

05:21.366 --> 05:24.372
A number of you today are gonna get
an opportunity to meet some recruiters.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.291
These recruiters wanna try
to get you to commit to this, that,

05:28.572 --> 05:31.815
or any other school any way they can.
They don't care how.

05:31.975 --> 05:34.981
But the texas high school
athletic administration, they do care.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.760
I'm talking about
losing state eligibility

05:38.177 --> 05:40.584
if someone gets caught
accepting anything.

05:40.846 --> 05:44.527
Cell phones, concert tickets,
meals, rides home.

05:45.451 --> 05:46.493
With that said,

05:46.653 --> 05:49.172
any of y'all want to meet
with any particular recruiters,

05:49.332 --> 05:52.318
you talk to me or the other coaches.
We work it through my office.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.060
Anything you need, you will get.

05:55.611 --> 05:58.101
Let's go have a good practice,
get outta here early today.

06:02.159 --> 06:04.360
How you doing?
Good to meet you.

06:04.529 --> 06:06.116
Smash Williams, how you doing, man?

06:06.393 --> 06:07.945
Pete Kinderton, Miami South.

06:08.207 --> 06:09.905
Look, I don't know about florida, man.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.446
Y'all get hurricanes--

06:11.606 --> 06:12.552
How are you?

06:12.712 --> 06:14.826
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

06:15.088 --> 06:16.708
How's owen's turf toe doing?

06:16.868 --> 06:18.900
He's good.
He said he's gonna play through it.

06:19.060 --> 06:20.223
Man, that guy is tough.

06:20.383 --> 06:22.286
- You know Owen Davenport?
- Yeah.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.579
- He graduated my sophomore year.
- That's right.

06:24.739 --> 06:26.901
He's been starting for us
for the last couple years.

06:27.061 --> 06:28.639
Guy's fantastic, yeah.

06:31.253 --> 06:33.178
I'm sorry, do you guys know each other?

06:33.440 --> 06:34.596
I've seen you around.

06:36.215 --> 06:37.773
Listen, I gotta get out of here.

06:37.989 --> 06:39.557
But I'll be here a couple days.

06:40.155 --> 06:41.971
- Gimme a shout. Take care.
- Yes, sir.

06:42.131 --> 06:44.022
- Good seeing you again, Noelle.
- Bye.

06:44.293 --> 06:47.005
Hey, I didn't know Owen Davenport
had a little sister.

06:47.593 --> 06:48.623
He does.

06:49.233 --> 06:51.071
Well...we should hang out some time.

06:51.383 --> 06:52.548
Yeah, definitely.

06:52.918 --> 06:54.698
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

06:55.003 --> 06:55.990
Okay, see ya.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.085
You really gonna do this thing?

07:15.245 --> 07:17.085
I don't know.
What do you think?

07:18.246 --> 07:19.246
Santiago!

07:19.541 --> 07:20.541
Come here.

07:20.904 --> 07:22.696
Listen up--here's what I want you to do.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.731
I want you to go to
the guidance counselor, Mrs. Taylor,

07:25.993 --> 07:29.252
and I want you to tell her I sent you.
And I want her to check your credits,

07:29.732 --> 07:31.876
and to see
that you're squared away academically.

07:32.036 --> 07:33.951
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

07:34.111 --> 07:35.897
And be nice to her; she's my wife.

07:36.068 --> 07:37.587
- Yes, coach.
- Go do that.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.916
Then we just stood there
and watched as--

07:43.076 --> 07:45.877
as the car turned into, like,
a giant charcoal briquette.

07:46.909 --> 07:48.128
Then what happened?

07:48.559 --> 07:50.743
And then we just--
we went home.

07:51.226 --> 07:53.258
But that's--
that's good, right?

07:53.545 --> 07:55.056
My dad destroyed evidence.

07:55.436 --> 07:56.845
He's a cop.
He can't do that.

07:57.107 --> 07:59.242
Now I've got him into this thing and...

07:59.651 --> 08:01.850
Landry, I don't know
what you want me to say.

08:02.112 --> 08:03.478
I just wanted to tell you,

08:03.638 --> 08:06.408
because I don't have anyone else
I can talk to about this.

08:06.633 --> 08:07.564
Yeah, I know.

08:07.826 --> 08:09.313
You been doing okay though?

08:09.473 --> 08:10.414
Yeah, I mean...

08:12.118 --> 08:13.955
about as good as I can be, I guess.

08:15.530 --> 08:17.925
Hi, y'all. Can I talk to you?
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

08:18.085 --> 08:21.148
Can I talk to you for a quick second?
Sorry, I'm rushing around this morning.

08:21.308 --> 08:23.321
- Sorry to interrupt you.
- That's all right.

08:23.594 --> 08:24.983
Good to see you, Landry.

08:25.143 --> 08:28.198
Honey, I need to ask you a favor.
I need a go-getter. And you are--

08:28.405 --> 08:30.199
Hey, Lyla!
Come here, come here.

08:30.406 --> 08:31.274
Perfect!

08:31.434 --> 08:34.025
I need two go-getters.
Here's the situation.

08:34.205 --> 08:36.662
They're all on me about
this whole pantherama thing.

08:36.841 --> 08:40.465
Last year, I scheduled both the
entertainment and the silent auction.

08:40.773 --> 08:43.777
This year, that is a burden
that I cannot bear.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.890
So what I thought would be great

08:46.124 --> 08:48.077
is to actually pass
on the entertainment part

08:48.237 --> 08:49.974
of pantherama to a couple of students.

08:50.134 --> 08:51.233
What do you think?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.612
Yeah, you know, I--actually,
I've been studying really hard.

08:55.874 --> 08:57.292
I would love to, but--

08:57.452 --> 08:59.977
I've the christ teen messengers thing.

09:00.137 --> 09:03.553
Oh, honey, you are not using
Jesus Christ our Lord as an excuse

09:03.713 --> 09:05.554
not to help out your counselor, are you?

09:05.714 --> 09:07.852
- No, ma'am.
- That's nice, thank you.

09:08.012 --> 09:10.635
And Tyra, you too busy studying
to help me out?

09:11.901 --> 09:15.609
Yeah? Oh, really?
Great. Oh, I appreciate it.

09:15.817 --> 09:19.311
Y'all are gonna do a super job.
I'm not kidding. I mean, I'm excited.

09:19.731 --> 09:21.763
All right, girls.
Thank you so much appreciate it!

09:22.025 --> 09:23.098
Have a great day!

09:24.541 --> 09:28.194
Okay, okay, so Tracy will do
the movie review, 250 words.

09:28.598 --> 09:31.321
But what we really need
are feature stories.

09:32.012 --> 09:34.401
Okay, so what do you got?
Anybody got any ideas?

09:34.663 --> 09:36.271
People, this is your paper, not mine.

09:36.431 --> 09:38.321
What stories do you think need telling?

09:38.787 --> 09:41.988
Well, the knife has never played
anywhere in the state of texas.

09:42.946 --> 09:45.697
Good, that's-- that's interesting...
if it's true.

09:45.881 --> 09:48.087
Although I don't think
it merits 1,000 words.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.314
Anyone else?

09:50.095 --> 09:51.085
Julie.

09:51.245 --> 09:52.502
What about pantherama?

09:52.764 --> 09:55.046
Of course,
you're pitching a football idea.

09:55.641 --> 09:57.857
I'm not pitching a football idea, okay?

09:58.421 --> 10:01.879
Pantherama's an event that's held
every year by Dillon high, right?

10:02.039 --> 10:04.836
And it generates a lot of money.
But where does the money go?

10:04.996 --> 10:06.714
Who decided how to distribute the money?

10:06.874 --> 10:09.144
Do all the sports get
the same level of funding?

10:09.543 --> 10:10.854
I don't think so.

10:11.116 --> 10:13.356
That's exactly the kind of thinking
I'm looking for.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.861
Excellent, excellent.

10:15.021 --> 10:17.316
You just talked yourself
into a feature assignment.

10:17.476 --> 10:18.417
Well done.

10:20.732 --> 10:22.741
Your grades look pretty good,
actually...

10:23.451 --> 10:25.282
considering you transferred...

10:25.739 --> 10:26.822
five times?

10:27.338 --> 10:29.817
My uncle's work makes him move
around a lot.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.200
What about your parents?

10:31.806 --> 10:33.251
They were deported.

10:34.058 --> 10:35.058
I'm sorry.

10:35.758 --> 10:37.208
But I was born here.

10:37.851 --> 10:40.398
So did they leave you, then,
in the care of your uncle?

10:40.558 --> 10:42.352
Is he your legal guardian?

10:44.733 --> 10:46.347
Well, I'm not quite clear then,

10:46.507 --> 10:49.184
why you put Garrity Motors
as your address here.

10:50.019 --> 10:52.312
I just thought it would be easier,
you know?

10:52.658 --> 10:53.855
Easier for what?

10:54.117 --> 10:55.844
You never know when my uncle's work

10:56.004 --> 10:57.995
is gonna have to make him
move again, so.

10:58.699 --> 11:01.091
I am gonna need
to have your real address.

11:01.251 --> 11:03.147
And I need to have a meeting
with your uncle,

11:03.307 --> 11:05.643
just so we can sort of sit down
and talk about what we--

11:05.803 --> 11:07.531
what would happen in the coming year.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.254
Yeah, no--he--
he pulls double shifts all the time.

11:10.442 --> 11:14.063
It's really hard to pull him away...
but I could have him sign whatever.

11:14.223 --> 11:16.295
If you give me something,
I could have him sign it.

11:16.455 --> 11:19.297
Well you know what?
It's gotta be face to face.

11:19.559 --> 11:21.775
Go to your house after school one day,

11:21.935 --> 11:24.511
- wherever's convenient for him.
- It's not gonna work.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.346
How come, santiago?

11:27.810 --> 11:29.754
It's just--
it's just not gonna work.

11:31.068 --> 11:32.103
Hey, listen...

11:34.361 --> 11:36.490
is there something
you'd like to tell me?

11:43.822 --> 11:45.872
My uncle hasn't been home in a while.

11:46.419 --> 11:47.742
How long is a while?

11:50.287 --> 11:51.409
10 or 11 months.

11:55.314 --> 11:58.300
It's no big deal. It's just this car.
This guy is selling a car.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.573
And I was thinking about
maybe going and look at it.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.773
But it's probably
too much money anyway, so.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.092
Well, matthew saracen.

12:04.385 --> 12:06.052
This is your lucky day,

12:06.460 --> 12:09.306
because I happen to be
an exceptional negotiator.

12:09.568 --> 12:10.657
Oh, is that right?

12:11.014 --> 12:13.560
Did you used to work with Buddy Garrity,
or something like that?

12:13.956 --> 12:16.125
No, I actually know cars.

12:17.117 --> 12:19.032
I bet I could even get you a discount.

12:19.192 --> 12:20.151
Oh, yeah?

12:36.512 --> 12:38.712
I just--I need to keep the door closed.

12:39.587 --> 12:40.587
Why's that?

12:41.018 --> 12:44.068
Because my ex-boyfriend
and his new girlfriend are out there.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.272
And they're--
they're pretty into pda.

12:48.315 --> 12:49.888
So I just-- I thought it would be

12:50.150 --> 12:51.721
less awkward, if I just avoided them,

12:51.881 --> 12:53.767
and I didn't have
to really deal with it.

12:54.297 --> 12:57.394
And I'm sure they'll be gone in a sec,
so I'll be out of your hair.

12:58.925 --> 13:00.357
That's classic, isn't it?

13:01.172 --> 13:04.027
He's the QBb1, right,
and she's the cheerleader.

13:04.862 --> 13:05.942
She's, like...

13:06.712 --> 13:08.083
this perfect doll.

13:09.776 --> 13:11.978
And I'm just, like, some interlude.

13:12.929 --> 13:14.485
And she's the real deal.

13:16.885 --> 13:18.026
I guess I just...

13:19.697 --> 13:21.528
I guess I just came in to cry.

13:24.176 --> 13:25.204
You hungry?

13:27.809 --> 13:29.485
I always eat when I get dumped.

13:30.330 --> 13:31.448
That's classic.

13:32.257 --> 13:33.807
It is pretty classic.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.213
It's a veggie deluxe.

13:38.372 --> 13:40.072
I guess it couldn't hurt, right?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.527
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

13:50.377 --> 13:52.614
I can't believe you're even talking
about eligibility.

13:52.774 --> 13:55.995
What's important right now is the fact
that this is a boy who's an orphan.

13:56.257 --> 13:58.025
That's what you should be
thinking about.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.222
I got a great idea! You know what?

14:00.382 --> 14:03.612
He joins my team, he's on my field,
he's got a family.

14:03.865 --> 14:05.627
No, we get him a family,

14:05.787 --> 14:07.672
then we can talk about him
being on your team.

14:07.832 --> 14:09.163
Period. End of discussion.

14:09.323 --> 14:11.344
That's just the way
it's gonna have to work.

14:11.606 --> 14:15.394
So there's this girl dancin' to devil
went down to georgia--she's new.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.050
And I walk up to her, and I'm all,

14:17.210 --> 14:19.521
"bitch, that's my signature song.
Step off."

14:19.948 --> 14:22.977
I'll kick her ass. I dance in boots,
and chaps, and a thong.

14:23.137 --> 14:26.551
- What the hell is she thinkin'?
- I don't know, good costume though.

14:26.711 --> 14:28.545
- I'll tell you that much.
- All I'm sayin'.

14:28.806 --> 14:30.029
- Beer?
- Yeah.

14:30.824 --> 14:32.608
- Hi, y'all.
- Hi, baby.

14:33.679 --> 14:35.660
Tim, could I talk to you for a second?

14:37.813 --> 14:40.292
Don't you dare screw my sister.

14:40.592 --> 14:42.752
- What are you talking about?
- I swear to god, Tim.

14:43.045 --> 14:45.326
I know that you like to create havoc
wherever you go.

14:45.486 --> 14:48.669
I'm serious as cancer.
Do not... screw mindy.

14:48.992 --> 14:50.678
That's my line. Don't cross it.

14:51.504 --> 14:52.760
How's landry doing?

14:53.937 --> 14:55.965
You're on hour 36 of the 48, okay?

14:56.899 --> 14:57.899
Tick tock.

14:59.835 --> 15:01.186
Find a place, Tim.

15:01.732 --> 15:03.062
Let me ask you, Brian.

15:03.548 --> 15:05.751
Have you given
any consideration to attending

15:05.911 --> 15:07.572
a historically black college?

15:08.072 --> 15:11.070
I'm mostly about my game,
know what I'm saying?

15:11.332 --> 15:13.490
Can I get you some more coffee,
Mr. Gordon?

15:13.650 --> 15:15.456
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

15:16.079 --> 15:18.001
Let me cut straight to the chase, Brian.

15:18.423 --> 15:20.789
Whitmore university doesn't offer
athletic scholarships,

15:21.051 --> 15:22.883
but we do offer academic ones.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.339
Should you decide to enroll at Whitmore,

15:25.499 --> 15:27.542
we'd love to have you
play football for us.

15:27.702 --> 15:30.204
But regardless,
you'll get a full year of education

15:30.364 --> 15:32.897
from one of the top schools
in the country, guaranteed.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.460
So I could be on a team
that was two and nine last season.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.860
- Say, brian.
- Okay, look. Tell me this.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.875
How many players were drafted last year?

15:40.035 --> 15:42.638
- I think you know the answer to that.
- Yeah, none.

15:43.065 --> 15:45.016
Look, I know you'll get other offers.

15:45.392 --> 15:46.874
Yeah, you right about that.

15:47.034 --> 15:49.816
I do understand the allure
of a big football university.

15:49.976 --> 15:52.726
I just hope you'll give our college
real consideration.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.987
The next four years
can change your life.

15:55.147 --> 15:57.003
Mr. Gordon, college isn't the goal.

15:57.339 --> 15:58.679
It's the means to an end.

15:58.839 --> 16:00.746
I plan on going pro sooner, not later.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.373
I don't want to waste your time or mine.

16:08.524 --> 16:11.297
- You call about the dart here?
- Yeah, I did.

16:13.353 --> 16:14.342
275 horsepower?

16:14.626 --> 16:15.426
Yeah.

16:16.914 --> 16:18.304
It's not a slant six, is it?

16:18.675 --> 16:19.556
Ah, no.

16:19.820 --> 16:22.312
Smart girl, pretty girl, knows her cars.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.346
So what do you think?
What are you feeling?

16:25.506 --> 16:28.192
What do you think?
You're the car--

16:28.586 --> 16:31.181
- Yeah, I think it's great.
- This? You think?

16:31.472 --> 16:32.846
Absolutely, I love it.

16:33.998 --> 16:36.573
You can get a really good deal
on this, trust me.

16:37.162 --> 16:37.962
Okay.

16:38.461 --> 16:41.828
So you realize you're selling to QB1
of the Dillon Panthers, right?

16:42.324 --> 16:43.913
I'll take $200 off the price.

16:47.095 --> 16:50.753
Everything that you donated will be
on a silent auction table at pantherama.

16:52.223 --> 16:54.373
Great. Thank you so much.

16:54.644 --> 16:55.758
Okay, bye-bye.

16:56.005 --> 16:57.844
- Hey, listen--
- Hello, gentlemen.

16:58.691 --> 17:00.253
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

17:00.413 --> 17:02.223
To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?

17:02.485 --> 17:05.059
We have been talking
about this santiago situation.

17:06.077 --> 17:08.426
Look, santiago has been
working for me part-time.

17:08.587 --> 17:11.170
Did you know that?
He's a great worker.

17:11.435 --> 17:14.355
And when Eric told me
about his living situation,

17:14.515 --> 17:15.569
I was appalled.

17:16.523 --> 17:20.242
And so, I came up with this moment
of scintillating clarity.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.679
He should move in with me.

17:24.425 --> 17:25.834
Easy. Simple.

17:26.885 --> 17:28.464
Can I talk to my husband for one sec?

17:28.625 --> 17:30.409
- Absolutely.
- Just one quick sec.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.583
I'll see you-- Thank you.

17:34.663 --> 17:37.536
- Why would you go and--
- Don't whisper yell at me please.

17:37.696 --> 17:40.072
Talk to him and bring him
into my office?

17:40.233 --> 17:42.165
And you're suggesting that Santiago,

17:42.325 --> 17:44.339
that poor child is gonna
go live with Buddy Gar--

17:44.499 --> 17:47.126
- We're not selling puppies here.
- I know we're not.

17:47.286 --> 17:50.110
This has got to go through
social services. That's the protocol.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.556
It's not an ideal situation.
But that's the situation.

17:53.716 --> 17:56.861
The protocol doesn't work, does it?
He didn't get the assistance he needed.

17:57.108 --> 17:59.066
He fell through the cracks.
And the protocol?

17:59.228 --> 18:01.886
This is not an alternative.
And I know what you're doing.

18:02.046 --> 18:05.203
This is convenient for you, so that
you can have your football season.

18:05.465 --> 18:08.382
Don't tell me I'm doing all this for
the kid just to get him on the team.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.054
What I'm saying is yeah,
he won't be living in a trailer alone.

18:11.214 --> 18:13.000
What I'm saying is yeah,
he'll have family.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.225
What I'm saying is yeah,
we can keep an eye on him.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.859
That's all I'm saying.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.058
This is ridiculous.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.897
How are we supposed
to figure out the entertainment

18:23.057 --> 18:24.615
if we don't have a single name?

18:26.920 --> 18:28.420
We're gonna get our names.

18:28.881 --> 18:29.881
Follow me.

18:34.007 --> 18:35.875
- That's the men's--
- I know.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.242
Hey, y'all!

18:41.829 --> 18:43.472
Listen up! Quiet down.

18:44.796 --> 18:46.285
Lyla, why are we here?

18:46.649 --> 18:48.946
Because nobody signed up for pantherama.

18:49.181 --> 18:51.040
Nobody signed up for the pantherama!

18:52.001 --> 18:53.259
I know, I know.

18:53.945 --> 18:56.968
Hey, am I right to think
that tradition dictates

18:57.128 --> 19:00.029
that the players provide
entertainment for pantherama?

19:00.235 --> 19:02.051
Is that right?
That's right.

19:02.313 --> 19:03.680
All right, listen up, ladies.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.430
Lyla and I, we have a job to do.

19:05.692 --> 19:07.870
Okay,
so just make this easy on everybody.

19:08.556 --> 19:10.546
You, freshman, pass this around.

19:10.747 --> 19:11.551
What?

19:14.840 --> 19:17.093
I'm gonna be spending
a lot of time with, um...

19:18.070 --> 19:20.111
- what's your name?
- Carter.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.266
Yeah, Lyla and I...

19:24.163 --> 19:27.279
we're gonna be spending
the whole week with Carter.

19:30.781 --> 19:31.936
Anybody else?

19:37.745 --> 19:38.745
Well done.

19:41.227 --> 19:42.290
This is good.

19:42.797 --> 19:44.447
And it's also too long.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.191
I didn't say we're not gonna run it,

19:47.351 --> 19:49.640
I just think you need to cut it down
by 500 words.

19:49.902 --> 19:52.889
- Well, that's half the article.
- Well, find the right half.

19:53.049 --> 19:55.847
Well, I thought you said
the story's supposed to show range.

19:57.285 --> 19:58.742
"On a blustery tuesday afternoon,

19:58.902 --> 20:01.888
"one can find half a dozen
multiloquous rally girls

20:02.048 --> 20:05.213
"selling raffle tickets,
and to what end? Pantherama."

20:06.775 --> 20:09.243
- Multiloquous?
- It just means talkative.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.484
Right.

20:11.031 --> 20:13.904
Don't use a $10 word
when a nickel one will do.

20:14.492 --> 20:18.294
And I think three angry paragraphs
about rally girls is kind of off point.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.957
- But I thought you said it was good.
- It is, it is.

20:22.656 --> 20:23.656
It's good.

20:24.107 --> 20:25.844
But good is the enemy of great.

20:26.230 --> 20:28.805
You know, the less a reporter says,
the more she hears.

20:29.714 --> 20:31.974
So, what,
did you work at a newspaper too?

20:32.522 --> 20:33.351
I did.

20:34.555 --> 20:37.104
- You're just trying to prove a point.
- I am.

20:37.616 --> 20:39.090
Columbia school of journalism

20:39.250 --> 20:42.578
and then a year at the city desk
of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

20:44.431 --> 20:45.696
It's a good article.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.490
Cut it down, make it great.

20:48.693 --> 20:49.496
Okay.

20:50.091 --> 20:53.079
So when Owen was being recruited,
it was crazy. I was a slave.

20:53.674 --> 20:55.790
Are you stuck taking messages
for Smash all the time?

20:56.515 --> 20:57.456
No.

20:58.477 --> 21:00.545
Owen played the recruiters
against each other.

21:00.870 --> 21:02.359
He would listen to what UCC said,

21:02.519 --> 21:05.591
and then go back to Miami Southern
and say "What are you gonna do for me?"

21:05.924 --> 21:07.665
And then he ended up with a Porsche.

21:08.481 --> 21:10.680
- For real?
- So, your brother likes Miami Southern.

21:11.541 --> 21:13.599
Oh, yeah.
He's, like, the king of that place.

21:15.738 --> 21:17.783
Are your parents happy
with his education?

21:18.074 --> 21:18.980
I guess, sure.

21:19.242 --> 21:21.461
My dad says the connection
he makes on the team

21:21.621 --> 21:23.973
will serve him better than a Masters.

21:24.693 --> 21:27.405
Your mother must be concerned
about him getting hurt.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.821
You know there are no guarantees
in football.

21:30.306 --> 21:33.536
Guys like Smash are blessed. That's
as close as you get to a guarantee.

21:34.556 --> 21:36.689
Amen. You got that right.

21:43.967 --> 21:47.530
He's here. Oh, my Lord, Matthew!

21:48.813 --> 21:50.542
- Is this it?
- This is it.

21:51.190 --> 21:52.913
- It's old.
- It's a classic.

21:53.076 --> 21:56.630
- That's what the owner told me.
- Let's just check out the engine.

21:56.904 --> 21:58.811
That is not bad for this age of a car.

21:59.130 --> 22:02.565
- No, these engines, they run forever.
- Yeah, clearly.

22:02.853 --> 22:06.903
I wanna go on a ride. Y'all move back.
Will you take us?

22:07.309 --> 22:09.640
- You want to go for a ride?
- I want to go for a ride!

22:09.959 --> 22:13.367
Grandma wants to go for a ride.
Let's all get in the car, go for a ride.

22:14.756 --> 22:17.246
- Oh it's nice.
- You know how to drive?

22:17.744 --> 22:18.873
I'm a good driver.

22:19.135 --> 22:20.531
I'll be the judge of that.

22:22.722 --> 22:24.016
- You good?
- I'm ready.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.208
Here we go.

22:29.914 --> 22:31.302
I know what you gonna say.

22:31.609 --> 22:34.322
Shoulda told you ahead of time
that I invited a friend for dinner.

22:34.804 --> 22:36.933
That wasn't even what I was gonna say.

22:38.292 --> 22:39.685
I was wondering if

22:39.947 --> 22:43.189
you had taken any thought to what
Mr Gordon said about Whitmore.

22:43.952 --> 22:47.526
Mom, were you listening
to anything Noelle was saying?

22:47.816 --> 22:50.276
Her brother worked it.
I ain't going to no tired school

22:50.499 --> 22:53.532
when I got recruiters from Florida,
Texas, and California on the line.

22:54.129 --> 22:56.160
What does that mean, "working it?"

22:56.835 --> 23:00.206
- I'm gonna look for the best situation.
- What has gotten into you, Brian?

23:01.036 --> 23:04.835
You were rude to Mr Gordon.
That man offered you a full scholarship.

23:05.354 --> 23:06.963
And then you waltz in here with this

23:07.225 --> 23:08.965
white girl and act like she a prophet.

23:09.227 --> 23:12.551
- Is that what this is about?
- No, you tell me what it's about!

23:12.931 --> 23:14.637
'Cause it's not even like that.

23:14.899 --> 23:16.006
I wanna know is--

23:16.989 --> 23:18.599
Is this what you think it's about?

23:18.861 --> 23:20.226
Is this why you play football?

23:20.494 --> 23:22.269
You have no idea how any of this works.

23:22.582 --> 23:25.119
Noelle's seen the whole thing before.
You haven't.

23:25.328 --> 23:28.444
You just want me to nod and smile and
say "yes, Mr Gordon" like a good boy.

23:28.630 --> 23:31.862
- He can't give me what I want.
- I want you

23:32.124 --> 23:34.330
to use your brain and think!

23:34.919 --> 23:37.201
And what if you end up
like Jason Street?

23:37.471 --> 23:40.454
Oh, he had the whole world.
He had everything until he got hurt.

23:40.716 --> 23:44.000
That's not ever gonna happen to me.
That's what I'm saying. I'm going

23:44.262 --> 23:46.335
all the way, all the way,
and all you can think about

23:46.597 --> 23:50.589
is how I might fail? How I might not
make it? No, no, I won't let you.

23:50.851 --> 23:52.925
Nobody's holding me back.
Not you, not anybody!

24:06.659 --> 24:09.275
What part of "get into a straight line"
don't y'all understand?

24:10.705 --> 24:12.153
Come on, guys, let's go! Come on!

24:12.415 --> 24:14.488
Let's go, let's go! Come on,

24:14.750 --> 24:17.241
- get up. Get up.
- You guys volunteered, right?

24:17.503 --> 24:19.368
Let's just get in a couple
straight lines.

24:19.630 --> 24:22.413
Let's try and figure this thing out.
It's gonna be really simple.

24:22.675 --> 24:23.831
It's just a walk.

24:24.093 --> 24:27.043
Just do what I do.
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:27.540 --> 24:28.733
D.H.S.--

24:31.061 --> 24:32.381
It's supposed to be funny.

24:33.146 --> 24:34.875
All right, all right, take a break.

24:35.146 --> 24:36.469
Five minute break.

24:36.731 --> 24:38.554
We're not done. Just take a break.

24:38.816 --> 24:41.582
Any bright ideas,
because I don't think that

24:41.787 --> 24:44.992
- the cheering thing is gonna work.
- No.

24:47.199 --> 24:48.272
Hey, hey you.

24:49.994 --> 24:51.275
Put your shirt back on.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.156
Oh, you got called out, man.

25:02.428 --> 25:03.428
All right.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.530
Take it off again.

25:14.924 --> 25:16.634
Now see that? That is entertainment.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.545
Put a little music to some moves.

25:21.901 --> 25:23.460
You can choreograph, right?

25:28.407 --> 25:30.689
If we're gonna do it,
let's make it fun, you know?

25:36.007 --> 25:38.736
That is what I'm talking about.
All right, guys.

25:39.001 --> 25:40.741
Okay, I get it, I get it. I get it.

25:41.105 --> 25:42.743
Let's get in a straight line.

25:43.253 --> 25:45.862
Okay, so that's pathetic.
I mean, how much vomit?

25:46.294 --> 25:48.749
Don't laugh when somebody
confesses something embarrassing.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.254
- Hey.
- Hey, y'all.

25:53.592 --> 25:55.089
Hey, mom. Hi.

25:56.811 --> 25:59.526
- Right on, keys.
- I brought Mr Barnett his keys.

26:00.022 --> 26:01.887
By the way,
that whole story's off the record.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.453
Incidentally, your daughter

26:04.740 --> 26:06.642
has a feature
in the Dillon Chronicle tomorrow.

26:06.904 --> 26:09.437
How about that? Good for you, sweetie.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.864
- Thank you.
- That's great.

26:12.113 --> 26:13.524
I'll see you later, mr. B.

26:13.786 --> 26:14.692
Adios.

26:18.324 --> 26:19.530
Everything okay in here?

26:19.792 --> 26:21.130
Yeah, everything's good.

26:21.627 --> 26:22.616
- Good.
- Thanks

26:22.878 --> 26:23.826
for the keys.

26:24.088 --> 26:26.745
- Appreciate it.
- Let me know if you need anything.

26:30.038 --> 26:31.041
Julie.

26:32.009 --> 26:33.009
Under over.

26:36.065 --> 26:37.065
Snapping.

26:42.314 --> 26:44.452
- Nice moves!
- No, it's not--

26:45.526 --> 26:47.558
Shut up. No, it's just

26:47.820 --> 26:50.535
this thing that I gotta do tomorrow
for Pantherama.

26:51.186 --> 26:52.188
What's that?

26:52.450 --> 26:55.420
It's that thing that you gotta take
my grandma to tomorrow night.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.943
Lyla and Tyra made up this stupid dance.

26:58.205 --> 27:00.488
And they think I need to be up
in the front row.

27:00.939 --> 27:03.115
And then, I think
we even gotta take our shirts off.

27:03.541 --> 27:04.881
Oh, like the Full Monty?

27:05.421 --> 27:07.036
No, not like the Full Monty, but it's

27:07.298 --> 27:10.366
pretty bad. I'm not even gonna do it.
I'm just gonna tell 'em I'm sick.

27:11.135 --> 27:13.584
I have to stay home
and take care of my grandma.

27:13.846 --> 27:15.704
- No!
- Yeah.

27:15.864 --> 27:19.298
No, if you're going to dance
in front of people, you have to own it.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.550
- It's stupid. Everyone's gonna laugh.
- So?

27:21.812 --> 27:24.470
- Okay, show me the dance.
- No.

27:24.732 --> 27:26.597
I'll help. I love dancing. Come on.

27:26.859 --> 27:30.598
Whatever, fine. Here, watch.
It's like this. It's like, it's like...

27:32.281 --> 27:35.620
Okay, okay, that's good. But loosen up!

27:38.412 --> 27:39.722
It's loose, it's loose.

27:39.882 --> 27:42.475
'Cause if you don't move your shoulders,
you look like a robot.

27:42.750 --> 27:46.033
- But you have to move your hips.
- But what about the shoulders?

27:46.295 --> 27:48.059
This is how you do it.
You march.

27:49.625 --> 27:51.455
And then hips just side to side.
Do this.

27:51.717 --> 27:53.480
Put your hands on my hips, go.

27:56.472 --> 27:57.936
Like this, side to side.

28:01.678 --> 28:02.675
All right.

28:03.783 --> 28:04.760
See?

28:05.343 --> 28:08.683
- You feel it?
- Yeah, I feel it. It's good, it's fun.

28:08.862 --> 28:09.876
I mean, yeah.

28:11.837 --> 28:13.143
So do it again.

28:14.639 --> 28:15.604
That's good!

28:15.866 --> 28:16.981
Look at those hips!

28:17.740 --> 28:18.732
It's not good.

28:19.117 --> 28:20.109
It's good.

28:39.436 --> 28:41.380
- I got you all wet.
- That's okay.

28:43.915 --> 28:45.665
I'm officially telling Whitmore no.

28:46.830 --> 28:47.844
What?

28:48.122 --> 28:49.430
I'm going pro, mama.

28:49.869 --> 28:52.266
I won't need to finish four years,
'cause when I turn 21,

28:52.572 --> 28:54.184
I'll be signing with the NFL.

28:54.488 --> 28:57.688
I'm going pro and I'm gonna need
to be around people who believe that.

28:57.950 --> 29:00.085
I'm thinking big picture
for this family.

29:01.659 --> 29:04.278
So I'll be going
to my future recruiting meetings alone.

29:05.441 --> 29:06.441
I'm not mad.

29:06.876 --> 29:10.034
I just...
I'm gonna do what I need to do.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.703
Is this because of that girl?

29:13.121 --> 29:16.707
No. I told you it's not like that.

29:17.434 --> 29:18.434
This is me.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.512
I have been thinking about
this Santiago situation.

29:31.007 --> 29:32.765
And I did a little research into him.

29:33.027 --> 29:37.143
Into his background, and
kid has been in juvie twice.

29:37.564 --> 29:39.415
And he's had some violent episodes.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.464
Now what concerns me about
putting a boy like that

29:43.624 --> 29:45.774
back into the foster care system is that

29:45.985 --> 29:47.598
there's just a great risk there.

29:47.777 --> 29:49.990
Especially if he gets into one of those
group homes...

29:50.252 --> 29:53.077
- I understand.
- I mean, I know

29:53.339 --> 29:56.647
that you're looking at him
like he's a great football player.

29:56.947 --> 29:58.999
But I want to make something
clear to you.

29:59.357 --> 30:00.897
This is a boy who needs a home.

30:01.901 --> 30:05.611
- And this is a boy who's at risk.
- I know, Tami.

30:05.771 --> 30:08.247
I mean, I've got three kids.
I know what it takes.

30:10.299 --> 30:12.853
But this is not a kid
like your three kids.

30:13.619 --> 30:15.682
This is a whole different situation.

30:17.982 --> 30:18.982
It's true.

30:19.770 --> 30:22.527
Even though I'm a little bit nervous
about it,

30:22.780 --> 30:24.316
I know I can do this.

30:25.433 --> 30:27.899
And... I really like the kid.

30:28.741 --> 30:32.587
I think he's got a great heart.
I want him to have a chance.

30:34.911 --> 30:35.940
I do too.

30:48.241 --> 30:49.527
Morning, sunshine.

30:49.853 --> 30:53.075
- Can't believe you just did that.
- This coming from the guy

30:53.235 --> 30:55.526
who shows up on my porch
expecting a sleepover.

30:56.432 --> 30:59.268
- Seriously, Tim, I want you gone.
- Do you want some breakfast, Tim?

31:00.503 --> 31:02.354
- Sounds great.
- Shut up! No, he's leaving.

31:02.616 --> 31:03.592
He's leaving.

31:04.495 --> 31:07.593
I can't deal with you here, Tim.
I want you gone.

31:07.871 --> 31:10.112
I'm serious.
I don't have anywhere to go, Tyra.

31:10.374 --> 31:15.075
Oh, right, because your brother's
sleeping with the girl that you used to,

31:15.239 --> 31:19.121
- screw around with? That old lady.
- Good morning, Timmy.

31:19.383 --> 31:21.617
- Good morning, Min.
- I know a guy that's always

31:21.885 --> 31:23.834
looking for people to help him
with his pets.

31:24.096 --> 31:26.180
- I'll give you his number.
- See? There you go.

31:26.419 --> 31:28.547
As good as that sounds,
I may have to check that out.

31:28.809 --> 31:29.840
Today...

31:32.022 --> 31:35.971
- Hey, sweetheart, how's your day going?
- Fine till I read this. You read this?

31:36.274 --> 31:38.932
"Pantherama: Where does the money go?"
By Julie Taylor.

31:39.194 --> 31:42.060
I know. She's been working really hard
on that with that Mr Barnett.

31:42.347 --> 31:45.522
- Have you met that new teacher?
- "Athletic director and Panther's coach

31:45.807 --> 31:48.275
had no comment."
She asked me through the bathroom door.

31:48.537 --> 31:49.649
I was busy.

31:51.403 --> 31:52.551
Sweetheart...

31:53.243 --> 31:55.073
She does make some good points in there.

31:58.727 --> 31:59.703
Bye, honey!

32:03.864 --> 32:04.833
Ms. Williams?

32:08.168 --> 32:10.477
- How are you? Have a seat.
- I'm all right.

32:11.281 --> 32:14.532
I need to know what y'all gonna do
about this recruitment insanity.

32:14.692 --> 32:18.639
My phone is ringing off the hook day and
night. My kid is acting like he needs

32:18.901 --> 32:20.134
a hollywood agent.

32:20.694 --> 32:23.519
Now you told the parents
you were gonna keep an eye on this.

32:24.865 --> 32:27.314
It gets pretty heated up around here
this time of year.

32:28.362 --> 32:29.525
Now wait a second.

32:29.787 --> 32:32.620
These recruiters are pretty aggressive.
I gotta tell you something.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.762
When they see your boy,
they see a prize.

32:34.922 --> 32:36.448
I mean, he's got the talent.

32:36.710 --> 32:39.215
All I can hear about is
how fast he can go pro.

32:39.423 --> 32:41.031
Not one word about his education.

32:41.682 --> 32:44.295
- Not one.
- I can give recommendations.

32:44.727 --> 32:46.077
I can give advice.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.081
But in the long run,

32:49.984 --> 32:53.549
that's a decision that Brian's gonna
be making, or Brian and yourself.

32:53.977 --> 32:56.097
My dead husband was a triflin' man.

32:56.656 --> 32:58.968
I couldn't count on him
to bring his check home,

32:59.128 --> 33:00.556
or to be faithful.

33:01.126 --> 33:03.467
But he was always there for Brian.

33:03.939 --> 33:05.490
They could talk.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.647
Now I'm not asking you
to be this boy's daddy.

33:10.494 --> 33:12.067
I'm just here to remind you

33:12.636 --> 33:14.112
he doesn't have one.

33:18.962 --> 33:22.455
- There's gonna be a great show tonight.
- Ooh, good!

33:23.090 --> 33:24.467
Carlotta helped with it.

33:24.819 --> 33:27.374
- She did?
- Yeah, she's quite the choreographer.

33:27.636 --> 33:28.917
What kind of show, Matthew?

33:29.759 --> 33:33.753
- Kind of a variety show, I guess.
- Good.

33:34.726 --> 33:36.306
Do you realize that Pantherama's

33:36.466 --> 33:39.261
the first social event that Gracie's
ever been to in her entire life?

33:39.915 --> 33:42.185
You really should start saving up
for therapy right now.

33:42.345 --> 33:45.759
Pantherama is tradition,
and tradition is good, sweetheart.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.270
Maybe you could use
some of that positive tradition

33:48.532 --> 33:50.603
in the work
you're doing with your articles.

33:50.868 --> 33:52.566
Noah says you can't have preconceptions

33:52.828 --> 33:54.914
- about an article.
- I don't care what he says.

33:55.078 --> 33:58.330
- Does everybody call him noah?
- Mom, that's his name.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.490
I would think it would be Mr Barnett.

34:00.893 --> 34:04.182
As far as me impinging
on your freedom of the press,

34:04.342 --> 34:06.784
how about you come out
with a little more balance,

34:07.050 --> 34:08.873
more fairness.
What do you think about that?

34:10.554 --> 34:12.501
Welcome everybody to Pantherama!

34:15.893 --> 34:19.259
I want to thank you for coming out
supporting your Dillon panthers!

34:21.327 --> 34:23.382
Is everybody having a good time?

34:25.610 --> 34:27.655
You guys, listen up.
I'll be over here on the side.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.312
If you get out of line
or you need me, I'll be right here.

34:30.676 --> 34:31.855
Don't screw up.

34:32.117 --> 34:33.023
Let's do it.

34:33.389 --> 34:36.275
You guys are gonna be great.
Ready? All right.

34:36.538 --> 34:38.654
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big round of applause for your

34:38.916 --> 34:39.947
Dillon Panthers!

35:48.981 --> 35:50.331
Did you like that?

35:53.338 --> 35:55.731
I always said you had great feet.
You know

35:55.993 --> 35:57.873
- how to move.
- Thank you, grandma.

35:58.033 --> 35:59.249
And you got that from me.

36:00.247 --> 36:02.905
I told coach that I'd stay
and help and clean up.

36:03.065 --> 36:04.226
Well, that's nice.

36:04.386 --> 36:06.241
So I'll be back
in a little bit, all right.

36:06.503 --> 36:07.474
All right.

36:07.634 --> 36:08.647
Here's the keys.

36:09.756 --> 36:11.832
Okay, I'll take it from here.

36:12.266 --> 36:13.540
You looked good out there.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.219
'Cause of you.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.051
I'll see you at the house.

36:33.329 --> 36:35.658
You know, I think we can finish
those bulbs today.

36:35.852 --> 36:38.964
Wouldn't that be great?
Next spring it would be so beautiful.

36:39.124 --> 36:40.650
- Good morning, honey.
- Morning.

36:40.912 --> 36:42.949
Everything looks so good.

36:43.297 --> 36:44.738
This is a good breakfast.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.476
I was thinking about some iris,
'cause we've got day lilies back there.

36:48.804 --> 36:51.369
Y'all probably don't know,
but they look alike.

36:51.888 --> 36:53.984
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:54.728 --> 36:56.625
We need some bone meal.

36:56.887 --> 36:58.960
Matthew, can you help me remember that?
Bone meal.

36:59.222 --> 37:00.295
We might need

37:00.557 --> 37:02.714
some more bulbs.
I don't think I've got that many.

37:02.976 --> 37:05.008
The lady next door said
she'd give me some of hers.

37:05.270 --> 37:07.041
You can thin 'em out.

37:07.702 --> 37:11.765
And that's really a pretty good way
to do it. Just transplant 'em, you know?

37:12.027 --> 37:14.223
Which might be better than bulbs
when you get down it.

37:14.387 --> 37:16.600
'Cause you've already got 'em started.

37:19.416 --> 37:21.566
we're not talking about
a studio apartment here.

37:21.828 --> 37:24.069
- We're talking 3 bedrooms, 2 baths--
- How you doing?

37:24.911 --> 37:26.905
- Coach, how you doing?
- I'm doing fine.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.615
- Good to see you.
- You too.

37:28.877 --> 37:31.284
I make sure you
aren't picking up any of Brian's tab.

37:31.546 --> 37:34.529
Of course, that'd be against
athletic admin rules, wouldn't it?

37:34.691 --> 37:37.404
Yes, it would.
We don't break rules at Miami Southern.

37:37.564 --> 37:41.169
Even if you were gonna buy one of
his tall tale that he's prone to tell,

37:41.431 --> 37:42.838
that could screw up my season.

37:43.424 --> 37:45.819
- It be a damn shame for you.
- Yeah, it sure would, pete.

37:45.979 --> 37:47.212
Well listen, smash,

37:47.479 --> 37:49.886
thanks for the time.
Let's do this again. You got my card.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.162
Coach, always a pleasure.

37:55.779 --> 37:58.879
- What the hell are you doing?
- Okay, fine.

37:59.798 --> 38:03.191
I didn't set up this meeting
through your office. I set it up myself.

38:03.872 --> 38:07.511
Nobody wants all that red tape, coach.
And I don't need you to hold my hand.

38:07.671 --> 38:09.406
I'm grown.
I'm looking at all my options.

38:09.668 --> 38:11.867
I'm trying to make the best decision
for my future.

38:12.918 --> 38:13.918
You got heart...

38:14.969 --> 38:15.969
charisma...

38:16.506 --> 38:17.956
and a lot of skill.

38:18.817 --> 38:21.710
You're probably one of the best athletes
I have ever coached.

38:22.895 --> 38:23.895
Thank you.

38:24.592 --> 38:29.249
My old man gave me a hard time,
every damn decision I ever made.

38:32.459 --> 38:33.847
Every single day I lived

38:34.109 --> 38:35.391
under the roof of that man,

38:36.764 --> 38:38.314
we went head to head.

38:40.949 --> 38:43.440
I'm here.
I just wanted to remind you of that.

38:44.642 --> 38:45.924
You got money?

38:47.275 --> 38:49.905
Good. You buy your own meal.

38:54.396 --> 38:56.878
- Thanks now.
- Sure thing, Coach.

39:09.186 --> 39:11.761
- Who the hell are you?
- Name's Tim Riggins.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.803
What do you want?

39:14.222 --> 39:17.057
Mindy Colette called you
and said I was coming by.

39:20.372 --> 39:22.729
Oh, damn, you're that football guy, huh?

39:23.576 --> 39:24.564
Sorta, yeah.

39:24.826 --> 39:27.228
So you need a place to crash.
So long as you help

39:27.388 --> 39:29.402
take care of Roscoe and Coltrane,
you're welcome.

39:29.895 --> 39:33.323
- Who's that?
- My ferrets. Ferrets better than cats.

39:35.256 --> 39:37.452
Come on in. I'll introduce you.

39:39.108 --> 39:40.497
Come, football boy.

39:44.565 --> 39:45.502
Hey!

39:45.918 --> 39:46.918
Hi.

39:47.766 --> 39:49.881
So I was wondering
about my next assignment.

39:50.625 --> 39:52.384
A glutton for punishment.

39:53.328 --> 39:56.846
When you worked at the paper, how
did you keep coming up with good ideas?

39:57.446 --> 39:59.015
How do you know they were good ideas?

40:00.785 --> 40:02.686
I subscribe to the New York Times.

40:03.851 --> 40:07.273
I read it every day, cover to cover.
You should start by doing that.

40:08.146 --> 40:09.783
We can share this one

40:10.914 --> 40:13.444
And start to get a sense of what makes

40:13.713 --> 40:14.990
a good story.

40:15.856 --> 40:17.498
Um, well, thank you.

40:18.088 --> 40:19.661
Good. Glad I could help.

40:20.962 --> 40:22.512
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:28.431 --> 40:29.578
This is good.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.261
This'll be masculine-lookin'.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.980
Great, uh, hey, babe.

40:34.284 --> 40:37.429
You wanna take these and maybe you
and Santiago can start making up the bed

40:37.691 --> 40:40.390
- and setting up your room.
- Come on.

40:40.947 --> 40:42.728
Buddy. Come here.

40:43.363 --> 40:45.562
I want to see what you got
in the refrigerator,

40:45.824 --> 40:47.852
I need to see what you've got prepared.

40:49.170 --> 40:51.261
- Got everything we need.
- You got a lot of steak,

40:51.421 --> 40:54.625
And a lot of sausage.
Get some vegetables in here.

40:58.407 --> 41:00.243
You're a guardian now. You get me?

41:00.549 --> 41:03.467
You gotta be home when he's home.
He's a kid.

41:04.725 --> 41:06.249
- All right?
- All right.

41:07.338 --> 41:11.185
Why don't you go on in? Make him feel
comfortable, make him feel at home.

41:11.474 --> 41:12.589
Okay, all right.

41:12.857 --> 41:17.091
This is the last time I'm ever gonna be
making your bed.

41:19.316 --> 41:21.348
- Good?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

41:22.819 --> 41:25.435
So this is it.
It's not very roomy, but, uh--

41:25.697 --> 41:28.813
And this was Buddy Junior's desk.
It's small. I'll try to get you a bigger.

41:29.075 --> 41:30.940
But you can work there for now.

41:31.342 --> 41:33.276
I think I'm doing the right thing.

41:36.917 --> 41:38.437
You're doing the right thing.

41:38.710 --> 41:41.159
Got your bathroom, and this is your bed.

41:41.535 --> 41:42.578
Two beds.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.880
I wish it was roomier, Santiago,
but when I moved in,

41:47.218 --> 41:50.651
I really, to tell you the truth,
didn't think it was gonna be that long.

41:51.059 --> 41:52.059
So, but...

41:53.267 --> 41:54.267
This is the...

41:55.920 --> 41:57.220
first real bed I ever had.

42:01.049 --> 42:02.055
Well...

42:02.710 --> 42:03.710
good.

42:04.762 --> 42:05.762
Good then.

42:06.077 --> 42:07.644
Make yourself like home.
