00:15.730 --> 00:20.735
The universe is a vast
and mysterious place,

00:21.821 --> 00:24.531
full of wonder and treachery.

00:25.615 --> 00:30.620
But amid the chaos of
intergalactic life,

00:31.205 --> 00:34.248
there exists an elite group

00:34.250 --> 00:38.835
dedicated to keeping order
and balance:

00:38.837 --> 00:41.089
the Space Guardians!

01:16.667 --> 01:18.751
I'll tell you blokes what,

01:18.753 --> 01:23.505
I know crazy Robo Cat was one
mental metal kitty,

01:23.507 --> 01:26.633
but I've never seen a little
shrimp like Squeak here

01:26.635 --> 01:30.554
handle business like he did with
that sandbox rust bucket.

01:30.556 --> 01:35.517
Three cheers to our newest Space
Guardian, Agent Squeak!

01:35.519 --> 01:37.144
Hear, hear!

01:37.146 --> 01:39.647
Hear, hear!

01:39.649 --> 01:43.150
All right, well then, how
about a little speech,

01:43.152 --> 01:45.738
or somethin' there,
Squeaky, old boy?

01:47.072 --> 01:48.864
So if those were free cheers,

01:48.866 --> 01:51.157
are there cheers I have
to pay for?

01:51.159 --> 01:55.537
What's this craziness you're
talking about now, Squeak?

01:55.539 --> 01:57.665
You said free cheers for the
new Space Guardian.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.749
How much do the
paid cheers cost?

01:59.751 --> 02:02.210
You little prawn!

02:02.212 --> 02:07.049
I didn't say free cheers,
I said three cheers!

02:07.051 --> 02:08.883
Hear, hear!

02:08.886 --> 02:10.388
Hear, hear!

02:11.304 --> 02:14.056
Okay, I'll take it where I
can get it.

02:14.058 --> 02:18.394
Guardian Squeak, on behalf of
all the Space Guardians,

02:18.396 --> 02:20.312
I would like to welcome you

02:20.314 --> 02:23.691
and extend my
deepest congratulations.

02:23.693 --> 02:28.111
Your heroic service is
greatly appreciated.

02:28.113 --> 02:31.073
I couldn't have done it
without you, Master Tekkamaki,

02:31.075 --> 02:32.741
all you guys!

02:32.743 --> 02:33.578
I know!

02:34.494 --> 02:36.247
All right then,
where were we?

02:44.672 --> 02:48.132
You were about to detail a
new top secret threat

02:48.134 --> 02:51.676
to the galaxy that we need to
look into, Captain.

02:51.678 --> 02:54.930
Ah, yes, right, right!

02:54.932 --> 02:58.268
Say, you blokes fancy my belt?

03:00.188 --> 03:02.771
Look at that color there!

03:02.773 --> 03:05.273
If I may interject, Captain,

03:05.275 --> 03:07.735
what does your belt
have to do with...

03:07.737 --> 03:08.943
Look it!

03:08.945 --> 03:10.862
Very nice, sir.

03:10.864 --> 03:12.156
Isn't it?

03:18.080 --> 03:20.580
Oh, blimey, what the
gob was that?

03:20.582 --> 03:22.624
Have we hit a bloody asteroid?

03:22.626 --> 03:24.251
Where's Private Liney?

03:24.253 --> 03:26.253
If he's on that internet again,

03:26.255 --> 03:28.379
I'll demote him to mess hall.

03:28.381 --> 03:29.380
Oh, no!

03:29.382 --> 03:30.633
It sounds like the new
mega-charge

03:30.635 --> 03:32.342
plutonium blaster's blown!

03:32.344 --> 03:34.429
It'll be a small fortune to buy
one new.

03:35.306 --> 03:40.183
Commander Ham Sanders may
know where to find one cheap.

03:40.185 --> 03:42.561
That's what I'm afraid of.

03:42.563 --> 03:44.023
Come in, Agent Pingpongtop.

03:44.856 --> 03:48.818
I need you to run a spacecraft
damage diagnostic pronto!

03:48.820 --> 03:51.611
I feel we've hit
another asteroid.

03:51.613 --> 03:55.157
Your calculation is
incorrect, Captain Ganymede.

03:55.159 --> 03:58.284
It appears as though our rear
outer booster quadrant

03:58.286 --> 04:01.997
has been struck by another
rocket-propelled vessel!

04:01.999 --> 04:07.004
You mean to tell me we've
been rear-ended in space?

04:08.797 --> 04:10.840
Have they finally
finished construction

04:10.842 --> 04:13.008
on the star pool lane?

04:13.010 --> 04:14.551
Negative, Captain.

04:14.553 --> 04:16.344
It appears to be a hit and run.

04:16.346 --> 04:19.139
The other ship has
continued on its way.

04:19.141 --> 04:21.351
Slap my ears and call me.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.937
Not if I have anything to say
about it!

04:25.939 --> 04:28.773
Colonel Rough, deploy the
comet hooks.

04:28.775 --> 04:31.235
We'll nab that hunka
metal and tow it

04:31.237 --> 04:33.278
into the nearest space station

04:33.280 --> 04:37.449
to bring its numpty
captain up on charges.

04:45.417 --> 04:48.586
Well, well, well, what have
we here?

04:48.588 --> 04:50.629
A hunka space debris!

04:50.631 --> 04:54.007
Oh, look, it's the famous
Space Guardians,

04:54.009 --> 04:58.345
floatin' along in their tin can
in the galactic slipstream!

04:58.347 --> 05:02.932
Guess that hero status doesn't
pay the bills, does it?

05:02.934 --> 05:06.562
I'd take our lot over yours
any light year, Tartar.

05:06.564 --> 05:10.440
You're the one who's copping a
flower pot, after all,

05:10.442 --> 05:13.067
and copping it hot.

05:13.069 --> 05:17.572
Ha, you think I accidentally
ran into that recycle bin

05:17.574 --> 05:19.949
you Guardians call a spaceship?

05:19.951 --> 05:22.076
This is your wake up call.

05:22.078 --> 05:24.913
You clowns punk one
little Robo Cat

05:24.915 --> 05:29.250
and fly around like you own the
Milky Way!

05:29.252 --> 05:32.922
Well, then, how 'bout we punk
a big ugly space moose next?

05:32.924 --> 05:36.591
Easy, young Squeak, easy.

05:36.593 --> 05:39.261
Anger is not your friend.

05:39.263 --> 05:41.555
Finally!

05:41.557 --> 05:45.266
I was beginning to think none of
you Star Chickens

05:45.268 --> 05:47.478
were gonna ask me to dance.

05:50.191 --> 05:52.774
Direct hit, we're
being attacked!

05:52.776 --> 05:54.401
Fire the cannons!

05:54.403 --> 05:58.613
If it's a donnybrook he wants,
it's a donnybrook he'll get!

05:58.615 --> 06:02.117
Oh boy, here we go!

06:05.372 --> 06:10.500
Not bad for 21st century
weaponry, Space Germs.

06:10.502 --> 06:14.338
Your lasers might have scratched
my hull.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.716
It's a good thing I also own
controlling stock

06:17.718 --> 06:20.261
in Space Jack's Dents
and Cracks,

06:20.263 --> 06:23.721
but how are you rubes in your
cardboard spaceship

06:23.723 --> 06:25.598
gonna fix this?

06:28.271 --> 06:31.021
Right, is that all
you've got?

06:31.023 --> 06:33.398
Why don't you try this then?

06:33.400 --> 06:36.317
Colonel Rough, fire at will!

06:36.319 --> 06:37.735
As you wish, Captain.

06:41.074 --> 06:43.408
Hmm, what's that?

06:43.410 --> 06:47.997
I didn't know there were
mosquitoes in deep space.

06:47.999 --> 06:51.709
I'll have to remember to pick up
some repellent spray.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.295
You're not foolin' anyone,
mate.

06:54.297 --> 06:57.506
Our lasers are the
best in the galaxy.

06:57.508 --> 07:00.384
We're equipped with not one,
but two

07:00.386 --> 07:02.886
negative mass laser
diode cannons

07:02.888 --> 07:05.514
capable of obliterating
an asteroid

07:05.516 --> 07:07.807
the size of the planet
,

07:07.809 --> 07:10.644
absorbing enough direct fire to
shut down

07:10.646 --> 07:12.771
your ship's navigational system

07:12.773 --> 07:15.483
and short circuit
your mainframe,

07:15.485 --> 07:20.237
leaving your useless metal box
floating helplessly in space

07:20.239 --> 07:22.406
until you collide
with an asteroid,

07:22.408 --> 07:26.660
or a black hole swallows you,
whichever comes first.

07:26.662 --> 07:30.124
The energy you put
into the universe

07:31.542 --> 07:36.547
is the energy the universe
returns to you.

07:37.172 --> 07:39.091
It's the cycle of life.

07:40.134 --> 07:43.554
Payback's a dish best served
cold, Tartar.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.430
Cool beans!

07:46.432 --> 07:49.016
Beans!

07:49.018 --> 07:52.435
I'll keep that all in mind,
Space Guardians.

07:52.437 --> 07:55.064
I just wanted to say hi.

07:55.066 --> 07:56.982
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:56.984 --> 07:59.901
I have to finish buildin'
my new toy.

07:59.903 --> 08:02.822
I think it'll be of great
interest to you.

08:02.824 --> 08:05.574
I call it the Cosmic Inflator.

08:19.256 --> 08:20.673
Warp speed!

08:20.675 --> 08:23.259
We gotta catch that moose!

08:23.261 --> 08:26.553
Captain, warp speed
is not activating!

08:26.555 --> 08:28.056
Our systems appear to be down.

08:29.475 --> 08:32.808
Blimey, if that moose gets
its hooves on that device,

08:32.811 --> 08:34.144
we've had it!

08:34.145 --> 08:37.105
So, the rumors are true.

08:37.107 --> 08:39.607
I'm afraid they are.

08:39.609 --> 08:41.860
Tartar III is building a device

08:41.861 --> 08:44.904
that can destroy
our entire universe

08:44.906 --> 08:47.115
with the push
of a little button.

08:47.117 --> 08:49.871
Whoa, like a space
garbage disposal!

08:51.789 --> 08:53.288
I suppose so, Squeak.

08:53.290 --> 08:55.832
At any rate, this is what
I was meaning

08:55.834 --> 08:57.293
to talk to you about.

08:57.295 --> 08:59.836
Word has reached us that
Tartar's

08:59.838 --> 09:02.756
been developing this device for
some time,

09:02.758 --> 09:04.884
and it's almost ready.

09:04.886 --> 09:07.762
We got an image
of it this morning.

09:07.764 --> 09:12.307
We must not let this device
see fruition.

09:12.309 --> 09:14.559
You can say that again.

09:14.561 --> 09:17.645
We must not let this device
see fruition.

09:17.647 --> 09:20.566
Agent Pingpongtop, what's our
damage rating?

09:20.568 --> 09:22.692
Are we operational?

09:22.694 --> 09:25.863
Captain, my readings show our
rear outer booster quadrant

09:25.865 --> 09:27.907
is operating at 50% power,

09:27.909 --> 09:30.868
while our main thrusters, backup
warp speed engines,

09:30.870 --> 09:34.663
sleeping quarters, heating and
cooling, refrigeration units,

09:34.665 --> 09:38.793
and Game Station Pro
are all dead.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.461
Oh, come on!

09:40.463 --> 09:41.669
No Game Station?

09:41.671 --> 09:42.837
What are we gonna do?

09:42.839 --> 09:44.673
We need to call somebody!

09:44.675 --> 09:47.051
The larger problem seems to
be the fact

09:47.053 --> 09:48.384
that we are now stranded.

09:48.386 --> 09:52.681
We could collide with an asteroid
or slip into a black hole!

09:52.683 --> 09:55.058
Pingpongtop, patch me through

09:55.060 --> 09:57.686
to Agent CUP-K immediately!

09:57.688 --> 09:59.730
Right away, Captain!

09:59.732 --> 10:01.648
Already on it, Captain!

10:01.650 --> 10:04.985
How long till the ship's up
and running, CUP-K?

10:04.987 --> 10:07.113
We're in a bad way, Captain.

10:07.115 --> 10:09.240
We've taken a lot of damage.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.700
How long, CUP-K?

10:11.702 --> 10:15.287
I'd say about a
twelfth of a light year,

10:15.289 --> 10:17.038
maybe less.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.706
A twelfth of a light year?

10:18.708 --> 10:20.875
We'll all be mummies by then!

10:20.877 --> 10:22.669
That's about a month, Squeak.

10:22.671 --> 10:25.714
We'll be bored, but we
won't be mummified,

10:25.716 --> 10:28.842
or you might be if I
ring your neck.

10:28.844 --> 10:30.971
Easy, Colonel Rough, easy!

10:32.305 --> 10:35.432
We're all Space Guardians,
remember?

10:35.434 --> 10:37.770
And the
Space Guardians unite.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.691
Guardians, on screen
before you

10:43.693 --> 10:48.239
is Tartar III's newest weapon,
the Cosmic Inflator.

10:49.156 --> 10:51.907
It looks like a toaster.

10:51.909 --> 10:53.703
A toaster!

10:54.536 --> 10:57.706
I can assure you it is
anything but.

10:59.125 --> 11:03.085
I mean, maybe it can make toast,
I don't know.

11:03.087 --> 11:04.505
Can it spread butter too?

11:05.631 --> 11:09.008
We have no information on
that, Agent Squeak.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.717
What about jelly?

11:10.719 --> 11:12.260
Negative.

11:12.262 --> 11:13.553
Jam?

11:13.555 --> 11:15.264
Okay, come on now!

11:15.266 --> 11:17.265
Let the captain talk.

11:17.267 --> 11:19.851
For crikey's sake, we're
floating around out here

11:19.853 --> 11:22.437
like a discarded soda can!

11:22.439 --> 11:24.775
Soda!

11:26.611 --> 11:27.902
I don't believe this.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.028
Can someone talk to him?

11:30.030 --> 11:31.989
Focus, Squeak.

11:31.991 --> 11:35.160
Remember your lessons learned,
breathe,

11:36.453 --> 11:38.872
and do not lose focus.

11:41.250 --> 11:45.293
I smell toast!

11:45.295 --> 11:48.755
It is an illusion
of the mind.

11:48.757 --> 11:51.926
The power of suggestion is
strong.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.595
Be stronger, Squeak.

11:54.597 --> 11:57.097
Right, where were we?

11:57.099 --> 11:58.975
Yeah, the Cosmic Inflator.

11:59.894 --> 12:01.268
Tell us about it, Captain.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.979
What exactly does that thing do?

12:03.981 --> 12:06.900
You know anything about the
Big Bang Theory?

12:07.859 --> 12:10.443
I don't watch TV.

12:10.445 --> 12:13.404
I think what
Captain Ganymede refer to

12:13.406 --> 12:18.121
is the prevailing cosmological
model for the universe.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.621
Uh, the what?

12:21.623 --> 12:25.250
The Big Bang Theory is the
prevailing notion

12:25.252 --> 12:27.794
of how the universe began.

12:27.796 --> 12:32.466
It all started with a
teeny speck of light.

12:32.468 --> 12:34.176
Then boom!

12:34.178 --> 12:37.263
Rapid expansion saw
the cosmos explode

12:37.265 --> 12:41.600
to this star-studded wonderland
we know today.

12:44.521 --> 12:45.980
Yes?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.063
How do we know that?

12:47.065 --> 12:49.357
If all things started with a
tiny speck of light,

12:49.359 --> 12:50.985
who was around to see it?

12:50.987 --> 12:54.281
You just live to get on our
nerves, don't you?

12:55.116 --> 12:56.782
Good question, Squeak.

12:56.784 --> 12:59.033
Much of what we know
about the Big Bang

12:59.035 --> 13:02.205
comes from mathematical
equations.

13:03.332 --> 13:05.249
We're not gonna do math,
are we?

13:05.251 --> 13:06.792
I hate math.

13:06.794 --> 13:09.211
We're not gonna do math, no.

13:09.213 --> 13:12.049
Just follow me here,
Squeak, pay attention!

13:12.967 --> 13:14.299
What?

13:14.301 --> 13:17.052
Astronomers on Planet Earth,
for instance,

13:17.054 --> 13:21.307
can see the echo of the
universe's rapid inflation

13:21.309 --> 13:23.350
through a phenomenon known as

13:23.352 --> 13:26.644
the cosmic microwave background.

13:28.064 --> 13:28.898
What's that?

13:28.900 --> 13:31.066
Sounds like a damaged airlock!

13:31.068 --> 13:32.902
We could implode!

13:32.904 --> 13:36.154
Remain calm, Colonel Rough.

13:36.156 --> 13:38.240
You remain calm,
Master Tekkamaki!

13:38.242 --> 13:41.203
I fight, and fight hard!

13:42.078 --> 13:42.997
As you wish.

13:47.584 --> 13:48.458
Listen!

13:48.460 --> 13:50.919
There it is again!

13:50.921 --> 13:53.547
It's coming from this area.

13:53.549 --> 13:56.383
Agent Pingpongtop,
run a diagnostics

13:56.385 --> 13:58.885
on our airlocks right away!

13:58.887 --> 14:01.889
Will do, Captain, one moment.

14:01.891 --> 14:03.807
We'll get to the
bottom of this!

14:03.809 --> 14:05.683
There it is again!

14:05.685 --> 14:08.105
It's right here, it's right,

14:09.107 --> 14:11.106
wait a moment!

14:11.108 --> 14:12.942
Is that?

14:12.944 --> 14:13.775
Squeak!

14:13.777 --> 14:16.153
Is that your stomach growling?

14:16.155 --> 14:19.615
Uh, you said microwave.

14:19.617 --> 14:20.865
Oh, blimey!

14:20.867 --> 14:22.909
I don't believe this!

14:22.911 --> 14:25.078
Microwaves cook all kinds of
yummy things!

14:25.080 --> 14:26.663
I haven't had lunch.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.124
I've got the results,
Captain.

14:28.126 --> 14:31.129
All our airlocks
appear to be secure.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.712
Thank you, Agent Pingpongtop.

14:34.714 --> 14:35.800
As you were.

14:36.675 --> 14:40.344
Squeak, you have got to get a
hold of yourself.

14:40.346 --> 14:44.389
This obsession with food is
gonna be your undoing.

14:44.391 --> 14:47.017
I'm sorry, Captain Ganymede,
I'll try!

14:47.019 --> 14:49.519
No try, Squeak,

14:49.521 --> 14:51.938
only do.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.982
Hey, is our microwave
broken too?

14:53.984 --> 14:55.650
Get Pingpongtop back!

14:55.652 --> 14:56.486
Squeak!

14:57.822 --> 14:58.778
What?

14:58.780 --> 15:00.739
I have a bag of pizza bites
that'll go bad

15:00.741 --> 15:02.658
if we don't zap 'em right away!

15:02.660 --> 15:04.409
Enough, Squeak!

15:04.411 --> 15:07.120
Whoa, our survival's
at stake!

15:07.122 --> 15:08.581
Pingpongtop!

15:08.583 --> 15:09.416
Squeak!

15:11.251 --> 15:15.336
As I was saying, a cosmic
microwave background

15:15.338 --> 15:19.383
is traceable leftover radiation
from the Big Bang,

15:19.385 --> 15:22.845
when the universe is
believed to have begun.

15:22.847 --> 15:24.889
Science shmience!

15:24.891 --> 15:27.349
That's not as fun
as pizza bites.

15:27.351 --> 15:29.851
Captain, what does this
device on screen

15:29.853 --> 15:32.520
have to do with the
Big Bang Theory?

15:32.522 --> 15:36.024
I'm glad someone
finally asked.

15:36.026 --> 15:39.445
If Tartar pushes
that button there,

15:39.447 --> 15:43.865
the Cosmic Inflator can bring
about another Big Bang,

15:43.867 --> 15:47.452
effectively destroying our
entire universe

15:47.454 --> 15:50.121
in the blink of an eye.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.793
My goodness,
what shall we do?

15:54.337 --> 15:57.879
Ideally, we'd have caught
Tartar when he attacked us,

15:57.881 --> 16:00.383
and he'd be locked up right now.

16:01.424 --> 16:02.717
But things didn't work
out that way.

16:02.719 --> 16:05.053
We have no choice.

16:05.055 --> 16:07.722
Only one of us here
has proven himself

16:07.724 --> 16:09.559
in a crucial recon mission.

16:10.477 --> 16:12.939
Right, Squeak, you're it.

16:14.649 --> 16:15.815
What now?

16:15.817 --> 16:17.191
Suit up, Guardian.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.360
You foiled crazy Robo Cat.

16:19.362 --> 16:21.447
We need you to find Tartar III

16:22.531 --> 16:24.740
and get that box off of him.

16:24.742 --> 16:26.408
But I haven't had lunch!

16:26.410 --> 16:28.744
Take 15 minutes in the
mess hall,

16:28.746 --> 16:31.746
then report to
Professor Mucus's lab

16:31.748 --> 16:34.124
to get your new
flight instruction.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.543
New flight instruction?

16:35.545 --> 16:38.213
I can't remember the
old flight instruction!

16:42.093 --> 16:44.427
♪ Yeah ♪

16:44.429 --> 16:47.429
♪ I'm not dyin' ♪

16:47.431 --> 16:50.807
♪ Whoa, oh ♪

16:50.809 --> 16:54.644
♪ World goes wild, whoo ♪

16:54.646 --> 16:55.730
Ah, Squeak!

16:56.940 --> 16:59.692
So good to see you again,
you know?

16:59.694 --> 17:03.070
I don't ever recall a
Space Guardian

17:03.072 --> 17:07.490
who took to training as quickly
and efficiently as you.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.325
Really?

17:08.327 --> 17:09.951
That's cool, Professor Mucus.

17:09.953 --> 17:12.288
I wish I could remember
it right now.

17:12.290 --> 17:17.295
You're as funny as
ever, my boy, a true card.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.338
No, really, I...

17:20.714 --> 17:24.717
Look at this, I have a
tremendous new spacecraft

17:24.719 --> 17:26.721
awaiting your skilled hands.

17:27.762 --> 17:29.305
I have no skilled hands,

17:29.307 --> 17:31.182
or anything else,
for that matter.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.059
I call it the ZX239313-3000.

17:37.647 --> 17:41.983
It's capable of a 360-degree
change of direction

17:41.985 --> 17:44.862
within cosmic slipstreams,

17:44.864 --> 17:49.491
enabling it to function within
black holes.

17:49.493 --> 17:52.118
And it has four, count then,

17:52.120 --> 17:55.665
four independent warp
speed engines

17:56.626 --> 17:58.959
built into its boosters,

17:58.961 --> 18:01.878
meaning it uses twice
as much warp

18:01.880 --> 18:04.675
as any other comparable craft,

18:05.675 --> 18:10.346
and will never break down due to
external damage!

18:10.348 --> 18:11.846
Uh,

18:11.848 --> 18:14.517
I was just talking about how I'm
bad at math.

18:14.519 --> 18:16.393
Could you repeat that,
Professor?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.979
That's rich!

18:18.981 --> 18:21.692
At any rate,
you'll love this machine.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.861
And it has brand new
state-of-the-art

18:25.863 --> 18:28.279
galactic facial recognition.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.281
Just input your target,

18:30.283 --> 18:34.077
like a screenshot of
ugly Tartar there,

18:34.079 --> 18:36.788
and the craft will do the rest.

18:36.790 --> 18:40.586
It's capable of identification
up to eight light years,

18:41.419 --> 18:43.797
and reads through masks,

18:45.340 --> 18:47.465
unless they're plutonium-based.

18:47.467 --> 18:49.468
Then it might get confused.

18:49.470 --> 18:52.137
I also modeled the control panel

18:52.139 --> 18:55.766
after our previous time machine,

18:55.768 --> 18:59.019
so just follow the same
navigational instructions

18:59.021 --> 19:02.815
as last time, and you'll be
fine.

19:02.817 --> 19:04.150
That's the thing, Professor,

19:04.152 --> 19:07.027
I really don't remember anything
about that time machine.

19:07.029 --> 19:08.448
I forgot everything.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.573
Everything?

19:10.575 --> 19:12.950
Everything.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.369
Oh my!

19:15.413 --> 19:17.746
What do you recall?

19:17.748 --> 19:18.583
Tacos!

19:20.126 --> 19:21.541
Squeak?

19:21.543 --> 19:22.375
Huh?

19:22.377 --> 19:24.920
Oh, I don't recall anything,
really.

19:24.922 --> 19:26.505
Sorry.

19:26.507 --> 19:31.179
Hmm, this is a strange
development, indeed.

19:32.512 --> 19:35.972
Tell you what, go see
Colonel Rough.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.223
Rough?

19:37.225 --> 19:38.057
But why?

19:38.059 --> 19:39.309
I just saw him!

19:39.311 --> 19:41.561
He doesn't like me anyway.

19:41.563 --> 19:42.395
Nonsense!

19:42.397 --> 19:44.815
He doesn't like anybody.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.442
I know!

19:46.444 --> 19:47.276
Exactly!

19:47.278 --> 19:49.903
It has nothing to do with you.

19:49.905 --> 19:53.117
Go brush up on your flight
simulation training with him

19:53.951 --> 19:57.829
while I simplify some of the
spacecraft's controls.

19:58.705 --> 20:01.289
If you still can't get the hang
of it,

20:01.291 --> 20:03.625
we'll call in reinforcements.

20:03.627 --> 20:05.461
Well, all right.

20:05.463 --> 20:07.630
Hey, if that new spaceship is
ready to go,

20:07.632 --> 20:10.883
why don't we all board it and go
find Tartar together?

20:10.885 --> 20:13.301
Good question, Squeak.

20:13.303 --> 20:15.931
See, I told you you were sharp!

20:16.808 --> 20:19.266
It's a two-seater,
unfortunately,

20:19.268 --> 20:22.811
built for speed and
maneuverability,

20:22.813 --> 20:25.271
not large cargo.

20:25.273 --> 20:29.192
If we loaded it up with all the
Space Guardians,

20:29.194 --> 20:33.239
it would just float helplessly,
like we're doing now.

20:33.241 --> 20:38.246
But you, you have a chance to
save the day yet again!

20:39.329 --> 20:43.958
I know you won't let the
universe down.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.962
I wish I knew it too.

20:47.672 --> 20:50.548
I can't believe we're doing
this again.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.674
I'm a decorated colonel,

20:52.676 --> 20:55.051
and I have to teach a little
blue shrimp

20:55.053 --> 20:58.180
how to fly a spaceship
to save the universe?

20:58.182 --> 21:00.141
What's it all for?

21:00.143 --> 21:02.518
I don't know, Colonel Rough,
you tell me!

21:02.520 --> 21:04.811
I don't know what
good it'll do.

21:04.813 --> 21:08.524
You can't remember anything for
longer than two minutes.

21:08.526 --> 21:12.236
Whoa, it's like a spaceship!

21:25.334 --> 21:27.500
I don't believe this,
Professor!

21:27.502 --> 21:31.672
You mean to tell me you blew up
your lab again?

21:31.674 --> 21:33.715
I don't know what happened!

21:33.717 --> 21:36.134
My equations must have been off.

21:36.136 --> 21:40.221
I merely attempted to reroute
the plutonium intake

21:40.223 --> 21:42.307
around the comet granule
converter tanks

21:42.309 --> 21:45.519
in an effort to make it easier
for Squeak

21:45.521 --> 21:48.396
to switch from engine thrust to
warp speed

21:48.398 --> 21:51.776
without having to activate the
zero gravity clutch and...

21:51.778 --> 21:53.404
Never mind, never mind.

21:54.405 --> 21:55.779
Whatever the reasons,

21:55.781 --> 21:59.032
we're now completely
stranded in space!

21:59.034 --> 22:01.868
We've no way to
send anyone anywhere

22:01.870 --> 22:05.623
and can only float out here and
wait for Tartar III

22:05.625 --> 22:07.249
to blow it all up!

22:07.251 --> 22:10.795
Oh, if you give me a couple
of hours,

22:10.797 --> 22:14.423
I could build another internal
compression glider.

22:14.425 --> 22:15.633
Send Squeak in that.

22:15.635 --> 22:20.011
Like the one you tested with
the gerbil?

22:20.013 --> 22:22.890
Well, similar, not exact.

22:22.892 --> 22:26.143
What happened to that glider
again, Professor?

22:26.145 --> 22:29.980
It confused its
thermostat reading

22:29.982 --> 22:31.692
with its target coordinates,
and...

22:33.360 --> 22:34.902
Go on.

22:34.904 --> 22:36.945
Flew into the sun.

22:36.947 --> 22:38.948
It flew into the sun.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.615
Right, right.

22:40.617 --> 22:43.285
It was just a
mainframe glitch!

22:43.287 --> 22:44.704
More like a hiccup, really,

22:45.623 --> 22:48.414
and the gerbil escaped unhurt.

22:48.416 --> 22:50.416
His escape pod worked perfectly.

22:50.418 --> 22:54.797
Professor, I'm not putting a
Space Guardian in that,

22:54.799 --> 22:56.798
not even Squeak!

22:56.800 --> 23:00.553
No, there's only one call to
make now,

23:00.555 --> 23:03.012
and hopefully, that call
goes through.

23:03.014 --> 23:06.517
Agent Pingpongtop, get me
Commander Ham Sanders

23:06.519 --> 23:08.059
on the line at once!

23:17.821 --> 23:19.779
This 3D is incredible!

23:19.781 --> 23:22.532
These kids today and their
virtual reality games,

23:22.534 --> 23:24.367
this looks just like space!

23:24.369 --> 23:26.202
Just like flying through
deep space

23:26.204 --> 23:29.498
in the Battle of
Saturn's Eighth Ring,

23:29.500 --> 23:31.834
and my platoon got lost in that
black hole,

23:31.836 --> 23:34.836
and I had to fight the entire
sixth regiment

23:34.838 --> 23:37.131
by myself in a modified
baby seat

23:37.133 --> 23:39.884
rigged with one turbo booster
and a laser pen

23:39.886 --> 23:43.679
back when robots were made of
metal, not plasticized PVC.

23:43.681 --> 23:46.182
Ha, what a tremendous game!

23:46.184 --> 23:50.185
This is Captain Ganymede of
the Space Guardians.

23:50.187 --> 23:52.564
You recently helped our new
recruit, Squeak,

23:53.648 --> 23:57.192
defeat that dastardly
crazy Robo Cat.

23:57.194 --> 23:58.443
Robot cat?

23:58.445 --> 24:00.945
No, I don't want to buy any
robot cats.

24:00.947 --> 24:04.784
Is that one of those automated
vacuum cleaners?

24:04.786 --> 24:07.202
Oy vey, what is customer service
coming to?

24:07.204 --> 24:11.457
No, I'm not selling robo
vacuums, Commander!

24:11.459 --> 24:15.251
I'm here with your old partner,
Squeak!

24:15.253 --> 24:16.252
Squeaks?

24:16.254 --> 24:18.255
No, my ship doesn't squeak.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.673
He runs perfectly.

24:19.675 --> 24:22.050
I'm getting tired of
these sales calls.

24:22.052 --> 24:24.553
I'm going to block this number,
do you hear me?

24:24.555 --> 24:26.555
Commander, listen to me!

24:26.557 --> 24:29.224
We're stranded and
we need your help.

24:29.226 --> 24:31.810
I'm going to give
you our coordinates.

24:31.812 --> 24:33.897
Please, come find us if you can!

24:34.816 --> 24:36.856
Are you calling me out, son?

24:36.858 --> 24:39.151
Yes, yes, I am!

24:39.153 --> 24:42.488
The survival of the universe
depends on it!

24:42.490 --> 24:44.949
Then come at me,
space salesman!

24:44.951 --> 24:47.076
I can't, Commander!

24:47.078 --> 24:48.663
You have to come at me!

24:49.871 --> 24:51.622
Why, you grimy star flake!

24:51.624 --> 24:52.914
You've done it now!

24:52.916 --> 24:54.959
You're on Ham Sanders's
bad side!

24:54.961 --> 24:56.167
I'm going to introduce you

24:56.169 --> 24:58.086
to the dark side of the moon,
boy!

24:58.088 --> 25:01.632
Okay, are you ready
for the coordinates?

25:01.634 --> 25:03.217
Do you have a pen?

25:03.219 --> 25:06.220
You'll need more than a pen
to fight me, peewee!

25:06.222 --> 25:08.556
I suggest you find
yourself a sword.

25:08.558 --> 25:10.432
I'm tracking your call
as we speak,

25:10.434 --> 25:12.476
and we'll soon be ship to ship.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.060
Excellent!

25:14.062 --> 25:17.230
We'll see how big your vacuum
mouth is then!

25:17.232 --> 25:20.108
Right then, Commander, see
you shortly.

25:20.110 --> 25:21.445
Fly safe.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.114
Blow it out your exhaust,
whippersnapper!

25:25.116 --> 25:26.699
That went well.

25:26.701 --> 25:29.535
He's gettin' on in years.

25:36.961 --> 25:39.295
Tell me, Agent Squeak,

25:39.297 --> 25:43.885
what have you retained of your
galactic samurai training?

25:46.220 --> 25:48.345
I remember pineapple tacos.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.973
Yet, there were no
pineapple tacos.

25:51.975 --> 25:56.981
The pineapple tacos were a
figment of your mind's eye.

25:57.231 --> 26:00.775
Then my mind's eye sees some
good stuff, Master.

26:00.777 --> 26:05.030
Agent Squeak,
close your eyes.

26:05.906 --> 26:07.323
Uh-huh.

26:07.325 --> 26:11.535
Tell me what you see.

26:11.537 --> 26:14.829
Beef brisket,

26:14.831 --> 26:17.499
steaming mashed potatoes,

26:17.501 --> 26:19.335
a side of fluffy broccoli!

26:19.337 --> 26:20.795
Wow!

26:20.797 --> 26:21.631
Is that all?

26:23.174 --> 26:24.673
Yams!

26:24.675 --> 26:27.386
Agent Squeak, focus your mind

26:28.303 --> 26:31.680
upon our current dilemma.

26:31.682 --> 26:34.517
No power to refrigerate or
microwave in the mess hall,

26:34.519 --> 26:35.728
food spoiling.

26:36.604 --> 26:38.645
There is an enemy.

26:38.647 --> 26:39.482
Think,

26:40.691 --> 26:41.526
what else?

26:42.984 --> 26:45.528
The ice cream, the ice
cream's melted!

26:45.530 --> 26:47.195
The ice cream's gone!

26:47.197 --> 26:50.115
We can refreeze it, we can still
save it all!

26:52.286 --> 26:57.291
If only Tartar's
had developed a tiramisu bomb.

26:59.001 --> 27:00.041
Tiramisu!

27:00.043 --> 27:01.876
Oh, it's to die for!

27:17.854 --> 27:20.395
Colonel Rough, in your
estimation,

27:20.397 --> 27:25.233
is Guardian Squeak adequately
prepared for his new mission?

27:25.235 --> 27:28.570
In my estimation, not at all,
Captain,

27:28.572 --> 27:30.823
not even a little bit.

27:30.825 --> 27:31.659
Oh.

27:32.909 --> 27:36.412
This isn't what I was expecting
to hear.

27:36.414 --> 27:40.374
I'm sure it isn't, Captain,
but the facts remain,

27:40.376 --> 27:43.461
Squeak is quite possibly even
more ill-prepared

27:43.463 --> 27:47.381
for duty than he was
the first time!

27:47.383 --> 27:49.133
I see.

27:49.135 --> 27:52.761
Well, it's a good thing I called
for backup then.

27:52.763 --> 27:53.596
Backup?

27:53.598 --> 27:54.432
Who?

27:56.017 --> 27:57.807
Why don't we cross
that bridge

27:57.809 --> 27:59.684
when we come to it, Guardian?

27:59.686 --> 28:01.811
He has to get here first,

28:01.813 --> 28:03.940
and I'm not convinced he can.

28:05.193 --> 28:06.107
Okay.

28:06.109 --> 28:09.278
In fact, let me check on that
right now.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.945
Agent Pingpongtop?

28:10.947 --> 28:15.409
Nope, why don't we have a
little chat instead?

28:15.411 --> 28:18.788
Tartar, you bleeding rotter!

28:18.790 --> 28:22.208
How'd you tap into
our internal feed?

28:22.210 --> 28:26.295
Easy, Ganymede, all your
firewalls are down.

28:26.297 --> 28:29.464
Your crippled ship's
easy to hack.

28:29.466 --> 28:34.303
I've been watchin' and listenin'
this entire time.

28:34.305 --> 28:37.138
I know every move you're
plannin' to make

28:37.140 --> 28:39.517
almost before you do.

28:39.519 --> 28:41.810
Why, you cloven-hooved lug!

28:41.812 --> 28:44.730
You ought to be dragging fallen
asteroids on Mars

28:44.732 --> 28:47.982
and drinking radioactive water
from a trough!

28:47.984 --> 28:50.152
Listen to you!

28:50.154 --> 28:53.989
And you're supposed to be one of
the good guys?

28:53.991 --> 28:56.450
I'd watch that one close,
Captain.

28:56.452 --> 28:58.911
He's a bad apple!

28:58.913 --> 29:03.624
The only bad apple here is
you, Tartar.

29:03.626 --> 29:06.501
We'll give you one last chance.

29:06.503 --> 29:08.878
Hand over the Cosmic Inflator

29:08.880 --> 29:12.465
and forget about
your evil plans!

29:12.467 --> 29:16.511
Or what, you're gonna sic
that geriatric pipe cleaner,

29:16.513 --> 29:21.474
Commander Ham Sandwich, on me?

29:21.476 --> 29:23.769
Ham sandwich?

29:23.771 --> 29:25.145
Wait, does he mean Ham Sanders?

29:25.147 --> 29:26.230
Is that who you called?

29:26.232 --> 29:29.232
Oy, it is indeed, Squeak.

29:29.234 --> 29:33.362
Whether or not he'll show up is
anyone's guess.

29:33.364 --> 29:34.488
All right, listen up!

29:34.490 --> 29:37.490
Who's the young punk who mans
the phones around here?

29:37.492 --> 29:40.120
Welcome back,
Commander Ham Sanders!

29:42.373 --> 29:46.499
That's not a plutonium grenade
in your hand there, is it?

29:46.501 --> 29:47.710
What?

29:47.712 --> 29:50.462
No, it's a portable nightlight.

29:50.464 --> 29:52.589
My optic chip isn't
what it used to be.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.925
I almost missed a ramp and
walked out into space.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.135
Just checking.

29:57.137 --> 30:00.263
Look here, remember your old
partner, Squeak?

30:00.265 --> 30:02.016
A squeak?

30:02.018 --> 30:04.393
A little whale oil can fix that.

30:04.395 --> 30:05.478
Oh, boy!

30:17.450 --> 30:19.491
It's pretty cool to be flying
together again, Commander.

30:19.493 --> 30:20.701
Nice spaceship!

30:20.703 --> 30:21.743
Where'd you get it?

30:21.745 --> 30:24.121
I traded the Niaks for it.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.122
The Niaks?

30:25.124 --> 30:27.124
I thought you were done dealing
with them!

30:27.126 --> 30:30.795
Yes, well, as you come to
realize in our galaxy,

30:30.797 --> 30:33.087
if you want something and you
want it fast,

30:33.089 --> 30:35.384
the Niaks are the creatures to
talk to.

30:36.424 --> 30:37.425
They didn't rip you off
again, did they?

30:37.427 --> 30:39.595
Squeak, you'll also
come to realize

30:39.597 --> 30:42.222
when you deal with Niaks, it
isn't whether or not

30:42.224 --> 30:44.892
you'll be ripped off, it's how
bad you'll be ripped off.

30:44.894 --> 30:50.021
I paid 53,000 parsecs,
which isn't bad considering.

30:50.023 --> 30:51.774
Considering what?

30:51.776 --> 30:54.692
Considering I hawked crazy
Robo Cat's spacecraft

30:54.694 --> 30:57.738
to the for 60,000
parsecs!

30:57.740 --> 30:59.531
Whoa, cool!

30:59.533 --> 31:01.116
We had a pretty gnarly ship!

31:01.118 --> 31:02.617
Why didn't you just keep it?

31:02.619 --> 31:04.119
Too identifiable.

31:04.121 --> 31:07.623
Crazy Robo Cat had outstanding
warrants in four galaxies.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.583
They'd have stopped
me at every star.

31:09.585 --> 31:12.086
Not to mention, the aliens were
out to get him.

31:12.088 --> 31:13.921
If the good guys
didn't catch me,

31:13.923 --> 31:15.548
the bad guys surely would have!

31:15.550 --> 31:18.386
That's too much trouble for an
old coot like me.

31:19.386 --> 31:20.760
I see your point.

31:20.762 --> 31:23.096
Gentlemen, I trust
your mission's

31:23.098 --> 31:25.266
got off on the right foot.

31:25.268 --> 31:26.392
What?

31:26.394 --> 31:29.144
It's that son of a bleep from
the cleaning company!

31:29.146 --> 31:32.064
I should have cranked his ears
when I had the chance!

31:32.066 --> 31:33.649
That's Captain Ganymede,
Commander.

31:33.651 --> 31:36.609
You know him, he leads
the Space Guardians!

31:36.611 --> 31:38.653
What the, Space Guardians?

31:38.655 --> 31:41.115
Who are they,
a collection agency?

31:41.117 --> 31:44.492
I paid for this ship outright,
free and clear!

31:44.494 --> 31:48.497
Let them try to take it from me,
blasted bean counters!

31:48.499 --> 31:52.334
Squeak, are you sure you can
handle this mission?

31:52.336 --> 31:55.796
I thought it was a good idea to
pair you two again

31:55.798 --> 31:58.465
since you did so
well the last time.

31:58.467 --> 32:00.884
But now,

32:00.886 --> 32:03.345
I'm not so sure.

32:03.347 --> 32:05.346
I've got it under control,
Captain.

32:05.348 --> 32:09.977
Squeak, can you ensure the
commander doesn't go rogue?

32:09.979 --> 32:12.855
Our very survival's at stake.

32:12.857 --> 32:15.441
No worries, Captain,
I've got this.

32:15.443 --> 32:18.529
Meteor shower, pull up,
pull up, Private!

32:19.821 --> 32:20.738
What?

32:20.740 --> 32:23.281
It's okay, Commander,
everything's fine.

32:23.283 --> 32:24.909
We're low on fuel.

32:24.911 --> 32:27.368
Check the fuel gauge, Squeak.

32:27.370 --> 32:29.704
We're not low on fuel!

32:29.706 --> 32:31.289
We're going to crash!

32:31.291 --> 32:32.833
Squeak!

32:32.835 --> 32:36.045
We're not gonna crash,
everything is fine!

32:36.047 --> 32:38.881
I knew I should
have come alone.

32:38.883 --> 32:40.883
I'm switching you off, Private!

32:40.885 --> 32:44.345
Squeak, don't relinquish
the controls!

32:44.347 --> 32:46.346
There's no telling where
you'll end up,

32:46.348 --> 32:50.392
and we must locate Tartar III.

32:50.394 --> 32:52.103
I've lost control, Captain.

32:52.105 --> 32:53.604
Squeak!

32:53.606 --> 32:55.815
It'll work out, just let me
talk to him.

32:55.817 --> 32:57.566
He's overwhelmed right now.

32:57.568 --> 32:59.109
Don't worry, Private,

32:59.111 --> 33:02.113
I'll get us out of this asteroid
storm to safety.

33:02.115 --> 33:04.198
I haven't lost a soldier yet!

33:15.043 --> 33:18.253
Thank
goodness you're here, Commander.

33:18.255 --> 33:19.963
I don't know what I'd have done
without you.

33:19.965 --> 33:22.424
Let's land and wait out this
hellacious storm.

33:22.426 --> 33:24.801
Storm, what storm?

33:24.803 --> 33:27.555
You're suffering from PTSD,
my boy.

33:27.557 --> 33:31.184
There's nothing but stars, far
as the eyes can see.

33:34.771 --> 33:35.606
There it is!

33:36.607 --> 33:38.731
The prison planet looms.

33:38.733 --> 33:40.776
Careful now, Squeak, my boy.

33:40.778 --> 33:44.070
When we land, follow my lead.

33:44.072 --> 33:48.616
I know how to talk to those
things.

33:48.618 --> 33:51.202
Oh, okay.

33:51.204 --> 33:52.371
We're going in!

34:06.762 --> 34:09.429
Greetings, spacelings.

34:09.431 --> 34:10.348
Welcome to,

34:11.266 --> 34:13.476
oh, it's you again!

34:14.603 --> 34:15.521
We come in peace!

34:16.688 --> 34:17.647
Yeah, I know.

34:19.274 --> 34:23.319
You want to sell something
or buy?

34:23.321 --> 34:26.154
If you want to buy, we can talk,

34:26.156 --> 34:31.159
but if you're selling again, we
are closed for business.

34:31.161 --> 34:33.953
Foolish Niaka, the first rule
of business

34:33.955 --> 34:35.996
is never close for business!

34:35.998 --> 34:39.000
Yeah, well, that ship you
sold us

34:39.002 --> 34:43.672
is so full of steel wool
fur balls, it won't take off!

34:44.966 --> 34:46.882
How is that my problem?

34:46.885 --> 34:50.719
I paid you 60,000 parsecs

34:50.722 --> 34:53.350
for a ship that won't fly,
that's how.

34:54.310 --> 34:57.018
Nonsense, I flew it here.

34:57.021 --> 35:01.439
And you crash landed over the
North Hills.

35:01.441 --> 35:04.192
We had to carry you back
to our camp

35:04.194 --> 35:06.405
and nurse you back to health,
remember?

35:07.490 --> 35:09.448
No, I don't recall that.

35:09.450 --> 35:12.450
I'm not surprised.

35:12.452 --> 35:16.622
Your memory chip was so damaged
in the crash,

35:16.624 --> 35:20.292
on top of its existing
wear and tear,

35:20.294 --> 35:23.379
we thought you'd never
come around!

35:23.381 --> 35:27.049
Niaka was ready to dismantle you

35:27.051 --> 35:30.886
and sell you to the
intergalactic space dump.

35:30.888 --> 35:32.220
Niaka?

35:32.222 --> 35:35.223
But you're Niaka!

35:35.225 --> 35:36.975
Not this again!

35:36.977 --> 35:38.061
Not me, him.

35:39.981 --> 35:43.399
Private, don't panic, but I
am seeing double.

35:43.401 --> 35:45.734
There's two of them,
Commander.

35:45.736 --> 35:47.361
Oh!

35:47.363 --> 35:50.281
What do you want this time,
Ham Sanders?

35:50.283 --> 35:54.075
Yeah, what are you selling,
this shrimp?

35:54.077 --> 35:55.285
Hey!

35:55.287 --> 35:58.747
Go with it,
Private, it'll get us inside.

35:58.749 --> 36:00.417
Then we can rescue Marlenia.

36:01.419 --> 36:03.042
What, Marlenia?

36:03.044 --> 36:04.462
She's not here!

36:04.464 --> 36:07.923
Yes, this prime shrimp here
is juicy,

36:07.925 --> 36:10.926
succulent, and ready
for the barbie!

36:10.928 --> 36:11.761
What?

36:11.763 --> 36:12.970
Want to see?

36:12.972 --> 36:15.513
Here, fire it up, throw him on!

36:15.515 --> 36:19.142
Better shrimp, you won't find on
planet Niak!

36:19.144 --> 36:21.312
What a comedian.

36:21.314 --> 36:22.937
Commander, you're a real card.

36:22.939 --> 36:25.941
But seriously, guys, somebody's
completely out of his mind,

36:25.943 --> 36:27.567
and landed here for
no good reason.

36:27.569 --> 36:30.571
Don't mind us,
we'll just be going.

36:30.573 --> 36:32.531
Sorry for the intrusion, Niaks!

36:32.533 --> 36:33.573
Oh?

36:33.575 --> 36:35.827
I'm actually pretty hungry.

36:37.287 --> 36:39.037
Me too, Niaka.

36:39.039 --> 36:41.624
Shrimp was sounding mighty good.

36:41.626 --> 36:42.459
Me three!

36:44.086 --> 36:45.294
Me four!

36:45.296 --> 36:47.296
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp!

36:47.298 --> 36:49.631
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp!

36:49.633 --> 36:51.549
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp!

36:51.551 --> 36:53.426
Okay, come on now.

36:53.428 --> 36:54.970
Bidding's open.

36:54.972 --> 36:57.305
How much for this plump morsel?

36:57.307 --> 36:59.433
I'll take 10 parsecs!

36:59.435 --> 37:00.975
Sold!

37:00.977 --> 37:01.812
No!

37:03.356 --> 37:05.939
Sold to Niaka for 10 parsecs.

37:05.941 --> 37:06.983
But I'm Niaka!

37:08.318 --> 37:10.151
But I'm Niaka!

37:10.153 --> 37:12.238
No, I'm Niaka!

37:12.240 --> 37:14.156
Then you all win.

37:14.158 --> 37:17.993
Somebody just give me 10
parsecs, I don't care who.

37:17.995 --> 37:20.453
I'll give you 20 parsecs to
get us back in the ship

37:20.455 --> 37:21.913
and blast off!

37:21.915 --> 37:23.832
20 parsecs?

37:23.834 --> 37:25.542
Wait a minute, Ham Sanders,

37:25.544 --> 37:26.628
a deal's a deal.

37:29.131 --> 37:30.673
Zip it, Niak!

37:30.675 --> 37:33.758
Well, I need to
think this through.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.678
Let's think it through in the
cockpit, yeah?

37:36.680 --> 37:39.348
Ham Sanders, if you renege,

37:39.350 --> 37:44.355
you better never show your sheet
metal on this planet again!

37:44.689 --> 37:46.229
Is that a threat?

37:46.231 --> 37:48.524
It's a promise!

37:48.526 --> 37:49.359
Well,

37:50.444 --> 37:53.111
you Niakas have been outbid.

37:53.113 --> 37:54.904
20 parsecs wins.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.531
Pay up, Squeak.

37:56.533 --> 37:59.493
Um, can I pay you
when we get back

37:59.495 --> 38:01.370
to Space Guardian headquarters?

38:01.372 --> 38:03.747
All right.

38:05.209 --> 38:07.750
We won't forget this,
Ham Sanders.

38:07.752 --> 38:11.254
If you ever have the bolts to
come back to Niak,

38:11.256 --> 38:14.299
it's the junk pile for you,
mister.

38:14.301 --> 38:17.678
I can't even remember why I
came here in the first place!

38:17.680 --> 38:20.598
I'm not sure I could even find
my way back.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.808
Let's go, Commander,
time's a-wastin'.

38:22.810 --> 38:24.350
If you say so.

38:36.115 --> 38:38.448
Thanks for not leaving me
with those Niakas, Commander.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.075
I knew you wouldn't sell me out.

38:40.077 --> 38:43.037
Oh, we forget Marlenia!

38:43.039 --> 38:44.830
She's in grave danger!

38:44.832 --> 38:47.415
The Niakas are
holding her captive!

38:47.417 --> 38:48.917
We must go back.

38:48.919 --> 38:51.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no!

38:51.671 --> 38:52.879
We can't go back.

38:52.881 --> 38:54.089
Remember what they said?

38:54.091 --> 38:57.176
They'll sell you for parts, and
they'll have me for lunch!

38:57.178 --> 38:59.970
A hero shows no fear,
Private.

38:59.972 --> 39:04.558
We're at war, and I never leave
a soldier behind.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.267
We're not at war.

39:06.269 --> 39:07.435
Marlenia's safe.

39:07.437 --> 39:09.437
I had dinner with her just the
other night.

39:09.439 --> 39:10.939
Nonsense!

39:10.941 --> 39:13.024
I'll show you, we'll call her
right now.

39:13.026 --> 39:15.819
Just whatever you do, don't take
us back to Niak.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.781
Telemaginator, Telemaginator?

39:18.783 --> 39:22.743
Ah-ha, this craft's
Telemaginator is hardwired

39:22.745 --> 39:26.788
to respond to my
voice commands only!

39:26.790 --> 39:29.792
Fine, just call her, and I'll
prove she's okay.

39:29.794 --> 39:31.459
Telemaginator.

39:31.461 --> 39:33.629
Yes, Commander
Ham Sanders?

39:33.631 --> 39:36.048
Patch me through to
Marlenia Sheep.

39:36.050 --> 39:37.466
Do you
mean Marlenia,

39:37.468 --> 39:40.468
the galactic rebel of the
Crutonian army?

39:40.470 --> 39:41.803
That's the one!

39:41.805 --> 39:43.973
Connecting to Marlenia.

39:43.975 --> 39:45.640
Thank you!

39:45.642 --> 39:47.642
Well, if it isn't my
favorite duo.

39:47.644 --> 39:50.812
What are you two doing back
together, saving the universe?

39:50.814 --> 39:51.980
Actually, uh...

39:51.982 --> 39:54.399
Marlenia, are you all right?

39:54.401 --> 39:55.901
Have they hurt you?

39:55.903 --> 39:57.403
Has who hurt me?

39:57.405 --> 39:59.654
Those blasted Niakas!

39:59.656 --> 40:02.491
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

40:02.493 --> 40:04.618
Marlenia, have you
intercepted any distress signals

40:04.620 --> 40:06.370
from Space Guardian
headquarters?

40:06.372 --> 40:07.370
No, why?

40:07.372 --> 40:08.705
Is there trouble?

40:08.707 --> 40:09.915
Big trouble!

40:09.917 --> 40:11.625
Tartar III has
developed a device

40:11.627 --> 40:13.461
that can obliterate
the entire universe

40:13.463 --> 40:14.962
with the push of a button!

40:14.964 --> 40:17.298
He attacked us and
disabled our ship.

40:17.300 --> 40:20.593
Well, that and Professor Mucus
blew up his lab again.

40:20.595 --> 40:22.678
Anyway, the Guardians are
stranded in space

40:22.680 --> 40:25.346
while Ham Sanders and I try to
catch Tartar!

40:25.348 --> 40:26.723
Oh, no!

40:26.725 --> 40:29.267
This is the first time
hearing of this!

40:29.269 --> 40:30.644
If you could locate the
Guardians

40:30.646 --> 40:32.354
and help them get the ship up
and running,

40:32.356 --> 40:34.189
I'd owe you a big one.

40:34.191 --> 40:37.192
Oh, threaten me with a good
time, why don't you?

40:37.194 --> 40:39.361
I'm on it, I'll let you know
when I find them.

40:39.363 --> 40:40.488
Are you two gonna be okay

40:40.490 --> 40:42.573
chasing after Tartar
by yourselves?

40:42.575 --> 40:43.741
Okay?

40:43.743 --> 40:47.535
I defeated 600 radioactive
Stardust Phantoms by myself

40:47.537 --> 40:49.497
when I was separated
from my platoon

40:49.499 --> 40:51.832
during the War of
Saturn's Two Moons.

40:51.834 --> 40:52.957
I know, Commander.

40:52.959 --> 40:55.711
You remind me every
time I see you.

40:55.713 --> 40:57.504
Thanks a million, Marlenia.

40:57.506 --> 41:00.381
Yeah, yeah, you owe me
another dinner for this, Squeak.

41:00.383 --> 41:01.591
Deal!

41:01.593 --> 41:04.553
I know a great Italian bistro
on Planet Niak.

41:04.555 --> 41:06.263
We could all go!

41:06.265 --> 41:07.807
No!

41:07.809 --> 41:08.973
No.

41:08.975 --> 41:10.852
What, is three a crowd?

41:27.410 --> 41:29.245
And then I had to think fast,

41:29.247 --> 41:32.330
so what I did is I
camouflaged myself

41:32.332 --> 41:33.915
as the ship's exhaust tubing.

41:33.917 --> 41:37.461
I stood real still and watched
those space crabs

41:37.463 --> 41:38.796
crawl right by me.

41:38.798 --> 41:41.589
I can still see their
gigantic pincers

41:41.591 --> 41:43.258
mere inches from my throat.

41:43.260 --> 41:45.345
I still get the
nightmare sometimes,

41:46.388 --> 41:49.434
but I will say the whale oil
helps with that.

42:05.950 --> 42:07.241
Squeak?

42:08.952 --> 42:09.868
Huh?

42:09.870 --> 42:11.078
What?

42:11.080 --> 42:12.412
Up and at 'em, Private.

42:12.414 --> 42:14.622
It looks like we have a visitor.

42:14.624 --> 42:18.461
Well, what have we here?

42:18.463 --> 42:20.296
A couple of haters?

42:20.298 --> 42:23.841
A couple of haters!

42:23.843 --> 42:25.801
A couple of Guardians
is more like it.

42:25.803 --> 42:29.138
Space Guardians, we're comin'
for you, Tartar!

42:29.140 --> 42:32.015
There's nowhere to run and
nowhere to hide!

42:32.017 --> 42:34.310
Ooh!

42:34.312 --> 42:37.312
I'm scared, little blue shrimp!

42:37.314 --> 42:40.316
Quakin' in my hooves
over the justice

42:40.318 --> 42:42.401
you're about to meet out.

42:42.403 --> 42:45.321
You'd better be,
you fat reindeer.

42:45.323 --> 42:46.654
I'm a veteran, you know?

42:46.656 --> 42:49.741
I was taking shrapnel in
war-torn galaxies

42:49.743 --> 42:51.785
and solar systems before you
were learning

42:51.787 --> 42:53.995
to walk on your knock knees.

42:53.997 --> 42:56.540
You wanna go, tin man?

42:56.542 --> 42:57.707
What?

43:00.671 --> 43:01.921
He's attacking!

43:01.923 --> 43:02.754
We're hit!

43:04.591 --> 43:06.299
I've raised our
defense shields,

43:06.301 --> 43:09.303
but they can only
withstand so much.

43:11.390 --> 43:13.973
Return fire,
we have to return fire!

43:13.975 --> 43:16.142
See that button to your left?

43:16.144 --> 43:17.185
Yeah.

43:17.187 --> 43:18.187
Press it!

43:22.151 --> 43:23.859
Take that!

43:25.530 --> 43:26.779
That's it?

43:26.781 --> 43:30.281
And I thought your precious
Space Guardian ship was weak.

43:30.283 --> 43:33.743
What have you got there,
pea shooters?

43:33.745 --> 43:38.624
Oh-ho, you want to try
something stronger, do you?

43:38.626 --> 43:39.667
Try this.

43:49.803 --> 43:53.305
Colonel Rough, I've kept it
from the rest of the crew

43:53.307 --> 43:56.892
as best I can, but I'm going to
level with you.

43:56.894 --> 44:01.062
I'm concerned about our
chances here.

44:01.064 --> 44:03.232
Captain, if it's
worth anything,

44:03.234 --> 44:07.903
I don't believe Tartar III would
actually press that button.

44:07.905 --> 44:10.865
I think the
big moose is bluffing.

44:10.867 --> 44:13.033
I hope you're right.

44:13.035 --> 44:15.578
Either way, one
thing's for sure,

44:15.580 --> 44:18.913
until we fix this ship, we're
not guardians

44:18.915 --> 44:20.957
of nothin' out here.

44:20.959 --> 44:24.086
We're just space sittin' ducks.

44:24.088 --> 44:25.296
Knock, knock.

44:25.298 --> 44:27.133
Who's there?

44:28.468 --> 44:30.593
Just your friendly
neighborhood space rebel.

44:30.595 --> 44:32.970
I hear my Guardians are
in a bit of a jam.

44:32.972 --> 44:34.555
You heard right.

44:34.557 --> 44:36.767
Good to see you again, Marlenia.

44:37.769 --> 44:38.895
How have you been?

44:39.937 --> 44:40.895
Better than you.

44:40.897 --> 44:42.645
Tartar III, huh?

44:42.647 --> 44:43.482
Aye.

44:44.524 --> 44:47.567
He turned into a big problem
right quick.

44:47.569 --> 44:49.111
Think he's gonna
push the button?

44:49.113 --> 44:51.656
Not if we have
anything to add.

44:52.783 --> 44:55.325
Well, let's get you back into
the equation.

44:55.327 --> 44:58.412
That's music to my ears!

44:58.414 --> 44:59.874
You have nice ears.

45:00.874 --> 45:04.419
Flattery will get you
everywhere, my dear.

45:05.504 --> 45:07.212
First thing's first, let's
pop the hood

45:07.214 --> 45:09.298
and get you guys operational.

45:09.300 --> 45:10.799
Have a go, miss.

45:15.222 --> 45:16.846
Commander, our boosters
are damaged!

45:16.848 --> 45:18.598
Our reserve fuel
tanks are ruptured!

45:18.600 --> 45:20.392
Our radar detection is disabled!

45:22.729 --> 45:25.480
What's the other
guy look like?

45:25.482 --> 45:26.982
Ugly.

45:26.984 --> 45:30.236
Dagnabbit, I just
bought this ship!

45:33.615 --> 45:35.658
Hang on, Commander, there's a
call coming through.

45:35.660 --> 45:37.660
It's Captain Ganymede!

45:37.662 --> 45:40.120
How goes it, Agent Squeak?

45:40.122 --> 45:41.832
Any luck locating Tartar?

45:42.792 --> 45:44.917
I'd say we're havin' a lotta
luck, Captain.

45:47.379 --> 45:49.339
Is that an alarm I hear?

45:50.383 --> 45:51.674
No, alarms here.

45:51.676 --> 45:53.886
We're just playing
our music loud.

45:54.761 --> 45:56.428
We're rocking out.

45:56.430 --> 45:57.888
Thanks for checking in, Captain.

45:57.890 --> 45:59.890
We'll inform you of any news.

45:59.892 --> 46:00.935
Over and out.

46:03.019 --> 46:04.102
Hey!

46:04.104 --> 46:05.687
You dumped the Captain!

46:05.689 --> 46:06.647
That's right.

46:06.649 --> 46:07.857
In case you haven't noticed,

46:07.859 --> 46:11.109
we kind of have a lot
going on right now.

46:11.111 --> 46:13.404
But the Captain's in charge!

46:13.406 --> 46:16.615
Is the Captain in this
firefight with us?

46:16.617 --> 46:18.491
Well, no.

46:18.493 --> 46:19.993
Then we're in charge!

46:19.995 --> 46:21.537
Keep firing, Squeak!

46:24.709 --> 46:27.042
Cease fire, Guardians.

46:27.044 --> 46:28.586
That's the Cosmic Inflator.

46:28.588 --> 46:31.589
If he pushes that button,
we all go boom!

46:31.591 --> 46:33.968
Better do as the fat
reindeer says.

46:41.184 --> 46:43.850
Now, wasn't that easy?

46:43.852 --> 46:45.895
I could get used to this.

46:45.897 --> 46:50.899
I utter commands, and you Space
Guardians obey.

46:50.901 --> 46:52.901
Don't get used to it.

46:52.903 --> 46:54.070
Yeah, fatso!

46:54.906 --> 46:56.866
Okay, you know what?

46:59.118 --> 47:01.118
Where's Commander
Ham Sanders?

47:01.120 --> 47:02.745
What have you done with him?

47:02.747 --> 47:04.913
I'd like to say I blasted him

47:04.915 --> 47:07.875
into minuscule
metallic dust particles

47:07.877 --> 47:11.754
and he's floatin' for all
eternity in Saturn's fourth ring,

47:11.756 --> 47:14.214
but sadly, that's not so.

47:14.216 --> 47:16.549
It's just a nifty
little function

47:16.551 --> 47:19.261
of my Cosmic Inflator, shrimp.

47:19.263 --> 47:21.846
I can make objects explode,

47:21.848 --> 47:26.267
or I can make objects implode,
whichever I choose.

47:26.269 --> 47:30.022
I imploded your creaky little
rust bucket friend

47:30.024 --> 47:34.987
into a junk particle too small
for the eye to even see,

47:35.488 --> 47:40.281
like a super-powered junkyard
metal compactor.

47:40.283 --> 47:43.745
Crunch!

47:45.122 --> 47:47.413
Wait a minute, I've seen
this before.

47:47.415 --> 47:49.792
You can't get rid of Commander
Ham Sanders like that!

47:49.794 --> 47:50.792
He's a...

47:52.338 --> 47:53.171
A hologram!

47:54.631 --> 47:57.091
Shut the front door!

47:57.093 --> 47:57.924
What?

47:57.926 --> 47:58.968
Is the airlock open?

47:58.970 --> 48:00.886
We'll be sucked
into outer space!

48:00.888 --> 48:02.971
The airlock is fine, Squeak.

48:02.973 --> 48:05.098
Read your control settings.

48:05.100 --> 48:08.435
Oh, nice try, Tartar.

48:08.437 --> 48:09.564
The joke's on you.

48:10.772 --> 48:13.524
My original machinery was
obliterated

48:13.526 --> 48:16.192
in the space
battle of 10...

48:16.194 --> 48:18.654
10,000,054.

48:18.656 --> 48:20.156
I remember now.

48:20.158 --> 48:23.033
How 'bout this, I'll press the
red button

48:23.035 --> 48:26.162
and initiate a second Big Bang,

48:26.164 --> 48:28.372
destroying everything
in the universe

48:28.374 --> 48:31.500
in the blink of an eye, your
hologram included.

48:31.502 --> 48:33.544
Nothing survives!

48:33.546 --> 48:36.171
If you do that, you'll
destroy yourself too!

48:36.173 --> 48:38.758
What kind of a villain
would I be

48:38.760 --> 48:42.845
if I wasn't willing to perish
for the cause?

48:42.847 --> 48:44.513
A smart one.

48:44.515 --> 48:46.723
Shut up, metal mouth.

48:46.725 --> 48:48.142
Good one, Commander.

48:48.144 --> 48:49.350
No, it wasn't!

48:49.352 --> 48:51.020
It wasn't good at all!

48:51.022 --> 48:53.772
It was stupid, like you!

48:53.774 --> 48:56.609
No, you're stupid!

48:56.611 --> 48:59.361
Squeak, your mind
is powerful,

48:59.363 --> 49:01.696
more powerful than you realize.

49:01.698 --> 49:04.491
Remember how you defeated crazy
Robo Cat?

49:04.493 --> 49:06.287
Don't let him distract you.

49:07.370 --> 49:10.455
Focus, concentrate!

49:10.457 --> 49:11.665
Huh?

49:11.667 --> 49:14.459
Focus, concentrate!

49:14.461 --> 49:16.544
Activate the power of your mind.

49:16.546 --> 49:18.839
Oh, okay.

49:18.841 --> 49:20.091
Here goes nothin'.

49:24.555 --> 49:26.305
Oy vey!

49:39.694 --> 49:41.569
How's it coming, Marlenia?

49:41.571 --> 49:45.950
Can we be rebooted, or will we
have to abandon ship?

49:45.952 --> 49:48.410
I'll have you Guardians back
in action shortly, Captain.

49:48.412 --> 49:49.953
Just a bit more booster work

49:49.955 --> 49:52.665
and a few more optical
fibers to connect.

49:52.667 --> 49:55.375
Right then, keep us posted.

49:55.377 --> 49:58.002
Squeak, Squeak!

49:58.004 --> 50:03.133
I've repeatedly attempted
to contact Agent Squeak,

50:03.135 --> 50:04.926
but he isn't answering.

50:04.928 --> 50:07.763
Gentlemen, I fear
Commander Ham Sanders

50:07.765 --> 50:10.765
may have gone rogue once again.

50:10.767 --> 50:12.685
This is what I was afraid of.

50:12.687 --> 50:15.812
I knew we shouldn't have called
in that bucket of bolts

50:15.814 --> 50:16.941
a second time.

50:17.899 --> 50:20.567
It was my judgment call,
Professor,

50:20.569 --> 50:24.071
and frankly, none of you wanted
to work with Squeak,

50:24.073 --> 50:25.656
so I had no choice.

50:25.658 --> 50:27.825
He couldn't go it alone.

50:27.827 --> 50:30.995
Young Squeak can
work miracles

50:30.997 --> 50:35.707
if only he trusts
his mind's eye.

50:35.709 --> 50:38.961
Well, for the sake
of the universe,

50:38.963 --> 50:41.504
let's hope that shrimp's
trusting his mind's eye

50:41.506 --> 50:43.050
like crazy right now.

50:44.051 --> 50:44.927
Squeak!

50:46.053 --> 50:47.553
Squeak!

50:47.555 --> 50:49.638
Can you hear me?

50:49.640 --> 50:54.058
My boy, think of what you want
the most right now.

50:54.060 --> 50:58.814
Actualize your imagination,
don't break concentration!

50:58.816 --> 51:02.734
And whatever you do, don't think
about food, Squeak.

51:02.736 --> 51:06.823
Remember our mission, do not
think about food!

51:07.783 --> 51:09.160
Concentrate

51:10.243 --> 51:12.204
on the mission.

51:13.205 --> 51:14.580
The mission!

51:18.169 --> 51:20.627
What the shooting stars?

51:20.629 --> 51:22.212
Where did he come from?

51:22.214 --> 51:26.926
Ah, Agent Squeak has finally
harnessed the power

51:26.928 --> 51:29.470
of his mind.

51:29.472 --> 51:31.640
Squeak, can you hear me?

51:33.767 --> 51:36.269
Squeak, it's Captain Ganymede.

51:37.146 --> 51:39.312
Can you hear me?

51:39.314 --> 51:42.357
He teleported his
image to us,

51:42.359 --> 51:45.361
but has not linked his
consciousness.

51:45.363 --> 51:48.531
We must make his
subconscious mind

51:48.533 --> 51:52.200
aware of his surroundings.

51:52.202 --> 51:54.370
How do we do that?

51:54.372 --> 51:59.542
Speak of something he has a
strong reaction to.

51:59.544 --> 52:04.173
It will awaken his senses and
engage him with us.

52:05.383 --> 52:08.091
Squeak, the universe is still
in peril.

52:08.093 --> 52:10.718
Have you located the
Cosmic Inflator?

52:10.720 --> 52:12.053
That won't do it.

52:12.055 --> 52:13.555
Try this.

52:13.557 --> 52:16.475
Agent Squeak, dinner's ready!

52:16.477 --> 52:18.644
Mm, I'm starving!

52:18.646 --> 52:19.812
What are we having?

52:19.814 --> 52:22.605
Something good, I'm sure.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.232
It'll be ready in a minute.

52:24.234 --> 52:27.903
What brings you back
here to us, Squeak?

52:27.905 --> 52:29.154
The mission!

52:29.156 --> 52:31.158
Have you news to report?

52:32.368 --> 52:36.412
We found Tartar III, or he
found us.

52:36.414 --> 52:38.622
What about the
Cosmic Inflator?

52:38.624 --> 52:40.374
Where is it now?

52:40.376 --> 52:42.834
With Tartar, I think he's
about to press the button.

52:42.836 --> 52:46.296
That isn't helpful at all!

52:46.298 --> 52:51.303
Squeak, where is your
physical body located right now?

52:51.636 --> 52:54.053
Our ship is nearly operational.

52:54.055 --> 52:56.682
We can catch up to you and join
the fight

52:56.684 --> 52:59.058
if you need reinforcements.

52:59.060 --> 53:00.935
I'm in Commander Ham
Sanders's ship.

53:00.937 --> 53:04.105
I know, Squeak, but where?

53:04.107 --> 53:07.609
Where can we find Ham Sanders?

53:07.611 --> 53:09.236
Ham Sanders was
blasted to smithereens

53:09.238 --> 53:11.781
in the space battle of
10,000,54,

53:11.783 --> 53:14.658
and his parts are scattered
throughout the Rubian Galaxy.

53:14.660 --> 53:17.578
It would take a long time to
collect them all.

53:18.747 --> 53:23.461
In this state, Squeak is
captive to his literal mind.

53:24.127 --> 53:26.629
To receive the proper answer,

53:26.631 --> 53:29.634
we must ask it
a proper question.

53:30.635 --> 53:33.468
Right, Squeak, tell us where
we can find

53:33.470 --> 53:36.638
your physical body right now!

53:36.640 --> 53:39.100
In Commander Ham
Sanders's ship.

53:39.102 --> 53:41.310
I can't, I just can't!

53:41.312 --> 53:44.687
This shrimp's mind is the
blackest of black holes.

53:44.689 --> 53:49.694
Agent Squeak, exactly where
is the ship located now?

53:51.906 --> 53:53.531
Right next to
Tartar III's ship,

53:53.533 --> 53:55.491
at the edge of the
star cluster,

53:55.493 --> 53:57.325
near the wormhole.

53:57.327 --> 54:00.037
That's Admiral
Tumble's jurisdiction.

54:00.039 --> 54:01.497
They're facing off!

54:01.499 --> 54:02.872
This is it then.

54:02.874 --> 54:04.875
Marlenia, come in!

54:04.877 --> 54:08.169
How are those repairs coming,
sweetheart?

54:08.171 --> 54:09.546
Finishing up now, Captain.

54:09.548 --> 54:12.006
Your boosters should be
operational in just a sec.

54:12.008 --> 54:13.508
Squeak, you're back!

54:13.510 --> 54:15.845
Don't forget that dinner you
promised me.

54:15.847 --> 54:18.180
Dinner!

54:33.573 --> 54:36.115
Greetings, Admiral Tumble.

54:36.117 --> 54:39.660
I hope this transmission finds
you well.

54:39.662 --> 54:44.247
I'd be a star
side better

54:44.249 --> 54:49.336
if a certain captain I know paid
his debts.

54:49.338 --> 54:54.343
Come on
now, old chap.

54:54.593 --> 54:58.722
That old card game was an astro
year ago.

55:00.140 --> 55:05.146
An astro year, 20 cosmo
minutes, and 45 meteor seconds.

55:08.441 --> 55:09.484
What's your point?

55:10.401 --> 55:14.444
Can we let bygones
be bygones then?

55:14.446 --> 55:16.781
It depends if you're ready

55:16.783 --> 55:20.453
to hand over that ship of yours.

55:21.412 --> 55:26.417
Space Guardian duty requires
a proper craft for the job.

55:26.709 --> 55:28.167
You know that!

55:28.169 --> 55:32.964
And you know you lost that
hand fair and square.

55:34.883 --> 55:38.343
I never argue that,
Admiral Tumble.

55:38.345 --> 55:43.350
And you know what
your wager was.

55:43.642 --> 55:48.395
We played lots of hand and
wagered lots that day.

55:48.397 --> 55:50.900
You wagered your ship,
Captain,

55:51.734 --> 55:56.779
the very one you're transmitting
from as we speak.

55:56.781 --> 56:01.950
No, if I recall correctly, I
wagered a ship,

56:01.952 --> 56:04.953
not necessarily this ship.

56:04.955 --> 56:09.625
Well, you have a ship for me.

56:09.627 --> 56:11.417
I could use it.

56:11.419 --> 56:15.256
My nucleotoid turbo thrusters
are shot

56:15.258 --> 56:19.926
after navigating the
meteor shower

56:19.928 --> 56:20.762
last.

56:22.265 --> 56:26.308
I'm practically the equivalent
of an outer space

56:26.310 --> 56:27.895
row boat out here.

56:28.812 --> 56:33.818
One more comet dust storm and
I'll come apart at the bolts.

56:35.819 --> 56:37.155
That's a jam.

56:38.030 --> 56:41.948
I feel guilty asking
for a favor.

56:41.950 --> 56:44.743
A favor?

56:44.745 --> 56:49.080
Ha, you must be desperate!

56:49.082 --> 56:52.709
Not desperate, just looking
for an edge.

56:52.711 --> 56:56.254
The fate of the universe hangs
in the balance!

56:56.256 --> 56:58.631
Hmm.

56:58.633 --> 57:03.597
You always did like you some
high stakes, Captain Ganymede.

57:05.307 --> 57:08.268
I see some things never change.

57:09.854 --> 57:12.812
Old habits die hard.

57:12.814 --> 57:14.564
So what do you say, old chap?

57:14.566 --> 57:17.360
Help a bloke out
for old time's sake?

57:18.528 --> 57:20.321
Afraid not.

57:20.323 --> 57:24.033
Been burned one too many times

57:24.035 --> 57:26.788
for my liking by you, Ganymede.

57:27.997 --> 57:31.080
I got no help to offer.

57:31.082 --> 57:33.834
Admiral, what would
you say if I told you

57:33.836 --> 57:37.714
there was a great big
spacecraft in it for you?

57:39.466 --> 57:41.802
I'd say where do we start?

57:43.930 --> 57:46.596
Squeak,
are you still alive?

57:46.598 --> 57:48.723
I need you back, my boy.

57:48.725 --> 57:52.895
Squeak, can you hear the sound
of my voice?

57:52.897 --> 57:54.357
Huh, what?

57:55.316 --> 57:56.482
Who's there?

57:56.484 --> 57:57.902
Ham Sanders!

57:59.028 --> 58:03.238
Ham Sandwich?

58:07.120 --> 58:09.870
Whoa, that was trippy!

58:09.872 --> 58:11.747
If you say so, Private.

58:11.749 --> 58:12.705
How did I do?

58:12.707 --> 58:15.625
It was a complete failure.

58:15.627 --> 58:16.752
Oh.

58:16.754 --> 58:18.754
An utter waste of time.

58:18.756 --> 58:21.256
Well, don't mince words,
or anything.

58:21.258 --> 58:24.926
I'm not, and we're still
facing a big fat reindeer

58:24.928 --> 58:27.095
with his hoof on the button.

58:27.097 --> 58:29.391
I told you,
I'm not a reindeer!

58:31.935 --> 58:35.062
Look at him, he's unstable,
on the edge.

58:35.064 --> 58:38.064
The universe could explode at
any moment!

58:38.066 --> 58:41.067
I think I'd rather be
surrounded by tacos.

58:41.069 --> 58:42.569
Dream on, shrimp!

58:42.571 --> 58:46.281
You won't have tacos, or
anything else for that matter.

58:46.283 --> 58:49.075
You'll be reduced to a
speck of dust,

58:49.077 --> 58:53.455
floating in the nothingness that
used to be your world.

58:55.459 --> 58:58.169
Wow, that's some
nihilistic stuff!

58:58.171 --> 59:02.256
Uh-huh, he clearly wasn't
raised right.

59:02.258 --> 59:04.049
Didn't have any friends,
I'd imagine.

59:05.970 --> 59:09.638
All this coming from a misfit
space crossing guard

59:09.640 --> 59:12.892
and a senile outdated hologram!

59:12.894 --> 59:14.310
What a joke!

59:14.312 --> 59:15.770
Are you seeking attention?

59:15.772 --> 59:17.437
Is that what this is about?

59:17.439 --> 59:22.317
Yes, did your reindeer herd
not love you growing up?

59:22.319 --> 59:25.988
For the last time, you
glorified socket wrench,

59:25.990 --> 59:28.406
I am not a reindeer!

59:28.408 --> 59:33.414
I am Tartar III, destroyer of
the universe!

59:35.624 --> 59:38.375
Oh, there's something to be
proud of!

59:38.377 --> 59:41.504
I'll be more than proud,
shrimp.

59:41.506 --> 59:44.339
I'll be legendary.

59:44.341 --> 59:47.634
They'll write books about me,
make movies,

59:47.636 --> 59:50.303
tell spooky bedtime stories.

59:50.305 --> 59:53.140
I'll be a Halloween costume!

59:53.142 --> 59:57.435
Wait, how will any of that
happen if everything is gone?

59:57.437 --> 59:59.437
He's got a point, reindeer.

59:59.439 --> 01:00:02.191
You'll be forgotten, like you
never existed.

01:00:02.193 --> 01:00:04.609
There won't be anyone
to tell your story,

01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:06.694
and no kids to scare at bedtime.

01:00:06.696 --> 01:00:08.948
There won't be anything at all.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.408
You're still not thinking
this through.

01:00:13.453 --> 01:00:15.955
If you want to scare people
with your evil deeds,

01:00:15.957 --> 01:00:18.874
there needs to be some people
around to scare.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:22.044
Fine, Space Guardians,
you want it?

01:00:22.046 --> 01:00:23.546
You've got it.

01:00:23.548 --> 01:00:27.341
There are different settings to
my Cosmic Inflator,

01:00:27.343 --> 01:00:28.843
different options.

01:00:28.845 --> 01:00:31.928
We'll just start smashing
worlds together.

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:33.805
How 'bout them apples?

01:00:33.807 --> 01:00:37.560
A big game of planetary bumper
cars.

01:00:37.562 --> 01:00:38.729
Sound fun?

01:00:40.022 --> 01:00:41.187
Not really.

01:00:41.189 --> 01:00:42.730
Too bad.

01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:44.316
Get a load of this!

01:00:49.115 --> 01:00:49.948
No!

01:00:51.158 --> 01:00:51.992
No!

01:00:53.785 --> 01:00:56.078
Fun, isn't it?

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.040
I hear they just opened a Crazy
Comet Coffee Shop too.

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.794
Lots of spilled lattes!

01:01:03.754 --> 01:01:06.296
Oh, but we won't stop there.

01:01:06.298 --> 01:01:08.591
Hang on, Guardians!

01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:16.473
Crikey, the planets are
smashing up!

01:01:16.475 --> 01:01:18.600
We're out of time!

01:01:18.602 --> 01:01:21.104
Warp speed, Guardians!

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.450
You blasted scoundrel,

01:01:34.452 --> 01:01:37.160
those are worlds
you're destroying!

01:01:37.162 --> 01:01:38.912
I know!

01:01:38.914 --> 01:01:40.165
Isn't it wild?

01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:42.582
Squeak!

01:01:42.584 --> 01:01:43.502
Ham Sanders!

01:01:44.544 --> 01:01:47.296
Guardian headquarters is
operational.

01:01:47.298 --> 01:01:50.633
We're headed your
way with backup!

01:01:50.635 --> 01:01:51.801
Thank heavens!

01:01:51.803 --> 01:01:53.761
Tartar's forcing planets to
collide, Captain!

01:01:53.763 --> 01:01:55.930
There's nothing we
can do to stop him!

01:01:55.932 --> 01:01:58.640
That's where you're wrong,
Squeak.

01:01:58.642 --> 01:02:01.894
You're the only one who
can stop him!

01:02:01.896 --> 01:02:03.312
You must think.

01:02:03.314 --> 01:02:06.439
Oh, great, we're doomed!

01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:09.442
I knew I should have left you
with the Niakas.

01:02:09.444 --> 01:02:12.363
Gee, thanks for the vote of
confidence, Commander.

01:02:12.365 --> 01:02:15.156
The Guardians have faith in
you, Squeak.

01:02:15.158 --> 01:02:17.493
You've saved us once before.

01:02:17.495 --> 01:02:19.620
You can do it again!

01:02:19.622 --> 01:02:21.830
I hope you're right, Captain.

01:02:21.832 --> 01:02:23.915
We'll be there shortly,
agent.

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:26.169
Stay strong and fight
the good fight.

01:02:27.504 --> 01:02:30.839
I don't like being cut off,
Guardians,

01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:34.051
especially while I'm showing off
my new toy.

01:02:34.053 --> 01:02:37.555
Here's what happens when you
don't pay attention.

01:02:41.017 --> 01:02:44.310
Egads, he is
pining for attention,

01:02:44.312 --> 01:02:47.439
like a petulant
overgrown baby reindeer!

01:02:47.441 --> 01:02:50.859
Keep running your metal
mouth, Commander.

01:02:50.861 --> 01:02:54.113
I can smash planets till there
are none left.

01:02:54.115 --> 01:02:58.491
Maybe I'll send a couple your
way, hmm?

01:02:58.493 --> 01:03:02.997
See how your tiny little
spaceship likes that.

01:03:02.999 --> 01:03:05.082
No, please stop, Tartar!

01:03:05.084 --> 01:03:06.542
He'll be quiet.

01:03:06.544 --> 01:03:07.877
Bah!

01:03:07.879 --> 01:03:10.171
Agent
Squeak,

01:03:10.173 --> 01:03:15.091
use your mind's eye
to combat Tartar.

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:17.343
He is contrarian.

01:03:17.345 --> 01:03:22.390
You can confuse him by agreeing
with his plan.

01:03:22.392 --> 01:03:26.145
It will buy valuable time.

01:03:26.147 --> 01:03:27.857
Uh, okay.

01:03:28.732 --> 01:03:32.317
How about Venus
and Uranus next?

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.236
What did you call me?

01:03:34.238 --> 01:03:36.321
Those sound like great picks,
Tartar!

01:03:36.323 --> 01:03:37.781
Smash 'em up!

01:03:37.783 --> 01:03:39.073
What?

01:03:39.075 --> 01:03:40.575
What?

01:03:40.577 --> 01:03:42.328
You've distracted him

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.122
from his intentions,
Agent Squeak.

01:03:45.124 --> 01:03:46.415
Keep it up.

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:48.082
That's a great idea!

01:03:48.084 --> 01:03:50.127
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

01:03:50.129 --> 01:03:52.587
Venus and Uranus got to go!

01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:55.633
Boom, boom, boom!

01:03:55.635 --> 01:03:58.761
My boy, have you
lost your mind?

01:03:58.763 --> 01:04:01.221
What's gotten into you,
shrimp?

01:04:01.223 --> 01:04:02.890
I'm just impressed, Tartar.

01:04:02.892 --> 01:04:05.225
Your planetary
picks are perfect!

01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:07.852
You want to join my fantasy
apocalypse league?

01:04:07.854 --> 01:04:10.941
Hmm, when do you play?

01:04:11.943 --> 01:04:13.441
Every Thursday.

01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:15.611
Won't work,
I raid and pillage

01:04:15.613 --> 01:04:17.946
sub-solar systems on Thursdays

01:04:17.948 --> 01:04:21.283
to prepare for my big attacks on
the weekends.

01:04:21.285 --> 01:04:24.203
Oh, well, I can move it to
Wednesdays.

01:04:24.205 --> 01:04:25.453
You got a mind for this.

01:04:25.455 --> 01:04:27.413
You'd be a real asset.

01:04:27.415 --> 01:04:29.625
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

01:04:29.627 --> 01:04:32.461
Don't try to war game me,
shrimp.

01:04:32.463 --> 01:04:36.756
I'm Tartar III, not some little
gamer geek.

01:04:36.758 --> 01:04:39.551
Now, back to the
business at hand.

01:04:39.553 --> 01:04:42.139
I think I'll spare
Venus and Uranus

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:46.558
for Neptune and Pluto!

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.394
No!

01:04:48.479 --> 01:04:50.979
Now is the
time, Squeak.

01:04:50.981 --> 01:04:54.149
Do not focus on Tartar's words,

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:58.319
but rather, focus on that which
you love.

01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:03.160
See not the stars but what you
want the stars to be.

01:05:04.828 --> 01:05:08.830
Um, I
think I understand.

01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:11.667
Popcorn!

01:05:11.669 --> 01:05:13.794
Popcorn makes everything better.

01:05:13.796 --> 01:05:15.421
Fluffy!

01:05:15.423 --> 01:05:16.546
Buttery!

01:05:16.548 --> 01:05:18.424
Delicious popcorn!

01:05:18.426 --> 01:05:20.176
That's it, Squeak!

01:05:20.178 --> 01:05:22.847
Now, focus harder.

01:05:23.722 --> 01:05:27.223
Think of the object you're
really after.

01:05:27.225 --> 01:05:32.231
Now think of what you really
want that object to be.

01:05:33.899 --> 01:05:35.899
Candy canes!

01:05:35.901 --> 01:05:37.734
The object!

01:05:37.736 --> 01:05:41.363
Locate the object, Squeak.

01:05:41.365 --> 01:05:44.073
I'm trying, I'm trying!

01:05:44.075 --> 01:05:44.910
Lollipops!

01:05:46.328 --> 01:05:48.870
Squeak, focus.

01:05:48.872 --> 01:05:51.372
Locate the object.

01:05:51.374 --> 01:05:54.711
Then transform the object.

01:05:55.879 --> 01:05:58.379
Locate, transform.

01:05:58.381 --> 01:06:00.008
Locate and transform!

01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:05.011
There it is,
the Cosmic Inflator!

01:06:05.013 --> 01:06:08.973
Turn it in
to what you want it to be.

01:06:08.975 --> 01:06:13.939
Will it to transform into that
which you desire most of all.

01:06:17.068 --> 01:06:17.901
Tacos!

01:06:20.071 --> 01:06:22.196
My goodness!

01:06:22.198 --> 01:06:23.404
What?

01:06:23.406 --> 01:06:24.448
No!

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:27.575
Where is my Cosmic Inflator?

01:06:27.577 --> 01:06:29.745
What's happening?

01:06:29.747 --> 01:06:34.415
You've met your match,
Tartar!

01:06:34.417 --> 01:06:38.712
Say hello to the Space
Guardians!

01:06:38.714 --> 01:06:41.131
Ganymede, you're nothing more

01:06:41.133 --> 01:06:43.801
than an intergalactic mall cop!

01:06:43.803 --> 01:06:47.053
How did you fix that hunka junk
ship of yours?

01:06:47.055 --> 01:06:51.433
No matter, I'll finish the job
right now.

01:06:51.435 --> 01:06:55.106
You'll do nothing of the
sort, Tartar.

01:06:56.274 --> 01:07:00.569
Your ship is in my airspace.

01:07:01.736 --> 01:07:04.948
And you're not welcome here.

01:07:08.202 --> 01:07:09.033
What?

01:07:09.035 --> 01:07:10.535
No!

01:07:10.537 --> 01:07:12.620
Yeah, Tartar,
you're finished!

01:07:12.622 --> 01:07:15.124
Kiss your nefarious
plan goodbye!

01:07:15.126 --> 01:07:16.625
Nefarious?

01:07:16.627 --> 01:07:18.461
You don't normally
talk like that.

01:07:18.463 --> 01:07:20.796
I'm impressed, Squeak.

01:07:20.798 --> 01:07:23.006
Where did you learn
a word like nefarious?

01:07:23.008 --> 01:07:25.633
I don't know, I musta heard
it somewhere.

01:07:25.635 --> 01:07:26.843
Did I use it right?

01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:28.136
Oh, yeah!

01:07:28.138 --> 01:07:29.930
It works well.

01:07:29.932 --> 01:07:30.767
Cool!

01:07:31.642 --> 01:07:32.850
Tacos?

01:07:32.852 --> 01:07:35.104
I hate tacos!

01:07:36.314 --> 01:07:38.772
Good, that's more for me.

01:07:38.774 --> 01:07:41.568
Admiral Tumble,
fire when ready!

01:07:43.278 --> 01:07:45.071
So long, Tartar!

01:07:47.033 --> 01:07:49.285
May we never meet again.

01:07:50.327 --> 01:07:51.161
No!

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:20.523
Well, Agent Squeak, you've
done it again.

01:08:20.524 --> 01:08:24.443
That's right, I can hardly
believe it, but it's true!

01:08:24.444 --> 01:08:26.903
You're some kind of hero,
shrimp.

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:29.823
Aw, shucks, I was just doin'
my job.

01:08:29.825 --> 01:08:32.701
It's what being a Space
Guardian's all about.

01:08:32.703 --> 01:08:36.287
Hey, speaking of Space
Guardians,

01:08:36.288 --> 01:08:40.792
why don't you give a warm
welcome to our newest member,

01:08:40.794 --> 01:08:42.296
Admiral Tumble!

01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:47.006
Howdy, Space Guardians.

01:08:47.008 --> 01:08:51.971
It's good to be here, aboard a
real spacecraft.

01:08:53.098 --> 01:08:56.769
Thanks for allowing me to retire
mine, finally.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.068
Oh, and Captain, consider that
debt paid in full.

01:09:05.861 --> 01:09:09.196
Welcome, Admiral, and thanks
for all your help out there.

01:09:09.198 --> 01:09:10.990
We couldn't have done
it without you.

01:09:10.992 --> 01:09:15.120
You're being modest,
young, uh,

01:09:17.497 --> 01:09:18.332
man.

01:09:19.374 --> 01:09:21.250
Uh, shrimp.

01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:23.587
Ah, yes, shrimp!

01:09:24.546 --> 01:09:29.591
At any rate, you seemed to be
handling things just fine

01:09:29.593 --> 01:09:31.301
before I came along.

01:09:31.303 --> 01:09:36.309
I can only hope to be half the
Space Guardian that you are.

01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:40.770
You set the bar high,
Agent Squeak.

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:44.732
Well, thanks, Admiral, but I
didn't do it alone.

01:09:44.734 --> 01:09:47.108
Hold on, Admiral!

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:50.528
We got us another
call coming in.

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:54.241
Confound it, where in
tarnation is that mission room?

01:09:54.243 --> 01:09:56.952
I can't find anything in this
big spaceship.

01:09:56.954 --> 01:09:58.286
Use your portable nightlight

01:09:58.288 --> 01:10:00.288
and follow the arrows,
Commander.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.126
Madness, how do you people
find your way around this ship?

01:10:04.128 --> 01:10:07.921
I've played virtual reality
games that are easier than this!

01:10:07.923 --> 01:10:12.300
We spend a right lot of time
out here, Commander.

01:10:12.302 --> 01:10:14.469
Practice makes perfect.

01:10:14.471 --> 01:10:17.139
Well, I give up!

01:10:17.141 --> 01:10:19.892
After wandering around trying to
find you all,

01:10:19.894 --> 01:10:22.310
my head is spinning like a top!

01:10:22.312 --> 01:10:25.313
Oh, I have a trick for that.

01:10:25.315 --> 01:10:27.649
Focus on one object.

01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:29.484
It'll keep you balanced.

01:10:29.486 --> 01:10:31.069
Huh?

01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:34.907
What are you supposed to be, one
of those moon marsupials?

01:10:34.909 --> 01:10:37.033
He's a space Swirlagug,
Commander.

01:10:37.035 --> 01:10:38.995
A ranked Swirlagug.

01:10:39.955 --> 01:10:41.871
Colonel Rough at your service.

01:10:41.873 --> 01:10:45.334
Rough's a colleague,
Commander.

01:10:45.336 --> 01:10:47.129
You'll get to know him well.

01:10:48.172 --> 01:10:53.008
That is, if you'll accept a room
and join us.

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:54.175
Join you?

01:10:54.177 --> 01:10:56.344
The Space Guardians?

01:10:56.346 --> 01:10:58.304
You can't be serious.

01:10:58.306 --> 01:11:00.014
But we are, Commander Ham
Sanders!

01:11:00.016 --> 01:11:03.893
The Space Guardians always
have room

01:11:03.895 --> 01:11:07.814
for a leader of your expertise,
Commander.

01:11:07.816 --> 01:11:12.736
We'd like you to think it over
while you're resting.

01:11:12.738 --> 01:11:15.447
Uh, how long are
your work days?

01:11:15.449 --> 01:11:17.366
Work days, what work days?

01:11:17.368 --> 01:11:19.702
Space Guardians are
never off duty.

01:11:19.704 --> 01:11:21.786
Ha, you see what I mean?

01:11:21.788 --> 01:11:23.496
No, thank you!

01:11:23.498 --> 01:11:26.375
I'm an old robot,
I need my sleep.

01:11:26.377 --> 01:11:29.670
And besides, I'm not really
here, remember?

01:11:29.672 --> 01:11:31.171
'Sup, Guardians?

01:11:31.173 --> 01:11:32.465
Marlenia!

01:11:32.467 --> 01:11:35.050
My favorite space rebel.

01:11:35.052 --> 01:11:37.719
So good to see you!

01:11:37.721 --> 01:11:39.554
Ship running smooth, Captain?

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.389
You know it is!

01:11:41.391 --> 01:11:45.560
Our eternal gratitude for your
help, miss.

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:47.479
Well, eternity's a long time.

01:11:47.481 --> 01:11:49.398
I only need, like,
a couple of hours.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.149
Mind if I borrow an agent?

01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:52.693
Which one?

01:11:52.695 --> 01:11:54.319
The cute one over there.

01:11:54.321 --> 01:11:56.112
Squeak, you owe me another
dinner date,

01:11:56.114 --> 01:11:58.616
and I already made our
reservations.

01:11:58.618 --> 01:12:01.160
We're kind of in the middle
of a meeting, Marlenia.

01:12:01.162 --> 01:12:03.496
About what, slapping each
other's backs?

01:12:03.498 --> 01:12:06.247
The bad guy's vanquished, your
ship's back in action,

01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:07.582
and you've got new members.

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.417
What's left to talk about?

01:12:09.419 --> 01:12:12.295
Um...

01:12:12.297 --> 01:12:14.758
Agent Squeak, get outta here.

01:12:15.842 --> 01:12:17.343
Yes, Captain, right away!

01:12:17.345 --> 01:12:18.510
Just call me if you need me.

01:12:18.512 --> 01:12:19.680
I'll be at, uh...

01:12:21.056 --> 01:12:22.932
Mastrano's, of course!

01:12:22.934 --> 01:12:24.892
Mastrano's, my favorite!

01:12:24.894 --> 01:12:27.644
They just opened a location on
Planet Niak.

01:12:27.646 --> 01:12:29.313
Why don't we all go?

01:12:29.315 --> 01:12:30.688
I have credit there.

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.649
We'll eat for free!

01:12:32.651 --> 01:12:35.318
No!

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:44.370
