Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:02.802 --> 00:04.895
- Is this the 15th Detective Squad?
- Yes.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.132
Hi, I'm Geri Turner.
I'm your new P.A.A.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.267
Henry Coffield. She left you
that building. Teresa Coffield.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.971
- Yeah, sit down.
- I don't want to sit down.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.241
That's my mother.
That building's supposed to be mine.

00:15.315 --> 00:18.978
- I know nothin' about this.
- Try to do the right thing...

00:19.052 --> 00:21.316
'cause otherwise
you're gonna ruin someone's life.

00:21.388 --> 00:24.653
This has become a nightmare, Andy-
these continual postponements.

00:24.724 --> 00:28.251
I'm not startin' a diet today.
You wanna start it, you start it yourself.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.728
Andy, we both require
peer reinforcement.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.731
- We've discussed this.
- Shut up, Medavoy.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.997
Diane, I-
I want you to marry me.

00:37.337 --> 00:39.271
[ Exhales ]
Oh. Bobby.

00:40.473 --> 00:43.442
- I- I don't know what to say.
- No?

01:10.036 --> 01:13.164
- 196 and a half.
- [ Sighs ]

01:20.680 --> 01:22.841
221.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.851
- I'm three inches taller, minimum.
- [Pounding]

01:25.919 --> 01:28.752
[Man ]
Come on, what's going on? I gotta piss.

01:28.822 --> 01:32.781
- Who's that? Morrissey?
- Yeah, can't get a break on his case.

01:36.429 --> 01:40.092
- What the hell are you doin' in here?
- Weighin' ourselves.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.294
- We're starting a competitive diet.
- Yeah, real interesting.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.701
Anybody ask
if you were interested?

01:45.772 --> 01:49.640
Yeah, that's a point.
Hate to butt in with real police work.

01:49.709 --> 01:53.008
Hey, let me loan you some of my kids'
Mister Rogers tapes, Morrissey.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.513
Give you a different approach
to your begin-the-day attitude.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.516
Ah, save it.

01:59.152 --> 02:03.418
He's got no weight problem,
so-so he don't think it's important.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.856
You're 196 and a half.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.586
- I'm 221.
- Next weigh-in's Friday.

02:08.661 --> 02:12.654
[ Sighs ] Any impulse
to dine together, Andy?

02:12.732 --> 02:14.996
- Buttress our commitments?
- No.

02:15.068 --> 02:19.164
- See, this way we're reminded.
It's a friendly competition.
- No.

02:19.239 --> 02:23.232
Okay, then.
Then everybody's on his own.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.370
And I'll tell you something, Andy.
I did not relieve myself before the weigh-in.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.746
So I got that advantage.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.081
Number one or two.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.959
- Hey, Andy.
- How's it going, Martinez?

03:55.034 --> 03:58.003
Andy, I, uh, know you and
Vince Gotelli go back a ways...

03:58.071 --> 04:00.665
but I'm hoping you'll give me
a serious look when you cast your ballot...

04:00.740 --> 04:02.674
for delegate tomorrow.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.081
"Honest, hardworking
and interested."

04:09.148 --> 04:12.174
- That's my campaign slogan.
- I already got a mug.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.743
This can be a backup in case
something happens to that one.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.812
Seven years-
this cup's still in one piece.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.551
In other words,
you're going for Gotelli?

04:19.625 --> 04:23.221
It's a secret ballot, Martinez.
That's what all them wars were for.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.287
- Hey, Stu, you want a campaign mug?
- Yeah, thanks.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.697
- Uh, Andy, you got a second?
- Yeah.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.792
- Good morning.
- Detective, your messages.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.837
Talk to you and Bobby
for a minute?

04:31.904 --> 04:33.929
No law says
you couldn't have two mugs.

04:36.743 --> 04:40.406
- What's up?
- Sorry I broke bad before.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.880
- I'm over it.
- Anything on that missing kid?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.974
Nah. I'm goin' at
the father again.

04:45.051 --> 04:48.885
I'm on no sleep, guys
from Missing Persons are empty suits.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.856
I gotta look at the father. He was
supposed to be taking care of the kid...

04:51.924 --> 04:54.859
but God's honest truth,
I don't know if I should like him or not.

04:56.262 --> 05:00.096
Well, could we sit in?
Take a listen to the guy?

05:00.166 --> 05:03.033
I'll tell you,
I'd really appreciate that.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.195
How bad you gonna piss off
these guys from Missing Persons?

05:05.271 --> 05:07.865
- Hey, I give a rat's ass, all the help they've been.
- Where you got him?

05:07.940 --> 05:10.738
Two.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.105
- Could we get a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

05:17.183 --> 05:20.050
Thanks. I want Mr. Garza to talk
to a couple guys from my squad.

05:20.119 --> 05:23.522
[ Clears Throat ] Ricardo, this is, uh,
Detective Simone and Sipowicz.

05:23.522 --> 05:24.454
[ Clears Throat ] Ricardo, this is, uh,
Detective Simone and Sipowicz.

05:24.523 --> 05:27.720
- Good to meet you.
- [Sipowicz] Sorry about the situation.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.659
Yeah, well,
what would be better is...

05:30.729 --> 05:33.220
if more police kept looking
for my baby girl, you know...

05:33.298 --> 05:36.131
- instead of askin' me what happened 10 times.
- We got other detectives...

05:36.201 --> 05:38.601
re-canvassing the whole area, Ricardo-
that's continuous.

05:38.670 --> 05:41.138
Yeah, they got guys out
from all over the borough.

05:41.206 --> 05:44.175
Someone saw your girl get taken,
we're gonna find 'em.

05:44.242 --> 05:47.268
Can I get you to tell us
what happened again?

05:47.345 --> 05:50.576
- As hard as that is for you.
- I'm hoping they'll have
different questions for you...

05:50.649 --> 05:52.776
bring out other details
that could be helpful.

05:52.851 --> 05:54.978
We're all looking to find
your baby here, Mr. Garza...

05:55.053 --> 05:58.784
- everybody in this room, okay?
- [ Sighs ]

05:58.857 --> 06:04.591
Okay, 8:00 last night,
I go out to get some dinner, right?

06:04.663 --> 06:06.858
I take her in her stroller
so she's not home alone, you know?

06:06.932 --> 06:11.198
- Your wife’s at work?
- She works three nights a week
with a cleaning service.

06:11.269 --> 06:13.703
While I'm waiting for my order,
I call my mother...

06:13.772 --> 06:17.868
'cause the phone at my place is temporarily
disconnected, I use the pizzeria phone.

06:17.943 --> 06:20.844
- Which is inside?
- Yeah, it's in the corner where the seats are.

06:20.912 --> 06:23.437
Phone booth
with a hinged door.

06:23.515 --> 06:26.040
I get off the phone.
Crystal's not in her stroller.

06:26.117 --> 06:28.642
She's gone.
I start going off. Where is she?

06:28.720 --> 06:31.280
How far from the stroller were
you when you were in the booth?

06:31.356 --> 06:33.620
I was 1 5 feet away,
no further than that.

06:33.692 --> 06:37.184
But my back's halfway turned, you know, I'm
trying to listen to what my mother's saying.

06:37.262 --> 06:39.230
That's how
they must’ve grabbed her up.

06:39.297 --> 06:41.822
Grabbed her like snatched her up,
as opposed to someone you knew?

06:41.900 --> 06:44.027
I guess, yeah.

06:44.102 --> 06:47.799
Well, I-I mean, if it was a stranger
you would've think she would've cried, right?

06:47.872 --> 06:50.807
I asked Ricardo that- anyone from
the neighborhood that might have done it.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.571
Stu, let him tell it.

06:53.645 --> 06:55.977
I already told them.
I couldn't think of anybody, all right?

06:56.047 --> 06:58.948
I-I don't know how this happened.
I don't know who took her.

06:59.017 --> 07:01.178
If I knew,
I would have said. Believe me.

07:01.252 --> 07:04.187
People saw the stroller,
but nobody saw the baby inside.

07:08.994 --> 07:11.053
So what are you saying, huh?

07:12.964 --> 07:16.593
- Say what you're trying to say.
- Easy, Mr. Garza. Come on.

07:17.969 --> 07:20.904
Look, the baby
was in the stroller...

07:20.972 --> 07:23.202
my back was halfway
turned talking to my mother...

07:23.274 --> 07:25.265
and somebody picked her up.

07:25.343 --> 07:28.107
And if I find out who in hell
stole my daughter before you guys do...

07:28.179 --> 07:30.511
then you're gonna have me
in here for murder!

07:30.582 --> 07:33.176
And I'll cop to it!

07:45.096 --> 07:47.656
- What do you think?
- You got to look hard at him.

07:47.732 --> 07:51.224
- What's the wife say?
- Backs him up strong-
good father, good provider.

07:51.302 --> 07:53.736
Gets his load on payday,
but he don't get mean.

07:54.839 --> 07:58.639
- Thank you, Mr. Garza.
- Okay, thanks.

08:01.980 --> 08:06.076
- She said he don't get mean,
or you brought it out?
- No, I brought it out.

08:06.151 --> 08:08.278
She volunteers,
you'd wonder if she’s coverin'.

08:08.353 --> 08:10.514
- Nothin' about he's abusive?
- Nothin' at all.

08:10.588 --> 08:12.886
I went for it
four different ways.

08:12.957 --> 08:15.755
- Where'd he get muscled-up like that?
- Never been in the joint, Andy.

08:15.827 --> 08:19.422
Lifts weights at home.
You wanna talk to the wife?

08:19.497 --> 08:22.625
No, Stu. Nobody's tryin'
to elbow in on your case.

08:22.701 --> 08:26.501
I came to you. I don't want
Fancy bringin' seven squads in.

08:26.571 --> 08:29.563
- I'll get the wife down here.
- When did you sleep last, Stu?

08:29.641 --> 08:32.235
Yeah, I should.

08:32.309 --> 08:34.904
I'll get her in.

08:34.979 --> 08:38.914
- Out on his feet. [ Scoffs ]
- Maybe over his head.

08:41.251 --> 08:43.583
I gotta go talk to that
half-wacko from the building.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.589
Your real estate
inheritance?

08:45.657 --> 08:48.626
- How'd it go with the lawyer?
- [ Sighs ] He don't think it's got much equity.

08:48.693 --> 08:51.753
She refinanced the note
when all the real estate was high.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.355
You're not gonna get
stuck on this?

08:54.432 --> 08:57.128
Wi-Will the rentals
finance the note?

08:57.202 --> 09:01.161
Past the taxes and the note,
the lawyer figures, like, 500 a month income.

09:01.239 --> 09:06.643
Well, that's not bad. As long as there's
no big maintenance problems.

09:06.711 --> 09:08.645
Hey.

09:11.382 --> 09:14.044
- No. Now, don't start.
- [ Laughs ]

09:14.119 --> 09:16.349
She adjusted my collar.
She reached right in there.

09:16.421 --> 09:19.515
She messed around with my tie
with no permission whatsoever.

09:19.591 --> 09:22.185
- [ Sniffs ]
- I got to get out of here.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.524
Lawyer say what
this kid's problem was?

09:24.596 --> 09:27.895
- Why she didn't leave the house to him?
- Yeah, she left me a letter.

09:27.966 --> 09:30.901
- It says the kid's got no willpower.
- Which shows itself how?

09:30.969 --> 09:32.994
Could he damage
the physical plan?

09:33.071 --> 09:35.904
Yeah, the letter
didn't go into it.

09:35.974 --> 09:39.740
Don't hold off on the interview
if Morrissey brings in the mother.

09:39.811 --> 09:44.748
Bobby, was the baby
in that stroller?

09:44.816 --> 09:47.478
How come no one saw it?

09:52.624 --> 09:54.717
Hey. Oh, Greg.
I got the mugs.

09:54.793 --> 09:57.261
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Check it out.

09:57.328 --> 09:59.262
- Hey.
- Ah, you got the mugs.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.264
- Yeah.
- Nice!

10:01.332 --> 10:03.994
That's right. What this says is,
I'm serious. I'm going that extra step.

10:04.068 --> 10:07.526
- Like I'll go the extra step as your delegate.
- Yeah, good approach.

10:07.605 --> 10:09.766
- Yeah.
- I'm thinkin' of havin' a pastry fragment.

10:09.841 --> 10:12.173
You know, if-if-if-
if you starve yourself...

10:12.243 --> 10:14.370
you may overcompensate
and wind up on a binge.

10:14.445 --> 10:16.504
Figure it'd put
a little on your stomach, huh?

10:16.581 --> 10:20.483
- Yeah.
- Well, anyways, uh...

10:20.552 --> 10:24.283
- this one's for you, all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Good, James.

10:24.355 --> 10:26.289
- Yeah.
- You got my vote.

10:26.357 --> 10:28.689
- All right.
- [ Sighs ]

10:28.760 --> 10:31.092
No, sir.

10:43.975 --> 10:46.569
- How's it going?
- Hi.

10:46.644 --> 10:50.341
Oh, I'm Bobby Simone.
Mrs. Cimino left me the building.

10:50.415 --> 10:52.576
Sara Carelli, 2-D.
This is Buster.

10:52.650 --> 10:54.379
Hey, Buster.

10:54.452 --> 10:57.216
Mrs. Cimino was always
really nice about pets.

10:57.288 --> 11:00.382
- Yeah, huh?
- Were you related in some way?

11:00.458 --> 11:02.551
My wife was Mrs. Cimino's niece.

11:02.627 --> 11:05.824
Oh, she was sweet.
She taught me to needlepoint.

11:05.897 --> 11:09.060
Do you know?
uh, Henry, her son?

11:09.133 --> 11:12.398
- Uh-huh.
- Would you mind if I ask you
whatyou thought about him?

11:12.470 --> 11:14.734
I'd just as soon not
get in the middle of that.

11:14.806 --> 11:18.173
If he would've taken the building,
you think he would’ve let you keep the dog?

11:18.243 --> 11:21.508
Mrs. Ciminowas always
really sweet about pets.

11:21.579 --> 11:26.482
I used to help her here on weekends, Sara.
She didn't allow any pets.

11:26.551 --> 11:29.645
- I got mugged three weeks ago.
- I don't have any problem with the dog.

11:29.721 --> 11:33.350
I don't like Henry much.
Let me give you an example.

11:33.424 --> 11:36.086
After I got mugged,
I rang his buzzer, 'cause I didn't have keys.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.924
I'm callin' the cops,
he's sittin' yelling at the ballplayers on TV.

11:38.997 --> 11:41.488
- They, uh, catch the guy?
- No.

11:41.566 --> 11:45.127
There's somebody I used to work with
in this precinct. I can give him a call.

11:45.203 --> 11:48.434
- You on the job?
- Yeah, I'm a detective over in Manhattan.

11:48.506 --> 11:51.839
It'd be great to have a cop
involved with the building.

11:51.910 --> 11:54.003
Yeah, well,
it looks like I'm involved.

11:54.078 --> 11:57.946
- Henry stood you up?
- Anyways, good to meet you, Sara.

11:58.016 --> 12:01.213
Good to meetyou.
Say thanks, Buster.

12:01.286 --> 12:03.720
Yeah, you got a talking dog
there, huh?

12:03.788 --> 12:05.722
[ Chuckles ]

12:16.467 --> 12:18.401
- Detective Simone.
- Hello.

12:18.469 --> 12:21.461
- I'm hoping you'll have your
daughter back real soon.
- Thank you.

12:21.539 --> 12:25.031
Uh, Mrs. Garza, just got here.
She met Andy-

12:25.109 --> 12:27.543
Detective Sipowicz.

12:27.612 --> 12:32.345
- D o-Do you have news about Crystal?
- [Sipowicz Clears Throat]

12:32.417 --> 12:36.376
I know this is hard on you,
but we'd like to ask more questions.

12:36.454 --> 12:38.718
I don't know where to look for her.
I don't know who took her.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.588
This is to give us more
background, Mrs. Garza.

12:41.659 --> 12:44.287
Maybe think of
more avenues to pursue.

12:44.362 --> 12:47.525
- You work three nights a week?
- Uh-huh, cleaning office buildings.

12:47.598 --> 12:50.431
And your husband takes care
of your daughter at those times?

12:50.501 --> 12:54.096

didn't take the baby.

- Nobody said he did, ma'am.
- Then what are these questions about?

- Th-These questions might...

might not suspect.

that might want to take Crystal...

of anyone like that.

- Does he ever hit you?

No, he doesn't hit me.
And, no, he doesn't take drugs.

24:26.895 --> 24:30.228
So, come on. Come on.

24:36.171 --> 24:38.901
- You think I messed up?
- I think you wasted a good beating, Vince.

24:38.974 --> 24:40.999
Oh, damn it!

24:41.076 --> 24:44.307
That's the witness,
Mrs. Valentin.

24:44.379 --> 24:47.348
- You bring her in?
- No, she's in on her own.

24:47.415 --> 24:49.975
She wants to know
if we, uh, picked this Nene up.

24:50.051 --> 24:53.111
You know, she could be a
straight-out nut job too.

24:53.188 --> 24:55.383
Don't have to be hooked up
with Garza, you mean?

24:55.457 --> 24:59.393
I beat the balls off of this guy.
Does it sound like he's gonna sue?

24:59.461 --> 25:03.227
- Geri, uh, you heard from the lieutenant?
- He's got root canal.

25:03.298 --> 25:05.232
- Right.
- He's not gonna tell Fancy, is he?

25:05.300 --> 25:07.200
Shut up, Vince.

25:07.269 --> 25:09.203
Let's, uh, see what
this woman's about.

25:10.205 --> 25:12.264
Hi, I'm Detective Simone.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.741
- I'm a day shift detective
working with D et. Gotelli.
- This is Detective Sipowicz.

25:15.811 --> 25:17.472
- How's it goin'?
- Hello.

25:17.546 --> 25:20.538
We understand you have some information
regarding the Garza kidnapping.

25:20.615 --> 25:23.413
- I saw Nene Lopez take that baby.
- Take the baby from where?

25:23.485 --> 25:26.886
The pizza place.
I was standing right outside.

25:26.955 --> 25:29.253
D id he confess?
Uh, he said you brought him in.

25:29.324 --> 25:32.623
You say it was Nene Lopez. I guess you
must have known him by name already.

25:32.694 --> 25:35.219
No, he's known
all over the neighborhood.

25:35.297 --> 25:37.527
D oyou want me
to pick him out of a lineup?

25:37.599 --> 25:39.624
I mean,
I'm willing to do that.

25:39.701 --> 25:43.694
I'll tell you, Mrs. Valentin, we're not
really sure this is really Nene Lopez.

25:43.772 --> 25:46.605
I'm wonderin' if you could take a look
at him in our interview room?

25:46.675 --> 25:49.701
Not picking him out if he did or didn't
take the Garza child-

25:49.778 --> 25:53.612
-Just for checking his identity,
so there's no confusion.
- Okay.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.877
I wantyou
to have the right person.

25:57.052 --> 25:58.986
Right this way, ma'am.

26:08.196 --> 26:10.221
You beat him.

26:10.298 --> 26:12.289
Good.

26:13.368 --> 26:17.065
Did they beat you, uh?
You bastard!

26:17.138 --> 26:21.097
- Good. I hope you burn in hell!
- You got strong feelings on him, huh?

26:21.176 --> 26:23.736
That's the animal
got my sister hooked on drugs.

26:23.812 --> 26:26.110
I hope theybeatyousome more!
How could you do this?

26:26.181 --> 26:29.344
- She was an angel!
- No, no. No-

26:30.418 --> 26:32.409
Nene didn't kidnap
that kid, did he?

26:32.487 --> 26:35.650
Mysisteris an angel.

26:35.724 --> 26:40.320
But on this missing baby here,
Mrs. Valentin...

26:40.395 --> 26:42.488
Nene's not involved?

26:43.665 --> 26:45.599
No.

26:46.668 --> 26:49.296
Come on,
I'll get you a ride home.

26:53.909 --> 26:57.811
Maybe you should drive her, Vince.

27:01.549 --> 27:04.814

with this guy now?

Stay here.

27:18.433 --> 27:23.370
Oh, man, who leaves the furnace on
in October in here, huh?

27:23.438 --> 27:28.273
What the hell is going on here?
It's hotter than hell inside here!

27:28.343 --> 27:32.336
- Who was screaming before?
- Don't you worry about
who was screaming before, Nene.

27:32.414 --> 27:35.975
You got plenty else
to worry about.

27:36.051 --> 27:39.043
This is wrong, man. I've done
some foul things, but not this thing.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.111
Shut up.

27:41.189 --> 27:43.384

27:46.828 --> 27:49.296

You sit down here, huh?

27:49.364 --> 27:54.165
I'm gonna see, can you stand up
to all your big talk before, Nene, huh?

27:54.235 --> 27:57.136
See, that detective that
tuned you up during the night...

27:57.205 --> 28:00.333
- he was out of practice.
- Why don't you think about that baby, man?

28:00.408 --> 28:03.434
The time you're wasting on me,
the kidnapper's out doing his thing.

28:03.511 --> 28:06.036

I'm gonna beat your balls off.

29:06.074 --> 29:08.008
What's the matter with you,
Gotelli?

29:08.076 --> 29:10.943
- You interview a suspect on
my case, and you don't call me?
- Take it easy, Stu.

29:11.012 --> 29:13.412
- I gotta hear from the desk sergeant?
- It's all taken care of.

29:13.481 --> 29:17.042
- The hell it is! You guys knew about this?
- We walked into it, Morrissey.

29:17.118 --> 29:20.281
And when are you gonna have enough steam
to ask is the guy right for the kidnap?

29:20.355 --> 29:23.688
- Is he?
- No, smack dealer, Stu.

29:23.758 --> 29:26.955
- The woman wanted to hurt him
for hookin' her sister.
- We took care of it.

29:30.532 --> 29:32.864
- We gotta talk to the mother again.
- [Sipowicz] On what?

29:32.934 --> 29:37.030
Child Welfare found another kid under
her maiden name living with a grandmother.

29:37.105 --> 29:39.266
- With the grandmother?
- Gonna find out what that's about.

29:39.340 --> 29:43.470
I gotta go home, fellas.
Stu, I 'm sorry it went down this way.

29:43.545 --> 29:46.605
- Just don't ever try to pull
a case out from under me.
- I understand.

29:46.681 --> 29:50.378
- This affects your ballot,
I'll understand that also.
- Yeah, right.

29:50.452 --> 29:54.548
- D id you happen to, uh, vote yet, or-
- I voted already... for Martinez.

29:54.622 --> 29:58.023
- No hard feelings.
- Get some rest, Vince.

29:58.093 --> 30:01.290
That's how I got into this jackpot,
trying to spare Stu.

30:01.362 --> 30:04.229
I mean, everybody
said he was exhausted.

30:07.969 --> 30:11.336
Why do you think
she don't admit to the other kid?

30:11.406 --> 30:14.608
- It's welfare thing- I-I- I don't know.
- Hey, Lieu.

30:15.642 --> 30:18.076
You had a root canal, huh?

30:18.144 --> 30:20.203
I, uh...

30:20.280 --> 30:23.044
took a call downstairs at the switchboard
from Brooklyn Homicide.

30:23.116 --> 30:26.643
They got a motorist who saw a pedestrian
on the Brooklyn Bridge...

30:26.720 --> 30:29.416
dump a black satchel in the river,
Monday night around 7:00.

30:29.489 --> 30:32.481
Motorist says he saw Ricardo Garza's
picture in the paperyesterday.

30:32.559 --> 30:34.220
He thinks Garza's
who dumped the satchel.

30:34.294 --> 30:37.092
- Let's bring the driver in to have a look at him.
- You get Garza.

30:37.163 --> 30:40.223
Brooklyn's bringing the motorist
to the bridge, so he can point out the spot.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.700
- Scuba team's been notified?
- Yeah, stay with the divers...

30:42.769 --> 30:44.669
till you see
what they come up with.

30:44.738 --> 30:47.036
- Then bring the motorist over here.
- [Simone ] Yeah, okay.

30:47.107 --> 30:51.043
-So we're looking at a dead kid.
-Just get Garza, all right, Stu?

- But he can't be as good a guy.

with the baby's father?

- How are you gonna go at 'em?

- He's seen dumping the body.
We know he's involved.
- So, go at her first?

- What?
- I reallywouldn't, Stu.

If she’s innocent, you want to move her
from protecting her husband...

to hold to.

- We can all come at her
from different directions.

because it's nothing to do with Crystal.

Johnny is not his natural son.
Crystal is his.

- How did your daughter die?

and crying, and I ask her...

and one time,
to be quiet-

I raised a hand,
and that's all that happened, all right?

she hit her head or what accident-

38:49.388 --> 38:51.754
It was accidental.

about the pizzeria?

to spare mywife...

always look at me with hate.

39:10.443 --> 39:12.377
Now she's gonna hate me.

39:22.255 --> 39:24.746
He gave it up.

39:24.824 --> 39:28.385
He wants a cup of coffee,
then he'll give a statement.

39:28.461 --> 39:30.554
- Mother still in there?
- Bobby's sitting with her.

39:30.630 --> 39:33.565
This asshole
wants to talk to her.

39:33.633 --> 39:36.227
- Not till he gives his statement.
- And she gets a no.

39:39.639 --> 39:42.073
I tell her he gave it up, right?

39:42.141 --> 39:44.473
Tell her now?

39:54.854 --> 39:57.254
Son of a bitch.

40:01.561 --> 40:05.429
He wasn't getting
enough attention.

40:06.766 --> 40:09.826
- [Elise Screaming]
- [ Sipowicz Groans ]

40:09.902 --> 40:12.803
- Give Stu a chance, Andy.
- [ Weeping ]

40:15.508 --> 40:17.669
[ MorrisseyWhispering,
Indistinct ]

40:23.382 --> 40:26.613
- [Weeping Continues ]
- He's doing okay.

40:50.409 --> 40:52.400
[ Yawns ]

40:56.382 --> 40:59.215
- All done?
- Mm-hmm.

41:12.465 --> 41:14.490
[ Snaps Fingers, Claps Hands ]

41:14.567 --> 41:16.558
I could go foryou
just for your cooking.

41:19.005 --> 41:21.473
The rest
is just a bonus, huh?

41:21.540 --> 41:24.998
Uh-huh.

41:25.077 --> 41:28.274
That's why I'm ready to
keep walking on eggshells...

41:28.347 --> 41:30.338
till you decide to treat me
like a human again.

41:30.416 --> 41:32.680
Whoa, Diane.
You don't want to get married.

41:32.752 --> 41:34.879
You don't think that's
supposed to make a difference?

41:34.954 --> 41:37.855
The difference would be if we did get married.
I wanna be like we were.

41:37.923 --> 41:40.084
Well, you may like pretending,
I'm not with that.

41:40.159 --> 41:42.184
I'm sorry if that’s what
you think I've been doing.

41:42.261 --> 41:45.196
That's what I think you’ve been doing.
You had a lot of practice.

41:45.264 --> 41:48.995
- You talking about myfamily?
- You're the one that's
always putting 'em between us.

41:49.068 --> 41:51.696
- 'Cause that's a lousy thing to say.
- [Beeping]

41:56.475 --> 41:59.376
Come on, Diane.
The last thing that I want...

41:59.445 --> 42:02.039
- is for us to be going off
on each other, all right?
- [ Chuckles ]

42:02.114 --> 42:04.708
Shows you what a dope I am. I thought tonight
might be about us getting back together.

42:04.784 --> 42:07.844
Well, I think what we need to do
is work on how we're gonna be.

42:10.589 --> 42:13.023
Maybe we should just back off.

42:13.092 --> 42:15.287
More than we already have?

42:18.731 --> 42:21.359
[ Laughs ]
So who's leaving the country?

42:24.670 --> 42:27.639
- [ Beeper Clattering ]
- What do you got?

42:32.044 --> 42:34.137
Brooklyn Homicide.

42:53.299 --> 42:56.700
- [ Simone ] Savino?
- Hey.

42:56.769 --> 42:59.567
- Your building, huh?
- Yeah. How'd this happen?

42:59.638 --> 43:02.334
Looks like an execution.
Nothing's taken.

43:02.408 --> 43:05.571
- She got shot through
the peephole in her door.
- What?

43:05.644 --> 43:08.943
- [Dog Whimpering]
- Hey, Buster.

43:09.014 --> 43:12.313
Hey.
It's all right.

43:14.887 --> 43:17.583
- Where-Where are you with him?
- He found her.

43:17.656 --> 43:20.955
Just another one
ofyour tenants, right?

43:21.026 --> 43:23.392
- Can I talk to him for a second?
- Sure.

43:30.136 --> 43:32.764
- What went on here, Henry?
- What do you mean, what went on here?

43:32.838 --> 43:34.999
- She got murdered.
- And who did it?

43:35.074 --> 43:37.099
What'reyou asking me for?

43:39.412 --> 43:43.473
I'm asking you, 'cause
you're in it to your hips, you little twit.

43:43.549 --> 43:45.744
Everything all right?

43:47.186 --> 43:50.019
Yeah.
Got a little coincidence here.

43:50.089 --> 43:52.387
Yesterday, this one tells me somebody's
gonna shoot him through the door.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.892
I got nothing to do with this!
My God, I found her.

43:54.960 --> 43:57.053
- I called it in.
- Shut up!

43:57.129 --> 43:59.563
Um, let me ask you something.

43:59.632 --> 44:02.795
[Police Radio Chatter]

44:05.004 --> 44:07.529
- You wanna cool your jets a little?
- He's in the middle of this.

44:07.606 --> 44:10.575
You know, Ipreferit ifyou'dhave
told me the door stuffin private...

44:10.643 --> 44:13.840
and anything else you might know,
and then I go at him how I see fit.

44:15.381 --> 44:19.181
I was out on the street yesterday
talking with this girl, man.

44:19.251 --> 44:22.743
And today,
I got a murder to solve, okay?

44:22.822 --> 44:24.756
Yeah. Okay.

44:32.064 --> 44:34.032
[ Sighs ]

44:34.099 --> 44:37.000
Hey, I'll take care
ofthat dog ifyou want.

44:37.069 --> 44:39.503
- She let me walk that dog.
- You are gonna be busy, Henry!

44:42.074 --> 44:44.440
Yeah, Mr. Coffield.
I've got some questions for you.
