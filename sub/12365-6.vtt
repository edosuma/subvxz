WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:08.957
[insects chirping]

00:21.856 --> 00:24.768
[Seth] It doesn't cry out
when it's shot?

00:25.568 --> 00:27.149
[Mitch]
No, man.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.612
Shut up.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.861
[rustling]

00:31.073 --> 00:32.779
-Mitch! Dude.
-Shh.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.903
-You got to chill.
-Yeah.

00:35.119 --> 00:37.405
Stay here.
I'm gonna go down by the creek.

00:37.622 --> 00:39.988
There might be a few of them
taking a drink.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.540
-Sp|it up?
-Shh.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.583
Stop talking, man.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.535
[sighs]

00:48.007 --> 00:53.218
And remember, if you see
something, shoot something.

01:19.622 --> 01:20.987
[gunshot]

01:28.005 --> 01:29.666
Mitch?

01:29.882 --> 01:31.418
Mitch!

01:31.634 --> 01:32.464
Mitch!

01:48.484 --> 01:49.815
[sighs]

01:58.369 --> 02:00.109
Walt. Hey.

02:00.329 --> 02:03.366
Morning.
Uh, I brought you mail.

02:05.418 --> 02:08.376
Yeah.
I was gonna get that.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.589
Coffee, anything?

02:14.218 --> 02:16.379
Make some coffee?
Okay.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.096
[clears throat]

02:18.306 --> 02:19.341
[shoes scraping]

02:19.557 --> 02:23.641
[sighs]
Um, I haven't had time...

02:23.853 --> 02:25.343
Plants and mail and stuff.

02:25.563 --> 02:29.647
I've just, um, been so busy
with work and everything,

02:29.859 --> 02:32.316
| just, um, haven't had time,
you know, so...

02:32.528 --> 02:35.315
-Vic, um --
-You know, it's usually nice.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.897
You know, like,
just nice, cute little house,

02:38.117 --> 02:41.075
but, like, with work
and everything, ljust, um...

02:41.287 --> 02:42.823
-Vic, um...
-...ran out of time. Yeah.

02:43.039 --> 02:46.327
l, uh, don't know how to say
what I'm about to say,

02:46.542 --> 02:48.123
so I'm just gonna say it.

02:49.754 --> 02:50.960
l have to evict you.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.551
What? No.

02:59.764 --> 03:01.880
Uh... Sean's company

03:02.099 --> 03:04.636
gave us this, um --
him -- this house

03:04.852 --> 03:07.514
as part of his package,
and ljust, um...

03:07.730 --> 03:08.890
[sighs]

03:12.693 --> 03:15.901
Shit. Uh, they have been
sending these notices,

03:16.113 --> 03:18.775
and H just didn't
really look at them

03:18.991 --> 03:20.492
and paid much attention to them.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.157
I've just been so...

03:22.370 --> 03:23.530
-l'l| -- I'll get it.
-Sorry.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.112
...busy with work
and everything.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.165
Vic, should I be worried
about you?

03:30.378 --> 03:31.868
What?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.995
God, no, no.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.423
l have been to your place.

03:37.635 --> 03:40.342
-[laughs]
-Fair enough.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.046
Anyway, I brought some boxes.
I can help you move.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.010
Today?

03:47.687 --> 03:50.178
Right.
Of course, it's eviction day.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.156
I'm early.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.533
This desk was empty,
but I can -- I can move.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.335
Oh, no, no.
Um, no, that's your desk.

04:15.548 --> 04:16.663
Okay.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.292
[sighs]

04:21.512 --> 04:23.173
Anything I can do?

04:24.265 --> 04:27.598
Uh, it's eviction day.

04:27.810 --> 04:31.974
Just, uh, a lot of paperwork.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.225
Um, you know...

04:35.234 --> 04:37.395
-Okay.
-Happy to help.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.354
Oh [scoffs] pretty complicated.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.905
All right.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.949
I'll be -- be here.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.950
I'll just, uh...

04:58.132 --> 04:59.417
-[Mitch] Hey, man.
-Hey.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.214
[Mitch] We, uh,
need to report something.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.543
-Crime report?
-Not really.

05:03.763 --> 05:06.254
We just, uh, saw something
while we were out hunting.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.840
You can take this one.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.924
[clears throat]
Come in, guys.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.188
All right, take a seat.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.103
Be right with you.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.851
Here.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.646
Is there a form or something
I should get them to fill out?

05:23.866 --> 05:27.108
Uh, all the forms
are in the card-catalog room.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.360
So...

05:31.373 --> 05:32.533
Yep. There.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.993
[Mitch] I told him to shoot
if he heard anything,

05:38.214 --> 05:40.500
and,uh,
that's exactly what he did.

05:41.801 --> 05:43.587
Uh, l-l thought it was a deer.

05:43.803 --> 05:46.590
And that's when you saw
the girl -- after you shot?

05:46.806 --> 05:48.046
Yeah.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.971
All right.
What did she look like?

05:50.184 --> 05:54.097
Indian.
Uh, uh, Native American.

05:55.940 --> 06:01.651
Uh, she had on a blue top
with, uh, flowers, I think,

06:01.862 --> 06:04.820
and, uh, um, no pants.

06:06.158 --> 06:09.275
Just a shirt and underwear.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.031
[Zach]
No pants, no shirt.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.746
After I shot,
she didn't scream or anything.

06:14.959 --> 06:19.498
And after she saw me,
she took off running.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.999
So I didn't think
she was injured.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.800
But... I just want to make sure.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.592
You didn't call 911?

06:27.805 --> 06:29.090
We are 911.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.092
We went to Fish and Game,
but they said

06:31.308 --> 06:33.765
since another person was
involved, we got to come to you.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.515
All right, uh [clears throat]

06:36.730 --> 06:38.061
can you show me
where this happened?

06:38.274 --> 06:39.309
[clears throat]
Yeah, man.

06:41.694 --> 06:44.026
Yeah. Let's see.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.069
It was right --
It was right there.

06:46.282 --> 06:49.991
-Yeah, right there. Yeah.
-[Ferg] Okay, thanks, guys.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.612
We'll let you know
if anything turns up.

06:51.829 --> 06:52.818
Okay? Thank you.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.244
[Zach]
This way.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.038
Welcome to the exciting life
of an Absaroka deputy.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.716
Standing Bear,
I need a good lawyer.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.888
Can you put me in touch
with Cady Longmire?

07:14.727 --> 07:16.308
Happy to.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.602
-Cady?
-Yep?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.934
-[May] Oh.
-What's going on?

07:26.405 --> 07:29.772
Um, I need your help.

07:29.992 --> 07:35.612
[sighs] A neighbor of ours,
Gabriella Langton, was attacked.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.042
Where is she?
Is she okay?

07:39.251 --> 07:41.742
She's outside in my car.
She didn't want to come in.

07:43.339 --> 07:46.046
She ran to our house
after being out all night.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.089
She was half-dressed
and in shock.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.042
What happened?

07:50.262 --> 07:51.843
She was raped.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.010
Okay, thanks.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.182
Even the Crossroads Motel
is completely booked.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.771
That is the fifth place
I have tried

07:59.980 --> 08:02.471
with no vacancy
because of that damn casino.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.773
You know what? I'm gonna go
check it out in person.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.646
-[Walt] Why?
-Someone once told me

08:06.862 --> 08:07.942
that a face-to-face interaction

08:08.155 --> 08:09.520
is better than a phone call.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.074
Cady is in your office.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.996
We came here
with May Stillwater.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.120
Is May's daughter
in some kind of trouble?

08:23.045 --> 08:24.956
Not her daughter, no.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.723
Sheriff, this is Gab --
Gabriella.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.151
But we've called her Gab
since she was a little girl.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.103
She was a chatterbox.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.860
Always full of stories
and jokes,

08:54.076 --> 08:56.158
so "Gab" stuck.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.906
Gab?

09:00.416 --> 09:02.372
This is Sheriff Longmire.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.794
Hi, there, Gab.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.500
She grew up
just down the street from me,

09:12.720 --> 09:15.211
so I've known her
for a long, long time.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.296
[Henry] And I was her coach
in high school.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.721
She has got a killer hook shot.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.765
Early this morning,

09:28.027 --> 09:31.019
Gab ran to our house
after being out all night.

09:33.615 --> 09:38.075
She told my daughter Lilly
that...

09:38.287 --> 09:39.697
she was raped.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.951
Gab, are you hurt?

09:49.506 --> 09:52.418
May, did you take Gab
to the hospital or doctor?

09:52.634 --> 09:55.341
Yes. First thing I did was take
her to the Res health clinic.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.340
And then I went to see Henry,

09:57.598 --> 09:59.509
'cause I knew we'd need
a good lawyer.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.842
And now we're here.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.027
[sighs]

10:19.828 --> 10:22.410
Gab, can you tell me
what happened last night?

10:30.798 --> 10:34.666
You know, whatever happened...
it's not your fault.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.218
Did you know the person
that did this to you?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.436
Can you tell me
what they looked like?

10:55.656 --> 11:00.366
Gab, anything that you can
remember will help us.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.832
I think he had a beard.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.329
Can you tell me
if he was Indian or white or...

11:09.545 --> 11:10.785
White.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.794
Where did this happen?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.717
She said she was out
at some party.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.015
Did you know anybody
at this party?

11:35.988 --> 11:37.899
Where did the party happen?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.155
Outside.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.705
On the Res somewhere.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.669
There was a bonfire.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.669
You sure it was on the Res?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.967
lthink so.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.683
[Walt] Gab, is there a reason
you didn't go home?

12:14.818 --> 12:17.560
Is there a reason
you didn't tell your mother?

12:25.287 --> 12:27.494
I shouldn't have told anyone.

12:30.876 --> 12:31.991
[Cady]
What do you think?

12:33.712 --> 12:35.953
I don't have jurisdiction
on the Res, Pumpkin.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.504
Based on what we heard in there,

12:37.716 --> 12:38.956
you can't take it to trial,
so...

12:39.176 --> 12:41.337
No, I can't.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.929
But I can help find

12:43.138 --> 12:44.753
a federal prosecutor
who will take the case.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.719
| just need to get the feds
some convincing evidence.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.891
Dad, I need an investigator.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.968
Sheriff, sorry to interrupt.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.429
Um, the girl
who just left this office

12:53.649 --> 12:55.105
matched a report I took earlier.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.853
Two hunters saw

12:57.069 --> 12:58.104
a barefoot Native girl
running in the woods.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.651
Said she was only wearing
a shirt,

12:59.863 --> 13:01.319
a blue, flowery shirt
like the girl had on.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.520
Where were they
when they saw her?

13:02.741 --> 13:03.491
Uh, here.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.906
Um...

13:10.082 --> 13:10.912
Here.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.243
That's not on the Res.
Gab wasn't raped on the Res.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.999
I'll investigate this
as my own case.

13:18.215 --> 13:22.504
Cady, let's you and I head over
to the Res health clinic,

13:22.719 --> 13:24.971
see if there's any physical
evidence that can help us.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.922
Zach, you and Ferg head out
to where she was first sighted.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.927
Take the two hunters
who saw her.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.306
See if you can pinpoint
exactly where this happened.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.728
Let's go, Punk.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.734
[Cady] Thank God May took Gab
to the Res clinic.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.160
I mean, with a rape kit,
atleast

13:50.372 --> 13:52.237
we'll have
some physical evidence.

13:52.457 --> 13:56.120
That's good, 'cause Gab didn't
give us too much information.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.920
Just give her a little time.
And when she's ready, she'll --

14:01.133 --> 14:03.089
She might not ever be ready.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.217
You were really good with her.

14:08.307 --> 14:10.764
If she'll talk to anyone,
it's gonna be to you.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.223
What's with the boxes?

14:16.440 --> 14:19.523
[Walt] Vic got evicted.
I'm helping her move.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.271
You are?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.026
What about Sean?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.859
Vic and Sean got divorced.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.237
Oh, God.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.785
Is she okay?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.450
I wanted to ask you
how you'd feel about,

14:34.666 --> 14:38.124
uh, Vic staying
in your spare room temporarily.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.707
Um, weird.
[chuckles]

14:44.926 --> 14:47.133
Yeah, I'd -- I'd feel --
I'd feel weird.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.131
[Walt]
Right.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.546
[Cady]
Can she stay in a hotel?

14:51.767 --> 14:54.554
Well, she tried, but they're
all booked for the casino.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.010
Can she stay with you?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.810
No.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.729
I wanted to wait, you know,
for a-a real doctor,

15:06.948 --> 15:09.109
but Gab was too spooked.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.236
She wasn't gonna wait.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.692
And May, she insisted

15:11.912 --> 15:14.073
I do something, so...

15:20.670 --> 15:23.798
So,yeah.
So I did the best I could.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.668
But...

15:25.884 --> 15:27.215
[Walt]
But what?

15:27.928 --> 15:30.465
She had already taken a shower
before she got here.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.298
And she was so embarrassed,
you know?

15:34.518 --> 15:35.758
She didn't want me
to do anything.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.259
She just wanted to go home.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.936
[sighs]
It was really difficult.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.855
And the clinic doesn't have
any rape kits, so...

15:43.068 --> 15:44.228
What?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.606
We do the best we can
with what we have.

15:47.823 --> 15:49.233
I know all of the things --

15:49.449 --> 15:51.861
uh, the procedures
that you're supposed to do

15:52.077 --> 15:54.033
in these types of situations.

15:54.246 --> 15:58.740
I thought I got it all,
but... after she left,

15:58.959 --> 16:01.496
I realized that [sighs] I forgot

16:01.837 --> 16:03.702
to have her undress
on a sheet of white paper

16:03.922 --> 16:08.416
so they could collect any hair,
lint, or any of that stuff.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.503
Do you have anything,
any physical evidence?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.131
No.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.811
But I'm pretty sure --
pretty sure she was raped.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.767
That's not gonna hold up
in court.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.473
I'm sorry.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.229
I did the best I could
w-with everything that...

16:26.445 --> 16:27.935
[sighs]

16:28.155 --> 16:29.770
She was just so scared,
you know?

16:34.744 --> 16:37.235
[Ferg] You're sure she was
coming from this direction?

16:37.456 --> 16:38.741
[Mitch]
Pretty sure.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.670
Did you find the girl?

16:47.883 --> 16:50.090
I'm not authorized
to give you that information.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.712
Am I in trouble?

16:52.554 --> 16:54.010
Should you be?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.097
Looks like somebody
had a pretty good party.

17:07.277 --> 17:11.816
You said the girl you saw
was wearing a blue blouse,
right?

17:14.743 --> 17:16.108
With flowers?

17:16.328 --> 17:17.283
[Seth]
Yeah.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.199
What are you doing?

17:21.791 --> 17:23.577
Can't go in there.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.078
Why not?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.411
Let me see the map.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.294
You see this?

17:33.386 --> 17:36.469
All this, it's all Res.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.932
We have no jurisdiction
anywhere beyond this fence.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.607
[sighs]

17:55.367 --> 17:57.153
She's lying down.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.401
I'm gonna stay with her
until her mother

17:59.621 --> 18:01.202
comes home from work.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.330
I could wait.

18:07.546 --> 18:09.582
It's fine, Standing Bear.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.754
Are we doing the right thing?

18:16.096 --> 18:18.553
It is our duty to help.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.464
It's just [sighs] I'm the one

18:21.685 --> 18:23.596
who's pushing her
to go after this.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.848
You saw her with Walt.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.979
She's...

18:28.733 --> 18:30.644
[sighs]

18:30.860 --> 18:33.112
All she wants
is for this to go away.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.772
Who am Ito interfere?
I'm not her mother.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.119
All of these children
belong to us.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.617
We have to push to get justice.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.788
Think about what happened
with your own daughter.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.961
Gab is going to need help
to restore her spirit.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.217
There is a sweat
off Walsh Road...

19:02.017 --> 19:04.759
...for women and girls
who have been... hurt.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.178
Takes place every third Sunday.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.639
A sweat?

19:10.859 --> 19:11.894
Just for this?

19:13.278 --> 19:15.360
How long has this been going on?

19:19.909 --> 19:22.116
[sighs]
Forever.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.175
They changed the law recently.
They could have come to me.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.641
No, they couldn't have.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.094
A white man rapes
a Native woman on the Res

19:49.314 --> 19:51.054
and he's a boyfriend
or a husband,

19:51.274 --> 19:54.266
-it's within my jurisdiction.
-He's a stranger.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.823
It happened on the Res,
so you can't do anything.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.366
The rapist is white
and a stranger,

20:03.578 --> 20:05.819
so I can't do anything.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.576
Neither one of us can officially
investigate this case.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.454
Cady's gonna take it
to a federal prosecutor.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.626
Tsk.
Yeah, good luck with that.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.748
I told Cady I'd help.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.503
She's not giving up on this one.

20:19.719 --> 20:23.257
She's, uh --
She's stubborn like that.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.597
She's gonna need
some sort of case

20:26.810 --> 20:28.846
for the feds to even consider
taking this on.

20:30.397 --> 20:37.360
You know, uh, we could
cross-deputize each other.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.440
So we'd each have jurisdiction

20:40.657 --> 20:43.945
in each other's district,
widen our reach.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.994
If I give you authority
on the Res,

20:48.206 --> 20:49.070
we'll have to get
everything we need

20:49.290 --> 20:50.541
in less than two weeks.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.828
'Cause that's how long I have

20:53.044 --> 20:55.251
before I'm drummed out of a job.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.189
Who leaves a $25 chip
lying around?

21:24.451 --> 21:26.362
White guys.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.569
[indistinct conversations]

21:38.423 --> 21:40.004
All right, Nighthorse agreed

21:40.216 --> 21:41.331
to give me access

21:41.551 --> 21:43.291
to security footage
from last night.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.421
Malachi is waiting.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.719
Did you tell him I was with you?

21:46.931 --> 21:48.262
I'm not stupid.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.509
-Hey, Matty.
-Hey.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.521
[Malachi]
So, Turner and Hooch,

21:57.734 --> 22:01.397
I'm supposed to show you
last night's security footage.

22:01.613 --> 22:03.649
You're supposed to show me.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.446
I'm just on a ride-along.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.274
We're looking for a victim.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.406
We need to know if she was here
and who she was with.

22:10.622 --> 22:11.953
Well, for the record,

22:12.248 --> 22:14.830
I told Nighthorse
to demand a warrant.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.409
But he's a softie, so --

22:17.629 --> 22:18.869
Stop, Malachi.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.124
Stop right there.
That one.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.082
Go back, please.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.760
Right there.
You know those guys?

22:30.308 --> 22:31.423
Maybe.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.551
Who are they?

22:36.606 --> 22:38.187
You're the brain trust.
You figure it out.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.981
Cut the crap, Malachi.
Tell us.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.900
You know, Mathias,

22:43.154 --> 22:47.614
I believe you arrested
one of my guys -- Curtis --

22:47.826 --> 22:49.407
couple of days ago.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.905
I think he didn't do it.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.279
Curtis was
a drunk and disorderly.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.616
Oh, well,
that's a matter of opinion.

23:00.505 --> 23:01.665
[Mathias] Ifl release him,

23:01.881 --> 23:03.382
you'll tell us
who these men are?

23:06.219 --> 23:07.834
-DeaL
-[scoffs]

23:09.681 --> 23:14.801
Yeah, these guys work
in the oil fields in Odin.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.884
Started coming in here
on their days off.

23:17.939 --> 23:20.646
Like craps, love poker.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.474
I'm happy to print you out
some stills

23:22.694 --> 23:24.980
if that would be any help.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.698
You're sticking your nose in
where it doesn't belong!

23:27.907 --> 23:29.522
Linda, I am just trying to help!

23:29.742 --> 23:31.357
If something happened to Lilly,
I would want you to --

23:31.578 --> 23:33.284
[Linda] Want me to mind
my own damn business!

23:33.496 --> 23:35.532
[sighs]
My daughter is in there

23:35.748 --> 23:37.955
traumatized
by what you made her do.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.501
Ms. Langton,
I'm Sheriff Longmire.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.123
What are you doing here?

23:43.339 --> 23:44.840
I thought Mathias
is the one who's supposed to --

23:45.049 --> 23:47.131
Mathias and I are working
together on this one.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.174
Ms. Stillwater
is just trying to help.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.343
Gab and I don't need any help.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.092
Ms. Langton,
we want to find this man.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.173
We want justice
for your daughter.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.509
Go -- Go inside

23:57.729 --> 24:00.516
and look at my daughter
curled up on that couch,

24:00.732 --> 24:05.852
shaking like a leaf,
too scared to say anything!

24:06.070 --> 24:09.904
And then I dare you to tell me
that justice can help us!

24:11.826 --> 24:13.737
Go.
You heard me.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.747
Go right ahead.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.873
[shoes scraping]

24:44.567 --> 24:49.687
Gab, uh, well [sighs]

24:51.240 --> 24:53.697
I understand that you were
at the casino last night.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.367
-The casino?
-No, I wasn't at the casino.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.537
These were pulled
from last night's security.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.832
[Linda] You can't pay me
so much as a nickel in rent,

25:03.044 --> 25:05.330
and you're putting money
into the slots?

25:05.546 --> 25:07.457
Where are you getting the cash,
Gabriella?

25:07.674 --> 25:08.914
-[Walt] Ms. Langton, please.
-[Linda] She can't seem

25:09.217 --> 25:10.252
to find a job,

25:10.468 --> 25:11.878
so she has to live here with me.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.962
And while I am
working myself to death,

25:15.181 --> 25:17.263
scrubbing motel toilets,

25:17.475 --> 25:19.807
she's out
just throwing money away?

25:20.019 --> 25:20.974
And you lie about it?

25:21.187 --> 25:22.848
Ms. Langton, May,

25:23.106 --> 25:25.313
can ljust have
a minute alone with Gab?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.186
Come on.

25:27.402 --> 25:28.858
What else
am I gonna find out, huh,

25:29.153 --> 25:31.109
that you were wearing
brand-new boots?

25:31.322 --> 25:32.152
Linda. Come on!

25:33.658 --> 25:34.943
I need a drink.

25:49.007 --> 25:51.168
Gab...

25:51.384 --> 25:55.502
is the man who attacked you...
in this photo?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.351
Can you point to him?

26:25.209 --> 26:27.120
So, there were two?

26:30.506 --> 26:33.373
But you're sure
these are the guys?

26:39.891 --> 26:41.256
Okay.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.736
[engines shut off]

26:57.533 --> 26:59.990
I'll hang back
in case anyone runs.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.169
[Walt]
Where can I find these two guys?

27:14.926 --> 27:16.416
What the hell, man?!

27:18.012 --> 27:19.798
I'm gonna ask you again.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.470
-Where can I find these guys?

27:21.724 --> 27:22.964
-They're in that one
right there.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.519
Ferg.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.105
Sheriff's Department!

27:33.861 --> 27:35.067
The hell are you?

27:37.698 --> 27:38.733
Get off me, man.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.325
Come here.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.196
Get up!
Get the hell up!

27:46.415 --> 27:47.700
-Get the hell up!
-What the hell?

27:47.917 --> 27:50.408
-On your feet!
-[indistinct shouting]

27:50.628 --> 27:52.209
Don't move!

27:52.421 --> 27:53.376
Shut up.

27:53.589 --> 27:54.544
-Got him?
-Got him.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.418
Let's go.

27:56.634 --> 27:57.999
Out.
All right, let's go.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.599
Ferg, phone.

28:16.737 --> 28:20.605
Hey, Punk,
we got two suspects in custody.

28:20.825 --> 28:23.692
I'll hold them while you meet
with the federal prosecutor.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.196
Yeah. Good luck.

28:42.889 --> 28:46.973
Sheriff Longmire.
Walker Browning.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.682
Heard you arrested
a couple of my guys.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.261
I had to come down here
and see what was what.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.016
You with the oil company?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.517
I'm their representative

28:54.734 --> 28:56.315
till the company's lawyers
can get here.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.644
Oh, you don't have to go, sugar.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.571
I'm sure me and you can share
that little bed just fine.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.866
You shut your goddamn mouth!
You hear me?!

29:06.078 --> 29:07.113
[grunts]
Do you hear me?!

29:07.330 --> 29:09.787
Yeah, yeah, man.
I hear you.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.790
Sheriff, these are good guys.

29:21.010 --> 29:23.672
No drugs, clean records,
report to work on time.

29:23.888 --> 29:25.173
They do a hell of a job.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.300
When their leave rolls around,

29:27.516 --> 29:29.507
yeah,
they like to have a good time.

29:29.727 --> 29:32.139
Got to blow off some steam.
You know how that goes.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.311
But rape?
You got to be kidding me.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.016
Now, where did this
supposedly happen?

29:38.236 --> 29:42.445
At a party in the woods,
a place near, uh --

29:42.657 --> 29:44.693
Yeah. Near Eberwine Creek.
I know the place.

29:44.909 --> 29:47.525
The guys sometimes build a fire
and party over there.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.201
Oh, they can be loud,

29:49.413 --> 29:51.790
shooting off firecrackers,
all that horse shit.

29:54.669 --> 29:56.409
That, uh, area,

29:56.629 --> 29:57.584
the clearing
where they hang out,

29:57.797 --> 29:58.627
isn't that on the Res?

30:01.008 --> 30:01.997
That's right.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.888
only tribal police have
jurisdiction on the Res.

30:10.101 --> 30:14.219
I'm holding the suspects --
your guys --

30:14.438 --> 30:17.020
till the federal prosecutor
gets here.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.733
The feds? Damn.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.531
You must have some

30:27.743 --> 30:28.994
pretty compelling evidence
against them.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.203
God damn it!

30:34.333 --> 30:37.075
Okay, I take pride in my guys.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.666
God damn it.

30:46.721 --> 30:48.803
Look, if they really did this...

30:51.559 --> 30:53.265
...throw the book at them.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.978
Ms. Longmire,
the lack

31:05.197 --> 31:07.574
of a hospital-issued rape kit
and any DNA evidence,

31:07.783 --> 31:09.489
on top of the unreliability
of the victim's account,

31:09.702 --> 31:12.409
already make it almost
impossible to try.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.828
I wish it were different, but...

31:15.041 --> 31:16.406
we can't throw money
at a lost cause.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.583
Gab deserves more.
These women deserve more.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.296
You know, Ms. Longmire,
earlier this year,

31:21.505 --> 31:23.211
the Violence Against Women Act
was passed.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.039
If Gabriella's attacker
was her boyfriend --

31:25.217 --> 31:28.630
She didn't know her rapists.
They were strangers.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.889
-They?
-[Cady] Gab was raped

31:31.098 --> 31:33.350
by two different men,
Mrs. Bradley --

31:33.559 --> 31:35.720
oil-rig workers
that she was partying with.

31:35.936 --> 31:36.971
Oil-rig workers?

31:39.065 --> 31:42.307
I had the exact situation happen
in North Dakota.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.518
Guys from the Bakken shale
fields raping girls on the Res

31:45.738 --> 31:47.478
because they knew
they could get away with it.

31:47.698 --> 31:50.360
Mrs. Bradley, if these guys know

31:50.576 --> 31:52.532
there will never
even be an attempt to stop them,

31:52.745 --> 31:54.406
they will keep doing it.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.613
But a federal prosecutor
investigating,

31:56.832 --> 31:57.912
even if it doesn't go to trial,

31:58.125 --> 31:59.581
may serve as a disincentive.

32:01.170 --> 32:04.162
They have to know
that there are consequences.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.544
This is really good, Dad.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.422
I think she's gonna consider
taking the case.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.424
I mean, this is a huge deal.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.557
Of course, Gab is gonna
have to meet with her.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.350
She's gonna need a detailed

32:18.562 --> 32:20.018
first-person account
of the assault.

32:20.231 --> 32:24.474
Hopefully, Gab can give her
some, you know, details.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.644
Also, the prosecutor
is going to bring

32:27.863 --> 32:29.399
a sexual-assault nurse examiner,

32:29.615 --> 32:30.695
'cause they can do a rape kit

32:30.950 --> 32:32.315
up to 72 hours
after the assault,

32:32.535 --> 32:33.900
and it's still admissible
in court.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.906
Gab is gonna have
to go through all that again?

32:37.123 --> 32:38.659
It's the only way.

32:38.874 --> 32:41.160
I mean, the Res-clinic exam
isn't gonna cut it.

32:43.504 --> 32:47.747
And I was hoping that maybe
you could bring it up with Gab.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.003
-Me?
-Norma|ly, I'd say

32:50.219 --> 32:51.880
that a woman should do it,
but in this case,

32:52.096 --> 32:56.886
I mean, you're the only one
she really responded to earlier.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.270
You're really good with her,
Dad.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.349
You treat her like you treat me.

33:05.943 --> 33:07.399
You know, I always assumed

33:07.611 --> 33:09.693
that you had to be really tough
for your job.

33:11.282 --> 33:15.321
Never occurred to me
that you were... just you.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.793
I thought about it,
and I'd be happy

33:27.006 --> 33:29.088
to have Vic stay with me
for a while.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.297
Yeah.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.058
[engine shuts off]

33:42.062 --> 33:43.677
She's gone!

33:43.898 --> 33:45.479
[Walt]
Ms. Langton, just take a breath.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.023
You!
You scared her off.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.100
-She's run away!
-Gab ran away?

33:50.321 --> 33:51.606
[Linda]
Of course she ran away.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.608
You people scared her off.

33:53.824 --> 33:57.032
She's terrified of you guys
poking and prodding at her.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.780
Ms. Langton, what happened?

33:58.996 --> 34:01.453
Said that she was gonna meet me
at the Blind Tiger,

34:01.665 --> 34:03.747
but she never showed up.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.120
And since they don't got
a phone, I couldn't call,

34:06.337 --> 34:08.373
so I walked over here,
and Ms. Langton said

34:08.631 --> 34:10.747
that she had left
an hour before.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.706
Leave.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.009
And don't come back.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.337
We're done here.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.357
[rock music playing]

34:37.284 --> 34:39.536
[Walt]
Cady found a federal prosecutor.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.911
We can't find the victim.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.034
So I need your help, Henry.

34:45.334 --> 34:47.120
I will get a cover for my shift,
and I will meet you --

34:47.336 --> 34:49.622
[Malachi] It's not surprising
that the girl ran away.

34:51.173 --> 34:53.630
She knows she's not
gonna see any justice.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.170
-[glass thuds]
-Ah.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.757
Oliphant vs. Suquamish, 1978,

35:02.977 --> 35:04.183
stripped the tribe of its rights

35:04.395 --> 35:07.011
to arrest and prosecute
non-Indians.

35:07.231 --> 35:08.937
I guess you was scared
we would, uh,

35:09.149 --> 35:11.435
scalp you if we got some power.

35:11.652 --> 35:12.858
But you did get power.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.651
[Malachi]
Not the right power, Walter.

35:14.863 --> 35:17.115
See, when a white man
hands you a law,

35:17.324 --> 35:19.235
you have to pay attention
to the loopholes.

35:19.451 --> 35:23.410
See, they figured
if a white man was stupid enough

35:23.622 --> 35:26.989
to date or marry an Indian girl,

35:27.209 --> 35:28.824
he has to suffer
the consequences.

35:29.044 --> 35:32.582
But all other non-Natives
are still protected,

35:32.798 --> 35:35.130
so we're right
back where we started.

35:35.342 --> 35:36.627
We are not back where we --

35:36.844 --> 35:39.130
[Malachi] All you ever did
was shame a girl

35:39.346 --> 35:40.927
and cause a mother
to lose her daughter.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.973
At least when I was in charge,
we had some justice.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.014
[scoffs]

35:48.355 --> 35:52.394
Oh, and, uh, Hank...
you can't get out of your shift.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.646
You've missed too much work
already.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.477
[laughs]

36:00.075 --> 36:02.236
[sighs, grunts]

36:06.832 --> 36:08.163
Hi.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.955
Your dad told me that he talked
to you about this.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.332
He did. He did.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.415
Um, it's fine.
Come in.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.341
-Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.168
Come in, come in.
You can put that down.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.253
-Okay.
-Uh, right there.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.354
[sighs]

36:29.563 --> 36:33.681
Um, I'm, uh -- I'm really sorry.

36:33.901 --> 36:39.362
My dad told me that you --
well, about the divorce.

36:39.573 --> 36:40.983
Yeah.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.657
That.
[chuckles]

36:45.287 --> 36:46.823
[clears throat]

36:48.749 --> 36:51.161
Well, this --
this is the guest room...

36:51.377 --> 36:53.333
-Okay.
-...where you will be staying.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.330
[chuckles]

36:54.546 --> 36:55.672
[Vic]
Great.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.169
Thank you. Just, um --

36:59.385 --> 37:01.467
Just until a hotel room
opens up.

37:01.679 --> 37:05.342
Stay as long as you want.
Really.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.049
Absaroka can be tough
on us single ladies.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.975
Yeah.
[laughs]

37:12.648 --> 37:14.934
Do you have any food
or anything? You want to...

37:15.150 --> 37:17.482
Come on.
[laughs]

37:27.579 --> 37:29.911
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop them.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.410
Gab didn't run away.
She was kidnapped.

37:32.626 --> 37:35.993
Linda found this ransom note
in her mailbox this morning.

37:36.213 --> 37:38.545
It says that Gab
will only be released

37:38.757 --> 37:40.964
if all rape charges against
those oil workers are dropped.

37:41.176 --> 37:44.009
I ran to May's
to get her to drive me here.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.086
Please, Sheriff.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.762
Please find my daughter.

37:47.975 --> 37:50.011
Ms. Langton,
Vic will stay with you

37:50.310 --> 37:52.562
in case they try
to contact you again.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.057
I'm not going back to the house.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.481
It's okay, Ms. Langton, you'll
be safe. I'll be with you.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.359
I was supposed to be at work
30 minutes ago.

38:00.571 --> 38:02.061
If I don't get on a bus
right now,

38:02.322 --> 38:03.482
I'm gonna be an hour late.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.196
Vic, um, go to the Langton house
and stay posted there.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.490
We're gonna find Gab.

38:10.706 --> 38:12.162
Linda,
I'll drive you to the motel.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.989
That way,
you won't have to take the bus.

38:20.716 --> 38:22.456
Do we even have the right guys
in custody,

38:22.676 --> 38:25.213
or are the real rapists still
out there holding Gab hostage?

38:32.895 --> 38:33.725
[Walt]
Let's go.

38:55.793 --> 38:57.875
[laughs]

38:58.086 --> 38:59.041
[clears throat]

39:10.974 --> 39:13.090
Ferg, Zach, trail them.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.596
See where they take you,
who they take you to.

39:15.813 --> 39:17.974
I'll have Ruby put a flag
on both of them.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.768
I'm gonna follow
a different lead.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.447
I can't help you, man.
I don't know anything.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.868
[Walt] I think you can help me,
actually.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.866
You were with Gab that night
at the casino.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.287
Listen, I know Gab's mom

39:40.504 --> 39:41.994
was pissed off
that we were at the casino,

39:42.214 --> 39:44.500
but if I had to live
in that house with that bitch,

39:44.716 --> 39:46.252
I'd want to run away, too.

39:46.468 --> 39:49.631
Gab didn't run away, Mandy.
She was kidnapped.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.054
I believe she was kidnapped
by one of the men in this photo.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.592
I believe these are also the men
that raped her.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.720
Now, you weren't there for Gab
when she was raped.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.977
How about you be there for her
now, before she gets killed?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.108
I met Will and Tyler.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.571
Who are these guys?

40:06.780 --> 40:08.566
I need names.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.357
The only one I know is him.

40:12.369 --> 40:13.984
Partied with him before.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.364
The other guys, they're new,

40:15.581 --> 40:16.570
but it was always
the same party.

40:16.790 --> 40:18.621
They would buy us drinks,

40:18.834 --> 40:21.246
give us chips,
and we'd have a good time.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.076
Thought Gab needed a break
from that bitch,

40:23.297 --> 40:24.707
so I brought her along with me,

40:24.923 --> 40:26.504
and I thought
that she would have fun.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.839
That guy, he didn't touch Gab.

40:32.055 --> 40:35.047
Not today, not yesterday,
nothing.

40:35.976 --> 40:37.637
And I know that for sure.

40:38.937 --> 40:39.926
Why for sure?

40:43.275 --> 40:45.106
'Cause he was with me.

40:45.319 --> 40:46.434
Where?

40:49.156 --> 40:50.145
His place.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.026
The barracks?

40:52.242 --> 40:53.903
With eight guys to a room?

40:54.119 --> 40:57.407
No. His little spot.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.622
His unit.

41:00.834 --> 41:03.871
-His storage unit?
-[|ighter clicking]

41:04.087 --> 41:05.827
When exactly were you with him?

41:06.048 --> 41:08.585
That night
until yesterday afternoon.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.633
This guy you were with,
what's his name?

41:12.554 --> 41:13.509
I don't know.

41:13.722 --> 41:14.677
You don't know?

41:15.891 --> 41:17.597
No, I don't know.

41:17.809 --> 41:18.935
And I don't want to know.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.639
You know,
my mother always told me

41:21.897 --> 41:23.307
to keep my mouth shut
and never name names,

41:23.523 --> 41:25.104
and now I know why.

41:27.361 --> 41:29.898
Look what happened to Gab
after she said something, huh?

41:33.909 --> 41:36.651
And now no one
is gonna do anything about it.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.986
What am [doing here?

41:42.417 --> 41:43.953
[Ferg] You know, I mean,
that's why I like

41:44.169 --> 41:45.670
using my personal vehicle
for work.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.795
It's just great
for surveillance.

41:49.007 --> 41:52.090
It's just not your typical,
you know, unmarked car.

41:59.393 --> 42:00.883
Hey.

42:01.103 --> 42:03.094
What are you doing?

42:03.313 --> 42:04.098
Zach?

42:06.525 --> 42:07.560
Zach!

42:14.658 --> 42:16.194
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?!

42:16.410 --> 42:18.275
I'm getting photos
that we can show our next victim

42:18.495 --> 42:19.826
so she can identify her rapist,

42:20.122 --> 42:22.033
'cause I know
it's gonna happen again.

42:24.084 --> 42:25.949
And I know it's gonna be
one of you assholes.

42:41.643 --> 42:42.974
Hey! Hey!

42:50.235 --> 42:51.065
Come on.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.029
Come on!

43:02.873 --> 43:05.034
So, what happened out there,
Ferg?

43:06.918 --> 43:10.536
Sheriff...
I'm gonna be honest with you.

43:14.176 --> 43:16.588
I'm not so sure
about this new guy.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.543
He pushes too hard.

43:19.723 --> 43:23.966
He was provoking those guys
at the camp, filming them.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.062
And what did you do?

43:26.271 --> 43:29.934
I just tried
to stay out of the way.

43:30.150 --> 43:31.390
I expect better of you.

43:31.610 --> 43:33.692
You're the senior deputy.

43:33.904 --> 43:35.314
If you thought
he was doing the wrong thing,

43:35.530 --> 43:37.191
you should have stopped it.

43:37.407 --> 43:39.489
So, was Zachary out of line?

43:40.660 --> 43:43.447
Do you need to file a report
of inappropriate behavior?

43:46.208 --> 43:47.368
No.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.955
No.

43:52.672 --> 43:55.004
[Zach] Sheriff,
you got to come see this.

44:10.941 --> 44:15.184
This guy here...
matches the casino still.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.026
[Ferg] Do you think this guy
could be involved

44:21.243 --> 44:22.198
in the rape, Sheriff?

44:22.410 --> 44:23.946
[Zach]
Or the kidnapping?

44:25.831 --> 44:27.696
[Walt]
We'll know soon enough.

44:29.126 --> 44:32.835
Hey.
So, it's been dead quiet here.

44:33.046 --> 44:34.547
Linda is still at work,
and there's no sign

44:34.756 --> 44:36.371
of Gab or anybody else.

44:36.591 --> 44:37.671
Where you at?

44:37.884 --> 44:39.169
[Walt]
I'm at storage,

44:39.386 --> 44:40.967
following up on something I saw

44:41.179 --> 44:43.966
in a video Zachary shot
at the oil-company barracks.

44:47.102 --> 44:49.718
You know, if you tell me
what you're looking for,

44:49.938 --> 44:52.020
I can help you find it
a whole lot easier.

44:52.232 --> 44:54.473
[Walt] I just need to take
a look at all the lockers

44:54.693 --> 44:56.308
rented by employees
of that oil company.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.439
-Where's the next one?
-[sighs] Back there.

45:01.408 --> 45:02.944
[sighing]

45:18.884 --> 45:21.250
There you go.
More of the same.

45:22.721 --> 45:25.463
Who rents that one?
Different lock.

45:27.434 --> 45:29.049
Huh.

45:29.269 --> 45:31.601
That's strange.
I don't, uh --

45:31.813 --> 45:33.053
I don't have a record
of this unit

45:33.273 --> 45:34.934
being rented out this month.

45:35.150 --> 45:37.015
Number 11.

45:37.986 --> 45:41.274
8... 9... 10.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.445
Oh, 11 there.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.157
It said "11" right on the key.

45:54.377 --> 45:55.913
That's the right key.

46:02.177 --> 46:03.792
It's just the wrong lock.

46:04.012 --> 46:05.092
Stay back, Bart.

46:16.858 --> 46:19.270
[breathing heavily]

46:20.237 --> 46:22.102
[muffled sobbing]

47:08.451 --> 47:10.942
[Cady] Did she recognize
her kidnappers?

47:11.162 --> 47:12.868
No.

47:13.081 --> 47:14.992
There were two of them wearing
masks when she was abducted.

47:15.208 --> 47:16.869
But the good news is,
is that Gab and her mom

47:17.085 --> 47:19.041
aren't gonna be pressured
into dropping the charges.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.540
Well, we probably have
a stronger case now than ever.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.041
Where is Mrs. Langton?

47:23.258 --> 47:24.498
In Gab's room.

47:28.471 --> 47:29.551
How is she?

47:30.473 --> 47:32.509
Okay.

47:32.726 --> 47:35.183
Ms. Langton, the last thing
we want to do is push you.

47:36.730 --> 47:38.345
is ready to file on this

47:38.565 --> 47:39.850
but not until she speaks
with Gab.

47:40.066 --> 47:41.146
So if you could please
let us know

47:41.359 --> 47:42.439
when Gab is ready to talk.

47:42.652 --> 47:44.313
Oh, I can tell you right now...

47:44.529 --> 47:45.939
Gab isn't gonna talk.

47:47.407 --> 47:49.614
But in order to move forward
with the case --

47:49.826 --> 47:52.488
There is no case.
Gab is not pressing charges.

47:52.704 --> 47:55.161
There's no more ransom.
I found her.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.113
Good for you,

47:57.334 --> 48:00.246
since you are the reason she was
taken in the first place.

48:00.462 --> 48:03.454
Listen, the feds rarely pursue
cases like this.

48:03.673 --> 48:04.879
The fact that they are
is encouraging.

48:05.091 --> 48:07.047
Are the Feds gonna pay my rent?

48:07.260 --> 48:09.467
'Cause I don't need justice.

48:09.679 --> 48:11.385
I need to pay the rent.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.885
Yeah.

48:15.101 --> 48:18.059
Did someone, uh,
come to see you at work?

48:19.397 --> 48:21.683
They pay you
to drop the charges?

48:22.984 --> 48:28.274
Buy you a new phone...
a couple months' rent?

48:31.242 --> 48:35.406
A lot of bad things happen
to a lot of women out here.

48:38.958 --> 48:41.415
had the good luck
to be raped by a white guy.

48:46.466 --> 48:47.751
You can't do this.

48:47.926 --> 48:50.884
You have your picture
ofjustice.

48:51.096 --> 48:52.176
l have mine.

48:52.389 --> 48:53.344
Who paid you?

48:53.556 --> 48:55.262
Women on the Res

48:55.558 --> 48:58.140
are taught
to keep their mouths shut.

48:58.353 --> 49:00.309
That's what my mother taught me,

49:00.605 --> 49:02.937
and that's what I tried
to teach Gab.

49:04.401 --> 49:07.518
Thank you.
Thank you all.

49:07.737 --> 49:10.695
Because with your help...

49:10.907 --> 49:13.694
I think that she finally
learned.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.035
Goodbye.

49:25.797 --> 49:27.287
Bye-bye.

49:41.646 --> 49:43.853
Well, that sucked.

49:46.109 --> 49:47.098
[sighs]

50:23.521 --> 50:25.807
[women singing
in native language]

51:08.816 --> 51:09.942
[medicine woman] Gab...

51:11.694 --> 51:15.858
...or as the spirits know you...

51:16.074 --> 51:18.065
Morning Star.

51:20.495 --> 51:23.157
A part of you was taken away.

51:24.624 --> 51:29.914
Someone took
what did not belong to them.

51:32.006 --> 51:36.420
That part of you
is now wandering...

51:36.636 --> 51:38.592
and lost.

51:42.517 --> 51:48.103
This is why you feel...
like you don't belong.

51:54.445 --> 51:58.484
I'm now going to call
that part of you back.

52:02.704 --> 52:04.160
[pot clanks]

52:06.791 --> 52:10.500
Come back, Morning Star.

52:10.712 --> 52:13.249
[women singing
in native language]

52:13.464 --> 52:17.582
Come back, Morning Star.

52:19.512 --> 52:24.097
Come back, Morning Star.

52:24.309 --> 52:25.515
[indistinct talking]

52:25.727 --> 52:29.595
[voice breaking]
Come back, Morning Star.

52:29.814 --> 52:32.226
[ululating]

52:44.078 --> 52:45.693
Morning Star...

52:47.790 --> 52:50.247
...call yourself back.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.961
[breathing heavily]

53:08.936 --> 53:13.805
Come back, Morning Star.

53:14.025 --> 53:16.107
[sobbing]

53:27.705 --> 53:30.788
[women singing softly
in native language]

54:02.407 --> 54:03.487
[Henry] May?

54:04.992 --> 54:06.778
This can't be how it ends.

54:06.994 --> 54:09.030
I won't stand for it.

54:11.457 --> 54:12.742
Where are you going?

54:14.544 --> 54:18.662
I'm gonna leave a note...
for Hector.
