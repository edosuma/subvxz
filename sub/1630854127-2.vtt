Police are removing boxes
and boxes of body parts

a psychopathic mass murder.

the suspect downtown.

Just who are the dismembered people
killed in this mass murder?

how anyone could have committed

01:31.341 --> 01:32.258

just as others in Milwaukee are wondering
how police couldn't have known,

Oh, too big for a rat.

That's an opossum.

Only marsupial in North America.

Don't know. Let's take a look.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.573

like somebody ate him.

Oh! Hang on a sec. Look at that.

He's got a hole in his skull. Right there.

Somebody must've bit through it.
Coyote or something. Look, it's crushed.

11:54.255 --> 11:58.467
Yeah, he must've gotten away
and run under here.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.177

what the brain can do.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.644
Take a lot of damage.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.398
You know, one of my professors,
we did this experiment

12:12.481 --> 12:16.068
where you take a frog
and you actually cut off his head.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.280
You take out most of the brain.
Just leave a small part, the stem,

12:19.363 --> 12:21.657
so he'll keep breathing,
his heart'll keep beating,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.200
but he can't think.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.368
Can't feel anything either.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.121
But then my professor showed us,

12:27.204 --> 12:30.124
you take a cotton ball, you dip it in acid

12:30.708 --> 12:34.378
and then dab it on the little bit of brain
that's left, and guess what?

12:34.462 --> 12:35.713
What?

12:35.796 --> 12:38.716
The frog's hands try
to wipe the cotton ball away.

Which, yeah, I know,
it shouldn't be able to do.

that knows how to do that is gone.
