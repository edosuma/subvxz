00:02.080 --> 00:03.920
QUACK!

00:03.920 --> 00:05.200
# Sarah and Duck. #

00:05.200 --> 00:06.280
QUACK!

00:08.800 --> 00:10.760
QUACK!

00:11.920 --> 00:13.160
QUACK!

00:14.960 --> 00:17.560
Today, Sarah is in the park

00:17.560 --> 00:20.040
showing Duck how to do roly-polies

00:20.040 --> 00:22.960
in a straight line.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.520
Think about straight things.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.960
SARAH TAKES A DEEP BREATH

00:27.960 --> 00:29.680
Stripes.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.000
Pencils.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.920
Very...

00:36.920 --> 00:38.400
..pencil-y.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.600
Thank you.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.040
Remember, straight things, chap.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.480
QUACK QUACK!

00:47.080 --> 00:50.800
QUACK!

00:50.800 --> 00:52.440
Tee-hee!

00:52.440 --> 00:54.600
Oh.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.080
Stop, Duck!

00:56.080 --> 00:58.040
QUACK...

00:58.040 --> 00:59.080
QUACK.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.320
Phew.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.440
Good roll, though.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.600
Uh-huh.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.840
QUACK!

01:03.840 --> 01:05.520
Oh.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.200
Those flowers look a bit
sorry for themselves.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.480
Hmm...

01:09.480 --> 01:10.720
Not to worry.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.520
There must be a gardener who can
tend to these flowers.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.880
Oh!

01:14.880 --> 01:17.400
Though, I've never seen one.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.440
Er, we'll find them.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.760
Come on, Duck.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.920
Gardener?

01:25.920 --> 01:28.080
QUACK QUACK?

01:28.080 --> 01:29.320
Gardener?

01:29.320 --> 01:31.040
QUACK QUACK?

01:31.040 --> 01:32.480
Hmm.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.360
Gardener?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.560
QUACK QUACK?

01:38.560 --> 01:40.800
Doesn't seem to be anyone around.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.000
Nope.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.240
QUACK

01:45.480 --> 01:46.960
Hello, Sarah.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.280
QUACK!

01:48.280 --> 01:50.200
Oh, hello.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.920
Are you the gardener?

01:52.920 --> 01:54.120
N-no.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.200
Are you?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.920
No.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.840
There's a shed over there.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.960
Maybe that's where the gardener is?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.120
Oh!

02:02.120 --> 02:03.920
Seems promising.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.160
Well, this definitely is
a gardener's tool shed,

02:10.160 --> 02:12.280
if a little unusual.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.120
Small gardener.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.640
Gardener?

02:17.640 --> 02:20.240
Perhaps we should
wait for the gardener to come out.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.800
Hmm, they're shy because we're not
flowers.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.520
What's that, Sarah?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.200
Ah.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.200
Quick, Duck! Be like a flower.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.480
QUACK QUACK QUACK

02:32.480 --> 02:34.400
Oh, I see.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.600
QUACK!

02:39.240 --> 02:42.480
I should go. My wheel is squeaky.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.560
Uh, OK. See you later.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.760
Shh!

02:45.760 --> 02:47.400
Oh, sorry...

02:48.640 --> 02:49.800
QUACK!

02:49.800 --> 02:52.400
Du-uck! We're flowers.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.920
CREAK

02:57.480 --> 02:59.200
Well, I never...

03:00.440 --> 03:01.760
Whoa!

03:11.720 --> 03:13.120
DING DING

03:21.320 --> 03:22.720
DING DING

03:28.000 --> 03:29.280
Hey!

03:33.800 --> 03:35.120
QUACK!

03:38.040 --> 03:40.360
Quick, Sarah. It's getting away.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.400
Ah, come on, Duck!

03:42.400 --> 03:43.640
QUACK!

04:10.160 --> 04:13.680
I think we might have
found our gardeners.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.720
Yes!

04:15.720 --> 04:16.960
DING DING

04:18.720 --> 04:21.360
Go on, Sarah. Now's your chance.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.040
Oh!

04:23.040 --> 04:24.720
Er, gardeners?

04:24.720 --> 04:26.800
Wait...

04:26.800 --> 04:29.320
There's a bit you missed. Ooh.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.720
Er...

04:31.720 --> 04:32.760
It's over here.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.360
This is the place.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.400
Hey...

04:50.400 --> 04:51.680
Hang on.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.280
Why won't you garden THIS flowerbed?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.280
"Please keep off the patch"?

05:02.320 --> 05:05.800
But don't you decide who can
go on the flowerbeds?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.160
No?

05:07.160 --> 05:08.240
Who then?

05:12.120 --> 05:14.200
Oo-ooh.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.600
Very old tool.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.680
Oh, I see.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.000
So you don't go on that bed

05:21.000 --> 05:24.120
out of respect for the old trowel.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.200
Hmm.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.640
It's a sign for shoes.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.800
You don't have any.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.560
The old trowel just didn't want

05:40.560 --> 05:41.640
big clumpy shoes

05:41.640 --> 05:43.640
stepping on the flowers.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.360
Besides, I'm sure it would

05:45.360 --> 05:47.120
have wanted you to keep

05:47.120 --> 05:48.520
ALL the flowerbeds nice.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.160
Yes!

05:54.160 --> 05:56.120
QUACK!

06:08.240 --> 06:09.440
QUACK

06:10.680 --> 06:11.920
QUACK

06:13.320 --> 06:15.280
QUACK

06:15.280 --> 06:17.160
QUACK QUACK!

06:38.000 --> 06:39.440
Oh, yes.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.760
Now that does look nice.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.920
It's good.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.520
QUACK!

06:45.520 --> 06:46.840
# Sarah and Duck

06:46.840 --> 06:48.800
QUACK!

06:48.800 --> 06:50.440
# Sarah and Duck

06:50.440 --> 06:52.400
QUACK!

06:52.400 --> 06:53.760
# Sarah and Duck

06:53.760 --> 06:55.720
QUACK!

06:55.720 --> 06:57.120
# Sarah and Duck

06:57.120 --> 06:58.160
QUACK!
