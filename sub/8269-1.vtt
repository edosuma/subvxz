WEBVTT

01:22.249 --> 01:23.501
Go!

01:24.710 --> 01:27.838
- You said there'd be no shooting!
- I said get the hell out of here!

01:29.799 --> 01:32.343
- Billy!
- Go!

01:43.813 --> 01:46.315
Stop it, Billy. No shooting.
You promised.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.442
Get out of here.

02:30.025 --> 02:34.780
Young lady, I should throw this at you
and sentence you as an adult,

02:36.157 --> 02:40.953
but since this is your first offense,
I'm going to give you a chance

02:41.287 --> 02:42.746
to redeem yourself.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.958
I am sending you to reform school.

02:47.543 --> 02:51.047
You shall be placed in the custody
of the juvenile facilities at Pridemore

02:52.006 --> 02:56.343
for a period of three years,
or until such time as the parole board

02:56.677 --> 02:59.597
determines your release.
Whichever comes first.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.986
- Move over.
- All right, all right.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.738
You scared?

03:16.363 --> 03:19.241
Not anymore,
now that I know the worst is over.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.868
I wish I knew.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.370
I can't stand being locked up.

03:23.787 --> 03:27.124
I'm a runaway. A foster home, third time.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.959
How long are you going in for?

03:29.793 --> 03:31.045
Just until I'm 18.

03:32.463 --> 03:33.964
Then I can live where I want.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.925
You think it's any easier then?

03:37.635 --> 03:39.553
Anything's easier
than living with fosters.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.680
- Ah, forget it. You're a girl.
- Be quiet!

03:43.849 --> 03:46.727
- This ain't no joy ride, girls.
- All right. Yes.

04:34.525 --> 04:35.901
Hey, what's with the tower?

04:36.235 --> 04:37.653
It used to be a water tower.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.238
Now, it's the voice of God.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.073
- Huh?
- You'll see.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.449
Let's go.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.916
Have to be barbed wire and stone walls.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.793
Don't kid yourself.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.379
Worst thing about this place
is the human wall.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.214
Here's the fresh meat.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.593
Nice to see you back, Nicky.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.179
I see I should have kept your file active.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.141
You can wipe your ass with my file, bitch.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.812
All right,
straight ahead to the infirmary,

05:12.146 --> 05:14.523
eyes front, no talking, single file.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.109
Order is the rule here.

05:17.443 --> 05:21.238
Strip down, showers to the left,
physical in 10 minutes.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.115
Get undressed, ladies.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.596
You're going to be inspected
inside and out, so get it clean.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.849
Happy hunting, pig.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.735
Shake out your hair.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.114
Turn around.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.911
Bend over.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.413
Spread 'em wide.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.959
Clothes in the hamper.
Be sure your name tag's on.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.588
Personals in the basket.
Move it on.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.050
Ragdoll, too, honey.
This ain't no kindergarten.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.010
No, please.
It's all I have.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.346
Come on, hand it over.
You're a big girl, now.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.556
Please, it was Joey's. I promised.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.643
Please. No, please, please.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.021
All right, all right.
It gets past me,

06:36.355 --> 06:39.691
but I'm not the final word here.
Clothes in the hamper.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.528
Be sure your name tags are on.
Personals in the basket.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.988
- Move it on.
- State your size.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.532
Small, medium, or large?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.075
Small.

06:48.659 --> 06:51.078
- Small.
- Don't worry about style.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.580
- Same this year as the last.
- Small.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.626
Medium.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.760
Come on in.
St down, Jennifer.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.475
- Friends call you Jenny?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.894
- May I?
- I guess so.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.691
Good, I'd like that.
I'm Dr. Norton, psychologist.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.652
I've been assigned here to work
with the girls on the inside.

07:24.153 --> 07:26.321
Listen to your problems, help you cope.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.074
I know it's difficult being in here.

07:29.575 --> 07:32.327
The judge said I might get parole.
When would that be?

07:32.744 --> 07:36.331
Well, you're here for three years,
so you won't be eligible

07:36.665 --> 07:38.876
for at least 14 months
and a lot of that depends

07:39.209 --> 07:40.836
on your behavior and your attitude.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.963
- Yes, ma'am.
- Smoke?

07:43.464 --> 07:44.506
Yes.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.343
I see in your file
that your father's your legal guardian.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.054
How's he feel about you being here?

07:51.680 --> 07:52.639
He doesn't care.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.349
We don't like each other much.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.642
Why not?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.728
When my mom died,
he said I could come live with him

07:58.061 --> 07:59.646
so I wouldn't have to live
in a foster home.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.023
You didn't get along?

08:01.356 --> 08:04.026
Well, he liked me a lot at first,
when I was little.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.819
What happened?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.864
As I got older, I made him stop.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.824
Stop?

08:11.158 --> 08:12.993
Liking me so much.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.579
- You mean he molested you?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.248
- Didn't you ever tell anybody?
- I was too scared.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.335
I just made sure he stayed away
when I got older.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.963
I learned to handle myself okay.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.467
Not well enough.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.093
You're here.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.722
I think you're gonna do just fine, Jenny.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.266
You're new here and so am I.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.268
I hope you and the other girls
will come to me,

08:38.602 --> 08:40.020
tell me what it's like in here.

08:40.354 --> 08:44.358
I'll listen and I'll work with you
to make it as easy as I can.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.027
- Got a deal?
- It's a deal.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.371
Hey, told that Norton dame about us.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.331
She said we were okay.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.375
If we bunk together,
will you be my friend?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.794
I already am.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.764
Vote's in.
Here's the new shipment.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.853
I thought I smelled fish.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.650
Welcome to our country club, ladies.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.194
This is the last stop on your tour.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.365
Home, you might call it.

09:35.242 --> 09:41.164
Nicky, I see that flip tongue of yours
didn't get you so far on the outside.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.126
Outsmarted yourself again, didn't you?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.421
Who's your new friend?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.715
This here's Kelly.
She's with me.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.341
She's okay.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.510
I'm sure she is.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.388
Too bad the two of you
won't be bunking together.

09:56.722 --> 10:00.309
Take these three to number 17.
These three bunk here.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.561
Dr. Norton said we could bunk together.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.354
She said we was okay.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.773
Norton don't make the rules.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.068
I do.
You should know that by now, dear.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.112
She ain't never been in here before.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.906
She needs me to help her make it.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.951
Everyone's a first-timer once.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.244
Get her out of here.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.163
- Okay, come on girls. Come on.
- Nicky, I don't want to go.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.249
- I don't want to go.
- You know the routine, Nicky.

10:29.338 --> 10:33.592
Jennifer Williams, Lisa Stewart,
and of course, Nicky.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.597
You may be numbers to all the rest,
but not to me.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.433
You do things right, and we'll get along.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.394
I run a good, tight dorm.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.229
Right, Nicky?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.732
The only thing tight about you
are your pants.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.779
I'll remember that remark.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.781
I'm the head matron here.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.950
You answer to me on every count.

10:59.284 --> 11:03.413
My name's Edna, but some of the girls
call me Eddie

11:04.373 --> 11:06.166
after they get to know me better.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.293
I like that.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.129
You might like it, too, after a while.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.222
I expect full cooperation.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.351
- That doll, I got to take it.
- No.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.311
- We got rules.
- Can't she keep it?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.814
- It's real important to her.
- Speaking out of turn?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.233
Did you hear
what I said about cooperation?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.151
The nurses said she could keep it.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.986
Oh, I'm impressed.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.163
It'll be safe with me.

11:46.748 --> 11:51.128
You want to see it from time to time,
you just ask me nicely.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.134
Now, let's go to the dorm.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.304
- Anyway, I called her.
- Give it back.

12:32.794 --> 12:38.091
Come out, sweethearts. Come out.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.724
There are three empties down back.

12:46.057 --> 12:51.897
You take 17, and you 19,
and you get the upper, number 20.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.191
Dinner in an hour.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.588
- I can fix it for you.
- Come on, over here.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.590
All right, you mug.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.135
Just because you've been here longer,
don't mean you're getting out sooner.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.240
Lisa, Edna told you to take 17.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.493
- Seventeen's taken, fish bait.
- Yes.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.745
Well, Edna just told her to take it.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.121
Whoa.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.124
- Listen, sister.
- Thanks, but I'm not your sister.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.335
It's okay, Jenny.
I don't mind.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.920
You should mind.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.755
You heard what Edna said about the rules.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.799
- The rules?
- How about if I just move your stuff

14:01.132 --> 14:02.634
- to the upper?
- Later, baby cake.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.720
How about if I move your ass
across the floor?

14:06.054 --> 14:08.974
Bullseye booked
for child molesting, film at 11.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.644
- Let it rest, Jenny.
- "Let it rest, Jenny."

14:13.019 --> 14:14.688
Your friend has the right idea.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.774
My friend may be afraid of you,
but I'm not.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.152
- Whoa.
- I said lay off it, sister.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.618
- Come on.
- Give it to her.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.661
- Break it up.
- Come on, come on, come on.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.997
I see you're going to have
a hard time adjusting.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.540
I was adjusting.

15:15.874 --> 15:19.878
Don't you contradict me,
you insolent bitch.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.422
Stirring the shit already, huh?

15:23.548 --> 15:24.925
What happened, Charlie?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.552
She was throwing my personals around.

15:27.844 --> 15:28.970
Yes, that's right.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.389
Girl ain't got much on the inside.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.892
What little she does have is personal.

15:35.226 --> 15:39.272
Messing with another girl's personals
is against the rules.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.691
You just lost one privilege.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.278
- But she --
- Speaking out of turn is another rule.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.572
Want to lose two privileges?

15:49.866 --> 15:56.122
The name of the game, ladies,
is control. Complete control.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.044
- Everyone into your bunks until dinner.
- Oh, no.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.296
Thanks. A lot of thanks.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.340
You did this, you know?

16:54.472 --> 16:55.682
Silence.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.312
Fishlips and rice.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.981
It must be Wednesday.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.114
I guess some people order
from a different menu.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.041
Hey, Charlie, looks like
the rookie's giving you the eye.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.423
Don't cost nothing to look.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.092
I don't know about that.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.595
Give me the box lunch.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.809
Don't bust your straps yet, Knox.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.936
You'll get yours in the end.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.817
- No.
- You lost one privilege.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.903
I decided it's dinner.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.113
Let's go, get up.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.520
I like the way you took on Charlie today.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.980
Ain't many fish that would fuck with Char.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.524
I didn't know who I was messing with.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.110
It seems like Charlie and Edna
have an understanding.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.654
Yeah, Charlie is under
and Edna is standing.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.990
My name is Paula.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.826
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.744
- This is Lisa.
- Hi, Lisa.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.329
Hi.

18:42.413 --> 18:46.918
Here, stay cool. You're okay.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.505
That's Claudia, poor sucker.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.716
- What happened to her?
- She blocked out last month.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.052
- Blocked out?
- Yes, but they caught her

18:56.386 --> 18:58.179
and flipped her back in,
and now she get to do her time

18:58.513 --> 19:01.057
- all over again.
- You asshole.

19:08.606 --> 19:14.154
You know, we got off to a bad start,
but now that Edna evened the score,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.030
maybe we can start fresh.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.074
My name is Charlie.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.785
- I know who you are.
- These here are my girls.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.164
You call them girls? Hey.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.958
Still going to play it cool, huh?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.252
I'm not going to play at all.

19:29.586 --> 19:34.174
Listen, snob, you better learn real fast
about life behind the iron here,

19:34.507 --> 19:37.010
because it's real important
who you move with.

19:40.889 --> 19:45.518
Things would be real easy for you
if you and your friend would decide

19:45.852 --> 19:47.937
to fall in with me and my girls.

19:48.271 --> 19:52.650
The proud crowd, huh? Thanks.
I pick my own friends.

19:54.027 --> 20:00.909
Might I remind you that your friend
is the local scum sucker around here.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.578
And you ain't as Dutch blood,
you motherfucking dyke.

20:03.912 --> 20:06.247
Take that back
if you ever want to talk again.

20:06.581 --> 20:10.335
You take that back if you ever want
to wag that tongue of yours again.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.378
Stop it.
Let her alone.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.007
- Do it.
- Open up. Open up.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.509
- Stop.
- Open up.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.889
Hey, ditch it, you guys.
Big pig's coming.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.474
It's lights out.

20:26.935 --> 20:30.146
- This ain't settled yet, white bread.
- Bet your ass it ain't.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.830
Count down. All right?

20:48.414 --> 20:50.291
Let's play the name game.

20:50.625 --> 20:51.876
- Charmin, Karen.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.920
- Eldrige, Andrea.
- Stewart, Lisa.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.505
- Locke, Becky.
- Chambliss, Charlie.

20:55.838 --> 20:56.923
Williams, Jennifer.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.425
- Adam, Nicky.
- Belgrave, Nina.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.301
- Johnson, Paula.
- Lawson, Claudia.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.553
- Eileen, Terry.
- Gabriel, Terry.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.268
Lights out.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.228
No talking.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.489
Remember,
keep your fingers above the sheets.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.450
We only change them once a week.

21:32.208 --> 21:36.212
Mother of salvation, shrine of holiness
and mercy,

21:36.546 --> 21:40.466
I long to come before you in my misery,
sick with corruption,

21:40.883 --> 21:45.471
in pain from the wounds of crimes,
putrid with the sores of sin.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.850
I am so filthy and disgusting
that I am afraid

21:49.183 --> 21:50.768
you will turn your back on me.

21:51.436 --> 21:57.775
Hear me, good lady, and I bless the soul
of the sinner who is contrite. Amen.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.280
Hey, watch it.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.205
Hey, morning will be here quicker
than you think.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.000
I can never sleep in a strange bed.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.753
Don't think of it as strange.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.880
I decided I'm going to think of this
as summer camp

22:19.213 --> 22:21.173
and we'll be going home soon.
- Shhh.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.384
Hey, knock it off down there, you two.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.803
You want Miss Dread back up here again?

24:33.055 --> 24:35.766
- What is it?
- Lisa?

24:36.100 --> 24:37.810
Oh, my god, it's Lisa.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.896
Don't get yourself into it, god damn it.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.064
- She's so weak.
- You can't.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.483
Let me go.

24:44.442 --> 24:47.487
- Halt right there, young lady.
- What are they doing to her?

24:58.748 --> 25:02.293
You little brat,
you're as heavy as lead. Come on.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.009
Seems like you new girls are having
some trouble getting adjusted.

25:10.551 --> 25:14.931
I know I have a beautiful voice,
but I don't make these rules

25:15.264 --> 25:17.058
to hear myself talk.

25:17.433 --> 25:24.232
So far today, it's been two girls
and two infractions, and that's too much.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.610
You'll all be written up
and confined tomorrow

25:27.944 --> 25:30.488
if there's any more trouble
from this group.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.698
Take care of your friend.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.910
She just had a little accident.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.788
Oh, come on, man.

26:13.698 --> 26:16.117
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.994
Charlie's got your number.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.997
I wouldn't leave myself out
in the open too much if I were you.

26:21.330 --> 26:25.501
Thanks,
and thanks for the bread last night.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.628
- It helped.
- My pleasure.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.219
What are those marks?

26:41.475 --> 26:43.311
I don't see no marks.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.229
Those marks on those girls.

26:45.563 --> 26:49.692
I said, I don't see no marks,
and neither do you.

26:59.410 --> 27:00.870
Your friend Lisa still out?

27:01.203 --> 27:01.996
Yeah.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.332
She's in the infirmary,
threw up all night.

27:17.637 --> 27:22.850
You butthole sisters
better wash your things real good,

27:23.184 --> 27:27.605
because we don't want
none of your crotch rot in our dorm.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.116
- Hey.
- Shine it on.

27:40.743 --> 27:44.497
I want to see that honkey bitch get hers
before I bop out of this place.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.042
It's coming.
Baby, it's coming.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.634
I see from your report
you've listed all of Lisa's infractions,

27:56.967 --> 28:00.721
but you've made no attempt to indicate
what might've provoked her behavior.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.265
Troublemaker's a troublemaker.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.811
All these girls are here
because they broke the rules.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.022
It's not my job to find out why.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.275
I'm here to see they don't break anymore.

28:13.609 --> 28:14.944
I see.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.616
Well,
perhaps I'd better speak to Lisa alone.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.660
Suit yourself.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.079
I'm missing my breakfast, anyway.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.428
You don't like Edna, do you, Lisa?

28:41.971 --> 28:44.265
Do you know what "don't make waves" means?

28:46.559 --> 28:51.230
Lisa, all the girls have it hard
on the inside,

28:52.314 --> 28:53.733
but you've got to go with the flow.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.359
Don't make waves.

28:55.693 --> 28:59.238
Don't push too hard, and your time
will go much easier.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.577
I can't breathe.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.665
When I'm locked up, I can't breathe.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.878
Please, will you help me?

29:14.211 --> 29:16.547
You can help me.
I didn't want to come here.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.674
I only ran away.
I didn't want to be here.

29:19.008 --> 29:22.678
It doesn't have to be so frightening.
We're all on the inside.

29:23.012 --> 29:25.139
But you're not locked up.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.475
You can leave.
I was always locked up.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.602
Me and Joey locked up in the dark.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.104
I'm going to die if I stay here.
Joey died.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.398
You're not going to die.
Now, do you understand me?

29:34.732 --> 29:36.609
You're not going to die.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.612
Now, who's Joey?
How did he die?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.324
My brother.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.327
He died in the hotbox.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.120
We were locked up.

29:48.704 --> 29:49.455
Hotbox?

29:51.040 --> 29:52.541
What is it, Lisa?

29:53.793 --> 29:55.419
Old icebox in the garage.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.507
She always locked us in there
when we were bad.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.258
Who did this to you?

30:01.967 --> 30:03.177
Foster mother.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.807
She always locked us in there
when we were bad, to punish us.

30:08.933 --> 30:09.892
Oh, my God.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.186
One time, she locked us both in there.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.650
It was hot, and it was crowded,
and there wasn't enough air,

30:19.944 --> 30:25.658
and Joey started to sweat,
and then he was choking,

30:27.284 --> 30:30.788
and I tried not to breathe,
I tried not to breathe.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.332
I didn't want to take his air,
and then I started.

30:33.666 --> 30:34.625
I pounded on the door.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.628
I pounded on the door,
but she didn't hear me.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.964
It's not your fault, Lisa.

30:40.548 --> 30:43.175
You didn't have anything to do
with his dying.

30:44.301 --> 30:45.636
They took him away.

30:46.971 --> 30:51.141
They took all his things away
and I kept his bunny.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.730
Joey's gone, but I only kept his bunny.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.024
I need it to sleep.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.193
Is that why you left the dorm last night?

31:03.779 --> 31:04.989
To get the bunny.

31:07.283 --> 31:08.450
It was in the drawer.

31:08.784 --> 31:12.413
It was locked up and it was dark,

31:12.746 --> 31:15.749
and I started to think about Joey,

31:16.083 --> 31:18.836
and I couldn't breathe.

31:41.191 --> 31:44.153
She says if I don't side with her,
I've had it.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.405
You don't side with nobody, understand?

31:47.489 --> 31:50.075
Now, you point her out to me
and I'll straighten her out.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.786
She's over there.
Her name's Stella.

31:58.459 --> 32:00.836
I remember the first time
I stood by that fence.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.880
I thought of a hundred ways to get over.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.465
Doesn't look too difficult.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.467
I could get over it in one try.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.052
Shoot, we could all flop over.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.345
For what?

32:09.678 --> 32:12.097
You got no money, no clothes,
nowhere to go.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.642
Less than a week, they'd flip you back
in here and you'd have to put up

32:14.975 --> 32:16.727
with even harder shit.

32:17.061 --> 32:18.812
Where are those lucky stiffs going?

32:19.146 --> 32:22.691
Them?
They got wetback work. Hard labor.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.694
You'll find out soon enough.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.286
- Fight, fight, fight.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.330
- You don't call them anymore.
- Lay off.

32:36.664 --> 32:40.292
Look, in my dorm, I do the picking
for who I lay off and who I lay on.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.379
Come on, let's --

32:55.516 --> 32:59.228
My eyes! Oh, they're burning!

32:59.561 --> 33:01.063
Somebody help me, my eyes!

33:03.440 --> 33:05.859
- Get out.
- Let her bunk with me.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.903
You've got to tell Edna
to let her bunk with me.

33:08.237 --> 33:11.073
Get these two to Sutter's office.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.076
The rest of you better break it up,
or you're all on report.

33:20.624 --> 33:21.917
Get out of here.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.184
Save some bread for Nicky.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.860
Stella's missing dinner
on account of you.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.113
She told me to give you her milk.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.159
What's the matter?

33:55.492 --> 34:00.497
Ain't you hungry?

34:00.831 --> 34:02.499
Hold your spoons.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.585
On your feet.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.772
- Be seated.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.193
Hold your tongues.

34:31.528 --> 34:35.365
I'm here to address the commotion
that took place in the machine shop

34:35.699 --> 34:36.784
this afternoon.

34:37.117 --> 34:40.579
As you know, the two wild cats
are in their cages tonight.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.207
You're lucky you're not with them.

34:43.957 --> 34:49.838
Rules are rules, and anyone
not adjusting to these rules

34:50.714 --> 34:52.966
is going to be a sorry young lady.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.386
In the words of Saint Joan at the stake --

35:03.143 --> 35:05.145
I was about to quote Saint Joan.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.356
Just before she fried --

35:48.814 --> 35:51.942
I want this bullshit stopped
and I want it stopped now.

35:52.276 --> 35:54.486
You're losing your charisma, Edna.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.904
You're too easy.

35:56.238 --> 35:58.240
It's time you put on your "fuck you" boots
and start kicking.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.951
My girls won't step out of line anymore,
Sutter.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.828
I promise you that.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.872
Or else.

37:03.222 --> 37:05.390
Well, that Norton dame sure
kept her promise

37:05.724 --> 37:08.101
about making it easy for us on the inside.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.979
- This isn't her fault.
- Oh, don't kid yourself.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.356
She's one of them.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.359
On the inside, it's either them or us.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.362
I don't think Norton
even knows we're out here.

37:18.695 --> 37:21.240
She knows we're out here.
She don't give a flying fuck.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.994
I guess this means
the end of my manicure.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.586
Hey, where you think you're going?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.797
I need some water.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.548
You crazy, girl?

37:39.383 --> 37:40.509
Get back in line.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.219
I didn't call break.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.304
Please, I have to have some water.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.391
- Lisa, don't.
- I said get back in line.

37:47.724 --> 37:50.352
- What's going on here?
- She says she needs a drink.

37:50.686 --> 37:53.605
Get back to work.
No drink until lunch.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.858
You all had your chance
for a drink last night in mess hall,

37:57.192 --> 37:59.194
but you all thought you'd be cute.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.072
Now you can pay for your shenanigans.

38:02.406 --> 38:05.158
You know the name of the game, girls.

38:06.243 --> 38:09.204
All right, show's over.
Back to work.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.507
Hang in there, kid.
It's only a few more minutes to lunch.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.183
- Lisa?
- Shit, the kid's out.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.185
- Lisa?
- Okay, get back.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.521
Get back, it's just the sun.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.190
Put her in the back of the truck
and get her some water.

38:37.524 --> 38:40.152
The rest of you, get back to work.

38:40.944 --> 38:45.407
I said, back to work or no meal.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.968
All right, lunch.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.429
Line up. Ten minutes.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.598
Another day of this
and I'm going to fold.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.225
Don't think about it.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.852
That's what they want,
it's how they control us.

39:56.186 --> 39:58.605
Besides, I hate discussing business
at lunch.

40:01.775 --> 40:02.818
Hey, look at that.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.447
Come here.

40:11.201 --> 40:13.537
Holy shit, it must be a wild one.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.497
It's lucky to be on the outside.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.708
Hey,
you think we can keep it? Like a mascot?

40:19.126 --> 40:20.544
Yeah, we can have a dorm pet.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.629
We can have Edna on our asses, too.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.506
It'll die out here if we don't feed it.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.551
The last thing we need around the dorm
is another pussy.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.511
Oh, no.

40:29.845 --> 40:33.515
- Ditch the cat.
- Here comes the guard.

40:42.149 --> 40:43.567
Aw, he's so cute.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.611
Let me hold him.
Come on, let me hold him.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.113
Yeah, kitty!

40:58.331 --> 41:00.917
Thought you'd like to have him,
Lisa. He's kind of cute, like your bunny.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.295
He has such a good appetite.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.755
I think I'll call him Bunny.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.133
You think when that psycho grows up,
it'll catch rats?

41:08.467 --> 41:11.470
Ain't nothin' big enough
to catch Edna's ass.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.556
Ain't Edna's ass it'll catch
if they find out we've got

41:14.890 --> 41:16.183
that animal in here.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.855
But they ain't gonna find out,
are they, Charlie?

41:24.441 --> 41:25.734
Aw, Charlie.

41:27.194 --> 41:28.445
Listen, you know the rules.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.697
I'm sick of this hard labor shit.

41:31.031 --> 41:34.242
Well, there's going to be some hard shit
come down on anybody that blows it

41:34.576 --> 41:37.120
about this kitten. Understand?

41:37.454 --> 41:40.582
- We'll see about that.
- Yes, we will.

41:41.666 --> 41:45.420
All right. Line up! Countdown.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.090
- Forget about it. Move.
- Let it be.

41:51.218 --> 41:52.677
Get up here.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.940
All right.
Let's play the name game.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.358
Charmin, Karen.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.944
- Eldrige, Andrea.
- Stewart, Lisa.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.529
Chambliss, Charlie.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.113
Williams, Jennifer.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.783
- Adams, Nicky.
- Lawson, Claudia.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.492
Harlen, Terry.

42:16.826 --> 42:19.412
- Kline, Francine.

42:19.746 --> 42:24.376
All right, lights out. No talking.

42:59.035 --> 43:00.287
Hey, Jenny?

43:00.704 --> 43:02.998
Think it's okay if I call him Joey
instead of Bunny?

43:03.331 --> 43:04.541
I think it's fine.

43:16.595 --> 43:20.890
Women of Pridemore,
let us reflect on these profound words.

43:21.391 --> 43:24.686
Wretched little woman,
you've grieved God very much.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.981
Arouse your mind,
look inward upon your soul,

43:28.315 --> 43:31.276
and beg forgiveness
for your undeserving wretchedness.

43:32.068 --> 43:35.572
Sinful whore, cleanse your sinful soul

43:35.989 --> 43:39.409
in the blood of the true redeemer. Amen.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.621
Beautiful, just beautiful.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.457
You've got two minutes.

43:46.750 --> 43:51.296
My grievances, Warden Sutter,
concern the medieval treatment

43:51.630 --> 43:53.632
of the girls at the hands of this woman.

43:54.049 --> 43:56.092
Lisa Stewart was brought
to the infirmary today,

43:56.426 --> 43:59.220
suffering from heat exhaustion.
Jennifer Williams told me

43:59.554 --> 44:01.097
she was refused water.

44:01.431 --> 44:03.475
What'd you serve the girls for lunch?

44:04.726 --> 44:06.561
- I don't recall.
- I'll tell you.

44:06.936 --> 44:08.229
Bread and water.

44:09.064 --> 44:11.858
A treatment that went out
with whips and chains.

44:12.317 --> 44:13.652
It was hot out there.

44:14.235 --> 44:17.656
- Anything else would've perished.
- Including the girls?

44:18.823 --> 44:21.493
My god, Warden, open your eyes.

44:21.951 --> 44:25.789
This woman is conducting a personal reign
of terror at your institution.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.666
She is out of control.

44:28.041 --> 44:31.086
She is control and I am the power.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.673
There's no making without breaking.

44:36.257 --> 44:41.513
Miss Dawson, I am fully aware
of the importance of discipline.

44:41.846 --> 44:46.017
What I am concerned about
is your system of favoritism.

44:46.309 --> 44:48.520
Specifically, Charlie and her girls.

44:49.229 --> 44:51.815
Just rewarding those
who are making progress.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.694
I would hardly call Charlie
a model of reform.

44:56.236 --> 44:58.405
There's something going on
between the two of you.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.949
I don't know what it is,
but it's perverse.

45:01.282 --> 45:02.492
Enough.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.537
You're wasting my time
with your petty squabbles.

45:05.954 --> 45:07.372
Oh, excuse me.

45:07.956 --> 45:09.749
I wouldn't want to waste your time.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.002
I'll just file my report to the commission
and see what they have to say

45:13.336 --> 45:14.462
about all this.

45:17.674 --> 45:19.592
I knew that one was going to be trouble.

45:19.926 --> 45:23.138
Don't worry.
That report will never pass my desk.

45:25.974 --> 45:27.726
I can spike that report.

45:31.730 --> 45:33.940
Make sure
you take care of that Williams girl.

45:45.410 --> 45:46.536
It's that time.

45:46.870 --> 45:50.790
Oh, no.
Leave me alone.

45:58.131 --> 46:00.216
Get her over here and keep her quiet.

46:09.642 --> 46:13.480
I told you I wanted you to be
one of my girls when you first came here,

46:13.813 --> 46:16.441
and you had to fall in
with that asshole, Jenny,

46:16.775 --> 46:18.443
and her wimpy friends.

46:18.777 --> 46:22.614
Well, after this,
everyone will know you're mine.

46:29.996 --> 46:32.499
Hey, shut that cat up,
or we're all going to get fried.

46:34.751 --> 46:35.960
Lisa?

46:45.053 --> 46:46.304
Where are you?

46:47.847 --> 46:50.391
This is going to hurt you
more than it hurts me.

46:50.725 --> 46:51.976
Drop it, Charlie.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.939
I will when I'm finished.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.191
Nicky, call for help.

47:00.235 --> 47:06.074
Get her, Charlie, come on.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.263
Christ almighty,
I can't believe it.

47:28.596 --> 47:31.641
It was her.
She tried to burn me!

47:32.058 --> 47:33.935
Listen to her, god damn it.

47:35.270 --> 47:39.732
Don't you ever talk to me that way again,
any of you.

47:40.525 --> 47:43.695
One more word
and your time is all doubled.

47:45.446 --> 47:48.533
I've had enough of you, you little slut.

47:48.908 --> 47:52.120
Seems like you can't get along
with people too well.

47:52.620 --> 47:55.748
Well, I'll just have to put you
where you won't bother anybody

47:56.082 --> 47:58.668
and Nobody'll bother you, honey.

48:00.003 --> 48:01.379
Please.

48:07.385 --> 48:08.720
No!

48:09.220 --> 48:12.056
Please, please, no!

48:16.895 --> 48:21.691
Please don't put me --
no, I'll do anything, please.

48:22.025 --> 48:26.070
We'll put you away, and when I want you,
I'll know just where to find you.

48:26.404 --> 48:29.115
No, no, please!

48:33.202 --> 48:38.041
Let me out!
I can't breathe! Please! Please!

48:47.467 --> 48:49.093
Lisa's getting out of the hole tonight.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.678
Bet she'll be stir bug.

48:51.012 --> 48:52.931
These bastards have no soul.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.146
Hey, look at that.

49:09.864 --> 49:12.700
I ain't leaving this place
until I see that cunt get hers.

49:13.034 --> 49:14.786
Cunt's getting hers right now.

49:15.119 --> 49:16.245
Yeah, the big jelly roll.

49:16.579 --> 49:17.872
Please, don't say, "jelly roll,"

49:18.206 --> 49:19.540
I am so hungry.

49:41.813 --> 49:43.189
Watch your ass, kid.

49:43.523 --> 49:45.191
Make 'em pay, that's what I say.

49:45.525 --> 49:48.277
For a good, hard cucumber?
I'd give it away.

49:48.611 --> 49:50.405
Please, don't say "cucumber."

49:52.740 --> 49:55.034
How come that guy doesn't wear a uniform?
- He ain't no guard.

49:55.368 --> 49:58.371
- He hired help, honey.
- Does he live on the grounds?

49:58.705 --> 49:59.789
I don't think so.

50:00.123 --> 50:02.125
He leaves the camp every night
after lights out.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.335
What about the truck?

50:04.669 --> 50:07.422
Takes it with him,
don't come back 'til nine in the morning.

50:20.768 --> 50:22.645
Lunch. Ten minutes.

50:34.157 --> 50:37.994
No food and no water.

50:38.327 --> 50:41.039
I'm putting you on the Pridemore diet.

50:41.539 --> 50:42.999
Back to work.

50:45.209 --> 50:50.131
And if any of the rest of you got
any bright ideas about talking to Norton,

50:50.965 --> 50:52.341
better think twice.

50:55.845 --> 50:57.096
All right, move it.

50:57.430 --> 50:58.765
This ain't no company picnic.

50:59.098 --> 51:01.142
No shit, Sherlock.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.656
Jenny!

51:18.076 --> 51:19.202
Guards!

51:20.828 --> 51:23.039
Get back!
Get back there!

51:23.372 --> 51:24.791
Put her on the truck.

51:30.838 --> 51:34.634
And not a word to anyone, understand?

51:40.681 --> 51:41.849
Pass it over here.

52:54.005 --> 53:00.344
Oh! My stomach!

53:00.678 --> 53:07.143
Oh, my stomach!

53:12.732 --> 53:14.025
What's going on?

53:14.358 --> 53:17.904
Oh, my stomach!

53:24.869 --> 53:27.288
Come on,
you ain't going to die.

53:27.622 --> 53:31.709
Straighten up, straighten up. Up, damn it.

53:32.043 --> 53:34.545
Oh, my stomach hurts, too.

53:34.879 --> 53:37.882
Oh, my stomach.

53:38.216 --> 53:39.717
- Mine, too.
- Mine hurts, too.

53:43.679 --> 53:44.931
Poison.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.350
Let me feel your forehead.

53:50.603 --> 53:53.231
Oh, I'm dying.

53:54.106 --> 53:55.775
Give me that bucket.

53:58.486 --> 54:00.154
Oh, my stomach.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.367
Call the doctor.
Get that stomach pump immediately.

54:07.662 --> 54:09.372
I could fucking die right here.

54:09.705 --> 54:12.083
Don't worry,
you didn't eat no poison food.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.793
No, Charlie.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.587
I really think
I'm going to toss my cookies.

54:17.964 --> 54:20.758
It's a gag, I'm telling you.
Jenny just flopped out.

54:22.009 --> 54:23.427
You're shitting me.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.766
Don't worry,
she won't be going far.

55:15.104 --> 55:16.147
Hop in.

55:23.863 --> 55:25.031
Park it, why don't you?

55:47.845 --> 55:49.513
I've never done it in a truck before.

55:49.847 --> 55:53.809
I've done it plenty.
Drink?

56:07.907 --> 56:10.868
I bet there's a motel nearby,
don't you think?

56:11.202 --> 56:14.622
Yeah, there's about a dozen out
on the highway. Why?

56:15.664 --> 56:18.709
I could make you feel real good
in one of the motel beds.

56:20.378 --> 56:22.713
I can make you feel real good right here.

56:31.889 --> 56:33.224
Let's play carnival.

56:35.476 --> 56:36.685
What's that?

56:39.897 --> 56:42.858
You sit on my face
and I'll guess your weight.

56:54.036 --> 56:55.371
Stick your tongue out.

57:22.773 --> 57:25.568
These cramps go and come rather suddenly.

57:25.901 --> 57:27.027
It's their age.

57:27.403 --> 57:28.737
Could be menstrual.

57:29.113 --> 57:31.365
You don't think it was the food,
do you, doctor?

57:31.699 --> 57:33.576
The foods bad, Edna, but not that bad.

57:49.049 --> 57:50.551
Come on, get that dress off.

57:50.885 --> 57:52.428
We ain't got much time.

57:53.762 --> 57:55.347
What's the matter?

57:57.433 --> 57:58.976
I can't get back in the dorm.

58:00.394 --> 58:01.562
You'll take me with you.

58:03.731 --> 58:05.149
You think I wouldn't?

58:09.445 --> 58:11.280
Will you let me stay in the truck?

58:13.157 --> 58:14.533
Will you take me far?

58:15.784 --> 58:17.244
To the end of the line.

59:09.421 --> 59:10.505
Atta go, girl.

59:20.516 --> 59:21.767
Long night?

59:24.103 --> 59:25.604
Yeah, had to make a deposit.

59:25.938 --> 59:27.147
It's all clear.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.277
I got something for you in the back.

59:41.453 --> 59:43.205
End of the line, sister.

59:43.539 --> 59:45.833
- No!
- Hold it!

59:46.166 --> 59:48.627
- Where the hell you think you're going?
- You lying fucking bastard!

59:48.961 --> 59:50.713
Come here, sister!

1:00:53.692 --> 1:00:56.362
Time flies when you're having fun.

1:00:56.862 --> 1:00:58.155
Time's doubled.

1:00:58.530 --> 1:01:00.449
Put it on her record.

1:01:20.844 --> 1:01:21.929
What's the hurry?

1:01:22.262 --> 1:01:25.557
We got nothing to do until dinner.

1:01:28.727 --> 1:01:31.605
I think it's time for a little initiation.

1:01:31.939 --> 1:01:33.107
What do you think, girls?

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:34.733
I think so.

1:01:35.067 --> 1:01:39.363
Don't have that bitch here
to protect you anymore, do you, Lisa?

1:01:39.697 --> 1:01:42.658
You don't need no protection,
do you, Lisa?

1:01:42.991 --> 1:01:45.035
We're not going to hurt you too much.

1:01:45.369 --> 1:01:49.123
Maybe a little at first,
and then you'll see how good it is,

1:01:49.456 --> 1:01:51.375
being one of my girls.

1:01:51.709 --> 1:01:55.379
Being one of my girls is good,
gets you special favors

1:01:55.713 --> 1:01:57.798
and keeps the others away.

1:01:58.132 --> 1:02:00.259
It's kind of like a special club.

1:02:04.263 --> 1:02:05.347
What's the matter?

1:02:05.723 --> 1:02:07.641
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah, what's the matter?

1:02:07.975 --> 1:02:09.643
Don't you like it?

1:02:10.352 --> 1:02:13.147
I bet you wish I was a guy, don't you?

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:14.815
Don't worry about that, though.

1:02:15.149 --> 1:02:17.317
You stay in here long enough,
and you won't even be thinking

1:02:17.651 --> 1:02:19.069
about guys anymore.

1:02:19.611 --> 1:02:21.989
Here, you kinda get out of the habit.

1:02:22.322 --> 1:02:24.366
I'm all the stud you need.

1:02:29.747 --> 1:02:30.664
Where's Lisa?

1:02:30.998 --> 1:02:32.332
Let it go, Nicky.

1:02:32.666 --> 1:02:33.834
It's too late.

1:02:37.463 --> 1:02:38.881
Out of my way, Claudia.

1:02:39.214 --> 1:02:40.507
Forget it, Nicky.

1:02:41.216 --> 1:02:43.510
Charlie wants this one real bad.

1:02:43.844 --> 1:02:46.346
We've got enough problems in this dorm.

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:47.848
It ain't our fight no more.

1:02:48.182 --> 1:02:49.600
God damn it, she's just a kid.

1:02:49.933 --> 1:02:52.019
- She's helpless.
- That's right.

1:02:52.352 --> 1:02:57.399
Maybe what she needs is what Charlie
can give her, some protection.

1:02:58.567 --> 1:03:00.444
Now, we take on Charlie, we take on Edna.

1:03:02.154 --> 1:03:03.363
Let her have the kid.

1:03:06.909 --> 1:03:08.202
Welcome to the club.

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:17.044
It's a perfect job.

1:03:32.267 --> 1:03:33.644
My God.

1:03:36.647 --> 1:03:39.900
Why is the condition of this girl so bad?

1:03:40.234 --> 1:03:43.362
It ain't easy to make yourself
pretty in the hole.

1:03:45.405 --> 1:03:49.034
Jenny, nobody even told me you were in
until this morning.

1:03:49.368 --> 1:03:51.662
God, Jenny, you look terrible.

1:03:51.995 --> 1:03:54.373
I'm fine.
Thanks for the water.

1:03:54.790 --> 1:03:57.000
You know, your time's been doubled.

1:03:57.334 --> 1:04:00.170
I can't believe it, Jenny.
You want to tell me what's happened?

1:04:00.504 --> 1:04:01.922
Isn't it there on my record?

1:04:02.256 --> 1:04:05.592
Their version is, but I want to hear
what you've got to say.

1:04:05.926 --> 1:04:07.469
Nothing I say counts.

1:04:07.803 --> 1:04:10.180
What you've got there in my file
is all that matters.

1:04:10.514 --> 1:04:12.766
Everything's done by the book, right, doc?

1:04:13.308 --> 1:04:15.435
I'm going to do something else
by the book, Jenny.

1:04:15.769 --> 1:04:18.480
I'm filing a report
to the Youth Authority Commission.

1:04:18.814 --> 1:04:22.693
Now, this could get serious.
Sutter will obviously oppose my position.

1:04:23.026 --> 1:04:24.236
I want you to testify.

1:04:24.570 --> 1:04:26.655
Tell how you
and the other girls are treated,

1:04:26.989 --> 1:04:29.241
how you've been abused here.

1:04:29.575 --> 1:04:31.076
I'm no pigeon.

1:04:31.618 --> 1:04:34.872
You think I'm going to stick my neck out
on the block so you can hand Edna the axe?

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:37.541
Jenny, I'll protect you.

1:04:37.875 --> 1:04:41.128
I won't let anything happen to you,
but I can't do it alone.

1:04:41.461 --> 1:04:46.466
I need positive evidence, solid testimony,
anything that'll help me present my case.

1:04:46.967 --> 1:04:49.344
Can't you see what I'm after, Jenny?

1:04:49.678 --> 1:04:50.554
Listen, doc.

1:04:50.888 --> 1:04:52.931
I know you mean well, but so far,
there's been a lot of talk

1:04:53.265 --> 1:04:54.266
and a lot of pain.

1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:57.644
The talk doesn't seem to change much,
but the pain sure makes you think.

1:04:58.854 --> 1:05:00.272
I'll see you around.

1:05:23.795 --> 1:05:26.131
Sure feels good to clean up
after two weeks in that hole.

1:05:26.465 --> 1:05:29.968
- How's it going for you, kid?
- Oh, I'm okay now.

1:05:30.510 --> 1:05:33.513
Nicky told me what happened.
Wouldn't have happened if I was here.

1:05:33.847 --> 1:05:35.599
I know, thanks.

1:05:36.725 --> 1:05:40.145
Hey, I heard number 11 had
a flop out last night.

1:05:40.729 --> 1:05:42.522
She got it worse than you.

1:05:42.856 --> 1:05:44.316
Two cut wrists going over the fence.

1:05:44.650 --> 1:05:46.652
What difference does it make?

1:05:46.985 --> 1:05:48.403
She was a wanker.

1:05:48.904 --> 1:05:50.864
You're all wankers.

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:54.493
This place was running smooth
until you ingrates

1:05:54.826 --> 1:05:56.703
started messing things up.

1:05:57.037 --> 1:06:02.459
This place ain't never run smooth
but for no one but you, Charlie.

1:06:02.793 --> 1:06:07.255
I'm through taking the hard labor shit
for you guys.

1:06:07.589 --> 1:06:09.299
We're through taking shit from Edna

1:06:09.633 --> 1:06:11.843
so you can get your way around here,
princess.

1:06:12.177 --> 1:06:15.138
Come on,
let's beat the shit out of each other.

1:06:15.472 --> 1:06:17.099
Your time's already doubled.

1:06:17.432 --> 1:06:19.768
Let's see if we can get it tripled.
Come on.

1:06:20.769 --> 1:06:23.522
She ain't worth getting busted over.

1:06:23.855 --> 1:06:26.233
You know Edna
won't take our side over hers. Come on.

1:06:28.318 --> 1:06:31.738
Line up. Countdown.

1:06:41.873 --> 1:06:43.125
All right.

1:06:43.458 --> 1:06:45.460
Let's play the name game.

1:06:45.794 --> 1:06:46.837
Charmin, Karen.

1:06:47.170 --> 1:06:48.171
Eldrige, Andrea.

1:06:48.505 --> 1:06:49.631
Stewart, Lisa.

1:06:49.965 --> 1:06:51.341
Chambliss, Charlie.

1:06:51.675 --> 1:06:52.634
Williams, Jennifer.

1:06:52.968 --> 1:06:54.261
Adams, Nicky.

1:07:19.411 --> 1:07:20.829
What the hell was that?

1:07:21.246 --> 1:07:23.415
No, no!

1:07:23.749 --> 1:07:26.251
- Give me that!
- No!

1:07:59.618 --> 1:08:04.623
Who dared to bring this animal in here?

1:08:05.082 --> 1:08:10.462
I said,
who dared to bring this animal in here?

1:08:14.883 --> 1:08:16.093
All right.

1:08:16.468 --> 1:08:18.053
Have it your own way.

1:08:18.678 --> 1:08:23.058
If I don't have the name of every girl
responsible for this by morning,

1:08:24.017 --> 1:08:25.644
you'll all pay.

1:08:28.647 --> 1:08:33.735
Just don't stand there,
bring me something to wipe my shoe.

1:09:07.519 --> 1:09:08.895
Oh, my God. Lisa.

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:10.856
Lisa? Where?

1:09:17.696 --> 1:09:19.865
Oh, my God, she's going to kill herself.

1:09:21.575 --> 1:09:23.160
You little bitch.

1:09:23.493 --> 1:09:25.954
You start trouble all the time.

1:09:26.288 --> 1:09:28.748
I'm going to really fuck with you.

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:38.133
Lisa!

1:09:38.592 --> 1:09:41.761
Not one more step, do you hear me?
Not one more step!

1:09:42.095 --> 1:09:43.972
Hold on, damn it.

1:09:46.683 --> 1:09:49.686
Not one more step.
Not one more step.

1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:54.983
You stop right there.

1:09:58.862 --> 1:10:01.573
I'm going to kill you
once I get my hands on you.

1:10:04.284 --> 1:10:06.036
You're going to pay for this, young lady.

1:10:06.369 --> 1:10:08.121
You're going to pay for this.

1:10:08.455 --> 1:10:10.207
Don't you dare move away from me.

1:10:16.171 --> 1:10:21.760
Oh, my God.

1:12:09.159 --> 1:12:11.286
Not one word.

1:12:11.911 --> 1:12:13.663
I'll get to the bottom of this setup.

1:12:14.039 --> 1:12:16.207
- You can be sure.
- Shut up.

1:12:17.125 --> 1:12:18.793
It was them.
They did it.

1:12:19.210 --> 1:12:20.837
Back in your cage.

1:12:21.379 --> 1:12:24.090
There's no sucking up to Edna this time.

1:12:25.467 --> 1:12:27.135
You. Look at you.

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:30.221
I thought you were going
to whip this place into shape.

1:12:30.972 --> 1:12:33.266
I should have known
I'd have to do it myself.

1:12:34.434 --> 1:12:36.561
- Your time is doubled.
- So's your chin.

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:38.063
Tripled.

1:12:38.396 --> 1:12:40.273
Who's dishing out the shit around here,
Edna?

1:12:40.607 --> 1:12:41.900
You were queen mother.

1:12:42.317 --> 1:12:45.403
Charlie, you're nothing but a stupid kid
from Cleveland,

1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:48.156
just a shit stain
on the panties of life.

1:12:48.531 --> 1:12:51.159
You should know,
you lick 'em every night.

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:54.412
No privileges until further notice,
and clean up this dump.

1:12:59.793 --> 1:13:01.252
Party's over, kid.

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:03.213
Take her away.

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:08.218
I'll piss on your grave, fuck!

1:13:14.599 --> 1:13:17.185
Two weeks in the hole wasn't enough,
I see.

1:13:17.644 --> 1:13:18.895
You fucking killer.

1:13:19.270 --> 1:13:20.939
Killer?

1:13:21.481 --> 1:13:24.317
You'll wish I had killed you
before I'm done.

1:13:32.075 --> 1:13:33.952
Get out of them clothes.

1:13:34.285 --> 1:13:35.912
Get them off, now.

1:13:37.330 --> 1:13:39.791
Get those clothes off.
Get them off.

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:53.430
Now, I know who was behind all of this,
but I want to hear it from you.

1:13:55.348 --> 1:14:00.645
I want the name of every girl
who took part in this tonight,

1:14:00.979 --> 1:14:03.440
and I want to hear you say it loud.

1:14:03.815 --> 1:14:08.236
No, no, no, no,

1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:14.242
no, no, no, no!

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:24.752
Say it, damn you. Say it.

1:14:28.089 --> 1:14:31.134
Say it, damn you. Say it.

1:14:31.468 --> 1:14:34.137
Say it, damn you. Say it.

1:14:34.471 --> 1:14:39.309
Say it! Say it, damn you! Say it!

1:14:39.976 --> 1:14:43.646
Damn you! Say it! Say it!

1:14:44.022 --> 1:14:47.066
Damn you! Say it!

1:14:49.444 --> 1:14:52.739
- What the hell is going on here, Sutter?
- What now?

1:14:53.198 --> 1:14:55.575
- I want answers and I want them fast.
- Whoa, there.

1:14:55.909 --> 1:14:57.827
No!
You "whoa," damn it.

1:14:58.244 --> 1:15:00.371
Now, I'm away from this place
for three days.

1:15:00.705 --> 1:15:05.043
One girl commits suicide,
two are in solitary, and a third
is unconscious

1:15:05.376 --> 1:15:07.420
in the infirmary, unable
to tell me what's happening.

1:15:07.754 --> 1:15:09.172
Now, I want answers.

1:15:09.714 --> 1:15:11.341
I don't take to threats.

1:15:11.674 --> 1:15:14.969
You'd better take to this one, Sutter,
because when I file my report

1:15:15.303 --> 1:15:16.930
to the youth commission,
you're going to be answering

1:15:17.263 --> 1:15:18.598
to more than just threats.

1:15:23.853 --> 1:15:25.146
Norton's history.

1:15:25.897 --> 1:15:28.024
I want her off the premises at once.

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:30.652
Give me the commission.

1:15:38.618 --> 1:15:40.370
Don't leave us now, doc.

1:15:41.079 --> 1:15:43.998
You were right,
we need your help. Lisa's dead.

1:15:44.415 --> 1:15:45.333
I know, dear.

1:15:45.667 --> 1:15:47.460
More of us are going to go
if you don't stick with it.

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:49.295
Oh, Jenny.

1:15:49.712 --> 1:15:53.633
It's just that I'm not sure what to do
or how to do it, anymore.

1:15:54.092 --> 1:15:56.719
The harder I try,
the worse it gets for you and the others.

1:15:57.095 --> 1:15:59.138
No doc, you can't give up.

1:15:59.973 --> 1:16:01.933
I was wrong and you were right.

1:16:02.517 --> 1:16:03.643
Tell me what to do.

1:16:04.143 --> 1:16:06.521
- I'll need you to testify.
- Okay.

1:16:06.896 --> 1:16:09.566
I'll need you and the others
to tell your story to the outside.

1:16:09.899 --> 1:16:10.942
It'll be tough.

1:16:11.317 --> 1:16:13.528
They'll say you're lying,
but I'll back you.

1:16:13.861 --> 1:16:16.698
I'll go to the DA, the press,
whatever it takes, Jenny.

1:16:17.031 --> 1:16:18.533
We'll beat them right here.

1:16:20.410 --> 1:16:23.037
Sorry, Dr. Norton. Orders.

1:16:24.414 --> 1:16:25.623
I'm leaving.

1:16:30.378 --> 1:16:31.963
We'll get 'em, doc.

1:16:38.803 --> 1:16:40.096
Child abuse.

1:16:41.472 --> 1:16:43.182
That bitch
hasn't heard the last of me yet.

1:16:43.516 --> 1:16:45.101
She can't make it stick.

1:16:45.476 --> 1:16:48.563
We'll just say it's sour grapes
over her being fired.

1:16:49.063 --> 1:16:51.232
The commission won't interfere here.

1:16:54.402 --> 1:16:59.407
Bringing shocking accusations of torture
and inhuman conditions

1:16:59.741 --> 1:17:05.330
at Pridemore Juvenile Facilities,
Dr. Norton claims to have a chief witness

1:17:06.205 --> 1:17:08.124
willing to testify at the hearing.

1:17:09.709 --> 1:17:11.044
You've got one week.

1:17:11.461 --> 1:17:12.754
Clear?

1:17:14.339 --> 1:17:15.548
Crystal clear.

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:33.650
You killer, you killer!

1:17:33.983 --> 1:17:35.777
You fucking murderer!

1:17:37.111 --> 1:17:38.446
Leave us alone.

1:18:20.113 --> 1:18:24.033
In light of the sensational circumstances
surrounding this case,

1:18:24.367 --> 1:18:27.328
I thought it best
to keep this hearing informal.

1:18:27.829 --> 1:18:29.414
And of course, private.

1:18:30.498 --> 1:18:34.252
I have reviewed your report, Dr. Norton,
and I must tell you

1:18:34.585 --> 1:18:37.880
that both the committee and myself
find it rather shocking

1:18:38.214 --> 1:18:39.966
and somewhat hard to believe.

1:18:41.217 --> 1:18:46.305
Warden Sutter also informed us
that you filed this report shortly

1:18:46.639 --> 1:18:50.184
after being dismissed of duty
at Pridemore Facilities.

1:18:50.727 --> 1:18:51.686
Is that correct?

1:18:52.019 --> 1:18:54.480
I assure you, your honor,
that I would not have made

1:18:54.814 --> 1:18:56.399
these accusations lightly.

1:18:56.733 --> 1:18:59.652
There are conditions and circumstances
at Pridemore

1:18:59.986 --> 1:19:02.113
which demand immediate attention.

1:19:02.572 --> 1:19:05.575
She just wants attention for herself,
your honor.

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:08.161
I challenge Ms. Dawson's remark,
your honor,

1:19:08.494 --> 1:19:11.497
and if we might bring in my witness,
she will enlighten you

1:19:11.831 --> 1:19:13.958
and the board members
as to the seriousness

1:19:14.292 --> 1:19:15.710
of these accusations.

1:19:16.043 --> 1:19:17.378
That would be Ms. Williams?

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.423
- Yes, your honor.
- Pardon me, your honor.

1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:22.717
Ms. Williams is unable to testify.

1:19:23.092 --> 1:19:24.302
What are you talking about?

1:19:24.761 --> 1:19:27.138
Where's Jenny?
What's happened to her?

1:19:27.638 --> 1:19:30.600
- She's not well.
- That is a lie.

1:19:30.933 --> 1:19:33.895
They are deliberately keeping the girl
away from testifying

1:19:34.228 --> 1:19:35.646
to protect themselves.

1:19:36.022 --> 1:19:39.108
Dr. Fisher examined the girl himself
this morning

1:19:39.442 --> 1:19:42.278
and said she was just too sick to leave.

1:19:43.112 --> 1:19:44.697
Dr. Fisher?

1:19:45.239 --> 1:19:47.241
Yes, your honor.
I examined the girl.

1:19:47.617 --> 1:19:49.911
She seemed a little weak,
almost delirious.

1:19:51.037 --> 1:19:52.705
Could be meningitis.

1:19:55.041 --> 1:19:58.586
However, your honor, present
are several girls from the same dorm.

1:19:58.961 --> 1:20:00.922
I'm sure you'll find them
just as cooperative.

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:40.586
Hey.

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:44.841
No. Guard, guard.

1:21:06.362 --> 1:21:08.656
Look, your honor,
we both love a good debate,

1:21:09.156 --> 1:21:11.033
but dinner's getting cold.
Let's wrap this up.

1:21:13.619 --> 1:21:14.912
Bring in the girls, please.

1:21:21.127 --> 1:21:22.628
Healthy girls, all.

1:21:25.464 --> 1:21:26.716
Good evening, young ladies.

1:21:27.049 --> 1:21:30.511
Now, I want you to understand
that this is just a simple meeting.

1:21:30.845 --> 1:21:34.015
No one is on trial and no one
is accused of anything.

1:21:34.390 --> 1:21:36.559
We simply want to ask you a few questions.

1:21:37.101 --> 1:21:38.519
Do you understand?

1:21:39.478 --> 1:21:40.730
Yes, sir.

1:21:41.564 --> 1:21:44.400
Dr. Norton here has made
some serious accusations

1:21:44.734 --> 1:21:47.737
concerning Matron Dawson
and the punishment she uses

1:21:48.070 --> 1:21:49.864
to discipline the girls in your dorm.

1:21:50.281 --> 1:21:52.658
Have any of you
ever been severely punished?

1:21:55.328 --> 1:21:58.080
- No, sir.
- No one ever been beaten?

1:21:59.749 --> 1:22:00.791
No, sir.

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:04.128
Any of you ever had meals taken away
or a fire hose turned on you?

1:22:05.504 --> 1:22:07.131
- No, sir.
- Stop it.

1:22:07.465 --> 1:22:08.966
Stop it for God's sake.

1:22:09.342 --> 1:22:10.885
Can't you see they're scared?

1:22:11.218 --> 1:22:12.803
They're not going to tell you anything.

1:22:13.137 --> 1:22:14.180
They're frightened.

1:22:14.555 --> 1:22:17.141
Frightened of her
and of what she'll do if they talk.

1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:18.893
Tell them.

1:22:19.226 --> 1:22:23.564
Don't let her get away with this.
Tell them. Don't be afraid.

1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:25.942
Dr. Norton, you're out of order.

1:23:03.062 --> 1:23:05.356
Take her out, Claudia. Get her!

1:23:05.690 --> 1:23:07.108
You and me going for a little walk, bitch.

1:23:07.441 --> 1:23:08.317
Kill the bitch.

1:23:08.651 --> 1:23:10.152
Hold it right there,
unless you want this pig dead.

1:23:10.486 --> 1:23:11.988
- You'll never get away with this.
- Maybe not.

1:23:12.321 --> 1:23:15.074
If we go, you go with us.
Now, let's get to that meeting.
Come on.

1:23:27.878 --> 1:23:30.047
Freeze! Freeze right there.

1:23:31.257 --> 1:23:33.759
Go ahead, use it.

1:23:34.093 --> 1:23:35.511
You can't stop us all.

1:23:35.845 --> 1:23:37.388
They're bluffing.

1:23:37.722 --> 1:23:40.057
Don't be afraid. Shoot.

1:23:43.310 --> 1:23:44.562
Shoot, I tell you.

1:23:47.148 --> 1:23:49.692
She goes before I go.

1:23:50.818 --> 1:23:52.445
See you later, pig.

1:23:52.778 --> 1:23:54.196
Come on, let's go.

1:24:13.340 --> 1:24:14.550
Edna!

1:24:14.925 --> 1:24:17.803
Edna!

1:24:18.304 --> 1:24:19.722
What the hell is that?

1:24:20.056 --> 1:24:21.599
- It's the riot alarm!
- Oh, my God.

1:24:24.101 --> 1:24:26.145
My God, it's Jenny.

1:24:29.148 --> 1:24:31.317
All right, rumble!

1:24:33.611 --> 1:24:37.531
Edna, Edna, Edna,
Edna, Edna, Edna,

1:24:38.407 --> 1:24:45.122
Edna, Edna, Edna, Edna,
Edna, Edna, Edna.

1:24:46.499 --> 1:24:51.504
You've got 30 seconds
to get back to your dorm, or we open fire.

1:24:52.088 --> 1:24:53.506
We're not afraid of you anymore, Edna.

1:24:53.839 --> 1:24:56.550
We're going to that meeting
and we're going to tell it like it is.

1:24:56.884 --> 1:24:58.844
No one moves.

1:24:59.261 --> 1:25:00.888
- You can't kill us all.
- No way.

1:25:01.222 --> 1:25:03.724
Sooner or later, they're going to find out
about the beatings, and the tortures,

1:25:04.058 --> 1:25:05.976
and the murders.
It's all over, Edna.

1:25:06.310 --> 1:25:08.604
We're going in. Killer!

1:25:08.938 --> 1:25:12.483
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!

1:25:12.817 --> 1:25:16.070
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!

1:25:16.403 --> 1:25:19.907
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!

1:25:21.367 --> 1:25:24.203
- Fire!
- Killer! Killer! Killer!

1:25:24.537 --> 1:25:28.999
- Fire, damn it! Fire!
- Killer! Killer!

1:25:29.333 --> 1:25:32.670
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!

1:25:36.298 --> 1:25:38.008
You bitch!

1:26:28.392 --> 1:26:29.727
- Claudia.
- You going to kill her for us?

1:26:30.060 --> 1:26:32.021
You bet your ass, sister.

1:26:33.564 --> 1:26:37.985
Let's get the bitch!
Come on! Vengeance!

1:26:38.319 --> 1:26:39.987
Get her.

1:26:47.745 --> 1:26:51.665
Control! Complete control!

1:28:11.870 --> 1:28:14.081
You fucking bitch! Burn!

1:28:14.415 --> 1:28:16.792
Burn, you bitch! Burn!

1:28:32.850 --> 1:28:36.145
Control! Complete control!

1:28:46.071 --> 1:28:48.699
Control! Do you hear me?

1:28:49.033 --> 1:28:55.331
Complete control! Complete control!

1:28:55.664 --> 1:29:01.378
The name of the game is control.

1:29:01.712 --> 1:29:06.050
See you in hell, Edna.

1:30:17.204 --> 1:30:18.705
Get out of here. And I don't want to see

1:30:19.039 --> 1:30:20.582
that pretty mug of yours back here,
understand?

1:30:20.916 --> 1:30:22.209
You won't, I promise.
