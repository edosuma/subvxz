WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.736
BEN: And then the
monster ripped my guts out,

00:02.770 --> 00:04.805
but I was still alive,
and then he started eating them

00:04.838 --> 00:07.141
even though they smelled
like barf, but he didn't care.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.643
And then I screamed for help,
but no one came,

00:09.677 --> 00:13.347
and then he slipped in the barf,
and then I woke up.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.716
W-Wait, I am confused.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.219
Did it just smell like barf,

00:18.252 --> 00:19.820
or was there actual barf?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.055
Both.
Okay.
Oh.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.824
Look, Ben, that sounds really
scary, I totally understand,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.059
but you're just having
nightmares, you know?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.160
Monsters aren't real.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.828
It is real! One night,

00:27.861 --> 00:29.663
he's gonna come
and finish the job,

00:29.697 --> 00:31.232
and you'll be sorry.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.700
Ay, Benny, come on.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.001
Yeah, all good, bro. I-I get it.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.236
For sure.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.837
Hey, I'm sorry, too.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.672
And listen, like...

00:38.706 --> 00:40.040
Oh, totally, totally.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.775
Dope, dope.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.511
All right.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.079
Peace.

00:45.813 --> 00:46.780
Damn it.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.082
Who was that?

00:48.116 --> 00:49.217
My new lab partner, Dylan.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.684
Dude's the freaking man.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.520
And we've had
this amazing week together.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.089
Just, you know,
crushing our lab reports,

00:55.123 --> 00:56.390
farting in beakers.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.625
Laughing
our freaking balls off.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.926
Just vibing.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.962
So you guys, like, a thing now?
(Alba and Mickey laugh)

01:01.995 --> 01:03.431
I wish.
Being friends with this kid

01:03.464 --> 01:05.366
would blast me
into a new social stratosphere.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.701
Well, what's the problem?
You're the problem.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.036
I invited him
to sleep over

01:09.069 --> 01:10.304
and seal the deal,

01:10.338 --> 01:11.872
but his stupid mom
won't let him.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.873
How's that my fault?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.041
Because everybody thinks

01:14.074 --> 01:15.743
this is an unsupervised
trash house.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.910
Unsupervised?
Yeah.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.112
Are you kidding me?

01:18.146 --> 01:19.880
I supervise.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.215
Alba, did you know about this?

01:21.249 --> 01:23.050
Oh, yeah, it is said often.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.218
By many people.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.053
Mm.
(stammering)

01:26.086 --> 01:27.588
Well, I did not think you cared.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.890
I-I thought you were proud
of your trash brand.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.560
I don't care. But what's
the point of working my ass off

01:32.593 --> 01:34.495
if nobody knows
I'm working my ass off?

01:34.528 --> 01:36.464
'Cause it is a blessing, okay?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.832
This place has been heaven
ever since these kids

01:38.866 --> 01:40.568
got booted from the system.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.902
What system?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.637
Ay, the system
where you take someone's kid,

01:43.671 --> 01:45.239
you give their parents
the night off.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.740
Then the next weekend,

01:46.774 --> 01:47.808
they return the favor.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.643
And round and round it goes.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.612
That sounds amazing.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.148
Not for me it wasn't.
Poodle would pop her pills

01:54.182 --> 01:57.084
while Alba was left to scrub the
urine from the sleeping bags.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.919
Hold on a second,
so these parents are cool

01:58.952 --> 02:01.589
with a pillhead watching
their kids but not me?

02:01.622 --> 02:02.756
Oh, hell no.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.091
These Greenwich turds
are gonna show me

02:04.124 --> 02:06.327
the respect I deserve.
What does that mean?

02:06.360 --> 02:09.197
It means you're gonna
sleep with that boy.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.668
(indistinct chatter)

02:14.702 --> 02:17.137
There she is.
That's Dylan's mom.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.441
And that's Dylan.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.944
Keep it in your pants
and follow my lead.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.346
'Sup, D-Money?

02:25.379 --> 02:26.980
Oh, Mint Chocolate Chip.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.682
What's good, playboy?

02:28.716 --> 02:30.984
Chip, are you
forgetting something?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.386
Your raw yogurt with bee pollen.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.621
You know
what I always say.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.890
When we feed our brains,
our minds can get to work.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.125
Right, totally.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.627
You're never not saying that.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.530
Hi there, uh, I'm
Chip's Aunt Mackenzie.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.365
I'm Karen, Dylan's mom.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.867
Oh, my goodness, I am so happy

02:46.900 --> 02:48.369
to finally meet you.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.138
Chip here is just head over
heels for your little Dylan.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.340
Aunt Mackenzie.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.308
Yeah?
Can Dylan sleep over tonight?

02:54.342 --> 02:56.210
MICKEY:
Oh, Chip, I do know

02:56.244 --> 02:57.378
you have a history
paper due on Monday.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.712
I already wrote it.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.649
Well, you saying there's
no room for improvement?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.151
Why, I have all day Sunday.
Wh-What about church?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.920
I could do it after.
I don't see how that

03:06.954 --> 03:09.189
leaves room for puzzle
hour at the senior center.
Please.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.558
Mm-hmm. Yep, ye-- okay.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.059
Well, it has to be okay
with Dylan's mom.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.361
Oh, Mom, can I, please?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.496
Oh, I don't think so,
sweetheart.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.665
It's no offense,
I just don't know you very well.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.568
Absolutely, no offense taken.
I'm the exact same way.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.736
Come on, we'll be
good. I promise.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.238
Well...

03:24.272 --> 03:29.209
My husband is out of town,
and I'm kind of short-handed.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.678
Honestly, it's perfectly fine.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.380
Just let me take him
off your hands.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.349
Run a bubble bath, slug down
a bottle of... of, uh,

03:35.383 --> 03:37.351
a glass, have a glass
of wine. You know?

03:37.385 --> 03:40.421
That does sound nice.
Yeah.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.690
Okay, what the heck?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.292
Totes.
I guess it's all right.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.893
I just have a few guidelines.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.763
No dairy, no refined
sugar, no gluten.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.864
For a cool kid,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.933
this guy comes with a
lot of instructions.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.201
Yeah, he's a nerd.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.536
Hey, Alba, just the woman
I wanted to see.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.204
Okay, I'm gonna need you

03:57.237 --> 04:00.808
to fill the essential oil
diffuser in Dylan's humidifier.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.209
Ooh, no can do.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.777
I am Poodling tonight.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.380
What?
And it says "No heavy
machinery," so...

04:06.414 --> 04:08.215
No... Damn you.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.719
I mean, look at all this crap.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.220
Whoa.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.388
What's that for?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.956
That's an adrenaline shot.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.991
That's to bring Dylan back
from the dead in the event

04:18.025 --> 04:20.394
he finds himself
in the same room as a peanut.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.663
God. I love a good sleepover.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.233
You know? The bonding,
the secrets, the pranks.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.601
I guarantee you,

04:27.635 --> 04:29.570
someone gets this jammed
in their ass tonight.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.805
All right. This is an
important night for me.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.574
I don't need Dylan going
home and telling his mom

04:33.607 --> 04:34.742
he was sharing secrets

04:34.775 --> 04:36.577
and jamming asses with
a strange grown man.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.611
In fact, take Ben to bed.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.912
All right.
What about the monster?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.180
Buddy.
(sighs)

04:40.213 --> 04:42.316
If you encounter any monsters
tonight, tell you what,

04:42.350 --> 04:44.251
just dream up some ice picks,
you know?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.754
And stab him in his face a
bunch of times. Sound good?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.656
Yeah.
Okay.
(retches)

04:48.689 --> 04:50.257
Ooh!

04:50.290 --> 04:51.592
Swoopy bang brothers.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.960
Good to see you guys.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.194
Hey, Dylan,

04:54.227 --> 04:56.263
did you want your fish oils now,
or did you want to wait

04:56.296 --> 04:59.600
and have them with your ginseng
and milk-thistle lozenges?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.134
You don't have to actually
do all that stuff.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.269
My mom's
kind of crazy.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.104
Well, no... no crazier than me.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.607
Right, Chip? I'm, like,
the craziest mom in town.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.676
You're not a mom.
Well, I'm strict as hell.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.844
And I'm crossing every single
item off of this list.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.213
Including... no cell
phones after 8:00.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.615
Thank you.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.183
(quietly): Dude, I thought
you said she was chill.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.051
Well, she is, just...

05:18.085 --> 05:19.653
Mickey, a word?

05:19.687 --> 05:20.854
Hmm?

05:20.888 --> 05:23.357
Listen, I kind of told
Dylan you were chill,

05:23.391 --> 05:26.860
so I'm gonna need you to go
ahead and be chill, you feel me?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.998
Yeah, I feel you. Yeah.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.567
Here you go, buddy, go nuts.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.669
You're kidding, right?
I gave you $200.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.337
Yeah, you're gonna want
to learn to bribe better.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.339
That's about as crazy
as it's gonna get tonight.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.143
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, missy.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.512
Where do you think you're going?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.246
None of your business, jackass.

05:46.279 --> 05:50.651
Whoa! Wha... That's no way
to talk to your superior.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.821
That will be one...
demerit for you.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.823
Okay, whatever you're doing,
stop it.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.491
I'm going to study at Kylie's.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.159
Good, good.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.428
Go study. Study hard.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.663
School is very
important to me, Dylan.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.765
You'll want to tell your mom
that. Tell all the moms.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.100
Screw this. Come on, homie.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.069
Let's go kick it in my dojo.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.740
(snoring)

06:12.773 --> 06:15.543
(man speaking Spanish
on television)

06:15.576 --> 06:17.377
JIMMY:
Oh...

06:21.314 --> 06:23.050
First one asleep.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.852
Sorry, Alba.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.787
Rules are rules.

06:28.288 --> 06:32.359
Dylan, time for your melatonin
tea, and then lights out.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.627
CHIP:
Just a second.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.395
Come on,
hurry up.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.698
What's going on in there?
(chuckles)

06:37.731 --> 06:39.467
You know we don't lock
the doors in this house.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.101
(bumping, clattering)

06:41.134 --> 06:42.670
Hurry.
I am.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.077
Smells like lip balm
and cigarettes in here.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.479
(clattering, coughing)

06:52.412 --> 06:53.847
I can explain.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.086
(giggles)

06:59.119 --> 07:00.120
Who's this?

07:00.153 --> 07:01.388
I'm Olivia.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.124
Who the hell are you?

07:04.157 --> 07:06.026
(laughs)

07:12.533 --> 07:13.934
Where the hell did this chick
come from?
She's Dylan's girlfriend.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.169
She showed up
like this, I swear.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.172
That's, like, a $500 bottle
of cognac.
It tastes like ass.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.240
Well, you look like ass.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.075
Give that to me.
Please don't
tell my mom.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.611
Okay, she'll freak
if she finds out.
(doorbell rings)

07:23.644 --> 07:25.613
Okay, just, you...
Don't move.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.914
I am not done
with you two.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.749
(laughing)

07:28.782 --> 07:31.619
Get off the bed.
No.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.921
Hey. Can I help you?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.524
I'm sorry to bother you; I'm
looking for my daughter Olivia.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.925
Is she here?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.293
Uh, Olivia, no.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.162
No, nobody here
by that name.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.296
Yeah, sorry about that.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.633
Uh, please, please.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.969
She raided my liquor cabinet
and snuck out.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.506
I tracked the GPS on
my phone to this house.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.174
Can you just check for me?

07:54.207 --> 07:56.510
Yeah. Yeah.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.112
Yeah, of course I can.
Excuse me.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.714
Chip!

08:00.748 --> 08:02.449
It's your girlfriend.
This is your house.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.451
Oh, well, at least
she was drinking

08:04.484 --> 08:05.619
on a full stomach-- real good.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.387
Okay, Olivia's dad's downstairs.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.522
He tracked her phone here.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.857
What? What-What
are we gonna do?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.458
Wh-Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
just relax, milk thistle, okay?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.626
We don't have a lot of time.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.627
Now, who else knows she's here?

08:13.661 --> 08:14.962
Just us.
Okay, great.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.396
So get on her phone
and delete anything

08:16.429 --> 08:17.631
that traces her
back to the house.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.866
Text messages,
pictures, whatever.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.001
Jimmy!
It's locked.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.037
Yeah, so wipe the puke off her
thumb and unlock it. Jimmy!

08:26.406 --> 08:28.809
What...
What the hell is this?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.144
"Come over to Chip's house."
No, wait, dude, hold on.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.080
"We can use his room
to make out."
No, n-no, it's
not like that.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.348
"I think he might be
in love with me."
Dude, dude, dude.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.884
You're reading that
totally out of context.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.885
"He's trying to impress me

08:37.918 --> 08:39.086
by sniffing his own farts."

08:39.119 --> 08:40.554
Bro, I thought you
thought it was funny.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.823
I did, I thought it
was mad funny, dude,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.725
but you kept doing it
and it got weird.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.526
Forget you-- let's
feed him to the wolves.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.195
All right, no...
Please do not feed
me to the wolves.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.663
No one's gonna be feeding
anybody to the wolves.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.765
All right?
This is my one shot

08:51.799 --> 08:53.400
to get into the system,

08:53.433 --> 08:55.402
and you guys are not gonna
blow it for me-- understood?

08:55.435 --> 08:58.505
Oh... that is gross
but excellent.
I know.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.040
What? No, no, no,
no, I know, no.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.842
I'm gonna draw on her.
I know you want
to draw on her,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.677
but you can't 'cause
her dad's downstairs.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.045
He traced her here
through her phone,

09:05.078 --> 09:07.014
like come kind of freakin'
CIA agent.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.682
I need you to take the phone
and get it as far away

09:08.716 --> 09:09.717
from this house as possible.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.686
Mischief.
I like it.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.287
Just keep him on the move
long enough for us

09:14.321 --> 09:15.589
to get his daughter home safely.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.724
Done.
Okay. Oh...

09:16.757 --> 09:18.191
Epic night.
Jimmy!

09:18.225 --> 09:19.893
Yeah?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.061
You want to take the phone?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.730
Oh, yeah.
I was so excited.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.064
You got excited, I know.
I'm, like, halfway.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.366
I know you are.
Dylan, you start mopping up.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.301
Chip? You ever want to have
anybody over to the house again,

09:28.335 --> 09:30.704
come with me.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.874
Hey, yeah, so she's not here.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.242
(sighs)

09:35.275 --> 09:38.278
But my nephew did want
to tell you something.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.614
Go ahead, Chip.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.283
Olivia was here,
but she's gone now.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.286
(sighs) Did she say
where she was going?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.221
I don't know, it was kind
of hard to understand her.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.723
She was really liquored up.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.224
Oh, God, not again.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.662
Yeah, it kind of seemed
like she wanted to hook up.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.496
I mean, I wasn't even
attracted to her,

09:56.529 --> 09:57.831
'cause I like
confident women...

09:57.865 --> 10:00.600
Knock it off, knock it off.
That'll do.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.902
So sorry about
your daughter.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.236
And we do hope you find her.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.605
But wait, wait, wait.
It says right here...

10:05.639 --> 10:07.841
She's on the move.
Oh?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.176
I'm sorry, I've got to go.
CHIP:
All right.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.078
It's cool, good luck, yeah.
Hope you find her.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.245
I mean...

10:12.279 --> 10:13.747
Is he gone?
MICKEY:
Yeah, for now.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.649
We've got to move fast.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.284
Okay, Chip,
open it up.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.853
What? Not the trunk.
You trying to get me crucified?

10:19.887 --> 10:20.954
I'm sorry, I've never held a...

10:20.988 --> 10:22.422
(retching)
Oh!

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
Oh, my God.
Okay.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.425
I thought she got it all
out in the living room.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.661
My bad. Trunk it is.
We're not going too far.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.330
Come on.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.232
(panting)

10:34.134 --> 10:36.503
Yeah.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.639
Do a water and a beer.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.842
Mischief.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.912
(sighs):
Yeah.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.283
(sighs):
Yeah.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.152
(panting)

10:56.489 --> 11:00.293
(ringtone): * 'Cause it feels
so good to be bad *

11:00.327 --> 11:04.798
* I don't even try to be,
but it's all right... *

11:04.832 --> 11:06.399
You son of a bitch.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.768
Oh.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.738
Oh.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.340
All right, you know,
I can explain this.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.377
Aunt Mickey,
I had a nightmare.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.681
Aunt Mickey?

11:28.588 --> 11:29.757
Hello?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.224
Anybody there?

11:31.258 --> 11:34.194
Where are you guys?
(footstep splats)

11:36.764 --> 11:39.332
He's here. He's here.
He's here. (gasps)

11:39.366 --> 11:41.201
Alba.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.203
Alba.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.538
Alba, wake up!

11:45.572 --> 11:47.507
There's a monster in the house!

11:47.540 --> 11:48.675
Wake up.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.611
Alba!

11:51.644 --> 11:54.381
(gurgling)
Where is she?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.416
Where is she?!

11:56.449 --> 11:58.085
(grunts)

11:58.118 --> 11:59.586
What are you doing
with my daughter's phone?!

11:59.619 --> 12:00.754
I don't know.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.725
(groans)

12:06.894 --> 12:08.962
I just found it,
all right?

12:08.996 --> 12:11.231
Pack of girls comes in
here like Coyote Ugly,

12:11.264 --> 12:12.465
and one of
'em drops it.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.101
Oh, my God.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.904
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.872
What have I done?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.942
I'm just...

12:21.975 --> 12:24.011
I'm scared to death
about my daughter.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.714
(groans)

12:27.747 --> 12:29.783
How old is she?

12:29.817 --> 12:32.052
She's 14.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.455
Yeah, that's about the time
they start going nuts.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.059
Their whole system
down there is

12:39.092 --> 12:41.461
firing off
God knows when.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.164
They got every magazine cover
telling them they're ugly,

12:44.197 --> 12:47.567
uncomfortable shoes
and lotions and creams.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.003
Too much, for everybody.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.072
You're a dad, too?

12:52.105 --> 12:55.442
Oh... yeah, big-time.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.745
18, 14 and seven.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.447
Seven was a surprise.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.918
My wife had her tubes tied,
but my guys busted through.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.355
I'm sorry I kicked
your ass like that.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.690
Yeah, you didn't really
kick my ass, all right?

13:10.723 --> 13:14.494
You just... you got
a drop on me.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.696
Thank you.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.300
You just drive...
just drive safe.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.634
(door closes)

13:21.668 --> 13:22.802
(groaning)

13:22.836 --> 13:25.105
Come on, this chick is heavy.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.007
She's got, like, a
million freakin' keys.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.976
There's a car coming!
Okay last one,

13:29.009 --> 13:30.310
and we're tossing
her in the bushes.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.479
Oh, you got
lucky, bitch.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.717
(Olivia coughing)

13:37.750 --> 13:38.952
Oh, come on, Chip.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.487
I thought she was
gonna yak on me.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.789
You and the backstabber
take over from here.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.124
Dude, I'm sorry, okay?
(grunts)

13:44.157 --> 13:46.860
I-I only said those things
to make Olivia laugh.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.996
Oh, so I'm like
a joke to you now.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.164
All right, fine.
I'll admit it, at first,

13:51.198 --> 13:52.465
we just needed
a place to hook up.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.634
But then I really
started to like you.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.204
Okay, so now you're using me
for my trash house?

13:57.237 --> 14:00.507
Hey! Stop calling it that, okay?
It's a mansion.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.075
All right, come on,
as if you weren't using me

14:02.109 --> 14:03.076
for my popularity.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.144
It wasn't
like that, Dylan.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.745
It was always about you.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.547
Can't we just be homies again?

14:07.580 --> 14:11.051
I wish we could, but it's
a little too late for that now.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.253
Okay, can you guys
either fight or kiss

14:13.286 --> 14:14.821
or just shut the
hell up, please?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.323
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)

14:16.356 --> 14:17.357
(whispers):
Someone's home.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.393
Okay, hide, hide, hide.
Where?

14:20.427 --> 14:23.496
Uh, here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.498
Shh, shh, shh. Shh!

14:25.532 --> 14:26.433
MICKEY:
Ouch!

14:30.938 --> 14:34.007
Oh, Olivia. Thank God.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.276
DYLAN (whispering):
Oh, God, the jig is up.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.710
We're so toast.
Shh.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.247
If he sees us, he's within
his rights to shoot us.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.382
If you guys don't shut up,
I'm gonna shoot you.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.451
You scared the hell
out of me tonight, kiddo.

14:44.484 --> 14:48.521
Look, I know I haven't
always been the best father,

14:48.555 --> 14:52.692
but you have got to cool it
with this behavior.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.362
She's damaged goods.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.065
I want a freakin'
grilled cheese.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.300
God, that sounds good.
I'm starving.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.901
Shh.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.536
Just get some rest.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.305
(sighs)

15:05.338 --> 15:07.640
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.878
(footsteps receding)

15:11.911 --> 15:13.146
(sighs)
Shh.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.414
Better tell your mom

15:14.447 --> 15:16.783
I was like a freaking
prison warden.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.486
(doorbell rings)
(gasps)

15:19.519 --> 15:20.653
Shh.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.156
Shh, shh.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.225
(doorbell rings)

15:25.258 --> 15:26.259
Shh.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.898
Hello.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.400
DYLAN: Mom?
(door closes)

15:33.433 --> 15:35.002
Damn it, Dylan, your mom
tracked your phone here.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.103
My-my phone doesn't
have tracking.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.337
Then what's she doing here?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.771
DON:
You would not believe

15:38.805 --> 15:39.906
the night I've had.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.174
Poor baby.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.644
Let me make it all better.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.079
(Karen and Don moaning)

15:46.113 --> 15:47.947
(gasping)
Shh.

15:47.981 --> 15:51.618
(Karen and Don laughing)

15:51.651 --> 15:56.356
This... is... awesome.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.871
Alba, wake up!

16:11.904 --> 16:13.773
(screaming)

16:13.806 --> 16:14.807
(screaming)

16:14.841 --> 16:17.444
Monster!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.678
Benito!

16:18.711 --> 16:19.946
(shouting)

16:19.979 --> 16:21.548
Oh, no.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.782
(grunts)

16:22.815 --> 16:24.884
Oh, no. That's not good.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.553
No. Ugh!

16:26.586 --> 16:28.788
Benito!

16:28.821 --> 16:29.856
Oh, no!

16:29.889 --> 16:31.191
Where you go?!

16:31.224 --> 16:34.161
(chuckles)
All right, guys.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.163
Yo, check this out.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.797
(Karen and Don sigh)

16:37.830 --> 16:38.998
Better?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.467
So much better.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.635
(laughs)

16:42.669 --> 16:43.970
(Karen sighs)

16:44.003 --> 16:47.140
For what it's worth, your mom's
got a pretty rocking body.

16:47.174 --> 16:47.974
Chip, shut up.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.842
Oh!

16:49.876 --> 16:51.078
Don is live

16:51.111 --> 16:52.545
and uncut.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.980
Gross.
DON: How'd you get away, anyway?

16:54.013 --> 16:57.517
Dylan's spending the night
at his friend Chip's.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.352
Chip Pemberton?

16:59.386 --> 17:00.987
Short little toad, red hair?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.522
KAREN:
Yeah.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.657
I think he's in love
with Dylan or something.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.726
DON: I was at his house
earlier looking for Olivia.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.328
He didn't say anything
about Dylan being there.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.363
That's weird.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.399
DON: Olivia was pretty hammered
when she got home, too.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.566
Come on.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.002
That's it.
I'm calling right now.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.771
(phone vibrating)

17:18.805 --> 17:21.174
No, no, no, no.

17:21.208 --> 17:25.612
That bitch just
hung up on me.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.680
I'm driving over there.
Right now?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.217
What? Come on.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.186
Bye. Thank you.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.222
All right, mom of the year's
got a head start,

17:35.255 --> 17:38.591
so we got to hurry.
Go, go, go.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.528
I don't want to alarm you,
but we hit anything below dog,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.696
and we're not stopping.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.765
(engine revving)

17:47.634 --> 17:49.269
You guys go upstairs.
She's gonna be here soon.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.204
What's this?
Aunt Mickey!

17:51.238 --> 17:52.872
The monster's real
and it's scary!

17:52.905 --> 17:54.073
(groans)
He either wants to

17:54.107 --> 17:55.074
drown me in his barf

17:55.108 --> 17:56.543
or skin me alive with his claws!
I know.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.044
It's okay, it's okay,
don't worry, don't worry.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.779
Listen, I know you're upset,
and you're scared of the monster

17:59.812 --> 18:00.980
and I'm sorry, but I've
told you a hundred times,

18:01.013 --> 18:02.081
they're not real, okay?

18:02.115 --> 18:03.783
So you don't...

18:03.816 --> 18:06.719
(groaning):
Benito...
(screams)

18:06.753 --> 18:08.121
Oh!

18:09.122 --> 18:11.224
Alba? Oh.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.059
You don't come creeping up
behind someone...

18:13.092 --> 18:14.394
(doorbell rings)
Coming!

18:14.427 --> 18:17.297
Here you go. You see?
That's all you got to do.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.604
Karen? Hey. Oh.
Dylan?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.606
Come on in.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.575
Is, um, s-something
the matter?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.643
I called, but
no one answered.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.279
I know. Oh, gosh.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.746
The-the reception's
real spotty.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.681
(scoffs)
You know.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.916
Oh, hey, Mom.
What are you doing here?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.286
Well, I was worried, but...

18:40.487 --> 18:42.789
...looks like
everything is okay.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.257
CHIP:
Evening, Ms. Sherman.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.693
Mm-hmm.
Got a real glow about you.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.862
What is that?

18:49.896 --> 18:50.963
What?

18:50.997 --> 18:52.131
Did you not read the list?

18:52.165 --> 18:53.266
Oh.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.667
I was very clear.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.337
No phone after 8:00.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.671
MICKEY:
Yeah, I know.

18:58.705 --> 18:59.939
No, the thing is
I-I did read the list.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.208
Right? I read the list.
Yeah.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.809
Yeah, I just must have
forgotten that one.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.845
You just missed that one?
(chuckles)

19:05.878 --> 19:07.780
I'm sorry, but that's
not gonna fly with me.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.149
Huh. Yeah, gosh.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.985
Just seems like a pretty small
thing in the whole scheme

19:13.019 --> 19:15.288
of what could've
gone wrong tonight, you know?

19:15.322 --> 19:17.324
Dylan, we're leaving.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.458
What? Mom, stop.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.293
Hush. I trusted this woman,

19:20.327 --> 19:22.128
despite her reputation,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.130
and she has betrayed
Mommy's trust.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.732
Oh, hmm. Just like
you betrayed Dad's?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.868
Mm-kay, ginseng, you sure
you know what you're doing here?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.837
What?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.672
Uh, I know about
you and Don.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.173
How?

19:34.207 --> 19:35.475
I-It doesn't matter how, Karen!

19:35.508 --> 19:36.676
'Cause I freaking
know everything!

19:36.709 --> 19:38.378
So why don't you mind your own

19:38.411 --> 19:39.812
little messed up life

19:39.846 --> 19:40.880
and butt out of mine?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.350
(doorbell rings)

19:43.383 --> 19:44.651
(chuckles):
Okay.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.985
Excuse me.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.487
I'm gonna get that.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.322
But is it just me,
or do you feel like

19:49.356 --> 19:51.658
I'm not the worst parent
in the room?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.593
(laughs)

19:55.027 --> 19:56.763
(exhales)

19:56.796 --> 19:57.664
(chuckles)

19:57.697 --> 19:59.566
(dance music playing,
girls laughing)

19:59.599 --> 20:00.833
(car door closes,
Sabrina snoring)

20:00.867 --> 20:02.269
MICKEY: Hmm.
GIRL: Good night, princess!

20:02.302 --> 20:04.937
No idea who that is.
(car drives off, girls whooping)

20:04.971 --> 20:06.406
Come on, Dylan.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.575
We're leaving.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.880
Listen, I'm sorry
I've been such a jerk, man.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.282
Water under the bridge.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.250
I'm sorry you had
to see your mom naked.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.951
That's got to be pretty intense.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.389
Yeah. Yeah, it was, but...

20:22.422 --> 20:25.091
hey, at least I came out of it
with a homie, right?

20:25.124 --> 20:27.394
For sure, brah.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.267
(groans)

20:34.301 --> 20:36.303
Oh, Chip 'n Dip,
by the way, next week,

20:36.336 --> 20:37.870
sleepover at my house,
all right?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.439
For sure, D-Train.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.973
All right,
word to Big Bird, bro.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.111
Okay.

20:45.144 --> 20:48.715
All in all, I think that's
one for the win column, huh?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.618
We are totally in the
system, my friend.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.721
And I totally
bagged Dylan.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.156
I wish you could
hear yourself.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.458
(groans)

20:58.491 --> 21:00.327
Want to bring her inside?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.362
No. I don't
feel like it.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.804
Morning.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.105
Morning.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.441
(Mickey snoring)

21:15.842 --> 21:17.610
(exhales)

21:17.644 --> 21:19.779
(Mickey continues snoring)

21:35.562 --> 21:36.963
SABRINA:
None of your business, jackass.
