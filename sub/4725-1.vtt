WEBVTT

03:55.300 --> 03:57.200
I had the craziest dream last night.

03:59.642 --> 04:01.552
I was dancing the White Swan.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.512
It was different choreography, though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

04:10.524 --> 04:12.154
It was the prologue,

04:12.183 --> 04:14.973
when Rothbart casts his spell.

04:24.275 --> 04:27.395
Look how pink. So pretty...

04:27.433 --> 04:30.195
Pretty!

04:30.236 --> 04:34.258
- You're in a good mood.
- He promised to feature me more this season.

04:34.298 --> 04:36.468
Well, he certainly should.

04:36.507 --> 04:38.397
You've been there long enough,

04:38.435 --> 04:41.287
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

04:45.557 --> 04:46.649
Up.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.519
- What's that?
- What?

04:49.557 --> 04:50.717
There.

04:54.529 --> 04:55.169
Nothing.

04:59.701 --> 05:01.091
You're sure you don't want me
to come with you?

05:04.392 --> 05:05.282
You're a sweet girl.

06:19.451 --> 06:20.531
Did you see Beth today?

06:20.561 --> 06:22.803
I can't believe she's back.

06:22.843 --> 06:26.193
- Of course she's back.
- What, she can't take a hint?

06:26.222 --> 06:29.424
The company is broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.

06:29.464 --> 06:32.114
Oh, nobody actually comes
to see ballet full stop.

06:32.153 --> 06:35.535
That's not true. I heard The Royal
had one of their best seasons yet.

06:35.565 --> 06:37.485
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

06:37.514 --> 06:40.186
No, someone new.

06:41.525 --> 06:44.355
- Like who?
- Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

06:44.385 --> 06:45.827
It's sad.

06:45.857 --> 06:47.487
What's sad?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.728
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

06:53.757 --> 06:55.297
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.839
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties.
- Yeah, we know.

07:06.669 --> 07:07.259
Great.

07:07.299 --> 07:09.791
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

07:09.831 --> 07:12.251
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

08:03.988 --> 08:05.548
Beautiful as always, Nina.

08:05.578 --> 08:07.810
Relax.

08:12.528 --> 08:15.430
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.950
Stop, John.
One second.

08:35.052 --> 08:36.742
Okay, take position.

08:36.772 --> 08:40.724
And one, and two,
and three, and up.

08:40.764 --> 08:44.186
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

08:57.057 --> 08:57.487
Hello, dear.

09:05.527 --> 09:07.159
We all know the story.

09:07.199 --> 09:09.909
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

09:09.939 --> 09:12.579
trapped in the body of a swan.

09:12.607 --> 09:16.089
She desires freedom

09:16.119 --> 09:19.061
that only true love can break the spell.

09:21.930 --> 09:27.402
Her wish is nearly granted
in the form of a Prince.

09:27.441 --> 09:31.603
But before he can declare his love,

09:31.643 --> 09:37.725
The lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him.

09:42.202 --> 09:47.604
Devastated,
the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

09:47.633 --> 09:52.565
killing herself.
And in death...

09:52.594 --> 09:55.396
finds freedom.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.977
- Good morning, company.
- Good morning.

10:05.936 --> 10:08.268
<i>We will open our season
with Swan Lake.</i>

10:08.298 --> 10:10.498
Done to death, I know.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.097
But not like this.

10:12.126 --> 10:16.988
We strip it down,
make it visceral and real.

10:19.030 --> 10:21.880
A new production
needs a new Swan Queen.

10:23.608 --> 10:25.630
A fresh face to present to the world.

10:27.990 --> 10:32.862
But... Which of you
can embody both Swans?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.232
The White, and the Black.

10:42.914 --> 10:45.254
All the soloists I tapped:

10:46.122 --> 10:48.364
Go to your scheduled rehearsals
this afternoon.

10:51.174 --> 10:52.974
And the girls I didn't tap:

10:55.336 --> 10:57.286
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

10:57.314 --> 10:58.764
Thank you.

11:03.365 --> 11:04.045
All right.

11:04.085 --> 11:06.757
- Let's go. Did we do left side?
- Yes, mistress.

11:44.282 --> 11:44.872
Fuck! Fuck!

11:50.933 --> 11:51.573
What?

13:32.477 --> 13:35.279
If I was only casting the White Swan,
she'd be yours.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.299
But I'm not.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.081
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.851
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.484
Not so controlled.
Seduce us.

14:09.513 --> 14:12.785
Not just the Prince, but the court,
the audience, the entire world.

14:12.825 --> 14:15.977
Come on,
like a spider spinning a web.

14:16.017 --> 14:18.467
Attack it, attack it!
Come on!

14:29.968 --> 14:30.578
Well...

14:30.608 --> 14:32.898
- Good of you to join us.
- Sorry...

14:32.936 --> 14:34.788
Girls, this is Lily.

14:34.819 --> 14:38.399
Straight off the plane from San Francisco.
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

14:38.428 --> 14:40.090
- Hey.
- Get warmed up.

14:40.120 --> 14:40.970
No, it's okay.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.180
I'm good.

14:44.748 --> 14:45.538
Should I go again?

14:47.170 --> 14:48.460
No, thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.052
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

14:58.063 --> 14:58.943
Come on, come on, come on, please.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.872
All right, Maestro.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.604
Two, three...

16:11.323 --> 16:11.863
So how'd it go?

16:13.852 --> 16:15.854
You were late, so I called
Susie in the office.

16:15.895 --> 16:19.035
An audition! I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

16:19.063 --> 16:21.245
So?

16:21.275 --> 16:23.065
It was fine.

16:23.105 --> 16:25.045
Just fine?

16:27.567 --> 16:28.697
Oh, sweetheart...

16:31.265 --> 16:32.527
You tell me about it.

17:26.836 --> 17:27.976
Nina, everything all right?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.015
I'm fine.

17:43.918 --> 17:44.638
Almost done.

17:44.668 --> 17:46.838
You're working yourself too hard.

17:49.207 --> 17:52.449
- We all have off days.
- That girl, um, barged in.

17:52.479 --> 17:54.319
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

17:57.550 --> 18:02.562
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of
your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

18:02.601 --> 18:05.071
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
I'm going to tell him I finished it.

18:05.109 --> 18:06.529
You don't need to lie.

18:07.672 --> 18:09.302
You won't convince him
one way or the other.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.192
Oh, sweetheart.

18:16.691 --> 18:17.881
I know it's disappointing.

18:19.484 --> 18:21.564
When you start getting older,
there's all this

18:22.753 --> 18:25.335
ridiculous pressure.
God knows I understand.

18:27.335 --> 18:28.445
But it's all right.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.365
No matter what.

18:33.215 --> 18:36.075
You'll probably get to dance
the part of the cat again.

18:37.397 --> 18:39.457
That's such a wonderful part.

18:39.496 --> 18:42.206
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

18:42.235 --> 18:46.167
Either way, you'll shine.

18:48.366 --> 18:48.836
You know...

18:50.318 --> 18:51.658
Everything will be better
in the morning.

18:54.426 --> 18:55.948
It always is.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.358
Sweet girl.

19:26.634 --> 19:27.324
Yes, Nina?

19:27.353 --> 19:28.633
Do you have a minute?

19:32.544 --> 19:34.634
- Now's not a good time. I get it.
- Now is perfect.

19:37.606 --> 19:38.566
So...

19:41.614 --> 19:43.566
I just wanted to tell you that

19:43.606 --> 19:46.486
I practiced the coda last night and

19:46.525 --> 19:48.375
I finished.

19:53.515 --> 19:54.697
I thought you should know.

19:54.738 --> 19:58.548
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

19:58.577 --> 20:01.529
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday...

20:01.569 --> 20:02.699
No.
Anyway...

20:02.739 --> 20:05.149
I've already chosen Veronica.
Sorry.

20:05.187 --> 20:07.919
Sorry.

20:09.189 --> 20:09.999
Okay, thank you.

20:13.381 --> 20:13.901
That's it?

20:13.941 --> 20:16.431
You're not going to
try and change my mind?

20:18.422 --> 20:19.832
You must have thought
it was possible.

20:19.861 --> 20:23.121
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.323
I came to ask for the part.

20:32.373 --> 20:32.793
Well...

20:32.823 --> 20:35.753
The truth is...

20:35.792 --> 20:39.694
When I look at you,
all I see is the White Swan.

20:39.723 --> 20:43.935
Yes, you're beautiful,
fearful, fragile.

20:44.635 --> 20:45.755
Ideal casting.

20:47.977 --> 20:51.107
But the Black Swan?
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

20:52.235 --> 20:53.807
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

20:53.837 --> 20:54.937
Really?

20:54.977 --> 20:58.037
In four years,
every time you dance,

20:58.066 --> 21:02.918
I see obsess getting each and every move
perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

21:04.087 --> 21:07.039
Ever.
All that discipline for what?

21:11.278 --> 21:12.480
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

21:14.160 --> 21:15.290
I want to be perfect.

21:18.271 --> 21:20.441
Perfection is not just about control.

21:21.950 --> 21:24.072
It's also about letting go.

21:24.102 --> 21:28.732
Surprise yourself so you can
surprise the audience. Transcendence.

21:28.770 --> 21:30.982
And very few have it in them.

21:31.012 --> 21:33.592
I think I do have it in me.

21:41.824 --> 21:42.434
You bit me?

21:42.464 --> 21:45.534
I can't believe you bit me!

21:45.573 --> 21:47.143
I'm sorry.

21:47.173 --> 21:49.355
Man, that fucking hurt!

22:06.338 --> 22:06.968
What?

22:06.998 --> 22:09.178
Why's she always staring at me?

22:11.739 --> 22:13.539
Hey, it's been posted.

22:14.688 --> 22:16.128
Hey, it's up!

22:21.529 --> 22:22.881
Veronica.

22:25.071 --> 22:25.921
Congratulations.

22:41.274 --> 22:42.394
Hey!

22:43.753 --> 22:44.623
Why would you say that?

22:46.332 --> 22:47.824
Your idea of some sick joke?

22:47.865 --> 22:49.225
What?

22:50.883 --> 22:51.693
Fuck you.

23:06.017 --> 23:06.657
Hey, Nina!

23:06.697 --> 23:08.127
Congratulations!

23:14.617 --> 23:15.897
Congratulations.

23:15.906 --> 23:17.368
You're so beautiful.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.348
Congratulations.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.900
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

23:38.940 --> 23:40.882
<i>What is it?
What's wrong?</i>

23:40.913 --> 23:42.483
I'm fine.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.024
He picked me, Mom.

23:49.402 --> 23:50.362
Do you hear me?

23:50.392 --> 23:53.244
<i>- For Swan Lake?
- I'm going to be Swan Queen!</i>

23:55.464 --> 23:56.704
Mom!

23:56.743 --> 23:59.175
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

24:00.235 --> 24:01.275
<i>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

24:36.481 --> 24:37.141
Mom?

24:40.832 --> 24:41.882
Mom, are you in your room?

25:15.717 --> 25:16.507
Nina?

25:16.547 --> 25:17.977
Are you home?

25:30.748 --> 25:32.268
Nina, when you get out
I'm in the kitchen.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.720
Come on, sweetie.

25:40.011 --> 25:42.451
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

25:47.412 --> 25:50.422
It's our favorite.
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

25:50.460 --> 25:52.022
Oh, Mom, not too big.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.992
Oh, that's way, way too much.

25:54.032 --> 25:56.112
- It's a celebration. It's just this once.
- Mom...

25:57.194 --> 25:58.614
My stomach's still in knots.

26:01.342 --> 26:02.092
Fine.

26:02.122 --> 26:03.954
Fine.

26:03.984 --> 26:05.234
Then it's garbage!

26:05.264 --> 26:07.484
No, Mom, don't.
I'm sorry.

26:14.836 --> 26:18.956
I'm just...
I'm just so proud of you.

26:20.748 --> 26:21.728
It looks so yummy.

27:34.008 --> 27:35.108
Okay, okay.

27:35.137 --> 27:36.607
Thank you.
Thank you.

27:36.646 --> 27:38.698
Thank you, Nina.

27:38.729 --> 27:40.479
That's very nice.

27:41.868 --> 27:42.668
Very nice.

27:44.310 --> 27:47.470
But I knew the White Swan
wouldn't be a problem.

27:47.509 --> 27:51.201
The real work will your
metamorphosis into her evil twin.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.980
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

27:56.532 --> 27:58.292
So get ready to give me
more of that bite.

28:20.796 --> 28:21.606
Excellent.

28:22.514 --> 28:27.636
That evil force is pulling you that you
can't escape. That's just out of your control.

28:28.616 --> 28:33.288
So you sense it, you get aware of it more:
"It's taking me, it's taking me."

28:33.327 --> 28:35.987
A little bit more desperate.

28:36.745 --> 28:40.767
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit
and then come down, and then...

28:40.807 --> 28:42.067
That's it.

29:17.093 --> 29:18.413
Watch the way she moves.

29:19.975 --> 29:23.755
Imprecise,
but effortless.

29:26.115 --> 29:27.265
She's not faking it.

29:27.295 --> 29:36.387
Gorgeous!
Okay, that's beautiful.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.267
Let's start again from the beginning.

29:47.506 --> 29:50.178
You'll room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

29:50.219 --> 29:51.549
Thanks, Susie.

29:52.428 --> 29:53.998
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

29:54.038 --> 29:55.980
They're beautiful.

30:14.272 --> 30:15.282
I'll be back in a second.

30:18.874 --> 30:19.644
Let me come back to you, please.

30:23.522 --> 30:23.994
Let's go.

30:29.916 --> 30:31.246
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

30:31.276 --> 30:34.906
We need our cash,
so please don't forget to smile.

30:34.934 --> 30:39.266
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

30:41.255 --> 30:41.817
Good evening.

30:41.848 --> 30:44.698
Let me make this
very important announcement.

30:44.726 --> 30:50.958
You all had had the chance and
the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

30:50.957 --> 30:53.759
and even sometimes devastated,
by the performances

30:53.770 --> 30:55.800
of this true artist of our company.

30:55.799 --> 30:58.809
She's been a crucial
inspiration to my work.

30:58.847 --> 31:02.629
A role model to all dancers,
and even more than that,

31:02.669 --> 31:05.651
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

31:05.691 --> 31:07.781
You all know who I am talking about.

31:07.821 --> 31:11.121
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

31:16.581 --> 31:17.573
But as we all know,

31:17.603 --> 31:19.983
every great career
has to come to an end.

31:20.023 --> 31:24.875
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

31:26.393 --> 31:29.213
She will be giving her
farewell performance as Melpomene,

31:29.245 --> 31:31.765
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

31:34.353 --> 31:35.825
My little princess,

31:35.855 --> 31:39.125
we honor you.
You will be greatly missed,

31:39.874 --> 31:42.216
and never forgotten.

31:42.257 --> 31:46.317
<i>But as we bid adieu to one star,
we welcome another.</i>

31:47.347 --> 31:50.337
<i>We're opening our season
with my new version of Swan Lake.</i>

31:50.377 --> 31:55.349
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,
the exquisite Nina Sayers.

32:01.009 --> 32:03.719
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her perform,

32:03.758 --> 32:11.212
but right now, let's please raise a glass:
To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

32:13.590 --> 32:14.330
To beauty.

32:32.312 --> 32:33.172
Just a second.

32:42.476 --> 32:43.366
Just a second!

33:05.000 --> 33:06.520
Come on!
I'm about to burst!

33:13.389 --> 33:14.839
Hey, it's you!

33:14.869 --> 33:17.451
I don't think we ever
officially met.

33:17.481 --> 33:20.141
- I'm Lily.
- Hi, I'm Nina.

33:20.169 --> 33:22.351
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

33:22.392 --> 33:23.952
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah, sure.

33:25.391 --> 33:29.063
You must be so excited.

33:30.923 --> 33:32.513
Are you freaking out?

33:32.551 --> 33:33.581
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

33:35.823 --> 33:36.663
Oh, it's okay.

33:36.693 --> 33:38.523
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

33:38.563 --> 33:40.785
I should get back...

33:40.825 --> 33:42.525
No, no, no, come on, stay.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.354
Keep me company.

33:48.055 --> 33:48.845
Excuse me.

33:51.434 --> 33:52.236
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

33:57.977 --> 34:00.917
Hey. They tried to eat you alive,
but here you are.

34:02.506 --> 34:03.226
You did well.

34:03.266 --> 34:04.638
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

34:05.918 --> 34:06.728
Where are you going?

34:06.757 --> 34:09.077
Upper west side.

34:09.106 --> 34:10.888
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

34:10.919 --> 34:14.679
Thomas, you need to say hello
to Karen Holloway.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.120
A minute more of ass-kissing.
I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

34:22.071 --> 34:23.161
Hello, Karen!

35:05.507 --> 35:06.337
Beth!

35:08.455 --> 35:10.267
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

35:12.627 --> 35:14.117
What did you do to get this role?

35:17.469 --> 35:20.159
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

35:20.187 --> 35:23.609
What did you do to make
him change his mind?

35:23.639 --> 35:27.771
Did you suck his cock?

35:27.781 --> 35:29.531
Not all of us have to.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.711
You fucking whore!

35:33.742 --> 35:37.112
You're a fucking little whore!

35:37.151 --> 35:38.561
Whoa, what's going on here?

35:38.590 --> 35:41.722
Hey, I need to talk to you.

35:41.762 --> 35:43.892
- You're drunk. You should go home.
- I need to talk to you.

35:43.921 --> 35:47.613
No! Don't you do that!
Don't you dismiss me like that!

35:50.132 --> 35:52.794
My little princess, please.
Pull it together.

35:54.593 --> 35:56.203
- Come.
- I'm coming by later.

35:56.233 --> 36:00.915
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

36:00.944 --> 36:03.676
- Right.
- You make the most of it, Nina.

36:04.916 --> 36:06.236
Don't worry. It's typical.

36:12.176 --> 36:15.038
Please. I thought it'd be good
to talk about the role.

36:15.069 --> 36:16.379
Drown this a little.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.658
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

36:18.697 --> 36:20.749
- No, me neither.
- Good.

36:20.779 --> 36:25.149
So...
You got a boyfriend?

36:26.980 --> 36:27.390
No.

36:29.319 --> 36:31.269
Have you had many in the past?

36:32.631 --> 36:33.341
A few.

36:33.381 --> 36:35.031
But no one serious.

36:39.882 --> 36:40.892
You're not a virgin are you?

36:44.423 --> 36:45.093
No.

36:45.123 --> 36:47.333
So there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.584
And you enjoy making love?

36:56.435 --> 36:56.935
Excuse me?

36:56.974 --> 36:59.124
Come on, sex.

36:59.154 --> 37:00.554
Do you enjoy it?

37:03.546 --> 37:05.416
We need to be able
to talk about this.

37:13.455 --> 37:15.217
I've got a little homework
assignment for you.

37:15.248 --> 37:19.710
Go home and touch yourself.

37:21.748 --> 37:22.818
Live a little.

37:26.989 --> 37:29.679
Well it's late.
Lots of work tomorrow.

37:29.718 --> 37:32.610
The doorman will
find a cab for you.

37:37.169 --> 37:39.991
Sounds like quite an evening.
I wish I could have been there.

37:40.021 --> 37:41.561
You know I asked.

37:41.589 --> 37:43.359
I know you did.
Susie told me.

37:43.402 --> 37:46.272
Guess he wanted you
all to himself.

37:46.311 --> 37:47.431
But why?

37:47.461 --> 37:49.853
Don't blame him.

37:52.302 --> 37:53.312
Where'd you get these?

37:53.351 --> 37:55.171
They're fake.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.593
Fooled me.

38:06.043 --> 38:06.883
I can do it.

38:10.665 --> 38:14.097
He must have been
by your side all night.

38:14.127 --> 38:17.597
Showing you off.

38:19.847 --> 38:21.587
- Oh, Nina...
- It's just a rash.

38:21.627 --> 38:23.787
Rash?
What are you talking about?

38:23.816 --> 38:25.398
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

38:25.429 --> 38:27.559
- You've been scratching yourself again.
- No I haven't.

38:27.598 --> 38:29.508
Mom!

38:29.547 --> 38:30.989
This disgusting habit...

38:32.659 --> 38:34.439
Jesus Christ, I thought
you were done with this, Nina.

38:35.778 --> 38:37.480
Shrugs.
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

38:37.521 --> 38:38.871
Sit down.
You have the white one,

38:38.910 --> 38:40.930
and the pink one.
And that'll hide it.

38:40.959 --> 38:45.671
And then I'll dig out that expensive
coverup. We still have some.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.640
No one will see it.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.282
Mom, please,

38:49.322 --> 38:53.552
It's the role, isn't it?
It's all this pressure.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.452
I knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

39:00.301 --> 39:00.723
You're all right.

39:03.514 --> 39:04.094
You'll be all right.

41:07.112 --> 41:08.852
Beth's in the hospital.

41:09.622 --> 41:11.914
She had an accident.

41:11.924 --> 41:13.614
Oh no!

41:13.634 --> 41:14.084
Beth?

41:21.993 --> 41:22.593
What happened?

41:25.076 --> 41:26.936
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

41:29.546 --> 41:30.186
You know what?

41:32.216 --> 41:33.936
I'm almost sure
she did it on purpose.

41:35.838 --> 41:36.458
How do you know?

41:37.498 --> 41:41.180
Because everything Beth does comes
from within, from some dark impulse.

41:43.308 --> 41:45.088
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.709
So dangerous.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.149
Even perfect at times.

41:54.610 --> 41:56.460
But also so damned destructive.

41:58.792 --> 42:00.602
Was it right after we saw her?

42:01.631 --> 42:04.511
Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

42:05.539 --> 42:08.651
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

42:08.691 --> 42:11.883
This is your moment, Nina.

42:11.923 --> 42:14.263
Don't let it go.

43:43.756 --> 43:44.996
What are you doing?

45:26.480 --> 45:27.570
Nina?

45:28.972 --> 45:30.932
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

45:40.684 --> 45:43.904
And...
Come on!

45:43.943 --> 45:46.435
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

45:47.466 --> 45:48.866
Come on.

45:52.296 --> 45:54.306
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

45:54.336 --> 45:57.598
Let it go.
Let it go.

45:57.638 --> 45:59.448
And again.

45:59.777 --> 46:03.057
Feels like you have your diaphragm

46:03.085 --> 46:05.807
is in a bit of a contraction?

46:05.848 --> 46:06.968
I'm okay.

46:11.419 --> 46:14.669
Breathe in to this hand.
Breathe in to this hand.

46:14.697 --> 46:16.769
Breathe in, all the way.
Good.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.470
And exhale.

46:21.981 --> 46:25.211
<i>Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you plie?</i>

46:25.240 --> 46:26.712
Sometimes, not always.

46:30.251 --> 46:32.161
- One more pull, okay?
- Okay.

46:37.471 --> 46:37.941
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

46:58.706 --> 47:00.926
David,
can I ask you a question?

47:01.355 --> 47:03.567
Honestly,
would you fuck that girl?

47:06.146 --> 47:07.446
No.

47:07.476 --> 47:08.508
No one would.

47:09.538 --> 47:10.698
Nina...

47:10.728 --> 47:13.418
Your dancing is just as frigid...

47:15.446 --> 47:16.828
Fuck!

47:20.970 --> 47:22.800
We're still working here, please.
Lights!

47:22.829 --> 47:24.249
The lights!

47:25.721 --> 47:26.351
Thank you!

47:27.381 --> 47:30.981
Okay, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

47:31.742 --> 47:32.922
No, no, you stay.
You stay.

47:35.530 --> 47:36.510
Have fun, you two.

47:40.442 --> 47:41.472
Okay.

47:41.512 --> 47:42.682
Come here.

47:42.722 --> 47:43.934
Come, come, come, come.

47:46.663 --> 47:47.863
I'll be the Prince.

48:08.688 --> 48:10.348
Let it go. Let it go.

48:31.202 --> 48:32.042
Feel my touch.

48:32.081 --> 48:33.221
Respond to it.

48:33.251 --> 48:34.511
Come on.

48:47.671 --> 48:50.003
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open up.

49:16.736 --> 49:17.936
That was me seducing you,

49:17.976 --> 49:20.668
when it needs to be
the other way around.

49:21.698 --> 49:22.818
Please...

49:46.341 --> 49:47.711
Who is that?

49:47.820 --> 49:48.882
Hey.

49:51.212 --> 49:52.742
You okay?

49:54.494 --> 49:55.714
You can't smoke in here.

49:56.444 --> 50:00.024
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

50:03.354 --> 50:04.404
So...

50:04.444 --> 50:07.276
The big day's getting closer
and closer, huh?

50:08.565 --> 50:11.827
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're going to be amazing.

50:13.966 --> 50:14.326
Thanks.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.570
So...

50:32.610 --> 50:34.220
Do  you want to talk about it?

50:35.970 --> 50:38.020
It's that hard to.

50:39.709 --> 50:41.809
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

50:42.741 --> 50:44.051
Come on, Nina.
He's a prick.

50:44.091 --> 50:46.121
He's brilliant.

50:46.749 --> 50:50.541
Sure, but it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

50:51.811 --> 50:53.481
What you don't know is...

50:56.203 --> 50:58.603
Someone's hot for teacher!

50:59.994 --> 51:02.724
Oh, come on, it's okay.
I don't blame you.

51:02.753 --> 51:04.143
I should go home.

51:04.183 --> 51:06.895
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

51:07.935 --> 51:09.485
Nina!

52:30.348 --> 52:33.608
Sweetie?
What are you doing in there?

53:01.841 --> 53:02.381
Again.

53:35.697 --> 53:36.687
Again.

53:48.549 --> 53:50.269
Do you have any corrections?

53:55.379 --> 53:57.429
Lily told me that
she saw you crying.

53:59.391 --> 54:00.931
That you were very upset

54:00.961 --> 54:02.861
and that I should
take it easy on you.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.422
I didn't tell her that.

54:04.453 --> 54:06.853
Maybe you need a little break.

54:06.892 --> 54:09.762
A day or two. Or maybe a month.
What do you think?

54:09.790 --> 54:10.972
She shouldn't have said anything.

54:11.013 --> 54:13.133
No, you shouldn't be
whining in the first place.

54:13.172 --> 54:13.922
I didn't.

54:17.624 --> 54:18.764
You could be brilliant.

54:18.804 --> 54:20.704
But you're a coward.

54:20.742 --> 54:23.044
Sorry.

54:23.075 --> 54:25.535
No, stop saying that!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

54:25.574 --> 54:27.094
Stop being so fucking weak.

54:27.124 --> 54:28.526
Again!

54:41.948 --> 54:42.378
Lily...

54:42.417 --> 54:45.497
Oh, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

54:45.526 --> 54:46.458
I need to talk to you.

54:46.488 --> 54:47.408
Okay.

54:47.438 --> 54:48.898
Now.

54:50.277 --> 54:50.767
Shut up.

54:50.797 --> 54:52.019
Come on.

54:56.148 --> 54:56.598
What's up?

54:56.628 --> 54:59.240
You told Thomas about last night?

55:00.939 --> 55:03.831
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and
he said you guys were having some trouble.

55:03.872 --> 55:04.962
Why would he talk to you?

55:04.991 --> 55:07.651
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

55:07.690 --> 55:11.542
I just told him you're working your ass off
and I think you'll be great.

55:11.582 --> 55:12.482
Well you shouldn't have.

55:16.883 --> 55:17.353
Okay.

55:50.506 --> 55:51.788
Has he tried anything with you?

55:56.317 --> 55:57.969
He has a reputation.

56:01.818 --> 56:05.140
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.
You've been staying late so many nights.

56:05.170 --> 56:09.292
Rehearsing. I just hope
he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

56:09.331 --> 56:10.731
He's not.

56:10.771 --> 56:12.381
Good.

56:15.233 --> 56:17.043
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

56:18.771 --> 56:19.171
Thanks.

56:20.690 --> 56:21.372
Not like that.

56:22.693 --> 56:24.733
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

56:24.772 --> 56:25.672
What career?

56:29.694 --> 56:31.394
The one I gave up to have you.

56:33.705 --> 56:34.745
I'm twenty-eight.

56:34.774 --> 56:36.164
So?

56:36.844 --> 56:38.034
Only that...

56:40.176 --> 56:41.096
Only what?

56:41.126 --> 56:42.756
Nothing.

56:42.794 --> 56:44.024
- What?
- Nothing.

56:47.776 --> 56:48.756
How is your skin?

56:48.786 --> 56:50.868
Fine.

56:50.898 --> 56:52.548
- Are you leaving it alone?
- Mm-hmm.

56:55.776 --> 56:56.336
Let me see.

57:01.537 --> 57:02.839
- Take off your shirt.
- No.

57:16.161 --> 57:16.531
Can I help you?

57:21.102 --> 57:21.892
Who was that?

57:21.932 --> 57:23.472
It was no one.

57:25.641 --> 57:26.253
It was no one.

57:31.571 --> 57:32.071
Hello?

57:36.883 --> 57:37.583
What are you doing here?

57:37.623 --> 57:39.575
I just came by to apologize.

57:39.615 --> 57:41.815
You're right. I should have never
spoken to him about you.

57:41.843 --> 57:44.025
- Sweetheart.
- Give me a second.

57:44.056 --> 57:45.716
- Your dinner...
- Mom, please.

57:48.005 --> 57:49.285
Oh, she's a trip.

57:49.294 --> 57:50.686
How do you know where I live?

57:52.127 --> 57:53.217
I have my ways.

57:55.305 --> 57:57.637
Jesus, relax.
I got it from Susie in the office.

57:58.957 --> 58:02.209
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I really want to make it up to you.

58:02.219 --> 58:04.489
So how about I take you out to dinner?

58:05.537 --> 58:08.019
- I don't think...
- Okay, that's fine.

58:08.049 --> 58:10.269
What about drinks?

58:10.309 --> 58:11.949
Sweetie, you need to rest.

58:11.978 --> 58:14.180
- Jesus.
- Wait.

58:16.030 --> 58:16.860
What are you doing?

58:18.239 --> 58:19.029
I'm going out.

58:19.068 --> 58:20.610
What?
Nina!

58:20.641 --> 58:23.311
You're on the stage tomorrow.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.532
I can't believe he calls her that.

58:26.572 --> 58:29.162
- It's so gross.
- I think it's sweet.

58:29.191 --> 58:31.011
Little Princess?

58:31.050 --> 58:33.482
- He probably calls every girl that.
- No way.

58:33.523 --> 58:35.503
That's just for Beth.

58:35.542 --> 58:40.154
Well, I bet he'll be calling you
Little Princess any day now.

58:40.184 --> 58:41.704
I don't know about that.

58:41.732 --> 58:44.964
Oh, sure he will.
Just got to let him lick your pussy.

58:46.624 --> 58:48.764
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

58:48.803 --> 58:50.615
<i>Mmm, dankeschÃ¶n.</i>

58:52.006 --> 58:53.906
Let me know
if that's juicy enough for you.

58:53.944 --> 58:55.746
Oh, I will.

58:57.756 --> 58:59.506
You have enough cheese?

58:59.546 --> 59:01.918
No, but you do.

59:04.596 --> 59:05.306
Enjoy.

59:15.199 --> 59:15.859
All right.

59:22.749 --> 59:24.059
Wanna spruce up?

59:24.089 --> 59:27.201
What, I carry a spare

59:27.241 --> 59:30.461
in case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

59:34.481 --> 59:35.881
So how is he?

59:38.563 --> 59:39.653
Thomas.

59:41.521 --> 59:42.651
I wouldn't know.

59:42.681 --> 59:46.073
- Oh, come on.
- I really don't want to talk about that.

59:48.183 --> 59:48.965
Okay.

59:50.805 --> 59:53.725
You really need to relax.

1:00:01.127 --> 1:00:02.207
One for you,

1:00:02.237 --> 1:00:04.197
one for me.

1:00:05.545 --> 1:00:09.407
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise.
I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

1:00:12.116 --> 1:00:12.808
What is it?

1:00:12.849 --> 1:00:14.899
Are you kidding?

1:00:16.607 --> 1:00:18.137
You've never rolled?

1:00:20.459 --> 1:00:23.719
Oh, relax. Here.
It'll loosen you up.

1:00:25.601 --> 1:00:27.721
Wait till you see the night sky.

1:00:31.651 --> 1:00:32.901
How long does it last?

1:00:32.931 --> 1:00:35.421
A couple hours, tops.

1:00:40.391 --> 1:00:41.671
It's okay.

1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:44.332
Okay.

1:01:46.551 --> 1:01:47.813
Nina, hi!

1:01:47.844 --> 1:01:54.376
I thought we could use some company.
So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

1:01:54.404 --> 1:01:58.064
- Actually it's Andrew.
- Tom.

1:01:58.103 --> 1:02:01.765
- I have to go...
- Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

1:02:02.973 --> 1:02:04.083
I shouldn't...

1:02:04.123 --> 1:02:05.905
We're on the stage tomorrow.

1:02:05.936 --> 1:02:08.036
So what are you going to do?
Go home to Mommy?

1:02:12.187 --> 1:02:13.407
Come on, live a little.

1:02:18.277 --> 1:02:19.467
It's just a couple hours, right?

1:02:20.797 --> 1:02:21.907
Tops.

1:02:26.237 --> 1:02:26.847
Cheers.

1:02:29.139 --> 1:02:30.439
You haven't told me who you are.

1:02:31.429 --> 1:02:32.819
I'm a dancer.

1:02:32.848 --> 1:02:34.398
No, I mean your name.

1:02:36.041 --> 1:02:37.411
- Oh. Nina.
- So are you two sisters?

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:38.370
- Yes.
- No.

1:02:38.379 --> 1:02:42.711
- Blood sisters.
- We dance in the same company.

1:02:42.741 --> 1:02:46.451
Ah, ballerinas.
No wonder you two look alike.

1:02:46.490 --> 1:02:49.442
I see now.
Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

1:02:49.482 --> 1:02:51.432
- Very funny.
- I like to amuse myself.

1:02:51.471 --> 1:02:52.923
I've never been to the ballet.

1:02:52.963 --> 1:02:55.863
Then you are definitely not gay.

1:02:55.902 --> 1:02:57.812
I mean, it's kind of boring,
isn't it?

1:02:57.842 --> 1:02:58.964
- Be honest.
- No it's not.

1:02:58.994 --> 1:03:02.004
You know what?
It's just not for everyone.

1:03:02.033 --> 1:03:04.915
You should come sometime.
I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

1:03:04.945 --> 1:03:06.355
Yeah. Yeah.

1:03:07.214 --> 1:03:08.904
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks.
- Okay well...

1:03:08.944 --> 1:03:10.896
I think it's time for another round.

1:03:12.516 --> 1:03:14.386
Bottoms up.

1:03:18.846 --> 1:03:20.386
So what are you guys
working on now?

1:03:22.155 --> 1:03:24.517
Sorry.

1:03:26.456 --> 1:03:28.346
<i>Swan Lake.</i>

1:03:28.376 --> 1:03:29.648
Yeah?

1:03:29.678 --> 1:03:31.328
You know it?

1:03:31.348 --> 1:03:33.228
No, not really.

1:03:33.237 --> 1:03:34.267
Heard of it.

1:03:34.307 --> 1:03:35.699
What's it about?

1:03:37.049 --> 1:03:39.299
It's about a girl who gets
turned into a swan,

1:03:39.338 --> 1:03:41.910
and she needs love
to break the spell.

1:03:44.239 --> 1:03:46.591
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

1:03:49.380 --> 1:03:50.630
and so she kills herself.

1:03:50.670 --> 1:03:53.872
It's not a happy ending then.

1:03:53.912 --> 1:03:57.042
It's beautiful, actually.

1:04:00.333 --> 1:04:01.293
Like you.

1:04:02.422 --> 1:04:03.372
Huh?

1:04:04.614 --> 1:04:05.634
I said you're beautiful.

1:04:09.663 --> 1:04:10.455
That's funny?

1:04:20.795 --> 1:04:22.767
Looks like someone might be rolling.

1:04:22.807 --> 1:04:26.087
All right, come on.
Come on, it's time to go dance.

1:04:48.729 --> 1:04:49.539
Nina!

1:05:26.154 --> 1:05:28.656
Hey, what the fuck?
Where you going?

1:05:51.770 --> 1:05:52.250
Nina!

1:05:53.660 --> 1:05:54.520
Where are you going?

1:07:18.302 --> 1:07:20.584
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

1:07:20.624 --> 1:07:22.474
Late?

1:07:25.272 --> 1:07:26.524
Where have you been?

1:07:27.335 --> 1:07:29.515
To the moon and back.

1:07:31.564 --> 1:07:33.956
- You've been drinking.
- Ding ding ding ding ding!

1:07:33.976 --> 1:07:35.686
- What else?
- Hmm?

1:07:35.704 --> 1:07:38.246
What else have you been doing?

1:07:39.936 --> 1:07:41.856
Oh, you want to know their names?

1:07:44.048 --> 1:07:47.748
- You need to sleep this off.
- There were two. Tom and Jerry.

1:07:47.766 --> 1:07:50.188
- Be quiet, Nina.
- And I fucked them both.

1:07:50.209 --> 1:07:52.279
Shut your mouth!

1:08:05.230 --> 1:08:06.410
- Don't come in here.
- What's this?

1:08:06.439 --> 1:08:09.811
It's called privacy.
I'm not twelve anymore.

1:08:09.851 --> 1:08:12.391
- You're not my Nina right now...
- Leave me alone!

1:10:09.798 --> 1:10:11.258
Winged girl.

1:11:08.408 --> 1:11:09.688
Why didn't you wake me up?

1:11:12.559 --> 1:11:13.429
I'm moving out.

1:11:18.171 --> 1:11:18.921
My music!

1:11:36.803 --> 1:11:38.213
Thomas, I am so sorry.

1:11:38.252 --> 1:11:40.132
Keep on going.

1:11:41.715 --> 1:11:42.785
Go get warmed up.

1:12:25.460 --> 1:12:26.020
That was good.

1:12:28.639 --> 1:12:29.511
Actually, really good.

1:12:29.542 --> 1:12:31.712
Okay, let's take ten.

1:12:39.941 --> 1:12:42.303
Look, he just wanted to mark it
and asked me to step up, okay?

1:12:43.223 --> 1:12:44.433
I overslept.

1:12:45.391 --> 1:12:48.133
Oops. But hey, at least
you had a good time, right?

1:12:48.174 --> 1:12:49.814
You put something in my drink.

1:12:49.843 --> 1:12:51.643
Yeah.

1:12:51.673 --> 1:12:53.345
And then you just
took off in the morning.

1:12:54.805 --> 1:12:55.525
In the morning?

1:12:55.565 --> 1:12:57.495
Yeah, you slept over.

1:13:00.056 --> 1:13:00.916
Um, no.

1:13:02.665 --> 1:13:05.317
Unless your name's Tom
and you had a dick.

1:13:07.915 --> 1:13:08.945
What, Nina?

1:13:14.667 --> 1:13:17.999
Did you have some sort of
lesbian wet dream about me?

1:13:18.029 --> 1:13:20.429
- Stop.
- Oh my God!

1:13:20.467 --> 1:13:23.779
Oh my God, you did!
You fantasized about me!

1:13:23.799 --> 1:13:26.219
- Shut up!
- Was I good?

1:15:09.446 --> 1:15:11.666
The final act.

1:15:11.665 --> 1:15:13.655
You're trying to dance.

1:15:16.037 --> 1:15:19.277
You've tasted your dream!
Touched it!

1:15:21.538 --> 1:15:23.638
Only to have it crushed!

1:15:26.986 --> 1:15:28.728
Your heart is broken,

1:15:28.769 --> 1:15:32.089
wounded.
Your life force fading.

1:15:32.127 --> 1:15:35.809
The blood drips.

1:15:37.808 --> 1:15:42.060
The Black Swan stole your love.
There is only one way to end the pain.

1:15:44.199 --> 1:15:47.701
You are not fearful,
but filled with acceptance.

1:15:49.950 --> 1:15:52.962
And you look down at Rothbart,

1:15:52.962 --> 1:15:54.082
and then at the Prince,

1:15:56.140 --> 1:15:59.192
and then, yes,
at the audience.

1:15:59.233 --> 1:16:02.323
And then you jump.

1:16:05.913 --> 1:16:07.973
Go ahead. Jump.
Jump!

1:16:19.234 --> 1:16:22.346
Okay, everybody get a drink of water,
then it's notes.

1:16:34.548 --> 1:16:35.738
You lost weight.

1:16:35.778 --> 1:16:37.388
Take off your shrug, please.

1:16:49.129 --> 1:16:49.879
Very good.

1:16:56.652 --> 1:16:58.142
Face front.
We're almost done.

1:17:02.404 --> 1:17:04.424
And that's it.
Okay.

1:17:04.453 --> 1:17:06.553
We're done.
Thank you very much.

1:17:09.304 --> 1:17:11.964
Georgina, I'm Lily.
Thomas sent me...

1:17:11.993 --> 1:17:14.805
Yes, we have to get you measured
for the Swan Queen costumes.

1:17:14.835 --> 1:17:15.965
What's she doing here?

1:17:18.123 --> 1:17:19.523
He made me your alternate.

1:17:21.646 --> 1:17:22.676
Look, it's just in case.

1:17:25.315 --> 1:17:27.797
Thomas.
Thomas.

1:17:27.817 --> 1:17:28.927
- Thomas.
- Yes?

1:17:28.956 --> 1:17:31.076
It can't be her.

1:17:31.115 --> 1:17:32.977
It can't be her.

1:17:33.007 --> 1:17:34.497
Okay, why don't you just go.
I'll catch up later.

1:17:34.527 --> 1:17:36.277
What's going on?

1:17:36.307 --> 1:17:39.349
Lily...
You made her my alternate?

1:17:40.887 --> 1:17:43.639
There's always an alternate.
Lily is the best choice.

1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:45.080
No, she wants my role.

1:17:45.109 --> 1:17:47.449
Every dancer in the world
wants your role.

1:17:47.479 --> 1:17:49.981
No, this is different.
She is after me.

1:17:50.011 --> 1:17:53.431
- She is trying to replace me.
- Nobody is after you.

1:17:53.469 --> 1:17:56.311
- No, please believe me...

1:17:58.861 --> 1:18:04.183
I know it's been a struggle.
But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

1:18:05.951 --> 1:18:10.583
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance
and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

1:18:14.204 --> 1:18:15.214
Now go home and rest.

1:18:29.014 --> 1:18:30.934
From the vision again.

1:18:48.507 --> 1:18:49.069
What happened?

1:18:51.180 --> 1:18:55.162
I've got a life. I work too hard.
It's a big day tomorrow.

1:19:39.956 --> 1:19:41.246
I'm still working in here.

1:19:51.767 --> 1:19:53.257
Could you please
turn the lights back on?

1:19:59.408 --> 1:19:59.858
Hello?

1:21:48.187 --> 1:21:49.277
What are you doing here?

1:21:49.307 --> 1:21:51.217
I'm so sorry.

1:21:51.245 --> 1:21:53.547
I'm so sorry.

1:21:53.588 --> 1:21:58.158
I know how it feels now.
She's trying to replace me.

1:21:59.409 --> 1:22:00.779
What do I do?

1:22:02.837 --> 1:22:05.219
You stole my things?

1:22:05.250 --> 1:22:07.890
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

1:22:10.738 --> 1:22:11.480
Perfect?

1:22:17.401 --> 1:22:18.631
I'm not perfect.

1:22:21.210 --> 1:22:22.130
I'm nothing.

1:22:25.092 --> 1:22:27.692
Nothing!

1:22:36.604 --> 1:22:37.904
Nothing, nothing!

1:23:24.961 --> 1:23:25.841
Sweet girl.

1:23:47.265 --> 1:23:47.745
Mommy?

1:23:53.126 --> 1:23:54.466
Sweet girl.
Sweet girl.

1:23:58.397 --> 1:24:00.627
Stop!

1:24:09.406 --> 1:24:10.288
What are you doing?

1:24:13.077 --> 1:24:13.697
Sweetie?

1:24:20.958 --> 1:24:22.170
Nina?

1:24:22.211 --> 1:24:23.961
Nina!

1:24:23.990 --> 1:24:25.260
Go away!

1:24:26.759 --> 1:24:27.711
Open the door!

1:24:27.751 --> 1:24:28.941
Go away!

1:24:37.751 --> 1:24:39.523
Open the door, Nina!

1:24:40.263 --> 1:24:41.663
Nina!

1:24:54.404 --> 1:24:54.974
Get out!

1:24:55.004 --> 1:24:57.246
- What's wrong with you?
- Get out!

1:24:57.287 --> 1:24:59.287
- Get out!
- What do you see?

1:24:59.326 --> 1:25:00.996
Get out!

1:25:39.772 --> 1:25:40.902
It's okay.

1:25:42.162 --> 1:25:43.012
I'm here.

1:25:47.083 --> 1:25:49.493
You were scratching all night.

1:25:49.532 --> 1:25:51.794
Where's my clock?

1:25:51.834 --> 1:25:54.124
- Don't worry about that.
- What time is it?

1:25:55.103 --> 1:25:57.405
- The show is tonight, I have to...
- No, no, no, no.

1:25:57.415 --> 1:25:58.695
Don't worry.

1:25:58.735 --> 1:26:01.715
I called the theater and I told them
you aren't feeling well.

1:26:01.743 --> 1:26:02.855
I have to go!

1:26:02.886 --> 1:26:04.446
- No. No, you don't.
- Let go of me.

1:26:07.435 --> 1:26:09.177
You're staying in here
until you feel better.

1:26:09.217 --> 1:26:10.697
Where is it?

1:26:12.395 --> 1:26:14.115
This role is destroying you.

1:26:15.808 --> 1:26:17.408
- Move. Move!
- Nina...!

1:26:17.437 --> 1:26:20.859
- What happened to my sweet girl?
- She's gone!

1:26:21.589 --> 1:26:23.869
Nina!
Oh, Nina!

1:26:24.827 --> 1:26:25.617
No, please!

1:26:25.647 --> 1:26:27.779
- You're not well!
- Let go of me!

1:26:27.819 --> 1:26:29.489
You can't handle this.

1:26:29.519 --> 1:26:31.349
I can't?

1:26:31.388 --> 1:26:34.430
I'm the Swan Queen.
You're the one who never left the corps.

1:26:36.009 --> 1:26:36.759
Nina!

1:26:53.232 --> 1:26:54.032
What are you doing here?

1:26:54.062 --> 1:26:55.292
Nina?

1:26:55.332 --> 1:26:57.234
She was supposed to be sick.

1:26:57.274 --> 1:26:58.924
Give us a minute.

1:27:04.315 --> 1:27:04.865
Are you okay?

1:27:04.904 --> 1:27:06.334
I'm fine.

1:27:09.626 --> 1:27:11.616
Nina.

1:27:13.394 --> 1:27:14.646
Nina.

1:27:14.677 --> 1:27:15.747
What?

1:27:15.786 --> 1:27:18.466
I've already asked Lily.

1:27:18.496 --> 1:27:20.448
Have you announced it?

1:27:24.236 --> 1:27:26.528
After Beth, do you really need
another controversy?

1:27:30.987 --> 1:27:32.599
I'm here, Thomas.

1:27:32.630 --> 1:27:34.100
I'm doing it.

1:27:40.310 --> 1:27:42.700
The only person
standing in your way is you.

1:27:42.739 --> 1:27:47.391
It's time to let it go.
Lose yourself.

1:28:02.544 --> 1:28:04.144
White Swan, up in ten.

1:28:58.101 --> 1:28:59.821
What are you doing?
You need to be upstage.

1:31:01.161 --> 1:31:02.061
You suck.

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.080
Okay, Nina.

1:31:44.197 --> 1:31:44.897
What the fuck?

1:32:30.095 --> 1:32:31.985
- Are you okay?
- Nina, are you okay?

1:32:41.527 --> 1:32:42.827
Can you tell me
what the fuck happened?

1:32:46.588 --> 1:32:48.428
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
- This is a fucking disaster.

1:32:56.697 --> 1:33:00.209
Rough start, huh?
Must have been pretty humiliating.

1:33:02.079 --> 1:33:03.289
Get out of my room.

1:33:03.318 --> 1:33:05.740
I'm worried about the next act.

1:33:07.639 --> 1:33:09.499
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

1:33:09.529 --> 1:33:11.031
Stop.
Please stop.

1:33:11.071 --> 1:33:16.323
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

1:33:18.602 --> 1:33:21.082
Leave me alone!

1:33:33.052 --> 1:33:33.682
My turn!

1:33:34.645 --> 1:33:35.305
My turn!

1:33:35.335 --> 1:33:37.085
My turn!

1:33:44.214 --> 1:33:45.896
It's my turn!

1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:06.980
Black Swan, places in five.

1:37:09.847 --> 1:37:11.727
Come on.

1:37:39.422 --> 1:37:41.242
Good job.
Fifteen to the last act.

1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:30.090
Hey.
You were amazing.

1:38:30.128 --> 1:38:33.850
Seriously, I know that things got
a little messed up between us,

1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:37.292
but I mean, holy shit,
you completely blew me away!

1:38:39.990 --> 1:38:41.920
Okay, well I guess that's it.

1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:43.702
So I'll let you finish.
Bye.

1:42:08.382 --> 1:42:09.472
Can you hear them?

1:42:09.512 --> 1:42:12.214
They love you!

1:42:12.254 --> 1:42:15.944
My little princess,
I always knew you had it in you.

1:42:15.972 --> 1:42:18.594
Come on.
Let's take you out.

1:42:24.826 --> 1:42:25.576
Go get some help.

1:42:25.605 --> 1:42:26.575
Go get some help!

1:42:26.605 --> 1:42:28.035
What did you do?

1:42:28.074 --> 1:42:29.196
What did you do?

1:42:29.237 --> 1:42:33.387
- I felt it.
- What?

1:42:33.426 --> 1:42:35.708
I felt perfect.

1:42:41.019 --> 1:42:42.719
I was perfect.

1:42:55.200 --> 1:42:57.540
Nina! Nina! Nina!
