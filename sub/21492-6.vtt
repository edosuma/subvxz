00:09.690 --> 00:11.663
<i>Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...</i>

00:11.701 --> 00:13.489
When this art center opens,

00:13.552 --> 00:15.187
there will be more
Supreme Electronix stores.

00:15.211 --> 00:17.489
And those stores will need managers.

00:17.537 --> 00:19.727
Corporate's coming in next week
and they want to meet a candidate.

00:19.751 --> 00:22.252
- Are you up for this?
- I think I am.

00:22.253 --> 00:24.665
She said you called the press.

00:24.736 --> 00:26.856
The whole town hated her after that.

00:26.857 --> 00:28.224
- Get him out of here!
- Please.

00:28.225 --> 00:29.743
- Get him out!
- Please. Go.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.195
You helped him kill her, too!

00:37.067 --> 00:40.403
Aw, yeah. I got you a treat.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.476
Shit.

00:46.477 --> 00:47.745
Fuck! Fuck!

00:48.746 --> 00:50.499
<i>After all, a man needs a quest in life.</i>

00:50.524 --> 00:52.324
<i>Like, after I'm gone,</i>

00:52.349 --> 00:54.552
<i>I mean, what would you do,
besides Mommy?</i>

00:54.577 --> 00:56.227
<i>Shut your fucking mouth!</i>

01:00.291 --> 01:02.425
Mom, please!

02:46.763 --> 02:50.294
You're in here somewhere, little man,

02:50.558 --> 02:52.092
and I will find you.

05:19.128 --> 05:21.330
You take note of every day?

05:22.665 --> 05:24.133
Not every day.

05:25.488 --> 05:27.556
You should.

05:31.140 --> 05:33.423
You needed to be heard last night,

05:33.901 --> 05:36.431
but you got petulance instead.

05:40.210 --> 05:45.194
I was so concerned
with my bruised dignity,

05:45.754 --> 05:48.004
I acted undignified myself.

05:48.805 --> 05:51.484
You're the most dignified
human being I've ever met.

05:53.028 --> 05:55.097
And yet it's still not enough.

06:06.942 --> 06:08.991
Mom.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.208
Mom.

06:16.719 --> 06:18.663
Mom, I need your help a sec.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.640
You can fall right back asleep.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.124
Mom.

06:23.394 --> 06:24.729
I need your help with a tie.

07:02.565 --> 07:04.033
Fuck.

08:27.149 --> 08:29.940
<i>Hi. This... this is Deb.
Leave a message.</i>

08:29.965 --> 08:32.076
Mom, call me.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.112
Kenneth Brock?

09:45.144 --> 09:47.729
I'm Bill Hodges.
I'm a private investigator.

09:48.977 --> 09:50.477
Yeah.

09:50.564 --> 09:52.900
I'm investigating
a series of car breakins

09:52.901 --> 09:55.121
happened about two and a half years ago.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.939
You're the first person,
to the best of my knowledge,

09:57.940 --> 09:59.343
filed a police report.

09:59.629 --> 10:02.595
Some prick moved my car, okay, twice.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.135
First time, I was parked over there.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.509
Next time, I was parked there.

10:05.534 --> 10:07.749
Found the car a block over both times.

10:08.032 --> 10:10.048
Why you asking about it now?

10:10.739 --> 10:12.681
Client with money and
too much time on her hands

10:12.706 --> 10:14.185
wants me to get him.

10:17.026 --> 10:18.559
Nice gig.

10:18.683 --> 10:20.255
Yeah. Exciting, right?

10:22.498 --> 10:25.767
In my experience,
early victims of serial crimes

10:25.768 --> 10:27.497
often know the perpetrator.

10:27.665 --> 10:29.566
You got enemies
who might have done this?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.719
My enemies would have keyed the damn car

10:31.744 --> 10:33.224
or thrown a brick through the window.

10:36.245 --> 10:37.478
How about this street?

10:37.479 --> 10:40.315
Anyone you know kind of, you know, odd?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.773
Dude three houses down beats his dogs.

10:43.798 --> 10:45.766
Lady across the street's a drunk.

10:45.877 --> 10:48.589
Mrs. Cooper fakes her disability.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.711
A guy I'm not gonna name sells crystal,

10:50.736 --> 10:53.212
and Donnie Snyder's got
enough garbage in his yard,

10:53.237 --> 10:55.239
the rats come out in broad day light.

10:56.671 --> 10:58.038
You know?

10:58.333 --> 10:59.634
This guy who beats his dog?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.528
He was in Iraq both times
my car got moved.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.474
All right. Thanks for your time.

11:07.243 --> 11:09.703
They fucking repo'd
the thing, anyway, man.

11:17.463 --> 11:19.220
Hey.

11:19.574 --> 11:21.833
<i>My mother's had a stroke.</i>

11:22.364 --> 11:24.071
I'm on my way.

11:25.174 --> 11:28.356
So, this is the deal.

11:29.164 --> 11:31.200
They'll bump me
to the big store in Waynesville.

11:31.526 --> 11:34.368
Six months later,
I'll be promoted to D.M.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.637
But you got to bring game
to this meeting, Brady.

11:36.638 --> 11:38.741
They got to believe in your ability
to take over and fill my shoes.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.299
Are you on it?

11:40.442 --> 11:42.880
- I'm on it.
- All right.

11:43.112 --> 11:44.979
My dad used to tie my ties.

11:44.980 --> 11:46.581
That knot is called a Plattsburgh.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.383
It's one of the few knots
you can tie in reverse.

11:49.384 --> 11:51.587
You know, inside out.

12:08.364 --> 12:10.738
Okay. Okay.

12:40.004 --> 12:41.254
Deb?

12:44.239 --> 12:46.307
Deborah Ann Hartsfield.

12:46.952 --> 12:49.071
Chaz Chapman.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.938
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.185
You look terrific.

12:54.449 --> 12:56.183
So do you.

12:56.272 --> 12:58.668
Nah. Come on. I've put on
a couple pounds. You know.

12:58.693 --> 12:59.827
Who hasn't?

12:59.852 --> 13:01.589
Well, you!

13:01.590 --> 13:03.324
My God, you look exactly the same.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.458
Aww.

13:05.109 --> 13:07.378
So what brings you here?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.967
Thinking about getting
your old job back?

13:12.267 --> 13:13.401
Well, that would be great

13:13.402 --> 13:15.086
'cause then we'd be neighbors again.

13:15.270 --> 13:17.484
You're still bartending at Four Leaf?

13:17.609 --> 13:19.343
No, no, no. I bought the place.

13:19.408 --> 13:22.343
Yeah, me and Bub Minton
and Eddie Chinetti.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.344
Yeah.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.856
We're making a go of it when we can...

13:24.880 --> 13:26.571
keep from drinking the inventory.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.351
Well, that's great.

13:31.529 --> 13:34.932
Um, look, I should get in there so...

13:34.957 --> 13:38.777
You know, um, Jaime comes in
usually every night.

13:38.802 --> 13:41.496
I could... I could mention
you're getting back in the game.

13:42.631 --> 13:44.432
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.810
That would be... That would be great.

13:47.278 --> 13:50.744
- That's how the best things happen.
- Right.

13:51.117 --> 13:53.935
Look, I was just going to grab a bite.
You hungry?

13:54.826 --> 13:56.761
Come on. You...
You can go in after, all right?

13:56.786 --> 13:58.045
Come on.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.647
I am hungry.

13:59.648 --> 14:00.781
Come on.

14:00.782 --> 14:02.850
- Okay.
- Great.

14:02.851 --> 14:05.763
God, you look fantastic.

14:09.591 --> 14:10.992
Your chariot.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.131
My sister had a stroke.

14:17.466 --> 14:19.472
My sister.

14:20.179 --> 14:21.987
A stroke.

14:22.692 --> 14:25.161
That's why we're here, Aunt Charlotte.

14:25.274 --> 14:26.864
Strokes don't run in our family.

14:27.009 --> 14:28.586
Hold out your hand.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.142
Hospitals are filthy places.

14:31.346 --> 14:33.761
Perfect for them if we get sick
while we're here.

14:33.864 --> 14:35.283
More money in their pocket.

14:35.864 --> 14:37.261
Racket.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.827
I think that policeman caused this.

14:47.272 --> 14:49.406
- What?
- He was questioning her.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.232
That wouldn't cause a stroke.

14:51.233 --> 14:55.416
- Are you a stroke expert?
- He... He didn't cause a stroke.

14:58.620 --> 14:59.954
Why would you invite him here?

15:00.303 --> 15:02.037
He's a friend.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.304
That's what they call it these days?

15:10.356 --> 15:12.021
My pen ran out.

15:12.046 --> 15:14.902
I'm in the middle of something,
so ask your father for his pen.

15:14.927 --> 15:16.657
He doesn't have a black rollerball.

15:16.658 --> 15:17.992
He's using a blue ballpoint.

15:17.993 --> 15:20.635
And you know that I can't
possibly switch pens

15:20.660 --> 15:21.730
in the middle of a journal entry,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.532
especially not to a blue ballpoint.

15:32.889 --> 15:35.055
I'm still pissed at you.

15:35.607 --> 15:37.609
Is that for me?

15:42.635 --> 15:44.746
Just so you know, everybody's
a little bit on edge.

15:44.794 --> 15:47.111
That's a nice word for it.

15:47.545 --> 15:49.212
Well, it's a crisis.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.919
They'd be on edge if it was a good day.

15:52.497 --> 15:55.499
Aunt Charlotte,
this is my friend, Bill Hodges.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.765
- Pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
- Likewise.

15:58.798 --> 15:59.908
Uncle Art.

15:59.933 --> 16:02.393
- Art Gibney.
- Bill Hodges. How are you?

16:02.418 --> 16:03.593
Holly.

16:03.618 --> 16:05.942
My fingers are hurting, and I'd
really like to uncover my ears.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.537
Holly, you're at a seven,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.258
and you need to bring it down to a five.

16:09.283 --> 16:10.623
May I please have my pen now?

16:10.648 --> 16:12.914
Not when you use that tone.

16:13.796 --> 16:15.253
Charlotte.

16:15.278 --> 16:18.447
Someone needs to work on their
emotionalregulation skills.

16:19.321 --> 16:21.097
I'm gonna go check on her.

16:21.256 --> 16:23.716
I'd prefer you not indulge her.

16:23.787 --> 16:26.055
Mrs. Patterson? Dr. Wells.

16:26.351 --> 16:28.565
- I can go and check on her.
- Okay.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.508
I'm Charlotte Gibney.
I'm Elizabeth's sister.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.767
I have some updates
on your mother's condition.

16:40.312 --> 16:43.115
- How y'all doing?
- Good.

16:48.917 --> 16:51.072
- Shoot.
- Sorry.

16:51.294 --> 16:52.896
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:54.489 --> 16:56.757
Please don't tell my mom I was smoking.

16:57.022 --> 16:58.225
II used to be a smoker,

16:58.226 --> 17:00.625
but I'm not anymore because I quit.

17:00.829 --> 17:03.697
I get it. I was a smoker for years myself.

17:04.038 --> 17:06.574
Years and years. Pack a day.

17:08.497 --> 17:10.940
- Okay.
- Actually...

17:12.171 --> 17:14.242
if it's just between us,

17:14.393 --> 17:15.972
you think maybe I could bum one?

17:18.294 --> 17:20.430
SSure.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.696
You mind if I sit?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.310
Thanks.

17:31.421 --> 17:32.621
Thanks.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.906
I've missed these.

17:41.579 --> 17:43.974
I wonder why people
who are about to be born

17:43.999 --> 17:45.031
but aren't born yet

17:45.056 --> 17:47.675
and people who are about to die
but aren't dead yet

17:47.896 --> 17:51.179
all go to the same place
to do what they're about to do

17:51.480 --> 17:53.750
when death is the opposite of birth.

17:56.469 --> 17:59.671
Is it because both things
make people cry so much?

17:59.997 --> 18:02.999
Which would explain why
I don't like hospitals

18:03.024 --> 18:05.943
because I really don't
like it when people cry.

18:06.761 --> 18:08.629
WWhen my best friend got killed,

18:08.630 --> 18:12.179
I didn't even go to her funeral
because of all the crying people.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.103
And because I wouldn't have
been able to sit next to her.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.907
You all right?

18:21.710 --> 18:23.499
Can I do anything?

18:24.904 --> 18:26.832
Mnh.

18:27.182 --> 18:29.188
Before my cousin Ollie got killed,

18:29.213 --> 18:31.719
shshe was the only person
that I really talked to

18:31.720 --> 18:33.066
because she was my best friend,

18:33.091 --> 18:35.389
but she always sat across
from me when we talked,

18:35.390 --> 18:37.384
never to my right or left.

18:37.496 --> 18:40.522
And I have been looking at you
to the left of me

18:40.547 --> 18:41.918
because I know how important

18:41.943 --> 18:44.574
eye contact is in social situations.

18:44.599 --> 18:47.188
But now,
the... the right side of my neck

18:47.213 --> 18:49.203
feels much longer
than the left side of my neck,

18:49.204 --> 18:51.891
and my left side feels left out,

18:52.814 --> 18:55.151
so I'm gonna have to turn my head

18:55.176 --> 18:57.042
and look the other way for while.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.835
Okay.

19:07.624 --> 19:11.275
We can still keep talking, though.
I mean, I can hear you like this.

19:22.479 --> 19:25.148
Getting sort of tired sitting
in the same place, anyway.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.114
You mind if I ask you a question?

19:35.992 --> 19:38.301
Unfortunately, there's just
no way I can answer that

19:38.326 --> 19:40.739
without knowing what your question is.

19:40.858 --> 19:41.990
Fair enough.

19:44.376 --> 19:46.602
Your cousin Olivia,

19:46.928 --> 19:48.930
why did you say she was killed?

19:51.793 --> 19:53.868
I do mind that question, yes.

19:57.138 --> 19:59.163
Are you upset with me?

19:59.341 --> 20:00.531
Not at all.

20:00.556 --> 20:01.890
You're so big.

20:36.044 --> 20:37.603
Who picked her up?

20:37.846 --> 20:39.452
That's the bad news.

20:39.785 --> 20:41.626
Boo Bear Durkin pulled her over.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.720
Fuck.

20:45.816 --> 20:48.819
Well, at least
she's in our yard this time.

20:50.392 --> 20:51.926
And he booked her.

20:58.933 --> 21:01.112
She'll be processed.

21:01.670 --> 21:04.779
She was clocked
doing 68 on Seaver Street.

21:05.073 --> 21:07.466
She blew a 0.18.

21:26.961 --> 21:29.096
Don't know about you,
but I'm getting a bit hungry.

21:29.626 --> 21:30.893
You think maybe we could go

21:30.918 --> 21:32.466
and get a sandwich for everybody?

21:32.725 --> 21:35.299
I know a really great place
not far from here.

21:36.037 --> 21:38.706
Do I have to ask my mom?

21:39.307 --> 21:41.077
Nah.

21:41.237 --> 21:43.305
If she gets upset, I'll take the blame.

21:43.378 --> 21:44.913
Okay.

21:45.847 --> 21:48.387
Ooh. Is that creamed corn down there?

21:54.719 --> 21:56.390
Sorry we're late. Traffic. Josh.

21:56.391 --> 21:57.591
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

21:57.592 --> 21:59.193
Hi, Jake.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.828
This is my man, Brady Hartsfield.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.796
- Jacob.
- Jacob. Jacob.

22:02.797 --> 22:05.361
- How are you?
- Hey. Josh. Good to meet you.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.718
We're on a hard stop for
this lunch, so let's dive in.

22:07.742 --> 22:11.575
So far, we understand your
swim lane is computer repair.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.329
But why don't you
open the kimono for us,

22:14.359 --> 22:15.676
go beyond your vertical?

22:15.708 --> 22:17.077
Don't boil the ocean or anything,

22:17.078 --> 22:18.813
but, yeah, let's talk that.

22:20.860 --> 22:22.312
Well, what would you say

22:22.337 --> 22:24.059
your core management philosophy is?

22:26.710 --> 22:29.186
My core management philosophy?

22:29.305 --> 22:30.693
You have one, right?

22:33.561 --> 22:35.590
I have one. Yes.

22:43.543 --> 22:45.611
It's all about responsibility.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.174
How so?

22:48.356 --> 22:50.348
Tell them.

22:58.329 --> 23:01.393
People have forgotten
there's an expectation

23:01.556 --> 23:03.250
on how they're supposed to behave.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.050
There are rules.
There's an understanding.

23:07.795 --> 23:10.864
What's that understanding, Brady?

23:15.487 --> 23:17.376
That...

23:31.703 --> 23:33.849
That's, um...

24:09.657 --> 24:13.584
That if we pay them and we train them

24:13.687 --> 24:16.052
and we clean up their messes,

24:16.598 --> 24:19.375
- they have to perform.
- Perform...?

24:20.455 --> 24:22.923
Look. A manager's...

24:23.042 --> 24:27.209
I think a manager's job is to manage

24:27.621 --> 24:29.828
how employees under him

24:30.011 --> 24:32.662
best represent the company's objective.

24:33.481 --> 24:35.082
Can you drill down on that?

24:35.083 --> 24:37.789
Yeah. Um, there's just been enough.

24:37.844 --> 24:41.086
- Enough what?
- Enough.

24:41.126 --> 24:44.601
Like, not doing right
by the company's standard,

24:44.626 --> 24:47.388
and I've just... It's... I'm just...

24:49.207 --> 24:50.875
I've had enough.

24:53.417 --> 24:57.238
Some frickin' order
needs to be restored.

24:58.239 --> 24:59.307
Yep.

25:04.741 --> 25:06.913
I'm just gonna use the men's. Okay?

25:07.183 --> 25:08.718
Of course.

25:10.852 --> 25:14.137
He sometimes gets
low blood sugar and...

25:17.773 --> 25:20.463
- Fuck.
- Brady?

25:21.596 --> 25:23.530
- Brady Hartsfield.
- Yup.

25:23.531 --> 25:24.870
Brady, come on.

25:24.895 --> 25:26.496
Yes. Coming.

25:29.937 --> 25:31.738
What did you do out there?

25:31.739 --> 25:32.973
What do you mean?

25:32.974 --> 25:34.887
Nobody had a clue what you were
fucking talking about!

25:34.911 --> 25:36.410
- They left!
- Could you not ple...

25:36.435 --> 25:38.345
I don't like the word "fuck."
Could you not?

25:38.346 --> 25:40.814
Fuck, okay? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

25:40.815 --> 25:43.402
You fuckity fuckity fuckface!

25:43.551 --> 25:46.059
You fucked yourself, and you fucked me

25:46.084 --> 25:47.592
because if they can't replace me,

25:47.617 --> 25:48.884
they can't promote me!

25:49.403 --> 25:50.536
- Bummer.
- Bum...

25:51.826 --> 25:53.361
Fuck!

26:09.063 --> 26:10.833
My mother's missing.

26:12.380 --> 26:13.680
What?

26:13.759 --> 26:16.183
She left the house
and she won't answer her phone

26:16.184 --> 26:17.457
and now she's gone.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.816
And ever since my brother died,

26:23.841 --> 26:27.060
she hasn't been all there, you know?

26:27.061 --> 26:29.889
- You had a brother who died?
- Yeah.

26:30.332 --> 26:32.000
When we were kids,

26:32.200 --> 26:33.938
he, um...

26:36.128 --> 26:38.605
choked on an apple and fell down stairs.

26:38.606 --> 26:40.184
My God.

26:40.408 --> 26:43.763
So she started drinking,
and she didn't stop.

26:45.390 --> 26:47.636
She took the car. I had to take the bus.

26:47.668 --> 26:49.750
I should have called in sick,
but I couldn't

26:49.751 --> 26:52.142
today of all days. And...

26:53.181 --> 26:55.633
now she's out there,
and she shouldn't be.

26:55.658 --> 26:57.724
Okay. Brady, chill.

26:57.749 --> 27:00.511
All right? Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.696
I knew about your mother
and the booze, sure.

27:02.697 --> 27:05.219
But II didn't know you had a brother.

27:06.323 --> 27:08.178
Hey. Look.

27:08.203 --> 27:10.437
My mother bailed when I was 2.

27:10.584 --> 27:12.595
Never knew her.

27:13.374 --> 27:15.024
My old man, he's...

27:15.825 --> 27:17.229
I see him every weekend.

27:18.008 --> 27:20.187
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to him.

27:20.212 --> 27:22.942
He's... my everything.

27:26.754 --> 27:28.655
God. Brady.

27:28.976 --> 27:31.058
You shouldn't have come in today.

27:34.468 --> 27:36.393
All right. Let's...

27:36.512 --> 27:38.290
We'll find another candidate.

27:38.451 --> 27:40.134
But you need to find your mom.

27:40.877 --> 27:43.337
I'm afraid of what else you could
fuck up today if you don't.

27:43.377 --> 27:44.672
Yeah.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.857
I, um...

27:50.583 --> 27:52.325
I don't have a car.

27:52.853 --> 27:54.603
Shit.

27:56.484 --> 27:58.351
I'll drop you at the store.

27:58.493 --> 28:00.120
Take a Brain Buds van.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.945
Make sure there's no equipment
in it anyone can steal,

28:02.993 --> 28:05.693
and don't ever tell anyone
I let you do this.

28:06.842 --> 28:08.070
Thank you so much.

28:08.095 --> 28:09.836
You owe me big time.

28:10.706 --> 28:12.383
Big time.

28:12.576 --> 28:13.977
Dry your eyes.

28:23.341 --> 28:24.852
- Any more snow.
- I'll have to shovel it.

28:24.876 --> 28:27.336
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:27.392 --> 28:28.649
I'll have another one, thank you.

28:28.650 --> 28:30.317
Sure. You still fine with water?

28:30.722 --> 28:32.055
I am.

28:34.856 --> 28:36.923
So you still seeing that,

28:37.012 --> 28:38.850
that guy who sells motorcycle parts?

28:38.890 --> 28:40.927
Ronnie Ames?

28:40.928 --> 28:42.996
That was a thousand years ago.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.247
You... You still married to Carol?

28:47.366 --> 28:48.402
What?

28:48.403 --> 28:50.737
No, no.

28:50.788 --> 28:52.272
No, I pulled the plug on that.

28:52.661 --> 28:55.328
No, I got remarried.

28:55.476 --> 28:58.002
Doreen Ploof. Remember Doreen Ploof?

28:58.209 --> 29:00.435
- Doreen, yeah.
- Yeah, works at Hutchins?

29:00.460 --> 29:01.897
Yeah.

29:02.016 --> 29:05.341
Wait. Wasn't her daughter in that...

29:05.540 --> 29:07.643
No. Sister. It was her sister.

29:07.683 --> 29:11.099
Her sister. Thank God.

29:13.726 --> 29:17.097
II mean, not thank God,
you know, but...

29:17.098 --> 29:18.670
- It's...
- You know what I mean.

29:18.695 --> 29:20.300
I know what you mean. It's okay.

29:20.301 --> 29:25.497
It's just... It's losing anybody
to that sick...

29:25.584 --> 29:27.774
Maniac. Piece of shit maniac.

29:27.822 --> 29:30.037
It's bad enough...

29:30.672 --> 29:32.815
But you never get over losing a child.

29:32.958 --> 29:34.581
Doreen certainly had a hard time

29:34.582 --> 29:36.116
getting over her sister.

29:36.117 --> 29:37.654
Well, maybe if they'd have
caught the guy...

29:37.678 --> 29:39.579
- How could they not?
- Yeah.

29:40.092 --> 29:42.425
He was driving around that big Mercedes.

29:42.590 --> 29:46.417
It's covered with blood
and stuff all over it.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.662
- And just drives away, right?
- Yeah.

29:48.747 --> 29:52.255
Tears the heart out of this town
and then just drives away.

29:53.144 --> 29:55.334
You know, no one cares.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.561
That's why they didn't catch him.

29:57.808 --> 30:00.435
I mean, who are we to anybody, right?

30:00.629 --> 30:02.364
Just people they fly over.

30:05.613 --> 30:07.046
Hey.

30:10.146 --> 30:11.481
I get feelings.

30:13.572 --> 30:15.206
I mean, not visions,

30:15.775 --> 30:20.367
but, like, prophecy feelings, you know?

30:21.271 --> 30:25.526
And I've been getting this
really strong feeling lately

30:25.629 --> 30:28.215
that he's gonna be caught.

30:28.453 --> 30:31.922
And I don't just feel it, I know it,

30:32.677 --> 30:35.613
so tell Doreen they'll catch him soon.

31:03.605 --> 31:05.706
These smell delish!

31:06.128 --> 31:07.396
Get in there, then.

31:09.360 --> 31:12.274
- Now? While we're driving?
- Yeah.

31:12.942 --> 31:14.943
But I can't. What if I spill?

31:15.229 --> 31:17.231
We've got napkins.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.996
Go for it. Come on.

31:23.491 --> 31:25.359
Okay.

31:39.425 --> 31:40.717
Good?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.987
It was the voices.

31:55.468 --> 31:57.402
That... That killed Ollie.

31:57.503 --> 32:00.059
I don't mind telling you now.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.063
I tried so hard to hear them,

32:03.064 --> 32:04.820
but Ollie said that they knew
that I was listening,

32:04.844 --> 32:06.225
and so they'd whisper.

32:06.963 --> 32:08.455
Yeah.

32:09.348 --> 32:12.257
They whispered a lot, but
sometimes, they'd also scream.

32:18.279 --> 32:19.747
I'm not crazy.

32:21.499 --> 32:23.234
I don't think you're crazy at all.

32:32.344 --> 32:34.009
And I know that the voices were real

32:34.034 --> 32:36.665
because Ollie didn't make things up.

32:36.690 --> 32:37.897
I mean, she didn't know how.

32:37.898 --> 32:40.118
I mean, that's why
she had to take pills.

32:40.234 --> 32:41.799
She said that most people can pretend

32:41.824 --> 32:43.324
that things are better
than they really are,

32:43.348 --> 32:44.468
and that's why they're happy.

32:44.492 --> 32:46.850
But because she didn't
know how to pretend,

32:46.875 --> 32:49.328
she needed pills to do
the pretending for her.

32:50.507 --> 32:53.650
And she still wasn't happy,
but at least she wasn't sad.

32:55.732 --> 32:57.621
Yeah.

32:59.009 --> 33:00.540
Yeah, but then she stopped taking them

33:00.565 --> 33:02.693
'cause she said that the voices
kept telling her

33:02.718 --> 33:03.961
she was living a lie,

33:03.986 --> 33:05.726
taking the pills
that helped her pretend.

33:08.596 --> 33:10.376
Thanks.

33:12.138 --> 33:14.272
She say anything else you can remember?

33:14.479 --> 33:16.344
It really helps.

33:17.424 --> 33:18.625
Helps with what?

33:18.963 --> 33:22.009
Catching whoever pushed her
to kill herself.

33:27.432 --> 33:30.659
That's the problem. That's the problem.

33:30.684 --> 33:32.783
That's why we had a problem.

33:35.070 --> 33:37.673
- You're crazy.
- It's not so bad.

33:38.371 --> 33:40.193
You know, I was remembering this morning

33:40.194 --> 33:42.427
how we used to go to Gunner's
Quarry back in the day.

33:42.452 --> 33:43.919
Yeah.

33:44.098 --> 33:46.732
You were going with Heather Myers.
I was with Norm.

33:46.757 --> 33:49.302
- Yeah. Well, of course you were.
- Of course.

33:52.039 --> 33:54.174
Hey, can you do me a favor
and grab that bag behind me?

33:54.175 --> 33:56.561
Sure. Here.

33:56.633 --> 33:58.347
No, no, no. Unzip it.

34:00.915 --> 34:04.385
- They had that old tire swing.
- Yes.

34:11.391 --> 34:13.329
I just need the bottle.

34:18.349 --> 34:21.268
The rest is is for later.

34:27.322 --> 34:29.257
You want some of this?

34:29.309 --> 34:30.792
No thank you, Chaz.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.545
II don't drink anymore.

34:32.849 --> 34:35.190
Since when?

34:35.585 --> 34:38.347
Months. AAlmost a year now.

34:40.754 --> 34:42.223
Sure you don't want it?

34:49.163 --> 34:51.031
I'm flattered.

35:13.187 --> 35:15.054
It was good seeing you again, Deb.

35:15.055 --> 35:16.094
You, too.

35:16.119 --> 35:17.807
You ever fall off the wagon,
just stop by.

35:17.832 --> 35:19.927
You'll put that word in
with Jaime, right?

35:21.729 --> 35:23.793
I was just being polite.

35:24.174 --> 35:26.308
You burned a woman doing a dye job

35:26.333 --> 35:27.887
because you were shitfaced.

35:27.912 --> 35:30.379
The woman sued.
Jaime almost lost the shop.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.606
But I'm sober now.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.995
Good for you, Deb.

36:17.483 --> 36:18.651
Fuck!

36:52.197 --> 36:53.319
Fuck!

37:01.562 --> 37:03.232
Hi, sir.

37:03.340 --> 37:06.637
Have you seen, this woman today?

37:06.843 --> 37:08.905
Yes. Yes.

37:08.930 --> 37:10.072
She was in earlier.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.422
- Yeah?
- Bought a bottle of water.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.819
- Water?
- Yes.

37:14.882 --> 37:17.377
- This woman?
- Yes, sir.

37:17.378 --> 37:18.778
There was only one woman in today.

37:18.779 --> 37:20.780
I'm sure I'd know.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.882
I guess you would.

37:24.718 --> 37:28.203
Can I, see a bottle of vodka?

37:28.369 --> 37:32.075
- Absolutely. Yes sir.
- No, no. The premium.

37:32.719 --> 37:34.663
Yes, sir.

37:34.835 --> 37:36.302
Cash or charge?

37:36.463 --> 37:38.330
Cash.

39:00.347 --> 39:02.149
I'm sorry.

39:31.111 --> 39:33.659
You know what it is? It's...

39:35.407 --> 39:38.722
It's not that she died.
It's that... She was old.

39:38.747 --> 39:41.187
She... She was old.

39:41.188 --> 39:43.654
It's that she lived...

39:43.876 --> 39:47.795
her last months in a home,

39:47.820 --> 39:50.939
and I was too busy to come
and help take care...

39:51.019 --> 39:52.880
You were married
and living in California.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.412
I know.

40:11.807 --> 40:14.062
She was alone.

40:14.555 --> 40:16.223
You were with her.

40:20.894 --> 40:23.063
She must have been terrified.

40:23.925 --> 40:26.073
Hi.

40:27.034 --> 40:29.295
I'm sorry your mom died.

40:30.304 --> 40:32.384
Thanks.

40:43.501 --> 40:45.188
She's an odd duck.

40:45.296 --> 40:47.878
Yeah, but I like her.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.659
Hey.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.580
Hi.

41:33.399 --> 41:37.058
They lent me a work vehicle to get home.

41:37.549 --> 41:39.468
That's nice. Shows trust.

41:39.605 --> 41:42.216
- You took the car.
- It's my car.

41:42.558 --> 41:44.409
Been a while since you drove it, Ma.

41:44.410 --> 41:47.479
- I didn't forget how.
- Right. You could've told me.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.675
I was running late for my big interview,

41:49.700 --> 41:52.611
didn't factor a bus
into my commute time.

41:52.818 --> 41:55.287
You're right. II should have
given you some warning.

41:55.288 --> 41:57.422
No, no. It's all right.

41:57.481 --> 41:59.545
I should have realized something was up

41:59.570 --> 42:02.639
when I saw you ditched all your vodka.

42:02.722 --> 42:04.589
A lot of bottles.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.223
You know, it, um...

42:13.802 --> 42:16.023
It can be dangerous

42:17.173 --> 42:19.173
quitting cold turkey.

42:21.344 --> 42:23.793
People have seizures.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.862
So, you drove into town.

42:33.823 --> 42:36.728
It looks... II wouldn't say good,

42:36.950 --> 42:39.027
but better, you know?

42:39.204 --> 42:41.084
II went by the Edmunds plant.

42:41.109 --> 42:43.506
Have you seen what they're
doing with that place?

42:43.531 --> 42:45.254
Where else did you go?

42:45.761 --> 42:47.593
I went by the salon.

42:47.643 --> 42:49.380
- No way.
- Way.

42:49.747 --> 42:51.969
Did they give you back your job?

42:52.174 --> 42:54.493
They're not hiring right now.

42:54.644 --> 42:57.016
II ran into Chaz Chapman.

42:57.041 --> 42:58.842
He says hi.

42:59.028 --> 43:01.065
Good ol' Chaz.

43:03.452 --> 43:05.054
Did he fuck you?

43:08.391 --> 43:10.326
You weren't born mean.

43:12.899 --> 43:14.994
I'm sorry. That was shitty.

43:15.376 --> 43:17.310
I was just so worried, Mom.

43:17.733 --> 43:21.420
You know, you haven't driven
in a couple of years,

43:21.804 --> 43:24.055
and you've been drunk since then.

43:24.473 --> 43:26.777
You know, I was so worried.
I called the hospitals.

43:26.802 --> 43:27.944
I was tearing my hair out.

43:27.945 --> 43:29.990
I borrowed a work van.

43:30.015 --> 43:32.000
- I drove round and round.
- No, honey boy.

43:32.025 --> 43:34.418
I kept picturing the car...

43:36.569 --> 43:38.942
crashed into a tree.

43:40.871 --> 43:44.750
Your face aaall smashed...

43:44.894 --> 43:46.702
- I'm okay.
- Blood all over it.

43:46.727 --> 43:49.139
I'm okay. I'm okay.

43:53.836 --> 43:56.349
I can't lose you.

43:58.823 --> 44:01.271
I don't love anyone else.

44:02.730 --> 44:04.865
No one else loves me.

44:09.051 --> 44:11.000
I just have you.

44:11.619 --> 44:13.856
And I have you.

44:15.801 --> 44:18.536
I mean, you have...

44:18.903 --> 44:23.332
You know, you have
the town and... the salon.

44:23.404 --> 44:24.910
They're not hiring.

44:25.601 --> 44:28.045
Yeah, but they'll make an exception.

44:28.070 --> 44:30.312
Brady.

44:30.590 --> 44:33.360
The salon is never gonna hire me back.

44:40.532 --> 44:43.935
So, I guess you're stuck with me.

44:47.669 --> 44:49.301
Yeah?

44:49.959 --> 44:51.961
Yeah.

44:57.900 --> 44:59.746
So...

45:02.572 --> 45:05.175
you won't be needing these
to drive into town again, then.

45:07.794 --> 45:09.336
Nah.

45:09.512 --> 45:11.514
Why would I need to do that?

45:16.735 --> 45:18.441
Don't move.

45:18.690 --> 45:20.826
I got you a present.

45:57.536 --> 46:00.496
Closer and closer, motherfucker.

46:22.174 --> 46:23.441
How is she?

46:23.586 --> 46:26.153
Alive.

46:27.136 --> 46:28.436
Sobering up, hopefully.

46:28.772 --> 46:31.560
Can't freaking believe
she'd do this again.

46:32.804 --> 46:34.438
She was booked.

46:34.827 --> 46:36.064
For what?

46:37.858 --> 46:39.467
Possession of a controlled substance.

46:39.468 --> 46:41.215
Failure to comply.

46:42.276 --> 46:45.278
There needs to be
a wrath of God response.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.227
I mean, she needs to understand

46:47.343 --> 46:49.251
how dire this has gotten.

46:49.457 --> 46:51.058
She was booked.

46:51.147 --> 46:52.997
She's in holding.

46:53.749 --> 46:55.683
She's going to be processed.

46:57.153 --> 46:59.206
Whoa. Wh...

46:59.849 --> 47:02.301
You need to put the brakes on that.

47:02.558 --> 47:03.904
I can't. It's not my collar.

47:04.015 --> 47:06.622
Well, then talk
to the arresting officer.

47:06.695 --> 47:08.163
- He's gone home.
- Call him!

47:08.392 --> 47:10.297
And be in his infinite debt?

47:10.366 --> 47:12.289
This guy likes to own people.

47:12.392 --> 47:13.635
Then be owned.

47:13.829 --> 47:16.347
She is a good girl

47:16.433 --> 47:18.416
who just made some poor decisions.

47:18.441 --> 47:21.296
Yeah, last year, to celebrate
her 18th birthday, she OD'd.

47:21.321 --> 47:23.757
- I...
- This is her third DUI!

47:23.782 --> 47:24.940
She's robbed from you,

47:24.965 --> 47:26.548
she's robbed from me,
she's robbed from your sister,

47:26.549 --> 47:27.582
she's robbed from everybody
who tries to help her.

47:27.583 --> 47:28.650
All right. Look, look, look. I agree.

47:28.651 --> 47:30.318
I agree something needs to be done,

47:30.408 --> 47:31.743
but not this!

47:31.768 --> 47:33.354
- What's gonna change?
- No. No!

47:33.355 --> 47:34.823
- What's gonna change?
- No!

47:34.848 --> 47:37.458
She contracts HIV? Runs somebody over?

47:39.415 --> 47:42.484
We get called to I.D. her
in the fucking morgue?!

47:42.631 --> 47:44.591
I'm trying to save her life!

47:44.670 --> 47:45.910
I don't know how else to do it!

47:49.872 --> 47:51.697
I asked for Mom.

47:51.807 --> 47:53.832
I'm here, honey. I'm here.

47:54.009 --> 47:55.611
Miss Hodges, please stand up.

47:56.731 --> 47:58.065
Um...

47:58.459 --> 47:59.615
Stand up, please.

48:02.351 --> 48:03.785
Who is this?

48:03.960 --> 48:06.998
Officer Benedento will
escort you to processing.

48:06.999 --> 48:09.369
- What the fuck is this?
- There, you will change

48:09.394 --> 48:12.037
into a county uniform, as is mandatory.

48:12.093 --> 48:13.226
Um, fuck no! Mom!

48:13.251 --> 48:14.937
You will then be transported
to the county jail

48:14.961 --> 48:15.935
to await arraignment.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.873
Mom, what the fuck is this?

48:17.921 --> 48:19.167
I'm not gonna ask again.

48:29.579 --> 48:31.202
Whatever.

48:33.132 --> 48:34.515
I need to remove this hair clip.

48:34.516 --> 48:36.061
- Hey, don't! Don't!
- Mrs. Hodges,

48:36.132 --> 48:37.286
we had this discussion.

48:37.311 --> 48:38.895
You cannot touch her.

48:41.923 --> 48:44.792
Okay, so clearly,
this was a cry for help,

48:44.906 --> 48:48.517
and, like, obviously,
you guys heard it, so...

48:48.605 --> 48:50.906
Please face me, and open your mouth.

48:52.734 --> 48:55.451
Stop this. Stop.

48:55.737 --> 48:57.733
Nose ring.

49:00.385 --> 49:01.652
Um...

49:01.763 --> 49:03.631
Okay, can we just...

49:09.836 --> 49:11.437
I have a sickness.

49:13.688 --> 49:16.156
II didn't choose this.

49:16.157 --> 49:19.934
I don't... I don't want to be this way.

49:20.295 --> 49:23.203
And you know jail isn't gonna
just, like, magically heal me.

49:23.228 --> 49:25.815
It's... I'm not gonna
go in and come out fixed.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.376
I have to... I have to get clean.

49:30.331 --> 49:34.226
And, you know,
I could... I could paint again.

49:34.607 --> 49:38.010
You know I just sold
a painting last month?

49:38.503 --> 49:41.515
You know, it... it's the one
that you like, Daddy.

49:41.516 --> 49:43.081
You know the one?

49:43.106 --> 49:45.805
The people are in the rain,

49:46.588 --> 49:48.923
and you said that they look sad.

49:53.820 --> 49:56.889
I've asked Officer Benedento
to leave your wrists uncuffed,

49:56.914 --> 49:58.862
but it's entirely up to her discretion

49:58.887 --> 50:00.402
how long they stay that way.

50:05.434 --> 50:06.569
This way.

50:09.660 --> 50:11.394
Love you, Mom.

50:11.468 --> 50:13.270
I love you.

50:23.593 --> 50:24.758
Close your eyes.

50:31.166 --> 50:33.101
Tada!

50:34.369 --> 50:35.569
It's top shelf.

50:36.179 --> 50:37.834
I figured you might want a drink.

50:38.106 --> 50:39.834
Why?

50:40.616 --> 50:43.033
Wean you off the stuff.

50:43.445 --> 50:45.866
So you don't have a seizure

50:46.469 --> 50:47.751
and end up talking

50:47.776 --> 50:51.307
like someone hit you
in the head with shovel.

50:51.858 --> 50:54.608
You have two tonight, one tomorrow...

50:56.802 --> 50:58.738
and you're off the stuff.

51:20.866 --> 51:22.413
<i>Hey. It's Allie.</i>

51:22.460 --> 51:23.793
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>

51:23.818 --> 51:25.309
<i>so leave a message. Thanks.</i>

51:26.642 --> 51:28.618
Hey. It's Dad.

51:30.267 --> 51:34.062
It's been a while
since I heard from you.

51:34.768 --> 51:38.967
Figured today of all days I'd, um,

51:39.340 --> 51:41.189
try again.

51:44.432 --> 51:46.434
Been thinking about you a lot.

51:48.042 --> 51:49.804
I miss you.

51:51.349 --> 51:54.795
Anyway, look,
um, happy birthday, honey.

51:57.499 --> 51:59.398
I love you.

52:24.662 --> 52:27.859
Hold. Step down.

52:31.553 --> 52:33.589
Step down.

52:34.383 --> 52:36.322
Don't cry.

52:37.292 --> 52:39.026
Please, don't cry.

52:42.297 --> 52:44.165
Step down.

52:44.445 --> 52:46.262
Wait for her.

52:46.410 --> 52:48.078
Step down.

52:50.176 --> 52:51.978
Step down.
