18:17.964 --> 18:21.301
Hmm? Oh, you're into
my socks, girl?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.635
Thank you.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.137
Yeah, I would like to come back
to your house

18:24.171 --> 18:25.638
for some hot chocolate
and light kissing.

[ Chuckles ]

18:27.039 --> 18:28.341
Do you feel a little bad
going ice skating

18:28.375 --> 18:29.742
after what we did to Evan?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.144
No.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.446
Ah, just who
I was looking for.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.316
You two are taking me to
the Teacher Supply Store.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.451
No way! We're just
about to go skating.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.921
If you refuse, I'll tell Mom
you took me to an R-rated movie.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.157
Are you blackmailing us?

18:44.191 --> 18:47.460
If putting a label on it helps
you swallow it, then sure.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.329
Sometimes you're the knife.
Sometimes you're the balloon.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.097
Now, chop chop,
you balloons.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.265
Mom will never
believe you.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.600
It's two against one,

18:53.633 --> 18:55.535
our word versus yours.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.170
Versus this ticket stub.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.573
Still think scrapbooking
is a joke?

[ Knock on door, door opens ]

[ Door closes ]

19:10.583 --> 19:12.485
I thought you hated the way
I painted your nails.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.058
I saw your
homework assignment.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.528
"My favorite hobby is...

19:21.561 --> 19:23.696
doing nails with Jessica."

19:31.037 --> 19:33.540
But we're not even
friendly with each other.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.375
You don't even look at me
when I do your nails.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.425
Always crying
during sports.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.068
I'm sorry I told you
I liked Bernard

20:02.101 --> 20:04.237
so I could use
your wheelchair.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.205
I hope we didn't
mess things up with him.

[ Both chuckle ]

20:23.089 --> 20:24.190
I know it's late,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.926
but do you want to
go shopping with me?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.529
All the good sales are over,
but who knows --

20:29.562 --> 20:31.731
we might see somebody
get trampled.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.966
I'd like that.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.039
Hey!

20:40.072 --> 20:42.275
I'm ready
for Black Friday!

20:42.309 --> 20:45.578
I just...I needed a little
hair of the dog.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.314
Here.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.948
Mm.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.820
Hey, so did I come over
yesterday?

20:53.853 --> 20:54.954
Were we all together?

20:54.987 --> 20:57.490
'Cause things
are a bit hazy.

20:57.524 --> 21:00.092
At some point,
I think I made nachos.

21:00.126 --> 21:03.730
And I also recall doing a load
of laundry in my underwear.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.599
And then I think I tried
to go for a run, and --

21:06.633 --> 21:07.600
Sure did.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.736
Ooh! Ooh!

21:09.769 --> 21:13.506
And then I woke up in bed under
the covers with my shoes on.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.342
And my hair was wet
for some reason.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.809
And Marvin's not
talking to me,

21:16.843 --> 21:18.911
which isn't a great sign.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.848
Yeah, so...
