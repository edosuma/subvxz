WEBVTT

00:13.280 --> 00:15.000
Is that a yes?

00:16.480 --> 00:17.800
You mean forever?

00:17.880 --> 00:18.720
Mm-hmm.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.240
We've only been dating
for three months, Manuel.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.200
Oh, sorry! Uh, sorry, sorry.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.240
What the hell is that?

03:01.560 --> 03:04.520
Hey! Isn't there
someplace else you can put this?

03:05.720 --> 03:06.600
Hey.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.160
I'm sorry.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.320
We got here at night.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.000
We didn't see your tent. Sorry.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.360
There's an amazing fig tree over there.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.760
Can I offer you breakfast?

03:27.640 --> 03:28.840
They're nice and ripe.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.120
-I'll just pack up my things, then.
-No.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.800
I mean, whenever.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.880
No rush, you know.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.840
I'm Guilherme.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.560
Catarina.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.080
Here.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.840
It's good.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.080
Bruno, this is Catarina.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.720
Hi, Catarina.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.640
Want some of this?

04:43.560 --> 04:45.480
Where did you guys come from?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.080
The island of <i>The Blue Lagoon,</i> maybe.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.800
Hello.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.240
-How are you?
-I'm good. You?

06:14.320 --> 06:16.080
Haven't seen you in ages. You look good.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.840
-It's true. You too.
-Thank you. Thanks.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.560
-Okay, let me see if this works.
-Oh. What's that for?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.280
Your dad paid for the premium package,

06:24.360 --> 06:26.800
so you all get a video
of the bride and groom.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.440
-Is that true?
-Mm-hmm.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.600
Spectacular.

06:30.120 --> 06:30.960
Okay.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.520
What's with the notebook?

06:33.600 --> 06:35.880
Oh, I like to take notes for the ceremony.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.600
-Cool. That's very professional.
-Mm-hmm.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.600
You know what you're doing.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.240
-Must've planned tons of weddings, right?
-Yeah.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.720
-Great. Should we get started?
-Of course.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.280
-Yeah?
-Sure, of course.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.360
Let me just… Mm…

06:51.800 --> 06:53.480
Right. Let's do it.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.560
Okay.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.400
There… Let me just see… There.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.840
Hmm. How did you two meet?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.520
We'd like the best man to be part
of this interview if that's okay.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.320
-Okay.
-He's right outside.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.840
Of course. I'll go…
I'll go get him. Excuse me.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.320
Bruno? Could you come join us?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.160
Excuse me.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.880
These were the fallopian tubes
that made you so perfect

07:47.640 --> 07:49.360
Why are you all wet?

07:50.120 --> 07:52.880
It's a grown-up thing.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.920
Do you want to play with me?

07:55.760 --> 07:56.600
Okay.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.360
Thank you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.280
Paixão?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.040
-Mrs. Vanessa Paixão?
-Hmm?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.440
You can go in.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.640
There you go.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.840
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.600
Marry me. Yay!

08:32.520 --> 08:33.520
Mm.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.440
You never came back to yoga.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.920
Mm, work's really busy.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.320
The teacher asked about you.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.120
I'm old enough
to be his mother.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.360
The boy likes his women mature.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.800
How do you know that?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.000
No.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.520
Men our age see us as spoiled goods.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.080
Whenever it's a kid his age,
which is rare,

09:07.840 --> 09:09.560
we're like a fetish.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.880
Which would you rather be? Hmm?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.720
-I'll write you a prescription.
-Mm.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.520
Besides the hot flashes,

09:22.600 --> 09:25.520
you might experience
irritability, fatigue…

09:25.600 --> 09:27.720
…and a low libido.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.800
Ugh, well, that could be
the title of my memoir this past year.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.360
So, you're gonna start taking--

09:34.440 --> 09:36.600
Come on, don't you think
it's too early for this?

09:36.680 --> 09:39.280
You always were precocious, Vanessa.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.680
Start taking estrogen.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.160
-And if you need anything else, call me.
-Mm-hmm.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.320
You can get dressed.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.680
Oh. You might
experience some vaginal dryness.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.880
CAR PARTS SHOP

09:57.920 --> 09:58.920
Judas.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.320
Judas?

10:22.320 --> 10:23.280
Judas!

10:23.360 --> 10:25.480
Oh, Mrs. Paixão, how are you?

10:25.560 --> 10:26.680
Good, thanks.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.800
So your car is almost ready to go.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.360
There was a tiny problem.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.720
And how much
will this "tiny problem" cost me?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.280
Oh, it's not a big deal.

10:34.360 --> 10:38.040
But when we were running the scanner,
we noticed the car had problems

10:38.120 --> 10:42.000
with irritability, fatigue, low libido,

10:42.080 --> 10:46.520
and we also found facial hair
and sleep disturbances.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.800
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep…</i>

10:54.160 --> 10:55.200
All right.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.640
Uh, Mrs. Paixão, don't worry.
It's just the exhaust pipe.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.400
Oh, and I also gave you
the sexy cougar discount as usual.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.680
Oh, great.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.920
Okay, um…

11:14.800 --> 11:17.200
-Okay, what do I owe you?
-It's 250.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.680
Come by the gallery.
I might have a job for you.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.560
I got to go. Talk to you later. Okay, bye.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.880
Don't even think about
smoking inside the house.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.600
If I'd married you,
then I'd be a man with healthier habits.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.280
If we'd gotten married,
we wouldn't still be married.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.560
What happened to the girl
who used to bum a cigarette off me

11:52.640 --> 11:54.360
and pose nude at the arts academy?

12:01.520 --> 12:04.520
Your son and daughter-in-law
were here this morning

12:04.600 --> 12:06.480
planning the ceremony with Rita.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.840
Half of the money now,

12:08.920 --> 12:11.880
and the other half
after my son's execution.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.200
Come on.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.800
You should be happy.
Your only son is going to get married.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.120
Two failed marriages haven't made me
a fan of a formal ceremony

12:23.200 --> 12:24.640
celebrating monogamy.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.760
And besides, shouldn't the bride's father
pay for the reception?

12:28.840 --> 12:31.800
No. Not when
the father of the groom is rich.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.080
Another reason
why you should've married me.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.160
Sorry, I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important,

12:39.240 --> 12:43.520
but could you pay me in cash?
It's just that a check takes three days

12:43.600 --> 12:45.720
-to show up in a business account.
-Of course.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.240
I confess, I'm stuck in the 20th century
when it comes to this stuff.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.360
But don't worry. Not a problem.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.360
Thanks.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.320
So, is the business doing that badly?

12:57.920 --> 13:01.120
Hmm. Things improved a little
with all the gay marriages.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.240
Then the gays figured out
what straight folk already knew.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.000
Equal rights, equal divorces.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.120
Getting married is like buying a car.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.160
It starts losing value from day one.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.240
Whoa.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.280
You're so romantic,
it takes my breath away.

13:24.840 --> 13:29.680
This week, I'm hosting an art exhibition
for a new artist at the gallery.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.120
-Would you like to be my guest?
-Hmm.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.200
I don't think I can.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.360
I'm going to Porto for work.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.520
Well then, maybe you can come
to the gallery for pleasure.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.120
What are you doing in Porto?

13:46.120 --> 13:48.960
Well, I'm going to a divorce convention.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.920
Hallelujah!

13:51.000 --> 13:53.760
Now go on, get out of here.
Because it's past my bedtime.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.920
Hmm.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.800
Rita.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.640
Rita?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.560
-Rita!
-Mm. Hmm?

14:28.400 --> 14:31.960
I've locked the doors and the windows.
I'm going to bed. I'm dead.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.880
Hard day?

14:34.560 --> 14:35.760
-Same as usual.
-Hmm.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.000
How did your interview go
with Vasco's son this afternoon?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.160
Mm, I'm editing the video now.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.360
<i>I don't think there's a secret.</i>

14:43.440 --> 14:47.320
<i>I think that each person</i>
<i>needs to find what they need.</i>

14:48.280 --> 14:51.240
<i>But what we need changes over time.</i>

14:52.920 --> 14:54.920
Yesterday you were a baby,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.120
-and now you plan weddings, edit videos.
-Hmm.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.000
When you were born, I wanted a boy.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.240
Mom, I've heard the story
a thousand times.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.680
But then, you were so perfect,
so perfect. You were all mine.

15:13.440 --> 15:17.200
The poop, the pee, diapers,
they were all mine.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.080
-Yuck, you're so gross!
-You were all mine.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.760
Mm.

15:23.000 --> 15:23.960
Hmm.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.040
Sometimes, I'd put you on my chest

15:27.720 --> 15:30.680
and the two of us
would just stay like that for hours.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.480
Just us.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.280
Mm.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.080
You used to suck your thumb all the time.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.720
Stop it.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.640
That's the reason I had to wear braces.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.800
Sophomore year, my nicknames
were "Beaver" and "Can-opener."

15:50.880 --> 15:51.960
-That's it?
-"That's it?"

15:52.040 --> 15:53.000
Why not "Squirrel"?

15:53.080 --> 15:55.320
-"Can-opener" is awful.
-No, it's cute.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.280
It's not, not your sophomore year.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.080
You know, you should start eating soap.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.280
Sorry. Wasn't me.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.560
You should be more careful.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.920
Excuse me?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.480
You should be more careful.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.400
You forgot this.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.040
Oh.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.680
-What's with you?
-I'm so menopausal.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.760
Mom!

17:52.640 --> 17:53.600
Come on.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.400
You can't just say,

17:55.480 --> 17:58.160
"Oh, I'm so menopausal!"

17:58.720 --> 18:00.360
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.120
It was these fallopian tubes
that made you so perfect.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.960
You know why
they're called fallopian tubes?

18:06.040 --> 18:07.000
No.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.400
They're named after
this Italian man Gabriele Falloppio.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.440
Thousands of years of female evolution,

18:12.520 --> 18:15.040
and they name an organ
only women have after a man.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.600
What's the problem?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.440
So if Mr. Falloppio discovered the tubes…

18:18.520 --> 18:20.400
-He didn't.
-…he deserves recognition.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.040
He didn't do anything.
They were always there.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.800
You're right.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.280
They were always there.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.840
But now they're going to
stop working. Hmm.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.160
Mm.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.160
Mm.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.800
THE 8th WEDDING CONVENTION
DIVORCE: GET AN EXTRA LIFE

18:40.880 --> 18:42.440
Limousines. Themed weekends.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.720
An intimate massage for her.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.680
Golf tournament for him.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.160
Since our business
began to organize divorce parties,

18:51.240 --> 18:55.120
our revenue increased by 17%.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.720
Last year, for every three marriages,
we celebrated one divorce.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.760
Because for every person
who cries over the end of a relationship,

19:04.280 --> 19:06.840
there's at least one other
who celebrates it.

19:06.920 --> 19:10.440
A divorce is a new opportunity.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.440
It's a new beginning.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.760
A new life. Hmm?

19:17.520 --> 19:21.400
What can I tell you?
It's like adolescence, but the opposite.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.920
And just like adolescence,
it too will pass.

19:24.760 --> 19:29.560
Oh, Vanessa, we spend our whole lives
subjugated to our bodies.

19:29.640 --> 19:32.120
We have to be thinner,
we have to be fatter,

19:32.200 --> 19:34.480
our breasts get big when we're pregnant,

19:34.560 --> 19:37.400
and then sag when we stop breastfeeding.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.200
We get blemishes on our face,
stretch marks on our ass.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.120
Cellulite on our stomach,
we get menstrual cramps,

19:44.200 --> 19:47.000
we get PMT, urinary tract infections.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.600
I had periods
for over 40 years.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.760
And how many times
did I miss out on going to the beach,

19:52.840 --> 19:54.400
or sleeping with some cute guy

19:54.480 --> 19:57.360
because I was on my period
and he thought it was gross?

19:57.440 --> 20:00.680
Of all the things
that stop working as we age,

20:00.760 --> 20:04.680
this is much more of a good thing
than a bad one.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.720
Look, it's a bit like a divorce.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.520
You gain a new life.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.800
Please tell me your hair didn't fall out.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.880
Hmm, not really.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.640
Hmm, but I did suffer
from terrible vaginal dryness.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.640
-God, no.
-Tell me about it.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.240
What are you talking about?
What's so funny?

20:23.880 --> 20:25.040
About a problem.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.520
You won't have to deal with it
for a very long time, sweetheart

20:28.600 --> 20:29.640
No.

21:09.280 --> 21:13.360
Being far from someone
is as important as being close by

21:13.440 --> 21:15.880
You can come in.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.800
Mm-hmm. The couple too.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.320
Seriously, is it really that difficult?

21:20.400 --> 21:23.240
I'm so sick of telling her
when she's not even listening.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.280
"You put red panties in with my laundry,
you'll ruin my white shirts." That simple.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.880
Now I look like a playboy
having a mid-life crisis.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.640
That's what love is.
Anticipating the needs of others.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.720
Come on, man, I've been waiting for you.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.400
I need you to take some shots
of an actress. She's over at the VIP bar.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.640
She's from all those soaps.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.840
-Let him in. Hurry up.
-What the fuck was that?

21:43.520 --> 21:44.520
Sorry, man.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.080
Shit.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.720
Hmm?

22:00.760 --> 22:04.040
When she wanted to go
to all those parties back then, I went.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.440
When she wanted to go to Madeira,
who paid for it?

22:06.520 --> 22:07.640
This idiot right here.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.840
But when I asked her to separate colors,
she can't get it done?

22:10.920 --> 22:13.520
Hmm. That's why I still live with my mom.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.600
Hmm.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.440
Man, you know I like your work.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.480
But don't show up looking like that.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.360
Right.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.040
Let's talk business. Here you go.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.720
When will you need me again?

22:52.360 --> 22:53.440
You have a tuxedo?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
A tuxedo?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.160
Sure, do you want a top hat
or a bowler too?

23:02.360 --> 23:04.160
I'm looking for new clients.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.440
For a different type of event.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.680
I might have a job for you this week.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.760
I'll let you know.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.800
-Okay?
-Okay.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.040
Go on.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.960
Don't forget, man. Tuxedo.

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
Dad?

23:37.520 --> 23:38.920
Dad, come on, it's 11:00 already.

23:39.000 --> 23:39.920
Huh?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.960
Eleven o'clock. Get up.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.000
Give me a minute.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.480
You got it.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.040
-Hurry up. I'll be here waiting for you.
-Hold on.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.960
Right, give me some.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.000
I'm ready.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.800
Do you know how many chickens
were tortured to make that?

24:31.120 --> 24:33.520
Good thing I'm at the top
of the food chain, then.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.080
Seriously.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.040
With that exploitative-capitalist
personality of yours,

24:40.120 --> 24:42.480
I really don't know
how we're not millionaires yet.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.760
I'm doing my best.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.040
I got five gigs this week.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.080
Hmm. Do you need help?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.760
No. You just focus on school.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.080
-You mean my master's?
-Hmm.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.920
So what do you have today?

25:02.640 --> 25:07.200
Vasco called. Said he wants
to speak to me about a project.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.080
An exhibition?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.360
Well…

25:11.440 --> 25:14.480
Cool. Well, I'm coming with you, then.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.600
Girls, you can unload the rest
through the back door, it's open.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.200
Hello.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.920
I have a meeting with the gallery owner.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.520
-Daniel?
-Yes.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.320
Forgive me.
Vasco has spoken very highly of your work.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.000
I don't know
if you've seen my portfolio.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.680
No, I haven't had a chance
to look at it, but Vasco trusts you.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.280
I've taken part in a few exhibitions.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.120
Collective ones.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.080
I've got some of my work here.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.400
Sorry. This is a bit awkward.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.320
But Vasco didn't tell you
what we need you for?

25:52.080 --> 25:55.160
We need someone to take pictures
for us on the opening night.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.200
You understand?

25:56.680 --> 26:01.000
The artists, the guests, the usual stuff.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.840
Can you get here
a half hour before it starts?

26:10.480 --> 26:11.320
Sure.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.880
Eighty-three percent of women
consider a kiss on the mouth

26:16.960 --> 26:19.880
to be the greatest act of intimacy
in a romantic relationship.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.880
That's one powerful erotic stimulant.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.720
All men care about is getting head.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.720
I haven't been here in years.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.800
Hasn't changed at all.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.600
The haunted house.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.720
Uh, this is new.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.640
Only Daniel is allowed in.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.480
Huh.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.680
Your father told me
to have a word with you today.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.760
He couldn't make it?

27:54.760 --> 27:58.600
You know perfectly well that your father
doesn't like to talk about money

27:58.680 --> 28:00.080
with family members.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.400
He finds that sort of topic
vulgar and dishonorable.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.280
Since when am I a member of his family?

28:05.360 --> 28:08.120
Don't start.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.160
You're too old for acts of rebellion.

28:33.760 --> 28:38.080
As you know,
the real estate market has changed a lot.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.760
And we've decided that the rent
for your house is no longer reasonable.

28:42.920 --> 28:46.120
That is the amount we believe
is more appropriate.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.040
Oh. Right.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.440
Right. There's no way I can afford this.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.480
My business isn't doing well.

29:01.480 --> 29:02.920
We have a lot of expenses.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.440
You could always make a purchase offer.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.960
Ah, finally.

29:10.600 --> 29:14.200
But why should I have to buy something
I'm going to inherit anyway?

29:14.280 --> 29:15.280
Daniel.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.760
What did I teach you?

29:19.680 --> 29:22.600
Never in front of the help.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.160
Pull!

29:45.560 --> 29:46.840
Grandpa, how are you?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.360
Whoa! Hold on! Hold on!

29:49.440 --> 29:50.800
It's me, Marco.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.160
Marco?

29:52.240 --> 29:55.320
-Yeah, uh, Daniel's son.
-Huh.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.920
Do you know how to fire a gun?

30:01.240 --> 30:02.160
-Hmm?
-No.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.920
-What do you do for a living?
-I'm a sociologist.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.520
Isn't that what sissies do?

30:09.320 --> 30:13.680
No, no, no, no. Please drop it.
I'm not into killing animals whatsoever.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.880
I knew it was a sissy thing.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.040
Pull!

30:25.880 --> 30:28.400
Whoa. Look at you.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.040
How long have you been allergic
to grandma and grandpa?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.600
Ever since I was 11.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.040
Here.

31:31.000 --> 31:31.960
Eva!

31:32.040 --> 31:34.000
Hello, Vanessa.
Your love birds have arrived.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.640
-They're inside.
-Okay, thanks.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.480
-And the orchids?
-Tomorrow.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.800
Tomorrow. Yes.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.920
The pharmacist said
this is the best for stress-induced hives.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.840
They said that
the Elephant Man used it as well.

32:45.240 --> 32:46.920
How's the thesis going?

32:47.560 --> 32:50.600
Pretty good.
I'm just going over some numbers.

32:50.680 --> 32:56.000
Did you know that Portugal has the,
uh, highest divorce rate in all of Europe?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.200
Seventy out of one hundred marriages fail.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.320
In 1971, there was only one divorce
in a hundred marriages.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.720
It's strange, isn't it?

33:07.280 --> 33:08.480
What do you think?

33:12.280 --> 33:14.320
Hmm… Nah.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.880
We need to go shopping.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.400
Here, take this.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.240
See if this works.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.560
Wow, look at that clientele.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.560
Come through. Have a good evening.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.680
Good night.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.760
For God's sake.
Separate beds don't make any sense.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.800
There are couples
who sleep in separate beds.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.640
Some even sleep in separate houses.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.200
Just because
I move around a lot in my sleep?

33:52.120 --> 33:56.200
In a relationship, intimacy is
just as important as proximity.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.960
It's not a costume party tonight.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.880
Hold on. Can you explain that to me?

33:59.960 --> 34:00.800
Okay.

34:00.880 --> 34:04.800
So, each person in a couple needs
to have their own space and time.

34:05.360 --> 34:09.800
So it's important to cultivate
distance as well as intimacy.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.800
-Jorge is waiting for me.
-Huh?

34:11.880 --> 34:13.680
Jorge is waiting for me.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.640
-Oh.
-Oh. Come in.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.960
Everyone has their own individuality.
You get it?

34:20.040 --> 34:23.480
I mean, wasn't it Tatiana's individuality
that made you like her?

34:24.600 --> 34:28.320
Well, to be honest with you, first thing
I noticed about her were her boobs.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.760
I told you to stop.
Hey, no running.

34:33.240 --> 34:36.920
We need to get your hair…
No, no. We're not playing right now.

34:37.000 --> 34:37.920
We're not…

34:38.000 --> 34:38.840
Hey!

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
This is Daniel.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.400
He's the official
runway photographer, okay?

34:45.400 --> 34:46.640
Have fun, Blackbeard.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.840
Are you a pirate?

34:51.960 --> 34:53.440
Do you have a glass eye?

34:53.520 --> 34:56.120
I do. Wanna see?

34:56.200 --> 34:57.440
Mm-hmm.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.800
NOBODY'S PERFECT

35:17.480 --> 35:19.520
Good evening. Thanks.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.520
<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed is not available.</i>

37:46.920 --> 37:49.040
Go ahead. Bruno is looking for you.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.880
You're late.

37:55.960 --> 37:59.160
The minister's left, and we don't have
a shot of him with the artists.

37:59.240 --> 38:03.200
-Sorry, I just came from another job.
-Where, at the wax museum?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.840
You can start with Didier,
he's a collector.

38:06.920 --> 38:07.760
Where is he?

38:07.840 --> 38:10.160
He's there,
underneath the photo of the armpit.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.520
Can you believe this guy?
So much for doing a favor.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.080
Daniel?

38:29.680 --> 38:30.520
Yeah?

38:31.160 --> 38:34.280
What's up?
It's me, Guilherme. Vasco's son.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.760
Wow.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.680
Well, you definitely grew up.
I didn't recognize you.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.360
-You're getting married, right?
-It's true, I am.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.000
And my dad told me that Daniel's
going to be the wedding photographer.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.440
Yes, that would be me.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.520
I've heard all the stories.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.760
Crazy.

38:52.840 --> 38:56.960
Stories from when you two lived together.
When you were younger.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.560
Yeah. La Movida.

38:59.680 --> 39:04.000
My dad's always spoken very highly of you.
He told me that he thought

39:04.080 --> 39:07.560
you were the best photographer
of your generation.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.360
You are. He still thinks that.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.320
Okay.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.920
-Well, thank you.
-Congratulations.

39:16.920 --> 39:17.840
See you.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.280
So? How's your health?

39:35.800 --> 39:37.600
Hey, that's my peg leg, man.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.200
I'm not dead yet.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.040
Mm-hmm.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.120
And how's work?

39:50.040 --> 39:53.640
They say, "If we do what we love,
then we don't work one day in our lives."

39:53.720 --> 39:54.840
-Right?
-Hmm.

39:54.920 --> 39:58.320
I've been a wedding photographer
for 20 years. You do the math.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.640
I know that, financially speaking,

40:09.720 --> 40:12.840
things haven't been
going too well for you two.

40:17.640 --> 40:18.480
Hmm.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.480
Hmm?

40:24.440 --> 40:28.440
Whatever I can do to help, just, um…

40:33.880 --> 40:35.480
Did you know that after you turn 40,

40:35.560 --> 40:38.040
your testicles sag
half a centimeter a year?

40:39.040 --> 40:40.800
Speak for yourself, man.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.720
Me? You're older than me.

40:46.800 --> 40:50.000
Sure. But everything here is impeccable.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.680
<i>This is Vanessa Paixão's voicemail.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

40:57.760 --> 41:01.560
I just wanted to ask
if you know what day Friday is.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.440
Sleep well.

41:44.080 --> 41:48.720
One thing is silence.
Another is the absence of words.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.960
Excuse me. May I have a fork?

42:05.640 --> 42:06.880
Thank you.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.960
I see you found my sunglasses.

42:22.840 --> 42:26.400
-What happened to you?
-My mother happened to me.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.960
My parents want to raise the rent
on the house again like last year.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.040
Are you smoking?

42:38.160 --> 42:40.280
Because you slept in the study
again last night.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.920
I got home late last night.
I didn't want to wake you up.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.080
You know that 30 years ago today,

42:50.160 --> 42:52.840
we spent the night together
for the very first time.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.360
That was July 8th.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.440
The World Cup Final was that day.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.120
Germany beat Argentina 1-0,
which never should have happened.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.920
Maradona cried.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.240
This is for you.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.480
Open it.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.480
I took that photo of you that day.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.200
This isn't me.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.200
Of course it's you. What do you mean?

43:32.200 --> 43:33.120
No.

43:34.000 --> 43:34.880
It's not me.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.560
This…

43:40.000 --> 43:43.720
…is a 20-something-year-old girl
who believed in happily ever after.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.920
Bon appétit.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.160
<i>…on RTP3.</i>

43:54.440 --> 43:55.280
Already?

43:55.360 --> 43:58.520
-You're going to bed already?
-Really sleepy, sweetheart.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.360
-See you tomorrow.
-Are you that tired?

44:00.440 --> 44:02.160
-Sleep well.
-My bones hurt.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.400
-Everything hurts now.
-See you in the morning.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.800
-Thanks, Nana. Good night.
-Sleep well.

44:06.880 --> 44:10.800
-Come on. Come on now.
-I'm coming. I'm coming. Wait.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.480
<i>What do you think</i>

44:12.560 --> 44:16.280
<i>is the secret formula</i>
<i>for your relationship, for your love?</i>

44:18.360 --> 44:20.240
<i>I don't think there's a secret.</i>

44:20.320 --> 44:24.640
<i>I think that each person</i>
<i>needs to find what they need.</i>

44:28.520 --> 44:31.640
<i>But what we need changes over time.</i>

44:36.920 --> 44:38.240
<i>Okay, and…</i>

44:40.000 --> 44:42.920
<i>where do you see yourselves in 25 years?</i>

44:44.160 --> 44:46.320
<i>Twenty-five years is a long time.</i>

44:47.400 --> 44:49.960
<i>I just really don't want us</i>
<i>to become one of those couples</i>

44:50.040 --> 44:52.760
<i>who eats a meal together</i>
<i>in silence, you know?</i>

45:11.360 --> 45:13.360
<i>Because silence is one thing.</i>

45:13.920 --> 45:16.600
<i>But the absence of words is another.</i>

45:24.240 --> 45:25.080
What's up?

45:28.800 --> 45:30.640
-Going to bed too?
-Yeah.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.440
-You're staying up?
-Yep.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.840
-All right. Good night.
-Good night.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.840
I see you're taking the laptop with you.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.320
-I am.
-Mm, mm, mm.

45:47.360 --> 45:51.080
<i>Sure. And the thing</i>
<i>that makes us happy today, yeah,</i>

45:51.160 --> 45:52.880
<i>is going to be different tomorrow.</i>

45:56.040 --> 46:00.200
<i>It's impossible to know what our life</i>
<i>is going to be like in 25 years.</i>

46:04.280 --> 46:07.520
<i>It's impossible to know what our life</i>
<i>is going to be like in 25 years.</i>

46:07.600 --> 46:08.440
Sweetheart.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.520
Sweetheart.

46:15.240 --> 46:18.200
<i>What we're doing</i>
<i>might not be considered normal.</i>

46:19.880 --> 46:23.480
<i>But then how many normal people actually</i>
<i>have a happy marriage? Am I right?</i>

46:28.520 --> 46:32.400
<i>Is it normal to be with someone</i>
<i>just because you're scared of being alone?</i>

47:08.440 --> 47:10.400
Here.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.400
So?

47:12.600 --> 47:13.560
Thanks.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.800
-I'll give it to you.
-Yeah, that's best.

47:17.880 --> 47:18.840
Here it is.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.600
Until life do us part.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.520
Until life do us part.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.400
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.080
All right.

48:04.320 --> 48:08.120
So why is the best man
driving the couple to the wedding night?

48:08.200 --> 48:09.840
-Some modern thing.
-Bye!

48:11.480 --> 48:12.400
Bye!

48:13.480 --> 48:16.280
-Everyone strapped in?
-Let's go.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.360
Bye!

48:22.840 --> 48:24.320
I want a divorce.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.920
Vanessa…
