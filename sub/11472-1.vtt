COACH: Come on, ladies!
Let's see some hustle.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.943
Uh, excuse me.
Is our little practice
bothering you?

00:09.976 --> 00:11.344
Get out there!

00:11.845 --> 00:13.246
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

00:13.279 --> 00:14.615
All right,
let's work!

00:14.648 --> 00:16.416
Let's scrimmage.
Come on!

00:16.449 --> 00:18.719
You seem so distant
these days, Brett.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.153
Is there something
I did?

00:20.186 --> 00:23.123
'Cause if there is,
I want you to tell me.

00:23.156 --> 00:24.290
Ashley, it's just...

00:24.324 --> 00:25.559
I'm ready
to work through

00:25.592 --> 00:28.028
whatever it is that we
need to work through.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.063
But we need
to communicate.

00:30.931 --> 00:34.067
I need you
to talk to me.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.738
Ashley, it's just that
I love you so much...

00:39.506 --> 00:40.974
It scares me.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.543
(CHUCKLES)

00:52.485 --> 00:54.921
Oh, man, you wanna
hear something
way messed up?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.723
(SNIFFLES) You know that
Molly Hatchet shirt

00:56.757 --> 00:58.291
I was wearing
the other day?

00:58.324 --> 00:59.960
The one with
the executioner guy

00:59.993 --> 01:01.494
holding the bloody axe,

01:01.528 --> 01:03.597
and under his foot's
the severed head?

01:03.630 --> 01:05.098
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.701
That's my shirt.
(LAUGHS)

01:07.734 --> 01:09.269
Yeah, so...

01:09.302 --> 01:11.972
My mom, she makes us go
to church every week,

01:12.005 --> 01:13.674
and we gotta dress up.

01:13.707 --> 01:14.741
And, so, I get there,

01:14.775 --> 01:18.078
and the stupid priest
says I can't come in.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.681
You can't wear
stuff like that
at church, man.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.649
Why not, man?
It's church.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.585
They're supposed to
forgive people there.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.319
So, you hate my shirt.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.021
Forgive me,
let me come in.

01:28.054 --> 01:29.756
Hey, I believe
in God, man.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.492
I've seen him.
I've felt his power.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.260
He plays drums
for Led Zeppelin,

01:34.294 --> 01:36.797
and his name
is John Bonham, baby.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.298
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.804
Nah, nah, nah.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.071
Here we go,
here we go.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.239
(IMITATING BILL MURRAY)
Hey, Lisa!

01:46.272 --> 01:48.241
Here's those noogies
you ordered.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.210
It's a real
Cinderella story.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.846
Eh, former greens keeper.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.214
Oh! He got all
of that one!

01:54.247 --> 01:56.983
It's in the hole!
It's in the hole!

01:57.017 --> 01:58.451
ALAN: Sam Weir.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.488
You really like
Bill Murray, don't you?

02:03.089 --> 02:04.758
SAM: Yeah. He's great.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.893
Bill Murray sucks, man.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.128
No, he doesn't.
He's cool.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.764
Oh, really?
What is he,
your boyfriend?

02:11.464 --> 02:12.866
Sam Queer.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.169
It's fightin' time, weird.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.403
Leave me alone, Alan.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.073
I'm sorry.
I don't speak geek.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.009
I always wanted to know
what it'd be like
to fight a girl.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.611
GIRL: I'm a girl.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.446
Wanna see what
it'd be like
to fight me?

02:27.648 --> 02:28.615
Uh...

02:28.649 --> 02:30.917
Weir's sister
has to protect him?

02:32.018 --> 02:33.820
I'm not protecting him.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.888
Just trying to
figure out

02:34.921 --> 02:36.156
why it is you
need to pick fights

02:36.189 --> 02:38.158
with guys who weigh less
than 100 pounds.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.425
Watch out, Alan.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.494
I think she's
high on pot.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.930
Yeah. I might just
go psycho on you.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.533
You wanna try me?

02:49.202 --> 02:50.504
You're dead,
all right?

02:50.537 --> 02:52.739
As soon as your
freak sister
isn't around,

02:52.773 --> 02:54.474
I'm gonna
cream you, man.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.914
You really didn't
need to do that.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.248
I could've
handled it.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.717
Yeah. I know.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.588
And by the way,
I weigh 103 pounds.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.223
Sorry.

and she said
she saw you smoking.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.464
(SCOFFS) Well, she's crazy.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.933
Mom... I can't believe you.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.069
Do you seriously think
I would start smoking?

Okay. I... (CHUCKLES)

04:31.538 --> 04:33.640
HAROLD: I had a friend
that used to smoke.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.376
You know what
he's doing now?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.712
He's dead.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.514
Now, you think smoking
makes you look cool,

04:40.547 --> 04:43.349
let's go dig him up now
and see how cool he looks.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.619
Daddy, if I started smoking,
I would tell you.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.054
Oh, good. Now I don't
have to worry.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.890
Hey, Dad, guess what.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.692
They're showing

watch it twice in a row.

Great.

Sam, isn't the Homecoming
Dance, Saturday night?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.735
Yeah.

05:01.768 --> 05:02.769
Are you going?

05:03.403 --> 05:05.205
No. Why would I do that?

05:05.238 --> 05:06.640
Well, your sister's going.

05:06.673 --> 05:07.508
No, I'm not.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.042
JEAN: All right, kids,

05:09.075 --> 05:10.811
high school
is for learning,

05:10.844 --> 05:14.414
but it's also where
you should be learning
how to socialize.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.817
That's what high school
dances are all about.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.484
No, they're not.
They're just a chance

05:18.519 --> 05:20.821
for the popular kids
to experiment with sex
in their cars.

you want me to do,

05:23.624 --> 05:26.359
then I'd be
happy to go.

05:26.392 --> 05:29.863
You know, there was
a girl in our school...

05:31.031 --> 05:33.233
She had premarital sex.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.902
You know what she did
on Graduation Day?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.203
Died.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.839

your friends alive?

05:41.241 --> 05:42.843

05:42.876 --> 05:44.911

there are plenty of kids

05:44.945 --> 05:47.814
who are just dying for
someone to ask them.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.083
(SCOFFS) Mom,
that's the stupidest thing

05:50.116 --> 05:51.184
I've ever heard.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.753
Honey, it's stupid
until you consider

05:52.786 --> 05:54.888
how happy
it will make somebody

05:54.921 --> 05:56.256
who really wants to go.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.024
Nobody I know wants to go.

Honey.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.728
Great. That works out perfect.

Why does my mom
always put a note
in my lunch?

07:17.370 --> 07:19.472
It's so embarrassing.

write the note on the bag.

see that happening.

Oh, I'm sorry. Did I crush
your twinkies?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.223
What did you
do that for?

go crying to your sister,

Alan, you don't have
anything better to do

07:52.839 --> 07:54.675
than to crush
Mr. Weir's dessert?

Oh, well, I was just
bending down to talk to him,

07:57.210 --> 07:58.745
and I accidentally
leaned on it.

07:58.779 --> 07:59.713
I'm sorry.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.014
Why don't you
do the nice thing

08:01.047 --> 08:02.282
and buy him new ones?

some advice?

08:09.823 --> 08:10.991
Be a man.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.262
You shouldn't let Alan
do that to you.

I don't see you
doing anything!

to stay out of fights

you guys backed me up

and she's a girl.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.775

back you up,

08:28.809 --> 08:30.944
than Alan's gonna
terrorize us, too.

have gotta help me,

gonna do?

09:44.317 --> 09:46.520
(CHUCKLES)
I don't know.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.054
What are you
gonna do?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.056
(CHUCKLES)

09:55.629 --> 09:58.131
So, you guys going
to the Homecoming Dance?

09:58.164 --> 09:59.299
(CHUCKLING) Oh, oh.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.634
I beg your pardon?

10:00.667 --> 10:01.802
That's funny.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.069
It's a joke, right?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.939
My dad's kinda
making me go.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.408
Your dad's making
you go to the dance?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.010
Man, what's that
all about?

10:10.811 --> 10:13.046
Who's your dad?
Hitler?

10:13.980 --> 10:14.915
(CHUCKLES)

10:14.948 --> 10:17.483
I just thought maybe
you guys were gonna go...

10:17.518 --> 10:20.353
To make fun of people.
(CHUCKLES)

10:20.386 --> 10:21.555
That could be
kinda funny, right?

10:21.588 --> 10:22.689
KEN: I would go,

10:22.723 --> 10:26.159
but I have
a prior engagement.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.562
My cousin just sent me
a bunch of mushrooms,

10:28.595 --> 10:29.863
And I'm gonna eat them.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.065
Look, you know they're
gonna play disco.

10:32.098 --> 10:35.035
Right? Disco sucks.
I hate disco.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.074
I'd rather make out
with Principal Farber.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.308
Ooh, again?

10:43.510 --> 10:44.845
Shut up, man.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.314
Ow.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.654
What, what?
Oh, my god, man.

10:53.687 --> 10:57.023
Oh! I can't wait till
you're not paying attention.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.091
Keep it up!

10:58.124 --> 11:00.260
Check it out.
What's she want?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.129
Lindsay?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.999
Linds?
Friend of yours...

11:06.567 --> 11:08.334
Linds?
(CHUCKLES)

11:09.335 --> 11:10.804
I'll be right back, okay?

11:12.138 --> 11:13.674
Okay.
Okay.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.844
Millie, what are you
doing out here?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.546
What are you
doing out here?

11:19.580 --> 11:21.214
This place
is for freaks.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.784
Millie, go away.

11:24.651 --> 11:25.919
Today's the deadline
to enter

11:25.952 --> 11:27.353
the Academic Decathlon.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.522
Mr. Rosso said
you didn't

11:28.555 --> 11:29.990
turn in
your application.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.491
What?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.960
Millie,
I'm not entering.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.730
But you're
our best math‐lete.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.667
Could we not talk
about this right now?

11:40.701 --> 11:43.369
Lindsay, what's
wrong with you?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.304
There's nothing
wrong with me.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.508
I just don't want to do
Decathlon this year.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.042
Aren't you at least
gonna help us

11:49.075 --> 11:51.545
serve refreshments
at the Homecoming Dance?

11:51.578 --> 11:52.713
We're trying
to raise money

11:52.746 --> 11:54.047
to buy the school
a computer.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.349
(SHUSHES)

11:58.585 --> 12:00.787
NEAL: Gentlemen,
here's my advice.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.356
Listen to Neal.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.291
You should handle Alan

12:05.325 --> 12:08.562
the same way Han Solo
dealt with Jabba the Hutt.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.796
Avoid him.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.032
Just avoid him forever?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.801
Just for four years.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.107

Dream on, Sam.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.275
Oh, man.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.877
Uh‐oh, incoming.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.548
Hey, Sam, I've been
looking all over for you.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.815
Is this your jacket?

12:30.116 --> 12:31.251
Yeah.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.485
You left it in science.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.154
I didn't want it
to get all dirty.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.091
Oh, thanks, Cindy.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.561
That was really
nice of you.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.962
Yeah, well,
I'll see you later.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.366
Sam.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.134
You are so in.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.403
What?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.506
She brought you
your jacket.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.740
That means...

12:53.774 --> 12:55.008
She saw it,

12:55.041 --> 12:57.010
she remembered
it was yours,

12:57.043 --> 12:59.780
she picked it up
and carried it
through the halls.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.016
People probably saw her
with it and everything.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.152
I wonder if she has
a date for the dance.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.122
Cindy Sanders is in love
with you, man.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.565
You really think
Cindy likes me?

13:18.599 --> 13:20.033
Hello?
The jacket.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.069
No way. We're not
her species.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.871
Listen, just
do me a favor.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.340
Ask around. See if she
has a date for the dance.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.576
Who should I ask?

13:29.610 --> 13:32.579
Okay. The dance
is tomorrow.

13:32.613 --> 13:33.980
She's a cheerleader.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.617
You've seen Star Wars
27 times.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.751
Do the math.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.452
I know, but my dad
always tells me

13:39.485 --> 13:41.922
that the prettiest girls
usually don't get asked out

13:41.955 --> 13:44.825
'cause guys are
too afraid to ask them.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.460
Really? Maybe
I should ask out

13:47.493 --> 13:49.029
Farrah Fawcett Majors.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.598
Hey, maybe I should
ask out Bill's mom.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.634
You better not.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.168
Listen, just
ask around, okay?

13:55.201 --> 13:56.603
Don't even
think about it.

13:58.772 --> 13:59.973
Get out of the way.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.977

you ordered.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.311
All right.
Good job.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.115
Where are the answers?

14:09.149 --> 14:11.451
You just said
to steal the test.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.953
Oh, good work,
genius.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.420
Way to use
your brain.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.258

14:24.097 --> 14:25.932
Oh, yeah,
that's real great.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.901
Why don't you
blow your nose
in some bread

14:27.934 --> 14:30.003
and make me
a sandwich, too?

14:30.036 --> 14:32.906

up my butt today?

I got some.

What's she doing here?

14:38.779 --> 14:40.046
Uh, she's our friend.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.314
What, are you doing her

14:41.347 --> 14:43.449
so that she'll help you
with your math homework?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.285
Hey, lay off.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.319

14:46.352 --> 14:48.388

to you, brain.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.456
Don't you have
a test to take
or something?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.958
Hey, would you
be cool?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.259
I mean, please.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.162
Did I do something
to you?

14:56.963 --> 14:58.198
You're here.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.767
Kim.

15:00.801 --> 15:02.969
I have as much right
to be here as you do.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.174
Hey, brain,

15:08.208 --> 15:11.011
I shoplift
in your daddy's store.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.613
You're just
some rich kid

15:12.646 --> 15:14.815
who's trying
to piss off her parents.

15:14.848 --> 15:16.216
You think you can
hang with these guys.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.318
You think that's gonna
make you cool?

15:21.655 --> 15:23.323
I don't know
what to tell you.

15:25.826 --> 15:28.595
You know what?
I'm sorry.

There. Now we're friends.
See you at the mall.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.204
What are you,
on your period?

15:38.238 --> 15:41.141
Hey, you wanna hang around
with your little
poser friend here

15:41.174 --> 15:43.276
and pretend with her,
that's your waste of time.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.145
Just keep her
the hell away from me.

I don't carry a purse.

I can pass.

to get to class, too?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.372
Oh. I'll survive.

very flattering,
are they?

No. You look good.

is dressing so weird now?

your dad's army jacket.

acting weird

disconnect emotionally,

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
it's really quite sad.

In his own way,
he's reaching out
for a friend.

feel sorry for him,
though.

25:38.839 --> 25:41.141

Tom Cressman,

if you fight your bully,

25:53.620 --> 25:55.756
afterwards,
whether you win
or lose,

25:55.789 --> 25:57.658
they'll tend
to leave you alone.

25:58.158 --> 25:59.359
Did it work?

He broke my tailbone,
but the results
were effective.

26:01.695 --> 26:03.597
He got expelled.
It's a good plan.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.566
It's a terrible plan, okay?

26:05.599 --> 26:08.368
I'm not fighting Alan.
He's not my tormentor.

he takes to each class,
and I avoid those halls.
