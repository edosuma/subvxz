00:23.240 --> 00:26.240
Stay close to me, Eleanor.
Do not fall behind.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.040
Faster!

00:30.160 --> 00:31.880
Do not stop!

00:32.040 --> 00:34.120
I can not do it anymore.
If we stop,

00:34.560 --> 00:35.920
we will be caught.

00:35.980 --> 00:38.076
And if they catch us, they
will immediately kill us.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.480
Hurry!

00:50.400 --> 00:51.480
Quickly!

00:54.840 --> 00:56.640
- Faster!
- I do what I can.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.640
At the moment, the princess
has not been found yet, sir.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.320
I trust Monsieur Marshall.

01:44.380 --> 01:45.620
We need to talk.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.100
I see the brilliance in your eyes, brother.

01:49.224 --> 01:49.959
I'd like to discuss hunting with you.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.056
I look forward to it with impatience.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.120
The Cardinal expressed the
hope to see you at Mass.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.200
Ask him to pray for us.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.720
I found the midwife.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.520
She lives in the south,
one day from here.

02:08.639 --> 02:09.735
Let her be sent for immediately.

02:09.759 --> 02:10.960
Too dangerous.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.760
No one should know that we have found her.
In that case, go to her yourself.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.920
I want you to hear with your
own ears everything she says.

02:18.980 --> 02:19.740
We will go together.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.296
Do you want me to risk my life
because of your bizarre fancies?

02:22.720 --> 02:23.880
Stop!

02:24.040 --> 02:25.400
It's true, I assure you.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.000
Damascus knights protect a
prisoner by order of the Vatican.

02:29.560 --> 02:33.280
This conspiracy led by the church, and
for the Pope pulls Cardinal Leto.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.736
Di Marco tried to kill me when
I got too close to the truth.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.040
I do not doubt that at all,

02:38.320 --> 02:40.960
that a man in an iron mask -
our illegitimate brother.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.360
The midwife is the only one,

02:43.600 --> 02:44.960
who can confirm this.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.240
And if you were wrong?

02:49.680 --> 02:52.640
Who else could it be?
Why hide his face?

02:55.320 --> 02:57.960
They want to put this
person on the throne.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.880
Shit. Do they seriously question
the legitimacy of my power?

03:05.040 --> 03:07.080
If the church finds out
about our older brother,

03:08.080 --> 03:10.240
he can be proclaimed the
true king of France.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.400
We leave immediately.
Warn the Bontemps.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.800
No, we will not warn anyone.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.160
In particular, Bontemps.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.960
You must prepare for the worst.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.160
On the path of a young
girl can meet robbers

04:42.320 --> 04:43.680
and vagabonds.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.720
And the people of the king.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.200
We must pray for her salvation.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.240
I'm afraid the Lord has
other plans for her.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.640
And me, too.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.800
Even if he wants her to return
here intact and safe,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.240
will she have enough character,

05:02.080 --> 05:03.680
to become a queen?

05:05.520 --> 05:07.520
She was taken away against her will.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.160
On her return, my plans for
Spain will not change.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.280
If the people of Louis will find it

05:32.720 --> 05:33.720
Madam Duverne?

05:34.320 --> 05:35.480
What's left of her.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.160
You can not rob your own people.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.680
Stop it! That's enough!

05:43.681 --> 05:45.657
Fuck off, our stomachs are empty.
Yes, we all want to eat,

05:45.720 --> 05:48.280
and we all suffer equally.
Who is guilty?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Stop it!

05:51.880 --> 05:54.600
The King says that France
belongs to all of us.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.200
He promises us the moon from heaven,

05:56.600 --> 05:58.680
but in fact only forces
to pay exorbitant taxes.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.520
Look, what's left for us?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.640
I do not know about you,
but I'm pretty satisfied.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.080
The Council can not wait to decide
the question of your marriage, sir.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.560
I would like to ask His
Majesty's permission to do it.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.736
If your heart desires it.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.640
I guess I know your needs
better than these people.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.800
I need to leave.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.976
But for today, meetings of
the Council are scheduled.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.760
I allow you to lead
it in my absence.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.760
But they will want to know where you are.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.320
Tell me I'm on the hunt.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.300
Sire, there's news from our scouts.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.240
Ottomans collect troops.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.440
Let me know when they
advance to Vienna.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.560
Sire, we need to know
where you're going.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
In Virofle saw a boar.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.320
Such a huge beast, just
what the king can kill.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.920
So, I must accompany you.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.720
That is unnecessary.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
What a beautiful fabric,
it is worthy of the queen.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.696
I pray that I will never
wear a dress from her.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.520
I'm sure there will be good hands for her.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.440
Lorren, shut up.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.160
Oh, save me from women in anger.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.320
What should I do?

07:32.600 --> 07:33.880
Wait?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.280
Your fate is in the hands of the king.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.720
If he has not yet sent me to
Spain, then there is still hope.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.560
Everything is possible.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.040
You want to make me feel good,
but do not believe what you say.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
He will still send me there.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.200
If this is his decision,

07:54.200 --> 07:55.600
you will have to leave.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.080
And there to die.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.720
I was told that you are going to leave the country
We have no future here.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.520
Monsieur Cavanel, left all together,
we would be much stronger.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.080
He deprived us of the state.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.400
How many of our friends
have renounced faith?

08:27.520 --> 08:29.360
They burned our bibles

08:29.520 --> 08:30.560
and broke our hearts.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.799
How long will it take before
the king takes our lives?

08:34.559 --> 08:37.440
Exactly. To protect ourselves,
we must stick together.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.760
It is necessary to turn to the cardinal
while he is still at Versailles.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.200
He'll have to listen to us.
And if he does not hear us?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.520
We will protest!

08:45.680 --> 08:47.280
How?

08:47.680 --> 08:50.440
Will you resist?
Apply brute force?

08:50.840 --> 08:53.560
In any case, I'm not going to
wait for Louis to attack us.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.680
I'm not going to tiptoe
before his majesty.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.600
Monsieur Cavanel?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.640
I was not allowed to leave the country.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.000
I knew that I would find
you entertaining yourself.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.720
I enjoy simple pleasures
wherever I can find them.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.520
I need your help.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.240
Than it smelled?
Is it the scent of humility?

09:36.320 --> 09:38.560
I have never been
hostile to you.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.400
But also sympathy too.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.560
Well, what do you want from me now?

09:44.320 --> 09:45.440
Favour?

09:46.160 --> 09:47.320
Not for yourself.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.400
Kavanel was not allowed
to leave for Holland.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.600
The outcome of God's chosen people began.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.320
You have influence in certain circles.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.480
Not anymore, Delphine.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.400
But you have more doors
open than in front of me.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.720
He only needs one signature
on the official document.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.000
I'll have to show my good soul.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.440
I believe that behind the
mask of a superficial person,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
for your intrigues,

10:22.440 --> 10:25.360
hides a man who knows
what justice is.

10:26.920 --> 10:27.920
It's too risky.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.800
The forgery of the signature
is severely punished.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.520
I knew that you -
only an excellent talker,

10:38.760 --> 10:41.040
but I did not think you were a coward.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.680
- I'm a coward?
- Yes.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.360
You could pretend that
you were thinking.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.560
As if there is little
evidence that this is so.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.280
Excuse me... I just do
not like to lift a wave.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.200
I prefer to call myself a pragmatist.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.120
Over time, I learned to respond
to falling opportunities,

11:07.280 --> 11:09.560
It's an instinct for
self-preservation, not cowardice.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.040
Are you going to do
a good deed or not?

11:14.280 --> 11:15.800
What does good deed mean?

11:16.320 --> 11:18.520
I do not have to deal
with Protestants.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.920
I'm afraid for them.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.440
It all starts with burning
books, and ends with people.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.280
And Madame de Maintenon

11:26.640 --> 11:28.080
will give a torch.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.880
This brings us back to
the Delphine papers.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.240
Perhaps under her blanket.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.240
No, thanks, I'll
do something else.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.680
I have more important things to do.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.200
But why postpone?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.720
And I'm thinking about
other strategic goals.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.960
Maybe I should do it.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.160
The last warning, Bastien.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.040
One more delay this week, and
I'll deduct it from your salary.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.560
I went to honour the memory of the dead.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.160
You're sowing troubles...
No.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.560
I say what other people think about.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.800
My employees are happy.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.576
If you oppose the king,
only one of you will win.

12:12.577 --> 12:14.273
Yes. But, at least, I
have the courage to try.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.440
Why engage in a battle whose
outcome is predetermined?

12:16.640 --> 12:19.520
You saw what happened to our people
after the attack on Monsieur Colbert.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.720
You saw what you did to Olivier.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.480
The Lord created the world so at will.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.880
Trying to change things is crazy.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.016
One day the people will start
to fight for their rights.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.760
But, definitely, not in my workshop.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.120
If the king finds out about
the rebels among us,

12:33.360 --> 12:34.736
he will immediately order our arrest.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.520
Do not be late any more.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.880
Are you something better than us?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.840
Now you're one of them, right?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.480
Do not forget, Bastien.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.080
That's enough, Guillaume.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.920
No, I demand respect
in my own workshop.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.680
I have not forgotten where you started.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.440
I know who you are.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.176
But you still bow down before
them, you obey, like a puppet.

12:55.177 --> 12:57.177
How do these dependents in the palace?
Stop it! Go away, and do not come back!

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
Please, Guillaume!

12:59.400 --> 13:01.280
He does not think he's talking.
No, get out.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.280
In the ass, shove your work.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.640
I'd rather eat rats
than work for him.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.440
Let's go, son.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.120
Is she limping?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.120
Damn you!

13:26.800 --> 13:27.640
- Come on!
- No.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.520
Let's ride on my horse.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.960
I can not do it anymore.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.000
I need to sleep.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.600
Okay, let's take a breather.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.920
I will not take my words back.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.960
I did not ask.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.280
Your brother would sell his own mother.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.240
He wanted to give your salary.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.680
It's dirty money.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.720
I know you need them.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.800
What are you going to do now?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.760
As usual. To say
everything I think.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.280
And if they do not listen to you?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.000
I can not stay idle any more.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.760
I need to do something.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.680
Me too.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.120
Will it make me angry?

15:12.880 --> 15:14.880
It is customary to ask for an audience.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.840
Just as it is customary to
believe the king's word.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.880
My troops stumbled upon some
merchant following Malta.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.200
There were spices on board his ship.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.920
Louis signed a trade
agreement with the Ottomans

15:26.080 --> 15:27.520
and won on it millions.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.840
This is trade.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.720
In the business world its rules.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.080
But why now?

15:35.240 --> 15:37.400
What does he give them in return?

15:40.960 --> 15:43.560
The Ottomans deployed their
forces at my borders.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.280
Well, we should prepare to disperse them.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.160
And if Louis is on their side?

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
Too serious charge.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.240
This is a declaration of war.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.000
He preferred the infidels to Rome.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.800
He betrayed me and challenged you.

16:02.960 --> 16:07.400
It's as clear as day that he's
going to take away your power.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.520
Be kind, do not forget
your place, emperor.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.160
Nobody in this world

16:17.200 --> 16:19.160
does not dictate its own
rules of the church.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.800
I'm not going to sleep here.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.800
We have no choice.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.320
But this place looks awful.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.680
Come on. Here.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.800
But animals are sleeping here!
Exactly.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.120
What if there are spiders here?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.800
Believe me, spiders are the least
of your problems. Follow me.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.800
Do you remember when
we last did this?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.640
Only we two.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.880
We could barely
bleach ourselves.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.119
You were afraid of the dark.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.200
This is the constellation of Gemini?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.400
Orion Belt.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.160
The twins are to the east.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.400
Castor and Pollux -

17:30.560 --> 17:32.480
the two brightest stars.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.360
Twins.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.200
How could you believe that I was involved
in the machinations against you?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.760
You never know when
you can trust.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.640
You believe that I made a conspiracy,

17:45.800 --> 17:48.040
secretly killing people to
provoke your aggression?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.360
I did not know what to think.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.440
I knew that a plot was being prepared,
at the top of the government.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.520
And I decided that there is no
one more powerful than you.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
This is the whole point.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.240
This damn church only
creates problems.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.520
What does Summer prepare for us?

18:09.920 --> 18:11.480
He wants to get control over me.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.320
And if it does not work,
he will destroy me.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.520
With the help of our brother.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.440
The lawful king.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.896
If the Vatican achieves its goal,

18:22.720 --> 18:24.960
our lives will never
be the same again.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.160
Our?

18:26.320 --> 18:27.760
That's why I need you.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.320
Because of my goodwill
and analytical mind?

18:31.560 --> 18:32.960
Because of your instinct.

18:33.920 --> 18:34.920
And your big heart.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.160
What kind of person is ready
to kill an innocent woman?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.080
There is no one less
innocent than you.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.640
You used me.
Just like your mother.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.560
- Close eyes.
- No!

19:39.160 --> 19:41.280
- Close!
- Never.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.000
You can not kill me, you
see the love in my eyes.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.360
You are lying.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.520
Yes,

19:49.560 --> 19:52.160
I was an agent of
Emperor Leopold.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.640
Yes, I was intriguing against Louis.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.000
And, yes, I'm in love with you.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.440
And I know you feel it, too.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.240
Tell me I did not
love you in vain.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.720
You deserve more,

20:23.960 --> 20:25.440
than the king thinks.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.400
You are not a heartless dog,

20:27.640 --> 20:29.320
which is subordinate to him in everything.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.160
I can not discuss the king's orders.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.400
If I can not fulfil my destiny,

20:39.240 --> 20:40.920
What is left for me?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.560
You have a heart.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.440
And conscience.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.520
Stay inside for another hour.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.320
And then jump west. Do not stop.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.000
What do you say to the king?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.720
I'm afraid for you.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.680
Think about yourself.
It only matters.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.520
If I ever see you again...

21:55.080 --> 21:57.040
I will fulfil my duty.

22:20.560 --> 22:21.680
I do not have time for this!

22:22.000 --> 22:24.760
If the Parisians are unhappy
with their fate, I do not care.

22:24.920 --> 22:25.920
I should be worried.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.480
You are too bold.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.840
Please accept my sincere apologies.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.440
Monsieur Louvoy, if the king does not do
anything for them, he will pay dearly.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.680
The tax on salt harms the people.
The mood of the masses is changing.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.080
What are you trying to say?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.040
I'm afraid, as it were, to end
a riot against His Majesty.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.240
Warning me, you betray
your own, right?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.120
First of all, I am loyal to the king.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.960
Give me names and addresses,
and we'll arrest them.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.760
Do not ask me about it.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.040
I came to warn the king.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.360
I do not want to
see others suffer.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.800
In that case, your contract
will be terminated.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.200
You are more

23:06.440 --> 23:07.800
do not serve the king.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.640
I see on your shoulders the
weight of state debts.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.080
If only I could help.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.120
- Alas, I and maths have never been...
- What you need?

23:26.440 --> 23:28.000
I wanted to apologize.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.080
For the death of my niece?
Yes.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.320
The moment chosen by
you is very doubtful.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.920
What do you want?

23:36.480 --> 23:38.800
Do you think I'm
so incorrigible?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.720
Nothing speaks in your favour.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.520
I'm sad that your ideas about
human nature are so gloomy.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.240
I wish you a good day.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.600
What is the real reason

23:52.080 --> 23:53.320
your visit?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.960
I wanted to ask you
a little favour.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.280
As far as I can tell, it will
benefit the state treasury.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
But it is not important.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.800
What is it about?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.160
You, of course, know
Monsieur Vanel?

24:14.880 --> 24:15.880
No, who is this?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.280
Confectioner from Lyon.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.440
Gifted.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.440
He wanted to spread
his business abroad.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.600
Very commendable.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.000
Really.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.840
He must sail to England
from Calais next week.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.760
But the paperwork dragged on.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.120
He asked if you could help.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.880
And why should I help him?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.080
Because he is a faithful
servant of the king.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.120
And he, like you, is convinced,

24:41.360 --> 24:43.840
that the future of the country
depends on the success of trade.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.440
What do you expect from me?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.920
Just a confirmation
of his identity.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.880
And free pass guarantees.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.800
Just in case I take the floor,

25:01.400 --> 25:03.560
that his deeds are absolutely legal.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.680
Just in case.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
I give it to you.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.480
Thank you.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.400
And as if by magic,
Vanel becomes...

25:29.640 --> 25:31.160
Cavanelem.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.160
How can I thank you?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.520
Having paid me, my dear.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.200
As you want?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.200
What is the price of freedom?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.560
Well, let's say...

25:51.720 --> 25:53.280
Two thousand? No...

25:53.440 --> 25:54.520
Better than three thousand.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.280
I'll send money

25:57.520 --> 25:58.720
in your chambers.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.160
Are you sure you do not want to go with me?

26:05.160 --> 26:06.160
Yes. My place is here.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.920
Good luck in your new life.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.360
So you demand money from people
who are in desperate situation?

26:21.520 --> 26:23.840
You do not confuse me with a
good Samaritan? - No, but...

26:24.000 --> 26:26.960
I ask for money for the right to survive.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.760
And if you still have
friends who need my help...

26:33.800 --> 26:35.800
you know where to find me.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.200
Madame the Secretary?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.120
I'm sorry, I do
not see anything.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.520
I ask you to,

27:25.120 --> 27:26.360
do not get up.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.040
But I suddenly recognized
the voice of the king.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.160
It looks like the voice
of your precious father.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.800
It is a great honour
to receive you.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.760
My brother and I have a
few questions for you.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.440
Do you remember Louise de Lafayette?

27:51.440 --> 27:52.840
Forgive me, sire.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.120
I occupied a high place at court.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.880
I vowed never to speak
on certain topics.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.480
Even if the king orders you
now to talk about them?

28:05.240 --> 28:07.560
The king was really
attached to her.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.000
Yes, we know that they had a child.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.160
Do not worry.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.400
Do not hurry.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.880
Once

28:26.160 --> 28:28.000
we walked together,

28:28.160 --> 28:29.640
then they just harvested the harvest.

28:30.240 --> 28:34.320
Louise's birth was soon expected,
but the hour had not yet come.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.960
She suddenly sighed in pain.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.720
The blood quickly dyed
the hem of her skirt.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.600
We laid it under a tree.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.520
She cried softly,

28:49.680 --> 28:51.280
but she did not complain about anything,

28:51.320 --> 28:53.040
despite his torment.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.200
And then he was born.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.440
Robert.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.160
He had a birthmark on his face.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.720
Cain's mark.

29:07.880 --> 29:12.520
I still hear his voice, crying out
to heaven with all its might.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.080
But he shouted in vain.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.600
That was his only
and last breath.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.440
He died?

29:26.720 --> 29:28.040
Yes. Oh sure.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.280
Otherwise, Robert would become king.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.280
If Providence had not intervened,

29:35.960 --> 29:37.920
we would have worshipped him.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.000
Why was not he
buried like a king?

29:42.480 --> 29:45.040
But, your highness, it was so.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.800
Go out into the clearing, and go

29:52.040 --> 29:55.240
to the foot of the
cross, the sacred place,

29:55.480 --> 29:56.640
where pilgrims pray.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.760
Turn to the west, where
high walls meet.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.280
Rummage in the ground,

30:12.520 --> 30:15.040
where the old stones lie.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.240
There your poor brother
rests in peace.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.240
Louis de Bourbon and Louise de Lafayette

30:31.400 --> 30:35.360
mourned him, burying his
shameful secret with his son.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.960
They did not want anyone to
doubt the ability of the King

30:40.200 --> 30:41.520
to bring to light the heir.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.720
Louise immediately retired
to live in a monastery.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.600
But the king and the queen
visited her every month to pray

31:00.120 --> 31:02.240
and share the pain of loss.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.440
Madame, who else knew about the baby?

31:14.520 --> 31:16.840
No one except the nearest
encirclement of the king.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.841
Everything was arranged by your
father's personal surgeon.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.920
He did this with extreme
care and caution.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.640
It was his closest confidant,
Jean-Baptiste Bontemps.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.000
Father Bontemps hid
the whole story.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.120
Your closest friend knows
from the beginning.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.720
It is worth to thank him for
keeping the secret of our father.

31:39.722 --> 31:41.198
We can not leave everything like that.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.400
The king had a child. He did not survive.
There is no longer any riddle.

31:44.401 --> 31:45.451
Who is the man in the mask?

31:45.535 --> 31:47.936
I do not know who that is, but he
will not take my throne from me.

31:47.937 --> 31:49.257
But the mystery remained.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.320
We know the most important thing:
I am the rightful king.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.480
How does the Vatican deal with all this?
Perhaps there is no connection.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.400
Perhaps Bontemps does not know anything.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.760
But who told us about Makar?

31:59.920 --> 32:03.200
And who was closest to the
cardinal and di Marco?

32:03.360 --> 32:07.040
And who told us that a man in an
iron mask is just an invention?

32:07.680 --> 32:10.560
If a prisoner is hiding, there
must be some weighty reason.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.720
And Bontemps must know her.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.360
What for

32:25.600 --> 32:28.400
to send this creature
to the colony?

32:28.560 --> 32:31.960
This is the best way to get rid
of the problem once and for all.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.680
He must stay here.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.880
Where we can protect him
and take care of him.

32:37.040 --> 32:40.000
But, remaining in Europe, this
person represents a living threat.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.120
A useful threat.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.720
And how are you going to use him?

32:47.320 --> 32:50.840
We'll take him in case he
needs to convince Louis.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.400
I will not take part in a
conspiracy against the king.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.400
And what did you do all your life?

33:00.040 --> 33:01.680
I defended the king.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.880
Call it whatever you want,

33:05.800 --> 33:07.320
but you will continue to do so.

33:08.160 --> 33:13.000
If only you do not want the king
to know that his closest person

33:13.160 --> 33:14.160
in fact

33:14.520 --> 33:15.760
usual traitor.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.400
And now

33:19.640 --> 33:22.200
I want you to tell me,

33:22.440 --> 33:23.640
where the prisoner is.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.040
Let's stop. I need a rest.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.560
Shall we get there soon?
- No.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.760
Download at the same pace,

33:41.920 --> 33:44.200
and in a few days you will
reach the Dutch border.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.800
What does you mean?

33:46.040 --> 33:48.080
I need to go back and
finish some business.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.240
What are you going to do?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.480
I'll destroy the king.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.960
Sorry?
I will avenge my mother.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.200
But if you return, they will kill you.
I'm ready to take this risk.

33:58.280 --> 34:01.480
Sophie, listen.
You will perish if you turn back.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.640
You're too young to die.
Come with me.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.160
- Together we will remake our lives.
- No.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.719
I can not do anything without you.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.679
No one knows what the future is preparing
for us, but at least we have hope.

34:32.199 --> 34:33.639
And we can rely on each other.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
Speak,

35:36.680 --> 35:38.480
and the Lord will hear you.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.840
I am guilty of lying.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.240
And you regret this lie?

35:48.920 --> 35:50.000
In no case.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.080
But a lie is a sin.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.480
And faithfulness is also a sin?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.600
Fidelity to whom?

36:03.320 --> 36:05.120
A very close person.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.000
The one I love.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.320
Who I respect most in the world.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.360
I wanted to protect him,

36:15.120 --> 36:16.560
keeping a secret,

36:16.720 --> 36:18.800
who could have killed him.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.280
Some are ready to take advantage
of this secret against my master.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.280
If you really love your master,

36:29.720 --> 36:32.240
you will find a way to stop them.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.440
What decision I would take,

36:38.680 --> 36:40.760
troubles can not be avoided.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.960
Well, did you find them?

36:46.880 --> 36:49.720
In the monastery on the
way to Aix-la-Chapelle.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.960
AND?

36:55.160 --> 36:56.680
It belonged to the princess Eleanor.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.680
And the Duchess of Kassel?

36:58.840 --> 37:01.160
She will not give you
any more trouble, sir.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.920
I knew that I could rely on you.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.440
Tell Bontemps I want
to talk to him.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.200
Have you found your brother?

37:15.680 --> 37:16.920
Yes. In one clearing.

37:17.720 --> 37:18.880
And?

37:19.600 --> 37:22.600
He has long been dead.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.520
And the man in the iron mask?
It's still a mystery.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.920
And Bontemps is the key to the solution.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.560
Are you sure?

37:33.960 --> 37:35.400
He knows something.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.360
Find it.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.120
I assure you, we will do
everything in our power,

37:45.280 --> 37:49.200
to find the guilty.
We will torture them and then execute them.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.160
You will easily find them.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.160
Why?

37:53.880 --> 37:55.080
Because they were your people.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.840
Do you think I'm capable of
killing a young innocent woman?

38:00.440 --> 38:02.680
I believe you are capable of anything.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.320
You blame me for the tragedy,
which they themselves provoked.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.400
I did not let her escape.

38:07.401 --> 38:10.537
And certainly not I pushed her into the
clutches of bandits from the big road.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.040
How dare you?
- Gentlemen!

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
Your Majesty,

38:16.520 --> 38:18.720
I insist that you return
to your quarters.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.880
I must discuss important
questions with the king.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.160
Now that the princess is dead,

38:39.960 --> 38:44.480
you undoubtedly want me to approve
of the marriage of Charles

38:44.640 --> 38:46.040
and your niece?

38:47.600 --> 38:50.280
Of course, if you think
this is possible.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.440
I do not think so.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.280
Your claims to
Spain are illegal.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.760
You betrayed the Vatican.
This is ridiculous.

38:57.920 --> 39:02.320
We know about your arrangements
with Ottoman heretics.

39:02.960 --> 39:03.960
What arrangements?

39:04.360 --> 39:07.280
Trade agreement in
exchange for Austria.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.200
And how does the invasion of Ottomans
in Austria affect the Vatican?

39:10.360 --> 39:11.720
Do not abuse my patience.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.976
Austria - a checkpoint, which directly
leads to the Holy Roman Empire.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.880
If the Muslims enter Vienna,
they will not stop there.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.400
Your Eminence, I promise you,

39:19.560 --> 39:22.720
that no Muslim will step on the
land belonging to the Vatican.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.960
Your word has lost all value, Louis.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.440
In that case, I will continue
without your support.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.240
Are you defying the church?
Yes.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.440
This is a declaration of war.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.080
I do not advise you to enter
into war with me, Your Eminence.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.840
As for me, I do not advise
playing with me, Louis,

39:49.080 --> 39:50.560
the king of France.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.480
You have an army,

39:53.200 --> 39:54.560
but I have a weapon,

39:54.720 --> 39:57.640
which can destroy your empire
even before it is built.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.720
Are you threatening me?

40:02.240 --> 40:04.080
I'm not threatening you.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.800
Who in such a case?

40:07.440 --> 40:08.960
Soon you will find out.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.120
Find Monsieur Bontemps.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.240
Tell him that I want to see him.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.640
Immediately.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.440
Monsieur?

40:30.600 --> 40:33.120
Found him?
He was seen in the stable.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.360
From the day of the ascension to the throne

40:51.600 --> 40:53.920
I was helped by wise counsel

40:54.080 --> 40:55.720
and reasonable plans.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.720
I established good
relations with neighbours,

41:00.880 --> 41:04.160
signed agreements and always
asked the Vatican's opinion.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.280
These times have passed.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.840
Spain, Strasbourg and
Luxembourg will now become my

41:14.680 --> 41:17.240
Sire, you're talking about open war now.
Exactly.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.400
I admit that I admire the
incredible boldness of His Majesty

41:24.360 --> 41:25.680
and his ambitions.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.240
But it would not be more wisdom

41:28.480 --> 41:30.920
limit oneself to
agreements and diplomacy?

41:31.160 --> 41:32.520
The days of diplomacy have passed!

41:33.080 --> 41:35.080
From this day on, France
is fighting alone.

41:35.440 --> 41:39.280
Our only allies will be courage
and our unlimited power.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.800
Stop worrying.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.560
Fabien will find it and bring it to us.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.640
Well.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.000
Where's the young wife?

42:46.760 --> 42:49.480
My niece just died...

42:50.280 --> 42:52.480
Lord courtiers,

42:53.240 --> 42:56.160
I ask you to greet my
niece, Maria Louise,

42:56.720 --> 42:58.800
the future queen of Spain.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.720
I was informed that the Ottoman
troops are on their way.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.080
You must return and
protect your country.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.200
Beware of underestimating it.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.640
Beware of underestimating
the power of the church.

43:46.160 --> 43:50.040
Your Eminence. Cousin.
Let's go together for mass?

43:50.041 --> 43:52.157
That's kind of you, but it's
time for me to go home.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.800
Some cases await my intervention.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.920
Of course. I hope that
our next meeting will

43:56.945 --> 43:58.904
take place under more
pleasant circumstances.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.520
I doubt it. Good-bye, Louis.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.000
It seems everyone is leaving.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.080
Except me.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.720
You were sent to kill me?

44:56.880 --> 44:58.840
If this were so,
you would be dead.

44:59.200 --> 45:00.920
Do not provoke me!

45:02.760 --> 45:05.200
Bravado does not suit you, Bontemps.

45:05.360 --> 45:08.240
Lower the dagger, and
return to Versailles.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.720
It's impossible.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.480
Why is that?

45:11.640 --> 45:14.320
Why are you here?
You betray the king?

45:14.480 --> 45:16.400
No, I protect him.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.520
The only person you
defend is yourself.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.040
Listen to me!

45:20.200 --> 45:22.400
The forces of evil do their dark deeds.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.520
They're going to destroy the crown!

45:29.840 --> 45:32.080
Are you really holding onto me as an idiot?

45:32.320 --> 45:34.120
Do you really hold my traitor?

45:37.800 --> 45:39.800
We have known each other
for a long time, Marshal.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.880
It does not matter what
happened between us,

45:43.040 --> 45:45.160
one thing will remain unchanged.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.240
Our loyalty to the King.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.120
Found him?

45:59.280 --> 46:00.440
No, your Eminence.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.440
Prepare my crew.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.040
Who goes?

46:15.200 --> 46:16.920
Alexander Bontemps.

46:20.880 --> 46:24.360
We came to give the prisoner
a message from the cardinal.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.120
You came to kill me?

46:43.480 --> 46:45.640
Your journey has come to an end.

47:08.440 --> 47:09.880
There is no need, your Highness.

47:10.040 --> 47:12.040
What are you playing?
Answer, Bontemps!

47:13.880 --> 47:17.120
You lied! You betrayed your king!
Let him tell him.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.160
Everything I did was done
for your protection, sir.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
Do not believe what
you want to convince.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.480
Who wants?

47:26.280 --> 47:27.280
Church?

47:27.520 --> 47:31.040
It was a secret, but
now it's a curse.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.120
I need the truth.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.080
Immediately.

48:17.320 --> 48:19.160
It is a pity that I had
to disappoint you.

48:20.600 --> 48:23.000
Have you waited for someone else?

49:05.760 --> 49:07.240
This is a dream?

49:08.040 --> 49:11.200
No. And your greatest
desire is finally realized.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.360
Remove the mask.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.520
Who you are?

49:52.560 --> 49:54.720
I am called the Duke de Sullan.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.120
I'm a man without a name.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.040
Tell me your real name.

50:01.200 --> 50:04.320
It's not my name that
matters, but who I am.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.280
Then tell me who you are?

50:13.760 --> 50:15.400
I am your father.
