A LOT OF MONEY.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.424

IN AN ALLEY IN EAST AUSTIN

11:26.424 --> 11:28.992
ABOUT FOUR HOURS AGO --
GUNSHOT TO THE HEAD.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.777
HIS WATCH AND WALLET
WERE MISSING,

11:30.777 --> 11:32.866
SO THEY ASSUMED
IT WAS A ROBBERY GONE BAD.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.345
ANY SIGNS
OF THE BRIEFCASE?

11:34.345 --> 11:36.391
NONE. AND WE HAD
HIS APARTMENT SEARCHED.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.566

AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW

WHO HIRED KOCH
TO GET THE BRIEFCASE.

IT'S A TRANSCRIPT

12:06.073 --> 12:07.988
FROM LUIS CRUZ'S TRIAL
FOR MURDER.

12:07.988 --> 12:08.989
GOOD READ?

12:08.989 --> 12:10.817
IT'S A LITTLE DRY.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.383
CRUZ WAS A DRUG ADDICT.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.907
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER,

12:13.907 --> 12:15.735
HE SAID
THAT HE WAS ALONE, USING.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.737
NO ONE TO CONFIRM IT.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.826
THE D.A.
HAD CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

12:19.826 --> 12:21.610
AND A PIECE
OF LUIS' CLOTHING

12:21.610 --> 12:23.481
WITH THE DEAD WOMAN'S
BLOOD ON IT.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.874
THE BLOOD CLINCHED IT.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.181
YES, WELL,
BLOOD'S VERY EASY TO PLANT.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.444
CHILDISHLY EASY, REALLY.YES, IT IS.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.576
YOU DON'T THINK CRUZ DID IT?
WHY?

12:31.576 --> 12:34.797
WELL, IT'S JUST A FEELING
THAT I CAN'T SHAKE.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.581
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:36.581 --> 12:40.150
WELL, DAVID RONALDO WAS LOOKING
FOR EVIDENCE TO CLEAR CRUZ.

12:40.150 --> 12:43.066
HE WAS KILLED AND HAD
SOMETHING STOLEN FROM HIM.

12:43.066 --> 12:46.461
THAT PRETTY STRONGLY SUGGESTS
THAT HE WAS ONTO SOMETHING.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.855
WHICH MEANS THAT,
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

12:48.855 --> 12:51.901
THE STATE OF TEXAS IS GOING
TO EXECUTE AN INNOCENT MAN.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.598
AND ONCE HE'S DEAD,

12:53.598 --> 12:56.950
THERE'S VERY LITTLE INCENTIVE
TO REOPEN THE CASE...

12:56.950 --> 12:58.952
WHICH
THE REAL KILLER KNOWS.

12:58.952 --> 13:02.738

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT ALL THIS?

[ CHUCKLES ]

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
14 YEARS AGO, LUIS CRUZ
WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING

13:15.838 --> 13:18.058
THIS WOMAN --
SARAH FEINBERG.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.711
SHE WAS SHOT TO DEATH
IN HER HOME,

13:19.711 --> 13:21.452
APPARENTLY BY AN INTRUDER.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.847
HER BODY WAS FOUND
BY HER HUSBAND, EDWARD FEINBERG.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.154
EDWARD WAS A PSYCHIATRIST

13:27.154 --> 13:29.330
AT THE UNIVERSITY
TEACHING HOSPITAL.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.549
HE FOUND HIS WIFE'S BODY
WHEN HE ARRIVED HOME

13:31.549 --> 13:32.986
LATER THAT NIGHT.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.639
ANYTHING CONNECTING CRUZ
TO THE FEINBERGS?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.206
YES.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.686

13:37.686 --> 13:39.993
FROM A HALFWAY-HOUSE
DRUG-TREATMENT PROGRAM

13:39.993 --> 13:41.211
THAT FEINBERG RAN.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.823
CRUZ AND FEINBERG
HAD AN ARGUMENT

13:43.823 --> 13:46.347
BECAUSE CRUZ SHOWED UP
TO A THERAPY SESSION HIGH

13:46.347 --> 13:47.696
THREE DAYS
BEFORE THE MURDER.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.002
AND THE D.A. CLAIMED

13:49.002 --> 13:50.786
THAT THAT MADE CRUZ
KILL SARAH FEINBERG?

13:50.786 --> 13:51.918
THAT'S THIN.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.484
WHAT PUT CRUZ
AT THE MURDER SCENE?

13:53.484 --> 13:54.964
THEY FOUND
A SWEATSHIRT OF CRUZ'S

13:54.964 --> 13:56.574
SNAGGED ON A BUSH
OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE

13:56.574 --> 13:58.185
WITH SARAH FEINBERG'S BLOOD
ON IT.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.404
THERE WAS ALSO GUNPOWDER
ON ONE SLEEVE.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.231
WHAT ABOUT THE GUN?

14:01.231 --> 14:02.319
THEY DIDN'T FIND IT.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.408
IT'S 10:00.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.673
Patrick: 10:00.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.328
WE BELIEVE
THAT DAVID RONALDO WAS MURDERED

14:11.328 --> 14:14.766
BECAUSE HE HAD EVIDENCE
THAT WOULD CLEAR LUIS CRUZ.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.681
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT WAS.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.206
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING
TO EXECUTE CRUZ

14:19.206 --> 14:23.166

WE SHOULD HURRY UP.

IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE

MADE A MISTAKE?

14:28.389 --> 14:29.869
NOT THAT I CAN POINT TO.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.740

14:31.740 --> 14:33.133

WHY WE'RE TAKING THIS ON?

I-I DON'T WANT TO SOUND COLD,
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

14:37.920 --> 14:39.966
THAT THE SYSTEM DID
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.445

NO, IT DIDN'T.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.447

IS INNOCENT.

OF THAT?

OF ANYTHING.

HE WAS LOOKING
FOR THE GUN.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.163

20:52.163 --> 20:53.991
WELL, THE POLICE
STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE GUN

20:53.991 --> 20:55.384
THAT KILLED SARAH FEINBERG.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.777
THIS MAP
SHOWS ALL THE BODIES OF WATER

20:56.777 --> 20:58.518
WITHIN A 50-MILE RADIUS
OF THE CRIME SCENE.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.129

PLANNED ON DIVING THEM ALL

21:01.129 --> 21:03.479
ONE BY ONE
IN THE HOPES OF FINDING IT.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.481
AND WHY WOULD HE THINK
THE GUN WAS THROWN
INTO A BODY OF WATER?

21:05.481 --> 21:07.831
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE DID.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.965
AND THAT IS WHY THE KILLER
WANTED HIS BRIEFCASE --

21:10.965 --> 21:13.141
TO SEE HOW FAR RONALDO
HAD GOTTEN WITH HIS PLAN.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.143
THAT'S A PRETTY DESPERATE MOVE
ON RONALDO'S PART.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.972

DESCRIBES THE WHOLE SITUATION.

I MEAN,
IT'S ALWAYS THE HUSBAND, RIGHT?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.642
BUT IN THIS CASE,
IT'S NOT.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.952
I DIDN'T MURDER MY WIFE.YES, YOU DID.

THEN YOU GOT IN YOUR CAR AND
YOU DROVE BACK TO YOUR OFFICE.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.609
YOU STOPPED ON THE WAY
AND YOU DUMPED THE GUN.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.524
NOW, YOU COULD HAVE
DUMPED IT ANYWHERE,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.613

WELL, YOU TELL ME.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.328
I WILL.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.286

25:49.286 --> 25:50.636
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

25:50.636 --> 25:51.941

ONCE HE STARTED
TAKING DIVING LESSONS.

WOULD BE SURPRISED

WHAT THE FBI CAN DO
WITH SERIAL NUMBERS.

26:17.053 --> 26:20.143
AND, OF COURSE, IT DOES PROVE
LUIS CRUZ'S INNOCENCE

BECAUSE THE TIMELINE SUGGESTS
THAT THERE WAS NO WAY

THAT HE COULD DUMP THE GUN
ANYWHERE
