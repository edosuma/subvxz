08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
I CAN'T.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.233
OH, COME ON, YOU WIMP.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.300
NOW PUSH.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.600
SERGIO COULD.
NUNZIO COULD.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.100
NUNZIO!

09:01.900 --> 09:04.033
Shawn:
THAT'S ONE.

09:04.033 --> 09:07.400
PHEW.
OK, YOUR TURN.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.200
[EAST EUROPEAN ACCENT]
THAT WAS A GOOD REP.
YOU DID NOT GIVE UP ON IT.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.667
THANK YOU.

09:13.734 --> 09:16.800
COR, WE TRUST
OUR GIRLS, RIGHT?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.000
OF COURSE,
WE TRUST THEM.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.900
THAT'S WHY I'M
GOING TO CALL
TOPANGA.

09:20.900 --> 09:21.967
AAH!

09:21.967 --> 09:23.000
SHE WON'T GET MAD?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.233
NO, NO.
SHE'LL BE FLATTERED.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.300
WOMEN LOVE THAT
KIND OF ATTENTION.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.567
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE
DONE WITH TOPANGA,
PUT ANGELA ON.

09:30.567 --> 09:32.300
I WA-WANT TO FLATTER
HER, TOO.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.300
Phone:<i>HOLA.</i>
<i>THIS IS NUNZIO.</i>

09:35.300 --> 09:36.467
HELLO, NUNZIO.

09:36.467 --> 09:37.867
EL COYOTE
IS NOW CLOSED.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.100
IF THIS IS FOR
RESERVATIONS,

09:39.100 --> 09:41.467
PLEASE CALL TOMORROW
DURING NORMAL
BUSINESS HOURS.

09:41.467 --> 09:45.400
IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT
ME, TOPANGA, SERGIO,
OR ANGELA,

09:45.400 --> 09:48.667
YOU CAN REACH US
AT THE BOOM BOOM ROOM
AT 438--

09:52.667 --> 09:54.734
Topanga: THANKS, GUYS.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.233
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

09:58.233 --> 09:59.300
NO, HERE'S
A BETTER QUESTION.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.800
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.600
I LIVE HERE.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.700
WELL, IF YOU LIVE HERE,

10:04.700 --> 10:07.100
WHY AREN'T YOU INSIDE
AT 12:00 AT NIGHT?

10:07.100 --> 10:09.700
WELL, WE WORKED LATE,
AND A BUNCH OF US
WENT OUT.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.567
I KNOW, TOPANGA,
BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CALL ME.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.400
I DID CALL YOU.
YOUR MOM SAID YOU
WERE OUT FOR THE EVENING.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.133
OH, WHERE DID YOU GO,
DANCING?

10:16.133 --> 10:19.700
YES, CORY. I LIKE IT,
ESPECIALLY AFTER A LONG
NIGHT AT WORK.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.934
OK.
IT HELPS ME UNWIND.

10:20.934 --> 10:22.033
OH, OK.
SO CORY'S NOT HOME.

10:22.033 --> 10:25.834
YOU RUN OFF WITH NUNZIO
TO THE BOOM BOOM ROOM.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.133
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I WAS AT
THE BOOM BOOM ROOM?

10:28.133 --> 10:30.100
I CALLED
THE RESTAURANT, OK.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.133
IT WAS ON THE MACHINE.

10:31.133 --> 10:33.767
SO YOU WERE
CHECKING UP ON ME?

10:33.767 --> 10:36.133
NO. I--NO.

10:36.133 --> 10:39.900
I WAS CHECKING ON
TOMORROW'S SPECIAL.

10:39.900 --> 10:44.000
I MEAN, THE SEAFOOD
ENCHILADA FOR $3.50?
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.967
I MEAN, THE SHRIMP--
IT'S SO BIG.

10:46.967 --> 10:49.700
CORY, I DON'T LIKE
THIS JEALOUS
SIDE OF YOU.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.600
NUNZIO IS JUST A FRIEND
WHO LIKES TO DANCE.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.934
I'VE ASKED YOU
TO TAKE ME DANCING
A MILLION TIMES.

10:54.934 --> 10:56.734
OH, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

10:56.734 --> 10:59.000
I FORBID YOU
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.367
I'M GOING TO BED.

11:03.367 --> 11:05.233
I FORBID YOU TO GO
TO BED.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.700
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T GET WOMEN.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.367
UGH. WHY CAN'T THEY
BE MORE LIKE MEN?

11:25.367 --> 11:26.500
YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.300
THERE'D BE A LOT LESS
EMMA THOMPSON MOVIES.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.667
HI, GUYS.

11:31.667 --> 11:32.667
HI, SONJA.

11:32.667 --> 11:33.967
HEY, COOKIE.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
LOOKING GOOD.
GO FOR THE BURN.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.600
COR, LET'S TRY
TO FIGURE
THIS THING OUT.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
THE GIRLS
WANT TO DANCE

11:43.600 --> 11:45.667
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.100
AND WE WANT
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

11:48.100 --> 11:52.400
OK. THERE'S GOT TO BE
A SIMPLE SOLUTION
TO ALL OF THIS.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.800
ANYTHING?
NOTHING.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.133
WAIT!
HERE IT COMES. OK.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.800
THE GIRLS TALK ABOUT
HOW IT'S OK TO HAVE
GUYS WHO ARE JUST...

12:13.800 --> 12:15.200
"FRIENDS."

12:15.200 --> 12:19.000
WELL, WHAT IF WE GOT
OURSELVES A COUPLE
OF GIRLS WHO ARE JUST...

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
"FRIENDS"?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.400
CORY,
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.000
THAT'S THE
SIMPLE SOLUTION.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.033
YOU KNOW WHAT, SHAWN?

12:24.033 --> 12:25.900
I'VE GOT A STRANGE
CRAVING FOR MEXICAN.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.600
OH, OH, OH.
I AM RIGHT WITH YOU.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.934
YOU THINK
THEY DELIVER?

12:33.400 --> 12:37.667
I TOLD SHAWN SERGIO
AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS,

12:37.667 --> 12:39.567
AND HE PRACTICALLY
CALLED ME A LIAR.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.100
CORY DID THE EXACT SAME
THING TO ME.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.734
IT'S LIKE
THEY'RE SHARING A BRAIN,

12:43.734 --> 12:45.400
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR ONE.

12:45.400 --> 12:50.100
HAVING FRIENDS
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX
IS SUCH A SIMPLE IDEA.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.400
WHY CAN'T
THEY GET IT?

12:51.400 --> 12:54.100
BECAUSE SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF TIME,

12:54.100 --> 12:55.400
MEN HAVE BEEN IDIOTS.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.567
THIS WILL NEVER CHANGE.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.133
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

12:58.133 --> 13:01.667
IF MY GIRLFRIEND WENT
OUT DANCING WITH SOMEBODY
WHO LOOKED LIKE ME,

13:01.667 --> 13:04.500
I WOULD BE INSANE
AS WELL.

13:04.500 --> 13:08.400
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
BE A LITTLE MORE
UNDERSTANDING.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.200
YEAH, WE DID KIND
OF THROW SERGIO AND
NUNZIO IN THEIR FACES.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.967
OH, THAT
HAS GOT TO HURT.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.967
MAYBE WE SHOULD CUT
THEM SOME SLACK.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.400
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.367
OK, LADIES, ORDER
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.567
OK, WHEN YOU'RE
OUT WITH US,

13:22.567 --> 13:23.867
CALORIES DON'T COUNT.

13:23.867 --> 13:26.767
OH, CHIMICHANGAS,
HERE I COME.

13:27.834 --> 13:28.834
NUNZIO?

13:28.834 --> 13:32.667
NOT EVEN NUNZIO
COULD HELP YOU NOW.

13:32.667 --> 13:33.934
HI, GUYS.

13:33.934 --> 13:36.200
TOPANGA, COME HERE.
WE WANT YOU TO MEET
OUR FRIENDS.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.500
OK, THIS IS COOKIE
AND SONJA.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.400
SONJA CAN BENCH
PRESS 300 POUNDS.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.367
HMM, THAT'S
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.400
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.500
THANK YOU.
BRING ME A COLA.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.400
YOU GOT IT.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.834
AH, TOPANGA,
TOPANGA.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.467
YOU DIDN'T TELL US
WHAT YOU THINK OF
OUR FRIENDS.

13:56.467 --> 13:57.667
OH, GOOD ONE.

13:57.667 --> 14:01.467
WELL, THEY SEEM
LIKE VERY NICE,
ATTRACTIVE,

14:01.467 --> 14:02.900
WELL-TONED GIRLS.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.400
AH,
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.300
AH HA.
YOU ARE THE MAN.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.133
HOW DUMB ARE YOU?

14:09.133 --> 14:10.767
ALMOST AS DUMB
AS CORY.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.033
I TOLD HIM
IT WOULD BACKFIRE.

14:14.033 --> 14:18.300
SO, UH, DID CORY
TELL YOU WHY EXACTLY
YOU WERE HERE?

14:18.300 --> 14:20.600
HE SAID WE WOULD
HAVE A ROMANTIC
DINNER,

14:20.600 --> 14:23.100
AND I COULD
MAYBE GET
MY GREEN CARD.

14:23.100 --> 14:27.767
I'M PRETTY SURE
I SAID GREETING CARD.

14:27.767 --> 14:31.100
THEY BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO MAKE US,

14:31.100 --> 14:33.033
THEIR GIRLFRIENDS,
JEALOUS.

14:33.033 --> 14:35.667
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH YOUR COLA.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.600
SO...

14:37.600 --> 14:40.100
YOU'RE
JUST USING US?

14:40.100 --> 14:41.100
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

14:41.100 --> 14:43.233
I JUST DON'T GET LUCY,
YOU KNOW?

14:43.233 --> 14:44.233
I CALL HER UP,

14:44.233 --> 14:45.567
SHE SAYS
SHE'S SICK IN BED,

14:45.567 --> 14:47.600
AND CHICKEN SOUP WILL
MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.000
I SAID IT PROBABLY WOULD.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.734
THEN I WENT BOWLING.

14:51.567 --> 14:54.200
NOW SHE'S MAD AT ME.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.667
MAYBE SHE WANTED
YOU TO BRING HER
THE CHICKEN SOUP.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.867
WELL, WHY DIDN'T
SHE JUST SAY SO?

15:01.867 --> 15:05.000
WOMEN, MAN.
THEY SPEAK IN CODE.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.600
HEY, MR. FEENY?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.467
HOW DID YOUR DATE
GO WITH KATHY?

15:08.467 --> 15:11.300
WELL, IT SEEMED TO BE
GOING QUITE WELL.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.934
I MEAN,
SHE EVEN INVITED ME
INTO HER HOME.

15:13.934 --> 15:18.667
OH...GO FEENY.
GO FEENY. HUH?

15:18.667 --> 15:24.033
SHE READ ME SOME
OF HER POETRY AND
ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT.

15:24.033 --> 15:25.300
AND I TOLD HER.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.734
WELL, YOU...I MEAN,
YOU TOLD HER YOU
LOVED IT, RIGHT?

15:28.734 --> 15:31.934
I SAID IT WAS PROMISING
FOR A BEGINNER.

15:31.934 --> 15:35.467
SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN
WRITING FOR 20 YEARS.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.967
AND HERE I AM.

15:38.967 --> 15:40.600
OK, UM, SEE...

15:40.600 --> 15:42.033
THAT'S NOT WHAT
SHE WANTED TO HEAR.

15:42.033 --> 15:45.000
WELL, THEN,
WHY DID SHE ASK?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.867
HE'S BEEN
CHICKEN-SOUPED.

15:46.867 --> 15:47.867
Amy: ALAN!

15:47.867 --> 15:50.300
IT'S ME OR
THAT SATELLITE DISH.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.934
YOU MAKE THE CHOICE.

15:57.734 --> 16:00.400
HEY, GUYS.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.967
ANGELA DOESN'T
EVEN GET ME.

16:02.967 --> 16:06.734
IT'S LIKE TOPANGA AND ME
ARE SPEAKING DIFFERENT
LANGUAGES.

16:06.734 --> 16:09.500
WELL, ONE
THING'S OBVIOUS.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
IT'S NOT US.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.700
IT'S THEM.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.033
YEAH.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.100
WELL, NOW,
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.000
MAYBE WE SHOULD
ALL JUST...

16:16.000 --> 16:17.500
THINK A SECOND.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.000
NO. SHAWN AND I
TRIED THAT.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.867
OK, I'VE BEEN SILENT
LONG ENOUGH.

16:23.867 --> 16:27.600
GUYS, I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON A THEORY.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.700
MEN...ARE IDIOTS.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.700
WHAT?
WHAT?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.033
NO, WAIT,
THERE'S MORE.

16:34.033 --> 16:35.667
ALL RIGHT, THERE IT IS.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.900
MEN ARE BIG IDIOTS.

16:39.967 --> 16:40.967
OH.
OH.

16:40.967 --> 16:41.967
YEAH,
SEE THAT?

16:41.967 --> 16:44.000
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

16:45.400 --> 16:50.500
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
WE SHOULD JUST TRY
LISTENING TO THEM.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.300
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.834
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.
SORRY.

16:55.834 --> 17:00.667
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY CORY'S
THINKING THING AGAIN.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.500
WHAT IS THE MATTER
TONIGHT, TOPANGA?

17:14.500 --> 17:19.100
YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING
NUNZIO AS I AM
ENJOYING NUNZIO.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.100
IT'S CORY.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.033
HE HASN'T CALLED ME
IN 2 DAYS.

17:22.033 --> 17:24.200
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE
IF HE WON'T DANCE.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
I MISS HIM.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.200
HE MISSES YOU, TOO.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.100
OF THIS I AM SURE.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.767
I JUST CALLED
THE APARTMENT AGAIN.

17:31.767 --> 17:32.767
THEY'RE NOT THERE.

17:32.767 --> 17:33.967
OF COURSE,
THEY'RE NOT THERE.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.667
OF THIS I AM SURE.

17:36.734 --> 17:39.734
OH, TOPANGA.
THIS IS GREAT.

17:39.734 --> 17:40.734
THANK YOU.

17:40.734 --> 17:42.300
MR. MATTHEWS
IS OK WITH THIS?

17:42.300 --> 17:45.734
OH, HE IS SO STUCK
IN FRONT OF THAT
SATELLITE TV,

17:45.734 --> 17:47.500
HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW I'M HERE.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.033
OH, HE KNOWS YOU
ARE HERE.

17:49.033 --> 17:51.033
OF THIS I AM SURE.

17:51.033 --> 17:54.133
KATHERINE? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

17:54.133 --> 17:55.667
OH, I LOVE DANCING.

17:55.667 --> 17:59.900
I WISH THERE WAS
A WAY TO GET
YOUR NEIGHBOR HERE.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.000
COME ON, TOPANGA.
I MISS SHAWN, TOO,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.834
BUT LET'S JUST TRY
TO HAVE FUN.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.967
I CAN'T HAVE FUN.
I REALLY WANT
TO BE WITH CORY.

18:07.967 --> 18:11.400
WHY DO MEN HAVE
TO BE SO STUBBORN?

18:12.967 --> 18:15.000
LADIES?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
HELLO.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.200
SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF TIME,

18:18.200 --> 18:19.300
MEN...

18:19.300 --> 18:21.600
HAVE BEEN IDIOTS.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.000
THIS WILL
MAKE UP FOR IT.
