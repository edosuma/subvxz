WEBVTT

00:10.460 --> 00:13.928
I really, really hope they don't live here.

00:13.930 --> 00:17.231
I seen my son in the air
by the back of his shirt.

00:17.233 --> 00:20.905
This poltergeist has some juice.

00:20.907 --> 00:22.242
I understand it was a shootout, though.

00:22.244 --> 00:24.679
They opened fire and
three deputies were killed.

00:24.681 --> 00:27.451
This thing is, mm, not good.

00:27.453 --> 00:30.323
I never been through this. I
never experienced this before.

00:30.325 --> 00:33.320
He says, "I'm gonna get ya."

00:33.730 --> 00:36.799
It's like somebody's
into some dark [bleep].

00:38.267 --> 00:40.203
You're mine you can't escape.

00:40.228 --> 00:42.562
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.468 --> 00:45.185
What's happening?

00:45.210 --> 00:47.179
I see dead people.

00:47.204 --> 00:48.740
It seems like a devil.

00:48.765 --> 00:50.734
I speak to dead people.

00:50.773 --> 00:52.439
He's pissed off.

00:52.441 --> 00:53.673
And they speak to me.

00:53.675 --> 00:55.675
I felt real fear.

00:55.677 --> 00:58.849
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.620
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.622 --> 01:02.223
I rely on my partner.

01:02.225 --> 01:03.759
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.761 --> 01:06.095
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:06.097 --> 01:07.598
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.968
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.370
Nobody believes me.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.906
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.877
- You think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.879 --> 01:17.547
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.549 --> 01:19.650
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.652 --> 01:21.153
Until the very end.

01:21.155 --> 01:22.825
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.827 --> 01:24.795
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.797 --> 01:26.731
This is our house, whether
they like it or not.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.430
Or time to get out.

01:28.637 --> 01:31.242
This is their house...
the house of the dead.

01:51.175 --> 01:52.409
I'm in Florida City.

01:52.411 --> 01:54.478
It's about 45 minutes south of Miami.

01:54.955 --> 01:56.555
I got a call from a married couple,

01:56.557 --> 01:57.893
Tracy and Travas.

01:57.895 --> 02:00.529
The family's so scared by
what's happening in the house,

02:00.531 --> 02:02.832
every night they grab their three kids,

02:02.834 --> 02:05.702
and they huddle in the same room
together till the sun comes up.

02:05.704 --> 02:07.473
It broke my heart listening to their story.

02:07.556 --> 02:09.824
I'm really hoping Amy
and I can help them out.

02:15.579 --> 02:17.213
Since Amy can see two worlds,

02:17.215 --> 02:20.185
this one has to be free
of any leading information.

02:20.383 --> 02:22.650
Family photos, trophies and personal items

02:22.652 --> 02:24.586
can influence her findings

02:24.588 --> 02:26.655
so it's important I
cover or remove them all

02:26.657 --> 02:28.155
before she begins her walk.

02:41.308 --> 02:43.072
Oh, boy.

02:43.074 --> 02:44.935
Hmm.

02:45.946 --> 02:48.149
Right away, there were, like,

02:48.151 --> 02:51.954
several dead people on
the other side of the door

02:51.956 --> 02:56.993
piling up on each other,
desperate to get out.

02:56.995 --> 02:58.863
So, there's something going on here

02:58.865 --> 03:02.701
that's preventing them from leaving.

03:03.706 --> 03:07.639
It's like somebody's into
some dark [bleep], I think.

03:08.346 --> 03:10.347
I do get something with witchcraft.

03:19.453 --> 03:21.292
Now, Tracy, when we spoke on the phone,

03:21.294 --> 03:22.827
you sounded pretty bad.

03:22.829 --> 03:24.563
Tell me again exactly what's going on.

03:24.565 --> 03:27.568
There's a lot of different apparitions,

03:27.570 --> 03:30.468
a lot of touching, bruises...

03:30.470 --> 03:32.238
attacks.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.740
How long have you guys been livin here?

03:33.742 --> 03:35.942
It's been a year now. Why'd you move?

03:35.944 --> 03:39.041
Just so my kids could have their own room.

03:39.712 --> 03:44.049
But seems like I've moved
here to live in a one-bedroom,

03:44.051 --> 03:46.485
because they're too afraid
to sleep in their own room.

03:48.554 --> 03:50.986
Now, who exactly is living in the house?

03:51.692 --> 03:53.496
My husband,

03:54.460 --> 03:56.361
my daughter... she's 13...

03:56.363 --> 03:59.731
my son Travis, he's eight years old.

03:59.733 --> 04:02.224
And the baby, he's two.

04:02.249 --> 04:04.839
Okay. You told me on the phone
you did a blessing on the house.

04:04.841 --> 04:05.851
Yes, I have.

04:05.876 --> 04:08.785
When I first came, the
landlord actually told me

04:08.810 --> 04:10.743
that she's been saging the house.

04:10.745 --> 04:12.511
Why would the landlord tell you that?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.179
At the time when I moved in,

04:14.181 --> 04:16.416
I didn't think about
it when she told me that

04:16.418 --> 04:19.214
because I was just so
excited to be in a home.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.515
So, I continue saging the house.

04:21.517 --> 04:24.416
It seems like everything
just got worse after then.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.250
It's not right what's going on here.

04:36.896 --> 04:38.963
There's [bleep] going on all over here.

04:38.965 --> 04:40.664
This is insane.

04:40.666 --> 04:44.802
I'm seeing this woman and
this man who lived here.

04:44.804 --> 04:47.837
They're inviting dead
people to come home with them

04:47.839 --> 04:49.898
and trapping them.

04:50.642 --> 04:53.712
Either someone in this house now
or someone who used to live here

04:53.714 --> 04:55.880
is messing around with dark magic

04:55.882 --> 04:59.583
and is calling out to the
dead, but I don't know why.

04:59.585 --> 05:01.216
I really [bleep] hope

05:01.218 --> 05:03.318
these people are not here anymore.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.288
I'm angry right now.

05:05.290 --> 05:09.293
I really, really [bleep]
hope they don't live here.

05:12.265 --> 05:14.097
What else is going on?

05:14.099 --> 05:15.563
Mood swings.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.363
What kind of mood swings?
What are you talking about?

05:17.365 --> 05:21.930
I could be one moment cooking
and being happy and laughing,

05:21.932 --> 05:25.499
and then all of sudden, I
just get into being angry.

05:25.501 --> 05:27.300
I'm just so mad,

05:27.302 --> 05:31.265
and I get very abusive to my husband.

05:31.267 --> 05:33.635
I really have to, like, leave the house.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.171
When you leave the house,
are your moods better?

05:36.173 --> 05:37.671
Perfect. I'm happy.

05:37.673 --> 05:40.005
You on any medication
that would cause this?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.453
No.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.412
It got real bad where my relationship

05:45.414 --> 05:49.562
with my husband is really going down.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.684
We were like love birds.

05:51.686 --> 05:53.954
We were together for 13 years,

05:53.956 --> 05:57.154
and it's like now, there's
times that I don't want

05:57.156 --> 05:58.924
nothing to do with my husband at all.

06:01.693 --> 06:03.159
Sorry.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.765
It's gotta be tough for
him too, I would think.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.364
It's real tough, and he doesn't walk away,

06:10.366 --> 06:14.568
'cause he knows it's this house
that's making me act like this.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.034
This is not me.

06:19.173 --> 06:26.977
There's also really intense and big energy.

06:26.979 --> 06:30.447
I'm thinking it's some type of poltergeist.

06:33.284 --> 06:37.352
This person is not mentally well.

06:40.287 --> 06:43.199
I think it's the person
practicing dark [bleep].

06:44.527 --> 06:48.729
I would think that people who were here

06:48.731 --> 06:53.165
would feel this panic.

06:55.435 --> 06:59.168
It's really fear, but you feel it like...

07:00.717 --> 07:02.733
anxiety.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.309
I'm, like, literally shaking.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.617
So, what's going on in here?

07:14.619 --> 07:16.052
We all sleep together here.

07:16.054 --> 07:19.789
My son, the babies, stays
in this room with us,

07:19.791 --> 07:23.193
because they're too scared to
be in the rest of the house.

07:23.195 --> 07:27.564
I actually had my son that
was lifted off the floor.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.501
He was in the air.

07:30.503 --> 07:34.103
I seen my son in the air
by the back of his shirt.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.474
What happened?

07:36.476 --> 07:39.779
My husband got off the
bed and he fell completely.

07:39.781 --> 07:41.248
So, whatever had him let go?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.752
Yes, and he was scared.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.088
We were all scared.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.665
And what about you? Anything with you?

07:46.690 --> 07:53.362
Yeah. I wake up with bruises
on my legs like I've been hit.

07:53.364 --> 07:54.962
Just on your legs?

07:54.964 --> 07:56.797
Yes, just on my legs.

07:56.799 --> 07:59.033
This is just something small.

08:00.636 --> 08:03.638
This is when the bruises
are already just going away.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.174
Yeah, but you said the
kids sleep in bed with you.

08:06.176 --> 08:07.550
Sure you ain't getting kicked by the kids?

08:07.575 --> 08:10.546
No, no, no, no. I'm a light sleeper.

08:17.989 --> 08:19.692
What happened?

08:19.694 --> 08:21.596
I just keep getting touched on.

08:21.598 --> 08:24.366
So, you're getting touched right now?

08:24.368 --> 08:25.835
Yes, while I'm talking to you.

08:25.837 --> 08:27.004
Every time I keep telling you

08:27.006 --> 08:29.173
about something that has happened in here,

08:29.175 --> 08:31.988
somebody keeps tapping me on my back.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.544
I'm getting mad.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.513
I'm starting to get upset about this now.

08:41.885 --> 08:43.217
Wow.

08:43.220 --> 08:47.391
This poltergeist has some juice.

08:47.393 --> 08:50.059
Person's praying. I see
the back of her head.

08:50.061 --> 08:51.827
She's got her hair pinned
kind of like mine...

08:51.829 --> 08:54.132
pinned up, brown.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.467
She gets smacked by the poltergeist.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.658
Smack.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.006
What all can this poltergeist do?

09:01.008 --> 09:05.840
Slapping, hitting, pushing,
shoving, holding people down.

09:05.842 --> 09:08.642
I see her again, beat up by this energy.

09:08.644 --> 09:10.643
Someone's feeding it, for sure.

09:12.546 --> 09:14.348
Getting scared now.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.584
Let's go outside.

09:17.746 --> 09:19.321
Just had to get out of there. I'm sorry.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.990
No, no, listen, I'm gonna try my hardest

09:20.992 --> 09:22.492
to figure out what the hell's here.

09:22.494 --> 09:25.362
That's one thing about me...
I'm real hard on the inside

09:25.364 --> 09:31.667
and the outside, but
this, it makes you weak.

10:01.459 --> 10:04.168
So, Travas, this is your son's room?

10:04.241 --> 10:06.174
This is Travas and DeSean's room,

10:06.176 --> 10:08.343
but they won't sleep in here.

10:08.345 --> 10:10.045
They're too scared to sleep in here.

10:10.047 --> 10:11.745
That's sad, actually.

10:11.747 --> 10:13.479
Now, I was talking to your wife,

10:13.481 --> 10:16.348
and, I tell you, the
stuff she was telling me

10:16.350 --> 10:19.386
that's been going on
here is really concerning.

10:19.388 --> 10:23.695
Everything was good, but
moved into this house,

10:23.697 --> 10:27.330
and all of a sudden, like,
everything just went chaos.

10:27.332 --> 10:29.130
She's, like, a totally different person,

10:29.132 --> 10:31.668
like, anger... like, straight mad, angry.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.616
And she wasn't like that before?

10:33.641 --> 10:35.106
No, never like that.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.874
Never.

10:36.876 --> 10:38.541
We almost got a divorce.

10:38.543 --> 10:39.711
Geez.

10:39.713 --> 10:41.547
Now, what makes you
think this is paranormal?

10:41.549 --> 10:42.915
It's got to be.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.282
We had a perfect marriage for so long

10:45.284 --> 10:47.385
till we moved here.

10:47.387 --> 10:49.822
Tell me about some of the experiences.

10:49.824 --> 10:52.490
If I am watching TV and
I'm sitting on the bed,

10:52.492 --> 10:55.161
I've seen, like, a shadow
right there by my door.

10:55.163 --> 10:57.531
As soon as I turn, you
see the shadow just leave.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.965
- What kind of shadow? What's it look like?
- A dark shadow.

10:59.967 --> 11:01.299
Okay, what, does it
stay there? Is it quick?

11:01.301 --> 11:02.633
- What's the story?
- Nah, it's quick.

11:02.635 --> 11:04.941
When you get ready to, like,
look that way, all of a sudden,

11:04.966 --> 11:06.236
it goes down the hall.

11:07.005 --> 11:08.012
Okay.

11:08.037 --> 11:09.372
When I was talking to your wife,

11:09.374 --> 11:10.739
she was talking about
all the physical things

11:10.741 --> 11:12.477
that are happening to her
and how things have changed.

11:12.479 --> 11:15.116
She wakes up with bruises and
everything. What about you?

11:15.118 --> 11:16.719
I don't have bruises,

11:16.721 --> 11:20.220
but, one day, I was dozing off in my bed,

11:20.222 --> 11:23.056
and I woke up, but I'm,
like, stuck... can't move.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.826
My eyes open, but I
can't say nothing or move.

11:25.828 --> 11:28.062
Wow. So, what'd you do?

11:28.064 --> 11:29.463
I couldn't do nothing.

11:29.465 --> 11:31.999
There's nothing I could've
did until I popped out of it.

11:32.001 --> 11:35.936
It let me go, and then I wake up...

11:35.938 --> 11:39.274
neck pains, like, before I
go to work in the morning.

11:39.276 --> 11:41.106
My back be hurting.

11:41.108 --> 11:44.007
I never been through this. I
never experienced this before.

11:44.009 --> 11:45.544
How are living like that?

11:45.546 --> 11:48.311
It's hard, man. It's hard.

11:56.255 --> 11:59.690
There's this weird, dark thing.

11:59.692 --> 12:01.692
It's [bleep] weird looking.

12:04.630 --> 12:08.936
It's about this big... like that.

12:08.938 --> 12:12.471
And it's like shades of black and gray.

12:14.506 --> 12:17.276
He moves around here a lot.

12:20.146 --> 12:26.786
In this hallway, he's focused on this male.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.986
What do you mean?

12:27.988 --> 12:30.421
He drains his energy.

12:30.423 --> 12:34.227
He possesses him, so
he jumps into his body.

12:34.229 --> 12:36.498
This dark shadow creature

12:36.500 --> 12:39.601
has destructive ways of
interacting with living people,

12:39.603 --> 12:43.208
and I see that it's
targeting a man in this house.

12:43.210 --> 12:45.142
It pretty much tortures him

12:45.144 --> 12:49.816
and makes him feel
trapped inside of himself.

12:49.818 --> 12:55.655
And when he does that,
he causes extreme pain.

12:55.657 --> 12:57.888
Do you know what it wants from him?

12:57.890 --> 12:59.758
Death.

13:00.824 --> 13:03.825
Yeah, this thing is not good.

13:12.061 --> 13:13.996
Sweetheart, how old are you?

13:13.998 --> 13:15.798
- I'm 13.
- 13.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.968
Okay, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

13:17.970 --> 13:20.001
What have you experienced?

13:20.003 --> 13:22.773
I see shadows.

13:22.775 --> 13:26.078
It moves real quick,
and it's black and tall.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.680
Where exactly do you see it?

13:27.682 --> 13:29.549
Sometimes, I will be laying in my bed,

13:29.551 --> 13:32.751
and I'll just see it go
right past the hallway.

13:32.753 --> 13:34.819
- Can you see through it?
- No.

13:34.821 --> 13:35.952
Okay.

13:35.954 --> 13:37.485
There anything else?

13:37.487 --> 13:38.585
Voices...

13:38.587 --> 13:41.355
Just hear a lot of people talking at once.

13:41.357 --> 13:43.291
Okay, does it sound like
they're talking to each other

13:43.293 --> 13:45.124
or they're trying to talk to you?

13:45.126 --> 13:47.758
I can't say because
they're all talking at once,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.626
so I can't hear what they're saying.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.763
Okay. How are you sleeping at night?

13:52.765 --> 13:55.245
I got to force myself to go to sleep.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.850
I put my headphones in and listen to music.

13:59.241 --> 14:01.409
Okay, and you keep that on all night?

14:01.411 --> 14:03.166
Mm-hmm.

14:03.514 --> 14:05.357
Okay, are you afraid right now?

14:06.117 --> 14:08.650
You seem a little, you
know, like, a little tense.

14:08.652 --> 14:11.288
They don't want me here.

14:11.290 --> 14:12.520
Okay.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.334
There are people outside,

14:27.336 --> 14:29.736
and I did see people down the block

14:29.738 --> 14:32.059
that were, kind of, walking up...

14:34.187 --> 14:36.309
Mostly men.

14:37.337 --> 14:42.695
And they are out of it.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.188
It looks like, you
know, a bunch of zombies.

14:46.190 --> 14:48.891
How many?

14:48.893 --> 14:53.062
A lot... about 20, 25.

14:58.984 --> 15:01.922
I do hear them.

15:04.140 --> 15:08.777
I think this person hears
them talking outside...

15:08.779 --> 15:10.578
mumble, mumble, mumble.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.978
This bothers this person a great deal.

15:16.952 --> 15:20.953
This person is really good

15:20.955 --> 15:26.659
at pushing things out and blocking things,

15:26.661 --> 15:31.432
but there's still this overwhelming fear.

15:31.434 --> 15:34.135
They need to just get the [bleep] out.

15:49.544 --> 15:52.744
I know Hurricane Andrew
devastated southern Florida.

15:52.746 --> 15:54.379
In fact, back in '92 when it happened,

15:54.381 --> 15:57.483
I came down here to
help in a rescue effort.

15:57.485 --> 15:59.352
I reached out to a local newspaper reporter

15:59.354 --> 16:02.223
to see if Travas and Tracy's
property was affected.

16:02.225 --> 16:04.527
He said I should come meet with him.

16:10.068 --> 16:13.171
Well, Ken, thanks for
meeting me. I appreciate that.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.841
So, I know my clients'
home was built in 2004,

16:15.843 --> 16:19.111
but what was there back in
'92 before the hurricane hit?

16:19.113 --> 16:20.645
It was a mobile home park.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.779
Okay.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.813
Here is an aerial photo

16:23.815 --> 16:26.584
that shows just how bad the damage was.

16:27.522 --> 16:29.355
It was like a war zone.

16:29.357 --> 16:30.457
Wow.

16:30.459 --> 16:33.627
I just drove past this water tank here,

16:33.629 --> 16:35.797
so this is real close
to my clients' property.

16:35.799 --> 16:37.969
So, what was it like when the storm hit?

16:37.971 --> 16:40.536
It was extremely intense...

16:40.538 --> 16:43.537
Gusts of more than 200 miles per hour.

16:43.539 --> 16:47.444
It was one of Florida's worst disasters.

16:47.446 --> 16:51.116
It mangled cars, planes, boats.

16:51.118 --> 16:53.988
At the time, it was the costliest hurricane

16:53.990 --> 16:59.626
to hit the United States... $26.5 billion.

16:59.628 --> 17:03.462
It virtually changed the face of Florida.

17:03.464 --> 17:04.996
How many people actually died in Florida?

17:04.998 --> 17:07.934
Andrew killed a total
of 44 people in Florida.

17:07.935 --> 17:10.605
- Okay.
- And that included 26 people

17:10.607 --> 17:13.239
directly as a result of the storm.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.941
How did they die?

17:14.943 --> 17:18.078
People were hit by tree limbs.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.214
They drove their cars into high water.

17:21.215 --> 17:25.888
One man actually got crushed
in his home by the high winds.

17:28.224 --> 17:30.329
It was like a squadron of heavy bombers

17:30.331 --> 17:33.302
flew overhead and just unloaded.

17:33.304 --> 17:34.569
Right.

17:43.011 --> 17:46.854
I don't get what the [bleep]
these zombies are doing.

17:47.884 --> 17:50.084
Some of them look like
they've been eaten...

17:50.086 --> 17:54.322
Like, legs are missing, and they're a mess.

17:57.291 --> 18:01.659
They drowned, I think.

18:01.661 --> 18:06.431
I know that, you know, they
pretty much died together

18:06.433 --> 18:11.002
and somehow, they know enough to seek help,

18:11.004 --> 18:14.308
or they're drawn to the energy here.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.542
Very bizarre.

18:18.577 --> 18:20.984
I reached out to the current
owner of Tracy's property

18:20.986 --> 18:24.284
and some of the former tenants,
but nobody would talk to me.

18:24.286 --> 18:26.118
So, since I was striking
out with the living,

18:26.120 --> 18:28.552
I started looking into the dead.

18:28.554 --> 18:31.053
After making a few calls, I got
in touch with a local professor

18:31.055 --> 18:33.888
who tells me one of the
original owners of the land

18:33.890 --> 18:35.724
ended up getting destroyed by it.

18:43.431 --> 18:46.101
So, Dr. George, if I'm
standing on my clients' property

18:46.103 --> 18:48.004
back in 1910, what would've been there?

18:48.006 --> 18:49.372
It was a wilderness...

18:49.374 --> 18:51.773
Flooded heavily during the
rainy season in the summer,

18:51.775 --> 18:53.844
mosquitoes galore at all times.

18:53.846 --> 18:56.551
It was the most desolate place imaginable.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.711
I mean, who owned the land originally?

18:58.736 --> 18:59.902
Well, the land down there,

18:59.927 --> 19:01.328
it was owned by the Tatum brothers...

19:01.353 --> 19:03.522
Four brothers who were big-time developers

19:03.547 --> 19:04.613
in the Miami area.

19:04.638 --> 19:08.160
- Okay.
- Men of means, men of standing.

19:08.162 --> 19:11.131
In fact, here's a
photograph of one of them.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.399
This is Smiley Tatum.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.365
Heavily educated, he was
educated in the subject area

19:15.367 --> 19:16.733
of chemistry of all things.

19:16.735 --> 19:20.105
Here's his wife Florie. You
can see she's high society.

19:20.107 --> 19:22.208
Very well educated, too.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.277
So, now the Tatums that
bought all this land,

19:24.279 --> 19:25.411
did they live on it?

19:25.413 --> 19:26.612
No, not at all.

19:26.614 --> 19:29.051
They lived in the more
settled areas of Miami

19:29.053 --> 19:31.055
in beautiful homes.

19:31.057 --> 19:33.989
You get a sense of the wealth they had.

19:33.991 --> 19:35.857
These are like small mansions.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.628
So, what the hell were
they trying to develop?

19:39.630 --> 19:41.896
Well, the Tatum brothers
wanted to sell land,

19:41.898 --> 19:44.467
and they needed to get
people to buy that land,

19:44.469 --> 19:46.735
and so they sent some of
their people on their payroll

19:46.737 --> 19:49.069
up to Detroit, hoping to get...

19:49.071 --> 19:52.042
Actually hoping to create
a colony of physicians

19:52.044 --> 19:55.045
who would move from Detroit
to this desolate place.

19:55.047 --> 19:57.379
And they sold them this land sight unseen,

19:57.381 --> 19:59.082
because their salespeople

19:59.084 --> 20:02.085
are just so wild in the
way they describe the place,

20:02.087 --> 20:03.450
"This is the Garden of Eden."

20:03.452 --> 20:04.751
Okay, so let me get this straight.

20:04.753 --> 20:06.219
When they came down here,
they thought they were gonna be

20:06.221 --> 20:08.554
moving into, like, a place
that had infrastructure already?

20:08.556 --> 20:09.887
Yeah, infrastructure and, you know,

20:09.889 --> 20:11.087
more as a planned community,

20:11.089 --> 20:13.456
but that's not what
the Tatums had for them.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.658
Okay, now, on the phone,

20:14.660 --> 20:16.261
you mentioned the land
destroyed the Tatums.

20:16.263 --> 20:17.394
What did you mean?

20:17.396 --> 20:19.896
They prospered for the
next decade and a half.

20:19.898 --> 20:21.600
Through the first half of the 1920s,

20:21.602 --> 20:22.903
there's a huge land boom.

20:22.905 --> 20:25.337
And then the boom collapses in '26,

20:25.339 --> 20:28.008
and they lose almost everything.

20:28.010 --> 20:29.044
Wow.

20:29.046 --> 20:30.346
She lost it all too.

20:30.348 --> 20:32.815
When they lost everything by
the second half of the 1920s,

20:32.817 --> 20:34.717
Florie becomes just a regular person,

20:34.719 --> 20:35.784
and they're hurting.

20:35.786 --> 20:37.285
They're straining to get by.

20:41.194 --> 20:46.098
There's an elderly woman,
this kind of creepy chick.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.603
Like, what I'm seeing,
like, a lot of animals,

20:48.605 --> 20:52.838
like snakes and there were fish.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.110
Like, I'm seeing a lot of wilderness.

20:56.112 --> 20:59.247
Even the land looked wild.

21:03.586 --> 21:06.787
But it belongs to her
so I'm a little confused

21:06.789 --> 21:10.521
as to where the [bleep]
this woman's house was.

21:10.523 --> 21:12.022
I don't know if she had four houses,

21:12.024 --> 21:15.060
or she's, like, putting
it on four houses here.

21:17.097 --> 21:23.936
So, this is where the old
lady likes to chill about.

21:27.107 --> 21:29.609
Extremely wealthy, powerful woman.

21:32.644 --> 21:34.044
She is physical,

21:34.046 --> 21:38.046
and she is attached to...

21:38.048 --> 21:43.881
a female in the house.

21:57.843 --> 21:59.577
So far, I know my clients' property

21:59.579 --> 22:01.715
was owned by greedy land developers

22:01.717 --> 22:05.086
and then devastated by Hurricane Andrew,

22:05.088 --> 22:07.087
but I need to see if there's anything else.

22:08.857 --> 22:10.225
Searching through the archives,

22:10.227 --> 22:12.661
I discover a deadly shootout
on Travas and Tracy's land

22:12.663 --> 22:15.630
between cops and four bank robbers.

22:15.632 --> 22:17.398
This property's really
turning out to be a magnet

22:17.400 --> 22:19.333
for pain and suffering.

22:19.335 --> 22:22.335
I've placed a call to a local police chief

22:22.337 --> 22:25.237
who says what happened will
definitely help my case.

22:33.044 --> 22:35.081
During my research,

22:35.083 --> 22:36.783
I came across an article about a shootout

22:36.785 --> 22:39.686
between the cops and some bank robbers

22:39.688 --> 22:41.454
that actually started in your jurisdiction.

22:41.456 --> 22:42.891
What can you tell me about it?

22:42.893 --> 22:45.561
On September 15, 1916,

22:45.563 --> 22:47.662
these crooks by the name of the Rice Gang

22:47.664 --> 22:49.598
did a bank robbery here in Homestead,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.202
and they jumped into a stolen car,

22:51.204 --> 22:52.870
and they headed to the Everglades

22:52.872 --> 22:54.404
near your clients' property.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.738
What happens next?

22:55.740 --> 22:58.209
A posse was formed by Sheriff Dan Hardie,

22:58.211 --> 23:00.814
and the next night, they went
down looking for these guys.

23:00.816 --> 23:01.983
Okay, so now what happens?

23:01.985 --> 23:03.720
I understand there was a shootout, though.

23:03.722 --> 23:05.585
Yes, they opened fire on three deputies,

23:05.587 --> 23:07.686
and three deputies were killed.

23:07.688 --> 23:09.654
Do we know anything about who they were?

23:09.656 --> 23:12.946
One of the cops that was
killed was Allen Henderson.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.092
He gets shot nine times in the back.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.892
What about the other guy?

23:17.894 --> 23:21.329
Well, the second guy
who was shot was brother.

23:21.331 --> 23:22.965
- His brother?
- His brother, William Henderson.

23:22.967 --> 23:25.500
He was shot once in the leg.

23:25.502 --> 23:27.166
Both of them died at the scene.

23:27.168 --> 23:28.268
Who was the third cop?

23:28.270 --> 23:29.904
The third cop was Charles Williams.

23:29.906 --> 23:31.939
He was shot five times, as well,

23:31.941 --> 23:34.305
and he died the next day.

23:34.307 --> 23:35.639
The shootout happens.

23:35.641 --> 23:37.009
Do these guys at least get shot

23:37.011 --> 23:38.745
at the scene, the perps, or do they flee?

23:38.747 --> 23:41.213
- What happens?
- They flee into the Everglades.

23:41.215 --> 23:43.146
They were there for
approximately two weeks.

23:43.148 --> 23:45.749
Eventually, two of the
subjects were killed.

23:45.751 --> 23:47.051
Okay, so how does that happen?

23:47.053 --> 23:49.386
One of them was killed by
civilians stealing supplies.

23:49.388 --> 23:50.852
Another one of the guys drowned.

23:50.854 --> 23:52.287
So, what happens with the other two guys?

23:52.289 --> 23:54.223
Well, Frank Rice and Hugh Alderman,

23:54.225 --> 23:55.425
they were apprehended

23:55.427 --> 23:57.129
and charged with first degree murder.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.097
Matter of fact, I have a article here

23:59.099 --> 24:00.664
from the local newspaper.

24:02.267 --> 24:03.468
Did they go to trial?

24:03.470 --> 24:05.540
Yes, they did, and when they went to trial,

24:05.542 --> 24:07.512
they were convicted of
second degree murder.

24:07.514 --> 24:10.180
As a matter of fact, one of the guys, Rice,

24:10.182 --> 24:12.985
he was paroled after nine years.

24:12.987 --> 24:14.354
The other guy, Alderman,

24:14.356 --> 24:17.393
went insane while he was in prison

24:17.509 --> 24:20.040
and eventually transferred
to Florida State Hospital

24:20.065 --> 24:23.102
where he spent the next
53 years until he died.

24:29.906 --> 24:33.375
Everybody sees him in this hall.

24:33.377 --> 24:34.741
Sees who?

24:34.743 --> 24:37.212
He's the dude who is

24:37.214 --> 24:41.388
possessing the other guy... the living one.

24:46.330 --> 24:48.196
I'm starting to catch quick glimpses

24:48.198 --> 24:51.131
of what this dark shadow
man was like in life,

24:51.133 --> 24:54.068
and I'm seeing that he was
a very disturbed person.

24:54.070 --> 24:56.237
He was captured.

24:56.239 --> 24:59.138
He was a prisoner.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.539
He was...

25:01.541 --> 25:04.906
murdered or executed.

25:04.908 --> 25:08.811
The living one, I think he went somewhere,

25:08.813 --> 25:12.980
and he brought this home.

25:19.089 --> 25:23.191
I feel like this guy entrapped him somehow.

25:23.193 --> 25:28.457
And so this dead guy
felt, "I was finally free,

25:28.459 --> 25:35.820
and you trapped me, so I'm gonna get ya."

25:46.632 --> 25:48.868
During my walk, I saw
a group of dead people

25:48.870 --> 25:51.771
gathered outside of a
young woman's bedroom.

25:51.773 --> 25:53.556
I'm meeting with the sketch artist

25:53.586 --> 25:55.903
to describe this horrifying scene.

25:56.074 --> 25:57.676
On the other side of the window,

25:57.678 --> 26:01.343
there were several dead men.

26:01.345 --> 26:04.341
Their clothes were all in tatters,

26:04.783 --> 26:07.552
and I saw a person on the bed.

26:07.554 --> 26:10.387
They had their hands on
their head, on their ears.

26:17.962 --> 26:19.430
Is this what you saw?

26:19.432 --> 26:21.267
Yes.

26:43.609 --> 26:46.343
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:46.345 --> 26:48.607
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:48.609 --> 26:51.065
and our clients for the first time.

26:51.845 --> 26:54.549
Amy, I'd like you to meet Travas and Tracy.

26:54.551 --> 26:55.716
Now, they're a married couple.

26:55.718 --> 26:57.460
They have three beautiful kids.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.723
They have been living
here for about a year.

27:00.725 --> 27:02.124
This is a photo.

27:03.392 --> 27:05.158
Basically, since they
moved here, their lives

27:05.160 --> 27:06.994
have been turned upside down.

27:06.996 --> 27:08.764
The kids are nothing but sad and scared.

27:08.766 --> 27:10.334
They want their happy life together.

27:10.336 --> 27:11.667
They had a great marriage.

27:11.669 --> 27:13.336
Now, they're talking about
possibly getting divorced

27:13.338 --> 27:15.438
because of all that's going on here.

27:15.440 --> 27:18.643
They wanna know what's here,
how to kick it the hell out,

27:18.645 --> 27:21.077
and get back to their normal lives.

27:21.079 --> 27:23.108
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

27:23.110 --> 27:24.941
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.148
As soon as I walked up to the door,

27:29.150 --> 27:32.250
there were a bunch of dead people

27:32.252 --> 27:34.918
on the inside of the house

27:34.920 --> 27:38.120
that were piling up on the door,

27:38.122 --> 27:39.522
wanting out.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.662
And when I came in,

27:42.664 --> 27:45.543
I saw a female

27:45.704 --> 27:49.475
who was a part of a couple that lived here

27:49.641 --> 27:52.576
who was messing around with magic,

27:52.578 --> 27:54.010
calling out to the dead,

27:54.012 --> 27:57.816
trapping and collecting these dead people,

27:57.818 --> 28:03.156
and what they left here
was this ridiculous energy.

28:03.158 --> 28:05.025
And honestly, I didn't
know if it was you guys

28:05.027 --> 28:06.861
or someone who lived here prior.

28:09.995 --> 28:13.323
But seeing you, it seemed
to be an older female.

28:14.413 --> 28:16.682
Well, when they got the
place, the woman that owns it

28:16.778 --> 28:18.345
was saging the place when they got here.

28:18.347 --> 28:19.582
Yes.

28:19.584 --> 28:21.685
Wow.

28:21.687 --> 28:25.786
Now, if she was saging,
then something was going on.

28:30.435 --> 28:33.574
The other thing that I saw

28:33.576 --> 28:36.543
pretty much as soon as I walked in

28:36.545 --> 28:39.313
was a poltergeist.

28:41.784 --> 28:45.187
A poltergeist is created by a living agent

28:45.189 --> 28:48.121
by the electrical charges that
they send out into the air.

28:48.123 --> 28:50.325
It's just a mass of energy.

28:50.327 --> 28:52.361
Now, I don't know if it was

28:52.363 --> 28:54.798
the previous family who created it,

28:54.800 --> 28:58.835
but anyone who's having
emotional issues can feed it.

29:01.103 --> 29:05.941
In the master bedroom,
I saw someone praying,

29:05.943 --> 29:10.012
and this thing smacked her upside the head.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.788
It's a pretty powerful thing.

29:16.790 --> 29:18.492
Well, one of the other
main reasons we're here

29:18.494 --> 29:22.195
is because Tracy's being attacked at night.

29:22.197 --> 29:23.765
Tell Amy about that.

29:23.767 --> 29:26.635
Well, when I wake up in the morning

29:26.637 --> 29:28.203
and I look down,

29:28.205 --> 29:31.541
my legs are just covered with bruises,

29:31.543 --> 29:35.674
like if somebody kicked me, beat me.

29:35.676 --> 29:37.975
Matter of fact, here's a photo.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.377
That's the bruises she would get.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.880
Oh, my gosh.

29:43.882 --> 29:46.748
Now, you also got held down in the bed.

29:46.750 --> 29:47.982
Yeah.

29:47.984 --> 29:50.684
I was dozing off, and all of a sudden,

29:50.686 --> 29:53.561
I just felt something
just, like, hold me down.

29:54.091 --> 29:56.722
I couldn't say anything. I couldn't move.

29:56.724 --> 29:59.727
I couldn't say anything, but eventually,

29:59.729 --> 30:01.394
It let me go.

30:03.028 --> 30:04.294
And it's not just you.

30:04.296 --> 30:07.198
I mean, you saw your son getting picked up.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.268
- Mm-hmm.
- Travas Jr. here.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.108
It was the middle of the night,

30:13.110 --> 30:15.512
and all of a sudden, I
heard him, like, gagging,

30:15.514 --> 30:18.914
like something had him
by the back of his shirt.

30:18.916 --> 30:20.718
We got up, and...

30:20.720 --> 30:23.218
And he just fell, just...

30:23.220 --> 30:24.517
Wow.

30:30.159 --> 30:31.793
What else did you get?

30:31.795 --> 30:34.696
So, there's this older lady that I met.

30:34.698 --> 30:38.867
Whoever she can scare the
most is where she'll go,

30:41.149 --> 30:46.417
and she is attaching herself
to a female in the house.

30:49.836 --> 30:53.237
You know, making this
female feel out of control,

30:53.536 --> 30:58.638
making her feel anxiety,
causing outbursts of rage.

31:04.497 --> 31:06.221
Well, since they moved here,

31:06.223 --> 31:08.822
Tracy's personality has done a 180.

31:08.824 --> 31:14.494
I just get to a point
where I dislike my husband.

31:14.496 --> 31:16.729
I just hate him.

31:16.731 --> 31:19.068
I want to hurt him.

31:23.775 --> 31:27.011
There's just times that I just
don't even wanna be with him.

31:32.655 --> 31:36.189
They bad, bad mood swings.

31:38.801 --> 31:40.466
And I know this is not me.

31:44.667 --> 31:47.571
She wasn't never like this, never.

31:48.962 --> 31:50.706
Till we got here.

31:52.172 --> 31:53.809
Now, the woman you're talking about,

31:53.811 --> 31:55.743
did you get anything else on her?

31:55.745 --> 31:58.714
Well, one of the reasons
why this woman's here is

31:58.716 --> 32:03.122
because she believes this land is all hers.

32:03.618 --> 32:07.352
She was, like, very well
educated, very wealthy,

32:07.354 --> 32:11.253
and she owned a lot of land,

32:11.255 --> 32:15.489
but what I saw was just all, like, wild.

32:15.491 --> 32:19.258
But it was weird because I saw her,

32:19.260 --> 32:21.257
like, in four houses,

32:21.259 --> 32:26.427
so I'm a little confused as to
where this woman's house was.

32:26.429 --> 32:27.995
There's only one woman
that fits that description

32:27.997 --> 32:31.031
that actually owned big
chunk of the land here.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.869
Her name was Florie Tatum.

32:33.871 --> 32:35.239
Her and her husband Smiley,

32:35.241 --> 32:37.273
who were very wealthy, very powerful...

32:37.275 --> 32:39.108
You mentioned they owned
a lot of houses, right?

32:39.110 --> 32:41.444
She actually owned four homes in Miami.

32:41.446 --> 32:43.214
Wow.

32:43.216 --> 32:44.383
So, they lived large.

32:48.954 --> 32:53.525
Now, they bought up about
26,000 acres in this area,

32:53.527 --> 32:56.093
and this was nothing
but wilderness back then,

32:56.095 --> 33:00.562
but their plan was to make a
big profit developing the land.

33:00.564 --> 33:02.465
So, they set out to get people from north

33:02.467 --> 33:04.870
to get out of cold weather in Michigan,

33:04.872 --> 33:07.871
that, "You're gonna come live
in paradise, beautiful paradise."

33:07.873 --> 33:10.872
When they got here, it was a swamp.

33:10.874 --> 33:12.842
What goes around comes around.

33:12.844 --> 33:17.046
In 1926, the real estate
market here crashed.

33:17.048 --> 33:18.981
Florie wound up losing everything...

33:18.983 --> 33:22.386
her money, her standing,
her whole way of living.

33:22.388 --> 33:26.426
Now, do you think that might
have been the woman you saw?

33:26.428 --> 33:28.997
Yes.

33:28.999 --> 33:31.704
So, this is the woman
that's attached to her?

33:31.706 --> 33:34.007
Oh, my gosh.

33:34.009 --> 33:35.643
I'm so mad at her.

33:41.752 --> 33:43.987
Did you see anything else?

33:43.989 --> 33:46.591
I saw this thing in the hallway,

33:46.593 --> 33:49.695
and it was like this black blob.

33:49.697 --> 33:51.229
This entity, I think,

33:51.231 --> 33:55.433
had initially attached
to a male in the home.

33:55.435 --> 33:58.734
I do think that people can see him.

33:58.736 --> 34:01.705
I got that he was alive at one point.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.841
He was either murdered or executed.

34:03.843 --> 34:06.311
He was captured. He was a prisoner.

34:06.313 --> 34:08.112
And I saw something about a firing squad.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.254
That was all that I got about him.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.116
Now, this is not so obvious for me,

34:12.118 --> 34:15.587
but I got one thing I
came up in my research,

34:15.589 --> 34:18.456
and it was a shootout between
cops and some bank robbers.

34:18.458 --> 34:20.694
It happened in September of 1916.

34:20.696 --> 34:21.829
The gang called the Rice Gang,

34:21.831 --> 34:23.496
it was two brothers and two other guys.

34:23.498 --> 34:25.898
What they did is rob a bank in Homestead,

34:25.900 --> 34:28.204
which is less than a
mile from your property.

34:28.206 --> 34:30.072
Then when they fled there in a stolen car,

34:30.074 --> 34:31.706
they wind up holding up by that water tank

34:31.708 --> 34:34.077
that's literally a quarter of a mile

34:34.079 --> 34:35.780
from your property here.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.581
Well, you said a firing squad.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.283
The only thing I can think of
is that the cops got ambushed.

34:40.284 --> 34:41.786
When they showed up,
these guys all came out

34:41.788 --> 34:43.623
and started shooting at the cops

34:43.625 --> 34:45.495
and three cops got killed.

34:45.496 --> 34:47.165
Two of the cops were brothers.

34:51.638 --> 34:54.041
Do you think it's anybody that
was involved in the shootout?

34:54.043 --> 34:55.678
No.

34:55.679 --> 34:56.712
And why not?

34:56.714 --> 34:59.848
Because it goes much further back.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.284
Okay, so this happened in 1916.

35:01.286 --> 35:03.144
You're talking how much further back?

35:03.185 --> 35:04.865
Like the 1700s.

35:04.890 --> 35:06.725
Oh, okay.

35:07.536 --> 35:10.036
I think the living couple
that was into dark magic

35:10.061 --> 35:11.195
brought him here.

35:11.331 --> 35:12.700
He was in a cemetery,

35:12.702 --> 35:16.203
and these people trapped
him, brought him here,

35:16.205 --> 35:19.725
and he's pissed because
he was finally free.

35:19.885 --> 35:23.653
And he's lashing out
'cause he feels trapped.

35:23.678 --> 35:26.681
I think the living person would
experience great deal of pain,

35:26.706 --> 35:27.973
especially in the neck.

35:30.431 --> 35:32.031
My neck hurting right now.

35:32.056 --> 35:34.025
My neck stay hurting.

35:37.059 --> 35:39.962
He learned how to
possess the person's body,

35:39.964 --> 35:42.044
so he knows how to jump people.

35:43.134 --> 35:45.033
And what does he want
to do with the living?

35:45.035 --> 35:46.733
What does he want to do to them?

35:46.735 --> 35:48.236
He wanted to kill him.

35:50.602 --> 35:53.204
Sounds like you guys called
us just when you needed to.

35:53.229 --> 35:54.896
I think so, too.

35:55.329 --> 35:56.763
Yeah.

36:00.117 --> 36:03.088
There's another thing going on here.

36:03.113 --> 36:07.651
Outside was this group of dead people

36:07.676 --> 36:09.944
wandering down the streets.

36:09.969 --> 36:12.874
There was about 20, 25 of them out there.

36:12.899 --> 36:15.433
To me, they looked like zombies.

36:15.458 --> 36:17.458
Some of them, like,
their legs were missing.

36:17.483 --> 36:20.522
Some of them looked half eaten.

36:20.547 --> 36:22.647
All of them died together,

36:22.672 --> 36:25.406
and I thought that they looked drowned.

36:27.577 --> 36:29.712
Do you have any idea
where you're actually at,

36:29.737 --> 36:31.236
like the area?

36:31.261 --> 36:33.094
- No.
- Okay.

36:33.119 --> 36:35.318
It was August 24, 1992.

36:35.343 --> 36:39.848
Hurricane Andrew devastated
Homestead and Florida City,

36:39.873 --> 36:41.472
which is where we are now.

36:41.497 --> 36:43.295
Take a look at what their neighborhood

36:43.320 --> 36:45.220
looked like after the storm hit.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.475
Wait, this is here?

36:49.500 --> 36:50.765
Yes.

36:50.790 --> 36:52.856
Wow.

36:52.881 --> 36:58.653
175-mile-per-hour winds
plus 200 mile per hour gusts.

36:58.678 --> 37:00.045
Now, you said about 25 people.

37:00.070 --> 37:01.235
Mm-hmm.

37:01.260 --> 37:05.195
In Florida, 26 died the
day of the hurricane.

37:05.220 --> 37:08.389
Another 18 died as a
result after the hurricane.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.765
This was like ground zero for where it hit.

37:10.767 --> 37:12.233
Wow.

37:12.235 --> 37:15.136
I just can't believe
they're all still here.

37:15.138 --> 37:18.106
That's very upsetting.

37:24.097 --> 37:28.365
I did do a sketch of them

37:28.390 --> 37:32.622
talking to someone in the
back bedroom over here.

37:50.214 --> 37:52.115
And that's what she does.

38:10.015 --> 38:13.685
I did do a sketch of them

38:13.687 --> 38:17.556
talking to someone in the
back bedroom over here.

38:37.173 --> 38:39.190
And that's what she does.

38:45.139 --> 38:47.905
So, this supposed to be Rosario?

38:47.907 --> 38:53.148
It's a female that I saw
with dark hair in her teens.

38:54.281 --> 38:57.316
This sketch explains a lot to
me about what she was saying.

38:57.318 --> 38:59.118
Broke my heart listening to her.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.723
That's why she wears
her earphones at night.

39:03.792 --> 39:04.892
They don't let her sleep,

39:04.894 --> 39:06.929
so she'd rather sleep during the day.

39:09.299 --> 39:11.334
You need to speak with her.

39:11.336 --> 39:14.342
She's scared, this kid.
She's really scared.

39:14.766 --> 39:16.267
I promise.

39:18.584 --> 39:20.086
It's scary.

39:20.088 --> 39:22.423
I was expecting y'all to tell me something,

39:22.425 --> 39:24.970
but not at this extreme.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.469
Well, Travas and Tracy,
now you know what's here

39:33.471 --> 39:34.737
and what's ripping your family apart,

39:34.739 --> 39:37.376
and the big question is can you stay here

39:37.378 --> 39:40.312
and eventually be a loving family again?

39:40.314 --> 39:43.248
For the answer to that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy,

39:43.250 --> 39:45.651
see if she can help you out.

39:48.724 --> 39:52.325
You have a lot of random dead people

39:52.327 --> 39:56.328
that were unfortunately
collected and trapped here.

39:56.330 --> 40:00.667
You have an elderly woman
who's attached herself to you.

40:00.669 --> 40:04.170
There's a dead male influencing
a lot of people in the house,

40:04.172 --> 40:06.842
and you also have a poltergeist.

40:06.883 --> 40:10.116
There's also the victims
from the hurricane.

40:10.816 --> 40:14.052
The first thing would be a curandera

40:14.054 --> 40:15.954
is going to be contacted.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.989
What the hell's a curandera?

40:17.991 --> 40:21.994
They're healers traditionally
found in Latin American culture.

40:21.996 --> 40:25.125
They will utilize various methods

40:25.127 --> 40:32.095
like burning candles,
burning incense, using stones.

40:32.097 --> 40:35.062
The first thing they're gonna
do is remove the attachments...

40:35.064 --> 40:37.896
the dead lady and any of the dead

40:37.898 --> 40:40.388
that would follow you anywhere.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.476
The second thing is they're going to move

40:43.501 --> 40:47.439
on all of the dead, including
the hurricane victims.

40:47.441 --> 40:49.207
- Ah, that's great.
- So, that's awesome.

40:49.209 --> 40:52.045
The third thing is they're
gonna clear the home

40:52.047 --> 40:55.946
of all the residual and
current emotional muck.

40:55.948 --> 40:58.849
So, it's a person that could
cover anything that's here.

40:58.851 --> 41:00.686
Pretty much.

41:00.688 --> 41:02.488
Okay, yeah.

41:02.490 --> 41:04.189
Got chills.

41:04.191 --> 41:05.692
I know this was a lot, though, tonight.

41:05.694 --> 41:07.094
You guys got hit with a...

41:07.096 --> 41:08.728
Wow, it's a lot, yeah.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.130
How soon after they come through here

41:10.132 --> 41:12.233
and do their thing will
they see the difference?

41:12.235 --> 41:13.800
- Oh, immediately.
- Yeah?

41:13.802 --> 41:15.533
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, that's what's up.

41:15.535 --> 41:16.902
Yeah.

41:16.904 --> 41:20.008
It feels like a lot has
come off of me, a lot,

41:20.010 --> 41:23.678
'cause I really thought I was going crazy.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.681
I thought I was going insane.

41:25.683 --> 41:28.615
Yeah, we was on our urge
of, like, splitting up.

41:28.617 --> 41:29.950
But it's just... at the end of the day,

41:29.952 --> 41:31.618
she's still my wife, you know.

41:34.657 --> 41:36.389
You're gonna take Amy's advice?

41:36.391 --> 41:37.824
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

41:37.826 --> 41:39.360
How 'bout you? You
feeling good about what...

41:39.362 --> 41:40.794
- Most definitely.
- Okay.

41:40.796 --> 41:42.261
You know I am.

41:42.263 --> 41:43.964
I was shaky earlier.

41:43.966 --> 41:46.766
I'm still a little shaky,
but at least I know.

41:46.768 --> 41:48.201
- You feel better, though.
- Yeah, exactly.

41:48.203 --> 41:49.569
I feel way better.

41:49.571 --> 41:52.071
That it's not the end.

41:52.073 --> 41:55.339
Tracy and Travas need to follow my advice

41:55.341 --> 41:56.906
if they wanna fix their relationship

41:56.908 --> 41:59.638
and get rid of the evil that's
tearing their family apart.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.240
I believe that once they find a curandero,

42:02.242 --> 42:05.076
they can begin healing
and lead a peaceful life.
