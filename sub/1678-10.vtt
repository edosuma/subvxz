<i>OLDER TED; Now, I remember</i>
<i>a lot of stories</i>

00:17.784 --> 00:19.547
<i>from back in the days</i>
<i>before I met your mother,</i>

00:19.652 --> 00:21.813
<i>But there's one story I don't remember,</i>

00:21.921 --> 00:25.550
<i>Uncle Marshall still refers to it</i>
<i>as the "pineapple incident,"</i>

00:25.658 --> 00:28.855
<i>The night started like any other,</i>
<i>We were downstairs at the bar,</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:30.327
Hey, it's on the house.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.795
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:31.898 --> 00:34.389
It's my own concoction.
I call it the Red Dragon.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.230
- ALL: Wow.
- Thanks, Carl.

00:36.336 --> 00:37.428
- Really sweet.
- Wow.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.266
- We're not really doing shots, are we?
- I hope not.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.703
- No, no, no.
- Not in a million years.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.968
These look kind of like blood.

00:43.076 --> 00:46.978
Okay, I know that you've all dismissed
this theory before.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.139
But is there any chance
that Carl is a vampire?

00:49.616 --> 00:50.776
- No.
- That's ludicrous.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.152
No, look, I am serious. Think about it.
He always wears black,

00:54.254 --> 00:56.586
we never see him in the daylight,
only after dark.

00:56.689 --> 01:02.184
Oh, my God. That does describe a vampire.
Or, you know, a bartender.

01:02.529 --> 01:03.928
(LAUGHING)

01:04.030 --> 01:06.931
- Well, I should go get dressed.
- Where you going, buddy, hot date?

01:07.033 --> 01:09.399
I'll say. She's going out with a billionaire.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.367
Lily, I told you not to call him that.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.166
Wait, you're really going out
with a billionaire?

01:13.273 --> 01:15.298
He's not a billionaire.
He's a hundred millionaire.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.239
Why do people always round up?

01:17.343 --> 01:20.938
- So, where's Thurston Howell taking you?
- A charity dinner.

01:21.047 --> 01:24.744
- Yeah, $2,000 a plate.
- $1,500! Stop rounding up.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.919
- And it's for Third World hunger.
- You gonna put out?

01:29.155 --> 01:31.680
What? There's only one reason
he's taking her to this dinner,

01:31.791 --> 01:35.249
and it's not so little Mu Tu
can get his malaria pills.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.163

01:40.033 --> 01:42.024

- See you.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.330
- You okay?
- Sure. Why?

01:47.440 --> 01:51.240
Oh, I don't know.
Girl of your dreams, dating a billionaire.

01:51.344 --> 01:54.074
Okay, first of all, hundred millionaire.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.245
And second,
she's not the girl of my dreams.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.578
We're just friends.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.585
Look, it would not be smart
if we got together.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.019

she's looking for...

02:11.364 --> 02:15.425
See that little hottie on the end?
She's short, but has an ample bosom.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.868
I love it. She's like half boob. Let's go.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.702
Yeah, and say what?
What's our big opening line?

02:21.808 --> 02:25.005
Oh, it's, "Daddy's home."

02:26.312 --> 02:27.643
- Daddy's home?
- Yeah.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.545
(LAUGHING) Okay, you want us
to go over there, right now,

02:30.650 --> 02:33.312
and say to those girls, Daddy's home?

02:33.419 --> 02:35.614
Really think about that, Barney.

02:37.056 --> 02:39.388
Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.050
Okay, think about this.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.961
Is there even a single item on the menu
that has garlic in it?

02:45.231 --> 02:46.664
There's garlic fries.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.532
Okay, well, I'll get back to you.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.163
Oh! Daddy's back.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.399
See, if you'd taken
a moment to think about that...

02:54.507 --> 02:59.308
Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this
seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.470

03:00.580 --> 03:02.810
That worked? I hate the world.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.646
Ted, your problem is
all you do is think, think, think.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.777
I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.548
- Doo-doo.
- Totally.

03:10.323 --> 03:13.588
So I think a lot.
I happen to have a very powerful brain.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.253
- It can't be helped.
- Oh, yes, it can.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.492
Interesting!

03:18.598 --> 03:21.123
Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.896
It's like the universe was saying,
"Hey, Barney, there's this dude,

03:24.003 --> 03:27.268
"he's pretty cool,
but it's your job to make him awesome."

03:27.373 --> 03:29.603
Your brain screws you up, Ted.
It gets in the way.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.371
It happened with Robin.
It happened with half boob.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.070
And it's gonna keep on happening,

03:34.180 --> 03:38.446
until you power down that bucket
of neuroses, inebriation style.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.318
So what? You want me to do a shot?

03:41.554 --> 03:44.352
Oh, no. I want you to do five shots.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.584
- Oh, more interesting.
- Whoa.

03:47.093 --> 03:51.894
- Barney, I think you've officially...
- No, don't think. Do!

03:51.998 --> 03:56.458
Ted, he's right. You over think.
Maybe you should over drink.

- Drink. Drink. Drink.

how stupid they're being?

and moronic, and drink, drink.

- Whose number is that?
- I don't know.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.607
Dude, call it.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.144
Oh, hold on.
I'm gonna make some popcorn.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.781
Okay, you can call now.
God, this is intense. I love it.

- Hi. Who is this?

<i>- You called me, Who's this?</i>
- It's Ted.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.131
It's Carl from the bar.

Barney, you've always taken care of me.
You are a gentleman and a scholar!

12:25.811 --> 12:28.541
Go into my stable
and take my finest stallion.

12:28.647 --> 12:31.115
He's yours. His name is Windjammer.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.312
Sleep it off, bro.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.290
I'm back, baby doll!

12:40.526 --> 12:44.018
And I am gonna throw up.

12:46.165 --> 12:49.225
I threw up? My streak is over.

Sorry, Carl, go on.

12:55.641 --> 12:56.699
Carl?

12:57.343 --> 13:01.177
Did you know the word "karaoke"
is Japanese for empty orchestra?

13:01.814 --> 13:04.146
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?

13:05.084 --> 13:06.745
Are you a vampire?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.714
All right. I'm cutting you off.
Go home and get some sleep, Ted.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.087
Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.184
Wouldn't want to be around for that,
would we?

13:17.129 --> 13:19.393
Hey, how easy you think it would be
to sneak into the zoo?

13:19.498 --> 13:21.864
I have to see some penguins,
like, right now.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.731
- All right, give me your arm.
- Okay.

13:25.371 --> 13:28.169
This way, if you pass out in the gutter...

13:28.674 --> 13:30.005

13:30.643 --> 13:34.135
...someone will call me,

13:34.246 --> 13:35.736
Thanks, Carl.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.043
We can't just be friends!
We're attracted to each other.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.277
- We both know it.
- Excuse me?

13:41.120 --> 13:44.988
Me and Robin. Me and Robin.
I have to make one more call.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.622
Yeah, this'll go good.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.393
Hey, it's me again.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.762
Look. Who are we kidding?
You and I are both attracted to each other.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.703
We're young. We're drunk.
Half of us, anyway.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.273
And we only get one life.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.740
So, why don't you come over
to my apartment right now,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.574
and we'll think of something stupid
to do together.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.671
Really? Great.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.216
Wait, really? Great.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.618
Thanks, Carl.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.416
It's Robin. That's Robin in there.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.116
Did you guys...

14:27.533 --> 14:29.763
Oh, come on.
You've gotta give me this one.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.838
Those five shots got you farther
with Robin than your brain ever did.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.600
See what happens when you don't think?
You do!

14:35.708 --> 14:39.906
More importantly, you do Robin. Come on!

14:42.181 --> 14:44.274
All right, right over here.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.084
But, still, what does this mean?
Are we dating now?

14:48.187 --> 14:50.018
I mean,
I never pictured it going down this way,

14:50.122 --> 14:52.590
but maybe that's how it had to happen.
I mean, think about it.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.353
Someone get him a shot.
He's thinking again.

14:55.461 --> 14:59.158
Well, hold on, man. Maybe it's not
such a bad idea to think about this one.

14:59.265 --> 15:03.099
You and Robin went down this road
before. You got dinged up, really bad.

15:03.202 --> 15:06.660
You know who might have something
to say about Ted's future with Robin?

15:06.772 --> 15:08.967
Robin. Go wake her up.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.142
- Wake her up and say what?
- Daddy's home.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.476
Good luck, buddy.

- Ted, it's Robin.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.032
Are you sure?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.999
Hey, Robin. How are you?

15:43.108 --> 15:44.439
Ted, I think you and I should have a talk...

15:44.576 --> 15:46.203
- Is that Robin?
- So, who's the girl in the bedroom?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.212
...about those phone calls last night.
- I have no idea!

15:48.314 --> 15:50.214
- Do you mind if I swing by?
- Ask her about the pineapple!

15:50.316 --> 15:51.613
- Yeah, sure. Come on over.
- Thanks.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.378
No! Wait! Don't come.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.714
She's coming over. Crap!

15:55.821 --> 15:59.689
Wait, this is killing me.
We have to find out who that girl is.

16:00.559 --> 16:04.552
Trudy. My name is Trudy.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.595
<i>OLDER TED; And then Trudy filled us in,</i>

16:11.370 --> 16:13.429
I'm just surprised
you didn't dump him sooner.

16:13.539 --> 16:17.031
I know. It's two years of my life
I'm never getting back.

16:17.142 --> 16:21.476
A little part of me wants to
just jump the bones of the next guy I see.

16:22.514 --> 16:23.947
Daddy's home.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.548
Or the one after that.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.181
Okay, fair enough.
But I've got to prove a point to a friend.

16:29.288 --> 16:34.453
So, you just gave me your number,
and your name is Amy.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.454

Look at that idiot go.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.392
He's kind of cute.

What are you doing in the men's room?

16:54.747 --> 16:57.238
What am I doing in the ladies' room?

16:57.349 --> 17:00.443
Oh, right, I came in here
'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.

17:00.552 --> 17:01.746
Did you?

17:03.288 --> 17:04.653
I did not.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.290
And the streak continues.
Vomit-free since '93.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.891
Sorry, Trudy. Go on.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.093
I liked your performance.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.895
What, the karaoke?

17:17.269 --> 17:19.031

17:19.438 --> 17:20.905

Getting up
and making a complete idiot of myself.

17:23.909 --> 17:26.173
- So do it.
- I don't know.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.641
Still, I've had a pretty serious week.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.114
I could sure stand to do something stupid.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.310
I'm something stupid. Do me.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.579
(LAUGHING) You're funny.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.418
- Hey, can I call you sometime?
- Okay.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.159
Here, let me.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.355
Why do they call it "karaoke," anyhow?

17:46.465 --> 17:49.366
Was it invented by a woman
named Carrie Okie?

17:49.635 --> 17:52.160
These are the kinds of things I think about.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.934
"Karaoke" is Japanese
for empty orchestra.

17:56.608 --> 18:00.100
Wow. That's hauntingly beautiful.

Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.085
Why? Is that your girlfriend?

18:46.191 --> 18:48.887
No. That's not my girlfriend.
Look, it's complicated.

You're married.
Yeah, I can't believe I did this.

No, no, no. I'm not married.
I'll explain after you hide.

Hey, Robin. Good sweater.

19:07.846 --> 19:11.077
Sorry I kept calling you like that.
I was pretty drunk.

19:11.183 --> 19:14.243
Yeah, no kidding.
Those calls were really weird.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.219
Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.083
- Let's go get a snack.
- I love to snack.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.454
I'm good.
