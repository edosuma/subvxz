00:02.536 --> 00:04.436
(mysterious music)

00:45.846 --> 00:47.312
(tense music)

00:51.285 --> 00:52.717
(horse grunts, snorts)

00:59.760 --> 01:02.961
(horse grunts, neighs)

01:04.431 --> 01:05.898
(neighing)

01:07.701 --> 01:09.101
(stressed neighing)

01:09.103 --> 01:10.035
(electricity crackling)

01:10.170 --> 01:11.970
(thuds)

01:11.972 --> 01:14.939
(tense orchestral music)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.521
(hart): Julia, you made it.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.990
(julia): Told me
you owned a horse.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.859
I had no idea you rode.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.928
- Oh, one of my few talents.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.997
Cool million here
is a joy to ride.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.133
(hart chuckles)
- he's beautiful.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.334
- One of the few things
I got to keep in the settlement

01:43.370 --> 01:44.802
From the carmichaels.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.072
Can't even afford
a trainer or a jockey.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.675
- He's a racehorse?
- Indeed and a good one.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.876
I wanted to run him
in the qualifier

01:50.945 --> 01:51.944
For the nationals.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.078
- Violet hart?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.515
How nice to see you.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.116
- Mr. Carmichael.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.486
Julia ogden,
this is emmett carmichael.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.021
My late husband's cousin.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.088
- Charmed.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.558
Terribly sorry about
all that legal business.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.560
Family matters, you know
how these things are.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.362
- Of course.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.030
- They really did take

02:12.032 --> 02:14.165
Everything from you,
didn't they?

02:14.201 --> 02:16.101
(sighs)
father's a bastard.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.435
So is mother.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.305
Are you able to afford
the stable fees here?

02:21.175 --> 02:22.174
- I'm making do.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.909
- Well, if it becomes a burden,

02:23.911 --> 02:26.311
Happy to take your animal
off your hands.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.981
- Thank you for your offer,
but he's my horse.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.114
(horse grunts)

02:30.151 --> 02:32.918
- Surely. Well, must go.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.953
Ladies.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.128
- Your former in-law?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.331
- I'm just glad to be free
from the lot of them.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.532
(man): No!

02:47.601 --> 02:49.033
- What was that?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.803
Dear god. What's happened?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.538
- It's mrs. Marshall's horse.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.941
He's-he's dead.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.644
I just came in and found him
like this.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.978
Must be colic.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.880
- Colic?
- Horses die from it

03:01.949 --> 03:04.783
All the time. Sometimes,
you don't see it coming.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.819
Mrs. Marshall
will be heartbroken.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.090
- I don't think he passed
away naturally.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.692
This horse has a broken neck.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.060
I believe he was murdered.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.635
(soft music)

03:23.671 --> 03:25.203
(neighing)

03:26.439 --> 03:28.974
- Well, see if you can find
more fuel somewhere.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.643
Sir!

03:31.645 --> 03:34.712
Do we really both need to attend
to the murder of a horse?

03:35.683 --> 03:37.115
- This wasn't just any horse,
murdoch.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.583
This was baccarat.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.252
He was the favourite
to win the national.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.788
- Oh, yes. The qualifiers
are this time of year.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.389
- This weekend.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.258
Baccarat's owners won it
three years running

03:46.260 --> 03:48.192
With a bay called thunderbolt.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.995
This year they bought a ringer.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.596
Baccarat won
the missouri stakes.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.466
- I had no idea you knew
so much about horse racing.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.869
But, still, sir. Why both of us?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.738
- The horse was worth $20,000.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.072
- Tw...

04:01.108 --> 04:02.874
That's more than my house.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.343
- As you can see,
it's a matter of interest.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.545
Plus, I myself am a victim.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.414
I had $20 on the bugger.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.284
Ah, baccarat.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.086
What do we think?

04:14.221 --> 04:16.754
- Well, it's a racehorse
with a broken neck.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.890
- Not a clue how
it could've happened.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.425
(light switch clicking)

04:20.461 --> 04:22.227
They just put in
the electricity.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.795
It goes in and out.

04:24.831 --> 04:25.964
- And you are?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.566
- Chappy farnsworth.

04:27.701 --> 04:31.235
I'm the farrier who cares
for this animal. Cared for.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.871
- So, you found him, then?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.572
- I came in to shoe him,

04:34.642 --> 04:36.041
Found him like this.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.177
I left him in his stall
at nine o'clock last night.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.246
(murdoch): So, he died during
that window of time.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.849
- I'm happy to examine him.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.717
I know a thing or two
about horses.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.587
- As do I. I could
perform a postmortem.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.288
- Strictly speaking,
this is a case

04:50.357 --> 04:51.923
Of malicious mischief.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.059
The victim here
is not the animal,

04:54.128 --> 04:55.594
But the animal's owner.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.295
- I beg to differ, murdoch.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.132
I believe the victim is
the bloody horse. Look at him.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.501
- Yes. Well, the animal
will need to be examined,

05:02.503 --> 05:05.537
But baccarat is evidence
in a crime

05:05.539 --> 05:09.074
And, as such, I will be
collecting his remains.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.242
- Well, I'll have him
taken to the morgue.

05:11.312 --> 05:14.078
- Miss hart, you are either
directly or indirectly

05:14.114 --> 05:15.880
Involved in this case.
I don't believe you should

05:15.916 --> 05:17.215
Conduct the postmortem.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.084
- Well, as you wish.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.488
- Mr. Farnsworth--
- suppose you want me gone,

05:23.623 --> 05:26.892
As well. You find out
what happened, detective.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.361
- What exactly are you planning
to do with a 1,000-pound

05:29.430 --> 05:30.695
Piece of evidence?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.363
It definitely won't
fit in your office.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.967
- Sir, this is not a typical
murder case,

05:35.969 --> 05:39.037
But we still need to establish
motive, time of death.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.973
- Well, he would fit through
the doors of the morgue.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.643
With miss hart recused from
the case, I could take a look.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.178
- Bloody hell.
Let's drag him back, then.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.380
- Right.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.449
And we will obtain
fingermarks from this stall.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.588
Locate and question anyone
who may have accessed

05:56.590 --> 05:59.123
These stables
in the past 24 hours.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.492
But first,
your help may be needed.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.896
- Sir, I have baccarat's
owners just this way.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.266
(exhales deeply)

06:11.138 --> 06:13.938
This is mr. Bruce marshall
and mrs. Scarlet marshall, sir,

06:14.007 --> 06:15.006
The horse's owners.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.274
- My wife is the owner.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.009
The stables are scarlet's
bailiwick.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.146
- I can't believe it.
It's too terrible.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.114
- Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.182
- Not the slightest.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.283
- I have.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.818
It was one
of the other owners.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.888
- None of them would kill
an innocent horse, bruce!

06:29.957 --> 06:32.757
- It's the national qualifiers,
dear, and you win every year.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.091
They're jealous.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.361
I wouldn't put it past
a single one of the scoundrels.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.030
- Who are these other owners?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.766
- Why don't you speak
to our trainer, mr. West.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.767
He knows all the horses,
all the owners,

06:42.836 --> 06:44.102
Everyone involved.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.403
Mr. West!

06:46.273 --> 06:48.372
(scarlet breathes heavily)

06:49.410 --> 06:50.508
- Oh, guy!

06:51.345 --> 06:53.111
How could this have happened?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.446
- It's terrible, ma'am.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.380
- My wife is in a state.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.516
We'll be at our home
if you need anything else.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.388
- You're the horse's trainer,
sir?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.325
- That's right. I've been
working with him for months.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.194
- When were you last with him?

07:09.263 --> 07:12.230
- Yesterday.
Put him in his stall and...

07:12.266 --> 07:13.665
Fed him around six.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.600
- Did he seem unwell?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.069
- No, sir. Had great pace
'round the track,

07:18.071 --> 07:19.704
Real healthy appetite.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.274
Poor old boy.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.008
- We need the names
of the other owners

07:24.044 --> 07:26.344
Who also have horses
in this race.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.880
- Surely, but you'll
only need one.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.082
I mean, everyone knows
who did this.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.351
- Oh? Who's that?

07:33.353 --> 07:36.020
- Has to be the man who came
in second the past two years.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.056
Emmett carmichael.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.158
- Ma'am.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.093
- Do I recognize you
from somewhere?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.761
- I don't believe we've met.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.096
- I'm violet hart.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.765
- Joey witherspoon.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.300
- Witherspoon?
- Mm-hmm.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.435
- Of course! You're famous.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.170
- Ha! Hardly.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.372
- Well, you won
the kentucky derby twice.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.242
- Oof. That was some time ago.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.711
You were the best jockey
in the world at a time.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.379
What on earth
are you doing here?

08:01.381 --> 08:03.448
- Things have been changing
in the south.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.618
Some of us old jockeys
aren't welcome anymore;

08:06.753 --> 08:08.119
Not the right type.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.320
- Oh, that's awful.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.189
- Yeah. I got off easy.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.057
Fired, run out of town.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.860
Some other fellas got
the stuffing beat out of 'em,

08:15.929 --> 08:17.328
Or worse:

08:17.364 --> 08:19.331
Fell off their horses mid-race.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.799
- They'd be trampled.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.233
- I had a friend nearly die.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.936
I'm lucky I just
lost all my money.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.705
- Oh, I know what that's like.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.675
Well, at least you've landed
on your feet.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.078
Will you be riding
diamond duke?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.946
- Oh, afraid not.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.548
Mr. Carmichael,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.283
He hired me on as a trainer,
but he don't want

08:38.418 --> 08:39.818
A black jockey riding for him.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.420
- But you're joey witherspoon.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.088
You should be on a horse.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.957
You should be racing.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.992
- This is what I do now.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.430
Eh, anyhow, don't be letting
go of that horse.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.098
I seen you riding.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.033
He's got something
special in him.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.804
(soft music)

08:59.940 --> 09:01.539
(indistinct chatter)

09:02.709 --> 09:04.976
- Mr. Carmichael, if you would.

09:10.951 --> 09:15.053
- I was at le chateau carmichael
until after 2am.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.088
You can ask anyone who was
working there last night.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.990
- You own the restaurant?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.992
- Well, I do now.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.194
I inherited it from
my late cousin, arthur.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.529
I think you knew him.
- Ah. A bit.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.132
My condolences.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.734
And after 2am?

09:30.737 --> 09:31.870
- Went home.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.005
Tried to make
a deviled cheese sandwich,

09:34.140 --> 09:35.206
Dropped a plate.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.475
My valet was woken
by the racket.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.077
He can vouch for me.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.147
- Your competitors,

09:42.282 --> 09:44.081
The other horse owners,

09:44.117 --> 09:45.950
Seem to think that
you are the most likely

09:46.019 --> 09:49.087
To resort to foul play
in order to win this race.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.624
- Well, they are mistaking
my desire to win

09:53.660 --> 09:55.627
For a depravity of character.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.229
I want to win more
than anything, that is true.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.832
But there is one thing
I want more

10:01.868 --> 10:04.835
And that is to win
fair and square.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.706
(indistinct chatter)

10:13.814 --> 10:15.580
- Inspector.
- What is it, murdoch?

10:15.649 --> 10:19.184
- I've collected alibis from
all of the rival horse owners,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.119
Their jockeys, trainers,

10:21.188 --> 10:23.788
Stable hands and anyone else
who may have had access

10:23.824 --> 10:25.322
To baccarat's stall.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.492
- And you've compared them
to the marks you found?

10:27.494 --> 10:29.327
- Correct. And there were
too many fingermarks

10:29.396 --> 10:31.195
To single out one culprit.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.129
- And the alibis?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.801
- Sir, julia is still examining
the animal at the morgue.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.336
She doesn't yet have
a time of death.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.336
We'll know more soon.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.006
- This case will be
the death of me, murdoch.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.541
Those seven owners
are all convinced

10:43.543 --> 10:45.410
That their horse will be
the next victim

10:45.479 --> 10:47.211
And they won't let me
hear the end of it!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.414
I have to have constables
patrolling their stables

10:49.416 --> 10:50.415
24 hours a day.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.416
- Ah, ah, ah!

10:51.485 --> 10:54.819
I believe I've found
another way.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.223
(gulps)

10:58.358 --> 10:59.424
(sighs)

11:01.227 --> 11:02.861
An idea came to me

11:02.863 --> 11:05.763
When we were installing cameras
for surveillance purposes

11:05.832 --> 11:06.964
Last winter.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.101
What if instead
of constantly surveilling,

11:10.137 --> 11:13.004
You took a photograph only
at the relevant moment?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.572
- You mean hire a photographer?

11:15.775 --> 11:17.441
Why not just get a constable
to stand watch?

11:17.477 --> 11:20.178
- No, no, no. I-I've devised
a way to achieve the same result

11:20.313 --> 11:22.313
Without need for a constable,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.648
Or a photographer,
or anyone at all.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.650
- You mean the camera
takes a picture on its own

11:26.687 --> 11:28.119
When someone walks past?

11:28.254 --> 11:29.554
- Precisely.

11:29.623 --> 11:30.855
- How does it know?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.390
Someone's got to tell it.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.657
- We--

11:33.694 --> 11:36.594
I've invented
a motion perceptor.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.730
This lens on top of the camera

11:38.865 --> 11:40.665
Can detect changes
in light levels.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.534
A gradual change,
uh, the sun setting,

11:43.570 --> 11:46.337
And it won't register.
But a rapid change,

11:46.339 --> 11:49.006
Such as someone walking past
and casting a shadow,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.609
And it will trigger
this shutter.

11:51.611 --> 11:52.543
(camera whirring)

11:52.579 --> 11:54.044
- And that's when it
takes a photo?

11:55.148 --> 11:56.681
- Well, that's the idea.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.750
Shall we try it?

11:58.752 --> 12:03.021
Inspector, if you could
walk past the camera?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.222
(playful music)

12:06.893 --> 12:08.393
(camera shutter clicks)

12:09.463 --> 12:10.695
- So the camera
is set off by motion.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.164
I know what else
you could use this for.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.900
Wait a minute, murdoch.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.535
Oi, crawford! Wait there!

12:20.407 --> 12:22.106
I want my $20 back.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.175
- Oh, tough luck, inspector.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.844
No refunds on bad bets.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.645
- Baccarat's not running.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.714
In case you haven't heard,
he's dead.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.850
- Oh. That's no concern of mine.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.419
If your horse doesn't come in,
you don't win. That-that's it.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.589
- I could arrest you for this.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.524
- You placed the bet.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.692
You'd have to arrest yourself,
too.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.196
Right then.
(chuckles)

12:45.331 --> 12:46.730
Care to make another wager?

12:48.068 --> 12:49.233
(sighs)

12:51.904 --> 12:53.070
- It's quite a sight.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.874
Any idea what happened
to him yet?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.343
- I believe his heart stopped,

12:58.478 --> 13:00.478
Which would be consistent
with a number of ailments

13:00.613 --> 13:04.883
If it weren't for the fact that
he broke his neck in the fall.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.684
- Meaning the fall was sudden.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.219
- That's right. In

13:08.288 --> 13:10.955
The case of heart attacks
in horses,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.090
They generally
stumble to the ground.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.627
A stroke might have been
more sudden,

13:15.762 --> 13:18.563
But there's no evidence
for that here.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.698
(sighs)

13:20.767 --> 13:21.866
- Time of death?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.802
- Well, the indicators for that
are different in horses

13:24.805 --> 13:28.439
Than humans, but I believe
the state of rigor

13:28.441 --> 13:30.575
And the opacity of his eyes

13:30.577 --> 13:33.878
Suggest he died
between 10pm and 1am.

13:33.880 --> 13:34.745
- Oh!

13:35.849 --> 13:38.583
Well, that exonerates
a number of suspects,

13:38.718 --> 13:40.919
Including mr. Carmichael.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.187
- There is one other
interesting thing

13:43.256 --> 13:46.457
I can't find
any explanation for.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.158
It may be unrelated.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.198
- His ear is... Singed?

13:54.201 --> 13:56.000
- As if someone held
a match to it.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.802
(ominous music)

14:00.040 --> 14:02.073
- Could this have been caused
by electricity?

14:04.410 --> 14:05.810
- It could have been.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.278
(clicking)

14:07.413 --> 14:09.013
- Mr. Farnsworth said
the electricity

14:09.148 --> 14:10.682
Was recently installed.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.551
- And yet the lights
aren't working. How odd.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.354
- Could someone
have disconnected the lights

14:16.356 --> 14:19.424
In order to use the electricity
for something else?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.092
- You mean to electrocute
baccarat?

14:21.161 --> 14:22.360
- Is that possible?

14:22.429 --> 14:23.828
- Actually, yes.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.964
Large animals can be killed
by electricity

14:26.099 --> 14:27.599
Far more easily than humans.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.034
The charge from an exposed wire

14:30.070 --> 14:31.836
Is enough to stop
a horse's heart.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.974
- Could someone
have disconnected the wires

14:37.110 --> 14:38.509
In order to close a circuit

14:38.645 --> 14:41.913
Between baccarat's ear
and its... Rear?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.447
- They very well could have.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.582
That would explain why we found
singe marks

14:45.619 --> 14:49.753
On the horse's backside,
as well as his ear.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.190
And then he would have died
so quickly

14:52.325 --> 14:54.058
That the collapse
broke his neck.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.460
- Thousand-pound animal.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.730
Someone has tampered
with this light.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.331
- So, this was intentional.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.666
- Let's see if the culprit
has left any fingermarks.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.870
(hart): Mr. Witherspoon.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.239
I have a proposal for you.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.775
- Ma'am?

15:10.844 --> 15:13.110
- Ride cool million
in the national qualifier.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.414
- Well, thank you for the offer,
but that's not possible.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.482
- Why not?

15:18.518 --> 15:20.018
- Well, for one thing,

15:20.153 --> 15:22.754
Cool million's not running
in the qualifier.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.956
- Well, with baccarat out,
there's a spot open.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.290
I can get him in the race.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.760
- Look, I would love
to get back in the saddle.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.495
But I need my job.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.631
And mr. Carmichael
would not be pleased.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.371
- It makes no bloody sense,
murdoch.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.639
That man was nearly in tears
last time I saw him.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.909
- Our farrier mr. Farnsworth's
fingermarks

15:44.978 --> 15:46.643
Were the only ones found.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.179
- Why would he want
to kill a horse?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.614
- I have no idea,
but we're about to find out.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.549
(sinister music)

15:54.854 --> 15:56.054
Oh.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.389
- Seems like you were
wrong about that.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.265
- It appears he was killed
with a single strike

16:08.335 --> 16:09.566
To the head,
likely a heavy implement

16:09.602 --> 16:12.536
With some sort of indentation
or bifurcation at the end.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.539
- And there's a tool missing
from his farrier's tool kit.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.807
I think it's one
of the iron tongs

16:16.843 --> 16:18.009
That they use to shoe horses.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.078
- Two are missing, actually.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.179
One is in his hand.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.349
If both men were armed,

16:25.352 --> 16:28.019
That could indicate
a fight that went badly.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.289
- Well, if the killer did use
something he found in here,

16:31.424 --> 16:33.157
We're not looking at
premeditated murder.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.927
- There are boot marks
in the blood,

16:36.062 --> 16:38.229
But too messy
to tell us anything.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.064
And what's this?

16:40.199 --> 16:41.499
(brackenreid):
What have you found?

16:44.037 --> 16:45.236
- Haven't a clue.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.771
- Is it a tooth?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.706
- Appears to be ceramic.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.309
Perhaps it broke off
of the murder weapon.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.244
- Strange.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.980
Why would anyone want to kill
this farnsworth bloke, anyway?

16:56.850 --> 16:59.183
- Farnsworth killed baccarat.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.586
Someone found out
and confronted him,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.121
Perhaps the marshalls?

17:03.123 --> 17:04.922
- Or that trainer of theirs.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.858
- Farnsworth is dead?

17:06.860 --> 17:09.226
- Murdered. In the tack room.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.494
- Well, that's terrible.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.664
He'd been working
for mrs. Marshall for years.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.833
- He's been established
as the culprit

17:15.835 --> 17:17.135
In the killing of baccarat.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.671
- Wha...?
Well, that's not possible.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.675
- We found this in his room.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.610
We believe he was paid to do it.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.546
- Perhaps you found out
and went to have a word

17:28.548 --> 17:29.914
With mr. Farnsworth.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.417
You knew he'd killed baccarat
and the two of you fought.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.018
- Don't care much
for what you're suggesting.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.288
- Things got out of hand;
perhaps it was self-defence.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.156
- No.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.692
No, you got it all wrong.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.828
I wasn't even at the stables
this afternoon.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.962
I left around one o'clock.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.697
- Can anyone corroborate this?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.500
(sighs)
- I don't know.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.837
Wait. As I was leaving,
I seen that bookmaker.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.440
- Eddie crawford?
- Yeah.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.641
That's right. He was there.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.343
He... He would have
seen me leave.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.880
Since last week,
he's been hanging around.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.984
- Maybe because he's a bookie
he stood to make a fortune

18:06.986 --> 18:08.519
If baccarat didn't run.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.456
- What's all this?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.390
- I'm running cool million
in the qualifier.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.593
- You've listed me
as your jockey.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.994
- That's right.
(scoffs)

18:16.996 --> 18:18.262
- You don't have the right.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.664
I didn't agree to this.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.965
- But you want to.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.867
With my horse and you
as his jockey,

18:22.869 --> 18:24.268
We could win this.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.537
You don't belong working
as a trainer.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.472
You belong on the racecourse,

18:28.541 --> 18:30.808
Riding in the biggest
races in the world.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.343
Look, picture it.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.544
With baccarat out,

18:33.679 --> 18:35.546
All we have to do
is beat carmichael.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.214
And we can do it.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.785
- Even if I agreed,

18:43.222 --> 18:45.089
Who's to say
they'll allow me to run?

18:45.091 --> 18:46.891
- They've already allowed it.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.559
Your name's on the racing sheet.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.561
- And the trainers,

18:50.563 --> 18:53.430
The owners, the jockeys?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.432
I've been run out
of town before.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.935
- You have just as much
of a right to race as they do.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.337
- And carmichael?

19:01.574 --> 19:04.375
I have a contract with him,
and I need the money.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.043
- Let me handle carmichael.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.645
As for money,

19:07.647 --> 19:09.713
When we split the purse,
we'll both be flush.

19:10.850 --> 19:11.915
What do you say?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.156
- You cheated me out of $20.

19:19.159 --> 19:22.259
- But I-I didn't cheat you!
You made a bad bet.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.027
- I didn't know you were
going to kill the horse

19:24.063 --> 19:26.396
To fix that race.
You paid that farrier to do it

19:26.432 --> 19:28.865
So you could collect the bets
on baccarat, isn't that right?

19:28.902 --> 19:30.467
- I did no such thing.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.868
- What happened?

19:31.905 --> 19:33.471
Farnsworth was going
to give you up, is that it?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.607
So you killed him?
- What? I didn't kill anyone.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.744
- Then why were you
at the stables today?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.212
And if you lie to me,

19:42.248 --> 19:43.547
I will lock you up
for bookmaking

19:43.616 --> 19:45.683
And then I will lock myself
up alongside ya.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.951
Do you understand?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.285
(murdoch): Sir, please.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.960
Tell us what you do know,
mr. Crawford.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.966
- I did want baccarat
out of the race, all right?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.303
But I didn't pay this farnsworth
and I certainly didn't kill him!

20:07.206 --> 20:08.438
- But you did do something

20:08.474 --> 20:10.007
To prevent baccarat
from running.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.910
- Yes. I asked someone
to make sure he didn't run.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.513
- Not farnsworth?
- No.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.048
I don't know him.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.651
I have a client
who owes me a lot of money.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.720
He's more than $1,000 in debt.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.388
- You let someone bet $1,000?

20:24.523 --> 20:26.056
- I thought he was rich.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.059
Turns out he's flat broke,

20:28.061 --> 20:30.328
Squandered his whole fortune.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.929
So, I told him,

20:32.064 --> 20:34.931
"if you can make it
so baccarat doesn't run,

20:34.968 --> 20:36.667
You don't have
to pay your debt."

20:36.802 --> 20:38.336
He told me it was taken care of.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.203
- Right. Who is this man?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.439
- Bruce marshall.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.707
Baccarat's owner.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.644
(horse exhales)

20:50.149 --> 20:51.816
- Here to say no?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.817
- I'm here to see what he's got.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.321
(horse grunts)

21:00.360 --> 21:02.026
- Well, well.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.227
That's a fine horse after all.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.097
Probably a good thing
you didn't give it to me.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.767
- Well, I know what things
are worth, mr. Carmichael.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.636
- You're a sharp tack,
miss hart.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.772
I can see what my cousin
saw in you.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.707
He spoke of you often, you know.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.210
- Funny. He never
spoke of you at all.

21:19.212 --> 21:20.444
(exhales)

21:20.513 --> 21:21.712
- Yes, well,

21:21.748 --> 21:23.914
Suppose he never will
again thanks to...

21:24.884 --> 21:27.117
What in the holy blazes?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.687
That's my trainer on your horse!

21:29.756 --> 21:30.755
- That's right.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.122
- What are you two playing at?

21:32.158 --> 21:33.590
I have him under contract.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.692
- Let me make you an offer.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.929
Let witherspoon ride for me
in the qualifier.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.866
If he wins,
he's free of his employment.

21:41.868 --> 21:42.933
If you win,

21:43.002 --> 21:44.802
I'll pay you back the full
value of the contract.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.938
- I'm sorry. Win?

21:48.074 --> 21:49.874
You think that horse
is gonna win?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.808
- Are you in, or are you out?

21:53.179 --> 21:55.412
- All right.
All right, miss hart.

21:56.682 --> 21:57.948
You got yourself a bet.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.354
(carmichael chuckles)

22:08.961 --> 22:12.029
- It's true. I plotted
to kill that poor horse.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.898
I had to, don't you see?

22:14.734 --> 22:16.466
I'm ruined. I have nothing.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.970
My wife can't find out.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.172
Please don't tell her!

22:21.307 --> 22:22.239
- We're more interested

22:22.275 --> 22:24.241
In what happened
with mr. Farnsworth.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.243
- Did he threaten
to call the police?

22:26.312 --> 22:27.578
Is that why you killed him?

22:27.713 --> 22:28.979
- What?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.581
I didn't kill chappy.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.316
- You had him kill baccarat.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.151
- No. No, I didn't.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.185
- You just admitted you did.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.789
- No, I hired someone
else altogether.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.333
- You're witherspoon, eh?
The joey witherspoon?

22:50.370 --> 22:52.269
- That's right.
- The horse looks fast.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.738
- He is.
- Hm.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.473
I'm gonna have to be careful
setting the odds on him.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.011
Oh, come on, gents!

23:01.080 --> 23:03.480
Can't you leave a man
in peace for two minutes?

23:03.516 --> 23:04.815
- We're not here for you,
mr. Crawford.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.350
(brackenreid):
We're here for him.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.685
- What do you want with him?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.687
- Mr. Witherspoon,
we'd like to ask you

23:09.822 --> 23:13.223
Some questions regarding
the murder of chappy farnsworth.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.758
- Me? Why?

23:14.794 --> 23:15.826
- Well, for one thing,

23:15.961 --> 23:18.228
You appear to have some
blood on your pants.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.233
(tense music)

23:27.907 --> 23:30.207
- Mr. Marshall paid me
to kill baccarat.

23:31.043 --> 23:31.909
But I never went
through with it.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.043
I couldn't.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.980
And I was about to tell him
I was calling it off,

23:37.016 --> 23:39.349
But then baccarat
ended up dead anyway.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.319
So, I just kept my mouth shut.

23:42.355 --> 23:45.055
- We already know
farnsworth killed the horse.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.858
The question is,
why did you kill farnsworth?

23:47.927 --> 23:48.993
- I didn't.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.863
- Mr. Witherspoon,
you have blood on your pants.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.199
(sighs)

23:55.268 --> 23:57.200
- I was taking out duke

23:57.236 --> 23:59.002
And I needed a crop.

23:59.038 --> 24:03.174
So, I went into the tack room
and I saw him.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.678
There was blood all around,

24:07.680 --> 24:11.314
But maybe he was still alive,
you know?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.450
So, I went to check.
- Was he?

24:13.585 --> 24:15.652
- No. He was gone.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.756
By then, my hands
were covered in blood.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.325
I'd knelt in it, too,

24:23.296 --> 24:25.328
And I knew if I called for help,

24:26.232 --> 24:27.564
I'd be blamed for it.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.835
Just like I'm being
blamed for it now.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.638
(soft ominous music)

24:37.076 --> 24:38.709
(indistinct chatter)

24:39.679 --> 24:41.245
- Ah! Miss hart.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.713
- He didn't do it.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.581
- And how exactly
do you know that?

24:44.617 --> 24:47.050
- Because I know him.
He's a good man.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.252
Don't you know who he is?

24:48.387 --> 24:50.054
He won the kentucky derby twice.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.189
- And that means
he's not a killer?

24:52.324 --> 24:53.624
- He can't be.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.359
And he would never
hurt an animal.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.394
- You're wrong about that,
miss hart.

24:57.430 --> 25:00.464
Mr. Marshall did hire him
to kill baccarat.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.399
He just didn't get around
to doing it.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.202
- And he had mr. Farnsworth's
blood on his pants.

25:06.439 --> 25:09.206
- So you can see why
we find his story unlikely.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.542
I am struggling, however,
to believe that he'd want

25:12.578 --> 25:14.210
To kill mr. Farnsworth.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.046
- Maybe he didn't have
the stomach to go through

25:16.082 --> 25:18.215
With killing the horse,
so he hired farnsworth

25:18.284 --> 25:20.083
To do it for him.
Then they fought

25:20.119 --> 25:21.851
When farnsworth threatened
to turn him in.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.887
- We can't prove that,
but it would answer

25:23.890 --> 25:25.756
Both of our remaining questions.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.291
- Could I speak with him?

25:30.963 --> 25:33.163
- Taking that money
from mr. Marshall

25:33.199 --> 25:35.566
Was the lowest moment
of my life, miss hart.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.635
And now it's come back
to haunt me.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.771
Just when things
were looking up.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.777
- Joey, at this moment,
I need to know the truth.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.713
If you did any of this,
detective murdoch will find out.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.916
- I didn't kill farnsworth.
I just found him like that.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.985
- And you didn't ask him
to electrocute baccarat?

25:56.822 --> 25:57.821
- Electrocute?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.857
- They believe that's how
baccarat was killed.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.960
- I had nothing to do with that,
but...

26:04.931 --> 26:06.263
I have heard of it.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.264
- When?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.600
- There were rumours
about it back in kentucky.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.203
They said it could never
be found out.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.140
It would look just like
the horse

26:16.275 --> 26:18.074
Dropped dead from colic.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.376
- Who was doing it?

26:19.412 --> 26:20.611
Were they fixing races?

26:20.680 --> 26:21.611
- No, no.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.347
It wasn't that kind of scheme.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.151
It was a way for the owner
to kill his own horse.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.121
(brackenreid): So, what good
would killing it do?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.490
- A lot if your horse
is insured.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.092
- Not if it was killed
deliberately.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.761
- Correct. There can't be
any hint of foul play.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.430
The cause of death has to fall
under a named peril.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.833
- A cause of death acceptable
to the insurers,

26:42.902 --> 26:44.635
Accident, illness.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.637
- An electrocution could
look like the horse died

26:46.772 --> 26:47.971
Of natural causes,

26:48.007 --> 26:50.206
Unless someone clever
discovers singe marks.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.610
- So are we saying that baccarat
wasn't going to qualify?

26:54.647 --> 26:56.380
- It would seem to be
the only reason

26:56.382 --> 26:58.248
To kill him before the race.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.583
- Well, what was wrong with him?

27:01.920 --> 27:03.186
(murdoch): What am I looking at?

27:03.255 --> 27:06.856
- Discolouration running
horizontally across the radius.

27:08.628 --> 27:09.926
- Oh.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.196
Are you sure it isn't
a cyst, or a, uh...?

27:13.232 --> 27:15.666
- No. I believe
it's a healed fracture.

27:16.935 --> 27:19.136
- Well, when did
this fracture occur?

27:19.138 --> 27:21.271
- It's no more
than two months old.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.107
I'd say it's healed,
but likely weakened.

27:25.578 --> 27:30.014
- So if this horse had run
full speed in a race...?

27:31.283 --> 27:33.183
- It would have been liable
to cause a full break.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.419
- Well, that's not possible.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.888
- Baccarat couldn't win,

27:37.890 --> 27:39.856
So you made sure you didn't
lose your investment.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.558
- You had him killed
so you could collect

27:41.627 --> 27:42.792
The insurance money.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.363
- I assure you I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.700
If you claim baccarat
was injured,

27:49.702 --> 27:52.169
I certainly knew nothing
about it.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.571
I only bought the horse
a month ago.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.906
When do you suppose
all of this happened?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.778
- Who did you buy him from?
- A broker.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.280
(sighs)
mister...

28:04.316 --> 28:06.182
Mr. Dalton, I believe.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.551
- Where can we find him?

28:07.620 --> 28:09.853
- I wouldn't know.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.722
My trainer introduced me to him.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.323
- Mr. West?
- Yes.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.459
- When was this?
- Couple months ago.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.228
(scoffs)
look, there must be

28:18.363 --> 28:20.197
Some mistake here.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.665
Mr. West thoroughly
inspected the horse

28:22.702 --> 28:24.201
Before I purchased him.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.136
He would never advise me

28:26.172 --> 28:28.271
To buy an injured horse.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.174
- Ah, sir?

28:30.176 --> 28:32.276
I believe we've found what
we've been looking for.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.677
- Regarding mr. West?

28:33.746 --> 28:35.879
- Yes. It seems he has
somewhat of a reputation.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.348
He likes to gain the confidence
of wealthy horse owners

28:38.417 --> 28:40.551
In order to get hired on
as a trainer.

28:40.686 --> 28:44.354
He then convinces them
to invest in a can't-miss horse.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.990
- Exactly what he did
to mrs. Marshall with baccarat.

28:46.992 --> 28:48.491
- So it would seem.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.960
- So, what's in it for him
if his boss buys a bad horse?

28:50.996 --> 28:52.428
He's not the one
selling the horse.

28:52.465 --> 28:55.099
- In new york state,
mr. West was arrested

28:55.234 --> 28:57.034
And charged with fraud.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.436
Similar circumstances,
but he was never convicted.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.871
In that case,
mr. West's own brother

29:01.907 --> 29:04.274
Was the seller acting
under a false name.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.443
- So the brothers find
an old champion racehorse

29:07.480 --> 29:08.912
With a gammy leg.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.781
They then pretend
to be strangers

29:10.916 --> 29:12.783
And swindle an old lady
out of thousands.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.351
They then split the proceeds.
So these west brothers

29:15.387 --> 29:17.521
Had to kill baccarat
before he ran,

29:17.523 --> 29:20.057
Or else mrs. Marshall
would know she'd been conned.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.659
- I believe we have our culprit.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.996
- Uh, sir. Mr. Witherspoon.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.565
Have you seen guy west?

29:28.601 --> 29:30.000
- Mr. West?

29:30.135 --> 29:31.201
No, I haven't seen him.

29:31.336 --> 29:33.603
- Ask around, would you?
We need a word with him.

29:35.608 --> 29:36.807
(neighing)
huh?

29:36.809 --> 29:38.208
(grunts)
- dear god! Look out!

29:42.148 --> 29:43.680
(grunting)

29:49.255 --> 29:50.153
Mr. Witherspoon!

29:50.222 --> 29:50.687
(groaning)

29:50.756 --> 29:51.488
He's breathing.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.023
- Joey! Are you all right?

29:53.025 --> 29:56.894
- My sides. I
can hardly breathe.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.628
- We need to get him
to a hospital.

29:58.664 --> 29:59.830
- Go and get help, henry.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.764
- Sir.
- It's all right. Hold still.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.200
(exhales deeply)

30:05.070 --> 30:05.969
- It was deliberate.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.873
The latch on his stall was open
and someone spurred him hard.

30:10.543 --> 30:11.441
- Whose horse was it?

30:11.510 --> 30:13.142
- Ah, a mr. Abernathy, sir.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.979
- The horse selection
was likely random.

30:16.114 --> 30:17.581
Any idea who did it?

30:17.650 --> 30:18.715
- It seems they got away, sir,

30:18.851 --> 30:21.185
But your motion perceptor
was triggered.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.519
- Oh, good.
We'll develop the film.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.790
- Sir, who would have it
out for mr. Witherspoon?

30:28.126 --> 30:31.261
- He's the one who put us
on to the insurance scheme.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.863
So, if this was retaliation,

30:32.932 --> 30:35.465
Our main suspect
could be responsible.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.602
Speak of the devil.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.138
- So, I heard mr. Carmichael,
uh, his trainer got hurt.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.339
What's going on?

30:42.474 --> 30:45.141
- Mr. West, we need
a moment of your time.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.878
You sold mrs. Marshall a horse

30:47.880 --> 30:50.580
With a fractured forelimb
and a false pedigree.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.016
You pretended to train it
for a month

30:53.052 --> 30:55.685
Knowing full well
that if it ran in the qualifier

30:55.721 --> 30:57.287
The truth would be exposed.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.489
(brackenreid): So you hired
farnsworth to kill it.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.225
- N-now, you can't prove that.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.461
- With baccarat dead,
mrs. Marshall would've collected

31:04.463 --> 31:07.331
The insurance money
and been none the wiser.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.465
No. No, I--
- but something went wrong,

31:09.501 --> 31:11.101
Didn't it?

31:11.170 --> 31:13.437
Baccarat died so quickly
during the electrocution

31:13.572 --> 31:17.441
That it broke its neck
during the fall. Messy.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.609
(brackenreid): But with us on
your case, farnsworth was going

31:19.645 --> 31:21.178
To roll you over.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.446
So you kill him.

31:23.448 --> 31:25.549
- And it likely
would have worked

31:25.551 --> 31:28.452
If joey witherspoon hadn't
put us on to your scheme.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.787
- Which is why you let
that horse loose on him.

31:30.823 --> 31:31.888
Payback.

31:35.861 --> 31:36.860
(sighs)

31:39.798 --> 31:40.863
- It's all true.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.866
I did it all.

31:45.871 --> 31:47.404
- As they say:

31:47.406 --> 31:51.140
When it goes wrong,
it all goes wrong.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.544
Guess I won't be riding
in the qualifier.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.781
- No. But you're going
to ride again.

31:57.783 --> 32:01.250
- Hm. I have to do something.
I don't have a job anymore.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.054
- I feel terrible about this.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.290
- Oh, hey now. Chin up.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.724
We're not cooked yet.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.092
- What do you mean?

32:10.029 --> 32:12.763
- Cool million
can win that race.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.097
You seen him run.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.299
He's faster than diamond duke

32:16.368 --> 32:19.102
And can run circles
around the rest of them.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.171
- But we don't have a jockey.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.673
- I know where we can get one.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.976
- He's confessed, murdoch.

32:26.111 --> 32:26.977
- Yes.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.712
- And you don't believe
a word of it.

32:28.714 --> 32:32.148
- Sir, we gave him a story
and he agreed to it.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.316
All of it.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.053
It was all terribly easy.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.588
- Sometimes things
are just neat and tidy.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.856
- I suppose so.

32:40.659 --> 32:41.858
But...

32:41.860 --> 32:45.328
Mr. West told us
that he saw eddie crawford

32:45.364 --> 32:49.199
Near the stables just before
mr. Farnsworth's murder.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.068
- Which means west
was there, too.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.835
- He also told us
he was leaving.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.805
- To give himself an alibi.

32:54.807 --> 32:55.938
He could have come back.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.907
- He certainly could have.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.342
- Let's say you're right

32:59.345 --> 33:00.744
And he really did leave
the stables

33:00.879 --> 33:02.746
Just before the murder.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.947
Why confess to a crime
that he didn't commit?

33:04.984 --> 33:07.484
- Perhaps he's protecting
someone.

33:07.553 --> 33:08.951
- Who?

33:13.859 --> 33:16.359
- This is what the motion
perception camera captured

33:16.428 --> 33:19.695
Right before joey witherspoon
was trampled.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.231
- Scarlet marshall.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.366
Why is west protecting her?

33:23.369 --> 33:24.434
- They're in it together.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.036
- She's cheating herself?

33:26.171 --> 33:28.305
- The marshalls are broke.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.973
Bruce marshall told us himself

33:30.108 --> 33:32.309
That he lost all of their money.

33:32.444 --> 33:33.977
- Begged us not
to tell his wife.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.912
- What if she already knows?

33:35.914 --> 33:37.914
- She knows that west
is a confidence man

33:37.983 --> 33:39.148
And she's broke.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.251
How's she buying expensive
horses in the first place?

33:42.287 --> 33:44.454
- Precisely. She's not.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.922
But she is pretending to

33:45.958 --> 33:48.992
And taking out large insurance
policies on the horses.

33:50.128 --> 33:51.728
- She never paid
anything for baccarat.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.397
- No. But she told
the insurance company she did.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.466
- And then when the horse dies,

33:56.601 --> 33:58.001
She doesn't get her money back,

33:59.071 --> 34:00.470
But she's collecting
thousands of dollars

34:00.539 --> 34:02.272
That she never even
spent in the first place.

34:02.341 --> 34:03.874
- Well, it's just a theory.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.976
- Based on a rather
compelling fact.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.379
- I've told the constables
to search her home.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.684
- You're saying
we killed my horse

34:14.753 --> 34:16.620
And then killed a man
to cover it up,

34:18.057 --> 34:19.623
All to make a little money.

34:19.758 --> 34:22.225
- A lot of money.
Money that you needed.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.894
- This is preposterous.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.363
And even if it were true,
you have no proof.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.967
- This photograph
was taken moments before

34:31.003 --> 34:33.569
Mr. Witherspoon was trampled.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.705
- What, earlier today?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.641
I was going there to meet guy.

34:37.776 --> 34:38.642
I couldn't find him.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.810
He had sent me a note to come.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.345
- Confirming you were there.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.514
- I-- I don't know, uh...

34:44.649 --> 34:46.583
- Anyway, what of it?

34:46.652 --> 34:49.185
Making a horse
run over some poor jockey

34:49.254 --> 34:51.621
Doesn't prove
that we killed someone.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.526
- We found these in the back
of your car, mrs. Marshall.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.794
- Wh-what is it?

34:58.831 --> 35:00.130
- Forge tongs.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.265
A farrier's tool
covered in blood.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.735
- These were missing
from mr. Farnsworth's tool kit

35:05.871 --> 35:07.604
When we found him dead.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.139
- In other words,

35:09.141 --> 35:11.741
We found the murder weapon
in your car.

35:12.845 --> 35:15.145
- I tried to take
the fall for you, scarlet.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.680
Really, I did.
- No. No.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.282
- I tried to save you.
- No, no, no. You have it--

35:19.318 --> 35:21.952
You have it all wrong.
It wasn't me.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.888
I-I've never seen this before
in my life.

35:26.224 --> 35:28.591
Please. We just--

35:29.394 --> 35:30.693
We just wanted some money.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.094
- Save it for the jury, darling.

35:32.131 --> 35:35.332
You two lovebirds are going
to be tried for murder.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.800
(gasping)

35:37.836 --> 35:40.904
So there was two separate plots
to kill the same horse.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.773
- Involving at least six people.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.977
Hard to believe a single animal
could draw so much ire.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.045
- Poor old baccarat
never stood a chance.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.114
Oh, and here's one of them now.
Oi, crawford!

35:52.351 --> 35:54.584
You're lucky that your pal
beat you to the punch.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.653
You might get off
facing any charges.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.522
- Huh. Always thinking
the worst of me, inspector.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.458
But, as usual,
I've done nothing wrong.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.327
- Don't push your luck,
sunshine.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.196
- Uh,

36:06.265 --> 36:08.130
What's, uh...

36:08.167 --> 36:09.366
What's all this?

36:09.368 --> 36:11.668
- Ah! This was my idea.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.336
Murdoch made a camera

36:13.338 --> 36:16.006
That takes photos
whenever someone walks past.

36:16.008 --> 36:19.475
So, I thought why not do it
with horses at the finish line?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.978
- I've adjusted the mechanism
so that the device

36:22.014 --> 36:23.880
Will take a series
of photographs

36:24.015 --> 36:25.481
Beginning the moment
the first horse

36:25.517 --> 36:27.350
Crosses the sensor.
(camera shutter clicks)

36:27.352 --> 36:29.485
Our finish photo

36:29.487 --> 36:30.887
Will then be able to tell us

36:30.956 --> 36:33.423
Which horse crosses
the line first.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.192
(gasps)
- a finish photo.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.160
- That was my idea.
- That's brilliant.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.028
This will settle
all of the arguments

36:39.064 --> 36:41.031
From bettors who think
their horse won

36:41.166 --> 36:44.167
In spite of what
the judges rule.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.369
Oh, speaking of,

36:46.405 --> 36:49.005
Gentlemen, do you care
to place any bets?

36:50.142 --> 36:53.175
- Now taking their places
at the starting line:

36:53.212 --> 36:55.345
Jericho jack,

36:55.347 --> 36:57.713
Maggie's fortune,

36:57.749 --> 36:59.149
Cool million!

36:59.284 --> 37:01.117
- Mrs. Hart must have
found a jockey

37:01.119 --> 37:02.986
For cool million after all.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.054
- What odds are your giving?
- Uh, I-I don't know.

37:05.123 --> 37:08.190
I mean, he runs fast,
but without witherspoon?

37:08.227 --> 37:09.459
- Just tell me the odds!

37:10.963 --> 37:12.796
- I'll give you four to one.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.864
- Twenty to win on cool million.
- Yeah.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.666
- To the line please, riders.

37:16.801 --> 37:19.402
(suspenseful music)

37:23.308 --> 37:25.108
(horses grunting)

37:28.046 --> 37:29.178
They're off!

37:29.248 --> 37:30.080
(crowd cheering)

37:30.215 --> 37:32.148
(man): Come on! Come on!

37:36.822 --> 37:37.987
- They'll be back.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.691
(courageous horn music)

38:09.354 --> 38:11.253
Miss hart's horse could
win this thing.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.794
(♪♪)

38:26.571 --> 38:28.471
- Cool million
and diamond duke

38:28.507 --> 38:29.672
Are neck and neck!

38:29.675 --> 38:31.273
(gasping, murmuring)

38:37.916 --> 38:39.882
(♪♪)

38:41.820 --> 38:44.554
(inaudible)

38:58.303 --> 38:59.569
(camera shutter clicking)

38:59.571 --> 39:02.238
(cheering)

39:03.174 --> 39:04.340
(laughing)

39:04.343 --> 39:07.109
And diamond duke is the winner.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.446
- Says who? It was a dead heat.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.247
- Take it easy, lads.

39:11.316 --> 39:12.982
We'll prove who was the winner
in just a minute.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.517
Isn't that right, murdoch?

39:14.652 --> 39:17.486
- Well, it was quite close.
Let's hope it worked.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.930
- And the winner is...

39:27.999 --> 39:28.798
Cool million!

39:28.867 --> 39:30.499
(clapping)

39:31.937 --> 39:33.403
- It seems we won by a nose.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.572
- Miss hart, that was you
riding cool million.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.839
- Now, wait a minute.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.743
Cool million can't
be the winner.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.878
Women are not allowed to jockey
in the qualifiers.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.180
And even if they were,

39:44.216 --> 39:46.816
Miss hart isn't the registered
jockey for this horse.

39:46.951 --> 39:50.954
Look at your racing forms.
They say joey witherspoon.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.556
Cool million
must be disqualified.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.126
- I'm afraid mr. Carmichael
is correct.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.063
Cool million is considered
scratched from this race.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.967
The winner is diamond duke!

40:03.969 --> 40:05.267
- Bloody hell.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.904
- Mr. Carmichael!

40:07.973 --> 40:10.106
I'll need to have a look
at your walking stick.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.041
- What's this all about?

40:12.043 --> 40:13.442
- Just hand it over.

40:14.312 --> 40:15.377
- Fine.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.883
- It's a match, sir.

40:19.885 --> 40:23.586
This was found at the scene
of mr. Farnsworth's murder.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.854
- It was you.

40:24.989 --> 40:27.190
You ordered baccarat's killing.
- Preposterous!

40:27.259 --> 40:29.459
- He threatened to talk,
so you killed him.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.160
- That's even more preposterous!

40:31.229 --> 40:34.130
- You ran over joey witherspoon
to keep him out of the race.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.665
- You even wrote the note
that lured

40:35.734 --> 40:37.200
Mrs. Marshall there, didn't you?

40:37.335 --> 40:39.401
- And planted
the murder weapon in her car.

40:39.438 --> 40:40.970
(crowd gasping)

40:41.105 --> 40:43.606
(tense music)

40:46.077 --> 40:47.677
(neighing)

40:47.679 --> 40:48.944
(grunts)

40:51.316 --> 40:52.481
- Come on, come on!

40:53.651 --> 40:55.784
- Go! Ha! Ha!

40:56.754 --> 40:58.654
(grunting)

41:10.936 --> 41:12.302
Mr. Carmichael,

41:13.171 --> 41:15.104
You are under arrest for murder.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.040
(sighs)

41:21.713 --> 41:23.646
- I won that race,
and you know it.

41:23.648 --> 41:24.446
- Maybe.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.982
But I still have
all your money.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.217
- Maybe so. But at least
I have my freedom.

41:28.220 --> 41:29.485
- You witch.

41:29.521 --> 41:30.854
- Get him out of here!

41:35.693 --> 41:38.394
- Looks like diamond duke
has also been disqualified.

41:38.463 --> 41:39.863
- Yes, I suppose race officials

41:39.998 --> 41:42.198
Frown upon murdering
your competition.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.000
- Hm.
- Are they reinstating

41:44.002 --> 41:45.201
Cool million as the winner?

41:45.336 --> 41:47.870
- Oh, no.
That disqualification stands.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.806
- Oh. Well, who won?

41:49.941 --> 41:53.108
- The horse that came
in third, Sunday best.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.345
- Ah! That's the horse I bet on.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.813
- You what? How's that?

41:57.883 --> 41:59.816
- Well, I-I read
the racing form.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.518
I analyzed the different
horses'
track records

42:02.554 --> 42:04.820
And measured those against
mr. Crawford's odds.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.290
I-I knew Sunday best
was an unlikely winner

42:07.425 --> 42:10.293
But could provide excellent
value for my bet.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.095
- What are the odds?

42:12.230 --> 42:13.096
- Fifty to one.

42:13.098 --> 42:15.231
- Oh!
- Ah! I don't believe this.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.368
- I may need some time
to raise the money.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.837
- But be sure that you do.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.238
- Ah! Ha...

42:23.842 --> 42:24.841
(murdoch laughing)

42:24.843 --> 42:26.675
- Ha! Ha...

42:27.679 --> 42:29.545
Sometimes a long shot
does pay off.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.080
(sighs)

42:36.721 --> 42:38.754
- So, what do you think?

42:38.756 --> 42:40.657
You gonna jockey again?

42:40.659 --> 42:42.658
- It didn't exactly
work out in our favour.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.794
I think I'm done
with horse racing.

42:44.863 --> 42:46.729
- You're not going to sell
cool million, are you?

42:46.864 --> 42:49.899
- No, sir. I'm going to put
him out to stud.

42:50.034 --> 42:53.469
News of his unofficial victory
has spread far and wide.

42:53.471 --> 42:54.803
I should make a pretty penny.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.072
- I should think so.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.674
I heard they're writing
the stories about the qualifier

42:58.743 --> 43:01.644
All the way over in europe.
- Is that so?

43:01.646 --> 43:04.146
- A friend sent me a telegram
inviting me to race.

43:05.216 --> 43:07.016
- You're going to give
racing another go?

43:07.018 --> 43:08.351
(exhales deeply)

43:08.353 --> 43:09.451
- I am.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.688
Thank you, violet.

43:13.491 --> 43:15.358
Without you,

43:15.360 --> 43:17.159
I would've never gotten
back in the saddle.

43:19.864 --> 43:21.463
- Goodbye, joey witherspoon.

43:24.702 --> 43:25.835
(engine starts)

43:25.837 --> 43:28.971
(bright rhythmic music)

43:41.519 --> 43:43.920
(mysterious music)
