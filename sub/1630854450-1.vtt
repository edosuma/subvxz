[haunting somber music plays]

01:08.500 --> 01:09.500
[woman] Hello.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.166
This is the beginning.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.958
The beginning of a film called The Wonder.

01:17.708 --> 01:20.250
The people you are about to meet,

01:20.333 --> 01:21.500
the characters,

01:22.125 --> 01:25.250
believe in their stories
with complete devotion.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.833
We are nothing without stories.

01:29.833 --> 01:32.458
And so we invite you
to believe in this one.

01:35.416 --> 01:37.791
It is 1862.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.208
We left England, bound for Ireland.

01:42.208 --> 01:45.500
The Great Famine
still casts a long shadow,

01:46.041 --> 01:49.875
and the Irish hold England responsible
for that devastation.

01:51.416 --> 01:53.125
There sits a nurse.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.125
An English nurse…

01:56.208 --> 01:57.541
[timber creaking]

01:57.625 --> 01:59.250
…traveling all on her own.

02:00.791 --> 02:03.166
And it's with her, we begin.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.916
-[music continues]
-[timber groaning]

02:09.958 --> 02:12.208
[timber creaking softly]

02:12.750 --> 02:14.750
[water dripping]

02:38.875 --> 02:40.000
[disembodied whispers]

02:41.000 --> 02:45.166
[ship bell clanging]

02:53.541 --> 02:55.541
[music continues]

03:20.750 --> 03:23.416
-[music fades out]
-[breathing heavily]

03:27.833 --> 03:29.625
[indistinct chatter]

03:37.083 --> 03:38.958
You'll be the English nurse.

03:40.708 --> 03:41.708
Will I?

03:42.458 --> 03:46.416
Well, I'm due a nun and a nurse,
and… [scoffs] …you're not the nun.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.250
[nurse] No.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.916
-[she sighs]
-Maggie!

03:54.083 --> 03:56.750
I thought I was lodging
with the girl's family,

03:56.833 --> 03:58.000
the O'Donnells.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.125
Sorry to disappoint.

04:00.208 --> 04:03.083
-No, no, I was ju--
-Sure, they'd have nowhere to put you.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.250
The O'Donnells live beyond the village.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.500
You and the nun are to lodge here.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.541
Sorry, but why a nun?

04:11.625 --> 04:13.500
-[Maggie] Welcome to Ireland.
-[nurse] Mm.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.541
-[suitcase thuds]
-[Maggie] Your room.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.416
We'll see you at eight for breakfast.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.000
[footsteps departing]

04:21.083 --> 04:22.958
[indistinct distant chatter]

04:23.625 --> 04:24.833
[sighs softly]

04:41.208 --> 04:43.958
[cutlery clinking nearby]

04:48.708 --> 04:49.708
Good morning.

04:49.791 --> 04:52.083
Have you come to do
some experiments on Anna?

04:52.666 --> 04:53.500
No.

04:54.166 --> 04:55.500
Do you know her?

04:55.583 --> 04:57.833
Everyone knows everyone here, Mrs. Wright.

04:57.916 --> 04:59.041
Ah.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.916
We shared a desk at school.

05:01.000 --> 05:01.916
Did you?

05:03.166 --> 05:06.583
[chuckles softly] You've been blessed
with many daughters, Mrs. Ryan.

05:06.666 --> 05:07.666
Only that one's mine.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.166
The other blessings
belonged to the first Mrs. Ryan.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.250
I'd call it "tricked."

05:13.583 --> 05:14.500
Mrs. Wright,

05:15.333 --> 05:16.625
the committee is waiting.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.291
[Maggie] Let her have breakfast.

05:19.375 --> 05:20.208
Please.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.750
[haunting ambient music plays]

05:23.875 --> 05:24.791
Thank you.

05:38.750 --> 05:42.375
-The watch is to last two weeks.
-It's been decided it's two weeks?

05:42.458 --> 05:45.041
-Two weeks is too long.
-It's important to be thorough.

05:45.125 --> 05:48.250
The village is overwhelmed
with sightseers and gawkers

05:48.333 --> 05:49.708
coming to stare at the child.

05:49.791 --> 05:50.750
And the newspapers.

05:50.833 --> 05:54.916
When will we stop being made a mockery of
thanks to someone's journalistic desires?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.500
-It was a medical paper.
-In a national newspaper.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.250
[Mrs. Wright] May I ask, gentlemen?

05:59.333 --> 06:02.583
No one has told me
what precisely is wrong with the girl.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.000
[Flynn] Nothing at all.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.125
Very well.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.958
I shall return to my post in England.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.125
Anna O'Donnell doesn't eat.

06:17.416 --> 06:20.625
If a patient in the hospital
refuses to eat, we use force.

06:20.708 --> 06:22.500
The girl is not to be forced.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.083
Nor interrogated or badgered.

06:25.166 --> 06:29.333
But she is also not to be denied food
should she ask for it.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.250
The girl has lived
miraculously without food

06:32.333 --> 06:33.791
since her 11th birthday.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.000
"Miraculously" is not how she's done it.

06:36.083 --> 06:39.041
The purpose of the watch is to determine

06:39.125 --> 06:43.375
exactly how Anna O'Donnell
has survived without food.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.791
So you want us to watch her?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.541
[Sir Otway] Yes.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.083
We are proposing eight-hour shifts,

06:52.166 --> 06:54.375
changing over at five in the morning,

06:54.458 --> 06:56.875
one in the afternoon, and nine at night.

06:57.791 --> 06:59.541
Does that suit you?

07:00.333 --> 07:03.333
[Flynn] There is to be no conferring
between the two of you.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.625
On the 14th day,

07:05.708 --> 07:08.958
you will each present
your separate testimony.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.833
How long exactly has it been
since the last time the girl ate?

07:16.750 --> 07:17.875
Four months.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.791
That's impossible.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.958
[unsettling music plays softly]

07:25.041 --> 07:28.333
May I ask why not two nurses,
Dr. McBrearty?

07:29.083 --> 07:32.000
Sister Michael
is the second nurse, Mrs. Wright.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.125
The O'Donnell family
drew some comfort in the idea of a nun,

07:39.916 --> 07:41.708
as did some of the less

07:41.791 --> 07:44.833
scientifically minded members
of the committee.

07:44.916 --> 07:48.375
-[unsettling music continues]
-[bell striking ominously]

07:48.458 --> 07:50.041
[Mrs. Wright panting]

07:54.791 --> 07:55.666
[sighs]

07:56.583 --> 07:59.416
[panting]

08:00.000 --> 08:01.791
And I assume she's bedridden?

08:02.791 --> 08:04.416
Better not to assume.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.625
Here we are.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.833
[unsettling somber music plays]

08:23.291 --> 08:24.541
[door lock clanks]

08:27.000 --> 08:29.541
-Dia duit.
-[Dr. McBrearty] Dia is Muire duit.

08:31.875 --> 08:33.333
-Tar isteach.
-[door creaks]

08:33.416 --> 08:35.958
[Dr. McBrearty breathing heavily]

08:38.291 --> 08:39.416
[mutters indistinctly]

08:40.875 --> 08:43.208
-Morning, Doctor.
-[Dr. McBrearty] Morning, Rosaleen.

08:43.291 --> 08:44.375
[door closes]

08:45.541 --> 08:47.416
-[Rosaleen] Hello.
-[fire crackling]

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
Hello.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.791
[water trickling]

08:54.833 --> 08:56.833
-[Rosaleen] Doctor.
-[Dr. McBrearty] Thank you.

08:56.916 --> 08:59.875
May I take your daughter's history,
Mrs. O'Donnell?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.666
Sure, what history could a child have?

09:02.750 --> 09:05.750
She hasn't eaten in four months.
Is that correct?

09:07.250 --> 09:08.708
That is correct.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.291
And would you describe her as healthy?

09:17.750 --> 09:19.791
Well, she's a little delicate, perhaps.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.416
But she never complains.

09:23.416 --> 09:26.416
-[Mrs. Wright] And her appetite?
-[Rosaleen] Never greedy.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.583
May I see the girl, please?

09:29.666 --> 09:31.750
She has visitors at the minute.

09:33.333 --> 09:34.500
[Mrs. Wright] Visitors?

09:35.583 --> 09:36.791
All the time.

09:37.541 --> 09:40.041
-From all over.
-[door opens]

09:40.125 --> 09:41.916
[Dr. McBrearty] Mr. O'Donnell.

09:42.000 --> 09:42.916
How are you?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.500
[Mr. O'Donnell] Doctor.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.125
This is Mrs. Wright.

09:50.416 --> 09:51.333
Fáilte romhat.

09:53.833 --> 09:55.458
It means, "You're welcome here."

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Thank you.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.416
[inhales deeply] Perhaps…

10:05.000 --> 10:06.666
I think the watch

10:06.750 --> 10:09.666
may be more appropriately conducted
in a hospital.

10:10.625 --> 10:11.541
[Rosaleen] No.

10:12.041 --> 10:13.916
You're not taking my wee girl away.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.333
[footsteps approaching]

10:17.416 --> 10:19.833
-Thank you.
-[Rosaleen sighs]

10:19.916 --> 10:22.875
-Thank you.
-Uh, for your trouble.

10:22.958 --> 10:25.833
-No trouble.
-Well, something for the wee lass.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.333
In the poor box, if you insist.

10:31.625 --> 10:32.875
She's a jewel.

10:35.166 --> 10:36.250
A wonder.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.541
[somber music plays]

10:42.541 --> 10:43.875
Thank you, Doctor.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.791
Thank you, Nurse Wright.

10:54.875 --> 10:58.958
[Anna whispering] …most precious cross,
adorned by the tender, delicate,

10:59.041 --> 11:01.833
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

11:01.916 --> 11:04.916
sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.166
[Mrs. Wright] Hello, Anna.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.291
Hello.

11:13.041 --> 11:16.750
My name is Elizabeth Wright.
You may call me Mrs. Wright. May I?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.125
Open, please.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
Arms up.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.333
Down.

11:49.791 --> 11:50.791
Turn around.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.041
Turn around again.

12:00.541 --> 12:02.041
And eyes wide open.

12:04.458 --> 12:07.291
[unsettling somber music plays softly]

12:22.750 --> 12:24.166
You seem well, Anna.

12:26.666 --> 12:27.750
Are you nervous at all?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.000
Why should I be nervous?

12:34.083 --> 12:35.000
Strangers…

12:36.500 --> 12:37.375
such as myself.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.416
Do you know why I'm here?

12:43.875 --> 12:45.458
To make sure I don't eat.

12:47.750 --> 12:48.958
I'm here to watch.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.416
Not prevent you from eating.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.833
Do you know the dangers
of a prolonged fast, Anna?

13:03.208 --> 13:04.708
I don't need to eat.

13:07.041 --> 13:08.250
I live on manna.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.791
From Heaven.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.125
And how does that feel?

13:20.375 --> 13:21.500
Full.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.750
Your son is not home, Mr. O'Donnell.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.708
[Rosaleen] Pat's gone over.

13:46.541 --> 13:47.625
God keep him.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.250
Have you no blessings of your own?

13:51.833 --> 13:52.750
No.

13:56.875 --> 13:57.875
Widowed.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.041
We were married for less than a year.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.833
[whispering] I adore thee,
O most precious cross,

14:14.916 --> 14:20.125
adorned by the tender, delicate,
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

14:20.208 --> 14:23.250
sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.250
Amen.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.666
-Good evening, Sister.
-Good evening.

[somber music plays]

14:59.166 --> 15:01.041
[indistinct chatter]

15:01.125 --> 15:02.208
Well?

15:03.708 --> 15:06.291
I've been summoned all the way here…

15:06.375 --> 15:09.250
-Sure, no one forced you. Another?
-[man] Aye, two more.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.833
-To offer my professional opinion--
-You can give me your professional--

15:12.916 --> 15:14.750
My professional opinion

15:14.833 --> 15:18.958
on a girl who could be somehow having food
secretly shoveled into her mouth.

15:19.041 --> 15:20.875
Well, that sounds about right.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.500
What kind of backwards village
imports a professional nurse

15:25.583 --> 15:27.208
for something like this?

15:28.791 --> 15:32.333
"Backwards village."
Didn't you nurse in the Crimea?

15:32.416 --> 15:35.625
That's exactly my point, Mr. Ryan.
This has nothing to do with nursing.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.791
You're being paid handsomely
to sit on your backside for a fortnight.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.708
-[man] I'll pay you to sit on my back--
-I'm warning you!

15:43.041 --> 15:44.791
[hushed] Prove it's nonsense, then.

15:45.541 --> 15:48.083
Prove it's nonsense, then fuck off home.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.958
[Rosaleen] I had his eyes painted on…

18:27.833 --> 18:29.000
afterwards.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.541
I misunderstood.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.125
I thought your son had emigrated.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.541
I need my children near.

18:43.666 --> 18:44.666
I'm sorry.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.208
The very best…

He takes early to be His angels.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.791
[fire crackling softly]

19:05.166 --> 19:06.458
Should we go back?

19:06.958 --> 19:07.875
No.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.041
Fresh air is good for your lungs.

19:13.291 --> 19:14.583
Those are big boots.

19:17.833 --> 19:19.208
They were my brother's.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.625
Are you hungry?

19:31.250 --> 19:32.583
Would you like some water?

19:39.541 --> 19:40.541
Thank you.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.625
-Any more?
-No, thank you.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.333
[sighs]

20:04.333 --> 20:05.333
Who's that one?

20:06.791 --> 20:08.041
St. Cecilia.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.666
She's the patron of music.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.041
She heard it playing in her heart.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.583
[Mrs. Wright chuckles, inhales]

20:19.750 --> 20:21.500
Lucky one, St. Cecilia.

20:22.791 --> 20:25.333
-[Anna] St. Lucy.
-[Mrs. Wright sighs softly]

20:25.416 --> 20:28.000
[Anna] Patron of the blind
and protector of sight.

20:29.958 --> 20:33.416
-St. Agnes, chastity and purity.
-[cards shuffle]

20:34.958 --> 20:36.125
Who's your favorite?

20:38.083 --> 20:38.916
Here, look.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.833
The mystic marriage
of St. Catherine and the baby Jesus.

20:43.541 --> 20:47.541
He gave her a wedding ring,
but only she could see it.º

20:53.583 --> 20:55.083
Anyone can be chosen.

20:56.166 --> 20:57.583
Saints or sinners.

20:59.458 --> 21:00.916
[card shuffles]

21:01.000 --> 21:02.333
Elizabeth of Hungary.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.125
She was a widow.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.208
Ah…

21:06.958 --> 21:08.625
The very worst of sins.

21:12.208 --> 21:13.375
[card thumps softly]

21:13.458 --> 21:15.458
No, not at all.

21:16.458 --> 21:17.916
That's not what I meant.

21:19.666 --> 21:20.583
I know.

21:26.083 --> 21:29.833
Does your family call you… Elizabeth?

21:31.416 --> 21:32.583
Or Eliza?

21:33.583 --> 21:34.958
Or maybe Betty?

21:37.458 --> 21:39.000
They don't call me anything.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.500
I don't have a family anymore.

21:44.875 --> 21:45.958
[softly] I'm sorry.

21:49.291 --> 21:53.208
Doesn't look like a child
who's not eaten in four months, does she?

21:53.791 --> 21:54.833
[Rosaleen] Indeed.

21:55.750 --> 21:59.500
How strongly the vital force burns.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.958
[priest] Are you feeling well
in yourself, Anna?

22:02.875 --> 22:05.375
Very well, Father, thank you.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.625
[chuckles softly] Good girl.

22:08.666 --> 22:10.000
[photographer] Hold still.

22:13.791 --> 22:14.791
One,

22:15.541 --> 22:16.541
two,

22:17.416 --> 22:18.416
three,

22:19.083 --> 22:19.916
four…

22:20.000 --> 22:24.708
What if Anna is drawing
on some nutritive force

22:24.791 --> 22:26.875
we don't yet understand?

22:26.958 --> 22:28.250
Such as?

22:28.333 --> 22:31.458
Well… magnetism, perhaps?

22:32.708 --> 22:34.791
Molecules of scent?

22:34.875 --> 22:39.000
-Anna is bothered by visitors constantly.
-[Dr. McBrearty grumbles]

22:39.083 --> 22:42.416
For a serious study,
we need quiet and isolation, Doctor.

22:43.916 --> 22:44.916
Doctor.

22:53.416 --> 22:56.041
[footsteps approaching]

22:59.625 --> 23:02.541
Are you eating for the patient
as well as yourself? [sighs]

23:04.541 --> 23:05.375
[he sighs]

23:08.000 --> 23:09.541
[spoon clinks]

23:09.625 --> 23:11.083
That was rude.

23:11.958 --> 23:12.958
I'm sorry.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.375
Will Byrne, Daily Telegraph.

23:17.750 --> 23:18.916
Over from London.

23:20.875 --> 23:21.875
Like you.

23:23.708 --> 23:26.041
I was hoping for an interview
with the miracle girl herself.

23:26.125 --> 23:27.666
She is not taking visitors.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.666
Doctor's orders.

23:31.583 --> 23:33.000
And who gives him his?

23:34.333 --> 23:37.333
He started this whole thing off,
the good doctor.

23:38.666 --> 23:41.291
-I'm writing a big piece about the girl.
-[Mrs. Wright scoffs]

23:43.458 --> 23:45.708
-[Will] Just doing my job.
-[Mrs. Wright] Hmm.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.250
And I, mine.

23:50.666 --> 23:54.041
Perhaps I could interview you instead?

23:54.708 --> 23:57.291
The Nightingale
who's come to watch over her.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.000
I would never speak about a patient.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.541
And certainly not to a journalist.

24:03.625 --> 24:07.208
I'll have you know, I've written
for dozens of publications, all over.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.250
So you'd write anything for a shilling.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.291
[Will inhales deeply]

24:18.916 --> 24:22.791
What else has brought you across the sea
to play jailer to a child?

24:29.750 --> 24:30.750
Kitty.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.541
What was the last thing Anna ate?

24:35.250 --> 24:36.250
Do you remember?

24:37.083 --> 24:38.500
The flesh of our Savior.

24:40.458 --> 24:44.125
Her birthday and her Holy Communion
were on the same day.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.291
It was a blessed day.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.625
So just water and wheat?

24:52.125 --> 24:54.416
No, missus,
not just water and wheat. [sighs]

24:54.500 --> 24:56.666
It's the body and blood of Christ.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.000
That's a story, Kitty.
I'm looking for facts.

25:03.833 --> 25:04.833
I'm sorry.

25:05.875 --> 25:06.875
I didn't…

25:10.041 --> 25:11.291
It's what I'm here for.

25:12.375 --> 25:15.750
-To tell the difference between--
-I dig up turf, and you dig up the truth.

25:19.541 --> 25:20.666
That's exactly right.

25:23.791 --> 25:25.916
You see, you also need your stories.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.666
You write them down
in that little notebook of yours.

25:28.750 --> 25:29.750
Thank you.

25:32.666 --> 25:34.666
It's quite the bible you got going.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.625
[footsteps departing]

25:36.708 --> 25:39.166
[eerie ambient music plays]

25:41.625 --> 25:47.416
[Mrs. Wright] Hello again,
I told you we are nothing without stories.

25:49.791 --> 25:51.833
[Sister Michael]
Father Thaddeus dropped it by.

25:53.416 --> 25:56.125
-He said you'd asked for a lamp.
-[nearby indistinct chatter]

25:56.916 --> 25:58.541
-I did.
-[Rosaleen] Amen.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.791
Candlelight is not half bright enough
for a watch.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.458
[Rosaleen] Sweet dreams, pet.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.708
[Mrs. Wright] And it's important
we stay alert, Sister.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.958
-It runs on burning fluid.
-[Mr. O'Donnell] Sleep sound.

26:09.041 --> 26:11.666
-[Anna] Good night.
-And you have to keep the wick trimmed.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.625
-[Anna] Night, Mammy.
-I'm sure I'll manage.

26:13.708 --> 26:14.958
[footsteps departing]

26:15.041 --> 26:17.458
-[Kitty] Oíche mhaith, Anna.
-Good night, Kitty.

26:20.125 --> 26:22.166
Will you be able to sleep
with the light on, Anna?

26:22.250 --> 26:24.125
Yes, thank you, Miss…

26:25.375 --> 26:26.416
Betsy?

26:27.791 --> 26:29.875
It's Nurse Wright to you, missy.

26:31.541 --> 26:33.750
-Anything?
-We're not to confer.

26:34.416 --> 26:35.541
Good night, Anna.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.416
Night, Sister.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.416
[Mrs. Wright inhales deeply]

26:57.500 --> 26:59.000

[whispering] …sprinkled
and stained with his precious blood.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.166
Amen.

28:34.416 --> 28:36.083
[Mrs. Wright] Good morning, Anna.

28:37.875 --> 28:38.875
Good morning…

28:41.416 --> 28:42.333
Lily?

28:43.666 --> 28:47.083
[Mrs. Wright] If you make up names for me,
I'm gonna have to do the same for you.

28:50.791 --> 28:51.958
Good morning…

28:53.000 --> 28:53.833
Lizzie?

28:58.750 --> 29:00.291
Should I call you Annie?

29:04.500 --> 29:05.500
Or Annabelle?

29:06.416 --> 29:07.500
Hannah, perhaps?

29:09.708 --> 29:12.041
But then I'd be someone else,

29:12.125 --> 29:13.125
not me.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.500
Nancy.

29:17.791 --> 29:18.916
Or Nan.

29:20.750 --> 29:23.000
Nan. I like Nan.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.666
Well, Nan…

29:29.750 --> 29:31.458
I owe you an apology.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.958
-Last night…
-[statuette clatters]

29:37.416 --> 29:40.083
I knocked over one of your treasures,
and I'm sorry.

29:57.166 --> 29:58.250
[clatter]

29:59.875 --> 30:01.791
Is the lock of hair your brother's?

30:05.791 --> 30:07.458
-[hair rustles]
-[clatter]

30:08.416 --> 30:09.583
You must miss him.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.458
I know your mother misses him terribly.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.000
Sorrow is God's spade.

30:23.916 --> 30:25.000
What does that mean?

30:26.916 --> 30:28.416
It readies the ground.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.833
[whispers] Can I tell you something?

30:37.416 --> 30:39.208
My mother used to call me Lib.

30:42.791 --> 30:44.458
-[softly] Lib.
-Mm-hmm.

30:45.458 --> 30:46.458
Mrs. Lib.

[Anna, whispers] Hail Mary,
full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.958
-Blessed art thou amongst women…
-[Lib] Have you seen anything?

32:45.916 --> 32:49.333
-[whispers] There's been nothing to see.
-[Anna whispering]

32:49.416 --> 32:51.000

[softly] Morning, sweetheart.

[Mr. O'Donnell, whispers]
Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom…

33:12.958 --> 33:13.958
Mrs. Lib?

33:14.833 --> 33:15.833
Yes?

33:16.750 --> 33:18.375
Is it true you went to war?

33:22.083 --> 33:24.958
Yes. Turn around. Sit down, please.

33:27.708 --> 33:28.958
What was it like?

33:31.875 --> 33:34.041
It was difficult.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.541
I was tending to soldiers.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.166
Men who'd seen awful things.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.708
Who'd done awful things.

33:49.750 --> 33:51.500
[softly] Were they very sick?

33:54.083 --> 33:55.625
Some of them were, yes.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.458
But…

34:04.000 --> 34:05.375
it's a great privilege…

34:07.166 --> 34:09.458
being with people at the end.

34:11.833 --> 34:12.833
They talk.

34:15.666 --> 34:17.166
They tell their stories.

34:17.958 --> 34:18.958
Open.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.958
The souls in Purgatory
have to be burned for a while,

34:31.791 --> 34:32.916
to clean them.

34:34.208 --> 34:37.500
[softly] But the souls in Hell
have to be burned forever.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.500
Surely your brother's in Heaven, Anna?

34:46.625 --> 34:48.750
[hushed] We can't know that, Mrs. Lib.

35:33.458 --> 35:36.458
[Lib] I'd assumed you'd be
on your way back to London by now.

35:36.541 --> 35:37.541
If only.

35:38.958 --> 35:43.333
My editor demands daily dispatches
on this matter of international import.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
All I can currently supply
is satirical speculation.

35:47.708 --> 35:49.541
I must beg for your help again.

35:50.166 --> 35:51.166
Ask the nun.

35:52.083 --> 35:57.000
If she sees me, she'll take the rod to me.
I've sinned too much. It shows.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It would make a good story though.

36:01.541 --> 36:03.250
Are they making money out of her?

36:04.125 --> 36:05.625
Straight in the poor box.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.791
Money for the Church, then.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.708
Not enough to be worth this much effort.

36:11.541 --> 36:13.500
The doctor? Making his name?

36:13.583 --> 36:16.875
No. He admires her "vital force."

36:18.000 --> 36:22.625
What about Flynn? He owns their house
and is the most fervent of them all.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.833
He's obsessed
with her being a miracle child.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.458
He's never there, if that's what you mean.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.083
Is it all the girl's doing?

36:33.875 --> 36:37.208
I've watched her until my eyes burn.

36:37.291 --> 36:40.416
These days,
nothing but water has passed her lips.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.416
She's an actress.

[Rosaleen, whispering]
God bless the bed that I lay on.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.666
As I lay down my head to sleep,
I pray to God my soul to keep.

37:37.583 --> 37:42.125
If I should die before I wake,
I pray to God my soul to take.

37:42.791 --> 37:47.583
Wake me now, wake me never.
My soul… [whispering indistinctly]

37:47.666 --> 37:50.000
From this point on,
no one can come near her.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.875
Save for myself and Sister Michael,
no one can touch her.

37:52.958 --> 37:55.166
-I must ask you to leave.
-You can't do that.

37:55.250 --> 37:57.500
Stand up. It's a requirement of the watch.
Please leave.

-[sobs] Please, please, please.
-Open your mouth. It will hurt otherwise.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.708
-Open your mouth, Anna.
-No. No. No, no.

57:10.791 --> 57:12.583
Anna, please. Anna, down!

57:12.666 --> 57:16.083
-[Anna breathing agitatedly]
-[Lib] Open. Open.

57:16.583 --> 57:18.125
[hushed] Anna, open!

57:19.416 --> 57:20.333
[softly] Open.

57:20.916 --> 57:24.541
[Anna gagging]

57:32.708 --> 57:35.000
[gagging] Stop.

57:35.083 --> 57:37.750
-[Lib breathing shakily]
-[Anna gagging]

57:42.541 --> 57:44.875
-[gasps, coughs]
-[Lib, softly] I'm sorry.

57:44.958 --> 57:47.250
[crying]

57:47.833 --> 57:48.958
[softly] Forgive me.

57:49.041 --> 57:50.916
[both breathing heavily]

57:51.000 --> 57:52.166
[Anna coughs]

57:52.250 --> 57:54.791
-[sobbing]
-[Lib breathing heavily]

57:54.875 --> 57:56.041
[Rosaleen] Anna?

57:56.125 --> 57:58.583
-[Anna whimpers softly]
-[Rosaleen] Is everything all right?

57:59.833 --> 58:02.000
[Lib breathing heavily]

58:03.375 --> 58:04.666
Everything's fine.

58:08.458 --> 58:09.666
[breathes faintly]

58:11.208 --> 58:12.541
[groans softly, sighs]

58:14.083 --> 58:15.041
[groans softly]

58:15.625 --> 58:18.333
[breathing heavily]

58:18.416 --> 58:19.750
Are you all right?

58:19.833 --> 58:20.833
[mutters faintly]

58:22.291 --> 58:24.166
-I think we should go back.
-No.

58:26.041 --> 58:28.750
-I want to show you something.
-Another time, Anna. Come on.

58:28.833 --> 58:29.875
Not you.

58:34.083 --> 58:35.291
You.

58:39.916 --> 58:41.583
[Lib] Be ca-- Be careful, Anna.

58:46.500 --> 58:48.041
[Anna pants softly]

58:49.750 --> 58:51.666
-[Will] The Holy Well.
-[Anna grunts softly]

58:53.250 --> 58:55.166
We used to come here when we were…

58:58.000 --> 58:59.666
"Turn the pebbles in the…"

59:01.416 --> 59:02.250
"Bullaun."

59:03.250 --> 59:04.166
[Will] Bullaun.

59:07.625 --> 59:10.958
"Rub a clootie on what hurts,
and tie it to the May tree."

59:13.458 --> 59:14.625
[Anna, softly] Yes.

59:15.875 --> 59:17.916
"By the time it rots away,

59:19.208 --> 59:20.791
your hurt will be gone."

59:22.291 --> 59:23.250
[Will] Hmm.

59:26.666 --> 59:28.458
[softly] I've submitted my article.

59:29.458 --> 59:30.625
"Murder by Degrees."

59:31.125 --> 59:33.500
You have to try
with the other committee men.

59:34.458 --> 59:36.583
-[whispers] She's going to die.
-Stop it.

59:42.333 --> 59:43.291
Anna?

59:46.958 --> 59:47.875
Anna?

59:50.333 --> 59:52.208
Anna, I'm here. I'm here.

59:53.625 --> 59:57.125
[Lib panting]

59:57.208 --> 59:58.125
[Will sighs]

59:59.666 --> 1:00:03.333
Give her to me. Give her to me.
You can't take her in. Come on, Anna.

1:00:03.416 --> 1:00:05.250
-This has to end, Lib.
-Come on.

1:00:07.166 --> 1:00:09.583
[anxious ambient music plays]

1:00:11.375 --> 1:00:12.375
[Kitty] Anna?!

1:00:21.250 --> 1:00:23.833
[Lib] Here she is.
Here she is. Here she is.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:29.541
[weakly] It's just a faint, Mammy.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.875
-Is there…
-[Anna wheezes faintly]

1:00:33.958 --> 1:00:37.625
-[soft labored breathing]
-Is there anything I can get you?

1:00:41.916 --> 1:00:42.958
Nothin'?

1:00:45.666 --> 1:00:47.916
Nothin' at all, Anna?

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.166
[breath quivers]

1:00:51.583 --> 1:00:53.666
[softly] Just a little sleep, Mammy.

1:00:56.416 --> 1:00:58.250
And then, I'll awake.

1:00:58.333 --> 1:01:00.416
[breathing faintly]

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:02.833
Then you'll wake.

1:01:04.041 --> 1:01:05.375
[Anna breathing faintly]

1:01:05.458 --> 1:01:08.416
[dreary foreboding music plays]

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:20.666
[music fades out]

1:01:21.666 --> 1:01:22.833
How is she?

1:01:34.375 --> 1:01:36.875
[Lib breathing heavily]

1:01:36.958 --> 1:01:39.375
[Kitty] "Little A-Anna O'Donnell…

the last s-surviving child

1:01:54.750 --> 1:01:57.958
-Best teacher I could have.
-[Lib] Why is she in that chair?

1:01:58.666 --> 1:02:00.291
Dr. McBrearty brought it.

1:02:00.875 --> 1:02:02.708
Borrowed it from Sir Otway.

1:02:03.458 --> 1:02:05.458
Just till Anna's back on her feet.

1:02:13.083 --> 1:02:14.458
Lean forward, please, Anna.

1:02:31.916 --> 1:02:33.041
Breathe in.

-[Lib] Sit up. Up.
-[hacking coughing]

1:03:55.166 --> 1:03:57.625
Squeeze my arm. Squeeze it.

[choking coughing]

1:04:04.583 --> 1:04:05.833

1:05:08.250 --> 1:05:11.000

-[Sister Michael] You're a little early.

1:05:39.083 --> 1:05:40.416
"Manna from Heaven."

1:05:42.791 --> 1:05:44.250
You lived off manna from Heaven.

1:05:48.541 --> 1:05:50.833
[breathing heavily]

1:05:50.916 --> 1:05:52.708
"A mother's kiss is sacred."

1:05:56.625 --> 1:05:58.666
You don't understand us.

1:06:01.333 --> 1:06:02.625
I don't, but…

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:04.625
[breathing heavily]

1:06:04.708 --> 1:06:06.500
I do understand

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:09.000
that your mother spat chewed-up food…

1:06:09.083 --> 1:06:10.291
Manna from Heaven.

1:06:10.375 --> 1:06:12.291
-[Lib] …from her mouth…
-From God.

1:06:12.375 --> 1:06:14.625
-[Lib] …in order to sustain you.
-Manna.

1:06:15.833 --> 1:06:17.833
Food, Anna.

1:06:17.916 --> 1:06:18.875
Food.

1:06:23.750 --> 1:06:25.708
'Twas a holy secret.

1:06:26.791 --> 1:06:28.041
A mystery.

1:06:29.458 --> 1:06:30.375
[Lib] Anna…

1:06:31.458 --> 1:06:32.916
Anna, I have to tell.

1:06:34.458 --> 1:06:35.625
I have to.

1:06:36.375 --> 1:06:38.916
It's what I'm here for,
to find out the truth.

1:06:41.208 --> 1:06:42.416
Then eat.

1:06:46.291 --> 1:06:48.875
[breathing agitatedly]

1:06:50.666 --> 1:06:52.583
What if your mother could kiss you again?

1:06:53.666 --> 1:06:54.666
What if…

1:06:56.541 --> 1:06:57.833
What if God

1:06:59.125 --> 1:07:02.208
could provide manna again?

1:07:07.166 --> 1:07:08.916
Why won't you eat, Anna?

1:07:10.083 --> 1:07:11.291
[softly] I adore thee…

1:07:13.458 --> 1:07:15.458
O most precious cross…

1:07:16.791 --> 1:07:19.750
adorned by the tender,

1:07:20.458 --> 1:07:23.833
delicate, and venerable members…

1:07:27.250 --> 1:07:28.333
[Lib] Your prayer.

1:07:31.958 --> 1:07:33.708
Thirty-three times.

1:07:36.333 --> 1:07:38.333
[sobs] Whilst fasting.

1:07:39.708 --> 1:07:42.000
[Lib] But to what end, Anna? What for?

1:07:43.333 --> 1:07:46.250
One soul will be released.

1:07:49.333 --> 1:07:50.291
Released?

1:07:50.875 --> 1:07:52.083
[Anna] From Hell.

1:07:56.041 --> 1:07:57.000
Your brother?

1:08:01.541 --> 1:08:04.625
[quivering] H-- He must be so close now.

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:07.208
[sobs]

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:09.333
[Lib] Anna,

1:08:09.958 --> 1:08:12.833
fasting means skipping one meal,
not all of them.

1:08:15.125 --> 1:08:16.458
That's to atone.

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.875
[breath quivering]

1:08:23.958 --> 1:08:26.583
I have to save him

1:08:26.666 --> 1:08:28.875
from all of the burning.

1:08:30.708 --> 1:08:31.875
[sobs]

1:08:31.958 --> 1:08:34.833
He is burning all the time.

1:08:34.916 --> 1:08:37.458
-[Lib] No.
-No, Mrs. Lib.

1:08:37.958 --> 1:08:40.375
That's what hell is.

1:08:40.458 --> 1:08:42.375
-[Lib] No.
-It's ceaseless.

1:08:42.458 --> 1:08:45.208
-Anna, he was just a boy.
-[Anna sobbing]

1:08:46.375 --> 1:08:49.000
He was just a child.
Why would he be burning?

1:08:54.166 --> 1:08:55.375
What did he do?

1:09:02.541 --> 1:09:04.041
He said it was double.

1:09:08.458 --> 1:09:09.458
[Lib] Double?

1:09:12.916 --> 1:09:14.166
Double love.

1:09:17.875 --> 1:09:19.041
A sister…

1:09:21.416 --> 1:09:22.583
and a wife.

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.000
And I…

1:09:28.083 --> 1:09:29.291
[breath quivers]

1:09:38.916 --> 1:09:39.958
How old were you?

1:09:43.666 --> 1:09:45.125
[sobs]

1:09:45.208 --> 1:09:46.208
Nine.

1:09:48.583 --> 1:09:50.583
[breath quivering]

1:09:53.625 --> 1:09:54.791
Just the once?

1:10:02.291 --> 1:10:03.791
[softly] Love is forever.

1:10:06.666 --> 1:10:09.000
He told me like it was a story.

1:10:11.041 --> 1:10:13.041
We married in the night.

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:18.583
[sobbing softly]

1:10:18.666 --> 1:10:20.166
And then he got sick.

1:10:22.125 --> 1:10:23.291
[sobs] It--

1:10:23.375 --> 1:10:26.416
[crying] It wasn't holy.
He was being punished.

1:10:30.666 --> 1:10:31.708
And…

1:10:31.791 --> 1:10:33.083
[sobs]

1:10:33.166 --> 1:10:34.625
And Mammy said…

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:37.875
[breath quivering]

1:10:37.958 --> 1:10:41.250
-That it was my fault he'd been taken.
-No.

1:10:42.041 --> 1:10:44.791
-No. That is not true.
-[Anna crying]

1:10:46.375 --> 1:10:48.666
-[sniffles]
-That is not true, Anna.

1:10:49.583 --> 1:10:50.583
No.

1:10:52.708 --> 1:10:53.625
[sniffles]

1:10:55.041 --> 1:10:56.250
[inhales shakily]

1:10:57.333 --> 1:10:58.833
I loved him back.

1:11:02.833 --> 1:11:04.166
[sobbing]

1:11:11.250 --> 1:11:14.333
[tense percussive music plays]

1:11:19.375 --> 1:11:21.125
[bell gongs]

1:11:21.208 --> 1:11:23.208
[wind gusting]

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:25.291
[tense music continues]

1:11:26.875 --> 1:11:28.875
[bell gongs]

1:11:34.375 --> 1:11:35.583
[bell gongs]

1:11:35.666 --> 1:11:37.666
[tense music continues]

1:11:41.833 --> 1:11:43.833
[bell gongs]

1:11:49.458 --> 1:11:51.458
[bell gongs]

1:11:56.875 --> 1:11:58.875
[bell gongs]

1:12:02.416 --> 1:12:04.250
[tense music swells]

1:12:04.333 --> 1:12:06.333
[bell gongs]

1:12:12.791 --> 1:12:15.291
[music intensifying, fades out]

1:12:15.375 --> 1:12:20.458
You have urgent information
pertaining to the watch, Mrs. Wright?

1:12:21.416 --> 1:12:22.333
[Lib] I do.

1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:24.750
[Dr. McBrearty] Go ahead.

1:12:26.666 --> 1:12:28.166
Anna O'Donnell is dying.

1:12:29.208 --> 1:12:32.375
-[Dr. McBrearty] Mrs. Wright--
-She can barely stand up.

1:12:32.458 --> 1:12:33.875
She can barely move.

1:12:34.708 --> 1:12:37.916
She's feverish,
and her pulse rate quickens by the hour.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.250
If you have medical concerns
about the patient,

1:12:42.208 --> 1:12:45.708
may I ask you come to me,
rather than summoning everybody--

1:12:45.791 --> 1:12:48.708
Our watch, sir, has thwarted
the one thing that has kept her alive

1:12:48.791 --> 1:12:50.041
for the past four months.

1:12:52.958 --> 1:12:53.875
Go on.

1:13:00.208 --> 1:13:02.208
Anna's mother, Mrs. O'Donnell,

1:13:03.291 --> 1:13:05.791
has been passing her food
from her own mouth.

1:13:07.416 --> 1:13:10.791
She cups her face and kisses her
good morning and good night,

1:13:10.875 --> 1:13:13.208
and she feeds her daughter with each kiss.

1:13:14.541 --> 1:13:15.625
Like a bird.

1:13:17.291 --> 1:13:21.166
Now that you have the answer,
I am begging you, you must stop the watch

1:13:21.250 --> 1:13:24.125
and make every effort
in keeping this girl from dying.

1:13:26.291 --> 1:13:27.291
[Flynn] Lies.

1:13:29.375 --> 1:13:30.625
I am not lying.

1:13:31.958 --> 1:13:36.708
It was a mistake,
a terrible mistake, to bring a nurse here.

1:13:37.333 --> 1:13:38.625
An English nurse.

1:13:38.708 --> 1:13:40.791
What reason would I have to lie?

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:44.250
"Murder by Degrees," Mrs. Wright.

1:13:44.333 --> 1:13:46.916
Take that up with the journalist.
She did not write that.

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.333
Well, how else did he catch a glimpse
of the fasting girl?

1:13:50.416 --> 1:13:52.875
Perhaps you should interrogate Mr. Byrne
rather than me.

1:13:52.958 --> 1:13:56.916
Stopped that little girl
from seeing her own mother and father.

1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.333
-But handed her over to some journalist.
-I have only done as you have asked of me.

1:14:02.875 --> 1:14:04.083
Sister Michael,

1:14:05.250 --> 1:14:08.625
have you observed this practice
between mother and child?

1:14:13.708 --> 1:14:14.708
I…

1:14:15.750 --> 1:14:17.666
have not, Sir Otway.

1:14:17.750 --> 1:14:20.208
-[Flynn] There. Lies!
-I'm not lying.

1:14:20.291 --> 1:14:22.708
-[Flynn] She's making it all up.
-I am not lying.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:25.583
-[Flynn] She should not have come here.
-I am telling you the truth.

1:14:27.958 --> 1:14:31.416
Perhaps we might ask Anna herself.

1:14:38.166 --> 1:14:39.083
Very well.

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.291
Bring the child in.

1:14:48.875 --> 1:14:50.333
[Sister Michael] Come through.

1:14:50.416 --> 1:14:53.500
[footsteps approaching slowly]

1:14:56.250 --> 1:14:58.875
[wheelchair clattering]

1:15:12.916 --> 1:15:14.166
There she is.

1:15:18.166 --> 1:15:19.125
Anna…

1:15:20.916 --> 1:15:25.875
Mrs. Wright has shared something with us

1:15:25.958 --> 1:15:27.916
that she has observed

1:15:29.083 --> 1:15:31.750
between you and your mother.

1:15:34.750 --> 1:15:38.541
Does your mother feed you, Anna?

1:15:39.625 --> 1:15:40.791
Pass food…

1:15:42.333 --> 1:15:44.041
from her mouth to yours?

1:15:52.625 --> 1:15:57.166
Let me ask
a little more plainly, if I may.

1:15:58.583 --> 1:16:01.333
Have you eaten anything

1:16:02.250 --> 1:16:04.458
in the past four months, Anna?

1:16:14.916 --> 1:16:16.250
Manna from Heaven.

1:16:18.500 --> 1:16:19.833
That is all.

1:16:20.541 --> 1:16:21.958
[Flynn] Well done, Anna.

1:16:24.166 --> 1:16:27.916
[Sir Otway] You will carry on
with the watch as planned, Mrs. Wright.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.750
-[Mr. Ryan] Fools.
-[Sir Otway] The watch will continue.

1:16:30.833 --> 1:16:33.625
[Mr. Ryan] She just told us.
She found the reason.

1:16:33.708 --> 1:16:36.041
[Dr. McBrearty]
We all agreed to the watch,

1:16:36.791 --> 1:16:38.375
and we shall see it through.

1:16:41.583 --> 1:16:43.500
I will nurse her until she dies.

1:16:46.791 --> 1:16:48.833
As I have done many times before.

1:16:50.916 --> 1:16:52.416
I have nothing more to say.

1:16:56.041 --> 1:16:59.416
I'll be offering a solemn Mass for you
tomorrow night.

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:03.291
To pray for strength and hope

1:17:03.875 --> 1:17:06.208
and for your recovery, Anna.

1:17:06.291 --> 1:17:07.708
Thank you, Father.

-[Anna breathes heavily]

1:18:06.583 --> 1:18:08.166
Good girl. All done.

1:18:08.250 --> 1:18:10.833
-[Anna grunting softly]
-All done.

1:18:10.916 --> 1:18:12.750
[shallow labored breathing]

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:14.375
Lie back. Go on.

1:18:15.125 --> 1:18:16.625
There you go.

1:18:16.708 --> 1:18:18.583
-[whispers] Close your eyes.
-[Anna grunts]

1:18:24.125 --> 1:18:25.375
[softly] She's dying.

1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:31.666
She's chosen.

1:18:32.250 --> 1:18:34.750
She's not chosen. She's a child.

1:18:36.083 --> 1:18:37.958
-You don't know us.
-[Lib] Wait.

1:18:44.291 --> 1:18:46.333
I'm sure that's true in many ways.

1:18:49.166 --> 1:18:52.458
And I'm sure there's much about your life
that I don't understand.

1:18:55.791 --> 1:18:57.291
But I do know grief

1:18:58.625 --> 1:18:59.791
and loss.

1:19:02.625 --> 1:19:05.541
And the pain of losing a child
is something I do know.

1:19:09.083 --> 1:19:10.083
[softly] I didn't…

1:19:11.375 --> 1:19:14.750
[voice breaking] Abandoning Anna to die
when you could have prevented it

1:19:14.833 --> 1:19:16.333
is a terrible thing.

1:19:22.750 --> 1:19:24.750
[softly] This is for her salvation.

1:19:29.833 --> 1:19:32.083
[whispers] Perhaps you could
kiss her good night again?

1:19:33.250 --> 1:19:36.041
-[Rosaleen breathes agitatedly]
-Or good morning.

1:19:37.333 --> 1:19:40.958
-Or goodbye--
-This life is so short, Mrs. Wright.

The next is for eternity.

-Ugh!

-That's insanity, Lib!
-Fine. Don't help. That's fine.

1:20:50.625 --> 1:20:54.375
-You can't take a child from its family.
-They don't want her!

1:20:54.458 --> 1:20:57.583
You've fundamentally misunderstood
these people, my people.

1:20:57.666 --> 1:20:58.666
That man loves her.

1:20:58.750 --> 1:21:03.666
Love requires some action,
some intervention, at some point.

1:21:03.750 --> 1:21:07.916
-Not just standing by--
-His faith, his prayer, is his action.

1:21:08.666 --> 1:21:11.208
-You don't understand--
-Perhaps. Yes, perhaps.

1:21:11.291 --> 1:21:14.500
But this isn't some philosophical point
that we can debate.

1:21:15.666 --> 1:21:18.500
This is a child's life,
and they are killing her.

1:21:20.125 --> 1:21:22.750
You wrote so yourself.
Or were you just lying?

1:21:22.833 --> 1:21:24.875
-Her mother and father--
-Have failed her.

1:21:24.958 --> 1:21:27.125
-[Will] That's not--
-Will you help me?

This is my last chance to help her.

for each of us.

1:21:47.250 --> 1:21:48.458

to fall in love with me.

I'm asking you to help and maybe…

1:21:56.416 --> 1:21:59.708
maybe live a different way
and find contentment in a different place.

1:21:59.791 --> 1:22:00.791
No.

But if you don't want to,
can you just get us as far as Dublin?

Please. That's all. Nothing else.

It's not a small thing
you're asking of me.

1:22:33.916 --> 1:22:36.250
It's kidnapping, Lib. We'd end up in jail.

for the lives of your family?

1:33:27.958 --> 1:33:29.958
My dress must have knocked it over.

1:33:33.375 --> 1:33:34.666
You were hired to watch her,

1:33:34.750 --> 1:33:37.000
and all you left us with
was a pile of ash.

1:33:37.083 --> 1:33:39.833
Not her bones even?
How hard have they tried?

1:33:40.416 --> 1:33:43.291
Difficulties compounded by heavy rain.

1:33:43.375 --> 1:33:46.166
-[Mr. Ryan] Unbelievable.
-The ruins will become a shrine.

1:33:46.250 --> 1:33:48.041
[Mr. Ryan] Oh,
stop with your nonsense, Flynn.

1:33:48.125 --> 1:33:49.625
If there was a body to be cut open,

1:33:49.708 --> 1:33:52.125
you'd have found a hungry child
starved to death.

1:33:52.208 --> 1:33:55.208
[Flynn] Nothing but holiness
would you have found there.

1:33:55.291 --> 1:33:58.208
Our first saint since the Dark Ages.

1:33:58.291 --> 1:34:03.708
-[Mr. Ryan] Father, for goodness' sake.
-Nothing has been proven, Flynn.

1:34:03.791 --> 1:34:04.750
That is true.

1:34:04.833 --> 1:34:09.291
Because this woman has destroyed
any evidence of a miracle

1:34:09.375 --> 1:34:10.958
by burning down the house.

1:34:11.041 --> 1:34:14.041
-[Mr. Ryan] Jesus Christ.
-[Sir Otway] Is that an accusation?

1:34:14.125 --> 1:34:15.875
[Flynn] Of course it's an accusation.

1:34:15.958 --> 1:34:18.541
-This is a matter for the police.
-[Father Thaddeus] Enough.

1:34:20.625 --> 1:34:23.583
The most pressing question,

1:34:24.375 --> 1:34:26.250
a-- as I see it,

1:34:26.333 --> 1:34:32.458
is how much liability
could be attached to a nurse

1:34:32.541 --> 1:34:35.500
acting in the capacity of a servant

1:34:36.708 --> 1:34:38.041
to this committee?

1:34:48.125 --> 1:34:49.791
You will remain here

1:34:50.541 --> 1:34:54.125
until the head constable says you may go.

1:34:55.041 --> 1:34:57.166
And it goes without saying

1:34:57.833 --> 1:35:00.708
that you won't receive your payment.

1:35:24.166 --> 1:35:25.666
[Sister Michael] Does it hurt?

1:35:27.791 --> 1:35:28.833
[Lib] Mm.

1:35:31.375 --> 1:35:32.375
Awful.

1:35:33.916 --> 1:35:36.166
That they allowed it to go on for so long.

1:35:37.083 --> 1:35:38.875
That a little girl should die.

1:35:42.250 --> 1:35:43.250
These men…

1:35:50.416 --> 1:35:53.000
[footsteps departing]

1:35:53.083 --> 1:35:55.083
[bandages rustle softly]

1:36:00.916 --> 1:36:01.916
Can I…

1:36:04.541 --> 1:36:05.916
Can I ask you something?

1:36:10.416 --> 1:36:11.375
Mm-hmm.

1:36:12.458 --> 1:36:14.375
Before I found you last night…

1:36:17.916 --> 1:36:19.875
I believe I was granted…

1:36:21.208 --> 1:36:22.125
a vision.

1:36:25.625 --> 1:36:29.250
I was too uneasy
to stay to the end of Mass, you see.

1:36:32.750 --> 1:36:34.500
And on my way to the house,

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.083
I saw…

1:36:40.125 --> 1:36:41.333
an angel

1:36:42.875 --> 1:36:44.291
on horseback,

1:36:44.875 --> 1:36:47.041
riding away with Anna.

1:37:05.750 --> 1:37:07.875
[whispers] Has she gone to a better place?

1:37:08.791 --> 1:37:10.333
Can you promise me that?

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.416
[soft lugubrious music plays]

1:37:18.750 --> 1:37:19.750
[softly] I promise.

1:37:22.750 --> 1:37:27.500
"So, f-for lack of a body,

1:37:29.416 --> 1:37:33.208
the famous fasting girl

1:37:33.291 --> 1:37:37.291
has been declared dead…

1:37:38.625 --> 1:37:40.125
in absentia."

1:37:40.208 --> 1:37:42.208
[music continues]

1:37:43.625 --> 1:37:45.416
"There is no one to blame."

1:37:47.041 --> 1:37:51.750
"No… blame… is ascribed

1:37:52.625 --> 1:37:56.041
to the father… and mother

1:37:56.125 --> 1:37:59.291
who… let the child…

1:38:01.416 --> 1:38:02.875
waste away."

1:38:05.291 --> 1:38:07.833
[proficiently] "Nor are any charges

1:38:08.833 --> 1:38:11.583
to be laid against the aged physician

1:38:12.708 --> 1:38:14.291
who deluded himself

1:38:15.083 --> 1:38:17.958
that he had discovered
the Fountain of Youth."

1:38:20.916 --> 1:38:23.416
"Nor is the self-appointed committee

1:38:24.375 --> 1:38:29.250
required to explain
why they supervised the starvation

1:38:29.916 --> 1:38:31.750
of one more Irish child."

1:38:33.625 --> 1:38:39.541
"Perhaps it is not a village
that gathers to grieve what it has lost

1:38:39.625 --> 1:38:41.750
and repent its sins of omission,

1:38:42.708 --> 1:38:44.666
nor a single nation."

1:38:46.208 --> 1:38:47.833
"All over the empire,

1:38:48.583 --> 1:38:53.583
are not children left to lie down
and die in ditches and gutters

1:38:53.666 --> 1:38:55.458
every night of the year?"

1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.625
"It is a whole sorrowful world

1:39:00.708 --> 1:39:03.625
that's too hungry to see the wonder

1:39:03.708 --> 1:39:06.416
in every ordinary child."

1:39:06.500 --> 1:39:08.500
[music continues]

1:39:11.458 --> 1:39:12.541
[disembodied whisper]

1:39:26.458 --> 1:39:28.458
[music continues]

1:39:48.583 --> 1:39:51.166
[indistinct distant shouting]

1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:00.666
[faint tapping]

1:40:01.375 --> 1:40:02.625
[heavier tapping]

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:08.208
[muffled] Mrs. Lib?

1:40:10.541 --> 1:40:13.583
[serene ethereal music plays]

1:40:28.708 --> 1:40:30.708
[music continues]

1:40:38.750 --> 1:40:41.416
[man 1] Passengers
for the SS Northumberland,

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:42.833
bound for Sydney!

1:40:42.916 --> 1:40:45.041
-[music fades out]
-[man 2] Open the gate.

1:40:45.125 --> 1:40:47.125
[indistinct chatter]

1:40:52.125 --> 1:40:54.416
-[man 1] Names?
-Uh, Elizabeth Cheshire.

1:41:00.041 --> 1:41:02.833
C-H-E-S-H-I-R-E.

1:41:04.791 --> 1:41:06.041
Wilkie Cheshire.

1:41:09.833 --> 1:41:11.166
Your name?

1:41:14.458 --> 1:41:16.083
[softly] It's all right, love. Go on.

1:41:19.250 --> 1:41:20.541
Nan Cheshire.

1:41:26.375 --> 1:41:29.000
-[man 1] All right. This way.
-Thank you.

1:41:32.083 --> 1:41:33.083
Next.

1:41:37.208 --> 1:41:39.208
[indistinct chatter]

1:41:45.625 --> 1:41:47.291
[inaudible chatter]

1:41:47.375 --> 1:41:50.375
[hopeful ethereal music plays]

1:42:10.250 --> 1:42:12.583
[ethereal music drowns out background]

1:42:16.875 --> 1:42:18.000
[disembodied whisper]

1:42:32.541 --> 1:42:34.291
[music fading out]

1:42:34.375 --> 1:42:36.583
In. Out.

1:42:37.291 --> 1:42:39.583
[whispers] In. Out.

1:42:39.666 --> 1:42:41.500
[music fades to silence]
