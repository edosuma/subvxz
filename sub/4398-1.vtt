Actually, that's not true.
I was sleeping under the counter.

and smells and all that stuff,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.790
so I was in Mexico
and I thought I'd pick it up.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.091
When were you in Mexico?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.360
Oh, about a half hour ago.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.363
It's beautiful.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.267
Legend says it only blooms
once every 200 years

12:47.334 --> 12:49.702
high atop the Sierra Guadalupe.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.704
- It bloomed today.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.775
That smell, it's so inspiring.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.244
It's, it's perfect.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.183
Oh, don't mind me,
I'll let myself out.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.152
Don't offer me a glass of
water or anything.

13:05.218 --> 13:09.356
It's not like I ran 2,500 miles
carrying an object three times my size.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.424
No big deal.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.861
Remember, rent is due tomorrow.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.132
You're not listening.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.633
I'll be back saying,
"Where's your rent check?"

13:20.700 --> 13:22.269
And you'll say, "I forgot.
Sorry, here it is."

13:22.335 --> 13:24.271
We do it every time. Whatever.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.840
Remember, rent is due tomorrow.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.878
(BEEPING)

13:34.147 --> 13:37.317
Well, I can afford to wait,
but I'm not sure she can.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.053
(DRILLING)

13:46.693 --> 13:48.061
Is it a drone?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.898
If it is, it's faster than any
drone we've got.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.700
We can't, I say,
we can't lose that flower.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.436
We've mapped the trajectory
and know where it ended up.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.837
Russia? China?

13:57.905 --> 13:59.306
New York City.

13:59.372 --> 14:03.410
1000 West 14th Street,
apartment 12 to be exact.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.779
We've got her.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.081
Her?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.051
Get me Fudd.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.386
Here's Fudd.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.523
I thought I fired you.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.059
You can't fire an intern.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.761
Hello, I say, hello, Fudd.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.330
Now just listen up
a minute, son.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.466
I say, I got...
I got a little problem here.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.172
There's been a development.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.608
I don't have the flower,
but I know who does.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.111
(SNORING)

14:45.418 --> 14:46.553
(SNIFFING)

14:46.619 --> 14:49.957
Hmm, that clove's coming on
a little strong.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.962
A little clove goes a long way.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.031
All right, let's see here.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.468
Maybe just a smidge of geranium.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.373
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Ooh, Mummy, that's nice.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.115
I have the wabbit in my sights.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.950
GENERAL: (ON PHONE)
What about the flower?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.885
Still there.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.288
GENERAL: Okay, son, stick with
her like a tick on a coonhound.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.456
- What?
- Just watch her.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.060
Okay, I've got the base
where I want it.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.562
And now the secret weapon.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.479
Here goes nothing.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.549
(INHALES DEEPLY)

15:51.318 --> 15:54.687
O-M-G!

15:55.388 --> 15:58.891
O-M-G!

15:58.958 --> 16:01.161
I did it!
I created my fragrance!

16:01.228 --> 16:04.564
She did it!
She created invisibility.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.734
Well, what are you, I say, what
are you talking to me for, son?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.136
Get in there!

16:13.006 --> 16:14.507
It smells so good!

16:14.574 --> 16:17.877
Ooh! I can't believe it.
Everyone's going to want this.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.180
Oh! Ow! Right in the eye.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.256
Ooh, that really stung.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.823
I'll have to put
a warning on the bottle.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.859
Close eyes before spraying.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.462
(GASPS) Ooh, I wonder what the
bottle's going to look like.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.896
I wonder what
I'm going to call it.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.465
Ooh, this perfume's
gonna be huge!

16:38.531 --> 16:40.233
- (KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Who could that be?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.569
(GASPS) That poor cab driver.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.071
Sorry, I'm coming.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.505
Got a little side-tracked,

16:45.572 --> 16:48.441
creating the world's most
beautiful fragrance.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.742
(SCREAMS)

(GRUNTS)

17:21.841 --> 17:22.909
Drive!

17:22.975 --> 17:25.445
Uh, I drive
when I decide to drive.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.152
I just decided to drive.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.591
Huh? (GRUMBLING)

17:38.658 --> 17:40.693
You want to tell me
what the heck is going on?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.895
Oh, you want to know what's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.331
I'll tell you
exactly what's going on.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.865
Can it be sometime today?

17:45.932 --> 17:49.169
The cosmetics industry
is made up of sharks.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.003
Well, not actual sharks.
That would be weird.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.506
Be kind of amazing though 'cause
sharks never stop swimming.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.974
So that means they would never
stop making cosmetics.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.110
What does this have to do
with us being shot at?

17:57.177 --> 18:00.213
Ten minutes ago, I created the
world's most beautiful fragrance.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.615
I know that sounds braggy,
but it's a fact.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.950
I know perfume.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.953
And I also know that this
bottle is worth millions,

18:07.019 --> 18:08.888
maybe billions.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.358
And everyone who's anyone in the
beauty industry is going to want it!

18:11.424 --> 18:14.727
I bet they were spying on me through binoculars
from the apartment across the street.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.863
No one was spying on you
through binoculars.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.699
I've been working on creating
this fragrance for years.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.502
Surely, I'm on everyone's radar
in the cosmetics industry.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.404
I'm probably
being bugged right now.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.539
Oh, no, I'm the one
being bugged.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.575
Okay, you know what,
drive to Paris.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.844
Uh, you can't drive to Paris.
You have to fly.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.846
Then take me to the airport.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.021
I'm not taking you anywhere!

18:42.088 --> 18:44.657
Please! I have to get this
to the House of Mouffette

18:44.724 --> 18:46.926
before someone
steals it from me.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.596
Well, I'm afraid you're going to have
to get there with someone else's help.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.864
Oh, is this about the money
I owe you?

18:51.931 --> 18:55.402
What was it, 20 bucks?
You're not going to help me for 20 bucks?

18:55.468 --> 18:58.137
Not that I'm counting,
but, uh...

18:58.705 --> 18:59.706
(BEEPS)

19:00.707 --> 19:02.008
(GULPS)

19:02.074 --> 19:03.843
Good thing I'm gonna be rich.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.612
Look, I promise I'll pay you.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.748
(GASPS) There's a bank right there.
We can do it right now.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.817
Trust me, this isn't
about the money.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.485
I insist.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.722
My mother taught me,
"Always repay your debts".

19:15.788 --> 19:17.957
Or was it, "Always brush
your hair before bed"?

19:18.024 --> 19:19.392
No, 'cause these are my ears.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.528
It was "Always
repay your debts".

19:21.594 --> 19:22.762
(YELLS)

19:25.765 --> 19:28.000
We can assume
they're working together.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.536
They have the same last name.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.839
So they're probably
a husband-and-wife crime team.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.641
Or brother-sister.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.678
I'm just saying.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.836
She ain't going to know what that is.
These are city folk.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.872
Hmm, maybe "bits".

20:05.938 --> 20:07.440
"Blasted to bits."

20:07.507 --> 20:09.909
That's got a ring to it.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.778
Course it's a squirt gun.

right either.

I read on the Internet, 10 surprising
foods that will supercharge your day,

25:28.527 --> 25:29.896
and one of them was hot dogs.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.664
So, every day on my way to work,

25:31.731 --> 25:34.066
I would stop at the same hot
dog vendor and get a hot dog.

Well, obviously, I couldn't
keep eating hot dogs,

25:44.210 --> 25:47.947

hot dog vendor to get to work.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.481

Oh, here we go again.

51:25.049 --> 51:27.485
This is precisely what our
therapist was talking about.

51:27.552 --> 51:29.854
I'm always invisible to you.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.322
I beg your pardon, no.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.625
Remember Keith said,
"No one is always anything."

51:34.692 --> 51:37.462
Oh, fine. I am usually
invisible to you.

51:37.528 --> 51:40.165
Why, because I ignored
your advice about my mother?

51:40.231 --> 51:41.632
Cut the cord, Mac.

51:41.699 --> 51:44.602
I told you, I'm going
to stop sending her money.

51:44.669 --> 51:46.504
Yes, but you say that
every month.

51:46.571 --> 51:49.174
I have to do it on my terms
and on my timetable.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.441
Cut the cord, Mac.

51:50.508 --> 51:52.243
MAC: I am working with Keith
on this.

51:52.310 --> 51:54.479
TOSH: You lie to my face.
MAC: What're you talking about?

51:54.545 --> 51:57.382
TOSH: You said you've not been in
contact and you've been in contact!

51:58.983 --> 52:01.152

52:01.219 --> 52:03.120
Oh, don't you turn this
around on me.

52:03.188 --> 52:04.622
The woman said she hated me.

52:04.689 --> 52:07.725
- Hated!
- Those are just words!

52:07.792 --> 52:09.327
Words are weapons, Mac.

52:09.394 --> 52:10.728
Cut the cord.

52:11.862 --> 52:13.464
- What's up, Doc?
- Hmm?

52:14.865 --> 52:16.601
I told you I'm not a doctor.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.669
I don't know what I am anymore.

52:18.736 --> 52:21.439
Well, you're about to become the
most famous person in the world.

52:21.506 --> 52:23.941
Think of all the possibilities
this offers.

52:24.008 --> 52:26.744
Whenever you want
you can go totally unnoticed.

52:26.811 --> 52:29.046
It's the ultimate
in being left alone.

52:29.113 --> 52:32.082
Invisibility is
a dream come true.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.751
Maybe that's your dream.

52:33.818 --> 52:34.819
It's not mine.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.654
Maybe it's time
you had a new dream.

52:36.721 --> 52:37.722
Look at that.

52:37.788 --> 52:40.458

in the world.

52:40.525 --> 52:42.260

52:42.327 --> 52:44.295
it can all be yours.

52:44.362 --> 52:46.497

52:49.300 --> 52:51.101

(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

1:02:23.808 --> 1:02:25.275
(PANTING)

1:03:24.869 --> 1:03:28.538
Stop right there,
Earth creatures!

1:03:32.209 --> 1:03:34.611
Lock them in the Captivator.

1:03:34.678 --> 1:03:37.014
- What?
- The Captivator.

1:03:37.081 --> 1:03:39.950
The place where you hold
someone captive.

1:03:40.017 --> 1:03:43.087
It's... Hmm, where is it?

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:45.856
I could have sworn
it was right over there.

1:03:45.923 --> 1:03:47.157
Oh, forget it.

1:03:47.224 --> 1:03:48.859
Everyone stand over there

1:03:48.926 --> 1:03:52.629
and if you move again
I'll vaporize you.

1:03:52.696 --> 1:03:54.198
- Huh!
- You too.

1:03:54.264 --> 1:03:56.566
What? I thought we had a deal.

1:03:56.633 --> 1:03:58.903
Oh, I should have listened
to my mother.

1:03:58.969 --> 1:04:02.239
She always said,
"Never trust a Martian."

1:04:02.306 --> 1:04:04.608
I'll deal with you later.

1:04:18.055 --> 1:04:19.823
And now it's time to say goodbye

1:04:19.890 --> 1:04:22.592
to your precious Earth.

1:04:26.130 --> 1:04:28.598
- Uh, hey, Doc.
- Mmm-hmm?

1:04:28.665 --> 1:04:31.501
If you're not going to do anything
with this bottle of perfume over here,

1:04:31.568 --> 1:04:33.437
would you mind
if I gave it to the girl,

1:04:33.503 --> 1:04:35.906
seeing as how it was
her lifelong dream and all.

1:04:35.973 --> 1:04:37.507
Do what you want

1:04:37.574 --> 1:04:40.510
because soon I will be placing
you all in the Eliminator,

1:04:40.577 --> 1:04:42.212
which is right over there.

1:04:42.279 --> 1:04:43.247
Huh!

1:04:43.313 --> 1:04:45.916
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

1:04:45.983 --> 1:04:48.485
How do you lose an Eliminator?

1:04:53.557 --> 1:04:55.492
Oh, goody. It's ready.

1:05:31.561 --> 1:05:32.963
What happened?

1:05:33.030 --> 1:05:36.133
Oh, were you wanting
something to disappear?

1:05:39.436 --> 1:05:40.670
Oh!

1:05:44.641 --> 1:05:46.210
Shoot them!

1:05:51.681 --> 1:05:52.682
Oh!

1:05:53.984 --> 1:05:55.952
BUGS BUNNY: I'll take those.

1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:57.421
CECIL: This way!

1:06:02.226 --> 1:06:05.295
I am so angry.

LOLA:
You switched the bottles?

1:06:07.497 --> 1:06:09.099
BUGS BUNNY: Ain't I a stinker?

1:06:12.236 --> 1:06:14.438
Whoa, what's this?

1:06:14.504 --> 1:06:17.841
"Illudium Q-36

- BUGS BUNNY: Hey, Marvin!
- Mmm-hmm?

1:06:25.382 --> 1:06:26.483
Catch.

1:06:27.251 --> 1:06:29.153
Oh, why, thank you.

1:06:29.219 --> 1:06:31.155
I've been looking for that.

1:06:45.869 --> 1:06:47.771
I hate Earthlings.

Fifi, I was so worried
about you.

1:07:39.289 --> 1:07:42.359
Fifi, come back. Fifi!

1:07:44.861 --> 1:07:46.230
(GASPING) Oh!

1:07:48.398 --> 1:07:50.100
Where's the bottle?

1:07:50.167 --> 1:07:51.568
In there.

1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.075
Well, it's probably
for the best.

1:07:59.143 --> 1:08:02.812
I don't think the world is
quite ready for invisibility.

1:08:02.879 --> 1:08:07.050
Well, it looks like you guys
got this under control,

1:08:07.117 --> 1:08:09.619
so I should probably be
on my way.

1:08:11.155 --> 1:08:12.356
Really?

1:08:15.225 --> 1:08:16.426
You're a turtle.

1:08:16.493 --> 1:08:18.295
- I'm going to catch you.
- Oh.

1:08:20.597 --> 1:08:23.099
Oh, Lola,
can you ever forgive me?

1:08:25.269 --> 1:08:27.237
Of course, I forgive you.

1:08:27.904 --> 1:08:30.106
Oh, thank you.

1:08:30.174 --> 1:08:32.576
- Hug?
- Don't push it.

1:08:35.011 --> 1:08:36.880
(SNIFFING) Do you smell that?

1:08:36.946 --> 1:08:39.015
(SNIFFING) I guess
your dream came true.

1:08:39.082 --> 1:08:41.885
You brought your fragrance
to the whole world after all.

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:43.320
I'm sorry your dream didn't.

1:08:43.387 --> 1:08:44.654
What was my dream?

1:08:44.721 --> 1:08:45.722
Getting to be all alone.

1:08:45.789 --> 1:08:48.325
Maybe it's time
I had a new dream.

1:08:58.968 --> 1:09:00.204
Lola!

1:09:02.272 --> 1:09:04.241
Speedy?
What are you doing here?

1:09:04.308 --> 1:09:05.975
I'm getting
my morning croissant.

1:09:06.042 --> 1:09:07.544
What are you doing here?

1:09:07.611 --> 1:09:09.313
You don't pay rent,
but you can afford to take

1:09:09.379 --> 1:09:12.148
a romantic trip to Paris
with your boyfriend?

1:09:12.216 --> 1:09:13.483
Aye, ya, ya.

1:09:13.550 --> 1:09:15.452
I'm going to Switzerland
for some hot chocolate.

- Monsieur Le Pew.

- Oh, my little bottle of love.
- BOTH: Oh!

1:09:43.046 --> 1:09:44.248
Excusez-moi.

1:09:44.314 --> 1:09:46.450
My audience, she awaits.

1:09:48.218 --> 1:09:49.919
Bonjour, mes amis.

1:09:49.986 --> 1:09:53.089
Before I unveil
our latest fragrance,

1:09:53.156 --> 1:09:55.325
I wish to say a few words.

1:09:55.392 --> 1:09:56.526
One year ago,

1:09:56.593 --> 1:09:58.428
for a brief moment,

1:09:58.495 --> 1:10:03.032
the most unforgettable scent
covered the world

1:10:03.099 --> 1:10:06.370
and I feared that we would
never smell something

1:10:06.436 --> 1:10:08.538
that beautiful again.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:12.642
But I was wrong.

1:10:12.709 --> 1:10:17.447
After all, this scent was
created by the same woman.

1:10:17.514 --> 1:10:21.050
I give you "Lola"!

1:10:21.117 --> 1:10:22.819
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1:10:39.336 --> 1:10:41.805
What is the word, Doctor?

1:10:45.442 --> 1:10:47.911
Oh, what, I did it wrong?
Well, I'm sorry.

1:10:49.446 --> 1:10:50.547
How was your day?

1:10:50.614 --> 1:10:52.782
Busy, just the way I like it.

1:10:54.918 --> 1:10:55.752
How was yours?

1:10:55.819 --> 1:10:58.021
Not busy,
just the way I like it.

1:10:59.723 --> 1:11:02.326
So, what'd you want
to do tonight? (CLICKS TONGUE)

1:11:02.392 --> 1:11:04.060
I thought we could go
to the game.

1:11:04.127 --> 1:11:05.929
But it's the playoffs.
It's sold out.

1:11:05.995 --> 1:11:07.631
Eh, we'll get in.

1:11:07.697 --> 1:11:08.832
Trust me.

1:11:09.232 --> 1:11:10.434
How?

1:11:10.867 --> 1:11:11.668
Huh!

1:11:11.735 --> 1:11:13.637
Is that what I think it is?

1:11:13.703 --> 1:11:15.939
You've had it this whole time?

1:11:16.005 --> 1:11:17.541

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:18.608
No.

1:11:18.675 --> 1:11:21.077
Well, maybe one time.

1:11:51.508 --> 1:11:53.910
- What's your name?
- (QUACKING)

1:11:55.445 --> 1:11:57.013
That's a stupid name.

That's all, folks!

1:12:06.222 --> 1:12:07.357
Interesting.
