- Mom, I'm gonna be late.

02:31.673 --> 02:35.285
- Since when are you in
a hurry to get to school?

02:35.372 --> 02:36.982
- I don't want detention.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.333
Drake and I are playing
"Hunters Watch" after school.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.900
- Boys.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.776
- Have you see my blue notebook,
the one with the spirals?

02:47.863 --> 02:49.299
- You are not making us
late for school again.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.127
- You put it in your
backpack at breakfast.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.650
- Oh yeah.

02:55.827 --> 02:56.741
- Your lunch.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.221
- Thanks.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.049
- It's 8:02, mom!

03:00.136 --> 03:01.137
- Hey.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.878
Yeah, I finished it.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.010
It was only 20 questions.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.143
- Okay, everybody in the car.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.928
Was anybody gonna tell me?

03:11.365 --> 03:12.148
Brennan.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.021
Okay, sure.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.197
I'll head that way now.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.633
Is this a 55A?

03:18.720 --> 03:19.460
- A homicide?

03:21.897 --> 03:24.073
- Okay, I'll be right there.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.076
- Someone died?

03:27.163 --> 03:29.600
- An elderly woman
up on Briar Rock.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.559
She's a mountain
woman, there's no ID.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.474
- There's still mountain
people living up there?

03:33.561 --> 03:35.432
- A few, as far as
anyone can tell.

03:35.519 --> 03:36.390
- Why are you getting the call?

03:36.477 --> 03:38.043
- The store manager in town

03:38.130 --> 03:40.568
thinks she may have been
keeping a boy on her homestead.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.483
If so, he's up there all alone.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.832
- Well then you better hurry.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.225
I'll run the kids to school.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.748
- What about your
writing deadline?

03:46.835 --> 03:48.140
- It's all up here.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.620
Typing it out as
just a formality.

03:49.707 --> 03:50.447
- Thank you.

03:54.103 --> 03:54.930
- I'm gonna be late.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.018
- And I'm gone.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.237
Good luck finding the boy.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
- [Janelle] If there is one.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.981
- Store manager said
she ordered her supplies

04:03.068 --> 04:05.070
under the name of the
Lila Mae Whittaker.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.115
- So we have an ID then?

04:06.202 --> 04:08.944
- It could be an alias.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.120
He also had an order
from Nathaniel Hawthorne.

04:11.207 --> 04:14.123
Coroner's best guess is
she was in her mid 80's.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.517
- So why are we
assuming she had a kid?

04:16.604 --> 04:18.954
- She ordered a copy
of "Tom Sawyer".

04:19.041 --> 04:20.608
- [Janelle] So she likes Twain.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.002
- And a pair of size
10 male work boots.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.091
- The storekeeper is
quite the detective.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.658
He should come work for us.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.094
- Well, this may all
be a wild goose chase,

04:29.181 --> 04:30.966
but if we suspect
there's a minor involved,

04:31.053 --> 04:32.272
we have to check it out.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.970
- We sure this is
the right path?

04:35.057 --> 04:36.232
- I have no idea.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.626
According to the chopper survey,

04:38.713 --> 04:40.105
there's supposed to be
a thick cluster of trees

04:40.192 --> 04:42.369
over that ridge there
that could cover a house.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.370
Let's check it out.

04:46.677 --> 04:47.417
- Hold on.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.203
You better come look at this.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.555
- Well, I'll be.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.732
Jeremiah Whittaker.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.256
Could be the husband,
this isn't new.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.866
Let's keep moving.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.346
Keep your eyes open.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.782
Most people up
here are friendly,

05:04.869 --> 05:06.828
but a few wave hello
with their shotguns.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.081
Anyone home?

05:48.478 --> 05:49.261
Hello?

05:51.263 --> 05:53.744
- We don't have a
warrant to go in.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.006
Let's comb the property.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.142
[ominous music]

06:07.454 --> 06:10.108
There's definitely
someone living here.

06:10.195 --> 06:13.068
[ominous music]

06:13.155 --> 06:14.069
Brennan.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.157
- On it.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.682
[dramatic music]

06:49.844 --> 06:51.759
It's a male between 15 and 18.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.195
He just vanished.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.457
- All right, I'll
head down this way.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.154
He may cut back to the cabin.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.373
- I'll do a sweep here and
meet you back up the hill.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.809
- Be careful.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.289
We have no idea what
this kid is like.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.160
Don't hesitate to defend
yourself if you have to.

07:03.248 --> 07:06.077
[ominous music]

07:20.048 --> 07:21.092
- You gave me quite
a chase there.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.008
My name is Deputy Brennan.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.054
I'm with the County
Sheriff's department.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.055
We need to talk.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.666
I'm not here to hurt you.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.755
I just need to make
sure you're all right.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.455
Any chance you could
come out of there?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.243
Do you know a Lila
Mae Whittaker?

07:43.288 --> 07:45.029
- Yes.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.074
- Is she your grandmother?

07:47.205 --> 07:49.077
- No, she looks after me though.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.863
- There's no easy
way to say this.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.779
- She passed, didn't she?

07:57.085 --> 07:58.260
- I'm afraid so.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.131
Are you here alone?

08:02.873 --> 08:04.353
- Pap passed awhile back.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.749
- I found this wooden bird.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.492
I think maybe you dropped it.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.848
It's beautiful.

08:20.935 --> 08:21.675
Did you make it?

08:23.894 --> 08:24.895
- It's gran's.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.377
Pap whittled it for her.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.205
- What about your mom or dad?

08:30.292 --> 08:31.859
They ever come around?

08:31.946 --> 08:33.034
- No, I ain't never,

08:34.339 --> 08:36.994
I haven't ever seen them.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.605
- [Callier] Brennan,
have you spotted him?

08:38.692 --> 08:39.606
- Oh, it's okay.

08:39.693 --> 08:40.781
It's okay, it's just my radio.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.087
- I've read about radios.

08:45.133 --> 08:45.960
- Yeah, he's here.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.963
- On my way.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.617
- No, no, don't
come down just yet.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.009
We're talking.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.054
- [Callier] Are you good?

08:53.141 --> 08:54.664
- Yeah, he seems okay.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.407
- [Finch] Who are
you talking to?

08:58.494 --> 09:00.104
- The county sheriff.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.280
He's been helping
me look for you.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.195
- Does it play music, too?

09:04.282 --> 09:05.153
- My radio?

09:06.284 --> 09:07.590
No.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.113
No, it's not that
kind of a radio.

09:10.027 --> 09:10.941
Do you like music?

09:12.290 --> 09:13.335
My phone can play music.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.644
- Your telephone?

09:20.124 --> 09:20.908
- Yeah.

09:21.865 --> 09:22.562
See?

09:25.216 --> 09:25.913
- I don't see any wires.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.351
- Have you ever been off
this mountain before?

09:29.438 --> 09:30.874
- No, ma'am.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.616
My gran said if ever
I leave this mountain

09:33.703 --> 09:35.836
folks down below might
never let me come back.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.579
- You said you
read about radios.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.536
Do you like to read?

09:40.623 --> 09:42.146
- Yes, ma'am.

09:42.233 --> 09:45.106
I have books on a
shelf near my bed.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.978
I have bunches of
them, 12 in all.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.850
I've read them so many times,

09:49.937 --> 09:51.242
I can almost say them by rote,

09:52.330 --> 09:54.289
except'n the Bible.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.073
I'm still working
on learning it.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.336
Now that's a big one.

09:58.423 --> 10:01.731
But my gran wants me to
have that one right up here

10:01.818 --> 10:03.733
so that I can use it
whenever I need it.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.257
She promised me

10:06.344 --> 10:09.609
that when I finished reading
the whole thing cover to cover

10:09.696 --> 10:11.306
that she would
use her wool money

10:11.393 --> 10:13.525
to buy me a copy of Tom...

10:17.181 --> 10:18.052
- What's your name?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.228
- Finch.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.142
- Oh, like the bird.

10:22.926 --> 10:26.495
- My gran raised a baby bird
she found alone in the woods.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.497
She used to say that
when I was little,

10:28.584 --> 10:30.499
I reminded her of the finch.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.806
So that's where she got my name.

10:32.893 --> 10:36.505
- Look Finch, I'm
afraid it's time to go.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.987
- Oh, well thanks
for looking after me.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.076
Maybe you could come
visit'n again sometime.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.208
- No, no, that's
not what I mean.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.210
We're gonna need
you to come with us.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.734
- No, I'll be fine here.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.474
I can take care of myself.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.128
I like it here.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.654
- I know you do, but you see
I'm responsible for you now

10:54.741 --> 10:56.090
and I have to make sure

10:56.177 --> 10:57.613
that you have enough
good food to eat,

10:57.700 --> 10:59.049
that you get a good education.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.965
- Well there's plenty
of food to be had here.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.533
And I've got my
books to learn from.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.362
- But you said you
already knew them all.

11:07.449 --> 11:08.929
Wouldn't you like
to read new books,

11:09.016 --> 11:11.540
go to a library?

11:11.627 --> 11:13.150
- To a library?

11:13.237 --> 11:15.196
- Yeah, there they have
hundreds and hundreds of books

11:15.283 --> 11:19.330
about anything you can
imagine and they're all free.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.419
- Hundreds?

11:25.293 --> 11:29.645
But what about the
homestead and the animals?

11:29.732 --> 11:31.342
I have to stay here.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.475
I have to take
care of everything.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.303
- We'll resettle
the animals for you.

11:38.828 --> 11:39.524
- I don't know.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.571
- [Callier] Brennan,
we need to head out.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.529
- Finch, it's time.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.578
Sheriff's waiting.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.190
- It's not for good.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.150
I'm coming back.

11:56.237 --> 11:56.890
- Okay.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.460
- If you did your reading last
night, the quiz will be easy.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.201
Thomas Jefferson once said

12:04.288 --> 12:06.987
nothing can stop the man with
the right mental attitude

12:07.074 --> 12:08.945
from achieving his goal.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.121
Nothing on earth can help,

12:11.208 --> 12:13.123
Toby clear your desk, please.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.257
See me after class.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.007
[bell ringing]

12:33.709 --> 12:34.492
Sit.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.323
Toby, you have not turned in

12:39.410 --> 12:41.064
your last four
homework assignments

12:41.151 --> 12:43.588
and you are now
failing this class.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.112
You're capable of passing.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.289
I've seen what you can do
when you apply yourself.

12:48.376 --> 12:51.292
Is something preventing
you from doing your work?

12:51.379 --> 12:52.162
Is there a problem at home?

12:52.249 --> 12:53.860
- No.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.426
- Look, I'm willing
to work with you,

12:55.513 --> 12:57.254
but you have to meet me halfway.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.256
I will take your back
work at a reduced grade

12:59.343 --> 13:01.258
if you get it into me by Monday.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.304
Otherwise I'll have to call
a parent teacher conference

13:03.391 --> 13:05.132
and sort this out.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.134
Can I give you another
piece of advice?

13:09.745 --> 13:12.095
Take up a sport, join a club.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.705
The other kids might
include you more

13:13.793 --> 13:15.142
if they got to know you

13:15.229 --> 13:16.317
a little bit better
outside of class.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.666
- Can I go now?

13:17.753 --> 13:19.233
- Monday, that's the deadline.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.240
[phone ringing]

13:26.327 --> 13:27.371
- His first time in a car.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.938
Won't this be fun?

13:29.025 --> 13:30.984
Hines, I need my car detailed
and get CPS down here.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.376
- [Janelle] And
get him some water

13:32.463 --> 13:34.117
and something to
settle with stomach.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.339
- What is this place?

13:38.426 --> 13:40.167
- [Callier] Has
anybody seen Janie?

13:40.254 --> 13:41.821
- [Janelle] Finch.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.912
- Janie, where's my case
file from yesterday?

13:45.999 --> 13:46.782
- I'm on it.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.407
- Extension 401, please.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.627
This is Janelle Brennan.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.717
Yes, I'll hold.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.640
Finch.

14:18.727 --> 14:22.949
Jeff, you got him flaming hot
chips to settle his stomach?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.211
- It helps me.

14:25.995 --> 14:26.953
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.998
- Steve, I'm glad to see you.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.565
Finch, this is Steve Anderson

14:30.652 --> 14:32.088
with Child Protective Services.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.655
- Child Protective?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.048
- It's an agency designed
to help young people

14:35.135 --> 14:36.092
in your situation.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.659
- My situation?

14:37.746 --> 14:39.139
- Yeah, you and I are
gonna go to my office,

14:39.226 --> 14:40.749
I'm gonna get some
information from you.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.185
Then we'll have a
doctor check you out

14:42.272 --> 14:43.708
and get you assigned
to a foster family.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.145
- Foster family?

14:45.232 --> 14:46.886
- Steve, this is all
very new to Finch.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.671
You may need to go slowly
and explain things in detail.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.541
- Of course.

14:50.628 --> 14:51.716
This is Paul Kramer.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.022
He's one of our foster parents.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.154
I need to take this.

14:55.764 --> 14:56.547
- Foster parents?

14:58.071 --> 14:59.681
- You'll need to be
placed in a temporary home

14:59.768 --> 15:01.813
with a family who
will look after you.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.077
- But you said that you
were responsible for me.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.081
- I didn't mean me personally.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.517
- But that's what you said.

15:09.604 --> 15:10.692
- Finch, it'll be all right.

15:10.779 --> 15:11.823
I know Paul Kramer.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.303
He has a wonderful family

15:13.390 --> 15:15.305
who will make sure you
have everything you need.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.437
- No, no, no, I
want to go back now.

15:16.524 --> 15:17.873
- Whoa, easy, easy.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.656
- I just need to go home.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.180
- Finch stop.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.137
- [Male] No one's gonna
hurt you, just calm down.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.095
- [Janelle] Leave him alone.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.227
- I really need to go home.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.099
- Call psych, we're
bringing him in right now.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.057
- He doesn't understand
what you're doing.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.624
- [Finch] Let go of me.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.713
- Just explain it to him, Steve.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.851
Hey, sorry I'm late, crazy day.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.765
- Welcome home.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.160
[gentle music]

15:47.468 --> 15:50.253
- Lisa, the school called to
say you failed every class

15:50.340 --> 15:52.473
and you're gonna have to
repeat the sixth grade.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.474
- Okay.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.519
- Jack, NASA called.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.304
They definitely want you
for the Mars mission.

15:57.391 --> 15:58.653
You leave in the morning.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.699
- Mom, you're home.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.049
- Oh, hi mom.

16:03.136 --> 16:03.832
- There are my babies.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.399
Devices down.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.316
So let's hear it.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.186
How was school?

16:11.753 --> 16:13.407
- The teacher called Heath
and me up to the board

16:13.494 --> 16:15.235
to solve a quadratic equation.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.106
- What's a quadratic equation?

16:17.193 --> 16:21.589
- It's a complicated
math problem.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.025
And?

16:23.112 --> 16:24.722
- Heath gives me
this yeah right look

16:24.809 --> 16:27.290
'cause he thinks he's the
smartest guy in the class.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.117
- And?

16:28.204 --> 16:29.814
- Nailed it.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.208
Heath had to get help from
the teacher to finish it.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.036
- Up top, yes.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.733
- Where's Toby?

16:35.820 --> 16:39.476
- He lost track of
time over at Drake's.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.087
He's on his way home now.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.436
- [Janelle] Well,
this looks wonderful.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.046
I am starving.

16:44.133 --> 16:48.224
- Did you find what
you were looking for?

16:48.311 --> 16:51.097
- Yeah, we found him.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.316
- Dad finished chapter
21 of his book today.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.143
- He did?

16:54.230 --> 16:55.623
That's wonderful.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.625
- Yep, I have one
more chapter to finish

16:57.712 --> 16:59.670
before the manuscript
deadline on Monday.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.281
- We have to keep the
house quiet this weekend

17:01.368 --> 17:02.760
so dad can write.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.893
I volunteered to
go stay at Dina's.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.460
- Oh, that's quite
the sacrifice.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.071
- It's vital to
support the arts.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.030
- And I said that if
Toby makes me mad,

17:11.117 --> 17:13.989
I'll scream into my
pillow so I won't bug dad.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.035
- I like the way
you're planning ahead.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.084
- You're almost an hour late.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.172
- Sorry.

17:24.739 --> 17:25.827
- How was your day at school?

17:25.914 --> 17:26.741
- Fine.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.047
- Oh, I almost forgot,

17:28.134 --> 17:30.353
I got an A on my
science report on frogs.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.703
- Hey, congratulations, champ.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.183
Toby, you never told me

17:34.270 --> 17:36.229
how you did on your
math test last week.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.926
- You never asked.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.976
- So Deputy Brennan,
AKA supermom,

17:45.064 --> 17:49.198
found a lost boy up in the
mountains today and rescued him.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.417
- I don't know about rescuing

17:50.504 --> 17:52.636
but yes, we brought down a boy

17:52.723 --> 17:53.942
who'd been living
up in the mountains.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.030
- Like Mowgli?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.597
Was he raised by wolves?

17:56.684 --> 17:57.989
- Seriously?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.253
- No, Jack, he had
a human family.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.603
- Was he wild and
grungy looking?

18:02.690 --> 18:05.997
- No, there was
nothing wild about him.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.042
- He's probably dumb as a rock

18:07.129 --> 18:08.435
if he's never been in school.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.959
- He's a normal boy
just like everyone else.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.569
- No one's saying-

18:12.656 --> 18:15.311
- He's a bright caring young
man with human feelings.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.487
I don't know why
everyone has to judge him

18:17.574 --> 18:18.923
because he's different.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.103
- Fine, we get it.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.104
- Sorry mom.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.194
- No, I'm sorry.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.760
I just-

18:29.847 --> 18:31.153
- So what kinds of things
does he like to do?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.460
- Yeah, does he hunt bears?

18:33.547 --> 18:35.026
- I don't know.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.160
He raises sheep and pigs.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.248
He likes to go fishing.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.121
But mostly he loves to read.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.166
- Sounds fun.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.212
- I don't know, that
sounds pretty good to me.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.822
Sounds like my kind of kid.

18:57.397 --> 19:00.182
- Brennan, I need you to
report on the Fitch boy ASAP.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.142
CPS wants the file in
front of the judge today.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.534
- Can we move Finch
out of cell four?

19:04.621 --> 19:06.014
I've got a perp coming in.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.276
- What do you mean cell four?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.541
- I'll be in my office.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.720
Before you start,

19:16.807 --> 19:18.200
the kid had to sleep in
a jail cell last night

19:18.287 --> 19:20.376
because I didn't have any
place else to put him.

19:20.463 --> 19:21.247
- What about the Kramer's?

19:21.334 --> 19:22.770
- Couldn't take him.

19:22.857 --> 19:23.684
They said they couldn't
handle his special needs.

19:23.771 --> 19:24.598
- So you put him in jail?

19:24.685 --> 19:26.121
- For his own safety.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.428
We did everything we could
to make him comfortable.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.995
- Don't worry, CPS has already
found foster placement,

19:31.082 --> 19:32.083
he's going there tonight.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.128
- I should hope so.

19:33.215 --> 19:33.868
Who's taking him?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.914
- He's going to
the Bartlow house.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.394
- That can't be right.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.135
The Bartlow house is shut down.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.050
I busted him for
possession two weeks ago.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.095
- Nope, he got out
on a technicality.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.272
- You're gonna send
the boy to Bartlow?

19:46.359 --> 19:48.622
What was Charles
Manson's house full?

19:48.709 --> 19:49.623
- It's CPS' call.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.015
I don't have a choice.

19:51.102 --> 19:51.929
- Bartlow is not a
real foster home.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.322
It's a drug cartel.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.106
He uses those kids
to make his runs.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.978
- We don't have a say in this.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.197
- Maybe you don't, but I do.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.676
- Brennan.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.330
- No, you have seen
him Bob, he's lost.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.506
He wouldn't last one
night at Bartlow's.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.899
- [Callier] Janelle.

20:04.986 --> 20:05.639
- Hines, forward
my calls, will you?

20:05.726 --> 20:07.075
- Sure thing.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.207
- [Janelle] I'll be
at the courthouse.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.077
- Hines!

20:13.037 --> 20:13.995
- I'm sorry, lieutenant,

20:14.082 --> 20:15.170
Judge Raymond is in court today.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.040
Can I make you an appointment?

20:16.127 --> 20:17.041
- This is urgent.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.000
I can't make it, Marguerite.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.525
Marguerite, am I
glad to see you.

20:22.612 --> 20:23.570
- Janelle, how are you?

20:23.657 --> 20:24.919
- Do you have the CPS case

20:25.006 --> 20:27.095
for the Finch boy
from Briar Rock?

20:27.182 --> 20:29.750
- No, Jason in the state office
is handling that one, why?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.317
- Can you get it?

20:31.404 --> 20:33.710
They placed the boy at
Ernest Barlow's house.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
- I thought Bartlow was in jail.

20:35.364 --> 20:38.541
- Exactly, he has got
to go someplace else.

20:38.628 --> 20:41.283
- Even if I could get
the case reassigned,

20:41.370 --> 20:44.286
once he's placed, I can't
remove him without cause.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.461
- Cause?

20:45.548 --> 20:47.115
You know what Bartlow is.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.899
- He's never been convicted.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.511
Besides there's no place
else for the boy to go.

20:51.598 --> 20:52.338
- I'll take him.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.078
Place him with me.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.907
- Janelle, you have to be
certified for foster care.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.257
- I am.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.867
We are, Keith and
I are certified.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.390
We had to be before
we adopted Jackson.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.392
I could have the paperwork
to you within the hour.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.915
- I'm sorry.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.961
I don't like Bartlow
any more than you do,

21:07.048 --> 21:09.006
but rules are rules.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.443
And right now neither one of us

21:10.530 --> 21:12.575
has the authority
to move the boy.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.838
So if you'll,
excuse me, I'm late.

21:16.144 --> 21:16.884
- Adoption.

21:18.581 --> 21:19.147
- What?

21:20.191 --> 21:21.541
- If Finch was being adopted,

21:21.628 --> 21:23.456
he could be pulled
from Bartlow's.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.414
- That's true, but-

21:25.501 --> 21:27.895
- Okay, so we're adopting him.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.418
- Janelle-

21:29.505 --> 21:31.072
- You could transfer him
to us right away today.

21:31.159 --> 21:34.641
- You can't just pretend
to want to adopt.

21:34.728 --> 21:38.122
- It'll buy him some time until
I can find him a safer home.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.037
- What am I supposed
to tell the judge,

21:40.124 --> 21:41.822
or the boy for that matter?

21:41.909 --> 21:43.998
- That Keith and I
are giving him a home.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.739
- For how long?

21:45.826 --> 21:47.262
Keith doesn't even know

21:47.349 --> 21:49.046
that we're having this
conversation, does he?

21:49.133 --> 21:50.657
- For however long it takes.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.223
I promise you, Marguerite.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.617
I will not dump Finch
back into the system.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.446
I will take care of him until
a permanent home can be found.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.362
- I hope you know
what you're doing.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.103
- So you'll talk to Judge
Raymond this afternoon?

22:02.190 --> 22:03.539
- I'll see what I can do,

22:03.626 --> 22:05.802
but I'm not making any promises.

22:05.889 --> 22:08.370
- Please, make it
happen, Marguerite.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.166
- I don't know how
you pulled this off.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.907
- Don't ask.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.735
Hey, can we talk?

22:25.822 --> 22:27.171
- We'll leave you to it.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.480
- Look, Finch-

22:31.567 --> 22:32.699
- I want to go home.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.572
- I'm afraid that's
not possible.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.705
- Are you gonna
lock me up again?

22:38.792 --> 22:40.141
Because if you don't,

22:40.228 --> 22:42.099
I'm going to find a way
back to that mountain.

22:42.186 --> 22:46.016
- Okay, okay, yeah,
I'll take you back.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.975
But before we go,

22:48.062 --> 22:50.020
I'd like you to come
to my house for dinner

22:50.107 --> 22:51.239
and meet my family.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.460
- Your family?

22:54.547 --> 22:57.593
- Yeah, my husband
and my three kids.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.117
I have a son who's
just your age.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.292
I'd like you to meet them.

23:02.598 --> 23:03.817
Will you do that for me?

23:05.862 --> 23:07.037
- And then we'll go back?

23:09.910 --> 23:11.694
- If that's what you want, yes.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.181
- Will we ride in the car again?

23:20.268 --> 23:21.748
- No, I completely understand.

23:21.835 --> 23:22.966
- Hi dad.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.578
- Shh, he's on the phone.

23:25.665 --> 23:26.927
- I'm gonna go say
hello to Lenny.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.276
- Rats don't talk.

23:28.363 --> 23:29.973
- He's not a rat,
he's a hamster.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.975
- Oh, well in that case.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.586
- Well, I appreciate
you calling.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.415
- This smells delicious.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.026
I'm starving.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.462
- I thought you were staying
at Dina's this weekend.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.203
- Her brother decided
to come home from school

23:42.290 --> 23:44.466
so they're having some
family time together.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.990
I'm going to my room.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.259
- That was your history teacher,

23:55.346 --> 23:57.000
Miss Barnett on the phone.

23:57.958 --> 23:58.654
- Oh?

24:01.396 --> 24:03.050
- Anything you want to tell me?

24:06.053 --> 24:07.054
- Dinner smells good.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.753
- Well, what do
you want me to say?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.189
I'm sorry?

24:12.276 --> 24:14.017
I'm sorry I don't get
straight A's like Lisa.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.628
- Nobody expects that.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.891
- Yeah, because
I'm your dumb kid.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.240
- Oh, come on Toby.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.589
You know that's
not what I meant.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.112
- I'll be up in my room.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.592
- And then we'll sit
down with your mother

24:23.679 --> 24:25.333
and talk about this
after dinner tonight.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.509
- You have a publishing
deadline, remember?

24:28.379 --> 24:30.120
- We'll talk.

24:30.207 --> 24:30.991
- Sure we will.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.651
- Lenny's gone, I can't
find him anywhere.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.827
- Did you close his cage after
you fed him this morning?

24:40.914 --> 24:41.871
- I thought I did.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.046
We have to find him.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.931
- You live here?

24:58.018 --> 24:58.801
- Yeah.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.240
- It's really big.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.767
It's like having the
outside on the inside.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.379
- Hmm.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.252
I've never thought of
it that way before.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.126
You can put your stuff
down right over there.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.171
Let me go find everyone
and I'll introduce you.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.700
[mysterious music]

25:58.426 --> 26:00.080
- I don't see him anywhere.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.125
- Hey, what's going on?

26:02.212 --> 26:03.649
- Lenny got out again.

26:03.736 --> 26:04.998
- Oh.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.087
- [Lisa] That rat
better not come near me.

26:07.174 --> 26:08.958
- He's not a rat.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.612
- Take Sebastian outside please

26:10.699 --> 26:12.614
and go finish the salad.

26:12.701 --> 26:13.963
Thank you.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.138
- Have your checked your closet?

26:15.225 --> 26:16.705
He likes to get in your shoes.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.185
- No.

[mysterious music]

26:53.220 --> 26:55.570
[screaming]

26:55.657 --> 26:57.224
- It attacked me.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.094
- I got it.

27:01.054 --> 27:01.968
- No!

27:02.055 --> 27:05.058
- You leave my hamster alone.

27:05.145 --> 27:08.061
- Jack, take Lenny and put
him back up in his cage.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.671
- Cage?

27:09.758 --> 27:12.848
You know you really should
try raising rabbits.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.068
That thing's hardly a mouthful.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.722
- Ugh.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.680
- No, hamsters, aren't
for eating, they're pets.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.160
- Who is this guy?

27:20.247 --> 27:22.292
- Oh, I'm sorry.

27:22.379 --> 27:25.426
Everyone, this is Finch.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.342
I invited him to stay
with us for dinner.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.823
- I'm Keith, hi.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.520
So how do you two
know each other?

27:32.607 --> 27:35.479
- Finch is the young man I met
up on Briar Rock yesterday.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.090
- This is the
hillbilly you rescued?

27:37.177 --> 27:38.178
Ow!

27:38.265 --> 27:40.049
- Finch, these are our children,

27:40.136 --> 27:41.660
Lisa, Toby and Jack.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.052
You've met Lenny.

27:43.139 --> 27:43.923
- Dinner, huh?

27:44.010 --> 27:44.967
What's he gonna eat?

27:45.054 --> 27:46.055
- We'll go put Lenny away.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.840
- And we'll finish up in here.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.493
Toby and Lisa, set
the table please.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.235
And Finch, why don't
you go wash up?

27:58.111 --> 27:59.460
- Why is he here?

27:59.547 --> 28:01.505
- Because I invited him.

28:01.592 --> 28:05.509
So be polite and please do not
use the word hillbilly again.

28:05.596 --> 28:06.293
- Fine.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.860
How about Yokel?

28:07.947 --> 28:09.165
- Toby.

28:09.252 --> 28:12.125
- Where did he
get those clothes?

28:12.212 --> 28:14.127
- I imagine they're homemade.

28:14.214 --> 28:15.911
That's how they do
things where he's from.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.130
- That's not all they do.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.000
Look.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.002
- Oh no.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.961
[Playful Music]

28:22.048 --> 28:24.267
- He's a total nut job.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.748
- Look, it's only for
a couple of hours.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.098
So let's try and make
him feel at home.

28:29.185 --> 28:32.014
- Dina is not going
to believe this.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.892
- This all looks wonderful.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.632
- Yeah, I'm starving.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.728
- What?

28:49.815 --> 28:52.905
- Finch, would you like
to say grace for us?

28:57.039 --> 28:58.127
- Thank you God

28:58.214 --> 29:00.651
for your bountiful provision

29:00.739 --> 29:03.306
and for letting me spend
time with this nice family.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.526
Amen.

29:05.613 --> 29:06.396
- [All] Amen.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.139
- Finch, I hope
you like spaghetti.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.228
- I don't believe
I've met her, ma'am.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.143
[laughing]

29:14.230 --> 29:15.536
- Guests first.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.931
Finch, spaghetti isn't a person.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.106
It's the name of this food.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.498
- Oh

29:21.585 --> 29:23.283
- It comes from a
country known as Italy.

29:23.370 --> 29:26.155
- Actually, it originated
as Chinese noodles.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.157
Marco Polo introduced
it to the Italians

29:28.244 --> 29:29.724
when he returned from China.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.074
- I don't know if I
like Chinese noodles.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.119
- Don't be an idiot.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.207
- Toby, that's enough.

29:36.296 --> 29:39.386
So Finch, Janelle tells me
that you're an avid reader.

29:39.473 --> 29:40.779
- Yes, sir.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.519
- Well, what's
your favorite book?

29:42.606 --> 29:43.956
- "Oliver Twist".

29:44.043 --> 29:47.046
- Dickens, he is my
favorite as well.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.787
Have you ever read
"David Copperfield"?

29:48.874 --> 29:50.353
- No sir.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.791
- After dinner tonight,
I'll take you to the library

29:52.878 --> 29:56.490
and you can see my 1917
illustrated edition.

29:56.577 --> 29:57.970
The artwork is stunning.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.885
- You have a library?

29:59.972 --> 30:01.364
- I do.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.976
After dinner, we'll
take you on a tour.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.154
how did your meeting
with the editor go?

30:08.241 --> 30:12.114

make my deadline this weekend,

we're good to go for
a November release

Christmas shopping season.

[Slurps Loudly]

30:22.429 --> 30:24.344
- How do you like
spaghetti, Finch?

30:24.431 --> 30:25.258
- Nice.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.739
- Did I do something wrong?

30:31.090 --> 30:32.308
- No.

30:34.441 --> 30:35.224
No.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.502
- Come on, Toby.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.940
- Toby, it's easy.

I got some in my beard.

I'll save it for later.

- They've finally snapped.

- That kid is amazing.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.147
He took one look at the library

31:28.234 --> 31:29.888
and he got that expression

31:29.975 --> 31:32.064
that Jack gets when we
go to the pet store.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.023
- There are more books in there
than he ever knew existed.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.372
- He picked up my "Walden"

31:36.459 --> 31:38.200

Thoreau to me.

- [Janelle] Where is he now?

- Jack took him out
to the tree house.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.817
- Listen, I have something
to tell you all about Finch.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.212
CPS took him in, but
he has no place to go.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.432
Last night, he slept in a
jail cell at the station

31:52.519 --> 31:54.086
because they couldn't
place him anywhere.

31:54.173 --> 31:57.916
Today, they were gonna place
him with a known drug felon.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.787
To stop that from happening,

31:59.874 --> 32:01.789
I told them that we
were adopting him.

- What?

32:03.660 --> 32:04.400
- He's staying?

32:04.487 --> 32:05.445
- Not with us?

32:05.532 --> 32:07.012
- We're not really adopting him.

It's just a cover until I
can find him a safe family

32:09.492 --> 32:10.711

- How could you decide this

32:11.842 --> 32:13.279
without talking to me first?

32:13.366 --> 32:16.021
- There was no time
and he was in danger.

- I don't want him here.

- He's so weird.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.025

And it's just for
a little while.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.855

- At least with Jackson,

32:26.335 --> 32:28.033
you asked us before
we adopted him.

32:30.687 --> 32:31.950
- Keith, I'm sorry.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.299
- What were you
thinking, Janelle?

32:33.386 --> 32:34.778
- He needs my help.

- Sometimes I need
your help too.

becoming a writer is to me.

at the investment firm

supposed to be about that.

33:16.037 --> 33:16.559
- [Jackson] Mom.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.302
- Honey, how long have
you been standing there?

33:20.389 --> 33:22.391
- Not long, we came in
and get my walkie talkies

33:22.478 --> 33:24.045
to take to the tree house.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.177
- We?

33:25.264 --> 33:27.396
- Finch was here
too but he left.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.050
- You suppose he heard us?

33:29.137 --> 33:30.225
- Oh, he heard you.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.227
- I'd better go find him.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.576
- No, let me do it.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.013
- No, you go write.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.492
He's my responsibility.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.017
- No, I shouldn't
have said what I said.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.018
I'll talk to him.

33:42.368 --> 33:45.240
- Mom, are you and
dad mad at each other?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.025
- No, honey.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.027
We just had a
little disagreement.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.332
- About Finch?

33:50.419 --> 33:51.246
- Yeah.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.073
- I like him.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.423
- Yeah, me too.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.000
- [Keith] Finch, wait up.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.220
- You don't need to concern
yourself with me, Mr. Brennan.

34:08.307 --> 34:11.136
- Look Finch, about
what I said back there.

34:11.223 --> 34:14.052
- I just came over for
dinner because I was invited.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.966
I'm going home.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.533
- Briar Rock is a
long way from here.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.360
- I'll get there.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.015
- You know when you're hunting

34:21.102 --> 34:24.279
and you get focused
on the deer or rabbit

34:24.366 --> 34:26.281
and you don't see anything else?

34:26.368 --> 34:30.111
The woods around you
disappear, all sound stops,

34:30.198 --> 34:32.331
all you hear is your heartbeat,

34:32.418 --> 34:34.985
all you see is the slightest
movement of the prey?

34:38.685 --> 34:39.338
- Yeah.

34:41.079 --> 34:45.866
- That's how it is for my
brain right now about my book.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.955
I wasn't thinking
about anyone else.

34:49.696 --> 34:52.133
I didn't mean any
of those dumb things

34:52.220 --> 34:53.830
that I said back there.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.963
- I can take care of myself,

34:56.050 --> 34:57.660
but no one listens to me.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.010
- I believe that you can
take care of yourself,

35:00.098 --> 35:00.968
but you don't have to.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.754
It's too late to go
anywhere tonight.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.365
Come on back to
the house with me.

35:08.802 --> 35:09.759
- And stay with you?

35:11.109 --> 35:11.761
- Not permanently.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.114
Just until you know what
you want to do next.

35:16.201 --> 35:19.204
Hey, you can read "David
Copperfield" while you're there.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.468
What do you say, Finch?

35:22.555 --> 35:23.773
Just for a little while.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.474
- Did God tell you
to come after me

35:30.040 --> 35:33.522
or did you just decide
that on your own?

35:33.609 --> 35:35.133
- I'm not sure what you mean.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.528
- Whenever my gram had
a big decision to make,

35:39.615 --> 35:42.662
she would stop for a minute

35:42.749 --> 35:45.055
and she would get
real still and quiet

35:45.143 --> 35:47.928
and I knew that she was
praying to God in her head

35:48.015 --> 35:50.017
asking him what to do.

35:51.540 --> 35:55.065
And then she would get
this big smile on her face

35:55.153 --> 35:57.372
and she would have her answer.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.202
- It worked that
fast every time?

36:01.289 --> 36:04.031
- She said that because
she's a simple lady

36:04.118 --> 36:06.686
God usually kept the
answers pretty simple too.

36:08.209 --> 36:12.953
He often said yes
and no or we'll see.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.348
That's how she kept
on the right path.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.917
Is that how you do
it, Mr. Brennan?

36:22.397 --> 36:23.746
- Yeah, I guess.

36:25.226 --> 36:29.230
If I'm honest, I
usually jump in first

36:29.317 --> 36:31.101
and then ask God for
a bail out later.

36:33.365 --> 36:34.844
- That's not how I
do it, Mr. Brennan.

36:36.411 --> 36:39.458
- All right, let's do
it your gran's way.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.201
On the count of three,
we'll ask together.

36:44.114 --> 36:47.292
One, two, three.

36:58.216 --> 36:58.999
We'll see?

37:01.610 --> 37:02.350
- We'll see.

37:04.657 --> 37:05.745
- [Keith] Okay then.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.268
You know you should write down

37:07.355 --> 37:08.922
some of your memories
of your gran and pap.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.141
I'll bet you have some
interesting tales to tell.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.969
- [Finch] My gran once
took down a cougar

37:13.056 --> 37:13.970
with her knitting needles.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.798
- [Keith] That's what I thought.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.672
[knocking]

37:19.759 --> 37:22.501
- [Janelle] Toby, can I come in?

37:22.588 --> 37:23.328
- I'm really busy.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.765
I've got homework to do.

37:25.852 --> 37:27.419
[soft piano music]

37:27.506 --> 37:31.205
- Toby, I'm sorry the
way this all came out.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.946
I didn't mean to
spring this on you.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.426
- Where's dad?

37:34.513 --> 37:35.992
- He went to go find Finch.

37:36.906 --> 37:37.690
- Figures.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.868
- I think it would be
better if we talked.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.088
- There's nothing to talk about.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.743
- If you would
just open the door.

37:47.830 --> 37:48.527
- Goodnight, mom.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.486
- [Janelle] Toby please.

37:51.573 --> 37:52.487
- Goodnight.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.276
[gentle music]

38:54.723 --> 38:57.378
[dramatic music]

39:35.721 --> 39:36.548
- Who is it?

39:36.635 --> 39:37.766
- Miss Jessica Hague.

39:39.464 --> 39:40.552
- Yeah, what?

39:40.639 --> 39:41.944
- My name is Lane Billings.

39:42.031 --> 39:44.120
I'm with Alpha Gas Corp.

39:44.207 --> 39:47.080
- Do I look like I need
anything from a gas company?

39:47.167 --> 39:48.560
- I have some papers here

39:48.647 --> 39:51.301
that you might be
interested in reading.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.303
It could mean some
money for you.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.304
- Who do you think you are?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.002
I'm calling the police.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.918
- Oh, oh, oh no.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.616
I don't think you want the
police to come in there, do you?

40:01.703 --> 40:04.271
I mean, not with
what they would find.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.317
- You don't know
anything about me.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.710
[snaps finger]

40:12.148 --> 40:15.108
- Jessica Hague, 32
never been married,

40:15.195 --> 40:18.416
dropped out of Marsh
County High at 16.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.156
Your mother kicked
you out of your home

40:20.243 --> 40:23.029
when she discovered
you were pregnant.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.987
You bounced around from
friend's house to friend's house

40:25.074 --> 40:27.076
till you used them all up.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.035
Then you disappeared out
near Briar Rock Mountain

40:29.122 --> 40:31.341
for approximately three weeks,

40:31.429 --> 40:34.040
then resurfaced with
no job to speak of.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.521
Hmm, you've been busted
twice for possession,

40:36.608 --> 40:38.000
you like Will Ferrell comedies

40:38.087 --> 40:40.089
and your favorite
soda is Mountain Dew.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.444
Seems to me I know
you fairly well.

40:47.401 --> 40:48.489
- What do you want?

40:50.056 --> 40:52.798
- The real question
is what do you want?

40:53.755 --> 40:54.930
- What are you offering?

40:55.017 --> 40:56.758
- Security.

40:56.845 --> 40:59.108
Not to mention the
chance to see your son.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.329
- My son?

41:02.416 --> 41:03.069
- Mhmm.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.332
- You've seen my boy?

41:05.419 --> 41:06.638
- Mmhmm.

41:06.725 --> 41:07.421
- How is he?

41:07.508 --> 41:08.204
- Oh, he's fine.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.121
And you're both about
to do a lot better.

41:16.648 --> 41:19.041
[birds chirping]

41:22.262 --> 41:23.045
- Finch!

41:24.525 --> 41:26.396
Time for breakfast.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.225
- But I haven't
caught anything yet.

41:32.751 --> 41:35.841
- He's coming and he's
still wearing those clothes.

41:35.928 --> 41:37.451
- Stop worrying about it.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.583
- I'm going over to the Drake's.

41:38.670 --> 41:39.627
- I was hoping we all could-

41:39.714 --> 41:40.585
- No thanks.

41:40.672 --> 41:41.934
- What about breakfast?

41:42.021 --> 41:42.804
- I'm not hungry.

41:48.984 --> 41:50.116
- Morning, Finch.

41:50.203 --> 41:51.204
- Good morning.

41:53.206 --> 41:54.250
- Cool.

41:55.817 --> 41:56.514
- Is that?

42:00.474 --> 42:02.084
I hope you're hungry.

42:02.171 --> 42:03.869
- I am but I didn't
catch anything.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.435
- Oh, that's all right,

42:05.523 --> 42:07.568
I already went hunting
at the grocery store.

42:07.655 --> 42:08.569
- I want to go hunting.

42:08.656 --> 42:09.527
- Jackson.

42:11.224 --> 42:14.053
- Is that what you do
first thing every morning?

42:14.140 --> 42:16.098
- Mostly, sometimes I fish.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.186
- Can we go fishing?

42:17.273 --> 42:18.666
- Not today.

42:18.753 --> 42:20.102
Your father has his
writing deadlines

42:20.189 --> 42:21.800
so we're getting
out of the house.

42:21.887 --> 42:24.150
I was thinking we could go
to show Finch around town.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.152
What do you say, Finch?

42:26.239 --> 42:28.894
- Is there something
in particular you'd
like to see or do?

42:28.981 --> 42:30.286
- Can we go see a movie?

42:30.373 --> 42:31.853
- Yeah.
- A movie?

42:31.940 --> 42:32.724
- What do you say?

42:32.811 --> 42:34.203
Would you like that?

42:34.290 --> 42:36.815
- I think so, I've
never seen one before.

42:36.902 --> 42:38.294
- A movie it is then.

42:40.122 --> 42:44.474
- Mom, his clothes.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.609
- Let's do something
about it then.

46:00.409 --> 46:02.411
- Great Tiger,
thanks for asking.

46:02.498 --> 46:03.891
I've been at it all day.

46:03.978 --> 46:06.502
I've written about 20
pages of good stuff.

46:06.589 --> 46:07.677
I'm really happy with it.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.070
- Did you finish the book?

46:09.157 --> 46:11.029
- Not yet, but I'm really close.

46:11.116 --> 46:12.595
- I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.

46:12.682 --> 46:13.988
- And I have to go feed Lenny.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.338
- What about you, Finch?

46:16.425 --> 46:17.775
Did you have a good time?

46:17.862 --> 46:18.993
- It was mighty fine.

46:19.994 --> 46:21.517
And I'm tuckered out.

46:21.604 --> 46:24.912
Right now, I think I'll go
read my book and go to bed.

46:24.999 --> 46:28.698
- Oh, Finch, I found this
empty journal in the library.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.048
Thought you might want to use it

46:30.135 --> 46:31.005
to write down some
of your memories

46:31.092 --> 46:33.138
from Briar Rock Mountain.

46:33.225 --> 46:33.965
- Thank you.

46:35.488 --> 46:37.707
I will, I'll start on it tonight

46:37.795 --> 46:39.187
right after I finish

46:39.274 --> 46:40.580
the next chapter of
"David Copperfield".

46:40.667 --> 46:43.148
- Oh, the book is on
the desk in the library.

46:45.237 --> 46:47.805
- Ruth said that Toby left
their house right after lunch.

46:47.892 --> 46:48.980
- Did she say where he went?

46:49.067 --> 46:50.546
- She thought he
was coming here.

46:50.633 --> 46:53.114
I called his phone, it
went directly to voicemail.

46:53.201 --> 46:54.899
You don't think
anything happened?

46:54.986 --> 46:58.424
- No, I'm sure
he'll be home soon.

46:58.511 --> 47:00.600
- Okay, I'll make
a few more calls

47:00.687 --> 47:01.993
and see if anyone has seen him.

47:11.263 --> 47:13.743
[gentle music]

47:48.909 --> 47:50.171
[glass clinking]

47:50.258 --> 47:52.260
[sizzling]

47:56.047 --> 47:58.049
- Did you find your book?

47:58.136 --> 48:00.138
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what did you do?

48:00.225 --> 48:02.140
- [Finch] I knocked something
over and I touched this.

48:02.227 --> 48:03.402
- What did you touch?

48:03.489 --> 48:05.012
- Just this.
- Get up, get up.

48:06.709 --> 48:08.015
- Will it come back?

48:08.102 --> 48:10.061
- You had no business
touching this.

48:10.148 --> 48:11.540
- [Finch] I just wanted
to read your book.

48:11.627 --> 48:12.890
- And now it's gone.

48:14.239 --> 48:16.110
- I didn't mean to.
- Go.

48:16.197 --> 48:17.677
- I'm sorry.
- Go!

48:21.681 --> 48:22.769
- Finch?

48:22.856 --> 48:24.640
Keith, what was that all about?

48:24.727 --> 48:26.599
- He spilled water
all over the computer.

48:26.686 --> 48:27.643
It's fried.

48:27.730 --> 48:28.862
I lost everything.

48:28.949 --> 48:30.733
- Do you have a backup?

48:30.820 --> 48:32.257
- It has a backup drive in it.

48:32.344 --> 48:33.562
It may still work.

48:33.649 --> 48:34.607
- Call Uncle Jerry.

48:34.694 --> 48:35.738
He works in computers.

48:35.825 --> 48:37.088
- Yeah, he'll know what to do.

48:37.175 --> 48:39.394
- You call him, I'll clean up.

48:39.481 --> 48:40.569
- And where have you been?

48:40.656 --> 48:42.136
Your mother and I were worried.

48:42.223 --> 48:43.659
- I went over to Steve's.

48:43.746 --> 48:44.834
I forgot to call.

48:44.922 --> 48:45.792
Sorry.

48:45.879 --> 48:47.185
- When will you realize

48:47.272 --> 48:49.970
that sorry doesn't
magically fix everything?

48:50.057 --> 48:52.625
You should have called us
and told us where you were.

48:52.712 --> 48:54.322
- I just forgot.

48:54.409 --> 48:55.584
- Well, you won't forget this.

48:55.671 --> 48:57.282
You're grounded.

48:57.369 --> 48:59.284
One week, you're not leaving
this house except for school.

48:59.371 --> 49:01.025
Got it?

49:01.112 --> 49:02.809
- I got it.

49:17.824 --> 49:19.869
You know what this
means, don't you?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.132
- I didn't mean to.

49:21.219 --> 49:22.133
- If he loses that book,

49:22.220 --> 49:23.482
he'll be finished as a writer.

49:23.569 --> 49:25.223
- Finished?

49:25.310 --> 49:27.442
- You should have stayed on
that mountain where you belong.

49:27.529 --> 49:28.617
- Listen, I'm really sorry.

49:28.704 --> 49:30.054
I didn't know-

49:30.141 --> 49:31.446
- Dad never should have
let you in this house.

49:31.533 --> 49:33.840
He didn't want to,
but mom made him.

49:33.927 --> 49:35.973
- He asked me to stay.

49:36.060 --> 49:38.062
- What, you think
you wanted you here?

49:38.149 --> 49:39.367
The only reason he's
letting you stay

49:39.454 --> 49:41.021
is because mom promised
to get rid of you

49:41.108 --> 49:43.197
first thing Monday morning.

49:43.284 --> 49:46.244
You are not a part of this
family and you never will be.

49:50.465 --> 49:53.033
[dramatic music]

50:07.439 --> 50:09.136
- I need to get in.

50:14.663 --> 50:19.146
[crying]
[sad music]

51:28.650 --> 51:30.087
- Finch!

51:33.177 --> 51:35.048
Finch!

51:37.311 --> 51:38.399
Finch!

51:42.186 --> 51:44.013
Did you stay out here all night?

51:44.101 --> 51:45.102
What's this?

51:47.582 --> 51:49.323
- I did what you said.

51:49.410 --> 51:52.065
I wrote down memories
of gran and pap

51:52.152 --> 51:53.501
so I'll always have them.

51:54.589 --> 51:56.069
- Finch, this is really good.

51:57.984 --> 51:59.681
You're an excellent writer.

52:01.074 --> 52:02.684
- You think so?

52:02.771 --> 52:03.685
- Yeah, I do.

52:05.209 --> 52:08.081
- But we better get you
inside, warm you up.

52:08.168 --> 52:09.691
Janelle has some
breakfast ready.

52:11.171 --> 52:12.216
- I can't go back.

52:13.913 --> 52:15.175
I've caused too much trouble.

52:18.352 --> 52:20.615
- Well, you can't stay here.

52:20.702 --> 52:22.269
We'll figure it out.

52:22.356 --> 52:23.966
It might take us a little
longer than expected,

52:24.053 --> 52:25.316
but we'll find you a home.

52:36.762 --> 52:38.894
- [Toby] I told you to
stay out of my room.

52:38.981 --> 52:39.939
- [Jackson] I
wasn't in your room.

52:40.026 --> 52:41.462
- Boys.

52:41.549 --> 52:42.507
- [Toby] Then why is
my hoodie on your bed?

52:42.594 --> 52:44.117
- [Jackson] I don't know.

52:44.204 --> 52:46.032
- Mom, can I go to Sophie's?

52:46.119 --> 52:46.859
- Have you finished
sweeping the porch?

52:46.946 --> 52:47.990
- [Toby] Is that my hat?

52:48.077 --> 52:50.079
- [Jackson] Get out of my room.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.646
- Not yet, I'll do it after.

52:51.733 --> 52:53.082
- You know the rules.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.083
- [Toby] Give them to me.

52:54.171 --> 52:55.563
- Boys, keep it down.

52:55.650 --> 52:56.782
Not until your chores are done.

52:56.869 --> 52:58.436
- It'll be too late then.

52:58.523 --> 53:00.046
- Mom, Toby hit me.

53:00.133 --> 53:01.961
- I did not, you're such a baby.

53:02.048 --> 53:02.744
- Mom please.

53:02.831 --> 53:03.963
- Enough!

53:04.050 --> 53:05.573
Your dad is writing.

53:05.660 --> 53:08.010
Jack, go outside and play.

53:08.097 --> 53:10.012
Toby, go into Jack's room,

53:10.099 --> 53:12.014
get your things out of there
and apologize for hitting him.

53:12.101 --> 53:13.668
Lisa, chores first.

53:13.755 --> 53:14.626
- Okay.

53:14.713 --> 53:15.844
- I didn't touch him.

53:15.931 --> 53:17.890
- I never get to go anywhere.

53:17.977 --> 53:20.066
[scoffs]

53:22.329 --> 53:24.113
- What you doing?

53:24.201 --> 53:25.245
- Recollecting.

53:25.332 --> 53:26.855
- What's that mean?

53:26.942 --> 53:28.248
- It means I'm writing down

53:28.335 --> 53:30.032
things that happened
in the past.

53:30.119 --> 53:31.469
- Like stories?

53:31.556 --> 53:32.731
- Memories.

53:32.818 --> 53:34.080
- Will you tell me one?

53:34.167 --> 53:34.602
- Sure.

53:36.082 --> 53:38.476
- Lisa, Finch is
gonna tell me a story.

53:38.563 --> 53:39.955
You want to hear it?

53:40.042 --> 53:41.087
- Why not?

53:42.480 --> 53:45.222
- Well, this one is about

53:45.309 --> 53:48.312
when my gran was laid up in bed

53:48.399 --> 53:50.052
and pap had to make the lye soap

53:50.139 --> 53:51.489
by himself for the first time.

53:54.535 --> 53:56.102
- Will you look at that?

53:56.189 --> 53:58.800
- Yeah, they've been at
it for almost an hour now.

53:58.887 --> 54:00.193
- No arguing and fighting.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.934
- I know, I can't
believe it either.

54:03.457 --> 54:05.459
I just wish Toby was
out there with them.

54:06.547 --> 54:08.201
- What about us?

54:08.288 --> 54:09.942
Why aren't we out
there with them?

54:10.029 --> 54:11.073
- Good question.

54:12.205 --> 54:13.772
[laughing]

54:13.859 --> 54:15.904
I can't believe that
really happened.

54:15.991 --> 54:17.950
- Come on Finch, tell
them about the lye soap.

54:18.037 --> 54:19.299
That one's really funny.

54:19.386 --> 54:20.822
- Finch might need
to take a break.

54:20.909 --> 54:22.302
He's been at it for a while now.

54:22.389 --> 54:24.391
- I'm so glad you're
writing these down.

54:24.478 --> 54:26.306
These are priceless memories.

54:26.393 --> 54:28.569
- Well, my pap was
the storyteller.

54:28.656 --> 54:30.179
After dinner, we
would sit on the porch

54:30.267 --> 54:33.922
and he would weave gran
and I the wildest tales

54:34.009 --> 54:36.621
and we would laugh until
we had tears in our eyes.

54:36.708 --> 54:38.623
And he always swore
they were all true,

54:38.710 --> 54:40.277
but after he passed,

54:40.364 --> 54:42.104
gran told me that he
would just make them up

54:42.191 --> 54:43.280
while he was doing his chores.

54:44.846 --> 54:47.066
- You should write your
pap's stories down too.

54:47.153 --> 54:49.677
- You can make a whole
book out of them.

54:49.764 --> 54:51.244
- I think he would
have liked that.

54:51.331 --> 54:53.028
- [Janelle] I'm sure
he'd be so proud

54:53.115 --> 54:55.640
to know his stories are
still making people happy.

54:55.727 --> 54:57.946
- Looks like you're gonna
need some more journals

54:58.033 --> 54:59.600
or maybe a laptop computer.

54:59.687 --> 55:01.036
- No.

55:01.123 --> 55:03.082
Thank you, I will
stick to my pencils.

55:03.169 --> 55:05.432
[laughing]

55:07.086 --> 55:09.131
- Yes, that is correct.

55:13.397 --> 55:14.180
Uh huh.

55:17.139 --> 55:20.186
Yes, well, Marguerite.

55:20.273 --> 55:21.666
Hey, let me call you back.

55:22.797 --> 55:24.408
What are you doing here?

55:24.495 --> 55:27.324
- I know how eager you are to
find a placement for Finch.

55:27.411 --> 55:31.371
- Well, we were, but things
went really well this weekend.

55:31.458 --> 55:33.330
Keith and I talked
about it last night

55:33.417 --> 55:34.635
and if you can't find a family-

55:34.722 --> 55:35.984
- Oh but I already have,

55:36.071 --> 55:37.508
that's what I came
by to tell you.

55:37.595 --> 55:40.032
Finch's birth mother
contacted CPS.

55:40.119 --> 55:42.164
- His birth mother?

55:42.251 --> 55:43.340
But we don't know who she is?

55:43.427 --> 55:44.863
- We do now.

55:44.950 --> 55:47.126
She came by with two
attorneys and a full affidavit

55:47.213 --> 55:48.867
explaining everything
that happened

55:48.954 --> 55:50.869
down to the smallest detail.

55:50.956 --> 55:53.132
She's even consented
to a blood test.

55:53.219 --> 55:54.960
It's definitely her.

55:55.047 --> 55:57.876
And she wants full custody.

55:57.963 --> 56:00.008
So you and Keith
are off the hook.

56:00.095 --> 56:02.010
- Why is she showing up now?

56:02.097 --> 56:05.013
Where has she been
for the last 16 years?

56:05.100 --> 56:07.015
- I thought you'd
be happy about this.

56:07.102 --> 56:09.496
- She abandoned
him with strangers

56:09.583 --> 56:12.499
and didn't contact
him for 16 years.

56:12.586 --> 56:15.502
Excuse me for questioning
her character.

56:15.589 --> 56:17.069
- Oh, Janelle.

56:17.156 --> 56:20.115
Please tell me, you're not
gonna try and fight this.

56:20.202 --> 56:21.726
- And what happens if we do?

56:23.945 --> 56:25.991
- The judge would
hear both parties

56:26.078 --> 56:28.080
and make a determination.

56:28.167 --> 56:30.125
But I have to warn you, Janelle,

56:30.212 --> 56:34.260
the law heavily favors the birth
mother in these situations.

56:34.347 --> 56:35.435
- Well, I don't.

56:35.522 --> 56:37.132
- What happened?

56:37.219 --> 56:39.221
I thought that you wanted to
find a permanent home for him.

56:39.308 --> 56:40.614
- I do.

56:40.701 --> 56:42.790
I just want to make
sure it's the right one.

56:44.488 --> 56:45.576
[sighs]

56:54.236 --> 56:56.978
- Okay, so what
do we tell Finch?

56:57.065 --> 56:58.458
- Nothing for now.

56:58.545 --> 57:01.026
Anything could happen
before the judge's ruling?

57:01.113 --> 57:04.203
I mean she could decide
to disappear again.

57:04.290 --> 57:05.900
- It's better not
to get his hopes up

57:05.987 --> 57:08.163
until we know
something for certain.

57:08.250 --> 57:10.470
Will the judge let him stay
with us until the hearing?

57:10.557 --> 57:12.254
- Do you want him to?

57:12.341 --> 57:13.821
It could take weeks.

57:13.908 --> 57:15.301
- He's already here.

57:15.388 --> 57:17.085
We don't want to
move him around again

57:17.172 --> 57:19.174
and it's only for
a little while.

57:21.481 --> 57:24.745
- Are we crazy for
getting mixed up in this?

57:24.832 --> 57:27.095
- It's a little late
for that, isn't it?

57:27.182 --> 57:28.967
Could you walk
away from this now?

57:29.054 --> 57:32.579
- No.

57:32.666 --> 57:35.756
- Could you?

57:35.843 --> 57:37.149
- No.

57:37.236 --> 57:38.890
[soft music]

57:40.065 --> 57:41.458
- Thank you.

57:41.545 --> 57:42.328
- For what?

57:44.591 --> 57:47.246
- For just being you.

57:51.642 --> 57:53.034
- Did you pack my jello?

57:53.121 --> 57:54.906
- [Janelle] Strawberry,
it's in your bag.

57:54.993 --> 57:55.776
- Yes!

57:58.779 --> 58:01.129
- I'm going to Dina's after
school to do homework.

58:01.216 --> 58:02.174
- Will her mom be home?

58:02.261 --> 58:03.305
- [Lisa] Uh huh.

58:04.742 --> 58:06.526
- Drake's big
brother will be home.

58:06.613 --> 58:08.572
- Nice try but we
talked about this,

58:08.659 --> 58:10.661
straight home from school
to do your homework.

58:10.748 --> 58:13.011
You can play "Hunter's Watch"
with Drake next Saturday.

58:13.098 --> 58:14.534
- Lisa gets to go.

58:14.621 --> 58:16.188
- Sorry, that's
how it is for now.

58:19.147 --> 58:20.018
- Looking sharp.

58:21.846 --> 58:23.151
- First day of school
for Finch, mom,

58:23.238 --> 58:24.065
take a picture.

58:24.152 --> 58:25.545
- We're gonna be late.

58:25.632 --> 58:27.852
- Nope, Jack's right,
it's tradition.

58:27.939 --> 58:30.028
We always take a picture
of the first day of school.

58:30.115 --> 58:31.203
- It's not my first
day of school.

58:31.290 --> 58:32.378
I'll be in the car.

58:32.465 --> 58:33.814
- Toby.

58:33.901 --> 58:36.991
Okay, come on,
everybody, move in close.

58:40.038 --> 58:41.343
Got it.

58:41.430 --> 58:42.954
- Get in the car,
it's time to go.

58:48.916 --> 58:50.004
Are you ready for this?

58:50.091 --> 58:52.180
- I think so.

58:52.267 --> 58:54.269
I don't really know
what it will be like.

58:56.141 --> 58:57.359
- Just be yourself.

58:57.446 --> 58:59.013
Be friendly.

58:59.100 --> 59:01.059
Don't make too many A's
on your first day though.

59:01.146 --> 59:03.540
Lisa is accustomed to being
the smartest one in the family.

59:03.627 --> 59:05.106
- Oh stop.

59:05.193 --> 59:06.978
Don't be afraid to ask questions

59:07.065 --> 59:10.590
and remember Toby will be there
to help you find everything.

59:10.677 --> 59:11.765
- I'll be fine.

59:11.852 --> 59:13.027
Thank you.

59:13.114 --> 59:14.551
- Well, get in the car then.

59:14.638 --> 59:16.074
We can't be late
for your first day.

59:17.249 --> 59:19.773
[jaunty music]

59:32.612 --> 59:34.179
- I am sorry I'm late, youngins,

59:34.266 --> 59:36.921
but I lost my glasses
in the teacher's lounge.

59:37.008 --> 59:41.665
But fear not, I have another
pair here in my bag somewhere.

59:41.752 --> 59:44.145
Oh here they are,
a bit dirty but,

59:44.232 --> 59:45.843
we'll clean 'em up.

59:45.930 --> 59:49.629
Oh, it looks like the ground
flew up there for a minute.

59:49.716 --> 59:52.632
Oh, I hope you did
your reading for today

59:52.719 --> 59:55.243
because I'm gonna be passing
out a quiz on chapter 46.

59:55.330 --> 59:56.941
[groaning]

59:57.028 --> 1:00:01.598
Oh ooh, oh, we have a unique
new student with us today.

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:06.341
Join me in welcoming,
Mr. French Wagemaker.

1:00:07.125 --> 1:00:08.561
Mr. Wagemaker.

1:00:10.128 --> 1:00:12.173
French, why don't you
come up and join us

1:00:12.260 --> 1:00:13.871
so we all know who you are?

1:00:15.437 --> 1:00:17.614
[Whispers] They said he
might be a little slow.

1:00:19.224 --> 1:00:21.705
French, why don't you come
up to the front please?

1:00:22.662 --> 1:00:23.620
- Me?

1:00:23.707 --> 1:00:26.100
- Yes, come to the front please.

1:00:29.190 --> 1:00:32.106
Everybody, this is
French Wagemaker.

1:00:32.193 --> 1:00:34.543
He's never been to a
proper school before

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:36.197
on account of he
grew up on a mountain

1:00:36.284 --> 1:00:38.112
far away from normal people.

1:00:38.199 --> 1:00:40.071
[laughing]

1:00:40.158 --> 1:00:42.813
[Shouting] On a mountain, right?

1:00:44.162 --> 1:00:46.686
Well I'll be, isn't that nice?

1:00:46.773 --> 1:00:48.470
Oh, everybody join me

1:00:48.557 --> 1:00:51.473
in making French feel
at home in our school.

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:53.780
[clapping]

1:00:56.261 --> 1:00:59.133
[Shouting] You can
sit down now, honey.

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:00.439
[Laughter]
Sit.

1:01:02.136 --> 1:01:05.052
As soon as we read the quote
of the day up on the board,

1:01:05.139 --> 1:01:07.751
we'll jump right into that quiz.

1:01:07.838 --> 1:01:08.665
All righty then.

1:01:10.231 --> 1:01:13.365
Oh since this is French's
very first day with us,

1:01:13.452 --> 1:01:16.150
why don't we have him
read the quote of the day

1:01:16.237 --> 1:01:19.110
and give us his opinion?

1:01:19.197 --> 1:01:23.288
[Shouting] French, read aloud
the quote for us, please.

1:01:25.203 --> 1:01:28.162
[students laughing]

1:01:31.078 --> 1:01:32.471
Oh boy.

1:01:32.558 --> 1:01:35.604
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to embarrass you, honey.

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:38.085
They told me you could read.

1:01:38.172 --> 1:01:39.957
[laughing]

1:01:40.044 --> 1:01:42.089
- No school should ever
try to serve meatloaf.

1:01:42.176 --> 1:01:44.962
- I swear, Miss Davenport's
trying to kill us.

1:01:45.049 --> 1:01:47.486
- So where is he?

1:01:47.573 --> 1:01:49.357
- He went to go
find the bathroom.

1:01:49.444 --> 1:01:52.143
- Yeah, but that
was 20 minutes ago.

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:53.274
- This is ridiculous.

1:01:53.361 --> 1:01:55.189
We have to babysit him all day.

1:01:55.276 --> 1:01:57.496
- I'm not babysitting anyone.

1:01:57.583 --> 1:01:58.540
- Thanks for the help.

1:01:58.627 --> 1:02:01.152
- Hey, he seems like a nice guy.

1:02:01.239 --> 1:02:03.197
Maybe a little clueless.

1:02:03.284 --> 1:02:04.633
- A little brainless, too.

1:02:06.548 --> 1:02:09.290
- Hey, are you
really a hillbilly?

1:02:09.377 --> 1:02:11.292
- I don't really
know what that is.

1:02:11.379 --> 1:02:12.990
- Don't be rude.
- What?

1:02:13.077 --> 1:02:13.991
- How long did
you live up there?

1:02:14.078 --> 1:02:14.905
- On the mountain?

1:02:14.992 --> 1:02:16.428
I was born there.

1:02:16.515 --> 1:02:18.082
- So was their an entire
village of mountain people

1:02:18.169 --> 1:02:18.996
or just you?

1:02:19.083 --> 1:02:20.824
- Just me and my gran.

1:02:20.911 --> 1:02:22.739
- Did you grow up wearing
nothing but a loincloth

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:23.652
like Tarzan?

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:24.653
- I didn't-

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.220
- You didn't have a loincloth?

1:02:26.307 --> 1:02:28.440
- Cut it out, guys.

1:02:28.527 --> 1:02:31.008
- What, does he
have a fan club now?

1:02:31.095 --> 1:02:32.574
- People are just curious.

1:02:32.661 --> 1:02:35.099
- He grew up in the
woods, big deal.

1:02:35.186 --> 1:02:38.406
- Uh oh, someone sounds
a little jealous.

1:02:38.493 --> 1:02:40.104
- Don't start with me, man.

1:02:40.191 --> 1:02:42.280
- You don't know who
Tarzan is, do you?

1:02:42.367 --> 1:02:43.803
- No.

1:02:43.890 --> 1:02:47.024
- So have you ever been
on the internet before?

1:02:47.111 --> 1:02:48.852
- I have a fishing net.

1:02:48.939 --> 1:02:50.462
My pap and I made it.

1:02:50.549 --> 1:02:51.680
- Pap?

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:52.725
He's got a pap.

1:02:52.812 --> 1:02:53.900
- Well, actually-

1:02:53.987 --> 1:02:55.293
- That is so hillbilly.

1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:57.774
- So did you fish
and hunt for food?

1:02:57.861 --> 1:02:59.123
- That's cool.

1:02:59.210 --> 1:03:01.081
I mean, it's crazy,
but it's cool.

1:03:01.168 --> 1:03:02.126
- How is that cool?

1:03:02.213 --> 1:03:03.823
- Well, maybe not to you, Caleb,

1:03:03.910 --> 1:03:06.173
but you wouldn't last more
than five minutes in the wild.

1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:08.262
- Shut up.
- That's so true, though.

1:03:08.349 --> 1:03:09.481
- Thanks for talking with me.

1:03:09.568 --> 1:03:11.135
Nice to meet you all.

1:03:20.274 --> 1:03:22.102
- Hurry up, you're
gonna make us late.

1:03:25.018 --> 1:03:26.759
- What do you have on your arm?

1:03:26.846 --> 1:03:28.848
- It's my locker combination.

1:03:28.935 --> 1:03:30.894
A girl wrote it on there for me.

1:03:30.981 --> 1:03:33.113
- That's not a
locker combination.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:33.940
- Hurry up and get changed.

1:03:34.027 --> 1:03:35.028
We have PE next.

1:03:37.030 --> 1:03:39.206
See what I mean, babysitting.

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:41.861
He's fine.

1:03:41.948 --> 1:03:42.731
- Hold up.

1:03:43.907 --> 1:03:45.125
- You don't need to do that.

1:03:49.086 --> 1:03:50.087
- Bring your gym clothes.

1:03:50.174 --> 1:03:51.915
We are running today.

1:03:53.264 --> 1:03:54.656
Are you fast?

1:03:54.743 --> 1:03:56.093
- I think so.

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:59.052
My gran and I never
really raced much.

1:03:59.139 --> 1:04:01.315
- Well, Toby's been the
fastest kid in our class

1:04:01.402 --> 1:04:02.882
since fifth grade.

1:04:02.969 --> 1:04:04.492
It's about time
somebody beat him.

1:04:06.016 --> 1:04:07.452
- What makes you
think he can beat me?

1:04:07.539 --> 1:04:09.193
- I don't know.

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.412
This guy has been running around
a mountain his whole life.

1:04:11.499 --> 1:04:13.588
We spent six hours
playing "Hunter's Watch"

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:16.200
and eating potato
chips last Saturday.

1:04:16.287 --> 1:04:17.636
I'd bet money on him.

1:04:19.681 --> 1:04:21.118
- That's everyone,
Coach Winklevoss.

1:04:21.205 --> 1:04:23.772
- All right, runners.

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.165
Let's go.

1:04:25.252 --> 1:04:26.993
Let's get those
legs stretched out.

1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:28.995
[grumbling]

1:04:29.082 --> 1:04:31.519
And I don't want to
hear any complaining.

1:04:31.606 --> 1:04:33.608
Today is a beautiful
day for running.

1:04:47.361 --> 1:04:50.016
Okay, how do we feel back there?

1:04:50.103 --> 1:04:51.583
[grumbling]

1:04:51.670 --> 1:04:54.194
Since it's a new month,
we have a new challenge.

1:04:54.281 --> 1:04:57.328
The student who has the
fastest cumulative time

1:04:57.415 --> 1:04:59.156
in the 100 meter dash

1:04:59.243 --> 1:05:03.116
will win four tickets
to the Cineplex Theater.

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:04.988
[Grumbling]
[Kid] Just four?

1:05:05.075 --> 1:05:07.120
What, you don't like movies?

1:05:07.207 --> 1:05:09.427
- You may as well
hand them to Toby now.

1:05:09.514 --> 1:05:11.298
Save us all a lot
of embarrassment.

1:05:11.385 --> 1:05:12.734
[Girl] Yeah, it'd save time.

1:05:12.821 --> 1:05:14.475
- Oh, come on now.

1:05:14.562 --> 1:05:16.216
That's the wrong attitude.

1:05:16.303 --> 1:05:17.261
You gotta work for it.

1:05:18.349 --> 1:05:20.394
Strive to be better every day.

1:05:21.656 --> 1:05:22.483
[whistle blowing]

1:05:22.570 --> 1:05:23.397
Line 'em up, people.

1:05:23.484 --> 1:05:25.182
First group of five.

1:05:25.269 --> 1:05:27.924
[upbeat music]

1:05:40.023 --> 1:05:40.762
- On your marks,

1:05:42.068 --> 1:05:43.287
get set,
[dramatic music]

1:05:43.374 --> 1:05:44.201
go.

1:05:44.288 --> 1:05:47.073
[kids cheering]

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:49.032
- You can do it, Finch.

1:05:51.643 --> 1:05:53.993
- Come on Toby,
you can take him.

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.517
[upbeat music]

1:05:56.604 --> 1:06:00.434
[crowd shouts disapprovingly]

1:06:04.221 --> 1:06:05.309
- [Girl] Are you okay?

1:06:05.396 --> 1:06:06.353
- Easy, easy.

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:07.833
- [Girl] Oh my gosh, okay, okay.

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:09.313
It's gonna be okay.
- Let's lift him up.

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:13.534
Okay, stand, there you
go, up, easy, okay.

1:06:13.621 --> 1:06:14.883
Here we go.

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:15.884
Here we go.

1:06:17.843 --> 1:06:19.279
- What kind of cheap
shot was that, dude?

1:06:19.366 --> 1:06:20.150
- We just bumped.

1:06:20.237 --> 1:06:21.238
It happens.

1:06:22.239 --> 1:06:23.544
- Don't worry, kids,

1:06:23.631 --> 1:06:24.981
I think he'll be okay.

1:06:25.068 --> 1:06:25.982
- What?

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:26.983
- [Girl] What was that?

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:27.679
- I won fair and square.

1:06:27.766 --> 1:06:28.593
- Jerk move.

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:29.681
- It was an accident.

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:33.685
What's their problem?

1:06:33.772 --> 1:06:34.555
Where are you going?

1:06:34.642 --> 1:06:36.035
- I'm going to make sure

1:06:36.122 --> 1:06:38.124
he knows where the
bathroom is this time.

1:06:38.211 --> 1:06:40.300
Try not to kick anyone
else while I'm gone.

1:06:48.613 --> 1:06:51.355
- Look at you,
hitting the books.

1:06:51.442 --> 1:06:53.096
- Not like I have a choice.

1:06:53.183 --> 1:06:54.532
I'm grounded, remember?

1:06:57.013 --> 1:06:57.796
- I do.

1:07:05.151 --> 1:07:07.066
You know, I was thinking,

1:07:07.153 --> 1:07:10.287
next weekend, maybe
we should go camping.

1:07:10.374 --> 1:07:13.029
Get some fresh air,
clear our heads a bit.

1:07:14.117 --> 1:07:15.074
- Really?

1:07:15.161 --> 1:07:17.294
- Yeah, it's been a long time.

1:07:17.381 --> 1:07:19.600
I could finally teach
you how to fish.

1:07:19.687 --> 1:07:22.212
- Yeah, okay.

1:07:22.299 --> 1:07:24.692
- My rods are too
big for Jack, though.

1:07:24.779 --> 1:07:27.086
We'll have to stop and pick
up a smaller one for him.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.567
- Jack?

1:07:29.654 --> 1:07:31.177
- Though Finch says he
makes his own fishing rods

1:07:31.264 --> 1:07:32.787
out of tree branches.

1:07:32.874 --> 1:07:34.224
He could teach us
how to do that.

1:07:34.311 --> 1:07:35.877
- I can't.

1:07:35.964 --> 1:07:37.836
I told Drake I'd
meet him on Saturday.

1:07:37.923 --> 1:07:39.316
- Oh, come on.

1:07:39.403 --> 1:07:40.969
You can't miss a few
hours of video games

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:42.884
for a camping trip
with your family?

1:07:42.971 --> 1:07:43.755
- Family?

1:07:44.756 --> 1:07:46.192
- You know what?

1:07:46.279 --> 1:07:47.585
I'm getting tired
of your attitude.

1:07:47.672 --> 1:07:49.326
You are part of a family

1:07:49.413 --> 1:07:50.762
and being part of a family

1:07:50.849 --> 1:07:53.417
means you take time and
invest in your family.

1:07:53.504 --> 1:07:54.896
- I'm going to
finish in my room.

1:07:54.983 --> 1:07:56.681
- No, you're always
hiding in your room.

1:07:56.768 --> 1:07:59.249
You need to be down here
interacting with the rest of us.

1:07:59.336 --> 1:08:02.165
It's not so healthy for you to
be so isolated all the time.

1:08:02.252 --> 1:08:03.949
- Oh, so now I'm not
healthy, is that it?

1:08:04.036 --> 1:08:06.343
- I just want you to
make a stronger effort

1:08:06.430 --> 1:08:08.345
to be part of the
family, that's all.

1:08:08.432 --> 1:08:10.782
- Sorry to be such a
disappointment to you.

1:08:10.869 --> 1:08:13.785
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

1:08:13.872 --> 1:08:15.656
That is not how I feel.

1:08:15.743 --> 1:08:17.005
You are my son.

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:18.529
- Just not the one you wanted.

1:08:18.616 --> 1:08:20.226
- What?

1:08:20.313 --> 1:08:22.010
- That's why you went out and
found another one, isn't it?

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:23.534
That's why you went
out and got Jack,

1:08:23.621 --> 1:08:25.710
only I guess he didn't
fit the bill either.

1:08:25.797 --> 1:08:26.667
- Is that what you think?

1:08:26.754 --> 1:08:28.060
- Now you've got Finch.

1:08:28.147 --> 1:08:29.627
You've finally found
your kind of kid.

1:08:29.714 --> 1:08:30.671
Now you guys can go fishing

1:08:30.758 --> 1:08:32.238
and write best sellers together.

1:08:32.325 --> 1:08:33.326
- Toby.

1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:37.069
[phone ringing]

1:08:38.288 --> 1:08:39.593
Yeah?

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:40.855
- [Janelle] Keith,
we have a problem.

1:08:42.335 --> 1:08:43.380
- Come on, Drake.

1:08:43.467 --> 1:08:44.511
You can't get out of it?

1:08:44.598 --> 1:08:46.122
We've had this plan for awhile.

1:08:47.993 --> 1:08:51.997
Okay look, this isn't about
what happened at school, right?

1:08:53.955 --> 1:08:56.001
Yeah, no, I get it.

1:08:56.088 --> 1:08:57.263
Maybe a movie on Sunday?

1:08:59.352 --> 1:09:01.137
Yeah, sure, some
other time then.

1:09:07.752 --> 1:09:09.580
[Dramatic music]

1:09:30.818 --> 1:09:32.168
- Marguerite.

1:09:32.255 --> 1:09:33.995
- Janelle.

1:09:34.082 --> 1:09:36.041
- Listen, there's
something wrong here.

1:09:36.128 --> 1:09:38.261
Something is off about
this whole thing.

1:09:38.348 --> 1:09:41.568
- Look Janelle, this really
isn't your call to make.

1:09:41.655 --> 1:09:44.136
Finch's mother insisted
on temporary custody

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:45.529
until the hearing.

1:09:45.616 --> 1:09:46.660
The judge is granting it.

1:09:46.747 --> 1:09:48.314
- But why so fast?

1:09:48.401 --> 1:09:51.230
She hasn't shown any interest
in him since he was born

1:09:51.317 --> 1:09:54.015
and now all of a sudden she
can't live a day without him.

1:09:54.102 --> 1:09:56.017
- Maybe she didn't
know where he was.

1:09:56.104 --> 1:09:58.194
- He was right where
she abandoned him.

1:09:58.281 --> 1:10:00.892
- Maybe she finally has
her life in a good place

1:10:00.979 --> 1:10:02.850
and can support him.

1:10:02.937 --> 1:10:03.982
- Has she been in jail?

1:10:05.113 --> 1:10:06.506
- You know I can't answer that.

1:10:06.593 --> 1:10:09.205
- But you said she came
here with two attorneys.

1:10:09.292 --> 1:10:12.338
Who hires two attorneys for
a family custody hearing?

1:10:12.425 --> 1:10:14.688
- I can't say anything more.

1:10:14.775 --> 1:10:17.038
- She's either ridiculously rich

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:20.346
or someone else is helping
her out, a family member.

1:10:20.433 --> 1:10:22.435
- Janelle, I cannot
talk to you about this.

1:10:22.522 --> 1:10:24.002
- How was she dressed?

1:10:24.089 --> 1:10:25.264
Was she really put together?

1:10:25.351 --> 1:10:26.744
- Janelle.

1:10:26.831 --> 1:10:28.267
- I'm not asking for
state secrets here.

1:10:28.354 --> 1:10:30.487
I'm asking you woman to woman.

1:10:30.574 --> 1:10:32.053
Did she look like she had money?

1:10:33.403 --> 1:10:35.100
- No.

1:10:35.187 --> 1:10:39.060
- Then how can she hire
a team of attorneys?

1:10:39.147 --> 1:10:40.975
- Are we done here, detective?

1:10:42.194 --> 1:10:43.326
- Yeah.

1:10:43.413 --> 1:10:45.328
No one more thing.

1:10:45.415 --> 1:10:47.025
When she came into your office,

1:10:47.112 --> 1:10:50.333
was she calm and composed
or fidgety and nervous?

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:53.031
- I'd say more nervous,
but that's not uncommon.

1:10:53.118 --> 1:10:56.817
- Okay, a picture is
starting to take shape here.

1:10:56.904 --> 1:10:59.037
The mother is not driving this.

1:10:59.124 --> 1:11:02.214
The attorneys are bringing
her along, but why?

1:11:02.301 --> 1:11:04.608
- I'm leaving now.

1:11:04.695 --> 1:11:07.654
Who would stand to gain
anything monetarily

1:11:07.741 --> 1:11:09.830
from Finch living
with his mother?

1:11:09.917 --> 1:11:11.267
He has nothing of value.

1:11:11.354 --> 1:11:13.094
Believe me, I saw the cabin.

1:11:17.664 --> 1:11:21.015
Marguerite, did the
Whittaker's own the land

1:11:21.102 --> 1:11:24.932
up on Briar Rock or were
they just squatters?

1:11:25.019 --> 1:11:26.282
- I have no idea.

1:11:27.457 --> 1:11:29.067
- It's time to do some digging.

1:11:30.416 --> 1:11:32.549
- We never had
this conversation.

1:11:34.464 --> 1:11:36.988
- If two women discussing
another woman's
outfit is illegal,

1:11:37.075 --> 1:11:40.034
half the women in the world
would be in jail right now.

1:11:40.121 --> 1:11:43.603
- Remind me to never
get on your bad side.

1:12:00.925 --> 1:12:03.449
[ominous music]

1:12:17.811 --> 1:12:19.204
- The treehouse.

1:12:20.248 --> 1:12:22.729
[dark music]

1:12:38.049 --> 1:12:39.659
What are you doing?

1:12:39.746 --> 1:12:42.009
- Just burning some trash.

1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:46.666
- My bird, it was on the porch.

1:12:46.753 --> 1:12:47.493
Have you seen it?

1:12:49.887 --> 1:12:50.757
- Why are you here?

1:12:52.237 --> 1:12:53.020
This isn't your home.

1:12:54.935 --> 1:12:57.851
The worst day of my life is
the day you showed up here.

1:12:57.938 --> 1:12:59.331
If it weren't for you,

1:12:59.418 --> 1:13:01.681
the kids at school
wouldn't be mad at me,

1:13:01.768 --> 1:13:03.814
Drake wouldn't be mad at me,

1:13:03.901 --> 1:13:05.381
Dad would still have his book.

1:13:07.295 --> 1:13:09.123
The bird made a good starter.

1:13:13.084 --> 1:13:14.999
- That was my gran's bird.

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:18.350
Why would you do that?

1:13:18.437 --> 1:13:20.221
- I had to start the
fire with something.

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:23.137
How else could I burn your book?

1:13:24.835 --> 1:13:26.706
- You burned my journal?

1:13:26.793 --> 1:13:28.795
- Only seemed fair that if
Dad should lose his book,

1:13:28.882 --> 1:13:30.580
you should lose yours.

1:13:32.277 --> 1:13:33.626
Come on hillbilly, hit me.

1:13:35.149 --> 1:13:36.977
Let's show everyone what
you're really made of.

1:13:38.022 --> 1:13:40.198
What, you miss your family?

1:13:41.242 --> 1:13:43.593
Now you know how I feel.

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:44.594
- No, I don't.

1:13:46.204 --> 1:13:47.510
My family was taken from me.

1:13:48.989 --> 1:13:50.991
You're just walking
away from yours.

1:13:52.166 --> 1:13:54.691
[dark music]

1:13:58.042 --> 1:13:59.435
[fire crackling]

1:14:32.685 --> 1:14:34.078
- Finch!
- Finch!

1:14:36.210 --> 1:14:37.821
- [Janelle] Finch!

1:14:56.753 --> 1:14:58.972
- Hey Finch, can we talk
to you for a minute?

1:15:00.583 --> 1:15:01.279
- Sure.

1:15:02.672 --> 1:15:06.023
- I received some information.

1:15:07.111 --> 1:15:08.286
It's about your mother.

1:15:09.113 --> 1:15:11.158
- My mom?

1:15:11.245 --> 1:15:13.770
- She came to CPS
looking for you.

1:15:13.857 --> 1:15:16.337
She's very interested
in meeting you.

1:15:16.424 --> 1:15:17.208
- She did?

1:15:18.862 --> 1:15:21.168
- Now we don't know
anything about her

1:15:21.255 --> 1:15:23.083
and we're not sure why
she's back right now,

1:15:23.170 --> 1:15:25.129
but we thought it'd be good

1:15:25.216 --> 1:15:27.566
if you met her and hear
what she had to say.

1:15:29.394 --> 1:15:32.266
- She wants you to come
live with her, Finch.

1:15:36.183 --> 1:15:36.923
- [Keith] Are you okay?

1:15:38.925 --> 1:15:40.536
- Live with my mom?

1:15:40.623 --> 1:15:43.016
- Yes, but nothing is definite.

1:15:43.103 --> 1:15:45.105
If you meet her and don't
want to go with her,

1:15:45.192 --> 1:15:47.151
we will fight it with
everything we have.

1:15:47.238 --> 1:15:48.239
- We don't want you
to live with her

1:15:48.326 --> 1:15:49.675
unless it's what you want.

1:15:53.505 --> 1:15:54.288
- Okay.

1:15:57.117 --> 1:15:58.336
When will I see her?

1:16:00.817 --> 1:16:01.992
- Tomorrow.

1:16:02.079 --> 1:16:02.993
- Tomorrow?

1:16:05.082 --> 1:16:09.042
I have school tomorrow and
I have to get homework done

1:16:09.129 --> 1:16:12.393
and I promised Jack I'd make
him a table for the tree house.

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.352
- I know it's a
lot to think about.

1:16:14.439 --> 1:16:17.137
- You don't have to
decide anything right now.

1:16:17.224 --> 1:16:19.313
You can take your time
and think about it.

1:16:22.839 --> 1:16:23.579
- Yeah.

1:16:28.148 --> 1:16:30.716
Can I be alone for a minute?

1:16:30.803 --> 1:16:32.588
- Yes, of course.

1:16:51.650 --> 1:16:54.697
So it turns out the
Whittaker's weren't squatters.

1:16:54.784 --> 1:16:57.177
They owned the 125 acres of land

1:16:57.264 --> 1:16:59.179
on top of Briar Rock Mountain.

1:16:59.266 --> 1:17:01.921
Jeremiah Whitaker
inherited it in 1952

1:17:02.008 --> 1:17:04.358
and now it belongs to Finch,

1:17:04.445 --> 1:17:07.274
well to his guardian
anyway, until he turns 18.

1:17:07.361 --> 1:17:09.059
- Oh, that's great.

1:17:09.146 --> 1:17:11.017
That much land must be worth
a couple hundred thousand

1:17:11.104 --> 1:17:11.975
in today's money.

1:17:12.062 --> 1:17:14.107
- Try 2.5 million.

1:17:14.194 --> 1:17:15.805
- Million?

1:17:15.892 --> 1:17:17.284
- That's how much Alpha Gas
offered the Whittakers for it

1:17:17.371 --> 1:17:18.808
before they died.

1:17:18.895 --> 1:17:20.984
Apparently that land
is prime for fracking.

1:17:21.071 --> 1:17:23.987
- Finch is worth $2.5 million?

1:17:24.074 --> 1:17:27.599
- No, his guardian
is until he turns 18.

1:17:27.686 --> 1:17:28.948
And guess who knows about it?

1:17:29.035 --> 1:17:29.819
- No.

1:17:29.906 --> 1:17:31.168
- Enter his mother,

1:17:31.255 --> 1:17:33.692
armed to the teeth
with expensive lawyers.

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:35.128
- Poor Finch.

1:17:35.215 --> 1:17:36.782
- Judge Raymond is
gonna get an earful

1:17:36.869 --> 1:17:38.175
about this at the hearing.

1:17:38.262 --> 1:17:40.133
- You can't say
anything about this.

1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:41.787
- I most certainly can.

1:17:41.874 --> 1:17:43.484
- No, you can't.

1:17:43.571 --> 1:17:44.747
Think about Finch.

1:17:44.834 --> 1:17:46.313
What would it do to him?

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:48.185
His mother comes
back into his life

1:17:48.272 --> 1:17:51.362
and you're going to tell him
she's only here for his money?

1:17:51.449 --> 1:17:53.059
And what if she isn't?

1:17:53.146 --> 1:17:55.061
- Why else would she
suddenly show up?

1:17:55.148 --> 1:17:57.020
- We don't really
know why she's back.

1:17:57.107 --> 1:17:58.674
She may really want
to be with him.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:01.764
We can't interfere
in their relationship

1:18:01.851 --> 1:18:03.200
based solely on a hunch.

1:18:03.287 --> 1:18:05.855
- Keith, I don't
want her to hurt him.

1:18:05.942 --> 1:18:08.335
- We may not be
able to stop that.

1:18:08.422 --> 1:18:10.860
- Well I can't just stand
by and let it happen.

1:18:11.991 --> 1:18:13.166
What is that?

1:18:13.253 --> 1:18:14.167
What are you looking at?

1:18:14.254 --> 1:18:15.603
- Toby's grades.

1:18:15.691 --> 1:18:17.344
He's failing three classes.

1:18:19.956 --> 1:18:23.699
- He's pulling away from
everything, school, us.

1:18:23.786 --> 1:18:25.048
- It's my fault.

1:18:25.135 --> 1:18:26.179
He thinks I'm
disappointed in him.

1:18:26.266 --> 1:18:27.572
- But that's not true.

1:18:27.659 --> 1:18:29.443
- I know, but I
haven't done enough

1:18:29.530 --> 1:18:30.706
to convince him otherwise.

1:18:32.403 --> 1:18:35.580
- Sometimes it's hard for
him to let people love him.

1:18:35.667 --> 1:18:38.061
He's always been so
critical of himself.

1:18:39.410 --> 1:18:41.325
He's like his father that way.

1:18:44.589 --> 1:18:45.546
You'll talk to him?

1:18:47.679 --> 1:18:48.462
- Yeah.

1:18:52.118 --> 1:18:53.903
[Crickets chirping]

1:18:56.862 --> 1:18:59.430
- [Lisa] I don't think you're
supposed to be up there.

1:19:00.823 --> 1:19:03.347
- I think better up here.

1:19:03.434 --> 1:19:05.088
- Thinking about your mom?

1:19:08.656 --> 1:19:11.485
Do you remember
anything about her?

1:19:11.572 --> 1:19:13.139
- Not really.

1:19:13.226 --> 1:19:17.753
Every time that I think
that I can see her face,

1:19:18.797 --> 1:19:20.016
I wonder if it's really her.

1:19:21.931 --> 1:19:24.150
Maybe it's just something
I'm making up in my head.

1:19:25.586 --> 1:19:27.066
- Are you going
to live with her?

1:19:29.895 --> 1:19:30.853
- I guess that I should.

1:19:32.289 --> 1:19:33.638
- You could just
stay here with us.

1:19:33.725 --> 1:19:34.639
Mom and dad would let you,

1:19:34.726 --> 1:19:35.683
I heard them say so.

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:37.250
- They did?

1:19:37.337 --> 1:19:38.991
- Sure, just tell them
that's what you want.

1:19:39.078 --> 1:19:41.602
- You see, that's the problem,

1:19:41.689 --> 1:19:43.735
it's not about what I want,

1:19:45.128 --> 1:19:47.434
it's about what
God wants for me.

1:19:47.521 --> 1:19:49.393
- Doesn't God care
how you feel about it?

1:19:51.438 --> 1:19:53.223
- Well I reckon he does.

1:19:55.355 --> 1:19:58.968
But he knows what's best
for me better than I do.

1:20:00.578 --> 1:20:02.188
- Well, I'm gonna tell
him it makes you sad

1:20:02.275 --> 1:20:05.148
and all he has to do to
fix it is let you stay.

1:20:05.235 --> 1:20:06.410
Then you'll be happy again.

1:20:09.239 --> 1:20:11.632
- Sometimes he chooses
not to fix things

1:20:13.069 --> 1:20:14.635
and I have to be
okay with that too.

1:20:16.072 --> 1:20:18.074
- Even if it means
you have to leave?

1:20:20.728 --> 1:20:22.078
- Whatever it means.

1:20:25.124 --> 1:20:28.171
I've put my trust in
Jesus my whole life.

1:20:29.172 --> 1:20:30.521
He hasn't let me down yet.

1:20:33.524 --> 1:20:35.221
If he says that I need to go,

1:20:37.049 --> 1:20:38.442
then I should joyfully.

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:43.055
- Is this one of those trials
that makes you stronger?

1:20:47.494 --> 1:20:49.801
- I think so.

1:20:49.888 --> 1:20:51.281
- I don't like them very much.

1:20:53.457 --> 1:20:56.286
[sad music]

1:20:56.373 --> 1:20:57.374
- Me neither.

1:21:06.296 --> 1:21:08.472
- Hey, are you still
okay with this?

1:21:08.559 --> 1:21:09.865
- Yes ma'am.

1:21:09.952 --> 1:21:11.562
- If you need anything,
we're right here.

1:21:11.649 --> 1:21:12.868
We're not going anywhere.

1:21:12.955 --> 1:21:14.347
- Anytime you want to leave,

1:21:14.434 --> 1:21:16.132
just let us know and
we'll come get you.

1:21:17.263 --> 1:21:19.396
- Thank you both for everything.

1:21:23.835 --> 1:21:25.881
- [Keith] Come on, let's
move a little further away.

1:21:25.968 --> 1:21:27.447
- No, he might need us.

1:21:27.534 --> 1:21:30.015
- We can't just stand
here and stare at them.

1:21:30.102 --> 1:21:31.364
- He might need us.

1:21:32.844 --> 1:21:33.627
- There's a bench over there.

1:21:33.714 --> 1:21:34.672
Come on.

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:47.990
- Oh, I never dreamed you'd
get so tall and handsome.

1:21:48.077 --> 1:21:48.599
Look at you.

1:21:50.122 --> 1:21:52.255
I've missed so much
of your growing up.

1:21:52.342 --> 1:21:53.865
- Why don't we step over here

1:21:53.952 --> 1:21:55.084
and let them speak
alone for a moment?

1:21:55.171 --> 1:21:56.476
- It's all right.

1:21:56.563 --> 1:21:59.001
Mr. Billings and his
associate represent me.

1:21:59.088 --> 1:22:01.481
- You need attorneys
to speak with your son?

1:22:01.568 --> 1:22:03.092
- Of course not.

1:22:03.179 --> 1:22:05.921
I just say the silliest
things sometimes.

1:22:06.008 --> 1:22:07.879
And I wouldn't want
to say or do anything

1:22:07.966 --> 1:22:10.969
that might mess up my chances
of getting my baby boy back.

1:22:24.243 --> 1:22:27.029
- I haven't been a
baby for a long time.

1:22:27.116 --> 1:22:28.508
- Of course you haven't.

1:22:28.595 --> 1:22:30.119
You're practically a man now.

1:22:36.168 --> 1:22:40.042
- Can we just talk alone, mom?

1:22:41.304 --> 1:22:42.827
- Maybe next time Finch.

1:22:44.046 --> 1:22:45.482
Besides, when this is all over,

1:22:45.569 --> 1:22:47.527
we'll have plenty of
time to talk alone.

1:22:49.007 --> 1:22:52.228
So tell me, do you like school?

1:22:52.315 --> 1:22:53.969
What subject is your favorite?

1:22:54.056 --> 1:22:57.407
- I like English,
literature especially.

1:22:57.494 --> 1:22:59.757
- I never cared much
for reading books.

1:22:59.844 --> 1:23:02.064
I'm really more of a
magazine girl myself.

1:23:02.151 --> 1:23:04.022
I just love looking
at the pictures

1:23:04.109 --> 1:23:05.632
and hearing about all
the Hollywood stars

1:23:05.719 --> 1:23:07.243
and their glamorous lives.

1:23:07.330 --> 1:23:08.766
With your good looks,

1:23:08.853 --> 1:23:10.811
you could be an actor
in Hollywood movies.

1:23:10.898 --> 1:23:12.639
And then you could
be one of those stars

1:23:12.726 --> 1:23:15.991
that takes his mom as a date
to the Academy Awards show.

1:23:16.078 --> 1:23:17.905
- I just saw my first
movie the other day.

1:23:17.993 --> 1:23:19.516
- Your first movie?

1:23:19.603 --> 1:23:21.170
Who's ever heard
of a 16 year old,

1:23:21.257 --> 1:23:23.128
who hasn't been to a movie?

1:23:23.215 --> 1:23:25.522
- They didn't have
movies up on Briar Rock.

1:23:27.915 --> 1:23:31.049
- Finch, I never meant
to leave you for so long.

1:23:31.136 --> 1:23:34.139
I just, well, I had to
take care of some things

1:23:34.226 --> 1:23:36.185
before I could come
back and get you.

1:23:36.272 --> 1:23:37.229
- What kind of things?

1:23:38.274 --> 1:23:39.884
- Important grownup things.

1:23:41.538 --> 1:23:44.106
- Well you just said that
I was practically grown.

1:23:44.193 --> 1:23:45.498
I'd like to know

1:23:45.585 --> 1:23:47.326
what kind of things you
had to take care of.

1:23:47.413 --> 1:23:49.154
- Finch, I saw to it

1:23:49.241 --> 1:23:51.374
that you had kind
folks to look after you

1:23:51.461 --> 1:23:53.985
and that is so much
more than I ever had.

1:23:54.072 --> 1:23:57.075
I have been fending for
myself for a long time,

1:23:57.162 --> 1:23:58.598
but not anymore.

1:23:58.685 --> 1:24:00.383
Now I have Mr. Billings
taking care of my business

1:24:00.470 --> 1:24:01.862
and you to look after me

1:24:01.949 --> 1:24:04.039
and I won't ever have
to be alone again

1:24:04.126 --> 1:24:06.998
because you'll be
there right by my side.

1:24:07.085 --> 1:24:08.695
Isn't that right, sugar,

1:24:08.782 --> 1:24:10.480
just you and me
taking on the world?

1:24:11.437 --> 1:24:12.525
- Yes, ma'am.

1:24:12.612 --> 1:24:14.136
- Well aren't you good mannered?

1:24:14.223 --> 1:24:15.528
Someone raised you right.

1:24:15.615 --> 1:24:17.095
- The Whittaker's raised me.

1:24:17.182 --> 1:24:17.965
- The Whittaker's?

1:24:19.358 --> 1:24:22.231
- Jeremiah and
Lila Mae Whittaker.

1:24:22.318 --> 1:24:25.060
That's who was taking care
of you when you left me.

1:24:25.147 --> 1:24:27.627
- Finch, let's not
dwell on the past.

1:24:27.714 --> 1:24:29.151
It's all so sad.

1:24:29.238 --> 1:24:31.109
Let's just keep our
eyes on the future.

1:24:31.196 --> 1:24:32.763
Tomorrow, you'll
come live with me.

1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:37.376
Now, my house is just a little
bump in the road right now

1:24:37.463 --> 1:24:39.117
but as soon as we sign
a few pieces of paper,

1:24:39.204 --> 1:24:40.510
we'll have plenty of money

1:24:40.597 --> 1:24:43.078
to buy a nice big studio
apartment downtown,

1:24:43.165 --> 1:24:45.167
right where all the action is.

1:24:45.254 --> 1:24:50.215
- I was hoping we could go to
the mountain, up to the cabin.

1:24:50.302 --> 1:24:52.130
I can show you
where I grew up and-

1:24:52.217 --> 1:24:56.395
- Oh honey, that old rickety
dump won't be there anymore.

1:24:56.482 --> 1:24:58.136
- What?

1:24:58.223 --> 1:25:00.443
- I mean we won't
be there anymore

1:25:00.530 --> 1:25:03.837
because we'll be out
doing exciting new things.

1:25:03.924 --> 1:25:07.145
It's time for you and me to
get out and see the world.

1:25:07.232 --> 1:25:09.974
Oh... it's hot out here.

1:25:11.497 --> 1:25:13.673
I have to get into
some air conditioning

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.371
before my makeup
melts off my face.

1:25:15.458 --> 1:25:16.720
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:25:16.807 --> 1:25:17.634
Mr. Billings?

1:25:18.983 --> 1:25:20.419
- I'm not sure I want to go.

1:25:20.506 --> 1:25:22.204
- What?

1:25:22.291 --> 1:25:24.249
- I might rather stay with
the Brennan's for awhile

1:25:24.336 --> 1:25:25.990
just until the hearing.

1:25:26.077 --> 1:25:28.862
- Well, I'm sorry, dear,
but that's not the plan.

1:25:28.949 --> 1:25:30.995
The judge says you'll stay
with me until the hearing.

1:25:31.082 --> 1:25:33.519
- I don't think I want to.

1:25:33.606 --> 1:25:35.652
- Well, I'm not asking
you what you want.

1:25:35.739 --> 1:25:39.003
I'm telling you as your mother
I know what's best for you.

1:25:39.090 --> 1:25:40.961
You believe in the
good book, don't you?

1:25:41.048 --> 1:25:42.659
- Yes, ma'am.

1:25:42.746 --> 1:25:46.010
- Well, it says honor thy
father and thy mother.

1:25:47.272 --> 1:25:48.404
Well, I'm your mother,

1:25:48.491 --> 1:25:50.014
so you have to do what I say.

1:25:52.756 --> 1:25:54.061
- Yes, ma'am.

1:25:54.149 --> 1:25:55.280
- That's better.

1:25:56.629 --> 1:25:58.153
See you tomorrow.

30 minutes, Miss Hague.

1:26:01.721 --> 1:26:02.809
It's just too hot out.

1:26:02.896 --> 1:26:04.159
Bye sweetie see you soon.

1:26:24.527 --> 1:26:27.356
- So what do you think?

1:26:30.315 --> 1:26:31.577
- I don't know.

1:26:38.149 --> 1:26:40.456
- Do you want to see her again?

1:26:44.155 --> 1:26:45.852
- I'm going to live with her.

1:26:56.123 --> 1:26:57.168
- Okay.

1:27:01.477 --> 1:27:03.522
- Are you sure
that's what you want?

1:27:05.089 --> 1:27:08.875
You could take some more
time to think about it.

1:27:12.879 --> 1:27:15.099
- Thinking about it
won't change anything.

1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:21.018

1:27:25.022 --> 1:27:25.588

I'll call the judge

1:27:28.721 --> 1:27:31.681

what you want to do.

1:42:00.114 --> 1:42:01.637
- I object, your honor.

1:42:01.724 --> 1:42:02.942
They're just saying
everything to you

1:42:03.029 --> 1:42:04.640
that they want to say to him.

1:42:04.727 --> 1:42:05.771
Now I move for a mistrial.

1:42:05.858 --> 1:42:07.817
- For the last time, Billings,

1:42:07.904 --> 1:42:10.602
this is not a trial,
it's a custody hearing.

1:42:10.689 --> 1:42:13.170
You can't declare a
mistrial of a hearing.

1:42:16.130 --> 1:42:20.177
Young man, did you happen
to hear everything they said

1:42:20.264 --> 1:42:21.874
or do I have to repeat it?

1:42:21.961 --> 1:42:23.267
- I heard it, your honor.

1:42:23.354 --> 1:42:25.008
- Good.

1:42:25.095 --> 1:42:26.879
Now listen to me, all of you,

1:42:28.098 --> 1:42:29.317
I appreciate you
coming down here

1:42:29.404 --> 1:42:30.666
and I'm certain that Finch here

1:42:30.753 --> 1:42:33.538
has benefited from
everything you've said,

1:42:33.625 --> 1:42:36.628
but unfortunately
the law is the law.

1:42:36.715 --> 1:42:39.022
Miss Hague is seeking
full custody of her son

1:42:39.109 --> 1:42:41.285
and since she is his
biological mother,

1:42:41.372 --> 1:42:43.200
the law protects her rights.

1:42:45.115 --> 1:42:47.900
And I am certain that you
are a very fine young man

1:42:47.987 --> 1:42:51.252
to have won the hearts of
all of these good people

1:42:51.339 --> 1:42:52.992
and I wish it were in my power

1:42:53.079 --> 1:42:54.516
to let you choose where
you'd like to live

1:42:54.603 --> 1:42:56.387
but according to the
laws of this state,

1:42:57.432 --> 1:42:58.607
that is not a factor either.

1:43:00.304 --> 1:43:02.654
I have no choice but to grant
Miss Hague full custody.

1:43:02.741 --> 1:43:05.222
- Well said, your honor.

1:43:05.309 --> 1:43:09.357
- Mr. Billings, I don't
like what I smell here.

1:43:09.444 --> 1:43:10.836
The law's on your
side this time,

1:43:10.923 --> 1:43:13.187
but you don't want to
cross my path again.

1:43:14.536 --> 1:43:17.103
[ominous music]

1:43:21.238 --> 1:43:23.414

give you back your bird.

1:43:25.677 --> 1:43:27.636
- Thanks for this.

1:43:27.723 --> 1:43:31.161
- You were right about me
leaving my family behind.

1:43:31.248 --> 1:43:34.208
I was just being stupid
and I won't do it again.

1:43:35.209 --> 1:43:38.603
- Good, they need you.

1:43:40.518 --> 1:43:42.825
- Problem is we need you too.

1:43:45.175 --> 1:43:47.743
Dad's right, you
should keep on writing.

1:43:47.830 --> 1:43:49.266
He should know, he's
one of the best.

1:43:50.876 --> 1:43:53.183
I think you'll be a
great writer one day.

1:43:53.270 --> 1:43:54.140
- You think so?

1:43:54.228 --> 1:43:55.403
- I know so.

1:43:55.490 --> 1:43:57.361
- Your honor, I object.

1:43:57.448 --> 1:43:58.884
- What are you doing?

1:43:58.971 --> 1:44:01.060
- Miss Hague, I'm afraid
you don't understand.

1:44:01.147 --> 1:44:02.975
- I do understand.

1:44:03.062 --> 1:44:05.717
I understand that this
family loves my son

1:44:05.804 --> 1:44:07.415
and he loves them.

1:44:07.502 --> 1:44:09.852
- Your honor, my client has
not consulted with her counsel.

1:44:09.939 --> 1:44:12.333
- That's because I'm firing
my counsel, your honor.

1:44:13.986 --> 1:44:16.641
- I need a moment
alone with my client.

1:44:16.728 --> 1:44:19.209
She doesn't understand
how these things work.

1:44:19.296 --> 1:44:21.516
- I believe she
does, Mr. Billings.

1:44:21.603 --> 1:44:23.779
- Don't get me
wrong, I love Finch

1:44:23.866 --> 1:44:26.216
I really do, but I'm
not fit to care for him.

1:44:26.303 --> 1:44:27.913
You see, I got problems

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.133
that have chased me around
my whole life, your honor

1:44:30.220 --> 1:44:32.222
and I can't shake
'em, yet anyway,

1:44:32.309 --> 1:44:34.572
but it's not the kind of
life I want for my son.

1:44:36.008 --> 1:44:38.272
My son is gonna
be a great writer,

1:44:39.969 --> 1:44:42.580
but if he stays with me,
he might not get there.

1:44:44.452 --> 1:44:45.061
- I see.

1:44:46.454 --> 1:44:48.456
Well based on this
new information,

1:44:48.543 --> 1:44:49.805
Mr and Mrs. Brennan,

1:44:49.892 --> 1:44:51.154
are you willing
to resume the role

1:44:51.241 --> 1:44:52.764
of foster parenting for Finch?

1:44:52.851 --> 1:44:54.244
- We are, your honor.
- Yes.

1:44:54.331 --> 1:44:56.028
- No your honor,
that's not good enough.

1:44:56.115 --> 1:44:58.988
Finch needs a stable
home that he can rely on.

1:44:59.075 --> 1:45:00.511
And for once in my life,

1:45:00.598 --> 1:45:02.339
I'm gonna be the one
who gives it to him.

1:45:02.426 --> 1:45:04.385
I wish to sign away
my parental rights

1:45:04.472 --> 1:45:07.301
so that Finch can
be properly adopted.

1:45:07.388 --> 1:45:09.390
- All right then.

1:45:09.477 --> 1:45:11.087
Mr and Mrs. Brennan,

1:45:11.174 --> 1:45:13.698
are you willing to become
adoptive parents to Finch?

1:45:15.265 --> 1:45:18.050
- Finch, what do you say?

1:45:19.095 --> 1:45:21.184
- What about Bobby?

1:45:21.271 --> 1:45:23.578
- Don't you worry
about anything.

1:45:23.665 --> 1:45:24.318
I'll handle him.

1:45:25.710 --> 1:45:28.887
Do this for me,
it's what I want.

1:45:33.501 --> 1:45:34.284
- Yes.

1:45:35.807 --> 1:45:37.243
- We all agree, your honor.

1:45:37.331 --> 1:45:39.071
- Then it's settled.

1:45:39.158 --> 1:45:40.682
The Brennan's will
retain full custody

1:45:40.769 --> 1:45:42.466

- Say you'll help him become
everything he's meant to be.

better and help us do it.
