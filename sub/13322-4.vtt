WEBVTT

00:01.486 --> 00:03.119
- Who was that guy? - That was Liam.

00:03.153 --> 00:04.627
The foster brother you told me about?

00:04.645 --> 00:05.842
You know what you did to me.

00:05.882 --> 00:08.376
Go get the rest of your
stuff and get home, please.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.877
No, Mom. I'm gonna live here with Cortney.

00:10.923 --> 00:11.912
I want to see Mason.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.259
If you wanted to see him, you shouldn't
have bailed on taking him tonight.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.516
It's come to our attention

00:15.522 --> 00:18.017
that you allowed a registered sex offender

00:18.064 --> 00:20.033
- to build sets for a school play?

00:20.094 --> 00:21.741
- I'm Aaron.
- Cameron.

00:21.788 --> 00:22.830
So why law school?

00:22.870 --> 00:25.231
I've been interning at the
Juvenile Justice Project.

00:25.244 --> 00:26.790
Well, I burned down the warehouse,

00:26.797 --> 00:28.693
so they gonna send me to jail anyway.

00:28.733 --> 00:30.798
Nick, don't. I love you.

00:30.851 --> 00:33.298
But we can't be together if you hurt yourself.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.133
It's okay, Nick. It's all over.

00:36.101 --> 00:38.810
Can we not talk about it anymore?

00:38.824 --> 00:41.102
I just want to be done with it, you know?

00:41.136 --> 00:42.575
Mariana...

00:43.065 --> 00:45.264
it's me, Nick.

00:48.510 --> 00:50.110
Texting your lover?

00:51.354 --> 00:53.835
Yeah, I'm letting her know I
can't hook up tomorrow night

00:53.842 --> 00:55.906
since it's my first wedding anniversary.

00:56.414 --> 00:57.379
Mm.

00:59.186 --> 01:00.631
Does this mean that
we're not gonna celebrate

01:00.651 --> 01:02.419
our first kiss anniversary anymore?

01:02.539 --> 01:05.422
We absolutely are. I want
credit for those 10 years.

01:05.642 --> 01:07.347
We can celebrate both.

01:07.858 --> 01:10.380
Plus Valentine's Day. That's
a lot of expensive meals.

01:10.418 --> 01:13.456
- Can we afford this? -You deserve it.

01:15.823 --> 01:17.429
You never treat yourselves.

01:17.718 --> 01:21.243
- You should go to Island Prime.
- Sorry we woke you, honey.

01:21.363 --> 01:22.373
It's okay.

01:22.615 --> 01:25.102
To wash my hair before school anyways.

01:32.813 --> 01:36.000
Maybe we should take out a
restraining order against Nick?

01:36.320 --> 01:39.187
Oh, because that was so
successful with Brandon?

01:39.537 --> 01:42.017
No, it's fine. Nick is in a

01:42.206 --> 01:44.411
secure treatment center.

01:44.531 --> 01:46.744
And they've taken away
his phone privileges.

01:46.744 --> 01:48.230
- Fine.
- A restraining order is not gonna make

01:48.243 --> 01:49.877
Mariana any safer.

01:49.997 --> 01:52.270
Might have the opposite effect on Nick.

01:52.284 --> 01:54.563
What are we gonna do? She's
been in here every night.

01:54.590 --> 01:56.593
Well, just keep up with her counseling

01:56.647 --> 01:58.086
and be patient.

01:59.054 --> 02:02.903
- Brandon, on the other hand...
- Give him time.

02:04.047 --> 02:05.869
It's been long enough, if you ask me.

02:05.989 --> 02:07.832
He's in a honeymoon period.

02:07.859 --> 02:09.418
Once that wears off and

02:09.459 --> 02:12.215
responsibilities of being
on his own start piling up,

02:12.242 --> 02:14.984
he'll come running back with
his tail between his legs.

02:15.104 --> 02:16.679
Which is a lot better than with

02:16.679 --> 02:18.480
his middle finger in the air.

02:20.867 --> 02:22.131
Yep.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.385
Ow. Ow.

02:25.822 --> 02:27.136
You okay?

02:27.502 --> 02:29.156
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:29.276 --> 02:31.328
When Mason gets used to the new place,

02:31.362 --> 02:34.158
I'll work on getting him
to stay in his own bed.

02:34.179 --> 02:36.034
Oh, yeah, no, it's...

02:36.881 --> 02:38.360
it's no problem.

02:38.394 --> 02:40.202
I'll make it up to you this weekend.

02:41.426 --> 02:43.342
Are you worried Eddie might bail?

02:43.369 --> 02:46.643
I hope not, for Mason's sake.

02:46.953 --> 02:48.714
I am a little nervous though.

02:48.754 --> 02:51.201
I've never even spent
a night away from him.

02:51.591 --> 02:53.295
Well, you deserve a break.

02:56.338 --> 02:58.805
I was thinking maybe
we should have a party.

02:59.894 --> 03:01.574
I think a party would be fun.

03:01.601 --> 03:03.072
I think we should do it.

03:06.509 --> 03:09.078
- Oh!

03:15.269 --> 03:17.640
Excuse me, are you new here?

03:17.700 --> 03:20.289
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. This is my first day.

03:20.638 --> 03:22.943
Maybe you could show
me around a little bit?

03:23.427 --> 03:26.277
Yeah, no, sorry. I'm not very rah-rah.

03:26.397 --> 03:28.282
But if you're free after school,

03:28.289 --> 03:30.172
I have this senior project
I've been working on.

03:30.186 --> 03:31.840
Maybe you could keep me company?

03:31.867 --> 03:34.879
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I think I could do that.

03:35.275 --> 03:37.139
I'm Callie, by the way.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.710
AJ.

03:43.202 --> 03:45.003
Welcome to Anchor Beach.

03:46.180 --> 03:49.219
Some of the parents pulled their
kids out after the lockdown, so

03:49.225 --> 03:50.926
they had a spot for AJ.

03:51.046 --> 03:52.109
So how does he feel about

03:52.123 --> 03:53.971
being transferred in the
middle of his senior year?

03:54.032 --> 03:56.244
He's happy to be going to a better school.

03:56.439 --> 03:58.348
Especially one that Callie goes to.

03:58.468 --> 04:00.372
So that's still on?

04:00.701 --> 04:01.918
Seems to be.

04:01.965 --> 04:03.806
Who can tell with those two?

04:04.646 --> 04:06.845
And what about us two?

04:06.965 --> 04:08.331
Are we on?

04:08.451 --> 04:10.543
Well, I'm just giving you some space.

04:11.188 --> 04:13.242
Giving space or taking it?

04:14.321 --> 04:16.241
Are you still mad that I went after Gabe

04:16.243 --> 04:17.487
at Brandon's party?

04:17.607 --> 04:19.779
I'm not mad, I'm...

04:20.216 --> 04:21.620
I'm just worried.

04:21.741 --> 04:23.342
I think he's a trigger.

04:24.370 --> 04:26.958
The minute he came back
into your life, you slipped.

04:31.119 --> 04:32.382
Okay.

04:34.206 --> 04:35.172
"Okay"?

04:35.207 --> 04:36.887
I won't see him again.

04:40.212 --> 04:42.612
I don't want any space between us.

04:42.922 --> 04:44.394
I want you.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.133
I want you, too.

04:49.253 --> 04:50.901
How about right now?

04:58.264 --> 05:00.330
So what are you gonna do with all these pictures?

05:00.366 --> 05:02.163
I don't know exactly.

05:02.882 --> 05:04.718
It's a photo essay.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.656
So maybe, like, on a big canvas,

05:08.059 --> 05:10.173
a mixed media collage.

05:11.025 --> 05:13.377
Is there, like, a
reason you're doing this?

05:13.573 --> 05:15.527
So I'll graduate.

05:16.013 --> 05:18.248
I mean when you're done
and people look at it.

05:18.283 --> 05:20.150
Why should they care?

05:20.185 --> 05:22.552
- Gee, thanks a lot.
- Well?

05:22.588 --> 05:24.721
Is there something you're trying to say?

05:25.048 --> 05:28.460
I'm saying that I was in
seven homes in seven years.

05:29.695 --> 05:33.646
Probably, like, write about
how I felt in each house.

05:34.066 --> 05:37.099
And I guess the reason is...

05:37.545 --> 05:41.520
to try to figure out why it's hard for me

05:41.570 --> 05:44.125
to trust anything is permanent.

05:45.167 --> 05:48.245
So what will you write about this house?

05:48.822 --> 05:50.427
That I felt safe.

05:50.973 --> 05:54.242
I mean, until social
workers showed up one day

05:54.253 --> 05:55.352
and took us away.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.973
- They say why?
- Do they ever?

05:59.359 --> 06:02.107
It was confusing though
'cause they were really nice

06:02.124 --> 06:04.771
and we thought they wanted to adopt us.

06:05.443 --> 06:07.464
But I guess not.

06:08.957 --> 06:12.125
- I do wonder what happened.
- Why don't you go ask?

06:13.405 --> 06:15.405
Just knock on the door.
Maybe they still live there.

06:15.407 --> 06:17.541
- I'm not doing that.
- Why not?

06:18.134 --> 06:20.714
Because that's not the
point of the project.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.554
I'm not interviewing
my old foster parents.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.416
It's not about them. It's about me.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.419
Okay.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.258
I'm getting fired.

06:35.461 --> 06:38.173
- Love, they can't do that.
- Yes, they can.

06:38.442 --> 06:40.492
A registered sex
offender helped build sets

06:40.492 --> 06:41.962
for a school play and I knew it.

06:41.965 --> 06:43.612
Okay, there's gotta
be something we can do.

06:43.618 --> 06:44.802
Something I can do.

06:44.802 --> 06:47.188
I was the one that suggested
it in the first place.

06:47.215 --> 06:48.627
Do we have $20,000?

06:48.660 --> 06:50.089
What?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.977
Monte knows this attorney who specializes

06:52.984 --> 06:54.479
in helping people get off the list,

06:54.480 --> 06:56.183
and that's the discount rate.

06:56.196 --> 06:57.917
Okay, how does this help you?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.995
Well, if he can get
Gabe's record expunged,

07:00.015 --> 07:01.649
it's like he was never on the list

07:01.662 --> 07:03.215
and then we did nothing wrong.

07:05.324 --> 07:08.721
All right, well, I hate
to tell you this, honey,

07:08.734 --> 07:10.966
but we don't have $20,000.

07:11.086 --> 07:12.801
We do on a line of credit on the house...

07:12.834 --> 07:16.133
- Uh, that is for emergencies.
- Well, I think this is an emergency, honey.

07:16.139 --> 07:19.561
- If lose my job, I lose my income...
- Okay, okay.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.942
What if we do pay the lawyer?

07:23.175 --> 07:24.156
You know, the fact of the matter is

07:24.156 --> 07:25.302
that Gabe doesn't want us helping him.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.862
He made that perfectly clear.

07:28.636 --> 07:30.788
How many of these places
are we going to today?

07:31.250 --> 07:33.111
This is only the second one.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:51.470 --> 07:52.843
Whoa, hey now.

07:52.919 --> 07:54.682
You didn't say anything
about breaking and entering.

07:54.802 --> 07:57.190
I'm not breaking and
entering. I'm trespassing.

08:11.623 --> 08:13.560
So what's the story of this house?

08:14.839 --> 08:16.302
Not a happy one.

08:17.229 --> 08:19.129
I was raped by my foster brother.

08:27.606 --> 08:28.850
Callie!

08:33.933 --> 08:35.337
What are you doing here?

08:35.928 --> 08:38.568
I'm taking some photos

08:38.945 --> 08:40.317
of the houses I've been in.

08:41.385 --> 08:42.635
But we'll leave now.

08:43.405 --> 08:44.625
Don't go.

08:44.953 --> 08:46.256
I'd like to talk to you.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.358
Please.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.004
Come inside?

08:51.296 --> 08:53.396
(theme music playing)

08:55.267 --> 08:58.399
It's not where you come from

08:58.437 --> 09:01.404
It's where you belong

09:01.440 --> 09:04.341
Nothing I would trade

09:04.376 --> 09:08.178
I wouldn't have it any other way

09:08.213 --> 09:11.281
You're surrounded by love

09:11.316 --> 09:13.249
And you're wanted

09:13.285 --> 09:16.419
So never feel alone

09:16.455 --> 09:19.289
You are home with me

09:19.324 --> 09:21.324
Right where you belong

09:31.868 --> 09:33.626
I'm glad to see you, Callie.

09:34.062 --> 09:36.248
I've had a lot of time to think lately

09:36.842 --> 09:39.886
with Liam in prison and my husband...

09:40.451 --> 09:41.699
We're divorcing.

09:42.506 --> 09:43.652
Anyway.

09:44.523 --> 09:47.192
I'm at an age when you tend to...

09:47.718 --> 09:50.504
reflect back on the
mistakes you've made in life.

09:51.053 --> 09:54.521
The mistakes that have haunted me the most

09:55.424 --> 09:57.915
are the ones I made with you, Callie.

09:59.356 --> 10:01.442
You have no idea

10:01.916 --> 10:03.820
how sorry I am.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.309
Sorry we ever

10:07.734 --> 10:10.132
brought you into this house...

10:11.063 --> 10:13.968
and allowed you to destroy our lives.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.243
My son

10:20.474 --> 10:24.067
is not a rapist or a thief.

10:24.685 --> 10:26.960
But his life is in ruins.

10:27.739 --> 10:29.252
And so is mine.

10:31.768 --> 10:32.816
So,

10:33.397 --> 10:35.177
take your pictures

10:35.871 --> 10:38.495
of a house that's no longer a home

10:39.549 --> 10:41.222
because of you.

10:44.998 --> 10:47.569
Sorry you brought me into this house, too.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.752
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Getting my pictures.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.188
It hasn't changed.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.415
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

12:00.456 --> 12:02.846
- Uh, playing piano.
- In the bathroom?

12:03.525 --> 12:05.793
Uh, well, you know, I...

12:05.967 --> 12:07.046
I was...

12:07.069 --> 12:09.158
So you're having a party
and you didn't invite me?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.187
- What's up with that?
- Who told you I was having a party?

12:11.307 --> 12:13.055
Mat, who heard from Jasper.

12:13.091 --> 12:14.973
Seriously? You're not
inviting your sister?

12:15.007 --> 12:17.008
Guess now that you moved out,
you don't care about us anymore.

12:17.038 --> 12:18.824
That's not true, okay? And
it's not really a party.

12:18.859 --> 12:20.802
- All right?
- What's not a party?

12:23.986 --> 12:26.632
Oh, hey. You're home early.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.371
Yeah.

12:30.013 --> 12:31.834
Well, what you up to?

12:31.954 --> 12:33.627
Oh, I just came to practice.

12:33.644 --> 12:35.036
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:35.346 --> 12:38.122
Good. Well, that's good.

12:39.317 --> 12:42.426
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, uh... not much.

12:42.449 --> 12:45.256
Just, uh, I was running low
on a few things, so, you know.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.666
Oh, were you?

12:46.666 --> 12:47.745
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:47.865 --> 12:51.410
- Like what? -  Like, you know, soap

12:51.422 --> 12:54.455
and a tube of toothpaste and toilet paper.

12:54.496 --> 12:56.724
Oh, I see. That's a bummer, huh?

12:57.745 --> 13:00.291
Well, you know, this is
a house, B. Not a Target.

13:00.332 --> 13:03.041
So, unless you're gonna
pay for those, I'm gonna...

13:04.409 --> 13:05.541
Yeah.

13:13.929 --> 13:15.147
She's here.

13:16.221 --> 13:17.220
Okay.

13:20.757 --> 13:22.191
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13:22.227 --> 13:24.042
- Oh, I just got here. - Can I get you some tea?

13:24.063 --> 13:25.542
Nope. I'm... I'm good.

13:25.662 --> 13:27.163
We appreciate you being here.

13:27.198 --> 13:31.267
- Is everything okay?
- Not exactly. Um...

13:31.652 --> 13:34.280
we wanted to talk to you about Gabe.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.347
So this is Liam's house?

13:42.356 --> 13:44.178
Yeah.

13:44.516 --> 13:47.316
It's amazing what horrors can
lie behind a white picket fence.

13:47.352 --> 13:49.063
Yeah, right?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.289
Wait, what's that?

13:54.425 --> 13:57.503
- That was my bedroom.
- You went inside?

13:58.591 --> 14:01.297
Yeah, his mom drove up

14:01.520 --> 14:04.747
when we were outside and invited me in.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.202
Why?

14:06.480 --> 14:09.138
To tell me how I ruined their lives

14:09.173 --> 14:11.345
like she was the victim.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.078
Do you think it's safe
to go inside these homes?

14:17.595 --> 14:20.395
I don't know, but I think I have to.

14:21.707 --> 14:25.203
I don't think it's enough
to just stand outside.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.196
I think I need to go in,

14:27.537 --> 14:30.489
face the people that made
me feel powerless, you know?

14:34.232 --> 14:35.739
So we still haven't talked about

14:35.760 --> 14:37.196
what happened with Brandon this afternoon.

14:39.237 --> 14:41.540
Hey, you're the one that
said we need to let him feel

14:41.569 --> 14:43.139
the responsibility of being on his own.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.074
Like depriving him of toothpaste?

14:45.109 --> 14:46.806
If that's what it takes.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.548
Come in!

14:54.185 --> 14:55.954
Hey, love. What's up?

14:56.842 --> 14:59.261
Don't worry, I'm not
coming to sleep with you.

14:59.267 --> 15:00.567
Honey, you know you can stay in here

15:00.596 --> 15:02.139
as long as you need to.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.395
I think I know what might help

15:06.675 --> 15:08.904
make me feel safe from Nick.

15:09.024 --> 15:10.266
Yeah? What's that?

15:12.098 --> 15:14.437
I think what I need to do is...

15:15.213 --> 15:16.872
I need to go see him.

15:21.594 --> 15:23.125
I mean, he was on time

15:23.149 --> 15:24.675
and he couldn't have been nicer.

15:24.704 --> 15:26.391
Really? 'Cause I was thinking maybe

15:26.414 --> 15:28.224
I shouldn't have told
him that I'm living here.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.173
He seems okay with it.

15:30.982 --> 15:33.136
You know, Eddie wasn't always a jerk.

15:33.490 --> 15:35.103
You know what? We should celebrate.

15:35.127 --> 15:37.424
- Maybe we should have a party.

15:37.544 --> 15:39.030
Great idea!

15:39.150 --> 15:40.923
- Hi, guys.

15:42.326 --> 15:44.569
- Mamma. - Brandon, Cortney.

15:44.598 --> 15:46.901
- Hello.
- Well, someone's thirsty.

15:47.551 --> 15:49.256
Oh. Uh, you know what?

15:49.267 --> 15:50.469
- Cort, maybe you should take
- Yeah.

15:50.503 --> 15:54.425
your beer... that I won't be
drinking 'cause I'm not 21.

15:55.410 --> 15:57.106
Nice to see you again.

15:57.835 --> 16:00.009
Just gonna take these inside.

16:01.704 --> 16:04.146
Well, it looks like
someone is having a party.

16:04.182 --> 16:06.658
Oh. Oh, you know what? No, it's not a party.

16:06.664 --> 16:09.703
We're just inviting a few friends, yeah.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.270
- It's more like a gathering actually.
- Ah, well...

16:12.390 --> 16:13.509
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:13.538 --> 16:15.082
Well, I was just out
doing a little shopping

16:15.092 --> 16:16.999
and I thought I would
pick you up a few things,

16:17.009 --> 16:18.615
but it looks like maybe
you don't need them.

16:18.661 --> 16:20.471
Uh, actually, you know what?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.299
I can totally take those right now. Great.

16:24.902 --> 16:26.836
Does Mom know?

16:26.871 --> 16:28.557
Does she need to?

16:31.443 --> 16:33.067
Do you, uh...

16:33.691 --> 16:35.902
maybe want to come inside,
check the place out?

16:36.022 --> 16:37.671
Uh, maybe another time.

16:38.349 --> 16:39.919
Hey.

16:40.558 --> 16:42.117
We miss you.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.054
I miss you, too.

16:48.498 --> 16:50.695
Be responsible, please.

16:50.745 --> 16:52.061
I will.

17:04.275 --> 17:05.645
Can I help you?

17:06.008 --> 17:07.980
Hi, Sheila.

17:09.045 --> 17:10.858
Do you remember me?

17:12.250 --> 17:13.584
Callie?

17:14.285 --> 17:16.252
- Oh, Callie!
- Hey.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.087
Come in!

17:19.398 --> 17:21.906
Your project sounds wonderful.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.748
I just hope you remember this home

17:24.750 --> 17:26.259
as a safe and loving one.

17:26.317 --> 17:28.630
I do, yeah.

17:28.818 --> 17:32.095
You and Tom were really nice to us.

17:32.668 --> 17:34.814
Tom passed away last year.

17:35.466 --> 17:37.759
- I'm really sorry.
- Thank you.

17:37.879 --> 17:40.925
It's been hard. Especially for Kyle,

17:41.045 --> 17:43.362
losing the only father he ever knew.

17:44.566 --> 17:47.249
- So you adopted Kyle?
- Yes.

17:50.752 --> 17:54.089
Can I ask why you didn't keep me and Jude?

17:56.327 --> 17:58.093
Didn't they tell you?

17:58.129 --> 17:59.228
No.

17:59.569 --> 18:01.563
They promised to tell you.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.967
We wanted to keep you,

18:05.002 --> 18:07.530
but because of our age
and Kyle's special needs,

18:07.544 --> 18:09.821
they wouldn't let us
adopt all three of you.

18:10.074 --> 18:11.655
Kyle had special needs?

18:11.713 --> 18:14.170
Yes. You remember, he had dyslexia

18:14.221 --> 18:16.447
and impulse control issues.

18:16.981 --> 18:20.499
No, I just remember him being really sweet

18:20.514 --> 18:23.089
and kind of like Jude.

18:24.097 --> 18:27.606
I felt terrible when they took you away.

18:27.642 --> 18:29.223
But you and Jude had each other

18:29.260 --> 18:30.934
and Kyle was all alone.

18:31.054 --> 18:32.486
And Callie...

18:33.264 --> 18:35.164
I am so sorry.

18:35.429 --> 18:38.540
No, it's okay. I understand.

18:39.439 --> 18:41.036
How is Kyle?

18:42.106 --> 18:44.507
Kyle is in prison.

18:44.862 --> 18:48.415
Well, in juvenile
detention until he turns 18.

18:48.451 --> 18:50.829
Then he'll go to an adult facility.

18:51.082 --> 18:52.345
For how long?

18:53.084 --> 18:54.917
The rest of his life.

18:56.354 --> 18:58.978
The legal term is "Nunc Pro Tunc,"

18:58.990 --> 19:00.501
meaning "Then For Now."

19:00.523 --> 19:02.773
Basically, it allows
us to go back in time,

19:02.777 --> 19:05.794
re-try the case with the
original ADA and judge.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.932
Why would I want to re-try my case?

19:07.961 --> 19:09.505
Because the laws have changed.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.681
And today, I believe you'd
be found factually innocent.

19:12.695 --> 19:14.812
Frankly, you never
should have been required

19:14.826 --> 19:17.212
to register as a sex
offender in the first place.

19:18.175 --> 19:20.555
How much is this gonna cost me?

19:20.598 --> 19:23.766
Lena and I would be willing
to cover your legal costs.

19:23.886 --> 19:26.457
No. No, I'm not comfortable with that.

19:26.486 --> 19:28.984
It could be a loan
that you would pay back.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.442
- How?
- I don't have any money.

19:31.562 --> 19:33.771
Well, we thought that if you were willing,

19:33.780 --> 19:36.221
you could do some work on the house maybe.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.265
What's... what's going on?

19:43.658 --> 19:45.630
Hey, love. Um...

19:45.839 --> 19:47.892
This is Steve Pargrave. He's a lawyer.

19:47.961 --> 19:49.719
He thinks that maybe he could help

19:49.736 --> 19:51.714
Gabe out with his situation.

19:51.737 --> 19:52.799
Oh.

19:53.298 --> 19:54.359
Really?

19:55.212 --> 19:56.383
Look

19:56.503 --> 19:58.176
I'm sorry you're in trouble because of

19:58.222 --> 20:00.049
me building those sets,

20:00.490 --> 20:02.613
and I don't want you to lose your job.

20:04.116 --> 20:05.688
But I've been offered a deal.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.864
If I plead guilty and agree to relocate,

20:11.415 --> 20:12.731
I won't do any time.

20:12.851 --> 20:14.460
Where... where would you go?

20:14.901 --> 20:17.933
I don't know. I have a
friend who works in Reno.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.177
Wherever you go,

20:19.675 --> 20:20.923
you'll have to register.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.337
I know.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.365
But I can't go back to prison.

20:25.597 --> 20:28.213
Look, I've already had a
preliminary conversation

20:28.245 --> 20:29.907
with the ADA, Ellen Wilkins,

20:29.918 --> 20:31.432
who indicated that she wouldn't object.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.492
And I know Ellen. She's
a straight-shooter.

20:33.544 --> 20:36.404
If you plead guilty to this parole violation,

20:36.427 --> 20:38.528
you'll destroy your chance of ever

20:38.557 --> 20:40.517
getting off the sex offender registry.

20:41.398 --> 20:43.620
Can you guarantee you
can get me off the list?

20:43.740 --> 20:45.685
No, I can't.

20:45.871 --> 20:48.238
But I believe the odds are
definitely in your favor.

20:49.066 --> 20:50.042
Well,

20:50.773 --> 20:52.345
I've never been a lucky person.

20:52.465 --> 20:56.476
And this plea deal is guaranteed.

20:56.974 --> 20:59.174
I'm really sorry I can't help you.

21:10.242 --> 21:11.552
So what happened?

21:11.672 --> 21:13.351
Her name was Martha Johnson.

21:13.385 --> 21:15.155
She lived a few blocks away.

21:15.155 --> 21:16.999
She was always very kind to Kyle.

21:17.119 --> 21:19.627
He used to do a lot of odd jobs for her,

21:19.747 --> 21:22.080
and then when they found her dead, well,

21:22.283 --> 21:24.365
they rushed to judgment.

21:25.844 --> 21:28.431
How long has Kyle been in juvie?

21:28.551 --> 21:31.530
Since the day he was
arrested. Almost four years.

21:31.857 --> 21:32.996
They wouldn't give him bail

21:33.019 --> 21:35.289
because he has distant relatives in Cuba

21:35.307 --> 21:37.590
and the prosecutor said
he was a flight risk.

21:37.628 --> 21:39.103
It was all so unfair.

21:39.223 --> 21:41.038
Police never looked at anybody else.

21:42.895 --> 21:45.442
They just saw this former foster kid,

21:45.470 --> 21:47.638
a minority with developmental issues,

21:47.661 --> 21:48.923
and they assumed he did it.

21:49.568 --> 21:51.387
We couldn't afford a lawyer,

21:51.624 --> 21:54.013
so all he had was a public defender

21:54.023 --> 21:56.561
who I don't think ever
believed he was innocent.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.016
We even had an alibi witness,

21:59.067 --> 22:00.765
but he never even talked to him.

22:01.572 --> 22:04.286
Kyle never had anyone on his side.

22:07.331 --> 22:09.187
He's only 17.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.938
And he's gonna spend the
rest of his life in prison

22:11.957 --> 22:14.305
for something I know in
my heart that he didn't do.

22:19.418 --> 22:21.084
Your mom said I can come up.

22:23.279 --> 22:24.890
Look, um...

22:28.505 --> 22:32.496
I told you, I'm... I'm not, uh, good at...

22:38.678 --> 22:40.246
I don't like...

22:40.696 --> 22:42.112
owing people.

22:42.474 --> 22:44.482
Or having people owe me anything.

22:44.724 --> 22:45.786
I just...

22:46.515 --> 22:49.680
keep my head down, and
that's how it is, you know?

22:54.813 --> 22:55.894
Don't you...

22:57.073 --> 22:58.948
don't you ever get lonely?

23:03.983 --> 23:06.021
Uh, I, um...

23:29.081 --> 23:30.989
At first he said no,

23:30.998 --> 23:32.701
but after he talked to Jesus,

23:32.725 --> 23:34.702
he changed his mind, and

23:34.747 --> 23:37.273
I guess the ADA, Ellen Wilkins,

23:37.310 --> 23:39.486
is supportive of Gabe
getting off the list.

23:39.685 --> 23:42.535
So anyway, we're gonna go
meet with the judge tomorrow.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.405
This is a good thing.

23:44.438 --> 23:46.201
Yeah, he doesn't have to move away, so...

23:46.647 --> 23:48.150
that's gotta be a relief.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.479
Why are you being like this?

23:50.493 --> 23:52.479
You stood here less than 24 hours ago

23:52.521 --> 23:53.837
and said you weren't gonna see him again.

23:53.839 --> 23:56.433
And then Stef and Lena asked for my help.

23:56.651 --> 23:58.336
And I feel guilty about Gabe

23:58.350 --> 23:59.936
being on the list all these years.

23:59.941 --> 24:01.825
I feel like this is part of my amends.

24:01.843 --> 24:03.398
Come on! Your amends?

24:04.076 --> 24:06.252
He's the guy that got you
into drugs in the first place.

24:06.261 --> 24:09.176
He didn't make me an addict. I did that.

24:09.603 --> 24:12.350
Mike, this is important to me.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.689
And why can't you have a
little bit of compassion

24:14.702 --> 24:16.313
about what Gabe went through?

24:16.619 --> 24:18.174
I have compassion

24:18.294 --> 24:20.858
for you and concern for your sobriety.

24:21.692 --> 24:23.306
Is that what you're concerned about?

24:24.327 --> 24:26.527
Or are you worried I still
have feelings for Gabe?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.146
I don't know.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.134
Do you?

24:35.758 --> 24:36.802
Hey!

24:37.176 --> 24:38.533
How's it going?

24:40.236 --> 24:42.203
- What's up, brother?
- Are we the first ones here?

24:42.213 --> 24:43.962
Oh, my friends don't show anywhere

24:43.967 --> 24:45.791
until after 10:00 earliest.

24:45.856 --> 24:47.949
Hm. Your friends don't have curfews.

24:48.069 --> 24:48.933
True.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.141
- Jasper's here.
- Oh, come in the kitchen!

24:51.183 --> 24:53.086
We've got beer and I'm
making skinny margaritas.

24:53.132 --> 24:54.887
- Mmm!
- Here you go.

24:55.086 --> 24:56.771
- What?
- Little housewarming gift.

24:56.794 --> 24:58.303
I heard you could use it.

25:00.711 --> 25:01.978
Ha-ha, very funny.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.254
Yeah, I thought so.

25:03.578 --> 25:06.093
Actually, where's your bathroom at?

25:06.213 --> 25:07.744
Are you serious? You just got here.

25:07.782 --> 25:09.002
You're gonna take a dump in the bathroom?

25:09.011 --> 25:11.981
Well, I've got no control
over when nature calls.

25:13.170 --> 25:14.395
Yeah. And light a match.

25:14.395 --> 25:15.861
And don't forget the courtesy flush.

25:16.028 --> 25:17.443
- Seriously.
- Mm-hmm.

25:30.555 --> 25:32.839
Ellen. Hey, it's Mike Foster.

25:33.479 --> 25:34.965
Good, good. How are you?

25:36.551 --> 25:39.099
Oh, yeah. No rest for the weary, huh?

25:40.743 --> 25:43.480
Listen, I wanted to talk to
you about the petition to get

25:43.536 --> 25:46.306
Gabe Duncroft off the
sex offender registry.

25:48.301 --> 25:50.631
Oh, thank god you're here.

25:51.192 --> 25:52.357
Where's everyone else?

25:52.375 --> 25:54.329
We're it. Boring.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.295
What are you drinking?

25:55.374 --> 25:57.791
Oh, it's Cortney's skinny margarita.

25:57.852 --> 25:59.402
Splash of tequila.

26:00.617 --> 26:02.149
Oh, my god, that's not a splash.

26:02.176 --> 26:03.690
You made it! Aah!

26:03.762 --> 26:05.030
Hey.  Hey, Cortney.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.666
Can I make you guys some margaritas?

26:06.669 --> 26:07.927
I'll just take a beer.

26:07.936 --> 26:09.630
Yeah, I'm good with water. Thank you.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.487
Oh, come on! No fun! It's a party!

26:12.489 --> 26:14.071
Uh, yeah, maybe later.

26:14.888 --> 26:16.660
Maryann, you want a refill?

26:17.194 --> 26:20.340
It's Mariana, but no, I'm good, thanks.

26:21.218 --> 26:22.730
Hello!

26:22.754 --> 26:23.947
Gabby!

26:23.983 --> 26:25.162
- Finally!

26:26.508 --> 26:27.650
Finally!

26:27.677 --> 26:30.081
Ooh, let's get this party started!

26:30.089 --> 26:31.626
Girl, you got some catching up to do!

26:31.659 --> 26:32.573
Come on!

26:37.993 --> 26:40.113
I never should have told you Brandon was having a party.

26:40.178 --> 26:42.155
Yeah, well, probably not.

26:43.222 --> 26:45.695
Are we seriously going to spy on our son?

26:45.732 --> 26:47.663
We're not spying. We're checking on him.

26:47.783 --> 26:49.765
We had a lovely dinner.

26:49.793 --> 26:50.920
- Yes.
- Can't we just go home

26:50.934 --> 26:52.879
and continue celebrating our anniversary

26:52.888 --> 26:54.814
before the kids get home, please?

26:55.454 --> 26:58.247
Speaking of kids, is that our car?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.241
It's a very common car.

27:04.243 --> 27:05.774
We can't be sure that that's our car.

27:05.784 --> 27:07.636
6-Q-A-C-6-4-2.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.459
You know our license plate?

27:10.099 --> 27:12.457
Really? That surprises you? I'm a cop.

27:12.765 --> 27:16.558
I cannot believe that our
kids are at Brandon's party.

27:16.598 --> 27:18.367
- What...
- Really? That surprises you?

27:18.373 --> 27:19.997
You're a parent of teenagers.

27:20.357 --> 27:22.213
And by the looks of it,
it's not much of a party.

27:22.242 --> 27:24.788
It's more of a gathering.

27:25.989 --> 27:27.567
How much paper did you use?

27:27.578 --> 27:28.657
Not much, okay?

27:28.686 --> 27:30.525
- We should just call a plumber.
- No, no, no.

27:30.554 --> 27:32.828
Plumbers cost money. Well,
if you can afford this place,

27:32.852 --> 27:34.487
I'm sure you can afford a plumber.

27:34.499 --> 27:36.216
- I mean, what's the rent anyway?
- A lot.

27:36.233 --> 27:38.264
Are you paying like half?

27:40.921 --> 27:43.810
I guess I will be, yeah.

27:46.424 --> 27:49.500
So, like, are you having sex all the time?

27:51.891 --> 27:53.370
So what do you guys do?

27:53.387 --> 27:54.901
We go to school.

27:54.942 --> 27:56.316
Oh. College?

27:56.363 --> 27:58.550
- High school.
- Oh. Right.

27:58.584 --> 28:01.293
Heh. Forgot you were cougaring out.

28:01.345 --> 28:02.628
Shut up.

28:03.167 --> 28:03.950
Refill?

28:03.968 --> 28:05.233
- Yeah, I'll come with you.
- Yeah?

28:05.256 --> 28:08.213
So what's the sex like? Does
he prematurely ejaculate?

28:08.277 --> 28:09.988
Gabby!

28:10.261 --> 28:12.210
Hey. Thanks for comin'.

28:15.011 --> 28:16.166
What?

28:16.948 --> 28:19.472
- Thank you for inviting us.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.473
I see you got drinks.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.909
Yeah, it's the first time
Cortney's had a night off

28:29.129 --> 28:30.666
from being a mom, so she's...

28:30.678 --> 28:32.853
Oh, yeah. How is it being a dad?

28:32.882 --> 28:35.468
Oh, I'm not a dad. Mason's not my kid.

28:37.905 --> 28:39.442
Thanks.

28:41.124 --> 28:42.946
Why are you not more
concerned about the fact

28:42.957 --> 28:45.120
that our kids are at a party
where there might be alcohol

28:45.155 --> 28:46.454
and who knows what else available?

28:46.507 --> 28:48.056
First of all, it's
probably not the first party

28:48.079 --> 28:49.099
they've been to where there's alcohol,

28:49.100 --> 28:50.695
and at least they're with Brandon

28:50.712 --> 28:53.097
and not some random house
party with no parent home.

28:53.103 --> 28:54.924
Oh, yeah, no, that's
right, there is a parent.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.856
A 21-year-old girl with a toddler.

28:57.644 --> 29:00.745
- I can't.
- What? What are you doing?

29:00.788 --> 29:02.539
Honey, if you barge in
there like momma cop,

29:02.545 --> 29:04.511
you are going to alienate
all of those kids.

29:04.517 --> 29:07.590
- What?
- No, I'm not going to barge.

29:07.772 --> 29:09.105
Now I'm spying.

29:19.715 --> 29:20.730
Hey.

29:22.006 --> 29:23.265
Hey.

29:24.379 --> 29:27.766
So it's really good to see you
and Mat back together again.

29:28.305 --> 29:29.756
And...

29:30.061 --> 29:32.996
I'm sorry I was hard on you about Nick.

29:33.031 --> 29:34.182
It wasn't cool.

29:36.101 --> 29:37.066
It's okay.

29:37.419 --> 29:38.678
Hey, hey!

29:38.695 --> 29:42.208
- Ready for another?
- Oh, no, I think I'm good, thanks.

29:42.328 --> 29:44.340
Wh... How many is that?

29:44.688 --> 29:46.581
Who wants to know?

29:47.603 --> 29:49.024
Okay then.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.914
I don't think he got a fair trial.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.854
Apparently Kyle had an alibi witness

29:53.885 --> 29:56.261
who can verify that he was with
him at the time of the murder.

29:56.319 --> 29:59.183
His lawyers, public defenders,
never looked into it.

29:59.197 --> 30:02.046
- Well, maybe he had a reason.
- Or maybe he just didn't care.

30:02.916 --> 30:05.752
- Sheila thinks he's innocent.
- Well, she's his mom.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.764
If you knew Kyle,

30:07.799 --> 30:12.168
he was so sweet and gentle.

30:14.072 --> 30:16.593
It's hard to imagine him killing anyone.

30:23.286 --> 30:24.981
He called you?

30:25.016 --> 30:27.151
But I thought he was
locked up in a hospital.

30:27.165 --> 30:29.036
Well, he is, but...

30:29.232 --> 30:30.994
I mean, I don't know how,

30:31.022 --> 30:32.625
but somehow, he got to use a phone.

30:32.625 --> 30:33.956
Why... why didn't you tell me?

30:33.992 --> 30:36.594
- Because I didn't want to freak you out.
- Well, I'm freaked out.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.119
Well...

30:38.490 --> 30:41.275
you're gonna be more
freaked out because...

30:42.801 --> 30:45.234
- I'm going to go see him tomorrow.
- What?

30:45.456 --> 30:46.523
Why?

30:46.570 --> 30:48.388
Because he still thinks
that I'm his girlfriend

30:48.397 --> 30:50.160
and that we're gonna be
together when he gets out.

30:50.175 --> 30:53.024
- Yeah, because he's crazy.
- No, because that's what I told him.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.673
To get him to put the gun down.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.413
I told him that I'm still his girlfriend

30:57.450 --> 31:00.597
and that... I loved him.

31:04.628 --> 31:06.695
Oh. Okay.

31:07.297 --> 31:09.558
Well, I understand why
you said those things,

31:09.566 --> 31:11.574
but why do you have to go see him?

31:11.596 --> 31:13.930
To tell him that I didn't mean any of it.

31:13.965 --> 31:16.083
Because as long as he
thinks that I love him

31:16.112 --> 31:19.433
and want to be with him,
he's gonna want to be with me

31:19.665 --> 31:21.838
and I'm not gonna feel safe.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.994
I don't know.

31:24.030 --> 31:26.742
- I just... I guess I just need to... -

31:27.219 --> 31:29.372
- Wait... Oh, my god!
- What?

31:29.408 --> 31:31.946
I... I think I just saw my mom.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.476
Guys, Mom's here.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.782
- Wait, someone's mom's here?
- Are you sure?

31:35.820 --> 31:38.073
Yeah, I just saw her
in the window, I think.

31:38.123 --> 31:40.123
- I'm out.

31:47.098 --> 31:48.064
Hey.

31:48.184 --> 31:49.906
Uh, hey.

31:50.168 --> 31:52.984
- Is Cortney here?
- Uh... yeah.

31:53.104 --> 31:54.438
Come on in.

31:56.141 --> 31:58.411
Can I, uh, get you a beer?

31:58.432 --> 32:00.600
- Oh, no thanks.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.944
Hey.

32:01.980 --> 32:03.015
Are you Cortney Strathmore?

32:03.047 --> 32:05.502
- Yes.
- Cool.

32:06.511 --> 32:08.135
You've been served.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.890
- Anyone home?
- Lena: We're in here!

32:21.107 --> 32:22.811
- Hey!

32:22.931 --> 32:24.805
- Hi!
- Hi, guys.

32:24.827 --> 32:26.422
How was your night?

32:26.542 --> 32:27.797
- Fine.
- Yeah, it was good.

32:27.803 --> 32:28.836
Good.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.257
- How was your night? - Oh, it was great.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.542
We actually took your suggestion.

32:31.545 --> 32:34.811
- We went to Island Prime.
- Mmm. Delicious. I'm stuffed.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.869
Oh, yeah? Well, and then what'd you do?

32:38.517 --> 32:40.170
Why would you ask us that?

32:40.421 --> 32:41.249
No reason.

32:41.272 --> 32:44.247
But, you know, we did
get you guys flowers.

32:44.265 --> 32:45.657
And a card!

32:45.669 --> 32:48.442
- No way! Oh, my goodness.
- Mm-hmm. Happy anniversary.

32:48.511 --> 32:50.396
Thank you so much.

32:50.971 --> 32:52.624
- Well, goodnight.
- Night.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.191
- Night!
- Good night, my babies.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.328
Idiot.

32:55.357 --> 32:57.091
I know what I saw.

33:06.441 --> 33:07.937
You really want that?

33:08.796 --> 33:10.553
Yeah, I really do.

33:11.052 --> 33:13.048
What is it, like your fourth?

33:14.515 --> 33:16.006
You're not my dad.

33:18.275 --> 33:21.244
You're also not Mason's.

33:22.271 --> 33:24.724
But, you know, I don't expect you to be.

33:26.783 --> 33:29.249
I'm also sorry he kicks
you in the head at night.

33:29.457 --> 33:31.285
Move back home if you want.

33:41.593 --> 33:43.565
I love Mason.

33:46.715 --> 33:47.963
And I love you.

33:52.050 --> 33:53.431
Why?

33:55.415 --> 33:56.760
I've got a kid.

33:57.021 --> 33:59.376
And a husband who's suing for full custody

33:59.393 --> 34:01.453
because I'm an unfit mother.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.481
Which I probably am right now.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.717
You're not an unfit mother.

34:09.422 --> 34:12.188
You're a wonderful mom.

34:14.324 --> 34:18.263
And a beautiful woman
and that's why I love you.

34:19.980 --> 34:21.853
You don't need all this.

34:23.007 --> 34:24.649
I want it.

34:27.329 --> 34:29.004
And we'll get through this.

34:29.714 --> 34:31.628
Okay? Trust me, no

34:31.871 --> 34:34.458
judge would give Eddie
full custody of a...

34:34.922 --> 34:36.402
a hamster,

34:37.014 --> 34:38.710
let alone a child.

34:39.713 --> 34:41.233
I promise.

34:56.681 --> 34:57.806
Well,

34:58.589 --> 35:00.967
sorry for a boring night.

35:02.203 --> 35:03.850
Company wasn't boring.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.503
Aww.

35:16.367 --> 35:17.661
Come here.

35:36.345 --> 35:37.592
So...

35:39.316 --> 35:42.132
I don't know if, uh...

35:42.252 --> 35:44.201
if I should be careful

35:44.616 --> 35:46.519
because of what happened to you,

35:46.803 --> 35:48.677
or if...

35:49.454 --> 35:53.822
- like, there's things that don't feel good or...
- Hey, thank you for asking.

35:55.764 --> 35:57.298
But you don't have to.

35:57.939 --> 36:01.906
I don't want you to treat
me like a victim or whatever.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.204
I don't.

36:04.450 --> 36:06.007
Okay.

36:07.210 --> 36:09.207
'Cause rape isn't sex.

36:09.562 --> 36:11.079
I know.

36:12.482 --> 36:15.260
I just wanted to know if
you need anything from me.

36:16.486 --> 36:18.603
If I do, I will tell you.

36:20.390 --> 36:21.750
Okay.

36:27.397 --> 36:28.805
So is that it?

36:30.530 --> 36:32.367
I just, uh...

36:33.470 --> 36:36.265
- I know you're Super Callie

36:36.273 --> 36:40.688
but this business with Kyle,
this is not your problem.

36:40.724 --> 36:42.109
I know.

36:43.697 --> 36:45.821
I just want you to take care of yourself.

36:46.097 --> 36:47.446
I will.

36:49.319 --> 36:50.687
I am.

36:58.195 --> 37:00.367
Okay, shouldn't they have called by now?

37:00.418 --> 37:02.890
Well, these things take time.

37:05.268 --> 37:09.090
Is the judge, like, is he
gonna make a decision today?

37:09.106 --> 37:11.106
- Honey, I don't know.

37:18.014 --> 37:20.115
Oh, hi. We were expecting
your call. Come in, come in.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.300
Um...

37:22.452 --> 37:26.319
we, uh, didn't want to give
you this news over the phone.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.025
I'm done.

37:31.389 --> 37:32.694
I'm off the list.

37:32.814 --> 37:34.880
- What?

37:41.991 --> 37:44.086
That is fantastic. That's such great news.

37:44.126 --> 37:46.241
Thank you. Thank you.

37:48.411 --> 37:50.278
The ADA told me you called her.

37:51.348 --> 37:54.215
Thank you for putting in a word for me.

37:54.251 --> 37:55.513
No problem.

38:02.798 --> 38:04.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:04.932 --> 38:07.525
I thought you would be be
back in New York by now.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.098
Yeah, um...

38:12.565 --> 38:14.169
I don't go to NYU.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.637
And my name is not Cameron. It's Callie.

38:18.757 --> 38:20.673
I'm a high school senior.

38:22.145 --> 38:23.254
I was...

38:23.446 --> 38:25.110
just having, like, a really bad day

38:25.148 --> 38:27.657
and I guess I just... I didn't want to...

38:28.118 --> 38:30.084
be me for a little while.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.120
You know?

38:32.809 --> 38:34.088
I'm sorry.

38:35.943 --> 38:37.125
It's okay.

38:37.409 --> 38:38.842
I understand that,

38:38.853 --> 38:41.115
wanting a vacation from yourself.

38:43.066 --> 38:44.254
Was the, uh,

38:44.810 --> 38:47.068
- boyfriend part...
- True.

38:47.103 --> 38:49.561
- Awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

38:51.041 --> 38:54.748
So is this why you wanted
to see me, to come clean?

38:54.794 --> 38:56.854
Yeah. Yeah.

38:56.859 --> 38:58.379
And also...

38:58.751 --> 39:01.460
you said you work at the
Juvenile Justice Center.

39:01.580 --> 39:02.580
I do, yeah.

39:02.626 --> 39:04.099
Okay, so I was wondering
if you know anything

39:04.105 --> 39:06.721
about a murder case involving Kyle Snow.

39:06.976 --> 39:09.224
He was 14 when he was accused of murder,

39:09.259 --> 39:11.704
and I'm not sure he got a fair trial.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.085
Be right back here if you need me, okay?

39:22.140 --> 39:23.171
Okay.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.690
Thank you, Mrs. Adams-Foster.

39:30.247 --> 39:31.279
Hi.

39:32.382 --> 39:33.660
Hey.

39:35.385 --> 39:38.016
We can't touch or hug. It's a...

39:38.231 --> 39:39.739
it's a rule.

39:40.263 --> 39:42.257
Oh. Okay.

39:46.329 --> 39:48.575
Thank you.

39:49.165 --> 39:50.976
For coming to see me.

39:54.271 --> 39:56.237
I...

39:56.551 --> 39:58.239
I needed to talk to you.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.241
Me too.

40:01.655 --> 40:04.045
Look, I'm so sorry I scared you.

40:05.181 --> 40:07.115
And for everything I did.

40:07.150 --> 40:10.429
I'm so, so sorry.

40:11.221 --> 40:14.055
And I am... I'm really
trying to get better.

40:16.159 --> 40:17.492
I'm glad.

40:18.556 --> 40:20.094
I want you to get better.

40:20.130 --> 40:21.826
You're the reason I'm still here.

40:22.232 --> 40:24.032
And alive.

40:25.535 --> 40:27.524
I really think I would have killed myself

40:27.546 --> 40:29.170
if... if you didn't tell me

40:29.205 --> 40:30.911
that you love me.

40:31.031 --> 40:32.919
That meant so much.

40:33.318 --> 40:37.437
The fact that someone
as beautiful as you are

40:37.557 --> 40:39.213
loves me.

40:42.535 --> 40:44.152
I love you, too.

40:45.914 --> 40:49.190
You're like my reason for living.

40:52.716 --> 40:56.064
I do love you

40:56.537 --> 40:59.103
and want you to get better, but...

41:00.851 --> 41:02.136
not for me...

41:03.570 --> 41:05.106
but for yourself.

41:06.397 --> 41:09.010
As long as I have you, I can do that.

41:11.214 --> 41:13.589
I do have you, right?

41:20.523 --> 41:22.282
Yes, you do.
