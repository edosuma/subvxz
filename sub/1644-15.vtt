34:41.038 --> 34:42.665
Or if she does.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.418
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us...

34:46.585 --> 34:48.795
...is to get whatever information
Sara has?

34:53.717 --> 34:56.053
What if this is just one giant setup?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.230
Well, good night.

35:22.246 --> 35:24.081
About time you come home.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.544
You out with that Feytek boy again?

35:29.712 --> 35:31.505
- Sasha.
- No!

35:31.672 --> 35:33.924
You may look like me...

35:34.800 --> 35:38.762
...but you take after your morn when
it comes to the boys, now, don't you?

35:38.929 --> 35:40.764
Hopefully with a little better taste.

35:43.309 --> 35:47.021
Damn it, girl,
you are gonna show me some respect.

35:54.028 --> 35:56.655
[GRUNTING]

36:01.952 --> 36:04.955
- I know Sara didn't have many friends.
- She's sort of a loner.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.373
But you were her friend.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.625
I like to think so, yes.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.378
But you have no idea
where she is now?

36:12.129 --> 36:13.339
No.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.592
This is a transcript
of the Scofield-Burrows videotape.

36:16.759 --> 36:19.636
I highlighted the part
where he talks directly to Sara.

36:21.138 --> 36:22.890
Mean anything to you?

36:23.766 --> 36:24.975
No.

36:25.142 --> 36:28.729
You have no idea where
she might meet him, if that's his plan?

36:30.397 --> 36:31.940
No.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.652
Is Brad Bellick
still here in the infirmary?

36:36.153 --> 36:37.404
Yeah. Why?

36:37.571 --> 36:40.157
You must be loving this.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.827
I didn't drive all this way to gloat.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.996
Well, then, what the hell
you come here for?

36:50.000 --> 36:53.170
First, I really gotta tip my cap to you.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.298
You've managed to draw a bead on
the convicts more than my own staff.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.841
Well, thanks for the "attaboy."

36:58.008 --> 37:01.970
But as you can see, the correctional
system doesn't share your gratitude.

37:03.013 --> 37:05.516
I won't take much of your time.
I have a few questions.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.184
- About?
- Sara Tancredi.

37:07.351 --> 37:10.312
She listed you as a reference
on her job application to work here.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.231
You know her well?

37:13.649 --> 37:17.528
I'd know her a lot better if you can
get my ass moved to ad seg.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.366
I have no influence with the DOC.
You know that.

37:23.492 --> 37:25.869
You want my help, you do.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.415
I'll talk to the warden,
see what I can do.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.500
Right after you give me some answers.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.878
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

37:36.547 --> 37:38.674
You recognize anything here?

37:38.841 --> 37:41.218
Anything that he may be
trying to tell her?

37:41.385 --> 37:44.054
No. I mean, he's saying he's sorry.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.850
Not that that's gonna do any good
with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.644
But...

37:51.562 --> 37:52.896
What?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.650
Ad seg.

38:02.406 --> 38:03.699
Yeah.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.077
You see here?

38:07.244 --> 38:10.664
Where it says this stuff about
"another chance" and "safe haven"?

38:10.831 --> 38:13.584
- That's out of the B/g <i>Book.</i>
- What big book?

38:13.750 --> 38:16.462
Alcoholics Anonymous.
Sara's in recovery.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.088
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

38:18.255 --> 38:20.257
Those are the names
of some of the chapters...

38:20.424 --> 38:22.301
...in the book they use in AA.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.761
Do you have a copy
of the Alcoholics Anonymous book?

<i>Sara, if you're listening. - .</i>

38:30.267 --> 38:32.519
<i>...I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

38:37.566 --> 38:41.153
<i>I can only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

38:44.698 --> 38:48.285
<i>I took advantage of you,
of your commitment to help others.</i>

38:50.120 --> 38:53.332
<i>I put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

38:56.293 --> 39:00.088
<i>I've considered many ways to apologize,
but I must arrive at one.</i>

39:04.927 --> 39:06.762
LINCOLN: It's getting late.
- I know.

39:06.929 --> 39:08.138
She's not here.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.390
I know that too.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.810
There is a chance
she didn't get the message.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.646
Or maybe she's just sick of all this.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.814
I mean, the girl bailed on you
back in Gila.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.902
What makes you think
she's gonna come running back now?

39:22.236 --> 39:25.989
The same thing that's been keeping us
going for the last three months.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.096
Right, she might be with him.
Just--

39:49.263 --> 39:53.183
Yes. Just call the local police in Akron
and tell them to get everyone they have...

39:53.350 --> 39:55.352
...over to St. Thomas Hospital now.

39:58.146 --> 40:02.943
Urn, Michael Crane.
I think you've got a phone call for me.

Here you go.

- Thank you.
- Um-hm.

This is Mr. Crane.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.039
It sounded better than origami.

40:16.456 --> 40:19.376
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

40:19.543 --> 40:22.879
I couldn't get to you in time.
This is the only thing I could think of.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.049
I swore I'd leave you alone...

40:26.633 --> 40:28.510
...but I had to contact you.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.221
Because I have something?

How'd you know?

40:33.890 --> 40:37.394
<i>Michael, back in Gila,
I was coming back to you.</i>

40:38.312 --> 40:40.439
Somebody grabbed me...

40:40.606 --> 40:44.026
...and they, urn, told me that my father
had given me something.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.833
That makes two of us.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.961
Do you think that's possible?

41:05.005 --> 41:06.256
With your help, yes.

41:06.423 --> 41:09.843
It's just a question of looking
at whatever it is your father gave you.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.470
It's just...

41:13.221 --> 41:14.556
It's just a key.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.267
Well, we'll figure it out.
