00:00.306 --> 00:02.706
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:06.016 --> 00:07.336
Knock, knock.

00:07.346 --> 00:09.366
You're going with Myka
as a backup.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.796
My first official assignment
as an Agent?

00:11.806 --> 00:13.906
As...An Apprentice.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.309
I'm ready to begin
my Apprentice education.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.240
You want juice, or are you
a milk person?

00:18.250 --> 00:19.170
You know what I'd really like?

00:19.180 --> 00:22.780
Oh I do indeed. But falling off
the wagon, may not be the best option

00:22.875 --> 00:23.909
at this point.

00:23.977 --> 00:26.211
No, no, what?

00:26.279 --> 00:28.981
We're just asking
because we're worried about you.

00:29.048 --> 00:30.549
I'm not drinking.

00:30.616 --> 00:33.485
How do we not end up
with our brains scrambled

00:33.553 --> 00:36.154
or whatever new way to die
there could be?

00:36.222 --> 00:38.223
Well, I mean,
look at the bright side.

00:38.291 --> 00:40.292
I'm usually
within ten feet of you,

00:40.360 --> 00:42.461
so whatever terrible thing
happens to you,

00:42.528 --> 00:43.929
will probably happen
to me too.

00:43.997 --> 00:45.263
Comforting.

[Both panting]

00:58.678 --> 01:00.512
What is this guy,
a jewel thief or a marathoner?

01:03.516 --> 01:05.417
If the artifact
let the thief

01:05.485 --> 01:07.452
walk into a jewelry store
and vanish,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.654
then why
isn't he vanishing now?

01:09.722 --> 01:11.256
Maybe he can't activate it
on the run,

01:11.324 --> 01:13.291
or maybe it doesn't do
what Artie thinks it does.

01:13.359 --> 01:14.726
[Cell phone rings]
That's Kelly.

01:14.794 --> 01:16.628
I told her I'd call
to discuss the weekend.

01:16.696 --> 01:17.796
I totally forgot.

01:17.864 --> 01:19.498
Whoa.

01:19.565 --> 01:20.732
Hello.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.267
Ah, careful,
just don't damage

01:22.335 --> 01:24.202
the one thing that Kelly's
looking forward to.

01:24.270 --> 01:26.338
Nah, little Pete's
made of steel.

01:26.406 --> 01:27.806
You go right,
I'll go left.

01:27.874 --> 01:31.143
Leena, this one is ready
to be shelved.

01:31.210 --> 01:32.644
A tin of sardines?

01:32.712 --> 01:34.579
Yes, it was part
of the Shackleton Expedition.

01:34.647 --> 01:36.448
They were trapped in the ice,
you know, for two years.

01:36.516 --> 01:39.017
They still had the good sense
not to open that.

01:39.085 --> 01:40.752
Had the sardines gone bad?

01:40.820 --> 01:42.487
Very bad.

01:42.555 --> 01:44.256
[Computer beeping]

01:44.323 --> 01:46.024
Artie, I-I just found
an anomaly.

01:46.092 --> 01:48.293
Uh, survey says
that insurance V.P.s in Hartford

01:48.361 --> 01:49.528
are donating big bucks
to charity,

01:49.595 --> 01:50.996
and it doesn't compute.

01:51.064 --> 01:53.231
It's not an anomaly.
It's a tax write-off.

01:53.299 --> 01:55.267
Yeah, but these guys gave away
50% of their bank accounts.

01:55.334 --> 01:57.803
I mean, the most
they donated before is 1%.

01:57.870 --> 01:59.104
That's a difference
of 49--

01:59.172 --> 02:00.972
I can subtract 1 from 50.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.874
That's why you're the boss.
Hartford.

02:02.942 --> 02:05.577
Artie, Artie, that could be
a Robin Hood artifact.

02:05.645 --> 02:06.978
Yes, it could.

02:07.046 --> 02:08.713
And the prize
for finding a case

02:08.781 --> 02:10.048
is a spin around
the Warehouse

02:10.116 --> 02:11.283
in Steve McQueen's
motorbike?

02:11.350 --> 02:12.684
No, but try
a free trip to Hartford,

02:12.752 --> 02:13.985
because Pete and Myka
are on the trail

02:14.053 --> 02:15.821
of a vanishing jewel thief
in Denver.

02:15.888 --> 02:19.691
So you and I will do
this investigation.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.660
You and I?
Really?

02:21.727 --> 02:23.295
Yeah.

02:23.362 --> 02:25.497
Well, I mean, I haven't had
a lot of time in the field,

02:25.565 --> 02:26.698
and you're--
I'm what?

02:26.766 --> 02:28.433
Uh, nothing.

02:28.501 --> 02:29.868
That was the end
of my sentence.

02:29.936 --> 02:31.403
Pack, 'cause we're leaving
right away.

02:31.471 --> 02:32.737
Where are my sunglasses?

02:32.805 --> 02:34.906
[Sighs] This is why
I pimped your specs.

02:34.974 --> 02:37.209
Just tap the ends
of the glasses together

02:37.276 --> 02:39.444
to complete the circuit.

02:39.512 --> 02:41.913
[Beeping]

02:41.981 --> 02:43.615
Oh.

02:43.683 --> 02:45.283
[Beeping continues]

02:47.386 --> 02:48.353
Ha.

02:48.421 --> 02:50.155
[Chuckles]

02:50.223 --> 02:51.656
Brava.

02:51.724 --> 02:54.326
That is, uh, very well done.
Well, we're a team.

02:54.393 --> 02:56.294
Claudia and Artie.

02:56.362 --> 02:57.596
"Clartie."
"Artia"?

02:57.663 --> 02:58.763

Yeah.

03:07.173 --> 03:09.641

You get him!

[Groans]

03:17.049 --> 03:19.384
Secret Service!

03:19.452 --> 03:20.385
What happened?

03:20.453 --> 03:21.553
Asian guy...

03:21.621 --> 03:23.221
Went out that window.

03:25.491 --> 03:28.160
What is with this guy
and windows?

03:29.729 --> 03:31.096
Hey.
Are you all right?

03:31.164 --> 03:33.465
Hey, Pete, this way!
[groans]

03:33.533 --> 03:34.566
Got it covered.

03:39.505 --> 03:40.572
Whoa.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.607
Oh, ow. Oh, ow.

03:42.675 --> 03:44.242
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.077
Ow, further than I thought.

03:46.145 --> 03:47.712
We lost him.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.282
Ow, but I bet we got
the artifact.

03:50.349 --> 03:53.785
Well, let's take a look
at it, then.

03:55.788 --> 03:58.256
Jeez, where's the drummer
and the fife?

03:58.324 --> 04:00.492
I just hurt my knee, okay?
And my shoulder.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.127
And I'm probably gonna have
a huge bruise on my--

04:02.195 --> 04:03.428
what is that?

04:03.496 --> 04:05.297
That is the world's smallest
purple violin.

04:05.364 --> 04:06.665
Oh.

04:06.732 --> 04:09.167
You know, one day
you're gonna make some lucky guy

04:09.235 --> 04:13.071
a very sarcastic wife.

04:13.139 --> 04:14.573
Ah.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.107
Half lion, half eagle.

04:16.175 --> 04:18.276
A Griffin.
I know.

04:18.344 --> 04:20.644
Well, did you know
that in Chinese Mythology

04:20.713 --> 04:22.079
they were used
to guard treasure?

04:22.148 --> 04:25.016
But somehow this one
helps people steal treasure

04:25.084 --> 04:27.652
and then make
a clean getaway.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.854
Oh, hey, speaking of,

04:29.922 --> 04:31.523
now that the mission
is accomplished,

04:31.591 --> 04:33.491
you can go
to your High-School Reunion

04:33.559 --> 04:34.893
and see some
of your old friends.

04:34.961 --> 04:37.028
[Both cheer sarcastically]

04:37.096 --> 04:39.631
You did--you did have friends
in High School, right?

04:39.699 --> 04:41.066
Oh, as a matter of fact,
Kurt Smoller,

04:41.133 --> 04:42.701
who is the Captain
of the football team,

04:42.768 --> 04:45.170
emailed me
and invited me personally.

04:45.238 --> 04:47.973
Wow, you and
a football Captain, huh?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.275
Yeah, yeah,
we hung out.

04:52.211 --> 04:54.045
Okay, I tutored him
in math.

04:54.113 --> 04:56.248
[Chuckles]
Well, that's perfect.

04:56.315 --> 04:59.618
Now you can go back
and show big, fat Kurt Smoller

04:59.685 --> 05:02.187
that smart girls
grow up pretty.

05:02.255 --> 05:04.022
Fine, I will go.

05:04.090 --> 05:06.391
Excellent.
[sighs]

05:06.459 --> 05:09.394
Now let's bag
old, uh, Kathy Griffin there,

05:09.462 --> 05:11.429
shall we?

05:11.497 --> 05:12.764
[Both chuckle]

05:19.505 --> 05:20.972
Ready?
Yep.

05:23.809 --> 05:25.410
Nothing to it.

05:25.478 --> 05:28.280
And now for two days,

05:28.347 --> 05:30.582
we get to pretend
we're normal.

Hey, Leena.
Hey, Pete.

06:17.997 --> 06:19.497
Wow, I didn't know
the Warehouse

06:19.565 --> 06:22.434
had a canned-food aisle.

06:22.501 --> 06:24.469
Ooh, red herrings, huh?

06:24.537 --> 06:27.539
Bet that case
was really hard to solve.

06:27.606 --> 06:30.175
Did you hurt your leg?

06:30.242 --> 06:31.409
I did.

06:31.477 --> 06:33.278
I, uh, twisted it
nabbing the Griffin,

06:33.346 --> 06:35.547
which I put
on Artie's desk.

06:35.614 --> 06:37.182
I didn't see him
or Claudia.

06:37.249 --> 06:38.983
They're in Hartford
on a mission.

06:39.051 --> 06:40.618
Pete, put that back.

06:40.686 --> 06:44.756
That's the original
can of worms.

06:44.824 --> 06:47.492
All right,
well, 3:00 on a Friday,

06:47.560 --> 06:48.993
so I'm calling it.

06:49.061 --> 06:50.995
I will see you on Monday.

06:51.063 --> 06:52.297
Take care of that leg.

06:52.365 --> 06:54.199
And you should stay
in bed all weekend.

06:54.266 --> 06:55.767
My plan exactly.

06:55.835 --> 06:57.602
Ow, ow, ow.

07:03.342 --> 07:06.111
I think that the donation
is suspicious, that's all.

07:06.178 --> 07:07.545
I've done nothing wrong.

07:07.613 --> 07:09.814
I gave money to fund
free clinics across the country.

07:09.882 --> 07:10.815
That's a good thing.

07:10.883 --> 07:11.950
Yeah, it's a good thing,

07:12.017 --> 07:13.184
if you did it
of your own free will,

07:13.252 --> 07:15.453
but I get a feeling
that your wife

07:15.521 --> 07:16.821
wasn't too thrilled
with that decision.

07:16.889 --> 07:19.491
Well, what makes you
think that?

07:25.598 --> 07:29.067
Okay, she was upset
with my sudden generosity,

07:29.135 --> 07:31.536
but that's because she didn't
understand why I did it.

07:31.604 --> 07:33.638
Why did you do it?

07:33.706 --> 07:37.375
I don't have to answer
to you or my wife.

07:37.443 --> 07:38.610
Is there another woman?

07:38.677 --> 07:40.145
No.

07:40.212 --> 07:43.014
There's only one woman
for me.

07:47.086 --> 07:48.453
Okay.

07:48.521 --> 07:51.589
Claudia, I think
that we could be dealing

07:51.657 --> 07:53.124
with a home-wrecking
artifact.

07:53.192 --> 07:55.193
Two of the V.P.s
have filed for divorce.

07:55.261 --> 07:56.494
Oh, make that three.

07:56.562 --> 07:58.163
The V.P. of Product Operations

07:58.230 --> 08:00.098
just called off
his engagement.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.433
You got that
off the Internet?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.535
Social networking,
but old school.

08:03.602 --> 08:05.637
Teri the receptionist
is chatty.

08:05.704 --> 08:07.605

So if, uh, Lewis calls--

08:07.673 --> 08:09.274
listen, aside
from these donations,

08:09.341 --> 08:11.176
what else do these
Truehart executives

08:11.243 --> 08:12.243
have in common?

08:12.311 --> 08:13.678
Well, one thing.

08:13.746 --> 08:15.580
I cross-checked their
recent credit card charges.

08:15.648 --> 08:18.016
Hansen's Bar showed up
on all three expense accounts.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.851
Can you pull up
the receipts?

08:19.919 --> 08:21.219
Observe.

08:21.287 --> 08:22.921
Okay.

08:22.988 --> 08:25.123
Well, each of these guys met
with the same person.

08:25.191 --> 08:26.424
You know that how?

08:26.492 --> 08:27.525
Because look,
on each receipt,

08:27.593 --> 08:30.161
apple moto.

08:30.229 --> 08:33.597
Are any of these Truehart
executives not affected?

08:37.870 --> 08:39.437
John Donley.

08:39.505 --> 08:41.806
Oh, wait.
Oh, pickles!

08:41.874 --> 08:43.842
That was just him with teri.
We should go warn him.

08:43.909 --> 08:45.410
No, no, no,
we should track him,

08:45.478 --> 08:47.645
'cause he could be
the mojito drinker.

08:47.713 --> 08:49.547
See if you can hack
into the garage cameras--

08:49.615 --> 08:52.050
Hey, Teri.

08:52.117 --> 08:53.585
John say where he was headed?

08:53.652 --> 08:55.353
Hansen's Bar for a drink
with a client.

08:55.421 --> 08:56.588
You should try it.

08:56.655 --> 08:58.189
They have the best
happy-hour clam bar.

08:58.257 --> 08:59.958
You feel like clams?

09:00.025 --> 09:03.461
I feel a little clammy, yes.
Yeah, okay.

09:07.967 --> 09:10.502

09:10.569 --> 09:13.338

09:13.405 --> 09:17.075

09:19.578 --> 09:21.379
Hey, sorry about the knee--

09:21.447 --> 09:24.516
kind of, you know,
limits my moves a little.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.050
No complaints,

09:26.118 --> 09:27.585
unless you were faking it

09:27.653 --> 09:29.220
so I had to do
most of the work.

09:29.288 --> 09:30.655
Why--

09:30.723 --> 09:32.857
why don't women
ever believe me?

09:32.925 --> 09:34.959
Let's not get into that.

09:35.027 --> 09:36.127
Don't worry.

09:36.195 --> 09:39.797
We won't go dancing tonight.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.585
I'm actually quite nice.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.420
Oh, your charms
aren't gonna work on me, Lady.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.556
Sorry.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.126
You sure you don't see
something you like?

21:35.194 --> 21:37.829
No, I'm here on business.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.764
It's time you start
answering my questions.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.677
It's done.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.012
That's why
you're the master.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.580
Did you get the artifact?
No, no, she's clean.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.914
Let's go.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.149
Hold on.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.420
So, Artie, what's our next move?
Who's our next suspect?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.522
I told you,
the investigation is over.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.424
Well, those men
gave their fortunes away.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.892
For a good cause.
You stay away from her.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.128
What?
She's mine.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.864
Artie!

22:12.931 --> 22:15.266
Back off, Donley.
She loves me now.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.734
What? Artie?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.503
I am gonna Tesla him
until he is impotent.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.405
Artie, stop.
She's gotten to you.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.273
Just stay out of this.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.941
I'm taking you down.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.810
Guys, listen.
Claudia, get out of my way.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.512
Hey, that's her car.

22:27.579 --> 22:29.280
Lauren!

22:29.348 --> 22:31.282
Lauren, wait for me!
Lauren!

22:35.454 --> 22:38.156
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.358
Call 911!

22:40.426 --> 22:42.493
Oh, my God.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.029
She should be more careful.
She could get hurt.

22:49.351 --> 22:51.152
[Sighs, belches]
Seriously, though,

22:51.219 --> 22:53.254
you--you actually like
<i>The Three Stooges?</i>

22:54.881 --> 22:56.049
Yeah.

22:56.064 --> 22:57.297
Who's your favorite Joe?

22:57.365 --> 22:58.799
Well, I would have
to go with Besser

22:58.867 --> 23:00.434
over de Rita,

23:00.502 --> 23:02.102
although nobody can hold
a candle to Curly.

23:02.170 --> 23:04.838
"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
A wise guy, eh?"

23:04.906 --> 23:06.173
[Rolls tongue]

23:06.241 --> 23:07.341
[Chuckles]

23:07.409 --> 23:09.877
[Barking]

23:09.944 --> 23:11.278
[Laughs]

23:11.346 --> 23:13.147
Okay, don't take this
the wrong way,

23:13.214 --> 23:15.015
but until tonight,
I had no idea

23:15.083 --> 23:16.383
you were so much fun.

23:16.451 --> 23:20.287
Dude, until tonight,
I wasn't that much fun.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.222
Okay, there's something
special happening here, right?

23:22.290 --> 23:23.424
Do you feel this?

23:23.491 --> 23:24.925
You don't know
the half of it.

23:31.332 --> 23:32.966
Dude.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.568
What the hell?

23:34.636 --> 23:37.004
I thought you wanted me to.

23:37.071 --> 23:40.507
No! Jeez!

23:40.575 --> 23:42.209
Crap.

23:42.277 --> 23:43.377
I'm a chick.

23:43.445 --> 23:45.145
Pete!

23:46.714 --> 23:49.983
I got to go.

23:50.051 --> 23:50.884
Ugh.

23:58.660 --> 24:00.394
Okay.

24:00.462 --> 24:02.563
O-okay, Pete, Pete, Pete.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.765
Just let me do it.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.567
Jeez, I haven't had a drink
in eight years.

24:06.634 --> 24:08.836
The buzz lasts a little bit
longer than I remember.

24:08.903 --> 24:10.838
Oh, is that why you kissed
my High-School crush?

24:10.905 --> 24:15.008
Ow, I didn't kiss him.
He kissed me.

24:15.076 --> 24:18.111
Wait, Kurt likes me?

24:18.179 --> 24:19.513
No, he likes me.

24:19.581 --> 24:22.115
He thinks
you're a giganto-nerd.

24:22.183 --> 24:23.283
Right.

24:23.351 --> 24:24.885
We'll fix this.

24:24.953 --> 24:26.286
Whoa, me first,
I gotta take a leak.

24:26.354 --> 24:27.721
Don't forget to sit down.

24:27.789 --> 24:29.923
And don't touch anything.

24:33.528 --> 24:35.429
Dark reeling feeling...

24:35.497 --> 24:36.830
Artie, I just found
something huge.

24:36.898 --> 24:38.765
What rhymes with "adorable"?

24:38.833 --> 24:39.967
Deplorable.

24:40.034 --> 24:41.301
No.

24:41.369 --> 24:43.136
More--more able to--
passionate.

24:43.204 --> 24:44.471
Stop writing poetry.
No, I can't stop.

24:44.539 --> 24:45.739
Hey, I need your brain.

24:45.807 --> 24:47.140
I just found out
Lauren's brother died

24:47.208 --> 24:48.542
six months ago
of liver disease.

24:48.610 --> 24:49.843
His request
for a transplant

24:49.911 --> 24:51.411
was denied
by his insurance.

24:51.479 --> 24:52.613
Do you want to guess
who the provider was?

24:52.680 --> 24:54.147
Truehart.

24:54.215 --> 24:55.883
Yes.
So it was a revenge thing.

24:55.950 --> 24:57.050
And who can blame her?

24:57.118 --> 24:58.719
We can!
No.

24:58.786 --> 25:00.654
Apparently
the money's not enough.

25:00.722 --> 25:02.055
She wants their lives.
You know, when I see her,

25:02.123 --> 25:03.724
I'll ask her to stop
wanting their lives,

25:03.791 --> 25:05.259
and she'll do it
because she's sweet.

25:05.326 --> 25:07.528
Holy gams, Batman,
that's how she's doing it.

25:07.595 --> 25:09.229
"Rangel"?
Artie, look at this.

25:09.297 --> 25:11.665
You touched Lauren's leg.
John Donley touched it too.

25:11.733 --> 25:14.034
I think "adorable" is better.
Look at that.

25:14.102 --> 25:15.736
Don't show me another man
groping my Lauren.

25:15.803 --> 25:17.104
Oh, that man's
in the hospital

25:17.171 --> 25:19.206
with five broken ribs,
and you could be next.

25:19.274 --> 25:21.542
What can you tell me
about Lauren's leg?

25:25.413 --> 25:27.548
That the only thing
that stops it going on forever

25:27.615 --> 25:29.516
is the floor.

25:29.584 --> 25:31.952
Silky smooth
and subtly soft.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.787
Ooh, I like "subtly soft."

25:33.855 --> 25:34.955
Silky smooth.

25:35.023 --> 25:36.256
Ah, so maybe
it's a body cream

25:36.324 --> 25:38.091
that she's using
to turn men into stalkers.

25:38.159 --> 25:40.193
Stalker...

25:40.261 --> 25:41.795
No.

25:41.863 --> 25:44.298
Would a stalker go to her house
in the middle of the night

25:44.365 --> 25:46.066
to read her poetry?

25:46.134 --> 25:48.135
Oh, Artie,
you can't go over there...

25:48.202 --> 25:50.304
Without a shower.

25:50.371 --> 25:53.807
You're all stinky
from artifact hunting.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.475
Oh, yes,
it has been a long day.

25:55.543 --> 25:56.743
Gamy, right?

25:56.811 --> 25:59.880
Take a shower, yeah,
but not a cold one.

26:03.051 --> 26:04.518
Well, Leena's looking
into it,

26:04.586 --> 26:05.852
but what do we do
in the meantime?

26:05.920 --> 26:08.622
Let's go over the Griffin.

26:08.690 --> 26:12.225
There could be something.

26:12.293 --> 26:14.294
All right.

26:23.471 --> 26:25.872
Just--

26:30.078 --> 26:32.512
a metal flap.

26:32.580 --> 26:33.780
That's it.

26:33.848 --> 26:35.782
Is it?

26:35.850 --> 26:38.952
Yes. Yes, it means
it's--it's a bookend

26:39.020 --> 26:40.587
and not a statue.

26:40.655 --> 26:42.122
And bookends
come in pairs.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.458
And if there's another one,
the thief probably has it.

26:44.525 --> 26:45.692
He could be anywhere by now.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.995
No, uh, wait, Leena said

26:48.062 --> 26:49.830
that when she put
the Griffin down

26:49.897 --> 26:51.898
it rotated.

26:58.139 --> 26:59.439
[Gasps]

26:59.507 --> 27:01.942
It--it looks like--
like it's pointing,

27:02.010 --> 27:03.377
like--like a compass.

27:03.444 --> 27:04.778
Well, maybe it'll lead us
to its mate

27:04.846 --> 27:07.280
in some dualistic attraction.

27:07.348 --> 27:09.516
Come on,
let's hit the road.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.418
Oh, and could you change
out of my dress?

27:11.486 --> 27:12.552
I just bought that today.

27:12.620 --> 27:13.887
Jeez.

27:15.556 --> 27:16.757
[Cell phone rings]

27:16.824 --> 27:18.759
[Gasps]

27:18.826 --> 27:20.360
Oh, that's--that's Kelly.

27:20.428 --> 27:21.762
Oh, shoot.

27:21.829 --> 27:23.563
I said I'd call her.

27:23.631 --> 27:24.898
Aha.

27:24.966 --> 27:27.401
So it's not
just a guy thing.

27:27.468 --> 27:28.869
Hi, Kelly.

27:28.936 --> 27:30.671
Yeah, it's--it's me...

27:30.738 --> 27:31.705
Pete.

27:31.773 --> 27:33.473
Um...

27:33.541 --> 27:36.410
Hey, you know, I-I know
that I said that I'd call you,

27:36.477 --> 27:38.078
but I forgot.

27:38.146 --> 27:40.647
And, uh, so I want to make--

27:40.715 --> 27:42.482
I want to make it up to you
with this promise.

27:42.550 --> 27:43.583
What?
No promises.

27:43.651 --> 27:44.985
No, Myka.

27:45.053 --> 27:46.319
Myka, no promises.

27:46.387 --> 27:47.921
Uh, yes, let me--

27:47.989 --> 27:50.223
let me get
someplace private.

27:50.291 --> 27:52.359
Fresh as a Daisy

27:52.427 --> 27:54.594
and a little less formal

27:54.662 --> 27:56.797
and slightly slimming.

27:56.864 --> 27:58.465
And all you need
is your hat.

27:58.533 --> 28:01.001
Ooh, good idea.

28:01.069 --> 28:02.736
All right--
what are you doing?

28:02.804 --> 28:04.571
No, Claudia!
Knock, knock.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.106
Just like old times.

28:06.174 --> 28:07.374
Claudia!

28:07.442 --> 28:08.909
It's for your own
protection, Artie.

28:08.976 --> 28:12.012
I'm going to Lauren's to do
what Warehouse agents do--

28:12.080 --> 28:14.147
get the artifact.

28:14.215 --> 28:16.083
If you hurt Lauren,
I will hunt you down.

28:16.150 --> 28:18.218
Mm-hmm.

28:18.286 --> 28:19.853
Pwned.

28:19.921 --> 28:21.488
God, how can you stand
this hair?

28:21.556 --> 28:22.956
I just want
to cut it off.

28:23.024 --> 28:25.726
You do that, and I will
shave your entire body.

28:25.793 --> 28:27.227
Ugh.
Use the hair tie.

28:27.295 --> 28:28.662
It's on my right arm.

28:28.730 --> 28:31.164
So--I just thought
it was an ugly bracelet.

28:31.232 --> 28:34.801
So what do--what do I do?

28:37.438 --> 28:40.674
Turn.

28:40.742 --> 28:42.743
[Sighs]
So what'd you promise Kelly?

28:42.810 --> 28:45.345
Well, you will find out.

28:45.413 --> 28:47.214
Oh, my God, your hands
are so clumsy.

28:47.281 --> 28:48.448
Ow!

28:48.516 --> 28:51.952
There.

28:52.019 --> 28:53.420
Look at that.

28:53.488 --> 28:55.055
What is it doing?

28:57.024 --> 28:58.725
Hey.

28:58.793 --> 29:00.060
You have
the other Griffin.

29:00.128 --> 29:01.695
You were right.
There are two of 'em.

29:01.763 --> 29:03.463
Security guard.

29:03.531 --> 29:05.265
You and the thief
were working together.

29:05.333 --> 29:06.533
Wrong again.

29:06.601 --> 29:08.602
We are together.

29:08.669 --> 29:10.704
And we've been looking
all over town for you.

29:10.772 --> 29:13.206
I really don't like
where this is going.

29:17.059 --> 29:18.793
I need
the other Griffin now.

29:18.861 --> 29:20.295
No!
First you show us--

29:20.370 --> 29:22.137
there's no time.

29:24.407 --> 29:26.842
Myka, grab the Griffin.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.544
Whoa, I'm me again.

29:28.611 --> 29:31.346
Myka, where are you?

29:31.414 --> 29:33.148
I'm back to myself.

29:33.216 --> 29:34.349
This just got easier.

29:34.417 --> 29:36.118
Wrong.
He's the nice one.

29:36.185 --> 29:37.819
So am I.

29:51.067 --> 29:52.935
Now we're
sharing one body too.

29:53.002 --> 29:54.436
Pete?

29:54.504 --> 29:57.406
Pete, we have got
to fix this.

29:57.473 --> 29:59.141
Yeah, tell me about it.

30:13.456 --> 30:15.324
Oh, hi.
I work with Artie.

30:15.391 --> 30:17.159
Get out of here.
No can do.

30:17.226 --> 30:19.428
Two men are in the hospital,
and you're still on the loose.

30:19.495 --> 30:20.696
That wasn't my fault.

30:20.763 --> 30:23.432
I saw you hit John Donley
with your car.

30:23.499 --> 30:25.767
That wasn't me driving.
Then who was it?

30:25.835 --> 30:28.337
Me.

30:28.404 --> 30:30.005
Told you to get
out of here.

30:30.073 --> 30:31.406
[Groaning]

30:31.474 --> 30:34.276
Sharing the same body now.
Great.

30:34.344 --> 30:36.445
Should make Myka do this.

30:36.512 --> 30:39.881
[Grunts]

30:39.949 --> 30:41.316
Really?

30:41.384 --> 30:44.419
Just when I could've used
the upper-body strength.

30:44.487 --> 30:45.821
[Knock at door]

30:45.888 --> 30:48.857
[Breathing heavily]

30:52.462 --> 30:53.895
Hey, you're still up.

30:53.963 --> 30:55.631
Kurt.

30:55.698 --> 30:57.566
This is a really bad time
for a Booty call.

30:57.634 --> 30:58.934
What makes you think
it's a Booty call?

30:59.002 --> 31:00.202
Well, what else
would it be?

31:02.939 --> 31:03.839
Busted.

31:03.906 --> 31:05.173
Can I come in?

31:05.241 --> 31:06.875
No, no, you can't.

31:06.943 --> 31:10.345

why or how they work,

they'll do anything I ask.

He was about to shoot me and--

Claudia.

35:08.985 --> 35:11.754
That prism
was meant for you.

that she could outsmart me,

you're out last hope.

35:29.272 --> 35:30.572
We just learned the hard way

35:30.640 --> 35:32.574
that two things
can't occupy the same space.

35:32.642 --> 35:34.443
Okay, I looked
into split personalities,

35:34.511 --> 35:36.578
which led me
to Robert Louis Stevenson,

35:36.646 --> 35:38.213
who wrote
<i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</i>

35:38.281 --> 35:39.648
Going through his notes,

35:39.716 --> 35:41.583
I found a picture
of him in his study.

35:41.651 --> 35:43.118
Can we move this along?

35:43.186 --> 35:44.720
I'm starting to get
a really...

35:44.788 --> 35:46.989
Bad vibe.

35:47.057 --> 35:49.658
So that's what
vibes feel like.

35:49.726 --> 35:50.659
Huh.

35:50.727 --> 35:52.728
On the shelf behind him,

35:52.796 --> 35:54.029
there's two bookends.

35:54.097 --> 35:54.997
Griffins?

35:55.065 --> 35:57.299
No, one is an eagle.

35:57.367 --> 35:59.601
And the other is a lion.

35:59.669 --> 36:01.870
It seemed like such
a coincidence--

36:01.938 --> 36:03.038
maybe the bookends
on the mantel

36:03.106 --> 36:04.740
are in an inactive state.

36:04.808 --> 36:06.709
What if the heads
can be switched,

36:06.776 --> 36:08.744

Could be reversed?

What you said on the phone

42:26.441 --> 42:29.343
is the sweetest thing
a guy has ever said to me.

42:29.411 --> 42:32.146
I bet you don't even remember
the exact words.

42:32.214 --> 42:34.248
Oh, I remember.

42:34.316 --> 42:36.450
No man has ever understood me
like that.

42:36.518 --> 42:38.552
I'm so glad that--

42:38.620 --> 42:41.989
that you're...

42:42.057 --> 42:43.824
You.

42:43.892 --> 42:46.594
Me too.

42:46.661 --> 42:49.563
But--but--but, uh, you know
what would be really fun?

42:49.631 --> 42:50.698
Oh-oh.

42:50.765 --> 42:52.499
Oh!
[giggles]

42:55.770 --> 42:57.204
Yeah, yeah.

42:57.272 --> 42:58.906
Why don't you say back to me

42:58.974 --> 43:00.741
what I said on the phone?

43:00.809 --> 43:03.777
And then I'll grade you
for accuracy.

43:09.317 --> 43:11.151
Or--or not.
