00:00.219 --> 00:02.831
When women in Chatswin
want to look their best,

00:03.543 --> 00:05.764
sometimes they have to play dirty.

00:06.421 --> 00:09.822
No Majorqua, I want vampy not trampy.

00:09.823 --> 00:11.715
If you paint my nails with this color,

00:11.770 --> 00:13.780
George will think he asked out a 10-minute whore.

00:13.788 --> 00:16.094
- Mommy?
- I'm sorry Dalia.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.917
And Majorqua. It's just...

00:17.964 --> 00:20.838
I've waited all lifetime for
George Altman to ask me on a date.

00:20.839 --> 00:21.839
And I guess I'm just a little...

00:22.782 --> 00:23.986
- Nervous.
- Why?

00:24.017 --> 00:26.215
You've dated plenty of
men who are better looking

00:26.231 --> 00:28.866
and sexier and beefier
and brawnier and more cut

00:28.921 --> 00:29.993
and darker-skinned and longer hair,

00:30.001 --> 00:30.775
and taller and richer

00:30.783 --> 00:32.777
and more successful, and
funnier and friendlier,

00:32.785 --> 00:34.598
who have more summer homes and foreign cars

00:34.599 --> 00:36.717
and motorboats and yachts,
who are more well-traveled

00:36.718 --> 00:38.025
and know more languages than him.

00:38.064 --> 00:41.708
I know. I know. I guess
I'm just nervous, is all.

00:41.828 --> 00:42.787
Can't a woman be nervous?

00:42.803 --> 00:44.969
He's the one who should be nervous, mommy.

00:45.089 --> 00:48.333
If you ask me, George Altman
landed in the tall grass.

00:48.453 --> 00:50.468
All right, which one says,

00:50.588 --> 00:52.672
"I can't live a moment without you.

00:52.673 --> 00:54.345
Don't even think about asking for a raise"?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.340
Well, if I'm not mistaken,

00:55.348 --> 00:58.164
I believe the traditional
2-week nanny gift is pearls,

00:58.210 --> 00:59.927
but I can check my Emily Post.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.696
This woman is amazing, George.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.108
She is so attuned to my baby.

01:05.132 --> 01:08.135
It's like she baked him
in her own meat oven.

01:08.153 --> 01:09.723
Wow. That's beautiful.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.586
You should get that
engraved on the necklace.

01:11.608 --> 01:13.556
She's cooped up in the house all day.

01:13.595 --> 01:14.925
She deserves a night out.

01:14.971 --> 01:17.911
So when I saw that the Chappaqua Opera

01:17.929 --> 01:20.347
was performing "Carmen,"
I thought finally, finally,

01:20.381 --> 01:23.371
someone wrote an opera to take
your nanny named Carmen to.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.593
What do you have planned for Dallas?

01:26.601 --> 01:27.455
Oh, not much.

01:27.489 --> 01:29.623
We'll probably just grab some dinner,

01:29.657 --> 01:31.496
you know, maybe go for a walk.

01:31.616 --> 01:32.247
A walk?

01:32.248 --> 01:33.826
Look, me and Dallas are way past

01:33.850 --> 01:35.490
the "trying to impress each other" stage.

01:35.610 --> 01:38.732
You know, we can just relax
and enjoy each other's company.

01:39.222 --> 01:40.990
Don't worry, Noah. I got this.

01:41.044 --> 01:43.054
Seriously? You're not
gonna knock on something?

01:45.041 --> 01:47.152
All right, I got the
bling. I got the tickets.

01:47.272 --> 01:48.810
The only thing I have left...

01:49.006 --> 01:50.460
Mm. I need a sitter for Opus.

01:50.484 --> 01:53.025
There's gotta be a neighborhood
kid you can ask to watch him.

01:53.557 --> 01:54.754
Mm. Have to be mature,

01:54.809 --> 01:56.842
- trustworthy...
- Yeah. Smart, resourceful...

01:56.897 --> 01:58.633
Ideally somebody I already know.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.799
Okay. Whatever. I'll do it.

02:00.815 --> 02:01.705
- What?
- No, we won't...

02:01.706 --> 02:02.966
Look, I'm free this weekend...

02:03.086 --> 02:04.811
not by choice, but whatever. It's cool.

02:04.812 --> 02:07.407
Uh, w... no. I mean, that's...

02:07.439 --> 02:09.894
I think that's very nice,
but I wasn't fishing.

02:10.014 --> 02:11.893
I can use the extra cash.

02:12.013 --> 02:12.843
Huh. No.

02:12.898 --> 02:15.282
I mean, I just don't know
that you're the right fit.

02:15.317 --> 02:16.433
What?

02:16.468 --> 02:17.441
Do you hear this, George?

02:17.457 --> 02:18.857
- Yeah, Tess, here's the thing...
- Really?

02:18.865 --> 02:20.881
Babies are very demanding.
As an only child,

02:20.882 --> 02:21.993
you don't have a ton of experience...

02:21.994 --> 02:24.730
I excelled at my job, I
am an excellent student,

02:24.949 --> 02:27.623
I just spent the summer
rooming with a geriatric woman.

02:27.678 --> 02:30.814
I think... I can handle a baby.

02:56.004 --> 02:58.452
- Easy on the hard cider, Fred.
- Easy-peasy.

02:58.491 --> 02:59.320
You only get one.

02:59.351 --> 03:01.401
One's all I need. I'm a cheap date.

03:01.521 --> 03:03.559
You rock, dad.

03:03.942 --> 03:05.827
Ryan?

03:05.947 --> 03:08.290
Why don't you be the boot tonight?

03:10.636 --> 03:12.380
Lisa?

03:13.186 --> 03:14.766
You never let me be the boot.

03:14.773 --> 03:16.080
You never let Ryan be the boot.

03:16.081 --> 03:18.488
I know. I just thought...

03:18.778 --> 03:21.217
maybe it's time Ryan was the boot.

03:21.710 --> 03:24.240
Ryan, go get your father
another hard cider.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.801
- He only gets one.
- Just do it.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.171
Oh, yeah.

03:31.571 --> 03:32.595
Lisa Marie,

03:32.611 --> 03:34.251
you can't start treating Ryan differently

03:34.252 --> 03:35.661
now that you know he's adopted.

03:35.692 --> 03:37.123
He's liable to suspect something.

03:37.131 --> 03:38.758
Look, mother, I am trying to manufacture

03:38.766 --> 03:40.549
a feeling of closeness
between Ryan and myself

03:40.550 --> 03:42.137
so that if he ever does find out,

03:42.184 --> 03:44.569
we won't lose him to a better family.

03:44.689 --> 03:47.455
I will not be left alone
with the two of you.

03:47.486 --> 03:49.658
He will know something's up,
if you keep acting like a...

03:49.659 --> 03:50.645
top hat!

03:50.765 --> 03:53.186
I guess I'll be the top hat!

03:53.218 --> 03:54.930
- She's gonna be the top hat.
- Why not?

03:54.962 --> 03:57.887
- Sheila in a top hat! 
- Hey! 

04:03.767 --> 04:04.831
Hey, Dalia.

04:04.886 --> 04:06.098
Hey.

04:08.788 --> 04:10.423
Is your mother ready?

04:10.626 --> 04:11.940
Almost.

04:12.060 --> 04:14.040
She likes to make an entrance.

04:32.266 --> 04:33.821
Wow. Y... you look...

04:33.822 --> 04:35.441
Wait for it.

04:42.918 --> 04:44.255
Magical?

04:44.443 --> 04:46.336
Uh, w... what?

04:46.456 --> 04:50.535
I was finishing your sentence.
You said, "you look... magical?"

04:50.590 --> 04:52.404
Oh. O... okay.

04:52.524 --> 04:53.444
Magical.

04:53.499 --> 04:55.079
You're too kind, George.

04:55.126 --> 04:57.339
What's that? I'm sorry.
The music is a little loud.

04:57.370 --> 04:59.161
Dalia.

04:59.192 --> 05:00.999
I said you're too kind.

05:01.437 --> 05:04.354
So... where will you be taking me tonight?

05:04.370 --> 05:06.981
Uh, well, uh, Chef Alan recommended

05:06.982 --> 05:08.726
this really great spot
down by the train yard.

05:08.780 --> 05:10.741
It's got homemade charcuterie, so...

05:10.742 --> 05:11.431
Char-whatery?

05:11.455 --> 05:13.499
Oh, it's like...

05:13.533 --> 05:14.309
meats.

05:14.429 --> 05:15.601
Ew.

05:15.635 --> 05:17.236
Meats?

05:17.270 --> 05:18.921
Is that okay?

05:18.972 --> 05:20.006
I guess.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.372
Here.

05:22.226 --> 05:24.680
I'm just worried that
I might be disappointed,

05:24.688 --> 05:27.127
and if I'm disappointed, I
might have a hard time hiding it,

05:27.128 --> 05:29.318
and then that might make
you feel uncomfortable,

05:29.357 --> 05:31.407
and then you'll be wondering
what's bothering me,

05:31.430 --> 05:33.621
when all along, it was just
on account of the meats.

05:33.629 --> 05:35.821
What kind of a sadist designed this coat?

05:35.839 --> 05:38.579
Careful. The lining is pony eyelash.

05:38.618 --> 05:39.607
Pony eyelash?

05:39.580 --> 05:41.324
Oh, no, George. I know
what you're thinking.

05:41.356 --> 05:44.053
They're humanely collected
from the floors of stables.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.461
Thank God.

05:45.462 --> 05:47.267
So may I be honest, George?

05:47.322 --> 05:49.653
I really don't want to
eat at a filthy restaurant

05:49.700 --> 05:51.263
by a train yard.

05:51.264 --> 05:53.195
Well, Dallas, I'm...
I'm... I'm... I'm happy

05:53.242 --> 05:54.303
to take you anywhere you like.

05:54.423 --> 05:55.341
Perfect.

05:55.359 --> 05:58.240
Let's you and I get our
lobster bisque on, shall we?

05:58.287 --> 05:59.295
After me.

05:59.346 --> 06:01.477
Dating Dallas Royce was turning out to be

06:01.478 --> 06:03.166
as elaborate as a production of "Carmen."

06:03.190 --> 06:04.527
Don't you cry.

06:04.543 --> 06:06.686
If you cry, then I'm gonna cry.

06:06.806 --> 06:09.142
If he cries, sing him Phil Collins.

06:09.173 --> 06:11.480
I didn't anticipate how
hard this was gonna be.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.966
He likes "Sussudio" best.

06:12.990 --> 06:14.202
Relax, guys.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.485
I got this.

06:15.605 --> 06:17.441
Even if you just say the word,

06:17.472 --> 06:19.388
it seems to calm his
nerves for some reason.

06:19.576 --> 06:21.445
Opus and I...

06:21.565 --> 06:23.884
we are as cool as cucumbers.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.675
Look at her. She's gonna be great.

06:25.902 --> 06:28.053
Oh. I almost forgot.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.891
The security system has been down all week.

06:30.011 --> 06:31.838
But don't worry. The house is so secluded,

06:31.807 --> 06:33.019
you'd have to be a real psychopath

06:33.027 --> 06:34.810
to hike up here to steal anything.

06:34.849 --> 06:37.397
I should know 'cause they
caught a guy doing it once.

06:37.422 --> 06:38.901
He was nuts.

06:38.952 --> 06:41.645
An incredible collection of knives, though,

06:42.091 --> 06:44.366
and a face tattoo that still haunts me.

06:46.595 --> 06:48.518
Carmen, shall we?

06:49.589 --> 06:51.428
Oh. The lights are on the timer,

06:51.459 --> 06:53.868
so don't be surprised if you
find yourself in the dark.

06:53.915 --> 06:56.368
Okay. Bye.

07:05.378 --> 07:10.032
♪ There's a girl that's been on my mind ♪

07:10.066 --> 07:12.084

07:25.252 --> 07:27.207
So why are you giving me your room again?

07:27.327 --> 07:28.942
Well, because I love you.

07:28.966 --> 07:31.124
Yeah, but you love your room more.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.517
You're in here, like, all the time,

07:33.572 --> 07:36.192
like, whenever I'm out doing
fun things with friends,

07:36.215 --> 07:37.678
you're in here,

07:38.053 --> 07:39.320
spending time with your room.

07:39.351 --> 07:42.722
Well, it is the better
room, and you deserve it.

07:42.964 --> 07:45.436
I want you to enjoy your time here.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.041
What's that supposed to mean?

07:51.136 --> 07:53.694
It just means you can
have whatever you want.

07:53.709 --> 07:55.352
- Can I have your sweater?
- If you want it.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.197
- Can I have a snake?
- I won't block it.

07:57.228 --> 07:58.651
Can I have Tessa Altman?

07:58.886 --> 08:00.622
Have her do what?

08:00.896 --> 08:02.773
Everything.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.567
I think it's pretty obvious.

08:07.911 --> 08:09.468
She's my moose.

08:09.499 --> 08:10.383
Your muse?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.853
- She's my jam.
- She isn't.

08:11.973 --> 08:14.426
She's what I want, Lisa.

08:15.474 --> 08:17.797
So are you gonna help me get her or not?

08:18.328 --> 08:21.652
Why is every primetime TV show
about a gruesome crime scene?

08:22.309 --> 08:24.585
What is wrong with you, America?

08:28.253 --> 08:30.459
Your dad probably just forgot his wallet.

08:34.385 --> 08:36.121
And his keys to the house.

08:38.663 --> 08:40.852
There's nothing to be afraid of, Opus.

08:54.984 --> 08:57.431
- Hello?
- Good evening.

08:57.483 --> 08:59.335
I'm the Hillside Electrical Strangler.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.080
I'm looking for Mr. Wiener.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.433
Uh, no Wiener here. Sorry.

09:03.464 --> 09:05.503
You sure? I got a call for help.

09:05.774 --> 09:07.443
It came from inside this house.

09:07.563 --> 09:09.745
You listen to me, my friend,

09:09.928 --> 09:11.504
here are some of the many reasons

09:11.510 --> 09:12.480
I'm not gonna let you in.

09:12.481 --> 09:15.734
One... you don't know who lives here,

09:15.767 --> 09:19.143
two... you're dressed like a serial killer,

09:19.171 --> 09:21.382
and three... you have
a serial killer nickname.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.463
My business is called

09:22.464 --> 09:23.898
the Hillside Electrical Strangler

09:23.942 --> 09:25.068
because I service these hills

09:25.074 --> 09:27.758
by locating people's electrical
problems and strangling them.

09:27.815 --> 09:28.778
You have to admit,

09:28.809 --> 09:30.348
it's a pretty weird thing
to name your business.

09:30.974 --> 09:33.132
The domain name cleared.

09:33.189 --> 09:34.836
Don't worry, Opus.

09:35.153 --> 09:37.906
We can ride out the storm in here. Uh-huh.

09:38.123 --> 09:40.458
All of our... water

09:40.470 --> 09:43.173
and toilet needs will be met.

09:44.630 --> 09:46.063
No.

09:46.357 --> 09:49.314
Don't panic just because I am.

09:49.434 --> 09:51.931
I need you to be strong now.

09:52.571 --> 09:55.039
You are my rock.

09:56.793 --> 09:59.451
I think you just dropped a few pebbles.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.564
- Tessa.
- Lisa! Thank God.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.592
Hey, I was just thinking about you

10:08.712 --> 10:11.808
and Ryan and the sweet love
the two of you could make.

10:11.831 --> 10:13.116
What?

10:13.133 --> 10:15.531
Look, Lisa, th... this isn't a good time.

10:15.651 --> 10:18.434
I am locked in a bathroom
with a baby in a thunderstorm.

10:18.472 --> 10:19.903
You know who would love that story?

10:20.023 --> 10:20.873
Ryan.

10:21.150 --> 10:22.295
What story?

10:22.564 --> 10:24.397
- Is it about a snake?
- Lisa!

10:24.672 --> 10:27.975
This isn't a joke. I'm freaking
out, and I really need help.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.591
And I can't call George, or he'll accuse me

10:30.616 --> 10:32.161
of being an ill-equipped only child.

10:32.186 --> 10:33.757
I wish I could help you, Tessa,

10:33.769 --> 10:36.104
but as you know, I'm terrified of babies.

10:36.691 --> 10:38.073
But you know who isn't?

10:38.599 --> 10:40.059
Who?

10:40.588 --> 10:43.922
This place has the best
bread basket in town,

10:43.954 --> 10:46.105
and if you bring something
home for your dog,

10:46.106 --> 10:47.608
they wrap it up like a little present,

10:47.935 --> 10:48.690
for your dog.

10:48.810 --> 10:51.111
Yeah. This jacket is a freaking nightmare.

10:51.487 --> 10:52.594
Muscle it.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.597
Don't be afraid and do not give up.

10:55.634 --> 10:56.893
Okay. Thank you.

10:56.927 --> 10:59.378
George, this is my life coach Tabitha.

10:59.889 --> 11:01.898
Hey. I'm unlicensed.

11:01.932 --> 11:04.050
Oh, okay. T... Tabitha.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.433
Uh, it's actually pronounced
"Tibet" and "itha."

11:06.470 --> 11:07.789
Tibetitha.

11:07.790 --> 11:08.798
Really? 

11:09.742 --> 11:12.845
It's a woman's name,
but, you know, I'm a guy.

11:12.876 --> 11:15.209
It's political yet whimsical,

11:15.234 --> 11:17.480
calls upon every one
of your preconceptions,

11:17.812 --> 11:19.615
and then spits in their faces.

11:20.609 --> 11:23.324
Okay. Well, uh, it's quite a coincidence.

11:23.368 --> 11:24.930
Not really. I invited him.

11:24.931 --> 11:26.251
Let me get this straight.

11:26.289 --> 11:27.959
You invited your life
coach to join us for dinner?

11:27.991 --> 11:30.037
Lucky for you, my evening was clear.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.314
So this is, like, uh, mostly fish?

11:35.255 --> 11:37.569
I... 

11:37.689 --> 11:40.465
I ran the whole way here.

11:40.585 --> 11:42.711
Ryan, I could kiss you.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.857
Tessa, this isn't about you.

11:45.382 --> 11:46.652
It's about me.

11:47.053 --> 11:49.974
Well, it started off about
you, but then it turned into me.

11:50.094 --> 11:53.808
I have a problem, and it's
bigger than your problem

11:53.809 --> 11:55.073
and it's scarier than your problem,

11:55.080 --> 11:57.389
and we aren't gonna solve
it... not here, not tonight.

11:58.173 --> 11:59.741
What's the problem?

12:00.626 --> 12:02.506
I think I'm dying.

12:11.434 --> 12:13.862
So the bird was frantic.

12:14.106 --> 12:16.070
Why? Because it was stuck.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.131
Why? Because my skylight
is very, very recessed.

12:20.251 --> 12:23.127
So it was banging its
beak against the glass

12:23.134 --> 12:23.947
like a total idiot.

12:24.067 --> 12:26.844
Why? Because in order to escape,

12:27.163 --> 12:29.097
the bird needed to fly down,

12:30.264 --> 12:32.015
but the bird didn't know that.

12:32.049 --> 12:33.902
George, are you mad at me?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.410
Shh. I'm waiting to hear
what happens to the bird.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.669
It's just... I wanted
this night to be perfect.

12:37.705 --> 12:40.006
I think we left "perfect"
four bird stories ago.

12:42.198 --> 12:44.538
So I got a ladder.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.633
I understand your impulse

12:46.634 --> 12:48.636
to want to have a side conversation,

12:48.830 --> 12:51.025
but I hardly think you
two are ready for that yet.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.771
Right. It's just that

12:52.820 --> 12:54.929
I usually wait until the
relationship is falling apart

12:54.948 --> 12:57.012
before I seek counseling.

12:57.025 --> 12:59.208
Do all your relationships
fall apart, George?

12:59.258 --> 13:01.642
Oh, I think he was joking, Tibetitha.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.575
- George, weren't you joking?
- I was joking.

13:03.695 --> 13:04.401
Correct.

13:04.432 --> 13:06.096
Well, I, uh, I guess your timing was off,

13:06.109 --> 13:09.763
because I didn't get the joke,
but very good instincts, Dallas.

13:09.883 --> 13:12.579
Thank you. So how about some bread?

13:12.754 --> 13:14.024
I would love some.

13:14.963 --> 13:17.621
That is a hell of a selection of bread.

13:17.741 --> 13:20.306
Look at all that. Huh?

13:21.126 --> 13:21.839
See what I'm doing?

13:21.883 --> 13:24.261
I do, yeah. You're handling
every single piece of bread.

13:24.292 --> 13:27.239
No, I'm exploring all my options.

13:27.277 --> 13:30.149
Look before you leap, George. Mm.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.658
So... no bread?

13:33.715 --> 13:36.608
Oh. There's the olive roll.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.714
See?

13:38.163 --> 13:39.646
If you dig deep enough,

13:39.681 --> 13:41.965
you can find exactly
what you're looking for.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.350
Ah.

13:43.601 --> 13:47.387
George, do you think Dallas
might be your olive roll?

13:47.418 --> 13:50.809
All I know for sure is I'm
not eating any of that bread.

13:50.821 --> 13:52.709
While George was plotting his escape,

13:52.744 --> 13:54.544
Noah was glued to his seat,

13:54.664 --> 13:57.172
because he was on a date
with the perfect woman.

13:57.209 --> 13:59.262
♪ si je t'aime, prends garde à toi ♪

13:59.382 --> 14:03.422
♪ Si tu ne m'aimes pas ♪

14:03.423 --> 14:06.971
♪ si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime ♪

14:07.001 --> 14:12.770
♪ mais si je t'aime, si je t'aime ♪

14:12.890 --> 14:16.574
♪ prends garde ♪

14:16.605 --> 14:19.627
♪ à toi ♪

14:24.802 --> 14:26.672
Bravo!

14:26.707 --> 14:28.941
Bravo!

14:28.976 --> 14:30.764
I would love to believe that I'm not dying,

14:30.777 --> 14:32.278
but I can't ignore the facts.

14:32.566 --> 14:35.713
One... Lisa's been acting really
super-duper nice all of a sudden,

14:35.766 --> 14:37.720
and two... I saw a movie once,

14:37.721 --> 14:39.630
where everyone was
super-duper nice to this guy,

14:39.667 --> 14:41.763
and then he coughed, and then he died.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.722
Sounds like one fact and a movie.

14:44.747 --> 14:46.787
Still, how do you explain the fact?

14:46.794 --> 14:48.182
Maybe it's a new disease.

14:48.302 --> 14:50.378
Maybe they'll call it Ryan's disease.

14:51.742 --> 14:55.026
How did I not realize
I was gonna die of that?

14:55.027 --> 14:55.665
Ryan...

14:55.671 --> 14:58.421
Maybe they'll write a song
about me called "Ryan's song."

14:59.494 --> 15:01.741
Maybe they can play it at my funeral.

15:03.022 --> 15:06.644
I feel like it should be
mostly instrumental, though.

15:06.682 --> 15:08.996
Maybe Lisa is just feeling nicer

15:08.997 --> 15:11.362
now that she's in a
relationship with Malik.

15:11.482 --> 15:13.345
People are nicer when they're happier.

15:14.115 --> 15:16.580
Maybe she just wants you to be happy, too.

15:16.630 --> 15:17.687
Look, I'm sorry.

15:17.807 --> 15:20.415
You have great ideas and you're
not afraid to express them.

15:20.535 --> 15:22.016
It's just... we're all gonna die,

15:23.409 --> 15:25.764
whether it's Ryan's
disease or Tessa's disease.

15:25.827 --> 15:26.965
Yeah. Sooner or later,

15:26.972 --> 15:28.260
the Hillside Electrical Strangler

15:28.261 --> 15:30.168
is gonna make a house call.

15:31.184 --> 15:32.551
So true.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.456
See, you and me and that
ugly baby over there...

15:37.739 --> 15:39.208
we're all gonna die.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.943
I don't think I really super-duper
realized that until tonight.

15:45.183 --> 15:49.135
I'm sorry to blow your
little baby mind. I'm sorry.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.805
Shh.

15:56.470 --> 16:00.774
Shh. Shut up.

16:02.894 --> 16:05.031
Shh... shut up. 

16:05.065 --> 16:06.399
Shut up.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.404
Nice work.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.406
Is it too late for that kiss?

16:22.740 --> 16:24.916
You forgot to... open your mouth

16:25.036 --> 16:27.554
and put your tongue on my tongue
and move it around and stuff.

16:27.588 --> 16:29.656
I didn't forget.

16:31.525 --> 16:34.165
You're not attracted to me
'cause I'm holding a baby?

16:35.029 --> 16:38.725
I'm only attracted to you
because you're holding a baby.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.049
So... that was...

16:50.025 --> 16:50.810
different.

16:51.251 --> 16:52.808
Oh, man. 

16:52.877 --> 16:55.167
I must've fallen asleep.

16:55.517 --> 16:58.596
Ah. George, thanks for the ride.

16:58.621 --> 17:00.454
Uh, if it hadn't started raining,

17:00.574 --> 17:02.150
I... I would've walked, I swear.

17:02.270 --> 17:03.871
I don't... believe you.

17:03.908 --> 17:05.910
Well, look, uh, final thoughts...

17:06.030 --> 17:08.537
uh, normally I wouldn't
weigh in on a relationship

17:08.561 --> 17:11.096
until I've met with a
couple a few more times,

17:11.115 --> 17:14.644
but, uh, in this case, it's safe to say

17:14.763 --> 17:16.752
that this relationship,

17:16.977 --> 17:18.710
in industry terms,

17:18.779 --> 17:22.308
is a total freaking cluster-snuff.

17:22.821 --> 17:25.662
I don't like to swear
in front of a patient.

17:25.723 --> 17:27.019
But I can e-mail you the translation

17:27.057 --> 17:27.907
if you give me your e-mail,

17:27.914 --> 17:29.622
which I would like to have anyway.

17:29.985 --> 17:32.249
Will get that from you.

17:37.073 --> 17:39.188
Okay, well, I'll, uh,

17:39.407 --> 17:40.833
I'll just find you on Facebook.

17:40.953 --> 17:43.141
Thanks for the ride, George.

17:43.185 --> 17:44.536
Bye-bye.

17:44.656 --> 17:46.470
Bye. Oh, puddle.

17:55.723 --> 17:57.624
I understand your apprehension,

17:57.625 --> 18:00.253
but a good domain name
can be hard to clear,

18:00.303 --> 18:01.229
and for the record,

18:01.448 --> 18:02.931
that guy strangled the
hell out of a problem

18:02.949 --> 18:04.482
we were having with our garage door.

18:04.602 --> 18:06.153
I'll call to reschedule.

18:06.948 --> 18:10.337
Thank you for a wonderful
evening, Mr. Wiener.

18:10.970 --> 18:12.559
It's my pleasure, angel.

18:12.679 --> 18:15.437
How do you say "angel" in Spanish?

18:15.631 --> 18:16.707
An-hel.

18:16.757 --> 18:18.115
Amazing.

18:18.647 --> 18:20.736
Such a rich culture.

18:21.719 --> 18:23.527
I'll go check on the baby.

18:23.752 --> 18:25.660
Encore! 

18:26.517 --> 18:28.420
That's one hell of an opera, that Carmen!

18:31.066 --> 18:33.474
Okay. What did I say? I said $100?

18:33.475 --> 18:36.228
Even though I probably would've
survived the night on my own,

18:36.348 --> 18:38.957
I was really glad that
when I called for help,

18:39.077 --> 18:40.445
someone was there to answer.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.129
Whoa! Hey. You're back.

18:44.130 --> 18:45.995
Lisa, I'm not as dumb as you think.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.235
I know something's up.

18:48.270 --> 18:50.807
At first I thought I might be dying,

18:51.426 --> 18:53.609
then I took a good, hard look
in the mirror and thought,

18:54.003 --> 18:56.693
come on. I'm not dying.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.766
Then I thought maybe you're dying.

19:01.172 --> 19:03.568
After all, you're pretty pale and sickly.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.688
But, Lisa, if someone's dying,
I don't want to know about it.

19:05.808 --> 19:06.833
Not tonight.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.663
Because I had the most perfect
evening with Tessa Altman.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.114
She kissed me. Tessa kissed me.

19:13.139 --> 19:15.102
She... she... she...
she didn't open her mouth

19:15.103 --> 19:16.812
or put her tongue on my tongue and, like,

19:17.125 --> 19:18.020
you know, move it around,

19:18.026 --> 19:19.708
but she kissed me, and it was incredible,

19:19.721 --> 19:21.460
and I owe it all to you, so...

19:22.654 --> 19:23.536
so thanks.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.876
That's what sisters are for.

19:24.895 --> 19:26.435
I know, dude.

19:27.859 --> 19:29.994
You're the best sister ever, bro.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.833
Well, that didn't work,

19:36.953 --> 19:38.328
but at least we tried.

19:38.390 --> 19:41.656
What? No, George Altman,
don't you dare say that.

19:43.258 --> 19:45.316
Hey. Hey! You're gonna ruin your coat.

19:45.329 --> 19:46.918
I don't care! I don't care about it,

19:47.124 --> 19:48.933
or the flowers or the restaurant.

19:48.946 --> 19:51.092
- Look, Dallas, that's sweet, but...
- No, you listen to me.

19:51.098 --> 19:54.865
I have dated men who are
worldlier and fancier,

19:54.985 --> 19:57.617
who have nicer cars and better clothes

19:57.624 --> 19:59.995
and were wealthier. Heck,
they were all wealthier.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.340
Thank you. Thank you for that.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.899
But every one of those men picked me.

20:03.905 --> 20:05.394
I thought that's how it was supposed to be.

20:05.419 --> 20:06.989
Men would ask me out, and I'd say yes,

20:07.027 --> 20:09.473
men would ask me to marry
them, and I'd say yes.

20:09.901 --> 20:12.445
And then along comes George Altman,

20:12.565 --> 20:14.304
and for the first time,

20:14.767 --> 20:17.145
I thought... there.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.834
I want that man.

20:19.028 --> 20:20.192
I pick him.

20:20.254 --> 20:22.050
I know I'm doing things different.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.390
It's because I feel so different.

20:24.510 --> 20:27.072
I can't believe my life coach
is right about us, George.

20:27.073 --> 20:28.081
I can't.

20:28.201 --> 20:29.138
There.

20:29.554 --> 20:30.933
You see that? 

20:31.053 --> 20:33.542
Your... your hair is a
mess, your makeup is running,

20:33.543 --> 20:34.956
but this...

20:34.975 --> 20:37.847
this is real, this is...

20:40.815 --> 20:42.664
this is the prettiest
you've looked all night.

20:44.367 --> 20:45.668
It is?

20:46.071 --> 20:47.820
Look...

20:48.246 --> 20:51.161
the only way we're ever gonna
find out if this can work

20:51.209 --> 20:53.632
- is if we get to be ourselves. Right?
- Right.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.016
And that means no coaches

20:57.779 --> 20:59.965
and no coaching from you.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.185
Okay?

21:03.448 --> 21:04.674
Okay.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.638
- George?
- Yeah?

21:11.650 --> 21:13.559
If you would've dropped the
umbrella when you kissed me,

21:13.571 --> 21:15.198
it would've been so much more romantic.

21:15.199 --> 21:16.737
You're very bossy.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.171
I can change.

21:19.809 --> 21:20.910
No, you can't.
