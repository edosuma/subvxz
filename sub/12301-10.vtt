WEBVTT

00:22.647 --> 00:24.842
Oops! Forget it.

00:24.842 --> 00:27.206
These rocks are sharp.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.499
Woo!

01:00.792 --> 01:02.671
What was that?

01:02.671 --> 01:03.907
What?

01:03.907 --> 01:06.406
Over there. That.

01:13.867 --> 01:15.399
Oh, my god.

01:28.690 --> 01:33.282
Everything she's wearing is designer.
After five, this season.

01:33.282 --> 01:37.253
She's wearing a high-end
movado watch, diamonds.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.293
Rules out robbery.

01:39.293 --> 01:42.380
It's not exactly a diamond watch
type of neighborhood though, is it?

01:42.380 --> 01:43.994
Well, she didn't get here willingly.

01:43.994 --> 01:46.426
Look at the ligature marks.

01:46.896 --> 01:50.015
The way her makeup's smeared,
I think she's been crying.

01:50.015 --> 01:51.393
Did you get an id, Alexx?

01:51.393 --> 01:55.484
No id, no purse, nothing.

01:56.045 --> 01:58.627
Movado watches are registered.
We find out who bought it,

01:58.627 --> 02:01.008
- we might find out who she is.
- I'll check it out.

02:01.008 --> 02:03.445
How'd you get here, honey?

02:03.795 --> 02:06.343
Couple found her at 0500.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.669
Said she fell from the sky.

02:12.820 --> 02:14.568
Gets better.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.956
She's in rigor.

02:15.956 --> 02:18.521
She's in rigor in an hour?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.897
Fully formed.

02:23.545 --> 02:26.090
So, she was dead before
she hit the ground.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.556
Body dump.

02:27.556 --> 02:31.788
So priority number one is for us

02:31.788 --> 02:33.649
to find the murder scene.

03:08.528 --> 03:12.697
MIAMI
2x10 Extreme

03:27.847 --> 03:29.784
I thought we called for the whole crew.

03:29.784 --> 03:32.729
Calleigh's in the parking
structure and Eric is, uh,

03:32.729 --> 03:36.591
Eric is where?

03:36.768 --> 03:38.148
I've paged him five times.

03:38.148 --> 03:39.537
No answer.

03:39.537 --> 03:41.204
I'll keep trying him.

03:41.332 --> 03:43.352
Okay, let dispatch handle it.
You ready?

03:46.694 --> 03:49.414
Nails are broken and worn down.

03:52.478 --> 03:54.398
She's got dust all over her body.

03:54.398 --> 03:56.043
You got an extra lifter?

03:56.043 --> 03:58.045
Yeah, Take all the trace you want.

03:58.045 --> 04:00.264
She's covered with it.

04:01.857 --> 04:04.371
It's even on her eyelashes.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.332
It's on her eyelashes, and
you know what that means.

04:10.332 --> 04:13.248
She was in a confined space.

04:15.074 --> 04:17.103
I'll post her first.

04:17.238 --> 04:19.572
Let's get the gurney in here.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.937
These boots were new.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.868
Taking a break?

04:50.868 --> 04:53.108
Yeah, just hanging out.

04:53.303 --> 04:54.791
Did you talk to Eric?

04:54.791 --> 04:57.286
No, nothing.

04:57.443 --> 04:58.878
He's really screwing up.

04:58.878 --> 05:01.506
Must have a new lady friend.

05:01.895 --> 05:03.431
Level three, huh?

05:03.431 --> 05:06.245
so we're thinking he dumped
her over that rail.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.408
Any luck?

05:08.408 --> 05:09.849
Not really.

05:09.849 --> 05:12.967
There's no gated entry, so I figure
the guy just drove in, got out,

05:12.967 --> 05:15.124
dumped her and left.

05:15.124 --> 05:17.595
What about these sealant marks?

05:18.052 --> 05:20.621
Well, it's too much to even bother.

05:20.621 --> 05:24.213
I mean, the old ones look
the same as the fresh ones.

05:24.213 --> 05:27.167
Stuff's soft though.
I got some on my boot.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.851
That's one way to collect evidence.

05:28.851 --> 05:30.426
I'll take it.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.898
Well, there's not much up here.

05:34.016 --> 05:36.654
Well, you know what the textbooks say,

05:36.654 --> 05:39.343
if you can't place the suspect
at the crime scene...

05:39.343 --> 05:42.119
you place the crime scene
on the suspect.

05:48.149 --> 05:50.356
So far no luck on any id.

05:50.356 --> 05:53.539
Her prints aren't in any database
and no one matching her description

05:53.539 --> 05:56.937
- has been reported missing.
- Okay, Alexx, what can you tell me?

05:56.937 --> 05:59.846
Cause of death is asphyxiation
due to suffocation.

05:59.846 --> 06:01.514
From being in a confined space?

06:01.514 --> 06:04.863
Considered that until I washed her.

06:06.058 --> 06:08.825
She's got bruising
on both sides of her face.

06:08.825 --> 06:10.992
From smothering.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.961
Her frenulum is torn.

06:19.245 --> 06:22.113
- Classic signs.
- Do we know what was used?

06:22.113 --> 06:24.140
Maybe.

06:24.362 --> 06:27.882
Found some plastic material
on her shoulder.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.526
Okay.

06:32.729 --> 06:37.159
Bound, kept in a confined space.
This sounds like kidnapping, Alexx.

06:37.159 --> 06:41.019
Seems odd to kidnap someone,
then dump the body in a public place.

06:41.019 --> 06:44.595
Well, we are applying reason to
an unreasonable act, aren't we?

06:44.595 --> 06:47.650
Unreasonable acts are all I see.

06:47.797 --> 06:50.267
Amen to that.

07:09.074 --> 07:10.965
Eric...

07:13.812 --> 07:16.371
I bet the other guy looks worse.

07:17.615 --> 07:20.726
Was at the right place, wrong time.

07:20.726 --> 07:22.546
You okay?

07:22.780 --> 07:24.292
Yeah, I'm all right.

07:24.432 --> 07:25.943
I took a beating,

07:25.943 --> 07:28.250
but I think I found a chop shop.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.464
- Okay, chop shop.
- I think so.

07:30.464 --> 07:32.444
I've got to run some vin
numbers and make sure.

07:32.444 --> 07:35.363
Well, that explains why you weren't
at the callout for the body dump.

07:35.363 --> 07:37.774
Yeah, sorry.

07:37.876 --> 07:40.781
What did Speedle and
Calleigh have to say?

07:40.781 --> 07:43.255
I think they're just
concerned about you.

07:44.886 --> 07:48.604
Look, is it all right if I run
with this chop-shop thing?

07:48.604 --> 07:51.139
I would check with auto theft first.

07:51.268 --> 07:52.657
All right.

07:58.371 --> 07:59.927
Thank you.

08:00.718 --> 08:02.243
Horatio. / Yeah?

08:02.243 --> 08:04.915
Well, I found who bought
the victim's watch. / Okay,

08:04.915 --> 08:07.386
let me guess. They don't live
anywhere near coral reef do they?

08:07.386 --> 08:08.320
That's right.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.253
Came back to a Thomas chandler,
north coconut lane, hibiscus island.

08:12.253 --> 08:14.813
We just tracked him to coconut beach.

08:31.473 --> 08:34.457
Wow, which one bought the watch?

08:34.457 --> 08:36.655
Tommy.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.732
- Meet lieutenant Caine.
- Yeah, right lady.

08:39.732 --> 08:42.539
He's a cop like you're a cop?

08:42.768 --> 08:46.591
Let me guess, does
he play the mean one?

08:46.591 --> 08:48.713
You're the one who bought
the movado watch, son?

08:48.713 --> 08:52.149
Yeah, like I told her, I gave it
to my girlfriend as a birthday present.

08:52.149 --> 08:53.630
Girlfriend got a name?

08:53.630 --> 08:57.198
- Nikki wilcox.
- Wilcox conglomerate, right?

08:57.198 --> 08:58.516
Yeah, that's right.

08:58.516 --> 09:00.549
Is everything okay here, Tommy?

09:00.549 --> 09:02.853
Yeah, just give us a minute, will you?

09:02.853 --> 09:04.659
Yeah, sure.

09:05.718 --> 09:08.191
That's my buddy Keith.
He likes rock climbing.

09:08.295 --> 09:11.945
Me, I like to keep
my thrills on terra firma.

09:11.988 --> 09:13.520
Afraid of heights.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.931
Interesting. When was
the last time you saw Nikki?

09:16.931 --> 09:19.857
All right guys, look,
I really do appreciate this, but

09:19.857 --> 09:23.036
can we jump to the
next stage please?

09:23.036 --> 09:26.129
Next stage? / Yeah, come on,
this isn't funny.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.024
I would agree.

09:29.024 --> 09:30.316
Whoa,

09:30.316 --> 09:32.907
nice work, especially the makeup.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.804
- I'm sorry?
- The injuries, they look real.

09:37.337 --> 09:40.105
They are real. / Alright,
look, enough fooling around

09:40.105 --> 09:46.176
Okay? Just tell me Nikki's location
and I'll go rescue her, okay?

09:47.051 --> 09:49.248
You want to go see Nikki?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.634
Yeah, I do.

09:57.981 --> 10:00.633
Oh my god, Nikki.

10:03.977 --> 10:05.623
You need anything else, Horatio?

10:05.623 --> 10:08.428
No, Alexx, I think that'll be all.

10:08.634 --> 10:10.840
Then I'll give you two a minute.

10:16.976 --> 10:19.814
This wasn't supposed to happen.

10:20.509 --> 10:23.047
It's not part of the game.

10:23.047 --> 10:25.844
It's no longer a game, is it, Tommy?

10:37.945 --> 10:42.420
Nikki heard this extreme
kidnapping thing was...

10:42.420 --> 10:45.666
- the ultimate high.
- How did she find out about it?

10:45.816 --> 10:49.040
Uh... some dude in rehab.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.441
Said to pay this company 20 grand,
and they'll arrange the whole thing.

10:52.441 --> 10:54.390
Do you remember
the name of the company?

10:54.677 --> 10:56.642
Gotcha.

10:56.642 --> 10:58.511
Wouldn't tell us where or
when they'd grab her.

10:58.511 --> 11:00.077
Adds to the thrill, I guess.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.617
When did they grab her?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.490
We were coming out of fate.

11:03.490 --> 11:06.048
Closing the place down.

11:06.285 --> 11:07.966
I was still rolling.

11:07.966 --> 11:09.775
She... she hadn't slept in days.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.575
Hey!

11:21.396 --> 11:22.958
Tommy!

11:29.247 --> 11:32.447
your girlfriend was so bored, she
needed to get kidnapped to get excited?

11:32.447 --> 11:34.842
Nikki liked to push everything

11:34.842 --> 11:37.540
and everybody to the limit.

11:38.014 --> 11:39.876
We both did.

11:40.364 --> 11:43.802
Well, it sounds like
somebody pushed back.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.463
I'm truly sorry to hear about Ms. Wilcox,

11:48.463 --> 11:52.532
and I can assure you,
I was not involved.

11:52.989 --> 11:54.375
Well...

11:54.375 --> 11:56.385
you did kidnap her.

11:56.385 --> 11:58.754
At her request.

11:58.754 --> 12:02.622
Gotcha is for people who've
tried it all and gotten bored.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.098
- I'm just like any other...
- drug dealer?

12:05.098 --> 12:06.536
Service provider.

12:06.536 --> 12:08.456
Except what I do is perfectly legal,

12:08.456 --> 12:10.934
and adrenaline is the
purest rush there is.

12:10.934 --> 12:12.552
That's what I give people.

12:12.552 --> 12:14.971
You gave Nikki wilcox a toe tag.

12:14.971 --> 12:17.590
She was in the hands
of two of my best guys.

12:17.590 --> 12:19.481
Where are they?

12:21.243 --> 12:22.591
I don't know.

12:22.591 --> 12:24.418
They're independent contractors.

12:24.418 --> 12:27.404
All I demand is that they report
to me after every stage.

12:27.404 --> 12:29.469
When did you lose contact with them?

12:29.469 --> 12:31.759
- Right after the ransom stage.
- Ransom?

12:31.759 --> 12:33.912
We get half our fee up front

12:33.912 --> 12:36.307
and the second half as a ransom,

12:36.307 --> 12:38.645
preferably in non-sequential hundreds.

12:38.645 --> 12:41.117
We find that it adds realism to the rescue.

12:41.117 --> 12:43.187
So, who was supposed to rescue her?

12:43.187 --> 12:44.945
Her boyfriend, Tommy.

12:44.945 --> 12:46.698
The kidnapping was his gift to her.

12:46.698 --> 12:49.571
- How thoughtful.
- Trust me, it was.

12:49.571 --> 12:51.725
Ever have make-up sex?

12:51.725 --> 12:54.887
Multiply that by a hundred
and you have rescue sex.

12:54.887 --> 12:57.308
Except she was crying
and fought for her life.

12:57.308 --> 12:59.465
She knew exactly what
she was getting into.

12:59.465 --> 13:00.892
She signed a release.

13:00.892 --> 13:04.214
We can get that over to questioned
documents, check it for forgery.

13:04.214 --> 13:07.934
Look, if you don't believe me, believe her.

13:08.656 --> 13:12.607
I, the fabulous Nikki wilcox...

13:12.607 --> 13:14.759
understand that my safety and health,

13:14.759 --> 13:17.919
both mental and physical,
cannot be assured.

13:17.919 --> 13:19.419
This is so phat.

13:19.419 --> 13:21.085
I know, baby.

13:25.716 --> 13:31.428
And that kidnapping is inherently
dangerous and morally reprehensible.

13:32.646 --> 13:36.487
As you see, that clears
us of all liability.

13:36.487 --> 13:38.713
Maybe for kidnapping.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.665
But not for murder.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.856
Horatio.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.325
Yes, sir.

13:46.475 --> 13:50.565
Your CSI, Delko, put the
screws to me, but good.

13:50.565 --> 13:51.946
What are you talking about, Frank?

13:51.946 --> 13:53.714
I thought he told you
about the ass-kicking.

13:53.714 --> 13:55.260
He did tell me about it, why?

13:55.260 --> 13:57.612
Then you didn't get
the whole story, did you?

13:58.679 --> 14:00.692
I guess I didn't.

14:00.822 --> 14:01.656
Come on.

14:01.656 --> 14:03.633
Let's find Eric.

14:09.147 --> 14:12.929
F for penmanship, Delko.
This a z or a two?

14:13.005 --> 14:15.436
Look smart ass, I wasn't
sitting behind a desk

14:15.436 --> 14:18.694
in a nice comfortable chair
when I wrote this down, okay?

14:18.694 --> 14:23.067
Got V22Z.

14:28.045 --> 14:31.106
All right, there are your vehicles.

14:31.106 --> 14:32.787
All stolen.

14:32.787 --> 14:35.378
My hunch was right.
This is a chop shop.

14:35.881 --> 14:37.481
SW?

14:37.481 --> 14:38.987
Why would there be
a search warrant?

14:38.987 --> 14:40.793
Auto theft told me they weren't
investigating the place.

14:40.793 --> 14:43.327
Someone was.

14:45.130 --> 14:51.472
A search warrant was issued to...
1137 cypress drive.

14:51.676 --> 14:54.951
Do me a favor. Scroll down
and see who the affiant is.

14:57.607 --> 15:00.419
Damn it. / Frank tripp.

15:00.586 --> 15:04.773
What's the big deal? Detective Tripp
will probably thank you for helping him.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.994
Wanna bet?

15:08.625 --> 15:10.144
You first, Frank.

15:10.144 --> 15:12.061
I was going to bust this place. All right?

15:12.061 --> 15:14.553
Hold the chop shop over
Hector jones's head.

15:14.553 --> 15:17.705
Get him to flip on his partner
behind a homicide down in olcola.

15:17.705 --> 15:20.251
Now that you've conducted this
illegal search, I got nothing.

15:20.251 --> 15:23.506
It wasn't my intention to step
on your case, all right, Frank?

15:23.506 --> 15:26.401
I observed what I thought to be
criminal activity and I gathered intel.

15:26.401 --> 15:28.308
- You gathered intel?
- Yeah, gathered intel, Frank.

15:28.308 --> 15:29.839
What are you,
crime-fighting boy now?

15:29.839 --> 15:31.578
What were you doing
there in the first place?

15:31.578 --> 15:33.159
Frank.

15:33.755 --> 15:35.243
Eric, tell me what happened.

15:35.243 --> 15:37.159
Nothing, I was at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

15:37.159 --> 15:38.598
It won't happen again. / Okay,

15:38.598 --> 15:42.586
for arguments sake, let's say
we can't get Hector on the chop shop.

15:42.586 --> 15:45.102
- What about assaulting an officer?
- Yeah, I'll testify to that.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.075
We're going to need more than your word.
We're going to need some evidence.

15:47.075 --> 15:48.994
These cuts and bruises
don't count for anything?

15:48.994 --> 15:51.351
Only if we can prove
Hector did them alone.

15:51.351 --> 15:56.080
Come on, guys, don't you have some sort of fancy
gizmo you can prove Hector made those bruises?

15:56.080 --> 15:59.521
Maybe one of your blue lights
or your mass spectro thingies

15:59.521 --> 16:01.853
with all the bells and whistles
on them and all that crap?

16:01.853 --> 16:04.004
In this case, we don't,
so I'm sorry.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.457
So, this guy walks? / For now, Frank,
until we can get something on Hector.

16:07.457 --> 16:08.506
All right?

16:10.740 --> 16:12.301
All right.

16:16.480 --> 16:21.113
That green plastic sheeting Alexx
found wasn't from a trash bag.

16:21.213 --> 16:22.708
Are you sure about this?

16:24.879 --> 16:26.172
Traces of RDX?

16:26.172 --> 16:28.736
Mixed with petroleum and
a glycerin plasticizer.

16:28.736 --> 16:30.507
C-4 explosives.

16:30.507 --> 16:32.495
Wrapper was O.D. Green.

16:32.495 --> 16:34.701
Standard military issue.

16:34.819 --> 16:39.365
Yep, only problem is no active
military bases in south florida.

16:39.439 --> 16:42.498
We got an air national guard
unit at naranja.

16:43.609 --> 16:46.353
That's less than a mile away
from where they found the body.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.210
A 3,000 acre ghost town.

16:49.210 --> 16:51.466
It's a perfect place to hide.

17:13.374 --> 17:16.577
After Andrew, we used these
to hold the base's munitions.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.255
Now they're all slated
to be torn down.

17:19.255 --> 17:23.335
This far away from the action,
nobody uses them anymore.

17:26.228 --> 17:28.468
Well, somebody did.

17:46.169 --> 17:48.173
What's this, Speed?

17:48.513 --> 17:50.790
It's composition four.

17:55.069 --> 17:58.374
- Explains the wrapper.
- Yeah, open it.

18:01.837 --> 18:04.353
and the trace on her body.

18:11.828 --> 18:14.355
Take a look at this.

18:20.194 --> 18:23.477
She was trying to claw her way out.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.578
Yeah, I got a few hairs here, too.

18:26.578 --> 18:28.856
Bloody fingernail.

18:32.199 --> 18:34.408
Is that a tooth?

18:36.282 --> 18:39.236
(?)Tooth might have DNA.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.224
Our victim didn't have a broken tooth.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.660
She must have fought back.

18:50.969 --> 18:53.218
Hey.

18:53.218 --> 18:55.025
You were right about the tooth.

18:55.025 --> 18:58.580
- It didn't match our victim.
- Okay, so why are you smiling?

18:58.580 --> 19:01.960
Because it does match Manny ocola.

19:01.960 --> 19:06.004
Codis hit? / He got popped
for a B & E back in '97.

19:06.004 --> 19:08.598
Patrols are bringing him in now.

19:08.798 --> 19:11.004
Hey, when I left her,
she was alive, right?

19:11.004 --> 19:14.411
And still kicking. Right, manny?

19:14.507 --> 19:16.737
Isn't that how you
snapped off your tooth?

19:16.737 --> 19:19.449
Things got out of control, didn't they?

19:23.700 --> 19:25.479
You know what?
It's what she was paying for, man.

19:25.479 --> 19:27.175
A lot of these people,
they try to escape.

19:27.175 --> 19:30.519
It's all part of the game, and my job's
just to fight them off a little bit.

19:30.519 --> 19:33.676
- Restrain them, you know?
- When was the last time you saw her?

19:33.676 --> 19:35.796
It was before we went
to collect the ransom.

19:35.796 --> 19:38.016
But you never went back
to check on her, did you?

19:38.016 --> 19:39.927
Hey, that's not my job.
That's Jack's job.

19:39.927 --> 19:41.580
Jack being your partner.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.538
He kind of ran things for gotcha.

19:43.538 --> 19:45.769
I'm just there to, you know,
help scare them a little bit.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.979
Ms. Weber says I have this
early keitel look, you know?

19:50.306 --> 19:52.369
Did Jack ever go too far?

19:52.369 --> 19:54.058
Every kidnap victim has a safe word.

19:54.058 --> 19:55.947
They say it, we're done. It's simple.

19:55.947 --> 19:58.084
And Nikki wilcox never
used hers, did she?

19:58.084 --> 19:59.814
Rich people are
a little weird, you know.

19:59.814 --> 20:01.461
Baby-sitting spoiled kids...

20:01.461 --> 20:03.653
it beats boosting TVs
any day of the week.

20:03.653 --> 20:07.110
Beautiful young heiress
like Nikki wilcox?

20:07.110 --> 20:09.602
- Not your average client.
- You kidding?

20:09.602 --> 20:12.854
Most of the time my victim is
some pasty dude in a diaper.

20:12.854 --> 20:15.374
She just made things a little difficult
to stay professional, you know?

20:15.374 --> 20:17.528
For your partner, too,
Right, Manny?

20:17.528 --> 20:20.658
Jack got me this job, all right?
So I'm not going to speak out of school.

20:20.658 --> 20:22.124
Fair enough, Manny.

20:22.124 --> 20:24.075
Fair enough. What I do
want to know, is

20:24.075 --> 20:27.976
who was supposed to contact
Nikki's boyfriend to set up the rescue?

20:27.976 --> 20:30.585
You guys are going to have to talk
to Jack about that, partner.

20:30.585 --> 20:33.392
Manny, you can bet the ranch on it.

20:47.421 --> 20:50.357
All right, so both of those
fingernails that we found

20:50.357 --> 20:53.885
are liquid monomer and
they've got traces of EMA.

20:54.057 --> 20:57.912
That's acrylic nails. / Yeah, but
wthat's here the similarities end.

20:58.765 --> 21:01.675
They both have different applications.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.285
One's pink and white and
one's a polished french tip.

21:04.285 --> 21:06.872
These are different processes,
they don't match.

21:06.872 --> 21:09.207
All right, I should have known that.

21:09.284 --> 21:12.024
Well, I would be scared if you did.

21:12.024 --> 21:15.389
You know, I'm thinking maybe her
kidnappers have used this box before.

21:15.389 --> 21:17.769
Looks like another lady tried
to get out of there.

21:17.769 --> 21:20.442
Or maybe tried to keep our victim in.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.528
Excuse me.

21:24.626 --> 21:25.917
Thanks.

21:26.153 --> 21:27.356
Hey. / Hey.

21:27.356 --> 21:30.164
Yelina, did you find anything else
about Nikki wilcox?

21:30.164 --> 21:31.722
Victim was a party girl.

21:31.722 --> 21:34.132
Her old man's a
self-made gazillionaire.

21:34.132 --> 21:35.176
She lived at home.

21:35.176 --> 21:37.126
Well, whenever she made it there.

21:37.126 --> 21:39.279
Then only stayed to give
her dad some face time.

21:39.279 --> 21:40.909
Did you talk to her old man?

21:40.909 --> 21:43.160
I'm on my way there now.

21:50.201 --> 21:53.308
When was the last time you saw
your daughter, Mr. Wilcox?

21:53.378 --> 21:55.083
We, um...

21:55.163 --> 21:57.192
mostly spoke on the phone.

21:57.618 --> 21:59.684
The missus saw her last.

21:59.684 --> 22:01.271
Celine.

22:04.553 --> 22:07.753
Nikki stopped by for some clothes
about three nights ago.

22:07.753 --> 22:10.234
Had that boy Tommy with her.

22:10.234 --> 22:12.778
I take it he wasn't your favorite.

22:13.138 --> 22:15.474
Some people got no class.

22:15.474 --> 22:17.340
Tattoos,

22:17.340 --> 22:19.066
greasy hair,

22:19.066 --> 22:20.976
walked around with a, uh,

22:20.976 --> 22:22.949
fish hook in his lip.

22:22.949 --> 22:25.060
It was a lip ring, dear.

22:25.142 --> 22:28.303
In my time, it meant something,
which wasn't very good.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.899
Look, lieutenant.

22:29.899 --> 22:31.778
I will do anything

22:31.778 --> 22:34.753
to help you find the bastard
that did this to my daughter.

22:34.753 --> 22:38.221
All right, does that include
showing us financial records?

22:38.306 --> 22:40.115
I'll clear it with my lawyers.

22:40.115 --> 22:42.576
How about you, Mrs. Wilcox?

22:43.231 --> 22:46.682
She will do anything you need.

22:46.758 --> 22:51.240
Nicole was wild, lieutenant,
but she was a good kid.

22:51.457 --> 22:55.092
We all do things that we regret at 21.

22:55.092 --> 23:01.684
Yes, well, regret is one thing,
losing your life is another.

23:12.902 --> 23:14.398
Hey, prize fighter.

23:14.398 --> 23:15.551
Hey.

23:15.551 --> 23:17.748
More like prize punching bag.

23:18.028 --> 23:20.625
That's your shirt.
Did you forget you lint brush?

23:20.625 --> 23:23.596
No, just looking for evidence.

23:23.992 --> 23:25.752
Okay, so, let me get this straight.

23:25.752 --> 23:29.269
You were walking by,
you found a chop shop,

23:29.269 --> 23:31.706
you stopped and got into a fight.

23:31.813 --> 23:33.990
Not exactly.

23:38.565 --> 23:40.997
How old is she?

23:41.904 --> 23:43.928
It's not like that.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.232
Seriously.

23:52.071 --> 23:53.915
Is that yours?

24:01.282 --> 24:04.049
Nope. It's the bad guy's.

24:04.049 --> 24:05.331
It's all dried out.

24:05.331 --> 24:07.918
If you check the prescription,
you might get something off it.

24:07.918 --> 24:10.141
Actually, I think I have another idea.

24:10.141 --> 24:14.449
Okay, well, I'm going to be doing some
business in the AV lab if you need me.

24:14.449 --> 24:16.231
Okay.

24:19.505 --> 24:22.501
What'd you learn about the lifestyles
of the rich and spoiled?

24:22.501 --> 24:24.437
That not all of them are rich.

24:24.437 --> 24:25.982
What do you mean, string bean?

24:25.982 --> 24:27.749
That watch we pulled off the victim,

24:27.749 --> 24:30.575
the one the boyfriend
claimed he bought her?

24:30.738 --> 24:33.949
Yeah? / Well, Nikki paid for it herself.

24:33.949 --> 24:37.614
Well, if you can't afford a watch, how
can you dig up $20,000 for a kidnapping?

24:37.614 --> 24:39.904
Maybe he asked the stepmom.

24:44.330 --> 24:47.965
Oh, daddy warbucks had his wife
on a pretty short leash.

24:47.965 --> 24:50.603
Unlimited credit card use,
but no bank account.

24:50.603 --> 24:51.684
She didn't need it.

24:51.684 --> 24:53.450
Take a look at what
she bought last tuesday.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.153
All right.

24:56.594 --> 25:00.054
Oh, Luis feraud russian
sable coat, 20 grand.

25:00.054 --> 25:02.032
Who needs a sable coat in florida?

25:02.032 --> 25:03.728
Not her.

25:08.728 --> 25:12.104
Surveillance tape from the day
after she bought the coat.

25:17.718 --> 25:19.693
She returned it for cash.

25:19.693 --> 25:24.248
Not just cash.
Nonsequential $100 bills.

25:33.025 --> 25:36.017
So, I returned a few things.

25:36.017 --> 25:37.553
It's no big deal.

25:37.553 --> 25:41.234
It is a big deal if you used the money
to kidnap his daughter and have her killed.

25:41.234 --> 25:43.304
That is a big deal.

25:43.304 --> 25:46.411
I might not have liked Nikki,

25:46.436 --> 25:48.037
but she was Hal's baby.

25:48.137 --> 25:51.231
And the only thing between
you and his fortune.

25:51.231 --> 25:53.103
I don't want Hal's money.

25:53.103 --> 25:57.941
You want some of it, otherwise you
wouldn't return everything for cash.

25:58.204 --> 26:03.653
I've spent ten years putting the stink
of tucworth, alabama behind me,

26:03.653 --> 26:06.707
but I still love my family.

26:06.707 --> 26:08.231
I'm, uh,

26:08.231 --> 26:11.350
I'm sorry, I don't,
I don't get the connection.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.989
That's where the money goes.

26:14.464 --> 26:16.674
My husband supports me, and

26:16.674 --> 26:18.446
I support them.

26:25.408 --> 26:28.556
Hey. / I just checked
the wilcox financial records.

26:28.556 --> 26:32.021
Okay, how much does Celine wilcox stand
to make with the daughter out of the way?

26:32.021 --> 26:34.280
Well, that's it. it doesn't
change anything.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.447
She's got a pre-nup?

26:35.447 --> 26:36.435
Airtight.

26:36.435 --> 26:39.727
In fact, she actually makes more money
the longer the old guy stays alive.

26:39.727 --> 26:41.553
Pre-nup with an escalator clause.

26:41.553 --> 26:44.660
Exactly. If he dies today,
she gets nothing.

26:44.660 --> 26:47.128
She gets an extra million dollars
for every two years they stay together.

26:47.128 --> 26:49.878
So, you're saying she married for love.

26:49.878 --> 26:52.237
- Wonders never cease.
- And we're back to square one.

26:52.237 --> 26:56.457
Well, not quite. A patrol car did pick up
our lead kidnapper, a Jack hawkins.

26:56.457 --> 26:58.804
P.D.'s got him, and
Speed's already down there.

26:58.804 --> 27:02.469
What, trying to get with a pretty girl,
now that's a crime?

27:02.469 --> 27:05.118
No, but killing somebody is.

27:05.118 --> 27:06.845
I didn't kill anybody.

27:06.845 --> 27:09.921
You came back after
collecting the ransom...

27:18.780 --> 27:21.657
but you didn't call her
boyfriend right away.

27:21.657 --> 27:23.480
You were hoping you were
going to try your luck.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.004
A little stockholm syndrome action.

27:26.004 --> 27:28.246
Hey, what you gonna do waiting for?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.588
And then you tried to keep her quiet,

27:29.588 --> 27:31.596
but you didn't realize
you were suffocating her.

27:32.645 --> 27:35.779
Somebody knew we were there.
That's who killed her.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.990
Okay, so, what you're saying
is you went to get the ransom money,

27:38.990 --> 27:41.550
and that's the last time
you saw Nikki alive.

27:41.550 --> 27:43.265
Swear on my mother.

27:43.265 --> 27:45.224
I'm glad I'm not her.

27:46.095 --> 27:48.565
Show us your shoes.

27:49.551 --> 27:51.982
The bottoms.

27:56.149 --> 28:01.869
Okay, that is the epoxy resin from the
parking structure where Nikki was tossed.

28:14.337 --> 28:15.640
Okay,

28:15.849 --> 28:19.245
Now, if I dumped a body
after its already dead,

28:19.245 --> 28:21.085
there's no crime there, right?

28:21.085 --> 28:22.221
Go on.

28:22.221 --> 28:26.126
I got back to the base,
and she wasn't in the box.

28:38.394 --> 28:41.000
So I threw her in the van.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.910
I knew my boss and
the girl's rich-ass dad,

28:43.910 --> 28:45.598
they'd come looking for me.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.221
Now, I panicked.

28:47.221 --> 28:50.019
How did the killer get
inside the warehouse?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.835
I don't know.

28:51.835 --> 28:54.198
It's a double-bolt lock.

28:54.198 --> 28:56.393
I have the only key.

28:56.745 --> 28:58.461
Sit tight.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.720
Do you think he's our guy?

29:04.720 --> 29:06.435
No, I don't. / Why not?

29:06.435 --> 29:08.737
Because there was
no sign of sexual assault,

29:08.737 --> 29:12.816
he got his ransom money
and the game was over for him.

29:12.816 --> 29:14.634
Basically, he had
no reason to kill her.

29:14.634 --> 29:16.640
And every reason to let her go.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.754
So what happened?

29:17.754 --> 29:23.041
Somewhere, somebody changed
the rules of the game.

29:34.748 --> 29:38.234
We changed the locks and beefed up
security since you were here last.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.236
I'll be outside if you need anything.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.750
Thank you, sergeant.

29:42.413 --> 29:46.164
Jack mentioned that he bolt-locked
the door before he left for the ransom.

29:50.883 --> 29:52.446
The window.

29:52.554 --> 29:54.638
Maybe that's our point of entry.

29:54.638 --> 29:56.137
Let's check it.

29:57.610 --> 29:59.049
There's been a recent disturbance.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.585
The dust is wiped away
from the bottom edge.

30:01.689 --> 30:03.822
Can you open the window?

30:05.891 --> 30:06.994
Oh, yeah.

30:06.994 --> 30:09.369
He definitely came in through here.

30:09.449 --> 30:11.462
I'm going to check for prints.

30:14.839 --> 30:16.620
What did you get, Speed?

30:16.804 --> 30:20.963
Not much. Gravel's a lousy
surface for shoe prints.

30:22.118 --> 30:24.147
Yes, it can be.

30:41.739 --> 30:44.277
There are no prints
on the inside window.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.358
What have you got?

30:46.547 --> 30:52.231
I've got a blueish powdery substance
right here and above the frame.

30:52.231 --> 30:55.031
I'll come down and check it out.

31:23.135 --> 31:24.856
Did you get something, Speed?

31:24.989 --> 31:26.724
Yeah.

31:27.671 --> 31:29.970
Take a look at this.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.779
Lipstick.

31:32.859 --> 31:34.957
Looks like we found
our murder weapon.

31:45.205 --> 31:48.436
She looked him right in the eyes
when he was killing her.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.963
And he looked back.

31:55.139 --> 31:57.824
So, I'll hand-carry this plastic
wrap over to DNA.

31:57.824 --> 32:00.987
Valera will swab it for epithelials,
and then I'll check it for prints.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.416
Great. I'll work on the blue powder.

32:02.416 --> 32:03.699
All right.

32:04.818 --> 32:06.773
Looks like it's just you and me, Sam.

32:06.773 --> 32:08.306
Always a pleasure.

32:21.399 --> 32:24.154
Appears to be some kind of chalk.

32:24.154 --> 32:27.847
We found small amounts of it on the side
of the building of our kidnapping site.

32:27.847 --> 32:29.456
Well...

32:29.735 --> 32:32.833
Let's see what the I.R. has to say.

32:43.366 --> 32:45.922
Magnesium carbonate and...

32:45.922 --> 32:47.950
silicate.

32:48.258 --> 32:51.113
Chalk and some sort of a drying agent.

32:51.113 --> 32:54.042
Yeah, these compounds are
usually combined for athletes,

32:54.042 --> 32:56.009
to keep their hands dry.

32:56.368 --> 32:58.197
Like rock climbers?

32:59.032 --> 33:00.554
I was there, okay?

33:00.554 --> 33:01.917
You were?

33:01.917 --> 33:03.726
I even paid for it.

33:03.826 --> 33:05.612
You paid for the kidnapping?

33:05.612 --> 33:07.349
It's not like Tommy had any money.

33:07.349 --> 33:08.606
So, we're learning.

33:08.606 --> 33:11.096
Why would you pay
for the kidnapping, Keith?

33:11.203 --> 33:13.081
Something to do.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.199
Tommy made everything fun.

33:15.199 --> 33:18.292
It was you that got Nikki out
of that storage room, wasn't it?

33:18.292 --> 33:19.943
Yeah.

33:19.943 --> 33:22.216
I free-climbed through the window.

33:32.461 --> 33:34.250
Nikki, come with me.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.305
- Come with me.
- What's going on?

33:36.400 --> 33:38.327
I don't get this.

33:38.830 --> 33:41.089
And then what happened?

33:41.165 --> 33:43.034
I left.

33:43.830 --> 33:44.957
Why?

33:44.957 --> 33:46.413
Did something go wrong?

33:46.413 --> 33:48.176
Tommy went wrong.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.790
I was there to watch, you know?

33:49.790 --> 33:50.991
rescue sex?

33:50.991 --> 33:53.316
Figured it would be all kinky.

33:58.448 --> 34:00.194
Tommy changed his mind.

34:00.194 --> 34:03.146
- How did he change his mind?
- I didn't wait to find out.

34:03.146 --> 34:06.594
He had this crazed look in his eye.
I got the hell out of there.

34:06.688 --> 34:09.562
I didn't know he was going to kill her.

34:13.728 --> 34:17.139
Keith's father is here with his attorney.

34:19.005 --> 34:21.346
I want to talk to my lawyer.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.290
Everything we have
points to Keith, right?

34:23.290 --> 34:25.648
He paid for the kidnapping,
he rescued Nikki, didn't he?

34:25.648 --> 34:28.603
- But you don't think it was Keith?
- No, I don't. This is Tommy.

34:28.603 --> 34:31.481
Tommy chandler. Keith is
a lightweight. He's a follower.

34:31.481 --> 34:34.349
Well, we've got enough on Keith's statement
to get a warrant on Tommy's house.

34:34.349 --> 34:37.326
Okay, take Speed and Calleigh and let
me know what you find, all right?

34:37.326 --> 34:38.431
Lieutenant. / Yeah?

34:38.431 --> 34:40.353
There is a woman in the atrium.

34:40.353 --> 34:44.306
- She's asked to speak with you.
- Okay. Thank you.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.010
I'm lieutenant Caine.

34:48.101 --> 34:50.848
- You're Eric delko's supervisor?
- That's correct, ma'am.

34:50.848 --> 34:53.016
I just came to see if Eric's all right.

34:53.016 --> 34:54.396
He's such a nice guy.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.929
Well, I would agree.
How can I help?

34:57.022 --> 34:59.143
He was attacked in my yard.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.418
I took him to the hospital.

35:07.418 --> 35:08.995
I see.

35:08.995 --> 35:11.298
My home was broken into last month.

35:11.298 --> 35:13.493
Lived there close to five years.

35:13.493 --> 35:15.563
Eric was the CSI assigned to the case.

35:15.563 --> 35:17.638
And you two became friendly?

35:17.738 --> 35:19.794
It's not like that.

35:19.890 --> 35:21.858
They stole my TV,

35:21.858 --> 35:23.856
broke my two front windows.

35:23.856 --> 35:27.081
Eric bought me an old TV,
replaced the glass,

35:27.081 --> 35:28.975
he even took my son to a ball game.

35:28.975 --> 35:32.020
Yesterday he came to fix my fence.

35:32.020 --> 35:33.640
The kid's father died

35:33.640 --> 35:35.882
three years ago september.

35:35.976 --> 35:38.362
It hasn't been easy.

35:38.600 --> 35:42.076
Well, losing somebody close
can be hard, can't it?

35:42.076 --> 35:43.925
Eric's been so helpful.

35:43.925 --> 35:46.278
I just wanted you to know that.

35:46.384 --> 35:49.743
Maybe, maybe you can give him
a medal or something?

35:49.743 --> 35:51.593
I'll look into it.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.901
So, Hector,

35:59.056 --> 36:01.402
it's time for let's make a deal.

36:01.869 --> 36:04.016
I'm listening.

36:05.242 --> 36:07.780
We found your DNA on a contact lens.

36:07.780 --> 36:11.193
The one you lost while you were
assaulting a police officer.

36:23.985 --> 36:25.804
I didn't know he was a cop.

36:25.804 --> 36:27.356
Nice try.

36:27.356 --> 36:29.680
We found your prints on his badge.

36:31.487 --> 36:33.432
He's a cop.

36:40.435 --> 36:42.650
Clock's ticking, Hector.

36:43.045 --> 36:44.807
Okay.

36:45.443 --> 36:49.531
I saw Rudy nola shoot Arnold vega.
I was there.

36:57.290 --> 36:59.846
Okay, let me take your statement.

37:00.429 --> 37:03.025
Maybe the state's attorney
will cut you a deal.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.660
Hi.

37:15.797 --> 37:18.321
So, what's up with the 20 minutes?

37:19.361 --> 37:21.285
Let's get to it.

37:21.285 --> 37:22.694
You want to talk about it?

37:22.694 --> 37:24.481
No, it's all right.

37:24.481 --> 37:25.994
As a friend?

37:25.994 --> 37:28.033
As a friend, man...

37:28.033 --> 37:29.796
drop it.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.598
All right.

37:35.418 --> 37:37.993
This is what the killer
smothered her with.

38:00.407 --> 38:02.317
What's that?

38:03.690 --> 38:06.010
It's a lip print.

38:11.127 --> 38:14.608
On the opposite side of where
the victim's lips were.

38:16.217 --> 38:18.831
Look at the center.

38:20.762 --> 38:23.557
Guy's got his lip pierced.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.929
Tommy,

38:25.929 --> 38:29.942
your partner Keith told us everything.

38:29.942 --> 38:31.758
He was the one that climbed
in the window and got her.

38:31.758 --> 38:32.961
How do you know he didn't do it?

38:32.961 --> 38:37.055
Because we obtained a search warrant,
and we entered the cottage that you rented,

38:37.055 --> 38:42.225
and we now know that you came up with the
ideas while others paid for the pleasure.

38:42.337 --> 38:44.387
Nobody was complaining.

38:44.387 --> 38:47.868
I think if Nikki were alive today,

38:47.868 --> 38:50.298
she'd be complaining.

38:56.699 --> 38:59.549
Nikki...

38:59.984 --> 39:02.740
Nikki was a lot of fun.

39:02.922 --> 39:04.636
Wild.

39:04.636 --> 39:10.010
You know, it started off completely
sexual positions, places.

39:10.097 --> 39:13.940
She was even into some perversions.

39:13.940 --> 39:16.811
But soon, that wasn't enough.

39:16.811 --> 39:18.945
Soon, the sex didn't
do it for me anymore.

39:18.945 --> 39:21.332
And then things changed.

39:21.332 --> 39:22.818
Yeah...

39:22.818 --> 39:26.170
but I still needed Keith.

39:42.971 --> 39:45.334
I'm out of here, man.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.962
Then he got scared and left...

39:47.962 --> 39:49.912
afraid of what was coming next.

39:49.912 --> 39:52.883
And what was coming
next was murder, right?

39:53.283 --> 39:55.144
Eh, it's.. it's funny, I...

39:55.144 --> 39:58.044
I really thought that the kidnapping,
rescue thing would be a

39:58.044 --> 40:02.082
a real big thrill,
but after awhile, it just...

40:02.082 --> 40:04.622
it was boring.

40:04.854 --> 40:07.369
You know, ransom notes, rescues.

40:08.549 --> 40:11.741
This is the tearstrip

40:11.741 --> 40:16.782
from the box of plastic
wrap that you used to kill her.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.265
Keith borrowed some plastic.

40:20.265 --> 40:21.719
Um, I didn't know what it was for.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.522
Your DNA was on it.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.089
It's mine.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.992
- I'm sure I touched it.
- Your saliva.

40:35.143 --> 40:36.600
Your saliva is on it, Tommy,

40:36.600 --> 40:41.291
because you kissed Nikki while
you were smothering her.

40:43.701 --> 40:46.548
That's right.

41:07.843 --> 41:11.461
It was unbelievable.

41:16.696 --> 41:19.441
You did that on purpose, hmm?

41:20.661 --> 41:23.278
That's what I do, Tommy...

41:23.278 --> 41:25.556
and you made it

41:25.556 --> 41:29.597
very, very easy for me.

41:29.597 --> 41:33.522
I found the ultimate thrill.

41:33.783 --> 41:36.974
Looking into someone's eyes

41:36.974 --> 41:39.997
as they die.

41:40.341 --> 41:42.813
You know, Tommy,

41:42.813 --> 41:47.031
sending a little worm
like you to jail for the rest of your life...

41:47.031 --> 41:52.539
that will be my ultimate thrill.

42:20.633 --> 42:23.013
Hey. / Hey.

42:23.079 --> 42:25.686
- What are you working on?
- I got the jenson lifts here.

42:25.686 --> 42:27.241
Trying to find a match.

42:27.241 --> 42:29.534
Good, listen, um...

42:29.970 --> 42:33.402
Angela morton came to see me.

42:35.635 --> 42:37.034
So you know.

42:37.034 --> 42:39.716
Yeah. She's quite a beautiful woman.

42:39.716 --> 42:42.411
Yeah, yeah, she is.

42:42.664 --> 42:46.609
She's, uh, she's also been struggling
to make ends meet since her husband died.

42:46.609 --> 42:48.691
She's got two young kids, uh,

42:48.691 --> 42:52.512
lives in a crummy neighborhood
in a house that's falling apart.

42:52.775 --> 42:54.778
Her life was devastated. I, uh,

42:54.778 --> 42:56.221
wasn't looking for a date.

42:56.221 --> 42:57.604
I get it...

42:57.705 --> 43:01.803
but, Eric, you put yourself at risk
and compromised an active investigation.

43:01.803 --> 43:03.457
I know...

43:03.457 --> 43:05.486
but...

43:05.486 --> 43:10.250
you see these people's lives shattered
every day at these crime scenes, and, uh...

43:10.334 --> 43:12.942
catching the bad guys
isn't always enough for me.

43:12.942 --> 43:15.223
I understand that.

43:16.009 --> 43:19.369
Everybody does what they have to do
to cope on this job, okay?

43:19.467 --> 43:22.900
I just want to I help out
doing whatever I can.

43:22.998 --> 43:27.308
But, Eric, as a rule of thumb,
off-duty relationships,

43:27.308 --> 43:29.566
no matter how well intended,

43:29.566 --> 43:33.546
can be seen as
a conflict of interest in court.

43:33.609 --> 43:35.428
You understand? / Yeah,

43:35.428 --> 43:37.980
but, uh...

43:38.084 --> 43:41.008
how do you suggest I walk that line?

43:41.094 --> 43:43.513
Carefully.

43:44.061 --> 43:45.283
Eric...

43:45.283 --> 43:48.225
if we want to be effective in this job,

43:48.311 --> 43:52.120
we have to survive, too.
