00:02.200 --> 00:03.531
DAMON: Previously
on The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.760 --> 00:05.489
Alaric's babies
are the future of the coven.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.648
VALERIE: They would've protected them
in any way they could.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.120
They're inside of you.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.330
- Why are you here, Lorenzo?
- I'm here because of you.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.002
- ENZO: Who's Julian?
- He was the love of my life.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.011
Your grandchild was murdered by Julian.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.801
(GRUNTS)

00:20.040 --> 00:22.122
We bound Julian's life to mine.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.961
We're linked. If he dies, so do I.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.210
DAMON: Our mother faked her death,
left her sons behind,

00:28.440 --> 00:31.444
started a new family, and
went out of her way to forget us forever.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.001
As far as I'm concerned,
she deserves what she gets.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.840
Did you know Valerie was once pregnant
with Stefan's child?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.286
Valerie? No.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.448
I love you, darling.
I would never hurt you.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.210
You were right about Julian.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.204
But I'm not gonna let him hurt us anymore.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.131
I have a plan.
And this time, we won't get caught.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.050
DAMON: (GROANS) Where am I?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.444
That's right, Dallas.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.611
Home of big hair and horrible presidents.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.363
LILY: And the trap you just walked into.

01:07.720 --> 01:11.281
Unfortunately, you're not the fly
I was hoping to catch.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.843
(GROANS) So, the mystery guest
makes an appearance.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.929
Why don't you do me a favor and...

01:19.680 --> 01:22.923
Come a little closer,
so I can sort of see you.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.366
Mom?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.245
It's been a long time.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.443
- STEFAN: What's the plan?
- Julian needs to die. Today.

02:01.120 --> 02:05.125
Everything has to appear to be normal.
Julian's not an idiot.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.011
If he finds out that Lily turned on him,
we're all dead.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.482
So you embed her with a psychopath.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.489
ENZO: Sounds logical.
DAMON: Don't look at me.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.125
I voted to drive
a stake through her heart

02:15.480 --> 02:17.801
and get rid of this Julian-Mama drama
once and for all.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.408
But, hey, complicated Plan A
sounds like a happy compromise.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.000
It's not complicated.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.811
We get Julian's blood.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.482
And then Nora, Beau or Mary Louise
use it to unlink him from Lily,

02:28.720 --> 02:30.210
and we kill the bastard.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.323
Uh... You glossed over the important bit.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.169
Do you really think Beau, Mary Louise
or Nora are going to help?

02:37.040 --> 02:38.326
<i>- JULIAN: Okay, that's it!
-(COUGHS)</i>

02:38.640 --> 02:41.689
That's it. Nora is off pancake duty.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.367
(GIGGLES) Me? You were the one
who wanted his chocolate chips to melt.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.001
Melt. Not burn the house down
and kill us all.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.642
Nobody is killing anybody before we eat.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.570
I'm not wasting any of this food.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.441
Oh! Darling, we woke you.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.291
Aren't we having fun?

02:58.880 --> 03:02.566
Julian treats Lily's heretics
as if they're his own royal children.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.721
And they worship him right back.
They'll never turn on him.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.570
The old stake through the heart's

03:07.800 --> 03:11.247
lookin' like a pretty good alternative
right now, just sayin'.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.520
Well, I guess the only way
we're gonna be able to pull this off

03:16.560 --> 03:18.244
is to deploy the nuclear option.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.960
Which is?

03:21.560 --> 03:22.846
Me.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.403
I know how to win them over to our side.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.849
Oh! Great. Yeah, last I checked,
she was the black sheep of the family.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.566
What are you gonna tell them
to make them feel otherwise?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.160
The truth.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.286
This looks like quite the feast.
What's the occasion?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.561
- Don't tell me you forgot.
- Forgot what?

03:43.440 --> 03:44.726
It's our anniversary.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.606
Mary Lou and I have been together
for 133 years.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.208
Of course, she remembered. (CHUCKLES)

03:51.120 --> 03:56.411
In fact, it was Lily's idea
to host your party tonight.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.931
Really? Lily Salvatore throws a party?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.647
Let me guess,
we'll get drunk on tea and do needlepoint.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.011
Oh, yes. Nothing says
"I've loved you for over a century,"

04:07.280 --> 04:09.044
like falling asleep by 9:15.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.563
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls,
you're underestimating us.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.885
I think,
they're in for a wonderful surprise.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.365
- Don't you, my love?
- Yes.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.448
Yes. Quite the surprise.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.406
CAROLI N E: Dear, Elena-.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.205
I'm pregnant.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.801
Ridiculously long story short,
they're Ric and Jo's twin babies.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.323
Magically transported into
my readily-available womb

04:37.720 --> 04:39.006
by the Gemini coven.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.207
I guess I thought writing to you
might help me figure out

04:42.440 --> 04:44.283
how I'm supposed to feel
about the whole thing.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.569
Because on one hand,
I know how much this means to Alaric

04:48.160 --> 04:49.400
and on the other...

04:49.960 --> 04:51.928
I have no idea what it means for me.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.086
(CELLPHONE VIBRATES)

04:55.760 --> 04:57.250
- Hey.
- Breaking news.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.087
Remember all those people
Julian was stockpiling?

05:00.560 --> 05:03.166
- MATT: They disappeared this morning.
- That's weird, where did they go?

05:03.440 --> 05:04.566
That's what I'm working on.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.888
Wanna cut class today
and help me get to the bottom of it?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.565
CAROLINE: Actually, I can't.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.126
I'm...

05:13.200 --> 05:14.690
Turns out Valerie was right.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.287
Wait, you're really pregnant?

05:17.640 --> 05:18.926
Yep. (LAUGHS)

05:19.200 --> 05:20.326
How did Stefan take it?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.602
Oh! You know, totally supportive...

05:23.360 --> 05:25.886
And just wanted to make sure
that I was okay.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.524
At least that's how I'm hoping it goes
when I tell him today.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.445
What are you doing here, Lorenzo?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.201
Looking for the self-help section.

05:43.920 --> 05:49.563
Seems I've developed feelings for someone
with terrible taste and yet,

05:51.280 --> 05:52.805
I can't seem to shake her.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.490
I need to get something
for Nora and Mary Louise's anniversary.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.727
Nora used to
read this poem over and over again

06:04.000 --> 06:05.240
when we were trapped together.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.251
I believe it was called
The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd.

and love still breed

06:20.760 --> 06:23.047
"Then these delights my mind might move

"To live with thee and be thy love"

06:28.960 --> 06:30.246
(CHUCKLES)

06:32.000 --> 06:34.128
I had no idea you enjoyed poetry.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.484
Well, there's a lot about me
that you haven't allowed yourself to know.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.126
The Poems of Sir Walter Raleigh,
a proper Englishman.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.408
This looks like a decent edition.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.404
Do you really think some bauble

06:55.640 --> 06:57.608
will convince the heretics
to side with you

06:57.840 --> 07:01.731
over an evil step-daddy who spoils them
rotten with ponies and ice cream?

07:02.480 --> 07:04.801
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.090
Run. Leave town with me.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.051
Let your sons carry out their plan
while you're off the grid.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.731
Oh, Lorenzo.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.322
I can't run from this. This is my doing.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.046
You're not safe.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.131
Come with me.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.490
You know I can't do that.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.480
But if you could?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.245
If I could...

08:02.040 --> 08:03.371
Good luck, Lily.

JULIAN: Friends. Food.
Whatever you want them to be.

They've all been compelled
to see to your every desire.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.242
I've been collecting them
for this very occasion.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.682
Are you ill? Lily would never allow this.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.244

Loosen up, darling. It's a party.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.850
The rule is we may feed on trespassers.
One here. Maybe another there. But...

09:18.360 --> 09:19.930
Where did all these people
come from, Julian?

09:20.280 --> 09:22.282
They certainly didn't bus themselves in
to be our dinner.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.080
See? I told you she was incapable of fun.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.921
Come on, let's go
before she ruins our entire night.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.640
However...

09:35.360 --> 09:38.762
I suppose, since it's a special occasion,
we can make an exception.

See? Just like old times.

and none of my clothes fit,

to Julian tonight and this is sort of...

when it would have gotten her beheaded.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.890
Then why am I so nervous?

12:25.400 --> 12:27.004
Probably because the love of your life

13:50.640 --> 13:55.407
No, no, no. Fear not.
I bribed the DJ to play us a slow song.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.040
(SLOW TEMPO SONG PLAYING)

14:04.520 --> 14:05.931
Do you recognize it?

14:07.480 --> 14:08.720
Should I?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.329
Not the arrangement,
but perhaps the vocals.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.845
I'll never forget that voice.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.764
He used to sing so beautifully.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.491
To think of everything
we've endured as a family.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.247
And now we're together at long last.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.131
Like old times.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.606
Well, almost like old times.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.161
You haven't been indulging
in any of the real fun.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.804
No. I'm perfectly content with blood bags.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.290
No, you're afraid.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.720
Afraid of what?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.400
Going all in.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.521
Rejoining our family completely.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.611
You keep holding onto the hope
that Stefan and Damon will love you again,

15:07.840 --> 15:10.366
that we'll be one big happy family.
But we can't.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.643
And that hope
is causing unwanted friction.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.726
Take a look around.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.164
You have
all the love that you need right here.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.684
All you have to do is accept it.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.005
Come back to us, Lily.

15:33.920 --> 15:38.448
Let go and allow yourself to be the woman
that I fought through hell for.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.245
(BITES)

15:53.640 --> 15:54.880
(GASPS)

15:56.320 --> 15:58.687
(HEAVY BREATHING)

16:09.960 --> 16:11.371
(DOOR OPENS)

16:19.400 --> 16:21.050
Looks like someone's having fun.

16:22.680 --> 16:23.966
I had to feed.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.644
I have to convince them
that I'm on their side.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.688
Sounds like something
straight outta Rippers Anonymous.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.410
Plan's postponed till further notice.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.922
No,no,no,no.
Look, Valerie will get through to them.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.326
The plan must go forward.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.602
I can%spend
another minute with that man.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.120
Fine.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.764
Julian dies tonight.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.522
But it's no skin off my back
if you're still linked to the guy

16:46.760 --> 16:48.250
when I shove a stake through his heart.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.922
Yes. You made that perfectly clear
when you tried to kill him yesterday.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.047
What do you want from me, an apology?
Ain't gonna happen.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.282
I'm only here
because Stefan's a momma's boy

16:58.520 --> 17:00.602
and I don't want the silent
treatment for the next century.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.491
LILY: I am your mother.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.920
How can you be so cavalier about my life?

17:08.119 --> 17:10.726
Because you're already dead to me, Lily.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.203
I was 17. You went away.
I cried. I grew up.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.726
You being here doesn't change any of that.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.083
If I had to do it all over again, I'd have
left you in that damn prison world,

17:19.280 --> 17:21.123
so I don't have to see your face again.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.880
NORA: Mare.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.802
This is gorgeous. Did you do all this?

17:38.280 --> 17:39.520
Mostly.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.400
Julian and Beau helped.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.286
What's that?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.448
A gift. For us.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.410
"But could youth last
and love still breed

17:53.760 --> 17:56.411
"Had joys no date nor age no need--"

18:04.360 --> 18:05.646
Marry me.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.167
133 years is not enough, Nora.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.880
I want eternity.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.806
(CHUCKLES)

18:17.000 --> 18:18.286
Yes.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.330
(CHUCKLES) Really?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.409
Yes. Of course. Yes!

(CHUCKUNG)

18:43.360 --> 18:44.964
I'm happy for you two.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.485
What are you doing here,

18:47.800 --> 18:50.280
besides destroying
the greatest moment of my life?

18:50.880 --> 18:54.407
We need to talk.
About the worst moment of mine.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.044

18:59.400 --> 19:00.845
MATT: Hey! Let her go.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.726
So, so sorry, officer.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.563
I found this one wandering about
and assumed she was of a

19:11.320 --> 19:12.651
drinking age.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.330
What the hell's wrong with you?

19:17.200 --> 19:19.089
Let's just say I didn't get the girl.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.566
I don't think the life-saving business
suits you, mate.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.209
Yeah, why don't you tell that to the girl
whose throat you were about to tear out.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.844
Yeah, yeah. I suppose that brings
your tally to a whopping one.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.927
Damon didn't want you.
Lily didn't want you.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.767
And this town never wanted you.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.284
So what are you still doing here?

19:52.320 --> 19:54.288
I might ask the same about you.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.400
The heretics are throwing a murder party
in your precious hometown

19:59.600 --> 20:02.809
and all you can manage to stop is my buzz.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.531
You're overmatched.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.206
You've brought a knife to a gunfight
and it's gonna be the death of you.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.969
MARY: This is so typical.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.009
Nora and I have one night a year

20:57.200 --> 21:00.010
and Valerie can't stop herself
from trying to steal the spotlight.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.690
This isn't about me.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.925
It's about our family.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.206
Hold on, where's Julian?
We should wait for him.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.769
Julian won't be joining us.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.450
Hell of a party.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.410
Your mother would agree.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.450
There's a kindergarten teacher
in the powder room to prove it.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.040
Good old Mom.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.203
Bet she made you think
she enjoyed it, too.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.085
VALERIE: His face went cold.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.126
I couldn't fight him off. I couldn't...
I couldn't stop him.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.762
Julian beat me savagely.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.722
And when it was finally over
my baby was dead.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.767
Murdering my child
wasn't just some violent whim.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.930
It was a calculated, manipulative act.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.885
What are you boys doing here?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.451
It's an anniversary party.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.446
So we figured we'd come support
the pretty one and her mean girlfriend.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.169
MARY: This doesn't make sense.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.801
Why would Julian do such a thing?
What did he stand to gain?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.320
LILY; Me.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.642
I would have never gone to Europe with him
had I known about my grandchild.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.282
- Grandchild?
- Stefan was the baby's father.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.531
VALERIE: I couldn't cope.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.004
I took my own life
and became the first heretic.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.930
And when Julian saw how powerful I was,
he wanted more.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.201
We're his army, we're not his family.
We always have been.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.240
Lily, is that true?

22:37.080 --> 22:39.162
I believe every word Valerie said.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.488
When she told me what happened to her,
it was as if

22:44.200 --> 22:45.929
all the lights in the room went on.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.611
I could finally see Julian
for who he really is.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.324
That's why I'm leaving him.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.329
But she can't do it without your help.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.004
So the question is...

23:04.640 --> 23:05.926
Who do you believe?

(SNIFFLES)

23:47.200 --> 23:50.682
Mare. You heard what she said.
What are you waiting for?

23:51.280 --> 23:54.329
I'm sorry. It's just...
This is a lot to take in.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.009
That's why we stick together.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.170
We're family.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.360
(SNIFFLES)

24:23.640 --> 24:25.290
Beau, give me your hand.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.206
- What is she doing?
- Bracing herself.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.800
For what?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.244
Damon's tying up Julian right now.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.965
I got his blood.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.650
Good. They're waiting for it
in the green house.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.645
Caroline's pregnant.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.491
Yeah, I didn't really know
what to say either.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.650
Do I even want to know how this happened?

25:46.760 --> 25:48.000
Gemini spell.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.960
Twins.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.165
Not mine, obviously.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.680
Wow.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.965
You must be overwhelmed.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.201
Well, I didn't exactly handle things
the right way.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.444
You have any advice?

26:09.760 --> 26:11.285
Tell her you love her.

26:12.360 --> 26:15.284
LILY: Never forget
what she must be going through.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.561
And then, one day...

26:20.240 --> 26:23.562
Be prepared for her
to sacrifice everything for them.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.444
Not that I'm one to give advice.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.047
I chose Julian over everything.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.044
Yeah, but now he's going to die.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.611
And you can start over without him.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.245
It's too late.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.407
- So much has already been lost.
- You haven't lost me.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.166
Really?

26:52.720 --> 26:54.006
I guess“.

26:55.240 --> 27:00.167
Willingness to forgive the unforgiveable's
in my genetics.

27:02.920 --> 27:07.926
Unfortunately, Damon doesn't feel
the same way about forgiveness.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.209
Well, you were the first woman
to break his heart.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.764
He's put up a wall ever since,
but you can take it down.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.446
No.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.046
He's gone.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.244
I saw it in his eyes.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.849
- He wishes me dead.
-(SCOFFS)

27:29.720 --> 27:32.087
Do you think that
I haven't seen that look before?

27:32.760 --> 27:37.766
Damon's been practicing that look on me
for the last 150 years.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.240
(CHUCKLES)

27:40.440 --> 27:43.922
Well, then maybe you could offer
your mother a little advice in return.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.691
How do I get him back?

27:50.600 --> 27:51.840
Time.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.970
JULIAN: My mind is boggled by this
blind devotion you have for Lily.

27:59.640 --> 28:02.883
I mean, the woman mused up an idea
to keep you away from your soul mate

28:03.080 --> 28:06.562
-for what, 60 years? 70 years?
- Stop talking.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.849
And yet, here you are,

28:09.240 --> 28:13.723
essentially risking your life to be here
with me in order to keep her alive.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.369
Don't listen to him.
He knows he's dead either way.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.564
But if he can provoke you to kill him now,

28:19.800 --> 28:22.371
then you spend eternity
as the boy who killed his own mother.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.845
Aren't you a clever girl.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.811
It's a shame...

28:28.200 --> 28:31.647
I suppose your little one would have had
the same smarts--

28:32.000 --> 28:33.240
(LAUGHS)

28:33.640 --> 28:35.608
Rot in hell, Julian.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.686
What is this?

28:39.880 --> 28:42.929
Apparently whoever wins at foosball
gets to kill me.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.967
It's pinball and I have the high score.
Did you break that link yet?

28:47.800 --> 28:50.121
How do I know that you were pregnant
with Stefan's child?

28:50.320 --> 28:51.560
Are you testing me?

28:52.280 --> 28:54.362
Do you really believe I'd make that up?

28:54.560 --> 28:56.927
You lied to Lily
about your affair with Stefan.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.608
Just like you lied to us
about killing Oscar.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.122
So why should I believe
that you're telling the truth, now?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.561
All right, Nancy Grace, enough.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.964
Let the adults handle this.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.844

29:16.600 --> 29:21.322

is why you've always been my favorite.

(EXHALES IN RELIEF)

29:29.040 --> 29:30.326
(PHONE RINGING)

29:37.400 --> 29:39.926
Well, you're either really drunk,

29:40.160 --> 29:43.607
or calling to tell me
that you found a new girlfriend.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.331
None of the above.

29:46.960 --> 29:50.407
Although a drink does sound really good
right about now.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.880
(CHUCKLES)

29:52.280 --> 29:54.089
Yeah, tell me about it.

29:55.720 --> 29:58.451
Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.082
STEFAN: I didn't know what to say

30:01.440 --> 30:03.841
and I didn't want to say the wrong thing,
so I just...

30:05.320 --> 30:06.446
I bailed.

30:06.640 --> 30:10.565
Well, I guess there is no right thing
to say when you find out

30:10.800 --> 30:14.247
your girlfriend is magically pregnant
with another man's babies.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.566
(SCOFFS)

30:15.760 --> 30:19.810
CAROLINE: Look, I know that
this is happening to both of us,

30:20.600 --> 30:27.131
and you stood by me through
everything I went through with my mom.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.685
So I totally get it
if you want to run for the hills.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.803
I'm not going anywhere.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.046
Because I love you.

30:39.560 --> 30:40.971
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

30:44.440 --> 30:47.683
I guess there is a right thing to say,
after all.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.406
Listen, no matter how weird this all gets,

30:53.800 --> 30:55.086
I'm here for you.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.043
And we're going to
get through this together.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.730
Are you sure?
'Cause it could get really weird.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.771
- I'm positive.
- Okay.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.250
And I love you, too.

31:15.480 --> 31:19.326
Mare, hey. Where are you going?
We still need to unlink Lily.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.728
- I have to get out of here.
- Mare, stop.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.121
You've been crying. What happened?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.405
Oh, my God...

31:32.320 --> 31:34.322
Things have grown out of hand, Lily.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.280
- Enough is enough.
- What are you doing? Let them go.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.720
I can't.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.122
If I do, this bloody cycle will continue.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.644
And I love you, and the family
that we have built together,

31:47.920 --> 31:49.445
far too much for that to happen.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.680
JULIAN: So.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.850
One lives, one dies.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.011
You have to choose which.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.843
- I will do no such thing.
- Oh, but you will.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.651
You have spent far too long
trying to have it all.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.843
The lies, the violence...

32:05.440 --> 32:07.522
All because you wanted the impossible.

32:08.600 --> 32:13.208
Well, the truth is, you're either
a Salvatore or you're one of us.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.684
But you cannot be both.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.686
Choose.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.120
Choose.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.203
NORA: How could you do that to Lily?

32:41.480 --> 32:43.482
How could Valerie have done
what she has to us?

32:43.800 --> 32:46.485
She hasn't been truthful
about anything, Nora.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.883
Her relationship with Stefan? Lies.
Killing Oscar? More lies.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.362
- This is different.
- Of course you would think that.

32:52.640 --> 32:56.167
He took her child from her.
And you would side with him?

32:56.360 --> 32:58.567
And you would side with the girl
who murdered her own brother?

33:05.080 --> 33:07.890
- No. What are you doing?
- This doesn't represent our love.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.163
It represents Julian's ability
to manipulate us.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.845
- I don't want it.
- Nora, please. Don't--

33:12.040 --> 33:15.169
- I don't want any of it.
- Nora. Nora!

33:16.480 --> 33:17.845
This isn't you.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.083
This is not the man
that I fell in love with.

33:24.760 --> 33:28.765
LILY: You used to be kind. Gentle. Funny.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.170
No, no, you...

33:31.560 --> 33:35.770
You're still in shock from the hell
that you've been trapped in for so long...

33:36.000 --> 33:38.128
Hell didn't turn him evil, Lily.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.887
- He was born this way.
- Okay...

33:41.200 --> 33:42.531
This vervain stings like a bitch

33:42.720 --> 33:46.122
and your family drama makes
the prospect of hell look like Disneyland.

33:46.920 --> 33:51.608
So, please, one swift stab.
Straight through the heart.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.963
Let's get this over with.

33:56.080 --> 33:59.129
You chose your heretics over
Stefan and me every chance you've had.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.771
Why stop now?

34:01.240 --> 34:02.890
Lily, please...

34:05.800 --> 34:07.802
LILY: You are such a strong girl.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.806
I am so sorry I didn't see it sooner.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.487
My son.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.159
Please forgive me.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.571
Kill me.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.245
Come on, do it, Lily.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.085
You're wrong about so many things.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.804
I never had the courage
to tell you before,

34:42.600 --> 34:43.840
but I do now.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.447
You are wrong, Julian...

34:53.440 --> 34:55.681
I can choose them both.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.206
(GASPS)

34:59.440 --> 35:00.965
No, Lily!

-(PANTING)

35:04.600 --> 35:06.125
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:07.000 --> 35:10.527
My sweet, foolish girl.
I've already unlinked us.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.126
(GASPS)

35:15.880 --> 35:17.530
- No.
- Lily.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.889
(WHIMPERING)

35:36.560 --> 35:37.891
Save your strength.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.246
You're full of vervain

35:39.400 --> 35:41.129
and you couldn't break out of here
on your best day.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.402
- What the hell did you do?
- I took your advice.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.491
You see, you're right.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.563
I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own
so I made some friends who could help.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.722
- And who are these friends?
- Sorry, I can't tell you.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.249
See, they'd like to introduce themselves.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.889
I guess I was wrong.
Someone wanted you, after all.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.766
(CLANGING)

36:10.080 --> 36:13.209
The splinters must be inside your heart...
I can't get them out!

36:14.080 --> 36:15.366
Nora...

36:16.200 --> 36:17.440
It's all right...

36:18.560 --> 36:20.927
What do I do? Tell me what to do.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.204
You say goodbye.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.207
We wouldn't be a family without you, Lily.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.567
I love you. I am so sorry this happened.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.280
Goodbye.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.326
(SIGHS)

37:28.160 --> 37:31.084
I guess only one of us

37:32.840 --> 37:34.683
gets the luxury of time.

37:40.440 --> 37:44.081
Promise me
you'll use yours to the fullest.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.884
-(YELLING)
-(SHATTERING)

38:05.160 --> 38:07.049
Nora gave me back the ring.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.811
What is all this?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.486
JULIAN: Lily...

38:19.160 --> 38:21.128
She staked herself in the heart.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.007
What?

38:24.160 --> 38:26.731
She thought that killing herself
would kill me.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.730
She didn't realize
that you had already unlinked us.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.040
I thought breaking the spell
would protect her.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.808
If her sons succeeded in killing me,

38:39.040 --> 38:40.326
she would be spared.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.410
But instead...

38:42.840 --> 38:44.569
No. Tell me this isn't real.

38:45.080 --> 38:48.926
- Tell me this isn't happening!
- She's gone, Mary Louise. She's gone!

38:50.240 --> 38:51.480
(GASPS)

39:00.600 --> 39:02.568
VALERIE: I forgive you for
loving him, Lily.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.170
You just wanted to love us all.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.850
There is no sin in that.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.044
She only has moments left.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.365
Make the most of them.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.646
Damon...

39:48.560 --> 39:50.403
LILY: I'm truly sorry.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.480
Say something.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.846
(EXHALES)

40:12.920 --> 40:14.649
You made your bed.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.286
Have a nice nap.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.365
Mom?

I'm so sorry.
I don't think I can save you.

You've been poisoned with werewolf toxin.

Okay, Mom, listen.

While you're still here,

41:16.800 --> 41:19.167
there's something
that's been nagging at me

41:20.520 --> 41:21.885
for a long time.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.570
I'm so sorry.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.331
Mom?

41:33.560 --> 41:34.891
Wow!

41:35.320 --> 41:37.322
You must really be having a bad trip.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.762
Your mother's been dead for years.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.010
You're not my mother.
