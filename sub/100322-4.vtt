WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:05.529
He's been here weeks.
Possibly months.

00:05.530 --> 00:08.089
<i>- Is Malcolm Wilde still a suspect?
- He's a person of interest.</i>

00:08.090 --> 00:09.919
<i>You always said the answer
was close to home.</i>

00:09.920 --> 00:11.879
So when are you going to pick
Malcolm Wilde up?

00:11.880 --> 00:13.399
<i>It's in hand.</i>

00:13.400 --> 00:15.079
What did Malcolm say?

00:15.080 --> 00:17.139
Stuck to his story.
He was innocent.

00:17.140 --> 00:19.899
<i>So the ballpark that he died
four to six weeks</i> ago

00:19.900 --> 00:22.459
- needs to be adjusted?
- Could have died months ago.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.639
Did you miss him back in September?
Was he lying there the whole time?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.239
<i>You went round there.
When?</i>

00:27.240 --> 00:29.049
<i>Two days before Jason went missing.</i>

00:29.050 --> 00:31.689
<i>- You sure it was a pick-up?</i>
- Ford Super Duty, maybe?

00:31.690 --> 00:33.249
We never went public
about the pick-up

00:33.250 --> 00:35.069
that Hannah Divine
<i>saw from the trees.</i>

00:35.070 --> 00:37.159
<i>He must have heard her
testimony somehow.</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:39.479
<i>I'm not your puppet.
It's not my fault</i>

00:39.480 --> 00:41.059
you're desperate and he's
not cracking.

00:41.060 --> 00:42.369
He did it, Nikki.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.450
Tricking me into menacing a suspect,
that is something else entirely.

SILENT WITNESS
Season 23 - Episode 04

01:15.820 --> 01:18.820
"Close to Home"
Part 2 of 2

01:35.280 --> 01:38.130
<i>So, any other developments
in the Forbes case?</i>

01:38.720 --> 01:42.880
Thomas believes Jason Forbes's
body had been frozen.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.420
And he's sure?

01:47.160 --> 01:50.250
Thank you.
He's sure about that?

01:50.640 --> 01:53.480
When Thomas says he's sure,
he's sure.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.710
I get that impression.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.640
This is a bit...
cloak and dagger.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.799
Well, I wanted make sure
we wouldn't be disturbed.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.109
Well, job done.

02:05.110 --> 02:06.620
I'll cut to the chase.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.419
The National Crime Agency

02:08.419 --> 02:11.129
are building their own lab in
Birmingham.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.359
No expense spared,
lab to end all labs, etc.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.319
- OK.
- They've got a panel of experts

02:15.320 --> 02:17.719
helping the architects
to design the place.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.479
They're short
a forensic scientist

02:20.480 --> 02:23.150
of experience and distinction.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.310
You want me?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.359
What about the Lyell?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.910
Well, you'd carry on as normal,
I'd square it with Thomas.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.919
Well?

02:31.920 --> 02:35.190
Well, I'm intrigued.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.999
Why me?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.760
The Simon Hill murder.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.859
Without you, we wouldn't have got
close to Carl Brady.

02:41.860 --> 02:45.039
He wasn't even on our radar
until you found those e-mails.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.169
Just another worried teacher,

02:47.170 --> 02:49.179
concerned about his pupil's
whereabouts.

02:49.180 --> 02:50.960
Well, the respect's mutual, Tim.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.579
Is that a yes?

02:54.580 --> 02:58.130
It's a "I'll think about it."

02:58.820 --> 03:00.120
Fair enough.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.990
SIMON HILL
CRIME SCENE DOCUMENTATION

03:49.320 --> 03:52.009
Nikki, did Jason Forbes'
full GP records

03:52.010 --> 03:54.360
list a prescription for
Lorazepam?

03:57.640 --> 03:59.959
- No.
- Any other tranquillizer?

03:59.960 --> 04:02.189
You found Lorazepam in his system?

04:02.190 --> 04:05.790
Mm. Low, but consistent dose,
spread over several weeks.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.679
I got a call from Assistant
Commissioner Holloway.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.389
CPS are reviewing the Wilde
evidence. They want to meet up.

04:11.390 --> 04:12.699
- Right, good.
- Yeah,

04:12.700 --> 04:15.609
from a Lyell perspective,
this is quite an opportunity.

04:15.610 --> 04:17.610
We could shore up a
lot of future work.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.209
Don't you think it's odd that
they changed labs

04:21.209 --> 04:23.210
after they found Jason's body?

04:24.600 --> 04:26.479
No, not particularly. Why?

04:26.480 --> 04:28.339
When he went missing,
they used a local lab

04:28.340 --> 04:31.519
with a more than reputable
forensics and pathology unit.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.929
I quizzed Ashby about it.

04:32.930 --> 04:35.419
She implied it was Holloway's
decision.

04:35.420 --> 04:39.039
I got the strong sense
that she thought it was odd, too.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.399
You quizzed her about it?
On what grounds?

04:41.400 --> 04:43.109
This is exactly the kind of case

04:43.110 --> 04:44.919
we need to get
back on our feet.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.359
How and why it fell in our laps -
not our concern.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.059
You think it's just a coincidence
that Holloway knows Clarissa?

04:50.060 --> 04:51.360
Yes.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.759
Did he mention the sabotage?

04:55.760 --> 04:57.949
He didn't suggest that by
coming to us,

04:57.950 --> 05:01.300
he was doing us a favour,
helping us back on our feet?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.639
- So he did?
- Nikki...

05:05.640 --> 05:08.319
I don't think you realise...
And why would you?

05:08.320 --> 05:11.109
You don't see your bank statement
from January through December.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.479
I don't think you realise
quite how hard this has hit us.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.799
Wilde's facing a life sentence.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.919
Our duty is to the truth,
not Holloway.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.159
No matter how much work he sends us.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.000
- It goes without saying.
- Does it?

05:28.440 --> 05:29.760
Yeah?

05:32.130 --> 05:34.140
OK.
Yeah.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.719
- Hello again.
- Hello.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.120
Thank you.

05:48.500 --> 05:52.319
I'm required to strongly advise
you against seeing Jason,

05:52.320 --> 05:55.359
as there's been considerable
degradation to the body.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.119
- However, I...
- Thank you.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.820
I need to see him.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.150
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.180
Peter, can I have
a quick word, please?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.110
We can wait in the office.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.800
I have a question for you,

06:15.801 --> 06:17.799
and I need you
to answer honestly.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.350
- Because...
- What's the question?

06:20.920 --> 06:22.220
Were you...

06:22.560 --> 06:24.689
Are you in a relationship

06:24.690 --> 06:27.859
with Sue Davis,
Jason's judo instructor?

06:27.860 --> 06:30.439
- Who've you been talking to?
- I need an answer, Peter.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.449
Well, it's a pack of lies,
there's your answer.

06:32.450 --> 06:34.120
So there's nothing in it at all?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.199
All right, me and Sue were an item
years ago.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.609
And we're still mates.
That's it.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.959
And you've had no trysts
more recently?

06:42.960 --> 06:44.269
The motorhome, say,

06:44.270 --> 06:46.570
when Tina's on the night
shift at the hospital?

06:47.990 --> 06:50.599
Look, this goes towards the
credibility of a witness.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.679
- So I need you...
- No, never.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.560
And Sue will back me up.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.670
Are we done, Claire?

07:05.720 --> 07:07.160
My boy...

07:08.680 --> 07:10.560
My boy...

07:12.340 --> 07:14.199
You're letting us see him.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.799
Must mean you've finished
with him, yeah?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.900
We've done the postmortem,
yes.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.780
You got the answers
you're looking for?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.080
Some of them.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.340
He was shot?

07:27.140 --> 07:28.440
Yes.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.960
Where?

07:31.960 --> 07:33.260
In the back.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.100
Was he...

07:39.520 --> 07:41.500
Was he sexually...

07:44.020 --> 07:46.359
Well?
Was he?

07:46.360 --> 07:50.279
The offender made a concerted
effort to leave no DNA.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.400
- One possible interpretation...
- All right, all right, Christ.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.679
So the histology indicated
that Jason's body had been frozen

08:07.680 --> 08:10.069
for months, not weeks.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.749
From a CPS perspective,

08:11.750 --> 08:14.589
the smaller the window for
time of death, the better.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.599
Well, blood results help there.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.800
I found trace amounts of Lorazepam.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.579
I conducted a hair test.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.779
It shows Jason was given the
tranquillizer

08:23.780 --> 08:25.439
at regular intervals

08:25.440 --> 08:29.189
for about one month,
after which he was killed.

08:29.190 --> 08:30.969
The body was then placed
in a freezer for roughly five months

08:30.970 --> 08:33.720
before it was removed...

08:34.559 --> 08:36.458
..and left in a ditch
on Mayhew Farm,

08:36.460 --> 08:38.359
where it was discovered four
to six weeks later.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.019
There's a fair amount of roughlys
and abouts in your chronology.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.078
Well, that's because we
have a fair few unknowns.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.999
The exact temperature of the freezer

08:46.000 --> 08:47.909
where the body was stored,
for example.

08:47.910 --> 08:50.060
We've run tests on the freezer in
Wilde's basement.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.410
It's negative for Jason's DNA.
I also tested the rifle.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.170
It's not the weapon used
to kill Jason.

08:55.540 --> 08:58.239
It would have been nice to have a
heads up on the ballistics.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.099
Well, the results only came
in just before you did.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.800
Right. Thanks, Jack.
It's really not a problem.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.859
So, isn't it possible

09:06.860 --> 09:10.329
that even if Wilde didn't
actually freeze his body,

09:10.330 --> 09:13.079
it doesn't mean
he didn't abduct and kill him?

09:13.080 --> 09:14.749
You've lost me.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.359
Well, I can see a scenario
where Malcolm persuades his dad

09:17.360 --> 09:18.660
to clean up his mess.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.519
- Why would he do that?
- To save his only son.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.799
We're sure we're not viewing
the evidence selectively

09:23.800 --> 09:25.279
to support Wilde's guilt?

09:25.280 --> 09:28.039
We're simply exploring
possibilities, Dr. Alexander.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.149
And let's not forget
that Malcolm's father tried

09:30.150 --> 09:32.359
and failed to beat a
confession out of him.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.219
Tortured him, to call
it what it was.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.560
And Malcolm still maintained
his innocence.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.499
Well, it's been great having
the science laid out first hand,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.519
but first off,

09:45.520 --> 09:49.519
I see a wealth of trace
evidence tying Wilde

09:49.520 --> 09:53.490
to what is a pretty remote
deposition site.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.379
That, along with his predilection
for young boys,

09:57.380 --> 10:00.639
his confessed stalking
of the Forbes home

10:00.640 --> 10:05.059
and his total lack
of alibi is enough.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.809
You'll recommend
a murder charge?

10:06.810 --> 10:09.439
- This afternoon.
- Great.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.810
Thank you, everyone.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.669
We need to explain the Lorazepam.

10:19.670 --> 10:22.119
If Wilde wasn't prescribed it,
where did he get it?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.729
We don't need to answer every
question to bring a charge.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.519
Maybe his dad was prescribed it?

10:26.520 --> 10:28.379
Charging is premature,
and you know it.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.559
- It's out of my hands.
- Really?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.610
I thought you were the senior
investigating officer?

10:34.600 --> 10:37.799
What about the pick-up that Hannah
and Malcolm both saw independently?

10:37.800 --> 10:40.739
Well, he must have overheard something
at the station. These things happen.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.599
We're about to send a
potentially innocent man

10:42.600 --> 10:44.800
to prison,
and that's the best you can do?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.020
You with us, Claire?

10:55.760 --> 10:58.710
<i>They were about to take
us in to see Jason's body.</i>

11:00.480 --> 11:02.980
And Claire asked me if we're seeing
each other.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.480
Jesus.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.180
We're monsters, aren't we?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.199
What did you say?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.240
What do you think?
I denied it.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.010
But Ashby knows,
she absolutely knows.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.500
I think Jason did, too.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.320
What?

11:29.600 --> 11:32.000
Our last session together,
he was off.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.919
Distant.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.159
What, with you or with everyone?

11:37.160 --> 11:38.880
It's hard to say.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.900
He didn't know, there's...
There's no way.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.780
Sue...

11:58.480 --> 11:59.780
That day...

12:03.320 --> 12:04.940
I offered him a lift.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.639
He declined.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.130
Did you tell the police this?

12:09.920 --> 12:11.890
And why didn't you tell me?

12:12.840 --> 12:14.710
Because you were in hell.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.810
Because if he didn't get
into my car for that reason...

12:22.280 --> 12:24.410
..then we put him in harm's way.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.620
Then, yeah, we are monsters.

12:41.640 --> 12:45.550
Malcolm Wilde, I'm charging you
<i>with the murder of Jason Forbes.</i>

12:46.120 --> 12:49.039
<i>You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence</i>

12:49.040 --> 12:52.579
<i>if you do not mention now something
you later rely on in court.</i>

12:52.580 --> 12:55.570
<i>Anything you do say may be given
in evidence.</i>

12:57.560 --> 12:59.079
There's enough wrong notes,

12:59.080 --> 13:00.899
anomalies for us to at least ask

13:00.900 --> 13:02.850
what if Wilde isn't guilty?

13:03.960 --> 13:06.659
And, for what it's worth,
Wilde says he's been set up.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.969
Of course he does.

13:07.970 --> 13:10.079
He was named on social media
on the day of his arrest.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.389
- Which proves?
- Nothing.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.539
But if he's not our killer,
he's the perfect fall guy.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.379
Already the prime suspect.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.959
With a dodgy reputation locally

13:17.960 --> 13:19.919
that got him fired from the Scouts.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.679
OK. Could he
have been framed

13:21.680 --> 13:23.290
by the real killer?

13:26.360 --> 13:28.269
You could glean a lot
from Wilde's website.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.630
What, besides him doing
work on Mayhew Farm?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.770
Hodgkin Building Supplies.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.559
They stock the boiler suit
he's wearing.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.030
And...

13:38.440 --> 13:41.319
..the Bixley's lubricant
he keeps in his van.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.849
OK. If the killer was trying
to set Malcolm up,

13:43.850 --> 13:45.809
everything
he needed was online.

13:45.810 --> 13:48.669
Why risk coming back to dump
Jason's corpse?

13:48.670 --> 13:50.800
Because the body makes it count.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.079
Draws our eye to evidence

13:53.080 --> 13:54.779
we wouldn't otherwise find.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.229
None of this changes the fact

13:56.230 --> 13:59.159
that the evidence was sufficient for
the CPS.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.319
No, but if there's one thing
that meeting told us,

14:01.320 --> 14:04.119
it's that there's extra impetus,
pressure, whatever,

14:04.120 --> 14:06.869
to see Malcolm charged,
and it's coming from Holloway.

14:06.870 --> 14:09.399
Agreed.
Something's not right.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.259
Well, whatever it is,
if we're a corrective to it,

14:13.260 --> 14:15.150
we're just doing our job.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.559
OK. We review all
the evidence we have,

14:18.560 --> 14:21.179
but that's our remit, yeah?
The evidence.

14:21.180 --> 14:23.439
We're not running some
sort of parallel inquiry.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.439
And everything goes through me.
Understood?

14:26.440 --> 14:27.880
Understood.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.280
You have a go.
If you think you're hard enough.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.240
You're just not strong enough.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.470
Go on, put your back in to it.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.899
Anti-static grid weave in action.

15:04.900 --> 15:08.079
You can cut that with a machine
tool, but it won't snag on wire,

15:08.080 --> 15:10.820
and it definitely won't tear off
in a strip like that.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.510
So it was placed there?

15:15.560 --> 15:16.860
<i>I think it all was.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:42.900
<i>All right, thank you, everyone.</i>

15:49.730 --> 15:51.039
Clarissa.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.799
Sorry I didn't call ahead.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.119
No problem.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.900
I'm pretty rammed,
but come on in.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.870
We're OK.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.729
On the Simon Hill case,
you gave me my first post

16:12.730 --> 16:16.199
in the field when no-one
thought it was a good idea.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.270
When I wasn't sure it was
a good idea.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.880
That was huge.

16:21.620 --> 16:22.920
Still is.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.719
Pure self interest.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.360
You're great at your job,
I wanted you at the coalface.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.949
Look,
if I'm barking up the wrong tree,

16:29.950 --> 16:31.900
I apologise in advance.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.279
Sounds ominous.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.930
I've been wondering if...

16:39.440 --> 16:41.979
If you dumped the local lab
for the Lyell

16:41.980 --> 16:44.449
because you want
a lab you can control,

16:44.450 --> 16:47.350
the same way you
control DCI Ashby.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.059
A lab dependent on London
cases for work.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.190
A lab with a friendly face.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.950
Someone you know and trust?

16:56.880 --> 16:59.400
Certainly sounds like the wrong
tree, but carry on.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.420
It was the pick-up, wasn't it?

17:05.260 --> 17:08.410
I heard it from the scene
of crime officer on Simon Hill.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.239
Heard what?

17:10.240 --> 17:14.190
How a witness came forward
late in the day.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.690
Pavel Tadic.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.549
He'd seen Simon getting
in a pick-up truck

17:19.550 --> 17:21.039
with a man in his 50s.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.239
But CPS had pressed
play on the prosecution

17:25.240 --> 17:27.799
and the witness was ignored.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.039
He wasn't ignored.
We took a statement.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.649
When you heard
about the pick-up

17:31.650 --> 17:33.699
seen near Jason's judo club,

17:33.700 --> 17:35.220
you must have panicked.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.199
Same victim type,

17:37.200 --> 17:40.799
same deluge of evidence
pointing to a local.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.549
You knew there was a chance
it was the same killer,

17:43.550 --> 17:46.579
- and Carl Brady was innocent.
- I never even made the link

17:46.580 --> 17:48.550
- because I never doubted for a second...
- A chance.

17:50.010 --> 17:51.310
That was enough.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.219
2010, I told you.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.729
Hair from Brady's cat
could have been planted.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.039
This is news to you,

18:01.040 --> 18:02.899
but Carl Brady is appealing
his conviction

18:02.900 --> 18:04.500
for the Simon Hill murder.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.159
It would be a gift to his lawyers

18:07.160 --> 18:08.939
if one of the forensic
team that put him away

18:08.940 --> 18:11.399
expressed doubts
about his guilt,

18:11.400 --> 18:14.239
publicly aired the notion
that the real killer

18:14.240 --> 18:16.890
evaded justice to strike again.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.899
Now, if you were complicit
in Brady's walking free

18:23.900 --> 18:25.500
after eight years in prison,

18:26.410 --> 18:29.920
you'll also be complicit if he
celebrates by killing another young boy.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.980
Hi.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.519
I used to come here with my son
years ago.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.820
Right.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.120
There's a guy, used to run
this place.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.139
Paul?

19:24.140 --> 19:26.469
- Pavel?
- Pavel! That's right.

19:26.470 --> 19:28.760
Yeah, he taught my son to sail.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.119
Smashing bloke.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.990
Went back to Kyiv.
Didn't like England.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.070
Right.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.189
That's a shame.

19:40.190 --> 19:42.079
Typical Ukrainian,
too emotional.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.919
Took everything to heart.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.509
Nice talking to you.

19:45.510 --> 19:46.890
What's your name?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.350
We talk sometimes to Pavel
about suppliers and stuff.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.620
Don't worry,
wouldn't remember me.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.319
<i>The witness who saw Simon getting
in the pick-up.</i>

19:59.320 --> 20:02.319
<i>Pavel Tadic. He ran a boat rental
place on the river.</i>

20:02.320 --> 20:04.239
Can we skip back a bit?

20:04.240 --> 20:07.199
Why was Brady a suspect
in the first place?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.699
He was Simon's chemistry teacher

20:09.700 --> 20:11.979
and their relationship was...

20:11.980 --> 20:13.999
..inappropriately close.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.309
Based on...?

20:15.310 --> 20:17.919
E-mail correspondence I found
on Brady's laptop.

20:17.920 --> 20:22.379
It suggested an...
inappropriately close relationship.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.319
- Only suggested?
- Yes.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.129
But when Simon's body turned up,

20:26.130 --> 20:29.179
I found hairs on his clothing
from Brady's cat.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.480
Sounds compelling.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.159
Yeah.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.660
Some of the hairs
lacked follicles,

20:36.270 --> 20:40.039
raising the possibility they'd
been cut and therefore planted.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.849
Did that go in your report?

20:41.850 --> 20:43.150
Of course.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.179
Holloway asked me to

20:47.180 --> 20:50.059
characterise that explanation

20:50.060 --> 20:53.399
as possible, but unlikely,
and I did.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.700
Why?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.650
Well, cos that's what I believed.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.879
Only a minority of the hairs
were cut, so I...

21:00.880 --> 21:03.380
You let this man
emotionally blackmail you...

21:03.720 --> 21:05.919
Why, through some
misguided sense of loyalty

21:05.920 --> 21:08.020
because he let you out
for the first time?

21:09.280 --> 21:11.780
Must have felt like
you owed him a lot.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.700
Maybe I did.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.879
<i>When I went back to the scene...
something hit me.</i>

21:24.880 --> 21:28.100
<i>Why did the killer leave Simon
by the water?</i>

21:31.240 --> 21:33.160
<i>It made no sense.</i>

21:35.560 --> 21:37.279
<i>If he'd rolled him in,</i>

21:37.280 --> 21:41.160
<i>then the cat hairs and other trace
would have been lost.</i>

21:44.080 --> 21:46.930
Because maybe the killer
wanted the body to be found.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.769
MacNeil said Holloway

21:51.770 --> 21:53.279
was all over their case

21:53.280 --> 21:56.690
to a strange degree for a lofty AC.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.120
Is this case the reason?

22:01.080 --> 22:02.700
I think it is, yeah.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.779
Holloway's written countless papers

22:05.780 --> 22:08.319
on the so-called
"Close to Home" theory.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.599
It contends that the media obsession
with serial killers

22:12.600 --> 22:15.139
has led to a weakness
in detectives

22:15.140 --> 22:17.039
to see their handiwork
where it doesn't exist.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.799
And miss the mundane truth
that a local usually did it.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.539
Mundane and comparatively cheap -

22:22.540 --> 22:24.209
no task force required.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.059
So we're not just talking about
the Simon Hill case.

22:27.060 --> 22:31.099
We're talking about the reputation
of an assistant commissioner,

22:31.100 --> 22:33.300
widely tipped for the top job.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.730
Hold the lift, please.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.039
Dr. Alexander.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.010
Assistant Commissioner.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.859
Got a bit carried away
in the CPS meeting.

23:10.860 --> 23:12.160
Apologies.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.690
Nonsense.
We all have to fight our corners.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.770
What brings you here
at this late hour?

23:21.640 --> 23:24.930
Just wanted to update DCI Ashby
on a few things.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.410
Must be important
if a call wouldn't do.

23:31.370 --> 23:34.439
I've got results back
which expand the window

23:34.440 --> 23:36.340
when the body
could have been frozen.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.879
And how does that impact
on Wilde's alibi?

23:39.880 --> 23:43.750
It's less, not more likely,
to exclude him.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.190
Welcome news, then.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.590
Bet it's in by lunchtime.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.439
- Nikki!
- You didn't return my call.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.680
Well, you know,
I've been busy.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.040
Sorry,
I should have called you back.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.940
D'you want to come in?

24:16.600 --> 24:18.469
You look like you need a drink.

24:18.470 --> 24:20.990
I'm on the fruit juice,
I'm afraid.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.910
I'll have a lime and soda
in solidarity.

24:24.620 --> 24:25.929
What's up?

24:25.930 --> 24:28.539
We've come across
a case from 2010

24:28.540 --> 24:30.770
which casts doubt
on Wilde's guilt.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.010
AC Tim Holloway was the senior
investigating officer.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.200
Where were you thinking?

24:51.200 --> 24:54.319
To pull the evidence
from the 2010 case,

24:54.320 --> 24:57.520
I need approval
from inspector rank or above.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.159
Are we talking about Simon Hill?
I know the case.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.839
Holloway mentioned it
on the SIO fast-track course.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.119
- Which you attended.
- Which I attended.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.009
Different MO, though, Nikki.

25:08.010 --> 25:10.369
Simon Hill was strangled, not shot.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.439
Urban location, not rural.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.909
But the shared victimology's
still striking -

25:14.910 --> 25:17.469
blond, athletic boys
in their early teens.

25:17.470 --> 25:20.279
I wouldn't say striking.
Marginal overlap's nearer.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.739
A witness saw Simon
standing by a pick-up with a man.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.439
The two of them then got in
and drove off.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.029
Sorry, Nikki,
but I'm not hearing anything

25:28.030 --> 25:31.100
that justifies diverting time
and resources away from Wilde.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.950
OK.
Fair enough.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.849
Holloway's in overall command

25:41.850 --> 25:44.050
of every murder team in London,
right?

25:45.120 --> 25:48.839
When did he start paying such
close attention to Jason Forbes?

25:48.840 --> 25:51.650
A rural case that you were
just helping out with.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.110
Was it after Hannah Divine
came forward about the pick-up?

25:59.240 --> 26:02.550
I just want to review
Simon Hill's Path report.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.220
If there's no more links
or commonalities, we leave it there.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.399
How did you find me?

26:10.400 --> 26:12.380
I'm a detective.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.680
What's going on?

26:17.760 --> 26:21.119
Got a hair sample here
from Simon Hill.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.059
Looks like it was taken
to confirm DNA.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.410
Yeah, but not tested for drugs.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.399
It's not an oversight.
There was no reason to.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.189
- Right.
- Given the lorazepam

26:31.190 --> 26:34.040
in Jason's blood,
it's a test we should run now.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.540
Whatever else,
Holloway was thorough.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.329
The Forbes own a motorhome, right?

26:48.330 --> 26:50.149
Yeah, why?

26:50.150 --> 26:52.150
So did Simon Hill's parents.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.540
Looks like we should go and see
the Forbes again.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.509
Your motorhome,

27:06.510 --> 27:09.279
can you tell me about
the last few times you've used it?

27:09.280 --> 27:12.239
We only really take it out
for our main summer holiday.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.480
- And whereabouts are we talking?
- Spain normally.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.719
But last year, Jason

27:18.720 --> 27:20.799
said he wanted to see
more of the UK.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.980
So we went to a campsite
on Exmoor.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.899
And did anything unusual happen
at the campsite?

27:27.900 --> 27:31.720
Any encounters with strangers,
friendly or otherwise?

27:32.720 --> 27:34.850
- No.
- Not really.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.480
Our motorhome developed a fault.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.719
So,
who took care of that for you?

27:41.720 --> 27:44.390
The campsite owner
recommended someone.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.420
Did a good job, and...

27:47.280 --> 27:48.759
..it was cheap.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.479
Could you describe him for me?

27:51.480 --> 27:54.380
Late 50s, 60s.
Beard.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.409
He drove an American-style truck,
you know, a pick-up?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.200
Anything else?

28:01.640 --> 28:03.889
He'd been a boxer in his day,

28:03.890 --> 28:05.980
and him and Jason got talking
about that.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.500
And about Jason's judo.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.480
Jason ended up helping him out.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.360
Spanner, please.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.700
Ta.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.010
No, the big one.

28:27.690 --> 28:28.999
All right!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.710
Jason...start her up.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.300
Well, it's a bloody head-scratcher,
Jason, pardon my French.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.720
We'll go again, eh?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.860
Why are you asking about him?

28:58.480 --> 29:00.160
What's going on?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.809
<i>Just like the Forbes',</i>

29:12.810 --> 29:15.239
<i>the campsite owner
recommended a mechanic.</i>

29:15.240 --> 29:18.990
<i>Took him a day to show up,
but he was cheap and friendly.</i>

29:19.600 --> 29:21.309
The Hills don't remember him
paying

29:21.310 --> 29:24.379
Simon special attention,
but it was nine years ago,

29:24.380 --> 29:27.239
<i>and their description matches
Tina Forbes'.</i>

29:27.240 --> 29:29.510
OK, thanks, Jotie.
Great work.

29:30.860 --> 29:33.319
That's why Jason and Simon
got in his truck.

29:33.320 --> 29:37.090
- They knew him.
- Knew and liked him.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.970
The man who saved
the summer holiday.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.170
But he only seems to operate
in summer.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.550
What about the rest of the time?

30:11.520 --> 30:12.820
Mick?

30:13.920 --> 30:15.450
It's me, Ben.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.470
From the campsite,
in Somerset.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.539
- Ben!
- What are you doing here?

30:23.540 --> 30:26.069
Oh, just passing through.
I've got a job out on the coast.

30:26.070 --> 30:27.479
I thought you lived up north.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.459
Well, you know me,
go wherever the work is.

30:30.460 --> 30:32.850
- So, how you been?
- OK.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.560
- Family well?
- Everyone's good, thanks.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.959
- Fancy a spin for old time's sake?
- Got to get home.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.119
Well,
I could drop you home after.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.389
Take a turn behind the wheel,
if you like.

30:44.390 --> 30:45.859
I can't drive!

30:45.860 --> 30:47.719
Well, I'd be riding shotgun.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.689
I passed a nice flat field
on the way in.

30:50.690 --> 30:53.779
- My dad'll go nuts.
- Well, your dad'll never know
about it.

30:53.780 --> 30:57.450
Much better to ask forgiveness
than permission.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.300
Good man, Greg.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.570
Tell us a bit more about Mick.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.490
He's a bit of an eccentric!

31:44.800 --> 31:47.470
Goes dark sometimes
and don't answer his phone.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.639
But he's a great mechanic,
and he's bloody cheap.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.349
How does he interact
with the families?

31:52.350 --> 31:55.730
Fine.
He's a natural with the kids.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.590
I think they see him as a...
a bit of an outlaw!

32:00.150 --> 32:01.450
This card?

32:01.820 --> 32:04.150
- Yeah, that's it.
- And when did you last see him?

32:05.920 --> 32:07.479
Six months ago.

32:07.480 --> 32:11.059
He fixed up a VW van
and did some work for me.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.290
What did that work entail, Greg?

32:19.720 --> 32:22.510
He just changed
the engine's oil filter.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.500
Where did the filter come from?

32:25.800 --> 32:29.439
Uh, Mick picked it up for us.
Just put it on the bill.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.919
So it was brand-new?

32:30.920 --> 32:34.640
Yeah, I-I stood right here
and watched him unbox it.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.989
Thanks, Greg. We'll drop by
your office before we go.

32:39.990 --> 32:41.290
Cheers, Greg.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.720
Weird, isn't it?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.520
Running into each other again.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.719
One man's coincidence
is another man's fate.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.020
That's deep.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.909
"Before the Roman came to Rye

33:19.910 --> 33:22.440
"or out to Severn strode,

33:23.000 --> 33:27.400
"The rolling English drunkard
made the rolling English road.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.249
"A merry road,

33:30.250 --> 33:32.209
"a mazy road,

33:32.210 --> 33:34.150
and such as we did tread

33:34.760 --> 33:36.569
"The night we went to Birmingham

33:36.570 --> 33:38.599
"by way of Beachy Head."

33:38.600 --> 33:40.890
- That's nice.
- It's sad, too.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.240
Cos it's a world we've lost.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.880
A world without rules.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.510
- I should get going, Mick.
- Yeah, sure.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.599
Are your parents at home?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.360
Won't be back till later.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.199
What time?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.740
Seven or eight.
Why?

34:05.040 --> 34:07.319
- You OK?
- Yeah.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.839
No.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.139
Sit down.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.010
I feel...ill.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.260
The rolling road, Ben.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.900
That's where we're headed.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.100
We might have Mick's prints
on an oil filter.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.780
Yes!

35:03.920 --> 35:06.639
Sorry, prints don't link
to a name.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.169
Unsolved case.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.180
Let's see...

35:12.120 --> 35:14.689
It was an attempted abduction

35:14.690 --> 35:17.519
of 13-year-old Darren Costi,

35:17.520 --> 35:21.480
back in 2001, in Northamptonshire.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.199
The assailant's prints and DNA
were recovered

35:26.200 --> 35:29.659
from Darren's watch
and fingernails respectively.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.889
He described his
attacker as suited,

35:32.890 --> 35:36.620
40s,
driving a black Mercedes.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.119
And what's the location?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.859
A country lane.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.619
He was cycling home

35:42.620 --> 35:44.759
when he was run off the road.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.030
- Jesus!
- Number three.

36:55.810 --> 36:57.119
Excuse me.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.880
<i>- All right?
- All right?</i>

37:00.120 --> 37:01.679
Tim Holloway.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.699
<i>Julie Coulson in Archives, sir.</i>

37:03.700 --> 37:05.659
You gave me a list
of sensitive cases

37:05.660 --> 37:08.560
<i>you wanted a heads-up on in the
event someone pulled the files...</i>

37:09.400 --> 37:10.700
Which file?

37:12.000 --> 37:15.820
We've just reviewed the postmortem
photographs from Simon Hill.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.190
At the PM, we found this -

37:19.920 --> 37:22.919
a high-viscosity liquid
on Simon's shirt.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.059
Enough for Clarissa to ID a brand.

37:25.060 --> 37:26.599
It's KX hydraulic fluid.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.679
Used, among other things,
on lorry tail lifts.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.989
Then...

37:30.990 --> 37:33.790
we found these stripes
on his back.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.079
Looks like lividity marks.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.789
Left within a few hours of death.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.359
Any idea what caused them? Well,
the ground by the river was flat.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.599
So these marks were made
before he was placed there,

37:43.600 --> 37:45.959
which took me back to lorries.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.550
And in this case...

37:48.360 --> 37:50.359
..refrigerated lorries.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.939
The stripes are consistent
with a T-floor design

37:53.940 --> 37:55.929
used in refrigerated transport.

37:55.930 --> 37:58.839
A kind of bar-and-groove structure
used to prevent ice build-up.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.059
Maybe, but we didn't find
those marks on Jason.

38:02.060 --> 38:03.919
What we DO know is he evolved.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.579
By the time he takes Simon in 2010,

38:06.580 --> 38:09.149
he's grooming
the boys in advance

38:09.150 --> 38:11.699
and forensically
framing suspects.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.239
So, with Jason,
he evolves again.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.939
Freezing him for months

38:15.940 --> 38:18.849
before he risks returning
the body to the scene.

38:18.850 --> 38:22.079
It's possible he knows
we distinguish victims by MO,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.259
so he strangles one,

38:24.260 --> 38:27.319
shoots another
and strikes miles apart.

38:27.320 --> 38:29.990
He wants to make it look
like a local.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.719
He knows that you plough
huge resources into serial cases.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.479
And it's much better

38:35.480 --> 38:37.580
if his crimes are never
linked in the first place.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.080
Because the one thing
he can't change is his victim type.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.529
So, what does this have to do
with Mick's appearance?

38:47.530 --> 38:50.139
If we're right,
if misdirection is his thing,

38:50.140 --> 38:53.569
then maybe the scruffy clothes
and the truck are part of that.

38:53.570 --> 38:56.179
In 2001, our attacker was
well-dressed

38:56.180 --> 38:57.889
and driving a Mercedes.

38:57.890 --> 39:00.959
- Mick is like a disguise.
- Yes.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.250
That he removes once he's groomed
his next victim.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.559
We've got a new suspect.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.479
I told you to make our case
against Wilde bulletproof.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.439
Instead,
you're shooting holes in it,

39:25.440 --> 39:28.280
digging up a case I solved
eight years ago.

39:29.240 --> 39:32.150
No doubt Clarissa Mullery
put that idea in your head.

39:32.820 --> 39:35.039
Did you ignore a witness
statement

39:35.040 --> 39:37.519
about Simon getting in a pick-up
with a middle-aged man?

39:37.520 --> 39:39.979
I am not about to defend myself to
you. It's an easy enough question.

39:39.980 --> 39:42.829
I am removing you from
this case as of now.

39:42.830 --> 39:44.569
DS MacNeil as well.

39:44.570 --> 39:46.579
This inquiry needs new blood,

39:46.580 --> 39:48.620
not to mention
rudimentary discipline.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.759
- Well, my husband will be pleased!
- Not now.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.519
Hair analysis shows there was

39:54.520 --> 39:57.039
lorazepam in Simon Hill's system.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.359
Like Jason, he was given the drug
regularly for about a month

40:00.360 --> 40:01.890
prior to his death.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.330
Right. Carry on, Claire,
I need a moment.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.799
How are you feeling, Ben?

41:16.800 --> 41:18.599
What am I doing here?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.840
I didn't know what you liked,
so...

41:21.350 --> 41:23.580
bought you a whole
load of stuff.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.380
I need to go.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.650
Aren't you going
to help me unpack?

41:39.120 --> 41:43.739
I've traced the original crossed-out
number to a batch from 2008,

41:43.740 --> 41:45.489
distributed by a phone
shop in Orwick,

41:45.490 --> 41:46.950
Northamptonshire.

41:48.800 --> 41:53.129
That's five miles from where Darren
Costi was assaulted in 2001.

41:53.130 --> 41:56.079
Feels like Northamptonshire
could be his home turf.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.679
Or WAS.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.980
Clarissa...

42:00.520 --> 42:02.120
..see me out.

42:03.580 --> 42:04.880
Yeah.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.429
Please tell DCI Ashby...

42:29.430 --> 42:31.989
whatever she wants,
I'll sort it.

42:31.990 --> 42:33.290
Right.

42:34.190 --> 42:36.599
If I thought for a moment
that Brady hadn't done it,

42:36.600 --> 42:38.769
I wouldn't have asked you
to dial down your concerns

42:38.770 --> 42:40.200
about the hairs being planted.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.340
OK.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.450
I'm not sure that gets you off the
hook if an innocent man went to prison.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.690
Nor me for that matter.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.540
- No.
- No.

44:54.840 --> 44:57.180
- Hey!
- Grandpa Henry!

44:59.640 --> 45:01.999
You, OK, Dad?
Said I'd pop by.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.319
Yes, course you did.

45:03.320 --> 45:06.239
Just knackered from the drive -
still on French time.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.639
That's only an hour ahead.

45:07.640 --> 45:10.559
I see someone's still
a know-it-all!

45:10.560 --> 45:12.979
He's a nightmare, Grandpa Henry.

45:12.980 --> 45:14.600
Come on inside.
Come on.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.139
- How was your trip?
- It was great!

45:18.140 --> 45:20.169
We went all the way to Moscow.

45:20.170 --> 45:22.869
Did I ever tell you, we were
the first haulage company

45:22.870 --> 45:25.719
- to cross the Iron Curtain?
- Yeah, once or twice!

45:25.720 --> 45:27.680
What are we going to do with him,
Zoe?

45:28.720 --> 45:30.579
- Zoe!
- Dad, I've ordered some new forklifts

45:30.580 --> 45:31.969
and I've paid a fortune for a demo.

45:31.970 --> 45:33.979
And you want to make sure you get
your money's worth.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.289
- Yeah.
- I'm there!

45:35.290 --> 45:36.700
Love you, Dad!

45:37.640 --> 45:38.999
Come on, kids.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.279
Well, what was wrong with
the old forklifts?

45:41.280 --> 45:42.800
They're knackered, Dad.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.660
<i>Come on.</i>

45:51.680 --> 45:54.249
Well, if you're saying he got
his phone in 2008,

45:54.250 --> 45:55.919
then, no, I can't be sure!

45:55.920 --> 45:58.280
I don't keep records
going back that far.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.819
Is there a local
mechanical garage near?

46:02.820 --> 46:06.440
There... There was...
eight, ten years ago.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.090
How about a dairy farm?

46:09.400 --> 46:11.800
A food packaging centre,
something like that?

46:12.760 --> 46:15.519
Anywhere I might find
a refrigerated truck.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.199
You'd find a fleet of those
at Ramsden Haulage.

46:18.200 --> 46:19.840
Yeah, a few mechanics, too.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.649
Can I help you?

47:11.650 --> 47:14.660
DS John MacNeil.
This is Jack Hodgson.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.600
- Henry Ramsden.
- You're the owner?

47:18.360 --> 47:20.319
Well, in name only.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.850
My daughter runs the ship now,
but she's away on holiday.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.739
We're investigating
the recent murder of Jason Forbes

47:29.740 --> 47:32.249
and we'd like to look
at your refrigerator trucks.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.520
Absolutely.
Will you bring him up?

47:35.600 --> 47:38.119
<i>Been looking at the lividity
on Simon Hill's back.</i>

47:38.120 --> 47:40.279
<i>I think one of the bars
on the container floor</i>

47:40.280 --> 47:41.709
<i>might be damaged.</i>

47:41.710 --> 47:44.050
I'll send over a
reference image.

47:44.840 --> 47:47.280
It starts where?
OK.

48:01.640 --> 48:03.090
Different flooring.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.290
I don't see any damage to the bars.

48:12.450 --> 48:13.950
Can we look at these ones?

48:46.960 --> 48:48.800
Same width and spacing.

48:57.020 --> 49:00.590
I need to know who was driving
this truck in March 2010.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.669
I'm not sure the log
goes back that far.

49:04.670 --> 49:07.440
It should do.
They're all on Emma's computer.

49:19.260 --> 49:21.119
Sorry,
she must have archived it.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.559
Can we call her?

49:22.560 --> 49:24.469
Just...
give me a minute.

49:24.470 --> 49:25.859
All right,
take your time.

49:25.860 --> 49:28.510
Looks like you built this place up
the hard way.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.439
What I loved was that the routes
were already there,

49:34.440 --> 49:37.570
waiting to be discovered.
You just had to go out
and find them.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.039
I mean, if someone told me
I couldn't get X

49:40.040 --> 49:41.609
to Krakow or Cairo

49:41.610 --> 49:43.439
first thing tomorrow,
then...

49:43.440 --> 49:45.800
..that was all the encouragement
I needed.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.049
There we go.
The lorry in question

49:49.050 --> 49:51.059
was there for all of March 2010.

49:51.060 --> 49:53.569
Is it normal for a lorry
to be off the road so long?

49:53.570 --> 49:55.479
Must've needed some major repairs.

49:55.480 --> 49:56.940
Give me a second.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.900
- That's weird.
- What?

50:01.560 --> 50:03.219
Nothing in the repair database

50:03.220 --> 50:04.879
about the lorry in question.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.599
So just to be clear,
it wasn't on the roads

50:07.600 --> 50:09.239
and it wasn't being repaired.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.389
- So it was just sat here?
- Yeah.

50:11.390 --> 50:14.149
A perfectly good lorry
out of action for a month.

50:14.150 --> 50:15.619
Someone must have flagged that,
surely.

50:15.620 --> 50:18.599
Come on.
Mistakes get made.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.519
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.820
How d'you know?

50:23.640 --> 50:24.949
What?

50:24.950 --> 50:27.600
How do you know we're making
a mountain out of a molehill?

50:29.480 --> 50:31.919
Much of a mechanic yourself,
Henry?

50:31.920 --> 50:34.620
He taught our mechanics
everything they know.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.940
Stay put.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.340
Stay...
put.

50:51.300 --> 50:52.600
John?!

50:55.880 --> 50:57.180
Jesus!

50:58.480 --> 50:59.780
Call an ambulance!

51:02.560 --> 51:03.860
Stay with him!

52:27.400 --> 52:30.160
He killed him just to slow me down.

52:33.640 --> 52:35.720
You OK?

52:38.040 --> 52:39.340
I'll be fine.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.400
Guv, can I have a word?

52:52.480 --> 52:53.800
Are you all right, boss?

52:54.400 --> 52:56.450
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.279
Ben Taylor, 13,
reported missing late last night.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.759
God.

53:02.760 --> 53:05.579
And a witness saw a man
fitting Mick's description

53:05.580 --> 53:07.379
enter his house a few hours earlier.

53:07.380 --> 53:09.670
Get SOCOs and Forensics
to Mick's house.

53:10.680 --> 53:12.510
<i>We could be looking for a body.</i>

53:25.440 --> 53:27.110
<i>If we start round the back...</i>

53:30.350 --> 53:31.650
Ben!

53:34.840 --> 53:36.140
Ben!

53:46.040 --> 53:47.340
Ben!

53:52.480 --> 53:53.780
<i>Ben!</i>

54:28.840 --> 54:30.510
I found this map.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.420
We're here.

54:38.920 --> 54:41.610
If this is right, we're standing
in a building now.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.840
Look at this.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.640
- Ben!
- Ben!

55:05.680 --> 55:07.200
- Bolt-cutters.
- Ben!

55:17.240 --> 55:18.540
Ben...

55:22.240 --> 55:23.540
Ben!

55:50.840 --> 55:52.240
My God.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.240
Ben?

56:13.240 --> 56:16.150
It's OK, Ben.
I'm a police officer.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.340
It's OK.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.960
You're going to be OK now.

56:28.400 --> 56:31.799
<i>..our community
is much poorer for his passing.</i>

56:31.800 --> 56:34.639
<i>Jason was a boy who lived life
to the full.</i>

56:34.640 --> 56:36.849
<i>And when I spoke to
his friends and family</i>

56:36.850 --> 56:38.519
<i>in preparation for today,</i>

56:38.520 --> 56:41.360
<i>the same words came up
again and again...</i>

56:42.760 --> 56:44.750
<i>I just feel for his family so much.</i>

56:55.840 --> 56:57.839
Thank you both
for all you've done.

56:57.840 --> 57:00.720
Please.

57:01.720 --> 57:03.719
Please accept our condolences.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.020
Thank you.

57:05.410 --> 57:06.900
How's Ben doing?

57:07.610 --> 57:09.120
He's doing well.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.770
I hope they make it.

57:18.680 --> 57:20.110
Yeah, me, too.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.190
Thanks for coming, Nikki.

57:26.480 --> 57:27.990
Thanks for everything.

57:28.300 --> 57:29.600
It's OK.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.760
I'll see you in court.

57:39.720 --> 57:41.230
Good luck with the baby.

57:45.080 --> 57:46.380
Hello.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.810
- How are you?
- OK.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.679
On average, a woman leaves
an abusive relationship

58:14.680 --> 58:16.889
<i>seven times before
she leaves for good.</i>

58:16.890 --> 58:18.190
<i>We've found a body.</i>

58:18.560 --> 58:20.230
<i>We believe it may be your wife.</i>

58:23.450 --> 58:26.359
And you think she was drunk
because you found
the gin bottle?

58:26.360 --> 58:28.559
Sorry, you know what this place is,
yeah?

58:28.560 --> 58:31.349
<i>The women who come
here are not OK.</i>

58:31.350 --> 58:32.650
<i>We are broken.</i>

58:34.160 --> 58:37.160
We collected DNA from the women
she was going to meet.

58:39.770 --> 58:41.119
<i>How guilty is he?</i>

58:41.120 --> 58:45.270
<i>If you are capable of hurting your wife
like this, </i> you are capable of killing her.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.260
I didn't kill her.
