WEBVTT

00:05.122 --> 00:06.363
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:06.398 --> 00:09.591
Apparently, one of the campers lost
their retainer in the fire last night

00:09.626 --> 00:11.186
during a game of "Will It Melt?"

00:13.372 --> 00:18.250
The answer is a resounding yes.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.685
Oh, either that, or the kid has
a really weird shaped mouth.

00:22.464 --> 00:24.581
Wow, Emma, you're really
rockin' that soot.

00:24.616 --> 00:28.035
(CHUCKLES) Thanks, I've been
working on my smoky eye.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.728
(COUGHING) And lung.

00:30.722 --> 00:31.930
Whoo!

00:31.965 --> 00:33.139
C-N-O!

00:33.174 --> 00:34.307
C-N-O!

00:34.342 --> 00:35.876
C-N-O!

00:35.911 --> 00:38.953
(LAUGHING)

00:38.989 --> 00:42.282
Lou, you are also a fan of the
chemical formula for a fulminate ion?

00:44.228 --> 00:46.428
And this is why
I eat lunch alone.

00:48.381 --> 00:52.225
That and the giant man-eating
lizard you sit next to.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.678
No, I'm actually talking about
tonight being our annual C-N-O!

00:54.713 --> 00:55.537
Counselors' Night Off!

00:55.572 --> 00:57.614
Boo-yah!

00:57.650 --> 01:01.284
Yup, one night every year, we take off
and throw a killer party at The Spot.

01:01.319 --> 01:03.311
And Gladys is cool with this?

01:03.347 --> 01:07.248
No, she's away at a "canoe
conference" in Atlantic City.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.268
But the only river she ever sees
is at the Texas Hold 'Em table.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.478
(EMMA CHUCKLING)

01:11.514 --> 01:13.596
Emma, you should come with us!

01:13.632 --> 01:15.541
I wrote a new song
I really want you to hear.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.743
Ooh, I'd love to go!

01:17.778 --> 01:19.338
Well, this is awkward.
You see, we go...

01:19.371 --> 01:20.651
(SCREAMS) She can't come!

01:22.624 --> 01:25.075
Wow, Hazel runs really fast.

01:25.110 --> 01:28.150
Well, it's not like she has a soul
or a conscience to weigh her down.

01:29.748 --> 01:32.424
Tonight is for counselors only.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.542
(SNICKERING)

01:36.354 --> 01:38.455
But can't we can make
an exception for Emma?

01:38.490 --> 01:40.449
Lou, she is your bestie.

01:40.484 --> 01:43.910
Look, I wish we could,
but this is tradition.

01:43.945 --> 01:45.745
We didn't get to go
when we were CITs.

01:46.414 --> 01:48.590
Okay, I get it.

01:48.625 --> 01:49.491
I'm really sorry, Emma.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.326
Me, too. I'm not!

01:52.387 --> 01:53.920
Hey, cheer up!

01:53.955 --> 01:55.439
This is actually
a great opportunity.

01:55.474 --> 01:58.354
You and Ravi get to be in charge
of a bunch of campers tonight.

01:59.611 --> 02:02.654
Well, that sounds fun.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.897
That's what you said
about chemistry bingo.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.773
Clearly, you have no idea
what fun means.

02:09.471 --> 02:11.262
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:14.274
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

02:14.309 --> 02:16.159
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

02:16.194 --> 02:18.103
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:19.337
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:21.308 --> 02:23.633
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

02:23.668 --> 02:26.277
<i>¶ Then falling out
of a camp canoe</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:28.447
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

02:28.482 --> 02:29.642
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:31.360 --> 02:33.910
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

02:33.946 --> 02:36.187
<i>¶ Mosquitos in our underwear</i>

02:36.222 --> 02:37.914
<i>¶ Shower's broke
but we don't care</i>

02:37.949 --> 02:40.725
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:40.760 --> 02:44.821
<i>¶ This is our home away from home
away from home away from home</i>

02:44.856 --> 02:49.167
<i>¶ But watch your back
A bear just ate my phone</i>

02:49.202 --> 02:51.670
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:51.705 --> 02:53.830
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:53.866 --> 02:56.583
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

03:07.263 --> 03:09.371
See, Hazel?

03:09.406 --> 03:11.906
I told you I could fit all
the party supplies in here!

03:11.941 --> 03:14.222
I think I just broke my own
backpack stuffin' record!

03:14.469 --> 03:15.469
Nope.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.373
Ha! That's not all you broke.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.808
What are you laughing about?
Your sunglasses are in here.

03:24.312 --> 03:28.056
You know, I think I have
a shot with Xander tonight.

03:28.092 --> 03:31.885
By "shot," do you mean you're going to
shoot him with a tranquilizer dart?

03:31.921 --> 03:35.047
No, I mean, he and
Emma are just friends.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.440
And I'm here and available.
(CHUCKLES)

03:37.476 --> 03:39.217
So is that molting owl in the
tool shed, but that doesn't mean

03:39.252 --> 03:42.295
Xander's gonna go out with it.

03:42.330 --> 03:45.640
Hey, people fall in love
all the time at The Spot.

03:45.675 --> 03:47.984
Plus, I've got a new strategy.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.345
I'm not going to hit
on Xander at all tonight.

03:50.381 --> 03:53.348
I'll just let him come to me.

03:53.383 --> 03:55.634
Ha! You think you can
go an entire night

03:55.669 --> 03:56.317
without hitting on Xander?

03:56.353 --> 03:57.919
Yup.

03:57.954 --> 03:59.154
Care to make a little wager?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.524
You're on!

04:02.559 --> 04:05.827
Loser has to teach this year's
Foot Fungus Treatment Seminar.

04:05.862 --> 04:08.305
Deal! You better get some bread,

04:08.340 --> 04:10.621
because you're about to be
elbow deep in toe jam, sister!

04:11.510 --> 04:12.550
(MOUTHING)

04:16.606 --> 04:19.415
Hello, fellow Camp Kikiwakiacs!

04:19.451 --> 04:21.442
May I have
your attention, please?

04:21.477 --> 04:23.620
I am Ravi and this is...

04:23.655 --> 04:26.214
Totally unfair!

04:26.249 --> 04:27.849
I can't believe all the cool
kids get to party at The Spot,

04:27.884 --> 04:29.584
and I'm stuck here babysitting.

04:29.619 --> 04:31.219
Emma! Her name is Emma.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.974
And tonight, we are going
to be your counselors!

04:36.009 --> 04:37.601
Yay!

04:37.636 --> 04:38.727
Boo!

04:41.056 --> 04:42.680
Zuri, a little respect, please.

04:42.716 --> 04:46.092
Sorry, I smell substitute
teacher blood in the water,

04:46.128 --> 04:49.346
and I just attack.

04:49.381 --> 04:52.090
Hey, since there are
no real counselors here,

04:52.126 --> 04:53.558
that means we can do
whatever we want!

04:53.594 --> 04:55.134
Awesome.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.995
Party in the Woodchuck cabin!

04:57.031 --> 04:57.603
Let's go! (CHILDREN CHEERING)

04:57.639 --> 04:59.114
RAVI: Wait! Wait!

04:59.149 --> 05:01.374
Nobody is going anywhere.

05:01.409 --> 05:02.542
That means you, too, Emma.
CHILDREN: Aww.

05:02.577 --> 05:03.577
Ah, so close!

05:06.181 --> 05:08.331
Now, I would like
to welcome you all

05:08.367 --> 05:10.487
to the edge-of-your-seat
thrill ride that is

05:11.470 --> 05:12.769
knot tying!

05:12.805 --> 05:15.029
ALL: Aww...

05:15.065 --> 05:17.082
That is the most boring thing
I've ever heard.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.918
And later, we will stain glass
like there is no tomorrow!

05:20.954 --> 05:23.838
I stand corrected.

05:23.873 --> 05:26.257
Okay, who is ready to get

05:26.293 --> 05:27.709
knotty?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.644
ALL: Boo!

05:29.679 --> 05:30.839
Okay, that one I deserved.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.622
You'll never be able to make it through
tonight without flirting with Xander.

05:40.657 --> 05:42.348
(SCOFFS) Please.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.126
I got this whole thing
under control...

05:44.161 --> 05:45.161
(GASPS) Whoa!

05:47.372 --> 05:48.621
Hey.

05:48.656 --> 05:51.967
Oh, boy.

05:52.002 --> 05:54.961
Wow, Xander, looks like you
need to make a trip to the vet

05:54.996 --> 05:57.196
because these pythons are sick!

05:59.025 --> 06:00.634
Thank you.

06:00.669 --> 06:02.018
(GASPS)
What do you think, Hazel?

06:02.053 --> 06:03.962
Meh.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.530
I try not to think
about his arms.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.673
I really, really try...

06:07.709 --> 06:10.485
(SHUDDERS)

06:10.520 --> 06:13.200
Would you like a cookie or are you
just gonna keep eating your lip?

06:14.407 --> 06:16.449
Hey, you're cheating!

06:16.484 --> 06:19.110
All's fair in love,
war, and funky feet!

06:19.145 --> 06:21.454
Well, I'm staying strong.

06:21.489 --> 06:25.508
(GASPS) Holy Hunkiness,
Xander's about to chop wood!

06:25.544 --> 06:27.602
And you're looking at him like a
cartoon wolf looks at a T-bone.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.187
Ahh-oooh-ga!

06:29.222 --> 06:30.296
(MOUTHING)

06:32.301 --> 06:36.085
Okay, campers.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.214
This next activity is designed to teach
you teamwork and problem solving!

06:40.250 --> 06:42.401
Is it about solving our
"lack of having fun" problem?

06:42.436 --> 06:46.580
Do the words "Puzzle Palooza"
answer your question?

06:46.615 --> 06:48.022
Unfortunately, yes.

06:50.894 --> 06:51.317
(SIGHS) Ravi, just let
them do what they want.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.845
Maybe, after this,

06:53.880 --> 06:56.680
we can piece together my
dreams of having a good time.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.920
Look, Emma, I could really
use your help here.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.231
(SIGHS) Sorry.

07:05.266 --> 07:08.276
I just really wish
I was at that party tonight.

07:08.311 --> 07:10.979
Watching Xander sing the song
he wants to play for me,

07:11.014 --> 07:15.392
chop wood with an ax, fend off
Hazel with an even bigger ax...

07:15.427 --> 07:17.961
Wait, are you and Xander
back together?

07:17.996 --> 07:18.770
Why do we have a camp newsletter

07:18.805 --> 07:22.223
if we're not going to talk
about the juicy stuff?

07:22.259 --> 07:23.909
No, we're still just friends.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.587
But tonight seemed like it could be the
perfect opportunity to change that.

07:27.622 --> 07:30.999
Well, The Spot
is a magical place.

07:31.034 --> 07:35.361
Mr. Daddy said that he hated Mrs.
Mommy when they first met at camp.

07:35.396 --> 07:37.596
But then, one night at The
Spot, they fell in love.

07:39.242 --> 07:40.602
Anywho, back to Puzzle Palooza!

07:42.645 --> 07:45.455
O-M-G!

07:45.490 --> 07:47.632
That sounds just like
Xander and Hazel.

07:47.668 --> 07:52.988
I now realize that is a story
I should have kept to myself.

07:53.023 --> 07:56.182
Wait a minute, Ravi, what if
they fall in love tonight?

07:56.218 --> 07:57.726
I don't think... (SCOFFS) You're
right, that's ridiculous.

07:57.761 --> 07:59.177
That would never happen.
Now, if you...

07:59.213 --> 08:00.736
But you do make a good point.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.189
The Spot is really romantic!

08:03.225 --> 08:04.824
It's like Paris, but with less
mimes and more mosquitos.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.176
Now, how about we...

08:06.211 --> 08:07.268
I hear what you're saying, Ravi.

08:07.304 --> 08:08.720
I've gotta go out there.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.955
Great girl-talk.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.541
How are we doing on our puzzles?

08:17.656 --> 08:19.372
(GASPS) Ow!

08:19.407 --> 08:20.527
That was a corner piece!

08:22.452 --> 08:23.918
The tough one's gone!

08:23.953 --> 08:25.787
Let's get the ice cream!

08:25.822 --> 08:26.822
(ALL CHEERING)

08:33.355 --> 08:34.546
And that's how I saved
little Malcolm from choking.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.440
It's also how I found out
the water here has bones.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.975
(LAUGHING)

08:39.010 --> 08:41.185
Wow, brave and hunky!

08:41.220 --> 08:42.954
Don't you think, Hazel?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.070
I will break you.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.792
He's okay.

08:47.828 --> 08:52.689
I mean, if you're one of those girls
who likes big, strong heroes.

08:52.724 --> 08:55.225
You know what, now would
actually be a good time

08:55.260 --> 08:56.817
to review the Heimlich maneuver.

08:56.853 --> 08:58.536
Xander, you demonstrate.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.514
Now, we just need someone for
you to wrap your arms around.

09:01.550 --> 09:05.534
Use Hazel!

09:05.570 --> 09:08.437
Eh, well, actually, Lou, I was thinking
it's time for the traditional CNO toast.

09:08.473 --> 09:09.539
(GRUNTS) Nice try.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.419
(IN UNISON) We love our jobs,
we have a blast,

09:14.454 --> 09:16.037
but sometimes those kids
are a pain in the

09:16.072 --> 09:17.072
neck!

09:19.225 --> 09:20.225
Ahh, bee!

09:21.169 --> 09:23.711
Sorry, Xander.

09:23.747 --> 09:26.231
You should probably take
that sugar-covered shirt off.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.106
You know, 'cause of the bees.

09:29.852 --> 09:31.092
Good looking out, Lou.

09:34.248 --> 09:36.732
How are you
not cracking right now?

09:36.767 --> 09:38.407
Because I just jammed
a fork in my leg.

09:39.855 --> 09:41.979
Guys, guys, please stop!

09:42.014 --> 09:43.773
Zuri,

09:43.808 --> 09:46.108
please help me end
this rebellion.

09:46.143 --> 09:48.645
No way!

09:48.680 --> 09:51.714
If I join sides with you,
then they'll turn on me, too.

09:51.749 --> 09:55.242
Mama's gotta look out
for number one.

09:55.278 --> 09:58.571
But I must prove myself
worthy of being a counselor!

09:58.607 --> 10:01.407
Then you might want to stop
that game of billiard baseball.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.292
Billiard what now? Whoa!
(CLANKING)

10:03.327 --> 10:04.327
(CHEERS)

10:06.664 --> 10:08.556
Okay, that is it!

10:09.751 --> 10:12.802
The fun is over!

10:12.837 --> 10:17.365
I am in charge, and I demand you all
head back to your cabins at once!

10:17.400 --> 10:19.075
Get him! (CHILDREN SCREAMING)

10:19.110 --> 10:20.985
(SCREAMING) Zuri, help!

10:24.315 --> 10:25.990
Lou,

10:26.025 --> 10:30.353
have you noticed how sane
Hazel is behaving tonight?

10:30.388 --> 10:32.628
She actually told me
to put my shirt back on.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.540
I know!

10:34.575 --> 10:36.451
I have a feeling there's
going to be a lot

10:36.486 --> 10:37.886
of green toenails in my future.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.372
Long story.

10:41.407 --> 10:46.127
Well, whatever it is, I sure like
this Hazel better than Psycho Hazel.

10:46.162 --> 10:48.923
Oh, you know, I'm gonna go get
some more wood for the fire.

10:49.674 --> 10:51.056
You hear that?

10:51.092 --> 10:53.234
I'm not psycho anymore.

10:53.311 --> 10:55.791
So take that and shove it
right in your eyeball!

10:56.056 --> 10:59.231
And she's back.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.184
I told you my plan would work.

11:01.219 --> 11:03.335
Xander's warming up to me!

11:03.371 --> 11:04.696
Xander's warming up to Hazel?

11:06.115 --> 11:08.140
Ugh, I hate The Spot!

11:08.176 --> 11:09.534
Ow! Stupid branch.

(RETCHES AND COUGHS)

11:17.310 --> 11:19.344
What died in here?

11:19.379 --> 11:23.089
Dude, that's my fartin' quilt!

11:23.124 --> 11:25.885
Instead of stinking up the whole
room, I just do my thing into that.

11:27.778 --> 11:29.913
Have a good night, Ravi.

11:29.948 --> 11:32.188
And if you have to breathe,
do it through your mouth.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.609
Zuri,

11:34.686 --> 11:36.728
I cannot believe you are not
sticking up for me.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.814
I did.

11:39.849 --> 11:42.817
Plan A was to cut you into puzzle
pieces and shove you into a box!

11:42.852 --> 11:44.092
You're welcome.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.422
Hey, Xander,

11:48.458 --> 11:51.501
you must be sore after
chopping all that wood.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.576
Hazel, you want
to give him a massage?

11:55.707 --> 11:58.166
You mean rub down his
rippling muscles? Gross.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.787
Instead, why don't you
play your new song, Xander?

12:02.822 --> 12:04.188
Sure.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.248
You know, I actually wrote it
when I was in the bathroom.

12:06.284 --> 12:08.044
Don't need to know
about the process, buddy.

12:09.078 --> 12:09.928
Gotcha.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.004
No!

12:12.040 --> 12:13.680
He's supposed to play
his new song for me!

12:13.833 --> 12:15.457
Stop!

12:15.493 --> 12:16.684
(RUSTLING) Ow!

12:19.330 --> 12:21.170
Next time, I'm hiding
behind a rock.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.150
Emma, you're not
supposed to be here!

12:24.185 --> 12:25.460
(SCOFFS) Yeah,

12:25.495 --> 12:28.195
and now I know why!

12:28.230 --> 12:29.522
Well, you and Xander
can have each other!

12:29.557 --> 12:30.648
What?

12:30.683 --> 12:31.683
Score!

12:33.120 --> 12:34.268
Emma, wait...

12:34.303 --> 12:35.620
I don't want to hear it.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.655
Or your song.

12:37.782 --> 12:38.782
(JARRING CHORD)

12:41.185 --> 12:44.345
Well, now you won't have to.

12:44.380 --> 12:47.460
Well, the good news is, now we don't
have to chop any more wood for the fire.

12:54.790 --> 12:58.500
So, what do you want to do first now
that CIT Buzzkill is out of the way?

Oh, man,

13:14.419 --> 13:16.744
we're going to be
in so much trouble!

13:16.779 --> 13:18.387
No, we won't.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.906
Ravi is in charge,
so he'll get blamed.

13:20.941 --> 13:22.742
Wait,

13:22.777 --> 13:27.079
but if Ravi gets in trouble, he
might never become a counselor.

13:27.114 --> 13:31.483
I'm all for a little mutiny, but I
don't wanna crush the guy's dreams.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.738
It's Ravi. He's
probably used to it.

13:35.773 --> 13:39.350
Yeah, his date to the homecoming
dance was a mop with googly-eyes.

13:40.537 --> 13:43.287
(SIGHS)

13:43.322 --> 13:46.202
The sad part is, he still has
her picture in his wallet.

13:47.093 --> 13:50.611
I can't believe I'm saying this,

13:50.646 --> 13:54.098
but what we did to Ravi is kinda
making me feel bad inside.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.774
Well, if you need the fartin'
quilt, you know where to find it.

14:03.784 --> 14:06.894
I'm so sorry about
your guitar, Xander,

14:06.929 --> 14:09.297
but I was just so upset that you
might be falling for Cray-zel!

14:09.332 --> 14:11.407
Hey!

14:11.442 --> 14:13.282
Oh, like no one's
ever called you that before.

14:14.212 --> 14:15.419
Me and Hazel?

14:15.454 --> 14:17.513
Never.

14:17.548 --> 14:19.923
Not if we were the last
two counselors on earth.

directly out of my...

14:22.077 --> 14:24.237
Okay, I think we get it.

14:24.272 --> 14:28.215
Emma, why do you care so
much about who I date?

14:28.251 --> 14:31.593
When we were fishing, you said
you just wanted to be friends.

14:31.629 --> 14:34.338
I only said that because you said
you just wanted to be friends!

14:34.373 --> 14:36.174
I only said that because I thought
you didn't like me in that way!

14:36.209 --> 14:37.291
Well, I do like you.

14:37.326 --> 14:38.384
Well, I like you more.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.419
That's not possible.

Really?

14:41.364 --> 14:42.364
Yeah.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.458
So, what do we do now?

14:45.493 --> 14:46.493
I don't know.

Is that all it takes
to be with you?

Because I will burn your guitar,
your clothes, everything!

Hazel meets that special someone.

is a therapist.

I know I wasn't supposed to
come out to The Spot tonight,

16:08.442 --> 16:10.117
but I'm really glad I did.

16:10.152 --> 16:11.272
Me, too.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.932
Wait, if you're here,

16:16.968 --> 16:19.643
does that mean Ravi is trying to
supervise 20 campers by himself?

16:19.678 --> 16:22.113
Yeah, but he'll be fine.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.323
He's got them doing puzzles,
and tying knots, and later,

16:24.359 --> 16:26.519
he's going to show them
how to reduce fractions.

tied some very good knots.

Oh, dear gods!

to finish me off with...

to take a long time.

to get in trouble.

to become a counselor someday.

razor-sharp teeth,

17:14.525 --> 17:16.258

the time for bragging.

are trying to think.

But first, you may want
to change your shirt.

Mrs. Kipling,
you have cropped my top.

she got rid of that nasty mole.

How are you going to do that?

18:20.924 --> 18:22.024
There's only one of you.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.200
Two of us.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.236
(GROANS)

18:25.546 --> 18:27.921
Make that three.

18:27.957 --> 18:30.037
And Mrs. K and I are just
itching to bust some heads!

18:31.001 --> 18:32.401
Retreat!

18:32.436 --> 18:33.402
Somebody pull me back!

18:33.438 --> 18:35.688
Uh, no, Zuri.

18:35.723 --> 18:39.700
I already tried forcing
people to do what I want,

18:39.777 --> 18:41.702
and all it got me was a
bad case of Stink Nose.

18:41.737 --> 18:43.070
And probably pink eye.

18:45.066 --> 18:46.106
Oh, that is from crying.

18:48.302 --> 18:51.462
Campers,

18:51.498 --> 18:54.890
I made tonight all about me, when
it should have been about you.

18:54.925 --> 18:58.043
So, what you're saying is, you're cool
with us attacking the other camp?

18:58.079 --> 19:00.212
Boys, light your arrows!

19:00.247 --> 19:03.115
No!

19:03.150 --> 19:06.961

you guys to have fun.

19:06.996 --> 19:10.055
So, let us quickly clean up, and then
you guys can do whatever you want,

19:10.091 --> 19:13.291
but let us not be too knotty.

19:13.327 --> 19:14.526
(GROANS)

19:14.561 --> 19:15.801
I think she just booed.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.641
Thanks for not
punishing us, Ravi.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.109
Other than with more puns.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.374
Look, Ravi, I'm sorry I
didn't have your back before.

19:29.410 --> 19:33.512
I just didn't want the other
campers to think I was lame.

19:33.548 --> 19:37.191
Well, if anyone can
understand that, it is I.

19:37.226 --> 19:39.201
The pressure to be the coolest
cat in the chess club

19:39.236 --> 19:40.769
can be quite overwhelming.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.854
Aren't there only two of you?

19:41.889 --> 19:45.499
Regardless.

19:45.534 --> 19:49.203
And don't worry. I'll tell Lou and
Xander that I broke the window.

19:49.238 --> 19:52.172
No, I am in charge,
and I will take the fall.

19:52.207 --> 19:53.849
Wait,

19:53.885 --> 19:56.543
maybe no one
has to get in trouble.

19:56.579 --> 19:57.579
I've got an idea.

19:59.773 --> 20:01.949
Excellent idea, Zuri.

20:01.984 --> 20:04.576
And nice stained-glass
work, everyone.

20:04.611 --> 20:07.822
Yeah, it looks awesome!

20:07.857 --> 20:12.343
Who knew you could have fun
with glass without breaking it?

20:12.378 --> 20:13.936
Campers, please don't kill Ravi!
He's too young to die!

20:13.971 --> 20:15.731
Yeah, his only girlfriend
was a mop!

20:16.782 --> 20:19.217
Oh.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.939
Well, I guess we were
worried about nothing.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.869
Awesome job, Ravi.

20:22.905 --> 20:25.156
The camp is spotless,
everybody's behaving,

20:25.191 --> 20:26.907
and no one took over
the camp across the lake.

20:26.943 --> 20:29.860
Not yet, but soon.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.512
Very soon.

20:34.558 --> 20:37.960
Anyway, since all the campers
have been so good,

20:37.995 --> 20:39.562
why don't we invite everybody
out to The Spot tonight?

20:39.597 --> 20:43.140
(ALL CHEERING)

20:43.175 --> 20:45.284
Sorry I abandoned you, Ravi.

20:45.319 --> 20:47.453
But you did great by yourself.

20:47.530 --> 20:48.937
You're going to be an
awesome counselor one day.

20:48.972 --> 20:50.881
Thank you, Emma.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.491
And just to show you
there are no hard feelings,

20:52.526 --> 20:55.928
I have a quilt in my cabin
I would like to give you.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.204
Aw, that's so sweet.

21:00.409 --> 21:02.501
Okay, everybody. So, this
is a song about The Spot,

21:02.536 --> 21:04.862
a special place,

21:04.897 --> 21:07.648
and I want to dedicate it
to Emma, a very special girl.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.149
ALL: Aww.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.184
(RETCHES)

21:11.954 --> 21:15.439
(PLAYING GUITAR)

21:15.441 --> 21:17.683
<i>¶ When the stars
are dancing in the sky</i>

21:20.613 --> 21:23.188
<i>¶ I start thinking
'bout a place I know</i>

21:26.452 --> 21:30.103
<i>¶ Where young dreamers
hope to meet their match</i>

21:30.139 --> 21:32.531
<i>¶ And then a feeling
begins to grow</i>

21:37.004 --> 21:38.964
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh This is the night</i>

21:41.217 --> 21:44.009
<i>¶ Think of the girl
you're dreamin' of</i>

21:44.044 --> 21:47.562
<i>¶ Underneath the moonlight</i>

21:47.598 --> 21:52.551
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh This is the night</i>

21:52.586 --> 21:55.979
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh This is the night ¶</i>

21:56.015 --> 21:57.681
(APPLAUDING)

22:03.005 --> 22:04.855
Well, hello, lovebirds.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.817
Whatcha up to?

22:07.852 --> 22:11.111
Taking a romantic stroll, and trying
not to step on possum droppings.

22:11.146 --> 22:13.313
We're just talking about where
we should go on our next date.

22:13.349 --> 22:15.032
Oh, man! Well, we could take
a canoe ride at sunset,

22:15.067 --> 22:18.260
or we could...

22:18.295 --> 22:21.497
Oh. You meant the "two-we," and
not the "three-we." I get it.

22:21.532 --> 22:23.123
Well, your loss.

22:23.158 --> 22:24.998
Have fun making
your own balloon animals.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.621
Anyway, congrats again on
winning your bet with Hazel.

22:29.656 --> 22:33.892
Thanks. Guess Hazel is really
feeling the agony of de-feet.

22:33.927 --> 22:35.694
(SPRAYING) (COUGHS)

22:35.729 --> 22:37.471
Eww! So much fungus.

22:41.043 --> 22:48.198
Seriously? Are you growing
mushrooms on this thing?
