WEBVTT

00:03.084 --> 00:06.196
There. I believe Danny's old room is

00:06.296 --> 00:08.153
officially ready for its new tenant.

00:08.188 --> 00:10.043
And to think, it only took seven coats

00:10.143 --> 00:11.389
of paint to get it to stop smellin'

00:11.425 --> 00:13.812
like the inside of an old gym bag.

00:14.762 --> 00:17.061
When Ben finally moved out of
the house, I just opened the door

00:17.097 --> 00:18.458
and started parking my car there again.

00:19.589 --> 00:20.578
Can we come in?

00:20.678 --> 00:22.077
Ooh! Not yet!

00:24.015 --> 00:25.214
Okay, um...

00:25.249 --> 00:27.784
Oh. Uh-oh... yeah.

00:29.554 --> 00:31.387
And now, we're ready.

00:31.423 --> 00:33.855
Surprise!

00:34.859 --> 00:37.793
Fifty square feet of living
space, a lovely fake kitchen,

00:37.829 --> 00:39.561
and a window overlooking an air shaft.

00:39.596 --> 00:42.932
But the best part, rent is only
a daily "I love you, Daddy."

00:42.967 --> 00:44.466
I love you, Daddy.

00:46.637 --> 00:47.703
She's growin' up.

00:47.738 --> 00:50.547
Hmm? Her own bedroom, a big-girl bed.

00:50.647 --> 00:52.214
This is quite a milestone.

00:54.185 --> 00:57.752
Oh, Benji. It's gonna be okay.

00:57.788 --> 00:59.388
She'll always need her dad.

00:59.423 --> 01:01.453
Thanks. But I just realized I finally

01:01.553 --> 01:04.193
get to have sex in my own room again.

01:04.227 --> 01:06.927
Oh, my God. It's been so long.

01:18.676 --> 01:20.676
Okay, Emma, you are about to be welcomed

01:20.711 --> 01:24.278
to the amazing world of
professional wrestling!

01:26.316 --> 01:28.249
Though some might mock
you for your choice...

01:28.284 --> 01:29.483
Just know that you

01:29.519 --> 01:32.152
are on the side of righteousness!

01:32.188 --> 01:33.688
Yeah.

01:33.723 --> 01:35.423
Hey, remember when we were nine?

01:35.458 --> 01:38.725
And you crushed me with your thighs
so hard it dislocated my shoulder?

01:38.760 --> 01:42.028
That's when I first started
thinking you might love me back.

01:42.932 --> 01:44.464
And that's when I
first started thinking,

01:44.500 --> 01:46.433
"Diet, Riley. Diet."

01:47.469 --> 01:49.302
You know, we would've
made a lot fewer visits

01:49.338 --> 01:52.439
to the hospital if someone
just told us it was fake.

01:52.474 --> 01:54.874
Seriously? Why don't you just tell her

01:54.909 --> 01:57.043
about Santa Claus or the
pope while you're at it.

01:58.913 --> 02:01.247
The pope is real.

02:01.282 --> 02:02.203
That's more like it.

02:03.851 --> 02:06.719
Wait. Yeah, I think I know that guy.

02:06.754 --> 02:08.955
Ryan Davidson. He was my roommate

02:08.990 --> 02:10.423
during training camp.

02:10.459 --> 02:12.191
The last spot on the team
came down to the two of us,

02:12.226 --> 02:13.292
and I got it.

02:13.327 --> 02:15.394
I always wondered what happened to him.

02:15.429 --> 02:17.028
Maybe you should give him a call.

02:17.064 --> 02:18.730
He doesn't wanna talk to me.

02:18.765 --> 02:21.433
I'm still a Ranger and he's a wrestler.

02:21.469 --> 02:23.535
He's livin' the dream.

02:25.606 --> 02:27.372
I really hope the baby gets your eyes.

02:32.346 --> 02:33.545
Ooh! Tucker, perfect!

02:33.822 --> 02:34.921
I need some expert advice.

02:34.956 --> 02:36.689
Dude, I told you. I'm not a doctor.

02:36.724 --> 02:40.593
I mean, I'll look at
it if you want me to.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.529
What? No, no, I'm trying
to craft the perfect text

02:43.565 --> 02:46.197
to seal the deal with this girl
I right-swiped this morning.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.398
Too bad there's no emoji that says,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.334
"Hey, wanna just come
over and have sex?"

02:49.369 --> 02:53.011
Ah, the question all
men wish they could ask.

02:53.140 --> 02:56.608
I mean, other than, "Why can't you
be ready when you say you will?"

02:57.578 --> 02:58.944
Is it so wrong that all I wanna do

02:58.980 --> 03:01.813
is christen my room and not be
bogged down with all that caring

03:01.848 --> 03:03.815
or name learning?

03:05.451 --> 03:07.986
Karma got it right by
givin' you a daughter.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.691
I'm walkin' a tightrope here, man.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.580
Too sweet and she thinks
we're starting a relationship.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.613
Too direct and it's
over before it starts.

03:16.648 --> 03:17.980
There's just no way to say it.

03:20.351 --> 03:21.917
"How about I come over
around 11 tonight?"

03:21.953 --> 03:23.124
There's one way to say it.

03:24.053 --> 03:26.587
It's her. That is what
she's saying, right?

03:26.613 --> 03:27.221
Yeah.

03:27.256 --> 03:28.956
Oh, my God, it's a miracle.

03:28.992 --> 03:31.959
- Hey, guys, what's goin' on?
- Oh, Ben just found a bang buddy.

03:33.162 --> 03:36.963
I really enjoy our little talks.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.832
So, how do you decide
who's gonna win or lose?

03:39.868 --> 03:42.224
Oh! And have you ever gotten in
a real fight during a fake fight?

03:42.324 --> 03:43.690
Oh, and... and... why
is it called a ring

03:43.726 --> 03:46.026
when it's actually shaped like a square?

03:46.061 --> 03:47.227
Sorry, I got so many questions.

03:47.262 --> 03:49.696
I'm just a huge fan!

03:49.732 --> 03:51.130
Don't be too impressed.

03:51.165 --> 03:53.966
I'm in what you might
call a second-tier league.

03:54.002 --> 03:56.368
Most people who come to see us
just wanna get out of the cold.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.071
Second tier is still impressive.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.451
I'd kill to get in any ring.

04:00.551 --> 04:03.886
Well... fake kill. I know how it works.

04:05.256 --> 04:06.889
I could probably make that happen.

04:06.924 --> 04:07.955
Seriously?

04:07.991 --> 04:09.690
Maybe you could be a
special guest fighter.

04:09.726 --> 04:11.526
I mean, wrestling a New York Ranger,

04:11.561 --> 04:13.361
that kind of publicity
would really help us out.

04:13.397 --> 04:15.230
Dude, that'd be amazing.

04:15.265 --> 04:17.165
Can I come up with
my own signature move?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.298
Can I hit you with a chair?

04:18.334 --> 04:21.302
Oh, my God, it's all happening so fast.

04:22.473 --> 04:24.906
- Oh. Hey,
Tuck-Tuck. - What up?

04:24.941 --> 04:27.608
Rockin' some plaid today, huh? Okay.

04:27.644 --> 04:29.410
Oh God! Oh, my God!

04:29.446 --> 04:31.051
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:31.538 --> 04:33.137
Oh God, what is he doing here?

04:33.172 --> 04:34.439
Who?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.443
What, the guy with
Danny? Do you know him?

04:38.478 --> 04:41.088
Yes! I know him. I ruined him!

04:41.347 --> 04:43.480
- What, did you have sex with him?
- Yeah.

04:44.583 --> 04:47.317
- Oh, I was kidding.
- Oh God.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.286
During Danny's first training camp,

04:49.321 --> 04:52.055
it came down to the two
of them for the final spot.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.524
So, the night before the last practice,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.729
I took Ryan out and
filled him full of booze,

04:56.829 --> 04:58.194
and, you know, one thing led to another,

04:58.230 --> 05:00.631
and let's just say, Danny made the team.

05:02.034 --> 05:03.099
Does Danny know?

05:03.135 --> 05:04.167
Oh God, no!

05:04.202 --> 05:05.802
He would be crushed if he
learned he made the team

05:05.838 --> 05:07.811
because I scored and he didn't!

05:09.018 --> 05:10.940
I was never here.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.582
Wait. Wait.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.952
So, you think this girl
is coming over tonight

05:20.987 --> 05:23.654
for no reason other than
to have sex with you.

05:23.689 --> 05:28.492
Did I stutter? If I did, it's
only because I'm s-s-s-so excited.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.395
Okay, well, that kind of
girl is like a unicorn.

05:31.430 --> 05:34.831
She doesn't exist. Tonight
it's sex, tomorrow it's...

05:34.866 --> 05:38.201
"Hey, babe, sell the Porsche.
We need to get a minivan."

05:39.905 --> 05:42.298
I am telling you, she's
just looking for an in.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.892
So am I, Riley. So am I.

05:46.462 --> 05:49.662
Ben, women don't have sex unless
they have feelings for you,

05:49.762 --> 05:52.263
so if you're not in it for
the feelings, well, then...

05:52.298 --> 05:56.066
you won't be feeling anything of hers.

05:56.101 --> 05:57.683
Really? So just
bottom-line me, what is the

05:57.783 --> 05:59.745
absolute least I have to do to get some?

06:02.157 --> 06:03.723
Well, Romeo,

06:03.758 --> 06:07.093
uh, if you really wanna
christen the room...

06:07.128 --> 06:09.528
which by the way, ew...

06:09.563 --> 06:12.898
uh, you're gonna need
some candles, some wine,

06:12.934 --> 06:15.300
perhaps treat her like a human being.

06:15.336 --> 06:17.436
How about two out of three?

06:18.439 --> 06:21.206
What the hell was that?

06:23.610 --> 06:25.844
Hey, guys!

06:26.980 --> 06:28.647
Yeah, they wanted to
practice at our place,

06:28.682 --> 06:31.617
but I felt more comfortable
with them breaking your stuff.

06:34.522 --> 06:37.241
By the time the slow-witted tortoise

06:37.341 --> 06:40.342
woke up after an evening in the forest,

06:40.378 --> 06:42.823
the momma bear had
ruined his hockey career.

06:43.014 --> 06:45.114
Now she was worried that the tortoise

06:45.149 --> 06:49.085
had figured it out, and
was laying a bear trap.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.753
You get that I'm the momma bear, right?

06:50.789 --> 06:51.955
Yes.

06:51.990 --> 06:55.090
Do you think that Ryan figured
out that I'm Danny's mom,

06:55.125 --> 06:56.951
- and put it all together?
- Yes.

06:57.051 --> 06:59.551
Wow, you're wise.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.453
What is going on out there?

07:01.489 --> 07:03.489
This is usually the point in the video

07:03.524 --> 07:05.324
when I realize I've
downloaded the wrong one.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.000
Oh. Hey, Mrs. Wheeler. You
lose your "vitamins" again?

07:16.036 --> 07:19.270
Tucker. All right,
Tucker? Can I speak to you

07:19.305 --> 07:21.257
in Emma's room for a moment, huh?

07:22.776 --> 07:25.809
- Tea party!
- Oh, of course, sweetie, yes!

07:25.845 --> 07:29.913
I promised a tea party. Oh, how lovely.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.182
Oh, my goodness. Oh...

07:32.217 --> 07:34.902
So, why didn't you

07:35.002 --> 07:37.621
tell me that Ryan was here, gov'nah?

07:37.657 --> 07:39.523
Because I
didn't care, Your Highness.

07:39.558 --> 07:41.905
Oh. Oh, well. Well, if
you don't start caring,

07:42.005 --> 07:45.005
- I will shove a scone so far up your...
- Good point, love! Okay!

07:46.642 --> 07:48.612
I, uh, I heard Danny
is going to wrestle him

07:48.712 --> 07:49.915
tomorrow night for publicity.

07:50.015 --> 07:53.517
What? Don't
you see what's happening?

07:53.552 --> 07:56.119
Danny is living the
life Ryan should've had.

07:56.154 --> 08:00.356
But I destroyed him, so
he's here to destroy Danny!

08:00.391 --> 08:01.991
Oh.

08:02.026 --> 08:03.926
Oh, I mean... I do believe he will

08:03.962 --> 08:06.796
get him in the ring and
just shred him to pieces.

08:06.831 --> 08:09.866
Ahh, I need your help. We need
to stop Danny from wrestling

08:09.901 --> 08:11.997
without telling him the truth. Mm-hm.

08:12.097 --> 08:14.414
Oh. Please, Emma?

08:15.732 --> 08:16.765
Oh.

08:18.769 --> 08:21.336
It's up to you, Tucker, where this goes.

08:27.244 --> 08:28.461
Anita! Yes!

08:28.561 --> 08:32.094
You look like your
profile pick. Finally!

08:32.129 --> 08:34.730
- Do I look like mine?
- Meh.

08:38.501 --> 08:41.070
Can I offer you a glass of
wine and some soft candlelight

08:41.105 --> 08:42.719
while we get to know each other better?

08:42.741 --> 08:45.107
Well, I don't drink, and I'm
actually meeting some friends

08:45.143 --> 08:47.810
in a half hour, so...

08:47.845 --> 08:50.895
So, you
wanna go straight to...?

08:50.995 --> 08:52.827
Your room. Is that okay?

08:52.863 --> 08:57.099
Is that okay? That wins the award
for most okay statement ever.

08:57.134 --> 08:58.124
Yeah, it's just over
there to the left.

08:58.224 --> 09:00.060
Will you excuse me
for just one second?

09:06.076 --> 09:07.174
Hey. What do you want?

09:07.210 --> 09:09.010
Just delivering some breaking news.

09:09.045 --> 09:11.479
Unicorns are real, and
I'm about to go tame one.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.427
I'm tellin' you, it was perfect.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.926
She just got up and left.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.762
No obligatory cuddle,
no awkward conversation

09:24.798 --> 09:26.465
about when we're gonna
see each other again.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.600
Wait. What was the name
of this app you met her on?

09:29.737 --> 09:30.881
Right, but you're gonna have to see her

09:30.981 --> 09:32.937
again to give her back her earring.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.040
Wait. What? How do you
know Anita left her earring?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.450
Because a bra is too obvious, and you

09:37.550 --> 09:39.210
can't walk home without your shoes.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.847
Sure, she's fine with the
11 p.m. booty call now,

09:42.882 --> 09:44.682
but Anita is playing the long game,

09:44.718 --> 09:47.018
and you're falling for
every trick in the book.

09:47.053 --> 09:50.053
No. Never happening. Anita's
not that kind of girl.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.182
Oh, my God! My watch stopped, all
the clocks in the house are wrong,

09:53.282 --> 09:54.388
and I don't know where my phone is.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:04.365 --> 10:07.498
Oh my G... How did that get there?

10:07.533 --> 10:09.834
I'm already an hour late
for wrestling practice. Oh!

10:09.869 --> 10:11.869
Guys, don't forget, my
big match is tonight.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.639
I lose, but
you won't see it coming.

10:15.675 --> 10:18.401
Oh! Hey. Hey, honey, I
just came by to stop you.

10:18.501 --> 10:19.967
I mean, get you... um, talk to you.

10:20.002 --> 10:21.335
No time, Ma. I've got
to get to the ring.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.202
Oh! Well, then, it's a good
thing I caught you, then,

10:23.238 --> 10:25.071
because I just discovered
that you can't wrestle,

10:25.106 --> 10:26.840
because it's against your
contract with the Rangers.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.191
Oh. Yeah, I knew about that.

10:28.217 --> 10:29.375
That's why I already
cleared it with the team.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.411
Oh God, you picked now
to read your contract?

10:31.447 --> 10:32.666
- Um...
- Mom, I gotta go.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.108
Oh, let me just hug you
before you go, honey.

10:34.134 --> 10:34.633
Mom... Mom...

10:34.668 --> 10:36.602
- Let me hug you. Let me hug you!
- Mom. Mom. Mom.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.670
- I love you! I love you!
- Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, let me go!

10:38.706 --> 10:39.555
I love you!

10:39.555 --> 10:42.022
Listen, Danny, all right,
have fun, and don't look back.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.792
Seriously, on the way
there, don't look back!

10:44.827 --> 10:47.027
Okay. Tucker!

10:49.732 --> 10:51.685
Is it just me, or is my
mom acting kind of weird?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.483
It's never just you.

10:53.583 --> 10:56.282
Oh! Oh, the phone!

10:56.318 --> 10:58.652
Ten bucks says that's
her, she had a great time,

10:58.687 --> 11:00.019
and she can't wait to see you again.

11:00.055 --> 11:01.688
Well, you're on.

11:01.723 --> 11:04.958
And it is from Anita. And
she says, "Had a nice time.

11:04.993 --> 11:07.360
Can't... wait to see you again."

11:07.395 --> 11:11.965
Ah! Oh! I knew it! God, I hate
that we are so predictable.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.498
Ooh, a follow-up.

11:13.598 --> 11:16.298
"Maybe I can swing by for
20 minutes at lunch time."

11:16.334 --> 11:18.801
Why would she wanna do that?

11:18.837 --> 11:21.319
She's horny.

11:26.911 --> 11:29.978
Mrs. Wheeler,
wrestling is Danny's dream.

11:30.014 --> 11:33.190
I mean, his odd, kind of
creepy, kind of man-grabby dream,

11:33.290 --> 11:34.956
but you're never gonna
get him to quit now.

11:34.992 --> 11:38.627
I know. Which is why I am
gonna have to stop Ryan myself.

11:38.662 --> 11:40.729
Do I even need to ask how?

11:40.765 --> 11:42.829
Seducing Ryan is what
got me into this mess,

11:42.929 --> 11:45.229
and seducing Ryan is
gonna get me out of it.

11:45.264 --> 11:46.530
Nope, I had it.

11:46.565 --> 11:49.366
Look, I'm just gonna get him drunk
and lock him in his motel room.

11:49.401 --> 11:52.124
Isn't that exactly what got you
into this mess in the first place?

11:52.224 --> 11:54.357
What are you, the memory police?

11:54.392 --> 11:56.993
Listen. He's only here for one night.

11:57.029 --> 11:58.795
It won't be a problem, okay?

11:58.831 --> 11:59.896
Take it.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.567
Ryan? Oh...

12:05.603 --> 12:07.469
Ryan Davidson?

12:07.504 --> 12:08.904
Is that you?

12:08.940 --> 12:13.675
Oh my goodness. How, after all
these years, we both look so great.

12:13.711 --> 12:15.644
I'm sorry, have we met?

12:15.679 --> 12:17.479
It's a little hard for me
to keep track of all my fans.

12:17.514 --> 12:21.235
Oh. But I was a very special fan.

12:21.235 --> 12:23.401
Yeah, that's what they all think.

12:23.437 --> 12:24.837
Enjoy the show tonight.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.406
I guess slamming his
head against the floor

12:28.442 --> 12:30.242
made him forget about you.

12:30.277 --> 12:32.978
Hey, real quick, can you slam
my head against the floor?

12:33.014 --> 12:34.946
Oh, he remembers me, all right.

12:34.981 --> 12:37.148
Nobody forgets Bonnie Wheeler.

12:37.183 --> 12:39.216
No matter how hard they try.

12:39.252 --> 12:40.785
Hey, Steve.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.054
Can you prep a B-12 shot for me?

12:43.089 --> 12:44.620
I need a little somethin'
extra for the show tonight.

12:45.525 --> 12:49.160
Oh! Tucker. I know how
we can stop the match.

12:49.195 --> 12:51.462
Well, at least how
you can stop the match.

12:51.497 --> 12:53.590
Nope, not doin' it. Don't
even ask. I'm going home.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.693
- Okay, I'll buy you dinner.
- Lobster?

12:54.724 --> 12:55.362
- Pizza.
- Steak?

12:55.462 --> 12:56.528
- Pizza.
- Done.

13:02.369 --> 13:05.470
Aah, I was hopin' for the pizza man.

13:05.506 --> 13:07.739
I wanted to tell you,
Anita just stopped by,

13:07.774 --> 13:10.141
and she didn't even
stay the full 20 minutes.

13:11.411 --> 13:13.344
Not really somethin' to brag about.

13:14.614 --> 13:17.648
Ben, I'm sorry, but this
girl is playing you perfectly.

13:17.684 --> 13:19.450
Mmm, pretty sure someone
who has feelings for me

13:19.485 --> 13:21.519
wouldn't accidentally call me "Bill."

13:23.690 --> 13:25.755
And yet, you seem
oddly obsessed with her.

13:25.855 --> 13:28.188
I'm not obsessed. If
I see her again, great,

13:28.223 --> 13:29.523
if I don't, whatever.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.206
Oh, good! Because if I was her,

13:31.306 --> 13:35.041
and I was, uh, I predict
she's about to go radio silent,

13:35.077 --> 13:38.244
totally unavailable, now
you're the one chasing her,

13:38.280 --> 13:40.546
and that's when she
reels you in like a fish.

13:40.582 --> 13:44.883
No. She'd jump at
the chance to see me again.

13:44.918 --> 13:47.719
"Hey, Anita. Round three tonight?"

13:47.754 --> 13:50.555
Oh! Would you look at that.

13:50.591 --> 13:52.958
It's as if she was
anxiously awaiting my call.

13:53.928 --> 13:56.428
"Sorry, busy."

13:56.463 --> 13:58.830
"Are you sure?

13:58.865 --> 13:59.964
Late is cool."

14:00.000 --> 14:01.062
Mm, not desperate at all.

14:01.162 --> 14:03.996
"Still busy."

14:04.031 --> 14:07.432
"How about tomorrow
night?" Happy face emoji.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.373
Maybe she didn't get it. I'll
send it again, just to be safe.

14:16.409 --> 14:19.310
Oh, you know what? You
have something right here.

14:19.345 --> 14:21.045
Oh, it's a hook.

14:22.448 --> 14:24.381
Oh, man, that's really in there.

14:30.373 --> 14:32.754
It couldn't be simpler. Just tell Ryan

14:32.854 --> 14:34.508
you're ready to give him his B-12 shot.

14:34.543 --> 14:38.078
But shoot him up with this
muscle relaxer instead, okay?

14:38.114 --> 14:41.581
He can't paralyze Danny
if we paralyze him first.

14:41.617 --> 14:43.583
Should I be concerned you were carrying

14:43.619 --> 14:46.487
a vial of muscle relaxer in your purse?

14:49.057 --> 14:52.791
Should I be concerned you
know how to do that so well?

14:52.827 --> 14:55.761
There he is. Okay.

14:55.796 --> 14:57.726
Ry-Ry! What's up, man? I got that, uh,

14:57.826 --> 14:59.625
that, uh, B-12 shot you requested?

14:59.700 --> 15:01.667
Awesome! What happened to Steve?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.812
I... I tied him up
in the trainer's room.

15:06.912 --> 15:08.578
I'm pretending to be a doctor!

15:08.613 --> 15:11.013
You're funnier than Steve.

15:16.988 --> 15:19.856
Sorry, Doc. I'll come back later.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.960
What the hell is the matter with you?

15:24.995 --> 15:26.614
I can't feel the left side of my body.

15:26.714 --> 15:28.181
Ow! That's my right side!

15:28.216 --> 15:30.011
I know! Now quit messing around.

15:30.111 --> 15:31.710
We've gotta go help Danny.

15:32.746 --> 15:34.213
Oh God!

15:35.349 --> 15:38.482
Why does everything always
have to be about you?

15:44.157 --> 15:47.191
Oh, dude, I'm telling you,
she's not texting you back.

15:47.227 --> 15:49.727
Yeah, I got that, 23
unreturned texts ago.

15:49.827 --> 15:51.493
You people ruin everything.

15:51.528 --> 15:53.127
I kept up my end of the bargain,

15:53.163 --> 15:56.697
a relationship with no
commitment, no feelings, no words.

15:56.732 --> 15:58.566
And you know what? The joke's on her.

15:58.601 --> 16:00.734
She slept with me for nothing.

16:00.770 --> 16:01.869
I know that joke.

16:03.739 --> 16:04.872
Oh, my God, that's her.

16:04.907 --> 16:06.874
Her who? The unicorn?

16:06.909 --> 16:08.943
Yeah, like you
didn't see this coming?

16:08.978 --> 16:10.977
Um... no, not really.

16:11.077 --> 16:13.077
I mean, how did she know
you were gonna be here?

16:13.112 --> 16:16.046
Maybe she went through my phone,
or whatever tricks you all use.

16:16.082 --> 16:18.316
Or perhaps it's a coincidence.

16:18.351 --> 16:20.217
And cue the fake date.

16:20.253 --> 16:21.519
Could she be more obvious?

16:21.554 --> 16:24.418
Or... perhaps she's on an actual date.

16:24.518 --> 16:25.884
Don't try and save her now.

16:25.919 --> 16:27.350
If she thinks she can make me care,

16:27.386 --> 16:29.319
then she can think again.

16:29.354 --> 16:32.055
Really? 'Cause you seem like you care.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.157
I don't care.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.754
I don't think this is right.

16:46.371 --> 16:49.839
Listen. Sweetie, honey, I am
begging you, don't do this.

16:49.874 --> 16:51.007
You could get hurt.

16:51.042 --> 16:52.142
You could end your career.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.102
Don't worry, Mom. It's all fake.

17:01.208 --> 17:04.242
Whoa. That hurt more
than I thought it would.

17:07.681 --> 17:10.449
That's because Ryan is
trying to destroy your career.

17:10.483 --> 17:13.484
He blames you for not making the team.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.828
Ow! Uh!

17:14.928 --> 17:15.473
Why?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.660
Because your mother, who
loves you very much...

17:17.694 --> 17:19.095
Aah!

17:20.957 --> 17:23.223
...seduced Ryan the last
night of training camp...

17:25.238 --> 17:26.905
...to make sure that you made the team.

17:26.941 --> 17:29.007
I'm living a lie?

17:35.615 --> 17:39.984
Roundhouse! Roundhouse! Oh,
I meant Danny, not you, Ryan.

17:42.089 --> 17:44.089
Look at her. Thinkin' she's so smart.

17:44.124 --> 17:46.057
Like I'm gonna go over there
and make a scene or somethin'.

17:46.093 --> 17:47.658
I really don't think she
even knows you're here.

17:47.694 --> 17:49.078
Oh, she knows.

17:49.178 --> 17:52.161
She's been makin' me dance, but it's
time this puppet cut the strings.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.121
Aah! Dude! That really hurts!

17:56.221 --> 17:58.155
Just tryin' to make it look real.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.924
Hey, you gotta believe me, I had no idea

17:59.959 --> 18:02.593
she sabotaged your chances
of becoming a Ranger.

18:04.396 --> 18:07.296
- What are you talkin' about?
- That woman who seduced you

18:07.332 --> 18:10.032
the last night at camp,
she did it on purpose.

18:10.068 --> 18:11.896
It's the reason you got cut.

18:11.996 --> 18:13.996
But I'd already been cut
from the team that afternoon.

18:14.032 --> 18:15.899
That's why I didn't come
to the last day of practice.

18:15.934 --> 18:18.435
Really? I made the team fair and square?

18:18.470 --> 18:22.038
- You're not tryin' to hurt me?
- What? No. Why would I do that?

18:22.073 --> 18:23.739
And how'd you know I slept
with someone that night?

18:23.774 --> 18:24.973
And, God, she was easy.

18:25.008 --> 18:27.676
- What?
- Talk about one desperate old broad.

18:27.711 --> 18:30.913
Hey, that desperate old broad is my mom!

18:32.746 --> 18:35.680
Hey, can you hold my head up
so I can see what's going on?

18:39.553 --> 18:42.586
God, try to show some enthusiasm!

18:44.958 --> 18:48.425
Anita! Surprise. I see you're
too busy to answer a text,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.851
but not too busy to follow me
to my brother's wrestling match.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.191
Ben... hi.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.649
This is Jim.

18:54.749 --> 18:56.691
Yeah, yeah, let me guess,
your probably gay, co-worker,

18:56.726 --> 18:58.493
you brought around
just to make me jealous?

18:58.528 --> 19:00.228
Why are you following me?

19:00.263 --> 19:02.464
I'm not following you.
You're following me!

19:02.499 --> 19:04.599
I can't believe that you're
so desperate to get a boyfriend

19:04.634 --> 19:07.068
that you tricked me into believing
that we had something special:

19:07.104 --> 19:09.237
sex without feelings.

19:09.272 --> 19:11.439
That's exactly what
I thought we had, too.

19:11.475 --> 19:12.398
So, you're not...

19:12.424 --> 19:15.300
No, I'm not whatever it
is you think I'm doing.

19:16.545 --> 19:20.013
Oh! Well, then, my bad.

19:20.048 --> 19:23.317
So I'll just leave you alone,
and you can text me whenever.

19:23.352 --> 19:26.086
Yeah, I don't think so,
Mr. Twenty-three Texts.

19:26.122 --> 19:27.671
Let's get out of here.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.958
See? I told you that
unicorns don't exist.

19:34.229 --> 19:37.063
I'd like to start off
by saying I was wrong.

19:37.098 --> 19:38.619
And for the record,
a woman admitting

19:38.719 --> 19:40.934
she was wrong is a
unicorn in itself.

19:45.807 --> 19:48.106
Yes! Get him, Danny!

19:49.810 --> 19:53.045
Yeah! Ha-ha!

19:53.080 --> 19:55.280
Yeah! Yeah!

19:55.316 --> 19:57.950
Oh, my God! Danny, you did it!

19:57.985 --> 20:00.953
Oh God! Oh! I'm so proud of you!

20:00.988 --> 20:03.921
And listen, honey, I am
sorry for sleeping with Ryan.

20:03.957 --> 20:06.023
Oh. It's okay, Mom.

20:06.059 --> 20:10.061
Oddly enough, I appreciate
why you do what you do.

20:10.096 --> 20:11.462
Is Tucker okay?

20:16.077 --> 20:18.464
Have you seen Ben? I
wanted to apologize again.

20:19.749 --> 20:21.116
Yeah, I think he went to bed,

20:21.151 --> 20:23.418
but, um, you can check his room.

20:25.655 --> 20:28.256
I'm fine, by the way.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.060
Knock, knock.

20:41.204 --> 20:42.970
Aw, don't worry, Emma.

20:43.006 --> 20:44.972
Someday you'll get your own room.
