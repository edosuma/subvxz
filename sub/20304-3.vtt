NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.922
MAN: Are you continuing to maintain
you had no knowledge

00:06.006 --> 00:08.299
of officers using the Downtowner Lodge

00:08.383 --> 00:11.720
to sleep, play poker and engage
in sexual liaisons during working hours?

00:11.803 --> 00:14.097
-Correct.
-It's not enough to hang a guy!

00:14.180 --> 00:15.974
I'm not out to hang Lou.

00:16.057 --> 00:20.645
I'm supposed to babysit some movie star
who wants to play cops and robbers.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.690
Is there any particular reason you'd like
to leave your present position?

00:23.773 --> 00:26.776
You're asking me why I'd risk
a substantial raise in salary

00:26.860 --> 00:27.902
to work in the Bahamas?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.988
Jon, Frank Furillo.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.699
<i>Street Dogs, </i>Frank. Jon's new film.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.618
You've got a detective
who puts the squeeze

00:35.869 --> 00:38.079
to 15-year-old prostitutes.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.832
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:43.043
Does anybody know anything
about detectives

00:43.126 --> 00:45.128
sleeping with child prostitutes?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.005
They are probably isolated incidents.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.923
They'll never be able to find me
if you take that phone.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.093
-Who'll never find you?
-My spaceship.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.637
It appears a tumor
the size of a 30-30 shell

00:54.721 --> 00:57.307
has deployed itself
down my right drumstick.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.391
I've got a decision to make.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.810
If it wasn't because of the lousy jacket
I got on account of drinking,

01:00.894 --> 01:02.812
I'd have had that job cold.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.356
Captain, I'd like an assignment
with Detective Belker.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.443
Four whole days giving
some Hollywood dirtbag

01:08.526 --> 01:11.654
-a Girl Scout tour of this precinct?
-Precisely.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.825
Councilman Detweiler, you're under arrest
for driving while intoxicated.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.787
-Goldblume?
-He's the detective

01:18.870 --> 01:20.997
who was bean-bagging that 15-year-old.

01:22.582 --> 01:27.629
(chattering)

01:27.712 --> 01:28.755
May I, Andrew?

01:30.006 --> 01:30.965
Thank you.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.384
Item eight, the new phones.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.304
"Today Hill Street Station will convert

01:36.387 --> 01:39.182
to the new 912 Multiplex
telecommunication system.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.601
This integrated modular exchange

01:41.684 --> 01:44.270
is designed to facilitate the work
of the police officer,

01:44.354 --> 01:48.900
by incorporating frequency multiplexing
and uniselector satellite attenuation

01:48.983 --> 01:52.612
into one comprehensive,
amplitudinous system."

01:53.446 --> 01:55.740
(chuckling)
Personnel are asked to be patient,

01:55.824 --> 01:57.492
as installation will take most of the day.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.409
(groaning)

01:58.493 --> 02:00.787
Please don't use the phones
unless you have to.

02:01.746 --> 02:07.001
Item nine is in regard
to the ongoing torrid climatic conditions.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.380
According to the National Weather Service,
at 3:00 a.m. this morning

02:10.463 --> 02:12.841
a cold front moving down
from the Arctic since Monday

02:12.924 --> 02:15.009
encountered the low pressure gradient

02:15.093 --> 02:18.555
stagnating over this city, and dissipated.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.140
(groans)

02:20.515 --> 02:22.809
There's no immediate change
anticipated in the weather.

02:23.893 --> 02:24.769
PHIL: Please.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.522
Item ten,

02:28.565 --> 02:30.733
is a memo from Captain Furillo.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.529
-Ethnic.
-No, ethics.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.739
PHIL: "Those personnel
under my command are expected

02:36.823 --> 02:39.117
to perform their duties as police officers

02:39.200 --> 02:42.245
in strict obeyance
with the department's code of ethics.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.748
Those who don't can expect
instant suspension

02:45.832 --> 02:48.042
and possible criminal prosecution."

02:48.126 --> 02:51.838
-Oh!
-(murmuring)

02:53.631 --> 02:55.383
For those of you who are blind and deaf,

02:55.466 --> 02:57.927
we are honored to have among
us the gifted thespian

02:58.011 --> 03:01.306
and<i> person du cinema</i>, Jon Gennaro.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.809
(cheers, applause)

03:04.893 --> 03:07.770
Mr. Gennaro is here as our guest
for the next several days,

03:07.854 --> 03:11.274
and is to be extended
every professional courtesy.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.819
And this does not include autograph
hounding, spontaneous auditions

03:14.903 --> 03:19.115
or gazes of a longingly
sexual nature by a female.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.119
-Joe!
-Final item, a personal request.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.579
Which of you would be interested

03:24.662 --> 03:28.291
in attending my seminar at the academy
as a guest lecturer?

03:28.374 --> 03:29.792
-WOMAN: Sorry.
-PHIL: Hm?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.378
Oh, I got a pretty tight schedule.

03:32.462 --> 03:37.675
I believe you will find the experience
to be very, very rewarding.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.974
All right, those, uh--

03:45.058 --> 03:49.187
those volunteering will be excused
from duty for the afternoon.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.939
MAN: Right here.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.107
-Maybe I can fit it in.
-Yeah.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.192
Thank you.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.654
Leave your name with Leo on your way out
and I'll make my choices.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.656
PHIL: All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.950
And, hey,

04:02.450 --> 04:04.702
let's be careful out there.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.957
(chattering)

04:12.293 --> 04:13.419
Anybody know anything

04:13.503 --> 04:16.631
about detectives sleeping
with child prostitutes?

04:19.842 --> 04:23.471
Anybody know anything about officers
dealing stolen goods?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.183
If anything's out of line
in this precinct,

04:27.267 --> 04:28.643
I want to hear about it now.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.271
If anybody suspects anything,
I want to hear it.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.481
FRANK: Check into both charges, Ray.

04:34.399 --> 04:38.027
I want to hear from you before I hear
from Internal Affairs. Howard?

04:39.946 --> 04:40.822
Comments?

04:41.698 --> 04:44.492
I've been talking about something like
this happening for a long time, Frank.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.078
Henry, you've been quiet.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.500
-I'd consider the source, Frank.
-I'd say it's a pretty reliable source.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.837
He was right about Mort Sanders' house.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.799
-He was right about Bob Blaine.
-This is a good precinct, Frank.

05:00.258 --> 05:04.137
Even if what Hogan said did happen,
they are probably isolated incidents.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.765
I won't tolerate any of it, Ray.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.311
If there's even one bad egg up here,
I want him found out and gotten rid of.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.771
All right, let's get some work done.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.575
Frank, I have four weeks'
back vacation on my sheet.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.535
Yes, Howard.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.621
So I'm gonna take a long weekend.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.291
As a matter of fact,
I'm leaving in a few minutes.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.433
-Howard.
-Oh, hello, old sport.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.310
Something more you wanted to say to me?

05:52.810 --> 05:55.646
-I don't think so.
-Look, Howard, the hell with friendships,

05:55.730 --> 05:57.732
-if you know something--
-(sighs)

05:58.608 --> 06:01.778
The medicos did a reconnaissance on me,
Frank.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.988
Medicos?

06:04.072 --> 06:06.449
It appears a tumor
the size of a 30-30 shell

06:06.532 --> 06:09.369
has deployed itself
down my right drumstick.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.496
Until they cut into it,
they won't know whether it's nasty.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.165
Naturally they want to operate right away.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.460
Nothing really to worry about, I suppose.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.088
An old Visigoth like myself,
I'll get through it.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.174
You know Sanders, Frank? South Ferry?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.510
I never met him.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.888
Yeah. He had something like this.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.141
-Turned out benign.
-That's encouraging.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.686
They made him a beautiful artificial limb.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.441
Is there anything I can do, Howard?
Someone you want me to call?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.492
I'm a little afraid, Frank.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.625
(footsteps)

06:57.708 --> 07:00.128
Oh! Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.131
Damn it, man, we're setting policy here.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.218
Judas Priest. I'll be dipped.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.012
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

07:10.096 --> 07:11.806
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

07:11.889 --> 07:15.685
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

07:15.768 --> 07:17.478
(sirens wailing)

07:22.942 --> 07:26.863
(theme music playing)

08:26.005 --> 08:28.633
-Man says he didn't want the job.
-I didn't.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.345
He was just going along on the interview
to humor his partner.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.180
-I was.
-I gotta hand it to you, man.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.266
It's a slick come-on,
playing happy, hard-to-get.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.392
How about you shut up, J.D.?

08:38.476 --> 08:40.019
You don't know
what you're talking about, man.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.312
-Morning, J.D.
-Jon.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.149
Oh, Jon, man, I got a spot
on the dance card for you today.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.151
-LEO: Suspects--
-Subpoenas, J.D.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.612
Move. Move!

08:51.489 --> 08:52.490
Actually, I can't.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.035
Hey, this is an emergency.
Can I get a lineup?

08:56.118 --> 08:59.372
Figuring that Hollywood commando
is gonna make you his next leading lady?

08:59.455 --> 09:02.917
Why don't you do your lounge act for him
so he can see what real talent is?

09:12.301 --> 09:15.221
What are you looking at?
Are you looking at me?

09:16.097 --> 09:19.517
Yeah. Well, I don't want you looking
at me! Look down here.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.687
You see that nail?
I want you to eyeball that nail.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.147
I want you to get your face down there
and tell me if that nail moves.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.275
'Cause if that nail moves
and you don't let me know,

09:27.358 --> 09:29.527
I'm gonna rip your lungs out
through your nose.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.822
-Name.
-Flint.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.995
You, hairball,
you got some interest in this?

09:39.787 --> 09:42.164
Hey, Jon. Jon, my man.
Look, one small favor.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.917
I got an outside line.
Could you make a fast call to my sister?

09:45.001 --> 09:48.629
HENRY: And the maintenance
of that equilibrium is, of course,

09:48.713 --> 09:51.340
-our prime interest here on the Hill.
-Of course.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.676
Anything you can do like that
will help us.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.346
Sorry. Got hung up.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.391
Frank, Katy Bambridge
of the mayor's film board.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.934
-Good to meet you.
-Tom Petowski,

10:02.018 --> 10:03.519
production manager of<i> Street Dogs.</i>

10:03.603 --> 10:04.604
-Good to meet you.
-How are you?

10:05.938 --> 10:09.317
We're just about through.
Mr. Petowski is a realist.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.445
I presume that means he's willing
to talk to the gangs.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.614
I'd like a meeting as soon as possible.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.240
In the meantime, I'd be grateful

10:16.324 --> 10:17.992
for a short course
from Detective Goldblume

10:18.075 --> 10:20.328
on turfs and gang strengths.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.873
That seems to be the only thing about
your city that Ms. Bambridge doesn't know.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.583
(laughs) Faulty education.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.294
Henry?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.339
He's all yours.
Anything else we can do for you?

10:31.797 --> 10:34.342
We'd like to donate $10,000
for a youth project

10:34.425 --> 10:35.635
to be administered by your precinct.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.637
-Maybe we could get the--
-Very generous.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.971
We'll give it some thought.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.683
Well, we won't take
any more of your time then.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.520
Could we get that sit-down
with the gangs this afternoon?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.315
-I'm due back in LA tomorrow.
-Sure.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.028
And, uh, Captain,
you'll keep my star under wraps, okay?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.198
I'll try, Mr. Petowski.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.207
Captain, I'd like an assignment
with Detective Belker.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.959
Mr. Gennaro,
you're already on night ride-alongs.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.419
We've tried to give you a free hand

11:10.503 --> 11:12.755
in observing the day-to-day operations
of this precinct.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.466
-Yeah, but you see--
-That's as far as I'm prepared to go.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.718
Stakeout and plain-clothes operations
are dangerous.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.388
-We'd have no way of protecting you.
-I'll waive personal injury.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.808
I'm also responsible to the people
on the Hill and to my men.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.770
Could I just spend time with him?
I mean, is he always on assignment?

11:29.730 --> 11:31.691
I'll talk to Detective Belker.

11:38.989 --> 11:39.949
Detective?

11:43.285 --> 11:45.955
Mr. Gennaro has made a specific request

11:46.038 --> 11:48.749
that he tour with you
for the next four days.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.377
-(clears throat)
-Captain, please.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.922
I got a meet set up for tomorrow.
Took me two weeks to arrange.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.300
I couldn't be more sympathetic, Mick,
but there's really no point in arguing.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.221
I'm supposed to spend four whole days

12:02.304 --> 12:06.600
giving some Hollywood dirtbag
a Girl Scout tour of this precinct?

12:06.684 --> 12:07.810
Precisely.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.997
Come on, spittoon face.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.208
-How many left?
-Six.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.085
Why'd you get so many witnesses?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.963
-Get off of me, J.D.
-What's that mean?

12:36.046 --> 12:37.840
Means I want you off my back, man.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.216
I've got a decision to make,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.802
and I can't nurse you
through your hurt feelings, man.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.598
Hey, Neal, I'm cool
behind the Bahamas gig.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.892
If it wasn't for my lousy jacket
on account of drinking,

12:47.975 --> 12:49.685
I'd have had the job cold.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.104
Can't see past your nose, can you, J.D.?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.023
It's the Bahamas, you jerk.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.193
The whole security force
is probably gonna be Black, see?

12:57.485 --> 12:59.779
But past that,
I gotta listen to your racist rebop.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.697
Racist?

13:02.656 --> 13:06.994
-You could never be my assistant.
-Hey, Jack, I took a bullet for you once.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.038
Easier than working for me, my man, right?

13:11.081 --> 13:13.751
This job thing's got to you,
hasn't it, Neal?

13:14.376 --> 13:17.505
-You're scared.
-Maybe.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.133
What are you afraid of, man? Success?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.596
-Walk away from me, John.
-Sure.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.352
There's, uh, too much color
in here for my racist taste.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.573
-Dr. Singh?
-Yes?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.450
-This is for you.
-What's this?

13:46.534 --> 13:47.660
Be there.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.747
(speaking foreign language)

13:56.210 --> 13:59.463
And in heat such as this,
it is a commonly known fact

13:59.547 --> 14:01.423
that your basic African type

14:01.507 --> 14:04.260
has a higher thermostat
than your basic Caucasian type.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.887
White people are simply not equipped.

14:06.971 --> 14:10.015
-You got that right.
-Let's not talk about it.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.059
-(tires screech)
-What the hell?

14:14.228 --> 14:18.190
ANDY: You, will you pull your vehicle
off to the right side of this roadway?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.623
(slurring) My license.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.500
I'll hold onto it
while you get out of the car

14:36.584 --> 14:39.044
-and walk a line.
-Look at the name.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.339
Arnold R. Detweiler.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.049
I think I can spell that, pal.
Now get on out of the car.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.887
Officer, don't you know who I am?

14:47.970 --> 14:51.307
You're the man who's gonna take
a sobriety test or go to jail.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.144
-Now get out of the car.
-You stupid jerk.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.353
Hey, hey.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.150
Now, before you get too irrational
about all this,

15:01.233 --> 15:03.777
that is Councilman Detweiler.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.614
-Councilman, huh?
-Yeah. Police Appropriations.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.408
Right.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.412
Councilman Detweiler,

15:13.954 --> 15:16.040
you're under arrest for driving
while intoxicated.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.626
Now, you've got one second
to get out of that car,

15:18.709 --> 15:20.377
or I'm coming in there after you.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.805
Hey, potato head.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.434
Tell your mama I had a great time
last night.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.771
Spin on it, grease ball. I'm here.

15:44.068 --> 15:48.155
Yo, Dudley.
Have you beaten the lice problem yet?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.327
Martinez, party of three.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.289
Yo, Mama. If only I were a bar of soap.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.457
Hey, hey.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.794
DETWEILER:
My lawyers are gonna file suit so fast

16:01.877 --> 16:04.463
it'll make your badge spin,
you low-ranking punk.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.340
Officer, I'm speaking here.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.718
False arrest, defamation of character,

16:10.135 --> 16:11.595
abuse of authority.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.138
By the time I'm through with you,

16:13.222 --> 16:15.849
you'll be walking the graveyard beat
through the projects.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.727
You're gonna walk in here
and you're gonna sit down.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.979
Thought you ought to know, Lieutenant.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.815
-Me and Renko just brought in a 502.
-All right.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.026
Refused a Breathalyzer, scored
about a G-minus on his attitude test,

16:26.110 --> 16:28.362
so we're running him right by the numbers.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.488
Good.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.117
The guy had an obnoxious attitude,
Lieutenant.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.953
Hill, why are you telling me all this?

16:38.372 --> 16:41.458
The man was, uh, Councilman Detweiler.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.005
<i>Madre mía.</i>

16:47.423 --> 16:50.134
FRANK: Arnie Detweiler, just what I need.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.844
Of all the people...

16:53.429 --> 16:55.639
All right, just treat him
like everyone else, Ray.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.100
Phone call, booking, bail, by the numbers.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.685
And pull his file, would you?

16:59.768 --> 17:02.771
My recollection is, this isn't
the first time for the councilman.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.858
Captain, you have a gang meeting
down in Roll Call.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.942
Thanks, Leo.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.242
-Anything else?
-Some of the men heard a rumor.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.410
About Howard.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.963
-He's in the hospital.
-What? The hospital?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.632
He thinks he may have cancer.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.970
Forget it, lady.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.307
Ain't no way you're bringing no Gypsy Boys
up to 10-Deuce and Dekker.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.561
I'm not sure I understand your objections,
Mr. Marcel.

17:42.644 --> 17:47.191
102nd Street and Dekker is Dragon turf,
Miss Bambridge.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.735
I think Mr. Marcel is suggesting--

17:49.818 --> 17:51.737
What I'm suggesting, Miss Lady,

17:51.820 --> 17:53.864
is we will run
this honky flick out of town

17:53.947 --> 17:57.993
before some Gypsy Boy skuzz
gonna make a salary working my turf.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.454
Go suck canal water, Hershey Bar.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.041
-Gypsy Boys got a contract.
-Hey, contract this, son.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.669
-(clamoring)
-FRANK: Gentlemen.

18:09.671 --> 18:10.923
Mr. Petowski.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.426
If I remember correctly,
you have gang scenes

18:14.510 --> 18:16.845
scheduled for Jefferson at Utica Avenue.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.098
Correct, Captain.
It's a three-day night shoot.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.058
Yeah, well, since that's DMZ,

18:21.892 --> 18:25.354
why don't you simply let the Gypsy Boys
work Jefferson,

18:25.604 --> 18:27.898
and transfer the Dekker Avenue shoot?

18:29.024 --> 18:31.401
Sure. It'd be easy to arrange.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.445
-It will be arranged.
-MAN: It better be.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.325
That's fine for the Zimbabwes
and the boat people here, Furillo,

18:38.408 --> 18:40.828
but where does that leave us white folk?

18:41.245 --> 18:44.456
It leaves you white folks
right where you belong.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.001
(sniffs) Sniffing bicycles seats.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.546
(laughter)

18:50.629 --> 18:55.259
(clamoring)

18:55.342 --> 18:56.635
Excuse me, gentlemen.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.680
According to the shooting schedule,
there is a crowd scene--

18:59.763 --> 19:02.307
a three-day crowd scene in Delaware Park,

19:02.391 --> 19:04.643
calling for over 120 gang extras.

19:04.726 --> 19:09.857
Now, what do you say we give that
to the Shamrocks and the Street Lords?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.733
-MAN: What do you say?
-MAN 2: Well, what do you say?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.735
I say we don't work for peanuts,
that's what I say.

19:13.819 --> 19:18.157
You get the standard 72 bucks a day,
meals included.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.202
You'll get time and a half for night work,
and double time for weekends.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.455
A 72 beans a day is standard?
Everybody gets that, right?

19:25.539 --> 19:26.915
-Right.
-Everyone. You got it, man.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.042
-I like that. Sounds good to me.
-(chattering)

19:29.710 --> 19:31.128
I'm holding out...

19:36.592 --> 19:38.302
for a love scene.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.720
(laughter)

19:41.388 --> 19:43.223
With Victoria Principal.

19:43.307 --> 19:47.477
-(laughter)
-JESUS: Yo, Furillo!

19:49.813 --> 19:50.939
Yes, Jesus?

19:51.231 --> 19:53.734
Before we get too ecstatic here,

19:54.234 --> 19:59.615
remember, we're talking about at least
a $10 million picture here.

19:59.907 --> 20:06.038
I mean, 72 bills and chump change
might buy some of these bozos for a day,

20:06.622 --> 20:10.918
but what's the neighborhood's cut
besides parking problems?

20:11.668 --> 20:14.421
As with any location filming,
Mr. Martinez,

20:14.504 --> 20:16.548
a considerable piece of the budget

20:16.632 --> 20:19.343
-filters down to the community.
-JESUS: Hey!

20:20.552 --> 20:26.350
You save your trickle-down jive
for the movies, Mr. Slick.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.685
You know as well as I

20:28.769 --> 20:31.480
they will be transporting
all those Hollywood heavies

20:31.563 --> 20:34.149
from some cushy hotels downtown.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.527
-(clamoring)
-People around here will be lucky

20:37.611 --> 20:40.447
if they get some doughnut money
out of all of this.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.407
(agreeing)

20:42.491 --> 20:44.117
What we're looking at here

20:44.201 --> 20:49.498
is your classic colonial exploitations
of the natives.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.707
(chattering)

20:50.791 --> 20:54.086
All right, let's go bottom line,
Mr. Martinez.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.296
This is a union film.

20:56.380 --> 21:00.467
I am not going to insult your intelligence
by promising you jobs I can't deliver.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.679
Hey, I understand labor problems.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.223
But Mr. Petowski has authorized me

21:06.306 --> 21:08.850
to guarantee a minimum
of 20 days employment

21:08.934 --> 21:11.979
as extras and technical advisers

21:12.062 --> 21:15.357
to up to 15 members of each
youth organization at this meeting.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.778
-(laughing)
-Do your multiplication, gentlemen,

21:19.861 --> 21:23.490
$72 a day times 20 days,

21:23.573 --> 21:27.911
I'll help you. $1,440.
That's hardly chump change.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.997
(murmuring)

21:30.372 --> 21:33.041
And no withholding.
Isn't that right, Mr. Petowski?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.877
Can't we rely on the good citizenship
of these young men

21:35.961 --> 21:37.587
-to pay their own taxes?
-MAN: Sure you can!

21:37.671 --> 21:39.298
-(chattering)
-MAN: Excuse, man.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.925
And plus we stick it to Uncle Sammy.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.927
-That's right.
-(clamoring_

21:44.011 --> 21:45.262
Hey!

21:46.847 --> 21:50.142
So, do we make a movie, or what?

21:50.475 --> 21:53.437
(laughing, chattering)

21:59.067 --> 22:00.152
This time only.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.739
Councilman Detweiler?

22:05.824 --> 22:09.911
I just got the chief's patented two-minute
tirade on departmental priorities.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.205
Among other things,
he questioned the future

22:12.289 --> 22:13.749
of a certain Italian precinct captain.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.125
Kick him loose, Ray.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.093
-You're free to go now.
-Free to go?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.845
Thank you, Lieutenant.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.306
No hard feelings, Officer.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.850
You were only doing your job.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.819
Captain Furillo.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.447
Mr. Detweiler.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.116
Our present circumstances
excepted, Captain,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.787
I do appreciate your guys out there
enforcing the laws,

22:51.870 --> 22:53.497
zealous as they may be.

22:54.956 --> 22:57.042
Anyway, I wanted to tell you

22:57.125 --> 22:59.169
that I will continue
to support you in the council,

22:59.252 --> 23:02.047
and I don't take the least offense.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.633
-You don't take offense?
-Nah.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.010
Need I remind you, Councilman,

23:07.344 --> 23:09.805
that you were driving a vehicle
under the influence?

23:09.888 --> 23:11.098
I have your sheet here.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.642
You have been detained
no fewer than six times

23:13.725 --> 23:15.352
in the past three years
for the same offense,

23:15.435 --> 23:18.021
-two of those involving accidents.
-Enough, Captain.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.565
I just got an earful from the chief
five minutes ago,

23:20.649 --> 23:23.860
so we're gonna kick you loose on this one,
but you'd better believe me,

23:24.361 --> 23:27.948
one more time and I don't give a damn
if the governor himself phones.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.658
I'm pushing you straight
through the system.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.702
-Are you just hold on one--
-I mean it. You're a dangerous man.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.121
You bet I am, Furillo.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.707
You don't ever want to find out
just how dangerous.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.001
Hey, Captain.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.713
I don't know what went down just now,

23:43.797 --> 23:46.341
but that bust was by the numbers,
and councilman or not--

23:46.425 --> 23:49.219
-Forget about it.
-Forget about it?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.180
Well, maybe I should
just forget about the memo

23:52.264 --> 23:53.890
you put out this morning, too.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.809
"Strict obedience."

23:55.892 --> 23:58.103
Departmental codes. Ethics by the book.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.730
Grow up, Hill. We lost one.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.066
It isn't the first time
and it won't be the last,

24:03.150 --> 24:04.317
so let's get some work done.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.289
Right over here.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.169
That's it, 402.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.087
What's the beef?

24:25.130 --> 24:26.381
Ask him. He'll tell you.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.967
The guy's 18 weeks delinquent
on his phone bill.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.553
I gotta take it out. He says I can't.

24:31.636 --> 24:35.223
He says I go through the door and boom,
he'll bust me with a ball bat.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.226
Why don't you just wait
until he ain't home?

24:38.852 --> 24:40.061
The guy's a weirdo.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.731
He never leaves his room
until the middle of the night,

24:42.814 --> 24:46.318
and then he goes out back
and he goes through the garbage.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.821
I've been here six times.
Today I get the unit.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.115
-Okay. What's his name?
-BOTH: Smith.

24:53.700 --> 24:57.204
Mr. Smith? Police here. Hill Street.
Please open up the door.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.998
There's no power on this planet
that can open that door.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.459
-(mumbles)
-You have a key?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.961
It's unlocked. He's barricaded it.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.384
(grunts)

25:15.222 --> 25:16.473
The barrier's been broken.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.226
Yes, there's two of them.
They're coming in now.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.977
One's very tall,

25:21.061 --> 25:23.730
with a kind of a militaristic-looking
emblem on his headgear.

25:23.813 --> 25:27.776
The other's a woman. Type seven, I'd say.
They're moving closer.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.070
I don't know how much longer
I can just keep on talking like this.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.696
Please! Get word to Nevil.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.032
Tell him I'll hold out as long as I can.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.743
I salute the vector bosoms of my mother.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.248
Uh, look, Mr. Smith.
We've come to get the telephone.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.501
-Could you just, uh, tell us where it is?
-SMITH: You'll never find it.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.879
See, I... I dropped it in a time warp

25:48.296 --> 25:51.424
-between 1771 and 4 A.D.
-Here it is.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.594
-Don't touch that phone!
-Hey! No! That's enough.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.515
See, they'll... they'll never be able
to find me if you take that phone.

25:58.598 --> 25:59.891
LUCY: Who'll never find you?

26:00.850 --> 26:05.730
Well, my spaceship was damaged and, uh,

26:05.814 --> 26:08.149
so they had to leave some weight behind.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.151
I volunteered.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.779
"We'll come back for you," they said.

26:13.238 --> 26:17.993
"We'll fix the ship and recross
a half a million light years of space,

26:18.076 --> 26:20.704
and then we'll beam you up
through the atmosphere."

26:20.787 --> 26:23.665
(chuckles) "But we'll call first," see?

26:23.748 --> 26:26.293
I've been stranded on
this spot for 10,000 years,

26:26.376 --> 26:29.504
but today's the day. (laughs)

26:29.588 --> 26:33.091
The rescue expedition is due to arrive
and take me home.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.761
But they can't find me
if I don't have a telephone.

26:36.845 --> 26:37.804
Ain't even connected.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.140
I'm begging you.

26:40.557 --> 26:44.561
Don't take my phone.
I'm... I'm lost without it.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.402
Now I'm lost in space!

26:58.074 --> 26:59.743
(sobbing)

27:09.169 --> 27:11.004
You're still thinking about Lou Hogan?

27:12.380 --> 27:15.634
There hasn't been an hour in the last 18
when I haven't thought about it.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.219
Is that why you were pacing last night?

27:19.512 --> 27:20.722
I owe you one.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.061
You know I was the moving force
behind the guilty decision

27:26.144 --> 27:27.395
in the Board of Rights.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.941
If you had to do it all over again,
would you vote any differently?

27:32.025 --> 27:32.984
No.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.445
But I can't help questioning the process.

27:36.404 --> 27:39.199
We handled the entire matter
so bureaucratically.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.994
Motions, testimony,
transcripts, decisions.

27:45.288 --> 27:49.292
We managed to overlook only one thing,
the human being at the center of it all.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.130
I just know there was something more
I could have done for him, Joyce.

27:54.673 --> 27:58.218
-I'm gonna regret not finding it.
-It's my turn, remember?

27:58.843 --> 28:01.096
-I didn't know you had a charge here.
-I don't.

28:01.888 --> 28:02.931
I took a room.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.019
-Is that right?
-Mm.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.231
Care to murder a half hour, Captain?

28:14.234 --> 28:15.694
I'd like that very much.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.835
-JON: Come on, Belker. Lighten up.
-MICK: I'll tell you this, hair ball.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.379
I got stuff took me two weeks to set up.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.673
Tomorrow you find
yourself a new babysitter.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.425
Would you at least help me today?

28:39.092 --> 28:42.137
Look, besides the fact that you're keeping
me from doing my work,

28:42.220 --> 28:44.806
I don't like the way guys like you play
guys like me in the movies.

28:44.889 --> 28:48.351
-You know? Ain't real.
-I'd like to find out what is.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.771
Why? They'll probably change it anyway.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.648
Listen, I'll bet some of your best work

28:53.732 --> 28:56.067
was loused up later on by prosecutors
and judges, right?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.944
But does that stop you from trying? No.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.615
Look at your feet.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.120
-So what about 'em?
-What are you wearing, you jerk?

29:07.203 --> 29:08.747
-Sneakers. I figured--
-That's not sneakers.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.206
That's $80 jogging shoes.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.460
Where the hell are you gonna find $80
jogging shoes here on the Hill?

29:14.169 --> 29:16.629
You'd be made undercover by every hype
on Dekker Avenue.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.466
Besides which,
that crap's got no lateral support.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.092
So where can I get the kind like yours?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.303
You go to Rosniak Supply.

29:23.386 --> 29:26.306
You ask Monty for the high black tops
by Comet.

29:26.389 --> 29:27.849
Local sleaze call 'em felony flyers.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.059
-How do you spell it? How do you spell it?
-Rosniak.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.437
I... I don't know how to spell it.

29:35.231 --> 29:39.194
-Can we talk some about stakeouts?
-(sighs) What kind?

29:39.694 --> 29:42.280
I do one in a car outside a drug store.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.824
All right, when you're working alone
in a parked vehicle,

29:44.908 --> 29:46.785
you always want to sit
on the passenger side.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.204
Makes everybody think you're waiting
for the driver.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.040
That's great.
All right, great. What about...

29:52.123 --> 29:54.959
-What about if I had to do one right here?
-Long-term alley job.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.711
You wanna bring along a broom

29:56.795 --> 29:59.631
or a bottle of rotgut
to share with the winos.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.257
You don't want to make it look
like you're standing around

30:01.341 --> 30:02.801
with your thumb up your nose.

30:03.176 --> 30:06.137
And you never want to hang out too long
near these heating vents.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.224
-How come?
-Makes you dizzy. Sleepy.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.059
(giggles)

30:12.644 --> 30:14.521
Hey, Leo told me once you spent two weeks

30:14.604 --> 30:17.190
in a Salvation Army collection bin
on a dope stakeout.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.650
That's how long the bust took.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.696
You would not believe some of the things
people throw into those things.

30:24.447 --> 30:27.867
-Where do you keep your gun?
-That's none of your business.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.497
-NEAL: Got the subpoena?
-J.D.: I'll serve it.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.708
What do you think, I don't know how
to serve a subpoena?

30:39.420 --> 30:40.255
MAN: Who's there?

30:40.338 --> 30:43.967
Uh, it's Detectives LaRue and Washington,
Hill Street Station.

30:44.050 --> 30:47.595
Could you come to the door for a minute,
please, Mr. Redding?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.138
It's open. Come on in.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.984
(gunshot)

31:01.067 --> 31:03.361
-Hold it!
-Get him!

31:03.444 --> 31:05.238
(groans)

31:06.447 --> 31:07.740
-Got him?
-I got him.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.954
Oh, man. (laughs)

31:13.037 --> 31:15.206
Look at all this powdered sugar here.

31:15.623 --> 31:18.251
What were you doing, my man?
Baking a cake?

31:18.751 --> 31:20.545
You stupid jerk.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.964
We were just serving a subpoena.

31:23.047 --> 31:26.301
(both shouting)

31:26.384 --> 31:28.219
Hey, hey, hey!

31:29.429 --> 31:32.557
-He tried to kill me. He's a maniac.
-I swear to you.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.101
Just leave me alone for a few more hours,
and I'll be gone.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.769
-They're coming.
-JOE: What happened?

31:36.853 --> 31:39.272
He ripped the phone out of the wall!
I tried to stop him.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.440
He hit me over the head with it.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.192
-I want this goofball arrested.
-All right.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.778
Look, Mr. Smith,
you're gonna have to put down the phone

31:45.862 --> 31:46.863
and come with us.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.159
Nevil! Help me! Oh, I know, I know,
you can't hear me.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.161
But maybe someday
you can pick up the waves

31:53.244 --> 31:55.997
of this loathsome planet. No!

31:56.080 --> 31:57.081
All right, all right.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.335
Whoa, whoa.
Okay. Joe, you're not doing it right.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.420
I left the Howitzer in the car.

32:03.087 --> 32:07.550
Smith, where's the spaceship gonna land?
Huh? There's no room in here.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.637
Well, if you'd been listening to me,
you'd know.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.014
They're beaming me aboard.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.310
-Through the ceiling?
-Through anything.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.646
Beams are highly utilitarian.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.274
Think they could beam you aboard
with handcuffs on?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.944
-Bet they couldn't.
-(chuckles)

32:26.778 --> 32:30.239
-Of course they could.
-Oh, yeah? Prove it.

32:43.836 --> 32:44.837
Great.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.634
-Real good.
-(laughs)

32:51.886 --> 32:52.762
Let's go.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.306
-It's all right.
-It's gonna be all right.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.350
Easy.

32:57.892 --> 33:00.645
Okay, here we go. On a walk.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.776
-Come on. You want an ice?
-Not for me.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.820
-Come on, I'm treating.
-I don't want any.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.738
One cherry ice, please.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.908
-Can I ask you a personal question?
-Nope.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.577
What's it about? Women or something?

33:16.661 --> 33:17.954
-No.
-What?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.749
How come you get off on biting people?

33:22.166 --> 33:24.752
What, do you want a ruptured kidney,
nose bag?

33:24.836 --> 33:28.006
I don't get off on it.
It's a situational response.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.427
See that guy?

33:34.012 --> 33:36.014
-Yeah.
-What do you make of him?

33:38.099 --> 33:40.601
Mid-20s, lives alone,

33:41.686 --> 33:44.480
maybe works in a library and,
uh, I don't know.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.276
Busted him two years ago for rape-assault.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.902
Get out of here. Come on.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.030
-Gotta read the street, hair bag.
-No way.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.948
-The guy looks like a school--
-Read the street. Now.

33:54.032 --> 33:54.907
JON: Huh?

33:54.991 --> 33:57.452
It's 102 degrees, and he's wearing a coat.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.538
-(glass shatters)
-(woman screams)

34:02.248 --> 34:03.791
WOMAN: Help! Help!

34:03.875 --> 34:05.626
(snarling)

34:07.587 --> 34:10.882
WOMAN: Help! Help! Somebody help!

34:11.466 --> 34:14.635
Get up, man, get up. Go ahead. Come on!

34:14.719 --> 34:18.765
(shouting)

34:18.848 --> 34:20.683
Get off him. Get off!

34:32.487 --> 34:35.531
You're under arrest, hair ball. Get up!

34:36.699 --> 34:39.285
Now, move! Move!

34:39.368 --> 34:41.245
(sirens blaring)

34:43.331 --> 34:45.208
You're Jon Gennaro.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.424
Damn it, Mick.

34:53.508 --> 34:54.592
I got a million questions racing
around my mind.

34:54.675 --> 34:55.593
Aw, come on, kid.

34:55.676 --> 34:58.387
I got a lot of paperwork here,
and it's all part of this bust.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.890
All right, let's have dinner tonight.
What do you say?

35:02.391 --> 35:03.810
-I don't know.
-Come on, come on.

35:03.893 --> 35:04.727
What do you say? Please?

35:04.811 --> 35:06.479
All right,
I'll think about it. I'll think about it.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.898
Now will you please back off
and give me some room?

35:11.025 --> 35:14.403
-I get a phone call, don't I?
-One 10-cent call. That's it.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.656
And no intergalactic area codes, okay?

35:16.739 --> 35:19.033
He ain't calling his mom right now.
The phones are down.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.701
-What do you mean?
-Joe.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.620
There's a million miles
of space out there.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.039
How do you think they're gonna find me?
You think they're mind readers?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.916
Where'd you get this? This is an R-19.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.709
They haven't made these
since before the war.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.713
-(rings)
-That's for me! Yeah?

35:33.548 --> 35:34.966
(laughs) Yeah.

35:35.716 --> 35:36.843
Got ya.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.929
There's nothing you can do
to prevent it now.

35:40.596 --> 35:41.681
I'm their next stop.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.688
Uh, you two want to escort Mr. Smith
down to B level launching pad?

35:54.861 --> 35:56.946
Fay, I thought we went
over this yesterday,

35:57.029 --> 36:00.074
about you're not coming up here
without legitimate business.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.244
First of all, I have been trying to call
you all afternoon,

36:03.327 --> 36:06.372
and a recorded message
says your phone's disconnected.

36:06.455 --> 36:10.668
And second of all,
I am here on legitimate business.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.629
My official police press pass.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.716
I'm the new crime reporter
for the<i> Eastside Weekly Advertiser.</i>

36:16.799 --> 36:19.177
The what? What kind of paper is that?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.180
Fay, you don't have any training
to be a crime reporter.

36:22.263 --> 36:26.392
Excuse me? Not only did I take
journalism courses in college,

36:26.475 --> 36:30.146
I put in 12 years of postgraduate work
sleeping with a cop.

36:30.229 --> 36:33.649
So don't tell me I don't know the joys,
the sorrows, the mean streets.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.444
-Fay.
-Mainly I answered an ad.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.821
My boss, He's a real nice guy, Frank.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.698
Now, there's not a lot of money
to start with.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.825
It's on an article-by-article basis.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.077
But I think it's a great opportunity
for me.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.622
I admire your initiative, Fay,

36:47.705 --> 36:50.499
but how in the world did you get
a press pass based on that?

36:50.583 --> 36:52.335
What do you mean, based on that?

36:53.294 --> 36:55.880
Essentially, you're a stringer
for a supermarket tabloid.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.341
-Come on, how'd you get it?
-Uh...

36:58.716 --> 37:01.886
a reporter never reveals
her sources, Frank.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.599
-It can't be.
-What can't be?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.269
Is that Jon Gennaro?

37:12.146 --> 37:14.774
-Yes, it is.
-I don't believe it.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.361
-Want to meet him?
-Oh, would I.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.283
-Hey, Neal, wait a second.
-Washington.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.495
You got a minute, man?

37:28.412 --> 37:30.623
-(sighs)
-I, uh...

37:31.582 --> 37:34.710
I want to apologize, I guess,
about the last couple of days.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.422
The whole job thing, man.
What a turnaround, huh?

37:38.714 --> 37:41.634
It kind of knocked
my metabolism off a couple beats.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.969
Okay. No problem.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.933
So, uh, what are you gonna do?

37:50.309 --> 37:51.269
I don't know.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.981
Man, it's none of my business,

37:55.064 --> 37:58.359
but an opportunity like this does not
come down the pike every day.

37:58.442 --> 38:01.320
You're looking at 50K a year,
perks up the wazoo,

38:01.404 --> 38:03.864
more native booty than any one man
could handle.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.368
Hey, it's something to think about,
that's all.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.038
Hey, look, J.D., I never wanted the job
in the first place, man.

38:11.580 --> 38:14.834
It was your fantasy, not mine.
I wasn't looking to change.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.919
So I'll think about it.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.506
-But you gotta give me some room, babe.
-Okay.

38:21.590 --> 38:25.594
I just want you to know, whatever you do,
I'm there for you.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.850
All right? I'll carry your bags, man,
if that's what you want.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.020
(laughs) Yeah.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.817
JON: I'm tied up right now, Mrs. Furillo,

38:39.900 --> 38:41.902
but why don't we set aside
a half hour tomorrow?

38:41.986 --> 38:43.070
We'll do it then.

38:43.362 --> 38:46.741
-I'd be most grateful, Mr. Gennaro.
-Jon.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.580
Jon? Shall I come to your hotel?

38:58.377 --> 38:59.795
Great phone system, Frank.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.881
Been trying to get you
on the horn for two hours.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.841
Detweiler's gone, so what's the problem?

39:03.924 --> 39:07.261
What's the problem?
Frank, are you losing it up here?

39:07.720 --> 39:10.181
First you go on some
holier-than-the-rest-of-us crusade

39:10.264 --> 39:13.934
and Lou Hogan blows his brains out
all over half the newsprint in town.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.728
Don't lay that one on me.

39:15.811 --> 39:19.231
And not 12 hours later
you haul in Arnie Detweiler.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.610
Now I learn, apropos the Hogan situation,

39:22.693 --> 39:26.238
that there was something aromatic
in those charges he was spraying.

39:26.822 --> 39:29.784
Frank,
my political bacon's in the fire here.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.370
I am not gonna wear brown
earmuffs on this one.

39:32.745 --> 39:36.165
-What are you talking about?
-I am talking about Henry Goldstein.

39:37.291 --> 39:40.127
-Goldblume.
-Goldblume, Goldstein. Whatever.

39:40.836 --> 39:43.631
He's the detective who was bean bagging
that 15-year-old.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.635
Henry Goldblume? That's crazy.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.720
-That's a mistake.
-It's not a mistake.

39:49.804 --> 39:53.391
You talk to Ralph MacArthur,
one of Lou Hogan's guys from the Heights.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.518
He and his partner arrested her twice.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.813
Said that Goldblume bedded her
instead of busting her,

39:58.896 --> 40:01.065
then kept her in his apartment.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.235
That's statutory rape, for openers, Frank.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.152
I don't believe it.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.030
-Get rid of him.
-I'm not doing anything

40:08.114 --> 40:11.826
until after I've conducted my own
very thorough investigation.

40:12.284 --> 40:14.245
It's open season on cops, Frank.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.705
The girl is due in court next Thursday.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.125
You do whatever you need to do,

40:19.959 --> 40:21.127
but you get rid of him.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.838
Ah. Car's waiting.

40:25.464 --> 40:29.468
Oh, just so you know,
I legitimated your ex-tuna today.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.764
-You legitimated my ex-tuna?
-Your wife.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.016
She came in right after
our Detweiler conversation,

40:36.100 --> 40:38.436
waving some half-baked
shopping mall handout,

40:38.519 --> 40:41.105
demanding a press pass,
of all the damn things.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.815
I figured I owed you one.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.279
Don't ever say I didn't do
anything for you, Frank.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.787
Hmm.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.751
Henry?

41:03.461 --> 41:04.795
My office.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.182
And her name was Diane Koslo.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.768
She talked about her homelife.
If half of it was true, you'd want to die.

41:20.186 --> 41:25.941
She was two days off the bus,
and she was a lonely,

41:26.609 --> 41:27.568
frightened,

41:28.819 --> 41:31.780
hungry 15-year-old kid,
and I took her home.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.327
And?

41:40.414 --> 41:42.416
And she slept on the couch.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.379
You took her all the way home
so she could sleep on the couch?

41:48.339 --> 41:49.632
The whole thing
was a judgment call, Frank.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.218
First thing I thought is why bust
a 15-year-old newcomer?

41:52.301 --> 41:55.513
All she could learn in juvie is the names
of pimps and the best corners.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.431
She had a shot at getting out.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.101
I'm just sorry it looks
like she didn't make it.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.354
Why didn't you tell me this this morning?

42:03.938 --> 42:06.190
You might have saved
some skin off both our hides.

42:06.774 --> 42:07.733
(sighs)

42:11.695 --> 42:13.781
You know how it is. You hear something.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.450
You want to think it can't be you,
even if maybe you know.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.247
Look, the first think I thought was,
"I'll get her in a halfway house."

42:21.330 --> 42:22.915
Meadow Wood House said in three days,

42:22.998 --> 42:26.252
so I kept her for three days
and then I took her on in.

42:27.294 --> 42:30.089
And when the Jefferson vice cops
called a month later?

42:31.507 --> 42:32.675
I vouched for her.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.888
They asked me if she was my friend.
I said yes.

42:40.015 --> 42:43.435
How could you be so incredibly naive?

42:45.479 --> 42:47.439
You didn't know how
any of this would look?

42:49.400 --> 42:52.570
Is that what it's about, Frank?
Appearances?

42:52.653 --> 42:54.697
Yes, unfortunately, to a degree.

43:06.667 --> 43:09.128
I took in a scared, unhappy human being

43:09.211 --> 43:12.423
who ate me out of house and home
just like a stray dog for three days.

43:12.923 --> 43:16.051
Frank, I always said that if my badge
ever got in the way of my humanity,

43:16.635 --> 43:18.095
I'd get rid of the badge.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.724
Guess I just did.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.440
Save you some trouble
with the chief, anyway.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.318
-Take it back, Henry.
-No, Frank.

43:33.694 --> 43:34.695
No, I can't.

43:44.496 --> 43:46.290
They gave him something to look for.

43:47.124 --> 43:50.628
Joe, I think we got a little problem
downstairs.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.004
What sort of problem?

43:53.505 --> 43:55.841
-You're not gonna believe this.
-What?

43:57.593 --> 43:58.677
He's gone.

44:00.512 --> 44:02.765
He's supposed to be gone.
He's over to County.

44:02.848 --> 44:05.726
Uh-uh. Guy's pink sheet is still here.

44:06.143 --> 44:11.106
See, nobody took him out of his cell,
but he's not in his cell.

44:12.691 --> 44:14.943
Okay, you guys yanking my chain, or what?

44:15.235 --> 44:19.156
Nobody gets in or out of here without me
knowing about it.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.325
Well, he's gotta be somewhere.

44:21.408 --> 44:26.330
If you ask me, it's astral projection
or a time warp.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.125
Maybe reincarnation.

44:32.461 --> 44:35.047
JON: I don't believe it.
A tattoo on his nose?

44:35.130 --> 44:37.675
(giggling)

44:37.758 --> 44:39.510
May I interest you in dessert?

44:39.968 --> 44:42.846
Another bottle of this.
I'm gonna have a cappuccino. Katy?

44:43.263 --> 44:45.140
-Cappuccino sounds great. Thank you.
-Mick?

44:45.224 --> 44:47.643
Uh, could I have a glass of hot water,
please?

44:48.686 --> 44:50.729
-Sir?
-No, that sounds great.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.941
Uh, change my cappuccino
to hot water in a glass.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.485
As you wish, sir.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.030
-So, how was the meal?
-KATY: Three stars.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.616
-Four, counting you.
-Mm-hmm.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.495
Let me tell you something.
See, there's a lot of people in here.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.789
They're staring at me
because I'm a movie star,

45:08.872 --> 45:10.666
but this is the guy
who they should be staring at.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.084
This guy's the star, not me.

45:13.168 --> 45:16.004
I think you're making Detective Belker
uncomfortable, Jon.

45:16.088 --> 45:18.090
Hey, it's true. Mick.

45:18.674 --> 45:21.343
You were unbelievable out there today.
You were incredible.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.846
I mean, you should have seen him.

45:23.929 --> 45:26.181
I'm in shape. I can run,
but this guy's a cat.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.059
I mean, he's like a predator.
The perfect hunter.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.812
He knew the guy's moves
before the guy knew his moves.

45:31.895 --> 45:35.232
I didn't know what the hell
I was watching. A Zen master.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.651
-Excuse me.
-No, come on!

45:38.694 --> 45:39.695
<i>Saluto.</i>

45:40.446 --> 45:42.197
-To my rabbi.
-KATY: What does that mean?

45:43.073 --> 45:47.286
That's when one cop teaches another cop,
which you're not.

45:47.369 --> 45:50.122
JON: I felt like one today, thanks to you.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.417
See, you got to understand.

45:53.500 --> 45:56.670
I have this recurring dream.
I'm outside this house.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.714
It's the middle of the night
and I gotta get inside.

45:58.797 --> 45:59.923
I mean, I'm telling you,
it's life and death.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.093
I gotta get inside,
but there's no windows. There's no doors.

46:03.469 --> 46:05.345
You showed me the windows.
You opened the door.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.055
You let me look inside you.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.142
Man, I tell you,
I feel like I know you for years.

46:11.059 --> 46:13.520
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know me for two days.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.731
Some things you don't
measure in time, Mick.

46:15.814 --> 46:17.441
That's a lot of crap.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.278
Big movie star.

46:21.570 --> 46:24.031
Take a ride in a cop car,
get yourself all pumped up

46:24.114 --> 46:25.407
and you go out and you make your movie,

46:25.491 --> 46:28.952
and then you go back to your big Hollywood
swimming pool, don't you?

46:29.036 --> 46:31.413
I don't have a swimming pool, hair bag.

46:31.914 --> 46:33.624
My life is up there on the Hill.

46:34.249 --> 46:38.086
And you just don't drop in for a few days
and know me.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.303
As dear a man as Henry Goldblume is,

46:46.386 --> 46:49.681
are you going to let your personal
feelings interfere with your job?

46:50.265 --> 46:53.060
I don't know.
I don't have enough facts yet.

46:53.852 --> 46:56.355
But there's a kind of hysteria coming out
of Chief Daniels's office

46:56.438 --> 46:58.607
that I don't want Henry
to become a victim of.

46:59.525 --> 47:02.319
-Though it may be too late already.
-Could be for the best.

47:02.402 --> 47:04.822
He's a fine man,
but maybe he's too sensitive.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.073
Oh? And I'm not?

47:07.533 --> 47:10.744
Are you suggesting Jewish men
are more sensitive than Italian men?

47:12.079 --> 47:14.915
I think Italian men make sensitive waiters

47:15.666 --> 47:17.584
and precinct captains.

47:20.254 --> 47:24.007
But as air conditioner installers,
they leave a lot to be desired.

47:24.716 --> 47:27.886
-You're the one who lost the screws.
-The window will hold it.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.850
-You think?
-Come on.

47:33.642 --> 47:36.353
Just turn it on and come over here
and get cool.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.275
(whirring)

47:43.944 --> 47:45.237
Mm.

47:48.323 --> 47:50.033
Cooler with the lights off.

47:58.250 --> 48:00.460
-Frank?
-Hmm?

48:00.544 --> 48:01.879
Tell the truth.

48:02.462 --> 48:05.257
You think Henry had the hots
for a 15-year-old?

48:05.799 --> 48:07.092
I don't know.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.136
I'll find out tomorrow.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.972
(air conditioner rattling)

48:12.055 --> 48:14.600
-Frank.
-Uh-oh.

48:14.683 --> 48:18.478
(rattling grows louder)

48:18.562 --> 48:19.980
Maybe I better go check it.

48:24.443 --> 48:25.903
(laughing)

48:25.986 --> 48:28.488
-(crashes)
-(groans)

48:29.156 --> 48:30.407
(sighs)

48:31.116 --> 48:34.202
(both laughing)

48:36.204 --> 48:39.207
(closing theme playing)
