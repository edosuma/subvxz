00:13.180 --> 00:14.215
Hi, Sam.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.681
Angela Sullivan with front page.
Nice to meet you in person finally.

00:18.769 --> 00:19.889
Nice to meet you, too.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.224
To start us off,
tell us who you are.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.427
Two, one, two.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.890
One, two.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.393
Hello?

01:12.656 --> 01:15.693
Hi! 'M=... 1'm Jen.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.491
I'm the interior designer, come
about the living room remodel.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.035
- I'm early.
- Hi. Yeah.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.494
=hi. - Hi. I'm Sam.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.291
Hi.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.039
You are nasty pretty.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.171
Excuse me?

01:31.049 --> 01:33.194
When you called the other day on the phone,
I told my dad that you sounded pretty.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.446
And he's like, "how can you tell what
somebody looks like over the phone?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.630
I bet you she's tubby.”

01:36.722 --> 01:40.431
And I was like, "I bet you
she is nasty pretty.”

01:40.517 --> 01:42.678
Me and my dad we bicker, and-

01:44.521 --> 01:46.261
come on... come on inside.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.938
Well, what is all this?

01:49.026 --> 01:50.766
Oh, I'm just... I'm working out.

01:52.863 --> 01:57.232
Yeah. I mean, you've got your
computer, and your punchy thingy.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.075
It's kind of nerdy yet athletic.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.246
Yeah, and... and
it is fairly good.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.382
Well?

02:16.887 --> 02:17.887
Well what?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.377
Do you want to show
me something?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.595
Yeah.

02:24.686 --> 02:30.306
I mean, I'm not that into violence but, um,
the workout obviously keeps you in shape.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.528
Yeah.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.567
Anyways, 'm... i'm=... I'm
just starting to study this guy.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.402
He's a legend. Chuck.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.206
He does this over anda right thing, or
if you land it right on the button,

02:47.292 --> 02:49.103
you know, like knock somebody uncon
oh, what's the button?

02:49.127 --> 02:53.086
The button is a little nerve right
here that's behind your jaw.

02:53.173 --> 02:58.088
If you hit somebody directly on the chin, it
knocks them out unconsciously like you...

02:58.136 --> 02:59.136
Sounds sexy.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.879
Right. What?

03:02.974 --> 03:06.387
Yeah. So, alright,
what he does is... here.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.345
- Stand there for me like this.
- Oh. Hmm.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.439
So,

03:12.359 --> 03:16.853
um, and what it does is... put your hands
up... and he does the series like check

03:16.947 --> 03:19.233
the distance, check the
distance, and then, bam! Oh!

03:19.324 --> 03:24.489
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit! Dad!

03:25.956 --> 03:26.956
Hey!

03:27.833 --> 03:32.748
Oh, gah! Oh, damn, why?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.215
You all right?

03:37.175 --> 03:40.463
I am Sam bransby,
and this is my story.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.638
I'm from Vegas... not that
Vegas... the real Vegas.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.636
Nobody's from Vegas, right?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.683
Who the fuck is from Vegas?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.182
Outside of the stupid fucking
shows, and the shiny strip,

03:51.314 --> 03:53.376
and dudes thinking they're
high rollers for a weekend,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.857
it's the Vegas that
nobody knows about.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.528
It's ugly, like, it's
hot, dry, and ugly.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.490
I have a dead mom from cancer
and a factory-working father.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.159
What's my story?
My story is this.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.195
I have a chip on both shoulders.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.705
First one came when my mom died.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.189
Second one came when my old man's life
savings and pension was embezzled

04:15.213 --> 04:17.329
leaving me to take care of him.

04:17.423 --> 04:22.009
I was gonna wreck every bone in the
bodies of the ceo and coo that did it.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.823
A developing
story late this afternoon.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.305
Police were called to the 500 block
of trailwood drive in summerlin

04:27.392 --> 04:32.432
where two prominent business executives were
found severely beaten and wounded in their car.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.353
But somebody else
got to them first

04:35.233 --> 04:38.225
so I went to work
for that somebody.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.995
Sam, you're sucking
on my thumb again.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.826
Hmm? Um.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.583
Put it back in there.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.585
No, it's wet.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.545
I like it when it's wet.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.468
I want you to meet my dad.

05:51.768 --> 05:57.183
All this talk about your dad is totally
putting the kibosh on my erection.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.935
I'm sorry.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.735
Oh, it's a little bit
of a baby arm.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.404
Ha, ha, ha.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.856
It's a pee boner.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.567
What a dork! Wait!

06:11.746 --> 06:14.032
Is it the pee or me
that's making you hard?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.034
Both.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.285
No, no, it can't be both.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.995
Sure, it can. =no.

06:18.086 --> 06:22.079
Yeah, because... okay, if you weren't
here I would have a pee boner

06:22.173 --> 06:25.290
having sex with you in my mind.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.303
Do you ever think of anybody else when
you... you're doing it in your mind?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.301
Rachael ray.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.928
Wait, wait, wait.
The cooking girl?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.257
Yeah, she's spunky.
=that is weird.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.765
She's spunky, and she could make me a
delicious snack in 30 minutes or less.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.517
Oh, no, ufc Sam.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.641
Come on, tomorrow...
Hey, tomorrow...

06:42.736 --> 06:45.148
My dad's coming back
from the Detroit office today

06:45.238 --> 06:46.774
and so have lunch
with us tomorrow.

06:46.865 --> 06:51.325
You gotta tap. - Hey, hey, hey,
it's... see, I'm... easy, sweetie.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.360
So you're serious
about this, huh?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.032
Yeah.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.456
Just like one of those relationship
stepping stones I guess.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.494
Yeah. - I don't know, it
just seems like very soon.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.454
Soon? It's been seven
months, fucker!

07:04.549 --> 07:05.549
Oh!

07:06.801 --> 07:10.760
The gestation period
for a deer is eight months.

07:13.141 --> 07:13.880
A deer?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.306
Yes.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.055
So our relationship is not
even a full-grown deer yet.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.397
Nice, Sam.

07:25.403 --> 07:29.612
I'm just saying, like, I'm
just nervous about that.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.782
I mean, he's not
even your real dad.

07:36.831 --> 07:40.949
Yeah, well, Mike's
dad to me, okay?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.044
Mike.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.294
I'll buy you some of those little
boy panties that you like,

07:52.389 --> 07:55.131
and I'll touch myself in
front of you if you do it.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.674
Let's call him right now.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.122
I wish you'd call him now, and
get out of the way because...

08:00.146 --> 08:02.228
- No.
- I'm just totally game for that.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.930
But...

08:04.025 --> 08:05.140
Stop. What? Hello.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.896
- Quit.
- No, no, I actually got somebody.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.317
Oh, shit, no! I'm... I'm sorry.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.148
No, I'm already clean.

08:13.243 --> 08:13.857
Sam.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.408
Gra... gracias.

08:15.453 --> 08:19.071
Why do you have a maid service
programmed into your speed dial?

08:19.165 --> 08:22.749
You see, um, this is
really important to me.

08:23.211 --> 08:27.705
Okay? I mean, since
my mom's gone, il-

08:28.425 --> 08:31.212
I used... I'm trying to keep some
semblance of a family together.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.639
Okay.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.592
Alright, yes. I will meet Mike.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.972
- Yes, I will meet Mike. Yes.
- Oh, thank you, baby.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.709
=all right. There.
I love you. I love you.

08:44.733 --> 08:45.813
Yeah.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.265
Pound on that.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.851
I have to work in the
morning though so...

08:49.946 --> 08:53.985
Oh, yeah, what... they... they transferred
you? What are you doing now?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.363
No, no, it's just the same...
It's just boring it shit.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.661
I'm sure it's not boring.
It's probably really cool.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.488
I mean, you're making
so much more money.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.645
What are you doing? - Yeah, yeah, no,
it is. It is. It's actually pretty cool.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.958
The dude, like, we have a head guy and
I'm pretty much like a bike messenger,

09:09.049 --> 09:12.382
but they send us out to do...
To do it work. It's pretty cool.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.801
The head guy or my boss,
he'll give me a call.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.298
Yes, hello.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.973
Is Sam there?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.972
And he just gives me
like a quick rundown

09:23.063 --> 09:25.725
of what the job will be, and
where he's sending me.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.850
Tommy.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.774
How are you? Poor
beavers need to be fed.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.902
Sideways.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.980
That's what I said, sideways.

09:35.075 --> 09:40.945
And the steelers are going to be
playing an excellent game this Sunday.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.039
Do you understand me?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.073
And then he sends
me some paperwork.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.703
You know I bring it to you.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.421
Oh!

09:57.764 --> 10:03.430
And like upfront cash 'cause our pay... you
know, 'cause I... it's a... a 1099 job,

10:03.520 --> 10:05.806
like, I'm an independent
contractor/consultant.

10:06.606 --> 10:12.021
And then from that, I can get a basic idea of
what needs to be done or what the problem is.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.821
When I get there, so I know exactly
what kind of like, you know, geeky,

10:15.907 --> 10:17.772
boring it shit I
need to bring there.

10:18.368 --> 10:24.034
And usually when I get there, it's
like nobody knows why I'm there,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.490
and it's like two cats
fucking in a bag.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.425
Yeah, excuse me, hi.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.973
=hi. - Can I help you?

10:49.274 --> 10:52.516
I'm just here to upgrade
the server upstairs.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.976
Um, 104.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.071
It's=-

10:57.282 --> 10:59.318
- man, I like your frosty tips.
- What server up-

11:01.161 --> 11:02.446
do you?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.870
No. They're fading.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.573
They're actually highlights, but
I'm getting it redone tomorrow.

11:08.626 --> 11:12.995
You should. You should because I think
that they bring out your inner spartan.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.795
Oh, my god.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
Do you?

11:18.887 --> 11:19.887
Spartan?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.014
I'm Josh, by the way.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.213
Yes.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.514
Absolutely, Josh.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.092
Oh...

11:27.562 --> 11:29.143
Oh my goodness.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.390
My flamingoes.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.641
Yay!

11:31.733 --> 11:34.190
- What?
- I ordered two live flamingoes for my-

11:36.321 --> 11:37.321
no.

11:38.406 --> 11:44.618
Oh, shits! Due to another
gang of meerkat slip...

11:49.292 --> 11:53.831
You... you handle the flamingo situation,
I'm gonna go upstairs and find the server.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.417
Everything is gonna be...
Everything is gonna be fine.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.247
I'm probably gonna make noise.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.678
Why?

12:09.604 --> 12:14.268
This dude last week at my first job was,
like, the biggest fucking chauncey.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.194
Can I help you with something?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.864
I'm here to upgrade the server.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.369
I have a work order.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.506
Who the fuck is this kid?

12:41.010 --> 12:41.715
It guy.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.418
I didn't call for an it guy.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.470
Get him out of here, skinny.
I don't have time for this.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.843
Screech, hey, you gotta go.

12:48.935 --> 12:49.970
No.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.015
Did you hear him?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.106
Hmm.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.063
Tiny Tim, do I have to put a
bullet in your ass? Get out.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.148
This is my head.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.234
My ass is down.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.784
Aim==- aim lower.

13:09.956 --> 13:10.956
Funny man.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.869
Whoa, whoa.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.120
Hey, hey, hey.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.120
Jesus Christ!

13:22.510 --> 13:23.510
What are you doing?

13:29.183 --> 13:31.515
Oh! Good show, man.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.058
I put you fucking down, boy.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.477
You're doing incredible, man.

13:34.564 --> 13:38.227
Put him right on the ground.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.524
And why does he have a gun?

13:39.610 --> 13:40.610
What?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.151
Why does he have a gun?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.524
He's my bodyguard.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.564
Well, I'm keeping this.

13:49.579 --> 13:53.538
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look! Look! I
don't want any trouble, all right?

13:53.624 --> 13:54.989
Don't worry. It won't be okay.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.045
Good.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.831
What?

14:00.631 --> 14:01.631
Good?

14:01.716 --> 14:02.546
Yeah.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.669
What? You're right.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.217
Maybe I should just go.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.302
I should just leave.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.886
Good idea.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.927
- Right. I will.
- All right.

14:17.023 --> 14:21.141
But then I just show them why I'm
there, and they figure it out,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.442
and then from that point
on it's pretty much simple.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.739
Is that right?

14:25.782 --> 14:26.782
Fuck you!

14:26.866 --> 14:28.948
I just hook up my laptop
to their system.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.400
Whoa!

14:31.245 --> 14:33.611
Run a diagnostic,
figure out the problem,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.664
and then I just get rid of, you know,
whatever's causing the problem.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.201
Holy shit! You're a bad guy.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.296
Get off.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.421
Get off of me.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.298
You little fuck.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.512
Done.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.660
Wow! Sounds like geeky it shit.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.622
Yeah, yeah, I know,
exactly, you bastard.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.206
Oh, come on! I'm kidding.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.962
I lay my life out on
the line for you...

15:29.053 --> 15:30.197
- I'm sorry.
- What do you do?

15:30.221 --> 15:32.462
- I bet you're amazing.
- I'm pretty badass.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.297
- I've noticed.
- I fuck shit up.

15:38.271 --> 15:43.356
So who were these guys you
would essentially be targeting?

15:44.735 --> 15:47.442
Uh, sometimes CEOs or cfos,

15:47.530 --> 15:50.272
but typically the big-money guys
or what's called placement agents.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.448
Placement agents.

15:52.535 --> 15:56.995
People who place large pension or other
retirement funds with hedge funds or other assets

15:57.081 --> 16:00.039
- to ensure that they grow, correct?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.617
They place them in what's
called alternative assets

16:03.463 --> 16:06.546
which really just means they
have access to the funds.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.375
They can do whatever they want
with them, and then charge a fee.

16:10.470 --> 16:16.761
But it's hard for them to not just skim off
the top of the pot, or shit, take the pot.

16:16.851 --> 16:21.595
The entire state of Kentucky
got theirs taken by somebody.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.556
I'm gonna go 'cause pop
probably wants his breakfast.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.186
Oh, yeah, how's your dad?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.174
- He's all right, I guess.
- You tell him hello for me, okay?

16:30.198 --> 16:31.608
- I will.
- Give him a kiss.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.779
I will give him a kiss.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.027
Cheek or tongue?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.574
Stop.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.743
You want me to tongue
my dad for you? =no.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.320
Both.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.999
All right. Hey,
don't you have to pee?

16:47.381 --> 16:48.871
No, that's weird. It's like

16:50.343 --> 16:51.423
totally gone.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.094
Where does it go?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.468
You are such a dork.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.275
Does it like seep into
my knee or something?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.179
I love you.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.927
I love you, too, donkey.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.932
So, remember, tomorrow lunch.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.469
Yes. Lunch. Big day.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.724
Meet the pops.

17:05.816 --> 17:09.650
All right. Later.
Yeah. I'll call you. Bye.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.729
Hee-ya!

17:21.332 --> 17:22.242
Good morning, pop.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.492
Good morning.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.790
- Mwah!
- What are you doing? Get off me. Jesus!

17:25.877 --> 17:29.041
Easy, that's from Jen. She
says to say hello. =yeah.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.927
Why don't you watch in the big TV? I bought
you the big TV so you can see it better.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.418
You should have her
over more often.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.514
She makes a good
breakfast and on time.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.186
You don't like
company, dickweed.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.309
Up yours.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.811
Up yours.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.028
Hey, pop.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.842
- What?
- Does it hurt when I do this to your arm?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.886
- Yeah, it hurts, bastard ass.
- That hurts your shoulder?

17:57.910 --> 17:58.910
Yes.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.706
Did you order something? =no.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.624
Sure? =no!

18:08.170 --> 18:11.287
You didn't order any,
like, stones or cakes?

18:11.382 --> 18:12.872
No, no, no.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.127
Lug nuts? =no.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.218
Okay.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.721
Mr. bransbury.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.178
Hi.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.681
Bransby. Sure.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.809
What? Hey, paco, Enrique.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.018
That's not their names.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.424
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
I forget their names.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.439
What... what bring...
Why are you guys here?

18:39.076 --> 18:41.032
What? Did I do something wrong?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.365
No.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.618
It's what you don't right.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.373
Come here.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.048
Can you... can you give
us a minute, pop?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.529
=all right. All right.
Just give me a second.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.169
Go. Go watch sugars.

19:01.557 --> 19:06.722
So, go ahead, you guys can
sit down, if you want, or stand.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.348
What the fuck are you eating?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.139
This? Apples and peanut butter.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.880
It's good. It's like two totally different
things going on inside your mouth, you know?

19:14.904 --> 19:18.146
It's... it's seriously good. It's like
a... it's like a mouth amusement park.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.697
Who's that?

19:20.785 --> 19:22.321
Hmm? That's donkey.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.371
My girlfriend.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.243
It's Jen.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.662
You call her donkey?

19:26.749 --> 19:28.114
Yeah.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.493
One time when we were in bed and
we were doing it, she farted,

19:32.588 --> 19:35.000
and we were watching winnie
the pooh at the same time.

19:35.091 --> 19:39.460
She tried to blame the fart on
eeyore, the goddamn donkey, man.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.635
Ha, ha, I totally
knew it's her, duh!

19:47.687 --> 19:52.807
So I wanted to tell you that
you've recovered more funds

19:53.484 --> 19:57.443
in your first job than
any one of our other hits.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.610
Seriously?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.655
Fuck, that is awesome,
man. That is tits.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.762
Seriously, it was so cool, you
guys should have been there.

20:03.786 --> 20:08.120
The first dude, the one bodyguard, the skinny
black guy, I took his gun right from him,

20:08.207 --> 20:09.993
shot him with it as he
was on the ground.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.124
And then onteveros, I put
him in a rear naked choke.

20:12.169 --> 20:16.663
That shit was so deep, dude, I had him in the
whole time while I was doing the transfer.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.610
You know what that is, right? The
neck... you choke and you put...

20:18.634 --> 20:20.590
Yeah. I'm kind of
familiar with that move.

20:22.638 --> 20:27.507
I knew you weren't the typical it guy when
you brought torning soap with the bone.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.928
Over a white card.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.726
Look, bro, I'm telling you, man.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.523
We evolved from
amphibians. All right?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.566
=no, no. We used to have
tails and everything.

20:38.654 --> 20:42.050
No, bro, look, you need to get discovery
channel, okay? Because we come from primates.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.176
Where do you get amphibians?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.886
What are you talking
primates, man, come on.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.150
We come from amphibians.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.163
- We had tails.
- Where the fuck is my white card?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.283
I took it. I needed
one for home.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.019
We breathe through our skin.
You see these little holes.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.783
That's where we breathe through.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.876
People are always
taking my shit.

20:59.967 --> 21:00.967
Yeah.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.333
Totally sorry about that, man.
It was... I lost my temper.

21:04.388 --> 21:08.176
Let's throw something, okay?
You can kill a man? Not an idea.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.093
You've done very
well for us, son.

21:14.732 --> 21:20.227
I... we came to deliver your
balance, and to tell you

21:21.864 --> 21:22.979
that this

21:24.074 --> 21:25.074
is hot a game.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.611
If you slip up, even once,

21:30.623 --> 21:34.957
this whole operation is connected
to us so you have to disappear.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.170
You understand?

21:38.172 --> 21:39.503
- Yeah.
- Connection, bro.

21:40.925 --> 21:41.960
Yeah, I understand.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.000
Yes.

21:44.094 --> 21:49.054
This guy is a real
dickhead, you understand?

21:49.809 --> 21:56.055
He's been stealing auto workers' pension funds
and transferring them into Canadian accounts.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.558
I'his... this is my next job?
This is for me? =mm-hmm.

21:59.652 --> 22:06.569
This fucking guy, he offed his own wife a couple
of years back for asking too many questions.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.694
Oh, shit.

22:07.785 --> 22:08.785
Huh!

22:09.620 --> 22:13.408
This is 187 million.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.864
This is crazy.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.701
What? There's no pictures
though. I need some pictures.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.877
No, you don't... you...
You don't need it, no.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.025
Everything you need for the
wire transfer is right there.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.369
You figure out
when you get there.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.758
I'll have, eh, cotto and chato
to guard the perimeter.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.003
Okay.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.308
So,

22:34.603 --> 22:36.685
ohne, namaste.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.558
No... no mistakes.

22:39.942 --> 22:40.942
Namaste.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.100
Right. No mistakes.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.360
No, no. That but namaste.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.529
Namaste.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.738
Oh! Na... namaste. Namaste.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.118
Oh, I get it. Spiritual.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.578
I mean, you can
go out the front.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.221
You can go out the regular door. You
don't have to go through the window.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.139
Namaste.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.098
Lux.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.233
So you two look finished.

23:28.324 --> 23:32.158
So I will bring you the check,
and you want to take that home?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.450
Oh, no, I'm fine.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.537
Thanks.

23:38.500 --> 23:42.834
So Sam is meeting us
for lunch tomorrow.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.708
I can't have lunch
two days in a row.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.038
Why not?

23:46.133 --> 23:46.997
Too busy.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.423
Too busy?

23:49.595 --> 23:50.595
Dad.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.930
This is... this is really big
what I'm asking here.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.598
This is a good one, huh?

23:57.770 --> 23:58.930
Yeah.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.725
I think he's the one.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.895
The one?

24:03.943 --> 24:04.943
Great.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.799
You know, he just... he got this great promotion
at work. - Promotion, great, that's good.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.484
He's got a new house.
=new house. Good.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.903
He's got this really
huge, dinosaur cock.

24:16.997 --> 24:17.997
Great, great.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.952
And he just loves
to pound my pussy.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.380
What?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.501
Are you sure you don't
want a box for that?

24:29.677 --> 24:31.463
No, I'm... I'm fine. Thanks.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.639
I was just checking
to see if you're listening.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.513
Okay. All right.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.886
Dad! Michael!

24:44.191 --> 24:47.183
Listen, I'm trying to tell you
something really important, okay?

24:47.820 --> 24:51.859
I'm asking you to meet my
possible future husband.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.280
Okay.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.607
Okay? So the least you can
do is give me the time of day.

24:56.161 --> 25:01.201
- Do... do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, I understand, Jennifer.

25:01.291 --> 25:05.159
I mean, you haven't been listening
to a word that I've been saying.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.960
I brought you a box.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.293
Just put the lettuce in the box.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.458
Okay.

25:13.679 --> 25:14.679
Great.

25:15.889 --> 25:16.924
Thanks.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.062
Okay.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.191
I understand, Jennifer.
This is what I'm gonna do.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.898
I'm working from home tomorrow.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.769
I want you to come by 11:30,

25:32.781 --> 25:36.615
and I promise you I will drop
everything to meet that boy.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.401
Thank you, dad.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.104
Hola, Sam.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.096
Those shorts are really cute.

26:08.776 --> 26:09.961
- Quiet.
- I like your man bag.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.145
Yeah.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.444
Go do your thing.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.742
Go put your thing down.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.264
Can I help you?

26:46.563 --> 26:48.645
Oh, I don't have
you on the list.

26:48.732 --> 26:49.847
Who were you sent by?

26:49.942 --> 26:50.942
Onstar.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.438
Onstar? Like in the cars?

26:56.031 --> 26:58.026
Onshore.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.945
Oh, okay. And, uh,
who are you here to see?

27:01.537 --> 27:04.244
Oh, last name is knight.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.696
First name is pinson.

27:06.792 --> 27:07.792
What's your name?

27:07.876 --> 27:08.911
Amber.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.789
Amber! Yes, absolutely.
Nice to meet you.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.871
So what... you work
here in the living room?

27:13.966 --> 27:16.673
Oh, no, I just temp for Mr. knight
when he's working from home, but

27:17.177 --> 27:19.133
my real passion in life is hair.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.006
Right.

long so absolutely.

27:35.237 --> 27:37.899
So, yeah, we have an adult
content download virus.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.009
Oh, I don't need to be knowing all of Mr.
Knight's business like that.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.570
Y'all can find out that
stuff down the hallway.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.904
Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm gonna run a new port
for him so I just gonna make a ton of noise.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.535
Oh, it's okay. I got my iPod.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.742
Oh, nice, yes. Smack

Sorry, you're just awesome.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.072
“Whoa.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.657
That is loud in here.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.866
I think you just
stepped both feet in it.

30:40.714 --> 30:41.954
Ha, ha.

31:19.044 --> 31:24.038

31:26.593 --> 31:30.381

word I say, okay?

31:32.557 --> 31:37.267
First of all, kid, I don't know who the
fuck you are, but you're gonna die.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.558
Second of all,
I don't talk like that.

31:41.483 --> 31:42.483
Okay, okay.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.062

take the rest of the day off?

31:57.666 --> 31:59.156
Oh, okay.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.352

Meet the pops.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.343
I'll call you.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.587
Hee-ya! Hee-ya! Hee-ya!

33:40.685 --> 33:41.970
Nice to meet you.

33:42.062 --> 33:42.847
- Wwhat are you... what are you...
- Get the fuck out of here.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.054
What are you doing? Um...

33:45.607 --> 33:47.598
Beating the piss out
of your stepdad.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.982
Oh, my god.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.112
- Oh, my god.
- I can explain. I can explain.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.690
Sam, why do you have blood
on you? What is going on?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.242
- No, just, it's okay.
- Do you know this kid, Jennifer?

33:59.329 --> 34:00.910
What... shut the fuck up.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.558
Yeah, he's... this...
This is my boyfriend.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.289
It's okay. It's alright.
Just let me explain.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.413
Explain it to the cops,
motherfucker.

34:07.504 --> 34:08.835
Sam, stop. Stop. Just...

34:08.922 --> 34:11.163
1 don't want him to
talk anymore, okay?

34:13.217 --> 34:14.674
This is what you do?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.920
This is your geeky it shit?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.552
This is how you solve all
of your problems, isn't it?

34:21.643 --> 34:24.554
I didn't lie. - You just beat
people up and you... you kill them.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.308
I take back from people
what is not theirs.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.764
It's like Robin hood except
I'm... it's like salmon hood

34:29.859 --> 34:31.128
except I'm not
a fish or anything like that.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.518
I just... this right here

34:35.739 --> 34:38.356
is account 25, 29-

34:38.868 --> 34:41.359
$187 million

34:42.496 --> 34:43.496
that he took.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.081
From workers.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.234
The thing that's gonna be there when they
retire then it's not... it's not there.

34:53.257 --> 34:57.467
And then the workers sit for 18 hours
a day in front of the television

34:57.554 --> 35:01.718
because they're so fucking depressed that
they don't know their ass from their face.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.723
$187 million

35:06.229 --> 35:07.685
so that he can make wives

35:08.106 --> 35:11.815
that ask too many
questions disappear.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.158
Don't believe a thing
he says, Jennifer.

35:22.245 --> 35:25.408
Stop it. - I don't want him
to fucking talk anymore, okay?

35:26.750 --> 35:27.830
Sorry.

35:30.462 --> 35:34.000
So what do we do now?

35:39.387 --> 35:46.509
I just transfer from this account
into my account in my system.

35:46.603 --> 35:47.603
And?

35:49.272 --> 35:51.684
I'd beat him until
he's unrecognizable.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.396
No, I can't... I can't. =yeah.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.978
- No.
- Yes, I have to.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.188
It's my job.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.033
Sam, I can't.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.827
There are people who will make
me disappear if I don't do this.

36:08.416 --> 36:12.329
Sam, I love you, but
please just... just... just go.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.915
You know what? Just go.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.086
I can fix this.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.257
I'll just go talk to them
and you come with me. =no.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.795
Now, you fix this, come on. =no.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.802
No, seriously, I can talk it
over with them. - No, just go.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.760
I'll call you later.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.054
Yeah, call me later.

36:35.318 --> 36:41.564
1 don't want to go out there
without my shirt on, but I will.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.792
Fuckers! Fucking fuck me, man,
leave me in my fucking house.

36:57.882 --> 36:58.621
All right. What?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.298
Lake it easy. =yeah.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.259
Fucking guy.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.133
Let's go, man.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.903
Pop.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.151
Pop. Hmm.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.195
Wake up.

37:26.870 --> 37:27.905
Wake up.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.489
Oh, I messed up.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.829
Oh, boy, I really fucked up.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.795
This thing, it...

37:51.060 --> 37:52.060
This==

37:53.855 --> 37:54.855
I just...

37:56.608 --> 37:57.608
Fuck.

37:59.736 --> 38:00.771
I need you to hide.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.152
- Hide?
- Yeah, I need you to hide.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.399
I don't wanna hide.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.651
And what the hell for?

38:05.742 --> 38:07.448
Come on. Come on.
Can you keep it down?

38:08.745 --> 38:13.205
Come on, pop, please,
okay? It's what I didn't do.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.614
All right.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.789
Jeez.

38:18.463 --> 38:22.752
Please, just, this thing with
getting back the money and...

38:23.968 --> 38:26.550
Well, it went wrong, okay?

38:27.096 --> 38:31.214
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so just get in the box.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.347
In the box?

38:32.435 --> 38:34.596
Yeah, get in... get
in the table box.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.143
Come on.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.438
Poke holes in it like
I'm a hamster?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.731
Yeah, poke holes in it. =shit.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.006
All right. Just sit down
and I'll just put holes in it.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.110
I'm sitting down.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.570
Is that enough? That's enough.

38:49.661 --> 38:50.821
It's enough.

38:50.912 --> 38:51.947
All right.

38:52.038 --> 38:52.743
Jesus.

38:52.831 --> 38:53.866
Scoot over a little bit.

38:55.750 --> 38:56.830
Put your hands up.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.170
All right.

39:01.256 --> 39:02.462
Can you breathe?

39:02.549 --> 39:03.288
I'm in here.

39:03.424 --> 39:07.508
There's a stupid cocksucker!

39:07.595 --> 39:11.258
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.172
You fucking knew.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.411
You fucking knew it was her dad.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.175
You knew it all the time.
We did.

39:16.271 --> 39:20.560
We did, but we needed to test you and
you know what? You failed the test.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.810
You made it personal.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.964
She was standing right there.
Jen was right in front of me.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.507
Like, how am I supposed
to go through with it?

39:26.531 --> 39:27.531
I don't fucking care.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.397
That's not my problem.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.909
You understand? You fuck up.

39:33.913 --> 39:38.031
All right. We need... we need to find... we need
to find some kind of middle ground here, okay?

39:38.126 --> 39:43.291
We need... we need to figure
out some form of homeostasis.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.292
Homeo what?

39:45.383 --> 39:48.529
You know, it's like a property of open
system particularly among living organisms

39:48.553 --> 39:50.418
to regulate the
internal environment,

39:50.513 --> 39:53.505
you know? It's something nice...
A stable constant condition.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.642
With all due respect to science,

40:02.233 --> 40:06.852
I told you if you
fuck up even once,

40:07.363 --> 40:08.728
you have to disappear.

40:11.868 --> 40:12.868
So come on,

40:15.121 --> 40:18.955
let's go bye-bye
in the car, huh?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.916
I'm gonna break your arm. Oh.

40:22.003 --> 40:25.712
Hey, easy. - What
happened to homeostasis?

40:25.798 --> 40:28.335
Oh, yeah,
you're right. You're right.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.426
Pick him up.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.555
You're right. You're right
exactly, okay? Exactly.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.367
We got the same goal here, okay? We
got... we're going for the same thing.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.975
We just need to... we need...
We need to figure this out.

40:39.062 --> 40:44.352
In order for me to sustain my
operation I can't have any mistakes.

40:44.442 --> 40:50.233
Don't you understand? If even
one of these head honchos

40:50.323 --> 40:55.784
identifies us, it's bye-bye
pension recovery force.

40:59.332 --> 41:02.199
Pension recovery force.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.826
That's got a ring to it.

41:04.921 --> 41:05.921
That's nice.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.337
Come on, let's go.

41:10.009 --> 41:10.873
Hi.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.925
=hi. - Hi, I'm Jen.

41:13.012 --> 41:16.004
=-nice to meet you, donkey.
Yeah, it's nice to-wait you...

41:16.099 --> 41:17.964
Oris it Jen, I guess?

41:18.059 --> 41:19.174
You told them?

41:19.268 --> 41:20.704
What? It came out of a
nervous conversation.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.208
I'm sorry about that.
Get out of here.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.263
What do you mean get out of here
you, goof? I just completed that

41:25.358 --> 41:29.897
$187 million transfer that
you requested, you goof.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.447
Thank you.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.009
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

41:34.033 --> 41:38.697
Yeah. And I, uh, disposed of Mr.
Knight for you like you asked.

41:38.788 --> 41:39.823
Good. Great.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.183
Appreciate that.
What? Wait a minute.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.664
What it... what is it that
she is talking about?

41:43.751 --> 41:49.246
Oh, I, well, you... Sam recruited me
as an inside man or woman, you know?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.171
Woman.

41:51.259 --> 41:56.003
And so I have my dad's laptop in here,
and I saved all of his account names,

41:56.097 --> 41:58.759
and numbers, and passwords, and
all those locations and things.

41:58.850 --> 42:02.593
I put them on the desktop, okay?
So you can just take that away.

42:02.687 --> 42:07.021
Yeah, and you know, there is a lot
more than $187 million in there.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.394
I guess you should
have dug a little deeper.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.192
Yeah, dig deeper, deep dickhead.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.384
You know, here, I'm gonna give you this
back because this is... this is real heavy.

42:15.408 --> 42:16.427
- Yes, it is heavy.
- Okay.

42:16.451 --> 42:17.566
It's a heavy gun.

42:17.660 --> 42:18.399
So...

42:18.494 --> 42:19.984
Can I get out now?

42:20.955 --> 42:22.820
Oops, sorry.

42:22.915 --> 42:26.032
Yeah, come on, pop.

42:39.849 --> 42:40.713
Call.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.173
Give me a call.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.224
I have a little
something for you.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.387
Jdd

43:03.206 --> 43:04.992
I talked to your dad today.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.289
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

43:06.375 --> 43:10.243
Kind of smooth things
over as best as I could.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.962
He was just mad about his
shoulder though, but that's okay.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.421
- Good.
- You know, when I talked to him,

43:17.512 --> 43:23.724
I also asked him if I could
give you a real one of these.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.640
So you can always be my donkey.

43:34.362 --> 43:35.647
Hi, burrito.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.478
What are you doing?

43:37.573 --> 43:38.779
Where did you come from?

43:38.866 --> 43:40.322
I got another job for you.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.596
Yeah, another job is great but
this is kind of like bad time.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.407
I'm trying to, like, establish
a little something here.

43:45.498 --> 43:47.614
I know. What did she say?
She hasn't answered yet.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.533
So what's your answer?

43:50.586 --> 43:51.951
- Yes!
- Fuck you.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.582
This is crazy, man.

43:54.674 --> 43:57.040
- Oh, I got bubbles in my nose.
- You got bubbles in.

43:59.262 --> 44:00.672
Bubbles in my nose.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.049
I'm gonna get in with you.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.055
- Get out! No!
- Canl get in?

44:12.275 --> 44:13.890
- Just fuck off me.
- Why?

44:13.985 --> 44:16.665
What the fuck are you doing? Who the
fuck are you? Get the fuck off.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.774
Greatest year to date.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.734
Jdd

44:53.649 --> 44:54.889
All right, pop.

44:56.235 --> 45:00.820
There's these, anda I
got you some fresh j.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.613
You don't take that with that.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.066
Don't wash that down
with that this time, right?

45:07.914 --> 45:09.199
That better not be my brother.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.248
Don't be a dick,
you bastard ass.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.212
I'nat's my brother Ronnie.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.291
Ah, Ronnie.

45:21.385 --> 45:25.378
Ronnie had a little incident with ecstasy,
wasn't a good person to have around

45:25.473 --> 45:27.338
'cause he would call
the cops all the time.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.077
He would call the cops
when the cable went out.

45:29.101 --> 45:30.807
He called the cops
on the toaster once.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.932
Get off him, man.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.892
Cut out the jujutsu crap.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.978
I'll cut it out when he
starts to contribute.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.233
Contribute.

45:43.324 --> 45:44.985
You said contribute twice.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.596
Well, yeah, whatever. What... tell
me that you're not here for money.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.201
I only need $50.

45:49.288 --> 45:50.494
For what?

45:50.581 --> 45:51.696
A new snorkel cap.

45:51.832 --> 45:52.912
He's going to sleep.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.082
Well, you wanna fight, huh?

45:55.169 --> 45:55.999
Yeah, wait.

45:56.087 --> 45:57.327
Knock it off.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.661
Back down.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.420
Sit down!

46:07.515 --> 46:10.382
Guys, guys, what is going on?

46:11.602 --> 46:13.012
Who the hell are these people?

46:18.359 --> 46:19.815
What are you doing with them?

46:22.280 --> 46:24.521
So she stepped in
and said she'd had enough.

46:25.908 --> 46:29.947
She flat-out told them
that I wanted to quit

46:30.913 --> 46:32.619
pension recovery force.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.165
Did you?

46:35.167 --> 46:36.167
Yeah.

46:38.170 --> 46:41.583
Part of me wanted to live a normal life
again, but I was also kind of addicted to it,

46:41.674 --> 46:45.337
kind of like, you know, when soldiers
go to war they hate the war,

46:45.428 --> 46:46.668
but they can't live without it.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.086
Kind of the same thing with me.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.517
Hey, pop, how you doing?

47:04.780 --> 47:08.113
You have some holes
in your game, Sam.

47:08.784 --> 47:11.776
You got a little something on
your chest that read pow-pow.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.575
Don't go out the window.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.785
Don't go out the window.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.996
My name is San tiago.

47:24.508 --> 47:25.918
Hey, relax.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.500
You're not even Mexican.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.460
You're a puerto rican, motherf...

47:31.807 --> 47:32.842
Sorry.

47:34.393 --> 47:36.204
I know what it's like to have
difficulties with your brother.

47:36.228 --> 47:39.345
You hate him but you
need him for your go turn.

47:39.982 --> 47:42.598
Use that, strengthen
your undercarriage.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.777
That makes no sense.

47:51.994 --> 47:56.909
So we're engaged for one month, and
suddenly you're making decisions for me?

47:58.584 --> 48:00.870
I still don't know if I can
live with you doing this.

48:02.755 --> 48:03.961
Jdd

49:07.903 --> 49:10.485
You added a ton
of gates and fences.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.398
I did get him, man!

49:14.493 --> 49:16.779
You are a bulldog.

49:31.177 --> 49:33.293
Sam, meet kj chalk.

49:33.387 --> 49:35.594
We brought him
here to train you.

49:35.681 --> 49:40.015
You almost went down in your last job because
you keep dropping your fucking left.

49:40.102 --> 49:41.512
I like your flat ears.

49:42.563 --> 49:44.428
Oh, 'cause of the
cauliflower thing.

49:44.523 --> 49:46.138
Yeah.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.503
How did you get rid of it? They're
not all thick and bulbous anymore.

49:48.527 --> 49:49.527
Surgery.

49:51.197 --> 49:52.687
Why is he jacking me?

50:06.337 --> 50:10.250
You see this? This
is your next job.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.629
It's a fucking woman?

50:15.930 --> 50:19.093
She inherited her father's
tool and die shop.

50:19.683 --> 50:24.427
Twenty-eight machinists
that think that their pension

50:25.231 --> 50:33.195
is earning 9% but instead she
bought a condo in nice, France

50:33.280 --> 50:41.280
so she could get her fucking pussy get
out ragged up by fucking euro guys, huh?

50:45.251 --> 50:45.956
Alright.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.658
Pause the training session.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.163
I almost got you in the nuts.

50:49.255 --> 50:51.120
I believe it's called
nice, France.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.955
I think it's pronounced hee-say.

50:54.009 --> 50:56.500
Like your sister's
daughter or something.

50:56.595 --> 50:57.710
Nice, France.

50:57.805 --> 51:01.138
With all due respect!
Excuse me, sweetheart...

51:02.142 --> 51:07.102
To geography, suddenly out... out of
the blue why... why is it a problem?

51:07.189 --> 51:09.976
You guys gotta be fucking with
me, huh? It's not about that.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.979
It's just about getting these dudes
back, and getting the money back,

51:13.028 --> 51:15.735
and just doing it old west-style,
and making them understand...

51:15.823 --> 51:18.815
Because that's not the way
I wanted to fucking go down.

51:18.909 --> 51:22.242
What I want is something to do
my way, I do it in my way, no?

51:22.329 --> 51:24.695
How do we work, Sam?
Tell me how we work.

51:24.790 --> 51:26.872
We...

51:26.959 --> 51:30.355
When we work, how do we work? And don't get me
upset, you know, I don't like to get upset.

51:30.379 --> 51:31.789
My blood sugar is low.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.377
I don't have any food
on me right now.

51:36.468 --> 51:40.507
Tell me, what... what do we usually do?
What do we usually do?

51:40.598 --> 51:42.589
We prick your finger
and test your blood.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.048
Right.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.537
- And then... then we do what you say.
- Because you do right.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.222
Right. That's what we do.

52:01.952 --> 52:02.952
You know what?

52:04.204 --> 52:08.573
I think I know someboay
who can help you.

52:10.085 --> 52:12.076
1sk, tsk, tsk, pop, pop.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.175
Get out of here.

52:20.262 --> 52:23.004
Do what I tell you to do.
Come on. Let's go. I got dizzy.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.677
Jdd

53:02.554 --> 53:03.669
Hey.

53:06.892 --> 53:09.224
So why did you
want to meet here?

53:11.021 --> 53:13.637
What's... what's going on and
what... what's with the getup?

53:13.732 --> 53:18.943
And what's this all
about Mr. mohring?

53:19.029 --> 53:22.817
I'm here to do... I need... I
need you to punch a lady.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.819
- Oh, no. No.
- Let's go.

53:27.037 --> 53:28.743
Was that... when did
that clown get here?

53:31.166 --> 53:32.406
He's just a clown.

53:32.501 --> 53:36.494
What is he doing? No, I get it.
=yeah.

53:41.510 --> 53:42.920
Oh!

53:43.011 --> 53:45.969
Oh, my god! What the fuck, Sam?
You fucking punched a clown.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.171
He freaks me out.

53:47.266 --> 53:49.598
- He freaked me out.
- Oh, my god! Are you okay?

53:50.853 --> 53:52.389
Ha, ha, ha.

53:52.479 --> 53:54.515
I get it. Punching the clown.

53:55.691 --> 53:57.181
Well, it's just the proximity.

53:57.276 --> 53:59.337
- I've never been in that proximity.
- Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

53:59.361 --> 54:00.361
Dick.

54:02.072 --> 54:03.653
Dick. He's wearing dick.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.406
- Hey, yeah.
- Oh, god.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.515
Here. What is it? Why do you
have Jessica steinman?

54:10.539 --> 54:14.873
Give me that. - Why do you have that?
Jessica steinman, why do you have that?

54:14.960 --> 54:16.166
Can we just go?

54:16.253 --> 54:19.370
Um, all right.
Here, here, take this.

54:19.923 --> 54:24.713
This is, uh, this is a
grand... a grand for you.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.795
I apologize for jacking you.

54:27.890 --> 54:30.097
You keep that, but I'm gonna
deliver this stuff for you.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.015
Sir, you don't have
to do this for him.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.138
- Yeah.
- You don't have to do any of this.

54:34.229 --> 54:36.641
Done. And done.
We'll take care of this.

54:36.732 --> 54:38.313
I'll take the squeakies.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.765
Squeegees. It's great.

54:39.860 --> 54:40.860
Clown lingo.

54:42.237 --> 54:44.477
Oh, I... I don't know that.
I don't know the clown lingo.

54:46.033 --> 54:48.115
Don't. Not again.

54:49.161 --> 54:54.451
Sam, so you asked me to come
here so that we can talk. - Right.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.532
And then you tell me
you want to punch a lady.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.627
Yeah, no.

54:57.669 --> 54:58.749
Should...

54:58.837 --> 55:02.295
What is going on out
here? Can I help you?

55:03.175 --> 55:05.086
Is that a clown?

55:07.221 --> 55:09.303
Creepy, right? I know.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.505
You're creeping me out.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.807
Oh, no. Here.
This... happy birthday.

55:13.894 --> 55:16.180
I guess that's for
you. He had that.

55:16.271 --> 55:18.728
Turns out I'm not... I'm
the mid messenger here.

55:18.816 --> 55:20.397
I'm here... 1 need
to get in the shop.

55:20.484 --> 55:21.940
I need to get in
the machine shop.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.518
- If I can just...
- Okay. Are you scheduled?

55:24.613 --> 55:25.613
- Yeah.
- All right.

55:25.697 --> 55:27.258
Been scheduled for
three months up there.

55:27.282 --> 55:29.113
Okay.

55:29.201 --> 55:30.907
Come in, I guess.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.950
Just do whatever I say.
Just go with this, okay?

55:47.886 --> 55:55.383
Do you understand singing is very
soothing for this so... so in three, one.

56:02.067 --> 56:04.900
Please, please.

56:04.987 --> 56:06.648
I wanna stay, papi.

56:10.075 --> 56:13.192
I want you to know
that we are with you

56:15.080 --> 56:18.993
most literally in this
room and in life.

56:20.878 --> 56:26.168
You were my father's
mentor back in '75.

56:28.176 --> 56:30.258
Tiny Bob was your father?

56:33.599 --> 56:35.009
Thank you for teaching me.

56:35.100 --> 56:37.216
Now, I can feed my big baby.

56:37.769 --> 56:38.804
Pop-pop.

56:47.571 --> 56:48.571
Si.

56:49.907 --> 56:53.695
I get my height from my mother.

56:55.412 --> 56:59.121
Mr. bransby. I'm Roger,
and I'm here to save the day.

56:59.207 --> 57:00.207
Roger?

57:00.292 --> 57:01.702
Roger.

57:01.793 --> 57:05.957
Roger, that is great salesman
lingo, but I am not a pity case.

57:06.048 --> 57:08.755
Right. Don't... don't do
the salesman line, okay?

57:08.842 --> 57:11.629
Ah, yeah, duly noted.

57:13.013 --> 57:17.006
Mr. bransby, I'm here
to get you back on track.

57:17.100 --> 57:20.263
Whoop, there I go again
with the salesmanship.

57:20.354 --> 57:23.846
Again, I am not a pity case.
Sam is taking care of me.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.752
- I don't want anything.
- No, it's not a pity case.

57:25.776 --> 57:28.438
As part of pension
recovery force,

57:30.739 --> 57:35.108
we feel it's our duty to set up
something stable for your future.

57:35.202 --> 57:38.285
We're gonna be setting up
some annuities for you.

57:38.372 --> 57:42.285
You're gonna have money
from money earning money.

57:43.293 --> 57:47.582
Hey, is there another wordsmith
in the room? Raise your hand.

57:47.673 --> 57:49.755
I'll raise it up one time.

57:49.841 --> 57:51.172
Coming through.

57:52.177 --> 57:53.337
Something happened.

58:01.269 --> 58:02.600
What... what happened?

58:04.606 --> 58:08.519
Well, I fired all the office people because
they were just hideous, hideous people.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.446
Mad.

58:12.572 --> 58:15.655
Uh, so who are you,
and who are you with?

58:16.827 --> 58:20.035
Chuck rabot, c&c specialist, got
a call about a bear being out.

58:20.122 --> 58:22.408
I'm just gonna pop a
new one in there for you.

58:22.457 --> 58:26.416
This is my wife, Amelie poulain,
bring-your-wife-to-workday.

58:27.462 --> 58:29.828
Are you named from
the... the movie?

58:29.923 --> 58:31.003
- Yeah.
- I love France!

58:31.091 --> 58:32.706
Oh, wow, yeah.

58:32.801 --> 58:33.916
Oh, boy.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.378
Oh, wow, no.

58:37.472 --> 58:41.681
It was just a giant,
giant coincidence.

58:41.768 --> 58:45.761
Oh, well, I love, love France.

58:46.481 --> 58:50.770
Yeah, I was gonna relocate there to this
lovely villa in nice and then my father

58:50.861 --> 58:53.443
passed and left me this
god-awful factory to deal with.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.486
Anyways, the workshop
is back here.

58:55.615 --> 58:59.483
Oh, my god! I've been to cannes,
but some people call it con.

58:59.619 --> 59:00.779
But I like to call it cannes.

59:00.829 --> 59:03.787
Anyways, the shop is...

59:03.874 --> 59:05.990
She is gonna realize
that we're not following her

59:06.084 --> 59:08.200
and she's gonna be back
in here in 18 seconds.

59:08.295 --> 59:12.709
It takes me 57 seconds to transfer
all of her embezzled funds

59:12.799 --> 59:14.881
from her account
into my account.

59:14.968 --> 59:16.879
We have two choices
at that point.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.460
She will catch us.

59:19.264 --> 59:20.970
And there are two choices.

59:21.058 --> 59:24.221
Either we get arrested and I go through
a lot of legal stuff and end up

59:24.311 --> 59:25.972
wearing a jumpsuit
for a long time.

59:26.063 --> 59:29.681
=-no. Option b, you punch
her, right in the button,

59:29.775 --> 59:33.609
knock her out and we walk
out of here unscathed. Sam.

59:34.154 --> 59:40.775
Four, three, just be part
of this, two, one.

59:40.869 --> 59:41.699
Oh, shit.

59:41.787 --> 59:42.617
Excuse me.

59:42.704 --> 59:44.240
This is my office.

59:44.831 --> 59:47.163
Hey! Hello! Wrong spot.

59:47.250 --> 59:50.492
- Yeah.
- What... who are you people?

59:51.588 --> 59:54.921
Get... help! Somebody?

59:55.008 --> 59:58.500
- Oh... oh, god.
- Oh, yeah.

59:58.970 --> 59:59.970
Mm... hmm. Sam.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.216
Oh! Oh, my god.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.307
Just be part of this.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:08.847
Just be part of this.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.099
How do you know about this?

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.190
I know where the button is.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:23.154
Come on, baby. Just wake up.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.781
Yeah. I just need to get a sig...

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.453
Yeah. Just call 911
please, or no, no, no.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.497
Just... just help me, please.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.075
What are you guys doing? Is this
something you guys do or what?

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.731
Here's another thousand
if you'll just help me.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.665
A thousand?

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.150
- Yeah, please.
- A thousand dollars?

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:37.710
Please. =shit.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:39.085
Okay?

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:40.713
Again, with the squeegees.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:44.054
=this is... - A thousand bucks!

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.868
Just... are you... just help me
get him out of here, please.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.725
Do you need help tomorrow 'cause
I can call in sick at this job?

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:52.212
No. Just... just right now... right now it
would be great if we can just move him out.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:53.459
All right. Well, I need
you to sign first.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.815
Oh, my god. Just give it...
Give it to me. Fine.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.438
Oh, my god.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.565
I'm available. I'm off...

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.570
Here... here, no,
it's... it's fine. It's fine.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.617
Tuesdays and Thursdays. - Please,
just... just grab a part of him, and...

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.571
Is he dead or... am I
moving a dead guy?

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.161
No, no, no, I... we just have
to get him to somewhere.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.729
- I don't know.
- 'Cause, I mean, I'm not gonna...

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:14.993
Oh, oh god.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.500
Is he... he's dead, ma'am. Um...

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:18.922
Coming through.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.375
Something happened.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.586
What... what happened?

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.201
I... 1... I don't know. He got hit in
the head really hard, and then-

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.137
and his pulse was low and I didn't
want to take him to the hospital.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.311
Right. Right. Right.
But what happened?

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.351
He passes out at the sight
of his own mouth blood.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.853
It's pretty cool.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.651
Christ! Ronnie put something on
his head when they were kids.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:45.817
Ow-wee! Ow-wee!

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:48.493
You know what it means when
your mouth bleeds, don't you?

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.449
It means you have a fly

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.746
living in your jaw.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.211
Can I get out of here?

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:05.590
You know what? I actually
am gonna skedaddle as well.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.806
You mind dropping me off at
the clean needle exchange?

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.475
Talk.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.624
- Oh, I passed out at first.
- You got kicked in the head?

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.668
Yeah, I could have ducked. She got me in the
forehead, and then I did the stiff leg,

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:22.652
stiff arm thing just for like
causel just wanted to watch you,

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:25.655
and make sure that you did
it, and you came through.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.620
She was great. She was
like part of the team now.

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:32.738
Oh!

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.827
It was a ruse?
It was a fucking ruse?

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:42.126
I don't even use the
word ruse or fucking...

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.628
You wanted... you turn me into something
that I don't even know what.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:52.090
Sam, you have been lying to me.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:56.936
With all these... these lies
and lies and lies and you...

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.893
You tricked me.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:06.446
You know after what you did to my dad, you
know, it feels like you just took my heart

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:10.117
and you just attached it to the back
of a couple of tractors, and told them

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.660
to drive in opposite
directions, you know?

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.866
I hate what you are doing.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.120
I'm not hurting innocent people.

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.250
I need you to be
on board with this.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.052
And you made me punch
a woman I don't know.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:36.218
You know, you think it's okay because they're
bad people. What you are doing is wrong.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:40.983
I disagree.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.517
I'm done with this.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.270
I'm done with this.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:47.194
Calm down.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.273
I am done with you.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:01.501
You know, you... you need to
handle your business? Handle it.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:06.624
This girl, she's walking
out, all this information.

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:10.552
The fuck is wrong with
you, you stupid motherfucker?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.839
You know I don't
like to get upset, Sam.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.641
My blood sugar
is high right now.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.344
You fucked this one up,
little motherfucker.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.066
Yeah.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.477
It was your idea.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.396
I don't feel good.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.824
You are gonna give me fucking
diabetes, you know? Fine.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.943
I'm gonna eat something now.

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.767
Oh, hell to the uh.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:10.569
Diantre's ass was
out drinking all day,

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.194
and he thinks he's gonna go out
with his friends again tonight.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.284
Uh=uh.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.015
I hate when Mark does shit like
that, but you know what Mark does?

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:22.658
He drinks and then he has this
amazing idea to go drive somewhere.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:23.958
Brilliant.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.579
Does Sam do shit like that, Jen?

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:29.716
Jen.

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:32.136
Jen.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.469
Earth to zoned-out bitch.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.930
Welcome back, yeah.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:45.935
Yeah, you know, he's... oh,
he's got his vices, yeah, sure.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.152
Sure, yeah.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.634
That's what they call
them these days.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:55.774
So by vices you mean what?

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.369
Yup.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.195
You know what that means.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:03.536
I'm sure he does.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.626
Yeah.

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:07.543
So you know what I did, guys?

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.298
What?

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:16.170
I let him leave, and then I call the
cops, and I reported a drunk driver.

01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.801
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, it happened.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:20.223
And you turned in your man?

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.266
- Hell, yes, I did.
- Did he get caught?

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:25.220
Hell, yes, he did and you know
what? He don't drink no more.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.398
- Oh my.
- Oh, so wait, his drinking got so bad

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.225
that you decided you
were gonna turn him in?

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:37.065
And then, oh, after he got arrested he
just learned his lesson, so to speak?

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.950
Let me tell you
something, little lady.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:43.037
From my life experience,
I have realized

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.667
sometimes you have to
kick a boy in the nuts.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:52.464
And in this case by... and in...

01:06:53.551 --> 01:07:00.639
And in this case the kick in the nuts
was a night in the pokey and a dul.

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.038
Did he find out that you
were the one that turned him in?

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:08.396
Oh, hell no, and even if he does, I mean,
who bailed him out and then tugged him off.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.440
I... he was okay with that?

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.564
Yes, he was okay with that.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.395
There's Monica newlove.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.698
Hands in the middle!
Liquid brunch on three.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.948
- One, two, three, liquid brunch.
- Liquid brunch.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.038
Adjourned.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.291
I can't get this
blood off my shorts.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.750
Try using peanut butter.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.007
Peanut butter? That's brilliant.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.254
Gum in the hair?

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:42.885
Oh, milk, man.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:46.184
Just soak it in milk first and
then you use the cold water, man.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.269
Peanut butter.

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:50.543
You confuse the gum and
the peanut butter. Come on, man.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.711
Why don't we get that
to... why don't we get that to...

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:57.855
You confuse gum
and peanut butter? Big guy.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.069
Same texture.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.952
Sam, what are you doing here?

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.748
I want another job.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.252
No.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.329
We-=... you've been
very busy already.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.255
Now, take a break.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:20.961
We already have one of our herbal double
cheeseburgers taking care of seeds.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.388
Yeah. Go... go home. Relax.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:27.466
Drink some milk or something.

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:28.562
Control.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.017
Remember, I told
you control is good.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:35.942
I just gotta get my mind off donkey,
and all these pent-up-ness.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:38.310
I need to unpent it.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.785
Find me another job.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:47.872
Okay. Breathe.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.537
Breathe in, out.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.166
They're doing it, too,
so it's distracting.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.292
Let me see what I got.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.845
No, that's not gonna work.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.015
It's too much.
You're not ready yet.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.596
Okay. Do you have a suit?

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.098
Alright, so does
this make you feel better?

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.098
Yeah.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.234
Grab a seat.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.988
It's more private here
so we can talk.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.362
Vim-hmm.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.453
Hmm.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:28.657
Ouch.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.658
Um, can you do that
some other time?

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.286
- Yeah, well, I'll get it later.
- Okay.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.743
So continue.

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.791
So this person who I know,

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.386
technically, is breaking the law
by doing something illegal.

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:52.471
He, you know... or she, is hurting
people and stealing from them but...

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:53.724
Okay.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.430
Do I know you,
detective o'Hayes?

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.728
I brought you a box.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.445
Just put the lettuce in the box.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:04.905
Don't think so.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.027
Oh.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:12.490
Okay. Okay. I got something for you. We got
two guys. It's a health care partnership.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:19.372
They wanna buy land, and you're
going to sell them some, Sam, okay?

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:20.734
So just tell me
about this person?

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:23.124
Well... well, hold on.

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:28.217
He's doing it to people
who have also stolen.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.224
The problem is

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:38.808
we have to find out where
they're funneling the money.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.980
Almost. So kind of like
a scissor home?

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.282
Yeah. No. Wait. What...
What's a scissor home?

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:56.496
They take on high risk-premiums, and then
drop them as soon as they get a cold sore.

01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:03.673
So you're going to
squeeze them like, um,

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.429
Like a cold sore.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.472
That's good.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.300
Yeah, that hurts when
you do that, though.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.414
You're not supposed
to squeeze them.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:19.147
No. Wait. What...
Okay, well, never mind.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:27.148
The bottom line is that this person
who I care about is hurting people,

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.947
but they re bad people.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.026
Okay.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.739
And so I'm just trying to figure out if I
could maybe get him arrested or, you know,

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.575
scare him enough just
to get him to stop doing it.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.744
You think you can handle that?

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:43.381
Yes.

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:48.008
- You feel strong, right? You can do it?
- Yes. Yes.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:50.677
Okay. Then you're
ready, no? Hey.

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:58.394
Hey, Sam, be very careful.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:03.141
These guys are big.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.900
Are you going to sleep?

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.822
Yeah, don't worry, baby, yeah.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.571
Yeah, baby.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.870
Okay. Well, first of all, you can't
take the law into your own hands.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.743
It's not the wild west anymore.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.417
Hmm.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:21.955
So you can't give me a name?

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.638
Mm=-mm.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.556
How about at least you
give me your name?

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.059
Yeah, no.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.229
Whoa, sit down.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.434
Just sit down.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:51.815
Yeah, yeah, listen, I mean,
you came here to us.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.533
We're here to help you, right?

01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:02.167
So why don't you just report that crime
that you wanted to report, okay?

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:04.796
I got it.

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.298
Yeah.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.041
You have you ever
had Louisiana fried chicken?

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.147
=no, man.
Hey, tavares, thaddius.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.644
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.318
You remember that bigwig we were
tailing a couple of weeks ago,

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.361
a guy that we thought
killed his wife?

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:35.024
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:38.703
Yeah, well his stepdaughter just came
in here and wanna report a crime.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:40.154
It was very obtuse.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.707
Who was that guy she was
with a couple of days ago?

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.497
Oh, man.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.799
I think it was just some
random guy she was dating.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.406
Oh, you know? I don't
think there was anything there.

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.009
All right. Thanks, fellows.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.940
- All right.
- No problem.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.029
So you turned me in?

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.304
At least you could have
cracked the windows for me.

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:19.489
Your greenhouse affected
the shit out of me.

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:27.168
So you were just gonna
let me turn you in,

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:29.666
you know, instead of just telling
me what you did to my mom?

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.086
Look, you've been holding
me hostage like Dolly parton

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.216
in "9 to 3" trying to
get this shit out of me.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:43.552
I keep telling you, Jen, you
really don't want to know.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.022
Yeah.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:51.518
Ready to turn me in? Yeah, 'cause
I got lawyers, I got money.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:55.947
And this case will circle and
circle and circle and circle,

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.179
and it'll be years before they find out the
gruesome details about what happened...

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:03.162
Oh, what... gruesome details?

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:06.825
Oh, so, that's it?

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:15.215
You know, in the back of my
mind I was... I was just wishing

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:20.387
that you had sent her away, you
know, and that I could go find her.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:21.474
And-

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.763
wow! I guess I'm just naive.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.056
Like I keep saying,

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.898
things got complicated.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.571
- Complicated?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:38.658
Right.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:41.029
- Asshole.
- Aww, shit, aww.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:42.495
Damn.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:14.392
Well, here's the 15,000 acres.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.311
15,000 acres.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.442
Wow! Development, ihaddius.

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.696
We're gonna definitely put
some hew life into this land.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.735
It's all been sucked out.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:28.072
Well, after all, that's what
we do, right? We suck it out.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.497
I'hat was an inside
joke, kid, don't worry about it.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.266
- Inside.
- After all.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.500
That was wild country, right?

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:36.584
Wild country.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.363
Did you guys know that a
squirrel that lives in captivity

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:43.800
lives as long
as 15, to 20 years,

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:48.260
but a squirrel that's in the
wild only lives for one year.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:49.469
Thanks for that.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.834
What are you doing? Dude, what
are you like getting gay on us?

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.894
What? No, no, no.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:59.194
You two remind me of squirrels, you know, so I
just... I'm sorry... I was just stretching.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.737
- A short joke.
- A metaphor.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.031
A short joke.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.553
- I know what.
- Up yours.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.514
Maybe we should keep
you out of the way tavares.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.369
Let's get out of here.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:14.251
Well, what I wanna know is what did you
guys do with the embezzled healthcare fund?

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:16.954
Where's that at? I need to find out that.
Where's that money?

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.880
You, sir, are way out of line.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:22.131
You know what? Yeah, way out of it. Don't
worry about it, it's not your problem.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.825
Yeah, okay, here's what's gonna happen.
You see, I am your bad guy.

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.510
You guys... you do bad things

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.218
and I know about it so I could just
let our wonderful justice system

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.678
kind of handle it over time,
but instead what I'm gonna do

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:35.560
is I'm just gonna put
you both in pain...

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:38.939
Until you
tell me... until you tell me

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:43.523
where the accounts are, where the money's
at, right? I just... but don't worry.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.905
I'm gonna treat you like
normal-sized persons, okay?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:50.159
I'm... I'm gonna make you
feel equal and in pain.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:56.418
Unless, I really hit
like... like down.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.293
Well, how about this, Sam
bransby? You're under arrest.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:01.464
No.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:02.166
Why don't you put your hands up?

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:03.261
No. What?

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.531
You're under arrest.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.045
=all right. - You guys are cops.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.576
You have the
right to remain silent.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.965
Put your hands up where... =no.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.288
What? - Yeah, like I said,
put your hands up right now.

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:13.598
No, no, no, you guys are cops.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.771
You know what? Just put
your hands up. All right?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.849
You're cops.
You're fucking cops.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.399
=-I'hat's right. Let's go, man.

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:24.817
What the fuck?

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.112
Damn trouts! Bullshit.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.204
Come on.

01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:40.830
Where the fuck is the account?

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:44.924
Get off of me.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:48.341
Get him off.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.639
Just let it happen.
Just let it happen.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.220
Jdd

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.969
For a soundbite, tell
the camera where you are now.

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:48.658
Jail.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.984
I'm... I'm in fucking jail.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.533
This... you can't just haul
off and get after people.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.081
This is full-on prison.

01:19:58.168 --> 01:19:59.168
Oj is here.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:00.743
He was here.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.245
He was my mess hall buddy,
kind of a douchebag though.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.626
You know, typically like
black guys are cool.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:08.300
They don't fall into the
douchebag category.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.627
Oj is a douche.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.678
He really is a douche.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.054
Your official charges were
never listed as murder 1.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:19.012
Out of all the people you
killed, how did you even get...

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:22.439
I didn't kill anybody? Did you see me
kill anybody? No, I never killed anybody.

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.482
That's the fun thing
about my case.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:28.604
Yeah. No. They... that was...
That wasn't the point.

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:33.284
The point was to hurt them,
wake up every day with pain.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:37.872
Pain from a bullet in their pelvis, or
in their elbow, or on their shoulder,

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:38.993
and their neck.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.415
Just pain every day.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:44.837
That's what they deserve
for their wrongdoing.

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:48.791
Yeah, but I was never
out to kill anybody.

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:54.255
And you've been granted
parole, released in 90 days.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.850
Yeah, I gave them a shitload
of evidence, good behavior.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.768
Do you feel that
you're rehabilitated?

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:01.644
Yeah.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.142
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.851
Made bad decisions, bad choices
in the past, but not anymore.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:09.781
Thank you, Sam.

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:11.404
That's it.

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:12.777
- Okay.
- I appreciate your time.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.154
I will send you a copy of
the segment when it's done.

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:16.280
Okay.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:20.122
Right. Excuse me.
I'm just gonna...

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.077
Oh, sorry.

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.455
Right here.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.002
That is on.

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:29.048
And let me just...

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.667
All right. That is off.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:33.846
Great.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.175
And the guards have
my equipment bag

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.989
so I'll just get them and then come
grab your mic, and be right back.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.679
Do you stay here or...

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:46.853
No. No. They'll...
They'll come get me.

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:55.741
Am I rehabilitated?

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.659
Jdd

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:52.884
Ronnie.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:01.715
Sorry I turned you in.

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.690
Fucking kidding me?

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:15.983
The whole fucking time.

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.860
Fucking ingrate!

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.819
Take me to the airport.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.240
- Huh?
- Take me to the airport.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:28.538
Open the door.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.088
What the hell did
you do to dad's car?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.886
Fuck.

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:47.519
Where are we going?

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:48.686
The airport.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:49.638
Which one?

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.894
The Reno.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:53.813
Where are you going?

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:54.862
Phuket.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:58.272
What? What the fuck is Phuket?

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.196
I didn't... I didn't
tell you that. Just go.

01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:04.487
Seat belt.

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:14.080
It's a desert road.
Nobody is coming.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:14.959
Okay, man.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.836
Jdd
