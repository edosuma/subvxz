<b>Humanoids from the Deep </ b></b>

02:18.066 --> 02:20.121
Now it's all downhill

02:20.156 --> 02:23.421
given the fact that salmon
almost disappeared.

02:23.956 --> 02:25.794
I'm glad...

02:26.197 --> 02:29.271
go fish. Salmon.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.116
Someone else is frightening
fish.

02:35.151 --> 02:37.333
I scare, insurance,
Eh, Tommy?

02:37.368 --> 02:38.640
And that beard, Deke?

02:38.675 --> 02:42.331
We started very well, Tommy.
We're going for something big.

02:42.366 --> 02:44.640
But do not shave that mess
until we fill the

02:44.680 --> 02:45.688
ponds, right?

02:45.723 --> 02:47.020
Deal.

02:48.581 --> 02:49.901
Good morning, Hank.

02:49.936 --> 02:52.702
Hi, Jimbo. A perfect day, right?

02:54.416 --> 02:57.553
Well, it was perfect.

02:59.408 --> 03:02.438
Hello, Johnny. "You will leave today?

03:02.902 --> 03:06.979
Jim scaring the fish to
I pay my gas.

03:07.214 --> 03:11.318
Have you forgotten the filler? Within two
to three years there will be fish.

03:11.688 --> 03:14.754
The packaging bring progress
villages like ours.

03:14.845 --> 03:18.724
And progress has money. So
if you and your people do not understand this

03:18.859 --> 03:21.703
I'll tell you one thing: No
we interpose.

03:21.738 --> 03:23.962
It's what Custer said, Slattery.

03:23.997 --> 03:27.634
I know. You won a battle but
we win a war.

03:28.429 --> 03:31.203
Well guys! A kick ass!

03:31.238 --> 03:33.334
Just have to walk around
and start again! Vamos!

04:09.752 --> 04:11.950
Okay, Jackie. Turn it on.

04:14.012 --> 04:16.878
Come on, Jackie! Ponte
to work, go!

04:16.913 --> 04:18.243
I'm coming, Dad.

04:20.495 --> 04:23.101
- I think we caught something, Harry.
- Sure, it seems.

04:23.136 --> 04:25.363
Does it seem? We caught something!

04:25.398 --> 04:27.409
God, we caught something!

04:32.346 --> 04:34.947
I think we caught a
large, Deke.

04:44.821 --> 04:46.867
Damn! What now?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.013
Without fuel, Dad.

04:51.048 --> 04:52.569
"Without fuel?

04:52.604 --> 04:55.920
Have you been there all day and
not even check the

04:55.960 --> 04:57.479
motor fuel?

04:57.734 --> 04:59.963
- Sorry, Dad.
- Oh, come on!

04:59.998 --> 05:04.109
Feel it does not solve the problem and
to fill it, will you? Quick!

05:12.568 --> 05:15.386
Mady, starts off the machine.

05:16.623 --> 05:20.072
Help me to engage this
What do you think?

05:25.620 --> 05:27.240
Put the machine in motion.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.051
- Mady, what the hell
doing up there?

05:29.086 --> 05:30.533
No pressure, Deke.

05:30.568 --> 05:33.083
I guess the damn pump
finally broke down.

05:33.117 --> 05:35.655
Shit! Why me?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.507
We must hold.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.612
Oh, God, do you hear that?
It will break.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.732
Hey, forget about it, Jackie!
Only low to help!

05:54.994 --> 05:57.321
When the machine is broken,
hard time picking it up.

05:59.465 --> 06:01.979
Come on, boy! Stretch!
Grab it and pull!

06:02.014 --> 06:03.595
Come on, Jackie. Strip.

06:13.134 --> 06:15.200
We need to get the pressure!

06:19.755 --> 06:21.446
Jackie!

06:21.581 --> 06:23.432
Give me a harpoon.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.723
Mayday. Here, Buck-o.
We're in trouble.

06:27.758 --> 06:29.504
Hang on, Jackie! Hold on!

06:43.431 --> 06:45.200
I save my son!

06:45.235 --> 06:48.557
- I go in there!
- Deke! Deke, dammit!

06:55.881 --> 06:58.258
Deke, there is nothing you can do.

07:12.788 --> 07:14.325
I do not see in the water.

07:15.784 --> 07:18.481
Call the Coast Guard. Come on.

07:35.459 --> 07:37.150
I have you.

07:37.185 --> 07:40.466
The explosions do not occur
without reason, Jim.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.067
The oil leaked Buck-O
as a sieve, Hank.

07:43.911 --> 07:46.825
Do not you think it is very easy
cause an explosion?

07:46.860 --> 07:50.862
Nobody wants to come to this town if
these things still happen.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.739
And there are some around here that
do not want a packer.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.858
What do you mean, Hank?

07:55.893 --> 07:58.735
Do you think Johnny is
involved in this?

08:00.027 --> 08:01.691
Hey, something frightened them.

08:01.726 --> 08:04.435
Shooting at something and
was not Johnny Eagle.

08:04.470 --> 08:05.900
What?

08:06.133 --> 08:08.899
What is it? What happens?

08:12.202 --> 08:15.224
- Baron, come here.
- Adelante. Out, out.

08:20.222 --> 08:21.579
Should he go to the bathroom?

08:22.090 --> 08:23.314
So it seems.

09:32.192 --> 09:35.155
Come here, Baron. Come on, boy.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.795
"Baron, where are you?

09:43.655 --> 09:45.362
Come on, Baron.

09:50.950 --> 09:52.789
Baron, what happens?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.583
Jim, come a moment.

10:13.448 --> 10:15.307
What do you think it is?

10:17.473 --> 10:18.926
I do not know.

10:19.821 --> 10:22.483
Never before have I seen this elsewhere.

10:24.654 --> 10:26.337
The trail continues over there.

10:26.604 --> 10:28.267
Follow him.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.867
Yes

10:40.483 --> 10:42.764
Come here, Baron. Come here, boy.

10:54.506 --> 10:56.580
Where are you, boy?

11:14.887 --> 11:17.316
Hey, who needs that
crappy festival?

11:17.351 --> 11:19.886
What we need is a
private little party.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.045
All beautiful girls
neighboring counties.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.813
Sure some will sell their
Salmon back in return.

11:26.848 --> 11:28.377
My fish is my way to the top.

11:28.412 --> 11:31.718
Hey, do not take my hand
or I'll kick your ass.

11:32.945 --> 11:34.872
Well, you just went
download help

11:34.907 --> 11:37.846
I got that once or
frozen pond.

12:33.775 --> 12:38.582
How strange. The only dog?that
left alive is the Indian.

12:45.085 --> 12:47.942
Guys, we must solve
the problem.

14:32.274 --> 14:33.638
Hello?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.850
Linda, hi.

14:40.308 --> 14:44.043
No, nothing. I just got scared.
I heard some noises.

14:45.753 --> 14:48.066
Yes, I'm ready. What
What time do they come?

14:50.825 --> 14:53.735
Okay, we see ourselves. Goodbye.

15:35.888 --> 15:37.414
What the hell are you doing?

15:37.449 --> 15:38.650
Idiot.

15:38.685 --> 15:41.682
The back door was closed,
I had to enter through the side.

15:41.717 --> 15:43.818
You know you could have
been stabbed?

15:43.853 --> 15:46.599
Well, if you had done that,

15:46.804 --> 15:49.135
could not have done this.

15:55.932 --> 15:59.028
You know what I think? I'm
too scared.

16:00.267 --> 16:03.822
Also, Tommy and Linda will
here at any time.

16:03.857 --> 16:05.622
Do you understand what I mean?

16:09.443 --> 16:13.340
<i>Welcome everyone. 75 º Festival </ i>
Annual Noyo Salmon. </ i></i>

16:20.060 --> 16:21.307
Let's go there.

16:21.342 --> 16:24.190
Hi Jim, Carol. Delighted
to see them.

16:24.225 --> 16:26.540
Hey, how did you get
like clothing, friend?

16:26.575 --> 16:28.005
I just lost my wallet.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.641
Oh, sorry. Where
is your husband?

16:30.676 --> 16:34.509
I have no idea. Left with
kids for twenty minutes.

16:45.657 --> 16:47.525
Have you been drinking?

16:48.096 --> 16:50.497
Of course I was drinking.

16:53.394 --> 16:57.477
- Come on, lose the ball.
- Yes, and beer.

17:00.099 --> 17:02.555
To hell with the beer.

17:02.990 --> 17:04.740
Hey, what's this? Will Geneva?

17:04.775 --> 17:07.156
- Yes
- You remember!

17:25.473 --> 17:27.896
Thanks, folks. Thanks.

17:27.931 --> 17:31.408
Now, before continuing with Jo
Williams and the Whitewater Boys

17:31.443 --> 17:34.200
I want to introduce some
important visitors

17:34.240 --> 17:35.578
the festival this year.

17:35.613 --> 17:39.966
President Canco Inc.
Mr. Charles Borden,

17:44.238 --> 17:47.203
his special assistant,
Mr. James Edwards,

17:47.238 --> 17:50.140
and his associate, Dr. Susan Drake.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.811
Thanks, folks. Seriously.

17:57.846 --> 17:59.574
It is the speech.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.752
Now, before starting the
fun, just want to say

18:02.787 --> 18:07.751
that we are 100% interested Canco
in you and your people

18:07.786 --> 18:10.779
and we're here tonight
to promise

18:10.814 --> 18:15.200
that our packaging will be the
best thing that could happen

18:15.235 --> 18:18.187
since God created
the river and the ocean.

18:19.909 --> 18:23.527
And I will take the opportunity to
make another promise.

18:24.230 --> 18:28.403
Noyo will bring jobs and
may not believe it,

18:28.438 --> 18:31.768
but, in fact, we
fisheries enhancement.

18:31.803 --> 18:37.298
Dr. Susan Drake, great
scientific

18:37.333 --> 18:41.079
has conducted research in
our laboratories, upstream

18:41.114 --> 18:43.329
Over the past seven years.

18:43.364 --> 18:48.283
And she says she
have been manipulated

18:48.318 --> 18:53.961
how to make salmon
grow bigger, faster,

18:53.996 --> 18:56.171
and two times more abundant.

18:58.889 --> 19:02.068
Without doubt, these are news
we can really celebrate.

19:02.103 --> 19:04.704
So Jo and her band we
provide a great ball

19:04.739 --> 19:07.344
and enjoy the festival
this year.

19:31.218 --> 19:32.605
Thank you very much.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.811
From what I heard, we should
thank you for the work he has done.

19:35.846 --> 19:39.184
Jim said to be
morning fishing.

19:40.090 --> 19:42.336
Yes to gather
morning stroll.

19:42.371 --> 19:43.590
Very nice of him.

19:43.625 --> 19:47.277
Jimbo, what do you think of this girl?
It will do great things, do not you think?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.217
I'll believe it when I see it.

19:49.252 --> 19:50.871
You'll see.

20:01.141 --> 20:02.728
Jerry, what was that?

20:03.533 --> 20:05.240
There was someone outside.

20:05.275 --> 20:08.711
What? I heard nothing.

20:27.551 --> 20:32.016
All dogs were killed,
except for Eagle Johnny.

20:32.051 --> 20:35.009
Yes, that says Slattery.
Can you think of something?

20:35.044 --> 20:37.377
No, I have come to nothing.
I have no suspects.

20:37.412 --> 20:39.663
Slattery seems yes.

20:55.022 --> 20:59.768
Someone killed my dog, Slattery.
Do you know who might be?

20:59.803 --> 21:03.120
What a coincidence. Somebody Killed
seven of our dogs

21:03.160 --> 21:04.382
last night at the dock.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.374
Do you know who might be?

21:06.486 --> 21:09.082
I do not dogs murderer
get what I want.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.421
End with this.

21:16.510 --> 21:18.422
Take this to court.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.414
Buy a circle around
your lands along the River.

21:24.340 --> 21:27.105
Stop your packaging,
Slattery,

21:27.140 --> 21:30.045
and through the law. Your law!

21:32.561 --> 21:36.194
Guys, this idiot was not
invited to this party.

21:36.229 --> 21:38.495
It is disturbing to our friends.

21:39.157 --> 21:41.450
Moore, take it out of here.

21:44.211 --> 21:45.637
Take him away.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.641
Folks, nothing has happened.

21:53.276 --> 21:55.594
Come on, play music and continue
with the party.

21:59.646 --> 22:03.303
Slattery, evil bastard.
I got sick of your emissaries.

22:03.338 --> 22:05.142
Why do not you behave like
a man and face me?

22:06.092 --> 22:09.792
I'll tell you one last time: Saca
your ass out of here or I'll kick your!

22:09.827 --> 22:13.138
Think you, white boy?
Come on, just you and me!

22:13.173 --> 22:15.487
- Do not you think you can?
- I know you can.

22:15.522 --> 22:18.210
You know I can, I know
I can, everyone knows it.

22:18.245 --> 22:20.957
I'm going to convince this
idiot now.

22:21.339 --> 22:23.158
Best leave it. Let.

22:25.530 --> 22:27.278
Come on, get up.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.553
Get up and kill you!

22:30.756 --> 22:32.221
What happens here?

22:42.617 --> 22:44.232
- Grab him.
- There.

22:44.267 --> 22:46.582
Come on, Hank, give strong.

22:46.617 --> 22:48.482
Dale again.

22:51.409 --> 22:52.730
Wait here.

22:56.265 --> 22:57.903
Jim, be careful!

23:11.253 --> 23:12.988
Behind me, bro.

23:14.248 --> 23:16.083
Now, stay where you are.

23:24.280 --> 23:28.957
Well, boys, it was enough. Now
recójanse and go home.

24:57.810 --> 25:00.908
<i>Well, wait to hear what </ i>
Johnny Eagle has to say. </ i></i>

25:04.280 --> 25:06.809
<i>What makes you think that </ i>
can win, Johnny? </ i></i>

25:07.060 --> 25:09.364
<i>I just talked to a great </ i>
lawyer in Sacramento, </ i></i>

25:09.399 --> 25:13.234
<i>and is so sure it's a case </ i>
emblematic free will. </ i></i>

25:15.693 --> 25:17.805
<i>What can we do to </ i>
stop now </ i></i>

25:17.897 --> 25:21.745
<i>sue the county for violation </ i>
of our fishing rights, </ i></i>

25:21.780 --> 25:23.772
<i>Canco and bring to court. </ i></i>

25:24.392 --> 25:26.975
<i>lawyer and is working </ i>
now, </ i></i>

25:27.441 --> 25:29.711
<i>so let's deal to put </ i>
this thing moving. </ i></i>

25:55.654 --> 25:57.417
Throw the anchor, brother.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.094
Right.

26:35.199 --> 26:38.461
It's mine, I caught one! It's mine!

26:39.950 --> 26:41.558
The first of the day.

26:41.593 --> 26:43.808
It only took two hours.

26:43.862 --> 26:45.915
You will change all that
Is not it?

26:45.950 --> 26:47.847
Sure I'll try.

27:02.898 --> 27:04.883
Jerry, are you hurt?

27:05.104 --> 27:06.722
A little.

27:06.928 --> 27:08.589
But...

27:08.624 --> 27:10.925
you can make me feel
much better.

27:11.058 --> 27:13.545
That's all I have
in mind, is not it?

27:38.615 --> 27:42.309
- What will we use for bait?
- Spit.

27:43.859 --> 27:46.386
Déjenmelo to me! Let me the fish!

27:46.786 --> 27:48.242
It looks like a whale.

27:48.277 --> 27:50.495
Well, make sure the reel
before being collected.

27:50.530 --> 27:53.513
Come on, Charlie... Mr. Borden.

27:53.648 --> 27:54.852
I try!

27:54.887 --> 27:57.061
Pick a little, Mr. Borden
and then pull.

27:57.096 --> 27:58.825
Will not.

27:59.472 --> 28:01.153
Pick it up slowly and steadily.

28:01.188 --> 28:02.585
That try!

28:04.393 --> 28:06.253
It's a monster.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.520
Keep well, and he almost does.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.906
Quiet... calmly.

28:15.705 --> 28:17.494
Just a second.

28:31.547 --> 28:34.205
- Could you bring me a drink?
- Yes, sir.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.910
- Did you see what it was?
- No, not vi.

28:35.945 --> 28:37.150
And what do you take photographs?

28:37.185 --> 28:40.309
I do not know, but rather cut
stringline, Jim.

28:41.183 --> 28:43.186
We will have to monitor
water, do not you Tommy?

28:43.221 --> 28:45.569
Could you tell us what you photographed
with that thing?

28:45.604 --> 28:48.003
Will not know until reveal.

28:49.518 --> 28:51.272
Wait to see it.

29:38.384 --> 29:40.675
Come on, Jerry! Do not be stupid!

30:58.832 --> 31:02.095
Go down to find the
boat. Want to come?

31:23.922 --> 31:26.530
- Do you have that beer?
- Here they are.

31:34.202 --> 31:36.027
- How are you, boys?
- We're fine.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.977
I want to hear.

31:49.012 --> 31:52.215
We must resolve a problem
and must be now.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.115
Johnny Eagle means business.

31:55.077 --> 31:57.596
You know what resolved that
is now this place?

31:57.631 --> 32:00.204
A reservation of these Indians.

32:00.334 --> 32:02.050
And you know what you are doing?

32:02.085 --> 32:06.290
Considering hiring a lawyer against
us and the filler.

32:07.091 --> 32:11.204
So I worry.
And that's not all.

32:13.327 --> 32:15.995
It got one of those great
urbanites lawyers

32:16.030 --> 32:19.098
to protect minorities
and free help.

32:19.133 --> 32:21.454
I suppose it's for
get publicity.

32:21.489 --> 32:24.736
Should get
a lawyer, Hank.

32:24.771 --> 32:26.594
And then what?

32:26.629 --> 32:28.368
This will take two years
get to court.

32:28.403 --> 32:30.168
Do you think that these types of
packaging will wait for

32:30.203 --> 32:32.494
solve our problems?
No way!

32:33.685 --> 32:37.265
We will have to deal with
Johnny Eagle and its people,

32:37.300 --> 32:40.460
- Or not have filler.
- How?

32:42.858 --> 32:44.493
Can you think of something?

32:45.428 --> 32:47.940
As we can, that's all.

32:50.932 --> 32:52.655
- See ya, brother.
- Yes

32:53.302 --> 32:55.370
How's your face?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.018
I'm alive.

32:58.053 --> 33:00.993
- Thanks again.
- You were worse than me.

33:01.887 --> 33:03.989
Thanks anyway
both.

33:04.931 --> 33:08.708
- Any man would do the same.
- Jim, I want to talk about something.

33:09.143 --> 33:10.350
The filler.

33:10.385 --> 33:14.193
Johnny, I stand for and you do not.

33:15.084 --> 33:17.079
Nothing more to say.

33:21.781 --> 33:24.375
The truth is that even
While these rates will fall,

33:24.810 --> 33:26.811
but believes that people need
the filler and he wants

33:26.846 --> 33:29.205
- The best for the people.
- Me too.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.546
I would like to discuss
you, Tommy.

33:31.681 --> 33:33.890
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, honey.

33:33.961 --> 33:36.246
Hey, I have a lot of
salmon tonight.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.920
I need help to eat,
Why not come?

33:39.035 --> 33:41.130
- Yes, sure.
- Cool.

34:06.779 --> 34:10.748
Hey, baby, why do not you take off
that? Let's see some skin.

34:10.784 --> 34:13.190
I do not take away anything
until I see it.

34:13.226 --> 34:15.730
Okay. How about this?

34:17.221 --> 34:20.107
Come on. Show me something
more than the head.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.654
But the head is the best part.

34:23.358 --> 34:26.888
- Oh, come on.
- Why you? Okay.

34:26.922 --> 34:28.943
Billy, you really are doing.

34:28.978 --> 34:31.693
Oh, my God! Get me out of this thing.

34:31.728 --> 34:33.848
Billy, what's stopping you?

34:34.583 --> 34:37.331
Come on, Billy. I have not all day.

34:37.367 --> 34:40.098
Did you hobbled? I
lose the excitement.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.080
Hey, baby. Want
see my crazy bird?

34:44.114 --> 34:46.119
Will I be chips?

34:46.568 --> 34:49.214
Do not worry, baby.
I've been sanding.

34:52.929 --> 34:56.123
Hey, baby. I bet you never
what have you done with two dolls.

34:56.158 --> 34:58.619
As they say: "Two heads are
better than one. "

34:58.654 --> 35:00.894
Good show. It always works.

35:00.929 --> 35:02.953
What would you do without me?

35:02.988 --> 35:04.696
Well, just watch.

35:04.731 --> 35:06.834
Hey, come on. What do you think
you're doing?

35:07.207 --> 35:09.419
Two is company, three
is a crowd.

35:09.454 --> 35:13.775
- He's pretty sexy.
- Not as much as you, baby.

36:01.588 --> 36:05.304
My father used to bring
here as a child.

36:06.212 --> 36:07.946
This is beautiful.

36:07.981 --> 36:10.338
So I want to save
for my people.

36:10.373 --> 36:12.933
If not, we cover,
Who will?

36:13.576 --> 36:15.066
What is that?

36:16.287 --> 36:18.062
I do not know.

36:18.197 --> 36:20.257
There are many visitors
here.

36:20.292 --> 36:21.957
Let's go.

36:45.832 --> 36:48.150
Take the south of the river arm.

37:09.287 --> 37:11.789
- Do you still hear?
- No.

37:11.824 --> 37:15.049
No, maybe just someone
trout fishing.

37:15.084 --> 37:16.479
Yes, maybe.

37:17.459 --> 37:20.453
Look, if you want my truck to
back to town later.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.152
No way. Came
to talk and eat.

37:22.187 --> 37:24.049
And I'm good company.

37:24.084 --> 37:26.946
Okay. Then we
to clean some fish.

37:37.924 --> 37:40.237
Come as much as possible.

37:59.473 --> 38:01.029
- Hi, honey.
- You scared me.

38:01.064 --> 38:02.583
I thought you were cleaning fish.

38:02.618 --> 38:04.502
I wanted to come see if you were okay.

38:04.537 --> 38:06.401
How sweet.

38:06.436 --> 38:09.486
I care for a woman so pretty,
Soft and warm as you.

38:21.043 --> 38:22.463
There is.

38:22.614 --> 38:24.417
Shit. I do not like this.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.572
Shut up, fag. We
agree.

38:26.607 --> 38:28.766
Let us move a little closer.

38:29.118 --> 38:30.631
Whatever.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.940
Let's do it.

38:56.153 --> 38:57.548
Comrades.

39:01.878 --> 39:03.376
Tommy, on the ground!

39:18.438 --> 39:20.241
We will bring water.

39:22.687 --> 39:25.353
- Who was it?
- I do not know, I could not see them.

39:42.295 --> 39:43.782
We have to keep it from spreading.

39:43.817 --> 39:46.429
Peggy, take my truck and
tries to find help.

39:57.919 --> 39:59.543
Coward!

40:01.327 --> 40:03.381
Keep running, you bastard!

40:04.792 --> 40:06.744
I will follow up the people!

43:05.900 --> 43:07.114
Hello.

43:07.177 --> 43:08.378
Good morning.

43:08.413 --> 43:09.757
I would like to rent a boat.

43:09.792 --> 43:12.886
I would not recommend. Al
least not this morning.

43:15.697 --> 43:17.031
Thanks.

43:31.767 --> 43:34.717
Jerry and Peggy missing
Linda is dead...

43:34.752 --> 43:37.297
What the hell is going on here?

43:37.404 --> 43:39.691
All I know is that Linda was
Eagle in the van.

43:39.726 --> 43:41.284
Yes, what about it?

43:43.244 --> 43:44.992
See what I see?

43:52.520 --> 43:54.742
Where did this boat
that fool?

44:03.411 --> 44:05.461
Explanations have
to give, Johnny.

44:05.496 --> 44:07.912
Help me upload it here.

44:19.573 --> 44:21.620
- I'm with him.
- Yes, stay with him.

44:21.655 --> 44:24.128
- Come on, take him away from here!
- Go!

44:34.589 --> 44:38.475
- How big were they?
- 6.5 to 7 feet tall.

44:38.906 --> 44:40.633
How many dresses?

44:41.881 --> 44:43.828
What the hell is happening?
What happened to my brother?

44:43.863 --> 44:47.517
You will not believe this. They say it was
a kind of sea monster.

44:47.552 --> 44:50.342
So, sea monsters!
They burned his house

44:50.377 --> 44:53.102
attacked your brother, and even
brought their dead, right?

44:53.136 --> 44:55.466
Well, I'll go there.
Anybody with me?

44:55.501 --> 44:57.269
- Why?
- To look for evidence.

44:57.304 --> 44:59.858
Something caused the accident
Buck-O and killed those dogs.

44:59.893 --> 45:02.963
Now human attacks. The
that is, not him.

45:02.998 --> 45:05.188
I need a partner, Slattery.
What say you?

45:05.223 --> 45:06.614
It's a waste of time.

45:06.649 --> 45:08.370
Scared?

45:08.735 --> 45:10.499
Fear of what?

45:13.256 --> 45:15.506
- Potter?
- My son did not return last night.

45:15.541 --> 45:17.621
Neither Peggy. I
looking for my son

45:17.656 --> 45:19.991
I have no time to go
after sea creatures.

45:20.026 --> 45:21.401
I'll go with you, Jim.

45:21.436 --> 45:25.715
A moment. Do not think you should go
before you speak.

45:27.010 --> 45:28.902
Want to join me, Hank?

45:29.165 --> 45:30.852
I have my priorities, Jim.

45:30.887 --> 45:33.521
I should be in the hospital
when it is your brother.

45:33.819 --> 45:35.496
Then, you'll need
communicate it to me to me.

45:35.531 --> 45:38.537
I need it. Been there,
know what we want.

45:38.572 --> 45:40.684
- I'll go with you, Jim.
- Do not need anyone else.

45:40.719 --> 45:44.015
Forget your manners obsolete. I
a professional scientist!

45:44.050 --> 45:45.350
Let's go.

46:24.205 --> 46:25.991
This is where we
for the first time.

46:26.026 --> 46:27.467
Well, look at this.

46:29.062 --> 46:30.537
Let's see...

46:30.691 --> 46:32.933
Know much more if we leave here.

46:37.575 --> 46:39.637
What am I supposed you are looking for now?

46:40.092 --> 46:42.933
See if you left a card
visit, I guess.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.120
Definitely been here.

46:56.155 --> 46:58.234
No joking, right?

46:58.269 --> 47:00.689
Do you think that more of these
creatures around here?

47:00.724 --> 47:02.599
I thought I heard
something down.

47:02.634 --> 47:04.951
I said I thought I heard something.

47:04.986 --> 47:07.842
The type of attack that he described,
is a nocturnal predator,

47:07.877 --> 47:09.911
therefore probably
hide during the day,

47:09.946 --> 47:11.754
unless your territory
is threatened.

47:11.930 --> 47:14.234
- Is this is your territory?
- Not sure.

47:14.269 --> 47:16.520
We found evidence that
were here last night

47:16.560 --> 47:17.617
but it means nothing.

47:17.652 --> 47:22.468
Judging by its size,
must be of the ocean.

47:22.503 --> 47:24.469
Seems pretty confident.

47:24.504 --> 47:26.441
I must be with men
like you out there.

47:26.476 --> 47:28.098
Come on. Let's get out of here.

47:35.042 --> 47:36.429
What's this?

47:36.464 --> 47:39.523
Is quite similar, but
head is much larger.

47:39.550 --> 47:42.183
Must have developed
more than I imagined.

47:42.618 --> 47:44.846
And perhaps more intelligent.

47:45.157 --> 47:46.806
Johnny, grab it.

47:57.789 --> 48:00.129
Damn, a salmon.

48:03.405 --> 48:06.337
First time I let myself down
to see a fish.

48:06.372 --> 48:10.002
Think about this: Finding salmon
of this size here

48:10.037 --> 48:13.041
can not be so far
to find what you seek.

48:35.077 --> 48:37.230
I just talked to my
wife on the radio.

48:37.265 --> 48:39.779
The doctor says my
brother will be fine.

48:39.814 --> 48:41.610
Has anyone talked to him?

48:41.645 --> 48:44.297
No, still unconscious.

48:44.432 --> 48:46.868
But his vital signs are strong.

48:48.557 --> 48:51.353
How much do you know and
tells us, Drake?

48:52.236 --> 48:54.746
Could I leave those things
and treat me a moment?

48:54.781 --> 48:56.988
You have seen what I did.

48:57.023 --> 48:58.758
You say you are smart,

48:58.793 --> 49:01.430
surprised by the size
their jaws.

49:01.565 --> 49:04.733
Other than that, is very
interested in the subject.

49:06.605 --> 49:09.691
- That cove, Jim.
- What about her?

49:10.279 --> 49:14.842
Seems to have caves
there. Where do they lead?

50:16.575 --> 50:18.466
There's your evidence.

50:23.588 --> 50:24.867
See that?

50:26.883 --> 50:29.800
No, do not shoot until you tell them.

50:31.921 --> 50:33.206
Now!

50:35.323 --> 50:37.196
Now, shoot!

51:24.845 --> 51:26.276
Are you okay?

51:26.817 --> 51:28.423
I owe my life.

51:47.614 --> 51:49.168
Oh, my God.

51:52.016 --> 51:53.342
Who is it?

51:55.709 --> 51:57.573
God, it's Peggy.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.950
Still alive. Take it from here.

53:01.120 --> 53:03.604
What the hell are these
things, anyway?

53:04.911 --> 53:09.768
First, from what I know so far
This species makes its appearance.

53:09.803 --> 53:12.279
But there must be a reason for
a humanoid creature

53:12.314 --> 53:14.151
evolve so quickly.

53:14.639 --> 53:17.536
- Do you see the guts in his head?
- Yes, like a fish.

53:17.571 --> 53:19.019
But they do pretty well
coming to earth.

53:19.054 --> 53:21.424
Yes, we know so far.

53:21.459 --> 53:24.354
But his natural habitat
is clear, water.

53:24.834 --> 53:27.953
So I guess that is in process
to become amphibious.

53:28.025 --> 53:30.003
Look at the size of the skull.

53:30.038 --> 53:33.537
That means they have a
tremendous brain capacity.

53:33.728 --> 53:37.295
Though not mean they have the
ability to use it in its entirety.

53:37.330 --> 53:38.725
Look.

53:39.759 --> 53:41.159
Developed hands.

53:41.194 --> 53:44.435
Why not return to Noyo? Les
know if we find something.

53:44.470 --> 53:46.896
Forget it. We're not going to
get answers.

53:46.931 --> 53:49.311
- Do not worry.
- Mr. Borden suggested

53:49.346 --> 53:52.320
keep this secret
Canco has a chance until

53:52.360 --> 53:53.069
for revision.

53:53.104 --> 53:55.480
His theory could be totally
incorrect.

53:55.515 --> 53:57.918
What the hell are you talking about?

53:57.953 --> 54:00.520
I tried to warn
this long ago and

54:00.560 --> 54:01.714
I stepped aside.

54:01.749 --> 54:04.240
Well look at it, Edwards! Is
right in front of you!

54:04.275 --> 54:06.740
Damn stupid! Look!

54:07.222 --> 54:09.967
And still insists that my
theory is wrong?

54:10.204 --> 54:14.664
My theory is incorrect and
I will not be quieter.

54:14.699 --> 54:18.513
And these people have the right
viz. And I'll tell you.

54:18.548 --> 54:22.605
Put the film 232, DNA
in the conference room.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.063
Now, Edwards!

54:36.659 --> 54:38.422
DNA-5 is a stimulant
growth.

54:38.457 --> 54:42.860
What you see is a film of the first
DNA-5 experiments with frogs.

54:48.175 --> 54:51.691
These are tadpoles
in the larval stage.

54:51.726 --> 54:54.525
The tadpoles take 12 weeks
to become adult frogs.

54:54.560 --> 54:58.838
Now we apply DNA-5,
carries genetic information

54:58.873 --> 55:01.841
stimulating hormone
growth in frogs.

55:04.413 --> 55:08.391
Using DNA-5, reaching
to adult in a matter of days.

55:08.426 --> 55:10.083
And what's the point?

55:10.118 --> 55:13.327
Duplicate this process to accelerate
growth in salmon.

55:13.362 --> 55:17.277
When a storm destroyed one of
our experimental ponds

55:17.312 --> 55:20.972
3000-treated salmon
DNA-5 escaped into the ocean.

55:21.007 --> 55:24.080
I wanted to notify the
authorities, but my employer

55:24.120 --> 55:25.223
of cancer, I stopped.

55:34.015 --> 55:35.948
What if the other fish
they had been eaten?

55:35.983 --> 55:37.379
Exactly.

55:38.655 --> 55:41.622
My theory is that by feeding
salmon treated with DNA-5

55:41.657 --> 55:44.400
could accelerate the evolution
a more primitive fish,

55:44.440 --> 55:45.407
as the coelacanth,

55:45.442 --> 55:48.400
which was discovered in this
area a few years ago

55:48.440 --> 55:49.859
a local marine biologist.

55:51.566 --> 55:54.261
What the hell is a coelacanth?

55:54.551 --> 55:56.829
It is a kind of prehistoric fish

55:56.864 --> 55:59.395
that has not evolved
in millions of years.

55:59.430 --> 56:03.625
But I could have done to
salmon fed with DNA-5.

56:03.660 --> 56:06.262
I took these pictures this morning.

56:09.918 --> 56:15.340
In a life, this creature seems
make four stages of evolution.

56:15.375 --> 56:20.197
See that as a fish, but is humanoid
early stage.

56:20.232 --> 56:22.304
Why attack us?

56:23.603 --> 56:25.604
Well, most
predators

56:25.639 --> 56:28.337
protect its territory and
their food sources.

56:28.854 --> 56:30.428
Perhaps it is enough
intelligent

56:30.463 --> 56:33.185
to perceive the man
as a competitor.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.091
Why girls?

56:37.126 --> 56:40.280
My theory is that these creatures
have the impulse

56:40.320 --> 56:41.617
mate with humans

56:41.652 --> 56:44.215
development of
incredible evolution.

56:44.250 --> 56:46.252
These things almost killed me with fright.

56:46.484 --> 56:49.123
Who among the people will believe us?

56:51.258 --> 56:53.864
Rays. The festival.

56:54.299 --> 56:55.606
Oh, my God.

57:37.981 --> 57:41.480
I'm the Mad Mike Michaels
broadcasting live from

57:41.520 --> 57:43.116
Salmon Festival.

57:43.151 --> 57:45.331
We here at Radio K-Pez
in the Salmon Festival.

57:45.366 --> 57:49.666
And here's my favorite skater,
Katie. How are you?

57:50.835 --> 57:52.898
Listen, she will walk
hanging around

57:52.933 --> 57:56.429
and if caught, will win
free visor.

57:56.570 --> 58:00.276
And now, I'm here to
local beauty this year:

58:00.311 --> 58:02.723
Miss Salmon, Sandy.
How are you, Sandy?

58:02.758 --> 58:04.896
- I'm fine.
- Oh, great.

58:09.013 --> 58:11.139
Jo, can you play something
a little faster?

58:11.174 --> 58:12.979
How about something to dance?

58:13.862 --> 58:16.304
I'm not in the mood for
something more upbeat.

58:16.339 --> 58:18.817
Well, Jo, me neither, but

58:18.852 --> 58:22.458
After all, we have come 2 or
3 miles to have a good time.

58:22.493 --> 58:24.634
Never before have they failed.

58:24.669 --> 58:26.776
Come on, now touch
somewhat faster.

58:26.811 --> 58:29.276
- Okay.
- Come on, folks. Enjoy.

58:29.964 --> 58:34.035
That is, that's better. Come
friends. Enjoy.

58:34.170 --> 58:36.588
That is, that's better.
That's great.

58:36.623 --> 58:40.136
At least we are moving
very well. Hello, how are you?

58:40.171 --> 58:42.834
And success and we'll play
many things.

58:42.869 --> 58:46.069
Listen, if you have a phone call.
I love to talk to you.

58:46.104 --> 58:49.320
But I can not talk much
time, may have

58:49.360 --> 58:50.525
my hands busy.

59:51.998 --> 59:58.416
This is the big fish, K-Pez, the
Noyo voice, Noyo, Noyo...

01:00:07.995 --> 01:00:09.538
What's up, guys?

01:00:12.407 --> 01:00:13.734
Did you have luck?

01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:15.264
Should be gone.

01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:16.647
"They searched the caves?

01:00:16.682 --> 01:00:18.920
Potter and Larson went to
review, but I think

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.942
a waste of time.

01:00:19.977 --> 01:00:22.489
- I go for a beer.
- Yes

01:00:23.479 --> 01:00:25.781
Our friends, Johnny Eagle
and Jim did not come back yet?

01:00:25.816 --> 01:00:27.325
I have not seen.

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:29.716
Not find anything.

01:00:30.603 --> 01:00:34.364
That Indian must be there
doing it with a buffalo.

01:00:36.354 --> 01:00:38.632
- Hey, here is beer.
- Okay.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:40.545
Give us four!

01:00:58.561 --> 01:01:00.807
- Did you find something, Jim?
- Very.

01:01:00.993 --> 01:01:03.079
Is that one of the monsters
Johnny marine?

01:01:03.114 --> 01:01:05.325
Right under your nose, Slattery.

01:01:13.197 --> 01:01:14.847
What is that?

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.362
Wait! We know
where these things come

01:01:21.397 --> 01:01:25.022
but we have no idea
how many there are.

01:01:26.299 --> 01:01:29.198
Jake, Jake, Jake. Found
Peggy

01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:32.260
She'll be fine. Sorry, Jake.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.146
Do not panic!

01:01:48.481 --> 01:01:51.196
One moment, seems to be some
kind of disturbance,

01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:53.996
I'm not sure if it is a
accident or something. Oh, my God.

01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:17.445
There are 50 gallons of fuel
there. Starts pumping.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.063
What's happening?

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.616
Moore!

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:47.050
Please! My sister
down there.

01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:50.863
- Who is down there?
- My sister.

01:07:50.898 --> 01:07:52.689
Is there and is going to fall.

01:07:52.724 --> 01:07:54.440
Take me to her! Vamos!

01:07:59.091 --> 01:08:01.029
- Help me, please!
- Amy, give me your hand.

01:08:01.064 --> 01:08:02.360
- Help me!
- Come on.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:03.865
Amy!

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.979
Come, stretch and reach my hand.

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:07.609
Amy, hold my hand!

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.010
Amy!

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:17.872
Hold on! Hold on!

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:25.880
Come on. Come on, climb.

01:08:25.915 --> 01:08:27.901
Climb! Come on, climb!

01:08:27.935 --> 01:08:30.600
Come, help! Help her!

01:08:31.746 --> 01:08:32.962
Take!

01:08:32.997 --> 01:08:34.518
Send them to hell!

01:08:44.515 --> 01:08:47.198
Well, just go away. Just go away!

01:09:17.303 --> 01:09:19.350
Give me your hand, Slattery.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:26.037
Damn, give me your hand!

01:10:51.821 --> 01:10:53.246
Tie it.

01:10:54.602 --> 01:10:55.965
Hurry!

01:11:29.338 --> 01:11:30.603
Where is my wife?

01:11:30.638 --> 01:11:32.382
I took home from the hospital.

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:34.097
Go for it, Jim.

01:12:02.164 --> 01:12:03.957
- No way.
- Do not escape.

01:12:04.892 --> 01:12:07.949
- We got caught.
- Now, give. Kill him.

01:12:18.139 --> 01:12:22.026
Appleberry calling J-356
at Appleberry J-357

01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:23.316
Will I be back?

01:12:32.459 --> 01:12:34.413
Stay here, baby. Stay here.

01:13:51.337 --> 01:13:53.552
Go, go!

01:13:53.587 --> 01:13:55.024
Oh, God!

01:15:11.352 --> 01:15:13.799
Carol! Carol, Carol...

01:15:14.762 --> 01:15:17.722
- Carol, are you okay?
- Yes

01:15:17.961 --> 01:15:20.501
- Does the child?
- Okay.

01:15:22.075 --> 01:15:23.824
Thank God.

01:15:29.427 --> 01:15:30.940
All is well, baby.

01:16:04.679 --> 01:16:06.492
All right. All is well.

01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:11.654
Hank!

01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:15.169
Hank...

01:16:19.798 --> 01:16:22.920
Hank, where's Drake? Dr.
Drake, are you okay?

01:16:22.955 --> 01:16:26.413
- Dr. Drake!
- Yes, yes, yes. She's fine.

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:28.909
- Where?
- Returned to the laboratory.

01:16:29.144 --> 01:16:31.674
- Returned to the laboratory.
- Hank...

01:16:32.136 --> 01:16:34.835
Jim, let's go home
now, right?

01:16:35.741 --> 01:16:38.565
I mean, everything is fine,
Is not it, sheriff?

01:16:49.637 --> 01:16:52.066
Peggy, focus.

01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:56.262
Hold on, Peggy.

01:16:57.192 --> 01:16:58.640
In a short.

01:16:59.574 --> 01:17:02.287
That's right. You're doing
fantastic.

01:17:02.765 --> 01:17:04.463
Puja, Peggy.

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.928
That's right. Come on, Peggy. Push, push.
