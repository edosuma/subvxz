NOT A CHANCE.
YOUR SPERM IS TOTALLY SEXIST.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.959
MY. REITER,
YOUR X-RAY IS CLEAR.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.417
YEAH, I'M BETTER NOW.
MY LEGS HAVE STOPPED TINGLING.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.750
SEE? EVERYTHING WORKS.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.375
UNTIL IT DOESN'T, RIGHT?
AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE?

08:50.417 --> 08:51.583
ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

08:51.625 --> 08:52.792
JAMES PETERSON.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.125
WELCOME, DR. PETERSON.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.333
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING IS
THAT TODD HERE TENDS TO DEVELOP

08:56.375 --> 08:59.041
SYMPATHETIC SYMPTOMS WITH
EACH OF HIS WIFE'S PREGNANCIES.
(pen clicks)

08:59.083 --> 09:01.333
THIS IS OUR FOURTH.
THE FIRST ONE, HE GOT RASHES.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.041
ITCHED LIKE CRAZY.
SECOND KID, ABDOMINAL CRAMPS.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.458
WORSE THAN MY LABOR PAINS. YOU
SHOULD'VE HEARD THE MAN SCREAM.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.041
AND THE THIRD ONE
WAS FAINTING SPELLS.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.625
(laughs) I HAD TO PICK HIM UP
OFF THE L&amp;D FLOOR.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.583
SCALP LAC, 14 STITCHES.

09:12.625 --> 09:14.625
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY DOWN
HERE JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.667
IT'S CRAZY TONIGHT. BUT I'LL GET
YOU UPSTAIRS AS SOON AS I CAN.

09:17.709 --> 09:19.917
ALL THE PREVIOUS SYMPTOMS--
THEY JUST GOT BETTER?

09:19.959 --> 09:23.000
SOON AS THE BABIES CAME.
I CALL IT FUN WITH CRAZY.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.166
(chuckles) I'D STILL LIKE TO GET
A NEURO CONSULT.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.041
HE'S FINE. HE'S A PAIN
IN MY ASS, BUT HE'S FINE.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.083
IT'D MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
TO HAVE THE CONSULT.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.041
AND IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE
TO KEEP CHECKING ON YOU, TOO.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.583
MM. CAREFUL, TODD.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.792
I MIGHT LEAVE HERE WITH A BABY
AND A NEW HUSBAND.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:38.125 --> 09:40.041
I TOLD DAD I COULD
STAY HOME ALONE.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.375
HE'S YOURS?
YEP.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.583
WHAT HAPPENED TO HILDY?

09:42.625 --> 09:44.583
SHE'S FINE. GOT REAR-ENDED.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.083
NO ONE IN L.A. CAN DRIVE
IN THE RAIN.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.291
KID'S GOT A POINT.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.750
ARE YOU DR. PETERSON?

09:48.792 --> 09:49.959
YEAH, BUT "JAMES" IS FINE.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.333
DR. SHEPHERD. NEUROSURGERY.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.959
YOU WANTED A CONSULT
ON THIS... TODD REITER?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.041
TRANSIENT WEAKNESS.
HIS SYMPTOMS HAVE RESOLVED.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.625
HAVE HIM MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
TO SEE ME LATER THIS WEEK.

09:57.667 --> 10:00.041
ON EXAM, HE HAD A SYMMETRICAL
INCREASE IN HIS REFLEXES.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.041
IMPRESSIVE...

10:02.083 --> 10:03.917
AND NONDIAGNOSTIC, THAT COULD BE
ANY ONE OF A THOUSAND THINGS.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.959
WHICH IS WHY I WILL SEE HIM
FOR FOLLOW-UP IN MY OFFICE.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.792
I REALLY THINK HE NEEDS--
SEND HIM HOME.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.709
I NEED A C.T.
OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.

10:14.750 --> 10:15.875
BUT SHE JUST SAID--

10:15.917 --> 10:17.041
AND I SAID, GET THE C.T.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.458
OKAY.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.959
IT'S GAME TIME, BABY.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.083
(siren wailing in distance)

10:27.125 --> 10:29.041
KAREN.
UH, THAT'S HIM.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.000
OH. DR. PETERSON?

10:31.041 --> 10:32.709
SHELDON WALLACE.
YOU PAGED ME ABOUT, UH...

10:32.750 --> 10:34.291
NICK CALHOUN, CURTAIN 2.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.041
YEAH, DID HE, UH...

10:36.083 --> 10:38.959
HE HAS A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION,
AND, UH, I WASN'T SURE IF, UH...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.333
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE?

10:40.375 --> 10:42.291
NO, HE'S JUST HAVING AN ADVERSE
REACTION TO SOME NEW MEDS.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.250
NAUSEA, VOMITING.

10:44.291 --> 10:47.083
HE GOT DEHYDRATED
AND NEARLY PASSED OUT.
(curtain rings swoosh)

10:47.125 --> 10:49.875
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.458
(curtain rings swoosh)

10:51.500 --> 10:52.709
WHERE YOU HEADED, THE PROM?

10:55.625 --> 10:57.000
HOW YOU FEELING?

10:57.041 --> 10:59.750
BETTER NOW.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.041
I-I DON'T HAVE TO STOP
THE TREATMENT, DO I?

11:02.083 --> 11:04.333
PLEASE, I'LL--I'LL TRY TO BE
BETTER ABOUT STAYING HYDRATED.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.500
ADVERSE REACTIONS ARE COMMON
WHEN STARTING NEW DRUGS.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.125
IT MAY SIMPLY BE ABOUT
ALTERING THE DOSAGE.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.000
GOOD, OKAY,

11:11.041 --> 11:13.792
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE WORKING.

11:13.834 --> 11:16.375
AND YOUR SEXUAL URGES,
YOUR...

11:16.417 --> 11:18.083
YOUR THOUGHTS OF CHILDREN
AND YOUR GODDAUGHTER?

11:18.125 --> 11:19.208
LESS.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.041
I FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE HAPPENING LESS,

11:21.083 --> 11:24.417
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING
MORE CONTROL OVER THEM.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.834
MAYBE IF I CAN JUST
KEEP TAKING THE DRUGS, YOU KNOW?

11:27.875 --> 11:30.250
MAYBE...

11:30.291 --> 11:33.041
WELL, MAYBE I COULD
END UP NORMAL.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.250
IT'S ALL ABOUT PROGRESS,
NICK,

11:35.291 --> 11:37.792
AND YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.041
THANK YOU, DR. WALLACE.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.041
(Pam exhales deeply) OOH.

11:44.083 --> 11:47.041
CRAP. WHY DOES THIS HURT MORE
THAN THE OTHER THREE?

11:47.083 --> 11:48.458
OR DID I JUST FORGET AGAIN?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.041
WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY,
BUT EVERY LABOR IS DIFFERENT.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.041
AT LEAST FOR TODD. (laughs)
FUNNY, PAM. VERY FUNNY.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.041
YOU ALMOST BROKE MY HAND
ON THAT LAST ONE.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.041
OH, I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.542
HI. I'M STEPHANIE.
I'M YOUR NURSE.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.041
STEPHANIE.
WELCOME TO THE PARTY.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.041
ANY HALFWAY DECENT PARTY
HAS SNACKS.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.083
DARLING, WHO OF THE TWO OF US

12:04.125 --> 12:06.041
ACTUALLY NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION
RIGHT NOW?

12:06.083 --> 12:08.041
YOU, SWEETIE.
YOU DO ALL THE HARD WORK.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.041
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU--
YEAH, ENOUGH SUCKING UP.
WE NEED TO FOCUS.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.417
DON'T TELL THEM THE BABY'S SEX.
THEY LIKE TO BE SURPRISED.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.041
OHH. HOW MANY YEARS
HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER?

12:15.083 --> 12:16.291
FEELS LIKE... A CENTURY?

12:16.333 --> 12:17.500
(laughs)

12:17.542 --> 12:19.291
15 YEARS OF WEDDED BLISS.

12:19.333 --> 12:20.917
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN NOW
FOR YOU AND DR. BENNETT?

12:20.959 --> 12:23.375
OH! NO. NO, UH...

12:23.417 --> 12:24.500
SAM AND I AREN'T TOGETHER
ANYMORE.

12:24.542 --> 12:25.875
I'M SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

12:25.917 --> 12:28.041
AND SO IS HE.
MM.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.041
IS SHE AS PRETTY AS YOU?

12:29.083 --> 12:30.583
PRETTIER.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.041
(chuckles)

12:32.083 --> 12:34.166
(chuckles) THANK YOU.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.709
OH! I...

12:35.750 --> 12:37.333
I CAN'T--I CAN'T BELIEVE
I BROUGHT THIS UP.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.417
I-I-I'M... IN LABOR.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.291
YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING
THAT I SAY, JUST ASK TODD.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.083
WAY TO STICK YOUR FOOT IN IT,
BABY.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.417
IT'S FINE, REALLY.
IT'S FINE.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.041
OH, HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.709
HAND, TODD.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.041
OOH. (inhales sharply)

12:50.083 --> 12:53.041
I'M SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG
TO GET A BED.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.917
(inhales and exhales deeply)

12:54.959 --> 12:56.959
NOT AGAIN.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.041
PLEASE.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.959
MEGAN, I'M--I'M SORRY.
YOU...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.041
YOU LOST THE BABY.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.041
OH, BUT WE MADE IT
TO 12 WEEKS.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.208
I KNOW.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.458
(sighs deeply)
I TOLD PEOPLE.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.583
THERE ARE GIFTS.

13:11.417 --> 13:15.041
MEGAN, THE MISCARRIAGE
WAS INCOMPLETE.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.250
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
PERFORM A D&amp;C

13:17.291 --> 13:19.625
ONCE AN O.R. OPENS UP.
ALL RIGHT?

13:22.125 --> 13:25.000
DADDY'S OUT OF TOWN.

13:27.041 --> 13:29.166
WHEN CAN WE TRY AGAIN?

13:29.208 --> 13:33.125
LET'S TAKE THINGS
ONE STEP AT A TIME. OKAY?

13:35.959 --> 13:38.667
(indistinct conversations)

13:38.709 --> 13:40.041
EXCUSE ME.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.625
I'M LOOKING FOR SARAH NELSON.
SHE'S A 7-YEAR-OLD.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.041
CURTAIN 1.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.083
ARE YOU THE--
THE NEW E.R. ATTENDING?

13:46.125 --> 13:48.000
YEAH.
YOU'RE FROM D.C.F.S., RIGHT?

13:48.041 --> 13:51.417
NO. UH, DR. TURNER.
PSYCHIATRY.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.375
VI, SARAH'S THIS WAY.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.041
PSYCHIATRY?

13:55.083 --> 13:56.750
WE AGREED THAT D.C.F.S.
WOULD BE CALLED.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.125
NO, WE AGREED THAT I WOULD
MAKE A CALL,

13:58.166 --> 14:01.041
AND DR. TURNER'S MORE THAN
QUALIFIED TO EVALUATE SARAH.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.208
THAT'S NOT THE PROTOCOL.
REALLY HUNG UP
ON THE PROTOCOL, HUH

14:03.250 --> 14:04.750
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:04.792 --> 14:06.917
YOUR PEDIATRICIAN SEEMS TO HAVE
TROUBLE WITH THE RULES,

14:06.959 --> 14:09.041
AND, WELL, THE TRUTH.
WHOA. EASY THERE, JUNIOR.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.834
LOOK, D.C.F.S. COULD TAKE HOURS.
LET ME HELP YOU OUT WITH SARAH.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.834
JAMES, WE'RE SLAMMED. VIOLET'S
A TERRIFIC PSYCHIATRIST.

14:14.875 --> 14:17.166
WHY DOES MY KID NEED A SHRINK?
SHE BROKE HER ARM.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.041
THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE
OF QUESTIONABLE INJURIES.

14:19.083 --> 14:22.250
YOU THINK I HURT MY DAUGHTER?
RON, DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

14:22.291 --> 14:23.750
THERE ARE PROTOCOLS
FOR A REASON.

14:23.792 --> 14:26.750
SARAH?
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
(curtain rings swoosh)

14:26.792 --> 14:27.959
YOU OKAY?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.458
MOMMY, I'M GETTING A CAST
ON MY ARM.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.041
(sighs)
WHY IS EVERYBODY SO MAD?

14:32.083 --> 14:33.208
IT'S OKAY, BABY. IT'S OKAY.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.041
CAN I TAKE HER HOME
AFTER THE CAST?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.375
SARAH'S WITH ME THIS WEEKEND.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.583
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP HER SAFE,

14:37.625 --> 14:39.250
THEN SHE IS NOT GONNA
BE WITH YOU ANYMORE.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.667
I AM SUING YOU
FOR SOLE CUSTODY!
NO! I WANNA BE WITH DADDY, TOO!

14:42.709 --> 14:44.750
LET'S--LET'S DISCUSS THIS
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING MY DAUGHTER
AWAY FROM ME.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.333
I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO PROTECT MY BABY.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.041
MOMMY, DADDY, STOP FIGHTING!

14:48.083 --> 14:51.041
ENOUGH!
EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE NOW.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.709
SORRY IT GOT
SO CRAZY BEFORE.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.917
IT'S OKAY.

14:58.959 --> 15:01.000
HEY, I LIKE YOUR RAINCOAT.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.041
PURPLE'S MY FAVORITE COLOR.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.792
DADDY BOUGHT THAT FOR ME.

15:06.834 --> 15:10.041
YOU LOVE YOUR DADDY A LOT,
DON'T YOU?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.458
AND MY MOMMY.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
AND THEY LOVE YOU, TOO.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.041
BUT SOMETIMES THEY GET MAD
AND YELL?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.458
THEY YELL A LOT.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.834
AT YOU?

15:20.875 --> 15:23.041
WELL...

15:23.083 --> 15:24.333
MOMMY DID ONCE.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.333
HOW COME?

15:26.375 --> 15:28.750
I COLORED ON THE WALL
IN MY ROOM.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.542
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DADDY?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.250
(sighs)

15:34.291 --> 15:37.041
WHEN I'M NOT CAREFUL
AND I HURT MYSELF,

15:37.083 --> 15:39.625
HE SAYS IT MAKES HIM WORRY,

15:39.667 --> 15:41.250
AND HE DOESN'T WANT
TO WORRY.

15:41.291 --> 15:44.417
SO MOST OF THE TIME
WHEN THEY YELL,

15:44.458 --> 15:47.834
IT'S AT EACH OTHER?

15:47.875 --> 15:49.041
YEAH.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.125
HAS IT ALWAYS
BEEN LIKE THAT?

15:51.166 --> 15:52.291
(sighs)

15:52.333 --> 15:54.959
JUST SINCE DADDY WAS BAD.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.083
MOMMY WON'T FORGIVE HIM.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.500
HOW DO YOU FEEL
WHEN THEY FIGHT?

16:04.417 --> 16:06.583
I WANNA RUN AWAY.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.291
DAMN, SHELDON.
YOU LOOK LIKE JAMES BOND.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.583
YEAH? WHICH ONE?

16:15.625 --> 16:17.166
I WAS ALWAYS PARTIAL
TO SEAN CONNERY.

16:17.208 --> 16:20.041
LYTES WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.
LIVER ENZYMES LOOK GOOD.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.041
TIME TO SEND HIM HOME.
YEAH, ACTUALLY,

16:22.083 --> 16:23.458
I WOULD LIKE TO OBSERVE HIM FOR
A WHILE. I ADJUSTED HIS MEDS.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.041
I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT HE
DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER REACTION.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.792
WE NEED THE BED.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.041
WELL, HE'S IN
A VERY FRAGILE STATE.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.625
YOU KNOW, HE JUST NEEDS
A FEW MORE HOURS.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.041
A FEW MORE HOURS WON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HIM.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.083
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.709
I SAW THE CHART.
I KNOW WHAT YOU PRESCRIBED.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.041
YOUR PATIENT CAN'T BE HELPED.
HE'S A SEXUAL DEVIANT.

16:36.083 --> 16:39.166
NO, HE'S A MAN AFFLICTED
WITH CERTAIN... URGES.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.583
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.291
SO YOU THINK I SHOULD JUST
IGNORE HIS SUFFERING, HUH?

16:42.333 --> 16:44.041
SEND HIM ON HIS WAY?
I THINK YOU SHOULD LOCK HIM UP
AND THROW AWAY THE KEY.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.208
(chuckles) WOW.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.750
I GUESS YOU MISSED THAT DAY
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL

16:46.792 --> 16:48.041
WHEN THEY DISCUSSED

(scoffs) WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:34.542 --> 24:38.667
UH... X-RAYS ARE BACK,
AND THE CAST HAS BEEN PLACED.

24:38.709 --> 24:39.875
I WAS JUST WAITING
TO DISCHARGE HER.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.917
HER RAINCOAT'S
NOT HERE.

24:41.959 --> 24:43.709
I-I WAS JUST GONE FOR, LIKE...

24:43.750 --> 24:46.375
THE NURSES WERE ALL AROUND.
WHERE IS SHE?

24:46.417 --> 24:47.583
SARAH?

24:47.625 --> 24:49.959
SARAH?
WELL, DANA, LET'S...

24:50.000 --> 24:52.792
SARAH? SARAH?
(curtain rings swooshing)

24:52.834 --> 24:54.375
(Ron) DANA.
SARAH? HAVE YOU--
HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAUGHTER?

24:54.417 --> 24:56.166
SARAH? OH, MY GOD.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.291
OH, MY GOD. SARAH?

24:57.333 --> 24:58.583
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SARAH!

24:58.625 --> 25:00.250
THEIR DAUGHTER'S MISSING.
SARAH!

25:00.291 --> 25:02.000
(Ron) SARAH?
THIS IS DR. KING. I NEED
SECURITY DOWN HERE IMMEDIATELY.

25:02.041 --> 25:04.291
OH, MY GOD. SARAH?
HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAUGHTER?
THIS IS A CODE PINK NOW.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.542
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!
(Charlotte) MA'AM?

25:05.583 --> 25:06.750
(Ron) DANA.
SARAH!

25:06.792 --> 25:08.041
SARAH!

25:08.083 --> 25:09.542
SARAH, WHERE ARE YOU?!
(Ron) DANA. DANA.

25:09.583 --> 25:10.750
SARAH! OH, MY GOD! SARAH!

25:10.792 --> 25:12.041
NO! OH, MY GOD!
MA'AM, I NEED YOU TO--

25:12.083 --> 25:13.792
SARAH! NO! LET GO!

25:17.792 --> 25:20.083
(indistinct conversations,
police radio chatter)

25:20.125 --> 25:22.083
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE A LITTLE
GIRL IN A PURPLE RAINCOAT?

25:22.125 --> 25:24.458
WE'VE REGISTERED 30 PATIENTS
IN THE LAST 2 HOURS.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.041
I CAN'T POSSIBLY REMEMBER
ONE LITTLE GIRL.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.875
I DOUBLED THE STAFF OUT THERE.
HOW COULD YOU MISS HER?

25:29.917 --> 25:31.834
SAME WAY YOU DID, I GUESS.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.041
(Dana) I DON'T KNOW THAT A NURSE
WAS THERE.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.875
THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER.

25:34.917 --> 25:37.041
THE HOSPITAL'S LOCKED DOWN.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.041
SECURITY WILL SEARCH EVERY INCH
OF EVERY FLOOR.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.625
NOBODY WILL BE ABLE
TO LEAVE THE BUILDING

25:40.667 --> 25:42.458
WITHOUT BEING CHECKED.
AREN'T THERE...

25:42.500 --> 25:44.834
DON'T YOU HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS?
MAYBE THEY SAW HER WHEN SHE--

25:44.875 --> 25:46.041
THE VIDEO'S ALREADY
BEING REVIEWED.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.041
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING!

25:48.083 --> 25:51.041
DANA. DANA, THEY WILL FIND HER.
THEY WILL FIND HER.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.625
WHERE ARE THE O.R.s?

25:52.667 --> 25:54.542
UH, TURN RIGHT
AND TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO 5.

25:54.583 --> 25:56.000
WAIT. WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:04.041 --> 26:05.709
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
(film rattles)

26:05.750 --> 26:07.041
(Amelia) WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY O.R.?

26:07.083 --> 26:08.375
TODD REITER.
TRANSIENT WEAKNESS.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.000
YEAH, I TOLD YOU
TO SEND HIM HOME.

26:10.041 --> 26:12.208
YEAH, YOU DID.
LOOK AT THE FILM.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.417
DR. MALONE, YOU CLOSE.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.875
(grunts) I HATE YOU, TODD!

26:22.917 --> 26:24.250
I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE DOING SO GREAT.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.834
WE'RE NEVER HAVING SEX AGAIN.
(curtain rings swoosh)

26:26.875 --> 26:29.166
LATE DECELS ON THE MONITOR
WITH EVERY CONTRACTION.

26:29.208 --> 26:31.083
W-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS SOMETHING'S WRONG,
RIGHT?

26:31.125 --> 26:32.291
OKAY, PAM, LISTEN TO ME.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.500
THE BABY'S NOT GETTING
ENOUGH OXYGEN.

26:33.542 --> 26:35.041
WE NEED TO DO A C-SECTION
RIGHT NOW.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.917
CAN YOU CALL, UH--
I DID. O.R.s ARE FULL.

26:36.959 --> 26:38.458
LAST ONE'S BEING HELD
FOR AN EMERGENT E.R. CASE.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.041
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:40.083 --> 26:41.709
SETTING UP
FOR SPINAL ANESTHESIA.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.125
WE HAVE TO
DO THE DELIVERY HERE.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.208
HERE?! IN THE E.R.?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

26:45.250 --> 26:46.417
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.041
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.
(curtain rings swoosh)

26:48.083 --> 26:49.959
WE NEED TO TAKE TODD
UP TO SURGERY.
(Todd and Pam) WHAT?!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.417
HIS SYMPTOM'S
MORE THAN ANXIETY.

26:51.458 --> 26:52.542
(Amelia) YOU HAVE AN INFECTION
NEXT TO YOUR SPINAL CORD.

26:52.583 --> 26:54.041
WE NEED TO OPERATE NOW.
(Pam) NO!

26:54.083 --> 26:55.333
(Todd) I LOVE YOU, PAMMIE!
NO, WAIT!

26:55.375 --> 26:57.041
I LOVE YOU!
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

26:57.083 --> 26:59.125
TODD! (cries)

26:59.166 --> 27:02.166
(indistinct conversations)

27:03.959 --> 27:05.709
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.959
LITTLE GIRL. COOPER'S PATIENT.
SHE'S MISSING.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.041
(curtain rings swoosh)
(panting)

27:24.083 --> 27:25.709
YOU OKAY?

27:25.750 --> 27:29.500
YEAH. YEAH, I JUST...

27:29.542 --> 27:32.083
I WANTED TO
CHECK UP ON YOU. HMM.

27:32.125 --> 27:34.250
(exhales deeply)
HOW YOU FEELING?

27:34.291 --> 27:36.750
I'M GOOD.

27:36.792 --> 27:38.000
CAN I GO HOME?

27:39.458 --> 27:44.083
YEAH. YEAH, I HAVE YOUR, UH,
DISCHARGE PAPERS FOR YOU.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.125
HERE YOU GO. (sighs)

27:48.041 --> 27:50.000
(pen clicks)

27:52.125 --> 27:53.834
SO THEY CAN'T FIND
THAT LITTLE GIRL?

27:55.083 --> 27:57.500
I HEARD ALL THE NOISE.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.000
NO.

28:00.834 --> 28:04.000
NO, SHE'S STILL MISSING.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.208
(sighs)

28:08.250 --> 28:09.500
LOOK...

28:09.542 --> 28:10.792
I'M SORRY.

28:10.834 --> 28:14.041
ALL RIGHT? I WAS WORRIED.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.208
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THE MEDICATION ISN'T WORKING.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.959
YOU KNOW, AND IT--AND IT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT I-I DON'T--

28:18.000 --> 28:22.041
IT'S OKAY. I GET IT.

28:22.083 --> 28:23.875
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
IT WAS ME, TOO.

28:27.083 --> 28:30.000
(papers rustling)

28:30.041 --> 28:31.792
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

28:31.834 --> 28:35.041
YEAH.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.875
(voice breaking)
TODD'S GONNA MAKE IT, RIGHT?

28:36.917 --> 28:38.458
HANG IN THERE, PAM.
(suction gurgling)

28:38.500 --> 28:40.041
(exhales sharply)
I FEEL DIZZY.

28:40.083 --> 28:41.542
B.P.'s ONLY 70 PALP.

28:41.583 --> 28:44.417
THAT SPINAL BOLUS MUST'VE
BOTTOMED OUT HER PRESSURE.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.041
GIVE HER--
EPHEDRINE, 5 MILLIGRAMS.

28:46.083 --> 28:48.583
SLOW I.V. PUSH. GOING IN.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.041
I'LL RUN IN A FLUID BOLUS.

28:50.083 --> 28:51.875
WE CAN GET THIS BABY
OUT NOW.

28:51.917 --> 28:54.375
NEED AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS?
YEAH. THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

28:54.417 --> 28:56.041
MUST'VE BEEN
A UTERINE ARTERY LACERATION.

28:56.083 --> 28:57.208
OKAY, SUCTION.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.583
OH VICRYL.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.875
I'M GONNA HAND-TIE
THE VESSEL.

29:00.917 --> 29:02.417
PRESSURE'S STILL DOWN.

29:02.458 --> 29:03.875
COME ON, BABY. BREATHE.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.000
OKAY, GOT IT.
BLEEDING HAS STOPPED.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.083
PAM'S PRESSURE'S COMING UP.

29:07.125 --> 29:09.041
(weakly) WHAT'S HAPPENING?

29:09.083 --> 29:10.792
COME ON, BREATHE. BREATHE.

29:10.834 --> 29:12.291
WHAT'S WRONG? IS MY BABY OKAY?

29:12.333 --> 29:16.041
(baby crying)
THAT'S A GIRL! GOOD GIRL!

29:16.083 --> 29:17.041
(gasps) A GIRL?

29:17.083 --> 29:18.917
(voice breaks) WE HAVE A GIRL?

29:18.959 --> 29:21.083
(laughs)

29:21.125 --> 29:23.458
(sniffles)

29:23.500 --> 29:26.917
(sobbing)

29:29.083 --> 29:30.500
I GOT IT.

29:30.542 --> 29:33.458
(continues sobbing)

29:33.500 --> 29:35.750
(continues crying)

29:35.792 --> 29:37.458
(speaks indistinctly)

29:37.500 --> 29:40.500
(continues sobbing)
IT'S OKAY. COME ON.

29:42.083 --> 29:43.041
(curtain rings swoosh)

29:53.625 --> 29:55.792
HEY.

29:55.834 --> 29:57.041
(whispers) YEAH.

29:57.083 --> 29:58.166
YOU OKAY?

29:58.208 --> 30:00.667
YEAH. YOU GUYS HAVE
A LOT MORE CHANNELS HERE

30:00.709 --> 30:02.000
THAN WE DO AT HOME.

30:04.166 --> 30:06.125
COME HERE.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.250
(clears throat)
(grunts)

30:08.291 --> 30:10.333
MM.
(strained voice)
WHAT--WHAT'S WRONG?

30:10.375 --> 30:12.917
CAN'T A FATHER
GIVE A SON A HUG?

30:12.959 --> 30:14.041
(grunts)

30:14.083 --> 30:15.875
I CAN'T BREATHE.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.500
(laughs and kisses)

30:22.709 --> 30:25.500
(sighs) SOMETHING HAPPENED,
DIDN'T IT?

30:28.125 --> 30:30.542
MY... PATIENT,
THAT LITTLE GIRL--

30:30.583 --> 30:33.709
SHE, UM... IS MISSING
FROM THE E.R.

30:33.750 --> 30:37.041
YOU WANT ME TO HELP
LOOK FOR HER?

30:38.750 --> 30:39.959
WE CAN LOOK TOGETHER.

30:47.083 --> 30:49.291
(indistinct conversations)

30:49.333 --> 30:51.417
OH, STEPHANIE.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.709
I'M BUSY.
WHOA. WAIT. HOLD UP.
STEPH, WAIT.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.041
LET ME EXPLAIN MYSELF.

30:55.083 --> 30:56.333
OKAY.
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

30:56.375 --> 31:00.000
ALL RIGHT. UH...

31:03.083 --> 31:05.250
UGH. SAVE IT, SAM.
I'M WORKING.
S-STEPHANIE.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.959
HEY. D--UM, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP WITH PAM.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.041
DID AN O.R. OPEN UP
FOR MEGAN?

31:12.083 --> 31:13.166
I'M HEADED OVER THERE NOW.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.458
JAKE, HOW MANY MORE TIMES

31:14.500 --> 31:15.667
ARE YOU GONNA LET HER
GO THROUGH THIS?

31:15.709 --> 31:17.041
I MEAN, YOU SAW HER.
SHE'S DEVASTATED.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.875
AND EVERY TIME,
IT'S JUST GONNA GET WORSE.

31:18.917 --> 31:21.041
YOU DON'T KNOW MEGAN,
ALL RIGHT? I DO.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.041
MEGAN AND DANNY HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT FOR YEARS.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.250
MET WITH EVERY FERTILITY DOCTOR
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

31:25.291 --> 31:27.125
WHO ALL SAID
IT WAS A LONG SHOT.

31:27.166 --> 31:28.667
I TOLD THEM
I LIKE A LONG SHOT,

31:28.709 --> 31:30.500
SO THEY MOVED HERE
BECAUSE OF ME.

31:30.542 --> 31:32.208
YEAH, BUT SOME WOMEN
JUST CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.625
NOT IF YOU GIVE UP ON THEM.

31:33.667 --> 31:35.375
I DON'T GIVE UP ON MY PATIENTS,
BUT THIS IS INSANE

31:35.417 --> 31:38.041
BECAUSE YOU ARE
PLAYING THE ODDS WAY TOO FAR

31:38.083 --> 31:39.709
IN FAVOR OF DOING
MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD,

31:39.750 --> 31:41.792
AND YOUR PATIENT IS THE ONE
WHO WILL SUFFER.

31:41.834 --> 31:43.875
LOOK, ADDISON, YOU MAY
BE VERY GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO,

31:43.917 --> 31:45.667
BUT I AM EXCELLENT
AT WHAT I DO--

31:45.709 --> 31:47.375
ONE OF THE BEST
IN THE COUNTRY.

31:47.417 --> 31:48.834
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
FOR YOUR OPINION,

31:48.875 --> 31:50.667
AND I DON'T WANT IT.

31:55.458 --> 31:58.458
(indistinct conversations)

32:05.500 --> 32:06.667
HOW THEY DOING?

32:06.709 --> 32:08.208
HOW WOULD YOU BE?

32:08.250 --> 32:10.542
I JUST GAVE DANA A SEDATIVE,
BUT RON DIDN'T WANT ONE.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.083
HE WANTS TO STAY CLEAR.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.291
I'M PUTTING A G.P.S. ON MASON
FOR REALS.

32:14.333 --> 32:18.041
I KNOW. I JUST CALLED THE NANNY
THREE TIMES, CHECKING ON LUCAS.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.917
(Cooper scoffs)

32:19.959 --> 32:21.625
THIS NEW GUY'S A DOUCHE.

32:21.667 --> 32:22.834
HE'S JUST DOING HIS JOB.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.250
WELL, PETE DID IT BETTER.

32:25.709 --> 32:28.041
YOU OKAY?

32:28.083 --> 32:30.208
WELL, I'M THE ONE
WHO TOLD CHARLOTTE

32:30.250 --> 32:32.125
TO HIRE HIS REPLACEMENT.

32:32.166 --> 32:35.041
I CAN'T VERY WELL
GET MAD AT HER FOR DOING IT.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.041
BUT NOW, I MEAN, I...

32:37.083 --> 32:39.000
SEEING HIM HERE,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME...

32:42.083 --> 32:43.959
(voice breaks)
HE SHOULD BE PETE.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.291
HEY. ANY NEWS ABOUT
THE MISSING GIRL?

32:46.333 --> 32:48.500
(sighs) NO. SECURITY'S STILL
SEARCHING THE BUILDING.

32:48.542 --> 32:50.709
HEY, I HEARD YOU MADE
A PRETTY SLICK DIAGNOSIS.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.333
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:52.375 --> 32:53.542
THE EPIDURAL ABSCESS

32:53.583 --> 32:55.875
WITH PROGRESSED
NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS?

32:55.917 --> 32:57.041
JAMES TOLD ME,
IN A COUPLE HOURS,

32:57.083 --> 32:58.750
THE PATIENT WOULD'VE NEVER
WALK AGAIN.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.792
SOUNDS LIKE
A ONE-IN-A-MILLION CATCH.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.750
DR. KING,
MAY I TALK TO YOU?

33:09.291 --> 33:12.291
(indistinct conversations
continue)

33:20.625 --> 33:23.500
(sighs) IT STOPPED RAINING.
THAT'S GOOD.

33:23.542 --> 33:24.792
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

33:24.834 --> 33:27.083
MAYBE SARAH GOT SCARED
BY THE THUNDER.

33:27.125 --> 33:30.041
YOU KNOW, SHE COULD--
SHE COULD BE HIDING. RIGHT?

33:30.083 --> 33:31.083
SHE COULD, YEAH.

33:31.125 --> 33:32.375
(Ron breathing heavily)

33:32.417 --> 33:33.834
THAT'S--T-THAT'S SARAH'S.

33:33.875 --> 33:36.083
I'M SORRY, MA'AM,
IT'S--IT'S EVIDENCE.

33:36.125 --> 33:37.500
IT NEEDS TO BE PROCESSED.

33:37.542 --> 33:38.917
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

33:38.959 --> 33:40.709
IT WAS ON A BENCH OUT FRONT.

33:40.750 --> 33:41.959
YOU--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.500
YOU FOUND IT OUTSIDE?
W-WHAT ABOUT SARAH?

33:43.542 --> 33:47.041
I'M SORRY. SHE'S NOT HERE.

33:47.083 --> 33:50.250
SECURITY'S TURNED THE CASE OVER
TO THE POLICE.

33:50.291 --> 33:52.959
AS OF NOW,
SARAH IS A MISSING PERSON.
