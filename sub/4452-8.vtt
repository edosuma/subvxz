00:00.865 --> 00:02.024
Previously on Cedar Cove...

00:02.025 --> 00:03.064
- Hello there!
- Gloria.

00:03.194 --> 00:05.412
- You look familiar.
- I was sheriff outside of Seattle.

00:05.507 --> 00:06.546
I just transferred in.

00:06.547 --> 00:09.603
I'm firing Jeri, and I'm
officially offering you her job.

00:10.131 --> 00:11.148
Oh, hey, I'm Alex.

00:11.148 --> 00:12.981
Hi! Uh, Paul. Watson.

00:13.574 --> 00:15.284
Hey sis, I don't have any place to live.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:25.039 --> 00:25.971
Here you go.

00:26.001 --> 00:28.168
- Breakfast was delicious.
- Aw, thank you.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.671
My kitchen has missed you.

00:30.673 --> 00:32.873
I have missed it too.

00:34.443 --> 00:36.276
You don't have any milk.

00:37.513 --> 00:38.512
Will.

00:38.514 --> 00:39.980
I have milk.

00:39.982 --> 00:41.648
2%. I drink skim milk.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.117
Hey, it's okay.

00:43.119 --> 00:44.451
You can pick some up after work.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.003
I could, but so could you.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.005
Well, I would love to,
but I am slammed today.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.356
Ah...

00:49.358 --> 00:51.225
what's on your... "slammed" agenda today?

00:51.227 --> 00:52.526
Tennis.

00:52.528 --> 00:53.861
According to my partner,

00:53.863 --> 00:54.495
we're still looking for a fourth.

00:54.497 --> 00:55.879
It's Wednesday.

00:55.881 --> 00:56.797
Yeah, I know.

00:56.799 --> 00:58.031
I have to work.

00:58.033 --> 00:59.016
Olivia?

00:59.018 --> 01:00.100
I have court.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.401
Well, I have court, too.

01:01.403 --> 01:02.436
Get it?

01:02.438 --> 01:03.904
We get it.

01:03.906 --> 01:04.872
I got more.

01:04.873 --> 01:06.073
Keep going if you... No?

01:06.075 --> 01:07.341
Good? Okay.

01:07.343 --> 01:08.308
Have fun, Will.

01:08.310 --> 01:10.010
See ya!

01:11.113 --> 01:13.063
At least somebody's amused.

01:13.065 --> 01:16.016
I cannot believe you two are related.

01:16.018 --> 01:16.700
Oh, it's not his fault,

01:16.702 --> 01:18.051
or not all his fault.

01:18.053 --> 01:19.586
It's my mother's,

01:19.588 --> 01:20.971
and every girlfriend
that he's ever been with,

01:20.973 --> 01:22.222
and his ex-wife.

01:22.224 --> 01:23.857
Will has never had to do for himself.

01:23.859 --> 01:25.859
He always found somebody to do for him.

01:25.861 --> 01:28.212
Is that someone now you?

01:28.214 --> 01:29.930
No.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.032
No.

01:32.034 --> 01:32.933
Mm-hmm.

01:32.935 --> 01:34.735
And yet, here he is,

01:34.737 --> 01:36.436
with seemingly no intention

01:36.438 --> 01:39.773
of buying milk or leaving any time soon.

01:39.775 --> 01:41.041
Will just needs to learn

01:41.043 --> 01:42.426
to take responsibility for himself.

01:42.428 --> 01:44.411
So you are going to do

01:44.413 --> 01:45.846
what no woman has ever done before...

01:45.848 --> 01:47.564
change Will.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.650
I don't want to change him.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.718
I just want him to learn
how to be responsible.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.221
Ideally, responsible at another address.

01:54.223 --> 01:56.156
Ideally.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.574
Ah, well...

01:57.576 --> 01:58.692
time to face the music.

01:58.694 --> 02:00.160
Your meeting at the Courier?

02:00.162 --> 02:02.512
With my boss, yes.

02:02.514 --> 02:03.797
I have to try and persuade him

02:03.799 --> 02:06.133
to change his mind about firing Jeri.

02:06.135 --> 02:08.235
I love your loyalty,

02:08.237 --> 02:10.370
but is this a fight you
really want to take on?

02:10.372 --> 02:11.588
I have to.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.606
No, you don't.

02:12.608 --> 02:13.507
No, I do.

02:13.509 --> 02:14.725
I can't help feel

02:14.727 --> 02:15.676
that if I hadn't gone to that meeting

02:15.678 --> 02:17.311
with Jeri in Seattle,

02:17.313 --> 02:18.145
the owner never would have gotten the idea

02:18.147 --> 02:19.479
to give me her job.

02:19.481 --> 02:21.715
You haven't done anything wrong.

02:23.085 --> 02:24.518
I know.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.886
Still, it doesn't mean that I shouldn't try

02:25.888 --> 02:27.571
to make things right.

02:28.958 --> 02:29.606
Anyway...

02:29.608 --> 02:31.625
Have a great day.

02:32.494 --> 02:33.627
Talk to you later.

02:42.238 --> 02:44.087
Look, just a touch of skim milk, please.

02:44.089 --> 02:45.622
Got it.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.892
One coffee with a drop of
thin-lady milk coming up.

02:50.412 --> 02:51.912
Moon, you're not by any
chance a baseball fan, are you?

02:51.914 --> 02:55.666
Uh, I like a little
more blood in my sports.

02:55.668 --> 02:57.501
I've got two tickets to
the Mariners' game tomorrow,

02:57.503 --> 02:59.086
and I don't want the extra
ticket to go to waste.

02:59.088 --> 03:00.637
A Mariners fan?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.689
Well, actually, Yankees.

03:03.859 --> 03:05.792
What?

03:05.794 --> 03:07.160
I don't know.

03:07.162 --> 03:08.679
You don't seem like your
average baseball fan.

03:08.681 --> 03:10.430
Really?

03:10.432 --> 03:11.148
What gave me away?

03:11.150 --> 03:13.116
Your amazing heels.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.736
You're quick.

03:15.738 --> 03:16.737
Thanks.

03:16.739 --> 03:18.071
Should see how fast I am

03:18.073 --> 03:19.423
without my foot in my mouth.

03:19.425 --> 03:20.507
Well, do you like baseball?

03:20.509 --> 03:21.808
I do.

03:21.810 --> 03:22.943
I've got two tickets to the Mariners game.

03:22.945 --> 03:23.944
Do you want to go?

03:23.946 --> 03:26.947
Sure! That'd be great.

03:26.949 --> 03:27.831
Okay. Here's my card.

03:27.833 --> 03:28.715
Call me.

03:28.717 --> 03:30.634
Thanks.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.386
Thanks, Moon. Keep the change.

03:32.388 --> 03:33.303
Thank you.

03:33.305 --> 03:34.988
- See ya.
- See ya.

03:36.859 --> 03:38.525
You are smooth.

03:38.527 --> 03:39.710
What, me?

03:39.712 --> 03:41.962
Well, you just got yourself a date.

03:43.766 --> 03:44.815
I did?

03:58.418 --> 04:00.136
Synced and Corrected by Nsiko
www.Addic7ed.com

04:03.168 --> 04:04.668
I heard from an unnamed source

04:04.670 --> 04:06.920
that you sold your share
of Charlotte's house

04:06.922 --> 04:08.088
to Buck?

04:08.090 --> 04:10.357
And before you even say anything,

04:10.359 --> 04:12.943
you need to know I bet Cliff a foot rub

04:12.945 --> 04:14.027
that he was wrong.

04:14.029 --> 04:15.462
Well, he's right,

04:15.464 --> 04:17.414
and you are terrible at
protecting your source.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.216
Darn it.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.434
Love the man...

04:20.435 --> 04:22.035
not the feet.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.187
I thought you were going
to fight him to the death

04:24.189 --> 04:25.739
to keep that house?

04:25.741 --> 04:27.124
So did I.

04:27.126 --> 04:28.375
But?

04:28.377 --> 04:29.843
I was trying to hold on to something

04:29.845 --> 04:31.345
that you can't hold onto...

04:31.347 --> 04:32.362
Memories.

04:32.364 --> 04:33.647
That's why Mom gave it to us.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.115
It's time to let it go.

04:37.836 --> 04:40.587
So... you sold your half to Buck?

04:40.589 --> 04:41.888
I did...

04:41.890 --> 04:44.491
not to Saget Developments,
but to your father.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.728
Just in case Buck ever gives you
any power in the company again,

04:47.730 --> 04:48.962
my mother's house

04:48.964 --> 04:51.598
remains safely in your father's hands.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.534
That is so... incredibly... disloyal.

04:55.404 --> 04:56.258
What?

04:56.258 --> 04:58.372
What? You wouldn't sell
to your own brother,

04:58.374 --> 04:59.589
but you're gonna go ahead
and sell to my father?

04:59.591 --> 05:00.924
I didn't sell to Will

05:00.926 --> 05:02.476
because he was in business with you,

05:02.478 --> 05:03.777
and he sold to you

05:03.779 --> 05:05.612
without so much as a phone call to me.

05:05.614 --> 05:07.280
All right, look.

05:07.282 --> 05:09.583
It's not too late, okay?
You can rescind your offer.

05:09.585 --> 05:10.751
I already signed the papers.

05:10.753 --> 05:11.968
So?

05:11.970 --> 05:12.803
Money hasn't changed hands. You're fine.

05:12.805 --> 05:14.488
Buck sent good faith money

05:14.490 --> 05:15.856
before I signed the papers.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.658
Olivia, Buck is going
to cut up all that land,

05:18.660 --> 05:20.976
and he's going to sell it off,
just like I was going to do,

05:20.976 --> 05:22.005
and you know it.

05:22.179 --> 05:23.730
He signed an affidavit

05:23.732 --> 05:28.034
guaranteeing the land would
be protected in perpetuity.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.453
It will never be developed.

05:29.455 --> 05:32.339
Now, if you will shut the door

05:32.341 --> 05:35.058
after you walk through it,

05:35.060 --> 05:36.993
that would be nice.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.912
Or I can call my bailiff.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.316
Right.

05:43.318 --> 05:45.519
So you fought a Saget with a Saget.

05:45.521 --> 05:46.887
I did.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.358
I didn't think you had it in you.

05:48.542 --> 05:49.626
I do.

05:51.026 --> 05:52.717
I bet you're loving this, aren't you?

05:53.298 --> 05:54.928
I'm not hating it.

06:08.444 --> 06:11.311
Well, looks like everyone's
a winner but me...

06:11.313 --> 06:12.446
oh, and Warren.

06:13.298 --> 06:15.081
Stinky cowboy feet.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.800
So now that you have bested Warren

06:16.802 --> 06:18.301
and you have cleared up the gossip...

06:18.303 --> 06:20.070
you need to help me find a new venue

06:20.072 --> 06:22.756
for the Second Hand Swap.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.074
The Second Hand Swap?

06:24.076 --> 06:25.225
You know, it's where people bring in things

06:25.227 --> 06:27.177
that they can't sell or give away

06:27.179 --> 06:28.845
and they swap them with
other people's stuff

06:28.847 --> 06:30.931
that they can't sell or give away.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.816
It's a big community builder.

06:32.818 --> 06:34.401
Covers love a good swap.

06:35.504 --> 06:36.870
We have more than one swap?

06:36.872 --> 06:39.523
Book swap! Craft swap! Garden swap!

06:39.525 --> 06:40.974
How do you swap a garden?

06:40.976 --> 06:42.676
Seeds and flowers.

06:42.678 --> 06:43.777
Oh!

06:43.779 --> 06:44.978
Where have you been?

06:44.980 --> 06:45.996
Here.

06:45.998 --> 06:47.747
No, you haven't been here

06:47.749 --> 06:50.467
until you've been to the
Cedar Cove garden swap.

06:50.469 --> 06:51.918
Jennings,

06:51.920 --> 06:53.353
I need the recommendations
for the Halicky case,

06:53.355 --> 06:54.271
like, yesterday.

06:54.273 --> 06:55.655
The defense lawyer...

06:59.127 --> 07:00.544
Rebecca.

07:06.785 --> 07:08.168
I didn't hear you come in.

07:08.170 --> 07:09.719
Probably because you were asleep.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.137
I wasn't asleep.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.506
That's odd.

07:12.508 --> 07:13.356
I've spent the last
minute trying to wake you.

07:13.358 --> 07:15.642
I highly doubt that.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.278
Look, if the Miller case is too much,

07:18.280 --> 07:20.030
there is no shame in standing down.

07:20.032 --> 07:21.515
You don't need to worry.

07:21.517 --> 07:22.632
I've got it handled.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.985
It is a big, complicated case.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.353
I hit every deadline

07:26.355 --> 07:28.371
and given you no reason
to take me off this case.

07:28.373 --> 07:30.340
Except me catching you asleep on the job,

07:30.342 --> 07:31.541
which is cause for concern.

07:31.543 --> 07:32.809
Okay...

07:32.811 --> 07:34.427
I came to work really early today.

07:34.429 --> 07:37.230
I may have shut my eyes for a second.

07:37.232 --> 07:39.132
But trust me, it won't happen again.

07:41.036 --> 07:42.752
Okay.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.204
We will do this your way.

07:44.206 --> 07:46.973
Remember, you are on probation.

07:46.975 --> 07:48.608
If this case is not handled properly,

07:48.610 --> 07:50.243
you will be out of a job.

07:50.245 --> 07:52.712
Are you sure you don't want to stand down?

07:52.714 --> 07:54.714
Absolutely sure.

07:56.885 --> 07:58.685
Okay.

08:05.928 --> 08:07.928
Hey, sis.

08:07.930 --> 08:11.131
We won. Three out of four sets.

08:11.133 --> 08:14.534
I... am... exhausted.

08:18.890 --> 08:19.973
Oh, I forgot my key.

08:24.663 --> 08:25.412
Thank you.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.214
What are your plans?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.349
Well, I thought I'd go home,

08:29.351 --> 08:30.317
take a nice, long, hot shower...

08:30.319 --> 08:31.851
probably get some lunch.

08:31.853 --> 08:34.187
Justine is coming over
later to look at some specs

08:34.188 --> 08:35.655
for a potential property.

08:35.657 --> 08:36.873
Why? What are you doing?
Want to join me for lunch?

08:36.875 --> 08:37.890
I have to work.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.592
Right.

08:39.595 --> 08:42.395
I was talking more about,
you know, your larger plan...

08:42.397 --> 08:44.364
your living situation...

08:44.366 --> 08:46.283
our living situation.

08:46.285 --> 08:47.167
Got it.

08:47.169 --> 08:48.635
You want to know

08:48.637 --> 08:50.136
how long your brother's
going to be hanging around.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.571
But this is great, right?

08:51.573 --> 08:52.939
Living together?

08:52.941 --> 08:54.107
I mean,

08:54.109 --> 08:55.709
it's like we really have a chance

08:55.711 --> 08:58.545
to get to know each other all over again.

09:01.383 --> 09:03.783
If you're going to be living with me...

09:05.821 --> 09:08.121
you're going to have to
help around the house.

09:08.123 --> 09:10.140
Pull my own weight? You bet.

09:10.142 --> 09:11.308
Okay!

09:11.310 --> 09:14.027
Put me to work, please.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.409
Man, you're getting soft.

09:29.411 --> 09:31.111
Nobody kicking your butt anymore.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.746
Yeah.

09:32.748 --> 09:34.097
So how's group?

09:34.099 --> 09:35.965
Yeah, I like it.

09:35.967 --> 09:37.717
Yeah? Any plans to see Missy?

09:37.719 --> 09:38.885
Next weekend.

09:38.887 --> 09:40.303
She's going to bring Julie too.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.822
I don't know how you do it.

09:42.824 --> 09:43.823
What, marriage?

09:43.825 --> 09:46.326
No. Family.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.161
You'll find out one day.

09:48.163 --> 09:50.263
Nope. I'm not having kids.

09:50.265 --> 09:52.132
Justine know that?

09:52.134 --> 09:53.633
Well, we haven't talked about it.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.902
What, you don't think that's a big thing?

09:55.904 --> 09:58.121
We just started dating.

09:58.123 --> 09:59.489
I don't know... with Missy,

09:59.491 --> 10:00.707
it was, like, third date

10:00.709 --> 10:02.726
she started talking about kids.

10:09.751 --> 10:12.702
Is Jeri abrasive? Yes.

10:12.704 --> 10:15.205
Does she rub people the wrong way?

10:15.207 --> 10:16.056
Sometimes.

10:17.642 --> 10:19.576
Okay... oftentimes.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.695
Once you get to know her, all right,

10:21.697 --> 10:24.881
she is... abrasive,

10:24.883 --> 10:27.567
but she's also honest and fair,

10:27.569 --> 10:28.902
and those are two traits

10:28.904 --> 10:31.187
that I find sorely
lacking in our business...

10:31.189 --> 10:32.372
in a lot of business.

10:32.374 --> 10:35.375
I appreciate your loyalty to Jeri.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.010
Just makes me want to promote you more.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.096
And I appreciate what Jeri did.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.381
She stepped in

10:41.383 --> 10:42.449
at a difficult time at the paper

10:42.451 --> 10:43.712
and righted the ship.

10:43.892 --> 10:47.202
But I no longer need someone
to lead with an iron fist.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.246
I need...

10:50.248 --> 10:52.749
well, I need someone else.

10:52.751 --> 10:53.800
I need you.

10:55.187 --> 10:58.738
I don't think loyalty to a colleague

10:58.740 --> 11:00.773
is the only thing giving you pause.

11:02.327 --> 11:04.127
Look, David...

11:05.464 --> 11:07.147
I'm a reporter.

11:07.149 --> 11:09.399
It's in my blood.

11:09.401 --> 11:11.534
And management has to make concessions,

11:11.536 --> 11:12.952
and I don't want to make those concessions

11:12.954 --> 11:14.671
if it means that I can't write the story

11:14.673 --> 11:16.973
that I want to write... or have to.

11:16.975 --> 11:21.778
You have an authentic
voice, unique and strong.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.138
I want you to take the
Courier to the next level.

11:24.796 --> 11:26.169
I won't stand in your way.

11:33.283 --> 11:34.861
I'll give you until the end of the day,

11:34.861 --> 11:37.710
then, loyalty or not, I'll have to move on.

11:41.316 --> 11:43.900
I hope to hear from you soon.

12:02.025 --> 12:02.962
Hey.

12:04.269 --> 12:04.980
Yes?

12:06.066 --> 12:07.199
What did I do to you?

12:07.201 --> 12:08.917
Huh?

12:08.919 --> 12:10.368
I know it's you.

12:10.370 --> 12:11.787
What are you talking about?

12:11.789 --> 12:14.076
I heard from my old landlord in Seattle.

12:15.392 --> 12:17.275
Someone's been asking questions about me.

12:17.277 --> 12:18.443
Well, it wasn't me.

12:18.445 --> 12:19.745
I don't believe you.

12:19.747 --> 12:21.129
Says the woman with the fake I.D.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.848
It's not fake.

12:22.850 --> 12:25.100
It is, and so are you.

12:25.102 --> 12:26.265
And I checked.

12:26.358 --> 12:28.176
You aren't working for
the sheriff's department.

12:28.355 --> 12:29.768
They've never heard of you.

12:29.962 --> 12:31.339
I didn't say I was working.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.108
I said I wanted to work.

12:33.110 --> 12:35.677
I know what you said.

12:35.679 --> 12:36.728
And I've got court.

12:46.924 --> 12:47.727
Thanks.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.492
I'll have a notarized copy
for you in the morning.

12:49.493 --> 12:50.575
I like your efficiency.

12:50.577 --> 12:51.910
I don't like wasting time.

12:51.912 --> 12:53.161
We have similar styles.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.217
I don't know about that.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.694
Well, we both like to get things done,

12:55.885 --> 12:57.042
and we don't suffer fools.

12:57.456 --> 12:59.291
I'd love to find a
place for you on my team.

12:59.450 --> 13:02.016
I'm going back to school
to get my Master's in social work,

13:02.338 --> 13:03.254
but thanks.

13:03.255 --> 13:04.699
Altruistic as well. Nice touch.

13:08.186 --> 13:10.008
Hi, Justine. Hope you're
leaving on my account.

13:10.053 --> 13:11.893
Oh, by the way, there's no
need to keep stopping by.

13:12.046 --> 13:13.320
Okay, bye-bye.

13:13.871 --> 13:15.231
You shouldn't have let that one get away.

13:16.978 --> 13:18.666
- Man, you're a piece of work.
- Me?

13:18.830 --> 13:20.281
- You took me fishing.
- I did.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.733
Had to get me away from the office.

13:21.733 --> 13:22.984
No, to spend time with you.

13:22.984 --> 13:24.233
Yeah, right, Dad, spend time...

13:24.235 --> 13:25.318
You wanted that house so bad,

13:25.320 --> 13:26.869
you knew the only way
you were going to get it

13:26.871 --> 13:28.927
was to steal it from me behind my back,

13:29.073 --> 13:31.206
and then, what, send me off to
some lake wearing stupid clothes?

13:31.209 --> 13:32.608
I don't work that way. You do.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.776
Excuse me?

13:33.778 --> 13:34.894
You made some sort of back-room deal

13:34.896 --> 13:36.062
with Will Jeffers.

13:36.064 --> 13:37.029
You did the same thing with Justine.

13:37.031 --> 13:38.397
Justine came to me.

13:38.399 --> 13:39.699
Oh, right, she came to you.

13:39.701 --> 13:41.117
She didn't like the idea

13:41.119 --> 13:42.435
of what you had planned
for the land and the house.

13:42.437 --> 13:43.552
I don't like it either.

13:43.554 --> 13:44.971
So I went to Olivia with an offer.

13:44.973 --> 13:46.439
She liked my plan better than yours.

13:46.441 --> 13:47.857
Really?

13:47.859 --> 13:49.408
I'm really interested to know

13:49.410 --> 13:50.242
when you're going to break it to Olivia

13:50.244 --> 13:51.677
that you lied to her, Dad,

13:51.679 --> 13:52.878
and you're actually
going to develop the land,

13:52.880 --> 13:53.796
which is exactly what I was going to do!

13:53.798 --> 13:55.264
When you do that,

13:55.266 --> 13:56.265
I want to be there enjoying the moment.

13:56.267 --> 13:57.366
No.

13:57.368 --> 13:58.901
I'm going to live there, Warren...

13:58.903 --> 14:00.870
make Cedar Cove my home.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.556
Instead of New York?

14:03.558 --> 14:05.257
Warren Buffet lives in Nebraska.

14:06.444 --> 14:08.194
Come on, let's not fight.

14:08.196 --> 14:11.319
I'll buy you out with a very generous
offer and we can both move on.

14:11.483 --> 14:12.548
You know, Dad...

14:12.550 --> 14:15.584
if you really think that I'm just going
to hand over Charlotte's house to you,

14:15.586 --> 14:16.702
guess again.

14:18.619 --> 14:20.290
Charlotte's house is over.

14:21.474 --> 14:23.892
Now, the sooner you move on,
the better it'll be for you.

14:24.054 --> 14:25.184
So, what are you doing right now?

14:25.283 --> 14:27.513
- You're only thinking about me?
- Yes.

14:27.515 --> 14:28.614
Lucky me.

14:35.807 --> 14:37.890
Thank you.

14:39.227 --> 14:40.760
Hey.

14:40.762 --> 14:42.028
Hi!

14:42.030 --> 14:43.245
Hi. Glad I found you. I wanted to ask...

14:43.247 --> 14:45.247
did you reschedule the Dunn hearing?

14:45.249 --> 14:47.383
It was set for last on the docket tomorrow.

14:47.385 --> 14:49.935
I granted defense a continuance.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.737
Good. I wanted to get out early.

14:51.739 --> 14:52.988
Big plans?

14:52.990 --> 14:53.823
Ah, ticket to a Mariners' game.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.157
Fun! With who?

14:55.159 --> 14:56.609
Alex invited me.

14:58.012 --> 14:59.178
Why are you smiling?

14:59.180 --> 15:00.680
That's great.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.765
Yeah, that I'm going to a baseball game?

15:02.767 --> 15:04.183
Yeah, it's your first date in Cedar Cove.

15:04.185 --> 15:07.486
Nah, I'm going to the
game with Alex's ticket.

15:07.488 --> 15:09.588
That's what I said. A date.

15:09.590 --> 15:10.790
No! It's not a date.

15:10.792 --> 15:12.341
I bumped into her at Moon's.

15:12.343 --> 15:13.542
She didn't want the extra
ticket to go to waste.

15:13.544 --> 15:15.061
Ah. How are you getting there?

15:15.063 --> 15:16.062
She's picking me up.

15:16.064 --> 15:17.730
Are you friends?

15:17.732 --> 15:19.138
No... not really.

15:19.476 --> 15:21.670
- Paul...
- Olivia...

15:22.822 --> 15:25.239
She asked you to the game,
she's picking you up...

15:25.241 --> 15:27.792
if it looks like a duck,
quacks like a duck...

15:27.794 --> 15:28.910
It's a date.

15:28.912 --> 15:29.994
It is.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.145
I might not be able to go.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.313
Why?

15:32.315 --> 15:33.931
I have to... do my taxes.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.900
It's the end of the summer.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.668
I filed an extension.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.753
Wow...

15:39.706 --> 15:40.872
What?

15:40.874 --> 15:42.507
I can actually see your nose growing.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.009
What's the matter? She's nice.

15:45.011 --> 15:45.860
Yeah.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.578
It's one date.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.846
Are you afraid

15:48.848 --> 15:51.549
to go on one teeny, tiny date?

15:51.551 --> 15:54.018
Are you daring me to go out?

15:54.020 --> 15:55.553
Yeah.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.021
Well, I'm not one to back down from a dare,

15:57.023 --> 15:58.322
so...

15:58.324 --> 15:59.707
Fine.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.926
I will go out, with Alex, on a date.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.011
But if it goes poorly,

16:04.013 --> 16:05.646
I'm blaming you.

16:05.648 --> 16:08.983
I think you're more afraid
that it's going to go well.

16:08.985 --> 16:09.817
Yeah?

16:09.819 --> 16:11.536
Yeah!

16:18.261 --> 16:21.896
Have you seen my glasses?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.247
They're on your head.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.737
Rebecca couldn't find her glasses.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.090
They're on your head.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.658
Thank you for that.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.261
Rebecca, are you okay?

16:37.263 --> 16:40.431
Seems like you haven't been sleeping much.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.616
And you're cranky...

16:41.618 --> 16:44.619
Or... more cranky than usual.

16:44.621 --> 16:45.503
I'm fine.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.671
I have a huge case,

16:46.673 --> 16:48.005
and I've had to put in extra hours,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.007
but I'm an attorney.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.477
This is
the life I've signed up for.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.078
Okay.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.030
Well, I work in a
hospital, and I can tell you

16:56.032 --> 16:57.415
that sleep deprivation

16:57.417 --> 16:59.851
is the leading cause of accidents.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.052
It's worse than drunk driving.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.821
Thank you for that bit of trivia,

17:03.823 --> 17:05.406
but I've got it covered.

17:05.407 --> 17:07.290
Okay, and I'm also cranky

17:07.292 --> 17:10.394
because your little friend Gloria

17:10.396 --> 17:12.329
showed up at the courthouse today.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.965
Thank you for giving me
my own private stalker,

17:14.968 --> 17:16.000
by the way.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.335
Call your dad.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.219
I did.

17:18.221 --> 17:19.337
And?

17:19.339 --> 17:22.272
He was kind of cryptic, but he said

17:22.275 --> 17:24.075
we should stay away from Gloria

17:24.077 --> 17:25.943
until he gets back into town.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.244
Did he say why?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.980
Unless Gloria is
an 80-year-old woman

17:28.982 --> 17:30.131
who died last year,

17:30.133 --> 17:32.567
he said Gloria is not her real name.

17:32.569 --> 17:34.652
He thinks that she's
stolen someone's identity.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.738
Okay, no more being friendly to Gloria,

17:37.740 --> 17:38.823
or whoever she is.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.842
That's just it...

17:40.844 --> 17:42.226
who is she?

17:54.858 --> 17:55.690
Jeri...

17:55.692 --> 17:56.824
I spoke to David.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.609
He'd already made his decision.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.077
There was nothing else I could do.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.329
But you should least have the nerve

18:01.331 --> 18:02.346
to be straight with me.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.548
I deserve that much.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.184
Jeri, I didn't orchestrate your exit.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.485
I haven't even accepted the position.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.737
Well, you have to turn it down.

18:09.739 --> 18:12.290
You owe me. And I'm here to collect.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.342
You have to be joking.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.643
I'm serious.

18:15.645 --> 18:17.311
Well, you're seriously nuts

18:17.313 --> 18:19.096
if you think I have to turn this down

18:19.098 --> 18:21.082
to pay you back for... for what?

18:21.084 --> 18:23.167
I got you noticed.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.136
I'm the one who took your stuff to David

18:25.138 --> 18:26.437
in the first place.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.906
Oh, so now I owe you for
the rest of my career?

18:28.908 --> 18:29.840
Yes!

18:29.842 --> 18:30.575
Jeri...

18:30.577 --> 18:32.910
I'm a good friend.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.045
I'm loyal.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.813
And I got you this job.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.348
Yeah, and I got myself this promotion.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.751
And all you had to do was
throw me under the bus.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.986
Hey, hey,

18:41.988 --> 18:42.787
I don't work like that, and you know it.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.589
Hi...

18:46.092 --> 18:47.425
Honey, I brought you a coffee.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.659
Thank you.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.696
Olivia... long time no see.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.865
Aren't you sweet? Bringing coffee.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.667
What a good girlfriend you are.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.721
I'm not a pathological narcissist...

19:00.723 --> 19:03.074
so I enjoy doing things for people.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.860
Bye, Jack.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.130
Bye, Jeri.

19:26.447 --> 19:27.997
Hi. I think I'm going to...

19:27.999 --> 19:30.516
pass on the baseball.

19:30.518 --> 19:32.101
Oh, Paul...

19:32.103 --> 19:33.235
Olivia...

19:34.065 --> 19:35.815
When I went through my divorce,

19:35.816 --> 19:37.533
I did exactly what you're doing.

19:37.535 --> 19:38.934
I threw myself into my work

19:38.936 --> 19:40.702
and avoided my life.

19:40.704 --> 19:42.871
And it doesn't work in the long run.

19:42.873 --> 19:46.508
Even before the divorce...

19:46.510 --> 19:47.726
I hated dating.

19:48.546 --> 19:50.229
Especially first dates.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.647
It's like a job interview...

19:51.649 --> 19:53.449
with an awkward kiss at the end.

19:53.451 --> 19:55.667
I think I got married just
so I could stop dating.

19:55.669 --> 19:58.353
It's a ride to a baseball game,

19:58.355 --> 20:01.223
with a hamburger on the side.

20:01.225 --> 20:02.608
If anything gets weird or uncomfortable,

20:02.610 --> 20:04.226
just text me,

20:04.228 --> 20:06.061
and I'll call you with a court emergency.

20:06.063 --> 20:06.962
You'd do that?

20:06.964 --> 20:09.031
No, it's unprofessional.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.200
But it's not going to
come to that, I promise.

20:11.202 --> 20:13.669
You're smart and funny and...

20:13.671 --> 20:15.103
So... I'm funny?

20:15.973 --> 20:16.722
Hey!

20:16.724 --> 20:17.973
What's so funny?

20:17.975 --> 20:20.325
Uh, apparently, I am.

20:20.327 --> 20:21.660
Thanks for the pep talk, coach.

20:21.662 --> 20:22.678
You're welcome.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.996
Jack...

20:23.998 --> 20:25.380
I haven't seen you

20:25.382 --> 20:27.049
since you knee-capped
me at the softball game.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.884
Yeah, yeah. You ready for a re-match?

20:28.886 --> 20:30.018
Next year?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.053
Or sooner.

20:31.055 --> 20:31.937
Let's do it sooner.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.021
Let's.

20:34.658 --> 20:36.492
Men...

20:36.494 --> 20:37.876
Why is everything a competition?

20:37.878 --> 20:39.228
'Cause it is.

20:40.130 --> 20:40.963
How was Seattle?

20:40.965 --> 20:42.464
Hmm...

20:42.466 --> 20:44.716
David says that Jeri is fired

20:44.718 --> 20:46.768
whether I take the position or not.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.737
Jeri says that she has the job

20:48.739 --> 20:50.038
until David replaces her,

20:50.040 --> 20:52.157
which means that if I take the job,

20:52.159 --> 20:55.127
I'm basically hammering the
final nail in her coffin.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.180
I feel sorry for her.

20:58.182 --> 20:59.314
Because you're a good man.

21:02.286 --> 21:03.685
All she has is that job.

21:03.687 --> 21:06.922
That's not your fault... or your problem.

21:06.924 --> 21:10.392
Unwavering support and loyalty,

21:10.394 --> 21:13.979
even in the face of someone
as undeserving as Jeri...

21:13.981 --> 21:16.064
it's one of your greatest assets.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.934
Does that mean you'll support
whatever decision I come to?

21:18.936 --> 21:20.335
Of course I will.

21:26.844 --> 21:27.910
He played me.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.561
Who, Buck?

21:29.563 --> 21:30.812
Mm.

21:30.814 --> 21:32.447
You know, in order for me to develop

21:32.449 --> 21:33.982
that beautiful piece of land, Moon,

21:33.984 --> 21:35.217
I've got to find some way

21:35.219 --> 21:36.835
to get him to sell me his half,

21:36.837 --> 21:38.887
but we both know he's not
going to do that, right?

21:40.774 --> 21:42.057
What I can't get over is
how I never saw it coming.

21:42.059 --> 21:43.942
I mean, I started to trust him.

21:43.944 --> 21:46.111
Obviously, that was my first mistake.

21:46.113 --> 21:47.613
Uh-huh.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.498
No more.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.617
Nope, my radar is on high alert.

21:51.619 --> 21:52.751
I'm... no more fishing.

21:52.753 --> 21:55.020
No more father-son
chit-chats.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.275
Maybe you should just move away.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.327
What? No. Look, I'm not going anywhere.

22:02.329 --> 22:03.445
I was here first.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.546
My father,

22:04.548 --> 22:05.847
he's the one who needs to move away.

22:05.849 --> 22:08.216
All I'm saying is,
instead of pushing him out,

22:08.218 --> 22:09.635
maybe you should focus your efforts

22:09.637 --> 22:12.888
on pulling him in a new direction.

22:12.890 --> 22:14.523
That's not going to work.

22:14.525 --> 22:17.359
Moon, Buck is the kind of
guy that you need to push.

22:19.413 --> 22:21.463
Thanks anyway.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.334
You know, I know you don't like me.

22:25.336 --> 22:27.686
True.

22:27.688 --> 22:29.321
What I don't know is,

22:29.323 --> 22:30.739
why you're giving me such helpful advice?

22:30.741 --> 22:32.140
Well...

22:32.142 --> 22:34.376
Buck has been skimping on his tips.

22:36.714 --> 22:38.013
Right.

22:38.015 --> 22:39.348
Point taken.

22:48.008 --> 22:49.291
Okay, try now.

22:52.212 --> 22:53.562
What's all this?

22:53.564 --> 22:54.896
Oh, Luke's just helping Uncle Will

22:54.898 --> 22:56.365
with your list of home repairs.

22:56.367 --> 22:59.985
You got Luke to do everything on your list?

22:59.987 --> 23:01.420
Yeah.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.871
Luke knows his way around a tool kit.

23:02.873 --> 23:04.706
Hey, have you ever heard of such a thing

23:04.708 --> 23:05.974
as a Wallet Ninja?

23:05.976 --> 23:08.343
Will... I asked you to do those things.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.811
Why does it matter who did it?

23:09.813 --> 23:10.812
You wanted it done, it's done.

23:10.814 --> 23:11.980
I see it as a win-win.

23:11.982 --> 23:12.998
That's not the point.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.316
Then what is the point?

23:14.318 --> 23:16.885
You can't pawn off everything in your life

23:16.887 --> 23:17.836
onto other people.

23:17.838 --> 23:19.421
I'm a delegator.

23:19.423 --> 23:22.283
My strongest skill is knowing other
people's strengths and weaknesses.

23:23.466 --> 23:25.646
- You two want to stay for dinner?
- Yeah.

23:25.922 --> 23:26.916
Uh, great.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.831
What is for dinner?

23:34.104 --> 23:35.750
You don't mind if we stay?

23:36.682 --> 23:39.808
I just like that my mom and Uncle Will
are getting along so well.

23:39.810 --> 23:41.109
I'm...

23:41.111 --> 23:43.245
not sure that I'd call it getting along.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.346
Is something wrong?

23:44.348 --> 23:45.881
No, it's all good.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.316
Luke...

23:48.318 --> 23:49.885
I just thought maybe we
could spend the night alone.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.103
Because?

23:51.105 --> 23:52.521
Just because.

23:52.523 --> 23:54.072
But we can stay.

23:54.074 --> 23:55.884
I know you want to be here
with your mom and uncle.

23:56.744 --> 23:58.377
Thanks. I do.

24:12.793 --> 24:15.043
Am I interrupting?

24:15.045 --> 24:16.945
No.

24:16.947 --> 24:20.015
I was just trying to take a power nap.

24:20.017 --> 24:21.516
But it's not working.

24:21.518 --> 24:23.452
You might want to try closing your eyes.

24:23.454 --> 24:25.787
It's an open-eye sleeping technique.

24:25.789 --> 24:28.290
It's stupid.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.926
Anyway... can I help you?

24:30.928 --> 24:32.728
You know, when I was in law school,

24:32.730 --> 24:34.730
I used to dunk my head
in a bucket of ice water

24:34.732 --> 24:35.981
to stay awake.

24:35.983 --> 24:38.834
It was painful, but it worked every time.

24:40.037 --> 24:41.837
I don't think so.

24:41.839 --> 24:44.055
I just don't want to see
you burn yourself out.

24:44.057 --> 24:46.892
If I say I'm fine, I'm fine.

24:46.894 --> 24:48.410
I still don't have the recommendations

24:48.412 --> 24:49.878
for the Halicky case.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.663
I am happy to do them
for you if it'll help.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.383
I'll have them on your desk in an hour.

24:55.385 --> 24:56.835
Glad to hear it.

25:04.828 --> 25:07.362
Oh, come on!

25:07.364 --> 25:08.447
Don't do this.

25:08.449 --> 25:10.449
Don't you dare do this.

25:10.451 --> 25:11.767
Please do not do this.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.102
No!

25:14.104 --> 25:15.687
Ooh, I hate the Internet.

25:15.689 --> 25:17.806
It doesn't hate you.

25:19.026 --> 25:21.243
Mom? Seriously. You look a little tense.

25:21.245 --> 25:22.627
Yeah! I'm a lot tense.

25:22.629 --> 25:24.514
The Second Hand Swap is
right around the corner

25:24.514 --> 25:26.087
and I have nowhere for people to swap,

25:26.087 --> 25:29.267
and now the Internet is down!

25:29.269 --> 25:30.268
Oh!

25:30.270 --> 25:31.236
You're a genius.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.270
Hardly.

25:32.272 --> 25:33.488
Now, what else can I do?

25:33.490 --> 25:34.923
Well...

25:34.925 --> 25:36.374
you don't happen to know of a large area

25:36.376 --> 25:38.009
suitable for a Second Hand Swap, do you?

25:38.011 --> 25:39.511
No.

25:39.513 --> 25:41.129
But I can help look.

25:41.131 --> 25:42.063
Yeah?

25:42.065 --> 25:43.515
Yeah, I love the Swap.

25:43.517 --> 25:45.150
I went to a few in New
York, but believe it or not,

25:45.152 --> 25:48.069
they could not hold a candle
to the Cedar Cove swap.

25:48.071 --> 25:49.204
Oh, what about the library?

25:49.206 --> 25:50.205
Oh, it's booked.

25:50.207 --> 25:51.456
The courthouse parking lot?

25:51.458 --> 25:53.291
Nah, they're re-paving the parking lot.

25:53.293 --> 25:54.910
Switch to a weekend?

25:54.912 --> 25:56.678
No, re-paving goes through the weekend,

25:56.680 --> 25:58.847
and more places are unavailable
on a weekend than a weekday.

25:58.849 --> 26:02.317
Okay, we need a place, and we need it now,

26:02.319 --> 26:04.953
so let's make a list and start calling.

26:04.955 --> 26:06.171
Maybe we'll get lucky.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.139
Honey, that is a great idea.

26:08.141 --> 26:09.424
We are going to call

26:09.426 --> 26:11.827
every place with a parking
lot in Cedar Cove.

26:11.829 --> 26:13.980
So there's Branigan Water,

26:14.436 --> 26:17.032
Cralle Brother Contracting, 
Elinio's Pizza Paradise...

26:17.034 --> 26:18.583
Why aren't you writing this down?

26:18.585 --> 26:20.752
Oh, me? Sure.

26:23.757 --> 26:24.840
Do you want a coffee?

26:24.842 --> 26:26.007
I'm good.

26:26.009 --> 26:28.994
Yeah, a cup of tea would be nice.

26:28.996 --> 26:30.245
Would you like me to get that?

26:30.247 --> 26:32.280
Sure, but after you do the list.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.617
Okay, now, where was I?

26:37.037 --> 26:39.187
Jeri, I wanted you to hear this from me.

26:39.189 --> 26:41.690
I am going to take David up on his offer.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.610
And I hope that you believe me

26:45.612 --> 26:47.095
when I tell you that I had nothing to do

26:47.097 --> 26:49.714
with David letting you go.

26:49.716 --> 26:52.350
I would never go behind your back.

26:52.352 --> 26:54.936
But I just simply can't fight your fight.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.407
And it would mean a lot to me

26:59.409 --> 27:01.743
if I could have your blessing

27:01.745 --> 27:03.678
and a little help

27:03.680 --> 27:05.263
as we go through this transition.

27:07.267 --> 27:10.685
There's one thing I know for sure.

27:10.687 --> 27:13.905
You will never get my blessing
for stealing my job.

27:27.662 --> 27:28.639
I've got to tell you, Dad,

27:28.682 --> 27:30.596
I would literally pay
to see you leave town.

27:30.663 --> 27:32.663
What, with my credit cards?

27:32.665 --> 27:34.748
Kid, this is the new normal.

27:34.750 --> 27:35.816
Get used to it.

27:35.818 --> 27:37.184
Or what?

27:37.186 --> 27:39.353
Nothing stopping you from leaving town.

27:39.355 --> 27:40.049
Look, let me ask you this.

27:40.207 --> 27:41.706
Why must you live in Cedar Cove?

27:41.779 --> 27:42.934
Why? Tell me that.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.608
I mean, look, it's like a
bunch of small potatoes here.

27:44.610 --> 27:45.586
You know how,

27:45.586 --> 27:47.900
if you eat in a restaurant all the time,

27:48.268 --> 27:50.197
at certain point you crave
a home-cooked meal?

27:50.199 --> 27:51.582
Oh, yeah.

27:51.584 --> 27:53.133
Well, for me,

27:53.135 --> 27:56.220
Cedar Cove is like a home-cooked meal.

27:57.306 --> 27:59.973
I've been eating out my entire life.

27:59.975 --> 28:02.709
Like it or not, I don't care, son...

28:02.711 --> 28:04.461
I'm home.

28:07.333 --> 28:10.217
You've shown amazing restraint.

28:10.219 --> 28:12.519
Not talking about the Baker case?

28:12.521 --> 28:14.438
Not teasing me about my date.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.656
Oh...

28:15.658 --> 28:16.657
you're calling it a date now?

28:16.659 --> 28:18.075
No, you are.

28:18.077 --> 28:19.359
You just did.

28:19.361 --> 28:21.094
Well, it is a date when you meet someone...

28:21.096 --> 28:22.412
So? It's a date.

28:22.414 --> 28:23.330
It's...

28:23.332 --> 28:24.531
Hey, Jack.

28:24.533 --> 28:26.266
Um, can I buy you guys a coffee?

28:26.268 --> 28:28.101
No, I'm good, thanks.

28:28.103 --> 28:29.469
Who's got a date?

28:29.471 --> 28:30.804
Paul.

28:30.806 --> 28:31.905
With Alex.

28:31.907 --> 28:33.156
Oh, nice.

28:33.158 --> 28:34.992
We're going to a baseball game together.

28:34.994 --> 28:35.909
A date.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.328
I should get going.

28:40.082 --> 28:42.382
- Well, that'll make Alex happy.
- Yeah?

28:42.384 --> 28:44.851
- She likes him.
- Oh.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.086
What are you doing here?

28:46.088 --> 28:47.704
The Court Clerk told me

28:47.706 --> 28:49.956
I might find you walking along the seawall.

28:49.956 --> 28:51.987
I wanted to ask you out myself.

28:52.487 --> 28:53.608
Sweet.

28:53.712 --> 28:57.069
I thought I'd have a better chance
if we didn't actually plan something

28:57.069 --> 28:58.131
and we just did it.

28:58.290 --> 29:00.234
So, how about dinner?

29:00.235 --> 29:04.705
We haven't had a lot of
luck in that area, have we?

29:04.707 --> 29:07.040
Want to change our luck?

29:07.042 --> 29:08.041
Yes, I do!

29:08.043 --> 29:10.010
Can I meet you there?

29:10.012 --> 29:11.244
7:00?

29:11.246 --> 29:12.312
Perfect.

29:12.314 --> 29:13.981
I'll see you there.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.026
Don't judge me.

29:26.028 --> 29:27.444
I only have 10 minutes

29:27.446 --> 29:28.629
before I need to be back at work,

29:28.631 --> 29:29.796
and I missed lunch,

29:29.798 --> 29:31.114
and I have to eat now

29:31.116 --> 29:32.833
because I'm going to miss dinner too.

29:32.835 --> 29:34.551
You still look tired.

29:34.553 --> 29:35.969
Did you try the open-eye sleep trick?

29:35.971 --> 29:37.504
I did.

29:37.506 --> 29:38.422
And I looked like an
idiot in front of Paul,

29:38.424 --> 29:39.473
so thank you for that.

29:39.475 --> 29:41.391
Your boss is so handsome.

29:41.393 --> 29:42.659
Gross. I'm eating.

29:42.661 --> 29:44.995
I'm just saying. Those eyes...

29:44.997 --> 29:46.079
I mean, hello.

29:46.081 --> 29:47.831
He's my boss.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.299
My much older boss.

29:49.301 --> 29:51.718
May to December romances are coming back.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.637
Hmm... according to the research scientists

29:53.639 --> 29:55.989
at which fashion magazine?

29:55.991 --> 29:57.774
The only thing I care about is my career.

29:57.776 --> 29:59.660
Within three years,

29:59.662 --> 30:02.329
I, not Paul, will be Cedar Cove's lead D.A.

30:02.331 --> 30:03.714
Within five years,

30:03.716 --> 30:05.799
I will be the lead D.A.
for a major urban center,

30:05.801 --> 30:07.167
preferably on the east coast,

30:07.169 --> 30:08.602
but I'm flexible.

30:08.604 --> 30:10.771
Watch out, baby blue eyes,

30:10.773 --> 30:12.356
I'm gunning for your job.

30:12.358 --> 30:15.158
What about getting
married and having babies?

30:15.160 --> 30:16.309
What about it?

30:16.311 --> 30:19.429
- What's your timeline for that?
- Timeline?

30:19.431 --> 30:21.348
I plan to be married within three years,

30:21.350 --> 30:24.985
and I want to have my
first child before I'm 30.

30:24.987 --> 30:27.320
I'm really hoping it's a girl.

30:27.322 --> 30:28.655
Or twin boys...

30:28.657 --> 30:29.756
Leo and Max.

30:29.758 --> 30:31.625
Okay...

30:31.627 --> 30:34.127
I'm going to go back to the real world now.

30:35.514 --> 30:37.264
I'm going to be home late,

30:37.266 --> 30:39.599
so don't get all worried.

30:54.450 --> 30:55.315
You look happy.

30:55.317 --> 30:57.284
I am happy.

30:57.286 --> 30:59.202
I have a date with Jack.

30:59.204 --> 31:00.954
Well, you guys seem better.

31:00.956 --> 31:03.090
We are better.

31:03.092 --> 31:04.474
We need to be better.

31:04.476 --> 31:05.926
Yeah?

31:05.928 --> 31:07.394
When I asked you to help around the house,

31:07.396 --> 31:09.396
I didn't mean for you to get Luke to do it.

31:09.398 --> 31:11.364
Everything got done.

31:11.366 --> 31:13.200
But not by you.

31:13.202 --> 31:14.101
Why does that matter?

31:14.103 --> 31:15.218
Accountability, Will.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.420
Huh?

31:16.422 --> 31:18.305
I'm not your ex-wife, or your mother.

31:18.307 --> 31:19.840
I am not going to take care of you.

31:19.842 --> 31:21.742
- Who asked you to?
- You did.

31:21.744 --> 31:22.993
I didn't.

31:22.995 --> 31:24.745
You have a way of asking without asking,

31:24.747 --> 31:25.996
but it is still asking.

31:25.998 --> 31:26.947
I didn't.

31:26.949 --> 31:28.582
You moved in here.

31:28.584 --> 31:30.167
Because I want us to get along.

31:30.169 --> 31:32.686
Because you didn't have a place to stay.

31:32.688 --> 31:33.970
And your idea of getting along

31:33.972 --> 31:35.689
is me doing everything.

31:35.691 --> 31:38.191
That's on you. Not me.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.796
You like it that way.

31:43.899 --> 31:45.882
You know I'm right.

31:50.439 --> 31:52.072
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

31:52.074 --> 31:54.741
Oh, I love baseball.

31:54.743 --> 31:57.477
Me too.

31:57.479 --> 31:59.546
You know, ever since
that dinner at Olivia's,

31:59.548 --> 32:01.932
I was hoping that we'd
run into each other...

32:01.934 --> 32:03.016
and do something.

32:03.018 --> 32:04.401
You were?

32:04.403 --> 32:05.986
I was.

32:07.039 --> 32:08.371
Well, here we are.

32:08.373 --> 32:09.372
We are here.

32:09.374 --> 32:10.240
Eating pizza.

32:10.242 --> 32:12.125
Because I asked you out.

32:13.929 --> 32:16.379
I did! I just want to be clear.

32:16.381 --> 32:17.464
Mm-hmm.

32:17.466 --> 32:18.999
- It's too aggressive, huh?
- No!

32:19.001 --> 32:22.903
No, I mean, you're not
shy, I'll give you that.

32:22.905 --> 32:24.354
It's Wall Street

32:24.356 --> 32:26.773
and being raised with six brothers.

32:26.775 --> 32:28.291
Six?

32:28.293 --> 32:30.327
Yeah. You?

32:30.329 --> 32:32.345
Six. Brothers and sisters?

32:32.347 --> 32:33.180
Where do you fall?

32:33.182 --> 32:34.047
Eldest. You?

32:34.049 --> 32:35.131
Same.

32:36.718 --> 32:38.718
This is the first thing we have in common.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.687
Well, this, and baseball and pizza.

32:40.689 --> 32:42.105
True, true.

32:44.977 --> 32:46.226
Okay...

32:46.228 --> 32:48.528
How on earth did you get Moon

32:48.530 --> 32:49.696
to give us his courtyard

32:49.698 --> 32:52.365
on one of his busiest days of the week?

32:52.367 --> 32:53.950
I did my puppy-dog sad face.

32:53.952 --> 32:55.252
I taught you that face.

32:55.254 --> 32:57.037
You did.

32:59.691 --> 33:01.641
Poor Moon... didn't stand a chance.

33:01.643 --> 33:02.976
Aw, honey.

33:02.978 --> 33:05.612
Thank you so much for helping me with this.

33:05.614 --> 33:07.647
I loved it.

33:07.649 --> 33:09.399
It's why I love living here

33:09.401 --> 33:10.700
and living so close to you.

33:10.702 --> 33:12.452
Aw. But you love John.

33:12.454 --> 33:14.754
Trying to work things out.

33:14.756 --> 33:15.705
I miss him so much.

33:15.707 --> 33:17.724
Oh, honey...

33:17.726 --> 33:19.593
Well, I'm here if you need me...

33:19.595 --> 33:21.478
to listen, talk...

33:21.480 --> 33:22.479
eat ice cream.

33:22.481 --> 33:24.731
Aw, thanks, Mom.

33:33.242 --> 33:34.107
So...

33:34.109 --> 33:36.459
we finally got here.

33:36.461 --> 33:37.377
Finally?

33:37.379 --> 33:38.712
Yes!

33:38.714 --> 33:40.714
I have been trying to take you out

33:40.716 --> 33:42.265
for a nice romantic dinner

33:42.267 --> 33:43.516
for what seems like forever.

33:43.518 --> 33:45.819
Are we celebrating something?

33:45.821 --> 33:48.188
I am going to take the job.

33:48.190 --> 33:50.323
Congratulations.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.459
Go on.

33:52.461 --> 33:54.995
Um...

33:54.997 --> 33:56.830
what's your first article going to be?

33:56.832 --> 33:58.098
Not article...

33:58.100 --> 33:59.132
Editorial.

33:59.134 --> 34:02.385
Nobody owns water.

34:02.387 --> 34:04.104
It legally belongs to everybody.

34:04.106 --> 34:05.772
I can't wait to read it.

34:05.774 --> 34:08.108
I can't wait to write it.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.359
You know, the only thing

34:09.360 --> 34:11.610
that makes this moment in my life better

34:11.612 --> 34:13.413
is that we're sharing it together.

34:15.516 --> 34:17.183
That's so sweet.

34:19.638 --> 34:20.754
I, um...

34:22.391 --> 34:24.474
saw this,

34:24.476 --> 34:27.027
and I thought of you.

34:27.029 --> 34:28.728
I wanted to mark the day.

34:30.482 --> 34:31.614
Oh...

34:37.121 --> 34:40.005
Jack... it's beautiful.

34:40.007 --> 34:42.007
So are you.

34:44.228 --> 34:46.679
Hey.

34:46.681 --> 34:48.514
I want to make sure that you're okay

34:48.516 --> 34:51.818
with my decision about taking this job.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.536
Actually, more than okay.

34:53.538 --> 34:57.574
We're a team, me and you, right?

34:57.576 --> 34:58.992
I want to know

34:58.994 --> 35:00.627
that you're good about me taking this job.

35:01.964 --> 35:04.030
Jack Griffith...

35:04.032 --> 35:07.017
I support you 100%.

35:07.019 --> 35:08.985
I am very lucky.

35:08.987 --> 35:10.520
So am I.

35:19.464 --> 35:21.081
That was fantastic.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.415
I can't believe the game ended that way.

35:22.417 --> 35:25.085
Three people on base,
two outs, three fouls...

35:25.087 --> 35:26.219
and that pitch...

35:26.221 --> 35:27.253
Oh, homer, right over the fence.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.888
Beautiful grand slam.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.106
Beautiful.

35:30.942 --> 35:32.242
Thank you for the ticket.

35:32.244 --> 35:33.360
You're welcome.

35:33.362 --> 35:34.277
And thank you for the dinner too.

35:34.279 --> 35:35.362
It was fun.

35:35.364 --> 35:36.896
It was.

35:36.898 --> 35:38.331
Next time, though,

35:38.333 --> 35:40.166
remind me that heels
and stadiums don't mix.

35:41.336 --> 35:42.969
Next time?

35:45.757 --> 35:46.923
Are you sure you don't want a ride home?

35:46.925 --> 35:48.341
Yeah.

35:48.343 --> 35:49.392
Yeah, I love to walk.

35:49.394 --> 35:50.777
New Yorkers always do, huh?

35:50.779 --> 35:52.112
True.

35:55.734 --> 35:56.866
Thank you...

35:57.703 --> 35:59.452
for the ticket.

36:00.756 --> 36:02.672
You're welcome.

36:03.425 --> 36:05.091
Bye.

36:13.295 --> 36:14.344
This is nice.

36:14.939 --> 36:15.984
Yeah, it is.

36:18.354 --> 36:19.436
Can I ask you something?

36:19.438 --> 36:21.271
Sure.

36:21.273 --> 36:22.689
Where do you see yourself going?

36:22.691 --> 36:23.824
Going?

36:23.826 --> 36:26.410
Yeah, like, 10 years from now?

36:26.412 --> 36:28.195
Oh. You mean my future?

36:28.197 --> 36:29.830
Yeah.

36:29.832 --> 36:31.832
Um...

36:31.834 --> 36:33.300
10 years, huh?

36:33.302 --> 36:34.434
Give or take.

36:35.688 --> 36:37.688
I guess, uh...

36:37.690 --> 36:39.556
married.

36:39.558 --> 36:41.992
Kids... twins, I hope.

36:41.994 --> 36:43.910
Jordan and I were twins, so...

36:43.912 --> 36:46.179
Mm...

36:46.181 --> 36:49.499
A dog... Buddy.

36:49.501 --> 36:50.617
A lab.

36:50.619 --> 36:53.253
A house for the kids and Buddy...

36:53.255 --> 36:54.638
Wow...

36:54.640 --> 36:56.256
Too much?

36:56.258 --> 36:57.674
No.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.326
It's just you have it all planned out.

36:59.328 --> 37:00.861
I've been thinking about
some of these things

37:00.863 --> 37:01.862
since I was a little girl.

37:01.864 --> 37:02.979
Things you want?

37:04.233 --> 37:05.732
Yeah.

37:05.734 --> 37:09.336
Family, home, dog...

37:09.338 --> 37:12.339
So, what does your future look like?

37:13.625 --> 37:14.708
I don't know.

37:17.513 --> 37:20.347
But it doesn't involve kids.

37:23.652 --> 37:25.485
Maybe you'll change your mind.

37:25.487 --> 37:27.487
Maybe I'll be the girl to change it.

37:30.325 --> 37:33.794
You are the most amazing
girl I have ever dated.

37:33.796 --> 37:35.128
But even you won't be able

37:35.130 --> 37:36.546
to change my mind about having kids.

37:36.548 --> 37:39.516
It's not something I ever want to do.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.796
So...?

37:52.798 --> 37:54.247
Impressive.

37:54.249 --> 37:55.248
Yeah?

37:55.250 --> 37:58.085
I love seeing you this excited.

37:59.421 --> 38:02.506
Well, it's a new world for me, management.

38:02.508 --> 38:03.974
You're going to be great.

38:05.561 --> 38:06.726
I have had

38:06.728 --> 38:08.428
so many terrible editors in my life,

38:08.430 --> 38:11.181
I swore that if I ever
got a chance to do the job,

38:11.183 --> 38:13.266
I would do it right...

38:13.268 --> 38:14.768
people would actually be excited

38:14.770 --> 38:17.154
about coming to work.

38:17.156 --> 38:18.105
Oh...

38:18.107 --> 38:19.106
Hey.

38:19.108 --> 38:20.107
Aww.

38:20.109 --> 38:21.408
Jack.

38:21.410 --> 38:23.827
Oh, hey, boss.

38:23.829 --> 38:24.744
Uh, this is...

38:24.746 --> 38:25.745
David?

38:25.747 --> 38:27.414
Already talking about me?

38:27.416 --> 38:28.415
That's either good or bad.

38:28.417 --> 38:30.550
No, it's all good.

38:30.552 --> 38:32.669
Well, you know my name,
but I don't know yours.

38:32.671 --> 38:33.670
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:33.672 --> 38:35.505
This is Olivia Lockhart.

38:35.507 --> 38:36.139
Nice to meet you.

38:36.141 --> 38:37.090
Pleasure.

38:37.092 --> 38:38.558
I was just showing her the office.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.759
Well, let me know if you need any help

38:39.761 --> 38:41.094
with finding a place to live.

38:41.096 --> 38:43.146
Oh, I'm staying in Cedar Cove.

38:43.148 --> 38:45.182
Well, the job is more than full-time...

38:45.184 --> 38:47.684
And the job is here...

38:47.686 --> 38:49.736
in Seattle.

39:01.700 --> 39:02.949
Hello?

39:02.951 --> 39:05.702
No, I haven't. Have you tried the house?

39:08.757 --> 39:11.675
Yeah, I'll call you as soon as I see her.

39:11.677 --> 39:12.959
Bye.

39:15.631 --> 39:17.597
Another skinny latte?

39:19.301 --> 39:20.717
Something wrong?

39:21.970 --> 39:23.687
That was Rebecca's boss.

39:23.689 --> 39:26.273
She didn't show up for work this morning.

39:26.275 --> 39:28.141
Haven't seen her.

39:35.784 --> 39:38.201
You are being so short-sighted here, Alex.

39:38.203 --> 39:40.570
I mean, here I am, offering
you a 10% bump in salary,

39:40.572 --> 39:42.489
not to mention six percent
equity in the company,

39:42.491 --> 39:43.740
and you're doing...

39:43.742 --> 39:44.791
you've been here, what, two seconds?

39:44.793 --> 39:45.992
Alex, look at me.

39:45.994 --> 39:47.427
This is an outrageous offer.

39:47.429 --> 39:48.662
If I was you, I would jump on it.

39:49.498 --> 39:50.714
Buck hired me.

39:50.716 --> 39:51.798
I'm not going to just overthrow him,

39:51.800 --> 39:53.216
or whatever you called it,

39:53.218 --> 39:55.335
just so you can prove
a point to your father.

39:55.337 --> 39:57.837
Let the Charlotte house go.

39:57.839 --> 39:58.889
Move on...

39:58.891 --> 40:02.175
for you, not for him.

40:02.177 --> 40:04.761
You think Buck would have
done the same for you?

40:04.763 --> 40:06.179
Let's be serious here.

40:06.181 --> 40:07.230
I'm his son. You saw what happened.

40:07.232 --> 40:08.682
Kicks me out of my own company,

40:08.684 --> 40:09.649
purchases my share in Charlotte's house

40:09.651 --> 40:10.901
behind my back.

40:10.903 --> 40:11.851
Now, what father does that to his son?

40:11.853 --> 40:12.903
He's a snake, Alex.

40:12.905 --> 40:14.437
Says the son of the snake,

40:14.439 --> 40:16.356
which, by the way, also makes you a snake.

40:16.358 --> 40:18.858
You know, you can't even talk...

40:18.860 --> 40:20.277
Listen, if I was you,

40:20.279 --> 40:21.861
I would seriously think about this offer.

40:23.332 --> 40:24.698
Look,

40:24.700 --> 40:25.865
as soon as Buck is done
messing with my life,

40:25.867 --> 40:27.701
and he gets bored and moves on...

40:27.703 --> 40:29.536
And trust me, he will...

40:29.538 --> 40:31.454
You're history.

40:34.593 --> 40:36.009
I checked her room.

40:36.011 --> 40:38.094
It doesn't look like she slept here.

40:38.096 --> 40:39.262
Rebecca is smart and capable.

40:39.264 --> 40:41.381
I'm sure she just fell asleep somewhere.

40:41.383 --> 40:42.716
We should call the sheriff.

40:42.718 --> 40:44.768
I think we have to wait 24 hours.

40:48.390 --> 40:50.223
She's okay, right?

40:50.225 --> 40:51.641
I'm sure she is,

40:51.643 --> 40:52.726
and we'll yell at her when we find her,

40:52.728 --> 40:54.561
but first, we need to find her so we can...

40:54.563 --> 40:55.862
Yell at her.

40:55.864 --> 40:57.063
Yeah.

41:01.486 --> 41:03.699
- Mr. Watson.
- Judge Lockhart.

41:03.789 --> 41:06.239
Will I have the pleasure of your
company in my courtroom today?

41:06.241 --> 41:07.707
More than you know.

41:07.709 --> 41:08.658
More?

41:08.660 --> 41:09.743
Rebecca's a no-show.

41:09.745 --> 41:11.797
- She didn't come to work?
- Nope, she did not.

41:11.964 --> 41:13.142
- Did you call her?
- At her house?

41:13.290 --> 41:15.326
- Yeah, her roommates haven't seen her.
- That's not good.

41:15.482 --> 41:16.929
What, that my highly stressed out,

41:17.075 --> 41:18.321
type-A workaholic A.D.A.,

41:18.466 --> 41:19.727
who is always on time,

41:19.727 --> 41:21.508
isn't here, and is not answering her cell?

41:21.681 --> 41:23.399
No... it's not good.
