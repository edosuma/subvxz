00:15.791 --> 00:17.166
You can't trust her.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.833
Why not?

00:18.833 --> 00:22.250
You were working with Manticore
just days before Citadel fell.

00:25.666 --> 00:29.833
With you I'm me,
and only with you am I me.

00:29.833 --> 00:31.125
Marry me.

00:32.958 --> 00:35.291
<i>You're gonna answer
one question.</i>

00:35.291 --> 00:36.541
Did he know?

00:36.541 --> 00:38.416
<i>I did it for you,</i>

00:38.416 --> 00:39.500
to protect you.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.958
Goodbye, Mason.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.750
<i>Something's happened.</i>

00:46.750 --> 00:48.041
I need to get out.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.000
When you turn
your back on Citadel,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.875
what are you going to do
about Kane?

00:51.875 --> 00:53.208
Mason can never find out.

00:53.208 --> 00:54.750
<i>You killed
all of those agents.</i>

00:54.750 --> 00:58.166
Murderers, war criminals, spies,

00:58.166 --> 01:00.375
but I can't take all the credit.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.958
<i>It was one of your own
who came to me.</i>

01:02.958 --> 01:07.041
A Citadel spy
saw the truth of the agency

01:07.041 --> 01:08.666
and betrayed you all.

01:08.666 --> 01:10.875
What was in Valencia?

01:10.875 --> 01:12.291
I have a daughter.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.041
And I had to keep her secret

01:14.041 --> 01:16.125
because that was the only way
to keep her safe.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.416
- Is she...?
- Yes.

01:18.416 --> 01:19.708
<i>Kyle Conroy.</i>

01:20.750 --> 01:21.916
<i>I've been anxious
to speak with you</i>

01:21.916 --> 01:23.916
for a very long time.

01:23.916 --> 01:26.833
<i>There's a submarine
somewhere in the Pacific.</i>

01:26.833 --> 01:28.625
<i>It has something I seek</i>

01:28.625 --> 01:31.125
<i>and you're going to help me
retrieve them.</i>

01:31.125 --> 01:32.416
Why would I do that?

01:32.416 --> 01:34.583
<i>Because I have
your daughter.</i>

02:51.625 --> 02:53.000
Well, come on.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.958
Up you get.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.625
If you're living
in your grandmother's home,

03:00.625 --> 03:03.291
you're not staying in bed
past noon.

03:05.833 --> 03:08.333
Your father used to sleep
till 2:00.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.375
He was nocturnal, your dad.

03:13.916 --> 03:16.041
I miss him.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.333
I miss him, too.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.083
Every day, I miss him.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.166
Is my mom coming back soon?

03:26.166 --> 03:27.833
She's, um...

03:28.875 --> 03:31.958
She's been traveling,
last I heard.

03:31.958 --> 03:35.916
Don't go focusing
on things you can't change.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.625
Only the things you can.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.833
<i>[over TV] Rebirth
is painful.</i>

03:39.833 --> 03:41.833
<i>Isn't it easier to go forward</i>

03:41.833 --> 03:43.541
<i>when you know you can't go back?</i>

03:43.541 --> 03:45.291
<i>Life again.</i>

03:45.291 --> 03:48.333
<i>Begin again, all new,
all different.</i>

03:48.333 --> 03:50.291
<i>The way you always wanted it.</i>

03:50.291 --> 03:52.083
<i>You got another chance.</i>

03:53.125 --> 03:55.875
<i>Heck, nobody's gonna miss you,
are they?</i>

04:02.541 --> 04:05.000
<i>Well, I never.</i>

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
<i>Holy mackerel,
I don't know how you boys do it.</i>

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Doc, it's a masterpiece.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.833
Good work.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.958
<i>Easy does it.</i>

04:31.125 --> 04:33.125
<i>You know how
I ended up a spy?</i>

04:33.125 --> 04:34.375
<i>I was five years old</i>

04:34.375 --> 04:36.583
and my dad died and my mom left

04:36.583 --> 04:38.458
like I didn't exist.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.791
<i>Now, Citadel gave me
an identity.</i>

04:43.791 --> 04:46.166
<i>Not existing was an asset.</i>

04:46.166 --> 04:48.208
<i>They saw me.</i>

04:51.166 --> 04:54.291
<i>I met you and I knew who I was.</i>

04:58.083 --> 04:59.833
<i>[over TV] Go on, son,
let it out.</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:01.916
<i>Nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

06:53.125 --> 06:55.166
<i>[over phone] You're
being transported</i>

06:55.166 --> 06:56.541
<i>to a hangar outside Fez</i>

06:56.541 --> 06:58.166
<i>where you'll be debriefed
of the mission</i>

06:58.166 --> 07:00.250
<i>under our watch.</i>

07:00.250 --> 07:02.000
<i>If you try anything clever,</i>

07:02.000 --> 07:04.291
<i>we'll have no choice
but to kill her.</i>

07:04.291 --> 07:06.166
We need to see the girl.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.416
<i>You're not in
a position to negotiate.</i>

07:07.416 --> 07:09.166
If you want us
to even begin to consider

07:09.166 --> 07:12.041
what you're asking,
show us the girl is safe.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.041
<i>Be assured she is.</i>

07:59.125 --> 08:00.958
<i>It's getting late,
so I'll be brief.</i>

08:00.958 --> 08:05.541
<i>Within the hour our stealth jet
will fly you over the Pacific.</i>

08:05.541 --> 08:07.375
<i>My man, Davik,
will accompany you.</i>

08:07.375 --> 08:10.416
<i>You'll hack into the submarine
and have it breach the surface.</i>

08:10.416 --> 08:13.750
<i>Kyle and Davik will make
an airborne jump,</i>

08:13.750 --> 08:16.666
<i>get inside and retrieve
the five nuclear cores</i>

08:16.666 --> 08:19.500
<i>from the Dead Hand missiles,
and bring them to Christoph</i>

08:19.500 --> 08:21.500
<i>in Valencia for the exchange.</i>

08:21.500 --> 08:23.750
She's my daughter, I'm running
this op, I make this jump.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.416
<i>That's not possible.</i>

08:25.416 --> 08:27.208
He is not equipped.

08:27.208 --> 08:30.208
<i>Agent Spence, would you like
to acquaint your colleague</i>

08:30.208 --> 08:31.958
<i>with reality?</i>

08:31.958 --> 08:35.000
It has to be Mason.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.666
It was his Red Cell mission.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.083
When was it his
Red Cell mission, Carter?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.000
When you were gone.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.916
Look, it's Mason's credentials,
he made the jump,

08:44.916 --> 08:47.708
installed his biolock...

08:47.708 --> 08:49.416
against orders.

08:49.416 --> 08:51.708
He's the only one
that can access the sub.

08:51.708 --> 08:54.166
Want to tell me
what a Red Cell mission is?

08:54.166 --> 08:55.708
Fuck.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.500
There's no way
he can do this.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.458
Operation Bright Wall
has been Red Cell authorized.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.541
Our target is Russia's
Dead Hand sub.

09:04.541 --> 09:07.125
We're hacking into
an automated nuclear submarine.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.291
To account for a scenario
where the Russians one day

09:09.291 --> 09:11.500
launch their own nuclear weapons
at a sovereign target,

09:11.500 --> 09:14.041
we're gonna install
our own backdoor security lock

09:14.041 --> 09:17.083
to allow any Citadel agent access.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.541
We have a small window
where we believe we can do this

09:18.541 --> 09:20.166
without alerting Russia's
armed forces.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.375
Mason, are you with me?

09:23.416 --> 09:25.541
- I'm with you.
- Then act like it.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.125
If you think someone would
be better for the job,

09:29.125 --> 09:30.958
I'm happy to sit this one out.

09:30.958 --> 09:33.708
Maybe you should call Nadia,
bring her back in.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.250
Really. You should call her.

09:39.250 --> 09:43.166
I don't have that option at my
disposal, but I imagine you do.

09:46.958 --> 09:51.250
Duke will maintain altitude
at 5,000 feet to avoid radar.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.250
You will have a less than
infinitesimal window

09:53.250 --> 09:54.625
to execute the jump.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.250
Once you've landed
on the sub,

09:56.250 --> 09:57.458
you want to look
for the control module.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.208
It'll be on the sail
by the antenna array.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.833
You want to place this
between the main

10:01.833 --> 10:03.583
and the backup power relays.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.541
It's already coded
to your endocrine system,

10:05.541 --> 10:07.583
so you'll be able to bypass
the sub security

10:07.583 --> 10:09.416
if you ever need
to make a return visit.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.625
<i>I do this,
I want something in return.</i>

10:12.625 --> 10:14.750
I'm sorry?

10:14.750 --> 10:16.041
You must have us confused

10:16.041 --> 10:17.583
with being in some sort
of a negotiation.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.625
- There's no op without me.
- Nadia's gone.

10:19.625 --> 10:21.541
- Deal with it.
- You know where she is.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.375
- She's in Berlin.
- She's not in Berlin.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.958
- She's in Berlin.
- Where is she, Grace?!

10:29.666 --> 10:31.833
So I get access
to the sub and then what?

10:31.833 --> 10:33.166
You'll have to
manually override

10:33.166 --> 10:35.041
control of the nuclear cores.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.916
Manually override
a nuclear device?

10:36.916 --> 10:38.958
Like Chernobyl?
You seen Chernobyl?

10:38.958 --> 10:40.500
The chamber housing
the nukes

10:40.500 --> 10:43.333
is temperature controlled
at 106 degrees Fahrenheit.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.291
If it detects a lower
temperature in the room

10:45.291 --> 10:47.750
it's going to shut you out permanently.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.791
I hope you're up for this.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.000
Me, too.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.791
Hawking has reached
optimal altitude.

11:26.791 --> 11:29.833
<i>- Mason,
are you ready?
- Ready.</i>

11:29.833 --> 11:31.708
<i>[over comms] Hacking
into the Dead Hand firewall now.</i>

11:31.708 --> 11:33.625
I'm in position
for Red Cell deployment.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.291
Winds are clocking
at over 50 knots at sea level.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.541
Let's do this.

11:36.541 --> 11:38.250
<i>T-minus five,</i>

11:38.250 --> 11:41.291
four, three,

11:41.291 --> 11:42.958
<i>two, one.</i>

11:45.791 --> 11:48.250
<i>You should see the Dead Hand sub
emerging to the surface now.</i>

11:48.250 --> 11:50.208
I see the sub.
Deploying chute.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.416
Mason's chute's initiated.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.791
Biometrics locked in.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.083
This cake is baked.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
<i>Let's get you
out of there.</i>

12:11.125 --> 12:12.791
Mason, you're offline.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.833
Mason?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.833
<i>Secondary protocol interrupt. Activated.</i>

12:22.833 --> 12:25.125
Kilo, Lima, Bravo,
Juliette, 1-2-5.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.375
<i>There was a frequency
glitch. Are you receiving?</i>

12:28.375 --> 12:29.583
<i>Yeah,
we can hear you now.</i>

12:29.583 --> 12:30.875
I'm ready for pickup.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.583
<i>All right,
bringing you home.</i>

12:43.416 --> 12:45.791
Dead Hand sub located.

12:45.791 --> 12:49.375
I'll try to hack
the firewall now.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.083
I'm just gonna fix your suit.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.416
Why didn't I deserve
to know about Asha?

13:09.166 --> 13:11.125
You don't want to do this
right now, Kyle.

13:11.125 --> 13:14.416
- Why not?
- Because you need to focus
on the jump.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.208
That's right.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.458
You better be ready.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.583
<i>All right, we just
reached optimal altitude.</i>

13:33.500 --> 13:35.791
<i>Kyle, are you ready?</i>

13:42.000 --> 13:43.041
Ready.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.666
Entering target drop zone.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.291
Initiate countdown.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.000

14:02.166 --> 14:04.750
<i>Stay in position.
You're reaching peak altitude.</i>

14:04.750 --> 14:06.666
<i>The sub will breach directly
beneath you.</i>

14:06.666 --> 14:08.166
All right, now hold position.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.833
Tell me you can see something,
'cause all I see is ocean!

14:15.833 --> 14:17.250
Working on it.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.458
Where's the submarine?

14:19.416 --> 14:20.916
You have to get it
to breach now.

14:20.916 --> 14:22.166
I'm going
as fast as I can.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.041
<i>Please tell me
there's a sub coming.</i>

14:24.041 --> 14:25.875
Carter, he's moving too fast.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.708
<i>Hang on, pal.
Sub's about to breach.</i>

14:27.708 --> 14:29.708
<i>Emergency surface initiated.</i>

14:38.625 --> 14:39.500
You're getting too low.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.708
- Deploy chute.
- Now.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.333
<i>All right, level out.</i>

14:43.333 --> 14:44.958
Pull down on the left toggle.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.625
That's all I need you for.

16:08.666 --> 16:10.125
Kyle?

16:11.708 --> 16:12.875
I'm heading down there.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stand down.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.833
You know that was
the pilot, right?

16:26.833 --> 16:28.250
Tell me she still flies herself.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.750
I got this. Go.

16:55.416 --> 16:56.833
Status report.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.458
<i>[over comms] Did you
really think</i>

16:58.458 --> 17:00.750
<i>you could kill my brother

17:00.750 --> 17:03.041
You listen closely.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.916
The five Dead Hand missiles

17:04.916 --> 17:07.875
are locked on Manticore
family compounds.

17:07.875 --> 17:10.000
Mexico City, Florence,

- What are you doing?
<i>- I want a seat at the table.</i>

17:15.333 --> 17:16.958
Give me that
and I give you your warheads.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.208
If not,

17:18.208 --> 17:20.000
<i>you're gonna watch
Manticore burn.</i>

17:21.833 --> 17:23.291
<i>Kyle, you got

17:23.291 --> 17:25.333
<i>Kyle, can you hear me?</i>

17:26.333 --> 17:28.833
<i>Kyle! Kyle!</i>

17:29.791 --> 17:31.041
<i>Kyle,</i>

17:31.041 --> 17:33.041
Davik just started
the Dead Hand launch sequence.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.666
You need to get the cores now.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.416
<i>Well, the answer,
my darling,</i>

17:38.416 --> 17:39.958
is burn.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.916
<i>Because we do not negotiate</i>

17:41.916 --> 17:46.541
with traitors and because
you are a dense, pathetic ape.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.125
<i>You understand that we've hacked</i>

17:48.125 --> 17:49.875
<i>the steering mechanism
on that ship,</i>

17:49.875 --> 17:53.083
<i>so before the ballistic warheads
could even take flight,</i>

17:53.083 --> 17:54.916
I would send that submarine

17:54.916 --> 17:58.583
plummeting inverted into the
depths of the Mariana Trench

17:58.583 --> 18:00.250
where you would be vaporized

18:00.250 --> 18:02.125
by the very weapons of mass destruction

18:02.125 --> 18:05.666
with which you have so woefully
tried to threaten me!

18:05.666 --> 18:07.750
<i>Goodbye, Davik.</i>

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Didn't go the way you wanted?

18:14.833 --> 18:17.166
I thought I already killed you.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.125
You're supposed
to actually pull the trigger.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.541
You just parachute
down here?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.541
Yeah, I'm amazing. Carter,

18:30.541 --> 18:31.583
<i>how do I cancel this launch?</i>

18:31.583 --> 18:32.666
I can't hack
the system.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.708
Dahlia initiated an override.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.375
<i>The only way to stop it
is to get the cores now.</i>

18:36.375 --> 18:38.041
<i>Make sure you grab
the temperature regulator.</i>

18:38.041 --> 18:40.208
- Here.
- Thanks.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.666
Plans still the same?

18:41.666 --> 18:43.708
Raise my body temperature
to match the launch room's?

18:43.708 --> 18:47.208
Yeah. But you've got less than
half the time to get the cores.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.083
<i>The jab will raise
your external body temperature</i>

18:49.083 --> 18:50.791
<i>so you can operate undetected.</i>

18:50.791 --> 18:53.625
<i>You got to hit 106 degrees
to match the launch room temp</i>

18:53.625 --> 18:55.583
<i>or the system will detect
your heat signature</i>

18:55.583 --> 18:57.625
<i>and lock down the warheads.</i>

18:58.416 --> 18:59.583
It's working.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.833
<i>Try to keep your breathing slow.</i>

19:02.833 --> 19:04.458
<i>101...</i>

19:04.458 --> 19:09.416
<i>102, 103, 104,</i>

19:09.416 --> 19:11.958
<i>105, 106.</i>

19:11.958 --> 19:14.041
<i>Go.</i>

19:14.041 --> 19:15.208
<i>I'm in.</i>

19:15.208 --> 19:17.000
All right,
temperature holding steady.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.625
<i>Under four minutes till launch.</i>

19:19.625 --> 19:23.208
<i>Each missile should deactivate
once you remove the cores.</i>

19:23.208 --> 19:26.375
<i>Remove all five before anything
launches and crisis averted.</i>

19:27.875 --> 19:30.250
<i>That's if you don't boil alive beforehand.</i>

19:49.583 --> 19:52.416
<i>- That's one.</i>
- Take it easy.

19:52.416 --> 19:54.500
Don't move.

19:58.250 --> 20:01.708
I imagine...

20:01.708 --> 20:04.375
that life was simpler
as Kyle Conroy.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.458
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

20:29.458 --> 20:30.833
<i>Don't worry about it. Focus.</i>

20:30.833 --> 20:32.166
That's four.
How much time?

20:32.166 --> 20:33.500
<i>Less than 90 seconds.</i>

20:33.500 --> 20:35.458
<i>Your heart is getting closer
to 350 bpm.</i>

20:35.458 --> 20:37.625
<i>You've got to finish quick
before you black out.</i>

20:49.083 --> 20:51.500
Kyle, you have to fight back!

20:57.125 --> 21:00.416
What is that?

21:00.416 --> 21:02.041
It's the final launch countdown.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.291
<i>You've got 20 seconds, Nadia.</i>

21:03.291 --> 21:04.875
<i>Kyle?</i>

21:04.875 --> 21:06.208
<i>Backstop erases your memories,</i>

21:06.208 --> 21:08.083
<i>but it doesn't
erase your skills.</i>

21:08.083 --> 21:10.250
<i>Your mind
may not remember...</i>

21:10.250 --> 21:11.666
Do you want to remember?

21:11.666 --> 21:13.416
<i>...but your body does.</i>

21:13.416 --> 21:14.875
<i>Ten seconds, Nadia.</i>

21:16.625 --> 21:18.750
<i>Deactivate the cores.</i>

21:18.750 --> 21:19.916
<i>Five seconds.</i>

21:19.916 --> 21:21.750
You want to save your family?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.916
<i>You just listen to me and
I will get you through this.</i>

21:23.916 --> 21:24.958
<i>Come on.</i>

21:24.958 --> 21:27.416
<i>Yes. Launch is disabled.</i>

21:27.416 --> 21:29.250
<i>Kyle, listen to me.</i>

21:29.250 --> 21:31.291
<i>You are still Mason Kane.</i>

21:31.291 --> 21:32.458
Get up! Now!

21:32.458 --> 21:34.416
<i>Fight back!</i>

21:50.500 --> 21:52.458
<i>Kyle, you got
to get to Nadia.</i>

21:52.458 --> 21:53.666
<i>She's coding.</i>

21:54.833 --> 21:56.000
Nadia.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.041
<i>You've got a vile of
adrenaline in your suit.</i>

22:00.041 --> 22:02.041
<i>Jab her now or her heart stops.</i>

22:02.041 --> 22:05.375
- Got it.
<i>- Inject her now or she dies.</i>

22:05.375 --> 22:07.416
Hang in there. Hang in there.

22:07.416 --> 22:10.416
<i>- Hang in there.</i>
- It's working.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.083
Heart rate's back to normal.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.416
<i>Kyle, I have Russian bombers
60 miles out, fast approaching.</i>

22:19.416 --> 22:21.750
<i>We need to get you out now.</i>

22:48.291 --> 22:49.500
Stay with me!

23:13.458 --> 23:14.875
What the hell did you do
out there?

23:14.875 --> 23:16.250
Completed the Red Cell mission.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.458
- You went dark on us.
- Dead Hand is locked down.

23:18.458 --> 23:20.083
Then why doesn't Citadel
have operational control

23:20.083 --> 23:21.875
- of the missiles?
- Because I do.

23:21.875 --> 23:24.000
I used a secondary protocol interrupt.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.875
Only I can unlock it.

23:25.875 --> 23:28.375
I'll give it to you right now
if you tell me where she is.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.000
I've told you, she's in Berlin.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.625
Do you think I'm lying to you?

23:35.625 --> 23:36.625
Yes, I do.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.125
Then we're at an impasse.

23:39.166 --> 23:40.416
You need to speak to someone.

23:40.416 --> 23:42.916
Anyone. I don't care who,
but you need help.

23:42.916 --> 23:44.625
You have lost her,
you understand?

23:44.625 --> 23:45.916
And if you're not careful,

23:45.916 --> 23:47.875
you're gonna lose yourself, too.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.958
<i>Christoph says
to meet</i>

23:52.958 --> 23:55.791
under the overpass at
the City of Arts and Sciences.

23:55.791 --> 23:57.666
Under 30 till the exchange.

23:59.958 --> 24:01.291
Are you okay?

24:01.291 --> 24:03.208
Yeah.

24:04.958 --> 24:07.625
Great. I'll set our
landing coordinates now.

24:35.166 --> 24:36.625
Christoph,
they're arriving

24:36.625 --> 24:38.416
from the south entrance.

24:38.416 --> 24:39.875
<i>[speakerphone] And
where are the nuclear cores?</i>

24:39.875 --> 24:41.583
They have the cores with them.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.916
<i>Good, we'll get the cores,
we can begin the final phase.</i>

24:43.916 --> 24:45.666
I hope this pleases
the families.

24:45.666 --> 24:48.416
<i>Your associate, Davik, nearly
threatened our entire mission.</i>

24:48.416 --> 24:51.458
<i>Let's get the cores and see
how pleased they are with you.</i>

25:03.375 --> 25:04.458
I got you.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.250
Where's my girl?

25:18.291 --> 25:20.125
Asha.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.416
Now, the cores.

25:23.791 --> 25:25.333
I got a shot.

25:30.291 --> 25:33.041
Do not hand over that child
until you've verified the cores.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.416
If anything goes awry, drop her.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.541
They've been encrypted.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.958
They've done something to them.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.500
I knew you would try
to be clever.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.208
Once Mason Kane,
always Mason Kane.

25:47.750 --> 25:48.916
<i>Why doesn't Citadel
have operational control</i>

25:48.916 --> 25:50.916
- of the missiles?
- Because I do.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.875
Unlock the weapons or she dies.

25:53.875 --> 25:56.041
I don't know how
but I'll find a way.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.375
You think I'm bluffing?
I will kill her.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.541
Mason Kane's
in here somewhere.

25:59.541 --> 26:00.958
Do what you want
to get him out of me,

26:00.958 --> 26:02.291
just let the girl go.

26:02.291 --> 26:04.458
Carter, take it.

26:04.458 --> 26:05.875
Kyle! Get her!

26:34.541 --> 26:36.125
Hi.

26:44.541 --> 26:47.750
I'm so sorry.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.708
I'm so sorry.

26:53.541 --> 26:55.750
Thank you.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.541
<i>Well, the things we do
for family, right?</i>

27:01.875 --> 27:05.250
Joe always hated me doing this.

27:05.250 --> 27:09.250
She thought it was a complete
waste of my time,

27:09.250 --> 27:13.166
to sift through the muck
to find that one

27:13.166 --> 27:16.500
last little... morsel.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.708
Look at that.

27:22.791 --> 27:24.375
How's Val?

27:24.375 --> 27:25.750
Oh, you know.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.375
Eight going on 18.

27:28.375 --> 27:31.250
She wants to get
her ears pierced.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.000
Why the rush to grow up?
I don't know.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
It's just earrings.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.875
Earrings are the gateway.

27:36.916 --> 27:41.291
Sometimes I just want
to tuck her away and...

27:41.291 --> 27:43.708
put her someplace
where no one can ever hurt her.

27:43.708 --> 27:47.333
When you have kids, you do
anything to keep them safe.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.750
What am I looking at?

27:57.750 --> 28:00.916
Well, I went to that address
in Spain that you gave me...

28:00.916 --> 28:02.208
and Nadia was there.

28:05.125 --> 28:07.125
And so was she.

28:10.666 --> 28:12.291
That's your daughter.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.250
That's why Nadia left?

28:24.500 --> 28:26.333
To have a baby?

28:31.208 --> 28:33.208
Our baby?

28:36.625 --> 28:37.875
I thought you might
want that, too.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.458
It's a round-trip ticket
to Spain.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.291
Clearly,
she's made her decision.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.791
What?

28:49.791 --> 28:53.041
You were so desperate to find
her and now you're not gonna go?

28:54.791 --> 28:56.875
She didn't think I was good
enough to be the kid's father.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.541
No, no, no, no. No.

28:58.541 --> 29:00.375
You prove her wrong.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.666
You have to fight
for your family.

29:02.666 --> 29:04.708
So I fly to Valencia, then what?

29:04.708 --> 29:06.666
Beg to be part
of this kid's life?

29:07.708 --> 29:08.750
Yeah.

29:08.750 --> 29:11.250
That's what you do.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.750
Where did they take Nana?

29:21.791 --> 29:23.291
I don't know, sweetheart.

29:24.333 --> 29:25.625
But I'm gonna find him.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.416
Will he be okay?

29:29.583 --> 29:32.833
Your grandfather is the
toughest person I've ever met.

29:32.833 --> 29:36.916
And if there is any way
of getting back to you...

29:36.916 --> 29:38.833
he's gonna find it.

29:38.833 --> 29:41.125
That's what he used to say
about you.

30:22.416 --> 30:25.041
Christoph didn't
answer my call.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.791
It's too quiet.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.458
Will there be
repercussions?

30:36.041 --> 30:40.000
There's always repercussions
for failure, my dear.

30:41.041 --> 30:44.666
<i>The key is to adapt
before they arrive.</i>

30:46.333 --> 30:49.208
<i>They can't kill
what's already dead.</i>

31:21.666 --> 31:23.625
Where are we?

31:26.750 --> 31:29.375
This used to be our home.

31:37.791 --> 31:39.041
Dad!

31:40.750 --> 31:42.666
Hendrix.

32:12.791 --> 32:14.333
Let me see you, let me see you.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.916
How is that his wife?

32:25.291 --> 32:28.416
Everyone,
this is Abby and Hendrix.

32:29.458 --> 32:30.541
Hi.

32:30.541 --> 32:33.291
Thank you for keeping him safe.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.250
Of course.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.291
Kyle,
I got something here.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.166
Your activation vial.

32:42.166 --> 32:44.791
Orlick had me create
a backup server,

32:44.791 --> 32:46.833
so I recoded it
to your genetic profile.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.958
What are you saying?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.875
He figured out
how to bring Mason back.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.583
So you're really gonna do it?

33:06.625 --> 33:08.500
I have to.

33:09.416 --> 33:11.625
Why?

33:13.375 --> 33:15.791
Because I don't know who I am.

33:15.791 --> 33:17.458
Yes, you do.

33:18.500 --> 33:19.666
You're Kyle Conroy.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.583
You're a father,
you're my husband.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.333
That's not gonna change.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.000
You're good to go.

33:41.708 --> 33:44.333
Time for me to meet Mason Kane.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.000
<i>Well,
come on.</i>

33:57.000 --> 33:58.125
Up you get.

33:58.125 --> 34:00.625
<i>[over TV] Isn't it easier
to go forward</i>

34:00.625 --> 34:01.708
<i>when you know you can't go back?</i>

34:01.708 --> 34:03.875
Your father
used to sleep till 2:00.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.000
I miss him.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.208
<i>Is my mom coming back soon?</i>

34:07.208 --> 34:09.250
<i>I was five years old
when my dad died</i>

34:09.250 --> 34:12.458
<i>and my mom left
like I didn't exist.</i>

34:12.458 --> 34:16.250
<i>I met you and I knew who I was.</i>

34:16.250 --> 34:18.916
<i>- Do I scare you?
- Now why would
you scare me?</i>

34:18.916 --> 34:20.250
<i>Because I'm starting
to see you.</i>

34:20.250 --> 34:23.333
<i>- See past the mask.
- What mask?</i>

34:23.333 --> 34:25.000
Oh, there are dozens.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.833
- This our new Tier One?
- Mm-hmm.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.833
<i>Mason,
meet Celeste Graham.</i>

34:28.833 --> 34:30.500
<i>- You never
should have brought me on.</i>
- Last chance!

34:30.500 --> 34:32.166
<i>That wasn't
a fucking interrogation!</i>

34:32.166 --> 34:34.166
That was an assault
on one of our own!

34:34.166 --> 34:35.583
<i>So you just killed
the person that she was?</i>

34:35.583 --> 34:37.791
<i>To protect you,
because I love you.</i>

34:37.791 --> 34:39.791
<i>You don't love me.</i>

34:41.125 --> 34:42.125
Well, I went
to that address in Spain

34:42.125 --> 34:43.208
that you gave me

34:43.208 --> 34:44.416
<i>and Nadia was there.</i>

34:44.416 --> 34:45.541
We were set up.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.250
<i>They're burning Citadel
to the ground.</i>

34:47.250 --> 34:48.583
<i>I've lost everything
I've ever cared about,</i>

34:48.583 --> 34:50.416
<i>I won't lose you.
I lied to you.</i>

34:50.416 --> 34:51.875
<i>I lied to you.</i>

35:06.833 --> 35:08.666
<i>You have to fight
for your family.</i>

35:08.666 --> 35:10.208
I appreciate the advice

35:10.208 --> 35:12.666
but I'm full up
of things to fight for.

35:13.708 --> 35:16.000
Thanks for the intel
on Nadia, though.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.958
What are you thanking me for?

35:18.958 --> 35:20.750
I only looked
where you told me to look.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.666
How did you know where she was?

35:38.916 --> 35:41.166
It's a long time
since I've had...

35:41.166 --> 35:43.458
someone to pour lemonade for.

35:47.416 --> 35:49.333
You look different than on TV.

35:49.333 --> 35:52.208
Oh, well, they pile
the makeup on like a clown.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.541
Never liked it much.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.291
I've watched you
all these years.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.458
It's amazing
what you've accomplished.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.583
Who you've become.

36:00.583 --> 36:02.041
It's not without sacrifices.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.083
And you?

36:06.125 --> 36:08.875
I wouldn't even know
where to look.

36:08.875 --> 36:12.125
Not when your trade
is being a ghost.

36:14.916 --> 36:19.041
But you do look...
just like him.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.416
I've come for a favor.

36:23.458 --> 36:25.291
A favor?

36:25.291 --> 36:27.750
You once said that if I ever
needed, I could call and...

36:27.750 --> 36:29.250
Yeah, no. I know what I said.

36:29.250 --> 36:32.125
I just thought
that you coming here today...

36:34.583 --> 36:36.041
I don't know what I thought.

36:40.541 --> 36:42.833
I need to find someone.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.833
A woman.

36:45.875 --> 36:48.458
Why... why...

36:48.458 --> 36:52.791
why is a spy coming to see
a diplomat to find a woman?

36:52.791 --> 36:54.500
I mean, isn't this
the kind of thing

36:54.500 --> 36:56.208
the diplomat hires a spy to do?

36:56.208 --> 36:58.666
She's a spy, too.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.458
Ah.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.166
And Citadel won't tell you
where she is.

37:03.166 --> 37:06.083
- It's your own agency.
- It's complicated.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.958
Does she have a name,
this woman?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.916
Nadia Sinh.

37:12.958 --> 37:14.583
Do you love her?

37:16.291 --> 37:18.875
She's my wife.

37:21.291 --> 37:22.833
Then I'll find her for you.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.250
Thank you.

37:31.541 --> 37:35.791
It's devastating to lose
the person you love most.

37:35.791 --> 37:39.083
I woke up from a dream
when the first explosion hit.

37:40.875 --> 37:43.958
He was next to me... Thomas.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.166
Already in flames.

37:46.166 --> 37:49.041
I tried to put it out...

37:53.083 --> 37:57.541
They grafted...
from every part of me.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.791
Cut and sewed and patched.

37:59.791 --> 38:03.083
And it was like they...
they reorganized me.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.416
Randomized and different

38:05.416 --> 38:07.083
until I became
another woman altogether,

38:07.083 --> 38:09.250
and yet this different woman

38:09.250 --> 38:13.791
still carries on
the same awful memories.

38:15.416 --> 38:17.833
After it happened,
why didn't you go home?

38:17.833 --> 38:19.583
Do you want the truth?

38:19.583 --> 38:21.166
I do.

38:25.916 --> 38:29.083
After it happened...

38:29.083 --> 38:33.250
I wasn't the same person
any longer.

38:34.291 --> 38:36.000
It wasn't my home any longer.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.208
What about your son?

38:40.250 --> 38:41.208
What about him?

38:41.208 --> 38:44.250
Was he yours any longer?

38:49.208 --> 38:51.291
Am I still yours, Mother?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.583
There's my boy.

38:58.625 --> 39:01.666
I thought that you must have
just lost it over the years.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.208
I didn't lose it.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.833
I buried it.

39:04.833 --> 39:07.583
The Queen's English
isn't something you bury.

39:08.833 --> 39:12.041
I didn't realize that you chose

39:12.041 --> 39:14.375
to become someone new altogether.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.583
To give up on who you were.

39:16.583 --> 39:18.291
Like you did.

39:21.708 --> 39:23.583
This is what they do, Citadel.

39:23.583 --> 39:25.500
They take the people
we love most.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.791
They didn't take her.

39:26.791 --> 39:30.041
No, I didn't mean her, love.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.458
I meant your father.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.166
What are you talking about?

39:38.166 --> 39:42.458
They said it was a far-right
Serbian terror cell

39:42.458 --> 39:44.833
that set off two car bombs
led by a man...

39:44.833 --> 39:47.000
Stankovic. I know.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.500
A few years ago,

39:48.500 --> 39:52.750
I met a former diplomat
in Serbia who, drunk one night,

39:52.750 --> 39:55.833
tells me that the ballistics
report from that awful day

39:55.833 --> 39:59.666
reveal that it wasn't a car bomb
that destroyed that building

39:59.666 --> 40:02.166
but three air missiles.

40:02.166 --> 40:05.708
Stankovic didn't have
the resources for drone strikes.

40:05.708 --> 40:09.541
So I looked a little deeper
and, wouldn't you know,

40:09.541 --> 40:12.708
there was a communique
between Citadel and NATO

40:12.708 --> 40:15.458
stating Citadel's intent
to launch air strikes

40:15.458 --> 40:17.916
on a Serbian terror cell.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.625
But the thing is,
they had the wrong coordinates.

40:20.625 --> 40:23.250
So instead of decimating
a terrorist's compound,

40:23.250 --> 40:27.458
they killed 157 men, women,
children and infants,

40:27.458 --> 40:30.083
all of them UN workers
and their families.

40:30.083 --> 40:31.250
They wouldn't.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.708
Well, then how do you explain

40:32.708 --> 40:35.583
the documents, and missives,
and confessions

40:35.583 --> 40:40.166
that Citadel blackmailed NATO,
the CIA, the UN,

40:40.166 --> 40:42.125
all to cover up the bombings.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.250
They knew, Mason.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.041
Everyone knew.

40:46.041 --> 40:48.666
And yet the world
let an unchecked,

40:48.666 --> 40:51.125
amoral, murderous spy agency

40:51.125 --> 40:52.916
get away with taking
the man I loved,

40:52.916 --> 40:55.458
for me to watch
as he lay burning to death

40:55.458 --> 40:57.750
with you in the other room.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.708
But you can stop it, Mason.

41:01.708 --> 41:05.583
You have access
to Citadel's secrets.

41:05.583 --> 41:08.458
Use it to bring Citadel
into the light

41:08.458 --> 41:10.833
and finally
hold them accountable

41:10.833 --> 41:12.708
for what they've done.

41:14.875 --> 41:17.041
Give me Citadel's secrets

41:17.041 --> 41:19.958
and I'll bring it to
the high court in the UK

41:19.958 --> 41:23.166
to open an investigation
into the crimes and misdemeanors

41:23.166 --> 41:25.583
of Citadel writ large.

41:27.208 --> 41:31.333
We can finally get justice
for your father, for you.

41:34.208 --> 41:35.833
How many more times, Mason,

41:35.833 --> 41:38.250
are they gonna get away with
taking the people we love

41:38.250 --> 41:40.250
before we do something?

41:48.041 --> 41:50.000
I've just
transferred the list.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.833
All Citadel agents,
real identities, whereabouts.

41:54.833 --> 41:57.333
Take them out.

42:06.583 --> 42:07.625
We were set up.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.083
They're burning Citadel
to the ground.

42:09.083 --> 42:10.916
We were double-crossed
by one of our own,

42:10.916 --> 42:12.541
who transferred the names of all

42:12.541 --> 42:14.208
the Citadel spies
into the wrong hands.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.333
<i>Bernard said the
Citadel hit was an inside job.</i>

42:16.333 --> 42:18.708
That someone turned
but he didn't know who.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.208
<i>Didn't know who.</i>

42:20.208 --> 42:21.583
<i>[over phone] Where'd you
get this?</i>

42:21.583 --> 42:24.041
Mason Kane.

42:44.125 --> 42:46.625
Do you remember?

42:56.916 --> 42:58.708
I don't know.

43:00.833 --> 43:02.625
I don't know.
