00:07.849 --> 00:11.247
Hollywood

00:11.249 --> 00:17.049
boulevard was a buzz when Simon
cowell received an iconic star

00:17.049 --> 00:20.649
on the Hollywood walk of fame.
Thank you all of you.

00:20.649 --> 00:23.449
It means a lot to me.
Thank you.

00:23.449 --> 00:26.379
You killed it tonight.
This was amazing.

00:26.379 --> 00:36.109
This is wow.
Heidi: I'm so proud of you.

00:36.109 --> 00:42.709
Simon: That was brilliant,
fantastic.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.679
Mel: So ready.
Howie: So ready.

00:46.679 --> 01:00.079
Mel: Come on.
♪♪♪♪

01:00.079 --> 01:05.679
Simon: The end goal here has
to be Vegas.

01:05.679 --> 01:10.549
Announcer: Live from
Hollywood, it's "America's got

01:10.549 --> 01:38.949
talent"!
Here's your host, Tyra banks.

01:43.434 --> 01:50.437
Tyra: This is Hollywood, and
this is "agt."

01:50.439 --> 01:54.579
Okay people, it's simple --
this is the last chance for any

01:54.579 --> 01:56.639
of our acts to be voted into the
semi-finals.

01:56.639 --> 01:59.739
They're gonna walk out here
tonight, knowing that if they

01:59.739 --> 02:02.509
nail it, they could be one step
closer to being a major new

02:02.509 --> 02:08.008
star.
But if they mess up --

02:08.008 --> 02:10.479
no.
We're not even going to go

02:10.479 --> 02:13.379
there.
We're not going to think about

02:13.379 --> 02:15.239
that.
The pressure is on, though.

02:15.239 --> 02:17.039
And all of the acts know -- the
world is watching.

02:17.039 --> 02:19.109
This is a big night and we're
gonna get big opinions down at

02:19.109 --> 02:20.809
the desk.
Let's hear it for our "agt"

02:20.809 --> 02:29.209
judges --
Howie mandel, Mel b, Heidi Klum

02:29.209 --> 02:37.179
and Simon Cowell!
All right.

02:37.179 --> 02:45.979
So there was some big showbiz
news this week -- Simon, you got

02:45.979 --> 02:47.009
a star on the
Hollywood walk of fame.

02:47.009 --> 02:53.339
Simon, how did that feel?
Simon: I feel like I'm living

02:53.339 --> 02:57.139
the dream.
It was a blast, and I'm

02:57.139 --> 02:59.839
grateful.
Tyra: And it's there forever

02:59.839 --> 03:04.739
and ever, Simon.
Simon: That is amazing.

03:04.739 --> 03:09.909
Tyra: This is a spot not on
the Hollywood walk of fame but

03:09.909 --> 03:12.139
the semifinals.
Coming up,

03:12.139 --> 03:14.409
these guys are more than a dance
crew -- they're a dance family,

03:14.409 --> 03:16.579
with a connection that goes way
beyond the dance floor.

03:16.579 --> 03:20.639
It's the future kingz.
Our family is everything to

03:20.639 --> 03:22.579
us.
Coming from bad neighborhoods,

03:22.579 --> 03:26.209
there was a lot of gang
violence.

03:26.209 --> 03:29.109
It was a full time job just to
stay out of trouble.

03:29.109 --> 03:33.009
That's why we started the future
kingz.

03:33.009 --> 03:38.879
It made us feel safe.
It gave us hope for the future.

03:38.879 --> 03:41.209
See you all next week.
It made us a family.

03:41.209 --> 03:43.439
Some of us are already
brothers.

03:43.439 --> 03:48.079
Come on, we got to go.
We all rely on each other.

03:48.079 --> 03:50.279
Blood couldn't make us any
closer.

03:50.279 --> 03:54.509
We got to go, man.
We take pride knowing we have

03:54.509 --> 03:59.779
each other's backs and that's
what keeps us focussed.

03:59.779 --> 04:02.939
We wouldn't be able to make it
this far without this family.

04:02.939 --> 04:06.839
Now that we're at the live
shows, we know that anything is

04:06.839 --> 04:10.339
possible together.
We're here to when "America's

04:10.339 --> 04:14.639

strength and loyalty.

07:18.395 --> 07:21.195
I love how cool and edgy you

Heidi: I liked it.

07:29.125 --> 07:32.265

Simon: For me it's about

07:53.325 --> 08:00.825
being real.
Actions speak louder than words.

08:00.825 --> 08:03.125
Heidi: The sparks are flying
back and forth.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.195
I think you have a hit right
there.

08:06.195 --> 08:21.665
Simon: This is one of the
most incredible things I

08:21.665 --> 08:26.095
..

08:29.865 --> 08:32.065
..

08:37.825 --> 08:41.695
We mean that.
All right, so now being on the

08:41.695 --> 08:45.495
agt live shows is a big deal.
But it's not the only life

08:45.495 --> 08:47.995
changing event these next two
singers have in their future.

08:47.995 --> 08:54.595
They are us the duo.
Is that the heartbeat?

08:54.595 --> 08:57.165
The fluttering?
Yes.

08:57.165 --> 09:00.095
That's her heartbeat.
Hearing the heartbeat for the

09:00.095 --> 09:05.165
first time, oh, my gosh.
We get to hear so many beautiful

09:05.165 --> 09:07.295
sounds.
By far, that is my favorite

09:07.295 --> 09:11.295
sound that I have ever heard.
Oh, my gosh.

09:11.295 --> 09:13.825
That's amazing.
Having a baby come into this

09:13.825 --> 09:16.965
world changes the way I think
about things.

09:16.965 --> 09:20.195
Being a musician definitely has
ups and downs.

09:20.195 --> 09:23.825
Financially, you never know when
the paycheck is going to come.

09:23.825 --> 09:26.425
So that's why "America's got
talent" is so important to us.

are stable or not.

The song talks about me wanting

the baby to be just like her
because I know as soon as I hold

09:43.765 --> 09:48.225
the baby in my arms that I'm
going to look into her eyes and

09:48.225 --> 09:51.165

love it.
We love it.

13:25.095 --> 13:29.225
Howie: Out of your
performances this is by far the

13:29.225 --> 13:30.725
favorite.
This was wonderful.

13:30.725 --> 13:35.065
Thank you!
Howie: I don't know if it's

13:35.065 --> 13:39.825
that you're carrying and your
reproduction is a wonderful

What do you think about ma mommy

I want you to vote for my mama

That's exactly what she said.

Tyra: So here is an act who
got sent home after the last

14:35.925 --> 14:36.825
round.
But then the judges got

14:36.825 --> 14:41.925
together, they argued, they
fought, it actually got

14:41.925 --> 14:44.625
physical -- well, not real
physical.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.165
But, you know, they all decided
to bring him back as a wild

14:47.165 --> 14:48.165
card.
And you're about to hear why.

14:48.165 --> 14:54.325
Here's Daniel Emmet.
Most teenagers don't fall in

14:54.325 --> 14:58.595
love with classical music, but
once I started singing, I never

14:58.595 --> 15:02.395
wanted to stop.
After my performance at judge

15:02.395 --> 15:05.625
cuts, I felt great.
I gave it everything I had.

15:05.625 --> 15:10.825
But it just wasn't enough.
Simon: I'm going to cut to

15:10.825 --> 15:14.495
the chase, Daniel, you haven't
made it through.

15:14.495 --> 15:20.695
It was heartbreaking.
Howie: Don't give up.

15:20.695 --> 15:25.295
But this journey is not over.
Now I find out I'm back on the

15:25.295 --> 15:27.525
show.
I'm the wild card.

15:27.525 --> 15:30.525
It is beyond my wildest
expectations.

15:30.525 --> 15:35.425
As a wild card there's even more
pressure to prove that I deserve

15:35.425 --> 15:38.595
to be in the competition.
I've been training harder, I've

15:38.595 --> 15:43.095
been training longer.
Make that note better, hold this

15:43.095 --> 15:44.795
note longer.
Do it again.

15:44.795 --> 15:47.495

It has to be right.

performing I've never attempted

15:52.265 --> 15:54.625
before.
It's something I feel comes from

15:54.625 --> 15:57.025

Every note has to be perfect.

I wish you would have started
off quieter so the key change

19:56.065 --> 20:00.625
would have been more dramatic,
'cause you can sing.

back.

Still to come, we have an

unforgettable and brave
violinist and an act who lives

At the auditions, he terrified

Growing up with a single mom
supporting a family of four,

21:38.265 --> 21:40.825
it's not easy.
I had to play violin on the

Mel: So this was your

42:22.787 --> 42:25.847
original song?
You wrote this song yourself?

42:25.847 --> 42:29.347
Yes, I did.
Mel: Who's it about if I may

42:29.347 --> 42:32.547
ask.
It's about a girl back home

42:32.547 --> 42:35.817
that I had a crush on at some
point.

42:35.817 --> 42:37.447
Mel: Are you together?
I wish.

42:37.447 --> 42:43.687
Simon: What's her name.
Mel: Don't make him say the

42:43.687 --> 42:47.547
name.
Tyra: Totally say the name.

42:47.547 --> 42:51.787
Say the name is.
Her name is Brianna.

42:51.787 --> 42:56.687
Mel: Hopefully she hears this
song because the lyrics were

42:56.687 --> 42:58.317
flawless.
I was tearing up a little bit.

42:58.317 --> 42:59.847
I don't know what's going on
tonight.

42:59.847 --> 43:01.487
Very good.
Thank you.

43:01.487 --> 43:03.917
Tyra: Heidi?
Heidi: It was sweet.

43:03.917 --> 43:07.887
It didn't knock me out of my
seat, but it was sweet.

43:07.887 --> 43:10.947
Thank you.
Mel: It was about love.

43:10.947 --> 43:13.447
I want somebody to write a song
like that about me.

43:13.447 --> 43:16.317
Tyra: Simon.
Simon: Joseph, I like you.

43:16.317 --> 43:20.317
You're probably going to hook up
now with Brianna, so that's the

43:20.317 --> 43:23.787
good news.
The not so good news is I

43:23.787 --> 43:26.747
personally didn't love the song.
Maybe it's one of those songs

43:26.747 --> 43:30.047
you have to hear two or three
times --

43:30.047 --> 43:34.347
[ booing ]
Simon: Oh, shut up.

43:34.347 --> 43:36.617
Mel: It's a beautiful love
song.

43:36.617 --> 43:39.417
Simon: You stuck to what you
wanted to do and I applaud you

43:39.417 --> 43:42.817
for that, but I'm not sure that
performance is going to get you

43:42.817 --> 43:43.647
through.
Thank you.

43:43.647 --> 43:45.647
Tyra: What do you think,
Howie?

43:45.647 --> 43:47.587
Howie: I'm agreeing with
Simon.

43:47.587 --> 43:50.987
It's about the dynamics.
This show from the beginning has

43:50.987 --> 43:54.247
been through the roof.
Hopefully it works for Brianna,

43:54.247 --> 44:00.247
but you have a giant doily, any
way it doesn't matter.

44:00.247 --> 44:01.347
Let's move on.
Tyra: Good luck tonight,

44:59.147 --> 45:03.787
My regular dancers could not be
here, so today I'm holding an

45:03.787 --> 45:07.287
open call audition.
Do you think this is good enough

45:07.287 --> 45:09.217
for Simon Cowell?
I don't.

45:09.217 --> 45:13.447
These are the live shows I need
the best talents in America, and

45:13.447 --> 45:18.547
this is what's shown up today.
I need the Vegas headlining

show.
You got me?

45:20.117 --> 45:23.987
This isn't a game anymore.
This is for a million dollars.

45:23.987 --> 45:27.547

most spectacular thing America

45:27.547 --> 45:31.787
has ever seen.
Dolby theatre.

45:31.787 --> 45:34.317

this perfect.

said.
Let me translate.

Heidi was saying, she cannot
tell who of us is the super

49:07.087 --> 49:08.517

who this would be.

I was saying to Howie, what song

50:07.747 --> 50:11.817
is it?
At spice girls we write our own

50:11.817 --> 50:15.817
material, I didn't recognize our
own song but you killed it.

Only seven will go through and

50:57.987 --> 51:02.487

"Agt" really does change the

something back is just as
important as winning.

51:21.787 --> 51:30.947
It's udi dance.
Dance brought us together and

51:30.947 --> 51:36.047
saved us.
We grew up in Siberia.

51:36.047 --> 51:38.487
The Russian government had
fallen.

51:38.487 --> 51:43.947
There was drugs and crime and
really few opportunities.

51:43.947 --> 51:49.187
I grew up in the orphanage and I
was all alone.

51:49.187 --> 51:53.517
But I found dance.
And dance gave me my family.

51:53.517 --> 52:00.347
Together we started a dance
school for children like us.

52:00.347 --> 52:04.147
We wanted to show other children
the light.

52:04.147 --> 52:08.347
We wanted to give them
opportunity.

52:08.347 --> 52:11.247
We believe these children can
change the world.

means everything to us.

much.

You want my honest opinion?
This wasn't as good as your

first audition.
I really mean that.

55:20.347 --> 55:23.347
You have to remember, this show
isn't just about the million

dollars, it's about going to
Vegas.

55:25.917 --> 55:29.817
I've seen acts do it better.
If you are to go through to the

things up.

55:57.717 --> 56:01.187
love what you do.
I love the part where you were

spinning in the middle and
things were coming off you.

the a-ha song.

liked.

But I do love you.

56:17.247 --> 56:21.417
video game idea was great but
the execution wasn't maybe as

56:21.417 --> 56:24.147
great as the idea.
I agree with Simon as well.

56:24.147 --> 56:28.217
I liked it better before on
previous --

56:28.217 --> 56:30.687
Tyra: Okay.
So they're saying that you were

56:30.687 --> 56:32.417
stronger before.
What do you want to say to

everyone at home so they vote
for you so you can get better.

56:37.947 --> 56:43.387

Now I want you to close your

57:28.087 --> 57:29.917
eyes and I want you to imagine
yourself doing just that.

57:29.917 --> 57:31.647
It can happen.
We'll be auditioning for next

57:31.647 --> 57:35.347
season all across the country
really soon.

57:35.347 --> 57:38.087
Go to agtauditions. Com to submit
a video online and to find out

57:38.087 --> 57:42.417
everything you need to know.
Because we want to see what you

57:42.417 --> 57:47.517
can do, baby.
Now, acts perform for all kinds

57:47.517 --> 57:51.917
of reasons, but this singer has
the absolute best possible

57:51.917 --> 57:55.247
motivation.
She's Christina Wells.

57:55.247 --> 57:59.017
My biggest inspiration
definitely is my mother.

57:59.017 --> 58:03.947
When I was about 3 1/2, my
father was killed in a car

58:03.947 --> 58:07.387
accident, and all of a sudden my
mom had two little girls to take

58:07.387 --> 58:11.047
care of by herself.
We didn't have a lot of money.

58:11.047 --> 58:14.187
We were on food stamps.
We had to learn how to

58:14.187 --> 58:17.287
survive.
I tried to make it so that you

58:17.287 --> 58:19.547
didn't feel how tough things
were.

58:19.547 --> 58:23.247
She was worried, I'm sure,
about bills and keeping the

58:23.247 --> 58:26.217
lights on.
But she just didn't show it.

58:26.217 --> 58:29.587
We danced and we laughed and we
had a great time.

58:29.587 --> 58:35.387
That spoke of her love more than
any words ever could.

58:35.387 --> 58:40.117
You did a great job.
Thank you.

58:40.117 --> 58:42.887
I'm glad you feel like that.
There were times when the

58:42.887 --> 58:45.887
rest of the world didn't believe
in me.

58:45.887 --> 58:48.087
There were times I didn't
believe in myself.

58:48.087 --> 58:50.717
But my mom has always believed
in me.

58:50.717 --> 58:54.247
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you, mama.

58:54.247 --> 58:57.717
Being here at "America's got
talent," this is the closest

58:57.717 --> 59:01.287
I've ever been to making my
life-long dream come true.

59:01.287 --> 59:03.417
I want to be a singer.
I want to say, I did it mama.

59:03.417 --> 59:17.687
I did it.

Tyra: Standing ovation!

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.517
Everyone is on their feet.
Do you see this?

01:01:33.517 --> 01:01:37.287
Do you see what you just did?
Howie?

01:01:37.287 --> 01:01:41.247
Howie: I can't believe
there's going to be more show

01:01:41.247 --> 01:01:42.617
tonight.
That was like a grand finale,

01:01:42.617 --> 01:01:46.117
that's the way to leave them --
you know you said in the package

01:01:46.117 --> 01:01:49.447
before you didn't believe in
yourself and sometimes it was

01:01:49.447 --> 01:01:51.147
only your mother who believed in
you.

01:01:51.147 --> 01:01:54.047
I think I'm speaking for an
entire country, I think we all

01:01:54.047 --> 01:02:00.987
believe in you now.
Tyra: Mel b?

01:02:00.987 --> 01:02:04.517
Mel: Where do I start?
My gosh, I adore you.

01:02:04.517 --> 01:02:10.317
I love you, your voice is
sensational.

01:02:10.317 --> 01:02:12.917
Your rage is massive.
You are incredible.

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:17.917
You made me cry.
I never heard that song before

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:24.247
but I understood every single
lir

01:02:24.247 --> 01:02:27.987
Lyric because you sang it from
your heart.

01:02:27.987 --> 01:02:31.547
Tyra: Heidi.
Heidi: You have changed so

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:34.087
much since the first time we
met.

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:37.187
That's not your voice.
Your voice has always been

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:38.387
there.
But your confidence.

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:40.917
Your confidence needed to catch
up and it finally did.

01:02:40.917 --> 01:02:44.747
Thank you, Heidi.
Tyra: Simon.

01:02:44.747 --> 01:02:48.817
Simon: Tonight you are the
diva I've always believed you

01:02:48.817 --> 01:02:51.287
are.
I mean that as the biggest

01:02:51.287 --> 01:02:53.387
compliment.
You owned the stage, you owned

01:02:53.387 --> 01:02:57.047
the song.
You put everyone -- anyone's who

01:02:57.047 --> 01:03:00.187
ever put you down, which we
spoke about before, after that

01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:03.647
they can you know what.
Mel: Exactly.

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:06.617
Simon: Because that's what
this show is all about, is

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.517
people like you being given an
opportunity.

01:03:08.517 --> 01:03:11.847
I think there's going to be a
lot of Broadway producers

01:03:11.847 --> 01:03:13.987
watching this show tonight
thinking I want to audition you.

01:03:13.987 --> 01:03:21.387
I do.
Tyra: So I see someone that

01:03:21.387 --> 01:03:24.187
means everything to you more
than anyone in the world.

01:03:24.187 --> 01:03:26.887
Mama in the audience.
What do you want to tell her

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:30.517
after this amazing performance
and feedback you got?

01:03:30.517 --> 01:03:34.017
What do you want to tell mommy
right now?

01:03:34.017 --> 01:03:38.787
Momma, you worked so hard for
us when we were little girls.

01:03:38.787 --> 01:03:44.087
She's my white mama.
It was a struggle in the '70s in

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:46.947
the south to have mixed
children, so you showed me what

01:03:46.947 --> 01:03:51.187
grace and dignity looked like.
Today I hope I made you proud.

01:03:51.187 --> 01:03:55.687
Thank you for being here and
believing in me.

01:03:55.687 --> 01:03:59.047
I love you mama.
Tyra: You spoke to so many

01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:01.087
kids, mixed kids.
All right.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.287
This is for a spot in the
semi-finals.

01:04:03.287 --> 01:04:05.517
There's a bunch of ways to vote
and new this year, you can vote

01:04:05.517 --> 01:04:07.017
using your xfinity x1 voice
remote.

01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:14.017
Go make some dreams come true.
Hi, mama!

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:18.787
Announcer: Coming up --
Howie: Wow!

01:04:18.787 --> 01:04:24.447
Tyra: This is so crazy.
You know what I have to do.

01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:27.447
Heidi: I am just blown away.
Simon: For me it's about

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:42.687
being real.
Tyra: At the auditions, it

01:04:42.687 --> 01:04:45.747
can be really difficult trying
to decide who to hit the golden

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:50.447
buzzer for.
But as soon as I saw this act,

01:04:50.447 --> 01:04:55.887
it was a done deal.
And guess what --

01:04:55.887 --> 01:05:00.817
their audition is now the most
viewed online in "agt" history

01:05:00.817 --> 01:05:07.647
with over 320 million views.
I got the eyes --

01:05:07.647 --> 01:05:14.717
here's my golden buzzer,
zurcaroh.

01:05:14.717 --> 01:05:16.417
zurcaroh is a family.

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:18.187
When people watch our
performance.

01:05:18.187 --> 01:05:22.487
They can feel that we are
connected with each other.

01:05:22.487 --> 01:05:25.187
Every member in the group is
important.

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:31.347
This makes our group special.
But if someone is missing, we

01:05:31.347 --> 01:05:38.687
are lost.
Since our last performance, two

01:05:38.687 --> 01:05:41.847
gymnasts in our group lost their
mother.

01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:50.147
For them, it was a hard moment.
But we are family, and we will

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:58.417
always support each other.
She knew how much they loved

01:05:58.417 --> 01:06:03.087
being zurcaroh.
So tonight, to have the entire

01:06:03.087 --> 01:06:08.017
group together on that stage, I
know she would be really proud.

01:06:08.017 --> 01:06:13.347
We are stronger when we are
together.

01:06:13.347 --> 01:06:18.047
Tonight we will be united and we
will give the performance of our

01:06:18.047 --> 01:06:25.987
life.

There's my angels and Adams and

Mel: Oh my gosh.

01:08:41.647 --> 01:08:48.386
First of all, Tyra, this is your
golden buzzer.

01:08:48.386 --> 01:08:52.287
Tyra: Yes, darling.
Mel: Well done to you.

01:08:52.287 --> 01:08:55.287

Are you like 7 years old.

And more babies over there.

Mel: Can I say it was
breathtaking.

01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:11.087
I love the music.
I love the outfits.

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:16.947
Tyra: Story line, too, Mel.
Mel: I got the story line.

01:09:16.947 --> 01:09:20.147
Tyra: Everyone give Mel an
applause, she got the story

01:09:20.147 --> 01:09:23.087
line.
Heidi?

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:27.046
Heidi: If there was an act
ready for Las Vegas, it's you

01:09:27.046 --> 01:09:29.046
guys.
You are perfect from the

01:09:29.046 --> 01:09:32.216
costumes to the makeup, the
masks, the dancing, the whole

01:09:32.216 --> 01:09:35.687
thing and the little girls.
All the kids, amazing.

01:09:35.687 --> 01:09:40.716
My goose bumps just won't go
down they're still up.

01:09:40.716 --> 01:09:42.017
Simon: True.
Tyra: Simon.

01:09:42.017 --> 01:09:43.947
Simon: Yeah, I didn't like
it.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:47.787
I loved it!
Heidi: He loved it.

01:09:47.787 --> 01:09:49.287
Simon: We don't have much
time.

01:09:49.287 --> 01:09:52.617
I'm going to say, this is one of
the best live performances I

01:09:52.617 --> 01:09:59.347
have ever seen on an "America's
got talent."

01:09:59.347 --> 01:10:01.647
Tyra: Howie?
Howie: I agree.

01:10:01.647 --> 01:10:04.017
They put dance to a whole new
level.

01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:07.717
You know how they say less is
more, you proved them wrong.

01:10:07.717 --> 01:10:12.017
More is more.
You had acrobatics, dancing, and

01:10:12.017 --> 01:10:23.147
a male Victoria's secret model
that's amazing zbliets Heidi,

01:10:23.147 --> 01:10:28.847
he's the first male angel.
How do you feel about all the

01:10:28.847 --> 01:10:32.547
love.
They're saying you're ready for

01:10:32.547 --> 01:10:35.887
Las Vegas.
We're blessed for everything

01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:37.887
we have.
We don't know when we're going

01:10:37.887 --> 01:10:46.587
to leave the competition with be
but our heart is full.

01:10:46.587 --> 01:10:48.587
Thank you for everything.
Tyra: You said you don't know

01:10:48.587 --> 01:10:54.287
when you're going to leave, I'll
fix that for you, you're not

01:10:54.287 --> 01:10:57.887
going to leave.
Good luck to my people,

01:10:57.887 --> 01:10:58.787
zurcaroh.
Let's keep it going.

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:00.247
Up next is a magician, and at
the auditions, Simon wasn't easy

01:11:00.247 --> 01:11:01.417
on him at all.
But he's made it here and he's

01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:02.917
looking to show you what he can
do.

01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:08.417
He's Rob lake.
This "agt" journey has been

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:11.517
exhausting and exciting and just
out of this world.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:19.617
When I first walked on the
stage, it was really a sense of

01:11:19.617 --> 01:11:22.417
vulnerability and pressure.
Simon said he loves the magic

01:11:22.417 --> 01:11:30.887
but has an issue with the thee
at

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:35.517
theeatrics of it.
And at judge cuts the same thing

01:11:35.517 --> 01:11:37.417
happened.
Simon: Maybe that's why you

01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:39.517
haven't been given the break
yet.

01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:44.817
It's all a bit corny.
It feels personal when

01:11:44.817 --> 01:11:47.547
someone makes a comment like
that.

01:11:47.547 --> 01:11:49.547
Because everything in this is
me.

01:11:49.547 --> 01:11:53.947
I think Simon is wrong.
Magic has to have the drama,

01:11:53.947 --> 01:12:00.017
it's part of the illusion.
I'm really at a loss for what is

01:12:00.017 --> 01:12:02.547
Simon wanting?
We have to get this right.

01:12:02.547 --> 01:12:05.317
Tonight I'm pulling out all the
stops.

01:12:05.317 --> 01:12:11.617
I'm hoping Simon will admit he's
wrong, because when I go on

01:12:11.617 --> 01:12:20.347
stage, I want to win.
I'm in this to win.

Tyra: Oh my goodness.

01:14:42.317 --> 01:14:45.917
Wow.
Good runway walk, girls.

01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:48.747
He's just appearing and
reappearing all over this place,

01:14:48.747 --> 01:14:56.817
Simon.
Thank you.

01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:59.447
Tyra: Tiesimon.
Simon: I feel I have kind of

01:14:59.447 --> 01:15:03.787
helped you get to this place.
Constructive, supportive, fair

01:15:03.787 --> 01:15:07.917
play, I think you put on a great
show on a live show.

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:12.747
It was a bit corny at times but
maybe that's who you are.

01:15:12.747 --> 01:15:16.917
I have no idea how you flew from
there --

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:21.217
Tyra: Simon!
Simon, come on!

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:24.917
Simon: I'm being nice.
Tyra: That's nice saying it's

01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:31.147
corny and that's who you are.
Simon: I'm saying it in a

01:15:31.147 --> 01:15:33.447
complimentary way.
Mel: It takes a corny one to

01:15:33.447 --> 01:15:36.317
know a corny one.
Tyra: Heidi?

01:15:36.317 --> 01:15:40.147
Heidi: I loved it.
It was like you were there and

01:15:40.147 --> 01:15:42.047
there.
It's like you were two of you.

01:15:42.047 --> 01:15:44.287
Like you have a twin.
I don't.

01:15:44.287 --> 01:15:50.147
I have one sister, she's here
tonight and she hates magic.

01:15:50.147 --> 01:15:55.047
Heidi: I love it, it was so
much things going on at the same

01:15:55.047 --> 01:15:58.787
time, I love it.
Otherwise I get bored.

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:04.287
Howie: I love the magic, the
show, the cheesiness was a bit

01:16:04.287 --> 01:16:08.047
many much for me.
It was the Ada and the dancing.

01:16:08.047 --> 01:16:13.487
It looked very '80s to me.
Tyra: Maybe that was the

01:16:13.487 --> 01:16:26.187
style, I'm very 1940s tonight.
Howie: It's not cheese

01:16:26.187 --> 01:16:28.017
superintendent -- cheesy.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.187
Mel: I didn't think it was
cheesy enough.

01:16:29.187 --> 01:16:30.217
Are you sure you don't have a
twin?

01:16:30.217 --> 01:16:33.547
I don't.
Mel: That was magic.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:38.147
Pure magic.
Tyra: Every vote counts get

01:16:38.147 --> 01:16:43.547
to voting.
Voting stays open until 7:00

01:16:43.547 --> 01:17:00.747
A.M. eastern time.
After the break, Simon's golden

01:17:00.747 --> 01:17:03.017
Tyra: Our last act tonight is
also our last golden buzzer of

01:17:03.017 --> 01:17:09.817
this season.
Big daddy Simon's golden buzzer.

01:17:09.817 --> 01:17:13.717
Why did you pick him?
Simon: I picked him

01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:16.387
because --
Mel: Because I told you to

01:17:16.387 --> 01:17:18.287
pick him.
Simon: He's actually just a

01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:24.317
great human being and a great
singer and I'm thrilled -- I'm

01:17:24.317 --> 01:17:28.417
so excited right now.
I really, really am.

01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:34.047
Tyra: Okay, here's
Michael ketterer.

01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:40.117
My dad -- before I met my dad
it was very hard.

01:17:40.117 --> 01:17:45.817
We used to imagine parents.
How come?

01:17:45.817 --> 01:17:53.047
It was really hard.

01:17:56.087 --> 01:18:00.247
I was living on the streets.
I know your favorite part is

01:18:00.247 --> 01:18:04.647
when we put the chocolate chips
in.

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:08.487
Whenever my dad's around me,
I always feel like I'm really

01:18:08.487 --> 01:18:10.617
safe.
Sometimes you got to make a

01:18:10.617 --> 01:18:12.147
mess to make something really
good.

01:18:12.147 --> 01:18:16.447
He's a super fun dad.
Doctors said he's not going

01:18:16.447 --> 01:18:18.187
to have a relationship with
anybody.

01:18:18.187 --> 01:18:21.047
Hi, daddy.
Look at him now.

01:18:21.047 --> 01:18:25.717
We've got cookies.
My family is why I'm here.

01:18:25.717 --> 01:18:28.387
When you're surviving you can't
dream.

01:18:28.387 --> 01:18:31.847
My dad shows me that dreams
sometimes come true.

01:18:31.847 --> 01:18:35.847
My dream is to get a good
education.

01:18:35.847 --> 01:18:39.617
My dream is to be a chef one
day.

01:18:39.617 --> 01:18:41.847
My dream is to be like my dad.

01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:45.887
And I feel like I can do that.
I think you're going to win

01:18:45.887 --> 01:19:05.017
the whole show, dad.

gosh.
Tyra: Let it out, Simon, it's

01:21:47.817 --> 01:21:49.687
okay.
Simon: As I dad I get -- I

01:21:49.687 --> 01:21:54.247
couldn't -- I can't imagine what
you've done and the fact that

01:21:54.247 --> 01:21:58.547
you're on this show and you
really need this and you're a

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:03.287
really, really special guy.
There's something about you.

01:22:03.287 --> 01:22:07.387
Tyra: Simon, that is one of
the most beautiful moments I

01:22:07.387 --> 01:22:12.787
have ever seen of you, that
vulnerability and beauty.

01:22:12.787 --> 01:22:16.517
That's what people don't know
about Mr. Cowl, that he's a big,

01:22:16.517 --> 01:22:30.887
soft papa.
Mel b. Why are you writing?

01:22:30.887 --> 01:22:34.147
Mel: I'm doodling so I don't
cry too much.

01:22:34.147 --> 01:22:39.617
To do what you've done, taking
on, adopting all these kids,

01:22:39.617 --> 01:22:42.917
giving them life and your voice
sings such truth and honesty.

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:48.047
You don't have the best voice
but what you do is you're

01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:52.787
captivating and you're honest,
I'm not going to try, I already

01:22:52.787 --> 01:22:56.047
cried.
I cried at the first word you

01:22:56.047 --> 01:22:57.687
said.
Tyra: Heidi?

01:23:00.887 --> 01:23:06.447

Howie: More humans like you.
You deserve to be here.

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:18.947
This is not a sob story, this is
a happy story.

01:23:18.947 --> 01:23:24.587
People should be inspired by
you.

01:23:24.587 --> 01:23:29.147
Tyra: So Michael, you made
Simon Cowell cry on national,

01:23:29.147 --> 01:23:32.847
live television.
What does that feel like?

01:23:32.847 --> 01:23:37.247
I mean, I know I think he
gets it, you know, these are my

01:23:37.247 --> 01:23:40.547
babies and I have given my
entire life to this, and I

01:23:40.547 --> 01:23:42.987
couldn't have done it without my
wife back there.

01:23:42.987 --> 01:23:48.547
She's one of my greatest
supports.

01:23:48.547 --> 01:23:51.317
And -- I don't know what else to
say.

01:23:51.317 --> 01:23:53.317
Tyra: I'll say it for you.
You have to vote.
