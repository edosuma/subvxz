02:55.416 --> 02:59.793
Small boat adrift! Starboard bow!

03:03.924 --> 03:06.250
Look! Off starboard!

03:19.398 --> 03:22.315
Up into the wind!
Get out the small boat!

03:22.943 --> 03:25.730
- Pull away!
- Pull away!

03:25.988 --> 03:27.530
Easy!

03:27.739 --> 03:30.028
Get that genny out!

03:54.641 --> 03:56.799
- Anyone aboard?
- I can't tell!

03:57.143 --> 04:00.892
Get that painter!
Pull that line, Kearney!

04:01.105 --> 04:03.810
Come on, get that boat in!

04:05.443 --> 04:06.818
Watch the sides!

04:07.070 --> 04:09.442
There's a man and a woman, sir!

04:09.656 --> 04:13.024
- Dead or alive?
- Dead, sir!

04:13.826 --> 04:16.946
- A child, sir!
- A what?

04:17.454 --> 04:18.735
Alive!

04:25.796 --> 04:29.664
- I'll take him.
- Thank you, ma'am.

04:40.519 --> 04:43.010
There. There, now.

04:49.194 --> 04:54.781
"We commit their bodies to the waters
to be turned into corruption...

04:55.033 --> 04:59.363
...looking for resurrection,
when the sea shall give up her dead...

04:59.580 --> 05:05.949
...and the life of the world to come,
through our lord, Jesus Christ. Amen."

05:31.528 --> 05:33.070
Captain.

05:34.531 --> 05:37.864
The surgeon would like
to speak with you, sir.

05:38.493 --> 05:40.781
There's sickness in the crew.

05:40.995 --> 05:44.245
Five more were taken down
since mid-watch.

05:44.499 --> 05:46.207
Fever. Canker sores.

05:46.417 --> 05:49.288
Your cabinet has bromide.
Leech it out.

05:49.504 --> 05:51.295
It's beyond bleeding.

05:51.839 --> 05:55.789
Mr. Penfield,
I look to your medical knowledge.

05:56.010 --> 05:59.758
After we left Moorea,
you thought it was scurvy.

06:00.014 --> 06:02.587
Then you said it was breakbone fever.

06:02.808 --> 06:06.142
The symptoms weren't for certain.
Now, I know.

06:06.395 --> 06:09.562
Fever. Withered skin.

06:09.815 --> 06:12.271
Black bile.

06:16.405 --> 06:18.528
Cholera.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.712
- Can't we turn back?
- There's no port for a plague ship.

06:32.921 --> 06:37.713
- Drop anchor at the first island.
- This is all open sea.

06:37.926 --> 06:42.718
With due respect, captain, that small
boat put off from somewheres.

06:44.182 --> 06:49.389
This is a French naval chart.
There's nothing but warnings.

06:49.604 --> 06:52.807
There's reefs. Atolls.

06:54.609 --> 07:00.979
This is a cruel turn for Mrs. Hargraves.
Left widowed with an infant.

07:01.241 --> 07:03.779
Cast them adrift.

07:05.245 --> 07:10.321
- A woman alone with two children?
- Put a man with them.

07:10.541 --> 07:12.534
Kearney's strong and able.

07:12.752 --> 07:15.373
At least that'll give them a chance.

07:16.047 --> 07:17.755
Kearney?

07:19.634 --> 07:22.338
Best of a poor lot.

07:23.596 --> 07:26.716
But keep it from the rest of the crew.

07:26.932 --> 07:29.637
- Wait till mid-watch.
- Aye, sir.

07:32.605 --> 07:37.231
Putting us off into the peril
of the sea because some men are ill?

07:37.443 --> 07:40.479
- This is madness!
- It's for your own good.

07:40.696 --> 07:44.824
I've spent the last three years
in a climate of awful heat...

07:45.034 --> 07:48.034
...with insects as big as rats,
rats as big as cats!

07:48.245 --> 07:52.457
I can certainly deal with some
deck hands down with fever!

07:53.167 --> 07:58.409
We're carrying cholera.
If you stay aboard, you'll die.

07:58.630 --> 08:03.837
You can't take your sea chest, missus.
Only things you really need.

08:04.261 --> 08:07.961
But everything we have
will be in this chest.

08:08.807 --> 08:12.176
Mrs. Hargraves will be taking
her belongings.

08:12.394 --> 08:14.267
Aye, sir.

08:18.233 --> 08:19.644
Cholera?

09:37.060 --> 09:41.805
Mr. Kearney?
Mr. Kearney, a cup of water, please.

09:42.649 --> 09:47.227
- There's only so much, missus.
- They're in sore need, Mr. Kearney.

09:48.113 --> 09:52.062
Look, the boy ain't yours,
so he don't matter too much.

09:52.283 --> 09:54.490
Your infant knows what to do.

09:54.953 --> 09:59.615
I'd say you're fresh. Let her suckle.

10:58.390 --> 11:02.139
I tell you, I'm sick and tired
of them two squalling.

11:02.352 --> 11:04.724
Then give them water.

11:05.439 --> 11:08.309
I'm a practical man, missus.

11:08.567 --> 11:12.611
If I was alone, by myself,
this could last a good while.

11:14.656 --> 11:18.025
Sharing four ways makes no sense.

11:19.202 --> 11:22.120
It's best to put them out
of their misery.

11:22.580 --> 11:25.451
You won't touch them.

11:26.668 --> 11:30.416
You either shut them up,
or they're going overboard!

11:30.672 --> 11:32.795
Hush, Lilli!

11:47.188 --> 11:51.055
That's it. Look the other way
if you don't want to see.

15:07.051 --> 15:11.380
Richard, come quickly. Jump up.

16:01.604 --> 16:03.561
You can help Mama.

16:03.773 --> 16:06.976
Yeah, that's my girl.

16:07.193 --> 16:08.901
Yes.

16:09.737 --> 16:11.813
Come on. Come on, Lilli.

17:09.253 --> 17:12.503
Richard, you stay here.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.630
It's fresh.

17:27.939 --> 17:30.893
Look! Bananas!

17:31.109 --> 17:36.565
And pompons! And roots!
Roots are good eating!

17:41.035 --> 17:44.618
This is taro root!
We ate it at the mission.

17:44.831 --> 17:48.164
And bananas.
Richard, here's some bananas!

17:48.376 --> 17:52.539
Yes, lots of bananas!

17:53.631 --> 17:54.662
Boat.

17:54.882 --> 17:57.551
Here, do you want some?

17:59.345 --> 18:01.551
The boat is coming.

18:06.936 --> 18:08.596
Boat!

18:09.855 --> 18:13.189
Look! How pretty.

18:17.279 --> 18:18.442
There.

18:20.407 --> 18:22.732
Oh, Lilli.

19:59.630 --> 20:02.168
We can't stay here.

20:02.424 --> 20:05.211
We're too exposed on this side.

20:07.054 --> 20:12.012
We've got to find a safe haven out
of the weather. Come on.

20:12.225 --> 20:16.437
Come, Richard.
Let's go for a little walk.

20:25.155 --> 20:27.278
Here we go.

21:15.454 --> 21:19.202
Look! How beautiful!

21:23.587 --> 21:25.461
House.

21:31.511 --> 21:34.596
Good heavens! Richard!

21:40.395 --> 21:42.352
Mama!

22:09.590 --> 22:11.963
Mama! Mama!

22:26.023 --> 22:28.858
She's gone.

22:29.068 --> 22:33.066
I know she's gone. Your mama's gone.

22:35.908 --> 22:40.451
It's all right. It's all right.
Come here, I've got you.

22:40.663 --> 22:45.574
- Mommy gone!
- I know. It's all right.

22:46.502 --> 22:52.207
Your mama's not here, but I am.
I'll be your mama from now on.

22:59.431 --> 23:03.180
Any passing ship will see this
when it's ablaze.

23:03.435 --> 23:07.018
It won't be long before one finds us.

23:39.679 --> 23:43.095
Go to sleep now. Close your eyes.

23:47.353 --> 23:49.761
I'll be right back.

25:00.508 --> 25:03.711
I know this is your favorite dessert,
but eat slower.

25:03.970 --> 25:09.213
And hold the spoon this way,
as I've showed you.

25:11.269 --> 25:16.511
Someday, you'll find yourself seated
at a fancy table in San Francisco...

25:16.732 --> 25:20.398
...and be expected
to show proper table manners.

25:22.572 --> 25:24.860
Richard! Don't do that!

25:34.625 --> 25:40.129
We may be away from civilization,
but we won't behave uncivilized!

25:55.687 --> 25:57.312
Full moon!

26:10.494 --> 26:14.278
They come every three months
when the moon is full.

26:17.083 --> 26:20.333
Off to bed, children. Quickly!

26:20.962 --> 26:23.085
Richard, come!

26:24.883 --> 26:30.125
It'll be all right. Tonight
you'll get your lullaby in the dark.

28:08.067 --> 28:10.226
The mother!

28:24.542 --> 28:26.250
Put it down!

28:36.804 --> 28:40.967
- Why do you wear clothes when bathing?
- It's proper.

28:41.225 --> 28:45.887
- Why don't Richard and I wear clothes?
- I gave up on you long ago.

28:46.105 --> 28:49.723
I put your clothes on
and you'd just take them off.

28:49.983 --> 28:52.901
- I wish I looked like him down there.
- Why?

28:53.153 --> 28:58.148
- He can aim when he goes:
- I can hit a mango leaf dead center.

28:59.868 --> 29:03.818
Why does he have one he can aim
and we don't?

29:04.331 --> 29:08.411
God, in his infinite wisdom,
decided...

29:10.212 --> 29:14.459
Well, nature gave us different parts.

29:16.092 --> 29:18.844
- You see, a female has a...
- A cowrie shell.

29:19.054 --> 29:23.098
- What?
- Lilli looks like a cowrie shell there.

29:23.350 --> 29:26.849
So that's what you call mine,
a cowrie shell.

29:27.103 --> 29:31.765
- And we call Richard's a...
- No, no, no! Never mind.

29:31.983 --> 29:37.108
I should have explained certain
of life's facts to you years ago.

29:37.322 --> 29:43.656
- Explain certain of life's facts now.
- No, I need to think about it first.

29:43.870 --> 29:47.618
I'll explain it after your
spelling lesson tonight.

29:47.832 --> 29:50.323
- Let's rinse off.
- Tonight?

29:50.543 --> 29:52.417
All right? Everybody.

29:59.302 --> 30:02.006
Why do people get married?

30:02.221 --> 30:06.088
God commanded that when a man
and woman love each other...

30:06.308 --> 30:09.927
...they take vows.
Vows are like promises.

30:10.145 --> 30:14.309
They make promises to each other
in the eyes of God.

30:14.525 --> 30:17.941
And that's called
the marriage ceremony.

30:18.153 --> 30:21.071
Here's the ceremony
your father used to say...

30:21.281 --> 30:24.946
...when he performed marriages
at the mission.

30:25.786 --> 30:27.862
What about the life facts?

30:36.963 --> 30:41.424
When a girl becomes a woman,
and a boy becomes a man...

30:41.635 --> 30:45.679
- When's that?
- Well, it's different for everyone...

30:45.931 --> 30:49.975
...but you'll know when it happens.
- How?

30:50.352 --> 30:56.224
Lilli, your body will become rounder.
You'll grow breasts like mine.

30:56.441 --> 30:59.358
And you'll bleed a bit
from between your legs.

30:59.569 --> 31:02.274
I don't wanna bleed.

31:02.906 --> 31:04.863
It only lasts a few days.

31:05.116 --> 31:10.193
And it's a great blessing
because it means you can have a baby.

31:11.122 --> 31:17.160
- Do I have to bleed?
- No. But your body will change too.

31:17.378 --> 31:20.996
Your voice gets deeper.
Hair will grow on your face.

31:21.215 --> 31:26.043
You'd look handsome with a beard.
Unless you want to scrape it off.

31:26.262 --> 31:30.840
- I want the baby now.
- You can't. You're not ready yet.

31:31.058 --> 31:34.723
Also, you need the man
to make the baby inside you.

31:34.937 --> 31:37.095
Inside me?

31:37.314 --> 31:40.564
Yes. There's a special place
inside a woman...

31:40.818 --> 31:44.732
...where the baby stays nice
and warm and safe...

31:44.989 --> 31:48.571
...until it's ready
to be born into the world.

31:48.784 --> 31:51.275
How does the baby get in there?

31:52.538 --> 31:54.411
Well...

31:54.623 --> 32:00.044
...after they're married,
the man and woman lie very...

32:00.254 --> 32:05.330
...very close together and... -
- I know. It's like the iguanas, Lilli.

32:05.550 --> 32:10.011
You know, when they get so close
you can't tell them apart.

32:10.222 --> 32:12.298
- That's it.
- That's it?

32:12.724 --> 32:15.891
Yes. Iguanas have
their babies soon after.

32:16.394 --> 32:21.305
- That's it, Mother?
- Well, that's most of it.

32:21.524 --> 32:26.317
That's what I've been waiting
to hear all day?

34:31.902 --> 34:37.193
- That's not gonna help.
- Look what you did to my spear. Go away.

34:37.366 --> 34:40.864
That was my fish.
Go back out where you belong.

34:41.078 --> 34:44.909
Richard, look.
Now what are we gonna do?

34:45.081 --> 34:48.284
What are we gonna do now, Richard?

34:48.668 --> 34:53.663
- What are we gonna do?
- Will you be quiet and let me think?

35:10.273 --> 35:12.562
Lilli!

35:14.444 --> 35:16.935
Richard!

35:25.538 --> 35:28.742
We're out past sunset.
Mother's gonna be angry.

35:32.337 --> 35:35.291
- What are you doing?
- I've got an idea.

36:12.001 --> 36:14.242
He's coming. Come on!

37:02.675 --> 37:07.088
Where have you been?
Do you realize how late it is?

37:07.263 --> 37:13.301
But there was this old shark in the
channel. He took Richard's spear.

37:13.478 --> 37:16.763
I told you to keep away from sharks.

37:17.315 --> 37:20.185
- Boat drifted loose.
- What are the rules?

37:20.359 --> 37:22.767
- Be home by sunset always.
- And?

37:22.945 --> 37:27.903
- Never to the north side of the island.
- Do you see that? A full moon!

37:28.117 --> 37:33.360
We are going straight home and this is
never happening again. Do you hear me?

38:16.206 --> 38:21.829
Oh! Lilli, Richard.
Go get some thatch.

39:01.042 --> 39:03.959
Get back inside.

39:46.086 --> 39:49.585
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

39:49.756 --> 39:54.085
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

39:54.260 --> 39:59.172
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses as we...

39:59.307 --> 40:05.310
...forgive those who trespass against
us. Lead us not into temptation...

40:05.480 --> 40:12.147
...but deliver us from evil. For thine is
the kingdom, power and glory forever.

40:19.952 --> 40:24.116
I can feel that the sickness has moved
into my lungs now.

40:24.290 --> 40:28.240
And that means I might not get well.

40:29.211 --> 40:31.619
What's going to happen?

40:32.631 --> 40:35.917
You may have to be here without me.

40:36.135 --> 40:37.926
If God wants...

40:38.095 --> 40:44.347
...I'll be with your father and we'll
be guardian angels watching over you.

40:46.854 --> 40:49.808
This is my special place.

40:49.982 --> 40:54.359
It's quiet here,
and I can see the house.

40:58.574 --> 41:03.698
Hollow out this ground about so deep.

41:03.870 --> 41:07.738
And line it with thatch and moss.

41:07.916 --> 41:10.834
Then fill it in...

41:11.002 --> 41:14.253
...and smooth it over with earth.

41:16.174 --> 41:19.460
I'll write out a prayer for you to say.

41:19.636 --> 41:23.847
We'll carve a marker and it will say:

41:24.349 --> 41:27.469
"Here lies Sarah Hargraves.

41:27.644 --> 41:33.516
Wife of William, mother of Lillian..."

41:36.611 --> 41:39.731
And I know I'm not your
real mother, Richard.

41:39.948 --> 41:42.901
But I would like to have it said:

41:43.076 --> 41:46.776
"And mother of Richard."

42:09.977 --> 42:14.722
We pray the Lord to grant
this last abiding wish.

42:14.898 --> 42:20.141
That Lilli and Richard love each other,
take care of each other...

42:20.320 --> 42:24.104
...and keep up with their lessons...

42:24.324 --> 42:29.698
...and be prepared for the
ship when it comes. Amen.

44:09.469 --> 44:12.838
- Breakfast looks extra good today.
- Thank you.

44:13.014 --> 44:18.435
- Don't forget, you cook tomorrow.
- You're the one who always forgets.

44:18.603 --> 44:23.942
- What? What do I forget?
- To color your eggs for the hunt.

44:24.150 --> 44:28.230
I didn't forget. I don't think
we should do it this year.

44:28.655 --> 44:30.647
But we do it every Easter.

44:30.824 --> 44:35.651
The calendar marks say tomorrow's
Easter, so we must have the hunt.

44:36.704 --> 44:38.033
Why?

44:38.206 --> 44:41.788
How else do we know who finds
the most eggs and wins?

44:41.918 --> 44:45.453
- Wins what, Richard?
- I don't know.

44:45.630 --> 44:48.880
Nothing. Just wins.

44:49.133 --> 44:54.554
It seems silly to me. I don't
understand why we have to do it.

44:56.182 --> 44:58.637
Because Mother would want us to.

45:06.442 --> 45:12.314
I've got an idea. Whoever finds
the most eggs this year wins a prize.

45:12.489 --> 45:14.197
What kind of a prize?

45:14.366 --> 45:17.486
If you win,
I've gotta give you something.

45:17.661 --> 45:21.077
And if I win,
you've gotta give me something.

45:22.916 --> 45:27.128
It's a wonderful idea.

45:27.337 --> 45:31.169
I hid ten eggs between
the beach and the berry patch.

45:31.341 --> 45:34.128
I hid ten between the rocks
and the fern glade.

45:34.303 --> 45:38.680
- Ready?
- Ready. Get set. Go!

46:22.141 --> 46:25.012
I found nine. Beat that.

46:25.686 --> 46:30.182
- I only found eight.
- The winner's me. Where's my prize?

47:19.739 --> 47:23.073
You were down so long.
What were you doing?

47:23.243 --> 47:24.986
You'll see.

47:50.603 --> 47:52.726
Your prize!

49:03.133 --> 49:05.884
I'm gonna keep this forever.

49:07.887 --> 49:12.798
My prize. The white bead.

49:14.060 --> 49:18.888
I think it looks nice in my hair.

49:19.065 --> 49:20.440
Do you?

49:22.652 --> 49:25.107
I don't care what you do with it...

49:25.279 --> 49:27.984
...or how you wear it.

49:28.157 --> 49:31.573
You can hang it from your nose
for all I care.

50:44.982 --> 50:47.604
Back and forth.

50:47.944 --> 50:52.404
Round and round.
You think this whole reef is yours.

50:52.573 --> 50:56.322
You think you can swallow
anything that swims.

50:56.494 --> 50:59.163
You'd like to catch me, wouldn't you?

50:59.330 --> 51:05.202
But I was too fast, stupid sea slug.
I can beat you every time.

51:05.377 --> 51:10.419
And if you don't believe me,
I'll prove it!

51:37.659 --> 51:41.823
Master of the reef!

51:48.461 --> 51:53.456
The first time, he almost got me.
But I was too fast for him.

51:53.675 --> 51:57.459
This time, he was lying in wait.

51:57.637 --> 52:00.591
So I dive in,
and I can see down his mouth.

52:00.765 --> 52:04.466
There's about 500 teeth.
There's fish around his gills.

52:04.644 --> 52:06.886
And he comes at me.

52:07.730 --> 52:11.313
He misses me. Stupid sea slug!

52:12.026 --> 52:18.610
- It seems silly to me.
- Silly? It's not silly. It's dangerous.

52:18.825 --> 52:24.281
Exactly. That's why it's silly.
I don't understand why you do it.

52:24.455 --> 52:27.290
- I like the way it makes me feel
- What?

52:27.458 --> 52:34.125
Inside here. It feels all alive when
I know I'm the master of the reef.

52:34.340 --> 52:37.673
"The master of the reef.
The master of the reef."

52:37.843 --> 52:41.129
Hey, don't you ever make fun of me.

52:41.680 --> 52:44.088
I'm sorry.

52:46.101 --> 52:51.772
Besides, you're the silly one. Always
touching and looking at yourself.

52:52.900 --> 52:56.019
- I don't touch myself.
- Yes, you do.

52:56.278 --> 53:00.145
You're always touching those
when you look in the mirror.

53:00.324 --> 53:03.159
I'm just measuring
how much they've grown.

53:03.327 --> 53:07.371
- You shouldn't look when I'm naked.
- Why not?

53:07.539 --> 53:10.990
- I always used to see you naked.
- It's different now.

53:11.168 --> 53:13.623
- Why?
- I don't know.

53:13.795 --> 53:16.998
I don't know why it's different,
but it is.

53:17.174 --> 53:18.205
Lilli?

53:26.224 --> 53:29.474
I wish things could be
the way they used to be.

53:29.644 --> 53:32.431
When we had fun.

53:34.190 --> 53:37.144
Remember the seesaw she made us?

53:38.861 --> 53:41.020
The games we used to play?

53:45.243 --> 53:47.994
Ring around the rosy?

54:29.369 --> 54:31.327
Richard?

54:32.831 --> 54:34.824
Yes?

54:36.960 --> 54:43.544
You wouldn't mind if I moved my bed
to another part of the house?

54:46.344 --> 54:48.384
No.

54:49.556 --> 54:52.510
If you weren't gonna do it, I was.

56:50.299 --> 56:52.458
How long have you been there?

56:52.635 --> 56:55.422
I saw the blood on the quilt.

56:57.265 --> 56:59.257
Are you all right?

57:04.522 --> 57:06.680
Do you remember?

57:07.817 --> 57:11.861
What Mother said would happen
when I became a woman?

57:13.030 --> 57:14.145
Yes.

57:15.324 --> 57:17.317
Well...

57:17.534 --> 57:19.860
...I've become one.

57:36.803 --> 57:38.630
Richard, wake up!

57:39.264 --> 57:41.422
Richard?

57:43.101 --> 57:45.723
Richard! Richard, wake up.

57:45.896 --> 57:49.311
I can't sleep with my bed
facing the wrong way.

57:49.482 --> 57:51.890
- Soon as I'm awake.
- You are. Come...

57:52.068 --> 57:55.733
No, I'm not. Stop it.
Let go, I'm not dressed.

57:55.905 --> 57:59.155
Wrap the quilt around you.

58:01.536 --> 58:04.027
Come on!

58:07.709 --> 58:11.956
- What's wrong? You're humped over.
- Just give me a minute.

58:12.130 --> 58:15.997
- What happened to it?
- It gets that way all the time now.

58:16.175 --> 58:18.797
- Well, does it hurt?
- No.

58:19.595 --> 58:21.718
Well, can you walk?

58:21.931 --> 58:26.225
I can walk just fine.
I can make it go away if I want to.

58:26.394 --> 58:28.470
- How?
- None of your business.

58:28.646 --> 58:31.516
If we keep secrets,
nothing will be the...

58:31.691 --> 58:36.815
Nothing's the same around here anyway.
Nothing's the way it used to be!

58:37.154 --> 58:40.440
Come on, let's move your stupid bed.

58:55.130 --> 58:57.039
Mother.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.587
I don't know what to do.

59:01.553 --> 59:05.337
He's changed, I've changed.

59:06.391 --> 59:09.725
Everything's so confusing.

59:11.229 --> 59:16.105
- I'm tired of you snooping. Go!
- I'm sick of you telling me to go away.

59:16.276 --> 59:17.735
Go away! I mean it.

59:17.903 --> 59:21.900
I'll go where I've always wanted to go,
to the north side.

59:22.073 --> 59:24.280
No! We're in a full moon.

59:24.451 --> 59:27.701
- I can do what I want.
- You can't. It's a rule!

59:27.912 --> 59:32.455
It's not my rule! It was her rule!
She wasn't even my real mother!

59:32.667 --> 59:36.001
- She loved you like a real mother.
- I don't care.

59:36.171 --> 59:41.295
I'm sick of the rules. From now on,
I can do whatever I want to do.

59:41.467 --> 59:45.299
I'm old enough. I can go
wherever I wanna go...

59:45.471 --> 59:48.009
...and come home when I want to.

01:04:49.478 --> 01:04:53.262
Richard? Richard?

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.441
What happened? What have you done?

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:59.066
I had to hide.

01:04:59.238 --> 01:05:02.737
These heathens danced around me.
They didn't see me.

01:05:02.908 --> 01:05:05.613
If they had, I would've been dead.

01:05:20.258 --> 01:05:22.547
There was this one heathen...

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.554
...and at first, I wanted to kill him.

01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:30.847
And then, I didn't want to kill him.
And then, I couldn't kill him.

01:05:31.019 --> 01:05:34.388
- Then he saw you. He'll tell the others!
- No.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:38.015
I let him go. Peace.

01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:41.485
I hope you're right.
I'm glad you're okay.

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:47.194
I thought I'd never see you again.
I never want us to fight again, ever.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:49.619
Me neither.

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.910
- Lilli?
- Yes?

01:05:57.169 --> 01:06:01.381
- Friends?
- Oh, yes. Always.

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:38.913
I feel like crying.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.914
So do I.

01:06:44.424 --> 01:06:48.374
- I want us to be husband and wife.
- Yes.

01:06:59.689 --> 01:07:02.145
With this ring...

01:07:02.901 --> 01:07:04.977
...I thee wed.

01:07:07.697 --> 01:07:12.655
With this ring,
I thee wed you, Richard.

01:07:13.786 --> 01:07:15.364
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:22.662
- And now we're...
- One.

01:07:23.713 --> 01:07:25.255
Forever.

01:09:16.365 --> 01:09:17.907
Look.

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:25.037
Lilli, hurry! The signal fire!

01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:54.810
What if they're heathens?
I'm frightened.

01:09:55.612 --> 01:10:00.404
Maybe we shouldn't light the fire.
Let's see who they are first.

01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:33.640
Eight people.

01:10:37.903 --> 01:10:42.067
The one in the light covering
may be a woman.

01:10:42.533 --> 01:10:44.193
Woman?

01:12:10.953 --> 01:12:14.037
Watch them.
They may not be civilized.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:19.117
Civilized.
C-I-V-I-L-I-Z-I-D.

01:12:20.963 --> 01:12:25.292
Remember what Mother said
about a firm handshake.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.386
My name is Richard.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:31.881
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

01:12:32.558 --> 01:12:36.602
I'm Lilli, and I'm ready
to go back to civilization.

01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:39.682
What?

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:43.848
<i>I am Captain Jacob Hilliard,
master of the Tradewind.</i>

01:12:44.903 --> 01:12:47.394
And we...
Is this your land?

01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:50.152
Yes. My house is there.

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.985
We're in need of fresh water.
Our casks are fouled.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:59.832
Will you grant us permission
to come ashore?

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:03.916
Yes. You are welcome here.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.633
Cover yourself,
and I'll get my daughter.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:12.256
- Does that binding choke you?
- No, certainly not.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.217
Well, yes, sometimes.

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:18.387
I'd appreciate it if you'd...

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:28.570
How do you catch fish with that spear?

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:31.270
It's not a spear, mate.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:34.023
- What is it?
- It's a rifle.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:36.819
Blow a man's head right off.

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.446
Castaways! How exciting!

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:43.206
They're an odd mixture of
knowledge and ignorance.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.288
Oh, and their attire
is a little bit...

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:51.384
Well, it's quite sparse.

01:14:05.065 --> 01:14:06.939
Is anything wrong?

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:12.899
The color. It's the same as the sky.

01:14:13.156 --> 01:14:15.065
Pure silk.

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:19.279
With my compliments.

01:14:22.999 --> 01:14:24.577
And for your brother.

01:14:24.834 --> 01:14:28.334
Oh, he's not my brother.
He's my husband.

01:14:28.546 --> 01:14:30.005
Your husband?

01:14:38.014 --> 01:14:40.470
Mother died six years ago.

01:14:41.059 --> 01:14:44.013
- How do you follow the years?
- She taught us.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:47.979
We know that 12 full moons
are one year.

01:14:48.191 --> 01:14:51.642
We have Christmas, Thanksgiving
and Easter.

01:14:51.861 --> 01:14:54.778
We're not sure they're
on the right days.

01:14:55.156 --> 01:14:57.825
It's amazing, the two of you...

01:14:58.075 --> 01:15:01.575
...in this remote, godforsaken place.

01:15:01.996 --> 01:15:04.866
Not godforsaken, Captain Hilliard.

01:15:05.124 --> 01:15:07.163
Not godforsaken at all.

01:15:07.877 --> 01:15:12.953
You do set an excellent table.
My compliments to the chef.

01:15:13.215 --> 01:15:15.920
They've made their own dinnerware.

01:15:16.343 --> 01:15:20.839
Cups, soup spoons. Ingenious.

01:15:25.727 --> 01:15:29.476
- Won't Mr. Quinlan be joining us?
- He's a seafarer...

01:15:29.731 --> 01:15:32.602
...and prefers to be by himself.

01:15:32.859 --> 01:15:35.896
I see why you've been lost
for so long.

01:15:36.154 --> 01:15:41.149
- The charts don't show this island.
- It's a wonder we found you.

01:15:42.619 --> 01:15:46.830
Heathens come to the north side
at certain times.

01:15:47.749 --> 01:15:50.205
There's a burial ground there.

01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:57.421
This is ever so tasty. A great treat
from the slop we eat on the ship.

01:15:57.884 --> 01:15:59.047
What is it?

01:15:59.302 --> 01:16:00.962
Eel broth.

01:16:02.013 --> 01:16:03.673
Eel?

01:16:03.932 --> 01:16:06.257
Well, only the broth is eel.

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:09.851
The little white chunks
are sea urchin.

01:16:10.104 --> 01:16:14.482
We appreciate your hospitality
and hope we can repay you.

01:16:14.734 --> 01:16:16.228
You can.

01:16:16.819 --> 01:16:19.357
You can take us back to civilization.

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:23.113
I should think.
It must be awfully boring here.

01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:27.032
What is the meaning of "boring"?

01:16:27.622 --> 01:16:33.043
Well, boring is when you have
nothing whatever to do.

01:16:33.294 --> 01:16:37.457
So you're bored.
Like you must be here.

01:16:42.136 --> 01:16:45.552
No. We're never bored.

01:16:48.517 --> 01:16:51.352
Boots and a shirt...

01:16:51.854 --> 01:16:54.427
...and a coat and trousers.

01:16:56.733 --> 01:17:00.102
I'll let Sylvia explain
the female garments.

01:17:00.571 --> 01:17:03.275
Well, carry on.

01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:10.657
Buttons!

01:17:12.249 --> 01:17:15.368
I remember buttons on Mother's dress.

01:17:15.585 --> 01:17:17.661
It's Irish lace.

01:17:18.046 --> 01:17:22.957
Richard, turn your head.
I'm showing her a foundation garment.

01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:27.339
Although there isn't much
you haven't seen.

01:17:38.066 --> 01:17:42.644
- What does it do?
- It goes around the waist, like this.

01:17:43.154 --> 01:17:45.645
And then cinch the drawstring.

01:17:47.408 --> 01:17:52.035
Don't look yet, Richard.
I'm showing Lillian my secrets.

01:17:56.918 --> 01:17:58.328
Look.

01:17:59.003 --> 01:18:03.250
This is velvet plush.
And these are silver.

01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:05.795
So smooth.

01:18:13.601 --> 01:18:17.052
Hairbrush and combs. Powder puff.

01:18:18.314 --> 01:18:20.602
Rouge and powder.

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:25.484
Lavender water.

01:18:27.281 --> 01:18:29.439
Musk-rose perfume.

01:18:30.617 --> 01:18:32.409
And a hand mirror.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.041
You're pretty,
except for the hue of your skin.

01:18:40.293 --> 01:18:42.167
But we can fix that.

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:44.835
What's wrong with my skin?

01:18:45.048 --> 01:18:49.046
It's tainted brown.
We'll lighten it with lemon juice.

01:18:49.302 --> 01:18:50.962
Why?

01:18:51.888 --> 01:18:56.930
You don't want people to think
you're a field hand, do you?

01:18:57.811 --> 01:18:59.720
No.

01:19:09.781 --> 01:19:13.446
- Worse than fish fat.
- It's quite costly.

01:19:16.079 --> 01:19:17.870
Well, look at you.

01:19:18.122 --> 01:19:21.906
You do look handsome
in your boulevard suit.

01:19:23.836 --> 01:19:26.161
So handsome.

01:21:25.289 --> 01:21:28.705
Do you think I've applied
too much rouge?

01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:32.246
No. I think it's beautiful.

01:21:33.171 --> 01:21:36.208
Well, thank you, kind sir.

01:21:38.552 --> 01:21:40.129
Well...

01:21:40.887 --> 01:21:43.758
All powder and paint
with nothing to do.

01:21:44.015 --> 01:21:49.721
- We could go outside and count stars.
- Is that what you do here at night?

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.019
Sometimes we count stars.

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.432
Sometimes we sing.

01:21:54.859 --> 01:21:58.026
- Sometimes we mate, sometimes we sleep.
- Mate?!

01:21:58.738 --> 01:22:01.692
- Yes.
- Do you mate often?

01:22:02.075 --> 01:22:04.530
Whenever we want to.

01:22:07.205 --> 01:22:10.621
- Just like that?
- Well, yes. Yes.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.622
Sometimes we dance.
I love to dance.

01:22:14.128 --> 01:22:16.417
Let's show Sylvia how we dance.

01:22:28.059 --> 01:22:29.636
Come on, you try it.

01:22:29.894 --> 01:22:35.232
I don't call that a dance.
It's childish and simple-minded.

01:22:35.858 --> 01:22:39.986
- What do you mean?
- Grown people don't dance like that.

01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:44.948
Maybe we should learn
a grown-up dance.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.404
- I shall teach you.
- Oh, will you?

01:22:49.246 --> 01:22:50.527
It's like this.

01:22:50.789 --> 01:22:53.576
It's naughty.
It's the Spanish polka.

01:22:58.797 --> 01:23:03.708
<i>Spirit's willing, flesh is weak
Kiss me, darling, on the cheek</i>

01:23:07.347 --> 01:23:09.636
Now do it slow.

01:23:12.644 --> 01:23:16.772
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:23:18.441 --> 01:23:21.312
You're a beautiful dancer, Richard.

01:23:24.114 --> 01:23:26.153
She must mind her manners.

01:23:26.366 --> 01:23:29.699
It's not polite to leave a guest
during a lesson.

01:23:29.911 --> 01:23:34.454
Well, we're sorry, but she'll just
have to wait her turn.

01:23:45.802 --> 01:23:48.886
She's gonna teach me how to mazurka.

01:23:49.347 --> 01:23:52.264
As soon as I get it right,
I'll show you.

01:23:52.517 --> 01:23:55.054
You lied to me.

01:23:55.353 --> 01:23:57.559
When did I lie to you?

01:23:58.439 --> 01:24:01.642
You told me once
that you'd never hurt me.

01:24:03.319 --> 01:24:04.979
How did I hurt you?

01:24:05.613 --> 01:24:09.112
When you always stare at her,
it hurts me.

01:24:09.366 --> 01:24:11.110
I'm sorry.

01:24:12.536 --> 01:24:15.573
It's just that she's so different.

01:24:17.333 --> 01:24:18.364
In what way?

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:23.077
Well, just look at her.
The way she's all covered up.

01:24:23.338 --> 01:24:27.288
You said you found her clothes
stupid and unnecessary.

01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:28.714
I do.

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:31.761
It's just...

01:24:32.973 --> 01:24:36.923
I wonder what she looks like
underneath all of them.

01:24:37.144 --> 01:24:41.011
You mean you want to look at her...

01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:43.722
...because you can't see her?

01:24:44.526 --> 01:24:46.068
Yes.

01:24:46.319 --> 01:24:52.571
You remember when I wanted to go to the
north side, just because I couldn't.

01:24:54.744 --> 01:24:56.701
Yes, I do.

01:24:58.998 --> 01:25:02.948
I also remember what almost happened
to you when you did go.

01:25:03.211 --> 01:25:05.417
Good night, Richard.

01:26:08.775 --> 01:26:12.607
- What have you done to yourself?
- Don't you like it?

01:26:13.572 --> 01:26:17.404
No. Wash it off.

01:26:19.744 --> 01:26:23.956
You don't like it on me,
but you love it on Sylvia.

01:26:24.207 --> 01:26:28.952
Please, Lilli, let's not fight.
We promised we'd never fight.

01:26:31.548 --> 01:26:35.047
You never eat breakfast anymore.
Are you sick?

01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:39.215
Richard, I'm ready for my lesson now!

01:26:39.931 --> 01:26:43.051
I promised to teach her how to fish.

01:27:28.353 --> 01:27:30.346
Here we are together.

01:27:30.564 --> 01:27:33.980
Out in the middle of
a beautiful fishpond.

01:27:34.484 --> 01:27:36.940
In plain view of everyone.

01:27:37.195 --> 01:27:39.153
So respectable.

01:27:39.573 --> 01:27:42.776
But look at this, kind sir.

01:27:43.869 --> 01:27:47.617
All we have to do
is lower our heads...

01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:53.582
...and we're completely hidden
from prying eyes.

01:28:08.935 --> 01:28:11.687
So we can do whatever we want.

01:28:48.766 --> 01:28:51.339
- Lovely.
- Get out of here!

01:28:53.687 --> 01:28:55.893
Come on, don't be like that.

01:28:56.148 --> 01:28:59.398
- Richard?
- Richard!

01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:01.104
He'll never hear you.

01:29:01.361 --> 01:29:05.110
He'll be out playing games
with Miss Sylvia for hours.

01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:19.622
- You're missing something. The pearl.
- What do you mean?

01:29:20.005 --> 01:29:23.753
- The little bead in your hair.
- It's at the house.

01:29:26.344 --> 01:29:28.301
Lilli.

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:32.097
It's no time to be thinking
about Lilli.

01:29:32.642 --> 01:29:35.394
I told her I'd never hurt her.

01:29:37.814 --> 01:29:41.646
Don't feel sorry for her.
She's had you all to herself.

01:29:41.901 --> 01:29:45.768
- You're not hers. You're not married.
- We are.

01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:47.061
But not really.

01:29:47.323 --> 01:29:50.609
Made-up words in the middle of a
jungle doesn't count.

01:29:50.868 --> 01:29:52.944
It does to me.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:01.836
Why don't you just follow your heart?

01:30:02.588 --> 01:30:06.372
She is my heart.

01:30:12.598 --> 01:30:13.629
Where is it?

01:30:14.517 --> 01:30:16.972
You can't just leave me here!

01:30:17.353 --> 01:30:22.560
Very rude behavior!
You'll never fit in civilized society!

01:30:23.233 --> 01:30:24.776
Richard?

01:30:45.005 --> 01:30:46.796
Get away from her!

01:31:06.484 --> 01:31:10.019
- Came from the house.
- Get the other rifle.

01:31:33.302 --> 01:31:34.880
No!

01:31:38.182 --> 01:31:39.676
Get him!

01:31:45.898 --> 01:31:47.309
Look out!

01:31:49.193 --> 01:31:50.438
No!

01:32:04.458 --> 01:32:05.537
Help us!

01:32:05.792 --> 01:32:10.039
- Quinlan, hold off! You'll kill him!
- All right, that's enough.

01:32:10.297 --> 01:32:12.586
You heard me. I said, enough.

01:32:13.175 --> 01:32:14.585
Break it up.

01:32:14.801 --> 01:32:15.999
Quinlan!

01:32:16.553 --> 01:32:19.803
- Get off him.
- I'll take his bloody head off!

01:32:20.056 --> 01:32:22.179
- Get off him!
- Put that down.

01:32:23.602 --> 01:32:27.220
- Bugger off!
- Drop it, or you'll answer to mutiny!

01:32:33.778 --> 01:32:36.945
- I said, put it down.
- No, Richard!

01:32:37.198 --> 01:32:39.654
- Quinlan!
- Run!

01:32:41.619 --> 01:32:44.075
Richard!

01:34:50.996 --> 01:34:52.870
Are you all right?

01:34:53.707 --> 01:34:55.534
I'm fine.

01:34:57.169 --> 01:35:00.253
I always weather a storm well.

01:35:01.298 --> 01:35:03.089
I get that from Mother.

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.921
Yes, you do.

01:35:08.722 --> 01:35:12.007
Captain Hilliard wants
to set sail at dawn.

01:35:13.602 --> 01:35:17.813
I guess that means his daughter
wants to set sail at dawn.

01:35:18.064 --> 01:35:23.141
I don't care what she wants.
I don't care about her at all.

01:35:23.737 --> 01:35:26.940
You're the most important thing
in the world.

01:35:29.242 --> 01:35:32.326
Well, you can set sail at dawn...

01:35:34.372 --> 01:35:36.412
...but we're not going.

01:35:37.292 --> 01:35:39.083
You're not making sense.

01:35:41.254 --> 01:35:43.293
Do you remember...

01:35:44.048 --> 01:35:47.382
...that lullaby she used to sing to us?

01:35:57.103 --> 01:35:58.597
Yes.

01:36:00.856 --> 01:36:03.857
Will you teach me to play it on this?

01:36:08.864 --> 01:36:10.275
Why?

01:36:11.158 --> 01:36:14.361
I'm going to have use for it.

01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:19.913
There's a baby growing inside of me.

01:36:21.335 --> 01:36:23.162
How do you know?

01:36:24.588 --> 01:36:28.882
A woman knows these
kind of things, that's how.

01:36:29.134 --> 01:36:30.628
Lilli!

01:36:34.806 --> 01:36:38.851
But I won't let it
be born in civilization.

01:36:39.019 --> 01:36:41.344
I want it to be born right here.

01:36:41.521 --> 01:36:46.267
Where there's no evil,
and no lies, and no guns.

01:36:48.778 --> 01:36:50.438
You're right.

01:36:53.116 --> 01:36:54.990
We'll stay here.

01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:57.949
Just the three of us.

01:36:58.830 --> 01:37:00.870
I love you, Lilli.
