14:36.320 --> 14:38.200
New job.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.960
[Muffled game sound effects]

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
Does Rex know Eddie's here?

14:49.560 --> 14:51.600
And Sarah wants to
keep it that way.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.880
He broke the terms
of their agreement.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.400
"My Ex-Wife's A Bitch"?

14:55.440 --> 14:57.120
He didn't think
of mentioning it?

14:57.160 --> 14:59.760
She's his comedy agent.
She knows how this works.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.240
Yeah, well, hell hath no fury
like an agent scorned.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.280
What's Davey McKenzie
doing downstairs?

15:06.160 --> 15:07.640
Nice shirt.

15:12.200 --> 15:16.880
Mr. Pope, your ex-wife
is experiencing...

15:16.920 --> 15:19.400
considerable distress
seeing her life--

15:19.440 --> 15:20.680
- Former life.
- ..with you,

15:20.720 --> 15:22.640
continually sourced
as material.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.400
Well, it's pretty distressing--

15:24.440 --> 15:26.760
For my client
not to be able to see his son.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.480
It's been three weeks
since he's had Eddie.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.720
You can't use the gags
about my mother's cancer.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.840
Not even the chemo party bit?

15:35.080 --> 15:37.200
See what I've
got to work with here?

15:37.240 --> 15:39.920
Have you got nothing happy
to write about?

15:39.960 --> 15:42.400
You used to find this funny.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.480
You used to say there was
nothing was so bad

15:44.520 --> 15:46.240
you couldn't
take the piss out of it.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.680
How else do I shine this shit?

15:50.560 --> 15:54.320
- When you loved me--
- Yeah, when I loved you.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.960
But then you used to be
funnier than this.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.040
All we would ask
is that you find

15:59.080 --> 16:02.400
an alternative source
for your comedy.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.880
Otherwise the current situation

16:03.920 --> 16:05.960
with regard to spending time
with your son

16:06.000 --> 16:07.440
- may be made permanent.
- No.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.080
No, no. No, no, no.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.360
Our concern is that
the continued separation

16:11.400 --> 16:12.880
between my client and his son

16:12.920 --> 16:15.480
compounds a growing
parental alienation.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.320
- I love my son.
- You think this is loving him?

16:18.360 --> 16:20.640
Sorry. I need a break.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.360
- You off, then?
- You need to stay calm.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.320
Do not do this. Do not
make threats with visitation.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.840
- Do not screw with us.
- It's not a threat.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.320
We negotiated a settlement.
We'd nearly agreed--

16:36.360 --> 16:38.320
And how do you think Rex
is gonna pay for it?

16:38.360 --> 16:40.360
This tour. He needs this tour.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.560
I'm concerned about him.
He's on the edge. He really is.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.120
No-one is disputing
your client's right to tour.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.560
Just his right to what's in it.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.000
This is not fair on the kid.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.880
When has divorce
ever been fair on the kids?

16:53.920 --> 16:56.240
- You're coming tonight?
- Yeah, of course.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.520
- Rosie called?
- And texted.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.240
Several times.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.760
I could have brought stuff.
I always bring stuff.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.400
Yeah, well, this time,
we did it.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.880
- You get to give the speech.
- Great. Lucked out there!

17:07.920 --> 17:10.160
I'm tasked with balloons.
Shiny.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.040
It's a surprise party.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.800
She knows. You know she knows.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.000
No. She just hates birthdays.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.800
Exactly. So a surprise party,
it's insane.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.360
Hey.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.640
Christie Carmichael! [Laughs]

17:23.680 --> 17:26.080
I last saw you the night
before Hannah's wedding,

17:26.120 --> 17:30.000
in our back garden...
dancing so badly to Wonderwall.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.160
Oh, please.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.600
Hannah never approved
of the illicit rave.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.960
That is ridiculous.
That is totally ridiculous

17:36.000 --> 17:37.680
cos I raved. We raved.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.920
You never raved.
You took her in.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.440
Your loss is our gain.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.640
- You got grey.
- Mm.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.840
I like it.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.440
The Dolan papers?
Did you sign?

17:45.480 --> 17:47.600
I... I left them on your desk.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.120
I need them...signed
and picked up in the next hour.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.320
Right. Hannah. Nina.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.040
Phwoar. He got better with age.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.120
- Oh, please.
- Seriously.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.720
- Is he um...
- Divorced.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.160
Yeah, sorry. I know
you prefer them attached.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.400
[Game sound effects]

18:17.880 --> 18:20.560
Hey...little man.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.720
We need to find
a compromise here.

18:28.760 --> 18:32.160
Mm. Cutting,
"My ex-wife swore a lot.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.040
Sometimes I'd get offended just
by what came out of her mouth.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.920
For example, my best friend's
cock." That might be a start.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.160
[She sighs]

18:43.280 --> 18:45.080
[Mouths]

18:45.120 --> 18:47.760
It's always better for
the child to see their dad.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.880
Not always. Dad left us
when you were seven.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.120
- Eight. I was eight.
- We did--

18:52.160 --> 18:53.960
If he is fundamentally
a good father--

18:54.000 --> 18:56.320
- We did--
- It is better for the child--

18:56.360 --> 18:58.480
We did fine!

19:00.160 --> 19:03.000
[She sighs]
You start with the tweets.

19:03.040 --> 19:08.080
Cut the tweets and we might...
get him his Wednesdays back.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.920
[Phone ringing]

19:55.880 --> 19:57.840
My client will desist
with tweets

19:57.880 --> 20:01.400
but he asks in return you
consider giving back weekends.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.880
On the proviso
that any material

20:05.920 --> 20:07.800
that also relates
directly to my client

20:07.840 --> 20:09.520
or the marital breakdown
is removed

20:09.560 --> 20:11.800
from any live tours
or broadcasts.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.080
A transcript of the modified
material would be provided.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.800
[Nina] Fine.
- It would be

20:17.840 --> 20:19.680
subject to approval, of course.

20:19.720 --> 20:24.600
So, let's...regroup after lunch
and review.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.520
The stuff about
when he was a baby.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.800
When Eddie was a baby
and that time...

20:32.840 --> 20:36.640
when we were at your mother's
and I started to leak.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.200
You can keep that stuff.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.800
You think?

20:39.840 --> 20:42.080
I snorted out my tea
when I read that bit.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.320
[Phone buzzes and chimes]

20:46.320 --> 20:48.840
Hey. How are you?

20:51.240 --> 20:53.560
[Sarah] Yeah. All good. Good.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.480
[Door closes]

20:55.520 --> 20:57.440
The new man.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.680
Support on my last tour.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.720
That makes me the warm-up act.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.240
- [Door opens]
- Do you need me to get lunch?

21:06.280 --> 21:08.800
- I think we're fine.
- Not even for Eddie?

21:10.160 --> 21:12.160
He's here?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.280
- Eddie?
- Sarah was forced

21:16.320 --> 21:18.640
- to bring him with her today.
- Eddie, it's Dad.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.120
It will not help your case--
Take Sarah to my office.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.280
Eddie?

21:22.320 --> 21:24.240
Rex, please,
this isn't helping anyone.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.880
- Eddie!
- Stop him.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.480
- You stop him!
- Eddie?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.440
Call Security.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.480
- Mr. Pope!
[Rex] I'm sorry if I upset you.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.080
It... Oh! I
just want to see him.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.000
- Right, that's enough.
- Okay. Okay, okay. Alright.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.040
Hey.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.320
- Hey. Alright?
- Eddie.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.480
It's fine. It's okay.
It's okay, buddy.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.560
It's alright. Daddy's just...

21:54.480 --> 21:56.480
I'm sorry, mate.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.680
- Is he...?
- In the boardroom.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.560
I calmed him down.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.720
He's not moving
until he gets to talk to Eddie.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.760
- He doesn't want lunch.
- Fine.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.240
Nil by mouth.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.080
Smoke him out.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.240
[Sighs] I don't want to fight.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.800
No. You just don't want to
fight unless it's with a smile.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.680
I'm late.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.280
- See you. Back at three.
- What is bugging you today?

22:37.320 --> 22:39.640
He's back. Dad.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.520
I saw him.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.160
This morning.
Down in the square.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.200
You recognized him?

22:54.600 --> 22:56.600
I wouldn't.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.440
Of course. You haven't seen him
since you were seven.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.760
Oh, eight the last time.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
[They laugh]

23:08.800 --> 23:10.760
[Sighs]

23:10.800 --> 23:13.160
Did you speak to him?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.000
And say what?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.640
"Where have you been
for the last 30 years?"

23:19.880 --> 23:22.600
- Does he want to see us?
- I don't know.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.480
[Sighs]

23:26.520 --> 23:28.080
I have to go.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.560
Hannah... How did he look?

23:34.640 --> 23:36.120
Old.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.360
[Zander] Okay, as you all know,

23:45.400 --> 23:48.040
we have been getting
a lot of interest from Chicago.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.880
Obviously,
we're excited about expanding.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.000
Excuse me interrupting, but...

23:52.040 --> 23:55.160
- Nathan Stern.
- Christie Carmichael.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.640
Hong Kong
clearly agreed with you.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.120
Oh, you've been
keeping track of me.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.320
- You look well.
- You owe me a fiver.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.360
I kept my hair.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.840
- Ah.
- [Polite laughter]

24:07.840 --> 24:10.360
Zander, Nathan Stern.
Zander Hale.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.920
- You represented Nichols.
- Yeah. A challenging case.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.960
- And won.
- Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.960
Nathan has been instrumental
in changes to the law

24:18.000 --> 24:19.800
involving foreign surrogates.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.200
I keep track of you too.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.720
Right. Well, I couldn't pass by
without kissing my wife.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.360
Your mother, one o'clock.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.560
Still spinning your exit
like a rabid hamster.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.000
Enjoy your lunch.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.520
[Phone ringing]

24:46.480 --> 24:47.960
[Davey] Hello?

24:52.440 --> 24:53.600
Um...

24:55.320 --> 24:58.320
Would you...excuse me...
a moment?

25:10.440 --> 25:12.600
[Indistinct speech]

25:17.040 --> 25:18.560
Davey McKenzie?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.080
Apparently, he's unhappy
with his solicitor.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.920
Fortuitous
that we put in a call.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.040
Oh...

25:24.080 --> 25:25.880
First rule: All bets are off

25:25.920 --> 25:28.040
until the letter of engagement
is signed.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.000
That's invaluable advice.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.760
- Are you coming tonight?
- So you do know?

25:33.800 --> 25:37.080
I said you'd know.
You always know everything.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.360
At least look surprised.
If only for Rose's sake.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.160
No speeches, by the way.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.960
Ha.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.240
Er...that's... That's not good.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.000
We had a window of opportunity
and it has been firmly closed.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.520
- Yeah, I'll sort it--
- We've lost him.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.960
There's nothing to sort.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.600
Learn from this.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.520
It won't happen again.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.080
- No-one died.
- [She exhales]

26:11.120 --> 26:12.840
Not yet.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.120
[Woman laughing]

26:17.240 --> 26:19.200
You are so late.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.280
And you are a part-time nanny.
My work here is done.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.160
Ow!

26:24.200 --> 26:26.440
I've left Hannah
like five messages.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.720
- She's had a new haircut.
- You've seen her?

26:28.760 --> 26:31.800
Working on a case.
Communicating by semaphore.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.320
The Shining Christmas
you didn't speak 'til--

26:35.360 --> 26:36.680
May.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.280
Is that when you were
with Psycho John?

26:38.320 --> 26:40.600
- Do you ever think of Dad?
- No.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.680
He walked out when I was two.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.280
After I was left
by the monkeys.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.240
That's a myth
of your own making.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.880
It's what you and Hannah said.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.960
God, I hate you two.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.640
You say things, then you say
you never said them.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.000
Keep stuff from me.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.120
Because you are
young and impressionable.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.560
I'm getting married
in two months.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.960
Exactly. How is the mouth
breather, by the way?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.960
