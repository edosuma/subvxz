Come on, Deke, come on!

03:27.747 --> 03:28.748
Aah!

03:57.277 --> 03:59.279
I thought we told you

03:59.314 --> 04:01.281
to stop working our
precinct, Early Riser.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.283
We got bigger fish to fry.

04:03.318 --> 04:05.785
You do your trickin'
somewhere else.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.294
Is that my-

04:17.332 --> 04:20.300
Deke!
Deke!

04:38.818 --> 04:40.820
Is everybody here
having a good time?

04:43.323 --> 04:44.603
How about that weather up there?

04:44.824 --> 04:45.864
Is it fine enough for you?

04:47.827 --> 04:49.829
How about me?
How about Deke, your man?

04:51.831 --> 04:52.832
How about me?

04:53.333 --> 04:55.335
How about me?

04:55.835 --> 04:56.836
How about me?

04:56.871 --> 04:58.838
Yeah!
Yeah!

04:58.873 --> 05:00.840
Am I big enough for you?

05:15.855 --> 05:18.358
18 months ago...

05:18.393 --> 05:20.433
I was down on my knees in
the white man's jailhouse.

05:20.860 --> 05:21.861
Mmm!
Yes!

05:21.896 --> 05:25.365
I wasn't down on my knees
in the jailhouse to pray.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
No!
No!

05:26.866 --> 05:29.369
I wasn't even down on
my knees to shoot craps.

05:29.404 --> 05:30.870
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

05:30.905 --> 05:32.872
Deke O'Malley
was down on his knees

05:33.373 --> 05:34.874
in the white man's jail

05:35.375 --> 05:36.376
cleaning out the
white man's toilet bowl!

05:36.411 --> 05:37.411
No!
No!

05:37.877 --> 05:39.379
All right!

05:39.414 --> 05:42.882
So l-i asked the Lord
to help me!

05:42.917 --> 05:44.884
To show me the way!

05:44.919 --> 05:46.886
And bless my soul, he did!

05:46.921 --> 05:47.921
Yeah!
He did!

05:47.922 --> 05:50.390
The Lord come to me in a dream!

05:50.425 --> 05:53.893
He said,
"Deke, I want to use you

05:53.928 --> 05:56.396
like I used Noah of old!"

05:56.896 --> 06:01.401
He said, "Deke, I want you
to build an ark

06:01.436 --> 06:02.902
and sail my people home!"

06:03.403 --> 06:04.404
Yeah!
Yeah!

06:04.439 --> 06:06.906
And there she is, Black Beauty!

06:08.408 --> 06:09.909
Are you black enough to hear me?

06:12.412 --> 06:13.913
Amen! Amen!

06:13.948 --> 06:15.915
For 3 months now,

06:15.950 --> 06:18.918
in Detroit, Chicago,
Los Angeles,

06:18.953 --> 06:20.420
Baltimore, Washington,

06:20.455 --> 06:22.422
people have been
standing in line,

06:22.457 --> 06:23.923
waitin' and waitin'

06:23.958 --> 06:27.427
for a chance to get
on board black beauty.

06:27.462 --> 06:30.430
'Cause, Brothers,
we are going home.

06:31.931 --> 06:34.434
Good-bye, rats and roaches!

06:34.934 --> 06:37.937
Good-bye being
kicked and low-rated!

06:37.972 --> 06:40.940
Good-bye getting
robbed and cheated!

06:40.975 --> 06:44.444
Good-bye having to live
on the white man's welfare!

06:44.479 --> 06:45.479
Right on, Brother!

06:45.945 --> 06:47.947
We are going home.

07:01.961 --> 07:04.964
Come on! Next!
What's your name, Miss?

07:04.999 --> 07:06.966
You'll find salvation.

07:07.001 --> 07:09.969
How the hell did he
get a permit for this?

07:10.004 --> 07:11.971
Lieutenant says
it's a race leap.

07:12.472 --> 07:14.474
It's doing good for his people.

07:14.509 --> 07:16.476
Thank you, Reverend O'Malley,
thank you.

07:16.511 --> 07:18.478
We're going home

07:18.513 --> 07:21.981
all going home

07:22.016 --> 07:23.983
we're going home

07:29.489 --> 07:31.991
we're going home

07:32.026 --> 07:35.495
going home

07:35.530 --> 07:39.499
we're going home

07:39.534 --> 07:43.002
there you go.
Thank you.

07:43.037 --> 07:46.506
But, sir, the minimum
down payment is $100.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.508
Oh, please, ma'am.

07:49.008 --> 07:51.511
You don't want to break ol'
Uncle Budd's heart, do ya?

07:52.011 --> 07:56.516
$20. count it. It's all I
got in the world right now,

07:56.551 --> 07:59.018
but give me a chance.
Please, ma'am.

07:59.053 --> 08:01.020
Why not?

08:01.055 --> 08:03.022
Yeah, sure.

08:03.057 --> 08:04.057
Uncle Budd?

08:04.058 --> 08:07.527
Uncle Budd.
Yeah, Uncle Budd.

08:07.562 --> 08:08.562
There you go.

08:08.563 --> 08:10.029
Okay, step right up!

08:10.064 --> 08:12.532
God bless you, Brother.
God bless you, Brother.

08:21.541 --> 08:25.545
Well, if it ain't king
Kong and Frankenstein.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.548
Hey, ed, I didn't know these
cats was going back to Africa.

08:28.583 --> 08:31.583
They ain't. They're going right back
across the street where they come from.

08:31.586 --> 08:35.054
Only thing I hate worse
than a honky pig cop,

08:35.089 --> 08:37.056
and that's a nigger pig cop.

08:37.091 --> 08:39.558
What kind of talk
is that, soul Brother?

08:40.058 --> 08:43.062
Don't you know that
black is beautiful?

08:51.571 --> 08:53.072
Fly, baby.

08:53.107 --> 08:55.074
Just cool it.

09:02.582 --> 09:04.083
O'Malley?
Yes.

09:04.118 --> 09:06.586
We're from the D.A.'s
office. He wants to see you.

09:06.621 --> 09:08.588
D.A.'s office?
Well, I'm busy.

09:10.089 --> 09:11.089
Now! Let's go!

09:11.090 --> 09:12.091
Wait a minute, buddy!

09:12.126 --> 09:13.092
Let's see your credentials.

09:13.127 --> 09:15.094
Quit stalling, O'Malley.

09:15.129 --> 09:16.129
Black Judas!

09:16.130 --> 09:18.598
That's what you are!

09:19.098 --> 09:20.099
Honky!

09:20.134 --> 09:25.104
Now, now. I'm going
downtown right now

09:25.139 --> 09:27.607
and tell that white man's
district attorney

09:27.642 --> 09:30.610
that Deke O'Malley's gettin' sick
and tired of being pushed around.

09:32.146 --> 09:34.614
Keep it black till I get back.

09:34.649 --> 09:36.115
Ok, let's go.

09:50.129 --> 09:52.131
John! John!

09:52.166 --> 09:54.133
John!

10:15.154 --> 10:16.155
Get in!

10:33.673 --> 10:35.675
Don't you step on my ribs!

13:54.373 --> 13:56.876
Whoo! Hey, Sister,
come here!

14:58.472 --> 15:00.439
No, no, no, no!

15:59.498 --> 16:01.500
Ok, what do you want?

16:01.535 --> 16:03.502
Deke O'Malley.

16:03.537 --> 16:05.504
Yeah? And what's that
got to do with me?

16:05.539 --> 16:08.507
We ain't got O'Malley.
We sure as hell got you.

16:08.542 --> 16:12.011
Which means that sooner
or later, we got O'Malley.

16:12.046 --> 16:14.013
Is that black enough for ya?

16:14.048 --> 16:15.514
What do we got here?

16:18.552 --> 16:21.520
We know how finicky the good
Reverend is about his wardrobe,

16:21.555 --> 16:25.024
so he oughta be scootin' up
here any minute to change.

16:25.059 --> 16:28.527
Hey, ed, dig these fine vines.

16:28.562 --> 16:32.531
Mmm! And on your po' policeman's
salary, you can't afford it.

16:32.566 --> 16:33.566
Ain't that awful?

16:33.567 --> 16:35.534
What a shame. Not a single one your size.

16:35.569 --> 16:38.537
Now, wait a minute. I think this
Italian suit here'll work for me.

16:39.038 --> 16:40.039
Thing of beauty.

16:40.074 --> 16:41.540
What's this here?

16:43.042 --> 16:45.044
Bless Jesus.

16:45.079 --> 16:49.548
A silk hat for occasions.
My, my.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.551
What sacrifices he makes
for his po' starvin' people.

16:53.052 --> 16:55.054
He sure do.

16:58.057 --> 17:00.059
Now, somebody shot up
O'Malley's barbecue

17:00.559 --> 17:04.063
and made off with 87 grand
of poor people's money.

17:05.564 --> 17:08.067
Who?

17:08.102 --> 17:11.069
The question is... who?

17:11.105 --> 17:13.571
Whoever it was just Missed.

17:13.607 --> 17:17.076
Another couple of inches, and we would've
brought you his brains in a saucer.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.078
Oh, yeah? Who did it?

17:19.113 --> 17:20.579
I just asked you that.

17:20.614 --> 17:23.582
O'Malley ratted on the mafia.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.084
Remember?

17:25.118 --> 17:26.118
Could've been them.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.087
Them boys don't never forget.

17:28.587 --> 17:31.090
Could be his number's up,

17:31.125 --> 17:33.092
unless Digger and me
get to him first.

17:33.127 --> 17:34.127
Where is he?

17:38.597 --> 17:40.599
Well, how about it?

17:42.101 --> 17:45.604
Hidin' out,
he ain't got a chance, Iris.

17:45.639 --> 17:49.108
Deke O'Malley
always has a chance.

17:52.146 --> 17:54.113
Hello, betty?
Give me that!

17:54.148 --> 17:56.615
All right, O'Malley, do
yourself a favour and come in-

17:56.650 --> 17:58.617
you bitch!

18:02.121 --> 18:05.124
God damn it, ed, cool it!

18:05.159 --> 18:07.626
He's crazy.

18:07.661 --> 18:11.130
He's crazy. That son of a bitch
is crazy! I want him out!

18:11.165 --> 18:13.132
I got him, Iris.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.134
2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months.

18:15.634 --> 18:17.636
It's all the same.

18:17.671 --> 18:20.139
I'm nailing his ass to the wall.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.641
Be smart, Iris.

18:22.676 --> 18:26.145
Get off the boat
before we sink it.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.657
Ed. Digger.

18:40.659 --> 18:42.661
Something new on the O'Malley squeal. What?

18:42.696 --> 18:45.664
They found the meat truck and the
golden money wagon all smashed up.

18:46.165 --> 18:47.666
One got killed.
O'Malley?

18:47.701 --> 18:49.168
No.

18:49.203 --> 18:50.169
Lieutenant wants you two
guys up there right away.

18:50.204 --> 18:52.171
Where?
Harlem river yard.

18:52.206 --> 18:54.173
Oh, by the way, what's with her? She talk?

18:54.208 --> 18:57.676
No, but she's our main lead
to O'Malley, so watch her.

18:58.177 --> 18:59.678
Be cool, Brother.

18:59.713 --> 19:01.180
Jarema is hep.

19:01.215 --> 19:04.183
She's a stone fox.
Watch your ass.

19:04.218 --> 19:05.218
No sweat there.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.703
Found some confetti.

19:25.704 --> 19:27.206
Where's the loot?

19:27.706 --> 19:28.707
Ask O'Malley.

19:28.742 --> 19:31.710
I know how you feel about O'Malley. Do you?

19:35.714 --> 19:37.216
You make him?

19:37.251 --> 19:40.719
Yeah. He's a pickpocket
named Early Riser.

19:40.754 --> 19:42.221
He was at the rally.

19:42.256 --> 19:45.724
He works with a partner
named lo boy, a junkie.

19:46.725 --> 19:48.727
They worked the holy dream.

19:48.762 --> 19:51.230
Could be the militants, ed.
They hate O'Malley's guts.

19:51.265 --> 19:55.734
No. They wouldn't
pull a job like this.

19:55.769 --> 19:57.736
It ain't their style.

19:57.771 --> 19:58.771
Hey, ed!

19:58.772 --> 19:59.772
What is it?

19:59.773 --> 20:01.740
Look at this.

20:06.245 --> 20:09.748
Cotton from inside
the meat truck.

20:09.783 --> 20:12.751
It ain't drugstore cotton.

20:12.786 --> 20:14.253
What is it?

20:14.753 --> 20:17.256
It's raw, unprocessed cotton,

20:17.291 --> 20:19.758
like from a bale.

20:19.793 --> 20:25.764
Ah. It's a long time
since I seen cotton like that.

20:25.799 --> 20:28.267
Digger, you ain't never
seen no raw cotton before.

20:28.302 --> 20:31.770
You was born and raised right
here in New York, just like me.

20:31.805 --> 20:33.272
What the hell
are you two doing here?

20:34.773 --> 20:37.276
Digger found a hidden drop slot.

20:37.311 --> 20:40.279
This was in it.
It's full of trash.

20:40.779 --> 20:42.781
The syndicate.

20:42.816 --> 20:45.284
When O'Malley was with 'em, he
talked, and they threatened to get him.

20:45.319 --> 20:46.785
Why'd they wait?

20:47.286 --> 20:48.787
White guns comin' up here,

20:48.822 --> 20:50.789
trying to knock off
Reverend O'Malley, you think?

20:50.824 --> 20:52.291
Could be.

20:52.326 --> 20:56.295
Blacks find out about this,
there'll be hell to pay.

20:56.330 --> 20:59.298
I want round the clock police
protection for Reverend O'Malley.

20:59.798 --> 21:01.800
To hell with O'Malley!

21:01.835 --> 21:04.803
What about the $87,000
of poor black folks' money

21:04.838 --> 21:07.306
that he stole from all
over this country? Stole?

21:07.341 --> 21:08.807
That's right. Stole!

21:08.842 --> 21:10.809
We ran a check on
O'Malley's entire operation.

21:10.844 --> 21:12.811
It's clean.
Absolutely legitimate.

21:12.846 --> 21:15.314
Full clearance from
the state department,

21:15.349 --> 21:17.316
securities exchange comMission,

21:17.351 --> 21:18.817
the attorney general of the state
of New York. What else do you want?

21:18.852 --> 21:21.820
What the hell does the attorney
general, the state department,

21:21.855 --> 21:23.322
or even the president
of the united states know

21:23.357 --> 21:25.717
about one Goddamned thing that's
going on up here in Harlem?

21:25.824 --> 21:28.327
Ed O'Malley's respected by
responsible people. Respect, my ass!

21:28.362 --> 21:30.829
Pastors, race leaders,
politicians,

21:30.864 --> 21:33.332
not to mention the large following
he has among black folk everywhere.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.834
Black folk need hope
like everybody else.

21:35.869 --> 21:38.837
What is it with you people?

21:39.338 --> 21:42.341
One of you like Reverend
O'Malley tries to do something,

21:42.376 --> 21:44.343
does anybody try to help him? Hell no!

21:44.378 --> 21:46.345
You're after him
like crabs in a basket.

21:46.845 --> 21:53.352
Uh, how many shares of the back to
Africa, inc. Would you buy, captain?

21:53.387 --> 21:54.387
That's impertinent.

21:54.388 --> 21:56.355
The hell it is!

21:56.390 --> 21:58.357
One more word out of you, and
I'll run you right off the lot.

21:58.392 --> 22:00.859
We've been trying to teach
white folks all our lives.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.361
School's over.

22:02.396 --> 22:06.865
Let's go look for lo boy
at junkies' paradise.

22:11.370 --> 22:13.372
Damn it, Anderson. Who's in
charge of this investigation,

22:13.407 --> 22:14.407
you or them?

22:14.873 --> 22:15.874
You've gotta understand
ed and Digger, sir.

22:16.375 --> 22:18.377
I understand those two,
all right.

22:18.412 --> 22:21.380
Too quick with their fists,

22:21.415 --> 22:23.882
too flip with their talk,
too fast with their guns.

22:23.917 --> 22:26.885
They're two damn black maniacs
on a powder keg,

22:26.920 --> 22:28.887
and you're
letting them run wild.

22:28.922 --> 22:32.891
Ed and Digger, they have their own
special way of dealing with things up here.

22:32.926 --> 22:35.394
And if they find something
kinky on Reverend O'Malley,

22:35.429 --> 22:36.895
I've gotta respect it.

22:45.871 --> 22:47.873
Sister!
Yes?

22:48.373 --> 22:50.375
Good afternoon, Sister.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.879
And what kind of trick are you trying
to play on me, you Old Uncle tom?

22:53.914 --> 22:55.881
Ain't no trick, ma'am.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.884
I'm just trying to get this
bale of cotton onto my cart.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.385
Cotton?
Yes, ma'am.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.388
And I was just wonderin'
if some good, nice-lookin',

23:03.423 --> 23:07.392
strong Christian lady like
you wouldn't give me a hand.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.894
I am a Christian.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.897
That's why I don't take a
stick and knock your teeth out.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.899
All of you trying
to steal my money!

23:14.399 --> 23:15.901
Tryin' to steal your money?

23:15.936 --> 23:18.403
Yes! Trickers! That's what
you are. Every one of you!

23:18.438 --> 23:19.905
Why, you old fool!

23:19.940 --> 23:22.407
Don't you think
I got sense enough to know

23:22.442 --> 23:26.411
there ain't no such thing as
a bale of cotton in Harlem?

23:26.446 --> 23:28.413
Hmmph!

24:20.081 --> 24:23.084
That damn Bryce
chewin' my ass out.

24:23.119 --> 24:25.086
Dumb Anderson didn't say a word.

24:25.587 --> 24:28.089
Well, he's got his own
mortgage to worry about.

24:30.592 --> 24:33.094
I oughta quit this job.

24:33.129 --> 24:35.096
All right, now,
suppose you do quit.

24:35.131 --> 24:37.599
Suppose you tell 'em to
take the badge and shove it.

24:37.634 --> 24:38.600
Who's gonna pay your mortgage?

24:38.635 --> 24:40.101
You.
Mm-mm!

24:40.136 --> 24:43.104
Not me, baby.
You quit, I quit.

24:43.139 --> 24:45.607
Then who'll protect the black
folks from the white folks?

24:47.609 --> 24:51.112
Who's gonna protect the
black folks from themselves?

24:53.114 --> 24:59.120
I'm sick of this. Gotta be at
death's door. I'm tired of this jazz.

25:03.124 --> 25:04.125
God damn.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.627
Aah!

25:05.662 --> 25:07.128
When did you turn Japanese?

25:07.163 --> 25:09.631
Come on.
You know the position.

25:10.131 --> 25:11.371
Come on, spread your legs back.

25:11.633 --> 25:13.134
Finally got it together.

25:13.169 --> 25:14.636
We plan to keep it that way.

25:14.671 --> 25:17.639
This ain't no shooting gallery
no more. This is Swahili class.

25:17.674 --> 25:19.674
So why don't you guys
take your business and split?

25:19.676 --> 25:21.643
Io boy.

25:23.645 --> 25:27.148
Early Riser's partner.
We want him.

25:27.183 --> 25:30.652
Is he on Swahili, too?

25:30.687 --> 25:33.655
If that's who you want,
why don't you check Reba's?

25:43.199 --> 25:45.667
Where'd you learn them
dirty Swahili words?

25:46.167 --> 25:48.670
Ask your mama.

25:58.179 --> 26:00.682
How long you gonna
keep this up, Copper?

26:00.717 --> 26:02.684
Till it's over, Sister.

26:05.186 --> 26:08.690
It's been 4 hours now, and I'm
just sick of lookin' at you.

26:08.725 --> 26:11.693
You are really one ugly child.

26:11.728 --> 26:13.194
I mean, it's really too bad

26:13.695 --> 26:16.698
'cause, um...

26:16.733 --> 26:19.200
if you wasn't, we could, uh,

26:19.235 --> 26:22.704
spend the time, you
know, uh, doin' the thing.

26:22.739 --> 26:25.707
I'll put a sack over my head.

26:29.711 --> 26:30.712
All right.

26:30.747 --> 26:32.213
Knock it off, will ya?

26:52.233 --> 26:55.737
I just wanted to see
if it was gonna fit.

26:55.772 --> 26:58.239
Buck off.

27:06.247 --> 27:07.749
Drop them scissors.

27:08.249 --> 27:10.251
Well, you gotta
breathe, don't you?

27:13.254 --> 27:16.758
Drop 'em or I'll break your arm.

27:21.262 --> 27:23.765
You're not a fag, are you?

27:24.265 --> 27:28.269
Oh, wow. A fag cop.
Ha ha!

27:29.771 --> 27:32.273
It's all poor John
ever spoke of-

27:32.308 --> 27:35.276
that ship and you,
Reverend O'Malley.

27:35.311 --> 27:37.278
And thank you for the flowers.

27:37.313 --> 27:40.782
It's the least I can do under
the circumstances, Mrs. Hill.

27:40.817 --> 27:43.284
He was my right hand.

27:43.785 --> 27:48.790
And I cannot find the words to
express the infinite sorrow I feel

27:48.825 --> 27:52.293
that this unfortunate accident
has taken your husband.

27:52.794 --> 27:55.797
Thank you, Reverend
O'Malley. You are so kind.

28:03.805 --> 28:06.808
May I be of any assistance
to you, Mrs. Hill?

28:08.309 --> 28:11.312
The funeral?

28:11.347 --> 28:13.314
The arrangements?

28:13.349 --> 28:16.818
I just want you
to preach his funeral.

28:16.853 --> 28:20.822
Of course, Mrs. Hill.

28:20.857 --> 28:23.825
And if you'll forgive my askin',

28:23.860 --> 28:25.827
do you need money?

28:25.862 --> 28:28.830
Oh, thank you,
Reverend O'Malley,

28:28.865 --> 28:31.332
but he had life insurance
and we saved up.

28:31.833 --> 28:34.335
If you need anything ever,

28:34.370 --> 28:37.839
you must come to me.

28:37.874 --> 28:40.842
I won't hear of it otherwise.

28:43.845 --> 28:44.846
All right?

28:44.881 --> 28:48.349
All right, sir.

28:48.384 --> 28:51.853
You're everything
John said you'd be.

28:51.888 --> 28:53.354
Thank you, Mrs. Hill.

29:03.364 --> 29:04.866
Ha!

29:07.368 --> 29:10.872
Love beads for the fag cop.

29:26.888 --> 29:30.391
Gonna take a shower with me,
white boy? Hmm?

29:30.426 --> 29:32.393
Ha ha ha!

29:32.428 --> 29:34.896
All I need is
a place of operation,

29:34.931 --> 29:36.397
for the police, as you know,

29:36.432 --> 29:39.901
are unsympathetic
to our movement.

29:39.936 --> 29:41.903
I don't trust 'em.

29:41.938 --> 29:44.906
Would you help me...

29:45.406 --> 29:47.408
to recover the stolen funds

29:47.443 --> 29:49.911
and to avenge John's death?

29:49.946 --> 29:52.914
Would you be my eyes and ears?

29:52.949 --> 29:56.417
My Mata Hari, so to speak,
on the Lord's side.

29:58.419 --> 30:00.922
Oh, anything.

30:00.957 --> 30:03.424
Oh, anything if you think
I can, Reverend O'Malley.

30:03.459 --> 30:06.928
The main thing is for me
to be free of the police

30:06.963 --> 30:10.431
so that I can conduct
my own investigation.

30:10.466 --> 30:14.435
I've got to find a place to stay

30:14.470 --> 30:16.437
where nobody
will know where I am.

30:16.472 --> 30:19.941
Reverend O'Malley,
why not stay here?

30:24.946 --> 30:28.449
Oh, bless your soul,
Mrs. Hill.

30:30.451 --> 30:32.954
Hey, Copper.

30:32.989 --> 30:35.456
I forgot my towel.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.462
It's, uh, it's right there
on the wall.

30:45.466 --> 30:47.969
You wanna dry
my back off, Copper?

30:53.474 --> 30:55.977
Hey, you gotta
give a girl a minute.

31:31.012 --> 31:35.516
They say the badder the
woman, the better the smell.

31:35.551 --> 31:37.518
Come sniff.

31:47.528 --> 31:51.032
Hey, don't you wanna
take your clothes off?

32:24.100 --> 32:25.566
Please, baby.

32:27.068 --> 32:28.569
Please?

32:34.075 --> 32:36.077
Hey, you come-
hey, come back here, you!

32:36.577 --> 32:37.578
Hey!

32:40.581 --> 32:42.083
Halt!

32:44.085 --> 32:45.586
Halt in the name of the law!

32:45.621 --> 32:48.089
Halt in the name of the law!

33:11.112 --> 33:12.613
Aah!

33:16.152 --> 33:20.121
Come on, lo boy. Come on,
lo boy. Come on, come on.

33:20.621 --> 33:23.624
Quit it! Now, hold it. Hold it right there.

33:23.659 --> 33:27.128
What were you doing on the drive
when the meat truck came by?

33:27.163 --> 33:30.131
Don't bother me, man.
I gotta get to the funeral.

33:30.166 --> 33:32.633
What funeral?

33:34.635 --> 33:37.138
You know what that
meat truck done, man?

33:37.173 --> 33:41.642
It hit my buddy
square in the air.

33:41.677 --> 33:46.647
Oh, Early Riser rose,
man, I mean, like a bird.

33:46.682 --> 33:50.651
I ain't never seen a cat
fly that high before.

33:51.152 --> 33:52.653
He went up!

33:54.155 --> 33:57.158
Man, up on your feet!
Now, you tell us!

33:57.193 --> 33:58.659
Now, what happened?

33:58.694 --> 34:00.161
What happened when?

34:00.196 --> 34:02.163
After the meat truck
hit Early Riser.

34:02.198 --> 34:04.165
H-he died.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.167
He died.

34:06.202 --> 34:09.170
15 years, and then he died.

34:09.205 --> 34:11.172
Man, I gotta find the funeral!

34:11.672 --> 34:14.175
You son of a bitch.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.677
Ed!

34:16.712 --> 34:20.181
God damn it! You better tell
us what we wanna know, man!

34:20.216 --> 34:22.183
You listen to me
and listen good.

34:22.683 --> 34:24.685
The meat truck hit Early Riser and crashed.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.187
The armoured truck crashed, too.

34:26.687 --> 34:28.688
Now, God damn it, you
better tell me what happened!

34:28.724 --> 34:30.690
I seen the truck,

34:30.726 --> 34:33.694
and I seen Barry Waterfield
get the hell out of there.

34:34.195 --> 34:38.199
And I seen these white guys run after him.

34:38.234 --> 34:39.234
White guys?

34:39.699 --> 34:41.202
White guys?
They had on masks.

34:41.237 --> 34:43.204
How did you know
they were white?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.206
Oh, Lordy, help me!

34:45.241 --> 34:48.208
Askin' how you know
they was white.

34:48.708 --> 34:51.212
They run white, damn it.

34:54.715 --> 34:56.717
Honkies in the woodpile.

34:56.752 --> 34:58.219
Something we hadn't figured on.

34:58.254 --> 35:00.221
The syndicate.

35:00.256 --> 35:02.723
Let's get out of here.
It stinks.

35:03.224 --> 35:04.225
Yeah.

35:09.230 --> 35:11.732
Rattin' on the mob ain't
the worst thing in the world.

35:11.767 --> 35:14.235
Any black man might
rat on whitey.

35:14.270 --> 35:16.737
I might, myself.

35:16.772 --> 35:22.243
Man, like Deke preyin' on
his own black flesh and blood.

35:22.278 --> 35:25.746
How you gonna blame Deke for
doin' what everybody else is doin'?

35:25.781 --> 35:29.250
Beats me how you can find any good
at all in the vicious son of a bitch.

35:29.285 --> 35:32.253
Convicting the man without
a trial, ain't you, God?

35:48.769 --> 35:50.271
Sam, take me to the Apollo.

36:17.298 --> 36:19.300
God damn it, none of these
things are gonna work!

36:19.335 --> 36:21.802
Easy, baby, easy.
Watch it.

36:22.303 --> 36:24.305
You're gonna wind up
bustin' something

36:24.805 --> 36:28.309
right between your assets
and your liabilities.

36:28.344 --> 36:30.311
Balloons, fans, feathers!

36:30.811 --> 36:32.813
I'm sick of 'em all!

36:32.848 --> 36:35.816
They're out of style and don't
say a damn thing about my people.

36:35.851 --> 36:37.318
Forget 'em, forget 'em.

36:37.353 --> 36:41.322
'Cause what you got
goin' for you-my, my, my-

36:41.357 --> 36:43.824
ain't never goin' out of style.

36:43.859 --> 36:45.826
Uncle tom is what they are.

36:45.861 --> 36:48.829
My dance has got to say
something about my people.

36:48.864 --> 36:50.331
Black people!

36:50.366 --> 36:53.834
We've got to set our
people's minds to thinkin'.

36:53.869 --> 36:55.836
Get our own
black thing together.

36:56.337 --> 36:57.338
Yeah.

36:58.839 --> 37:00.841
Iris.

37:02.343 --> 37:03.844
Billie, you have
to lend me a dress.

37:03.879 --> 37:06.347
A dress? What the hell you doing here?

37:06.382 --> 37:08.349
Helping Billie with
her new dance routine.

37:08.384 --> 37:11.352
What happened at the rally?
And where's Deke?

37:11.387 --> 37:13.354
I don't know.
Didn't he call you?

37:13.389 --> 37:15.356
What you mean, you don't know?

37:15.856 --> 37:16.857
Don't lie to me, Barry.

37:17.358 --> 37:19.158
Look, I'm not lying.
I don't know where he is.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.861
Oh, just get the hell on
out of here.

37:20.896 --> 37:23.864
I don't need you to help me
to find Deke. Damn.

37:25.366 --> 37:27.868
You must've left off
in a big hurry.

37:27.903 --> 37:29.870
Yeah. You should've seen
the other guy.

37:30.371 --> 37:33.374
Billie, help me to find
a dress and quick. Quick.

37:33.409 --> 37:35.376
Reverend O'Malley.
Reverend-

37:35.411 --> 37:38.879
oh.
Oh. Oh.

37:38.914 --> 37:40.881
Oh.

37:41.382 --> 37:46.887
I'm sorry. I... put my shirt
in the sink to be washed.

37:48.389 --> 37:51.392
I apologize. I...

37:51.427 --> 37:56.397
had to use one of
your husband's robes.

38:01.402 --> 38:02.903
Well...

38:02.938 --> 38:04.405
what did you find out?

38:04.440 --> 38:06.407
I went over to the church
like you told me,

38:06.442 --> 38:07.908
and I saw these two white men.

38:07.943 --> 38:10.411
Yes. I got close enough to listen,

38:10.446 --> 38:15.416
and I found out that they were offering
a reward to anyone for bale of cotton.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.419
Bale of cotton?

38:19.420 --> 38:21.922
Now, what would a bale of
cotton be doing in Harlem?

38:23.924 --> 38:26.427
Bale of cotton.

38:29.430 --> 38:31.432
A bale of cotton.

38:31.467 --> 38:33.434
Is something wrong, Reverend?

38:33.469 --> 38:39.940
A bale of cotton.
Well, I'll be damned!

38:39.975 --> 38:43.944
We have got to find out
what's happened, Sister Mabel.

38:43.979 --> 38:46.447
And surely, Brother John
would want you to help me.

38:46.947 --> 38:48.949
Oh, John.

38:48.984 --> 38:51.952
John - oh, you look so much
like him in that robe.

38:51.987 --> 38:54.955
Just to hear his name
like that, oh, I miss him.

38:55.456 --> 38:57.216
Yes, and I miss him, too,
but listen, Sister-

38:57.458 --> 38:59.960
I need my John. I need
him, too, Sister Mabel, but-

38:59.995 --> 39:02.963
who's gonna take care of me
now that John's gone?

39:02.998 --> 39:05.466
Who's gonna love me?
Who's gonna need me?

39:05.501 --> 39:07.968
Who's gonna be good to me now
that John ain't here no more?

39:08.003 --> 39:10.971
Sister Mabel, I am here,

39:11.006 --> 39:12.473
and I am going to stay here.

39:12.973 --> 39:15.476
And I'm gonna take care of
you, and I'm gonna love you.

39:15.511 --> 39:19.480
But first, I - oh, Reverend
O'Malley, you are so wonderful!

39:19.515 --> 39:21.982
Sister Mabel, hey.
Mabel!

39:22.017 --> 39:23.484
Honey.

39:28.489 --> 39:31.492
Iris. Iris!

39:31.527 --> 39:34.495
Get me out of the way and
shackin' up with that skimpy whore!

39:34.530 --> 39:36.997
Wait a minute! Just wait a
minute! You've got to understand!

39:37.032 --> 39:39.500
Iris, I called you first!

39:40.000 --> 39:42.002
Look, I had to find
someplace to hide out.

39:42.503 --> 39:44.004
Yeah, between this bitch's legs!

39:46.006 --> 39:48.008
Will you two quit it?

39:48.043 --> 39:50.563
The Reverend and I, we're trying
to get back our people's money.

39:51.011 --> 39:54.014
You don't call him that
in the bed! Why, you-

39:54.049 --> 39:57.518
quit it! Stop it!
Stop it, I say, damn it!

39:59.019 --> 40:00.521
Break it up!
Let go of me!

40:00.556 --> 40:02.523
Let go of me!
She can't call me that!

40:07.528 --> 40:08.529
You fool!

40:30.000 --> 40:31.502
Here you are, kid.

40:34.004 --> 40:36.507
Well, if it isn't Caspar Brown,

40:37.007 --> 40:40.010
biggest numbers banker
of them all.

40:40.045 --> 40:41.512
Coloured version.

40:41.547 --> 40:47.017
Hear tell that you and ed been
nosin' around my operation.

40:47.052 --> 40:54.024
Come on. Now, you guys too smart to
think that we knocked over Deke O'Malley.

40:54.059 --> 40:56.026
Bullshit.

40:56.061 --> 40:57.341
How the hell would you ever know

40:57.528 --> 40:59.029
what's happening
in Harlem, Caspar?

40:59.530 --> 41:02.032
'Cause anything
that is happenin'...

41:02.067 --> 41:04.535
I'm the guy that's
makin' it happen.

41:04.570 --> 41:07.538
And don't you forget it.

41:07.573 --> 41:11.542
Stop trying to play
big man, Caspar.

41:11.577 --> 41:14.545
Well, don't think
it ain't been charmin',

41:15.045 --> 41:17.548
but, uh, I promised
these little ladies

41:17.583 --> 41:20.050
I'd take 'em for a little ride.

41:20.085 --> 41:25.556
Uh, I would look upon it kindly
if you let the little ladies go

41:25.591 --> 41:28.058
and took me up to Italian Harlem

41:28.093 --> 41:31.562
to your white mafia boss man.

41:33.564 --> 41:36.567
I said moo goo gai pan.

41:36.602 --> 41:38.569
You call this moo goo gai pan?

41:40.606 --> 41:43.574
Never mind that.
Get it out of here.

41:44.074 --> 41:46.577
And tell Sam to
fix it for me personally.

41:50.581 --> 41:52.082
Thank you, Brother Caspar.

42:01.091 --> 42:04.595
Oh, sit right down
next to the throne of grace.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.101
Hey.

42:12.603 --> 42:15.606
Sure. Ain't you boys
"the man"?

42:15.641 --> 42:17.608
Oh, someday, maybe,

42:18.108 --> 42:21.111
when Caspar gets balls enough
to run you out of Harlem.

42:21.146 --> 42:23.113
But right now you're the man.

42:23.148 --> 42:26.116
Piano, piano.

42:26.617 --> 42:31.121
How's about a little lump
sum of food all around, hmm?

42:32.623 --> 42:35.125
Little tea?

42:38.128 --> 42:41.131
They think we hit O'Malley.

42:41.166 --> 42:45.636
Knock off a coloured rally
and start a race riot, maybe?

42:45.671 --> 42:47.137
Are you crazy?

42:47.172 --> 42:50.140
You had it in for O'Malley. Deke?

42:50.175 --> 42:52.142
Nonsense.

42:52.177 --> 42:54.645
I liked the boy.
Always have.

42:55.646 --> 42:57.648
He's a credit to the community.

42:59.149 --> 43:00.651
He ratted on you.

43:00.686 --> 43:05.656
Where do you think he got that
income tax shit? We fed it to him.

43:05.691 --> 43:09.660
So a couple of the boys
maybe got a little out of line.

43:09.695 --> 43:11.662
Should learn a lesson.

43:11.697 --> 43:13.664
He done us a favour.

43:14.164 --> 43:18.168
If we didn't like him, you
think he'd still be around?

43:18.669 --> 43:22.673
Look, you know what my take
in Harlem is in one day?

43:22.708 --> 43:27.678
You think I would jeopardize
all of that for a lousy $87,000?

43:32.683 --> 43:34.685
All right. $5.00.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.188
What? Cut it down! I'll take
my bale to old man Cohen.

43:38.689 --> 43:41.191
Wait a minute. What do you want from me?

43:41.226 --> 43:45.195
What can I do with this
piece of junk, make bandages?

43:45.230 --> 43:47.197
$10, and that's the last price.

43:47.232 --> 43:50.200
What the hell are you
tryin' to do? Listen.

43:50.235 --> 43:51.702
50.

43:51.737 --> 43:56.206
My name is honest Abe Goodman,
not honest Abe Lincoln.

43:56.707 --> 43:59.209
$15, and that's
my very last price.

43:59.244 --> 44:02.713
This is genuine
Mississippi cotton.

44:02.748 --> 44:04.715
Smell of it.
Smell, schmell.

44:05.215 --> 44:06.717
Cotton is cotton.

44:06.752 --> 44:09.720
Not this cotton! I've picked
cotton all over the south,

44:09.755 --> 44:11.221
and that's the finest.

44:11.256 --> 44:13.724
40.
20. not a dime more.

44:13.759 --> 44:15.726
30, not a cent less.

44:19.229 --> 44:20.731
25?
25?

44:21.231 --> 44:22.232
Sold!

44:45.756 --> 44:46.757
Yes, sir.

44:47.257 --> 44:50.761
You're the old geezer goes
around pickin' up junk, right?

44:50.796 --> 44:52.262
Yes, sir.

44:52.297 --> 44:56.266
Well, I'm in the market
for a bale of cotton.

44:56.301 --> 44:58.769
Understand?

44:58.804 --> 45:01.271
A bale of cotton?
That's right.

45:01.306 --> 45:03.774
And I hear tell that
maybe you could, uh-

45:04.274 --> 45:06.276
you got me wrong, mister.

45:06.311 --> 45:10.280
And anyway, what would a bale
of cotton be doing in Harlem?

45:10.315 --> 45:12.282
Hey! Hey!

45:12.317 --> 45:13.784
Open up!

45:16.787 --> 45:17.788
Hey!

45:17.823 --> 45:20.290
Open up, you old bastard!

45:21.792 --> 45:25.295
Look, white man, ain't you a
long way from where you live?

45:34.304 --> 45:36.306
Was that black enough for you?

45:36.341 --> 45:37.808
It ain't, but it's gonna be.

45:37.843 --> 45:39.309
Ha ha ha!

46:04.334 --> 46:05.836
Is it black enough for you?

46:05.871 --> 46:07.838
Hey, Deke! Hey!

46:07.873 --> 46:10.340
Yeah, all right!
My man!

46:12.843 --> 46:14.344
Hey.

46:14.379 --> 46:16.847
Good times are here now.

46:16.882 --> 46:17.882
How was the Congo, baby?

46:18.348 --> 46:19.428
Fine, beautiful, beautiful.

46:19.850 --> 46:21.570
Man, I never been so scared in all my life.

46:21.852 --> 46:22.853
Me, too, man.

46:22.888 --> 46:24.354
Cops been leaning
on you boys a bit?

46:24.389 --> 46:26.356
Hell no. It was you we was worrying about.

46:26.391 --> 46:27.357
Man, I thought you was dead.

46:27.392 --> 46:30.360
Are you dumb? This man got brains, baby.

46:30.395 --> 46:33.363
I had to lay low for a while.

46:35.866 --> 46:38.869
But I was thinking about
you boys all the time.

46:38.904 --> 46:40.871
And now Deke O'Malley's
back in town.

46:41.371 --> 46:42.372
And you better believe it.

46:42.407 --> 46:44.875
And that means we gonna
take care of business.

46:44.910 --> 46:47.377
Right, Reverend?
'Cause I found it.

46:47.878 --> 46:49.880
I finally found
that bale of cotton.

46:51.381 --> 46:54.885
Brother Barry,
you are beautiful.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.386
Where is that bale of cotton?

46:56.421 --> 46:58.388
Goodman's junkyard.

46:58.423 --> 47:00.390
Goodman's junkyard?

47:00.425 --> 47:02.893
Now, is that
kosher enough for you?

47:02.928 --> 47:03.928
Ha ha ha!

47:05.896 --> 47:08.398
Deke O'Malley
and all the little foxes

47:08.433 --> 47:09.900
present and accounted for.

47:09.935 --> 47:11.902
Hold on there.
What's your rush?

47:11.937 --> 47:13.904
Don't you remember
what your mama says?

47:13.939 --> 47:15.405
I don't play that.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.909
First, Brer Fox
gobbles Brer Rabbit...

47:18.944 --> 47:21.912
and then the wolf
gobbles Brer Fox.

47:43.433 --> 47:45.936
Your move, mother goose.

47:45.971 --> 47:49.940
Okay. Stay put until you see
the white of the rabbit's ass.

48:52.502 --> 48:54.004
Come on.

48:54.039 --> 48:55.505
Let's move. Move out.

49:27.037 --> 49:29.539
White shit
about to hit black fan.

50:17.587 --> 50:20.590
Aah!

51:00.130 --> 51:01.131
Hello, Reverend.

51:02.632 --> 51:06.136
Now back up.
Nice and easy.

51:06.171 --> 51:08.638
Turn around!
Hold it right there.

51:46.676 --> 51:48.178
The white fox?

51:48.213 --> 51:50.680
He left tracks across my behind.

51:50.715 --> 51:53.183
The black fox?

51:53.218 --> 51:55.185
Likewise.

52:20.710 --> 52:21.830
Body count is 6, lieutenant.

52:22.212 --> 52:23.213
Yeah.

52:23.248 --> 52:25.715
To steal junk, I can understand.

52:26.216 --> 52:28.718
A man is desperate,
he needs the money.

52:28.753 --> 52:30.720
But to kill for junk?
I don't get it.

52:31.221 --> 52:33.223
Don't be a boy scout, Goodman.

52:33.258 --> 52:35.725
A lot of people get killed
every day up here for nothing.

52:35.760 --> 52:39.229
What could be here that anyone
could possibly want that badly?

52:39.264 --> 52:41.731
$87,000.

52:41.766 --> 52:43.733
What?

52:43.768 --> 52:46.236
$87,000.

52:46.271 --> 52:47.737
Seen any cotton
around here lately?

52:47.772 --> 52:51.241
A bale of cotton, sure.

52:51.276 --> 52:53.243
Uncle Budd brought over
a bale of cotton.

52:53.278 --> 52:55.745
I bought it from him for $25.

52:57.247 --> 52:58.248
Where is it now?

52:58.283 --> 52:59.749
What?

52:59.784 --> 53:02.252
What happened to it?

53:02.287 --> 53:03.287
He came back later,

53:03.288 --> 53:06.756
he bought it back
from me for $30.

53:06.791 --> 53:08.758
He hauled it away.

53:08.793 --> 53:10.260
Wait a minute.

53:10.295 --> 53:13.263
He brought it in and then
he brung it out again?

53:13.763 --> 53:15.265
It don't add up, Goodman.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.300
That's what happened.

53:16.301 --> 53:18.768
Hauled it away where?

53:18.803 --> 53:21.271
He didn't say.

53:22.272 --> 53:25.275
Put out a reader on Uncle Budd.

53:25.310 --> 53:26.776
Come on, Digger.

53:29.779 --> 53:32.282
To kill for junk.

53:32.317 --> 53:36.286
Well! Did you find it?

53:36.321 --> 53:38.788
What do we got here,
an outraged citizen?

53:38.823 --> 53:40.290
Oh, Reverend O'Malley.

53:40.325 --> 53:42.292
Did you find the man who
stole my people's money?

53:42.792 --> 53:45.795
What were you doing at the junkyard
this hour of the night, Reverend?

53:46.296 --> 53:47.797
Holding a revival meeting?

53:50.300 --> 53:51.801
He was white, whoever he was.

53:51.836 --> 53:52.836
You know the man?

53:53.303 --> 53:54.583
What do you mean, do I know him?

53:54.804 --> 53:58.308
What I mean, sir, is did
you ever meet the man before?

53:58.343 --> 54:01.811
Oh, sure. Same one
who hijacked the rally.

54:01.846 --> 54:05.815
Funny. All the guys
at the rally had on masks.

54:05.850 --> 54:07.817
And, of course, you could
see right through the masks.

54:07.852 --> 54:11.821
Unless, of course, you knew
that they were white in advance.

54:12.322 --> 54:14.824
Have a cigarette.

54:15.825 --> 54:17.327
Where'd you get that?

54:17.362 --> 54:20.330
Mabel hill's apartment,
right where you left it.

54:29.839 --> 54:31.341
That's police brutality.

54:31.376 --> 54:32.376
No, Brother.

54:32.377 --> 54:34.344
That's cancer prevention.

54:34.379 --> 54:36.846
Reverend O'Malley, there are
6 dead bodies in the morgue.

54:36.881 --> 54:38.848
All we're asking you to do is
- now, look!

54:38.883 --> 54:40.350
How many times do I
have to tell you idiots?

54:40.385 --> 54:42.852
We're only asking you to tell
us what you know. Now, look!

54:42.887 --> 54:45.355
Easy, Digger, easy.

54:50.860 --> 54:54.864
Look, I am due in my pulpit
at 11:00 this morning,

54:54.899 --> 54:56.366
and if I ain't there-

54:56.401 --> 54:58.368
if my people were to find out

54:58.403 --> 55:00.370
that you had me locked up in this filthy,

55:00.405 --> 55:02.372
pissy pigsty, there'll be all hell to pay!

55:02.407 --> 55:05.375
What's that supposed to mean?

55:05.410 --> 55:06.876
Draw your own conclusions.

55:06.911 --> 55:09.379
And you can tell Bryce, the
commissioner, and the mayor!

55:09.414 --> 55:10.414
Reverend O'Malley-

55:10.880 --> 55:14.384
take me back
to my cell... honky!

55:16.886 --> 55:18.888
O'Malley!

55:18.923 --> 55:20.890
You forgot your lighter.

55:22.392 --> 55:24.894
Something else you forgot.

55:27.397 --> 55:29.399
Iris, baby, who hit you?

55:29.434 --> 55:30.900
You, you son of a bitch!

55:30.935 --> 55:32.902
But I got your black ass now! Cool it!

55:32.937 --> 55:35.405
Don't tell me to cool it!

55:35.440 --> 55:36.906
You left me for the cops.

55:36.941 --> 55:39.409
Nigger, I oughta kill you!

55:39.444 --> 55:40.910
You already did, baby.

55:40.945 --> 55:42.425
You have nailed his ass
onto the wall,

55:42.447 --> 55:43.913
right here in black and white.

55:43.948 --> 55:46.916
That's right.
I told them everything.

55:46.951 --> 55:48.418
I spilled my guts out.

55:48.918 --> 55:51.921
All about your phony
"back to Africa" swindle.

55:51.956 --> 55:52.956
Names, dates, places.

55:52.957 --> 55:55.425
The way you were gonna
hit all the big cities

55:55.460 --> 55:56.426
and get the money and split.

55:56.461 --> 55:58.928
Iris
- how you set up the switch at the rally,

55:58.963 --> 56:01.931
with the cat supposed to be
from the D.A.'s office.

56:01.966 --> 56:04.434
The way they were gonna pretend
to take you and the money downtown.

56:04.469 --> 56:06.936
But something happened,
and John hill got wasted.

56:07.437 --> 56:09.939
And Mabel hill found out and
was going straight to the cops.

56:09.974 --> 56:12.942
And you found her and tried
to kill her. That's a lie.

56:12.977 --> 56:15.945
I was there!
I saw you, you bastard!

56:15.980 --> 56:18.448
You took that ship, that big,
old black ship black beauty,

56:18.483 --> 56:21.451
and you smashed it down
on that poor girl's head.

56:21.486 --> 56:23.953
I never touched that boat!

56:23.988 --> 56:24.988
Fractured skull.

56:24.989 --> 56:25.989
Negative.

56:25.990 --> 56:27.957
Assault with intent to kill.

56:27.992 --> 56:30.460
If she dies, it's murder one.

56:30.495 --> 56:32.462
Which means we burn you.

56:34.464 --> 56:35.965
Burn me?

56:36.466 --> 56:37.467
Burn me with what?

56:39.469 --> 56:41.471
Lieutenant!

56:41.506 --> 56:42.972
I hope that some
of you damn fools

56:43.007 --> 56:45.487
had the good sense to examine
that model boat for fingerprints.

56:45.510 --> 56:46.976
Of course we did, Reverend.

56:47.011 --> 56:49.479
Tell these two dumb-ass
uncle tom nigger cops of yours

56:49.979 --> 56:52.482
whose prints you found on that boat
- that broad's or mine?

56:52.517 --> 56:55.985
He did it! He took those
people's money. He did it!

56:56.486 --> 56:58.988
You shut your mouth!
I'll get you, O'Malley!

56:59.023 --> 57:01.991
I swear on my mother's grave
I'll get you for this!

57:02.026 --> 57:03.993
I swear I will!
I'll get you!

57:17.323 --> 57:18.825
One more word, soul Brother.

57:19.826 --> 57:20.827
You had it made.

57:21.327 --> 57:23.830
Black folks would have
followed you anywhere.

57:24.330 --> 57:25.832
You could have been
another Marcus Garvey

57:25.867 --> 57:26.907
or even another Malcolm x.

57:27.333 --> 57:29.836
But instead, you ain't nothin'

57:29.871 --> 57:32.338
but a pimp with
a chickenshit backbone.

57:39.846 --> 57:42.849
Break his Goddamn head.

57:42.884 --> 57:43.884
No.

57:43.885 --> 57:47.353
Keep him on ice for 24 hours.

57:47.388 --> 57:49.355
Then he'll bust his own head.

57:49.856 --> 57:50.857
24 hours?

57:50.892 --> 57:53.359
Bryce'll never stand for it.

57:53.394 --> 57:54.394
The hell with Bryce!

57:54.395 --> 57:56.863
O'Malley'll break.

57:56.898 --> 57:58.364
Not only for us.

57:58.399 --> 58:00.366
Everybody in Harlem
will know the son of a bitch

58:00.401 --> 58:01.868
for the evil bastard that he is.

58:02.368 --> 58:04.871
You hold him one more day.

58:04.906 --> 58:06.506
Don't you guys ever
listen to the buzzer?

58:06.873 --> 58:07.873
What's up?

58:07.874 --> 58:08.875
The word just came
over the squawk box.

58:08.910 --> 58:10.376
They just found Uncle Budd.

58:10.411 --> 58:11.878
Did they find a bale of cotton?

58:11.913 --> 58:14.881
Don't ask me.
Ask the squawk box.

58:19.886 --> 58:21.387
Poor Uncle Budd.

58:21.422 --> 58:22.422
What do you suppose

58:22.889 --> 58:24.390
they did to him?

58:24.425 --> 58:27.393
My guess'd be the river.

58:27.428 --> 58:29.896
Oh, my God.

58:31.397 --> 58:32.899
We're dragging the river, Luddy.

58:32.934 --> 58:33.934
You set it up.

58:33.935 --> 58:35.401
Yes, sir.

58:40.406 --> 58:43.409
White fox tasted black blood.

58:43.444 --> 58:44.911
Maybe yes,

58:44.946 --> 58:46.412
and maybe no.

58:46.913 --> 58:48.414
Where the hell's that rabbit?

58:48.449 --> 58:49.916
All right, stop it.

58:49.951 --> 58:51.417
A vicious son of a bitch
murders Uncle Budd,

58:51.452 --> 58:53.419
and you two talk nonsense.

58:54.921 --> 58:57.924
You gotta look on the bright
side, lieutenant.

58:58.424 --> 58:59.425
You saw that white
joker last night.

58:59.460 --> 59:00.460
You identify him?

59:01.928 --> 59:03.429
I don't know, lieutenant.

59:03.464 --> 59:04.931
Maybe yes, maybe no.

59:05.431 --> 59:07.934
All those kind of people
look alike to me.

59:08.434 --> 59:10.436
Cut the crap.
That's an order.

59:10.937 --> 59:12.537
Drop whatever the hell
else you're doing,

59:12.939 --> 59:14.440
and you find him!
And that's final.

59:14.475 --> 59:17.443
We're going home

59:17.478 --> 59:20.446
we're going to see the sun

59:20.481 --> 59:22.949
going home

59:22.984 --> 59:26.452
a new life has begun

59:26.487 --> 59:27.954
we're going home

59:27.989 --> 59:29.455
oh, yes?

59:29.490 --> 59:31.958
Where we can all be free

59:32.458 --> 59:34.460
in the land where there's sand

59:34.961 --> 59:37.463
and I got liberty

59:37.498 --> 59:38.498
so steal away

59:38.965 --> 59:42.468
my Lord, steal away

59:44.005 --> 59:45.471
take me

59:45.506 --> 59:47.473
and I will tell you

59:47.508 --> 59:49.475
we're going home

59:49.976 --> 59:51.477
oh, going home!

59:51.978 --> 59:56.482
Hey, children, going home

59:56.517 --> 59:57.517
wait here.

59:57.518 --> 01:00:00.987
We're going home

01:00:01.022 --> 01:00:03.489
where this world was born

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:08.494
and where life with the strife
won't be tight

01:00:08.529 --> 01:00:09.996
we're going home

01:00:10.031 --> 01:00:11.998
captain, O'Malley's
people are coming.

01:00:12.033 --> 01:00:14.500
O'Malley's people?

01:00:16.502 --> 01:00:19.505
Just like the good book said

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.008
we're going home

01:00:22.043 --> 01:00:23.043
Brothers and Sisters,

01:00:23.044 --> 01:00:24.010
we have marched all the way

01:00:24.045 --> 01:00:26.512
from O'Malley's tabernacle
this afternoon,

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:29.015
not merely for the purpose
of gift-bringing,

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:32.018
but to offer prayers
for his release.

01:00:32.053 --> 01:00:33.053
Amen.
Amen.

01:00:33.054 --> 01:00:35.021
What do you think?

01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:36.522
How many men we got?

01:00:37.023 --> 01:00:39.525
It's Sunday.
Half the men are off.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.028
All right. You better
send out a recall.

01:00:42.063 --> 01:00:43.529
Station house alert.

01:00:43.564 --> 01:00:44.530
We'll try to hold this
right where it is,

01:00:45.031 --> 01:00:48.034
but if anything happens,
if it gets out of control,

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:50.036
go to signal 1039.

01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:51.537
Ok.

01:00:51.572 --> 01:00:59.572
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:01:06.552 --> 01:01:14.552
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:01:23.104 --> 01:01:24.570
People, just settle down.

01:01:27.573 --> 01:01:30.076
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

01:01:30.576 --> 01:01:31.576
Riot.

01:01:31.577 --> 01:01:39.577
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:01:41.587 --> 01:01:44.590
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:47.093
I figure about a 4-block
area, commissioner.

01:01:47.128 --> 01:01:48.594
What are you
standing there for?!

01:01:49.095 --> 01:01:50.096
Get out and get those riot guns!

01:01:50.131 --> 01:01:52.598
I don't give a damn!
Find ed and Digger

01:01:52.633 --> 01:01:54.100
if it takes all afternoon!

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.760
Hold 'em right
where they are-

01:02:02.058 --> 01:02:03.298
now that I have your attention,

01:02:03.559 --> 01:02:04.560
let's bow our heads.

01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:06.562
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:02:07.063 --> 01:02:10.066
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:02:10.566 --> 01:02:14.070
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:16.572
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:02:17.073 --> 01:02:19.075
Who the hell
asked you to come here?

01:02:23.079 --> 01:02:24.580
He will be free,

01:02:24.615 --> 01:02:26.082
but not this way.

01:02:29.085 --> 01:02:31.587
Jarema, they're gonna
try to take O'Malley.

01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:35.591
Don't you worry, Reverend.

01:02:36.092 --> 01:02:38.094
I know how to use this thing,
and I'll protect you

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.595
with the last breath in my body.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:43.599
Oh, I know you will, officer.

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:45.601
I know you will.

01:02:52.108 --> 01:02:53.609
Get out of here!

01:03:02.118 --> 01:03:03.619
Hold it there.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.122
Now cool it!

01:03:19.635 --> 01:03:21.137
Hold it!

01:03:22.138 --> 01:03:23.639
Quiet down!

01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:27.143
All right, get inside.

01:03:27.643 --> 01:03:29.145
What in the Goddamn hell?

01:03:29.645 --> 01:03:30.646
Let 'em inside, officers.

01:03:32.148 --> 01:03:33.149
All right, take those
guns out of here.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:34.184
We'll take it from here.

01:03:37.153 --> 01:03:38.154
Hold it!

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:41.157
Hold it right there!

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.658
Hey, we know what you cops do

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:43.693
in the precinct basement.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.162
How do we know
Deke O'Malley ain't dead?

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:49.165
'Cause I say he ain't!
And I'm the doctor.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.667
You filthy pigs!

01:03:53.169 --> 01:03:54.670
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.672
Shut up, white boy!

01:03:56.707 --> 01:03:58.674
I'm talking about my money!

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:00.676
Me and my family

01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:04.180
put up $1,000, and we ain't
heard from it since.

01:04:05.181 --> 01:04:08.184
If you police don't
do something, we will.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:09.685
Tear the damn precinct down!

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.188
Burn the mother to the ground!

01:04:13.689 --> 01:04:14.690
Give us our money!

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.192
I want my money now!

01:04:16.692 --> 01:04:17.693
I want my money, man.

01:04:26.202 --> 01:04:27.203
Shut up!

01:04:29.705 --> 01:04:31.707
Digger and I
will do our damnedest

01:04:31.742 --> 01:04:34.210
to get the money back.
We promise.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.711
Hell with promises!

01:04:35.746 --> 01:04:36.746
Anybody out there

01:04:36.747 --> 01:04:38.214
ever heard coffin ed
or the grave Digger

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:39.715
make a promise we didn't keep?

01:04:43.219 --> 01:04:45.221
We may have broken some heads,

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:48.224
but we never broke no promises.

01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:53.229
Now go on home!

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.732
Fascist pigs!

01:04:56.767 --> 01:04:59.235
Free Deke O'Malley!

01:05:06.242 --> 01:05:07.743
Commie pigs!

01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:09.745
Fascist commies!

01:05:43.279 --> 01:05:44.780
Where the hell you going?

01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:47.283
Well, ain't this
the going-back-to-Africa rally?

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:48.784
No, Brother. It is
the going-home rally.

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:50.286
Now move it.

01:06:20.816 --> 01:06:22.318
Sergeant, my name is Callahan.

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:23.819
I'm the attorney
for Reverend O'Malley.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.520
I have a writ for his release,

01:06:25.821 --> 01:06:26.822
signed by Judge Glossner.

01:06:27.323 --> 01:06:27.823
This'll take a few minutes.

01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:30.326
Ok. I'll go down
and tell him.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:32.328
I thank all of you.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:35.831
I'm obliged to you
for coming down here

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:38.334
and bringing this great food
for me and my fellow prisoners.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.835
Amen.
Amen.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:42.838
Inasmuch as you've done unto
one of these, my little ones,

01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:43.873
you've done unto me.

01:06:43.874 --> 01:06:44.874
Amen.
Amen.

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:46.342
Just the way you wanted it.

01:06:46.842 --> 01:06:48.344
Praise the Lord, Brother, amen.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.379
What about your tray,

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.846
Sister Minnie?

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:52.348
It's all yours, Reverend.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.850
I thank you, Sister,
but I'd be much obliged

01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:58.354
if you'd take that tray over
to Sister Iris over there.

01:06:59.855 --> 01:07:01.357
Well, if you say so, Reverend.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.359
I do say so, Sister.

01:07:06.362 --> 01:07:07.863
And, Sister Minnie,

01:07:07.898 --> 01:07:10.866
the Lord loveth
a cheerful giver.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:11.901
Amen.
Amen.

01:07:11.902 --> 01:07:12.902
Amen.

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:20.376
A jealous hysterical woman...

01:07:21.877 --> 01:07:25.881
will do anything, including
lie, to hurt O'Malley.

01:07:26.382 --> 01:07:27.383
Is that the case?

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:29.885
No. There's a bale
of cotton,

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.387
the white man
that Digger spotted,

01:07:31.887 --> 01:07:33.889
the shoot-out,
and the vicious murder

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:34.890
of Booker Washington Simms.

01:07:34.925 --> 01:07:35.925
Who?

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:37.893
Uncle Budd, the old junk dealer.

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:39.895
We're still dragging
the river for his body.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.397
And all Ed and Digger want to do

01:07:41.897 --> 01:07:42.898
is hold O'Malley

01:07:42.933 --> 01:07:44.400
for one more day.

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:45.435
What?

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:47.403
They think
that they can-

01:07:47.903 --> 01:07:50.023
don't tell me what they think.
Tell me what you think.

01:07:50.906 --> 01:07:53.409
Or don't you do that anymore?

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:54.910
We could hold him
on a technicality

01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:55.945
for 24 hours,

01:07:56.412 --> 01:07:57.413
it being sunday.

01:07:59.415 --> 01:08:00.916
Jones!

01:08:00.951 --> 01:08:02.418
Johnson!

01:08:09.425 --> 01:08:11.927
Did I or lieutenant Anderson
or anybody else

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:13.429
authorize you
to offer those people money

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:14.464
out there this afternoon?

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:15.930
No, sir.

01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:18.934
Good. Then you recognize
that the precinct

01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:21.937
is in no way responsible
for your foolish statements

01:08:21.971 --> 01:08:22.971
or anything else.

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:25.441
It was getting a little
hairy out there.

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:28.944
It was a flagrant breach
of police procedure.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.947
I won't have it.

01:08:31.982 --> 01:08:33.448
That all, sir?

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:34.484
That is not all!

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:38.453
In spite of the fact
that we came within one inch

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.456
of a riot out there
this afternoon

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.772
and we have no proof whatsoever
against Reverend O'Malley,

01:08:42.957 --> 01:08:44.960
Anderson tells me you want me
to hold him another day.

01:08:44.995 --> 01:08:47.462
That's right, sir.

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.965
You're out of your minds,
both of you.

01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:51.966
Do you have to play
with that thing?

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:54.470
I'm insecure, captain.

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:56.971
But the question still is,

01:08:57.006 --> 01:08:58.974
can we hold him another day?

01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:00.009
I'm not finished.

01:09:00.475 --> 01:09:01.956
You've allowed
your personal prejudice

01:09:01.977 --> 01:09:03.337
to get in the way
of your judgment.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.979
You've bungled this whole thing

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:06.982
from beginning to end.
And you and your partner

01:09:07.017 --> 01:09:08.484
have turned this entire
investigation

01:09:08.984 --> 01:09:09.984
into a personal vendetta
against Reverend O'Malley.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.487
Vendetta?
Vendetta!

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:13.488
O'Malley's a rotten,
thieving, lying-

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:14.990
it doesn't matter what he is.

01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:17.493
It's no concern
of yours anymore.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.495
I'm taking you off the case.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.501
Thank you, sir.

01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:27.502
What?

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:30.005
You want us off the case?

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:32.508
You got us off.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:41.517
What was that all about?

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:43.018
I don't know.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.020
But now I'm really worried.

01:09:46.055 --> 01:09:47.055
Where is Deke?

01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:48.057
There he is.

01:09:48.058 --> 01:09:51.026
No pictures, no pictures.

01:09:55.531 --> 01:09:57.032
Reverend O'Malley.

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:58.067
Yes, sir.

01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.536
Could we have one word
with you in private?

01:10:01.036 --> 01:10:03.038
One word in private.

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:08.544
We understand you're
looking for a white man

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.546
and a bale of cotton.

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.548
We got 'em both.

01:10:19.054 --> 01:10:21.557
Uh, Callahan,
will you excuse me?

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.559
Sister Minnie.

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:25.060
I'll see you later.

01:10:53.589 --> 01:10:56.592
Well, there goes that
$87,000 promise you made.

01:10:57.092 --> 01:10:59.094
We made, old buddy.
We made.

01:10:59.129 --> 01:11:00.596
Yeah, we made.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.598
The next time you're
making out an I.O.U.,

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.600
include me out, huh?

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.102
What we need is some
new bait for that trap.

01:11:07.137 --> 01:11:09.104
A whole new kind of fox.

01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:10.606
Look, man, I'm not in any mood

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:14.109
for another one of your
Goddamn coloured fairy tales.

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:16.111
A stone fox.

01:11:16.146 --> 01:11:17.226
Somebody who wants O'Malley

01:11:17.613 --> 01:11:18.614
worse than we do.

01:11:21.617 --> 01:11:23.619
Hey, lady.

01:11:24.119 --> 01:11:25.639
Where's my pastor?!
Where's my pastor?!

01:11:26.121 --> 01:11:27.623
Now, hold on, now.

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:29.625
What did you-what did you
do with my pastor?

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.627
Wait a minute. Hold it.
Just a minute, now.

01:11:32.127 --> 01:11:33.128
How the hell did you
get in here?

01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:35.130
She's with the delegation.
Don't you remember?

01:11:35.631 --> 01:11:37.633
If y'all don't give me
back my pastor,

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.635
I'm gonna punch you in
the stomach with this umbrella.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:40.670
Now, watch it, lady.

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:42.231
O'Malley ain't here.
He's been released.

01:11:42.638 --> 01:11:44.139
Give me back my pastor.

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:45.641
O'Malley ain't here, I tell you,

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:46.642
and if you don't get
the hell out of here

01:11:47.142 --> 01:11:48.702
with all that noise,
I'm gonna jail you.

01:11:58.654 --> 01:12:00.155
And stay out.

01:12:01.657 --> 01:12:03.158
What's the matter
with that old bag?

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:06.161
My people.

01:12:48.203 --> 01:12:49.204
Iris!

01:12:49.239 --> 01:12:52.207
Don't "Iris" me, you
honey-dripping bastard!

01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:53.709
Let go of me!

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:55.210
Take your hands off her.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:56.245
Cool it, baby.

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:58.213
Get your hands off of me.

01:12:58.248 --> 01:12:59.248
Tie her up.

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:02.217
Nobody two-times Iris
and gets away with it.

01:13:02.252 --> 01:13:04.219
Tie her up, for God's sake.

01:13:06.722 --> 01:13:08.724
Looks like I'm not the only one

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:11.727
our preacher friend's crossed.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:14.229
What the-
what'd he do to you?

01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:15.731
None of your Goddamn business.

01:13:17.232 --> 01:13:18.734
Cut me loose, Calhoun.

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:20.736
Hand over the money,

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:22.237
I'll cut you loose.

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:24.239
How many times do I have
to tell you, you idiot?

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:25.741
I don't know where it's at.

01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:28.744
Mm-hmm.
What about Iris?

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:30.245
She don't know, either.

01:13:31.747 --> 01:13:35.250
Look, man, quit playing games.

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:36.752
Hmm?

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.754
Cut me loose.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.261
Partner!

01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:47.776
Cal, I set the whole
thing up for you.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:50.766
You were nothing
but a dumb convict

01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:53.769
in row "c" till I put you wise.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:56.271
Yeah, you set it up
for me, bastard!

01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:57.773
You set it up for me
to be the patsy

01:13:57.808 --> 01:13:59.274
and you to take
the money and run!

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:01.276
I wouldn't cross you.
Cal, we're partners.

01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:04.279
What about that little
old switch with the D.A.'s men?

01:14:04.314 --> 01:14:06.281
That was just in case
you didn't arrive

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:07.783
with the meat wagon in time.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:10.285
And how about that little
old shoot-out in the junkyard?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.287
I thought you guys were cops.

01:14:12.322 --> 01:14:13.322
I swear it.

01:14:13.323 --> 01:14:15.791
Cal, cut me loose, and we'll go

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:17.292
and find the money and split it!

01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:19.795
Con man to the bitter end.

01:14:21.797 --> 01:14:24.299
I ought to shoot you
right between your black eyes

01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:25.801
for what you done to me,

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.803
but I'm gonna be big about it.

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:31.306
Yeah. I'm gonna let you
buy your life back,

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:33.809
and all it's gonna cost you

01:14:34.309 --> 01:14:35.811
is all that 87 grand

01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:37.813
stashed in that bale of cotton.

01:14:41.316 --> 01:14:42.317
Cotton?

01:14:43.819 --> 01:14:45.821
Is that what this is all about?

01:14:46.321 --> 01:14:47.322
Yeah.

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:49.324
You know something?

01:14:49.825 --> 01:14:52.327
Yeah, I know where it's at.

01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:55.831
All right...

01:14:56.331 --> 01:14:57.332
talk.

01:14:57.367 --> 01:14:58.834
What's in it for me?

01:14:58.869 --> 01:14:59.869
Iris.

01:15:00.335 --> 01:15:02.838
You shut up.

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.840
You talk,

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.342
or I'll blow your brains out.

01:15:07.377 --> 01:15:10.345
Hmmph. Yeah, that'll
get you exactly nowhere.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:13.849
What you ought to do is, uh...

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:16.852
blow that mother's brains out.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:19.354
What?

01:15:19.389 --> 01:15:22.357
Blow that two-timing
mother's brains out.

01:15:23.859 --> 01:15:27.362
Then I'll show you
where the bale of cotton is.

01:15:30.866 --> 01:15:32.367
You do it.

01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:34.369
You untie me, and I will.

01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:35.404
Untie her.

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:40.876
Who followed you here?

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:42.878
How in the hell I know?

01:15:58.393 --> 01:16:00.896
Iris, sweetheart,

01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:02.898
baby, you found it.

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:06.401
You found that bale of cotton.

01:16:06.436 --> 01:16:07.903
Here, come on.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:09.404
Untie these ropes, honey.

01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:10.439
Come on, Iris.

01:16:11.907 --> 01:16:13.408
Yeah, that's right.

01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:14.910
Come on, honey.

01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:17.913
Cut these ropes,
and let's get out-

01:16:18.413 --> 01:16:19.414

01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:24.920
Ha ha! Ha, Iris!

01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:25.955
Iris!

01:16:26.421 --> 01:16:27.422
Ok, baby.

01:16:28.924 --> 01:16:30.926
No, Iris, I don't blame you.

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:32.928
Go ahead.
Do your thing.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.931
But before you kill me,

01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:37.933
would you do me a favour?

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:40.435
Don't beg me, Deke.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.437
I ain't beggin'.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.940
But would you mind
reaching your hand down

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.442
into my pocket

01:16:47.477 --> 01:16:50.445
and taking out that
little old package?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.948
Go ahead, Iris.

01:16:55.951 --> 01:16:57.953
That's it, baby.

01:16:59.955 --> 01:17:01.456
Go ahead.

01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:14.453
Bat?

01:17:14.488 --> 01:17:15.954
Billie boy?

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.462
Halt!

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.481
God damn it!

01:17:42.516 --> 01:17:44.483
Another fine mess
you got us into.

01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:46.985
I got us into?
Shut up and shoot.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:53.992
Hit it again.

01:18:06.505 --> 01:18:08.507
Where are they, Iris?

01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:09.542
Iris!

01:18:09.543 --> 01:18:11.009
Now, where are they?

01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:13.011
I'm talkin' to you!

01:18:13.046 --> 01:18:14.513
Now, where are they?

01:18:16.515 --> 01:18:19.017
All right, Iris.
Where's the door?

01:18:20.519 --> 01:18:22.020
Hey, baby, let's move it.

01:18:28.527 --> 01:18:30.028
I'm gonna get out an APB.

01:18:30.063 --> 01:18:32.030
I'm gonna find those two

01:18:32.065 --> 01:18:34.533

in this precinct.

01:18:36.034 --> 01:18:37.536

01:18:37.571 --> 01:18:39.538
L-i know them.

01:18:39.573 --> 01:18:41.039
Uh, besides,
it was me they tricked.

01:18:41.074 --> 01:18:42.074
Well, then, you get them

01:18:42.075 --> 01:18:44.543
and don't come
back here till you do.

01:18:44.578 --> 01:18:47.045
Yes, sir, captain Bryce.
Yes, sir.

01:18:59.057 --> 01:19:00.559
Attention, all cars.

01:19:00.594 --> 01:19:02.561
Attention, all cars.

01:19:03.061 --> 01:19:05.564
Jones and Johnson have set fire
to house of God.

01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:08.066
Proceeding west on 125th street.

01:19:08.101 --> 01:19:09.568
Apprehend at all costs.

01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:40.599

01:19:40.634 --> 01:19:42.100

01:20:27.145 --> 01:20:28.146

01:20:28.181 --> 01:20:30.148

01:20:30.183 --> 01:20:33.652
it looked like cotton

01:20:33.687 --> 01:20:35.153

01:20:35.188 --> 01:20:37.656

01:23:39.873 --> 01:23:42.340
Reverend O'Malley.

01:23:47.846 --> 01:23:49.848
Oh!

01:23:49.883 --> 01:23:50.883
He's white.

01:23:50.884 --> 01:23:52.350
Ha ha ha.

01:23:53.351 --> 01:23:56.354
He's a white man.

01:23:56.389 --> 01:23:58.356
I just can't believe it.

01:24:00.358 --> 01:24:01.359
He's white!

01:24:01.394 --> 01:24:06.364
The same white man

01:24:06.865 --> 01:24:07.866
of our people's money!

01:24:11.369 --> 01:24:13.872

You know it.

Turn around and face

01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:17.936
Stick out your hands,

Fly this mother to the moon!

01:25:33.451 --> 01:25:35.453
Now let's get on with the show.

01:25:40.959 --> 01:25:44.462
Down in my soul

01:25:44.497 --> 01:25:47.966
a girl who's always rockin'

01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:50.969
down in my soul

01:25:51.004 --> 01:25:52.971
that old black road squawkin'

01:25:53.006 --> 01:25:54.006

01:25:56.009 --> 01:25:57.475

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.478
a fella can't stop rollin'

01:26:00.513 --> 01:26:03.982
down in my soul

01:26:04.017 --> 01:26:05.984
drivin' what's been stolen

01:26:06.985 --> 01:26:08.987
down in the marshland

01:26:09.487 --> 01:26:12.991
you can find my soul there...

01:26:19.497 --> 01:26:20.999
down in my soul

01:26:23.536 --> 01:26:25.003
a girl who's always rockin'

01:26:25.503 --> 01:26:26.503
oh, yeah

01:26:26.504 --> 01:26:30.008
down in my soul

01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:32.010
a fella that can't stop rollin'

01:26:32.045 --> 01:26:34.512
down in the marshland

01:26:35.013 --> 01:26:38.516
you can find my soul there...

01:26:41.519 --> 01:26:43.521
aah!

01:26:45.023 --> 01:26:47.525
Hold it, man.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.527
Hold it right there.

01:26:49.562 --> 01:26:52.530
This ain't gonna get us nowhere.

01:26:54.532 --> 01:26:58.036
Man...

01:26:58.071 --> 01:27:04.042
there's $87,000 in that bale.

01:27:04.077 --> 01:27:06.544
50-50.

01:27:06.579 --> 01:27:08.546
Right down the middle.

01:27:08.581 --> 01:27:10.548
You steal money
from white folks,

01:27:10.583 --> 01:27:12.050
that's your business.

01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:15.553
But when you steal from blacks,

01:27:15.588 --> 01:27:16.588
that's my business.

01:27:18.056 --> 01:27:21.559
You sound just like my father.

01:27:21.594 --> 01:27:23.561
Part preacher...

01:27:25.063 --> 01:27:27.565
part undertaker...

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.068
and part God.

01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:33.571
Why don't you take it easy, man?

01:27:33.606 --> 01:27:35.573
Cool it. What's
the matter with you?

01:27:35.608 --> 01:27:38.576
Black people been exploited
by white people.

01:27:39.077 --> 01:27:42.580
Filth like you come along
skin 'em some more.

01:27:42.615 --> 01:27:46.084
Judgment, Deke.
Judgment.

01:27:46.584 --> 01:27:49.087
All right, man, all right.

01:27:49.122 --> 01:27:52.090
You, you keep the whole thing.

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:54.592
I'll walk out of here,

01:27:54.627 --> 01:27:56.594
and I promise you,

01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:58.596
I'll never show my face
in Harlem again

01:27:58.631 --> 01:28:01.099
as long as I live.

01:28:01.134 --> 01:28:03.101
Well?

01:28:03.136 --> 01:28:04.602
That's what you want, ain't it?

01:28:05.103 --> 01:28:06.103
No.

01:28:06.104 --> 01:28:08.606
I want you.

01:28:13.611 --> 01:28:14.612
Ed! Ed, listen!

01:28:15.113 --> 01:28:18.116
For God's sake,
give me a chance!

01:28:18.616 --> 01:28:20.118
I could be another-

01:28:20.153 --> 01:28:23.121
another Garvey, man!
Another Malcolm!

01:28:24.122 --> 01:28:25.623
Aah!

01:28:30.128 --> 01:28:31.129
God damn you!

01:28:31.629 --> 01:28:32.630
I'll kill you!

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.641
Don't touch me!

01:28:53.151 --> 01:28:54.652
No, no! No!

01:28:57.655 --> 01:28:58.656
No!

01:29:01.659 --> 01:29:03.161
Shoot him, Iris!

01:29:19.677 --> 01:29:20.678
Aah!

01:29:23.181 --> 01:29:25.183
Jarema, she's your prisoner.

01:29:25.218 --> 01:29:27.185
Now, look, you might even
make first-grade Detective.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.187
The money, it's in the bale.

01:29:30.688 --> 01:29:31.689
Yes, sir.

01:29:33.191 --> 01:29:36.694

01:30:58.811 --> 01:31:00.278
here, give me that mike.

01:31:00.313 --> 01:31:01.779
Brothers and Sisters,

01:31:01.814 --> 01:31:05.783
I just want to talk to you...

01:31:05.818 --> 01:31:06.818
for a minute!

01:31:07.285 --> 01:31:08.786
He'll hang himself.

01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:10.288
Hear. Hear, hear.

01:31:10.323 --> 01:31:11.789
Brothers and Sisters,

01:31:11.824 --> 01:31:14.292
I want to talk to you.
I want-i want-

01:31:14.792 --> 01:31:15.793
God damn it!

01:31:15.828 --> 01:31:17.295
Hey, wait a minute!

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:18.330
That's our preacher?

01:31:18.796 --> 01:31:21.299
Brothers, Sisters,

01:31:21.334 --> 01:31:24.802
these two here
want to beat me to death,

01:31:24.837 --> 01:31:27.805
want to beat me, Deke O'Malley.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.307
You blew it, Deke!

01:31:29.342 --> 01:31:30.342
Get out of here!

01:31:30.808 --> 01:31:32.810
No, no. Listen.

01:31:33.311 --> 01:31:34.812
Listen, now.

01:31:34.847 --> 01:31:37.315
L-listen, now. Ha.

01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:39.317
I got-i got...

01:31:39.817 --> 01:31:40.818
listen to me!

01:31:40.853 --> 01:31:42.820
I got something to tell you!

01:31:44.322 --> 01:31:46.324
Listen. No, no, no.

01:31:46.359 --> 01:31:48.326
No, no. No!

01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:50.828
No, don't-
don't turn your backs.

01:31:50.863 --> 01:31:52.830
Don't. Listen to me.

01:31:53.331 --> 01:31:55.833
Don't turn your backs on me.

01:31:58.836 --> 01:32:00.338
No. No, listen to me.

01:32:00.373 --> 01:32:01.373
Listen to me.

01:32:01.839 --> 01:32:03.841
Listen!

01:32:03.876 --> 01:32:05.343
I can be like Malcolm!

01:32:05.843 --> 01:32:07.345
Believe me!

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:09.347
Don't turn your backs on me!

01:32:09.382 --> 01:32:11.849
Don't turn your backs-

01:32:16.854 --> 01:32:18.856
Jarema, what the hell
is going on here?

01:32:18.891 --> 01:32:20.858
Oh!

01:32:20.893 --> 01:32:22.360
It's empty, Luddy.

01:32:22.395 --> 01:32:23.395
What's empty?

01:32:23.396 --> 01:32:27.365
Damn cotton bale is empty.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.866
Ha!

01:32:28.901 --> 01:32:30.368
Where are they?

01:32:30.403 --> 01:32:33.871
Where the hell are those
2 cops who was here?

01:32:33.906 --> 01:32:35.873
What, you mean
coffin ed and grave Digger?

01:32:35.908 --> 01:32:37.375
Yeah.

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:40.378
Oh, man.
They've been gone.

01:32:45.383 --> 01:32:47.385
$87,000.

01:32:47.885 --> 01:32:49.387
What the hell for?

01:32:49.422 --> 01:32:50.422
Your whole operation

01:32:50.423 --> 01:32:52.890
is sittin'
on a black volcano, man.

01:32:52.925 --> 01:32:53.925
Right, Caspar?

01:32:53.926 --> 01:32:55.893
Uh, I'm afraid he's right, tom.

01:32:55.928 --> 01:32:59.397
You see, tom, things
have changed up here.

01:32:59.432 --> 01:33:00.898
Black people are thinking about

01:33:00.933 --> 01:33:03.401
taking over white businesses.

01:33:03.436 --> 01:33:04.436
Right, Caspar?

01:33:04.437 --> 01:33:07.405
Right. I was just
reading an article

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.407
on black capitalism.

01:33:09.442 --> 01:33:11.409
That's right.

01:33:11.444 --> 01:33:13.411
And there ain't no capitalism

01:33:13.446 --> 01:33:14.412
bigger than yours in Harlem.

01:33:14.447 --> 01:33:16.414
Right, Caspar?

01:33:16.449 --> 01:33:17.449
Right.

01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:21.919
Now, the way I see things
is, uh, is organization.

01:33:21.954 --> 01:33:24.922
Uh, and not only new blood,

01:33:24.957 --> 01:33:26.424
but black blood,

01:33:26.459 --> 01:33:30.428
improvin' the operation
around here.

01:33:30.463 --> 01:33:34.432
Uh, seems to me that
there's a whole lot of money

01:33:34.467 --> 01:33:36.434
uh, in just being black
these days.

01:33:37.935 --> 01:33:39.135
So there's got to be some way.

01:33:39.437 --> 01:33:40.938
Hmm?

01:33:40.973 --> 01:33:42.440
Sit down.

01:33:47.945 --> 01:33:52.950
How much is it gonna cost me
to stop this kind of talk?

01:33:52.985 --> 01:33:55.953
$87,000.

01:34:03.461 --> 01:34:05.463
Well, that bale was empty.

01:34:05.498 --> 01:34:07.965
That money must have
been planted in there.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.467
Planted?

01:34:09.502 --> 01:34:10.968
By who, you idiot?

01:34:11.469 --> 01:34:12.970
Jones and Johnson?

01:34:14.472 --> 01:34:16.974
Well, I still say the-
the bale was empty.

01:34:17.009 --> 01:34:18.976
Well, it sure ain't empty now.

01:34:19.011 --> 01:34:20.478
Lieutenant, I think
you better count it.

01:34:20.513 --> 01:34:21.513
Don't you?

01:34:21.514 --> 01:34:22.514
Mm-hmm.

01:34:22.515 --> 01:34:23.515
Oh, I bet it's all here.

01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:24.982
Well, perhaps sergeant Jarema

01:34:25.017 --> 01:34:26.484
ought to count it himself.

01:34:26.519 --> 01:34:28.986
You tricked me.

01:34:29.487 --> 01:34:31.489
I don't know how you two
black bastards did it,

01:34:31.524 --> 01:34:32.990
but you tricked me.

01:34:33.025 --> 01:34:34.492
Jarema,

01:34:34.527 --> 01:34:36.994
I want you to apologize
to these two officers

01:34:37.029 --> 01:34:38.496
for that racial slur,

01:34:38.531 --> 01:34:39.997
or I'll have your badge.

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.503
Aw, I apologize, but...

01:34:46.003 --> 01:34:47.004
but...

01:34:49.507 --> 01:34:51.509
you'll, uh, have to
overlook Jarema.

01:34:52.009 --> 01:34:54.011
He's... had a bad day.

01:34:55.513 --> 01:34:56.514
Haven't we all?

01:34:57.515 --> 01:34:59.016
May we go, captain?

01:34:59.051 --> 01:35:02.019
May you-
of course.

01:35:02.054 --> 01:35:03.521
Congratulations.

01:35:03.556 --> 01:35:05.022
Thank you, sir.

01:35:06.023 --> 01:35:08.025
Ed, Digger.

01:35:08.526 --> 01:35:10.027
Tell me something, will ya?

01:35:10.062 --> 01:35:13.030
What's a bale of cotton
doing in Harlem?

01:35:19.036 --> 01:35:22.540
"Dear Grave Digger Jones
and coffin Ed Johnson..."

01:35:22.575 --> 01:35:25.042
If you're
still dragging the river

01:35:25.077 --> 01:35:27.545
looking for the body
of Old Uncle Budd

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.547
and the 87,000,

01:35:29.582 --> 01:35:30.582
stop.

01:35:30.583 --> 01:35:32.550
I am now a retired gentleman

01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:36.053
raising cotton on my villa
in Africa.

01:35:36.088 --> 01:35:38.556
If you are ever
in this neck of the woods,

01:35:38.591 --> 01:35:40.558
please drop in and see me.

01:35:40.593 --> 01:35:44.061
"Yours truly,
Booker Washington Simms."

01:35:44.096 --> 01:35:45.096
Ha ha ha!

01:35:45.097 --> 01:35:47.565
Better known as Old Uncle Budd.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600
Ha ha ha ha!
