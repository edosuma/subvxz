01:12.673 --> 01:14.241
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.344
You good?

01:20.313 --> 01:21.081
Yeah.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.417
I'm ready.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.107
- Checkmate!
- Oh!

01:49.109 --> 01:51.779
Oh, I... I almost forgot.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.282
You loaned this to me
in like second grade.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.053
Keep it. You can bring it
when you visit.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.890
I asked my mom, and
she said it's way too far.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.027
Hey, Chester, your mom texted!

02:11.364 --> 02:12.866
Hey, sweetie.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.034
So, tell her we're going to come up

02:14.067 --> 02:15.869
and say goodbye one more time
before tomorrow.

02:15.903 --> 02:16.937
- Okay.
- Okay?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.372
- Bye! Bye, Mack!
- Bye, Chester.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.440
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, Chester!

02:20.473 --> 02:21.942
- Oh! Hey!
- Hey, buddy!

02:21.975 --> 02:23.110
Hey, what's going on, man!

02:23.143 --> 02:24.111
- How's it going?
- What is up?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.546
What up, man?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.080
Ross & Daughters!

02:27.114 --> 02:29.950
You guys, I can't take
another goodbye. I can't.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.085
No problem, because
we're kidnapping you.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.755
You guys are
like a little behind in here.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.924
- Dude, we got packers.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.226
- You got packers?
- Packers.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.695
Okay! You really did get
a good job. Congratulations!

02:41.729 --> 02:43.063
Tenure track!

02:43.096 --> 02:46.066
- You making money!
- Nice!

02:47.467 --> 02:48.969
I'm gonna miss you guys.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.070
Miss you too, man.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.376
- To your second book, man!
- I hope so.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.145
- Yeah, yeah.
- I have to.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.412
If I don't want to write about

02:59.446 --> 03:00.781
food the rest of my life.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.619
- Wow!
- Whoo!

03:05.653 --> 03:06.954
Age-defying!

03:06.987 --> 03:09.056
I still don't understand what's
so great about this job, though.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.092
Man, New York is over
if you're a real artist.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.061
She started out, so...

03:14.094 --> 03:16.597
It's stability. It's health insurance.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.265
- It's retirement.
- Okay.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.801
Plus, we just want to see
what else is out there.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.772
Racism!

03:24.805 --> 03:26.473
That's everywhere.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.608
You racist.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.310
I'm a little racist.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.639
We'll visit every summer.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.608
We can come to the studio too.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.975
But someone else will be in it.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.844
Yeah, but we'll still have
friends in the building.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.030
- Can I get three of these?
- Biscotchos?

04:23.063 --> 04:24.064
Yes.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.166
And some dulce de leche.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.402
- All right.
- And pasta fulla.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.971
Big order?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.906
Yeah, just in need of memories
at this point.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.243
Hi, Clarky!

04:36.276 --> 04:38.812
I was really hoping
I would see you today.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.180
Sorry, again, about the party.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.582
- Oh, don't worry.
- Amir's going too.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.750
I had to see him off, you know.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.518
They are doing so great!

04:44.552 --> 04:47.220
Oh, they're struggling,
like everybody, believe me.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.259
I mean, we bought a house,

04:52.292 --> 04:54.895
and I'm the only one who's
had a chance to see it.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.864
What if they hate it?

04:56.897 --> 05:00.067
Hey! You're taking a risk.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.870
- You are such a strong person!
- Mmm.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.206
It might get nutty,
but you are moving to Rome!

05:08.709 --> 05:09.743
It's an adventure.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.880
Rome.

05:15.716 --> 05:19.052
Rome, Washington.

05:33.967 --> 05:39.106
You know, we're so close to
Aunt Vizey and Uncle Joe now.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.975
And you haven't seen your
cousin, William, for years.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.411
I... I bet he wants to see you.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.748
Yeah, to make fun of me.
He called me a "Blerd."

05:47.781 --> 05:50.818
What? He's an honor student too.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.176
Uh... This is huge.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.679
Let's look around! Let's see stuff.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.614
Whoa, we could play Nerf in here!

06:20.648 --> 06:23.851
Yeah, I know. We can have
like a whole like...

06:23.884 --> 06:27.655
Was gonna say ping-pong table,
but that might be a bit crazy.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.191
That smell...

06:31.224 --> 06:34.995
Yeah, it smells like g...
Green, right? Like trees.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.096
Clark, do you want to see your room?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.230
Okay!

06:40.801 --> 06:43.136
Behold! This is your room!

06:44.738 --> 06:46.373
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.240
And listen.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.377
It's so quiet.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.148
And this is our room, I think.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.817
There's a bathroom!

06:56.850 --> 06:58.986
- We have our own bathroom!
- Uh-huh!

06:59.019 --> 07:01.054
It's amazing, right?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.323
There's like bathrooms everywhere.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.193
There's another closet right there.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.327
Do you like it?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.329
I like it.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.734
Thank you.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.256
- Very nice!
- Yeah, right? We got a car!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.728
I guess we'll be living off
Big Mart for a while.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.503
What's this?

07:49.537 --> 07:52.573
I kind of put off telling you,
but the gas range is broken.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.374
- What?
- But they said they'd fix it.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.343
They promised soon.

07:56.376 --> 07:59.580
Oh, but I need to cook for my article.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.449
I know, I'm sorry, but
we'll have fun, though, right?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.219
With our plastic forks.
One shared towel.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.689
All right, all right.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.224
Just don't expect much gourmet
cooking for a while.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.629
And no smoking in my brand new car.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.265
- Your car?
- My car.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.800
- Your car?
- My car.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.734
You know what?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.737
I am quitting.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.273
And it's starting right now.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.541
- So...
- Excellent!

08:27.575 --> 08:28.742
Mmm-hmm.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.831
Come into my lair.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.365
You mean, your raft.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.536
Yes. It's recently inflated.

09:28.569 --> 09:32.139
Oh, my God, I get to...

09:34.041 --> 09:35.876
It feels so weird.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.348
Oh, shit...

09:42.382 --> 09:44.351
- What happened?
- What?

09:45.653 --> 09:48.488
I did something wrong.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.860
That was so scary! Are you okay?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.995
- Come to my lair.
- It's kind of fun.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.933
We're going to sink!

10:13.180 --> 10:14.582
Hi!

10:14.615 --> 10:16.917
I'm your new neighbor,
Diane Hansen, five down.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.886
Oh, hi! Gina McNulty.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.120
I have a little gift for ya.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.991
Aw, thanks.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.026
A little friend in there.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.528
He's so cute!

10:28.529 --> 10:29.396
Yeah.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.934
Biscotti and coffee is the
perfect morning snack.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.869
Right?

10:35.903 --> 10:38.539
Oh, good! Okay, it's all I have, so...

10:38.572 --> 10:40.741
First time I had biscotti
was in Rome, Italy.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.844
Oh! Hey, hon. This is my son, Clark.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.879
This is our new neighbor, Diane.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.615
Oops. You mean Mrs. Hansen.

10:48.716 --> 10:52.019
- Oh! Of course.
- Hi.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.255
Hi! Nice shirt!

10:55.288 --> 10:58.058
So, y'all are from Seattle, I hear.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.226
We're from New York City.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.028
- New York City?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.630
Oh, my gosh! Why on Earth
did you move here?

11:03.797 --> 11:06.567
Well, I, uh, got a job at the college.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.469
In the School of Art.
I'm a photographer.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.971
I thought all the art was in New York!

11:12.239 --> 11:13.373
I know. Well...

11:13.406 --> 11:16.109
So, Clark, what's your dad
gonna do while you're here?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.045
He's gonna try to write another novel,

11:18.078 --> 11:20.313
but right now, he's on deadline
from his Gastronomica piece.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.552
- Gastronomica?
- Oh, it's um...

11:24.585 --> 11:26.053
It's a food magazine.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.789
He's actually writing
this piece about, uh,

11:28.822 --> 11:31.792
cooking video blogs,
where they cook French food.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.595
Yum! You are so interesting!

11:35.763 --> 11:37.430
I hope you like it here.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.502
Oh, I was just done, honestly.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.337
You know, competing with
droves of 20-year-olds

11:44.371 --> 11:48.108
for some gallery show in outer Bushwick,
where nothing is even gonna...

11:48.141 --> 11:50.277
- Hey!
- Oh, hey!

11:50.310 --> 11:53.280
Hi! I'm Mack Burns.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.382
Wow!

11:56.283 --> 11:59.953
Oh, my gosh. I am so rude!

11:59.987 --> 12:01.855
Hey, Clark, what are you doing later?

12:01.889 --> 12:04.758
I have two rising six-graders up the
street who are dying to meet you!

12:04.792 --> 12:07.194
- Do you swim?
- No.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.395
- Yes, you do.
- Yes, you do!

12:09.296 --> 12:10.230
Since you were three.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.857
- Hi!
- Hi.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.193
- Ambrosia Lynn Reid.
- Julie Ann Hansen.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.663
Clark Clayton Burns. Nice to meet you.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.898
Charmed, indeedy!

12:54.007 --> 12:55.609
Sit there. Julie and I have to talk.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.316
Oh, my God!

13:03.350 --> 13:05.018
- What?
- I can't believe it!

13:05.786 --> 13:06.787
He's cute!

13:08.622 --> 13:10.691
We like totally needed a black kid!

13:12.259 --> 13:13.861
What?

13:13.894 --> 13:17.598
This town. It's like so white!

13:23.270 --> 13:25.372
This thing is for hobbits.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.608
Welcome to Coast to Coast Movers.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.910
All of our operators are currently busy.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.780
We appreciate your patience
and will be with you shortly.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.371
So, do you like rap?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.240
Um... Depends on what kind.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.809
What about 2-BIT?

14:02.776 --> 14:03.944
I've never really liked her.

14:05.012 --> 14:05.913
So what, then?

14:07.748 --> 14:13.654
Afropunk, uh... Bjork,
'90s hip-hop, and free jazz?

14:15.756 --> 14:18.592
- But where are you from again?
- Brooklyn.

14:18.626 --> 14:20.493
All the rappers are from Brooklyn.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.096
So what's that like?

14:23.130 --> 14:26.934
Well, it's just really busy
and crazy and fun.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.070
And annoying and loud,
but it's worth it.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.004
You see famous people.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.507
Cool!

14:37.144 --> 14:38.646
Mr. Burns?

14:38.679 --> 14:40.113
Yes, yes, I'm here!

14:40.147 --> 14:42.583
Yeah, unfortunately,
your truck is delayed, but...

14:42.616 --> 14:44.351
- Ugh!
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.786
I'll put you through
to the tracking system now.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.788
No, no, please!

14:48.689 --> 14:50.390
- Nice.
- Hi.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.025
Hi.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.060
Oh, no!

14:55.729 --> 14:57.831
This sucks.

14:57.865 --> 14:59.700
'Cause these clowns
keep putting me on hold.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.935
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

15:01.969 --> 15:05.806
Um... Isn't the delivery
window seven to 10 days?

15:06.874 --> 15:09.209
Well, now, I don't even know.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.512
- You want half this?
- Sure. Thanks.

15:11.545 --> 15:13.013
Welcome to Coast to Coast Movers.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.447
I can't understand what you said.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.283
Because I wasn't speaking to you.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.553
Okay, to schedule a move, say,
"Make reservation."

15:19.587 --> 15:23.023
For your vehicle's location,
say, "Track my truck."

15:23.056 --> 15:25.559
Track my truck!

15:25.593 --> 15:27.494
Please hold for a customer
service representative.

15:27.528 --> 15:28.996
Oh, hey, what's the Wi-Fi?

15:29.029 --> 15:31.198
No Wi-Fi.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.900
They won't be in our area
until the end of the month,

15:32.933 --> 15:34.668
which is why I have to do
everything on this.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.169
Ugh.

15:38.939 --> 15:42.475
Oh. Hey, look.

15:42.510 --> 15:43.944
This got mixed in somehow.

15:45.513 --> 15:47.247
- Nice!
- Yeah.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.582
When was that?

15:48.616 --> 15:50.718
Well, it was your birthday.

15:50.751 --> 15:53.420
So it was probably two years
ago this week?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.622
Hmm.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.592
I really want your birthday
to be special.

15:58.626 --> 16:01.294
Do you think that William and
Joe and Vizey can come visit?

16:02.362 --> 16:03.631
She arguing a big case.

16:05.232 --> 16:09.002
Yeah. Oh! Maybe William
can just come by himself.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.404
- He could.
- Yeah. It's like three hours away.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.040
- Mmm-hmm.
- He can just take the bus.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.375
- Hi!
- Hi.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.844
How did it go?

16:16.877 --> 16:17.911
For your vehicle's location,

16:17.945 --> 16:19.913
- say, "Track my truck."
- Say it, say it.

16:19.947 --> 16:22.349
Track my truck!

16:22.382 --> 16:25.218
I can't understand
what you said. Please hold.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.721
Well?

16:27.755 --> 16:30.057
It was good. They're popular girls.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.225
They're allowed to have phones.
They text all the time.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.794
- Okay.
- So you like them?

16:35.462 --> 16:36.864
They invited me back tomorrow.

16:36.897 --> 16:38.966
Did they? Are you going?

16:39.800 --> 16:40.901
I don't know.

16:50.978 --> 16:53.881
Hello, young ladies! I'm Clark's father.

16:53.914 --> 16:56.283
- Hi!
- Hi.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.720
Is one of your parents home,
so I can just say, "Hi"?

16:59.753 --> 17:01.354
Uh, Mom's at work. Dad's at the store.

17:02.923 --> 17:05.726
Oh, okay. Um...

17:05.759 --> 17:07.094
And they're okay with this?

17:08.127 --> 17:09.730
Bye, Dad!

17:09.762 --> 17:13.433
Bye. But, Clark,
borrow a phone, and call me.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.434
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:15.135 --> 17:15.969
Bye.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.837
- Can I help you?
- Can you help me?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.306
Oh, oh, hey, hi! Yes!

17:53.340 --> 17:55.375
Hello, welcome to the neighborhood!

17:56.510 --> 17:58.612
Thank you! Do I know you?

17:58.646 --> 18:00.881
Oh, no, no, no. I... I heard
that you guys were moving in.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.616
You bought the McKorzel place, right?

18:02.650 --> 18:05.485
- Yes.
- Your wife is the new hire in Art!

18:05.519 --> 18:07.955
- Yes.
- I'm Tom Gibson.

18:07.988 --> 18:11.324
Mack Burns. But I'm sure you knew that.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.662
Yeah. I'm the Head
of the Block Association.

18:14.695 --> 18:16.730
- Really?
- So I've got to be extra friendly.

18:16.764 --> 18:17.865
- Hey, Tom!
- You are!

18:17.898 --> 18:18.999
Aw, thank you!

18:22.703 --> 18:24.204
- Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you too.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.907
Yeah. Hey, you guys ever need anything,

18:27.374 --> 18:28.375
I'm your man!

18:29.076 --> 18:30.310
- Okay!
- All right.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.846
- All right, Block Association.
- Take care.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.516
Protecting us!

18:35.549 --> 18:37.184
Actually, that's Neighborhood Watch.

19:11.952 --> 19:14.387
So what, I'm hearing is that we agree

19:14.421 --> 19:17.357
that the phrase
"Epistemological Journey" is working,

19:17.390 --> 19:21.428
but that we disagree on the
meaning of "Epistemological."

19:21.461 --> 19:23.363
- Did I get you?
- Yes.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.934
I'm sorry. Helena Wisdom-Vickstein.

19:26.967 --> 19:29.402
Computer historian, dramaturge, klutz.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.438
Gina McNulty.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.806
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.708
Nice to meet you.

19:34.742 --> 19:37.410
So are you a fancy consultant from
the "We'll Make You Better" firm

19:37.444 --> 19:38.612
that the Dean brought in?

19:38.646 --> 19:41.782
No. No, definitely not.
I'm Art Department.

19:41.815 --> 19:43.316
The new hire!

19:43.350 --> 19:45.418
- Yeah.
- I've heard about you!

19:45.452 --> 19:46.954
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

19:46.987 --> 19:48.989
I am so sorry you have to sit through

19:49.022 --> 19:51.559
- this orientation retreat BS.
- Oh...

19:51.592 --> 19:52.960
Total ass-numb-er.

19:52.993 --> 19:54.762
You through, Helena?

19:54.795 --> 19:58.198
I am, Maureen. Please. Continue.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.901
I'm... I'm sorry, everyone, but...

20:00.934 --> 20:02.736
Control freak!

20:02.770 --> 20:04.572
- Shh!
- Shh!

20:04.605 --> 20:08.609
And really drill down to
our values as educators,

20:08.642 --> 20:11.779
to remain steadfast in our
commitment to liberal arts colleges

20:11.812 --> 20:14.114
that don't have to engage

20:14.147 --> 20:16.283
- with responsibility center management.
- Psst!

20:19.152 --> 20:21.021
Oh!

20:21.054 --> 20:25.258
That is the core of the
liberal arts education.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.628
Hi, I'm Adam Roberts,
The Amateur Gourmet,

20:27.661 --> 20:29.930
here with my cameraman and
husband, Craig. Say Hi, Craig.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.599
Bonjour, Adam and Craig!

20:31.632 --> 20:33.300
Okay, so today we're going
to learn some things

20:33.333 --> 20:34.768
that everyone should know how to do.

20:34.802 --> 20:36.604
It's a simple bechamel sauce.

20:36.637 --> 20:39.306
I'm two steps ahead of you, darling.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.041
It's an easy sauce.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.678
And the foolproof way to get
a perfect consistency,

20:44.712 --> 20:46.947
is to have the sauce like this when
you add the butter. And you know,

20:46.980 --> 20:49.216
it sounds like a small thing, but
it's actually a really big deal.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.584
It uses an extra pot, but...

20:52.085 --> 20:53.286
- God!
- This cautionary measure

20:53.320 --> 20:55.288
may be seen to be necessary.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.658
It's a lot like the souffle
we made on our last show.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.694
It sounds intimidating, but once you get
the basics down, it's really simple,

21:00.728 --> 21:02.229
and people will enjoy it.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.665
So, let's get going.

21:04.698 --> 21:05.933
First, we'll need a few ingredients.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.838
Prepare flour, heated milk,
and salt and pepper.

21:10.871 --> 21:13.306
And that's it! That's your
bechamel sauce.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.544
I know it's a really fancy name
for something really simple.

21:16.577 --> 21:19.412
And finally, I just wanted
to share a few images

21:19.446 --> 21:22.516
from a series involving women

21:22.550 --> 21:27.087
performing private
stereotypically female, uh,

21:27.120 --> 21:29.790
domestic acts on the streets
of New York.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.997
My work is always engaged with the
idea of gender performativity.

21:37.030 --> 21:41.034
And here, specifically,
I'm looking to Cindy Sherman,

21:41.068 --> 21:45.272
Nan Goldin and Lorna Simpson who
also interrogate social categories.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.110
This series was shown last
year at the ICP Triennial.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.248
So that's... That's it.

21:56.483 --> 22:00.287
And I... I just really wanted
to say, again,

22:00.320 --> 22:03.123
how excited I am to be joining
this community of...

22:04.124 --> 22:05.993
Well, fine minds.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.396
Hey!

22:09.429 --> 22:11.532
Hi! It went great!

22:11.565 --> 22:14.201
That's awesome, baby! Congratulations!

22:14.234 --> 22:15.736
Yeah, I mean, they really liked it

22:15.769 --> 22:17.705
and I met a few people.

22:17.738 --> 22:21.875
See? You focus on the present
tense, good things happen.

22:21.909 --> 22:25.813
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, sweetie. Bye.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.350
It's supposed to be really nice.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.169
Oh, my God, look! No glasses!

22:49.770 --> 22:51.839
Oh, my God!

22:51.872 --> 22:54.474
You actually look really, really
good without your glasses.

22:54.508 --> 22:58.445
- Thanks!
- But I mean, I like them on too.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.447
Just make sure you don't wear them
to Julie's end-of-the-summer party.

23:01.682 --> 23:03.283
Um, okay.

23:03.316 --> 23:05.986
- What're you gonna wear?
- I don't know.

23:06.019 --> 23:08.021
Not your Lion's T-shirt, I hope.

23:08.055 --> 23:10.157
You need to make those pajamas.

23:10.190 --> 23:12.159
Make those pajamas!

23:44.057 --> 23:45.793
Can I help you find something?

23:45.826 --> 23:47.928
No, just browsing.

23:48.762 --> 23:49.730
Browse away!

23:50.764 --> 23:52.232
You know, actually, yes.

23:53.066 --> 23:54.367
Contemporary fiction.

23:55.536 --> 23:56.904
- It's right this way.
- Okay.

23:59.507 --> 24:00.708
Are you looking for something
in particular?

24:00.741 --> 24:01.609
No, just...

24:02.710 --> 24:03.711
Just...

24:04.778 --> 24:07.280
Actually, Tenor Sax.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.650
Tenor Sax?

24:09.683 --> 24:10.851
By Marcus Burns.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.022
Definitely have never heard of it.

24:18.225 --> 24:20.093
- Okay. Thank you.
- But...

24:20.861 --> 24:22.495
I can order it.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.231
- No, that's okay. Thank you, though.
- Sure!

26:22.349 --> 26:24.852
Oh. Thank you, Mr. Hansen.

26:26.587 --> 26:27.521
Well?

26:28.889 --> 26:29.990
That was good.

26:32.593 --> 26:34.227
You know 2-BIT used to be a ho?

26:36.196 --> 26:37.865
Yeah, I knew... I knew that.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.501
She's rich now, I guess.

26:45.072 --> 26:47.508
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

26:47.541 --> 26:49.376
I can't believe it!

26:51.512 --> 26:54.882
She asked what we were doing, and I told
her that we were practicing our routine!

26:54.915 --> 26:56.917
She says I should never listen to 2-BIT

26:56.950 --> 26:59.520
and I can never dance in front of a boy!

26:59.553 --> 27:01.188
But you weren't doing anything wrong.

27:01.221 --> 27:03.190
Right? Clark?

27:05.959 --> 27:07.895
I hate my mom!

27:07.928 --> 27:09.062
Don't you guys hate yours?

27:10.263 --> 27:11.932
- I don't know.
- I guess.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.135
Mine's such a c-word!

27:29.316 --> 27:30.784
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom!

27:32.085 --> 27:34.221
Did you get new furniture?

27:34.254 --> 27:36.724
A few things. We'll figure it out.

27:36.757 --> 27:38.291
You didn't smoke, did you?

27:39.226 --> 27:41.595
No, sweetie, I didn't.

27:44.965 --> 27:46.266
What is this?

27:46.967 --> 27:48.101
Mind if I look?

27:53.607 --> 27:55.743
- Where did you get this?
- Julie's.

27:58.311 --> 28:00.748
- I don't like it.
- It's fine.

28:00.781 --> 28:03.083
Clark, it's not and you know it!

28:03.116 --> 28:04.351
Can't you read a book?

28:05.152 --> 28:06.286
I don't have my books.

28:07.454 --> 28:09.957
So then, let's go to the library.

28:17.831 --> 28:19.332
What?

28:19.366 --> 28:21.769
Can you go see what your son is reading?

28:21.802 --> 28:25.472
- Intro to sexism.
- What?

28:25.506 --> 28:30.811
He's reading some article called,
"The 2-BIT Slutty Don't Cut It."

28:32.946 --> 28:35.683
Uh... I'm sorry. It's just...

28:35.716 --> 28:37.651
It's more ridiculous than anything else.

28:37.685 --> 28:38.819
Just fix it, please!

28:44.191 --> 28:45.458
Come in.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.471
Mom want you to talk to me?

28:58.506 --> 28:59.507
Yes.

29:02.475 --> 29:05.045
But I'm just gonna sit
here for a minute.

29:06.714 --> 29:07.480
Shh.

29:09.216 --> 29:10.584
It's normal music, Dad.

29:10.851 --> 29:11.852
Okay.

29:12.653 --> 29:14.555
It's mainstream.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.957
I just want to add to your collection.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.392
- I don't have my collection.
- I know, I know.

29:19.426 --> 29:20.594
When it gets here.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.130
But listen to this.

29:23.163 --> 29:25.733
Ah!

29:25.766 --> 29:32.039
Do you want to learn how to make
saffron creme caramel from Somalia?

29:34.875 --> 29:37.277
Your job's weird.

29:38.612 --> 29:41.849
Yeah, I know. Listen to this.

29:44.451 --> 29:48.355
Mmm, got to love my man, Butch Morris.

30:10.944 --> 30:14.715
Oh, look at you! Oh, it looks great!

30:14.748 --> 30:17.350
Okay, picture time,
both of you, get together.

30:17.384 --> 30:20.554
Okay. One, two.

30:20.588 --> 30:24.525
Ooh! Ogie-Sogie.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.059
You're gonna have so much fun!

30:26.093 --> 30:28.562
- Okay. I'll be in the car.
- Okay.

30:28.596 --> 30:30.764
- All right. I'll see ya later.
- Bye.

30:39.306 --> 30:41.408
- You smell that?
- What?

30:42.910 --> 30:44.077
Smells like mold.

30:45.579 --> 30:47.114
Babe, I don't think we have mold.

30:47.147 --> 30:49.983
Yeah. It's mold.

30:50.017 --> 30:51.985
Okay, so let's call someone.

30:52.853 --> 30:56.456
Gina...

30:57.525 --> 30:58.959
- I love you.
- I love you.

31:06.934 --> 31:09.336
Oh. Hi, Clark!

31:09.369 --> 31:10.604
Dad, please take this.

31:11.772 --> 31:14.441
Hey, Brittany! Um... This is Clark.

31:14.474 --> 31:15.676
- Is that Clark?
- Yeah.

31:16.877 --> 31:19.747
Okay, then. Hi, girls. Mack Burns.

31:19.780 --> 31:21.949
Hi, I'm Joan Reid.
I'm Ambrosia's mother.

31:21.982 --> 31:23.116
Clark is my son.

31:23.150 --> 31:25.352
Mr. Burns, can Clark come with us?

31:25.385 --> 31:27.254
We're gonna just get
a book and then eat.

31:27.287 --> 31:29.590
Um... We'll drive him home, please?

31:29.623 --> 31:31.124
Okay, no need to beg, Ambrosia.

31:31.158 --> 31:32.459
Oh, I can drive everyone up.

31:32.492 --> 31:34.828
I plan on staying anyway
to keep an eye on Clark.

31:34.862 --> 31:36.664
Out of sight, of course.

31:36.697 --> 31:37.998
Thank you. That would be terrific.

31:38.031 --> 31:40.300
- And it's a very safe place. I assure you.
- Okay.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.635
- Yeah. All right, you good?
- Yeah.

31:41.669 --> 31:43.270
I'll see you later. Thank you, again.

31:43.303 --> 31:44.237
You're welcome.

31:55.883 --> 31:57.618
A new Megan episode approaches.

31:57.651 --> 31:58.819
I frickin' hate Nigel Fishponds.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.421
What?

32:02.389 --> 32:03.824
It's for children!

32:03.857 --> 32:07.360
It is not! Clark, you like it, right?

32:07.394 --> 32:11.565
Nigel Fishpond is feeling brilliant on
that foggy, soggy Yorkshire morning.

32:11.599 --> 32:13.501
Nigel was in the garden with his swan,

32:13.534 --> 32:15.202
happily planting hyacinths.

32:16.269 --> 32:18.238
I mean...

32:20.508 --> 32:21.441
Let's get the hell out of here.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.319
Please hold for a customer
service representative.

32:41.962 --> 32:43.764
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
we got my brother.

32:43.797 --> 32:45.432
Figures.

32:45.465 --> 32:48.035
He is such a tool.

32:48.068 --> 32:50.070
Welcome to The Sidecar.
May I take your order, please.

32:50.103 --> 32:52.840
Don't pretend like
you don't know us, Cooper.

32:52.873 --> 32:54.341
You, ma'am.

32:54.374 --> 32:56.109
Uh, double nachos, please.

32:57.444 --> 32:59.079
- Am I next, Cooper?
- Yeah.

33:00.714 --> 33:02.783
Oh, my God, the world is so racist.

33:04.217 --> 33:06.019
What?

33:06.053 --> 33:07.821
Why did you wait to take his order last?

33:09.590 --> 33:10.758
Because he's black?

33:13.761 --> 33:14.928
Just kidding, everybody!

33:29.843 --> 33:31.612
Hey, baby, how'd it go?

33:31.645 --> 33:33.146
It went fine.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.915
It ran a little later than I thought.

33:34.948 --> 33:36.817
Sorry, I missed dinner.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.952
It's no big deal.
Food in the fridge if you want.

33:46.159 --> 33:50.097
So there's just one session today,
at noon, and then I'm done.

33:50.130 --> 33:53.934
And I thought you might think
about your birthday dinner.

33:53.967 --> 33:55.669
Because you know, you always
do such a great feast,

33:55.703 --> 33:57.805
- and I can help you.
- I'm out.

33:58.939 --> 34:01.208
Hey, um... I hear you didn't get a book.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.476
Yeah.

34:03.511 --> 34:06.647
Do you want to walk into town with
Dad and get one and hang out?

34:07.781 --> 34:09.116
I don't want a book.

34:09.149 --> 34:12.152
The Gastro people have
been asking me for pages.

34:12.185 --> 34:14.187
Hey, Clark! Glasses!

34:14.221 --> 34:15.155
Bye, Clark!

34:17.123 --> 34:20.994
"I'm out"? Have you ever
heard him say that before?

34:21.027 --> 34:22.795
I don't know. What's wrong with it?

34:25.533 --> 34:26.734
Nothing...

34:45.553 --> 34:47.219
Every time he's hit, let's say,

34:47.254 --> 34:49.523
"Yo, Mommy! You gots to stick it."

34:49.556 --> 34:51.958
Yo, Mommy, you gots to stick it.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.165
Gina. Gina! Hang on.

34:59.567 --> 35:01.869
The doctor ladies would
love to meet you.

35:01.902 --> 35:02.970
Doctor ladies?

35:03.003 --> 35:05.673
Yes! We are the fun ones!

35:05.706 --> 35:06.540
- Oh, my!
- We have tenure,

35:06.574 --> 35:08.676
so we do whatever we want.

35:08.709 --> 35:11.812
The three of us make up the
faculty Deep Listening Committee.

35:11.845 --> 35:14.381
- So ridiculous!
- We loved your work.

35:14.414 --> 35:15.415
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.350
Thank you, thank you.

35:17.384 --> 35:19.219
Seriously, even though it's
like really New-York-centric,

35:19.252 --> 35:23.256
it has this universally
authentic feel! It's great!

35:23.290 --> 35:26.927
And the images did not reject
humor. They were funny.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.697
Okay, show-offs. We get it.

35:29.730 --> 35:33.834
No, I mean. Thank you so much.
That really means a lot.

35:33.867 --> 35:34.835
What are you doing right now?

35:34.868 --> 35:37.270
We are going to have a liquid lunch.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.606
- We usually get f'd up.
- Right.

35:39.773 --> 35:41.875
I... Gosh, I would love to,

35:41.909 --> 35:44.011
but I gotta get back to my kid. But...

35:44.044 --> 35:46.580
No? No, no. This is Committee work,

35:46.614 --> 35:48.448
I'm the Chair, Deep Listening, yes?

35:48.481 --> 35:50.183
- Come on!
- Yes.

35:50.217 --> 35:52.052
Please come! We'd really like
to hear more about your art.

35:53.887 --> 35:56.924
- Sure, great. Okay.
- Okay, wonderful!

36:30.490 --> 36:32.660
This is not happening.

36:57.885 --> 36:58.886
Hey, man.

37:00.721 --> 37:04.625
Hey, wow! This is so nice.

37:04.658 --> 37:06.794
Well, I thought I'd just order
the book for you,

37:06.827 --> 37:08.696
and then I saw your photo.

37:08.729 --> 37:10.698
And I realized,

37:10.731 --> 37:12.465
"Oh, he actually wrote the book!"

37:12.499 --> 37:14.535
And then I did a little more
research and I saw that you

37:14.568 --> 37:16.937
and your wife live here now,
which is really cool.

37:16.970 --> 37:18.839
Thanks, but I didn't mean
for you to do this.

37:18.872 --> 37:20.674
Oh, no! It's... It's my pleasure.

37:20.708 --> 37:21.809
Hey!

37:24.011 --> 37:25.779
I'm... I'm Steve, by the way.

37:25.813 --> 37:26.814
I'm Mack Burns.

37:27.648 --> 37:28.649
I know.

37:29.717 --> 37:31.384
Hey, we should do a reading!

37:31.418 --> 37:32.653
- Hey, there!
- No, we... We...

37:32.686 --> 37:34.988
What's going on, man? You got a day off?

37:35.022 --> 37:36.857
No, I'm... I'm writing.

37:39.392 --> 37:42.495
Hey, buddy. Is that... Is that you?

37:43.263 --> 37:44.565
Yes, that's me.

37:46.667 --> 37:47.568
You wrote a book?

37:48.936 --> 37:50.237
A while ago.

37:51.705 --> 37:54.241
Oh, man. Hey, look, look.
If you ever want to talk,

37:54.274 --> 37:58.178
like process, inspiration
versus perspiration...

37:58.211 --> 38:00.814
I'm... I'm a writer too.
I mean, I... I dabble.

38:00.848 --> 38:02.583
I'm not... I don't have a... But...

38:02.616 --> 38:06.386
You know, sometime that would be cool.

38:06.419 --> 38:08.188
Uh...

38:10.090 --> 38:13.026
If the opportunity
presented itself, then...

38:15.128 --> 38:16.196
Hey, I see my wife.

38:18.031 --> 38:20.701
So I'll, uh... I'll see you guys later.

38:20.734 --> 38:23.403
Oh, okay. All right. Uh...

38:23.436 --> 38:25.438
- See ya around the hood!
- Yes!

38:25.472 --> 38:27.040
You should invite her to the reading!

38:27.575 --> 38:28.576
Absolutely!

38:29.777 --> 38:32.580
- Hi, you!
- Oh, hey! Hi!

38:32.613 --> 38:34.748
I am just running into everybody today!

38:34.782 --> 38:37.250
Yeah, that's so funny! Um...

38:37.284 --> 38:38.952
Well, these are my colleagues.

38:38.986 --> 38:42.055
Uh... This is Sarita.
This is Helena. This is Maya.

38:42.089 --> 38:43.223
This is my husband, Mack!

38:43.256 --> 38:45.859
- Oh!
- Oh, hello! Nice to meet you!

38:45.893 --> 38:47.294
It's very nice to meet you all.

38:47.327 --> 38:49.229
- Oh.
- Come join us!

38:49.262 --> 38:51.865
- I thought you were working!
- I thought you were working.

38:51.899 --> 38:53.466
Oh, I am. This is a, um...

38:53.501 --> 38:57.037
This is like a work thing,
like the lunch-y situation.

38:57.070 --> 38:58.806
- Oh, okay, cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:58.839 --> 39:00.608
- Should we grab another chair?
- No. No, no, no.

39:00.641 --> 39:02.042
- Yeah, do you wanna...
- No, no.

39:02.075 --> 39:04.578
- I'm dealing with the house.
- Okay, are you sure?

39:04.612 --> 39:07.414
Yeah, yeah, it looks like
y'all have a lot to discuss.

39:07.447 --> 39:11.084
And give Gina some fine insight.

39:11.118 --> 39:12.920
I've got some insight for you too, Mack.

39:12.953 --> 39:16.056
- If you don't mind.
- Uh, sure.

39:16.089 --> 39:20.460
Well, as the husband of a tenure
track Assistant Professor,

39:20.493 --> 39:23.631
you should become accustomed
to your wife's marked absence.

39:23.664 --> 39:25.332
- Marked?
- Distinct.

39:26.634 --> 39:28.401
I know what it is.

39:28.435 --> 39:30.504
I'm sorry. I know. I...
I didn't mean to imply

39:30.538 --> 39:31.772
you didn't know what it meant.

39:31.805 --> 39:33.907
I think what she's trying to say

39:33.941 --> 39:36.577
is that the first year
can be really intense.

39:36.610 --> 39:38.846
- Okay.
- We're gonna help her get through it.

39:38.879 --> 39:40.581
- Absolutely.
- I'm sure you will.

39:40.614 --> 39:41.682
So you're sure you won't join us?

39:42.449 --> 39:43.584
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

39:43.617 --> 39:45.185
- I'll let you work.
- Gotta do stuff at the house.

39:45.218 --> 39:46.520
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

39:46.554 --> 39:47.721
Bye!

39:49.623 --> 39:51.124
Make sure you save
a plate for your mama.

39:52.125 --> 39:53.126
Yeah.

39:55.328 --> 39:58.465
So, what goes on at Julie's?

39:59.533 --> 40:01.635
- Nothing.
- Come on, Clark!

40:01.669 --> 40:03.170
You can tell me.

40:03.203 --> 40:05.673
Well, we watch stuff, grab ass.

40:05.706 --> 40:09.276
Grab ass?

40:09.309 --> 40:11.712
Did you just say, "grab ass"?

40:11.745 --> 40:13.647
My bad.

40:14.381 --> 40:16.316
"My bad"?

40:16.349 --> 40:18.185
It's sort of over as a phrase,
you know, right?

40:19.553 --> 40:21.522
- I mean, I'm just saying.
- I don't think it's over.

40:22.189 --> 40:24.525
It's over, Clark.

40:24.558 --> 40:27.294
I mean, it may not be
in these parts, but...

40:27.327 --> 40:28.195
May I be excused?

40:29.396 --> 40:30.163
Yes.

40:49.349 --> 40:51.519
Oh, God. What time is it?

40:55.222 --> 40:56.690
Hello?

40:56.724 --> 40:58.559
Mack Burns? It's Coast to Coast Movers.

40:58.592 --> 41:00.260
Oh, hey.

41:01.294 --> 41:04.765
It's the truck. They called before.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.233
Why didn't you tell me?

41:07.100 --> 41:08.602
Hello?

41:08.636 --> 41:10.003
There is no need to keep calling.

41:10.037 --> 41:11.539
We are back on the road now.

41:11.572 --> 41:14.708
Oh, but, it never tells me
where you are, man.

41:14.742 --> 41:16.076
Not my problem, man.

41:16.109 --> 41:17.578
I'm sorry, what?

41:17.611 --> 41:20.047
Complaining to my supervisor
does not speed things up.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.414
And it's also not polite.

41:21.448 --> 41:25.252
Listen, bubba, this is
no longer about politeness.

41:25.285 --> 41:27.555
You have everything we own right now.

41:27.588 --> 41:29.189
We just want to get our shit back.

41:29.222 --> 41:31.224
Is that too much to ask?

41:31.258 --> 41:33.460
And now you curse.
I don't have to take this.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.195
Well, I'm gonna curse again, asshole.

41:38.498 --> 41:41.735
Do you want your stuff...

41:41.769 --> 41:46.073
You want your jazz collection,
$800 espresso machine?

41:47.575 --> 41:48.308
Shit.

41:51.845 --> 41:54.715
Now I'm not going to be
able to go back to sleep.

41:54.748 --> 41:57.951
And I have a huge work day tomorrow.

41:57.985 --> 41:59.019
All you have to do is show up.

41:59.620 --> 42:01.388
Oh, great.

42:01.421 --> 42:04.658
While I'm writing crap
that you don't even care about

42:05.693 --> 42:06.960
in a moldy,

42:08.829 --> 42:11.298
moldy-ass house.

42:11.331 --> 42:13.466
Okay, let's just try to sleep, okay?

42:13.501 --> 42:15.368
Yeah. My bad.

42:37.490 --> 42:38.559
Hi!

42:41.895 --> 42:43.363
You scared the shit out of me.

42:44.397 --> 42:45.332
I brought you a welcome present.

42:45.999 --> 42:47.535
Oh, wow.

42:47.568 --> 42:49.302
That's nice of you.

42:49.336 --> 42:52.339
It's actually my favorite tequila.

42:53.974 --> 42:55.876
I've got Stilton and crackers.

42:55.909 --> 42:57.110
That sound good?

42:57.144 --> 42:58.646
Sounds great! Thanks!

43:01.481 --> 43:02.816
You want to crack that open?

43:04.317 --> 43:05.318
Yeah.

43:15.028 --> 43:18.131
It's actually nice to hang out with
somebody other than my family.

43:18.165 --> 43:20.033
You're telling me.

43:20.768 --> 43:21.769
Hey, um...

43:23.070 --> 43:24.672
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to hang out

43:24.705 --> 43:27.007
with, uh, these too?

43:27.040 --> 43:28.676
What's that?

43:28.709 --> 43:31.545
Around here, we call them pharmies.

43:31.579 --> 43:33.814
- They're not like methy or oxy...
- No, no.

43:33.847 --> 43:35.883
- But just stuff you get from a doctor.
- No, no, no.

43:35.916 --> 43:38.519
I'm too... I'm too old
to be doing all that.

43:38.552 --> 43:41.522
Well, okay, yeah, I hear ya, man.

43:41.555 --> 43:43.023
But you know, small town living

43:44.224 --> 43:45.893
sometimes it could use a little boost.

43:57.871 --> 43:58.772
Cheers!

44:02.776 --> 44:05.345
- Oh, yeah.
- What's... Okay.

44:05.378 --> 44:07.347
Yes, you, you, you, you.

44:07.380 --> 44:10.518
- Thank you.
- Do you guys always, uh,

44:10.551 --> 44:13.020
- work this way?
- It breaks up the monotony.

44:13.053 --> 44:14.555
Yeah. Here's to you.

44:14.588 --> 44:17.791
Ah. Yes!

44:17.825 --> 44:20.427
Yeah, these short-term
committees are the worst!

44:20.460 --> 44:22.696
Oh, and now she is torturing us

44:22.730 --> 44:25.065
with three consecutive days of crap,

44:25.098 --> 44:27.535
like right before the students arrive

44:27.568 --> 44:29.136
I hope your family's okay with all this.

44:31.071 --> 44:34.074
Yeah, they're... They're great!
They're fine! Yeah.

44:34.107 --> 44:37.044
If I had a dime for every tenure
turned divorce in this town.

44:37.077 --> 44:38.278
Ah, you'd still be poor.

44:38.311 --> 44:40.948
Yes, but I'd have some dimes.

44:40.981 --> 44:43.083
I'd have some dimes in case
pay phones make a comeback.

44:45.586 --> 44:47.755
Oh, man, I'm so glad I met you!

44:48.856 --> 44:50.290
A fellow scribe?

44:50.958 --> 44:52.993
Hey! To scribes!

44:54.595 --> 44:56.730
If I don't get book number two out soon,

44:56.764 --> 44:59.199
I don't know but I'm gonna be
just a man with an agent.

45:00.501 --> 45:02.269
- You have an agent?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:02.302 --> 45:03.937
I thought I'd made it.

45:05.773 --> 45:07.307
Until I found out I didn't.

45:07.340 --> 45:10.611
But hey, thank God for advances.

45:11.679 --> 45:12.546
Yeah.

45:16.183 --> 45:17.317
What do you do?

45:17.851 --> 45:19.186
Oh, um...

45:21.221 --> 45:22.623
Erotic thrillers.

45:23.524 --> 45:26.527
I e-publish. They're very sexy.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.328
But very high-class.

45:29.396 --> 45:31.464
Erotic um...

45:31.498 --> 45:36.169
I'm writing an ass chapter
right now, all about asses.

45:36.904 --> 45:37.671
You're into it.

45:39.707 --> 45:40.908
Hey, everybody!

45:42.676 --> 45:44.645
This is my new buddy.

45:45.312 --> 45:46.547
His name is Mack.

45:47.047 --> 45:48.882
He's from New York!

45:48.916 --> 45:50.718
His wife is a professor!

45:51.318 --> 45:53.286
He is a writer!

45:53.320 --> 45:55.989
And he's going to write his
new book right here in Rome!

45:56.690 --> 45:57.691
To Mike!

45:58.826 --> 46:01.695
I'm humbled. Thank you.

46:01.729 --> 46:03.363
And the thing about this guy is,

46:03.396 --> 46:07.467
if you close your eyes, you can't
even tell he's black, you know?

46:07.501 --> 46:11.505
I mean, in a good way.
He's just very impressive.

46:41.802 --> 46:42.803
Come on.

47:27.014 --> 47:29.750
- Dad! I'm home!
- Yeah, Clarky.

47:31.952 --> 47:32.853
I'm cooking.

47:34.688 --> 47:35.689
Mom's not home, right?

47:36.690 --> 47:37.791
No.

47:39.092 --> 47:40.961
Can I do a few games on your phone?

47:40.994 --> 47:42.763
Yes, that's fine.

48:11.224 --> 48:15.929
♪ Oh I want the truth to be said ♪

48:15.963 --> 48:17.831
Sorry, that's not the bit

49:39.747 --> 49:40.948
Hi!

49:40.981 --> 49:42.215
Hi. This is like...

49:42.249 --> 49:43.250
You okay?

49:44.051 --> 49:46.119
Oh, yes.

49:46.153 --> 49:48.789
You just gotta learn to
pace yourself a little better.

49:48.822 --> 49:50.924
I think I just didn't really realize

49:50.958 --> 49:52.593
that this job was like

49:53.794 --> 49:55.796
a license to imbibe.

49:55.829 --> 49:57.130
Oh, yeah.

49:57.164 --> 49:59.432
You know, you have
a really good singing voice.

50:01.101 --> 50:02.269
No, no!

50:02.302 --> 50:03.837
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, I don't.

50:05.305 --> 50:06.607
It's li...

50:06.640 --> 50:10.978
I have a friend in New York
who's like an actual

50:11.011 --> 50:12.946
Broadway singer, like professional,

50:12.980 --> 50:15.115
and she is amazing! She's like...

50:15.683 --> 50:16.684
Mmm-hmm.

50:17.951 --> 50:20.821
Agh! My New York friends
are so talented.

50:22.956 --> 50:24.391
Well, hooray for them!

50:27.595 --> 50:28.829
All right, heavy door.

50:28.862 --> 50:30.564
- I'm...
- Heavy door.

50:30.598 --> 50:31.932
I'm very sorry.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.968
She got it. She just grabbed it.

50:35.002 --> 50:36.169
Watch your step.

50:36.203 --> 50:38.471
I'll watch.

50:39.773 --> 50:41.408
- You guys, good?
- We'll be right behind you.

50:41.441 --> 50:42.976
Thank you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

50:43.010 --> 50:44.745
- I've been there. No worries.
- It's okay!

50:44.778 --> 50:46.313
I'm sorry, you have to drive my car.

50:46.346 --> 50:48.582
There's stuff in the passenger seat.

50:48.616 --> 50:49.950
I know. Just uh... Just move it.

50:49.983 --> 50:52.520
Oh, God, I have not
been like this for years!

50:53.687 --> 50:55.355
You know what? It's fine.

50:55.388 --> 50:57.825
But I have to tell you, getting
sloppy is embarrassing.

50:57.858 --> 50:59.527
This is a very small town.

51:01.695 --> 51:03.697
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

51:03.731 --> 51:05.766
- I'm sorry.
- Put your seatbelt on, please.

51:05.799 --> 51:07.635
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Yes.

52:35.088 --> 52:36.056
Mack!

52:36.724 --> 52:40.761
Stop! What?

52:42.596 --> 52:44.097
What is wrong with you?

52:44.131 --> 52:46.099
Look what you did! Look!

52:48.902 --> 52:50.671
Oh, God, what is that?

52:52.172 --> 52:53.273
I told you.

52:53.807 --> 52:55.909
It's mold!

52:55.943 --> 52:58.378
But you forgot, because
you haven't been here.

52:58.411 --> 53:00.814
I have been working! Okay.

53:02.115 --> 53:03.316
You're drunk!

53:03.350 --> 53:04.918
So are you!

53:05.653 --> 53:07.054
Oh, God, oh, God.

53:07.087 --> 53:08.656
It's just mold, Clarky.

53:08.689 --> 53:10.624
- Everything's all right.
- Everything's not all right!

53:10.658 --> 53:11.992
Go to your room, Clark.

53:12.025 --> 53:13.994
Daddy just got angry.
He... he's all right.

53:14.027 --> 53:15.929
Go to your room, Clark!

53:19.332 --> 53:20.100
What did he do?

53:29.342 --> 53:31.178
- Hi.
- What the hell happened?

53:33.013 --> 53:34.214
It's over now.

53:37.851 --> 53:40.754
Your dad got upset
because there was mold,

53:40.788 --> 53:43.323
and we just had a little fight about it.

53:43.891 --> 53:44.958
But...

53:49.630 --> 53:50.631
What is that?

53:55.002 --> 53:56.003
Agh!

53:58.238 --> 53:59.306
Wait, don't!

53:59.339 --> 54:01.609
This is not how I want you
to understand women.

54:01.642 --> 54:03.143
- Mom, give it back!
- No, I won't give it back.

54:03.176 --> 54:04.678
- Yes!
- No!

54:04.712 --> 54:05.913
Shit! You ruin everything.

54:11.384 --> 54:12.653
Don't swear!

54:15.155 --> 54:16.156
Fuck!

54:41.348 --> 54:43.884
Are we going to say anything
to each other today?

54:46.419 --> 54:48.421
I'm waiting for the mold guy.

54:53.260 --> 54:55.095
What's happening
for your birthday tonight?

54:55.128 --> 54:56.129
Nothing.

54:59.099 --> 55:01.702
Did you call Vizey,
about William coming?

55:01.735 --> 55:02.736
No.

55:08.709 --> 55:09.843
Well, that's sad.

55:09.877 --> 55:12.112
Well, I don't have a kitchen.

55:14.648 --> 55:15.649
I'm going to Julie's.

55:39.339 --> 55:41.474
Signed editions, 'cause
I want to put those out.

55:41.509 --> 55:44.311
Okay, I have to go, bye. Hello!

55:45.312 --> 55:47.214
Uh, yeah, hi. Um...

55:47.247 --> 55:48.248
Do you have

55:48.849 --> 55:51.118
any more of the, the Nigel?

55:51.451 --> 55:53.253
Oh, no.

55:53.286 --> 55:55.288
We're completely sold out.
So is Big Mart.

55:55.322 --> 55:56.957
They went so fast! Everything just...

55:56.990 --> 55:57.991
My son is having a...

55:58.759 --> 56:00.293
Really hard time.

56:00.327 --> 56:02.262
And I would really love it,

56:02.295 --> 56:05.098
it would be great
if I could get him uh...

56:05.132 --> 56:06.399
- One of the Nigel's.
- The Nigel's.

56:06.433 --> 56:08.569
No, I completely get it. But we...

56:08.602 --> 56:11.438
- We just don't have any.
- Can you look in the back?

56:11.471 --> 56:14.007
I did a full inventory
right before I had my coffee.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.143
I don't care if you had your coffee,

56:16.176 --> 56:18.111
okay? That's irrelevant.

56:18.946 --> 56:20.614
Okay. I understand.

56:21.849 --> 56:22.950
I'm sorry.

56:22.983 --> 56:25.118
It's okay, it's okay. Um...

56:26.119 --> 56:27.755
Look,

56:27.788 --> 56:29.156
I heard that they have books
in Wenatchee,

56:29.189 --> 56:30.958
so you might want to try there.

56:30.991 --> 56:33.060
- Thank you. Okay.
- Good luck.

56:47.474 --> 56:50.310
Call Vizey Burns Steiner, mobile.

57:07.227 --> 57:09.329
Ohhh! So chilly.

57:11.532 --> 57:13.366
Is this okay with Julie?

57:14.001 --> 57:15.168
Yeah.

57:15.202 --> 57:16.870
I mean, I don't know.

57:16.904 --> 57:18.672
But I don't care.

57:19.773 --> 57:21.809
What did you say to her?

57:21.842 --> 57:23.443
That we don't have to do
everything together.

57:27.247 --> 57:28.448
I made these for us.

57:29.683 --> 57:31.552
- What is it?
- Grown-up drinks.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.221
Watch this.

57:59.780 --> 58:02.249
Really?

58:02.282 --> 58:03.951
Yeah, I know, it's kind of stupid.

58:09.156 --> 58:11.391
- Do you feel anything?
- I don't feel anything.

58:13.060 --> 58:14.061
Maybe a little.

58:22.102 --> 58:24.705
Oh, shit!

58:24.738 --> 58:25.739
I should change.

58:27.841 --> 58:28.842
Want to watch me?

58:30.010 --> 58:31.912
Um... Yeah.

58:34.181 --> 58:36.817
Okay. You go behind the curtain.

58:40.087 --> 58:42.122
Um... You guys?

58:44.692 --> 58:45.926
You guys!

58:47.160 --> 58:48.662
Okay,

58:48.696 --> 58:49.663
here's the performance.

58:59.106 --> 59:01.041
Whooo!

59:07.881 --> 59:09.282
Whooo!

59:16.323 --> 59:17.324
Oh.

59:19.793 --> 59:21.261
This is for you.

59:21.294 --> 59:23.196
Yo, Mommy, you gots to stick it.

59:23.230 --> 59:25.398
Yo, Mommy, you gots to stick it.

59:30.704 --> 59:31.471
Hello!

59:33.741 --> 59:35.776
Hey, sweetie. Is Ambrosia ready?

59:35.809 --> 59:37.410
Um... Not yet.

59:38.679 --> 59:40.848
She and Clark
shut themselves in my room.

59:42.683 --> 59:43.584
Excuse me?

59:51.258 --> 59:52.760
Rawr!

59:57.497 --> 59:59.066
What in God's name is happening here?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.069
Nothing. Sorry.

01:00:08.776 --> 01:00:10.678
Hello! Look who's here!

01:00:10.711 --> 01:00:12.145
Hey, what's up, everybody?

01:00:12.179 --> 01:00:13.514
What? How're you here?

01:00:13.547 --> 01:00:15.182
What's up, Uncle Mack? Happy birthday!

01:00:15.215 --> 01:00:17.017
- Thank you!
- How you been?

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.218
- I've been good. How you?
- Well, good.

01:00:18.251 --> 01:00:20.087
I'm all right. What's up, Clark?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.823
Surprise!

01:00:22.856 --> 01:00:24.925
Thought it was worth the drive to um...

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.061
Surprise you guys.

01:00:28.095 --> 01:00:29.697
Um... What's wrong?

01:00:30.798 --> 01:00:32.232
Um... If there's a problem,

01:00:32.265 --> 01:00:34.668
I could step outside real fast.

01:00:34.702 --> 01:00:36.369
Actually, William, Clark's
bedroom is right upstairs.

01:00:36.403 --> 01:00:38.405
Can you go up, please?

01:00:38.438 --> 01:00:40.741
- No problem.
- Thank you.

01:00:40.774 --> 01:00:43.143
- Thank you. See ya in a minute.
- All right.

01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:50.117
I was behind her curtains,
so we wouldn't see each other.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.451
It was an accident.

01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:57.925
Grabbing at a girl's naked torso

01:00:57.958 --> 01:00:59.760
is something, Clark.

01:00:59.793 --> 01:01:01.228
You're too young.

01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:02.395
I didn't mean it!

01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:06.399
A physical relationship

01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:08.602
is to be considered very carefully.

01:01:10.303 --> 01:01:11.304
Well, sorry!

01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:15.609
You know, I have to say

01:01:15.643 --> 01:01:18.145
I am not sure she's the
right friend for you anyway.

01:01:18.178 --> 01:01:19.980
You've never even met her.

01:01:20.013 --> 01:01:23.751
Well, think about the girls
that you knew in New York.

01:01:23.784 --> 01:01:25.786
Would any of them behave that way?

01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:27.120
I can think of a few.

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:31.491
Okay.

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:32.526
It's hard, you know?

01:01:33.927 --> 01:01:38.298
Ambrosia's family
is probably struggling.

01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:42.135
And they probably don't have the same
background or education that we do.

01:01:42.169 --> 01:01:43.270
So...

01:01:43.303 --> 01:01:44.337
Are you calling them dumb?

01:01:45.539 --> 01:01:47.775
It's about access and opportunities.

01:01:47.808 --> 01:01:50.443
You sure you want to go there, G?

01:01:50.477 --> 01:01:54.014
All I'm saying is
that Ambrosia's parents

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:56.984
may not be able to help her
make the greatest choices.

01:01:57.618 --> 01:01:58.619
Like smoking?

01:01:59.186 --> 01:02:01.755
That's a terrible choice!

01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:05.458
That's not entirely fair,
Cl... I'm really trying.

01:02:05.492 --> 01:02:06.994
But he does have a point, baby.

01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:08.061
Thank you.

01:02:08.862 --> 01:02:10.531
Mack, thanks a lot.

01:02:11.565 --> 01:02:13.433
No party at Julie's.

01:02:13.466 --> 01:02:15.335
That's not fair! This is my first party.

01:02:18.005 --> 01:02:18.739
That's it!

01:02:24.344 --> 01:02:26.279
Here, I did get you this.

01:02:26.313 --> 01:02:27.981
They had plenty in Seattle.

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.382
So.

01:02:30.217 --> 01:02:31.218
Oh.

01:02:34.755 --> 01:02:35.756
Okay.

01:02:38.158 --> 01:02:40.661
You really want to call me
classist right in front of him?

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:46.534
We can eat at any time.

01:02:49.402 --> 01:02:50.871
- Did you cook?
- Take-out.

01:02:53.674 --> 01:02:55.342
Dude, so what happened?

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:56.744
I got caught with a girl.

01:02:56.777 --> 01:02:58.345
- Your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

01:02:58.378 --> 01:02:59.913
They got black people here?

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:00.714
She's white.

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.216
Another black man succumbs.

01:03:04.051 --> 01:03:06.353
So am I gonna meet her?

01:03:06.386 --> 01:03:08.556
There's a party tomorrow,
but I'm not allowed to go.

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:11.759
You know, you still could go.

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:13.927
Especially if it's the whole
Romeo and Juliet thing.

01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:15.095
Then you have to go!

01:03:16.764 --> 01:03:18.265
Look, man,

01:03:18.298 --> 01:03:20.534
chicks, they dig intrigue.

01:03:20.568 --> 01:03:22.636
If it's boring, they out.

01:03:23.571 --> 01:03:25.272
Boys! Let's eat!

01:03:26.807 --> 01:03:28.776
But you won't do that, right,
Clark Kent?

01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:29.577
You're too good.

01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:36.216
So should we say grace?

01:03:38.151 --> 01:03:40.420
That would be lovely, William. Yeah.

01:03:40.453 --> 01:03:41.955
Nobody here believes in God.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:43.090
Enough, Clark.

01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:49.196
Heavenly Father,
thank you for this food,

01:03:49.229 --> 01:03:51.298
for the superiority of the West Coast,

01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:53.266
and for this lovely family,

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.202
that always does right by one another.

01:03:55.235 --> 01:03:56.770
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:04:03.476 --> 01:04:04.912
Happy birthday.

01:04:05.946 --> 01:04:06.947
Thank you.

01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:16.957
Hello, boys!

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:18.258
- What's up?
- Hi.

01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:19.627
- Welcome in.
- Thank you!

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.702
Hey, dude, where is she?

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.004
Think she's ignoring you?

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:32.873
Maybe she's feeling shy or mad?

01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:35.142
No, I just don't see her yet.

01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:38.646
Nah, she ignoring you.

01:04:38.679 --> 01:04:40.848
I know this may sound counterintuitive,

01:04:40.881 --> 01:04:42.315
but you got to ignore her
even meaner or harder

01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:43.684
than she's ignoring you.

01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:44.818
Really?

01:04:44.852 --> 01:04:46.219
Yeah, they go nutty for it.

01:04:48.321 --> 01:04:50.190
Wow, son, you were right.

01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:51.291
It is white out here.

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:56.229
- Hey, Clark.
- What's up?

01:04:58.198 --> 01:05:00.100
Who's your friend?

01:05:00.133 --> 01:05:01.368
- I'm William.
- None of your business.

01:05:02.002 --> 01:05:02.736
Let's go.

01:05:05.405 --> 01:05:06.206
Dude, what are you doing?

01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:07.675
Looking for Ambrosia.

01:05:13.747 --> 01:05:14.748
Clarky!

01:05:19.853 --> 01:05:20.854
Clark?

01:05:27.695 --> 01:05:30.297
Hey, yo! What's up?

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:31.498
Stop! I don't want to look at her,

01:05:31.532 --> 01:05:33.466
because she might look at me.

01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:34.868
Dude, what you talking about?

01:05:34.902 --> 01:05:36.737
Why you acting so crazy
and nervous today?

01:05:38.572 --> 01:05:39.740
Acting cool, she's coming.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.343
Hey, I thought you might be grounded.

01:05:44.745 --> 01:05:46.880
Uh... Hey.

01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:48.181
I don't think we've been
formally introduced.

01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:51.384
Uh... Hi.

01:05:51.418 --> 01:05:53.020
I'm William, Clark's cousin.

01:05:54.955 --> 01:05:56.323
Clark,

01:05:56.356 --> 01:05:57.124
what's wrong with you?

01:05:58.358 --> 01:05:59.693
Why aren't you talking to me?

01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:01.929
Dude, you gonna say something?

01:06:01.962 --> 01:06:03.396
- Clark!
- Mom!

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:04.464
Awww.

01:06:09.102 --> 01:06:13.240
Wow, guys, so, uh...
Here we are at the pool party.

01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:16.076
Honestly, it's my fault, Aunt Gina.

01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:17.611
I just wanted to meet Ambrosia.

01:06:19.146 --> 01:06:19.913
Oh.

01:06:21.882 --> 01:06:22.883
Hi, um...

01:06:23.717 --> 01:06:24.752
You're Ambrosia.

01:06:24.785 --> 01:06:26.687
Okay. I've been wanting to meet you.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.155
I'm Clark's mom, Gina.

01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:31.925
What?

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:33.994
Ambrosia!

01:06:35.796 --> 01:06:37.531
What's going on, you all right?

01:06:37.565 --> 01:06:38.932
You know how love is.

01:06:46.774 --> 01:06:49.242
Ambrosia, I didn't mean to ignore you.

01:06:49.276 --> 01:06:50.277
That was so dumb.

01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:53.814
Why didn't you tell me?

01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:55.148
Tell you what?

01:06:57.317 --> 01:06:58.485
Your mom is white!

01:07:00.153 --> 01:07:01.922
I had already told people about...

01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:05.893
You're not even...

01:07:05.926 --> 01:07:07.961
You acted like you were...

01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:09.697
You lied!

01:07:11.264 --> 01:07:12.465
Clark.

01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:16.570
Hey, stop!

01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:18.672
Ambrosia hates me now! Because of you!

01:07:18.706 --> 01:07:20.674
Clark, please!

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.843
It's your fault! Just leave me alone!

01:07:24.277 --> 01:07:25.012
Clark!

01:07:40.193 --> 01:07:42.029
- Can we talk about this?
- No!

01:07:43.496 --> 01:07:45.966
G, I got this. Okay?

01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:52.472
You all right, Aunt Gina?

01:07:52.506 --> 01:07:54.975
Oh, yeah. I'm okay.

01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:57.511
I just got the timing wrong.

01:07:58.512 --> 01:08:00.681
But I get it.

01:08:00.714 --> 01:08:02.950
You know I get it, right?

01:08:02.983 --> 01:08:05.185
Yeah, it'll be all right.
Y'all'll work it out.

01:08:06.486 --> 01:08:09.489
Oh, okay. Let's get you to your bus.

01:08:12.225 --> 01:08:13.594
I don't like white people!

01:08:14.695 --> 01:08:15.796
There are good white people.

01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:17.397
- Maybe in New York.
- Your mother!

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:20.033
- Not here!
- That's a generalization.

01:08:20.067 --> 01:08:21.702
People generalize about me.

01:08:21.734 --> 01:08:23.703
It doesn't matter, Clarky.

01:08:23.737 --> 01:08:26.707
You can't treat people
like they're groups.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.376
You have to treat people
like they're individuals.

01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:31.011
We've talked about this.

01:08:31.044 --> 01:08:32.345
I know we talked about this,
over and over!

01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:34.314
And we're gonna talk about it
over and over and over again.

01:08:34.346 --> 01:08:35.616
That's not the way it actually works!

01:10:11.645 --> 01:10:13.881
Oh, my God! Wait here, wait here!

01:10:22.523 --> 01:10:24.625
Oh, oh, ow!

01:10:24.658 --> 01:10:26.126
Mom what happened?

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:28.829
Oh, oh. Be careful, there's glass.
There's lots of glass here.

01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:52.986
Hi, Joan.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.021
What's the matter?

01:10:54.722 --> 01:10:55.488
You want to come in?

01:11:03.363 --> 01:11:04.097
What happened?

01:11:06.399 --> 01:11:09.469
Mr. Burns, last night your son

01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:11.071
put a huge rock

01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:13.674
through my front window.
It sliced my foot.

01:11:13.707 --> 01:11:16.309
He hasn't left here. He's asleep.

01:11:16.343 --> 01:11:18.712
I don't believe he's asleep, Mr. Burns.

01:11:18.746 --> 01:11:21.815
Okay, just... Um...

01:11:21.849 --> 01:11:23.517
Clark, we need you right now.

01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:24.384
You saw him?

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:26.386
I did.

01:11:26.419 --> 01:11:29.523
He has never done anything
like this ever in his life.

01:11:39.533 --> 01:11:41.434
Clark,

01:11:41.468 --> 01:11:43.671
Mrs. Reid says you put
a rock through her window.

01:11:43.704 --> 01:11:45.238
Shattered it.

01:11:45.272 --> 01:11:47.541
And it'll be at least $200 to replace.

01:11:47.575 --> 01:11:48.441
Is this true?

01:11:49.276 --> 01:11:50.343
No.

01:11:50.377 --> 01:11:52.012
Clarky.

01:11:52.045 --> 01:11:54.347
No. I was in bed, Dad.

01:11:54.381 --> 01:11:55.749
I believe that's a lie right there!

01:11:55.783 --> 01:11:56.950
- Wait a minute.
- That is a lie!

01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.386
Let's be reasonable here.

01:12:00.788 --> 01:12:01.789
Clark,

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:04.792
just look at me, okay.

01:12:04.825 --> 01:12:06.293
You can tell us. Did you do this?

01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:09.196
No.

01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:10.430
I saw him!

01:12:10.463 --> 01:12:11.699
You saw him?

01:12:11.732 --> 01:12:12.733
Wasn't it dark?

01:12:13.734 --> 01:12:15.268
Or is it just

01:12:15.302 --> 01:12:18.305
easy to imagine that he did it?

01:12:18.338 --> 01:12:21.642
Okay, I think, Clark, I think you
should wait upstairs. Just...

01:12:25.646 --> 01:12:28.248
Mr. Burns, I think
you find me to be ignorant.

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:32.753
I think you find me to be a racist.

01:12:32.786 --> 01:12:33.921
I didn't say that, Joan.

01:12:33.954 --> 01:12:35.222
You think I assume
your son is delinquent

01:12:35.255 --> 01:12:36.590
because he's African American?

01:12:36.624 --> 01:12:37.958
Um... Yes.

01:12:37.991 --> 01:12:40.160
I found him practically naked
with my daughter,

01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:42.495
and now he destroyed my property!

01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.064
I think that's a good reason
to call the police!

01:12:44.097 --> 01:12:46.299
- Which I plan to do!
- Are you crazy?

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:47.835
Is something wrong with you?

01:12:47.868 --> 01:12:49.169
He's an 11-year-old child.

01:12:49.202 --> 01:12:52.272
You want to call
the police on him? For what?

01:12:52.305 --> 01:12:55.075
- Okay.
- Are you trying to ruin my son's life?

01:12:55.108 --> 01:12:56.744
Okay, I think we should just stop.

01:12:56.777 --> 01:12:58.211
Just stop.

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:01.949
Should we have some coffee?
Can you come in?

01:13:02.816 --> 01:13:04.752
No, I will not come in.

01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:06.019
No, let her go.

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.159
You know I have credit towards
a master's degree,

01:13:12.192 --> 01:13:14.628
and I raised two children by myself!

01:13:14.662 --> 01:13:16.463
- We did, we did not mean...
- Uh... Just stop!

01:13:30.377 --> 01:13:31.712
You can't do that.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.615
What did I do?

01:13:34.648 --> 01:13:37.184
This is our new community.

01:13:37.217 --> 01:13:39.720
Y-you have to engage. Just try.

01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:42.189
Oh, I'm trying.

01:13:42.222 --> 01:13:45.859
By destroying our kitchen?
By making strangers cry?

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:47.961
Did you not just witness what happened?

01:13:47.995 --> 01:13:50.197
She profiled our son.

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:52.065
He didn't break her window.

01:13:52.099 --> 01:13:53.801
And then she was
about to call the police!

01:13:53.834 --> 01:13:55.569
We don't know

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:57.204
if he broke the window.

01:13:57.237 --> 01:13:59.907
And she, she didn't call the police.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.009
There's no need to malign her.

01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:03.544
Her!

01:14:03.577 --> 01:14:06.013
Not everyone is a racist, Mack!

01:14:08.716 --> 01:14:10.217
Where have you been, Gina?

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.920
Oh, that's how you think I see things?

01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:15.388
- I... I see the gray, okay.
- I'll tell you, how I think you see things.

01:14:15.422 --> 01:14:16.724
I'm not an idiot.

01:14:16.757 --> 01:14:19.392
Pretty much whatever concerns you!

01:14:19.426 --> 01:14:21.595
- You know...
- And if it makes you look bad...

01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:23.396
- It's not that easy!
- What's not that easy, Gina?

01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:26.667
Being the very pale third
wheel between the two of you.

01:14:31.605 --> 01:14:33.273
You try going through our bullshit.

01:14:35.876 --> 01:14:37.444
Absolutely alone.

01:14:38.946 --> 01:14:40.113
Alone?

01:14:40.147 --> 01:14:41.882
Yes!

01:14:41.915 --> 01:14:43.150
Are you kidding me?

01:14:46.554 --> 01:14:47.287
Fuck.

01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:51.391
Mold removal.

01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:06.239
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing us up.

01:15:06.273 --> 01:15:09.309
- Where are we going?
- C'mon! C'mon!

01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:13.714
You all about ready for me, then?

01:15:13.747 --> 01:15:15.148
I'm sorry, yes.
Can you start in the kitchen?

01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:16.316
Clark, throw your stuff in here.

01:15:16.349 --> 01:15:17.384
Where the hell are we going, Gina?

01:15:17.417 --> 01:15:18.418
Gina! Where we going?

01:15:24.457 --> 01:15:25.659
You sure that you want to
drive on the highway?

01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:27.595
Yep.

01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:31.398
Gina?

01:15:31.431 --> 01:15:32.465
Yeah.

01:15:32.499 --> 01:15:33.834
You're driving really, really fast.

01:15:33.867 --> 01:15:35.302
Well, I'm in a big rush.

01:15:36.436 --> 01:15:37.905
Where are we going?

01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:39.640
We're going to New York.

01:15:40.307 --> 01:15:41.542
Baby, come on!

01:15:48.381 --> 01:15:50.317
I should never have done this.

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:53.120
I should, I should never have
brought us all here.

01:15:54.555 --> 01:15:58.125
I just... I'm...

01:15:59.026 --> 01:16:00.360
I shouldn't have.

01:16:00.894 --> 01:16:03.631
It was such a mistake!

01:16:03.664 --> 01:16:06.967
I ruined everything!
I ruined everything forever.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.603
Gina, you didn't ruin anything.

01:16:09.637 --> 01:16:10.971
And this is not forever.

01:16:11.004 --> 01:16:12.405
This is just a chapter.

01:16:16.043 --> 01:16:18.411
Now, please, pull over!

01:16:21.014 --> 01:16:22.516
Come on, baby!

01:16:36.163 --> 01:16:38.231
I broke the window.

01:16:38.265 --> 01:16:40.400
- What?
- What?

01:16:40.433 --> 01:16:44.204
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I was mad.

01:17:26.479 --> 01:17:27.480
What the hell?

01:17:30.383 --> 01:17:31.384
Oh, my God.

01:17:35.255 --> 01:17:37.457
You call and call and call.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:39.627
I come, and I cannot access
the interior.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.730
- So I unload it.
- But it, it needs to go inside.

01:17:42.763 --> 01:17:43.897
That's it.

01:17:43.931 --> 01:17:44.832
I'm done with this family.

01:17:45.599 --> 01:17:47.034
You are bad people.

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:49.002
- What?
- Can he do that?

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.438
I guess, I mean...

01:17:51.471 --> 01:17:52.640
He did it.

01:17:55.308 --> 01:17:56.544
We're not bad people.

01:17:56.577 --> 01:17:58.245
I said we're not bad people!

01:17:58.278 --> 01:17:59.613
We're not bad people!

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:09.890
Are you okay?

01:18:09.923 --> 01:18:11.992
Just breathe, Clark.

01:18:12.025 --> 01:18:13.160
I'm going to buy a new window.

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:16.463
Good!

01:18:16.496 --> 01:18:17.698
Because it's the right thing to do.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.836
Oh, let's go in! I need to
lie down for a minute.

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:24.738
Uh... Folks,

01:18:24.772 --> 01:18:28.075
three hours till I can
get you back inside.

01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:30.010
Oh, Jesus, really?

01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:32.079
Best I can do.

01:18:32.112 --> 01:18:33.146
Okay.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.181
Ugh.

01:18:35.683 --> 01:18:36.550
Okay.

01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:23.130
Cooper'll help you bag.

01:19:23.163 --> 01:19:24.865
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:19:35.943 --> 01:19:37.177
Hey, babe, can you come check?

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:38.546
Like this or smaller?

01:19:40.247 --> 01:19:43.584
- It's perfect.
- Oh! Thank you.

01:19:46.787 --> 01:19:49.389
Hey, Clarky, dinner's in an hour.

01:20:04.938 --> 01:20:06.674
Hi.

01:20:06.707 --> 01:20:08.108
Why were you so mean to me at the party?

01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:10.878
I'm sorry.

01:20:23.123 --> 01:20:24.257
Yeah?

01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:29.630
And I'm not going to say it.

01:20:31.732 --> 01:20:33.400
- See ya tomorrow.
- Yeah.

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:37.871
Okay, does everyone have the syllabus,

01:20:37.905 --> 01:20:42.242
"The Female Gaze, Gender and Visuality
in Contemporary Art Photography,"

01:20:42.275 --> 01:20:43.744
Professor McNulty.

01:20:43.777 --> 01:20:45.212
You want to take a picture for Mommy?

01:20:45.245 --> 01:20:47.748
- No.
- Yes, come on!

01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:49.683
And you better smile.

01:20:57.658 --> 01:20:58.659
Come here.

01:21:00.628 --> 01:21:02.095
Have fun.

01:21:02.129 --> 01:21:03.797
Be curious,

01:21:03.831 --> 01:21:05.132
and be yourself.

01:21:05.766 --> 01:21:07.067
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.302
- I love you.
- Love you too.

01:21:09.336 --> 01:21:12.272
All right. Now go have fun.

01:21:13.173 --> 01:21:16.343
- I know! Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:18.612
Okay, so in chapter one
of your textbooks,

01:21:18.646 --> 01:21:20.514
there is a series of photographs,

01:21:20.548 --> 01:21:22.182
they start on page 10.

01:21:22.215 --> 01:21:24.351
I'm gonna give you all
a second to find that,

01:21:24.384 --> 01:21:25.853
and then we'll start discussing.

01:21:33.827 --> 01:21:36.229
Okay, has everyone found it? Great!

01:21:45.873 --> 01:21:47.808
Welcome to sixth grade everyone!

01:21:47.841 --> 01:21:49.209
My name's Mrs. Howell.

01:21:49.242 --> 01:21:51.378
And let's just start
by taking attendance.

01:21:51.411 --> 01:21:53.647

- Here.

01:21:53.681 --> 01:21:55.683

01:21:55.716 --> 01:21:57.518
