00:45.070 --> 00:47.600
It was actually so thrilling and fun.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.810
Seong Ri / Rainz

00:47.870 --> 00:50.200
I felt shivers of excitement.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.410
I can't forget it.

00:53.070 --> 00:55.580
During our 1st album, we had no anti-fans.

00:54.900 --> 01:00.220
Song Yu-jin / N-Train

00:55.720 --> 00:58.860
We were nominated for the MAMA Rookie Award.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.880
I thought we could succeed. I had high hopes.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.540
We just worked together so well.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.800
Jeong Yu-jin / The Ark

01:04.540 --> 01:06.380
We were active for 3 months.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.860
We could've gotten better results

01:07.860 --> 01:09.420
if we went for longer.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.520
It was one of the most horrible moments.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.720
There was violence.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.020
And cursing.

01:15.490 --> 01:17.530
"Let's get out. We can't be here."

01:17.780 --> 01:20.500
I got a call from the office, so I went.

01:20.650 --> 01:23.630
They said they couldn't continue with us.

01:23.890 --> 01:26.190
My mind went numb.

01:26.190 --> 01:27.000
"Okay..."

01:27.360 --> 01:29.860
After I failed, everyone left.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.700
We were on a roll at first.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.390
But we were a failed idol group.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.150
Only you will stay with Starpeace.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.810
Make a decision. There are no other options.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.470
I'll think about it.

02:02.350 --> 02:04.030
Don't take too much time.

02:13.940 --> 02:14.940
Jenna!

02:18.040 --> 02:18.870
Du-ho!

02:19.710 --> 02:22.370
What in the world did you do alone?

02:25.010 --> 02:25.810
I...

02:32.020 --> 02:33.020
Seriously...

02:34.810 --> 02:36.260
What did you do by yourself that

02:36.260 --> 02:39.300
they asked for you after seeing you yesterday?

02:39.470 --> 02:40.320
Huh?

02:40.480 --> 02:41.520
We got a gig.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.480
You got it.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.450
Awesome, right?

02:50.540 --> 02:53.000
What did you do? How did this happen?

02:56.470 --> 02:59.070
Chungcheong-do Traditional Food Festival?

02:59.070 --> 03:01.620
There's a singing contest at Hoengseong Market.

03:01.620 --> 03:03.220
We're the opening act.

03:03.530 --> 03:06.010
Opening? Us? Really?

03:06.310 --> 03:08.470
You beat Viki and got the job.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.040
How?

03:10.400 --> 03:11.990
They're an active group.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.730
There are only a few days left.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.140
Clear your schedules and practice.

03:16.140 --> 03:18.290
It's been a long time since you went on stage.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.680
You'll have lots to prepare.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.100
Where can we practice?

03:25.390 --> 03:26.390
Huh?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.540
Will the agency let us use a studio?

03:30.110 --> 03:32.380
The trainees will fill the time slots.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.040
They won't give us a studio.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.840
What are you talking about?

03:37.200 --> 03:39.590
You're Starpeace. Of course you can use it.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.300
Did you find out?

03:46.600 --> 03:47.480
Not yet?

03:47.510 --> 03:49.110
Let's meet up first.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.840
The people doing it should talk.

03:53.990 --> 03:55.790
I'm not doing it. I'm busy.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.070
Hey!

03:59.360 --> 04:01.400
She's looking for them.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.500
Who?

04:04.300 --> 04:05.170
Hey...

04:13.680 --> 04:14.800
Can I come in?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.779
Working part-time is hard, right?

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
Du-ho.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.760
I know you made an effort.

04:31.660 --> 04:32.760
But I won't do it.

04:32.890 --> 04:35.159
I should've gotten a better gig.

04:35.530 --> 04:36.530
Sorry.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.000
But you should know,

04:39.430 --> 04:41.110
it's not a sloppy event.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.870
The county has a huge budget...

04:42.870 --> 04:45.110
That's not why I'm refusing to go.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.380
What?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.080
I'm leaving Cotton Candy.

04:51.610 --> 04:53.350
So I don't want to act ambiguously.

04:55.950 --> 04:56.950
Elle.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.590
I'm trying to detach myself from you guys.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.160
What will you do after tracking them down?

05:08.160 --> 05:10.530
I'll get the money back.

05:11.530 --> 05:12.940
Oh Hyun-ji!

05:12.940 --> 05:15.800
Let go! I don't have time for this.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.070
- Is that important to you?
- Yes!

05:18.070 --> 05:20.510
To me, that' the most important thing right now.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.940
So let's each do what we think is important.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.650
If you leave like this,

05:26.380 --> 05:28.310
I might really let go of you.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.860
Jenna.

05:36.890 --> 05:39.960
Want me to tell you what you really must do?

05:40.860 --> 05:42.659
Go to CEO Ma

05:43.930 --> 05:46.030
and tell him to take responsibility of us.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.909
Tell him to stop the rumors of us disbanding,

05:50.909 --> 05:53.340
and meet with us once a week.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.280
Publish our next album, promote us

05:55.280 --> 05:57.580
and get us decent gigs.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.980
Apologize for pushing us aside.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.550
Get him to apologize

06:05.950 --> 06:08.220
and tell him to keep his promise

06:09.960 --> 06:13.700
of making us famous!

06:13.700 --> 06:16.640
That's the real important thing you should do!

06:17.330 --> 06:19.940
Not going on radio and saying we've failed

06:19.940 --> 06:23.170
or doing a talent show in front of old people.

06:46.290 --> 06:47.530
- Stage costume?
- Yeah.

06:47.530 --> 06:48.930
Just wear that.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.330
I can't wear this!

06:50.330 --> 06:52.130
Want to wear my T-shirt then?

06:52.150 --> 06:53.690
That's ridiculous!

07:10.790 --> 07:16.120
Part 2
Should We Disband?

07:29.440 --> 07:31.120
Can I have a cigarette?

07:34.680 --> 07:36.040
You're not a minor, are you?

07:36.750 --> 07:37.750
Thank you.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.360
Don't be rash.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.659
You're still a singer.

07:55.659 --> 07:57.020
Control yourself.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.670
You're better than CEO Ma.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.450
What happened to them?

08:03.670 --> 08:05.670
I found someone who might know them.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.140
I can get in touch tomorrow.

08:07.910 --> 08:08.810
Hey.

08:08.810 --> 08:10.580
Are you really going to meet them?

08:10.580 --> 08:12.280
Can't you just forget it?

08:12.610 --> 08:15.220
That money shouldn't go to jerks like them.

08:20.790 --> 08:25.560
Recent news on failed idol singer doing a gig

08:25.760 --> 08:27.260
The county office official

08:27.260 --> 08:28.570
went to a relative's house

08:28.600 --> 08:30.230
and saw Jenna's performance.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.010
A sob story from a properly failed idol singer.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.610
Gahhh.

08:44.380 --> 08:46.110
It's not a sob story.

08:53.690 --> 08:54.920
Speak for yourself.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.500
Seriously...

09:04.570 --> 09:05.930
People stink.

09:14.010 --> 09:15.340
I think this item is good.

09:15.340 --> 09:16.710
- Right?
- Yeah.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.750
No.

09:25.950 --> 09:27.590
Why not?

09:27.990 --> 09:30.730
Cotton Candy has the right to use the studios.

09:30.730 --> 09:34.100
They should earn money to earn a spot.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.730
We'll get money from the upcoming gig...

09:36.730 --> 09:39.030
I said let them keep it.

09:39.030 --> 09:41.700
They need to make a living so we won't interfere.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.770
The agency clarified its position

09:42.770 --> 09:44.420
and accommodated them.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.270
Where's their sense of decency?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.610
What are you talking about?

09:48.910 --> 09:50.610
Cotton Candy is a part of Starpeace.

09:50.610 --> 09:52.480
Du-ho, you foolish blockhead!

09:52.480 --> 09:54.650
Should I roll you into a ball and kick you away?

09:54.650 --> 09:55.880
Far far away?

09:57.190 --> 09:58.790
Whose agent are you?

10:02.920 --> 10:03.960
Du-ho.

10:04.660 --> 10:06.860
Did you know we'll have a co-president?

10:07.300 --> 10:08.000
What?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.130
We'll have two CEOs from now on.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.100
When CEO Cha comes, Cotton Candy will be cut.

10:13.300 --> 10:17.110
So stop doing useless things,

10:17.110 --> 10:18.470
and play it safe.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.440
The new CEO?

10:20.440 --> 10:21.840
He's someone

10:21.840 --> 10:23.780
who sees the world in numbers.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.750
Everything is money to him.

Director Jo Sang-jik

11:00.480 --> 11:01.720
Hello?

11:03.550 --> 11:04.590
Yes.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.490
Dinner?

11:13.460 --> 11:14.860
Okay.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.900
Text me the time and place.

11:19.770 --> 11:20.700
Okay.

11:26.610 --> 11:28.290
Asst. Manager Park says

11:28.380 --> 11:30.510
it doesn't look too good for us.

11:30.950 --> 11:31.950
Oh, right.

11:32.550 --> 11:34.320
You met CEO Ma.

11:35.050 --> 11:36.820
Did he really just ask how you were?

11:37.650 --> 11:39.020
He didn't say anything else?

11:39.020 --> 11:41.960
About extending your contract before Cha comes?

11:43.090 --> 11:44.090
He just

11:44.730 --> 11:46.590
asked how we were doing.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.830
He didn't mention your song?

11:54.200 --> 11:55.150
No.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.070
Du-ho.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.070
Huh?

12:01.110 --> 12:03.710
What if I thought wrong?

12:04.150 --> 12:05.110
About what?

12:06.080 --> 12:08.480
The others not wanting to disband either.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.020
What if

12:12.820 --> 12:14.790
I was just seeing things as I wanted?

12:16.020 --> 12:17.690
What if I'm just being stubborn?

12:17.690 --> 12:18.790
Jenna.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.700
There's no way.

12:21.730 --> 12:22.560
Wait.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.570
Did they say they wanted to disband?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.870
They're not saying they won't, either.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.240
Come on.

12:29.070 --> 12:30.540
Did something happen?

12:33.640 --> 12:34.640
No.

13:00.870 --> 13:01.900
Go up?

13:01.900 --> 13:03.500
Go up. Up.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.510
Lift!

13:18.950 --> 13:21.290
One! Two! Three! Four!

13:28.030 --> 13:29.350
Work your hair!

13:34.010 --> 13:35.090
Forward.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.750
Excuse me!

13:59.860 --> 14:01.030
That was cold.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.390
Hello?

14:32.860 --> 14:34.430
Hi, Sir.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.000
Oh, in the afternoon?

14:41.670 --> 14:44.840
There will be practice because of a gig.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.540
Just this once, please?

14:46.540 --> 14:48.940
The part-timer just sent a text and isn't coming.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.150
Okay.

14:52.650 --> 14:54.220
See you tomorrow.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.220
Bye.

14:55.550 --> 14:56.550
Okay.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.240
She's no ordinary singer.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.750
She's an idol singer.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.800
You're an idol singer?

15:09.430 --> 15:10.430
Yes.

15:10.970 --> 15:12.830
She was unlucky.

15:12.930 --> 15:15.800
But her skills are one of the best

15:15.800 --> 15:17.210
in all of Korea.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.280
How did she come down all the way to you?

15:21.510 --> 15:22.380
Sir?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.650
She would've been sold ages ago.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.390
I'm kidding.

15:31.490 --> 15:33.590
I don't know the entertainment business,

15:34.520 --> 15:38.260
but I know you can't succeed with skills alone.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.930
Of course, that goes for every business.

15:43.260 --> 15:44.230
Why are you just sitting there?

15:44.430 --> 15:46.300
Pour the CEO a drink.

15:52.670 --> 15:53.570
Director Jo.

15:53.570 --> 15:54.510
Yes?

15:54.510 --> 15:56.210
You're following old customs.

15:56.340 --> 16:00.150
Now, it's the trend to pour your own drink.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.030
Sir.

16:12.560 --> 16:16.760
There's a reason she's my No.1 recruit.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.670
Stop talking about boring things at dinner.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.670
Let's eat.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.570
Okay.

16:37.490 --> 16:38.720
You're really not going to do it?

16:38.720 --> 16:39.950
How many times do I have to tell you?

16:39.950 --> 16:41.590
I showed you the video...

16:47.460 --> 16:48.500
I told you about it.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.660
Yes, you did.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.530
But I didn't say I'll do it.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.200
Hyun-ji.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.870
This is an official gig. Why are you refusing?

16:56.870 --> 16:58.440
I said I'm busy.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.740
What's wrong with you?

17:00.740 --> 17:02.310
That's what I'd like to ask you.

17:02.310 --> 17:04.250
Why are you suddenly being so loyal?

17:04.250 --> 17:06.950
You excited from karaoke two days ago?

17:09.880 --> 17:13.150
You went to a karaoke bar two days ago?

17:13.589 --> 17:16.460
You said you couldn't come because of your mom.

17:21.329 --> 17:24.300
You sang at a karaoke while Jenna was alone?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.700
You're the one to talk.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.130
If you were so concerned,

17:30.130 --> 17:31.880
you should've left the shoot.

17:31.910 --> 17:34.010
You didn't want to go, and used that as an excuse!

17:34.010 --> 17:35.110
Hey, Oh Hyun-ji!

17:35.110 --> 17:35.610
Hey!

17:35.610 --> 17:36.810
You think I'm a pushover?

17:37.010 --> 17:37.580
Huh?

17:37.580 --> 17:39.050
I asked you nicely.

17:39.050 --> 17:40.680
But you can't go two days without blabbing.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.120
Am I a doormat?

17:43.280 --> 17:44.960
Since she went alone,

17:45.390 --> 17:48.720
I thought she'd sing a couple of our songs.

17:48.720 --> 17:52.130
You thought she'd daintily sing our songs?

17:52.960 --> 17:54.300
See?

17:54.300 --> 17:55.830
I knew it.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Hey.

18:00.670 --> 18:03.040
Don't say a word about going to karaoke that day.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.710
I'm sorry. It just came out.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.280
"It just came out"?

18:07.280 --> 18:08.840
You're always like this.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.810
You look down on me, use me and desert me!

18:10.810 --> 18:12.050
How dare you turn me into trash?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.550
Hyun-ji, watch what you're saying!

18:13.550 --> 18:15.050
You stay out of this.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.480
You're pretentious, too.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.350
All of you, stop it!

18:18.950 --> 18:19.620
Let go.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.360
Did I ask you to go to karaoke?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.160
Did I ask you to go?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.290
I don't believe you.

18:23.290 --> 18:25.890
You had fun for someone who didn't want to go.

18:25.890 --> 18:28.360
I've never seen anyone enjoy herself that much...

19:36.930 --> 19:37.930
Hyun-ji!

19:38.870 --> 19:39.870
Hyun-ji!

19:41.870 --> 19:44.110
I said no marketplace gigs.

19:45.770 --> 19:48.240
I clearly told you way back.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.850
Everything is okay, except for the marketplace.

19:51.580 --> 19:52.880
Don't you remember?

19:54.380 --> 19:56.280
I asked you nicely.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.420
I asked you!

20:01.590 --> 20:03.930
You don't care about me at all.

20:04.790 --> 20:06.660
You follow those hotshots Highteen

20:06.660 --> 20:08.530
so I seem ridiculous to you, huh?

20:10.100 --> 20:11.070
That's not true.

20:11.070 --> 20:13.330
Of course it's true.

20:15.470 --> 20:16.640
I knew it

20:16.640 --> 20:18.340
when you abandoned us

20:18.340 --> 20:19.880
and fell at their feet.

20:20.810 --> 20:22.510
I didn't abandon you.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.880
I was assigned to them. I had no choice.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.350
Still, you shouldn't have left us.

20:28.650 --> 20:31.920
You shouldn't have abandoned us.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.260
You, of all people,

20:36.320 --> 20:39.990
shouldn't have abandoned us.

20:40.430 --> 20:42.660
You said we're the best.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.970
You said we're the prettiest.

20:43.970 --> 20:46.000
You said we're your dream!

20:46.200 --> 20:48.200
I hate you the most.

20:49.670 --> 20:50.670
Hyun-ji!

20:51.410 --> 20:52.470
Hyun-ji!

21:00.310 --> 21:03.820
Marketplace Love Talent Show

21:26.470 --> 21:29.110
Wow, that tiny peanut of a thing

21:29.110 --> 21:30.540
can sing and dance so well.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.710
She'll become a famous singer.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.620
The elevator is going down.

22:41.780 --> 22:43.420
The doors are shutting.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.450
That cheeky bastard.

23:17.990 --> 23:20.320
Playing hard to get is for when you date.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.520
He won't even be investing that much.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.030
How dare he weigh us out?

23:28.330 --> 23:30.300
Don't call me to meetings like this from now on.

23:31.100 --> 23:34.000
I only came because you helped me last time.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.000
Hey.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.640
It's just dinner.

23:38.170 --> 23:40.240
Don't be so snippy.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.240
Also,

23:41.240 --> 23:44.040
it's good to know a lot of people.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.450
These days,

23:47.820 --> 23:50.750
investors don't expect sexual favors.

23:50.750 --> 23:51.750
Also,

23:51.990 --> 23:54.290
you have to think about the investor.

23:54.390 --> 23:56.320
He'll have to see the goods.

23:56.660 --> 23:59.590
Would you buy something without seeing it first?

23:59.590 --> 24:01.030
This isn't a charity.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.230
Why am I your goods?

24:04.230 --> 24:05.900
Are you quibbling over conditions?

24:06.330 --> 24:07.770
In your situation,

24:07.770 --> 24:10.040
my company's conditions are the best.

24:11.970 --> 24:14.180
Set up a company first, then talk.

24:15.740 --> 24:16.880
I'm leaving.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.990
Hey, hey, hey. Wait.

24:30.660 --> 24:31.460
How much is it?

24:31.460 --> 24:33.160
KRW 220,000.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.540
Do you have KRW 60,000?

24:45.470 --> 24:46.310
What?

24:46.310 --> 24:47.470
I'm short of money.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.850
If things went well, CEO Park would've paid.

24:54.150 --> 24:55.720
This is all your fault.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.990
Don't ever call me again.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.220
We're an ugly sight to see.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.020
Right?

26:09.790 --> 26:11.260
About Hyun-ji and Elle...

26:11.460 --> 26:13.060
I'll persuade them.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.830
It's a gig Du-ho got for us in a long time.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.300
We can't have just the three of us up there.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.440
We're performing in a long time.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.450
CEO Ma said

26:36.120 --> 26:37.800
when our contract is up,

26:40.590 --> 26:42.060
he'll disband us.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.170
Really?

26:54.540 --> 26:55.400
So...

26:56.940 --> 26:58.870
he's made up his mind?

27:00.310 --> 27:01.310
Yes.

27:05.980 --> 27:08.280
And he'll just take me on.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.490
I told him I'll think about it.

27:29.630 --> 27:30.790
Jenna...

27:36.180 --> 27:37.410
I'm sorry, Stella.

27:38.350 --> 27:39.750
For wavering.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.090
Everyone not wanting to disband...

27:55.100 --> 27:56.160
That just

27:58.030 --> 27:59.970
might be my delusion.

28:05.170 --> 28:07.370
I guess I wanted to prove to the world.

28:09.710 --> 28:11.910
That even in a failed household, people live.

28:15.250 --> 28:16.720
That we live well.

28:17.650 --> 28:19.320
That our relationship is different.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.530
That's what I valued.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.060
Like Elle said,

28:32.800 --> 28:34.470
I guess I was less desperate.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.110
I think what I insisted is ridiculous.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.450
I think it's time we made a decision.

29:50.170 --> 29:51.210
Darn it...

30:00.690 --> 30:02.220
Excuse me!

30:04.890 --> 30:05.890
Oh, uh...

30:06.360 --> 30:07.960
I know I'm a stranger,

30:08.260 --> 30:09.800
but I have to ask for a favor.

30:12.370 --> 30:13.370
I think

30:13.900 --> 30:15.870
I dropped my credit card there.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.810
I don't have bus fare. Can I borrow KRW 10,000?

30:21.310 --> 30:22.880
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

30:25.310 --> 30:28.020
I don't know you. I can't make exchanges.

30:29.350 --> 30:31.290
You don't know me?

30:32.620 --> 30:35.520
Then why did you keep glancing at me?

30:36.160 --> 30:37.190
What?

30:37.190 --> 30:38.630
You know me.

30:39.490 --> 30:41.030
CEO Cha Jae-hyuk.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.870
You'll be the co-president of Starpeace soon.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.870
No way you don't know all its artists.

30:52.010 --> 30:52.940
You're very observant.

30:52.940 --> 30:54.540
It's a survival instinct.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.880
I want to clear things up first.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.110
I didn't keep glancing at you.

30:59.110 --> 31:00.710
Like you said, I was wondering what

31:00.710 --> 31:02.980
a Starpeace artist was doing.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.050
It didn't look too good.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.690
Please lend me KRW 10,000.

31:18.470 --> 31:19.570
It's too much.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.370
That's the only bill I have.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.350
What time should I meet you tomorrow?

31:31.350 --> 31:32.310
No need.

31:32.310 --> 31:33.480
I'll consider it a meal bought

31:33.480 --> 31:35.030
for an artist at my agency.

32:21.630 --> 32:22.760
Tonight,

32:23.400 --> 32:24.970
let's vote about disbanding.

32:47.020 --> 32:48.390
What's this all of a sudden?

32:52.290 --> 32:53.830
It's just as I said.

32:53.830 --> 32:55.500
So why now?

32:56.460 --> 32:58.200
We were going to do it last time.

33:00.730 --> 33:03.100
Is it because I told you to go talk to CEO Ma?

33:03.100 --> 33:03.800
No.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.940
Then what?

33:04.940 --> 33:07.780
You're mad we made you do a gig alone?

33:08.140 --> 33:10.110
You know the reason better than me.

33:12.210 --> 33:14.850
The two of you want to leave the most.

33:21.890 --> 33:23.460
So you're saying

33:24.520 --> 33:25.830
that we are

33:26.090 --> 33:28.060
the reason we're disbanding?

33:31.030 --> 33:33.370
Alright. I agree.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.100
Happy?

33:36.300 --> 33:39.540
Mark it here and put it in the box.

33:43.510 --> 33:46.380
If you agree to disband, draw a circle.

33:47.810 --> 33:49.320
If you disagree, leave it blank.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.990
This is childish.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.020
Let's just decide here and now!

34:02.630 --> 34:04.060
This will be the last time.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.100
Think carefully.

34:07.940 --> 34:09.300
Not out of anger.

34:17.610 --> 34:19.550
You know this is stupid, right?

34:23.320 --> 34:25.090
Our vote doesn't matter.

34:51.980 --> 34:53.310
It looks like

34:54.510 --> 34:56.179
Jenna is still really angry.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.990
Why did I not go?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.960
I shouldn't have listened to Hyun-ji.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.300
You disagree with disbanding, right?

35:19.810 --> 35:21.490
I don't know what to do.

35:23.110 --> 35:25.440
I don't like this,

35:27.310 --> 35:29.250
but that doesn't mean I want to disband.

35:30.220 --> 35:33.450
And Elle is right.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.290
Our opinion doesn't matter.

35:39.530 --> 35:40.690
Because

35:41.460 --> 35:43.330
if the agency doesn't renew our contract,

35:43.930 --> 35:45.130
we'll disband anyway.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.400
Chae-ah.

35:48.670 --> 35:49.670
Huh?

35:50.740 --> 35:52.310
Agree to disband.

35:54.270 --> 35:55.680
I'll agree, too.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.440
Huh?

36:23.470 --> 36:24.970
Is your shoot in the afternoon?

36:25.670 --> 36:26.510
Yes.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.180
Oh, about the studio.

36:28.180 --> 36:31.140
It's fully booked because of a dance competition.

36:32.050 --> 36:33.080
Okay.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.750
I'll look around more this morning.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.150
Okay.

36:37.550 --> 36:39.720
I'm making chicken deliveries in the afternoon.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.860
The owner there asked for a favor.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.860
Okay, then I'll see you in the evening.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.290
You found them?

36:45.290 --> 36:46.290
Where?

36:46.460 --> 36:48.190
Okay, I'm heading out now.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.730
Do whatever you want with the gig.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.070
But stop looking for those boys.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.710
I won't just take it meekly like you.

36:58.810 --> 37:01.010
I can't do anything about powerful people.

37:01.410 --> 37:04.610
But I won't be stepped on by trash.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.250
That's useless pride.

37:09.780 --> 37:12.150
I understand how you feel.

37:12.550 --> 37:15.420
But acting like this will only get you hurt.

37:18.290 --> 37:19.960
You're so high and mighty.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.500
I live like there's no tomorrow.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.230
So let me live out the way I feel.

37:28.470 --> 37:30.700
You go check that box.

37:31.170 --> 37:33.240
Seems like everyone finished voting.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.980
Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji...

37:55.300 --> 37:56.200
What do you think?

37:56.200 --> 37:57.460
Not bad.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.100
But it's not that good either?

37:59.100 --> 38:00.470
"I'm Bbiyong."

38:00.770 --> 38:02.270
Seems like the song is saying that.

38:02.270 --> 38:04.040
Is that why you don't like it?

38:04.300 --> 38:06.240
Then you're being biased.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.880
I'm not that irrational.

38:12.510 --> 38:14.980
Anyway, this is difficult to tackle.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.020
A song that's neither good or bad.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.290
Let's sing it.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.000
Cue the MR.

38:39.810 --> 38:44.110
I'm getting more curious today

38:44.110 --> 38:47.980
In search of the meaning of that hot moment

38:47.980 --> 38:52.150
In the notepad I can't erase

38:52.150 --> 38:54.920
I hid you deep like a secret

38:54.920 --> 39:00.060
Thanks to you, I know my true heart

39:00.060 --> 39:02.900
It's more beautiful

39:02.900 --> 39:07.200
I have no ideal, your language

39:07.200 --> 39:11.070
Lingers in my heart

39:11.070 --> 39:12.610
And baby it's like

39:12.610 --> 39:17.010
Side by side, next to you, with the same tempo

39:17.010 --> 39:20.810
Walking in step with you, our harmony will echo

39:20.810 --> 39:26.490
People come and go, but I will never let go

39:26.490 --> 39:28.490
I know it baby

39:29.520 --> 39:33.630
Open your closed heart

39:33.630 --> 39:38.030
One, two, three, fill it with us

39:38.030 --> 39:43.440
Create endless love

39:43.440 --> 39:47.540
And I'm talking to the moon

39:51.750 --> 39:53.450
Oh, baby

39:53.450 --> 39:59.920
May it shine brighter on our tomorrow

39:59.920 --> 40:02.160
I pray

40:10.630 --> 40:12.270
They should give you a better role.

40:12.270 --> 40:13.630
You're so pretty.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.870
I can't believe they want you to look beaten up.

40:20.470 --> 40:21.710
By the way,

40:22.480 --> 40:23.710
do you know if

40:23.710 --> 40:27.310
they're continuing with this show?

40:27.310 --> 40:30.350
I have no idea. I'm not with the network.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.590
But it seems like

40:33.590 --> 40:36.290
they're discussing it due to production costs.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.160
Why?

40:38.390 --> 40:39.790
Worried you might be out of work?

40:39.790 --> 40:41.660
No

40:43.900 --> 40:45.430
Don't do this anymore.

40:45.430 --> 40:46.900
You'll get stuck with this image.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.700
Find another part-time job.

40:52.270 --> 40:54.370
Why change all the passwords to the studios?

40:54.370 --> 40:55.640
Tell me what it is.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.440
I can't.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.650
We'll come at night so we don't disturb anyone.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.510
- At night.
- Don't ask me.

41:01.510 --> 41:03.080
Du-ho is at it again.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.250
Asst. Manager Lee!

41:04.250 --> 41:05.320
Please tell me this once.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.220
- Looks like Director Lee has taken measures.
- Don't do this to me. I'll get in trouble.

41:08.220 --> 41:09.520
I'll take full responsibility.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.560
Go away.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.360
Want a cup of coffee? Americano?

41:12.360 --> 41:13.430
No!

41:29.310 --> 41:31.280
Mars, Mars...

41:31.440 --> 41:33.380
It's all Mars.

41:33.610 --> 41:36.020
Even trainees are allowed. Why not Cotton Candy?

41:36.020 --> 41:37.000
Seriously.

41:37.030 --> 41:38.080
- Du-ho.
- Huh?

41:39.420 --> 41:40.420
Hi.

41:40.420 --> 41:42.360
You didn't go with Highteen to Europe?

41:42.620 --> 41:43.520
Huh?

41:44.460 --> 41:45.630
Oh, well.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.830
I'm afraid of airplanes.

41:48.830 --> 41:50.030
All of a sudden?

41:50.030 --> 41:51.100
I'm scared of heights.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.070
Oh.

41:53.130 --> 41:54.100
You know...

41:54.100 --> 41:54.730
Yeah.

41:54.730 --> 41:56.240
The leader of Cotton Candy.

41:57.070 --> 41:57.940
Jenna?

41:58.810 --> 42:01.070
She sang a song in the studio,

42:01.470 --> 42:02.810
and you danced.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
Yeah.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.240
Who wrote that song?

42:05.240 --> 42:06.680
Jenna.

42:06.680 --> 42:07.880
It's good, right?

42:07.880 --> 42:09.520
We're putting it in the next album.

42:09.780 --> 42:10.920
Then

42:11.380 --> 42:13.120
give me Jenna's phone number.

42:13.220 --> 42:14.220
Huh?

42:15.390 --> 42:16.990
No.

42:17.290 --> 42:18.690
Don't try to make a move.

42:18.690 --> 42:19.930
No.

42:19.930 --> 42:21.830
That's not it. I just want to ask her something.

42:21.830 --> 42:22.900
No.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.330
No!

42:25.130 --> 42:28.200
Come to think of it, I don't know you that well.

42:28.770 --> 42:30.740
Why are you acting friendly?

42:31.770 --> 42:32.770
Don't call me.

42:32.770 --> 42:33.910
Du-ho...

42:46.720 --> 42:47.650
Boo!

42:50.160 --> 42:52.830
Yay, it's our song.

42:53.130 --> 42:54.960
Hey, I really

42:54.960 --> 42:56.900
didn't want to make a celebrity work.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.930
But the delivery guys are on a strike.

42:58.930 --> 42:59.700
I'm sorry.

42:59.700 --> 43:00.670
In return,

43:00.670 --> 43:02.940
I'll play your songs all day long.

43:05.370 --> 43:06.370
Well.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.640
I have a lot on my mind.

43:10.110 --> 43:13.110
So I'll work hard to clear out my thoughts.

43:13.980 --> 43:14.710
It's here?

43:14.710 --> 43:16.120
Yeah. In the basement.

43:16.120 --> 43:17.880
They're going live in 20 minutes.

43:27.590 --> 43:28.900
You're really going to do this?

43:35.200 --> 43:36.370
Why are you here?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.310
Don't pick a fight and leave.

43:39.310 --> 43:41.010
We have to do a show.

43:41.010 --> 43:42.940
You said you'll make me famous.

43:45.850 --> 43:47.200
You said I'll hit the jackpot

43:47.200 --> 43:49.750
with one photo on your social media.

43:50.580 --> 43:53.450
If I go on your show, I might become world-famous.

43:53.550 --> 43:54.450
What?

43:55.660 --> 43:57.920
Tell people to come watch a failed idol singer.

43:59.260 --> 44:00.790
Tout for business.

44:02.930 --> 44:04.800
What can you do?

44:09.570 --> 44:10.570
Everything.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.800
The Last Boss
Two Men

44:14.240 --> 44:15.480
She's good
Totally cool

44:15.480 --> 44:16.740
A new segment for failed idol singers?
She's the full package

44:21.040 --> 44:22.880
She must have no spine
Her dance skills are fantastic

44:23.020 --> 44:24.980
Wow, awesome.

44:26.990 --> 44:28.420
Do something that's more fun?

44:28.720 --> 44:30.720
I'm having so much fun, you guys.

44:31.860 --> 44:33.290
Something flashy and X-rated?

44:33.290 --> 44:34.190
Leave.

44:34.190 --> 44:35.560
That's a no-no.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.730
Get a grip, you guys.

44:37.730 --> 44:40.400
This isn't an X-rated show.

44:40.730 --> 44:43.070
Grade school kids should go to bed.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.180
Sad it's over
Dance again

44:51.180 --> 44:52.580
She's really good
She dances better than Highteen

44:52.680 --> 44:54.050
Awesome, right, guys?

44:54.050 --> 44:56.050
How did she become a ruined idol singer?

44:56.050 --> 44:57.420
It's a mystery to me.

44:57.420 --> 44:58.750
It's a mystery.

45:00.820 --> 45:03.620
I'd love a cold beer.

45:04.590 --> 45:05.990
Can we not drink on camera?

45:05.990 --> 45:07.630
Nothing is impossible.

45:07.630 --> 45:08.900
Do whatever you want.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.900
I'm parched.

45:10.900 --> 45:12.630
Since I danced, let's drink.

45:14.130 --> 45:15.600
How well do you hold your liquor?

45:15.600 --> 45:16.620
You saw that day.

45:16.620 --> 45:18.230
I can hold it better than you.

45:20.110 --> 45:21.980
You were so wasted that day.

45:21.980 --> 45:23.910
You were the one that was wasted.

45:23.910 --> 45:25.710
It was ridiculous.

45:26.710 --> 45:28.180
You coming at me?

45:28.180 --> 45:28.980
Guys.

45:28.980 --> 45:31.520
Failed idol singers are so scary.

45:31.520 --> 45:34.450
You know she's blatantly lying, right?

45:32.940 --> 45:34.360
No!
How should we know?

45:34.360 --> 45:36.460
The failed idol is better
Stop being jealous and man up

45:35.560 --> 45:37.990
Come on.

45:37.990 --> 45:39.730
I said I won.

45:39.050 --> 45:42.050
Settle the matter here
Fight! Fight! Fight!

45:39.730 --> 45:42.530
She was totally wasted that day.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.830
I think you were wasted
You can't settle it because you'll lose

45:44.630 --> 45:45.460
Hey.

45:45.460 --> 45:48.430
How can I bet on drinks with a girl?

45:45.830 --> 45:47.830
He talks a lot
Don't be so petty, Two Men

45:49.270 --> 45:50.370
Let's do it.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.710
For KRW 2 million.

45:58.350 --> 45:59.410
Whoa! KRW 2mil.?
She's got guts!

46:00.280 --> 46:01.960
What are you playing at?

46:02.450 --> 46:04.820
You came for this, right? For the money?

46:04.980 --> 46:05.950
Yeah.

46:05.950 --> 46:07.050
Why you...

46:07.720 --> 46:09.760
You want to shut down your show forever?

46:08.720 --> 46:11.120
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Don't be scared! Fight!

46:09.760 --> 46:11.890
The response is explosive.

46:12.190 --> 46:13.590
You're making a mistake.

46:15.190 --> 46:17.300
Why are you such a sissy?

46:17.300 --> 46:19.030
You said you're better than me.

46:19.030 --> 46:20.570
If you win, you get an additional KRW 2 mil.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.640
Why are you both glaring at me?

46:25.100 --> 46:27.110
Right, you guys?

46:37.960 --> 46:39.220
Let's do this!
It's gonna start

46:39.220 --> 46:40.490
Here comes the alcohol!
Two Men is going to lose

46:39.960 --> 46:40.720
Okay.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.120
Ready.

46:43.020 --> 46:44.020
Get set.

46:44.050 --> 46:46.690
Savage from the start
A game with KRW 2 mil. at stake

46:44.590 --> 46:45.590
Go!

46:46.690 --> 46:48.930
KRW 2 mil. bet
The drinking speed is different

46:48.930 --> 46:51.820
Going down smoothly
So much fun
Who will win?
Look at the failed idol's eyes!
KRW 2mil. is at stake
This is fun

46:59.620 --> 47:01.490
You're going to regret this.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.180
I'll make the deliveries.

47:31.470 --> 47:32.370
Hey, stop there.

47:32.370 --> 47:33.290
Stop right there!

47:33.290 --> 47:34.090
Hey, hey!

47:34.090 --> 47:35.450
Give me my money!

47:35.540 --> 47:36.650
I'm going to kill her!

47:36.650 --> 47:38.010
Hey! Hey!

47:38.270 --> 47:39.640
Stop right there!

47:39.660 --> 47:41.020
Give me my money!

47:48.540 --> 47:51.730
A bird woke me up this morning.

47:52.630 --> 47:53.750
Was it a lark?

47:54.400 --> 47:55.760
- Or...
- Stop.

47:56.490 --> 47:57.560
If you think about the lines, you ruin it.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.230
I told you to relax your shoulders.

47:59.230 --> 48:01.180
Didn't I tell you to breathe out first?

48:01.200 --> 48:02.660
How many times do I have to tell you?

48:02.660 --> 48:03.960
Let's see the script.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.280
Hey.

48:26.360 --> 48:28.690
Your glass is flowing like a river.

48:29.090 --> 48:30.090
I'm done.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Oh, no!

48:43.020 --> 48:44.140
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm sorry.

48:44.140 --> 48:45.550
Leave it. Leave it.

48:45.550 --> 48:46.720
You'll hurt yourself.

48:46.990 --> 48:48.440
Good work today.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.400
Change out of the uniform.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.080
Deliver this and go home.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.160
Here.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.640
Thank you.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.880
I'll come to eat next time.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.210
Oh, the giveaway.

49:01.560 --> 49:02.560
Here.

49:02.930 --> 49:05.580
It's really popular.

49:07.490 --> 49:08.890
Thank you.

49:23.150 --> 49:24.830
What is she doing here?

49:26.230 --> 49:27.230
What?

49:30.360 --> 49:31.970
She's the youngest in Cotton Candy.

49:34.540 --> 49:35.540
What's with her?

49:35.770 --> 49:37.940
Is she lashing out because they're disbanding?

49:40.650 --> 49:41.960
Something bad might happen.

49:42.410 --> 49:44.000
These guys aren't good people.

50:02.780 --> 50:04.220
I paid in advance.

50:18.150 --> 50:18.780
What's up, Ae-rin?

50:18.780 --> 50:20.140
We're in big trouble.

50:20.250 --> 50:21.370
Where are you?

50:21.710 --> 50:22.710
Huh? Hey!

50:24.190 --> 50:25.450
Where are you going?

50:25.780 --> 50:27.170
Make sure nothing happens until I get there.

50:27.170 --> 50:28.170
I'll try.

50:28.490 --> 50:29.280
Hurry.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.920
- Okay. See you.
- Excuse me!

50:34.360 --> 50:35.360
Excuse me.

50:35.410 --> 50:36.410
What?

50:36.460 --> 50:37.890
The chicken has already been paid for.

50:37.890 --> 50:38.980
That's not it.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.240
I need to ask you a favor.

50:40.380 --> 50:41.810
I'm in a hurry.

50:41.990 --> 50:43.230
Let's talk later.

50:47.180 --> 50:48.860
You can't get a cab here.

50:55.750 --> 50:58.120
Du-ho

51:14.730 --> 51:17.390
Why is your youngest doing a show there?

51:24.790 --> 51:26.240
She has her reasons.

51:52.840 --> 51:53.840
Thanks.

51:56.210 --> 51:57.450
What are you doing?

51:57.450 --> 51:59.130
You can't do it alone.

51:59.250 --> 52:00.940
Is this fun to you?

52:01.730 --> 52:03.350
Go, before someone sees you.

52:26.470 --> 52:27.470
I drank it.

52:28.600 --> 52:29.600
Your turn.

52:30.820 --> 52:31.820
If I drink

52:32.030 --> 52:34.610
this, I win, okay? I'm going to drink. It's good.

52:34.810 --> 52:35.750
Look.

52:37.640 --> 52:38.040
Get up.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.560
What are you doing?

52:40.760 --> 52:41.760
Oh Hyun-ji!

52:41.760 --> 52:44.140
Let go! Let go of me!

52:44.140 --> 52:45.030
I'm going to win!

52:45.050 --> 52:46.090
Drag her out.

52:46.270 --> 52:47.690
Hey! What are you doing?

52:47.670 --> 52:50.270
Here's the crackdown
That's captain of the failed idols, Jenna!

52:47.690 --> 52:48.690
Oh Hyun-ji!

52:48.940 --> 52:50.340
If you leave now, you lose.

52:50.270 --> 52:51.960
Tell Jenna to leave!
Jenna, go away!

52:50.340 --> 52:51.940
Yeah, right! Let go.

52:52.220 --> 52:53.960
Look. Look.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.130
I drank it. I won.

52:57.130 --> 52:58.170
You saw, right?

52:58.170 --> 52:59.170
Oh Hyun-ji!

52:59.310 --> 53:00.500
What?

53:00.520 --> 53:02.810
I have to take that.

53:02.810 --> 53:04.720
I have to take that!

53:05.100 --> 53:06.940
Let go!

53:11.730 --> 53:13.020
Hey! I won!

53:13.020 --> 53:14.170
Hey, wake up!

53:14.170 --> 53:16.650
Hey, let's go again!

53:17.500 --> 53:18.920
Let go!

53:18.950 --> 53:21.230
I said I hold my liquor better than him!

53:21.950 --> 53:23.640
Put her down. We can drag her.

53:25.410 --> 53:27.710
Hey, you hussy. How dare you run away?

53:28.250 --> 53:29.250
Let her go.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.650
Leave the money here!

53:30.650 --> 53:31.770
Don't do that.

53:32.060 --> 53:32.930
Are you joking?

53:32.930 --> 53:34.050
Stop!

53:34.240 --> 53:35.360
Move!

53:35.820 --> 53:36.820
Jenna!

53:38.930 --> 53:40.170
Is he insane?

53:44.040 --> 53:45.040
Let's go!

53:58.740 --> 53:59.740
Who are you?

54:39.900 --> 54:40.900
Thank you.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.650
What's going on? What happened to her?

54:59.480 --> 55:00.480
Wait.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.110
She reeks of booze.

55:03.690 --> 55:05.050
Careful, careful.

55:05.330 --> 55:06.330
Careful.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.160
Hyun-ji, lie down.

55:12.190 --> 55:13.980
What's wrong with her?

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
Well then.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.240
I'll be going now.

55:22.710 --> 55:24.280
Okay, Ae-rin.

55:24.690 --> 55:25.930
Thanks for everything.

55:25.930 --> 55:27.910
Ae-rin, what happened?

55:40.700 --> 55:42.140
Are you happy now?

55:51.110 --> 55:52.790
How could you go there?

55:53.750 --> 55:55.430
What were you thinking?

55:56.190 --> 55:58.460
What if something happened to you?

55:58.830 --> 56:00.900
I went, knowing they were doing a live show.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.510
They won't do anything during a live show.

56:05.590 --> 56:07.380
What's this? Huh?

56:08.030 --> 56:09.030
Let go.

56:09.450 --> 56:11.500
Let go. It's my money!

56:12.930 --> 56:15.220
You think I'll give up if you act like this?

56:15.480 --> 56:16.760
What's going on?

56:18.400 --> 56:19.400
Okay.

56:20.790 --> 56:22.310
The world is right.

56:24.060 --> 56:25.640
We're finished.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.370
I'll admit it.

56:28.660 --> 56:29.940
A second chance?

56:30.470 --> 56:31.870
That doesn't exist.

56:32.670 --> 56:34.960
I deceived all of you.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.440
I was giving false hope.

56:41.020 --> 56:43.220
Was this what you wanted to hear?

56:43.370 --> 56:44.370
Huh?

56:45.560 --> 56:47.960
Were you waiting for me to say that?

56:48.960 --> 56:50.830
Is that why you're acting up?

56:50.830 --> 56:52.510
Just to hear me say that?

57:02.190 --> 57:03.190
Okay.

57:04.800 --> 57:05.800
Give up.

57:06.030 --> 57:07.390
Stop now.

57:08.740 --> 57:10.220
I won't hold you back.

57:11.680 --> 57:13.310
But I won't stop.

57:13.500 --> 57:14.690
If you leave,

57:15.630 --> 57:17.960
I'll get someone to fill your spot.

57:18.210 --> 57:20.740
If Elle leaves, I'll get someone else.

57:21.270 --> 57:23.740
If Chae-ah leaves, I'll fill her spot, too.

57:23.910 --> 57:26.050
Filling our spots won't work.

57:26.050 --> 57:28.210
It won't work!

57:28.210 --> 57:29.570
I'll still do it!

57:29.950 --> 57:31.990
So you can leave,

57:32.490 --> 57:34.170
and do whatever you want.

57:34.480 --> 57:36.730
Find a good-paying job and live a good life.

57:36.730 --> 57:37.730
Do you

57:38.160 --> 57:40.600
know what kind of money this is?

57:44.290 --> 57:46.350
That chubby fool

57:48.650 --> 57:50.170
didn't eat,

57:50.260 --> 57:52.950
didn't dress himself and saved up.

57:53.510 --> 57:54.250
Hey.

57:54.270 --> 57:56.040
Do you go to TV stations wearing this?

57:56.450 --> 57:58.600
No, it's a casual T-shirt.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.100
I'm going to throw it away later.

58:07.530 --> 58:09.070
His dream was

58:10.300 --> 58:12.910
getting married, buying a small place...

58:12.940 --> 58:14.480
I can super glue this.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.760
...and having a daughter and son.

58:23.840 --> 58:24.880
What is that?

58:25.320 --> 58:27.690
What kind of dream is that?

58:31.320 --> 58:32.760
For that,

58:34.180 --> 58:35.420
he won't eat

58:36.160 --> 58:38.220
or dress properly. He's saving up.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.960
Isn't he an idiot?

58:43.350 --> 58:45.030
Even if he's from the deep countryside,

58:45.030 --> 58:46.710
how can he be so naïve?

58:47.600 --> 58:49.280
It's that kind of money.

58:49.770 --> 58:52.050
But for a delinquent like me,

58:53.150 --> 58:55.690
he gives that money to those trashy bastards.

58:57.980 --> 58:59.470
I won't have it.

59:00.450 --> 59:02.970
Why is that fool our agent?

59:05.540 --> 59:08.220
Why is our agent such a fool?

59:10.080 --> 59:12.200
Why did we fail,

59:12.470 --> 59:15.850
ending up sponging off of that fool?

59:19.990 --> 59:22.550
All of you! Get out!

59:31.600 --> 59:32.500
Hyun-ji!

59:32.500 --> 59:33.390
Hyun-ji!

59:33.390 --> 59:34.430
Are you okay?

59:34.430 --> 59:35.430
Hyun-ji!

59:36.250 --> 59:37.250
Hyun-ji...

59:55.870 --> 59:56.870
Sir.

59:57.310 --> 59:58.750
Where are you now?

1:00:26.050 --> 1:00:29.140
I just got off the plane. What's so urgent?

1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:35.400
You said you'll only sign me on.

1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:37.980
Yes.

1:00:38.740 --> 1:00:40.470
I also told you not to take too long.

1:00:40.970 --> 1:00:42.240
Did you make a decision?

1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:44.060
Yes.

1:00:47.330 --> 1:00:48.330
Good.

1:00:49.410 --> 1:00:52.210
Rest up for the remaining contract period.

1:00:52.770 --> 1:00:54.380
Plans for you will be

1:00:54.380 --> 1:00:55.910
discussed with the planning team.

1:00:55.910 --> 1:00:57.430
I'll die with them.

1:00:59.530 --> 1:01:00.530
No.

1:01:00.970 --> 1:01:01.970
I will

1:01:02.610 --> 1:01:03.810
survive with them.

1:01:06.610 --> 1:01:08.290
I won't stay on by myself.

1:01:08.610 --> 1:01:11.280
If you must throw us out six months from now,

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:12.480
then do it.

1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:15.820
The captain who tries to save only himself

1:01:16.230 --> 1:01:18.310
on a sinking boat will be you, not me.

1:01:25.100 --> 1:01:26.850
What's this?

1:01:27.450 --> 1:01:29.180
Oh...

1:01:29.850 --> 1:01:32.080
It's not waterproofed.

1:01:32.350 --> 1:01:34.210
Oh, dear.

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:37.120
Come on. It's okay.

1:01:37.170 --> 1:01:38.480
We can clean up.

1:01:38.710 --> 1:01:39.710
Let's clean.

1:01:39.730 --> 1:01:40.740
Fight on! Fight on!

1:01:40.740 --> 1:01:41.740
Great!

1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:56.380
How can water leak?

1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:58.100
How much is the monthly rent?

1:01:58.100 --> 1:01:59.940
When do we got to step on land?

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.070
When will you hang up a mirror?

1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:03.610
Fun, right?

1:02:03.610 --> 1:02:04.610
Let's go!

1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:06.220
Sir!

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:13.940
Seriously.

1:02:29.900 --> 1:02:32.190
But there's something that captain doesn't know.

1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:34.080
Our boat

1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:36.510
will not sink.

1:02:44.030 --> 1:02:45.030
Also...

1:02:50.070 --> 1:02:52.730
Don't try to use me to feel less guilty.

1:02:54.010 --> 1:02:55.740
I'm not that big of a fool

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.360
to not know that.

1:03:00.750 --> 1:03:02.190
I'll be going now.

1:03:02.810 --> 1:03:05.410
We have an important gig to prepare for.

1:04:55.460 --> 1:04:57.720
What happened to getting a studio?

1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:09.440
This is why

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:11.510
we failed.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.800
How can you all be so incompetent?

1:05:16.110 --> 1:05:18.200
Just you wait.

1:05:18.570 --> 1:05:21.580
See who's the real big shot of Cotton Candy.

1:05:24.030 --> 1:05:26.190
Hi, there.

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:28.100
I'm Oh Hyun-ji.

1:05:29.870 --> 1:05:31.080
Oh, well.

1:05:31.190 --> 1:05:32.880
Can I borrow your dance studio

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:34.430
later in the evening?

1:05:37.430 --> 1:05:38.680
It's all booked?

1:05:40.310 --> 1:05:41.910
A dance competition?

1:05:42.230 --> 1:05:43.420
Everywhere else, too?

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:46.830
Oh, uh.

1:05:47.500 --> 1:05:49.410
Okay. Thanks.

1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.340
Jeez.

1:05:56.830 --> 1:05:58.350
Big shot, my foot.

1:05:58.500 --> 1:05:59.670
You just got shot down.

1:05:59.700 --> 1:06:00.800
Don't laugh.

1:06:00.860 --> 1:06:01.860
Okay.

1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:04.020
Until Jenna's breakfast is done,

1:06:04.050 --> 1:06:05.410
let's go stretch.

1:06:06.690 --> 1:06:08.770
Wow. Look at your love handles.

1:06:08.770 --> 1:06:10.020
What are you talking about?

1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:11.600
I dance at clubs every night.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:12.870
Come on.

1:06:12.910 --> 1:06:14.060
Let's go.

1:06:14.340 --> 1:06:15.340
Jenna.

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:17.140
You didn't deceive us, did you?

1:06:17.730 --> 1:06:19.610
We're not finished yet, right?

1:06:20.190 --> 1:06:21.700
The world is wrong, right?

1:06:22.590 --> 1:06:24.200
They know nothing!

1:06:24.580 --> 1:06:26.920
You're unbelievable.

1:06:27.340 --> 1:06:29.640
Let's go. Let's go.

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:30.510
Let's go.

1:06:30.510 --> 1:06:32.740
Where has Elle gone this early in the morning?

1:06:32.740 --> 1:06:35.010
Should we just kick her out?

1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:10.460
I told you you don't have to repay me.

1:09:22.029 --> 1:09:23.029
I'd rather

1:09:24.069 --> 1:09:26.529
you buy me a meal for real some time.

1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:30.220
That will never happen.

1:09:30.580 --> 1:09:31.300
Goodbye.

1:09:32.950 --> 1:09:34.819
Are you going to disband us?

1:09:36.100 --> 1:09:37.800
Why are you asking me that?

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.970
I heard you were planning to.

1:09:39.970 --> 1:09:42.000
That's for CEO Ma to decide.

1:09:42.390 --> 1:09:44.840
As an investor and Management HQ director,

1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:46.520
I advised him to do that.

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:50.420
Then you can give him different advice.

1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:51.420
Like what?

1:09:51.689 --> 1:09:53.689
Give our team one more chance.

1:09:53.930 --> 1:09:54.930
A chance?

1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:56.750
A chance is given

1:09:56.770 --> 1:10:00.150
to those who can actually succeed.

1:10:00.650 --> 1:10:01.780
But you don't know us...

1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:04.240
Meeting me this way is not good.

1:10:04.550 --> 1:10:07.260
I wasn't pleased when you asked to borrow money.

1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:08.940
But I can overlook it.

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:10.080
That is

1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:12.050
the kind of chance I give.

1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:15.100
Because I'm not that cold-blooded.

1:10:19.220 --> 1:10:21.570
You should've stopped then.

1:10:21.810 --> 1:10:23.900
When I told you you didn't have to repay me.

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:40.040
Hello?

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:41.100
Hi, Elle.

1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:43.230
We got the soundtrack. Can you come later?

1:10:43.230 --> 1:10:44.310
The music director will come, too.

1:10:45.070 --> 1:10:46.070
Oh.

1:10:46.630 --> 1:10:47.460
Okay.

1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:18.550
Okay!

1:11:19.940 --> 1:11:21.300
Hey, this part...

1:11:21.470 --> 1:11:22.800
- Whatever.
- Come over here.

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:23.780
- No.
- Come on.

1:11:23.810 --> 1:11:25.810
Let's first get it right.

1:11:29.730 --> 1:11:31.720
The chicken that crashed the live show.

1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:32.690
It was you, right?

1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:34.300
Huh?

1:11:34.650 --> 1:11:35.610
Jeez.

1:11:36.470 --> 1:11:38.370
You know how freaked out I was?

1:11:38.820 --> 1:11:40.270
It was a good idea,

1:11:40.270 --> 1:11:41.920
but some people are sharp.

1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:43.740
They find out who you are

1:11:43.740 --> 1:11:45.390
even through reflections on a spoon.

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:48.140
Because of Hyun-ji, they let the chicken slide.

1:11:48.860 --> 1:11:49.980
Isn't that a relief?

1:11:51.170 --> 1:11:53.170
But I'm mad they let it slide.

1:11:53.490 --> 1:11:54.690
I guess it's an occupational hazard.

1:11:55.530 --> 1:11:57.770
Of course, we can't complain when Cotton Candy

1:11:57.770 --> 1:12:00.830
didn't make the gossip column after all that.

1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:02.450
Why did she do that?

1:12:03.260 --> 1:12:04.530
I don't know.

1:12:08.570 --> 1:12:09.570
Okay!

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:10.930
Let's go again.

1:12:10.930 --> 1:12:11.750
Okay.

1:12:11.750 --> 1:12:12.740
Wait.

1:12:13.050 --> 1:12:14.790
I'm pooped. Let's get something sweet.

1:12:14.850 --> 1:12:16.370
Why? I'm on a roll.

1:12:16.530 --> 1:12:17.660
One more, then a break.

1:12:17.660 --> 1:12:18.260
No.

1:12:18.650 --> 1:12:19.420
Don't.

1:12:19.730 --> 1:12:21.070
So suddenly?

1:12:21.330 --> 1:12:22.030
Let's go.

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:23.730
- Let's go, let's go.
- For real?

1:12:23.730 --> 1:12:25.210
- You can drink water...
- No, let's go.

1:12:25.510 --> 1:12:27.030
Let's go. Let's go.

1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:30.910
I'll make a quick call, then join you.

1:12:30.910 --> 1:12:31.890
Order a latte for me

1:12:31.890 --> 1:12:33.270
with a lot of syrup in it.

1:12:33.690 --> 1:12:34.790
Let's make it quick.

1:12:34.790 --> 1:12:35.790
Thanks.

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:45.520
Come out, Du-ho.

1:12:47.270 --> 1:12:48.550
I said come out.

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:50.000
No one's here.

1:13:04.250 --> 1:13:06.050
How long were you in there?

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:08.360
Ji-han...

1:13:09.370 --> 1:13:10.370
Get out.

1:13:13.630 --> 1:13:14.630
Wait.

1:13:15.190 --> 1:13:16.350
Ji-han...

1:13:17.550 --> 1:13:19.480
I won't lock the doors when I leave.

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:23.480
You must've skipped dinner.

1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:27.500
We'll be practicing for another hour.

1:13:31.330 --> 1:13:32.330
Ji-han!

1:13:33.130 --> 1:13:34.130
Thank you.

1:13:34.820 --> 1:13:36.260
Thank you so much!

1:13:44.590 --> 1:13:46.220
You have to do it like this.

1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:47.580
Not like this, but like this.

1:13:47.580 --> 1:13:49.100
Your hair is doing all the work.

1:13:49.100 --> 1:13:50.110
Seriously.

1:13:50.110 --> 1:13:51.340
Even a bear can roll over.

1:13:51.340 --> 1:13:53.710
He did his job as an agent well this time.

1:13:54.490 --> 1:13:55.770
Huh? It's Du-ho.

1:13:56.220 --> 1:13:57.220
Du-ho!

1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:00.490
Hey, guys!

1:14:01.650 --> 1:14:03.770
Is that a person or a boar?

1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:07.540
When we make a comeback, let's ditch him.

1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:08.650
The agent should look cool

1:14:08.650 --> 1:14:10.480
for the artist to look cool.

1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:12.310
Let's ask for Edward.

1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:18.470
Seriously.

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:23.240
Did that just fall off?

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:25.660
I put it together with super glue.

1:14:26.630 --> 1:14:28.130
Jeez.

1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:30.390
Hyun-ji!

1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:32.320
I tried to sort things out.

1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:33.620
How?

1:14:33.930 --> 1:14:35.570
I tried to get

1:14:36.230 --> 1:14:37.230
another gig

1:14:37.660 --> 1:14:40.460
other than Jicheon Marketplace.

1:14:40.990 --> 1:14:42.230
That's nonsense!

1:14:42.870 --> 1:14:44.260
Right. So it didn't work out.

1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:45.500
I failed.

1:14:45.870 --> 1:14:47.970
They're called

1:14:48.670 --> 1:14:51.480
"Jicheon Marketplace National Singing Contest."

1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:53.710
I asked them to take out "marketplace."

1:14:53.710 --> 1:14:55.180
They printed everything out, so they said no.

1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:57.250
Are you kidding me?

1:14:57.350 --> 1:14:58.550
So I asked them

1:14:58.550 --> 1:15:01.950
to at least change the words on the banner.

1:15:01.950 --> 1:15:03.390
To take out "marketplace."

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:06.360
They said yes.

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:09.130
I pestered them so bad.

1:15:09.290 --> 1:15:10.730
So even if

1:15:10.900 --> 1:15:13.230
you don't like it, I hope you can let it slide.

1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:14.670
From now on,

1:15:14.670 --> 1:15:15.830
I will never

1:15:15.830 --> 1:15:17.770
get a gig in the marketplace.

1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:19.380
Don't be mad.

1:15:19.770 --> 1:15:21.340
- Whatever.
- I'm sorry.

1:15:21.340 --> 1:15:22.970
Hyun-ji!

1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:05.750
It's not like I have

1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:08.920
high hopes for this gig.

1:16:12.490 --> 1:16:13.490
But

1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:17.060
I feel terrible about what I did to Jenna.

1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:21.660
So I'm going to do my best.

1:16:25.100 --> 1:16:26.200
Elle.

1:16:28.670 --> 1:16:30.610
I know you haven't voted yet.

1:16:39.980 --> 1:16:40.980
Huh?

1:16:41.420 --> 1:16:42.820
I'm on my way.

1:16:41.450 --> 1:16:42.650
Elle

1:16:51.300 --> 1:16:53.560
Elle is coming!

1:16:54.230 --> 1:16:55.270
Really?

1:16:55.870 --> 1:16:57.070
Don't lie.

1:16:57.440 --> 1:16:59.140
She's on her way now.

1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:00.600
What? Awesome.

1:17:03.110 --> 1:17:04.210
I'll be going now.

1:17:07.650 --> 1:17:08.710
Hello.

1:17:08.710 --> 1:17:10.880
It's been a long time.

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:12.150
Was there a job here?

1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:13.280
Yes.

1:17:13.850 --> 1:17:14.890
A soundtrack?

1:17:15.350 --> 1:17:16.350
Yes.

1:17:16.420 --> 1:17:17.390
Okay.

1:17:17.390 --> 1:17:18.460
Director!

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:19.890
Yes?

1:17:21.330 --> 1:17:22.590
Has CEO Ma

1:17:23.530 --> 1:17:25.700
not mentioned our comeback?

1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:26.660
Comeback?

1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:30.970
Didn't Jenna tell you?

1:17:31.770 --> 1:17:32.700
Huh?

1:17:33.370 --> 1:17:34.540
Tell me what?

1:17:34.540 --> 1:17:36.310
I don't believe her.

1:17:43.250 --> 1:17:44.750
Your contract won't be renewed.

1:17:45.350 --> 1:17:46.750
You'll be disbanded.

1:17:46.950 --> 1:17:49.150
CEO Ma said he finished talking with Jenna.

1:17:49.150 --> 1:17:50.290
She didn't tell you?

1:18:03.470 --> 1:18:05.700
Why go back to the office all of a sudden?

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.140
Will it take long?

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:09.140
Want us to wait?

1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:10.610
No. You can go.

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:11.710
Huh?

1:18:11.710 --> 1:18:13.380
Isn't that Elle from Cotton Candy?

1:18:23.890 --> 1:18:24.920
- Chae-ah.
- Huh?

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:26.090
I don't think our uniform will fit.

1:18:26.090 --> 1:18:27.960
Did you gain weight?

1:18:29.330 --> 1:18:31.500
No, I didn't.

1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:33.160
You're so cute.

1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:34.400
See?

1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:35.930
I'm glad Elle is coming.

1:18:35.930 --> 1:18:37.970
No one can sing Elle's part, right?

1:18:37.970 --> 1:18:38.840
But

1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:40.810
why did she change her mind?

1:18:40.810 --> 1:18:42.870
Right. What changed her mind?

1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:57.720
Huh?

1:18:57.790 --> 1:18:58.920
Elle!

1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:00.060
Hey.

1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:08.230
I brought comfortable clothes, just in case.

1:19:09.370 --> 1:19:10.230
Hold on.

1:19:10.230 --> 1:19:12.270
It's so good all of us are here.

1:19:14.310 --> 1:19:15.990
I heard we're disbanding.

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:28.150
I heard CEO Ma informed you.

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:31.690
Wha...what is she saying?

1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:33.590
Jenna...

1:19:33.590 --> 1:19:34.730
Jenna?

1:19:36.290 --> 1:19:38.200
He's disbanding us.

1:19:38.530 --> 1:19:39.530
But you...

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.300
He's keeping you.

1:19:48.170 --> 1:19:49.740
Just her?

1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:53.940
Why won't you answer me?

1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:57.350
Why can't you answer?

1:20:00.990 --> 1:20:02.050
Jenna...

1:20:08.690 --> 1:20:09.990
Is it true or not?

1:20:13.830 --> 1:20:15.830
Kim Jenna!

1:20:52.670 --> 1:20:54.410
We thank Kim Byeong-joon and Im Seo-won
for their special appearance

1:21:12.430 --> 1:21:14.930
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:21:14.990 --> 1:21:17.060
Were you worried we'd sabotage you staying?

1:21:17.060 --> 1:21:17.900
You're disbanding us?

1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:19.930
Give me one more chance, Sir.

1:21:19.930 --> 1:21:23.470
It means we're going back to those crappy days!

1:21:23.470 --> 1:21:25.300
Blaming me.

1:21:25.300 --> 1:21:26.840
That's all you do.

1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:28.640
If I obediently take this song,

1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:29.510
what will you do for me?

1:21:29.510 --> 1:21:31.410
There's only one person who has the right

1:21:31.410 --> 1:21:32.840
to determine the future of our group.

1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:34.610
Sir, please give us another chance.

1:21:34.610 --> 1:21:35.650
Give them another chance.

1:21:35.650 --> 1:21:37.680
You can do it.
