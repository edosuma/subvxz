13:21.760 --> 13:25.760
We're staging a parallel protest against
the US bombing of Libya last night.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.280
I don't know if I'll be done in time.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.880
I'll bring the car back.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.000
So you have it for the protest.
I'll pick you up later.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.200
-Does that make things easier?
-It's a great idea.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.480
Thank you.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.560
-Thank you. Thanks.
-See you later.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.040
Bye.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.800
♪♪

14:11.960 --> 14:13.000
Should I drive?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
(Phone rings)

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
Schneider speaking.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.680
You won't believe who just showed up here.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
Kolibri.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.880
He's been hiding out
at Thomas Posimski's place.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.080
Why would he do that?

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
Maybe...

14:42.040 --> 14:43.240
he wants to come home.

14:43.680 --> 14:44.880
That's impossible.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
This is my life.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
And my son...

14:47.360 --> 14:49.000
I'll see him again later.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.320
If I'm lucky,

14:50.720 --> 14:52.440
I'll find out more.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.800
Keep me posted.

14:55.680 --> 15:00.120
Comrades, because of the high alert,
we've suspended task force meetings.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.760
But despite the brutal attack

15:02.840 --> 15:06.360
on our Libyan brothers
in Tripoli and Benghazi,

15:06.440 --> 15:08.800
we must get back to business.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.280
War is also business.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.400
One bright detail
has emerged from the news last night.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.680
Excuse me.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.600
Reagan's henchmen
sent in 38 bomber planes.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.560
One was shot down

15:21.640 --> 15:26.720
by a B-LR Wespe missile
from the shipment we sold to the Libyans.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.840
Which is a roundabout way
of introducing Lenora Rauch,

15:30.920 --> 15:32.120
our top agent,

15:32.360 --> 15:34.080
who arranged the sale.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.440
2,137,000 Deutschmarks!

15:44.160 --> 15:46.680
I'd like to congratulate you personally,

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
Comrade Rauch.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.800
Your services to our country
are priceless.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.520
Comrade Rauch was not alone.

16:02.600 --> 16:07.680
Another member of our family
plays an important role in this deal.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.920
Kolibri.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.800
(exhales)

16:11.000 --> 16:12.920
Do you want to say anything

16:13.000 --> 16:14.560
to the Special Commission?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.000
Special Commission?

16:19.640 --> 16:23.840
Our interdisciplinary working group
here, HVA and KoKo.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
Gladly.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.320
Dear Comrades,

16:33.520 --> 16:36.680
after a long and hard-pressed time
in Cape Town,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.800
I am glad to see familiar faces again.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.520
And unfamiliar ones.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.560
We all know what compromises
must be made in this difficult time.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.680
Bitter moral compromises such as
dealing arms from West Germany

16:50.760 --> 16:52.720
to the South African Apartheid regime.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.240
But now,

16:55.640 --> 16:56.880
here at home,

16:58.040 --> 17:00.760
in the epicenter of our ideals,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.480
we never lose sight

17:03.640 --> 17:05.080
of our ultimate goal:

17:06.640 --> 17:07.640
the victory of Communism.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.920
The money came through.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.080
The Libyans. They paid in full.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
Good news.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.960
Above all, I'm grateful for
the technological support of the HVA

17:23.280 --> 17:24.920
and, of course, the KoKo

17:25.160 --> 17:26.800
with Operation Vula.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.520
Thank you, Comrade Rauch.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.520
Next on the agenda,

17:31.600 --> 17:33.920
what news do we have
regarding Operation Atlantic?

17:35.240 --> 17:38.160
Actually, it's Operation Love Boat now.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.200
One question:

17:41.400 --> 17:42.560
Where's Kolibri now?

17:43.680 --> 17:46.560
Let's catch up on family gossip later,
Comrade Rauch.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.440
The purpose of this meeting
is to review the numbers.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.200
May I begin?

17:51.640 --> 17:53.000
Of course, Comrade Schneider.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.680
The Beroxalin Trial continues apace
after initial complications.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.640
We are on track to finish up in two weeks,

18:01.720 --> 18:03.920
when we will be paid in full.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.720
Herr Amend has been very pleased
with our work so far.

18:06.800 --> 18:12.640
And in related business,
it was a banner week for blood sales.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.160
West Berlin hospitals cleaned us out.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.400
(knocking on table)

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
(door opens)

18:36.760 --> 18:38.160
-Where's Martin?
-Uh-uh.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
(Sighs)

18:44.520 --> 18:46.080
Well. He didn't die in Angola.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.160
Apparently he went from Angola to Libya,
then to Paris.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.760
With the weapons, without your help.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Just like I got back into the inner circle
without your help.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.400
But not without
rearranging your worldview!

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
(Inhales)

18:59.200 --> 19:02.800
The night of the attack, Martin flew
to West Berlin using a fake British ID.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.840
He was targeted there
by western intelligence services

19:07.800 --> 19:09.280
as a possible accomplice.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.840
And I was so sure he was...

19:25.680 --> 19:28.240
(Inhales and exhales)

19:32.440 --> 19:34.480

24:35.840 --> 24:36.840
Hmm.

A hundred thousand dollars?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.360
It might surprise you,
but we have other projects on our agenda

24:57.440 --> 24:59.840
beyond the ANC leadership's
communication goals in South Africa.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.120
I assured the ANC
of our support on Operation Vula.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.240
Their agent Rose Seithanti
came to Berlin for this.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.720
The ANC

25:09.200 --> 25:10.600
was instrumental

25:10.760 --> 25:12.280
in the last deal

25:12.560 --> 25:14.120
we did with the SADF.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.400
Don't be ridiculous now.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.280
Since when does the ANC
do favors for the SADF?

25:19.360 --> 25:21.040
The South African army is its archenemy!

25:21.240 --> 25:24.400
Since when does East Germany do business
with its archenemy, West Germany?

25:24.480 --> 25:27.080
Since we have no choice, Comrade Rauch.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.560
You always have a choice.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.920
I have an idea.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.320
You help us make
Operation Love Boat a success,

25:40.920 --> 25:43.080
and we'll revisit the 100,000
for Operation Vula.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.480
What exactly is Operation Love Boat?

25:46.920 --> 25:51.480
We use our new cruise ship,
on which Rose will be traveling,

25:51.560 --> 25:53.640
as a vessel. Call it a Trojan horse.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.360
To deliver weapons to Cape Town.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.320
While the distinguished workers
of East Germany

25:58.400 --> 26:00.040
sail around the Cape of Good Hope.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120

26:07.720 --> 26:08.840
Comrade Dietrich,

26:09.320 --> 26:10.680
you have managed

26:11.040 --> 26:15.360
to turn our Socialist organization

26:15.920 --> 26:17.920
into a kind of capitalist mafia.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.480
I wonder what motivates you.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.840
Don't you care about socialist ideals?
About creating a better world?

26:26.080 --> 26:27.440
Or only about money?

26:30.480 --> 26:31.800
I don't see any contradiction.

26:34.480 --> 26:38.240
Maybe you'll find other ways
to raise money for the ANC.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.600
Yes, I'm going to West Berlin
in a few days.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.280
There are people who support
the struggle against apartheid

26:46.360 --> 26:49.080
out of sheer conviction,
without strings attached.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.240
Oh, right.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.440
Martin showed up at Tischbier's.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.360
I won't stay long.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.360
Just tell the HVA they can bring me over.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.720
I have a lot to tell them.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.240
You just scored a big win for us in Libya.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.000
Why come back now?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.720
If it were up to me,
I would have gone home much earlier.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.000
But instead you shacked up
with a BND agent in Paris for six weeks.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.920
You never know
when she might come in handy.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Hmm.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.640
Ah.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.280
How's Alex?

29:01.120 --> 29:02.880
Why should we trust you?

29:04.400 --> 29:06.560
