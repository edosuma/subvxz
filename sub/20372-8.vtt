09:29.610 --> 09:30.862
She hates being called that.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.740
I kind of like the way that she says it.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.326
Okay, you can stop blowing my mom now, Isabelle.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.286
Emma Christine Seaver!

09:38.370 --> 09:40.288
Still not her name.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.541
Okay, I get it, Mom.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.418
I know what you're doing. I don't cook,

09:44.501 --> 09:48.255
and I can't have babies the normal way -- I hear you.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.382
Isabelle, I pulled together everything healthy

09:50.465 --> 09:52.426
I could find in these paper bags.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.386
Thank you.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.471
You know what, Rita?

09:56.555 --> 09:58.056
My favorite thing that you've ever whipped up

09:58.139 --> 10:01.809
is that girl over there.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.186
So gay.

10:06.731 --> 10:11.486
She made this box a home for me.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.322
First one of my whole life.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.368
You grew up homeless like that Justin Beaver kid?

10:18.452 --> 10:19.327
How did we not know that?

10:19.411 --> 10:21.413
Justin Beaver.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.040
So good. Go on.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.417
No, I mean, I-I had a house.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.252
I grew up in a house, but not a home.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.797
We don't all have to hold hands

10:30.880 --> 10:33.091
and get queer over this, do we?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.387
Dad.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.181
So, Jack, anything around this home of yours

10:40.265 --> 10:43.310
you need a real man to fix while I'm here?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.895
You know what, Hal? I am an expert

10:45.979 --> 10:47.981
at finding precisely the right professional

10:48.064 --> 10:49.816
for everything I need.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.193
It's very true. I can personally attest to that.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.699
As a surrogate.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.202
Of course as a surrogate. What else would you mean?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.829
No offense, but --

11:02.912 --> 11:04.372
Oh, this should be good.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.749
If you two had started working on this at 24

11:06.833 --> 11:08.126
like normal people,

11:08.209 --> 11:10.462
you wouldn't need professional assistance.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.340
We hadn't even met then, so we couldn't have started at 24.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.091
No, you or somebody better.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.511
Maybe a man who doesn't pull a hamstring

11:17.594 --> 11:19.720
changing a lightbulb.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.640
That's an incredibly reductive version

11:21.722 --> 11:24.476
of a highly complex incident.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.439
Like, the ladder was extremely high

11:29.523 --> 11:31.399
and winds were gusting that day.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.318
Fierce winds. I thought he was kidding.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.195
That actually happened?

11:37.113 --> 11:38.448
Could've happened to anyone.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.787
That's not that funny.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.665
Glad you all find

11:46.747 --> 11:48.583
my lack of mundane masculine acumen

11:48.667 --> 11:51.044
so amusing.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.338
"Masculine acumen"

11:56.299 --> 11:57.884
I'm not laughing. No.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.643
Okay, after 100 years of marriage,

12:06.725 --> 12:08.687
that still blinded me in one eye.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.614
When did drugs become so scary?

12:19.698 --> 12:21.533
When did they stop being kind and happy?

12:21.616 --> 12:24.118
Yeah. You know, I'm thinking maybe when we added a mortgage

12:24.202 --> 12:28.164
and a couple needy little humans to the mix.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.626
We're grown-ups for the rest of our lives.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.045
Oh, my God, that's fucking terrifying.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.755
Okay, so I'm just gonna...

12:36.839 --> 12:38.091
help you.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.343
Gonna put it -- put it on.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.053
Yeah, you don't have to help me. That's fine.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.723
Just -- Just do what you're doing.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.391
: Underwear up!

12:46.474 --> 12:49.269
Just gonna lift your leg through there.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.769
That's good stuff. You can put it down.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.939
Thank you. Okay.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.899
Always wanted three kids.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.150
There we go.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.236
In you go, in you go, yeah.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.362
There we go.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.197
Okay, you ready?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.823
Now underneath and bottoms up.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.618
Yeah, that's awesome.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.952
Thank you, thank you.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.579
All right. Wedgie.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.997
Good boy.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.334
Is this a sex thing?

13:13.418 --> 13:15.211
Absolutely not. Okay, good,

13:15.295 --> 13:17.547
'cause it's weird and disturbing.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.217
And we're just not.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.385
Hmm.

13:24.220 --> 13:29.016
We're suburban parents living in the suburbs.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.311
Who occasionally become redundant?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.772
What? Never mind.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.150
The point is we're us.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.027
We're Dave and Carmen.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.739
We're exactly who we are.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.370
You know what?

13:49.454 --> 13:51.038
What?

13:52.707 --> 13:54.875
I'm going to embrace the predictability

13:54.959 --> 13:57.378
of chain restaurants

13:57.462 --> 13:59.631
and the convenience of cargo shorts.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.635
I'm going to wear cargo shorts to Applebee's

14:03.718 --> 14:06.721
and be completely actualized.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.846
We didn't sell out.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.223
It wasn't an accident,

14:09.307 --> 14:11.100
and we don't owe anybody an apology.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.893
No. Fuck 'em, right?

14:12.977 --> 14:14.187
Fuck 'em.

Whoever them are.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.898
Whoever them is.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.150
Whomever.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.860
Whomever is them.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.236
Well said, sweetie.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.991
Oh, my God.

14:27.826 --> 14:28.868
Oh, my God.

Okay.

The "woman to woman thing"? We all lock vaginas

16:45.338 --> 16:48.299
Oh. I get it.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.551
You're the reigning Miss Forever and Ever.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.637
Has he swept you away to Crystal Cove yet?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.138
Crystal Cove?

16:54.221 --> 16:55.723
He's got a line on a beach cabin.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.391
Roaring fireplace,

16:57.475 --> 16:58.935
crashing waves, et cetera.

If that dude's accumulated one full day as a single man

17:01.187 --> 17:03.356
in his adult life, I'd be surprised.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.941
It's all about the beginnings.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.860
Seduction, courtship.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.487
That magic time before asking for a 10-minute foot massage

17:09.570 --> 17:11.280
becomes a prolonged negotiation.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.199
When you stare deep into each other's souls

17:13.282 --> 17:16.494
and eat your way through Twizzlers to

17:13.282 --> 17:16.494
each other's mouths

17:16.577 --> 17:18.579
and make up embarrassingly

17:16.577 --> 17:18.579
cute names

17:18.663 --> 17:21.248

so we'll just put a pin in that and I'll go first.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.766
I used my humiliating time-out

23:12.850 --> 23:14.352
to do some deep thinking,

23:14.434 --> 23:16.770
and here's what I came to.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.232
Like you said, this is your home.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.317
Emma and Jack's home.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.485
But it'll never be mine,

23:23.569 --> 23:25.321
and it's not just because of the poop candles

23:25.403 --> 23:26.780
or being surrounded by your friends

23:26.864 --> 23:28.406
who will always be secretly waiting

23:28.490 --> 23:30.326
for me to pack up and move on

23:30.408 --> 23:34.621
so you guys can go back to the way things were.

23:34.705 --> 23:35.622
What are you saying?

23:35.706 --> 23:37.833
I'm...

23:37.917 --> 23:42.046
I'm saying that I want to live in our home.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.006
Not yours.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.016
Okay, now it's your turn.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.976
And tell me what you were actually talking about.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.354
But fair warning, if you guys break up with me again,

23:58.436 --> 24:00.106
I'm gonna use those shit candles of yours

24:00.189 --> 24:01.899
to burn down this entire neighborhood.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.988
We want you to have our baby.

Huh?

24:25.547 --> 24:26.882
Sorry.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.592
I think I blacked out a little.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.678

24:28.675 --> 24:31.678
before you came in.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.347
I don't know how serious he is.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.849
How serious are you? I mean, what's the

24:33.431 --> 24:35.849
other option?

24:35.933 --> 24:39.145
To bring in a fourth person into our relationship?

24:39.228 --> 24:41.981
You, me, her, and a baby vessel.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.733
Are we talking, like, a year from now or...

24:44.817 --> 24:46.193
No.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.154
I mean, 40's gonna happen like that, you know,

24:48.237 --> 24:52.450
and as long as we're laying our cards on the table, Em,

24:52.532 --> 24:55.077
I want children, plural.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.787
I don't want to be one of those dads

24:56.870 --> 24:58.372
that's breaking a hip playing Horse

24:58.456 --> 25:00.582
with his youngest son in the driveway.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.960
You sound serious.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.586
I think I am.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.135
Feels like my heart

25:11.218 --> 25:12.886

25:16.765 --> 25:18.892

25:18.976 --> 25:21.479
like we're supposed to do this together.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.064
No? I know.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.942
Yeah, but, um...

25:27.026 --> 25:30.154
you're a grad student in your mid-20s,

25:30.237 --> 25:33.366
and you've recently equated the suburbs with human feces.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.575
Well, there's no law that says every child

25:35.659 --> 25:38.162
has to be raised within a half-mile of a Chili's

25:38.245 --> 25:40.456
or a World Market.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.666

25:47.046 --> 25:48.546
hit the brakes just a little?

25:58.556 --> 26:00.976
Mom, don't jump to any conclusions.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.604
Okay, let's just agree I've been sleepwalking here,

26:04.688 --> 26:07.691
and I'm just gonna wander off

26:07.774 --> 26:10.319
