01:17.410 --> 01:20.478
How you doing?

01:20.479 --> 01:22.181
I got it!

01:22.182 --> 01:24.349
Pull up next to the limo.

01:47.189 --> 01:49.858
- Natalie.
- Nice to see you.

01:51.627 --> 01:53.695
Pardon my incredulity,
natalie,

01:53.696 --> 01:55.630
But I'm very surprised
to see you here-

01:55.631 --> 01:57.466
Pleasantly so, of course.

01:57.467 --> 01:58.834
I'm a little surprised

01:58.835 --> 02:01.035
To see myself here,
too, mary alice-

02:01.036 --> 02:03.489
Pleasantly so,
of course.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.690
Were you here
last year?

02:05.691 --> 02:07.593
No. I wasn't
invited last year.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.294
Oh. Curious.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.197
That must have been
an accident.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.303
Oh,
do you know libby?

02:18.304 --> 02:19.854
No, I don't
believe I do.

02:19.855 --> 02:22.024
<i>Libby, this
is natalie standish.</i>

02:22.025 --> 02:24.025
Natalie is reed's-

02:24.026 --> 02:26.561
Oh, is it
all right to, um...

02:27.813 --> 02:29.615
Say that reed
got me pregnant

02:29.616 --> 02:32.884
When I was a bar hop at your country
club, married me to avoid scandal,

02:32.885 --> 02:35.220
Spent the next 10 years
sucking the life out of me,

02:35.221 --> 02:36.888
Got bored with me,
dumped me

02:36.889 --> 02:39.591
And screwed me in court?
Sure. Go ahead.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.531
natalie is reed's ex-wife.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.798
Oh.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.700
Libby percy holt.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.336
Natalie werjachewski
standish.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.439
Well, are you
unescorted tonight?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.241
No, I'm with someone.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.710
A friend. Male.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.696
Well... If the new
fella comes by,

03:01.697 --> 03:03.498
Be sure and point
him out to us.

03:03.499 --> 03:05.284
Oh, I don't think
I'll have to do that.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.352
You'll know him
when you see him.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.446
Oh, great! Aah!

03:41.103 --> 03:43.021
Go on!
Get out of here!

03:43.022 --> 03:46.325
<i>Get off!</i>

03:50.496 --> 03:53.932
feisty little guy.

04:16.305 --> 04:18.240
I don't care for caviar.

04:18.241 --> 04:20.041
I make it a rule
never to eat anything

04:20.041 --> 04:23.311
A fish deposits
in a riverbed. Right?

04:25.248 --> 04:27.649
It's been awfully nice
meeting you...

04:27.650 --> 04:29.717
<i>- Dutch.
- Indeed.</i>

04:33.573 --> 04:35.507
Nice meeting you.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.579
Hi. I missed you.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.014
Hello, natalie.

05:01.150 --> 05:04.686
- Reed standish.
- Dutch dooley.

05:05.988 --> 05:08.256
You look... Great.

05:08.257 --> 05:10.258
I didn't expect
to see you here.

05:10.259 --> 05:12.827
I didn't expect to see you,
either. I thought you were

05:12.828 --> 05:15.430
- Going down to spend time with doyle.
- Something came up.

05:15.431 --> 05:17.065
I have to go to london
in the morning.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.733
How does doyle
feel about that?

05:18.734 --> 05:21.269
I haven't been able
to reach him yet.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.405
You'll be talking to him.
You can tell him.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.807
You haven't told him
you're not coming?

05:29.445 --> 05:31.045
I'm sorry.

05:31.046 --> 05:33.715
Could you excuse us?
This is personal.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.291
Where the hell
did you find him?

05:43.292 --> 05:44.892
Look, you can
call doyle, okay?

05:44.893 --> 05:47.262
I'm tired of doing
your dirty work for you.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.730
I'm being very nice to you.

05:48.731 --> 05:50.532
I gave you a house
to live in,

05:50.533 --> 05:52.900
- With your truck driver.
- He's not a truck driver.

05:52.901 --> 05:55.604
Don't interrupt. You get a
monthly check, a house to live in,

05:55.605 --> 05:57.872
<i>And you get
joint custody of doyle.</i>

05:57.873 --> 06:00.908
You give me a hard time,
you lose it all.

06:00.909 --> 06:03.111
You wouldn't dare
play fair, would you?

06:03.112 --> 06:05.380
I wouldn't dare lose.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.618
Have a nice holiday.

06:13.422 --> 06:15.089
Excuse me.

06:15.090 --> 06:17.559
I know what you were saying
to natalie was personal.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.994
I understand.
I'm involved with her now,

06:19.995 --> 06:22.430
So this is personal, too.

06:22.431 --> 06:24.899
You hurt her, and I'll
hit you so fucking hard,

06:24.900 --> 06:27.068
Your dog will bleed, okay?

06:29.505 --> 06:31.573
Nice meeting you.

06:41.416 --> 06:44.702
I just feel weak
and used.

06:44.703 --> 06:46.571
He took you
out of your life,

06:46.572 --> 06:49.274
Put you in his,
and took off.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.243
I mean,
you don't need him,

06:51.244 --> 06:54.479
His house, his money
or his friends.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.148
Make it on your own.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.951
There's only one thing
he has that I want.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.953
What the heck
would you do with a set

07:01.954 --> 07:04.822
Of tiny little genitals?

07:09.328 --> 07:11.729
- I'm being serious.
- I'm sorry.

07:17.736 --> 07:20.989
He has my son.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.479
<i>- Boy: Hello?
- I'd like to speak to doyle standish, please.</i>

07:45.480 --> 07:47.415
Oh.

07:47.416 --> 07:49.951
Yeah. Hold on.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.815
Doyle.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.687
<i>Doyle.</i>

08:13.893 --> 08:16.027
Do you know
how to knock?

08:16.028 --> 08:19.230
<i>- Your ma's on the phone.
- Do you know how to knock?</i>

08:20.299 --> 08:22.300
The door was open.

08:22.301 --> 08:26.138
<i>It wasn't open.
It was unlocked.</i>

08:26.139 --> 08:30.458
<i>Someone from any sort of
decent background would knock.</i>

08:30.459 --> 08:34.011
<i>And she's not my ma.</i>

08:34.013 --> 08:36.780
<i>I don't have a ma.</i>

08:36.782 --> 08:39.784
<i>You may have a ma.</i>

08:39.784 --> 08:42.336
I have a mother, okay?

08:42.337 --> 08:44.406
Do you want to take
the call, shithead?

08:44.407 --> 08:47.442
I could have you
written up for profanity.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.243
Yeah? I'm terrified.

08:50.579 --> 08:52.747
I will have you
written up.

08:52.748 --> 08:54.082
Working
in the kitchen

08:54.083 --> 08:56.084
Will be good
for you, teddy.

08:56.085 --> 08:58.386
You can have a taste
of what your career

08:58.387 --> 09:00.889
At burger king
will be like.

09:04.026 --> 09:06.310
What makes you think
you're so superior?

09:06.311 --> 09:08.312
I don't have to think.

09:08.313 --> 09:10.749
It's sickening how much
you love yourself.

09:15.704 --> 09:17.138
Yeah.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.275
I guess it would be

09:20.276 --> 09:22.277
To someone
who's enrolled here

09:22.278 --> 09:25.079
Only because his father
is an employee.

09:30.002 --> 09:32.037
At least
I have a father.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.503
- Yes?
- Doyle? Hi, sweetheart.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.905
What do you want?

09:50.906 --> 09:53.525
I'm calling
about thanksgiving.

09:53.526 --> 09:57.229
<i>- What about it?
- I'd like you to come home.</i>

09:57.230 --> 10:01.165
For the umpteenth time,
I'll be with dad.

10:03.068 --> 10:05.337
Dad can't
be with you, honey.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.472
He has to go to europe.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.774
<i>He told me last night.</i>

10:09.775 --> 10:12.310
<i>So if he's made
any plans with you,</i>

10:12.311 --> 10:14.279
<i>Obviously he'll have
to break them.</i>

10:21.370 --> 10:23.938
I really want you
to come home, doyle.

10:23.939 --> 10:26.190
So you can get my approval
of your new boyfriend

10:26.191 --> 10:28.226
To appease your guilt?

10:28.227 --> 10:30.629
Look, you are old enough
to be objective

10:30.630 --> 10:32.947
About me and your father
and to understand

10:32.948 --> 10:35.216
<i>Why we're in
the situation we're in.</i>

10:35.217 --> 10:38.219
Yeah, I know.
I understand.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.221
<i>You couldn't
make it work.</i>

10:40.222 --> 10:43.824
If you could see both sides,
you'd know that that isn't true.

10:43.825 --> 10:46.727
<i>I love you, honey, and-</i>

10:46.728 --> 10:49.597
<i>And I want you home.</i>

10:49.598 --> 10:51.832
I've booked you a flight
on Wednesday,

10:51.833 --> 10:53.401
And I expect you
to be on it.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.370
Forget it!
I'm not coming home

10:55.371 --> 10:57.272
To spend a holiday
with you or the idiot

10:57.273 --> 10:59.073
You're sharing
the house with, okay?

10:59.074 --> 11:01.009
He is not sharing
a house with me,

11:01.010 --> 11:04.645
- And he is hardly
an idiot!

11:05.981 --> 11:07.949
I love you, sweetheart.

11:31.157 --> 11:34.025
A little trouble
on the home front?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.449
- Boys: Aw.
- What a jerk.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.799
You talk
to your son yet?

12:14.800 --> 12:18.102
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

12:18.103 --> 12:20.321
I don't know.
I have a ticket for him.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.123
I know he won't use it.

12:28.163 --> 12:29.864
Do you want to go down
and get him?

12:29.865 --> 12:32.533
He won't
appreciate that.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.286
How about if I go down?

12:35.287 --> 12:38.672
There's no better way for two
guys to get to know each other

12:38.673 --> 12:40.892
Than spend a couple
of days in a car.

12:44.329 --> 12:46.030
Dutch.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.466
He doesn't want
to know you.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.285
Well, from what
I can gather,

12:51.286 --> 12:53.287
All he wants to do

12:53.288 --> 12:56.557
Is sit alone in a room
and hate people.

12:56.558 --> 12:59.127
There's a fair amount
of truth in that.

12:59.128 --> 13:01.663
<i>Let me go down
and get him.</i>

13:01.664 --> 13:03.782
I'm an interested
third party.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.618
I'm a communicator.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.486
I'm a breakthrough
kind of guy.

13:08.487 --> 13:11.923
<i>I've handled some pretty
tough birds in my time.</i>

13:11.924 --> 13:15.226
And when
the smoke cleared-

13:15.227 --> 13:18.062
Almost without exception-

13:18.063 --> 13:19.997
I had a new friend.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.595
Smells good.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.131
<i>I want to do this for you.
It's important.</i>

13:37.132 --> 13:39.650
If we're going to be
together from now on,

13:39.651 --> 13:42.320
I'll have to have a good
relationship with darryl.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.826
Doyle.

14:05.861 --> 14:07.561
Doyle.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.965
What do you want?

14:10.966 --> 14:12.666
My parents
wanted to know

14:12.667 --> 14:14.401
If, since you're
not going home,

14:14.402 --> 14:17.004
You'd want to come over to
our house for thanksgiving.

14:17.005 --> 14:19.774
Don't think I could
handle that much fun.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.376
Is that a no?

14:22.377 --> 14:24.779
That's a no.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.314
Great.
Have a nice weekend

14:27.315 --> 14:30.034
Rotting in your own
pissed-off world.

14:45.267 --> 14:47.268
Peggy, it's me.
I'm at o'hare.

14:47.269 --> 14:48.936
Listen, I'm flying
down to atlanta

14:48.937 --> 14:51.372
To pick up my girlfriend's kid from school.

14:51.373 --> 14:52.874
Yeah, it came up
unexpectedly.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.876
Tell tug and fritz
I'll be incommunicado.

14:54.877 --> 14:57.945
They should take care of anything
that comes up. I'll be back on Monday.

14:57.946 --> 15:01.582
Listen, lady, don't jerk me around, okay?

15:01.583 --> 15:03.217
I have a letter from him

15:03.218 --> 15:05.486
Saying that he's going
to pick me up.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.022
Now, give me his number
in london.

15:09.324 --> 15:10.825
When my father finds out

15:10.826 --> 15:13.560
That you refused
to give me his number,

15:13.561 --> 15:14.862
You're fired.

15:32.447 --> 15:35.716
<i>¶ snatch it back
and hold it ¶</i>

15:35.717 --> 15:39.220
<i>¶ I can't help myself ¶</i>

15:39.221 --> 15:42.423
<i>¶ somebody's
got to help me ¶</i>

15:42.424 --> 15:46.394
<i>¶ 'cause I can't
help myself ¶</i>

15:46.395 --> 15:49.564
<i>¶ I'm not doing
too bad, baby ¶</i>

15:49.565 --> 15:51.999
<i>¶ you know, I ain't got
no brand-new bag ¶</i>

16:07.249 --> 16:10.784
<i>¶ a little
he-he-he-he-he-he help. ¶</i>

16:38.980 --> 16:39.913
Yo.

16:45.820 --> 16:46.954
<i>Doyle.</i>

16:52.094 --> 16:53.461
Doyle?

17:56.258 --> 17:57.191
Dad!

18:00.795 --> 18:02.230
<i>Doyle?</i>

18:04.199 --> 18:06.351
Ooh!

18:06.352 --> 18:07.818
Ooh! Aah!

18:09.355 --> 18:11.022
Ow!

18:11.023 --> 18:12.724
Ooh!

18:12.725 --> 18:13.774
Aaah!

18:13.775 --> 18:14.825
Ohh!

18:22.250 --> 18:23.417
Stand up.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.786
What the hell?

18:25.787 --> 18:28.623
I said, stand up!

18:28.624 --> 18:30.074
Hands over
your head!

18:33.928 --> 18:36.764
I don't think
you know who I am.

18:36.765 --> 18:38.883
Ow! Son of a-

18:40.019 --> 18:41.452
Ow!

18:42.671 --> 18:47.258
Give me the gun!

18:47.259 --> 18:50.227
Aah! Uhh...

18:53.599 --> 18:54.965
Uhh...

18:54.966 --> 18:55.783
Uhh!

18:55.784 --> 18:57.418
No, you don't.

18:59.588 --> 19:00.521
Sit.

19:01.924 --> 19:03.490
I'm dutch dooley.

19:03.491 --> 19:05.693
I'm a friend
of your mother's.

19:05.694 --> 19:08.413
I know she called you.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.415
What the hell are you
beating me up for?

19:15.671 --> 19:17.104
Ah, jeez.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.075
I feel the pain in my crotch in my teeth.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.461
Does campus security
know you're here?

19:25.864 --> 19:29.467
Can you say, "I'm sorry
I hit you with a golf club,

19:29.468 --> 19:32.236
Kicked your face,
mashed your testes,

19:32.237 --> 19:33.838
Shot you twice"?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.107
If that's too much,
a simple hello would do.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.008
Answer my question.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.143
You can't say that?

19:39.144 --> 19:41.078
Of course I can say it.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.087
I choose not to.

19:53.575 --> 19:55.275
Now can you?

19:55.276 --> 19:56.444
No.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.630
Well, I have to shoot you.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.700
Now, since we might be
legally related someday,

20:02.701 --> 20:05.352
I'll give you the option
of taking it on the backside.

20:05.353 --> 20:07.088
Won't hurt as bad.

20:07.089 --> 20:09.657
If you shoot me...

20:09.658 --> 20:11.659
I'll have you
arrested.

20:11.660 --> 20:14.812
Well, I'll have to make it
look like an accident, then.

20:17.949 --> 20:19.800
All right, you win.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.553
Clearly. Now leave.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.188
I told your mother I'd take
you home for the holidays.

20:24.189 --> 20:26.757
I have plans.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.543
Stay here? You're gonna
watch the football game,

20:29.544 --> 20:30.878
Make a turkey sandwich,

20:30.879 --> 20:32.680
And hang yourself
in the toilet?

20:32.681 --> 20:33.998
I said I have plans.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.167
Leave it at that.
Now please go.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.102
Waiting for your dad?

20:38.103 --> 20:40.571
I don't have to
tell you anything.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.756
He's not coming.

20:41.757 --> 20:43.223
You don't know my dad,
so shut up.

20:43.224 --> 20:44.458
I know he's in london.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.447
Is that a fact?

20:56.004 --> 20:58.305
We have a very big
problem here.

20:58.306 --> 21:01.175
Yeah. I suppose we do.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.546
I have a problem because
I said I'd pick you up.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.233
And you have a problem

21:09.234 --> 21:11.069
Because the last guy
that punched me

21:11.070 --> 21:13.104
Has a dent
in his forehead...

21:13.105 --> 21:15.606
About the size
of my pinkie ring.

21:17.342 --> 21:20.278
And he dribbles
when he smiles.

21:28.336 --> 21:30.204
Grab your stuff.

21:32.173 --> 21:36.410
Listen one last time.

21:36.411 --> 21:39.112
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

21:52.844 --> 21:54.845
What do you like to do
for fun?

21:54.846 --> 21:55.846
Mmm!

21:55.847 --> 21:57.848
Oh, you like to
wiggle and grunt.

21:57.849 --> 21:58.816
Me, too.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.837
¶ flatfoot sam
bought an automobile ¶

22:03.838 --> 22:06.740
¶ no money down,
was a real good deal ¶

22:06.741 --> 22:09.176
¶ didn't want to work,
just ride around town ¶

22:09.177 --> 22:11.745
¶ the finance company
put his feets on the ground ¶

22:11.746 --> 22:15.382
¶ old flatfoot sam,
you're always in a jam ¶

22:17.185 --> 22:19.853
¶ flatfoot sam
stole a ten-dollar bill ¶

22:19.854 --> 22:22.522
¶ he told the judge
he did it for a thrill ¶

22:22.523 --> 22:25.258
¶ he got 60 days,
suspended fine ¶

22:25.259 --> 22:27.544
¶ he thanked the jury
for being so kind ¶

22:27.545 --> 22:31.515
¶ old flatfoot sam,
you're always in a jam ¶

22:35.553 --> 22:36.837
I like the back roads.

22:38.006 --> 22:39.707
The only thing you see
on the interstate

22:39.708 --> 22:40.841
Is concrete.

22:44.512 --> 22:46.347
You warm enough
back there?

22:46.348 --> 22:47.948
Mmm!

22:47.949 --> 22:50.284
You know,
I owe you an apology.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.037
I lost my temper,
and I shouldn't have.

22:54.038 --> 22:55.373
I was a little crazy.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.107
I wasn't thinking
too clear, so...

22:58.459 --> 23:00.894
I'm not 100% sure
those undershorts

23:00.895 --> 23:02.796
I jammed in your mouth
to shut you up

23:02.797 --> 23:04.181
Were clean or not.

23:04.182 --> 23:05.949
Uhh!

23:05.950 --> 23:08.019
Stop the car.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.620
I don't think
that's a good idea.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.622
This is only a 2-lane.
That's a soft shoulder.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.557
I said, stop the car!

23:18.045 --> 23:19.946
Uhh!

23:19.947 --> 23:20.881
Ohh.

23:30.224 --> 23:32.059
Ohh...

23:34.328 --> 23:36.547
You can't beat a ford
for good brakes.

23:36.548 --> 23:38.965
I'm gonna have you
prosecuted for this.

23:38.966 --> 23:41.018
You mean like
in big people's court

23:41.019 --> 23:44.438
Or some school teen court,
where if I'm found guilty

23:44.439 --> 23:47.941
I got to roll
naked in the snow or...

23:47.942 --> 23:50.444
Make a bed with my teeth?

23:50.445 --> 23:52.446
My father is one of
the most powerful men

23:52.447 --> 23:54.881
In the country.

23:54.882 --> 23:56.784
When he hears
what you did to me,

23:56.785 --> 23:59.252
He'll sue your
working-class ass

23:59.253 --> 24:02.105
Into complete
and total destitution.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.588
How do you know
I'm working class?

24:17.589 --> 24:20.223
From your cheap shoes

24:20.224 --> 24:22.192
To your ridiculous
hairstyle

24:22.193 --> 24:25.463
To your crude vocabulary

24:25.464 --> 24:27.598
To my mother's
taste in men...

24:29.033 --> 24:30.300
You scream it.

24:30.301 --> 24:32.703
Oh. All right.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.472
Is working class bad?

24:37.041 --> 24:39.577
If you want to get into
a political discussion,

24:39.578 --> 24:40.678
I'll shred you.

24:40.679 --> 24:44.582
No. It's not bad.

24:44.583 --> 24:48.151
A solid economy
needs hand workers.

24:48.152 --> 24:51.154
Well, I used to drive
a cement truck.

24:51.155 --> 24:54.324
My father
was a bricklayer.

24:54.325 --> 24:57.094
My mother used to work
in the laundry

24:57.095 --> 24:59.229
At the pontchartrain
hotel in detroit.

24:59.230 --> 25:02.065
You must be very proud.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.136
I am.

25:07.905 --> 25:10.374
I still owe you
that shot in the ass,

25:10.375 --> 25:12.409
If you want
to get it over with.

25:12.410 --> 25:13.594
In case it's gnawing
on your mind.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.264
You know, you might be
the toughest

25:17.265 --> 25:19.232
Little whacker
in the junior high,

25:19.233 --> 25:21.167
But in my world, you're
about as worrisome

25:21.168 --> 25:22.936
As a cloudy day.

25:35.199 --> 25:37.100
You got
anything to say?

25:39.704 --> 25:41.705
Me, I like to talk.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.206
I love to talk.

25:43.207 --> 25:45.609
Live to talk.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.429
You got any
amusing anecdotes?

25:49.864 --> 25:52.332
I'm living through one
right now.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.834
There's
some truth there.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.137
Yeah. This is a trip

25:57.138 --> 26:00.240
We won't
soon forget, huh?

26:00.241 --> 26:02.342
You can count on it.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.577
Ha ha ha ha.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.411
These are the
cumberland mountains.

26:21.779 --> 26:23.247
Beautiful, aren't they?

26:33.041 --> 26:34.074
Heh.

26:34.075 --> 26:35.943
You know what?

26:35.944 --> 26:37.444
The more you babble,

26:37.445 --> 26:39.013
The more
you reveal yourself

26:39.014 --> 26:41.615
As an insecure fool
who's deathly afraid

26:41.616 --> 26:43.550
He's gonna blow
his chance with my mother.

26:43.551 --> 26:45.218
What chance, duncan?

26:45.219 --> 26:47.054
My name's doyle,

26:47.055 --> 26:48.989
And the chance
I'm referring to

26:48.990 --> 26:50.658
Has dollar signs
in front of it.

26:50.659 --> 26:51.859
A chance
at your mom's money.

26:53.695 --> 26:54.695
Bingo.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.030
I may not look like

26:56.031 --> 26:57.497
I could finance
a trip to the zoo,

26:57.498 --> 27:00.200
But the truth is, I make
a pretty good living.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.569
My income's a damn sight
more than your father

27:02.570 --> 27:04.738
Gives your mother
to live on.

27:04.739 --> 27:07.240
Oh, yeah, but my money
doesn't count

27:07.241 --> 27:08.575
In your neighborhood...

27:08.576 --> 27:10.544
Because I worked for it.

27:14.315 --> 27:16.684
Working for your money
doesn't matter

27:16.685 --> 27:19.286
In your part
of the world.

27:19.287 --> 27:24.658
It's whose crotch the doctor
yanked you out of, huh?

27:24.659 --> 27:26.293
You're disgusting.

27:26.294 --> 27:30.731
¶ have you ever seen ¶

27:30.732 --> 27:35.102
¶ the night so long? ¶

27:35.103 --> 27:40.174
¶ stars begin to cry ¶

27:40.175 --> 27:46.513
¶ that means they've
lost the will to live ¶

27:46.514 --> 27:51.618
¶ I'm so lonesome,
I could cry ¶

28:33.978 --> 28:35.812
Fill it up, please.

28:35.813 --> 28:37.414
Unleaded-regular.

29:16.871 --> 29:19.139
We're going to
have some fun now.

29:20.775 --> 29:22.309
Do you like
fireworks?

29:29.818 --> 29:32.052
Is that a "yes,"
a "no," a "maybe"?

29:32.053 --> 29:33.987
Your testicles
descending? What?

29:33.988 --> 29:36.357
Fireworks are illegal
in illinois.

29:36.358 --> 29:37.991
Yes, they are.
But this is tennessee,

29:37.992 --> 29:39.560
So it doesn't matter.

29:39.561 --> 29:43.029
You're going to detonate
this material now?

29:43.030 --> 29:44.514
Not here
in the gas station.

29:44.515 --> 29:47.217
Are you nuts?
Go down the road apiece.

29:47.218 --> 29:50.887
I got m-80s,
I got dragon tongues,

29:50.888 --> 29:52.388
I got, uh...

29:52.389 --> 29:54.157
Oh... Heh heh heh...

29:54.158 --> 29:56.526
I don't even know
what this is.

29:56.527 --> 29:59.029
I got jersey stinkers,
bombay bugles,

29:59.030 --> 30:02.966
And for later,
I got a bag of pretzels,

30:02.967 --> 30:04.868
And...

30:04.869 --> 30:09.773
I got a deck
of racy playing cards.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.643
Huh?

30:52.517 --> 30:53.850
You know what?

30:53.851 --> 30:57.153
You're like a great big
demented child.

35:27.992 --> 35:28.959
Now, that was fun.

35:33.330 --> 35:35.966
Can't beat a good
fireworks show.

35:47.678 --> 35:49.779
Well, I guess
you want to eat.

36:31.338 --> 36:33.690
Waitress: Okay, sugar,
what'll it be?

36:36.394 --> 36:38.628
What won't
make me vomit?

36:50.891 --> 36:52.492
I know you're lying.

36:52.493 --> 36:54.194
Dutch: No,
we're getting along great.

36:54.195 --> 36:56.129
Well, a few problems.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.098
Nah, nothing serious.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.353
<i>¶ till the end of
the world rolls 'round ¶</i>

37:03.354 --> 37:05.488
<i>¶ I'll keep on loving you ¶</i>

37:05.489 --> 37:07.757
<i>¶ as long as the sun
goes up and comes down ¶</i>

37:07.758 --> 37:09.993
<i>¶ till the big blue sky
comes down to the ground ¶</i>

37:09.994 --> 37:12.262
<i>¶ as long as the world
goes around and around ¶</i>

37:12.263 --> 37:14.464
<i>¶ I'll keep on lovin' you ¶</i>

37:20.988 --> 37:23.356
<i>¶ I tried to sail
the sea of life ¶</i>

37:23.357 --> 37:25.375
<i>¶ I rowed my boat alone ¶</i>

37:25.376 --> 37:27.277
<i>¶ your love meant
nothin' to me, dear ¶</i>

37:27.278 --> 37:29.679
<i>¶ my heart
was made of stone ¶</i>

37:29.680 --> 37:31.681
<i>¶ to a harbor filled
with loneliness ¶</i>

37:31.682 --> 37:33.850
<i>¶ my little boat
was moored ¶</i>

37:33.851 --> 37:35.886
<i>¶ and then the day
I first met you ¶</i>

37:35.887 --> 37:38.688
<i>¶ I fell right overboard ¶</i>

37:38.689 --> 37:41.091
<i>¶ till the end of
the world rolls 'round ¶</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:43.226
<i>¶ I'll keep on
lovin' you... ¶</i>

38:20.765 --> 38:23.533
<i>¶ so now I know
the way I felt ¶</i>

38:23.534 --> 38:25.402
<i>¶ was only selfish pride ¶</i>

38:25.403 --> 38:27.537
<i>¶ I thought my heart
was fireproof ¶</i>

38:27.538 --> 38:29.922
<i>¶ but you burned
your way inside ¶</i>

38:29.923 --> 38:31.474
<i>¶ so tell me what
I've got to do ¶</i>

38:31.475 --> 38:32.942
<i>¶ and tell me- ¶</i>

38:59.553 --> 39:00.953
Smoke bother you?

39:02.956 --> 39:03.889
Yes.

39:09.896 --> 39:12.148
You're asking for it
so bad.

39:12.149 --> 39:14.484
Heh heh heh.

39:14.485 --> 39:15.568
I'm not kidding.

39:15.569 --> 39:17.737
You have no idea
how serious I can get

39:17.738 --> 39:20.673
When I want to
let somebody have it.

39:20.674 --> 39:22.041
Hmm. You know,

39:22.042 --> 39:24.410
You might be able
to do some damage

39:24.411 --> 39:26.679
To the small
and exclusive group

39:26.680 --> 39:28.514
Of people
that care about you.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.753
But... I don't think

39:33.754 --> 39:36.939
You could raise a welt
on my fanny...

39:36.940 --> 39:38.491
Because frankly,

39:38.492 --> 39:40.126
I don't care
if you live, die,

39:40.127 --> 39:42.462
Or grow mushrooms
in your crack.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.832
I'll get you so bad.

39:45.833 --> 39:47.734
I don't think so.

39:47.735 --> 39:48.901
You want to put
some money on it?

39:48.902 --> 39:50.870
How much?
$5,000.

39:50.871 --> 39:51.854
$5,000.

39:53.790 --> 39:56.159
I'll bet you got it,
too, huh?

39:56.160 --> 39:59.729
In a little gilded box
under your bed.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.464
We'll keep it modest.

40:01.465 --> 40:03.233
20 bucks.

40:08.272 --> 40:09.321
It's a bet.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.376
Hey! Oh! Aah!

40:15.129 --> 40:16.562
Ow!

40:16.563 --> 40:18.381
Damn it! Ow!

40:24.155 --> 40:26.356
Bastard! You little
son of a bitch!

40:37.234 --> 40:39.102
Uhh!

40:43.156 --> 40:44.490
Go to hell!

40:50.931 --> 40:52.582
I won the bet! Ha ha!

40:57.471 --> 40:58.922
Yah!

41:05.412 --> 41:06.512
Throw one more-

41:06.513 --> 41:08.380
Throw one more,
and I'm leaving you.

41:08.381 --> 41:09.882
Promise?

41:09.883 --> 41:12.351
Guaranteed.

41:12.352 --> 41:13.686
Good riddance!

41:18.592 --> 41:21.894
Here. I'll see you
at the motel...

41:21.895 --> 41:23.863
About 50 miles
down the road.

41:25.466 --> 41:26.315
Uhh!

41:33.090 --> 41:35.341
Wait a minute!

41:35.342 --> 41:36.776
Stop!

41:36.777 --> 41:38.277
I'll die!

42:15.483 --> 42:16.716
Uhh!

42:32.133 --> 42:33.466
Hello.

42:33.467 --> 42:34.601
Hello?

42:35.869 --> 42:36.936
Hello?

42:44.395 --> 42:45.728
Shit.

44:04.341 --> 44:05.774
You want to
close the door?

44:07.611 --> 44:10.012
I could have frozen
to death, you asshole.

44:10.013 --> 44:11.714
Oh, I don't think
you would've frozen.

44:11.715 --> 44:13.015
Not solid, anyway.

44:13.016 --> 44:14.850
It's not quite cold
enough for that.

44:23.793 --> 44:26.295
Here's something you should
know about me, dale.

44:26.296 --> 44:29.465
I don't screw around.
You piss me off,

44:29.466 --> 44:31.033
I react.

44:31.034 --> 44:33.068
I'm not your dad.
I'm not your grampy.

44:33.069 --> 44:34.403
I'm not your uncle.

44:34.404 --> 44:37.206
I'm a working-class
nobody,

44:37.207 --> 44:40.075
And I don't take crap
from kiddies.

44:47.551 --> 44:49.352
Where's my bag?

44:49.353 --> 44:51.937
Oh, I didn't bother
to bring it in.

44:51.938 --> 44:53.939
I figured you for dead.

44:56.277 --> 44:57.577
Give me the keys.

45:01.415 --> 45:02.582
Lock up
when you're through.

45:20.984 --> 45:22.117
Doyle!

45:22.118 --> 45:23.569
Whoa!

45:23.570 --> 45:24.620
Doyle!

45:24.621 --> 45:28.324
Just-what the hell
are you doing?

45:28.325 --> 45:29.124
Get back here!

45:32.729 --> 45:33.829
Damn it!

45:42.072 --> 45:43.573
God damn...

45:52.549 --> 45:54.349
Uhh!

45:58.555 --> 45:59.488
Doyle.

46:01.257 --> 46:02.608
Doyle!

46:32.305 --> 46:33.239
Doyle.

46:36.309 --> 46:37.577
Doyle!

46:45.068 --> 46:47.336
I never saw a thing!

46:47.337 --> 46:49.122
He came from
out of nowhere!

46:49.123 --> 46:50.956
Doyle!

47:03.970 --> 47:04.904
Doyle.

47:14.114 --> 47:16.615
I think
this makes us even.

47:46.396 --> 47:47.763
You're a lucky man.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.266
Thanks.

47:52.336 --> 47:55.171
Hey, thanks for going
along with my story.

47:55.172 --> 47:56.739
I really appreciate it.

47:56.740 --> 47:58.674
The kid's got
emotional problems.

47:58.675 --> 48:01.643
The last thing he needs
is police trouble.

48:05.782 --> 48:07.283
Take this...

48:07.284 --> 48:09.852
Put it towards any repairs
you might have and your time.

48:09.853 --> 48:12.355
If it's not enough,
call me.

48:12.356 --> 48:15.091
My number's
on the card. Okay?

48:15.092 --> 48:17.260
Thanks. I appreciate it.

48:19.096 --> 48:21.297
If it wasn't
for your daddy,

48:21.298 --> 48:24.333
I'd have busted
every bone in your body!

48:36.880 --> 48:39.048
Show's over. Go home.

48:39.049 --> 48:40.232
Go home.

48:46.339 --> 48:48.240
Listen, you little
son of a bitch,

48:48.241 --> 48:50.276
You could've killed somebody
with a stunt like that.

48:50.277 --> 48:52.844
That poor bastard was on
his way home to see his family,

48:52.845 --> 48:55.814
And because you want to play
some kind of spoiled brat prank,

48:55.815 --> 48:57.316
You put his life
in jeopardy.

48:57.317 --> 48:59.885
Now, what gives you
the right to do that, huh?

48:59.886 --> 49:02.572
I guess I didn't
think about that.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.540
You better start thinking
about a little something else

49:04.541 --> 49:06.241
Besides your own
spoiled ass.

49:06.242 --> 49:07.910
I took on
this idiotic assignment

49:07.911 --> 49:09.511
Because I love your mother.

49:09.512 --> 49:11.747
I got to wonder
how nuts I am.

49:11.748 --> 49:13.583
Man, I've met some scum
in my life,

49:13.584 --> 49:16.218
But you beat all, man.
You are absolutely worthless.

49:16.219 --> 49:18.254
You know what?
This isn't a joke anymore.

49:18.255 --> 49:20.722
This is a full-blown mission.
You're not gonna beat me.

49:20.723 --> 49:23.192
I've had my head split open,
my nose mashed.

49:23.193 --> 49:25.127
I've been kicked and beat
and left for dead.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.896
When I set you down
on your mama's doorstep,

49:27.897 --> 49:30.366
You're going to be
one whipped little puppy.

49:37.407 --> 49:39.741
Don't flatter yourself.

49:41.278 --> 49:42.845
Get your hands down.

49:42.846 --> 49:44.847
I'm not taking
any more of your crap.

49:44.848 --> 49:46.915
You touch me once more,
you'll be sorry.

49:46.916 --> 49:49.418
You want to go? Is that it?
You want me to go?

49:49.419 --> 49:50.819
Hell, I'd love to go.
You want to go?

49:50.820 --> 49:52.921
Yeah.
Okay, fine.

49:52.922 --> 49:55.557
Let's see if your punch
is as big as your mouth.

49:55.558 --> 49:58.027
Only this time,
no sissy kicks, okay?

49:58.028 --> 49:59.195
No geometry,

49:59.196 --> 50:02.264
No kamikaze tricks,
no sucker punches.

50:02.265 --> 50:04.900
Just good all-american
street fighting.

50:04.901 --> 50:06.902
Let me show you
how to do it, all right?

50:06.903 --> 50:08.937
Give me
your little digits.

50:08.938 --> 50:11.440
Here. That's it.
Curl your little digits,

50:11.441 --> 50:12.975
And you wad those up

50:12.976 --> 50:14.843
In little bitty balls
like that.

50:14.844 --> 50:17.013
Watch your little thumbies.
Put your thumbies out here

50:17.014 --> 50:18.381
So you don't break them.

50:18.382 --> 50:20.182
Get loose. That's it.
Bend your little knees.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.218
That's it. Okay?

50:22.219 --> 50:24.686
Let me see you fight
like a man, okay?

50:24.687 --> 50:26.822
Now, you take
the first shot.

50:26.823 --> 50:28.690
Give me your best punch,
all right?

50:28.691 --> 50:31.860
Come on. Come on,
give it to me, pipsqueak.

52:09.843 --> 52:12.545
¶ ba-dah-ow ¶

52:42.508 --> 52:44.810
How'd you sleep...

52:44.811 --> 52:46.078
Ace?

52:50.316 --> 52:52.184
Okay.
Good.

52:53.486 --> 52:54.820
How's your face?

52:54.821 --> 52:55.988
Fine.

52:55.989 --> 52:57.823
No problem.

52:57.824 --> 53:01.560
Partial apology if I did
any permanent damage.

53:01.561 --> 53:04.096
It's gonna take
a lot more than you got

53:04.097 --> 53:06.465
To give me
any permanent damage.

53:09.269 --> 53:10.836
My doctor wants me

53:10.837 --> 53:12.805
To get my cholesterol
under 1,000,

53:12.806 --> 53:16.208
But hot cakes and bacon
on a cold day-

53:16.209 --> 53:17.877
Pretty sexy.

53:17.878 --> 53:20.095
I want you to know
that I could have hurt you

53:20.096 --> 53:21.663
A lot more than I did.

53:21.664 --> 53:23.482
Yeah.
Seriously.

53:23.483 --> 53:25.050
I'm a high brown belt.

53:25.051 --> 53:26.218
Yeah?

53:26.219 --> 53:29.288
Yeah. I've been training
for 3 years.

53:33.627 --> 53:35.694
Your working-class ego

53:35.695 --> 53:37.797
Can't handle a kid of
my position and standing

53:37.798 --> 53:40.232
Beating you up, can it?

53:40.233 --> 53:42.935
My working-class ego
can handle that

53:42.936 --> 53:45.137
And a hell of
a lot more.

53:45.138 --> 53:48.223
Are you admitting that
I could defeat you in a fight?

53:50.143 --> 53:51.877
Why don't you shut up?

53:51.878 --> 53:53.913
I beat you mentally,

53:53.914 --> 53:56.481
Then I beat you
physically.

53:56.482 --> 53:58.383
You know, yesterday
you had nothing to say.

53:58.384 --> 53:59.584
Today you're a parrot.

53:59.585 --> 54:00.886
I'm ready here.

54:04.257 --> 54:08.160
You know, for a split
second last night,

54:08.161 --> 54:09.862
I sort
of respected you...

54:09.863 --> 54:13.365
For how you handled
the cops and the accident.

54:13.366 --> 54:17.135
But today, I see my initial
impression is correct.

54:19.339 --> 54:20.706
You're a clod.

54:21.875 --> 54:24.109
And the cool part is...

54:24.110 --> 54:25.711
I can say that,

54:25.712 --> 54:28.146
And you can't do
anything about it

54:28.147 --> 54:29.682
'cause I can
kick your butt.

54:32.018 --> 54:33.986
Well,
I won't cop to that,

54:33.987 --> 54:36.121
But I will say this-

54:36.122 --> 54:38.624
There's one thing
I can do that you can't.

54:38.625 --> 54:40.860
What?

54:44.780 --> 54:47.116
I can pay
for my breakfast.

54:56.326 --> 54:58.660
Nothing burps
better than bacon.

55:02.765 --> 55:04.899
Your water looked tasty.

55:29.359 --> 55:32.060
You're insane.
Do you have any idea

55:32.061 --> 55:34.129
How dangerous it is
to hitchhike?

55:36.299 --> 55:38.300
You have
a high brown belt.

55:38.301 --> 55:40.369
What are you
worried about?

55:40.370 --> 55:42.271
You're an idiot.

55:42.272 --> 55:44.739
You got a better way
to get home?

55:44.740 --> 55:47.309
We're not without means,
for god's sake.

55:47.310 --> 55:49.077
We are at the moment.
We got 20 bucks.

55:49.078 --> 55:51.647
You ever heard
of a telephone?

55:51.648 --> 55:55.184
Call my mother.
I'll call my grandfather.

55:57.671 --> 55:59.705
Someday you're gonna
get into a situation

55:59.706 --> 56:01.740
Where you can't call
for help.

56:01.741 --> 56:04.009
You'll have to depend
on yourself.

56:04.010 --> 56:06.311
And you'll
let yourself down.

56:06.312 --> 56:07.162
I'm not calling

56:07.163 --> 56:08.863
Because I don't want
your mother to think

56:08.864 --> 56:10.765
We can't make it home
on our own.

56:10.766 --> 56:13.402
Call it male pride.
Old-fashioned,

56:13.403 --> 56:15.270
Pigheaded,
working-class,

56:15.271 --> 56:17.272
Pre-fax machine/
car phone

56:17.273 --> 56:18.773
Masculine pride.

56:18.774 --> 56:20.642
No accountants,
no lawyers,

56:20.643 --> 56:24.413
No mommies, no daddies,
no washington lobbyists,

56:24.414 --> 56:27.082
Just a man...
And his wits.

56:27.083 --> 56:28.983
Yeah. That's helpful

56:28.984 --> 56:31.186
When you're face-down,
dead in a ditch.

56:31.187 --> 56:32.721
That's part of it, too.

56:32.722 --> 56:35.357
But you roll the dice,
you take what you get.

56:45.968 --> 56:48.237
We're not doing
too good here.

57:01.768 --> 57:03.034
Excuse me.

57:05.438 --> 57:07.739
Does that music
have to be so loud?

57:12.878 --> 57:14.730
Thank you.

57:33.132 --> 57:35.133
What'd you pay
for them shoes?

57:41.107 --> 57:42.140
Did you steal them?

57:47.413 --> 57:49.047
I chargedthem.

57:49.048 --> 57:50.048
Hmm.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.586
See, my friend here

57:54.587 --> 57:57.089
Really wants
those shoes.

58:15.674 --> 58:18.777
Well, we're really
moving now, huh?

58:23.149 --> 58:25.283
It's your mother.
Come on, talk to her.

58:47.106 --> 58:49.440
Getting hungry for
your turkey dinner?

59:00.270 --> 59:01.453
Remember-
I'm your dad.

59:01.454 --> 59:02.954
I got a bad heart.

59:04.607 --> 59:06.175
Dale, look at me.

59:09.011 --> 59:10.879
Is that your
most pathetic look?

59:10.880 --> 59:13.965
This is my
"death to you" look.

59:13.966 --> 59:16.100
That's not gonna
get us a ride.

59:16.101 --> 59:17.268
Be pathetic!

59:17.269 --> 59:18.202
Try it!

59:20.172 --> 59:22.674
Pretend that you're not
gonna get $10 million

59:22.675 --> 59:24.476
When you're 21.

59:24.477 --> 59:27.462
You have no plan,
do you?

59:27.463 --> 59:29.498
I got a rough outline.

59:31.167 --> 59:34.135
Actually,
I'm the idiot...

59:34.136 --> 59:35.571
'cause I'm going
along with it.

59:39.775 --> 59:41.510
See? Hands up. Try it.

59:44.647 --> 59:46.014
Come on.

59:47.550 --> 59:50.051
Look up. Look up.
Come on.

59:50.052 --> 59:53.788
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.104
Hurry, hurry!
It's freezing.

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.305
All right.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.107
Oh, no.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.377
Oh, my god.

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.362
That's it.
Smile, smile.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:19.865
Smile.
That's it.

01:00:29.775 --> 01:00:31.409
Smile with
that face.

01:00:38.618 --> 01:00:40.218
Attaboy.
Attaboy!

01:00:42.922 --> 01:00:44.990
Oh, help us here,
please.

01:00:46.993 --> 01:00:49.010
It's pathetic.
It is really pathetic.

01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:50.345
Beg.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.846
help me.

01:00:51.847 --> 01:00:53.148
Help me.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.849
I don't have a ride.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:58.136
Help me.

01:00:58.137 --> 01:00:59.670
We have
to help them.

01:00:59.671 --> 01:01:00.605
That's it.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.096
You want a ride,

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:09.798
You got to
look grievous.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.101
See?

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:14.303
My heart.

01:01:22.094 --> 01:01:22.994
Hey, kid!

01:01:26.732 --> 01:01:29.100
We're going to hammond.
Do you wanna come along?

01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:30.268
Get the suitcase.
Let's go.

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.337
We got a ride.
Come on.

01:01:32.338 --> 01:01:34.672
Not too fast,
but not too slow.

01:01:34.673 --> 01:01:36.207
That's it. Wave
at them a little.

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:37.142
That's it.

01:01:54.226 --> 01:01:56.194
<i>¶ tryin' to make
a silk purse ¶</i>

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.680
<i>¶ from a drunk,
old pig now ¶</i>

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.800
<i>¶ just because
of mass hysteria ¶</i>

01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:04.753
<i>¶ don't mean
that it's hip ¶</i>

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.192
<i>¶ I like to scare
the next-door neighbors ¶</i>

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:13.628
<i>¶ bring the property
values down... ¶</i>

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.165
You guys on vacation
or something?

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.801
We're going home to
hammond for the holidays.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:21.737
Both our families
are from there.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.538
Ah. We're
going home, too.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.440
You got a nice kid.

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.675
Yeah.

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:32.030
<i>¶ baby, don't you know
that I'm stuck on ¶</i>

01:02:32.031 --> 01:02:34.399
<i>¶ the wrong side
of the tracks... ¶</i>

01:02:37.803 --> 01:02:39.871
So, what's the word
on you two?

01:02:39.872 --> 01:02:41.039
How do you mean?

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.540
Well,
are you drifters?

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.042
Oh, yeah,
more or less.

01:02:44.043 --> 01:02:45.510
Yeah,
I thought so.

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:46.711
How about you?

01:02:46.712 --> 01:02:50.715
Brock?
Yeah?

01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:53.551
Ha ha. Dutch wants
to know what we do.

01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:55.319
Well, I don't want
to be nosy, you know.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.488
I was just making conversation.
It's not important.

01:02:57.489 --> 01:02:59.290
Brock: No, please.
It's fine.

01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:00.692
No, tell him.

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:02.694
We're call girls.

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:05.414
<i>¶ there was
a little mansion ¶</i>

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.717
<i>¶ but it seemed
so damn run-down ¶</i>

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:12.804
<i>¶ baby, you are
out of luck... ¶</i>

01:03:12.805 --> 01:03:15.173
I didn't want
to say "prostitute"

01:03:15.174 --> 01:03:18.092
In front of the boy.

01:03:18.093 --> 01:03:20.879
<i>¶ that I'm stuck on... ¶</i>

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.647
I appreciate it.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:27.251
So, we were down
in new orleans

01:03:27.252 --> 01:03:28.753
At the superdome

01:03:28.754 --> 01:03:30.521
For the housewares
convention...

01:03:32.758 --> 01:03:35.326
We also do
a little dancing.

01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:36.795
Naked?

01:03:39.531 --> 01:03:41.499
Don't worry about it.
I have a little brother.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.568
Just on top, sweetie.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:54.045
<i>¶ if the music
makes me money ¶</i>

01:03:54.046 --> 01:03:57.282
<i>¶ and it brings me
lots of cash ¶</i>

01:03:57.283 --> 01:04:00.151
<i>¶ it'll be
the outlaw country... ¶</i>

01:04:19.205 --> 01:04:20.739
Doyle:
So your parents know

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.807
And they haven't
disowned you?

01:04:22.808 --> 01:04:24.809
Ha ha.
No, not yet.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:27.545
Don't you think that's
a little amazing?

01:04:27.546 --> 01:04:30.414
Hmm... Not really.
I'm honest about it.

01:04:30.415 --> 01:04:33.017
And I don't hurt anybody-
not on purpose.

01:04:33.018 --> 01:04:35.720
You don't think it
hurts your parents?

01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:38.790
Well, eventually,
if you live long enough,

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.292
You're bound to hurt
your parents somehow.

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:42.844
Yeah...

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.382
It's none
of my business.

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:53.321
So... Do you get along
with your dad?

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.390
That guy's
not my dad.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:57.559
That's my mother's
boyfriend.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.028
I hate saying that.
It's so sick.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.499
He's picking me up
for thanksgiving break,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.167
'cause I go
to this private school

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.436
Down south.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.871
I hate his guts.

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:15.777
He's trying to
get to know me

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.979
'cause I think
he's planning

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.016
On marrying
my mother.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.484
Is there something
wrong with that?

01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:25.987
I'm not too crazy
about my mother

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.389
To begin with,

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.457
And he's
just a slob.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:33.295
The less I know,
the better.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.496
Yeah, well, he seems to be
going through a lot of shit

01:05:35.497 --> 01:05:36.998
To get you home.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:39.401
It's on purpose.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:41.102
See, he's got this
ridiculous plan

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:43.238
To drag me around
until I break.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.472
Ha ha ha.

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.108
He's got a shock
coming, though.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:48.376
I don't break.

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.578
Hmm.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.780
So, what's wrong
with your mom?

01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:55.683
She divorced my dad,
for starters.

01:05:55.684 --> 01:05:58.786
Yeah, well, it takes 2
to make a thing go bad.

01:05:58.787 --> 01:06:00.055
She didn't
make it work.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.259
You know...

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.828
Maybe it's just easier
to blame her.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:47.335
You know,
maybe you should stop

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.736
Knocking your mom
so much

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:50.271
And try to make things
work with her.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:56.011
I don't think that's
going to happen.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.046
But I really like
talking to you.

01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.347
Ha ha.

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:03.784
Well, maybe I'll come up
and visit you sometime.

01:07:03.785 --> 01:07:06.621
That would
be excellent.

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:07.788
Ha ha ha.

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:13.528
Heh heh.

01:08:04.696 --> 01:08:08.532
Brock...

01:08:08.533 --> 01:08:09.934
Hey...

01:08:09.935 --> 01:08:11.769
You want to wake up
your little friend

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:13.737
So he can stretch
his legs?

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.174
Mm.

01:08:21.447 --> 01:08:24.048
Hey. Ha ha.

01:08:24.049 --> 01:08:26.250
Hey... Wake up.

01:08:30.956 --> 01:08:33.424
You want to go
for a walk?

01:08:38.063 --> 01:08:40.564
Yeah.

01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:44.135
Yeah. I was just
dreaming about that.

01:08:44.136 --> 01:08:45.336
Ha ha ha.

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.307
Uhh.

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.290
What time is it?

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.558
7:30.

01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:26.261
I'll drive
the next shift.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:28.529
I'm fine. Could you
do me a favor, though?

01:09:28.529 --> 01:09:30.298
Could you go inside
and get directions?

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.015
I just want to make sure
I don't get all screwed up.

01:09:32.017 --> 01:09:33.984
Sure. We got
enough time to eat?

01:09:33.984 --> 01:09:35.319
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.121
You go inside and we'll
take care of this

01:09:37.122 --> 01:09:38.221
And we'll meet you
inside.

01:09:38.223 --> 01:09:39.557
Let's go, dobie.

01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:40.758
Uh...

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:43.627
I'll come in
with brock.

01:09:43.627 --> 01:09:46.096
Uh, no,
you go ahead, babe.

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:47.631
I, uh...

01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:51.602
I have to get something
from my bag.

01:09:51.603 --> 01:09:52.720
I'll meet you
inside, okay?

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.953
Okay.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.091
Bye.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.029
Yes.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.396
Yes!

01:10:02.397 --> 01:10:04.131
I lifted
the toad's wallet.

01:10:04.132 --> 01:10:05.233
Aah!

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.102
Oh... Why?

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:10.037
Because it was there.

01:10:10.038 --> 01:10:11.372
Well...

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.774
I was just beginning
to feel respectable.

01:10:13.775 --> 01:10:17.078
Let's not waste a lot
of time eating, okay?

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:22.467
I want to get back in
the car and keep moving.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.201
Yeah.

01:10:24.202 --> 01:10:26.537
Yeah, I know why
you want to keep moving.

01:10:26.538 --> 01:10:28.539
Let me tell you
something, dwight.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.541
Those 2 gals
are a couple of pros.

01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:33.010
I got half a mind to refuse
the rest of the trip.

01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:35.045
Do you know what
your mother would say

01:10:35.046 --> 01:10:37.014
If she knew what
you were doing?

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:39.400
You refuse the ride,

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:41.535
I'll tell her...
In detail.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.607
You know, you really are
a hypocrite, aren't you?

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.658
A couple of hookers...

01:10:47.659 --> 01:10:50.528
A couple of hookers
got a set of rockets,

01:10:50.529 --> 01:10:51.662
That's okay.

01:10:51.663 --> 01:10:54.599
But anyone else in their
station in life is scum.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.933
That's not true.

01:10:55.934 --> 01:10:58.002
You and I are riding
in the back seat from now on.

01:10:58.003 --> 01:11:00.204
Because what that
missile twister can teach you,

01:11:00.205 --> 01:11:01.906
You don't need to learn
till you're in prison.

01:11:01.907 --> 01:11:04.074
I'll decide what
I need to know,

01:11:04.075 --> 01:11:05.309
And she's not
like that.

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:06.243
She listens.

01:11:07.579 --> 01:11:09.046
That's her job.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.258
Shit!

01:11:21.259 --> 01:11:22.459
My wallet!

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:31.402
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!

01:11:35.607 --> 01:11:37.875
I can't believe it.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:39.309
Believe it.

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:41.779
Your angel with
the dirty wings flew...

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.614
Taking my wallet,
my luggage,

01:11:43.615 --> 01:11:45.282
My last cigar.

01:11:45.283 --> 01:11:49.486
She was so understanding
about my problems.

01:11:49.487 --> 01:11:52.056
Stuff your problems!

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:54.375
<i>Stuff your problems.</i>

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.260
If you weren't such
a spoiled little worm-

01:11:56.261 --> 01:11:57.929
Such a whining
little rodent,

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:00.598
I wouldn't have had
to come down here for you.

01:12:00.599 --> 01:12:01.899
You asked for it,
and you got it.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.067
True.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:04.268
It's not my fault.

01:12:04.269 --> 01:12:06.204
True. I know.
It's your mother's fault.

01:12:06.205 --> 01:12:07.672
Why is it her fault?

01:12:07.673 --> 01:12:09.740
Because
she gave birth to you.

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:11.059
And what about
your mother?

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.493
My mother's a saint.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:14.295
For what,
having puppies?

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.533
Oh...

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.435
Oh, you want
more, huh?

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.836
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:25.406
Come and get it.

01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:32.930
Chicken!

01:12:34.432 --> 01:12:36.734
Ah!

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.669
Oh!

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.057
Ow.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.300
God, you're pathetic.

01:13:06.698 --> 01:13:08.465
Here's the deal,
dobsy.

01:13:10.002 --> 01:13:12.870
I had 200 bucks
in the wallet.

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:17.742
You said
you were broke.

01:13:17.743 --> 01:13:19.076
I lied.

01:13:21.513 --> 01:13:24.749
You dishonest,
stupid jerk.

01:13:26.118 --> 01:13:28.819
We had money
all this time?

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:31.656
We could have
been home.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.041
Probably,
but I had this plan.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.109
Yeah, I know.

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.176
No, you don't know!

01:13:36.177 --> 01:13:37.912
I know you were
playing around,

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.463
Stretching this
whole thing out

01:13:39.464 --> 01:13:41.899
So we could get
to know each other.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.734
And then it blew up
in your face.

01:13:43.735 --> 01:13:46.203
I blew it,
and I'm sorry.

01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:48.238
I'm also out of ideas.

01:13:51.342 --> 01:13:53.878
I'm just going to sit here

01:13:53.879 --> 01:13:55.863
And hope I get arrested...

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.432
So I can get some sleep.

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.768
Call your mother.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.603
Have her send somebody
for you.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.272
You can call,
can't you?

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.639
I don't want to call.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.974
I'm sitting here,
and that's it.

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.976
You talk to your mom,

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:12.046
You tell her
that I said good luck.

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:14.415
Tell her the dutchboy's
calling it quits.

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:19.053
You're dumping my mom?

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:23.191
I'm sparing her of a life
of this kind of misery.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:25.743
She's going to blame me.

01:14:25.744 --> 01:14:28.429
I'll write a letter for you,
nice letter.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.331
Okay? Go on.

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.450
I thought
you loved her.

01:14:32.451 --> 01:14:35.252
I've talked and talked
and talked to you

01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:37.454
Until I could puke
coat hangers.

01:14:37.455 --> 01:14:39.957
I'm me, you're you.
There's no reason on earth

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:43.794
Why we should spend
any more time with each other.

01:14:43.795 --> 01:14:46.414
Okay. I just think
it's really sick

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:48.116
That you'd cut
my mom loose

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:49.683
Because you can't
get along with me.

01:14:49.684 --> 01:14:52.653
Why? You hate her.

01:14:54.305 --> 01:14:56.407
Don't fret.
It's okay.

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:58.843
She puts up with your crap,
she can handle mine.

01:14:58.844 --> 01:15:00.678
I never said
that I hated her.

01:15:00.679 --> 01:15:02.480
No. Gee, I'm sorry.

01:15:02.481 --> 01:15:05.349
You're the picture-
is-worth-1,000-words guy.

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:08.118
Yeah. Now, go on.
Go on. Make your call.

01:15:08.119 --> 01:15:09.820
Give me some peace.

01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:12.322
I don't
hate my mother...

01:15:12.323 --> 01:15:14.091
For the record.

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:15.793
Kiss my ass,
for the record!

01:15:18.129 --> 01:15:20.931
Act like a rodent
around somebody else.

01:15:20.932 --> 01:15:23.834
You've busted my balls.
Congratulations.

01:15:23.835 --> 01:15:25.469
Go on.

01:15:36.981 --> 01:15:39.283
Did she ever say that
she thinks I hate her?

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.064
I got it.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.567
Hello?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.836
Is-is mr. Standish in?

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:18.072
he's sleeping.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.073
Who's this?

01:16:40.879 --> 01:16:42.563
Mmm.

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:43.931
Who was it?

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.802
Some kid.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.326
Come on.

01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:16.113
We can make it home.

01:17:16.114 --> 01:17:17.948
We got this far,
didn't we?

01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:27.591
Where you going?

01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:28.592
Home.

01:17:28.593 --> 01:17:30.060
How?

01:17:30.061 --> 01:17:32.095
I'm calling your mom.
Enough of this.

01:17:32.096 --> 01:17:33.597
Wait a minute.

01:17:33.598 --> 01:17:37.484
It would really
mean a lot to me...

01:17:37.485 --> 01:17:40.521
To not have to call
my mother for help.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.477
You remember this?

01:17:47.478 --> 01:17:49.212
I still owe you one.

01:17:49.213 --> 01:17:51.248
You let me call your mom,
I forget about it.

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:52.616
No dice.

01:17:52.617 --> 01:17:53.984
This isn't working out.

01:17:53.985 --> 01:17:55.920
We're not masters
of the highway.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.922
We were robbed
by home-bound hookers.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:01.291
Only because you fell
asleep, and I got...

01:18:03.361 --> 01:18:05.662
Horny.

01:18:12.437 --> 01:18:13.671
You did?

01:18:13.672 --> 01:18:15.039
Sort of.

01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:21.812
Congratulations.

01:18:24.049 --> 01:18:25.382
Slap it.

01:18:27.218 --> 01:18:28.619
There you go.

01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:33.624
See, I'm not such
a bad guy, huh?

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.960
Yeah. Yeah,
you are, but...

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.361
I'm still going
to get you home.

01:18:50.575 --> 01:18:53.510
¶ everybody knows
you been steppin' on my toes ¶

01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:56.080
¶ and I'm gettin'
pretty tired of it ¶

01:18:56.081 --> 01:18:58.215
¶ you keep-a
steppin' outta line ¶

01:18:58.216 --> 01:19:00.017
¶ and-a messin'
with my mind ¶

01:19:00.018 --> 01:19:02.953
¶ if you had any sense,
you'd quit ¶

01:19:02.954 --> 01:19:04.822
¶ ever since you were
a little bitty... ¶

01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:18.602
Uhh!

01:19:18.603 --> 01:19:19.569
We're here.

01:19:21.539 --> 01:19:22.772
Where?

01:19:22.773 --> 01:19:24.074
I don't know.

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.176
There's got to be a-

01:19:43.177 --> 01:19:45.613
There's got to be a guard
around here somewhere.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.415
We'll ask him.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.432
Get out of here.

01:19:48.433 --> 01:19:50.067
Aah.

01:19:50.068 --> 01:19:51.568
Don't come back.

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:53.703
Heh heh heh.

01:20:00.578 --> 01:20:02.312
Ohh.

01:20:02.313 --> 01:20:03.880
I could sue you
for this.

01:20:03.881 --> 01:20:05.999
Ohh...

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.903
Dutch: Hey,
the kid doesn't mean it.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:11.888
I do so.
And you can't hit me

01:20:11.889 --> 01:20:13.457
'cause I'm a minor.

01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:15.592
Ha ha ha ha.

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:16.560
Ohh!

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:19.229
Aah! Aah!

01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:21.182
Hey, hey.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:22.582
Hey, you okay?

01:20:22.583 --> 01:20:24.051
Hey, I told
you guys-

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.752
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

01:20:25.753 --> 01:20:27.487
What the hell-
we don't want any trouble.

01:20:27.488 --> 01:20:28.823
Hey!

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.108
Relax, all right?
Why don't you guys

01:20:31.109 --> 01:20:33.110
Go inside and we'll
hit the road, all right?

01:20:33.111 --> 01:20:33.928
Uhh!
Aah!

01:20:35.746 --> 01:20:37.114
Get away from him!

01:20:37.115 --> 01:20:38.115
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:38.116 --> 01:20:40.284
Uhh!
Uhh!

01:20:40.285 --> 01:20:41.902
I said, leave him alone!

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.204
Knock it off!
You-

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:45.773
Get your tail
out of here!

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.374
You're outnumbered
now, boy.

01:20:49.927 --> 01:20:52.362
All right, kid.

01:21:02.006 --> 01:21:03.173
Heh heh heh.

01:21:03.174 --> 01:21:06.476
Haaaaaah!

01:21:06.477 --> 01:21:08.212
Uhh!

01:21:08.213 --> 01:21:09.446
Hyah!

01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:11.715
Uhh!
Ohh!

01:21:13.818 --> 01:21:15.185
Uhh!
Oh!

01:21:19.257 --> 01:21:20.174
Whew.

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:21.909
Oh.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:22.877
Are you okay?

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.879
Ooh. We're gonna
get you, kid!

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.079
Yeah.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:30.734
You got me mad now.
You really got me-

01:21:30.735 --> 01:21:32.802
Dutch: Doyle,
listen, listen...

01:21:32.803 --> 01:21:34.838
I'll make you
eat that gun.

01:21:34.839 --> 01:21:37.174
Dutch: All right,
now you guys really did it.

01:21:37.175 --> 01:21:38.675
You got him angry.

01:21:38.676 --> 01:21:41.678
Pete, let's go. You
don't have to shoot 'em.

01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:45.649
Pete... You don't
have to shoot 'em!

01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:47.251
You don't have
to shoot 'em, pete.

01:21:47.252 --> 01:21:49.153
The kid is crazy.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:53.090
Don't be crazy, pete.

01:21:53.091 --> 01:21:56.393
Tell the voices that
you just killed somebody.

01:21:56.394 --> 01:21:59.546
You know, that guy.
You just killed somebody!

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:00.480
Yeah!

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:06.420
Uhh! Ohh,
I just killed somebody!

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.022
He just killed
somebody.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.957
Oh. They won't listen.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.458
Don't shoot me.

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:12.793
I gotta do it.

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:14.728
I gotta get rid
of the voices!

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:16.730
Listen, listen,
it's the holiday season.

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.465
These guys probably
got families.

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.534
I do! I do!
He's single.

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:21.802
Why'd you say that?

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.637
Now I gotta kill
your families, too.

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:25.973
Dutch: Oh, no. Calm down,
pete. Look, forget these guys.

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:27.958
We'll find some nice motel
you can burn down.

01:22:31.462 --> 01:22:33.697
Yeah. Motel.
Lots of people.

01:22:36.567 --> 01:22:37.935
Okay.

01:22:37.936 --> 01:22:39.970
You guys are very lucky.

01:22:39.971 --> 01:22:43.640
Kid hardly ever backs off
once he gets his neck up.

01:22:43.641 --> 01:22:46.710
So long, guys.

01:23:00.274 --> 01:23:01.408
Excuse me,

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:03.977
But would you please
get out of here?

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.663
This isn't a warming
house, you know.

01:23:05.664 --> 01:23:07.665
The boy has a wound
on his head.

01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:09.900
We need to use
the restroom.

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:12.736
I'm so sorry, but
from time to time,

01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:15.172
These... Road people
wander in.

01:23:15.173 --> 01:23:17.007
Excuse me.

01:23:18.476 --> 01:23:19.510
I said out.

01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:21.011
Can he wash his face?

01:23:21.012 --> 01:23:22.313
No!

01:23:22.314 --> 01:23:24.248
I'll go outside.
Let him use the bathroom.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.283
Robert, you want
to come over here

01:23:26.284 --> 01:23:27.451
And help me?

01:23:29.955 --> 01:23:31.555
Excuse us.

01:23:31.556 --> 01:23:35.059
Excuse me, sir.
You're on the road?

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.359
Yeah. Why?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.528
The boy's your son?

01:23:41.365 --> 01:23:42.633
That's right.

01:23:42.634 --> 01:23:45.836
We're up from georgia
on our way to chicago.

01:23:45.837 --> 01:23:47.771
Lost our car.
We got robbed.

01:23:47.772 --> 01:23:48.839
Oh, god.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.974
It's all right.

01:23:59.918 --> 01:24:02.486
They'll take good
care of you here.

01:24:02.487 --> 01:24:03.887
Who?

01:24:03.888 --> 01:24:07.725
This is a center
for displaced families.

01:24:07.726 --> 01:24:11.161
Mike's supervisor
is on the board.

01:24:11.162 --> 01:24:13.530
So, good luck,
all right?

01:24:13.531 --> 01:24:15.266
Don't give up.

01:24:15.267 --> 01:24:15.916
Okay.

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.703
Have a little faith
in your father.

01:24:19.704 --> 01:24:21.688
He's doing
his best, okay?

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:24.525
All right. Bye-bye.
Let's go, hon.

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.427
Bye-bye.

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:38.622
And, uh, all our best
for a happy holiday.

01:26:17.021 --> 01:26:19.890
Would you like to see
the wine list?

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:39.359
That's mine.

01:27:06.271 --> 01:27:08.471
You can have it.

01:27:20.551 --> 01:27:21.985
That was nice.

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.585
Jeez!

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.881
Son of a-

01:27:50.882 --> 01:27:53.249
You have to
click it.

01:27:57.989 --> 01:27:59.139
Is there a problem?

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.424
No, no, I got it.
Thanks.

01:28:36.594 --> 01:28:38.529
Ahh, jeez.

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.450
Shh!
Shh!

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.456
Shh!

01:28:55.896 --> 01:28:57.697
Woman:
It's all right now.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.013
Doyle.

01:29:14.014 --> 01:29:15.982
Switch cots with me.
Mine won't hold me.

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.702
How do you know
it'll hold me?

01:29:19.703 --> 01:29:23.573
Because I'm 15,000 cheeseburgers
ahead of you in life.

01:29:23.574 --> 01:29:24.674
Come on.

01:30:05.816 --> 01:30:06.783
Hi.

01:30:28.906 --> 01:30:31.574
You from hammond?

01:30:31.575 --> 01:30:32.775
Chicago.

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.515
I'm from south bend
originally.

01:30:40.084 --> 01:30:42.019
Came to hammond
to look for work,

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.754
Me and my husband.

01:30:44.755 --> 01:30:47.090
He lost his job
in June.

01:30:47.091 --> 01:30:50.027
Worked for one of those
auto part companies

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:51.395
That went broke.

01:30:53.097 --> 01:30:55.632
We've been here
for about a week.

01:30:55.633 --> 01:30:56.966
It's nice.

01:30:58.969 --> 01:31:03.140
We was living out of
the back of our car.

01:31:03.141 --> 01:31:04.574
That's kind of hard.

01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:07.577
What about you?

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:13.616
We got here tonight.

01:31:13.617 --> 01:31:15.419
You and your daddy?

01:31:30.083 --> 01:31:31.584
Yeah.

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:36.856
Do you have a mother?

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:43.863
But she's not with you,
though, huh?

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:50.036
Where's she at,
chicago?

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:52.706
Yeah.

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:55.375
And I bet you'd like to
be with her right now,

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.609
Wouldn't you?

01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:58.211
Yes.

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:02.014
Yeah...

01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:03.616
I would.

01:32:03.617 --> 01:32:05.952
It'll happen.

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.223
Hope so.

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:14.527
That's all any of us
in here can do.

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:17.364
What?

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:18.565
Hope.

01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:31.177
You better
get some sleep.

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:32.645
Okay.

01:32:54.334 --> 01:32:55.368
Hey, doyle.

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:59.338
While you were
brushing your teeth,

01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:00.573
I called your mom.

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.909
I told her we were
at the holiday inn

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:05.445
So she wouldn't worry.
Is that okay?

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.214
Yeah.

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:10.617
You know, 'cause I said
I wouldn't call.

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:12.452
No...

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.554
No, that's okay.

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:15.688
Good night.

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.539
Did you hear me talking?

01:33:33.891 --> 01:33:35.792
No, not really.

01:33:35.793 --> 01:33:38.128
Well, I meant it.

01:33:42.032 --> 01:33:44.100
I appreciate it.

01:33:58.816 --> 01:34:01.885
You still gonna shoot me
in the ass?

01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:09.926
Yes.

01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:16.933
Good night.

01:34:25.876 --> 01:34:32.782
¶ beyond the blue horizon ¶

01:34:32.783 --> 01:34:39.205
¶ waits a beautiful day ¶

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:45.695
¶ good-bye to things
that bore me ¶

01:34:45.696 --> 01:34:51.668
¶ joy is waiting for me ¶

01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:57.674
¶ I see the new horizon ¶

01:34:57.675 --> 01:35:04.347
¶ my life has only begun ¶

01:35:04.348 --> 01:35:09.819
¶ beyond
the blue horizon... ¶

01:35:11.389 --> 01:35:12.488
That's them.

01:35:18.195 --> 01:35:20.997
He'll be so happy
to see you.

01:35:46.506 --> 01:35:48.340
Hello, natalie.

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:54.264
I'm sorry.

01:35:54.265 --> 01:35:56.232
Were you expecting
the mailman?

01:36:43.981 --> 01:36:46.483
You take care,
the both of you, now.

01:36:46.484 --> 01:36:47.784
Now, you call
the office

01:36:47.785 --> 01:36:49.118
First thing
Monday morning.

01:36:49.119 --> 01:36:50.920
I'll see what
I can do for you.

01:36:50.921 --> 01:36:53.656
Doyle, happy
thanksgiving.

01:36:53.657 --> 01:36:54.657
Thanks.

01:36:54.658 --> 01:36:55.658
Good luck.

01:36:55.659 --> 01:36:56.659
Okay.

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:57.794
Happy thanksgiving.

01:37:29.527 --> 01:37:31.027
Hey, buddy!

01:37:31.028 --> 01:37:32.328
Surprise.

01:37:32.329 --> 01:37:33.329
Huh?

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.743
Mom...

01:38:44.267 --> 01:38:46.870
I'm sorry.
Could you step outside?

01:38:46.871 --> 01:38:48.738
This is a family matter.

01:38:57.481 --> 01:39:00.082
Why don't you say
good-bye to your mother?

01:39:00.083 --> 01:39:02.001
Why don't you come
to my house?

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:04.771
We've got a lot
to talk about, huh?

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:09.341
I canceled an important
overseas trip

01:39:09.342 --> 01:39:11.277
To spend
this holiday with you.

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:14.113
No, you didn't.

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:17.750
I called your house
and a lady answered.

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:19.018
You lied to me.

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:21.087
Don't talk to me
that way.

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:23.455
It's true.

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:29.061
You make up your mind
right now, doyle.

01:39:29.062 --> 01:39:33.565
Are you coming with me,
or are you staying here?

01:39:33.566 --> 01:39:35.234
Your decision is final.

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:45.111
I'm staying here, dad.

01:39:57.174 --> 01:39:59.542
Well... Fine.

01:40:07.117 --> 01:40:09.686
I want you out of here
by Monday.

01:40:38.048 --> 01:40:39.148
Excuse me.

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.825
You wanted natalie
out by when?

01:40:48.826 --> 01:40:50.642
Monday.

01:40:50.643 --> 01:40:53.212
I'm sorry,
I didn't quite, uh...

01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:54.196
I said-

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920
Ehh...

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.340
Friday?

01:41:04.341 --> 01:41:07.593
Well, she's probably gonna
need a little more time.

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:10.863
Uh... How's 6 months
sound to you?

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:12.131
No problem.

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:13.900
And you'll be more
respectful to natalie?

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.334
Absolutely.

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:17.970
And you'll work on being
a nice guy with your son,

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:20.857
Because he still loves you.
He's a great kid.

01:41:20.858 --> 01:41:22.959
He doesn't deserve
having his feelings hurt

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.228
Or his mind played with,
especially not by his dad.

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:33.185
I like him a lot.
I'm his friend,

01:41:33.186 --> 01:41:35.121
But, see, I'm never
gonna be his father.

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:38.057
That's your job.
You better learn to do it.

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:40.259
Yes, sir.

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.544
Good.

01:41:45.282 --> 01:41:47.183
Pleasure
seeing you again.

01:41:49.152 --> 01:41:50.787
Happy holidays.

01:41:50.788 --> 01:41:52.054
Thank you-

01:41:52.055 --> 01:41:53.088
Thank you.

01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.628
Heh.

01:42:08.488 --> 01:42:09.872
Whoa!

01:42:11.675 --> 01:42:12.875
I'm okay.

01:42:24.021 --> 01:42:25.888
And here it is.

01:42:27.024 --> 01:42:28.191
Oh, wow.

01:42:28.192 --> 01:42:29.425
Thank you, dear.

01:42:29.426 --> 01:42:31.560
- Isn't he a beauty?
- Looks good.

01:42:33.797 --> 01:42:35.331
Uh, dave...

01:42:35.332 --> 01:42:36.666
Yeah?

01:42:36.667 --> 01:42:38.668
Before we start,
run in the other room

01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:40.169
And get my coat,
will you?

01:42:40.170 --> 01:42:42.271
I got something in there
for your mother.

01:42:43.923 --> 01:42:45.992
Right now?
Yeah.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:48.127
Can't it wait?

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:49.862
Well, it's something
very special.

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:53.099
Okay.

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:57.854
