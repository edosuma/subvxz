WEBVTT

00:35.200 --> 00:37.920
Why did you leave me for so long?

00:41.000 --> 00:45.640
I'm sorry. I needed time to think.
I want us to be together.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.240
-Hi.
-Hi!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.760
Hi, honey!

00:53.840 --> 00:59.040
-Here's to Kim.
-Here's to having you back.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.240
Wait...

01:07.560 --> 01:13.120
-Hi, Misha.
-Don't you have connections on Åland?

01:13.200 --> 01:18.560
Just get in the boat
and meet up with me at sea.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.520
Take the stuff and stash it.

01:22.600 --> 01:28.440
-Any survivors?
-Probably not, the water's too cold.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.360
-From here?
-Estonia, they think.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.840
Move.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.240
What the hell...?

02:12.640 --> 02:15.840
Why are we here?

02:16.640 --> 02:19.360
What was so important?

02:24.640 --> 02:27.480
What the hell is that?

02:27.560 --> 02:32.560
Your father, my brother. Mauritz.

02:33.960 --> 02:38.880
You must recognise his ring.
He got it from me.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.680
THICKER THAN WATER

04:07.560 --> 04:12.360
-I want the truth from you.
-What truth?

04:12.440 --> 04:17.960
I know that Anna-Lisa murdered
Mauritz, and I know that you know.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.800
We don't know anything.
Dad disappeared when we were kids.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.120
You weren't a kid.
You didn't even live here back then.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.200
And yet you speak for everybody.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.480
We don't know what happened.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.720
Dad was an alcoholic. He probably
fell in the water and drowned.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.240
Rotten luck he had
when he fell into a plastic bag.

04:44.320 --> 04:49.680
Mauritz wasn't easy to deal with,
but he didn't deserve to be murdered.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.320
I know that Anna-Lisa killed him

04:53.400 --> 04:59.400
and you disposed of the body.
That's what you dug up last summer.

04:59.480 --> 05:06.320
Did Anna-Lisa confess where
the body was buried before she died?

05:06.400 --> 05:09.600
Konrad,
whatever happened is in the past.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.160
Mum is dead, so what do you want?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.920
-I want the truth!
-What truth?!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.840
I want the truth on paper!

05:18.920 --> 05:23.720
There hasn't been one day
when I didn't think about this!

05:23.800 --> 05:30.120
I want closure!
Then I'll leave you alone.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.560
-Or else...
-Or else what?

05:35.360 --> 05:39.480
How many people want to stay at
a murdering family's inn?

05:39.560 --> 05:43.960
-Let's go.
-Or an arsonist's inn?!

05:44.040 --> 05:48.640
Word travels fast
on a small island like Åland.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.040
-Let's go.
-I want it on paper!

05:51.120 --> 05:53.760
Go to hell!

06:19.200 --> 06:24.200
-Oskar, don't drink any more.
-The old man is crazy.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.160
Let's go to the police
before he does.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.800
Konrad won't go to the police.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.000
Are you sure that was Dad?

06:35.080 --> 06:38.400
-It was his ring.
-Are you really sure?

06:38.480 --> 06:41.720
He always twisted it before
smacking us, so yeah, I'm sure.

06:41.800 --> 06:47.640
It will never be over. There's
no escape, it will haunt us forever.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.800
Oskar, he doesn't have any evidence.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.000
Liv doesn't know, and Cecilia...

06:53.080 --> 06:58.800
Take it easy. Lasse is right,
there's no evidence.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.920
Hi.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.880
-Are you celebrating something?
-Yes, the proceeds from the opening.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.520
Okay. Do you have time to help out?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.120
Sure thing.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.080
Dad...

07:29.880 --> 07:34.240
Did I get it right? Dad!

07:34.320 --> 07:37.560
What? Yeah, almost.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.200
The red wine glass
goes right in front of the plate.

07:42.400 --> 07:47.320
And that's a dessert fork,
not a salad fork. Where does it go?

07:48.240 --> 07:50.760
-On top of the plate?
-Yeah.

07:51.800 --> 07:56.040
-Can you show me how to serve?
-Yeah, sit down.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.880
Serve drinks from the right.
Leave the glass on the table.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.720
Use a cloth napkin
to catch any drops.

08:04.800 --> 08:09.000
Dad, you're pouring red wine
in the white wine glass.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.680
Thanks for the lesson, Dad.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.360
-So you got this now?
-Yeah, sure.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.960
See you later.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.080
Are you making tartar?
Tilt the knife a bit.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.400
I'm doing this my way.
I've managed all these years.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.800
What's with you?

08:35.560 --> 08:41.800
Nothing, I've just had a lot
on my plate lately, an awful lot.

08:41.880 --> 08:47.960
No more than usual. There are a lot
of people sharing the workload now.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.200
You can never be sure about people.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.840
Jonna and Lasse?
Things seem to be working.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.440
Yeah...

08:56.320 --> 08:58.720
Is it me you're not sure about?

08:59.600 --> 09:03.880
-Are you okay?
-Damn it!

09:05.000 --> 09:08.800
-I'm fine.
-Let me see.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.760
-Ouch! Does it hurt?
-No.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.520
You don't have to doubt me, Oskar.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.920
I'm staying with you.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.440
Thanks.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.720
You're welcome.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.480
Make sure you clean it properly.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.800
Hello.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.880
She's good.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.760
Can I get a napkin?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.480
-You think?
-Yeah.

11:16.560 --> 11:20.880
The guests like her,
and she seems happy.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.120
-Is it your first time here?
-Yes, but we'll be back.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.000
-How is it going?
-Fine. Here.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.160
I can't stop thinking about this
morning. Let's go to the police.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.440
-No way.
-We can't leave our dad there.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.240
-Think about Oskar.
-That's why.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.440
If we go to the police,
Konrad has nothing on us.

11:48.520 --> 11:53.520
He's crazy. What would he do if he
found out Oskar killed his brother?

11:53.600 --> 11:58.160
-Do you want me to talk to him?
-No, I'll think of something else.

11:58.240 --> 12:02.800
-He's not that impossible...
-Jonna, no!

12:02.880 --> 12:04.400
Okay...

12:43.320 --> 12:47.120
Get a statement
from the fisherman who found him.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.560
Hi. We're done here.

13:27.920 --> 13:33.080
-Let's take care of the attic first.
-I'll turn the lights on.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.800
That's good.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.080
-You go ahead. I'll be right there.
-Okay.

13:40.160 --> 13:44.080
Hi. I need to talk to you
about something.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.880
I don't have time, I'm just leaving.

13:46.960 --> 13:52.160
-It's about work.
-Talk to Lasse or Oskar.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.480
-Anything else?
-Let's forget what happened.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.960
Yeah, sure.
I've already forgotten it.

14:05.040 --> 14:10.400
Okay, great.
I'll talk to Oskar or Lasse.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.240
-Can I get you anything?
-No, thanks.

14:39.320 --> 14:44.000
-Not even soda water and sugar?
-What?

14:44.960 --> 14:48.360
You got that as a kid,
soda water and a sugar cube.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.920
Oh, right. I thought that
was how you made actual soda.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.280
I kept waiting for him to come back.

15:03.360 --> 15:08.840
Me too. But deep down,
I knew it would never happen.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.960
We never knew what dad was thinking.

15:12.040 --> 15:16.960
I did. He would never
have left you voluntarily.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.160
No...

15:24.240 --> 15:27.400
For a while, I thought
it was all my fault.

15:27.480 --> 15:31.440
If I could just be good,
he would come back home.

15:31.520 --> 15:36.440
No, it wasn't your fault.
You were just a kid.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.280
Listen...

15:42.600 --> 15:43.880
Yeah?

15:47.840 --> 15:51.200
I feel like I'm forgetting him.

15:51.280 --> 15:57.600
Mum got rid of everything when he
disappeared. I have no memories.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.560
I can imagine.

16:01.320 --> 16:07.360
But listen, I kept a box
with some of his stuff.

16:07.440 --> 16:12.160
You can have it. It's nothing
valuable, but if you want it...

16:44.400 --> 16:46.120
Hi.

16:46.200 --> 16:51.640
I was just going to call you,
later this afternoon.

16:51.720 --> 16:56.240
What's wrong? Why don't you answer
when I call you?

16:57.080 --> 17:01.280
-Sure I do...
-You ignore my calls.

17:01.360 --> 17:07.440
I'm sorry, we've been busy with
the Christmas dinners. We're full up.

17:07.520 --> 17:12.360
Could we maybe
talk things over tonight?

17:12.440 --> 17:15.200
Talk things over? Just tell me now.

17:15.280 --> 17:20.400
We can meet if you want to,
but I have to get to work now.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.640
Is she back?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.520
With you?

17:31.600 --> 17:34.400
She lives here.
This is her home, too.

17:34.480 --> 17:39.560
-Is that why you've ignored me?
-Keep it down.

17:39.640 --> 17:43.480
-What's it going to be?
-I don't know.

17:45.800 --> 17:50.120
-I didn't expect her to come back.
-So I was your second choice?

17:50.200 --> 17:55.200
Yes. Or no...
It's not like you make it sound.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.040
You know I like you a lot.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.680
You need to decide.
None of us want to share you.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.680
I get that, but can we talk about
it tomorrow? I'll drop by your place.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.080
-Something wrong?
-No... Well, yes.

18:25.160 --> 18:30.800
Not between me and Petra,
but between Petra and God.

18:30.880 --> 18:35.080
-She quit.
-So she's not a priest anymore?

18:35.160 --> 18:39.360
Apparently not. I think it's a shame.

18:39.440 --> 18:45.640
To give up a part of your life.
Don't you think it's a shame?

18:45.720 --> 18:47.080
Yeah...

18:48.200 --> 18:49.600
Oh well.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.920
-Hi.
-Hi there.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.320
Listen. I need to ask you a favour.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.240
I've had some unforeseen expenses.

21:04.320 --> 21:09.360
We needed a lot more material
for the cellar.

21:09.440 --> 21:14.320
And... I need an advance.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.680
-5,000 euros.
-An advance...?

21:19.760 --> 21:24.440
-You said 60 days credit.
-I didn't know how big the job was.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.880
We only hired you
because you offered us credit.

21:28.960 --> 21:33.560
No, you hired me
because there was no one else.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.880
I accepted
because you seemed desperate.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.280
More money...
Nothing's been done yet.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.240
Nothing's been done?
Come and have a look.

21:45.320 --> 21:49.480
-I don't have time for that...
-Come on!

21:55.720 --> 21:59.760
See? Those tiles are the exact
same colour as the old ones.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.760
If you're not happy,
I can take it all down.

22:02.840 --> 22:07.840
Without an advance, I have to
stop working. It's up to you.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.440
Aren't we supposed to have
mulled wine now?

22:33.520 --> 22:40.000
Sure, but we'll have it
up at the house, so we can keep warm.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.840
-We'll have it inside. Was it fun?
-Yeah, great.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.720
There you go.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.120
Thanks.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.520
Jonna?

23:01.360 --> 23:03.000
Jonna?

23:26.640 --> 23:30.280
What are you doing? That's Dad's.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.600
Give it back. I got it from Konrad.

23:32.680 --> 23:36.480
-Did you go see him?
-Yes, I can make my own decisions.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.280
-Give it here!
-I don't want his stuff here.

23:39.360 --> 23:45.320
-You don't have to be in my room!
-Why are you arguing? What's that?

23:45.400 --> 23:47.400
-Mauritz's old stuff.
-I don't want it here.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.240
-Get out of here!
-Lasse, we need to talk.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.920
-Give it here.
-Get rid of it.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.160
-Where's your focus?
-What do you mean?

23:58.240 --> 24:01.120
The dock, the mulled wine.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.040
I'm sorry.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.800
-What is it?
-What is she doing?

24:14.880 --> 24:17.600
I don't know.
Retroactive grief, I guess.

24:17.680 --> 24:21.840
-Who grieves for that bastard?
-She remembers him differently.

24:21.920 --> 24:26.200
-What is it?
-We have a problem.

24:27.480 --> 24:31.200
-Wille wants an advance.
-An advance?

24:31.280 --> 24:35.640
-Unforeseen expenses.
-Is that what he said?

24:35.720 --> 24:40.840
-That stupid clown!
-Our suppliers are chasing us.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.920
-Just pay them.
-With what money?

24:45.000 --> 24:48.960
-Do we have any insurance money left?
-The place is almost full.

24:49.040 --> 24:55.520
Mainly conferences. We invoice them
at the end of the month.

24:56.720 --> 25:01.080
I can ask our suppliers
for some more time,

25:01.160 --> 25:04.720
but that Finnish ex-con
is a different story.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.840
Hey... 5,000 euros.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.800
Thanks.

25:52.880 --> 25:56.000
I hope all other expenses
can be foreseen.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.000
Yeah, I hope so, too.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.640
-Aren't you going to count it?
-Why?

26:03.720 --> 26:08.480
You're trustworthy, Lasse.
I can tell.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.360
It's busier than we thought.

26:16.440 --> 26:21.840
It would be great
if you can start this weekend.

26:22.920 --> 26:28.400
That would be great.
Thank you. Talk to you later.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.200
-Did you find Lasse or Oskar?
-Yeah, it all worked out.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.120
Do you want a cup of tea?

27:02.520 --> 27:04.400
I've got it.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.560
-Milk?
-No, thanks.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.880
What are you reading?

27:11.960 --> 27:16.360
My dad's old notebook. His diary.

27:16.440 --> 27:21.600
He died a long time ago.
It's like getting to know him again.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.720
What's so funny?

27:24.800 --> 27:31.600
Nothing. I just can't imagine
my dad writing anything.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.840
I've never even seen him
write a grocery list.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.000
My dad was a writer.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.520
So what did he write?

27:42.600 --> 27:47.040
It's mostly his own thoughts.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.760
Some drafts and stuff.

27:50.840 --> 27:55.360
You can tell that he
found inspiration in his own life.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.480
He was very unstable.
His mood would change suddenly.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.200
He was an alcoholic.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.800
That sounds more familiar.

28:04.880 --> 28:09.040
-Your dad as well?
-No, my mum.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.920
-It's not easy growing up with them.
-But he was also very loving.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.360
Much more so than my mother.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.880
I was loyal to him,
despite how he was.

28:25.960 --> 28:28.920
Yeah, that's how it is.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.840
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.600
-What are you doing?
-Emptying nets.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.920
-Did you catch anything?
-Yeah.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.800
-Is he still down there?
-Yes.

28:58.880 --> 29:05.360
-Are you going to call the police?
-This is strictly a family matter.

29:05.920 --> 29:10.200
-Shouldn't he get a proper funeral?
-All in good time.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.520
-Did you know he kept a diary?
-Really?

29:16.000 --> 29:19.120
It was in the box you gave me.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.680
-The notebook?
-Yeah.

29:22.680 --> 29:26.120
It brings back memories
from my childhood.

29:26.200 --> 29:30.160
I understand if you want to know
what happened to dad,

29:30.240 --> 29:36.840
but it brings back painful memories
and you need to try to let it go.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.560
-Please, Konrad.
-No.

29:39.640 --> 29:44.480
You have to try to forgive or forget.
Let it go.

29:44.560 --> 29:49.200
I can't. That would be betraying
my brother, my own blood.

29:49.280 --> 29:53.040
-We're your blood, too.
-Yes, unfortunately.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.360
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME
THROUGH A TOUGH TIME,

30:36.440 --> 30:39.560
BUT LIV AND I HAVE TO TRY
TO FIX OUR MARRIAGE AGAIN.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.640
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND. OSKAR

30:58.280 --> 31:03.280
I'm going for a run.
What does it say?

31:03.360 --> 31:07.920
They found the body
of someone who drowned.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.280
-Someone you knew?
-No, I don't think so.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.160
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.440
DROWNED MAN FOUND

32:02.240 --> 32:06.920
He drowned maybe a week ago.
Hard to tell when the water's cold.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.480
Misha Aarvik from Sweden.
He had his ID on him.

32:11.560 --> 32:16.640
He's not on any passenger list
and he's not reported missing.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.920
-The bullet entered here.
-Bullet?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.560
Yes, there it is.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.560
-Any burns on the body?
-No, why?

32:36.640 --> 32:39.960
We found a boat that had burned.

32:40.040 --> 32:43.720
-Do you think there's a connection?
-I don't know.

32:43.800 --> 32:47.840
If there is,
there were more people on the boat.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.000
A sweet bun, please.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.120
3 euros.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.400
-Feel like a snack?
-Hi.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.720
-Sugar helps you think.
-Sure.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.960
Hi. We didn't have time to bake
this morning. I need ten baguettes.

33:34.040 --> 33:38.360
-How's business?
-We're really busy.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.600
I'm already sick of Christmas food.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.680
It's only natural.
I don't really like Christmas food.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.240
30 euros.

33:48.320 --> 33:54.880
-I've never eaten at Waldemar's.
-What? Are you kidding me?

33:54.960 --> 33:56.920
Thanks. Bye.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.080
Are the police busy around Christmas?

34:00.160 --> 34:06.520
Some burglaries when people are away
and a few family spats.

34:06.600 --> 34:10.640
The holidays tend to
stir up emotions.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.480
Yeah, I know.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.640
This Christmas will be special
because of the storm.

34:16.720 --> 34:19.360
I can imagine.

34:19.440 --> 34:25.360
I read you found a drowned man.
Was he from the boat that burned?

34:25.440 --> 34:28.040
We don't know for sure.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.040
Was he from Estonia or from here?

34:31.120 --> 34:33.200
Why do you ask?

34:34.160 --> 34:39.680
I wonder what would have happened
if I'd gotten there a bit sooner.

34:39.760 --> 34:43.400
-If you could have saved him?
-Is that so strange?

34:43.480 --> 34:47.600
-Don't think too much about it.
-I can't help it.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.840
If I'd gotten closer,
he might have made it.

34:50.920 --> 34:56.080
Nothing points to him being on the
boat, and even if he was...

34:56.160 --> 34:58.840
He might not have made it anyway.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.200
Really? Was he hurt?

35:01.280 --> 35:04.680
-I've already told you too much.
-I understand, sorry.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.880
Good luck thinking. Bring your boy
and drop by to eat some night.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.920
-Will we get homemade bread?
-Of course. Bye.

35:21.160 --> 35:25.320
I bought some bread.
What needs doing? Ham?

35:25.400 --> 35:27.400
Ham, salad, pirogues, herring.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.320
-Beet salad, meatballs, sausage...
-I get it.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.280
-Did you read about this?
-Yeah.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.880
Can you get Jonna?
She's scheduled to work.

35:36.960 --> 35:40.440
She felt ill last night.
I'll see if she's better.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.960
Jonna?

35:45.160 --> 35:46.720
Jonna!

36:26.360 --> 36:28.760
<i>Sunday, August 11.</i>

36:30.120 --> 36:33.080
<i>We are reaching</i>
<i>a point we can't avoid...</i>

36:33.960 --> 36:36.040
<i>One of us must go.</i>

36:37.280 --> 36:39.440
<i>We both know it.</i>

36:49.800 --> 36:54.040
Stab me. Stab me, you bastard!

36:55.160 --> 36:56.440
Stab me!

36:57.960 --> 36:59.480
Damn coward.

37:16.520 --> 37:20.280
-Oskar...
-What is it?

37:20.360 --> 37:23.520
I don't think Konrad will give in.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.440
I asked him to let it go,
but he refused.

37:28.520 --> 37:33.520
-You can't keep going to him.
-But he would understand.

37:33.600 --> 37:38.000
-If we tell him, he'll let it go.
-Never.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.880
It was self-defence, Oskar.
Of course he'll understand.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.640
I killed his brother.
People don't forgive that.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.560
It's for your sake as well, Oskar.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.280
What are you doing? Oskar?

37:56.320 --> 37:59.000
We need to tell Konrad.

37:59.080 --> 38:02.200
He wants to put it behind him.
We have to.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.400
-Listen to me, Lasse!
-Get out of here!

38:05.480 --> 38:07.720
-Lasse...
-Get out.

38:11.320 --> 38:16.560
Look at me, Oskar.
I'll take care of Konrad.

38:16.640 --> 38:21.520
He needs to go. Konrad needs to go.

38:54.560 --> 38:58.120
-What was that about?
-Some old man...

38:58.200 --> 39:00.960
No, I mean in the kitchen.

39:01.040 --> 39:05.120
Our finances aren't as good
as we hoped.

39:05.200 --> 39:09.040
-Finances?
-Things will turn around.

39:10.360 --> 39:15.280
One day you celebrate your finances,
and the next day you're fighting.

39:15.360 --> 39:18.600
There are always ups and downs.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.760
What I like about you
is your honesty.

39:21.840 --> 39:27.400
I'm used to your brothers lying,
but I thought you were different.

39:33.560 --> 39:37.480
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.080
-Are you okay?
-Sure.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.680
I'm fine.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.960
Here. Take that and leave us alone.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.120
It's 50,000 euros.

41:37.200 --> 41:41.040
Forget about anything in writing.
That's what you get.

41:42.080 --> 41:47.280
Now shut up about the past.
I don't want to hear a peep from you.

41:47.360 --> 41:51.040
Take it easy. I get it.

42:24.560 --> 42:29.000
Felony robbery,
fencing stolen goods and so on.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.240
Misha Aarvik was famous.

42:31.320 --> 42:36.880
Could it be a deal of some sort?
Maybe smuggling?

42:38.680 --> 42:42.640
-We just got that.
-Have they found Andrus Ilves?

42:42.720 --> 42:45.360
-Who?
-The owner of the boat.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.720
Not as far as I know.

42:48.800 --> 42:53.880
By the way, the gas station owner
Mäntylä called and was pissed.

42:53.960 --> 42:57.480
-He got a fake 50 euro bill.
-Oh well.

42:57.560 --> 43:01.320
I wanted to mention it.
It's the third one this week.

43:11.760 --> 43:15.760
