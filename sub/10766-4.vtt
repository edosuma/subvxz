00:06.552 --> 00:08.952
These kids have got to be
more sensitive to these bills.

00:09.021 --> 00:11.922
I mean, look at them, they're...
Out of sight.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.426
- Philip, stop looking at my chest.
- I'm sorry, honey.

00:15.861 --> 00:17.954
It's just that
ever since you've been pregnant...

00:18.196 --> 00:19.959
they're back.

00:21.366 --> 00:23.926
Is that all I am to you is a bustline?

00:25.771 --> 00:27.864
I'm sorry. Did you say something, honey?

00:30.809 --> 00:32.470
- Hey, morning, y'all.
- Hey, baby.

00:32.543 --> 00:34.774
Hey, check this out, Aunt Viv.

00:36.648 --> 00:37.876
What are you doing?

00:37.950 --> 00:41.647
I learned in biology class that,
you know, babies can respond to music...

00:41.720 --> 00:42.914
while they still in the womb.

00:42.988 --> 00:44.717
Y ou know,
like when you was carrying Carlton...

00:44.790 --> 00:47.088
you kept listening to
<i>/t's a Sma// Wor/d After A//?</i>

00:47.593 --> 00:49.424
Oh, the baby's kicking.
Who's that singing?

00:49.494 --> 00:51.189
Just a little Heavy D for Heavy V.

00:51.797 --> 00:55.096
Will, it's bad enough
you have an influence on Ashley.

00:55.167 --> 00:56.566
Hands off the fetus.

00:58.370 --> 01:01.498
All right, look, well, come on,
can we at least make the kid be righteous?

01:01.573 --> 01:04.041
Y ou know, like let him have
an African name like...

01:04.108 --> 01:05.440
Brother Outaphilia.

01:07.145 --> 01:09.477
Oh, hey, check it out, I got him a gift.

01:13.452 --> 01:14.976
Little itty-bitty X cap.

01:16.755 --> 01:18.552
Little teeny-weeny Doc Martens.

01:19.091 --> 01:20.820
Too cool for pre-school, right?

01:21.627 --> 01:24.152
Will, honey, why all this sudden interest
in the baby?

01:24.930 --> 01:26.488
Well, I mean...

01:26.798 --> 01:29.392
I've been able to save Ashley, but...

01:29.468 --> 01:31.368
as far as your other two kids...

01:31.436 --> 01:33.927
Let's just say they a couple of wings short
of a bucket.

01:35.407 --> 01:38.968
Just one minute, there is nothing wrong
with Hilary and Carlton.

01:39.044 --> 01:41.069
Daddy, how do you expect me
to support myself...

01:41.146 --> 01:43.273
if you don't increase your credit card limit.

01:44.716 --> 01:47.708
Dad, I decided
to throw caution to the wind.

01:48.820 --> 01:50.014
V-neck!

01:52.524 --> 01:55.084
Coincidence? I think not.

01:56.194 --> 01:57.456
Allow me.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.372 --> 03:17.569
- Dad, I'd like to try something out on you.
- Carlton, please.

03:17.642 --> 03:20.270
Do I have to sit through
your Urkel impression again?

03:21.179 --> 03:24.444
Maybe later, but right now I've been
reading this book on negotiating...

03:24.516 --> 03:26.677
- and I'd like to practice my technique.
- No.

03:28.420 --> 03:31.548
I'm gonna look you straight in the eye
and ask you again.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.652
No, and get some Binaca.

03:39.731 --> 03:41.699
Come on, big guy, work with me.

03:43.101 --> 03:44.966
I'd like a raise in my allowance.

03:46.438 --> 03:48.929
- All right, how much?
- $75,000.

03:50.442 --> 03:53.206
- Are you insane?
- The book says start high.

03:53.278 --> 03:54.677
And obviously you are.

03:56.281 --> 03:59.375
- I'll give you $3 more a week.
- Gee, thanks, Dad.

03:59.451 --> 04:01.578
Now I can stop taking money
from your wallet.

04:03.588 --> 04:06.148
Sorry, Margo,
I can't make the Neiman sale.

04:06.224 --> 04:09.990
No, now that I'm living on my own
I have to do my own grocery shopping.

04:10.662 --> 04:13.222
I know. Okay, bye.

04:13.632 --> 04:16.567
Hilary, honey, I'm really proud of you.

04:16.635 --> 04:18.728
I don't think
you've ever gone grocery shopping.

04:18.803 --> 04:21.534
Well, I guess it's time I spread my wings.

04:37.756 --> 04:40.088
This is the last time I shop here for fruit.

04:43.061 --> 04:45.996
Oh, that's okay, Daddy.
Y ou don't have to carry it, I'm a big girl.

04:54.739 --> 04:57.230
Let go, Daddy. Do your own shopping.

04:58.376 --> 05:01.709
Dad, if you'd put a bell around her neck
we'd at least know when she was coming.

05:01.780 --> 05:03.748
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Okey-dokey.

05:05.150 --> 05:08.950
Hilary, you're a 23-year-old woman
living in your parents' pool house.

05:09.087 --> 05:10.918
Y ou haven't had a job in over two months.

05:10.989 --> 05:13.890
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I'm not pregnant.

05:15.861 --> 05:16.885
Honey...

05:17.596 --> 05:18.824
Sweetheart...

05:19.831 --> 05:21.822
I don't want to be too hard on you.

05:22.734 --> 05:24.531
The hell I don't. Get a job.

05:26.071 --> 05:28.471
Why don't you just beat me
with a wire hanger?

05:30.575 --> 05:32.338
Y o, yo, my posse, check it out.

05:32.410 --> 05:35.846
In less than five minutes, yours truly
is going to be on the 6:00 news.

05:35.914 --> 05:37.279
And without handcuffs.

05:38.283 --> 05:41.013
What, they use the old choke hold?
This I got to see.

05:41.820 --> 05:44.050
No, no, it was a peaceful protest.

05:44.489 --> 05:46.320
Would even made Gandhi proud.

05:46.625 --> 05:49.253
Y ou know, except we went out
for burgers afterwards.

05:52.230 --> 05:53.822
Well, what were you protesting, Will?

05:53.899 --> 05:56.766
Well, you know, the city wants
to tear down the rec center on Pico...

05:56.835 --> 05:58.769
so a couple of us got together,
started a petition.

05:58.837 --> 06:01.362
Y ou know, we get enough signatures,
we might be able to save it.

06:01.439 --> 06:03.498
So, when did you become
so socially conscious?

06:03.575 --> 06:07.102
Well, you know, I play ball down there,
and plus it's good for the community.

06:09.414 --> 06:11.541
And there's also this girl down there
on the swim team.

06:11.616 --> 06:13.243
She teaching me the breaststroke.

06:18.123 --> 06:20.353
Come on, you guys, the news is starting.

06:20.892 --> 06:22.052
- <i>Tear it down.</i>
- <i>Save the rec.</i>

06:24.796 --> 06:27.788
- <i>Save the rec.</i>
- <i>Tear it down.</i>

06:28.400 --> 06:33.030
<i>/'m standing outside the LA</i>
<i>Recreationa/ Center on Pico Bou/evard.</i>

06:33.238 --> 06:36.867
<i>The peop/e you see behind me</i>
<i>a// have one thing in common.</i>

06:37.208 --> 06:38.573
Y eah, polyester.

06:41.479 --> 06:45.313
<i>E</i> xcept for that guy
holding the microphone. He's kind of cute.

06:45.383 --> 06:47.180
I wonder why I've never seen him before.

06:47.252 --> 06:50.312
Probably 'cause this is the news
and he's never been on <i>Studs.</i>

06:52.524 --> 06:55.322
Doesn't matter.
He wouldn't be interested in me anyway.

06:55.527 --> 06:58.189
I have no job. I have no self-esteem.

06:58.997 --> 07:01.056
- I'm nobody.
- Shut up!

07:03.068 --> 07:04.797
We're trying to hear the TV.

07:07.806 --> 07:11.742
<i>This p/ace is a magnet for urban decay.</i>
<i>/'ve been mugged here twice.</i>

07:12.243 --> 07:14.404
<i>/ say tear the sucker down.</i>

07:17.749 --> 07:20.912
<i>Of course, not everyone fe/t the same way.</i>

07:21.386 --> 07:22.819
Here we go, here we go.

07:22.954 --> 07:26.651
<i>/'m for the rec center because that's</i>
<i>where / do most of my rec centering.</i>

07:26.758 --> 07:30.421
<i>And when /'m not down with R-E-C,</i>
<i>/'m down with R-A-P.</i>

07:31.663 --> 07:34.154
<i>When / got home /ate</i>
<i>from the grocery store</i>

07:34.232 --> 07:36.291
<i>Mama said, "Lock him out!"</i>

07:36.634 --> 07:40.593
<i>Now / know why Pops had to go</i>
<i>'Cause Mama is way whacked out!</i>

07:41.239 --> 07:43.207
<i>Mama is way whacked out!</i>

07:46.211 --> 07:47.678
<i>Good /uck, homey.</i>

07:48.646 --> 07:50.409
I don't believe that mess.

07:50.482 --> 07:54.043
Y ou know, it's the same thing every time
they interview a black person on TV.

07:54.119 --> 07:55.746
They either singing or dancing.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.687
And they got curlers in their head
or out of activator.

07:58.823 --> 08:01.417
Y ou know, Will,
that really makes you think.

08:02.594 --> 08:03.891
What's activator?

08:04.429 --> 08:07.728
Come on, man, you saw that story.
I mean, that ain't fair!

08:08.033 --> 08:09.625
Life isn't fair, Will.

08:10.268 --> 08:12.736
I mean, was it fair
when Bambi's mother died?

08:14.139 --> 08:17.802
Or is it fair that the coyote
still can't catch the roadrunner?

08:18.843 --> 08:22.244
Or how about Roger Rabbit?
How did he get a babe like that?

08:26.718 --> 08:29.710
Y ou know, Carlton, you're right.
Life isn't fair.

08:29.788 --> 08:33.155
Because if it was, then your legs
wouldn't be shorter than your arms.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.827
Hey, good morning.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.336
Hi, Carla, any calls?

08:46.404 --> 08:49.464
Just another Ionely white woman
wanting to sleep with you.

08:49.974 --> 08:51.965
Carla, that is very unprofessional.

08:52.077 --> 08:54.841
- Besides, how do you know she's white?
- She's my mother.

08:58.683 --> 08:59.945
Oh, forget it, Will.

09:00.018 --> 09:03.181
Trevor's not gonna be interested
in some unemployed freeloader.

09:04.689 --> 09:07.715
Now, come on, Hil, look,
your job is not your identity.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.124
I mean, you got a lot of other things
going for you.

09:10.195 --> 09:13.164
- Like what?
- Well, like the fact that you're...

09:13.998 --> 09:15.989
Well, well, you know that you're...

09:16.067 --> 09:19.525
y our hat always matches your shoes.

09:21.339 --> 09:23.330
Talk about missing the obvious.

09:24.042 --> 09:25.509
Thanks, Will.

09:30.448 --> 09:31.847
<i>E</i> xcuse me, miss...

09:31.916 --> 09:34.908
last night this station did
the crazy hatchet job on the rec center...

09:34.986 --> 09:37.386
and I want to talk to somebody
about it right now.

09:37.455 --> 09:41.357
That would be our producer, Howard,
but he doesn't talk to the viewing public.

09:42.227 --> 09:44.286
It causes his ulcer to bleed.

09:44.896 --> 09:48.525
Howard, there's someone here to see you.

09:50.802 --> 09:52.770
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

09:54.339 --> 09:55.670
- Oh, God.
- What?

09:55.740 --> 09:56.729
There's Trevor.

10:00.645 --> 10:01.737
Oops!

10:04.149 --> 10:07.141
I dropped my wallet.
Could you get that for me, please?

10:07.218 --> 10:11.052
Look, if your horny friend wants to meet
Trevor, he's down the hall to the right.

10:13.825 --> 10:16.419
But you'll have to fight my mother for him.

10:16.494 --> 10:17.586
Okay.

10:21.566 --> 10:24.228
- Somebody here to see me, Carla?
- An angry viewer.

10:24.302 --> 10:26.964
I'm going to lunch. See you tomorrow.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.876
Look, kid, I've got an emergency here.
I've got to find a new weather man.

10:32.944 --> 10:35.572
Whoa, look, I just need 30 seconds
on the air...

10:35.647 --> 10:38.172
to talk about why the rec center
shouldn't be torn down.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.078
<i>E</i> thnic is definitely a way to go.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.044
Y o, come on, man,
look, this ain't about color.

10:44.122 --> 10:47.023
Look, I ain't just some young rapper
trying to get on TV, man.

10:47.091 --> 10:48.490
Great legs.

10:50.762 --> 10:53.526
Thanks a lot, man.
Hey, but, look, I ain't dancing either.

10:53.598 --> 10:56.795
- Come on, this is serious.
- Look, kid, I gotta run.

10:57.502 --> 11:00.062
All right, look, I'll dance,
just no tap, all right?

11:00.138 --> 11:01.799
Maybe Mike here can help you.

11:01.873 --> 11:04.535
Look. Mike, I'm gonna cut to the chase.

11:04.609 --> 11:06.474
I need 30 seconds on the air
to talk about...

11:06.544 --> 11:09.035
why the rec center shouldn't
be torn down. Can you help me?

11:09.113 --> 11:13.072
I'm 60 and I'm pushing a mail cart.
Do I look like I can help you?

11:17.188 --> 11:20.487
<i>E</i> xcuse me. I'm Howard,
the producer of <i>News and Action.</i>

11:20.692 --> 11:23.160
- Could you do that again?
- Do what?

11:23.261 --> 11:26.992
Stand like you were before on your toes.
Only this time I'd like you to point.

11:32.203 --> 11:33.602
Incredible!

11:33.771 --> 11:35.671
How would you like to be a weather girl?

11:36.774 --> 11:38.639
I don't know the first thing about weather.

11:38.710 --> 11:40.143
Sure you do.

11:40.211 --> 11:43.647
- What happens when it rains?
- Y ou send Geoffrey out to get the car.

11:45.283 --> 11:46.409
Hey, yo, man.

11:46.484 --> 11:48.816
Look, I don't appreciate
being played off like this, right?

11:48.886 --> 11:51.684
This is 'cause I'm black, right?
That's why you won't put me on the air.

11:51.756 --> 11:53.246
Look, I'm on to your little scheme...

11:53.324 --> 11:56.487
and that one black anchor you got
just ain't gonna cut it.

11:56.961 --> 12:00.328
That's why I'm making her
our new weather girl.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.261
I love a screamer.

12:06.638 --> 12:10.369
Oh, Will, this is all thanks to you.
I owe you big time.

12:10.441 --> 12:13.239
No, Hil, this is great.
Now you can put me on the air.

12:13.311 --> 12:15.711
Forget it. What experience do you have?

12:25.056 --> 12:27.251
It's 'cause I'm black.
That's what the thing is.

12:27.325 --> 12:28.690
Hey, yo, I don't believe this.

12:28.993 --> 12:32.121
The news station won't let me come on
to talk about the petition.

12:33.331 --> 12:36.027
Will, Will, Will.

12:36.634 --> 12:40.263
Haven't you learned anything
living with me the past two years?

12:41.272 --> 12:43.172
What, you mean
other than the words to <i>Mandy?</i>

12:44.042 --> 12:46.704
I'm talking about <i>The Art of Negotiation...</i>

12:47.145 --> 12:49.409
and I'll be glad to share
my wisdom with you.

12:50.114 --> 12:52.480
No, no, no. Last time you shared
something with me...

12:52.550 --> 12:54.279
I was on antibiotics for two weeks.

12:56.921 --> 12:59.219
- Hi, boys.
- Hey, what's going on, Uncle Phil?

12:59.290 --> 13:02.919
So, Will. Have any luck
down at the news station?

13:03.194 --> 13:04.991
No, Uncle Phil. It was kind of weird, too.

13:05.063 --> 13:08.590
It was like no matter how much sense
I was making, the dude wouldn't listen.

13:08.666 --> 13:11.794
I don't know, it was almost like a...

13:12.303 --> 13:14.931
discrimination type thing or something.
I don't know.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.133
Boy, I wish I knew a lawyer.

13:19.110 --> 13:21.044
What are you talking about?
Y ou know me.

13:21.112 --> 13:22.238
- Y ou?
- Y eah.

13:22.313 --> 13:25.510
No, Uncle Phil, I mean, you're
this big-time lawyer and everything.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.381
I mean, you ain't got time
to help us little guys fight the system.

13:28.453 --> 13:31.388
I mean, now, you did back in the day
though. Y ou was the man back then.

13:31.456 --> 13:32.889
But, you know, now...

13:32.957 --> 13:35.619
Don't even worry about it, Uncle Phil.
It's all right.

13:36.728 --> 13:41.290
<i>We sha// overcome</i>

13:41.632 --> 13:44.601
Wait a minute, Will, who'd you meet with
down there at the station?

13:44.669 --> 13:46.330
Some producer named Howard, Uncle Phil.

13:46.404 --> 13:48.770
Well, I think it's time you and I
pay Howard another visit.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.808
- Y es, sir, it is.
- Nobody pushes my nephew around...

13:50.875 --> 13:52.570
- and gets away with it.
- No, sir, they do not.

13:52.643 --> 13:54.543
I will slap that place with so many
class-action suits...

13:54.612 --> 13:55.579
they won't know what hit them.

13:55.646 --> 13:56.635
- <i>We//...</i>
- Come on!

14:00.952 --> 14:03.420
Hi, everyone.
Did Will tell you the good news?

14:03.488 --> 14:05.479
- What?
- I got a job.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.424
- Hallelujah!
- Praise Jesus, let's go, Uncle Phil.

14:08.526 --> 14:12.121
No, no, no, wait a minute. Now, it's not
every day that my little baby gets a job.

14:12.196 --> 14:14.687
- So, what will you be doing?
- Okay, try to guess.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.896
A limo will pick me up and take me home.

14:18.336 --> 14:22.329
I'll make lots of money,
and I'll only have to work an hour a day.

14:23.441 --> 14:26.672
Oh, my God! She's gonna be a hooker!

14:29.414 --> 14:32.440
No, you idiot. I'm gonna be a weather girl.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.249
That is so great.
Get going, let's go, Uncle Phil.

14:35.319 --> 14:37.947
What a surprise! Y ou know, I didn't
even know you were up for the job.

14:38.022 --> 14:40.752
Well, I wasn't. It's all thanks to Will.

14:40.825 --> 14:43.020
Unlike you who kicked me
when I was down...

14:43.494 --> 14:47.897
Will took me by the hand and led me to
the news station to meet Trevor Collins.

14:48.466 --> 14:50.957
And, while I was there
this guy, Howard, offered me the job.

14:51.035 --> 14:52.593
I love Howard.

14:52.670 --> 14:55.161
Whoa, whoa, Uncle Phil, come on,
remember Howard's the enemy.

14:55.239 --> 14:56.604
Shut up, Will.

14:56.941 --> 14:58.238
Howard's a god.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.707
He performed a miracle. Hilary's working.

15:01.779 --> 15:04.111
With any luck, she'll be off my property
before I'm dead.

15:05.016 --> 15:07.484
So, sweetheart,
tell me about this Howard.

15:07.752 --> 15:09.549
Does he like cashmere?

15:18.162 --> 15:21.620
My man, Carlton. What's up
with this negotiating thing, man?

15:23.868 --> 15:26.336
Hop on one foot and say, "Carlton is king."

15:27.505 --> 15:28.836
Y ou know, I got a better idea.

15:28.906 --> 15:31.170
How about I squeeze your neck
till your head pops off?

15:32.210 --> 15:33.905
See, you're negotiating already.

15:41.352 --> 15:44.287
Y ou guys are the greatest.
Thanks for making sure I got here okay.

15:44.355 --> 15:46.255
Come on, Hil, that's what family's for.

15:46.324 --> 15:49.157
And besides, we never would have
gotten past security without you.

15:49.227 --> 15:51.695
- I don't understand.
- We were counting on that.

15:56.701 --> 15:58.999
Hi, Carla, any calls?

16:02.440 --> 16:03.873
All right, come on, man, let's break.

16:03.941 --> 16:05.431
I'm gonna demand to get on the air.

16:05.510 --> 16:08.536
Will, has all that hot sauce
finally gone to your brain?

16:08.980 --> 16:11.881
Look, there's a right way to negotiate
and a wrong way.

16:12.350 --> 16:13.817
Observe the right way.

16:15.186 --> 16:16.813
Hi, I'm here to see Howard.

16:16.954 --> 16:18.615
- Y our name?
- Bryant.

16:19.657 --> 16:21.591
Bryant Gumbel.

16:23.327 --> 16:25.056
And I'm Patti LaBelle.

16:26.597 --> 16:27.859
Beat it.

16:28.766 --> 16:31.860
Look, Patti, you seem like a no-nonsense
kind of slimmy, right?

16:31.936 --> 16:33.767
So, I'm gonna give it to you straight.

16:34.472 --> 16:36.702
Will, you gotta lie to get what you want.

16:36.774 --> 16:39.140
Didn't you watch
the Republican convention?

16:41.479 --> 16:44.004
Carlton, don't make me come down there.

16:46.617 --> 16:49.643
Look, it's like this.
I need 30 seconds on the air...

16:49.720 --> 16:52.018
to talk about why the rec center
shouldn't be torn down...

16:52.089 --> 16:54.683
and I don't care if I gotta force my way
on the set to get it.

16:54.759 --> 16:56.249
Let me get this straight.

16:56.327 --> 16:59.296
Y ou want to storm the set,
disrupt a live newscast...

16:59.363 --> 17:01.831
and jeopardize the credibility
of this station.

17:01.899 --> 17:04.265
- Y es.
- Will you be needing wardrobe?

17:09.373 --> 17:11.238
Five minutes to air, everybody.

17:12.577 --> 17:14.636
Oh, Hilary, before you go on...

17:14.712 --> 17:17.681
I'm going to tell you the same thing
I told Dan Rather.

17:18.115 --> 17:19.582
Wet your lips.

17:22.053 --> 17:23.315
Thank you.

17:32.029 --> 17:36.090
- So, how do you like the jacket?
- Incredible.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.734
Makes me look really buffed.

17:40.338 --> 17:42.238
It sure does.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.400
Hi, I'm Hilary Banks,
I'm your new weather girl.

17:45.476 --> 17:46.704
Well, welcome aboard.

17:46.777 --> 17:50.941
Y ou know the last person who had
your job was really special to me.

17:51.415 --> 17:52.882
I'm gonna miss Lou.

17:53.217 --> 17:55.651
- I thought his name was Jack.
- Whatever.

17:58.289 --> 17:59.347
Wow!

18:00.591 --> 18:01.751
I know.

18:03.861 --> 18:07.092
Hi, I'm Trevor Collins
and these are my real teeth.

18:08.933 --> 18:11.026
- Wow!
- I know.

18:13.704 --> 18:16.969
My God, you have incredible eyes.

18:17.308 --> 18:20.607
- Really?
- Y es, I can see myself in them.

18:22.246 --> 18:23.508
Don't blink.

18:26.217 --> 18:28.412
And to conclude our story
on the homeless...

18:28.486 --> 18:32.684
I'd like to leave you with something
a young girl named Dorothy once said...

18:33.157 --> 18:35.785
"There's no place like home, Auntie <i>E</i> m...

18:35.860 --> 18:38.658
"there's no place like home."

18:40.464 --> 18:41.658
Trevor.

18:42.099 --> 18:45.557
Well, on a brighter note,
Jack, our weather man, died.

18:46.103 --> 18:49.937
So, it is now with great pleasure
that I introduce the newest addition...

18:50.007 --> 18:53.204
to the <i>News and Action</i> team,
Hilary Banks.

18:53.511 --> 18:57.106
- How's it looking for tonight?
- Very promising.

19:03.988 --> 19:06.980
Here in Southern California,
we're experiencing a warm front...

19:07.058 --> 19:08.616
with increasing humidity.

19:08.726 --> 19:11.217
That's right, girls, it's a frizzy-hair day.

19:16.033 --> 19:19.196
Looking at the nation, oh...

19:19.270 --> 19:22.933
Looking at the nation, there's a cold front
blowing in from the Atlantic...

19:24.408 --> 19:26.933
with a high probability of rain
in the Midwest.

19:28.345 --> 19:31.337
The South, however,
will enjoy pleasant and sunny weather.

19:32.216 --> 19:34.980
So, if you're planning
on going to the beaches, remember...

19:35.052 --> 19:38.317
you can help keep America beautiful
with two simple words...

19:38.389 --> 19:39.686
Jenny Craig.

19:43.794 --> 19:47.230
Now, let's go look at our big board
for the local weather for the week.

19:47.965 --> 19:49.057
Will!

19:49.967 --> 19:53.232
That's right, Will Smith here
on community feedback.

19:53.304 --> 19:56.637
Today's topic is the petition to save
the Los Angeles Rec Center.

19:56.707 --> 20:00.165
See, the rec center for a lot of us is, you
know, it's like a home away from home.

20:00.244 --> 20:02.007
The people down there,
they understand us...

20:02.079 --> 20:03.569
and they help keep us out of trouble.

20:03.647 --> 20:06.241
Just hand me the mike
and we'll pretend this never happened.

20:08.018 --> 20:10.543
Oh, my God, can we get a close-up?

20:12.189 --> 20:14.657
I am so choked up at this moment.

20:15.326 --> 20:20.263
Howard, the producer, has just asked me
if he can sign the petition live on the air.

20:20.331 --> 20:23.061
- What?
- And, of course, the answer is yes.

20:25.803 --> 20:27.168
Talk about a leader.

20:27.238 --> 20:30.264
Talk about a man
that's here to support his community.

20:33.577 --> 20:35.101
Thank you, Howard.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.846
Now for those of you that want to follow
in Howard's footsteps there's still time.

20:39.917 --> 20:42.579
Y ou can get down to
the LA Rec Center and sign a petition...

20:42.653 --> 20:45.417
and show our kids that we really care.
Thank you.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.550
Well, as I can see,
my time has run out. Trevor.

20:50.761 --> 20:52.353
No wonder they love me, man.

20:54.064 --> 20:56.225
Well, thank you for that commentary...

20:56.534 --> 20:58.729
and please remember
to put back my blazer.

21:01.038 --> 21:04.098
Hilary, thank you
for that delightful forecast.

21:04.375 --> 21:07.811
We will certainly be looking forward
to seeing more of your warm front.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.377
I mean, the warm front.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.815
Well, from all of us here
on <i>News and Action...</i>

21:18.889 --> 21:21.016
good night and Godspeed.

21:29.233 --> 21:31.064
- Hi, Will.
- Hey, what's going on, Hil?

21:31.135 --> 21:32.466
Why aren't you in bed?

21:33.771 --> 21:37.104
Uncle Phil saw the news
and he threatened to kill me in my sleep.

21:38.442 --> 21:39.875
That's nice.

21:41.111 --> 21:43.705
- With a big butcher knife.
- Good for you.

21:45.983 --> 21:48.577
- Hilary, your hair's on fire.
- Thanks.

21:50.654 --> 21:54.146
Y ou know, Will,
life doesn't get any better than this.

21:54.725 --> 21:58.821
I mean, I have a great job,
I met a great guy...

21:59.864 --> 22:02.731
and I have the thinnest ankles
of any girl I know.

22:06.270 --> 22:09.205
So, you mean you're not mad at me
for messing up your first day?

22:09.273 --> 22:10.331
Of course not.

22:10.407 --> 22:13.672
I mean, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't
have got the job in the first place.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.339
Thanks a lot, Hil. I'm proud of you.

22:17.548 --> 22:19.778
Y ou know, I'm kind of proud of myself.

22:19.850 --> 22:23.786
For the first time I feel like I know what
it means to be an independent woman.

22:26.357 --> 22:28.655
I think I'm gonna go back
to my little pool house...

22:28.726 --> 22:31.718
and toast myself
with a glass of champagne.

22:31.795 --> 22:33.763
- Good night, Hil.
- Good night, Will.

22:36.734 --> 22:40.761
- Good night, Trevor.
- Good night and Godspeed.

22:48.279 --> 22:51.112
Well, for all of us here
at <i>News and Action...</i>

22:51.181 --> 22:53.581
good night and Godspeed.

22:57.288 --> 22:58.482
Another one in the can.

22:58.555 --> 23:00.819
- Y es, you're in awe of me, aren't you?
- I am.

23:00.891 --> 23:02.620
- Y ou're the best.
- I'm a god.

23:03.494 --> 23:04.927
Y ou're very good.

23:05.095 --> 23:06.426
- <i>Exce/ente.</i>
- Y es.

23:06.497 --> 23:07.930
Cut. Pretty good.
