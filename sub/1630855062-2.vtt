WEBVTT

00:06.960 --> 00:08.960
[ticking]

00:12.090 --> 00:14.160
Amongst the many
overnight success stories

00:14.360 --> 00:15.540
in show business lore,

00:15.740 --> 00:17.910
Midge Maisel's stands out
from the rest.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.710
Her journey
from the Gaslight CafÃ©

00:19.910 --> 00:22.630
in New York's Greenwich Village
to worldwide fame and notoriety

00:22.830 --> 00:24.590
is the stuff of legend.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.260
Often press-shy,

00:26.460 --> 00:29.380
she agreed to sit down with me
and talk about her life.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.800
Hey, you look a little nervous.
Are you?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.550
Well, there's that body
in my trunk.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.470
I've been meaning to dump it,
but the day got away from me.

00:35.670 --> 00:36.890
It's been quite a ride.

00:37.090 --> 00:38.390
Grammy winner, Emmy winner,

00:38.590 --> 00:40.400
the French Order
of the Arts and Letters.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.610
Does the phrase
"living legend" apply?

00:43.810 --> 00:45.690
Geez, Mike, I'm not dead yet.

00:45.890 --> 00:48.190
Wait, am I?
Call an ambulance.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.320
Where'd this passion to perform
come from?

00:50.520 --> 00:52.870
What drives Midge Maisel?

00:53.070 --> 00:54.410
I just love what I do.

00:54.610 --> 00:56.740
I love talking to people,
present company excepted,

00:56.940 --> 00:58.160
I'm kidding.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.080
I like money,
I'm not ashamed of that.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.380
And boy, oh, boy,
do I love the sound of laughs.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.880
<i>[Mike] And what she does is</i>
<i>make people laugh.</i>

01:08.080 --> 01:09.550
<i>At age 30,</i>

01:09.750 --> 01:12.970
<i>18 consecutive sold-out nights</i>
<i>at the Copacabana.</i>

01:13.170 --> 01:15.300
<i>Numerous tours in the U.S.,</i>
<i>Canada,</i>

01:15.500 --> 01:18.180
<i>and parts of Europe</i>
<i>all sell out in minutes.</i>

01:18.380 --> 01:20.520
<i>There's the requisite</i>
<i>celebrity friendships.</i>

01:20.720 --> 01:22.100
<i>Her shows with Bob Hope</i>

01:22.300 --> 01:23.350
<i>and their many trips to Vietnam</i>

01:23.550 --> 01:25.400

01:25.600 --> 01:27.150
Midge, you look wonderful.

01:27.350 --> 01:28.780
I love that gown.
Is that a Schiaparelli?

01:28.980 --> 01:30.820
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob, but I've
forgotten where I bought it.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.490
- You mind if I look
at the label?
- [audience laughing]

01:33.690 --> 01:35.200
What does it say?

01:35.400 --> 01:37.030
"Off limits."

01:37.230 --> 01:38.910
[Midge] That's negotiable.

01:39.110 --> 01:41.120
- [cheering]
- <i>[Mike] As her audience</i>
<i>grew older,</i>

01:41.320 --> 01:43.670
<i>her inclination to shock</i>
<i>grew bolder,</i>

01:43.870 --> 01:45.290
<i>culminating in the now infamous</i>

01:45.490 --> 01:48.000
<i>- 1971 show at Carnegie Hall.</i>
<i>- [booing]</i>

01:48.200 --> 01:49.960
<i>[Midge] How does a [bleep] lady</i>
<i>like that</i>

01:50.160 --> 01:52.680
<i>have the [bleep] to [bleep]</i>
<i>show up looking like that?</i>

01:52.880 --> 01:54.970
<i>Is anyone aware of</i>
<i>the [bleep] First Amendment?</i>

01:55.170 --> 01:56.720
<i>Still applies.</i>

01:56.920 --> 01:58.770
<i>[Mike] What could have been</i>
<i>a career-ending night of infamy</i>

01:58.960 --> 02:00.180
<i>turned out to be--</i>

02:00.380 --> 02:02.690
<i>as so many things do</i>
<i>in Midge Maisel's life--</i>

02:02.890 --> 02:04.940
<i>the beginning of</i>
<i>a brand-new chapter,</i>

02:05.140 --> 02:07.860
<i>with a brand-new audience</i>
<i>of young fans</i>

02:08.060 --> 02:10.570
<i>through her audacious</i>
<i>college campus tours.</i>

02:10.770 --> 02:13.700
<i>On top of all that,</i>
<i>she raised two children,</i>

02:13.900 --> 02:17.780
<i>a son, Ethan, and a daughter,</i>
<i>Dr. Esther Maisel.</i>

02:17.980 --> 02:20.790
What was it like having
Midge Maisel as your mother?

02:20.990 --> 02:24.580
It was an incredible childhood,
filled with laughter and warmth.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.880
She's a wonderful mother.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.170
The other kids
must've been jealous.

02:28.370 --> 02:30.210
Oddly, yes.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.470
<i>[Mike] And then</i>
<i>there were the men.</i>

02:32.660 --> 02:35.090
Men. Men and Midge Maisel.

02:35.290 --> 02:36.510
So many men.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.850
You sound like my accountant.

02:39.050 --> 02:41.850
<i>Four marriages, plus several,</i>
<i>or should I say multiple,</i>

02:42.050 --> 02:43.480
<i>other relationships.</i>

02:43.680 --> 02:45.650
<i>- What gives?</i>
<i>- [Midge] I don't know.</i>

02:45.840 --> 02:47.400
Lucky in life, unlucky in love.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.690
I thought I'd marry once.
Joke's on me.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.440
<i>[Mike] And then there's</i>
<i>the relationship</i>

02:51.640 --> 02:54.200
<i>that lasted longer</i>
<i>than all the others combined.</i>

02:54.390 --> 02:56.950
<i>You were client number one</i>
<i>of the powerful</i>

02:57.150 --> 03:00.200
entertainment manager
Susie Myerson, is that right?

03:00.400 --> 03:01.830
That's right.

03:02.030 --> 03:04.830
You know her current
client list: Liza Minnelli,

03:05.030 --> 03:06.580
<i>George Carlin, Barbra Streisand.</i>

03:06.780 --> 03:09.250
<i>Just about everybody</i>
<i>in Hollywood.</i>

03:09.450 --> 03:11.590
Everybody except you.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.630
A 25-year friendship gone bust.

03:14.830 --> 03:16.840
- What happened?
- What happened, Mike,

03:17.040 --> 03:18.220
is that two people
in show business

03:18.420 --> 03:19.890
tried to have a friendship.

03:20.090 --> 03:22.390
Shall I read what she recently
said about you in <i>Variety?</i>

03:22.590 --> 03:25.980
Don't bother, I've already
had it tattooed on my [bleep].

03:26.180 --> 03:29.020
- [sighs]
- <i>[Mike] And then there were</i>
<i>her clothes.</i>

03:29.220 --> 03:31.400
And you're putting
all these up for auction?

03:31.600 --> 03:33.610
Every last button and bow.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.780
In a way,
these are my friends.

03:35.980 --> 03:40.450
My first night at the Gaslight.
Yup, the story is true.

03:40.650 --> 03:44.790
My B. Altman switchboard dress.
Those were fun times.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.410
Oh, a classic.

03:46.610 --> 03:50.630
What I wore the night of
the great tarmac dump of 1960.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.630
Night five of my first Copa run.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.210
What I wore to Woodstock--

03:54.410 --> 03:56.920
I didn't perform,
but I sure got muddy.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.010
Guest hosting <i>Johnny Carson,</i>
my cameo in <i>Mad, Mad World.</i>

04:01.210 --> 04:03.180
Oh, and this.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.680
The outfit I wore on my first
day as a writer for <i>Gordon Ford.</i>

04:06.880 --> 04:08.770
My sitting outfit.

04:08.970 --> 04:10.810
I put a lot of thought
into this one.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.610
And where do the proceeds go?

04:12.810 --> 04:14.980
The Weissman/Maisel
Children's Foundation,

04:15.180 --> 04:18.360
for childhood education,
health, hunger, housing.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.530
Children are my best teachers.

04:20.730 --> 04:24.200
Through them, I've learned
to love, to laugh, to listen.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.660
So everything I do,
I do for the children.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.460
Hit the lights, ladies.

04:28.660 --> 04:32.000
<i>[Mike] And so comedy superstar</i>
<i>Midge Maisel soldiers on,</i>

04:32.200 --> 04:35.840
<i>through success and adversity,</i>
<i>doing everything,</i>

04:36.040 --> 04:38.170
<i>in her words,</i>
<i>"For the children."</i>

04:38.370 --> 04:39.680
<i>[Midge] Eat, damn it,</i>
<i>you little bastard!</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:41.140
<i>[Rose] Miriam!</i>

04:41.330 --> 04:42.680
He has to eat to survive.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.060
- [Ethan] Not hungry!
- Deaf ears!

04:45.260 --> 04:46.600
- Your fault.
- What is?

04:46.800 --> 04:49.020
- The kids.
- We didn't force you
to have kids.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.600
No, but you created
the environment:

04:50.800 --> 04:52.610
the dolls, the books
about being a mommy,

04:52.800 --> 04:54.480
the-the quarter-scale
toy kitchen you rigged up for me

04:54.680 --> 04:56.480
with the gas broiler
and the little fridge

04:56.680 --> 04:58.320
that plugged
into a working socket.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.070
I was very proud of that
until you were electrocuted.

05:01.270 --> 05:02.870
And now I'm gonna need
some extra babysitting help.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.450
This new job is
five days a week.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.080
Miriam, tell us again
how you're gonna be a writer

05:07.280 --> 05:08.370
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

05:08.570 --> 05:09.540
I don't understand.

05:09.740 --> 05:10.710
There's nothing more to tell.

05:10.910 --> 05:11.790
He offered me a job
writing on the show,

05:11.990 --> 05:12.960
and I said yes.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.590
So, he just walks
around the city

05:14.790 --> 05:17.090
asking strangers if they want
to be writers on his show?

05:17.290 --> 05:18.460
He sounds unstable.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.300
No, I'm sure he has people
who normally do that,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.840
but this time
it came directly from him.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.220
But what's there to even write?

05:24.420 --> 05:25.930
Doesn't he just make it all up
on the spot?

05:26.130 --> 05:27.640
His whole opening monologue
is written for him.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.430
Oh, I thought
he was just naturally funny.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.350
This is shattering my illusions.

05:31.550 --> 05:33.770
Sorry, I should have broken it
to you more gently.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.610
- And you're sure it was him?
- Am I...

05:35.810 --> 05:36.690
Because I read about this woman,

05:36.890 --> 05:38.070
she was walking
down Sixth Avenue,

05:38.270 --> 05:39.820
and who does she bump into
but Winston Churchill.

05:40.020 --> 05:41.320
He tells her
he needs to get back to England

05:41.520 --> 05:43.410
because his daughter's sick,
but he lost his wallet.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.450
That's the worst.

05:44.650 --> 05:47.160
So, she gives him
everything she had, $40.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.870
Well, later on,
the same man is caught

05:49.070 --> 05:50.500
walking around Union Square
with his pants at his ankles,

05:50.700 --> 05:51.620
yelling at seagulls.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.460
So it wasn't Winston Churchill?

05:53.660 --> 05:54.790
That's my point.

05:54.990 --> 05:56.630
Maybe it wasn't Gordon Ford
who hired you.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.500
It was Gordon Ford, okay?

05:58.700 --> 05:59.800
I got hired by Gordon Ford,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.380
his pants were up,
and I accepted the job.

06:01.580 --> 06:02.630
Now let's discuss the kids.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.430
Oh, I'm happy to do all I can,
Miss Miriam.

06:04.630 --> 06:05.930
I hope you know that.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.560
It's become a great joy
in my life, watching the kids.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.060
And when I can't watch them,
well...

06:11.260 --> 06:12.730
I can. [chuckles]

06:12.930 --> 06:15.020
I love picking Ethan up
after school,

06:15.220 --> 06:16.270
and Esther loves to come along.

06:16.470 --> 06:17.900
She rides on my shoulders

06:18.100 --> 06:20.030
and tells me, "Giddyap, Janusz!"

06:20.230 --> 06:22.240
And that's when I giddyap
and go like the wind.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.740
I'm happy to stay
and play with them

06:23.940 --> 06:25.820
whenever you need me,
even at night.

06:26.020 --> 06:27.620
They're fantastic.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.410
My life was hard:
the war, the bombings.

06:31.610 --> 06:32.710
So much suffering.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.880
But, uh, spending time
with your children...

06:36.070 --> 06:38.890
They make me think about
having my own children.

06:40.190 --> 06:42.510
For the first time in my life.

06:42.710 --> 06:44.380
Well, thank you.

06:44.580 --> 06:47.440
Both of you.
I really appreciate it.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.930
- Who is that?
- Don't you know?

06:52.130 --> 06:53.600
He always has
a screwdriver with him.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.770
I thought he was a handyman.

06:54.970 --> 06:56.230
I didn't hire a handyman.

06:56.430 --> 06:58.560
He seems very familiar
with the children.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.650
And Zelda.

06:59.850 --> 07:00.860
He's been here off and on
for weeks,

07:01.060 --> 07:02.110
and none of us know who he is?

07:02.310 --> 07:05.130
Whoever he is,
sounds like he's free.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.240
[âª Bobby Rydell: "Wild One"]

[Shirley] Do not leave
the salt out!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.080
[Moishe] Since when
do we not leave the salt out?

07:16.280 --> 07:17.670
The salt is always out!

07:17.870 --> 07:20.800
[Shirley] I put it away always,
so the rats don't get in it.

07:20.990 --> 07:23.460
[Moishe] It's not sugar,
it's salt...

07:23.660 --> 07:25.880
[groaning]

07:26.080 --> 07:29.510
[arguing continues indistinctly]

07:29.710 --> 07:31.560
- ["Wild One" continues]
- [Shirley] You stopped her
on the street!

07:31.760 --> 07:33.600
[Moishe] She stopped me!
She's a yenta!

07:33.800 --> 07:35.980
She walks up and down the street
waiting to stop and schmooze!

07:36.180 --> 07:38.900
[Shirley] Moishe Maisel,
I have never said

07:39.100 --> 07:42.360
an unkind word about you
to anyone!

07:42.560 --> 07:44.400
- [Moishe groans]
- [Shirley] Tell me when I did!

07:44.600 --> 07:45.950
[Moishe] Just last year
at Disneyland!

07:46.140 --> 07:47.610
That jab about my tuchus!

07:47.810 --> 07:48.990
[Shirley] What I said
to Donald Duck that day

07:49.190 --> 07:50.490
- is between me and Donald...
- [line ringing]

07:50.690 --> 07:52.370
<i>[Archie] Buddy, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

07:52.570 --> 07:53.910
How'd you know it was me?

07:54.110 --> 07:55.620
I've been dreading the call
ever since I left you there.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.120
- <i>How do you feel?</i>
- [sighs] Like a tank hit me.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.710
You went on a bender last night,
epic in scale.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.460
- <i>Give me the headlines.</i>
- You walked in smashed.

08:04.660 --> 08:07.170
- You were hitting on girls
right in front of their dates.
- And one of them beat me up?

08:07.370 --> 08:09.550
No, then you went onstage
and insulted the band.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.640
And the band beat me up?

08:10.840 --> 08:12.350
No. Then you did
a little stand-up,

08:12.550 --> 08:14.100
and when I turned my back,
you disappeared.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.470
<i>How you got back up</i>
<i>those stairs, I don't know,</i>

08:15.670 --> 08:16.980
<i>but you were bleeding buckets.</i>

08:17.180 --> 08:18.190
I took you
to the emergency room.

08:18.390 --> 08:19.480
They patched you up
and released you,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.150
but you couldn't go home,
not alone.

08:21.350 --> 08:22.440
Your ribs are cracked,
you've got stitches.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.230
So... I brought you there.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.820
- <i>Please forgive me.</i>
- You're forgiven.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.320
[Shirley] I talked to Grumpy
and Sneezy that day, too!

08:28.520 --> 08:30.240
[Moishe] Oh, so you turned
all the Disney characters

08:30.440 --> 08:32.700
- against me, very nice!
- Actually, you may not be
forgiven just yet.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.160
Jury's out.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.540
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

08:35.740 --> 08:37.660
Nah. I got an idea.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.750
I'll talk to you later.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.000
[Shirley] In your dreams!

08:42.200 --> 08:44.380
[Moishe] You think Cinderella
wasn't looking me up and down?

08:44.580 --> 08:45.750
Oh, yes, she was!

08:45.950 --> 08:49.090
Hello! We're here!

08:49.290 --> 08:50.680
[Shirley] Who's here?
Who is here?

08:50.880 --> 08:52.090
[Moishe] Somebody's here!

08:52.290 --> 08:53.800
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.020
- Were we expecting you?
- It's the kids.

08:56.210 --> 08:57.980
When I asked how they wanted
to spend their Sunday,

08:58.170 --> 09:00.100
they said with Grandma
and Grandpa Maisel.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.600
How sweet.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.730
Come give Grandpa a big hug
there, kids. Come on.

09:03.930 --> 09:05.900
No, Grandma first.
Come to Grandma.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.900
- I had dibs. No, come on,
come on, <i>bubele.</i>
- Come on, come on.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.110
Zaydee's waiting.
Grandpa has feelings, too.

09:09.310 --> 09:10.450
[Shirley] No, you're gonna hurt
my feelings and break my heart.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.910
And his knees are hurting
quite badly.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.620
- My knees are hurting, too.
- You don't want to damage
Grandpa's knees.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.530
- Do you? I've got candy.
- My back's not so good either.

09:15.730 --> 09:17.370
- Grandpa's knees are fine.
- And football injuries.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.460
- And my heart can break, too...
- [Moishe] You don't want
to break my heart.

09:19.650 --> 09:21.290
- It's weak already.
- Oh, look, there he is.

09:21.490 --> 09:23.290
Our little patient.

09:23.490 --> 09:26.170
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:26.370 --> 09:28.880
Don't be scared,
he's gonna be fine.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.550
Your father was hit
by a very small car,

09:31.750 --> 09:34.260
but already he's so much better.
Look, he's walking.

09:34.460 --> 09:36.810
And did you grow?

09:37.010 --> 09:39.430
- These aren't my pajamas.
- [Midge] Okay.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.390
I'm fine, guys. Really.

09:41.590 --> 09:42.980
It looks worse than it is.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.150
Hey, why don't you two go
into the living room

09:45.350 --> 09:47.690
- and dig out your toys?
- I'll come with.
Let's go, kids.

09:47.890 --> 09:50.440
- Yeah, I'll be right in.
- [Ethan] I didn't want
to come here today.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.610
- [Moishe] Go get your toys...
- Ma, where are my clothes?

09:52.810 --> 09:54.990
At the dry cleaner's.
They were all dirty and bloody.

09:55.190 --> 09:57.200
They'll be back in six,
eight hours tops.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.040
But what are these?
They're not Ethan's.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.540
They're not my old ones.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.540
I keep a supply
of little boy pajamas

10:02.740 --> 10:05.040
on hand at all times,
like everyone else.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.000
- No one else does that.
- [stammers]

10:07.200 --> 10:08.500
Hey, Shirley,
better get into the living room

10:08.700 --> 10:10.210
- before the kids
run out of hugs.
- Oh, yeah.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.510
Kids, Grandma's coming.
Save me some hugs.

10:12.710 --> 10:15.510
- [Moishe speaking indistinctly]
- [groans] It's a long story.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.140
Love to hear it. Come on.

10:18.340 --> 10:19.890
Don't pull so hard.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.620
Midge,
you're pulling the stitches.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.600
Well?

10:25.800 --> 10:27.980
I got into a scuffle.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.230
That's your long story?
That wasn't even a haiku.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.650
It was at the club.

10:31.850 --> 10:33.070
You got into a fight
at the club? Where was Archie?

10:33.270 --> 10:36.170
- I talked to Mei.
- Mei? Mei did not do this.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.950
Joel? What about Mei?

10:42.150 --> 10:44.500
There is no Mei, okay?

10:44.700 --> 10:46.060
No Mei?

10:47.100 --> 10:49.960
You broke up?
But what about the baby?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.670
There's no Mei
and there's no baby.

10:51.870 --> 10:52.970
There. You happy?

10:53.160 --> 10:55.070
No baby? I...

10:56.530 --> 10:57.930
No baby.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.640
She's moving. Moved.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.520
She's already in Chicago.

11:01.710 --> 11:02.640
- It's over.
- I'm sorry.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.600
- No. [groans]
- Sorry.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.900
I was afraid something like this
would happen.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.020
- Like what?
- I...

11:09.220 --> 11:10.730
- She wasn't ready.
- How do you know?

11:10.930 --> 11:12.860
I just had a feeling
after we talked at the hospital.

11:13.060 --> 11:15.320
- At the hospital?
- When we discussed the kids
and how it would work...

11:15.520 --> 11:17.820
- You mean with Pop?
- ...she just didn't seem to be
on the same page as you.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.830
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

11:20.020 --> 11:21.540
And you didn't think to maybe
give me a heads-up

11:21.730 --> 11:23.620
that my whole fucking life was
about to come crashing down?

11:23.820 --> 11:26.170
It was just a feeling I had,
an intuition.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.960
You never should have spoken
to her in the first place.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.750
- Joel...
- This is what could've
pushed her over the edge.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.420
Made her do what she did.

11:31.620 --> 11:34.470
- Hey, that's not fair.
She chose.
- With your help!

11:34.660 --> 11:35.840
I'm gonna wait
till you get better to smack you

11:36.040 --> 11:37.320
because now won't be fun.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.600
I did nothing to push Mei away.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.770
I've got eight hours
till my clothes are back.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.410
I'm gonna go lie down.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.940
[groans softly]

11:51.140 --> 11:54.040
- I could swing
by your place and...
- I'm good.

11:56.630 --> 11:59.370
[gasps]

11:59.560 --> 12:03.290
- [phone ringing]
- Are you fucking kidding me?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.830
Okay, so,
I thought I'd picked out

12:05.030 --> 12:06.830
the perfect first day outfit
for <i>Gordon Ford.</i>

12:07.030 --> 12:08.670
I mean, I spent hours
thinking about it,

12:08.870 --> 12:10.420
sorting through multiple
color combinations,

12:10.620 --> 12:12.500
but around 5:00 this morning,
something struck me.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.800
Was it a blunt object?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.260
- What?
- Go on.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.220
This isn't a standing job.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.590
It's a sitting job.

12:18.790 --> 12:21.350
Huh. Explain.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.010
B. Altman,
I stood at the counter.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.350
That was a standing job.

12:24.550 --> 12:25.930
Doing stand-up comedy,
that's a standing job.

12:26.130 --> 12:27.560
I know how to dress for that,
but this,

12:27.760 --> 12:30.150
working at <i>Gordon Ford,</i>
this is a sitting job,

12:30.350 --> 12:32.860
predominantly,
so the skirt can't be straight.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.650
I mean, it can be straight
if there's a slit in it,

12:34.850 --> 12:36.280
but not a side slit, no.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.490
If I shift in my seat,
even a little,

12:37.690 --> 12:38.950
they'll get an eyeful.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.660
A back slit is okay, like a...

12:40.860 --> 12:42.320
like a tasteful vent extension,

12:42.520 --> 12:44.120
but again, that's more
for ease of walking.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.700
So that brings us back to flare.
It needs to flare.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.500
And it needs to flare
in a way that will accommodate

12:48.700 --> 12:50.460
a variety of
different sitting positions.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.960
Interesting.
Really interesting.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.170
- And that's why you called?
- Yep.

12:54.370 --> 12:58.170
So, to review, you called me at
four-fucking-fifty-fucking-six

12:58.370 --> 12:59.930
in the morning,
after hours of thought

13:00.120 --> 13:02.050
and excessive consideration
about color combinations,

13:02.250 --> 13:03.720
because you suddenly realized

13:03.920 --> 13:05.390
that this job
would involve sitting?

13:05.590 --> 13:07.020
- Yeah.
- But before that,

13:07.220 --> 13:08.270
you thought that
the job was to stand

13:08.470 --> 13:10.020
in front of Gordon Ford
for eight straight hours

13:10.220 --> 13:12.560
and pitch jokes?
That is just fucking dumb.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.480
I don't know what the job is.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.980
New rule, for you

13:16.180 --> 13:18.360
and the entire demented moronic
fucking Weissman clan,

13:18.560 --> 13:21.950
no one, and I mean no one, is
allowed to ring my goddamn phone

13:22.150 --> 13:24.160
before 10:30 in the morning
for any reason.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.030
Here's a fresh cup, Miss Susie.

13:26.230 --> 13:27.450
Unless It's Zelda.

13:27.650 --> 13:29.080
'Cause I know if Zelda calls me,

13:29.280 --> 13:30.750
she will make up for it
with something delicious.

13:30.950 --> 13:32.500
- [Zelda] Thank you, Miss Susie.
- Mm-hmm.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.000
Psst.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.380
[whispers] I have some major
household dish for you.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.170
Is it dumb? Because really,
if it's dumb,

13:38.370 --> 13:39.800
I am throwing you
out that goddamn window.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.260
Zelda has a boyfriend.

13:41.460 --> 13:42.970
A new one?
What happened to Janusz?

13:43.170 --> 13:45.100
No, it is Janusz.
How do you know about Janusz?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.890
She's been with him
for, like, four months.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.310
I run into them on the nights
they hit the Village.

13:48.510 --> 13:49.560
He's an excellent dancer.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.770
How are you just
finding out about this?

13:51.970 --> 13:54.060
- He just changed the hardware
in the bathroom.
- That was him?

13:54.260 --> 13:55.650
You didn't notice
a guy who looks like Mr. Clean

13:55.850 --> 13:57.820
who's got a boner for Zelda
hanging out in your apartment?

13:58.020 --> 13:59.530
Guess I'm not as observant
as I should be.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.030
And you're
an observational comic.

14:01.230 --> 14:02.860
I mean, really, there's
something missing in you.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.370
Oh, shoot.
Drinks after work.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.330
Not only do I need
an outfit for sitting at work,

14:07.530 --> 14:09.620
but it has to be appropriate
for drinks with the gang.

14:09.820 --> 14:11.870
Okay. This is not
a cocktail party.

14:12.070 --> 14:14.120
It's a job. Here.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.710
This...

14:15.910 --> 14:18.400
with this and this.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.170
- And this.
- Wow. That's great.

14:22.370 --> 14:23.590
And you can sit in it
and everything?

14:23.790 --> 14:25.180
I want to be sure
that you can sit in it.

14:25.380 --> 14:26.850
- It's got enough flare?
- It's perfect.

14:27.050 --> 14:28.810
- Going back to bed.
- Thank you, Susie.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.310
Fuck you, Midge.

14:30.510 --> 14:32.450
âª âª

14:37.410 --> 14:39.420
[indistinct chatter]

14:46.210 --> 14:48.240
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

14:48.440 --> 14:50.390
[bell rings]

14:53.260 --> 14:55.270
âª âª

15:04.770 --> 15:07.280
[dialogue inaudible]

15:14.280 --> 15:15.850
- No!
- Who is she talking to?

15:16.050 --> 15:17.730
Sorry, I'm-I'm talking to him.

15:17.930 --> 15:20.080
[man] Subway weirdo.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.280
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

15:25.480 --> 15:27.300
[bell rings]

15:29.050 --> 15:30.990
Midge!

15:31.190 --> 15:33.660
I said no.
I don't want to talk to you.

15:33.860 --> 15:37.540
Please wait. I...
I never got a chance to explain.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.080
Tell it to
your espresso machine.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.560
Oh, Midge, come on.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.340
Excuse me, excuse me.
Bad man behind me.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.430
I have no phone number for you,
no address.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.640
- I had no way to contact you.
- Good.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.180
I didn't want you to contact me.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.810
Chanel? Really nice.

15:54.010 --> 15:54.890
I went to the park
every morning for weeks.

15:55.090 --> 15:56.180
You never showed.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.440
That's because I never went
back to the park.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.230
I brought flowers every day
to apologize.

16:01.430 --> 16:02.610
I hope you brought 'em home
to the wife.

16:02.810 --> 16:04.250
It's a shame to waste flowers.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.570
- Ah, that is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

16:07.770 --> 16:10.320
Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.510
Two minutes.
That's all I ask. Look.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.470
- Two minutes!
- [bell rings]

16:20.850 --> 16:24.250
Okay, that was fun and all,
but I just need to tell you...

16:24.450 --> 16:27.050
[indistinct chatter]

16:27.250 --> 16:29.860
[sighs] Unbelievable.

16:31.110 --> 16:33.350
Excuse me. Coming through.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.560
- Make a hole, damn it.
- Rude!

16:35.760 --> 16:36.890
Me?

16:37.090 --> 16:38.560
You're the ones lined up
like the offensive line

16:38.760 --> 16:41.410
- of the Princeton Tigers.
- [woman gasps]

16:43.870 --> 16:46.230
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

16:46.430 --> 16:47.990
I'd never done that, I swear.

16:48.190 --> 16:49.820
Done what? Stalked a woman
on the subway?

16:50.020 --> 16:51.700
Brought a woman
back to my place.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.240
- You mean
you and your wife's place.
- It's not what you think.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.870
I'm sorry,
but we talked and talked,

16:56.070 --> 16:57.620
and you never said
you were married.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.500
- I'm not!
- So who was that, your sister?

16:59.700 --> 17:01.290
Was your sister unhappy you were
sleeping with another woman?

17:01.490 --> 17:03.420
- 'Cause that's a problem, too.
- You know, I'd really rather

17:03.620 --> 17:05.300
that all of New York
not hear about this.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.800
You're the one who started it.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.420
Why are you going uptown now?

17:08.620 --> 17:09.720
You were going downtown.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.090
This is downtown.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.510
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

17:12.710 --> 17:13.680
Damn it.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.740
[trains screeching, whirring]

17:20.700 --> 17:23.480
Damn it. Midge? You here?

17:23.680 --> 17:25.520
- Midge?
- Excuse me. Is there a problem?

17:25.720 --> 17:27.480
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a friend of mine.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.280
Officer, that's the man who
assaulted me on the staircase.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.610
- Assaulted you? When?
- I didn't assault anyone.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.700
He cursed at us
and called us offensive.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.430
- What the heck?
- They were blocking
the staircase.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.430
- [bell rings]
- [busy chatter]

17:42.810 --> 17:44.810
- [whistle blows in distance]
- [horns honking]

17:46.810 --> 17:48.510
- Two minutes.
- Jesus H. Christ.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.090
Then you never have to see me
again, I promise.

17:51.290 --> 17:54.760
Tell him it's okay.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.820
It's okay.

17:58.530 --> 18:00.310
I messed up really bad.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.020
I put you in an awful situation.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.650
Awful? It was more than awful.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.520
It was every synonym for awful,
you choose.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.860
I'll work on one tonight.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.610
- So, that was my wife.
- And not your sister.

18:11.810 --> 18:13.280
But we were separated
and living apart.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.530
That was my place.
She got our old house.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.530
So, why'd she waltz in
like that?

18:17.730 --> 18:18.870
To drop off the dog,

18:19.070 --> 18:21.580
which she's supposed to do
with prior notice.

18:21.780 --> 18:24.500
- And now
we're getting divorced.
- You and the dog?

18:24.700 --> 18:26.500
The marriage was over
long before I met you.

18:26.700 --> 18:30.590
Look, Midge, meeting you,
the talks we had,

18:30.790 --> 18:32.470
it was a lifesaver for me.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.890
But I'm not here
to get you to reconsider.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.950
I just want to apologize.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.020
- How is the dog?
- She took the dog.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.350
- What?
- And changed his name.

18:44.550 --> 18:46.230
That's rotten.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.650
Did I ruin Riverside Park
for you? Tell me I didn't.

18:48.850 --> 18:51.440
Just temporarily.
I'm back in it now.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.650
Good, 'cause it's a great park.

18:53.850 --> 18:55.450
It is.

18:55.650 --> 18:58.950
Well, maybe we'll run into each
other there again, sometime.

18:59.150 --> 19:00.580
Maybe.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.410
Maybe's good.

19:02.610 --> 19:04.140
I'll take maybe.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.330
Bye, Midge.

19:06.530 --> 19:08.390
Goodbye, Sylvio.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.420
- I'm rooting for you, son.
- [chuckles]

19:12.620 --> 19:14.340

19:49.990 --> 19:51.550
And you say Gordon hired you?

19:51.740 --> 19:53.630
Gordon doesn't hire
people personally.

19:53.830 --> 19:56.340
I know it's unusual,
but he came to my strip club,

19:56.540 --> 19:57.720
uh, my club,

19:57.920 --> 20:00.010
- where I perform.
- Oh, I get it.

20:00.210 --> 20:02.510
No, you don't.
I'm a stand-up. A comedian.

20:02.710 --> 20:04.180
So, you're here
to be on the show?

20:04.380 --> 20:05.980
You have to be booked
to be on the show.

20:06.180 --> 20:07.560
You can't just walk in
off the street

20:07.760 --> 20:08.940
and ask to be booked
on the show.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.610
I didn't just walk in
off the street. Oh, wait.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.110
He knows me. Mike! Mike! Mike!

20:14.310 --> 20:16.280
Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!

20:16.480 --> 20:18.380
Mike! Mike! Midge Maisel.

20:19.710 --> 20:20.660
Let her in.

20:20.860 --> 20:22.510
[sighs]

20:24.800 --> 20:27.620
You and I haven't
officially met.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.580
Look, Mike,

20:29.780 --> 20:31.330
I know you and Susie
got off to a rocky start.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.960
Rocky start. [chuckles]
You're... very funny.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.920
But now I'm here, and don't you
think it would be best to...

20:36.120 --> 20:37.090
Do you know it has no smell?

20:37.290 --> 20:38.930
What? What doesn't?

20:39.130 --> 20:40.090
My tree.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.550
Because it's
a piece of shit tree

20:41.750 --> 20:42.970
that I grabbed
in haste to get away

20:43.170 --> 20:45.600
from your little troll
of a manager. My apartment has

20:45.800 --> 20:47.390
no Christmassy smell

20:47.590 --> 20:48.850
'cause the goddamn tree

20:49.050 --> 20:51.060
is a piece of shit,
lifeless tree.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.860
You are gonna learn to like me.

20:53.060 --> 20:55.610
Boy, you two, peas in a pod.

20:55.810 --> 20:57.570
It may take a month,
two months tops.

20:57.770 --> 20:59.030
Hell, give me six months,

20:59.230 --> 21:00.570
and you and I are bowling
and drinking beer.

21:00.770 --> 21:02.780
Look, I got to go, but would you
deliver a message to Susie?

21:02.980 --> 21:03.880
Sure.

21:06.340 --> 21:07.620
I will pass it on.

21:07.820 --> 21:10.060
You're late, by the way.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.840
Those are the writers?
Is that...

21:14.040 --> 21:15.050
Is that where
I'm supposed to go?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.610
- That's the writers' room. Go.
- Thanks.

21:19.860 --> 21:22.090
- Oop.
- [Mel] You don't think
he could direct

21:22.290 --> 21:24.300
- a drama, Alvin?
- [Alvin] Mel was
on Caesar with me.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.600
I have no problem with
Mel Brooks. I like Mel Brooks.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.100
Mel Brooks is funny.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.560
- But?
- Here it comes.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.190
- He likes air.
- [others] Oh!

21:31.390 --> 21:33.060
[Alvin] Oh, does he like air.

21:33.260 --> 21:35.940
He comes in a room like a
Hoover, and he sucks it all up.

21:36.140 --> 21:38.650
Ask Simon. Ask Gelbart.
Hell, ask Sid.

21:38.850 --> 21:41.110
The green-eyed monster doth
mock the meat it feeds on.

21:41.310 --> 21:43.030
Geez, Cess, Shakespeare
before noon?

21:43.230 --> 21:44.530
My only request, dear Alvin,

21:44.730 --> 21:46.740
please stop taking your hatred
for Mel Brooks

21:46.940 --> 21:48.830
out on me just because
we share a name.

21:49.030 --> 21:51.100
- I don't hate Mel Brooks.
- Me neither.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.250
Hi.

21:54.450 --> 21:55.340
Am I in the right place?

21:55.530 --> 21:56.380
- No.
- Don't think so.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.550
This is the writers' room,
right?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.010
- Pretty much.
- Who's asking?
- We're writers in a room.

21:59.210 --> 22:00.760
Well, I'm your new writer.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.130
Alvin?

22:02.330 --> 22:03.930
George mentioned some girl
was starting with us.

22:04.130 --> 22:04.930
He didn't say when.

22:05.130 --> 22:06.260
Well, I'm some girl,

22:06.460 --> 22:07.720
and today is the day.
Who's George?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.890
- You'll know him
when you see him.
- Mothballs.

22:10.090 --> 22:11.770
- Boat shoes.
- I have boat shoes.

22:11.970 --> 22:13.600
I wouldn't have minded being
consulted about a new hire,

22:13.800 --> 22:16.480
but I'm just the head writer,
so what do I know? Milly?

22:16.680 --> 22:18.020
- Midge.
- Midge?

22:18.220 --> 22:20.030
Never trust people whose names
don't rhyme with anything.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.400
Smidge. Bridge. Fridge.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.360
Shit.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.030
That's Ralph, Mel, Adam, Cecil,

22:25.230 --> 22:26.660
- and I'm Alvin. Sit.
- [Midge] Great.

22:26.860 --> 22:28.410
Got my sitting outfit on.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.450
- [Mel] Your what?
- It's a flared skirt

22:30.650 --> 22:31.750
for sitting instead of standing.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.420
I mean, you can stand in it,
but it looks good

22:33.610 --> 22:34.500
when you're sitting, too.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.380
Got that versatility,
like pants.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.040
[Alvin] So, Gordon's
in a foul mood.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.460
- Again?
- What in that man's
charmed life is so terrible?

22:40.660 --> 22:41.590
- [Alvin] He's given up smoking.
- Oh, Jesus.

22:41.790 --> 22:42.760
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, for God's sake.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.130
[Alvin] And he doesn't want
anyone else

22:44.330 --> 22:45.590
smoking in the office.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.550
If he gets divorced, does
everyone else have to, too?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.560
[Mel] Can I finish
this one at least? No?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.730
Guess cancer will have to wait.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.310
[Cecil] First they came
for the cigarettes,

22:53.510 --> 22:54.640
and I did not speak out.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.060
So, let's get going here, boys.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.190
- Give me a good mix, 20 in one.
- Uh...

22:58.390 --> 22:59.980
- What... Wait, where...
- [overlapping chatter]

23:00.180 --> 23:02.070
- Um, Alvin, what's 20 in one?
- [phone rings]

23:02.270 --> 23:03.900
Yeah?

23:04.100 --> 23:05.200
Yeah, I know
Bernstein's tonight.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.950
I read the memo.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.530
No, I'm not gonna hand him
a bunch of dumb Maestro jokes.

23:09.730 --> 23:12.290
Come on, Alex. Just give him
a goddamn cigarette.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.850
- [indistinct chatter]
- [phone rings]

23:16.890 --> 23:18.630
Hi. Hey.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.670
Any idea what 20 in one is?

23:20.870 --> 23:23.130
- Nope.
- [phone rings]

23:23.330 --> 23:25.090
<i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

23:25.290 --> 23:27.140
Yes, he's quit smoking.

23:27.330 --> 23:28.640
Well, we're spreading
the word now,

23:28.840 --> 23:30.850
we weren't keeping it from you.

23:31.050 --> 23:33.980
Yes, we all have
to quit smoking.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.940
Oh, hi, Midge.
Susie, it's Midge.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.770
She sounds a little weird.

23:38.970 --> 23:40.070
How's it going, champ?

23:40.260 --> 23:42.940
Panic. I'm in a panic. Oh, boy.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.860
- Take a deep breath.
- I'm hyperventilating.

23:45.060 --> 23:46.530
<i>[Dinah] [over phone] Stick</i>
<i>your head between your legs.</i>

23:46.730 --> 23:47.950
Who is that? Dinah?

23:48.150 --> 23:49.910
- Or have a cigarette.
- [groans]

23:50.110 --> 23:51.910
- <i>[Susie] What is wrong</i>
<i>with you?</i>
- Why didn't you tell me

23:52.110 --> 23:52.910
<i>about 20 in one?</i>

23:53.110 --> 23:54.620
I don't know. What is 20 in one?

23:54.820 --> 23:56.620
The head writer just sent us
off to do 20 in one.

23:56.820 --> 23:59.790
It's 20 jokes in one hour,
and that was eight minutes ago,

23:59.990 --> 24:03.000
so I've got... I'm so freaked
out, I can't even do the math.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.920
You've got 52 minutes
to write 20 jokes.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.050
Quick math here, that's a joke
every 2.6 minutes. Ha.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.800
- <i>Finally using math.</i>
- Not helping.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.430
And I'm assuming they need to be
broadcast quality jokes.

24:11.630 --> 24:12.430
Each one a winner.

24:12.630 --> 24:14.270
Dinah, why are you on the phone?

24:14.470 --> 24:15.600
I got her on
to listen and learn.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.980
It's how all
the big agencies do it.

24:17.180 --> 24:19.020
You're now down to a joke
every 2.5 minutes.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.480
You're not supposed
to talk, Dinah.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.190
I don't toss jokes off
like that.

24:22.390 --> 24:24.530
They take time. I mold them,

24:24.730 --> 24:26.070
massage them,
and now I'm just blanking,

24:26.270 --> 24:27.400
and the clock is ticking.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.610
Well, let's prime the pump here,
get the juices flowing.

24:29.810 --> 24:32.910
How about this? Uh, Washington
Square Park isn't square,

24:33.110 --> 24:34.990
it's a rectangle, so they
should change the name

24:35.190 --> 24:36.660
to Washington Rectangle Park.

24:36.860 --> 24:38.540
- Oh, that's cute.
- That's a terrible joke.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.750
Yeah, well I'm not the
fucking joke writer. You are.

24:40.950 --> 24:42.380
No, I'm not. I told you that.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.920
Well, you've got the job,
so fake it till you make it.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.090
I should check my notebook.
See if anything inspires me.

24:48.290 --> 24:50.470
All that matters is that
Gordon Ford thinks you're funny.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.680
How's it going with him?
You two bonding?

24:52.880 --> 24:54.350
I haven't seen him.
I think he's in a different part

24:54.550 --> 24:56.390
of the building. And was I
supposed to have an office?

24:56.590 --> 24:57.770
<i>Because I don't seem</i>
<i>to have an office.</i>

24:57.970 --> 24:58.770
I didn't think about that.

24:58.970 --> 25:00.060
Barely even have a chair,

25:00.260 --> 25:01.650
and I-I have no idea
where the ladies' room is,

25:01.850 --> 25:03.150
and everyone seems
to be talking in code,

25:03.350 --> 25:05.440
and Mike Carr wanted me
to pass this on to you.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.820

25:07.020 --> 25:08.860

Got to start thinking...
writing. Goodbye.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.540
I really loved him.

25:17.740 --> 25:18.830
He's the one I miss.

25:19.030 --> 25:20.710
How did your second husband die?

25:20.910 --> 25:22.710
Well, it was the darndest thing.

25:22.910 --> 25:24.460
It was winter, and he was
walking down the street

25:24.660 --> 25:26.460
- when he slipped on ice.
- Oh, my God.

25:26.660 --> 25:29.260
It gets worse.
The street was on a hill,

25:29.460 --> 25:31.050
and he slid all the way down
where these men

25:31.250 --> 25:32.930
- were running a wood chipper.
- Oh, my God.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.720
It gets worse.
Rose, where are you going?

25:35.920 --> 25:38.310
[overlapping chatter]

25:38.510 --> 25:40.810
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

25:41.010 --> 25:42.650
- What happened?
- A fire happened, lady.

25:42.850 --> 25:43.690
Now, please, back away.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.650
- But how?
- Could be electrical,

25:45.850 --> 25:46.770
could be arson,
we don't know yet.

25:46.970 --> 25:47.980
Arson...

25:48.180 --> 25:49.990
This is too much.

25:50.190 --> 25:51.650
This is too damn much.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.740
What is, Rose?
What's too damn much?

25:53.940 --> 25:56.220

just 59 minutes.

26:12.670 --> 26:14.890
Shut up. All right, Mel,
you look smug

26:15.090 --> 26:17.260

Oh, she doesn't know

31:34.760 --> 31:36.040
So, what's the deal?

31:36.240 --> 31:38.040
He wants them shorter
and not topical.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.040
Now he tells us.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.420
[Adam] Wasted the whole morning.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.310
[Alvin] Until the bell, guys.
20 in one.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.430
- [Mel] I need coffee.
- [Alvin] Trudy, coffee run.
- [sighs]

31:46.630 --> 31:49.760
Everything shut down during the
war. The arts were decimated.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.140
Were you there the whole time?

31:51.340 --> 31:52.970
I was in London
during the Blitz.

31:53.170 --> 31:54.350
I saw the German Luftwaffe

31:54.550 --> 31:55.810
flying through the air.

31:56.010 --> 31:57.980
My grandmother's house
in Mayfair was bombed.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.980
- My God.
- She lived,

32:00.180 --> 32:01.110
but we thought
the world had ended.

32:01.310 --> 32:02.400
[sighs]

32:02.600 --> 32:04.990
Then, in '44, Larry did
<i>Richard the Third.</i>

32:05.190 --> 32:06.360
- Larry?
- Olivier.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.860
- Ah.
- I sat in the front row,

32:08.060 --> 32:11.700
and, I don't know, my faith
in mankind was restored.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.660
- I knew that we
could beat Hitler.
- That's wonderful.

32:13.860 --> 32:14.830
Then I slept with Larry.

32:15.030 --> 32:16.660
That's better than
sleeping with Hitler.

32:16.860 --> 32:19.250
I know it sounds silly, but that
helped restore my faith, too.

32:19.450 --> 32:21.460
- Mm.
- Our <i>Ã®le flottante,</i>

32:21.660 --> 32:23.630

- Darling boy, thank you.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.720

32:33.670 --> 32:36.430
He's not for everybody,
but I think he's a mad genius,

32:36.630 --> 32:39.520
and he's only 30,
such a young, virile age.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.110
The Nobel is in his future.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.980
- I'll be there.
- Music to my ears.

32:43.180 --> 32:45.690
Oh, dear, it's so much later
than I thought.

32:45.890 --> 32:48.490
Ah, this is on the <i>Voice.</i>

32:48.690 --> 32:50.280
So kind.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.160
I should bring my wife here.
She'd love this place.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.620
She's such a Francophile.

32:54.820 --> 32:56.370
- My husband is French.
- Ah.

32:56.570 --> 32:59.420
They should meet. Now,
I'm so sorry, I have to dash.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.380
More <i>Ã®le flottante pour moi.</i>

33:01.580 --> 33:05.050
[laughs] If I had known I'd be
dining with such a charming man,

33:05.250 --> 33:06.710
I'd have scheduled time
to linger.

33:06.910 --> 33:09.480
Next time I won't make
that mistake.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.760
This...

33:14.960 --> 33:16.430
this wallet

33:16.630 --> 33:18.100
is so old.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.480
I really need

33:19.680 --> 33:20.980
change it out.

33:21.180 --> 33:23.060
I'm trying to

33:23.260 --> 33:26.730
remember how old it is.
Maybe seven, eight years.

33:26.930 --> 33:29.700
You don't think to change
your wallet till you get one

33:29.900 --> 33:32.030
as a gift, but if you
don't get one as a gift,

33:32.230 --> 33:33.950
you never change your wallet.

33:34.150 --> 33:36.370
- How are you liking it?
- Liking what?

33:36.570 --> 33:37.910
The, uh, dessert?

33:38.110 --> 33:40.160
Ah, it's... it's...

33:40.360 --> 33:42.330
ve-ve-very-very good, very
fine. Here.

33:42.530 --> 33:44.340
- Ah. <i>Merci.</i>
- Here.

33:44.530 --> 33:45.920
You are silly.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.670
At times, yes,
but at other times

33:48.870 --> 33:51.630
I'm more... dramatic,

33:51.830 --> 33:54.890
like Olivier, or not Olivier,
I'm nothing like Olivier.

33:55.090 --> 33:56.720
I'm more like...

33:56.920 --> 33:58.930
Buster Keaton,

33:59.130 --> 34:01.140
just a big, old,

34:01.340 --> 34:04.230
sad, floppy clown boy.

34:04.430 --> 34:06.520
Sweet.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.170
Till next time.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.550
[bell rings]

34:16.180 --> 34:18.120
They've been gone a long time.
That's a good sign, right?

34:18.320 --> 34:19.700
Not necessarily. Last Tuesday?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.290
We almost didn't make it to air.

34:21.490 --> 34:23.120
- Should I get my typewriter?
- Do not get your typewriter.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.130
- What are we waiting for?
- The verdict from rehearsal.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.710
[Mel] Here they come.
Duck and cover.

34:26.910 --> 34:28.710
- Ah, hell.
- Goddamn it, Teddy.

34:28.910 --> 34:30.840
- I love you guys, too.
- What happened?

34:31.040 --> 34:33.090
He's the cue card guy. Means
the monologue's not locked.

34:33.290 --> 34:35.010
- Should I get my typewriter?
- Do not get your typewriter.

34:35.210 --> 34:36.430
- What's left?
- Zip.

34:36.630 --> 34:38.180
- He threw the entire thing out.
- [Adam] Holy shit.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.520
It's one hour to show.

34:39.710 --> 34:40.730
Should've gotten my typewriter.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.930
Definitely.

34:42.130 --> 34:43.310
I know it's disappointing, gang,

34:43.510 --> 34:45.020
but ours is not to reason why,

34:45.220 --> 34:47.230
ours is but to write
new jokes or die.

34:47.430 --> 34:51.240
Now, I've got to go say hello
to Angie Dickinson.

34:51.430 --> 34:53.820
Poor me. [laughs]

34:54.020 --> 34:57.030
Okay, guys, lightning round.
Old, new, whatever you got.

34:57.230 --> 34:58.580
Oh, shit.

34:58.780 --> 34:59.950
- Trudy, hustle.
- [Trudy] I'm already in.

35:00.150 --> 35:01.500
Gordon wants 'em topical.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.040
You said before
he wanted 'em not topical.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.710
Gordon is large, he contains
multitudes. Ralphy?

35:05.910 --> 35:07.840
Uh, topical, topical...

35:08.030 --> 35:10.420
Uh, "Emily Post died,
so now no one knows

35:10.620 --> 35:12.300
the proper etiquette
to send their condolences."

35:12.500 --> 35:13.880
- [laughter]
- [Alvin] Not bad.
Get it down. Cess?

35:14.080 --> 35:16.260
Uh, "I went to the premiere
of a French film the other day.

35:16.460 --> 35:18.640
It's called
<i>Le Hau-hau-hau-hau-hauuu."</i>

35:18.840 --> 35:20.810
- [laughter]
- "Translates roughly
into English as

35:21.010 --> 35:22.390
<i>Le Hau-hau-hau-hau-hauuu."</i>

35:22.590 --> 35:24.600
Not bad. We should follow
it up with something. Mel?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.900
<i>"Ben-Hur,</i> if he's a him,
what's with the Hur?"

35:27.100 --> 35:28.900
- [Alvin] Pass. Adam?
- [Adam] Uh, "Some sad news,

35:29.100 --> 35:31.320
Clark Gable passed away.
He's survived by his wife,

35:31.520 --> 35:32.610
his children and his mustache."

35:32.810 --> 35:34.650
He loved Gable.
Put it in. Who else?

35:34.850 --> 35:38.240
Uh, well, I worked on some
new stuff during rehearsal.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.030
- You what?
- [groans] Jesus.

35:40.230 --> 35:41.910
- I worked on some new stuff.
- [Mel] She jinxed it.

35:42.110 --> 35:43.540
- You jinxed it.
- Jinxed what?

35:43.740 --> 35:45.410
We never work on new stuff
during rehearsal,

35:45.610 --> 35:47.370
- ever.
- What? Why?

35:47.570 --> 35:49.710
It guarantees that Gordon's
gonna throw everything out.

35:49.910 --> 35:52.090
I'm sorry, Gordon somehow knew
I was sitting in a bathroom

35:52.290 --> 35:53.550
stall jotting down jokes?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.470
That's why he threw out
the script? Is he omniscient?

35:55.670 --> 35:56.760
If anyone is...

35:56.960 --> 35:59.140
Let the girl pitch.
Go on, Midge.

35:59.340 --> 36:00.600
Thank you, Alvin.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.270
<i>"The Unsinkable Molly Brown</i>

36:03.470 --> 36:04.480
is a new show on Broadway.

36:04.670 --> 36:05.600
I heard that the ushers
are seating

36:05.800 --> 36:07.440
women and children first."

36:07.640 --> 36:09.480
She was on the <i>Titanic.</i>

36:09.680 --> 36:11.070
He nixed a <i>Molly Brown</i> joke
last week.

36:11.260 --> 36:12.270
- Mine.
- [Alvin] Got another?

36:12.470 --> 36:14.150
Yeah, um...

36:14.350 --> 36:17.360
"There's gonna be a baby in
the White House, little JFK Jr.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.610
It'll be a clean transition.

36:18.810 --> 36:19.780
White House staff
already learned

36:19.980 --> 36:21.620
how to change diapers
with Eisenhower."

36:21.820 --> 36:23.240
"A" for effort. Cess?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.410
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- Yeah?

36:25.610 --> 36:27.330
I'm sorry,
but that last one was funny.

36:27.530 --> 36:29.290
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

36:29.490 --> 36:31.380
- No one laughed.
- I think the audience would,

36:31.580 --> 36:32.630
and it's topical,
he wants topical.

36:32.830 --> 36:33.880
A joke is not funny

36:34.080 --> 36:35.170
just because you say it's funny.

36:35.370 --> 36:37.170
No, it's not funny
because I say it's funny.

36:37.370 --> 36:38.550
It's funny because it's funny.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.470
- And you know funny?
- Yeah, I know funny.

36:40.670 --> 36:42.180
Great. Alvin,
put my <i>Ben-Hur</i> joke in

36:42.380 --> 36:43.930
because I know funny,
and I think it's funny.

36:44.130 --> 36:45.600
- Mel...
- Your <i>Ben-Hur</i> joke
was not funny.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.060
- Oh, really?
- Or topical or fresh.

36:48.260 --> 36:50.860
Wasn't even funny when I heard
Jack Paar do it two weeks ago.

36:51.050 --> 36:52.230
- [others] Oh!
- Alvin.

36:52.430 --> 36:54.570
We have no time for this.
Sorry. Cess, go.

36:54.770 --> 36:56.070
Okay, uh...

36:56.270 --> 36:57.320
"There's a commercial
for dishwashing soap.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.240
- Any of you see it?"
- I bet she did.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.780
[others laugh and groan]

37:00.980 --> 37:03.240
[woman] Hi, yes,
he's expecting your call.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.540
Abe, how was your meeting?
[sneezes]

37:05.740 --> 37:07.410
Cover your goddamn
mouth, Terrence.

37:07.610 --> 37:09.120
- [Terrence] That was harsh.
- Gabe, Gabe.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.540
- Abe, you okay?
- I've got a question,

37:11.740 --> 37:13.840
and be honest because

37:14.040 --> 37:16.050
I don't know all the intricacies

37:16.250 --> 37:17.760
of New York theater customs...

37:17.960 --> 37:19.590
Okay.

37:19.790 --> 37:22.930
Is this sexual?

37:23.130 --> 37:24.760
So many thoughts

37:24.960 --> 37:26.220
running through my mind
right now, Abe.

37:26.420 --> 37:28.390
- You're wondering
why I'm asking.
- Very much.

37:28.590 --> 37:30.480
At my lunch with Penelope,

37:30.680 --> 37:32.350
it was all going so smoothly.

37:32.550 --> 37:35.860
We talked about theater
and criticism and the war.

37:36.060 --> 37:39.280
Then she did this
with her hand,

37:39.480 --> 37:41.070
- and it felt...
- Sexual?

37:41.270 --> 37:42.620
- Yes.
- That's because it is.

37:42.810 --> 37:44.910
I knew it.

37:45.110 --> 37:47.080
So, it was a sexualized gesture.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.620
One of the oldest.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.750
- You can remove your hand now.
- [sighs]

37:51.950 --> 37:53.330
I don't get it.

37:53.530 --> 37:55.040
I don't get it. It was lunch.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.420
[Gabe] So?

37:56.620 --> 37:59.300
Nothing sexual happens
before 7:00 in the evening,

37:59.500 --> 38:01.050
6:30 at the earliest.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.760
Never at 1:42 in the afternoon
on a Monday.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.010
I am learning a lot
about you today.

38:07.210 --> 38:09.600
I've been racking my brain,
trying to think if I said

38:09.800 --> 38:12.140
something that gave her
the wrong impression.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.900
Was I too kind
to <i>A Pudding for Nigel?</i>

38:15.100 --> 38:16.020
Is that all it takes?

38:16.220 --> 38:17.150
That, and a hearty Bordeaux.

38:17.350 --> 38:18.230
How did you know we had wine?

38:18.430 --> 38:19.690
Because you smell like wine.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.490
Oh, my God, we had wine.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.030
You know, she's never made
a pass at me. Terrence,

38:23.230 --> 38:24.320
has Penelope ever made
a pass at you?

38:24.520 --> 38:26.240
Uh-uh. She knows
I'm a homosexual.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.330
- What? Since when?
- Since birth, probably.

38:28.530 --> 38:30.370
- But you're married.
- Oh, I left my wife years ago.

38:30.570 --> 38:31.370
I live with Maury now.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.960
From accounting? With the cold.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.380
Terrence, we need to talk more.

38:34.570 --> 38:36.790
Gabe, what do I tell my wife?

38:36.990 --> 38:40.210
- Your wife?
- Yes, my wife.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.590
Nothing.

38:41.790 --> 38:43.680
- Abe, nothing happened.
- Nothing happened,

38:43.880 --> 38:45.220
but something happened.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.010
But nothing happened.

38:47.210 --> 38:49.010
She'll know. She'll sense it.

38:49.210 --> 38:52.100
Abe, do not tell her
about Penelope.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.270
About you and me just now,
yes, but not her,

38:54.470 --> 38:56.440
and I promise never to put you
in that position again.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.440
You are too tempting.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.770
Gabe.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.190
- It's all in the past.
- Maybe.

39:01.390 --> 39:02.740
It's in the past.
Say it with me.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.700
[both] It's in the past.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.660
Good.

39:06.860 --> 39:09.280
- Wasn't Maury married?
- He lived with his sister.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.550
That was his sister?
I am so out of the loop.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.330
- [door opens]
- He's on the move!

39:16.530 --> 39:17.880
- He's on the move.
- He's on the move.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.550
- He's on the move.
- [bell rings]
- Where's Adam?

39:19.740 --> 39:21.630
- [Mel] Yeah, where is Adam?
- It's showtime.

39:21.830 --> 39:23.170
I was saying hi to my parents.

39:23.370 --> 39:25.180
- [Mel] What are you, 14?
- [overlapping chatter]

39:25.380 --> 39:26.550
[stage manager] Keep
the aisles clear.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.430
And if you do have to leave,
please do so quietly.

39:29.630 --> 39:32.020
Emergency exit doors are
on both sides in the back.

39:32.220 --> 39:33.930
Other than that,
make a lot of noise

39:34.130 --> 39:36.350
- when it comes to showing
Gordon you are happy to be here.
- [audience applauds]

39:36.550 --> 39:38.150
- Do we have a monologue?
- No idea.

39:38.350 --> 39:40.520
[stage manager] You sound like a
great audience, guys. Feel free

39:40.720 --> 39:42.110
to laugh at anything
you find funny,

39:42.310 --> 39:43.610
and applaud
when we light the sign.

39:43.810 --> 39:46.280
[audience cheers and applauds]

39:46.480 --> 39:50.120
Whoa. Whoa.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.740
We didn't even light the sign.

39:51.940 --> 39:54.250
- You're already
disobeying orders.
- [audience laughs]

39:54.450 --> 39:55.910
We got a great show tonight.
See you in a minute.

39:56.110 --> 39:58.130
[audience cheers, applause]

39:58.320 --> 40:02.090
Okay, so let's do Clark Gable,
Emily Post, the NASA joke,

40:02.290 --> 40:03.760
the automat joke
that we dropped on Friday--

40:03.960 --> 40:05.720
put that next to last-- and did
the Dennis the Red Menace thing

40:05.920 --> 40:07.380
- make it past the censors?
- They didn't flag it.

40:07.580 --> 40:08.470
We're basically saying
the kid's a communist.

40:08.670 --> 40:09.470
They didn't flag it.

40:09.670 --> 40:10.970
Put it in.
And I'll throw in a riff

40:11.170 --> 40:12.930
about the hat on the lady in the
second row. She wore that thing

40:13.130 --> 40:14.520
- to be noticed.
- You got it, boss.

40:14.720 --> 40:15.850
- Teddy?
- I thrive on this.

40:16.050 --> 40:16.890
Good man.

40:17.090 --> 40:18.440
The cavalry comes through again.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.440
[Midge] Wow.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.770
Right down to the wire.

40:20.970 --> 40:22.110
He keeps us on our toes.

40:22.310 --> 40:23.530
[stage manager] Places,
everyone.

40:23.730 --> 40:25.240
- Places, everyone.
- [bell rings]

40:25.440 --> 40:26.740
Sorry about before.

40:26.940 --> 40:30.030
I checked with a friend,
Paar did do that joke. Fuck me.

40:30.230 --> 40:32.370
Hey, Teddy, you posing
for the <i>Kama Sutra?</i>

40:32.570 --> 40:33.700
- [laughter]
- [Teddy] Up yours, Mel.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.080
- [theme music playing]
- Ladies and gentlemen,

40:35.280 --> 40:37.870
it's <i>The Gordon Ford Show!</i>

40:38.070 --> 40:39.040
[cheering and applause]

40:39.240 --> 40:42.340
Tonight's guests:
Angie Dickinson,

40:42.540 --> 40:45.460
Steve Lawrence,
and novelist Ray Bradbury.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.050
Now here's your host,

40:47.250 --> 40:49.760
Gordon Ford!

40:49.960 --> 40:51.900
[audience cheering]

40:55.490 --> 40:56.520
- [music ends]
- [chuckles]

40:56.720 --> 40:58.480
Thanks, everyone.
Thanks for coming out.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.400
It's getting festive here
in New York, isn't it?

41:00.600 --> 41:02.020
With all the twinkling lights

41:02.220 --> 41:03.610
and window displays
and chestnuts

41:03.810 --> 41:05.190
roasting over
an open trash can fire.

41:05.390 --> 41:06.940
- [laughter]
- He doesn't like us
in his eyeline.

41:07.140 --> 41:08.610
[Gordon] It's a generous
time of year.

41:08.810 --> 41:10.570
- My mom looks so old.
- [Gordon] A guy picked
the wallet

41:10.770 --> 41:12.660
right out of my pocket,
gave it back to me gift-wrapped.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.160
I mean it, it had a ribbon
on it and everything.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.250
George, you've had
your pocket picked.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.410
Did you ever get that original
copy of the Magna Carta back?

41:18.610 --> 41:19.870
[laughter]

41:20.070 --> 41:21.330
I told you not to carry
that thing around like that.

41:21.530 --> 41:24.000
- More fool me.
- [laughter]

41:24.200 --> 41:26.300
Of course, you've all heard
the sad news,

41:26.500 --> 41:28.510
- the great Clark Gable
has passed away.
- [audience] Aw...

41:28.710 --> 41:30.180
[Gordon] He's survived
by his wife, his children,

41:30.380 --> 41:32.470
and his mustache.

41:32.670 --> 41:35.390
Now, ma'am, is that a hat,
or is your hair on fire?

41:35.590 --> 41:36.680
[laughter]

41:36.880 --> 41:38.600
[Gordon] 'Cause we can help you.
We have firemen

41:38.800 --> 41:40.480
standing right outside.
They can rush right in here,

41:40.680 --> 41:42.370
hose you down real quick,
free of charge.

41:45.210 --> 41:47.900
How's Chaim? How's my baby boy?

41:48.100 --> 41:49.110
<i>[Noah] [over phone] Oh,</i>
<i>he's just the greatest</i>

41:49.310 --> 41:50.570
<i>little man on the planet.</i>

41:50.770 --> 41:51.610
You should have seen
the other day,

41:51.810 --> 41:52.950
he was playing
with a basketball,

41:53.150 --> 41:53.990
but he's so tiny,

41:54.190 --> 41:55.410
he rolled right over
the top of it

41:55.610 --> 41:56.910
<i>and did a complete somersault.</i>

41:57.110 --> 41:58.540
[chuckles] I wish I'd seen that.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.540
The ball landed on top of him.
He never let go of it.

42:00.740 --> 42:01.580
It was too cute.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.330
Noah, listen, I'm calling
with a question,

42:03.530 --> 42:04.670
then I'll let you go.

42:04.870 --> 42:06.800
- Sure.
- Could you order
a quick raid on an enemy?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.380
- Pardon?
- <i>I know the CIA</i>

42:09.580 --> 42:11.970
is very busy. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

42:12.170 --> 42:15.050
Mom, what? I'm an analyst.
I've told you a million times.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.510
<i>I wouldn't need to know</i>
<i>the details.</i>

42:16.710 --> 42:17.680
<i>I respect your privacy.</i>

42:17.880 --> 42:19.730
What enemy?
What are you talking about?

42:19.920 --> 42:23.440
It's this, uh, shall we say,
"coterie" I'm dealing with.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.570
I'm talking something fast,
unexpected, but severe.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.400
A very fast, hard attack.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.860
Well, short answer, Ma,
I cannot order a raid.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.950
Well, can I speak to someone
in the raid department, then?

42:33.150 --> 42:34.200
You could just
give me the number.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.620
We don't have a raid department.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.830
Ma, who the hell is this
"coterie" you want to raid?

42:38.030 --> 42:39.490
Just some women.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.120
They meet occasionally
in Coney Island,

42:41.320 --> 42:42.710
and I just thought,
if I knew they were there

42:42.910 --> 42:45.080
at a specific time, you could
firebomb it or something.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.590
Ma, I'm at work.

42:46.780 --> 42:48.130
Perfect, can you ask
a colleague?

42:48.330 --> 42:50.300
They sometimes monitor
these calls, Ma.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.880
We cannot talk about this.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.760
Oh. Well, should I
call back later?

42:53.960 --> 42:55.390
We could use a code word.

42:55.590 --> 42:57.640
- How about "flower girl"?
- No!

42:57.840 --> 43:00.060
Well, then should we meet
in the park at dusk?

43:00.260 --> 43:01.430
<i>I read about spies doing that.</i>

43:01.630 --> 43:03.810
I really can't continue
this conversation.

43:04.010 --> 43:05.270
Oh, your father's home.

43:05.470 --> 43:07.860
Abe, would you like
to say hi to Noah?

43:08.060 --> 43:09.150
Hi. [sighs]

43:09.350 --> 43:10.650
<i>Pop, what the hell</i>
<i>is going on with...</i>

43:10.850 --> 43:12.420
- Abe?
- Hi.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.200
Are you all right?

43:15.400 --> 43:17.620
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

43:17.820 --> 43:19.790
How was your day? Did you

43:19.980 --> 43:22.540
make some good matches
at the tearoom?

43:22.740 --> 43:25.170
Oh, yes. Yes, I, um,

43:25.370 --> 43:27.000
went to the tearoom.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.590
How was the tea?

43:28.790 --> 43:31.210
It was very nice.

43:31.410 --> 43:32.800
Corinne and I went there,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.800
and it was exactly
as it always is.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.800
- Very nice.
- That's nice.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.720
Mm. Did you have a nice day?

43:39.920 --> 43:43.390
Just a... typical, nice Monday.

43:43.590 --> 43:46.770
Yeah, ate dessert at my desk,

43:46.970 --> 43:49.190
typed some, the usual.

43:49.390 --> 43:50.820
What did you have for dessert?

43:51.020 --> 43:53.240
Did I say dessert? Lunch.

43:53.430 --> 43:55.170
I ate lunch.

43:59.420 --> 44:01.620
You want to go out to dinner?

44:01.820 --> 44:04.500
<i>Rose, that's awful.</i>

44:04.700 --> 44:07.370
I wasn't gonna tell you because
I didn't want to worry you.

44:07.570 --> 44:09.380
But it was just so upsetting,

44:09.580 --> 44:11.040
watching the place
burn like that.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.010
And the smell, oolong and ash.

44:14.210 --> 44:16.590
You know you can always
tell me anything.

44:16.790 --> 44:20.180
The tearoom was my office.
I met all my clients there.

44:20.380 --> 44:22.510
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without it.

44:22.710 --> 44:25.810
The whole place smelled
like a... wedding cake.

44:26.010 --> 44:27.540
[sighs]

44:32.080 --> 44:34.740
Abe. What is this?

44:34.930 --> 44:36.700
A fondly intentioned

44:36.890 --> 44:39.280
sexualized gesture.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.380
Oh.

44:43.390 --> 44:46.290
Well, it is past 7:00.

44:46.490 --> 44:49.080
Am I supposed to do
something in return?

44:49.280 --> 44:50.880
I think it's optional.

44:51.080 --> 44:52.850
Okay.

45:03.150 --> 45:05.470
- I told you there'd be drinks.
- <i>[Susie] But it's okay</i>

45:05.670 --> 45:07.060
because your outfit
was made for sitting,

45:07.260 --> 45:08.890
and you sit in a bar, right?

45:09.090 --> 45:10.520
The flare can accommodate that?

45:10.720 --> 45:12.440
You know, I'm tired
of people mocking me

45:12.640 --> 45:15.110
for thinking about how a dress
works in different situations.

45:15.310 --> 45:17.280
So, Toots Shor's
is their hangout, huh?

45:17.480 --> 45:19.450
They come here
because Gordon doesn't.

45:19.650 --> 45:21.200
He got into some fight
with Toots

45:21.400 --> 45:22.780
and won't set foot in the place.

45:22.980 --> 45:24.490
- They call it their sanctuary.
- <i>I got to start working</i>

45:24.690 --> 45:25.740
that place. It's a good place.

45:25.940 --> 45:27.790
Susie...

45:27.990 --> 45:29.870
- the job is weird.
- How so?

45:30.070 --> 45:31.670
They don't think I'm funny.

45:31.870 --> 45:32.790
Well, they don't have to,

45:32.990 --> 45:33.920
so long as Gordon
thinks you're funny.

45:34.120 --> 45:35.550
The day felt like a week,

45:35.750 --> 45:37.130
and we have to do it
all over again tomorrow

45:37.330 --> 45:38.920
and then the next day
and the next.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.390
Well, you better not fucking
call me about tomorrow's outfit.

45:41.580 --> 45:42.550
I won't.

45:42.750 --> 45:44.810
Now go mingle.
Make some friends.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.140
Be confident.
You love an audience.

45:47.340 --> 45:48.810
Think of those guys
as your audience.

45:49.010 --> 45:50.980
- <i>Use 'em.</i>
- I'll try.

45:51.180 --> 45:53.080
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

45:57.130 --> 45:58.990
[Mel] ...rushes ahead of me
at the front of the line,

45:59.190 --> 46:01.740
buys the same can of tuna
every day,

46:01.940 --> 46:03.320
89 cents.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.780
She's counting out pennies.

46:04.980 --> 46:08.330
[imitating old woman] "One, two,
I lost my place, one, two..."

46:08.530 --> 46:11.370
- I'm going nuts.
- [laughter]

46:11.570 --> 46:12.790
Sure?

46:12.990 --> 46:14.630
Harvard did teach me
manners, after all.

46:14.830 --> 46:17.210
Along with very useful Greek
and how to hit a shuttlecock.

46:17.410 --> 46:20.170
There's not a bomb
underneath it, is there?

46:20.370 --> 46:22.630
Are you kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:22.830 --> 46:24.010
[Ralph] He made peace
with Toots?

46:24.210 --> 46:25.010
[Alvin] Not to my knowledge.

46:25.210 --> 46:26.350
I personally
heard him call Toots

46:26.550 --> 46:28.010
a fat fuck not two weeks ago.

46:28.210 --> 46:29.060
They almost came to blows
that time.

46:29.260 --> 46:30.140
They had to be separated.

46:30.340 --> 46:31.520
- What changed?
- [Gordon] Hey, all.

46:31.720 --> 46:33.850
- Good show tonight.
- [others] Hey.

46:34.050 --> 46:35.400
Tough journey,
but we got it there.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.110
That's what Alvin's wife said
on their wedding night.

46:37.310 --> 46:38.860
[laughs] Actually, she did.

46:39.060 --> 46:40.530
- [laughter]
- Wow.
- So, Gordon,

46:40.730 --> 46:42.740
- you like the automat joke?
- Mm, it wasn't my favorite.

46:42.940 --> 46:45.120
- Good, it was Adam's.
- There's the guy.

46:45.310 --> 46:47.120
It got a laugh.
Means it's funny.

46:47.320 --> 46:50.080
I'll tell you what's funny.
Mike got me an advanced copy

46:50.280 --> 46:51.830
of "The 2,000 Year Old Man,"
that Mel Brooks thing.

46:52.030 --> 46:53.670
- Oh.
- Hilarious.

46:53.860 --> 46:56.840
Really, really funny.

46:57.030 --> 46:58.000
One of the funniest...

46:58.200 --> 47:00.130
I never said Mel Brooks
wasn't funny.

47:00.330 --> 47:03.010
But that bit would be nothing
without Carl Reiner.

47:03.210 --> 47:05.090
Right, 'cause without Carl, it
would be Mel awkwardly waiting

47:05.290 --> 47:07.260
half a minute in silence and
then reciting the punch line.

47:07.460 --> 47:08.600
Yeah, that would stink.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.240
I give up.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.440
Hey.

47:14.640 --> 47:15.650
Hi.

47:15.850 --> 47:17.060
How are these guys treating you?

47:17.260 --> 47:18.320
Terrific.

47:18.510 --> 47:19.610
She lied.

47:19.810 --> 47:21.190
They're a very good group
of writers,

47:21.390 --> 47:24.200
and I am thrilled to be here.
Learning a lot.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.990
Pleasure's ours.

47:26.190 --> 47:29.410
They give you any problems,
you come to me.

47:29.610 --> 47:31.410
Okay.

47:31.610 --> 47:32.870
All right, fellas,
I'm gonna grab a drink.

47:33.070 --> 47:34.000
- Next round's on me.
- Thanks.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.720
- You're too kind.
- Thanks, boss.
- That's nice of you, boss.

47:38.270 --> 47:40.210
What changed? That changed.

47:40.410 --> 47:41.590
What?

47:41.790 --> 47:43.420
Everything was the same today,

47:43.620 --> 47:44.800
except for the X factor.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.180
We just solved for "X."

47:46.380 --> 47:48.350
"X"? I'm not "X."

47:48.540 --> 47:50.970
- Look at that.
- Good to see you back, Gordie.

47:51.170 --> 47:52.850
- Ah, you're
looking good, Toots.
- I always look good.

47:53.050 --> 47:54.230
I'm gonna miss this place.

47:54.430 --> 47:55.640
We can go back
to that Irish pub.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.650
I can't sit through that
tin whistle leprechaun music

47:57.850 --> 47:58.900
anymore, I'll go crazy.

47:59.100 --> 48:00.400
You can come back here.

48:00.600 --> 48:01.480
There's that place on 59th.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.070
I swear you can come back here.

48:03.270 --> 48:04.110
What about PJ Clarke's?

48:04.310 --> 48:05.320
They measure their pours.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.670
I'm not "X."

48:16.970 --> 48:18.600
[winces]

48:26.190 --> 48:28.760
[chuckles]

48:28.960 --> 48:31.680
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

48:31.880 --> 48:33.720
<i>[Midge] So, I started</i>
<i>this new job,</i>

48:33.920 --> 48:36.850
and it's... not fun.

48:37.050 --> 48:39.150
Not that every job
is supposed to be fun. I mean,

48:39.350 --> 48:40.650
when a nurse
is inserting a catheter,

48:40.850 --> 48:41.980

there thinking,

"This looked so much more fun
in the brochure."

[audience laughs]

48:45.810 --> 48:49.200
And it's all men. Mm-hmm.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.490
So, I'm sitting in this room
with a bunch of men,

48:51.690 --> 48:53.240
and none of them are being nice

48:53.440 --> 48:55.080
or showing me the ropes,

48:55.280 --> 48:57.410
and so far none of them
seem to want to sleep with me.

48:57.610 --> 48:59.040
[audience laughs]

48:59.240 --> 49:00.790
It's the least they could do.

49:00.990 --> 49:03.670
Who raised these men,
not wolves?

49:03.870 --> 49:05.460
[audience laughs]

49:05.660 --> 49:08.170
Hey, did you hear there's gonna
be a baby in the White House?

49:08.370 --> 49:10.390
Little JFK Jr.

49:10.580 --> 49:11.930
It'll be a clean transition.

49:12.130 --> 49:13.100
White House staff
already learned how

49:13.300 --> 49:14.930
to change diapers
with Eisenhower.

49:15.130 --> 49:17.480
[audience laughs]

49:17.680 --> 49:19.560
I knew that was funny.
