WEBVTT

00:17.058 --> 00:18.101
What would I tell them?

00:18.184 --> 00:21.312
Well, I guess I would tell the readers
of <i>Stars and Stripes</i>

00:21.396 --> 00:23.648
that defeating the Air Force

00:23.732 --> 00:26.818
in the first annual Space Flag Games
felt great.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.739
We had a worthy adversary,
but we were able to vanquish them.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.574
Oh, yeah.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.325
I hate to flex,

00:34.617 --> 00:37.579
but we dropped them faster
than a Mark Ronson bass line.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.372
-"Flex"?

00:39.456 --> 00:40.707
Mm-hmm.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.501
Yeah.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.128
I don't know what that means.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.172
You don't even need to write that down.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.215
Bottom line, we had a great win.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.760
And much of the credit
goes to the person sitting to your right,

00:51.843 --> 00:53.136
Dr. Adrian Mallory.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.056
Tell me,
what makes your relationship work?

00:56.765 --> 00:57.599
Trust.

00:57.682 --> 00:58.975
And mutual respect.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.853
Certainly trust.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.647
Oh, and that is our time.
How fun was that?

01:04.731 --> 01:06.649
Thank you so much for this.
And do you need a picture?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.234
'Cause I can Photoshop it.
Not a problem.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.236
You want them on the <i>Enterprise?</i>
I'll do it. Fine.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.780
You want me to give this guy pointy ears?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.657
Can you even imagine
how funny that would be?

01:14.741 --> 01:17.952
So "flex" is like
when you're dunking on someone,

01:18.036 --> 01:20.413
but, like, you wanna do it in a cool way.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.416
God, I hate him. I hate him so much.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.251
I understand.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.338
You seem unusually peppy today.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.425
Did one of your favorite sporting teams
succeed in their goals?

01:32.509 --> 01:33.551
Can you keep a secret?

01:33.635 --> 01:37.055
I have a conjugal visit
with my wife today.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.390
Oh, my. When was the last one?

01:39.474 --> 01:43.353
Well, this'll be the first time
since she was sentenced six months ago.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.981
POTUS approved it
because of our big Space Flag win.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.609
So, in essence, I got you laid.
You're welcome.

01:50.026 --> 01:50.860
Don't be gross.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.279
And thanks for acknowledging me earlier.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.574
It's nice for my mother
when I'm mentioned in the papers.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.992
Your mother is still alive?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.494
Yes.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.537
Impressive.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.999
You know, a lot of centenarians
are living long, healthy lives.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.334
Probably due to better nutrition.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.503
How old do you think I am?

02:08.586 --> 02:09.462
Um...

02:09.546 --> 02:10.380
Hmm.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.593
What's going on?

02:15.677 --> 02:16.761
I don't know.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.058
What the hell?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.226
India?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.937
Can you zoom in on the exhaust mount?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.232
Enhance!

02:31.025 --> 02:31.943
Enhance!

02:32.235 --> 02:34.320
That's not how it works in real life.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.699
You can't create information from nothing.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.701
-I can increase the contrast.
- Yeah.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.954
-<i></i>
- Oh, whoa.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.790
That's a Pegasus fin system.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.001
But we're the only ones with Pegasus.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.085
I designed it.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.920
Don't be that way, Ranatunga.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.213
There's no "I" in "team."

02:52.297 --> 02:53.381
What does this mean?

02:53.464 --> 02:56.426
It could mean any number of things.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.721
Ah.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.514
Put it in a report.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.683
I've got my appointment to get to.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.770
Yeah, that's right. Your appointment.
Well, go get 'em, tiger. You earned it.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.398
What kind of appointment is this?

03:10.481 --> 03:11.649
-Dentist.
-Dentist.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.658
Can I help you, Major?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.455
Yes, so, tell me
about your cable package...

03:27.332 --> 03:29.375
Oh, you look nice, sir.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.669
I used cream rinse.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.588
Is that, like, a conditioner?

03:33.671 --> 03:35.673
Yes. Same-- Same thing.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.301
That's a very nice flower.
It's a nice touch.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.430
If there's a more perfect flower
than the rose, I've never seen it.

03:42.513 --> 03:46.768
So nice hair, nice flower,
what are we talking about?

03:46.851 --> 03:47.852
Anniversary?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.855
Uh, no. Nope.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.987
Have you ever heard the term
"conjugal visit"?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.324
Uh, yes.

04:03.284 --> 04:06.454
God, the hoops
that I had to jump through.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.497
The forms.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.251
And all of it has to do with,
"Well, is it consensual?"

04:11.334 --> 04:14.087
Of course it's consensual.
This is my wife.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.798
"How long? How long do you want?"

04:16.881 --> 04:19.217
Fifteen-minute--
It's all 15-minute increments.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.135
Are you kidding me? Fifteen minutes?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.513
Who can do anything in 15 minutes?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.474
We settled on 45 minutes.
That should do the trick.

04:26.557 --> 04:27.392
But...

04:34.148 --> 04:36.317
I probably shouldn't have said anything.
I'm--

04:37.735 --> 04:38.611
Um...

04:38.695 --> 04:42.490
No, sir. That's-- It's all part of--
part of being a person.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.535
Yeah.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.163
I'd appreciate it
if you could erase any images

04:49.247 --> 04:50.873
you now have in your mind.

04:53.126 --> 04:53.960
Yep.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.175
All right.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.512
Thank you.

05:08.891 --> 05:09.934
Oh.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.825
You can't see her.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.369
-What?
-Came from the White House.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.495
Check your phone.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.477
Wow, that was fast.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.104
-It was canceled.
-Oh, no.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.189
Here.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.704
POTUS is furious. Let's go.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.539
Me? Well...

06:13.623 --> 06:16.167
-I didn't do anything.
-If I'm in trouble, you're in trouble.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.880
<i>How did India get the Pegasus?</i>

06:20.963 --> 06:23.341
- That's what we're wondering.
<i>-Yeah, I'll tell you how.</i>

06:23.424 --> 06:27.136
<i>Because you got a goddamn spy over there,</i>
<i>and you better find him ASAP!</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:29.639
<i>The president has a name</i>
<i>for countries like India.</i>

06:29.722 --> 06:31.307
<i>A name I can't repeat.</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:33.518
<i>Jesus. The timing on this.</i>

06:34.018 --> 06:35.478
Timing?<i> </i>What do you mean?

06:35.561 --> 06:39.482
<i>It just comes on a very inauspicious day.</i>

06:40.233 --> 06:41.442
I'm not sure I follow.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.320
Oh, it's POTUS' birthday.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.530
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

06:45.822 --> 06:47.657
<i>But if I were you, I would be very aware</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:50.451
<i>of his desire</i>
<i>to have this day feel special.</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:51.661
I completely understand.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.996
Maybe we can launch something
of our own to celebrate the day.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.873
Do we have any missions ready to launch?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.417
The climate orbiter.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.836
<i>-Not that.</i>
<i>-</i>Why not?<i> </i>It's ready to go.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.254
<i>You know why.</i>

07:01.337 --> 07:04.424
<i>And find the goddamn spy</i>
<i>before this thing hits the news cycle.</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:06.926
<i>We need to nail somebody's head</i>
<i>to the wall on this thing,</i>

07:07.009 --> 07:08.636
<i>or else it's gonna be yours. Get it?</i>

07:08.719 --> 07:13.891
Given history, are we literally
going to nail someone's head to a wall?

07:13.975 --> 07:14.809
Of course not.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.019
<i>No, well, hold on now.</i>
<i>We don't know that for sure.</i>

07:17.103 --> 07:20.565
<i>Let's just find the spy,</i>
<i>and we'll talk about what comes next.</i>

07:20.648 --> 07:24.360
Since when has making the president happy
on his birthday

07:24.444 --> 07:25.903
become part of our mission?

07:25.987 --> 07:27.071
Tell me about it.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.491
I feel like the party clown
I hired on Erin's fifth birthday.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.703
At least I let him go home
with the rest of the cake.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.914
He looked hungry, tired...

07:37.915 --> 07:38.749
Hey!

07:38.833 --> 07:40.918
Are you eavesdropping
on a classified conversation?

07:41.002 --> 07:43.629
Sorry.<i> </i>Earbuds.<i> </i>I didn't--<i> </i>Earbuds.<i> </i>So...

07:52.847 --> 07:55.933
Everybody leave.
We need this space for a private meeting.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.394
Take that sandwich with ya. Take it to go.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.563
You too, Hildy.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.399
I will have an egg salad sandwich
on your way out.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.484
You want anything?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.777
What are your impressions
of the grilled cheese?

08:06.861 --> 08:09.155
Oh, my God. He's not hungry. Never mind.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.239
Have a muffin.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.867
All right, let's make a list.

08:12.950 --> 08:13.993
Who is the spy?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.662
Yuri, obviously. He's on Putin's payroll.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.331
Yeah.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.666
And Baxter. That guy gives me the creeps.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.669
Every time I'm anywhere near him,
he hides his cell phone.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.962
Mm-hmm. Uh...

08:25.046 --> 08:26.047
Chan. Definitely.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.424
Wait. Chan is my number two.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.551
I consider him above suspicion.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.762
All right, so we've got Yuri,
Baxter, Chan.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.931
-Brad.
-What? No way.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.851
Well, you come after my number two,
I'm gonna come after your number two.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.437
"You send one of mine to the hospital,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.523
I send one of yours to the morgue."

08:43.606 --> 08:44.899
What the fuck?

08:45.483 --> 08:47.360
Were-- Were you doing Nixon?

08:47.985 --> 08:49.862
What? No.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.197
Who was it?

08:52.448 --> 08:53.741
It was Sean Connery.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.700
Ah.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.537
My family's from Hong Kong.
Why would I help India?

08:59.121 --> 09:03.042
China and India are both part of Asia,
are they not?

09:04.377 --> 09:07.713
People can be very loyal
to their continents.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.676
I got nothing to hide.
You can go look in my browser history.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.345
Maybe you actually learn a thing or two
about BWAM.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.140
It stands for Black Women Asian Men.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.811
We're actually the least likely pairing
statistically in American couples,

09:21.894 --> 09:23.437
yet we have the highest marriage rates.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.982
So when we find each other,
it's actually a wonderful, wonderful--

09:26.065 --> 09:27.483
Enough. Enough.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.779
IT will do an invasive search
of your electronic history.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.407
Make no attempt to leave the country.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.783
And let me tell you something, mister,

09:35.866 --> 09:40.454
if we do not find this specialty porn,
you are in a lot of trouble.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.582
It's not porn.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.458
It's love.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.669
We will be the judge of that.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.547
Can we go talk to your number two now?

09:50.840 --> 09:51.716
Yeah.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.052
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.555
Brad, may I see you in my office, please?

09:57.638 --> 09:58.472
Uh, sure.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.558
May I come in, sir?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.352
-I asked you to come in.
-Ah.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.438
What can I do for you?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.815
Uh, is your calendar up to date?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.359
Can I make a reservation
at the Outback for you for tonight?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.402
No, Brad. Nope.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.280
Is it your car?
You want me to get it washed?

10:14.822 --> 10:17.325
Is it Erin? Do you need me to babysit
or drive her somewhere?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.909
-To her friend's house.
-Jesus, Brad.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.494
You're a one-star general. Act like it.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.954
-All right?
-Okay.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.541
Just warning you,
the Outback fills up quick.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.543
Brad, have a seat.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.004
Okay.

10:32.590 --> 10:37.803
Brad, have you ever seen
or done anything suspicious on base?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.767
Um... maybe.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.728
I don't know. Uh...

10:48.147 --> 10:49.148
Like what?

10:50.191 --> 10:51.651
Your leg's jiggling.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.235
Ah.

10:54.445 --> 10:58.240
Perhaps you called someone,
shared some information?

11:00.284 --> 11:01.285
Tony?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.329
Mm. No. A country.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.580
Oh.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.625
England?

11:07.708 --> 11:08.709
Close.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.505
This country we're talking about
was once ruled by England.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.549
Us.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.717
Us?

11:17.301 --> 11:18.844
-Us.
-How would that work, Brad?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.347
I don't know.
You said a country ruled by England.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.973
Yeah, it was once a colony.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.308
Oh, a colony.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.352
But it's further east than us.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.478
Okay. Don't encourage.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.646
Wow, this is, uh...

11:29.647 --> 11:31.524
Is it Can-- It's Canada.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.986
Yes, that's right.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.154
Oh, I did--

11:37.238 --> 11:38.531
-Good. Well done, Brad.
-Phew.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.907
Thank you. We're done.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.617
Oh! Okay.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.578
Well, if you change your mind
about the Outback, let me know.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.205
No, no, no. We're fine. Thank you.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.374
-I can call in some favors, you know.
- Thank you, Brad.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.126
-Apply a little pressure.
-No, no, we're good.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.794
-Thank you. Well done.
-All right. Very good then.

11:51.877 --> 11:52.962
Thanks. That was fun.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.049
He is not the spy.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.638
His eyes were empty,
like a department store mannequin.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.349
That man pulled me out of a burning F-16.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.767
I knew it was something.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.271
General, you want me to make a reservation
at The Bloomin' Onion?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.857
That's a menu item at the Outback, Brad.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.985
Oh, I--
No wonder they were giving me a hard time.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.820
Close the door, please.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.114
-Oh, my God.
- Bloomin' Onion.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.657
Now it's all ringing a bell.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.744
Uh-oh! Dr. Chan!

12:24.827 --> 12:25.911
There's my guy.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.997
Listen, I know we haven't had
enough time to connect,

12:28.080 --> 12:29.874
but, honestly, I love your vibe, man.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.710
I can't make you molly, Tony.
Go ask Dr. Chandreshekar.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.878
That's not why I'm here.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.171
Dr. Chandreshekar, you said?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.757
That's the molly person?
Doesn't matter. That's not why I'm here.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.883
It is POTUS's birthday,

12:38.966 --> 12:41.802
and he wants something special
from Space Force.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.053
Is this official business?

12:43.137 --> 12:47.683
Not exactly, but when we deliver something
cool and spacey for the big guy's big day,

12:47.767 --> 12:51.645
you, my friend, will get the gratitude
of a grateful president.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.940
Can you imagine how proud
your parents would be over in, uh...

12:55.024 --> 12:55.983
Mongolia?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.402
-Baltimore.
-Baltimore.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.362
That's insane. You have a Baltimore too?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.072
-That is crazy!
- Okay. Okay.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.325
Okay, all right. Let's think of a gift.
Together. As a team.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.494
Here we go. Uh, la, la, la...

13:06.577 --> 13:07.787
Do you have an invisibility cloak?

13:07.870 --> 13:10.164
Absolutely. Everyone's wearing one but me.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.042
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.627
Fuck you.

13:14.710 --> 13:15.669
That's not real.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.506
That's not real.
Let's think of something real together.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.883
Let's think of something real together.

13:23.385 --> 13:27.348
Hello, Miss Erin Naird,
if I recall correctly.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.851
You do recall correctly,

13:30.935 --> 13:33.187
even though we only met once.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.022
Three weeks ago.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.399
Stalker.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.902
Um...

13:40.110 --> 13:42.154
Well, I can't deny
you did make an impression.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.155
Oh.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.992
I left a little footprint on the soft,
Alabama soil of your brain.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.744
You remember where I'm from.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.038
Not exactly.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.375
Your accent says "dumb state,"
and I was going alphabetically.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.546
So, can I offer you a little "ack-eye"?

13:59.338 --> 14:00.548
Oh.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.550
Well, that's part of the reason
why I'm here.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.846
Last time we spoke,
I learned I might be saying that wrong.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.305
No!

14:08.389 --> 14:09.473
Fake news.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.477
It is pronounced "ah-sigh-ee."

14:15.229 --> 14:16.647
Look at you.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.234
You practiced in the mirror,
and you nailed it.

14:20.317 --> 14:24.238
For that,
you have earned the sacred berry bowl.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.033
Crowned with the Crunch of <i>Capitan.</i>

14:29.535 --> 14:30.494
You remembered my order.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.831
Yes, Duncan, it's hard to forget
the sight of a grown man

14:33.914 --> 14:36.166
ordering children's cereal
as a dessert topping.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.043
And you remembered my name.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.216
Well, we do try to make it special
here at Meal Armstrong.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.676
Formerly Orion's Melt.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.845
Formerly Area Fifty Yum.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.057
Y'all come back
and order some more, ya hear?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.525
Yo. What's up, nerds? What do you want?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.695
There, I knew it.
He's doing something with his phone.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.280
-Grab it!
-Hey. Come on.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.531
-Get it from him.
-Wait.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.658
Get his thumb on the screen.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.536
Open the screen. Get his thumb down.
Put his thumb on the screen.

15:13.954 --> 15:14.788
All right, good.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.333
Okay, let's see
who you've been feeding information to.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.668
Prime Minister Modi, perhaps?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.128
Go to texts...

15:21.629 --> 15:22.796
Kick Grabaston?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.298
The Air Force? What the hell?

15:24.381 --> 15:26.634
-All right, those are confidential.
-Not anymore.

15:27.718 --> 15:31.221
"Mark's wife had to go
to maximum security prison

15:31.305 --> 15:32.932
just to escape her marriage"?

15:33.807 --> 15:36.226
Actually,
she committed a very serious crime.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.187
-Okay, can I have my phone back?
-No, get away. Get away.

15:38.687 --> 15:39.897
This is from Kick.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.274
"Mark is the appendix of Space Force.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.442
Useless.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.235
And one day it will explode."

15:45.319 --> 15:47.321
You might wanna let your pen pal know

15:47.404 --> 15:50.699
the appendix is a safe house
for good bacteria.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.825
Thank you, Adrian.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.912
Let's see how it works
when I text him back as you.

15:55.412 --> 16:02.211
"Naird is handling
this India crisis brilliantly."

16:04.546 --> 16:05.381
He's responding.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.343
"Naird, is that you?" Shit.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.221
But he has to think
it's written by Baxter.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.639
So insult yourself.

16:13.722 --> 16:14.932
-Insult myself?
-Just--

16:15.015 --> 16:16.642
Voice to text.

16:16.725 --> 16:20.270
Mark is a little chunk ball
who looks like Uncle Fester

16:20.354 --> 16:21.730
with an ass so tight,

16:21.814 --> 16:24.316
he can make diamonds
from the corn in his turds.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.567
-Jesus, Adrian.
-Send.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.652
-Well--
-Come on.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.820
-He wrote back.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.863
- "LOL."
-Okay.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.824
Yeah. No. You know what?
Let's ram it home.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.409
What did Chan say about you?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.493
Enough, enough, enough.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.871
So you're not spying for India,
but you are spying for Kick.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.832
And I don't know which one is worse.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.167
I'm transferring you to Space Fence.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.252
Wait. Isn't that--

16:43.335 --> 16:47.047
Yeah, yeah, it's a monitoring station
on an island in the South Pacific,

16:47.131 --> 16:50.092
and, at high tide, it is mostly submerged.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.387
So I suggest that when you get down there,
you take the top bunk.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.515
I never did like Baxter.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.518
He eats a burrito
like he's slowly undressing it.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.436
Oof.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.354
-Who's next?
-Gentlemen.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.274
General, let me say I am very sorry

17:05.357 --> 17:08.318
for canceled sex visit
with your convict wife.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.821
-How do you know about that?
-From observation.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.406
The way you walk.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.658
Wait...

17:15.659 --> 17:16.785
you think I'm spy?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.912
The thought has crossed our minds, yeah.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.627
Please, my phone doesn't stop ringing.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.007
Like, "Yuri, why does India have Pegasus
and not Russia?

17:30.090 --> 17:31.133
What are we paying you for?"

17:31.633 --> 17:33.886
"Mr. President, Father, I am sorry."

17:33.969 --> 17:34.970
You see?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.139
Our interests, the same.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.599
Let Bobby help you.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.727
You don't need an advanced degree
to be FBI.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.187
Actually, you do.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.272
Most of them
are either lawyers or accountants.

17:45.355 --> 17:48.859
It's amusing
you consider those advanced degrees.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.070
So what do you think we should do?

17:51.653 --> 17:54.198
Do you have
all the security cameras checked?

17:54.281 --> 17:55.365
We have.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.867
They weren't helpful.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.579
Then ask yourself who installed them.

18:01.080 --> 18:01.997
Huh?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.543
Civilian contractor, Kelly King.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.379
He has a point.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.631
-Kelly?
-Maybe.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.799
She's so nice.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.259
I don't think it could be her.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.844
- No.
- Kelly?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.680
-Yeah.
-Kelly? Huh? Mmm.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.724
Get your fuckin' feet off the table.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.480
Okay, to figure out what the president
would want for his birthday,

18:26.563 --> 18:27.940
we have to think like him.

18:28.023 --> 18:28.941
-Okay.
- Go.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.527
"I'm the President. I implement new laws.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.530
-And I appoint heads of federal agencies."
-Holy shit. You're terrible at this.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.989
Okay, what about this?

18:36.073 --> 18:40.702
Is there some sort of liquid or serum
that turns an old man into a young person?

18:40.786 --> 18:43.664
What are stem cells?
Blood of a young thing? Like a baby?

18:43.747 --> 18:46.250
Doesn't work that way,
and it's morally questionable.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.168
I'm not trying to say
all the blood of a baby.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.088
Just, like, a little bit of blood
from a lot of different babies.

18:51.171 --> 18:54.800
Nobody's using all of their blood,
and I'm talking about the best babies.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.345
Okay, I'm not explaining it right,
but you're not even giving me a chance.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.098
-Because it's horrible.
-Okay, why don't you say something then?

19:01.765 --> 19:04.351
"I'm in the Oval Office.
A bill comes to my desk,

19:04.434 --> 19:07.146
I pass it into law
because that is my constitutional role."

19:07.229 --> 19:08.689
Fuck, I am bad at this.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.440
It's insane to me
that you have degrees in things.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.294
-Oh. Excuse me.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.629
- Ms. King!
<i>-</i>General Naird.<i> </i>Is everything all right?

19:32.713 --> 19:35.257
Yeah, I just happened
to be in the neighborhood,

19:35.340 --> 19:36.717
investigating some treason,

19:36.800 --> 19:38.760
and I thought I'd stop by and say hello.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.180
Oh. Uh.. okay. Hello.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.139
Hello.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.057
Are-- Treason, did you say?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.226
Yeah. Yeah. Probably.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.186
Little bit. Yep.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.021
-Little bit of treason?
-Perhaps.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.356
All right.
Well, I'm not involved, right?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.192
We don't know. We'll see.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.319
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Sure.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.737
-Can't wait.
-All right.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.032
In your video system,
are there any blind spots?

20:00.115 --> 20:00.949
No.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.995
Is there any way to physically photograph
the Pegasus without being recorded?

20:05.078 --> 20:10.334
No. Unless you had the password
and access to the system to reset after.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.669
-Does anybody have that?
-Just you.

20:13.795 --> 20:14.838
You set it up for me.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.008
-Well, yeah.
-So you have it too.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.177
Okay, should I get a lawyer?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.641
Do you mind
if I look into your eyes for a moment?

20:26.350 --> 20:28.477
Uh, no. Okay.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.368
-Okay. You're good.
-Okay.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.578
-Sorry about this.
-No, no.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.790
Oh, some dipshit
gave the Pegasus to India.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.208
Oh, motherfuckers.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.210
-Yeah.
-Sorry you're going through this.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.213
Well, maybe it's all for the best,
you know?

20:56.296 --> 20:58.173
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have been able to drop by.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.841
-Well, not for the best.
-No. Right.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.428
I mean, it's a huge breach,
so national security...

21:03.512 --> 21:05.597
-Yeah. Treason, and...
-Yes, it is.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.141
-All right.
-I hope you find the person, so I...

21:08.225 --> 21:09.601
-I gotta go. See ya later.
-All right.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.978
-Bye-bye.
-Stop by--

21:11.561 --> 21:12.646
Oh, God.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.108
We're getting nowhere.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.902
Agreed. Maybe we should put a stop to it.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.490
-Who, me?
-Hmm?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.158
Or him? What are-- Who--

21:28.578 --> 21:30.747
What-- What are you saying?

21:31.498 --> 21:33.166
Oh, my God. I'll be right back.

21:34.751 --> 21:38.422
-Why don't you just walk in the room?
-It's about Dr. Mallory.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.090
-What about him?
-Act natural.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.384
Like I just said something
to make you laugh.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.268
-What are we doing?
-I don't know, sir.

21:51.768 --> 21:52.936
I spoke to Wolf in IT.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.355
Two hours ago, Mallory sent an email

21:55.439 --> 21:58.150
to a random EarthLink address
with the message,

21:58.233 --> 22:01.570
"Searching our computers here.
Can't keep this on mine."

22:02.070 --> 22:03.488
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.866
Attached to the email
was a large video file.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.908
Double encrypted.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.535
What the hell do you think
he's trying to hide?

22:08.618 --> 22:09.828
I don't know. But laugh again.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.913
-That's good.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.498
That is funny, sir.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.750
Mm-hmm.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.419
Yeah. Yes, I made a joke.
And that's funny.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.920
Yes. You did.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.672
All right.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.382
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.217
Good joke, Brad.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.887
Brad is so funny.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.556
Is he really a general?

22:29.639 --> 22:30.557
Yes.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.642
That's unfortunate. What was that about?

22:33.226 --> 22:36.021
Nothing.
He was just talking about business cards.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.192
How's your snack? What is that, a pigeon?

22:40.275 --> 22:41.610
No, it's Cornish game hen.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.736
Ah.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.073
Hildy make that for ya?

22:46.156 --> 22:50.285
I thought she only warmed it up,
but I fear she may have cooked it herself.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.286
Mmm.

22:51.661 --> 22:52.621
Yeah.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.916
Yeah, food.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.459
Mmm.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.129
-What were we talking about just before?
-Ending the investigation.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.632
Right. You wanna end the investigation.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.343
Because you don't think
that there's really a spy.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.261
Actually, that thought
has crossed my mind.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.638
Okay.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.555
All right.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.391
Um...

23:13.016 --> 23:14.393
You know what? I, uh...

23:15.936 --> 23:18.897
I'm looking to send some encrypted emails.
Do you know how to do that?

23:19.314 --> 23:21.274
Um, not really.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.778
I mean, in terms of internet security,
I'm kind of all thumbs.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.779
Yeah.

23:26.613 --> 23:27.572
I believe you.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.366
I trust you.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.452
I trust you.
I trust you when you say that.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.372
Wait. Are you okay?
You're acting very strange.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.375
Am I? Yeah. Yeah. Strange. I--

23:39.292 --> 23:42.754
Why did you send a double-encrypted email
to an EarthLink address?

23:42.838 --> 23:45.340
Oh, God. No, Mark. Sorry.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.843
No, that has nothing to do
with the investigation.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.177
That's purely personal.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.262
I promise.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.222
So you have no problem giving me the code?

23:52.305 --> 23:56.435
Well, no, I wouldn't do that
because, as I said, it's purely personal.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.687
-Well, you leave me no choice. Security.
-Come on!

23:59.646 --> 24:01.440
You can't be serious.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.607
Oh, he's very serious.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.317
Security, seize him.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.986
No, no, no, don't seize him.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.738
Brad, since when are you giving orders?
Just take him.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.907
-Okay. Tase him!
-Don't tase him.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.076
Sorry, sir. But it felt good.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.411
Let's go.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.830
Oh, Jesus.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.331
With this oaf?

24:18.415 --> 24:19.958
Shit.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.921
<i>What is this?</i>
<i>They said it was an emergency.</i>

24:25.005 --> 24:26.256
-That's right.
-Mm-hmm.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.301
Because you're on the line
with F. Tony Scarapiducci

24:30.010 --> 24:34.514
with a birthday present
for POTUS from Space Force.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.725
<i>Yeah? What? A missile? Rocket?</i>

24:36.808 --> 24:39.436
Well, sure, a missile's loud.
Rocket's bright.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.562
But this?

24:42.189 --> 24:45.442
This is ten trillion times
louder and brighter.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.446
It's a star.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.909
That's right.
We are officially naming a star after him.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.118
<i>A star.</i>

24:55.202 --> 24:59.372
<i>Like on starregistry.com?</i>
<i>I got that for my grandkid last year.</i>

24:59.456 --> 25:00.665
Hit him with it, Chan.

25:01.124 --> 25:05.086
Fornax Zeta J160540 is a hypergiant.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.006
It has tremendous luminosities,
and, for the next 20 billion years--

25:08.089 --> 25:10.008
<i>Oh, no,</i>
<i>and this is what you wanna give POTUS</i>

25:10.091 --> 25:11.885
<i>on the day India whoops our ass?</i>

25:11.968 --> 25:15.263
<i>You are on my shit list, Scarapiducci!</i>
<i>And what's that other guy's na--</i>

25:16.264 --> 25:17.265
Whoo.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.808
-Nailed it, huh?
<i>-</i>That was close.

25:18.892 --> 25:19.976
He could see your face.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.394
The entire time.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.438
Why? Leaving does what?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.106
It's over. The whole thing's over.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.068
Okay, we've decrypted the first layer.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.027
Go ahead.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.820
Mark, don't do this.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.697
Too late.
You had your chance to come clean.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.616
It's clearly a video file.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.700
Play it.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.868
Mark, really, don't--

28:02.097 --> 28:06.851
Would you like to shoot at my feet
and I'll dance a bit?

28:06.935 --> 28:11.022
Or, you know what?
I may have a diary from high school,

28:11.106 --> 28:16.361
and we could read that out in installments
over the campus PA system.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.114
Would that be sufficient humiliation?

28:19.197 --> 28:21.074
Everyone, please leave.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.910
May I remind you that everything
you saw and heard today

28:23.993 --> 28:25.161
is highly classified.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.664
So not a word to anyone. Thank you.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.049
I am so sorry, Adrian.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.428
Am I free to go?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.471
I did not mean to embarrass you.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.515
Don't bother. Am I free to go?

28:45.598 --> 28:46.474
Of course.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.103
Relationships are very difficult.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.104
I...

28:51.896 --> 28:54.232
No one's going to remember this, Adrian.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.525
-Everyone--

28:55.608 --> 28:56.651
Hold on.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.319
It's the Sec Def.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.698
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.325
We are still in pursuit of the spy.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.578
<i> Yeah, there is no spy.</i>

29:07.036 --> 29:07.871
What?

29:07.954 --> 29:11.958
<i>Our intelligence now suggests</i>
<i>India just beat us to the punch.</i>

29:12.041 --> 29:14.085
So India was just...

29:14.169 --> 29:15.044
Smarter.

29:15.795 --> 29:16.629
It happens.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.631
<i>You guys better get your act together</i>
<i>over there.</i>

29:18.715 --> 29:19.799
<i>POTUS is pissed.</i>

29:19.883 --> 29:23.219
<i>I'm going to his birthday party right now.</i>
<i>Expect a nuke storm on Twitter.</i>

29:26.097 --> 29:27.182
Hey. Um...

29:29.100 --> 29:32.479
Jerome was by far
my favorite person in the lunar habitat.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.605
He's a great guy.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.695
I noticed you had a spark
with that contractor.

29:40.904 --> 29:41.780
Oh...

29:41.988 --> 29:42.906
Kelly.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.491
Yeah.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.450
She's nice.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.994
Guess we had a little connection.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.415
I am married, of course, so...

29:53.041 --> 29:55.376
I probably should never talk to her
ever again.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.091
Sorry you missed your dentist appointment.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.092
Thanks.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.220
I'll floss later.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.224
Yeah.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.446
Okay, POTUS just tweeted.
Here it comes.<i> </i>Here it comes.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.616
"Just got the best birthday present ever.

30:26.699 --> 30:29.494
Giant hyper star
officially named after me.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.663
Brightest-known star in the galaxy.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.164
Cannot be taken back.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.999
It is officially registered.

30:35.083 --> 30:39.379
Thank you to my very loyal
secretary of defense, whose idea it was."

30:40.672 --> 30:41.673
He fucked us.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.050
It's a gas giant.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.262
When it collapses on itself
in 20 billion years,

30:48.137 --> 30:49.389
we'll have the last laugh.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.101
We did good, right?

30:55.353 --> 30:56.312
We did great.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.319
