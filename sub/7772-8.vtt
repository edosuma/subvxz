WEBVTT

00:12.567 --> 00:14.633
- Uh, as you know, we've been
studying American History,

00:14.733 --> 00:17.333
and that's why I'm so proud
to introduce you

00:17.433 --> 00:20.300
to a very special
and patriotic guest--

00:20.400 --> 00:21.567
- Why are you talking
from the other room?

00:23.233 --> 00:25.133
- Not a real drum.
- The 35th President,

00:25.233 --> 00:29.733
John F. Kennedy!
Kennedy! Kennedy!

00:29.833 --> 00:31.000
Hello, Gene.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.733
I'm here to tell you all about

00:32.833 --> 00:36.467
a very tumultuous time
in our country's history,

00:36.567 --> 00:38.300
the 1960s.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.633
- Didn't you get
shot in the head?

00:39.733 --> 00:42.000
- That's right.
Very impressive, Gene.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.167
I did get shot in the head.

00:44.733 --> 00:46.567
I--

00:46.667 --> 00:48.167
- 'Cause your brain bits would
be all over your lap and stuff.

00:48.267 --> 00:50.300
- I read the paper the next day,
and I saw that I--

00:50.400 --> 00:52.867
- Oh, so you're a ghost
that reads?

00:52.967 --> 00:54.467
- No, I...
no, I--

00:54.567 --> 00:56.300
Playing JFK?

00:56.400 --> 00:57.700
- He played a detective--
- Oh, I never saw it.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.733
- That was researching
the assassination.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.533
- I never watched it.
It looked boring.

01:01.633 --> 01:03.367
- How do you not know
anything about anything,

01:03.467 --> 01:05.133
but you know everything
about JFK?

01:05.233 --> 01:06.767
- So you are Billie!

01:06.867 --> 01:07.767
I called it.
- No, I--

01:07.867 --> 01:09.167
- I knew it when you walked in.

01:09.267 --> 01:10.200
I was like,
"That's Billie."

01:10.300 --> 01:11.800
- I had a whole thing planned,

01:11.900 --> 01:14.200
and I would do my--was
working on my accent.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.667
- Yeah, it's good.
It's a horrible accent.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.267
- No--
- Keep doing it.

01:17.367 --> 01:19.800
- Okay, um,
"But because of that conflict"--

01:19.900 --> 01:21.500
"

01:21.600 --> 01:22.767
- Conflict.
- Oh, conflict.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.633
- "And upheaval."
- Upheaval.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.167
- "Of the time,
we are now closer than ever

01:27.267 --> 01:29.833
to being
an equal opportunity society."

01:31.600 --> 01:34.300
- If we're an
equal opportunity society,

01:34.400 --> 01:36.767
why haven't I been served
my lemonade yet?

01:36.867 --> 01:39.600
Hmm?
Think about that.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.300
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:41.400 --> 01:43.267
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:43.367 --> 01:44.933
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:45.067 --> 01:46.967
Ha ha!

01:49.300 --> 01:52.433
- Ugh, too mushy.

01:52.533 --> 01:55.267
Too hard.

01:55.367 --> 01:56.767
Oh, just right.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.267
That's good.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.767
- You just said
that one was good.

01:59.867 --> 02:01.833
- Yeah, I don't care
for peaches personally.

02:01.933 --> 02:03.333
- Gene, you're being a brat.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.267
You're just making a mess
for Joy to clean up.

02:05.367 --> 02:07.167
- Joy doesn't clean those up.
Do you, Joy?

02:07.267 --> 02:08.333
- Sí.

02:08.433 --> 02:09.567
- "Sí" means yes.

02:09.667 --> 02:10.800
You're a saint,
by the way, Joy,

02:10.900 --> 02:11.833
to put up with this.

02:11.933 --> 02:13.600
- Kiss-ass.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.067
You totally deserve a raise
for putting up with that.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.233
- You were just
throwing peaches on the ground.

02:17.333 --> 02:20.600
- Oh my god, you're obsessed
with the peaches right now.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.067
Okay?
We've moved on

02:22.100 --> 02:24.333
to Joy.

02:24.433 --> 02:25.967
- Selfish.
- Uh-huh.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.767
You do deserve a raise, though.
I agree.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.300
- Mr. Russell
doesn't give raises.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.333
I do get to keep
Gene's hand-me-downs.

02:32.433 --> 02:35.467
- Okay, I'm sorry,
that's crazy

02:35.567 --> 02:36.733
that you've never
gotten a raise.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.067
- Yeah, she's right.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.267
You need to get you
some paper, son.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.067
Go in, make your case.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.133
He'll go for it.
- Oh, I know what you should do.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.467
She's gotta "Shark Tank" it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:45.567 --> 02:46.800
- What is Sharks--
- "Shark Tank" it!

02:46.900 --> 02:48.733
- Okay!
- "Hi, Mark Cuban,

02:48.833 --> 02:50.300
can I have some money?"

02:50.400 --> 02:51.733
- That's such a good impression,
"Shark Tank" it!

03:03.767 --> 03:05.067
- Oh.
Hey, Joy.

03:05.133 --> 03:07.867
I don't think the trash
is too full,

03:07.967 --> 03:10.267
but I am glad you are here.

03:10.367 --> 03:12.600
I want to talk to you
about the menu

03:12.700 --> 03:14.300
for the big dinner party
this weekend.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.233
- Mr. Kent.
- Hmm.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.467
I've been with this family
for a very long time now.

03:18.567 --> 03:20.633
And I do
whatever is asked of me.

03:20.733 --> 03:24.200
That's why I'm here to ask
for a 10% raise

03:24.300 --> 03:27.400
in a 100% stake
for the rest of my job.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.133
Are you "Shark Tanking" me?

03:31.233 --> 03:33.100
- I can't take anything
less than 10%.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.600
- You are "Shark Tanking" me.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.300
Joy,
you know I don't give raises,

03:39.400 --> 03:41.567
and yet here you are
asking for one.

03:41.667 --> 03:44.067
And for that reason...

03:44.167 --> 03:45.867
I'm out.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.367
- I saw this cool movie
last night.

03:48.467 --> 03:49.633
- Yeah.
"

03:49.733 --> 03:50.933
- Everyone's seen
"Forrest Gump."

03:51.067 --> 03:52.100
- I don't think so.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.767
- What do you think
"Run, Forrest"--

03:55.567 --> 03:58.100
- I listened to your
stupid advice and I got fired.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.533
- He fired you.

03:59.633 --> 04:01.667
- Gene!

04:01.767 --> 04:04.267
- I'm so sorry, Joy, I feel
like this is partially my fault.

04:06.967 --> 04:08.500
This is all your fault.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.200
You think you're so smart
because of your books

04:11.300 --> 04:13.500
and your degrees
and your maxi pad

04:13.600 --> 04:15.767
you left in your underwear
that I had to throw out

04:15.867 --> 04:17.267
before I washed them?

04:17.367 --> 04:19.100
- I can assure you,
I did not know

04:19.200 --> 04:20.933
about the last thing until now.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.933
- Goodbye, ladies.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.500
- I feel so bad.
- You should feel bad.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.167
That's  disgusting.
I mean, I'm grossed out. Me.

04:33.267 --> 04:34.867
- About Joy.
- Oh, right.

04:34.967 --> 04:36.867
- I can't believe he fired her.
I mean, you can't just

04:36.967 --> 04:38.533
throw people away
like trash.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.333
- Yeah, you should leave 'em
in your underwear

04:40.433 --> 04:41.567
for the maid to find.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.667
- Hey, Joy.
Um, it's me.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.200
Your phone's doing that thing
where it rings once

04:45.300 --> 04:47.233
and goes right to
voicemail--which is cool.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.733
Totally cool.
I wanted to say how much

04:48.833 --> 04:51.100
I really hate you--
- Message complete.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.367
- Not being here!

04:52.467 --> 04:54.867
I hate you not being here!

04:54.967 --> 04:56.667
God.
- Oh, Billie.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.500
Yikes,
first you get her fired,

04:58.600 --> 05:00.433
now you're leaving her
hate messages?

05:00.533 --> 05:03.900
- I didn't get her fired.
Your dad is being ridiculous.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.800
- Well, we were a part
of that too.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.333
Damn it.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.167
No--no, no!

05:10.267 --> 05:12.967
How am I supposed to eat
with no Joy?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.467
- That's it.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.400
- That's it!
We'll go on a hunger strike.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.633
Huh?
Action through peaceful protest,

05:19.733 --> 05:23.067
like our brothers and sisters
of the '60s, baby!

05:23.133 --> 05:27.067
- Yes, I am so in.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.633
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

05:28.733 --> 05:31.300
Except, I believe
it's called a "hunger stroke."

05:31.400 --> 05:33.367
- It isn't.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.300
- You're still eating.
- Oh, right.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.667
- Spit it out.

05:37.767 --> 05:40.233
Don't put that in your mouth.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.800
- Oh, my gosh, Joy's back!

05:41.900 --> 05:43.500
- I never looked away.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.067
- Well, say
what you will about Joy,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.167
but she made a mean eggplant.

05:48.267 --> 05:50.967
- You can't plant eggs.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.567
Well, you probably noticed that
Gene and I aren't eating,

05:55.667 --> 05:57.667
and I'm sure
you're wondering why.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.867
- I actually hadn't.
- We're on hunger strike.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.900
- Not a hunger stroke,
though it's totally normal

06:02.067 --> 06:03.567
if you thought
it was called that.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.100
- And we're not going to eat
until you hire Joy back.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.633
- Gene's eating right now.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.233
- I need it, I need it!

06:09.333 --> 06:11.833
- Look ladies, do you know why
a shark has no memory?

06:11.933 --> 06:13.700
- No.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.600
A true predator
never looks back.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.200
- I don't know
if that's factual.

06:18.300 --> 06:19.500
- Word is "actual."

06:19.600 --> 06:21.700
- You can even
not eat as much as you like,

06:21.800 --> 06:25.433
but I'm not budging.
How does that strike you?

06:25.533 --> 06:27.300
- It strikes me like lightning.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.467
As in, never.

06:28.567 --> 06:29.767
Which is how much I'm gonna eat,

06:29.867 --> 06:31.200
and this one's gonna eat,

06:31.300 --> 06:33.967
until Joy gets back in here.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.633
Using her maid legs!

06:35.733 --> 06:36.800
Get him, Billie!

06:36.900 --> 06:40.467
- And...
that's a... fact.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.100
- Oh, Billie,
you're awful at this.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
- Hope for domestic rights!

06:45.800 --> 06:47.667
Hope for domestic workers!

06:47.767 --> 06:49.200
Hope for freedom--
- Stop yelling!

06:49.300 --> 06:50.900
Who are you talking to?

06:51.067 --> 06:53.200
Sorry, I'm just cranky
'cause this protest sucks.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.100
There's no people here
but us and New Chet.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.867
- Yeah, man, and this sign stick
is giving me hella splinters.

06:58.967 --> 07:01.667
- You guys, don't worry.
This is how all movements start.

07:01.767 --> 07:04.233
Plus, I called my old college
buddies from Baked Earth.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.767
They will make it happen.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.667
- Your buddies sound like
hippies. I hate hippies.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.433
- They are a conscious
collective of peace warriors.

07:10.533 --> 07:12.133
Oh--oh, great.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.433
Here comes
another protestor.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.300
See?
It's already working.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.233
- Oh, and she went all out,
wearing a sexy maid's uniform.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.500
- Ah!
- Stop it.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.300
- Hello, I'm the new maid, Hope.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.833
Drop--drop, drop!

07:23.933 --> 07:25.233
What do we do?
- Come on, lock paws.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.333
Form a wall of resistance.
- Hey, hey.

07:27.433 --> 07:28.933
Baby girl, you want
to get in there?

07:29.067 --> 07:30.900
You gots to get by us.
- Yeah.

07:31.067 --> 07:32.567
- Yeah, and we're gonna
eat your ass

07:32.667 --> 07:34.433
- Uh-uh.
- Beat your ass!

07:34.533 --> 07:36.667
I'm sorry, I haven't eaten.
It's very difficult for me.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.433
- I could make you something.
- Oh, yeah--

07:38.533 --> 07:39.667
- She doesn't want it.
- I would love a grilled cheese.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.067
- Or like--
- War on hunger--

07:41.133 --> 07:42.633
- Oh, there you are.
Come on in.

07:42.733 --> 07:45.067
Big dinner party tonight.
Lots of things to do.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.900
Excuse me.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.567
- Just because you hired
someone knew does not mean

07:48.667 --> 07:50.500
you will break our spirit,
Mr. Russell.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.400
- Gene's eating again.
- Don't!

07:52.500 --> 07:53.733
- Scab!

07:56.600 --> 07:57.833
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?

07:57.933 --> 07:59.400
- Oh, yeah, sure.
What's on your mind?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.400
No!

08:01.500 --> 08:03.400
- Hey. Look at me.
- Huh.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.800
- I don't know
where this came from--

08:04.900 --> 08:06.900
- My pocket.
- But you do not throw food

08:07.067 --> 08:09.067
or beat ass
in a non-violent movement.

08:09.133 --> 08:11.933
Violence is not the answer.
- Violence is always the answer!

08:12.067 --> 08:14.467
- Always!
- Okay, I--look, I am just

08:14.567 --> 08:17.067
gonna go talk to her,
tell her whazzup.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.767
Why are you saying that to me?

08:18.867 --> 08:21.067
- Oh, like "What's going on,"
I didn't mean to,

08:21.167 --> 08:22.933
like, do it, like...

08:23.067 --> 08:25.100
- Billie,
- Wha--once she sees

08:25.200 --> 08:26.433
what we're doing--
- Mm-hmm.

08:26.533 --> 08:28.867
She will stand
in solidarity with us.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.267
Hey, give me some ski--

08:32.733 --> 08:34.400
- She's the most racist
person I know.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.900
You look hungry.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.633
- I--I am,
but I can't.

08:39.733 --> 08:42.067
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.633
You see, Gene--
- The one who threw

08:43.733 --> 08:45.333
the pizza at me?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.967
She's like, a child.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.667
- Um, the thing is,
the last maid got fired.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.167
- Oh.
- And it was, like,

08:53.267 --> 08:57.633
totally unjustified,
so we're actually not eating

08:57.733 --> 08:59.267
until Kent
hires her back again.

08:59.367 --> 09:02.400
So, it would actually
really help us out

09:02.500 --> 09:05.133
if you would just, like,
quit.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.867
- Leave.

09:11.267 --> 09:14.067
No, no, what I do is
a lot more specialized.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.667
Not that you're not special.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.733
I mean, I think
you're probably really special.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.067
Not in a like,
"Oh, she's so special,

09:20.100 --> 09:21.733
get her a slice of cake"
sort of way,

09:21.833 --> 09:22.733
I don't know,
you know what I mean.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.067
- Did you just call me a--
a "white puta?"

09:27.133 --> 09:30.100
- No.
- All right, good first talk.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.100
- Yeah.
- Hopefully the first of many.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.867
Hope!

09:32.967 --> 09:34.367
- What a lot of people don't
know, though, is Malcolm X

09:34.467 --> 09:36.500
started the Black Panthers
because he was

09:36.600 --> 09:37.867
a "Pink Panther" fan.

09:37.967 --> 09:39.367
- Oh, really.
- Yeah.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.333
- Who doesn't love
Peter O'Toole?

09:44.100 --> 09:45.700
- Hmm.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.667
- Gene!
I didn't...

09:47.767 --> 09:49.500
How'd it go?
- She's not quitting.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.433
- Oh. Okay, well, then,
let's do this, you know?

09:51.533 --> 09:53.700
- Come on, don't give up.
- We're not doing

09:53.800 --> 09:55.767
the peaceful protest crap
anymore, Billie, okay?

09:55.867 --> 09:57.533
It didn't work!
My dad doesn't care.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.000
So unless you have
a better idea,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.167
viva la pizza.

10:02.267 --> 10:05.400
- So good.
You should taste how it tastes.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.367
Oh, , hippies.
New Chet, get the crossbow.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.033
- Oh, no, no, no.
They're not hippies.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.900
They're from Baked Earth.
They're here to help.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.867
Hi, thank you
for your presence.

10:13.967 --> 10:15.400
- Namaste.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.833
- These are some
ugly-ass chicks.

10:20.933 --> 10:25.500
*

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
- Hi, everyone.
Thank you all for coming

10:27.700 --> 10:30.700
to this peaceful demonstration
for our sister Joy.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.400
We need to educate
people about

10:33.500 --> 10:34.767
workers' rights
for a fair wage.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.667
- We can't hear you!
- Yeah!

10:36.767 --> 10:38.500
Uh,
human megaphone everybody!

10:38.600 --> 10:39.900
It's pretty quiet out.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.900
all: Really?
It's pretty quiet out!

10:42.000 --> 10:44.433
- Seriously, I'm pretty sure
you can all hear me just fine.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.733
all: Seriously, I'm pretty sure
you can all hear me just fine.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.000
- Logically,
if you're repeating

10:49.100 --> 10:50.667
everything I say,
you can hear me.

10:50.767 --> 10:52.100
all: Logically,
if you're repeating

10:52.200 --> 10:53.833
everything I say,
you can hear me.

10:53.933 --> 10:58.567
- Oh, I'm from England!
all: Oh, I'm from England!

10:58.667 --> 11:00.467
- This is so stupid.
I hate these people.

11:00.567 --> 11:02.733
all: This is so stupid.
I hate these people.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.733
- Ow, you're hurting my arm--
- Quit being such a baby!

11:05.833 --> 11:07.300
This is a disaster.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.867
Those people out there smell
like BO and cashews!

11:08.967 --> 11:11.167
- I love cashews.
They're the elite nut.

11:11.267 --> 11:12.733
- Listen to me.
I get it now.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.533
Joy is a real person.
She deserves a real protest.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.400
But those people
out there

11:17.500 --> 11:18.833
They don't care about
getting Joy back.

11:18.933 --> 11:21.067
I heard one of them go,
"Who's Joy?"

11:21.100 --> 11:24.067
That's how they talk, Billie!
That's how they talk naturally.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.833
Those people are just here
to crash between Phish concerts.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.333
- What the hell's
a fish concert?

11:28.433 --> 11:30.300
Like, a bunch of fish
playing instruments?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.900
- Is that really
your first guess?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.233
- No, you're right.
That's crazy.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.500
It's gotta be, like,
a bunch of people

11:35.600 --> 11:38.467
using fish to play instruments.
Yum.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.700
- Yum, fish!
I'm Billie!

11:40.800 --> 11:41.767
That's all I think about,
is food.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.600
Look at me!
Ahh!

11:43.700 --> 11:45.067
- That's 'cause I'm actually
doing the hunger strike.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.867
- Me, too!
What do you think I'm doing?

11:46.967 --> 11:48.367
Do you know how many calories
I've had today?

11:48.467 --> 11:49.633
- 5,000!

11:49.733 --> 11:51.300
Gross.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.700
- I need to eat.
I'm growing, Billie.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.867
- No, you're not growing.
- Yes, I am!

11:55.967 --> 11:57.800
I hope you have nightmares.
Indian nightmares.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.067
- Oh, no, no!
Oh!

12:00.100 --> 12:01.800
- Attention!
- Attention, circus folk.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.200
- Your head's a tennis ball.

12:03.300 --> 12:07.267
- You are all trespassing,
and my lawn

12:07.367 --> 12:10.067
smells like dirty cashews.
- I told you.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.833
- Mr. Russell,
we're not going anywhere

12:12.933 --> 12:14.333
until you hire Joy back.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.800
- Free O.J. Simpson!

12:17.900 --> 12:19.933
all: Now!

12:20.067 --> 12:21.933
- My dinner guests are
going to be arriving soon.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.067
I don't want them accosted
by a bunch of

12:24.133 --> 12:26.167
shower-phobic vegans.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.067
- You can end this whenever
you want, Mr. Russell.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.633
You just have to do
the right thing.

12:29.733 --> 12:31.133
- Have it your way.

12:32.867 --> 12:35.333
[Connie Conway's
"Brighter Side" plays]

12:35.433 --> 12:39.167
No!

12:39.267 --> 12:41.433
*

12:41.533 --> 12:46.533
* There's a brighter side

12:46.633 --> 12:50.700
* To every dark, dark cloud

12:50.800 --> 12:55.567
* And there's a smiling face

12:55.667 --> 13:00.800
* In every crowd

13:00.900 --> 13:04.233
* There's a brighter

13:04.333 --> 13:11.433
* Brighter side

13:19.233 --> 13:27.167
*

13:35.233 --> 13:37.500
- You got it.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.200
- Yeah,
but see the S's are fives.

13:41.300 --> 13:45.533
Welcome to the revolution.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.200
She's here.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.067
- Oh. Hey, Billie.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.600
You've awakened.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.267
- Your tactics didn't work.
You lost.

14:02.367 --> 14:05.533
The only thing my dad
responds to...is strength.

14:05.633 --> 14:09.667
It's time to fight fire
with flamier fire.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.433
- Gene, I don't know
what you're planning to do,

14:12.533 --> 14:14.467
but I know it is a bad idea.

14:14.567 --> 14:17.333
- You know, my bad idea
was letting you be in charge

14:17.433 --> 14:18.767
in the first place.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.267
You were never willing
to do what it takes.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.900
You were never willing
to go all the way.

14:24.067 --> 14:26.133
- You thought a hunger strike
was called a "hunger stroke."

14:26.233 --> 14:28.400
- Yeah, and we may never know
who was right on that one.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.633
- It's me. I'm 100%.
- Well, perhaps.

14:30.733 --> 14:33.100
It's that arrogance that makes
you such a weak leader.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.333
- This is crazy.
Joy would not want any of this.

14:36.433 --> 14:40.400
- Why don't you let
Joy tell you what Joy wants?

14:42.333 --> 14:44.633
- Gene's plan might be crazy
enough to work...

14:44.733 --> 14:46.800
white puta.
- I'm sorry...

14:46.900 --> 14:49.233
I haven't eaten in 36 hours.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.267
Did you just call
me a white puta?

14:51.367 --> 14:55.067
- No. I said viva la revolución,
white puta.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.067
- You definitely
said it that time.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.933
- Yeah, time you did.
- I did.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.133
- Let's just say tonight's
turkey is gonna be da bomb.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.633
- No. No!

15:09.733 --> 15:12.200
This is a non-violent
movement!

15:12.300 --> 15:15.067
Make love, not war!

15:15.167 --> 15:18.633
The five dollar foot long!
- Hey, everyone, stop.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.633
What?
- I-I don't know.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.533
I'm feeling a little
lightheaded.

15:23.633 --> 15:24.900
I--uh-oh.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.467
I think I'm gonna
pass out again.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.400
- Billie, you're fine.
- I'm passing out.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.433
That would be, like,

15:32.533 --> 15:35.867
a bunch of people using fish
to play instruments.

15:35.967 --> 15:39.433
Is that fajitas?
I haven't eaten in 36 hours.

15:39.533 --> 15:42.200
"Yum, fish!"
There's gonna be meat.

15:42.300 --> 15:46.567
- So, unless you have
a better idea, viva la pizza.

15:46.667 --> 15:50.733
- Imagine all the pizza.
Imagine.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.467
Konichiwa.

15:52.567 --> 15:55.067
Gene, what are you doing?

15:55.133 --> 16:00.333
- You were never willing
to go all the way.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.967
- Words.

16:03.067 --> 16:06.333
- The S's are fives!

16:06.433 --> 16:08.600
- Ha ha ha ha ha.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.200
It's a gun.
For violence.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.067
- No.

16:13.133 --> 16:17.600
.

16:19.300 --> 16:22.867
- Let's just say
the turkey's gonna be the bomb.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.200
The turkey will be the bomb.
The turkey will be the bomb.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.400
The turkey will be--

16:27.500 --> 16:29.167
- The turkey's a bomb!

16:29.267 --> 16:33.733
- And to Mr. Sasaki for coming
all the way from Kyoto.

16:33.833 --> 16:36.367
- Cheers.

16:36.467 --> 16:39.067
- I have
a very important message

16:39.100 --> 16:41.167
I want to share with you
for the future.

16:41.267 --> 16:45.067
- You're all gonna die!
- Jesus Christ, Billie.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.167
What's this about?
- Get out! Get out!

16:47.267 --> 16:51.433
This thing's gonna blow!
Oh oh oh!

16:54.700 --> 16:57.567
That's so good.
It's so moist.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.500
- Billie,
what the hell are you doing?

17:00.600 --> 17:02.900
- You.

17:03.067 --> 17:05.233
You wouldn't listen.
You radicalized Gene.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.500
Because
you're so hard-headed,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.500
Gene put a bomb in the turkey!

17:13.633 --> 17:14.967
You've almost eaten
the entire thing.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.533
- Billie,
what are you doing?

17:19.400 --> 17:22.067
- I thought you put a bomb
in the turkey.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.833
You thought I was gonna, what?

17:24.933 --> 17:28.500
Kill all these people
and blow up my own house?

17:28.600 --> 17:30.067
- 'Cause you said--

17:30.133 --> 17:32.867
you said the turkey's
gonna be "da bomb."

17:32.967 --> 17:36.300
- It's an expression
from the '90s.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.633
I snuck in Joy
to do the cooking tonight.

17:38.733 --> 17:40.900
I figured, dad,
if you tasted her food

17:41.067 --> 17:43.500
maybe you'd remember
why we love her so much.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.867
- Aww.
- I know, I'm a sweetheart.

17:45.967 --> 17:49.933
- Pretty much.

17:55.267 --> 17:57.167
Crying?

17:57.267 --> 17:58.900
Or is that a cat
trying to breath in outer space?

17:59.067 --> 18:01.133
- Or like a ghost that's
trying too hard to be spooky?

18:01.233 --> 18:03.967
- We get it!
We all get it!

18:04.067 --> 18:06.067
- Look, I am sorry,
but I am not

18:06.167 --> 18:08.133
changing my mind
on this one.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.867
- I'll make you an offer,
Joy.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.367
I've sat here.
I've eaten your appetizers.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.700
And guess what?
I like what I taste.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.367
How'd you like
to come work for me?

18:18.467 --> 18:21.267
I'll give you 10% more
than you were making here.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.600
- Well, of course--
- Not so fast.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.067
I'm in love...

18:26.100 --> 18:27.533
and her name is Joy.

18:27.633 --> 18:29.333
I want to add you
to my portfolio

18:29.433 --> 18:32.133
of home care professionals.
20% raise...

18:32.233 --> 18:33.967
and three nights a week off.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.633
- Yeah, I'm sure she'll love

18:35.733 --> 18:36.967
cleaning up
after your three toddlers

18:37.067 --> 18:38.267
and two mistresses, Charles.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.100
- Leave Susan and Bunny out.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.533
This is business.

18:42.633 --> 18:44.867
Join the Spielvogel clan, Joy.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.100
What do you say?

18:52.867 --> 18:54.800
- Both offers are great,
but--

18:54.900 --> 18:56.600
- Let me sweeten the pot.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.100
I'm all-in
on the Joy business.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.333
I'll give you 30%
more than you're making now,

19:02.433 --> 19:07.067
plus first right of refusal
on all leftovers.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.600
- Sasaki goes through staff
like they're paper towels.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.400
- All the offers
are on the table.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.667
What's your decision?

19:15.767 --> 19:17.700
- Can we have a moment
to step outside

19:17.800 --> 19:18.867
to think about our decision?
- C-can we just work out--

19:18.967 --> 19:20.367
- Wait!

19:20.467 --> 19:22.600
- I want back in.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.500
Joy,
I will double your pay.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.067
That's 100% raise,
but more than money,

19:29.167 --> 19:32.233
I'll throw in something
you really deserve:

19:32.333 --> 19:34.667
an apology.

19:34.767 --> 19:37.900
I'm sorry, Joy.
I never should have let you go.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.267
I made a mistake.
Please come back.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.733
*

19:41.833 --> 19:45.367
- Mr. Russell...

19:45.467 --> 19:48.767
you've got a deal.
- Yes!

19:48.867 --> 19:51.200
- Nobody out "Shark Tanks"
Kent Russell.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.067
- We've got our Joy back.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.833
Oh, Billie.
- Ew.

19:54.933 --> 19:56.433
- Oh, did you--

19:56.533 --> 20:00.700
I ate it all.
I ate the meat.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.167
- I ate the guts!
- Ew.

20:04.267 --> 20:06.567
- I ate it's ass!
- Ugh.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.400
- Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.067
- I love you so much.

20:10.167 --> 20:15.833
Don't touch me.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.233
- Well, the last few days
have been crazy.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.767
- It got nutty.

20:18.867 --> 20:21.000
- You thought I was gonna
murder my entire family.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.200
- That's what happens
when your body

20:22.300 --> 20:23.533
starts eating
its own tissue.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.833
- I learned a lot, though.

20:27.933 --> 20:29.500
- Mm-hmm.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.567
I learned that you really
can send a message

20:31.667 --> 20:33.233
with your actions.
- Mm.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.500
- I learned that
if you want to fight

20:34.600 --> 20:35.733
for the little guy,
you become--

20:40.933 --> 20:42.600
- Right.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.600
I forgot to untie Hope.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.800
I tied her up
in the panic room.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.167
What do you think
JFK's doing right now?

20:53.267 --> 20:55.400
I don't want
to talk about it.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.633
- I'm doing
the hunger strike, too.

21:11.733 --> 21:13.333
- You've eaten so much.
You had five steaks.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.733
- Oh, my gosh!

21:14.833 --> 21:16.267
You're being
so dramatic right now!

21:16.367 --> 21:19.067
- You spit in my nostril!

21:19.133 --> 21:21.200
- I'll do it again...

21:21.300 --> 21:22.500
'cause you're being an A-hole.
That's what you're being.
