VICTOR'S AFTER MORE
THAN THE MISSING BELL.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.935
- DO YOU THINK IT WAS HIM
WHO PLANTED IT IN FABIAN'S ROOM?

12:08.018 --> 12:11.230
- I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER SUSPECTS AS OF NOW.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.650
- WHERE'S PATRICIA?

12:14.733 --> 12:16.652
[bell rings]

12:16.735 --> 12:18.696
- HEY, GUYS, OVER HERE.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.780
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:19.864 --> 12:22.116
- I HAD TO GET CHANGED,
REMEMBER?

12:22.199 --> 12:22.658
CHECK IT OUT.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.743
100% VOMIT-FREE.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.495
- SO WHERE'S THE COWBELL?

12:29.748 --> 12:31.083
- JASPER WAS IN THE LIBRARY.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.003
WE NEED TO THINK OF A WAY
TO GET THE BELL BACK.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.422
- YOU MEAN LIKE STEALING
BUT IN REVERSE.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.967
- A RE-HEIST.

12:40.050 --> 12:40.843
LET'S GO.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.763
[both speaking indistinctly]

12:54.148 --> 12:55.191
- SHOWTIME.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.108
- [clears throat]

12:56.192 --> 12:56.734
- JASPER.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.569
HOW HEAVY IS THIS?

12:58.652 --> 12:59.778
- ALFIE, NO.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.821
- OH, OOH.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.573
DECEPTIVELY HEAVY, OH.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.699
- DON'T LET IT GO.

13:03.782 --> 13:04.700
- I SHOULD LET IT GO?

13:04.783 --> 13:06.952
- I SAID, "DON'T LET IT GO."

13:08.746 --> 13:08.787
- OKAY. NOW. GO.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.168
- OOH, I'LL JUST
PUT IT BACK OVER HERE.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.544
- NO--
- I'M REALLY--

13:15.628 --> 13:16.962
- GIVE HIM TO ME.
- IT'S DELICATE, OKAY.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.381
I GOT IT.
- DON'T DARE LET IT GO.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.467
- I'LL TAKE THAT.
THANK YOU.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.510
- QUICK.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.427
FASTER.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.678
- PLEASE PUT IT DOWN.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.013
ALFIE, ALFIE--

13:26.096 --> 13:27.056
- OKAY.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.225
- NO--OH.
- J-J-JUST--

13:29.308 --> 13:29.808
- GO.
GO. GO. GO.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.148
- AH, I REALLY GOT IT NOW.
- MOVE IT NOW. READY?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.566
GO.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.530
[sighs]

13:42.613 --> 13:45.950
WHILE IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE
SUCH THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE,

13:46.033 --> 13:49.119
DON'T YOU ALL HAVE A CLASS
YOU COULD GO TO?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.538
- ALFIE.

13:50.621 --> 13:50.829
- YEAH.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.708
- OKAY, NOW WE CAN
GO BACK DOWN TO THE TUNNEL.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.127
PATRICIA AND AMBER,
YOU KEEP WATCH.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.546
WE'LL HEAD DOWN.
- OKAY.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.895
- [sighs]
COME ON.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.446
- HORUS, GOD OF THE SKIES.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.864
- LOOK AT THESE HANDS.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.456
- THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE MEANT
TO BE HOLDING SOMETHING.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.958
- WHAT, THOUGH?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.466
- WHEN DID YOU NOTICE IT?

14:44.550 --> 14:45.467
- LESS THAN TEN MINUTES AGO.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.846
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IT GOT THERE.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.140
STILL, NOW IT'S BACK,
WE CAN DRAW A LINE

14:51.223 --> 14:53.309
UNDER THAT WHOLE BUSINESS,
CAN'T WE?

14:54.852 --> 14:59.565
- WASN'T THE CHAIN LONGER?

15:04.486 --> 15:06.822
- PATRICIA.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.657
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.701
THERE'S THIS WEIRD LADY
WHO GRABS KIDS

15:10.784 --> 15:12.578
AND DRAGS THEM OFF
TO HAVE THEIR BAGS SEARCHED.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.829
I THINK SHE'S STALKING ME,

15:13.912 --> 15:17.583
SO, YOU KNOW,
YOU BETTER HIDE ME.

15:17.666 --> 15:18.626
- WHAT?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.961
BUT THERE'S TWO OF YOU,
PATRICIA.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.087
WAIT.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.422
WE'RE NOT BEING CURSED AGAIN,
ARE WE?

15:23.505 --> 15:24.089
- NOPE.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.217
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:27.301 --> 15:29.803
- WAIT.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.555
ARE YOU TWO TWINS?

15:31.639 --> 15:34.350
- OKAY, YOU MUST BE AMBER.

15:34.433 --> 15:34.933
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.352
[door clicks]

15:38.354 --> 15:39.563
- WHOA.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.067
- PIPER.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.777
- YOU HAVE A TWIN?

15:44.860 --> 15:45.819
- YEP,

15:45.903 --> 15:47.946
A TWIN WITH SOME EXPLAINING
TO DO.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.454
- QUITE SIMPLY,
KEEP YOUR NOSE OUT OF THINGS

15:55.537 --> 15:58.123
THAT DO NOT CONCERN YOU.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.541
- BUT IF THE COLLECTOR
HAD SOMETHING TO DO

15:59.625 --> 16:02.461
WITH THE THEFT OF THE BELL,
I SHOULD'VE BEEN TOLD.

16:02.544 --> 16:03.754
- JASPER, YOU OVERESTIMATE
YOUR IMPORTANCE.

16:03.837 --> 16:07.341
THIS WORKS
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

16:08.759 --> 16:09.677
TRUDY.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.553
- VERA.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.059
YOU AND VERA WERE TALKING
FOR A LONG TIME.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.394
- UH, YES.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.605
VERA HAS A THEORY
THAT THE THIEF'S GUILT

16:21.689 --> 16:24.566
COMPELLED HIM TO RETURN IT.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.194
- INTERESTING.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.948
MAYBE.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.616
I NOTICED SHE HAD
A CUT ON HER ARM.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.077
NOTHING SERIOUS, I HOPE.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.163
- UH, A SIMPLE KITCHEN INJURY.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.081
WHY?

16:42.209 --> 16:46.588
- I FOUND THIS
ON THE NIGHT OF THE THEFT.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.340
IT HAS BLOOD ON IT,

16:48.424 --> 16:50.884
WHICH MEANS
THAT WHOEVER STOLE THE OX BELL

16:50.968 --> 16:51.927
CUT THEMSELVES
ON THE BROKEN GLASS.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.388
- VERA'S CUT IS A COINCIDENCE.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.099
THE BELL HAS BEEN RETURNED,
SO LET'S JUST LEAVE IT HERE

16:57.182 --> 16:59.351
AND NOT INVENT
CONSPIRACY THEORIES,

16:59.435 --> 17:00.811
PLEASE, TRUDY.

17:07.818 --> 17:08.861
- GUYS.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.945
CHECK THIS OUT.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.239
- IT'S A RIDDLE.

17:12.321 --> 17:15.951
- "ON SIX LITTLE STARS
THAT BORROW LIGHT,

17:16.034 --> 17:20.122
"A SECRET FALCON
TAKES ITS FLIGHT.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.040
"SEEK THE STAR
IN THE JACKAL'S LAIR.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.795
"BE ALWAYS VIGILANT
AND BEWARE,

17:26.878 --> 17:29.965
"FOR THE QUESTER
THAT COMPLETES THIS TASK

17:30.048 --> 17:33.093
WILL FIND
THE CHAMBER OF THE MASK."

17:33.177 --> 17:35.429
YUP, THAT'S DEFINITELY A RIDDLE.

17:35.512 --> 17:38.223
- "ON SIX LITTLE STARS
THAT BORROW LIGHT,

17:38.307 --> 17:41.226
THE SECRET FALCON
TAKES ITS FLIGHT."

17:41.310 --> 17:43.479
- SO WE NEED TO MAKE
A CONSTELLATION SHAPE

17:43.562 --> 17:45.147
WITH SIX STARS
THAT BORROW LIGHT

17:45.230 --> 17:47.483
FROM THIS BEAM.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.693
- WELL, THERE ARE SIX STAFFS.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.904
- SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SIX OBJECTS TO PUT ON THEM.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.781
- AND THE SECRET FALCON--

17:53.864 --> 17:55.032
THAT MUST BE THE SECRET SYMBOL.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.742
- SO THINK.
WHAT BORROWS LIGHT?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.536
- SHINY THINGS REFLECT LIGHT.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.455
- YES.
ALFIE, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.456
- HMM.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.832
- YES.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.501
- WAIT.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.960
NINA, DON'T.
- NO! SEVEN YEARS' BAD LUCK.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.088
- GUYS, I'M ALREADY CURSED
ANYWAY.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.173
- BUT--
- COME ON.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.466
HELP ME PUT THESE
ON THE BEAMS.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.343
- CAREFUL, NINA.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.519
- [sighs]
SO I GUESS MIRRORS DON'T WORK.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.020
- GREAT.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.730
- WE NEED TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE
TO BEND THE BEAMS.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.731
- WAIT.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.358
"THE QUESTER
WHO COMPLETES THIS TASK

18:29.441 --> 18:33.779
WILL FIND
THE CHAMBER OF THE MASK."

18:33.862 --> 18:35.197
ARE YOU GUYS THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.033
- THIS COULD BE
THE LAST TASK, GUYS.

18:38.116 --> 18:41.537
THAT MIGHT BE THE LAST TUNNEL
WE EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.621
- AMAZEBALLS.
- [laughing]

18:42.704 --> 18:43.705
- I FEEL A RESEARCH SESSION
COMING ON.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.666
LET'S GO.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.132
- YOU'VE DONE WELL TO PROGRESS
THIS FAR, CHOSEN ONE,

18:54.216 --> 18:58.720
AND I TRUST YOU HAVE
LEARNED YOUR LESSON WELL.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.139
DO NOT EVER DISOBEY ME.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.145
- NINA.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.063
COME ON.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.815
- YEAH.
COMING.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.832
- SHOOT.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.042
- I DITCHED A TRIP TO EUROPE.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.253
THE SCHOOL THINKS
I WENT HOME ILL.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.005
MUM AND DAD THINK
I'M IN MILAN FOR MUSIC WEEK.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.799
- NO ONE WOULD DITCH
A TRIP TO MILAN.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.010
IT'S EVERY FASHIONISTA'S
SPIRITUAL HOME.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.261
- MILAN'S OKAY.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.388
IT'S MY SCHOOL
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.432
- OH, THE SPECIAL MUSIC ACADEMY

19:43.515 --> 19:46.435
FOR SPECIAL MUSIC GENIUSES?

19:46.518 --> 19:49.605
YEAH, THAT MUST BE ROUGH.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.231
SO WHAT?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.609
YOU WANTED TO COME AND SEE
WHAT SCHOOL FOR MUGGLES IS LIKE?

19:53.692 --> 19:57.487
- ACTUALLY, I MISSED YOU, TRIX.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.822
- THIS IS REALLY TOUCHING
AND ALL,

19:58.906 --> 20:01.825
BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA HIDE YOU
FROM VICTOR?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.953
- WELL, SO LONG AS NO ONE
SEES THEM TOGETHER,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.163
IT SHOULD BE FINE.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.706
I'M IN FAVOR.

20:08.749 --> 20:12.419
- OKAY, FINE.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.546
- SERIOUSLY?
MILAN?

20:14.630 --> 20:15.505
WHAT A WASTE.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.258
OH, IN FAVOR, DEFINITELY.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.012
- [sighs]

20:22.095 --> 20:23.805
OKAY, WE NEED
TO KEEP THIS A SECRET,

20:23.889 --> 20:25.390
JUST BETWEEN US.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.017
'CAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE
THAT FIND OUT,

20:27.100 --> 20:28.977
THE MORE CHANCE VICTOR WILL TOO.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.813
AND THEN WE'RE TOAST.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.231
AGREED?

20:35.734 --> 20:36.777
- THIS MIGHT BE FUN.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.704
- A PERFECT MATCH.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.503
[door clicks]

20:54.586 --> 20:56.755
- WHY EXACTLY ARE YOU
GOING THROUGH MY THINGS?

20:59.007 --> 21:01.760
- IT'S FROM THE OX BELL,

21:01.843 --> 21:03.011
WHICH YOU STOLE.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.012
- UGH.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.306
OH, COME NOW, TRUDY.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.849
I REALIZE THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT

21:07.933 --> 21:09.226
OF HEALTHY RIVALRY BETWEEN US--

21:09.309 --> 21:12.187
- YOU'RE NOT TALKING YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.438
I'M REPORTING YOU TO MR. SWEET.

21:15.565 --> 21:20.404
- I'LL SAY YOU PLANTED THE CHAIN
IN MY ROOM.

21:20.487 --> 21:20.862
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.991
- NO?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.702
THEN WHAT'S THIS?

21:26.785 --> 21:28.870
I FOUND IT

21:28.954 --> 21:30.664
AT THE VERY SCENE
OF THE CRIME.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.083
GO ON.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.585
EXPLAIN THAT.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.796
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.224
- ON THE CONTRARY, TRUDY.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.518
I DON'T SEE
HOW <i> YOU'RE</i> GETTING OUT.
