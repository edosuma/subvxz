You know, like the wheels

Oh, hi.
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.133
Today I'm cleaning
out the storage room

01:26.200 --> 01:28.200
here at the bike shop.

01:28.266 --> 01:29.367
Oh, hi, Oscar.

01:29.433 --> 01:33.066
Yeah, yeah.
Hi. Whatever.

01:33.133 --> 01:34.734
What is this?

01:34.800 --> 01:37.233
Heh.
This junk's amazing.

01:37.300 --> 01:40.066
Well, if you see anything
you like, take it, please.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.166
I'm still trying
to figure out

01:41.233 --> 01:42.767
how I'm gonna get rid
of all this stuff.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.367
Heh heh.
This will fit perfectly

01:44.433 --> 01:45.567
in my collection.

01:45.633 --> 01:46.800
Oh, really?
You collect wheels?

01:46.867 --> 01:48.166
No! Trash!

01:48.233 --> 01:49.900
I'll take it all.
Heh heh heh.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.266
Oh, really?
All of it?

01:51.333 --> 01:52.266
Yeah, yeah.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.266
That's terrific,
Oscar.

01:53.333 --> 01:54.433
Thank you. Gracias.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.667
You're doing me
a big favor.

01:55.734 --> 01:57.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't mention it.

01:57.266 --> 01:59.500
Have it all delivered
to my trash can.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.300
Pronto!

02:01.367 --> 02:04.433
Oh, so you're not
gonna, uh...

02:05.767 --> 02:08.266
OK.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.200
Looks like I'm gonna
need some help.

02:10.266 --> 02:11.867
Better call some movers.

02:11.934 --> 02:14.166
Hello

02:14.233 --> 02:15.867
Yeah, I'm gonna
need something moved
right away.

02:15.934 --> 02:18.333
Did somebody call
for movers?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.734
- That was fast.
- Oh, yes, siree.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.033
Near or far, big or small,

02:23.100 --> 02:26.166
you need three pigs
to move it all.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.767
Oink!

02:27.834 --> 02:30.533
Wow. Well, uh,
this is a big job.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.533
You're probably going
to need all three pigs
for this one.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.400
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
Definitely. Yeah.

02:34.467 --> 02:37.367
That's why all three
of us are here, ready to--

02:37.433 --> 02:40.500
Oh, excuse me.
Hey, piggies!

02:40.567 --> 02:42.900
This is the place!

02:42.967 --> 02:44.667
Sheep: Yahoo!

02:44.734 --> 02:47.500
Whew! Cochinita dos.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.100
Oh, yeah,
that's Pig Number Two.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.367
Uh, where's
Pig Number Three?

02:52.433 --> 02:54.867
- Me here.
- Ah!

02:54.934 --> 02:57.033
Wait a minute.
I count one monster,

02:57.100 --> 03:00.233
one sheep, and one pig,
not three pigs.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.734
Oh, well, Three Pigs Movers
has had a lot of work lately,

03:02.800 --> 03:03.934
and we needed
extra help,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.300
but we were running low
on pigs,

03:05.367 --> 03:08.367
so she won our
Pig For A Day contest...

03:08.433 --> 03:09.800
Cochinita por un dia.

03:09.867 --> 03:12.467
...and I promised
the furry guy a cookie.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.433
- Pig for a day.
- Huh.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.533
Congratulations?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.533
- Oink you.
- Hee hee hee!

03:18.600 --> 03:20.767
OK, well, I'm gonna
need all of this stuff

03:20.834 --> 03:24.967
moved from here
to that garbage can
in front of 123.

03:28.900 --> 03:29.967
Ha ha ha.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.800
Oh, boy, that far.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.867
Whoa, this a big job.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.600
Oh, it's no problem.

03:39.667 --> 03:44.133
The Three Pigs Movers
are ready, willing,
and pigs.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.433
Oink!

03:45.500 --> 03:47.400
Thank you. Gracias.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.867
OK, I'm gonna be doing
some restocking.

03:49.934 --> 03:52.367
Just let me know
if you need anything.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.633
All right.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.400
OK, pigs,
let's move it!

03:57.467 --> 04:00.500
OK! Yahoo!

04:00.567 --> 04:02.834
Yeah, maybe you
should just walk,
Pig Number Two.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.200
Hiya! Oh!

04:04.266 --> 04:06.000
Oh! Oh,
Pig Number Three,
hang on.

04:06.066 --> 04:08.533
Please don't try to lift
that whole pile by yourself.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.266
It OK.
Me using me legs.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.667
Yeah. No, but see,
that pile is too heavy

04:12.734 --> 04:14.100
to move all at once,

04:14.166 --> 04:18.400
but not if you move
one piece at a time,
huh?

04:18.467 --> 04:21.266
Whoa! You some kind
of piggy genius.

04:21.333 --> 04:24.100
Oh, thank you.
OK, everybody pick

04:24.166 --> 04:26.166
just one thing
to carry, all right?

04:26.233 --> 04:28.867
- Si! Si!
- OK. Oh, me got this.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.066
- Me got this one.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.266
Oh, boy,

04:32.333 --> 04:33.767
Pig: Oh, let me help you,
Pig Number Three.

04:33.834 --> 04:35.066
- Oh, yeah. OK.
- Let me get up in there.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.066
Pig:
You got it?

04:36.133 --> 04:37.066
Oh, yeah, me got it.
You got it?

04:37.133 --> 04:38.333
Pig:
Yeah, I got it. Wait, oh--

04:38.400 --> 04:40.233
Whoa!
This really heavy.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.266
Pig:
Oh, you still got it?

04:41.333 --> 04:42.734
No, me no got it.
You got it?

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
Pig:
No, I don't got it.

04:43.867 --> 04:44.800
- No one got it.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.333
- Ahh!

04:46.400 --> 04:47.467
Hee hee hee.

04:47.533 --> 04:50.066
I heard a crash.
Is everyone OK?

04:50.133 --> 04:52.567
- Pig: We're professionals.
- Yep. Ohh.

04:52.633 --> 04:56.367
You know,
some of these things
are too heavy to move.

04:56.433 --> 04:57.734
Well, can I show you
how you can move

04:57.800 --> 04:59.066
heavy things by yourself?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.967
Move heavy things
by me self?

05:02.033 --> 05:03.900
Well, that hard
to believe.

05:03.967 --> 05:06.600
Well, see how I can
move all of these heavy boxes

05:06.667 --> 05:08.333
with my hand truck?

05:08.400 --> 05:09.934
It's easy to move,
and that's because

05:10.000 --> 05:12.166
there are wheels
on the bottom. See?

05:12.233 --> 05:15.166
- Pig: Ohh.
- Ohh. Ah-ha.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.033
Me see.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.533
No wonder you trashed
this one.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.533
This one got wheels
on top.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.767
Yes, not bottom.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.300
This defective cart.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.133
Well, hang on.
Let me show you.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.734
I'll help you flip it over.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.200
Ready? One, two, three.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.734
I got it. Ohh.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.734
Whoa. See?
Wheels are round.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.633
They roll.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.934
Wheels are a great tool
for moving heavy things.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.867
Wow, that pretty
slick technology.

05:44.934 --> 05:46.767
Pig:
Oh, hey, and look.

05:46.834 --> 05:50.400
Wheels come in a lot
of different sizes.

05:50.467 --> 05:53.467
Ooh, hey.
And they round

05:53.533 --> 05:55.667
like a cookie.

05:55.734 --> 05:59.133
Om nom nom nom nom!

05:59.200 --> 06:00.633
OK, that not
taste very good,

06:00.700 --> 06:02.600
but you know what?
It not bad, either.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.166
Om nom nom nom nom!

06:04.233 --> 06:06.033
Uh, big lady,

06:06.100 --> 06:08.934
uh, how many wheels does
something need to roll?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.300
Well, it depends.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.166
Different things
have different numbers
of wheels.

06:13.233 --> 06:14.266
Pig:
Oh, really?

06:14.333 --> 06:18.500
Yeah, like a bicycle
has one, two wheels.

06:18.567 --> 06:19.567
- Pig: Oh, do tell.
- Yeah.

06:19.633 --> 06:23.200
A tricycle has one,
two, three wheels.

06:23.266 --> 06:27.533
Oh, so the cart has one,
two, three, four wheels.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.066
Four wheels altogether.

06:29.133 --> 06:32.000
Aw, thanks, lady.
OK, we're ready to roll.

06:32.066 --> 06:33.300
I'm gonna get back
to work.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.967
Oh, boy.
This job will be easy now

06:36.033 --> 06:38.200
that we have wheels to help
move this heavy stuff.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.367
Yes-- Wait a minute.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.200
- Me got brainstorm.

06:42.266 --> 06:45.467
What if we put stuff
in shopping cart?

06:45.533 --> 06:48.066
That make it easy
to move it all at once.

06:48.133 --> 06:51.433
Oh, that's a great idea,
Pig Number Three.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.100
Yeah. Well, you know,
me learn that

06:53.166 --> 06:54.700
when me go shopping
with me mommy.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.066
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.433
Hey, I'm waiting
for that junk.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.967
You three want
to quit yapping

07:00.033 --> 07:02.400
and start
with the moving already?

07:02.467 --> 07:03.934
Pig: No problem.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.266
Ok, piggies, you heard
the unkempt green customer.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.100
- Si.
- Let's roll!

07:09.166 --> 07:10.100
- Si.
- Yes, let's do it.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.266
Pig:

Oh, esta no tiene ruedas.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.600
Oh, yeah, you're right.
No wheels.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.200

What can we do?

07:47.100 --> 07:52.100
Podemos poner las ruedas
en las cosas pesadas.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.300
Put wheels
on the heavy things?

07:54.367 --> 07:56.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Great idea, Pig Number Two.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.533

He investigates.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.500

Aah!

Super Grover 2.0!

12:37.567 --> 12:40.400
He shows up!

12:43.600 --> 12:47.834
In a world covered with ice
and snow, one piece of ice

12:47.900 --> 12:51.266
is about to change these
penguins' lives forever.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.066
All right, penguins.

- Aah!

13:00.767 --> 13:02.133
What's going on?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.734
This giant block of ice
is right in the middle

13:03.800 --> 13:05.400
of our dance floor!

13:05.467 --> 13:07.133
Waah.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.600
Hmm? What's with
the strange music?

13:12.567 --> 13:14.433
What's with the strange car?

13:15.834 --> 13:18.200
What's with
the strange dude?

13:18.266 --> 13:20.800
I am not just
any strange dude.

13:20.867 --> 13:24.033
I am a super-strange dude,

13:24.100 --> 13:28.567
for I am Super Grover 2.0!

13:28.633 --> 13:30.100
Penguins: Ooh!

13:30.166 --> 13:31.600
What seems
to be the problem?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.333
- Well--
- Wait! Do not tell me,

13:33.400 --> 13:38.633
for I will unleash
my powers of observation!

13:38.700 --> 13:40.133
Ooh.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.967
Um, I cannot
observe a thing

13:44.033 --> 13:45.867
with this giant block
of ice in the way.

13:45.934 --> 13:48.000
The giant ice block
is the problem.

13:48.066 --> 13:49.400
It is?

13:49.467 --> 13:52.266
Yeah. We can't do
our penguin dance routine

13:52.333 --> 13:55.800
because this giant block
of ice is on our dance floor.

13:55.867 --> 14:00.533
Oh. Do not worry, my wee
waddling compadres, for I,

14:00.600 --> 14:04.633
Super Grover 2.0, will unleash

14:04.700 --> 14:07.500
my power of investigation.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.500
What's
he going to do?

14:11.567 --> 14:14.600
I wonder what would happen
if I tickled the ice.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.967
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.133
Coochy-coochy-coo.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.133
I wonder what
would happen

14:18.200 --> 14:19.133
if you gave it
a push.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.033
- Wait a minute!

14:21.100 --> 14:25.033
I wonder what would happen
if I gave it a push.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.600
That's what I said.

14:26.667 --> 14:31.567
Behold as I investigate
with a push!

14:31.633 --> 14:33.367
Penguins: Ooh!

14:37.467 --> 14:40.433
Eh, it's really
not moving much.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.934
This giant block of ice
appears to be very big

14:44.000 --> 14:45.367
and heavy.

14:45.433 --> 14:46.867
Penguins: Ohh.

14:46.934 --> 14:49.533
Have no fear,
little penguins.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.467
I shall just use
a little more force.

14:52.533 --> 14:54.133
Penguins: Ooh!

14:54.200 --> 14:57.567
Hiyah-- Ooh! Ow.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.066
Penguins: Ohh.

14:59.133 --> 15:02.867
Who knew investigating
could be so painful?

15:02.934 --> 15:04.200
Ouch.

15:04.266 --> 15:07.200
We'll never
dance again.

15:07.266 --> 15:08.567
Penguins: Waah.

15:08.633 --> 15:11.667
I am not giving up yet,
my tuxedoed amigos.

15:11.734 --> 15:17.166
It is time to unleash
the power of technology!

15:17.233 --> 15:18.667
Penguins: Waah?

15:18.734 --> 15:20.467
I'm going to go get
some tools to help me

15:20.533 --> 15:22.800
move the block of ice.

15:22.867 --> 15:24.166
- Hey.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.133
Check out
the Super Grovermobile.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.467
What about it?

15:27.533 --> 15:28.667
It's big and heavy

15:28.734 --> 15:31.367
like the block of ice,
but it moves.

15:31.433 --> 15:34.100
Hey, yeah. Yeah,
but what makes it

15:34.166 --> 15:36.133
move so easily?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.433
Penguins: Wheels!

15:41.500 --> 15:43.166
OK. I am back now.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.567
Super Grover, maybe
you should try wheels.

15:46.633 --> 15:50.700
Nonsense. You cannot hit
a block of ice with wheels

15:50.767 --> 15:53.400
to move it,
but you can hit it

15:53.467 --> 15:57.300
with a sturdy,
metal golf club.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.367
Penguin: What? Oh, boy.

15:59.433 --> 16:01.767
Fore!

16:01.834 --> 16:04.433
Ayy!

16:06.900 --> 16:09.333
Hiyah!

16:09.400 --> 16:12.500
I wonder if we could
move the ice out of the way

16:12.567 --> 16:14.266
if it had wheels.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.734
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.800
Come on, birds!

16:17.867 --> 16:19.166
Everybody grab a wheel!

16:19.233 --> 16:20.834
Penguins:
Wheel, wheel, wheel.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.567
Ta-da! Rah!

16:26.300 --> 16:28.400
Sis-boom-bah.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.300
Blah, blah, blah.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.600
Penguins:
OK. Come on. You got it?

16:32.667 --> 16:33.900
- I got it.
- OK, here we go.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.433
What are you
penguins doing?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.600
We're using the power
of technology.

16:38.667 --> 16:39.800
Huh?

16:39.867 --> 16:42.100
Oh, yeah. Can we borrow
this technology?

16:42.166 --> 16:44.667
- Thanks.
- Wha--

16:47.166 --> 16:48.467
OK. OK. OK.

16:48.533 --> 16:49.934
All right.
I got it, I got it.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.800
Yep, yep, yep. Ahh.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.133
Aah!

16:58.734 --> 17:00.000
Mm-hmm.

17:01.633 --> 17:02.700
All right, penguins.

17:02.767 --> 17:05.734
Now let's try moving
this block of ice.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.867
Do not be silly.

17:07.934 --> 17:11.600
If a super guy like me
cannot move that block of ice,

17:11.667 --> 17:14.200
there is no way four
little penguins can do it.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.233
Ha!

17:17.700 --> 17:19.066
Wha--

17:19.133 --> 17:21.400
The little penguins
are moving it?

17:21.467 --> 17:25.333
How are you moving
that giant piece of ice?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.767
All:
Wheels!

17:26.834 --> 17:28.000
Now come on,
penguins!

17:42.734 --> 17:43.667
Um.

17:45.033 --> 17:46.900
The Super Grovermobile
is not moving.

Why is the Super Grovermobile
not moving

17:53.467 --> 17:55.934
Announcer: And so our
intrepid hero has discovered

17:56.000 --> 17:58.867
that if wheels can help move
the Super Grovermobile,

17:58.934 --> 18:01.734
they can make it easier

20:31.800 --> 20:34.100
Welcome to Elmo's World!

20:34.166 --> 20:38.533
Oh, guess what
Elmo is wondering
about today.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.433
Wait for it...

20:40.500 --> 20:43.467
Wai-ait for it!

20:43.533 --> 20:45.266
Oh, ho ho ho!

20:45.333 --> 20:46.700
Wheels.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.233
Whoa.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.934
Wow.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.300
Oh, Elmo thinks
that wheels are cool,

20:53.367 --> 20:55.934
and wants to learn more
about them.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.934
Hey, let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.800
Let's call her together.

21:01.867 --> 21:04.934
Elmo and kids:
Oh, Smartie!

21:06.800 --> 21:08.867
Look! I'm on a roll.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.300
Whee!

21:10.367 --> 21:13.166
- Whoa-ha-ha!
- Hiya, Elmo.

21:13.233 --> 21:16.533
Elmo wants to learn all
about wheels, Smartie.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.467
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:19.533 --> 21:22.367
All:
We look it up!

21:22.433 --> 21:24.800
Searching
for info on wheels.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.166
Here we go.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.867
There's so many
different kinds
of wheels.

21:29.934 --> 21:33.333
There are wheels
that help us to get around

21:33.400 --> 21:35.734
and wheels that help us
to move heavy things.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.066
Wheels come in different sizes.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.066
Some are big

21:42.133 --> 21:44.100
and some are small.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.767
Some things use lots
of wheels--

21:46.834 --> 21:50.900
Four wheels, three wheels,
two wheels,

21:50.967 --> 21:54.100
but sometimes
one wheel is all you need.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.400
Yeah, Smartie.
There's so many

21:56.467 --> 21:58.300
different kinds
of wheels.

21:58.367 --> 21:59.967
There sure are.
Later, Elmo.

22:00.033 --> 22:02.233
Whoa.
Later, Smartie.

22:02.300 --> 22:06.200
Ha ha ha!
Boy, wheels are so great.

22:06.266 --> 22:09.967
Hey, that gives Elmo an idea.

22:10.033 --> 22:12.500
Oh, come on,
let's play a game together.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.367
Yeah. Come on, come on.

22:19.567 --> 22:23.967
Elmo wonders if we could
put all the wheels in order

22:24.033 --> 22:26.233
from biggest to smallest.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.633
Are you ready?

22:27.700 --> 22:29.100
Let's play.

22:29.166 --> 22:33.367
OK, first we need to start
with the biggest wheel.

22:33.433 --> 22:36.333
Which one of these
is the biggest?

22:36.400 --> 22:38.667
Kid: That one,
the cart wheel.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.200
The one made of wood.

22:40.266 --> 22:43.667
The cart wheel?
Let's try it.

22:43.734 --> 22:46.900
Yeah, that's
the biggest wheel.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.433
Oh, and which wheel
comes next?

22:49.500 --> 22:50.900
This one?

22:50.967 --> 22:51.967
Kids: No!

22:52.033 --> 22:53.867
Girl: Not that one.

22:53.934 --> 22:56.367
Ah, ha ha ha,
you're right.

22:56.433 --> 22:58.834
It must be this one.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.567
- Kids: Yeah.
- Boy: The bicycle wheel.

23:01.633 --> 23:05.367
That means the wagon wheel
is the smallest.

23:05.433 --> 23:07.400
Kids: Yeah!

23:07.467 --> 23:10.033
That was "wheel-y" great.
Ha ha ha!

23:10.100 --> 23:12.133
You get it?
Wheel

23:12.200 --> 23:16.500
Boy, that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:16.567 --> 23:19.734
Oh, does Mr. Noodle
use wheels?

23:19.800 --> 23:21.066
Oh, let's ask him.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.834
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:23.900 --> 23:26.934
Oh! It's Mr. Noodle's sister,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.633
Ms. Noodle.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.700
Kids and Elmo:
Hi, Ms. Noodle!

23:30.767 --> 23:33.233
Oh, Ms. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering,

23:33.300 --> 23:35.200
do you use wheels?

23:35.266 --> 23:37.000
Elmo: You do?

23:37.066 --> 23:40.100
Oh, show us how
you use wheels, Ms. Noodle.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.900
OK, Ms. Noodle's
gonna use wheels

23:42.967 --> 23:46.300
to move her wagon.

23:46.367 --> 23:48.467
Wait a minute, there's
no wheels on your wagon.

23:48.533 --> 23:50.266
What are you gonna do?

23:50.333 --> 23:53.300
Oh, she's got it.
She's got it.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.967
Girl:
Wait, you can't use those.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.133
Elmo:
No, you can't use those.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.066
Wheels have to be round,
remember?

24:03.100 --> 24:05.533
Girl:
Yeah, round wheels.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.266
Those are the right shape.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.100
Elmo: Now Ms. Noodle
can use the wheels

24:09.166 --> 24:10.834
to move her wagon.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.867
Boy:
No, that won't work.

24:12.934 --> 24:14.266
That's not how you use wheels.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.433
Elmo:
Try again, Ms. Noodle.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.600
Kid: She's putting them
on the wagon.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.367
Kid 2:
Yeah, that's right.

24:22.433 --> 24:24.867
Elmo:
That's it, Ms. Noodle.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.266
Yeah!

24:30.767 --> 24:33.000
Kid: She's using the wheels
the right way.

24:33.066 --> 24:34.367
She can pull her wagon.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.533
Elmo:
Great job, Ms. Noodle.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.700
Thank you for showing us
how to use wheels, Ms. Noodle.

24:39.767 --> 24:40.867
Bye-bye.

24:40.934 --> 24:44.934
