WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:09.968
[knocking]

00:10.427 --> 00:11.720
[door creaks open]

00:13.054 --> 00:16.641
Hi! Jen Harding. Real estate agent.

00:16.725 --> 00:21.730
I just sold a house in the area for
two million, all cash. Blah, blah, blah!

00:22.147 --> 00:25.734
Anyway, I just wanted you to know
how valuable your property is.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.445
I mean, especially with this curb appeal.

00:29.946 --> 00:30.780
[man] Oh.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.323
Well, I'm not looking to sell.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.410
Oh. Well, you might change your mind
if I do an appraisal,

00:35.493 --> 00:37.328
which should only take a few minutes.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.248
I mean, unless you're busy
or you just hate money.

00:41.624 --> 00:42.459
Well...

00:46.838 --> 00:48.298
[Judy] Is this ethical?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.341
Harassing people
because they're on a list?

00:50.842 --> 00:52.427
It's not unethical.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.054
We're not hurting anybody,

00:54.137 --> 00:56.222
just tracking down people
who own vintage Mustangs.

00:57.015 --> 01:01.728
Right. But, like, historically,
lists have been bad for people, right?

01:01.811 --> 01:03.521
-Like the blacklist.
-This list is only bad

01:03.605 --> 01:06.775
-for the person who killed Jen's husband.
-[laughs] Right. Yeah.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.985
And there have been some
good lists, historically.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.529
-Schindler's list. Great list.
-Yeah.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.033
It was really...That was a beautiful list.

01:15.158 --> 01:15.992
[Nick] Uh-huh.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.412
But is it legal, what we're doing?

01:21.081 --> 01:24.793
My buddy Dennis at the NCIC can share
information with government agencies.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.255
Now, would Laguna PD consider me
a government agency? Hell, no.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.632
[both laughing]

01:30.715 --> 01:34.302
-Come on. This is fun, right?
-Well, it is so fun.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.514
I haven't felt this good in months.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.224
Honestly.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.143
Being here with you, working a case.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.354
It's bringing me back to life.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.064
So, thank you.

01:47.899 --> 01:48.775
You're welcome.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.492
So, it's about 1,500 square feet?

01:57.575 --> 02:00.370
No idea.
I inherited the house from my aunt.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.164
-She's in a home now, so--
-Great. Can I see the garage?

02:04.165 --> 02:06.626
Oh! Is this a '66 Mustang?

02:07.127 --> 02:11.089
Yeah, but, um... the car
doesn't come with the house.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.174
You ever hit anybody with this thing?

02:15.426 --> 02:17.220
-[door slams]
-[tires screech]

02:17.303 --> 02:18.805
[engine revs]

02:22.016 --> 02:23.059
[Jen] Oh!

02:23.351 --> 02:24.269
Okay.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.439
Cross that one off the list.
He was on a <i>Star Trek</i> cruise that week.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.817
I saw so many pictures I wish I hadn't.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.444
All right. Six down. 242 to go.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.739
My God. I can't believe the fucker who did
this is one of these names on this list.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.950
God, it's gonna feel so good
to look him in the eye

02:39.033 --> 02:41.244
and tell him
what a spineless monster he is

02:41.327 --> 02:44.164
and then beat the shit out of him.
All right. Who's next?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.291
Okay. Beachside Antiques. Deerfield Road.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.417
Business? Weird.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.544
Yeah. Could be a company car, or rentals.

02:49.627 --> 02:53.256
Bunch of businesses on here.
Move Ur Car Ur Way, Pelican Vintage.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.134
-TKG Arts.
-Who the fuck is TKG Arts?

02:56.801 --> 02:59.804
-[shakily] Can I see that?
-Yeah. You all right?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.017
Yeah, it's just, like, stuffy in here.
Right?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.602
[engine starts]

03:07.353 --> 03:09.063
Okay. These businesses are all downtown.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.276
So why don't you guys drop me off
and then I'll check these out?

03:13.359 --> 03:14.986
-[Jen] Hmm.
-Safer if we stick together.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.779
[Jen] Yeah, right? All right.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.032
I need a name, Judy. Mama's on a roll.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.701
-Okay.
-Yup.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.953
Heather Dornan.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.164
Uh... She lives in Costa Mesa.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.459
Seven-two-eight Bristol Street.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.254
A woman. Wow.

03:33.796 --> 03:34.714
That surprise you?

03:35.089 --> 03:37.508
I just never pictured
a woman driving the car.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.760
What kind of feminist am I?

03:38.843 --> 03:41.512
[laughs] Oh, women can be murderers too.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.141
-I know. I saw that Charlize Theron movie.
-Which one?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.726
-Uh-huh!
-[Jen and Nick laugh]

03:47.060 --> 03:48.645
[sat-nav] <i>The route is being calculated.</i>

03:49.020 --> 03:50.980
Wait, you know what?
I need a bottle of water.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.565
-[Jen] Oh. Sure.
-Can you pop the trunk?

03:52.649 --> 03:53.483
Okay.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.194
-All right?
-[beep]

03:56.653 --> 03:58.988
God, there's just
so many names on this list.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.491
I wish that we could narrow it down
somehow and find this guy.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.534
-Or gal.
-Oh, right.

04:03.618 --> 04:04.994
-Mm-hm.
-God, I'm such a dick.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.246
-Yup.
-[laughter]

04:06.996 --> 04:07.997
[thump]

04:08.456 --> 04:09.499
What was that?

04:10.458 --> 04:11.417
Jude?

04:12.460 --> 04:13.294
Judy?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.214
Oh, come on. I'm fine.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.632
I faint all the time.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.008
No, you don't.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.386
Yeah. You haven't known me for that long.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
I did it a bunch in high school
and then once at Lilith Fair.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.266
Remember Lilith Fair?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.393
No, I was way too high.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.019
-Of course you were.
-[laughs]

04:30.186 --> 04:31.312
-It was fun.
-Okay.

04:31.562 --> 04:34.023
Nobody get too excited,
but Dennis just called.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.775
He crosschecked our list against DUIs.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.027
-And?
-Something interesting.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.573
Andrew Peters. Two DUIs.
Lives four blocks from the scene.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.825
Andrew Peters.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.160
-That's the fucking guy.
-See? That's too excited.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.913
-No, no! We should go check it out, right?
-Yeah.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.541
-Yes, we should. Let's go.
-Okay. Let's go.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.418
-[Judy groans]
-But, oh, sit back.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.170
I'm sorry. I feel so woozy.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.840
Let's chill for a minute.
We can't jump to conclusions here, okay?

04:58.923 --> 05:03.219
I'm not jumping to anything. I'm saying
it's a '66 Mustang with two DUIs

05:03.303 --> 05:06.180
and lives four blocks from where Ted
was hit. That's the fucking guy.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.223
It's pretty compelling.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.517
-I like him for it.
-I like him too.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.602
We should call Detective Perez,
loop her in.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.064
Oh, no. I'm not calling her. She's gonna
slow us down with her "process."

05:15.148 --> 05:17.817
Hey, I get it, okay?
But we can't run away with this thing.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.778
Nobody here has a badge, currently.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.113
Yeah, maybe he's right.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.741
Maybe we should just,
you know, slow it down.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.701
Okay. Yeah, maybe you're right.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.703
-You got to trust me.
-I trust you.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.456
Oh, gosh. You guys, you know what?
I'm late to pick up Charlie.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.541
-Uh... Will you keep an eye on her?
-Yeah.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.209
I'd love to.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.977
A little hot tea,
a little chicken soup from a can.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.354
Don't tell my mama.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.022
Oh...

05:56.731 --> 05:58.941
-Ugh! Soup smells so bad.
-Yup.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.693
-Sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.531
Nausea, fainting, sweats.
You thrown up at all?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.824
-Yes.
-Oh.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.370
You know, I'm not a doctor, but I'd say
it's either the flu or you're pregnant.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.830
Since you and I have been taking it slow,

06:12.914 --> 06:15.917
which is adorable but getting harder
every day, I'd say you have the flu.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.127
-[heartbeat]
-Unless you got a side piece.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.422
[ecstatic moaning]

06:27.470 --> 06:28.346
[whispering] Oh, shit.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.146
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.357
[sighs heavily]

06:42.276 --> 06:43.403
You're too good to me.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.279
No. It's nothing.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.616
You know that feeling you get
when a thing is new,

06:48.699 --> 06:53.621
and the person you're into gets sick,
or there's an emergency,

06:53.955 --> 06:57.166
it makes you realize, wow,
how much you care about them?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.253
Even though it hasn't been that long?
Do I sound like an idiot?

07:00.336 --> 07:01.212
No.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.757
You're such a great guy.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.095
Oh, shit.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.056
"You're such a great guy"?
Were you about to say, "But?"

07:12.432 --> 07:13.558
No.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.101
Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.519
Yes, I am.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.443
Honestly, before I met you,
I was engaged to someone.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.445
Okay.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.698
And he has suddenly
come back into the picture.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.201
And I don't wanna have
feelings for him, but I do.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.705
And I don't think that it's fair to you.

07:36.122 --> 07:36.998
[Nick inhales]

07:37.457 --> 07:38.291
Okay.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.710
I'm so sorry. I... [sighs]

07:41.002 --> 07:42.920
Steve and I are just
hot and cold, you know?

07:43.004 --> 07:43.838
Sometimes, I hate him

07:43.921 --> 07:46.466
and then the next minute,
it's the most passionate--

07:46.549 --> 07:48.676
-Yeah, I don't need the play-by-play.
-Right.

07:49.886 --> 07:50.803
I'm sorry.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.723
Should I...

07:54.432 --> 07:55.516
-You okay?
-I'm gonna go.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.020
Yeah, sure. You don't have to stay
and take care of me.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.190
-Yeah. It's a little awkward right now.
-Yeah, I guess.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.153
Thank you, though. For everything.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.658
I did not see this coming.
[laughs]

08:14.160 --> 08:15.453
Some detective, huh?

08:23.794 --> 08:24.670
Shit.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.936
[doorbell rings]

08:47.485 --> 08:49.403
Hi. Jen Harding.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.324
I was just driving back from another
listing and I had to stop because, wow!

08:53.616 --> 08:55.243
What a house! I mean...

08:55.701 --> 08:57.870
is there any possibility
you're interested in selling?

08:57.954 --> 09:01.123
Because prices are just insane
in this area right now.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.001
Really? All right. I'm interested.

09:04.961 --> 09:05.920
Andrew.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.463
Peters.

09:08.005 --> 09:08.881
Pleasure.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.260
-Please. Come on in.
-Thanks.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.976
[Jen] Wow. It's beautiful.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.520
I love the minimalism.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.063
So... sleek.

09:24.146 --> 09:24.981
Thanks.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.983
The ex-wife hated it.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.443
Oh. Well, then I hate her.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.987
[both laughing]

09:31.529 --> 09:33.406
-All right.
-All right.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.033
Can I get you a drink?

09:36.951 --> 09:40.663
Um... No. No, I shouldn't.
I'm on the clock.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.665
-Mind if I hit it?
-Sure.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.503
I made that myself.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.463
It's mahogany.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.383
Hmm. That's a quality wood.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.970
Got a whole workroom set up in my garage.

09:56.470 --> 10:00.057
Never met a time-sucking hobby
I couldn't get behind.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.685
Well, I'd love to see more of your work.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.606
Oh, yeah. I don't know.
The garage is kind of a mess.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.525
-I can handle a little dust.
-I'd rather not.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.404
You know...

10:14.488 --> 10:15.448
screw it. I...

10:16.407 --> 10:17.617
I will have that drink.

10:17.825 --> 10:18.659
Oh!

10:19.327 --> 10:20.578
All right. It's a party.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.123
-Touch of the brown stuff?
-Mm-hm.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.630
Here we are.

10:31.839 --> 10:32.965
That'll warm you up.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.508
Thanks.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.887
-Is it this way?
-Yeah. Right through that door.

10:40.848 --> 10:41.682
[Jen] Hmm.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.935
This... wood is really...

10:46.103 --> 10:49.607
Circles, uh... really honor the wood.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.609
You are too kind.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.488
Is this a '66 Mustang?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.032
Yes, it is. Good for you.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.451
You a car buff?

11:00.951 --> 11:03.162
-Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Mmm.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.918
-You mind if...
-Oh, God. Yeah.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.714
<i>Et voilà!</i>

11:16.467 --> 11:18.177
Another one of my projects.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.681
-Wanna check it out?
-Hmm?

11:22.223 --> 11:23.641
-Go on. Jump in.
-Oh.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.060
-All new interior. Just restored it.
-Okay.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.730
Should have seen it three months ago.
It was a wreck.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.940
Fingers and toes.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.820
Why are the tires off?
Did something happen?

11:36.320 --> 11:39.073
[chuckles] Nothing happened.
That's the problem.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.534
It's taken me fucking forever
to put this thing together.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.913
-[Andrew sighs]
-So you've... you've never driven it?

11:45.996 --> 11:46.831
Not yet.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.877
You would not believe how vicious
these car collectors are on eBay.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.548
Fucking jackals.
Anyway, check this out.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.468
[soft rock music playing]

11:59.719 --> 12:03.013
May not have an engine yet
but my stereo is hot.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.891
You know, I should probably get going.
It's late.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.685
-Whoa!
-Uh...

12:07.852 --> 12:09.478
-Hey.
-Can you let me out?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.689
-Easy. Be gentle with it.
-I'm getting claustrophobic.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.648
Please just...

12:12.732 --> 12:14.191
Let me help you out a little there.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.276
Okay.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.778
-God, you smell so good.
-No. That's not what this is.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.156
-Get off of me.
-No. Relax, it's fine.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.907
Get the fuck off me!

12:22.366 --> 12:23.492
[yells with pain]

12:24.577 --> 12:27.288
Bitch! What the fuck is wrong with you?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.206
No means motherfucking no.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.875
Get the fuck out of my house!

12:31.709 --> 12:35.379
[yelps] Fucking blood everywhere.
You bitch!

12:35.880 --> 12:36.714
[elevator bell pings]

12:42.970 --> 12:43.804
Hey, girl.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.598
Oh, Judy. Hey, girl.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.016
Girl, he's on a call.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.934
Some people think it's for pussies,
but I don't.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.021
No. I said I <i>don't </i>think it's for pussies.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.273
Yeah, I got to go too. Bye.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.484
-Hi.
-Hey.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.070
Uh... What's going on? Things are chaotic
right now. I don't have time to...

13:00.154 --> 13:02.281
I have to talk to you
about a couple of things.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.366
I got a meeting in five minutes.
If this can wait...

13:04.450 --> 13:05.701
-It can't.
-Okay.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.995
I broke up with the guy that I'm seeing.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.372
-Okay.
-Because he's not you.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.833
It's a high bar.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.419
And because...

13:16.921 --> 13:18.589
I think I might be pregnant.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.009
-Fuck! Seriously?
-Yeah.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.137
-How do you know it's mine?
-I never slept with him!

13:25.221 --> 13:26.305
That's weird.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.182
It's yours.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.560
-Judy, now? This is happening now?
-Yes, I know.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.229
But after everything we've been through,

13:33.312 --> 13:34.939
maybe we're finally getting
what we wanted.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.107
We get to have our family.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.987
I know it's scary, but sometimes
things happen in weird ways, right?

13:42.071 --> 13:42.905
[Steve] Hmm.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.032
Judy...

13:46.242 --> 13:49.245
this is not divine intervention, okay?
This is the definition of insanity,

13:49.328 --> 13:52.039
doing the same thing over and over again
hoping for a different result.

13:52.122 --> 13:52.957
We know the result.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.874
No, we don't.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.293
-We don't know the result.
-We lived the result five times.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.419
Maybe our luck has changed.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.380
Would you stop fucking
bright-siding everything?

13:59.463 --> 14:00.631
-Don't yell at me.
-Sorry.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.549
It's okay.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.008
[sighs]

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
Look, I can't put myself
through this again.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.932
I just can't. I'm sorry.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.018
You can call me in nine months if it...
You know?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.271
Or maybe just put yourself
out of your misery now.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.942
Put myself out of my misery?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.111
[door opens]

14:22.736 --> 14:23.904
-[Heidi] Hey, babe.
-Hey, babe.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.491
I got the sush.
Oh, my bad. I didn't mean to interrupt.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.035
-Hey. I'm just finishing up with a client.
-Oh.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.663
Sorry. I was in the bathroom.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.290
-Hey, girl.
-Hey, girl.

14:34.748 --> 14:35.583
Girl.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.710
[Steve] Kaley, would you take Heidi
to the break room?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.336
-I'm just gonna be a sec.
-Sure.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.554
What? You were seeing someone.

14:53.017 --> 14:53.851
What?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.229
What was the other thing
you wanted to say?

14:58.898 --> 14:59.732
What?

15:00.482 --> 15:01.775
You said a couple of things.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.527
What else?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.782
[heartbeat]

15:16.290 --> 15:17.124
Nothing.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.770
[heavy metal music blaring]

15:49.073 --> 15:51.075
-[music stops]
-[cell phone rings]

16:02.878 --> 16:03.754
Okay, okay.

16:07.132 --> 16:07.967
Hey.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.346
[Jen] You went straight to Steve?
You didn't even take a test yet?

16:12.429 --> 16:13.764
I did. I didn't have one.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.475
But I just know
because my boobs are so tender.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.644
All right. Stop staring at it, okay?

16:19.895 --> 16:22.272
A watched pee stick never turns positive.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.237
Do you want it to be positive
or do you not?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.072
I do.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.700
-You do?
-Oh, God, I do want it to be positive.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.868
But, you know, sometimes
when you really want something

16:34.994 --> 16:37.162
and you think if you hope for it,
it's not gonna happen?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.331
And if you don't hope for it,
maybe it will happen?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.667
-Mm-hm.
-But sometimes when you hope for things,

16:41.750 --> 16:42.584
they happen, right?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.045
So maybe I just...

16:45.921 --> 16:48.465
hope for the next three minutes.

16:49.758 --> 16:50.634
Okay.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.887
So you're gonna let yourself feel
how you actually feel.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.180
That's a good idea.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.057
Yeah. Thanks.

16:57.766 --> 17:02.354
But you are not allowed to feel positive
feelings towards Steve ever again.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.648
Even if that's how you actually feel.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.066
No, I won't. I can't.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.444
Okay. Because, you know,
you've gone back before.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.447
You are an addict. And he's meth...

17:11.822 --> 17:13.407
with impish good looks.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.742
Oh, God, he is.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.745
I hate his stupid fucking face.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.873
Okay. It's been two minutes. So, avert.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.666
Just don't. Don't...

17:22.750 --> 17:24.501
-I really wanna look at it.
-Don't do it.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.923
[Judy sighs deeply]

17:31.175 --> 17:32.468
Oh, I broke up with Nick.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.511
You did?

17:34.970 --> 17:36.013
-Yeah.
-Oh!

17:36.263 --> 17:38.849
I know. He deserves someone nicer than me.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.768
Who the fuck is nicer than you?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.896
Okay. Then maybe someone more stable.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.273
Well, that he can maybe find.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.945
Maybe it's not great
to be a single mom that's not stable.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.490
Whose mother is stable?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.326
And you won't be a single mom.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.369
You have me.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.749
We can be like
a three-child mothering team.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.835
-Mothering team.
-Aww!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.128
That's awesome!

18:08.921 --> 18:09.797
[beeping]

18:21.558 --> 18:22.726
-[sighs]
-Oh, shit.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.563
It's okay.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.112
You only see one line, right?

18:33.445 --> 18:34.279
Yeah.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.073
I'm sorry.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.244
I'm sorry.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.328
It's okay.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.080
It's okay.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.505
Well...

18:52.297 --> 18:54.174
you're probably not ready to hear this,
but...

18:55.050 --> 18:57.386
one tiny bit of a bright side.

18:59.054 --> 18:59.972
What?

19:00.806 --> 19:01.849
You can drink.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.726
[sighs] Yeah, I can drink.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.231
[Jen] I just got out of there
as fast as I could.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.608
Oh, my God! Fucking piece of shit.

19:11.692 --> 19:15.362
Yeah, but it's, like, you know,
I went into the house.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.739
-I got into the car.
-No, stop it.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.825
You're being, like, I asked for it.

19:19.908 --> 19:23.245
No, I know I wasn't... asking for it.
It's just...

19:24.454 --> 19:27.541
I'm pretty sure I broke his face,
so that feels good.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.044
Wow! That's awesome!
You are a tough broad.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.880
[chuckles] Hardly.

19:33.964 --> 19:34.882
You are.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.342
You're "don't mess with Texas," you know.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.343
What?

19:38.677 --> 19:41.847
Uh, am I Texas in that equation or...?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.849
Well, you're like Brooklyn, like,

19:43.932 --> 19:46.143
-[Brooklyn accent] "Don't fuck with me."
-[laughter]

19:46.268 --> 19:49.396
Is that... is that what you think
people sound like?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.523
You didn't think I was from the block
when I said it?

19:51.607 --> 19:52.691
-No.
-What?

19:52.900 --> 19:53.734
Oh, my God.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.611
-Then you do it.
-No, I'm not gonna do it.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.570
-Come on.
-No.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.487
Please?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.907
-Uh-uh.
-I've had a really shitty day.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.452
[Brooklyn accent] I used to
sound like this.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.953
[laughs]

20:05.370 --> 20:06.455
[Brooklyn accent] Like this.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.539
I love it so much!

20:07.956 --> 20:09.291
You're lucky you're sad.

20:13.921 --> 20:14.963
I shouldn't have let you go

20:15.047 --> 20:16.798
-to that guy's house.
-You didn't let me go.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.383
I just went.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.762
But you can't do that anymore.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.139
You can't go to strangers' houses.
It's not safe.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.516
-Okay? You have to stop. I mean it.
-I know.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.018
Yeah, I mean it too.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.646
Detective Perez called
and said if I don't stop,

20:30.729 --> 20:33.106
-they'll throw me in jail or something.
-What?

20:33.273 --> 20:34.107
Mm-hm.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.401
Yeah. That's the world we're living in.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.322
I get assaulted and then I get in trouble
and a criminal walks free.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.660
God, I just wish it was him.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.454
Yeah. Me too.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.877
I know you think that if you find
the person who did this,

20:53.961 --> 20:55.504
it's gonna make you feel better.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.717
I really don't think it will.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.729
I guess I just wanted my
fucking three minutes of hope.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.484
But no.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.111
Yeah.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.282
Hope will burn you like that.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.369
Yeah.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.497
[water running]

21:42.342 --> 21:43.427
Jen!

21:44.720 --> 21:45.595
Is it?

21:46.013 --> 21:47.014
Yeah, it is.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.934
-It's positive now, right?
-Yeah. It is.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.270
-Holy shit.
-And that's two lines, not one, right?

21:53.353 --> 21:54.646
-Yes, clearly, yes.
-Clearly.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.064
God, you know what that means?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.817
Yeah. That I'm the asshole
that bought you the cheap test.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.111
Yeah, who buys store brand?
I thought you were my friend.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.322
-Who cares? You're pregnant.
-Oh, my God!

22:03.780 --> 22:05.073
You're not pregnant.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.409
Sorry, what?

22:07.784 --> 22:09.036
You're not pregnant.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.122
Oh, no, but I...

22:12.205 --> 22:14.750
In fact, your estrogen levels are so low,

22:14.833 --> 22:17.461
it'd be impossible for you
to get pregnant.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.129
I'm so sorry.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.341
No, but the test said that I was pregnant.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.260
Unfortunately,
if you leave it out for too long,

22:25.552 --> 22:27.179
it can show false positive.

22:29.181 --> 22:33.226
I don't understand. Then what are
all these symptoms that I'm having?

22:33.935 --> 22:37.397
Those symptoms can also be indicative
of early menopause.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.777
I'm so sorry.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.825
Uh, yeah.
I would say that Perez's tone was firm.

22:49.076 --> 22:49.910
Um...

22:50.160 --> 22:52.871
The words "cease and desist" were used.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.289
[Nick] <i>Ah, okay.</i>

22:55.165 --> 22:56.291
Understood.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.419
<i>I am so sorry, Nick.</i>
<i>I hope I didn't get you in any trouble.</i>

22:59.920 --> 23:02.964
Oh, no. No, don't worry about it.
You didn't get me in any trouble.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.177
Hey. I also wanted to say sorry
about you and Judy.

23:07.594 --> 23:11.014
Yeah. That didn't quite work out
the way I'd hoped.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.934
[sighing] <i>Most things don't.</i>

23:14.559 --> 23:15.769
What can you do, though?

23:16.520 --> 23:21.316
<i>Look, I love Judy, but I will be</i>
<i>the first to admit that she...</i>

23:22.526 --> 23:24.444
<i>she can be a little hard to pin down.</i>

23:25.362 --> 23:26.196
Yeah.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.660
-[door closes]
-Yeah.

23:33.829 --> 23:34.704
I'm not.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.748
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.166
And I never will be.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.336
I gotta go. It's an emergency.

23:41.753 --> 23:42.838
<i>Yeah. Me too.</i>
