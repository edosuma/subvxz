04:24.120 --> 04:26.123
Betsy,
breakfast is ready.

04:31.762 --> 04:32.960
Good morning.

04:32.962 --> 04:34.029
Good morning.

04:34.031 --> 04:35.096
Coffee?

04:35.098 --> 04:36.067
Yes, please.

04:39.101 --> 04:40.301
Okay, that's yours.

04:40.303 --> 04:42.206
Thank you.

04:42.705 --> 04:43.340
What?

04:46.075 --> 04:47.111
Hello?

04:49.111 --> 04:50.344
No, no, no, no, no,

04:50.346 --> 04:52.248
they're in the back next
to the other grinders.

04:53.283 --> 04:54.819
Yeah, in the far back.

04:56.452 --> 04:58.053
Okay, thanks.

04:58.055 --> 04:58.889
Okay, bye.

04:59.423 --> 05:00.354
Is everything ok?

05:00.356 --> 05:02.022
Hunter can't man the store

05:02.024 --> 05:03.190
without me being there,

05:03.192 --> 05:05.125
so I know it's not much,

05:05.127 --> 05:07.197
but toast and coffee.

05:09.332 --> 05:10.166
Kayte,

05:12.769 --> 05:14.138
thank you for everything.

05:15.305 --> 05:16.674
Yeah, of course B.

05:19.209 --> 05:20.244
Eat.

05:24.147 --> 05:25.783
What can I get
for you guys today?

05:26.849 --> 05:28.051
I would like a...

05:40.964 --> 05:42.162
I will have...

05:42.164 --> 05:44.498
Dusty, will you just order?

05:44.500 --> 05:49.673
A berry cordial, passion
orange guava steamer

05:51.240 --> 05:56.212
with iced cafe,

05:57.214 --> 06:01.918
and a hefty dollop
of whip, please.

06:03.286 --> 06:04.219
Really?

06:04.221 --> 06:06.421
Right, and for you, sir?

06:06.423 --> 06:09.257
Large coffee, black.

06:09.259 --> 06:11.359
All right, will that be all?

06:11.361 --> 06:14.229
Actually, I have that instead.

06:14.231 --> 06:15.933
All right, 3.80.

06:18.235 --> 06:20.705
Here we go, yep.

06:22.305 --> 06:24.272
And I'll give you that.

06:37.954 --> 06:39.120
Really?

06:39.122 --> 06:39.988
What?

06:39.990 --> 06:42.159
It keeps your hand
from being scalded.

06:44.394 --> 06:46.329
They teach you anything
in the academy.

06:47.497 --> 06:49.500
Oh, I've been out
of it for 25 years.

06:51.101 --> 06:51.836
Did you get that report
done on that accident?

06:52.301 --> 06:53.267
I did.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.070
Didn't you see it this
morning on your desk?

06:55.538 --> 06:56.871
Did you type it?

06:56.873 --> 06:59.073
You put the handwritten
one on my desk.

06:59.075 --> 07:01.142
What if the reason I do that

07:01.144 --> 07:02.577
is to give it personal flair

07:02.579 --> 07:05.382
because I'm trying to build
my brand within the force.

07:06.183 --> 07:07.147
You know that.

07:07.149 --> 07:08.082
You're not gonna believe...

07:08.084 --> 07:09.286
Hey, Kayte, how you doing?

07:10.353 --> 07:11.021
Oh, my favorite dynamic duo.

07:11.921 --> 07:12.587
- Hi, boys.
- Hello.

07:12.589 --> 07:14.322
So how's it going?

07:14.324 --> 07:17.558
Oh, you know, just another
lovely day in paradise here.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.193
And who's this?

07:19.195 --> 07:21.128
This is my very
good friend Betsy.

07:21.130 --> 07:22.263
Hello.

07:22.265 --> 07:25.001
Yeah, her and I actually
grew up on base together.

07:25.868 --> 07:26.835
Ah, another army brat, huh?

07:26.837 --> 07:28.536
- That's right.
- Cool.

07:28.538 --> 07:31.341
So what brings you here to
our little slice of heaven?

07:32.209 --> 07:34.845
I...

07:38.214 --> 07:41.518
No, it's actually a much
needed change of scenery.

07:43.286 --> 07:45.520
You know what, how
about you go make sure

07:45.522 --> 07:47.190
Hunter isn't burning
down my coffee shop?

07:48.024 --> 07:48.858
Okay.

07:49.526 --> 07:50.892
It was nice to meet you both.

07:50.894 --> 07:53.364
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

07:55.065 --> 07:56.233
All right, what's her story?

07:56.899 --> 07:57.500
Okay.

07:59.603 --> 08:03.104
So this can't get around, okay?

08:03.106 --> 08:04.371
Guys, about three weeks ago,

08:04.373 --> 08:06.576
she was severely attacked.

08:09.045 --> 08:09.880
She...

08:10.413 --> 08:11.613
She was attacked?

08:11.615 --> 08:13.513
Yeah, some lunatic
just jumped her

08:13.515 --> 08:14.948
when she was walking home,

08:14.950 --> 08:16.984
and just, and when
I say attacked her,

08:16.986 --> 08:19.120
he almost ripped her throat out.

08:19.122 --> 08:20.387
Jesus.

08:20.389 --> 08:22.957
Okay, so she's been
through a lot, right?

08:22.959 --> 08:24.491
And she's here for a fresh start

08:24.493 --> 08:25.894
and she's staying with me.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.262
I'm just trying to
make her feel at home,

08:28.264 --> 08:31.965
okay, so you guys can just
keep an eye on her with me.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.433
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, she's cool.

08:33.434 --> 08:35.568
Yeah, just kind of make
her feel comfortable.

08:35.571 --> 08:36.602
I'm looking at you.

08:36.605 --> 08:38.273
Cool as ice.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.342
Okay.

08:39.943 --> 08:40.410
Is she okay?

08:42.011 --> 08:43.147
No.

08:44.414 --> 08:45.246
But that's okay,

08:45.248 --> 08:46.347
because I'm here for her

08:46.349 --> 08:49.152
and now you guys know, so.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.654
Yeah, we don't wanna
hold you up anymore.

08:52.656 --> 08:54.222
Yeah, yeah.

08:54.224 --> 08:55.423
I've got a business to run.

08:55.425 --> 08:57.592
Sorry guys, but I
hope to see you soon.

08:57.594 --> 08:58.425
Yeah.

08:58.427 --> 08:59.462
Okay.

09:00.430 --> 09:01.162
- Yeah, we'll see you.
- Okay.

09:01.164 --> 09:01.298
Thanks, guys.

09:03.967 --> 09:05.502
Do you think they
caught the guy?

09:06.670 --> 09:07.601
Guys, don't you
have anything better

09:07.603 --> 09:09.370
to do with my tax dollars?

09:09.372 --> 09:10.672
Hey, Sam.

09:10.674 --> 09:11.972
- Hey, hey, Ranger Rick.
- Hey.

09:11.974 --> 09:13.444
Catch any beavers today?

09:14.243 --> 09:15.208
Yeah, yeah.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.412
What's going on, guys?

09:17.414 --> 09:18.645
You still coming over
for dinner tonight?

09:18.647 --> 09:20.414
As long as you're
not cooking, yeah.

09:25.121 --> 09:26.386
Hello, what can I?

09:29.059 --> 09:31.024
Sorry, what can I make you?

09:31.026 --> 09:34.364
I'll have a large
black, three sugars.

09:44.007 --> 09:45.340
Here you go.

09:45.342 --> 09:48.375
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

09:48.377 --> 09:50.178
Horror, I really like horror.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.412
- Okay.
- What?

09:51.414 --> 09:53.648
- I bet you do.
- Thanks, man.

09:53.650 --> 09:56.384
Hey, what's with the new girl?

09:56.386 --> 09:57.217
That's Kayte's friend.

09:57.219 --> 09:58.251
Her name is Betsy.

09:58.253 --> 09:59.089
No.

09:59.355 --> 10:00.089
What?

10:00.757 --> 10:02.289
I've seen that look before.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.426
What look are
we talking about?

10:04.227 --> 10:06.660
Oh, that look.

10:06.662 --> 10:08.096
That one right there.

10:08.098 --> 10:09.329
It's the same one you had

10:09.331 --> 10:11.131
the first time you laid
eyes on Jenny Jenkins.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.467
- Okay, here we go, yeah.
- Who?

10:12.469 --> 10:14.302
Jenny Jenkins?

10:14.304 --> 10:15.403
- Who's Jenny Jenkins?
- Stop.

10:15.405 --> 10:18.639
Jenny Jenkins was his
middle school girlfriend.

10:18.641 --> 10:20.308
- That is, until he...
- Oh, come on, man.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.776
He caught her giving
Brandon Prewitt a hand job

10:22.778 --> 10:24.678
at the skate rink.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.114
All right, great, thank you.

10:26.116 --> 10:27.481
It was a blowj, by the
way, but gentlemen,

10:27.483 --> 10:29.483
have a nice one.

10:29.485 --> 10:32.252
Ouch.

10:32.254 --> 10:33.453
- He's crazy.
- Some kids never learn.

10:33.455 --> 10:34.490
That kid.

10:37.493 --> 10:39.226
I'm getting better.

10:39.228 --> 10:42.295
I'm looking at this
as a positive thing.

10:42.297 --> 10:45.500
You know, I survived something
I never thought I'd have to.

10:45.502 --> 10:47.735
You're right and
that's a really great

10:47.737 --> 10:49.537
way to look at this,

10:49.539 --> 10:51.338
and I think it's
very brave of you

10:51.340 --> 10:55.342
to say that in front of
a group of strangers.

10:55.344 --> 10:55.945
Thank you.

10:57.414 --> 11:01.048
Well, I want you all to know

11:01.050 --> 11:03.418
that you're survivors.

11:03.420 --> 11:06.453
You have lived through
some terrible things,

11:06.455 --> 11:09.823
and you're here, you're
alive, and you're safe,

11:09.825 --> 11:13.596
so please feel free
to continue to share,

11:15.698 --> 11:17.130
and speaking of sharing,

11:17.132 --> 11:19.567
I think we have
time for one more,

11:19.569 --> 11:21.803
so I think we'll give
our newest member here

11:21.805 --> 11:24.074
a chance to speak, if she likes.

11:25.507 --> 11:26.676
If you're ready, of course.

11:28.377 --> 11:29.345
Hi, everybody.

11:30.213 --> 11:31.478
Hi.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.680
I honestly have
no clue what to say.

11:33.682 --> 11:34.517
That's fine.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.353
Why don't you start
with your name?

11:38.454 --> 11:41.057
Hi, my name is B.. Kayte.

11:41.590 --> 11:42.291
My name is Kayte.

11:45.295 --> 11:46.726
Share whatever you
feel comfortable sharing.

11:46.728 --> 11:48.297
Don't feel any pressure.

11:52.669 --> 11:55.506
A little over three
weeks ago, I was attacked.

11:57.239 --> 11:58.573
I was walking to my car

11:58.575 --> 12:02.409
and somebody grabbed me
and drug me into the alley

12:02.411 --> 12:03.247
and then they...

12:06.148 --> 12:10.620
I ended up spending a
week in the hospital,

12:12.287 --> 12:15.323
and I came to this
area a few weeks back

12:15.325 --> 12:18.295
and now I'm living
with my friend.

12:20.396 --> 12:23.132
The doctor told
my friend, Betsy,

12:23.800 --> 12:27.434
that I should seek therapy

12:27.436 --> 12:30.573
and they didn't find
much around here,

12:32.508 --> 12:36.644
so that's why I'm here.

12:36.646 --> 12:39.380
That's all I really have to
say about that right now.

12:39.382 --> 12:40.881
Well, that's perfectly fine,

12:40.883 --> 12:43.918
and Kayte, you're welcome here,

12:43.920 --> 12:45.819
so thank you for coming back,

12:45.821 --> 12:49.222
and if you feel
like you just need

12:49.224 --> 12:51.159
to sit and listen
more, that's great.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.528
Take your time because
this is your second visit,

12:53.530 --> 12:55.531
so just wait until
you're comfortable.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.600
All right, everybody,
well if you remember,

12:59.602 --> 13:03.571
our first meeting next
week is on Wednesday,

13:03.573 --> 13:04.905
and if you haven't done so yet,

13:04.907 --> 13:08.342
please stop off an
update your contact info

13:08.344 --> 13:10.343
on the group's phone tree.

13:10.345 --> 13:12.482
I like to be able to get
ahold of some of you,

13:13.616 --> 13:16.120
and we will just,

13:17.487 --> 13:18.755
I'll see you next week, okay?

13:19.622 --> 13:20.591
Goodnight everyone.

13:37.574 --> 13:38.709
There she is.

13:46.616 --> 13:47.648
Oh hi.

13:47.650 --> 13:48.685
Hello.

13:49.419 --> 13:49.884
How was the meeting?

13:49.886 --> 13:50.750
It was fine.

13:50.752 --> 13:51.851
Oh, heads up.

13:51.853 --> 13:53.888
- Hi, Kayte?
- Hi.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.590
I noticed when you
were on your way out

13:55.592 --> 13:58.491
that you didn't stop and
give us your contact info.

13:58.493 --> 14:00.627
I need that if you wanna
keep coming to group.

14:00.629 --> 14:01.662
Is it all right if
I get your number?

14:01.664 --> 14:02.496
Of course.

14:02.498 --> 14:03.331
Okay, what is it?

14:03.333 --> 14:06.637
It's 515-432-6189.

14:07.637 --> 14:09.370
Okay and I just
wanted to thank you

14:09.372 --> 14:11.239
for sharing with us tonight.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.540
I know that that was hard

14:13.542 --> 14:15.875
and I'm assuming that
this is your friend Betsy.

14:15.877 --> 14:18.446
So you seem to be doing
some great things for her.

14:18.448 --> 14:19.679
- Hi, yes.
- Hi.

14:19.681 --> 14:21.348
- Betsy, nice to meet you.
- James.

14:21.350 --> 14:22.616
James, oh hello,
nice to meet you.

14:22.618 --> 14:23.884
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

14:23.886 --> 14:25.653
So I guess I'll
see you next week.

14:25.655 --> 14:26.520
- Of course.
- All right.

14:26.522 --> 14:27.722
Have a good night,
Kayte, bye, Betsy.

14:27.724 --> 14:28.622
It was nice to meet you.

14:28.624 --> 14:29.892
You too.

14:33.496 --> 14:35.899
So Kayte how do you spell that?

14:38.734 --> 14:40.768
I panicked, okay?

14:40.770 --> 14:42.636
All right.

14:42.638 --> 14:44.739
Are you ready to close
up shop with me, then.

14:44.741 --> 14:46.774
- Yep, let's go.
- Okay.

14:51.013 --> 14:54.582
So Kayte, you wanna tell
me more about the meeting?

14:54.584 --> 14:56.384
Never gonna live this down.

14:56.386 --> 14:58.752
No, never will
you live this down.

15:04.993 --> 15:08.328
Jillian, that was amazing.

15:08.330 --> 15:09.864
Oh, thank you, Sam.

15:09.866 --> 15:12.399
Did you hear that, hon, amazing?

15:12.401 --> 15:13.867
Baby girl, he
ain't saying anything

15:13.869 --> 15:15.671
I haven't said before.

15:16.672 --> 15:17.807
So...

15:18.907 --> 15:21.877
Sam, seeing anyone yet?

15:23.478 --> 15:25.346
Not at the moment.

15:26.682 --> 15:28.618
What?

15:29.752 --> 15:32.053
Well, our friend
Sam here fell in love

15:32.055 --> 15:33.821
at the coffee shop today.

15:33.823 --> 15:36.356
Oh, do what, with who?

15:36.358 --> 15:37.728
Who said anything about love?

15:38.761 --> 15:39.860
Kayte's friend?

15:39.862 --> 15:42.630
He gave her the look.

15:42.632 --> 15:44.664
The Jenny Jenkins look?

15:44.666 --> 15:45.832
Yep.

15:45.834 --> 15:46.936
Oh my gosh.

15:48.738 --> 15:50.474
Well, what's she like?

15:51.641 --> 15:53.673
I didn't give her
any type of look.

15:53.675 --> 15:56.409
He's blowing this way out
of proportion as usual.

15:56.411 --> 15:59.548
Well, describe
this alleged look.

16:00.717 --> 16:01.749
It wasn't a look.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.583
Yeah, there was,

16:03.585 --> 16:06.553
the glossed over eyes, his
mouth open a little bit.

16:06.555 --> 16:08.989
Ooh, that's precious.

16:08.991 --> 16:11.358
Did he get really
dumb suddenly too?

16:11.360 --> 16:12.559
Yep.

16:12.561 --> 16:13.397
Aww.

16:14.863 --> 16:17.497
So, Sam, we actually
just left off

16:17.499 --> 16:20.768
at you not got giving
this mystery woman

16:20.770 --> 16:22.470
the Jenny Jenkins look,

16:22.472 --> 16:25.805
but you actually did give
her the Jenny Jenkins look,

16:25.807 --> 16:27.475
continue.

16:27.477 --> 16:28.943
She's cute.

16:28.945 --> 16:31.010
That's all I can say.

16:31.012 --> 16:32.413
She took my coffee order

16:32.415 --> 16:33.780
and that was the
extent of our talk.

16:33.782 --> 16:36.449
Such bullshit,
man, I was there.

16:36.451 --> 16:39.720
I saw it, it was like love
at first sight kind of shit.

16:39.722 --> 16:40.855
Oh wow.

16:40.857 --> 16:41.892
Oh my gosh.

16:42.758 --> 16:43.592
Okay.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.629
Wow, look at the time.

16:48.631 --> 16:49.563
I must be going.

16:49.565 --> 16:51.765
- Oh, well.
- Jill.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.701
- All right.
- As always, thank you.

16:53.703 --> 16:54.834
- Hey, it was fun.
- For dinner.

16:54.836 --> 16:56.069
- It was great.
- Good seeing you.

16:56.071 --> 16:57.103
Thanks for coming over.

16:57.105 --> 16:58.539
- Collin.
- Yep.

16:58.541 --> 16:59.409
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, you too.

17:01.844 --> 17:03.910
- That was fun.
- Jenny Jenkins look.

17:05.815 --> 17:06.913
Aww.

17:06.915 --> 17:09.648
- Hopeless romantic.
- I know.

18:29.931 --> 18:31.601
What is happening?

19:10.907 --> 19:12.042
Shit, shit, shit.

19:14.209 --> 19:15.578
B, come on, we're gonna be late.

19:20.549 --> 19:21.183
Betsy?

19:24.286 --> 19:25.654
What the hell?

19:28.056 --> 19:28.922
Oh my god.

19:28.924 --> 19:30.189
Oh my god.

19:30.191 --> 19:31.124
Betsy?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.226
- No, no.
- Hey.

19:32.228 --> 19:34.928
Hey, hey, come on.

19:35.765 --> 19:36.930
Come on.

19:36.932 --> 19:38.932
- No!
- Oh my god.

19:38.934 --> 19:40.066
Oh my god, Betsy.

19:40.068 --> 19:41.171
It's just me, it's just me.

19:42.103 --> 19:43.507
Look at me, look at me.

19:44.105 --> 19:45.275
Look at me.

19:47.742 --> 19:50.079
Oh, my sweet girl, it's just me.

19:52.981 --> 19:54.283
Oh god, come here.

19:55.985 --> 19:56.820
Come here.

19:59.822 --> 20:01.054
Oh.

20:02.624 --> 20:03.792
Hey, what's going on?

20:05.061 --> 20:06.596
Huh, talk to me.

20:07.930 --> 20:08.963
What's going on?

20:08.965 --> 20:10.767
It's just a bad dream.

20:11.901 --> 20:13.233
I think you should
stay home today.

20:13.235 --> 20:14.200
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah.

20:14.202 --> 20:16.236
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

20:16.238 --> 20:17.170
Okay.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.807
Betsy, you're not okay.

20:19.208 --> 20:19.676
You're not okay.

20:20.109 --> 20:20.677
I'll be fine.

20:21.076 --> 20:22.077
I'll be fine.

20:22.344 --> 20:23.012
Well.

20:24.113 --> 20:26.783
God, I'm running really late.

20:27.984 --> 20:28.949
So...

20:28.951 --> 20:31.084
You stay home, I can go
to the shop by myself.

20:31.086 --> 20:31.986
No big deal.

20:31.988 --> 20:33.621
You stay home, you rest.

20:33.623 --> 20:34.254
It's not a big deal.

20:34.256 --> 20:35.889
It really isn't.

20:35.891 --> 20:37.727
No, I just need to
shower and some fresh air

20:38.259 --> 20:39.092
and I'll be fine.

20:39.094 --> 20:40.727
I'll be fine.

20:40.729 --> 20:42.028
- I'll meet you at work.
- Betsy.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.198
I promise, I'm okay.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.733
Are you sure?

20:45.735 --> 20:46.367
Yeah.

20:46.369 --> 20:47.200
100%.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.003
Of course.

20:50.672 --> 20:51.907
Okay.

20:53.008 --> 20:55.008
I love you.

20:55.010 --> 20:57.044
You call me if
you need anything.

20:57.046 --> 20:59.045
I know.

20:59.047 --> 21:00.883
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

21:51.033 --> 21:52.202
This is Sam.

21:55.270 --> 21:58.207
Yeah, I'm headed out to Sycamore
to set up those trail cams.

21:59.107 --> 22:00.109
Okay.

22:01.242 --> 22:02.044
Yeah.

22:19.995 --> 22:21.965
Hey, you need a ride?

22:25.433 --> 22:27.101
Hello?

22:33.374 --> 22:34.941
Ugh, that's a
little fucking rude.

22:34.943 --> 22:35.976
Hey, bitch, do you need a...

22:35.978 --> 22:37.844
Fuck off, douche bag.

22:46.889 --> 22:48.388
Is there a problem?

22:50.526 --> 22:52.059
Are you okay?

22:58.933 --> 23:01.067
What was that about?

23:01.069 --> 23:02.871
Some dick tried to pick me up.

23:04.206 --> 23:05.171
But you're okay?

23:05.173 --> 23:06.408
Yeah.

23:10.478 --> 23:13.280
So...

23:13.282 --> 23:14.117
So...

23:17.318 --> 23:19.888
So how long you been
working for Kayte?

23:21.023 --> 23:21.925
About a week now.

23:28.363 --> 23:29.199
And you?

23:30.266 --> 23:31.331
Oh, no.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.265
I'm just a game warden.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.333
I make sure that all the hunters

23:34.335 --> 23:35.435
are playing by the rules.

23:35.437 --> 23:38.338
They have their licenses
and they're not poaching,

23:38.340 --> 23:40.477
but I also study the
habits of the animals.

23:41.576 --> 23:42.845
Sounds interesting.

23:43.845 --> 23:45.047
Not at all but thanks.

23:51.853 --> 23:53.189
You have a beautiful smile.

24:11.207 --> 24:12.471
All right, here you
go, you're all set.

24:15.611 --> 24:17.343
Hey, Betsy.

24:17.345 --> 24:17.979
Yeah?

24:19.347 --> 24:22.251
Are you busy tomorrow night?

24:23.986 --> 24:25.388
I have a thing.

24:26.889 --> 24:28.287
Thursday night.

24:28.289 --> 24:29.124
She's free.

24:31.326 --> 24:32.327
Yep, Thursday.

24:34.363 --> 24:37.333
Food, do you wanna
get dinner with me?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.901
This
is where you say yes

24:41.903 --> 24:43.102
Sure.

24:43.939 --> 24:44.905
That'd be great.

24:44.907 --> 24:45.542
Awesome.

24:46.875 --> 24:47.608
Eight o'clock?

24:47.610 --> 24:49.212
Yes, eight's good for her.

24:50.645 --> 24:54.349
I can be here or wherever
a little bit before eight.

24:55.417 --> 24:56.382
I don't know if here or here...

24:56.384 --> 24:57.316
No, Sam, come to the
house, to the house.

24:57.318 --> 24:58.317
Okay, thanks.

24:58.319 --> 25:01.487
I'll see you at eight then...

25:01.489 --> 25:03.122
Eight o'clock Thursday.

25:03.124 --> 25:04.291
Yep, cool thanks.

25:04.293 --> 25:05.359
- Okay, bye Sam.
- But...

25:05.361 --> 25:06.362
Bye.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.364
Oh, what?

25:10.932 --> 25:11.567
Betsy...

25:16.037 --> 25:18.438
You picked her up on
the side of the road.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.340
Porn movies start
out like that, man.

25:20.342 --> 25:22.942
I know, right place,
right time, I guess,

25:22.944 --> 25:24.378
plus some fucking creepy guy

25:24.380 --> 25:26.178
was trying to pick
her up, I think.

25:26.180 --> 25:28.450
Oh, you were her
knight in shining armor.

25:29.351 --> 25:31.154
Three shots of vodka, please.

25:33.154 --> 25:35.522
So wait, you said some guy

25:35.524 --> 25:37.293
was trying to pick her up?

25:38.324 --> 25:39.959
Yeah, I don't know.

25:39.961 --> 25:40.596
It was weird.

25:41.963 --> 25:43.365
Did you get a
good look at him?

25:44.533 --> 25:46.233
I guess, good enough to know

25:46.235 --> 25:47.937
that he was fucking
wicked creepy.

25:52.106 --> 25:53.439
Guys, I can't.

25:53.441 --> 25:55.108
- Yes, you can.
- Yep.

25:55.110 --> 25:58.445
Here is to friends,
family, and to Sam getting

25:58.447 --> 26:00.179
back in the saddle.

26:00.181 --> 26:01.017
Fuck you.

26:03.584 --> 26:05.485
Another round, please.

26:05.487 --> 26:09.359
So can you give me a
description of this guy?

26:11.427 --> 26:15.227
About five ten, dark features.

26:15.229 --> 26:17.232
Sunken eyes, really
fucking spooky.

26:19.434 --> 26:20.967
You think it might be him?

26:20.969 --> 26:21.603
What?

26:23.439 --> 26:24.340
It's Walt Delaney, man.

26:26.475 --> 26:28.441
Have you heard the
story of Walt Delaney?

26:28.443 --> 26:29.278
No.

26:32.581 --> 26:33.416
All right.

26:35.084 --> 26:37.387
Four years ago, he beat the
hell out of his girlfriend.

26:40.154 --> 26:42.522
I'm not talking about like
love taps or anything,

26:42.524 --> 26:44.661
I'm talking
reconstructive surgery.

26:46.228 --> 26:47.494
It was brutal, real bad.

26:47.496 --> 26:50.296
This guy put her in
a coma for two weeks.

26:50.298 --> 26:51.401
He damn near killed her.

26:55.136 --> 26:56.271
Jesus Christ.

27:03.112 --> 27:03.947
One more please.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.315
There you go.

27:12.787 --> 27:15.691
Oh my god, it's so
cold in this house.

27:17.492 --> 27:18.425
Oh.

27:18.427 --> 27:19.626
What movie do you wanna watch?

27:19.628 --> 27:20.596
Oh, I don't care.

27:21.529 --> 27:22.597
Doesn't matter to me.

27:25.667 --> 27:29.136
Can I talk to you
about something?

27:29.138 --> 27:30.573
Yeah, yeah, of course.

27:31.539 --> 27:33.041
So Sam...

27:34.476 --> 27:36.478
Do you, what do you think?

27:38.180 --> 27:39.713
Sam's great.

27:39.715 --> 27:42.719
No, no, Sam's a really good guy.

27:45.453 --> 27:47.286
But...

27:47.288 --> 27:48.123
What's wrong?

27:55.229 --> 27:57.563
So I know that I've been
kind of pushy with Sam.

27:57.565 --> 27:58.832
- Just a little bit.
- I know.

27:58.834 --> 27:59.669
I know.

28:03.271 --> 28:06.206
I guess I just need to make
sure that you're ready.

28:06.208 --> 28:07.477
Ready for what, exactly?

28:10.813 --> 28:14.150
I have no idea

28:15.651 --> 28:17.350
the emotional toll

28:17.352 --> 28:21.254
and your experiences and
what you've been through.

28:21.256 --> 28:25.294
Betsy, I can't even
imagine that kind of pain.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.164
And I love you very much.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.532
And I just need to be sure

28:32.534 --> 28:33.766
that you're gonna be okay

28:33.768 --> 28:35.604
with getting involved
with someone again.

28:38.539 --> 28:39.738
I appreciate that.

28:39.740 --> 28:40.575
Yeah.

28:42.611 --> 28:43.746
I think I'm ready.

28:46.148 --> 28:47.650
But just to let you know,

28:48.549 --> 28:50.149
I totally approve of Sam.

28:50.151 --> 28:51.653
- Really?
- Yeah, I do.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.656
He's so cute.

28:55.657 --> 28:56.659
Oh my god.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.195
He makes me smile.

29:00.295 --> 29:02.161
That's good.

29:02.163 --> 29:04.299
I haven't smiled for a while.

29:05.467 --> 29:07.633
Yeah, you're right
and you deserve that.

29:07.635 --> 29:09.169
Do you know what
you're gonna wear?

29:09.171 --> 29:10.506
I have the perfect dress.

29:15.677 --> 29:18.144
Get this guy out of here.

29:20.681 --> 29:21.881
Oh man.

29:24.519 --> 29:26.719
I'm gonna grab on this side,

29:26.721 --> 29:28.155
you catch him when he
comes out, all right.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.622
On it, we are on it.

29:29.624 --> 29:30.625
Let's get your feet.

29:31.559 --> 29:31.891
- No.
- Gotta get the baby.

29:31.893 --> 29:33.259
No, no.

29:35.663 --> 29:36.429
All right.

29:36.431 --> 29:37.866
- You got the door.
- All right.

29:38.667 --> 29:39.368
Night, Sam.

29:41.603 --> 29:43.139
Good night.

29:43.805 --> 29:44.640
She totally wants me.

29:47.642 --> 29:48.478
All right, Sam.

29:49.210 --> 29:49.809
Let's go, let's go.

29:49.811 --> 29:50.610
Come on, big guy.

29:50.612 --> 29:51.678
Three is a crowd, boys.

29:51.680 --> 29:52.715
Yeah, right?

29:54.815 --> 29:58.251
- Oh.
- He is not light.

29:58.253 --> 30:00.620
- Oh, right on, man.
- What are you doing man?

30:00.622 --> 30:02.255
I'm taking off his delightful

30:02.257 --> 30:04.757
Robin's egg blue boat
shoes is what I'm doing.

30:04.759 --> 30:07.694
Oh, yeah, you gonna
get him off next.

30:07.696 --> 30:09.262
Hey, listen.

30:09.264 --> 30:11.797
Let's just, let him pass out.

30:11.799 --> 30:13.667
He won't remember any of this.

30:13.669 --> 30:15.569
Let's get out of here.

30:40.394 --> 30:42.464
Jesus, Betsy, what the
hell is wrong with you?

30:43.532 --> 30:44.367
God.

30:44.799 --> 30:45.534
I'm so sorry.

30:49.537 --> 30:51.004
It's fine.

30:51.006 --> 30:53.476
I was waking you up
'cause you were screaming.

30:56.777 --> 30:57.877
I'm so sorry.

30:57.879 --> 31:00.846
No, it's fine, it's fine.

31:00.848 --> 31:02.748
You have group in an hour.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.687
Okay, what?

31:06.654 --> 31:07.856
Yeah, you, god.

31:09.757 --> 31:10.660
You slept all day.

31:11.727 --> 31:12.562
God.

31:13.428 --> 31:14.593
- Just...
- I...

31:14.595 --> 31:16.396
No, get ready real fast.

31:16.398 --> 31:17.663
Just take me to work
and then you can take

31:17.665 --> 31:18.765
the car to the meeting.

31:18.767 --> 31:20.902
I'll just get a ride home
from Hunter or someone.

31:27.676 --> 31:31.514
Well, it's a pretty
small group tonight.

31:33.315 --> 31:34.683
Some of you know, this happens.

31:36.817 --> 31:39.486
You know, people come and go.

31:39.488 --> 31:41.556
You'll see that a lot.

31:42.824 --> 31:44.791
That just goes to show
that everyone's dealing

31:44.793 --> 31:47.326
with the things that
happened to them

31:47.328 --> 31:48.695
in their own way.

31:48.697 --> 31:51.300
Everybody's at their
own stages of recovery.

31:52.867 --> 31:57.871
That can be very lonely and
frightening thing, feeling.

31:57.873 --> 32:01.908
You might be experiencing
residual shock,

32:01.910 --> 32:04.878
confusion, being overwhelmed.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.616
It's all completely normal.

32:08.450 --> 32:11.418
It's like your body is
detached from your own mind,

32:11.420 --> 32:13.053
and your body's doing one thing

32:13.055 --> 32:15.755
while your mind is
trying to process

32:15.757 --> 32:17.823
everything you've been through.

32:17.825 --> 32:19.325
Then you find yourself
at the same place

32:19.327 --> 32:22.329
and you start
thinking about the act

32:22.331 --> 32:24.663
or acts that happened to you.

32:24.665 --> 32:27.066
I know that at
one point in time,

32:27.068 --> 32:29.768
the three of you have had
to have asked yourselves

32:29.770 --> 32:31.838
all of the obvious
questions like,

32:31.840 --> 32:34.073
"Why did this happen to me?

32:34.075 --> 32:36.612
"Did I do something to
bring this on myself?

32:37.778 --> 32:40.348
"Why didn't I resist
or fight harder?"

32:41.549 --> 32:43.882
And...

32:43.884 --> 32:48.123
"What sort of persons
could do this to someone?"

32:51.992 --> 32:54.393
But ask yourself
how long will it be

32:54.395 --> 32:56.632
until I start feeling
like myself again?

32:58.834 --> 33:03.005
How do I shake this
sadness, this darkness?

33:04.739 --> 33:07.476
Will I ever be able to
put this shit behind me?

33:10.612 --> 33:11.413
It's all normal.

33:13.715 --> 33:14.984
It is all normal.

33:16.384 --> 33:18.918
And that this group,
with time, can help

33:18.920 --> 33:21.688
you to get to that closure

33:21.690 --> 33:23.089
to be able to move on,

33:23.091 --> 33:25.925
to stop whatever's
holding you back.

33:25.927 --> 33:27.526
You forgot to mention
loss of appetite,

33:27.528 --> 33:29.562
that's probably the worst.

33:29.564 --> 33:31.096
You're right, I did.

33:31.098 --> 33:32.765
Loss of appetite is the worst.

33:32.767 --> 33:34.801
Loss of things in
general are common,

33:34.803 --> 33:37.970
though, loss of
appetite, loss of sleep,

33:37.972 --> 33:41.409
the loss of will to do
even the most basic things,

33:42.777 --> 33:44.744
the things that once
came to you second nature

33:44.746 --> 33:47.682
like going to the grocery
store, the library,

33:48.816 --> 33:49.815
it's too much.

33:49.817 --> 33:51.184
You can't do it.

33:51.186 --> 33:52.886
I know a lot of
members that have come

33:52.888 --> 33:53.852
and gone from this group

33:53.854 --> 33:55.655
and have lost their jobs

33:55.657 --> 33:57.424
because of the things
that have happened to them

33:57.426 --> 33:59.795
and their inability
to continue forth.

34:01.196 --> 34:03.530
What about dreams?

34:03.532 --> 34:04.997
Did you forgot those, too?

34:04.999 --> 34:07.132
No, bad dreams
are totally normal,

34:07.134 --> 34:08.002
completely common.

34:09.203 --> 34:11.638
Sometimes survivors
even relive the events

34:11.639 --> 34:13.743
that happened to
them in their dreams.

34:16.210 --> 34:19.047
Are you experiencing
something like that, Kayte?

34:20.649 --> 34:22.949
Not specifically,
I just wanted to know

34:22.951 --> 34:24.183
if dreams were part of it.

34:24.185 --> 34:25.585
Oh.

34:25.587 --> 34:30.126
Well, Leslie, Kevin,
do you have bad dreams?

34:31.125 --> 34:32.826
Yeah.

34:33.661 --> 34:34.496
Normal.

34:35.996 --> 34:36.831
Not alone.

34:38.766 --> 34:42.167
You know, after what you've
been through, though, Kayte,

34:42.168 --> 34:44.072
nothing is normal.

34:46.674 --> 34:48.842
Are you sure you don't
wanna talk about it?

34:49.877 --> 34:51.610
No, I'm fine.

34:51.612 --> 34:52.447
Okay.

34:53.947 --> 34:57.116
Every day is a step to
overcoming these obstacles,

34:57.118 --> 34:58.884
these things that
have been built

34:58.886 --> 35:01.856
up in your minds now because
of what you have been through,

35:03.024 --> 35:06.826
but with time, it is
through this group

35:06.828 --> 35:10.132
that you can heal and find
your closure and move on,

35:12.968 --> 35:17.973
so if anybody else has
nothing to share, Leslie?

35:19.640 --> 35:20.475
Kayte?

35:22.042 --> 35:22.877
Kevin?

35:24.245 --> 35:25.712
Well, then I'll let
y'all go for the night

35:25.714 --> 35:26.982
and I will see you next week.

35:43.031 --> 35:43.866
Shit.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.274
Hey, Kayte.

35:54.276 --> 35:57.743
It's Betsy, I just
got out of my meeting

35:57.745 --> 35:58.948
and the car won't start.

36:01.015 --> 36:03.084
I guess I'll walk.

36:08.089 --> 36:09.692
Bets, you got this.

39:49.310 --> 39:50.978
Fucking bloody nose.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.187
Oh my god.

40:21.341 --> 40:22.510
This is Sam.

40:25.346 --> 40:26.248
Yeah, what's going on?

40:29.216 --> 40:30.051
Another deer.

40:34.189 --> 40:35.857
Oh.

40:36.890 --> 40:38.826
Okay, where?

40:42.397 --> 40:45.100
All right, man, I'm on my way.

41:50.631 --> 41:51.897
Good morning.

41:51.899 --> 41:53.134
Good morning.

41:57.272 --> 41:58.407
What you making?

41:59.674 --> 42:01.243
Eggs.

42:02.143 --> 42:03.408
I just thought it'd be nice

42:03.410 --> 42:05.413
for you to wake up to
breakfast for a change.

42:06.314 --> 42:07.114
Huh.

42:08.348 --> 42:10.049
Okay.

42:10.051 --> 42:11.250
I just want you to know
how much I appreciate

42:11.252 --> 42:12.554
everything you've done for me.

42:15.256 --> 42:16.257
It's okay.

42:17.558 --> 42:19.328
Not a big deal.

42:21.196 --> 42:23.295
Came out to have a smoke
and take the trash out

42:23.297 --> 42:24.433
and there he was.

42:25.966 --> 42:27.266
What time you
think he found him?

42:27.268 --> 42:29.167
I don't know, right
when I went on break

42:29.169 --> 42:31.069
about nine o'clock.

42:31.071 --> 42:33.505
You have any
problem with animals?

42:33.507 --> 42:35.241
No.

42:35.243 --> 42:37.442
Like animals getting in
the dumpster or something?

42:37.444 --> 42:39.280
No, not that I know of.

42:42.616 --> 42:45.187
Stay right here,
I'll be right back.

42:49.991 --> 42:50.626
I don't know.

42:53.460 --> 42:55.995
Looks like it could
be though, right?

42:55.997 --> 42:57.263
What kind of
animal could do this?

42:57.265 --> 42:58.667
What would be big enough, a dog?

43:01.035 --> 43:02.467
Will you go get Sam?

43:02.469 --> 43:03.672
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

43:16.616 --> 43:19.484
Hey look, I gotta
tell you something.

43:19.486 --> 43:21.555
This is a potential
crime scene, okay,

43:22.756 --> 43:24.592
and I called you for
a couple of reasons.

43:26.227 --> 43:27.025
I just want you to know,
it's really fucking gross

43:27.027 --> 43:27.759
over there.

43:27.761 --> 43:29.395
Jesus Christ, Colin,

43:29.397 --> 43:30.998
is this a homicide
or an animal attack?

43:33.401 --> 43:35.368
You tell me.

43:45.046 --> 43:46.344
Jesus Christ, man, that's...

43:46.346 --> 43:48.517
Yeah, Walt Delaney,
piece of shit.

43:49.783 --> 43:51.250
That guy over there found him

43:51.252 --> 43:52.688
when he took out the
trash this morning.

43:57.457 --> 44:00.625
Well, it's definitely
an animal attack.

44:00.627 --> 44:01.794
You're positive?

44:01.796 --> 44:03.529
Oh, yeah.

44:03.531 --> 44:07.400
Well, it was definitely a
large canine type animal.

44:07.402 --> 44:08.268
You can tell from
the bite marks.

44:08.270 --> 44:10.205
There are some big
dogs around here.

44:11.571 --> 44:12.504
Maybe a pit bull?

44:12.506 --> 44:15.040
Or what about that Cane
Corso over on Maple?

44:15.042 --> 44:16.475
No.

44:16.477 --> 44:18.143
What about bobcats?

44:18.145 --> 44:20.346
I know you said something
about some bobcat sightings.

44:20.348 --> 44:21.513
It's too small.

44:21.515 --> 44:24.417
This animal is
definitely way larger

44:24.419 --> 44:25.650
than something that
would be hanging out

44:25.652 --> 44:27.585
by a dumpster, you
know what I mean?

44:27.587 --> 44:31.123
I'd learn towards a small
wolf to be honest with you.

44:31.125 --> 44:32.757
A wolf in Ohio?

44:32.759 --> 44:34.095
You're fucking with me.

44:37.397 --> 44:38.364
No.

44:38.366 --> 44:40.332
Like bobcats, they've
been sighted here too.

44:40.334 --> 44:43.201
In Michigan, in Kentucky.

44:43.203 --> 44:44.437
It's not out of the ordinary

44:44.439 --> 44:47.205
for being transient pack
animals like wolves are

44:47.207 --> 44:51.479
to travel long distances
to forage for food or prey.

44:52.712 --> 44:54.179
Fuck.

44:54.181 --> 44:55.281
This isn't good, Sam.

44:55.283 --> 44:57.583
Sorry, man, it's just
what it looks like to me.

44:57.585 --> 44:59.585
You call the coroner yet?

44:59.587 --> 45:02.120
Yeah, Bob's got a funeral.

45:02.122 --> 45:03.624
He'll be here in a little bit.

45:04.591 --> 45:05.426
Sup guys?

45:17.872 --> 45:19.707
Awe you look so good.

45:21.375 --> 45:22.741
Oh, you know what, though?

45:22.743 --> 45:24.109
What?

45:24.111 --> 45:25.310
Go into the bathroom

45:25.312 --> 45:28.179
and get that brown
headband that I have.

45:28.181 --> 45:29.183
Good idea.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.555
Aww.

45:37.524 --> 45:38.727
Sam's here.

45:46.433 --> 45:47.766
- Have fun.
- Bye.

45:47.768 --> 45:49.634
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

45:49.636 --> 45:50.805
Oh, shut up.

46:17.631 --> 46:18.732
Wow, this looks delicious.

46:20.667 --> 46:21.833
Would you like some wine?

46:21.835 --> 46:23.671
Yes, please.

46:44.692 --> 46:46.561
Go ahead, dig in.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.339
This chicken is delicious.

47:06.379 --> 47:08.282
So, how long you
been in Brookhaven?

47:09.649 --> 47:10.584
About three weeks now.

47:14.221 --> 47:16.557
Kayte and I's dad were
stationed together here.

47:18.859 --> 47:19.694
Army?

47:20.727 --> 47:21.562
Yep.

47:24.631 --> 47:25.900
So why'd you come back?

47:30.471 --> 47:31.339
If I tell you,

47:32.973 --> 47:35.709
you have to promise me not
to treat me any differently.

47:36.944 --> 47:37.946
Are you dying?

47:39.747 --> 47:40.712
No.

47:40.714 --> 47:42.350
Okay.

47:43.451 --> 47:44.753
I promise I won't treat
you any different.

47:50.558 --> 47:52.227
I was attacked
three weeks ago.

47:53.995 --> 47:55.728
I had scratches all over my body

47:55.730 --> 47:57.429
and there was blood everywhere,

47:57.431 --> 47:59.734
and when I woke up,
Kayte was there.

48:01.835 --> 48:04.002
Jesus.

48:04.004 --> 48:05.606
I'm really sorry.

48:06.506 --> 48:07.709
Really, that's terrible.

48:11.478 --> 48:15.517
Enough about me,
what about you?

48:19.020 --> 48:20.722
Other than my job,

48:22.022 --> 48:23.922
I don't really do much.

48:23.924 --> 48:26.324
I listen to the radio.

48:26.326 --> 48:27.328
I hunt.

48:28.728 --> 48:29.529
I play the harp,

48:30.931 --> 48:34.502
but I'm kind of a
homebody, I guess.

48:35.803 --> 48:36.671
I'm a homebody.

48:38.772 --> 48:39.705
At least now I am.

48:39.707 --> 48:40.605
Me and my friends do go out

48:40.607 --> 48:42.410
to the bar every once
in a while though.

48:44.477 --> 48:45.710
The cops that were
in the coffee shop

48:45.712 --> 48:46.745
the other day?

48:46.747 --> 48:47.381
Yeah.

48:49.817 --> 48:51.984
They're in there a lot lately.

48:51.986 --> 48:52.821
So are you.

48:54.754 --> 48:56.688
Only recently.

48:56.690 --> 48:57.890
Oh.

48:57.892 --> 48:59.893
Did you find a good
drink that you like?

49:02.462 --> 49:03.631
Something like that.

49:14.442 --> 49:16.044
Hey, honey.

49:16.777 --> 49:17.942
Are you all right?

49:17.944 --> 49:18.946
I heard about what
happened in town today.

49:19.879 --> 49:20.712
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:20.714 --> 49:22.484
Just doing some
research for my case.

49:23.718 --> 49:25.553
Ugh, wolves?

49:26.020 --> 49:26.921
That's weird.

49:29.989 --> 49:31.790
Did you know that
wolves will travel

49:31.792 --> 49:34.395
10 to 30 miles a day
just to search for food?

49:35.863 --> 49:37.732
Why are you
researching wolves?

49:38.866 --> 49:39.931
Well, it seems like
I'm dealing with,

49:39.933 --> 49:42.433
by what Sam says,

49:42.435 --> 49:43.437
an animal attack

49:44.739 --> 49:46.908
by a large canine.

49:48.609 --> 49:50.578
So like a wolf?

49:51.911 --> 49:54.480
That's what Sam thinks it is.

49:54.482 --> 49:55.784
But what do you think it is?

49:57.685 --> 50:02.154
Just because it
never has happened here

50:02.156 --> 50:04.392
doesn't mean it
couldn't happen here,

50:05.459 --> 50:06.828
but I don't know.

50:07.861 --> 50:11.632
Plus the victim was
missing his pants.

50:12.399 --> 50:13.367
That's weird.

50:14.033 --> 50:15.536
Yeah, it's suspect, right?

50:17.872 --> 50:20.471
I think it could have been
a human that did this.

50:20.473 --> 50:21.207
Really?

50:22.910 --> 50:27.779
Jill, he was just
torn to shreds,

50:27.781 --> 50:29.647
just bad.

50:29.649 --> 50:31.985
Oh my gosh, can you
tell me who it was?

50:33.053 --> 50:33.888
Walt Delaney.

50:36.189 --> 50:37.358
Well, I mean,

50:38.359 --> 50:40.859
one of those girls could
have gotten back at him.

50:40.861 --> 50:41.830
Serves him right.

50:44.799 --> 50:46.198
Yeah.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.466
Walt Delaney's a strong guy.

50:47.468 --> 50:48.933
I don't think it was a woman.

50:48.935 --> 50:50.805
I'm not really
concerned with him.

50:52.473 --> 50:54.540
What I'm concerned with
is that there's something

50:54.542 --> 50:57.542
or someone doing
this in my city.

50:57.544 --> 50:58.544
I can't have that.

50:58.546 --> 51:01.946
Yeah, that's so weird.

51:01.948 --> 51:04.882
I'm gonna go take a
drive and clear my head.

51:04.884 --> 51:06.551
Okay.

51:06.553 --> 51:08.085
Don't be gone long, okay?

51:08.087 --> 51:09.955
- I won't.
- All right.

51:09.957 --> 51:10.755
I love you.

51:10.757 --> 51:12.993
I love you, too.

51:20.835 --> 51:22.900
Do you mind if I
put some music on?

51:22.902 --> 51:23.937
Go for it.

53:04.939 --> 53:05.973
Hey, chief.

53:07.241 --> 53:08.676
How's it going?

53:11.111 --> 53:12.212
It's just not right.

53:14.013 --> 53:15.582
What's not right?

53:19.620 --> 53:20.255
A wolf.

53:23.022 --> 53:24.191
Traveling all the way here

53:25.658 --> 53:26.627
and killing a man.

53:31.966 --> 53:34.569
Couldn't it have
found some other prey

53:35.935 --> 53:38.305
in between here and wherever
the hell it came from?

53:39.172 --> 53:41.542
Well, couldn't Sam be wrong?

53:44.044 --> 53:45.946
Coroner came to
the same conclusion.

53:48.848 --> 53:50.751
Those hair samples
that we collected,

53:51.852 --> 53:53.288
they were fur samples.

53:55.022 --> 53:56.123
A fucking wolf.

53:57.625 --> 53:59.027
A fucking wolf.

54:57.685 --> 54:59.216
You good to drive, chief?

54:59.218 --> 55:01.085
Oh, yeah, I'm just tired.

55:01.087 --> 55:03.187
Okay, have a good night.

55:03.189 --> 55:04.056
Yeah, you too.

55:04.058 --> 55:05.457
See you tomorrow.

55:05.459 --> 55:06.661
Hey, wait.

55:08.062 --> 55:09.960
Why didn't it eat the guy?

55:09.962 --> 55:10.765
What?

55:11.966 --> 55:16.069
Sam said wolves travel great
distances to hunt and eat.

55:17.236 --> 55:18.937
And?

55:18.939 --> 55:21.038
It didn't eat the
guy, just killed him.

55:21.040 --> 55:23.841
Why wouldn't it have eaten him?

55:23.843 --> 55:25.145
I'll see you in the morning.

55:26.747 --> 55:28.279
All right, have a good night.

55:28.281 --> 55:29.816
See you tomorrow.

59:59.453 --> 01:00:01.088
Hey, Betsy, it's Sam.

01:00:02.288 --> 01:00:07.294
I didn't hear you leave
this morning, so...

01:00:09.562 --> 01:00:11.529
I just wanted to let you know

01:00:11.531 --> 01:00:13.301
I had a really good
time last night

01:00:14.368 --> 01:00:17.203
and I hope everything's
all right, so...

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.475
When you get this,
just give me a call.

01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:46.587
Jill, what's wrong?

01:02:47.319 --> 01:02:47.555
Sam, it's so awful.

01:02:49.256 --> 01:02:51.788
Colin called, Dusty's dead.

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:53.493
Wait, what, no.

01:02:54.627 --> 01:02:56.294
The wolf attacked him.

01:02:56.296 --> 01:02:57.531
Jill, where's Colin?

01:02:58.665 --> 01:03:01.199
In the woods, outside of town.

01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:02.799
- Is he in danger?
- I gotta go.

01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:04.268
I'll call him from my truck.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:05.772
Get this door locked
and stay inside.

01:05:03.689 --> 01:05:05.291
So she's...

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:07.895
There.

01:05:10.629 --> 01:05:11.464
But...

01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:16.237
Fuck it.

01:07:18.924 --> 01:07:19.727
Betsy?

01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.831
Colin.

01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:25.833
What the fuck are
you doing out here?

01:07:26.765 --> 01:07:26.866
Colin, it's Betsy.

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:28.833
What's Betsy?

01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:30.134
Betsy's responsible
for all of this.

01:07:30.136 --> 01:07:31.536
What do you mean?

01:07:31.538 --> 01:07:31.805
I thought you said
it was a wolf.

01:07:32.939 --> 01:07:34.942
If you trust me on anything,
please let this be it.

01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:39.710
All right.

01:07:47.085 --> 01:07:47.921
Betsy!

01:08:06.872 --> 01:08:07.907
Betsy!

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.113
Betsy.

01:08:18.017 --> 01:08:19.452
Betsy, it's okay.

01:08:19.986 --> 01:08:22.689
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.469
Colin, no!

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:45.612
This is Sam Harper.

01:08:46.946 --> 01:08:48.582
I'm about a mile
off Snyder Road.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:51.948
Chief Rogers is down.

01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:53.220
I've got two more bodies here.

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:54.886
Stay on the line with dispatch.

01:08:54.888 --> 01:08:56.051
They're coming to help.

01:08:56.054 --> 01:08:57.122
Wait.

01:08:58.055 --> 01:08:59.788
Don't go after her.

01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:00.892
Sam!

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:45.104
Hold me.

01:09:53.679 --> 01:09:55.615
Such a beautiful smile.

01:09:58.216 --> 01:09:59.219
So do you.

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:13.065
Betsy?

01:10:13.966 --> 01:10:15.067
Sorry, Sam.

01:14:27.353 --> 01:14:30.257
Hey, can I help you?

01:14:34.559 --> 01:14:35.193
Excuse me?

01:14:36.261 --> 01:14:38.098
That's my car you're leaning on.

01:14:42.568 --> 01:14:43.403
What?

01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:46.203
You're fucking dead.

01:14:47.239 --> 01:14:48.371
No.

01:14:48.373 --> 01:14:49.376
You're dead.

01:15:15.268 --> 01:15:17.337
Welcome to the club, Kayte.
