[music playing]

00:54.522 --> 00:56.990
DARLENE: Oh, you wanted to help
her because I had you beat.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.025
DAN: Yeah, right.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.160
DARLENE: Come on.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.029
I had you by five points
till the buzzer came on.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.164
I've got to go, Dianne.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.865
The rent's just came in.

01:04.898 --> 01:05.833
No way.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.268
Tell me.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.469
What did you buy me?

01:08.502 --> 01:09.370
Nothing.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.971
Get out of there.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.806
Dad, I think you should
put a light outside,

01:12.840 --> 01:14.875
so we can play
basketball at night.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.145
You know, you've got
a light on your desk,

01:17.178 --> 01:19.847
so you can do your homework.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.817
Don't do that in
the house, Darlene.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.219
Darlene, set the table.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.820
I'll do it.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.789
Go ahead, Mr. Suck-Up.

01:28.822 --> 01:32.126
Nobody buys your
goody-goody act.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.595
Mommy buys it.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.264
Hey, you know what, kid?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.566
It could be pretty close
there Friday night.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.767
No way.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.169
Jordon is unstoppable.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.470
I don't know.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.738
Things get pretty hairy with
Fat Level at point guard.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.006
Oh, please.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.141
What's a point guard?

01:47.175 --> 01:48.041
Forget it.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.178
Mom, I can't reach the plates.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.012
Big game Friday night, baby.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.314
What kind of game?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.416
Basketball, hoops, b-ball.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.386
Pulses race as
the towering Chicago

01:58.419 --> 02:01.789
Bulls take on the wimpy,
sponge-like Denver Nuggets.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.690
Be there!

02:02.723 --> 02:03.991
Pay me.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.694
Mom, I can't
reach the glasses.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.697
How can someone not
appreciate basketball?

02:09.730 --> 02:12.300
Well, it's easy.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.435
You just slouch on the
sofa next to your husband.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.036
You watch these guys run
up and down the court

02:16.069 --> 02:17.638
a couple hundred times.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.373
And then it becomes
almost hypnotic.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.741
You get really bored.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.344
You're sitting there
thinking, wait a minute.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.246
I have no life.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.515
This message was not
brought to you by the National

02:27.548 --> 02:29.149
Basketball Association.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.319
I think I'm going out
with Jimmy on Friday night.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.788
Talk about having no life.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.225
Yeah, I bet you have
some real major plans.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.193
I'm watching
the game with Dad.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.961
Ah, the son I never had.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.396
Hey, I'm watching
the game, too!

02:42.430 --> 02:45.266
OK.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.135
Honey, I invited a few of
the fellows over Friday night.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.204
Yeah, are you asking
me or telling me?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.104
Oh, come on.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.039
It's an occasion.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.741
Well, let's break
out the Harvey's

02:53.774 --> 02:55.909
Bristol Cream, shall we?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.110
What time's the kickoff?

02:57.144 --> 03:00.113
Tip-off is at 7 o'clock.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.649
Well, you ain't going
to watch it anyways,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.784
Darlene, until you do
your homework, remember?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.018
We had this discussion.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.288
Yeah, but this
is a Friday night.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.690
Since when do I have to do my
homework on a Friday night?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.625
Since I got your
last report card.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.126
Well, the only
homework I'm going

03:13.160 --> 03:14.395
to have to do this
weekend is to write

03:14.428 --> 03:16.029
a stupid poem for English.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.498
Well, you can write a poem.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.633
Yeah, but it has to be stupid.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.702
Oh, knock it off, you guys.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.804
Anyways, writing poetry
is kind of fun, you know.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.707
You get to be creative
and expressive.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.042
I don't want to be expressive.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.211
I couldn't care
less about poetry.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.580
I just want to
graduate high school,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.482
so I can get on with my
life, so I can get a job

03:34.515 --> 03:37.985
and get out of this
hell-hole town.

03:38.018 --> 03:42.423
But if you could be
expressive, what would you say?

03:42.456 --> 03:45.726
[music playing]

03:50.197 --> 03:53.501
Hey, how are you doing
there, Sylvia Plath?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.469
Who's Sylvia Plath?

03:55.503 --> 03:59.273
Oh, she was this brilliant
poet full of passion,

03:59.307 --> 04:01.809
angst, and whatever.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.212
She inspired quite a
few women, like moi.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.047
Uh-oh, what's that?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.883
Well, I was in the garage,
and I went to this trunk.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.686
And I found all these poems
I wrote when I was in school.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.154
I thought maybe it'd help you.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.055
Help?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.590
You saved me.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.625
So which one should I copy?

04:17.658 --> 04:18.526
Hey.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.729
Ow.

04:21.762 --> 04:29.269
The sky drips down
like dragon's teeth.

04:29.303 --> 04:35.443
The Earth sighs,
bending to my touch.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.844
I am melting.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.251
Mm, you had to be there.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.455
Well, I guess
"there" must mean Mars.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.189
Well, there's
other poems in there

04:49.222 --> 04:51.459
that aren't quite so earthy.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.826
Why'd you write these?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.928
Because I wanted to.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.031
Well, I can't write
about this kind of stuff.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.134
What do you mean?

05:01.168 --> 05:05.138
Write a poem about something
that gives you a happy feeling.

05:05.172 --> 05:12.079
For example, a tree, a
rainbow, your [scoffs] family.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.214
Well, you can write
about whatever you want.

05:14.247 --> 05:18.919
Yeah, as long as it
gives me a happy feeling.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.389
Oh, come off it, Darlene.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.090
Just 'cause your
teacher's a little wet

05:23.123 --> 05:25.559
doesn't mean that
all poetry stinks.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.461
Anyway, poetry is really cool.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.697
I-- I loved to write it
when I was in school.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.200
Well, yeah, but
you were a nerd.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.002
I was not a nerd.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.938
Dad said, you were
a nerd in school.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.409
Well, consider the source.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.411
Anyway, what do you think about
these people like, you know,

05:43.444 --> 05:46.980
Edie Brickell or Chrissy
Hynde or Rickie Lee Jones?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.115
You think they're nerds?

05:48.148 --> 05:50.418
I get the point.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.986
So what would make you happy?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.254
I don't know.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.790
A tree.

05:56.824 --> 06:00.193
[music playing]

06:01.261 --> 06:02.730
Now I just don't get it.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.197
Writing is something
that Darlene could

06:04.231 --> 06:05.733
be really, really good at.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.668
I mean, she's
expressive, you know.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.136
She's creative.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.204
She has pencils.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.106
[telephone rings]

06:14.675 --> 06:16.910
Hello?
Hey, Joey.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.712
It's Joey L.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.080
Joey, what's the word?

06:20.113 --> 06:23.551
Are you coming over here to
watch the game tomorrow night?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.318
Hey, just tell your wife--

06:25.352 --> 06:26.219
one second.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.956
Let me take this in the hall.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.091
So where's you and
what's-his-face going

06:31.124 --> 06:31.992
on Friday?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.126
Out.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.896
Oh, well, you'll
have a real good time.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.432
Your daddy and I used to
go there all the time.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.333
Are you going to sit here
with Dad and watch the game?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.436
Uh-uh, Aunt
Jackie's coming over.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.638
What are you guys going to do?

06:44.672 --> 06:47.074
Drink beer, and
shoot at mailboxes.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.375
Cool.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.643
Great.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.844
I'll reserve the
blue chair for you.

06:50.878 --> 06:51.845
[sarcastic laughter]

06:51.879 --> 06:52.746
[doorbell rings]

06:52.780 --> 06:54.648
I'll get it.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.649
All right.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.717
Break it to me gently.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.618
How many?

06:57.651 --> 06:58.919
Five, six tops.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.155
Now you understand I'm
not talking about their IQs.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.525
I'm talking about the
number of your nasty friends

07:04.558 --> 07:06.193
that are going to be in
my living room on Friday.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.696
Honey, it's just
a couple of friends.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.097
We'll be civilized.
I promise.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.231
Civilized?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.866
Yeah, this time we'll
cook the woolly mammoth

07:12.900 --> 07:14.334
before we eat it.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.969
Hello, hello, hello.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.337
Hi, Crystal.

07:17.370 --> 07:23.544
I finally got that eyeshadow
you ordered, Violet Ice.

07:23.577 --> 07:27.915
Oh, so that's where you and
Jimmy are going-- to Vegas.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.282
I'll be right back.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.218
I got something
for you, too, Dan.

07:31.251 --> 07:35.088
Now, Crystal, you know I
rarely wear eyeshadow anymore.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.025
Boys on the job site give
me such guff about it.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.860
Now stop.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.761
Here you go.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.231
Ooh, Stallion.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.666
He don't need that, Crystal.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.836
He already smells like a
horse, don't you, honey?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.070
[nickering]

07:51.705 --> 07:53.240
What'd you bring me?

07:53.273 --> 07:56.710
Oh, best bath beads
made with real milk.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.778
Well, great.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.279
Then when I'm soaking
and I get hungry,

07:59.312 --> 08:00.313
I'll just add some Cheerios.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.486
Roseanne, I got something
I want to read you.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.756
It's a poem that Lonnie
wrote for school.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.525
I just thought you'd
get a kick out of it.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.662
My Mom, by Lonnie Anderson.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.531
"My mom thinks about me
first and herself last.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.233
When I'm getting dressed,
she makes me breakfast.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.836
She puts me on the
bus and combs my hair.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.105
And when I'm at school,
she isn't there.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.407
But she's at home
when I get back.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.443
For making dinner,
she has a knack.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.313
It's nice when she puts me
in bed because it's late,

08:33.346 --> 08:34.147
and I'm tire-ed.

08:39.152 --> 08:43.190
I love my mom, and I'm glad
that she's my mom and not

08:43.223 --> 08:44.925
somebody else or something."

08:49.830 --> 08:51.565
Ain't that the sweetest
thing you ever heard?

08:51.599 --> 08:53.033
I think it's great.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.403
Oh, well, it's terrible, but
it's just so sweet, isn't it?

08:56.436 --> 08:58.171
It's adorable.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.172
Here you go, Crystal.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.073
Ah!

09:00.107 --> 09:01.008
$3.50, right?

09:01.041 --> 09:04.144
Thank you, honey.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.581
So where is your
little poetic genius?

09:07.615 --> 09:08.916
What are you talking about?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.250
Why, Darlene, silly.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.151
Didn't you hear yet?

09:11.184 --> 09:12.285
Hear what?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.988
Well, maybe I ought
to let Darlene tell you.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.123
Come on, Crystal.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.126
Darlene's poem got
picked best in her class.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.894
She's going to read it for
the school tomorrow night.

09:20.928 --> 09:21.795
It's culture night.

09:21.829 --> 09:22.830
You're kidding.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.398
How come Darlene
didn't say anything?

09:25.432 --> 09:27.200
I hope I didn't
spoil the surprise.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.537
Darlene, will you come
down here for a minute?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.371
Sweetie!

09:34.708 --> 09:36.109
Well, she finally
does good in school,

09:36.143 --> 09:37.544
she doesn't even
tell us about it.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.713
Probably still in shock.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.948
What?

09:40.981 --> 09:45.585
Look, look, it's the famous
person as a young child.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.320
How come you didn't tell us?

09:47.354 --> 09:49.489
Crystal, you have a big mouth.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.958

09:56.596 --> 09:59.266
This is exactly the reason
I'm not going to culture night.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.401
What, are you
ashamed of your talent?

10:01.434 --> 10:05.205
No, I'm ashamed of my parents.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.439
Well, so is everybody.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.208
It's supposed to be like that.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.010
Mom, I'm not going.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.144
You've got to say I'm sick.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.612
But why wouldn't
you want to go?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.447
I mean, this is your shot.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.349
This is like winning
the big game.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.886
Mom, you can't make me go.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.788
And if you try and make
me read my poem in front

10:20.821 --> 10:23.356
of the geekoid masses, you'll
have to throw a net around me

10:23.390 --> 10:25.192
and drag me out of the
house like a dead seal.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.329
Where are you going?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.263
To get the net.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.268
[music playing]

10:35.302 --> 10:39.339
You know, I think you're just
being pigheaded about this.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.375
Well, I think you're being
pigheaded about it, Roseanne.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.144
You know, you're starting
to sound like my dad-- work

10:44.177 --> 10:45.412
smart, Danny, not hard.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.014
Be a salesman.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.115
I'm not-- I'm not
going to do it.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.349
I'm going to push
our kids like that.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.784
Well, I don't want to, either.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.820
Well, then what's the
big deal about making

10:52.853 --> 10:54.654
Darlene read this stupid poem?

10:54.688 --> 10:59.192
It is called positive
reinforcement, Dan.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.762
You know, if just once, if my
parents were to ever told me,

11:01.795 --> 11:03.330
hey, Roseanne,
you're good at that,

11:03.363 --> 11:07.367
I might be standing in front of
you right now mopping a bigger,

11:07.400 --> 11:08.869
more luxurious kitchen.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.209
I-- it's wet!

11:16.243 --> 11:17.477
Go use the phone in my room.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.545
I'm talking to your dad.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.747
I don't need to use the phone.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.983
Oh, let me get that on tape.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.517
You know, I really don't
think you should make

11:24.551 --> 11:25.986
Darlene go to culture night.
- Oh, yeah?

11:26.019 --> 11:26.887
And why is that?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.989
Because it's totally geeky.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.323
I mean, you know what it's like.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.993
There's paintings, the school
band, readings, and stuff.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.561
Oh, you mean like art.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.830
Yeah, but strictly
the bow tie set.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.265
I mean, everyone's
going to think Darlene's

11:38.298 --> 11:39.800
a big suck-up if she goes.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.401
Why, thank you, Ms. Conner.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.336
No further questions.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.373
You can tell your client she
can get herself a new attorney.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.108
So you're going
to make her go?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.709
Nobody's making
anybody do anything.

11:49.743 --> 11:50.610
Great.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.511
I'll tell her.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.881
Becky, mind your own business.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.315
If you really want to
help out around here,

11:55.348 --> 11:56.583
just stay out of it.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.517
Fine.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.618
If you don't care
about your kids,

11:58.651 --> 12:00.888
I guess there's
nothing I can do.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.789
She didn't buy it, Darlene.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.191
You were terrible.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.794
I'm just getting fed up.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.062
We owe it to Darlene
to make her do this.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.330
And she's doing it.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.932
Oh, that's funny because
I thought Darlene had two

12:11.965 --> 12:14.001
parents, and this was a
decision that both of them

12:14.034 --> 12:15.068
should be involved in.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.537
Well, look, OK, we
obviously disagree,

12:17.570 --> 12:19.539
and we have to come to
some kind of a decision.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.309
And one of us is
going to be wrong.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.045
Now you just give me the
chance to be wrong this time.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.249
Look, no matter
what we do, we're

12:29.282 --> 12:32.719
going to screw our kids up.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.855
You let me mess up Darlene,
and you can have Becky.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.093
What about DJ?

12:40.127 --> 12:43.897
We'll flip for it.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.267
[music playing]

13:00.047 --> 13:03.716
You know, this whole
thing is Ms. Miller's fault.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.953
If I'd known anyone else
was going to see this poem,

13:05.986 --> 13:07.287
I never would have written it.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.355
I haven't seen it.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.023
You're not gonna.

13:10.057 --> 13:16.997
No, but I am going to hear it
being read live and on stage.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.732
Please, Mom, I'm begging you.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.302
I'll clean whatever
you want me to clean.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.537
I just really, really, really,
really, really, really,

13:24.571 --> 13:26.840
really, really, really, really,
really, don't want to do this.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.909
Really?

13:28.942 --> 13:32.079
Come on, Mom.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.513
I wrote the poem, OK?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.282
I did my assignment.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.950
Why can't we just
leave it at that?

13:36.984 --> 13:39.186
What are you so afraid of?

13:39.219 --> 13:42.022
I'm not afraid of anything.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.624
Well, you just give
me one good reason.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.260
You give me the truth, and
maybe I won't make you do it.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.661
The truth?

13:48.695 --> 13:54.367
Yeah, you know, the opposite
of what you usually tell me.

13:54.401 --> 13:58.505
Truth is my poem sucks.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.945
I wrote it in like 10 minutes.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.846
I just blabbed it out
on a piece of paper.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.851
It's just a joke.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.720
Ms. Miller doesn't think so.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.822
Well, Mr. Miller's an idiot.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.224
The only reason
she picked my poem

14:17.257 --> 14:19.559
is because she thought
it would encourage me.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.628
You know, I'm really
surprised at you, Darlene.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.663
What's everybody going to
think if you don't show up?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.465
Who cares what
everybody thinks?

14:25.498 --> 14:27.067
Well, if you don't care
what everybody thinks,

14:27.100 --> 14:28.035
then what are you so afraid of?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.041
Dan, come here quick!

14:34.074 --> 14:35.042
Darlene's speechless!

14:35.075 --> 14:36.476
You've got to see this.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.916
You know what I think?

14:42.950 --> 14:46.419
What?

14:46.453 --> 14:47.787
I think--

14:51.158 --> 14:56.563
I think you're afraid that
your poem really is good.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.165
I think you're afraid
to let everybody see

14:58.198 --> 14:59.532
that you've got a
brain because then

14:59.566 --> 15:01.801
they'll expect you to use it.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.336
Yeah, right.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.105
I'm so surprised at you.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.639
I mean, your whole life,
you're running around

15:06.673 --> 15:08.775
to take all the credit for
everything you've done wrong,

15:08.808 --> 15:10.710
And now something
really great happens.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.945
Don't you want to enjoy it?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.580
Don't you want to get up
there, and take your bow?

15:16.649 --> 15:17.517
No.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.786
Well, fine.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.354
You do what you want.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.356
I just thought I'd get a
little joy out of it, you know,

15:23.390 --> 15:24.791
a few goosebumps.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.026
I'd be proud of you.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.361
But I don't want you to
do it just because you

15:28.395 --> 15:30.697
think you owe it to me.

15:30.730 --> 15:31.864
OK, I won't.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.366
Oh, but you are doing it.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.434
Why?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.803
Because I'm your
mother, and I said so.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.871
Oh, that's fair.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.340
So what if I freak out?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.642
What if I faint and crack
my head open on stage?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.711
Well, then everybody
will be able to see

15:44.744 --> 15:47.147
that you've got a brain.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.106
How are you doing?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.175
Well, I'll tel you, Darlene.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.976
I'm not really into
this high pressure,

16:17.010 --> 16:18.611
high visibility stuff.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.613
I'm really more of a recluse.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.614
You want to get some punch.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.515
Yeah.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.316

- Hi.
- Hi.

16:37.964 --> 16:38.998
You made it.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.968
Oh, Roseanne, this
place still scares me.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.905
Yeah, we better take our seats
unless they make us stay after.

16:45.938 --> 16:46.906
Where's Dan?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.841

probably despise you right now.

But I y-- you did
what you had to do.

still loves her Aunt Jackie.

how could I fight this?

my pain is quite real.

but it really burns.
