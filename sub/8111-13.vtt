Let's get back to
Phil and Diane.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.000
Phil's been having a
hard time finding work,

00:11.095 --> 00:14.587
and Diane wants him to
talk to her about his fear,
his disappointment.

00:15.224 --> 00:19.558
And Phil wants Diane to
trust him, that they'll get
through this,

00:19.645 --> 00:22.933
ideally without
having to keep
discussing feelings.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.477
Not your exact words,
but am I wrong?

00:26.444 --> 00:29.151
And most guys out there
are the same way.

00:29.238 --> 00:34.574
But, ladies,
if you're feeling
frustrated, remember,

00:34.660 --> 00:35.866
it's not our fault.

00:36.329 --> 00:40.038
We were raised to be
strong, not emotional,

00:40.333 --> 00:43.370
to deny vulnerability,
not embrace it.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.747
And you know
what that makes us?

00:46.464 --> 00:48.125
Dinosaurs.
(CROWD LAUGHS)

00:48.466 --> 00:51.378
Nobody needs us to
hunt wild animals
for food.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.669
Nobody needs us
to cut down trees
to build shelter.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.553
They need us to evolve.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.222
To catch up.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.430
Since the 1960s,
women's roles have
shifted radically.

01:08.903 --> 01:12.066
(STUTTERING)
And as their roles
have changed,

01:12.156 --> 01:13.896
so have women.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.573
Well, they've become tougher,

01:16.661 --> 01:19.277
more demanding of us,
their partners.

01:19.372 --> 01:22.034
And who can blame them?
Who can...

01:22.959 --> 01:24.324
Who can...

01:24.794 --> 01:26.785
For expecting us to

01:38.516 --> 01:40.427

02:19.015 --> 02:20.471
JESSICA: Your limp's
almost gone.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.932
lt pains me to interrupt
the collegial banter.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.261
lt pains me even more
to listen to it continue.

38-year-old man spikes a fever
and collapses during a
speaking engagement.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.733
ER checks out blood volume,

02:32.862 --> 02:35.729
cardiac function and
autonomic reflexes.
All normal.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.565
Our patient makes a
living telling men to behave
more like women.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.366
Surprised you didn't throw
psych symptoms
into the differential.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.285
Either way, could be
a cerebral AVM.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.829
ER did a head CT,
no sign of AVM.

02:45.916 --> 02:46.951
Decent thought, though.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.083
The patient's philosophy
makes perfect sense.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.756
Its only flaw is
that it's impossible.

02:53.049 --> 02:56.416
Evolution doesn't work
that way. You can't talk
legs onto a fish.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.380
If we're gonna go extinct,
we're gonna do it

Am I right?

Am I... Thank you.

03:06.729 --> 03:10.142
Cephalic fibromuscular
dysplasia?
Doesn't explain the fever.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.018
The patient's talking
about compromise.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.476
If you don't think that's
possible, you don't think
relationships are possible.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.687
Anyone in this room
in a position
to disprove that?

He could have a
pulmonary embolism.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.325
Clot in his lung
increases right
ventricular afterload,

03:27.416 --> 03:28.656
drops the blood
flow to his brain.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.116
We should do a
pulmonary angiogram.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.247
Patient lacks major
risk factors for a PE.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.541
Doesn't rule it out,
just makes it unlikely.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.624
Maybe we start with a D-dimer?
Less invasive than
the angiogram.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.753
Good idea.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.007
Fine.

You're right.

had a near-fatal stabbing.

Well, if it isn't the
old ball and Ukraine.

is in four days.

They ask questions
about marriage,

vacations, family history,
what side of the bed
each sleep on.

04:53.377 --> 04:57.040
We've never taken a vacation,
I don't like your family,
and on top.

I hear Kiev is lovely

And your mother, who may or
may not be dead for all
I know, misses you.

Can it be that genius doctor
is afraid to take on a silly
government apparatchik?

05:10.478 --> 05:13.891
I would say more not
interested than afraid,
but why quibble?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.016
Then I go to plan B.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.729
Make you an offer that
cannot be refused.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.403
How long have you
been doing seminars?

05:36.587 --> 05:37.702
It's okay. I get it.

big wake-up call courtesy
of three drunks

outside a sports bar
in Milwaukee.

05:47.264 --> 05:50.176
I'm guessing that explains
the broken wrist in
your medical history.

biggest favor of my life.

back down from an
argument over football.

Meeting Marlene

in the puzzle.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.195

my diet.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.273
She gave me a whole
new direction in life.

06:09.411 --> 06:13.404
We'll need to know exactly
how you changed your
diet and when.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.200
Need my apartment key back.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.037
If you're breaking up
with me, can we at least
talk about it first?

06:21.131 --> 06:23.622
Maybe if you weren't
all nag and no shag...

06:24.969 --> 06:27.210
I don't sleep
with married men.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.130
I'll get a copy made.
You're an ex-con.
If you get caught

06:31.267 --> 06:34.976
perjuring yourself to
Homeland Security, you'll end
up back in jail.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.395
That'd be troubling if
there was the slightest chance
that we'd get caught.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.814
You barely know each other
and you've got about
five minutes

06:40.901 --> 06:43.392
to remake yourselves
into a convincing
married couple.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.398
And why?

06:45.489 --> 06:48.481
Dominika gets her green card.
What's in this for you?

06:48.576 --> 06:51.488
This is what men do
for the women they
pretend to love.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.488
Also she's paying me
30,000 bucks once
we pass.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.081
Apparently, knishes
sell like hotcakes.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.669

to finish your nag later.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.584
I said I think it's
stupid, right?

07:05.009 --> 07:06.965
Then I think I'm done.

07:09.597 --> 07:13.340
D-dimer came back
normal. Rules out
pulmonary embolism.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.176
And our patient's a
true believer about the
follies of masculinity.

07:16.312 --> 07:19.019
He underwent a spiritual
overhaul three years ago.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.763
He also went off gluten
and red meat.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.270
Unfortunately,
that doesn't explain
any of his symptoms.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.442
One of those points
is not absurd.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.769
What's absurd about
a change of heart?

07:26.864 --> 07:29.355
What this guy believes
is making him
a better person.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.190
He's going against
his baser instincts.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.116
Base, meaning
foundational,

07:33.203 --> 07:36.036
meaning things
we're biologically
programmed to do.

07:36.165 --> 07:40.534
Yeah, it's perfectly
natural that he stopped
doing that stuff.

07:40.669 --> 07:44.378

that could take you out of

okay with that.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.506
I'm in.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.887
You don't want to do that.
You might need your
dignity later in life.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.638
You didn't.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.310
And she could be on her way
to living the dream

08:00.397 --> 08:03.730
unless the rest of you
nut up and give her...

08:06.570 --> 08:09.983
This spiritual overhaul.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.406
Did it come after a
physical overhaul?

08:12.493 --> 08:14.324
A major injury
of some kind?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.400
TAUB: Bar fight.

08:15.537 --> 08:19.655
But there's no way a
broken wrist explains...
Adams, come with me.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.832
You, too.

08:21.919 --> 08:25.082
You guys get a
copy of that made.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.045

bend your ball-sack
like Beckham?

08:34.932 --> 08:36.342
Three years ago.
The bar fight.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.924
This is Dr. House.
He has a theory.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.018
Dr. Adams,
would you mind?

08:48.278 --> 08:51.406
| asked you a question.
I assume you know the answer.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.948
Yeah. I took a couple of
serious knees
to the groin.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.192
But what...

08:56.286 --> 08:58.026
What has gotten into me?

08:58.414 --> 08:59.870
Dr. Chase.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.452
Just pick it up.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.797
Do you know what's
wrong with me?

09:08.132 --> 09:12.592
Nothing that the Golden Girls
couldn't have handled
in 23 hilarious minutes.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.300
You had a hot flash.

09:15.097 --> 09:18.430
Those guys kicked your
guys hard enough to
do lasting damage.

09:18.642 --> 09:23.136
You didn't even look when
presented with two reasonably
attractive tuchi.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.061
Yeah, I said it.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.480
l was listening
to my doctor.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.059
People generally listen
with their ears, leaving their
eyes free to wander.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.733
I'm guessing that your
testosterone level is
just below Bieber.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.824
Do a blood test
to confirm, then start
hormone replacement.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.326
It's no wonder
that you think women
are so great.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.745
You've basically been one
for the last three years.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.912
TAUB: Tests confirmed
House was right.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.835
Low testosterone explains
all your symptoms.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.080
They should go away
with replacement therapy.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.915
We're gonna give you
a fairly high dose.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.001
Over time, your personal
physician may reduce
it a little.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.172
Just need you
to turn around.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.339
Will the shots increase
his libido?

10:00.434 --> 10:01.594
Are you worried
about that?

10:01.685 --> 10:02.970
No.

10:05.856 --> 10:10.020
Have you been unsatisfied?
No. No, it'sjust...

10:10.152 --> 10:12.438
It's usually me that
initiates things.

10:12.863 --> 10:18.028
Sometimes I think
maybe you aren't
that attracted to me.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.240
Are you crazy?

10:19.703 --> 10:23.616
With these injections,
you will see an increase
in sex drive.

10:23.707 --> 10:24.913
Great.
Yeah.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.218
All done.
Okay.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.222
(GASPS) Something's wrong.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.594
I think I peed myself.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.057
Is that from
the testosterone?

10:44.186 --> 10:48.020
Couldn't be.
I don't think you're
going home just yet.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.231
CHASE: It's not a plumbing
problem. Means it's
probably neurological.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.729
And?

10:59.076 --> 11:02.284
And name Dominika's
three brothers.

11:05.457 --> 11:09.621
Volodymyr, Oleksiy and...

11:11.588 --> 11:12.577
(GROANS)

11:12.798 --> 11:14.914
The low testosterone
is off the table
as a symptom.

11:15.092 --> 11:18.300
Guy got his nuts cracked three
years ago. Don't need to look
much further than that.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.760
So his hose just happens
to spring a leak

11:20.889 --> 11:25.599
at the same time he's in
the hospital for a totally
unrelated problem?

11:25.727 --> 11:27.854
Fjodor.
lt's Fedir.

11:27.938 --> 11:31.055
If low testosterone means
I can't get sick with
something else,

11:31.149 --> 11:33.105
then punch me in
the junk right now.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.521
I would if it
weren't redundant.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.898
ls Fedir the one
who married Mykola?

11:37.990 --> 11:41.733
Mykola is Dominika's uncle.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.864
How is it you can retain
every detail of our habits
and personal lives

11:44.955 --> 11:46.786
and none of this?

11:46.915 --> 11:49.531
I find it hard to remember
things I don't give
a crap about.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.584
Ergo, Dominika has
one brother, and his
name is Al.

11:52.671 --> 11:56.334
Maybe the testicular damage
set the stage for
something worse.

11:56.466 --> 12:00.459
Multiple sclerosis causes
incontinence and progresses
faster in men with low T.

12:00.596 --> 12:01.631
Way to stay on point.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.804
It's that kind of leadership
that's putting you at
the head of the pack.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.140
There is no pack.
She's the only applicant.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.894
Well, that's settled, then.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.812
Have your underlings do an LP

12:12.941 --> 12:16.604
and get a cranio-spinal MRI
to check for plaques
associated with MS.

12:16.695 --> 12:20.028
I will go tell Foreman
about your promotion.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.397
Wait.
Wait.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.153
CHI: So nobody cares
about the job until I apply

12:27.247 --> 12:30.455
and suddenly it's the last
limited edition lightsaber
at Comicon?

12:30.542 --> 12:33.830
Just seems like it should
go to someone with
more seniority.

12:33.921 --> 12:34.956
Meaning you.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.503
I said more, not most.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.126
Meaning you or Taub.

12:38.216 --> 12:41.800
House is a dictator.
Second-in-command is a
meaningless position.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.548
Doesn't look meaningless
on my resume.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.716
It doesn't have to be
meaningless at all.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.306
The right person
could turn it into something,

12:48.393 --> 12:50.099
get the department
running smoothly.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.223
I wonder who that right
person could be.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.971
House is the head
of the department.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.354
It's only fair that a woman
should hold the other
position of authority.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.777
Yeah, let's go affirmative
action on this, because then
I'll definitely win.

13:00.864 --> 13:05.107
This is what House wants.
Wind us up and watch us fight
over an empty title.

13:05.202 --> 13:09.411
Which would make us
extra stupid because of what
we've just been through.

13:09.539 --> 13:13.248
We should let him choose
whoever he wants and move on.

13:17.047 --> 13:20.130
So if these proteins are in
my spinal fluid, that means
I have MS.

13:20.217 --> 13:23.209
The proteins may indicate MS.
There's no one
definitive test.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.635
That's why Dr. House
ordered an MRI as well.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.717
This is anaesthetic.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.761
JESSICA: It's a
scary diagnosis,

13:31.395 --> 13:33.306
but advances are being made.

13:33.397 --> 13:36.264
Several drugs approved
just this year.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.516
To be honest,
at the moment I'm feeling
a little more worried

13:38.610 --> 13:40.271
about the
testosterone injections.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.360
It's making me feel different.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.983
Kind of amped.

13:45.784 --> 13:50.153
I went through this big
life change, and it felt
really meaningful,

13:51.915 --> 13:54.657
but what if it was
all just chemistry?

13:55.419 --> 13:58.377
Loss of testosterone
could have been a factor.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.296
But think of it as a catalyst.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.045
It got you to re-evaluate.
Now you know what's important.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.593
You can choose to
hold on to that.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.920
Right?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.298
Certainly worth trying.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.434
Deep breath, stay very still.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.396
Just tell House
to drop the whole
team leader thing.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.984
That's the only way
it'll go away.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.021
I don't think it's
such a bad idea.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.612
A little more structure in
your department couldn't hurt.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.316
Yeah, House is doing
this because of his
great love of structure,

14:29.411 --> 14:31.902
not because he wants us
to turn on each other.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.737
So, don't do that.

14:34.875 --> 14:39.164
It makes sense to have
someone in there with a
little more accountability.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.370
As long as it's not Adams.

14:41.465 --> 14:45.799
She sees the whole thing
as an opportunity to remake
the department in her image.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.172
Or Park, for obvious reasons.

14:49.056 --> 14:53.095
And Taub's got the kids.
He's pretty busy.

14:53.185 --> 14:56.803
Are you seriously angling
for a job that you mocked
as fake

14:56.897 --> 14:59.183
the whole time I had it?
I don't want the job.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.732
You just don't want
anyone else to have it.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.981
This'll be great.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.067

is kind of sexy.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.371
This is Taras Shevchenko,
the greatest Ukrainian poet.

Is he the guy behind

From Kremenchuk?

15:20.712 --> 15:21.872
Help me move coffee table.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.587
Well, then, where
will we have coffee?

15:24.674 --> 15:26.414
And by coffee, I mean scotch.

15:26.510 --> 15:30.469
Coffee and booze are
artificial high. For me,
high is in exercise.

of time to learn a ton
of uninteresting facts.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.555
Welcome to my wheelhouse.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.513
You brought a protractor?

16:18.937 --> 16:21.349
You never know
when you might need to
make a pie chart.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.484
Looks like someone is
currying favor for the
team leader position.

16:27.779 --> 16:28.814
Yes.

16:28.905 --> 16:33.990

Some male lizards do
push-ups to attract mates.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.103
When scientists gave them
extra testosterone,

17:07.194 --> 17:08.809
they did push-ups
until they died.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.030

took advantage of

17:11.114 --> 17:13.947

Periventricular and

17:18.705 --> 17:23.665

is ingrained and irrational.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.125
I'm saying it's
pointless to try...

17:26.213 --> 17:30.206
By extension, you're also
saying femininity is
enlightened and rational.

17:30.842 --> 17:34.175
It's the way we should all be.
Guys just aren't
capable of it.

It's not a brain tumor

it on the scans.

Quite the display of

smart to fall for a blatant

Or a blatant flaunting
of cleavage like those.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.625
What happened to not
letting House get to you?

18:48.712 --> 18:52.876

marching off the cliff of
competitive humiliation.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.794
All I'm doing is myjob.

There's nothing wrong
with me using my strengths
to my advantage.

19:00.557 --> 19:04.550

down to your knees and...

not your strength.

He'd be a good pick.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.340
You let the rest
of them compete,

with the save.

but it's a bad idea.

but I'm not sure
I can pull off that wig.

20:05.955 --> 20:09.948
Everybody was playing nice,
and in your world,
nice doesn't solve cases.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.956
But after what happened,
a little bonding
is a good thing.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.455
We still have ideas,
we still argue.

20:21.471 --> 20:25.384

that whole thing without
once moving your lips.

not moving.

20:32.065 --> 20:35.307
I get it.
I won't play along with
your stupid games,

20:35.443 --> 20:37.559
so I'm no longer
a man. Clever.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.020
Actually, you won't play along
with my stupid games

20:40.156 --> 20:41.692
because you're no
longer a man.

20:42.117 --> 20:45.325
Still clever, though.
Studies have shown
that raising kids

20:45.453 --> 20:47.830
lowers testosterone
levels in men.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.787
The more involved you are,
the lower it gets.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.996
Right, having kids
has neutered me.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.830
Or maybe it's helped
me finally grow up.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.302
How are you feeling?

As long as I keep

So, I think we should talk
to Leading Lights about
seminars and DVDs.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.379
You sure?
You were worried about
the commitment.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.722
Yeah, there's no point
being in business
with them halfway.

21:51.686 --> 21:52.675

longer than anyone

23:06.469 --> 23:07.458
Probably.

23:07.595 --> 23:11.133
You deserve it.
You have way more
experience than me.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.384
You're giving up?

23:12.475 --> 23:15.717
I wish. I still have a lot
of med school debt.

23:15.812 --> 23:18.804
And my parents need help
with their mortgage.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.480
So, I could kind of
use the money.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.107

I'm just seeing one
of everything.

23:26.239 --> 23:30.232

were right about...

23:33.746 --> 23:35.327
You want to game me,
you've gotta do
better than that.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.491
Chase...
You want to be a leader,

23:36.583 --> 23:38.323
you have to know how
to manipulate.
You can'tjust spill...

There's something wrong
with your liver.

his enzymes are totally
out of whack.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.690
So much for
myasthenia gravis.

24:04.819 --> 24:07.856
Can we hurry this up?
I have a government
to defraud at noon.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.448
If you need to leave,
you should.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.944

our patient's got sarcoidosis.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.026
Wow, you said that with
so much authority.

24:14.537 --> 24:15.697
Did anyone else
get chills?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.744
Just until I realized
our patient has

24:17.832 --> 24:19.868
no sign of parenchymal
lung abnormalities,

24:20.001 --> 24:21.741
which makes sarcoidosis
a long shot.

24:21.836 --> 24:24.418
And bookkeeping isn't gonna
get you any farther than
the boobs.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.630
Though in fairness,
the boobs were really,
really helping.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.332
I still think it's
myasthenia gravis.

24:29.427 --> 24:32.089
Did you miss the recap?
We treated for that,
the liver tanked.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.296
But his vision got better.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.177
The liver problems could
be a sign of celiac.

24:37.352 --> 24:39.183
He's been back on gluten
since he's been
in the hospital.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.305
Yesterday he had a burger.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.978
That would've kicked his
celiac into gear, causing
the liver problems.

24:43.441 --> 24:46.899
So your theory
is that he has two
unrelated diseases.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.977
And he's already got
low testosterone.

24:49.072 --> 24:52.189
I seem to remember
something about House
hating coincidences.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.318
It's true.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.993
I think it's Lyme disease.
One single disease named Lyme.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.156
Without a rash?

24:58.247 --> 24:59.953
10% of cases present
without a rash.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.994
Lyme disease it is.
Start the patient
on antibiotics.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.707

before my fake wife
gets real annoyed.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.422
Something bothering you?

25:17.517 --> 25:20.634
I asked the nurse
for an extra pillow.
That was half an hour ago.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.684
Sorry, things can
get pretty hectic.

25:22.772 --> 25:25.479
It's a pillow. I mean,
how hard can a pillow...

25:27.527 --> 25:29.438
Listen to me,
I'm being a jerk.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.739
Testosterone can give you
a shorter temper even
when you're not sick.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.987
You noticed and adjusted.
That's a good thing.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.161
MARLENE: Hey.

25:40.248 --> 25:42.284
Just got a call
from our lawyer.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.117
You changed our counter
to Leading Lights?

25:45.211 --> 25:48.248
You deserve proper billing
and a salary bump
in the second term.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.831
We talked about this.
We decided it wasn't worth
potentially blowing the deal.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.462
It'll be fine.

25:57.849 --> 26:00.090
I've got to get
some work done.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.022
These are such
pretty flowers
you buy for me.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.730
Every Friday from
Japanese florist,

26:11.821 --> 26:14.813
on corner of Edison
and Conway.
There's just one more thing.

26:17.368 --> 26:18.574
With this ring,

26:19.495 --> 26:21.281
I thee wedded.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.452
You left it here when you
skipped town with
your boyfriend.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.538
You kept the rings?

26:28.629 --> 26:31.541
Actually, I tried to trade
them to a hooker for
unspecified favors.

26:31.632 --> 26:34.089
But it turns out she
doesn't accept zinc.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.838

there was a girl I
wanted to impress.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.211
So ljumped off the roof

Broke my ankle.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.883
Joe's basically going
through puberty.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.308
It'll take him a
while to adjust.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.854
I tracked down a video
from one of Joe's
business coaching seminars

27:33.945 --> 27:36.402
from before I knew him.

27:36.531 --> 27:39.648
JOE: (ON COMPUTER) I’m hearing
a lot about the value
of compromise.

you’re a loser.

27:49.252 --> 27:50.867
If you aren’t comfortable
with that,

27:51.587 --> 27:53.669
go open a pottery studio.

27:56.342 --> 28:00.005
I never would have gone out
with the guy in this video.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.925
Do you remember
the last time she
visited Vasyl?

28:10.189 --> 28:13.522
Uh... Let me see.
That would be August?

28:13.609 --> 28:16.225
No, no, July.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.278
I remember.
It was right after
our half anniversary

28:19.365 --> 28:21.777
and I forgot to put
a gift in her suitcase.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.610
And I never heard
the end of that one.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.202

28:27.832 --> 28:29.618

28:37.633 --> 28:40.716
Honey, why do you do
this to me? You know I'm
watching my weight.

28:40.803 --> 28:45.422
Then maybe you stop eating
cheese in front of open fridge
in middle of the night.

good in here.

28:53.858 --> 28:56.315

28:56.402 --> 28:59.144

29:26.766 --> 29:30.384
Of course. They've been
my neighbors about
two years now.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.508
Lovely couple.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.020
I see them almost every night.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.391
They seem always
to be together.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.105
Great. Thanks for your help.

You're that guy that plays
noisy video games with House
on Saturday nights.

30:05.221 --> 30:06.882
There's a simple explanation.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.267
Be at my office
tomorrow at 10:00.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.068
The patient's shown
zero improvement.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.320
Because he's only been
on the antibiotics overnight.

30:29.412 --> 30:31.698
Or because he doesn't
have Lyme disease.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.127
His change in diet
has to be significant.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.471
We just need to do an
intestinal biopsy
to confirm.

30:50.599 --> 30:54.012
With his low platelet count,
a biopsy puts him at risk
for an abdominal bleed,

30:54.103 --> 30:55.684
which puts him
at risk of death.

you were in love
with Dominika,

been living together.

There's no getting
out of this.

31:42.151 --> 31:46.019
The best you can hope for
is that you don’t
go back to jail.

31:49.617 --> 31:54.031
Tell my team to skip
the biopsy and give the
antibiotics more time.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.617
They're ready for us.

32:00.795 --> 32:04.128
I drew a line in the sand
and I won. We should
be celebrating.

Do you need a few minutes?
I'd rather keep
getting better.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.000
That's just it.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.219
You won. You made a demand
that could have
blown up the deal

32:12.348 --> 32:15.636
and you never even asked me.
The deal didn't blow up,
they caved.

32:15.726 --> 32:19.719
Joe, you say it in your
seminars. Process matters just
as much as results.

32:19.855 --> 32:24.394
Are you seriously busting
my chops because I made
one little move without you?

32:24.527 --> 32:26.017
How about stepping aside

32:26.153 --> 32:29.486
and letting me be the man
in this relationship
for a change?

32:32.159 --> 32:34.866
I really can't talk
to you right now.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.374
I don't know
why I said that.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.498
Just, I got so angry.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.170
Hopefully after this dose,

32:50.261 --> 32:52.843
you'll start to feel better
and we can get you home.

32:57.852 --> 33:00.594
But I'd like to do
one more test.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.979
The testimony of one angry,
near-sighted neighbor

33:04.066 --> 33:06.227
shouldn't outweigh all
other evidence.
Photos, utility bills...

33:06.360 --> 33:08.817
Yes. Because your
clients would never
fake anything.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.488
We acknowledge the neighbor
thing was a mistake,
but that doesn't mean

33:12.575 --> 33:14.782
that all the other
documentation should just
be thrown out.

didn't bleed out.

Now you're in here
watching a motivational
speech.

38:02.865 --> 38:05.982
Even your attempt
to get your balls
back lacks balls.

38:06.076 --> 38:09.193
JOE: ...wor/d, the
business world.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.327
If you’re not a winner,
you’re a loser.

38:11.415 --> 38:14.452
His voice, it's lower
than it is now.

38:14.543 --> 38:17.535
If only there was a good
reason for a professional
speaker to be hoarse.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.916
...go open a pottery studio.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.424
Good point.

38:24.052 --> 38:27.340
It's not a good point.
It's a decent point.

38:27.431 --> 38:29.922
You're doing it again.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.095
You got any other videos,
other seminars?
A couple.

38:33.228 --> 38:36.812
When you see a weakness,
that’s a time for strength.

38:36.899 --> 38:40.232
A lot of people say, "I feel
bad about it. " The other guy
made a mistake...

38:40.360 --> 38:42.442
You bailed too early.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.402
Now I get all the credit.

38:44.531 --> 38:46.738
That kind of thinking is
what makes you...

38:49.369 --> 38:55.911
Chronic hoarseness is a
symptom of a condition
called silent thyroiditis.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.367
But I'm not hoarse.

38:58.462 --> 39:00.748
Exactly. But you were,
three years ago.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.501
Silent thyroiditis
comes and goes.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.378
And it, in turn,
is a symptom

39:05.469 --> 39:09.053
of Polyglandular Autoimmune
syndrome, type 3.

39:09.139 --> 39:11.926
Which makes this
is a really bad idea.

39:15.437 --> 39:19.225
PAS-3 attacks
the body's own
endocrine system,

39:19.399 --> 39:20.730
moving from gland to gland.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.485
It started in the
thyroid, then,

39:22.611 --> 39:24.943
probably helped along
by your low testosterone,

39:25.280 --> 39:27.692
moved on to the gut.
TAUB: Where it caused
celiac disease,

39:27.783 --> 39:29.774
or it would've,
if you weren't on a
gluten-free diet.

39:30.619 --> 39:31.984
I was right.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.781
This is incredibly relevant.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.447
HOUSE: Eventually PAS-3
attacked your thymus gland.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.826
You developed myasthenia
gravis, which landed
you in here.

39:40.963 --> 39:44.080
Then you started eating
gluten, which only made
things worse.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.550
So, am I gonna
be okay?

39:45.634 --> 39:47.545
We'll treat the various
conditions with high-dose
steroids.

39:47.636 --> 39:50.469
Assuming they respond,
you'll be fine.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.133
And the testosterone?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.972
Kicked in the nuts is
kicked in the nuts.

40:03.318 --> 40:07.982
HOUSE: Over the past week,
you have all had good
moments and bad.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.406
No one candidate
has prevailed.

40:11.660 --> 40:17.246
So now we embark upon
a contest of medical strength,

40:17.332 --> 40:19.994
stamina and skill.

40:20.127 --> 40:21.162
Can we just get
this over with?

40:21.295 --> 40:25.004
If the competitor representing
Australia would like to
take a point deduction,

40:25.132 --> 40:27.168
he should by all means
continue yapping.

40:27.634 --> 40:30.671
Your glee is on the verge
of making this not worth
it for any of us.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.257
Can I at least
light the torch?

40:34.099 --> 40:35.134
Hurry.

40:41.356 --> 40:46.601
I declare open the games
of the number one
number two competition.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.936
Je déclare ouvert...

40:49.364 --> 40:51.525
All right.
Ready, set, suture!

41:00.834 --> 41:01.869
T-time.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.121
What happens if
I don't take it?

41:04.212 --> 41:06.373
Or at least, go to a
much lower dose.

41:06.506 --> 41:07.541
Are you having side effects?

41:07.674 --> 41:09.050
No, I feel great.

41:09.176 --> 41:10.541
Faster, clearer.

41:10.886 --> 41:12.672
More like myself.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.216
But my marriage and my career,

41:16.350 --> 41:19.558
they're both built
on me being somebody else.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.728
Low testosterone can
cause depression and
problems sleeping.

41:22.814 --> 41:27.023
It's also been linked
to conditions such as
osteoporosis and diabetes.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.819
It will make your life harder
and more dangerous,

41:30.906 --> 41:32.487
on top of all the meds
you'll be taking.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.655
I'll take that risk.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.036
I'm a better man
without it.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.520
Well, this certainly has
brought more structure
to the department.

42:07.567 --> 42:10.900
Really, I'm just excited
for the wheelchair race.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.855
You were smart not to enter.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.906
Never in, never lose.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.568
And since you no
longer have stones...

42:20.747 --> 42:23.454
I'll split the 50
a week with you.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.543
Deal.

42:35.929 --> 42:37.339
(LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

43:11.089 --> 43:12.795
Honey, I'm home!
