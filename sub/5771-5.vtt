WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:07.775
OH, NO.

00:07.807 --> 00:09.609
CODE RED.
HELP! HELP! EMERGENCY!

00:09.642 --> 00:10.610
YES?

00:10.643 --> 00:12.346
MY TV IS BROKEN.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.546
AND I CANNOT BE ALONE
WITH MY THOUGHTS.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.148
I'M COMING BACK
FROM AN ENEMY'S WEDDING.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.684
MA'AM, YOU'RE BEING
VERY DISRUPTIVE.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.451
YOU KNOW, I AM SO TIRED
OF PEOPLE TELLING ME THAT.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.786
FINE. WHATEVER.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.222
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAYBE THIS IS FATE.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.224
MAYBE THE PERSON
SITTING NEXT TO ME

00:24.258 --> 00:26.293
IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.661
MAYBE THIS IS
A FLIGHT OF DESTINY.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.631
OH, THANK YOU.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.300
WAIT, WHY DID YOU
JUST TAKE MY PICTURE?

00:32.332 --> 00:34.202
I'M REQUIRED TO ANY TIME
I HEAR CERTAIN WORDS

00:34.235 --> 00:37.337
LIKE "CODE RED"
OR "FLIGHT OF DESTINY."

00:37.370 --> 00:39.707
OKAY. I FIND THAT RACIAL.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.474
(woman over P.A.)
WE REMIND YOU THAT THIS
IS A NON-SMOKING FLIGHT.

00:41.508 --> 00:44.212
SMOKING IS PROHIBITED
ON THE ENTIRE AIRCRAFT.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.347
OH, HEY!
SORRY.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.850
[coughing]

00:50.883 --> 00:54.255

00:56.789 --> 00:58.692
UH, I GOTTA GET IN.
YOU WANNA--

00:58.726 --> 01:00.060
THAT'S OKAY.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.696
SORRY. I'M SORRY.
NO. AH--

01:02.729 --> 01:03.830
OH!

01:03.863 --> 01:06.467
OOH. OH, THANK GOD, MAN.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.667
I'M ALWAYS SO WORRIED
THEY'RE GONNA

01:07.701 --> 01:09.236
STICK ME NEXT TO
SOMEONE SKINNY.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.471
THEN I GOTTA PUT UP
WITH THEIR

01:10.503 --> 01:12.540
SKINNY STINK EYE
THE WHOLE FLIGHT.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.741
EXCUSE ME?
YEAH,
JUST LIKE THAT.

01:14.774 --> 01:17.410
I'M SORRY, SIR,
I AM A PETITE ASIAN WOMAN.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.212
SO AM I.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.314
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
IS YOU AND ME,

01:20.347 --> 01:22.349
CHUBS LIKE US, WE GOTTA
STICK TOGETHER IN THE SKY.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.585
HOW DARE YOU?

01:24.618 --> 01:27.655
UH, SORRY, SIR,
I THINK THIS IS MY SEAT.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.556
OH, COME ON, DUDE,
I JUST GOT MY FAN OUT.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.125
I--

01:31.159 --> 01:32.126
OKAY, COME ON, MOVE IT.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.326
HAPPY TO SWITCH WITH YOU.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.662
'SCUSE ME, SORRY.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
AFTER YOU, THIN GUY.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.132
HI.
HI.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.432
WELCOME TO ROW 17.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.634
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.737
I WAS WORRIED I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO KEVIN SMITH.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.639
OH, COME ON, THAT'S HURTFUL,
MAN, I CAN HEAR YOU.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.775
OH, G--UH, SORRY.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.377
HEY. I LOVE CHASING AMY.

01:49.409 --> 01:50.577

01:56.349 --> 01:58.819
TAKE YOUR CELL PHONE OUT AND
CALL YOUR WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND

01:58.851 --> 01:59.852
AND TELL THEM
YOU LOVE THEM.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.589
I USUALLY GO WITH, UM,

02:01.622 --> 02:03.390
"MISS, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO SWITCH SEATS

02:03.423 --> 02:04.424
SO THAT YOU CAN SIT
NEXT TO YOUR HUSBAND?"

02:04.458 --> 02:07.294
OH. I GUESS YOU HIT ON
YOUR SEATMATES QUITE A BIT.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.262
ONLY WHEN I LIKE WHAT
I'M SITTING NEXT TO.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.730
(man over P.A.)
CABIN CREW,
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS

02:10.763 --> 02:14.635
FOR TAKEOFF.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.638
OH, NO.
OH, NO. OH--

02:17.671 --> 02:19.440
HOW CAN YOU
NOT WATCH THIS?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.442
I MEAN, THE MAN HAS TO EAT
A SEVEN-POUND BURRITO.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.445
I'M ACTUALLY--I'M READING A BOOK
ABOUT THE EPIC STRUGGLE

02:24.477 --> 02:26.814
TO BRING THE TELEGRAPH
TO AUSTRALIA IN 1872.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.749
UGH. WHO'S MAKING YOU
READ THAT?

02:28.781 --> 02:31.185
NO ONE.
IT'S FOR PLEASURE.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.287
OH, I GET IT.
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE SNOBS.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.356
YOU PROBABLY, LIKE,
WATCH HIGHBROW STUFF

02:35.388 --> 02:36.757
LIKE CELEBRITY REHAB.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.393
I AM AN ARTS AND CULTURE WRITER
FOR THE NEW YORK INDEPENDENT.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.331
I LOVE THAT PAPER.
IT'S MOSTLY SEX ADS AND THINGS.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.766
HEY, IT'S ALSO THE PREFERRED
KITTY LITTER LINING

02:45.799 --> 02:47.301
FOR DISCERNING
CAT LADIES.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.270
[laughs]
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.271
IN CASE YOU WERE TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.440
GREAT, THAT WAS THE LAST ITEM
ON MY CHECKLIST,

02:52.472 --> 02:54.407
SO DO YOU WANT
TO GO OUT?
YES.

02:54.442 --> 02:57.278
OH, THANK GOD, OKAY.
I HAVE TO PEE.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.144
I'VE BEEN HOLDING IT IN
FOR TWO HOURS

02:58.178 --> 02:59.447
IN THE HOPES THAT YOU
WOULD ASK ME OUT.

02:59.479 --> 03:02.416
I THINK I GAVE
MYSELF A UTI.
[laughs]

03:02.449 --> 03:05.785
THIS IS GREAT.
IT WAS WORTH IT. BYE.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.555
IS THAT A JOKE?

03:10.790 --> 03:12.392
ARE YOU GOING IN?
MM-HMM.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.328
PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.329
OH, GOD.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.332
[upbeat music]

03:19.367 --> 03:27.375
*

03:33.747 --> 03:36.250
SO I'M RUNNING THROUGH BATTERY
PARK LOOKING FOR BATTERIES

03:36.284 --> 03:39.353
WHICH I DON'T FIND,
BUT I DO FIND ADVENTURE...

03:39.387 --> 03:41.355
NO, MORGAN.
THIS IS FRIBBLEDY-FROO.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.656
I'VE TOLD YOU REPEATEDLY TO KEEP
YOUR ANECDOTES WORK-RELATED.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.760
EVERYONE, I MET A HOT GUY
ON AN AIRPLANE.
NOPE.

03:46.794 --> 03:47.995
OOH.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.997
WE TALKING MILE HIGH CLUB?

03:50.029 --> 03:51.399
PLEASE. YOU THINK I WOULD BE
IN THE MILE HIGH CLUB?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.232
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.868
AIRPLANE BATHROOMS.
UGH. UNHYGIENIC.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.970
ALSO I'M WORRIED THAT MY BUTT
WOULD GET SUCKED INTO THE SINK.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.039
OH, IT WILL. TRICK IS TO USE
THAT SUCTION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

04:00.072 --> 04:02.343
I'LL SHOW YOU ALL ABOUT IT
ON OUR NEXT BUSINESS TRIP.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.378
NO.
UGH.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.579
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, NOW.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.747
YOU KNOW I WAS ON
THAT SULLENBERGER FLIGHT

04:06.780 --> 04:08.047
THAT WENT DOWN IN THE HUDSON.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.416
IT WAS AN AMAZING DAY.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.551
I'M JUST SAYING THAT PLANE

04:10.584 --> 04:11.652
WASN'T THE ONLY THING
TO GET GOOSED.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.321
(Mindy)
OH, COME ON, PETER.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.521
THAT FLIGHT WAS, LIKE,
TWO MINUTES, DUDE.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.589
THAT'S ALL I NEED.
OW!

04:16.624 --> 04:17.590
OH, STOP!

04:17.625 --> 04:18.992
NONE OF THIS
IS APPROPRIATE.

04:19.025 --> 04:20.127
[Morgan and Peter fighting]

04:20.159 --> 04:23.297
SO THIS GUY IS THE ARTS
AND CULTURE EDITOR FOR THIS

04:23.331 --> 04:26.399
LITTLE ANARCHIST NEWSPAPER
CALLED THE NEW YORK INDEPENDENT.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.437
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BORING STUFF,
BUT COOL PHOTO, RIGHT?

04:29.469 --> 04:32.072
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE
NOT DATING JASON RICHMOND.

04:32.104 --> 04:32.873
NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.309
HE'S GOT INCREDIBLY
HIGH STANDARDS.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.411
THE PSYCHOPATH WHO CALLED
BON JOVI PEDESTRIAN?

04:37.445 --> 04:39.413
HE GOT US THROUGH SANDY.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.981
YOU HAVE NOTHING
IN COMMON WITH THIS GUY.

04:41.013 --> 04:43.317
IF ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE
ME HANGING OUT WITH HIM.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.652
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
THE ADVENTURES WE'D HAVE?

04:45.685 --> 04:50.324
JUST SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK.
IN THE ROUND.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.326
WHAT THE HELL?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.894
WHOA.
OKAY.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.430
OH, YEAH.

04:56.464 --> 04:59.098
THERE'S A COUPON
FOR JEANS IN HERE. GONNA--

04:59.131 --> 05:00.099
GONNA CHECK THAT OUT.

05:00.132 --> 05:04.438
THAT'S MY PAPER.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.075
CHRISTINA,
IT'S YOUR EX-HUSBAND DAN.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.643
I SEE YOU'RE THROWING
AN ART EXHIBIT

05:09.677 --> 05:11.879
WITH THOSE PRIVATE,
NAKED PHOTOS OF ME.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.346
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.947
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE DOING IT
TO GET BACK AT ME

05:14.981 --> 05:16.116
FOR THE WAY THINGS ENDED,
WELL, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME

05:16.149 --> 05:17.551
BECAUSE I LOVE IT.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.620
I LOVE IT.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.428
SO, MINDY, WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE MOVIE?

05:27.460 --> 05:29.363
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY REAL.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.631
OKAY.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.098
I THOUGHT THEY LOOKED LIKE
PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE

05:32.132 --> 05:34.368
IN LINE BEHIND ME
AT THE BANK.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.437
I WAS NOT SURE WHY WE PAID
MONEY TO SEE IT.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.038
OKAY, BECAUSE FOR ME
IT WAS KIND OF REFRESHING

05:38.070 --> 05:41.108
TO SEE NORMAL PEOPLE
FALLING IN LOVE IN A MOVIE.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.844
I HAVE NOT YET TIRED OF SEEING
HOT PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.945
[laughs]

05:44.978 --> 05:46.046
SO YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE
WHERE, LIKE, RACHEL MCADAMS

05:46.078 --> 05:49.049
IS THE UGLY DUCKLING WHO--
WHO'S ALWAYS THE BRIDESMAID

05:49.081 --> 05:50.117
BUT CAN NEVER
FIND MR. RIGHT.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.386
WHEN DOES THAT MOVIE COME OUT?
THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.854
[laughs]

05:53.887 --> 05:55.154
I HAVE AN EMAIL ALERT
FOR RACHEL MCADAMS.

05:55.187 --> 05:56.222
I ACTUALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.157
NO, THAT'S A FAKE MOVIE
THAT I MADE OUT OF CLICHES.

05:58.190 --> 06:01.428
[laughs]
MM-HMM.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.104
AH!

06:24.517 --> 06:26.554
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PREWAR
OR POSTWAR, BUT I LIKE IT A LOT.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.587
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.088
DO YOU WANT
TO COME UPSTAIRS?

06:29.122 --> 06:31.157
YOU JUST HAVE TO
LET ME GO INSIDE FIRST

06:31.191 --> 06:32.792
'CAUSE I THINK I FORGOT
TO FLUSH THE TOILET.

06:32.825 --> 06:36.063
YEAH, I'D, UM...
I'D LOVE TO COME UP.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.130
YEAH?
YEAH.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.971
THIS IS A PLEASANT
SURPRISE.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.473
THAT I'M SUCH
A GOOD KISSER?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.941
NO, THAT YOU'RE
ASKING ME TO COME UP.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.109
WHEN IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THERE'S, YOU KNOW,

06:49.141 --> 06:50.110
MUCH OF A FUTURE HERE.

06:50.142 --> 06:52.144
WAIT, I'M SORRY, WHAT?

06:52.179 --> 06:54.114
NO, JUST THAT IT--

06:54.146 --> 06:57.551
I--THAT WE--YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON CULTURALLY.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.186
EH--

06:59.218 --> 07:00.420
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I'M NOT CULTURED?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.056
I'M DEEPLY CULTURED.
I'VE BEEN TO LONDON.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.224
I SAW MAMMA MIA
ON THE WEST END.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.061
BEFORE IT TRANSFERRED TO
BROADWAY, WHERE I SAW IT AGAIN.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.963
MINDY, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.131
LOOK, HEY,
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.701
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT A DAMPER
ON THE REST OF TONIGHT.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.069
TONIGHT? SERIOUSLY?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.672
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
THIS INSULTED.

07:18.705 --> 07:22.510
I MEAN, I HAVE LOTS OF TIMES,
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.077
MINDY, CAN YOU FORGET
THAT I SAID THAT?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.880
I, UH...

07:27.914 --> 07:31.519
I'D BE HAPPY TO LISTEN TO
ONE DIRECTION WHILE WE DO IT.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.721
THE DOCUMENTARY OR THEIR ALBU--
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.122
DON'T TELL ME.
YOU MESSED UP.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.492
HAVE A FUN NIGHT TONIGHT,
BY YOURSELF.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.192
[door closes]

07:41.761 --> 07:43.096
THIS CITY USED TO BE
SO MUCH BETTER

07:43.130 --> 07:46.699
WHEN ANYONE COULD GET MUGGED
AT ANYTIME, YOU KNOW?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.200
WHAT?

07:48.235 --> 07:50.170
DOCTORS. WE HAVEN'T MET.
I'M BRENDAN DESLAURIERS.

07:50.202 --> 07:52.039
OH, YOU'RE THE MIDWIFE.
COOL.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.974
NO. NO, THAT'S NOT
OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT.

07:54.007 --> 07:54.841
I SAID COOL.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.977
I'M VERY EXCITED
TO SEE YOUR SHOW, DANNY.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.045
YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY DON'T YOU
BITE ME, DESLAURIERS?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.980
THAT WAS NOT
SARCASTIC.
YEAH, IT WAS.
IT WAS.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.681
NO, IT WAS NOT.
I KNOW SARCASM
WHEN I HEAR IT.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.617
OKAY, THIS GUY'S
JUST BEING NICE.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.620
HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT--
EXCUSE ME, WHAT SHOW IS THAT?

08:06.653 --> 08:10.189
HEY, EVERYONE!
EVERYBODY! HEY!

08:10.223 --> 08:11.691
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS
I'VE BEEN DEBATING

08:11.725 --> 08:13.159
WHETHER OR NOT
TO SHARE WITH YOU GUYS.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.694
YOU RAN FROM
THE ELEVATOR.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.229
OUR DANNY HERE
IS THE SUBJECT

08:16.262 --> 08:19.232
OF AN ART EXHIBIT THAT FEATURES
HIM TASTEFULLY NUDE

08:19.265 --> 08:21.034
AND IT'S OPENING "TOE-NIGHT."

08:21.068 --> 08:22.635
WAIT, I'M SORRY,
"NUDE" AS IN NAKED?

08:22.670 --> 08:24.203
BIRTHDAY SUIT JUNK.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.573
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'LL BE THERE, BUDDY.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.139
I WOULD LOVE TO COME TOO.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.208
NOPE. NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING,
YOU'RE NOT GOING. YOU'RE--

08:29.242 --> 08:30.544
NO ONE'S COMING, OKAY?

08:30.578 --> 08:31.745
OKAY, WHAT KIND
OF FRIEND WOULD I BE

08:31.778 --> 08:33.113
IF YOU COME
TO MY SOCCER MATCHES

08:33.146 --> 08:34.246
AND I DON'T GO
TO YOUR ART SHOW?

08:34.281 --> 08:35.683
IT'S NOT MY ART SHOW,

08:35.716 --> 08:37.084
AND I'M NEVER GOING
TO YOUR SOCCER GAMES.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.885
YOU'RE GOING ON SATURDAY
AND YOU'RE BRINGING JUICE BOXES.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.554
HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.122
ON THE WAY
TO THE ART EXHIBIT

08:42.155 --> 08:43.657
WE'RE GONNA STOP
AND PICK UP WIENERS TO EAT.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.925
SO THEN WHEN WE SHOW UP
TO LOOK AT DANNY'S WIENER

08:45.958 --> 08:48.761
WE'VE ALREADY EATEN WIENERS.
IT GON' BE A WIENER NIGHT.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.929
NO, IT'S NOT.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.198
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A WEINER NIGHT.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.532
[laughs]

08:54.901 --> 08:55.968
[knocks]
HEY.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.004
CAN I HAVE A PLUS-ONE
TO YOUR WIENER NIGHT THING?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.240
I'M THINKING OF INVITING THAT
SNOBBY GUY JASON TO COME TO IT.

09:00.272 --> 09:01.741
NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT

09:01.775 --> 09:03.309
AND IT'S NOT CALLED
"WIENER NIGHT," OKAY?

09:03.342 --> 09:05.078
IF ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE
CALLED "INJUSTICE NIGHT."

09:05.112 --> 09:06.278
WELL, I THINK THAT
"WIENER NIGHT"

09:06.313 --> 09:07.714
HAS REALLY TAKEN OFF
AS A NICKNAME.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.282
[sighs] WHY ARE YOU
SEEING THAT GUY AGAIN?

09:09.315 --> 09:10.750
WASN'T HE REALLY
INSULTING TO YOU?

09:10.784 --> 09:13.753
YES, HE WAS, DANNY,
BUT IT BOTHERS ME

09:13.787 --> 09:15.789
THAT HE THINKS HE'S SO MUCH
BETTER THAN ME AND HE'S NOT.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.124
I JUST WANT TO
PROVE IT TO HIM.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.259
OH, GOOD, I'M GLAD THIS CAN
ALL BE WORKED OUT

09:20.293 --> 09:22.062
OVER PHOTOS OF MY GENITALS.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.231
I'M SORRY, WERE YOU FORCED
TO TAKE THOSE PHOTOS

09:24.263 --> 09:25.898
AGAINST YOUR WILL?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.234
OR DID YOU TAKE THEM AS, LIKE,
SEXY TIME WITH YOUR WIFE?

09:27.266 --> 09:29.769
OKAY.
OKAY, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT, OKAY.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.105
[phone rings]

09:32.139 --> 09:33.372
JASON RICHMOND.

09:33.405 --> 09:34.373
(Mindy)
SO I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M REALLY LAME

09:34.406 --> 09:35.507
BECAUSE I CAN'T
QUOTE SHAKESPEARE

09:35.541 --> 09:37.910
OR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
BUT I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

09:37.944 --> 09:40.880
THAT I AM GOING TO A VERY
ARTSY-FARTSY THING TONIGHT.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.783
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE?

09:42.815 --> 09:44.284
NOPE, AND GET THIS,
THE ARTIST CHRISTINA PORTER,

09:44.316 --> 09:47.354
IS THE EX-WIFE OF A WORK
ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE.

09:47.386 --> 09:50.658
OKAY, DOCTOR,
I AM VERY IMPRESSED.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.792
ARE YOU INVITING ME?

09:51.824 --> 09:53.926
MAYBE IF YOU
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT

09:53.960 --> 09:55.327
YOU'LL FIND YOUR
PULITZER IN BED.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.698
I'M CONFUSED BY THE TONE
OF THIS PHONE CALL.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.133
BYE, LOVE YOU.
WHAT?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.269
OKAY, SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT SHE TOOK THE PHOTOS?

10:02.302 --> 10:05.873
I WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER YES.
I DID KNOW THAT.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.240
BUT YOU DIDN'T
SIGN A RELEASE.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.041
WHAT'S A RELEASE?
THE PAPER SHE HAD ME SIGN?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.242
YES, I DID SIGN IT.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.444
BUT I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION

10:11.478 --> 10:12.512
'CAUSE THE KENNEDY CENTER
WAS HONORING CREAM THAT NIGHT.

10:12.544 --> 10:14.246
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T GIVE HER
THE RIGHT TO SHOW--

10:14.280 --> 10:16.248
THE WHOLE WORLD
MY UNDERCARRIAGE.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.050
OKAY, WELL, I'M PROBABLY
JUST GONNA HAVE TO

10:18.084 --> 10:19.720
VIEW THE PHOTOGRAPHS
FOR MYSELF

10:19.752 --> 10:21.689
AND REALLY, YOU KNOW,
SUSS THE SITUATION OUT,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.190
WHICH IS TOO BAD,
'CAUSE I HAD PLANS TONIGHT.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.057
OH, DID YOU?
'CAUSE I HAD PLANS TOO.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.226
TO NOT HAVE
ALL OF MANHATTAN

10:26.258 --> 10:29.061
STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF MY URETHRA.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.664
OH, WHOA, WHOA.
THAT'S TOO VIVID. ALL RIGHT?

10:30.698 --> 10:32.165
[phone vibrates]
'SCUSE ME ONE SEC, CLIFF.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.667
OH. HEY, MA,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:33.701 --> 10:36.969
YEAH, HOW'D YOU HEAR ABOUT IT?
ARE YOU KI--

10:37.003 --> 10:38.806
NO, YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT COMING.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.841
NO, I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN IT
BUT IT'S CHANGED.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.209
I WAS A BABY.
IT'S CHANGED.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.244
MA. MA. MA!

10:48.380 --> 10:49.349
COME ON, COME ON, YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE BEING VERY DRAMATIC.

10:49.381 --> 10:50.950
I'M DRAMATIC?
YES.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.753
YOU TRIED TO SHUT DOWN
THE M&M STORE

10:52.786 --> 10:54.053
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THE
BROWN LADY M&M STOLE YOUR LOOK.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.155
SHE IS STEALING MY LOOK.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.455
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

10:56.488 --> 10:58.826
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON.
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.026
THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

11:00.059 --> 11:01.895
IS TO GO THERE,
LOOK CHRISTINA IN THE EYE,

11:01.928 --> 11:03.897
AND SHOW HER THAT THIS
DOES NOT BOTHER YOU.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.298
YEAH?
YEAH, AND IT
SHOULDN'T BOTHER YOU.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.300
WE'RE DOCTORS.
WE CAN HANDLE NUDITY.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.002
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS HORRIBLE,
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.302
OKAY, STOP.
YOU SAID WE'RE ADULTS.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.905
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.406
I CAN SEE EVERY
HAIR FOLLICLE.
OH, MAN.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.975
THIS ISN'T GOOD.
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.944
I KNOW I HAVE ONE,
BUT IT'S STILL FUNNY.

11:17.978 --> 11:18.746
[laughter]

11:18.779 --> 11:20.480
WOW. THIS IS WHAT
MAKES YOU LAUGH.

11:20.512 --> 11:21.881
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU, MAN.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.051
THERE'S NOTHING
FUNNIER THAN PENISES.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.720
I CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH SAYING
MY NAME WITHOUT LAUGHING.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.020
ASK ME MY NAME.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.923
PET--
[laughs]

11:29.956 --> 11:31.291
STOP IT. DUDE, STOP IT.
ASK ME MY NAME.

11:31.323 --> 11:32.292
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
P--[laughs]

11:32.324 --> 11:34.126
[laughs]
COME ON.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.329
WHY MUST EVERYTHING
BE SETTLED BY TUSSLING?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.931
OH, MY GOD, TAMRA,
YOU LOOK LIKE CHRISTIE BRINKLEY.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.468
I KNOW, MORGAN. GOD.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.403
THESE PHOTOS
ARE SCANDALOUS.

11:43.435 --> 11:45.973
RAY RON TOOK A PICTURE
OF ME IN A BIKINI ONCE.

11:46.005 --> 11:46.907
I WAS SO MAD.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.941
BUT THEN HE SENT IT
TO THIS MODELING AGENCY.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.244
AND NOW I'M ON
SHAMPOO BOTTLES IN JAPAN.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.012
HOLY CHRISTMAS.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.882
I DON'T KNOW.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.785
PERSONALLY, I WANT A GUY SO RICH
HE CAN JUST LET HIMSELF GO.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.720
BUT NOT SO FAT WHERE HE
HAS TO GET CUT OUT THE HOUSE.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.254
DR. C IS A MASTERPIECE.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.324
AGAIN, THOUGH, I JUST
WANT ME A RICH FATTY.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.126
YOU KNOW, LIKE THOSE CATS
WITH THE CIGARS.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.895
HIS SKIN IS SO TAUT
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IT.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.997
GUYS, I'M SO SORRY
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.932
OH--[stammers]

12:12.966 --> 12:13.933
YOU OKAY?

12:13.967 --> 12:17.003
YOU LOOK GOOD
FOR AN OLD-ASS MAN.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.170
I'M IN MY 30s!

12:18.204 --> 12:20.407
LATE 30s.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.174
(Mindy)
SO, CLIFF,
ARE YOU ENJOYING THE NUDES?

12:22.208 --> 12:22.976
(Cliff)
UH, NO.

12:23.009 --> 12:26.078
DANNY HIRED ME
TO GET THIS SHUT DOWN.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.880
YOU ARE GETTING A LOT
OF BUSINESS FROM US.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.016
AND YET NONE
OF YOU PAY ME.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.819
NOR DO YOU SEEM TO CARE
THAT I'M A DIVORCE LAWYER.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.920
HEY, UM, ONE THING.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.021
PLEASE DON'T GET IT
SHUT DOWN

12:34.053 --> 12:35.856
BEFORE I CAN SHOW MY DATE
HOW SOPHISTICATED I AM.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.925
OH, YOU'VE GOT A DATE.
OKAY.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.927
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
DRESSED LIKE THIS.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.493
USUALLY YOU LOOK
LIKE A PINATA.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.562
OKAY, I LIKE
TO WEAR COLORS.

12:43.595 --> 12:45.799
AND YES, I'M USUALLY
FULL OF CANDY. SUE ME.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.566
I HAD TO GIVE UP
DAUGHTRY TICKETS FOR THIS.

12:47.599 --> 12:48.969
DAUGHTRY?
YEAH.

12:49.001 --> 12:49.903
I LOVE DAUGHTRY.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.237
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
GONE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND

12:51.271 --> 12:52.806
WHO DECIDED TO GO ANYWAY.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.240
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN,
RIGHT?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.810
(Jason)
HI. WOW.
OH, HEY. HI.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.445
JASON, THIS IS CLIFF.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.446
HI.
HI, CLIFF.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.447
CLIFF IS AN ATTORNEY.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.314
NICE TO MEET YOU, JASON.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.316
AND THAT'S MY CLIENT OVER THERE,
GETTING HAMMERED.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.987
UH, EXCUSE ME.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.856
HEY, DANNY.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.123
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE
ARE BUYING THIS CRAP.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.125
IT'S FLUMMOXING.
OKAY, I'M FLUMMOXED.
YEAH.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.893
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
TO TELL YOU,

13:13.926 --> 13:14.927
BUT YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE A CASE.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.462
THIS IS ALL COVERED
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.064
YEAH, WELL,
TODAY AMERICA LOSES.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.100
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.
YEAH.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.568
HEY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT HAVE A CASE

13:22.602 --> 13:24.537
IF THE PUBLIC WERE ABLE
TO VIEW THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.974
YOU KNOW, SAY,
FROM THE STREET.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.175
WHY ARE YOU WINKING AT ME?

13:28.207 --> 13:30.878
I JUST--

13:30.911 --> 13:32.312
THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID.
YEAH, YEAH.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.018
FULL VIEW OF THE STREET.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.486
YOU CAN STRIP A MAN
OF HIS CLOTHING

13:39.519 --> 13:43.055
BUT HE'S STILL GOT LAYERS.
HE CAN STILL HIDE.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.357
MINDY, THIS IS THE LONGEST

13:44.391 --> 13:46.526
YOU'VE EVER GONE
WITHOUT SPEAKING.

13:46.558 --> 13:47.559
WHAT ARE YOUR
FEELINGS ON IT?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.963
WHAT AREN'T
MY FEELINGS ON IT?

13:49.997 --> 13:53.433
THE WAY THAT THERE'S
A CERTAIN SADNESS TO HIS...

13:53.466 --> 13:56.135
THIGH MEAT.

13:56.168 --> 14:00.040
THE LIGHT, HOW IT IS
REFRACTING OFF OF, UM...

14:00.072 --> 14:03.076
THE NADS.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.378
OKAY. OKAY.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.914
HEY, I'M SORRY
THAT SOUNDED REALLY DUMB.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.215
OH, NO.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.482
I'M A SMART PERSON.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY, "NADS."

14:10.516 --> 14:12.051
YOU--NO, SAY WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.886
IT'S ART. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE FUN WITH IT.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.621
BESIDES, I--

14:15.655 --> 14:18.525
I THINK HIS NADS
ARE A TRIUMPH.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.192
[laughs]

14:20.227 --> 14:22.429
[clears throat]
OH, UH, JEREMY.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.563
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FRIEND JASON RICHMOND.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.033
OH, IT'S YOU!
HI.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.066
OH.
I'M SO SORRY.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.068
HERE, I--

14:29.102 --> 14:31.404
NO, NO, NO,
I'M DR. JEREMY REED.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.407
BRITISH.
WE INVENTED CULTURE.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.009
AH.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.477
HELLO? 911?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.147
THIS IS MRS. EMILY FERGUSON.

14:40.179 --> 14:43.050
I WAS WALKING BY THE WOODSEN
GALLERY WITH MY FIVE CHILDREN

14:43.083 --> 14:46.453
AND OUR EYEBALLS WERE
ASSAULTED BY LEWDNESS.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.021
KEEP WALKIN'!

14:48.055 --> 14:50.991
BESIDES GARY LARSON,
WHO'S AN ARTIST YOU FOLLOW?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.993
YOU KNOW, I DON'T FOCUS
ON INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS

14:53.026 --> 14:55.627
SO MUCH AS I DO
WORKS OF ART.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.932
OKAY, SO WHAT'S A FAVORITE?

14:58.966 --> 15:00.900
THE JAPANESE BRIDGE
BY MONET.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.269
[both laugh]

15:02.301 --> 15:03.936
YEAH.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

15:03.971 --> 15:06.106
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDING.
I'M SORRY.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.975
NOTHING.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.076
IT'S LIKE IF WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT MUSIC

15:10.109 --> 15:12.111
AND YOU SAID THAT YOUR FAVORITE
SINGER WAS KATY PERRY.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.080
KATY PERRY IS
MY FAVORITE SINGER.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.984
[laughs]
ARE YOU--

15:17.017 --> 15:18.317
[bizarre music plays]
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.319
SHH.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.990
*

15:23.023 --> 15:24.224
WELCOME, EVERYONE,
AND THANK YOU.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.425
(Danny)
SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.995
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
WAS TO THROW THIS IN MY FACE.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.430
BE QUIET.
YOUR EX-WIFE IS ON THE TV.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.397
(Christina)
I'M A SURVIVOR.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.601
A SURVIVOR WHO CAME
OUT OF A VERY DARK TIME

15:34.634 --> 15:37.303
WITH A MAN FOCUSED
ON EXTINGUISHING MY LIGHT.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.238
WHAT?

15:39.271 --> 15:43.543
WELL, TONIGHT I SHINE
THE LIGHT ON HIM.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.012
OH.
OH.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.479
HE'S A MONSTER.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.480
OH, MY GOD.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.315
SHE'S CAPTURED HIS SOUL.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.550
(man)
WE ARE ANGELS
AND WE ARE DEVILS.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.551
WE ARE REBORN.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.553
WHAT?
SUCH DEPTH.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.156
SHE'S BROUGHT THE BEAUTY
OUT OF EVIL.
GENIUS.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.689
OKAY, ENOUGH.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.026
THAT'S ENOUGH. THIS IS DUMB.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.759
THIS IS NOT ART.

16:00.792 --> 16:01.994
EVERYTHING ON THESE WALLS--
I COULD'VE DONE THAT

16:02.028 --> 16:03.495
WITH MY PHONE.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.033
TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BOOBS.
I GUESS I'M AN ARTIST NOW TOO.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.667
[shutter clicks]

16:07.699 --> 16:09.601
OKAY, I'M GONNA DELETE THAT.
[phone chimes]

16:09.635 --> 16:10.703
I INSTAGRAMMED IT.
[phones chiming]

16:10.736 --> 16:12.138
DAMN IT. AH!
NO, DON'T LOOK.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.074
AH, GOT MY NEW HOLIDAY CARD.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.508
YES, IT WOULD BE
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING

16:16.543 --> 16:18.478
TO LIVE WITH THIS MAN.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.779
BUT HE'S A GOOD GUY,
AND I'M A GOOD GUY.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.014
AND I'M A GOOD GUY.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.349
(Peter)
AND SO AM I.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.518
NO YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE BOTH OKAY, FINE, MEH.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.520
I'M NOT AS ARTSY AND WELL-READ
AS I WISH I WAS.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.121
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN
I WAS VERY WELL-READ?

16:29.156 --> 16:31.024
WHEN I WAS STUDYING
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
TO BECOME A DOCTOR.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.792
YEAH.

16:33.825 --> 16:37.264
BET YOU DIDN'T THINK WITH THIS
BOD THAT I HAD A BRAIN TOO.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.464
AND PRETTY GOOD BOOBS.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.599
"NIP CITY" IS TRENDING.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.567
AND WHEN I'M NOT
DELIVERING BABIES

16:40.600 --> 16:43.603
SURE, I LIKE TO WATCH
REAL HOUSEWIVES

16:43.636 --> 16:45.072
OR LISTEN TO KATY PERRY.

16:45.105 --> 16:45.937
[all groaning]
OH, COME ON.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.806
DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T LIKE
KATY PERRY.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.709
YOU'RE BASING THIS ON--
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:49.741 --> 16:51.544
WAIT, WAIT,
WHY ARE YOU BOOING HER?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.446
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T QUENCH
YOUR THIRST FOR PORNOGRAPHY?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.117
I GET IT. HOLD THIS.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.218
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SICK OF IT.
I'M SICK OF IT.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.020
YOU CAME HERE TONIGHT FOR THIS.
THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.156
'CAUSE I'LL
GIVE IT TO YOU.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.391
[all shouting]

17:04.423 --> 17:06.492
PERFORMANCE ART! YES!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.194
NO, I WANNA TAKE IT OUT.
YOU ARE DRUNK.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.263
YOU'RE ACTING TERRIBLY.
STOP IT.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.432
[both clear throat]

17:12.464 --> 17:15.768
WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.409
SO WHEN THE PHOTOS ARE DISPLAYED
AGAINST MY WILL IT'S ART,

17:22.441 --> 17:23.843
BUT WHEN I TAKE OUT
THE REAL THING

17:23.875 --> 17:25.811
SOMEHOW I'M SOME
KIND OF PERVERT?

17:25.845 --> 17:26.812
THAT IS A GOOD POINT.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.082
NO, IT'S NOT
A GOOD POINT, MINDY.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.617
LET ME DO THE LAWYER STUFF.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.818
OFFICERS, NOTHING REALLY
HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.155
RIGHT?
NO ONE'S PRESSING CHARGES.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.725
I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS
MRS. FERGUSON IS WHO DIALED 911,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.327
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST CHALK THIS UP

17:40.359 --> 17:42.294
TO FESTERING EMOTIONS
BETWEEN FORMER LOVERS.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.362
I KNOW HOW THAT IS.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.664
YEAH.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.733
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?
DON'T START
WITH ME, VICKI.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.735
OH, I'M GONNA START,
TERRY.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.470
CLIFF, I WANT TO THANK YOU.
WHAT DO WE OWE YOU?

17:51.503 --> 17:53.240
WELL, LET'S SEE,
AT MY NORMAL RATE IT WOULD BE

17:53.273 --> 17:54.774
RIGHT AROUND $7,000.

17:54.806 --> 17:56.442
NOPE.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.145
BUT THIS WAS
AN ENTERTAINING NIGHT,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.811
SO WHY DON'T WE
CALL IT PRO BONO

17:59.846 --> 18:03.450
FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED
MANHATTAN DOCTORS?

18:03.482 --> 18:06.486
HEY, THANK YOU.
YEAH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.221
YOU LOOKING FOR
YOUR GUY FRIEND?
YEAH.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.788
I THINK HE LEFT.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.824
THE PUBLIC INDECENCY
AND THE POLICE SHOWING UP

18:11.857 --> 18:12.858
IS A LOT FOR
A SECOND DATE.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.327
THAT'S REALLY MORE
THIRD DATE STUFF.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.863
(Peter)
HEY, DANNY, I BOUGHT THIS!

18:17.897 --> 18:18.797
WHAT PART OF YOU IS IT?

18:18.831 --> 18:21.134
MY BUDDY'S HOLDING
A PICTURE OF MY BUTT.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.170
YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY DON'T WE
GET YOU SOME MORE COFFEE?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.771
GET YOU OUT OF THIS ROOM?
COME ON.

18:24.803 --> 18:25.838
ALL RIGHT, SHORTY.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.806
WHAT DO YOU SAY ME AND YOU
GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.108
NO, THANK YOU.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.548
HEY, DANNY.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.286
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU
WITH ALL YOUR CLOTHES ON.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.720
OKAY, THAT'S VERY
INSENSITIVE,

18:40.753 --> 18:43.723
GIVEN MY CIRCUMSTANCES
RIGHT NOW.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.725
CAN I HAVE A PUFF?
THANKS.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.394
THAT'S STUPID.
YOU SHOULDN'T SMOKE.
HEY.

18:47.426 --> 18:48.895
I'M A JOKE.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.529
YOU'RE NOT A JOKE, DANNY.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.731
YOU HAVE TO BE FUNNY
TO BE A JOKE.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.799
I SHOULD MOVE.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.801
SOMEPLACE WHERE
THERE'S NO ART.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.803
LIKE IRAN OR UTAH.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.969
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:58.003 --> 19:00.907
EVERYONE CAME HERE TONIGHT
TO SEE PHOTOS OF YOUR HOT BODY.

19:00.939 --> 19:01.140
AND THEY CALLED IT ART.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.910
YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE
SAYING ABOUT MY BOOBS ONLINE?

19:04.943 --> 19:06.346
THEY'RE CALLING THEM
"HANDSOME."

19:06.378 --> 19:07.347
THEY DID?

19:07.379 --> 19:09.748
DON'T.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.250
YOU THINK MY BODY'S HOT?

19:11.283 --> 19:12.584
UGH, YOU KNOW THAT IT IS.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.853
THE GUYS AT THE GYM--

19:14.887 --> 19:17.224
YOU KNOW, THEY MAKE COMMENTS,
BUT THEY'RE FLIRTS.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.259
GREAT.
[sighs]

19:19.291 --> 19:21.627
I GOTTA TELL YOU I REALLY
LIKE THAT CLIFF GUY.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.829
HE'S COOL.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.765
I MEAN, HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND,
BUT I COULDN'T HELP BUT WONDER--

19:25.797 --> 19:27.767
I MEAN I'D LIKE HIM
TO BE MY FRIEND.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.501
OKAY, GOD, COOL IT.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.904
DANNY, RIGHT?
FROM THE PHOTOS?
YEAH.

19:31.937 --> 19:32.905
YEAH, JUST KEEP MOVING.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.573
HE HAD A HARD NIGHT.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.677
I THOUGHT THEY
WERE TERRIFIC.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.516
OKAY GO.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.651
YOU OBVIOUSLY
WANT TO GO, JUST GO.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.586
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

19:47.619 --> 19:51.458
GO. JUST--
ALL RIGHT.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.261
DR. DANIEL CASTELLANO.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.396
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.497
WHAT WAS YOUR
FAVORITE PHOTO?

20:02.335 --> 20:05.338
[baby laughing on phone]

20:08.507 --> 20:09.841
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:09.875 --> 20:13.312
UH, I CAME TO TALK TO YOU.

20:13.345 --> 20:15.847
I'M ACTUALLY BUSY
WATCHING A VIDEO ONLINE

20:15.881 --> 20:18.318
OF A BABY WHO'S STARTLED
BY ITS OWN FART.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.150
[baby farts, laughs]

20:19.184 --> 20:21.020
MINDY, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

20:21.052 --> 20:23.456
YOU, UM...

20:23.489 --> 20:25.924
YOU INVITED ME
TO AN ART OPENING

20:25.958 --> 20:27.794
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THAT
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE.

20:27.827 --> 20:32.431
AND I WAS RUDE...
AND A JUDGMENTAL SNOB.

20:32.465 --> 20:37.437
LIKE JAMES SPADER
IN PRETTY IN PINK.

20:37.469 --> 20:40.807
I'M SORRY, DID YOU JUST
MAKE A POP CULTURE REFERENCE?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.609
YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.611
[clears throat]

20:45.644 --> 20:49.749
[plays ukulele]

20:49.782 --> 20:53.853
* YOU THINK I'M PRETTY
WITHOUT ANY MAKEUP ON *

20:53.886 --> 20:55.021
* YOU THINK I'M FUNNY

20:55.053 --> 20:58.358
* WHEN I TELL
THE PUNCH LINE WRONG *

20:58.391 --> 21:01.260
* I KNOW YOU GET ME
SO I LET MY WALLS COME DOWN *

21:01.260 --> 21:02.829
* DOWN

21:02.862 --> 21:05.931
UGH. THAT IS SO CLICHE.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.933
[laughs]

21:07.967 --> 21:10.637
OH, NO. MINDY,
IF YOU COULD JUST--ONE--

21:10.670 --> 21:12.371
ONE MORE VERSE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.372
IT REALLY TOOK A LONG TIME
TO LEARN THIS, SO...

21:13.405 --> 21:14.841
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

21:14.873 --> 21:15.842
I MEAN,
I DON'T MEAN TO--
NO, NO.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.076
* WHEN YOU MET ME

21:17.109 --> 21:18.845
* I WAS ALL RIGHT,
BUT THINGS GOT-- *

21:18.878 --> 21:20.847
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS SILLY,
I CAN DO THIS LATER.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.016
[chuckles]

21:29.522 --> 21:30.790
[baby farts, laughs]

21:30.823 --> 21:32.859
GO TO BED.
