WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.038
all: * It is well

00:04.072 --> 00:07.075
* With my soul

00:07.108 --> 00:08.642
- Great--
unintentionally modern,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.511
but we'll get back to it
next week.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.513
- Oh, hold on.
We got one more song.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.983
- * Arthur
- * Arthur

00:16.016 --> 00:17.185
- * Arthur

00:17.218 --> 00:18.319
- * Arthur

00:18.352 --> 00:19.720
- I hate barbershop quartets.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.357
- * There's a turkey
we've been carving *

00:23.391 --> 00:24.525
* For you

00:24.558 --> 00:26.694
So awkward.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.695
- * And we thought

00:27.728 --> 00:32.166
* You might be starving, too

00:32.200 --> 00:33.401
all: * Arthur

00:33.434 --> 00:35.403
- * Please join us
on Thanksgiving night *

00:35.436 --> 00:37.205
* My Brussels sprouts
are out of sight *

00:37.238 --> 00:38.772
- And it just keeps goes on.

00:38.806 --> 00:43.577
- * Please RSVP

00:43.611 --> 00:46.046
- Okay.
Very good.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.681
That one, you rehearsed.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.084
- Before you say no--
- No.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.452
- Okay, after you say no,

00:51.485 --> 00:53.621
we do a super fun
progressive dinner

00:53.654 --> 00:55.756
where we do a different course
at each other's houses.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.192
- Progressive and Kentucky
go together

00:58.226 --> 01:00.094
about as well
as C and a F sharp.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.730
They're dissonant.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.598
- We also start the day
by making meals to go

01:04.632 --> 01:05.799
for church members in need.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.601
Is that progressive enough
for you?

01:07.635 --> 01:10.204
- That part I will do,
but then I have to get home.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.773
I have a date
with a very special video

01:12.806 --> 01:14.875
that I have been tracking down
for two months.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.644
- Yep, the world
would be a better place

01:16.677 --> 01:18.612
if people just admit
they watch porn.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.548
- What?
No, no.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.283
It is a rare bootleg recording

01:22.316 --> 01:23.884
of Sir Thomas Beecham's
production

01:23.917 --> 01:26.420
of Mozart's
"The Magic Flute."

01:26.454 --> 01:28.722
- Oh, the old magic flute, huh?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.424
I never heard that one before.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.625
- Can we not?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.294
- Hey, listen,
you should not be alone

01:33.327 --> 01:35.129
on your first holiday
without your wife.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.430
- I won't be alone.

01:36.464 --> 01:40.334
I'll be with
Sarastro and Papageno

01:40.368 --> 01:41.535
and Lafite Rothschild.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.805
It's two characters
from "The Magic Flute"

01:44.838 --> 01:46.407
and a Bordeaux blend.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.742
Nobody likes this side of you.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.746
choir: * Hallelujah,
Thine the glory *

01:52.780 --> 01:58.419
* Revive us again

01:58.452 --> 02:00.188
- All right.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.922
Wow, Dwayne,
spandex at church--

02:01.955 --> 02:02.923
that's brave.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.858
- Arthur,
the good Lord blessed me

02:04.892 --> 02:06.860
with the legs
that fill out these tights.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.629
Good to see you
at the Turkey Trot.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.531
- Well, you know,
I didn't mean to participate,

02:10.564 --> 02:13.534
but the one road in this town
was shut down for the race,

02:13.567 --> 02:14.868
so I had to walk here.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.471
I ended up winning
my age group.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.540
The Seasoned Turkeys.
- Ooh.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.708
- Okay, let's divide these up

02:20.741 --> 02:22.276
and start making
our deliveries.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.378
- All right,
I will take this one

02:24.412 --> 02:26.980
to the widower who lives alone
on the houseboat.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.782
- There's a widower
lives alone on a houseboat?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.618
You guys should be friends.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.985
Oh, I see what you're doing.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.822
- Hey, where is my bag?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.624
- What bag?
What'd it look like?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.859
- You know, broken in, manly,

02:38.892 --> 02:40.294
a few cracks in the leather,
like me.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.695
- Are you sure you brought it?

02:41.729 --> 02:43.464
'Cause sometimes I think
I brushed my teeth,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.466
and, well, I didn't.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.801
- Yeah, no, it was here
ten seconds ago.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.969
One of you must have taken it.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.404
- Excuse me.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.872
Are you accusing us
of stealing?

02:51.905 --> 02:53.374
- Well,
either one of you took it

02:53.407 --> 02:54.808
or it's the only thing
in this town

02:54.842 --> 02:56.009
worth getting raptured.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.645
- Oh.
- Okay, you know what?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.747
I think I saw it in my office.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.316
- Oh, good.
My computer's in there.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.484
Oh, please.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.587
- Where is that bag?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.556
Okay, it's not in my office.
That was a trick.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.690
Smiling at you was my tell.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.559
Wait, I wanted to stop you

03:11.592 --> 03:13.527
before you went
full TSA out there.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.029
Actually, I've had
a few things disappear too

03:16.063 --> 03:18.866
like my Princess Diana
commemorative plate.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.701
- So there is a thief
in our midst.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.069
What is the etiquette
on how long

03:22.102 --> 03:23.837
we have to wait
before we say it's Wayne?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.038
- Now, Arth--
- Wait.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.874
Wayne and Dwayne's house
is a stop

03:26.907 --> 03:28.709
on this progressive
dinner thing, right?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.110
- Yeah, it's the first one,
but please.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.712
Don't let this ruin
our Thanksgiving.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.013
You can deal with it tomorrow.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.682
- Or I can toss Wayne's house

03:34.715 --> 03:36.417
like the crime scene
that it is.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.386
- In the Bible,
it says that we should--

03:38.419 --> 03:40.754
- Yada yada, be calm,
blah-blah, slow to anger?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.723
- Oh, yeah.
You've almost got James 1:19.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.057
I'll lend you
my Bible flash cards.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.694
Who took my flash cards?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.532
- Hey, everybody,
I am so sorry for my outburst.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.934
I got upset because
my "Magic Flute" file

03:53.967 --> 03:56.437
was on my computer,
but I can watch that anytime.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.607
Tonight, this Seasoned Turkey
is eating with you.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.442
-  Whoo!
- All right, Arthur.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.744
- Good choice, buddy.
We're gonna fill you up.

04:03.777 --> 04:04.745
- There you go.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.915
- Hello, hello, hello.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.552
This is my contractor, Karl,
who'll be joining us today.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.120
Ginny, Karl.
Karl, Ginny.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.923
- You guys are both Libras

04:15.956 --> 04:17.791
and love Maroon 5
for some reason.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.727
- Hey.
- Oh, look at that.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.128
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.129
- You too.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.071
- Would you excuse us
for a second?

04:32.540 --> 04:33.841
You cannot set me up

04:33.874 --> 04:35.809
without a warning.
I'm not ready.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.845
- Somebody's got to be
your first pancake.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.613
- Is that a sex thing?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.114
Because there are some things
that I just will not do

04:41.148 --> 04:42.983
unless I am celebrating
a birthday.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.518
- When you make pancakes,

04:44.552 --> 04:45.853
no matter how
you heat the griddle,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.788
the first one
is never quite right.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.690
But you have to get it
out of the way

04:49.723 --> 04:51.158
so you can move on.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.694
- Oh.
Moving on does sound nice.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.296
- Stop obsessing
over Dwayne and Wayne

04:56.330 --> 05:00.133
and go take a bite
out of that.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.603
- First pancake.
I got this.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.704
- You do.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.708
- Hello, Karl.
- Hey.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.210
- Would you excuse me
for a second?

05:10.243 --> 05:11.311
I don't got this.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.846
I'm gonna throw up.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.885
- First course--
hot brown sliders.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.019
Mmm.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.654
- Hot browns?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.123
Well, they look better
than they sound.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.625
Then again, they had to.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.993
- Typically,
it's a turkey sandwich

05:26.026 --> 05:27.695
drizzled in Mornay sauce.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.229
- Yeah, my goat cheese
is what makes 'em sing.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.365
- Ooh, yes please,
main squeeze.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.301
- You got it,
my little sweet potato pie.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.069
- Mmm.
- Ooh, fun.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.071
Arthur--
- No, no--

05:40.007 --> 05:41.675
Actually,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.143
I don't hate that.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.878
Don't ever do that again.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.014
I'm gonna go look
for the computer.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.149
Papageno, here I come.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.352
- So Thanksgiving, huh?
- Yeah.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.821
- Did you know that
some people don't celebrate

05:53.854 --> 05:55.222
on account of what we did
to the Native Americans--

05:55.255 --> 05:57.858
which I fully support,
by the way--

05:57.891 --> 05:58.926
the people, not what we did.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.028
I wonder if I'm part
Native American.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.230
You know, I haven't done my 23
and Me yet 'cause I'm scared.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.733
They say the FBI
is collecting our DNA

06:05.766 --> 06:08.168
to clone us after the purge.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.371
Huh, what's that?
I'm sorry?

06:11.405 --> 06:14.341
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.176
- Hey, so is that a set up?

06:16.209 --> 06:18.011
- 'Cause he is cute.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.347
You should let me help you.
I am so good at this stuff.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.115
Look at me and Dwayne.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.218
- Oh.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.287
Isn't that sweet?
He's saving a kiss for later

06:27.320 --> 06:29.222
even though you guys make out
in public all the time.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.094
- Ugh, come on.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.096
Whoa.
- What are you doing?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.098
- More importantly,

06:38.131 --> 06:41.435
what were you doing, big guy?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.437
- Okay, I was young and broke,

06:43.471 --> 06:44.772
and an agent spotted me
in the mall,

06:44.805 --> 06:46.073
and the next thing I know,

06:46.106 --> 06:48.108
I was on the cover
of a Japanese romance novel.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.376
- What was it about?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.945
- The title loosely translates
to "Sex Horse."

06:54.247 --> 06:55.483
What are you doing
snooping around in my things?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.217
- Uh--
- Who's snooping?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.386
Snooping's my thing.
Oh.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.288
Konnichiwa, Sei-Ba.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.556
- Unexpected.
- Wait.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.424
Do you think
I stole your laptop?

07:04.458 --> 07:05.826
- I think Wayne did.

07:05.859 --> 07:06.994
- Just cause I don't know
how to manage money

07:07.027 --> 07:09.463
and I've yet to return
Jax's Diana plate?

07:09.497 --> 07:10.931
- Yeah.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.232
- You know, it's not just
poor people who steal.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.469
Could be some rich person
doing it for a cheap thrill.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.070
Think on that.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.008
- Dwayne, we're running out
of toilet paper

07:21.041 --> 07:22.342
and going through those
Chipotle napkins real quick.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.611
What is that?
- Nothing.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.012
- What do you have?
- Nothing, baby.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.614
- Can I see it, please?
What--

07:26.647 --> 07:29.583
wait, Dwayne, is that you
as a sexy sex stallion?

07:29.617 --> 07:32.252
- Actually, it's a sex horse.
Let me explain--

07:32.285 --> 07:33.621
- Shh.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.856
Sex stallions don't talk.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.290
Mmm.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.526
- Oh, my God.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.927
Get in here.
- Whoa!

07:39.960 --> 07:42.162
- Just drop the book.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.097
- Maybe we should go.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.332
- Yeah.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.935
- So that happened.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.537
I'm sorry.
I've always wanted to say that.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.972
- Do you think Adams
might have stolen my laptop?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.542
You know,
successful woman, has it all,

07:54.575 --> 07:56.944
just wants to feel something...

07:56.977 --> 07:58.478
Like Winona Ryder--

07:58.512 --> 08:00.514
you know, from that movie
my missionary parents called,

08:00.548 --> 08:02.616
"Girls Named Heather
Go to Hell Together."

08:02.650 --> 08:04.184
No, I don't believe it.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.154
- I look forward to destroying
your faith in humanity.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.388
We're going to Adams' house
next, right?

08:08.421 --> 08:09.657
I can snoop around then.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.961
- Maybe we should go now.
- Yeah.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.462
- Okay, guys, next stop.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.967
- Wow, this is great.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.402
Please don't tell me
there's squirrel brains in this.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.971
- No.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.673
Did you say brains or bowels?

08:25.706 --> 08:28.475
- It's a Kentucky delicacy
we call burgoo.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.978
As they say,
if it walked, crawled,

08:31.011 --> 08:33.681
or was hit by a Subaru,
it goes in burgoo.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.649
- So basically,
this is roadkill soup.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.351
- No.
It's more of a roadkill bisque.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.721
- Hey, where's Georgia?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.189
She's not gonna miss the--

08:42.222 --> 08:43.757
"Maaane" event, is she?

08:43.791 --> 08:46.093
- She stopped at her cousins.
She'll be here soon.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.361
- Oh, good, because
I didn't get to say "hay."

08:48.395 --> 08:50.063
That's A-Y, not E-Y.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.499
You know, for a horse.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.235
- This is why I don't like
people seeing that book.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.503
Easy now.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.705
You want a sugar cube?
Huh?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.172
Big guy like you?
I'll get you two.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.075
- How's it going with
"Tryin' Gosling"?

09:02.109 --> 09:03.343
- I think I forgot
how to flirt.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.445
I haven't dated since college.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.047
Where all my friends went
to college.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.548
I didn't go to college.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.718
- What is the classic
Kentucky mating ritual?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
Yodeling atop a mountain

09:12.285 --> 09:14.087
to indicate you're open
to a courtin'?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.756
- That is insulting.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.524
But I will take
the spirit of your advice

09:17.557 --> 09:20.460
and do something awesome
to get his attention.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.139
- Hey.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.741
Get away from me, kid.
I don't wanna get caught again.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.475
- You know
who never gets caught?

09:35.508 --> 09:38.646
A kid--especially ones
with dimples like these.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.281
- Okay, 10 bucks
if you find my computer.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.315
- 30.
- 15.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.785
20 and I'll actually try.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.754
- If you get caught,
you don't know me.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.658
Beat it.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.159
- Uh-oh.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.493
- Hey, you need some help?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.428
- How perceptive of you
to notice.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.631
I was just trying to get
this candle from--

09:57.665 --> 09:59.667
- Oh--oh, my God.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.434
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

10:01.468 --> 10:02.803
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah, you sure?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.171
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

10:04.204 --> 10:05.639
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- All right.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.174
- Mm-hmm, I'm great.
I'm good.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.242
I'm fine--I mean,
I will be fine.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.343
- Good.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.479
Well, took me a week
to install that cabinet.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.915
I guess I'll just start over.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.250
- But you're excited 'cause
you love a good challenge?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.551
- No.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.455
- Ah.
Ugh.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.657
Ow.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.858
- Hey, what was that noise?

10:24.892 --> 10:26.526
- The lady was flirting with me,
fell off a shelf.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.695
- Ginny was flirting with you?

10:27.728 --> 10:28.862
- Yeah, which is weird,

10:28.896 --> 10:29.963
'cause I'm here
as her best friend's date.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.264
Well, that can't be,

10:31.298 --> 10:32.599
'cause I'm not just
her ex-husband.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.534
I'm her best friend.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.838
- Adams.
I'm here with Adams.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.506
- Oh, yeah.
That checks out.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.678
- You okay?
- Mm--

10:44.712 --> 10:47.781
Yeah, there's just
something crunchy

10:47.815 --> 10:49.717
floating around in there.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.685
I'm gonna go home
and check on the turkey.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.321
And take more than the
recommended dosage of Ibuprofen.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.622
I'll see you in a bit.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.990
Ah, ah!

10:57.024 --> 10:58.291
- Here, here, here.
Let me give you a hand.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.527
- Ooh, thanks.
- Oh, wow.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.528
What happened here?

11:01.561 --> 11:02.896
- Ginny hurt her knee--

11:02.930 --> 11:05.298
- And I just need a little help
going home.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.467
- Oh, okay, well, don't take
Dwayne away from his friends,

11:07.500 --> 11:08.501
I'ma drive you.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.536
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.537
- Thanks.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.972
- Ow.
- Oh, no, what'd you do?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.007
- No, it just hurts when I put
pressure on it right there.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.809
- Well, stop doing it.
- Okay.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.711
- Cassius Clay Hawlings,

11:17.745 --> 11:19.679
are you snooping around
in my cabinets?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.915
- Well, I'm sure there's
an innocent explanation.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.351
You know boys
and interior decorating.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.720
- Auntie Adams, the truth is...

11:29.589 --> 11:32.726
The truth is,
I'm just a child of a divorce

11:32.760 --> 11:34.895
and holidays
can be tough on me.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.865
- Oh, sweetie.
Oh.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.433
Let's get you a cookie,
and when you get older,

11:40.467 --> 11:42.702
Auntie Adams
will introduce you to bourbon,

11:42.736 --> 11:44.604
and bourbon goes great
with cookies.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.045
- You know, I think I know
what your problem is.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.882
You got bad romantic feng shui.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.116
- Say what now?
- Mm, yeah.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.717
The objects in your home

11:57.751 --> 11:59.920
are blocking you
from finding love.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.122
Okay, step one.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.858
Declutter to make room
for new romance.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.026
-  Hey, no!

12:06.059 --> 12:08.128
That's my plastic bag
of plastic bags.

12:08.161 --> 12:12.699
- Step two, get rid of reminders
of old relationships.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.868
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.804
I earned this.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.106
Hey, why are you so invested
in helping me with my love life?

12:19.139 --> 12:20.573
- You want the truth?
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.776
- I think you and Dwayne
are a little too close.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.444
I would feel a lot better

12:24.477 --> 12:26.446
if you had your
own relationship--

12:26.479 --> 12:27.614
and if you washed your hands,

12:27.647 --> 12:29.149
'cause you just reached
into the trash.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.652
- Are you accusing me
of trying to steal your man?

12:32.685 --> 12:34.754
The audacity.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.890
- I think you mean
the accuracy.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.625
And are you seriously
not gonna wash your hands?

12:38.658 --> 12:39.626
I mean, it's just gross.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.761
- It will be a cold day
in hell--

12:41.795 --> 12:44.131
- Hello.
- Hello, everybody.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.799
Welcome.
- Hey, y'all.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.902
- Ooh, is this plastic bag
of plastic bags up for grabs?

12:48.936 --> 12:49.937
- No.
- Yes.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.671
- Happy Thanksgiving.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.516
- Heya, good news.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.784
Guess who's got two thumbs

13:04.818 --> 13:06.019
and full range of motion
in her knee?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.822
- Everyone here?
- Mm-hmm, and this girl.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.194
- Hey, guess who has two thumbs
and likes your "this girl" bit.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.262
- Everybody here?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.030
No.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.531
I'm pretty sure it's just me.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.133
But I think you might be

13:20.167 --> 13:21.969
barking up the wrong tree
with this guy.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.937
- Oh, please.
You think everybody's gay.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.273
- True, and that's okay, but--
- You know what?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.875
Everybody's got an opinion
on my love life,

13:27.908 --> 13:29.342
and I don't wanna hear it--

13:29.376 --> 13:30.878
especially from a guy

13:30.911 --> 13:33.713
who thinks that corn nuts
are an aphrodisiac.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.117
- I mean, I'll send you
some articles.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.154
-  Doo, doo-doo,
doo-doo, doo, doo.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.291
- Hey, I was thinking,
and it just doesn't seem right

13:44.324 --> 13:46.994
to be snooping in my own house

13:47.027 --> 13:49.162
for less than another $20.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.131
- Oh, you're robbing me blind.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.301
Hey, did you steal my computer?
- I'm a hustler, not a thief.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.668
- Yeah?
Why should I believe you?

13:55.702 --> 13:56.703
- Just give me your phone.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.138
- What,
so you can steal it, too?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.839
- No, so I can use
the "Find My Computer" app.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.174
- If you knew
how to find my computer,

14:01.208 --> 14:02.375
why didn't you tell me earlier?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.811
- Because I was hustling you.
Keep up, old man.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.980
- I can't tell
if you're destined for juvie

14:07.014 --> 14:08.916
or the White House.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.084
Walk away.
- Hey.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.258
- Karl, are you leaving?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.194
- Hey, uh, yeah.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.330
Sorry.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.699
Just been kind of
a weird night, you know?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.101
I mean, you invited me here
as your date

14:28.135 --> 14:30.070
and then completely ignored me
all night.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.273
And your friend Ginny
won't stop flirting with me.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.875
No offense.
She really sucks at it.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.344
- Wait, my date?

14:37.377 --> 14:40.213
I invited you here
as Ginny's date.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.749
- I don't like Ginny.
I like you.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.717
- Oh.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.219
Oh.
- Yeah.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.887
- Well, I just figured
I was too old for you.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.089
I mean, I must be at least...

14:49.122 --> 14:50.423
Years older than you.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.760
- Whatever age you are,

14:53.793 --> 14:54.894
it's perfect.

14:54.928 --> 14:58.031
- Now that's how you flirt.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.234
- Turkey's ready!

15:01.268 --> 15:03.303
Where's Karl?
- Oh, he just stepped outside.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.272
- Oh.
- Oh, no, Ginny, listen.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.140
I don't think he's a good match
for you because--

15:07.174 --> 15:09.109
- Hey, just 'cause you're lonely
on Thanksgiving doesn't mean

15:09.142 --> 15:11.011
you gotta ruin what
I've got going on with Karl.

15:12.812 --> 15:13.947
Oh!

15:13.981 --> 15:16.783
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.986
- Okay.
- Wow, okay.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.821
- I thought you brought him
for me.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.090
- I thought so, too--
- Wait, so,

15:23.123 --> 15:24.924
Ginny's trying to steal
someone else's man?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.093
What a shocker.
- What?

15:26.126 --> 15:28.795
- People stealing
lovers and laptops.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.497
This choir is suddenly
a cornucopia

15:30.530 --> 15:32.399
of scandal and intrigue.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.002
You really can't say cornucopia
any other time of year.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.403
- Wait,
are you just still accusing us

15:36.436 --> 15:37.837
of stealing your laptop?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.172
- Yes.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.508
- What man is Ginny stealing?
That doesn't sound like her.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.243
- Oh, and now
you're taking her side.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.511
Another shocker.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.946
- Who wants to make
pinecone turkeys?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.849
- Now hold on a minute.
- I have a Gucci soup ladle.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.184
Why would I steal
your crappy old laptop?

15:51.218 --> 15:52.319
- Hm, interesting.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.321
He never said it was
crappy or old.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.256
- Everything he owns
is crappy and old.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.857
It was an inference.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.293
- Yeah, well,
I don't know what that means.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.329
- What is that?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.031
- Burning?
- Oh, it's the smoke alarm?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.365
- Ah!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.334
Maybe we should start
with a prayer.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.968
- Found it!
- And ask God--

16:09.002 --> 16:10.370
- What the hell?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.273
Funny story.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.974
I've got your laptop.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.976
- You stole my laptop.

16:17.010 --> 16:20.113
- I think it was more of
a benign pastoral interference--

16:20.147 --> 16:21.481
a BPI.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.650
It was the only way
to get you to join us today.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.285
- Could I have been more clear?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.188
All I wanted to do today
was watch an opera,

16:28.221 --> 16:31.191
not be part of a soap opera.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.459
- Am I the handsome leading man

16:32.492 --> 16:35.562
or the handsome man's
evil twin brother, Scott?

16:35.595 --> 16:38.165
- You're in a coma.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.005
- I had no idea

16:46.039 --> 16:48.241
Karl was interested in me
when I invited him.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.243
You know I wouldn't
do that to you.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.678
- I know.

16:51.711 --> 16:55.215
And you did warn me
about my first pancake.

16:55.248 --> 16:59.219
I'm just startin' to wonder.
Maybe I'm no good at this.

16:59.252 --> 17:03.323
Maybe all my pancakes are bad,
you know--

17:03.356 --> 17:07.327
raw around the edges
and all crunchy in the middle.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.529
You're a catch.

17:09.562 --> 17:14.201
You are smart and charming.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.769
Didn't you tell me Georgia
threw that in the trash?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.539
- Oh, the alcohol
sterilizes it.

17:19.572 --> 17:23.276
- Soap.
Soap sterilizes it.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.352
- I'd tell you to go away,

17:32.385 --> 17:35.122
but it's clear you don't
respect people's wishes.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.257
- I'm sorry I stole your laptop.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.726
Actually, I prefer the term
"took" instead of "stole."

17:39.759 --> 17:41.628
Sounds less like a sin.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.430
I just didn't want you
to be home alone today,

17:43.463 --> 17:45.265
but it's not my place

17:45.298 --> 17:46.766
to second guess
what's best for you.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.236
- No, you were right.

17:49.269 --> 17:53.806
I've been alone for 20 minutes,
and I'm miserable,

17:53.840 --> 17:55.808
which was sort of my plan.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.144
- What do you mean?

17:57.177 --> 18:00.280
- I was gonna stay home,
watch an opera,

18:00.313 --> 18:03.383
get drunk,
think about Jean.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.586
- And instead you feel guilty
because you had fun with us.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.255
- Fun?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.323
Getting grifted by a kid,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.425
getting caught up
in a love triangle,

18:12.459 --> 18:16.163
finding out that a member
of your choir is a sex horse...

18:17.830 --> 18:20.833
Yes, I did.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.902
I had so much fun.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.405
- Well, from everything
you've said about Jean,

18:25.438 --> 18:27.407
she seemed like
a fun-loving person

18:27.440 --> 18:30.510
who would want you
to live a joyful life.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.811
Maybe the real way
to honor Jean

18:31.844 --> 18:34.247
is by having
a good time with us.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.349
It's too bad
that I left everyone.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.784
- Well,
maybe it's not too late.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.919
- They're all here, aren't they?
- Caw caw!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.621
- I thought I smelled Wayne.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.290
- Aw!

18:43.323 --> 18:45.792
Surprise!
- Hi!

18:45.825 --> 18:48.195
- Whoo!
- All right.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.796
- Where are your plates,
forks, and napkins?

18:49.829 --> 18:51.964
- You mean my plate, my fork,
and my shirt sleeve?

18:51.998 --> 18:53.666
- We're eating
with our hands, people.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.701
- Yes, we are.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.469
- Way ahead of you.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.771
Fingers are the forks
of the body.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.541
- You tried to tell me the truth
earlier and I shut you down.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.009
I'm sorry.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.945
- I'm your Waffle House.
You can never shut me down.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.281
- Thanks for having
my back 24-7.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.783
- Hey, being alone
on the holidays

19:10.817 --> 19:12.018
can make a person crazy.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.353
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.687
- Here's to figuring it out
together.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.456
- Mm-hmm.
Mm.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.724
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.826
- Hi.
Oh, where's Georgia?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.694
I hate leaving things
on bad terms.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.962
That's why I'm Facebook friends

19:22.995 --> 19:24.631
with that guy
who sideswiped me.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.467
- Georgia decided to skip
this course

19:27.500 --> 19:28.835
and our future together.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.471
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.805
- Go ahead.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.575
- I guess she wasn't into
stable relationships,

19:35.608 --> 19:38.545
so she put you out to pasture.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.380
And there's also something
about Mister Ed,

19:40.413 --> 19:41.681
but I haven't
figured it out yet.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.015
Damn it.
- Okay, attention everyone.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.386
It's time to join hands.
Come, come, come.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.720
Come on.
Hands.

19:47.754 --> 19:54.527
* Ooh

19:54.561 --> 19:56.996
- I'm grateful to God for his...
all: * Praise God...

19:57.029 --> 19:59.432
- Famously-lenient stance
on fibbing.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.002
- And also for all of you.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.705
- I'm thankful to God 'cause
now I have enough money

20:05.738 --> 20:07.707
to buy a new controller
so I can play "Fortnite."

20:07.740 --> 20:09.709
- And I'm grateful to have a son

20:09.742 --> 20:12.044
who's gonna share
that new controller with me

20:12.078 --> 20:13.613
so I can play "Fortnite."

20:15.948 --> 20:19.419
I am grateful
for good friends...

20:19.452 --> 20:21.921
all:

20:21.954 --> 20:23.956
- And that dating apps
make it clear

20:23.990 --> 20:26.626
who is on a date with whom.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.929
- I'm grateful to God
for being a provider

20:29.962 --> 20:33.600
of rough hands
and strong backs, Lord.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.067
- I'm grateful
I have good friends

20:35.101 --> 20:36.769
who can support me
when I'm down--

20:36.803 --> 20:38.705
- Mr. Sex Ed!

20:38.738 --> 20:40.573
Nailed it.

20:40.607 --> 20:44.110
- Well, I can't thank God
because I don't believe in him,

20:44.143 --> 20:48.080
but I am grateful to have
a friend like Reverend Jax

20:48.114 --> 20:52.084
who is stubborn, persistent,

20:52.118 --> 20:55.121
and knows what I need
more than I do.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.756
But don't take that
as an invitation

20:56.789 --> 20:59.158
to steal anymore
of my stuff, okay?

20:59.191 --> 21:00.927
- Okay.

21:02.295 --> 21:05.298
all: * Amen

21:08.768 --> 21:11.103
- What did we just do?

21:11.137 --> 21:14.173
- Oh, you know what we did.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.009
Someone earned herself
another mug.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.680
Cash can never know
about this.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.181
- Okay,
but if you talk to Arthur,

21:22.214 --> 21:24.551
he's gonna learn about
the magic flute.
