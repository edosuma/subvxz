00:07.507 --> 00:09.843
Right? It seem like
they'd be choking all the time.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.469
Facts. Oh.

00:11.469 --> 00:12.929
- Hey, you want one?
- Yes, of course.

She was all over you.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.404

01:02.979 --> 01:04.689
- Whoa!
- What the hell?

01:04.689 --> 01:06.441
- What?
- You just gonna walk in here

01:06.441 --> 01:09.277
wearing a hat
and expect us not to react?

01:09.277 --> 01:10.570
I wanted to wear a hat.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.405
Sherm wears hats all the time.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.949
Don't bring me into this
crazy choice you made today.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.577
So I'm not much of a hat guy,
but, you know, I figured,

01:17.577 --> 01:19.829
why not now?
Life is short.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.915
So you're wearing a cap
because life is short?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.208
Yes.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.085
- That's stupid.
- Stupid...

01:25.085 --> 01:26.378
- No, it's stupid.
- It's just a hat.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.506
Okay, enough about
Anthony's insane clothing.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.008
- A hat is insane now?
- On your head, absolutely.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.260
So listen, okay, I've been
dating this guy named Clarke.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.887
He's very sexy.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.180
We've been getting along great.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.723
Sounds like
there's a "but" coming.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.016
No, there's not.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.310
So we've been
getting along great, however...

01:42.310 --> 01:43.478
"However"
is just a fancy "but."

01:43.478 --> 01:45.063
[sharply] However...

01:45.063 --> 01:46.773
he talks in his sleep.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.942
Ooh, interesting.
What he be talking about?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.944
Here's the thing:
I think it's about me.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.613
[muttering] Damn, Nicky,
why are you always so late?

01:53.613 --> 01:55.949
You're so damn late
all the damn time.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.283
Oh, my God.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.702
You do show up late sometimes.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.161
He's definitely
talking about you.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.705
I mean, it's so weird.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.956
Is it normal?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.374
It's called somniloquy.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.584
Sorry, I overheard you guys,
but I can tell you,

02:06.584 --> 02:08.294
it's a common form
of parasomnia

02:08.294 --> 02:09.838
whereby a person talks
in their sleep

02:09.838 --> 02:11.297
with no memory whatsoever.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.466
66% of people are gonna
talk in their sleep

02:13.466 --> 02:15.218
at some point in their life.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.469
Completely normal.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.638
Oh.
Well, thanks, nurse lady.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.098
- Thank you.
- Maybe you should

02:20.098 --> 02:21.474
talk to him
about the sleep stuff

02:21.474 --> 02:23.309
or just apologize
for the lateness.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.520
Nuh-uh, it is too early
in the relationship

02:25.520 --> 02:28.023
for me to be communicating
with my partner.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.315
[chuckles]
You're silly.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.192
Or you could just
not say anything,

02:31.192 --> 02:32.485
and then show up
on time next time,

02:32.485 --> 02:33.862
and, you know, keep it pushing.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.488
Thank you, Anthony.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.532
Finally, someone wants
to give me advice

02:37.532 --> 02:39.492
that I actually want to hear.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.287
This is a hot take,
but I like taxes.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.663
I want my roads to be smooth.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.915
Okay, I--I guess
that makes sense.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.083
Oh, Keith! Dale!

02:47.083 --> 02:48.501
- What's up, y'all?
- Hey.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.627
- How you doing, man?
- What's going on, man?

02:49.627 --> 02:50.837
- Good to see you.
- What's up, baby?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.213
- This my boy, Sherm.
- What's up, man?

02:52.213 --> 02:53.214
- Keith, man.
- From your group

02:53.214 --> 02:54.591
of single, hopeless friends?

02:54.591 --> 02:56.217
[laughter]

02:56.217 --> 02:57.260
I'll tell you one thing:

02:57.260 --> 02:58.720
it's good
y'all found wives early,

02:58.720 --> 02:59.596
'cause y'all ugly.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.639
- Okay.
- [laughs] A'ight.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.892
Aye, there go Keith again
with that goofy-ass laugh,

03:03.892 --> 03:05.143
sounding like a hyena.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.354
[both imitate laugh]

03:07.354 --> 03:08.730
And you shouldn't
be laughing, Wyatt.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.857
You look like you shop
at Brokes Brothers.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.525
He broke.
[laughter]

03:12.525 --> 03:14.152
Go ahead, Wyatt.
It's your turn, man.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.862
- Hit 'em with it.
- Okay, um...

03:15.862 --> 03:19.032
hey, Keith,
where'd you get those shoes?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.158
Brokes Brothers?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.326
Oh, no.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.911
Did you just recycle a roast?

03:22.911 --> 03:25.622
Uh, what he meant to say was,
when y'all get home tonight,

03:25.622 --> 03:27.832
make sure you leave those shoes
outside on the curb

03:27.832 --> 03:29.376
- 'cause they trash.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.044
[laughter]

03:31.044 --> 03:32.545
That's a good one, Sherm.
That's a good one.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.089
Hey, Wyatt, you should
have him come through

03:34.089 --> 03:36.174
to play spades this week
since Chuck's out of town.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.093
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
Uh, what you think, Sherm?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.178
Oh, yeah, man, I'll be there,
and get ready,

03:40.178 --> 03:41.596
'cause I'ma spank you
like your mamas should've.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.847
- Okay!
- Okay!

03:42.847 --> 03:44.974
[imitates switch crack]
"Mama!"

03:45.934 --> 03:47.811
Uh, okay. We'll see y'all
at the spades night, man.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.312
- All right.
- Come on, get yo'...

03:50.397 --> 03:51.564
<i>Excuse me.</i>

03:51.564 --> 03:53.274
Uh, sorry to bother you, everyone,

03:53.274 --> 03:55.110
but does anyone happen
to be the owner

03:55.110 --> 03:57.153
of that silver Prius
that's parked in the back?

03:57.153 --> 03:58.738
Oh, yeah, that's my car.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.616
Oh, well, um, parking in back
is for employees only.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.868
- Oh, my bad.
- No worries. Thank you.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.875
[huffs]

04:10.875 --> 04:11.918
[cheerily] Hi!

04:11.918 --> 04:12.919
Hey. What's up?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.546
I'm sorry
to bother you again,

04:14.546 --> 04:15.755
uh, but I actually need
the spot.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.132
That's why
I made the announcement.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.091
Could you move your car, please?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.467
Oh, yeah, for sure.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.969
Thank you.
[chuckles]

04:24.597 --> 04:27.100
- Sorry again...
- Oh, it's okay.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.852
Could you move your car now?

04:28.852 --> 04:30.353
Uh, one of our vendors
is on the way.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.938
- I won't be much longer.
- Okay.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.733
- Um, how much longer?
- I don't know.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.901
I mean, are you keeping a clock
on all your customers?

04:36.901 --> 04:38.987
What is going on? Look,
I'm trying to be reasonable.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.739
I mean, I could've
had your car towed.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.699
Oh, so we making threats now?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.617
No, I'm just saying
I could've had it towed.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.494
- Look, Mr. Donuts--
- Okay.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.246
The shop is called
Copy and Donuts,

04:48.246 --> 04:50.373
but my last name isn't Donuts,
and I feel like you know that.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.791
I don't know your life,
but you clearly

04:51.791 --> 04:53.335
don't want my business,
so next time,

04:53.335 --> 04:55.503
I'll be sure
to go somewhere else.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.548
What is happening?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.136
Nicky.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.929
Hey. You're early.

05:04.929 --> 05:09.142
Well, being late is very
uncharacteristic for me.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.894
I love being on time.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.354
In high school,
I was voted most likely

05:12.354 --> 05:14.689
to be on time for...

05:14.689 --> 05:15.940
stuff.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.901
Damn, that is so sexy.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.235
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.237
Who knew?
[laughs]

05:21.237 --> 05:23.948
[muttering] Oh, damn, Nicky,
you are so punctual.

05:23.948 --> 05:27.035
Mm. That's what's up.
[moans]

05:27.035 --> 05:28.411
[whispering] Yes!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.205
Hm?
What'd you say, baby?

05:30.205 --> 05:31.539
Oh, nothing.
You're cute.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.957
Go back to sleep.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.338
Why are you so deep
in your phone, Noah?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.215
- What's going on?
- Ugh.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.716
I got into it
with this woman at work,

05:41.716 --> 05:43.593
and now she just gave
Copy and Donuts

05:43.593 --> 05:45.011
- a one-star review.
- One star?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.429
Noah, what did you do?

05:46.429 --> 05:48.139
Nothing.
I just kindly asked her

05:48.139 --> 05:50.058
to move her car out
of an employees only spot,

05:50.058 --> 05:52.394
and now she's saying,
"Copy and Donuts offers

05:52.394 --> 05:54.062
"cold coffee
and struggle donuts,

05:54.062 --> 05:55.855
and the parking arrangement
is classist."

05:55.855 --> 05:57.357
Employee parking isn't
classist!

05:57.357 --> 05:58.608
Sounds classist to me.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.901
Whose side are you on?

05:59.901 --> 06:02.404
I'm always on the side
of drama in this dancery.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.947
I have to do something
about this.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.740
I--I just don't like
this bad review.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.117
I would strongly advise
against it.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.618
Can't please 'em all.
Just move on.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.453
Have you met me?
I can't just move on.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.913
I need to be liked, all right?

06:11.913 --> 06:13.748
So I'm gonna invite her
back to the shop

06:13.748 --> 06:14.749
and make things right.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.251
I just need to turn on some

06:16.251 --> 06:17.752
of ze, ah, business charm.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.879
- Ew, what is that?
- That was a French accent.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.256
What's up?
[clears throat]

06:21.256 --> 06:23.091
What's good, y'all?

06:23.091 --> 06:24.467
Sorry, excuse me.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.721
What? Is it the hat again?

06:27.721 --> 06:28.930
- both: Yes.
- Obviously.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.473
- Come on.
- Well, I think it looks good.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.808
Tell us what's happened
with this hat.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.351
- What's going on?
- This is ridiculous.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.936
Okay! Okay! Okay!

06:34.936 --> 06:37.564
Damn.
There was an incident

06:37.564 --> 06:38.940
at the barber shop.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.067
[laughter]

06:41.067 --> 06:42.235
And then I said,

06:42.235 --> 06:44.404
"Bust it down
and put that thang on it!"

06:44.404 --> 06:46.031
[laughter]

06:46.031 --> 06:48.366
[clipper buzzing]

06:48.366 --> 06:49.868
all: Damn!

06:49.868 --> 06:51.911
Ooh, he gon' need some hats.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.204
- Just show it to us.
- Mm.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.956
It can't be any worse
than it looks right now.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.624
Yeah, you look like
a sad fisherman.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.460
Over there
looking like LL Fool J.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.919
Ooh!
[laughter]

06:59.919 --> 07:02.505
Come on. It's your turn.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.092
- Man, look at that hat...
- Yes.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.385
Sitting on top
of your head...

07:07.385 --> 07:08.636
Yes.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.637
Looking like a...

07:09.637 --> 07:10.764
Come on, finish strong.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.807
- Sad fisherman.
- Ah, damn!

07:12.807 --> 07:13.892
Is that the best you got?

07:13.892 --> 07:16.019
- LL Fool J.
- I said that!

07:16.019 --> 07:18.271
Dude, somebody has gotta
teach you how to roast.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.981
Oh, I can roast. Huh.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.232
I'll roast you

07:21.232 --> 07:22.817
- like a pot roast.
- What?

07:22.817 --> 07:23.902
- Why?
- I will throw my drink

07:23.902 --> 07:25.487
in your face
if you do that again.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.988
- I'm dead.
- It's...

07:27.572 --> 07:29.324
So I asked you to come by

07:29.324 --> 07:31.159
because I was thinking about
our interaction the other day.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.162
And, you know,
I saw that one-star review,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.455
and I was just hoping
that we can, you know,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.957
- move past all this.
- Huh. Move past this how?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.543
I am so happy
you asked that, Mia,

07:40.543 --> 07:43.546
because I got you
free coffee...

07:43.546 --> 07:45.173
- Ah.
- Complimentary donuts.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.384
And if you need anything
printed today, it's on us.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.637
Wow, that is so very nice
of you, Mr. Donuts.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.263
You know, I was actually
on my way to FedEx

07:52.263 --> 07:54.641
to get some copies made,
but I'll do them here.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.142
- It's free.
- Great.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.060
Let me check it out.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.563
Let's see what we got here.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.232
Okay.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.858
What is this?

08:03.858 --> 08:06.319
Oh, they're horror movie
stills for a collage.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.862
Oh.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.739
Oh, right.
Yeah, that's right.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.949
[stammering]
That's what they are, yeah.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.158
Horror.
[chuckles]

08:12.158 --> 08:14.285
That's um--
that's my favorite genre.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.537
So you must be a real fan too.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.871
That's so cool.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.415
Anyway,
I'll get these started for you.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.292
And, uh, I'm just really happy
we could make this work.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.169
It's so nice
when people take full ownership

08:23.169 --> 08:24.587
of their mistakes.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.631
[weakly] For sho'.
Yeah, for sho'.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.260
- What's this?
- Oh, it's a surprise.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.178
You're not supposed
to see those yet.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.681
Is this a list of roasts
for spades night?

08:34.681 --> 08:37.225
Yes. Is it against the rules
to prepare roasts in advance?

08:37.225 --> 08:38.727
They do it all the time
on Comedy Central.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.311
Preparation ain't my issue.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.730
It's these roasts.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.357
"Hey, Dale,
your shirt is so white"?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.818
Yeah, and then you guys say,
"How white is it?"

08:46.818 --> 08:48.778
- It's in the script.
- We not reading a script!

08:48.778 --> 08:50.196
And what if he's not
wearing a white shirt?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.740
This is a terrible plan!

08:51.740 --> 08:54.325
Oh, man,
you are horrible at roasting.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.452
But I can show you the way.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.786
- Really? You'd do that for me?
- Yes.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.288
I am tired
of watching you get tore up.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.415
- Come on, let's get to work.
- Okay.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.208
Age.
Boy, you so old

09:02.208 --> 09:03.752
- with your old, ancient ass...
- Old ass...

09:03.752 --> 09:04.794
- You ran track with Moses.
- Moses.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.004
Hand out straight. Boy!

09:06.004 --> 09:07.213
- Boy.
- Say that. Boy!

09:07.213 --> 09:09.132
- Boy.
- No, don't actually hit me.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.301
- both: Hair.
- Boy, you so damn bald--

09:11.301 --> 09:13.136
you can still say it,
even though you bald.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.346
Trust me, I'm bald too. That's
why I wear all these hats.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.556
You ain't got no hair
'cause you bald!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.433
No, that's--
that's too obvious, man!

09:18.433 --> 09:19.601
Run down my whole outfit.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.394
Man, look at that jacket,

09:21.394 --> 09:23.104
wearing it on your back.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.774
It looks like someone said,
"Picasso!"

09:25.774 --> 09:27.942
- Splash, with the paint.
- [sighs]

09:27.942 --> 09:30.153
None of my feelings are hurt.
I feel fine.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.113
both: Boy look at yo' shoes!
Boy, look at yo' knees!

09:32.113 --> 09:33.990
Boy, look at yo' stomach!
Boy, look at yo' shoulders!

09:33.990 --> 09:35.784
- Boy, look at yo' head!
- Okay, you're getting it.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.118
Boy, look at yo' shoes.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.120
They look like knockoff
Payless sneakers.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.122
both: Boy, look at yo' knees!
Boy, look at yo' stomach!

09:41.122 --> 09:42.957
Boy, look at yo' shoulders!
Boy, look at yo' head!

09:42.957 --> 09:44.209
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [laughs]

09:44.209 --> 09:46.044
Okay, you're getting it.
You're getting it.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.466
Okay.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.884
Clarke got you flowers,

09:52.884 --> 09:54.803
so things must be really
working out with him?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.137
They definitely are.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.348
His sleep-talking
is a cheat code.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.600
For the first time,
I know exactly

10:00.600 --> 10:02.018
what the person
I'm dating wants,

10:02.018 --> 10:03.812
and he loves me for it.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.438
[singsongy]
Breakfast in bed.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.107
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.526
- I love breakfast in bed.
- Yep.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.777
And guess what?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.029
Two tickets
to the Magic Castle.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.281
No way. I love magic.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.199
How did you know?

10:16.199 --> 10:17.575
Well done.
You've turned

10:17.575 --> 10:19.661
his sleep condition
into a perfect relationship.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.037
Kind of.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.581
I mean, he's obviously
obsessed with me,

10:23.581 --> 10:25.166
which is every girl's dream.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.669
But he's not nearly
as perfect as I am.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.004
What do you mean?

10:29.004 --> 10:30.964
Well, for example,
these flowers,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.298
I don't like them.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.383
I like lilies.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.843
Too bad you don't talk
in your sleep,

10:34.843 --> 10:36.219
or he'd already know that.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.474
Anthony, you are brilliant.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.228
I have to talk in my sleep
so I get exactly what I want.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.272
I was making
an offhanded joke.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.940
I wasn't suggesting that
at all.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.859
Too late.
I'm already going to do it.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.445
- I must go to bed!
- Good luck with that.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.363
And see, we had
a whole conversation,

10:55.363 --> 10:56.656
and you didn't even
notice my hat.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.866
Check the text thread.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.826
[cell phone chimes and buzzes]

11:01.411 --> 11:02.746
Wait.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.334
<i>[laughter]</i>

11:07.334 --> 11:09.711
Look, aye, Dale and I haven't
lost in weeks.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.879
- Mm-hmm
- So I hope you're not

11:10.879 --> 11:12.881
a sore loser, Sherm.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.215
Man, the only thing sore
about me

11:14.215 --> 11:16.718
is my eyes
from looking at yo' ugly ass.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.595
Oh!
[laughter]

11:18.595 --> 11:20.764
Hey, look at Wyatt.
Only thing weaker than his hand

11:20.764 --> 11:22.807
is his hairline.
[laughter]

11:22.807 --> 11:26.019
The only thing weak in here
is that baby chest of yours.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.228
You look like a Slim Jim,

11:27.228 --> 11:29.022
but you need to snap
into a gym-gym.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.316
- Oh!
- Okay!

11:31.316 --> 11:32.734
Okay. A'ight.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.486
Wyatt brought his teeth today!
Damn!

11:34.486 --> 11:36.529
And I see you still
haven't brushed yours.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.281
I can smell that breath
from way over here.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.407
Smell like booty.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.744
- Oh!
- You Milk Dud head-ass boy.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.537
And this is my house!

11:44.537 --> 11:45.538
- Boom!
- Oh.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.457
Aah!

11:52.212 --> 11:53.213
I just wanted to say
thank you so much

11:54.422 --> 11:55.465
for changing your review
on Yelp to five stars.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.841
And we are very happy
to provide you

11:56.841 --> 11:58.259
with more violent imagery.
[chuckles]

11:58.259 --> 12:00.178
- Thanks, Mr. Donuts.
- [softly] That's not my name.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.222
You know, I'm doing a blood
and guts booth at Murder-Con.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.973
It's the largest
horror convention

12:03.973 --> 12:05.058
in San Gabriel Valley.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.142
You had me at blood,

12:06.142 --> 12:07.811
but then you went
and added the guts.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.104
I love that. Chef's kiss.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.147
All right,
so your total is $88.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.066
[laughs]
You're funny.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.567
What's funny?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.777
You know what? Yeah.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.362
88 is a goofy, little number.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.322
All round and no edges.
[laughs]

12:19.322 --> 12:20.657
So, uh, how do you wanna pay?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.325
I'm not paying.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.827
You said everything was free.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.036
Well, that was
a one-time deal.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.496
I wouldn't offer you a lifetime

12:26.496 --> 12:28.707
of free copies, coffee,
and donuts, you know?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.835
And I wouldn't spend $88
of my own money here.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.169
Are you really rescinding
your offer?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.672
I never made that offer.
You misunderstood.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.007
So you're saying I'm stupid?

12:37.007 --> 12:39.009
No, I'm saying
your interpretation

12:39.009 --> 12:40.927
of this situation
is very silly.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.303
Wow, so you really
gonna make me

12:42.303 --> 12:44.055
go back into Yelp
and change my review?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.015
I'm sorry,
are you really trying

12:45.015 --> 12:46.433
to blackmail me right now?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.059
I bet you don't
even like horror.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.644
Of course I don't like
horror movies.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.813
Why would anyone intentionally
tap into the emotion of fear?

12:51.813 --> 12:53.690
- You're just too weak.
- And you're just too wack.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.233
[gasps]

12:55.233 --> 12:56.484
[groans]

12:56.484 --> 12:57.902
What are you doing?

13:01.031 --> 13:03.199
This Mia chick
is ruining my life.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.368
We told you to stay away,
but you didn't listen

13:05.368 --> 13:07.037
even though you got
them big-ass ears.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.038
- [laughter]
- Whoa!

13:08.038 --> 13:09.080
Ooh, that's new.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.123
He caught the bug.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.166
He's a roastmaster now.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.001
Aye, aye, aye,
roast these nuts.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.919
[laughter]

13:14.919 --> 13:16.546
I'm sorry.
It's just so much fun.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.923
I can't believe no one told me
how good this feels.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.343
I'm really happy for you,
Wyatt, but this is serious.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.053
Mia's bombing our Yelp page

13:23.053 --> 13:24.554
with all these fake
negative reviews.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.765
It dropped our overall rating
from 4.8 stars

13:26.765 --> 13:28.141
down to 2.5 stars.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.559
This is bad for business.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.644
No one goes to places
with 2.5 stars.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.896
That's not true.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.773
I went to a vegan restaurant
with 2.5 stars.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.149
- And how was it?
- Really great,

13:36.149 --> 13:37.817
until I was hospitalized
with food poisoning.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.986
I'll never go back there.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.905
Ah, I see
what you're saying now.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.990
So what are you gonna do next
to make her like you?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.408
No, we're past that.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.577
I'm not gonna get her
to like me.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.580
I'm gonna get even.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.040
[feigning snores]

13:52.040 --> 13:53.875
Fore... fore...

13:53.875 --> 13:55.418
foreplay.

13:55.418 --> 13:58.672
[trills] I need more foreplay.

13:58.672 --> 14:03.259
Speaking of plays,
take me to a play.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.387
Wear the blue shirt.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.305
Not the red one.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.683
You look like
Clifford the Big Red Dog.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.852
Hey, Keith, Dale. What's up?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.938
- Ah, what's up, y'all?
- Aye, The Two Stooges.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.358
Ha ha ha, and there's
K-Ci and JoJo's broke cousins.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.985
At least I'm not Wyatt
wearing a shmedium sweatshirt.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.279
Yeah, if you need
some new options,

14:23.279 --> 14:24.489
you can borrow
my son's clothes.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.324
Ah, okay, well, stop playing,

14:26.324 --> 14:28.326
'cause we all know
that Toby ain't your real son.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.911
- Oh, boy.
- And Dale,

14:29.911 --> 14:32.747
I heard that your wife cheated
on you with your chiropractor.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.499
I guess he's breaking
both y'all's backs.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.710
- Oh, my goodness! No!
- Hey, that's cold, bro.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.629
Shut yo' bitch ass up!

14:39.629 --> 14:42.465
The only thing cold
is your house,

14:42.465 --> 14:44.342
seeing as how you just
got laid off.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.636
- I guess you can't afford heat.
- No, you can afford heat.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.762
He can afford heat.
Man, you can afford heat.

14:47.762 --> 14:48.972
You look like you pay
for all the heat.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.140
Pay for my heat bill.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.476
Oh, hello, Anthony.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.563
Nicky, I see you got
the lilies you wanted.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.148
- Did you--
- Tell Clarke exactly

14:58.148 --> 14:59.315
what I wanted in his sleep?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.026
Yes, I call it
suggestive sleeping.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.652
Suggestive sleeping?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.487
I think it's the future
of dating.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.780
It is great.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.490
He got me the flowers
that I wanted.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.409
He no longer talks
with his mouth full.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.120
He's gonna take me to see "Six"
at the Pantages Theatre.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.873
Ooh, he is the perfect man now,

15:14.873 --> 15:16.416
all because of me.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.293
This all sounds
a little too good to be true.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.046
You might be flying
a little too close to the sun.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.464
And so are you in that hat.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.382
- Let me see that.
- No. No, no.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.303
Good afternoon.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.013
What can I get you today?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.056
Revenge.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.349
- You.
- Hey, Mia.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.725
What do you want?

15:33.725 --> 15:34.851
Just a cup of coffee.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.353
The place I work at serves 'em

15:36.353 --> 15:39.272
a little bit too... cold.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.067
That is not why you're here,
you son of a bitch!

15:42.067 --> 15:44.736
Me? A son of one bitch?

15:44.736 --> 15:46.404
Oh, my.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.365
You can't talk
to your customers like that.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.784
May I speak to your manager?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.038
I got her ass fired!

15:55.038 --> 15:56.414
Victory! Ha ha!

16:00.669 --> 16:01.211
You got her fired?

16:02.587 --> 16:03.880
Don't you think that's taking
things a little too far?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.465
She came for my workspace,
so I came for hers.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.258
Yeah, but you still
have a job though.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.927
- And now, she doesn't.
- I know.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.470
It's amazing. I won.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.888
This is not like you.

16:11.888 --> 16:12.972
What happened to my brother

16:12.972 --> 16:14.766
who loves love
and loves being loved?

16:14.766 --> 16:17.143
Well, he's on break.
You need me to take a message?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.353
Yeah, don't listen to them.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.021
I'm proud of you, Noah.
Scorched-earth.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.523
See? Wyatt gets it.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.566
Wyatt has lost his mind too.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.110
Both of y'all are
spinning out of control.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.444
Man, shut the hell up.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.862
Ain't nobody trying
to hear you talk.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.280
- Oh-hoh-hoh.
- You gonna take that?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.032
Sherm's my son.
Of course he gonna take that.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.534
all: Ooh!

16:33.326 --> 16:34.619
<i>- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.</i>

16:34.619 --> 16:36.621
So what's going on?
It sounded serious.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.123
Oh!

16:38.123 --> 16:40.125
Keith and Dale.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.794
I didn't realize
it was bitch-ass o'clock.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.713
Have a seat, Wyatt.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.880
Okay.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.009
So what's going on?
What is this about?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.343
Dale, would you like
to start?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.512
Yeah.
Well, here's the thing, Wyatt.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.098
At first, you weren't
really a good roaster.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.683
Now, you're just
not a good person.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.393
- Huh.
- You've taken it too far.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.145
And it hurts, man.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.480
It's my fault.
I unlocked this monster.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.232
And I shouldn't have
because this ain't you.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.817
Oh, yes, it is.
I'm a roaster now.

17:05.817 --> 17:09.279
And you are all just a bunch
of pathetic losers.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.947
You don't even mean
the words you're saying.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.157
Oh, yes, I do.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.199
Y'all just can't take the heat

17:13.199 --> 17:14.492
'cause y'all a bunch of chumps.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.910
- No, we're not.
- Yes, you are.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.787
- You're better than this.
- You have bad credit.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.331
I've got great credit!
Th--that's a lie!

17:20.331 --> 17:21.833
This can't feel good anymore.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.293
Oh, yes, it does.

17:23.293 --> 17:24.377
No, it doesn't.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.962
- Come on.
- [chuckles weakly]

17:28.923 --> 17:30.216
Yeah.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.676
[sobbing]
No, it doesn't.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.303
I took it too far.
I'm sorry, y'all.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.554
That's a'ight.
We here for you.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.222
- We your boys. We your boys.
- It's okay, man.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.270
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:42.270 --> 17:44.189
- What are you doing?
- You got me fired.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.482
You didn't think I'd respond?

17:45.482 --> 17:46.900
This isn't the same.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.360
You tanked our Yelp rating,

17:48.360 --> 17:50.070
and I complained
to your manager.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.488
This is vandalism.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.032
Dude, why are you taking
my criticism about you

17:54.032 --> 17:56.493
and your bad management
as an attack on you?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.828
Because it literally is.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.288
You said, and I quote,

18:00.288 --> 18:01.873
"The worst thing
about Copy and Donuts

18:01.873 --> 18:03.208
is Mr. Donuts himself."

18:03.208 --> 18:05.669
That wasn't me
that said that.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.337
Okay, it was me that said that.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.923
But where's the lie?

18:09.923 --> 18:11.633
Look.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.011
I'm not a bad person, okay?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.429
[sighs]

18:16.429 --> 18:18.306
But you could be
a better manager.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.891
Say what?

18:19.891 --> 18:23.186
You could be a better manager
with a few improvements.

18:23.186 --> 18:26.564
Like, if some of the parking
in the back was for customers,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.566
- you'd get way more business.
- Whatever.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.360
And you should
replace the donuts

18:30.360 --> 18:31.486
in the middle of the day.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.238
This place would be
way more popular

18:33.238 --> 18:34.280
with fresher donuts.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.074
[scoffs]

18:36.074 --> 18:37.033
[sighs]

18:38.410 --> 18:39.911
O--okay, fine.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.996
Do you want a job then?

18:41.996 --> 18:43.248
- What?
- Those were all

18:43.248 --> 18:45.792
really good suggestions, okay?

18:45.792 --> 18:50.296
I mean, you're unemployed,
and we need the help.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.424
So do you want the job or what?

18:53.425 --> 18:55.260
So you hired her?

18:55.260 --> 18:56.970
Ooh, the drama continues.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.180
I mean, she was right
about the business.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.433
Also, I was worried that
if I didn't offer her the job,

19:01.433 --> 19:02.809
she would spray-paint
the whole store up.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.645
So she basically blackmailed
herself into a job?

19:05.645 --> 19:08.440
I kind of respect her
for that, you know?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.316
- Mm-hmm.
- What's up, y'all?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.609
- Ugh.
- Enough is enough.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.028
- Let me see that scalp.
- No!

19:13.028 --> 19:15.113
- Ooh, get him! Get him!
- No! Please stop!

19:15.113 --> 19:16.698
- Agh!
- Gosh!

19:33.465 --> 19:35.842
like a baby.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.011

19:38.011 --> 19:41.306

in Palm Springs.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.141
Mm. Mm.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.768
Hey. Are you fake sleeping?

19:44.768 --> 19:46.519
You clearly just
responded to me,

19:46.519 --> 19:49.397
so wake up or--
or open your eyes or whatever.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.399
Okay, okay, okay.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.901
Look, you were talking
in your sleep,

19:52.901 --> 19:54.527
and--and it proved
to be very insightful,

19:54.527 --> 19:55.987
so I--I figured
I'd give it a try too.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.907
Okay, honestly, I didn't
start talking in my sleep

19:58.907 --> 20:00.492
until you were talking
in your sleep.

20:00.492 --> 20:01.951
- I did?
- Yeah.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.370
I didn't know that.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.288
Well, that--that was my first
time ever fake sleeping.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.998
Oh.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.334
Oh, so--so that's how
you knew all the stuff I liked.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.878
Yeah. I'm sorry.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.672
You know what?
It--it's okay.

20:13.672 --> 20:14.839
You know, maybe now
we can just start being

20:14.839 --> 20:17.050
open and honest
with each other, huh?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.177
Okay. I like that.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.012
This? This is good.

This is good.

You wanna spank me

20:32.816 --> 20:34.275
Yeah, that ain't gonna work.
Mm-mm.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.027
No, you gotta go.
You gotta get out.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.071
I'm so sorry. God bless.
