WEBVTT

00:02.819 --> 00:03.744
Hey, what can I get for you?

00:03.838 --> 00:05.671
Uh, what flavor slushies
you got?

00:05.822 --> 00:07.064
We like blue flavor.

00:07.233 --> 00:08.081
Well, blue is the best.

00:08.234 --> 00:09.491
I mean, blue teeth, blue tongue.

00:09.568 --> 00:11.176
It's not a flavor
found in nature-- just blue.

00:11.328 --> 00:13.012
Mm-mm, all y'all are crazy.

00:13.239 --> 00:15.239
The best flavor, red.

00:15.332 --> 00:16.256
Red gives me brain freeze.

00:16.392 --> 00:18.017
Red is so much colder than blue.

00:18.244 --> 00:19.910
Oh, dude, she gets us.

00:19.928 --> 00:22.579
Yeah, I get you!
I get young people things.

00:22.598 --> 00:24.081
I watch<i> Euphoria.</i>

00:24.174 --> 00:25.432
Although, most of the time,
I have to watch like this.

00:25.584 --> 00:26.600
Like, "Mm."

00:26.694 --> 00:29.177
Uh, so we'll take
two blue slushies, please.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.270
Throw in a red one.

00:30.439 --> 00:31.864
Brain freezes
really help me think.

00:32.015 --> 00:34.107
Unfortunately,
we don't sell slushies.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.760
So you'll talk about them
but you won't make them?

00:36.779 --> 00:38.186
-Huh.
-Slush tease.

00:38.355 --> 00:40.688
You two don't seem
like you're from around here.

00:40.783 --> 00:43.767
That's because they're from
Thursdays at 9:30 on Fox

00:43.769 --> 00:45.102
and streaming on Hulu.

00:45.271 --> 00:47.604
We won a scratch-off ticket,
so we decided

00:47.697 --> 00:49.439
to take the cash
and go on a pilgrimage.

00:49.533 --> 00:52.442
We're putting a ten-piece bucket
on Colonel Sanders' grave.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.553
Master of the chicken,
inventor of the spork--

00:54.780 --> 00:55.554
guy's a legend.

00:55.781 --> 00:56.797
(smacking)

00:56.891 --> 00:57.705
(grunts)

00:57.800 --> 00:59.040
Truly a visionary.

00:59.134 --> 01:00.542
I wish more things were served
in a bucket.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.619
-Mm.
-Oh, my God!
Billion-dollar idea!

01:02.638 --> 01:03.620
Slushie in a bucket!

01:03.639 --> 01:04.638
Slush bucket!

01:05.399 --> 01:07.140
Don't even think
about stealing my idea.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.735
Yeah, we got to patent that
when we get back to Flatch.

01:09.886 --> 01:10.977
Wait, what's a flatch?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.053
Uh, the town we're from.

01:12.147 --> 01:13.572
We basically run the place.

01:13.723 --> 01:15.056
I'm Kelly Mallet, my honor.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.225
-And this is my coz, Shrub.
-(grunts)

01:17.319 --> 01:18.560
Maybe you've heard of me.

01:18.654 --> 01:19.653
I haven't.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.895
SHRUB:
Well, if you ever want

01:20.915 --> 01:22.656
to visit,
I can borrow Kelly's beanbag

01:22.750 --> 01:23.974
for all of your lounging needs.

01:24.067 --> 01:25.066
No, you can't.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.234
Are you kidding me right now?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.311
She's coming for the weekend.

01:27.329 --> 01:28.420
Wait, uh, that's not happening.

01:28.572 --> 01:29.496
Way to go, Kel.

01:29.648 --> 01:30.664
Okay, relax,
I'll buy you a slushie.

01:30.816 --> 01:32.240
Oh, (bleep) yeah.

01:32.334 --> 01:34.093
Did he just get a bleep?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.502
We don't get to do that here.

01:35.654 --> 01:38.246
Listen, we'll be
at the liquor store parking lot

01:38.324 --> 01:41.007
doing something sick
if you want to come through.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.175
-I don't.
-(chuckles)

01:42.252 --> 01:44.436
Okay. I will see you there.

01:44.663 --> 01:46.105
Billion-dollar idea--

01:46.332 --> 01:47.497
blue-flavored coffee.

01:47.516 --> 01:48.440
Red would be better.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.275
-And now you just ruined it.
-(laughs)

01:50.502 --> 01:51.668
Hey. Kitty Kat.

01:51.687 --> 01:52.686
Hello, Nick.

01:52.838 --> 01:53.946
Are you here as my landlord

01:54.097 --> 01:55.930
or just the annoying guy
from down the block?

01:55.950 --> 01:59.359
Or as the guy
she had pity sex with twice?

01:59.528 --> 02:00.360
Pity sex?

02:00.512 --> 02:02.195
That's the word on the street.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.081
Mm-hmm.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.516
Listen, can we talk in private?

02:06.535 --> 02:08.293
Uh, sorry.
Can't leave the counter.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.630
The, uh... 2:37 rush
is about to come in.

02:11.707 --> 02:13.132
Fine. Here's the deal.

02:13.283 --> 02:16.376
I asked around. What you're
paying in rent is under market.

02:16.528 --> 02:19.120
Yeah, well, I asked around
and no one likes you.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.549
Classic retort from the case
of<i> Rubber v. Glue.</i>

02:22.701 --> 02:24.868
"Bounce, me. Stick, you."

02:24.961 --> 02:26.645
Anyway, starting next month,

02:26.796 --> 02:28.647
café's rent goes up 40%.

02:28.798 --> 02:30.649
What? Is that even legal?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.985
-Scuse me.
-Yeah, my lawyer
looked through your lease.

02:33.136 --> 02:35.136
He said I could do whatever I
want. I was cutting you a break.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.822
40% is cutting me a break?

02:36.973 --> 02:38.548
I'm sorry,
could I just get a nonfat latte?

02:38.567 --> 02:40.033
Not right now!

02:41.387 --> 02:42.402
How can you even do this?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.737
Look, I'm sorry.
It's not personal--

02:43.813 --> 02:45.055
it's just business.

02:45.224 --> 02:46.314
So, on the first of the month,
you'll owe me...

02:46.333 --> 02:47.482
Yeah, I was a math professor.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.834
I can do 40% in my head.

02:48.985 --> 02:50.577
(muttering):
Carry the five.

02:50.654 --> 02:52.229
Um, do we...

02:52.247 --> 02:53.505
Well, while you're crunching
the numbers there,

02:53.732 --> 02:56.066
you can also tack on 40%
for your apartment.

02:56.084 --> 02:57.234
Seriously?

02:57.252 --> 02:58.752
Again, it's not personal.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.070
Yeah, well, neither is this.

03:00.163 --> 03:02.497
You are
an absolute (bleeping) head

03:02.516 --> 03:04.141
(bleep) wipe.

03:05.168 --> 03:07.744
Guess we do get to do that here.

03:08.505 --> 03:10.022
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

03:10.173 --> 03:12.524
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

03:13.602 --> 03:15.769
Hey, everyone,
I'm running some numbers.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.604
I'm trying to cut back on costs.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.589
How do y'all feel
about one-ply toilet paper?

03:19.608 --> 03:22.943
I will kindly ask that you
never speak of its existence

03:23.095 --> 03:25.186
in my presence again.

03:26.189 --> 03:28.114
Okay, well, add that
to the long list of things

03:28.209 --> 03:29.599
that Phil doesn't like,

03:29.618 --> 03:30.709
along with<i> Spider-Man,</i>
the musical,

03:30.860 --> 03:33.119
and pants
that unzip into shorts.

03:33.272 --> 03:34.362
You don't like zip-away pants?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.714
You're ready for everything.

03:35.865 --> 03:37.216
"Nice to meet you,
Mr. President.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.367
"Oh, would I like
to play basketball?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.385
"Yes! Of course!

03:40.537 --> 03:41.611
I'm already ready."

03:41.630 --> 03:43.447
Zip. Zip.

03:44.132 --> 03:46.892
How 'bout this?
Phil, could you make muffins

03:47.043 --> 03:49.286
with frozen blueberries
instead of fresh?

03:49.379 --> 03:52.356
Could you take your mouth
and shut it?

03:53.717 --> 03:55.308
Carter, can I talk to you
outside for a minute?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.235
Sure.

03:57.296 --> 03:59.571
Okay, so you know
that Nick bought my building,

03:59.798 --> 04:00.814
-raised my rent.
-Yeah.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.149
That guy's name
should be Dick Move.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.150
(chuckles):
Yeah.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.911
So what you gonna do?

04:06.062 --> 04:08.497
(sighs) Well,
I was hoping you could help me.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.065
Oh. I got you.

04:11.159 --> 04:12.233
I know a guy.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.252
No, that-that's
not what I meant.

04:13.328 --> 04:14.644
Yeah, of course it's not.

04:14.663 --> 04:15.996
No, I don't want you
threatening Nick

04:16.090 --> 04:17.481
-or anything like that.
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

04:17.574 --> 04:18.757
We good.

04:19.501 --> 04:21.318
No, no, no. That-That's
really not what I want.

04:21.411 --> 04:22.761
And that's exactly what
you should say

04:22.988 --> 04:24.263
if there's any questions.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.298
Can you stop texting whoever
you're texting? I just want

04:26.450 --> 04:28.492
to know what you would do
in my situation.

04:28.585 --> 04:30.418
Oh. Got you.

04:30.512 --> 04:32.437
Hey, I-I'll clear things up
with Freddie later.

04:32.589 --> 04:35.089
Don't worry.
He's kind of a procrastinator.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.350
Look, I'm-I'm trying
to reduce costs,

04:37.503 --> 04:40.094
I'm raising prices,
but it's just not enough.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.521
Maybe I should cancel
my health insurance.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.690
I'll be okay.
I come from hearty stock.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.175
Mm. Didn't your dad die young?

04:45.193 --> 04:46.809
Yeah, but I'm hoping
I get my mom's genes.

04:46.811 --> 04:48.787
She'll outlive us all.
When the machines take over,

04:49.014 --> 04:50.514
she'll be the last human alive,

04:50.532 --> 04:52.866
asking some robot
to help her with her email.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.460
Look, my biggest expense
is staff.

04:55.612 --> 04:56.853
And bathroom repairs.

04:56.946 --> 04:58.188
I mean, I don't know
what you women do in there,

04:58.206 --> 04:59.965
but y'all can wreck a bathroom.

05:00.192 --> 05:01.633
I can't cut back on staff.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.468
I've only got Phil and Randi.

05:03.695 --> 05:05.211
And they both serve
critical roles

05:05.306 --> 05:08.140
in the functioning
of this business.

05:13.872 --> 05:14.888
-That's a wellness activity.
-Mm-hmm.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.481
And it's really good
for staff morale.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.375
This is where it gets tough
to be the boss.

05:18.393 --> 05:20.210
You got to make
the hard decisions.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.653
And since Randi's my boo,

05:21.730 --> 05:23.304
the hard decision is Phil.

05:23.398 --> 05:24.881
No, that's not happening.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.140
I'll think of something else.

05:26.234 --> 05:27.734
-(phone chimes)
-(sighs)

05:27.828 --> 05:28.810
Uh-oh.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.070
Freddie and his boys
are rolling.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.496
I got to go.

05:35.894 --> 05:39.412
Come on. There's got to be
some superpower you'd want.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.155
Invisibility?

05:41.175 --> 05:44.417
Oh, please. Why would I want to
deprive people of all of this?

05:44.570 --> 05:45.660
(chuckles)

05:45.754 --> 05:46.903
What about you?

05:47.664 --> 05:50.574
I would like the ability
to make waffles in an instant.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.593
(laughs) So, wait, so, wait,
you'd be Waffle Man?

05:53.687 --> 05:54.853
Okay. So hear me out.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.388
Frozen ones
are a disappointment,

05:56.615 --> 05:58.598
and-and waffles from scratch
take too long.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.085
So if I could have
the perfect waffle anytime,

06:02.104 --> 06:03.362
whenever I wanted it,

06:03.589 --> 06:05.697
I think my life
would be complete.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.516
-I can get behind that.
-(chuckles)

06:08.610 --> 06:12.019
Drunk late-night partygoers,
have no fear.

06:12.114 --> 06:14.021
Waffle Man is here!

06:14.116 --> 06:16.023
He took that from me,

06:16.043 --> 06:17.667
Pancake Girl!

06:18.604 --> 06:19.878
You're both so cute.

06:20.029 --> 06:20.995
And so white.

06:21.106 --> 06:22.606
-Mwah.
-Mwah.

06:22.624 --> 06:23.773
So, how was your day?

06:23.867 --> 06:25.032
Big news. I'm playing piano

06:25.085 --> 06:26.868
for this fundraising event
on Saturday.

06:26.962 --> 06:28.870
Guess who's headlining.
Robin Thicke.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.038
(gasps)
Robin Thicke. He's awesome.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.782
And he has the best hair
I've ever seen.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.393
(gasps)
Excuse me?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.136
I said what I said.

06:37.289 --> 06:38.730
But how cool would it be
if you got to meet him

06:38.882 --> 06:40.123
and play him one of your songs?

06:40.142 --> 06:41.233
Ooh, and I just wrote a new one

06:41.460 --> 06:42.792
about growing up without a dad.

06:42.794 --> 06:44.385
Sounds like a real banger.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.479
Do you think
you could get me in?

06:46.632 --> 06:48.815
My badge says
"musician number three."

06:48.909 --> 06:50.150
What do you think?

06:50.393 --> 06:52.469
Okay, well, then I guess
I'll just have to sneak in.

06:52.562 --> 06:54.913
Please, you're a heavy-footed,
loud-talking fool.

06:55.064 --> 06:56.081
He is.

06:56.232 --> 06:58.475
-He's handsome Frankenstein.
-(chuckling)

06:58.568 --> 06:59.976
Well, then this is a job

06:59.995 --> 07:01.144
-for...
-No.
-Stop.

07:01.163 --> 07:02.570
...Waffle Man!

07:02.664 --> 07:07.092
I will just have
to sneak in syrup-titiously.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.820
Aw, where's Kat
when you need her?

07:11.506 --> 07:14.933
Hey, team. Y'all remember my
young friends Kelly and Shrub.

07:15.160 --> 07:15.934
We slushed it up.

07:16.161 --> 07:17.010
Brain freeze!

07:17.162 --> 07:18.770
-Aw! Lucky!
-Aah!

07:18.922 --> 07:20.163
What is happening?

07:20.256 --> 07:22.089
What's happening is
they didn't bring us slushies.

07:22.184 --> 07:23.442
That's what's happening.

07:23.669 --> 07:25.168
Sup, girl?

07:25.261 --> 07:26.853
"Sup" is not a word.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.339
I'm a grown-ass woman. And nope.

07:29.357 --> 07:30.356
Third time today. Roasted.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.691
Hey. Shooters got to shoot.

07:31.843 --> 07:33.100
You know how it is.

07:33.345 --> 07:35.770
-(chuckles) Hells to the yeah,
I know how it is.
-Uh-huh.

07:35.939 --> 07:38.582
It's arduous out there
for a player, am I right?

07:40.702 --> 07:41.868
Why don't y'all go upstairs?

07:42.020 --> 07:43.128
I'll be right up
to show you around.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.204
Uh, do you have a microwave?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.446
-Yeah.
-KELLY: Sweet!

07:45.540 --> 07:46.465
Pizza pockets all day!

07:46.616 --> 07:49.134
-All day!
-All day!

07:49.285 --> 07:50.802
Wait, you didn't adopt them,
did you?

07:50.954 --> 07:53.472
No, they're just renting
my place while they're in town.

07:53.623 --> 07:56.700
And where'd you get that,
the Bad Idea Hall of Fame?

07:56.793 --> 07:58.551
It's all part of the plan.

07:58.704 --> 08:01.313
Renting out my apartment,
tutoring some kids in math.

08:01.464 --> 08:03.039
Make a little extra cash,
the ole Ben Franklins.

08:03.132 --> 08:06.710
By the way, can we get<i> that</i> guy
his own musical?

08:06.728 --> 08:08.545
Where are you gonna stay?

08:08.563 --> 08:10.137
Don't worry.
I've got it all figured out.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.715
(rapid, loud footfalls)

08:11.733 --> 08:13.733
Um, sweet jams.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.387
Uh, do you have any
without cats?

08:17.405 --> 08:20.147
Same question but for underwear.

08:20.909 --> 08:23.502
You know she's gonna put
your drawers on, right?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.509
Thank you for letting me stay
with you, Mother.

08:30.660 --> 08:33.178
Of course, sweetheart.
You're always welcome.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.830
It's not permanent, right?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.091
We both know,
if that were the case,

08:38.243 --> 08:39.351
we'd end up on<i> Dateline.</i>

08:39.578 --> 08:40.519
It's just temporary

08:40.595 --> 08:42.929
till I can get my life
back together.

08:43.081 --> 08:44.672
Oh, dear God. Mm.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.933
Uh, well, just sign here.

08:47.085 --> 08:47.842
What is this?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.602
It's a standard agreement.

08:49.755 --> 08:52.522
It protects you as much
as it protects me, dear.

08:53.349 --> 08:55.608
"Mother's bedroom is off-limits.

08:55.761 --> 08:58.370
-"Tenants are on their own

-Mm-hmm.

08:58.597 --> 09:00.764
$20-a-day resort fee"?

09:00.932 --> 09:02.023
Well, it includes Internet

09:02.042 --> 09:04.501
and access
to the fitness center.

09:06.863 --> 09:09.030
-You sure you don't want
a security deposit as well?
-No.

09:09.124 --> 09:11.441
I know you're tight on cash
right now.

09:11.534 --> 09:14.427
I'll just take any damages out
of my will.

09:17.966 --> 09:20.225
-Hi there.
-Oh! Not again.

09:21.044 --> 09:22.619
Well, you're...

09:22.621 --> 09:24.563
better-looking
than most of my male groupies,

09:24.714 --> 09:25.880
I'll give you that much.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.899
Oh. (chuckles)
I'm not a groupie.

09:28.051 --> 09:29.793
I-- Not that you aren't
very attractive.

09:29.886 --> 09:32.645
Uh, because you are. Even-even
better in person, by the way.

09:32.798 --> 09:34.130
Those eyes-- wow.

09:34.149 --> 09:35.481
Thank you. So what'll it be?

09:35.634 --> 09:37.075
You want the selfie,
the autograph

09:37.302 --> 09:38.484
or a strand of my hair?

09:38.653 --> 09:39.652
What?

09:39.779 --> 09:41.079
Well, you can't have all three,
brother.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.639
Unless you pay the 99 bucks

09:42.732 --> 09:45.733
-for the VIP Fan Club Package.
-Oh. (laughs)

09:45.752 --> 09:47.143
Right. Right.
(chuckles)

09:47.162 --> 09:48.812
I-I'm not here for any of that.

09:48.905 --> 09:50.922
Uh, uh, my name is Max Kingbird
and I'm a huge fan.

09:51.074 --> 09:53.650
And... whew,
I'm also a songwriter.

09:53.668 --> 09:55.485
And I'd like to play something
that I think

09:55.578 --> 09:56.820
would be perfect for you.

09:56.822 --> 09:58.579
And... (clears throat)
But... (clearing throat)

09:58.599 --> 10:00.673
First, do you think
I could grab some water?

10:00.826 --> 10:03.435
I'm a little nervous.
I get dry mouth. (grunts)

10:03.511 --> 10:05.995
Not a big sweater,
except for my feet.

10:06.014 --> 10:09.165
My shoes are like
hot tubs right now.

10:09.184 --> 10:10.834
That was dumb.

10:10.852 --> 10:12.927
This song's not about
any of this.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.929
Listen, man,
I'd love to hear it,

10:15.023 --> 10:16.356
but I got a show to do
in five minutes.

10:16.508 --> 10:18.617
Perfect.
My song's four and a half.

10:18.768 --> 10:22.512
Why don't you leave a demo,
and I'm gonna go get ready.

10:22.530 --> 10:23.346
-Okay.
-All right?

10:23.398 --> 10:25.031
-Sure. Yeah.
-Okay.

10:25.183 --> 10:27.626
-All right, thanks a lot,

-Here it is. It's right here.

Oh, wow, that's a lot
of diaries.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.417
Yeah. That's just
freshman year of college.

12:32.644 --> 12:34.735
Oh, freshman year of college.

12:34.829 --> 12:36.162
Is there anything about me

those journals.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.525
I'm not giving my dad
much to be proud of

13:22.618 --> 13:23.709
these days, am I?

13:23.804 --> 13:25.619
Stop.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.456
Sure, you fall, but you always
pick yourself back up.

13:29.534 --> 13:33.036
I know this because
you fall a lot.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.980
When I was little, they sent me

Listen, you gotta
cut yourself some slack.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.807
You're just going through
some stuff.

13:46.901 --> 13:48.976
You'll get out the other side.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.978

13:50.997 --> 13:54.648
Because you're Kat Silver,

how would you factor

14:12.501 --> 14:15.836
four-X squared plus four-X-Y
plus Y-squared?

14:16.005 --> 14:17.930
I wouldn't.

14:18.766 --> 14:20.375
All right, why don't we
put the phone down

14:20.377 --> 14:22.085
for a minute and focus
on your homework.

14:22.178 --> 14:24.103
'Cause I bet if
factoring polynomials

14:27.275 --> 14:29.442

14:29.594 --> 14:32.186
That's not really relevant
to algebra.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.763
So no.

14:33.781 --> 14:36.708
I'll have you know
I was engaged.

14:36.859 --> 14:38.042
It just didn't work out.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.379
Was it because you're a cat lady
or a math nerd?

14:41.606 --> 14:44.531
Okay, I think that's
enough for today.

14:44.626 --> 14:48.277
But my mom paid for an hour.
It's only been 52 minutes.

14:48.296 --> 14:49.888
Oh, now you care about math?

14:50.115 --> 14:52.765
You're right, I don't.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.709
And by the way, would a nerd

14:55.729 --> 14:57.970
be elected guest princess
at the jousting tournament

14:58.064 --> 15:00.899
at the Renaissance Faire?
Methinks not!

15:01.050 --> 15:05.236
If you think you won that,
methinks not.

15:06.722 --> 15:10.074
I do not envy you having
to deal with kids these days.

15:10.226 --> 15:12.076

the attention span of...

15:12.303 --> 15:15.062

15:15.898 --> 15:17.231
You know, I think
it's gonna be fine.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.585
I'm starting to feel like
I have a way out of this.

15:20.736 --> 15:22.420
You know? My tutoring clients
will bring in

15:22.571 --> 15:23.421
about 400 bucks a month.

15:23.572 --> 15:25.423
(loud creaking)

15:25.650 --> 15:26.407
What's that?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.817
It sounds like Mama's stomach

15:27.835 --> 15:30.386
the last 20 minutes of church.

15:31.339 --> 15:32.746
-(water splashing)
-What the...

15:32.840 --> 15:34.248
Uh-uh, I just got my hair done.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.433

-Go!

15:51.693 --> 15:53.284
SHRUB:
Go, go, go, go!

15:58.607 --> 16:01.275
Where am I gonna find the money
to pay for all this?

16:01.294 --> 16:05.946
I know, I know.
I have to fire Phil.

16:05.966 --> 16:09.300
If you need it, I've got
a few bucks tucked away.

16:09.452 --> 16:12.619
Dollywood will still
be spectacular next year.

16:12.714 --> 16:14.547
Oh, you're so sweet.

16:14.699 --> 16:16.140
Why is he so sweet?

16:16.367 --> 16:17.867
It's like firing Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny

16:17.885 --> 16:21.370
smushed together and squeezed
into boys size-12 pants.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.464
Phil, can we have a chat?

16:23.558 --> 16:25.817
Surely, girly.

16:26.894 --> 16:28.987
Um, we need to talk about
your job.

16:29.138 --> 16:33.432
Oh, it's not a job when you're
doing what you love.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.067
It's just that, um...

16:35.220 --> 16:37.996
Whew, gosh, how do I say this
without you hating me?

16:38.147 --> 16:39.980
I could never hate you.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.669
Besides, hate is just love
that needs a hug.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.562
Oh, you're so folksy.

16:46.655 --> 16:51.175
Well, I'm no folksier than a pig
wearing suspenders to church.

16:52.828 --> 16:54.737
Okay, I don't get that one.

16:54.756 --> 16:56.997
But, um, here's the thing.

16:57.091 --> 17:00.076
I can't afford two employees.

17:00.169 --> 17:02.854
And I think you know
where this is headed.

17:03.081 --> 17:07.025
I do. Poor Randi.

17:09.921 --> 17:14.157
Actually, Phil, I'm gonna
have to let you go.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.577
Oh.

17:19.764 --> 17:22.707
I'm so sorry. It's the last
thing I want to do.

17:22.934 --> 17:27.603
It is just so much cheaper
to buy pastries wholesale.

17:27.622 --> 17:28.880
Please don't be mad.

17:29.031 --> 17:32.032
Oh, I'm not mad.
I am furious!

17:32.126 --> 17:34.701
Oh, well, is furious just
happiness that needs a hug?

17:34.721 --> 17:38.539
I spend all day in that hot
sardine can of a kitchen!

17:38.558 --> 17:40.299
All right, this is good.
Just get it all out.

17:40.451 --> 17:43.061
Getting up at 4:00
in the blessed morning

17:43.137 --> 17:47.047
to listen to you yammer on
about Max this, Oscar that.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.292
"Oops, I slept with Nick!"

17:49.385 --> 17:50.884
Okay, that's getting
a little personal.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.461
And then this is
the thanks I get?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.630
Good luck keeping this place
afloat without me!

17:54.723 --> 17:57.633
I just have one thing
left to say.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.994
I hate cats!

18:08.922 --> 18:11.330
-I already miss Phil.
-Me, too.

18:11.482 --> 18:13.574
He used to challenge me
to tickle fights,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.075
and I always said no.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.577
Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.654
(phone vibrating)

18:18.673 --> 18:19.989
Hey, this is Max.

18:20.007 --> 18:22.675
No more gossiping about
customers with Phil.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.769
No more roasting your outfits.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.345
That was more you than him.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.331
Well, sometimes I gotta
give him one

18:28.424 --> 18:29.849
so I wouldn't come off too mean.

18:30.001 --> 18:31.592
Obviously, I keep the best ones
for myself.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.687
-Like this skirt...
-Yes, we all miss Phil.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.114
Y'all know
Phil's not dead, right?

18:36.265 --> 18:37.340
I mean, he's still our friend.

18:37.433 --> 18:40.176
-Even mine?
-Oh, hell no.

18:41.103 --> 18:42.787
I-I can't believe it.
This is amazing.

18:42.938 --> 18:44.789
Yeah. Great.
Okay, thanks again.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.533
That sounded like good news.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.851
No, it's no big deal.

18:48.870 --> 18:50.703
It's just the singer
I met the other night.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.964
-What singer?
-Robin Thicke.

18:53.115 --> 18:55.616
Oh, so he decided
not to press charges.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.859
That's a load off, huh?

18:57.879 --> 19:00.546
Robin Thicke? That's my favorite
judge on<i> Masked Singer.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
Super-hot Robin Thicke?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.291
Super-hot what now?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.051
Come on, baby, you know
he can pump up the tires,

19:06.204 --> 19:08.871
but you the only one
that get to ride the bike.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.039
(laughs)

19:10.041 --> 19:12.817
I played him my song
and he maybe...

19:12.968 --> 19:14.635
wants to record it.
I don't know, whatever.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.895
-Oh, my God!
-What?!

19:15.989 --> 19:17.396
Why would you
keep this a secret?

19:17.490 --> 19:18.805
I mean, you call me excited
when you open

19:18.825 --> 19:20.216
a shell with three peanuts.

19:20.385 --> 19:21.400
Well, I mean, first of all,

19:21.552 --> 19:22.809
that's awesome,
'cause, you know...

19:22.829 --> 19:24.887
-Bonus peanut, but...
-Bonus peanut.

19:24.906 --> 19:26.647
I feel weird
taking a victory lap

19:26.666 --> 19:28.557
when you're going through
such a hard time.

19:28.576 --> 19:30.817
No, you should never be afraid
to share with me,

19:30.837 --> 19:32.728
even if I'm having a hard time.

19:32.747 --> 19:33.913
We share everything.

19:34.065 --> 19:35.656
Like Robin Thicke's
phone number.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.134
Gimme, gimme, gimme...

19:39.420 --> 19:41.662
It's been ten minutes.
Can I get that coffee?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.556
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.479
Oops, I spilled it.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.767
Hey, Randi,
when you get a chance,

19:54.861 --> 19:56.101
one of the cats missed
the litter box

19:56.254 --> 19:59.422
and took a giant steaming Nick
on the floor.

19:59.515 --> 20:01.532
Okay, very adult.

20:01.759 --> 20:04.076
Oh, I'll just go get
the Nick scooper.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.597
-Hmm.
-What?

20:08.616 --> 20:10.449
This isn't very good.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.210
Are you kidding me?

20:12.361 --> 20:14.437
I'm just saying,
the old ones were better.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.714
Do you want to know why
the old ones were better, Nick?

20:16.941 --> 20:18.532
The old ones were made by Phil.

20:18.701 --> 20:20.534
Phil makes his with love.
These are made

20:20.703 --> 20:22.720
in some industrial kitchen
in Pittsburgh

20:22.871 --> 20:26.373
with an acceptable percentage of
bug parts, according to the FDA.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.466
Okay, settle down.

20:27.618 --> 20:29.285
Settle down? You want me
to settle down?

20:29.303 --> 20:32.621
I have a café to run.
I have cats to find homes for,

20:32.715 --> 20:36.141
smug tweens to teach math to
against their will.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.644
I mean, Nick,
you came into my life and you

20:38.796 --> 20:40.129
essentially ruined it!

20:40.298 --> 20:42.573
You raised my rent, I had
to fire one of my best friends!

20:42.800 --> 20:44.558
This, this is your fault!

20:44.652 --> 20:47.227
It is all your fault!
And I hate that--

20:47.396 --> 20:48.637
(wheezing)

20:48.731 --> 20:49.896
(gasps)
Kat?

20:50.065 --> 20:52.500
Help, I need help.

20:53.494 --> 20:54.669
This is not a bit.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.485
I don't want the cats to worry.

21:02.578 --> 21:04.745
Just tell them Mommy's gone
to live on a farm.

21:04.839 --> 21:06.322
Stop it, you're gonna be fine.

21:06.415 --> 21:07.673
-You don't know that.
-(stammers)

21:07.825 --> 21:08.933
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:09.010 --> 21:10.326
I'm bad in an emergency.

21:10.495 --> 21:13.062
It's better
you find that out now.

21:14.515 --> 21:16.524
All right, we'll meet you
at the hospital.

21:17.259 --> 21:20.002
Oh, sweet baby Jesus!

21:20.021 --> 21:21.595
Kat, I am so sorry!

21:21.614 --> 21:25.766
When I made that voodoo doll,
I did not expect it to work.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.435
Make one for Nick,
and we're even.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.288
I will.

21:30.439 --> 21:32.623
Well, hello.
