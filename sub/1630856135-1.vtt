00:44.625 --> 00:46.625
For the people!

00:55.416 --> 01:02.416
-For the people!
-For the people!

01:02.500 --> 01:09.416
-For the people!
-For the people!

01:17.208 --> 01:18.458
Let's go!

01:40.416 --> 01:43.875
Welcome to the Doi Boy Club.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.916
Hey, one martini, please.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.125
-Come here.
-Hey.

01:52.208 --> 01:56.208
The first model is Aui.
He's got a hot body.

01:56.291 --> 02:00.583
This is Lert. I have to say he's gorgeous.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.208
Next one, please.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.583
This is Korn. He's new.
He has been here for less than two months.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.291
He's covered in tattoos.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.666
Okay.

02:14.750 --> 02:18.000
This is Nui. He's still a college student.

02:18.583 --> 02:22.708
He dreams of producing movies.
He's still young.

02:22.791 --> 02:25.541
Are you ready for our special show?

02:25.625 --> 02:29.375
If you are, please give us
a round of applause.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.750
Fuck you.

04:20.666 --> 04:23.166
Do you want to be top or bottom today?

05:30.666 --> 05:31.666
See you later.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.375
Bye.

07:10.416 --> 07:12.833
Som, why are you still up?

07:13.666 --> 07:15.291
The doctor told you to rest a lot.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.208
I was waiting for you.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.541
Why are you home late again?

07:27.500 --> 07:29.375
I don't have enough money for tuition.

07:29.458 --> 07:32.208
I have no money. I have nothing.

07:32.291 --> 07:35.583
BOOZER KARAOKE

07:44.500 --> 07:49.083
Mister, how many of you are here today?

07:49.166 --> 07:53.666
Mister, can I sit with you?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.500
You are a generous man

07:55.583 --> 07:58.041
You give me a garlandevery time you come

07:58.125 --> 08:02.916
May I ask how many garlands
You are giving me today?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.625
Mister, you came so late today

08:07.708 --> 08:12.083
Mister, I got sleepy waiting for you

08:12.166 --> 08:16.458
Do you believe that I haven't got
a single garland today?

08:16.541 --> 08:18.333
I'm starving to death

08:18.416 --> 08:23.083
Because I was waiting for you

08:26.000 --> 08:28.041
BOOZER KARAOKE

08:28.125 --> 08:30.125
WELCOME

08:34.375 --> 08:35.583
See you later, Mister.

08:35.666 --> 08:38.083
Bee, come home with me.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.583
-I can't.
-Bee, come home with me.

08:40.666 --> 08:43.500
Mister, I'll go with you.

08:43.583 --> 08:47.166
Bee is on her period.
It will be a bloody sight.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.291
I'll go with you. Come on.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.041
-See you later.
-Bee.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.208
Let's go.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.791
I thought you were going with him.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.041
Nonsense.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.666
I would have if I wanted to.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.833
I'd rather ride on the back of your bike.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.458
You look much prettier like this.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.791
Don't sweet talk me.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.541
Give me a massage.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.000
Where would you like me to massage you?

09:47.666 --> 09:48.750
Here.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.041
Sorn.

09:53.791 --> 09:55.041
I have something for you.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.125
What is it?

10:03.916 --> 10:05.500
Let me help you with the rent.

10:05.583 --> 10:06.916
Do you have money?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.250
Of course, I just gave you some.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.791
Go lie on the bed.

10:38.458 --> 10:41.125
Do you want to be top or bottom today?

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
Top.

11:06.666 --> 11:11.583
ASSASSINATION

11:19.791 --> 11:20.791
Let me go.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.041
Let me go.

11:28.625 --> 11:29.625
Sorn.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.000
Yes.

11:34.958 --> 11:36.000
Sorn.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.375
Which shirt should I go with?
This or this?

11:41.958 --> 11:43.291
This one.

11:46.791 --> 11:47.625
Do you believe me?

11:47.708 --> 11:50.541
Of course. Why else would I ask you then?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.500
Why? Did you randomly pick one?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.166
No.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.166
The other one was too revealing,

12:02.250 --> 12:03.791
but it looked nicer.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.291
So the other one it is.

12:50.916 --> 12:52.666
-Is your body ready?
-Yes.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.375
-Is your heart ready?
-Yes.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.458
Is your money ready?

12:56.166 --> 12:57.250
No.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.041
That's too bad
because we are doing it today.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.875
PACKAGE DELIVERY AND MONEY TRANSFER
SERVICE TO SHAN STATE

13:01.958 --> 13:03.666
MONEY EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER
MYANMAR-THAILAND

13:03.750 --> 13:04.750
Take a seat.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.291
Did you bring the required documents?

13:09.166 --> 13:10.500
Birth certificate,

13:10.583 --> 13:12.708
a copy of your employer's
house registration,

13:12.791 --> 13:15.416
and a copy of your employer's
national ID card.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.166
We don't have anything.
Can we still use your service?

13:18.750 --> 13:23.000
Well, it will cost you extra
since you don't have documents.

13:23.583 --> 13:25.958
Normally, you must extend
your work permit every year

13:26.041 --> 13:28.541
and report yourselves

13:28.625 --> 13:32.083
to the immigration department
every three months.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.083
Did you know

13:34.833 --> 13:36.166
any of this?

13:37.291 --> 13:38.333
Not at all?

13:39.625 --> 13:41.375
It's okay.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.958
Come to me for help when the time comes.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.125
I have a question.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.125
Can I go on an airplane
once I have a passport?

13:51.208 --> 13:54.541
Yes, of course.

13:54.625 --> 13:59.666
You must board the plane from Thailand

13:59.750 --> 14:02.083
or go back to Myanmar first.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.541
But it's easier to just cross the border.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.958
How much is it?

14:08.041 --> 14:09.166
It's 20,000 bahts.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.458
Sorn.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.666
Sorn.

14:37.666 --> 14:38.666
Sorn.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.291
Sorn, you are daydreaming again.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.041
Nineteen, twenty.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.500
All 20,000 bahts are here.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.250
Are you doing it too?

14:50.125 --> 14:51.208
It's 20,000 bahts.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.583
-Thank you, Nan.
-You are welcome.

15:08.666 --> 15:12.541
KORWAN CO., LTD.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.500
I'm broke now.

15:14.583 --> 15:15.833
It's fine.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.875
Call Ji, your client.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.083
"Ji, give me some money.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.875
Ji, I need money
to buy a new phone, please."

15:23.958 --> 15:25.125
Fuck you, Korn.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.250
Take this.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.833
I can lift my legs.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.375
How about a race?

15:44.458 --> 15:45.291
Come on.

15:47.708 --> 15:48.833
What are you doing?

15:48.916 --> 15:50.541
Go.

17:01.458 --> 17:02.458
Everyone.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.083
Recently,

17:06.083 --> 17:07.958
the government made an announcement

17:08.875 --> 17:12.250
to close down entertainment venues
for 14 days.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.291
It includes

17:16.250 --> 17:17.583
our Doi Boy Club.

17:17.666 --> 17:19.500
-This sucks.
-What do we do?

17:19.583 --> 17:22.333
-This is unacceptable.
-It's not our fault.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.750
-Other people caused the problem.
-This sucks.

17:24.833 --> 17:26.125
What if my dad needs money?

17:26.208 --> 17:27.291
Aren't they going to help us?

17:27.375 --> 17:29.625
They took a lot of our money.
Where's the help?

17:29.708 --> 17:31.750
-How are we supposed to survive?
-All right, everyone. Be quiet.

17:32.416 --> 17:33.458
Anyway,

17:34.250 --> 17:37.083
I'll do my best to help all of you.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.041
Since today is our last day
before the break,

17:41.833 --> 17:43.416
our club will be packed.

17:44.041 --> 17:47.375
Let's get ready. Come on.
Customers will be here soon.

17:47.458 --> 17:53.541
-We will be jobless.
-Yes.

18:00.541 --> 18:01.541
No.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.708
It's okay. It's on me.

18:05.791 --> 18:08.333
One crispy noodle with gravy sauce to-go
for his wife, please.

18:08.416 --> 18:09.375
Sure.

18:15.666 --> 18:16.541
Hello, Ji.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.125
What brings you here, Joe?

18:24.916 --> 18:26.666
You know why I'm here.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.416
Think about it.

18:34.916 --> 18:36.500
You did a perfect job

18:37.833 --> 18:38.958
last time.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.250
You were untraceable
and impossible to catch.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.625
You know what will happen to you

18:48.000 --> 18:49.250
if you don't take this job, don't you?

18:56.125 --> 18:58.125
I came here to warn you.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.541
I don't want you to end up
like the last guy.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.083
I still want you to go home
to your wife and kid.

19:13.833 --> 19:17.083
Now that you are about to be a dad,
you should think carefully.

19:47.958 --> 19:49.375
Take him to the car.

19:49.458 --> 19:50.708
Let me go.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.375
Let me go, fucker.

19:54.833 --> 19:55.833
Let me go.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.083
Hello, Joe.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.458
I'll take the job.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.041
How's life as a soldier?

22:06.166 --> 22:09.791
Well, it isn't any different
from when I was a monk.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.375
Everybody wakes up,

22:14.958 --> 22:16.125
eats,

22:16.625 --> 22:18.000
and sleeps at the same time.

22:26.416 --> 22:32.416
Chiang Mai is a province
located in the north of Thailand

22:32.500 --> 22:38.416
with an area of approximately
20,107 sq km…

22:57.500 --> 23:00.916
I need all of you to enlist
and fight for our nation.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.916
We are happy as monks.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.291
Don't force them to leave the monkhood.

23:07.375 --> 23:10.208
We either kill them or get killed.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.375
Let me ask you this.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.125
Didn't the Shan people suffer

23:15.208 --> 23:18.833
when Myanmar robbed our food
and burned down our city?

23:19.333 --> 23:22.291
Are you just going to hide in the temple?

23:35.583 --> 23:37.333
What choice do we have?

23:38.125 --> 23:39.083
None.

23:39.666 --> 23:42.041
We don't have a choice.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.791
Why don't we flee to Thailand?

24:38.875 --> 24:40.375
It's very close to here.

24:42.166 --> 24:43.583
But you might

24:43.666 --> 24:45.916
not be able to come back again.

24:46.750 --> 24:50.416
Let's go. Screw this city-saving shit.

24:54.250 --> 24:57.958
It's easier said than done.

24:58.041 --> 24:59.791
You are daydreaming.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.291
I don't mind how things are now.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.666
We have a place to sleep and food to eat.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.000
Do you even know anyone in Thailand?

25:07.083 --> 25:09.541
Have you got your food
and shelter figured out?

25:11.166 --> 25:12.708
No, I have not.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.416
You are inviting me
when you don't have anything figured out.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.000
You don't even have a plan.

25:19.291 --> 25:20.416
I'm not going with you.

25:48.625 --> 25:49.916
Are you really fleeing?

26:01.708 --> 26:03.500
Are you coming with me?

26:12.958 --> 26:14.250
I'll get going then.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.166
Wan.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.541
Are you seriously leaving me here?

26:26.958 --> 26:28.750
I want you to come with me,

26:28.833 --> 26:31.000
but you won't

26:31.083 --> 26:33.166
so I'm choosing what's best for my future.

27:25.458 --> 27:28.125
How did you start working here?

27:36.166 --> 27:39.125
I worked many jobs before this one, Ji.

27:39.916 --> 27:42.750
I used to be a construction worker
and a server.

27:44.583 --> 27:46.416
I saved up money.

27:46.958 --> 27:49.041
My friend named Korn and I

27:49.125 --> 27:50.958
hired a driver

27:51.666 --> 27:54.083
to take us to Chiang Mai.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.083
Boys, wake up. We are here.

27:58.750 --> 27:59.750
Korn.

28:13.333 --> 28:14.333
Come quick.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.208
Come.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.083
Come quick.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Come here.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.041
Get in.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.083
Get in there.

28:24.791 --> 28:25.625
Hurry up.

28:25.708 --> 28:27.166
What for?

28:27.250 --> 28:28.625
Don't ask. Just get in.

29:03.458 --> 29:04.500
Hey, young man.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.041
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:06.125 --> 29:07.916
I haven't seen you in Thailand
for a while.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.541
What goods are you delivering today?

29:09.625 --> 29:11.333
Groceries, as usual.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.666
-Can I take a look?
-Go ahead.

29:16.583 --> 29:21.666
I was informed by word of mouth
that this job paid well

29:21.750 --> 29:23.375
so I decided to give it a try.

29:44.791 --> 29:45.833
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:45.916 --> 29:48.208
Hi, are you here to apply for a job?

29:48.791 --> 29:50.125
-Yes.
-What's your name?

29:50.208 --> 29:51.791
I'm Korn.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.083
I'm Wan.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.208
Wan?

29:55.291 --> 29:56.500
Wan again?

29:56.583 --> 29:57.791
His name is Wan.

29:59.375 --> 30:00.375
His name is also Wan.

30:00.875 --> 30:03.333
A few more of you
and I'll have a whole week.

30:05.166 --> 30:07.875
I'll give you a new name.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.833
Sorn.

30:15.250 --> 30:17.083
From now on, you are Sorn.

30:17.166 --> 30:20.375
Repeat after me, Sorn.

30:21.125 --> 30:23.375
-Sorn.
-Yes.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.833
Since today is your first day, work hard.

30:26.916 --> 30:28.708
You are new to Chiang Mai, aren't you?

30:29.250 --> 30:30.375
Yes.

30:30.458 --> 30:33.833
-How do you know?
-Those green shoes gave it away.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.625
Every soldier who flees the army
has those shoes.

30:37.208 --> 30:39.333
Since it's your first day, work hard.

30:39.416 --> 30:42.833
Kindly ask your customers for tips.
Work hard.

30:42.916 --> 30:44.708
-All right?
-Thank you.

30:49.625 --> 30:50.583
Handsome.

30:59.375 --> 31:01.541
The job felt weird at first,

31:01.625 --> 31:05.416
but I got used to it after a while.

31:09.875 --> 31:10.916
Guess what I bought

31:11.458 --> 31:14.875
after I got my first check.

31:17.291 --> 31:18.375
A motorbike?

31:18.916 --> 31:20.083
No.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.250
A phone?

31:25.333 --> 31:26.500
No.

31:28.791 --> 31:30.208
It was a pair of shoes.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.083
Why?

31:32.166 --> 31:34.333
My friends here teased me

31:34.416 --> 31:36.250
about my old shoes.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.166
Really?

31:39.750 --> 31:40.750
Yes.

31:42.583 --> 31:46.500
I have to blend in with Thai people
as much as I can.

31:47.708 --> 31:50.750
When the police see foreigners
with those shoes

31:50.833 --> 31:52.083
and who look out of place,

31:52.583 --> 31:54.041
they often ask to see ID.

31:54.583 --> 31:59.041
I'm terrified of the police.
They always extort money.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.958
Policemen are dicks.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.791
The truth is I sneaked in quietly.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.208
I picked the lock.

32:59.083 --> 33:00.666
REVENGE

33:08.208 --> 33:09.250
NEEWAK

33:10.625 --> 33:11.583
STOP ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE

33:31.333 --> 33:32.541
What did he do?

33:34.125 --> 33:35.416
He was a bad man.

33:37.666 --> 33:40.125
He caused social conflict and disharmony.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.041
Stop hurting the people!

33:41.125 --> 33:42.750
He kept blaming the government.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.458
It's tear gas! Run!

33:45.541 --> 33:49.291
Nothing would have happened
if he had kept to his duty as a student.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.541
Tyrant bootlickers!

33:51.125 --> 33:53.041
Our country needed peace.

33:53.125 --> 33:56.000
-Fuck you!
-Your salary is our tax payment!

34:07.708 --> 34:08.708
Ji.

34:10.208 --> 34:13.208
Can I go with you after our session ends?

34:14.166 --> 34:17.250
You are usually in a rush to go home.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.500
I only have 400 bahts left on me.

34:23.250 --> 34:24.958
The club will close from tomorrow.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.750
I don't know what I'm going to do.

34:32.666 --> 34:34.125
Sure.

34:34.958 --> 34:36.333
Come with me tonight.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.500
Let's find something exciting to do.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.208
Thank you.

35:06.208 --> 35:07.916
NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECTED
TO ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE

35:08.916 --> 35:11.291
Do you see the guy putting up the posters?

35:12.875 --> 35:14.250
His name is Wuth.

35:14.333 --> 35:15.750
He's 22 years old.

35:16.875 --> 35:19.250
On the outside,
he looks like an ordinary boy.

35:20.458 --> 35:22.208
He was probably out drinking.

35:25.708 --> 35:27.375
He's my next target.

35:31.833 --> 35:35.166
Would you be interested

35:35.916 --> 35:37.041
in a job?

35:37.958 --> 35:39.125
I would.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.416
What kind of job is it?

35:42.250 --> 35:43.250
A guide.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.916
Show me and my friend around
your hometown in Myanmar.

35:48.916 --> 35:51.000
How will you get there?

35:51.083 --> 35:53.583
Isn't the border closed due to COVID-19?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.041
The same way you entered Thailand.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.250
But

36:01.916 --> 36:04.291
it's very dangerous.

36:05.541 --> 36:09.416
I don't want to go back to my country now.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.791
Are you going to show us
around your hometown or not?

36:21.500 --> 36:22.666
No, sorry.

36:34.416 --> 36:39.041
BOOZER KARAOKE

36:39.125 --> 36:40.333
Hey, Sorn.

36:40.916 --> 36:42.583
-See you later.
-See you.

36:45.291 --> 36:47.208
No man is trying to take you home tonight.

36:47.291 --> 36:50.791
There weren't any customers.
I didn't get any tips.

36:51.333 --> 36:53.750
It's okay. Things will be better tomorrow.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.041
The bar will be closed from tomorrow.

36:57.791 --> 37:00.416
It's not the end of the world.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.500
Let's go home.

37:35.041 --> 37:36.208
Come on. Give me a smile.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.416
Sorn.

38:20.166 --> 38:21.166
Sorn.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.333
Sorn.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.916
Have you paid the rent?

38:37.875 --> 38:40.166
I asked, have you paid the rent?

38:42.375 --> 38:43.375
No.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.041
Where's the money I gave you?

38:48.250 --> 38:49.458
What did you do with it?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.416
I used it to get a passport.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.333
How are we going to live?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.958
I thought I would be able
to make more money if I had a passport

39:01.041 --> 39:02.333
so I borrowed your money.

39:02.416 --> 39:03.791
Where's your passport then?

39:03.875 --> 39:04.958
Where's the money?

39:05.833 --> 39:07.708
Things are slow during the pandemic.

39:07.791 --> 39:08.750
The club is closed.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.416
Then why did you spend the money?

39:10.500 --> 39:11.458
What was I supposed to do?

39:11.541 --> 39:13.041
Why didn't you ask me first?

39:22.250 --> 39:23.250
Hello, Nan.

39:23.333 --> 39:24.583
-Hello.
-Hello.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.000
Wash your hands first.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.833
You are not wearing a mask.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.583
We want to know
the status of our passports.

39:30.666 --> 39:35.041
The process started only a few days ago.
They aren't ready yet. Be patient.

39:35.125 --> 39:36.875
Can we have our money back?

39:37.458 --> 39:40.041
I'm sorry, but it's too late for a refund.

39:40.750 --> 39:43.666
Do you know
when our passports will be ready?

39:43.750 --> 39:46.375
Listen, I'm waiting
for your passports too.

39:46.458 --> 39:49.541
But you know how the pandemic

39:49.625 --> 39:51.625
is slowing everything down.

39:52.125 --> 39:55.250
But the passports aren't here yet.
What are you doing with our money?

39:55.333 --> 39:59.750
I didn't force you to give me the money.

39:59.833 --> 40:02.458
You walked in here yourselves.
Do you remember?

40:02.541 --> 40:03.875
I remember.

40:03.958 --> 40:07.000
But I need the money.
Can you give me back the money?

40:07.083 --> 40:08.875
Help me out, please.

40:08.958 --> 40:11.166
I'm doing the best I can.

40:11.250 --> 40:13.541
Don't you understand
that it's the pandemic?

40:13.625 --> 40:14.916
-We should go.
-I understand.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.166
-Yes, go home.
-Let's go, Sorn.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.541
I'll call you
when the passports are ready.

40:17.625 --> 40:18.875
Don't ask me again.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.375
I have no choice
since I've run out of money.

40:21.458 --> 40:23.333
He talks like we are rich or something.

40:23.416 --> 40:26.166
The pandemic
is taking a toll on all of us.

40:31.666 --> 40:33.750
I need two carpenters
and two concrete finishers.

40:39.375 --> 40:40.500
You can go.

40:56.291 --> 40:58.791
It didn't use to be this hot
when we first got here.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.333
We wouldn't have decided

41:01.416 --> 41:04.791
to work at the club if we hadn't thought
labor work was hot and tiring.

41:04.875 --> 41:07.041
Yes, you are right.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.541
I need five workers.

41:29.916 --> 41:30.916
Hey.

41:31.833 --> 41:34.791
What type of job
do you think he has for us?

41:34.875 --> 41:36.666
Whatever it is, just do it.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.458
The police are here.

43:41.541 --> 43:42.541
Go.

43:43.041 --> 43:44.041
Sorn!

43:46.500 --> 43:48.291
May I see your work permit?

43:59.041 --> 44:02.000
What documents do you have?

44:02.500 --> 44:03.833
Do you have a passport?

44:08.166 --> 44:12.625
If you don't have any documents,
we will have to lock you up.

44:14.458 --> 44:16.500
But my passport is arriving soon.

44:17.083 --> 44:19.041
I have a number you can call.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.291
No.

44:22.291 --> 44:25.375
Can I talk to your boss then?

44:25.958 --> 44:28.416
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

44:28.916 --> 44:31.458
Hey, lock him up.

44:31.541 --> 44:32.750
He's pissing me off.

44:32.833 --> 44:34.333
Please calm down, Lieutenant.

44:34.416 --> 44:36.250
I'll take care of him.

44:36.333 --> 44:37.333
All right.

44:39.458 --> 44:40.458
Ji.

44:49.041 --> 44:50.416
Are you a cop?

44:54.541 --> 44:57.958
What happened to you?
What brought you here today?

44:58.833 --> 45:00.833
I was arrested for having no passport.

45:00.916 --> 45:03.625
Really? Hasn't Nan given you the passport?

45:05.791 --> 45:07.916
Do you know Nan?

45:11.791 --> 45:14.041
Do you remember the job I offered you?

45:15.916 --> 45:17.250
What do you think now?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.333
Have you changed your mind?

45:22.625 --> 45:23.916
What are you talking about?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.125
I want you to be my guide

45:28.208 --> 45:31.166
and take me and my friend to your hometown

45:31.833 --> 45:33.541
in Myanmar.

45:39.833 --> 45:42.333
I don't know why
you don't want to go back home.

45:44.125 --> 45:45.916
But if you don't want to go to jail,

45:47.250 --> 45:48.625
you will have to help me.

45:57.041 --> 45:59.083
Will I be able to come back to Thailand

45:59.166 --> 46:00.791
if I cross the border?

46:25.583 --> 46:27.291
This is just a partial payment.

46:28.541 --> 46:30.166
Once you finish the job,

46:31.208 --> 46:32.541
I will pay you money too.

46:37.958 --> 46:39.916
But you have to promise me first

46:41.791 --> 46:43.333
that you will help me.

46:51.833 --> 46:54.375
I've checked the VPN. It's secured.

46:54.458 --> 46:56.208
They won't be able to trace us.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.666
Bitch, I know it's dangerous,
but I have to retrieve the hard disk.

47:05.791 --> 47:09.125
I'll recheck everything again
before I leak it tomorrow.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.083
Have you prepared

47:12.958 --> 47:14.625
an escape route for me?

47:15.666 --> 47:17.333
They aren't joking around this time.

47:19.958 --> 47:21.125
See you soon.

47:21.666 --> 47:22.916
Bye.

47:25.916 --> 47:29.625
I have a gun. Don't make a noise.
Don't resist. Just follow me.

47:33.833 --> 47:35.916
Calm down, boy. Calm down.

48:04.750 --> 48:05.958
You are Wuth, right?

48:11.125 --> 48:14.041
Why are you so concerned
about human trafficking?

48:16.208 --> 48:18.291
Why are you risking your life over it?

48:20.541 --> 48:22.541
Do you know who you are messing with?

48:27.833 --> 48:29.750
I have every reason to.

48:31.958 --> 48:33.708
Put yourself in my shoes.

48:34.791 --> 48:36.583
You would do the same thing as me

48:38.125 --> 48:39.708
if you were in my position.

48:41.208 --> 48:42.708
Have you thought of it that way?

48:56.041 --> 48:59.041
Do you really think
you can change the system?

49:00.833 --> 49:02.333
It's better than doing nothing.

49:03.458 --> 49:04.541
Honestly,

49:05.166 --> 49:06.541
I wouldn't be sitting here

49:07.916 --> 49:09.416
if Bhoom was still alive.

49:16.666 --> 49:17.916
Is it worth it?

49:19.458 --> 49:21.666
I might kill you today.

49:23.541 --> 49:24.875
Do you think it will be over?

49:27.166 --> 49:28.541
When I go missing,

49:30.958 --> 49:33.041
someone else will come out
and fight for me.

49:35.208 --> 49:37.083
Just like how I'm fighting for Bhoom.

49:43.333 --> 49:44.625
I'm wondering

49:45.333 --> 49:49.208
if it was your parents, your kid,

49:49.291 --> 49:50.708
or your wife

49:50.791 --> 49:52.083
sitting here, not me,

49:53.458 --> 49:55.958
would you treat them
the way you are treating me now?

49:58.333 --> 49:59.500
You murderer.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.333
Breakfast is ready, Bhoom.

51:07.375 --> 51:08.958
Eat your breakfast first.

51:11.416 --> 51:12.958
Wuth, look at this.

51:13.041 --> 51:15.000
Eaun sent this to me.

51:15.083 --> 51:16.708
The documents say

51:18.208 --> 51:22.125
that high-ranking officials and executives
are involved in human trafficking.

51:39.791 --> 51:41.166
What's your plan?

51:44.291 --> 51:45.666
I'm going to expose them.

51:52.625 --> 51:53.625
I'll be right back.

51:56.666 --> 51:57.875
Bhoom.

51:59.458 --> 52:00.750
Why don't you eat first?

52:02.375 --> 52:03.708
I'll be back to eat soon.

52:06.541 --> 52:07.541
See you later.

52:42.166 --> 52:43.875
What are you going to do next?

52:50.166 --> 52:53.208
We just have to get Wuth ordained
at the temple you ordained at.

52:54.291 --> 52:55.666
And everything will be over.

53:08.166 --> 53:09.875
Are you going to kill him?

53:13.416 --> 53:16.083
I'm supposed to get rid of Wuth

53:16.791 --> 53:18.083
like I did Bhoom.

53:19.791 --> 53:21.208
But I'm not going to kill him.

53:23.958 --> 53:25.333
I've committed enough sin.

53:31.833 --> 53:34.250
Why did you do it the first time then?

53:38.083 --> 53:39.916
Back then, I had no choice.

53:42.291 --> 53:43.750
But I have a choice now.

53:45.333 --> 53:46.791
Because I have you.

54:03.958 --> 54:05.708
What about me? Do I have a choice?

54:20.291 --> 54:21.291
What's wrong?

54:22.958 --> 54:25.291
A checkpoint. There's a checkpoint ahead.

54:36.958 --> 54:39.583
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

55:01.125 --> 55:02.291
Please untie me.

55:04.833 --> 55:06.041
Let's run away together.

55:08.250 --> 55:09.541
Let's run away, Sorn.

55:10.833 --> 55:17.583
STOP THE CAR

55:17.666 --> 55:18.625
Let them pass.

55:28.458 --> 55:29.750
I need a backup!

55:43.416 --> 55:44.708
Let's split up.

55:50.166 --> 55:51.916
Hey, where are you going?

55:52.583 --> 55:54.250
I can't trust you.

55:54.333 --> 55:55.416
But thank you.

56:30.583 --> 56:31.666
Don't run away again.

56:50.125 --> 56:51.791
You will be home soon, Sorn.

56:52.541 --> 56:53.416
Are you happy?

56:59.250 --> 57:00.875
I don't want to go home.

57:09.041 --> 57:10.333
We will arrive soon, Wuth.

57:16.791 --> 57:18.083
Shut the fuck up.

57:22.791 --> 57:24.625
I heard everything.

57:26.750 --> 57:28.166
You killed Bhoom.

57:29.708 --> 57:31.250
You are a murderer.

57:32.291 --> 57:34.583
I'm supposed to kill you too.
You know that, right?

57:38.541 --> 57:40.958
I'm risking my life to save yours.

57:43.500 --> 57:47.250
You will be dead
if I don't bring you across the border.

57:47.916 --> 57:49.166
And it won't just be you.

57:50.125 --> 57:53.041
Your parents, siblings, and friends
will die too.

57:55.333 --> 57:57.125
I'm helping you right now.

57:58.958 --> 58:00.416
You aren't doing shit.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.833
It doesn't matter if I die or not,

58:03.916 --> 58:08.125
but people shouldn't be erased
for trying to say the truth.

59:02.375 --> 59:03.458
How far?

59:04.958 --> 59:07.125
It's a short walk from here.

59:09.208 --> 59:10.500
Can I take a break?

59:11.166 --> 59:12.166
What?

59:12.750 --> 59:14.000
Can I take a break?

59:15.458 --> 59:17.166
Sure. Sorn, let's take a break here.

59:36.958 --> 59:38.416
It'll be easier to walk around.

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:07.291
Who are you? Hands up.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.958
Ji, Wuth, put your hands up.

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:21.250
Yoon?

01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:24.500
Wan?

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:29.958
Tie them up.

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.958
-Come here.
-Come.

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:55.750
You are Wan, aren't you?

01:01:58.041 --> 01:02:00.500
Why the fuck did you come back?

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:06.458
Why?

01:02:08.916 --> 01:02:10.958
Is it so bad to be a soldier?

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:12.916
Is it?

01:02:15.916 --> 01:02:17.125
Say something.

01:02:24.666 --> 01:02:26.333
You, son of a bitch.

01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:27.833
You, coward.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.208
You ran away,

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:36.333
leaving your family
to fight for your nation.

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:40.958
We've never won against Myanmar

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:43.666
because of people like you.

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:50.125
Everyone, lock him up in prison.

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.208
Yes, sir.

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.375
Yoon.

01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:30.875
I'm your friend.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.541
I'm your friend.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:01.125
Yoon, are you going to leave me here?

01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:05.333
Why the fuck
did you come back then, idiot?

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:10.333
You don't want to kill me.

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.291
You want me to survive.

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:19.000
You want to torture me

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:22.666
by making me live in hiding.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:30.791
So you can feel better about yourself
for not killing me.

01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:38.708
But it's too late to right your wrongs.

01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.833
You've killed someone.

01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:49.250
He's not coming back.

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:43.541
Just follow your boss's order.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:53.958
Finish me off.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.250
Don't you realize at all

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:03.375
that I brought you all the way here

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:07.375
and I'm sparing your life

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:09.916
because I want to quit?

01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:16.541
You want to quit?

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:23.375
Do you see now
how fucked up the system is?

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:28.458
Fucker, soon enough,

01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:32.416
the system will collapse
and crush everyone under it,

01:06:33.708 --> 01:06:35.041
including yourself.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:43.541
Someone's coming. Hide.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.041
Stay here.

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.916
What are they trying to do?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.583
I told them to go back to Thailand.
Why are they still here?

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.250
They don't want to return to Thailand.

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:13.041
They came here to take
that man to the temple.

01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:14.875
I see.

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:16.916
Let's take a break.

01:08:25.458 --> 01:08:27.208
What's the plan?

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:29.166
Ji, what's the plan?

01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:37.541
I'm leaving Wuth with you.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.666
You have to take Wuth to the temple.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.458
As for me,

01:08:45.833 --> 01:08:47.291
I have to return to Thailand.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.791
If they can't contact me
when the sun rises,

01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:52.833
we will all be in trouble.

01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:08.208
If I bring you back to Thailand,

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:13.875
I will have to kill you.

01:09:17.583 --> 01:09:19.041
I have no choice.

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:24.458
Please stay here.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:27.500
It's for your own good.

01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:37.250
All your belongings are in this bag.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.916
Wan.

01:09:57.708 --> 01:09:59.375
Can you do me a favor?

01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:02.541
What is it?

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.166
Can you tell him to shoot me
in the shoulder?

01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:20.666
Ji, he asks you
to shoot him in the shoulder.

01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:27.666
Let's use my gun.
It will be more believable.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:31.875
Cover your ears.

01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:55.416
Are we almost there yet?

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:58.791
Just keep walking.
We'll get there eventually.

01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:01.333
What does that mean?

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:07.750
It means stop complaining
and keep walking.

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:25.625
Hurry up.

01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:27.958
Come on.

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:41.375
Come on, let's take a swim.

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:50.833
Just strip naked.

01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:35.625
Come on.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.625
Wait a second.

01:13:59.208 --> 01:14:00.208
It's cold.

01:14:03.791 --> 01:14:04.791
Stop.

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:06.416
Hey.

01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:08.375
Stop.

01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:26.083
I wonder if I'll miss home.

01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:32.375
I might miss Thailand like crazy.

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:38.291
I thought you hated Thailand.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.625
How can I hate my home country?

01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:48.666
I love my home country.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.375
I want to make it better.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:14:58.875
I want to live a good life

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.666
with the person I love.

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:17.291
I don't even know where to call home.

01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:41.583
It's okay.

01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:07.916
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

01:18:08.791 --> 01:18:10.125
Do I have to hold it tightly?

01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:12.333
-Yes.
-Okay.

01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:16.041
-Next, you twist it with your right hand.
-Next…

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.000
Like this?

01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:19.125
Hold it. Pull it tight.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:21.000
-Twist it like this?
-Yes.

01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:22.583
I have to hold it high.

01:18:22.666 --> 01:18:24.375
-Not too high.
-Okay.

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.083
-Like this?
-Yes.

01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:32.500
-After that…
-I take my arm out like this, right?

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.791
-Yes.
-Now what?

01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:38.166
Then place it on your shoulder.

01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:50.541
Don't I look pretty, Mrs. Sorn?

01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:05.375
My mind might run even wilder here.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.833
You'll get used to it soon.

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:14.375
Think of this temple

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.875
as another home of yours.

01:19:20.708 --> 01:19:22.000
Yes.

01:19:22.083 --> 01:19:23.541
I guess I'll do that.

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.083
This is yours.

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:53.166
Ji left it for you.

01:20:14.458 --> 01:20:16.083
Use it to return to Thailand.

01:24:24.708 --> 01:24:27.000
Bee, why the long face?

01:24:31.416 --> 01:24:33.041
Have you not found Sorn yet?

01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:36.375
No.

01:24:38.208 --> 01:24:39.583
Why don't you report him missing?

01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:44.458
There's no point
reporting a missing alien.

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:46.375
Nobody will give a darn.

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:51.791
They will extort him for money.

01:24:52.833 --> 01:24:54.375
He doesn't have any documents.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:56.625
Poor guy.

01:24:57.541 --> 01:24:59.166
I feel sorry for him.

01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:03.541
Stay with Daddy Meng for the time being.

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:06.750
I heard he's a sugar daddy.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.375
Hey.

01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:16.333
He's offering to give you so many things,

01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:18.625
a condo and a car.

01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:21.791
Just accept them.
Don't think about it too much.

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:23.625
The pandemic isn't over yet.

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:28.833
Use those assets to start a life
with your boyfriend.

01:25:37.416 --> 01:25:38.333
This bitch.

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:49.208
Put a smile on your face.
You are paid to be here.

01:25:56.375 --> 01:25:58.208
Here I come.

01:26:00.916 --> 01:26:04.416
-Where were you?
-I'm here. That's enough.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.375
You are late to the party.

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:10.625
After this glass, someone's taking a dip.

01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:35.625
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:26:35.708 --> 01:26:37.875
-How much?
-It's 1,500 bahts.

01:26:37.958 --> 01:26:39.791
Come on, the economy is bad.

01:26:41.666 --> 01:26:42.625
How about 1,200 bahts?

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:45.583
I will pay 1,000 bahts.

01:26:47.708 --> 01:26:48.625
Deal.

01:26:48.708 --> 01:26:51.541
What will you do for 1,000 bahts?

01:26:51.625 --> 01:26:53.541
It's up to you. I'll do anything.

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:56.250
Get in.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.375
It's hard being poor.

01:27:41.333 --> 01:27:42.458
Not really.

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.625
Whatever, Mr. Billionaire.

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:54.333
What does a luxurious life sound like?

01:27:54.958 --> 01:27:56.166
Well…

01:27:56.958 --> 01:27:59.791
Once I win the lottery,

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.291
we will run away together,

01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:05.708
stay in a fancy hotel, and stuff ourselves

01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:07.250
to death with seafood.

01:28:07.333 --> 01:28:08.250
How does that sound?

01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.541
How much are you paying me?

01:28:49.916 --> 01:28:50.791
Som.

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:53.750
Inspector.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:55.750
Have you heard from Ji?

01:28:56.583 --> 01:28:57.416
No.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.416
But I've sent every man looking for him.

01:29:03.041 --> 01:29:04.875
You didn't need to come all the way here.

01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:17.958
It could be you!

01:29:18.041 --> 01:29:19.375
-It could be you!
-It could be you!

01:29:19.458 --> 01:29:21.125
It could be you!

01:29:21.208 --> 01:29:22.875
-It could be you!
-It could be you!
