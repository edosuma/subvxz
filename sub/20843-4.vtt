Announcer:
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.406 --> 00:05.310
‐ Gordon: A grocery bag.
‐ Christina: You couldn't level

00:05.310 --> 00:07.516
the playing field any more
than we have tonight.

00:07.516 --> 00:10.522
Announcer:
<i>The first mystery box challenge</i>
<i>of the season,</i>

00:10.522 --> 00:12.157
<i>sent three home cooks...</i>

00:12.157 --> 00:14.763
These have no place
in the MasterChef kitchen.

00:14.763 --> 00:16.600
<i>to the bottom</i>
<i>of the competition.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:18.638
‐ Gordon: Do those bags
look familiar?
‐ Yep. Yes, Chef.

00:18.638 --> 00:20.775
<i>And in a fight</i>
<i>for redemption...</i>

00:20.775 --> 00:23.346
‐ Why kebab?
‐ Do what I do
and ignore them.

00:23.346 --> 00:24.950
‐ Gordon: Is this
a joke for you?
‐ <i>It was Mark...</i>

00:24.950 --> 00:27.889
Take it serious
or take your apron off.

00:27.889 --> 00:30.995
Announcer:
<i>...who failed</i>
<i>to make the cut.</i>

00:30.995 --> 00:31.997
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:31.997 --> 00:33.668
( cheering )

00:33.668 --> 00:35.838
I think that may be
David Hasselhoff.

00:35.838 --> 00:38.176
<i>The competition kicks</i>
<i>into high gear.</i>

00:38.176 --> 00:40.748
Gordon:
Our lifeguards
are arriving.

00:40.748 --> 00:43.588
<i>And it's sink or swim</i>
<i>as the top 19...</i>

00:43.588 --> 00:45.090
Gordon:
Let's go red team,
blue team.

00:45.090 --> 00:47.929
<i>...face their</i>
<i>first team challenge</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

00:47.929 --> 00:49.666
<i>Who will save the day?</i>

00:49.666 --> 00:51.770
‐ Yay!
‐ We got the best fish
over here.

00:51.770 --> 00:54.075
<i>And who will be</i>
<i>lost at sea?</i>

00:54.075 --> 00:55.778
‐ It's raw?
‐ ( bleep ) raw!

00:55.778 --> 00:58.718
You may as well
take your aprons off
and go home now.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.466
Announcer:
<i>The surf is up</i>

01:06.466 --> 01:08.203
<i>in Huntington Beach,</i>
<i>California</i>

01:08.203 --> 01:10.908
<i>as our 19 home cooks</i>
<i>arrive to compete</i>

01:10.908 --> 01:14.983
<i>in their very first</i>
<i>MasterChef team challenge.</i>

01:14.983 --> 01:18.156
First team challenge
is so exhilarating.

01:18.156 --> 01:22.532
<i>The pressure is very real.</i>
<i>Game face is on.</i>

01:22.532 --> 01:24.569
Whoo!

01:27.107 --> 01:29.713
Hey guys, we got judges
coming up on the beach.

01:29.713 --> 01:32.117
‐ Man: Oh, my God!
‐ Woman: Stop it.

01:32.117 --> 01:33.554
Check it out!

01:33.554 --> 01:35.090
Woman: <i>Whoo!</i>

01:35.090 --> 01:37.428
Jennifer:
<i>The judges are rolling up</i>
<i>on their ATVs.</i>

01:37.428 --> 01:39.599
It is very much
like a "Baywatch" moment.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.704
<i>They're just riding up,</i>
<i>bouncing around,</i>

01:41.704 --> 01:44.108
<i>the hair flowing</i>
<i>in the wind.</i>

01:44.108 --> 01:46.747
I think that may
be David Hasselhoff
in the distance.

01:46.747 --> 01:50.087
Woman:
Whoo! There's Gordon!

01:50.087 --> 01:54.061
( cheers, applause )

01:54.061 --> 01:57.000
This is actually
pretty damn badass.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.336
Gordon:
Wow!

01:58.336 --> 02:00.708
‐ Welcome, everybody.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

02:00.708 --> 02:04.415
We wanted to give you
a picture‐perfect
beach backdrop

02:04.415 --> 02:07.622
for your very first
MasterChef team challenge.

02:07.622 --> 02:11.395
And today, you're gonna
be cooking for 101...

02:11.395 --> 02:12.899
lifeguards!

02:12.899 --> 02:14.603
( cheers, applause )

02:14.603 --> 02:17.241
And we're going
to be treating them
to a lavish MasterChef lunch

02:17.241 --> 02:19.311
and thank them
for all that they do.

02:19.311 --> 02:21.449
‐ Brien.
‐ Yes, Chef.

02:21.449 --> 02:24.656
You were the winner
of the first mystery box
challenge.

02:24.656 --> 02:27.461
Today you'll be one
of our team captains.

02:27.461 --> 02:29.498
‐ BOB!
‐ You got 'em, BOB!

02:29.498 --> 02:32.237
Brien:
<i>I am excited, but nervous</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

02:32.237 --> 02:34.576
As a magazine
advertising salesman,

02:34.576 --> 02:38.082
<i>I work by myself,</i>
<i>so working with other people</i>
<i>and directing them,</i>

02:38.082 --> 02:39.418
<i>is gonna be new to me.</i>

02:39.418 --> 02:42.124
First off, I'm gonna
ask you 18 home cooks

02:42.124 --> 02:45.765
to put yourselves
into two even teams
of nine.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.301
Figure out who you
want to work with,

02:47.301 --> 02:48.871
figure out who
you don't want
to work with.

02:48.871 --> 02:50.641
Knowing a little bit
about my contestants,

02:50.641 --> 02:52.879
<i>I see Necco,</i>
<i>I see Eboni.</i>

02:52.879 --> 02:54.683
We have the same ideas
about ingredients

02:54.683 --> 02:56.052
and how they go together
on the plate.

02:56.052 --> 02:57.655
Daniel:
<i>Jennifer's definitely</i>
<i>proven herself.</i>

02:57.655 --> 02:59.491
She was in the top three
last week.

02:59.491 --> 03:02.231
There are some people
that I'm not that into.

03:02.231 --> 03:06.573
Paige stands out to me.
She's young. She's naive.

03:06.573 --> 03:08.109
I don't think
she really has that palate.

03:08.109 --> 03:10.648
‐ Is everyone ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.821
Three, two, one, go!

03:13.821 --> 03:15.858
( overlapping chattering )

03:15.858 --> 03:17.862
Come over here,
come over here. Right here.

03:17.862 --> 03:19.633
I say a quick prayer,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.703
"Lord, put me on
the right team

03:21.703 --> 03:22.972
with the right people."

03:22.972 --> 03:25.611
( cheers, applause )

03:25.611 --> 03:27.114
Interesting choices.
Well done.

03:27.114 --> 03:30.721
Now, Brien, I would like
you to walk

03:30.721 --> 03:33.026
over to the team
you would like to lead.

03:33.026 --> 03:35.497
‐ Okay.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

03:35.497 --> 03:37.401
BOB's the man.

03:37.401 --> 03:39.873
I know exactly
where I want to go.

03:39.873 --> 03:41.710
‐ Uh oh, a little fake out?
‐ Oh, he's going to red.

03:41.710 --> 03:42.712
He is faking us out.

03:42.712 --> 03:43.814
Brien:
<i>I look at the red team,</i>

03:43.814 --> 03:44.983
<i>I see smart.</i>

03:44.983 --> 03:46.753
I see people that will
follow direction,

03:46.753 --> 03:47.922
<i>and I see a winning team.</i>

03:47.922 --> 03:49.693
I'm picking the red team.

03:49.693 --> 03:51.697
‐ Woman: Yeah!
‐ Gordon: Wow.

03:51.697 --> 03:53.032
Team captain apron, bud.
Well done.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.869
( cheers, applause )

03:54.869 --> 03:58.076
All right, blue team.
Now it's up to you to
select a team captain.

03:58.076 --> 04:00.180
‐ Jen?
‐ Woman: I'm with Jennifer.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.315
‐ Yeah, I'll do it.
‐ Man: I have no problem
with Jennifer.

04:01.315 --> 04:03.186
I'm all right with that.
I'm all right with that.

04:03.186 --> 04:05.390
‐ Already,
you've found one?
‐ All: Yes.

04:05.390 --> 04:09.064
All right,
so Jennifer, are you ready
for this enormous challenge?

04:09.064 --> 04:10.701
Yes, I'm ready 100%.

04:10.701 --> 04:13.206
I think that
I can lead people.
I do it every day.

04:13.206 --> 04:14.208
Excellent.

04:14.208 --> 04:15.878
Christina:
Now, we want to reward

04:15.878 --> 04:18.383
these hard‐working
men and women with
some incredible dishes

04:18.383 --> 04:20.320
we know they'll love.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.694
Featuring fresh from
the Pacific this morning,

04:23.694 --> 04:26.533
rockfish
and striped sea bass,

04:26.533 --> 04:29.438
two extremely different
types of fish.

04:29.438 --> 04:32.545
Now rockfish is
a relatively humble protein,

04:32.545 --> 04:34.682
delicious when done right

04:34.682 --> 04:36.887
but very, very,
very easy to mess up.

04:36.887 --> 04:40.260
Next off, the incredible
striped sea bass.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.632
Flaky, silky,
smooth in texture,

04:42.632 --> 04:45.738
but striped sea bass
is temperamental.

04:45.738 --> 04:48.309
It demands absolute
precision of the cook.

04:48.309 --> 04:50.581
‐ So, Brien.
‐ Yes, Chef.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.887
Your advantages today
are not yet over.

04:53.887 --> 04:56.593
You now get to choose
which protein

04:56.593 --> 04:58.931
your team gets
to work with.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.501
Sea bass, Chef.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.705
Gordon:
So blue team, that means

05:02.705 --> 05:04.441
you'll be cooking
with the rockfish.

05:04.441 --> 05:06.513
Christina:
Now each team is going
to be responsible

05:06.513 --> 05:08.784
for a beautiful,
fully‐composed dish.

05:08.784 --> 05:11.188
That means
your star protein,
two stunning sides,

05:11.188 --> 05:12.725
and an incredible sauce.

05:12.725 --> 05:14.929
‐ Are you ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

05:14.929 --> 05:17.400
Your time starts...

05:17.400 --> 05:18.904
‐ now, let's go.
‐ Let's go.

05:18.904 --> 05:20.406
‐ Go, go, go, go, go.
‐ Let's do this.

05:20.406 --> 05:23.246
Announcer:
<i>Both teams now have</i>
<i>just 60 minutes</i>

05:23.246 --> 05:25.551
<i>to create</i>
<i>a MasterChef‐worthy lunch.</i>

05:25.551 --> 05:27.555
<i>The lifeguards</i>
<i>will taste both dishes,</i>

05:27.555 --> 05:29.726
<i>and then decide</i>
<i>the winning team.</i>

05:29.726 --> 05:32.999
<i>The losing team will face</i>
<i>the dreaded pressure test.</i>

05:32.999 --> 05:35.303
We're going to do
a crispy‐skin sea bass.

05:35.303 --> 05:37.642
Eboni, Newton and Necco,
you guys are on that.

05:37.642 --> 05:39.512
‐ I got that.
‐ We need a starch.

05:39.512 --> 05:40.948
I saw some bamboo rice.

05:40.948 --> 05:42.652
‐ Bamboo rice, bamboo rice.
‐ Bamboo rice, okay.

05:42.652 --> 05:45.323
Brien, from the get‐go,
is an awesome team captain.

05:45.323 --> 05:47.027
The peas would be nice
with the rice.

05:47.027 --> 05:48.830
The peas with the rice.
Good, good, good, good, good.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.668
He's listening to us,
he's trying to filter

05:50.668 --> 05:53.139
<i>and trying to figure out</i>
<i>what we can do as a team</i>

05:53.139 --> 05:55.376
that's gonna be delicious
and win us this challenge.

05:55.376 --> 05:56.846
‐ Everybody clear?
‐ All: Yes.

05:56.846 --> 05:58.349
Woman:
<i>Let's do it!</i>

05:58.349 --> 06:00.220
Announcer:
<i>While Captain Brien</i>
<i>has strong ideas</i>

06:00.220 --> 06:02.123
<i>for his red team's</i>
<i>direction,</i>

06:02.123 --> 06:05.831
<i>on the blue team,</i>
<i>Captain Jennifer</i>
<i>is less decisive.</i>

06:05.831 --> 06:07.935
For the fish,
right now, I want that

06:07.935 --> 06:09.438
to be the star
of the dish,

06:09.438 --> 06:11.509
I want that‐‐
I want paprika,
I want salt and pepper,

06:11.509 --> 06:12.778
Let's not go
overboard with it,

06:12.778 --> 06:13.847
but let's put
spice on there.

06:13.847 --> 06:15.483
There has to be
a sauce on the dish.

06:15.483 --> 06:17.020
Lemon or lime,
chili butter,

06:17.020 --> 06:18.824
How about
a citrus beurre blanc
then for the fish?

06:18.824 --> 06:20.260
What were you saying
about the fish?

06:20.260 --> 06:22.030
I was thinking about
a nice little bit of
a citrus beurre blanc

06:22.030 --> 06:23.032
or something
to that effect.

06:23.032 --> 06:24.936
What about
a spicy mint sauce?

06:24.936 --> 06:27.374
F‐‐ for the fish?

06:27.374 --> 06:29.378
A simple white sauce
is sour cream,

06:29.378 --> 06:30.881
mayonnaise
and some lemon juice.

06:30.881 --> 06:32.350
I want to do
tarragon, too,

06:32.350 --> 06:33.887
'cause I know it's gonna
go well with the fish.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.023
There's a lot of ideas
going on at once.

06:35.023 --> 06:36.726
Everyone's throwing
things out,

06:36.726 --> 06:40.333
<i>but I think Jennifer</i>
<i>is having a hard time</i>
<i>understanding</i>

06:40.333 --> 06:42.304
that we need
to create a dish,

06:42.304 --> 06:44.542
not just a bunch
of ingredients.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.145
What is the consensus
on the potatoes?

06:46.145 --> 06:48.583
I want it, like, paprika.
I want some kind of,
like, smoky‐‐

06:48.583 --> 06:50.654
‐ I want heat.
‐ What about the other
vegetables?

06:50.654 --> 06:52.257
Are we gonna do eggplant?
Are we doing‐‐

06:52.257 --> 06:55.531
We want lots of color,
we want lots of fresh
for these people.

06:55.531 --> 06:58.770
She's a sweet person.
She's got a great palate.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.674
I want y'all on the slaw,
I want y'all on the fish,

07:00.674 --> 07:01.843
and let's roll it, okay?

07:01.843 --> 07:03.680
Okay.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.483
But if you're gonna
be a true leader,

07:05.483 --> 07:07.220
<i>you need to set</i>
<i>a vision.</i>

07:09.525 --> 07:12.030
Brien:
<i>Don't forget to salt and pepper</i>
<i>everything, you guys.</i>

07:12.030 --> 07:13.700
You guys got this.
Whoo!

07:13.700 --> 07:16.472
Christina:
101 lifeguards
out here on the beach?

07:16.472 --> 07:18.075
That's a tall order, guys.

07:18.075 --> 07:19.979
Aarón Sánchez:
Yeah, and you know,
we take for granted

07:19.979 --> 07:23.085
sometimes how much
experience we have
in serving large numbers,

07:23.085 --> 07:26.693
but these amateur
home cooks don't have
that DNA just yet.

07:26.693 --> 07:28.830
Gordon:
Yeah, the biggest point
of jeopardy today

07:28.830 --> 07:30.066
is that fish
doesn't hold.

07:30.066 --> 07:31.669
I mean, the bass
is not the kind of thing

07:31.669 --> 07:33.673
you can cook, store,
reheat and send,

07:33.673 --> 07:35.744
so they'll be cooking
fish to order.

07:35.744 --> 07:38.249
And this is just gonna be
a little bit of sauce, okay?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.521
And the sauce
is gonna be so integral

07:40.521 --> 07:42.424
for the success
of the blue team,

07:42.424 --> 07:44.629
'cause the rockfish doesn't
have that inherent flavor

07:44.629 --> 07:46.800
‐ that the striped bass does.
‐ Gordon: Exactly that.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.970
How do you feel about
mushrooms in my sauce?

07:48.970 --> 07:50.707
In your sauce?
I don't like it.

07:52.110 --> 07:53.412
‐ Brien?
‐ Yes, sir.

07:53.412 --> 07:54.982
These eggplant,
they're done.

07:54.982 --> 07:57.220
They're not crispy.
If we want 'em crispy,
we double‐fry 'em.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.090
‐ Let's double fry 'em.
‐ It's gonna take time,
though.

07:59.090 --> 08:01.195
‐ Brien: That's okay.
‐ Right, captain.
Come over here, please.

08:01.195 --> 08:02.765
‐ Yes, sir.
‐ It's our 30‐seconds
check in, let's go.

08:02.765 --> 08:05.336
‐ Describe the dish, please.
‐ A crispy‐skinned sea bass.

08:05.336 --> 08:08.710
‐ Right.
‐ We're going to then have
a bamboo rice with peas,

08:08.710 --> 08:10.012
crispy eggplant.

08:10.012 --> 08:12.852
We have a pineapple grilled
corn salad.

08:12.852 --> 08:15.122
Right, okay, so
you're cooking the bass
skin side down.

08:15.122 --> 08:16.358
‐ Brien: Correct.
‐ Gordon: Smart.

08:16.358 --> 08:17.862
Delegate,
divide and conquer.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.130
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Let's go.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.968
Thank you.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.538
‐ Christina: Jennifer.
‐ Jennifer: Yes!

08:22.538 --> 08:23.707
Okay, so you
have rockfish.

08:23.707 --> 08:25.109
What did you guys
come up with?

08:25.109 --> 08:27.948
We're doing the cast iron
skillets on the grill
for the fish.

08:27.948 --> 08:29.451
Talk to me
about the sides.

08:29.451 --> 08:31.789
Jennifer:
We are making
a broccoli rabe slaw.

08:31.789 --> 08:33.392
Yeah, that's gonna be
the fresh slaw that's
on the top,

08:33.392 --> 08:34.896
with a vegetable medley.

08:34.896 --> 08:37.668
We're doing kind of
a spicy, kind of savory,

08:37.668 --> 08:39.237
and then we have potatoes.

08:39.237 --> 08:41.576
Hoping it all
comes together, but right now,
I gotta make a sauce.

08:41.576 --> 08:42.912
‐ Okay.
‐ Jennifer: Sorry.

08:42.912 --> 08:44.447
‐ She's off, go!
‐ That's it.

08:44.447 --> 08:48.422
Jennifer seems
just a little frantic to me.

08:48.422 --> 08:50.326
‐ Aarón: Yeah.
‐ Maybe she knows
what she's serving,

08:50.326 --> 08:52.363
she's just not great
in the moment to tell us,

08:52.363 --> 08:55.002
but I'm a little
confused about what
the blue team's making.

08:57.140 --> 09:00.547
Guys, we open in just
under 25 minutes.

09:00.547 --> 09:01.583
All:
Yes, Chef.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.385
Okay, we got
the fish going.

09:03.385 --> 09:05.056
We're doing great,
doing great.

09:06.158 --> 09:07.828
Gordon:
Right, Newton,
how's the bass?

09:07.828 --> 09:09.397
‐ Newton: Done.
‐ What, 100 portions
are cooked?

09:09.397 --> 09:10.968
22 portions
are cooked, Chef.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.573
‐ Where is it?
‐ We got some
over there, Chef.

09:13.573 --> 09:15.611
‐ It's resting.
‐ Where?

09:15.611 --> 09:17.514
Right, right‐‐ right behind
where they're working.

09:17.514 --> 09:19.351
Gordon:
Oh, my God.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.321
Brien, so that's
gonna sit there now,

09:21.321 --> 09:23.025
‐ until we start serving.
‐ Right.

09:23.025 --> 09:24.194
Gordon:
Oh, man.

09:24.194 --> 09:26.666
We think we need
to get a bunch of fish done

09:26.666 --> 09:28.335
so that once
the rush hits us,

09:28.335 --> 09:29.705
we just have
enough to plate.

09:29.705 --> 09:32.544
But we cooked
too much fish too early.

09:32.544 --> 09:33.680
Gordon:
I give you the best fish,

09:33.680 --> 09:35.116
so you just cook it
like a banquet

09:35.116 --> 09:36.351
and stick it
under the table?

09:36.351 --> 09:38.222
It's not corned beef.

09:38.222 --> 09:40.292
Slow down
on the fish.

09:40.292 --> 09:42.330
Brien:
<i>I can feel our team</i>
<i>getting flustered.</i>

09:42.330 --> 09:43.399
Timing is everything,

09:43.399 --> 09:44.702
<i>and we royally</i>
<i>screwed up.</i>

09:44.702 --> 09:46.371
Your timing's ( bleep ).

09:54.387 --> 09:55.991
Gordon:
I've never seen
a bass cooked

09:55.991 --> 09:58.395
and then stuck
under the table
just to sit there.

09:58.395 --> 10:00.867
Necco, can you separate
the good ones and get rid
of the ( bleep ) ones?

10:00.867 --> 10:02.036
Necco:
Yes, Chef.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.439
Let's not do
that again, y'all.

10:03.439 --> 10:04.875
Gordon:
We can't just cook
100 pieces of bass

10:04.875 --> 10:06.244
and throw it out
like a banquet.

10:06.244 --> 10:07.614
Brien:
<i>I have no room for error.</i>

10:07.614 --> 10:09.885
We need to be super
methodical about this.

10:09.885 --> 10:12.725
<i>We can't let this fish</i>
<i>sit around and get cold.</i>

10:12.725 --> 10:14.461
We need to go
pan to plate.

10:14.461 --> 10:16.632
<i>It's the only way</i>
<i>to get these lifeguards fed.</i>

10:19.237 --> 10:21.108
Red team, blue team!

10:21.108 --> 10:23.479
Our lifeguards
are arriving!

10:23.479 --> 10:25.249
Guys, we got people
starting to come up.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.418
( cheers, applause )

10:26.418 --> 10:28.088
Aarón:
Man, look at 'em!

10:28.088 --> 10:30.594
Yachecia:
We're plating, we're plating,
we're plating!

10:30.594 --> 10:33.767
I look up and all of a sudden
there is this invasion

10:33.767 --> 10:36.104
<i>of lifeguards coming in,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking,</i>

10:36.104 --> 10:38.610
♪ Oh, my God. ♪

10:42.450 --> 10:44.287
Woman:
<i>Come on, guys, we got this.</i>

10:44.287 --> 10:45.657
It's game time, people.

10:45.657 --> 10:48.428
Jeff:
<i>There are lifeguards</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

10:48.428 --> 10:50.332
To my left, to my right.

10:50.332 --> 10:52.504
<i>Right now the tensions</i>
<i>are so high.</i>

10:52.504 --> 10:54.274
Coming around hot!
Coming around hot.

10:54.274 --> 10:55.677
Get out of my way, please.

10:55.677 --> 10:58.282
Fish at six o'clock, guys.
Fish at the six o'clock.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.854
Pay attention!
Don't fall apart now!

11:00.854 --> 11:02.591
Lifeguards,
a big thank you

11:02.591 --> 11:04.227
on behalf of Aarón,
Christina and I,

11:04.227 --> 11:05.630
for being such heroes.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.903
It's time to spoil you guys.
Are you hungry?

11:08.903 --> 11:10.607
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Gordon: Great.

11:10.607 --> 11:12.778
Please come around,
form a queue,

11:12.778 --> 11:14.815
pick up from the red team
and the blue team.

11:14.815 --> 11:16.418
Welcome.

11:16.418 --> 11:17.855
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Let's go, red team,
blue team!

11:17.855 --> 11:19.758
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

11:19.758 --> 11:22.263
I've been a lifeguard
here at Huntington
for 36 years,

11:22.263 --> 11:25.704
<i>and I know as well as</i>
<i>anybody that you work up</i>
<i>a big appetite</i>

11:25.704 --> 11:27.106
<i>surfing,</i>
<i>rescuing people.</i>

11:27.106 --> 11:28.610
<i>I'd like to see</i>
<i>something light</i>

11:28.610 --> 11:30.714
so that you don't
kind of get tired out
and worn down.

11:30.714 --> 11:33.185
I got three beautiful
plates ready to go.

11:33.185 --> 11:35.891
I've been a lifeguard
here at Huntington
for 14 years.

11:35.891 --> 11:39.130
<i>and I've never had a team</i>
<i>show up and cook me lunch</i>
<i>during duty,</i>

11:39.130 --> 11:41.669
so sitting on the beach
at a table is going
to be awesome.

11:41.669 --> 11:43.740
All right, guys,
here you go.

11:43.740 --> 11:44.842
Enjoy.

11:44.842 --> 11:46.646
Announcer:
<i>For today's challenge,</i>

Jennifer, what are
you doing now?

12:28.896 --> 12:30.834
Jennifer:
I am doing the fish,
and helping with the portions‐‐

12:30.834 --> 12:33.238
One, two, three, four,
five of you on the fish.

12:33.238 --> 12:34.775
Daniel:
That's way
too many, Chef.

12:34.775 --> 12:37.614
Somebody from
the fish line please
go out there and help.

12:37.614 --> 12:40.219
We need a bit
of a production line
going here, Jennifer.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.091
We're crossing over each other.
Let's go, get organized.

12:43.091 --> 12:46.532
Hey, fish
is going over here.
Fish staying here.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.903
Jennifer:
<i>I'm frustrated because</i>
<i>I'm trying to tell people</i>

12:48.903 --> 12:51.408
what I need them to do.
I'm having Gordon Ramsay

12:51.408 --> 12:53.646
in the back of my ear
just yelling at me.

12:53.646 --> 12:55.416
‐ Need more fish.
‐ Gordon: Where is the fish?

12:55.416 --> 12:58.121
‐ I'm getting the fish, sir.
‐ No, stay here!

12:58.121 --> 12:59.958
‐ Talk to the team!
‐ I need fish!

12:59.958 --> 13:01.695
‐ I need fish, please.
‐ Coming out.

13:01.695 --> 13:03.699
I'm about to go grab
one of those lifeguards

13:03.699 --> 13:04.868
and tell them
to come save me

13:04.868 --> 13:06.337
<i>'cause I'm drowning</i>
<i>in stress.</i>

13:06.337 --> 13:08.175
Gordon:
Somebody needs
to lead this team.

13:08.175 --> 13:09.912
‐ I got this,
I got the end.
‐ All right.

13:09.912 --> 13:11.916
I'll take care of the end.
I got the end.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.753
Jeff:
<i>Jennifer is way</i>
<i>over her head.</i>

13:13.753 --> 13:16.024
The blue team does not
have a voice right now.

13:16.024 --> 13:18.529
I gotta step up
and I'm gonna have
to be that voice.

13:18.529 --> 13:21.234
Let's go with
this assembly line
over here, people.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.539
Okay, boom, boom, boom.
Finish it up here.

13:23.539 --> 13:25.910
Quality control on me.
Heard?

13:25.910 --> 13:27.647
Can I get a "heard"
on the front line?

13:27.647 --> 13:29.417
‐ Woman: Yes!
‐ Heard!

13:29.417 --> 13:32.958
Announcer:
<i>While Jeff tries to keep</i>
<i>the blue team's service afloat,</i>

13:32.958 --> 13:37.767
<i>on the red team,</i>
<i>Captain Brien's quality control</i>
<i>is sinking.</i>

13:37.767 --> 13:39.103
What‐‐ what‐‐
what have they done?

13:39.103 --> 13:40.907
‐ It's not even cooked.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.145
We're gonna
double fry them now.

13:43.145 --> 13:44.781
<i>We don't want them</i>
<i>mushy like that.</i>

13:44.781 --> 13:46.151
This is just‐‐
they're not even cooked.

13:46.151 --> 13:47.153
Adam:
<i>The eggplant sucks.</i>

13:47.153 --> 13:48.421
I'm frying this eggplant

13:48.421 --> 13:50.459
the only way that I know how
to fry an eggplant,

13:50.459 --> 13:52.964
<i>and it's not working.</i>

13:52.964 --> 13:55.435
It's definitely mushier
than we wanted it, Chef.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.607
Cate:
Is this oil hot enough?
How do we turn it up?

13:57.607 --> 13:59.110
( bleep )
Now, can we not‐‐

13:59.110 --> 14:00.613
Where's the ( bleep )?
Out of the way, please?

14:00.613 --> 14:01.882
Where's the button?

14:01.882 --> 14:04.453
400's on there.
That's 200.

14:04.453 --> 14:06.559
So has that temperature
been down all that time?

14:06.559 --> 14:09.163
‐ That's why they're soggy.
‐ I wasn't on this station,
Chef.

14:09.163 --> 14:10.967
I'm guessing yes.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.739
The oil was cold.
What's that gonna do
to the eggplants?

14:13.739 --> 14:15.075
It's gonna just suck it
in like a sponge.

14:15.075 --> 14:17.279
So you're putting
this soggy crap
on the plate,

14:17.279 --> 14:19.685
and the gas is not
even up on the fryer.

14:19.685 --> 14:21.689
Jason:
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

14:21.689 --> 14:23.693
I know how
to cook eggplant at home

14:23.693 --> 14:25.095
but I've never used
a commercial fryer.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.497
Look at
the difference now.

14:26.497 --> 14:28.335
<i>With the oil hot,</i>
<i>we got some color on there.</i>

14:28.335 --> 14:29.337
Yes, Chef, thank you.

14:29.337 --> 14:30.974
Gordon:
Smarten up,

14:30.974 --> 14:33.679
and treat these dishes
as your best dishes
you've ever cooked!

14:33.679 --> 14:35.817

The fish is way too spicy.

<i>...Chef Aarón discovers</i>
<i>a problem</i>

14:44.166 --> 14:46.905
<i>with the blue team's</i>
<i>Cajun seasoning.</i>

14:46.905 --> 14:49.911
Too spicy.
But is the avocado
some relief or no?

14:49.911 --> 14:51.548
It's good together,
but if you just have

14:51.548 --> 14:52.984
the fish by itself,
it's too much.

14:52.984 --> 14:54.053
Aarón:
I got you.

14:54.053 --> 14:56.525
‐ Hey, Jennifer.
‐ Yes, what's going on?

14:56.525 --> 14:58.929
Have you tasted these
with this seasoning?

14:58.929 --> 15:00.600
That ( bleep ) is
spicy as hell.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.369
Jennifer:
Oh, damn.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.875
‐ Reba: Who seasoned these?
‐ I did.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.612
That's got a lot
of cayenne in it.

15:06.612 --> 15:09.016
Our fish just went
to hell in a hand basket.

15:09.016 --> 15:12.356
<i>Paige poured</i>
<i>a half a bottle of cayenne,</i>

15:12.356 --> 15:14.561
and just covered
the fish with cayenne.

15:14.561 --> 15:16.532
<i>I hope them lifeguards</i>
<i>like spice</i>

15:16.532 --> 15:18.903
'cause they just will
get a whole bundle of it.

15:18.903 --> 15:22.209
I thought the blue team
added too much spice
in the fish.

15:22.209 --> 15:26.885
It was almost where
I couldn't even taste
what it tasted like.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.723
Hey. Hey, blue team.

15:28.723 --> 15:30.258
Hey, hey!
Come here.

15:30.258 --> 15:32.396
Little Miss Daisy,
let's go, and you, Jeff.

15:32.396 --> 15:35.770
We're just over halfway,
and look what we're sending.

15:35.770 --> 15:38.576
Way too much seasoning.
Look at the spice.

15:38.576 --> 15:39.845
I'm gonna ask
you all a question,
is that good enough?

15:39.845 --> 15:41.214
All: No.

15:41.214 --> 15:43.284
‐ Gordon: Can you do better?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

15:43.284 --> 15:45.055
Gordon:
Then do it!

15:45.055 --> 15:47.092
Get a grip, guys.

15:47.092 --> 15:49.230
Dino:
<i>Paige and Jennifer</i>
<i>screwed up.</i>

15:49.230 --> 15:50.733
<i>If we don't fix</i>
<i>the fish right now,</i>

15:50.733 --> 15:53.939
we're literally gonna be
sleeping with these fishes.

15:53.939 --> 15:55.208
Jeff:
Seagulls like it.

16:03.324 --> 16:06.164
Does that look
like the same rockfish
that we started serving?

16:06.164 --> 16:08.502
‐ No, Chef. No, Chef.
‐ No, it does not.

16:08.502 --> 16:10.405
‐ No, sir.
‐ We're just over halfway,

16:10.405 --> 16:12.276
and look what
we're sending.

16:12.276 --> 16:13.746
Way too much seasoning.

16:13.746 --> 16:15.850
‐ Open your eyes, guys!
‐ Man: Yes, Chef.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.754
‐ You got standards, yes?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

16:17.754 --> 16:20.693
‐ Use them!
‐ Paige: The seasoning
was my bad,

16:20.693 --> 16:22.362
and I wish
I could take it back,

16:22.362 --> 16:23.899
but it's already
on the fish,

16:23.899 --> 16:25.368
<i>and the fish are</i>
<i>already on the grill.</i>

16:25.368 --> 16:28.709
I want you guys sorting
your ( bleep ) out
quickly.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.378
All right, guys.
We need to find
a middle ground

16:30.378 --> 16:31.748
on this spice, obviously.

16:31.748 --> 16:33.451
Daniel:
<i>This is a fish challenge.</i>

16:33.451 --> 16:35.055
<i>The fish needs</i>
<i>to shine,</i>

16:35.055 --> 16:37.594
and if the fish
isn't a home run,

16:37.594 --> 16:39.396
we're not gonna
win this battle.

16:39.396 --> 16:41.635
Danny, how many
do you think you can
repurpose there?

16:41.635 --> 16:42.770
Daniel:
Almost all of them.

16:42.770 --> 16:45.075
Just take the skin off,
serve it that side down.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.079
Yes, serve it with no skin.

16:47.079 --> 16:49.784
At least they've got fish
that's not blackened
and over‐seasoned.

16:49.784 --> 16:50.987
Thank you, Daniel.

16:50.987 --> 16:52.757
This team challenge
has been

16:52.757 --> 16:54.260
a complete emotional
roller coaster.

16:54.260 --> 16:55.530
It's gonna be okay, guys.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.132
Please stay
positive right now.

16:57.132 --> 16:58.936
I feel like we're
broken down so much,

16:58.936 --> 17:00.171
<i>the only way is up,</i>

17:00.171 --> 17:02.075
<i>so I feel like</i>
<i>with the help of Daniel</i>

17:02.075 --> 17:04.781
and Jeff, I'm hoping
we can still pull this off.

17:04.781 --> 17:06.384
I got 12 going
to the line.

17:06.384 --> 17:08.622
‐ Daniel: Perfect, perfect.
‐ 12 on the line.

17:08.622 --> 17:10.626
Announcer:
<i>While the blue team</i>
<i>scrambles</i>

17:10.626 --> 17:12.597
<i>to tamper the spice</i>
<i>on their rockfish,</i>

17:12.597 --> 17:16.505
<i>out in the dining area,</i>
<i>the competition is heating up.</i>

17:16.505 --> 17:18.509
Blue team.

17:18.509 --> 17:19.911
Red team.

17:19.911 --> 17:21.480
Gordon:
Red team, just under
20 plates to go.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.684
Brien:
20 plates to go.

17:22.684 --> 17:25.088
I think the overall taste
of the red team,

17:25.088 --> 17:28.161
just sweet and then salty,
went together a lot better

17:28.161 --> 17:29.531
than anything
from the blue team.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.467
‐ I'm digging the spice...
‐ Okay.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.338
...on the rockfish.
Oh, loving it.

17:33.338 --> 17:35.977
I like the avocado,
the salsa that they put
on top of it.

17:35.977 --> 17:38.214
Thank you so much for waiting.
Have a great day, okay?

17:38.214 --> 17:40.519
Jennifer:
Y'all doing great.
Everybody's doing great, okay?

17:40.519 --> 17:42.022
We're back on track.

17:42.022 --> 17:44.694
All those who are digging red,
raise your hands.

17:44.694 --> 17:46.063
All right, it's okay.

17:46.063 --> 17:48.401
Eboni.
Bass cooked beautifully.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.405
Crispy skin,
beautifully seasoned.

17:50.405 --> 17:54.881
Show of hands, who's going
for the red team here?

17:54.881 --> 17:57.252
Whoa!

17:57.252 --> 17:59.858
Show of hands, who's going
with the blue team?

17:59.858 --> 18:01.293
Man!

18:01.293 --> 18:02.964
This is getting
interesting, y'all.

18:02.964 --> 18:06.437
Red team, this
is your very last
lifeguard to serve.

18:06.437 --> 18:09.678
Make it nice.
He could be the difference
between you winning,

18:09.678 --> 18:10.880
and being
in the pressure test.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.215
Yachecia:
Make it beautiful!

18:12.215 --> 18:15.321
‐ All right.
Please enjoy.
‐ Enjoy.

18:15.321 --> 18:16.825
Thank you.

18:16.825 --> 18:20.331
Red team, blue team!
Service is over.

18:20.331 --> 18:22.503
Thank you!
All right, guys,
we did it!

18:22.503 --> 18:24.841
We did it, guys.
We did it!

18:24.841 --> 18:26.978
‐ Good job, guys, good job.
‐ Nice job, nice job,
team blue.

18:26.978 --> 18:29.049
Daniel:
<i>The blue team had</i>
<i>a real tough start.</i>

18:29.049 --> 18:31.220
It would have been easy
for us to just fall apart

18:31.220 --> 18:32.657
and give up,
but we didn't.

18:32.657 --> 18:35.195
<i>We stayed determined,</i>
<i>and we definitely started</i>

18:35.195 --> 18:37.032
<i>pumping out</i>
<i>high‐quality food,</i>

18:37.032 --> 18:39.738
<i>so I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>that we might have done enough</i>
<i>to take this home.</i>

18:39.738 --> 18:42.944
All:
One, two, three.
Lifeguards!

18:42.944 --> 18:44.079
( cheering )

18:44.079 --> 18:45.215
Thank you!

18:45.215 --> 18:46.718
Necco:
<i>What an amazing experience.</i>

18:46.718 --> 18:50.091
None of us have ever done
anything like this before.

18:50.091 --> 18:52.028
<i>Overall, I'm feeling</i>
<i>pretty good.</i>

18:52.028 --> 18:54.066
But who knows who's going
to win this challenge?

18:54.066 --> 18:56.638
It's up to the lifeguards
to make that decision.

18:58.407 --> 19:00.546
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for giving us

19:00.546 --> 19:02.817
an opportunity
to say thank you to you all

19:02.817 --> 19:04.921
for keeping
these beaches safe.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.423
Did you enjoy lunch?

19:06.423 --> 19:08.996
( cheers, applause )

19:08.996 --> 19:10.498
We're glad
to hear it, thank you.

19:10.498 --> 19:13.906
But we can only have
one winning team,

19:13.906 --> 19:15.910
and that
is in your hands.

19:15.910 --> 19:18.214
I'm gonna ask
all 101 of you

19:18.214 --> 19:22.690
to run to either the red flag
or the blue flag.

19:22.690 --> 19:25.228
‐ Are you ready?
‐ ( cheers, applause )

19:25.228 --> 19:28.067
Three, two, one, go!

19:28.067 --> 19:30.271
Woman:
Red team!

19:32.409 --> 19:35.415
( cheers, applause )

19:42.329 --> 19:44.767
It looks like
the winning team is...

19:48.441 --> 19:50.178
...the red team!
Well done!

19:50.178 --> 19:52.182
( all cheering )

19:58.962 --> 20:00.532
I am...

20:00.532 --> 20:02.002
so relieved!

20:02.002 --> 20:04.006
<i>We don't have to go</i>
<i>through the pressure test.</i>

20:04.006 --> 20:06.176
People loved our dish.

20:06.176 --> 20:08.114
Yeah!

20:08.114 --> 20:10.018
Congratulations, red team.
Well done.

20:10.018 --> 20:13.825
‐ Thank you guys!
‐ Yeah! Thanks so much!

20:13.825 --> 20:16.798
All right, blue team,
you know what this means.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.467
A pressure test,

20:18.467 --> 20:20.572
where you will
be facing elimination.

20:20.572 --> 20:23.311
We'll see you back
in the MasterChef kitchen.

20:23.311 --> 20:24.914
All:
Yes, Chef.

20:24.914 --> 20:26.083
Jeff:
<i>I'm pissed right now.</i>

20:26.083 --> 20:28.087
I know I gave 110%.

20:28.087 --> 20:30.425
<i>It's not my fault we lost.</i>

20:30.425 --> 20:31.828
<i>That fish was spicy.</i>

20:31.828 --> 20:34.834
<i>Our leadership</i>
<i>was never, ever there.</i>

20:34.834 --> 20:36.571
I could be going home

20:36.571 --> 20:38.608
because of the mistakes
of someone else on my team.

20:38.608 --> 20:40.946
Reba:
The fish‐‐ the cayenne
was way, way‐‐

20:40.946 --> 20:42.717
It was way too spicy.

20:42.717 --> 20:44.620
The spice was my fault.
Sorry, guys.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.923
When it comes down to it,

20:45.923 --> 20:48.795
we lost and somebody here
is going home tomorrow.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.163
Gordon:
Welcome, guys.

21:06.163 --> 21:08.200
Come on in, line up.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.436
Jennifer:
<i>Walking into</i>
<i>the pressure test,</i>

21:09.436 --> 21:10.706
I feel like
I've let my team down,

21:10.706 --> 21:12.242
I've let myself down.

21:12.242 --> 21:15.549
<i>I shouldn't have jumped in</i>
<i>and tried to help everybody.</i>

21:15.549 --> 21:17.953
<i>I needed</i>
<i>to delegate more.</i>

21:17.953 --> 21:20.091
Now my head
and my negative thoughts

21:20.091 --> 21:21.393
are getting
the best of me.

21:21.393 --> 21:23.899
<i>I gotta</i>
<i>pull it together.</i>

21:23.899 --> 21:25.401
Yesterday,
that was your first

21:25.401 --> 21:27.472
MasterChef
team challenge.

21:27.472 --> 21:30.378
Red team, the lifeguards
preferred your dish

21:30.378 --> 21:33.552
and that's why
you're up there
safe on the balcony.

21:33.552 --> 21:36.658
There are nine of you
standing in front of us,

21:36.658 --> 21:40.164
but not all of you
are gonna have to face

21:40.164 --> 21:43.003
this dreaded pressure test.

21:43.003 --> 21:44.439
Christina:
Based on your performances,

21:44.439 --> 21:46.744
each one of us
is going to spare

21:46.744 --> 21:49.182
one of you
from elimination.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.155
Gordon,
let's start with you.

21:52.155 --> 21:54.961
This individual
was consistent,

21:54.961 --> 21:58.200
across the whole
75 minutes.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.338
The person
that I'm saving...

22:01.975 --> 22:03.277
...is Jeff.

22:03.277 --> 22:04.981
Thank you, Chef.

22:04.981 --> 22:07.485
‐ Christina: Aarón.
‐ This individual

22:07.485 --> 22:11.260
was in charge of a very
important aspect of the dish.

22:11.260 --> 22:12.730
Daniel.

22:12.730 --> 22:15.969
Christina:
There was one home cook
that, for me,

22:15.969 --> 22:17.740
wasn't afraid
to give feedback

22:17.740 --> 22:20.144
but also wasn't afraid
to take the lead.

22:20.144 --> 22:21.480
Reba.

22:23.985 --> 22:25.989
Guys, up to the balcony.

22:25.989 --> 22:28.628
Reba:
<i>It is a shock</i>
<i>to hear my name called,</i>

22:28.628 --> 22:30.766
but I'm gonna mosey
right on up there.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.503
<i>Being up on the balcony,</i>

22:32.503 --> 22:34.874
it's like being at church
and in the choir...

22:34.874 --> 22:36.778
♪ Aah. ♪

22:36.778 --> 22:38.615
<i>It's a blessing.</i>

22:38.615 --> 22:40.719
Are you ready to find out what
you're gonna have to master

22:40.719 --> 22:43.825
‐ to stay in
this competition?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

22:45.796 --> 22:47.365
You're gonna have
to make my version

22:47.365 --> 22:49.002
of a hearty
American comfort food.

22:50.672 --> 22:53.845
Tonight, you'll be recreating
my grilled pork chop dish,

22:53.845 --> 22:55.248
with grilled
nopales picadillo

22:55.248 --> 22:56.918
and a prickly pear
sauce.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.590
But can anyone guess
the star ingredient

22:59.590 --> 23:01.360
of this gorgeous
green picadillo

23:01.360 --> 23:03.665
and amazing
jewel‐colored sauce?

23:06.103 --> 23:09.142
It started out
like this.

23:09.142 --> 23:10.712
The humble <i>nopal.</i>

23:10.712 --> 23:13.017
That means cactus
and prickly pear plant.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.987
Pay close attention, guys.

23:14.987 --> 23:18.828
I'm gonna show you
how to prepare cactus
for cooking.

23:18.828 --> 23:22.235
Those cactus spikes
need to be removed
very carefully.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.740
First of all,
start with the end.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.476
It's tough
and kind of fibrous.

23:26.476 --> 23:28.581
Then, at a very
close angle, guys,

23:28.581 --> 23:31.688
remove the outside
of it, okay?

23:31.688 --> 23:34.092
Now that we have a nice,
clean area to work with,

23:34.092 --> 23:36.831
I'm just gonna run
my paring knife

23:36.831 --> 23:39.035
down the paddle.

23:39.035 --> 23:41.941
The real test:
run your finger down it.

23:41.941 --> 23:44.513
I'm not getting
stung with one of those
little needles or anything.

23:44.513 --> 23:46.283
Same thing.
Flip it over.

23:46.283 --> 23:49.757
Repeat the process
on the other side.

23:49.757 --> 23:51.059
Beautiful.

23:51.059 --> 23:52.696
This is not only just
a prized part of the cactus,

23:52.696 --> 23:55.802
it also has
a really beautiful fruit.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.405
This is called,
in Mexico, "tuna,"

23:57.405 --> 24:00.144
and I'm gonna
show you why.

24:00.144 --> 24:03.985
It mimics the flesh
of a beautiful blue fin tuna.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.689
It has that vibrant
crimson color.

24:05.689 --> 24:06.924
Gorgeous.

24:06.924 --> 24:10.197
That somehow has to get
transformed into that.

24:10.197 --> 24:12.101
But before
you can replicate it,

24:12.101 --> 24:14.038
‐ you have to taste it.
‐ Yes!

24:14.038 --> 24:15.441
Come on up.

24:17.378 --> 24:19.048
All right, guys,
get in there.

24:19.048 --> 24:20.952
What kind
of cheese is this?

24:20.952 --> 24:21.954
Cotija.

24:22.956 --> 24:24.960
Being half Mexican,
I grew up making

24:24.960 --> 24:28.434
pico de gallo, enchiladas,
the works.

24:28.434 --> 24:30.471
Everyone, please,
back to your stations.

24:30.471 --> 24:33.778
So I'm familiar
with the spices and flavors

24:33.778 --> 24:35.281
<i>that Aarón has</i>
<i>used in this dish,</i>

24:35.281 --> 24:37.820
<i>It shouldn't be</i>
<i>too hard.</i>

24:37.820 --> 24:40.458
Now, at your station
you'll find everything
you need.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.629
Gordon:
You'll have 45 minutes

24:42.629 --> 24:46.737
to flawlessly replicate
Aarón's stunning dish.

24:46.737 --> 24:48.575
Is everybody ready?

24:48.575 --> 24:50.144
All:
Yes, Chef.

24:50.144 --> 24:51.814
Your 45 minutes...

24:51.814 --> 24:53.250
starts...

24:53.250 --> 24:54.452
now.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.122
( cheers, applause )

24:56.122 --> 24:57.124
Man:
Come on, people.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.201
Gabriel:
<i>I am a little worried.</i>

25:02.201 --> 25:04.105
<i>I do work at a Mexican</i>
<i>fast food restaurant</i>

25:04.105 --> 25:06.076
<i>but these are not ingredients</i>
<i>that I'm very familiar with,</i>
<i>working.</i>

25:06.076 --> 25:08.146
The nopales aren't something
that I'm used to working with.

25:08.146 --> 25:10.084
The cactus fruit,
it's not in my comfort zone,

25:10.084 --> 25:11.621
It's not something
I'm used to doing.

25:11.621 --> 25:13.290
So it very well could be
me going home today.

25:13.290 --> 25:14.660
Oh, boy.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.564
I'm feeling a lot
of pressure right now.

25:16.564 --> 25:18.100
I'm just trying to get
to know these ingredients

25:18.100 --> 25:19.670
because I'm not
familiar at all.

25:19.670 --> 25:21.507
I'm not cooking
a lot of Mexican cuisine

25:21.507 --> 25:23.410
out in Cincinnati, Ohio.

25:23.410 --> 25:25.481
But I'm gonna go ahead
and do my best,

25:25.481 --> 25:29.289
and leave the rest
up to the judges.

25:29.289 --> 25:32.529
This is a very daunting task,
to execute that stunning
pork dish.

25:32.529 --> 25:34.098
What is the real jeopardy?

25:34.098 --> 25:35.334
Aarón:
I think for me
it's the paddles.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.637
The way I would
handle this,

25:36.637 --> 25:38.641
clean them properly
like I showed them,

25:38.641 --> 25:41.446
then slice,
then marinate them quickly

25:41.446 --> 25:43.651
in some lime juice, olive oil,
salt and pepper,

25:43.651 --> 25:45.120
and put that on the grill.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.489
Now what about the sauce?

25:46.489 --> 25:48.160
I feel like that could be
a point of jeopardy as well.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.497
Aarón:
The cactus pear teeters
on being cloyingly sweet,

25:50.497 --> 25:52.903
so you have to add
just the right amount,

25:52.903 --> 25:55.474
cook your shallots
and your garlic slowly,

25:55.474 --> 25:57.011
then add the cactus pear

25:57.011 --> 25:59.583
flambé, and then purée.

25:59.583 --> 26:02.455
The hero is
not just the cactus
but the pork as well.

26:02.455 --> 26:03.925
Aarón:
I season mine simply

26:03.925 --> 26:06.964
with a little bit of coriander,
some chili powder and salt.

26:06.964 --> 26:09.135
Gordon:
For me tonight, this is all
about who's got the hunger...

26:09.135 --> 26:11.272
Oh, baby doll! Oww!

26:11.272 --> 26:13.611
...and who deserves
to stay in this competition.

26:15.447 --> 26:17.552
Christina:
30 minutes to go, guys.

26:19.556 --> 26:21.459
‐ All right, Dino.
‐ How you doing, Chef?

26:21.459 --> 26:22.896
‐ How's it going?
‐ Being a vegan,

26:22.896 --> 26:24.198
I'm confident
with at least the veggies.

26:24.198 --> 26:25.568
I got the flavors
on point.

26:25.568 --> 26:27.739
Cactus flowers
and prickly pears

26:27.739 --> 26:29.142
don't really grow
in Brooklyn.

26:29.142 --> 26:31.514
‐ Oh, no.
‐ Not so much, right?

26:31.514 --> 26:32.849
What's your thought
process?

26:32.849 --> 26:34.520
Strictly taste.
Everything that I tasted.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.922
Okay, and talk me
through that.

26:35.922 --> 26:37.993
Well, everything
was individually cooked.

26:37.993 --> 26:39.730
<i>I could tell 'cause</i>
<i>everything had its own taste.</i>

26:39.730 --> 26:41.066
It's not like it was
all thrown together.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.170
How much time you gonna give
yourself for that pork chop?

26:43.170 --> 26:45.174
Gonna throw it on last minute.
I know how to do that.

26:45.174 --> 26:46.911
Okay.
Someone is going home.

26:46.911 --> 26:48.380
Make sure
it's not you, sir.

26:48.380 --> 26:50.451
Yeah, Chef, you got it.
I'll be here.

26:50.451 --> 26:52.421
Right, Paige,
did you have a taste
of the dish?

26:52.421 --> 26:54.893
Yes, I'm confident
that I can replicate it.

26:54.893 --> 26:58.133
I'm half‐Mexican,
so I'm pretty familiar
with Mexican flavors.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.137
Right. Being the youngest
in this competition,

27:00.137 --> 27:01.774
do you still think,
at the age of 18,

27:01.774 --> 27:03.578
you can become
America's next MasterChef?

27:03.578 --> 27:05.013
I think I definitely can.

27:05.013 --> 27:07.719
I may be one
of the youngest competitors
in this competition,

27:07.719 --> 27:10.491
but I'm always known
to set my mind
to do things

27:10.491 --> 27:11.493
and I always do them.

27:11.493 --> 27:13.698
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.367
You got this, guys.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.004
Caitlin, how are
you feeling?

27:17.004 --> 27:18.340
Caitlin:
I'm doing well

27:18.340 --> 27:20.244
but growing in Pittsburgh,
these are not ingredients

27:20.244 --> 27:22.381
that we would work with
on a regular basis,

27:22.381 --> 27:24.385
largely the cactus
and the prickly pear.

27:24.385 --> 27:27.191
‐ Aarón: Cool.
‐ It's a totally
different experience.

27:27.191 --> 27:30.799
to make a dish that you saw
and tasted literally one time.

27:30.799 --> 27:32.736
Make sure you work
on your presentation.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.706
‐ Yes.
‐ The cooking
of the pork chop.

27:34.706 --> 27:36.610
‐ All right, good luck.
‐ Thank you.

27:39.215 --> 27:42.388
Just under
15 minutes remaining.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.762
Whoo!

27:45.762 --> 27:49.636
Oh, ( bleep ) flustered.
Oh, ( bleep ).

27:51.105 --> 27:52.642
‐ Oh, boy.
‐ What?

27:52.642 --> 27:55.414
Jennifer is in trouble.

27:55.414 --> 27:59.288
Jennifer's been in her head
since the team challenge.

27:59.288 --> 28:00.992
( bleep )

28:00.992 --> 28:04.031
She's flustered.
She's about to lose it.

28:04.031 --> 28:05.067
( bleep )

28:05.067 --> 28:07.104
Oh, my God.

28:07.104 --> 28:09.576
Jennifer:
<i>I'm definitely</i>
<i>scared right now.</i>

28:09.576 --> 28:13.450
I'm working with a cactus
and I'm working with some sort
of other cactus.

28:13.450 --> 28:14.953
Help me, Lord.

28:14.953 --> 28:17.424
I'm working with these things
I've never worked with before

28:17.424 --> 28:18.995
<i>and I'm out</i>
<i>of my comfort zone.</i>

28:18.995 --> 28:20.598
<i>I'm trying my best</i>
<i>to hold it together</i>

28:20.598 --> 28:22.602
<i>but my insides</i>
<i>are screaming.</i>

28:22.602 --> 28:23.804
Look at Jennifer.

28:23.804 --> 28:25.073
Aarón:
Oh, my God, she's crying.

28:25.073 --> 28:26.610
Gordon:
Oh wow, is she okay?

28:26.610 --> 28:28.848
Christina:
I'm worried she's
gonna crumble, Gordon.

28:38.199 --> 28:40.370
Oh, ( bleep ) flustered.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.976
‐ Look at Jennifer.
‐ Aarón: Oh, my God,
she's crying.

28:42.976 --> 28:45.480
Christina:
I'm worried she's
gonna crumble, Gordon.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.318
Right, first of all,
let me just tell
you something.

28:47.318 --> 28:49.055
You've had
a couple of setbacks.

28:49.055 --> 28:51.025
Would you like to know
how many setbacks
I've had in life?

28:51.025 --> 28:53.396
The more mistakes you make,
the better you become,

28:53.396 --> 28:55.735
so don't let that
get to you, okay?

28:55.735 --> 28:57.004
That challenge is gone.

28:57.004 --> 28:58.073
Now you need
to stay focused

28:58.073 --> 29:00.878
on what this task
has in hand.

29:00.878 --> 29:03.818
Now this passion
and determination
and this hunger

29:03.818 --> 29:05.354
for this competition,
where does that come from?

29:05.354 --> 29:06.924
I just want
to change my life.

29:06.924 --> 29:08.928
‐ This is real for you.
‐ This is the realest thing,

29:08.928 --> 29:10.130
that maybe I've
ever done in my life

29:10.130 --> 29:12.334
except for marrying
my husband.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.338
I see that passion.
I can feel it.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.175
‐ Bounce back.
‐ I'm trying.

29:16.175 --> 29:17.712
I promise to do
the best that I can.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.883
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.

29:21.185 --> 29:22.856
I'm worried,
I'm worried.

29:22.856 --> 29:23.891
Gordon:
Wow, the level
of seriousness

29:23.891 --> 29:25.528
on their faces
is extraordinary.

29:25.528 --> 29:26.864
Christina, who are
you most worried about?

29:26.864 --> 29:28.299
I'm worried about Gabriel.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.838
Gabriel is a little bit
more timid

29:30.838 --> 29:32.742
about working with these
unfamiliar ingredients.

29:32.742 --> 29:34.846
He's gotta mind‐over‐matter
the situation

29:34.846 --> 29:37.151
if he's gonna make it
out of here alive.

29:37.151 --> 29:40.057
Aarón:
Paige seems to just be
really all over the place.

29:40.057 --> 29:41.693
That sauce
with the cactus pear

29:41.693 --> 29:43.229
looks very slimy and runny.

29:43.229 --> 29:47.204
Gordon:
We are coming down
to the last 60 seconds.

29:47.204 --> 29:49.876
( contestants cheering )

29:49.876 --> 29:51.245
( applause )

29:51.245 --> 29:52.882
Christina:
Come on, guys.

29:52.882 --> 29:54.753
One of you is
going home tonight.

29:54.753 --> 29:57.124
Make sure it's not you.

29:57.124 --> 29:58.594
Gordon:
Let's go!
Ten...

29:58.594 --> 30:01.900
Judges:
Nine, eight, seven,

30:01.900 --> 30:04.906
six, five, four

30:04.906 --> 30:07.912
three, two, one!

30:07.912 --> 30:09.749
Gordon:
Stop! Hands in the air!

30:09.749 --> 30:11.820
( cheers, applause )

30:11.820 --> 30:16.830
You six are all in a fight
for survival tonight.

30:16.830 --> 30:18.466
First up...

30:19.636 --> 30:20.738
Jennifer.

30:20.738 --> 30:22.609
‐ ( applause )
‐ Woman: All right, Jen.

30:22.609 --> 30:24.011
I am a debt collector
and I deal

30:24.011 --> 30:25.313
with really stressful
situations,

30:25.313 --> 30:27.017
<i>but being</i>
<i>in this pressure test</i>

30:27.017 --> 30:29.255
<i>was really hard</i>
<i>for me today.</i>

30:29.255 --> 30:30.758
I lost my cool
during the cook

30:30.758 --> 30:32.361
but I feel like it doesn't
reflect on my plate.

30:32.361 --> 30:34.031
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I pulled it together,</i>

30:34.031 --> 30:37.337
<i>and elevated it</i>
<i>the best way that I could.</i>

30:37.337 --> 30:38.473
Gordon:
Young lady, first of all,

30:38.473 --> 30:41.445
previous challenge,
you captained your blue team

30:41.445 --> 30:44.218
to that miserable loss.

30:44.218 --> 30:46.723
Is this redemption?
Have you come back strong?

30:46.723 --> 30:48.326
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Right.

30:48.326 --> 30:49.529
Let's get in there,
shall we?

30:54.806 --> 30:56.209
It's undercooked.

31:00.083 --> 31:02.154
All we need
is a mud bath,

31:02.154 --> 31:05.695
and that thing can go
back in the field.

31:05.695 --> 31:07.532
You're right.

31:11.873 --> 31:13.376
The pork
is undercooked.

31:13.376 --> 31:16.315
The actual cactus,
the seasoning,

31:16.315 --> 31:17.451
you actually nailed.

31:17.451 --> 31:18.520
The sauce,
you got that balance

31:18.520 --> 31:21.058
between the heat
and the acidity.

31:21.058 --> 31:23.530
Here's what frustrates
me about you.

31:23.530 --> 31:25.568
You get a little
knocked back,

31:25.568 --> 31:27.905
and you sort of
disintegrate.

31:27.905 --> 31:31.078
And I think that you may have
one foot out the door.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.353
( applause )

31:35.353 --> 31:37.558
Chin up.

31:37.558 --> 31:39.228
Next up, please.
Gabriel.

31:39.228 --> 31:40.765
( applause )

31:40.765 --> 31:43.604
Trying to replicate
Chef Aarón's dish
is very technical.

31:43.604 --> 31:45.675
<i>I really wanted to prove</i>
<i>to the judges I've got</i>
<i>the confidence,</i>

31:45.675 --> 31:48.112
<i>I've got the skill</i>
<i>to still be in this kitchen,</i>

31:48.112 --> 31:50.751
<i>and I'm really hoping</i>
<i>that my pork is cooked,</i>

31:50.751 --> 31:53.089
because if it's not,
I could be going home.

31:53.089 --> 31:55.628
How did those last
45 minutes go for you?

31:55.628 --> 31:57.765
Uh, it was a little rough.
It was a little out of
my comfort zone,

31:57.765 --> 31:59.368
so I was trying
to keep my head on straight

31:59.368 --> 32:01.606
and really focus
on what I was doing.

32:07.919 --> 32:10.490
‐ It's perfect.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

32:10.490 --> 32:11.727
It's beautiful white.
You can still see

32:11.727 --> 32:13.997
those glistening juices
there in the middle.

32:13.997 --> 32:16.268
How often do you cook
pork chops at home?

32:16.268 --> 32:19.341
Very rarely, Chef,
'cause I'm a pescatarian.

32:19.341 --> 32:21.947
This chop, you got
the flavor spot on.

32:21.947 --> 32:24.586
The cactus paddle,
that picadillo

32:24.586 --> 32:26.523
it's delicious,
and it's clear

32:26.523 --> 32:27.792
that you have
the knife skills.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.428
It's very impressive.

32:29.428 --> 32:32.067
Prickly pear sauce,
it's a little slimy.

32:32.067 --> 32:34.138
Would have liked to see that
worked a little less.

32:34.138 --> 32:36.242
Overall, nice job.

32:36.242 --> 32:39.281
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

32:43.089 --> 32:45.427
Please step forward,
Caitlin.

32:45.427 --> 32:47.264
( applause )

32:47.264 --> 32:49.268
Caitlin:
<i>Everything is on the line</i>
<i>with this dish.</i>

32:49.268 --> 32:53.610
<i>Replicating a dish</i>
<i>by an acclaimed chef</i>
<i>like Aarón Sánchez</i>

32:53.610 --> 32:56.616
requires a lot of different
skills from a cook.

32:56.616 --> 32:59.321
<i>I just hope my dish matches up</i>
<i>to their expectations.</i>

32:59.321 --> 33:00.991
Aarón:
Miss Caitlin,

33:00.991 --> 33:03.630
you deciphered the flavors
of what I did for you,

33:03.630 --> 33:06.135
and said that, "You know what?
That sauce had this," right?

33:06.135 --> 33:07.872
Caitlin:
I had a little difficulty

33:07.872 --> 33:10.210
figuring out exactly what
flavors were in the food

33:10.210 --> 33:11.479
just from my tongue,

33:11.479 --> 33:13.282
but when I got back
to my station

33:13.282 --> 33:15.153
and saw the spices
that were there,

33:15.153 --> 33:18.092
I did my best to sort of
mix and match tastes.

33:19.328 --> 33:20.965
That pork chop's
a little bit under.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.572
But, you put the right
amount of spices.

33:24.572 --> 33:26.075
The chili powder's
coming through.

33:26.075 --> 33:27.645
The coriander's
very subtle.

33:27.645 --> 33:29.448
I love the way
you treated the cactus.

33:29.448 --> 33:31.786
Cooked through,
not slimy.

33:31.786 --> 33:35.594
The sauce, I think you cooked
it down a wee bit too much,

33:35.594 --> 33:37.532
but I think it does
have that vibrancy.

33:37.532 --> 33:38.834
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.840
( applause )

33:43.442 --> 33:45.380
Next up, Dino.
Let's go, please.

33:45.380 --> 33:48.119
Dino:
<i>I've known how to cook pork</i>
<i>for a very long time,</i>

33:48.119 --> 33:50.958
and even being vegan,
you know, it's muscle memory.

33:50.958 --> 33:52.562
I'm never gonna forget
how to make it.

33:52.562 --> 33:55.400
<i>But still, I'm sweating</i>
<i>a little and I'm thinking</i>

33:55.400 --> 33:57.738
<i>"Oh, did you leave that</i>
<i>in there long enough?"</i>

33:57.738 --> 34:01.513
I'm really hoping my pig still
ain't splashing in the mud.

34:01.513 --> 34:04.151
Is the pork chop
cooked?

34:04.151 --> 34:05.688
I believe
the pork chop's cooked.

34:05.688 --> 34:08.961
I grilled it on each side
and then I threw it
in the oven.

34:08.961 --> 34:12.535
Total cook time
was about 12, 13 minutes.

34:15.373 --> 34:16.876
Oh, my God.

34:20.483 --> 34:23.022
It's cooked beautifully,
all the way through.

34:23.022 --> 34:25.527
‐ ( exhales )
‐ What's the seasoning
on the pork?

34:25.527 --> 34:27.698
Dino: Salt, pepper
and a pinch of coriander.

34:27.698 --> 34:30.036
And the cactus,
what's in there?

34:30.036 --> 34:31.640
Dino:
I roasted the corn first
on the grill,

34:31.640 --> 34:33.910
I cooked
the nopales separately.

34:33.910 --> 34:35.346
Gordon:
It's delicious.

34:35.346 --> 34:37.818
Seasoning's on point,
pork's cooked beautifully.

34:37.818 --> 34:40.323
Knife cuts need
a little bit of help.

34:40.323 --> 34:42.728
‐ But great job.
Thank you.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

34:42.728 --> 34:45.266
( cheers, applause )

34:45.266 --> 34:47.404
‐ Man: Great job, Dino.
‐ You rock, Dino.

34:48.874 --> 34:50.544
Aarón:
All right, so the next
home cook's dish

34:50.544 --> 34:52.748
that we'd like to taste
is Jenny.

34:52.748 --> 34:54.752
‐ ( applause )
‐ Jenny: <i>This is</i>
<i>the hardest thing</i>

34:54.752 --> 34:56.790
<i>that I've done</i>
<i>in this competition so far.</i>

34:56.790 --> 34:58.894
I just really hope
that they see how much care

34:58.894 --> 35:01.098
I put into replicating
each one of these elements,

35:01.098 --> 35:03.537
<i>but I am very concerned</i>
<i>that this dish could</i>
<i>send me home.</i>

35:05.206 --> 35:06.676
Aarón:
Jenny, did you cook this

35:06.676 --> 35:08.345
or did you decide
to serve it raw

35:08.345 --> 35:10.551
or seasoned like a salad?

35:10.551 --> 35:11.820
Jenny:
I cooked it.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.690
I roasted
the poblano peppers,

35:13.690 --> 35:15.193
I charred
the red peppers,

35:15.193 --> 35:16.863
I grilled the corn,

35:16.863 --> 35:19.702
I got some color
on the chorizo,

35:19.702 --> 35:21.573
and the cactus leaf.

35:21.573 --> 35:24.377
Aarón:
The seasoning
on the chop, great.

35:24.377 --> 35:25.714
The sauce is good.

35:25.714 --> 35:27.417
I think you could have
thinned it out

35:27.417 --> 35:29.555
maybe flambéed
with more tequila.

35:29.555 --> 35:31.425
You should have put
a lot more cactus
in there.

35:31.425 --> 35:33.730
I think you went
heavy‐handed with the corn.

35:33.730 --> 35:35.567
But not bad.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.303
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Good job, Jenny.

35:39.141 --> 35:42.648
The next home cook
whose dish we'd like
to taste, Paige.

35:42.648 --> 35:44.251
( applause )

35:44.251 --> 35:46.589
I'm feeling pretty good
about my dish.

35:46.589 --> 35:50.429
<i>I replicated this dish as</i>
<i>closely to Aarón's as I could.</i>

35:50.429 --> 35:52.400
<i>I'm confident,</i>
<i>I'm excited.</i>

35:52.400 --> 35:54.137
<i>I am super pumped.</i>

35:54.137 --> 35:55.507
All right, Miss Paige.

35:55.507 --> 35:56.843
How do you think
it went for you?

35:56.843 --> 35:59.247
I think I really,
really nailed it.

36:03.189 --> 36:05.694
You can see that
right there, right?

36:05.694 --> 36:09.936
‐ Just that stark
white fat, unrendered.
‐ Definitely.

36:09.936 --> 36:12.608
You're almost
a little too smiley for me
for this pressure test.

36:12.608 --> 36:15.379
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ I mean, I'm looking
at this crosshatch.

36:15.379 --> 36:17.718
This kind of
just looks messy.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.487
It looks like you've moved
the pork chop around

36:19.487 --> 36:20.958
three or four
different times.

36:20.958 --> 36:23.229
Cooking a pork chop
seems easy to me,

36:23.229 --> 36:25.066
so I was really focusing
on the pico de gallo,

36:25.066 --> 36:26.501
because that had
more elements.

36:26.501 --> 36:28.607
All right,
let's take a look.

36:28.607 --> 36:30.276
What do you think?

36:30.276 --> 36:33.182
I think it's
definitely undercooked.

36:33.182 --> 36:35.186
I would not want
to eat it.

36:40.096 --> 36:41.699
Christina:
Your nopales picadillo,

36:41.699 --> 36:44.037
I am surprised
at the flavor.

36:44.037 --> 36:45.607
There's an elegance
to it,

36:45.607 --> 36:48.212
but for me,
your pork chop's bland.

36:48.212 --> 36:49.882
It's undercooked.

36:49.882 --> 36:51.719
Sauce, definitely
over‐reduced.

36:51.719 --> 36:52.888
Just sloppy,
it's messy.

36:52.888 --> 36:56.194
It's almost like
you just don't care anymore.

36:56.194 --> 36:59.669
I definitely care.
I guess I have too much
confidence in my abilities

36:59.669 --> 37:03.843
and I wasn't focusing
on the part that I thought
would be easy.

37:03.843 --> 37:05.814
I'm just not buying it.

37:05.814 --> 37:07.250
Thank you, Chef.

37:09.522 --> 37:11.358
Paige:
<i>I'm feeling embarrassed</i>
<i>right now.</i>

37:11.358 --> 37:15.634
but my pork was still edible,
even though it was undercooked.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.172
<i>I'm just really hoping</i>
<i>that Jennifer</i>

37:18.172 --> 37:19.809
<i>made a worse dish</i>
<i>than I did.</i>

37:19.809 --> 37:22.347
I'm not ready
to go home yet.

37:29.662 --> 37:31.799
That was an intense
pressure test.

37:31.799 --> 37:36.241
Some of you excelled
when it came to cooking
my dish,

37:36.241 --> 37:38.680
but a handful of you guys
struggled mightily.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.853
We're going to be saying
adios, goodbye,

37:41.853 --> 37:43.823
to at least one
of you.

37:43.823 --> 37:46.729
The good news...
the winning dish

37:46.729 --> 37:49.034
was really a great
representation

37:49.034 --> 37:52.106
of my dish,
and that dish belonged to...

37:52.106 --> 37:53.877
Dino.

37:53.877 --> 37:55.781
Join everyone
in the balcony, please.

37:55.781 --> 37:58.620
‐ Thank you, Chefs.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

37:58.620 --> 38:01.358
I feel
completely validated.

38:01.358 --> 38:02.961
‐ Hey.
‐ Come on up, baby,
we've been waiting for you.

38:02.961 --> 38:04.230
Come on.

38:04.230 --> 38:07.403
I feel like I earned
my spot up on that balcony.

38:07.403 --> 38:09.809
<i>Pork chop is my mother's</i>
<i>favorite dish.</i>

38:09.809 --> 38:12.313
<i>She's gonna be</i>
<i>so proud of me.</i>

38:12.313 --> 38:16.856
There's more than just Dino
that managed to impress us
tonight.

38:16.856 --> 38:18.258
Gabriel,

38:18.258 --> 38:20.029
Caitlin,

38:20.029 --> 38:21.532
and...

38:21.532 --> 38:24.037
Jenny.
Head up to the balcony.

38:24.037 --> 38:25.272
Thank you, Chef.

38:25.272 --> 38:27.945
I am not gonna throw
this second chance away.

38:27.945 --> 38:29.247
Come on home, y'all.

38:29.247 --> 38:30.584
Caitlin:
<i>I am super focused</i>

38:30.584 --> 38:32.588
<i>and I want to show</i>
<i>that I'm a strong individual</i>

38:32.588 --> 38:35.126
that has the potential
to be the next MasterChef.

38:36.261 --> 38:38.265
Whew!

38:38.265 --> 38:39.869
Jennifer,

38:39.869 --> 38:44.077
I wanted you to shine,
and we didn't get that.

38:44.077 --> 38:45.814
‐ Have you peaked?
‐ No.

38:45.814 --> 38:48.720
What I did today,
it's only a small fraction

38:48.720 --> 38:50.289
of what I'm capable of.

38:50.289 --> 38:53.162
It's just,
I've made a mistake.

38:53.162 --> 38:55.734
But I'm here to learn.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.638
I mean, this is hard.
This is hard work.

38:57.638 --> 38:59.007
I know what
hard work means,

38:59.007 --> 39:01.612
and I know what this is
and I see this in front of me.

39:01.612 --> 39:03.950
I really do care
about being here.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.352
I care.

39:05.352 --> 39:07.925
We're not tasting it.

39:09.127 --> 39:11.131
Paige.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.634
You're the youngest,

39:12.634 --> 39:15.239
but have you go
the passion to keep going

39:15.239 --> 39:17.744
from the bottom of your heart,
young lady?

39:17.744 --> 39:19.480
I do have the heart.
I do have the passion.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.251
I wouldn't be standing
in front of you here

39:21.251 --> 39:24.457
if I did not think that I had
either of those things.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.906
Jennifer, Paige,
both of you, watch.

39:31.906 --> 39:35.012
Pay close attention.

39:35.012 --> 39:38.753
We're gonna go
to the balcony.

39:38.753 --> 39:43.028
Now, which one
of these two girls

39:43.028 --> 39:47.804
deserves to stay
in this competition?

39:47.804 --> 39:51.278
‐ Cate?
‐ Jen.

39:51.278 --> 39:53.616
‐ Newton.
‐ Jen.

39:53.616 --> 39:55.887
‐ Adam.
‐ Jennifer, Chef.

39:55.887 --> 39:57.624
Reba:
Jennifer, Chef.

39:57.624 --> 40:00.129
Absolutely Jennifer,
Chef Ramsay.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.507
Heather:
Jennifer, Chef.

40:05.507 --> 40:07.009
Brien:
Jennifer, Chef.

40:07.009 --> 40:09.047
No question.
Jennifer, Chef.

40:09.047 --> 40:10.349
Jennifer, Chef.

40:10.349 --> 40:11.351
Daniel:
Jennifer, Chef.

40:11.351 --> 40:13.155
100% Jennifer, Chef.

40:13.155 --> 40:14.190
Caitlin:
Jennifer.

40:14.190 --> 40:17.196
Jenny:
100% Jennifer.

40:17.196 --> 40:19.334
Consensus.
Jennifer.

40:19.334 --> 40:23.075
Gordon:
Christina, Aarón
and myself agree.

40:23.075 --> 40:25.079
Jennifer, head up
to the balcony.

40:25.079 --> 40:27.617
( cheers, applause )

40:30.890 --> 40:34.130
The warmth that just went
through my body every time
somebody said my name

40:34.130 --> 40:35.900
<i>it woke me up spiritually.</i>

40:35.900 --> 40:38.539
<i>It was like "Jennifer,</i>
<i>you are a good cook.</i>

40:38.539 --> 40:40.476
<i>You can do this."</i>

40:40.476 --> 40:43.816
I need to make small steps
in this competition,

40:43.816 --> 40:46.555
to gain the confidence
in myself,

40:46.555 --> 40:47.824
<i>and just get</i>
<i>out of my head.</i>

40:50.663 --> 40:52.801
Paige, young lady,
you're courageous.

40:52.801 --> 40:54.905
you've got a bright
future ahead of you.

40:54.905 --> 40:56.441
‐ Thank you, please.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

40:56.441 --> 40:58.846
Take your apron off,
and place it on your bench.

40:58.846 --> 41:00.817
Good night.

41:00.817 --> 41:02.954
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Paige: <i>Wow, this has been</i>
<i>an amazing experience.</i>

41:02.954 --> 41:06.060
I'm sad to go,
but I'm happy to go home.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.432
I'm excited to get back
to my own kitchen

41:08.432 --> 41:10.570
<i>along the Hawaiian beach</i>
<i>and hear the waves</i>

41:10.570 --> 41:13.041
<i>as I cook my heart out</i>
<i>for my family</i>

41:13.041 --> 41:16.448
and continue growing
as a chef and as a person.

41:19.888 --> 41:21.926
Announcer:
<i>Next time, on MasterChef...</i>

41:21.926 --> 41:25.098
Lift those boxes.

41:25.098 --> 41:28.673
Announcer:
<i>A mystery box challenge</i>
<i>that's alive.</i>

41:28.673 --> 41:30.476
‐ Woman: God.
‐ <i>And kicking.</i>

41:30.476 --> 41:33.649
This competition
is just getting started.

41:33.649 --> 41:35.787
‐ <i>And then...</i>
‐ Watch and learn.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.456
<i>a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>master class...</i>

41:37.456 --> 41:40.128
30 million people
have seen him do this dish.

41:40.128 --> 41:41.799
Is this even real?

41:41.799 --> 41:42.834
<i>...leads</i>
<i>to an elimination...</i>

41:42.834 --> 41:44.872
What do I need,
a ( bleep ) straw?

41:44.872 --> 41:46.040
<i>that's hard to swallow.</i>

41:46.040 --> 41:47.777
‐ ( cough )
‐ ( gasps )

41:47.777 --> 41:50.550
‐ Aarón: You can't get past
one bite of it.
‐ Oh, my God.
