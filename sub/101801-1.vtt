WEBVTT

01:47.742 --> 01:49.376
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:49.409 --> 01:50.410
So I spoke with George Ronson.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.046
You'd have to stretch
to twenty-five thousand

01:52.080 --> 01:54.015
if you want her residency
visa pushed through.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.585
He said he can deport an illegal
for free, but a visa costs.

01:57.619 --> 01:58.886
Fair enough.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.320
How'd Heimi react?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.455
As expected.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.291
Listen, I want to do my yearly
donations. Are you free?

02:04.324 --> 02:07.494
Sure. I'll just load last
year's sheet.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.933
OK, last year you donated
just over 1.2 million.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.534
What's this year's going to be?

02:15.168 --> 02:16.838
Adjust the small
charities to match inflation

02:16.871 --> 02:19.574
but I want to make some
changes to the big ones.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.242
OK. Farmers' Drought Relief?

02:22.844 --> 02:24.411
How much did I donate last
year?

02:24.444 --> 02:26.380
One hundred thousand.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.982
OK, up that to one-fifty.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.183
Bushfire Relief?

02:30.217 --> 02:33.453
Put another twenty grand on
top of that one.

02:33.788 --> 02:35.857
That makes it one hundred
and seventy thousand.

02:35.890 --> 02:39.861
Homeless Welfare and
Animal Protection Services?

02:40.327 --> 02:43.564
Both, two hundred thousand
each.

02:44.364 --> 02:45.700
And that's the lot.

02:45.733 --> 02:49.904
OK, yeah, thanks.
I'll call you back when I hear from Heimi.

03:06.821 --> 03:07.789
Hello?

03:07.822 --> 03:09.891
Hello Jake.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.059
Who's this?

03:11.092 --> 03:14.062
You don't know me,
but I know you very well.

03:14.095 --> 03:15.362
Is this a fucking joke?

03:15.395 --> 03:17.899
No, Jake, this is very
real.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.601
I have a gun pressed to your
son's head.

03:20.635 --> 03:21.769
Dad help!

03:21.803 --> 03:23.270
Josh, Josh!

03:23.303 --> 03:24.639
Josh is going to be
fine

03:24.672 --> 03:27.575
so long as you do everything
that I say.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.810
What do you want, money?

03:28.843 --> 03:31.112
No, Jake,
unlike your conscience,

03:31.145 --> 03:33.047
I'm not so easily bought.

03:33.081 --> 03:35.983
You make some measly
donations to charities

03:36.017 --> 03:39.486
and you think that absolves
you of all your wrongdoing?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.823
You call 1.2 million dollars
measly?

03:41.856 --> 03:43.524
It is to a guy like
you.

03:43.558 --> 03:46.661
How much do you stand to make
from extorting Heimi Ronstoldt

03:46.694 --> 03:50.698
into giving you a five
percent stake in his company?

03:50.732 --> 03:52.200
How do you know about Heimi?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.736
I've been watching
you for a long time,

03:54.769 --> 03:56.037
listening to every lie

03:56.070 --> 03:58.873
that comes out of your
disgusting mouth.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.440
You stand to make two million

04:00.474 --> 04:02.375
from the deal with Heimi alone.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.511
Right, if you know about Heimi

04:03.544 --> 04:05.613
then you know he's helping
his sister break the law.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.481
That doesn't
justify your actions,

04:07.515 --> 04:10.317
and you know it. That's
why you donate to charity.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.520
Makes you feel better about
yourself.

04:12.553 --> 04:17.091
Donations are your confession,
they absolve your sins.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.093
Alright, if you don't want
money, then what do you want?

04:19.127 --> 04:21.294
I want to save you,
Jake.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.898
I want to save you from
yourself.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.533
Let's start by righting that
little wrong

04:25.566 --> 04:26.801
you were in the middle of.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.669
You're going to call
Heimi back and tell him

04:28.703 --> 04:31.072
you don't want five percent
of his company anymore,

04:31.105 --> 04:33.908
but tell him you're still
going to get his sister a visa.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.810
I'll call you back soon.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.767
You've got some balls,

04:59.801 --> 05:01.502
calling me after what happened
last time.

05:01.536 --> 05:05.139
Forget about last time,
I got a big tip for you.

05:05.173 --> 05:06.874
Brian, I'm not interested.

05:06.908 --> 05:09.877
Seriously, you're gonna
want to look into this one.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.445
That's my wife calling.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.347
You give me one good reason
why I should hang up on her

05:14.381 --> 05:15.348
and not on you?

05:15.382 --> 05:17.585
Forty-five million dollars.

05:20.855 --> 05:23.558
OK, I'm listening.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.992
The firm's called Omni-soft.

05:25.026 --> 05:28.162
It's run by Alexander
Whitlock and Heimi Ronstoldt.

05:28.196 --> 05:30.531
They develop missile guidance
software.

05:30.565 --> 05:32.700
They're about to do a
forty-five million dollar deal

05:32.733 --> 05:35.102
with the Saudi defense
contractors, Zennon.

05:35.136 --> 05:38.172
Yeah, I don't know, Brian,
a deal this big'd be on my radar

05:38.206 --> 05:39.874
and this is the first I'm
hearing of it.

05:39.907 --> 05:40.942
Well, no one's heard of it

05:40.975 --> 05:43.010
because that's the way they want
it.

05:43.044 --> 05:44.377
How'd you hear about it?

05:44.411 --> 05:45.880
Little bird told me.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.582
It sounds flimsy at best.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.784
The intel on this is solid.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.019
It's forty-five million dollars,
Jake.

05:52.053 --> 05:55.056
Surely that's worth looking
into.

06:00.161 --> 06:03.831
I'm gonna regret this. I'll be
in touch.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.576
Jake, how are you?

06:15.610 --> 06:16.577
I need everything you can get
me

06:16.611 --> 06:18.746
on a start-up called Omni-soft.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.981
What am I looking for?

06:20.014 --> 06:21.616
I'm looking for a
forty-five million dollar deal

06:21.649 --> 06:24.585
with a defense contractor from
Saudi Arabia called Zennon.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.687
OK, anything else?

06:26.721 --> 06:27.922
Yeah, I need leverage.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.957
There's two directors of the
company. Get me dirt on them.

06:29.991 --> 06:32.360
Anything you can, but I need it
ASAP.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.227
Copy that.

06:58.319 --> 06:59.387
Hi.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.522
Hi. Sorry, I wasn't
hanging up on you before,

07:01.555 --> 07:03.824
my phone's been playing up.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.327
I don't want to hear it,
Jake, is Josh with you?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.062
Why would he be with me?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.297
Because you're supposed to
pick him up

07:09.330 --> 07:11.399
from football practice tonight.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.267
I thought you were doing that.

07:13.301 --> 07:15.269
I told you, I'm at my
sister's.

07:15.303 --> 07:16.737
I'm not even in the state.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.273
You didn't go home last night,
did you?

07:19.307 --> 07:21.776
No, I slept at the office.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.443
Who fed Josh?

07:23.476 --> 07:26.180
Josh can feed himself,
the fridge is full.

07:26.681 --> 07:28.749
Have you spoken to him today?

07:28.783 --> 07:30.918
No, I have not.

07:31.252 --> 07:34.522
I've been calling his mobile
all day, he's not answering.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.791
You need to go and get him.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.193
Josh is fine, you worry too
much Susan.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.063
You don't worry enough. Where
are you?

07:42.096 --> 07:45.766
What could be more important
than picking up our son?

07:46.167 --> 07:48.002
I am in a car park,

07:48.035 --> 07:51.038
I've got a business deal I'm
looking into.

07:51.272 --> 07:53.574
Stop what you're doing.
Go and pick him up.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.277
Call me when you've got him.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.496
Hey, what have you got?

08:16.530 --> 08:18.466
It's Omni-soft. Started four
years ago

08:18.498 --> 08:20.634
by Alexander Whitlock and Heimi
Ronstoldt.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.370
Their private email basically
confirms

08:22.403 --> 08:23.938
the deal you mentioned. But...
But Jake,

08:23.971 --> 08:27.742
it finalizes tomorrow.
Forty-five million over five years.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.411
Yeah good, good. What about
dirt?

08:30.444 --> 08:31.879
They're both actually pretty
squeaky.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.115
I mean, they both pay taxes,
there's no arrests or anything.

08:34.148 --> 08:37.318
Just, Heimi's into kink porn,
which is nothing illegal.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.987
Don't tell me they're
clean. No one's ever clean.

08:40.021 --> 08:42.123
OK, well, Alexander is
a bar of soap, all right.

08:42.156 --> 08:45.526
But Heimi's sister, Jake,
she's in the country illegally.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.362
And that is why I love you.

08:48.396 --> 08:52.133
Get me her details and
Heimi's mobile number.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.640
Hey.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.143
Hey, I need you to reach
out to George Ronson.

09:02.176 --> 09:03.411
Why do I know that name?

09:03.444 --> 09:05.646
We did a deal for him three
years back,

09:05.679 --> 09:07.516
made him a lot of money
on the bionics buy-in.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.582
He's high up in immigration.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.451
Tell him I'm calling in
the favor he owes me.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.253
OK. What kind of favor?

09:12.887 --> 09:13.821
There's an illegal immigrant

09:13.854 --> 09:16.624
I might need to pull the pin on,
or help,

09:16.657 --> 09:18.826
depending on which way
the conversation goes.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.693
Will he go for that?

09:19.727 --> 09:21.028
He will at the right price,

09:21.062 --> 09:22.531
but we're gonna have to grease
him.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.800
Start at ten grand but go
to twenty if you have to.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.302
Will do. I'll call you
once I've spoken to him.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.818
Hello?

09:43.851 --> 09:46.020
Is this Heimi Ronstoldt?

09:47.621 --> 09:48.722
Who's this?

09:49.924 --> 09:52.726
Jake Galloway. I've got a
business proposition for you

09:52.760 --> 09:54.595
regarding your sister.

09:57.465 --> 09:58.966
You know my sister?

10:00.535 --> 10:03.572
I know she's living here
illegally at 62 Carlton Avenue.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.676
I also know a senior official
who works in immigration

10:08.709 --> 10:10.377
who owes me a favor.

10:13.848 --> 10:16.585
What the hell do you want?

10:16.617 --> 10:18.752
Five percent of your company.

10:18.786 --> 10:23.791
No way. Do you have any
idea how much that's worth?

10:24.058 --> 10:28.295
One phone call and I can
have your sister deported,

10:28.329 --> 10:32.166
tonight, or I can get her a
visa.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.505
You think on it, I'll call you
back.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.052
What is this, a fucking
joke?

10:52.086 --> 10:54.788
No, Jake, this is very
real,

10:54.822 --> 10:57.658
I have a gun pressed to your
son's head.

11:04.064 --> 11:04.865
Jake?

11:04.899 --> 11:05.699
Someone has Josh.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.301
What do you mean?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.070
Someone's kidnapped
Josh, what should I do?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.839
Hang up now and phone the
police.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.717
Hello, this is the
police.

11:23.751 --> 11:24.718
What the f-?

11:24.752 --> 11:27.622
Such a simple
task and yet you failed.

11:27.656 --> 11:31.158
I'm not like you, Jake. I
leave nothing to chance.

11:31.192 --> 11:35.396
Right now I have your son with
my gun pressed to his head.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.997
Don't you fuckin' hurt him.

11:37.031 --> 11:39.366
Then don't give me
reason to.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.802
Call Heimi, tell him the deal's
off,

11:41.835 --> 11:44.506
but you're still going to
get his sister the visa.

11:44.539 --> 11:49.743
And remember, I'm listening
to everything you say.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.520
What did the police say?

11:58.553 --> 12:00.555
Listen to me very carefully,
get Ronson on the phone

12:00.589 --> 12:03.157
and get this girl's visa approved,
pay whatever you have to,

12:03.190 --> 12:06.260
OK, just get it done.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.007
Hello?

12:21.141 --> 12:25.946
Yeah, Heimi, it's Jake.
Forget what I said before.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.047
I've changed my mind,

12:28.882 --> 12:31.385
I don't want five percent
of your company anymore.

12:39.793 --> 12:44.331
What you said earlier
about my sister's visa,

12:46.900 --> 12:50.371
is that still something
you can make happen?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.376
Because if it is I'd be
willing to pay for it.

13:02.751 --> 13:03.685
How much?

13:05.986 --> 13:10.991
If you can guarantee me
that everything goes through,

13:11.392 --> 13:13.394
fifty thousand.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.797
Double it and you've got a
deal.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.667
How do I get you the money?

13:18.700 --> 13:22.704
My assistant will contact
you with the details.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.882
Hello?

13:34.915 --> 13:37.686
Your thirst
for money is insatiable.

13:37.719 --> 13:40.988
But I did what you said,
Heimi's sister's getting a visa,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.924
I'm not getting any of his
company, now you let Josh go.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.827
No, Jake, you
missed the point entirely.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.431
You were supposed to right
your wrong, not profit from it.

13:50.464 --> 13:52.132
Listen to me, the money coming
from Heimi is for you

13:52.166 --> 13:55.436
plus double from me when
you free Josh, unharmed.

13:55.469 --> 13:56.638
As I've already said

13:56.671 --> 13:58.540
but you evidently weren't
listening,

13:58.573 --> 14:02.009
some of us aren't swayed
by money so easily.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.211
What do you want from me?

14:05.647 --> 14:07.147
I need you
to drive to the address

14:07.181 --> 14:08.282
I just sent you.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.051
Why? What's there?

14:11.085 --> 14:13.187
You'll find out when
you arrive.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.988
But I'd hurry if I were you,

14:15.022 --> 14:16.758
if you're not there in two
minutes,

14:16.791 --> 14:18.992
there'll be consequences.

14:33.641 --> 14:34.441
Hey.

14:34.475 --> 14:36.745
Hi. Is Josh with you?

14:38.513 --> 14:43.317
Ah, no, he's gone to
see a movie with a friend.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.619
Who?

14:44.652 --> 14:46.186
Ah, I think it was Michael?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.289
He hasn't spoken to
Michael in over a year.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.658
Maybe it wasn't Michael.

14:51.492 --> 14:52.893
I told him that you were worried
about him

14:52.926 --> 14:54.395
and he said to say that he was
fine.

14:54.428 --> 14:56.865
You're quite possibly
the worst liar on Earth.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.432
Where is our son, Jake?

14:59.734 --> 15:01.736
Susan, he's gone to the
movies with a friend, OK.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.104
I've got another call coming
through. I've got to go.

15:06.641 --> 15:07.509
Hello?

15:07.542 --> 15:10.512
Time's up, Jake,
you're late.

15:10.545 --> 15:12.946
You gave me two minutes
to make a five minute drive,

15:12.980 --> 15:13.914
what do you expect?

15:13.947 --> 15:15.683
I expect you to do
what it takes

15:15.717 --> 15:17.284
to get there on time.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.787
There's police around.

15:18.820 --> 15:20.588
You'll break
the law to make money,

15:20.622 --> 15:23.658
but when it comes to your
family you won't take the risk.

15:23.691 --> 15:27.394
I told you, if you didn't
make the drive in two minutes,

15:27.428 --> 15:29.229
there'd be consequences.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.366
Just don't hurt Josh,

15:32.399 --> 15:34.602
I'll be there as quick as I can,
OK?

15:34.636 --> 15:37.104
Why should I
give you a second chance?

15:37.137 --> 15:40.441
You never give any of
your prey second chances.

15:40.474 --> 15:41.942
I don't prey on people.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.646
That's all you do. You've made
a career

15:44.679 --> 15:46.980
of exploiting other
people's vulnerabilities

15:47.014 --> 15:48.716
to your own end.

15:48.750 --> 15:52.554
What I do is only ever
business, it's never personal.

15:52.587 --> 15:55.489
Try telling that to
the family of Vince Bullham.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.527
Vince was disturbed.

15:59.561 --> 16:01.962
You're right, he was,

16:01.995 --> 16:05.767
and you used that to your
advantage.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.502
No, that's not fair.

16:07.535 --> 16:10.237
And don't try to pin his
suicide on me either.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.873
You knew he was
disturbed,

16:11.906 --> 16:12.907
but that didn't stop you

16:12.941 --> 16:15.577
from conning him out of his life
savings.

16:15.610 --> 16:17.645
I offered him an investment
opportunity.

16:17.679 --> 16:20.447
No, you blackmailed
him into putting his money

16:20.481 --> 16:23.785
into a construction
company that went bankrupt.

16:23.818 --> 16:26.554
However you want to frame
it, he invested in a company,

16:26.588 --> 16:28.756
it went bust. It happens.

16:28.790 --> 16:31.793
Not before you
took a twenty percent cut.

16:31.826 --> 16:35.128
The investment company was
designed to go bankrupt,

16:35.162 --> 16:38.633
there was never any
intention to build anything.

16:38.666 --> 16:39.767
You can't prove that.

16:39.801 --> 16:42.937
I don't need to.
This isn't a court of law,

16:42.971 --> 16:45.205
there's no due process here.

17:18.606 --> 17:20.274
OK, I'm here.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.175
Good.

17:23.477 --> 17:28.148
I just sent you a link to a
live video stream. Click it.

17:48.770 --> 17:50.572
What the hell is this?

17:50.605 --> 17:51.873
There must be
consequences

17:51.906 --> 17:55.208
for your inability to follow
orders.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.343
What orders?

17:56.376 --> 17:58.913
I gave you two
minutes to make the drive here.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.848
You could have made it if
you'd broken the speed limit,

18:00.882 --> 18:02.650
but you chose not to.

18:02.684 --> 18:04.484
What's that got to do
with Michelle and Brian?

18:04.519 --> 18:05.352
You must learn

18:05.385 --> 18:07.722
that your actions affect other
people.

18:07.755 --> 18:08.890
I already know that.

18:08.923 --> 18:10.490
No, all you know is

18:10.525 --> 18:13.928
that your actions affect people
that mean nothing to you.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.462
Now you're about to see your
actions

18:15.495 --> 18:17.197
hurt those close to you.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.300
Because you disobeyed me
one of them will be shot.

18:20.334 --> 18:22.135
And now you must decide who.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.105
Will it be Michelle,
your faithful assistant,

18:25.138 --> 18:27.174
who does your bidding
without consideration

18:27.207 --> 18:30.011
for the ramifications of her
actions?

18:30.044 --> 18:33.715
Or will it be Brian, your
weasel of an informant

18:33.748 --> 18:36.050
who spends his life sniffing out
the weak

18:36.084 --> 18:38.352
and vulnerable for you to
exploit?

18:38.385 --> 18:41.154
Wait? You're seriously
going to shoot one of them

18:41.188 --> 18:43.256
because I didn't drive here on
time?

18:43.290 --> 18:47.028
Yes. Now decide, who
will it be?

18:48.563 --> 18:50.064
No you can't make me decide
like that.

18:50.098 --> 18:51.164
That's... That's fucked up.

18:51.198 --> 18:55.069
I'm not, I'm not gonna
decide who you fucking kill.

18:55.103 --> 18:57.605
I'm not going to kill
anyone.

18:57.639 --> 19:01.542
I'm as far from these people
as you are. Now who will it be?

19:01.576 --> 19:03.945
Michelle, or Brian?

19:03.978 --> 19:04.912
Neither.

19:04.946 --> 19:07.214
Wrong answer.
If you won't choose,

19:07.247 --> 19:10.250
they'll both be shot. Last
chance, Jake.

19:11.552 --> 19:14.421
No, I'm not gonna decide who
you shoot.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.256
I'm not doing it, No.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.325
Then you've made your
decision.

19:39.914 --> 19:42.349
What the fuck is wrong with
you? Why did you do that?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.520
To teach you that
your actions have consequences.

19:45.553 --> 19:47.989
You just killed two innocent
people.

19:48.022 --> 19:50.290
Their deaths
are on you, Jake, not me.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.192
You could've saved one of their
lives.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.395
You were the one that decided
both of them should die.

19:55.429 --> 19:58.298
You're sick. You know that?
You're fucked in the head.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.901
As empowering as it
may feel

19:59.934 --> 20:02.570
to talk to me that way, may I
remind you

20:02.603 --> 20:04.438
that I have your son,

20:04.471 --> 20:07.075
and you've just seen how
far I'm willing to go.

20:07.108 --> 20:10.277
Why am I here? What do you
want from me?

20:10.310 --> 20:12.580
All will be explained
in time.

20:12.613 --> 20:17.919
But for now I need you to take
deep breaths. Gain control.

20:19.620 --> 20:20.822
There, there, there's a deep
breath.

20:20.855 --> 20:21.823
I'm perfectly fucking calm.

20:21.856 --> 20:23.858
Now you tell me, why the fuck am
I here?

20:23.891 --> 20:25.860
Just one of
your many flaws, Jake,

20:25.893 --> 20:27.128
you never listen.

20:27.161 --> 20:30.263
Are you going to make me hurt
Josh to get you to calm down?

20:31.231 --> 20:38.238
No. Just, hang on a
sec, just, all right,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.907
just give me a minute.

20:39.941 --> 20:42.510
Take two, I'll be
waiting.

21:10.505 --> 21:12.073
You there?

21:12.106 --> 21:14.374
I am. Are you calm?

21:15.843 --> 21:16.978
Considering the situation,

21:17.011 --> 21:19.147
I'm about as calm as you
could expect me to be.

21:19.180 --> 21:21.582
That's the first honest
thing you've said all day.

21:21.616 --> 21:24.652
Congratulations, you've
just taken your first step

21:24.685 --> 21:26.386
on the road to recovery.

21:26.419 --> 21:30.423
Great. Now why the hell am I
here?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.627
I need you to look
in the back of your car,

21:32.660 --> 21:36.631
but before you do that,
you need to brace yourself.

21:36.664 --> 21:37.765
Why?

21:37.799 --> 21:40.234
Open it, you'll
see, but be warned,

21:40.268 --> 21:41.969
you'll be surprised.

21:43.037 --> 21:45.206
Why the hell did you get me
to drive here in such a hurry

21:45.239 --> 21:47.474
when all you wanted me to do
was look at the back of my car?

21:47.508 --> 21:49.010
I could have done that where I
was.

21:49.043 --> 21:51.444
The drive was a test
to see if you'd break the law

21:51.478 --> 21:54.882
in aid of your family. A
test you failed miserably.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.952
Now, do as I say, open the back.

22:11.899 --> 22:13.968
What the hell is this?

22:14.001 --> 22:16.103
Open it. You'll see.

22:16.137 --> 22:19.841
The combination is your son's
birthday.

22:38.025 --> 22:40.294
Why the hell is there a
woman in the back of my car?

22:40.328 --> 22:42.196
That woman
is directly responsible

22:42.230 --> 22:44.298
for your current predicament.

22:44.332 --> 22:45.498
Who the hell is she?

22:45.533 --> 22:47.735
You'll find out in
time.

22:49.537 --> 22:52.506
I just sent you a new address
that you need to drive to.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.441
Oh, and I'd hurry if I were you.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.377
You've got two minutes to
get to the new location

22:57.410 --> 22:59.714
or there'll be consequences.

23:18.966 --> 23:20.601
Shit.

23:20.635 --> 23:22.670
Now is not the time to
panic.

23:22.703 --> 23:25.405
I need you to pull the car
over to the side of the road

23:25.438 --> 23:27.575
as though nothing is wrong.

23:41.923 --> 23:43.524
Alright, now what?

23:43.557 --> 23:45.726
Now you need to
talk your way out of this.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.694
Are you fucking serious?

23:46.727 --> 23:47.828
How am I going to talk my way
out of this?

23:47.862 --> 23:49.530
I just got clocked doing
twice the speed limit.

23:49.563 --> 23:51.498
There's no way I'm getting away
from this.

23:51.532 --> 23:55.202
This is a great test,
Jake. How honest can you be?

23:55.236 --> 23:56.570
Police are lied to every day,

23:56.604 --> 23:58.940
they're trained to see through
bullshit.

23:58.973 --> 24:01.242
Your only way out of
this is to be honest.

24:01.275 --> 24:03.344
But just in case that doesn't
work,

24:03.377 --> 24:05.713
reach down beside your seat.

24:15.923 --> 24:17.558
No fucking way. No way.

24:17.591 --> 24:19.593
Desperate times, Jake.

24:19.627 --> 24:21.996
If you can't get away, you're
no longer any use to me

24:22.029 --> 24:25.933
and neither is your son.
Leave me on speakerphone.

24:32.406 --> 24:33.207
Hi.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.041
License, please.

24:34.075 --> 24:36.177
Can you cut the engine as well?

24:41.515 --> 24:43.117
Do you know why I pulled you
over?

24:44.585 --> 24:47.822
Ah, yeah, I was, uh, speeding.

24:48.055 --> 24:51.525
One-ten in a fifty zone.
That's not speeding. It's drag racing.

24:51.559 --> 24:52.693
Any good reason?

24:52.727 --> 24:55.997
Yeah, I was um, I was
in a rush to get my kid.

24:56.030 --> 24:58.265
Well that doesn't justify
doubling the speed limit,

24:58.299 --> 24:59.499
does it?

24:59.533 --> 25:01.669
You're putting people's lives
at risk, driving like that.

25:01.702 --> 25:02.937
I'm aware of that, officer,
and I'm,

25:02.970 --> 25:04.972
I'm really sorry it won't
happen again, I apologize.

25:05.006 --> 25:06.140
Well it's a bit late for
apologies now.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.976
You drive that fast and it's
instant loss of license.

25:09.010 --> 25:10.778
Give me your keys and get out of
the car.

25:12.580 --> 25:15.916
Look, I wasn't, I wasn't just
speeding to pick up my kid,

25:15.950 --> 25:16.784
OK, he's...

25:19.086 --> 25:20.788
he's in trouble.

25:20.821 --> 25:22.790
What kind of trouble?

25:22.823 --> 25:24.759
He's with someone I
don't want him to be with.

25:24.792 --> 25:26.761
Well, if your son's in
trouble I can send police

25:26.794 --> 25:28.329
to where he is.

25:28.362 --> 25:30.631
No, the police can't help me
at all.

25:30.664 --> 25:32.366
I need to deal with this myself.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.068
Mate, if you're in danger
and your son's in trouble,

25:34.101 --> 25:35.569
the best thing that you can be
doing

25:35.603 --> 25:37.171
is involving the police.

25:38.039 --> 25:38.873
I can't.

25:39.974 --> 25:42.877
Yeah OK, well, then I can't
help you.

25:42.910 --> 25:46.580
So I need you to give me your
keys and get out of the car.

25:46.614 --> 25:47.648
Have you got a kid?

25:49.316 --> 25:52.620
Yeah, I've got a kid. That's
got nothing to do with this.

25:52.653 --> 25:55.423
No it does. Right, if
your kid was in danger

25:55.456 --> 25:56.690
and you were the only
person that could help them,

25:56.724 --> 25:57.992
how fast would you drive?

25:59.293 --> 26:01.095
Listen to me, I know you're an
officer.

26:01.128 --> 26:02.296
You've got a job to do.

26:02.329 --> 26:07.435
But just think, what would
you do to protect your child?

26:09.603 --> 26:10.771
I'm not gonna ask you again.

26:10.805 --> 26:13.574
I need you to give me your
keys and step out of the car.

26:13.607 --> 26:15.544
Look, I've done the wrong
thing, OK.

26:15.576 --> 26:16.377
I'm not trying to get out of it.

26:16.410 --> 26:17.912
Give me the biggest fine you've
got.

26:17.945 --> 26:20.181
But just don't take away
my car, not now, please.

26:20.214 --> 26:23.117
Get out of the car now.

26:24.185 --> 26:25.786
You don't have to do this.

26:25.820 --> 26:26.620
Now, out!

26:26.654 --> 26:28.089
Hey. Don't move.

26:29.056 --> 26:30.091
Easy.

26:30.124 --> 26:31.358
Are you alone? Is there
another cop back there?

26:31.392 --> 26:32.527
There's no one else
back there. It's just me.

26:32.561 --> 26:33.394
Right, have you got cuffs on
you?

26:33.427 --> 26:34.595
Yeah, I've got cuffs on me.

26:34.628 --> 26:36.397
Right. Throw the license
and the cuff keys in the car.

26:36.430 --> 26:37.498
Get the cuffs out

26:37.532 --> 26:39.568
put your hands behind
your back and cuff yourself.

26:54.148 --> 26:54.949
Right, are you done?

26:54.982 --> 26:55.883
Yeah.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.751
Turn around and show me.

27:01.523 --> 27:05.159
I'm sorry. I didn't want to do
this.

27:15.836 --> 27:17.638
Fuck!

27:21.208 --> 27:24.445
Well done, you just
took another step forward,

27:24.478 --> 27:26.981
not only did you not
lie to the officer once,

27:27.014 --> 27:29.683
but you just broke the
law in aid of your family.

27:29.717 --> 27:32.587
I'm starting to think maybe
you do care after all.

27:32.621 --> 27:34.088
Of course I care.

27:34.121 --> 27:37.358
You're late to your
new location, step on it.

27:37.391 --> 27:38.425
Are you serious?

27:39.528 --> 27:40.728
After what I just went
through with the police

27:40.761 --> 27:41.929
you want me to speed again?

27:41.962 --> 27:44.298
Yes. It's tough isn't
it,

27:44.331 --> 27:46.535
these rock-and-a-hard place
decisions?

27:46.568 --> 27:48.869
Are you starting to get
a feel for what it's like

27:48.903 --> 27:50.905
to be one of your victims?

28:21.268 --> 28:22.870
OK, I'm here. Now what?

28:22.903 --> 28:24.673
Take a look around.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.441
Do you recognize any of the
cars?

28:32.379 --> 28:33.981
No, should I?

28:34.014 --> 28:35.950
Look closer.

28:35.983 --> 28:39.253
The blue Porsche doesn't look
familiar?

28:45.226 --> 28:48.362
My wife has the same model, so
what?

28:48.395 --> 28:51.865
Look at the license
plate, Jake.

28:52.266 --> 28:53.867
OK. So it's my wife's car.

28:53.901 --> 28:55.769
She said she's out of
the state.

28:55.803 --> 28:57.505
Why do you think her car's here?

28:57.539 --> 29:00.040
I don't know, maybe
she lent it to a friend?

29:00.074 --> 29:01.308
What if she
hasn't left the state

29:01.342 --> 29:02.711
to go and see her sister?

29:02.743 --> 29:04.579
What if she's in one of the
houses nearby

29:04.613 --> 29:09.517
having an affair? Might
that be a possibility?

29:10.719 --> 29:14.888
When was the last
time you and your wife had sex?

29:17.559 --> 29:18.892
What's that got to do with
anything?

29:18.926 --> 29:21.696
Everything. Answer the
question.

29:21.730 --> 29:23.430
No. It's none of your
business.

29:23.464 --> 29:25.232
Everything is my
business.

29:25.266 --> 29:29.470
Consider me your doctor, the
only way to heal is to share.

29:29.504 --> 29:30.639
Yeah, but you're not a doctor.

29:30.672 --> 29:32.439
And what do you
base that assumption on?

29:32.473 --> 29:35.744
You know nothing about me,
other than what I look like,

29:35.776 --> 29:37.845
while I know everything about
you.

29:37.878 --> 29:41.315
Wait, wait, wait, I
know what you look like?

29:41.348 --> 29:42.517
When did we meet?

29:42.550 --> 29:43.817
Very recently.

29:43.851 --> 29:45.520
Now stop deflecting and tell me

29:45.553 --> 29:48.222
when the last time you had
sex with your wife was?

29:48.255 --> 29:49.923
You say you know everything
about me,

29:49.957 --> 29:51.760
so surely you already know that.

29:51.792 --> 29:54.795
You're right, I
do, but this isn't about me.

29:54.828 --> 29:57.732
You need to face up to some home
truths.

29:57.766 --> 29:59.900
This isn't donating money to a
charity

29:59.933 --> 30:03.937
to feel better about yourself,
this is true confession.

30:03.971 --> 30:05.139
Now say it,

30:05.172 --> 30:08.677
when was the last time you
were intimate with your wife?

30:08.710 --> 30:12.479
Honestly, I'm not sure.

30:14.582 --> 30:16.884
More than a year ago, I think.

30:21.221 --> 30:24.726
I take meds to deal with my
anxiety,

30:24.759 --> 30:26.761
and they kind of mess
with my long term memory,

30:26.795 --> 30:31.566
so I, I honestly do not
remember.

30:31.999 --> 30:34.268
You gain points for
honesty,

30:34.301 --> 30:37.505
but you lose points for
deflecting again.

30:37.539 --> 30:38.939
I didn't deflect.

30:38.972 --> 30:40.508
Yes, you did.

30:40.542 --> 30:43.712
Rather than take responsibility
for your actions,

30:43.745 --> 30:46.947
you blamed your failure to
recall your last intimate moment

30:46.980 --> 30:49.183
with your wife on medication.

30:49.216 --> 30:52.754
If you'd taken time to
acknowledge your relationship,

30:52.787 --> 30:54.955
you wouldn't have to rely on a
hazy memory

30:54.988 --> 30:58.125
from so many years ago.
Therefore it's your fault

30:58.158 --> 31:01.495
you can't recall your
last marital intimacy.

31:01.529 --> 31:05.165
OK, fine if that's what
you want, then fine, alright,

31:05.199 --> 31:07.501
it's my fault, it's all my
fault. There, you satisfied?

31:07.535 --> 31:09.937
Say it like you mean
it.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.639
You want to hear me
say something I mean,

31:11.673 --> 31:14.542
you piece of shit? You're
fucked in the head.

31:14.576 --> 31:17.010
You're a lunatic. You say
you're doing this for me,

31:17.044 --> 31:18.011
but you're not doing this for
me,

31:18.045 --> 31:19.614
you're doing this for yourself.

31:19.647 --> 31:21.315
It's like you get some
sort of sick satisfaction

31:21.348 --> 31:23.150
out of this shit. You know what,

31:23.183 --> 31:24.786
I wouldn't be surprised
if you don't have a dick

31:24.819 --> 31:26.320
and this is your only way to get
off.

31:26.353 --> 31:28.222
You're just a sad sack piece of
shit.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.357
And this is your only way of
deriving some kind of meaning

31:30.391 --> 31:33.628
from your shitty little life. Am
I right?

31:36.497 --> 31:37.331
Hello?

31:46.741 --> 31:48.743
What the fuck did you fucking
say? Shit.

31:52.279 --> 31:54.181
Come on, ring me back.

31:59.821 --> 32:02.624
Hello. Don't hurt Josh, please.

32:02.657 --> 32:04.224
Don't hurt him, OK, look I'm
sorry,

32:04.258 --> 32:05.959
I shouldn't have said that.

32:05.993 --> 32:08.830
If you'd spoken to
me that way only a year ago,

32:08.863 --> 32:11.231
right now your son would be
dead.

32:11.265 --> 32:14.368
Right now, you'd have a
gun pressed to your head.

32:14.401 --> 32:17.772
You'd plead and plead,
begging for forgiveness.

32:17.806 --> 32:19.607
I'd show you a glimmer of hope.

32:19.641 --> 32:22.342
I'd let you think that
your cries for clemency

32:22.376 --> 32:23.778
had touched me.

32:23.812 --> 32:27.281
I'd lower my gun, allow
you a moment of reprieve.

32:27.314 --> 32:30.284
Then without warning, I'd
shoot you in the head.

32:30.317 --> 32:33.822
Your final thought,
one of utter confusion.

32:33.855 --> 32:35.824
But all that's in my past,

32:35.857 --> 32:39.026
I've gone through some
life-changing experiences.

32:39.059 --> 32:43.464
I've become pure. That's why
your son is not dead, yet.

32:43.497 --> 32:47.434
That's why you're still
breathing, for now.

32:47.468 --> 32:48.368
Thank you.

32:48.402 --> 32:50.705
No, Jake, don't thank
me.

32:50.738 --> 32:53.006
You hate me, I know that.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.175
If the opportunity arose, you'd
kill me

32:55.209 --> 32:57.879
and you'd feel justified doing
it.

32:58.913 --> 33:01.883
I just sent you a new
location. Step on it.

33:35.950 --> 33:37.017
I'm here.

33:37.050 --> 33:41.288
Do you see the
house at number eighty-six?

33:41.321 --> 33:42.356
Yeah, sure.

33:42.389 --> 33:45.527
Your wife is in
there with another man.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.662
If she was in there her
car would be parked out here,

33:47.695 --> 33:49.797
not back in the carpark.

33:49.831 --> 33:51.031
They meet at the
carpark,

33:51.064 --> 33:54.669
then he drives her here in
his car to avoid suspicion.

33:58.773 --> 34:01.843
No, no, I still don't buy it.

34:01.876 --> 34:03.578
I guess there's only one way
to find out for sure though,

34:03.611 --> 34:04.444
isn't there?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.448
Jake, get back in the
car.

34:09.316 --> 34:11.553
If you're not back in
the car in three seconds,

34:11.586 --> 34:13.922
I'm going to hurt Josh.

34:13.955 --> 34:16.356
Three, two, one.

34:16.558 --> 34:21.295
OK, I'll get back in the car.

34:32.740 --> 34:33.808
We're not here

34:33.841 --> 34:36.443
so you can barge in on
your wife with another man.

34:36.476 --> 34:39.246
That would be a very selfish act
indeed.

34:39.279 --> 34:40.782
And why would that be selfish?

34:40.815 --> 34:42.482
It would make you the
victim

34:42.517 --> 34:44.852
and feed your sense of betrayal.

34:44.886 --> 34:46.153
An affair is betrayal.

34:46.186 --> 34:49.222
The betrayal,
Jake, is yours, not hers.

34:49.256 --> 34:51.859
You need to understand and
accept this.

34:52.927 --> 34:55.462
No, no. There's two
people in a relationship,

34:55.495 --> 34:59.067
you can't lump all this on me,
she could have tried harder.

34:59.099 --> 35:01.903
Who chose to
bury themselves in work?

35:01.936 --> 35:05.073
Who canceled holidays, forgot
birthdays,

35:05.105 --> 35:06.941
missed Christmases?

35:06.975 --> 35:10.612
You removed yourself from the
relationship many years ago,

35:10.645 --> 35:12.847
and yet you still feel your wife
owes you

35:12.880 --> 35:15.449
the courtesy of monogamous love.

35:15.482 --> 35:17.184
If it's good enough for me.

35:17.217 --> 35:19.453
Considering how
much I know about you,

35:19.486 --> 35:22.957
don't assume I don't know about
your extramarital affairs.

35:24.191 --> 35:26.928
What are you talking about?
I've never had an affair.

35:26.961 --> 35:29.229
Perhaps not in the
traditional sense of the word,

35:29.262 --> 35:32.332
'affair'. But you have paid for
sex.

35:32.366 --> 35:34.636
Are you going to make
me show you the photos?

35:48.516 --> 35:51.719
OK. We've both cheated on each
other.

35:54.088 --> 35:55.288
Now what do you want?

35:55.322 --> 35:57.759
I want you to do
the best thing for your son.

35:57.792 --> 36:01.428
Ask yourself this, is
your son happy, Jake?

36:02.664 --> 36:05.533
Right now he's terrified,
but that's your doing,

36:06.668 --> 36:09.037
if it wasn't for you, he'd be
fine.

36:09.070 --> 36:12.073
That's not what
his psychiatrist says.

36:12.106 --> 36:13.841
He's not seeing a
psychiatrist.

36:16.944 --> 36:18.112
I just sent you the
notes

36:18.146 --> 36:23.751
from Josh's last psychiatric
session. Read it, I'll wait.

36:41.536 --> 36:43.236
Now you're aware of the true
nature

36:43.270 --> 36:44.839
of your home life,

36:44.872 --> 36:48.910
now you know your wife is
cheating on you.

36:49.443 --> 36:52.046
No. No, I don't know that.

36:52.245 --> 36:55.215
My son might be on meds,
but I don't know for a fact

36:55.248 --> 36:56.918
that my wife's cheating on me,

36:56.951 --> 36:59.654
all I've got is your word and
you know what I think of that.

37:02.657 --> 37:04.659
I just sent you a
photo.

37:04.692 --> 37:07.327
I had hoped that you'd take me
on my word,

37:07.360 --> 37:10.164
and that I wouldn't have to send
you this.

37:10.198 --> 37:15.570
But it's true what they say,
seeing really is believing.

37:31.652 --> 37:34.522
Alright, so you've proven
my wife's having an affair.

37:34.555 --> 37:38.358
Congratulations. Now, what else
you want?

37:38.391 --> 37:39.694
Now you need to decide

37:39.727 --> 37:42.163
what's truly best for your son.

37:42.196 --> 37:44.932
What's best for my son is
that you give him back to me

37:44.966 --> 37:48.202
right now, unharmed, and never
come into our lives again.

37:48.236 --> 37:49.504
If that were to
happen,

37:49.537 --> 37:52.305
would you tell Susan about
your extramarital affairs?

37:54.776 --> 37:55.977
You wouldn't, would you?

37:59.013 --> 38:00.948
What, you want me to
tell Susan everything?

38:00.982 --> 38:02.950
Yes, but I need you to
do it

38:02.984 --> 38:06.821
without letting her know that
you're aware of her affair.

38:06.854 --> 38:07.789
Why?

38:07.822 --> 38:09.524
To account
for your own wrongdoing,

38:09.557 --> 38:11.424
regardless of another's ill
acts,

38:11.458 --> 38:14.028
is a truly selfless gesture.

38:14.061 --> 38:16.030
I'll call you back when you're
done.

38:16.063 --> 38:18.465
Remember, I'm listening.

38:38.553 --> 38:39.520
Hi.

38:39.554 --> 38:40.387
Hey.

38:41.689 --> 38:44.625
Any news on Josh, or is
he still at the movies?

38:46.561 --> 38:47.728
No, he's...

38:51.666 --> 38:54.535
He's not at the movies. I um,

38:55.603 --> 38:57.370
I lied earlier.

38:58.606 --> 38:59.874
I know.

39:01.742 --> 39:04.477
You don't know where our
son is, do you, Jake?

39:04.512 --> 39:10.985
I um... I tried calling him...
but he,

39:11.018 --> 39:15.189
he didn't answer.

39:15.223 --> 39:16.924
You need to find him.

39:17.424 --> 39:20.194
I didn't call about Josh.

39:21.929 --> 39:24.364
What did you call to talk
about?

39:31.672 --> 39:33.241
Jake?

39:39.714 --> 39:41.282
I've had affairs.

39:44.451 --> 39:47.855
Nothing that meant anything at
all but...

39:51.859 --> 39:53.361
I've paid for sex.

39:57.397 --> 39:59.667
Do I need to get checked?

40:05.172 --> 40:06.007
No.

40:09.476 --> 40:13.413
Is there anything else you
want to say?

40:13.446 --> 40:17.652
Yeah, um, yeah, loads but,

40:18.485 --> 40:20.021
not over the phone and not now.

40:21.656 --> 40:23.824
We need to do it in person.

40:26.227 --> 40:32.600
Can we um... can we talk about it
when you get back from your sister's?

40:35.136 --> 40:35.970
Yeah.

40:47.014 --> 40:50.651
Congratulations, we
now move on to the next test,

40:50.685 --> 40:52.954
but a change of location is
required.

40:52.987 --> 40:55.823
We need absolute privacy
for what happens next.

41:48.242 --> 41:49.343
Now what?

41:49.377 --> 41:51.712
Next is the
penultimate test of your love

41:51.746 --> 41:53.314
for your child.

41:53.347 --> 41:57.018
How far are you willing to
go to save your son, Jake?

41:57.051 --> 41:58.452
I think you've seen that
already.

41:58.486 --> 42:00.688
Everything this
far has been prologue.

42:00.721 --> 42:04.725
The real test is will you
kill to save your child?

42:04.759 --> 42:06.994
Given the right circumstances.

42:07.028 --> 42:10.564
Easy to say, not so
easy to do.

42:10.598 --> 42:13.634
Jake, I need you to kill
the woman in the trunk

42:13.667 --> 42:15.536
to save your son's life.

42:22.476 --> 42:25.780
No, that doesn't have to
happen.

42:27.448 --> 42:30.418
Look, you've controlled me.
You've, you've broken me,

42:30.451 --> 42:34.655
you've proven every
point you have to prove.

42:37.324 --> 42:41.028
I'm a horrible father, a
horrible husband.

42:43.064 --> 42:44.465
You've made me realize that.

42:49.036 --> 42:51.205
But I don't have to kill
someone to prove it.

42:51.238 --> 42:53.207
I want to believe you,
Jake,

42:53.240 --> 42:56.043
I want to believe you really
mean all those things.

42:56.077 --> 42:59.246
But right now, you're scared
and you'll say anything

42:59.280 --> 43:01.148
to get out of this situation.

43:01.182 --> 43:04.318
No, I mean everything
I've said. You've broken me.

43:04.351 --> 43:06.754
You've won. Isn't that enough
for you?

43:06.787 --> 43:10.157
This is not for
me, Jake. This is for you.

43:10.191 --> 43:11.526
I won't kill her.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.228
What if I told you
she's directly responsible

43:14.261 --> 43:16.597
for everything that's happening
tonight?

43:18.365 --> 43:19.700
You've said that before.

43:21.936 --> 43:23.771
How is she responsible?

43:23.804 --> 43:26.941
I will tell you. But
not now.

43:26.974 --> 43:29.677
First, I need you to open the
glovebox.

43:37.985 --> 43:40.354
Open the black box.

43:55.537 --> 43:59.140
Now take the blue syringe
and inject the woman.

43:59.173 --> 44:01.342
This doesn't need to happen.

44:01.375 --> 44:05.045
It does, for your
sake it needs to happen.

44:10.985 --> 44:12.653
Anything but this.

44:16.423 --> 44:18.692
I'll give you all my money.

44:21.362 --> 44:24.533
I'll turn myself in to the
police.

44:24.566 --> 44:27.801
I'll confess to every
bad thing that I've done.

44:27.835 --> 44:31.939
I'll go, I'll go to jail
for as long as it takes.

44:32.940 --> 44:34.375
Just please don't make me do
this.

44:34.408 --> 44:36.010
Don't lose your
dignity, Jake,

44:36.043 --> 44:41.148
nobody likes a groveler. Take
control, own the situation.

44:41.182 --> 44:42.349
I don't want to own this,

44:42.383 --> 44:44.051
I don't want to own killing
someone.

44:44.084 --> 44:47.221
It's either
that, or your son dies.

44:47.254 --> 44:49.591
What's it going to be, Jake?

45:32.733 --> 45:34.636
There's got to be some other
way?

45:34.669 --> 45:36.638
Unless you inject that
woman,

45:36.671 --> 45:39.840
your son will die, right now.

46:30.424 --> 46:31.626
There you go, it's done.

46:31.660 --> 46:34.696
You did well, but
you closed the boot too soon.

46:34.729 --> 46:38.799
You need to reflect on the
consequences of your actions.

46:39.833 --> 46:41.902
No, I don't, I really don't.

46:41.935 --> 46:45.239
Yes, you do. It's
all part of the process.

46:45.272 --> 46:48.576
Don't let that woman's death
weigh on your conscience.

46:48.610 --> 46:52.514
I told you, if it weren't for
her, you wouldn't be here.

46:52.547 --> 46:54.915
Hey, yeah, you gonna tell me
who she is?

46:54.948 --> 46:59.521
Not yet. First, you
need to pass the next test.

46:59.554 --> 47:00.588
And what's that?

47:00.622 --> 47:02.856
No, you're not ready
yet.

47:02.890 --> 47:04.291
We're still on this test.

47:04.325 --> 47:07.428
You need to stand in front
of that woman's dead body

47:07.461 --> 47:12.433
and say to yourself, 'I did
this. I killed this woman.'

47:12.466 --> 47:14.001
You need to be able to
acknowledge

47:14.034 --> 47:16.904
and take responsibility for your
actions,

47:16.937 --> 47:20.675
no matter how deplorable
and despicable they are.

47:20.709 --> 47:22.376
If you can own her murder,

47:22.409 --> 47:27.915
there's nothing in your past
you won't be able to confront.

48:34.181 --> 48:35.182
It's done.

48:36.049 --> 48:37.852
Good.

48:40.020 --> 48:43.525
I've sent you a new
location for your final test.

48:43.558 --> 48:45.159
You know the drill.

49:12.554 --> 49:13.555
Why am I here?

49:13.588 --> 49:15.222
You don't recognize
it?

49:15.255 --> 49:17.958
Of course I do.
I proposed to Susan here.

49:18.225 --> 49:19.694
Makes this a fitting
location

49:19.727 --> 49:22.095
to carry out your final test.

49:22.129 --> 49:23.397
Jake} And what's that?

49:23.430 --> 49:25.767
You've killed
to save your son, Jake,

49:25.800 --> 49:28.770
but the ultimate test of a
parent's love

49:28.803 --> 49:34.509
is will you die to save your
child? This is your final test.

49:34.542 --> 49:37.211
What, you want me to
die?

49:37.244 --> 49:40.915
Yes. I want you
to take your own life.

49:41.916 --> 49:44.418
No, no, you're bluffing.

49:46.053 --> 49:49.223
No you need me alive.
See, if I kill myself,

49:49.256 --> 49:52.359
your game ends and you're
enjoying yourself far too much.

49:52.392 --> 49:53.595
You won't do it.

49:53.628 --> 49:55.462
I thought you would've
realized by now

49:55.496 --> 50:00.668
that this is no game. This is
for your benefit, not mine.

50:01.001 --> 50:05.005
How does my dying help my
son? Or me, for that matter?

50:05.038 --> 50:06.941
It proves your love
for him.

50:06.975 --> 50:09.243
There is no greater sacrifice.

50:09.276 --> 50:12.179
If I kill myself, I
can't do anything for him.

50:12.212 --> 50:14.181
I can't protect him from the
grave.

50:14.214 --> 50:17.852
Because you've done
such an amazing job alive.

50:17.886 --> 50:19.721
Your son tried to kill himself

50:19.754 --> 50:21.455
and you didn't even know about
it.

50:25.359 --> 50:26.828
Yeah, you're right.

50:29.029 --> 50:30.832
Look, I'm a terrible father.

50:31.198 --> 50:32.299
Right, I wasn't there for him.

50:32.332 --> 50:33.601
But if I make it out of this
alive,

50:33.635 --> 50:36.604
I will do everything I can
to make up for lost time.

50:36.638 --> 50:39.541
I want to believe
you Jake, I really do

50:39.574 --> 50:43.043
But you haven't changed
yet. Not completely.

50:43.912 --> 50:45.412
No, I have.

50:45.647 --> 50:47.080
No, you've changed
some,

50:47.114 --> 50:49.851
but not enough for the
effect to be lasting.

50:49.884 --> 50:53.053
I've no doubt that were I to
free you and Josh right now,

50:53.086 --> 50:55.088
you would try to keep your word.

50:55.122 --> 50:57.090
But it would only last a few
months

50:57.124 --> 50:59.994
before you slipped back
into your old ways.

51:00.028 --> 51:01.596
There is only one way for you

51:01.629 --> 51:04.097
to truly prove your love for
Josh.

51:05.432 --> 51:07.200
I won't kill myself.

51:07.234 --> 51:08.970
Such a shame, Jake.

51:09.003 --> 51:13.173
I really had high hopes for
you, you've come so far.

51:13.206 --> 51:17.110
Dad! Help? What
are you... Get off! Help!

51:17.144 --> 51:19.814
Stop, stop, stop.

51:24.919 --> 51:27.087
If I do this,

51:27.120 --> 51:29.557
what guarantees have I
got that you let Josh go?

51:29.591 --> 51:33.460
No guarantee Jake,
you just have to trust me.

51:34.696 --> 51:37.264
No, no, no, no, I need more
than that.

51:37.297 --> 51:39.232
I need to know that this is
going to end,

51:39.266 --> 51:41.836
that Josh goes free. You've
got to give me something.

51:41.869 --> 51:44.237
I can offer
no more than my word.

51:44.271 --> 51:46.741
But think back, since you've
known me,

51:46.774 --> 51:50.745
do you recall any moment I've
lied to you?

51:52.112 --> 51:54.381
How can I possibly know
if you've lied to me or not?

51:54.414 --> 51:55.717
If you think on it,

51:55.750 --> 51:59.152
you'll realize I've not once
deceived you.

51:59.186 --> 52:00.588
You have my word.

52:00.622 --> 52:05.158
I guarantee Josh will be freed
if you pass this final test.

52:05.192 --> 52:07.962
Take a moment to
think. It's a big decision.

52:07.996 --> 52:09.897
I'll call you back shortly.

53:23.203 --> 53:27.240
Time's up Jake. What's it going
to be?

53:28.910 --> 53:30.545
I need to speak to Josh.

53:30.578 --> 53:33.981
No, that would
stir far too many emotions.

53:34.015 --> 53:36.283
It's better you stay calm and
controlled

53:36.316 --> 53:38.586
when making this decision.

53:39.319 --> 53:41.122
Listen to me, if I'm going to
do this,

53:41.155 --> 53:42.790
I want to say goodbye.

53:42.824 --> 53:44.992
I'm not going to
stop you from doing that.

53:45.026 --> 53:47.327
But it's not going to
happen over the phone.

53:47.360 --> 53:50.297
Record a message on your
cell. You have my word.

53:50.330 --> 53:53.333
I'll give it to your son.
Then I'll set him free.

53:53.366 --> 53:54.836
You've got two minutes.

53:59.339 --> 54:01.008
Hey Josh.

54:04.779 --> 54:07.115
I don't know where to begin.

54:17.759 --> 54:18.826
I failed you.

54:21.863 --> 54:23.898
I failed you as a father.

54:25.566 --> 54:27.635
I failed you as a friend,

54:30.571 --> 54:33.975
as someone who's supposed to
protect you.

54:37.011 --> 54:39.446
I failed your mother as well.

54:49.857 --> 54:51.692
You're gonna have a lot of
questions.

54:55.229 --> 54:57.364
But whatever you do, don't blame
yourself.

54:59.399 --> 55:00.234
Or your mum.

55:07.875 --> 55:11.378
I'm doing this so you can live.

55:21.856 --> 55:25.159
I've ignored you for the past
ten years.

55:26.761 --> 55:29.063
And it's not until now that
I'm staring death in the face

55:29.096 --> 55:30.898
that I realize how much I messed
up.

55:35.002 --> 55:37.672
I should have been there for
you,

55:39.807 --> 55:43.711
every second, but I wasn't.

55:48.082 --> 55:53.120
And for that... I am truly
sorry.

55:57.158 --> 55:58.425
I love you.

56:30.858 --> 56:32.126
Done?

56:35.162 --> 56:35.997
Yes.

56:36.998 --> 56:39.834
Is this going to
happen?

56:45.773 --> 56:46.607
Jake?

56:48.910 --> 56:49.744
Yes.

56:51.411 --> 56:55.816
Take the second
syringe from the glovebox.

57:08.095 --> 57:10.031
Where do I inject it?

57:10.064 --> 57:11.699
Your thigh will work
fine.

57:15.269 --> 57:16.871
Is it going to hurt?

57:16.904 --> 57:19.240
It will make you
drowsy, then knock you out.

57:19.273 --> 57:21.208
The muscles in your
chest will stop working

57:21.242 --> 57:23.411
and you'll die of asphyxiation,

57:23.443 --> 57:27.248
but you'll be unconscious,
so you won't feel a thing.

57:33.321 --> 57:36.624
Do you promise to let
Josh go when I'm dead?

57:36.657 --> 57:40.493
I've said
already, you have my word.

57:46.233 --> 57:48.002
And the recording?

57:48.035 --> 57:50.271
Josh will see it.

1:00:21.689 --> 1:00:23.124
I saw you die.

1:00:24.725 --> 1:00:28.462
No, Jake,
you injected me with saline.

1:00:28.496 --> 1:00:30.565
You saw me fake my death.

1:00:32.700 --> 1:00:34.603
I'm surprised you didn't
make the connection

1:00:34.635 --> 1:00:36.904
after all the hints I gave you.

1:00:37.905 --> 1:00:39.640
No, I'm not going to
choose who you kill.

1:00:39.673 --> 1:00:41.642
I'm not going to kill
anyone,

1:00:41.675 --> 1:00:43.878
I'm as far from these people as
you are.

1:00:44.178 --> 1:00:47.081
I know what you look
like? When did we meet?

1:00:47.114 --> 1:00:48.382
Very recently.

1:00:49.450 --> 1:00:50.784
I won't kill her.

1:00:50.818 --> 1:00:51.986
What if I told you

1:00:52.019 --> 1:00:54.221
she's directly responsible for
everything

1:00:54.255 --> 1:00:55.524
that's happening tonight?

1:00:56.857 --> 1:00:59.860
Don't let that woman's death
weigh on your conscience.

1:00:59.894 --> 1:01:03.130
If it weren't for her,
you wouldn't be here.

1:01:04.398 --> 1:01:06.667
If you were in the boot the
whole time, where was my son?

1:01:06.700 --> 1:01:08.969
I took the liberty of
making some recordings

1:01:09.003 --> 1:01:11.305
I thought might be necessary.

1:01:11.338 --> 1:01:14.909
No, Dad! Help! Dad! No!

1:01:14.942 --> 1:01:16.210
Where is he now?

1:01:16.545 --> 1:01:18.212
He's very close, have
patience,

1:01:18.245 --> 1:01:23.217
you're soon to be reunited.
But before I let you go,

1:01:23.250 --> 1:01:25.554
I need to know that all the
tests you've passed tonight

1:01:25.587 --> 1:01:27.589
really have changed you for
good.

1:01:28.557 --> 1:01:30.057
I need to know you weren't just
pretending

1:01:30.090 --> 1:01:32.826
to be a better person to save
your son.

1:01:33.928 --> 1:01:36.330
I honestly thought I
was going to die tonight.

1:01:37.431 --> 1:01:39.066
What more do you want?

1:01:39.099 --> 1:01:42.803
You're right. You've
done incredibly well.

1:01:43.804 --> 1:01:46.307
And now you're ready
for your ultimate test.

1:01:52.547 --> 1:01:53.380
Pick it up.

1:01:59.554 --> 1:02:01.055
Aim it at me.

1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:08.597
Now, you have a decision to
make.

1:02:09.029 --> 1:02:11.600
Either you believe I helped
you become a better person,

1:02:11.633 --> 1:02:12.466
or you don't.

1:02:13.635 --> 1:02:15.537
If you believe me, you won't
shoot me.

1:02:17.204 --> 1:02:21.442
If you don't, you'll shoot me.

1:02:21.842 --> 1:02:24.345
This is your chance to judge me.

1:02:24.378 --> 1:02:26.247
How have I done, Jake?

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:29.283
Have I helped you for better? Or
worse?

1:02:31.418 --> 1:02:33.821
It's a very high-caliber gun,
Jake.

1:02:33.854 --> 1:02:37.224
Make sure you hold it tightly
so you can handle the recoil.

1:02:37.258 --> 1:02:39.527
If you shoot me from this
distance,

1:02:39.561 --> 1:02:42.296
those bullets are going to
tear right through my body.

1:02:58.846 --> 1:03:02.249
No, there's gotta be a catch.

1:03:04.619 --> 1:03:07.021
There's no way you'd just
let me shoot you like that.

1:03:07.988 --> 1:03:12.493
Well done, Jake. You
really have come a long way.

1:03:24.071 --> 1:03:25.774
I've done every thing
you've wanted me to do.

1:03:25.806 --> 1:03:28.576
I've passed all your tests,
now get these chains off me

1:03:28.610 --> 1:03:29.744
and give me back my son.

1:03:29.778 --> 1:03:32.980
If I let you go, do you
promise to be rational?

1:03:33.347 --> 1:03:35.149
Do you promise not to attack me?

1:03:36.016 --> 1:03:36.850
Yes.

1:03:37.885 --> 1:03:40.087
Don't make me regret this
Jake.

1:04:08.650 --> 1:04:10.384
Josh, Josh? Hey? Hey?

1:04:14.254 --> 1:04:15.790
What's wrong with him?

1:04:15.824 --> 1:04:19.594
He's sedated. He'll
wake up in an hour or so.

1:04:22.630 --> 1:04:25.299
What's stopping me from
killing you now?

1:04:25.332 --> 1:04:28.302
Nothing, Jake, only you.

1:04:28.335 --> 1:04:32.239
Of all the people in the
world, why me?

1:04:32.272 --> 1:04:36.210
Everyone needs a savior.
Chance would have it I'm yours.

1:04:36.243 --> 1:04:38.212
Chance had nothing to do with
it.

1:04:40.047 --> 1:04:41.382
If there's one thing
I've learned tonight,

1:04:41.415 --> 1:04:45.520
everything you do has a reason.
You've put me through hell,

1:04:45.553 --> 1:04:49.256
but I've survived. I passed
every single one of your tests.

1:04:50.124 --> 1:04:53.894
So you tell me why? Why me?

1:04:53.927 --> 1:04:55.797
Ignorance is bliss, Jake.

1:04:56.664 --> 1:04:58.332
Tell me!

1:04:59.701 --> 1:05:03.036
My father killed himself
because you preyed on him.

1:05:03.538 --> 1:05:06.039
I don't prey on people.

1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:08.843
I don't prey on people.

1:05:08.877 --> 1:05:10.712
That's all you do.

1:05:10.745 --> 1:05:11.846
You've made a career

1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:14.181
of exploiting other
people's vulnerabilities

1:05:14.214 --> 1:05:16.083
to your own end.

1:05:16.116 --> 1:05:20.154
What I do is only ever
business, it's never personal.

1:05:20.187 --> 1:05:23.792
Try telling that to
the family of Vince Bullham.

1:05:25.325 --> 1:05:27.027
Vince was disturbed.

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:29.430
You're right, he was,

1:05:29.463 --> 1:05:31.165
but that didn't stop you from
conning him

1:05:31.198 --> 1:05:32.801
out of his life savings.

1:05:37.505 --> 1:05:40.207
I was fifteen years old
when my father killed himself

1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:42.577
because of what you did to him.

1:05:44.913 --> 1:05:46.614
I hated you for it.

1:05:47.314 --> 1:05:50.083
All I wanted to do was kill you.

1:05:51.018 --> 1:05:55.022
But I wasn't stupid. I took my
time,

1:05:55.055 --> 1:05:58.793
followed you, waiting for
the perfect opportunity,

1:05:58.827 --> 1:05:59.661
and it came.

1:06:01.094 --> 1:06:03.197
And you didn't see me coming.

1:06:03.731 --> 1:06:06.099
And the police would never
have linked it to me.

1:06:09.403 --> 1:06:11.205
But I couldn't do it.

1:06:12.206 --> 1:06:14.374
I realized that in all
this time watching you,

1:06:14.408 --> 1:06:16.611
that I'd come to pity you.

1:06:17.745 --> 1:06:19.948
And that killing you
wouldn't change anything.

1:06:22.115 --> 1:06:23.818
But I still wanted you to
suffer.

1:06:25.986 --> 1:06:29.924
I wanted you to feel what he
felt.

1:06:30.390 --> 1:06:32.025
What I feel.

1:06:32.493 --> 1:06:34.696
But I wanted your
suffering to have purpose.

1:06:35.964 --> 1:06:41.669
I thought that if I could
change you, if I could save you,

1:06:42.837 --> 1:06:45.507
then that would give his death
meaning.

1:06:46.006 --> 1:06:49.076
I'm very fucking sorry
your father killed himself,

1:06:51.111 --> 1:06:51.946
I really am.

1:06:56.416 --> 1:07:01.154
But that doesn't justify what
you did to me and my son.

1:07:01.188 --> 1:07:03.591
What you've put us through.

1:07:03.625 --> 1:07:05.325
If you honestly don't think

1:07:05.359 --> 1:07:07.027
that everything I've
put you through tonight

1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:09.363
has changed you for the
better, then I failed,

1:07:09.396 --> 1:07:11.666
and you may as well shoot me.
