WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:13.555
[sirens wailing]

00:29.529 --> 00:33.074
[Sebastian] It was
the same dream I've had
ever since I was a child.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.868
It still scares me.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.327
[Rachel] I won't judge.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.622
[Sebastian] It always starts
the same way.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.126
I'm on this empty train,
going through a dark tunnel,

00:43.209 --> 00:44.794
but it's endless.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.757
Just a void of nothing.

00:50.091 --> 00:53.011
And so, I start screaming.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.348
I scream for my mother.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.977
But she doesn't come.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.897
No one comes.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.816
And I'm so alone,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.903
and all I want
is to get off this train.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.866
But... But I can't.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.994
I know I'm awake now,

01:19.078 --> 01:21.164
but this feels the same.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.958
Feels like
I'm on that train, Rachel,

01:24.042 --> 01:25.877
and there is no stopping it.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.630
Yeah, I know how you feel.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.677
But in the dream,
you don't get a choice.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.472
You do have
a choice, Sebastian.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.268
I don't even know what I am.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.817
My entire life,
I thought I was nothing.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.071
Or maybe, it's worse.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.784
Maybe, I'm just...

01:58.451 --> 01:59.619
What?

02:01.913 --> 02:02.914
Damned.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.710
I'm a child of Trigon too.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.255
I made the choice
to become a Titan.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.633
Because you do get a choice.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.427
And you'll make the right one.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.515
I know you will.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.392
You're my big bro, after all.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.489
All right.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.617
Just six hours
to keep Sebastian
away from that witch,

02:39.701 --> 02:42.120
and we are home free.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.706
Or, we're living through
the end of days.

02:45.915 --> 02:46.958
Cool.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.921
[Bernard] You could afford
to be more optimistic.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.132
[Tim] Yeah,
but that would be lying.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.434
Oh.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.779
[footsteps approaching]

03:16.863 --> 03:19.741
[The Confessor] Mother,
we found the dissenter.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.214
Hello, Raymond.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.344
You seem troubled.

03:39.427 --> 03:43.056
Go ahead, tell her
what you told the others.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.519
You're safe here. Speak.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.521
The others are worried.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.900
Why?

03:53.983 --> 03:57.111
The blood moon has risen,
and we've not seen our brother.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.659
What is my flock saying?

04:02.742 --> 04:04.619
That our long wait
has been in vain.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.289
Never speak
to our mother that way!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.877
You are afraid.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.171
But have faith.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.887
I have waited
much longer than you
for this moment.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.683
Longer than anyone, really.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.981
I have sacrificed my very self
to be reunited with my son.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.943
So...

04:37.610 --> 04:38.653
Yes.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.698
He will be brought home.

04:54.752 --> 05:00.758
[Mother Mayhem]
Azarath. Metrion. Zinthos.

05:20.319 --> 05:21.696
[screeches]

05:29.495 --> 05:31.581
[theme music playing]

05:45.762 --> 05:47.930
[Tim] All clear.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.515
All clear.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.976
All clear.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.438
Wow, look over there!

05:55.521 --> 05:57.982
It's an empty hallway again.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.984
Why don't you say "All clear"
one more time?

06:01.527 --> 06:03.488
It was, really, such
a delightful phrase.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.783
It's so obvious Dick's
putting me on ice.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.744
"Everyone with no skills,
go hide behind the monitors."

06:09.827 --> 06:10.870
No offense.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.455
I think you meant
a little offense.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.875
Alternative take?

06:15.958 --> 06:18.127
Dick knows that
being a "super" involves

06:18.211 --> 06:20.254
deep commitment and sacrifice,

06:20.338 --> 06:23.841
and he just needs to know
it's what you want
before you jump in.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.426
Yeah.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.097
For what it's worth,
I believe in you.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.642
You'll know your moment
when it comes

06:36.395 --> 06:37.688
What?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.732
In Gotham, it felt like
I was on the ground.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.401
Making a difference.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.322
Now I'm just dodging
VR nunchucks.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.992
It's like they're on the PS5
and I'm stuck on the Wii.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.204
Wow, okay, that
actually was really offensive.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.081
-I worked hard
on those nunchucks.
-Wait, wait, wait.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.377
Do you have any
experiments here
that involve snakes?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.630
No.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.841
[Tim] Wasn't it a snake
that killed Lex Luthor?

07:04.924 --> 07:06.425
[Bernard] Yes.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.846
Then that's what I call
suspicious activity.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.223
-Tim, no.
-Come on.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.808
Tim. Oh, God.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.102
No, no. Tim, stop!

07:18.980 --> 07:21.732
-Tim!
-Yeah.

07:21.816 --> 07:26.070
What are you gonna do?
Um, catch it like it's Ekans?

07:26.154 --> 07:30.533
A first gen Pokemon reference.
You really are a geek.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.868
Thank you.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.871
I'm so ready for some action,
I'm telling you.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.289
[snake growling]

07:41.919 --> 07:43.379
[Tim] Oh...

07:44.630 --> 07:46.090
[both yelp]

07:48.134 --> 07:50.469
Get up! Get up!

07:50.553 --> 07:53.431
Go, go, go! To the left!
Tim, to the left!

07:56.601 --> 07:57.935
[lock engaging]

07:58.019 --> 07:59.312
[both panting]

08:08.571 --> 08:10.948
That was way too close.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.909
The thing was enormous.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.620
It went by the door, and then
we lost it on the monitors.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.456
But we definitely saw it
in the north hallway.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.626
I'm going to have
a lifetime of nightmares now.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.837
I would be bathing in
that thing's digestive enzymes,
if it weren't for Tim.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.506
-Thanks, for the visual.
-[Tim] I should have
tried to kill it.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.633
That would've been a bad idea.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.967
[Dick] Or a fatal one.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.720
This is magic.
We're in Jinx's world now.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.347
What's your take on this?

08:34.430 --> 08:38.267
Well, a snake is
that crazy lady's
signature move, right?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.936
Could have been the same
snake that killed Lex.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.563
How did the snake get
inside of S.T.A.R. Labs?

08:42.647 --> 08:45.274
We had every inch
of this place covered.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.152
[Jinx] Doesn't
matter now, does it?
The point is that it's here.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.948
And Mommy's gonna
use that snake to get
what she really wants.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.533
Which is Sebastian.
So how do we stop this thing?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.745
Well, I am gonna have to
consult the only person

08:57.828 --> 09:00.623
capable of handling a snake
of this magnitude.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.834
Samuel L. Jackson.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.461
[chuckles]

09:05.544 --> 09:08.839
-Jinx. Focus, please.
-Okay, okay.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.591
It's magic versus magic, right?

09:10.675 --> 09:15.012
So, if you catch this thing,
I will magic your little snake.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.305
So not little.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.642
Then, I will magic your
enormous snake.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.143
Happy now?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.145
Make cowboy boots
out of the thing,
for all I care.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.439
Let's find it. Kory,
you and I on the west wing.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.483
Gar and Jinx, take the east.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.195
Conner, guard the silo
and make sure
nothing gets to Sebastian.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.406
Okay.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.533
-Tim and Bernard--
-Let me guess.
Security monitors.

09:36.575 --> 09:38.077
Yeah. For now.

09:45.209 --> 09:50.548
[Gar] Well, hypothetically,
yes, I have turned into
a snake before, I think.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.009
[Jinx] Okay, great.
So, our superior plan

09:53.092 --> 09:55.344
is that you are gonna
turn into a snake,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.263
then, you're gonna
make the snake
fall in love with you,

09:57.346 --> 09:59.849
and then you're not
gonna text the snake back.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.517
[Gar] Ghost the ghost snake.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.477
[Jinx] Yeah,
then it'll be like,
"Fuck you, Snake."

10:03.561 --> 10:04.687
[both chuckle]

10:07.648 --> 10:10.735
Hey, can I, uh...
Can I ask you something?

10:10.818 --> 10:12.611
Yeah, spill.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.905
You know about magic...

10:14.989 --> 10:17.366
My guild card came in
the post last week.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.578
[Gar sighs]
This is gonna sound crazy.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.748
I hope so.
I am getting bored.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.793
[Gar sighs]
A tree of bones
tried to talk to me.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.880
Whoa. Tried, or did?

10:32.131 --> 10:33.007
Did.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.508
Okay.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.178
Did this tree of bones
happen to be under a red sky?

10:37.261 --> 10:38.679
Yeah.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.556
Yeah, that place has a name.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.185
The Red.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.605
Underwhelming and unoriginal.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.898
[chuckles] Yeah.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.149
What else do you know?

10:50.232 --> 10:52.735
Ugh, not much, really,
just rumors.

10:52.818 --> 10:59.241
"It's a place of
great power and mystery."
You know, rumor-ey stuff.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.952
It's really starting to
freak me out, Jinx.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.622
I don't know
why I keep seeing it
or what it wants from me--

11:04.705 --> 11:08.417
Ugh, Gar, only
the most boring people

11:08.501 --> 11:10.461
need to know what's
at the other end.

11:10.544 --> 11:14.215
Can't you see that this
is a gift?

11:14.298 --> 11:17.468
Sometimes, you just
have to go in blind
and figure it out.

11:20.805 --> 11:21.889
Oh, my God.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.520
Hey. Are you all right?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.438
Dude?

11:30.564 --> 11:33.526
Okay, buddy. You all right?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.406
[Jinx] Oh! Oh, my God.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.703
[Gar over radio]
We found a dead guy.
The snake ate his face off!

11:44.787 --> 11:47.706
-Guys, this is really bad.
-[groans]

11:47.790 --> 11:50.126
Be careful, you do not wanna
mess with this thing.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.378
[groaning]

11:56.549 --> 11:57.633
[rustling]

11:58.759 --> 11:59.718
[snake hisses]

12:08.352 --> 12:10.229
I'm sensing a theme here.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.898
Dick really needs to
talk to someone about
the Titans' merchandising.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.693
I... I can barely find a mug.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.490
Hey, how's life on the outside?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.826
Oh, everything's totally fine.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.578
Dick asked me to
take over for you, Rachel.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.246
He figured you could
use a break.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.498
Oh.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.167
Okay. That's nice of him.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.502
Um... Do you want anything,
like, chips or something?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.212
Uh, yeah. Okay.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.382
Yeah? And don't play Monopoly
without me. It is going to be--

12:38.466 --> 12:40.468
Super. Yeah. Got it.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.677
Yeah.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.348
Take your time.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.516
Okay.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.612
-[Kory] This feels wrong.
-[Dick] Wrong, how?

12:59.695 --> 13:02.281
Things would play out
differently on Tamaran.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.699
What do you mean?

13:03.782 --> 13:06.410
My people would embrace
the uglier option.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.830
We may need to
reconsider things.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.042
Sebastian is right here.
We may never have
this chance again.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.586
So you wanna take out
the one guy who spent
this whole time protecting--

13:15.669 --> 13:18.047
Well, that book was very clear.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.633
-So, if the prophecy is right--
-So, we should all just do

13:20.716 --> 13:22.635
what this picture says?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.678
Look, we've had it worse
with Rachel.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.055
We'll do the same thing
with Sebastian.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.432
Mmm-hmm.
What if Sebastian is not like--

13:28.516 --> 13:30.059
Rachel?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.894
Hey, do you guys have,
like, five dollars?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.854
What the hell are you doing?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.231
Getting chips.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.149
Why, you patrolling
my sodium intake now?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.400
Where is Sebastian?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.444
In the silo with Conner,
like you wanted.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.737
We wanted?

13:41.820 --> 13:44.323
Yeah. You sent him there to
give me a break?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.494
What's going on?

13:48.577 --> 13:50.913
I thought that it was
safer for me at the silo?

13:50.996 --> 13:54.583
It was.
But Dick thinks there's
an even safer place for you.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.668
I'm taking you there now.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.587
That's good. So, where is it?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.507
Nearby. Outside.
We just need to
leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.094
Actually, uh, look.
I would feel a lot better

14:05.177 --> 14:07.429
if we could just go back
to the silo.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.474
Or I, I can go back myself.
I bet Dick wouldn't even mind.

14:10.558 --> 14:14.478
But you can't.
Everybody's waiting for you.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.189
Who?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.483
The Titans?

14:24.697 --> 14:25.781
[voice distorts] My son.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.409
Oh, my God.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.036
You get more beautiful
every time I see you.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.374
I would never
take you by force.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.336
You already know the words.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.921
I'm here to warn you.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.507
Do not trust the Titans.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.968
They mean to harm you.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.306
And I would hate
to see you die--

14:50.389 --> 14:52.766
Conner, what's going on?

14:57.062 --> 15:00.399
Dick, just walk away.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.736
Why don't we take
a minute to sit down
and just cool off a little bit?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.656
I feel perfectly cool, Dick.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.619
When I told you to walk away,

15:13.329 --> 15:14.330
I meant it.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.374
Conner, stop!

15:22.921 --> 15:26.467
Look, this shit
isn't magic, okay?

15:26.550 --> 15:28.802
Well, technically it is.
But what I mean is,

15:28.886 --> 15:32.264
we've only got three minutes
until this guy is up
and at it again.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.902
[sirens wailing in distance]

15:51.283 --> 15:55.037
I know that was a close call,
but we will protect you.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.997
[Sebastian] Is that
really true, though?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.583
Because I obviously wasn't
safe at S.T.A.R. Labs.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.378
And that woman told me
I wasn't safe with you, either,

16:02.461 --> 16:04.296
that I was gonna get killed.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.840
Yes, you weren't safe.
Which is why I got you
the hell out of there.

16:07.966 --> 16:12.304
We will figure this out.
I promise.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.934
It'll be all right.
You can trust Kory
with your life.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.644
I did.

16:22.898 --> 16:27.778
[Kory] I know
you have questions.
We do too.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.740
We just need
to buy some time
to get some answers.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.033
[phone dings]

16:35.327 --> 16:38.247
Hey. Elko Diner.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.334
Okay, Universe. We hear you.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.712
Who's in the mood for pancakes?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.262
Dick, we may be in
over our heads, man.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.763
Look, she was able
to summon a beast

16:54.847 --> 16:56.598
inside the most
secure lab
on the planet.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.350
Who knows
what she's done to Conner

16:58.434 --> 17:00.436
and how much time
we have left until
the end of the world.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.605
Five hours and 15 minutes.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.151
And the world is
not ending, okay?

17:07.234 --> 17:09.194
I told Kory we'd get
through this, and we will.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.365
Where did she take him?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.451
Don't worry about her.
She's taking care of Sebastian.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.994
We've gotta take care of this.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.622
Give me some time with Conner.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.421
Hey, Dick.

17:27.504 --> 17:30.090
[Conner] Sorry about before.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.259
I guess things got
a little heated.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.429
That's an understatement.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.639
Hey, what do you say we
take these cuffs off?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.600
The kryptonite stays on.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.977
Hmm. That's disappointing.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.024
Don't worry about that.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.450
-Jesus.
-[Conner groans]
Don't resist.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.828
We all keep fighting
and fighting.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.996
Maybe...

18:01.079 --> 18:03.415
Maybe, now's
the time to let go.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.667
[snarls and laughs]

18:09.087 --> 18:10.506
What's the matter?
You scared?

18:11.882 --> 18:13.050
[laughs]

18:20.307 --> 18:22.768
[people chattering
indistinctly]

18:22.851 --> 18:24.186
[bell tinkles]

18:28.857 --> 18:31.819
I can't believe they've got
one of these in Metropolis.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.530
Yeah, it turns out, it's not
just a metaphysical diner,

18:34.613 --> 18:35.948
but a chain, too.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.242
Metaphysical?
So, it'll protect me?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.578
Yeah, I, uh, hope so.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.996
[Sebastian] I'm sorry,
but I'm just not seeing

18:43.080 --> 18:45.082
how a milkshake is gonna
save my life.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.875
Isn't there somewhere else
we can go?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.753
Like a witness
protection thing?
Or a different country?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.672
I've always wanted
to go to Bimini.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.048
Just give me a second.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.720
Hi, you two.
Right this way.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.314
[pop music playing]

19:15.612 --> 19:16.697
[machine whirring]

19:28.876 --> 19:30.127
There we go.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.548
Koriand'r.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.716
Zadira.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.848
You brought us here.

19:44.182 --> 19:45.517
Why?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
We don't have much time.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.694
We will find him
soon enough, Mother.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.654
We'll bring your son home.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.036
Uh, I can't feel him.
It's just nothing. It's empty.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.415
We have located Sebastian.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.209
Where?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.587
A place that
none of us can reach.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.801
You're not safe here.
Not until you gain

20:19.885 --> 20:21.094
enough power
for the coming war with--

20:21.178 --> 20:23.305
Trigon. I know.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.682
Are you done?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.225
I see, I'm still not
allowed to interrupt.

20:27.309 --> 20:31.146
You were always a wise pupil.
Keep it that way.

20:32.064 --> 20:32.981
Pupil?

20:33.815 --> 20:35.651
I'll fill you in later.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.487
There's no time.
The shield around this place
will only last so long.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.324
And the evil woman will
certainly come to claim
what is hers.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.618
She's talking about me.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.037
Don't listen to her.
You're not "hers."

20:47.120 --> 20:50.624
He is. That is
precisely the problem.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.292
And the forces
working with Trigon

20:52.376 --> 20:54.503
will stop at nothing
to assure his ascension.

20:54.586 --> 20:59.633
Not if Sebastian has a say.
And he doesn't have to do
anything he doesn't want to.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.761
[Zadira] He won't be able
to resist his destiny.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.097
No one can.

21:05.180 --> 21:08.892
We just have to keep him safe
until the blood moon passes.

21:08.976 --> 21:13.021
This naive optimism
is... touching.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.524
And from where
is the source?

21:15.607 --> 21:16.942
The cult's book.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.860
We found that
it details the prophecy.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.197
He can only rise to power
while the blood moon
is still in the sky.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.034
And what makes you think
that you can save him
from his mother,

21:26.118 --> 21:28.286
when you barely
understand your capabilities,

21:28.370 --> 21:32.374
let alone your responsibilities
to people of Tamaran?

21:32.457 --> 21:33.917
I owe them nothing.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.462
I fulfilled my mission.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.257
Rachel defeated Trigon.
The prophecy was denied.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.508
As will this one.

21:41.591 --> 21:44.094
You did nothing
to change the girl.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.054
The change was already in her.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.683
You were merely a spectator
to destiny running its course.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.727
That's not true.
Kory helped me.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.272
You know,
we don't have to listen to her.
We can just leave.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.274
Do so at your own peril.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.986
But you know
you won't be able
to protect them.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.574
I can't save anyone
on an empty stomach.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.909
Kitchen.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.628
[Mother Mayhem]
Great Trigon. Please.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.256
Speak to me.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.885
I'm begging you.

22:24.968 --> 22:29.473
Our son was taken away
by the Tamaranean
to a place I cannot enter.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.932
I need your guidance.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.227
Forgive me. Forgive me!

22:36.104 --> 22:37.773
Forgive me.
You have forsaken me.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.817
You have forsaken me,
when I need you!
I need our son!

22:47.783 --> 22:49.951
-[scoffs]
-[bubbling]

22:50.035 --> 22:51.870
Trigon, you're here?

22:53.955 --> 22:58.585
Oh. Your Grace, thank you,
for heeding me.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.420
[bubbling intensifies]

23:02.380 --> 23:03.548
That's not true.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.593
I love none more
than I love you.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.931
I'm sorry.

23:11.014 --> 23:14.351
I never meant to
place anyone above my Lord.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.855
What should I do?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.692
[bubbling]

23:25.821 --> 23:26.905
I understand.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.162
Someone always pays.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.921
[computer] Probability
of organ failure, 80%.

23:43.004 --> 23:47.425
Dick, please, please don't
let me die like this.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.637
Hey, it's gonna be okay, buddy.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.349
I'm so scared.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.687
[Dick] I understand.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.689
We're not going anywhere.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.065
Okay. Okay.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.401
I want you to hear me.
We're gonna save you.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.571
Okay, you're gonna save me.
You're gonna save me.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.614
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.324
Where have I heard that before?

24:12.450 --> 24:14.703
Oh. Oh, right.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.037
[chuckles]

24:16.121 --> 24:17.789
Why don't we just ask Hank?

24:17.873 --> 24:19.541
That's what you said
to him, right?

24:19.624 --> 24:20.876
Right before he died, right?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.795
-Put him under.
-Oh, come on. Come on.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.213
[grunting indistinctly]

24:25.297 --> 24:26.882
Listen, we got to get
that thing out of him.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.093
-Tell me you got something.
-Well, that's no snake.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.887
That is a curse.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.431
So, we need
a magical expulsion,
which I've never done before.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.849
And if it goes wrong...

24:37.350 --> 24:39.811
Well, uh, I think
you can guess.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.147
But for it to work,
I'd need my blue ash.

24:42.230 --> 24:46.568
It's from the ground up teeth
of a Baba Yaga,
a John Constantine special.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.486
Then we go with that.
We have no choice.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.488
-I can't.
-Why?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.991
Well, because we need to
get close enough to that snake
to fight it directly

24:53.074 --> 24:57.078
and we can't rouse
its defenses.
It's a total fortress.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.538
Then how do we get
in the fortress?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.418
The Trojan horse.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.003
A man on the inside.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.130
We need something
small enough
to get into his body

25:07.214 --> 25:08.298
and stay undetected.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.633
Like a virus?

25:09.716 --> 25:12.010
But a virus smart enough
to target only the snake.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.806
Huh.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.435
What?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.915
Trigon has spoken to you.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.382
You understand
I don't want to do this.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.516
You must be strong
for both of us.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.397
[Gina] You forgave me for
what I did to you.

26:20.620 --> 26:25.709
And you have been
by my side since,
despite everything.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.840
Loyal, trustworthy...

26:33.758 --> 26:37.095
your strength has guided me
through the darkest times.

26:38.930 --> 26:42.517
And now it is time
to bring Sebastian
to his rightful place.

26:51.693 --> 26:52.777
Quickly, please.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.089
[gurgling]

27:16.551 --> 27:19.512
I will honor your sacrifice
forever. I swear.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.731
[Gar] Okay,
here's the big idea.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.901
I turn into to a virus.
Any questions?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.236
I have plenty.
Let's start with the basics.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.738
I thought you could
only turn into animals.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.616
Well, technically,
Niles Caulder said

27:39.699 --> 27:42.994
that I could unzip
and rearrange my DNA
into anything

27:43.078 --> 27:44.704
as long as it has DNA

27:44.788 --> 27:47.582
And viruses are actually
the most primordial
form of DNA,

27:47.665 --> 27:50.001
so technically it should work.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.419
"Should"?

27:51.503 --> 27:54.589
Theoretically, uh, the idea
would be that Gar's virus

27:54.672 --> 27:57.717
becomes a carrier agent
for Jinx's blue ash.

28:01.805 --> 28:05.558
So, Gar, as a virus,
gets inside Conner's body,

28:05.642 --> 28:07.519
replicates,
infects the snake...

28:07.602 --> 28:10.188
And boom! Conner lives.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.194
What?

28:19.155 --> 28:21.950
If Conner dies, so does Gar.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.202
A virus can't live
outside a dead host.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.291
And...

28:30.375 --> 28:32.335
-There's more?
-And...

28:32.419 --> 28:35.130
We haven't exactly
figured out
an exit strategy for me

28:35.213 --> 28:37.424
once I'm actually
in Conner's body,

28:37.507 --> 28:39.676
so I could kinda get stuck.

28:46.683 --> 28:47.851
Come with me.

28:56.609 --> 28:58.653

is on the line.

It will.
It just needs to replicate.

No. I'm praying.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.918
He's there.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.088
Right. Now he just needs
to infect the snake.

about the end of the world?

the destruction
