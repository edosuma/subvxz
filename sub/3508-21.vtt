Good evening, Detective Beckett.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

02:47.200 --> 02:48.600
Victim's name is Paul Finch.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.400
According to the registration,
it's his car.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.500
What do we know about him?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.300
ESPOSITO: We ran him for next of kin,
found his wife.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.400
RYAN: She's on her way in.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.800
And his rap sheet.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.400
He's a thief.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.300
Couple of bank jobs,
some corporate B and E's.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.800
But he hasn't been arrested
in a few years.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.100
So he's either really lucky...

03:03.100 --> 03:05.000
- Or he's out of the game.
- What happened?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.600
I'd say he was electrocuted.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.300
That had to be pretty high voltage
for him to get burns lhis that.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.500
Sure. You connect these leads directly
into the ignition system,

03:12.500 --> 03:13.900
you rev the engine high enough...

03:14.000 --> 03:15.300
BECKETT: Looks like they were
trying to torture him,

03:15.300 --> 03:16.900
but ended up killing him instead.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.800
Either way, it wasn't pleasant.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.900
You know, whoever did this

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
either wanted to send a message
or needed something from him.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
What would somebody need
from a retired...

03:28.600 --> 03:29.800
What?

03:29.900 --> 03:31.800
His eyes are closed.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.500
Did anyone touch the body
before you came here?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.400
Nope. It was like that when I got here.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.300
The killer must have closed them
postmortem.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.400
- That means he knew our victim.
- That means he knew the victim.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.000
I would say, he probably felt guilty
about what he had done,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.300
wanted to erase it.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.600
Have CSU sweep the cars,
and let's fume the body.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.700
Maybe we'll get some prints
off of his eyelids.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.200
You got it.

CASTLE: What is it?

04:01.300 --> 04:02.600
You tell me.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.800
Maybe he was murdered by
The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.400
BECKETT: Mrs. Finch,
we're very sorry for your loss.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.000
Does this look familiar to you at all?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.600
No, I'm sorry.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.700
Look, I know what my husband was,

04:17.800 --> 04:20.899
but Paul had been out of the game
since he left prison.

04:20.899 --> 04:24.200
When we got married,
he swore off taking scores.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.700
Then a few weeks ago, he said
he had to go do something for a friend.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
Did he tell you what or who?

04:29.800 --> 04:30.800
No.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.700
I begged him not to do it, but he...

04:33.700 --> 04:36.300
He said he owed the guy
from way back.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.300
Paul was a thief, Detective,
but he had this sense of honor.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.000
He was old-fashioned like that.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.400
He was a good man, Detective.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.800
I mean,
God knows he had his faults, but...

04:49.800 --> 04:51.300
This?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.400
He didn't deserve this.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.500
So the guy comes out of retirement
for one job and ends up dead.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.700
That cannot be a coincidence.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.800
Yeah, what lures a guy

05:03.900 --> 05:05.500
who's been retired for years
back into the game?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.700
Must've been something big.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.200
BECKETT: That was Robbery
on the phone.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.700
They logged in a break-in
at a branch of Manhattan Mutual

05:10.700 --> 05:11.900
the day before yesterday.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.400
Bank heist.
That fits with Finch's profile.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.600
Did they have any details?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.700
Nope. They're sending
the new guy up now.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.300
And that would be me.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.800
ESPOSITO: Oh!

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
- What's up, bro?
- How you doing?

05:22.500 --> 05:23.900
Why didn't you tell me you transferred?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.200
You know, I've been settling in.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.500
Hey, uh, this is my boy, Tom Demming.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.800
He was one of the best cops
back at the 54th.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.900
This is my partner, Ryan.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.600
- How you doing? You, too.
- Nice to meet you, man.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.200
- ESPOSITO: Richard Castle.
- Yeah, the author, right?

05:34.300 --> 05:35.300
That's right.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.700
And this is Detective Beckett.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.300
- Yeah, we met.
- Yes. Hi.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.400
Hi.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.700
(CHUCKLES) So, Paul Finch, huh?

05:43.700 --> 05:46.300
He's one of the few guys on the island
who could've taken a score like that.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
Like what?

05:47.400 --> 05:51.000
A couple of pros tunnel into the vault,
drill open a safe deposit box,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.200
leave nothing behind
but the great smell of Brut.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.000
And you think that Finch couldn't have
pulled this off on his own?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No, it was a two-man job
at the minimum.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.600
There's definitely another player
floating around out there.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.100
We've run a search
for his phone records and financials,

06:03.100 --> 06:05.500
so hopefully we'll find something
that ties him to a partner.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.800
Or maybe the partner
turned on Finch after the robbery,

06:07.900 --> 06:09.600
decided he didn't need him anymore.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.900
Either way, we know that the robbery
and the homicide are connected.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.800
That seems like an awful lot of trouble
for one safe deposit box.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.500
Yeah.
And they left stacks of cash untouched.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.000
The guys downstairs thought I was nuts
when I hopped on this case,

06:21.100 --> 06:22.700
but I like the weird ones.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.600
Hmm. How about that?
Beckett likes the weird ones, too.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.100
Yeah.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.300
What could be in that box

06:28.300 --> 06:31.000
that'd be worth digging
a tunnel to and killing for?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.100
Diamonds? German bearer bonds?
Nazi gold?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.400
DEMMING: We still don't know yet.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.100
The bank had some trouble
locating the owner,

06:37.200 --> 06:39.400
but he's supposed to be
coming in this afternoon.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.100
Would you like to join me
for the interrogation?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.500
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.600
Good.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.300
Meanwhile, I'm gonna need you guys
to hit the street

06:45.300 --> 06:47.300
and see if you can scare up
any of Finch's associates.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.400
Maybe anyone
that he's taken scores with in the past

06:49.500 --> 06:52.400
or people that he owes. Thank you.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.900
You got it.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.100
What can I do?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
You could watch.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.000

we're going to do everything we can

07:08.700 --> 07:11.000
to help you recover
your stolen property.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.500
What exactly was in the box?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.900
Stamps.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.000
- Stamps?
- Yeah, I collect them.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.600
It kind of surprises me
it took you so long to reach out to us.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.100
The folks at the bank said
they left you a half a dozen messages

07:22.100 --> 07:23.800
over the last couple of days.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.400
Well, I been busy, you know?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.700
I been working a lot.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.300
And what is it that you do?

07:28.300 --> 07:30.600
I'm in private security.

07:31.700 --> 07:35.200
This stamp collection,
how much was it worth exactly?

07:35.300 --> 07:37.800
It's hard to put a price tag
on an item like that

07:37.900 --> 07:41.100
because of, you know,
the sentimental value.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.300
And who else knew
that you were keeping it at the bank?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.500
Just a select group
of other stamp enthusiasts

07:46.600 --> 07:50.600
with whom I formed relationships
over the years.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.500
So how long you been
a philatelist, Fred?

07:52.500 --> 07:56.200
Hey, watch your mouth, pal.
Fred Cana don't go that route.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.200
Philately is the study of stamps,
Mr. Cana,

07:59.200 --> 08:02.700
which you would know if you were,
in fact, a collector.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.000
Come on, Fred.
What's really in the box, huh?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.300
What'd they steal from you?

08:07.300 --> 08:10.500
I don't have to take this crap.
I'm the victim here.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.400
RYAN: Hey.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.500
Hey, you guys rounding up
the usual suspects?

Yeah, and every hood
this side of Harlem

for years.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
Where's Beckett?

08:20.600 --> 08:23.500
Oh, she and Captain America
are in there with Fred Cana.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.600
Fred Cana?

08:24.600 --> 08:27.500
Yeah, he's the guy
who rented the safety...

08:30.800 --> 08:32.299
(CHUCKLES) Officer Esposito!

08:32.299 --> 08:34.400
Actually, it's Detective Esposito now,
Fred.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.200
Congratulations.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.299
Fred here is a bagman
for Victor Racine.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.500
Who's Victor Racine?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.700
He's a syndicate man.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.299
Made the leap from organized crime
to legitimate businessman

08:43.299 --> 08:44.500
while no one was looking.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.400
Racine is connected and untouchable.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.900
You ought to know.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.800
Esposito and his old partner
tried to touch him a few years back.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.900
How about I touch you instead?

08:51.900 --> 08:53.900
- Come on! Come on, tough guy!
- ESPOSITO: Let's go, man!

08:54.000 --> 08:57.500
RYAN: Come on. Take a walk, all right?
He's not worth it. Man.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.600
- What the hell was that all about?
- He works for Victor Racine.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.700
So?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.100
Victor Racine killed my partner.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.600
His name was Ike. Ike Thornton.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.600
We partnered up
back when I was at the 54th.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.100
We worked
the Organized Crime Task Force.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.200
Victor Racine was our target.

09:43.300 --> 09:46.500
Until, one day,
Ike didn't come into work.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
It's like he just disappeared.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.100
To make matters worse,
Internal Affairs came around here

09:51.100 --> 09:55.800
asking all these questions,
talking like Ike had gone over,

09:55.800 --> 09:57.400
that he was working for Racine.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.700
It was an absolute load of crap.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.600
Couple of days later, some kids
found Ike's car out by the docks.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.900
Shot to hell, blood all over the seats.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.900
All the hallmarks of a professional hit.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.100
Yeah, only we couldn't tie it back
to Racine.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.100
His guys had dumped Ike's body
so that we could never find him.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.500
The department shut down
the whole operation after that.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.100
I transferred here.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.600
But I know one thing,

10:22.700 --> 10:25.400
if Fred Cana has a safe deposit box,

10:25.400 --> 10:28.300
it's because he's holding something
for Racine.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.300
And it ain't no stamps.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.000
BECKETT: He wants blood.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.400
I don't blame him.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.500
From the look of it, I'm guessing

10:34.500 --> 10:36.700
Racine had Finch killed
for stealing from him.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.700
That explains why he was tortured.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.400
So he'd give up his partner.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.700
You know, whatever they stole
from that safe deposit box,

10:42.700 --> 10:44.300
Racine wants it back bad.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
Yeah, but how did he get onto Finch
in the first place?

10:46.400 --> 10:49.200
Maybe he recognized
the great smell of Brut.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.700
I'm sure that Racine is the kind of guy
who has his sources.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
So you like our stamp collector
for doing the deed on Racine's behalf?

10:54.700 --> 10:56.600
Sure, except we called.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.900
He has witnesses
willing to corroborate his whereabouts.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.100
- Of course he does.
- And we have no proof otherwise.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.200
Oh, speaking of which, they brought up
the CSU report on the crime scene.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.800
The car was wiped down.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.800
Other than Finch and his wife,
we got no usable prints.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.500
And we still don't have an ID
on that metal symbol we found.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.200
Meanwhile, our stamp collector
has an alibi,

11:15.200 --> 11:17.100
and we currently have no evidence.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.100
So what is our next step?

11:19.100 --> 11:21.700
We talk to the real victim
of our robbery.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.800
Mr. Victor Racine.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.200
Bold. I like your style.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.300
What, you think he's the kind of guy

11:27.400 --> 11:29.000
who's just gonna tell us
what's in that box

11:29.000 --> 11:31.600
or maybe admit to killing the thief?

11:31.700 --> 11:34.300
Watch and learn, Castle.
Watch and learn.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.300
To what do I owe this pleasure, huh?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.600
A safe deposit box at Manhattan Mutual

11:50.600 --> 11:53.100
was broken into the other night,
Mr. Racine.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.700
It was registered
to an associate of yours, Fred Cana.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.000
You don't say.
What's this world coming to, huh?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Mr. Cana claims that the box contained
his stamp collection?

12:03.200 --> 12:06.000
I've never known Mr. Cana to lie

12:07.900 --> 12:09.500
to me.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.900
We believe that it held something
a little bit more valuable.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.800
Maybe something of yours.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.300
Oh, really? And why is that?

12:15.300 --> 12:17.200
Because one of the guys
involved in the robbery

12:17.200 --> 12:19.800
was found murdered
in a parking garage last night.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.000
Actually, Mr. Finch was tortured
before he was killed.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.900
Now, why would someone do that
if all he stole were stamps?

12:25.900 --> 12:27.000
Hmm.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.300
Where were you last night?

12:30.600 --> 12:31.800
Home.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.800
And I have
around-the-clock bodyguards

12:36.800 --> 12:39.000
who can attest to my whereabouts,

12:39.100 --> 12:41.600
but you don't think I killed Finch.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.100
You assume
I had somebody do it for me,

12:44.100 --> 12:46.000
so you're here just to

12:47.200 --> 12:49.100
count coup, aren't you?

12:49.900 --> 12:51.400
Sorry. What was that?

12:51.400 --> 12:54.100
The Plains Indians
considered it an act of bravery

12:54.100 --> 12:55.500
to get close enough
to one of their enemies

12:55.500 --> 12:57.100
to touch him with a coup stick.
Is my hair...

12:57.100 --> 12:58.400
- Looks good.
- Thanks.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.200
This item or items
that were in the safety deposit box,

13:01.300 --> 13:05.700
if they're so valuable, why aren't you
out chasing down Mr. Finch's associate

13:05.700 --> 13:08.800
in this endeavor? After all,
you know what the old saying is,

13:08.800 --> 13:11.100
"no honor among thieves."

13:13.800 --> 13:17.200
See, what'd I say? Waste of time.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.400
Well played, Detective.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.000
Thank you, Detective.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.700
"Well played"? All he did was deny it.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.700
You can learn a lot from a denial.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.800
Like what?

13:26.800 --> 13:29.700
Like Racine hasn't found
Finch's partner yet.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.200
Because Racine would
never point us in that direction

13:32.200 --> 13:35.200
if he already knew
who or where the partner was.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.600
He must want this guy pretty bad

13:36.600 --> 13:38.600
if he's willing to have the cops
do his legwork for him.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.300
How does it help Racine
if we find Finch's partner first?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

13:41.500 --> 13:42.500
Racine's connected.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.100
He'd have no trouble
having Finch's partner killed in jail.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.400
Beckett.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.900
Hmm.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.200
Okay. We'll be right there.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.200
Lanie's ready to fume the body.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.400
All right,
you guys head back to the morgue.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.900
I'm gonna go see if Finch's financials
have come in yet.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.100
BECKETT: Okay.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.200
- What?
- Nothing.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.800
CASTLE: That is so cool.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.400
Do you mind if I take pictures?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.700
Knock yourself out.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.500
But if any of them
end up on the Internet,

14:18.500 --> 14:21.000
I will hunt you down and hurt you.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.000
So, what's with
the handsome robbery detective?

14:26.100 --> 14:27.200
Demming?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.400
Oh, we're just working
the case together. That's all.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.700
Mmm-hmm.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.900
But then again, you have been
working with Castle for a year

14:33.900 --> 14:36.400
and not a damn thing
has happened, so...

14:36.400 --> 14:38.000
We had a pool going.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.600
I lost a lot of money on you two.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.700
<i>You guys.</i>

14:44.200 --> 14:46.900
Yahtzee. The killer left a print
when he closed our victim's eye.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.400
Let's run it.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.300
Huh.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
What?

14:57.000 --> 15:02.100
We got a match on the print,
but the guy it belongs to is dead.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.400
But that's impossible.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.600
Unless he's a zombie.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.700
Not a zombie.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.000
A cop.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.500
Isaac "Ike" Thornton.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.100
- Esposito's old partner?
- He's alive.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.000
I went to his funeral,
held his wife's hand.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.600
And now you're telling me he's alive
and working for Racine?

15:30.700 --> 15:31.800
That he murdered Finch?

15:31.900 --> 15:33.500
It was the perfect disappearing act.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
He knew that everyone would think
that Racine had killed him

15:35.600 --> 15:37.100
and dumped his body somewhere.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.400
No, I don't see how he could do it.
To the badge, to me?

15:41.400 --> 15:42.600
I would've taken a bullet for him.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.200
Esposito.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.900
This is Lieutenant Holliwell
from Internal Affairs.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.300
We've met.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.500
- You called IA?
- No.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.300
I called them for your protection.

15:50.300 --> 15:53.900
I'm sorry, Detective.
I don't really enjoy being proved right.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
No, of course not.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.700
I take it
you were the investigating officer

15:57.800 --> 15:59.500
- when Ike Thornton disappeared?
- I was.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.700
And what put you onto him
in the first place?

16:01.800 --> 16:04.200
Racine was always
one step ahead of us,

16:04.300 --> 16:06.500
like he always knew
what we were thinking.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.600
It didn't take too much to figure out
that he was being tipped off by a cop.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.200
Luckily, we had an informant
at the time that confirmed it,

16:15.200 --> 16:19.200
but before we were able
to arrest Thornton, he disappeared.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.500
Most likely found out
that we were coming for him.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.600
When we found his car,
we just assumed Racine killed him.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.000
Looks like he brought him
into the family instead.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.200
Has Thornton contacted you?

16:28.300 --> 16:29.700
What do you mean, contacted me?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.100
Whoa. What exactly
are you accusing my partner of?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.800
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.300
Asking what?

16:36.200 --> 16:39.000
If I knew all along? If I was part of it?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.300
The answer's no.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.600
Well, such an elaborate hoax,

16:42.600 --> 16:44.900
it seems like it would take
a little bit of planning, a little help.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.400
I just told you, I didn't know.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.100
What do you want me to do,
take a poly?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.400
Would you? Take a polygraph test?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.800
- Wait a minute...
- lf it'll get you off my back.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.000
Esposito, you don't have to do this.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.700
- I want to.
- Good.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.700
My office. One hour.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.599
Guy was out of line back there.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.500
I'd be asking the same questions
if I was in his shoes.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.200
You know you can talk to me, right?

17:23.300 --> 17:25.300
I put all that stuff behind me, bro.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.700
The only thing
I have left from back then...

17:29.700 --> 17:31.100
This, right here.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.600
Back in the day, when I was in the 54th,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.800
everybody used to carry
one of these with them.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.400
It was like a sense of pride, you know?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.200
Ike have one of those?

17:38.300 --> 17:40.300
- Yeah. Why?
- Let me see it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.100
The 54th.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.300
It must have broken off
when he was struggling with Finch.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.800
It was him.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.600
You know, no one would blame you
if you stepped off this case.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.900
No.

18:04.700 --> 18:08.300
Partner or not, he killed a man.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.500
CASTLE: This guy's pulled
a ghost routine for years.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.200
Gave up his old life, his friends.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.900
A guy can't pull a disappearing act
like that without help from somebody.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.200
He had Racine's help.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.300
Well, Racine or no Racine,
he was married, right? Has a kid.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.300
They must have known.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.700
I saw Carol last month.
She doesn't know anything.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.800
You sure about that?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.400
Hell, I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.700
Where you going?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.800
Take a poly, clear my name.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.000
Go pick up the wife.
Let's see what she knows.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.000
I'm sorry. I don't believe you.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.000
His thumbprint's
on our victim's body, Carol.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.800
He's alive.
There's no other explanation.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.400
They never recovered Ike's body,
so I don't know.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.800
Someone could've
cut off his thumb and...

18:52.800 --> 18:56.300
Yes, they could've done that,
but you know they didn't.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.100
Come on, Carol. It's been years.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.400
An attractive woman like you
hasn't found someone new?

19:03.500 --> 19:05.900
It's not easy when you're a single mom.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.500
Not that that's any of your business.

19:09.100 --> 19:13.100
You know what you get when a cop
dies with a warrant out on him?

19:13.300 --> 19:14.900
I'll tell you what you don't get.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
You don't get a folded flag

19:16.100 --> 19:18.500
and you sure as hell don't get
a penny of his pension.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.000
And yet, you somehow managed
to make mortgage payments...

19:21.000 --> 19:24.100
If Ike is alive,
that means we're still married.

19:24.700 --> 19:28.100
And you can't compel me
to testify against my spouse.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.300
She knew he was alive, but did she
know he was working for Racine?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.300
She's a cop wife
and she knows her rights.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.300
Good luck getting anything out of her.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.600
She might talk to me.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.000
Oh! Look who passed his poly.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.800
Yeah. Had the feeling that Holliwell
was kind of disappointed.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.400
(CHUCKLES)

19:44.700 --> 19:47.300
She knows me.
I might be able to get her to open up.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.600
All right, take a run at her
in the morning.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.600
And I'll get a unit down to the house
in case Ike decides to show up.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.800
Right.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.300
CASTLE: Betrayal, lies, deceit.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.800
Sounds like my first marriage.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.500
- What?
- I'm trying to figure out

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
what was so damn important
in that safe deposit box

20:08.600 --> 20:12.200
that Finch and his partner
would risk their lives that way.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.300
Who are you calling?

20:13.600 --> 20:14.900
Demming.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.600
I was just calling you.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.900
What a coincidence.
I was just coming to see you.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.400
Wow. It's like
we're all on the same case.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.600
Esposito told me about Ike.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.200
- You have a lead on him yet?
- BECKETT: No.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.500
We're working on it.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.800
What about Finch's partner?

20:27.800 --> 20:31.600
Ah, there's nothing in his phone
or his financials that points to one.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.800
But the bank surveillance tapes
finally came in.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.700
I was gonna scrub them in the morning.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.800
If Finch cased the joint
in the last couple weeks...

20:37.800 --> 20:40.400
Then maybe the mystery partner
went with him.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.600
Exactly. You want to join me?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.700
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.900
Great. I'll see you in the morning.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.700
Okay, great. I'll see you. Good night.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.100
Good night.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.500
Castle, can I ask you something?

20:53.600 --> 20:54.800
You and Beckett,

20:54.900 --> 20:57.200
is there something going on?

20:57.300 --> 20:58.300
- Me and Beckett?
- Yeah.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
- No.
- Look, man, if I'm offside...

21:00.500 --> 21:02.300
No flag on the play.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.700
Great.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.200
Okay. Great.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.500
Don't smile
when you have a good card.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.200
You need to develop a poker face.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.300
Trust me. It comes in handy.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.200
Except when it doesn't.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.700
(STAMMERING) What do you mean?

21:34.300 --> 21:35.700
Never mind.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.500
Pair of ladies. What have you got?

21:40.100 --> 21:41.200
(SIGHING)

21:41.200 --> 21:42.500
Boom!

21:42.500 --> 21:45.200
Two cowboys! I win.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.700
Who's the daddy now?

21:47.700 --> 21:49.400
You win like your grandmother.

21:49.500 --> 21:54.500
(LAUGHS) So it looks like I owe you
one night of solo dish duty.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.600
And you owe me
four days of bed-making duty,

21:57.700 --> 21:59.800
three spa treatments,
two pairs of sunglasses,

21:59.900 --> 22:02.000
and a Bulgari purse for Gram.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.100
What's wrong?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.600
I'm not used to losing.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.400
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

22:16.700 --> 22:19.000
Hey, Carol. Got a few minutes?

22:20.300 --> 22:21.900
Uncle Javi!

22:21.900 --> 22:24.000
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
- What's up?

22:24.100 --> 22:25.300
- How you doing?
- Good.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.700
Good. Oh, man, you looking tall.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.600
Hey, this is my boy, Kevin.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.900
Hi. I'm Tim.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.000
Nice to meet you, Tim.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.300
Hey, he loves baseball cards.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.200
Why don't you take him upstairs
and show him yours?

22:37.300 --> 22:39.400
- Come on.
- RYAN: Yeah, let's go.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.900
How long have you known?

22:51.000 --> 22:54.700
Carol, it'll be a lot easier for him
if you just tell me where he is.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.500
(SIGHS)

22:57.300 --> 22:59.000
So you can arrest him?

22:59.100 --> 23:01.000
Carol, he killed a man.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.400
No.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.000
His prints were on the body.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.400
Please.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.300
Please.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.400
Do not try to find him.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.500
Not now, not when we are so close.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.200
So close to what?

23:17.200 --> 23:18.500
(SIGHS)

23:18.800 --> 23:20.200
I'm sorry.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.800
I can't.

23:35.100 --> 23:38.000
You know, if your mouse finger
gets tired, we can switch.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.600
That's okay. I think I can handle it.

23:39.700 --> 23:42.500
Oh, I get it. You don't want to give up
the driver's seat.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.000
Hey, I brought coffee.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.300
Ah, you know what? It's okay.
Demming already brought some.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.700
Did he now?

23:50.700 --> 23:52.400
Hey, Paul Finch.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.000
Oh, yeah. He's casing the place.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.500
BECKETT: And look who his partner is.

23:58.500 --> 24:02.400
That's his wife Monica. She said
she had no idea what he was doing.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.900
There's someone else with them.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.200
That's...

24:06.900 --> 24:08.100
BECKETT: Ike Thornton.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.700
If he's working for Racine,
what's he doing with Finch?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.900
So Ike was working with Finch?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.500
Yeah, it looks that way.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.700
I'm guessing he discovered Racine was
keeping something valuable in the box.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.700
He needed Finch's skills
to help him get it.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.600
But if they were working together,
why would he kill him?

24:29.700 --> 24:30.900
CASTLE: Maybe Racine was right.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.700
Maybe there is no honor
amongst thieves.

24:32.700 --> 24:33.800
And maybe he didn't do it.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.900
We have him at the scene.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.800
Him working with Finch,
what his wife said, it doesn't add.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.000
Something else is going on.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.200
Looks like we're about to find out what.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.200
BECKETT: Here's the thing, Monica,
we're not interested

24:45.300 --> 24:47.700
in whether you helped
your husband case the bank.

24:47.800 --> 24:51.600
All we care about is finding the guy
who killed him. Ike Thornton.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.400
You think Ike Thornton killed Paul?

24:54.500 --> 24:57.000
Let me tell you the kind of man Ike is.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.700
About 12 years back, he collared Paul
and his kid brother Barry on a heist.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.500
Ike saw that Barry was a first-timer,
so he cut him a break.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.200
Paul went to jail for five years,

25:05.200 --> 25:08.300
but he never forgot
what Ike did for his brother.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.900
That's why he did this last job with him,
as payback.

25:10.900 --> 25:11.900
Payback's a bitch,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.900
because we found Ike's fingerprints
on your husband's body.

25:14.900 --> 25:15.900
I don't believe it.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.900
It doesn't matter if you don't believe it.
The fact is, Ike was there.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
He tortured and killed your husband.

25:21.100 --> 25:25.000
What was in the box, Monica?
What did they steal from Racine?

25:25.700 --> 25:26.800
It must have been pretty valuable

25:26.800 --> 25:29.500
if Ike decided to kill your husband
so he wouldn't have to split it.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.000
(LAUGHS) Split it?
There was nothing to split.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.500
What was in the box?

25:35.100 --> 25:36.400
(SIGHS)

25:37.200 --> 25:39.300
A book. A ledger.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.700
A ledger?

25:41.300 --> 25:43.800
Something that showed
all of Racine's pays and owes

25:43.900 --> 25:47.400
on all of his businesses,
not just his legitimate ones.

25:48.100 --> 25:51.100
An accounting
of all of Racine's illegal operations

25:51.100 --> 25:52.800
could be worth a bundle in blackmail.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.400
It could if they'd gotten it,

25:54.500 --> 25:56.800
but when they hit the bank,
the box was empty.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.000
Empty?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.900
The ledger wasn't there.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.700
So a guy tortures and kills his partner

26:02.700 --> 26:06.600
after breaking into a bank
to steal something from his boss

26:06.700 --> 26:08.500
that wasn't actually there.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.700
It sounds crazy
when you say it like that.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.500
Look, I know he was my partner,
but no matter how I slice it,

26:13.500 --> 26:16.100
it makes no sense
that Ike would kill Finch.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.600
- Detective Beckett.
- Lieutenant Holliwell.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.800
Sorry to interrupt,
but my team's been up on a wire

26:20.900 --> 26:24.100
monitoring the cell phones of several
key members of Racine's organization.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.800
We've been listening
for any mention of Ike Thornton.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.700
- And?
- And it turns out,

26:28.800 --> 26:30.400
we're not the only ones looking for him.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.900
Racine just put a price
on Thornton's head.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.800
BECKETT: Racine must have found out
he was going after the ledger.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.800
I guess you're not the only one
your old partner betrayed.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Carol.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.400
Where you going?

26:42.400 --> 26:43.500
If Racine's going after Ike,

26:43.500 --> 26:45.300
the first place he's gonna go
is the same place we went,

26:45.300 --> 26:46.400
his wife and kid.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.100
- Ryan.
- Yeah.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.300
I'm gonna call the surveillance team.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.600
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

26:53.700 --> 26:54.900
ESPOSITO: Carol!

26:56.700 --> 26:58.200
Carol, it's Javi!

26:59.700 --> 27:00.800
Carol!

27:03.700 --> 27:04.900
Timmy!

27:10.800 --> 27:12.400
Upstairs. Go.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.500
Carol!

27:17.800 --> 27:19.000
Timmy!

27:22.900 --> 27:24.000
(SIGHS)

27:24.100 --> 27:25.300
Nothing.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.900
They're gone.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.000
Surveillance team said they never left.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.100
- How the hell did they...
- Racine.

27:33.900 --> 27:35.100
Have the uniforms
canvass the neighbors.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.200
Maybe somebody saw something.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.700
Yeah, on it.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.600
I appreciate
what you done for my boy, Javi.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.300
Carol and Tim. Where are they?

28:16.300 --> 28:18.600
Somewhere
where Racine can't find them.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.500
We've had guys on this place 24l7.
How the hell did you get in here?

28:21.500 --> 28:24.400
Three years as a ghost,
you learn a few things.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.800
So IA was right.

28:30.900 --> 28:32.600
Three years ago.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.200
Now.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.000
- You were working for Racine.
- Is that what you believe?

28:38.100 --> 28:40.400
You let me think you were dead.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.500
And now you're holding a burner
on me.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.500
(SIGHS)

28:47.200 --> 28:49.400
You're a good cop, Javi.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.600
But I put this down,
you're gonna take me in.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
And I can't let you do that, not yet.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.300
- Not when I'm so close.
- So close to what?

28:57.400 --> 29:00.000
There is a dirty cop on Racine's payroll.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.100
So in order to throw them off of his guy,
Racine dirtied me up.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.700
And IA bought it hook, line and sinker.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
Why didn't you just come to me?

29:06.900 --> 29:09.600
Look, cases like mine
are contagious, brother.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.400
I couldn't let you catch what I had.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.600
Racine's guy fed them
so much garbage,

29:14.600 --> 29:16.200
they could lock me up.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.800
And if I had let them,

29:17.800 --> 29:19.700
Racine would have had me
shanked at Rikers

29:19.700 --> 29:21.200
before I could clear my name.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.200
- Where you been?
- Watching, learning.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.300
That's how I found out about the ledger.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.400
Racine's pays and owes.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.300
Everyone on his payroll,
including the dirty cop that set me up.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.400
But the ledger wasn't in the bank
like you thought.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.000
Somehow, Racine found Finch.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.200
You were there, man.
We found your prints.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.800
He was dead when I found him, Jav.

29:38.900 --> 29:41.500
I just closed his eyes. Come on, man.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
And the ledger?

29:43.100 --> 29:45.400
I know where the ledger is.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.700
But I need a little more time, Javi.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.800
Just until tomorrow night.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.000
You used to carry yours
with you all the time.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.100
(SIGHS)

30:10.300 --> 30:11.800
I still do, man.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.400
Then that means there's
somebody else mixed up in this,

30:14.500 --> 30:15.800
somebody from the 54th.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
Whoever it is,
they tipped Racine that I'm still alive,

30:17.800 --> 30:19.900
which means they're close.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.200
Maybe a part of your investigation.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.400
54th.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.300
Demming.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.600
It's him.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.900
Got to be.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.100
Remember how he said
he requested this case?

30:41.200 --> 30:42.200
ESPOSITO: Said he liked
the weird ones,

30:42.300 --> 30:45.200
but it was just so he could hunt down
the thieves for Racine.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.300
I knew there was something
I didn't like about him.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.100
Too pretty.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.800
Bet he takes yoga classes
just so he can pick up girls.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.800
All these years, he's been
lining his pockets with Racine's cash,

30:55.900 --> 30:57.200
leaving Thornton holding the bag.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.600
<i>Probably subscribes
to The New Yorker,</i>

30:58.600 --> 30:59.700
but doesn't even read it.

30:59.700 --> 31:02.800
The guy's been playing us all along,
using us to find Finch's accomplice.

31:02.900 --> 31:06.000
Just leaves copies laying out
where people can see them.

31:06.100 --> 31:08.100
Let's nail the bastard.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.200
How?

31:09.200 --> 31:12.000
If he was tipping off Racine,
he wouldn't use the precinct phone.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.200
He'd use his cell.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.900
We could pull his SIM card.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.500
If there are any calls to Racine,
we have all the proof we need.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.600
How are we gonna get
his phone away from him?

31:21.200 --> 31:22.700
What's up, man?

31:24.300 --> 31:25.800
I have an idea.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.600
(BOTH GRUNTING)

31:35.700 --> 31:37.000
- (LAUGHS)
- Wow.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.700
It's been a while for me.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.200
You know, I'll try to be gentle.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.300
You do that.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.100
(BOTH GRUNTING)

31:46.900 --> 31:48.300
Too much for you?

31:48.300 --> 31:51.300
No, no.
I'm just a little slow to get started.

31:51.700 --> 31:53.100
(GRUNTING)

31:55.100 --> 31:57.100
But I think I'm starting
to find my rhythm now.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.700
(ALL COUGHING)

32:08.100 --> 32:09.400
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:11.300 --> 32:12.600
ESPOSITO: Let's go. Hurry up.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.900
(HISSING)

32:14.700 --> 32:16.600
Ow! What?

32:16.800 --> 32:19.000
Hey, man. What's up? Showering?

32:22.600 --> 32:23.900
- Got it.
- Let's go.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.400
(GRUNTING)

32:27.500 --> 32:29.900
- Any leads on Thornton?
- None.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.300
How's Esposito taking all this?

32:31.300 --> 32:32.800
How do you think?

32:32.800 --> 32:34.900
I mean, here's a guy who's been
carrying his 54th key fob

32:35.000 --> 32:36.900
in honor of his partner's sacrifice.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.200
- I had one of those.
- Oh, yeah?

32:38.200 --> 32:39.300
Yeah.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.100
(GRUNTING)

32:41.900 --> 32:43.300
(EX CLAIMS)

32:44.300 --> 32:46.700
But I lost mine years ago.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.400
Come on.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.400
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

32:51.900 --> 32:53.000
All right.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.800
Bet this guy does a lot of sexting, too.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.400
It's uploading now.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.200
(GASPING)

33:18.300 --> 33:21.500
I gotta tell you, I don't know
how much longer I can keep this up.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.500
You know, I hear it helps
if you think about baseball.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.000
(GRUNTING)

33:28.300 --> 33:30.500
So what do you do for fun, Kate, huh?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.400
When you're not trying
to take someone's head off?

33:32.400 --> 33:33.600
I'm actually kind of a homebody.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.000
(GRUNTING)

33:36.600 --> 33:38.400
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

33:39.300 --> 33:43.300
You know, the night before I met you,
I went home to read a book.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.500
No kidding?

33:46.300 --> 33:48.000
- (GRUNTS)
- Whoa!

33:48.700 --> 33:50.100
(EX CLAIMS)

33:50.500 --> 33:51.800
What about you?

33:52.400 --> 33:56.000
What about me what?
What do I do for fun?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.400
Or what was I doing
the night before we met?

34:01.100 --> 34:03.000
Seriously. (PANTING)

34:03.000 --> 34:05.800
Why don't you just ask me
if I have an alibi for Finch's murder?

34:05.900 --> 34:07.300
(CHUCKLING)

34:09.500 --> 34:11.000
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:14.300 --> 34:16.800
Okay. So where were you?

34:16.800 --> 34:18.100
(GRUNTS)

34:20.199 --> 34:22.000
RYAN: I ran all his numbers
through the reverse directory.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.800
They're all coming clean.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.300
That's because it wasn't Demming.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.199
- Your alibi checked out.
- Thank you.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.400
He really was coaching

34:35.500 --> 34:38.300
an underprivileged
youth basketball league.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.300
For what it's worth,
my kids won that night.

34:41.699 --> 34:42.900
Oh, geez.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.900
RYAN: Sorry, man. Had to rule you out.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.600
Let's just move on.

34:46.699 --> 34:49.300
Look, there's a wrong cop out there.
We need to figure out who it is.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.900
You know how many cops
have gone through the 54th

34:51.000 --> 34:52.300
in the last 10 years?

34:52.300 --> 34:53.900
Hundreds, maybe thousands.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.500
BECKETT: Whoever it was,
was very good.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.300
You don't work the other side
without arousing IA suspicion

34:58.300 --> 34:59.600
unless you know what you're doing.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.200
Yeah, we're never gonna find him,
not in time anyway.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.700
In time for what?

35:03.800 --> 35:05.600
I gotta take a walk.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.700
Hey, I thought
you were going for a walk.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.400
What do you want?

35:17.100 --> 35:19.600
Thornton's going after
the ledger tonight, isn't he?

35:19.700 --> 35:22.100
The man's been on the run for
three years, separated from his family.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.200
I gotta help the guy,
so don't try to stop me.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.700
I'm not.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.300
- I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

35:27.300 --> 35:28.800
I'm your partner.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.800
That means I'm with you
till the wheels fall off.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.300
I know, bro.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.400
But I'm gonna need you to get my back
if things go wrong, all right?

35:38.500 --> 35:39.500
Okay.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.100
Thanks.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.000
Tell me you got something, people.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.100
Unfortunately, sir,
we are dead in the water.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.300
No, we're not.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.200
If Thornton never worked for Racine,

36:03.200 --> 36:05.200
then someone lied to IA
three years ago.

36:05.300 --> 36:07.200
To throw suspicion
from the real dirty cop.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.000
So whoever IA was talking to,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
they must know
who the real dirty cop is.

36:11.100 --> 36:13.300
All we need to do
is get the name of the informant

36:13.300 --> 36:14.600
from Holliwell and run him down.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.600
(SCOFFING) Easier said than done.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
There's no way an IA officer
is gonna give up the name

36:18.600 --> 36:20.000
of a confidential informant.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.900
We'll see about that.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.000
You sure you're ready
to bet your badge on this?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.400
Pretty long odds.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.600
You're my partner.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.200
You sure you can get us
in Racine's office?

36:36.300 --> 36:39.400
Trust me. I've been casing the joint
for three years.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.500
Let's roll.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.200
BECKETT: Sir, how did you do it?

36:45.200 --> 36:47.800
Pulling strings and trading favors.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.800
This can't be right.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.200
The investigation against
Ike Thornton three years ago,

36:53.200 --> 36:55.600
Lieutenant Holliwell lists
his chief informant

36:55.600 --> 36:57.800
as Detective Javier Esposito.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.400
MONTGOMERY: Son of a bitch.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.600
- What does that mean?
- It means there was no informant.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.400
Sir, is there any way to find out
if Holliwell served at the 54th?

37:15.300 --> 37:16.700
Come on, bro.
What the hell's taking so long?

37:16.700 --> 37:18.100
I could have chewed
through that by now.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
Here.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.300
There we go.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.400
Nice thing about Internal Affairs,

37:42.400 --> 37:44.600
it's our job to monitor other cops.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.900
You should've turned your
cell phone off completely, Esposito.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.400
You know, with GPS and all.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.000
All this time, it was you.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.300
I figured you'd come for that
sooner or later.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.800
Big mistake.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.100
Toss the ledger over here.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.200
Throw it!

38:14.000 --> 38:15.600
See, if I were you, Thornton,

38:15.600 --> 38:17.200
(CHUCKLING)

38:17.200 --> 38:18.800
I would've just stayed dead.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.100
You're not me. I'm a cop.

38:21.100 --> 38:24.300
I beg to differ, buddy.
You're a wanted criminal.

38:24.900 --> 38:26.800
Just ask Esposito over here.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.800
He died trying to apprehend you.

38:28.900 --> 38:30.700
My only regret is that I...

38:30.700 --> 38:32.200
I showed up too late to save him.

38:32.300 --> 38:33.300
You son of a bitch.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.600
Look, there's something I want
to say before we're done here.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.600
Thanks for backing me up.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.300
Lot of good that did us.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.700
I am going to get the Medal of Valor
for killing you, Thornton.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.800
No, I'm serious, man.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.900
Thanks for having my back.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.200
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

39:04.800 --> 39:06.600
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

39:07.300 --> 39:08.700
Thank God you're here.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.000
They tried to kill me. Esposito
and Thornton, they're both in on it.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.600
Drop it or I will drop you.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.800
RYAN: You know the drill, Holliwell.
Keep them up.

39:33.400 --> 39:37.700
Lieutenant Holliwell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Paul Finch.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.400
Where's Esposito?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.700
Where's Esposito?

39:41.900 --> 39:43.200
Esposito?

39:43.300 --> 39:44.500
Yeah.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.400
We got an officer down.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.900
William 16, William 16,
need an ambulance at 3471 Houston.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.400
I'm cool. It was a clean exit.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.500
Holliwell?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.400
Yeah, we got him and the ledger.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.800
Good.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.200
- Ike.
- Yeah.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.500
- This is my partner, Ryan.
- Hey.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.700
And this is my other partner, Castle.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.900
Hey, man.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.300
And with Holliwell's testimony
and the ledger,

40:15.300 --> 40:18.300
we now have enough evidence
to arrest Racine.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.400
Okay, but what I don't understand
is how the hell you ended up

40:21.400 --> 40:23.100
in Racine's office with Thornton.

40:23.100 --> 40:25.500
- Sir, I...
- Oh, I... I'm sorry, sir.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.600
I thought we made that clear.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.400
Esposito was with us

40:29.400 --> 40:32.900
when we responded to a robbery
in progress call at Racine's office.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.200
Uh-huh. And who made the call?

40:35.500 --> 40:39.500
The call was made by a private citizen
who wishes to remain anonymous.

40:39.500 --> 40:43.100
I may need a private citizen
to help me write up this damn mess.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.600
I'd be happy to lend my expertise.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.700
So...

41:14.100 --> 41:16.000
I know you're not turning me loose.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.300
Just a furlough.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.700
We got something we want you to see.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.100
You did it, bro.

41:46.700 --> 41:49.000
And the best news is

41:49.000 --> 41:50.300
you're free to go.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.600
As far as I'm concerned,
Finch acted alone.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.500
It's my case. I'm closing it.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.600
CASTLE: And I don't see Racine
pressing charges anytime soon.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.100
Right now, he's trying to deny
that the ledger is his.

42:02.500 --> 42:05.000
It's time for you to go home, Ike.

42:20.500 --> 42:23.400
So is it always this much fun up here?

42:23.400 --> 42:25.200
We have our moments.

42:25.700 --> 42:28.800
So now that you know
I'm not a dirty cop,

42:28.900 --> 42:31.500
anytime you need a sparring partner...

42:31.500 --> 42:32.600
Thanks.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.000
(CHUCKLING)

42:34.900 --> 42:37.100
- BECKETT: I'm sorry. What?
- I find...

42:38.800 --> 42:40.000
BECKETT: What?
