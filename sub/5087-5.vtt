WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:10.833
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:10.933 --> 00:11.867
But is it any good?

00:11.967 --> 00:13.200
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.300 --> 00:14.233
but I don't review

00:14.333 --> 00:15.867
food, books, or movies.

00:15.967 --> 00:17.967
I review life itself.

00:18.067 --> 00:19.567
[screams]

00:19.667 --> 00:21.500
[triumphant music]

00:21.600 --> 00:22.400
[parrot squawks]

00:22.500 --> 00:26.767
*

00:26.867 --> 00:28.000
Over here.

00:28.100 --> 00:32.200
*

00:33.733 --> 00:35.367
Welcome to Review.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.400
The sailor standing before you
is named Forrest MacNeil,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.033
and I am he.

00:39.133 --> 00:41.967
Ahoy, there's a mermaid
to my left,

00:42.067 --> 00:43.933
and her name is A.J. Gibbs.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.667
What a weird intro.

00:45.767 --> 00:46.800
Let's see what
we've got, eh?

00:46.900 --> 00:48.000
Yes.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.133
This next review
comes from a man

00:49.233 --> 00:52.667
or woman named Merle
from Plano, Texas.

00:52.767 --> 00:53.900
Okay.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.933
Hi there, Forrest,

00:55.033 --> 00:56.500
I've got four months left

00:56.600 --> 00:58.200
on a subscription
to an Internet dating website

00:58.300 --> 01:01.867
that has yielded me
exactly zero dates.

01:01.967 --> 01:04.667
What's it like
to catfish someone?

01:04.767 --> 01:06.067
- To catfish?
- Hmm.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.933
Well, I don't know
what that is,

01:08.067 --> 01:09.333
but I'm going to go find out,

01:09.433 --> 01:11.400
and then I'll review it.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.800
I'm sorry, what kind of fish
was it again?

01:14.900 --> 01:16.100
From what I understand,

01:16.200 --> 01:19.300
catfishing is
some kind of a prank,

01:19.400 --> 01:21.800
wherein one party,
the fisherman,

01:21.900 --> 01:25.900
creates a fake identity in order
to lure an unsuspecting party,

01:26.067 --> 01:27.433
the fisherman's cat,

01:27.533 --> 01:30.767
into falling in love
with this made-up phantom.

01:30.867 --> 01:32.300
That's ridiculous.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.867
Why would anybody
want to do that?

01:33.967 --> 01:36.367
(Forrest)
This review was sure
to be complicated by the fact

01:36.467 --> 01:39.900
that my father and I
were now living in my office

01:40.067 --> 01:40.767
because his first
and second homes

01:40.867 --> 01:43.100
had been freakishly destroyed.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.067
Aah!
We've got to get out of here!

01:45.100 --> 01:46.467
[explosion, screams]

01:46.567 --> 01:47.667
(Forrest)
And we were sharing the space

01:47.767 --> 01:50.167
with my intern, Josh,
and his girlfriend, Tina,

01:50.267 --> 01:51.933
who had been
squatting on my couch

01:52.067 --> 01:53.633
without permission for months.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.367
Seems like a crazy waste
of time for the catfisher.

01:55.467 --> 01:58.300
Well, when I've done it,
I've done it for power,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.400
for boredom, or, like,
when you just have 30 minutes

02:01.500 --> 02:03.967
before a thing
you have to be at.

02:04.067 --> 02:05.633
I just do it
'cause Tina does it.

02:05.733 --> 02:06.667
Is everybody done?

02:06.767 --> 02:08.333
Because one of us is
a life reviewer

02:08.433 --> 02:09.600
who has to go out
and have this experience

02:09.700 --> 02:13.100
and share special, universal
insights about it, okay?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.400
- [groans]
- That one is me.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.667
I'm the life reviewer.

02:15.767 --> 02:17.200
So, Lucille,
will you please give me

02:17.300 --> 02:18.933
the HTML website address

02:19.067 --> 02:20.800
for Googling things?

02:20.900 --> 02:22.200
We've been through this.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.067
Yes, I know.
You know what?

02:24.100 --> 02:24.933
I'll write it
on a Post-it this time

02:25.067 --> 02:27.500
and just keep it on my desk.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.133
W...

02:28.233 --> 02:29.467
- Yep.
- W...

02:29.567 --> 02:30.467
Uh-huh.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.067
W...

02:33.133 --> 02:34.800
- Okay.
- Dot...

02:34.900 --> 02:35.900
Yep.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.767
- G...
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.933
- O...
- Okay.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.233
- O...
- Yes.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.200
- G...
- Yep.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.667
- L...
- Mm-hmm.

02:44.767 --> 02:47.467
E...

02:47.567 --> 02:48.700
Dot...

02:48.800 --> 02:50.467
Another dot?

02:50.567 --> 02:51.133
Yeah.

02:51.233 --> 02:53.233
- Okay.
- C...

02:53.333 --> 02:54.633
- Mm-hmm.
- O...

02:54.733 --> 02:55.633
Okay.

02:55.733 --> 02:57.300
M.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.800
And what do I do?
I just type that into Google?

03:00.900 --> 03:02.200
Yep.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.600
Boy, she really
knows this stuff, huh?

03:03.700 --> 03:04.867
- She does, actually.
- Wow.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.333
- She's great.
- Wow.

03:06.433 --> 03:07.167
(Forrest)
To begin
my catfishing experience,

03:07.267 --> 03:09.067
I would first need my bait:

03:09.100 --> 03:10.933
a fraudulent profile.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.567
- How tall?
- Tall.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.567
(Forrest)
My roommates
insisted on helping,

03:14.667 --> 03:15.967
and they decided this fake man
should love children...

03:16.067 --> 03:18.400
- Kids and dogs.
- Like dogs...

03:18.500 --> 03:19.933
- Tolerate your cats.
- And tolerate your cats.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.267
- Be smart but not neurotic...
- Smart but not neurotic.

03:22.367 --> 03:23.700
- Outstanding in bed.
- Outstanding in the bedroom

03:23.800 --> 03:24.900
- but free of STDs.
- No STDs.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.667
- He's known heartbreak...
- Heartbreak...

03:26.767 --> 03:28.233
- But has no baggage.
- But he has no baggage.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.700
- Wow.
- God, beautiful.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.633
(Forrest)
In short,
this online Frankenstein monster

03:32.733 --> 03:34.900
was almost entirely the opposite
of Forrest MacNeil.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.333
No baggage.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.600
(Forrest)
But there was one other thing

03:37.700 --> 03:39.433
that I alone
would bestow upon him.

03:39.533 --> 03:43.267
May I please be the one
to say what his name is?

03:43.367 --> 03:46.267
And I knew
exactly what that name would be.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.933
The most popular classmate
in my fourth grade class

03:49.067 --> 03:52.633
was a boy impressively
named Charles Sweddington.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.067
Now, one day
Charles wore his father's

03:55.133 --> 03:56.567
Oscar de la Renta cologne
to school,

03:56.667 --> 04:00.533
and from that point forward,
he became known as Oscar.

04:00.633 --> 04:04.333
Oscar enjoyed his status
in our hierarchy

04:04.433 --> 04:06.433
for quite a while until
a Swedish exchange student

04:06.533 --> 04:09.700
with the delicious name
of Alvin Klassen arrived

04:09.800 --> 04:11.500
to make a play
for the throne.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.300
Now, by Christmas, Alvin
revealed himself to be deficient

04:14.400 --> 04:15.867
in several key regions
of the brain,

04:15.967 --> 04:18.467
including those responsible
for impulse control

04:18.567 --> 04:20.067
and where to put your hands,

04:20.133 --> 04:23.233
and the name Alvin
became synonymous with "weirdo."

04:23.333 --> 04:24.533
So Charles Sweddington,

04:24.633 --> 04:26.467
aka Oscar,
reclaimed his designation

04:26.567 --> 04:27.867
as our most popular student,

04:27.967 --> 04:29.967
and I, for one,
have never forgotten him.

04:30.067 --> 04:33.067
Now that it's time
to choose my nom de catfish,

04:33.167 --> 04:34.200
I know just what to do.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.233
- His name is Ace Shrift.
- [groans]

04:38.333 --> 04:40.967
It is an anagram
for "catfisher."

04:41.067 --> 04:43.600
You see, Charles Sweddington
appreciated an anagram

04:43.700 --> 04:46.067
more than anyone
I have ever known.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.500
He would love "Ace Shrift."

04:47.600 --> 04:51.367
There is one final capstone
to place on this monument

04:51.467 --> 04:52.567
to dishonesty.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.833
Ace Shrift is going
to need a face.

04:54.933 --> 04:58.933
(Forrest)
I did an image search
on www.google.com.

04:59.067 --> 05:02.067
"Very handsome man."

05:02.133 --> 05:05.133
Oh, plenty of
uncomplicated-looking dullards

05:05.233 --> 05:06.633
to choose from on here.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.100
Please allow me to borrow
your very handsome head.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.500
[chuckles]

05:10.600 --> 05:12.200
(Forrest)
45 minutes later,

05:12.300 --> 05:13.067
I had pasted
a handsome stranger's face

05:13.167 --> 05:15.500
to my dating profile,

05:15.600 --> 05:18.567
and I set my geographical
settings to "anywhere."

05:18.667 --> 05:22.600
So let's just go ahead
and go live, as they say.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.433
[chuckles]
Wow, look at that.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.700
(Forrest)
I was instantly matched

05:25.800 --> 05:27.333
with a number
of enticing ladies

05:27.433 --> 05:30.067
and several nut jobs
from all over the world.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.333
And then...

05:32.433 --> 05:33.600
Oh.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.700
[bleep].

05:35.800 --> 05:38.067
(Forrest)
To my utter astonishment,

05:38.133 --> 05:39.467
one of the sad sack ladies

05:39.567 --> 05:42.400
who matched with
the devilish cad, Ace Shrift,

05:42.500 --> 05:44.800
was my ex-wife, Suzanne.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.400
This was a stunning turn
of events,

05:46.500 --> 05:49.433
and I did not know
how Ace would handle it.

05:55.100 --> 05:55.967
(Forrest)
While searching for victims
for my catfish scheme,

05:56.067 --> 05:58.267
I somehow came across a woman

05:58.367 --> 06:01.067
whose user name
is NoJerksPlease

06:01.100 --> 06:03.267
but whose real name
is my ex-wife Suzanne,

06:03.367 --> 06:06.767
a woman I had loved dearly
but had to divorce

06:06.867 --> 06:09.300
so that others
might learn from my experience.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.633
You are gonna die alone!

06:10.733 --> 06:13.067
Let's not do this.
I don't want to be divorced.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.067
But even when I begged her
to take me back four times...

06:15.100 --> 06:16.167
Stop it.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.267
(Forrest)
She said no, no...

06:18.367 --> 06:19.400
- [bleep]!
- No and no.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.067
Sweetheart, don't--
Aah.

06:21.133 --> 06:23.467
(Forrest)
Although I have since
gotten over her completely,

06:23.567 --> 06:26.333
there was something delicious
about a little harmless payback.

06:26.433 --> 06:30.833
So here we go.
It's time to set the bait.

07:04.533 --> 07:07.233
Many times in my life
I have approached a woman

07:07.333 --> 07:10.733
and broken the ice
and been told to go away,

07:10.833 --> 07:12.767
but this, waiting with
the chance of no reply at all,

07:12.867 --> 07:15.400
is maddening.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.400
Has she received the message?

07:16.500 --> 07:17.667
'Cause her profile says

07:17.767 --> 07:19.667
that she has been online
since I sent it,

07:19.767 --> 07:21.067
but has she read it?

07:21.100 --> 07:23.400
And if she has,

07:23.500 --> 07:26.600
why is she rejecting Ace?

07:26.700 --> 07:29.333
Maybe she's not interested
in the opposite of me at all.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.800
I mean, maybe she--

07:31.900 --> 07:34.100
Oh.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.667
That's her.

07:35.767 --> 07:36.533
Oh, that's Suzanne.

07:36.633 --> 07:38.500
(Forrest)
I have to confess,

07:38.600 --> 07:41.333
I did feel a tinge of excitement
that she was interested in me--

07:41.433 --> 07:43.467
by which I mean Ace,
who does not exist.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.733
[laughs]

07:59.900 --> 08:03.267
(Forrest)
Deceiving Suzanne
in this way was exhilarating.

08:03.367 --> 08:05.300
She had broken my heart.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.933
She had refused to take me back,

08:08.067 --> 08:11.567
but now, Ace Shrift
had given me the upper hand.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.967
Ace was a cold-blooded fisherman

08:14.067 --> 08:15.967
out to catch
a warm-blooded fish,

08:16.067 --> 08:18.667
and I, Forrest, through Ace,

08:18.767 --> 08:21.467
saw an opportunity
to toy with her heart

08:21.567 --> 08:23.267
as she had toyed with mine.

08:23.367 --> 08:24.833
(Josh)
Mr. MacNeil!

08:24.933 --> 08:26.467
Close your stupid computer.

08:26.567 --> 08:28.200
Your face looks
like a scary nightlight.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.800
You're overplaying your hand.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.267
She's gonna think
you're desperate, okay?

08:31.367 --> 08:33.433
Shut your computer,
and go to sleep.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.767
(Forrest)
Catfishing was proving
to be a very satisfying pastime.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.500
(Tina)
Oh, God.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.467
(Forrest)
Over the next few days,

08:56.567 --> 08:59.167
Ace and Suzanne
became an online item.

08:59.267 --> 09:02.700
They chatted each and every day
and often deep into the night.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.467
Suzanne was falling for Ace,
and, truth be told,

09:06.567 --> 09:08.567
Ace was not unmoved.

09:08.667 --> 09:12.367
Then, a bombshell
dropped from the Internet.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.900
My catfish wants to Skype.
What is Skype?

09:18.067 --> 09:22.067
Oh, you're [bleep].

09:22.133 --> 09:24.067
What am I supposed to do?
I wouldn't be catfishing her

09:24.100 --> 09:26.800
if I'm sitting in front of my
computer looking at her, right?

09:26.900 --> 09:30.767
You've done
a reverse image search?

09:30.867 --> 09:31.867
What is that?

09:31.967 --> 09:32.600
Put the image in,
find out who that is?

09:32.700 --> 09:35.167
No!

09:35.267 --> 09:37.667
(Forrest)
I was now in the trickiest part
of catfishing,

09:37.767 --> 09:39.467
where you have to find
the handsome man

09:39.567 --> 09:41.933
whose picture you used
in your fake profile

09:42.067 --> 09:44.633
and persuade him
to Skype with your ex-wife.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.067
There he is.

09:46.167 --> 09:47.167
Oh.

09:47.267 --> 09:48.533
What?

09:48.633 --> 09:52.233
That's Joe Dale Jr.,
the baseball player.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.733
Thanks to
my complete ignorance

09:54.833 --> 09:56.367
of professional sports,
I had chosen the face

09:56.467 --> 10:00.033
of a shortstopman
for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.133
[sighs]

10:01.233 --> 10:02.967
How about this place, huh?

10:03.067 --> 10:04.933
(Forrest)
On the bright side,
he was easy to locate

10:05.033 --> 10:06.900
and can be hired
to make personal appearances

10:07.000 --> 10:07.900
of any nature.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.200
- Yo.
- Hello!

10:09.300 --> 10:10.200
(Forrest)
On the dark side,

10:10.300 --> 10:11.667
his appearance fee

10:11.767 --> 10:12.733
completely wiped out
my retirement account.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.267
Did you bring
the cashier's check?

10:14.367 --> 10:16.367
- Right here.
- Cool.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.700
Beautiful, beautiful home.
Wow.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.533
Hello, I'm Forrest.
This is my producer, Grant.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.133
Hey, Joe,
if that's your wife,

10:23.233 --> 10:24.333
we should just
make sure she's not--

10:24.433 --> 10:25.867
- That's not my wife.
- Oh, okay.

10:25.967 --> 10:26.833
Oh, you know what?
I didn't even ask you.

10:26.933 --> 10:32.033
do you get Skype here?

10:32.133 --> 10:33.333
Okay, it's almost time.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.300
Did you want to put on
a pair of pants?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.733
- No.
- All right.

10:35.833 --> 10:36.800
I just want to make sure
you know everything

10:36.900 --> 10:38.567
that there is to know
about Ace Shrift.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.533
He's a real cool customer,
you know.

10:40.633 --> 10:41.567
Like, he's not like anybody
you've ever met before.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.633
He's really confident
with women,

10:44.733 --> 10:47.600
kind of just knows his way
around the bases in life,

10:47.700 --> 10:49.367
you know, and--
sorry, I feel like--

10:49.467 --> 10:50.700
- Up a little higher.
- No.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.200
- I'm good.
- Okay, all right.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.467
- Do you mind if I just--sorry.
- Nah.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.033
- I just--
- Nah.

10:55.133 --> 10:56.367
Argh, I just feel--
No, it's not perfect!

10:56.467 --> 10:57.533
Oh, oh, God! Okay.

10:57.633 --> 10:58.567
All right, real quick.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.200
You have a PhD
in animal husbandry,

11:01.300 --> 11:02.767
and you've never had an STD.

11:02.867 --> 11:05.067
Oh, and your favorite author
is Agatha Christie.

11:05.167 --> 11:06.400
[stammering]
Okay.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.100
Hey, beautiful.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.367
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:09.467 --> 11:10.600
(Joe)
Sorry, that's the TV.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.600
Let me shut that off.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.267
Um, I have to confess,

11:16.367 --> 11:19.267
I kind of didn't believe
you were real.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.667
I mean, "Ace Shrift"?

11:21.767 --> 11:23.233
You know that your name
is an anagram

11:23.333 --> 11:24.467
for "farce shit," right?

11:24.567 --> 11:26.367
Yeah, I did,
but you know what else?

11:26.467 --> 11:27.900
What?

11:28.067 --> 11:29.733
I wondered the same way
about you, you sexy lady.

11:29.833 --> 11:30.900
(Forrest)
I worried that Suzanne
would know right away

11:31.067 --> 11:33.300
that the grinning simpleton
on her computer

11:33.400 --> 11:36.933
could not possibly be the
charming and witty Mr. Shrift.

11:37.067 --> 11:40.100
But Suzanne, perhaps distracted
by the sight of an athlete

11:40.200 --> 11:41.533
in his underpants,

11:41.633 --> 11:43.733
wasted no time
getting into her backstory.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.600
Not to get too much
into my backstory,

11:45.700 --> 11:46.867
but I spent a lot of years

11:46.967 --> 11:49.333
with the guy who I thought
I was meant to be with,

11:49.433 --> 11:51.300
and so much of that just

11:51.400 --> 11:53.600
turned out
to be like a gigantic detour.

11:53.700 --> 11:58.967
So I'm just really ready to--
to move on.

11:59.067 --> 12:04.233
(Forrest)
This emotional moment was more
than Joe Dale Jr. could handle.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.833
Hey, Suzanne,
my name's not Ace.

12:06.933 --> 12:08.167
- What?
- It's Joe Dale Jr.

12:08.267 --> 12:09.233
[whispers]
No! Hey!

12:09.333 --> 12:10.333
I play shortstop
for the Dodgers.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.300
I'm sorry I was dishonest,

12:12.400 --> 12:13.700
but if I use my real name,

12:13.800 --> 12:15.933
women aren't honest with me.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.067
I-I bet.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.967
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

12:19.067 --> 12:21.933
Whatever begins with dishonesty
always ends in a bad spot.

12:22.067 --> 12:23.200
Trust me, I know.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.767
I'm a baseball player.

12:24.867 --> 12:25.967
(Forrest)
And then Joe, for some reason,

12:26.067 --> 12:28.700
again told my ex-wife
that she seemed like...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.367
(both)
A great and very sexy lady.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.067
However...

12:32.167 --> 12:35.267
We probably shouldn't
contact each other anymore.

12:35.367 --> 12:36.267
(Suzanne)
No, I get it.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.733
I will miss seeing your face

12:38.833 --> 12:40.833
because it's just
really great-looking.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.833
- Good-bye.
- Bye, Ace Shrift.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.167
Oh!

12:44.267 --> 12:47.067
The cat has been fished!
[laughs]

12:47.100 --> 12:47.867
I was terrified!

12:47.967 --> 12:49.567
That whole time you were like,

12:49.667 --> 12:50.767
"I'm not Ace Shrift,
I'm Joe Dale,"

12:50.867 --> 12:52.100
I was like, "What are you doing?

12:52.200 --> 12:53.900
You're gonna give away
the whole catfish thing."

12:54.067 --> 12:55.300
[sighs] Thank you
for ending it like that.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.867
Just ending it.
It's over.

12:57.967 --> 13:00.533
That's the best $40,000
I've ever spent in my life.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.067
That was
a terrific investment.

13:02.133 --> 13:03.600
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.067
Well, you guys probably
have a lot going on and--

13:05.100 --> 13:07.800
- That's right.
- No, actually, no.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.067
- Yeah, we should get going.
- Yeah.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.567
Catfishing, just as Joe Dale Jr.
so eloquently put it,

13:13.667 --> 13:17.700
begins with dishonesty
and ends up in a bad spot.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.967
But there's a part
in the middle there

13:20.067 --> 13:22.733
where the catfisher tricks
his ex-wife into believing

13:22.833 --> 13:25.733
that she will find happiness
with some fictitious person,

13:25.833 --> 13:27.200
and though it's brief--

13:27.300 --> 13:29.933
and in retrospect,
it's pretty disgusting--

13:30.067 --> 13:30.600
in the moment,

13:30.700 --> 13:34.467
it's breathtaking.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.233
Catfishing, three stars.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.833
What is my next review,
please, A.J.?

13:41.933 --> 13:43.700
[trumpet fanfare]
- What are you doing?

13:43.800 --> 13:45.600
Well, Forrest, did you know
that in Civil War times

13:45.700 --> 13:47.267
people used to write letters
to each other

13:47.367 --> 13:48.533
on thinly sliced trees?

13:48.633 --> 13:50.900
- Paper, I know all about paper.
- Oh.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.100
- Yeah, big fan.
- [gasps]

13:52.200 --> 13:54.067
Our very first ever
old person pen pal...

13:54.100 --> 13:56.100
Mm-hmm.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.300
Is from Steamboat Springs,
Colorado.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.367
Oh, let me guess the zip code,

13:59.467 --> 14:01.800
80477.

14:01.900 --> 14:02.700
That actually was right.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.233
Yeah, I know all the zip codes.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.300
That's weird.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.800
"Dear Forrest MacNeil,

14:07.900 --> 14:08.667
"By the time you read this,

14:08.767 --> 14:10.733
- I'll be dead."
- Wow.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.567
"The gals
in my stitch-n-bitch group

14:12.667 --> 14:14.167
"are devastated about it

14:14.267 --> 14:16.733
"because they believe
my awful ghost will haunt them.

14:16.833 --> 14:19.667
"What's it like to spend
the night in a haunted house?

14:19.767 --> 14:22.333
Sincerely, I.L. Salazar."

14:22.433 --> 14:23.300
Huh.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.167
Well, here I go to find out

14:25.267 --> 14:27.267
what it's like to spend a night
in a haunted house.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.900
Might be
some ghosts there.

14:29.067 --> 14:32.067
(Forrest)
There is
a very creepy abandoned house

14:32.100 --> 14:33.733
in the neighborhood
where I grew up,

14:33.833 --> 14:34.800
and I headed there with my dad

14:34.900 --> 14:37.700
for the purposes
of father-son bonding

14:37.800 --> 14:39.867
and also because I was scared.

14:39.967 --> 14:41.533
I had forgotten
about the old Durretz house

14:41.633 --> 14:45.533
and its outlandish
and gruesome tale.

14:45.633 --> 14:47.767
A century ago,
we are told,

14:47.867 --> 14:50.967
a farmer murdered
his entire extended family,

14:51.067 --> 14:54.433
and he ground them up, and
then he fed them to his pigs.

14:54.533 --> 14:57.133
50 years after that,
they say,

14:57.233 --> 15:00.833
the house became haunted
by an unrelated ghost.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.800
[sirens wail]

15:02.900 --> 15:06.433
[mysterious music]

15:06.533 --> 15:09.667
*

15:09.767 --> 15:12.700
(Forrest)
Ghosts may or may not exist,

15:12.800 --> 15:16.533
but in our world, they do not.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.067
Our evening
in the Durretz house

15:18.100 --> 15:19.833
was therefore deeply boring,

15:19.933 --> 15:22.533
affording me the soundest sleep
I'd had in weeks.

15:22.633 --> 15:23.700
[snoring]

15:23.800 --> 15:26.200
But then...

15:26.300 --> 15:27.800
something happened.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.833
[snoring continues]

15:33.100 --> 15:34.067
[gasps]

15:36.933 --> 15:39.067
(Forrest)
Not an encounter
with the earthbound soul

15:39.167 --> 15:43.067
of a dead person
but an important idea.

15:43.133 --> 15:46.633
Perhaps inspired by my recent
experience with catfishing,

15:46.733 --> 15:48.500
I realized that
I did know a house

15:48.600 --> 15:52.133
that was actually haunted.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.200
This is the house where I lived
with my ex-wife, Suzanne,

15:54.300 --> 15:58.300
and my son, Eric.

15:58.400 --> 16:02.233
(Forrest)
This house holds the ghost
of what my life used to be.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.667
(Gene)
Forrest!

16:04.767 --> 16:06.067
(Forrest)
Gene!

16:06.100 --> 16:08.067
[chuckles]
You're kidding me.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.867
(Forrest)
My old neighbor
and former best friend, Gene,

16:10.967 --> 16:13.733
was like a vision
from a life I had lost.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.567
It's me, Forrest.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.533
Forrest MacNeil
from the past.

16:17.633 --> 16:18.833
Yeah, I remember.

16:18.933 --> 16:21.767
I'm just visiting
the old house.

16:21.867 --> 16:23.367
You're visiting
the old house right now?

16:23.467 --> 16:24.100
Yeah, mm-hmm.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.767
Hmm.

16:26.867 --> 16:29.133
Well, the people that live there
are on vacation,

16:29.233 --> 16:30.867
so you might want to come back
during the daytime

16:30.967 --> 16:35.833
'cause it's, uh...
bad to come at midnight.

16:35.933 --> 16:37.633
I understand.

16:37.733 --> 16:41.967
Okay, I guess this isn't really
my place anymore, huh?

16:42.067 --> 16:44.767
No, you--
you sold it.

16:44.867 --> 16:48.567
It was great
to see you again.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.267
And--and you're leaving now?

16:50.367 --> 16:52.133
Now, yes.

16:52.233 --> 16:54.067
I believe
I will see you again.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.667
[chuckles]

16:55.767 --> 17:01.400
*

17:01.500 --> 17:02.533
Oh, wow.

17:02.633 --> 17:05.200
The lock on this window
was always broken,

17:05.300 --> 17:06.800
so, assuming they
haven't fixed it,

17:06.900 --> 17:10.233
I should be able
to very carefully, very--

17:10.333 --> 17:12.833
[glass breaking]
- Aw, [bleep] [bleep]!

17:12.933 --> 17:14.633
God damn it.

17:14.733 --> 17:18.933
I'm in.
Come in.

17:19.067 --> 17:21.400
(Forrest)
My quest to spend a night

17:21.500 --> 17:24.800
in a haunted house had
brought me to hallowed ground.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.833
[door closes]

17:26.933 --> 17:32.067
This is where I lived with
my boy and the love of my live.

17:32.133 --> 17:34.533
They've made a lot
of bad choices here.

17:34.633 --> 17:37.500
It's terrible.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.367
Do they have any idea what came
before them in this space?

17:42.467 --> 17:44.767
Do they even care?
I don't know.

17:44.867 --> 17:48.467
But I do know they need to get
rid of that chair right away.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.967
Mmm!

17:56.067 --> 17:57.200
I feel like there's a realm

17:57.300 --> 18:02.733
where we didn't get divorced
right here.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.367
Suzanne and I
are still married.

18:04.467 --> 18:07.100
[sighs]

18:11.867 --> 18:14.067
There was a murder
in this kitchen,

18:14.133 --> 18:15.533
the murder of a marriage.

18:15.633 --> 18:19.533
[discordant piano notes]

18:19.633 --> 18:23.233
Oh, give me the strength
to go upstairs.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.200
Oh.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.067
[whispers]
What if I walk into that bedroom

18:29.167 --> 18:31.733
and Suzanne and I
are in there?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.167
Nope.

18:40.733 --> 18:42.267
It occurs to me now

18:42.367 --> 18:46.700
that there is a ghost
haunting this house tonight.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.200
It's me.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.833
Boo!

18:50.933 --> 18:52.100
(Forrest)
I had hoped that the alcohol

18:52.200 --> 18:53.800
would act
as a kind of talisman...

18:53.900 --> 18:55.167
Suzanne.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.833
(Forrest)
Warding off
the frightening specter

18:56.933 --> 18:58.067
of my slaughtered former life.

19:01.167 --> 19:04.433
But it only brought on
greater horrors.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.433
[creak]

19:06.533 --> 19:08.133
What was that?

19:09.767 --> 19:11.733
Did you hear that?

19:13.167 --> 19:14.733
[phone ringing]
- Oh!

19:17.667 --> 19:20.933
- Hello?
- [speaking foreign language]

19:21.067 --> 19:24.967
Who are you?
What do you want?

19:25.067 --> 19:26.800
Is that the language
they speak in hell?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.067
- [bleep].
[phone ringing]

19:29.133 --> 19:30.367
We got to get out of here.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.900
(Forrest)
And the horrors had just begun.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.133
[phone ringing]

19:40.833 --> 19:41.733
Gene?

19:41.833 --> 19:45.200
[phone continues ringing]

19:47.400 --> 19:49.100
- [screams]
- [screams]

19:49.200 --> 19:50.667
[knife stabs Forrest]

19:50.767 --> 19:52.667
Oh, God.
Oh!

19:55.067 --> 19:56.400
Oh.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.533
[shouting in native language]

19:57.633 --> 20:02.300
[groaning]

20:02.400 --> 20:04.933
Why did you do that to me?

20:05.033 --> 20:06.500
[crying]
Oh, God!

20:06.600 --> 20:07.300
Aah!

20:07.400 --> 20:10.500
[speaking native language]

20:10.600 --> 20:13.800
[sighs]

20:13.900 --> 20:16.167
That woman was Grandma Choi,
the matriarch of the family

20:16.267 --> 20:18.733
that bought the house
from Suzanne.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.533
She's afraid of flying,
so she didn't join

20:20.633 --> 20:22.433
the rest of her family
in Hawaii.

20:22.533 --> 20:24.633
She unfortunately mistook me
for an intruder

20:24.733 --> 20:27.000
and stabbed me
just above the navel,

20:27.100 --> 20:29.833
puncturing my large intestine.

20:29.933 --> 20:32.033
Oh, my God, Forrest.

20:32.133 --> 20:35.033
Well, I'm building up a pretty
good tolerance to physical pain,

20:35.133 --> 20:37.600
so no big deal.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.033
Now, my experience
with haunted houses taught me

20:40.133 --> 20:41.833
that we create phantoms

20:41.933 --> 20:45.233
to avoid thinking about our own
frightening or sad realities.

20:45.333 --> 20:49.867
Spending a night
in a haunted house, one star.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.933
So what happened to your dad?

20:56.033 --> 20:57.367
What do you mean?

20:57.467 --> 21:00.067
You left him
to spend a night alone

21:00.133 --> 21:02.967
in a real haunted house.

21:03.067 --> 21:04.333
Oh, yeah.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.200
Huh.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.467
Ooh, look in here.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.333
Why would a ghost choose
to live here, you know?

21:17.433 --> 21:18.533
Why do we assume
that ghosts want to live

21:18.633 --> 21:19.533
in dilapidated houses?

21:19.633 --> 21:21.167
Ghosts can go anywhere,
can't they?

21:21.267 --> 21:22.267
Yes.

21:22.367 --> 21:23.267
If I were a ghost,
I'd probably go live

21:23.367 --> 21:24.900
in Buckingham Palace.

21:25.067 --> 21:26.733
I think they like
the free maintenance.

21:26.833 --> 21:27.133
[laughs]
