WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.307
- Previously, on
The Kings of Napa.

00:03.351 --> 00:04.656
- Dad!
- Why did you lie?

00:04.700 --> 00:06.267
- If we're gonna open
this door back up,

00:06.310 --> 00:07.659
we gotta be honest
with each other.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.661
- She's still wearing
the wedding ring.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.663
- The August King.
- My girl's ghosting me

00:11.707 --> 00:13.665
because I let this family
get in my head.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.233
- Raise your hand
if you knew our grandmother

00:16.277 --> 00:18.322
was locked in
a mental institution.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.411
- We're being extorted.
We have everything riding

00:20.455 --> 00:22.109
on this wine.
This is our Hail Mary.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.501
- There's a woman that I like.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.155
She's married.
- Why am I being arrested?

00:25.199 --> 00:26.722
- Because you're
the extortionist.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.332
- Ma'am!
- Officer, no!

00:28.376 --> 00:31.031
[indistinct yelling]

00:33.033 --> 00:36.036
[soft music]

00:36.079 --> 00:39.561
[indistinct PA announcement]

00:41.389 --> 00:43.913
- Excuse me,
we're the Kings.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.306
Our dad was head
of surgery here.

00:45.349 --> 00:47.525
There's a goddamn entire wing
named after him.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.050
Do you have any information
on our aunt? Melanie Pierce?

00:50.093 --> 00:53.227
- The doctor will have
to give you that information.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.100
- Thank you, baby, for trying.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.797
We just have to pray on it.

00:58.841 --> 01:02.540
Yes, Reverend Banks reminded me
of the power of prayer.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.542
Now, come on.
We will come together

01:04.586 --> 01:08.720
and we will rely on our faith
as a family in these hard times.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.597
- I hope you're praying
for forgiveness.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.209
- For what?
- Guys, chill...

01:21.081 --> 01:24.432
- This. Us. Here.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.043
You pulled a fast one
on the family last night.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.393
Now Aunt Melanie
is fighting for her life
and Bridgette's in jail.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.265
- Shh! Are you serious?

01:31.308 --> 01:33.615
- Sorry.
- Bow your heads.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.270
- Was it worth it?

01:36.313 --> 01:39.838
- You are the one who let
your little sister friend,

01:39.882 --> 01:41.362
Bridgette, extort us,

01:41.405 --> 01:43.190
and now, you're mad at me
because I didn't let her

01:43.233 --> 01:44.408
run free with her
little secrets?

01:44.452 --> 01:46.584
- Stop it!
- Sorry, Mom.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.761
- I watched your father,
the love of my life,

01:49.805 --> 01:51.937
die in front of me
just a few months ago.

01:51.981 --> 01:55.245
And seeing Melanie
on that ground is too much.

01:55.289 --> 01:58.727
So, yes, I am worried
about my niece in jail.

01:58.770 --> 02:02.774
Right now, I would like to focus
on praying for my sister.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.429
Okay?
- Okay.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.257
[cellphone chiming]

02:09.825 --> 02:12.262
- This is unbelievable.
Put your phones away.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.699
- I'm sorry, but Steve Simms

02:14.743 --> 02:17.267
just RSVP'd to our
press critics event.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.400
- The Steve Simms?
- Yeah.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.358
- He only covers vineyards
in Italy.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.752
- I read somewhere that
he's over foreign wines,

02:23.795 --> 02:25.928
he's focusing on the top
vineyards in Napa, now.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.277
- Dope. We ready.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.453
I've been grinding
on our sample with Grace.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.325
We gotta rock this.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.806
- Dana, your text was so ominous

02:34.850 --> 02:36.939
I jumped on the first flight
from Vegas here.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.944
I knew something was wrong.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.164
Mel's been hella pale lately.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.818
But why the hell
is Bridgette in jail?

02:48.037 --> 02:49.473
Nah-ah...

02:49.517 --> 02:51.388
Kings don't do the joint.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.129
Have y'all tried
to bail her out?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.609
- I called.

02:54.652 --> 02:57.612
But it can take 48 hours
to schedule a bail hearing.

02:57.655 --> 03:03.705
And... And, Auntie,
as much as it hurts me,

03:03.748 --> 03:05.359
all the evidence is pointing
towards Bridgette.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.317
- But it's a guy
who's been calling.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.798
- She's not doing this alone.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.496
- Y'all are crazy
with this mess.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.586
And who's gonna tell her mama
she's been locked up?

03:15.630 --> 03:18.676
- Yvette, handle it.
Make it right.

03:21.244 --> 03:24.204
James.
- Good to see you, Vanessa.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.642
So, your sister has a condition

03:27.685 --> 03:29.426
called African
Sleeping Sickness.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.429
- What the hell is that?
African Sleeping Sickness?

03:32.473 --> 03:33.778
- It's a parasitic infection

03:33.822 --> 03:35.345
caused by the bite
of a tsetse fly.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.173
It's not common
in this country.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.219
She likely contracted it
overseas.

03:39.915 --> 03:43.527
The infection has crossed
into the brain.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.356
So, unfortunately,
she has slipped into a coma.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.316
We are doing everything we can.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.580
But... she has
a daughter, doesn't she?

03:52.623 --> 03:55.060
- Yes... Bridgette.

03:55.104 --> 03:58.281
And we will make sure
she gets here soon.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.978
Right, y'all?

04:01.328 --> 04:02.503
- Good.

04:02.546 --> 04:06.550
'Cause... she might want
to be prepared.

04:06.594 --> 04:09.423
- For what?
Be straight up, dude.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.600
- As I said, we're doing
everything we can.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.962
[theme music]

04:56.687 --> 04:59.037
[panting]

05:02.650 --> 05:06.567
- Maybe... talking about it
might help.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.047
- I don't know.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.441
Things just don't
look good for Aunt Mel.

05:11.485 --> 05:14.618
And my mom, I'm so worried
about her.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.317
We had to send her home from
the hospital to rest.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.319
- Yeah, that's a lot.

05:20.189 --> 05:24.454
I still can't believe you guys
called the cops on Bridge.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.022
And got her arrested?
- Okay. Dana did it,

05:27.065 --> 05:28.676
and I'm still pissed
at him for it.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.242
But in the grand scheme
of things,

05:30.286 --> 05:31.505
it was the right move.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.638
- I mean, do you really believe
your sister is jacking you

05:34.682 --> 05:36.031
for a 150 grand a month?

05:36.074 --> 05:38.947
- Bridgette's been acting
so differently, and I...

05:38.990 --> 05:41.993
I don't know. This whole thing
just breaks my heart.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.346
- Look, I get it.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.826
We all grew up together.

05:48.870 --> 05:52.439
I mean, why would she do it?
- Spite maybe?

05:52.482 --> 05:54.963
- I see y'all still have
that weird dynamic.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.400
You do the bestie thing,
no doubt.

05:57.444 --> 06:01.491
But underneath the surface,
there's always this little-bitty
jealousy between you two.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.753
[scoffing]
- Okay.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.189
- Y'all fought for Daddy's
attention.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.061
Even before either of you
knew he was her daddy.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.846
- Bridgette is not as innocent
as she plays.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.545
She's gamey, and Daddy
always fell for it.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.285
- See?
[scoffing]

06:13.329 --> 06:17.028
- Okay. Case in point, she knew
we were sisters for years

06:17.072 --> 06:19.857
and never said a word.
What's that about?

06:19.901 --> 06:23.208
- August, maybe she had
a good reason.

06:23.252 --> 06:26.255
- You know, this is really,
really hard for me.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.606
And I just wish I knew
that I had your support.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.740
All of the hard evidence
points to her lying.

06:33.784 --> 06:36.961
- Hey, come here, I'm with you.
[footsteps approaching]

06:37.005 --> 06:39.181
And I'm sorry, babe,
but as an attorney,

06:39.224 --> 06:40.748
I cannot jump to conclusions.

06:40.791 --> 06:44.404
Bridge deserves an investigation
and fair trial.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.319
- And as President
of House of Kings,

06:47.363 --> 06:51.062
I have to protect the company
my father died for.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.586
This killed him.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.588
And now, it's on me to fix it.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.851
You know what? You were wrong.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.027
Talking about it didn't help.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.510
- How did I not know
she was sick?

07:03.553 --> 07:05.468
What are the doctors saying?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.078
- It's touch and go, baby.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.341
[sighing]
- I gotta get out of here!

07:09.385 --> 07:12.040
- Looks like you got some
serious issues of your own

07:12.083 --> 07:12.954
to deal with first.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.086
- Why the hell does Dana think

07:15.130 --> 07:17.915
I'd squeeze money
from my own family?

07:17.959 --> 07:20.091
- It's complicated.
- He's wrong.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.311
And I'll show him. I just need
to have my bail hearing

07:22.354 --> 07:24.226
to get the hell out of here.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.881
- Bridgette,

07:26.924 --> 07:29.797
the fam has been building a case
against you for a minute.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.583
- But August told them
that it's not true, right?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.499
August begged me to come back
to the vineyard,

07:36.543 --> 07:38.632
said that we were sisters.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.547
- She got too many people
yappin' in her ear.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.942
It's a lot of pressure
filling Reggie's shoes.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.858
She feels betrayed.
- I didn't betray her!

07:47.902 --> 07:49.469
She's backstabbing me.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.949
Who the hell
is she turning into?

07:52.820 --> 07:55.387
You don't think I'm
the extortionist too, do you?

07:55.431 --> 07:56.519
- No.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.522
Out of all my brother's kids,

08:00.305 --> 08:02.656
you remind me of him the most.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.268
You'd never betray his legacy.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.488
They got it wrong.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.970
- Thank you, Auntie.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.672
Now, I need two favors.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.631
Find me a good lawyer...

08:21.675 --> 08:24.068
And get August's ass down here.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.809
I need to look her
in the eyes

08:25.853 --> 08:27.942
to see the devil
I'm dealing with.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.471
- Christian, you had your driver
roll up to my job,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.038
I thought I was being kidnapped.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.736
- Well, no more Ubers
for you, bae,

08:39.780 --> 08:43.435
and I wanted to see you ASAP.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.873
[soft music playing]

08:47.439 --> 08:50.181
- We just saw each other
for a whole weekend in L.A.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.967
- I just don't wanna mess up
things with you again, Shiela.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.665
You don't care that I'm a King.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.842
And no one has ever
checked me like you do.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.192
Brothers need that sometimes.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.369
- Well, I keep shit real.

09:04.413 --> 09:09.157
And the real-real is,
you are more than just a King.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.335
You're your own man.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.294
And you're about to be
on your glow up

09:16.338 --> 09:17.905
with your bourbon business.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.081
Just watch.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.346
- I'm too busy watching you.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.791
- Then watch.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.712
[indistinct chatter]

09:44.105 --> 09:46.237
- Hey, honey,
did you sign the P.O.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.327
for the Comus Brothers visit?
- Yup. Unlike the others,

09:49.371 --> 09:51.025
I do my job.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.244
- I was working to keep my mind
from worrying about Melanie.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.637
What about Rose?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.552
Have you heard anything
from her? Has she called?

09:56.596 --> 09:57.945
- Nope.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.164
I've moved on.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.253
- I know you're hurting.
You're upset.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.472
- Do I look upset?

10:03.515 --> 10:05.430
I did what you asked
and prayed about it.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.911
It's gonna take more than this
to bring me down.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.913
And I'm about
to score double points

10:09.957 --> 10:11.393
when Bridgette is prosecuted.

10:11.436 --> 10:14.483
- Well, revenge is a double-edge
sword, honey.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.703
- I learned from the best.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.097
- Well, I've been
sliced and diced,

10:20.141 --> 10:22.012
and I wish I could go back
and change some things.

10:22.056 --> 10:25.102
Honey, I just think
you need to talk about this.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.365
- Fine.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.671
The woman who I adore

10:28.715 --> 10:30.934
and who shocked everyone
by loving me

10:30.978 --> 10:33.328
is debating whether
she likes dick anymore.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.504
Unless you can tell me
how to grow a pair of boobs,

10:35.547 --> 10:36.766
I think I'm screwed.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.072
- Dana, you're being
harsh right now

10:38.115 --> 10:39.987
and I know you don't mean this.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.731
- Ready for your massage,
Mr. King?

10:49.344 --> 10:51.259
- Aunt Melanie needs you.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.348
I'm fine.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.398
[rhythmic music]

11:01.225 --> 11:02.792
- Are you crazy?

11:02.836 --> 11:04.707
You know I didn't do this.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.275
- The poison, the drill,

11:07.318 --> 11:10.234
the calls picked up
by a cellphone tower

11:10.278 --> 11:12.019
near your house.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.586
Who are you working with?

11:14.630 --> 11:16.588
[sighing]
You've known my dad

11:16.632 --> 11:18.721
was your father for years.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.723
That is motive.
And we have proof.

11:20.767 --> 11:24.684
- Proof? How? Unless...

11:26.555 --> 11:28.862
Did you bug my place?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.212
Were you watching me?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.172
Way to play dirty, sis.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.785
- I had to protect my family.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.048
- I am family.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.528
- How did you know about Dad?

11:43.572 --> 11:47.532
- Oh, you think Daddy and I
had our own little secret.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.405
Relax, he didn't know I knew.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.192
Funny, you say you love me,
but I sometimes feel like

11:55.236 --> 11:58.848
you'd sacrifice me like a lamb,
given the chance.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.808
You have it all...

12:01.851 --> 12:03.635
The name, the recognition.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.247
- The evidence is solid.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.641
- You're in over your head.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.427
You're drowning, aren't you?

12:14.211 --> 12:18.041
You're trying to be
the big strong leader

12:18.085 --> 12:19.913
by taking me down?

12:22.916 --> 12:25.266
Well, be prepared for a fight.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.445
Guard!

12:30.488 --> 12:32.926
[dramatic music]

12:37.495 --> 12:39.149
[insects chirping]

12:40.629 --> 12:42.370
[soft music playing]

12:42.413 --> 12:43.980
[indistinct chatter]

12:44.024 --> 12:46.766
- What's good, Groesbeck?
- I got a table for you.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.376
- Thank you.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.466
- I heard about Bridgette.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.337
Arrested?
- What?

12:53.381 --> 12:54.686
How? It just happened.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.732
- Napa is beautiful people
and crazy money,

12:56.776 --> 12:59.691
which equals knives out
and gossip flying.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.172
- I never peeped her
for the extortionist-type

13:02.216 --> 13:03.913
who'd try and kill her own mom.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.654
- Bridgette didn't try
to kill Aunt Melanie.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.525
She fainted.
- Oh. My bad.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.919
That's word on the street.
- Well, it's wrong.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.443
You tell them to focus
on the farmers markets and wine.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.706
Because Bridgette
is not that kind of person.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.796
- Sorry, guys.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.580
I know that.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.757
Let me know when
you're ready to order.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.631
- These crazy rumors
aren't good for business.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.155
Maybe it's smarter
we asked the D.A.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.940
not to pursue charges
and sweep this under the rug.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.507
- Look who's flipping.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.987
- With everything
we know she did?

13:34.030 --> 13:36.337
- Do we really want
her to go to prison?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.642
- That's the whole point.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.731
I'm over you,
Ms. Play Both Sides.

13:39.775 --> 13:42.299
Dad maintained order.

13:42.343 --> 13:45.825
- The biz needs your focus
and grind right now, August.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.435
We did the right thing.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.828
I love Bridge, too.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.221
But you gotta
pick a side and stick.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.313
- I'm with y'all.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.967
- Finally.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.143
Now, let's show Napa who's boss
at the press event tomorrow.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.276
[dramatic music]

14:09.196 --> 14:12.634
- Grace, our renowned winemaker,
has showed out yet again.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.985
King's Heritage is set to debut
in four months,

14:16.029 --> 14:19.119
delivering 5,000 bottles
early this year.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.860
- It's beautifully designed.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.166
Sexy.
- Makes you want it.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.428
Desire it.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.083
- We have two dozen pre-orders
in five-star

14:27.127 --> 14:30.173
and Michelin eateries
in the U.S. and abroad.

14:30.217 --> 14:33.263
- Jason Collins of L&P
is our exclusive distributor.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.352
- Best in the biz,
this must be good.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.268
- Yeah. No one does
Chardonnay like us.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.967
But King's Heritage
will undoubtedly

14:41.010 --> 14:43.752
win us another
Sommeliers Choice Award

14:43.795 --> 14:46.015
and medal
at the prestigious IWC.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.452
I'm not talking bronze.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.238
This is gold.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.023
- August, this is your
personal baby, correct?

14:54.067 --> 14:56.025
- Yes.
- As new president,

14:56.069 --> 14:57.940
is this your attempt
to put your own stamp

14:57.984 --> 14:59.289
on the family business?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.335
[laughing]
- Yes. I have a great new vision

15:01.378 --> 15:04.207
for House of Kings,
so watch out, Napa!

15:04.251 --> 15:05.948
[chuckling]
Shall we taste?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.994
[rhythmic music]

15:08.037 --> 15:10.561
[indistinct chatter]

15:10.605 --> 15:12.433
Guys, I think it's going well.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.827
Mom, oh my gosh.
- Hey.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.525
- Oh, I'm so happy you made it.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.135
How's Aunt Mel doing?

15:19.179 --> 15:21.398
- It's a waiting game.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.487
You know... Hi, honey.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.315
They won't let me see her.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.275
Anyway, this is going well.

15:28.318 --> 15:31.756
I mean, Mr. Simms
seems to be loving it.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.150
- The new president's
baby is a hit.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.413
- Dana, come on,
it's not like that.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.025
- Dad never took credit
for our company's success.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.766
We're a team.
- We're all important

15:41.810 --> 15:43.464
to Heritage's success.

15:43.507 --> 15:46.684
- And I know that.
This is about all of us.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.077
We did it.

15:48.121 --> 15:51.472
- Is that that reporter
from Asset Makers?

15:51.515 --> 15:52.603
Witch.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.128
So what,
she's a wine critic now?

15:57.521 --> 16:02.091
- Everyone,
the King family, all of us,

16:02.135 --> 16:04.964
would like to thank you
for coming today.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.487
- What's your strategy
going head-to-head

16:06.530 --> 16:08.924
with Sean & Shawn's
new dessert wine?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.187
- We're the only vineyard
producing a dessert wine

16:11.231 --> 16:13.233
in the region.
- Seems like they're on trend.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.974
Your competitor just held
a hush-hush

16:15.017 --> 16:16.497
private tasting last week.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.282
Their Dolce Crimson comes out
in just three months.

16:19.326 --> 16:22.329
This is very good,
but theirs has a similar taste.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.374
- It's an exquisite dark plum,

16:24.418 --> 16:25.941
with raspberry
and chocolate melt,

16:25.985 --> 16:27.421
and good grip.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.379
[voice echoing]: And a much
better price point.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.425
[Bridgette]: You're drowning,
aren't you?

16:31.468 --> 16:34.384
I am family.
Way to play dirty, sis.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.386
You say you love me,
but sometimes...

16:36.430 --> 16:38.693
[Kelvin]: Do you really believe
your sister is jacking you...

16:38.736 --> 16:40.434
- You know I didn't do this!

16:41.174 --> 16:43.306
- So, how are you going
to compete with Sean & Shawn?

16:43.350 --> 16:46.744
- Well, enjoy, everyone.
Thank you.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.485
- Cheers.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.359
- Sean & Shawn
have lost their minds.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.189
[rhythmic music]

16:58.104 --> 17:00.019
[tires screeching]

17:05.328 --> 17:07.374
Hey! This is what I get

17:07.417 --> 17:08.853
for sharing my intel
on Bridgette?

17:08.897 --> 17:10.681
- You're jacking our idea
on dessert wine?

17:10.725 --> 17:12.553
- Thanks to the smooth criminal,

17:12.596 --> 17:14.381
AKA fam-bam Bridgette

17:14.424 --> 17:16.513
for spillin' the tea
on your dessert wine plans.

17:16.557 --> 17:17.775
- It's such a good idea,

17:17.819 --> 17:19.342
we decided to get
our Madame C.J. Walker on,

17:19.386 --> 17:22.302
and beat you to the punch.
- Dead this... now.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.955
- We're not stopping anything

17:23.999 --> 17:27.350
after what your conniving
sister did.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.135
This is business,

17:29.178 --> 17:31.920
so get the hell off
our property, assholes.

17:31.963 --> 17:35.054
- Alright. We'll bounce.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.495
But don't let all this
Balenciaga fool you.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.063
I ain't no punk.
And no one...

17:44.106 --> 17:46.500
does our family dirty
and gets away with it.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.416
You better watch your backs.
- Is that a threat?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.897
- Let's go, Christian.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.423
You'll be getting a cease
and desist tomorrow morning.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.121
[rhythmic music]

18:06.172 --> 18:10.654
- Bridgette is determined
to destroy us. I trusted her.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.222
I told her my plans, my dreams,

18:13.266 --> 18:15.050
and she used them against me.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.009
- Some things must be kept
close to the vest, honey.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.881
- And to think I felt bad,

18:19.924 --> 18:22.797
even responsible
when I went to see her.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.059
No, no.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.888
She wants to play me.
But I'm not the one.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.195
It's on.
Auntie Yvette, you call Jason

18:29.238 --> 18:30.935
and tell him we're going
to market two months early.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.981
Christian, rally the crew,
I'm approving overtime.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.504
And Dana, get ready
to sign those checks.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.115
Sean and Shawn
want a competition?

18:36.158 --> 18:39.118
Well, they got one.
- I love this August.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.510
- Come through, big sis.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.077
- Don't worry. My boo's got you.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.471
Heritage's gonna outsell
the Shawns' swill.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.734
But I think you're wrong
about Bridgette.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.953
- Auntie.
- She's still family.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.085
- She can't be trusted.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.608
She knew all along about Dad

18:51.652 --> 18:52.914
and she kept it secret.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.611
- Reggie would never
have told her.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.960
He didn't want her
to feel ashamed.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.311
He loved her too much.
Poor baby.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.443
- She's a lying manipulator.
- Enough!

19:00.487 --> 19:03.968
Even if Bridgette did extort us,
so the hell what?

19:04.012 --> 19:05.405
Do you blame her?

19:05.448 --> 19:07.929
- Is this what a stroke
looks like?

19:07.972 --> 19:10.975
- Bridgette's parents
betrayed her and she retaliated.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.673
The girl has been
through enough.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.153
- We're not backing down.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.807
- I thought we learned something
being locked up

19:16.851 --> 19:18.287
in the production facility.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.420
We have to stop this.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.422
Isn't that what you said,
August?

19:22.465 --> 19:24.380
My sister is fighting
to survive.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.513
And Bridgette is like
a daughter to me.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.558
[laughing]

19:28.602 --> 19:31.170
- Look at you,
being more motherly to her

19:31.213 --> 19:32.649
than your own children.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.390
And you walked out on us.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.827
- You will respect me, Dana!

19:37.350 --> 19:39.482
No wonder Rose is gone!

19:45.706 --> 19:48.361
- The police are raiding
Bridgette's house tomorrow.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.624
You're wrong about this.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.454
[soft music]

20:08.250 --> 20:10.209
Look at that.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.514
Police are at Bridgette's house.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.908
And now, we can
get back to work.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.700
- Bridgette needs
a good attorney.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.528
I can't represent her.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.095
- Melanie might not make it

20:27.138 --> 20:30.272
and her daughter needs
to be with her ASAP,

20:30.316 --> 20:32.013
before it's too late.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.493
- It's just a conflict
of interest.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.451
[scoffing]

20:35.495 --> 20:37.061
- August.

20:37.105 --> 20:40.282
Ya'll all booed up now,
so you can't see straight,

20:40.326 --> 20:42.110
'cause you tappin' that ass.

20:43.546 --> 20:44.721
- Um...

20:44.765 --> 20:46.070
- Now, you didn't have
this issue

20:46.114 --> 20:47.898
when you were
representing Melanie.

20:47.942 --> 20:50.597
- That was before me and August
had gotten serious.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.555
- Now, if you're serious,

20:52.599 --> 20:54.557
you should know deep down

20:54.601 --> 20:56.733
that she doesn't want her sister
in the clink

20:56.777 --> 20:58.213
fighting off Bertha.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.041
She just can't say it,
because she's president

21:00.084 --> 21:02.435
of House of Kings,
and the struggle is real.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.741
- Yes, but this is different.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.743
Look, Ms. King,
I care about Bridgette,

21:06.787 --> 21:09.137
and honestly, I'm worried.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.660
My legal expertise,

21:10.704 --> 21:12.488
it tells me
they got the wrong person.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.099
And I hear the DA's planning
to make an example out of her.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.841
I can refer her to
one of my fantastic colleagues.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.627
- They won't defend Bridgette
the way you will.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.498
You're family, Kelvin.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.935
Should I remind you
of all the things

21:24.979 --> 21:26.763
the Kings have done for you?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.591
Who got you out of foster care?

21:28.635 --> 21:30.593
Family protects family.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.639
It's funny...

21:33.379 --> 21:37.426
Black folks getting killed
on video every other day,

21:37.470 --> 21:39.167
no convictions,

21:39.210 --> 21:41.430
but they want
to lock up my niece?

21:41.474 --> 21:42.997
No, sir.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.218
This is one case where
Black lives will matter.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.918
- Look, no promises.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.833
But let me do a deep dive
into the evidence

21:52.876 --> 21:54.225
and see what they got on her.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.140
- You got one hour.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.446
I got the bail money.

21:57.490 --> 22:01.581
All I need is you,
and so does August.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.022
- I got it.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.807
I got it.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.114
- Well, this ends
our art and wine tour,

22:13.157 --> 22:15.551
but head with me, we're going
to head to the tasting room

22:15.595 --> 22:16.987
where you will get lit

22:17.031 --> 22:19.947
on flights of the best
House of King wines.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.342
And in the words of my son,
our deejay is fire!

22:23.385 --> 22:25.213
[laughing]
Enjoy!

22:25.256 --> 22:27.476
Have some fun,
don't hurt yourself.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.695
- Beautiful out here.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.740
[chuckling]
- Thank you.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.264
[birds chirping]

22:34.918 --> 22:36.616
Honey, what's wrong?

22:36.659 --> 22:39.619
- The cops found more evidence
during the raid at Bridgette's.

22:39.662 --> 22:42.404
The poison, a blueprint
of the vineyard,

22:42.448 --> 22:44.841
and the same chocolates
that were found in your bedroom.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.974
[cellphone ringing]

22:49.280 --> 22:52.588
- I cannot believe
this is happening.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.634
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you, Mom.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.637
- Despite what I may feel
about Bridgette,

22:57.680 --> 22:59.639
you should follow
your own conscience.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.031
We all have to.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.773
- And that's why I hired
Kelvin to represent her.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.384
- What?
- I'm telling you the truth

23:05.427 --> 23:08.256
'cause I don't fool
with moving in the dark.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.824
This family has a gang
of secrets as it is.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.826
- Hello, ladies.
Good to see you again.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.523
[cellphone ringing]
- Y'all remember Jason,

23:14.567 --> 23:16.133
our wine distributor?

23:16.177 --> 23:18.962
- Excuse me,
I need to take this.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.575
- Let me get this straight,
my man Kelvin

23:22.618 --> 23:24.533
is sneaking around
behind my back,

23:24.577 --> 23:25.839
and defending Bridgette?

23:25.882 --> 23:27.231
- August, let me explain.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.191
I couldn't stand by
and let you and Bridgette

23:30.234 --> 23:31.671
destroy each other.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.543
- Yvette, when I said handle it,
I didn't mean Kelvin!

23:34.587 --> 23:36.458
- Whoa, whoa.
You knew about this?

23:36.502 --> 23:38.634
You were involved in this too?

23:38.678 --> 23:41.594
Mom, you always do this.
- Stop.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.899
This is all me.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.727
There's lots of things
in this life

23:44.771 --> 23:46.076
I can let fall by the wayside,

23:46.120 --> 23:48.078
but I'll be called home to Jesus

23:48.122 --> 23:50.429
fighting to keep
this family together.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.908
- Yvette...

23:51.952 --> 23:53.910
can I speak to you for a sec?

23:53.954 --> 23:55.695
- We're gonna go on
our picnic, babe,

23:55.738 --> 23:58.175
but the drama is at 100!

24:00.221 --> 24:02.876
- Well, you might
wanna brace for more.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.924
That was my office.

24:07.968 --> 24:11.101
My bosses are making me
drop King's Heritage.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.755
I can't sell your dessert wine.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.191
- What?

24:14.235 --> 24:16.498
Why the hell not?!
- I'm sorry, ladies,

24:16.542 --> 24:17.760
my hands are tied.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.109
- You better start talking,
brother.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.850
- We signed another
vineyard today.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.765
I'm now the official distributor

24:22.809 --> 24:24.854
for Sean & Shawn's
new dessert wine.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.292
[dramatic music]

24:35.561 --> 24:39.826
- And that asshole judge
called me a threat to society.

24:39.869 --> 24:42.132
How the hell did you
get him to grant bail?

24:42.176 --> 24:43.656
- I'm not some shoddy attorney.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.484
Your boy got mad skills.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.137
- Thank God.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.574
[chuckling]

24:48.617 --> 24:50.663
Please just take me to see
my mom at the hospital.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.448
- Bridge, her condition
hasn't changed.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.797
She's still critical.

24:54.841 --> 24:57.104
You should go home,
take a shower,

24:57.147 --> 24:58.714
and then see if they'll
let you see her.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.847
Look, I'm going to be
real with you.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.849
These are some serious charges.

25:02.892 --> 25:05.460
Bridge, the police
have searched your house.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.853
- You think I'm going to prison?

25:06.896 --> 25:08.419
- On the surface,
all the evidence points to you

25:08.463 --> 25:10.204
trying to run a scam
in your family.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.771
- It's bullshit!

25:11.814 --> 25:14.034
- I see holes in the case.
But I need to know everything.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.644
- I'm not hiding anything.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.080
[cellphone ringing]

25:20.997 --> 25:23.913
Your bae doesn't know
you're my lawyer, does she?

25:23.957 --> 25:26.350
- Your Aunt Yvette promised
not to say anything

25:26.394 --> 25:28.091
until I get a chance
to tell her myself.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.571
- Well then, you should
tell her soon

25:29.615 --> 25:31.921
because, clearly, you don't
know my Aunt Yvette.

25:31.965 --> 25:34.837
- Wait!
You can't just abandon us.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.665
We'll make changes
to the label,

25:36.709 --> 25:39.538
put half-naked ladies in afros

25:39.581 --> 25:42.105
laid out on some Cadillacs

25:42.149 --> 25:44.238
and really shake up the game.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.413
- It's been done.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.110
- How in the hell
am I supposed to find

25:47.154 --> 25:49.765
another distributor
this late in the process?

25:49.809 --> 25:52.551
- I'm sorry,
but this isn't my choice.

25:52.594 --> 25:55.641
Besides your family drama
being all in the news,

25:55.684 --> 25:57.207
my bosses crunched the numbers

25:57.251 --> 25:59.775
and realized that
Sean & Shawn's dessert wines

25:59.819 --> 26:02.691
had better profit margins
and is almost as good.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.388
- It's 'cause we Black.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.347
The Kings are part
of a burgeoning

26:06.390 --> 26:09.045
but small market
of Black owners in Napa.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.700
I know when my business
is being sabotaged.

26:11.744 --> 26:14.050
- No one is sabotaging anything.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.704
- You can't gaslight me.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.706
Reggie went through hell

26:17.750 --> 26:19.447
trying to get
this company going.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.884
He put up with racist ass
distributors

26:21.928 --> 26:23.930
because they all assume

26:23.973 --> 26:26.236
that Black consumers
were wine ignorant.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.413
Now, it's true, we put ice
in our wine sometimes,

26:29.457 --> 26:30.893
but we keep it cute.

26:30.937 --> 26:33.069
And watch, it's just
a matter of time

26:33.113 --> 26:34.897
before white folks
steal that too

26:34.941 --> 26:36.769
like Kim Kardashian
and cornrows.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.205
[chuckling]

26:39.641 --> 26:41.469
They're just bigots.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.733
Thinking we only want
really sweet wine

26:44.777 --> 26:48.650
or the suits presume
we can't afford a decent label.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.434
So they don't market to us.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.306
But even though only
five percent of vineyards

26:52.349 --> 26:53.524
are Black-owned,

26:53.568 --> 26:55.788
the Kings will prevail.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.879
- I know this looks bad, babe,

26:59.922 --> 27:02.664
but this isn't
a Black Lives Matter,

27:02.708 --> 27:04.492
as-salamu alaykum issue.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.276
This is business.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.105
And you don't need
to be so hysterical.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.498
- Just 'cause you work
for those crackers,

27:10.541 --> 27:12.979
don't mean they ain't racist,
snack cake.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.157
- You're right.
But let me ask you this,

27:17.200 --> 27:21.161
were you about to kick me
to the curb? Hmm?

27:26.253 --> 27:28.429
I hope you're not dating me
for my position.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.349
- You know that's my spot.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.701
Mmm, a little to the left.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.662
And the only position
I'm dating you for, brother,

27:43.705 --> 27:45.141
is horizontal

27:45.185 --> 27:48.101
and that has nothing to do
with House of Kings wine.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.712
- Well, I'm happy to hear that.

27:50.756 --> 27:53.019
[chuckling]

27:55.848 --> 27:57.501
- Damn cops.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.895
[rap music]

28:40.936 --> 28:42.677
[sighing]

28:42.721 --> 28:44.461
[car horns honking]

28:48.814 --> 28:50.337
[phone ringing]

28:50.380 --> 28:51.599
- Hey.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.994
- If I can't trust you,
who can I trust?

28:55.037 --> 28:57.431
- Look, I've tried to reach you
several times.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.780
Check your phone.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.782
- What is there to talk about?

29:00.826 --> 29:02.436
You representing Bridgette

29:02.479 --> 29:05.047
completely undermines
my authority as a leader.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.397
My thirsty brothers

29:07.441 --> 29:08.964
are gonna vote me
off this island

29:09.008 --> 29:10.618
if I don't put Bridgette
in her place.

29:10.661 --> 29:12.620
I thought you said
you were with me.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.491
- And I am.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.102
But I got a closer look
at the evidence

29:16.145 --> 29:17.843
and something is just
not adding up.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.496
- The calls alone prove guilt.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.108
- I'm meeting with the DA to see
if they have anything solid.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.762
- Okay.
- August, come on.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.068
I care about you deeply
and I do not want to lose you.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.417
But you have got to understand,

29:27.461 --> 29:29.376
I've gotta do
what I think is right.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.338
- And you've got to understand

29:35.382 --> 29:38.559
that I can't be with a man
I can't trust.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.343
[sighing]

29:47.307 --> 29:50.049
- Ms. Pierce is facing
eight felonies,

29:50.092 --> 29:51.398
a possible 20 years.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.748
Our search of her home
resulted in some

29:53.792 --> 29:55.445
pretty damaging evidence.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.796
- Yeah. I just learned about
the shady warrant and the raid.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.536
If the evidence is anything
like the rest,

29:59.580 --> 30:02.017
it's flimsy
and inadmissible, at best.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.802
- I heard Judge Reynolds
still holds a grudge

30:03.845 --> 30:06.108
since that arsonist
set his family's vineyard

30:06.152 --> 30:07.631
on fire in 2018.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.329
Hope you don't land
in his courtroom.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.113
- Mmm. Out for blood, are we?

30:11.157 --> 30:13.376
- This is more than just
justice for the Kings
and Sean & Shawn.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.248
Ms. Pierce's threat
to one vineyard

30:15.291 --> 30:17.293
is a threat to the entire
community of Napa.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.512
- She's being framed.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.340
- Her fingerprints
are all over it.

30:20.383 --> 30:21.907
- That's because she's worked
on the vineyard for years.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.822
[scoffing]
- I would love

30:23.865 --> 30:26.868
to take this to court,
but I like you, Kelvin.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.348
So, let me talk to my team

30:28.391 --> 30:29.915
and see what we can do
about a deal.

30:29.958 --> 30:30.872
- We're not taking a plea.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.526
- That's a mistake.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.136
She doesn't have a leg
to stand on

30:34.180 --> 30:35.659
with the latest evidence.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.444
It's a gift from on high.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.967
- Look, I'm entitled
to discovery.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.534
What the hell did you find?

30:48.368 --> 30:50.500
- Make sure y'all prune
those vines correctly.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.894
- Yeah, the pruning
and our canopy management

30:52.938 --> 30:56.158
in this area will attract more
sunlight to the grape plants.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.118
- Hell must've frozen over.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.684
You finally know
what you're doing.

31:00.728 --> 31:01.990
[chuckling]

31:02.034 --> 31:03.600
- I liked you better
in the hospital.

31:03.644 --> 31:04.863
- Too bad.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.299
The warden is back now.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.822
- Keep running your mouth,
I'll have the family

31:07.866 --> 31:11.173
cancel our promise to officially
label your own wine.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.654
- Your family is lucky
I didn't sue y'all.

31:13.697 --> 31:16.309
Unfortunately, I'm a man
who enjoys a good bribe.

31:16.352 --> 31:19.225
[chuckling]
- You and me both, player.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.357
[indistinct chatter]

31:23.403 --> 31:25.144
- Thank you, Dana!

31:25.187 --> 31:27.407
[rhythmic music playing]

31:37.025 --> 31:38.592
[sighing]

31:42.161 --> 31:44.511
[intriguing music]

31:49.255 --> 31:51.083
[sighing]

31:51.126 --> 31:53.389
[Rose]: Hi. I'm unavailable
to take your call,

31:53.433 --> 31:55.522
please leave a message.
I'll catch you later!

31:55.565 --> 31:58.394
[beeping]
- Yo, Rose, it's Christian.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.309
I don't know if you're
boo'd up somewhere

32:00.353 --> 32:03.138
with some scrub, or having
a midlife British crisis,

32:03.182 --> 32:05.575
but you have my brother
out here broken!

32:05.619 --> 32:07.926
Have you forgotten
about the good times?

32:07.969 --> 32:09.928
Dana took you to Mykonos,

32:09.971 --> 32:12.365
held your hand when we
jumped off the Jaws Bridge

32:12.408 --> 32:13.975
on Martha's Vineyard,

32:14.019 --> 32:16.369
dressed you in runway Versace.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.938
But look, Rose,

32:19.981 --> 32:22.941
on the real, Dana misses you.

32:22.984 --> 32:25.944
He's drowning his sorrows
in hot massage therapists!

32:25.987 --> 32:27.902
That's just not his style.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.992
I remember how cold-hearted
and immature

32:31.036 --> 32:32.428
he was before he met you.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.561
You helped make him
a better man

32:34.604 --> 32:36.432
like Helen Hunt
did to Jack Nicholson

32:36.476 --> 32:38.217
in that old movie.

32:39.522 --> 32:43.265
Please, Rose, just come home.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.969
- I thought we agreed,
no surprises.

32:51.839 --> 32:53.623
- What?
I told you everything.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.278
- The DA traced calls
from your phone

32:56.322 --> 32:58.715
that line up with the ones
received by the Kings

32:58.759 --> 33:01.457
from the extortionist.
- That's impossible.

33:01.501 --> 33:04.417
- My relationship with August
is on ice

33:04.460 --> 33:06.375
because I'm defending you.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.986
- They must've cloned my phone

33:08.029 --> 33:09.683
and made those calls,
or something.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.337
I'm not working with someone.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.339
I'm being framed.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.211
- It's too risky to go to trial.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.822
Look, they're offering
you a deal.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.303
And I advise you
to think about your mom.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.957
You don't know what kind
of care she'll need.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.090
- My mom wouldn't want me
to admit to something

33:25.133 --> 33:26.830
I didn't do.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.658
- Look, with these new calls,

33:28.702 --> 33:31.879
and all of the other evidence,
you could lose.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.317
The DA's offering
six months in jail,

33:35.361 --> 33:37.145
five months probation,

33:37.189 --> 33:39.017
and $500K in restitution.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.585
- They're trying
to send me in prison

33:42.629 --> 33:45.110
and demand
half a million dollars?!

33:45.153 --> 33:48.461
August is really
out of pocket with this one.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.509
- Sean & Shawn
want to see you fry, too.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.945
If you take the deal,

33:54.989 --> 33:57.078
and you tell them everything
that you know,

33:57.122 --> 33:59.385
the extortion felony
will be bumped down

33:59.428 --> 34:01.039
to a misdemeanor
after time served.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.866
But if you're found guilty,

34:02.910 --> 34:05.391
Bridgette, you're looking
at 20 years.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.219
[sighing]

34:12.746 --> 34:14.182
- If this wasn't me,

34:14.226 --> 34:18.012
if it was one of your
top clients at your firm,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.884
what would you
advise them to do?

34:23.974 --> 34:27.065
- Unfortunately, I would advise
them to take the plea.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.900
- Bridgette,
what are you doing here?

34:36.944 --> 34:39.207
- Your man filled me in
on the deal,

34:39.251 --> 34:40.295
if I plead guilty.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.863
Seriously,
what is wrong with y'all?

34:42.906 --> 34:44.430
August, you know
I didn't do this!

34:44.473 --> 34:46.040
- I know you're a liar.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.912
- Okay, so I lied about knowing
Uncle Reggie was my dad.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.089
- And why won't you tell me how?

34:58.792 --> 35:02.100
- Years ago, I overheard
my mom and Uncle...

35:02.796 --> 35:05.103
...Dad, on the phone.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.279
They were discussing
my college tuition.

35:07.322 --> 35:10.325
It sounded weird,
like a conversation
only parents would have.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.805
I completely bugged out.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.112
So one day, after he finished
his Starbucks,

35:14.155 --> 35:16.244
I pretended to toss the cup,

35:16.288 --> 35:19.595
but instead I gave it
to a friend who ran a DNA test.

35:19.639 --> 35:24.470
He is 99.9 % my father.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.081
I kept it a secret
because I knew

35:27.125 --> 35:28.865
it would destroy this family.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.738
You know I have always been
on a mission

35:31.781 --> 35:33.783
to find out more
about my father.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.611
And that I've always
been suspicious

35:35.655 --> 35:38.788
as to why my mom shared
so little about him with me.

35:38.832 --> 35:40.921
- It doesn't explain the poison,

35:40.964 --> 35:43.097
or the drill in your bag,
or the chocolate.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.404
- The workers and I
use that poison all the time

35:45.447 --> 35:47.797
to control the vegetation
under the trellis.

35:47.841 --> 35:51.105
The drill, I used for my art
and I'm allergic to chocolate!

35:51.149 --> 35:53.716
Remember when I snuck a piece
out of Auntie's bag

35:53.760 --> 35:55.283
and I broke out in hives?

35:55.327 --> 35:58.025
Why, of all things,
would I plant that?

35:58.068 --> 35:59.679
- And what about the calls?

35:59.722 --> 36:01.507
- I never made those calls!

36:01.550 --> 36:03.117
- But someone you know did.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.466
[sighing]

36:04.510 --> 36:07.904
You told Sean & Shawn
about our dessert wine?

36:07.948 --> 36:10.168
You know good and well

36:10.211 --> 36:12.822
this family has everything
riding on that wine.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.607
Why would you tell
our biggest rival?

36:14.650 --> 36:16.217
- Because I was mad at you!

36:16.261 --> 36:19.699
And I wanted you
to pay for firing me!

36:31.145 --> 36:34.366
- Save our family the daily
embarrassment in the press.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.282
Accept reality.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.459
Plead guilty.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.295
[sighing]

36:51.426 --> 36:54.212
- FYI, I cut Kelvin loose

36:54.255 --> 36:57.258
and I'm gonna find a lawyer
that actually sees me.

36:57.302 --> 37:00.522
So you can go back to being
his little side piece.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.177
[rhythmic music]

37:04.744 --> 37:06.746
[door closing]

37:18.540 --> 37:20.673
[screaming]

37:21.543 --> 37:23.806
- August, thanks
for letting me stop by.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.330
I mean, you were right.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.070
I should've tried harder
to let you know

37:27.114 --> 37:28.376
that I was representing
Bridgette.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.292
And I'm sorry.
- No, no. I understand.

37:31.336 --> 37:34.730
You were just trying to do
what you thought was right.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.256
- All the good it did,
since Bridgette fired me.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.431
- Mm-hmm.

37:40.127 --> 37:42.738
- But you gotta
trust me sometimes.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.523
- I'm working on it.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.090
I don't want to lose you.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.267
- I don't want
to lose you either.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.748
- I'm still hoping
we have a future together

37:52.792 --> 37:54.272
after you get divorced.

37:56.491 --> 38:00.843
Should I show you how much
I accept your apology?

38:00.887 --> 38:02.715
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.325
I don't think this is right.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.196
I want more.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.025
How would do you feel
about meeting Simon?

38:09.983 --> 38:11.376
My son.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.467
- I think that would be amazing.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.470
- Good.

38:19.558 --> 38:20.994
[chuckling]

38:21.037 --> 38:24.998
Now you wanna finish
what you were about to do?

38:25.041 --> 38:26.434
- Huh?
- Yeah.

38:26.478 --> 38:27.522
- Yeah?

38:27.566 --> 38:29.089
[chuckling]

38:30.046 --> 38:33.006
[rhythmic music]

39:07.693 --> 39:08.824
- Stop.
[laughing]

39:08.868 --> 39:11.087
[cellphone vibrating]
- Oh.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.179
- Hello?
- I'm rehiring you.

39:16.223 --> 39:18.921
- Okay...
Uh, smart move, Bridgette.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.619
What changed your mind?

39:20.662 --> 39:22.838
- I thought long and hard about
my father and what he'd do.

39:22.882 --> 39:26.494
Reginald King would fight
this case until the end.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.714
If he were alive,
he would tell me to fight

39:28.757 --> 39:31.064
for my good name, his good name.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.414
So we're gonna
take this case to trial,

39:33.458 --> 39:36.330
and I know that we might
not win, but that's okay.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.854
Because I am not
the extortionist.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.422
So you can give a message
to my little sister.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.294
That I am more
like our dad than she is,

39:44.338 --> 39:48.081
because I'm not a traitor.
I'm a fighter.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.000
- Uh... Hey.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.697
I've gotta go.
- Where are you going?

39:55.741 --> 39:57.395
- I gotta go prep my case.

39:58.352 --> 40:01.529
Alright?
- Wait. What's going on?

40:01.573 --> 40:02.704
Was that Bridgette?

40:02.748 --> 40:05.272
Kelvin, I thought
we just worked this out.

40:05.315 --> 40:08.623
- August, please, I have
a legal obligation to Bridgette.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.059
Okay?
- Okay.

40:10.103 --> 40:13.106
- Alright. Let's talk
again in the morning.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.673
[door opening]

40:14.716 --> 40:16.283
What are you doing here?
- Kelvin, move.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.154
- What the hell are you
doing in my house?

40:18.198 --> 40:20.156
- I thought it was you two
I saw running together

40:20.200 --> 40:22.420
the other day,
looking quite smitten.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.248
- Sonya, how do you know
where I live?

40:25.292 --> 40:27.468
- August, I got this.
- What? Okay. Get her, then.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.122
- Last time I checked,
we're still married.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.471
Are you screwing her

40:30.515 --> 40:32.473
before the ink is dry
on our divorce?

40:32.517 --> 40:34.432
Because that would
change everything.

40:34.475 --> 40:37.130
- It is not what it looks like.
Let's discuss this outside.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.480
- Kelvin, what are you
talking about?

40:40.002 --> 40:42.135
Are you leaving with her?

40:44.572 --> 40:46.182
[sighing]

40:47.140 --> 40:48.446
[door closing]

40:49.055 --> 40:51.187
- She's the mother of my child.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.102
- Uh-huh.
- Please...

40:53.146 --> 40:55.017
You gotta trust me, remember?

40:55.061 --> 40:57.846
- Okay. Go.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.587
She's waiting.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.938
- August, we are still good.

41:02.982 --> 41:05.637
- Hmm.
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.600
[door closing]

41:22.654 --> 41:24.482
[tense music]

41:33.491 --> 41:35.667
- I want us to continue
as planned.

41:35.710 --> 41:39.148
- Look, shouldn't we wait
until your case plays out?

41:39.192 --> 41:40.933
- I don't have
that kind of time.

41:40.976 --> 41:42.238
- I don't know
what to tell you.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.414
I can't touch you, Bridgette.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.808
Everybody knows your name
and they're watching you.

41:46.852 --> 41:48.636
- Wait! Where are you going?

41:48.680 --> 41:50.769
You can't leave!

41:50.812 --> 41:52.988
What am I going to do?

41:54.076 --> 41:56.383
I can't do this alone!

41:57.384 --> 41:59.517
What am I going to do?

42:00.082 --> 42:01.867
Stop!

42:01.910 --> 42:04.260
[hip-hop music]
