00:31.440 --> 00:32.441
Hi.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.322
Sorry, the lights... hold on.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.319
Okay.
That's better.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.719
Hi.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.599
So I'll have copies of the zine

00:48.600 --> 00:49.965
after the reading.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.721
If you want to buy one, it's $8.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.696
But, like, if you don't think
it's worth $8,

00:55.720 --> 00:57.320
I'll probably just
give you one for free.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.119
I wrote this about the summer

01:02.120 --> 01:06.489
I sold weed through
an online classifieds site.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.359
Oh, but I hate weed, though.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.886
It makes me, like,
very uncomfortable and paranoid

01:12.000 --> 01:16.119
and sort of fatalistic, I guess,

01:16.120 --> 01:17.759
but every once in a while,

01:17.760 --> 01:19.096
you know, someone
will get me to smoke,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.009
and every time they do,
I think, like,

01:21.120 --> 01:22.485
"Oh, this is the time
I'm gonna like smoking weed."

01:22.486 --> 01:23.639
But then I do,

01:23.640 --> 01:25.244
and I don't like it at all.

01:25.245 --> 01:28.639
It's the worst always.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.005
But I just couldn't remember

01:30.120 --> 01:31.406
if I put that fact
into the story,

01:31.407 --> 01:33.119
so I wanted to,

01:33.120 --> 01:36.522
you know, tell you now
up front, I guess.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.519
Okay, I'm wasting time,

01:38.520 --> 01:41.519
so I'm gonna start reading now.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.646
Here it goes.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.402
Last summer, I was working
for a consultant in Midtown

01:51.403 --> 01:53.401
mostly filling out
organizational charts

01:53.402 --> 01:55.050
and filing things and stuff.

01:55.051 --> 01:58.279
It was an objectively
crappy job,

01:58.280 --> 01:59.930
but my parents
were really proud of me

02:00.040 --> 02:02.691
because I had gotten a job.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.685
I was listening
to Toro y Moi a lot,

02:04.686 --> 02:07.047
and he has that line
where he says, "I got a job...

02:07.160 --> 02:08.685
...I do it fine.
Not what I want,...

02:08.686 --> 02:10.279
but still I try."

02:10.280 --> 02:13.159
That totally captured
how I felt.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.447
On the weekends, me and
friends mostly went biking

02:15.448 --> 02:19.039
and took hallucinogens
and benzodiazepines.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.319
We also went to some parties,

02:21.320 --> 02:26.199
and one night, I met a girl
at one of those parties.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.559
Meeting girls isn't easy for me

02:28.560 --> 02:30.324
unless they come up to me,

02:30.440 --> 02:33.569
in which case I have no choice
but to meet them,

02:33.680 --> 02:35.842
and that was how I met Kate.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.079
Eliza!

03:00.080 --> 03:01.844
Hey.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.724
I have something for you.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.841
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:04.842 --> 03:07.719
What is it?

03:07.720 --> 03:09.365
It's a weird muscle relaxant.

03:09.366 --> 03:11.124
I got it at the airport
in Mexico.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.239
Are you happy?

03:12.240 --> 03:13.479
Very.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.719
Thanks.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.722
Ooh, it tastes good.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.163
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.639
What makes you qualified
to change the playlist?

04:01.640 --> 04:04.525
What kind of qualifications
did the last guy have?

04:04.526 --> 04:06.045
This really isn't
about the last guy,

04:06.160 --> 04:07.400
and who says it was a guy?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.282
Okay, well...

04:16.160 --> 04:17.685
I write a music blog,

04:17.800 --> 04:21.440
published on
a popular music reviews website.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.080
I can send you my resume
if you prefer.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.439
It lists all of
my tangible qualifications.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.010
Maybe if you give me
your email address

04:28.040 --> 04:30.441
or, you know, your phone number.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.561
Whatever works for you re:
contact information

04:32.562 --> 04:34.801
is fine for me... just,
you know, that I'd have it.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.799
So do you want to dance?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.839
Oh, yeah, no.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.199
I don't really dance, per se.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.319
Like, you can't
or, like, you won't?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.176
I never know how into it
I'm supposed to get, you know,

04:47.200 --> 04:48.845
and sometimes I get too into it,

04:48.846 --> 04:51.725
and then I end up making
that intense dance face

04:51.726 --> 04:53.721
where I sort of,
like, bite my lip,

04:53.722 --> 04:55.605
and I... you know, just like...

04:55.606 --> 04:57.728
You know, I'm sort of, like,
angry Bill Clinton.

04:57.729 --> 04:59.479
It's not good.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.936
And then the other option
is that, you know,

05:00.960 --> 05:02.839
I'm not into it enough,
and I hold back.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.808
Then I think everyone
around is probably thinking,

05:04.840 --> 05:07.056
like, "Oh, that kid thinks he's
too cool to dance," you know?

05:07.080 --> 05:09.731
I'm pretty sure no one
would ever think that about you.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.719
Okay, well, thank you.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.007
I think that probably means
it's about time

05:14.008 --> 05:15.719
for me to stop talking,

05:15.720 --> 05:17.599
because I've said enough...

05:17.600 --> 05:19.239
No, you were doing fine.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.879
- Wow.
- Adequate even.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.999
Oh, my God.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.239
But I actually
really like this song, so,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.368
like, are you ready to dance?

05:28.480 --> 05:30.482
- Oh...
- Let's do it.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.400
Okay.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.160
Okay.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.165
I can't do this.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.279
Okay.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.807
Yeah, no, there was a certain
too-good-to-be-true element

06:14.808 --> 06:17.804
about this whole thing anyway.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.159
Why can't you?

06:20.160 --> 06:22.279
- I have a boyfriend.
- Okay.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.930
But honestly I swear to God,

06:24.040 --> 06:25.929
it did not feel
like cheating until,

06:25.930 --> 06:27.559
like, just a moment ago.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.688
Like, I think
when you touched my boob,

06:29.800 --> 06:32.563
that's sort of when
I sort of drew the line.

06:32.564 --> 06:34.562
- Sure, sure.
- He doesn't live here.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.091
He goes to school in Virginia,

06:36.200 --> 06:39.199
so we have sort
of unconventional rules

06:39.200 --> 06:41.079
to sort of deal with that.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.079
Mm-hmm, and your
unconventional rules

06:45.080 --> 06:46.839
include a boob clause.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.683
Yes, yes.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.319
Good, good.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.560
I guess that's... yeah.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.439
Now, I'm just
spit-balling here.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.959
Okay.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.959
But do you want to just
fool around with me

07:01.960 --> 07:04.959
now and then, like,
marry him after

07:04.960 --> 07:06.199
college or something?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.359
No, not...

07:07.360 --> 07:08.725
Okay, I didn't think so,

07:08.840 --> 07:12.359
but I thought
I would offer it anyway.

07:12.360 --> 07:16.729
All right, well, in that case,

07:16.840 --> 07:20.839
should I call you
a cab or something?

07:20.840 --> 07:23.605
Well, can I sleep here?

07:23.720 --> 07:26.485
Oh.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.884
Would we have to sleep
head to toe or something?

07:28.885 --> 07:32.005
Not unless you really
wanted to, and we could,

07:32.006 --> 07:34.001
but I don't see why we have to.

07:34.002 --> 07:35.650
- Great.
- It's not in the rule book.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.884
Oh, it's not.
There's not a section for...

07:37.885 --> 07:39.882
No, as long
as you don't, like...

07:39.883 --> 07:42.119
with your hands on my boobs.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.121
We can sleep
however we want as long

07:44.122 --> 07:45.770
as I'm not touching
your breasts.

07:45.771 --> 07:48.001
Great, that sounds good.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.765
I'm gonna go brush my teeth

07:49.766 --> 07:53.003
and take some sort
of uncomfortably cold shower.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.079
Let's do this, classic song.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.081
Here we go.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.696
Mike brought me to a party
that I don't think

09:18.720 --> 09:20.609
I don't want to be at anymore,

09:20.720 --> 09:23.610
so I was wondering
if you'd want to come over.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.359
We could listen to music,
or we could just, you know,

09:27.360 --> 09:30.489
like, talk to each other
or something.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.131
Okay, um, that sounds great.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.241
Okay, awesome.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.359
See you later.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
Bye.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.006
Awesome.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.040
Hi, ma.

10:38.160 --> 10:43.166
David, so tell your mama.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.209
Are you dating?
Seeing any girls?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.687
- Ma, please.
- Adult to adult.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.776
You know I feel weird talking
to you about that kind of stuff.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.120
Could we just
talk about it later?

10:51.200 --> 10:52.439
- Later.
- Yeah, you know.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.442
Like later in our lives later.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.319
Everything's fine, re:
girls and me,

10:57.320 --> 10:58.959
but I just, you know,

10:58.960 --> 11:01.201
I feel weird talking
about it with you, so...

11:01.202 --> 11:03.965
That's what you always say
to me: â€œEverything fine, mommy.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.439
Not now, later."

11:05.440 --> 11:08.599
So I say to myself,
"Don't lose hope.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.203
Your boy is going to grow up
and become an adult."

11:11.204 --> 11:12.725
But I also think I'm not,

11:12.840 --> 11:15.199
like, exactly
an adult yet in that,

11:15.200 --> 11:16.959
you know, I'm only 22,

11:16.960 --> 11:19.606
so I feel like I have
some time to get there.

11:19.607 --> 11:20.965
When your father was 22,

11:20.966 --> 11:23.359
he was already done
with the Army.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.850
He was already a man.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.359
And I say...

11:31.360 --> 11:33.119
this is really good.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.885
Oh, that's good.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.079
Are you sure her actually
living with us is,

12:53.080 --> 12:55.560
like, such a smart idea?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.569
You mean, like,
for the relationship or, like,

12:57.680 --> 12:59.839
for my creature comforts?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.959
Relationship.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.201
Honestly it's not ideal,
but I think the alternative,

13:04.202 --> 13:06.199
which is her living upstate

13:06.200 --> 13:08.680
and commuting is maybe worse
for the relationship, you know?

13:08.720 --> 13:12.327
Like, right now, we're just in
that new relationship sweet spot

13:12.440 --> 13:14.090
where we don't secretly
loathe each other yet,

13:14.091 --> 13:16.199
so I think it could
be fun for us.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.328
But I don't want it to be
annoying for you, you know?

13:18.480 --> 13:19.845
- Yeah.
- Can I speak candidly?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.485
Do you have to?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.204
I feel like I know
what you're gonna say.

13:23.205 --> 13:24.725
You're gonna say
you don't like it...

13:24.726 --> 13:26.609
I don't like it,
because you barely know her,

13:26.720 --> 13:28.056
and if she starts acting weird,
you have nowhere to go.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.680
And why does she have
to move in so soon?

13:29.720 --> 13:30.721
Whoa, nobody said move in.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.563
She's not moving in.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.965
She's staying here.
It's a totally different thing.

13:33.966 --> 13:35.839
Semantics, David, okay?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.729
After what, after seeing
each other for, like, a month?

13:37.730 --> 13:39.245
What, is she
the hipster grifter?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.124
The... really?
The hipster grifter?

13:41.240 --> 13:43.364
Dude, you've met her.
You know she's totally normal.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.883
And also she's crazy hot,

13:44.884 --> 13:46.365
and she wants to stay
in my room,

13:46.366 --> 13:47.766
which defies all logic.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.479
So basically there's nothing

13:49.480 --> 13:51.005
you can say short
of proving she's some sort

13:51.006 --> 13:53.364
of neo-Nazi fembot
that would, you know,

13:53.365 --> 13:56.006
make me think this wasn't
a good idea, you know,

13:56.007 --> 13:58.241
and even then, I'd probably
still go through with it.

13:58.242 --> 13:59.765
Can I show her the mule?

13:59.766 --> 14:01.879
Yeah, sure, from time to time.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.282
- Really?
- No, go fuck yourself.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.519
David, can I speak to you?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.409
Sure.
What's up?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.879
In the conference room.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.769
Sure.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.811
You know you're not
the only one, right?

14:27.920 --> 14:30.799
Yeah, I guess.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.040
You have your company phone?

14:36.040 --> 14:37.565
Slide it down, please.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.042
Do I get some sort of severance?

14:51.043 --> 14:54.199
You'll have to talk
to HR about that.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.090
And when do I need to,
like, be out by?

14:57.200 --> 15:00.799
You clear out your desk
by the end of today.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.679
Oh, and could you just
tell the front desk

15:03.680 --> 15:06.445
that if my morn calls
to just, you know,

15:06.560 --> 15:10.201
tell her that I stepped out
to lunch or something?

15:10.320 --> 15:11.439
Just for today?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.204
No, I mean, probably for,

15:13.320 --> 15:16.839
like, six months or so
until I get a new job.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.208
I can email you to let
you know when I do.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.759
Have you seen the news?

16:27.760 --> 16:30.519
Everything's crashed, no good.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.522
You are lucky
to have job, David.

16:32.523 --> 16:33.931
Yeah, no good.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.760
What did you want to do
when you were a kid?

16:37.800 --> 16:39.679
To be in America only.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.406
But, like, what did you want
to do when you got here?

16:42.407 --> 16:43.925
I didn't think like this.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.168
I think to be in America,
you do anything:

16:46.169 --> 16:49.279
airline pilot,
accounting, doctor,

16:49.280 --> 16:51.567
big company CEO,

16:51.680 --> 16:54.679
ball-base player,
cowboy.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.199
David, when Tata

16:56.200 --> 16:58.043
was a young boy, dedushka used

16:58.044 --> 17:01.919
to play all the American
Western TV programs for him, eh?

17:01.920 --> 17:05.679
I thought everyone
in America is cowboy, bandits,

17:05.680 --> 17:09.570
Indians, sheriffs, deputies.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.682
Did you ever want to be
a bandit?

17:11.683 --> 17:13.204
Of course.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.527
The only one above the sheriff
is the bandits.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.961
For most of the story.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.329
David, eat.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.599
I'm sure
you'll find something else.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.364
Yeah, thanks.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.643
Do you know what you want
to do, like, with your life?

18:01.760 --> 18:02.761
I like sports.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.370
I can do something in sports.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.639
Are you joking?
I can't tell.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.999
Yeah, it's a "Seinfeld" thing.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.411
I don't actually like sports,

18:11.412 --> 18:14.006
I guess except tennis
and cycling,

18:14.120 --> 18:16.646
but there's too much drugs
in cycling.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.525
Well, I'm sure
you'll think of something.

18:25.526 --> 18:26.646
We'll see.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.159
Awesome, thank you.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.764
I got to go.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.406
Thanks, dude.

18:40.160 --> 18:44.051
Bye.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.806
Eliza!

19:37.480 --> 19:38.641
What's going on?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.967
Okay, I've got everything
I need. Can we meet this guy?

19:41.080 --> 19:43.239
- No.
- Just text me the info.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.959
Bye.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.849
Why do you have
to sell weed, though?

19:46.850 --> 19:50.239
Dealing just seems exciting
and glamorous

19:50.240 --> 19:52.481
and, like, potentially
extremely lucrative.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.728
I'll hopefully make
enough money to live on,

19:54.729 --> 19:58.884
and I'll get to, like,
live... capital L...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.606
in a way I haven't before.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.001
Plus, I'll have stuff
to write about,

20:04.002 --> 20:06.241
which would be cool
in that I want to be a writer.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.885
It's honestly kind of perfect,
right?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.519
I don't know.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.800
But, like,
here's the main thing:

20:13.880 --> 20:15.644
my chances
of getting caught are,

20:15.645 --> 20:17.639
like, relatively slim, right,

20:17.640 --> 20:19.130
which, you know,
is maybe fucked up,

20:20.760 --> 20:21.999
- It's totally true.
- I mean, like...

20:22.000 --> 20:23.999
And I hate smoking weed,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.764
so it's not like I'll smoke
all my product or something.

20:25.765 --> 20:26.999
- Oh, boy.
- And you will be

20:27.000 --> 20:28.759
on a very specific ration,

20:28.760 --> 20:31.650
so you also will not smoke
all of my product.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.926
Seriously though,
anything I would want to get

20:35.927 --> 20:39.159
is, like,
totally impossible right now.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.639
I don't believe that
for two seconds.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.290
Well, if you play
your cards right

20:43.400 --> 20:46.290
and earn it, maybe
you'll get a discount.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.776
- I know how to earn it.
- Oh, yeah?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.689
I know exactly how to earn it.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.680
They're here.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.446
Hi, David Shapiro.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.688
David.
Hey, how's it going?

21:32.720 --> 21:36.850
So, like, are you guys
pretty busy today with deals?

21:36.960 --> 21:38.959
What do you need?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.839
How much is an ounce?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.719
370.

21:42.720 --> 21:47.726
Okay, then I guess let me get...

21:49.240 --> 21:51.119
2 ounces.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.719
Is there a bulk discount?

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
Two isn't bulk, B.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.879
(speaking in Spanish)

22:01.880 --> 22:02.881
Si.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.771
(speaking in Spanish)

22:25.880 --> 22:27.759
I wish I had, like, a button

22:27.760 --> 22:31.399
I could press to make
a tumbleweed roll by,

22:31.400 --> 22:35.041
you know, like in situations
where nothing else is happening.

22:35.042 --> 22:37.159
Oh, what was the strain called?

22:37.160 --> 22:41.279
- Green Kush.
- Green Kush, okay.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.044
Do you have any other strains?

22:43.045 --> 22:44.799
Not at the moment.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.802
Is there a time of year
that weed is in season

22:46.920 --> 22:49.799
and it costs less?

22:49.800 --> 22:51.404
Is this kid for real?

22:51.520 --> 22:53.519
You know, when you buy
different vegetables

22:53.520 --> 22:55.256
at different times of the year,
they cost different amounts

22:55.280 --> 22:58.919
because they go in and out
of season, you know?

22:58.920 --> 23:02.159
Bruto, weed isn't a vegetable.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.319
Doesn't work that way.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.322
(both speak Spanish)

23:14.920 --> 23:19.926
David, I'd like
to explain something to you.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.799
And it's not because I like you

23:22.800 --> 23:25.559
or because I think you're cute,

23:25.560 --> 23:27.324
but solely because
the more customers

23:27.440 --> 23:31.079
that buy from me,
the better it is for me.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.839
But I got this feeling

23:32.840 --> 23:35.844
that you're not gonna
be my customer for that long,

23:35.845 --> 23:38.839
so I need you to listen.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.207
You need to shut the fuck up.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.719
You need to keep your mouth
closed and shut the fuck up.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.456
I know that you're gonna
be selling to people,

23:46.480 --> 23:48.839
and you're gonna just
be telling your life story,

23:48.840 --> 23:50.490
but you need to cut
that shit out right now,

23:50.491 --> 23:52.359
or you're gonna get popped.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.056
And stop smiling like you're
in a motherfucking day care,

23:54.080 --> 23:55.605
or I'll rob you.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.816
The only reason I'm not
robbing you right now

23:56.840 --> 23:58.479
is because of her,

23:58.480 --> 23:59.816
and I'll probably make more
off of you in the long run

23:59.840 --> 24:02.359
than I can take off
you right now.

24:02.360 --> 24:05.362
Don't tell anyone more
than they need to know.

24:05.363 --> 24:07.567
Don't tell anybody shit
about your personal life.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.886
You want to talk?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.002
Talk about the weather or movies

24:11.120 --> 24:12.759
or some bullshit.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.127
Don't pick up that phone
if you don't have to.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.763
Don't text if you don't have to.

24:16.764 --> 24:18.762
Keep all your conversations
to a minimum.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.641
Stay paranoid, B,
and keep it moving.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.879
You understand me?

24:28.880 --> 24:31.531
Yeah?

24:31.640 --> 24:34.279
Good.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.999
You call me when you need,
all right?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.764
You too, sweetheart.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.520
They seem nice.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.159
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.050
How much would that scale be?

25:17.200 --> 25:20.079
That is 40, but for you, 35.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.923
Oh, wow, that's so nice.
Thank you.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.079
Yeah, I'll take that, please.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.445
Anything else?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.684
Could I also get some
of those baggies, please?

25:30.685 --> 25:32.444
You got a lot of jewelry, right?

25:35.840 --> 25:37.319
Why do you think that?

25:37.320 --> 25:40.959
That is what you put
in the baggies, right?

25:40.960 --> 25:42.199
- Oh.
- Jewelry, yeah.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.201
Jewelry, yeah, no, yeah, for...

25:44.202 --> 25:46.407
that's why I need
the baggies, is for my jewelry.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.079
Right, for jewelry.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.048
Yeah, also the scale
is for weighing jewelry.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.367
It's all jewelry purchases.

25:52.480 --> 25:56.719
- Total, $40.
- Okay.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.079
Thank you.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.959
- Thank you.
- Good luck, huh?

26:00.960 --> 26:04.601
Thanks, with my jewelry.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.848
Okay.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.599
Oh, God, sorry.
Sorry.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.040
- It's all right.
- Okay, sorry, bye.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.885
Thank you.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.519
Hey, this is David Shapiro.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.761
I lost my job,
so I sell weed now.

26:38.762 --> 26:39.999
This is my weed number.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.001
Text me if you need, please.

26:41.002 --> 26:42.759
I deliver.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.047
Also feel free
to pass this number around.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.527
How am I gonna sell all this?

26:57.640 --> 26:59.290
I texted everyone
I know who smokes,

26:59.400 --> 27:02.799
like, two hours ago,
and I got one response.

27:02.800 --> 27:07.039
I feel like that might not
add up to a full-time job.

27:07.040 --> 27:11.159
Could you just not sell it
and then say that you did?

27:11.160 --> 27:14.050
I don't think that
would be super profitable,

27:14.051 --> 27:17.159
but it's a good idea.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.050
You know, I was actually
thinking about this,

27:20.200 --> 27:22.328
and do you realize that

27:22.440 --> 27:24.679
if you get caught selling weed,

27:24.680 --> 27:26.808
it doesn't matter
where you went to college

27:26.920 --> 27:29.439
or how cute you are?

27:29.440 --> 27:33.079
Because nobody
who pays over minimum wage

27:33.080 --> 27:36.641
is ever going to hire you ever.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.205
I just really want
the best for you.

27:38.206 --> 27:41.204
I mean, I really care about you.

27:41.320 --> 27:46.201
I know that sounds
really corny, but I do.

27:46.320 --> 27:49.085
Do you want to see something?

27:49.200 --> 27:50.319
Yeah.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.721
Okay, hand me my laptop.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.491
- Oh, on your laptop.
- Yes, on my laptop.

27:55.492 --> 27:57.599
What more do you want to see?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.359
- I don't know.
- You're gonna like it.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.966
- Promise.
- All right, laptop.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.359
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Uh-oh.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.119
Okay, get ready.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.360
Ta-da.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.130
What is this?

28:12.240 --> 28:14.096
This is a replacement
for that ugly, hideous couch

28:14.120 --> 28:15.121
in your living room.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.129
Whoa, pump the brakes.

28:17.240 --> 28:20.130
You just moved in here,
like, 45 seconds ago,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.241
and you're already redecorating.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.368
Yo, this my bach pad, B.
It's not our starter home.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.479
Oh, give me a break.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.369
I just thought it might, like,

28:28.480 --> 28:31.999
make the room
less hideous, you know?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.336
And it'll make
it more comfortable,

28:33.360 --> 28:36.119
and it's, like,
a perfect replacement

28:36.120 --> 28:38.883
because it probably
doesn't smell as bad.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.121
And that's a huge problem
that I'm having with the one

28:41.280 --> 28:44.119
that you have now.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.408
What are you doing?

28:47.520 --> 28:49.284
Are you trying to,
like, figure out a way

28:49.400 --> 28:51.759
to sell weed on the Internet?

28:51.760 --> 28:53.519
No, I'm just trying something.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.856
I probably won't even
go through with it.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.519
This is completely
fucking insane.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.285
Please do not use your one phone
call from jail on me.

29:00.286 --> 29:02.169
I am not going to help you.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.239
Hey.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.239
- Are... are you MJ?
- Yeah.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.730
Okay, and you are a cop,

30:20.880 --> 30:22.336
because you have to tell me
if you're a cop.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.885
Please just tell me
if you're a cop.

30:23.886 --> 30:27.359
I'm definitely not a cop.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.479
- Promise?
- Yeah.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.005
But I might be a psychopath

30:32.120 --> 30:33.007
who wants to lure
into our apartment

30:33.120 --> 30:34.759
to murder you.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.216
Honestly that would be, like,
a huge relief to me

30:36.240 --> 30:39.528
versus you being a cop.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.639
Okay, where do we do this?

30:41.640 --> 30:44.639
My apartment's right there.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.642
And you're not gonna, like,
rob me or something, right?

30:46.643 --> 30:48.130
'Cause I don't have any
cash on me.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.088
It would be a total waste
of your time,

30:49.120 --> 30:50.759
so don't rob me, please.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.411
Maybe I should get one
of those stickers that says,

30:53.520 --> 30:55.409
"Carries less
than $30 cash," and,

30:55.410 --> 30:57.279
like, put it on my bike,

30:57.280 --> 30:58.496
you know, 'cause then people
would know not to rob me.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.921
It wouldn't be worthwhile.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.407
Yeah, no, this isn't
where I would take somebody

31:03.408 --> 31:06.165
and then rob them
or murder them.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.169
In a darkened staircase.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.686
That's 20.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.679
Have you ordered online
before or...

31:33.680 --> 31:35.330
No, I just did it 'cause
I just moved here

31:35.331 --> 31:36.924
and I don't know anybody.

31:36.925 --> 31:39.924
So do you have, like,
regular hours,

31:40.080 --> 31:41.805
or can you deliver whenever?

31:41.806 --> 31:43.768
I deliver whenever.
Just email me when you need.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.325
I'm gonna need, like,
every day, so

31:45.440 --> 31:46.441
maybe we should just
set up a time

31:46.442 --> 31:48.439
and do that.

31:48.440 --> 31:52.729
Okay, do you want
to say here every day at noon?

31:52.840 --> 31:54.080
Yeah, sounds good.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.725
Cool, I will see you
tomorrow then.

31:55.726 --> 31:59.327
See you tomorrow.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.210
I never knew sea horses
are hermaphrodites.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.361
Yeah, that's pretty incredible.

32:11.362 --> 32:14.359
- Yeah.
- I made my first sale.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.249
Bye.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.486
John, what's up, man?

32:17.487 --> 32:18.839
What's up?

32:18.840 --> 32:20.490
- 20.
- Whoa.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.359
Hey, mom, no,
I'm on my lunch break,

32:35.360 --> 32:37.010
but I just wanted to call
and tell you

32:37.120 --> 32:39.361
that work is going
much better than it was,

32:39.480 --> 32:42.529
and I don't want you to worry
about me not liking my job,

32:42.530 --> 32:44.249
because, you know, I do.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.165
Sorry.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.769
That's awesome.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.722
Breaking news,
the U.S. stock market

34:20.723 --> 34:24.121
witnessed one of its worst
trading days in history

34:24.123 --> 34:26.723
when the Dow dropped
nearly 20% today.

34:26.724 --> 34:28.719
- Hello?
- Panicked brokers are trying

34:28.719 --> 34:30.484
to encourage investors
to keep them selling,

34:30.600 --> 34:33.603
but it doesn't look
like it's doing much good.

34:33.719 --> 34:36.366
Let's go to our financial
expert James Douglas,

34:36.367 --> 34:39.603
who's live on Wall Street
and witnessing the chaos...

34:39.760 --> 34:42.239
What's up, dude?

34:42.239 --> 34:45.639
Hey, are you Jeff?

34:45.639 --> 34:46.527
You're Jeff.

34:46.639 --> 34:49.879
What did you need?

34:49.880 --> 34:50.880
Do you have eighth?

34:50.882 --> 34:52.005
Yeah.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.882
So it's, um, 80.

35:07.160 --> 35:08.639
Sweet apartment.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.531
Thanks, it was a birthday gift
from my father.

35:12.640 --> 35:18.409
My dad once got me a LSAT
prep book for my birthday.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.039
Hey, do you want to smoke?

35:21.040 --> 35:23.679
No, I actually have
some deliveries

35:23.680 --> 35:25.682
right now to do, but thanks,

35:25.800 --> 35:27.689
and maybe next time.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.449
You Green Jacket?

35:54.560 --> 35:57.959
We have to go for a ride.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.089
- How far are we going?
- Around the block.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.089
Do you think we could go
into a store or something?

36:03.090 --> 36:04.570
I was told to, you know, like,

36:04.720 --> 36:05.846
not get into cars
with strangers.

36:05.847 --> 36:08.081
Kid, don't waste
my fucking time.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.599
Can you roll me one?

36:20.600 --> 36:22.364
Yeah.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.479
No, thanks.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.599
No, thanks?

36:35.600 --> 36:38.599
It makes me uncomfortable.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.763
Get paranoid, very prone
to panic attacks, anxiety,

36:41.880 --> 36:42.880
et caetera.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.645
You don't seem like
a regular pot dealer.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.888
You're not really
a regular pot buyer.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.119
How'd you get into this?

37:00.120 --> 37:01.759
I want to be a writer,

37:01.760 --> 37:03.524
but that doesn't really
seem realistic,

37:03.640 --> 37:07.519
so I'm doing this until
something better occurs to me.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.759
Before this, I had
a conventional job,

37:08.760 --> 37:10.639
but I lost it.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.279
I know how you feel.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.645
The board of directors
at my firm

37:13.646 --> 37:16.769
is meeting... well...

37:16.920 --> 37:18.759
they're gonna remove me.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.399
You want to deal weed?

37:20.400 --> 37:21.925
I could put you in touch
with my supplier.

37:21.926 --> 37:25.399
No, thank you.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.811
Appreciate it.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.799
Is that your bike?

37:31.800 --> 37:33.376
I used to have an old Schwinn
when I was in college.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.801
That thing weighs, like,
half a fucking ton, right?

37:36.802 --> 37:38.801
It's heavy,
but I think maybe only,

37:38.802 --> 37:39.926
like, 30 or 40 pounds.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.446
Why don't you get yourself
something decent?

37:49.560 --> 37:50.799
Are you serious?

37:50.800 --> 37:53.079
I'm investing in your operation.

37:53.080 --> 37:57.449
When you're a kingpin,
you'll bring me some free bags.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.081
Good luck with the Board.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.089
Hey.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.199
Hi.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.359
- I got a new bike.
- Yeah, I can see that.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.599
- What do you think?
- It's nice.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.604
That's really nice.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.839
Cool.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.999
I got you something too.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.239
- I'm excited.
- I got you...

38:42.240 --> 38:43.999
Oh!

38:44.000 --> 38:46.128
The inedible candy
that you love so much.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.605
- I love it.
- Yeah?

38:47.606 --> 38:48.761
Thank you.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.365
I have a distinct recollection

38:50.366 --> 38:52.239
of you eating
that the night we met,

38:52.240 --> 38:53.651
and it was, like, really hard
for you to eat, so you kind

38:53.652 --> 38:55.369
of looked weird, which was weird

38:55.480 --> 38:57.369
because usually you're
so cool and casual.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.680
But that night, it was, like,

38:58.760 --> 39:00.762
the opposite
of smoking a cigarette.

39:00.763 --> 39:03.759
Thank you.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.800
That'll be gone in a week.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.769
Gross.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.639
Here, get on.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.616
- No, I can't get on.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure you can.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.961
No my skirt... it's, like,
not conducive for bike riding.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.287
It's really... I can't... look.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.528
- Okay, just...
- I can't.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.041
- Just side-saddle it.
- What do you mean?

39:20.042 --> 39:22.164
Just, like, sit here but,
like, face there.

39:22.165 --> 39:24.925
But how is it gonna work?
Am I gonna die?

39:24.926 --> 39:28.799
Just sit.
Do you trust me?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.279
Yeah, this is fun.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.408
- Yeah, what do you think?
- It's nice.

39:32.409 --> 39:33.919
My feet were hurting.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.126
Oh, good.
This is your chariot.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.683
Why is it so nice, though?

39:36.684 --> 39:38.405
Why'd you get
such an expensive one?

39:38.406 --> 39:40.687
Well, at the risk
of sounding tautological,

39:40.800 --> 39:43.279
I prefer to think of it
as my, like, investment

39:43.280 --> 39:44.406
in my business, you know?

39:44.440 --> 39:46.039
Okay.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.804
I'm gonna write it off
my drug dealer taxes.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.091
This place is cool.
You live here?

39:58.200 --> 40:00.799
Don't ask me personal shit.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.565
Oh, yeah, right, sorry.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.682
- My dad's the super.
- Oh, cool.

40:05.683 --> 40:08.968
So you want Blueberry Haze
or California Sunset?

40:09.080 --> 40:10.959
Same price?

40:10.960 --> 40:13.199
I'll take Blueberry Haze then.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.202
Does it have, like,
blueberry plant DNA,

40:15.320 --> 40:17.607
like, spliced
into it or something?

40:17.608 --> 40:20.444
No, B, the name's
are all bullshit.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.806
Wake up.
You should reconsider

40:21.840 --> 40:23.968
because the California Sunset's
from Cal...

40:25.200 --> 40:26.845
Yo, that seat is hot, man.

40:26.846 --> 40:28.729
You said got
some new tires on it?

40:28.730 --> 40:30.609
How you like them?

40:30.720 --> 40:32.456
Oh, yeah, no, they're nice.
They're gator skins.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.816
My old ones were starting
to get worn down

40:33.840 --> 40:35.479
and weren't gripping
the road right,

40:35.480 --> 40:37.242
and all it takes
is one accident, you know?

40:37.243 --> 40:39.322
So you got to be careful,
but I think I want to put

40:39.360 --> 40:40.723
a lighter crank set on it too.

40:40.724 --> 40:42.245
I think that's gonna
be my next move.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.725
You picked that up quick, man.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.604
Thanks.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.365
All right, I got to go, man.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.130
For real, though,

40:58.240 --> 40:59.520
how do you ride this thing, man?

40:59.640 --> 41:01.641
I mean, why?
No brakes, no helmet.

41:01.642 --> 41:03.369
You can't even control the shit.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.496
Oh, man, I can't imagine not
riding fixed gear anymore,

41:05.520 --> 41:07.648
and I control it as well
as I can control a regular bike

41:07.649 --> 41:09.239
with regular brakes.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.651
You know, all you do is,
like, stop your feet,

41:10.652 --> 41:12.399
and that's how you stop moving.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.256
It's kind of hard to imagine
if you hadn't ridden one before,

41:14.280 --> 41:16.521
but all it takes is a little bit
of practicing,

41:16.522 --> 41:18.284
like zooming around traffic,
like...

41:18.400 --> 41:21.285
You know, it's almost like
you're connected to the road,

41:21.286 --> 41:23.519
and, like, there's just
nothing like it, you know?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.016
I think honestly
for some people it can be,

41:25.040 --> 41:26.919
like, a spiritual thing,

41:26.920 --> 41:29.016
and obviously also there are
some mechanical advantages too,

41:29.040 --> 41:31.519
but that's not why
I ride it, you know?

41:31.520 --> 41:34.405
Damn, brah,
I didn't want a fucking sermon.

41:34.406 --> 41:36.164
Let me ride it.
Okay, you got it?

41:36.280 --> 41:39.679
Just peddle.
Yeah, I got it.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.799
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.559
Slow down, slow down.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.016
Just stop peddling,
stop... just stop peddling.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.166
No, keep...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:46.167 --> 41:49.559
You're fucking crazy, B.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.164
I don't know
how to stop this thing.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.810
It gets easier.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.447
Want no part of that shit.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.324
I've never seen your face
like that.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.089
- How are you?
- Good.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.559
What's up?

42:12.560 --> 42:16.849
Nothing; I have, like, 15
new customers or something,

42:16.960 --> 42:17.961
so it's kind of crazy.

42:17.962 --> 42:19.719
Oh, that's awesome.

42:19.720 --> 42:22.199
Yeah, I think
it's... | think it's awesome.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.611
- Yeah.
- I'll see you in a bit.

42:23.612 --> 42:25.329
Oh, you're leaving?

42:25.440 --> 42:27.090
Yeah, I got to go,
but I'll see you tonight, okay?

42:27.091 --> 42:29.199
- Okay.
- Bye.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.089
Oh, slow down, chief.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.040
You want winner?
My ice cream's, like, melting.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.056
No, seriously I can't.
I got deliveries, but thanks.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.120
Dude, you're a weed dealer,
not an ambulance driver.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.216
They're not gonna give a fuck
if you're 15 minutes late.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.605
I guess we'll never know.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.724
Wow.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.365
Did you know...

42:48.480 --> 42:50.130
- Yeah?
- That the restaurant

42:50.240 --> 42:55.119
Red Lobster invented
the dish shrimp scampi?

42:55.120 --> 42:56.483
- Really?
- Yeah, in, like,

42:56.484 --> 42:58.005
the 1970s, it didn't exist,

42:58.120 --> 43:00.122
and then they just invented it.

43:00.123 --> 43:02.122
- Okay, good one.
- Okay.

43:02.240 --> 43:07.119
Did you know that Taco Bell
invented the hard shell taco?

43:07.120 --> 43:10.522
- No, is that true?
- That is completely 100% true,

43:10.640 --> 43:15.646
and did you know
that Au Bon Pain invented bread?

43:16.400 --> 43:18.767
Wait, that one sounds
like it's probably not true.

43:18.768 --> 43:22.639
- It is true.
- The word "pain" does...

43:22.640 --> 43:24.285
My French is not so good.

43:24.286 --> 43:26.647
Well, lucky for you,
mine is excellent, so...

43:26.648 --> 43:28.159
D'accord.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.764
Do you even understand
what that means?

43:29.880 --> 43:31.644
- No, but it's very sexy.
- Thank you.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.256
You can continue
to speak French for me

43:33.280 --> 43:34.406
at any and all times.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.159
I speak a little French.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.376
We should go to Paris,
and I should try it out.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.289
Let's go right now.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.170
Surprise!

43:50.160 --> 43:52.039
Birthday!

43:52.040 --> 43:54.441
Thank you guys so much.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.559
Hey!

43:55.560 --> 43:56.799
My man.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.165
Happy birthday.

43:58.320 --> 44:00.163
What's up?
Totally fooled.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.199
- Hi, friends.
- Hi.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.202
I was so nervous I'd run
into one of you on the way in,

44:07.203 --> 44:09.328
but it worked out, so...

44:09.440 --> 44:10.679
It totally worked out.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.206
- I was nervous.
- It's amazing.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.971
I don't know how you guys...
I don't know how you did this.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.844
I did it.
I pulled it off.

44:17.960 --> 44:20.201
Thank you.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.321
The birthday boy.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.559
Happy birthday!

44:23.560 --> 44:25.210
Whoo!

44:34.480 --> 44:36.084
- Hey.
- Hey, this is amazing.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.089
Thank you so much.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.606
What's going on
with you, though?

44:39.607 --> 44:41.489
Are you okay?
You're, like, half dead.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.843
Oh, it's just I actually took
two of your clonazepams

44:44.960 --> 44:47.096
before we came, so I just need
to get some food in my stomach.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.839
I don't have any more
clonazepam.

44:48.840 --> 44:50.456
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, you do.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.482
I know it was
on the night stand.

44:52.483 --> 44:56.246
David, that was zolpidem.
Did you really take that?

44:56.360 --> 44:58.119
When you did start taking
a sleeping pill?

44:58.120 --> 44:59.976
When you started coming home
at 5:00 in the morning,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.762
waking me up, but honestly,

45:01.763 --> 45:04.124
what difference does it make
when I started taking it?

45:04.125 --> 45:07.886
Why would you take my pills
without asking me what they are?

45:08.000 --> 45:11.004
I don't know,
because I like them.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.002
- Yay!
- Speech, speech, speech!

45:28.160 --> 45:30.279
Speech, speech, speech!

45:30.280 --> 45:34.159
My excellent good friends,

45:34.160 --> 45:35.879
a thousand monkeys

45:35.880 --> 45:39.159
and a thousand typewriters
couldn't convey

45:39.160 --> 45:40.924
how I feel in this moment.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.290
Thank you, guys.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.927
We'll get the check separate.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.166
Separate bills.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.328
Thank you.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.559
Guys, I'm so sorry.

46:26.560 --> 46:29.211
He'll be here any...
oh, here he is.

46:29.320 --> 46:32.449
He's here.
Yeah, I'll keep an eye on the...

46:32.600 --> 46:34.728
Thank you.
Thank you for waiting.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.080
Hey.
I had to go to fucking Queens.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.202
Cool, I had to fight tooth
and nail to keep this court.

46:45.203 --> 46:46.723
I mean, look at that guy,
he's huge.

46:46.724 --> 46:48.722
And now we only have
30 minutes to play, so...

46:48.840 --> 46:50.725
- So let's get going.
- Great.

46:50.726 --> 46:52.484
Do you want to play a set
or just hit.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.250
Let's play a set.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.124
I don't need any warm up.
I was on the bike all day.

46:56.125 --> 46:58.361
Great, 'cause we don't have
time for you to warm up.

46:58.362 --> 47:00.362
- You want to serve?
- Yeah, ready?

47:00.363 --> 47:01.486
First ball in.

47:05.120 --> 47:08.359
Oh, sorry, little rusty.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.600
Here we go, you ready?

47:13.120 --> 47:14.479
Oh.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.519
Yeah, sorry.
That... yup.

47:16.520 --> 47:17.885
Okay, I get it.
I get it.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.365
I'm on your shit list right now.

47:19.366 --> 47:21.519
Can we please just, like, play?

47:21.520 --> 47:23.409
This is playing.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.522
Here we go.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.885
Hilarious.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.402
It's like I'm high or something.

47:35.403 --> 47:37.164
I don't know.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.410
As amazing
as playing tennis with you

47:46.520 --> 47:48.284
right now is,
I got to go on a run.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.519
Are you serious?

47:49.520 --> 47:51.279
Yeah, no, I'm really sorry,

47:51.280 --> 47:53.136
but I did make it clear
I might have to leave early.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.525
I mean,
we just starting playing.

47:54.526 --> 47:57.679
Did we... did we
not just start playing?

47:57.680 --> 48:00.411
Again, really sorry.
I know this sucks, but...

48:00.560 --> 48:02.050
Can't you just do it
after we finish?

48:02.051 --> 48:05.169
My customers use me
because I'm fast and reliable.

48:05.170 --> 48:06.919
I'm the best at this.

48:06.920 --> 48:10.925
If I start making exceptions,
my business is fucked.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.563
I'll make it up to you, okay?
We'll play another day.

48:13.564 --> 48:15.210
No, I don't think so, dude.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.924
Like, I don't think

48:17.080 --> 48:20.801
we can play tennis
or socialize or anything

48:20.920 --> 48:22.445
until you get a new job.

48:22.446 --> 48:24.807
What do you mean, Mike?

48:24.960 --> 48:26.849
I mean, I'm just over it, dude.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.961
Every time we hang out,
I have to worry

48:28.962 --> 48:31.439
that the DEA is gonna show up
with assault rifles

48:31.440 --> 48:32.441
and take us to prison.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.561
- The DEA.
- Yeah.

48:33.720 --> 48:35.210
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.731
I think you've been
watching too many movies.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.296
It's hard to imagine
there's anyone lower

48:38.320 --> 48:39.731
on the weed-dealing totem
pole than me.

48:39.732 --> 48:41.324
I sell, like,
tiny amounts of weed.

48:41.480 --> 48:42.811
Yeah, and you
sell a lot of them,

48:42.840 --> 48:45.207
like a lot
of teeny amounts of weed.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.607
Maybe they need some.
Why don't you go ask?

48:53.360 --> 48:54.962
You should seriously consider

48:54.963 --> 48:57.611
how this job is affecting
your relationships.

48:57.720 --> 49:00.121
I mean, have you even
talked to your girlfriend?

49:12.120 --> 49:14.600
I will be right back.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.559
Thanks.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.050
Want to smoke?

50:12.160 --> 50:13.536
I've got, like,
five other deliveries

50:13.560 --> 50:14.919
right now, but...

50:14.920 --> 50:17.919
You say that every day.
Is it me?

50:17.920 --> 50:20.571
I just don't think
it would be a good idea

50:20.572 --> 50:23.928
for me to come inside.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.080
Hi.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.959
What's up?

50:41.960 --> 50:44.440
I'm going to the Janie tonight.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.442
You want to come?

50:45.600 --> 50:47.170
The Janie, really?

50:47.200 --> 50:50.199
Like...
like, by yourself.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.839
No, with my roommate.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.968
Aren't I your roommate?

50:55.080 --> 50:59.961
Yeah, no, my roommate
from school.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.368
Are you sure you don't want
to stay here tonight?

51:03.480 --> 51:05.359
Um, and do what?

51:05.360 --> 51:06.976
We could watching
this streaming documentary

51:07.000 --> 51:08.843
that one of my customers
was telling me about,

51:08.844 --> 51:10.999
about how animals masturbate.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.001
Spoiler alert, whales masturbate

51:13.002 --> 51:14.729
by rubbing up against rocks.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.891
Okay.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.999
Can you zip me UP?

51:24.000 --> 51:25.604
Sorry.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.639
Yeah.

51:27.640 --> 51:32.639
Also, though, did you know
that rats have clitorises?

51:32.640 --> 51:36.999
No, I did not,
but, yeah, thank you.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.279
Okay, bye.

51:38.280 --> 51:41.999
Even castrated
horses masturbate.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.004
Orangutans actually
fashion dildos out of tree bark.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.522
I mean, you can't be
a part-time drug dealer.

51:58.523 --> 52:00.279
It's a full-time gig,

52:00.280 --> 52:02.376
and plus, I'm trying to find
inspiration for my story.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.687
I mean, I'm still planning
on writing a novel.

52:04.688 --> 52:06.921
I don't know, I don't know.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.041
It is what it is.

52:16.040 --> 52:19.408
Why do you chew up
your pills like that?

52:19.440 --> 52:22.683
Makes them work faster.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.451
I don't like my job either.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.679
Really?

52:26.680 --> 52:28.330
It seems like it could be fun.

52:28.440 --> 52:31.319
Writing about commercial
real estate?

52:31.320 --> 52:32.656
Yeah, no, I don't know.
I mean, it seems

52:32.680 --> 52:34.569
like it could be interesting,

52:34.570 --> 52:37.959
big deals, big egos, et cetera.

52:37.960 --> 52:41.199
Want to trade jobs?

52:41.200 --> 52:43.089
No way.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.409
But I think they might be
hiring other writers

52:50.600 --> 52:52.329
if you're interested.

52:52.480 --> 52:55.962
What, really?
Yeah, definitely.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.599
Do you have any
experience writing?

52:58.600 --> 53:01.604
I write a blog
about a music website.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.239
Would that count?

53:04.240 --> 53:07.130
Email me the link,
and I'll show it to my boss.

53:07.131 --> 53:08.360
Awesome.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.479
- I know what you're doing.
- What?

53:16.480 --> 53:19.245
What, do you think we don't
know what's going on here?

53:19.360 --> 53:21.361
Yeah, you're here
every couple of days greasy

53:21.362 --> 53:23.119
like you've been biking all day.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.856
- Yeah, no, I like to bike.
- Yeah, you like to bike.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.121
I know you like to bike.
Sometimes your eyes are red.

53:27.122 --> 53:28.884
Okay.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.519
And you look like you're
gonna shit your pants.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.521
Every time you leave,
the kid from 6.J,

53:34.522 --> 53:36.363
he comes down, too,
a half hour later.

53:36.364 --> 53:40.729
His eyes are red too,
only he's more chilled out.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.376
Yeah, no, look, I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.765
That kid's just my friend,

53:43.880 --> 53:45.376
and I come to say
what's up to him, so...

53:45.400 --> 53:47.528
Yeah, okay,
what's his last name?

53:47.529 --> 53:49.159
I don't know it.

53:49.160 --> 53:50.889
I mean, we just,
like, take class together.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.376
It's not, like, I, you know,
asked him already.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.526
I don't know
his life story, you know?

53:53.527 --> 53:58.039
Just relax.
Let me get some.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.806
Yeah, give me a little smoke.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.046
What?

54:10.680 --> 54:12.569
You scared the shit
out of me, dude.

54:12.680 --> 54:15.399
Sorry, I was only
fucking with you.

54:15.400 --> 54:16.925
Yeah, hilarious.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.804
How much do you need?
Let me get a G.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.445
It's 20.

54:29.920 --> 54:32.439
Let me get another one.

54:32.440 --> 54:33.805
Okay.

54:36.960 --> 54:38.319
Thanks.

54:38.320 --> 54:42.199
Yeah, oh,
it's another 20, though.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.851
Cops and security guards,
we're like this.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.088
Nice doing business with you.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.648
- What's up?
- What's up, bro?

55:32.649 --> 55:34.359
You all right?

55:34.360 --> 55:38.999
- Good, what's going on?
- Nothing, you ready?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.367
- Do it outside like this?
- No, it's in here.

55:41.368 --> 55:42.646
Oh.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.884
Said you wanted 3 ounces, right?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.399
Yeah, please.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.721
Cool.

55:52.760 --> 55:55.650
Here you go.

55:55.760 --> 55:57.524
Thanks.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.016
Is everything else good
with you, bro?

55:59.040 --> 56:01.041
Yeah, things are good.
How you doing?

56:01.042 --> 56:02.519
All right, man, you know.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.880
Just hanging in there,
so to speak.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.044
Put your hands behind your back,

56:05.045 --> 56:06.041
and get up against the wall!

56:06.042 --> 56:07.530
You're under arrest.

56:07.640 --> 56:09.016
You have the right
to remain silent.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.799
Anything you say or do
can be used...

56:10.800 --> 56:12.404
- Ace, what's happening?
- I don't know, David.

56:12.405 --> 56:15.039
I don't know.
Ace, Ace, Ace.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.804
Ace.

56:16.920 --> 56:20.163
- If you do not have a lawyer...
- Ace, what is this, man?

56:20.280 --> 56:22.282
Man, he's about to faint.

56:26.440 --> 56:29.559
You should see
your face right now.

56:29.560 --> 56:30.799
It's a joke, man.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.926
Lighten up.

56:34.920 --> 56:36.206
Oh, come on, David,

56:36.320 --> 56:39.927
we're just joking with you, man.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.445
I'll see you next week.

57:00.320 --> 57:01.321
What happened?

57:03.840 --> 57:07.481
I got robbed,
but only for, like,

57:07.600 --> 57:10.331
$20 by a doorman, so whatever.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.850
It's just, like,

57:11.960 --> 57:14.959
some kind of tax
or something, I guess,

57:14.960 --> 57:17.122
but then Ace
played a prank on me

57:17.240 --> 57:20.719
that really wasn't funny.

57:20.720 --> 57:22.605
I'm really sorry, David, but,

57:22.606 --> 57:25.001
like, you knew that stuff
like this was gonna happen.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.879
Okay, you're right.

57:30.880 --> 57:32.245
Okay.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.727
So I talked to Mike.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.999
I gathered.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.879
This job you have

57:39.880 --> 57:42.247
is making it impossible
to spend any time with you.

57:42.248 --> 57:45.119
You probably spend more time

57:45.120 --> 57:47.216
with your customers than you do
with your actual friends,

57:47.240 --> 57:49.129
and you act weird all the time

57:49.240 --> 57:52.519
because you are always
stoned or on pills.

57:52.520 --> 57:55.283
And you leave places
in the middle of hanging out,

57:55.284 --> 57:57.647
and everyone's really,
really worried about you

57:57.760 --> 57:59.519
because you sell weed

57:59.520 --> 58:01.440
in the most public way
possible: on the Internet.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.644
Well, I don't know
what else to do.

58:03.645 --> 58:05.881
You know, this is something
that I'm good at

58:06.040 --> 58:08.771
and makes me feel satisfied
with myself, you know?

58:08.920 --> 58:11.287
Even if there are
occasional hiccups.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.039
This whole entire
thing is a hiccup.

58:14.040 --> 58:16.281
We used to, like, spend time
together like normal people.

58:16.282 --> 58:18.282
Like, we would go out
and do things

58:18.283 --> 58:20.159
and do activities,

58:20.160 --> 58:22.049
and now I spend more time
with your roommate,

58:22.160 --> 58:24.561
sitting on that disgusting couch
in your living room,

58:24.680 --> 58:26.039
than I do with you.

58:26.040 --> 58:27.280
Come on, seriously, I mean,

58:27.440 --> 58:29.439
we have nice conversations,

58:29.440 --> 58:31.807
and you teach me things
all the time.

58:31.920 --> 58:32.921
When I first met you,

58:32.922 --> 58:36.559
I felt curious about you,

58:36.560 --> 58:39.799
and I felt connected
to you in a way

58:39.800 --> 58:43.079
that I haven't felt
with anybody else before.

58:43.080 --> 58:44.919
You have a lot of ideas,

58:44.920 --> 58:48.439
and some of them are great,

58:48.440 --> 58:51.683
like selling hummus
in squeeze bottles.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.961
- Great for sandwiches.
- It's brilliant!

58:53.962 --> 58:55.962
But, like, I don't
know what to do.

58:56.080 --> 58:57.730
Like, I can't do this anymore

58:57.731 --> 59:00.724
if you're not gonna
be here with me at all.

59:00.840 --> 59:01.966
Okay, okay.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.839
Can we make a deal?

59:07.840 --> 59:09.968
It depends what it is.

59:10.080 --> 59:13.084
I will try to be more here,

59:13.200 --> 59:15.965
like, way more here,

59:16.080 --> 59:20.079
if you can try to be more okay

59:20.080 --> 59:22.731
with what I'm doing
when I'm not here.

59:22.840 --> 59:24.968
I don't know.
I guess we could try it.

59:24.969 --> 59:27.088
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

59:27.120 --> 59:29.361
Now, do you want to hear
some good news

59:29.480 --> 59:32.719
about a possible thing
that might happen?

59:32.720 --> 59:35.610
One of my customers is gonna try
to set me up with a writing job.

59:37.880 --> 59:39.769
It's something.

59:49.120 --> 59:50.121
I'm sorry.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.129
What are you doing on Thursday
at 7:00?

59:54.130 --> 59:56.088
Whatever you want.
Why?

59:56.120 --> 59:57.963
I want you to take me to dinner.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.401
You've neglected me for,
like, over two months,

01:00:00.402 --> 01:00:02.767
and now you have
to make it up to me.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.167
Well, then
you'd better get ready,

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:09.165
'cause you're gonna
have, like, so much dinner,

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.725
like, more dinner than, like,

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.285
you're even gonna know
what to do with.

01:00:12.286 --> 01:00:15.159
I mean, it's gonna be,
like, 14 courses.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.639
There's gonna be amuse-bouches

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.530
and aperitifs and digestifs.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.407
All the "tifs" are gonna
be well-represented.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.409
Okay.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.919
And I really am sorry.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.809
Thank you.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.039
Hey, it's me.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.042
I just have one more stop
to make, and then I'll be there.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:48.566
So probably like 8:45.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.079
Hello.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.321
I have your delivery.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.965
Well, come on in.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.490
Let me see the shit.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.479
What's this one called?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.606
It's Candy Apple.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:28.251
Candy Apple, Candy Apple.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.239
I've smoked Swansea,

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.479
Blue Haze,

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.486
Jack Frost, Lowrider,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.119
Wonderberry, Misty,

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.600
Iceberry Blue, JFK.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:51.885
I even smoked Horse Shit
with my grandma.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.525
Don't do that.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.639
This any good?

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.642
Yeah, it's great.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.525
- It's 40 for the two.
- Is this a gram each?

01:02:02.526 --> 01:02:05.759
'Cause it looks like maybe
.8, .9.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.399
Yeah, no,
they're 20s, not grams.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.519
We're not in Europe, dude.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.171
We're not in Europe.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.886
- God bless America.
- Let's get fucked up.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.519
I have somewhere to be,
actually, so enjoy.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.161
Oh, oh, got some girls coming.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.169
Yeah, I should probably just...

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:32.799
Well, I got these.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.805
- What are those?
- I don't know.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.364
Fuck.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.931
Fuck.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.530
Do you have the two eighths?

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.976
Have you heard anything
about the job yet?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.320
Yeah, I don't think
it looks good.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.736
They just hired
a couple of people.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.125
Did you show your boss my blog?

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.764
Yeah.
Yeah, it was great.

01:06:21.765 --> 01:06:25.879
It was really interesting stuff.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.167
He said it just wasn't, like,
the same thing that we do.

01:06:28.168 --> 01:06:30.049
I can do other stuff.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.762
It's not like the ability
to write about real estate

01:06:31.763 --> 01:06:33.285
is, like, an inborn
characteristic, you know?

01:06:33.286 --> 01:06:34.805
I mean, I could learn how to...

01:06:34.806 --> 01:06:37.690
- Do you have the plants?
- Of course.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.928
But do you see what
I'm saying about the...

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.161
Can I just have them?

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.164
Christmas!

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.919
- Thanks.
- Later.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.206
See you.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.690
(both speaking Spanish)

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.719
Oh, shit, a cop.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.327
Where you going?

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.599
Fuck!

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.485
Fuck, was you watching me, man?

01:07:29.486 --> 01:07:32.211
- You had me, huh?
- Fucking bullshit, man.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.606
Hey, man,
leave them boys alone, now.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.479
What you doing, man?

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.359
Them boys... hey!

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.249
Legalize it, pavilar!

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.719
Have you talked to her yet?

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.121
Yeah, I sent her some
texts and emails,

01:07:55.122 --> 01:07:56.724
including one
which I wrote entirely

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.599
from the perspective
of the "Mailer Demon," so...

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.759
Wait, what's the mailer demon?

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.362
You know that thing
that, you know,

01:08:04.363 --> 01:08:06.119
sends you an email
when you send an email

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.336
to an address
that doesn't exist.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.239
It bounces it back
to you, you know,

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.096
and then it says "Mailer Demon"
at the top in all caps.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.645
What?

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.519
I'm pretty sure
that's called Mailer-Daemon.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.408
Mailer-Daemon?

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.000
That's... I don't even
think that's a word.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.281
Wouldn't it be demon?

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.006
What's a daemon?
I don't know.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.890
I've never really actually
heard someone say Mailer-Daemon

01:08:27.892 --> 01:08:32.602
or mailer demon out loud,
so you might actually be right.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.158
So has she replied back
to your email or...

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.519
Oh, yeah, I'll show you.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.519
She sent me this sweet pic

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.522
of a middle finger made out of,

01:08:43.523 --> 01:08:46.126
like, backslashes and stuff.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.571
That's creative.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.015
She really spent a lot
of time on it,

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.644
and she's clearly
thinking about me,

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.682
so I feel like it's just
a matter of time now.

01:08:53.683 --> 01:08:54.805
Come on, we're good.

01:08:54.807 --> 01:08:56.689
Yeah, no, it's...

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.444
Hey, maybe... you know what?

01:08:58.446 --> 01:09:00.441
Maybe you should just
relax on her.

01:09:00.442 --> 01:09:03.203
Oh, come on, man,
look how happy these guys are.

01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:05.042
They're drinking the same stuff.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.645
I feel like we're all gonna
be all smiles pretty soon here.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.962
- Hey, what's...
- Did you turn Ace in?

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:20.441
He got arrested.

01:09:20.442 --> 01:09:22.198
What? Holy shit!

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.850
'Cause he thinks
you turned him in.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.200
Now he's looking for you.

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:26.719
What? Why?

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.210
'Cause he saw you, like,

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.198
a minute before he got arrested,

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.296
and then afterwards, he tried
to call you to ask about it,

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:32.443
and you didn't answer.

01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:34.090
Like, why didn't you answer?

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.198
I don't know.
I didn't see his call.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.816
I must've missed it.
What are you talking about?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.841
Wait, did you tell him
where I live?

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.604
I mean, I told him
the cross streets,

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.370
but I didn't tell him
your address.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.720
I didn't even know
why he was asking until, like,

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.807
after I already told him.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.599
Like, I'm sorry.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.599
Oh, fuck.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.999
Do you think he's gonna tell
the cops about me or something?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.729
I mean, I don't think
that's really his style.

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.007
Like, I don't think he would,
but you're,

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.359
like, a tiny fish
to them anyway, so...

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.761
What is his style?

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.484
Shit. Shit.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.399
Do you go to school?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.496
Don't ask me personal shit, man.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.165
You're a fucking drug dealer.

01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:36.003
Drug dealers don't talk
about personal shit.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.039
They talk about benign shit
or don't talk.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040
- Yeah, I just...
- Yeah.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.804
Were you just doing that
for free weed?

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:13.451
It's okay if you were.
Like, I won't be offended, but...

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.210
Fuck!

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.204
Fuck!

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.845
Shit!

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.207
God fucking... fuck!

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.490
Hey, yo, cuz, what up?

01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.999
Man, take it.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.241
Everything's in there.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.599
Ace, man, listen.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.762
Ace, man, I didn't say
anything to anyone.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.370
I swear, man.
Why would I do that?

01:12:16.371 --> 01:12:21.366
I wouldn't fucking...
Ace, man, please.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.880
Please.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.525
It's all right.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.890
Ugh!

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.759
Get the fuck out of here.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.046
You got something for me?

01:12:42.047 --> 01:12:45.039
Little bitch.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.042
Come and get some.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.039
What you got here?

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.639
Got a little treat for me?

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.927
Oh, jackpot, fellas.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.520
We're partying tonight.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.799
You don't remember
what I told you?

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.450
Stay paranoid, B!

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.610
Hey, mom.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.856
I just had a shitty day
at work, you know,

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.008
so I thought
I'd call and say hi.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.519
Um, one of our clients just
delayed paying his fee for,

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.999
like, months

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.001
and then just
declared bankruptcy,

01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:31.128
so my boss is just in
a really foul mood, you know?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.650
And Kate broke up with me.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.402
Like, a month ago.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.044
My girlfriend.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.524
Ma, I did.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.402
Ma, I've had a few girlfriends.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.319
Okay.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.685
Okay, good night, bye.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.442
I didn't even
know you were here.

01:15:40.443 --> 01:15:42.442
We're gonna order some Dominos.
You want?

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.087
Um, yeah, sure.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.849
What happened to you?

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.725
I don't... I don't want
to talk about it, please.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.726
Can I buy some hydrocodone
off of you, though, please?

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.079
You can have some.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.081
Here.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.479
Thanks.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.125
Do you think it was a mistake

01:16:08.126 --> 01:16:10.009
for me to let Kate
move in with us?

01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:12.839
I really enjoyed
having her here.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.491
She was very comforting.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.002
I think that if you add up
all of the waking moments

01:16:19.003 --> 01:16:21.119
in the last four months

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.361
of which you were not
making any mistakes,

01:16:23.362 --> 01:16:28.239
it would probably add up
to about six hours.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.130
So, like, what did I do
that wasn't a mistake?

01:16:31.131 --> 01:16:34.329
Kate... definitely
not a mistake, I think.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.244
She was so hot that I thought

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.643
she had to be mentally defective
to be sleeping with you.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.125
You're such a fucker.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.645
Or hiding a secret,

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.410
like maybe she murdered
her parents.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.521
I don't know.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.287
Why didn't you tell me
I was fucking up, man?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.050
There were way
too many other people

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.527
trying to tell you
that I didn't need to.

01:16:58.528 --> 01:17:01.410
Not that you listened.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.399
No.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.402
So what are you gonna do now?

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.681
And luckily Ace didn't kill me,

01:17:16.682 --> 01:17:19.570
and eventually he found the kid
who really did turn him in,

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.799
and he texted me, "Sorry, bro."

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.131
And I texted him back,
"It's okay.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.679
I forgive you."

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.199
I was not cut out
for that business,

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.568
but not everything
was totally destroyed.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.924
He looks like a deranged maniac.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.929
- I'll deal with it.
- Okay.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.159
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.571
What are you doing here?

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.679
What happened to your face?

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:30.325
Um, so you left these
at my apartment,

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.559
and I wanted you to have them.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.199
David, what the fuck?

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.328
What the fuck are you
doing at my house?

01:19:36.329 --> 01:19:40.086
Well, I came to see you.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.656
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.445
You would've said I couldn't.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.319
Why are you covered in sweat?

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.319
Did you bike here?

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.446
Why?

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.291
I don't know.
It was nice out.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.816
I didn't... I didn't really
give it much thought.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.207
I just sort of did it.
Can we please talk?

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.321
Okay, fine.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.490
Morn, I'm going out for,
like, one minute.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.839
I'll be right back, okay?

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.731
Okay, let's go down,
talk down here.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.479
It's nice to see you.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.970
What happened to you?

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.719
I got beat up by Ace.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.085
I mean, I deserved it, you know?

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.607
I don't think I have
the constitution

01:20:28.608 --> 01:20:31.604
to be a drug dealer.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.125
I mean, you know that.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.003
I came to tell you
that I miss you

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.643
and that I took for granted

01:20:43.644 --> 01:20:45.529
and that I know that
I took for you granted

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.120
and that I'm really, really
sorry I took you for granted.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.005
I'm making some of the changes
that we talked about, you know?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.759
You're still working, though?

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.039
Not anymore.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.646
I can live off
my savings for a while.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.645
You know, I made,
like, $25,000-ish,

01:21:06.646 --> 01:21:08.924
so I feel like
that should be all right.

01:21:08.925 --> 01:21:11.048
There was $25,000 under that bed

01:21:11.049 --> 01:21:12.919
I was sleeping in?

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.159
Probably more like $15,000
to $18,000 when you slept in it,

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.799
but...

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.279
Whatever, though, it's...
it's not worth it.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.439
You know that.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.568
I know.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.921
Do you think that writing
job's gonna work out?

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.042
Definitely not,
but I've been applying

01:21:31.043 --> 01:21:33.039
to a lot of other stuff,

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.039
but I feel like this
might be off-putting

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.805
to potential employers, but...

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.441
- Babe.
- Hi.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.844
Um...

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.440
That's your ex-boyfriend.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.090
Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.481
Um...

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.606
You probably should...

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.722
- Yeah.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.726
I'm so frustrated with myself.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.490
I don't know why
I do stupid things.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.602
I'm just, like, kind
of a fucking idiot, you know?

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.480
Can I tell you a secret?

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.241
Yeah.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.883
Hey!

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.999
Simon!
Simon, stop it!

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.287
Simon!
Come back.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.170
What are... what are you doing?
