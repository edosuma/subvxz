02:01.352 --> 02:02.399
What?

02:03.120 --> 02:04.839
- All the cops have wooden legs!
- They sure do!

02:16.714 --> 02:19.015
- All right, hold on!
- What is it?!

02:19.081 --> 02:21.220
Flat tire! Hold on!

02:23.658 --> 02:25.513
Oh, man.

02:27.691 --> 02:29.992
All right, I'm gonna find
a place to pull over.

03:05.615 --> 03:07.307
Oh, man.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.063
Excuse me.

03:11.216 --> 03:13.387
Hey, I like this place.

03:13.879 --> 03:15.945
Maybe we could build
some houses,

03:16.017 --> 03:17.708
just like
"Gilligan's Island."

03:18.897 --> 03:20.752
"Gilligan's Island"?

03:20.817 --> 03:23.306
After all
that's happened, Annie,

03:23.379 --> 03:25.004
what's wrong
with going home?

03:25.074 --> 03:27.331
Dad...

03:26.578 --> 03:29.546
- vacation was fine.
- Yeah, fine.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.953
Let's face it, Annie,

03:32.020 --> 03:34.321
it's just not the way
that it was.

03:35.379 --> 03:37.813
Dad, Mom's been dead
for two years.

03:37.525 --> 03:39.630
It's the way it is.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.667
We have lift-off.

03:46.645 --> 03:49.612
Honey, look, why don't you
just hit the cooler,

03:49.685 --> 03:51.726
get yourself some pop?
But stay close,

03:51.798 --> 03:53.391
'cause I want to fix
this tire

03:53.885 --> 03:55.567
and get on home.

04:14.809 --> 04:16.849
Hey, don't go
down there, kid.

04:16.921 --> 04:18.928
There's all kinds
of wild animals and shit.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.141
- Who do you belong to?
- Who do you belong to?

04:28.987 --> 04:32.053
Hey! Hey, you!
Hands off!

04:32.123 --> 04:34.938
Are you some kind
of a pervert or something?

04:35.004 --> 04:37.143
Johnny, you know better.
You don't even know this guy.

04:37.213 --> 04:39.634
I don't know you either, okay?

04:39.708 --> 04:41.650
He almost
went over the edge.

04:41.724 --> 04:44.952
There could be badgers
or something down there.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.025
Throw it.

04:50.655 --> 04:51.964
Come on, throw it.

04:53.183 --> 04:54.783
Well, throw it.

04:56.574 --> 04:58.714
Go back, come on.

05:19.555 --> 05:21.577
Wow, bald and flat.

05:22.217 --> 05:23.361
I feel for you, man.

05:25.986 --> 05:28.321
Sometimes life really sucks,
doesn't it?

05:51.239 --> 05:54.654
Looks like you just bought me
a tournament Frisbee, dude.

05:57.127 --> 05:58.621
I can get it back.
No sweat.

06:18.570 --> 06:21.091
Come on. What, are you guys
standing guard? Let's go.

06:22.538 --> 06:24.775
Come on, guys, let's go
the other way, okay?

06:36.684 --> 06:38.342
Johnny, come on.

06:56.432 --> 06:57.958
Ah, ha!

06:58.031 --> 06:59.558
I told you.

07:04.113 --> 07:05.967
Was I right,
or was I right?

07:27.754 --> 07:29.002
No playing here!

07:30.099 --> 07:31.627
You kids oughta
know better than...

07:32.660 --> 07:34.221
wait.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.417
You hear it?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.827
It could be anywhere
around here.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.406
Above us, behind us,

07:43.756 --> 07:45.584
or in the ground.

07:52.119 --> 07:55.378
Do you think this is
some kind of joke?

07:54.615 --> 07:57.070
You think this is
some kind of game?!

07:58.775 --> 08:01.646
They're hungry.
All they do is eat.

08:02.936 --> 08:05.718
You got to keep a weathered
eye out all the time!

08:05.784 --> 08:08.687
If you don't watch
every minute... then wham!

08:09.945 --> 08:12.280
Then it's too late.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.061
Who are you?

08:20.858 --> 08:23.826
Any of you ever hear
of a place called Grover's Bend?

08:25.563 --> 08:27.702
It's a real town
with real people.

08:27.771 --> 08:30.554
Now, in 1984...

08:31.740 --> 08:33.594
I was riding my bicycle

08:33.659 --> 08:35.732
and I looked up.

08:35.804 --> 08:38.554
I saw this thing
in the sky.

08:48.085 --> 08:50.900
Call the Army.
They're here!

08:52.095 --> 08:53.589
- Who?
- Who?!

08:53.663 --> 08:56.030
Them!

09:05.440 --> 09:08.224
On Earth I was just
a big nobody.

09:08.289 --> 09:10.361
Up in space I am
somebody.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.937
Charlie bounty hunter.

09:20.002 --> 09:22.785
Yeah, "Charlie
bounty hunter."

09:31.161 --> 09:32.126
Dad's all torn up
and Mom's got

09:32.196 --> 09:34.563
a harpoon thing in her neck,
and they're getting bigger.

09:38.725 --> 09:40.580
You're not
from around here, are you?

09:46.726 --> 09:49.115
I got to go where
the cosmic winds blow me.

09:51.975 --> 09:53.601
I got to...

09:53.671 --> 09:57.566
go where no man
has gone before.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.319
I'm a bounty hunter!

10:09.705 --> 10:12.870
Come on, you can't expect us
to believe this horseshit.

10:13.994 --> 10:15.750
You can believe
what you want, son.

10:15.818 --> 10:19.365
All I know is you got to get away
from here while you still can.

10:19.435 --> 10:22.188
Well, there's something
I can agree with.

10:21.611 --> 10:24.588
So walk away.

10:36.173 --> 10:37.602
There you go.

10:39.053 --> 10:42.781
Probably could've used that lug
wrench a little while longer.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.171
Got it.

10:45.614 --> 10:47.621
You should have had
your spare tire down here.

10:47.694 --> 10:49.702
Could've saved you
some traveling.

10:49.775 --> 10:54.252
Never know when you'll have
a flat tire on an antique like this.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.231
Are you supposed
to be scary?

10:57.296 --> 10:58.823
Me?

10:58.895 --> 11:00.390
No.

11:00.463 --> 11:03.115
It ain't me,
it's them.

11:03.185 --> 11:05.357
I've seen them.

11:05.425 --> 11:07.148
I've been
seeing them for...

11:08.657 --> 11:10.927
Look, you believe
in monsters?

11:13.138 --> 11:16.270
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

11:16.338 --> 11:18.728
That's what
I'm telling you about.

11:18.802 --> 11:20.907
Now, some friends
of mine from...

11:20.978 --> 11:22.766
a long way off,

11:22.579 --> 11:24.270
they gave me
a whole bunch of these.

11:24.339 --> 11:26.195
I only got
a couple left,

11:26.260 --> 11:29.327
but I want you
to have one.

11:30.996 --> 11:33.779
Now if this ever starts
to glow bright green,

11:33.845 --> 11:35.885
that's the time
to watch out for yourself.

11:35.957 --> 11:37.812
And your family.

11:37.877 --> 11:40.911
- Green.
- That's right, green.

11:44.118 --> 11:45.776
Annie! Johnny!

11:46.999 --> 11:50.180
- All aboard!
- We really have to go now.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.625
- Give my regards to Mars.
- Don't be so quick.

11:52.695 --> 11:54.387
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.127
You can have the rest
of my root beer.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.342
Thank you, partner.
It's my favorite.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.127
Johnny, come on now.

12:12.121 --> 12:13.976
Look what I found.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.416
What is it?

12:15.482 --> 12:17.588
I don't know. It looks
like a big electric bullet.

12:17.659 --> 12:19.252
Homemade.
He dropped it.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.138
Joshua!
Front and center, now.

12:24.284 --> 12:26.618
- Joshua?
- Josh, please.

12:26.684 --> 12:29.683
- Is that your father?
- Stepfather.

12:31.261 --> 12:34.295
Never, never will we trust you
out of our sight again.

12:34.365 --> 12:36.470
When I say five minutes,

12:37.036 --> 12:39.411
I don't mean seven,
I don't mean three.

12:39.486 --> 12:41.820
Discipline from now on,
young man. Hmm?

12:42.878 --> 12:45.912
I will not
and your mother will not...

12:47.902 --> 12:49.975
spare anymore rods.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.113
Is he going
to get spanked?

12:57.184 --> 12:59.779
I don't think his mom
is going to let that happen.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.970
Well, Big John, I guess
we had some adventure, huh?!

13:06.944 --> 13:08.189
Dad!

13:08.257 --> 13:09.948
Dad, you should
have seen it!

13:10.018 --> 13:13.117
- There was this strange guy...
- I really don't care.

13:13.186 --> 13:15.707
I told you two to stay close,
didn't I?

13:15.779 --> 13:18.168
Look at the two of you...
you're filthy.

13:18.243 --> 13:20.479
- Johnny, get in the truck.
- I know, Dad,

13:21.032 --> 13:23.362
but he came out of the ground
and scared the crap out of us.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.435
He scared the crap
out of us.

13:27.193 --> 13:27.938
Miss Sawyer...

13:28.004 --> 13:30.972
can we please watch
our language around Johnny?

13:37.286 --> 13:38.747
Shit.

13:43.975 --> 13:46.626
Look, honey, I just don't know
what to say to you.

13:48.167 --> 13:52.037
You could say that you're not
going on the road tomorrow.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.111
You could say that I'm not
old enough to take care of myself.

13:54.184 --> 13:55.646
Honey, you're not
being fair.

13:55.719 --> 13:58.786
Mr. and Mrs. Menges take
real good care of you guys.

13:58.857 --> 14:00.988
They're like family.
Hey...

14:02.089 --> 14:03.943
it's the best
that I can do.

14:04.008 --> 14:05.700
Besides, you're
a young woman now.

14:06.890 --> 14:09.278
Maybe I don't want
to be a young woman now.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.824
Grover's Bend?

14:34.349 --> 14:35.877
What a crock.

14:46.991 --> 14:48.846
You're listening
to Topeka's

14:48.911 --> 14:53.003
number one country radio station...
Country 107, KTPK.

14:57.072 --> 14:58.665
Hey, Frank,

14:58.736 --> 15:01.486
give me a hand with some
of this stuff, man.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.203
Absolutely, Mario.

15:05.393 --> 15:08.360
I am the handyman
after all.

15:11.153 --> 15:13.805
- You asshole.
- I heard that.

15:33.493 --> 15:35.981
Vaya con Dios, Mario.

15:36.054 --> 15:38.869
Four more units
to vacate, Jessie,

15:38.934 --> 15:41.106
and I'm a rich man.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.855
Hey, you got
the elevator fixed.

15:51.735 --> 15:53.197
Frankie.

15:53.272 --> 15:55.181
Hey, not for you, Rosie.

15:55.256 --> 15:58.284
There's still
a one-ton load limit.

15:58.937 --> 16:00.181
Ooh, you...

16:09.177 --> 16:12.310
Yo, yo, yo.
Check your weapons at the door,

16:12.379 --> 16:15.029
it's the chick
that walks like a man.

16:16.379 --> 16:18.965
Dating outside
our species now, huh?

16:19.035 --> 16:21.043
Oh, very funny.

16:21.116 --> 16:22.806
Very, very funny.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.501
I wasn't talking
to you, Frank.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.818
Yo, Marcia,

16:26.620 --> 16:28.987
I got a little
phone problem.

16:29.053 --> 16:32.283
Maybe you can come down to the
basement and check my equipment?

16:32.350 --> 16:36.474
Sorry, Frank,
I left my microscope upstairs.

16:36.749 --> 16:38.330
Ho-ho! Ho!

16:39.519 --> 16:41.144
She's killing me.

16:41.214 --> 16:43.254
Hey, Mario.

16:43.326 --> 16:45.620
I sure am sorry to see
you go, my friend.

16:46.310 --> 16:48.981
I just killed two rats
this morning.

16:48.639 --> 16:50.461
Rats?!

16:51.221 --> 16:52.949
Hey, Frank... rats.

16:53.024 --> 16:54.781
Hey, don't look at me.

16:54.848 --> 16:58.231
I got to see them
to "e-rat-icate" them.

16:59.904 --> 17:02.687
Yo, Jessie,
look who's home.

17:03.842 --> 17:05.020
Something's wrong.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.912
No brakes!

17:06.977 --> 17:10.077
No brakes!
Hold onto Johnny.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.940
Everybody all right?

17:19.011 --> 17:20.090
Yeah.

17:21.699 --> 17:23.292
Safe at home.

17:30.789 --> 17:32.513
Oh, man.

17:33.077 --> 17:35.843
I'm sorry, Mario.
No brakes.

17:35.910 --> 17:37.470
Something I can do?

17:37.677 --> 17:40.063
That's okay.

17:41.668 --> 17:43.429
Is everybody okay?

17:46.855 --> 17:49.349
So, Frank,

17:48.679 --> 17:50.752
you going to give us
a hand with this?

17:50.824 --> 17:52.198
No.

17:52.263 --> 17:54.086
I'm the maintenance man.

17:54.153 --> 17:55.843
He doesn't live here
anymore.

17:56.904 --> 17:58.693
Love you, Jessie.

17:59.784 --> 18:01.792
I'll be in my office.

18:01.865 --> 18:04.964
Listen, would you
clean up this junk?

18:06.505 --> 18:08.197
The guy's a waste
of protein.

18:08.267 --> 18:10.241
Yeah, but what
a snappy dresser.

18:10.314 --> 18:12.867
Dad, I'm gonna go say hello
to the Menges.

18:12.938 --> 18:15.208
Yeah, but don't go up
empty handed.

18:15.276 --> 18:16.999
You take something with,
all right?

18:28.044 --> 18:29.452
Ladies.

18:40.366 --> 18:42.057
Java.

18:47.728 --> 18:49.418
Fuck. Wh...?

18:51.888 --> 18:53.743
What's this?

18:56.432 --> 18:59.116
Oh, that's disgusting.

19:17.652 --> 19:20.140
Yeah, you're next, pal.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.267
Hey, girl.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.188
Going down to help Dad?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.944
I thought I might.

19:29.014 --> 19:31.021
I mean, we got ourselves
a loaded truck,

19:31.094 --> 19:32.785
an unloaded camper,
a car wreck...

19:32.854 --> 19:35.124
- I think they can use my help.
- Marcia?

19:35.190 --> 19:38.386
Are there any jobs down
at the phone company?

19:40.164 --> 19:41.745
What, you need a job?

19:42.935 --> 19:45.955
Ah, you want
Clifford home.

19:45.655 --> 19:48.110
Well, I was just thinking.

19:49.495 --> 19:51.187
We'll see what we can do.

19:52.696 --> 19:54.868
Yeah, we will.

20:03.738 --> 20:07.317
- Hello! Hello, Annie.
- Hello.

20:07.386 --> 20:09.841
Welcome home, dear.
Come in.

20:09.914 --> 20:12.468
Did you have
a wonderful trip?

20:12.539 --> 20:17.039
Dear, say hello to Annie. They've
just been to the Grand Canyon.

20:16.668 --> 20:21.011
Say, did you know they just
discovered an alien graveyard there?

20:21.084 --> 20:24.215
- Who did?
- Government.

20:24.284 --> 20:25.811
Secret.

20:25.884 --> 20:29.529
Wait till you taste
what I'm cooking today.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.216
Where's Johnny?
He'll love them.

20:32.286 --> 20:34.327
Tell me about
your trip, dear.

20:35.519 --> 20:38.333
Oh, yeah. Well, we froze
to death in Arizona,

20:38.399 --> 20:41.117
saw these Indian caves
in Mesa Verde,

20:41.184 --> 20:43.769
and met this weird lunatic
near Grover's Bend.

20:43.839 --> 20:45.661
He jumped right out
from the ground.

20:45.728 --> 20:47.768
So you had a good time?

20:47.839 --> 20:49.367
Grover's Bend?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.702
I'm making Mr. Menges'
favorite dish today.

20:52.768 --> 20:54.710
Ham and beans.

20:54.784 --> 20:57.338
Will you and Johnny
stay for dinner?

20:58.977 --> 21:01.944
No. It's our last night
together with Dad.

21:02.017 --> 21:04.091
He leaves on the 8:15
to Chicago.

21:04.162 --> 21:06.170
We better save
the tarts till later.

21:07.459 --> 21:10.307
I don't want your father to say
I spoiled your dinner...

21:10.371 --> 21:12.193
again.

21:16.739 --> 21:18.431
Hello, girls.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.191
How you doing, eh?

21:21.444 --> 21:23.233
Are you a little hungry?

21:23.300 --> 21:27.131
How about I give you to
the old farts upstairs tonight?

21:33.222 --> 21:35.230
Iris Arms apartment complex,

21:35.303 --> 21:38.330
Frank Longo
at your service.

21:37.702 --> 21:39.394
Longo, what's
the good news?

21:39.463 --> 21:41.951
Yo, right here.
Right here, Mr. Briggs.

21:42.024 --> 21:44.511
I hope you did
what I'm paying you for.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.274
Yes. Yes, I did.

21:46.343 --> 21:47.871
Yes, I did.

21:47.944 --> 21:50.791
Mario is history
as of right now.

21:50.856 --> 21:53.442
You promised me
all of them.

21:53.512 --> 21:56.001
- I lose my investors...
- Hey.

21:56.074 --> 21:57.797
The way I look at this,

21:57.865 --> 21:59.392
is that you are making

21:59.465 --> 22:02.248
all the "el giganto" profits
off the sale of this shithole,

22:02.314 --> 22:03.558
not little old moi.

22:04.184 --> 22:05.895
- You listen to me, Frank.
- Well...

22:05.962 --> 22:09.259
maybe it's time that you get
down here and get involved.

22:09.323 --> 22:11.559
I hired you so I wouldn't
have to get involved.

22:12.185 --> 22:15.337
I'm not lifting another finger
until you pay me for Mario!

22:15.403 --> 22:18.219
You got that?!
You can take that to the bank!

22:19.404 --> 22:20.931
Balls!

22:29.805 --> 22:31.333
Hello?

22:35.886 --> 22:37.413
Hello?

22:39.269 --> 22:40.395
Where are you?

22:46.288 --> 22:47.979
What are you doing out

22:48.048 --> 22:50.863
without Uncle Frankie's
permission, huh?

22:52.817 --> 22:56.166
Go back upstairs
where you belong!

22:58.130 --> 22:59.821
Work with me!

23:09.713 --> 23:13.035
What this dump needs
is a good four alarm fire.

23:17.114 --> 23:19.377
- Dad, dinner's getting cold.
- Coming.

23:20.948 --> 23:22.804
I want you to listen
to the Menges.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.008
Sometimes I think
you don't listen.

23:25.077 --> 23:27.498
I'll be back
Friday night.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.876
- Oh, toothpaste.
- Got it.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.790
You really should pack
some vitamins, too.

23:32.854 --> 23:35.472
And I want you to help her
make beds in the mornings.

23:35.542 --> 23:37.365
She's not a young woman,
you know.

23:38.711 --> 23:40.849
- I'm done.
- Can't you wait for Dad?

23:40.919 --> 23:43.735
Mr. M promised me
pirate stories.

23:48.184 --> 23:50.006
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:50.072 --> 23:51.928
- You be a good boy.
- Okay.

23:51.994 --> 23:54.001
- See ya.
- See ya.

23:59.450 --> 24:01.305
- Dad.
- Hmm?

24:02.490 --> 24:04.497
What's going to happen
to the Menges?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.262
I mean, where will
they go?

24:10.011 --> 24:12.018
We're going to have
to move too, you know.

24:12.091 --> 24:13.685
They'll get us out.

24:17.212 --> 24:20.180
Dad, you're going to have
to deal with this.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.970
You got to think about it,
make some decisions.

24:23.037 --> 24:25.373
Annie...

24:24.733 --> 24:26.457
I'm going
to eat my dinner,

24:26.525 --> 24:29.308
and then I'm going to watch
some moronic situation comedy,

24:29.374 --> 24:31.381
and then I'm going to sleep
the sleep of the dead.

24:31.454 --> 24:32.861
Can we worry
about this tomorrow?

25:10.435 --> 25:12.760
I love my work.

25:57.898 --> 25:59.392
Ow, ow, ow!

25:59.466 --> 26:01.026
Hot! Hot!

26:02.699 --> 26:04.706
Damn teenagers!

26:11.298 --> 26:12.162
Wh...?

26:54.098 --> 26:56.553
Oh! Oh, oh...

26:59.762 --> 27:01.323
Hairballs.

27:06.003 --> 27:07.563
Did you hear something?

27:07.905 --> 27:09.774
No.

27:09.844 --> 27:12.178
Tell Johnny bedtime,
one hour.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.284
That goes for you, too.

27:14.356 --> 27:17.040
Oh, and give this check
to Mrs. Menges.

27:17.109 --> 27:18.931
It's for taking care
of you guys.

27:18.997 --> 27:21.964
Tell her I'll cover
the rest of it when I get back.

27:23.286 --> 27:25.293
Dad, remember how much fun
we used to have?

27:29.206 --> 27:30.897
Yeah.

27:32.087 --> 27:33.777
What was I like then?

27:33.847 --> 27:35.057
Shorter.

27:47.161 --> 27:49.136
Dad...

27:49.209 --> 27:50.834
maybe I could
go get Johnny

27:50.905 --> 27:52.761
and we could play a game
or something.

27:52.826 --> 27:55.892
Honey, give me your
battery-powered TV, would you?

28:17.309 --> 28:19.065
Oh God.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.362
- Who's there?
- It's just me.

28:30.431 --> 28:32.122
Laundry night.

28:32.191 --> 28:34.296
I'm a little spooked
tonight, too.

28:34.367 --> 28:36.921
Did you hear
screaming before?

28:36.992 --> 28:38.938
It was probably
just Frank.

28:40.032 --> 28:42.367
- What is eating him?
- I don't know.

28:42.432 --> 28:44.799
Frank's just naturally
repulsive.

28:46.753 --> 28:50.201
Say hello to Mrs.
and Mr. Menges for me.

28:50.273 --> 28:52.030
Right.

29:22.374 --> 29:24.097
Aaah!

29:38.280 --> 29:39.970
Frank?

29:41.160 --> 29:43.582
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

29:44.936 --> 29:47.140
Talk to me, Frank.

29:48.457 --> 29:50.563
Frank?

29:51.128 --> 29:52.738
Frank? Hello?

29:55.498 --> 29:58.794
All right, Longo, very funny.
Enough is enough.

29:58.859 --> 30:00.386
Frank?

30:00.459 --> 30:02.793
We are not amused.

30:02.859 --> 30:05.991
Try to guess just how close
your termination is.

30:08.396 --> 30:10.830
Okay, it's your funeral,
wiseass.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.188
I'm coming over there and
taking care of things myself.

30:19.982 --> 30:23.081
We got another errand to do
before we sleep, sport.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.743
Business.

30:25.774 --> 30:27.597
Can't you just
drop me off at home?

30:27.933 --> 30:29.834
No way, sport.

30:29.902 --> 30:32.237
Someday this pool
will be yours.

30:32.303 --> 30:34.987
You're going to have
to learn how to swim in it.

30:38.352 --> 30:41.975
Looks like they'll have to meet
their landlord after all.

30:45.489 --> 30:50.574
See?
Grover's Bend, 1986.

30:51.236 --> 30:53.958
Now, you can see the same kind
of occurrence two years later...

30:54.034 --> 30:55.595
1988.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.522
Even local law enforcement

30:57.587 --> 31:01.297
claims they've seen
space aliens.

31:01.363 --> 31:04.331
One of them supposedly killed
a sheriff in the '88 encounter.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.931
A sheriff?

31:06.004 --> 31:09.003
Yes.
A sheriff wearing...

31:09.076 --> 31:11.599
an Easter Bunny suit.

31:10.805 --> 31:15.856
And I'll bet the aliens
were all wearing tuxedos.

31:15.925 --> 31:20.250
Of course, he must have been reading
the same newspapers as you.

31:19.766 --> 31:22.100
That's where he got the story
in the first place.

31:22.166 --> 31:23.594
Who? What guy?

31:23.930 --> 31:26.931
That crazy guy
we ran into on vacation.

31:26.743 --> 31:29.045
He actually believes
this stuff.

31:31.927 --> 31:34.415
Oh... I didn't mean...

31:34.487 --> 31:35.949
It's okay.

31:36.024 --> 31:37.933
Look, I'm sorry.

31:39.288 --> 31:42.485
I guess I'm still upset over
a fight I just had with my dad.

31:45.503 --> 31:46.835
I'm going to go back downstairs
and check on him.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.761
I'll be back
for Johnny in awhile.

31:49.849 --> 31:53.078
John, you still like
my stories, don't you?

31:54.267 --> 31:57.169
- It's him!
- Huh? Who?

32:01.308 --> 32:05.464
If it glows green, that's the time
to watch out for yourself.

32:09.308 --> 32:12.243
Her first frame
is a strike.

32:14.493 --> 32:18.068
Michelle led in the earlier
rounds in this tournament,

32:17.757 --> 32:21.751
and was the hot item around Southern
California when it came to sports.

32:21.822 --> 32:23.317
She really was.

32:23.391 --> 32:25.082
Yesterday,
in the second round...

32:25.151 --> 32:28.053
of match play, Steve,
she bowled incredibly.

32:28.127 --> 32:29.272
She had a 300...

32:40.929 --> 32:42.587
Hello?

32:49.090 --> 32:51.097
Frank?

32:56.931 --> 32:58.458
Frank, is that you...

32:59.972 --> 33:02.394
or some other rat?

33:02.756 --> 33:05.123
Well... huh.

33:21.413 --> 33:23.105
Terrific.

33:35.879 --> 33:38.052
You pervert.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.371
We got varmints.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.197
Frank,

33:48.266 --> 33:50.404
what in the wild world
of Geraldo

33:50.473 --> 33:52.165
is going on down here?

33:58.796 --> 34:00.967
Oh my God.

34:14.572 --> 34:16.645
Oh, no!
What is it?!

34:20.110 --> 34:22.053
Aaah!

34:36.496 --> 34:38.188
There's more of them!

34:39.408 --> 34:40.870
Get away.
Get away.

34:59.059 --> 35:02.256
Oh, no, no!
No, please!

35:02.323 --> 35:03.916
What are these things?!

35:03.988 --> 35:07.022
Annie! Annie, help me!
Get it off, get it off!

35:10.164 --> 35:11.954
Get me out of this.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.331
Oh, Annie, hurry!

35:13.397 --> 35:15.404
Hurry, they're going
to come again!

35:15.477 --> 35:18.161
- Rosalie, give me some slack!
- Okay. Ow!

35:21.302 --> 35:23.604
It hurts.
It hurts.

35:25.174 --> 35:27.614
Frank.

35:26.839 --> 35:29.228
Oh, Annie, let's
get out of here!

35:29.304 --> 35:31.246
Annie!

36:00.347 --> 36:01.907
Annie!

36:01.980 --> 36:03.507
Come on!

36:03.580 --> 36:05.074
Help me here. Okay.

36:05.148 --> 36:08.345
Feast your eyes on the future
site of Briggs' Mini Mall.

36:08.413 --> 36:10.105
Nice concept, huh?

36:10.174 --> 36:11.996
Naming it after
yours truly.

36:12.061 --> 36:14.035
But Mom said
the court ordered you

36:14.109 --> 36:17.307
to pay them money to move,
to relocate.

36:17.374 --> 36:19.895
Not if they move
on their own accord, sport.

36:21.406 --> 36:23.097
"Sport."

36:23.167 --> 36:26.299
There are much simpler ways
to sweep and clear.

36:26.367 --> 36:27.993
You'll see.

36:28.064 --> 36:30.402
You'll learn.

36:29.823 --> 36:31.514
Come on.

36:31.583 --> 36:33.111
I'll teach you.

36:41.345 --> 36:43.385
Oh God, please make
this a dream.

36:43.457 --> 36:45.345
Rosalie, come on!

36:45.409 --> 36:47.450
Come on.
Dad!

36:47.523 --> 36:49.530
- Dad!
- What?!

36:52.067 --> 36:53.977
Dad!

36:54.051 --> 36:55.295
Dad!

36:58.275 --> 37:01.343
- Oh, Dad, it was awful.
- There are things. They're huge!

37:01.413 --> 37:04.031
They're gigantic.
They're like rats! Rats!

37:04.101 --> 37:06.305
No, Tasmanian devils.

37:06.373 --> 37:07.998
- Slow down!
- Dozens of 'em.

37:08.068 --> 37:10.557
And they attacked me.
They had these white fang teeth.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.636
And they bit me!
They bit me on my leg!

37:13.669 --> 37:16.059
Oh my God,
I'm bleeding.

37:17.830 --> 37:19.259
Sit over here,
Rosie.

37:19.334 --> 37:22.029
Dad, they're little
animals...

37:21.798 --> 37:23.490
just like the ones
in the paper.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.567
They've got lots
of sharp teeth.

37:25.639 --> 37:28.060
They're nasty things...
nasty things with sharp teeth.

37:28.135 --> 37:30.290
They're things
from outer space.

37:30.471 --> 37:31.524
You can ask Mr. Menges
about it.

37:31.593 --> 37:33.960
Dad, they're aliens!

37:34.024 --> 37:36.581
Aliens in the basement?

37:35.848 --> 37:37.441
You have to believe her!
They're huge.

37:37.512 --> 37:40.328
They're like badger, possums...
they're big cats.

37:40.393 --> 37:43.592
You got to listen to her,
they're awful!

37:42.858 --> 37:44.996
Rosie, calm down,
calm down.

37:45.066 --> 37:47.936
- You just saw a rat.
- Will you look at her leg?

37:50.463 --> 37:51.145
Oh, Rosie.

37:51.210 --> 37:53.284
A rat did this to you?
This is serious.

37:53.355 --> 37:56.290
They're not rats. They got
Frank in the basement.

37:56.363 --> 37:58.534
- They got Frank?
- They got Frank!

37:58.603 --> 38:00.131
They got Frank!

38:09.581 --> 38:11.075
Dad! Oh...

38:12.461 --> 38:14.350
Dad, come on.

38:18.094 --> 38:19.239
Aaah!

38:23.215 --> 38:24.644
Dad, come on!

38:24.908 --> 38:26.508
What are those things?!

38:27.823 --> 38:30.858
Go, go, go!

38:30.928 --> 38:34.310
In two tournaments I've seen
her shoot those 300 games.

38:34.384 --> 38:36.239
She can throw
the strikes.

38:46.066 --> 38:48.303
- She makes a strike.
- Eat that.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.107
God damn it.

38:52.179 --> 38:54.187
You see, sport?

38:54.259 --> 38:58.352
All kinds of animals
follow them around.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.387
These people are animals. Pretty
soon you can't tell them apart.

39:01.460 --> 39:04.558
The people, the pets...
they've all got fleas.

39:09.301 --> 39:10.828
This'll get
their attention.

39:12.982 --> 39:14.640
Their attention for what?

39:15.205 --> 39:16.685
Our little panic...

39:17.846 --> 39:19.308
casserole.

39:21.079 --> 39:23.348
You think they're screaming
and carrying on now?

39:23.415 --> 39:25.652
Just wait till I cut off
their communication

39:25.836 --> 39:27.410
with their social
workers.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.891
Hello?

39:31.961 --> 39:33.651
Hello?

39:34.842 --> 39:36.696
That's funny.

39:37.238 --> 39:39.096
I lost contact
with Grover's Bend.

39:42.362 --> 39:45.658
What did he mean,
"Watch out for yourself"?

39:54.363 --> 39:56.218
Third floor...

39:56.283 --> 39:58.291
second floor...

39:58.364 --> 40:00.022
first floor...

40:02.044 --> 40:03.418
basement.

40:05.242 --> 40:07.312
Who turned out
the lights?!

40:08.605 --> 40:10.459
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh, Dad.

40:10.525 --> 40:12.697
How many stairs are
in this place anyway?

40:13.243 --> 40:15.100
Wait, we just went up
these stairs.

40:15.166 --> 40:16.857
- I'm dizzy.
- Come on.

40:16.926 --> 40:18.650
What's your problem?

40:19.214 --> 40:22.843
- I just want to rest.
- What are you guys doing down here?

40:22.911 --> 40:24.820
Marcia, come and help!
They're passing out.

40:24.895 --> 40:27.449
There are things,
they're like big rats.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.942
Only they bite and...
I forget.

40:30.016 --> 40:32.155
They're aliens.

40:32.224 --> 40:33.687
Porcupines!

40:34.166 --> 40:35.671
Mrs. Menges!
Mrs. Menges!

40:37.025 --> 40:38.432
Come on, Cliff.

40:38.497 --> 40:40.221
Let me help you.
Lean on me.

40:40.289 --> 40:41.337
Up. Up.

40:41.410 --> 40:43.133
That's it.

40:43.202 --> 40:46.071
- Who are you?
- Marcia.

40:46.146 --> 40:47.673
You know me, Cliff.
Come on.

40:48.008 --> 40:49.274
- Marcia?
- Yeah. Come on.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.618
- Up, up. That's it.
- Yeah, okay.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.509
Thank you.

41:00.868 --> 41:02.526
Porcupines?

41:04.010 --> 41:06.083
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

41:06.149 --> 41:09.117
Your landlord is here
to evict you.

41:15.846 --> 41:17.636
Jeez, a rat did that?

41:17.703 --> 41:20.965
Looks like I'll have to charge
somebody for a new door.

41:22.407 --> 41:24.130
Give me the keys.
I'll wait in the car.

41:24.199 --> 41:26.917
Forget it.
We're in this together.

41:28.968 --> 41:30.975
I thought you cut off
all the power.

41:31.048 --> 41:32.904
I did cut off
all the power.

41:34.569 --> 41:36.456
Can we just go?

41:36.521 --> 41:39.839
They must have tapped
into the emergency system.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.540
Hello?

41:45.575 --> 41:47.656
It's your landlord.

41:48.971 --> 41:52.287
I have matters to discuss.

41:52.363 --> 41:55.047
...chicken has a wishbone,
which I'll cut out.

41:55.116 --> 41:57.866
All this makes
perfectly marvelous soup.

41:59.404 --> 42:01.707
You have to get
the leg bones out

42:02.178 --> 42:03.464
from the legs
and the wing side.

42:03.533 --> 42:05.540
And the way
to do that is...

42:05.613 --> 42:07.304
push the bones through.

42:07.373 --> 42:11.116
And then take...
there's the... ball joint

42:11.182 --> 42:14.329
of your roast chicken.

42:14.499 --> 42:16.174
We'll have our work done
in a minute, sport.

42:17.711 --> 42:19.566
Don't call me "sport."

42:23.312 --> 42:26.378
You're not a crybaby, too,
are you, sport?

42:40.114 --> 42:41.640
I hate you.

42:41.714 --> 42:43.373
I wish you were dead!

42:48.211 --> 42:49.389
Sport?

42:53.556 --> 42:55.410
Sport!

43:06.837 --> 43:08.267
Hey, come on.

43:08.342 --> 43:10.382
Let me in.
Let him go.

43:10.454 --> 43:12.657
Hey. Hey!

43:11.893 --> 43:14.065
Hey, come on. He can't help
being an asshole!

43:14.134 --> 43:15.477
What are you doing?

43:15.543 --> 43:18.838
You're ready to remove
the bones.

43:19.428 --> 43:21.508
Hey, come on.
He just wants to talk to you!

43:20.886 --> 43:23.189
Leave him alone!
Let him go!

43:23.256 --> 43:25.296
Let him go!

43:25.368 --> 43:27.026
Hey, what's the matter?

43:27.096 --> 43:29.105
They've got him.
They're tearing him apart.

43:29.177 --> 43:30.867
- They're killing him!
- Who?! They've got who?

43:30.937 --> 43:33.260
Wait. Stop, stop.
Step back.

43:33.977 --> 43:35.187
Stay back.

44:29.601 --> 44:31.292
- Come on!
- What's going on?

44:31.361 --> 44:32.506
Never mind.
Run! Go!

44:32.577 --> 44:35.399
This way. Come on.

44:34.882 --> 44:36.408
Let's go.

44:36.481 --> 44:38.336
No, no, wait!
I can't just leave him there.

44:38.401 --> 44:40.856
That guy you were with,
your dad?

44:40.929 --> 44:42.425
Stepfather.

44:42.498 --> 44:45.662
I don't know what the hell
is going on down there,

44:45.730 --> 44:47.618
but I just saw
something there.

44:47.683 --> 44:50.237
There's animals,
some kind of hungry things.

44:50.308 --> 44:53.057
I don't know,
but he's dead, hon.

44:54.244 --> 44:55.902
There's nothing
we can do for him.

44:58.212 --> 45:00.547
- What's your name?
- Josh.

45:00.613 --> 45:03.002
Okay, Josh...

45:06.662 --> 45:08.036
Get back!

45:10.022 --> 45:12.128
Oh, look!

45:12.199 --> 45:14.206
- Come on!
- Do you have any more flares?

45:14.278 --> 45:16.264
Fresh out!

45:28.584 --> 45:30.494
What?

45:32.105 --> 45:33.480
Let us in!

45:36.106 --> 45:39.554
- Close the door!
- Josh!

45:41.099 --> 45:43.881
- Annie.
- Come on, help me move this desk.

45:46.667 --> 45:49.603
- Swing it around that way.
- What are you doing here?

45:49.676 --> 45:51.563
- I came with her.
- Marcia?

45:51.627 --> 45:53.864
Push it up against the door.
Right up tight.

45:53.932 --> 45:55.559
Great.
That should hold them.

45:57.069 --> 45:59.371
Josh, how did you get here?

46:00.749 --> 46:03.117
There's monsters outside,
aren't there?

46:04.686 --> 46:06.409
Yeah, there are monsters
out there.

46:06.478 --> 46:09.195
- Anybody check the phone?
- It's dead, like the lights.

46:11.086 --> 46:13.061
I still don't know
what the hell is going on here.

46:13.135 --> 46:15.044
Ain't no rats,
you can be sure of that.

46:16.686 --> 46:18.062
What are you
talking about?

46:18.128 --> 46:21.259
Did you ever see one of these
come out of any rat you've seen?

46:24.208 --> 46:25.900
Ain't no rats.

46:39.166 --> 46:41.421
Must be venom...
poison.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.195
They're here!

46:54.261 --> 46:56.562
I saw the door downstairs,
they chewed right through it.

47:05.973 --> 47:07.981
What do you say we barricade
the kitchen door?

47:09.271 --> 47:10.645
What kitchen door?

47:14.743 --> 47:17.362
Mr. Menges, you don't have
a gun up here

47:17.431 --> 47:18.576
or anything like that?

47:18.647 --> 47:20.338
I got a great
Civil War pistol.

47:20.408 --> 47:22.645
I used to have a frame
for it.

47:22.712 --> 47:24.306
I got no powder.

47:24.377 --> 47:26.035
How about a big knife?

47:26.105 --> 47:29.400
How about
a meat cleaver, dear?

47:34.234 --> 47:36.241
You find anything there?

47:36.314 --> 47:37.688
No.

47:42.235 --> 47:43.577
Wait.

47:43.643 --> 47:46.575
What's that?

47:46.545 --> 47:49.681
Oh. As I recall,
that's a little storage area.

47:49.756 --> 47:53.052
Mr. Menges and I haven't
crawled up there in years.

47:53.117 --> 47:55.086
Josh, come here!

47:54.876 --> 47:56.698
Do you have a footstool
or something?

47:56.765 --> 47:58.139
In the pantry.

48:16.992 --> 48:19.294
Hey, you guys,
check this out.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.695
Mrs. Menges, does this
connect with the roof?

48:21.760 --> 48:23.932
I really don't know
where that goes.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.130
You get up there
and you crawl...

48:26.881 --> 48:28.310
crawl that direction,

48:28.384 --> 48:30.011
and you'll hit
the elevator shaft.

48:30.082 --> 48:32.635
- You don't know that.
- I'll get the others.

48:32.706 --> 48:35.423
Sure I do. I've stored
stuff up there.

48:43.523 --> 48:46.533
Do you think you guys
can climb a ladder?

48:45.923 --> 48:47.450
No ladder.

48:47.524 --> 48:49.761
Go up a ladder
tomorrow.

48:50.233 --> 48:50.909
No.

48:50.980 --> 48:53.119
No tomorrow.

48:53.188 --> 48:55.359
I can't do this
anymore, Dad!

48:55.428 --> 48:56.890
Move your ass, now!

49:00.550 --> 49:03.168
Now.

49:05.221 --> 49:06.913
Come on, Clifford.

49:06.983 --> 49:09.317
We've been climbing
three flights of stairs

49:09.382 --> 49:11.237
ever since that elevator
broke down.

49:11.303 --> 49:13.311
Come on.
You can do it.

49:27.529 --> 49:29.155
It's gotten too quiet
out there.

49:29.225 --> 49:30.599
I don't like it.

49:30.666 --> 49:32.356
They'll just get in
some other way.

49:32.425 --> 49:33.899
We got to get out
of here!

49:34.559 --> 49:36.169
Rosalie, come on.
We got to go. You're next.

49:36.235 --> 49:38.209
I'll watch the door.

49:38.282 --> 49:40.038
- Oh, no.
- Up, Rosalie.

49:40.106 --> 49:42.115
- Right.
- All right.

49:42.187 --> 49:44.675
- Come on, you can do it.
- I'll help you.

49:51.020 --> 49:52.482
You know...

49:52.557 --> 49:54.248
if we can make it
to the roof,

49:54.317 --> 49:56.651
I can get to
the junction box outside,

49:56.717 --> 49:58.986
tie into the phone lines,
call for help.

50:00.205 --> 50:02.376
- You can do that?
- Hey, I can do anything...

50:02.446 --> 50:04.006
I work for
the phone company.

50:04.079 --> 50:07.013
- Push.
- Ow, ow, ow.

50:07.086 --> 50:09.029
- Up, Rosalie.
- Push.

50:09.102 --> 50:10.411
Come on. Go.

50:11.535 --> 50:14.088
- Push, fair Rosie, come on!
- Help.

50:14.159 --> 50:17.094
Push!
Push, Josh.

50:17.168 --> 50:19.340
We've come this far.
Come on, help her.

50:21.649 --> 50:25.616
Look, dear, the quilt that
Aunt Carolyn gave us, remember?

50:24.945 --> 50:27.377
Yeah, I remember.
Come on, let's go.

50:31.377 --> 50:33.217
Everybody be calm.

50:32.913 --> 50:34.670
Go!

50:50.036 --> 50:51.498
Go... quick!

50:54.388 --> 50:56.244
Grab that, quick!

50:57.750 --> 50:59.441
- Go!
- They're over here!

52:10.655 --> 52:12.346
Josh, come on.
Keep going.

52:12.415 --> 52:15.230
- Which way do I go?
- Give me the flashlight.

52:15.295 --> 52:17.533
Kids, here!
Right through there.

52:19.457 --> 52:21.945
You stay with them and try
and keep everybody together.

52:22.016 --> 52:23.610
I'm gonna check out
this direction.

52:23.681 --> 52:25.754
Marcia! Be careful.

52:41.347 --> 52:43.735
Come on, Annie.

52:42.979 --> 52:44.354
Annie.

52:54.534 --> 52:56.290
It won't open.

53:01.158 --> 53:02.587
Please!

53:08.680 --> 53:10.818
It won't open.

53:11.499 --> 53:13.222
We're trapped.

53:13.287 --> 53:14.695
Where's Marcia?

53:25.161 --> 53:27.131
Oh, damn it.

53:28.431 --> 53:29.573
I'm lost.

53:36.524 --> 53:38.531
Josh...

53:38.603 --> 53:40.458
what are you
doing here?

53:42.124 --> 53:44.714
I came here
with my stepdad.

53:51.821 --> 53:54.058
We came here
to evict you.

53:58.061 --> 53:59.753
I didn't want
to come.

54:03.342 --> 54:05.001
Pretty awful, huh?

54:06.223 --> 54:07.630
Yeah.

54:10.587 --> 54:11.813
I just can't believe
he's dead.

54:13.744 --> 54:16.046
Josh...

54:16.112 --> 54:18.316
my mom died.

54:19.344 --> 54:21.036
Not like your dad,

54:22.065 --> 54:23.592
but she died.

54:27.189 --> 54:29.200
But I bet you didn't wish
for your mom to die.

54:33.267 --> 54:35.689
I just wish we could
go back to this morning.

54:38.547 --> 54:41.133
I just wish we could figure out
how to use this thing.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.087
Look...

55:48.157 --> 55:50.524
if nobody can think
of anything better,

55:50.590 --> 55:53.557
one of us has got to make it
to the street and run for help.

55:53.629 --> 55:56.946
The only way I know
to get around them things

55:57.022 --> 55:59.607
is this elevator shaft.

55:59.678 --> 56:00.606
Hey.

56:00.670 --> 56:02.361
I got a better idea.

56:20.513 --> 56:22.301
How do you get
to the box?

56:22.369 --> 56:24.279
Redundant cable.

56:24.353 --> 56:26.209
Keeps the lines
from blowing down.

56:26.274 --> 56:29.636
It ought to hold my weight
long enough for me to...

56:31.074 --> 56:32.601
get connected.

56:33.796 --> 56:35.486
I'm down to 119.

56:35.555 --> 56:37.825
Marcia, you're going
to die out there.

56:38.287 --> 56:40.347
Any calls you want me
to make for you?

56:41.700 --> 56:43.740
Come on.
Belay me.

56:50.693 --> 56:52.384
Adios.

57:18.985 --> 57:21.254
Oh God.

57:26.538 --> 57:27.815
Josh!

57:28.134 --> 57:29.409
Josh, we're on fire!

57:33.259 --> 57:34.786
One thing at a time.

57:35.255 --> 57:37.510
Marcia, one thing
at a time.

57:40.397 --> 57:42.054
- Oh my God. Marcia!
- Marcia!

57:49.581 --> 57:51.850
She's swinging.
She's swinging!

57:52.458 --> 57:53.260
Annie, it's okay...

57:57.422 --> 57:58.851
Thank you.
Thank you.

58:00.431 --> 58:03.333
Phone. Phone!

58:03.407 --> 58:05.032
Phone, phone.

58:06.671 --> 58:09.020
Let's go.

58:10.064 --> 58:12.714
Yes. Go. Yes!

58:14.705 --> 58:16.396
Oh no.

58:16.465 --> 58:18.521
Damn. Damn.

58:22.546 --> 58:24.442
Go, go!

58:23.986 --> 58:26.255
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes!

58:26.322 --> 58:27.751
No! No, no.

58:27.826 --> 58:29.201
Yes, yes.

58:37.064 --> 58:38.575
I can do this.

58:54.006 --> 58:55.500
Annie.

58:57.686 --> 58:59.214
I'm going for help.

58:59.286 --> 59:01.742
It's okay. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

59:05.271 --> 59:06.450
Annie.

59:07.608 --> 59:09.779
Annie!
Don't go down there.

59:09.847 --> 59:11.855
That's too dangerous.
You come on back here.

59:12.468 --> 59:13.784
Let somebody else
do that.

59:16.469 --> 59:17.456
Second floor.

01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:05.559
Nothing to it.

01:01:56.431 --> 01:01:58.700
All right, get back...
get back into the elevator.

01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:01.229
I got you, you hear?

01:02:18.194 --> 01:02:19.470
Oh, gee.

01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:24.475
It's jammed.

01:02:24.019 --> 01:02:26.353
It's okay.
Sometimes it does this.

01:02:27.859 --> 01:02:29.714
What?!

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.635
You came here
just in time.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.627
Where's your family?
Take me to them.

01:02:38.037 --> 01:02:40.241
Well, the elevator's stuck.
We have to climb.

01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:43.148
How did you get here?

01:02:43.221 --> 01:02:45.048
A gentlemen called me.

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:46.356
A real nice fella.

01:02:53.623 --> 01:02:55.879
All right.

01:03:20.185 --> 01:03:22.423
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:03:23.547 --> 01:03:26.132
Hold on!
Floor, please?!

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.577
The roof!

01:03:38.525 --> 01:03:40.052
Somebody help us
out of here.

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:42.645
I'm stuck.

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:59.161
Hey, it's you.

01:03:59.232 --> 01:04:01.436
Yeah, what's left of me.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.097
The building
is burning downstairs.

01:04:03.168 --> 01:04:04.509
We've got
to get on the roof.

01:04:10.689 --> 01:04:12.063
Don't look. Don't...

01:04:12.129 --> 01:04:14.497
be casual.

01:04:14.561 --> 01:04:17.823
Who is that hunk that
just came in with your daughter?

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:29.119
Charlie.

01:04:30.851 --> 01:04:33.699
- Hi.
- How you doing, partner?

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.828
I guess you were right
about those things.

01:04:39.273 --> 01:04:41.120
See if you can pry
that bullet out of there.

01:04:41.189 --> 01:04:42.717
My fingers are too big.

01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:45.731
What about Marcia?

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.365
Yes. Yes!

01:04:56.358 --> 01:04:58.247
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:05:08.873 --> 01:05:12.169
Please deposit 25¢
for the first three minutes.

01:05:12.233 --> 01:05:13.608
Damn!

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.388
I hate operators.

01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:33.579
Quiet.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.747
Everybody quiet.

01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:46.530
If you're quiet,
you can hear them moving.

01:06:12.113 --> 01:06:13.837
- Annie, my gun.
- I'm trying!

01:06:13.906 --> 01:06:15.182
It won't come out.

01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:24.142
All right,
keep your eyes on them.

01:06:25.555 --> 01:06:26.799
Look 'em in the eye.

01:06:28.787 --> 01:06:30.576
They'll telegraph
their every move.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.518
I hate you!

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.407
Josh!

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.721
You leave
my husband alone!

01:07:23.336 --> 01:07:24.401
Annie.

01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:27.632
Annie?

01:07:32.764 --> 01:07:34.652
Charlie!

01:07:40.218 --> 01:07:41.373
Open wide.

01:07:55.615 --> 01:07:57.241
We got 'em!

01:07:58.368 --> 01:07:59.448
Come on, let's go!

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.870
Mobile Ops 7707.

01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:04.635
Emergency.

01:08:05.729 --> 01:08:06.776
Oh God!

01:08:11.585 --> 01:08:13.112
Come on, Johnny.

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:20.792
Stay here.

01:08:23.907 --> 01:08:26.721
Fire! Help us!

01:08:26.787 --> 01:08:28.478
Can anyone hear me?!

01:08:28.546 --> 01:08:30.238
Please, help us!

01:08:30.308 --> 01:08:32.154
Can't you see us?!

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.234
We're on fire!

01:08:34.308 --> 01:08:36.163
Come over here.
Somebody help!

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:38.749
It's really burning.
Up there, can you hear us?!

01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:41.086
- There's a fire here!
- Is anybody up there?!

01:08:41.776 --> 01:08:43.200
- What are we going to do?
- Hang on. Hang on.

01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:45.604
- We'll be all right.
- Please, help us.

01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:47.197
You were wonderful.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:49.087
You were wonderful.

01:08:49.777 --> 01:08:51.858
- Thank you very much.
- You saved us all.

01:08:51.112 --> 01:08:52.671
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:08:52.743 --> 01:08:56.158
Please, fire!
Come on!

01:08:57.191 --> 01:08:59.259
Fire!

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:22.660
Somebody help us!
We're on fire!

01:09:26.603 --> 01:09:28.295
Are you okay?

01:09:34.156 --> 01:09:36.229
Can you stand?

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:37.611
No, I can't.

01:09:39.693 --> 01:09:41.930
Johnny, get away
from the edge!

01:09:42.385 --> 01:09:43.689
But Marcia's down there.

01:09:43.758 --> 01:09:45.700
I don't care.
Get over here now!

01:09:47.533 --> 01:09:49.870
Listen to me.
Get over here!

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:51.594
Look, Annie, look!

01:09:59.664 --> 01:10:00.908
Charlie!

01:10:10.258 --> 01:10:12.844
- I got you.
- Help!

01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:17.546
Don't look down.

01:10:17.618 --> 01:10:19.310
Annie, don't let go!

01:10:21.876 --> 01:10:23.402
Annie, I'm slipping.

01:10:23.475 --> 01:10:24.904
Hold on, Johnny.

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.119
Please,
somebody help me!

01:10:39.158 --> 01:10:40.685
I got you.

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.613
I got you.
I got you.

01:10:49.559 --> 01:10:51.250
I love you.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.491
Help!

01:10:57.561 --> 01:11:00.627
- Charlie?
- Help!

01:11:00.696 --> 01:11:02.070
Get help!

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:06.766
Charlie.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.275
Throw me a rope.
Get a rope!

01:11:25.341 --> 01:11:26.867
Dad, we got to do
something.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.348
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.301
Charlie, look out.

01:11:57.472 --> 01:12:01.335
Hey... I hope you'll
let me down easier than that.

01:12:39.687 --> 01:12:41.377
Outer space all right.

01:12:41.446 --> 01:12:43.301
No doubt about it.
We can prove it.

01:12:43.366 --> 01:12:46.499
- We could've proved it except...
- It was all burnt up in there.

01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:48.574
Documented proof.
All my papers.

01:12:48.647 --> 01:12:50.654
Actual physical evidence...
gone.

01:12:53.768 --> 01:12:55.590
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:01.320
Oh. I'll be
over there, okay?

01:13:02.825 --> 01:13:05.607
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:13:07.402 --> 01:13:09.791
So... how 'bout
getting together sometime,

01:13:09.866 --> 01:13:11.393
and doing
something normal?

01:13:12.906 --> 01:13:15.722
- Normal like a movie?
- Yeah.

01:13:20.747 --> 01:13:22.920
Charlie!

01:13:23.285 --> 01:13:24.515
Don't go.

01:13:28.108 --> 01:13:29.483
Listen, partner,

01:13:29.549 --> 01:13:31.886
how's that
crystal doing?

01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:38.284
Yeah.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.877
See?

01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:41.641
There's no more
problem.

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.482
- You don't need me anymore.
- Johnny.

01:13:45.551 --> 01:13:47.242
Come here a minute.

01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:49.128
Bye, Charlie.

01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:51.533
Bye, John.

01:13:57.179 --> 01:13:59.496
Are you leaving
today, Daddy?

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:01.576
I think I finally got
the message

01:14:01.649 --> 01:14:03.624
you guys want me
to stay close to home.

01:14:03.697 --> 01:14:05.355
My uniform's
all burnt up,

01:14:05.426 --> 01:14:07.979
so I think the railroad
can get along without me.

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:15.185
Dad, can we survive?

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.422
Well, we've just been
talking about that.

01:14:17.491 --> 01:14:19.346
I think I'll check out
those jobs

01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:20.754
down at
the phone company.

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.991
And between the Menges
and us,

01:14:23.663 --> 01:14:24.784
we'll work something out.

01:14:24.852 --> 01:14:27.700
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:14:27.765 --> 01:14:30.515
- I'm Josh's mother.
- How do you do?

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:34.482
Josh has told me about
all you've done for him.

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:36.460
And my husband...

01:14:36.534 --> 01:14:39.698
my late husband, he owes you
people quite a bit of money.

01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:43.116
- He does?
- It's called a relocation fee.

01:14:43.191 --> 01:14:45.842
And I think with that,
you'd be able to stay in a hotel

01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:47.472
until we get
the place rebuilt.

01:14:47.543 --> 01:14:51.122
- That is, if you'd be interested.
- We're interested.

01:14:51.192 --> 01:14:52.883
And thank you.

01:14:54.747 --> 01:14:56.406
Why don't we introduce
ourselves?

01:14:56.472 --> 01:14:59.343
Johnny, where's your friend
from Grover's Bend?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:03.480
Charlie?

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:04.920
He left.

01:15:04.986 --> 01:15:07.801
Just like one
of those westerns.

01:15:07.866 --> 01:15:11.347
No. No.

01:17:11.787 --> 01:17:14.121
All right, you gumballs.

01:18:00.613 --> 01:18:01.510
What is that?

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:48.309
Bounty hunter Charles McFadden,
Earth sector...

01:18:48.376 --> 01:18:49.685
you are in violation.

01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:51.607
Violation?

01:18:51.673 --> 01:18:55.447
Wait a second.
I'm just killing Critters here.

01:18:55.512 --> 01:18:57.203
That is...

01:18:58.393 --> 01:19:00.662
there was a confirmed
infestation...

01:19:00.730 --> 01:19:02.486
of Crites.

01:19:03.514 --> 01:19:05.008
Charlie.

01:19:07.739 --> 01:19:09.200
Is that you in there?

01:19:23.356 --> 01:19:25.164
Charlie, my friend.

01:19:26.877 --> 01:19:29.175
Wow. It's great
to see you.

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:31.935
And you as well.

01:19:37.215 --> 01:19:38.906
You're looking good.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:41.466
We just received
your bio alert.

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:43.191
Yeah, yeah.
What was that all about?

01:19:43.264 --> 01:19:46.263
Specifically,
you are prohibited

01:19:46.336 --> 01:19:48.507
from terminating
any transgalactic lifeform

01:19:48.576 --> 01:19:50.715
if it means total extinction
of the species.

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:52.672
Oh, yeah.
But they're dangerous.

01:19:52.737 --> 01:19:54.493
You taught me
how dangerous they are.

01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:56.536
Aggression factor
is irrelevant.

01:19:56.609 --> 01:19:59.359
Those two eggs
are the last two eggs.

01:19:59.426 --> 01:20:01.728
The intergalactic council
has dispatched

01:20:01.794 --> 01:20:03.452
a specimen collection pod.

01:20:03.521 --> 01:20:05.246
You are instructed
to place the eggs

01:20:05.314 --> 01:20:07.322
into the receptacle
in the pod.

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:11.361
The council is sending
a pod here?

01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:12.666
Come on, Ug...

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:15.489
Good luck, Charlie,
my friend.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.427
Yeah, but Ug...

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.742
