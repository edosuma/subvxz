13:40.069 --> 13:44.030
Can you imagine a commercial jet
twice the size with half the weight?

13:44.198 --> 13:46.407
Commercial airlines.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.495
You really do wanna put me
out of business, huh?

14:19.483 --> 14:22.610
PHlLLlP: Remember, there was 20 people--
LlLLlAN: I love this.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.113
I can't believe l did this.
And then--

14:25.281 --> 14:27.282
Well, look who's finally home.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.409
Henry,
Paul's been waiting here for hours.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.952
Hello, Henry.
HENRY: Hey, Paul.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.162
I know. I'm late.
Could have called.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.876
Henry, do you mind holding
the 10th of December open for me?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.711
That's three months away.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.088
I don't know what l'm doing next week.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.966
We started a major new pour today.
Oh, cheers.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.468
It's our wedding anniversary, Henry.
December 10th?

14:47.636 --> 14:50.763
Henry isn't interested
in anything that doesn't tie in to his work.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.640
I know that you are very busy...

14:52.808 --> 14:55.393
...but l would very much like
for you to be there.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.146
Of course, Lillian. I'll be there.
Thank you, dear.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.898
I want it to be special.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.983
Everyone will be there.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.693
REARDEN:
Have you had any dinner, Henry?

15:03.861 --> 15:06.779
No, I was busy working,
but I'm not hungry anyway.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.574
That's the trouble with you.
You work too hard.

15:11.702 --> 15:12.827
Mm.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.415
Ooh. What is this?

15:17.583 --> 15:21.794
I had it made
from the first pour of Rearden Metal.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.842
You're giving me a railroad spike?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.513
It's wonderful. It is.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.849
It's original.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.603
I'll be the toast of the town
wearing a piece of the same metal...

15:38.771 --> 15:43.733
...used to build railroads and bridges
and sewer pipes and oil tanks and--

15:43.901 --> 15:45.109
You are so selfish, Henry.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.654
Oh. Phillip, it is not the gift,
it's the intention.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.531
The intention's pure selfishness,
it seems to me.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.035
I mean, another man would have given
his wife a diamond bracelet...

15:54.203 --> 15:57.205
...if he wanted to give her a gift
for her pleasure, not his.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.957
No. The, uh, chain is appropriate.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.669

by which he holds us all in bondage.

I'll authorize a hundred grand for you.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.924
No, Phillip, I don't,
but it will make you happy.

to my account?

16:58.767 --> 17:00.101

17:00.269 --> 17:02.270
Well, the thing is
it's a progressive group.

on a check.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.983

17:08.152 --> 17:11.945
No, it would embarrass us
to have you on the list of our contributors.

that money.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.421
Well, you're not very popular, Hank.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.923
I haven't had any complaints
from my customers.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.593
Yeah? That's not what l mean.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.219
You know what you should do?

17:35.387 --> 17:39.140
You ought to get yourself a good
press agent to sell you to the public.

It's my metal l'm selling. Not me.
Thank you.

But you don't want the public against you.
Public opinion, you know, can mean a lot.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.485
As far as l can tell, it doesn't mean
a damn thing, one way or another.

The press is against you.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.655

you're ruthless.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.971
Well, he's fine, l suppose.
Good.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.891
It's important
that your man in Washington is fine.

What are you trying to imply, Paul?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.066
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.151
No. It's nothing.

lighter than even the cheapest brands...

True.

BOYLE: All right, something has got
to be done about the iron ore shortage.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.496
It threatens
the very existence of the steel industry.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.583

that one company has its own supply.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.251

BOYLE: Exactly.

19:30.419 --> 19:35.089
It's not in the public interest
to let one man destroy an entire industry.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.926

we should do it from the inside.

against Rearden Metal.

Excuse me, I just wanna make sure
that Hank doesn't get hurt.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.482
Paul, it's his own fault.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.735
He's not exactly open to competition.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.494
Well, if he's such a great businessman...

...then why hasn't a single train
filled with ore left Mexico yet?

I think they must be huge.

26:15.323 --> 26:19.118
...and he just up and left.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.619
He couldn't even tell me why.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.329
He just said:

26:23.039 --> 26:24.623
"Who is John Galt?"

26:28.670 --> 26:31.922
Why are so many
great men disappearing?

26:33.341 --> 26:35.301
It's going to be okay, Dagny.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.467
No, I'm not.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.345
What are you selling, pal?

27:19.512 --> 27:24.350
Nothing, I'm simply offering a society

And then we do what?

27:39.240 --> 27:43.410

competition between railroads.

We build public opinion...

27:44.954 --> 27:47.581
...against encroachment
on existing train routes then--

27:47.749 --> 27:50.584
And then the National Alliance of Railroads
proposes a rule.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.711
The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule.

Every member must subordinate...

27:54.506 --> 27:57.383
...his own interests
for the collective needs of the industry.

27:57.550 --> 28:01.762

Dan Conway out of Colorado.

WOMAN [ON TV]: Mexican authorities
seized land throughout the country today.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.071
Most affected
were the San Sebastian Mines...

28:19.239 --> 28:21.657
...where international playboy
Francisco D'Anconia...

28:21.825 --> 28:24.743
...and other investors,
including Taggart Transcontinental...

28:24.911 --> 28:28.122
...and Associated Steel
have reportedly lost billions.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.462
The San Sebastian Line has been seized
by the Mexican government.

28:35.630 --> 28:39.216
It's been nationalized
as Dagny predicted.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.636
An emergency board meeting
has been called.

TAGGART: l can assure you
that there is no need for panic.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.311
And l have full confidence
that our government...

28:51.479 --> 28:54.148
...will negotiate
an equitable settlement with Mexico.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.608
I foresaw the possibility
of this type of event...

28:56.776 --> 29:01.447
...and took every precaution to protect
the interests of Taggart Transcontinental.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.491
Several months ago, l ordered Operations
to cut the schedule...

29:04.659 --> 29:07.661
...on the San Sebastian Line
down to a single train a day...

29:07.829 --> 29:11.081
...and to remove everything of value
from Mexico.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.833
Now, because of my actions...

29:13.001 --> 29:15.836
...billions of company dollars
have been saved.

No, this is no trick.
I checked it all out, Jimmy.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.847
D'Anconia used his own cash
and now he has lost it all in those mines.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.517
He is too smart for that.
He must have something up his sleeve.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.645
Well, let's hope so.
What do your friends in Washington think?

29:33.813 --> 29:36.565

a meeting with D'Anconia yet?

29:43.072 --> 29:45.699
RUTH ANNE: I wasn't able to get a meeting.
Why not?

29:45.867 --> 29:49.703
RUTH ANNE: Senor D'Anconia says
that you bore him, Mr. Taggart.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.251
Yeah, okay, yeah.
There's something else, Dagny.

29:56.419 --> 29:59.671
There was a call just now
from the Rio Norte branch in Colorado.

in three months...

54:26.721 --> 54:29.556
...and that it would last for centuries?

54:32.227 --> 54:33.435
Let me check my budget.

54:33.603 --> 54:35.688
I can make it happen.

54:35.855 --> 54:37.481
Now, l'm staying in town tonight.

54:37.649 --> 54:39.984
I was wondering
if you'd like join me for dinner.

54:41.611 --> 54:43.779
I can't.
I have to get back to New York.

54:44.239 --> 54:45.322
But walk with me.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.993
Do you think it can be stopped?

54:49.160 --> 54:51.620
HENRY: This new line or us?
DAGNY: Both.

55:27.574 --> 55:28.741
What's going on, Eddie?

55:29.242 --> 55:30.909
Ben Nealy's quit.

55:31.995 --> 55:34.204
Kellogg, McNamara, now Nealy.

55:34.372 --> 55:36.081
That's not all,
Dagny.

55:36.249 --> 55:38.625
Taggart Transcontinental
stocks have plummeted...

55:38.793 --> 55:42.546
...because the State Science Institute
has denounced Rearden Metal.

55:42.714 --> 55:45.466
Your family's railroad is in real trouble.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.218
Eddie.

55:51.222 --> 55:53.974
I think it's time to stand
on our own.

55:58.063 --> 56:01.065
In order to save my family's business...

56:02.984 --> 56:04.985
...l'm gonna have to abandon it.

56:15.455 --> 56:17.414
SECRETARY:
Good morning, Miss Taggart.

56:27.133 --> 56:29.051
Taggart Transcontinental is done.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.137
What are you talking about?
We're finished.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.223
We can't stop and we can't go on.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.475
In weeks,
our stock won't be trading anymore.

56:36.643 --> 56:39.520
You're paranoid. Orren Boyle has assured
me there is pending--

56:39.687 --> 56:41.063
Here's what we are gonna do.

56:41.231 --> 56:44.024
And, Jim, this is not a proposal.

56:44.192 --> 56:45.818
Just listen and accept.

56:45.985 --> 56:49.363
I'm gonna take a leave
from Taggart Transcontinental.

56:49.531 --> 56:51.323
Start my own company.
You're leaving?

56:51.491 --> 56:54.993
Shut up. You and the board are gonna
transfer the Rio Norte Line over to me.

56:55.161 --> 56:56.412
Our stock will go back up.

56:56.579 --> 56:58.288
I will act as my own contractor.

56:58.456 --> 57:01.583
I will get my own financing
and finish the line on time.

57:01.751 --> 57:05.587
And where are you gonna get financing?
That is not for you to worry about.

57:05.755 --> 57:07.506
Once we see how the rails perform...

57:07.674 --> 57:10.801
...l will transfer the line
back over to Taggart Transcontinental...

57:10.969 --> 57:12.678
...and return to my job.

57:13.346 --> 57:16.390
Okay. And what are you gonna call
this new line of yours, Dagny?

57:16.558 --> 57:19.017
You're not dragging the family name
through this.

57:19.185 --> 57:21.145
I won't allow it.

57:29.154 --> 57:30.779
The John Galt Line.

57:32.449 --> 57:34.199
Now we know
why you've gone off the rails.

57:34.367 --> 57:36.493
That's the name.
It's your disaster.

57:37.203 --> 57:38.662
And what's the plan if you fail?

57:38.830 --> 57:40.038
I go down alone.

57:40.206 --> 57:42.499
Taggart Transcontinental
remains in your control.

57:44.002 --> 57:45.544
Two last things.
What?

57:45.712 --> 57:47.880
First, I'm taking Eddie Willers.
Oh, no, no.

57:48.047 --> 57:49.131
I need him here.
Tough.

57:49.299 --> 57:51.049
You're gonna have to do your own work.

57:51.217 --> 57:53.927
Second, keep your cronies in Washington
off my back.

57:54.095 --> 57:56.889
Make sure I get all my permissions,
grants, authorizations...

57:57.056 --> 58:01.310
...and any other political crap l need from
those sons of bitches, otherwise, no deal.

58:02.270 --> 58:06.482
I'll see what l can do.
And one last warning, brother dear.

58:07.108 --> 58:10.402
I have never done anything
to hurt a living creature in my entire life.

58:11.362 --> 58:14.406
But if you double-cross me in any way...

58:15.658 --> 58:17.784
...l will destroy you.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.336
DAGNY:
The money would mean nothing to you.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.254
You've wasted that on senseless parties.

58:29.422 --> 58:31.673
You've wasted more
in the San Sebastian mines.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.592
I'm afraid I can't. Money's tight.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.053
I've got too many expenses.
Okay.

58:37.263 --> 58:40.390
So, what do you want me to do, Frisco?
Do you want me to beg?

58:40.558 --> 58:41.850
Because now I'm begging.
Ha.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.060
You don't know how.

58:43.228 --> 58:46.647
I thought that you of all people
would understand.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.411
Then is it me that you want?

59:07.794 --> 59:10.295
Don't ask me such a thing, Dagny.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.674
If l ever meant anything to you...

59:13.841 --> 59:15.801
...loan me the money that l need.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.887
I can't.

59:24.811 --> 59:27.563
What is this savior line gonna be called?

59:30.108 --> 59:31.483
The John Galt Line.

59:33.987 --> 59:37.489
What?
Because I am tired of hearing that name.

59:37.657 --> 59:39.825
It means quitting, giving up.

59:39.993 --> 59:43.620
And l am not giving up.
I am not going to quit.

59:43.871 --> 59:45.789
I'm going to win.

59:54.382 --> 59:56.383
MAN:
I'm sorry, Miss Taggart.

59:57.510 --> 59:58.677
So, what do you think?

Just one last thing.

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.061

No.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.401
Okay.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:19.615

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.626
I have some good news.

01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:33.211
Mr. Rearden, Miss Taggart is--

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:35.130
As president of the John Galt Line...

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.675
...l would like to commission
a Rearden Metal bridge for Wyatt Junction.

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:40.886
Excellent. I'll start rolling the metal.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.513
Aren't you curious as to how
I'm able to finance this?

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:45.307
Okay, l'll bite.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:50.145
Ellis Wyatt, Ted Nielsen,
Lawrence Hammond, Kenneth Danagger.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:53.732
I'm not at 100 percent bonds sold yet,
but I am close.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.192
Hmm.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.530
There. l just made up the difference.

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:04.826
I would never ask anyone to take a risk
I wasn't willing to take.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.580
You're a good man, Hank Rearden.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.917
Can l show you something?

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:13.835
GWEN:
Mr. Rearden's office.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.798
No, he's in a meeting.
May I give you his voicemail?

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.091
Thank you.

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:27.057
DAGNY: Looks like an engine.
HENRY: Not like any engine I've ever seen.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.600
Where did you find this?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.812
Remember that motor company
I was telling you about in Wisconsin?

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:34.314
I did a little digging around
and l found these.

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:36.608
DAGNY:
Twentieth Century Motor Corporation.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:38.944
It's a prototype for a new engine.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:42.406
It never went into production.
I'm not even sure the thing works.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:44.116
Well, it's worth a look.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:48.203
Once the John Galt line is complete,
I'd like to look into this further.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.622
Care to help?
GWEN: Let me see what l can do.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:51.832
Absolutely.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:55.585
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Rearden.
There's an urgent call on line two.

01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:58.130
HENRY:
Hank Rearden.

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.466
What?

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:04.136
Find Mouch.

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:05.637
What is it?

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.807
The legislature passed
the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.809
So quickly? How is that even possible?

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.811
I don't know.
You know what this means?

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.813
Nobody can own
more than one company.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.148
We'll fix this.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:19.651
I'll sign away my other companies,
but they are not getting my metal.

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:23.280
What about Wyatt's bridge?

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.949
I gave my word.

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:29.161
It will be done on time and on budget.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.835
This is just a technicality, Hank.
Okay.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.671
I'll always consider the ore mine as yours.
No.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.632
I either own the property or l don't.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.926
You can trust me.

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:47.888
You know you'll always have
as much ore as you need.

01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:49.097
I don't know.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.267
I've never given you any reason
to mistrust me.

01:02:52.685 --> 01:02:53.894
The mine is yours.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.229
If you intend to keep your word,
then keep it.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:59.649
If you wanna give me first call
on the ore produced, fine.

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:02.110
If you intend to double-cross me...

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:05.489
...so be it.

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.201
It's not fair, Hank.

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:10.994
It wasn't me who passed the law.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.720
DAGNY:
That is correct.

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:13.515

will run July 22nd.

MAN: Great news. Thank you, Dagny.
My pleasure, thank you.

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:20.397
Dagny, this is, uh, Mr. Brady, a delegate
from the Union of Locomotive Engineers.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:21.898
You're busy. l'll be brief.

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:24.526
We're not gonna allow you
to run that train.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.111
Get out of here.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:29.865
You do not come and tell me
what you will or will not allow me to do.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.117
What l meant to say
was a committee decided...

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:35.787
...that allowing men to run your train
on that untested metal...

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.956
...would violate their human rights.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:39.666
Are you serious, Mr. Brady?

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.460
You can't force men to go out
and get killed for profit.

01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:43.920
Put that in writing.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:48.383
That you want to stop your men
from working and earning a wage.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.302
Miss Taggart, you don't understand--

01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:52.721
DAGNY:
Oh, no, no, no. l understand perfectly.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.098
You want me to provide the jobs...

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.894
...and you wanna make it impossible
for me to have any jobs to provide.

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:01.229
You can do whatever you want
with your men.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.815
But that train will run
if l have to drive myself.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.318
Because, Mr. Brady,
if that bridge collapses...

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:08.737
...there won't be any railroad left
in existence.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.488
But if it does not collapse...

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:13.325
...no member of your union
will ever get a job...

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:14.993
...on the John Galt Line.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.662
Now are you going to forbid your men
to run that train?

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:19.998
I never used the word forbid.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:24.419
I'm only stating that you cannot force
anyone to take that run.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.422
I would never force a man
to do anything.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.508
I'll ask for volunteers.

01:05:30.676 --> 01:05:32.427
Then it will be my problem, not yours.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.054
I'll advise them to refuse.

01:05:34.221 --> 01:05:36.556

Probably designed to eliminate excess heat
generated during the process.

in place long enough...

to be captured.

01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:02.810
He worked with a man
named William Hastings.

Could you tell me where to find him?

01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:42.516
The secret you're trying to solve,
it's greater...

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:48.605
...and l mean much greater than an engine
that runs on atmospheric electricity.

01:23:54.237 --> 01:23:55.279
Good luck.

Colorado is a rich state.

It's quite unique. It's in a position where
it can help its neighborhood needier states.
