HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF TESTING

COUNTLESS DESIGN ALTERATIONS
HAVE CREATED MASSIVE CHALLENGES

35:17.716 --> 35:20.517

35:20.519 --> 35:21.885
Rogers: BRINGING

35:21.887 --> 35:23.120
REALLY WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE

35:23.122 --> 35:26.356
WITHOUT A VERY REACTIVE
MANUFACTURE PROCESS.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.459
SOME OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES
ARE TO BE ABLE TO TEST

35:29.461 --> 35:31.461
AND ITERATE VERY, VERY QUICKLY,

35:31.463 --> 35:34.531

WHO MIGHT BE DEVELOPING

35:34.533 --> 35:37.667
A SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY
IS VERY BENEFICIAL.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.573
Narrator: IF THE JET SUIT'S TEAM
IS TO KEEP AHEAD OF THE GAME,

35:43.575 --> 35:46.309
THEY NEED A SUPER-FAST

WHEN WORKING ON SOMETHING
AS ADVANCED AND FUTURISTIC

35:49.314 --> 35:52.349

WE NEED A MANUFACTURING PROCESS

36:01.960 --> 36:04.628
IN 1983, AMERICAN CHUCK HULL

36:04.630 --> 36:07.264
CAME UP WITH
STEREOLITHOGRAPHY...

36:09.468 --> 36:12.035
...AN EXTRAORDINARY
LAYERING PROCESS

36:12.037 --> 36:14.204

36:14.206 --> 36:18.308

36:18.310 --> 36:21.878

YOU CAN GET FEEDBACK,
YOU CAN CHANGE IT QUICKLY

LASER SINTERING,

36:42.401 --> 36:45.368
OR S.L.S., AN EFFICIENT PROCESS

36:45.370 --> 36:49.239
USED TO PROTOTYPE
NEW PARTS IN PLASTIC.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.775
WE USED THE NYLON S.L.S. PROCESS

36:51.777 --> 36:53.910
TO TEST-FIT
SOME OF THE ARM MOUNTS,

36:53.912 --> 36:55.845
AND THEN IF WE'RE HAPPY
WITH THE FIT,

36:55.847 --> 36:57.847
THEN WE'LL MOVE OVER
AND BUILD THIS IN METAL,

36:57.849 --> 37:00.317
BECAUSE THE METAL PROCESS
IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE

37:00.319 --> 37:02.752
THAN BUILDING SOMETHING
IN POLYMER.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.588
Narrator: PRINTING IN METAL

37:04.590 --> 37:07.057
INVOLVES
TRAILBLAZING ENGINEERING.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.659

THERE'S A PLUNGER-TYPE MECHANISM
THAT WILL RISE,

37:22.607 --> 37:25.408
AND THIS WILL CAUSE THE POWDER
LEVEL TO RISE AT THE TOP HERE.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.277
THIS MECHANISM,
CALLED THE RECOATER ARM,,

37:27.279 --> 37:30.413
WILL THEN DRAG A LAYER OF POWDER
OVER THE BUILD PLATE.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.383
THIS VERY THIN LAYER WILL THEN
BE SCANNED WITH THE LASER.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.354

37:50.535 --> 37:52.369
Rogers: THE LAYER THICKNESS
DEPENDS ON THE MATERIAL.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.938
THIS CAN RANGE FROM 20 MICRONS
TO 40 MICRONS.

37:54.940 --> 37:59.209
20 MICRONS IS 20,000ths OF
A MILLIMETER THICK.

FINE LAYER OF TITANIUM POWDER

38:02.314 --> 38:05.815
