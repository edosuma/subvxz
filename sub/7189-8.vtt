17:52.654 --> 17:53.822
- I feel better.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.034
- Bring the <i>Hexoren</i> tomorrow.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.952
It has some protection spells
you can try.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.788
- Okay.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.080
- Okay, wait.
Wait. Wait.

18:02.164 --> 18:06.418
Does dropping an AC unit
onto a witch stun it in place?

18:06.502 --> 18:07.127
What?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.962
It works for zombies.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.339
Let's go.

18:13.967 --> 18:19.348
- So everything you say is
the opposite of what you mean?

18:19.431 --> 18:19.723
- No.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.350
[groans]

18:25.103 --> 18:26.897
- That's...

18:26.980 --> 18:29.525
Look, if this
is about you liking Emma,

18:29.608 --> 18:31.443
you can just tell me.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.949
It's okay if you like her.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.117
- I don't.
Really.

18:39.201 --> 18:39.284
[grunts]

18:53.048 --> 18:55.134
- Maybe your subconscious
is making you say

18:55.217 --> 18:56.510
what you really feel,

18:56.593 --> 18:57.803
and you just have to deal
with it.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.680
- I think you're right.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.474
- Hey, hey.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.016
Don't fight it.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.562
Just go with it.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.564
So it's okay
if I ask Emma out?

19:08.647 --> 19:11.275
- Y...

19:11.358 --> 19:13.068
Y...

19:13.151 --> 19:14.570
Yes!

19:14.653 --> 19:15.904
- Thanks, brah.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.197
You're the best!

19:17.281 --> 19:18.407
- Keep saying "brah"
like that.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.117
It makes you sound
super cool.

19:20.200 --> 19:20.325
- I will, brah.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.579
- [sighs]

19:26.665 --> 19:28.667
- Hi, Danny.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.586
- Bye, Maddie.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.004
- Is something wrong?
- No.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.923
And I would tell you
if there was.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.677
- Just curious, are you
still allergic to butterflies?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.887
- No.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.513
- Listen, I wanted to know

19:41.597 --> 19:43.307
if you wanted
to get back together with me.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.516
- [scoffs]

19:44.600 --> 19:46.143
Yes, I'd love to.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.020
- Oh, I knew it!

19:52.190 --> 19:54.318
- And I brought my toolbox

19:54.401 --> 19:57.154
and a spare engine part
from my dad's '66 Mustang,

19:57.237 --> 19:58.780
and I thought
we could pull it apart--

19:58.864 --> 20:01.199
- You brought an engine
to a sleepover?

20:01.283 --> 20:02.242
- Yeah.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.952
So what's it gonna be?

20:04.036 --> 20:07.998
Zombie makeup night
or engine entertainment night?

20:08.081 --> 20:11.585
- Actually, I thought I'd make
a butterfly collage,

20:11.668 --> 20:14.963
and you can make a...

20:15.047 --> 20:17.007
werewolf collage or...

20:17.090 --> 20:17.966
something.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.469
- Hey, werewolf?
Yeah.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.346
Collage?
No.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.641
- Well, then what do you
want to do?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.392
No way.
My dad's right in the kitchen.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.811
- Oh, come on, Em!
What's the point of being

20:29.895 --> 20:32.689
best friends with a witch
if we can't do spells and stuff?

20:32.773 --> 20:35.776
- That's the only reason
why you're my friend?

20:35.859 --> 20:36.526
- No.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.569
There's many reasons.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.530
That's just one
of the best ones.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.532
Now go get that giant book,
and let's spell trouble.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.534
- Okay.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.243
Just one.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.917
- Maybe you could turn me
into a lion,

20:52.000 --> 20:52.709
queen of the jungle!

20:52.793 --> 20:53.710
- Um, Andi?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.754
- No, wait!

20:55.837 --> 20:57.130
A great white shark--
Wait. No.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.423
I'm just gonna flop around
with no water.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.133
- Um, Andi.
- Whoa, wait.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.260
I'll just sit in the bathtub!
- Andi, it's gone!

21:02.344 --> 21:04.638
The <i>Hexoren,</i>
it was right here,

21:04.721 --> 21:06.515
and now it's gone.
- What?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.058
- Who would steal it
right off my--

21:10.477 --> 21:11.728
Maddie.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.566
- Could you hurry up
so we can get our freezin' on?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.902
- Our freezing?
- Yeah.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.237
I bring the stuff,
and you freeze the stuff.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.447
- I just have
to clean back here,

21:22.531 --> 21:28.120
but it's gonna take a long time
if it's just me.

21:28.203 --> 21:28.912
- [sighs]
Okay, fine.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.498
I'll help.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.836
- Thank you!
Come again.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.382
- What?

21:40.465 --> 21:43.010
- I think I drank
too much soda.

21:44.302 --> 21:44.845
[belches]

21:44.928 --> 21:48.557

21:48.640 --> 21:49.891
Mac?

21:52.728 --> 21:55.355
Mac!

21:55.439 --> 21:56.648
Oh, no.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.108
What did I do?

21:58.191 --> 21:59.651
Mac!
