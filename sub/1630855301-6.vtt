WEBVTT

00:18.060 --> 00:19.061
Mommy?

00:23.565 --> 00:25.234
My tummy hurts.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.570
- Mommy?
- Huh?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.782
- What time is it?
- I don't want to go to school.

00:31.782 --> 00:32.866
Oh, shit.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.285
Shit.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.956
Ezra, go.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.874
You need to get dressed
and get some breakfast in you

00:40.874 --> 00:43.043
before Grandma gets here, okay?
Mama has class.

00:43.627 --> 00:44.628
Shit.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.176
Why aren't you dressed?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.055
- What are you eating?
- Hi.

00:55.681 --> 00:56.932
Morning.

00:56.932 --> 01:00.602
You can't believe the train today.
Where are all these people going?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.230
Hey. What's going on?

01:03.939 --> 01:05.357
Why isn't he dressed?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.568
What is he eating?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.570
- My tummy hurts.
- Oh, baby.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.697
No, don't "oh, baby" him, Mom.
He needs to get dressed.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.031
He needs to go to school.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.491
- It's psychosomatic.
- My tummy--

01:14.491 --> 01:16.285
Well, it's not like he doesn't have
a good reason.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.786
Don't you dare start with me this morning.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.246
Do not go talking to me like that.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.497
I don't wanna go!

01:21.456 --> 01:22.875
Goddamn it, Ezra!

01:23.917 --> 01:25.002
What are you doing?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.420
Who do you think you are?

01:26.420 --> 01:27.880
I want my daddy.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.048
I've got you. Granny's here, honey.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.341
Go to work.

01:31.341 --> 01:35.179
- It's all right, sweetheart. It's okay.
- All right.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.972
It's all right, honey. Granny's here.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.600
- He has to go to school.
- I'll bring him. Don't be late again.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.062
Hey, honey. Wanna give me a hug?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.549
Dr. Goodwin!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.385
Dean Hughs. I didn't see you there.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.596
I feel as if you've been avoiding me

02:17.596 --> 02:19.431
ever since we failed
to support your grant.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.644
Rya, you're a great teacher.
If any one of you deserves tenure--

02:23.644 --> 02:25.979
Any one of us? A woman, you mean?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.065
Well, that's not what I mean,

02:28.065 --> 02:30.609
but since we're still technically
a men's university--

02:30.609 --> 02:34.404
Women can't teach men?
I'm pretty sure that's mostly what we do.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.324
Fair, but in this matter,
you are running behind.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.244
Anorexia has already been included
in the DSM.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.453
One form of it.

02:41.453 --> 02:45.582
- All right, we've been over this.
- Anorexia is not just a single disorder.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.168
Bulimia has its very own
unique condition--

02:48.168 --> 02:49.711
I know you are passionate about this

02:49.711 --> 02:52.548
but Sam Wilkes has also applied
for a grant

02:52.548 --> 02:54.633
which is essentially splitting hairs,
and he's got--

02:54.633 --> 02:56.385
- Testicles.
- Seniority.

02:57.219 --> 03:01.431
I'm very sorry, Rya, but if you want
the department to support your grant,

03:01.431 --> 03:04.184
you're going to have to find
something else. Okay?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.645
It seems we're both late to class.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.900
<i>Trauma is the closest thing
we have to time travel.</i>

03:12.734 --> 03:15.445
The moment of trauma
is imprinted on our minds,

03:15.445 --> 03:17.197
indelible ink on paper.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.993
But unlike ink,
trauma doesn't fade over time.

03:20.993 --> 03:25.163
When activated by an event
or a sense or memory,

03:25.706 --> 03:30.586
the sufferer is transported back
to the very moment of psychic injury.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.339
Imagine the army medic
who comes upon a village massacre.

03:34.339 --> 03:38.802
All around him are the screams
of orphaned children,

03:38.802 --> 03:40.179
the smell of burning bodies.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.264
The experience is overwhelming.

03:43.015 --> 03:46.143
He must escape,
but he can't because he has a job to do.

03:46.852 --> 03:51.064
This dialectic causes a dissociation
from reality.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.359
But psychic flight has a cost.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.989
Memory remains,
like rot beneath the bark of a tree.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.742
Our medic has now returned home.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.995
He tries not to think about that village
as he goes about his daily life.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.497
He attends a neighborhood barbecue.

04:07.497 --> 04:11.752
But local children's play
now sounds like death screams.

04:12.336 --> 04:16.673
The meat on the grill is indistinguishable
from burning bodies.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.091
He can't stay.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.928
His trauma has made
the barbecue intolerable.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.473
And over time,

04:24.973 --> 04:29.561
it will invade all of his experiences
until his world becomes unlivable.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.776
Remember, most trauma sufferers
are reexperiencing

04:35.776 --> 04:37.569
real events that we cannot see.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.656
What we call disorder is, for them,

04:40.656 --> 04:44.368
a very reasonable way
of escaping actual horror.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.911
To put it bluntly,

04:46.954 --> 04:49.623
they would be crazy not to be crazy.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.336
Thank you, everybody.
I'll see you next week.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.760
Criminal Psychology is down the hall, Detective.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.845
It's more your speed.

05:02.845 --> 05:06.223
Well, word on the street is
you're the best academia has to offer, so,

05:06.223 --> 05:09.434
I don't know, thought I'd come by
and see what all the fuss was about.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.026
Matty, I'm flattered. I really am.
I had a good time.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.779
But I meant what I said.
I'm going through a divorce.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.698
- I can't be in anything serious right now.
- Whoa, whoa.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.325
Easy there, tiger.
That's not why I'm here.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.952
Trust me. I can take no for an answer,

05:26.952 --> 05:29.162
even though you're obviously
making a huge mistake.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.540
Well, mistakes are my forte, so...

05:31.540 --> 05:33.458
Just wanted to bring you this.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.043
We brought in a kid last night.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.045
Multiple counts of attempted homicide.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.131
There might be something in there
that interests you.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.341
That's why you came here?

05:42.384 --> 05:43.969
Yeah. What?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.264
You think I'd do all this
just to get back in bed with you?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.516
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.560
Okay, well, that's a fair point.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.688
But you said that you needed
a real wacko for a case study

05:54.688 --> 05:57.816
- or else you were gonna lose your job.
- Is that what you heard?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.193
I was a little bit distracted.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.946
Look. Hey, we got a real psycho here.

08:06.778 --> 08:10.157
<i>There's bullets flying,
glass everywhere, winged one guy.</i>

08:10.157 --> 08:11.992
This lady took one in the leg.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.620
Kid's just a little good luck shy
of a murder charge.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.372
Wait, I read this in the paper last week.
I thought the shooter went missing.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.832
Well, we got him.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.128
- There's no history here.
- Well, there's no prints in the system.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.214
And he won't give up his last name.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.423
Says it wouldn't serve.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.800
It's not good for the cause.
Can you believe that?

08:29.760 --> 08:32.011
We had some shitty blow-up of his face
going around.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.804
Someone spotted him getting a cab at JFK.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.017
Took him to a run-down
boardinghouse upstate.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.770
Elm Road in Elm Ridge.
Can't make that shit up.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.857
And ConEd says that all the bills
are in some Israeli guy's name.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.818
They're always mailed in cash.
There's no sign of him.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.155
What about the girl, Ariana?
That's a pretty name.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.406
There's no sign of her either.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.201
I'm thinking that he offed her
and the landlord.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.495
- Well, we know he's happy with a gun.
- Why?

08:57.996 --> 09:00.082
You gotta meet him. You'll see.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.502
The kid is weird, sure. But, you know,
maybe he's just high as a kite.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.088
- No. There's something in his eyes.
- Now who's the crazy one?

09:06.088 --> 09:09.341
No, it's in the way he talked
in the interview. His diction.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.385
- His word choice.
- His word choice?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.971
Lady,
you must be a true cyclone in the sack.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.642
Look, he goes where he can get
the most attention.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.104
He changes the way he talks.
He doesn't show any remorse.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.564
That's what a psycho does.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.775
This is what happens when your partner
reads one book on serial killers.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.945
So, come on, what do you think? Is he one?

09:29.945 --> 09:31.196
It's not that simple.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.283
There are a number of dispositive factors
that I'm not seeing.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.326
And the nature of the crime
is inconsistent with his--

09:36.326 --> 09:37.703
Or crimes.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.873
There's blood on the floor of the house.
There's signs of a struggle,

09:40.873 --> 09:43.000
- and there's a bullet hole in the glass.
- Circumstantial.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.545
Yeah, but what if he is?
What if we caught one?

09:46.545 --> 09:50.340
Did he tell you what he was doing
firing a gun at Rockefeller Center?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.926
Yeah, he said him
and the girl wanted to scare someone.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.138
- Who?
- Won't say. Says, "It wouldn't serve."

09:56.930 --> 09:57.764
Huh.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.728
So, what do you think?
This is what you do, Professor.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.190
- Let me take a look.
- Yeah?

10:06.190 --> 10:07.482
Why not?

10:22.497 --> 10:23.624
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.541
Okay.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.130
Whoa. What up, sis?

10:31.215 --> 10:34.343
Hello, Danny. I'm Dr. Goodwin,
but you can call me Rya.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.305
To what do I owe the pleasure?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.182
Sit up.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.725
Hands.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.230
- Whoa.
- Okay. Hey, hey. Hey, relax.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.239
Be right outside.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.452
How are you?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.457
What are we doing here today, ma'am?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.377
Why the cuffs? I hate cuffs.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.711
Do you know why you're here?

11:11.922 --> 11:12.965
Do you?

11:14.716 --> 11:16.134
Let's start with something simpler.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.012
Why don't you tell me your last name?

11:20.597 --> 11:23.225
I don't think any of this
is what Jack had in mind.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.393
Who's Jack?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.606
I give up. Who's Jack?

11:31.984 --> 11:34.403
Danny, if you talk to me,
I might be able to help you.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.907
Wait, you can get me out of here?
I don't much like being locked up.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.992
I get it.

11:41.326 --> 11:45.038
I shouldn't really be in here anyway.
Ariana was the one that did the shooting.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.123
Ariana?

11:46.623 --> 11:49.585
Where is Ariana?
Because the cops can't seem to find her.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.752
They won't find her either.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.505
Why is that?

11:54.006 --> 11:56.717
I'm starting to think that
you're not actually here to help me.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.344
How can I help you, Danny?

11:59.928 --> 12:00.929
Get me out of here.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.185
Can I tell you a secret?

12:08.353 --> 12:09.188
Sure.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.357
I can get myself out.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.402
Matty!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.404
- Whoa, whoa! It's a joke.
- What the fuck?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.365
- Oh, shit. Okay, whoa, whoa.
- What the fuck?

12:20.365 --> 12:22.409
All right. Hands behind your back, kid.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.494
A little heavy-handed,
don't you think, Frank?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.456
Hey, Doc. Absolute pleasure.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.666
I'll be seeing ya.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.919
Just keep it moving. Shut up.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.129
Let's go.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.298
<i>Sorry about those cuffs.
They must've been faulty.</i>

12:36.298 --> 12:37.758
It startled me, is all.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.010
He wasn't anything like that
in the interview, I swear.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.054
He said something
about somebody named Jack.

12:42.054 --> 12:45.474
Yeah. In the interview, too.
"Jack says it's time to face the music,"

12:45.474 --> 12:47.684
or something. I ask him,
"Who's Jack?" He just clams right up.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.311
- Same.
- Yeah.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.774
He's playing us.
I mean, they can do that, right?

12:53.774 --> 12:55.567
He's magnetic for sure.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.653
That could be a sign of psychosis.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.988
He's erratic. A little bit spooky.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.782
But I still think Frank might be right.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.744
No. Oh, my God. How I hate those words.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.374
Maybe he just needs to detox.
Give him a few days to come down.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.709
You'll have a better idea
of what you've got.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.002
Not for you, huh?

13:14.002 --> 13:16.421
Matty,
I appreciate you trying to help me. I do.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.049
Appreciate it enough to have dinner?

13:19.049 --> 13:20.843
- No.
- Okay.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.804
Well, if you change your mind,
you know, about the kid--

13:23.804 --> 13:24.888
Yep.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.975
- Thanks, Matty. I'll see you around.
- Sure. Yeah, yeah.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.481
I'm sorry.

13:36.275 --> 13:39.152
A little late is not two and a half hours.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.487
Yeah. I said I'm sorry.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.197
Me? It doesn't matter.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.784
Him? A little consistency, maybe.
Does it occur?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.578
Sit down to a meal together?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.249
It's cold.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.127
Could you grab some wine from the fridge--

13:55.127 --> 13:56.253
You don't need wine.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.512
It's good.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.020
He talked to his father.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.112
- Goddamn it, Mom. It's not his night.
- Don't use that tone with me, young lady.

14:22.112 --> 14:26.658
You weren't here.
He wanted to talk to him, so I let him.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.452
I have to be able to do this without him.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.537
Then be here to do it, Rya.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.402
I get that he's angry.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.404
I do.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.450
But he won't talk to me.
He won't kiss me good night.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.494
He used to sleep between us in our bed.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.829
And when I hear him crying,

15:12.829 --> 15:15.290
I'll go to him and he won't even
come back with me.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.126
So what am I supposed to do?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.173
What we all do, I guess.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.258
What's that?

15:26.051 --> 15:28.720
Keep loving you
no matter how hard you make it.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.306
Is there a choice?

15:35.060 --> 15:36.436
You should've been the shrink, Mom.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.230
I know.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.751
<i>What's going on with tenure?</i>

16:41.585 --> 16:43.128
Martin said
your grant proposal was rejected.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.964
Why are you talking to Martin
about my grant?

16:45.964 --> 16:47.716
I was head of the department. We talk.

16:47.716 --> 16:48.842
Jesus, Greg.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.344
Rya, listen to me.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.222
You're a hell of an intuitive therapist.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.683
One of the best I've ever seen.
And I've seen a bunch.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.854
But your obsession with clinical outliers
is going to kill your career.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.357
Not everything has to be
a novel diagnosis.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.234
Please don't lecture me.
We are not in class anymore, Greg.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.653
Do something mainstream.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.155
Tell Martin you want to focus on
behavior mod.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.240
Behavior mod?

17:11.240 --> 17:13.367
Or learning theory. There's money there.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.244
- I could talk to him.
- Literally over my cold, dead body.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.209
Has it occurred to you
that this desire to distinguish yourself

17:22.209 --> 17:24.545
by validating the most extreme cases

17:24.545 --> 17:26.964
stems from your own insecurities

17:26.964 --> 17:30.175
rather than a sincere desire
to help the patient?

17:30.175 --> 17:31.468
How are they incompatible?

17:31.468 --> 17:34.263
What, you don't want to be
heralded for the work that you do?

17:34.263 --> 17:37.432
Or is enlightened self-interest
just a man's prerogative?

17:37.432 --> 17:39.268
You've been reading too much <i>Ms. Magazine</i>.

17:39.268 --> 17:42.521
I think that's another way of you
not wanting to tell me that I'm right.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.443
No, better with the horseradish.

17:49.611 --> 17:53.198
Oof! You can quote
a 20-year-old medical journal,

17:53.198 --> 17:55.909
but you cannot remember
that I'm allergic to horseradish?

17:55.909 --> 17:58.662
Not liking and being allergic?
Two different things.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.581
And another?

18:00.581 --> 18:04.626
A gin martini for me and a vodka tonic
with a lime and two maraschino cherries.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.380
I do remember some things.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.595
Please don't call him
when it's not your night.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.472
He called me.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.474
Technically your mother called me
and put him on the phone.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.435
Nevertheless, I'm what he's got now,

18:21.435 --> 18:24.104
and he's gonna have to make do
with that despite my shortcomings.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.024
Rya, that's not very therapeutic.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.901
Well, I'm not his therapist,
I'm his mother.

18:30.194 --> 18:33.572
And when it comes to shortcomings, God
knows we've all had to deal with yours.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.162
You know, Rya, it's challenging with you.

18:41.455 --> 18:45.250
So hot and cold in so many ways.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.421
Never know who you're gonna get.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.514
Fuck.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.145
What if I present a case
where I can prove the diagnosis is real?

19:47.688 --> 19:49.898
Why look for the most
obscure conditions possible?

19:49.898 --> 19:51.942
Jesus, Martin! That's the whole point.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.443
It's because they're obscure.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.487
No one helps them
because they're told that

19:55.487 --> 19:57.322
what they're going through isn't real

19:57.322 --> 19:58.824
and what they're feeling doesn't matter,

19:58.824 --> 20:01.660
because there's no diagnostic code
for them in this book.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.704
Rya, you don't have anything to prove.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.080
Please don't be condescending.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.250
I have at least 15 more years
of my son's tuition to take care of.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.460
I need tenure.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.338
And you and I both know that
I'm not gonna get it

20:13.338 --> 20:15.048
unless I publish another article.

20:15.591 --> 20:19.720
If I show veracity of the diagnosis,
will the department support a grant?

20:19.720 --> 20:24.016
If you verify the diagnosis,
yes, I will support the grant.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.644
Hell, I will support a dedicated chair
with your name on it.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.895
<i>This is WABC AM 770.</i>

21:09.895 --> 21:12.105
<i>Coming from the White House
with a special report.</i>

21:12.105 --> 21:14.024
<i>It's a simple matter of common sense</i>

21:14.024 --> 21:17.778
<i>for us to do everything we possibly can
to reduce our vulnerability.</i>

21:18.445 --> 21:20.280
<i>We must be prepared for the worst.</i>

21:20.864 --> 21:26.036
<i>We must make certain that gasoline
can be distributed promptly and fairly</i>

21:26.036 --> 21:27.829
<i>in case of an emergency.</i>

21:46.640 --> 21:47.766
Hello?

21:52.771 --> 21:53.772
Hello?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.459
Do you know where Danny is?

23:00.172 --> 23:01.298
You know Danny?

23:02.341 --> 23:03.425
He's my son.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.260
Is something wrong?

23:06.011 --> 23:07.262
Did something happen to him?

23:08.889 --> 23:10.641
Is there somewhere where we could talk?

23:12.559 --> 23:15.979
- Yeah, that's him.
- How can he be in jail?

23:17.272 --> 23:18.482
Was Danny a twin?

23:22.861 --> 23:24.029
That's Adam.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.740
He's been gone a long time.

23:29.618 --> 23:30.744
What happened to him?

23:34.581 --> 23:36.083
A psychologist, you said?

23:37.835 --> 23:39.628
- Trying to help him out?
- Yeah, I'd like to.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.090
Let's sit outside.

23:43.966 --> 23:44.967
Thank you.

23:45.968 --> 23:50.264
Even before everything with Adam,

23:51.640 --> 23:53.016
he was very sensitive.

23:54.810 --> 23:56.895
And then they kicked him out of school.

23:56.895 --> 23:57.980
Why?

24:01.066 --> 24:01.984
Drugs and fighting.

24:01.984 --> 24:03.235
There were both.

24:04.152 --> 24:07.072
You know, he was always so bright.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.367
He was like a light, that kid.

24:10.993 --> 24:12.536
And the imagination.

24:14.830 --> 24:18.041
But things just didn't turn out.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.085
Me and men.

24:20.586 --> 24:21.587
That's all.

24:22.588 --> 24:25.841
May I ask how he ended up
living across the street?

24:26.425 --> 24:29.344
Him and my husband,
they didn't see eye to eye.

24:29.344 --> 24:32.306
But my husband doesn't see eye to eye
with much of anyone.

24:32.306 --> 24:34.474
So he moved in there a couple years ago.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.810
And I figured, "What's the harm," right?

24:37.394 --> 24:39.021
Least I can keep an eye on him.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.274
And then one day he's just gone.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.444
But attempted murder?

24:50.157 --> 24:51.575
That's not my Danny.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.954
Do you know
who lived with him across the street?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.585
I don't know who was full-time.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.087
There was a girl there a lot.
People come and go.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.797
So what? Is he going to prison?

25:06.757 --> 25:08.008
I hope not.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.094
Candy, you said he was sensitive.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.430
Would you say that
he was moody as a child?

25:14.097 --> 25:16.725
Depressed? Quick to react?

25:17.309 --> 25:21.021
Did his moodiness increase around
everything that happened with Adam?

25:23.524 --> 25:27.402
Like I said, he was always different.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.948
No crime in that.

25:30.948 --> 25:32.950
No, there isn't. No.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.163
I'd like to ask you something.

25:39.248 --> 25:42.668
It's a difficult question, but I think
it'd be very helpful in helping him.

25:43.418 --> 25:46.380
Did anything ever happen to Danny
as a boy?

25:47.464 --> 25:48.632
What kind of thing?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.387
When you mentioned that
you don't have much luck with men,

25:53.387 --> 25:56.557
- what did you mean by that?
- It's my fucking fault now?

25:56.557 --> 25:59.726
- No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
- What did he say happened?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.228
Nothing.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.898
I'm just trying to better understand him.

26:08.861 --> 26:10.112
I don't know what people do.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.240
You know what everybody does?
All the people who come to see you?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.325
- No.
- No, 'cause people do things

26:15.325 --> 26:17.160
they don't look like they're capable of.

26:19.538 --> 26:20.581
Candy--

26:20.581 --> 26:23.208
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late for work,
to the hospital.

26:25.794 --> 26:28.046
Tell him I'm gonna come see him.

26:28.964 --> 26:31.508
- Candy, I'm not even his doctor yet.
- Just leave your cup.

26:45.981 --> 26:48.066
Ezra, it's ten o'clock.
You need to go to bed.

27:27.314 --> 27:30.108
- I need to talk to Danny again.
- You can't.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.945
He's been processed already.
He's on his way to Rikers this afternoon.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.947
Legal Aid says he gets no visitors
until he gets there.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.741
- I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
- Dinner tonight, no sex.

27:37.741 --> 27:38.825
I need to see him.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.747
You are a piece of work.
All right. Come on.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.047
Hello again.

27:54.675 --> 27:55.759
You remember me?

27:57.344 --> 27:58.929
Face like that, who'd forget?

28:00.931 --> 28:02.933
You mentioned someone named Jack
the other day.

28:03.684 --> 28:06.478
- Yeah, what about him?
- I was wondering if I could talk to him.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.982
Do you think you could
give him a message from me?

28:11.108 --> 28:12.109
How?

28:12.109 --> 28:14.903
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I'm locked up in jail here.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.780
I just thought that maybe you can.

28:19.533 --> 28:20.534
Say you can.

28:22.286 --> 28:23.495
Say I can...

28:25.747 --> 28:26.748
hypothetically.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.209
If you can--

28:30.043 --> 28:32.171
Could you tell him
that I just wanna talk to him?

28:32.171 --> 28:33.255
- Yeah.
- I just wanna help.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.464
Sure. Done.

28:36.925 --> 28:38.594
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:43.265 --> 28:45.100
Hey, they say I'm going to Rikers Island.

28:46.977 --> 28:48.228
Is it really that bad?

28:49.730 --> 28:50.939
Not too bad.

28:52.274 --> 28:55.068
It looks like you think it's pretty bad.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.821
Anyway, thanks for coming to see me.

28:58.697 --> 28:59.698
Of course.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.503
This is not a date.

29:13.378 --> 29:16.131
Yeah. "Bring a pepperoni
and sausage pizza to my house,

29:16.131 --> 29:18.884
because my kid's upstairs asleep,"
didn't exactly scream romance.

29:18.884 --> 29:20.427
Did you get extra cheese?

29:24.306 --> 29:26.725
I went to that old boardinghouse
where he was living.

29:27.226 --> 29:29.269
- Define "went to."
- Went into.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.105
Did somebody let you in at least?

29:32.105 --> 29:33.857
The door was unlocked. Does that help?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.944
- No. That's breaking and entering.
- Oops.

29:36.944 --> 29:38.487
How did you even find that place?

29:38.487 --> 29:41.740
The boardinghouse was on Elm Road
in Elm Ridge, remember?

29:41.740 --> 29:45.577
- Hey, hey. What are you doing, Rya?
- I found his mother.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.579
I'm sorry?

29:48.163 --> 29:50.958
His name is Danny Sullivan,
and that's her address.

29:54.545 --> 29:57.005
I also found this in the fireplace.

30:02.302 --> 30:05.180
Do you recognize her?

30:06.473 --> 30:10.519
That's the girl from Rockefeller Center.
At least if the description is accurate.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.025
Do you think--

30:18.819 --> 30:20.654
Do you think these are all victims?

30:20.654 --> 30:21.864
Maybe.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.617
But not this guy.

30:26.118 --> 30:28.996
The style of this drawing is disorganized.

30:28.996 --> 30:32.833
And this image is repeated
throughout this book again and again.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.626
Okay, who am I looking at here?

30:34.626 --> 30:36.920
Well, that's Big Ben--
That tower behind him.

30:36.920 --> 30:37.838
Right.

30:37.838 --> 30:40.215
These glasses are just like the ones
I found in the house.

30:40.215 --> 30:42.259
You didn't happen to steal those too,
did you?

30:42.259 --> 30:43.719
Maybe that's Jack.

30:45.137 --> 30:46.513
Jack? Jack.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.142
The one who told the kid
not to give his name.

30:50.142 --> 30:53.228
- That it wouldn't serve.
- Right. So what?

30:53.228 --> 30:55.564
You think this guy's an accomplice?

30:55.564 --> 30:58.233
Well, you said that Danny's diction
and his speech pattern

30:58.233 --> 31:00.277
was different the first time
you interviewed him.

31:00.277 --> 31:01.445
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:01.445 --> 31:03.405
Would you say that he had
an English accent?

31:04.406 --> 31:06.241
Not all the way through.

31:06.241 --> 31:08.744
But, yeah, sometimes, actually,
now that you mention it.

31:09.411 --> 31:10.412
What if...

31:12.247 --> 31:14.249
Danny is Jack?

31:15.626 --> 31:16.877
Excuse me?

31:16.877 --> 31:20.339
What if Danny has a split personality?

31:20.923 --> 31:21.924
Come on.

31:21.924 --> 31:24.343
Matty, you were right about Danny.

31:24.927 --> 31:27.179
Something about him just stays with me.

31:27.679 --> 31:30.015
His affect was labile and fluid.

31:30.015 --> 31:34.269
Call it a clinical intuition or a hunch,
but something's off about him.

31:35.020 --> 31:39.066
What if Danny has another personality
named Jack?

31:40.943 --> 31:42.653
One who maybe does things for him.

31:42.653 --> 31:44.905
He does things for him? Like kill people?

31:44.905 --> 31:45.948
I'm sorry.

31:45.948 --> 31:47.908
Like, maybe, kill a lot of people?

31:47.908 --> 31:50.494
Maybe he's unaware of his actions
when he's Jack.

31:51.078 --> 31:53.080
Or he thinks somebody else is doing them.

31:55.165 --> 31:57.209
- You're serious.
- Matty, if I'm right,

31:57.918 --> 31:59.127
Danny may be innocent.

32:01.129 --> 32:02.589
How the hell does that work exactly?

32:02.589 --> 32:04.633
Because it's his other personality
who's the criminal.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.593
Right. Good luck telling that to a jury.

32:07.970 --> 32:09.137
- Okay.
- Or--

32:10.222 --> 32:11.348
Or your tenure committee.

32:11.348 --> 32:13.475
That would be a validation
of the condition, yes.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.185
And you get a big, fat grant.

32:15.185 --> 32:16.603
And I'd help a lot of people.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.731
Okay, okay. Look. Just say--

32:20.649 --> 32:25.946
Say he's got
the split personality thing.

32:27.155 --> 32:28.240
What then?

32:28.240 --> 32:31.118
Well, the first person
you'd have to convince is him.

32:32.703 --> 32:36.206
And if he's not aware of his condition,
and somebody tells him before he's ready,

32:36.206 --> 32:37.875
he's likely to have a breakdown.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.252
So he needs to trust somebody first.

32:40.252 --> 32:41.336
Trust?

32:42.754 --> 32:43.922
It's as simple as that?

32:44.756 --> 32:46.925
No. And also, yes.

32:47.676 --> 32:49.219
And that person is gonna be you?

32:49.219 --> 32:50.637
That person's gonna be me.

32:52.598 --> 32:54.141
And how are you gonna do that exactly?

32:54.141 --> 32:56.852
You're gonna give me the name
of his Legal Aid lawyer,

32:56.852 --> 32:59.021
and I'm gonna go and try to talk to Jack.

33:23.337 --> 33:24.505
Hi, Stan Camisa?

33:24.505 --> 33:26.548
No, not today, okay? Docket's full.

33:26.548 --> 33:29.426
I'm here about Danny Sullivan,
the Rockefeller Center shooter?

33:32.554 --> 33:34.473
- What about him?
- My name is Rya Goodwin.

33:34.473 --> 33:35.724
I'm a psychologist.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.893
Detective Doyle
brought me in on a consult,

33:37.893 --> 33:41.146
and I believe that your client
is suffering from a rare mental disorder.

33:41.146 --> 33:42.648
Yeah. That kid's a wack job.

33:42.648 --> 33:45.567
You know...

33:45.567 --> 33:48.362
- ...those terms aren't very helpful.
- Forgive me.

33:49.029 --> 33:50.155
Having met with Danny,

33:50.155 --> 33:54.159
it is my professional opinion
that he has a split personality.

33:54.743 --> 33:55.744
Wait.

33:57.329 --> 33:58.789
That's the Sally Field thing?

33:58.789 --> 33:59.790
<i>Sybil</i>?

33:59.790 --> 34:02.209
Yeah, it's about a woman
with the same condition.

34:02.209 --> 34:03.418
You're kidding, right?

34:04.670 --> 34:05.671
Is this a gag?

34:07.756 --> 34:08.924
What? You want one?

34:09.800 --> 34:11.760
Mr. Camisa, your client is sick

34:11.760 --> 34:13.846
and he needs to be in a hospital,
not a jail.

34:13.846 --> 34:16.223
- What do you want me to do about it?
- You're his lawyer.

34:16.764 --> 34:17.850
Same question.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.685
Isn't it your job to help your client?

34:21.436 --> 34:25.690
My job is to act
in the client's best interest.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.359
And when they are surrounded by witnesses

34:27.359 --> 34:30.571
while committing the actual crime,
their best interest is to plead guilty.

34:31.196 --> 34:34.283
- Can't you just argue that he's sick?
- They send people to jail with cancer.

34:34.283 --> 34:36.909
You think they're gonna let this kid off
because he talks in funny voices?

34:37.578 --> 34:39.036
Yeah, I read his case file.

34:39.955 --> 34:41.623
You know, it being my job and all.

34:41.623 --> 34:43.500
Do you know where
this condition comes from?

34:44.001 --> 34:45.835
The funny papers, maybe.

34:46.378 --> 34:49.380
Multiple personality results almost solely

34:50.382 --> 34:53.510
from extreme, often ongoing,
sexual abuse in early childhood.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.141
I've met this kid. Whatever you do
or do not believe about him,

34:59.141 --> 35:01.768
I can tell you one thing,
he's not gonna last five minutes upstate.

35:02.269 --> 35:04.605
It's a dice roll he even
makes it through Rikers alive.

35:04.605 --> 35:06.231
Maybe I find out that he is sick,

35:06.732 --> 35:09.484
maybe I just get a sob story
that you can plead his case on.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.528
But I do need to talk to him, okay?

35:11.528 --> 35:14.072
I need a few sessions with him.
You can make that happen.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.743
Or you can let me walk out of here
right now, and...

35:19.411 --> 35:22.915
one day very soon you will wake up
with this kid's blood all over your hands,

35:22.915 --> 35:25.042
and you can drip that
in your fucking egg salad.

35:27.336 --> 35:28.337
Wow.

35:31.298 --> 35:32.382
You married?

35:32.966 --> 35:33.967
Divorced.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.527
Okay.

35:51.527 --> 35:54.655
If you make my life harder
in even the smallest way, we're done.

35:55.239 --> 35:56.865
His hearing's in about a month.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.451
Xerox in the back.
It takes quarters.

36:25.686 --> 36:26.687
Thank you.

36:59.761 --> 37:01.388
You can take the cuffs off, please.

37:05.684 --> 37:06.768
Hello.

37:12.524 --> 37:13.901
Would you like to sit down?

37:18.030 --> 37:19.615
I brought you some new clothes.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.413
Fresh air.

37:27.956 --> 37:31.043
It's been a few days
since I've had some fresh air.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.797
How are you feeling today?

37:36.757 --> 37:37.758
Quite well.

37:39.510 --> 37:41.720
Although I don't think
you're that kind of doctor.

37:42.930 --> 37:44.389
Are you, Doctor?

37:44.389 --> 37:46.850
Show me a sane man,
and I will cure him for you.

37:49.436 --> 37:50.437
Carl Jung.

37:52.397 --> 37:54.024
I always preferred him to Freud.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.904
I didn't notice your accent
last time we spoke.

38:00.197 --> 38:01.198
Are you English?

38:01.782 --> 38:04.201
I like to consider myself
a citizen of the world.

38:05.661 --> 38:07.996
I was hoping to get
a better sense of the case.

38:08.830 --> 38:11.250
Biographical details. Family history.

38:13.919 --> 38:16.588
Don't you find all of that

38:16.588 --> 38:19.174
"tell me about your childhood"
nonsense rather tedious?

38:19.174 --> 38:21.468
I know that I do. No offense.

38:22.928 --> 38:25.848
None taken. I just thought
that it might help the defense

38:25.848 --> 38:28.934
give context to what happened in Midtown.

38:30.435 --> 38:32.855
Well, the two of them
are just misguided children.

38:33.438 --> 38:35.232
And no one was seriously hurt, correct?

38:35.774 --> 38:39.361
The two of them?
Obviously you're very smart,

38:39.361 --> 38:44.116
so I can only assume that you
wanted me to catch that.

38:48.161 --> 38:49.329
You're not Danny, are you?

38:52.249 --> 38:55.335
Are you sure we're not
on the wrong sides of the desk, Doctor?

38:57.880 --> 39:00.841
I'm not sure how to say this to you,
but you do sound rather mad.

39:02.259 --> 39:03.468
Jack?

39:04.678 --> 39:05.929
At your service.

39:06.638 --> 39:07.639
Where's Danny?

39:08.223 --> 39:09.224
He's here.

39:10.392 --> 39:12.186
He's asleep, but he's here.

39:13.854 --> 39:15.314
And before you try to convince me

39:15.314 --> 39:19.401
that this is some sort of
psychological condition,

39:20.819 --> 39:24.198
let me assure you that I am very real.

39:25.574 --> 39:26.867
How is that possible?

39:27.367 --> 39:29.328
Do you understand quantum entanglement?

39:31.330 --> 39:32.623
I'm not familiar with it, no.

39:32.623 --> 39:34.666
It's an emerging theory
in particle physics.

39:36.251 --> 39:40.756
Suggests that separation
is not what we believe it to be.

39:41.423 --> 39:44.927
The idea that two particles
can share characteristics

39:44.927 --> 39:48.096
without being at the same point
in space-time.

39:48.680 --> 39:52.059
I assume you are not an expert
in the sciences.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.143
No, I'm not.

39:54.853 --> 39:58.482
But I do know that Danny needs help.

39:59.024 --> 40:00.442
And I want to help him.

40:00.442 --> 40:04.029
And I think that if I can,
I might be able to get him out of here.

40:04.947 --> 40:06.198
Well, that would be useful.

40:06.198 --> 40:07.658
I just need to talk to him.

40:08.742 --> 40:11.578
Unfortunately, my dear,
I don't think that that would serve.

40:12.162 --> 40:13.163
Why?

40:14.039 --> 40:16.959
Danny's in trouble, Jack.
He desperately needs help.

40:17.459 --> 40:19.044
Do forgive me for my immodesty,

40:20.921 --> 40:23.423
but that's what guardian angels are for,
wouldn't you say?

40:25.968 --> 40:27.177
I'll consider your request.

40:27.678 --> 40:30.264
Jack. Jack.

40:30.264 --> 40:32.558
- Thank you for the clothes.
- We still have more time.

40:33.058 --> 40:34.768
You're not doing Danny any favors.

40:37.604 --> 40:38.605
Guard.

40:38.605 --> 40:41.233
Are you aware that these sessions
are strictly voluntary?

40:42.651 --> 40:43.944
Be seeing you.

41:10.387 --> 41:11.388
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:11.388 --> 41:12.472
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

41:12.472 --> 41:14.516
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to come by so late.

41:14.516 --> 41:17.227
I just--
I got something that you gotta see.

41:17.769 --> 41:19.188
Um, Rya, I--

41:20.480 --> 41:22.858
Look, I thought you were
on the right path with the Sullivan kid.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.360
You remember that thing he said to you

41:25.360 --> 41:27.154
about how you're never
gonna find the girl?

41:28.113 --> 41:29.239
You can count on that.

41:32.242 --> 41:33.243
All right.

41:34.119 --> 41:36.705
After you see that. Call me.

42:05.817 --> 42:08.403
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me again.

42:08.403 --> 42:11.657
- Well, I was in the neighborhood.
- I'm still hoping to talk to Danny.

42:12.824 --> 42:14.243
So you've said.

42:14.243 --> 42:18.664
What is it exactly
that you are so desperate to talk about?

42:20.832 --> 42:23.168
You said you preferred Jung to Freud.

42:23.794 --> 42:26.588
Jung would say that you can't live
without understanding your shadow.

42:27.631 --> 42:29.842
I've been doing some reading myself.

42:30.759 --> 42:34.930
People who share a body
can have a keen survival instinct.

42:34.930 --> 42:36.765
Almost a sixth sense about others.

42:40.435 --> 42:41.436
Look at me.

42:41.979 --> 42:44.523
Really look at me
and tell me if you think...

42:46.859 --> 42:48.193
that I'd wanna hurt Danny.

42:58.912 --> 43:00.455
You are somewhat selfish.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.417
And somewhat lost.

43:04.710 --> 43:05.711
But no.

43:07.421 --> 43:09.214
In fact, you are much the opposite.

43:10.132 --> 43:11.842
You said you were his guardian angel?

43:13.302 --> 43:15.888
He has got to understand his own past.

43:16.889 --> 43:19.558
It's the best way
that I can prepare him for trial.

43:20.559 --> 43:23.562
It's the best way
that I can get him and you out of here.

43:24.646 --> 43:27.608
You and I want the same thing.
We want to help Danny.

43:27.608 --> 43:29.902
But I cannot do it if I can't talk to him.

43:33.572 --> 43:34.573
Okay.

43:37.159 --> 43:38.452
I'm asking you to be gentle.

43:42.497 --> 43:45.626
He doesn't really know about us.

43:46.710 --> 43:47.711
Us?

43:51.340 --> 43:52.966
How many of you are there, Jack?

44:17.491 --> 44:18.492
Where am I?

44:23.330 --> 44:24.331
Where am I?

44:24.957 --> 44:25.999
Danny?

44:26.875 --> 44:27.876
Who are you?

44:31.129 --> 44:32.464
I would like to leave now.

44:34.299 --> 44:35.634
I would like to leave now.

44:36.176 --> 44:38.554
Danny, you're in jail.
You're at Rikers Island.

44:40.389 --> 44:41.515
And my name is Rya.

44:45.644 --> 44:47.563
And I'm here to help you.

44:49.731 --> 44:50.732
Okay? I'm--

44:52.776 --> 44:56.363
Do you know why you're here, Danny?

44:59.491 --> 45:02.202
Yes. Because of what happened with Ariana.

45:02.202 --> 45:03.453
That's good.

45:04.454 --> 45:06.915
I have these blank spots.

45:10.210 --> 45:13.005
It happens to me sometimes,
but not like this.

45:14.089 --> 45:15.632
This is different.

45:17.176 --> 45:18.302
You're okay.

45:21.638 --> 45:23.265
We don't have to talk right now.

45:25.559 --> 45:26.977
Danny, we can just sit here.

45:28.687 --> 45:29.688
Is that okay?

45:34.234 --> 45:35.527
And maybe...

45:37.696 --> 45:38.780
take a few breaths.

45:50.626 --> 45:51.627
Are you hungry?

45:53.795 --> 45:54.630
What?

45:54.630 --> 45:56.507
Would you like something to eat?

46:04.139 --> 46:05.516
Good.

47:12.416 --> 47:14.042
<i>How long were you living there?</i>

47:17.296 --> 47:18.297
A couple of years.

47:19.131 --> 47:20.883
<i>Is it possible that you did things</i>

47:20.883 --> 47:22.509
<i>that maybe you don't remember?</i>

47:23.677 --> 47:25.262
What are you writing?

47:25.262 --> 47:27.389
Please go on.
You were telling me about Ariana.

47:27.973 --> 47:28.974
Thank you.

47:29.725 --> 47:31.768
<i>Rockefeller Center was her idea, right?</i>

47:32.352 --> 47:33.729
<i>Why do you keep asking me that?</i>

47:34.313 --> 47:36.773
Danny, are you really willing
to take the blame for this?

47:37.357 --> 47:39.443
I guess my stepfather thought
that I was trouble.

47:39.443 --> 47:41.153
Why? What did you do that was trouble?

47:41.778 --> 47:43.238
<i>I'm gonna ask you again.</i>

47:43.238 --> 47:45.699
<i>Don't you think it's time
we talk about what happened to Adam?</i>

47:45.699 --> 47:46.909
<i>What are you not telling me?</i>

47:46.909 --> 47:49.077
<i>What happened to Yitzhak?
What are you not telling yourself?</i>

47:50.120 --> 47:51.747
<i>Where did they all go?
You assaulted someone...</i>

47:51.747 --> 47:53.040
No, Jonny assaulted someone.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.875
- <i>...to steal a gun.</i>
- <i>I did not shoot anybody.</i>

47:54.875 --> 47:55.876
- Why London?
- Isn't it obvious?

47:55.876 --> 47:56.835
<i>An Israeli expat.</i>

47:56.835 --> 47:58.378
<i>An American girl. British businessman.</i>

47:58.378 --> 47:59.296
And your father.

47:59.296 --> 48:02.633
- They're all in this together.
- Is it possible you had reached a limit?

48:03.217 --> 48:04.218
I'm done.

48:05.719 --> 48:07.596
I think it's time he knows the truth.

48:24.571 --> 48:27.783
I got eggs so at least there's
something here in the morning.

48:31.745 --> 48:34.414
- Really?
- You know, I'm almost 40, Mom.

48:35.874 --> 48:37.793
Old people aren't alcoholics?

48:38.961 --> 48:40.712
That is insulting in so many ways.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.132
So, where's Ezra?

48:45.175 --> 48:47.386
Shit.
I said I would go up and read to him.

48:52.057 --> 48:53.392
What is this thing?

48:53.392 --> 48:55.394
You can't even pay attention
to your own son.

48:55.394 --> 48:57.563
This thing is a patient.

48:58.063 --> 48:59.064
A boy.

49:00.148 --> 49:05.320
Someone hurt him terribly,
and so I need to get him to talk about it.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.906
Maybe a little more attention at home

49:07.906 --> 49:09.241
- and a little less--
- Mom.

49:14.413 --> 49:15.664
So what happened to him?

49:17.124 --> 49:19.710
If I'm right,
I wouldn't wanna talk about it either.

49:20.335 --> 49:21.420
So use the turtle.

49:22.421 --> 49:24.047
- Sorry?
- The turtle.

49:26.633 --> 49:29.511
When you were little
you could never talk about your feelings.

49:29.511 --> 49:32.306
The irony is not lost on me.

49:32.931 --> 49:35.767
So your father would ask you,
"How's the turtle?"

49:36.518 --> 49:38.854
The stuffed one he gave you.
You don't remember?

49:39.354 --> 49:40.397
No.

49:40.397 --> 49:42.191
You would say the turtle
is angry about this,

49:42.191 --> 49:43.775
or the turtle is sad about that.

49:44.693 --> 49:46.528
- Marvin.
- Mortimer.

49:49.364 --> 49:51.658
He wasn't all bad, your father.
Just mostly.

49:51.658 --> 49:54.286
No. Not all bad.

49:58.373 --> 49:59.666
Marty.

49:59.666 --> 50:01.960
- Mortimer.
- Whatever.

50:02.544 --> 50:04.588
He's a turtle.

50:05.088 --> 50:06.089
Go read to him.

50:07.216 --> 50:08.217
Okay.

50:12.429 --> 50:14.640
- Mommy.
- Coming, baby.

50:32.866 --> 50:36.578
Danny, now, how about we go further back?

50:40.999 --> 50:43.585
How about we...

50:47.256 --> 50:48.507
How about we talk about...

50:52.094 --> 50:53.887
you, when you were a little boy?

50:56.682 --> 50:57.683
What about it?

50:58.183 --> 50:59.935
Can you tell me about the good times?

51:02.104 --> 51:03.981
Let's start with Adam.

51:03.981 --> 51:06.400
You were twins, right?

51:07.109 --> 51:09.319
"Joined at the hip"
is what my mom used to say.

51:10.070 --> 51:11.697
So tell me about Adam.

51:14.491 --> 51:15.784
Well, what do you wanna know?

51:16.410 --> 51:18.245
Can you tell me a happy memory?

51:20.163 --> 51:23.500
We were in grade school. My brother and I.

51:24.793 --> 51:27.254
It was summer, the tail end.
You know, when school's back.

51:29.590 --> 51:31.216
Adam always had my back. You know.

51:31.216 --> 51:32.718
I really miss him.

51:37.764 --> 51:40.601
Well, what happened to him?

51:49.985 --> 51:51.361
Could you tell me about it?

51:54.323 --> 51:56.658
I don't want to--

51:56.658 --> 51:57.743
It's okay.

52:01.079 --> 52:02.331
Well, I have a hunch.

52:04.082 --> 52:05.501
Did he do something for you?

52:06.251 --> 52:07.794
Something that was very hard?

52:10.214 --> 52:11.924
Something only a brother would do.

52:15.552 --> 52:17.054
Did it have to do with Marlin?

52:22.476 --> 52:23.685
Danny...

52:24.603 --> 52:30.609
it's really important
that you try and tell me.

52:33.487 --> 52:35.239
And we can stop at anytime.

52:36.990 --> 52:40.244
But it's important that you try.

52:45.082 --> 52:46.083
Okay.

52:50.546 --> 52:51.839
We were in the car.

52:54.925 --> 52:56.301
I was sitting in the front.

52:57.469 --> 52:58.470
Adam in the back.

53:01.473 --> 53:03.225
We had no idea where we were going.

53:09.356 --> 53:10.691
Marlin used to own a barn.

53:13.652 --> 53:15.028
And he would take us there.

53:17.072 --> 53:18.824
But he would only ever take Adam inside.
