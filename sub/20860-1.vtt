Yes.

I'm sorry you didn't call me

I'm not disappointed.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.311

I hope that you're pleased
with everything.

I want you to be happy.

03:57.136 --> 04:01.007
I mean, with your room and all.

04:02.508 --> 04:06.079

Oh, no. It's all right.

No, of course not.

This is your home.

04:26.899 --> 04:30.770
But maybe Henry and I could
find another place?

04:32.205 --> 04:36.409
This is half my house, Grace.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.846
We-we could find something
smaller.

would be fine.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.950
This place is so large and...

04:43.950 --> 04:46.152
Old. Very old.

04:46.152 --> 04:50.690

Now and forever.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.704
I don't want to leave.

05:04.704 --> 05:08.641
I need you to understand that
before the wedding.

05:10.376 --> 05:14.580
Maybe you could give us a
moment?

06:45.538 --> 06:50.576
I've never seen such a
beautiful album.

06:50.576 --> 06:55.014
I don't think there's anything
of much importance

06:55.014 --> 06:56.649
from my childhood that wasn't
photographed

06:56.649 --> 06:58.651
and mounted in one of those
albums.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.821
Why do you suppose we do that?

07:01.821 --> 07:04.991
Do you think we were trying to
hold back time

07:04.991 --> 07:06.993
by capturing the moment with
pictures?

07:06.993 --> 07:10.229
Well, I think that

07:10.229 --> 07:12.698
Or maybe it was our way of
becoming immortal.

07:15.334 --> 07:20.173
I think you'd like to see your
room..

07:42.161 --> 07:46.799
I hope that someday you can
forget how we became engaged.

07:46.799 --> 07:50.570
I mean, how we met and all.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.973
What are you trying to say?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.575
Well, I have a feeling that
you don't respect me

07:55.575 --> 07:57.810
because I had to find a husband
through those computer people.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.681
No. I mean, what about me?

08:01.681 --> 08:03.749
I went on that website too,
didn't I? To meet you?

08:17.830 --> 08:22.668
I was wondering where the
ceremony is going to...

08:22.668 --> 08:26.439
I mean, are we going to be
married here?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.608
At the house?

08:28.608 --> 08:29.942
No. At the Justice of the
Peace.

08:29.942 --> 08:33.779
I'd like to... have a more
formal wedding,

08:33.779 --> 08:36.414
but we don't have many friends.

08:36.414 --> 08:39.986
To invite, that is.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.821
In fact, we don't have many
friends at all.

08:41.821 --> 08:46.259
Oh. Well that's all right.

08:46.259 --> 08:50.530
I understand.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.465
The Justice of the Peace is
fine.

08:52.465 --> 08:56.969
You know something?

08:56.969 --> 08:59.138
We haven't I mean, you
haven't...

08:59.138 --> 09:02.241
Haven't what?

09:02.241 --> 09:04.877
Nothing.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.179
It must have been something.

09:07.179 --> 09:11.284
You'll think I'm silly.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.453
Tell me.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.856
It's just that...

09:16.856 --> 09:18.357
you haven't... kissed me yet.

09:29.669 --> 09:34.206
You really better unpack this.

Oh..

You look sick.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.215
What's wrong? What's the
matter?

09:44.517 --> 09:47.587
You're shy.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.522
Is that it?

09:49.522 --> 09:52.358
You don't have to be bashful.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.827
We're practically married.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.431
Would you like me to put that
on?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.800
Is that it?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.903
That is what it is, isn't it?

10:03.903 --> 10:05.938

filmy, seductive gown.

10:05.938 --> 10:10.977

come on.

10:12.378 --> 10:16.349

What's wrong? What is it?
What's-what's the matter?

of these witnesses,

10:45.811 --> 10:49.482

wedded wife?

death do us part?

blocks away.

31:51.009 --> 31:54.679
Would you like to come over
for a drink?

32:41.125 --> 32:45.963
My car's a half-block away.

33:07.218 --> 33:12.156
I'll go get the coffee.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.756
Actually... do you have
cookies and milk?

33:26.371 --> 33:31.008
So do you live here alone?

33:31.008 --> 33:32.643
With my roommate, Georgette.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.746
She's really nice.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.447
I mean, really.

33:36.447 --> 33:40.051
Why are you still standing?

33:40.051 --> 33:41.853
Oh.

33:45.323 --> 33:49.961
We've been living together for
about a year now,

33:49.961 --> 33:52.597
and we get along just great.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.098
Actually, she's the only truly
beautiful person I know.

33:54.098 --> 33:58.302
On the inside.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.271
Know what I mean? Yeah.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.540
Yeah, I know what you mean.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.476
So, um, why did you go to that
movie tonight?

34:05.476 --> 34:08.212
You like to watch movies where
guys race cars?

34:10.547 --> 34:11.983
Actually, no, I don't like any
of that stuff.

34:11.983 --> 34:14.652
But I had nothing to do,

34:14.652 --> 34:17.522
so... who knows why I would
watch something I don't like.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.893
Why do they race cars anyway?

34:21.893 --> 34:23.960
The guys in the cars?

34:23.960 --> 34:28.433
Well, I mean,

34:28.433 --> 34:30.668
guys who race cars like that in the movies and real
life usually are hung up on trying to prove something,

34:30.668 --> 34:31.969
you know what I mean?

34:31.969 --> 34:35.306
Proving what?

34:35.306 --> 34:37.375
Oh, I don't know. Their
masculinity I suppose.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.310
Or... or maybe trying to cover
up for some insecurity

34:39.310 --> 34:42.380
during their formative years.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.283
Wow.

34:45.283 --> 34:46.784
You know a lot about psychology.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.954
Did you study it in school?

34:49.954 --> 34:53.324
Psychology, I mean.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.960
Well, I read every book I can
get my hands on. You know?

34:55.960 --> 34:59.297
Because it's really interesting.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.433
You start to understand why people behave
the way they do. Well, why do they?

35:02.433 --> 35:05.636
Behave like they do?

35:05.636 --> 35:07.472
Well, because they're programmed
that way from their past years.

35:07.472 --> 35:11.576
You know? And then it just
becomes like a computer.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.345
People start just behaving
that way

35:14.345 --> 35:16.481
because of their programming.

35:16.481 --> 35:19.050
So there's nothing we can do
about it?

35:19.050 --> 35:22.687
Mm. Very difficult to change.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.756
Especially when some if it
becomes a compulsion.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.228
Well, I have a lot of really
silly compulsions

35:30.228 --> 35:32.630
like not stepping on a crack
in a sidewalk.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.633
No matter what, I just can't
do it.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.236
Step in a crack.

35:38.236 --> 35:40.605
You know what I mean?

35:40.605 --> 35:44.542
Is there anything from your past
that's fucking you up nowadays?

35:46.611 --> 35:51.149
Um...

35:51.149 --> 35:54.619
Was there?

36:03.027 --> 36:07.165
Would you like to kiss me?
What?

36:09.333 --> 36:12.837
Kiss me. Would you like to?

36:17.808 --> 36:20.244
Uh...

36:20.244 --> 36:22.647
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

36:22.647 --> 36:24.182
Of course not.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.817
Then why won't you kiss me?

36:26.817 --> 36:31.088
It's just that I like to work
up to it, okay?

36:31.088 --> 36:32.823
Is there anything wrong with
that?

36:34.191 --> 36:35.526
Foreplay for a kiss?

36:35.526 --> 36:38.029
God, you really are something.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.865
Oh, God...

36:40.865 --> 36:44.402
I'm just not used to girls being so
aggressive, you know?

36:44.402 --> 36:46.771
And it frightens you.

36:51.809 --> 36:56.847
And it frightens you.

37:08.326 --> 37:12.330
No, no, no, no.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.699
How many times do I have to
remind you

37:14.699 --> 37:16.634
that you're my sister,
Catherine?

37:16.634 --> 37:18.402
Aren't the two children I've
given you enough?

37:18.402 --> 37:21.706
Oh, Henry.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.841
Why do you torture yourself
trying to have sex

37:23.841 --> 37:26.243
with these girls?

37:26.243 --> 37:28.879
And failing over and over?

37:28.879 --> 37:32.883
When you know I'm the only
woman you can have sex with.

37:42.460 --> 37:47.498
Oh, yeah...

38:01.579 --> 38:06.450
It's getting late.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.419
So why don't we call it a
night, okay?

38:08.419 --> 38:10.054
No. No. No, please just give
me one more

38:10.054 --> 38:13.858
I can't. The door's over there.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.159
The one you came in.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.994
Please go.

38:18.362 --> 38:22.266
No...

38:48.159 --> 38:52.396
You've got to go, Paul.

38:52.396 --> 38:55.433
You have class.

38:55.433 --> 38:58.002
I promise you can kick me out
in eight minutes.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.438
Tomorrow night, okay?

39:00.438 --> 39:03.240
I'll stay in, I'll make
dinner... bye.

39:05.409 --> 39:06.811
I'm all yours tomorrow night!

39:23.494 --> 39:27.164
Helen? Helen? Helen? Oh, God.

39:28.699 --> 39:32.670
Shhh.

39:52.156 --> 39:56.694
You're going to kill me,
aren't you? Like my roommate?

39:56.694 --> 39:59.463
No. Why would I do that?

39:59.463 --> 40:02.933
I like you.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.773
What happened to your roommate
was an accident.

40:14.812 --> 40:19.417
Please let me go. Please.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.352
You like it? Huh?

40:23.120 --> 40:27.792
It really is a nice place once
you get used to it.

40:27.792 --> 40:32.763
You know, my sister Catherine

40:32.763 --> 40:36.667
and I, we grew up here in our childhood.
Now, the place does need a few touches,

40:36.667 --> 40:39.203
but we can get to that
afterwards.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.039
What do you mean afterwards?

40:42.039 --> 40:44.441
After the wedding.

40:44.441 --> 40:46.644
Didn't I tell you?

40:46.644 --> 40:48.112
We're going to be married.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.448
Oh, my God.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.882
You're insane!

41:52.710 --> 41:57.748
Dear God... dear God, please.

41:59.149 --> 42:03.020
Please. Help me.

42:10.427 --> 42:14.732
Good morning, Georgette.

42:31.782 --> 42:36.253
How do you feel this morning?
Hm.

42:47.464 --> 42:51.802
You're not being fair with me.

42:51.802 --> 42:55.573
You know that, right?

43:02.212 --> 43:06.483
You're angry because of what
happened with your roommate.

43:21.532 --> 43:26.837
Well... you'll come to see
that there was no other way.

43:26.837 --> 43:30.541
And then you'll grow to like
me and we'll be married.

43:32.142 --> 43:35.012
Please, let me go.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.548
I won't tell anyone about you.

43:37.548 --> 43:41.385
I won't. Tell anyone about me?

43:41.385 --> 43:43.921
What could you tell about me?

43:43.921 --> 43:46.156
I'm not doing anything wrong.

43:46.156 --> 43:47.992
Anyone who understands will
see that.

43:47.992 --> 43:51.261
I...

43:51.261 --> 43:54.031
I am trying to work things out
in my head.

43:54.031 --> 43:58.102
Do you understand what I'm
saying?

43:58.102 --> 44:00.437
What do you mean w-work things
out?

44:00.437 --> 44:01.872
With my problems.

44:01.872 --> 44:04.141
With... girls?

44:23.660 --> 44:28.599
He won't kill her, will he
Lieutenant?

44:28.599 --> 44:30.667
If he wanted to kill her he
would have done it already.

44:30.667 --> 44:33.103
Like he roommate.

44:33.103 --> 44:34.671
Instead of taking her away.

44:34.671 --> 44:37.741
I don't know, is that what you
think?

44:37.741 --> 44:40.110
Hey, hey. Don't get any God
damned ideas

44:40.110 --> 44:41.779
like I had anything to do with
it.

44:41.779 --> 44:45.082
I love Georgette.

44:45.082 --> 44:48.085
We're going to get married
when I graduate from med school.

44:48.085 --> 44:51.755
How long have you known her?

44:51.755 --> 44:54.358
Little more than a year.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.326
How well did you know the dead
girl?

44:56.326 --> 44:59.263
A little.

44:59.263 --> 45:01.065
She was around a lot when I
came for Georgette.

45:01.065 --> 45:05.302
Meet any of her friends?

45:05.302 --> 45:07.071
Every once in a while she'd
have some guy over.

45:07.071 --> 45:09.339
I don't think I ever saw any
of them more than once.

45:09.339 --> 45:13.010
What type of man did she seem
to prefer?

45:13.010 --> 45:15.712
Any guy with, uh, something
between his legs.

45:17.147 --> 45:20.584
But your girl was different?

45:20.584 --> 45:22.419
I told you we were going to
get married, didn't I?

45:22.419 --> 45:25.556
Yeah. You told me that.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.659
You know, if I hadn't come
back here again today, you guys

45:28.659 --> 45:31.361
would only have each other to
ask these brilliant questions.

45:31.361 --> 45:34.431
Is that what they teach you in
med school?

46:36.160 --> 46:41.198
Hi. Uh, I'm Mr. Borden.

46:42.499 --> 46:46.603
Um... this is the Henry Foster
house isn't it?

46:48.939 --> 46:53.343
Well, I'd like to see my
daughter please.

46:53.343 --> 46:56.547
Your daughter?

46:56.547 --> 46:58.982
Yes. My daughter, Grace.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.551
She got married here a little
while back.

47:00.551 --> 47:01.852
I found this letter with all the
details in her things, and...

47:01.852 --> 47:05.289
Oh, yeah.

47:05.289 --> 47:07.224
She was supposed to marry my
brother.

47:07.224 --> 47:09.927
He's still very upset about
it, so if you're here

47:09.927 --> 47:11.695
to apologize for her you're
wasting your time.

47:11.695 --> 47:13.630
He doesn't need your sympathy.

47:13.630 --> 47:15.566
I-I-I don't understand.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.335
She never showed up.

47:20.304 --> 47:21.705
And just between you and me,
don't you think a computer

47:21.705 --> 47:26.443
is a pretty sleazy way

47:26.443 --> 47:28.643
to meet the person you're
going to spend your life with?

47:29.246 --> 47:32.449
My Grace is a good girl.

47:32.449 --> 47:33.951
Of course she was.

47:33.951 --> 47:38.188
A nice person.

47:38.188 --> 47:40.457
Now, how do you know that?

47:40.457 --> 47:42.459
How do I know what?

47:42.459 --> 47:43.961
How do you know she was a nice
person?

47:43.961 --> 47:45.896
You said she'd never been here.

47:45.896 --> 47:47.431
How do you know?

47:47.431 --> 47:50.133
I'm just trying to be kind to
you.

47:50.133 --> 47:51.868
You also said the word "was"
instead of "is."

47:51.868 --> 47:55.706
So?

47:55.706 --> 47:58.026
So, if something has happened
to my Gracie, I need to know.

47:59.009 --> 48:02.112
You're becoming a pest.

48:02.112 --> 48:06.250
Well... thank you for your
time, miss.

48:06.250 --> 48:08.318
Uh, maybe the police will have
some information for me.

48:08.318 --> 48:12.556
Wait.

48:12.556 --> 48:17.261
I have a better idea.

48:17.261 --> 48:18.895
Why don't you come on inside
and talk to my brother.

48:18.895 --> 48:23.500
I don't know.

48:23.500 --> 48:27.037
Something fishy going on
around here. Come inside.

48:27.037 --> 48:29.006
I'm sure a nice talk with my
brother

48:29.006 --> 48:31.308
will straighten everything out
for you.

48:32.709 --> 48:36.046
Well, just the same.

48:36.046 --> 48:38.548
I'm warning you

48:38.548 --> 48:40.017
if your brother's answers
don't satisfy me,

48:40.017 --> 48:41.818
I will still go to the police.

48:41.818 --> 48:43.053
You-you'll tell him that,
won't you?

48:43.053 --> 48:44.621
Of course.

48:59.903 --> 49:04.308
I'll get my brother.

49:51.488 --> 49:56.626
Like all people, the psychopath

49:56.626 --> 49:58.362
is the product of happenings
in their early childhood years

49:58.362 --> 50:01.765
that reside in their
unconscious mind,

50:01.765 --> 50:03.867
influencing their actions in
their present life.

50:05.268 --> 50:10.207
With the psychopath,

50:10.207 --> 50:11.641
his or her past influences were
of an extremely negative nature,

50:11.641 --> 50:14.978
resulting in an abnormally
excitable state

50:14.978 --> 50:17.948
in their present life

50:17.948 --> 50:20.684
that is constantly on the
verge of exploding into violence

50:24.421 --> 50:28.859
when his or her ego is
threatened.

50:33.029 --> 50:37.868
The psychopath feels no guilt
for their violence thinking

50:39.269 --> 50:42.272
that it is justified.

51:17.240 --> 51:21.511
Oh, sweet Jesus, Gracie!

51:21.511 --> 51:23.513
Gracie!

That's the news for now.

53:50.827 --> 53:52.362
Tune in again for more news
Henry?

53:52.362 --> 53:54.564
On the hour, every hour.

53:54.564 --> 53:55.966
When are you going to realize
that you don't need

53:55.966 --> 53:59.069
all the others to regain your
masculinity?

54:00.437 --> 54:03.974
To have sex?

54:03.974 --> 54:06.343
You can still do it with your
sister, can't you?

54:09.913 --> 54:13.216
I've got Georgette now.

54:32.202 --> 54:36.940
I doubt if our victim knew her
killer.

54:36.940 --> 54:38.642
My guess is that she picked
him up at a bar

54:38.642 --> 54:41.811
or a dance or someplace,

54:41.811 --> 54:43.680
and brought him back to her
apartment.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.582
Then when she wouldn't give him
what he wanted, he killed her.

54:45.582 --> 54:48.685
Wouldn't he have raped her
before he killed her?

54:48.685 --> 54:50.287
Well, he might have been
incapable.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.756
Couldn't get it up.

54:52.756 --> 54:54.357
That's the way it is with many
rapists.

54:54.357 --> 54:56.593
They substitute violence for
the sex act.

54:57.994 --> 54:59.262
Bingo. We've got a lead!

55:06.636 --> 55:11.174
Oh, yeah. I noticed her when
she went in.

55:11.174 --> 55:13.243
She was alone, you know?

55:13.243 --> 55:15.445
Long hair... nice ass.

55:15.445 --> 55:19.549
And like I told this other
policeman,

55:19.549 --> 55:21.384
she was with a guy when she
left.

55:21.384 --> 55:24.154
Have you seen the man before?

55:24.154 --> 55:25.488
Another movie perhaps?

55:25.488 --> 55:28.692
No. No, I don't think so.

55:28.692 --> 55:32.195
I'm going to take you down to
the station

55:32.195 --> 55:33.563
so you can talk to our artist.

55:33.563 --> 55:36.499
If there's any information you
can give

55:36.499 --> 55:39.703
them about a description, it would be a big help.
Yeah, sure. Uh, happy to help anyway I can.

55:39.703 --> 55:43.006
How come you remember them so
well?

55:44.340 --> 55:46.343
Hey, man.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.844
It's not every day you see a
girl with an ass that great.

55:47.844 --> 55:51.314
Not the way she moved when she
walked.

56:54.644 --> 56:59.149
Trying to remember your past,
Henry?

57:01.451 --> 57:02.931
Trying to remember what fucked
you up?

57:04.521 --> 57:08.758
You're wasting your time, Henry.

57:08.758 --> 57:12.195
You're wasting your time.

57:37.086 --> 57:41.558
That squeaking noise you're
hearing from the backyard

57:41.558 --> 57:44.227
is Henry's swing.

57:44.227 --> 57:48.031
He's been out there all night.

57:48.031 --> 57:50.934
You'd think he'd get tired of
it, wouldn't you?

57:52.335 --> 57:55.438
He doesn't though.

57:55.438 --> 57:59.042
I thought I'd go out there and
tell him to come inside...

57:59.042 --> 58:03.179
he'd never leave that stupid
swing.

58:03.179 --> 58:07.150
What does he think about all
the time?

58:07.150 --> 58:11.287
You. He's wondering how long
he can control himself

58:13.957 --> 58:18.962
before he'll kill you. But he
said...

58:18.962 --> 58:21.297
It doesn't matter what he
said, he has to do it.

58:22.732 --> 58:26.769
He'll try to make love to you.

58:26.769 --> 58:29.772
And he'll fail.

58:29.772 --> 58:33.476
And then he'll kill you.

58:33.476 --> 58:34.777
It's the way it's been with
all of them.

58:34.777 --> 58:36.546
You have to help me, Catherine.

58:47.257 --> 58:51.861
How do you expect me to eat
tied up like a dog?

59:03.439 --> 59:08.144
I'll free you,

59:08.144 --> 59:11.447
but you have to promise to be
a good girl. Okay?

59:17.553 --> 59:22.292
I have some money.

59:22.292 --> 59:23.932
I-I can get more if you'll
just let me go.

59:25.194 --> 59:26.696
Oh, money?

59:26.696 --> 59:30.400
I don't need your money.

59:30.400 --> 59:33.036
Mother left everything to me.

59:33.036 --> 59:35.138
Every penny.

59:35.138 --> 59:37.373
She knows how irresponsible
Henry can be.

59:37.373 --> 59:40.510
You know, he's only a child.

59:40.510 --> 59:44.113
Sick.

59:44.113 --> 59:45.915
You're both sick.

59:45.915 --> 59:48.035
Catherine, I didn't mean it.

59:51.821 --> 59:56.859
And...

59:56.859 --> 59:58.294
I didn't
mean it. Please.

59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.496
Help me, Catherine.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.732
Help me. Catherine? Catherine!

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:05.335
You have to help me. Catherine!

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:06.769
You have to help me.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.204
You have to... Catherine,
don't go!

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:39.555
Father, I've come to confess
my misdeeds.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:45.161
At times, I...

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.964
I talk mean at my sister and...

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:50.933
sometimes I treat young ladies
with disrespect.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:07.383
I brought you some graham
crackers and milk.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:19.128
Aren't you going to eat them?

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:22.131
I love graham crackers dunked
in milk, don't you?

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:26.169
You're a sick animal.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:30.573
I really wish you wouldn't say
things like that.

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:35.011
You know, it wasn't over for
your roommate.

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:37.613
It really wasn't.

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.250
I took pictures of her.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.586
You killed her. She's dead.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:46.122
No. I took pictures of her.

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:50.493

It's a new sketch.

No. Never.

Any other leads? Nah.

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:22.064
