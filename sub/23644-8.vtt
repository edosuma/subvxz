WEBVTT

00:10.711 --> 00:13.479
It's all evil.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.415
They could be related
to the cars.

00:16.417 --> 00:20.185
I am seeing a shotgun.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.920
So I know this guy
gets whacked.

00:21.922 --> 00:25.190
He tells me stuff that a 3-
or 4-year-old shouldn't know.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.393
I'm afraid
for his safety.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.330
Is this for real
right now?

00:31.332 --> 00:35.000
You can die very early.

00:35.002 --> 00:38.537
Definitely not a good situation
to be in.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.273
Panic, panic, panic.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.341
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.843
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.279
The house just feels bad.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.781
I see dead people.

00:49.783 --> 00:54.319
This man is completely insane.

00:54.321 --> 00:57.222
I speak to dead people.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.458
Okay, she doesn't
like it in there.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.459
And they speak to me.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.429
He likes to twist that knife.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.998
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.569
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.170
I rely on my partner.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.839
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.008
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.609
Now, does he die right
there on the spot?

01:17.611 --> 01:21.613
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.215
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.151
It's my job to reveal them.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.153
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:28.155 --> 01:29.955
But Steve and I never speak...

01:29.957 --> 01:32.090
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.558
...until the very end...

01:33.560 --> 01:35.493
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.496
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:37.498 --> 01:39.698
I don't want anything to
happen to my daughter.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.633
...or time to get out.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.969
His goal is to kill you guys.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

01:58.885 --> 02:01.820
I'm in Oregon, Ohio.
It's right outside of Toledo.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.355
I got a call
from a married couple.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.390
Now, they bought an old building
in town

02:05.392 --> 02:07.826
and turned it
into their dream business,

02:07.828 --> 02:09.294
but the second they brought
their son

02:09.295 --> 02:11.897
onto the property,
everything went to hell.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.565
Now they're afraid everyone
who walks

02:13.567 --> 02:15.467
through those doors
is in danger,

02:15.469 --> 02:19.871
and I'm hoping Amy
and I can help them out.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.940
Before Amy arrives,

02:21.942 --> 02:25.210
I sweep the area
of any leading information.

02:25.212 --> 02:28.947
This is a large space
with a lot of photos,

02:28.949 --> 02:31.549
electronic equipment,

02:31.551 --> 02:34.086
and children's toys,

02:34.088 --> 02:37.289
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.892
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:55.408 --> 02:59.278
I heard
this gravelly-sounding voice,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.980
and it was, like, yelling at me,

03:01.982 --> 03:04.249
and all I heard was,
"Dark and cold,"

03:04.251 --> 03:08.053
and they kept repeating this
over and over and over.

03:08.055 --> 03:11.490
"Dark, dark.
It's all dark. Evil."

03:11.492 --> 03:13.592
It's not good.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.000
So, Jamie,
when we spoke on the phone,

03:22.002 --> 03:23.869
you were breaking
my heart.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.404
You didn't sound too good.
What's going on?

03:26.406 --> 03:28.941
Myself and my husband work here
together every day,

03:28.943 --> 03:32.210
and there's been a lot
of paranormal activity

03:32.212 --> 03:35.747
that's going on
that's not safe.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.816
All right, so obviously,
you guys don't live here.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.017
What's the business here?
What's going on here?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.619
My husband owns
a towing company,

03:40.621 --> 03:42.621
and we tow for the police
departments in the area,

03:42.623 --> 03:47.225
and I own and operate
my own one-station salon.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.029
We bring my 4-year-old
to work with us every day,

03:51.031 --> 03:57.368
and with what's going on,
I am afraid for his safety.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.371
Okay, so I'm assuming
this is your son here?

03:59.373 --> 04:01.406
It is. Brody.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.575
He's a big boy.
He is.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.210
Now you seem to think
there's a connection

04:05.212 --> 04:07.812
between Brody
and all the activity.
Yeah.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.182
Ever since Brody
has been here,

04:10.184 --> 04:12.383
it seems like more
has happened.

04:12.385 --> 04:16.754
He's telling me that he's seeing
and talking to people.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.457
I'm concerned
that something bad

04:19.459 --> 04:21.459
could happen
while he's around.

04:21.461 --> 04:25.864
Can you give me a list of
what you guys are going through?

04:25.866 --> 04:30.201
Hearing voices,
objects moving on their own,

04:30.203 --> 04:34.906
seeing shadow figures,
things have gotten physical.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.075
Our health is just
deteriorating.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.643
Health issues --
What are talking about?

04:38.645 --> 04:42.080
I have headaches
more often than I don't,

04:42.082 --> 04:45.617
constant neck
and back pain, nausea,

04:45.619 --> 04:49.954
and Brian
is so unhealthy,

04:49.956 --> 04:53.158
and it wasn't like that
until we were here.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.460
Now do you know any history
about the property?

04:55.462 --> 05:00.499
We knew about the previous
owner's death on the property.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.367
The owner's name
was John.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.102
All right, so that's something
I'm gonna look into,

05:04.104 --> 05:05.403
so I got to ask you --

05:05.405 --> 05:07.639
What do you think is here,
and what the hell does want?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.541
I'm not really sure
what's here,

05:09.543 --> 05:12.977
but it almost feels like someone
is trying to get us out.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.145
Why do you say that?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.248
I was taking care
of a client,

05:16.250 --> 05:19.717
and Brody came running
in a panic.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.719
"We need to leave right now.
We can't be here anymore.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.088
We're not allowed
to be here anymore,"

05:23.090 --> 05:26.191
crying, with tears literally
running down his face.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.459
That'll kill you
as a mother.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.827
It's awful.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.263
How do you explain something
that you don't even know

05:32.265 --> 05:34.399
what's really happening,
you know?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.404
I know, honey.

05:39.406 --> 05:43.875
You got a lot on your plate,
sweetheart.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.078
We'll get
through this, okay?

05:54.087 --> 05:56.921
I'm seeing a group of dead
people out here.

05:56.923 --> 06:03.695
These dead people
are confused and depressed.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.698
They could be related
to the cars.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.172
They're all just kind of
like...

06:14.174 --> 06:15.540
lost.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.843
How might living here --
How might that affect them?

06:18.845 --> 06:24.583
It's gonna cause a lot of fear,
panic, and depression.

06:24.585 --> 06:30.689
They might see, like,
gray figures moving out here.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.060
These dead people want
to go inside,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.429
but something
is stopping them,

06:37.431 --> 06:42.600
and I think that is where
the issues arise.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.874
This is where Brody normally
plays when I'm doing hair.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.544
Some pretty cool stuff in here.
What's going on?

06:52.546 --> 06:56.414
The anxiety level for all of us
is through the roof.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.082
And how does this last?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.151
Sometimes it's until
we go home.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.821
And this is affecting
Brody, as well?
Yes.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.656
So is Brody
actually here today?

07:04.658 --> 07:08.360
He is. Brody?

07:08.362 --> 07:10.362
Hi. Come here.
Hi.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.829
Can you say hi
to Steve?

07:11.831 --> 07:13.131
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

07:14.500 --> 07:17.435
So, Brody, Mom tells me that
you talk to somebody out here.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.604
Do you know
their name?

07:21.140 --> 07:22.107
John.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.311
You talk to two different
people named John,

07:26.313 --> 07:28.747
or is it one person that looks
like two different people?

07:30.184 --> 07:31.416
Do they scare you
at all?

07:31.418 --> 07:32.918
Do they talk to you?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.289
Okay. You feel better
when you leave here?

07:40.493 --> 07:42.794
Well, buddy, thanks for
telling me what's going on.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.462
I'm gonna finish talking
with Mommy.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.798
Would you mind going,
playing in the other room?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.400
Okay. Good.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.003
Go ahead.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.072
He's a cute kid.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.073
All right.
So anything else?

07:55.075 --> 07:59.544
I saw a full-body,
male apparition

07:59.546 --> 08:02.680
standing there with his fist
clenched, facing me.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.349
So, was there any customers
maybe came in?

08:05.351 --> 08:07.052
I thought someone
had broke in,

08:07.054 --> 08:09.287
and then when I looked up again,
he was gone.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.489
What was running through
your head when that happened?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.891
That I was in danger.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.460
I felt like he was ready to,
like, rush me.

08:20.968 --> 08:25.670
There's a different, older group
of dead people in here.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.339
My feeling is, this group

08:27.341 --> 08:30.976
doesn't want the other group
of dead in here.

08:30.978 --> 08:35.613
This older group is trying to,
you know,

08:35.615 --> 08:38.249
get everybody out, like,
the living and the dead.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.317
How?

08:39.318 --> 08:43.321
They're projecting
these weird images

08:43.323 --> 08:46.524
to try to scare
the living to run away.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.797
Meanwhile, they're also
fighting with the dead outside

08:52.799 --> 08:55.634
to keep them
locked out of here.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.936
Those older dead are bullies.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.872
They're bullying them,
you know what I'm saying?

09:04.911 --> 09:06.945
So, Jamie, obviously this
is where you do

09:06.947 --> 09:08.246
the hair and stuff,
right?
Yep.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.681
Okay, so what's
going on?

09:09.683 --> 09:13.618
I constantly have headaches,
pain down my neck, my back,

09:13.620 --> 09:18.189
like I was beat up
by multiple people

09:18.191 --> 09:20.158
or like someone actually
has you

09:20.160 --> 09:21.960
by the back
of your neck...
Okay.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.562
...and just squeezing
and squeezing and squeezing

09:24.564 --> 09:27.431
until, like, you can't
even bear any more.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.433
Do you have
any injuries?
No.

09:29.435 --> 09:30.568
I've been going
to the doctor's.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.036
I went through
all kinds of tests,

09:32.038 --> 09:33.838
and they can find
nothing.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.107
Okay,
so anything else?

09:36.109 --> 09:39.944
Extreme mood swings with
all three of us, even Brody.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.246
How's it happen?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.583
I can just be normal,
everything's fine.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.820
I'm happy to be at work,
and something minor will happen,

09:48.822 --> 09:51.623
and it will literally
send me off the deep end,

09:51.625 --> 09:55.793
and I feel like I want
to just hurt someone.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.195
Okay. Is that
your personality?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.329
Not at all.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.131
So is it always
the anger thing,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.933
or do you have
any other emotions?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.736
Sometimes it's just like
extreme sadness.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.138
Is it affecting your
relationship with your husband?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.140
It makes it
extremely difficult.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.376
Every day, it feels like it
should be the end of the world,

10:11.378 --> 10:12.811
and we should
just give up.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.279
Easy thing would be
to just get the hell out.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.448
I don't want
to do that.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.216
This is our life,
and we just want it to be normal

10:19.218 --> 10:20.752
and feel safe.
Right.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.154
But right now,
I feel like it's not.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.226
The fighting between
the two groups of dead

10:28.228 --> 10:29.894
is really bad.

10:29.896 --> 10:33.298
It seems like it's territorial.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.366
Do you know if the living
might have any experiences

10:35.368 --> 10:36.835
because of their
interactions?

10:36.837 --> 10:40.371
I think living people would be
subjected to the stress

10:40.373 --> 10:42.106
that the dead
are feeling here.

10:42.108 --> 10:47.912
The living would feel sudden,
you know, like, rage.

10:51.017 --> 10:54.318
They might lash out
at other living people.

10:54.320 --> 10:59.557
I think that the living
would feel intense vertigo,

10:59.559 --> 11:03.561
the vomiting, the depression.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.697
They're making me feel sick.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.086
So, Brian, I was talking
to your wife,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.787
and she doesn't feel
it's safe here

11:29.789 --> 11:32.123
for anybody in your family,
especially your son.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.825
I mean, do you
agree with that?
Yes, I do.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.928
He's experiencing a lot,
and I know it's affecting him.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.131
In what way?
He's seeing people
that aren't there.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.901
He tells me stuff that a 3-
or 4-year-old shouldn't know.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.937
This is a dangerous place
to start with,

11:45.939 --> 11:49.073
and I'm just afraid
he could get hurt,

11:49.075 --> 11:53.378
seriously hurt,
if not killed.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.079
Your wife mentioned
your health.
Yes.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.214
What's up with that?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.683
I've had several sort
of major issues.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.018
Bell's palsy was
the first thing I had,

12:01.020 --> 12:02.286
ulcerative colitis.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.256
It's very hard to even
sometimes get out of bed,

12:05.258 --> 12:06.991
and I also feel drained
all the time.

12:06.993 --> 12:10.361
So have you seen doctors
about all these health issues?
Yes.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.564
They have no idea what causes
it, and it's getting worse.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.300
When I was talking to Jamie,
she was mentioning to me

12:15.302 --> 12:17.235
about mood swings.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.769
I mean, have you noticed it
affecting you?

12:18.771 --> 12:20.505
I have.
When I'm here, like,

12:20.507 --> 12:22.907
if my son
does something very minor,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.576
I will sometimes
feel extremely angry,

12:24.578 --> 12:27.312
and if he would do the same
thing when we're at home,

12:27.314 --> 12:28.713
it's just not a big deal.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.182
Well, we'll have to see
what Amy says about all that.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.051
Now, have you had
any experiences

12:33.053 --> 12:35.186
that are definitely
paranormal?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.589
I saw a shadow figure
over this way,

12:37.591 --> 12:39.824
and I've seen that
at least 15 to 20 times.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.859
When I'd walk up
to the door,

12:41.861 --> 12:44.162
I would see somebody
sticking their head,

12:44.164 --> 12:45.530
and their shoulder
would be sticking out.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.599
As soon as they see me,
they dart back inside.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.400
What the hell was going through
your mind when you saw that?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.169
It actually scared me 'cause
I thought somebody

12:51.171 --> 12:53.271
had broke in my building
while we were closed,

12:53.273 --> 12:54.672
and I searched
the whole building.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.207
There was nothing there.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.214
There's an old,
dead guy in here.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.951
I think he's in charge
of the dead inside.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.821
I just feel really dizzy,
really sick, nauseous.

13:10.823 --> 13:14.425
These are things I think
the living would feel.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.965
This older dude,
he likes things organized.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.967
He likes things a certain way,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.970
and he definitely influences
the living

13:25.972 --> 13:29.941
to what he wants
or how he likes things done.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.577
He's, like, saying,
"I ran a tight ship.

13:32.579 --> 13:36.180
I ran a tight ship,
and that's what I expect."

13:36.182 --> 13:39.417
It's weird because, you know,
one thing is,

13:39.419 --> 13:42.453
is like being influenced
with his, like --

13:42.455 --> 13:44.054
we'll just call it OCD.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.224
They could carry that
to their homes,

13:46.226 --> 13:50.929
and they can't stop themselves,
you know, from doing it.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.730
Okay, so what's
going on here?

13:52.732 --> 13:55.567
I feel like I have something
influencing me,

13:55.569 --> 13:58.002
will cause me
to make decisions

13:58.004 --> 14:00.938
that later I really have
no recollection of.
Okay.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.940
So give me an example
of what you're talking about.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.942
I have a car crusher,
and, honestly,

14:04.944 --> 14:07.478
I didn't really even remember
doing much of that.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.746
Next thing you know,
I've got a car crusher,

14:08.748 --> 14:10.215
and we're crushing cars.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.317
I don't know where that idea
really came from.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.684
So, you're telling me

14:13.686 --> 14:16.153
you bought a huge,
expensive piece of equipment,

14:16.155 --> 14:18.690
but you don't remember
doing it?-

14:18.692 --> 14:20.458
Well, that's a first.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.427
All right, so any
other experiences
you can tell me about?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.362
We have things
that get moved

14:24.364 --> 14:26.764
quite often
just on their own.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.700
Okay, so give me
an example of what
we're talking about.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.303
Anything
from small hand tools,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.706
welders moving,
cars moving,

14:34.708 --> 14:37.575
900- to 1,000-pound
tires rolling.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.510
That can be
seriously dangerous.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.712
Now, anything else physical
like that happen to you?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.649
I had an experience where I was
sitting in my office,

14:44.651 --> 14:47.251
and I had felt
as if somebody

14:47.253 --> 14:49.320
had reached
through my back --

14:49.322 --> 14:52.757
as if somebody was grabbing
my spine and twisting it.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.926
I felt really bad
after that.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.261
You know, your wife was
describing something similar.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.131
If my partner says to you,
"You got to go.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.133
You can't fix it,"
what would you do?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.535
If somebody had asked me
that about year or two ago,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.804
I would've said
there's no way I would do it,

15:06.806 --> 15:09.006
but the way things are now --
and I'm really fearful

15:09.008 --> 15:10.475
for my son
and my wife's safety,

15:10.477 --> 15:12.209
and my own
at the same time --

15:12.211 --> 15:13.878
but, yeah,
I would leave.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.884
The older dude
lays down the law,

15:19.886 --> 15:22.120
you know, with everybody.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.355
I think he gets physical
with people.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.826
If he gets physical
with somebody,

15:28.828 --> 15:30.628
you're gonna feel it
for a while.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.563
Like, it's not
just gonna go away,

15:32.565 --> 15:34.899
and it's weird
because he doesn't think

15:34.901 --> 15:39.237
that that's a bad thing
'cause back in his day,

15:39.239 --> 15:41.839
that was completely
appropriate behavior.

15:43.042 --> 15:47.911
Oof.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.247
What the hell?

15:49.249 --> 15:54.585
He, like, pushed me,
and then now it feels

15:54.587 --> 15:58.122
like my upper spine is,
like...

15:58.124 --> 15:59.791
breaking.

15:59.793 --> 16:04.295
My back, my back
hurts now a lot.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.464
God.
I feel so sick.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.330
Jamie told me a former owner
died on the property,

16:23.332 --> 16:26.133
so I called a local detective,
who says she's right.

16:26.135 --> 16:27.868
Not only that, she knew the guy.

16:27.870 --> 16:30.104
She says this guy's death
was a freak accident

16:30.106 --> 16:32.373
that never should've happened.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.879
Kelly, thanks for helping me
out with this case.

16:38.881 --> 16:40.214
I appreciate that.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.582
So I know you knew
the guy, John,

16:41.584 --> 16:43.050
that died
on my clients' property.

16:43.052 --> 16:44.318
What did you know
about him?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.720
His name
was John Swigert,

16:45.722 --> 16:48.389
and he owned a towing company
and ran an auto shop

16:48.391 --> 16:51.325
that was on the property
that your clients bought.

16:51.327 --> 16:52.994
So, Kelly,
how did you know John?

16:52.996 --> 16:55.463
Swigert's collision
had a tow contract

16:55.465 --> 16:57.898
with the City of Oregon
Police Department.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.734
Did you know anything
about him, like, what
kind of guy he was?

16:59.736 --> 17:01.703
He was kind of
a no-nonsense guy.

17:01.705 --> 17:04.003
He didn't take any BS
from anyone,

17:04.006 --> 17:06.808
and he was in the Army
in the Korean War,

17:06.810 --> 17:08.876
and it kind of came out
in his personality.

17:08.877 --> 17:11.279
It was not uncommon for us
to get called to the shop

17:11.281 --> 17:13.848
for him having a disagreement
with one of his patrons.

17:13.849 --> 17:14.915
What kind of disagreement,
like --

17:14.917 --> 17:16.517
Typically, he would just
get in arguments

17:16.519 --> 17:18.586
if they didn't have
enough money to pay.

17:18.588 --> 17:20.320
He just wasn't
gonna back down.

17:20.323 --> 17:22.990
So, Kelly, do you
have any idea when he
acquired the property?

17:22.992 --> 17:25.460
He bought the property
back in 1973,

17:25.462 --> 17:29.530
and I actually have a few photos
here from that era.

17:29.532 --> 17:31.999
All right, so I know
he dies on the property.

17:32.001 --> 17:34.569
Yeah.
It was July 21st, 2005.

17:34.571 --> 17:36.737
John was in the process
of moving a motorcycle

17:36.739 --> 17:39.339
from his tow truck
to a flatbed trailer,

17:39.341 --> 17:41.675
and it seems as though
the tow truck crept back

17:41.677 --> 17:45.146
and pinned him in between
the truck and the trailer.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.482
It compressed him,
and he suffocated.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.817
We actually had a detective
do an investigation,

17:49.819 --> 17:51.953
and here is a copy
of that report.

17:54.023 --> 17:56.157
Was there any indication that
he might have been drinking,

17:56.159 --> 17:58.492
any drugs in his system,
anything like that?

17:58.494 --> 18:01.095
According to his son, he had
been sober for about a decade,

18:01.097 --> 18:03.164
and according to
the autopsy report,

18:03.166 --> 18:05.899
there was no signs
of alcohol in his system.

18:05.901 --> 18:06.968
Did they ever figure out

18:06.970 --> 18:08.436
if there was anything wrong
with the truck?

18:08.438 --> 18:10.905
Like, did it have a malfunction,
anything like that?

18:10.907 --> 18:12.840
Well, we tested the truck
several times

18:12.842 --> 18:14.375
to try to replicate
the accident,

18:14.377 --> 18:18.178
and didn't find any
mechanical problems with it.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.713
What a horrible way
to go.

18:23.453 --> 18:27.722
This older dude, I think he
feels pretty comfortable here.

18:27.724 --> 18:31.325
I would say that he was here
at some point

18:31.327 --> 18:34.962
'cause he feels
like he owns all this.

18:34.964 --> 18:39.466
He is very tough
and lays down the law,

18:39.468 --> 18:41.803
you know, with everybody.

18:41.805 --> 18:46.407
He's, like, very organized,
got rules and regulations

18:46.409 --> 18:50.978
about how things
are supposed to be.

18:50.980 --> 18:56.551
I think he was military --
former military.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.820
Do you have any idea
how he died?

18:58.822 --> 19:02.523
I feel like
a car accident.

19:02.525 --> 19:06.694
I got somebody with a broken
back, and it seems recent.

19:06.696 --> 19:08.863
He also hurt my back.

19:08.865 --> 19:12.033
I think he kind of did that
to get me to leave.

19:17.172 --> 19:20.775
So far, I've got a family under
attack by paranormal activity

19:20.777 --> 19:22.843
on a property where
the former owner died

19:22.845 --> 19:24.645
in a mysterious accident,

19:24.647 --> 19:28.049
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

19:28.051 --> 19:31.252
Searching through old records,
I come across Joe Urbaytis.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.520
Turns out, he was
a notorious mobster

19:33.522 --> 19:36.390
who was murdered under
mysterious circumstances.

19:40.196 --> 19:41.862
So I'm headed over to meet
a local author

19:41.864 --> 19:43.730
who's written all
about this gangster.

19:43.732 --> 19:46.601
Now, he says this guy's life
could've been made into a movie,

19:46.603 --> 19:48.402
and his death happened
right across the street

19:48.404 --> 19:50.604
from my clients' property.

19:56.546 --> 19:58.412
So, Lou, thanks for
meeting with me here.
I appreciate that.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.480
Now, you mentioned on the phone
that this guy's life

20:00.482 --> 20:02.216
could've been made into a movie.
What did you mean by that?

20:02.218 --> 20:06.020
Well, Joe Urbaytis
is a colorful, charismatic,

20:06.022 --> 20:08.055
locally-famous gangster.
Okay.

20:08.057 --> 20:11.358
He ran an illegal speakeasy
and a gambling club

20:11.360 --> 20:13.494
not too far from
your clients' property.

20:13.496 --> 20:14.829
So how does he
become famous?

20:14.831 --> 20:18.832
In 1921, he and his gang
led the biggest heist

20:18.834 --> 20:20.701
ever in the city
of Toledo's history.

20:20.703 --> 20:22.102
Okay,
so what happened?

20:22.104 --> 20:24.571
They follow a mail truck
over to the old post office,

20:24.573 --> 20:26.707
and they pull off
a mail robbery

20:26.709 --> 20:30.244
of cash, bonds, and securities
worth about $1 million,

20:30.246 --> 20:33.381
or in today's dollars,
probably over $13 million.

20:33.383 --> 20:35.215
So that's
a big score for them.
Yeah.

20:35.217 --> 20:37.484
He gets caught
a few days later.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.520
Three years later,
he stands trial,

20:39.522 --> 20:40.955
and he's convicted.

20:40.957 --> 20:45.693
He's sent off to Atlanta
Federal Prison for 60 years.

20:45.695 --> 20:47.328
But I know he gets out.
How does he get out?

20:47.330 --> 20:50.998
Well, long story short, they had
filed an appeal on his case,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.401
and so the appeal
is successful.

20:53.403 --> 20:55.069
1943, he's out.

20:55.071 --> 20:57.338
He's back on the
streets again.
What does he do?

20:57.340 --> 21:00.174
He opens this illegal
gambling parlor,

21:00.176 --> 21:01.309
Bon Aire Supper Club,

21:01.311 --> 21:03.344
not far from
your clients' property.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.212
So, I know this guy gets
whacked. What happened?

21:05.214 --> 21:09.950
Well, it happened early
on November the 5th, 1946.

21:09.952 --> 21:12.219
He's in the Bon Aire Supper Club
early in the morning,

21:12.221 --> 21:14.689
goes to answer the door,
goes to the rear entrance,

21:14.691 --> 21:16.490
and somebody comes up
and shoots him --

21:16.492 --> 21:17.691
plugs him twice.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.694
Heart, lung --
he's lying there.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.495
He's gasping for breath.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.164
People run over to try
to talk to him,

21:23.166 --> 21:24.832
to say,
"Who did this?"

21:24.834 --> 21:26.967
Mobster's code,
he's not giving it up.

21:26.969 --> 21:28.436
He takes the secret
to his grave.

21:28.438 --> 21:31.439
He knows who did it,
but he's not saying a word.

21:31.441 --> 21:34.842
A few minutes later,
he dies at the age of 47.

21:34.844 --> 21:36.910
There are still
lots of questions

21:36.912 --> 21:38.479
that revolve
around this thing.

21:38.481 --> 21:40.547
Nobody knows exactly
what happened.

21:47.123 --> 21:49.990
I'm getting a guy
running up to me,

21:49.992 --> 21:53.661
seems to be white,
probably in his 30s.

21:53.663 --> 21:56.797
He's from, like,
maybe the '30s or '40s.

21:56.799 --> 22:01.535
I don't know if this guy
knows he's dead.

22:01.537 --> 22:04.738
He's freaking out.
He wants to get out of here.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.240
He needs help.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.676
He was involved
in a bad situation,

22:09.678 --> 22:15.382
was involved
in some kind of a shooting.

22:15.384 --> 22:21.222
I am seeing a shotgun,
and I got that it's a murder.

22:21.224 --> 22:24.892
He's a mess, like, physically,

22:24.894 --> 22:28.896
and then somebody was talking
about a post office.

22:28.898 --> 22:32.700
There's a woman crying
because somebody died.

22:32.702 --> 22:36.036
The woman keeps saying, "He
didn't have to die like that."

22:44.413 --> 22:46.380

23:03.449 --> 23:05.716
You know, another thing caught
my attention in research.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.385
Back in the 1920s,
there was a huge explosion

23:08.387 --> 23:10.721
right down the road
from Jamie and Brian's property.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.823
The historian I'm headed
over to meet says

23:12.825 --> 23:16.326
it's still one of the worst
tragedies in the town's history.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.367
Well, Meg, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.868
Now, this explosion
that happened

23:24.870 --> 23:26.736
near my clients' property,
what do you know about it?

23:26.738 --> 23:29.473
It happened at
the Sun Oil Refinery.

23:29.475 --> 23:32.877
Your clients' property
was about 3,000 feet away,

23:32.879 --> 23:36.280
and the explosion happened
about 7:15 on Sunday,

23:36.282 --> 23:39.350
February 27th, 1928.

23:39.352 --> 23:41.485
All right, so what happened
with this explosion?

23:41.487 --> 23:42.887
What started everything?

23:42.889 --> 23:47.524
A fire started under one of
the tankers at this refinery.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.693
All of the sudden,
it exploded,

23:49.695 --> 23:53.697
and it blew 75 feet
in the air.

23:53.699 --> 23:57.401
Within minutes,
half the refinery is on fire.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.569
Okay, so this is
a pretty big explosion?
Yes.

23:59.571 --> 24:02.439
What about
my clients' property?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.907
Would they
have felt anything?

24:03.909 --> 24:06.643
They certainly would've felt
the impact.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.879
You know, they might have felt
a physical shake.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.182
Okay, so they might have even
thought there was an earthquake?

24:11.184 --> 24:15.819
They would've seen
not only the fire,

24:15.821 --> 24:17.120
but they would've seen
their neighbors

24:17.122 --> 24:20.124
coming by to find out
what was happening.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.727
Hundreds of people
gathered to watch this fire.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.929
Now, I know this explosion
was deadly,

24:25.931 --> 24:29.065
but what are we talking about
as far as casualties go?

24:29.067 --> 24:32.469
Well, three men were killed,
and two others were injured,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.004
and I've got the death
certificates here

24:34.006 --> 24:35.973
of the men
who were killed.

24:35.975 --> 24:40.644
It looks like
they all died from burns.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.146
Anything stand out
about any of the victims?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.216
Yes. Earl Miller.

24:45.218 --> 24:48.018
He was 39.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.487
The strange thing
about his story is,

24:50.489 --> 24:54.692
he was found maybe a half mile
from the refinery.

24:54.694 --> 24:58.028
He was wandering,
he was dazed, he was confused,

24:58.030 --> 25:00.831
and he was badly burned.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.833
He actually went
to the hospital,

25:02.835 --> 25:05.035
but he couldn't survive.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.504
He died
a couple days later.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.907
Okay, so any wrongful death
lawsuits or negligence

25:09.909 --> 25:11.508
against the company?
No.

25:11.510 --> 25:16.580
The company was absolved
of any guilt in the case at all.

25:16.582 --> 25:20.116
They're still operating
as a refinery on that location.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.786
It was a pretty
tragic story.
It was awful.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.488
I just can't imagine.

25:28.594 --> 25:33.230
Something very <i> bad</i>
happened here.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.366
It's just terrible.

25:37.670 --> 25:44.174
I saw a bunch of people
running around yelling.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.076
Do you have any idea
what happened to these people?

25:46.078 --> 25:48.078
I am seeing a fire.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.547
Like, at least 10 people died.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.050
I'm seeing
all this black stuff.
What do you mean?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.954
I couldn't tell
if it was charcoal or, like,

25:56.956 --> 25:58.956
wood that had been burnt.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.258
And there was an explosion.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.528
I got a man on fire.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.631
He's kind of, like,
burnt and glowing

26:07.633 --> 26:10.167
and is currently still on fire.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.713
I saw several horrifying things
during my walk,

26:22.715 --> 26:25.649
but the dead, old man attacking
a living person

26:25.651 --> 26:27.885
has me the most concerned.

26:27.887 --> 26:31.388
Probably late 60s,
early 70s.

26:31.390 --> 26:34.124
He's wearing, like,
some kind of a uniform

26:34.126 --> 26:35.992
that buttons down
the front.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.061
It's dirty.

26:38.063 --> 26:41.999
He's probably some
kind of mechanic.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.736
He is lunging
at a living male.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.178
Amy, is this
what you saw?

26:55.180 --> 26:57.748
Yes,
that's what I saw.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.370
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:20.372 --> 27:22.840
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:22.842 --> 27:25.109
and our clients
for the first time.

27:25.111 --> 27:28.512
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Jamie and her husband, Brian.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.814
As you might have guessed, they
run a couple of businesses here,

27:30.816 --> 27:33.117
so they get to be here
together all day long

27:33.119 --> 27:35.853
and bring their 4-year-old son,
Brody, to work with them.

27:35.855 --> 27:39.656
I got a photo of Brody
right here.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.526
Now, the trouble is,
the activity is getting
pretty violent here,

27:42.528 --> 27:44.962
and they're afraid somebody's
gonna get seriously hurt.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.964
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

27:46.966 --> 27:48.932
I'm gonna to ask her
to describe her walk for us.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.539
First thing I want to talk about
is something strange

27:55.541 --> 27:57.474
I saw around the garages.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.943
There's this guy, like,
running up to me,

27:59.945 --> 28:01.778
freaking out, moving weird,

28:01.780 --> 28:03.747
you know,
yelling and screaming --

28:03.749 --> 28:08.085
seemed very confused,
very upset.

28:08.087 --> 28:11.354
He was white,
probably in his 30s.

28:11.356 --> 28:15.626
He was involved in some kind
of shooting or murder.

28:15.628 --> 28:19.629
I got that there was a shotgun
and that somebody died.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.832
There was also some kind of
weird connection

28:21.834 --> 28:26.703
with him and a post office.

28:26.705 --> 28:31.374
I glanced to the side of him,
and I see a woman,

28:31.376 --> 28:34.545
and she's crying, and she's
saying over and over again,

28:34.547 --> 28:36.914
"He didn't have to die
like this."

28:36.916 --> 28:38.415
A lot of things
she was saying reminds me

28:38.417 --> 28:39.583
of a pretty
interesting story

28:39.585 --> 28:41.384
I came across
during my research.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.720
Back in the 1920s,
there was a well-known gangster

28:43.722 --> 28:47.858
in the neighborhood
by the name Joe Urbaytis.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.526
Well, Urbaytis was 21,

28:49.528 --> 28:51.595
and he led a gang that pulled
off the biggest heist

28:51.597 --> 28:53.396
in Toledo history
at the time.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.733
Now, get this -- They did it
by robbing the post office.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.668
So they arrest him.

28:58.670 --> 29:04.707
Somehow this guy won an appeal
and was released in 1943.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.510
Urbaytis wound up
coming back into town,

29:06.512 --> 29:08.311
and he opened up
a gambling parlor

29:08.313 --> 29:09.746
right across the street
from here.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.381
So now, in the early
morning hours

29:11.383 --> 29:13.283
of November 5th, 1946,

29:13.285 --> 29:15.818
he answers a knock
on the back door.

29:15.820 --> 29:18.288
He opens it,
and he gets shot twice.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.556
He died
a few minutes later,

29:19.558 --> 29:21.458
and he was 47 years old
at the time of his death.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.659
Man.

29:22.661 --> 29:28.165
And I got mugshots of our guy
when he was younger

29:28.167 --> 29:32.135
and then
when he was older.

29:32.137 --> 29:35.038
Is it possible that this is
the guy that you ran into?

29:35.040 --> 29:36.673
Yes.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.843
Wow.
Haven't heard of any of this.

29:39.845 --> 29:44.915
Last week, our son, Brody,
was in the office with his dad.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.984
And he told me
he was just talking to him.

29:47.986 --> 29:50.787
He said he was talking
about Joe.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.856
Wow.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.223
All right,
so this gangster,

29:54.225 --> 29:56.059
does he do
anything to these guys?

29:56.061 --> 29:57.093
Yes.

29:57.095 --> 30:01.064
There were some things
that he does,

30:01.066 --> 30:05.135
possibly hearing him
yelling and screaming.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.137
Then he can move things.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.007
Well, Brian spoke to me about
stuff moving in the garage.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.677
I was painting monster truck
tires and wheels.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.479
They're 6 feet tall
Yeah, I saw those, yeah.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.880
They're big tires.

30:16.882 --> 30:19.482
And all of the sudden,
one of tires just took off,

30:19.484 --> 30:21.752
and they weigh 900,
1,000 pounds.

30:21.754 --> 30:23.253
There's nobody there.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.689
So you can understand
why it's so dangerous

30:25.691 --> 30:27.424
for Brody to be here.
Yeah.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.558
Like, if that
had rolled --

30:28.560 --> 30:30.394
He'd be crushed to death.

30:30.396 --> 30:33.596
It just makes me
scared for him.

30:33.598 --> 30:35.265
It makes life
miserable.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.337
All right, what else?

30:40.339 --> 30:44.775
There's two organized groups
of dead people.

30:44.777 --> 30:49.345
The first group
were the outsiders.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.448
They come and go out
of the second garage,

30:52.450 --> 30:54.784
and that's kind
of their territory, all right?

30:54.786 --> 30:56.920
So they're,
like, very confused.

30:56.922 --> 30:59.422
They're extremely
depressed.

30:59.424 --> 31:05.062
Each of them died
in a very traumatic manner.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.930
I got accidents,
I got shooting,

31:07.932 --> 31:10.700
some suicide
or something.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.169
So, I don't know if you realize
or noticed,

31:12.171 --> 31:15.305
but one of the businesses
they have is a towing company.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.607
Now, he's got a contract
with the police department,

31:17.609 --> 31:19.743
so, basically,
you've got cars out there

31:19.745 --> 31:22.612
that would've had dead bodies
in them at some point

31:22.614 --> 31:25.548
or caused a fatal accident.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.217
Yeah, there's more than
I can count since
we've been there.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.353
Most of them
are looking for help.

31:30.355 --> 31:34.157
You may feel their emotions,
which is confusion, chaos,

31:34.159 --> 31:37.561
depression, fear, panic,

31:37.563 --> 31:41.431
and these can come on
because they're around you.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.368
The last few years, I have
just horrific depression --

31:44.370 --> 31:47.103
like...just horrible.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.439
Like, I feel like
it's the end of the world.

31:49.441 --> 31:53.277
Do you feel better when
you're away from the location?

31:53.279 --> 31:56.113
As soon as I lock the door,
and I'm in my truck,

31:56.115 --> 31:57.848
that starts to dissipate.

31:57.850 --> 32:00.783
Interesting.
So here's the thing.

32:00.785 --> 32:03.920
This is happening to you because
you're a physical medium.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.390
- Is this for real right now?
- Yeah.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.058
The dead love you.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.527
You know, they're gonna
be going to you.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.796
They're gonna be,
you know, attaching.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.064
They're gonna
be following.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.099
You're gonna have
these experiences,

32:16.101 --> 32:18.669
and your son,
he's a medium, too.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.476
You okay?

32:34.953 --> 32:38.888
So let's get on to
the second group of people --

32:38.890 --> 32:40.623
the inside people.

32:40.625 --> 32:45.228
They try to keep
the outsiders outside.

32:45.230 --> 32:49.766
There's constant fights going
on between these two groups.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.067
Remember you mentioned
you saw a guy

32:51.069 --> 32:53.169
with his fist clenched?

32:53.171 --> 32:54.437
Tell Amy what you saw
'cause I'm wondering

32:54.439 --> 32:56.673
if this is one
of the guys fighting.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.374
We walked in the office,

32:58.376 --> 33:01.178
and there was a male
standing there, tall,

33:01.180 --> 33:05.515
tall as Brian, clenched fists,
and I jumped back

33:05.517 --> 33:10.921
because I legitimately thought
we were about to be hurt.

33:10.923 --> 33:12.656
While they're fighting,

33:12.658 --> 33:17.794
you could suddenly feel
a lot of stress,

33:17.796 --> 33:21.931
but the biggest emotion
would be, like, sudden rage,

33:21.933 --> 33:24.834
flying off the handle
at each other,

33:24.836 --> 33:28.138
not really understanding
why you're feeling this way.

33:28.140 --> 33:31.073
Yeah, I will be perfectly fine,
and all of a sudden,

33:31.075 --> 33:33.042
something will
just flip my switch,

33:33.044 --> 33:35.078
and I'm so angry,

33:35.080 --> 33:37.080
I mean, I feel like I could
rip something apart.

33:37.082 --> 33:39.883
It'll just be normal,
everything's great,

33:39.885 --> 33:42.285
and it'll be
something minor,

33:42.287 --> 33:48.258
and I just scream at the top
of my lungs and blow my top.

33:48.260 --> 33:52.094
I'm afraid to ask,
is there more?
Yes.

33:52.096 --> 33:54.965
There's an older, dead man
here I'm worried about.

33:54.967 --> 33:58.701
So, this guy
is kind of, like, the leader

33:58.703 --> 34:02.371
of the indoor dead group.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.507
He's, like,
in his 60s or 70s.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.777
He seemed to be
extremely meticulous,

34:07.779 --> 34:10.746
possibly military,
very old school,

34:10.748 --> 34:15.051
very authoritative,
controlling.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.822
I felt like he used
to own the property.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.724
I'm pretty sure I know
who you're talking about

34:20.726 --> 34:21.925
or who you saw.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.728
I'm guessing these two do,
as well.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.329
So one of the guys that --

34:26.331 --> 34:28.732
who owned this place
before these two took over

34:28.734 --> 34:30.800
was a guy named John Swigert.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.402
He owned the towing company on
the property for about 32 years.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.739
The guy you saw,
you said was in the military.

34:35.741 --> 34:40.643
Well, Swigert served in the
U.S. Army during the Korean War.

34:40.645 --> 34:44.080
You mentioned your guy was
authoritative and controlling.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.748
Now, the detective I spoke
to knew Swigert

34:46.751 --> 34:49.686
and said he was
a no-nonsense guy.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.521
He used to actually
get into fights with people

34:51.523 --> 34:54.724
who try to get
their cars back without paying.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.527
In July of 2005, he was
transferring a motorcycle

34:57.529 --> 35:00.897
from the back of a tow truck
to another truck.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.366
The tow truck started
to creep back on him.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.235
By the time Swigert noticed,
it was too late,

35:05.237 --> 35:07.304
and he was pinned
between the two trucks.

35:09.241 --> 35:12.509
And he got crushed and wound
up suffocating to death,

35:12.511 --> 35:15.278
and I got
the police accident report,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.547
but the conclusion
of the investigation,

35:17.549 --> 35:19.416
they were never able
to figure out

35:19.418 --> 35:22.452
what made that truck
move back onto Swigert.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.853
And I got a photo of him.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.155
You said it was
the former owner.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.857
Do you think Swigert's
the guy you saw?
Yes.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.125
Now, let me
ask you something.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.427
Would they have experiences
with this guy?

35:31.429 --> 35:34.664
Yes, you would.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.802
He was the most powerful
deceased individual

35:38.804 --> 35:40.337
on the property.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.807
I got a lot
of anxiety from him.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.876
I felt dizzy and sick
and nauseous from him.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.446
Now, she talked about anxiety.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.013
Both of you have
experienced that.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.749
It's all the time.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.217
You're just
always on edge.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.819
It's like you're walking
on eggshells or glass.

35:56.821 --> 36:00.657
Like, you're just
always anticipating...

36:00.659 --> 36:03.426
Doom.
Like -- yes!
Exactly.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.094
You suffer from headaches
and stuff, too, right?

36:05.096 --> 36:06.296
Extreme.

36:06.298 --> 36:10.367
It gets to the point
where I literally am ill.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.703
I can't eat, I can't talk,
I can't focus.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.838
The biggest thing
that I didn't like

36:15.840 --> 36:19.442
is his influence
over the living.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.444
He thinks
he's still the boss.

36:21.446 --> 36:24.114
He wants things
done his way,

36:24.116 --> 36:30.920
and he will influence you
to make his way happen.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.389
We talked about you
being influenced

36:32.391 --> 36:35.257
and doing stuff at the garage
that you wouldn't do, right?

36:35.259 --> 36:37.293
Yes.
I bought a car crusher

36:37.295 --> 36:39.329
and a front-end loader
to crush cars,

36:39.331 --> 36:41.030
and then at the end of that,
I kind of thought,

36:41.032 --> 36:42.131
"Why in the world
did I do this?"

36:42.133 --> 36:43.733
"Why did I do this?"

36:43.735 --> 36:45.135
Like, some of the things,
I thought,

36:45.137 --> 36:47.637
maybe the living suddenly
would have, like,

36:47.639 --> 36:50.206
this obsession
with being organized,

36:50.208 --> 36:55.445
and you might bring these
OCD tendencies home.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.180
Can he do that to Brody?

36:57.182 --> 36:58.815
Yeah.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.183
Brody is extremely
meticulous.

37:01.185 --> 37:03.719
He's always
been that way.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.755
So, he's been influenced,
basically, his whole life?

37:07.092 --> 37:09.225
Yeah, that's crazy.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.027
Can this guy
do anything else?

37:11.029 --> 37:13.896
What he likes to do
is get physical.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.165
What the hell?

37:15.167 --> 37:20.503
And he, like, pushed me,
and then now it feels

37:20.505 --> 37:24.040
like my upper spine is,
like...

37:24.042 --> 37:25.608
breaking.

37:25.610 --> 37:31.581
And I saw him doing this
to somebody in the garage,

37:31.583 --> 37:33.850
and I did have a sketch
done of that.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.691
Well, you're not going to
like this.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.332
Now I'm scared.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.934
So, Brian, do me a favor
and explain to Amy

37:51.936 --> 37:54.871
what happened to you
when you were attacked.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.340
It felt like something reached
in and grabbed my spine

37:57.342 --> 37:59.809
and was twisting it
until I literally had pain

37:59.811 --> 38:01.244
all the way down.

38:01.246 --> 38:04.414
Now, didn't you suffer
from a similar pain?

38:04.416 --> 38:06.749
Yes, I felt as if someone
grabbed me

38:06.751 --> 38:10.353
by the back of the neck
and just squeezed and squeezed.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.922
He's got
a short temper.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.990
If you're not doing
what he wants,

38:14.992 --> 38:16.926
he's gonna
physically hurt you

38:16.928 --> 38:19.095
or try
and make you sick.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.364
You've had ongoing
health issues.

38:21.366 --> 38:24.768
Several, and, I mean, it's just
been one thing after another.

38:24.770 --> 38:28.605
Now, is this all Swigert, or is
this because he's a medium?

38:28.607 --> 38:31.074
It's both.
Yeah, let's just say,

38:31.076 --> 38:35.812
this is not
a good situation for anybody,

38:35.814 --> 38:39.449
and then you have a kid
who's a medium, too,

38:39.451 --> 38:43.753
in an extraordinarily
active environment.

38:43.755 --> 38:47.157
Definitely not a good situation
for him to be in.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.059
We love it here.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.595
Brody loves it here.

38:52.597 --> 38:55.598
I love it, but it's
dangerous, apparently,

38:55.600 --> 38:58.201
and I don't want any of us
to be hurt,

38:58.203 --> 38:59.902
especially my son.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.871
It's a scary thing being
a physical medium

39:01.873 --> 39:04.340
'cause you can die
very early.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.476
Kind of scared.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.215
You okay, honey?

39:30.435 --> 39:33.202
So, Jamie, Brian,
you got a lot going on here,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.738
and, obviously,
it dangerous.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.407
Now it's time to answer
the big question --

39:37.409 --> 39:39.208
Is there a way to stop
the activity

39:39.210 --> 39:41.811
and keep you guys
and Brody safe,

39:41.813 --> 39:44.881
or do you need to get the hell
out of here while you still can?

39:44.883 --> 39:47.216
For that question, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.156
So, the first thing
I would like you to do

39:53.158 --> 39:56.859
is to get a medium
and a psychic knower

39:56.861 --> 40:00.296
to come and move these two
groups of deceased people on.

40:00.298 --> 40:01.864
They need to go.

40:01.866 --> 40:05.401
The medium will engage
and move the dead people

40:05.403 --> 40:07.503
with the help
of the psychic.

40:07.505 --> 40:10.807
Is that gonna include Swigert
and our dead gangster?

40:10.809 --> 40:13.743
Yes.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.145
Will that stop the depression,
the rage?

40:16.147 --> 40:17.780
- Yeah.
- All the physical attacks?

40:17.782 --> 40:21.016
Well, yeah,
that's gonna go.

40:21.018 --> 40:23.786
The next thing, with you being
a physical medium --

40:23.788 --> 40:26.188
for your safety,
you need to set boundaries

40:26.190 --> 40:28.458
that work for the dead
and mean it.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.693
So state these things
out loud --

40:30.695 --> 40:33.996
"You are only allowed to come
to me in the office

40:33.998 --> 40:39.002
and in the garage
once per week for 2 hours."

40:39.004 --> 40:40.203
So, there you go.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.537
It's just a matter of dealing
with the dead

40:41.539 --> 40:43.539
the way you're dealing
with the living.

40:43.541 --> 40:46.409
Then the last thing
I want you guys to do

40:46.411 --> 40:51.681
is to start looking for books
for protection meditations.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.049
You're gonna find meditation

40:53.051 --> 40:56.920
becomes your saving grace
with this ability,

40:56.922 --> 41:00.323
and it's also something
your son's going to have
to learn eventually.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.025
Now what about Brody?

41:02.027 --> 41:03.893
Does he need to stay away
from here?

41:03.895 --> 41:05.160
Temporarily.

41:05.162 --> 41:07.697
Once this is all settled
and situated,

41:07.699 --> 41:11.000
he can come back here.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.702
Well, now you know
what's got to be done.

41:12.704 --> 41:13.969
Are you gonna do this?

41:13.971 --> 41:16.973
- Not even a question.
- We'll do it.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.441
You keep the business you love,
and you keep your son safe.

41:19.443 --> 41:22.178
- That's all we want.
- That's all we care about.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.814
I actually have an overwhelming
sense of relief.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.050
You guys are even more
amazing than we'd hoped for.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.185
Well, we appreciate that.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.256
Jamie and Brian have
their work cut out for them,

41:34.258 --> 41:37.393
but if they bring in
a medium and a psychic knower

41:37.395 --> 41:39.461
to remove the dangerous dead,

41:39.463 --> 41:42.531
and Brian and Brody learn
how to harness their abilities,

41:42.533 --> 41:45.802
this family will finally
find the peace it deserves.
