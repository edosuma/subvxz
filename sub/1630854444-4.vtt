WEBVTT

00:38.791 --> 00:41.375
That's not right.
We shouldn't be doing this.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.458
He's been dead two days.
I don't think he'll mind.

00:44.875 --> 00:48.500
What if they find us? Know what they do
to soldiers who desert the Legion?

00:48.583 --> 00:50.208
We haven't got messages for weeks.

00:51.291 --> 00:53.333
They probably don't know
we're still alive.

00:55.041 --> 00:58.000
With this fucking idiot dead,
there's no one to give me commands.

00:59.541 --> 01:01.791
The supply troops
should've been here days ago.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.458
I'm not going to starve here
and end up like this idiot.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.291
Jérôme.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.458
This will work.

01:09.541 --> 01:10.750
I promise.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.583
It's a seven-day walk
to the next military post.

01:14.666 --> 01:18.291
I'm a wounded lieutenant,
and you're the hero who saved me.

01:18.875 --> 01:19.875
And that's it.

01:20.916 --> 01:23.333
Hey. They will send us back home.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.541
It's either that or die out here.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.625
Come back to reality, my friend.

01:30.125 --> 01:31.458
Help me.

01:32.416 --> 01:34.625
-Stop!
-What?

01:34.708 --> 01:36.833
The supply troops
will be here any day now.

01:37.666 --> 01:39.750
We shouldn't be doing this.

01:51.583 --> 01:52.625
You're right.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.541
I'm sorry.

01:59.875 --> 02:00.958
You're right.

02:01.958 --> 02:03.625
What was I thinking, my friend?

02:07.958 --> 02:09.250
What was I thinking?

02:18.708 --> 02:20.291
Are you all right?

02:22.750 --> 02:23.750
Easy.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.666
Calm down. Everything is all right.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.500
Franz, that is mutiny. You can't do that.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.250
Get up.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.583
Let's go.

02:57.458 --> 02:58.458
You too.

03:01.375 --> 03:02.458
Franz!

03:02.541 --> 03:04.375
What is this? What are you planning?

03:08.541 --> 03:09.541
Let me out of here!

03:09.625 --> 03:10.833
Franz!

03:26.375 --> 03:27.958
Throw them overboard!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.958
Who knows what they died of.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.541
Olek! I said throw them overboard.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.166
Come on!

03:49.958 --> 03:52.083
Same for you too.

05:27.791 --> 05:29.458
I'll go to the right!

05:29.541 --> 05:30.416
Clear the corridors.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.791
Keep walking. Do as I say! Come on.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.125
Please.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.333
Get in!

05:35.416 --> 05:36.416
Leave me alone.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.583
Let go of me!

05:59.208 --> 06:00.416
Keep going.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.083
Go. Go. Go. Go.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.208
Did you find her?

06:18.125 --> 06:19.916
We searched the whole horizon.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.125
No sign of the Prometheus.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.791
That's impossible.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.166
She was tied to us.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.958
Maybe she didn't disappear.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.666
Maybe it's us who disappeared.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.541
The compasses are working again.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.583
At our last location,
our bow was facing east.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.208
Now we're facing west.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.041
What does that mean?

06:43.875 --> 06:46.166
Maybe we're not
where we're supposed to be.

06:47.458 --> 06:51.083
I have no idea why, but somehow
we're back in the position we were

06:51.166 --> 06:53.333
when we deviated
from our course three days ago.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.416
Wherever we are,

07:06.416 --> 07:07.791
our destination lies west.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.625
Turn the engine back on.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.416
Full power.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.583
There are new rules on this ship now.

07:27.666 --> 07:29.208
And we want answers.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.458
Why are people dying here?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.833
Tell us right now.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.875
You didn't care about our lives before,

07:41.583 --> 07:43.708
and we don't care about yours now.

07:45.291 --> 07:48.291
This ship will go to America.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.750
With or without your help.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.083
Wait.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.041
There is something you need to know.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.583
The morning we returned
from the Prometheus,

08:11.666 --> 08:13.083
we received a message from…

08:14.416 --> 08:16.166
from the ship company.

08:16.250 --> 08:19.166
Two days ago,
they got a message from the ship company.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.416
It read, "Sink ship."

08:28.416 --> 08:31.250
It said we should sink the ship we found.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.000
I think the ship company
wanted us to sink that ship

08:34.083 --> 08:35.916
so no one would get off it alive.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.666
That boy they brought back.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.416
Since he's been on board,
people have started dying.

08:44.416 --> 08:46.125
That's not a coincidence.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.250
What did he say?

08:49.541 --> 08:50.791
Tove, what did he say?

08:51.750 --> 08:53.791
-The boy they brought back--
-Krester.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.416
He thinks he is causing all the deaths.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.666
The devil dresses as an angel.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.541
Do you believe me now?

09:22.833 --> 09:25.291
The devil is not going to get his way.

09:33.208 --> 09:34.250
Find the boy.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.875
Krester.

09:58.750 --> 09:59.625
You!

10:00.375 --> 10:01.875
Let's go!

10:35.291 --> 10:36.583
What was that?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.250
Think there's something wrong with them?

10:58.458 --> 11:01.125
Maybe this happened
to the passengers on the Prometheus.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.791
And they all died like that.

11:28.625 --> 11:31.958
No. Best to keep your head down.

11:33.708 --> 11:34.875
Do you understand?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.541
Are you all right?

11:57.416 --> 11:58.833
Hey, easy.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.750
Easy.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.416
Tell me the truth.

12:13.416 --> 12:14.833
Where were you last night?

12:16.791 --> 12:17.833
What is that?

12:21.125 --> 12:22.458
As if you cared.

12:23.666 --> 12:25.083
I'm your wife.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.083
And how is that working out for you?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.875
What is wrong with you?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.333
There is a mutiny out there,

12:31.416 --> 12:34.208
and the only thing you're interested in
is finding more ways to hurt me.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.708
Life hurts.

12:38.250 --> 12:42.291
The moment you think you've got it all,
it smacks you in the face.

12:47.708 --> 12:48.916
Want to know what this is?

12:51.458 --> 12:52.875
It's potassium bromide.

12:52.958 --> 12:55.000
It's supposed to help with the seizures.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.916
What seizures?

12:59.083 --> 13:00.916
There is something inside my head.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.416
If I don't take it, I wriggle
on the floor like a fucking lunatic.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.666
And if I take it, I can't get a hard-on.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.958
The truth is, I will die.

13:17.791 --> 13:21.833
I don't have much time left.
Might be only a few days or weeks.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.041
Why didn't you tell me?

13:27.125 --> 13:29.875
Because, frankly, you don't give a fuck
if I'm dead or alive.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.916
How did this get here?

14:05.500 --> 14:08.375
-How did this get here?
-I put it there. I thought it was yours.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.416
Where did you find it?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.791
You're hurting me!

14:21.708 --> 14:23.625
I'm sorry.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.458
We found her
on her way to the captain's quarters.

14:40.666 --> 14:42.166
He's not the captain anymore.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.541
And passengers are supposed to stay
in their cabins.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.750
Take her back. Lock her in.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.916
I don't know if this is a good idea.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.250
I tried to hear His voice.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.083
God's voice.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.000
To guide us through this.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.916
But He doesn't talk to me
like He talks to your mother.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.250
You truly believe Mother?

15:53.833 --> 15:55.500
That the boy is evil.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.416
What if she's right?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.291
What if it's all true?

16:13.333 --> 16:15.083
Maybe God gave you a gift.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.500
Maybe you do carry the light
inside of you.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.083
He told her…

16:28.041 --> 16:29.416
that the devil…

16:32.041 --> 16:34.750
will try to take everything away from us.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.125
We cannot let that happen.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.750
We cannot let that happen.

16:53.125 --> 16:54.125
This is it.

16:57.916 --> 16:58.916
Open it.

17:14.541 --> 17:15.958
No. Step aside!

17:19.916 --> 17:21.750
Hold on!

17:22.708 --> 17:25.416
I'm on your side.
We're all on the same side.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.500
We just want the boy.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.583
Search her.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.708
Krester, search her.

18:08.583 --> 18:09.458
Here's the key.

18:09.541 --> 18:10.958
Open the door.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.500
Where's the boy?

18:44.916 --> 18:45.875
Where's the boy?

18:45.958 --> 18:46.833
Mum.

18:47.708 --> 18:50.541
Mum, the boy isn't here.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Okay?

18:54.916 --> 18:56.833
Search every cabin and lock the doors.

18:56.916 --> 18:59.041
No one goes in or out.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.625
Find the boy.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.708
Where is he?

19:16.125 --> 19:17.166
Lock her in.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.500
No. Jérôme, no.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.375
Don't get us in trouble.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Hey!

22:54.166 --> 22:55.208
He's gone!

22:56.166 --> 22:57.541
He jumped.

22:58.625 --> 22:59.708
Where is he?

22:59.791 --> 23:01.041
There's nothing here.

23:01.125 --> 23:02.333
Try to the left!

23:05.791 --> 23:07.625
-Stop!
-No!

23:39.166 --> 23:40.666
Where is he?

23:41.166 --> 23:42.583
He went this way.

23:46.041 --> 23:47.208
Find him.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.708
Where is the vermin?

24:18.208 --> 24:19.791
What happened to you?

24:22.708 --> 24:24.083
I shouldn't have come here.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.416
You can stay.

24:28.416 --> 24:31.041
I mean, until whoever
is looking for you is gone.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.041
I don't think that's a good idea.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.416
Where are you going?

24:38.875 --> 24:40.166
I've seen it before.

24:41.708 --> 24:44.041
People taking power who don't deserve it.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.208
It never ends well.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.500
I'm going to free the captain.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.458
Jérôme.

25:06.541 --> 25:07.541
I will help you.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.875
The Black man. Where did he go?

25:14.250 --> 25:15.750
Did you help him?

25:17.625 --> 25:18.916
No.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.541
If you're lying…

25:24.000 --> 25:26.208
It's all right. He's on our side.

25:27.916 --> 25:30.291
You have no idea what you've done.

25:30.375 --> 25:33.791
We're sitting on a powder keg
that's about to explode.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.708
There are over 1,500 souls on board.

25:37.791 --> 25:40.500
From God knows
how many different countries.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.750
And you just armed them all.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.541
We have five days before we reach land.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.708
Until then, we give them what they want.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.666
And what's that?

25:56.750 --> 25:58.625
An explanation for why people are dying.

26:02.958 --> 26:03.916
The boy.

26:06.250 --> 26:07.750
Check all cabins!

26:08.250 --> 26:09.125
Hey, you.

26:10.666 --> 26:12.333
Look over here! Where are they?

26:14.875 --> 26:15.791
He's not here.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.708
Open the door!

26:29.166 --> 26:30.625
You're hurting me.

26:30.708 --> 26:31.750
Come out.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.750
Open the door!

26:35.541 --> 26:36.541
Come.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.875
-Open up!
-Over here.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.041
Hey. What's going on here?

27:15.583 --> 27:16.583
What are you looking for?

27:22.166 --> 27:25.416
Hey, no. Put that down.
Krester, tell him to put it back.

27:29.208 --> 27:31.041
Why does he know your name?

27:34.375 --> 27:35.375
Krester?

28:15.166 --> 28:17.458
I wish He would have taken you
instead of Ada.

28:23.583 --> 28:24.583
Let's move on.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.208
Krester.

31:10.041 --> 31:11.166
Find the captain.

31:45.958 --> 31:48.000
We're on your side.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.291
They want to get a lifeboat.

32:20.375 --> 32:22.291
Leave the ship
and take refuge on the Prometheus.

32:23.583 --> 32:25.750
-I will help you.
-Me too.

33:10.791 --> 33:11.916
Clémence?

33:41.375 --> 33:43.291
The boy isn't here either.

33:43.791 --> 33:44.875
Look here.

33:51.625 --> 33:53.166
Lock him in with the others.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.375
-Franz!
-Get out of the way.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.208
I said, get out of the way!

35:29.750 --> 35:30.625
Hey!

35:31.708 --> 35:33.083
Don't even think about it.

35:34.375 --> 35:35.250
Listen.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.291
We just want the boy.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Nothing else.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.541
This isn't right.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.708
Stop!

36:00.791 --> 36:03.000
No! Jérôme! No!

36:04.666 --> 36:06.416
No! No! Jérôme, no!

36:07.666 --> 36:10.541
No! Jérôme, no! No, no, no!

36:11.583 --> 36:13.083
No! Jérôme!

36:23.166 --> 36:24.166
Lucien?

36:24.916 --> 36:26.166
What am I doing here?

36:26.666 --> 36:28.041
Where am I?

36:30.791 --> 36:32.958
I must have hit you harder than I thought.

36:35.291 --> 36:36.500
What is happening?

36:36.583 --> 36:39.583
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

36:40.291 --> 36:41.583
I can't do that.

36:43.708 --> 36:45.333
I can be someone else now.

36:47.958 --> 36:50.166
I'll return to France a different man.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.583
As a lieutenant.

36:52.666 --> 36:53.666
You betrayed me.

36:55.375 --> 36:56.833
We were friends.

37:01.416 --> 37:03.666
Once I reach the post,
I'll tell them where to find you.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.291
I'll tell them you're a deserter.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.875
Who do you think they will believe?

37:11.541 --> 37:12.500
Here, take this.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.625
Take it.

37:19.125 --> 37:20.583
You can trade it in prison.

37:26.791 --> 37:28.000
This isn't real.

37:29.916 --> 37:31.916
Why is this happening again?

37:32.916 --> 37:34.333
I'm sorry, my friend.

37:37.166 --> 37:38.166
I really am.

38:32.916 --> 38:34.041
What are you doing?

38:34.791 --> 38:36.791
Krester, have you gone mad as well?

38:37.833 --> 38:40.083
You can't honestly believe her.

38:40.166 --> 38:43.000
You're willing to sacrifice that boy
for Mother's love?

38:46.833 --> 38:47.833
You know what?

38:48.750 --> 38:51.166
You have to stop blaming us
for what happened to you.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.458
Not everything is about you.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.166
Ada is dead.

38:57.250 --> 38:58.958
More people are dying.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.291
And you're only interested in
your own misery.

39:03.666 --> 39:06.416
Don't do this. Don't take their side.

39:35.708 --> 39:36.958
You're alive.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.708
You have no idea what I've been through
to get on this ship.

39:49.708 --> 39:52.291
I'm not planning to die here.

39:56.458 --> 39:57.916
They are out of control.

39:59.666 --> 40:03.333
And it's up to us to stop them.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.750
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

40:19.916 --> 40:22.666
The devil comes in many disguises.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.083
He is taking what is ours.

40:29.875 --> 40:32.583
Collecting our souls,
just as he did on that other ship.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.875
But we know pain and sacrifice!

40:39.000 --> 40:40.500
It will not break us!

40:44.916 --> 40:46.083
Throw the boy overboard!

41:01.791 --> 41:03.083
We can't let them stop us!

43:06.375 --> 43:07.833
Retreat!

43:10.208 --> 43:11.666
Fall back!

43:19.375 --> 43:20.916
Jérôme!

43:21.500 --> 43:22.416
Let her go!

43:23.416 --> 43:24.916
How did you get here?

43:25.000 --> 43:26.333
How did you find me?

43:28.291 --> 43:29.250
Leave her alone!

43:35.583 --> 43:36.916
Fall back!

43:41.333 --> 43:44.375
Why were you with him?
What did he tell you?

43:44.875 --> 43:47.458
-Don't believe a word he says.
-You know him?

44:36.750 --> 44:38.000
You were lucky.
