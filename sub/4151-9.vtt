01:11.818 --> 01:13.786
"She is here."
Shit, that can't be good.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.521
They still can't see me.

01:15.555 --> 01:17.690
It's hard to hear everything
they're saying, but...

01:17.724 --> 01:19.958
It's definitely a queen.

01:22.962 --> 01:25.864
"Assembly has begun."

01:25.899 --> 01:28.901
Well, Cochise was right.

01:28.935 --> 01:30.636
And if it is a queen,

01:30.670 --> 01:32.738
putting her in harm's way
seems like an all-in maneuver

01:32.772 --> 01:34.073
for the Espheni, doesn't it?

01:34.107 --> 01:35.808
Like a move to set up
a Checkmate.

01:35.842 --> 01:37.643
Ben, I'm calling it.
We're done. We're done.

01:37.677 --> 01:39.445
No, no, we're not even close.
One more time. - What?

01:39.479 --> 01:40.813
We still don't know
the exact location.

01:40.847 --> 01:42.014
We're gonna have that
one last --

01:42.048 --> 01:43.515
Are you listening
to yourself?

01:43.550 --> 01:45.050
She's right. No more.

01:45.085 --> 01:46.885
No -- Ben, no, no, no.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.054
It doesn't matter
how quickly you cool down, okay?

01:49.089 --> 01:50.789
It's destroying
your homeostasis,

01:50.824 --> 01:51.990
your organ function.

01:52.025 --> 01:53.459
No.

01:53.493 --> 01:55.461
There's no other choice.
Dad's right.

01:55.495 --> 01:56.962
At the very least,

01:56.996 --> 01:58.664
we have to figure out
where this queen is hiding.

01:58.698 --> 02:00.466
If what I'm hearing is true,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.034
the overlords are gonna
be dug in.

02:02.068 --> 02:03.435
Ben!
Hey!

02:03.470 --> 02:04.737
Aah!

02:04.771 --> 02:06.739
Aah! Stop!

02:06.773 --> 02:09.108
Come out of there!

02:12.245 --> 02:13.679
Stop!

02:13.713 --> 02:15.080
More people will die
if I don't!

02:15.115 --> 02:16.515
I have to do this!

02:28.995 --> 02:31.530
Hey. The 9th Carolina

02:31.564 --> 02:33.999
is crossing the Elizabeth River
at 0830.

02:34.033 --> 02:35.934
They're hauling ass.

02:35.969 --> 02:39.471
Impressive. We expect them
to merge with us here on I-95.

02:39.506 --> 02:43.075
Remind them. 2nd Mass
is moving out in 24 hours.

02:43.109 --> 02:45.010
So if Ben's right
and there is a queen,

02:45.044 --> 02:46.945
where exactly is
the tip of our spear

02:46.980 --> 02:48.680
gonna wind up on this map?

02:48.715 --> 02:50.682
He hasn't been able to exactly
pinpoint her location yet.

02:50.717 --> 02:52.518
How's he doing?
Getting his strength back.

02:52.552 --> 02:55.187
Working on his argument
to go back in.

02:55.221 --> 02:56.955
Got a stranglehold on him,
is what it's got.

02:56.990 --> 02:58.824
I say we blow the Espheni
hub-of-junk to kingdom come

02:58.858 --> 03:00.225
before it hurts anyone else.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.660
Well, we're keeping Ben
and everyone else

03:01.694 --> 03:02.861
away from it for now.

03:02.896 --> 03:04.763
Gentlemen, I have some
good news.

03:04.798 --> 03:06.498
Found an external transmitter
in the Humvee.

03:06.533 --> 03:08.100
Linked it
to our systems vector.

03:08.134 --> 03:10.035
It just boosted our signal.
So we can communicate

03:10.069 --> 03:11.970
with a larger number of militia
directly.

03:12.005 --> 03:13.539
Without having to use
the Volm as a middle man.

03:13.573 --> 03:15.040
That is a big step.

03:15.074 --> 03:16.842
The scramble beacon it found
should keep the Espheni

03:16.876 --> 03:18.577
from deciphering our frequency.

03:18.611 --> 03:20.245
42 militias.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.748
All seeking further instructions
from Tom Mason.

03:22.782 --> 03:24.340
Starting to have the feel
of a real invasion.

03:24.341 --> 03:25.192
Well, better be real.

03:25.193 --> 03:26.653
We don't know what the hell
we're walking into tomorrow.

03:26.686 --> 03:27.986
What should I tell them, Tom?

03:34.561 --> 03:36.895
Attention. This is Tom Mason.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.665
Tom Mason
of the 2nd Massachusetts.

03:39.699 --> 03:41.934
And we are now
in complete control

03:41.968 --> 03:45.504
of our communications network,
and there's more to come.

03:45.538 --> 03:47.806
Soon, we'll have more Intel
that will affect the plan,

03:47.841 --> 03:49.875
but for now, stay on
your present course of action.

03:49.909 --> 03:52.010
Take up positions 1 mile
outside of D.C.

03:52.045 --> 03:54.012
and await target information.

03:54.047 --> 03:59.117
What we're about to embark on
is massive, unpredictable.

03:59.152 --> 04:00.552
If you're anything like me,

04:00.587 --> 04:01.854
there's some fear
and trepidation,

04:01.888 --> 04:03.555
and that's okay.

04:03.590 --> 04:06.225
But don't let your feelings
turn to doubt.

04:06.259 --> 04:08.660
We are so close.

04:08.695 --> 04:12.798
Belief in what we're doing
will get us there.

04:15.668 --> 04:17.736
Damn.

04:20.906 --> 04:22.641
Matt, where you going
with that fuel barrel?

04:22.675 --> 04:24.643
Colonel Weaver wants them
all brought out for loading.

04:24.677 --> 04:27.179
Be careful with it.
All right.

04:27.213 --> 04:30.849
Don't just stand there, Dad!
The tide's going out! Hurry!

04:56.042 --> 04:58.677
Convince them
to let me back in.

04:58.711 --> 04:59.945
Please.

04:59.979 --> 05:04.049
Ben...I know
from personal experience,

05:04.083 --> 05:06.685
spikes don't make you
invincible

05:06.719 --> 05:08.253
or entirely stable.

05:08.288 --> 05:10.088
I learn something new
every time,

05:10.123 --> 05:12.591
things that can't be
ignored.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.093
The overlords were
making references

05:15.128 --> 05:17.129
to the Nazca lines,
remember?

05:17.163 --> 05:18.363
Peru, yeah.

05:18.398 --> 05:21.066
The myth that aliens
are responsible

05:21.100 --> 05:23.835
for the geoglyphs there --
it's not a myth at all.

05:23.870 --> 05:28.206
God...none of that is worth
killing yourself over, Ben.

05:28.241 --> 05:30.842
The Volm have been tracking
that area for months.

05:30.877 --> 05:32.778
They still don't understand
its relevance.

05:32.812 --> 05:35.113
It represents something
important to them, Maggie,

05:35.148 --> 05:38.116
and I know it's connected
to what's going on in D.C.

05:40.019 --> 05:43.922
You were willing to do anything
to take out your spikes, right?

05:45.858 --> 05:47.159
Yes.

05:47.193 --> 05:48.994
That's how I feel about this.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.907
Hello?!

06:01.941 --> 06:04.209
Hello?!

06:05.878 --> 06:08.647
All right!

06:08.681 --> 06:10.415
Why am I here?!

06:13.186 --> 06:15.220
Talk to me --

06:42.749 --> 06:44.816
That Beamer attached to it --

06:44.851 --> 06:48.320
that's the one that Lexi and I
flew to the Moon, right?

06:48.354 --> 06:51.857
The one where you found me,
the one where you took me.

06:51.891 --> 06:55.093
To be accurate,
we saved you.

06:55.128 --> 06:56.728
When acquiring other forms
of life,

06:56.763 --> 06:58.463
we determine their value
to the Dorniya

06:58.498 --> 06:59.998
and utilize them accordingly.

07:00.033 --> 07:01.867
Utilize them accordingly?

07:01.901 --> 07:03.468
A new Espheni presence
has made it

07:03.503 --> 07:05.737
increasingly difficult
to communicate.

07:05.772 --> 07:06.938
Yes.

07:06.973 --> 07:08.740
A queen.

07:08.775 --> 07:11.410
The queen.
She does not arrive

07:11.444 --> 07:14.212
until there is a confidence
that they have won.

07:14.247 --> 07:15.480
Confidence that they've won?

07:15.515 --> 07:17.983
We're winning.
This isn't over.

07:18.017 --> 07:22.020
You don't understand, Tom.
They destroyed us.

07:22.055 --> 07:25.891
I am all that remains
of our race.

07:25.925 --> 07:29.394
And I have vowed to take
thorough action to honor it.

07:42.508 --> 07:44.109
What is that?

07:44.143 --> 07:46.845
Now with the presence
of the queen,

07:46.879 --> 07:49.815
an opportunity has
presented itself.

07:49.849 --> 07:54.019
Using this capsule
will unleash a weapon.

07:55.488 --> 07:57.122
That's what you've been
working on.

07:57.156 --> 07:58.824
That's why you need me.

07:58.858 --> 08:02.027
I forged a mutual trust
with you,

08:02.061 --> 08:04.863
a soldier who has proven
himself capable

08:04.897 --> 08:06.465
of delivering it.

08:08.301 --> 08:11.303
If I take that to the queen,
what will happen?

08:11.337 --> 08:13.205
It will exterminate
all of them.

08:13.239 --> 08:17.042
Rid your entire planet
of Espheni...

08:17.076 --> 08:19.377
For all time.

08:19.412 --> 08:22.881
Take this offering...

08:22.915 --> 08:25.117
And find her.

08:25.151 --> 08:26.885
I will do my best
to lead you.

08:29.388 --> 08:31.289
Tom...

08:31.324 --> 08:34.092
This is the time to trust

08:34.126 --> 08:37.095
the very thing
that paralyzes you.

09:32.017 --> 09:34.986
Hey, Evelyn, what do you think
of your first patrol?

09:35.020 --> 09:36.487
It's pretty exciting, huh?

09:36.522 --> 09:38.923
Yeah. Beats washing
sweaty camp clothes.

09:38.957 --> 09:42.426
You, uh, look good,
with -- with a gun,

09:42.461 --> 09:44.695
you know, I mean,
in a weird way.

09:44.730 --> 09:47.098
I'm trained now.
It's not an accessory.

09:47.132 --> 09:49.000
You're relieved, Ev.
Thanks.

09:49.034 --> 09:51.035
Shift's over.
See you later.

09:51.069 --> 09:53.704
Have fun on patrol.
Yeah.

09:53.739 --> 09:57.074
I'm sure you're thrilled
with her replacement.

10:00.812 --> 10:03.481
I probably owe you
an apology.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.516
About what?

10:05.551 --> 10:07.818
About what happened
between your brothers --

10:07.853 --> 10:09.720
I'm sure you had to deal
with the fallout.

10:11.957 --> 10:13.524
I need you to know that

10:13.559 --> 10:16.160
it's the last thing
that I wanted in the world.

10:16.195 --> 10:17.929
We got enough problems.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.467
Was there anything
about amnesty

10:23.502 --> 10:24.969
in the new world order?

10:25.003 --> 10:28.105
Think you could pencil it in
on that list of yours?

10:28.140 --> 10:31.809
Sure.
I'll try to make a spot.

10:31.843 --> 10:35.880
Affirmative. Map reference J146.

10:35.914 --> 10:40.551
I repeat, Juliet-1-4-6.

10:40.586 --> 10:42.053
Can anybody hear me out there?

10:42.087 --> 10:43.454
Please respond.

10:43.488 --> 10:45.056
Roger that.
This is 2nd Massachusetts.

10:45.090 --> 10:46.524
Please identify yourself.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.092
Oh, my God. A voice.
Hello? Hello?

10:48.126 --> 10:49.627
Hey, get a location.

10:49.661 --> 10:50.895
Where are you?
Do you know?

10:50.929 --> 10:52.697
I'm in an abandoned house
in Georgetown,

10:52.731 --> 10:53.898
near the Whitehurst freeway.

10:53.932 --> 10:55.499
We were headed
to the rendezvous.

10:55.534 --> 10:56.867
Militia walked
right into them.

10:56.902 --> 10:58.202
Skitters. I got separated.

10:58.237 --> 11:00.037
She's stuck right
in the middle of it.

11:00.072 --> 11:02.073
Best best is to hunker down
and hope they pass through.

11:02.107 --> 11:05.076
Is anything near you?
Something to barricade yourself?

11:05.110 --> 11:06.911
I'm in a kitchen
with my only radio.

11:06.945 --> 11:08.512
They're breaking in!

11:08.547 --> 11:10.815
Is there a refrigerator near you?
Yes.

11:10.849 --> 11:12.617
Get inside.
Pull everything out.

11:12.651 --> 11:14.752
Shut yourself inside.
Right now. Do it.

11:14.786 --> 11:16.120
There's no time!

11:16.154 --> 11:20.224
Hello? Miss, talk to me.

11:20.259 --> 11:21.792
If you can't talk,
key your radio.

11:21.827 --> 11:24.829
Hello? Miss?

11:29.234 --> 11:30.768
It's bad out there.

11:33.639 --> 11:36.707
Do you think we'll surprise
the Espheni in D.C.?

11:36.742 --> 11:39.677
I guess we'll find out
tomorrow.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.819
Matt, careful!

11:48.854 --> 11:50.688
Easy.

11:50.722 --> 11:52.990
Slow down.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.768
Lexi.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.072
Matt?

12:08.106 --> 12:11.142
Oh, my God.
Matt.

12:12.611 --> 12:13.844
Step away from her.

12:13.879 --> 12:15.880
She's messed up bad,
Maggie.

12:15.914 --> 12:17.882
No, we are not gonna fall
for this again.

12:19.685 --> 12:20.885
Step away, Matt.

12:22.688 --> 12:25.323
I know.

12:25.357 --> 12:28.859
I know what you're feeling.
Please.

12:28.894 --> 12:30.861
Please don't.

12:33.265 --> 12:36.233
What if she's returned?
Like my father?

12:36.268 --> 12:38.736
Forget it.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.172
She's not who you want her
to be.

12:45.110 --> 12:48.579
No. This isn't up
to you.

12:48.613 --> 12:50.314
You don't get
to decide this.

12:50.349 --> 12:52.817
I'm walking her
to the gate.

12:56.655 --> 12:58.222
Come on...

13:01.393 --> 13:03.060
Okay.

13:04.363 --> 13:06.964
Open the gate!

13:19.044 --> 13:20.378
Lexi?

13:20.412 --> 13:23.080
Mom, it's you.

13:23.115 --> 13:27.251
Somehow I knew --
I knew where to find you.

13:27.285 --> 13:28.819
Everybody, stand back!

13:30.589 --> 13:34.859
Matt...She's an Espheni plant
just like Captain Marshall.

13:34.893 --> 13:37.328
No...
Colonel Weaver, no.

13:37.362 --> 13:40.197
Dan, let's wait
for Tom to get back.

13:40.232 --> 13:42.299
Let's discuss this
together.

13:44.936 --> 13:47.338
Secure her.

13:47.372 --> 13:49.807
4-man escort.

13:49.841 --> 13:51.075
Matt.

13:51.109 --> 13:52.877
Put a hood over her head.

13:52.911 --> 13:54.378
I don't want her
looking at this camp.

13:54.413 --> 13:56.947
Mom...Mom, please.

14:07.087 --> 14:08.254
With Katie,
there were lapses,

14:08.288 --> 14:10.189
but they weren't easy
to spot.

14:10.223 --> 14:12.663
The Espheni change just enough
to make them mission-effective,

14:13.041 --> 14:15.776
and somehow leave intact
what made them special to us.

14:20.449 --> 14:22.416
Is this what the war
looks like now?

14:22.452 --> 14:25.988
I think I liked it
better the other way.

14:26.022 --> 14:29.591
I know. It's hard to see her
in any form.

14:29.626 --> 14:32.527
Just knowing
what she really is now.

14:34.163 --> 14:35.931
I...

14:35.965 --> 14:38.100
No, I'm gonna be okay.
I'm okay.

14:38.134 --> 14:42.404
Just...What if it's
just for Intel?

14:42.438 --> 14:44.539
She could be
a safer alternative.

14:44.574 --> 14:46.174
Don't count on it.

14:46.209 --> 14:50.178
Katie was real to me --
living, breathing --

14:50.213 --> 14:52.881
until the rug got pulled.

14:52.915 --> 14:56.985
We can't let anything compromise
our mission in D.C. tomorrow.

14:57.020 --> 15:01.156
Don't introduce even
a possibility of Lexi

15:01.190 --> 15:04.860
to your mind,
to your heart.

15:06.763 --> 15:08.897
I don't know how
to do that.

15:08.931 --> 15:11.933
Yeah, you do. You can.

15:38.528 --> 15:40.862
I never thought

15:40.897 --> 15:44.166
when we said our goodbyes,
that this would be possible.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.769
What are the Espheni doing
in Washington, D.C.?

15:47.804 --> 15:49.571
What's there for them?

15:49.605 --> 15:52.040
I...I don't know.

15:52.075 --> 15:54.476
When -- when I was with them,

15:54.510 --> 15:56.778
there was no talk
of anything like that.

15:59.549 --> 16:02.951
I need some treatment
right now, mom.

16:02.985 --> 16:06.154
Don't call me that.

16:06.189 --> 16:08.056
You're Espheni.

16:08.091 --> 16:11.126
Don't think for a second
I care about your medical needs.

16:12.929 --> 16:15.964
Lexi died
at that power core.

16:15.998 --> 16:17.799
She's not coming back.

16:17.834 --> 16:22.604
That should be true, Mom,
but it isn't.

16:22.638 --> 16:24.106
Look.

16:24.140 --> 16:27.008
Please.

16:27.043 --> 16:29.478
Hold my hand.

16:34.117 --> 16:36.084
I've said my goodbye.

16:48.998 --> 16:50.632
Open the gate!

16:53.903 --> 16:56.138
That better be
the last fever dream excursion

16:56.172 --> 16:58.707
you take, my friend.
We need to talk right away.

17:00.143 --> 17:03.245
What's wrong?

17:03.279 --> 17:04.780
What happened?

17:09.685 --> 17:13.255
You've got people
asking a lot of questions.

17:13.289 --> 17:15.190
I'd be asking them, too.

17:18.661 --> 17:22.696
Like why are you here?
How did you find us?

17:22.732 --> 17:25.233
I was waiting
for the big bang.

17:25.268 --> 17:27.736
That final moment.

17:27.770 --> 17:29.905
And it never came.

17:29.939 --> 17:34.142
Big bang? You mean
the power core. The moon.

17:37.513 --> 17:40.148
Instead, there was mom,

17:40.183 --> 17:42.651
standing beside me.

17:42.685 --> 17:46.955
We were watching the explosion
from outside the ship.

17:48.791 --> 17:50.559
She told me everything
was gonna be okay.

17:50.593 --> 17:52.527
You didn't answer
my question.

17:52.562 --> 17:54.129
How did you get here?

17:56.299 --> 17:59.734
Something pulled me
from that ship.

17:59.769 --> 18:02.771
Then there was water.

18:02.805 --> 18:05.774
Waves and waves of water.

18:05.808 --> 18:08.710
Drowning?
Yes.

18:08.744 --> 18:11.112
But it wasn't a dream
or a vision.

18:11.147 --> 18:15.050
I was living it,
like I hadn't died.

18:16.552 --> 18:18.787
Then I hit the rocks.

18:20.122 --> 18:23.825
It doesn't help me,
does it?

18:23.860 --> 18:25.861
To get you to believe...

18:25.895 --> 18:28.263
Your willingness
to help us will decide that.

18:34.070 --> 18:37.706
If you are who
you say you are, tell me.

18:37.740 --> 18:39.975
In your time
with the Espheni,

18:40.009 --> 18:43.912
did they ever mention...
A higher being?

18:43.946 --> 18:48.617
Something that...
Controlled all of them.

18:48.651 --> 18:52.187
The physical abilities I had
when I was with them then --

18:52.221 --> 18:55.724
they're gone now, dad.
I'm sorry.

18:55.758 --> 18:57.826
I don't care about your powers.
I'm asking about your memory.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.160
What do you remember?

19:01.664 --> 19:04.900
They would refer
to something higher,

19:04.934 --> 19:07.636
like humans would -- a God.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.344
From what we gather,

19:16.379 --> 19:20.615
a queen has arrived
here in the states.

19:20.650 --> 19:23.985
A queen? You know this?

19:24.020 --> 19:26.121
Yes.

19:27.623 --> 19:30.926
That's not good, Dad.
That's not good at all.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.361
The queen is a real thing,

19:33.395 --> 19:36.230
not -- not an object of faith.

19:36.265 --> 19:39.000
That presence --
the arrival of this queen

19:39.034 --> 19:41.536
means only one thing
to the Espheni.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.371
Their objective has changed.

19:45.307 --> 19:47.008
Changed how?

19:47.042 --> 19:50.578
From invasion to occupation.

19:55.284 --> 19:57.719
Look, she knew.
She knew everything.

19:57.753 --> 19:59.287
She knew how it felt --

19:59.321 --> 20:01.022
things that made me
think I was crazy.

20:01.056 --> 20:03.257
To hear her describe it
made it real.

20:03.292 --> 20:05.393
Why are we even
entertaining this?

20:05.427 --> 20:07.695
It's obviously a ploy
to cut our legs out.

20:07.730 --> 20:10.598
I agree. We just don't know
what she's capable of.

20:10.632 --> 20:11.341
What did Ben say?

20:11.365 --> 20:13.701
He doesn't know. But he
had no idea with Katie either.

20:14.169 --> 20:15.503
Somehow the Espheni
have found a way

20:15.537 --> 20:17.505
of getting around
that kind of detection.

20:17.539 --> 20:19.540
Even her blood tests  came back normal.
What if she was sent to us,

20:19.575 --> 20:21.542
but not by the Espheni
but by the Dorniya?

20:21.577 --> 20:24.278
No. No way.
Why would they save her

20:24.313 --> 20:26.247
and then just wait so long
to bring her back to us?

20:26.281 --> 20:28.249
Why wouldn't they just tell you
that right there on the beach?

20:28.283 --> 20:30.118
The Dorniya said that when they
acquire a new life form,

20:30.152 --> 20:31.486
they determine its value

20:31.520 --> 20:33.421
and then they use it
accordingly.

20:33.455 --> 20:35.456
It said that -- "I will do
my best to lead you."

20:35.491 --> 20:38.393
So maybe Lexi's here
to help me deliver this.

20:38.427 --> 20:40.027
Deliver what?

20:40.062 --> 20:43.398
What is that?
It's a weapon.

20:43.432 --> 20:46.067
To deliver the Espheni queen
and wipe them out.

20:46.101 --> 20:48.302
Wipe them out?

20:48.337 --> 20:50.204
What are we talking here?

20:50.239 --> 20:52.073
Is this goes right to her,
every one of them everywhere,

20:52.107 --> 20:54.075
so you can see why I'm not
gonna assume anything

20:54.109 --> 20:55.610
if there's even
the slightest chance

20:55.644 --> 20:57.812
if Lexi could be used as some
kind of important tool.

20:57.846 --> 20:59.680
No, that's not what
you're saying.

20:59.715 --> 21:02.316
What you're saying
is that she was saved.

21:02.351 --> 21:05.219
I just -- I just -- I can't
go down that road again.

21:05.254 --> 21:07.622
I won't survive it.

21:10.125 --> 21:11.626
There are a lot of ways
that this can trip us up.

21:11.660 --> 21:13.194
I get that, believe me,

21:13.228 --> 21:15.563
but I'm not gonna
just look the other way.

21:21.274 --> 21:22.607
It's reckless, Tom,
all of it.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.022
You're bending the rules
to suit you.

21:25.122 --> 21:27.123
I mean, this is more
than just a leap of faith.

21:27.158 --> 21:28.792
Fine. I'll do it.

21:28.826 --> 21:30.727
Come on. I'll --
no, no, no.

21:30.761 --> 21:32.128
I'll take the lead.

21:54.151 --> 21:56.820
Ugh! I'm sick of this shit!
You okay?

21:56.854 --> 21:59.189
Yeah.
It didn't penetrate the glove.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.259
Well, I'm guessing that's the
stuff they want me to deliver.

22:03.294 --> 22:05.261
We need to test it.

22:05.296 --> 22:07.230
How? On what?

22:07.264 --> 22:09.366
I don't know, but we cannot
take that with us

22:09.400 --> 22:11.334
until we know more
about it.

22:17.008 --> 22:19.075
How do we know
it'll work on the Espheni?

22:19.110 --> 22:21.277
We don't. Not yet.
Toying with alien elements

22:21.312 --> 22:23.480
that don't even exist
on our periodic table.

22:23.514 --> 22:25.415
How's she gonna find
a needle in a haystack

22:25.449 --> 22:27.350
when she doesn't even know
what the needle looks like?

22:27.385 --> 22:29.152
That's --
Did you guys find something?

22:29.186 --> 22:31.821
We're keeping it
under wraps right now, Marty.

22:31.856 --> 22:33.423
You mentioned
the periodic table.

22:33.457 --> 22:35.125
I...I thought maybe
I could help

22:35.159 --> 22:37.060
with whatever it is.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.109
Your work experience
is in a brewery, right?

22:39.132 --> 22:40.029
It is, yes.

22:40.031 --> 22:42.032
I'm not quite sure
how that helps, Marty.

22:42.066 --> 22:45.769
I was the contracted
taste engineer.

22:46.971 --> 22:49.439
Biochemist.

22:52.076 --> 22:53.510
Follow me.

23:00.317 --> 23:01.484
Dad...

23:01.519 --> 23:03.119
My dad...

23:03.154 --> 23:05.955
wanted you to have
these medical supplies.

23:05.990 --> 23:08.291
Not mom?

23:08.325 --> 23:10.226
She's the doctor.

23:21.539 --> 23:23.773
Weird thing is,

23:23.808 --> 23:25.108
the muscles, my skin --

23:25.142 --> 23:28.178
I have all the built-in
human limitations.

23:28.212 --> 23:30.313
The way it's supposed to be.
It...

23:30.347 --> 23:32.849
It feels good.

23:38.322 --> 23:40.423
Does it still
weigh on you?

23:40.458 --> 23:43.426
The spikes?

23:43.461 --> 23:45.762
I mean, I know what
I look like right now,

23:45.796 --> 23:48.431
but you --
I've seen better days.

23:48.466 --> 23:50.500
I think I had actually
forgotten

23:50.534 --> 23:52.902
what a few of those
human limitations felt like.

23:52.937 --> 23:55.271
We've all had to become
so distrustful

23:55.306 --> 23:57.440
in order to protect ourselves --
I don't know who you are,

23:57.475 --> 23:59.209
really.

23:59.243 --> 24:01.511
Part of me...

24:01.545 --> 24:03.513
It's like I need
to apologize to you

24:03.547 --> 24:05.515
for not being the one
to go on that mission

24:05.549 --> 24:07.417
to the power core.
No, Ben, don't --

24:07.451 --> 24:09.586
Just a part of me.
The rest...

24:09.620 --> 24:11.321
Fears
you haven't come back

24:11.355 --> 24:17.360
and that what I see is just
another threat to all of us.

24:17.394 --> 24:20.630
And I am so tired of that.

24:25.336 --> 24:28.271
Just go, Ben.

24:50.594 --> 24:53.163
Have you seen Lexi yet?

24:56.133 --> 24:58.201
You know,

24:58.235 --> 25:00.103
after everything
that happened to Weaver,

25:00.137 --> 25:02.038
and all I've been through,

25:02.072 --> 25:03.840
I'm not quite ready
to invite her

25:03.874 --> 25:05.074
to the family picnic.

25:05.109 --> 25:07.210
Right or wrong,

25:07.244 --> 25:10.580
she's got powers
that terrify everybody.

25:10.614 --> 25:12.115
Nobody knows what it means
that she's here right now,

25:12.149 --> 25:13.883
and if for some reason
I'm wrong,

25:13.918 --> 25:16.386
I'll be the first one in line
to apologize to her.

25:16.420 --> 25:19.022
So...You're saying

25:19.056 --> 25:20.924
that you might have handled it
differently,

25:20.958 --> 25:23.626
you know,
bringing her back to the base?

25:23.661 --> 25:26.329
I would've, yeah.

25:26.363 --> 25:31.067
So if you had stumbled
upon dad out in the woods,

25:31.101 --> 25:33.436
after we all thought
that he died,

25:33.470 --> 25:36.105
if he needed you, would you
have just left him behind?

25:36.140 --> 25:38.308
This has nothing
to do with dad.

25:38.342 --> 25:41.344
Dad has never betrayed us.
Lexi is half Espheni, Matt.

25:41.378 --> 25:43.313
Yeah, I know all that,
okay?

25:43.347 --> 25:46.115
But turning my back
on her in that moment

25:46.150 --> 25:47.951
just didn't seem right.

25:59.330 --> 26:01.130
Is it safe?
Can we take it with us?

26:01.165 --> 26:03.132
That stuff jumped
out of that capsule,

26:03.167 --> 26:06.069
hit that rat in a second,
and it was dead instantly.

26:06.103 --> 26:08.137
And this is
test subject number two.

26:08.172 --> 26:10.340
The mucus it excretes
is nasty stuff,

26:10.374 --> 26:11.975
and it replenishes
on its own.

26:12.009 --> 26:13.443
I think
your Dorniya friends

26:13.477 --> 26:15.345
underestimated the danger
of their secret weapon.

26:15.379 --> 26:16.679
If it does take
out the Espheni,

26:16.714 --> 26:19.249
it can take out
all of us out with them.

26:19.283 --> 26:23.353
They never...
They never told me.

26:23.387 --> 26:25.555
They have me delivering this,
knowing what it can do?

26:25.589 --> 26:27.123
Why would they do that?

26:27.157 --> 26:28.892
Because they have
their own agenda, Tom.

26:28.926 --> 26:30.660
They're using you because
of your value to them.

26:30.694 --> 26:32.395
I mean, you said it
yourself.

26:32.429 --> 26:34.631
This has always been
about avenging their genocide.

26:34.665 --> 26:36.366
They don't care
about us.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.102
Or, quite simply,
they do not realize.

26:39.136 --> 26:41.170
How could they possibly
know any part of this formula

26:41.205 --> 26:43.139
could be harmful
to a human being?

26:43.173 --> 26:44.974
You're giving the Dorniya
the benefit of the doubt, too?

26:45.009 --> 26:47.277
How do we limit the damage
to just the Espheni?

26:47.311 --> 26:48.711
Can we even do that?

26:48.746 --> 26:50.647
We test
for viral pathogens

26:50.681 --> 26:53.416
and pray it's something
we're familiar with.

26:53.450 --> 26:55.685
Acts of prayer aside, yes,

26:55.719 --> 26:57.320
successfully altering
this material

26:57.354 --> 26:59.188
depends on whether it has
any proteins

26:59.223 --> 27:00.623
similar to your own.
Right.

27:00.658 --> 27:02.425
We're leaving for D.C.
in the morning.

27:02.459 --> 27:05.395
If this is a magic bullet,
and this could save lives...

27:05.429 --> 27:07.697
We have to try it.

27:12.303 --> 27:14.637
Anything that can be used,
we're gonna take with us.

27:14.672 --> 27:18.341
Think outside the box.
Good, Butterfield.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.643
All our militias
are en route.

27:20.678 --> 27:23.079
We leave in the morning,
or we're the last to arrive.

27:23.113 --> 27:25.014
What we need is
a backstage pass to the queen,

27:25.049 --> 27:26.649
and I think Lexi
might be it.

27:26.684 --> 27:29.152
You know that
this if this mission fails,

27:29.186 --> 27:31.387
the curtain falls,
maybe for good.

27:31.422 --> 27:32.722
I'll tell you what
I think you should do.

27:32.756 --> 27:34.457
You should test that
Dorniya venom

27:34.491 --> 27:36.225
on that Espheni in the brig
pretending to be Lexi,

27:36.260 --> 27:37.727
and we set sail.
I hear what you're saying.

27:37.761 --> 27:39.662
I'm not ready
to make that call.

27:39.697 --> 27:42.966
We've brought in what's left of
a militia from South Carolina.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.335
They lost a dozen men to
skitters 15 miles south of here.

27:45.369 --> 27:48.137
They're in dire need
of medical attention.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.275
Any advanced transmissions
from this unit?

27:52.309 --> 27:54.043
Nothing.
They're without a radio.

27:54.078 --> 27:57.146
Welcome to the 2nd Mass,
soldiers.

27:57.181 --> 27:59.315
We have protocol
that dictates

27:59.350 --> 28:02.018
all newcomers disarm
before being debriefed

28:02.052 --> 28:03.486
by base command.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.254
Look out!

28:07.658 --> 28:09.625
Take cover!

28:18.502 --> 28:19.702
Go!

28:23.040 --> 28:24.240
Ah!

28:39.567 --> 28:41.357
Nice place you got here,
Mason!

28:41.392 --> 28:43.092
I like what you've done with it!

28:43.127 --> 28:45.094
Bad penny.
Impeccable timing.

28:45.129 --> 28:47.163
Guess you're not the only
crazy son of a bitch

28:47.197 --> 28:49.065
with nine lives!

28:50.768 --> 28:53.469
Aah! Whoo!

28:54.671 --> 28:56.506
Kinda poetic, don't you think?!

28:56.540 --> 28:59.575
Storming the castle
to overthrow King Mason!

28:59.610 --> 29:02.111
For the last time, Pope, walk away!

29:02.146 --> 29:04.113
There's too many innocent people
between us

29:04.148 --> 29:05.314
to resolve our issues!

29:05.349 --> 29:08.084
Innocent people?!
Sorry, brother.

29:08.118 --> 29:09.619
They're all gone.

29:18.595 --> 29:19.796
Hold on!

29:29.473 --> 29:31.140
Aah!
Anthony!

29:38.082 --> 29:39.549
Come on! Let's get up!

29:39.583 --> 29:42.718
No, Anthony. Hurry up!
Hurry!

29:42.753 --> 29:44.787
So that's it, huh, pope?

29:44.822 --> 29:46.589
Everybody's the enemy?!

29:46.623 --> 29:48.691
Just Pope against mankind!

29:48.725 --> 29:50.760
No, Tom!

29:50.794 --> 29:52.328
Just you!

29:52.362 --> 29:54.530
And whatever else
gets in my way!

29:55.766 --> 29:57.867
See those barrels?
Yeah, man.

30:03.107 --> 30:06.809
Aah!

30:33.997 --> 30:35.905
So long, Pope.

30:50.797 --> 30:53.232
Emmett's still
patching people up.

30:53.266 --> 30:54.767
And that guy Anthony --

30:54.801 --> 30:57.637
looks like
he's gonna be okay.

30:57.671 --> 31:00.573
Hal was telling me
Anthony and Pope --

31:00.607 --> 31:03.175
at one time, they were important
to the 2nd Mass?

31:03.210 --> 31:06.112
Yeah, at one time,
they were.

31:08.281 --> 31:11.517
So what's our plan
in the morning with Lexi?

31:11.551 --> 31:14.120
I don't know.
There was a time

31:14.154 --> 31:16.255
where I thought I was
a pretty good judge of people.

31:16.289 --> 31:20.159
The good ones, the bad ones,
the Popes, the Anthonys.

31:20.193 --> 31:22.695
I think this war has
taken that ability from me.

31:22.729 --> 31:25.031
No, no, no, no.
Just listen to your gut.

31:25.065 --> 31:26.699
Your gut always knows.

31:26.733 --> 31:28.334
My gut's been trained
to be suspicious.

31:28.368 --> 31:29.635
What do you think?

31:29.670 --> 31:31.203
Who do you think's
in the brig?

31:31.238 --> 31:34.740
I'd love to think
it's my sister, you know?

31:34.775 --> 31:38.277
That she's the one who's gonna
lead us to the queen.

31:38.311 --> 31:41.047
It would be fitting, wouldn't it?
Yeah.

31:41.081 --> 31:46.018
Especially if she experienced
that same, uh, Dorniya rebirth

31:46.053 --> 31:50.089
that you did, but...
I don't think she's in there.

31:54.828 --> 31:57.229
But you know where to find me
if you need me.

31:57.264 --> 31:59.131
Love ya.

32:00.634 --> 32:02.768
You guys have a good one.

32:04.404 --> 32:07.440
♪

32:39.172 --> 32:41.507
"At the foot of the giant."

32:41.541 --> 32:43.442
What the hell does that mean?

32:45.178 --> 32:47.279
The foot of the giant.

32:47.314 --> 32:50.316
57 minutes. All is well.

32:50.350 --> 32:52.818
So when the other rat's
immune system

32:52.853 --> 32:54.487
became aware
of the Dorniya virus,

32:54.521 --> 32:56.188
it mounted
an inflammatory response

32:56.223 --> 32:58.057
that resulted in death?
Correct.

32:58.091 --> 32:59.325
But with
the alteration I made,

32:59.359 --> 33:00.760
enzymes from
the human red cells

33:00.794 --> 33:03.195
will bind to it
and block that action.

33:03.230 --> 33:04.563
Knock on wood.

33:06.099 --> 33:07.539
If we're right, Martin,
this is huge.

33:07.567 --> 33:10.136
Yeah. It's working
the same way

33:10.170 --> 33:14.273
fermentation enzymes work
on yeast back at the brewery.

33:14.307 --> 33:17.643
Did you ever think your beer
would save the world?

33:17.677 --> 33:19.645
It was good.

33:21.681 --> 33:23.215
None of you would even be
in this position

33:23.250 --> 33:24.550
if it wasn't for me.

33:24.584 --> 33:26.752
I destroyed
the Espheni power core -- me!

33:26.787 --> 33:28.821
And this is my welcome back?

33:35.295 --> 33:37.263
Can you guys
give us a minute?

33:41.868 --> 33:43.836
We're at a crossroad.

33:43.870 --> 33:46.839
I understand the Espheni.

33:46.873 --> 33:48.808
Isn't that
a valuable enough asset?

33:48.842 --> 33:50.442
Yes.

33:50.477 --> 33:53.078
And you could still be
critical to our objective.

33:53.113 --> 33:55.648
I've been given
some time back, Dad,

33:55.682 --> 33:57.716
a chance to fight for more,

33:57.751 --> 34:00.519
experience the life you gave me
the way I was meant to.

34:00.554 --> 34:03.255
We've both been given
a second chance.

34:03.290 --> 34:05.724
It's important that
we make it count.

34:39.659 --> 34:42.360
Oh!

34:46.699 --> 34:48.701
So this little guy
has been struck twice,

34:48.735 --> 34:50.536
and still nothing.

34:50.570 --> 34:52.438
You think the same
applies for us?

34:52.472 --> 34:53.772
Maybe.

34:53.806 --> 34:55.674
When this thing snatched
our new formula

34:55.708 --> 34:57.543
back into its capsule,

34:57.577 --> 34:59.411
it suddenly became
non-lethal.

34:59.446 --> 35:01.780
How do we know this does not
disrupt the ingredient

35:01.815 --> 35:03.482
lethal to the Espheni?

35:03.516 --> 35:06.318
We don't, not yet.

35:06.353 --> 35:07.887
Dad!

35:07.921 --> 35:10.256
Ben?

35:10.290 --> 35:13.492
What's wrong?
In the shadow plane...

35:13.526 --> 35:17.329
Dad...
It's about Dad.

35:21.668 --> 35:24.270
You can't face the queen.

35:24.304 --> 35:26.138
There has to be
another way.

35:26.172 --> 35:27.840
Why would you say that?

35:27.874 --> 35:29.575
Didn't you just tell me
that you didn't know

35:29.609 --> 35:31.777
anything about her?
Didn't you just say that?

35:31.811 --> 35:34.713
All Espheni
learn her objective

35:34.748 --> 35:36.148
about coming back.

35:36.182 --> 35:38.317
Coming back, what,
to life?

35:40.387 --> 35:41.820
To earth?

35:45.292 --> 35:46.759
She's been here before?

35:48.361 --> 35:50.429
A long time ago.

35:52.198 --> 35:54.566
The Nazca lines.

35:54.601 --> 35:57.369
It has to do with
the Nazca lines, doesn't it?

35:57.404 --> 35:59.471
Ben said that he overheard
the overlords saying

35:59.506 --> 36:01.307
that they represented
something important.

36:01.341 --> 36:03.709
Why would you
keep that from me?

36:03.743 --> 36:06.845
Please, Dad. My head,
my whole body hurts.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.814
I need mom.

36:14.487 --> 36:15.988
Uhh!

36:23.730 --> 36:26.131
Let him go!

36:26.166 --> 36:27.800
Just throw it!
Dad!

36:27.834 --> 36:30.369
Open that door!

36:40.680 --> 36:42.414
My God, it works.

36:42.449 --> 36:44.917
How many of you
are there?!

36:44.951 --> 36:46.585
Answer me!

36:46.619 --> 36:48.887
How many more
in Washington?!

36:53.626 --> 36:55.694
We're on to you.

37:17.851 --> 37:20.652
It's the overlords. I...
I heard them.

37:20.687 --> 37:22.454
The Espheni were
coming for you.

37:22.489 --> 37:25.691
We're not the only ones looking
for the head of the snake.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.928
Sorry, Tom.

37:59.831 --> 38:02.333
How are you holding up?

38:02.366 --> 38:04.901
I don't think I've ever
felt more terrified

38:04.935 --> 38:06.503
in my entire life.

38:06.537 --> 38:09.539
That's all of us.

38:11.976 --> 38:13.777
You know, I regarded her
as the enemy

38:13.811 --> 38:16.379
just like you and everybody else.
Yeah.

38:16.414 --> 38:18.848
Just thought that
if I could

38:18.883 --> 38:20.517
keep my emotions in check

38:20.551 --> 38:22.385
and I could get her
to confide in me,

38:22.420 --> 38:24.354
that she could be a valuable resource.
Yeah, yeah.

38:24.388 --> 38:26.089
I just...

38:26.123 --> 38:28.758
started thinking that maybe
she could be more than that.

38:28.793 --> 38:30.727
The Espheni are getting
better and better at it,

38:30.761 --> 38:34.531
because all they got left
is smoke and mirrors.

38:37.835 --> 38:40.770
You know, if we're not
successful,

38:40.805 --> 38:42.305
people like you and me are
never gonna be able

38:42.339 --> 38:43.873
to trust each other ever
again.

38:43.908 --> 38:45.375
That's why I don't plan
on losing.

38:51.315 --> 38:53.416
At the foot
of the giant.

38:53.451 --> 38:56.953
Ben said he heard
several of them repeating this,

38:56.987 --> 38:59.022
over and over again,
like a marching order.

38:59.056 --> 39:01.091
To some kind
of meeting place.

39:01.125 --> 39:04.127
At the foot of the giant.

39:07.865 --> 39:09.432
The Lincoln Memorial.

39:09.467 --> 39:12.302
The queen is located
at the foot of the giant.

39:12.336 --> 39:15.071
Abraham Lincoln's statue.
Well, I'll be.

39:15.106 --> 39:16.840
You were very reckless.
I'm very proud of you.

39:19.443 --> 39:21.511
That is
where we need to be.

39:45.970 --> 39:48.304
You always been
good to me, Colonel.

39:48.339 --> 39:50.874
I'm sorry.

39:50.908 --> 39:54.978
I was wrong
for following Pope.

39:55.012 --> 39:57.514
I lost my way with him,

39:57.548 --> 40:01.317
and I didn't see it
until it was too late.

40:01.352 --> 40:04.587
Look, if you left me behind,

40:04.622 --> 40:06.990
I wouldn't blame you.

40:08.359 --> 40:11.060
I don't deserve to be
traveling with y'all.

40:13.898 --> 40:16.633
You won't last alone
out here with a clipped wing.

40:18.435 --> 40:20.870
No weapons.

40:20.905 --> 40:23.173
I'm gonna have somebody
on you full-time,

40:23.207 --> 40:26.176
and when I feel
the time is right,

40:26.210 --> 40:29.913
you'll assist the Maryland
on our western flank.

40:47.298 --> 40:48.932
How did you know?

40:48.966 --> 40:50.934
Well...There was no way
for sure

40:50.968 --> 40:53.169
we could know if the virus
was gonna work.

40:53.204 --> 40:54.938
No, I mean about Lexi.

40:58.175 --> 41:00.643
I didn't know.

41:00.678 --> 41:02.579
I wanted to be wrong...

41:02.613 --> 41:04.614
...More than anything.

41:06.951 --> 41:09.018
What was that?
That's the Espheni hub.

41:09.053 --> 41:11.988
If there's even a chance
that it's a homing beacon,

41:12.022 --> 41:13.690
Colonel Weaver doesn't
wanna bring it with us.

41:13.724 --> 41:15.325
Well, we don't want them
to use it again.

41:15.359 --> 41:17.627
That's for sure.

41:17.661 --> 41:20.630
Hey, uh, Dad, I'm sorry
about bringing her back.

41:20.664 --> 41:23.299
Hey, we got a big piece
of the Espheni puzzle.

41:23.334 --> 41:25.535
We wouldn't have
if you hadn't.

41:30.107 --> 41:33.943
Attention all militias,
this is Tom Mason.

41:33.978 --> 41:37.013
Our persistence has paid off
once again.

41:37.047 --> 41:39.315
Guesswork is over.
We now have a specific target.

41:39.350 --> 41:41.150
I repeat, we now have it.

41:50.494 --> 41:53.229
They're headed right for us.
