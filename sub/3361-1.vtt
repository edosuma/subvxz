00:54.840 --> 00:56.637
The earth was sick ...

00:57.640 --> 00:59.153
 and SkyArk was built.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.958
The city in the clouds.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.474
The monster came out of nowhere.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.316
People fled to SkyArk.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.037
But SkyArk was too small for all.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.470
So they banished the poor and the orphans.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.796
It was an uprising.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.710
But SkyArk was more powerful.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.748
The children of the rebels
were captured ...

01:25.600 --> 01:28.558
 and they were given a
Brand for every sin of their parents.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.358
They were exiled to Earth.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.672
They built the camp of
Fallen and fought the monster.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.834
I'm Rusty.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.275
As their leader must
I give you hope.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.789
The son of the leader of the rebels,
should be given the ultimate punishment:

01:45.080 --> 01:47.071
A 13-fold time.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.950
So I invented a legend:

01:50.360 --> 01:53.158
A boy with 13 times
would come and save us ...

01:53.320 --> 01:54.548
 someday

02:41.000 --> 02:42.194
If you stay here, you die!

02:43.320 --> 02:44.753
Come on! Immediately!

02:46.160 --> 02:48.116
Let's go. Run!
Hurry Up!

02:52.880 --> 02:54.154
Stay close to it! Los!

03:03.280 --> 03:05.635
Run! Run!
- Where to?

03:08.960 --> 03:10.712
The monsters are coming!

03:15.360 --> 03:16.349
The camp of the Fallen.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.914
Monsters are on the hunt!
On your item. Los.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.835
Come on!

03:24.200 --> 03:25.394
From the fort.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.355
All in!
Quick! Now!

03:34.320 --> 03:36.038
I was here first!
- Does not matter!

03:36.160 --> 03:38.276
You're just a two, a four-I.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.631
Hey coward, how many do you have?

03:52.680 --> 03:54.671
Rusty, look! 13!

04:00.200 --> 04:02.350
So it's you.
- Who am I?

04:03.040 --> 04:04.598
So he's the 13?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.798
The 13 has come!

04:07.200 --> 04:10.715
Starting today, the monsters are afraid of us!

04:14.360 --> 04:15.952
Monster!

04:22.680 --> 04:23.999
It's your turn ...

04:24.800 --> 04:26.028
I do not know ... - Do not worry!

04:26.400 --> 04:27.799
I'm with you!

04:33.960 --> 04:35.473
I do not know how you are ...

04:35.840 --> 04:38.035
 I do not feel particularly safe.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.031
Where is it?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.188
He should be our Savior?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.873
Monster Snack?

04:45.840 --> 04:47.193
I show him how to do it.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.309
Well done.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.589
Beginner's luck!

04:59.600 --> 05:01.511
I bring that to an end.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.194
Ash! No!

05:24.480 --> 05:25.879
Get out of here!

05:33.920 --> 05:35.273
What was that?

05:36.160 --> 05:39.516
On SkyArk you warned us.
Are you naughty ...

05:39.840 --> 05:42.434
 send them down like the monsters.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.389
Monster?

05:44.800 --> 05:47.360
Horror stories for young children!

05:47.560 --> 05:48.754
You wish!

05:49.320 --> 05:51.197
The monsters live here below.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.112
In Hive.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.835
We hunt there during a new moon,
if they are weak.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.949
Why?

06:02.040 --> 06:03.314
The Blue drops!

06:03.760 --> 06:05.159
He heals every wound.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.715
The monsters hide him from us.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.593
Once we have the Blue drops ...

06:12.120 --> 06:15.157
 all our suffering is over now!

06:16.440 --> 06:17.953
You can stop this.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.158
Have you ever seen him? - No.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.834
Now that you are there, this will change!

06:24.200 --> 06:26.316
Why me? - Because ...

06:27.640 --> 06:29.232
 I am only one. 8

06:35.760 --> 06:36.988
Take a break!

06:59.520 --> 07:00.509
Ash ...

07:01.000 --> 07:02.752
 Thou shalt not go over the limit!

07:08.200 --> 07:10.316
Okay ... You're always what you want.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.673
Dad?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.154
What's going on here?

08:44.760 --> 08:46.955
Tell me the names ...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.991
 or we will send your son into exile!

08:53.080 --> 08:54.718
My son is into exile.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.475
DAD!

09:00.200 --> 09:01.918
NO! DAD!

09:03.080 --> 09:04.877
Dad ... Dad!

09:32.280 --> 09:34.794
Energy waste ... pretty!

10:12.560 --> 10:14.915
Um ... hello?

10:15.480 --> 10:17.675
Good morning, 13!

10:18.560 --> 10:20.152
My name is Rags.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.869
Here! Breakfast.
Ribs ... I think.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.955
Hey, Rags! Will you help me?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.872
Yes, please!

10:33.520 --> 10:35.272
Wow! Stop!

10:35.640 --> 10:37.949
Do you go out with my sister?

10:38.640 --> 10:39.789
She asked me!

10:40.280 --> 10:42.032
You're back before it gets dark!

10:42.280 --> 10:44.589
That's enough! Hau starting!

10:45.000 --> 10:46.228
Come here, birdie!

10:55.680 --> 10:57.557
Do you like my skirt? - Yes!

10:59.560 --> 11:01.152
Have I made from a parachute.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.591
I sew for all.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.638
Follow me ...

11:12.640 --> 11:14.198
Come on up!

11:20.200 --> 11:21.519
Where I help again?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.149
Will see you already.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.835
Caution Otherwise you hurt yourself!

11:36.560 --> 11:38.073
Good!

11:38.640 --> 11:41.677
Is easier than a bow ...
easy swing.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.155
Like a sword?

11:44.640 --> 11:45.834
That's just junk.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.352
Maybe just for you.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.118
You never smile?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.118
Earlier times ...

11:59.400 --> 12:01.914
You're really tough.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.999
How I see it ...

12:06.760 --> 12:09.672
 we are always eaten tomorrow.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.993
So?

12:12.720 --> 12:14.836
Do we still fun!

12:18.480 --> 12:20.710
En Garde!

12:32.160 --> 12:33.639
So you want to play?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.672
Just back to you.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.157
Everything okay?

12:53.760 --> 12:55.193
So do you care yet!

12:56.840 --> 12:59.115
Hold your chin up, Rags.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.717
Let's go home!

13:07.720 --> 13:09.995
Come on! She has a date with the 13 ...

13:10.240 --> 13:14.074
 in him we are sure!
- I do not want to go.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.114
It would be dangerous,
not to overhear!

13:30.640 --> 13:32.073
Do you miss it?

13:34.160 --> 13:35.639
Your home?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.758
What is that?

13:47.520 --> 13:50.751
So saw the earth from
SkyArk seen from ...

13:52.360 --> 13:55.397
 and the Blue ...
that is the ocean.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.513
My father had promised,
to go there with me.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.318
A beautiful promise.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.037
He can no longer comply.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.308
It's not far from here ...

14:19.520 --> 14:22.592
 maybe we go
times along the ocean. - Yes ...

14:22.920 --> 14:23.989
Yes!

14:24.360 --> 14:26.749
I go ahead and you kill all the monsters.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.754
Deal?

14:32.320 --> 14:33.833
It's a deal!

14:38.080 --> 14:39.593
What was that?

14:48.840 --> 14:50.956
Stop it!

14:58.080 --> 14:59.559
This is not funny anymore!

15:01.720 --> 15:02.948
Come on!

15:10.880 --> 15:12.199
13l

15:13.640 --> 15:16.029
Cool sword ... - Yes!

15:16.960 --> 15:19.713
The handle must be serious,
for the balance.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.839
Thus, it will be easier.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.673
Yes!

15:28.640 --> 15:30.392
I still remember
my first day.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.030
I can not stay. - What?

15:33.560 --> 15:35.790
I go to the ocean.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.109
Look ...

15:42.440 --> 15:45.557
 so we hunt monsters.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.233
And no boys.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.676
How So? But are a cute couple ...

15:51.000 --> 15:53.912
Sometimes, when it's quiet ...
I can hear it.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.279
I can hear the waves on the coast.
- He is so close?

15:57.640 --> 16:00.359
Just because something is close,
it is still not easy.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.077
Do Not Worry. You come out already.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.318
Lily ... it's broken again.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.234
I believe the 13 does not like me.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.712
He's just shy.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.357
Shall I tell you a secret?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.838
He told me,
that you're really brave.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.029
Yes?

16:22.320 --> 16:24.709
You are soon ready for
the hunt for the drop.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.711
He's a gutsy guy!

16:27.280 --> 16:28.679
Please!

16:29.520 --> 16:30.669
HEY "

16:31.120 --> 16:34.829
 Did you Birdie and
seen my sister?

16:41.960 --> 16:44.155
MONSTER!

16:47.360 --> 16:49.590
Camp of the Fallen ...
on the walls!

16:55.960 --> 16:58.918
Do not be crazy!
Let me go! That's Ember.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.473
Ember! Hurry Up!

17:16.560 --> 17:18.436
That's fine ...
- Is she all right?

17:21.160 --> 17:22.798
Where's Birdie?

17:29.520 --> 17:32.432
I thought that 13 could save us ...

17:39.840 --> 17:42.559
No more stories!
And no lies.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.073
She dies.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.555
We have to save them.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.999
What can I do?

18:03.320 --> 18:05.880
There are healing! - Where?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.990
In Hive, Rags.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.438
The Blue drops?

18:33.360 --> 18:34.588
Rags!

18:59.240 --> 19:01.390
It has always brought me luck.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.750
Take care of yourself!

19:38.480 --> 19:39.629
Lily ...

19:40.080 --> 19:41.911
 for Ash ...
- I'll bring them back.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.312
How do you know,
that does that stuff?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.192
I do not know.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.517
Maybe just a myth.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.030
Invented so that the
Can people hope.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.513
A terrible hope.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.230
I also think, however, we
all need to believe in something.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.590
You and Ash, you were ever ...

20:55.480 --> 20:57.038
 together?

20:57.440 --> 21:00.034
We are still together.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.472
We were the first here.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.357
I promised to protect them.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.033
And you know what?

21:10.800 --> 21:13.678
I think she protected me.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.676
Apparently my father was a traitor.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.039
That's right!

22:19.400 --> 22:22.278
One of the best!
He saved my dad.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.831
Has risked his life for the uprising.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.233
They would have brought almost SkyArk basis.

22:29.960 --> 22:34.192
Yes, almost! - We come
be fine with a building.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.797
And ... only a few monsters? - Exactly!

22:39.720 --> 22:41.392
Only a few monsters.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.429
Come!

24:56.000 --> 24:56.989
Back!

24:57.720 --> 24:58.835
Rusty!

25:17.840 --> 25:19.478
She looked like a human being.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.958
I thought she sees
me in the dark.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.109
Perhaps needs glasses!

25:26.600 --> 25:28.272
All right?
- There is nothing.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.312
This heals the Blue drops.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.354
Let's go.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.876
Who built this?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.873
Monster!

26:14.520 --> 26:17.193
Okay ... but no people.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.514
Go to the stairs! I draw him
from and you attack from behind.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.713
To kill a monster,
you have to be a monster.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.916
Be a Monster!

26:36.680 --> 26:38.432
Come on!

26:53.960 --> 26:57.794
Now! Do it!

27:09.920 --> 27:10.989
Rusty!

28:18.080 --> 28:19.229
Farewell, Ember ...

28:27.160 --> 28:28.957
 here is Mister Monster.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.835
He will save us, right?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.835
So be it, right?

28:41.880 --> 28:44.553
You're just a stupid doll!

28:51.160 --> 28:52.639
I'm sorry.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.392
I did not mean.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.875
That's my camp!
- I'm sorry.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.033
Go away! - I
but can not go anywhere!

33:22.720 --> 33:25.188
My name is ...
- No names!

33:26.520 --> 33:29.193
Why not?
- Because I say so!

33:34.040 --> 33:35.314
It's cold down here.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.031
Come on!
- Get out!

33:47.800 --> 33:49.836
Hurry Up.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.399
What was that? - You
are his lunch.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.229
Monster?

34:02.720 --> 34:04.233
The there really?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.358
Did you just ...?

34:08.840 --> 34:11.070
I call you skunk!

34:14.280 --> 34:15.793
I have a mission.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.188
Nice for you!

34:17.600 --> 34:19.955
Will you help me? It's a secret mission.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.156
What are you? A secret agent?

34:22.480 --> 34:23.629
Yes!

34:23.880 --> 34:26.474
Agent Skunk ... Wow!

34:27.080 --> 34:29.310
Shall I my
Betrayed mission? - No!

34:29.600 --> 34:32.989
Seeking the boy with the 13 times.

34:34.639 --> 34:35.868
How So?

34:36.480 --> 34:40.359
The rebels are waiting
that he comes back.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.190
They gave me that.

34:44.719 --> 34:47.598
What? - Look more closely.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.034
What is that? - A Camera.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.358
Pretty turned what?

34:56.800 --> 34:58.472
How should these boys look like then?

34:59.240 --> 35:00.559
Guess he's tall.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.512
Bigger than me?
- Definitely.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.991
And more ...
no offense.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.798
How many times do you have?

35:16.760 --> 35:17.988
Three.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.918
And they still bleed.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.473
Thank you! - Do you take constantly?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.873
Yes! While peeing
I close my eyes.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.999
The Ocean ...

35:56.560 --> 35:57.879
HEY "

35:58.320 --> 36:00.515
 to the fall?

36:08.960 --> 36:12.509
Rags? What are you doing?

36:14.160 --> 36:15.388
Rags ?!

36:16.720 --> 36:19.712
You can add me yet
not leave here ...

36:20.080 --> 36:21.479
Please!

36:22.560 --> 36:23.879
Rags!

36:24.320 --> 36:25.673
Let me back here.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.678
Lily ...

36:28.520 --> 36:31.557
Rags! - My Goodness ...

36:41.760 --> 36:45.036
Was there a monster?
Do you have fought it? - Yes ...

36:45.800 --> 36:47.597
Bring it to me!

36:58.920 --> 37:00.751
I am not a good fighter ...

37:01.400 --> 37:03.356
Everyone has a monster in itself.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.073
That you have to let out!

37:05.520 --> 37:06.589
And if it is eating me?

37:06.800 --> 37:09.519
It's Your Monster!
Ready to control it.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.718
Imagine that I am a monster ...

37:12.280 --> 37:13.918
 was not a coward!

37:14.760 --> 37:16.512
Try it from behind.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.157
You have a try.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.879
Do go!

37:29.160 --> 37:30.513
I knew you
it does not have it.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.993
Lily?

37:46.880 --> 37:49.189
Nice to see you! - Pfft!

38:02.480 --> 38:03.913
Lily!

38:05.960 --> 38:08.758
People! Wait for me.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.155
The monsters have come Rags.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.152
They killed the children?

38:37.600 --> 38:39.079
I am so sorry.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.478
I'm not who you think.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.872
I'm not a hero.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.675
You believe in the 13 ...

38:50.200 --> 38:52.077
 But what should I believe?

38:52.640 --> 38:54.358
I do not have anything!

39:03.960 --> 39:06.394
Wait! - You are a traitor.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.315
Where are you going? - I will bring to an end,
what he could not.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.070
Ehm, cool? May I see your times?

39:14.760 --> 39:15.795
Go away!

39:26.520 --> 39:27.635
Wow!

39:28.200 --> 39:29.553
How mean.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.119
She is right!
- They have in common.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.119
Thank you!

39:53.280 --> 39:55.874
Why us
brought this creepy place?

39:56.480 --> 39:58.596
The boy with the 13 times ...

39:59.560 --> 40:01.152
He was here?

40:03.080 --> 40:04.593
 he is dead.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.033
You know what I think?

40:44.320 --> 40:46.231
No ... what?

40:47.040 --> 40:49.508
Can you read minds?

40:49.920 --> 40:52.195
Can you lift a plane?

40:57.120 --> 40:58.394
No Chance!

40:58.720 --> 41:00.392
She looked pretty weak ...

41:01.880 --> 41:04.235
Ah! I know: you can not cook!

41:04.920 --> 41:06.194
No! -Yeah!

41:06.600 --> 41:09.273
She makes lunch!
- What are you talking about?

41:09.520 --> 41:12.592
She said: Stop,
what you could not ...

41:13.080 --> 41:14.593
What I could not?

41:14.920 --> 41:18.117
Finally there is what
to eat! - Oh no ...

41:19.640 --> 41:21.232
 the Blue drops!

41:22.800 --> 41:24.199
Where are we going?

41:24.760 --> 41:27.672
For Hive! - Cool! Essen.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.275
We get no food, right?

41:56.600 --> 41:57.874
Go back to camp.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.832
I need to find Lily.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.034
It is not worth it.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.033
She is so mean!
Let's get off.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.352
Hide behind the light ...
everything will be fine.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.111
I know this from a book.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.232
Stop it!

43:00.400 --> 43:01.719
What you are doing?

43:01.880 --> 43:03.677
It's not working.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.314
Ash?

43:24.360 --> 43:26.874
What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

43:27.360 --> 43:30.796
What a Iahmes Monster ...
is afraid of himself.

43:37.640 --> 43:41.519
Thanks for the rescue! - Without me,
the monster had eaten you.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.388
That would have ruined my home.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.790
What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

43:56.160 --> 43:57.832
What's wrong with you?

44:53.800 --> 44:55.279
You live here?

44:57.400 --> 44:58.958
Cool!

45:05.400 --> 45:07.197
Did you see Lily?

45:08.160 --> 45:09.798
You are too late.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.029
Come, Skunk ...

45:12.320 --> 45:15.153
How So? I like it here!

45:16.120 --> 45:17.439
What is your name?

45:17.720 --> 45:20.314
That's Skunk.
- Agent Skunk!

45:21.320 --> 45:22.514
Oh really?

45:23.240 --> 45:25.629
Yes! Take a look at my eye on.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.916
Not so fast, sweetheart.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.749
Where did you get that? - Bring it on!
That belongs to me.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.479
That's Rusty Armor.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.718
What do you care?

45:38.280 --> 45:39.952
You let him die.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.633
Come on ... we are looking for Lily.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.590
We build the camp again.
- There is no longer camp.

45:56.680 --> 46:00.468
You are cut down, I ran away.
There is nothing more.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.472
Monsters are on the hunt.

46:16.560 --> 46:19.916
Come on! We hunt monsters.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.437
You too!

47:07.560 --> 47:10.120
I bring you past the dog ...
but that was it!

47:11.680 --> 47:14.319
Attention! The Chain!
Come on nothing!

47:14.680 --> 47:17.240
Here you can kill almost everything.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.393
Why did not the air?

47:29.880 --> 47:32.553
To the light around looks
If only the darkness.

47:33.560 --> 47:34.993
Yes ...

48:08.320 --> 48:10.390
We need a decoy.

48:11.400 --> 48:15.029
I vote to you!
If you sign up voluntarily?

48:15.880 --> 48:17.233
You girls!

48:40.480 --> 48:42.914
Argh, a staircase! - What?

48:49.200 --> 48:50.428
Ash!

48:50.800 --> 48:53.075
No! No!

49:36.040 --> 49:37.712
A toy stone?

49:38.040 --> 49:40.600
How childish ...
- Do not be sad.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.478
It's just a monster.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.036
Ash? Everything OK?

49:51.560 --> 49:54.120
Yes! From now on you
Your placed on you.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.552
Wait!

49:58.520 --> 50:00.715
How many times do you have?

50:03.640 --> 50:06.871
How many do you mean? - Many!

50:10.040 --> 50:12.349
This is what counts, Agent Skunk!

50:17.160 --> 50:18.434
Ash!

50:20.880 --> 50:22.438
Do not let go ...

50:23.520 --> 50:25.431
You can not hide forever.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.390
Come with us!
- I'm sorry.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.591
I do not kill more monsters.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.317
Why kill Ash no monsters?

50:46.280 --> 50:47.269
No Idea.

50:48.480 --> 50:49.879
I do not think she's scared.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.514
At least not from the monsters.

50:53.400 --> 50:56.915
Ash? Do You Think,
Ash would go out with me?

51:50.120 --> 51:51.599
God!

52:03.400 --> 52:04.833
Hey!

52:07.760 --> 52:09.716
Kit and Cat?

52:10.600 --> 52:12.079
They were twins.

52:13.480 --> 52:15.072
How sad.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.233
Where have they gone?

52:19.360 --> 52:21.920
Ouch! Oh God.

52:31.560 --> 52:32.913
No noise more!

52:45.600 --> 52:47.556
"SkyArk has the Monster
create - staying away "!

52:47.800 --> 52:50.109
What does that mean?

52:50.440 --> 52:51.668
This is a warning.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.559
SkyArk ...

53:03.240 --> 53:05.276
 they sent the monsters.

53:13.760 --> 53:15.955
SkyArk created the monster.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.039
What for?

53:20.160 --> 53:21.639
Look at the poster!

53:22.160 --> 53:24.469
This enabled them to people
imprison on SkyArk.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.516
How dark.

53:31.720 --> 53:34.393
You feed the monster with the kids.

53:37.160 --> 53:38.878
My father is no traitor!

53:39.600 --> 53:41.431
That is why they have been fighting.

53:43.240 --> 53:45.071
I am ...

53:47.160 --> 53:48.309
 Food?

53:49.840 --> 53:51.512
Do you take on that?

53:55.800 --> 53:57.756
You have eaten the children.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.878
All shredded.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.079
But no blood.

54:09.440 --> 54:10.634
No bone.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.673
They even ate the bones.

54:19.480 --> 54:21.118
Find a mirror!

54:21.880 --> 54:23.074
Okay ...

54:25.160 --> 54:27.151
Please! Help me! Get me off!

54:27.320 --> 54:28.912
I do not want to be eaten.

54:31.080 --> 54:32.559
Too small!
- I know!

54:38.440 --> 54:39.839
He is afraid of ugly monsters.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.109
I want to go back.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.913
I want to go back!

54:46.680 --> 54:48.511
I want to go home.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.876
Skunk! Remember your mission.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.512
How many times did the boy?

54:55.880 --> 54:56.869
What?

54:57.920 --> 55:01.435
1 ... 2 ... - 13! Or?

55:01.800 --> 55:03.552
Yes ... You are the hero?

55:03.800 --> 55:06.792
We are the heroes!
- I knew it.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.314
Agent Skunk,
are you food?

55:10.560 --> 55:12.869
No Sir! I'm no food!

55:13.240 --> 55:15.435
I'm a monster.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.633
Where are you going?

55:26.680 --> 55:28.159
And off you go!

55:35.240 --> 55:36.389
Birdies doll ...

56:34.760 --> 56:35.829
I understand ...

56:51.800 --> 56:53.791
I'm a monster!

57:15.520 --> 57:16.714
I can not believe it.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.188
I'm a monster!

57:18.600 --> 57:20.795
And I found you.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.877
I'm a hero.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.079
A great day!

57:26.960 --> 57:27.995
Halt not!

57:28.400 --> 57:30.356
I got to be a hero.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.198
I'm going back with you, Agent Skunk.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.835
You'll be a hero! I promise.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.512
But first I have to find Lily.

57:39.600 --> 57:42.114
We would have been on SkyArk friends?

57:43.600 --> 57:45.192
Of course, Agent Skunk.

57:45.800 --> 57:47.438
Yes Yes!

57:48.480 --> 57:50.357
As brothers! - Yes!

58:00.280 --> 58:02.555
The mask is you!
- Hurray!

58:05.920 --> 58:08.036
Take it from never!

59:06.720 --> 59:08.039
Sorry, Rags ...

59:08.360 --> 59:10.430
 They even ate the bones.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.315
No!

59:15.560 --> 59:17.312
This means that she was here!

59:18.760 --> 59:21.274
We find the Blue drops,
we also find Lily.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.549
I'll help you to find them.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.752
Oh no!

59:30.120 --> 59:31.394
Rags?

59:32.120 --> 59:33.633
Do not move!

59:35.040 --> 59:36.792
Will everything be all right?

59:38.680 --> 59:40.591
Tu but something!

59:40.840 --> 59:41.909
Okay ...

59:42.640 --> 59:44.437
 very slowly ...

59:47.720 --> 59:50.109
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.793
Everything will be fine.

59:53.720 --> 59:55.870
I have failed.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.391
Do not let go!

59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.309
I have not finished the mission.
I have never brought anything to the end.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.071
Everything will be fine.
Do you know why?

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.198
We are the heroes!

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.398
Together we are heroes!

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.149
As brothers ... - like brothers!

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.112
No!

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.510
Help! - Hold on!

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.948
Skunk!

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.432
His mask.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.034
I go ahead and you kill all the monsters.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.349
Deal?

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.834
It's a deal!

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.872
That's for Skunk!

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.393
The Blue drops!

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.040
That's him? -
The Blue drops!

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.033
We found him!

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.353
You found him.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.312
I have found only you.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.193
Rusty!

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.477
You're ...

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.675
SkyArk created the monster!

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.590
So you can the people
caught hold on SkyArk.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.917
As a prison.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.432
Kit and Cat ... they were twins.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.914
No blood ... no bones.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.031
She looked so human.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.998
It seemed as could
they do not see me.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.039
To kill a monster,
you have to be a monster.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.313
I'm a monster.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.951
All of these monsters ...

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.913
 were children.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.478
What have I done?

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.312
Rusty?

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.030
In order to survive in a world full of monsters ...

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.310
 You have to be a monster.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.399
You can stop this.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.150
The pain, the suffering.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.633
Drinking!

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.633
When I connect to you ...

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.396
 I'm as good as dead.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.832
I do not want to hurt you.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.595
Rusty ... Stop it!

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.757
He is no longer Rusty!

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.672
Run! - Come on!

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.678
You can not hurt me!

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.072
Why are you running away from me?

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.028
How So?

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.631
Because of you I have remained.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.074
Lily ...

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.193
To kill a monster,
must be a monster you!

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.038
Please, Rusty ...

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.592
 You are not a monster!
You can control it.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.475
Please! You are my brother.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.355
Ash! Bring Lily out of here.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.913
Hurry Up!

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.679
No!

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.440
Go! Before the
Control lose! - No ...

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.716
 I will not leave you! - Go!

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.872
Do not do that. NO!

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.237
Lily!

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.314
Come!

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.959
Hey ...

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.112
Watch out! - Rags!

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.717
Skunk ?! - Lily!

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.952
You live!

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.193
That you have forgotten.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.630
The real monsters are up there.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.476
We go upstairs to SkyArk.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.115
We finish what my father started.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.199
Skunk ...

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.872
 You can take the mask off now.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.599
Is my mission completed?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.513
Yes, Agent Skunk!

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.516
You found me.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.438
Found 13 ... rescue in progress ...

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
