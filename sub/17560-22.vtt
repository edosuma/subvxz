enough, but it's not.

because I'm jealous.

with that other girl

09:45.418 --> 09:48.254
Sometimes fellas with no
personality make up for it

09:48.337 --> 09:50.131
in the nether regions.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.676
- I'm hanging up.
- Kiss him.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.678
- I am not gonna kiss him.
- Kiss him.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.221
He is a nine out of ten.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.889
You've got to
at least try to kiss.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.392
Maybe bells will go off
and it will trigger something.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.394
Like a personality.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.023
- Lauren, I don't know--
- You're pushing 30.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.192
Oh, I guess one kiss
ain't gonna kill me.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.450
[instrumental music]

10:19.952 --> 10:21.996
Oh, my God, Tina, I just set up

10:22.079 --> 10:24.915
the most romantic table
for two on the terrace.

10:24.999 --> 10:28.336
[gasps]
Oh, and I also got
two beautiful steaks

10:28.419 --> 10:31.589
and I also bought
the most amazing cake.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.090
Guess what I had them
write on it?

10:33.174 --> 10:36.344
I love you, Vince.
Oh, oh, I know.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.971
Oh, my God, I am so excited,
but I'm so nervous

10:39.055 --> 10:41.807
and I also have the worst pain
in my stomach.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.227
Oh, I just left my tag on.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.813
[doorbell rings]
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
He's here, he's here.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.566
Oh, my God. I cannot believe
I've waited so long for this

10:50.649 --> 10:52.568
and I'm finally gonna tell him.

10:52.651 --> 10:55.029
Tina, thank you so much
for all of your help.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.615
Okay, call me
when you get this message.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.330
Coming.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.591
Surprise.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.145
[whispers]
So when does everybody else
gonna jump out

11:28.229 --> 11:30.272
and say surprise?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.983
They're not.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.654
Why?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.697
[laughs]

11:38.781 --> 11:40.991
Wait till you hear.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.995
Hey, uh, Niki.
Ricki. Whatever.

11:46.997 --> 11:50.167
Oh, my God.
It is the funniest story.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.336
[laughs]

11:54.213 --> 11:57.341
- What's the funny story?
- Okay, so get this.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.553
I totally forgot
and I meant to tell the people

12:00.636 --> 12:02.304
to come early who were
supposed to come late

12:02.388 --> 12:05.141
and I told you guys to come
early, late, you know.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.561
Oh, I get it.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.729
I come in thinking
the surprise party's been ruined

12:10.813 --> 12:13.232
get all bummed, then all
of a sudden, everybody pops out

12:13.315 --> 12:16.026
and yells surprise.
Ooh, it's a double-double.

12:16.110 --> 12:20.156
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Double-double.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.867
Oh, there's a terrace. I bet
they're all hiding out there.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.870
No, no, no, no. They're not
hiding on the terrace.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.414
Holly, you are a bad liar.
Come on.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.834
Uh, okay, well

12:31.917 --> 12:34.003
the romantic table
that's set for two

12:34.086 --> 12:36.213
is just one
of the many romantic tables

12:36.297 --> 12:38.340
that was yet to come.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.925
Uh..

12:43.804 --> 12:46.891
Tina. Tina. Tina.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.392
- Hey, what's up?
- Get dressed.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.728
Call Gary and Ben and get over
to my place immediately.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.730
You know, forget it.
No time to get dressed.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.732
- Just lose the mud.
- Why?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.066
Because you look
like an idiot.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.776
Okay, what,
what is going on here?

12:57.860 --> 13:01.071
Okay. It's Vince's surprise
party. He showed up with Ricki.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.740
- Oh, my God--
- I know. Shut up.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.825
No time for shock.
Just call everybody

13:04.909 --> 13:07.119
and just tell them I forgot
to send them an e-vite, okay?

13:07.203 --> 13:12.166
- Uh, I didn't get an e-vite.
- You did, Tina. You did.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.959
- What do you want--
- Okay, stop it.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.378
Just come over now and eat
something before you come.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.464
- Why?
- Because I have two steaks.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.882
And six people to feed.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.926
Okay? And yeah, I'm gonna
need these cucumbers.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.886
No, they-they have green mud
all over them.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.263
Or a lovely avocado dip.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.608
- Wow.
- Yep.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.818
- Nothing.
- No.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.865
Well, the bread was delicious.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.493
And we did discuss business,
so I can deduct dinner.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.454
Wow.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.382
I finished cleaning my table.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.553
- Oh, crap, you beat me again.
- Yes.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.514
Now let's see if you can
beat me at scrub the pans.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.601
- Oh, game over. Okay.
- Val.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.436
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dad.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.439
So, uh, you're back
awfully 7:30-ish.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.400
- Mm-hmm.
- How was the kiss?

14:19.483 --> 14:21.443
Horrendous.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.283
Uh, Paul?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.243
Would it be okay
if I break it to Ryan?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.245
Yeah. Thanks.
I'll go get the car.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.706
Um, if the kid says anything
about child labor

14:33.789 --> 14:36.250
he is a kidder.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.006
Listen, Ryan.
You're a really nice guy.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.466
Uh-oh. The nice guy speech.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.304
I really tried.
I wanted this to work.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.972
I mean, it was so perfect
on paper.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.140
It's okay.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.559
If it's not there,
it's not there.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.896
Oh, you're so sweet.
You're making this so hard.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.733
This is the hardest breakup
I've ever been through.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.359
And I've been through plenty.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.530
Do you think maybe
we could still be friends?

15:06.614 --> 15:08.032
We have enough friends.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.160
We're looking
for a relationship.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.203
That sounds like my line.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.583
Oh, come here. Hug.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.002
Oh. You know what?

15:20.085 --> 15:23.756
If I ever have a son someday,
I hope he's just like you.

15:23.839 --> 15:28.052
Well, you'll have a better shot
if you marry my dad.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.304
That ship has sailed,
little man.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.766
- Bye-bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.226
Well, we just got Paul's Bentley
out of the lot, Val.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.686
Did you know
he had a Bentley?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.980
That's the gazillion dollar
English car.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.024
I don't care about Bentleys.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.692
I don't care
if he's perfect on paper.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.695
If there's no chemistry,
then I'd rather be alone.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.615
Oh. Well, congratulations.
Your wish has come true.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.910
[instrumental music]

15:56.163 --> 15:59.458
Mmm, these cucumbers are good.
Who made the avocado dip?

15:59.541 --> 16:00.876
Noxzema.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.215
- Old strawberry?
- I'll pass.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.342
I wouldn't wanna eat something
that was meant for someone

16:08.425 --> 16:10.094
who was actually invited.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.390
What is your problem?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.850
All I know is if I was having
a surprise party

16:16.934 --> 16:18.435
for your best friend, you would
have been the first one

16:18.519 --> 16:21.480
I invite.
I'm hurt, Holly, I'm hurt.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.857
You know, you start to think
of yourself as part of a group

16:23.941 --> 16:26.610
and all of a sudden,
find out you're not.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.612
- I'm not made of stone.
- It's very cold.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.531
Oh, my God, I told you.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.617
I sent you both an e-vite.
Tina got hers.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.994
- Didn't you, Tina?
- Totally got it.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.579
Of course, she got invited
to Vince's party.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.207
She slept with him,
for God's sake.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.506
Everybody.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.508
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

16:49.591 --> 16:51.093
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

16:51.176 --> 16:53.262
♪ Will Tina meet me
on the patio? ♪

16:53.345 --> 16:55.764
♪ Everyone just talk
amongst yourselves ♪♪

16:59.059 --> 17:00.352
I cannot believe this.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.312
I was just about to tell him
that I love him

17:02.396 --> 17:04.021
and he is here
with another girl.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.567
My God, I hate him.
I feel sick.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.113
Ooh, did you eat the pickles
wrapped in bologna?

17:11.195 --> 17:12.948
Help me, Tina. We gotta get
everybody out of here.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.284
I cannot even look at him.
Oh, my God.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.785
- Gary's getting the cake.
- So?

17:16.868 --> 17:18.579
It's the I love you, Vince cake.

17:18.662 --> 17:19.829
[gasps]

17:19.913 --> 17:21.623
Gary, Gary, Gary,
Gary, Gary, Gary!

17:21.707 --> 17:23.834
What? What? Now I can't have
no birthday cake?

17:35.095 --> 17:36.764
What?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.267
Oh, we need plates.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.231
What? What?
I'm getting us plates.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.649
- Holly
- Oh, you know what?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.234
I'm gonna check
on those bug zappers

17:49.318 --> 17:50.652
because there's a lot
of bugs. Zzz.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.446
Oh, there's a big one.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.871
- Holly?
- Yeah? What's up, birthday boy?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.206
I saw what was written
on the cake.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.832
Oh. Happy birthday, Vince?
I know.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.709
It's not the most clever.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.796
- It said I love you, Vince.
- What?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.714
Holly, did you have plans
just for the two of us tonight?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.717
No, no, no, no.
Why would you say that?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.011
No one else got an invitation,
you planned a candlelight dinner

18:16.095 --> 18:18.680
for two, and you bought a cake
that said I love you, Vince.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.809
Well, somebody's got
quite the ego.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.895
Will you stop it?

18:24.978 --> 18:27.022
Just for once,
can't you just open up

18:27.105 --> 18:28.524
and be honest
with your feelings?

18:28.607 --> 18:32.444
Fine! Okay! You want honesty?
You want open-inity?

18:32.528 --> 18:35.364
Well, I think that it is
horrible that you would show up

18:35.447 --> 18:37.115
to my surprise party
with another girl.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.367
We're friends.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.785
Well, I don't think
she thinks you're friends--

18:39.868 --> 18:42.371
Not me and her.
Me and you.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.457
You told me a thousand times,
we're just friends.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.501
You told Ricki
we're just friends.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.336
You practically told me
to go out with her.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.047
And you read into that?
Oh, my God.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.966
How am I ever gonna be able
to trust you again?

18:54.049 --> 18:58.220
Are you ever gonna be able to
stop going out with other girls?

18:58.303 --> 19:00.055
Are you insane?

19:00.138 --> 19:02.057
For the past few months,
I have been living

19:02.140 --> 19:04.017
like a monk trying to get you
to trust me again--

19:04.101 --> 19:06.562
Okay, well, I'm sorry
that it's so hard for you.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.524
Stop turning this on me.
You know how I feel about you.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.235
I'm in love with you.
I want to be with you.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.153
I don't want anyone else.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.614
And-and you know what
I'm starting to think?

19:17.698 --> 19:20.492
The problem isn't me.
It's you.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.328
- Me?
- Yes, you.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.414
Holly, our problem
isn't about Ricki.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.041
It isn't about trust.
It isn't about other girls.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.419
It's about you finding reasons
to keep us apart.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.213
Oh, my God,
that is so ridiculous.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.090
Think about it, Holly.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.926
I'm not the one who's afraid
of a commitment.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.388
You are.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.899
- Are you okay?
- I'm really screwed up.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.736
You are? I just broke up
with an eight year old.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.614
Oh, yeah?

19:58.697 --> 20:00.532
Want some cake?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.370
Dare I ask where you keep
the ice cream?

20:07.664 --> 20:10.876
Honey, today I learned
chemistry is so important

20:10.959 --> 20:12.502
and if you've got it,
go for it.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.129
And you and Vince have it.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.924
I mean, I don't know,
but maybe Vince is right.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.009
- Maybe he's on to something.
- Oh, my God.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.094
I cannot believe
that you're taking his side.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.596
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah-huh.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.097
Otherwise you would have said,
"Holly, I think

20:24.181 --> 20:25.807
you're on to something."

20:25.891 --> 20:29.061
Maybe you just need to take a
look at who's pushing who away

20:29.144 --> 20:31.605
in this little non-relationship
thing you've got going.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.566
I mean, maybe Vince isn't
the one with the problem.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.777
Maybe it is you.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.363
Maybe it is me.

20:39.446 --> 20:43.033
What am I gonna do?
How am I gonna fix me?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.577
Well, for starters,
you should stop serving people

20:45.661 --> 20:47.412
cake off your ass.
