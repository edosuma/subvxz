parents and town
advocates alike,

00:47.599 --> 00:50.933
for joining us on

We're here tonight to kick off

00:53.849 --> 00:56.557
our most ambitious
school year yet.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.265
We've run the numbers,

01:00.349 --> 01:03.599
there's no simpler way

And now, I'd like to bring out
the man responsible.

02:08.598 --> 02:09.973
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

02:10.056 --> 02:11.599
In his ten years here,

02:11.683 --> 02:14.057
he's revamped
our education system.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.641
From pre-K all the way
to high school.

is there any way

03:57.224 --> 03:58.432
you'd be able to grab
my diet smoothie?

takes me seriously.
All right?

04:24.265 --> 04:27.265
That Militzok,
she plays favorites, okay?

04:27.349 --> 04:29.099
She wouldn't even let him
take a bathroom break

04:29.182 --> 04:32.057

and he has
a hyperactive bladder.

Chad, honey,
tell him how you...

04:33.849 --> 04:35.891
you know what, I have a note
here from his doctor, okay?

04:35.974 --> 04:37.766
Ms. Schweitzer,
just, just calm down.

04:37.849 --> 04:40.099
-Let's, let's just--
-No one will listen to me.

04:40.182 --> 04:41.891
All right, I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

04:41.974 --> 04:44.808
Chad, he is just as gifted
as everyone else in his year.

04:44.891 --> 04:46.474
-Absolutely.
-And...

04:46.557 --> 04:48.224
I'm scared, Dr. Tassone,

04:48.307 --> 04:50.641
because if he
doesn't get into OMNI...

04:52.015 --> 04:53.891
and he starts to think
of himself as less than...

04:53.974 --> 04:55.391
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:55.724 --> 04:57.099
No, I will talk
to Ms. Militzok.

04:57.182 --> 04:59.182
I will straighten
this whole thing out.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.474
-You will?
-Yes.

05:00.557 --> 05:02.849
And, and we'll just set
a make-up test for Chad.

05:02.933 --> 05:04.641
All right, with ample
bathroom time.

05:05.015 --> 05:06.140

when I was your age,

I didn't even place
into fast track math.

or something like that.

10:21.516 --> 10:22.516
Yeah, coal.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.474

early Christmas shopping

34:20.181 --> 34:21.724
over the weekend, too.

34:22.474 --> 34:24.306
See, I wasn't gonna mention
until after the holiday

34:24.391 --> 34:25.933
because I bought you something,

34:26.014 --> 34:27.683
and I didn't,
I didn't wanna spoil it.

34:27.766 --> 34:31.139
I swear, I swear,
I was gonna reimburse it all.

34:31.974 --> 34:32.974
How much?

34:33.056 --> 34:35.099
Not much, you know.
Just like, um...

34:35.599 --> 34:37.224
maybe...

34:37.306 --> 34:39.766
$1,600 at Lord & Taylor and...

34:40.099 --> 34:41.766
another 12 at Macy's.

34:50.516 --> 34:51.974
Frank's gonna fix this.

34:54.516 --> 34:56.056
Give me good news, Phil.

34:56.139 --> 34:58.140
There's no way.
There's, there's no way.

34:58.224 --> 34:59.557
There's check warrants
that are missing.

34:59.641 --> 35:02.182
Purchase orders.
I took her word for it.

35:02.265 --> 35:04.683
She would tell me one thing,
she'd say don't worry about it,

35:04.766 --> 35:08.057
and I believed her like the
fucking idiot schmuck I am.

35:08.474 --> 35:12.349
Oh, I never even think
to check up, to validate.

35:12.557 --> 35:15.015
I'm gonna lose my job.
I'm gonna lose our firm.

35:15.099 --> 35:16.641
-We're dead, they'll kill us.
-Hey, hey, no, no, no--

35:16.724 --> 35:19.307
Nobody's killing anybody.
Phil, look me in the eye.

35:19.391 --> 35:20.974
Look me in the eye.

35:24.057 --> 35:26.557
You're running the show here.
Say it after me.

35:26.641 --> 35:28.391
"I am running the show."

35:31.349 --> 35:33.140
-I am running the show.
-Good.

35:34.557 --> 35:35.432
Pull it together.

35:35.516 --> 35:37.307
How much did
you find concretely?

35:39.015 --> 35:40.307
Uh...

35:41.933 --> 35:43.599
Two hundred twenty-three.

35:44.057 --> 35:45.849
Concretely, but that's
just the obvious stuff.

35:45.933 --> 35:48.224
-Who knows what else is buried--
-$223,000.

35:51.391 --> 35:53.391
Okay, okay.

35:54.557 --> 35:55.891
(exhales)

35:56.307 --> 35:57.724
That's our number.

35:58.724 --> 35:59.974
-What are you talking about?
-That's the number

36:00.057 --> 36:01.599
we go back
to the board with, 223.

36:01.683 --> 36:03.057
No, you're not hearing me.

36:03.140 --> 36:04.474
That might just be
the tip of the iceberg.

36:04.557 --> 36:06.099
-Well, you don't know that.
-Frank.

36:06.391 --> 36:08.140
The receipts are gone.

36:08.224 --> 36:09.724
They're in the bin
of a shredder, probably.

36:09.808 --> 36:11.224
She could have misplaced them.

36:11.307 --> 36:12.599
I mean, there's a very
real scenario here

36:12.683 --> 36:14.849
where all the other expenses
are legit, right?

36:15.432 --> 36:17.474
-Maybe, I don't know.
-Okay, Phil, Phil.

36:17.557 --> 36:19.391
She's not some
criminal mastermind.

36:19.474 --> 36:20.724
All right, Pam is our friend,

36:20.808 --> 36:23.057
and she has made
a stupid mistake.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.307
But what...

36:27.391 --> 36:29.808
but what about
the state comptroller?

36:30.891 --> 36:32.349
Hevesi could barge
into this office

36:32.432 --> 36:34.557
at any given moment,
conduct an outside audit.

36:34.641 --> 36:37.641
Has he ever done that once
in your 30 years of experience?

36:39.724 --> 36:40.808
Exactly.

36:40.891 --> 36:42.391
Just...

36:43.099 --> 36:45.474
give me a number, and...

36:47.099 --> 36:48.557
I'll take care of the board.

36:50.391 --> 36:52.432
(tense percussive music playing)

36:52.516 --> 36:55.891
♪ ♪

37:14.307 --> 37:16.974
Frank:
Okay, okay, everyone.

37:17.057 --> 37:18.933
So, the, uh...

37:20.307 --> 37:22.265
the sum total is $250,000.

37:22.349 --> 37:23.599
-What?
-Jesus, are you kidding me?

37:23.683 --> 37:25.057
(all clamoring)

37:25.140 --> 37:26.974
-That woman
has a set of balls on her.
-We can just--

37:27.057 --> 37:28.724
-When I get my chance.
-Bob: You never will.

37:28.808 --> 37:30.724
She's gonna be Nassau PD's
for the taking.

37:30.808 --> 37:32.391
-And that shitbird son of hers.
-No, no, no, no, no.

37:32.474 --> 37:34.057
-No, no, no, Bob.
-Okay, all right,
let's do this right.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.140
-Put the phone away, Bob.
-And why should he?

37:36.224 --> 37:38.849
Because we will lose everything.

37:43.432 --> 37:44.557
What do you mean, Frank?

37:44.641 --> 37:46.182
Once word gets out about Pam,

37:46.265 --> 37:48.641
we're inviting
"The Times," "Newsday,"

37:48.724 --> 37:50.766
and every other paper
in the tri-state area

37:50.849 --> 37:52.265
-to our front door.
-With all due respect,

37:52.349 --> 37:54.683
screw the papers.
This is a very real crime here.

37:54.766 --> 37:56.140
A theft of taxpayer money.

37:56.224 --> 37:57.516
Judy, you've served
on the school board

37:57.599 --> 37:58.766
for how long, seven years?

37:58.849 --> 38:00.641
-Eight, proudly,
-Okay, and in eight years,

38:00.724 --> 38:02.599
how many times
has our budget been passed

38:02.683 --> 38:04.265
by taxpayers without incident?

38:04.349 --> 38:05.641
-Eight.
-Right.

38:05.724 --> 38:07.265
So what happens
when our next budget goes up

38:07.349 --> 38:08.599
for approval in May?

38:08.683 --> 38:10.391
The budget that
we've worked all year on.

38:10.474 --> 38:12.349
The stimulus that
gets us the SkyWalk.

38:12.432 --> 38:14.766
That gets us to first.
What happens?

38:15.015 --> 38:16.391
Wendy:
I get what he's saying.

38:16.474 --> 38:18.265
I mean, how's it going to look?

38:18.683 --> 38:20.808
A school employee
is able to take

38:20.891 --> 38:23.099
hundreds of thousands of dollars
from the coffer

38:23.182 --> 38:24.474
without anyone noticing.

38:24.557 --> 38:27.265
Why would we pump more money
into the school system?

38:27.349 --> 38:28.891
Right, if a scandal
this seismic breaks,

38:28.974 --> 38:31.432
I mean, our budget
is torpedoed, done.

38:31.516 --> 38:32.766
We are right back to square one.

38:32.849 --> 38:34.766
I don't know,
you can't pay the teachers.

38:34.849 --> 38:36.265
Maybe they start migrating out.

38:36.349 --> 38:38.557
Whoa, this can't affect
the colleges, huh?

38:38.641 --> 38:40.849
I think we'd have to expect
that admissions

38:40.933 --> 38:42.182
at top-tier schools
would view us

38:42.265 --> 38:43.808
under a radically
different lens, yeah.

38:43.891 --> 38:45.516
No, wait, what, what,
why would they ever?

38:45.599 --> 38:47.891
If they smell trouble,
then they...

38:48.557 --> 38:50.724
I don't know,
they might decide to lay off
Roslyn kids for a while.

38:50.808 --> 38:52.307
"Yeses" can become
"nos" overnight.

38:52.391 --> 38:54.432
I've-I've heard of that
happening before.

38:54.891 --> 38:56.683
I have.
So anyway, let's just...

38:57.307 --> 38:58.891
let's tease this out, okay?

38:59.891 --> 39:02.766
We don't perform,
we go down in the rankings.

39:02.849 --> 39:05.557
And then our sister schools
nose us out of
the top ten, top hundred.

39:05.641 --> 39:07.391
Syosset and Jericho,
those sons of bitches.

39:07.474 --> 39:08.641
Frank:
And that's when
we start seeing

39:08.724 --> 39:10.724
property values
adversely affected.

39:15.391 --> 39:16.557
(scoffs)

39:17.599 --> 39:19.265
He's right.
Of course he is.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.432
As far as real estate,

39:22.140 --> 39:24.140
especially Long Island,

39:24.516 --> 39:26.015
a town is only as good as its...

39:26.099 --> 39:27.641
Public school system.

39:29.891 --> 39:31.974
After everything
we've worked for, huh?

39:32.849 --> 39:35.933
Years that it's taken to,
to, to get this far.

39:39.599 --> 39:41.265
These are our kids
we're talking about.

39:43.766 --> 39:45.599
I can think of one other option.

39:48.099 --> 39:49.391
(door opens)

39:50.182 --> 39:51.432
Frank.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.015
(clears throat)
Everything's gonna be okay, Pam.

39:54.099 --> 39:57.474
We're, we're gonna get you
home to your family real soon.

39:58.224 --> 40:00.099
We're good, close the door.

40:01.516 --> 40:04.099
The board is very aware
of how hard you worked

40:04.182 --> 40:06.182
for the schools,
for Roslyn, for their kids.

40:06.265 --> 40:09.015
They know what an asset
you've been, and, um...

40:09.557 --> 40:12.182
that is why they see this
for-for what it is.

40:12.265 --> 40:13.391
A lapse in judgment.

40:13.474 --> 40:15.057
And in light of that,
they're opting

40:15.140 --> 40:17.307
not to press charges
or involve the police.

40:17.391 --> 40:19.224
Thank you, thank you.
All of you.

40:19.307 --> 40:21.933
So you'll make full
restitution to the school

40:22.015 --> 40:24.307
at the sum of $250,000.

40:24.974 --> 40:27.140
250, full--
full restitution, of course.

40:27.224 --> 40:28.391
I'll, I'll make it happen.

40:28.474 --> 40:29.641
And then you'll finish out
the work week

40:29.724 --> 40:31.307
and resign quietly.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.099
Wait.

40:36.182 --> 40:37.265
(chuckles)

40:37.349 --> 40:38.349
-What?
-Frank: Okay.

40:38.432 --> 40:39.599
Tomorrow morning,
you'll surrender

40:39.683 --> 40:41.599
your administrators license
to the board

40:41.683 --> 40:43.599
and you'll sign
an NDA committing--

40:43.683 --> 40:46.683
Frank, Frank, I don't--
I don't understand
what's happening.

40:46.766 --> 40:48.516
I don't understand this.
Why are you--

40:48.599 --> 40:51.307
You stole from the schools, Pam.

40:51.391 --> 40:53.599
From, from the taxpayers.

40:53.683 --> 40:56.015
From, from the kids
we're supposed to serve.

40:57.015 --> 40:58.391
I mean, this...

40:59.057 --> 41:01.391
kind of behavior goes beyond
the bounds of immoral.

41:01.474 --> 41:03.307
It, it's, it's cruel, it's--

41:03.808 --> 41:06.391
It's heinous.
It's, it's sociopathic, even.

41:06.641 --> 41:08.140
Sociopathic, what?

41:08.224 --> 41:09.557
The shameless self-interest.

41:09.641 --> 41:12.432
The, the, the
unstable personality.

41:12.516 --> 41:15.349
The parade
of rotten marriages, it--

41:15.724 --> 41:17.057
Frank.

41:18.974 --> 41:20.724
Look, you need help, Pam.

41:21.349 --> 41:22.891
Real medical help.

41:23.557 --> 41:24.808
You're a sick woman.

41:24.891 --> 41:26.891
We're concerned
about you, Pam.

41:36.933 --> 41:38.099
(scoffs)

41:38.933 --> 41:40.224
Um...

41:41.683 --> 41:43.182
I am...

41:43.557 --> 41:45.015
I'm a sick woman.

41:46.015 --> 41:47.391
I'm...

41:47.474 --> 41:50.557
I'm ashamed of my actions.
I'm ashamed of myself. I'm--

41:51.224 --> 41:53.349
There's no excuse for it.

41:54.182 --> 41:56.349
Well, the sociopathy.

41:57.766 --> 41:59.766
-Yeah, Bob, the...
-Yeah.

42:02.474 --> 42:03.557
Okay.

42:03.933 --> 42:06.265
We'll make all the arrangements
first thing tomorrow morning.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.599
Yeah, of course.

42:19.599 --> 42:21.224
Good night, all.

42:26.432 --> 42:28.432
Judy:
Well, that went better
than I thought.

42:29.683 --> 42:30.974
Bob:
You saved our ass, Frank.

42:31.057 --> 42:33.641
-Woman: Oh, God, yeah.
-Thank you.

42:33.724 --> 42:34.933
Woman: Yeah.

42:41.349 --> 42:42.849
(phone ringing)

43:05.974 --> 43:07.474
PAM (on phone):
 What the hell was that?

43:08.557 --> 43:10.432
I... can you hear me?

43:11.474 --> 43:12.474
Frank?

43:13.182 --> 43:14.516
(Pam stammers)

43:15.140 --> 43:16.224
Okay.

43:16.307 --> 43:18.808
I'm just, I'm just trying to...

43:18.891 --> 43:20.599
I'm trying to wrap
my head around this.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.683
(stammers)

43:48.724 --> 43:50.849
(phone ringing)

43:52.891 --> 43:54.140
Kyle (on phone):
 Hey.

43:54.224 --> 43:55.432
I wasn't sure
you were gonna call.

43:55.516 --> 43:56.683
(chuckles)

43:57.849 --> 43:59.349
Kyle:
 Is everything okay?

44:00.015 --> 44:01.849
Yeah, sorry, I, um...

44:03.349 --> 44:05.015
just wanted to hear your voice.

44:23.641 --> 44:25.057
-Pam: Where is he?
-Howard: Pam.

44:25.140 --> 44:26.808
-Where is he?
-Howard: Pam, just...

44:26.891 --> 44:28.391
-Just sit down for a second.
-Pam: No, I wanna talk to Jimmy.

44:28.474 --> 44:29.974
-Where is he?
-Just sit down for a little bit.

44:30.057 --> 44:31.391
Is he in this room?
No, he's in
his bedroom, isn't he?

44:31.474 --> 44:32.683
-Just--
-Don't touch me.

44:32.766 --> 44:34.099
-Don't touch me!
-All right!

44:37.432 --> 44:38.599
Hey, Ma.

44:43.099 --> 44:44.391
Hi, Ma?

44:44.474 --> 44:45.766
Hi, Ma?

44:46.599 --> 44:48.015
-Hey, Aunt Pam!
-Get outta my house, Jimmy!

44:48.099 --> 44:50.349
-Pam!
-I don't want you here anymore.

44:50.432 --> 44:51.808
-Get the hell out!
-Pam.

44:51.891 --> 44:53.432
-I don't wanna see
your face anymore.
-Pam, stop it.

44:53.516 --> 44:54.849
-Stop it, you don't mean it.
-Hey, what's going on?

44:54.933 --> 44:56.683
You don't mean it.
She doesn't mean it, Jim.

44:56.766 --> 44:58.974
-She doesn't mean
one word of it.
-Amber: What's going on?

45:00.766 --> 45:01.933
Howard:
Your mother lost her job today.

45:02.015 --> 45:04.683
Yeah, not my job, Howard.
My career.

45:05.432 --> 45:07.724
Amber:
I don't get it, can't you
just get a different job

45:07.808 --> 45:09.224
at another school?

45:14.808 --> 45:16.724
They're taking my license.

45:17.724 --> 45:19.265
Mom, what did you do?

45:19.557 --> 45:21.766
(sighs)

45:23.307 --> 45:24.933
I took money from them.

45:26.683 --> 45:28.974
Yeah, I stole.
We all did.

45:29.474 --> 45:31.391
Howard:
Okay, look, just go back
to your rooms, please.

45:31.474 --> 45:32.557
-Yeah.
-Please let me talk
to your mother.

45:32.641 --> 45:34.140
Your car, your clothes.

45:34.224 --> 45:35.724
This house,
the other houses.

45:35.808 --> 45:39.307
-What are you talking about?
-You didn't want state school.

45:39.683 --> 45:41.599
You wanted private college.

45:44.099 --> 45:46.224
I wanted you
to be happy with me.

45:46.307 --> 45:49.349
Pam, Pam, listen.
It's okay.

45:49.891 --> 45:52.307
We'll get you a job down
at the dealership, okay?

45:53.057 --> 45:55.933
Yeah, yeah, they're looking for
a new girl at the front desk.

45:56.140 --> 45:58.057
-Like a secretary?
-No, no.

45:58.140 --> 46:00.516
Not, not as--
not like a secretary.

46:00.599 --> 46:02.099
You'll find something.
I'm just saying--

46:02.182 --> 46:03.349
-I have degrees.
-I know.

46:03.432 --> 46:06.224
I went to school for years
to get degrees.

46:06.307 --> 46:08.557
I drove the bus.
I did the steno pool.

46:08.641 --> 46:11.182
-I did everything I had to.
-Listen to me, Pam.

46:11.265 --> 46:13.140
-Listen to me.
-I'm gonna be sick.

46:13.224 --> 46:15.766
You are the smartest woman
I have ever known.

46:15.849 --> 46:17.391
We're gonna get through this
and you're gonna

46:17.474 --> 46:19.307
land on your feet, you will.

46:21.140 --> 46:22.349
Come here.

46:23.724 --> 46:25.349
-Howard.
-I know.

46:26.057 --> 46:27.557
-Howard.
-I know.

46:28.224 --> 46:29.432
I know.

46:29.516 --> 46:31.307
(bell rings)

46:41.516 --> 46:43.015
Rachel:
Hi, Mrs. Gluckin.

46:43.474 --> 46:44.849
Uh, I was just wondering.

46:44.933 --> 46:46.933
Could I get the key
to the basement again?

46:47.015 --> 46:49.474
I just want to look up
a few more things.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.724
What's this for, Rachel?

46:51.808 --> 46:54.307
Rachel:
Just for some stuff
I wanted to verify.

46:54.683 --> 46:56.099
I can answer your questions.

46:58.224 --> 47:00.349
Uh, okay, well...

47:01.140 --> 47:03.641
I did the math,
and it looks like the SkyWalk

47:03.724 --> 47:06.307
is gonna end up costing
around eight million dollars.

47:06.391 --> 47:08.140
-Seven-five, sure.
-Right.

47:08.224 --> 47:10.432
It just seems like
a lot of our resources

47:10.516 --> 47:12.265
to be spending on cosmetics.

47:13.391 --> 47:16.599
Cosmetics?
People love the SkyWalk.

47:16.683 --> 47:18.182
"The Beacon" loves the SkyWalk.

47:18.265 --> 47:19.974
There was that nice poll
you guys did.

47:20.057 --> 47:21.349
Right.

47:21.432 --> 47:23.974
But the ceilings at the
high school are still leaking.

47:24.057 --> 47:26.057
I mean, some of the classrooms
had to get shut down.

47:26.140 --> 47:27.140
Sounds like you
should bring that up

47:27.224 --> 47:29.057
with your
student government.

47:31.557 --> 47:33.140
There was also
the pizza oven.

47:34.224 --> 47:36.182
-What?
-I saw a line item

47:36.265 --> 47:38.808
in the expense reports
for a pizza oven.

47:39.140 --> 47:40.766
But then I asked Paula
in the cafeteria

47:40.849 --> 47:42.349
and she said she knew
nothing about it.

47:42.432 --> 47:43.641
Just stop it.

47:48.307 --> 47:50.265
I am sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

47:50.349 --> 47:52.933
but no one is keeping
anything from you, okay?

47:53.015 --> 47:55.683
On the contrary,
we come in here every day

47:55.766 --> 47:58.140
at the crack of dawn
because we care.

47:58.599 --> 47:59.974
We care about providing you

48:00.057 --> 48:03.557
with a proper quality education
because we're good people.

48:03.933 --> 48:06.182
Because we want you
to have a good life.

48:06.265 --> 48:07.599
Okay?

48:09.641 --> 48:10.808
Okay.

48:11.265 --> 48:12.391
Pam: Okay.

48:14.641 --> 48:17.808
The individual purchase orders
are still public record, though.

48:21.933 --> 48:23.182
(chuckles)

48:24.474 --> 48:26.099
(opens drawer)

48:26.182 --> 48:27.516
Pam: Here you go.

48:29.641 --> 48:31.265
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

48:31.974 --> 48:33.057
Oh, and Rachel.

48:33.140 --> 48:35.224
You were right about
that pizza oven.

48:35.557 --> 48:37.140
It didn't go
to the high school

48:37.474 --> 48:39.432
because we bought it
for the middle school.

48:39.974 --> 48:42.391
Yeah, they have pizza
for days down there.

48:42.474 --> 48:43.808
Go get yourself a slice.

48:50.307 --> 48:51.224
Frank: Morning.

48:51.307 --> 48:52.933
-Hi.
-Oh, hey, Rachel.

48:54.140 --> 48:57.182
Dr. Tassone, Pam Gluckin's
in a bit of a state.

48:57.265 --> 48:58.849
Yeah, I have a very
busy morning.

48:58.933 --> 49:00.683
Just tell her I can't.
Good morning.

49:01.516 --> 49:04.015
Pam:
Frank, Frank, Frank!

49:04.099 --> 49:05.057
Fra--

49:06.766 --> 49:07.891
(door closes)

49:10.724 --> 49:12.391
I'm sorry, Dr. Tassone's
very busy this morning.

49:12.474 --> 49:13.474
Get out of my way, Mary Ann.

49:13.557 --> 49:15.140
-Pam, Pam.
-Please.

49:16.349 --> 49:18.015
You know what?
It's fine.

49:21.099 --> 49:22.182
Everything's fine.

49:44.099 --> 49:45.891
My exit interview for him.

49:53.265 --> 49:54.599
(knock on door)

49:55.307 --> 49:56.808
-Hey.
-Jenny: Hey, Dr. Tassone.

49:56.891 --> 49:59.140
Uh, Mary Ann said
you wanted to see me?

49:59.224 --> 50:01.599
Frank: Yes, yes.
Uh, take a seat.

50:01.683 --> 50:03.557
Just close the door
behind you there.

50:08.933 --> 50:11.307
So, I think maybe

50:11.391 --> 50:14.265
it is time that we talked
about your value

50:14.349 --> 50:15.891
in this workplace.

50:18.849 --> 50:21.140
I, uh...

50:21.474 --> 50:23.391
-This isn't...
-No, rest assured,

50:23.474 --> 50:25.933
we all want you
to succeed here.

50:26.766 --> 50:28.599
Which is--
(clears throat)

50:28.683 --> 50:32.683
Which is why we would like
to transition you

50:32.933 --> 50:35.224
to our special utilities
department.

50:36.808 --> 50:38.099
Oh.

50:38.599 --> 50:40.140
Sir, um...

50:40.224 --> 50:43.265
you know, I just thought I was
a really good fit up here.

50:43.349 --> 50:45.849
Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
We're just doing some shuffling

50:45.933 --> 50:48.265
and we could really use
an extra hand down there.

50:48.599 --> 50:49.891
Okay?

50:51.516 --> 50:54.432
What about Pam's old job?
You know, I thought maybe, uh,

50:54.516 --> 50:56.516
you know, like a manager,
maybe I could be--

50:56.599 --> 50:58.140
Maybe I could be right for that.

50:58.224 --> 50:59.641
Yeah, well, actually,
Philip Metzger's

50:59.724 --> 51:02.516
gonna be stepping in as
the interim business manager.

51:02.974 --> 51:04.557
-Phil the auditor?
-Yeah, yeah.

51:04.641 --> 51:07.599
I mean, until we can find
a more permanent
replacement for Pam.

51:07.683 --> 51:09.099
But...

51:09.808 --> 51:11.182
we're pretty excited about him.

51:15.599 --> 51:18.265
I think that I should, uh...

51:19.849 --> 51:21.307
think, um...

51:25.265 --> 51:28.599
I know what
you all did to Pam.

51:30.516 --> 51:32.516
And I could,
you know, I could...

51:33.432 --> 51:35.808
maybe tell people.

51:35.891 --> 51:38.391
Frank:
Sorry, hold on a second.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

51:38.474 --> 51:41.391
I just noticed that necklace
you have on.

51:41.474 --> 51:43.974
How it really
complements your eyes.

51:45.099 --> 51:46.891
-Thank you.
-It's, uh,

51:46.974 --> 51:48.391
yeah, that's,
that's new, isn't it?

51:48.474 --> 51:50.849
I don't think I've seen you
wearing it around before.

51:52.307 --> 51:54.766
Yeah, I thought so.
Yeah. I've got...

51:54.849 --> 51:57.099
I got sort of an eye for
these things, I don't know.

51:57.182 --> 51:58.808
So, um, what do you think?

51:58.891 --> 52:01.516
Is that-- is that
a Macy's purchase
or are we talking

52:01.599 --> 52:03.307
Lord & Taylor collection?

52:10.015 --> 52:11.766
Special utilities,
you said?

52:12.015 --> 52:14.015
Yeah, I think so.

52:15.808 --> 52:17.474
Okay, thanks, Jen.

52:21.641 --> 52:23.224
(door opens)

52:30.683 --> 52:32.015
(chuckles)

52:32.099 --> 52:33.516
(paper crumples)

52:37.974 --> 52:40.724
Mary Ann, can I get a cup
of that new coffee in here?

52:45.599 --> 52:46.891
(doorbell rings)

52:49.683 --> 52:50.933
Amber:
Oh, Rocco, you're so annoying.

52:51.015 --> 52:52.015
Get out of the way.

52:52.724 --> 52:54.182
Go.

53:05.766 --> 53:07.516
-Mom!
-Pam: This is she.

53:07.599 --> 53:09.099
(woman on phone, indistinct)

53:09.182 --> 53:10.265
No.

53:10.933 --> 53:12.015
Wait, what?

53:12.391 --> 53:15.557
Yeah, thank you.
Please don't call here again.

53:15.641 --> 53:17.015
-Who was that?
-That was a student.

53:17.099 --> 53:18.766
They want to donate
the fashion show proceeds

53:18.849 --> 53:21.015
to help pay for
my medical expenses.

53:21.557 --> 53:23.015
-But you're not sick.
-Don't eat that.

53:23.099 --> 53:24.099
We're returning them.

53:24.182 --> 53:26.599
Pam, what the hell
is going on?

53:29.557 --> 53:31.307
Bob: Okay, uh...

53:31.391 --> 53:33.057
first off, we want
to take a moment

53:33.140 --> 53:34.974
to acknowledge Pamela Gluckin.

53:35.599 --> 53:38.516
Uh, our hearts go out to her
and her entire family

53:38.599 --> 53:41.557
and we wish her a safe
and speedy recovery, yeah.

53:44.140 --> 53:46.182
Okay, all right, now.

53:46.265 --> 53:47.599
Onto the fun stuff.

53:49.391 --> 53:51.015
Look at these numbers, folks.

53:51.557 --> 53:54.015
These are the best
early decision numbers

53:54.099 --> 53:55.974
that we've ever seen.

53:56.432 --> 53:57.557
Yeah.

53:57.641 --> 53:59.474

Hey, Rachel, um,
where's the article

55:48.474 --> 55:50.391
on the
Cancer Benefit Fashion Show?

55:50.849 --> 55:52.766
I'll get that
to you tomorrow.

55:53.182 --> 55:54.766
But we go to print tomorrow.

55:55.391 --> 55:56.933
Okay, I'll have it tonight.

55:57.766 --> 55:59.557
Look, if you wanna be
a part of the paper,

55:59.641 --> 56:01.391
you gotta be a part
of the paper.

56:01.474 --> 56:03.015
Look, I'm gonna be late.

56:03.099 --> 56:04.599
Rachel. Rachel!

56:04.683 --> 56:06.224
(binder clatters)

56:06.766 --> 56:08.015
-Shit.
-Oh, my God.

56:08.099 --> 56:10.474
-Sorry, shit.
-Seriously?

56:14.933 --> 56:16.224
What is this?

56:16.307 --> 56:19.766
It's just a personal project.
None of your business.

56:24.265 --> 56:26.391
Look, I'm sorry
for being a hard-ass.

56:26.766 --> 56:28.808
I know you're going through
a lot at home.

56:28.891 --> 56:30.391
What's that supposed to mean?

56:31.766 --> 56:33.891
You know, just everything
with your dad.

56:34.599 --> 56:36.099
Yeah, what about him?

56:37.891 --> 56:39.891
I mean, the parents
talk to each other.

56:39.974 --> 56:42.641
I know that some shit
happened at work.

56:44.099 --> 56:45.432
You don't know anything.

56:45.724 --> 56:47.849
Ow.
Fuck, Rachel.

56:49.307 --> 56:51.307
(pop music playing on radio)

56:51.391 --> 56:53.516
(paper rustling)

57:13.808 --> 57:15.849
-(knocking)
-David: Rach?

57:17.057 --> 57:18.516
-Dinner.
-Okay.

57:20.599 --> 57:21.724
What's all this?

57:22.349 --> 57:24.015
Uh, research.

57:24.099 --> 57:26.849
These are invoices
from the school district.

57:34.683 --> 57:36.015
(chuckles)

57:36.099 --> 57:38.349
The school district invoiced
over a million dollars

57:38.432 --> 57:39.808
in lab equipment?

57:41.391 --> 57:42.891
And that's just one supplier.

57:43.766 --> 57:44.849
(chuckles)

57:46.391 --> 57:48.349
You thought about
calling this company?

57:52.307 --> 57:54.516
(television playing, indistinct)

58:00.933 --> 58:02.766
Oh, God, I'm gonna
miss my flight.

58:03.182 --> 58:04.974
Not if you stay another day.

58:05.224 --> 58:06.933
You know I can't do that.

58:07.015 --> 58:08.391
(groans)

58:10.140 --> 58:11.849
You could get a job here.

58:13.641 --> 58:15.641
There are schools
in Clark County.

58:15.724 --> 58:17.057
Sure, but good ones?

58:18.140 --> 58:20.015
Was Roslyn any good
before you?

58:29.933 --> 58:33.307
Hi, is this Champion Products
in Uniondale?

58:33.391 --> 58:35.307
-Man (on phone): Yes, it is.
-Hi, my name is Rachel.

58:35.391 --> 58:36.974
I was just hoping to ask you
about a series of charges.

58:37.057 --> 58:38.349
Okay, yes, yes.
Thank you for
verifying, Felice.

58:38.432 --> 58:39.641
You've been a huge help.

58:39.724 --> 58:41.599
-Yeah.
-Thank you, bye-bye.

58:42.974 --> 58:44.224
That's right.

58:46.224 --> 58:47.432
Yeah, I can hold.

58:51.599 --> 58:53.599
(phone rings)

58:56.432 --> 58:59.265
Howard:
Bellmore Fine Auto,
this is Howard.

59:00.349 --> 59:03.557
Uh, I'm sorry.
Bellmore Fine Auto?

59:03.641 --> 59:07.641
I had this number listed
as an H.G. Consulting.

59:24.182 --> 59:25.766
Pam: Hi.

59:26.974 --> 59:28.140
What's the matter?

59:28.516 --> 59:31.599
Oh, nothing,
I'm just, just tired.

59:32.349 --> 59:33.933
I'll take those invoices.

59:43.224 --> 59:45.891
David:
Next up is WordPower Tech.

59:46.474 --> 59:49.599
Now, they billed
the school district $800,000

59:49.683 --> 59:51.724
but no one has any idea
who they are.

59:51.808 --> 59:53.015
And they're consistent.

59:53.099 --> 59:55.182
They've billed every year
for the past ten.

59:55.265 --> 59:57.849
Yeah, the company's registered
to Thomas Tuggiero

59:57.933 --> 59:59.391
with an address in Manhattan.

59:59.474 --> 01:00:01.891
I tried calling but the number
is disconnected.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.474
We're gonna leave that one
a question mark for right now

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:08.265
because the next one I've got
is Porto Office Supplies.

01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:10.849
Now, I can't find any...

01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:13.057
(train rumbling)

01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:28.182
(whistle tweets)

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.724
Man:
What, did you forget your key?

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:27.766
Oh.

01:01:28.432 --> 01:01:29.641
Hello.

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:35.099
Can I help you with something?

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:36.766
Is this...

01:01:38.766 --> 01:01:40.432
Uh, I'm...

01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:41.974
I'm canvassing.

01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:44.099
For who?

01:01:48.516 --> 01:01:50.599
Oh, um, it's...

01:01:50.933 --> 01:01:52.891
I'm, I have the wrong apartment.

01:01:52.974 --> 01:01:54.140
(scoffs)

01:02:06.933 --> 01:02:08.474
(elevator bell dings)

01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:36.808
(door closes)

01:02:39.974 --> 01:02:41.683
You're back.

01:02:41.766 --> 01:02:44.307
I'm back.
Hey, thanks.

01:02:47.474 --> 01:02:48.683
Hey, what's for dinner?

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.724
Salmon.

01:03:00.015 --> 01:03:01.641
What's the matter?

01:03:03.182 --> 01:03:05.182
Oh, it's just work.
Sorry.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.891
The salmon's a little dry.

01:03:09.974 --> 01:03:11.224
It's great.

01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:14.641
I can tell when you're lying.

01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:21.265
A little dry, maybe.

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:23.140
The couscous, though,
is a small masterpiece.

01:03:23.224 --> 01:03:25.057
Oh, well, thank you very much.

01:03:25.516 --> 01:03:26.683
(chuckles)

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.391
How was Omaha?

01:03:33.057 --> 01:03:35.849
Mm, dull.
Dull as all hell.

01:03:38.891 --> 01:03:40.140
So...

01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:43.474
So I'm sitting there
sandwiched between
Doug and Joe

01:03:43.557 --> 01:03:45.766
and there's no A/C
in the conference center

01:03:45.849 --> 01:03:47.808
so you can imagine
the smell while they...

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:50.224
-Oh, God.
-...talked for hours

01:03:50.307 --> 01:03:54.307
about STEM programs
and state aid.

01:03:54.391 --> 01:03:55.849
It was, oh, yeah.

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:58.891
-It was, it was a riot.
-Oh, sounds like a nightmare.

01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.474
Maybe I'll come along next time.

01:04:03.557 --> 01:04:05.182
(chuckles)

01:04:05.724 --> 01:04:07.099
As a buffer.

01:04:10.224 --> 01:04:11.891
I would never
subject you to that.

01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:18.432
(Tom humming)

01:04:48.307 --> 01:04:50.432
(quiet chatter)

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:54.974
Okay, you have documents
to back this up?

01:04:55.307 --> 01:04:57.557
Years' worth of supposed
payments to vendors

01:04:57.641 --> 01:04:59.891
and confirmation
they were never received.

01:05:00.182 --> 01:05:02.057
Some of these companies,
they don't even exist.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.766
Well, no, you don't know that.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.557
I mean, you know
that for sure, right?

01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:07.849
WordPower Tech.

01:05:07.933 --> 01:05:09.641
They've billed the district
almost a million dollars

01:05:09.724 --> 01:05:11.307
and no one knows anything.

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:13.057
-Because it isn't anything.
-Okay.

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.766
It is a private apartment
on the upper East Side.

01:05:14.849 --> 01:05:16.849
-Yes, but that doesn't...
-And our superintendent

01:05:16.933 --> 01:05:18.974
-has the key.
-...necessarily
mean that it's fake.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.641
Come on, Nick,
you know what this is.

01:05:22.724 --> 01:05:25.224
If he hasn't reported this,
it's fraud.

01:05:25.307 --> 01:05:27.516
He's writing my college
recommendation letter.

01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:34.849
Fuck, fuck, god damn it.

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.849
What are we even
talking about right now?

01:05:39.891 --> 01:05:43.015
Are you sure?
Are you sure, sure, sure

01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:44.683
you actually wanna do this?

01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:50.307
(quietly reading)

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:17.474
Frank:
Mind if I join you?

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:29.224
(exhales)

01:06:30.724 --> 01:06:31.974
Don't ever let a doctor find out

01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:33.683
you have high
cholesterol, Rachel.

01:06:33.766 --> 01:06:35.891
They'll make you do
the most horrible things.

01:06:40.432 --> 01:06:41.557
So.

01:06:42.557 --> 01:06:43.766
About yesterday.

01:06:44.557 --> 01:06:46.015
Yeah, uh...

01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:49.224
-That was--
-What were you doing there?

01:06:51.099 --> 01:06:52.349
I'm not upset.

01:06:52.432 --> 01:06:55.224
But it is very important
that you be honest.

01:06:57.307 --> 01:07:00.307
I was following up
on the listed address

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:01.974
for a school contractor.

01:07:03.391 --> 01:07:04.766
Why were you doing that?

01:07:06.432 --> 01:07:08.349
It's public record.
Anyone could take the time--

01:07:08.432 --> 01:07:10.015
I didn't ask you
if it was public record.

01:07:10.099 --> 01:07:11.808
I-- I just asked you why.

01:07:15.808 --> 01:07:17.474
It's for something I'm writing.

01:07:19.766 --> 01:07:21.265
(exhales)

01:07:25.432 --> 01:07:27.182
I think you have real potential.

01:07:27.265 --> 01:07:29.265
-Dr. Tassone--
-No, I'm serious.

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:31.474
I, I read all your bylines.

01:07:31.557 --> 01:07:33.474
You've come such a long way
since past September.

01:07:33.557 --> 01:07:35.724
Your confidence,
strength of ability.

01:07:35.933 --> 01:07:37.474
-Thank you.
-No, you have a tremendous

01:07:37.557 --> 01:07:39.099
future ahead of you,
Rachel, you do.

01:07:39.182 --> 01:07:40.140
But...

01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:43.057
You're still young, too.
Which is why

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.766
you need to know,
and I mean this,

01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:47.808
if you go public...

01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:50.891
with something you
don't fully understand,

01:07:50.974 --> 01:07:53.683
it'll, it'll come back
on you hard.

01:08:13.099 --> 01:08:14.474
I don't know, I...

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.140
I guess it's our fault, mainly.

01:08:18.015 --> 01:08:19.890
We try to create
a safe environment

01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:21.265
for students to...

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:25.015
challenge, take risks,
make mistakes, grow.

01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:28.849
But this mistake,
if you make it,

01:08:29.557 --> 01:08:31.140
we will not
be able to protect you.

01:08:31.224 --> 01:08:35.057
Not me, not your teachers.
Because it'll change everything.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.724
And a lot of innocent people
will get hurt.

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:40.557
Right?

01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:42.765
I mean,
these kinds of inquiries

01:08:42.849 --> 01:08:45.640
are, are-- are like
setting off a grenade.

01:08:46.808 --> 01:08:49.140
There's fallout
in the pursuit.

01:08:50.057 --> 01:08:51.265
In the frenzy.

01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:53.015
There's collateral damage.

01:08:53.683 --> 01:08:55.015
Right-- (stammers)

01:08:55.099 --> 01:08:56.683
You must know all about that.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.057
It's not perfect,
but it works.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.015
What we have here works.

01:09:09.974 --> 01:09:11.557
I hope we can
keep it that way.

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.933
(soft music playing)

01:09:16.015 --> 01:09:19.099
♪ ♪

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.765
Teacher:
All right, let's get into it.
Uh, Rachel.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.640
Hey, Rachel.

01:09:50.224 --> 01:09:51.890
Rachel, are you still with us?

01:09:54.265 --> 01:09:55.641
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

01:09:55.933 --> 01:09:57.307
-Sorry.
-Teacher: All right.

01:09:57.391 --> 01:09:58.349
Question number four,

01:09:58.432 --> 01:09:59.808
what is the symbol
for potassium?

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.182
Anybody?

01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:03.432
(music intensifies)

01:10:09.516 --> 01:10:11.099
(knocking)

01:10:11.182 --> 01:10:12.265
Yeah.

01:10:14.057 --> 01:10:15.099
Hey, Frank.

01:10:16.182 --> 01:10:19.391
I've been doing some more
digging over the past week.

01:10:20.224 --> 01:10:22.474
I'm... concerned...

01:10:23.349 --> 01:10:25.057
with what I found.

01:10:25.766 --> 01:10:27.265
Okay, come in.

01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:31.516
Look, now we don't
have receipts,

01:10:32.057 --> 01:10:35.099
but some of these vendors,
they're...

01:10:38.474 --> 01:10:41.474
this Pam thing isn't
a question of $250,000

01:10:41.557 --> 01:10:42.974
like we'd initially thought.

01:10:44.849 --> 01:10:46.516
Well, okay, uh,

01:10:46.599 --> 01:10:48.724
do you have any sense
of what the number might be?

01:10:48.808 --> 01:10:51.599
I mean, are we talking 500?

01:10:51.683 --> 01:10:53.391
Are we talking a million?

01:10:53.474 --> 01:10:55.516
I mean, Phil, work with me.
I can't do anything but just--

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:57.140
I don't know, I don't know.

01:10:58.057 --> 01:11:00.307
You don't-- okay, fine.
So...

01:11:01.307 --> 01:11:02.557
figure it out, all right?

01:11:02.641 --> 01:11:03.974
Work your numbers magic
and then,

01:11:04.057 --> 01:11:06.766
let's the two of us deal
with it from there, okay?

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.224
Thanks, Phil.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:10.766
Well, there's something else.

01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:12.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:12.891 --> 01:11:16.307
A flight to London, Heathrow,
over winter break...

01:11:16.391 --> 01:11:17.641
-...billed to--
-Yeah, that's me.

01:11:17.724 --> 01:11:19.224
That flight was for me,
for the Pell Conference.

01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:20.599
You knew about the Pell.

01:11:20.683 --> 01:11:22.516
First class, Concorde jet.

01:11:23.182 --> 01:11:25.140
We, well, yeah.
I mean, look.

01:11:25.224 --> 01:11:28.432
I don't book the flights.
That's always been Jenny's job.

01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:31.307
-But look, even if I had--
-The charge is for two seats.

01:11:32.849 --> 01:11:35.683
Two seats side by side in first.

01:11:36.599 --> 01:11:39.349
It's $5,000
each way per ticket.

01:11:39.432 --> 01:11:41.182
It's $20,000.

01:11:42.808 --> 01:11:44.683
Yeah, well, that sounds
like a mistake.

01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:47.683
You know,
I called the airline.

01:11:52.015 --> 01:11:53.849
Who's Kyle Contreras?

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:00.432
(exhales)

01:12:01.808 --> 01:12:03.182
Wow.

01:12:04.557 --> 01:12:06.349
(exhales)

01:12:07.182 --> 01:12:10.057
Wow.
Okay, okay.

01:12:11.391 --> 01:12:13.057
So that's how
you wanna play it.

01:12:13.724 --> 01:12:14.849
What, no.
I'm not playing--

01:12:14.933 --> 01:12:16.265
Frank:
I mean, the audacity.

01:12:16.641 --> 01:12:19.015
Coming from the man
who spent six months

01:12:19.099 --> 01:12:22.307
falsifying our records
to mask his own negligence

01:12:22.391 --> 01:12:23.933
of fiduciary duty
to the school.

01:12:24.015 --> 01:12:26.557
Wait a second, that's not what,
that's not what's going on.

01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:27.557
No, no?

01:12:27.641 --> 01:12:29.391
Pam didn't
have to happen, right?

01:12:29.474 --> 01:12:31.683
You could have prevented that.
You're the auditor.

01:12:32.224 --> 01:12:34.140
The people here
pay you for what?

01:12:34.432 --> 01:12:36.933
So you can go off
and do your community theater

01:12:37.015 --> 01:12:39.099

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:41.933 --> 01:12:43.808
Oh, I can
point fingers too, Phil.

01:12:44.683 --> 01:12:46.099
Right, but I think we both agree

01:12:46.182 --> 01:12:48.265
that that wouldn't be a very
productive use of our time.

01:12:48.349 --> 01:12:50.099
-But--
-Phil.

01:12:50.849 --> 01:12:52.391
Are you gonna do your job,

01:12:52.474 --> 01:12:54.933
or do I have to call Hevesi
in here himself

01:12:55.015 --> 01:12:56.349
to come and do it for you?

01:12:56.432 --> 01:12:58.099
Because I will call him

01:12:58.182 --> 01:12:59.391
I will deal with it.

01:12:59.891 --> 01:13:01.599
I'm sorry that I brought it up.
I shouldn't have.

01:13:01.683 --> 01:13:03.641
Yeah, damn right
you shouldn't have.

You won't hear about it again.

And you don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

01:13:45.891 --> 01:13:47.641

Are you asking me
if I was a part of it?

No, I wasn't.

I promise you.

They were good people.

even out in the long run.

It was...

on Bell Boulevard.

Two Greek salads
and a fountain drink.

01:18:41.974 --> 01:18:44.766

01:24:05.265 --> 01:24:07.933
and all of a sudden,
you feel this thing behind you

01:24:08.015 --> 01:24:09.015
digging into your fender,

01:24:09.099 --> 01:24:10.474
and you look
into the mirror, right.

01:24:10.557 --> 01:24:12.516
And there's this hook.
There's a hook in your fender

01:24:12.599 --> 01:24:15.224
dug in real good,
and it's connected to a--

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.766
a long metal rope
and at the end of that rope

01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:20.432
is, well, it's a massive
five-ton cinder block.

01:24:20.516 --> 01:24:21.724
Okay, Chad?
All right?

01:24:21.808 --> 01:24:24.891
So your job is driving.
You're Dale Earnhardt

01:24:24.974 --> 01:24:27.057
and here's this cinder block,
and all the other cars

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.557
are soaring past you and

01:24:28.641 --> 01:24:30.057
you've gone from
first to last place

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.516
and you keep thinking
to yourself, "What the hell

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.182
do I have to do to
get this thing off my back?"

01:24:33.265 --> 01:24:34.724
Well, I'll tell you, Chad.
It's real simple.

01:24:34.808 --> 01:24:37.557
You just put your foot
on the gas real hard

01:24:37.641 --> 01:24:40.057
and you accelerate,
you accelerate so fast

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:43.057
that rope snaps in two,
the cinder block explodes,

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.391
and just say it with me, Chad.

01:24:44.474 --> 01:24:47.057
Accelerate.
Accelerate. Accelerate.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.849
-Chad: Accelerate?
-Yes.

01:24:50.641 --> 01:24:52.307
-Carol: Okay.
-Yes.

01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:55.140
Carol: What, what
is your problem, huh?

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.307
My problem?

01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:00.766
My problem is you.

01:25:01.766 --> 01:25:04.057
Carol, it's, it's,
it's the people who

01:25:04.307 --> 01:25:07.224
who trot their poor children out
like racehorses at Belmont.

01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:09.474
-Excuse me?
-Who derive some perverse joy

01:25:09.557 --> 01:25:12.224
out of treating us like
low-level service reps.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.766
-Carol: Okay--
-I mean, do you remember

01:25:13.849 --> 01:25:16.683
the teachers who sat with you,
who held you by the hand,

01:25:16.766 --> 01:25:18.432
-who taught you to add.
-Carol: No.

01:25:18.516 --> 01:25:20.432
And subtract,
or showed you Gatsby,

01:25:20.516 --> 01:25:22.766
Salinger for the first time.
"Mockingbird," even.

01:25:22.849 --> 01:25:24.683
Do, do their names
escape you?

01:25:24.766 --> 01:25:25.808
-Are their faces a blur?
-Okay.

01:25:25.891 --> 01:25:27.182
No, you listen to me!

01:25:29.307 --> 01:25:30.808
You don't wanna
see us as people

01:25:30.891 --> 01:25:33.516
because that is not
convenient for you.

01:25:33.808 --> 01:25:36.849
You just
leave us behind at will.

01:25:36.933 --> 01:25:38.557
Never think about us again.

01:25:38.974 --> 01:25:41.808
All right, you might forget,
but we don't.

01:25:42.182 --> 01:25:45.015
We never forget, ever.

01:25:48.432 --> 01:25:49.933
Chad:
What's wrong with him?

01:25:50.015 --> 01:25:51.432
Carol:
You know what, I don't know.

01:25:51.516 --> 01:25:53.599
I don't think anything's wrong.
We're gonna get some food

01:25:53.683 --> 01:25:55.140
and we're gonna go home, okay?

01:25:55.224 --> 01:25:56.891
-Chad: Mm-hmm.
-Carol: All right.

01:25:58.182 --> 01:25:59.724
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:26:12.057 --> 01:26:14.182

01:26:23.057 --> 01:26:25.224

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.015
-Dog food.
-Is my lawyer here yet?

01:26:52.099 --> 01:26:53.683
You're going away
for a long time, Pam.

01:26:53.766 --> 01:26:55.933
And not just you.
We've got enough here
to indict the whole family.

01:26:56.015 --> 01:26:59.099
-Don't you talk about them.
-And poor Jim especially.

01:26:59.391 --> 01:27:01.391
Just gettin' back
on his feet and all.

01:27:01.974 --> 01:27:03.974
You have any idea what
the job market looks like

01:27:04.057 --> 01:27:05.933
these days for ex-cons?

01:27:10.557 --> 01:27:11.974
You know...

01:27:12.057 --> 01:27:14.974
it may not be too late
for you to save them.

01:27:15.974 --> 01:27:17.140
Save your son.

What are you doing here?

01:27:29.933 --> 01:27:31.307
I wanted to see you.

01:27:34.974 --> 01:27:36.432
You don't have work?

01:27:37.099 --> 01:27:38.683
I quit.

01:27:41.391 --> 01:27:43.140

-Today.

01:27:43.933 --> 01:27:45.015
I just...

01:27:45.599 --> 01:27:47.766
just got on a plane
and now I'm here.

01:27:47.849 --> 01:27:50.432

No partners.

01:33:02.974 --> 01:33:04.891

half your corporation's earnings

01:33:06.474 --> 01:33:09.474

No, you, you can't...

01:33:20.057 --> 01:33:22.808

Everybody we spoke to
said Tassone

01:33:50.015 --> 01:33:52.182
did talk about a spouse,
a wife.

01:33:52.265 --> 01:33:53.891

01:35:58.557 --> 01:36:00.891
It was never the same between
the parents and teachers.

01:36:00.974 --> 01:36:02.808
They treated us differently
after that.

01:36:03.849 --> 01:36:05.140
Like we knew.

01:36:05.224 --> 01:36:06.766
Like we had
any idea at all.

01:36:07.182 --> 01:36:09.349
Of course we wish we would have
found out about this earlier.

01:36:09.432 --> 01:36:10.891
You know,
when things are going well,

01:36:10.974 --> 01:36:12.683
who wants to go huntin'
for problems?

01:36:20.349 --> 01:36:21.974
Man:
 He went out of his way.

01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:24.182
If we ever needed
anything from him

01:36:24.265 --> 01:36:26.015
he was there with a smile.

01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:28.182
So we were all happy.

01:36:28.891 --> 01:36:30.265
So we didn't ask questions.

01:36:30.349 --> 01:36:34.349
So you have this,
this liar and his boyfriend

01:36:34.432 --> 01:36:37.516
trotting around in the city
in God knows what.

01:36:38.557 --> 01:36:40.307
He just pulled the wool
over our eyes.

01:36:40.391 --> 01:36:42.724
You know, what can I say?
It's sick, it is.

01:36:42.808 --> 01:36:45.432
You think back over
the smaller moments,

01:36:45.516 --> 01:36:48.307
over the years
where he just seemed...

01:36:49.224 --> 01:36:51.140
I don't know, he just
seemed so real.

01:36:51.432 --> 01:36:52.849
So real.

01:36:55.432 --> 01:36:56.766
Oh, thanks.

 The outgoing seniors.

01:38:38.891 --> 01:38:41.849
They're going to the Ivy League
in unprecedented numbers.

01:38:43.891 --> 01:38:46.140
It was the first year on record

01:38:46.224 --> 01:38:50.057
that we had admission offers
from each school

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.683
going up!

01:38:53.516 --> 01:38:55.641
And what changed?

01:38:55.724 --> 01:38:57.432
What makes our
little public school

01:38:57.516 --> 01:39:00.557
so different from
all the others like ours
on Long Island?

01:39:00.641 --> 01:39:03.182
Let alone
in the country at large.

01:39:04.683 --> 01:39:06.349
At the end of the day,

01:39:06.432 --> 01:39:09.307
I think it boils down
to integrity.

01:39:10.015 --> 01:39:12.224
Integrity in our faculty,

01:39:12.307 --> 01:39:14.891
in our classrooms
and curriculum,

01:39:14.974 --> 01:39:17.974
and our approach
to a broad-minded,

01:39:18.057 --> 01:39:20.974
hands-on education.

01:39:21.057 --> 01:39:22.974
That's all the stuff
that gets thrown around

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:24.974
all the time, sure.

01:39:25.057 --> 01:39:27.432
But never in my career

01:39:27.516 --> 01:39:31.265
have I seen such passion
for all these factors.

01:39:31.349 --> 01:39:36.307
And then, paired with
the willingness to think big.

01:39:38.307 --> 01:39:40.391
You know why you're here.

01:39:40.474 --> 01:39:43.641
You know what this means
for our town.

01:39:43.724 --> 01:39:47.057
But I'm gonna tell you
about one man who's a hero

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:50.391
without whom none of this
would be possible.

01:39:50.474 --> 01:39:52.849
You don't get
to number one overnight.

01:39:52.933 --> 01:39:54.349
It takes years of hard work.

01:39:54.432 --> 01:39:56.140
And this is really a man

01:39:56.224 --> 01:39:58.349
who knows what it means
to work together.

01:39:59.557 --> 01:40:02.683

01:40:02.766 --> 01:40:05.015

(muffled dialogue)

01:40:06.891 --> 01:40:09.683

There was
no public outreach.

01:40:12.432 --> 01:40:14.224
There was no SkyWalk.

01:40:14.307 --> 01:40:17.641
This is a man who has given
the school so much.

01:40:17.724 --> 01:40:19.808
Woman: Magnificent.

01:40:19.891 --> 01:40:22.224
-Congratulations.

who whipped
our kids' schools into shape
