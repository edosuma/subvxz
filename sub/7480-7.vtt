01:15.732 --> 01:17.530
You sure it wasn't you?
Because the guy had

01:17.598 --> 01:18.908
your same little surfer drawl.

01:18.932 --> 01:21.197
Uh, I do not speak
with a drawl.

01:21.318 --> 01:22.584
The way you just said "drawl"?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.748
You said it with a drawl.
What are we talking about?

01:24.817 --> 01:28.620
Nothing. We are talking
about absolutely nothing.

01:28.687 --> 01:30.655
Someone called into
a talk radio show

01:30.722 --> 01:33.825
last night. Sounded
exactly like Deeks.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.427
Did he now?

01:35.495 --> 01:36.629
What was he calling about?

01:36.697 --> 01:39.064
Oh, he just wanted to
talk about his feelings.

01:39.132 --> 01:41.600
For a coworker.

01:45.039 --> 01:48.041
Don't you think it's strange
that Callen is a talk radio guy?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.911
Why's that?
I don't know,

01:50.978 --> 01:53.180
I've just always kind of
considered you more of a, uh...

01:53.247 --> 01:55.604
you know, a...

01:55.672 --> 01:59.275
TV static, white-noise
kind of guy.

01:59.343 --> 02:00.790
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

02:00.858 --> 02:02.946
Well, I am a man of mystery.

02:03.014 --> 02:04.326
Mystery or misery?

02:04.395 --> 02:06.481
Oh. It's going to be
that kind of day, isn't it?

02:06.549 --> 02:08.467
Buddy, you have no idea
how lucky you are

02:08.536 --> 02:09.579
to have a male partner.

02:09.646 --> 02:12.374
What is that supposed
to mean? Hmm?

02:12.442 --> 02:13.586
- I just...
- You know what?

02:13.655 --> 02:14.732
- Don't even answer that question.
- I'm not.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.917
Speaking of partners,
where is Sam?

02:16.984 --> 02:20.224
Mr. Always Five Minutes Early
is late again.

02:20.292 --> 02:22.805
And he's taken three long
weekends this month.

02:22.872 --> 02:24.459
You know what that means.

02:24.526 --> 02:26.774
He's in rehearsals for an
off-Broadway revival of <i>Cats.</i>

02:26.841 --> 02:28.296
I'll tell him you said that.

02:28.363 --> 02:30.248
You don't have to do that.

02:30.315 --> 02:31.803
Sounds like he's on
a new assignment.

02:31.870 --> 02:33.127
Is he on a new assignment?

02:33.193 --> 02:34.847
That is a question for Hetty.

02:34.914 --> 02:37.758
- You rang?
- Ooh. Hi, Hetty.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.492
Hi.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.261
So...

02:42.430 --> 02:43.764
Yes?

02:43.831 --> 02:46.434
Do you think Deeks
speaks with a drawl?

02:46.500 --> 02:51.605
Well, Mr. Deeks' intonation
certainly reflects

02:51.673 --> 02:53.841
the motley milieu
in which he was raised.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.410
But I have to admit,

02:55.510 --> 02:59.880
I find I'm rather fond
of his idiosyncrasies.

02:59.948 --> 03:01.216
Did you hear that?

03:01.283 --> 03:04.218
Hetty is rather fond
of my idiosyncrasies.

03:04.286 --> 03:05.726
Well, take it easy, Mr. Deeks.

03:05.794 --> 03:06.898
That was just a

03:06.966 --> 03:08.741
polite way of saying that

03:08.810 --> 03:11.589
I agree that you have a drawl.

03:14.002 --> 03:14.940
Well.

03:15.007 --> 03:16.581
On with it.

03:16.648 --> 03:17.653
On with what?

03:19.196 --> 03:22.881
- Your new case, of course.
- Aha.

03:24.725 --> 03:25.863
Save it.

03:25.932 --> 03:28.611
What? Hetty straight up
ganked my whistle?

03:31.192 --> 03:34.944
This was pulled from a Metro
security camera last night.

03:38.966 --> 03:41.577
The victim was Nori Ito,

03:41.645 --> 03:43.755
a Japanese accountant
who arrived in Los Angeles

03:43.823 --> 03:46.100
three days ago, along with a

03:46.168 --> 03:49.015
tourist group. He died
early this morning.

03:49.084 --> 03:52.733
The man giving Nori not quite
the warmest L.A. welcome

03:52.802 --> 03:55.811
is... Connor Maslin.

03:55.877 --> 03:57.133
He's a former Marine.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.820
How former is former?

03:58.886 --> 04:00.904
Maslin was discharged
earlier this year.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.822
He was administratively
separated.

04:02.890 --> 04:03.913
I'm assuming that's not
an honorable discharge.

04:03.980 --> 04:05.269
What did he do?

04:05.336 --> 04:08.444
Japanese authorities accused him
of sexually assaulting a woman

04:08.511 --> 04:09.999
while he was
stationed in Okinawa.

04:10.065 --> 04:12.249
And this second victim
is also Japanese?

04:12.316 --> 04:13.968
Could be a possible
hate crime.

04:14.035 --> 04:15.523
What else do we
know about Maslin?

04:15.590 --> 04:17.759
We have his home address
in Playa Del Rey,

04:17.826 --> 04:20.029
as well as a list of
his current employers.

04:20.095 --> 04:21.362
Employers? Plural?

04:21.430 --> 04:22.531
According to
what I found,

04:22.599 --> 04:24.500
he's currently
working three jobs.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.303
Well, you know what they
say about idle hands.

04:26.369 --> 04:28.504
Hetty wants us to locate Maslin.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.840
And bring him in quickly
so he can't hurt anyone else?

04:30.908 --> 04:32.441
And quietly,
because the military

04:32.510 --> 04:34.309
can't afford this
kind of publicity.

04:34.378 --> 04:35.911
That's actually exactly
what Hetty said,

04:35.979 --> 04:38.881
except with fancier words
and more syllables.

04:40.283 --> 04:42.517
All right, clock's ticking.
Let's get to it.

04:42.585 --> 04:45.356
Maslin's managed to stay
out of trouble for months.

04:45.424 --> 04:46.926
Why don't you to talk
to his employers, see if

04:46.993 --> 04:48.864
anything happened yesterday
that could've set him off.

04:48.931 --> 04:50.267
- Yeah.
- Done.

04:50.335 --> 04:51.870
Sam and I will visit his place.
I'll fill you in in the car.

04:51.938 --> 04:53.439
What's the two-second version?

04:53.508 --> 04:55.510
I don't think you're
going to like this guy.

05:02.293 --> 05:04.229
You want to know where
Connor Maslin is?

05:04.297 --> 05:05.566
Join the club.

05:05.632 --> 05:07.202
Begs for extra shifts
like a little girl,

05:07.270 --> 05:09.273
and then leaves me high and dry.

05:10.308 --> 05:11.477
Marisol!

05:11.544 --> 05:13.748
You going to clean up the
spill some time this week?

05:13.816 --> 05:15.419
<i>Si, señor.</i>

05:15.486 --> 05:17.055
Uh, has Connor ever
missed a shift before?

05:17.123 --> 05:18.257
Nope.

05:18.325 --> 05:20.956
Frankly, I had no beef
with him-- until today.

05:21.022 --> 05:22.854
What was he like?
Did Connor play nice

05:22.921 --> 05:24.085
with the other coworkers?

05:24.154 --> 05:26.285
Who's this guy? Dr. Phil?

05:26.351 --> 05:28.782
Did he ever get into a fight
with anyone? A customer, maybe?

05:28.850 --> 05:30.080
Not that I know of.

05:30.149 --> 05:31.747
He pretty much kept to himself.

05:31.815 --> 05:34.778
And in general,
he wasn't a pain in my...

05:34.845 --> 05:36.575
Marisol!

05:36.644 --> 05:38.735
Mop!

05:38.802 --> 05:40.230
He did work here
yesterday, right?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.423
Did he seem at all
off to you?

05:42.490 --> 05:44.050
Emotionally
unstable, maybe?

05:44.118 --> 05:45.911
This one make you sing
"Kumbaya" in the car?

05:46.012 --> 05:48.502
- All right.
- Just answer the question, please.

05:48.570 --> 05:49.931
Look.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.792
He punched in, he stocked
shelves for ten hours,

05:51.859 --> 05:53.122
he punched out.

05:53.189 --> 05:55.481
That's as "emotionally stable"
as I need him.

05:55.547 --> 05:58.205
Okay.

05:58.272 --> 06:00.001
If you think of anything else,

06:00.067 --> 06:02.228
anything useful...

06:04.260 --> 06:05.954
See ya.

06:06.023 --> 06:07.353
Bye.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.012
Don't worry. You're
nothing like Dr. Phil.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.343
Thank you.

06:12.412 --> 06:15.571
With that speech impediment,
you'd never make it on TV.

06:15.639 --> 06:18.099
Now, imagine having to
stock shelves all day

06:18.168 --> 06:19.298
and answer to that guy.

06:19.366 --> 06:21.361
Sounds almost as bad
as my gig as a lifeguard

06:21.428 --> 06:22.625
when I was in high school.

06:22.692 --> 06:24.014
Sorry, shouldn't you
have loved that?

06:24.079 --> 06:26.110
Well, I was at a pool,
got to have a God complex,

06:26.176 --> 06:27.659
plenty of skin, all true.

06:27.724 --> 06:29.174
But I was working at a YMCA,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.689
so I had to watch senior
citizens perform water aerobics.

06:31.755 --> 06:33.527
There was this woman,
I'll never forget her:

06:33.593 --> 06:35.010
Gertrude Norland. She was a

06:35.076 --> 06:37.203
big, big woman.
Skin condition.

06:37.269 --> 06:38.493
Overly flirty.

06:38.559 --> 06:39.783
Did she ever,
uh, you know...

06:39.848 --> 06:42.234
Pretend to be choking so
I would have to perform CPR?

06:42.299 --> 06:44.362
Yeah. She did.
All the time.

06:44.428 --> 06:46.684
It's probably the most action
you saw in high school.

06:46.749 --> 06:47.877
Okay. You know what?

06:47.943 --> 06:49.650
And that is why I
don't open up to you

06:49.716 --> 06:50.845
right there.
Hey.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.324
Hey. What do you got?

06:52.393 --> 06:55.774
Yeah, Maslin was a no-show
for at least one of his jobs.

06:55.845 --> 06:57.258
<i>Well, let me know if</i>
<i>he makes an appearance</i>

06:57.329 --> 06:58.431
<i>at his other two jobs.</i>

06:58.502 --> 06:59.467
Okay.

06:59.536 --> 07:02.607
Our boy on the run?

07:02.677 --> 07:04.747
Maybe.

07:07.508 --> 07:08.992
Got a late start
this morning.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.580
Huh. If you say so.

07:11.650 --> 07:14.512
Been a lot of late
starts lately, huh?

07:16.238 --> 07:18.101
You know, they say coffee
usually does the trick.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.241
Yeah, well, Hetty just
got me a new coffeemaker.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.747
Except this one takes an
extra long time to brew.

07:23.814 --> 07:26.052
Waiting can be
the hardest part.

07:26.119 --> 07:27.502
Can take a lot out of you.

07:27.569 --> 07:29.478
The waiting,
I can deal with.

07:29.545 --> 07:31.851
But this, uh, coffeemaker
came with a special mug.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.992
An incredibly stunning mug.

07:34.058 --> 07:35.936
Ah.

07:36.002 --> 07:37.320
That can be tricky.

07:38.226 --> 07:39.947
'Cause if you get
distracted by the mug...

07:40.310 --> 07:41.358
I know.

07:41.359 --> 07:44.515
- Or if you let things heat up...
- I know.

07:44.582 --> 07:46.126
That's when you get burned.

08:02.820 --> 08:03.928
Clear.

08:03.995 --> 08:05.942
Clear!

08:06.011 --> 08:07.823
Hospital corners.

08:07.892 --> 08:09.670
At least the military
taught Maslin something.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.987
Place is immaculate.

08:12.055 --> 08:14.002
Whoever broke in here
didn't look very hard.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.441
Maybe because what they were
looking for was Connor Maslin.

08:23.975 --> 08:26.306
No plates.

08:26.376 --> 08:29.289
New to town and lost?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.108
Something tells me
they're not waiting around

08:31.177 --> 08:32.514
for a Thomas Guide.

08:44.381 --> 08:46.814
Apparently, we're not
the only one looking for him.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.303
Okay. Nell is helping Eric
locate the black Caddy

09:04.304 --> 09:06.017
you saw outside of
Maslin's apartment.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.388
No dice yet.

09:07.458 --> 09:10.269
That SUV was waiting for
Connor Maslin to show his face.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.807
I'm going out on a limb here,
but could it be connected

09:12.877 --> 09:15.481
to the Japanese tourist
that Maslin just beat to a pulp?

09:15.552 --> 09:17.334
Something tells me these guys
weren't exactly

09:17.404 --> 09:18.432
the tour group type.

09:18.501 --> 09:20.650
Maslin stole Nori Ito's wallet.

09:20.718 --> 09:22.237
Well, maybe he
owes people money.

09:22.306 --> 09:23.958
And the Caddy was
there to collect.

09:24.025 --> 09:26.736
Kind of coincidental he chose
to rob a Japanese person.

09:26.803 --> 09:28.688
Hey. I've been tracking
Maslin's accounts.

09:28.755 --> 09:30.209
He just used his credit card.

09:30.277 --> 09:31.666
- Where?
- Culver City.

09:31.732 --> 09:33.054
At a gun shop.

09:33.121 --> 09:34.609
Wow. Somebody just
upped the ante.

09:34.677 --> 09:35.932
Find him. And once you do,

09:35.999 --> 09:37.982
don't take your eyes off him.

09:38.050 --> 09:40.959
We got eyes yet, Eric?
I'm driving blind out here.

09:41.027 --> 09:43.638
Doing the best I can.
This guy is a ghost.

09:43.705 --> 09:45.672
Maslin took a beating
last night, too,

09:45.740 --> 09:48.108
so look for someone wearing
sunglasses, hiding his bruises.

09:48.177 --> 09:50.110
And long sleeves
to cover his hands.

09:50.177 --> 09:52.479
All right. Found him.
He's on foot,

09:52.547 --> 09:53.847
east side of the boulevard,

09:53.915 --> 09:55.682
headed north a block
in front of you.

09:55.751 --> 09:57.984
I'm sending the coordinates
to your phones now.

09:58.053 --> 09:59.585
Got it.

09:59.653 --> 10:02.555
Keep eyes on him just in case.

10:02.623 --> 10:04.090
There he is. White shirt.

10:19.437 --> 10:20.704
What are you looking at?

10:20.772 --> 10:22.039
Nothing.

10:22.106 --> 10:24.507
- Is there a problem?
- No. It's just...

10:24.576 --> 10:26.877
noticed you guys are
wearing the same shirt.

10:26.945 --> 10:28.580
So? Man has taste.

10:28.646 --> 10:31.049
I'd say maybe he's pulling it
off a little better than you.

10:31.117 --> 10:32.817
Ha. You giving me
fashion tips?

10:32.886 --> 10:34.814
- Focus.
- I am focused.

10:34.882 --> 10:36.377
I'm the one that
noticed the shirt.

10:36.444 --> 10:39.105
Yeah? Remind me again how
you pronounce Balenciaga?

10:39.173 --> 10:41.501
The fact that you even know
that word is very unsettling.

10:47.358 --> 10:49.353
Connor, you're going to
want to, but do not run.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.650
I'm a Federal agent, NCIS.

10:52.780 --> 10:55.607
I'm about as good a friend
as you've got right now.

11:11.843 --> 11:14.404
Eric, black Caddy
headed east on Weddington.

11:14.470 --> 11:15.801
Already got it.

11:15.869 --> 11:17.564
Try not to lose them.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.461
Please.

11:19.528 --> 11:21.557
You're really a federal agent?

11:21.625 --> 11:24.552
Considering the alternative,
I don't sound so bad, do I?

11:24.621 --> 11:26.150
Come on!

11:29.112 --> 11:30.908
The man you beat up
is dead.

11:30.975 --> 11:32.250
What?

11:32.318 --> 11:33.693
Nori Ito died
in the ambulance

11:33.761 --> 11:35.035
on the way to
the hospital.

11:35.103 --> 11:36.177
Makes you
a murderer.

11:36.245 --> 11:37.753
It was self-defense.

11:37.822 --> 11:41.075
You beat him up,
and then you stole his wallet.

11:41.143 --> 11:42.987
I mean,
he stole my wallet.

11:43.056 --> 11:44.699
I was just
getting it back.

11:44.768 --> 11:47.350
So the guy you beat to
death was a pickpocket.

11:47.418 --> 11:49.967
You're going to have
to do better than that.

11:50.035 --> 11:51.578
It's the truth. I swear.

11:51.646 --> 11:53.691
Why would a Japanese tourist
steal your wallet?

11:53.760 --> 11:55.672
Well, maybe he
wanted a souvenir.

11:55.739 --> 11:58.792
Oh. They ran out of
Hollywood sign snow globes.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.368
I like those.

12:00.436 --> 12:01.737
Okay, Marine.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.306
You've had run-ins with
the Japanese in the past.

12:04.374 --> 12:05.741
Like your discharge
for assaulting

12:05.809 --> 12:07.276
a young woman in Okinawa.

12:07.343 --> 12:08.744
I never assaulted anyone.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.945
Really?

12:10.046 --> 12:11.647
'Cause it says right here...
well, Sam,

12:11.715 --> 12:13.048
maybe I'm reading
this wrong.

12:13.116 --> 12:15.117
That woman
is my girlfriend.

12:16.252 --> 12:18.120
Her father forbid us
from seeing each other,

12:18.187 --> 12:20.488
but we ignored him.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.491
Romeo and Juliet.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.725
I would never
hurt a woman,

12:25.793 --> 12:27.993
especially
not Maeko.

12:28.061 --> 12:31.715
Her father, Akio Tanaka,
created these trumped-up charges

12:31.785 --> 12:33.984
so I'd be transferred
back to the States.

12:34.053 --> 12:37.403
Billionaire environmentalist
of the year, Akio Tanaka?

12:39.807 --> 12:42.142
He had arranged for Maeko
to marry some politician

12:42.210 --> 12:44.445
to secure kickbacks
for his business.

12:44.512 --> 12:46.306
I was getting in the way
of his grand plan,

12:46.375 --> 12:47.661
so he made me
pay for it.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.151
This is all very convenient.

12:49.218 --> 12:50.844
That's an awful lot of effort.

12:50.912 --> 12:52.604
The guy's got an
answer for everything.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.413
He has had enough time to
get his story straight.

12:55.482 --> 12:57.580
All right,
I'm calling LAPD Evidence,

12:57.648 --> 13:00.220
figure out what happened
to Nori Ito's wallet.

13:00.290 --> 13:02.392
It was never mentioned
in the coroner's report.

13:02.459 --> 13:04.561
I just don't see
the connection

13:04.627 --> 13:06.796
between what happened
on the subway platform

13:06.863 --> 13:10.641
and the fact that maybe he
had a girlfriend in Japan.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.252
Maybe he's got a story
for that, too.

13:12.319 --> 13:13.336
Hey, it's Deeks.

13:13.403 --> 13:15.309
I hate to break it to you pal,

13:15.376 --> 13:17.346
but there's not a whole hell
of a lot you can do

13:17.413 --> 13:18.627
when you're here
and she's over in Japan.

13:18.695 --> 13:19.778
After I was
transferred,

13:19.844 --> 13:21.388
Maeko came here
to be with me.

13:21.456 --> 13:23.295
When Tanaka found out,
he sent his men

13:23.362 --> 13:25.629
to bring her home
and to teach me a lesson.

13:25.695 --> 13:28.226
You're saying the man you killed
worked for Tanaka?

13:28.325 --> 13:30.342
That's my guess.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.187
What about the guys
in the black Caddy?

13:33.255 --> 13:35.570
Probably also
on Tanaka's payroll.

13:36.596 --> 13:38.382
Where is Maeko now?

13:38.449 --> 13:42.385
Hiding out at my buddy's trailer
in Malibu.

13:42.452 --> 13:43.939
It's parked
at Malibu Creek.

13:44.007 --> 13:45.726
Will you make sure
she's okay?

13:45.793 --> 13:48.803
We'll start by making sure
she's there at all.

13:50.822 --> 13:52.408
You say you're not a threat.

13:52.476 --> 13:54.526
You're not dangerous.

13:54.593 --> 13:56.476
Then how do you explain
putting a down payment

13:56.543 --> 13:58.362
on a gun this afternoon?

13:58.430 --> 14:00.643
I need to protect Maeko
from her father.

14:00.712 --> 14:03.595
Now, I'm telling you,
Akio Tanaka is not the man

14:03.663 --> 14:05.643
<i>Time</i> magazine
makes him out to be.

14:07.322 --> 14:09.468
Yeah, okay.
All right.

14:09.536 --> 14:11.381
Thanks, Miguel. That was
my buddy in LAPD Evidence.

14:11.448 --> 14:12.656
Turned out that Nori Ito

14:12.724 --> 14:14.535
didn't have a wallet on him
when he died.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.482
Oh. What are the
chances Maeko Tanaka

14:16.550 --> 14:17.489
is hiding out in Malibu?

14:17.557 --> 14:18.663
I'd say zero to none.

14:18.731 --> 14:20.340
Yeah, we still have
to check it out.

14:20.409 --> 14:21.381
Road trip to the 'Bu?

14:21.449 --> 14:22.689
Please don't call it that.

14:22.758 --> 14:24.735
It just encourages the people
who live there.

14:24.803 --> 14:27.084
But I really want to be a member
of the 'Bu-Tang Clan.

14:27.152 --> 14:28.819
Please make him stop.

14:30.656 --> 14:34.559
Let's see if anything Maslin
told us actually holds water.

14:45.071 --> 14:47.274
<i>Maeko Tanaka gave up</i>

14:47.342 --> 14:49.076
a penthouse
in Japan for this?

14:49.144 --> 14:51.912
That's assuming she had
a choice in the matter.

15:00.490 --> 15:02.491
Federal agents!

15:14.469 --> 15:16.504
Don't see any bags
or suitcases.

15:16.572 --> 15:18.105
Or a sign
that any female

15:18.173 --> 15:19.974
has ever stepped
foot in here.

15:21.009 --> 15:23.177
Maybe Connor
and his buddy

15:23.245 --> 15:25.947
are starting a little
something on the side?

15:26.015 --> 15:29.349
That's the most believable thing
I've heard all day.

15:30.386 --> 15:33.482
Nell, no sign of Maeko here.

15:33.553 --> 15:36.966
There's no sign
of Maeko Tanaka anywhere.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.267
What do you mean?

15:38.339 --> 15:39.887
Well, I checked
with Immigration

15:39.957 --> 15:42.244
and Border Control twice.

15:42.316 --> 15:47.064
Maeko Tanaka's never set foot
in this country.

15:58.253 --> 15:59.941
Well, we spoke
to your buddy.

16:00.013 --> 16:02.088
Confirmed he was letting
you use his trailer.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.657
But he's never heard
of any Maeko Tanaka.

16:04.729 --> 16:06.170
Well, that's 'cause
I didn't tell him

16:06.242 --> 16:07.472
in order
to protect her.

16:07.545 --> 16:09.091
There was no one
in the trailer.

16:10.923 --> 16:13.024
They... they must
have found her.

16:13.091 --> 16:14.692
Or she was never here.

16:14.759 --> 16:16.593
There's no record
of any Maeko Tanaka

16:16.661 --> 16:19.030
ever entering this country.

16:19.098 --> 16:20.465
Well, that's because
I smuggled her

16:20.531 --> 16:22.066
into the U.S. from Vancouver.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.034
It was the only way
to keep her safe

16:24.103 --> 16:26.004
and from being sent back
to her father.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.872
This is getting a little
melodramatic, don't you think?

16:27.939 --> 16:29.207
Here's our
problem, Connor.

16:29.274 --> 16:31.242
When we first saw you, you ran.

16:31.310 --> 16:32.776
That's never a good sign.

16:32.844 --> 16:34.111
And nothing we've turned up

16:34.178 --> 16:36.045
supports a single thing
you've told us.

16:36.114 --> 16:38.281
Not the wallet,
not the girl, nothing.

16:38.349 --> 16:40.117
I don't know what to tell you.

16:40.184 --> 16:42.251
Please find her.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.853
She doesn't want to go back.

16:43.922 --> 16:44.987
That's the truth.

16:45.089 --> 16:46.323
Well,
it'd better be,

16:46.390 --> 16:48.993
or you're going to jail
for a very long time.

16:49.061 --> 16:52.863
So long that I bet you'll wish
you got in that black Caddy.

17:04.244 --> 17:05.678
Any luck?

17:05.746 --> 17:07.780
I don't know if you
can call it luck.

17:07.847 --> 17:10.281
Connor fed us yet another
chapter in his story.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.751
Who knows what to believe
at this point?

17:12.819 --> 17:14.353
Simple.

17:14.421 --> 17:18.990
If there are theoretical holes
in the proverbial story,

17:19.058 --> 17:20.590
then answer them.

17:20.659 --> 17:21.826
Thanks, Hetty, but this one

17:21.893 --> 17:23.828
is slightly more complicated
than that.

17:23.896 --> 17:27.589
Mr. Callen, it's never
more complicated than that.

17:27.656 --> 17:29.985
We don't even know if Maeko
is actually in the States.

17:30.054 --> 17:31.484
And if she is,
like Connor said,

17:31.552 --> 17:33.217
she could be being
held against her will.

17:33.284 --> 17:34.848
Whoever was driving
that black Caddy

17:34.915 --> 17:37.145
has certainly taken
an interest in Maslin.

17:37.212 --> 17:38.776
I'm just going
to put it out there--

17:38.844 --> 17:40.641
he may be a liar,
but I'm not getting

17:40.708 --> 17:42.272
an aggro hate crime vibe
from this guy.

17:42.339 --> 17:43.536
These all sound

17:43.605 --> 17:45.334
like outstanding places
to start.

17:45.403 --> 17:48.930
I look forward
to their swift resolution by...

17:48.998 --> 17:52.093
mm, let's say tomorrow?

17:54.392 --> 17:56.625
Maeko Tanaka may not be
in the country,

17:56.694 --> 17:58.429
but her father is.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.664
And he's been here
since Saturday.

18:00.732 --> 18:01.899
He's attending an event

18:01.965 --> 18:04.401
at the Japanese Cultural
Center this afternoon.

18:05.904 --> 18:07.638
Could be a coincidence.

18:07.705 --> 18:10.408
Could be a lot of things.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.813
12:00.

18:15.882 --> 18:17.883
That's him.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.867
Akio Tanaka?

18:35.935 --> 18:36.869
Yes?

18:36.936 --> 18:37.870
Federal Agent
Callen.

18:37.937 --> 18:40.238
NCIS. This is
my partner, Sam Hanna.

18:41.373 --> 18:44.343
How can I be of assistance,
Officers?

18:44.411 --> 18:47.012
- What brings you to Los Angeles?
- Business.

18:47.079 --> 18:48.446
What is this about?

18:48.514 --> 18:49.748
It's about your daughter.

18:50.783 --> 18:52.416
My daughter?

18:52.485 --> 18:54.219
What about her?

18:54.287 --> 18:55.521
How is she?

18:55.588 --> 18:56.689
Very well.

18:56.756 --> 18:59.157
Do you know
where she is?

18:59.226 --> 19:02.928
She's home, giving a particular
South Korean rail line

19:02.996 --> 19:04.797
hell over contract terms.

19:04.865 --> 19:06.198
She's in Japan?

19:06.266 --> 19:08.565
Why the interest in my daughter?

19:08.633 --> 19:10.532
Do you have a number
where we could reach her?

19:10.599 --> 19:12.398
Right now?

19:12.464 --> 19:16.297
As I mentioned, she
is rather busy at the moment.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.530
And with the time
difference...

19:17.598 --> 19:19.163
It's 7:30 in the morning there.

19:19.232 --> 19:21.930
With Maeko being a worker bee,
I'm sure she's wide awake.

19:59.796 --> 20:01.494
Maeko-san.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.027
And for yours.

20:29.093 --> 20:31.292
Apologize
for the intrusion.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.825
Enjoy your stay
in Los Angeles.

20:38.460 --> 20:39.991
Yo.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.831
Eric, see if you can trace
the last call Tanaka made.

20:42.897 --> 20:44.051
Let me know when you do.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.371
I got it.
All right.

20:45.437 --> 20:46.855
So how many
holes is that

20:46.922 --> 20:48.372
in Connor Maslin's
story now?

20:48.439 --> 20:49.823
Enough to sink him.

20:49.891 --> 20:51.804
Yes.

20:51.870 --> 20:54.178
I don't like the
looks of this.

20:54.246 --> 20:55.367
Well, then,
you're really not

20:55.434 --> 20:56.883
going to like
the sound of it.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.269
- Right.
- What's going on?

20:58.336 --> 20:59.423
The State Department

20:59.491 --> 21:01.172
has suddenly gotten
involved in our case

21:01.239 --> 21:03.153
and has graciously requested
NCIS stand down.

21:03.219 --> 21:04.143
Yes, sir.

21:04.210 --> 21:06.618
- Stand down?
- Yeah.

21:06.685 --> 21:07.952
As in

21:08.020 --> 21:09.755
withdraw, acquiesce,

21:09.823 --> 21:12.626
retrocede, cease and desist.

21:12.694 --> 21:14.795
Your thesaurus
runneth deep, Hetty.

21:14.864 --> 21:19.604
And your drawl
still runneth over, Mr. Deeks.

21:19.672 --> 21:21.507
The State Department
wants us to stand down?

21:21.574 --> 21:25.212
Excellent.
Now we're all on the same page.

21:25.278 --> 21:28.883
This is Akio Tanaka's handiwork.

21:28.951 --> 21:32.653
Make no mistake
how deep his contacts run

21:32.721 --> 21:35.090
within our government.

21:37.728 --> 21:39.062
Why would Tanaka
have us taken

21:39.129 --> 21:40.931
off the case
if he has nothing to hide?

21:40.998 --> 21:42.432
Because, at this point,
it's the word

21:42.501 --> 21:43.968
of a well-respected,
well-connected businessman...

21:44.036 --> 21:45.579
Against a dishonored,
discharged Marine

21:45.646 --> 21:47.021
who we watched
commit murder.

21:47.089 --> 21:48.364
About that?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.041
You should see this.

21:52.626 --> 21:54.303
We already have.

21:54.372 --> 21:57.928
Yeah, but you left
before the final credits.

21:59.976 --> 22:02.895
And that's not Maslin,
because he's on the train.

22:02.964 --> 22:05.377
Wow, good Samaritans
do exist in L.A.

22:05.446 --> 22:06.921
And he's cute, too.

22:06.989 --> 22:08.431
You think he's a doctor?

22:08.499 --> 22:10.780
Just keep watching.

22:13.734 --> 22:16.384
I'll never meet anyone, will I?

22:19.474 --> 22:20.882
Really?

22:20.949 --> 22:22.291
You guys can't even muster up

22:22.359 --> 22:24.103
the "lots of fish in the sea"
speech?

22:24.171 --> 22:25.311
No? All right.

22:25.379 --> 22:26.822
Let's just concentrate
on the case.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.626
So, Nori Ito had
two wallets on him

22:28.696 --> 22:30.184
when he was
at the subway station.

22:30.257 --> 22:32.134
Maybe the one
that Connor took was his own.

22:32.207 --> 22:34.120
That's the first thing
Connor Maslin told us

22:34.191 --> 22:35.430
that's actually panned out.

22:35.502 --> 22:37.167
But...

22:37.239 --> 22:38.372
But?

22:38.443 --> 22:40.003
Look who he's up against.

22:40.074 --> 22:41.384
Tanaka makes one phone call,

22:41.456 --> 22:43.582
and a federal investigation
is DOA.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.389
Semper Fi.

22:45.461 --> 22:47.551
Tanaka and
the State Department

22:47.624 --> 22:50.387
forced us to choose sides.

22:50.459 --> 22:53.116
I'll side with
a Marine every time.

23:06.638 --> 23:07.877
This is bull.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.365
Yep.

23:09.438 --> 23:11.351
- What are we gonna do about it?
- I'm thinking.

23:11.422 --> 23:13.088
All right, we did
a little more digging

23:13.159 --> 23:14.789
into Tanaka's business dealings.

23:14.859 --> 23:17.021
Even though the State Department
told us to stand down?

23:17.092 --> 23:19.527
Well, we figured we do
our due diligence in the case

23:19.595 --> 23:21.929
in case they ask us about
our involvement in the case.

23:21.997 --> 23:23.931
There is no case at this point.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.433
Tanaka is here to try
and win a bidding war

23:26.501 --> 23:28.369
for a multi-million-dollar
government contract

23:28.436 --> 23:30.738
for underwater
fiber optic cable installation.

23:30.805 --> 23:31.806
So he's here legitimately?

23:31.873 --> 23:33.241
It looks that way.

23:33.308 --> 23:35.243
Well, and we know his daughter,
Maeko, is still in Japan.

23:35.311 --> 23:36.878
Actually, we don't know that.

23:36.946 --> 23:39.248
I thought Sam spoke
to her this morning.

23:39.315 --> 23:41.784
Sam spoke to a woman claiming
to be Tanaka's daughter.

23:41.852 --> 23:43.219
And even if it was Maeko,

23:43.287 --> 23:44.587
how do we know she was in Japan

23:44.656 --> 23:45.889
and not coming
straight out of Compton?

23:45.956 --> 23:47.157
Compton?

23:47.224 --> 23:48.625
I said it for dramatic effect.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.861
Eric's still tracing
Tanaka's call.

23:51.929 --> 23:55.298
Well, what about
the Japanese tourist

23:55.366 --> 23:57.233
that was beaten to death?

23:57.301 --> 23:59.236
Nori Ito was identified

23:59.303 --> 24:01.471
by his brother, Takai,
this morning.

24:01.539 --> 24:03.808
Was his brother part of
the same tour group?

24:03.875 --> 24:05.109
Uh, no.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.813
Then his brother got here
pretty damn fast,

24:08.881 --> 24:11.649
considering Ito's been dead
for less than 24 hours.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.251
Eric, what are the chances

24:13.319 --> 24:15.187
we could break into
the morgue's surveillance?

24:15.254 --> 24:16.687
Slim to none.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.957
Unless you possess mad skills.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.592
What time was
the body identified?

24:20.661 --> 24:23.014
Uh, 11:38 this morning.

24:27.722 --> 24:30.108
One city morgue
coming right up.

24:30.175 --> 24:32.163
Thank you, Eric.

24:34.252 --> 24:35.709
It's a busy place.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.665
People are dying
to get in there.

24:39.092 --> 24:40.848
No?

24:40.915 --> 24:41.842
Come on,

24:41.909 --> 24:43.069
that's pure Catskills.

24:43.137 --> 24:44.395
You people have no appreciation
for the classics.

24:44.463 --> 24:46.782
Right there. Sam?

24:46.849 --> 24:49.070
That's one of the two guys
that were shadowing Maslin.

24:50.563 --> 24:53.647
The deeper we dig, the more
our Marine's story rings true.

24:55.172 --> 24:58.288
Where's Tanaka staying?

25:08.269 --> 25:11.715
I'm sorry, this entire floor
is occupied.

25:11.783 --> 25:12.975
Well, you still
need housekeeping.

25:13.042 --> 25:13.969
If we do,

25:14.037 --> 25:15.726
we'll call down.

25:15.793 --> 25:19.339
What about fresh towels
or a minibar?

25:19.406 --> 25:22.422
We'll contact you
if we require your services.

25:22.490 --> 25:25.061
Thank you.

25:25.129 --> 25:27.160
Let me know
if you need anything.

25:38.094 --> 25:40.631
Tanaka's got
the entire floor

25:40.700 --> 25:42.257
locked down.

25:42.324 --> 25:44.728
Time for plan D.

25:54.885 --> 25:56.543
No one here
ordered room service.

25:56.611 --> 25:58.710
Oh, it's compliments
of the hotel manager.

25:58.779 --> 26:00.674
This is an assortment
of seasonal fresh fruit,

26:00.742 --> 26:02.907
and this is a dessert sampler
that is highlighting

26:02.977 --> 26:04.464
the best pastry shops
in Beverly Hills.

26:04.533 --> 26:05.582
Yes, okay. Thank you.

26:05.650 --> 26:06.936
- Okay.
- We'll take it.

26:07.005 --> 26:08.121
It's okay. I can bring it.

26:08.189 --> 26:09.474
No, that won't
be necessary.

26:09.543 --> 26:10.896
It's actually not a problem.

26:10.964 --> 26:13.197
No, really.

26:13.266 --> 26:14.754
It's my job, sir.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.274
Not today.

26:20.839 --> 26:22.277
You need something else?

26:22.344 --> 26:24.796
Well, I wouldn't say
I technically need anything,

26:24.862 --> 26:27.838
but, um, it's usually
considered a nice gesture

26:27.904 --> 26:29.244
when services
are rendered that--

26:29.310 --> 26:31.174
That's very kind of you.
You didn't have to do that.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.319
But thank you so much.

26:32.385 --> 26:34.151
Be sure to try
the snickerdoodles,

26:34.216 --> 26:37.585
because it's like biting into
a little piece of heaven.

26:37.651 --> 26:39.055
You know what I mean?
Wonderful.

26:45.370 --> 26:46.677
I bet you got stonewalled, too.

26:46.745 --> 26:47.790
Quite the contrary.

26:47.855 --> 26:49.131
I thought those guys were great.

26:49.197 --> 26:50.672
They even tipped me.

26:50.740 --> 26:54.160
In fact, they even invited me
to hang out by the pool later.

26:54.228 --> 26:56.440
Ten bucks says
they got a cabaña.

26:56.508 --> 26:58.184
Let's see what
we got here.

27:00.131 --> 27:02.108
That room is bigger
than my house.

27:02.176 --> 27:04.422
And a lot cleaner.

27:05.898 --> 27:07.172
Look at that.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.514
Is that Maeko?

27:08.582 --> 27:10.560
That's her.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.572
That's Maeko Tanaka.

27:12.641 --> 27:15.308
Well, never underestimate
the power of free food.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.543
Seems like she's not
in Tokyo after all.

27:17.610 --> 27:19.410
Imagine that.

27:25.983 --> 27:27.717
There has to be something
you can do about this.

27:27.783 --> 27:30.585
Not if we want to keep our jobs.

27:30.654 --> 27:32.053
Director Vance

27:32.121 --> 27:34.988
has me on a very short leash.

27:35.055 --> 27:37.289
He's even threatened
to bring in

27:37.357 --> 27:39.090
an assistant director
to oversee

27:39.158 --> 27:43.459
West Coast operations
just to keep an eye on us.

27:43.527 --> 27:46.227
So we're supposed to forget
this ever happened?

27:46.296 --> 27:47.728
An illegal Japanese immigrant

27:47.796 --> 27:48.962
and the reputation

27:49.030 --> 27:51.131
of a former Marine
are hardly matters

27:51.199 --> 27:54.167
of national security.

27:54.234 --> 27:55.734
Is that so?

27:55.803 --> 27:58.069
A fire team

27:58.137 --> 28:00.404
is composed of three Marines
and their leader.

28:00.472 --> 28:03.572
Three fire teams
make a squad.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.773
Three squads make a platoon.

28:06.841 --> 28:09.808
Three platoons, a company.

28:09.876 --> 28:12.241
And so on and so on,

28:12.309 --> 28:14.175
all the way up to
an entire division.

28:14.243 --> 28:15.309
But it all starts

28:15.376 --> 28:16.510
with one Marine.

28:17.877 --> 28:20.910
SEALs never leave
a man behind.

28:20.977 --> 28:21.976
But that's exactly

28:22.045 --> 28:23.511
what we're doing.

28:25.546 --> 28:27.680
You know he's right, Hetty.

28:27.746 --> 28:31.147
Maeko is the only one that
can prove Connor is innocent.

28:31.215 --> 28:33.682
If we let Tanaka get away
with this, it's like saying that

28:33.749 --> 28:36.050
his money is worth more
than an innocent life.

28:38.085 --> 28:43.319
Why do I feel as if my short
leash is about to strangle me?

28:43.387 --> 28:46.088
You can't go at it

28:46.155 --> 28:48.689
guns blazing.

28:48.790 --> 28:52.127
Tanaka is a modern-day samurai,

28:52.197 --> 28:54.922
which means, to pull this off,

28:54.991 --> 28:58.294
you guys have to be
modern-day ninjas.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.236
Ninjas.

29:00.305 --> 29:06.507
No one can know this was us.

29:06.576 --> 29:09.268
Who's more discreet than us?

29:10.870 --> 29:13.290
Guys, we got something.

29:13.358 --> 29:16.050
Tanaka's pilot
just filed

29:16.120 --> 29:18.367
a flight plan with the FAA.

29:18.438 --> 29:19.799
He's leaving
Burbank International

29:19.868 --> 29:21.470
in one hour bound for Tokyo.

29:21.538 --> 29:23.752
Any additional women
listed on the manifest?

29:23.821 --> 29:26.581
Just one-- a Mrs. Kimi Ito.

29:26.651 --> 29:29.341
Her husband Nori's body
is being shipped back with them.

29:29.410 --> 29:32.237
Tanaka's trying to smuggle
his daughter, Maeko,

29:32.307 --> 29:34.520
out of the country
disguised as Ito's widow.

29:34.589 --> 29:36.184
Eric,

29:36.252 --> 29:38.561
do whatever it takes to slow
them down before they get

29:38.630 --> 29:40.091
to the airport.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.470
Tell Kensi to call Rose
at the L.A. Coroner's office.

29:44.540 --> 29:46.747
We're gonna need a favor.

29:46.815 --> 29:50.042
And you two are gonna need
a hall pass from Hetty.

30:33.188 --> 30:35.293
What in the world?

30:35.361 --> 30:38.282
All right, please remove
all shoes, hats, belts.

30:38.350 --> 30:39.605
Place them in a bin.

30:39.675 --> 30:41.542
Take your laptops
out of your cases

30:41.612 --> 30:43.173
and place them
in a separate bin.

30:43.243 --> 30:44.294
Thank you.

30:44.362 --> 30:45.617
I have a private plane.

30:45.685 --> 30:46.805
I'm afraid we're on

30:46.872 --> 30:48.262
a heightened threat level
today, sir.

30:48.331 --> 30:51.011
All passengers and planes
are being screened.

30:51.079 --> 30:52.944
I demand to speak
to your supervisor.

30:53.013 --> 30:56.099
Is there a problem here,
gentlemen?

30:56.168 --> 30:57.421
You're the supervisor?

30:57.490 --> 30:58.474
Uh-huh.

30:58.542 --> 31:00.304
I have my own plane.

31:00.374 --> 31:01.594
Hmm, lucky.

31:01.663 --> 31:03.901
Specifically so I
don't have to deal

31:03.970 --> 31:04.986
with this nonsense.

31:05.056 --> 31:06.656
Right. Well, Homeland Security

31:06.756 --> 31:09.491
has been alerted to the
possibility of a private plane

31:09.559 --> 31:11.425
being used in an act of terror,

31:11.494 --> 31:15.729
so all passengers, commercial
and private, must pass through

31:15.795 --> 31:17.162
all security checkpoints
until further notice.

31:17.231 --> 31:19.031
This is ridiculous.

31:19.099 --> 31:20.733
Well, you could
postpone your flight

31:20.800 --> 31:22.701
and wait until the
threat level has lowered.

31:22.770 --> 31:25.237
My plane is scheduled
to leave in 20 minutes!

31:25.305 --> 31:27.973
Then I suggest you start
taking off your shoes,

31:28.041 --> 31:30.976
because you're
holding up the line.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.960
Uh, arms out
for me, please.

31:52.028 --> 31:53.528
Thank you.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.266
We need a female agent!

32:00.334 --> 32:04.037
- Okay.
- What now?

32:04.105 --> 32:05.705
Right this way,
please, ma'am.

32:05.773 --> 32:07.507
Wh-Where is she going?
Uh-uh-uh.

32:07.575 --> 32:10.244
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait your turn, sir.

32:18.753 --> 32:20.053
Maeko?

32:20.121 --> 32:21.989
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye,

32:22.056 --> 32:23.590
NCIS.

32:23.658 --> 32:26.326
I need to ask you some questions
about Connor Maslin.

32:29.931 --> 32:31.364
All right,
please step back

32:31.432 --> 32:33.467
and remove all metal objects
out of your pockets.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.035
That's change, pens, keys.

32:35.103 --> 32:38.105
I have nothing in my pockets.

32:47.283 --> 32:48.850
Your machine is
malfunctioning.

32:48.918 --> 32:50.652
Put your arms out, please.

32:56.726 --> 32:57.927
All right.

32:57.995 --> 33:00.696
Do you have any artificial
metal implants?

33:00.765 --> 33:01.764
Hip or knee
replacement perhaps?

33:01.832 --> 33:02.932
No.

33:02.999 --> 33:04.733
All righty, I'm gonna
have to pat you down.

33:04.801 --> 33:06.569
I can do that in private
if you prefer.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.671
Just get it over with.

33:08.739 --> 33:10.973
Arms out, please.

33:19.148 --> 33:20.583
All righty, thank you.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.885
You have a safe
and pleasant flight, sir.

33:24.820 --> 33:27.088
We'd like to welcome all passengers

33:27.156 --> 33:28.424
to our private terminal.

33:28.491 --> 33:31.026
Please feel free to enjoy
the fresh baked cookies

33:31.094 --> 33:32.360
and beverages in our lounge.

34:10.735 --> 34:12.737
♪ ♪

34:39.435 --> 34:41.101
Maeko!

34:59.784 --> 35:02.586
I'm in.

35:24.976 --> 35:26.910
Eric, I still need
those schematics.

35:26.978 --> 35:28.478
All right, I'm sending them
to your phone.

35:28.546 --> 35:30.213
You don't have it
in flight mode, do you?

35:30.280 --> 35:32.648
That was a joke.

35:32.716 --> 35:34.416
That is debatable.

35:57.308 --> 35:59.710
Maeko.

36:06.984 --> 36:08.318
Maeko.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.800
Maeko.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.714
What am I, a contortionist?

36:40.782 --> 36:42.048
Don't answer that.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.850
Deeks, that goes
especially for you.

36:55.562 --> 36:57.764
Ready.

36:57.832 --> 36:58.999
Yeah.

37:05.039 --> 37:06.039
Thanks.

37:10.910 --> 37:12.345
Kensi's clear, Deeks,

37:12.412 --> 37:14.414
but we still need
a little time.

37:17.483 --> 37:19.885
I'm on it.

37:23.590 --> 37:25.191
<i>Sierra Tango, be advised.</i>

37:25.259 --> 37:26.793
You have ground crew
in the area.

37:26.861 --> 37:29.196
We have them in sight,
Sierra Tango.

37:30.364 --> 37:32.298
Oh, gee.

37:32.367 --> 37:36.369
Got a baggage spill
on runway five.

38:02.093 --> 38:04.161
Sierra Tango,
please hold position.

38:04.230 --> 38:05.831
You are clear to taxi on Charlie

38:05.898 --> 38:07.700
after ramp personnel
has clearance.

38:07.766 --> 38:09.768
Will hold, Sierra Tango.

38:13.105 --> 38:15.641
Good to go, Deeks.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.519
Maeko!

38:30.190 --> 38:31.523
Maeko!

39:23.913 --> 39:25.413
Maeko?

39:29.653 --> 39:32.121
Connor!

39:38.128 --> 39:40.126
How did your father
agree to let you go?

39:40.195 --> 39:41.651
He didn't.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.651
It's a long story
and I'm sure

39:43.720 --> 39:44.972
she'll tell you
all about it.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.514
With Maeko's testimony
and our case report,

39:47.583 --> 39:49.988
you should get upgraded
to an honorable discharge.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.479
Really?

39:51.548 --> 39:53.174
You'll have to jump
through some hoops

39:53.242 --> 39:55.105
with the Board for
Correction of Naval Records,

39:55.174 --> 39:57.408
but we'll back you up.

39:57.478 --> 40:01.307
I... We don't know
how to thank you.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.983
Stay out of trouble, don't
miss your court hearings.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.699
Good luck.

40:10.084 --> 40:11.929
They're so sweet.

40:11.996 --> 40:14.433
All right, Sleepless in Seattle,
you want to grab a beer?

40:14.501 --> 40:16.115
If you ask me nicely.

40:16.182 --> 40:17.631
You know what, forget about it.

40:17.699 --> 40:18.950
Why?

40:19.016 --> 40:20.367
I know where
this is headed.

40:20.434 --> 40:22.279
Every time you see something
like these two,

40:22.346 --> 40:24.651
you get all Eat, Pray,
Lovesick on me.

40:24.718 --> 40:26.366
You don't like
happy endings?

40:26.432 --> 40:27.982
I'm sorry, what?

40:28.047 --> 40:29.661
Why do you have
to go there?

40:29.728 --> 40:30.816
Oh, my gosh.

40:30.882 --> 40:33.534
I just want to have
some beers with my partner.

40:33.602 --> 40:34.695
I can do that.

40:34.762 --> 40:35.855
Yeah? Can you?

40:35.922 --> 40:39.469
Partners-- just have
some burgers, watch the game.

40:39.536 --> 40:41.590
Of course.

40:41.658 --> 40:43.646
I'm just one of the guys.

40:43.713 --> 40:46.133
Well, if that's the case, maybe
we should hit up a strip club.

40:46.199 --> 40:47.990
- Don't be an idiot.
- All right.

40:48.056 --> 40:49.580
Fair enough.

40:50.941 --> 40:52.067
- Want me to drive?
- No.

40:52.134 --> 40:53.891
All right.

40:59.759 --> 41:02.576
All went down
as planned.

41:02.644 --> 41:04.002
Oh.

41:04.068 --> 41:06.887
So glad to hear that,
Mr. Callen.

41:06.954 --> 41:08.191
Where's Sam?

41:08.260 --> 41:11.171
He went home to spend some time
with his family.

41:11.239 --> 41:14.285
Ah. That's good.

41:14.353 --> 41:15.927
He needs that.

41:15.994 --> 41:18.504
Especially now.

41:29.217 --> 41:30.990
What about you?

41:31.058 --> 41:33.702
You ever regret not
settling down, having a family?

41:33.770 --> 41:37.719
Well, I think
about it sometimes.

41:37.786 --> 41:40.866
Maybe when I'm older.

41:42.440 --> 41:43.712
And you?

41:43.780 --> 41:47.796
I think I'll keep looking
for my own first.

41:50.142 --> 41:51.614
Good night, Hetty.

41:51.681 --> 41:53.119
Good night, Mr. Callen.

41:53.188 --> 41:56.736
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

41:57.978 --> 41:59.986
<i>Good night, Walter.</i>
