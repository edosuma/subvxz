<i>NARRATOR: Previously,</i>
<i>on The Long Road Home.</i>

00:03.087 --> 00:04.253
GARY: We take two convoys in.

00:04.355 --> 00:06.321
Rescue 1 will make contact
with the platoon and extract.

00:06.424 --> 00:08.524
I'll take Rescue 2, I'll
be 15 minutes behind you.

00:08.626 --> 00:10.292
ALFONSO: Come on,
we're Oscar Mike.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.761
MILTENBERGER: I'll, uh, ride
in the back with the men.

00:13.364 --> 00:14.997
-Oh, don't mess
around, get in.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.499
-No, I'm good.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.234
Thanks, Miranda.

00:20.805 --> 00:21.704
LEANN: Apparently, there's
some chatter about an attack
going on in Sadr City.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.007
He'll be fine, they
will all be fine.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.709
LUPITA: How can you know?

00:26.811 --> 00:29.445
SHANE: Lancer 6, we spent
about a third of our combat
load on the initial ambush.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.147
If the enemy comes back,
we will not be able to
hold them off for long.

00:33.150 --> 00:34.950
TROY: Lancer 2, Comanche 6,
we're about to have contact.

00:44.428 --> 00:45.928
-Taylor.

00:54.739 --> 00:59.808
-I have a rendezvous
with Death at some
disputed barricade.

01:01.912 --> 01:07.349
When spring comes
back with rustling shade and
apple-blossoms fill the air,

01:09.854 --> 01:12.988
I have a rendezvous
with Death.

01:13.524 --> 01:18.026
When spring brings back
blue days and fair.

01:19.029 --> 01:20.729
-Custom-molded?

01:20.831 --> 01:22.731
Uh, you're making
that up, Corporal.

01:23.701 --> 01:28.103
-Well, almost all parts in
Soviet-made anti-aircraft
guns until the '70's.

01:28.773 --> 01:32.374
And get this: nothing was
standard so each of these
fit only the gun for which

01:32.643 --> 01:35.444
it was made.

01:35.546 --> 01:37.846
The factories only made
a set number of parts.

01:37.948 --> 01:39.782
You ran out, you ran out.

01:39.884 --> 01:42.785
Now this stuff is just rustin'
junk all over Eastern Europe.

01:42.887 --> 01:45.554
-The Russians supposed
to be telling us that?

01:45.656 --> 01:49.057
-Well, I guess no more than
we're supposed to be out
there drinking with them.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.126
-Uh, so wait.

01:51.228 --> 01:53.195
What would have happened if
the Russians would have run
out of parts during

01:53.297 --> 01:55.764
the actual war?

01:55.866 --> 01:57.699
-I guess they would
have surrendered.

01:57.802 --> 02:00.869
-Corporal, we should have
known about this years ago.

02:02.406 --> 02:04.306
(sighs).

02:04.608 --> 02:07.709
Man, it is peaceful here.

02:08.245 --> 02:11.446
Man, it's hard to believe
anybody would wanna kill
people when it's so peaceful.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.882
-Uh well, they did, no
one even knows how many.

02:15.319 --> 02:18.754
Now the survivors can't
stop murdering the perps.

02:19.256 --> 02:21.156
-I say let the people
get their payback.

02:21.258 --> 02:22.558
I mean, why not?

02:22.660 --> 02:23.792
-Because when does that end?

02:23.894 --> 02:25.294
When everyone here's dead?

02:25.396 --> 02:27.162
-It sure saves us a trip.

02:27.264 --> 02:31.033
-Oh, come on, man, you're
too young to be that cynical.

02:31.135 --> 02:33.468
You see that flag
on your shoulder?

02:33.571 --> 02:36.205
You know what that means
to the people here?

02:36.307 --> 02:39.908
It means for the first
time in a long time,
they can walk outside

02:40.010 --> 02:43.011
and see a soldier
not be afraid.

02:44.448 --> 02:47.349
That their kids can
sleep safely at night.

02:47.451 --> 02:50.485
That for the first
time since the war, the
world makes sense again.

02:51.455 --> 02:53.055
There's a future.

02:53.157 --> 02:54.690
-You're a true
believer, Corporal.

02:54.792 --> 02:55.691
-Corporal!

02:55.793 --> 02:57.125
Bogey approaching.

02:57.228 --> 02:58.794
-Oh, you know the drill,
just tell them to turn
around, there's no

02:58.896 --> 03:00.262
vehicles through here.

03:00.364 --> 03:02.297
-It's a woman.

03:11.308 --> 03:14.209
-Ma'am , this road's closed.

03:14.311 --> 03:16.211
Ma'am, you speak English?

03:16.313 --> 03:18.547
There's no passage
through here.

03:18.649 --> 03:21.316
It's dangerous, you
got to turn back.

03:26.323 --> 03:28.156
Get an interpreter
on the horn.

03:28.259 --> 03:29.458
Everyone relax.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.293
-Corporal.

03:34.999 --> 03:38.667
-Ma'am, you need
help are you hurt?

03:41.639 --> 03:43.405
Ma'am, what's wrong?

03:43.507 --> 03:45.607
-What's she carrying?

03:46.911 --> 03:49.878
(thunder)

03:49.980 --> 03:53.415
(inaudible mumbling).

03:58.856 --> 04:01.089
BELINDA: Robert,
you were dreaming.

04:04.261 --> 04:08.931
-Yeah, it's all
right, it's all right.

04:18.709 --> 04:22.044
-Was it the same
dream, was it her?

04:22.346 --> 04:25.614
-Go back to sleep
Bel, I'm fine.

04:35.559 --> 04:41.997
¶ ¶

04:52.643 --> 04:56.144
-God knows 'twere
better to be deep.

04:56.246 --> 05:03.051
Pillowed in silk and scented
down, where love throbs
out in blissful sleep.

05:11.662 --> 05:16.732
But I've a rendezvous
with Death at midnight
in some flaming town.

05:19.103 --> 05:23.739
When Spring trips
north again this year.

05:33.417 --> 05:39.354
¶ ¶

05:39.757 --> 05:42.958
-Please, just talk to me.

05:44.962 --> 05:46.928
-Nothing left to
say, all right?

05:47.297 --> 05:49.965
I've said everything, okay?

05:52.302 --> 05:56.338
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, here.

05:58.976 --> 06:01.043
-I don't need that.
-Come on, I need to know...
-Don't need that.

06:01.145 --> 06:04.946
-I need to know
you're safe, please.

06:08.485 --> 06:12.721
I don't wanna fight, okay?

06:12.956 --> 06:15.590
I wanna remember
your face like this.

06:18.495 --> 06:21.730
-It's not fair.

06:21.832 --> 06:24.332
All the plans we made.

06:25.436 --> 06:30.305
I love you, Robert, but
this, I can't, I can't.

06:30.741 --> 06:33.775
-Yes, you can.

06:38.515 --> 06:44.019
I love you, Belinda forever.

06:54.865 --> 06:57.799
(gunfire and explosions)

07:04.708 --> 07:06.508
-That our convoy or
Rescue 1 in contact?

07:07.377 --> 07:09.811
-Probably both, just
cover your sector.

07:15.886 --> 07:19.688
(distant gunfire)

07:20.891 --> 07:25.360
-Fire's heavy, get ready.
-I got a bad feeling, man.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.929
ISRAEL: Just stay close.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.365
You'll be all right, man.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.303
RAFAEL: Here we go, my
mans, right into the shit.

07:38.775 --> 07:41.510
-We need to move him.

07:41.979 --> 07:44.779
Hiller, get him
off that seat so we can get
this vehicle going or the

07:44.882 --> 07:46.481
whole convoy's
gonna get trapped.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.517
-Yes, sir.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.990
-All Warrior Elements,
this is Lancer 6:

07:55.092 --> 07:57.826
abort your approach,
Route Copper is blocked.

07:57.928 --> 07:59.561
I repeat, abort your approach.

08:01.265 --> 08:04.232
(gunfire)

08:05.169 --> 08:06.401
REGINALD: The hell?

08:06.503 --> 08:09.137
All Warrior Blues, Blue
5, why are we stopping?

08:09.406 --> 08:10.739
We're in a kill zone, over.

08:10.841 --> 08:13.074
AHMED: Sergeant, there's
a vehicle down at
the head of the convoy.

08:13.677 --> 08:15.443
-Get us around.
-Yes, sir.

08:20.284 --> 08:22.884
(gunfire)

08:24.521 --> 08:26.221
(painful grunt)

08:32.596 --> 08:33.695
-How you doin', Spicer?

08:33.797 --> 08:34.629
CLAY: Me?

08:34.731 --> 08:35.697
You're the one
that's all messed up.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.566
SETH: We can't hold them
off much longer, sir.

08:37.668 --> 08:42.237
(gunfire)

08:54.818 --> 08:56.084
(explosion)

09:03.493 --> 09:05.026
-Let's go, let's go,
let's move.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.095
-Let's go, what the...!

09:12.502 --> 09:14.803
-There you go, come on Gumby.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.774
-Sir, you're wounded.

09:19.876 --> 09:22.611
-It's fine, Lieutenant,
Spicer patched me up.

09:27.184 --> 09:29.251
All Comanche Whites,
Comanche Six:

09:29.353 --> 09:33.021
all elements regroup
on Route Aeros for casualty
assessment and evac, over!

¶ ¶

09:50.874 --> 09:52.107
-Stop truck.

09:52.209 --> 09:54.776
Abort, back up, back up!

10:09.559 --> 10:11.526
-Holy shit.

10:13.397 --> 10:16.698
-That's right,
I'm a G, you can't touch me.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.241
-I'm good, I'm good.

10:35.585 --> 10:38.286
(gunfire)

10:48.265 --> 10:50.699
-Warrior Blue 1,
Lancer 6, do you copy?

10:50.934 --> 10:53.134
We are trapped in a mobile.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.471
Blue 1, do you copy?

10:56.573 --> 10:57.772
-Lancer 6, we're trying.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.008
The convoy is
blocking us, over.

11:00.944 --> 11:02.577
-It's no use Colonel.

11:05.816 --> 11:08.783
-Red 1, Rescue 1 has aborted
for casualty collection, over.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.120
-Comanche 6, how
bad is it, over?

11:12.422 --> 11:14.656
-Everybody will live,
don't worry about us, over.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.460
-And Colonel Volesky,
Rescue 2, over?

11:19.296 --> 11:21.329
-Still in heavy contact,
taking casualties.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.132
That's the fire
you're hearing, over.

11:27.571 --> 11:28.937
They may still get through.

11:29.039 --> 11:32.207
If not, I just need
you to hold down the
fort a little longer.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.776
Can you do that for me, over.

11:34.878 --> 11:36.444
-Roger that, over.

11:37.647 --> 11:39.314
-Comanche 6 out.

11:43.487 --> 11:45.820
(gunfire)

11:48.158 --> 11:50.458

13:00.530 --> 13:02.130
-Bad news, homie.

13:02.232 --> 13:05.233
You either pissed your
pants or your canteen
didn't make it.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.739
-I told you we'd be fine.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.642
-I think you just saved
our lives, Sergeant.

13:14.744 --> 13:17.979
-We ain't out of nothing yet.

13:20.584 --> 13:22.050
Let's move.

13:35.265 --> 13:38.500

Lancer 6, follow us out.

Any vehicles still
battle-able and without
urgent casualties,

regroup with
Comanche 6 on Route Aeros.

didn't we, Sergeant?

14:20.277 --> 14:23.878

14:26.283 --> 14:28.516
-You ain't afraid, right?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.985
-Hell, no, I ain't afraid.

14:32.589 --> 14:36.257
-Well, I ain't afraid
either, Sergeant.

al-Sadr's real target.

We were bait.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.741
Like when assholes set
off a little bomb and wait
for the first responders

15:26.843 --> 15:29.277
to detonate the real one.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.515
They ambushed us to draw out
the rescues and mow them down.

15:40.390 --> 15:44.125
Now they're going to
come for us for real.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.630
We're just rats in their maze.

way back, Sergeant.

get here quick.

dark within the hour.

night vision gear.

It's an almost full
moon tonight, right?

16:00.210 --> 16:02.977
That will provide
us some light.

Hey, we just got to

Four soldiers dead.

No, how can be
there nothing on?

they said Sadr City?

18:14.853 --> 18:17.721
-Radiator tank's cracked.

18:17.823 --> 18:20.757
I can seal it but we're
going to have to refill
it, or we're not going far.

18:23.028 --> 18:24.628
ALFONSO: Of course we
don't have a radio.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.062
So now what, we walk home?

18:26.165 --> 18:27.364
-We're safest here now.

18:27.466 --> 18:30.233
So you can fix it, you just
need a coolant, is that right?

18:30.335 --> 18:31.435
-Water would do.

18:31.537 --> 18:33.570
-Water, okay, hey,
gather up your canteens.

18:33.672 --> 18:35.472
Bring them over.

18:41.380 --> 18:44.080
-No, that ain't enough.

18:44.716 --> 18:46.616
THOMAS: All right, there's got
to be water somewhere, right?

18:46.718 --> 18:48.752
One of these buildings
has to have it.

18:48.854 --> 18:52.556
-Hardly anyone here
has running water,
but you got a point.

18:53.892 --> 18:55.225
-What are you thinking?

18:55.327 --> 18:57.761
-There's got to
be a public spigot or
something in the area.

18:57.863 --> 18:59.763
You guys wait with
the truck, all right?

18:59.865 --> 19:01.398
-No, you can't go out alone.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.766
-It's no use
risking more lives.

19:02.868 --> 19:03.967
-No, I volunteer, Sergeant.

19:04.069 --> 19:05.602
You need someone
to watch your six.

19:05.704 --> 19:07.604
RAFAEL: Yeah, I'm coming too.

19:07.706 --> 19:10.307
We can't fix the truck, we're
just sitting ducks out here.

19:10.409 --> 19:12.576
-Yeah, all right.

19:13.245 --> 19:15.045
Grab the canteens, let's go.

19:17.416 --> 19:18.882
-We need help right now.

19:28.494 --> 19:33.663
(painful screams)

19:42.341 --> 19:44.341
-Get him out, let's go.

19:44.943 --> 19:45.809
-You should sit down.

19:45.911 --> 19:47.110
I'll check your
injuries in a moment.

19:47.212 --> 19:48.078
GARY: It's not my blood.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.412
What can I do to
help, Captain?

19:49.515 --> 19:51.381
-Please hold this sir.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.682
Are you ready, Specialist?

19:52.784 --> 19:54.985
-Is it bad?
-Hey, you're going to be okay.

19:55.087 --> 19:56.319
Well, get him sedated.

19:56.421 --> 19:58.388
We'll suture right here.

20:01.627 --> 20:02.592
-Sergeant Butler.

20:02.694 --> 20:04.394
-We got this, sir.

20:04.696 --> 20:05.529
REGINALD: Sir?

20:05.631 --> 20:06.930
-I'm sorry about Cason.

20:07.032 --> 20:08.698
I know you two were close.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.699
-Thank you, sir.

20:09.801 --> 20:11.801
-Did all the badly
injured make it back?

20:11.904 --> 20:13.336
-We're missing a truck, sir.

20:13.438 --> 20:15.038
Miltenberger's.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.706
-What happened?
-No one knows.

20:16.808 --> 20:18.041
He was the last vehicle.

20:18.143 --> 20:19.209
Must have gotten stranded.

20:19.311 --> 20:20.343
-We can't raise him?

20:20.445 --> 20:22.479
-He's got no radio.

20:23.582 --> 20:25.615
-Thank you, son.

20:29.555 --> 20:34.391
-Mom, we rode all the
way down to the pier and.

20:35.994 --> 20:38.728
-Mom, what's wrong?

20:39.565 --> 20:41.798
-Come sit down, both of you.

20:42.501 --> 20:44.067
-There was a news story.

20:44.169 --> 20:47.103
-Not about dad?
-Yes.
-No, we don't know.

20:48.907 --> 20:50.941
-What did it say?
-Shh, this must be it.

20:51.643 --> 20:53.543
<i>REPORTER (over radio):</i>
<i>Sadr City section of Baghdad.</i>

20:53.645 --> 20:56.513
<i>One Iraqi has reportedly</i>
<i>been killed and many wounded.</i>

20:56.949 --> 21:01.117
<i>Iraqis are said to be</i>
<i>fighting with rocket-propelled</i>
<i>grenades and AK-47 rifles.</i>

21:02.187 --> 21:04.654
<i>Two US Humvees have</i>
<i>been set on fire.</i>

21:04.923 --> 21:07.791
<i>Meantime, the cleric</i>
<i>whose supporters have</i>
<i>staged these protests,</i>

21:08.360 --> 21:12.596
<i>has issued a statement</i>
<i>calling on his followers to</i>
<i>end their demonstration but</i>

21:12.698 --> 21:15.532
<i>urging them to</i>
<i>"Terrorize the enemy."</i>

21:17.603 --> 21:19.436
-That's it?

21:19.838 --> 21:23.273
Mom, there was nothing
about Americans dying.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.709
-Dads all right, right?

21:28.680 --> 21:29.512
-Mama?

21:29.615 --> 21:33.450
-Your daddy is okay,
of course, he is.

21:33.685 --> 21:36.720
Gannon, Jacee, go set
the table for lunch;
you all must be hungry.

21:38.223 --> 21:42.692
-But grandma.
-No, go on now, go on.

21:47.366 --> 21:49.366
What is the matter with you?

21:49.468 --> 21:51.368
You are scaring them.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.803
-He tried to tell me but
I didn't believe him.

21:53.905 --> 21:55.972
-Tell you what?

21:56.074 --> 21:58.942
-Robert knew he
would die over there.

21:59.044 --> 22:02.012
He knew it.

22:17.896 --> 22:19.496
-Are you sure this
is the way Sergeant?

22:19.598 --> 22:21.831
-Just keep your eyes
on your sectors.

22:21.933 --> 22:25.068
-I swear its all that
guy knows how to say.

22:28.006 --> 22:33.743
So what made you sign
up for this, man?

22:35.113 --> 22:39.449
Felt like it was either
going to be this or jail.

22:40.786 --> 22:43.953
I'm seriously starting to
rethink that right about now.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.795
-What is it Sergeant?

23:15.721 --> 23:17.654
-Damn.

23:19.825 --> 23:23.927
-What now?

23:27.499 --> 23:31.067
-This is good, this
has got to be water.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.806
Okay, here we go,
hand me the canteen.

23:51.423 --> 23:54.124
CLAY: Sir, we got everyone
ready to go out, you ready?

23:54.359 --> 23:55.992
TROY: I'm not coming
back with you.

23:56.094 --> 23:59.162
-You got two gunshot
wounds, you've lost blood.

23:59.998 --> 24:02.365
-I have a plan I wanna try.

24:12.811 --> 24:14.310
(loud clang)

24:18.183 --> 24:22.085
-Martin, up across,
Young, you push forward.

24:32.063 --> 24:37.133
¶ ¶

24:46.912 --> 24:51.781
(chewing)

24:51.883 --> 24:54.584
Let's go.

24:59.491 --> 25:03.159
-And then we go all the
way around to route Silver,
and take that to Delta,

25:03.261 --> 25:04.828
and then attack south.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.997
We keep the Bradleys
in front and hopefully we'll
have the crusader tanks back

25:08.099 --> 25:10.667
in the fight by the time
we reach the target area.

25:10.769 --> 25:12.168
What do you think, over?

25:12.604 --> 25:15.538
-Major Six, Brother Troy
that's a solid plan.

25:16.174 --> 25:18.842
But before you launch,
I need you to try
to find Miltenberger.

25:18.944 --> 25:22.445
He's got an almost full
platoon on an unarmored LMTV.

25:22.714 --> 25:25.748
We can't risk having
two units stranded in an
enemy-controlled city, over.

25:26.451 --> 25:30.453
-Roger that sir, over.
-Godspeed brother, six out.

25:41.633 --> 25:47.136
¶ ¶

25:47.973 --> 25:52.208
(inaudible chatter)

25:52.310 --> 25:55.311
(painful screams)

26:06.674 --> 26:09.608
ead, who are the wounded?

26:09.711 --> 26:11.177
They said at least 40.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.378
We want their names.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.015
LEANN: If everyone could
just, just please quiet down.

26:18.553 --> 26:22.154
I'm sorry, we don't have
any information and I have to
tell you that even if we did,

26:22.790 --> 26:27.026
I couldn't reveal names
until all of the next of
kin have been located.

26:30.231 --> 26:33.432
Understand that these rules
are in place for a reason.

26:33.534 --> 26:36.869
We all know information
spreads quickly, especially
wrong information.

26:38.406 --> 26:40.306
So, as hard as it
is right now...

26:40.408 --> 26:43.075
-We want the names
of the wounded.

26:45.079 --> 26:48.614
GINA: Everyone,
we are all anxious.

26:50.752 --> 26:53.419
I am anxious, and so is Leann.

26:55.389 --> 26:58.157
Our husbands are in
this too, and we don't know
anything about them either.

26:59.427 --> 27:02.394
I had Merrick right before
this deployment started.

27:06.100 --> 27:09.168
And Troy had just a few days
with him before he had to go.

27:09.270 --> 27:15.708
We all have things that
make this so hard, each
of us, different things.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.182
I promise, as soon as we're
able, we will contact you.

27:26.120 --> 27:30.089
So please, go home
so we can reach you and
hopefully, with good news.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.594
-Hey, hey don't spread
wrong information?

27:37.131 --> 27:39.765
You were the one who told us
we had nothing to worry about.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.368
-I know and I'm sorry.

27:42.470 --> 27:45.004
-You said we were family,
that you were here for us.

27:45.106 --> 27:46.505
-I am here for
you, we both are.

27:46.607 --> 27:49.308
-Then help us, tell us
something, anything.

27:49.410 --> 27:54.613
-I can't.
-You're just a liar.
-Come on, Lupita.

28:05.459 --> 28:08.060
-Come on.

28:12.466 --> 28:14.800
Everyone's just upset.

28:18.339 --> 28:19.705
-It's all right.

28:19.807 --> 28:23.742
If it helps
them to be angry with me,
if that takes away even just

28:23.845 --> 28:26.345
a little bit of her pain,
I'll gladly take it.

28:31.853 --> 28:35.020
ISRAEL: It's crazy,
but you know what I
keep thinking about?

28:36.324 --> 28:38.490
-Hmm?

28:38.759 --> 28:43.796
-When I was 16, my dad
used to make me stay up
and wait for my sisters,

28:45.266 --> 28:47.967
and they go on dates.

28:50.204 --> 28:54.340
I was the only boy and
he had to work night, so
that's how it went, man.

28:57.378 --> 28:59.879
I used to scare the shit out
of them when they got home.

29:00.715 --> 29:03.115
Like, God, they used
to get so mad at me.

29:08.556 --> 29:10.456
You know what else I've
been thinking about?

29:10.558 --> 29:13.959
It's what we should do when
we get out of here, man.

29:14.061 --> 29:15.094
-Yeah?

29:15.196 --> 29:18.564
-Yeah, I always wanted
to open up a guitar shop.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.468
-Guitar shop?
-Yeah.
-You even play?

29:22.737 --> 29:24.470
-I'll learn shit.

29:24.572 --> 29:25.871
Why not, man?

29:25.973 --> 29:28.641
We'll just hang out and
play some awesome tunes.

29:28.743 --> 29:32.011
We could get my dad involved,
you know, like make it a
whole little family business.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.580
-Yeah.

29:35.583 --> 29:41.587
-Yeah, yeah, I
mean that, I never had a
brother before you, so...

29:47.695 --> 29:48.661
-Movement.

29:48.763 --> 29:50.996
RAFAEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't shoot us, dogs.

29:51.098 --> 29:53.399
We got cold drinks.

29:54.902 --> 29:56.335
MILTENBERGER: How's
the coolant tank?

29:56.437 --> 29:58.671
DRIVER: It should hold.

30:03.077 --> 30:05.678
MIRANDA: Back on
Copper, when you ordered
us to stop and back up,

30:05.780 --> 30:06.979
how did you spot those guys?

30:07.081 --> 30:09.315
I couldn't see shit.

30:09.417 --> 30:11.850
-Just lucky, I guess.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.857
-I guess we'll know soon.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.126
-Yeah.

30:24.799 --> 30:27.366
-That book won't stop
no bullets, you know.

30:27.468 --> 30:29.301
-Yeah, I know.

30:30.638 --> 30:33.372
-Let me guess, a Bible?

30:34.642 --> 30:36.608
-Nah, just poems.
-Porn?

30:36.711 --> 30:38.177
You got...

30:38.279 --> 30:41.880
-Poems, like poetry.
-Pornetry?
-Poetry.

30:41.983 --> 30:44.016
-Poetry.

30:44.118 --> 30:46.051
Well, why would anybody
carry poetry around, bro?

30:46.153 --> 30:47.720
It'd be better if it
was some ass, for real.

30:47.822 --> 30:50.889
-Hey look, it's Alan Seeger.

30:51.158 --> 30:54.893
The, the American
poet, joined the French
Foreign Legion to, uh,

30:54.996 --> 30:57.763
fight the Germans
in World War I.

30:58.466 --> 31:01.266
-All right, I dig that.

31:03.504 --> 31:05.904
Go ahead, let me hear
the one you like.

31:07.675 --> 31:09.942
Go ahead, bro.

31:11.645 --> 31:13.679
-All right, uh...

31:16.517 --> 31:20.986
"I have a rendezvous with death
and some disputed barricade,

31:22.023 --> 31:25.624
when spring comes
back with rustling shade and
apple-blossoms fill the air.

31:27.828 --> 31:32.464
I have a rendezvous with
death, when spring brings
back blue days and fair."

31:37.505 --> 31:39.972
-That's the one you like?

31:40.207 --> 31:42.474
Okay, you're twisted
Young, officially.

31:43.344 --> 31:46.378
-It's dark, I know it's got
a note of hope in it, though.

31:50.951 --> 31:54.153
-Did Seeger come
back from war?

32:09.904 --> 32:13.505
ERIC: Where the hell are they,
what are they waiting for?

32:15.209 --> 32:17.176
SHANE: I do not know.

32:21.549 --> 32:24.550
You know, I keep seeing
Chen's face in my head.

32:25.386 --> 32:30.422
Not like, not like
in the courtyard but,
you know, on the,

32:31.025 --> 32:33.826
on the plane on
the way over here.

32:35.596 --> 32:38.564
Just, he's was just so peaceful.

32:40.768 --> 32:45.504
I mean, I don't know how,
but, I don't know.

32:45.906 --> 32:51.343
I guess I just, um, I
guess I hope that's how
he is now, you know.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.250
-Or singing.

32:58.352 --> 33:01.453
The man loved to sing.

33:05.860 --> 33:09.461
I keep trying to remember
the last thing that he
and I said to each other.

33:11.132 --> 33:15.267
It was right before
we rolled out and I walked
past your Humvee and he was

33:15.369 --> 33:17.903
making fun of Fisk's shave job.

33:18.806 --> 33:21.807
And I said something.

33:23.110 --> 33:25.744
I can't remember.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.916
What the hell was it,
why can't I remember?

33:35.222 --> 33:38.190
(painful grunt)

33:42.897 --> 33:44.396
-You all right, Jackson?

33:44.498 --> 33:47.633
-Yeah, I just got
to pee real bad.

33:48.169 --> 33:50.969
-Jesus, just go, I'll
watch your sector.

33:59.914 --> 34:02.047
-They got me in
the fucking face.

34:03.851 --> 34:05.417
SHANE: Anybody see
where it's coming from?

34:05.519 --> 34:07.653
-Fuck.

34:08.656 --> 34:09.922
-Okay, I'm pressing now.

34:10.024 --> 34:12.357
I'm pressing now.

34:18.999 --> 34:21.333
-Oh, shit.

34:29.376 --> 34:31.677
¶ ¶

34:41.722 --> 34:42.754
MINA: Hey, Shaggy?

34:43.057 --> 34:43.822
-Um, yeah?

34:43.924 --> 34:44.990
-Who's driving?

34:45.092 --> 34:46.758
-Rello.

34:47.428 --> 34:49.261
-Mommy, let's do that again.

34:49.363 --> 34:51.997
-Yeah, that was fun, huh and
what else are we going to do?

34:52.766 --> 34:53.665
-Ice cream.

34:53.767 --> 34:55.501
-And somebody's gonna
write Daddy, right?

34:55.603 --> 34:56.435
Amber Aguero.

34:56.537 --> 34:57.836
<i>ROY (over phone):</i>
<i>Amber, it's Roy.</i>

34:57.938 --> 34:59.738
-Hi, it's grandpa ranger Roy.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.306
Go, go, go, wash your hands.

35:01.408 --> 35:02.808
Hey Roy, what's up?

35:02.910 --> 35:05.143
<i>ROY (over phone):</i>
<i>No one's contacted you?</i>

35:05.246 --> 35:06.345
-No.

35:06.447 --> 35:08.847
<i>ROY (over phone):</i>
<i>There's been an attack in Iraq.</i>

35:08.949 --> 35:10.482
<i>You sure no one's</i>
<i>tried to call you?</i>

35:10.584 --> 35:13.352
-Um, no, no,
I don't think so.

35:13.454 --> 35:15.521
<i>ROY (over phone): Well,</i>
<i>maybe we shouldn't worry yet.</i>

35:15.623 --> 35:17.589
-Roy, what's happening?

35:17.691 --> 35:20.259
<i>ROY (over phone): Platoon</i>
<i>was ambushed in Sadr City.</i>

35:20.361 --> 35:22.861
<i>Four dead, at least</i>
<i>forty wounded.</i>

35:22.963 --> 35:25.430
<i>Battle still going on.</i>

35:25.533 --> 35:26.765
<i>No one's called you, though.</i>

35:26.867 --> 35:28.534
<i>That's good, it's</i>
<i>probably not his unit.</i>

35:28.636 --> 35:31.503
-No, it is, it's his unit.
it's his platoon.

35:31.605 --> 35:34.139
<i>ROY (over phone):</i>
<i>How do you know that?</i>

35:34.241 --> 35:37.075
-I just feel it, it's him.

35:42.216 --> 35:45.384
Roy, I have to call you back.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.754
Honey, hey.

35:49.890 --> 35:53.559
-Daddy's gonna die
and it's all my fault.

35:53.661 --> 35:55.193
Sorry.

35:55.296 --> 35:59.631
-No, sweetie.
-Daddy's been hurt?
-No, no.

36:01.835 --> 36:06.104
Something may have happened
with Daddy's unit but Daddy
is such a good soldier.

36:07.841 --> 36:10.309
He knows how to take
care of himself, yeah?

36:11.011 --> 36:12.711
So we don't have to worry.

36:12.813 --> 36:16.281
Daddy's gonna call
us really soon, okay?

36:22.656 --> 36:25.023
It's gonna be okay.

36:25.859 --> 36:26.925
SHANE: Conserve your shots.

36:27.027 --> 36:29.328
Fire only at
confirmed targets.

36:31.031 --> 36:31.763
Talk to me, doc.

36:31.865 --> 36:32.598
How is he?

36:32.700 --> 36:34.433
-They shot me in
the fucking mouth.

36:34.535 --> 36:35.601
-Hey, no, they didn't, mate.

36:35.703 --> 36:37.402
You just got nicked in the
lip by a fragment, okay?

36:37.504 --> 36:39.271
It bleeds but you're
gonna be fine, all right?

36:39.373 --> 36:40.505
Your hand's gonna
be fine, too.

36:40.608 --> 36:41.673
Work with me.

36:41.775 --> 36:43.909
-Bourquin.
-Yeah?
-How's Hayhurst?

36:44.011 --> 36:45.444
-I got an exit wound.

36:45.546 --> 36:46.445
Do you feel your
arm, Sergeant?

36:46.547 --> 36:48.847
-Yeah, it's okay.

36:50.050 --> 36:51.116
-Ah, shit.

36:51.218 --> 36:52.217
-What?

36:52.319 --> 36:54.886
-Sir, I think the bullet
dislocated his shoulder.

36:56.890 --> 36:58.290
-Take him downstairs.

36:58.392 --> 37:00.826
-No, no, I can, I can
use my offhand to fire.

37:01.061 --> 37:01.960
-You sure, man?

37:02.062 --> 37:04.196
-Yes, yes.

37:05.733 --> 37:08.900
-Sergeant, you okay?

37:12.539 --> 37:14.873
-I can't breathe.

37:15.409 --> 37:17.743
-Doc, you sure he
wasn't hit elsewhere?

37:18.012 --> 37:19.478
-I can't, I can't,
I can't breathe.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.146
-Doc, you're sure?
-I'm sure.
-Are you sure?

37:21.248 --> 37:22.514
-I'm gonna check on Hayhurst.

37:22.616 --> 37:23.649
I'm sure.

37:23.751 --> 37:24.883
-I can't breathe.

37:24.985 --> 37:27.019
-Okay, Sergeant
Jackson, listen to me.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.320
Listen to the
sound of my voice.

37:28.422 --> 37:30.722
You are having a panic
attack, you understand?

37:30.824 --> 37:31.790
You are fine, okay?

37:31.892 --> 37:33.291
I need you to breathe for me.

37:33.394 --> 37:34.993
Slow, deep breaths.

37:35.095 --> 37:37.162
Okay, control it,
that's all you need.

37:37.264 --> 37:38.830
Just slow and deep but one.

37:38.932 --> 37:39.998
Give me one, one in.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.000
Come on, in, in.

37:42.102 --> 37:45.437
Slow, there you
go, there you go.

37:45.939 --> 37:49.274
Give me one more,
there you go, see?

37:49.543 --> 37:52.411
-I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't.

37:57.785 --> 37:59.851
-Listen to me, that's
not here right now, okay?

37:59.953 --> 38:01.219
Right now, it's
just me and you.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.122
I need you to
listen to me, okay?

38:08.796 --> 38:10.529
Jackson, I need you to
breathe for me, okay?

38:10.631 --> 38:12.130
Just breathe.

38:12.433 --> 38:13.532
Just breathe.

38:13.634 --> 38:16.168
There you go,
all right, see that?

38:16.270 --> 38:18.904
Look at that, better?

38:20.307 --> 38:21.540
-I need to be relieved.

38:21.642 --> 38:24.009
-I cannot do that,
Sergeant, I cannot do that.

38:24.111 --> 38:27.546
Right now, I need every
man and every bullet on
this roof, you understand?

38:31.719 --> 38:33.351
All right look, I get it.

38:33.454 --> 38:35.053
It is hard, all right?

38:35.155 --> 38:36.555
And it is fucking scary.

38:36.657 --> 38:39.558
And when you get back
to base, you could cry,
you can break down,

38:39.660 --> 38:42.561
you can ask to be reassigned,
whatever you need, okay?

38:42.796 --> 38:43.628
Look at me.

38:43.731 --> 38:45.163
Listen to me, okay?

38:45.265 --> 38:48.200
But right now, on this
roof, my responsibility
is for the safety of all

38:48.302 --> 38:49.735
of these men, okay?

38:49.837 --> 38:51.236
Every one.

38:51.338 --> 38:53.071
And I need you here with me.

38:53.173 --> 38:54.139
You understand?

38:54.241 --> 38:56.374
I need you, you can do this.

38:56.477 --> 39:00.278
-Please, sir, I,
I can't, I can't.

39:10.023 --> 39:11.590
-Switch with Perry,
send him up here.

39:11.692 --> 39:12.891
Come on, go.

39:12.993 --> 39:15.427
You go, you watch the family.

39:28.375 --> 39:29.441
-Jesus, Sergeant.

39:29.543 --> 39:30.842
You all right?

39:30.944 --> 39:33.779
-LT wants us to trade places.

39:36.717 --> 39:38.116
-Sergeant, are you.

39:38.218 --> 39:43.488
-Sit down, sit down, sit down,
you all stay right there.

SETH: Sir, I don't wanna
sound pessimistic but how
are we supposed to rescue two

40:01.909 --> 40:04.042
platoons with just this?

40:15.589 --> 40:17.823

Listen, hey, are you okay?

40:42.950 --> 40:45.617

40:50.290 --> 40:52.424
Sir, can you hear me?

40:58.866 --> 41:00.866
-Why on Earth would
Robert think he was gonna die?

41:02.469 --> 41:04.603
-He had a premonition.

41:04.705 --> 41:07.439
He dreamed it.

41:08.108 --> 41:10.942
It was something that
had happened in Kosovo.

41:15.148 --> 41:18.116
A woman had come
to his checkpoint.

41:18.552 --> 41:24.222
Her baby had been taken
during the war and found in
a mass grave outside of town.

41:25.626 --> 41:30.629
She wandered all over
the area carrying the
body, beside herself.

41:32.666 --> 41:35.400
MILTENBERGER:
Ma'am, let me help you.

41:36.837 --> 41:39.571
Ma'am, you can't
go over there.

41:39.673 --> 41:40.906
Ma'am, stop walking.

41:41.008 --> 41:42.140
Don't take another step.

41:42.242 --> 41:43.742
Ma'am, ma'am, stop.

-That's what I told him,
but Robert was sure.

42:55.582 --> 43:00.685
Villagers in Kosovo had
told him that a gathering of
ravens was an omen of death.

43:03.390 --> 43:06.691
He thought that would be
his sign in Iraq, too.

43:07.594 --> 43:12.897
