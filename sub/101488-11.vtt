WEBVTT

00:20.437 --> 00:24.065
"To my special valentine,
you are my everything.

00:24.149 --> 00:27.068
I sleep only so I can dream of you."

00:27.152 --> 00:28.903
-Aw, Bob.
-Mm-hmm.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.613
Didn't Gene make me a nice valentine?

00:30.697 --> 00:33.658
It's very romantic for a child?

00:33.742 --> 00:36.453
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean, Dad, did you even make Mom

00:36.536 --> 00:38.204
an embarrassingly mushy valentine?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.290
-Like your son did?
-Hey, there's a plan in place.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.791
Yeah. We're writing out the ten things

00:41.875 --> 00:43.585
we love most about each other.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.545
And then we're gonna share 'em
over a bottle of wine.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.005
It's like love homework.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.757
Oh, that's kind of nice.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.426
And hard?
I mean, ten turns out to be a lot.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.178
That's what God said
about the commandments.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.180
Well, we tried to finish them last night,

00:55.263 --> 00:57.432
but we were making dinner
and then we were cleaning up dinner

00:57.515 --> 00:59.017
and then we were feeling too gassy,

00:59.100 --> 01:00.852
then we fell asleep in front of the TV

01:00.935 --> 01:03.104
and I didn't wake up
until a moth flew in my mouth.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.732
And I didn't wake up until you screamed.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.068
After all these years,
you two still sizzle.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.779
So we just need to find a quiet
minute and crap 'em out.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.864
Lovingly. How about you, Tina?

01:12.947 --> 01:15.408
You excited about
Tammy's Valentine's Day thingy?

01:15.492 --> 01:17.869
It's an Anti-Valentine's Day
thingy, actually.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.996
-Okay.
-It's a party for kids who are tired

01:20.080 --> 01:22.290
of living up to society's
expectation of romance

01:22.374 --> 01:23.917
just because it's February 14.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.211
So things with Jimmy Jr. are...

01:26.294 --> 01:28.171
I don't know.
He's at an overnight wrestling meet

01:28.254 --> 01:30.006
this weekend, and before he left
I said, "So, any ideas

01:30.090 --> 01:31.633
about how to handle V-Day
while you're gone?"

01:31.716 --> 01:33.009
And he was like, "What's V-Day?"

01:33.093 --> 01:34.260
And I was like,
"That's my super cool abbreviation

01:34.344 --> 01:35.679
for Valentine's Day."

01:35.762 --> 01:37.555
But by then he had his
headphones on and was singing

01:37.639 --> 01:39.224
a Red Hot Chili Peppers song really loud.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.725
-Guy's a catch.
-So when I heard about

01:40.809 --> 01:42.727
Tammy's party, I was very interested.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.522
Hearts are farts, people,
and Cupid is stupid.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.733
Cupid's just a baby
who likes to watch people kiss.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.235
And I'm not saying any of this

01:50.318 --> 01:51.444
because I don't have a boyfriend.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.238
You so don't have a boyfriend, Tammy.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.115
Shut it.
So I'm inviting a group

01:55.198 --> 01:57.367
of single girls and guys
who want to get away

01:57.450 --> 01:59.160
from all the rom-dram for one night.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.246
Sign me up, 'cause that's me.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.289
Ooh, space is actually limited.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.001
Plus, Tina, come on,
you're a total Valentine head.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.585
Nope, nope, not this year I'm not.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.462
Hmm, I'd valentine that.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.089
Oh, uh, sorry.
Hearts are farts.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.590
So Tammy invited me.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.259
Or actually she invited
a bunch of your burgers

02:14.342 --> 02:15.677
and said I could come with.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.595
Oh.
A bunch sounds like a lot.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.888
Free advertising?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.598
-Thanks?
-You're welcome.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.226
Bob, Bob, what about how well Linda sings

02:23.309 --> 02:25.729
that jingle on the radio
about the accident lawyers?

02:25.812 --> 02:26.938
She nails it every time.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.857
I really can do this myself, Teddy.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.234
Well, you need ten
and I got a list you can use.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.819
-You have a list?
-Forget it.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.612
Linda, what about Bob's knuckle hair?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.614
Like, sometimes it catches
the light just so?

02:36.698 --> 02:38.199
And it makes you feel safe?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.701
(whispers):
I already got that one.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.369
Ugh, Jimmy's really going overboard

02:41.453 --> 02:43.705
with his Valentine's shtick
again this year.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.207
LINDA:
"Tie-the-Knot Garlic Knots Appetizers,

02:46.291 --> 02:48.710
$20."
What a friggin' rip-off.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.796
-I'm not <i>not</i> knots interested.
-Way to keep an open mind, Gene.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.673
Oh, crap.
Here comes Jimmy.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.718
Hey, Bob, I saw
you guys gawking at my place.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.303
If you were hoping to get
a table for tonight,

02:58.386 --> 02:59.512
you can forget it.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.431
-I'm booked solid.
-We don't care, Jimmy.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.559
I still got dopes calling
and begging for reservations.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.936
I just hold the phone down
to my butt and fart on 'em, so...

03:07.020 --> 03:09.105
Hey, Jimmy, people are still calling.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.482
Should I just keep farting?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.108
Yeah, if you got 'em locked and loaded.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.277
The last two were silent.
I had to tell 'em what I did.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.363
I'd send the overflow to you, Bob,

03:16.446 --> 03:19.157
but I know how scared you are
of actually having customers.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.369
-Zoom.
-Ha. You're standing in your own way.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.787
-Trev, don't...
-What? He is.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.414
Eh, let's go back.
I feel a fart coming on.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.041
I don't want to waste it in here.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.251
It wouldn't be a waste, Jimmy!

03:30.335 --> 03:31.586
-Good one, Dad.
-(groans)

03:31.670 --> 03:32.754
So why aren't we open late

03:32.837 --> 03:33.922
for Valentine's dinner?

03:34.005 --> 03:35.256
Well, we're not really a datey,

03:35.340 --> 03:36.633
romantic restaurant.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.677
We're just a "shove a burger
in your face" place.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.637
And a "sip on a soda and yak" shack.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.472
Yeah, but tonight the streets are crawling

03:42.555 --> 03:44.015
with romantic suckers who haven't gotten

03:44.099 --> 03:47.018
their crap together enough
to book a reservation someplace.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.103
Yeah, so?

03:48.186 --> 03:49.854
So they'd probably go anywhere tonight,

03:49.938 --> 03:51.314
even here.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.775
This is insulting but kind of inspiring?

03:53.858 --> 03:55.819
I do hate to think
of all those poor lovers

03:55.902 --> 03:57.696
with nowhere to go, sitting at home,

03:57.779 --> 03:59.155
crying into their microwave dinners.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.450
I mean, to do it right
we'd have to dress things up.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.202
Tablecloths, candles.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.662
You could borrow
the Valentine's decorations

04:05.745 --> 04:07.080
I got up in my apartment.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.416
You decorate your apartment
for Valentine's Day?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.459
Some of the rooms.
It's not weird that I do that.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.004
No, it's not weird.
It's just sad.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.715
I wonder how many people
we could pack into this dump.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.258
Teddy, do you think you could
pull the booths away

04:18.341 --> 04:20.385
from the wall so we could
squeeze two couples in each?

04:20.468 --> 04:22.595
Sure. I bet whoever put 'em in
didn't even attach 'em

04:22.679 --> 04:24.389
'cause they didn't know
you guys that well back then.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.266
Plus he might have been
going through a divorce

04:26.349 --> 04:29.644
and so he cut some corners
on some jobs sometimes. Uh...

04:29.728 --> 04:31.229
Maybe we go a little fancier
with the menu,

04:31.312 --> 04:32.480
like a <i>prix fixe?</i>

04:32.564 --> 04:33.648
I-I haven't ground the meat yet.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.151
Instead of burgers
I could do chuck steaks.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.570
We had a substitute teacher
named Chuck Steaks once.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.156
-Ooh, and wine.
-Right, wine. Uh, do we have enough?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.074
Yeah, we got a few bottles upstairs.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.284
Plus the backup bottles.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.036
Plus the emergency backup bottles.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.246
-Plus the secret emergency...
-Sounds like we're good.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.582
The real gold is in tableside services,

04:50.665 --> 04:52.709
which could be provided
by Gene and myself.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.962
Roses, candy,
serenades for tips, et cetera.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.049
Hmm. Don't know about that,
plus who would bus tables?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.884
You know I love getting my bus on, Dad,

05:00.967 --> 05:02.594
-but I'm going to Tammy's party.
-We'd cover it,

05:02.677 --> 05:04.095
and you'd be making so much money,

05:04.179 --> 05:06.348
you wouldn't even notice
how bad we are at bussing.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.391
-That's the spirit.
-Are we doing this, people?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.810
Are we making some dumb
desperate love money tonight?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.604
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Yay.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.439
Now, I don't think the name Bob's Burgers

05:14.522 --> 05:16.066
works with the new concept.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.234
Maybe for the night we're Bob.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.112
-GENE: Or Bugers.
-LINDA: Or Urge.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.822
Urge. It's kind of edgy.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.116
Yay, Urge.
Everybody's got 'em.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.994
My therapist says some are good
and some are perfectly normal,

05:28.078 --> 05:30.663
-but I should stop bringing them up.
-Okay, everybody, get to work.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.083
And Gene and I will get
the word about Urge out.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.542
The <i>wordge.</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:04.280
Wow. It looks amazing.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.825
TEDDY: I'd fall in love with a wig
on a basketball in here.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.868
Gene, I kind of wish
you weren't dressed like that.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.955
-It's a mood maker.
-Yeah, he's Cupid. Aw.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.332
And your T-shirt makes
a great diaper, Dad.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.835
Hmm.
Uh, Teddy, thanks for all your help.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.045
And, uh, see you tomorrow?

06:19.129 --> 06:21.423
-Whoa. Why?
-Well, tonight we're...

06:21.506 --> 06:24.551
-kind of just for couples.
-I mean... seven, eight, nine.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.303
There's an odd number of stools,
so I can be the one single.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.222
Plus I can spend some time with someone

06:29.305 --> 06:31.474
I'd like to get to know better. Me.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.893
You've been under your own nose
the whole time.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.645
Oh, crap.
Lin, our valentines.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.814
It's okay, we'll do 'em
later tonight, right?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.899
-When we're rich and gorgeous.
-Okay, pep talk.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.235
Mom, Dad, bring it in.
I love you, but... (sighs)

06:42.318 --> 06:44.738
-don't mess this up.
-Okay. That was fair.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.741
All right, now people just have to come.

06:48.992 --> 06:49.993
Mm.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.079
Hmm.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.415
-Okay, let's close.
-We gave it a shot.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.499
MAN AND WOMAN:
Oh, cute.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.251
Hello, hi, come on in.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.504
Oh, my God, we're a fancy,
successful restaurant.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.010
Hey there, chuck steak.
"Hiya, Bob."

07:07.093 --> 07:09.054
Whoa, cool deep voice, chuck steak.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.847
"So, you gonna grind me up or what?"

07:10.930 --> 07:14.059
No, because you're gonna be
a steak on a <i>prix fixe</i> menu.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.685
<i>"Prix fixe?"</i>
I thought you'd be excited.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.228
Uh, can I call you Chuck?

07:17.312 --> 07:18.396
"Maybe."

07:18.480 --> 07:19.939
So, welcome to Urge.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.358
Don't mind the couple on the other side

07:21.441 --> 07:22.817
of the privacy partition.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.361
You're way hotter than them.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.987
And, no, I did not say that to them, too.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.906
-(whispers): You're hotter.
-Happy to be anywhere.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.116
(laughs) Someone forgot
to make a reservation.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.451
Oh, like it's my job?

07:31.534 --> 07:32.827
Am I a professional
restaurant reservationist?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.913
No, I'm a professional doctor.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.499
Don't "I'm a doctor" me.
I'm a doctor, too.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.125
Okay, so we're both doctors. God.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.003
So, What about a drink?
A couple of large wines?

07:42.087 --> 07:44.172
-Sure.
-And for you?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.882
Folded paper rose for the lady, sir?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.425
Uh, yeah, I-I'll take one.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.010
Oh, you're only one rose in love?

07:49.094 --> 07:51.513
-No, we're probably at a two?
-Two?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.348
-I-I mean four.
-I could tell.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.940
Oh, my God, I love that song.
It's so tip-worthy.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.359
-In the diaper, please.
-Gene, no.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.027
This is Urge?

08:06.111 --> 08:09.948
-Oh, Hugo. Uh, Bob, Hugo's here.
-Ugh, why?

08:10.031 --> 08:13.201
I thought the address
looked familiar, in a bad way.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.577
Lot of changes, Bob.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.621
-Um, not that many.
-Hello.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.957
Hello. Bob, I see
the look of fear and respect

08:19.040 --> 08:20.583
in your eyes, but relax.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.836
I'm here as a sexy Valentine's diner,

08:22.919 --> 08:24.713
not a sexy health inspector.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.715
So you have a date?
Somehow?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.425
Cheryl is meeting me here.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.218
Bob, Linda, I'm in love.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.012
With my mother's description of her.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.681
Aw, that's nice.
Uh, why don't you sit over there?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.641
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, this isn't great.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.685
We've got extra tables and I'm pretty sure

08:38.768 --> 08:40.103
we're violating a bunch of codes.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.604
No, he says he just wants to have dinner.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.148
He's in love with some poor lady.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.026
All right, just bring him wine
with a lot of wine in it.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.235
So, a first date?

08:47.318 --> 08:49.320
Sounds like a paper rose situation to me.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.865
I'm gonna keep handing
you roses, you just say when.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.409
-Uh...
-First date on Valentine's, huh?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.702
It's kind of what I'm doing.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.537
And it's going pretty well,
if I do say so.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.372
Okay, 15 roses, that'll be $15.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.166
What?
No, one rose is plenty.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.710
And 15 songs?
Here we go.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.003
<i>TAMMY:</i>
<i>Guys,</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:06.963
welcome to my Anti-Valentine's Day party.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.591
Check it out: black balloons,
black tortilla chips,

09:09.674 --> 09:11.634
and black eye shadow on <i>moi.</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:13.386
-And your roots are black.
-Jocelyn.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.138
Let's do this.
And everybody that went

09:15.221 --> 09:16.473
to an overnight wrestling meet
without nailing down

09:16.556 --> 09:18.224
Valentine's Day plans can eat it.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.726
-(chuckles) Right?
-What?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.561
-Exactly.
-Now we do our oath.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.772
-Ooh, an oath. Hell yeah.
-Everyone, hands in.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.357
Whoa, lot of palms and fingers.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.609
No one try to hold my hand
in there, you hear? (chuckles)

09:27.692 --> 09:29.611
Hearts are farts and Cupid is stupid.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.156
Tonight we take our chance
on no romance. I so vow.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.366
ALL:
I so vow.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.034
Did we just marry Satan?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.370
Now we're gonna do whatever
an evenly numbered group

09:38.453 --> 09:40.121
of attractive teens feels like doing.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.831
Just good clean Anti-Valentine's fun.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.458
With Tammy's parents in the next room

09:43.541 --> 09:45.627
-to help keep a lid on things.
-TAMMY'S DAD: Bye, Tammy-love.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.462
Your mother and I are off
to see different movies

09:47.545 --> 09:49.547
-at the same theater.
-Bye. Leave already.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.758
Okay, there go the chaperones.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.678
Not that we're gonna need 'em.
Cool, cool, cool.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.558
If you like it, may I suggest a gratuity,

10:00.642 --> 10:03.228
and if you don't like it,
I can make him stop.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.437
For a gratuity.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.272
Oh, my God, we're so full.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.525
Hi, I'm Bob, I'm the chef.
H-How is everything?

10:08.608 --> 10:11.194
'Cause if it's not right,
I'll make it right.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.029
-We're good.
-Yeah, you are.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.406
Are you flirting with us?

10:14.489 --> 10:17.200
No, just feeling happy
and-and really confident.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.619
And maybe better-looking
than I was earlier today?

10:19.703 --> 10:21.746
-Oh, you're on cocaine.
-Is that what cocaine does?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.289
Are there any downsides?

10:23.373 --> 10:25.709
So, how's our Valentine's?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.336
-Good. Good.
-Most romantic night of the year.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.547
-But no pressure. (laughs)
-I'm having a good time.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.842
-We both are.
-(chuckles): Okay. Enjoy.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.677
I don't know what's going on
with these people.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.095
They're so uptight.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.014
It's like they got Cupid arrows
up their butts.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.933
Well, my diaper is full... of Washingtons.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.269
And we have five couples on the wait list.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.729
-We have a wait list?
-I don't know.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.022
What's it called when a bunch of idiots

10:47.105 --> 10:48.606
give their names
and stand outside in the cold?

10:48.690 --> 10:50.150
BOB:
(gasps) We have a wait list.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.943
We could do a second seating.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.361
I'll need to be changed at some point,

10:53.445 --> 10:54.779
but otherwise I'm in.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.698
Okay, I've got plenty of steaks.
What about wine?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.575
We're kind of burning through
it, but I guess we're okay?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.660
-Then we're going later, right?
-Yeah, I mean...

11:00.744 --> 11:02.537
we were gonna do <i>our</i> valentines later.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.372
-With wine, if there's any left.
-Crap.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.417
I keep forgetting about that.
In a romantic way?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.461
And think of the lovers out there, Mom.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.962
Their poor money getting all cold.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.340
It's fine.
We'll get to our valentines eventually.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.008
-This is worth it, right?
-Right.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.802
-And our valentines are gonna be so good.
-So good.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.221
Guys, Hugo's still sitting by himself,

11:20.305 --> 11:23.183
-but unlike me, he's not
carrying it off super well.
-Hmm.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.894
So, Hugo, we're still
waiting for your date?

11:25.977 --> 11:28.104
I don't understand it.
My mother told her

11:28.188 --> 11:29.856
that punctuality is my biggest turn-on.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.317
Then she's definitely on her way.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.693
I'll keep texting.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.945
Bob, not to be ticky-tacky,
but I've noticed that

11:36.029 --> 11:37.280
you're slightly over capacity,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.282
light levels are below OSHA standards,

11:39.366 --> 11:42.577
and you have candles without
an open-flame permit.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.747
Uh, yeah, but those are
kind of small things that are fine.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.791
-There's a boy in a diaper.
-True.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.292
At least I'm wearing the diaper.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.252
On some Cupids the diaper wears them.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.796
I'd hate to have to call my good friends

11:52.879 --> 11:55.674
at the fire department,
but if I have nothing else

11:55.757 --> 11:57.509
to do on Valentine's Day...

11:57.592 --> 12:00.053
Easy, Hugo, you're date's
gonna be here any second.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.596
Yeah, traffic.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.348
Please, please come, Hugo's date.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.101
-I mean, you'll regret it,
but please come.
-What was that, Bob?

12:06.184 --> 12:07.310
-Nothing.
-I hate you.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.729
So I finally got my head unstuck,

12:09.813 --> 12:11.314
and that was my worst Valentine's Day.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.857
Anyway, someone else?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.901
Or not.
You know, how about some music?

12:14.984 --> 12:16.820
I'm just gonna pick a playlist at random.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.447
Not that one, not that one.
Ooh, "Ultimate Snog Jams."

12:19.531 --> 12:21.658
-Don't even know what that is.
-(music playing)

12:21.741 --> 12:24.202
Huh, well, sure feels good
not to be looking

12:24.285 --> 12:25.370
for some lips to land on

12:25.453 --> 12:26.579
just 'cause of what day it is.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.790
-Is it really bright in here?
-Not really.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.417
Yeah, I'm gonna lower the lights.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.335
Okay, hey, Tammy, a word?

12:32.419 --> 12:34.337
I hope I'm wrong,
but I think some romance is

12:34.421 --> 12:37.048
-creeping into this party.
-I don't know what
you're talking about, Tina.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.426
Just remember our oath and watch
each other's backs.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.761
Anti-Val pals. Wow, that's a lot
of lip balm you're putting on.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.555
Oh, is it?

12:43.638 --> 12:46.474
Still no reply.
And that was my last text

12:46.558 --> 12:48.059
under my limited texting plan.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.811
She's really not gonna show up, is she?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.146
I mean, he did send a selfie of him

12:51.229 --> 12:52.313
pointing at his watch.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.898
Ah, she's not coming.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.152
I'm alone on Valentine's Day
surrounded by happy couples.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.945
Most of 'em aren't that happy.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.155
And they're not all couples.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.449
Some of us are single and sensational.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.617
I think the only possible way
I'm gonna feel better

13:04.701 --> 13:06.911
is to have the fire department
shut you down.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.080
-Come on, Hugo.
-Wait, let me rethink this.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.207
-Yeah?
-Nope, still makes me feel better.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.668
-What do we do?
-Gene, how quick can you get in a dress?

13:13.752 --> 13:15.795
You know my record is 3.5 seconds.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.172
We got to stall him somehow.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.631
Does anyone know the number

13:18.715 --> 13:20.300
for the head of fire code enforcement?

13:20.383 --> 13:21.676
Oh, that's right, I do.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.928
Uh, Hugo, your date's here.
She's been here.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.473
She's in the employee bathroom.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.059
Yeah.
She saw you on your way in.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.811
She thinks you're handsome,
but she's so nervous

13:31.895 --> 13:34.314
that she's had a bathroom emergency.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.649
And she's gorgeous.
She has, like, a hundred teeth.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.235
And we didn't tell you this
before because...

13:39.319 --> 13:41.946
Because she didn't want us to.
She's embarrassed.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.032
But why are you being so loyal to her?

13:44.115 --> 13:45.158
We're your best friends.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.244
-Yep, best friends.
-So, in a way,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.955
your date's going really well.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.832
Great, I'll call Mother and update her.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.919
The old "your date's
in the stall" stall. Love it.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.674
So, my date's in the employee bathroom.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.259
I knew there was a simple,
really good explanation.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.803
I don't know about really good.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.013
Bup-bup-bup.
Yeah, just an upset stomach.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.640
Happens all the time on Valentine's.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.225
They call it Cupid's revenge.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.185
-That's offensive.
-Poor thing.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.020
(whispering):
I can't believe Hugo's buying this.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.980
I can, he's like everyone else in here.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.982
He's desperate for a perfect Valentine's.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.609
It's flattering in a way.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.152
I gave a girl diarrhea.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.320
You charmer.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.697
Got to stay cool.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.824
I'm steering clear of romance
this Valentine's.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.242
Oh, probably should have
taken off my glasses

14:27.325 --> 14:28.451
before splashing myself.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.121
TAMMY:
Mmm...

14:31.204 --> 14:33.123
Tammy, no!
Take a breath. Take a step back.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.458
Whew, that was a close one.
Anti-Val pals.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.585
(chuckles)
Hearts are farts?

14:37.669 --> 14:40.547
Hearts aren't farts, Tina.
Hearts were never farts.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.258
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying trying not to be romantic

14:43.341 --> 14:45.802
is <i>really</i> romantic.
This is a party now.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.846
You mean anti-Anti-Valentine's?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.181
Now, we're gonna go in the closet
for six minutes and kiss.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.641
Jocelyn, are you hearing this?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.184
-Jocelyn!
-What?

14:56.521 --> 14:58.773
-Wonderful. Wonderful.
-It really is.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.608
So, by yourself tonight, sailor?

15:00.692 --> 15:03.570
-Not by myself. With myself.
-Good for you.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.489
-So glad I'm not that sad, lonely person.
-(entry bells jingle)

15:06.573 --> 15:09.117
So this is Urge, huh?
More like Purge.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.160
Ha. Rhymes.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.870
Get lost, Jimmy, we're busy.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.955
Yeah, I really don't have time
to be insulted right now

15:14.039 --> 15:16.708
because of all the customers we have.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.127
Yeah, you got 'em packed in like sardines.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.920
They look a little drunk and bloated.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.547
You know what, not bad.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.090
Guess I rubbed off on you a little bit.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.759
-I'm proud of you, Bob.
-What?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.094
Happy Valentine's Day, pal.
(choking up): Really proud.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.180
He's proud of you.
What's that feel like?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.640
-I don't want you to be
proud of me, Jimmy.
-Too late.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.225
-I don't accept it.
-You love it.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.068
Where is everybody?

15:43.151 --> 15:45.070
I don't know.
Are they all in the closet?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.780
Ugh!
Damn Valentine's Day!

15:46.863 --> 15:47.781
Look at me, whatever your name is.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.908
Austin.
I know Tammy from camp.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.035
I'm Tina.
Austin, we have a problem.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.162
But listen, just because
we're the only ones not kissing

15:54.245 --> 15:55.413
doesn't mean we're gonna kiss,

15:55.497 --> 15:56.664
even though it's really in the air.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.167
-So what do we do?
-Drown out this music somehow.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.169
Uh, I know, we'll sing

16:01.252 --> 16:03.171
the-the most unromantic song
we can think of.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.964
-Do you know any songs about barf?
-I mean, no.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.634
I'll just make one up.
♪ <i>Barf, barf, barf</i> ♪

16:16.810 --> 16:17.852
Aah!
Run, Austin, run!

16:17.936 --> 16:20.146
We got to get out of here.
Aah!

16:20.230 --> 16:23.566
-How many closets does this place have?
-I know. So much storage.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.236
Okay, we seated four new tables.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.405
-Whew, I'm kind of beat.
-Me, too.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.407
Teddy, you, uh, you saw
your check there, right?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.701
Oh, right, let me, uh...
Aah!

16:32.784 --> 16:34.452
Yeah, it's a little higher tonight.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.705
It's fine. What else am I gonna
blow my money on?

16:36.788 --> 16:39.040
Rent? Heart medicine?
(chuckles)

16:39.124 --> 16:40.625
So, as long as we can keep stalling Hugo,

16:40.709 --> 16:42.085
I guess we keep going.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.670
And it's fine that we're lying
and he's gonna

16:43.753 --> 16:45.463
-find out at some point, right?
-Sure.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.799
And it's fine that Jimmy Pesto
is proud of me.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.677
And, hey, if there's no wine
left for our valentines,

16:50.760 --> 16:52.303
or if we don't get to 'em at all,

16:52.387 --> 16:53.930
there's always next year, right?

16:54.014 --> 16:56.224
-The important thing is,
we were gonna do 'em.
-Right.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.101
Right. Because this was worth it.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.769
So worth it.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.521
Hell yeah, it was worth it.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.523
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy,
what's with all the standing up stuff?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.316
It's been a while.
I just want to make sure

17:05.400 --> 17:06.317
Cheryl's doing okay.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.569
No, no, no, no, girls hate it

17:07.652 --> 17:08.570
when you make sure they're doing okay.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.364
-He's on the move.
-Hugo, wait, wait.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.033
-No, no, no, no. Hugo.
-Trip him. Stab him.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.452
Cheryl, it's Hugo.
Are you all right?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.412
She's shy.
Give her some room.

17:17.495 --> 17:20.081
You're right, you're right.
Clingy me. I'll go back.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.499
Someone's in the other bathroom
and I can't make it upstairs

17:21.583 --> 17:23.877
so I need to get in there now.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.422
-But my date is in there.
-And you are wearing a diaper,
Gene, so why don't you...

17:27.505 --> 17:29.549
-Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
-Wha...

17:29.632 --> 17:32.469
Oh, my God, she flushed herself
down the toilet!

17:34.554 --> 17:35.930
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>I say we wait</i>

17:36.014 --> 17:37.557
till Gene leaves, then check all the nooks

17:37.640 --> 17:38.808
and crannies in there.
Who's with me?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.727
She was never here, was she?

17:40.810 --> 17:43.772
-She was... in our hearts?
-Yeah, she was.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.566
-Bob, Linda...
-You're actually okay

17:46.649 --> 17:48.526
and you're just gonna go home
and take a nice bath?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.236
Shut it down.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.654
-No!
-That's another way to go.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.032
I'm so sorry.
The astronauts were in the capsule,

17:54.115 --> 17:56.368
and there was no way
to stop the countdown.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.704
-I think we should stop now.
-Phew.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.040
-It's over, Austin from camp.
-We made it out.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.334
Without making out.
Should we hug? Probably not.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.127
Right? Right.
But, hey, let's remember the time

18:06.211 --> 18:07.754
we kicked Valentine's Day
in its heart-shaped butt.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.464
Okay.
See you.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.966
-(phone chimes)
-Oh, a text on the emergency phone.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.219
"Hi, Tina.
Happy Valentine's Day."

18:14.302 --> 18:15.595
<i>JIMMY JR.:</i>
<i>Heart emoji.</i>

18:15.679 --> 18:17.097
-Aw.
-(phone chimes)

18:17.180 --> 18:18.807
<i>Uh, hope you have the emergency phone</i>

18:18.890 --> 18:20.934
<i>instead of your dad, like that one time.</i>

18:21.017 --> 18:22.686
Damn, I love Valentine's Day.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.896
Did you just say you love Valentine's Day?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.731
Nope. See you.
Texting back.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.150
Heart emoji, kiss emoji, wink emoji.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.568
Whoops, not vomit emoji.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.278
Uh, announcement.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.532
Urge is closing a little early
tonight, like now.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.950
-What?
-(disgruntled gasps)

18:37.033 --> 18:38.535
Sorry, people who just got here.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.537
Excuse me, I need to blow out that candle.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.955
(blows) Excuse me.
(blows) Excuse me.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.331
What's going on?

18:43.415 --> 18:45.625
We came so close to success, I smelled it.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.919
It smelled weird.
Good weird.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.964
To be honest, we were
kind of winging it tonight.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.340
We're really a burger place.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.467
It-It's not fancy, but it's fine.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.970
-My son is usually dressed.
-Am I, though?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.304
You know, it's a pretty good deal, too.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.681
This version's kind of a rip-off.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.559
Not a rip-off.
I mean, we did charge a lot more,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.102
but we-we threw in candles and stuff.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.147
Yeah, but listen, people,
maybe all that junk

19:07.230 --> 19:08.815
just adds to the pressure
that everything's

19:08.898 --> 19:10.859
got to be perfect on this one night.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.319
Valentine's can just be
with the one you love,

19:13.403 --> 19:14.571
and it doesn't matter where.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.781
This is probably more than
we need to hear right now.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.409
It's true.
Our Valentine's was just gonna be

19:19.492 --> 19:21.911
us writing down the ten things
we love about each other.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.206
Like I love that Linda
sacrificed her night for this.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.958
Not as much for the money,

19:27.042 --> 19:29.878
but so you guys would have
somewhere to go.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.589
I mean, money's good,
and I love that Bob's a dreamer

19:32.672 --> 19:34.841
who just wanted a fancy
restaurant for one night.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.385
-And I love...
-Oh, my God, are you really
doing ten of these?

19:37.469 --> 19:38.845
No, ten's crazy.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.555
I don't know what we were thinking.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.974
-Maybe a couple more?
-I love that Linda says "vroom vroom"

19:43.058 --> 19:44.392
when she turns on the coffee maker.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.935
Oh, I had that one on my list.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.688
I love that Bob's mustache
flutters when he sneezes.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.482
I guess Mom and Dad
are doing their valentines.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.609
Out loud and in front of strangers.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.236
Those romantic sons of bitches.
Play something nice.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.529
-Baby-making music?
-You know it.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.906
WOMAN:
Hugo?

19:57.989 --> 20:00.617
You look exactly like
your mother described you.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.410
Cheryl? You're here.
What happened?

20:02.494 --> 20:05.372
-Sorry I'm so late.
I went to the wrong Urge.
-Really?

20:05.455 --> 20:07.040
Yeah.
There's one in Bog Harbor.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.751
It's more of a sex toy shop
with a theater in the back.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.670
Oh.
Did you see all my texts?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.963
Well, you turn off your phone
when you're in the theater.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.465
I'm kidding.
My battery died.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.466
You're delightful.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.677
Bob, re-Urge the place, pronto.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.804
Yeah, we're back in business, baby.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.640
Honestly, I kind of just
want to be our old restaurant again.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.600
Tell you what, h-how about a burger?

20:25.684 --> 20:26.643
I'd love a burger.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.019
They're delicious.
And afterwards,

20:28.103 --> 20:29.437
you still got a little money left.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.314
You can buy heart medicine and not die.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.108
I'd have a burger.
Do you want a burger?

20:33.191 --> 20:34.484
I could go for a burger, yeah.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.278
Valentine's burgers, all right.
Anyone else?

20:37.362 --> 20:40.115
-Bob, can you leave a candle on one table?
-Sure.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.866
We're doing this again next year, right?

20:41.950 --> 20:43.576
-Eh...
-Eh... we'll see.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.953
Or you know what's coming up?

20:45.036 --> 20:46.788
Presidents' Day.
Some paper flags.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.581
This guy as a little Lincoln.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.291
Same outfit, just add hat and beard.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.377
-I'd eat there.
-Oh, I got to grind some meat.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.837
(as steak):
"What's happening?"

20:53.920 --> 20:55.296
We're doing burgers, Chuck.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.881
"Wait, what?"
Oh, sorry, I...

20:56.965 --> 20:58.883
(chuckles)
"Just kidding, I'm into it.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.844
Grind me, Bob.
Do it!"

21:33.960 --> 21:35.920
