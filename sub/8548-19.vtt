11:35.495 --> 11:36.696
YEAH, I GET IT.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.399
I JUST DON'T WANT IT
IN MY LIVING ROOM.

11:46.506 --> 11:50.310
THEN URKEL TOLD BULL HE WASN'T
GONNA GIVE HIM ANY MORE MONEY.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.212
BULL'S GOING
TO KILL HIM!

11:52.279 --> 11:53.246
COME ON.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.647
NOBODY'S GOING
TO GET HURT.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.217
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
TWO SEVENTH GRADERS.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.019
YEAH, BUT BULL'S BEEN
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE

11:59.086 --> 12:01.254
SINCE THE CARTER
ADMINISTRATION.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.457
GET REAL.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.493
NO. I SAW HIM,
EDDIE.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.196
HE'S AT LEAST 17,
AND HE'S MEAN.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.399
THEY DON'T CALL HIM BULL BECAUSE
HE WORKS FOR MERRILL LYNCH.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.737
YOU KNOW, IN
A STRANGE SORT OF WAY,

12:17.805 --> 12:20.073
I THINK I JUST
MIGHT MISS URKEL.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.444
HI, GUYS.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.346
FORGET I SAID THAT.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.985
LAURA,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.355
I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.324
IT'S NOT ALIVE,
IS IT?

12:37.390 --> 12:38.725
NO. IT'S A NECKLACE.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.028
I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT TO
YOU ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT,

12:41.094 --> 12:44.297
BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE I'LL BE DEAD.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.204
URKEL...

12:51.271 --> 12:52.372
WHAT IS THIS?

12:52.439 --> 12:53.974
MY RETAINER.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.244
I HAD IT BRONZED.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.579
YOU SEE THAT LITTLE LUMP
RIGHT THERE IN THE FRONT?

12:59.646 --> 13:02.549
WELL, IT'S A SESAME SEED.
I NEVER COULD DISLODGE IT.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.286
I'LL TREASURE THIS.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.789
ANY CHANCE I COULD
GET A KISS GOODBYE?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.226
URKEL, I'M WEARING
YOUR TEETH.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.428
THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.365
STEVE, YOU DON'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST THIS GUY.

13:18.431 --> 13:22.002
I DON'T SEE WHAT GETTING
BEAT UP IS GONNA PROVE.

13:22.069 --> 13:25.805
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING SMALL.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.141
NO ONE'S EVER
CALLED YOU SHRIMP.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.110
BIG GUYS HAVE
NEVER PLAYED KEEP-AWAY

13:30.177 --> 13:32.712
WITH YOUR HAT
ON A COLD DAY.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.247
DURING
THE CLASS PICTURE

13:34.314 --> 13:37.084
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIT WITH
THE GIRLS IN THE FRONT ROW

13:37.150 --> 13:39.652
AND HOLD UP
THE CLASS SIGN.

13:39.719 --> 13:44.424
AND MOST OF ALL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DEAL WITH BULLIES.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.459
I MEAN, I'M A FAST
RUNNER, EDDIE,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.761
BUT SOONER OR LATER,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.064
YOU JUST GOT
TO STOP RUNNING.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.614
DAD, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.050
SURE, SON.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

14:10.117 --> 14:13.020
WELL, TOMORROW AFTER
SCHOOL, AT LEROY'S,

14:13.086 --> 14:15.989
STEVE URKEL'S
GOING TO GET BEAT UP.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.891
WHAT DID HE DO?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.492
NOTHING.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.361
THERE'S JUST THIS BIG GUY
WHO DOESN'T LIKE HIM

14:21.428 --> 14:23.630
AND HE KEEPS TAKING
HIS LUNCH MONEY.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.066
URKEL FINALLY DECIDED
TO STAND UP TO HIM.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.769
SO NOW YOU WANT
TO GET INVOLVED?

14:29.836 --> 14:31.204
DAD, I DON'T KNOW.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.508
IS THAT THE RIGHT
THING TO DO?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.978
WELL, IT MIGHT BE.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.046
URKEL DOESN'T STRIKE ME

14:39.112 --> 14:41.248
AS A GUY WHO CAN
DEFEND HIMSELF.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.650
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT I SHOULD
STEP IN?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.252
NOT NECESSARILY.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.887
SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
LET URKEL FIGHT HIS OWN FIGHT?

14:47.955 --> 14:49.990
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.891
DAD, IS IT ME,

14:51.959 --> 14:54.761
OR ARE YOU NOT
MAKING ANY SENSE?

14:54.827 --> 14:57.730
SON, LOOK,
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.199
YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A BULLY HERE.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.768
AND MOST BULLIES
ARE COWARDS AT HEART.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.971
THAT'S WHY THEY
PICK ON LITTLE GUYS.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.539
SO IF A BIG GUY LIKE YOURSELF
STANDS UP TO A BULLY,

15:06.606 --> 15:08.275
THEY USUALLY BACK DOWN.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.443
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IF I JUST SHOW UP,

15:10.510 --> 15:13.046
THE GUY MIGHT SEE ME
AND CHICKEN OUT?

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.950
DAD, I DON'T GET IT.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.886
I MEAN, SHOULD I
DEFEND URKEL OR NOT?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.621
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.655
ON WHAT?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.024
ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE

15:24.091 --> 15:25.993
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO SHOULD BE PROTECTED

15:26.059 --> 15:28.128
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
PROTECT THEMSELVES.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.264
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

15:31.331 --> 15:32.599
I SURE DO.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.968
THAT'S WHY I BECAME A COP.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.803
LOOK, EDDIE,
I KNOW YOU CAME TO ME

15:36.869 --> 15:39.172
FOR A SIMPLE YES OR NO ANSWER,

15:39.239 --> 15:40.540
BUT I HONESTLY
CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT

15:40.607 --> 15:42.309
TO TELL YOU WHETHER
YOU SHOULD GET INVOLVED

15:42.375 --> 15:44.244
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S
FIGHT OR NOT.

15:44.311 --> 15:48.015
THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO MAKE ON YOUR OWN.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.683
I JUST WANT TO DO THE RIGHT
THING.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.319
I KNOW
THAT YOU WILL.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.626
THERE ARE CHANCES
OF DRY SHOWERS

15:59.692 --> 16:01.294
THROUGHOUT
THE TRI-STATE REGION.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.264
OH, OH, COME ON, GUYS!
COME ON, THIS IS IT!

16:04.331 --> 16:06.633
CONNIE TOYOTA
IS DOING THE WEATHER.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.335
TRAFFIC IS NEXT.

16:08.401 --> 16:12.139
I HOPE CARL COMES TO HIS SENSES
AND DUMPS THOSE STUPID JOKES.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.408
I'LL PRETEND
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.010
I'M SO EXCITED.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.978
THE LAST TIME
I SAW CARL PERFORM,

16:19.046 --> 16:22.949
IT WAS IN
A SCHOOL PLAY
ON DENTAL HYGIENE.

16:23.016 --> 16:26.253
HE PLAYED
MR. TOOTH DECAY.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.599
OKAY, WE GOT 30 SECONDS TO AIR,
CARL, HOW YOU DOING?

16:39.666 --> 16:43.370
JUST GREAT. I GOT A MILLION
TRAFFIC JOKES. WANNA HEAR ONE?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.038
JOKES? DIDN'T
ANYONE TELL YOU

16:45.105 --> 16:47.006
THAT'S WHAT GOT
OFFICER BUD FIRED?

16:47.074 --> 16:48.375
WHAT? BUT THAT'S
ALL I'VE GOT.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.510
HERE WE GO. WE'RE READY.
LET'S CLEAR THE SET.

16:50.577 --> 16:54.347
AND IN 5, 4, 3, 2...

16:54.414 --> 16:56.449
AND NOW WITH THIS
AFTERNOON'S TRAFFIC REPORT,

16:56.516 --> 16:59.186
HERE'S OFFICER
CARL WINSLOW.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.526
HI.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.595
I'M OFFICER
CARL WINSLOW

17:08.661 --> 17:11.431
WITH THE AFTERNOON
TRAFFIC REPORT.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.666
OH, AND SPEAKING
OF TRAFFIC--

17:13.733 --> 17:15.402
OW!

17:15.468 --> 17:16.603
OH.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.171
SORRY, CONNIE.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.410
SPEAKING OF PAIN
AND SUFFERING,

17:23.476 --> 17:25.345
THIS GUY ASKS HIS DOCTOR

17:25.412 --> 17:28.181
IF HE HAS
48 HOURS TO LIVE,

17:28.248 --> 17:29.449
AND HIS DOCTOR SAYS,

17:29.516 --> 17:31.784
"YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED ME YESTERDAY."

17:33.653 --> 17:35.922
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.224
HE'S DYING.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.895
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE'S MANGLING MY JOKES.

17:42.962 --> 17:46.833
ANYBODY MIND
IF I CHANGE THE CHANNEL?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.335
NOT YET.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.936
COME ON, CARL.
JUST BE YOURSELF.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.404
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.940
OH, OH, OH, I GOT IT NOW.
I GOT IT NOW.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.176
SEE, THIS DOCTOR
AND HIS PATIENT

17:56.243 --> 17:57.710
WALK INTO THIS BAR.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.412
PSST!

17:59.479 --> 18:00.480
HI.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.081
READ THIS.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.585
THERE'S
AN OVERTURNED TANKER

18:05.652 --> 18:07.720
ON THE STEVENSON EXPRESSWAY

18:07.787 --> 18:09.088
NEAR CICERO BOULEVARD.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.790
TRAFFIC IS BLOCKED
IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.425
IF YOU'RE HEADING
INTO DOWNTOWN,

18:12.492 --> 18:14.361
TAKE THE SERVICE ROAD.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.163
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU CAN'T
TAKE THE SERVICE ROAD.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.697
THEY'RE REPAIRING THAT.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.834
IF YOU TAKE IT, YOU'LL
BE STUCK FOR A MONTH.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.406
HERE'S YOUR
OVERTURNED TANKER.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.409
YOUR BEST BET
IS TO GET OFF AT CENTRAL,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.678
CONTINUE EAST
UNTIL YOU COME TO ARCHER.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.446
YOU CAN'T MISS IT
'CAUSE RIGHT ON THE CORNER,

18:33.513 --> 18:35.848
THERE'S A DON'S DOUGHNUT SHOP,

18:35.915 --> 18:38.318
AND IF YOU GOT A MINUTE,
DROP IN.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.753
THEY GOT
THE BEST CRULLERS IN TOWN.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.888
WAY TO GO,
CARL!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.022
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT

18:43.089 --> 18:44.957
IF YOU'D JUST BE YOURSELF!

18:45.024 --> 18:47.727
THAT'S MY SON.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.362
WHILE I GOT MY PEN OUT,

18:49.429 --> 18:52.832
LET ME SHOW YOU A BACK WAY
INTO WRIGLEY FIELD.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.110
DID ALL YOU PEOPLE
COME HERE

19:04.177 --> 19:06.413
JUST TO SEE
A BLOOD BATH?

19:06.479 --> 19:08.515
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS?

19:08.581 --> 19:12.185
YEAH. YEAH.
YEAH.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.758
STEVE, YOU CAN STILL
BACK OUT, YOU KNOW.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.728
NO. I'VE
MADE UP MY MIND.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.263
A MAN'S GOT TO DO

19:23.330 --> 19:26.466
WHAT A MAN'S
GOT TO DO.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.901
YEAH, BUT WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.318
GOOD AFTERNOON,
BULL.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.687
YOU'RE LOOKING
DAPPER AS USUAL.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.225
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
ONE LAST CHANCE, WEASEL.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.428
HAND OVER THE MONEY.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.765
SORRY, BULL, BUT
THE BANK IS CLOSED.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.867
OOH.
OOH.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.370
OKAY.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.071
NICE KNOWING YOU,
DWEEB.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.105
OH!

20:06.172 --> 20:07.774
HOLD IT!

20:13.313 --> 20:16.583
THE FIGHT'S OVER,
BULL.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.451
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.554
THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND THE DORK.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.490
BUTT OUT!

20:23.556 --> 20:24.624
AS LONG
AS EDDIE'S HERE,

20:24.691 --> 20:26.326
LET'S BE OPEN
TO HIS INPUT.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.598
BULL, WE ALL KNOW
THAT YOU'RE TOUGH, MAN.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.267
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BEAT UP URKEL TO PROVE IT.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.769
I MEAN,
HE'S A SMALL, DEFENSELESS,

20:36.836 --> 20:38.538
PUNY, PATHETIC,
WEAK, WIMPY, SCRAWNY--

20:38.605 --> 20:41.240
UH, EDDIE,
EDDIE, EDDIE.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.242
I THINK YOU
MADE YOUR POINT.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.914
OKAY...

20:49.248 --> 20:51.083
HE'S OFF THE HOOK,

20:51.150 --> 20:52.452
BUT YOU,

20:52.519 --> 20:53.953
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

20:54.020 --> 20:54.821
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

20:54.887 --> 20:55.955
OHH!

20:57.023 --> 21:01.561
OHH. OKAY.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.365
ALRIGHT.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.567
I'LL LEAVE HIM ALONE.

21:09.669 --> 21:10.437
YEAH!

21:10.503 --> 21:12.605
YEAH!
WHOO!
WHOO!

21:12.672 --> 21:13.740
ALRIGHT!

21:13.806 --> 21:14.974
WOW!

21:15.041 --> 21:17.344
YOU SAVED MY LIFE,
EDDIE!

21:17.410 --> 21:19.412
YEAH, I DID.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.213
THAT MEANS
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS,

21:21.280 --> 21:24.050
BUDDIES, PALS,
AMIGOS, GOOMBAHS!

21:26.052 --> 21:28.921
STEVE, DON'T MAKE ME REGRET
THAT I DID THIS.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.992
OH, EDDIE,
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.561
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
EDDIE.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.029
ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S CELEBRATE!

21:37.096 --> 21:38.531
DRINKS ON ME!

21:38.598 --> 21:40.833
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH! YEAH!

21:40.900 --> 21:42.369
WHOO!
WHOO!

21:45.572 --> 21:47.974
I LOVE YOU CRAZY GUYS!

21:53.045 --> 21:54.381
DAD!

21:55.582 --> 21:57.550
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

21:58.718 --> 22:02.321
WELL, I WAS ON MY WAY HOME
FROM THE TV STUDIO,

22:02.389 --> 22:05.257
AND I DECIDED
TO STOP IN

22:05.324 --> 22:07.594
FOR A LITTLE SNACK.
COFFEE, PLEASE.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.196
YEAH? SO HOW DID
THE TRAFFIC REPORT GO?

22:10.262 --> 22:11.464
WELL, A LITTLE SHAKY
AT FIRST,

22:11.531 --> 22:13.566
BUT I GOT THE JOB.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.936
GREAT! CAN YOU INTRODUCE ME
TO CONNIE TOYOTA?

22:17.003 --> 22:20.206
WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY
ON HER GOOD SIDE

22:20.272 --> 22:21.541
AT THE MOMENT.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.477
SO...

22:24.544 --> 22:26.679
DID ANYTHING INTERESTING

22:26.746 --> 22:28.080
HAPPEN AROUND
HERE TODAY?

22:29.549 --> 22:31.651
DAD, YOU CAME HERE

22:31.718 --> 22:33.520
TO CHECK UP ON ME,
DIDN'T YOU?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.988
YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT THE FIGHT.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.223
FIGHT?

22:37.289 --> 22:38.891
WAS THAT TODAY?

22:38.958 --> 22:42.562
YEAH, BUT I TALKED THE BULLY
OUT OF HITTING URKEL.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.532
OH, HE BACKED DOWN
JUST LIKE I SAID.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.267
NO. HE CAME AFTER ME.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.368
I HAD TO FIGHT HIM.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.470
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:50.537 --> 22:51.804
YEAH, I'M FINE.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.973
IN FACT, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.309
WELL, SON,

22:57.376 --> 22:58.678
I'M PROUD OF YOU,

22:59.712 --> 23:00.913
BUT I DON'T
WANT YOU TO THINK

23:00.980 --> 23:03.483
THAT FIGHTING IS
ALWAYS THE ANSWER.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.817
OH, I KNOW THAT.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.853
BUT IT REALLY WASN'T
MUCH OF A FIGHT.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.688
I HIT HIM ONCE,
AND HE WENT DOWN.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.824
OH, WAS IT THAT FAMOUS
WINSLOW PUNCH I TAUGHT YOU?

23:11.891 --> 23:15.127
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST CLOSED
MY EYES AND SWUNG.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.696
THAT'S THE ONE.
