be a new home

MR. TERRIFIC: Gotta hand it
to Calculator, he's clever.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.634
I can't locate my T-Spheres
by any conventional means.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.436
It would have been
impossible to
cloak my "S-Cubes."

Please don't bring that up.

I become the adult in this?

Now, what's this
all about? Really?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.087
Stein is crazy.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.790
He thinks I stole the
idea for my T-Spheres
from his science project.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.559
I just think it's
quite a coincidence

04:21.594 --> 04:24.162
that he happens to invent
his ridiculous globes

while I was developing
my magnificent S-Cubes
in the very next room!

04:28.568 --> 04:30.368

he was a prodigy.

How did he split us up?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.048
The T-Spheres
can hack into any system.

06:24.083 --> 06:27.118
They saw Firestorm as just
another system to deprogram.

06:27.153 --> 06:30.021
Huh? They can do that?

06:30.056 --> 06:33.858
That's... Phew.
That's pretty impressive.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.460
Thanks. Yeah,
they're pretty great.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.728

that in writing.

us find your friend.

You believe these things?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.620
I would never burn my hair.

07:02.655 --> 07:03.822
Glad that's sorted out.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.824
So, I'm just gonna
pop back home,

you a latte, of course,
