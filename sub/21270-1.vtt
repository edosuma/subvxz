02:29.963 --> 02:34.676

I mean you know,

16:34.098 --> 16:38.977

looks like a cock and balls.

16:38.978 --> 16:39.437
Aahh!

16:39.438 --> 16:42.981
But obviously, it
looks like a gun. Right?

16:42.982 --> 16:46.611
Yeah so anyway, we should uh
we should give you the tour.

16:46.694 --> 16:48.612
5 zones; A through E.

16:48.613 --> 16:51.448
Uh Montclair's, that
place you came in through.

16:51.449 --> 16:52.115
That's Zone A.

16:52.116 --> 16:56.286
Other thing I want to
do suited and booted.

16:56.287 --> 16:57.203
Looking nice.

16:57.204 --> 17:00.291
Get that on take
you for the rest.

17:01.334 --> 17:04.044
First up zone B.
Shopper's Row.

17:04.045 --> 17:05.795
You know why they
call it Shopper's Row?

17:05.796 --> 17:07.672
Cause this is where all
the shopping happens.

17:07.673 --> 17:09.340
Want to buy something
nice for your sweetie?

17:09.342 --> 17:10.717
This is the place to do it.

17:10.718 --> 17:13.345
Zone C. The Food court.

17:13.346 --> 17:15.387
Everything in here will
kill you seriously.

17:15.388 --> 17:17.015
Bring your own food.
Just around the corner

17:17.016 --> 17:19.559
there you've got a
beautiful view of the car park.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.895
Only thing that happens there is
America's finest come in they

17:21.896 --> 17:24.606
shine their lights around
like they're doing something.

17:24.607 --> 17:25.857
They just drive off
and don't do shit.

17:25.858 --> 17:29.569
Zone D. Now this is usually my
least favorite part of the tour

17:29.570 --> 17:33.406
but recently they just installed
this new competition for this

17:33.407 --> 17:33.907
baby over here.

17:33.908 --> 17:36.576
Best part is once a week we
get to drive it around so the

17:36.577 --> 17:38.328
battery doesn't go flat.
So if you play your cards

17:38.329 --> 17:39.913
right you might get to
ride on it Del Fuego.

17:39.914 --> 17:41.790
It's not its real name,
it's a name I made up.

17:41.791 --> 17:44.417
All right you ready
for the grand finale?

17:44.418 --> 17:45.835
Here it is.

17:45.836 --> 17:49.048
Clyve's the other department store.

17:49.173 --> 17:51.591
The better department store.
This place is amazing.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.968
You got designer clothes,
you got brand names here,

17:53.969 --> 17:56.012
you got even there's a
machine you put a quarter in,

17:56.013 --> 17:58.348
it comes out with
your name on it. Like wow.

17:58.349 --> 18:00.892
I mean the fact they wanted to
have our HQ just down there but

18:00.893 --> 18:04.229
Montclair's was built first so
we were sent off down that way.

18:04.230 --> 18:07.941
And they replaced us with
this riot barricade if you

18:07.942 --> 18:11.486
believe that. Anyway
that's the tour pretty much.

18:11.487 --> 18:13.446
So uh you got any questions?

18:13.447 --> 18:14.864
Just one.

18:14.865 --> 18:15.407
Shoot.

18:15.408 --> 18:20.245
Riot barricades, tasers, a five
man night crew for a mall.

18:20.246 --> 18:24.082
No offense but it looks
like you got stuck in 1992.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.042
Okay I'm going to
stop you there cowboy.

18:26.043 --> 18:28.086
You're not from here are you?

18:28.087 --> 18:28.504
No.

18:28.505 --> 18:31.507
Can I ask you.
What exactly are you doing here?

18:31.590 --> 18:33.133
I needed a job.

18:33.134 --> 18:35.093
Okay sure.

18:35.094 --> 18:39.723
Uh anyway down this way you've
got the next town over it's got

18:39.724 --> 18:43.226
a population 12,640 people.

18:43.227 --> 18:45.478
Last year it had 48 murders.
Right?

18:45.479 --> 18:52.902
Over this side you've got
another town population 25,328.

18:52.903 --> 18:55.405
Last year had 81 murders.

18:55.406 --> 18:56.406
Meth.

18:56.407 --> 18:58.158
A whole lotta meth.

18:58.159 --> 19:01.828
Seriously and a really, really
nasty gang controlling it.

19:01.829 --> 19:05.331
So you got a whole lotta people
stealing to feed habits you

19:05.332 --> 19:08.793
know what I mean? You know
what, you catch on pretty fast.

19:08.794 --> 19:10.628
You ask astute questions.

19:10.629 --> 19:14.090
Hey if you don't mind me saying,
You keep in amazing shape.

19:14.091 --> 19:16.594

19:26.145 --> 19:27.562
Wow not bad.

19:27.563 --> 19:31.524
Um so thing is, I have some
experience with your people

19:31.525 --> 19:34.527
before and the main
problem I've got is you

19:34.528 --> 19:35.862
forget who's in charge.

19:35.863 --> 19:38.072
No, no, no I'm not
here to rock the boat.

19:38.073 --> 19:40.408
Now see that's what
I wanted to hear.

19:40.409 --> 19:42.661
See I knew we were
going to get on.

19:42.787 --> 19:45.538
That's a why do I have
my hands on a guy?

19:45.539 --> 19:46.498
Sorry about that.

19:46.499 --> 19:49.876
Okay yeah anyway straight down
to business then I guess.

19:49.877 --> 19:51.211
So uh you got your walkie there.

19:51.212 --> 19:54.255
You wanna be on channel 4 the
whole time. And when you do

19:54.256 --> 19:57.550
your passes, you want to do
two loops same as we just did.

19:57.551 --> 19:58.468
We'll get you started right now.

19:58.469 --> 20:00.720

anything kind of strange, little

20:00.721 --> 20:04.474
bit weird, make sure you phone
it in before doing anything.

20:04.475 --> 20:06.518

Don't want you doing

20:06.519 --> 20:07.894

safe now and they're leaving.

47:16.897 --> 47:21.234
I've uh-spoken to our mutual
employer and after tonight's

47:21.235 --> 47:26.197
little snafu,
there's now a bonus in place.

47:26.198 --> 47:29.742
If we succeed and the
girl dies, each one of you

47:29.743 --> 47:33.497
gets an extra
100 thousand dollars.

47:34.039 --> 47:36.667
Here's the rub;

47:37.084 --> 47:42.423
if we fail, if she
lives to see another day-

47:42.798 --> 47:46.176
every last one of you will
be hunted down and killed.

47:46.177 --> 47:52.016
Your family, friends, pets
will follow in short order.

47:52.933 --> 47:55.894
So needless to say,

47:55.895 --> 48:00.608
I strongly recommend getting

Where?

01:01:49.853 --> 01:01:50.728
My Uncle Will's.

01:01:50.729 --> 01:01:53.939
I used to spend summers
there when I was a kid.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.692
I loved it.

01:01:56.443 --> 01:01:58.778
It was so...

01:01:59.487 --> 01:02:01.239
normal.

01:02:04.034 --> 01:02:07.954
Then one year my dad told
me I couldn't go anymore.

01:02:09.497 --> 01:02:11.790
Well...

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:15.670
Dads aren't always perfect.
You know?

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.965
Yeah, but at least most of them
are around once in a while.

01:02:19.966 --> 01:02:20.924
And they're not criminals.

01:02:20.925 --> 01:02:24.303
It's... It's like you're trying
to defend him or something.

01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:26.723
I'm not defending him.

01:02:28.016 --> 01:02:32.145
But it's hard to know why
people do things sometimes.

01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:36.231
He might not have been around
much because he was afraid.

01:02:36.232 --> 01:02:38.442
Afraid? Afraid of what?

01:02:38.443 --> 01:02:41.863
Afraid of putting you in danger.

01:02:44.115 --> 01:02:47.035
Of being the one to hurt you.

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:53.500
Maybe he was afraid of himself.

01:03:03.885 --> 01:03:05.637
I don't know.

01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:09.391
But right now-

01:03:11.434 --> 01:03:15.313

here tonight be for nothing,

01:11:08.411 --> 01:11:10.538

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.006
So what do we do?

01:11:21.007 --> 01:11:24.551

did with Ruby's things?

01:11:24.552 --> 01:11:27.138

01:11:27.638 --> 01:11:29.807

01:11:30.057 --> 01:11:35.186

01:11:40.276 --> 01:11:41.526
Okay.

01:11:41.527 --> 01:11:45.572
Now it'll have
emergency channels.

01:11:45.573 --> 01:11:49.701
They'll be static at first,
but if I do my job,

01:11:49.702 --> 01:11:50.619
they'll go clear.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:55.665
Now when that happens, I need
you to find a place to hide

01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:56.499

I know you can hear me.

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:38.120
We were on a ten mile stretch
of wooded highway, Jamie.

01:14:38.329 --> 01:14:42.123
The rain prevented skid-marks
and we towed all the cars away.

we hit your convoy.

That's what people do when
things get complicated.

01:19:02.926 --> 01:19:08.598
When I was about your age my
father woke me one morning

01:19:08.599 --> 01:19:11.434
and told me to pack a bag.
We had a train to catch.

01:19:11.435 --> 01:19:13.395
I was excited.

01:19:13.812 --> 01:19:17.440
I'd only been away from
home a few times before,

01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:18.858
only for day-trips.

01:19:18.859 --> 01:19:21.028
I fell asleep.

01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:24.073
When I woke my father was gone.

01:19:26.617 --> 01:19:31.246
There was fifty quid
in my jacket pocket.

01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:36.835
I never saw him again.

01:19:41.965 --> 01:19:44.802
So, I'm going to
make you a deal.

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:49.181
From one betrayed,
abandoned soul to another.

for you to die.

you a thing or two.

You have a really important
decision to make, Jamie.

01:20:52.786 --> 01:20:55.705
You can be the child who waits
for the white knight who never

01:20:55.706 --> 01:21:00.084
comes. You can be immature,
brave and stupid and make a run

01:21:00.085 --> 01:21:05.924
for it in which case I'll have
no choice but to kill you.

01:21:07.759 --> 01:21:14.516
Or you can stand up and we
deal with this like adults.
