00:02.231 --> 00:04.198
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.198 --> 00:07.164
Chef Ramsay heads
to hot, trendy Miami,

00:07.164 --> 00:11.764
but ends up in a place
that's stuck in the past.

00:11.764 --> 00:13.264
It's almost antique.

00:13.264 --> 00:17.364
It was once the best
family restaurant in town.

00:17.364 --> 00:19.898
You couldn't get in here
on a Friday or Saturday night.

00:19.898 --> 00:21.031
But all that is left
from the glory days

00:21.031 --> 00:22.831
Is their all-pink decor

00:22.831 --> 00:24.998
and menu that features
food from Denmark.

00:27.164 --> 00:29.831
Which is being prepared
by a Cuban chef.

00:29.831 --> 00:30.000
Wham! Yah!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.998
Wham! Yah!

00:31.998 --> 00:33.931
And eaten by a shrinking
clientele...

00:33.931 --> 00:35.031
Health situations.

00:35.031 --> 00:37.098
Oh, well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

00:37.098 --> 00:38.598
That is on life support.

00:38.598 --> 00:41.698
You can't worry just about
what the old farts think.

00:41.698 --> 00:43.664
Tonight, in one
of the biggest challenges

00:43.664 --> 00:45.731
that Gordon has ever faced...

00:45.731 --> 00:47.831
We just contaminated
the whole  place!

00:47.831 --> 00:51.164
He attempts to change an owner
who hasn't changed a thing.

00:51.164 --> 00:52.864
Why is he so blase?

00:52.864 --> 00:54.831
A lot of people
are afraid of change

00:54.831 --> 00:56.564
until they're brought down
to their knees.

00:56.564 --> 00:59.531
And somehow return Fleming
to its original glory

00:59.531 --> 01:00.000
before it goes up in smoke.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.431
before it goes up in smoke.

01:01.431 --> 01:02.764
Watch out, watch out,
watch out.

01:02.764 --> 01:05.531
My gran could do better!
And she's dead!

01:05.531 --> 01:07.231
Holy.

01:07.231 --> 01:09.098
Tell the chef I surrender.

01:09.098 --> 01:11.598
That's tonight
on Kitchen Nightmares.

01:11.598 --> 01:13.664
God bless Denmark!

01:33.531 --> 01:35.431
Miami, Florida,

01:35.431 --> 01:36.664
known for
its beautiful people,

01:36.664 --> 01:38.098
sandy beaches,

01:38.098 --> 01:41.031
and Latin-inspired culture.

01:41.031 --> 01:42.898
And an ideal place
for a...

01:42.898 --> 01:44.164
Danish restaurant?

01:44.164 --> 01:47.698
What is traditional
Danish food?

01:47.698 --> 01:49.398
Yeah, a lot of people
don't understand that.

01:49.398 --> 01:51.098
Andy and his wife Suzanne

01:51.098 --> 01:52.564
purchased the successful
restaurant

01:52.564 --> 01:54.431
A taste of Denmark

01:54.431 --> 01:55.731
eight years ago.

01:55.731 --> 01:56.898
We knew it
was a good restaurant.

01:56.898 --> 01:57.998
We knew it was very popular.

01:57.998 --> 02:00.000
And the whole idea for us
was to try and keep it

02:00.000 --> 02:01.231
And the whole idea for us
was to try and keep it

02:01.231 --> 02:03.198
as much the same
as possible,

02:03.198 --> 02:05.064
so there would be
little change

02:05.064 --> 02:07.098
other than someone else
greeting them at the front door.

02:07.098 --> 02:08.764
Hi, welcome to Fleming's.
How are you?

02:08.764 --> 02:11.198
We were worried
about the fact

02:11.198 --> 02:12.898
that it said,
A taste of Denmark."

02:12.898 --> 02:15.698
'Cause neither one of us know
much about Scandinavian food.

02:15.698 --> 02:17.931
It doesn't have celery
in it, does it?

02:17.931 --> 02:20.398
And we struggled to try
and find a chef to come in,

02:20.398 --> 02:22.431
Very knowledgeable
in Danish cuisine.

02:22.431 --> 02:24.398
We finally found
something we like.

02:26.064 --> 02:29.564
Orlando is
a classically-trained chef.

02:31.564 --> 02:32.731
I'm from Cuba.

02:32.731 --> 02:33.831
On the menu right now

02:33.831 --> 02:35.831
is not 100% my cuisine.

02:37.364 --> 02:38.598
I prefer salty.

02:38.598 --> 02:40.364
Like, when, right away,
you eat your food,

02:40.364 --> 02:41.931
you feel it.
what is that?

02:41.931 --> 02:43.398
Bam!

02:43.398 --> 02:46.098
You're gonna have to start
learning how to speak Danish.

02:47.864 --> 02:50.098
I have this chef
who's got lots of ideas.

02:50.098 --> 02:52.564
You know, "Let's change this,
let's change that."

02:52.564 --> 02:54.198
But I've been
very reluctant,

02:54.198 --> 02:56.198
'cause I, you know,
I don't want to alienate

02:56.198 --> 02:58.531
our regular,
loyal customers.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.364
Follow me, ladies.

03:03.364 --> 03:05.531
Our clientele
that come to the restaurant

03:05.531 --> 03:08.098
are old people.

03:08.098 --> 03:11.998
All the servers,
they read the obituaries

03:11.998 --> 03:14.098
to see if our customers
are listed on there.

03:14.098 --> 03:15.364
After a while,
it's pretty sad

03:15.364 --> 03:17.898
when you see them sort of
knocking down like dominoes.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.564
So I haven't been here
for a while because

03:19.564 --> 03:20.998
health situations.

03:20.998 --> 03:23.598
Oh, well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

03:23.598 --> 03:24.898
And that's just sad to know

03:24.898 --> 03:28.431
these are the only people
that we serve to.

03:28.431 --> 03:29.698
If keeps going
like it's been going,

03:29.698 --> 03:30.000
this is what we got.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.731
this is what we got.

03:30.731 --> 03:32.331
15 years ago,

03:32.331 --> 03:33.931
you couldn't get in here
on a Friday or a Saturday night

03:33.931 --> 03:35.031
'cause it was booked.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.098
Now, we don't even have
reservations

03:37.098 --> 03:38.498
to fill our Friday
and Saturday nights.

03:38.498 --> 03:40.564
I think we have
to change something.

03:40.564 --> 03:42.098
We can talk
about it later.

03:42.098 --> 03:44.598
Andy has been afraid
to make changes.

03:44.598 --> 03:46.398
And why, you know,
when I tell Andy,

03:46.398 --> 03:48.031
"Well, I want to do this
and I want to do that,"

03:48.031 --> 03:49.764
and he says,
"That's not gonna fly."

03:49.764 --> 03:52.731
You can't worry just about
what the old farts think

03:52.731 --> 03:54.064
that come
into your restaurant.

03:54.064 --> 03:56.998
You got to get in
the younger people

03:56.998 --> 03:58.198
and the middle-aged people

03:58.198 --> 04:00.000
that are gonna be your clients
for the next ten years.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.564
that are gonna be your clients
for the next ten years.

04:03.064 --> 04:04.898
The huge amount of debt
that we're under right now,

04:04.898 --> 04:06.731
it puts a strain
on the restaurant,

04:06.731 --> 04:09.031
it puts a strain
on the relationship I have

04:09.031 --> 04:10.064
with--with employees.

04:10.064 --> 04:11.998
It puts a strain
on my relationship

04:11.998 --> 04:13.031
at home with Suzanne.

04:13.031 --> 04:15.064
Business sucks.
I know.

04:15.064 --> 04:18.098
We can't have many more
Saturday nights like this.

04:18.098 --> 04:20.264
Or we're not
gonna stay in business.

04:20.264 --> 04:23.198
Our restaurant
and our whole mortgage

04:23.198 --> 04:24.898
are tied into one loan.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.431
I'm concerned about
losing our house.

04:28.431 --> 04:30.000
This has been one of the most
stressful years of my life.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.998
This has been one of the most
stressful years of my life.

04:31.998 --> 04:35.098
We're at a point where
we need this restaurant

04:35.098 --> 04:37.731
to be successful soon,
or--or--

04:37.731 --> 04:40.098
we're gonna be in big trouble.

04:46.098 --> 04:47.098
People immigrate to America

04:47.098 --> 04:49.031
to chase
the great American dream.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.198
They come from Sicily

04:50.198 --> 04:51.764
to open the most amazing
Italian restaurants.

04:51.764 --> 04:53.831
From Shanghai to open
their Chinese restaurants.

04:53.831 --> 04:56.231
This is the first time I've ever
been to a Danish restaurant.

04:56.231 --> 04:57.931
Can't wait to meet
the Danish immigrants.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.964
Thank goodness
I brought my dictionary.

05:02.331 --> 05:03.431
Hi.
Hi.

05:03.431 --> 05:05.331
Good to see you.
Welcome to Fleming.

05:05.331 --> 05:06.664
Gordon, please.
And your first name is...

05:06.664 --> 05:08.764
Suzanne, and...

05:08.764 --> 05:09.831
I'm Andy.
Andy, good
to see you.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.098
You're the owners?
Yes.

05:11.098 --> 05:13.198
Okay, great.

05:14.198 --> 05:16.531
I'm sorry.

05:16.531 --> 05:17.998
No Danish here.

05:17.998 --> 05:20.164
But...
it's a Danish restaurant.

05:20.164 --> 05:21.664
The Danes
have left the building.

05:21.664 --> 05:24.164
So...
the chef's Danish.

05:24.164 --> 05:25.164
No.
No.

05:25.164 --> 05:27.031
Chef is Cuban.
He's Cuban.

05:27.031 --> 05:28.198
Cuban.

05:28.198 --> 05:30.000
And the name, Fleming's.
It means...

05:30.000 --> 05:30.698
And the name, Fleming's.
It means...

05:30.698 --> 05:32.664
Fleming is--was the original
owner of the restaurant.

05:32.664 --> 05:34.064
He's Danish?
He was Danish.

05:34.064 --> 05:35.998
So...I'm trying
to get my head around this.

05:35.998 --> 05:37.398
Danish name.

05:37.398 --> 05:38.898
What's Danish
in the restaurant?

05:38.898 --> 05:41.198
There's still
some influence in our food.

05:41.198 --> 05:44.764
And we kept everything
almost identical.

05:44.764 --> 05:47.331
Ooh, what's going on
with the color?

05:47.331 --> 05:48.431
Somebody colorblind?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.831
Yes!
Uh, yeah,
actually.

05:49.831 --> 05:51.098
I am.
You are?

05:51.098 --> 05:53.098
Yeah.
Well, you look
very well coordinated

05:53.098 --> 05:54.098
in terms
of dressing.

05:54.098 --> 05:55.931
Thank you.
I get a lot of help.

05:55.931 --> 05:57.098
Right.
And where shall I sit?

05:57.098 --> 05:58.098
I'll take you in.

06:01.998 --> 06:03.731
What do you got there?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.198
Those are our desserts.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.398
And we put them out
every day.

06:06.398 --> 06:07.998
Why would you put them out
before the customer orders them?

06:07.998 --> 06:09.198
So they can choose.

06:09.198 --> 06:10.564
So you finish your entree,

06:10.564 --> 06:12.098
and then you parade up here
to the gallery.

06:12.098 --> 06:13.998
Uh-huh.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.864
This is antiquated,
this idea.

06:15.864 --> 06:17.998
This was the way
Fleming did it.

06:17.998 --> 06:19.031
It's been kept this way.

06:19.031 --> 06:20.998
Seriously,
does that look appetizing?

06:20.998 --> 06:22.598
Adjacent to the bathroom door?

06:22.598 --> 06:23.764
They all
have to walk by it

06:23.764 --> 06:24.998
at some point
during the evening.

06:24.998 --> 06:27.998
Trust me, if I was
on my way to the bathroom,

06:27.998 --> 06:29.998
and I had to bypass that.

06:29.998 --> 06:30.000
I'd be discouraged
to come back and order dessert.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.064
I'd be discouraged
to come back and order dessert.

06:32.064 --> 06:33.731
I've got to sit down.

06:33.731 --> 06:35.331
Ay, yi, yi.
Dessert museum.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.364
Maybe when he tastes them,
things'll be better.

06:40.364 --> 06:42.064
Good evening.
How are you?

06:42.064 --> 06:43.064
Good afternoon.
How are you?

06:43.064 --> 06:44.231
I'm fine.
I'm Julie.

06:44.231 --> 06:45.764
I'll be your server.
Excellent.

06:45.764 --> 06:48.064
This is the cru d'ete
we serve with every meal.

06:48.064 --> 06:49.531
Well, I haven't
had cru d'ete,

06:49.531 --> 06:51.364
since my grandad's
80th birthday.

06:51.364 --> 06:52.498
They're old-fashioned.

06:52.498 --> 06:53.498
And how long
have you been here?

06:53.498 --> 06:54.731
I've been here 15 years.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.731
So you were
with the old owners?

06:56.731 --> 06:57.998
Yes, I was.
Wow.

06:57.998 --> 06:59.598
What's changed here
in 15 years?

06:59.598 --> 07:00.000
The staff.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.864
The staff.

07:01.864 --> 07:03.531
Wow. My God.

07:05.098 --> 07:06.364
And did the original
restaurant, Fleming's,

07:06.364 --> 07:07.564
have pink?

07:07.564 --> 07:08.998
Honestly, pink flowers,
pink napkins,

07:08.998 --> 07:09.998
pink walls.

07:09.998 --> 07:11.598
Pink everywhere.
Yeah.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.831
Oh, good grief.

07:12.831 --> 07:15.731
The pink walls
and the little blue plates.

07:15.731 --> 07:17.998
To me,
it's almost antique.

07:17.998 --> 07:21.064
It's like walking
into grandma's house.

07:21.064 --> 07:22.098
Well, say good-bye
to grandma.

07:23.531 --> 07:24.864
I think I'm ready,
actually.

07:24.864 --> 07:28.031
Let's start off
with the gravlax.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.031
Okay.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.000
Cancel that.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.031
Cancel that.

07:30.031 --> 07:31.598
Frikadelle.
Certainly.

07:31.598 --> 07:34.064
Entree, I'll go for
the grandfather duck danoise.

07:34.064 --> 07:35.764
Okay.
Excellent.

07:35.764 --> 07:37.031
Thank you, darling.

07:42.764 --> 07:45.031
I have one gravlax.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.031
One frik appetizer.

07:59.698 --> 08:00.000
Here's your gravlax.
Wow.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.264
Here's your gravlax.
Wow.

08:01.264 --> 08:03.731
Take me around the plate.

08:03.731 --> 08:04.831
Um, it's just some garnish,

08:04.831 --> 08:06.431
and then you have
the gravlax.

08:06.431 --> 08:07.831
Thank you, darling.

08:07.831 --> 08:09.998
Wow.

08:16.898 --> 08:17.998
That is hideous.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.431
It tastes like fly paper.

08:19.431 --> 08:20.731
Oh,.

08:20.731 --> 08:22.098
There's a nice fly

08:22.098 --> 08:23.531
on the side of my plate
as well.

08:23.531 --> 08:24.531
What a shame.

08:24.531 --> 08:26.931
That tasted very strange.
Way overdone.

08:26.931 --> 08:27.931
And unfortunately,
there's a fly.

08:27.931 --> 08:28.931
He's dead now, anyway.

08:28.931 --> 08:29.998
Okay.

08:29.998 --> 08:30.000
Hmm.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.064
Hmm.

08:31.064 --> 08:33.431
Oh, my God.

08:33.431 --> 08:35.198
He absolutely hated this,

08:35.198 --> 08:36.364
and there
was a bug on there.

08:36.364 --> 08:38.831
Garbage.

08:38.831 --> 08:40.564
Aggh!

08:41.764 --> 08:43.998
One frik appetizer.

08:43.998 --> 08:45.931
And this is our
homemade frikadelles.

08:45.931 --> 08:48.598
Mm-hmm. Wow.
Thank you.

08:48.598 --> 08:50.698
Frikadelle.

08:56.764 --> 08:58.764
It's just hot and mushy.

09:01.064 --> 09:03.698
Does the chef
ever season food?

09:03.698 --> 09:06.398
Everything's just got
this air of blandness.

09:06.398 --> 09:07.398
It's just like mush.

09:07.398 --> 09:08.698
It just disintegrates.

09:08.698 --> 09:09.998
That's our customers.

09:09.998 --> 09:11.031
Unbelievable.

09:11.031 --> 09:12.331
It must be a lot easier
on the dentures.

09:12.331 --> 09:13.598
Yes.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.764
Ohh.

09:17.764 --> 09:19.731
So far, not so good.

09:22.698 --> 09:23.698
My name is David.

09:23.698 --> 09:25.231
How's everything so far?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.264
Dreadful.

09:28.098 --> 09:29.531
Special for you.

09:29.531 --> 09:30.000
There's a swan
just appeared

09:30.000 --> 09:31.764
There's a swan
just appeared

09:31.764 --> 09:33.031
on that lady's table
over there--what is that?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.898
Cindee does that.

09:34.898 --> 09:36.098
What is that for, Cindee?

09:36.098 --> 09:38.831
Oh, she has
a tiramisu in it.

09:38.831 --> 09:40.364
Can I just have
a little look in there?

09:40.364 --> 09:42.731
This is from
the old days.

09:42.731 --> 09:43.931
Oh, my goodness, me.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.198
That is extraordinary,
isn't it?

09:46.198 --> 09:47.664
I'm gonna order dessert
just to get the swan.

09:48.731 --> 09:50.498
How cool is that?

09:50.498 --> 09:51.498
Enjoy.
Thanks.

09:51.498 --> 09:52.564
It's amazing.

09:52.564 --> 09:54.431
It reminds me of my
sixth birthday party

09:54.431 --> 09:56.031
with my family.

09:56.031 --> 09:57.698
You must show me
how to do that.
Okay.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.164
Oh, yes.

09:59.164 --> 10:00.000
I like to make my swans
and take them to the people

10:00.000 --> 10:01.764
I like to make my swans
and take them to the people

10:01.764 --> 10:03.164
and see their reaction.

10:03.164 --> 10:05.598
Just take a big
piece of foil.

10:05.598 --> 10:07.531
Just fold it over.
Uh-huh.

10:07.531 --> 10:09.431
Give you enough room
to have a nice, big tail.

10:09.431 --> 10:10.431
We love a big tail.

10:10.431 --> 10:12.164
More elegant.

10:12.164 --> 10:13.731
Like you.
Glamorous.

10:13.731 --> 10:15.064
Bless you.

10:15.064 --> 10:16.998
Twist it around.

10:16.998 --> 10:18.198
I love it.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.031
Make him
a pretty little head.

10:20.031 --> 10:21.031
That's just about it.

10:21.031 --> 10:22.031
Wow.

10:22.031 --> 10:23.031
Oh, and the kids love it.

10:23.031 --> 10:24.098
Ta da!

10:24.098 --> 10:25.931
This is special
for you here.

10:25.931 --> 10:28.198
Thank you very much.
My children will love it.

10:28.198 --> 10:29.264
Thank you very much.

10:29.264 --> 10:30.000
Safe trip.
Excellent.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.064
Safe trip.
Excellent.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.264
You just made their day.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.098
Well, if this
doesn't work out,

10:34.098 --> 10:35.331
I'll certainly
go to work for Chef Ramsay.

10:35.331 --> 10:38.064
I'll make all his swans.

10:40.531 --> 10:42.564
This is the duck.
Right.

10:42.564 --> 10:44.898
My goodness, me.
When was that cooked?

10:44.898 --> 10:46.264
Just now.
Really?

10:46.264 --> 10:49.164
Looks like it was roasted
a couple of days ago.

10:49.164 --> 10:50.898
Thank you.

10:58.598 --> 11:00.000
Wow, not even moist.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.064
Wow, not even moist.

11:01.064 --> 11:02.064
Ugh.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.164
Just when you think
it couldn't get any worse.

11:08.164 --> 11:09.598
I don't think that
grandpappy

11:09.598 --> 11:11.164
wanted duck
cooked like that.

11:11.164 --> 11:12.531
That's definitely
one  duck.

11:14.598 --> 11:16.064
Right now,
I don't even think

11:16.064 --> 11:17.231
a swan would cheer me up.

11:17.231 --> 11:19.898
Ohh, God.

11:23.998 --> 11:25.231
He didn't like it.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.000
Come on.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.564
Come on.

11:31.698 --> 11:34.198
Wow, 1992.

11:35.998 --> 11:37.831
Tell the chef I surrender.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.364
No more, please.

11:40.364 --> 11:41.598
God bless Denmark.

11:41.598 --> 11:43.664
God bless Denmark.

11:43.664 --> 11:44.731
We're done.

11:46.864 --> 11:48.198
Son of a bitch.

11:48.198 --> 11:49.764
What a disaster.

11:52.698 --> 11:53.598
Where's the chef?

11:53.598 --> 11:54.598
That way.

11:54.598 --> 11:55.598
Straight behind
the line.

11:57.098 --> 12:00.000
Hello.
How are you?

12:00.000 --> 12:00.098
Hello.
How are you?

12:00.098 --> 12:01.864
I'm very good.
And you're
the head chef here?

12:01.864 --> 12:03.031
Yes, sir.

12:03.031 --> 12:04.098
Why was everything
so bland?

12:05.864 --> 12:08.164
That's some of the worst
food I've ever eaten.

12:08.164 --> 12:09.498
The gravlax--
why is it so tough?

12:09.498 --> 12:11.998
I don't have
an answer for that.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.498
It was like eating
a leather belt.

12:13.498 --> 12:15.864
Frikadelle, mushy.

12:15.864 --> 12:17.764
The duck was dry.

12:17.764 --> 12:19.698
Overcooked.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.064
That was shocking.

12:21.064 --> 12:23.831
Honestly, the food
is so outdated.

12:23.831 --> 12:25.098
Why do you let him
cook that food?

12:25.098 --> 12:26.864
Because we haven't
tried to change the menu.

12:26.864 --> 12:28.364
We wan--we just--

12:28.364 --> 12:29.698
haven't tried
to change anything.

12:29.698 --> 12:30.000
Just been afraid to change.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.164
Just been afraid to change.

12:32.164 --> 12:33.331
My God.

12:33.331 --> 12:35.564
You're nostalgic
with something

12:35.564 --> 12:38.531
that's not worked
for a long time.

12:38.531 --> 12:40.898
You are at the end
of the line.

12:42.831 --> 12:44.364
hell.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.364
Coming up, something's
rotten in Denmark.

12:47.364 --> 12:49.031
It's a dinner service
from hell.

12:49.031 --> 12:50.731
Dinner's ready.

12:50.731 --> 12:52.331
Everything that is sent
out of the kitchen...

12:52.331 --> 12:53.598
I'm not gonna eat that.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.031
Comes right back
in the kitchen.

12:55.031 --> 12:56.164
What didn't he like
about this?

12:56.164 --> 12:57.198
He just said
he hated it.

12:57.198 --> 12:58.864
Oh, come on.

12:58.864 --> 12:59.931
There's a non-stop parade

12:59.931 --> 13:00.000
of food being returned
to the kitchen.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.031
of food being returned
to the kitchen.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.364
You know that.
Yes.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.531
And there's
a shocking discovery...

13:04.531 --> 13:06.198
Oh, my God.

13:06.198 --> 13:07.198
That threatens to shut down
the restaurant.

13:07.198 --> 13:08.198
Stop!

13:08.198 --> 13:09.398
Oh, God.

13:09.398 --> 13:10.831
And later,

13:10.831 --> 13:12.098
It's the most drastic
relaunch yet.

13:12.098 --> 13:15.831
Can Chef Ramsay light a fire
under this reluctant owner...

13:15.831 --> 13:18.064
My gran could do better!
And she's dead!

13:18.064 --> 13:19.998
Or is Andy and the restaurant

13:19.998 --> 13:22.431
Just impossible to save?

13:34.559 --> 13:35.792
Good evening.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.459
How are you?
Good.

13:37.459 --> 13:39.259
Word of Chef Ramsay's arrival

13:39.259 --> 13:40.725
has filled the restaurant
with customers

13:40.725 --> 13:43.092
for the first time
in five years.

13:43.092 --> 13:46.059
And so tonight,
the entire Fleming staff--

13:46.059 --> 13:47.459
owners, waiters, and cooks--

13:47.459 --> 13:49.559
will be tested.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.659
Follow me, please.

13:51.659 --> 13:54.759
I am disappointed at some of
the things that happened today.

13:54.759 --> 13:55.925
How is everything
going out here?

13:55.925 --> 13:57.740
Good, I just need to start
sitting this room now.

13:57.740 --> 13:58.159
Good, I just need to start
sitting this room now.

13:58.159 --> 13:59.892
Okay.

13:59.892 --> 14:01.625
But there's nowhere to go
but up now.

14:01.625 --> 14:05.759
And I trust Andy 100%.

14:05.759 --> 14:07.392
And I hope to God I'm right.

14:07.392 --> 14:09.725
'Cause if I'm not,
we're  out of luck.

14:10.925 --> 14:12.059
My name is Julie.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.159
I'll be your server
this evening.

14:13.159 --> 14:14.659
Gentlemen,
have you decided?

14:14.659 --> 14:16.959
We don't know.
Something Danish, obviously.

14:16.959 --> 14:18.492
The grandfather duck.

14:18.492 --> 14:19.925
I'm gonna have
the wienerschnitzel, please.

14:23.825 --> 14:25.559
I need Cindee, please.

14:25.559 --> 14:27.740
Just 30 minutes
into service,

14:27.740 --> 14:28.159
Just 30 minutes
into service,

14:28.159 --> 14:30.659
And a number of entrees
have left the kitchen.

14:30.659 --> 14:31.725
Ta da!

14:31.725 --> 14:33.659
Perfection.
That's what you got.

14:33.659 --> 14:35.625
Dinner's ready!

14:35.625 --> 14:38.559
So, clearly, speed
is not a problem at Fleming.

14:40.959 --> 14:43.725
That's pretty awful.

14:43.725 --> 14:46.892
However, satisfying
customers is.

14:46.892 --> 14:48.259
How is everything?

14:49.992 --> 14:51.559
Pardon?

14:51.559 --> 14:53.825
I'm not gonna eat that.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.392
Let me take this away.

14:55.392 --> 14:56.625
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

14:56.625 --> 14:57.559
What's wrong with that?

14:57.559 --> 14:57.740
Wienerschnitzel,
she said it was very bland.

14:57.740 --> 14:59.492
Wienerschnitzel,
she said it was very bland.

15:01.759 --> 15:03.759
Let's put it this way.
We won't be coming back.

15:06.659 --> 15:08.259
Let me take this away.

15:08.259 --> 15:09.392
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

15:09.392 --> 15:10.992
I couldn't even
look at that meat.

15:13.092 --> 15:14.825
You're bland too?
Bland, yeah.

15:17.492 --> 15:19.059
Okay, I'll let him know.

15:19.059 --> 15:20.159
53 hated this.

15:20.159 --> 15:21.625
Okay, okay.

15:21.625 --> 15:22.725
What didn't he
like about this?

15:22.725 --> 15:23.725
He just said
he hated it.

15:23.725 --> 15:25.459
Said he can't eat it.

15:25.459 --> 15:26.759
Oh, my.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.740
I'll bring you
the menu, Ma'am,

15:27.740 --> 15:27.825
I'll bring you
the menu, Ma'am,

15:27.825 --> 15:29.225
so you can choose
something else,

15:29.225 --> 15:30.659
and I'll get you
another salmon.

15:30.659 --> 15:31.659
Thank you.

15:31.659 --> 15:32.659
Thank you.

15:32.659 --> 15:34.559
Andy...
Oh, no, come on.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.759
This is mushy.

15:35.759 --> 15:37.725
Andy is absolutely
afraid of change.

15:37.725 --> 15:39.625
He's tried to keep
the tradition,

15:39.625 --> 15:41.592
and I think it's time
to move on.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.392
Son of a bitch.

15:43.392 --> 15:44.559
Oh, come on.

15:44.559 --> 15:47.325
I need some extra sauce.
The fish is too dry.

15:47.325 --> 15:49.459
What a disaster.

15:49.459 --> 15:50.592
Come on.

15:50.592 --> 15:52.759
No way, no way.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.059
Oh,.

15:54.059 --> 15:55.659
There's a non-stop
parade of food

15:55.659 --> 15:56.892
being returned
to the kitchen.

15:56.892 --> 15:57.740
You know that?
Yes.

15:57.740 --> 15:58.292
You know that?
Yes.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.259
Almost everything
coming back was bland,

16:00.259 --> 16:01.592
Doesn't taste well,
doesn't taste good.

16:01.592 --> 16:03.425
What's going on
with this?

16:03.425 --> 16:05.625
He said it was very bland,
no flavor.

16:05.625 --> 16:06.625
Three items.

16:06.625 --> 16:07.925
Wow,.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.292
Those dishes
were all danish-style.

16:10.292 --> 16:12.492
Items that have been there
for 25 years.

16:12.492 --> 16:13.959
Can I get you
something else to eat?

16:13.959 --> 16:15.625
You're just eating bread.
That's not gonna help.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.759
The chicken
was totally bland.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.292
I don't see how anything
can get worse at this point.

16:20.292 --> 16:23.592
While Andy dries to pacify
unhappy diners...

16:23.592 --> 16:25.125
I can make something
like, uh,

16:25.125 --> 16:27.292
coconut shrimp
very quickly, crab cakes.

16:27.292 --> 16:27.740
Chef Ramsay has seen enough
of the kitchen in action.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.659
Chef Ramsay has seen enough
of the kitchen in action.

16:29.659 --> 16:31.759
He's heard the complaints
about the food

16:31.759 --> 16:33.492
and knows that many
of the problems

16:33.492 --> 16:35.625
are not caused
by cooking alone...

16:35.625 --> 16:37.292
Holy mackerel.

16:37.292 --> 16:39.759
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi.

16:39.759 --> 16:42.725
But by what is lurking
in the storage unit.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.325
What the?

16:44.325 --> 16:45.625
Ohh!

16:45.625 --> 16:47.392
Mashed potatoes.

16:47.392 --> 16:48.459
Piping hot.

16:48.459 --> 16:49.825
This is unbelievable.

16:49.825 --> 16:52.559
Andy, Suzanne.
Come in here.

16:52.559 --> 16:53.592
Oh, God.

16:53.592 --> 16:56.325
Orlando, I know
you're busy there, big boy.

16:56.325 --> 16:57.740
I just need you
for 30 seconds, please.

16:57.740 --> 16:57.925
I just need you
for 30 seconds, please.

16:57.925 --> 16:59.259
Yeah, I'll be quick.
Come with me.

16:59.259 --> 17:00.925
So this
is for raw meat, yes?

17:00.925 --> 17:03.192
And here we got some...

17:03.192 --> 17:05.659
What the
is that?

17:05.659 --> 17:06.659
Oh, my God.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.059
No! Come on.

17:08.059 --> 17:09.292
Oh, my God.

17:09.292 --> 17:10.925
Oh,!

17:10.925 --> 17:12.659
There was one duck
on a tray

17:12.659 --> 17:14.725
with meat
that was thawing,

17:14.725 --> 17:16.125
and the duck
was in the meat juice.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.492
Cooked duck
and defrosting meat!

17:19.492 --> 17:21.492
Look at it there!
Who put the ducks there then?

17:21.492 --> 17:23.159
Agh,.

17:23.159 --> 17:24.459
We've been selling duck!

17:26.825 --> 17:27.740
Stop the kitchen!
Everybody!

17:27.740 --> 17:29.892
Stop the kitchen!
Everybody!

17:29.892 --> 17:31.392
I need all the ducks
off the table

17:31.392 --> 17:32.725
and stop them eating it.

17:34.259 --> 17:35.959
No, just for this evening,
no duck.

17:35.959 --> 17:37.792
Table 61 had duck.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.592
Is that the duck?
Yes.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.592
I'm so sorry.
I'll explain in two seconds.

17:41.592 --> 17:43.425
Do excuse me.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.759
It was embarrassing
to have Chef Ramsay

17:46.759 --> 17:49.759
literally take the duck
from in front of the gentleman

17:49.759 --> 17:52.125
and tell everybody,
"No duck."

17:52.125 --> 17:53.659
hell.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.425
Have you served
anybody duck?

17:58.992 --> 18:00.559
Stop!

18:00.559 --> 18:02.492
We're not serving none of that
duck out there!

18:02.492 --> 18:05.559
We just contaminated
the whole  place!

18:14.549 --> 18:15.716
Oh, my God.

18:15.716 --> 18:16.749
Oh, my God.

18:16.749 --> 18:18.682
Raw meat now,
and cooked meat.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.616
No! Come on.

18:20.616 --> 18:22.549
A frightening discovery
in the storage unit.

18:22.549 --> 18:23.882
Stop!

18:23.882 --> 18:26.249
We're not serving none of that
duck out there!

18:26.249 --> 18:29.049
We just contaminated
the whole place!

18:29.049 --> 18:31.182
Has clearly shown Chef Ramsay
just how far

18:31.182 --> 18:33.716
This once-legendary
restaurant has fallen.

18:33.716 --> 18:36.449
Now I am seriously,
seriously worried.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.882
We're.

18:37.882 --> 18:39.216
Yeah, you're right,
you're.

18:39.216 --> 18:40.949
If I was
a health inspector now,

18:40.949 --> 18:41.057
what would he do?

18:41.057 --> 18:43.116
what would he do?

18:43.116 --> 18:44.916
He would take that product
and probably throw it out.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.549
Throw it out?

18:46.549 --> 18:48.382
You wouldn't
continue serving

18:48.382 --> 18:49.682
one more plate of food.

18:49.682 --> 18:51.216
What do you think
we're gonna do,

18:51.216 --> 18:52.516
continue cooking?

18:52.516 --> 18:54.449
I don't believe that the food
that's out here now

18:54.449 --> 18:56.582
is contaminated in--
You don't believe?

18:56.582 --> 18:59.682
I never have
seen that before.

18:59.682 --> 19:01.216
If I did,
I would have a fit.

19:01.216 --> 19:04.182
But I was surprised
that Andy wasn't aware of that.

19:04.182 --> 19:05.616
I think he's had his head
buried in the sand

19:05.616 --> 19:06.716
for last seven years.

19:06.716 --> 19:09.349
You cook one more thing,

19:09.349 --> 19:11.057
I'm  out of here!

19:11.057 --> 19:11.249
I'm  out of here!

19:11.249 --> 19:12.516
There are blinders at times.

19:12.516 --> 19:13.616
When things get tough,

19:13.616 --> 19:15.549
I put 'em on,
and I just forge ahead.

19:15.549 --> 19:16.716
And you miss some things,

19:16.716 --> 19:19.249
and we miss
some of those.

19:19.249 --> 19:22.549
Chef Ramsay is frustrated
by Andy's laidback attitude,

19:22.549 --> 19:24.682
So he decides to try
and get some answers

19:24.682 --> 19:27.249
from Andy's wife Suzanne.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.216
I don't know
where to start.

19:30.216 --> 19:32.049
Okay.

19:32.049 --> 19:33.449
I don't know
what to tell you.

19:33.449 --> 19:35.682
All I can say
is I'm sorry.

19:35.682 --> 19:38.049
Trying to work with
an owner that's in denial

19:38.049 --> 19:39.849
is ten times harder.

19:39.849 --> 19:41.057
Why is he so blase?

19:41.057 --> 19:41.782
Why is he so blase?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.016
I think
he's probably in shock.

19:45.016 --> 19:46.249
I don't know, I'm not him,

19:46.249 --> 19:47.616
so I don't know
what he's doing right now.

19:50.582 --> 19:52.449
Suzanne, if your husband

19:52.449 --> 19:56.049
Doesn't start realizing
what he's doing wrong

19:56.049 --> 19:58.716
in a big way,

19:58.716 --> 19:59.882
I can't help it.

19:59.882 --> 20:01.216
I agree.

20:01.216 --> 20:02.582
I agree.

20:02.582 --> 20:04.416
I feel let down by Andy.

20:04.416 --> 20:08.082
This is a huge,
huge wakeup call.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.516
And if this doesn't
make any change,

20:09.516 --> 20:10.582
nothing will.

20:10.582 --> 20:11.057
I don't know
where to start, Suzanne.

20:11.057 --> 20:14.416
I don't know
where to start, Suzanne.

20:14.416 --> 20:15.916
What I do know is that,
right now,

20:15.916 --> 20:17.916
I don't feel too good
about this one.

20:31.582 --> 20:33.616
A dramatic change
in the weather.

20:33.616 --> 20:35.282
That's exactly
what Fleming's needs.

20:35.282 --> 20:36.616
A big, dramatic change.

20:36.616 --> 20:38.116
So I'm gonna hit the streets
and find out

20:38.116 --> 20:39.449
what the locals
really want

20:39.449 --> 20:41.057
from their
Fleming's restaurant.

20:41.057 --> 20:41.249
from their
Fleming's restaurant.

20:41.249 --> 20:42.516
Hello!

20:42.516 --> 20:44.582
Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you guys.

20:44.582 --> 20:45.882
Now, ladies,
have you heard of Fleming's?

20:45.882 --> 20:47.449
Yeah.
Of course.

20:47.449 --> 20:48.616
Nobody talks about it
anymore.

20:48.616 --> 20:49.616
Nobody says,
"Oh, I was at Fleming's.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.916
Let's go back
and try it out."

20:50.916 --> 20:52.716
There's a new owner,
and it went downhill.

20:52.716 --> 20:53.616
Have you heard
of Fleming's restaurant?

20:53.616 --> 20:54.682
Actually, I have.

20:54.682 --> 20:55.949
What's the word
on the street?

20:55.949 --> 20:57.682
Not-so-good food.

20:57.682 --> 20:59.582
My parents
used to go there,

20:59.582 --> 21:01.349
back in the day,
when it was good,

21:01.349 --> 21:02.749
but I didn't even know
it was still open.

21:02.749 --> 21:04.616
Uh, I haven't
heard any good reviews.

21:04.616 --> 21:06.282
It's old.
Yeah.

21:06.282 --> 21:07.582
It's a--it's a place
my mom and dad

21:07.582 --> 21:08.949
would probably love to go.

21:08.949 --> 21:11.057
And you're not gonna go
anywhere near the place again?

21:11.057 --> 21:11.116
And you're not gonna go
anywhere near the place again?

21:11.116 --> 21:12.682
Not until something's done.

21:12.682 --> 21:13.582
It's extraordinary.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.282
And this guy's
adverse to change?

21:15.282 --> 21:16.382
When you got
all those customers

21:16.382 --> 21:18.616
standing on your doorstep...

21:18.616 --> 21:20.582
Unbelievable.
So sad.

21:25.015 --> 21:26.849
Chef Ramsay's
grassroots research

21:26.849 --> 21:28.782
Clearly points out
how damaged

21:28.782 --> 21:31.015
this restaurant's reputation
really is.

21:31.015 --> 21:33.415
Ironically, man of the people
who work at Fleming

21:33.415 --> 21:37.182
realized they are
in desperate need of change.

21:37.182 --> 21:39.882
But there is one person
who doesn't agree with that.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.057
Unfortunately,
it's the owner.

21:41.057 --> 21:41.849
Unfortunately,
it's the owner.

21:41.849 --> 21:43.915
Yesterday was a really bad day.

21:43.915 --> 21:45.282
I took the morning
this morning,

21:45.282 --> 21:46.749
walked around the community,
done my homework.

21:46.749 --> 21:49.515
And really confirmed...

21:49.515 --> 21:53.949
This Danish restaurant
is no longer talk of the town.

21:53.949 --> 21:55.415
So what I need

21:55.415 --> 21:57.415
from each and every
one of you

21:57.415 --> 21:59.515
is to be incredibly honest.

21:59.515 --> 22:01.549
Let's talk about what's wrong
with the restaurant.

22:01.549 --> 22:05.582
Orlando, tell Andy
what this place needs.

22:05.582 --> 22:09.182
I believe we need to--
brilliant new menu.

22:09.182 --> 22:10.715
We need to bring in
new food.

22:10.715 --> 22:11.057
Something more attractive,
something more...

22:11.057 --> 22:13.349
Something more attractive,
something more...

22:13.349 --> 22:15.182
Contemporary, you know?

22:15.182 --> 22:17.515
That's my opinion right now.

22:17.515 --> 22:19.382
Crystal, tell Andy

22:19.382 --> 22:21.515
why the restaurant's
not working.

22:21.515 --> 22:24.382
You're scared
you're gonna fail.

22:24.382 --> 22:27.015
So instead of taking
the jump and the leap

22:27.015 --> 22:29.182
of actually doing
what you want to do,

22:29.182 --> 22:32.249
you're scared
that no one's gonna like it

22:32.249 --> 22:34.049
and you're gonna
lose everything.

22:34.049 --> 22:35.682
But the truth
of the matter is, Andy,

22:35.682 --> 22:37.449
either way,
you're gonna lose it

22:37.449 --> 22:39.382
if you don't do something.

22:39.382 --> 22:40.882
Suzanne,

22:40.882 --> 22:41.057
you and I spent time
talking last night

22:41.057 --> 22:43.449
you and I spent time
talking last night

22:43.449 --> 22:44.915
where you were pissed off.

22:44.915 --> 22:46.549
Tell your husband

22:46.549 --> 22:48.515
what he needs to do
to get this place

22:48.515 --> 22:50.382
back on track.

22:50.382 --> 22:51.415
In my opinion,

22:51.415 --> 22:53.349
I think a lot of people

22:53.349 --> 22:54.549
are afraid of change.

22:54.549 --> 22:55.882
And they don't change

22:55.882 --> 22:57.715
until they're brought
down to their knees.

22:57.715 --> 22:58.782
'Cause they're terrified,

22:58.782 --> 22:59.949
because it's easier

22:59.949 --> 23:02.115
to stay with
what they know

23:02.115 --> 23:03.515
than to risk change.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.382
And I think that
has been Andy's fault.

23:06.382 --> 23:08.349
Do you understand
what she's saying?

23:08.349 --> 23:10.515
Yeah, I--
her points are valid, my--

23:10.515 --> 23:11.057
How do you respond to it?
how--

23:11.057 --> 23:12.515
How do you respond to it?
how--

23:12.515 --> 23:14.715
My response to it now is

23:14.715 --> 23:17.049
I'm just afraid to alienate
the people that we have

23:17.049 --> 23:18.749
and lose what we have.

23:18.749 --> 23:20.949
The only thing right now

23:20.949 --> 23:23.915
that's gonna
save your business

23:23.915 --> 23:26.282
is a dramatic change.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.615
It--it's
a long time coming,

23:30.615 --> 23:33.282
and it's--
it's time to do it.

23:33.282 --> 23:36.082
Andy needs to take
ownership of the restaurant,

23:36.082 --> 23:38.449
And I think Andy
will buck up now

23:38.449 --> 23:39.482
and take charge.

23:39.482 --> 23:40.949
Get ready...

23:40.949 --> 23:41.057
For a dramatic change.

23:41.057 --> 23:43.249
For a dramatic change.

23:43.249 --> 23:46.282
Coming up,
Gordon does what he can

23:46.282 --> 23:47.515
to spread the word
about the new Fleming.

23:47.515 --> 23:48.649
Step on it, big boy.

23:48.649 --> 23:50.315
It's about
the standards, yes?

23:50.315 --> 23:51.749
But he may have
been better off

23:51.749 --> 23:53.482
Keeping it a secret.

23:53.482 --> 23:55.115
Forget anything to do
with Danish.

23:55.115 --> 23:57.749
Danish food may be
a thing of the past...

23:57.749 --> 23:59.649
He's making Caesars
with vegetables.

23:59.649 --> 24:01.282
He's what?

24:01.282 --> 24:03.849
But some of the old problems
still remain.

24:03.849 --> 24:06.515
It's a relaunch night
teetering on disaster.

24:06.515 --> 24:07.615
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

24:07.615 --> 24:09.315
Water, water, water.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.057
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

24:11.057 --> 24:12.915
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

24:19.218 --> 24:21.751
Chef Ramsay knows
that the changes to Fleming

24:21.751 --> 24:23.385
cannot be subtle.

24:23.385 --> 24:26.318
And the most drastic change
needs to be the food.

24:26.318 --> 24:27.718
So step one of his plan

24:27.718 --> 24:30.085
is to take the restrictions
off the kitchen staff

24:30.085 --> 24:31.484
and let them cook.

24:31.484 --> 24:33.251
I want to spend
the next 20 minutes

24:33.251 --> 24:35.018
looking at the ingredients
that we've got

24:35.018 --> 24:36.018
and just cooking something.

24:36.018 --> 24:37.484
And when you start,

24:37.484 --> 24:39.751
forget anything to do
with Danish.

24:39.751 --> 24:42.218
People don't go out
in South Florida

24:42.218 --> 24:43.151
to dine Danish.

24:43.151 --> 24:44.186
Let's get that right.
Yeah?

24:44.186 --> 24:45.151
Let's get that right.
Yeah?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.184
Okay.
Think popular,

24:46.184 --> 24:48.651
think trend,
and think where we are.

24:48.651 --> 24:49.818
Okay.
Let's do some cooking.

24:49.818 --> 24:51.684
Four of us together, yeah?

24:54.651 --> 24:55.751
I want to see
a little bit of flair.

24:55.751 --> 24:57.351
Oh, yeah, baby.

24:57.351 --> 24:58.418
That's gonna be awesome.

24:58.418 --> 24:59.418
Something different.

24:59.418 --> 25:00.851
Yeah!

25:00.851 --> 25:02.218
That's like
what we're looking for.

25:02.218 --> 25:03.384
That's like--
we ready for that.

25:03.384 --> 25:04.984
That tuna
looks beautiful.

25:04.984 --> 25:06.351
Doesn't it?
Melts in your mouth.

25:06.351 --> 25:08.084
Let's go. Ready?

25:08.084 --> 25:10.984
With the shackles taken off,

25:10.984 --> 25:13.151
the kitchen have come up
with a number of exciting,

25:13.151 --> 25:14.186
non-Danish menu items.

25:14.186 --> 25:14.418
non-Danish menu items.

25:14.418 --> 25:16.051
That's definitely
not our menu.

25:16.051 --> 25:19.018
Chef Ramsay has added
a seared tuna.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.918
Now, to make sure everyone
is on the same page,

25:21.918 --> 25:22.918
he shares these new dishes

25:22.918 --> 25:24.651
with the front
of the house staff.

25:24.651 --> 25:25.584
Scrumptious.

25:25.584 --> 25:26.818
Excellent.

25:26.818 --> 25:27.918
Nothing Danish there.

25:27.918 --> 25:29.484
Taste the chips.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.318
They've been seasoned with
a little bit of cayenne pepper.

25:31.318 --> 25:32.318
Black beans,

25:32.318 --> 25:34.151
pineapple salsa.
Yeah?

25:34.151 --> 25:35.851
This is so good.

25:35.851 --> 25:37.184
And I love this.

25:37.184 --> 25:39.351
Seeing those dishes
and tasting them,

25:39.351 --> 25:41.318
it's a better reflection
of what Miami is.

25:41.318 --> 25:44.186
And I think
it'll draw in a big crowd.

25:44.186 --> 25:45.051
And I think
it'll draw in a big crowd.

25:45.051 --> 25:46.718
Very nice.
Very nice.

25:46.718 --> 25:48.918
I think change is difficult
for everybody.

25:48.918 --> 25:51.884
What we've been doing
for the same 25 years

25:51.884 --> 25:53.084
is not working anymore.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.751
We're gonna get
this restaurant on track.

26:02.584 --> 26:04.851
With Chef Ramsay's newfound
belief in the kitchen staff

26:04.851 --> 26:06.084
and Andy,

26:06.084 --> 26:07.918
Gordon and his team
worked through the night

26:07.918 --> 26:10.584
to pull off one of the most
ambitious makeovers yet.

26:12.518 --> 26:13.551
Good morning.

26:13.551 --> 26:14.186
Good morning.

26:14.186 --> 26:14.884
Good morning.

26:14.884 --> 26:15.984
Come through, please.

26:15.984 --> 26:18.018
All right.

26:18.018 --> 26:20.151
Today is about
dramatic changes.

26:20.151 --> 26:22.151
Andy and Suzanne,
are you ready?

26:22.151 --> 26:23.151
Absolutely.

26:23.151 --> 26:24.384
Good, let's go.

26:24.384 --> 26:26.884
It's time to enter
the new Fleming.

26:26.884 --> 26:28.218
And more importantly,
time to start

26:28.218 --> 26:31.151
a new, profitable chapter.

26:31.151 --> 26:33.218
Holy.
Come in.

26:33.218 --> 26:35.918
Oh, my God.

26:35.918 --> 26:37.351
Wow.

26:37.351 --> 26:39.218
Oh, my God.

26:39.218 --> 26:40.184
Holy cow!

26:40.184 --> 26:41.184
Can you believe this?

26:41.184 --> 26:42.751
Oh, my God.

26:42.751 --> 26:44.186
This is magic.

26:44.186 --> 26:44.584
This is magic.

26:44.584 --> 26:46.651
Got rid of that pink
that scares

26:46.651 --> 26:48.151
And spooks customers away.

26:48.151 --> 26:50.418
It was dated and uninviting.

26:50.418 --> 26:53.651
Now it's warm, it's elegant.

26:53.651 --> 26:55.884
It brings in a new,
modern era.

26:55.884 --> 26:58.418
I am so excited
for Andy and Suzanne.

26:58.418 --> 27:01.084
It's the direction that
we've been wanting to go.

27:01.084 --> 27:03.484
And now we can take those
baby steps to do that.

27:03.484 --> 27:06.318
Because we can't go back
to being the old Fleming's.

27:06.318 --> 27:08.851
This color is gorgeous.

27:08.851 --> 27:10.318
Andy, what color is it?

27:10.318 --> 27:11.418
I'm not sure.

27:11.418 --> 27:13.218
You're not sure.
Okay.

27:13.218 --> 27:14.186
But it looks great.

27:14.186 --> 27:14.384
But it looks great.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.351
It's a Tudor brown.

27:16.351 --> 27:18.184
We've got some new art
on the walls,

27:18.184 --> 27:19.218
and look at the lights.

27:19.218 --> 27:20.384
They make the brown
stand out.

27:20.384 --> 27:22.084
And have a look at this.

27:22.084 --> 27:23.351
Oh, look at that!

27:23.351 --> 27:25.818
Whoo, I'm...
I can't talk.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.918
This is no longer
Johansen Fleming's restaurant.

27:28.918 --> 27:31.651
Birds of flight.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.751
Taking off into
new chapters.

27:33.751 --> 27:34.818
A new beginning.

27:34.818 --> 27:37.351
I love it.
I'm extremely happy.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.384
It's gorgeous.

27:38.384 --> 27:41.084
To see Andy and Suzanne

27:41.084 --> 27:43.218
crying for happy...

27:43.218 --> 27:44.186
It...haven't seen that
in a long time.

27:44.186 --> 27:46.418
It...haven't seen that
in a long time.

27:46.418 --> 27:48.184
Nothing but grim faces.

27:48.184 --> 27:49.918
Nothing but despair.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.651
And this is not despair.
This is awesome.

27:52.651 --> 27:53.884
I want to just bust.

27:53.884 --> 27:55.318
Amazing.

27:55.318 --> 27:56.984
I don't cry very often.

27:56.984 --> 27:59.318
I can't tell you
the last time.

27:59.318 --> 28:00.751
But this did it.

28:00.751 --> 28:04.184
This is, um,
everything for us.

28:04.184 --> 28:05.151
Gives us new hope.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.051
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

28:07.051 --> 28:08.051
I'm good.

28:08.051 --> 28:09.318
I'm crazy.

28:09.318 --> 28:10.584
I'm so happy
for you two.

28:10.584 --> 28:11.684
Unbelievable.

28:11.684 --> 28:13.051
To see my husband

28:13.051 --> 28:14.186
cry with happiness,

28:14.186 --> 28:14.551
cry with happiness,

28:14.551 --> 28:17.318
to me, that was
the biggest gift of all.

28:17.318 --> 28:19.218
I've never seen him
so happy.

28:19.218 --> 28:21.251
It's been a huge
wakeup call for him.

28:21.251 --> 28:22.651
Now we have a restaurant
to be proud of

28:22.651 --> 28:25.717
to take us right into
the 21st century.

28:25.717 --> 28:26.751
Andy, embrace it.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.051
Really convict it.

28:28.051 --> 28:29.151
Make it yours.

28:29.151 --> 28:31.084
It will happen.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.317
With the change in decor
now complete,

28:33.317 --> 28:36.017
Chef Ramsay's next step
in turning around the business

28:36.017 --> 28:38.584
is to market the restaurant
to a younger clientele.

28:41.417 --> 28:44.184
So he reaches out
to two local designers

28:44.184 --> 28:44.186
and puts together
a swimsuit fashion show.

28:44.186 --> 28:46.717
and puts together
a swimsuit fashion show.

28:46.717 --> 28:48.017
Oh, wow.

28:49.751 --> 28:51.717
The fashion show was fabulous.

28:51.717 --> 28:53.917
I was amazed.

28:53.917 --> 28:54.984
It was good
to see younger faces

28:54.984 --> 28:56.717
that we want to attract
to the restaurant.

28:56.717 --> 28:58.184
People are very excited.

28:58.184 --> 28:59.751
Our phones will probably be
ringing off the hook.

28:59.751 --> 29:01.651
Although the main objective
of the fashion show

29:01.651 --> 29:04.151
was to spread the word
about the new Fleming,

29:04.151 --> 29:05.417
Chef Ramsay
had a secret mission

29:05.417 --> 29:06.984
that he wanted to reveal.

29:06.984 --> 29:08.017
Weren't they amazing?

29:08.017 --> 29:10.051
Yes.
Absolutely.

29:10.051 --> 29:12.017
For the grand finale,
please welcome

29:12.017 --> 29:13.384
our male model.

29:17.084 --> 29:19.217
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:19.217 --> 29:20.684
It's Andy,

29:20.684 --> 29:23.151
the owner
of Fleming's restaurant.

29:23.151 --> 29:24.351
I was in shock,

29:24.351 --> 29:27.084
because I didn't really
quite recognize him.

29:27.084 --> 29:29.151
There's more than
a breath of fresh air.

29:29.151 --> 29:30.817
There's a whole hurricane.

29:30.817 --> 29:32.017
Suzanne.
Yeah?

29:32.017 --> 29:33.684
Ten years younger.

29:33.684 --> 29:34.684
Yes.

29:34.684 --> 29:36.017
You look great, honey.

29:36.017 --> 29:37.717
The clothes were amazing.

29:37.717 --> 29:39.151
The haircut was amazing.

29:39.151 --> 29:41.184
Most importantly,
he was smiling.

29:41.184 --> 29:42.317
How can you not
be motivated?

29:42.317 --> 29:43.884
Give it up, buddy.
Well done, yes?

29:43.884 --> 29:44.186
You look great.
I feel good.

29:44.186 --> 29:45.251
You look great.
I feel good.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.351
I'm ready to go.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.651
You gotta come
see this new restaurant.

29:47.651 --> 29:48.751
It is unbelievable.

29:50.484 --> 29:51.551
Very good!

29:53.651 --> 29:56.384
Coming up on
Kitchen Nightmares...

29:56.384 --> 29:58.684
Something's burning, Bobby.
I smell something burning.

29:58.684 --> 29:59.817
Will a dangerous fire...

29:59.817 --> 30:01.717
Water, water, water.
No, no, no.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.217
Derail Andy's hopes
for a successful relaunch?

30:04.217 --> 30:05.517
Watch out,watch out,
watch out.

30:05.517 --> 30:06.817
Clear the way.
Let's go!

30:06.817 --> 30:08.184
Holy crap.

30:15.826 --> 30:17.126
It's hours before relaunch,

30:17.126 --> 30:18.893
and with
the dining room makeover

30:18.893 --> 30:20.660
and owner makeover
now complete...

30:20.660 --> 30:22.260
Okay, Orlando,
let's go, buddy.

30:22.260 --> 30:23.793
Chef Ramsay is ready
to unveil

30:23.793 --> 30:25.293
The new Fleming menu.

30:25.293 --> 30:27.160
Gone are the Danish gravlax.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.160
The frikadelle.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.660
And the grandfather duck.

30:30.660 --> 30:33.926
And in its place,
a modern, contemporary menu

30:33.926 --> 30:36.260
ideally suited
for South Miami.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.326
Right, start off
with the crab cakes.

30:38.326 --> 30:39.460
Give it a modern twist.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.160
The rock shrimp
lettuce cups.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.344
Pan seared grouper fillet.

30:42.344 --> 30:42.726
Pan seared grouper fillet.

30:42.726 --> 30:44.893
Seasoned with chorizo,
so it's a little bit spicy.

30:44.893 --> 30:46.260
Playing on the Cuban
influence,

30:46.260 --> 30:47.060
because the chef
is Cuban and,

30:47.060 --> 30:49.660
more importantly,
nice contrast, yeah?

30:58.093 --> 30:59.893
Look at the portion size.

30:59.893 --> 31:01.926
What I want to see tonight,
more than anything,

31:01.926 --> 31:02.926
is empty plates.

31:02.926 --> 31:04.893
Because,
when desserts come,

31:04.893 --> 31:06.093
we're gonna do this.

31:06.093 --> 31:07.260
Very, very simple.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.260
Ah, yeah.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.460
Yeah, to the table.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.344
Now...
Yes, yes.

31:12.344 --> 31:12.793
Now...
Yes, yes.

31:12.793 --> 31:15.126
It looks so inviting.

31:15.126 --> 31:16.726
It's modern,
contemporary,

31:16.726 --> 31:18.226
and it's just
an immaculate way

31:18.226 --> 31:19.493
of serving a dessert.

31:19.493 --> 31:22.260
We don't stand
and hold on to nostalgia.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.293
We move on.

31:23.293 --> 31:24.493
Andy, how does it look?

31:24.493 --> 31:26.260
It looks fabulous, Chef.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.626
Now there's no excuse.

31:27.626 --> 31:29.826
Have a little taste, yeah?

31:29.826 --> 31:31.893
We're opening in just
under an hour, guys, yeah?

31:31.893 --> 31:33.326
Mmm!

31:33.326 --> 31:35.126
That is good.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.460
That is, whew,
out of this world.

31:36.460 --> 31:37.926
The menu is fantastic,

31:37.926 --> 31:39.060
the food tasted out great.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.126
Everything looked wonderful.
Unbelievable.

31:41.126 --> 31:42.344
I didn't see
any Danish food anywhere.

31:42.344 --> 31:42.760
I didn't see
any Danish food anywhere.

31:46.793 --> 31:48.726
Fleming has gone through
some major changes

31:48.726 --> 31:50.126
in the last 72 hours.

31:50.126 --> 31:51.726
It appears as though
the biggest change

31:51.726 --> 31:53.226
may have been
the owner, Andy.

31:53.226 --> 31:56.126
Okay, 74, 75,
77, 78.

31:56.126 --> 31:57.260
No 76, okay?

31:57.260 --> 31:58.293
Who has a newfound energy

31:58.293 --> 32:01.093
And is operating
like the leader he once was.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.493
Let's go.
We gotta roll.

32:02.493 --> 32:04.226
Chef Ramsay definitely
put a fire under Andy.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.593
You should have
everything out there

32:05.593 --> 32:08.460
he was sent down
special from heaven.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.660
I--I know he is.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.126
Tonight, relaunch night.

32:11.126 --> 32:12.344
Yes, it's gonna
be different,

32:12.344 --> 32:12.760
Yes, it's gonna
be different,

32:12.760 --> 32:13.826
but stick together.

32:13.826 --> 32:15.060
We're not
throwing food out.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.426
We're caring,
seasoning,

32:16.426 --> 32:17.560
and hitting perfection.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.160
Okay?
Yes, sir.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.093
Let's go.

32:20.093 --> 32:23.160
I'm feeling nervous,
excited, tense.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.093
Everything,
everything all at once.

32:25.093 --> 32:27.493
Crystal, daequon cook
from the Miami heat...

32:27.493 --> 32:28.626
Yes?
Is coming for dinner.

32:28.626 --> 32:29.660
Okay.
Okay?

32:29.660 --> 32:32.093
So look after him, yeah?

32:32.093 --> 32:34.126
Hi, welcome to Fleming's.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.560
The fashion show

32:35.560 --> 32:37.093
clearly has spread the word
about Fleming.

32:37.093 --> 32:38.326
This is our new menu.

32:38.326 --> 32:39.893
I like the look.

32:39.893 --> 32:41.826
It's very clean,
and it's refreshing.

32:41.826 --> 32:42.344
I'm very excited.
Enjoy dinner.
Thanks.

32:42.344 --> 32:43.926
I'm very excited.
Enjoy dinner.
Thanks.

32:43.926 --> 32:45.626
The restaurant
is fully booked.

32:45.626 --> 32:47.793
My name's Crystal.
Daequon.

32:47.793 --> 32:48.826
Ah, I know who you are.

32:48.826 --> 32:51.626
Okay.
It's nice to meet you.

32:51.626 --> 32:52.660
Are you ready to order?

32:59.126 --> 33:00.160
Yes, Ma'am.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.493
Appreciate it.

33:06.493 --> 33:08.260
Cheers.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.493
First table, yes?

33:09.493 --> 33:12.260
Two small Caesar salads.
Snap on it, big boy.

33:12.260 --> 33:12.344
As part of the new menu,

33:12.344 --> 33:14.126
As part of the new menu,

33:14.126 --> 33:16.260
All of the entrees come
with either a house salad,

33:16.260 --> 33:17.660
a wedge salad,

33:17.660 --> 33:19.126
or a Caesar salad.

33:19.126 --> 33:20.926
15 minutes into service,

33:20.926 --> 33:23.593
and the salads
are leaving the kitchen.

33:28.226 --> 33:30.260
Rich, you gotta be quicker
with those Caesar salads.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.226
Are our Caesars
coming with croutons,

33:32.226 --> 33:33.660
or are they coming
with vegetables?

33:33.660 --> 33:34.993
Vegetables?

33:34.993 --> 33:36.560
He's making Caesars
with vegetables.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.260
He's what?

33:38.260 --> 33:39.460
That's what
I'm asking him,

33:39.460 --> 33:41.226
trying to say--
that's not a Caesar.

33:41.226 --> 33:42.260
Oh, my God.

33:44.493 --> 33:45.826
I'm so sorry.

33:45.826 --> 33:47.260
Is there carrots
in your Caesar salad?

33:47.260 --> 33:49.260
I think so.
Yeah, would you excuse me?

33:49.260 --> 33:50.893
Would you mind if I just get
a chance to do them again?

33:50.893 --> 33:51.893
I'm so sorry.
Sure.

33:51.893 --> 33:53.560
And--and my apologies.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.993
Hey, guys.

33:54.993 --> 33:56.493
Orlando, just two seconds.

33:56.493 --> 33:57.826
You, stop.

33:57.826 --> 33:59.093
Look at me.

33:59.093 --> 34:01.160
We're not serving
Caesar salad

34:01.160 --> 34:02.660
with bits of carrot
in there.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.593
The Caesar salad
hasn't changed!

34:04.593 --> 34:06.793
Come on, guys.
Radish?

34:06.793 --> 34:08.293
Caesar salad?

34:08.293 --> 34:10.326
The only thing that's missing
is the  flies!

34:10.326 --> 34:12.326
Nerves are high.

34:12.326 --> 34:12.344
And there's a lot
of confusion back there.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.126
And there's a lot
of confusion back there.

34:14.126 --> 34:15.893
A lot of confusion in
the salad area tonight.

34:15.893 --> 34:17.326
You have to watch
what he's doing.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.426
Complicated?
What?

34:22.426 --> 34:24.660
My gran could do better!

34:24.660 --> 34:26.660
And she's dead!

34:26.660 --> 34:28.226
Oh, my God.

34:28.226 --> 34:30.226
We can't even get
out of the trap properly.

34:30.226 --> 34:32.060
The cold food
is backing up the kitchen,

34:32.060 --> 34:33.993
and this, right now,
doesn't look good.

34:33.993 --> 34:35.393
hell.

34:35.393 --> 34:37.760
It's 40 minutes
into service,

34:37.760 --> 34:40.560
And not one proper salad
has left the kitchen.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.226
Can you help,
please, yes?

34:42.226 --> 34:42.344
And, not surprisingly,

34:42.344 --> 34:43.660
And, not surprisingly,

34:43.660 --> 34:46.126
Customers' patience
is wearing thin.

34:51.226 --> 34:52.826
The kitchen is totally
backed up.

34:52.826 --> 34:54.060
I can't even get
a Caesar salad.

34:54.060 --> 34:56.060
Caesar salad is the simplest
things to do.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.993
You just put a little
lettuce in, you know?

34:57.993 --> 34:59.426
It's like, God.

34:59.426 --> 35:01.260
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.326
Unbelievable.

35:02.326 --> 35:05.093
I asked for five
Caesar salads,

35:05.093 --> 35:06.626
like half an hour ago.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.560
Where the
are they?

35:08.560 --> 35:10.926
Do I have to make it myself?
I'll make it myself, yeah?

35:12.393 --> 35:13.593
A Caesar  salad.

35:13.593 --> 35:15.160
We're dying over here.
Come on.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.626
Hallelujah!
I got my Caesars.

35:17.626 --> 35:20.160
Okay, here
is the Caesar salad.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.326
The kitchen has recovered
from the salad dilemma.

35:22.326 --> 35:24.060
Beautiful.
Let's get these going.

35:24.060 --> 35:25.393
And an hour into service,

35:25.393 --> 35:27.560
entrees are making their way
to the dining room.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.160
And relaunch looks
to be back on track.

35:31.626 --> 35:33.260
Oh, my God, it's not working.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.093
But the old equipment
at the restaurant

35:35.093 --> 35:37.226
has brought the kitchen
to a standstill.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.126
No, no, no,
try to put it on the pilot.

35:41.126 --> 35:42.060
Guys, come on!

35:42.060 --> 35:42.344
Un--believable.

35:42.344 --> 35:43.326
Un--believable.

35:43.326 --> 35:45.093
If you're without
the right equipment

35:45.093 --> 35:47.260
with that kind of business
at the same time,

35:47.260 --> 35:48.326
we can't respond.

35:48.326 --> 35:49.393
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

35:49.393 --> 35:50.493
All right.

35:50.493 --> 35:51.593
How can you work
with a range

35:51.593 --> 35:52.993
that half of it
doesn't work?

35:52.993 --> 35:54.093
Unbelievable.

35:54.093 --> 35:55.593
We can't get
a  meal out of here.

35:55.593 --> 35:56.593
Let's go!

35:59.093 --> 36:01.293
This relaunch,
we have to make it work.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.593
We don't have time
to have another bad night.

36:03.593 --> 36:04.993
But we don't have
what we need back there to--

36:04.993 --> 36:08.493
to really
pull this off 100%.

36:08.493 --> 36:11.426
While Chef Ramsay
goes to the dining room

36:11.426 --> 36:12.344
to see how customers
are doing,

36:12.344 --> 36:13.093
to see how customers
are doing,

36:13.093 --> 36:16.126
the chefs continue
to tinker with faulty equipment,

36:16.126 --> 36:17.926
unaware that
they're about to cause

36:17.926 --> 36:20.460
a much bigger problem.

36:20.460 --> 36:23.093
Something's burning, Bobby.
I smell something burning.

36:23.093 --> 36:24.393
Where do you smell that?

36:24.393 --> 36:25.460
Smell it?

36:25.460 --> 36:27.060
Something is burning.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.226
Something is burning
over here.

36:29.226 --> 36:30.893
What is burning?
Bread burning?

36:30.893 --> 36:32.760
No, it's more than bread.
Something else is burning.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.260
Something is burning.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.393
I smell something burning.
Something is burning.

36:37.393 --> 36:38.826
Water, water,
water, water.

36:38.826 --> 36:40.760
No, no, no.
Watch out, watch out.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.260
Clear the way.
Clear the way.

36:42.260 --> 36:42.344
Let's go.
Move in, guys.

36:42.344 --> 36:43.326
Let's go.
Move in, guys.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.060
Move the pan.
Move the pan.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.660
Hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry...Andy.

36:46.660 --> 36:47.926
Move it, move it, move it.

36:57.086 --> 36:59.752
Within minutes of Chef Ramsay
leaving the kitchen

36:59.752 --> 37:00.819
to check on
the dining room...

37:00.819 --> 37:02.152
Something is burning
over here.

37:02.152 --> 37:04.186
A stovetop fire has erupted,

37:04.186 --> 37:07.319
Putting the relaunch
and the restaurant in danger.

37:07.319 --> 37:09.252
Water, water,
water, water.

37:09.252 --> 37:11.019
No, no, no.
Watch out, watch out.

37:11.019 --> 37:13.152
As the smell of smoke
enters the dining room...

37:13.152 --> 37:15.186
Watch out, please, guys.
Watch out.

37:15.186 --> 37:16.319
Chef Ramsay returns
to the kitchen

37:16.319 --> 37:17.652
And takes charge.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.686
If it hits
the pilot light.

37:18.686 --> 37:20.152
It's gonna backfire,

37:20.152 --> 37:22.252
it's gonna blow on his legs
or blow in his face.

37:22.252 --> 37:23.445
Underneath.
It's underneath.

37:23.445 --> 37:24.019
Underneath.
It's underneath.

37:24.019 --> 37:25.452
Watch out.
Watch out.

37:28.186 --> 37:29.852
hell.

37:29.852 --> 37:31.852
Watch out, guys, please.

37:31.852 --> 37:33.319
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

37:33.319 --> 37:35.186
When was the last time
that was cleaned?

37:40.119 --> 37:41.652
Chef Ramsay
got the fire out.

37:41.652 --> 37:43.252
Now we're trying
to get reorganized

37:43.252 --> 37:45.119
and back on track.

37:45.119 --> 37:47.186
I need one filet,
medium rare.

37:47.186 --> 37:48.519
One rib eye,
medium rare.

37:48.519 --> 37:50.352
Come on, guys.
Pull together.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.086
Let's go!

37:52.086 --> 37:53.445
Despite being down to only
six burners in the kitchen...

37:53.445 --> 37:54.252
Despite being down to only
six burners in the kitchen...

37:54.252 --> 37:56.819
Finally an order out.
Okay.

37:56.819 --> 37:58.319
Andy and Orlando
have led a comeback.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.086
Let's see--
veal chop, lamb chop.

38:00.086 --> 38:01.652
That's it.

38:01.652 --> 38:03.586
And Fleming has rebounded
from the fire.

38:03.586 --> 38:04.619
Roasted chicken.

38:04.619 --> 38:05.786
This is outstanding.

38:05.786 --> 38:06.919
It's delicious.

38:10.286 --> 38:12.286
People were extremely
responsive

38:12.286 --> 38:13.319
to the new menu.

38:13.319 --> 38:14.686
They loved the items.

38:14.686 --> 38:17.352
They were socializing
and having a good time.

38:17.352 --> 38:19.152
It was more noise than
I've heard in this restaurant

38:19.152 --> 38:20.486
in 15 years.

38:20.486 --> 38:23.119
It's just refreshing
to see it this way.

38:23.119 --> 38:23.445
Are you ready
for dessert?

38:23.445 --> 38:24.786
Are you ready
for dessert?

38:24.786 --> 38:26.452
The chocolate mousse.

38:26.452 --> 38:27.786
We want one of everything.

38:27.786 --> 38:29.019
Ohh! Very good.

38:29.019 --> 38:32.486
The dessert trolley
was sensational.

38:32.486 --> 38:33.786
And everyone
loved the desserts.

38:33.786 --> 38:35.952
There's nothing left behind.
Nothing to box.

38:35.952 --> 38:36.986
No swans.

38:36.986 --> 38:38.952
Cheers to you.
Thanks.

38:38.952 --> 38:40.952
To the continued success
of your restaurant.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.119
Hope for you the best, sir.
Thank you, very much.

38:43.119 --> 38:45.152
Thanks so much.
You have a good night.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.952
Okay, uh, guys,

38:51.952 --> 38:53.445
come over, please.

38:53.445 --> 38:54.686
come over, please.

38:54.686 --> 38:56.652
It was a tough night.
It was a successful night.

38:56.652 --> 38:58.186
But the oven
slowed up service.

38:58.186 --> 39:00.786
So it's gonna be
very difficult to produce

39:00.786 --> 39:03.152
this new menu, or any menu,
for that matter,

39:03.152 --> 39:04.286
with the equipment we have.

39:04.286 --> 39:07.952
Yeah, what a night.
What a significant difference.

39:07.952 --> 39:10.019
Wasn't there a new energy
in the dining room tonight?

39:10.019 --> 39:11.019
A sort of vibe of--
Yes.

39:11.019 --> 39:12.752
Yeah?
People were alive.

39:12.752 --> 39:14.452
Yeah, we energized.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.186
Any one of you could have
thrown in the towel.

39:17.186 --> 39:19.152
And given up.

39:19.152 --> 39:20.752
And you held your own.

39:20.752 --> 39:23.319
And I--I believed
in the passion

39:23.319 --> 39:23.445
and the fight
and the determination

39:23.445 --> 39:24.852
and the fight
and the determination

39:24.852 --> 39:26.286
to make
this restaurant work.

39:26.286 --> 39:27.452
Thank you, sir.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.252
That was the good news.

39:29.252 --> 39:32.452
But...there's
a big problem here.

39:32.452 --> 39:34.152
Yeah, this problem

39:34.152 --> 39:38.119
will prevent Fleming
from being a success.

39:39.619 --> 39:41.786
I need you to follow me.

39:41.786 --> 39:42.952
All of you.
Please.

39:42.952 --> 39:44.986
Well, I was scared

39:44.986 --> 39:46.086
And I wanted to get away.

39:46.086 --> 39:50.486
Because I had no idea
what was going to happen.

39:50.486 --> 39:52.952
Let's hurry up, please.
Come out.

39:52.952 --> 39:53.445
Hurry up.
Stand over there, please.

39:53.445 --> 39:55.152
Hurry up.
Stand over there, please.

39:57.152 --> 39:58.152
Oh, dear.

39:58.152 --> 40:02.686
Tonight, I was forced
to make an emergency call.

40:02.686 --> 40:06.786
And this is the result
of that call.

40:12.119 --> 40:13.152
There we are.

40:14.352 --> 40:16.419
Oh, my God.

40:17.486 --> 40:19.186
A state-of-the-art,

40:19.186 --> 40:20.186
brand-new,

40:20.186 --> 40:22.786
tailor-made Vulcan kitchen.

40:22.786 --> 40:23.445
When that tarp
came off,

40:23.445 --> 40:23.819
When that tarp
came off,

40:23.819 --> 40:26.152
I just felt this whole
sense of relief.

40:26.152 --> 40:28.619
This was amazing.
This was the missing link.

40:28.619 --> 40:30.486
Oh, Orlando!

40:30.486 --> 40:32.252
Oh, my God.

40:32.252 --> 40:34.686
What the hell?

40:34.686 --> 40:37.119
That's one of the most
beautiful thing

40:37.119 --> 40:38.752
I've ever seen
in my life.

40:38.752 --> 40:39.786
That's too much.

40:39.786 --> 40:42.486
Wow! That's for us?
Come on.

40:42.486 --> 40:45.286
We're starting off with
a unique, six-ring burner.

40:45.286 --> 40:47.086
A convection oven.

40:47.086 --> 40:48.252
Phenomenal.

40:48.252 --> 40:50.286
Followed by a six-burner,
diamond-cut

40:50.286 --> 40:51.752
char grill.

40:51.752 --> 40:53.445
And then, finally,
the most amazing fryer.

40:53.445 --> 40:53.586
And then, finally,
the most amazing fryer.

40:53.586 --> 40:57.186
I'm very  happy.

40:57.186 --> 40:58.252
It's being
installed tonight.

40:58.252 --> 40:59.786
Now you have no excuse.

40:59.786 --> 41:00.852
Wow.

41:00.852 --> 41:02.819
No excuse.

41:02.819 --> 41:04.452
Andy and Suzanne,
you have everything you need

41:04.452 --> 41:06.086
inside that restaurant now.

41:06.086 --> 41:07.486
Floor staff,
great decor,

41:07.486 --> 41:10.152
great chef, great menu,
and a new kitchen.

41:10.152 --> 41:14.919
Now...take it
and run with it.

41:14.919 --> 41:16.152
Thank you so much.

41:18.086 --> 41:19.986
I...Um...

41:19.986 --> 41:22.852
I'm just...

41:22.852 --> 41:23.445
I can't
express myself well.

41:23.445 --> 41:24.419
I can't
express myself well.

41:24.419 --> 41:26.419
Good-bye, my darling.
Thank you so much.

41:26.419 --> 41:28.119
I never,
in my wildest dreams,

41:28.119 --> 41:30.252
imagined we would be given
so much.

41:30.252 --> 41:32.286
Well done, my darling.
Thank you very much.

41:32.286 --> 41:33.752
Great, well done.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.619
There's absolutely
hope for Fleming.

41:35.619 --> 41:38.186
We are going
to make Ramsay proud,

41:38.186 --> 41:40.086
and we're gonna
do it for ourselves too.

41:40.086 --> 41:41.652
Well done for tonight.
Thank you.

41:41.652 --> 41:42.919
Really well done.
Thank you.

41:42.919 --> 41:44.252
Yes?
Yes, yes.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.119
Restaurateur,

41:45.119 --> 41:46.486
'cause that's
what you showed.

41:46.486 --> 41:48.186
Thank you.
Now do it.

41:48.186 --> 41:50.019
I will.

41:50.019 --> 41:51.186
Good luck.
Make it work.

41:51.186 --> 41:52.352
Thank you.
Good night.

41:52.352 --> 41:53.445
Good night.
Thank you.

41:53.445 --> 41:53.786
Good night.
Thank you.

41:53.786 --> 41:56.119
Chef Ramsay did
a lot of what was necessary

41:56.119 --> 41:57.819
to get this restaurant
on track.

41:57.819 --> 41:59.252
He really found
the right idea

41:59.252 --> 42:00.952
and the right design.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.286
I think
it's gonna save us.

42:02.286 --> 42:03.519
I think it's gonna
turn us around.

42:03.519 --> 42:05.852
Wow, what a week.

42:05.852 --> 42:07.952
Out of all the kitchen
nightmares I've ever done,

42:07.952 --> 42:10.652
this has to be the biggest
transformation ever.

42:10.652 --> 42:12.286
We completely changed
the decor,

42:12.286 --> 42:14.252
completely
changed the menu.

42:14.252 --> 42:17.186
But the biggest change of all
was in the owner, Andy.

42:17.186 --> 42:19.286
Now he can make
his own history

42:19.286 --> 42:21.286
as opposed to buying
somebody else's.

42:21.286 --> 42:23.445
My goodness.

42:23.445 --> 42:24.186
My goodness.

42:24.186 --> 42:25.586
Caesar salad with carrots?

42:26.586 --> 42:27.919
Unreal.

42:27.919 --> 42:29.319
Group hug!
Group hug!

42:29.319 --> 42:32.086
Group hug!
Group hug!

42:37.519 --> 42:39.519
After Chef Ramsay left,

42:39.519 --> 42:42.319
Andy and his loyal staff
embraced the changes

42:42.319 --> 42:43.752
that Gordon put in place.

42:43.752 --> 42:45.352
Wow, ready to use.

42:45.352 --> 42:47.086
And, with a brand-new
kitchen...

42:47.086 --> 42:48.319
Whoo!

42:48.319 --> 42:50.019
And a new lease on life...

42:50.019 --> 42:52.119
Oh, yeah, that's the sound
like we're looking for.

42:52.119 --> 42:53.445
Fleming has once again
become the place to eat,

42:53.445 --> 42:55.252
Fleming has once again
become the place to eat,

42:55.252 --> 42:56.686
Like it was 20 years ago.

42:56.686 --> 42:58.086
I can run a restaurant.

42:58.086 --> 42:59.352
I just needed
the fire back.

42:59.352 --> 43:01.252
Your menu
looks beautiful, man.

43:01.252 --> 43:03.519
Fleming's is gonna be around
for at least another 20 years.

43:03.519 --> 43:04.986
Hi, welcome to Fleming's.

43:04.986 --> 43:06.619
Have a seat.
We'll be right there.

43:06.619 --> 43:10.297
I think, yeah, we're gonna
be on the right track.
