turkey sandwich,

00:08.486 --> 00:12.142
no crust coming right up.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.361
- Strong and black
like your woman.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.666
- [chuckles]

00:14.710 --> 00:18.061
Do not distract me from apples.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.498
Peeled apples, that's key.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.545
Bread here is going to go on
both sides on the sandwich.

00:23.588 --> 00:28.245
OJ in the blue cuppie.
And I got a problem.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.551
- What?
- I'm out of sun butter.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.422
Do you happen
to have any soy nut,

00:31.466 --> 00:33.729
almond, oats, anything?
- I do not.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.165
- Da-da?

00:35.209 --> 00:37.080
- Would you do me
a favor and just--

00:37.124 --> 00:38.516
just do her lunch real quick?
I'll be right back.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.085
- Wait. Her lunch?
Yes, yes, of course.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.262
Wait, her lunch? I don't--

01:30.438 --> 01:32.353
- Are you trying
to ruin your life?

01:32.396 --> 01:34.790
- All I did was suggest coffee.

01:34.833 --> 01:38.141
- With a super-hot
French street artist,

01:38.185 --> 01:40.883
who, on at least one occasion,

01:40.926 --> 01:42.189
you actually--
- Oh, no, no.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.234
Bloom, we were
in a relationship,

01:44.278 --> 01:47.585
and I cannot believe
I told you that.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.283
- Well, I guess I just have
one of those faces

01:49.326 --> 01:50.762
where people want
to tell me things.

01:50.806 --> 01:55.245
- Look, I acknowledge
how kinetic it was between us.

01:55.289 --> 01:58.857
Like this delicious feeling
of butterflies all over my skin

01:58.901 --> 02:02.905
whenever he was even
remotely close to me.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.254
But we've both moved on.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.778
It's just--it's gonna be nice
to catch up.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.389
- Over a quick cup of coffee.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.607
- Yeah,
over a quick cup of coffee.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.131
- Okay, look, I get it.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.915
In three weeks, your whole life
is gonna be different.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.613
It is completely natural
to have a total breakdown

02:15.657 --> 02:17.528
right about now.
- It's only a bit of fun.

02:17.572 --> 02:18.834
Besides, he hasn't
even texted back.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.183
He--he might not.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.489
- You know he will.

02:21.532 --> 02:25.580
And if you're honest,
you kinda want him to.

02:25.623 --> 02:28.191
Look, for your own emotional
safety, across the board,

02:28.235 --> 02:30.280
the best thing to do
is bail, okay?

02:32.369 --> 02:34.371
Is that him?

02:38.332 --> 02:39.898
Helen?

02:39.942 --> 02:41.944
- Sandra Fall.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.947
My tenacity knows no bounds.
I will catch up with you.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.644
Um, I know you're not
a political person,

02:46.688 --> 02:48.429
but non-politically,
you're on my team.

02:48.472 --> 02:49.952
So where is she?
- Who?

02:49.995 --> 02:52.476
- The monster who gave me this
"to don't" list to stop me

02:52.520 --> 02:54.609
from doing anything remotely
helpful for this hospital.

02:54.652 --> 02:55.784
- Veronica's at
some conference.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.221
- Wait, wait,
she's--she's not here?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.831
- Mm-hm, and she just
wanted to make sure

02:59.875 --> 03:00.832
you don't do anything...

03:00.876 --> 03:03.487
- Dr. Kao?
- Stupid. I tried.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.663
- Did you still need approval
to change those

03:05.707 --> 03:07.926
intake protocols
for dementia patients?

03:07.970 --> 03:10.842
- Dr. Fuentes said if I wanted
a yes, I'd have to wait.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.671
- That's funny because
I'm saying yes right now.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.543
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.240
- It's pretty expensive.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.591
- Day of yes, Agnes.
Day of yes.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.333
Did you ask Dr. Fuentes
for 12 new fetal monitors?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.682
- I did,
but I haven't heard back yet.

03:24.726 --> 03:25.857
- Well, you're hearing back
right now

03:25.901 --> 03:27.816
and the answer is yes.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.861

the time to read my memo

for the night shift workers.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.908
I don't even work

this is about?

04:02.546 --> 04:05.897
- Oh. Um, what's up?

04:07.769 --> 04:12.295
- As you know, I've been, uh...

04:12.339 --> 04:15.385
I've been seeing someone.

Okay, Mr. Rayburn,

about your fall?

05:23.671 --> 05:25.629

qualify for nationals.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.810
And what's the last thing
you remember on impact?

05:32.854 --> 05:34.725
- Falling.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.032
- Okay.
Don't you have paperwork?

05:37.075 --> 05:38.425
Thank you.
- On it.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.513
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.992

05:41.036 --> 05:43.778

05:43.821 --> 05:45.736

but not in a way that's
gonna make me freak out.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.873
- Okay, Mr. Rayburn, what
concerns me isn't your head,

05:51.916 --> 05:54.049

without a caregiver.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.488

05:58.532 --> 06:00.011
- Where is he?

06:00.055 --> 06:02.405
- And help has arrived.

It's real close!

Wait for it.

What you want me to say?

07:41.852 --> 07:43.854
"I have stage three
pancreatic cancer

07:43.898 --> 07:46.030
and it's kicking my ass?"

It's been eight years

07:49.643 --> 07:51.949
I didn't want to bother you.

all right?

07:55.866 --> 07:57.128

Will you tell her
for me, please?

The tumor is wrapped

and his superior
mesenteric arteries.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.978
I'm sorry, but it is
my opinion that surgery

08:21.022 --> 08:23.285
isn't worth the risk.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.336
- If it's not impossible,

09:08.635 --> 09:11.681

surgical privileges.

09:11.725 --> 09:12.987
All right, this hallway's
a little shorter

09:13.030 --> 09:14.684
than we're used to,
so I'm gonna talk fast.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.904
Your patient's tumor
is unresectable

09:16.947 --> 09:19.123
because it spread
to the hepatic hilum,

09:19.167 --> 09:21.952
and it envelops
the hepatoduodenal ligament

09:21.996 --> 09:23.780
and all surrounding structures.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.216
The portal vein is compressed

and the superior
mesenteric vein.

even a candidate

and yet here you are

09:30.787 --> 09:33.877
with your entire
surgical team, why?

09:33.921 --> 09:36.010
- Multivisceral
ex-vivo surgery.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.055
It's curative,
but extremely rare.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.274
Takes at least 20 hours,

09:39.317 --> 09:41.232

in a second team,

09:41.276 --> 09:42.669

09:42.712 --> 09:44.671

around $2 million.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.150
But before you say no,

09:46.194 --> 09:48.239
know that it is your patient's
only viable option.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.893
- Yes.

- Yes, you are aware of that?

09:51.242 --> 09:53.854
- Yes to the ex-vivo.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.203

of my hospital

09:55.246 --> 09:56.334

09:56.378 --> 09:58.423
I can't think of any who would.

So, uh, we're doing this.

10:01.775 --> 10:06.257
- So how are you gonna resect
a tumor this pervasive?

10:06.301 --> 10:07.824
- Oh, I'm gonna remove

10:07.868 --> 10:09.434
all the patient's
abdominal organs,

10:09.478 --> 10:12.046

whatever looks good back in.
