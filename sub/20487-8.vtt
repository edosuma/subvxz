02:12.449 --> 02:14.410
Everything old is new again.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.011
Maybe not.

02:16.051 --> 02:17.913
I come close
sometimes to believing

02:17.953 --> 02:22.015
that nothing actually
ever changes.

02:26.288 --> 02:29.090
Back in the beginning,
fresh out of the kitchen,

02:29.120 --> 02:30.921
when I first went out
in the world

02:30.961 --> 02:33.223
trying to figure out
how to make television,

02:33.263 --> 02:36.425
I came to Northern Portugal.

02:36.465 --> 02:38.196
Little did I know
what I would find.

02:40.568 --> 02:42.099
Up until then,

02:42.129 --> 02:44.400
for 30 years spent
working in kitchens,

02:44.430 --> 02:46.572
meat had come
wrapped in plastic.

02:46.602 --> 02:48.503
I'd order it in boxes.

02:48.533 --> 02:51.335
I had never seen an animal die

02:51.375 --> 02:52.906
because I was making dinner.

02:52.936 --> 02:54.777
Ooh.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.083
Hi.
How are you guys doing?

03:13.119 --> 03:15.221
Oh, man, they can be so cruel.

03:38.266 --> 03:41.468
All right, ciao.

03:41.508 --> 03:45.271
Oh, man. Oof.

03:45.311 --> 03:47.973
I had to call the crisis center.

04:01.452 --> 04:05.224
Portugal, sandwiched between
Spain and the Atlantic Ocean,

04:05.254 --> 04:06.985
and tiny as countries go,

04:07.025 --> 04:09.987
has had an outsized impact
on the world.

04:11.528 --> 04:13.390
During the Age of Discovery,

04:13.430 --> 04:15.961
the Portuguese went to sea
in great numbers,

04:15.991 --> 04:20.363
and gained fame as navigators,
ship builders, and explorers.

04:22.035 --> 04:23.937
They conquered
a large part of the world,

04:23.967 --> 04:26.268
their empire stretching
from Brazil,

04:26.298 --> 04:29.040
to Africa, to the East Indies.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.104
The city of Oporto
is a reflection

04:35.144 --> 04:39.607
and a creation of that
relationship with the sea.

04:39.647 --> 04:43.179
A lot has changed
since I was last here.

04:43.209 --> 04:44.250
Or has it?

05:04.294 --> 05:05.825
When I decided to return

05:05.865 --> 05:07.796
to take another look
at this place,

05:07.826 --> 05:09.827
I, of course, reached out
to Jose de Meirelles,

05:09.867 --> 05:12.469
my old boss and
first entre to Portugal.

05:12.499 --> 05:13.700
How you doing, man?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.371
- You look good.
- You good?

05:15.401 --> 05:17.833
- Yeah, nice to see you.
- It's been a long, long time.

05:17.873 --> 05:20.034
Jose is from the area
around Oporto,

05:20.074 --> 05:22.035
and this time,
just like back then,

05:22.075 --> 05:25.438
he said "Come, see
my country, meet my family."

05:25.478 --> 05:26.538
We'll do a pig feast."

05:26.578 --> 05:28.039
16 years later.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.981
I came here in 2001,
one of the first times

05:31.011 --> 05:33.783
I've ever been on television,
and here we are again.

05:33.813 --> 05:36.285
There are only so many beautiful
places left in the world.

05:36.315 --> 05:39.387
Oporto is one of them.
It's gorgeous.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.048
Has it changed too much?

05:41.088 --> 05:42.889
Eh, yes, especially
in the big cities.

05:42.919 --> 05:44.991
Especially Oporto,
it change a lot.

05:45.021 --> 05:46.652
It was never too rich town.

05:46.692 --> 05:48.853
Now it's packed with tourists.

05:48.893 --> 05:50.510
So that's... is that
good news or bad news?

05:50.524 --> 05:51.895
- Yeah, it's good news.
- Good news.

05:51.925 --> 05:53.626
I mean, it's good
for the economy,

05:53.656 --> 05:55.127
and especially it came up

05:55.157 --> 05:57.159
during the big financial
crisis and all that.

05:57.199 --> 06:00.331
So it was a great job
for the city.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.803
I mean, it looks even prettier
than it looked last time.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.035
They seem to have fixed up
a lot of buildings.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.248
So what are we eating here?
It's the specialty?

06:25.278 --> 06:28.179
Oh, actually we're gonna
start with.

06:28.219 --> 06:30.181
That's small sardines.

06:35.084 --> 06:37.856
You eat everything. The bones.
You eat the whole thing.

06:37.886 --> 06:39.757
You can eat a thousand of them,

06:39.787 --> 06:41.528
and the plate is empty
so that's a good thing.

06:41.558 --> 06:43.360
Nobody can tell you
how many you eat.

06:43.390 --> 06:46.432
You ready for the tripes?

06:46.462 --> 06:48.263
- Yes.
- Absolutely, let's go.

06:51.635 --> 06:53.236
- Tripeiros, right?
- Tripas.

06:53.266 --> 06:56.338
We are known as the tripas,
that's tripe people.

06:56.368 --> 06:58.600
Why?

07:05.304 --> 07:07.175
Right.

07:07.205 --> 07:10.548
The people from Oporto gave
them all the meat they had.

07:10.578 --> 07:12.209
- So they...
- All they're left with...

07:12.249 --> 07:13.610
Just with the tripes.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.111
It's cheap food for the sailors.

07:15.151 --> 07:16.412
It would last a long time.

07:16.452 --> 07:17.712
And it usually is on Thursday.

07:17.753 --> 07:19.113
That's the day with the tripes,

07:19.153 --> 07:20.755
because being
a Catholic country,

07:20.785 --> 07:23.386
on Friday, they skip the meat.

07:26.258 --> 07:29.961
A meal here is, generally
speaking anyway, not light.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.922
The Portuguese like pork.

07:31.962 --> 07:33.793
They like it a lot.

07:33.823 --> 07:35.464
So sausage, bacon.

07:35.494 --> 07:38.096
- Sausage, pig's ear.
- Cured pig's ear.

07:38.126 --> 07:39.867
What do you do
when left with nothing

07:39.897 --> 07:42.029
but guts and hooves
and odd bits?

07:42.069 --> 07:44.700
You have the tripes here,
some beans.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.772
Figure out how to transform that

07:46.802 --> 07:50.174
into delicious,
delicious things, of course.

07:56.338 --> 07:58.540
Oh, wow, look at that.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.081
Oh, that's fantastic.

08:00.111 --> 08:01.882
- It smells delicious.
- Perfect. Yes, it does.

08:01.912 --> 08:04.143
So I put a little rice on
the side there to mop it up?

08:04.183 --> 08:05.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:08.186 --> 08:10.087
Mmm.

08:10.117 --> 08:12.489
That is good.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.031
Mmm.

08:33.003 --> 08:35.664
I mean, it's sort of incredible
the story of the wines here.

08:35.703 --> 08:38.066
I hear that because the soil

08:38.106 --> 08:40.568
is so tough with flint
and stones also,

08:40.607 --> 08:44.740
the vines have to dig
up to 30 meters down.

08:44.771 --> 08:46.512
But it's a lot.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.643
I think it gives the wine
a special character.

08:52.045 --> 08:54.347
Northern Portugal's Douro Valley

08:54.377 --> 08:55.778
is where Port comes from.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.352
If it's not from here,
it's not Port.

09:01.382 --> 09:03.353
It's just fortified wine.

09:13.890 --> 09:16.332
I don't usually do wine scenes.

09:16.362 --> 09:19.464
No matter how good the wine,
on camera

09:19.494 --> 09:22.536
it's just colored liquid
going into a glass.

09:22.566 --> 09:24.467
Wine nerds usually bore me.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.369
Don't talk about
your damn wine, drink it.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.372
But I absolutely love
cheese served

09:32.402 --> 09:34.304
with a glass of Port wine,

09:34.344 --> 09:37.205
and that's what most people,
including my new friend Andre,

09:37.245 --> 09:39.007
that's what they do around here.

09:39.047 --> 09:41.208
I'm not a dessert guy,
but a nice blue cheese

09:41.248 --> 09:43.710
with a glass of port,
for me, is, like,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.382
the perfect thing
to end a meal with.

09:46.412 --> 09:49.714
Unlike wine,
cheese porn is easy.

09:49.754 --> 09:51.785
Just like shooting actual porn.

09:51.815 --> 09:55.458
Start with an establishing
shot, move in for a close...

09:55.488 --> 09:57.019
Oh, yeah, there we go.

09:57.059 --> 09:58.890
...cut away to a reaction.

09:58.920 --> 09:59.690
Mmm.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.721
Money.

10:00.761 --> 10:02.392
Works every time.

10:02.422 --> 10:05.865
Oh, that's disturbing.
I mean, it's delicious.

10:05.895 --> 10:08.066
What kind of cheeses
are we looking at here?

10:08.096 --> 10:10.828
These two over here,
they're goat cheese.

10:10.868 --> 10:12.069
They're aged ones.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.530
Then all the other
are sheep milk.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.902
This is worldly known
Queijo Serra,

10:16.932 --> 10:18.733
so the buttery one.

10:18.773 --> 10:21.175
This is what we call
a Queijo Azeitao.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.736
It's strong,
intense to your palate.

10:22.776 --> 10:24.537
Oh, I like this guy already.

10:24.577 --> 10:26.809
Any cheese that are, like,
you need a spoon pretty much.

10:26.839 --> 10:29.410
Oh, then smell it.
For me, the worse the smell,

10:29.440 --> 10:30.881
the better the flavor.

10:30.911 --> 10:32.813
- Mmm.
- Huh? Like it?

10:32.843 --> 10:35.344
Smells like dirty feet.
Tastes like heaven.

10:36.715 --> 10:39.087
This is a 30-year-old Port.

11:16.111 --> 11:18.443
- Oh, that's delicious.
- Yeah.

11:18.473 --> 11:19.744
Put a little bit of that

11:19.774 --> 11:21.615
and then some pumpkin jam
on top.

11:21.645 --> 11:24.417
Mmm. If I put on my Speedo
and dive into this thing,

11:24.447 --> 11:28.380
please stop me before
I completely face plant.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.074
Oh, no, no, no.
I love Portuguese gastronomy.

11:30.081 --> 11:32.452
The heart and soul of it,
its simplicity.

11:32.482 --> 11:34.023
Look, that's the thing

11:34.053 --> 11:35.978
that makes me fall in love
with it every single day.

11:35.985 --> 11:38.756
Cheese is one of those things,
it's always magic to me

11:38.787 --> 11:42.689
because it goes
into the cave one way

11:42.729 --> 11:44.390
and then you go in
and you pull it out,

11:44.430 --> 11:45.861
and, I don't believe in God,

11:45.891 --> 11:47.592
but somehow
it went in like that,

11:47.632 --> 11:49.294
and it came back like this.

11:49.334 --> 11:53.937
Relying on time to cut his way
through it and to change this.

11:53.967 --> 11:57.269
Change the texture,
even the smell,

11:57.299 --> 12:02.242
and we have nothing to do with
that other than enjoying it.

12:57.539 --> 12:59.841
Portugal has got
a lot of coastline

12:59.881 --> 13:02.012
and a lot of history
with the sea.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.183
It's a close relationship,

13:04.213 --> 13:07.245
one that's imprinted deep
within the national character.

13:07.285 --> 13:09.447
The songs.
The poetry.

13:09.487 --> 13:10.848
The state of mind.

13:10.888 --> 13:13.189
I love this word, saudade.

13:16.352 --> 13:19.994
Saudade means missing
something. Nostalgic.

13:23.226 --> 13:26.298
A word with no direct
translation to English.

13:26.328 --> 13:29.660
It connotes longing,
being away from something,

13:29.700 --> 13:31.302
and yearning to get back.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.333
The Portuguese went out
of the country

13:33.363 --> 13:35.935
for years at sea,
and he does not know

13:35.965 --> 13:38.766
when he's gonna get back
to his family.

13:48.213 --> 13:50.875
During the cold gray months,
it's lamprey season.

13:50.915 --> 13:52.446
Oh, hell yeah.

13:52.476 --> 13:54.217
So I'm here
at just the right time.

13:54.247 --> 13:55.741
What do you call
this dish in Portuguese?

13:55.748 --> 13:57.149
This is the lamprey eel?

13:57.179 --> 13:59.450
Yeah, the lamprey bordelaise.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.221
Awesome.

14:01.251 --> 14:06.385
Lamprey are butt ugly
damn creatures,

14:06.425 --> 14:08.656
but delicious when cooked right,

14:08.686 --> 14:11.388
and my man Pedro
knows how to cook it right.

14:11.428 --> 14:13.229
Very traditional.
Cooked in its own blood.

14:13.259 --> 14:15.191
Yeah, it's bordelaise style.

14:15.231 --> 14:17.662
When it's bordelaise,
it means it has the blood.

14:38.947 --> 14:41.748
Mmm, it's good.
Fantastic.

14:41.778 --> 14:44.680
Saudad is going back to a moment

14:44.710 --> 14:46.081
where you're happy.

14:46.111 --> 14:48.083
It doesn't matter
if it was through food,

14:48.113 --> 14:50.254
through sex, through wherever.

14:50.284 --> 14:52.108
You're making me sad
already thinking about this.

14:52.115 --> 14:53.416
No, but that's not sad.

14:53.456 --> 14:55.017
- I'm getting depressed.
- Come on.

14:55.057 --> 14:56.251
Yes, thinking about happy times

14:56.258 --> 14:57.759
that I can't have right now.

14:57.789 --> 14:59.420
But there's a hope in the future

14:59.460 --> 15:01.585
that that's going to happen
because that's also part of...

15:01.592 --> 15:03.893
- Yeah, no.
- Yeah, I see it like that.

15:03.923 --> 15:05.594
If you don't see it,
that's your problem.

15:20.774 --> 15:22.936
The Portuguese were
the original navigators.

15:22.976 --> 15:24.737
Yeah.

15:24.777 --> 15:27.939
It was about the sea.
About fishing, exploration.

15:47.652 --> 15:50.855
Ah, question.
I went to the fish market.

15:50.895 --> 15:53.356
I met these women
who sell fish there,

15:53.396 --> 15:55.858
and they were saying terrible,
terrible things to me.

15:55.898 --> 15:57.922
They were saying, "Hey,
pin dick, get over... you know",

15:57.929 --> 16:00.461
how do you satisfy your wife
with that tiny little penis?"

16:00.501 --> 16:04.464
My God, I've never
in my life heard women,

16:04.504 --> 16:05.965
anybody speak like this.

16:08.336 --> 16:09.807
This is what I'm gonna get?

16:09.837 --> 16:11.408
Yeah, nasty approaches

16:11.438 --> 16:13.069
about your penis
and your height, yeah.

17:35.794 --> 17:37.295
I'm Tony, hi.

17:37.325 --> 17:38.867
- I'm Sophia.
- Sophia.

17:38.897 --> 17:40.368
I'm Shanna.
Nice to meet you.

17:40.398 --> 17:42.599
- Hi. Good to meet you both.
- How are you?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.670
Those of you who know me
even a little bit

17:44.700 --> 17:46.802
are familiar
with my unholy attraction

17:46.832 --> 17:48.373
to the mutant hot dog.

17:48.403 --> 17:50.374
Is it actually called
a hot dog here or is it...

17:50.404 --> 17:53.206
- No, here we call it cachorro.
- Cachorro.

17:53.236 --> 17:55.037
Toasted bread.
Fresh sausage.

17:55.077 --> 17:56.478
Fresh pork sausage.

17:56.508 --> 17:59.110
And a cheese and a spicy sauce.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.811
And spicy sauce.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.385
And cut in a very specific way.

18:06.415 --> 18:08.786
Wow, look at...
Fast knife work.

18:11.748 --> 18:13.289
Nah.

18:13.319 --> 18:15.391
He's asking if you want
some fork and knife.

18:15.421 --> 18:17.152
No, we can eat it with the...

18:17.192 --> 18:18.693
No, we don't do that, right?

18:22.556 --> 18:23.726
Mmm. This is delicious.

18:23.756 --> 18:25.398
This is very healthy too.

18:25.428 --> 18:27.399
Yeah, it's a light dinner.

18:27.429 --> 18:28.830
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

18:28.860 --> 18:32.562
No, no, no, yeah, it is.

18:32.602 --> 18:34.734
- They're busy.
- Yeah, they're always busy.

18:34.764 --> 18:36.565
- Yeah, always busy.
- It's a small place.

18:36.605 --> 18:40.237
And you can see it's just
Portuguese, just locals.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.239
How many places
like this in town?

18:42.269 --> 18:44.410
Nowadays, not many.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.542
- Now, you guys own a tavern?
- Yes.

18:46.572 --> 18:48.473
How's employment
in Portugal now?

18:48.513 --> 18:51.175
There's a lot
of unemployment here.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.576
No, I was gonna ask,

18:52.616 --> 18:55.247
do you get a lot
of people with degrees,

18:55.277 --> 18:58.380
you know, higher degrees
who are opening restaurants?

18:58.420 --> 19:00.521
Yes. She has the degree
in psychology.

19:00.551 --> 19:02.722
I have the degree in sociology.

19:02.752 --> 19:06.255
And everyone who is working
with us they have the degree.

19:06.285 --> 19:09.427
- Yeah, or they are finishing.
- Or they are finishing.

19:09.457 --> 19:10.758
I might have to have another.

19:10.788 --> 19:13.159
That was good.

20:38.686 --> 20:41.118
This city seems to have
been preserved carefully

20:41.148 --> 20:43.420
and with respect for the past.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.151
I don't see a lot
of high rise buildings

20:45.191 --> 20:47.122
breaking up the skyline.

20:47.152 --> 20:49.494
We are still very authentic.
We don't sell out very easily.

20:49.524 --> 20:51.255
I mean, I was
in a relatively poor

20:51.295 --> 20:52.826
neighborhood
a couple of nights ago

20:52.856 --> 20:54.757
just walking around,
and somebody said,

20:54.797 --> 20:57.329
"You know, you could buy
that apartment building

20:57.359 --> 20:59.130
right there for $50,000."

20:59.160 --> 21:00.461
I said, "Okay, good deal."

21:00.501 --> 21:02.162
"But you can't touch
the exterior."

21:02.202 --> 21:05.905
Yeah, no.

21:05.935 --> 21:08.566
This is the fishing
and port area of Oporto, yes?

21:08.606 --> 21:10.267
And it's called Matosinhos.

21:10.307 --> 21:12.069
The fishing boats just arrived,

21:12.109 --> 21:15.941
and the market is just
two streets away from here.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.281
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

21:30.321 --> 21:32.953
Seafood tower, bitches.
All right then.

21:32.983 --> 21:35.154
Okay, not a tower precisely,

21:35.184 --> 21:38.786
but a whole heap of incredible
creatures from the sea.

21:41.188 --> 21:43.329
Coastal shrimp.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.961
Local oysters

21:45.991 --> 21:48.033
and crab.

21:48.063 --> 21:49.534
Sea urchin.

21:49.564 --> 21:51.935
Langoustine.
Gooseneck barnacles.

21:51.965 --> 21:53.366
This I'm very excited by.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.498
- Yeah.
- So dangerous to get these.

21:55.538 --> 21:57.199
Yeah, it's not
the thing that you get

21:57.239 --> 21:59.370
from the hulls of the boats,
but from rocks.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.341
And you've got to get it
in between waves.

22:01.371 --> 22:03.543
- Mm-hmm.
- Quickly. Whelks?

22:03.573 --> 22:07.045
- Caramujos.
- Caramujos.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.206
Oh, there we go.

22:08.246 --> 22:10.648
Mmm. Insane.

22:10.678 --> 22:13.209
One thing that I don't like
with food is sauce.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.281
Yeah, I don't need it.
This is all perfect.

22:15.311 --> 22:16.575
What do they do to it?
They steamed it, some of it.

22:16.582 --> 22:18.313
- Yeah.
- The rest is raw.

22:18.353 --> 22:20.354
It's not like this
is fancy cooking.

22:27.759 --> 22:29.860
Mmm.
This crab is...

22:29.891 --> 22:31.392
It's like a Rubik's cube.

22:31.422 --> 22:33.223
I'm trying to figure
my way into here.

22:33.263 --> 22:36.125
Okay, I found it.

22:38.366 --> 22:40.498
This is the thing that
gets you back to your roots.

22:40.528 --> 22:43.029
You have to use your hands.
You don't have to be polite.

22:43.069 --> 22:44.030
Yeah.

22:53.276 --> 22:54.677
Mmm, these little shrimp.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.178
The brains are really good too.

22:59.780 --> 23:00.981
Oh, look at that.

23:01.011 --> 23:02.742
Sea urchin, fat sacks of roe

23:02.782 --> 23:05.644
buried deep inside
these prickly exteriors.

23:05.684 --> 23:09.087
When I was a kid, I went
with my father to get these,

23:09.117 --> 23:13.089
and it was nasty,
but also very good.

23:13.119 --> 23:14.921
Mmm.

23:14.951 --> 23:16.592
It's funny, a lot of things

23:16.622 --> 23:19.394
that you see here
were used as fertilizer.

23:19.424 --> 23:22.155
In the years before
independence in Massachusetts,

23:22.195 --> 23:23.656
Lobster was seen as a pest.

23:23.696 --> 23:25.398
The only people
who used them regularly

23:25.428 --> 23:27.029
was the prison system.

23:27.059 --> 23:29.200
The prisoners rioted because
they said this is cruel

23:29.230 --> 23:31.361
and unusual punishment having
to eat lobster every day.

23:31.402 --> 23:33.203
"No, I don't want that.
It's lobster."

23:43.910 --> 23:46.942
Nobody knows who first
salt-baked a fish.

23:46.972 --> 23:48.343
Maybe it was Jesus.

23:48.373 --> 23:50.514
- Ohhh.
- Oh, wow.

23:50.544 --> 23:53.546
Scale and gut your fish,
in this case a sea bass,

23:53.576 --> 23:55.418
insert lemon and onion,

23:55.448 --> 23:57.319
then pack it in salt and bake.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.253
Light the whole thing
on fire tableside,

24:04.283 --> 24:05.854
then break open.

24:05.884 --> 24:07.886
The salt acts like
a protective crust,

24:07.926 --> 24:10.458
sealing in all
the moisture and flavor.

24:10.488 --> 24:13.930
Now, that looks beautiful.
That's perfect food.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.631
Mmm.

24:15.661 --> 24:17.632
Clams cooked Portuguese style.

24:17.662 --> 24:19.734
- Yeah.
- So tender and sweet

24:19.764 --> 24:21.635
and delicious.

24:21.665 --> 24:23.266
Why do you think Portuguese food

24:23.296 --> 24:25.438
has not had a higher profile
internationally?

24:25.468 --> 24:30.241
Well, for me it's
real easy to say this,

24:30.271 --> 24:31.942
it's basically...
It's your fault.

24:31.972 --> 24:33.903
- Our fault?
- It's the Americans' fault.

24:33.943 --> 24:35.274
Yeah.
Why?

24:35.304 --> 24:37.305
The American culture
embraced Spain.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.807
It embraced Italy.
It embraced France.

24:39.847 --> 24:43.109
It didn't embrace Portugal
because... I don't know.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.081
If we have a civil war

24:45.111 --> 24:47.482
so popular like the Spanish had,

24:47.512 --> 24:49.584
and Hemmingway came
to Portugal instead of Spain,

24:49.614 --> 24:51.985
we would be a different country.

24:52.015 --> 24:54.117
You know, you think of Italy,
you think of romance.

24:54.157 --> 24:56.488
- No, but we are romantic.
- I know. These people...

24:56.518 --> 24:58.327
We are the most romantic
country in the world.

24:58.359 --> 25:00.061
After you have a couple
of meals in Porto,

25:00.091 --> 25:03.493
you're going to feel saudade
in your heart and soul.

25:03.523 --> 25:07.466
Man, good meal.
Oh, what, there's more clams?

25:07.496 --> 25:10.167
Right over here, my friend.

25:48.723 --> 25:51.255
Contrary to what some might say,

25:51.295 --> 25:55.528
I do not enjoy seeing
the death of any living thing.

25:55.558 --> 25:58.159
I do not promote animal cruelty.

26:18.573 --> 26:20.514
- Yeah, ready to go?
- Yep.

26:20.544 --> 26:23.876
Kill the pig, kill the pig,
kill the pig.

26:23.916 --> 26:27.479
But I think people should
know where meat comes from,

26:27.519 --> 26:30.051
and knowing, they should
feel free to decide

26:30.081 --> 26:32.382
what they want to do from there.

26:38.256 --> 26:40.758
- It's the least you could do.
- Yeah, exactly, so...

26:42.229 --> 26:45.891
Here, right here
on Jose's family farm,

26:45.931 --> 26:48.533
is where I saw
my first animal die.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.234
A pig too.

26:50.264 --> 26:52.295
This, after years and decades

26:52.335 --> 26:54.067
of being a chef, serving meat,

26:54.097 --> 26:55.798
ordering up my death
over the phone

26:55.838 --> 26:57.839
at a comfortable distance.

26:57.869 --> 27:00.671
Up close, it was not
so comfortable.

27:00.701 --> 27:02.672
I think he's starting
to get the bad news.

27:02.702 --> 27:05.004
I guess on the DNA, they know
that's gonna happen and...

27:05.044 --> 27:06.845
They know it's coming.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.869
- Really they know it's coming.
- Yeah, well the pigs are smart.

27:08.876 --> 27:11.979
And sometimes
they manage to run away.

27:12.009 --> 27:15.551
To do the job right,
professionals are brought in,

27:15.581 --> 27:17.182
and they do it
like this because,

27:17.212 --> 27:19.654
how shall I put it,
they need the heart

27:19.684 --> 27:22.185
to keep pumping the blood
into the pail

27:22.215 --> 27:24.057
for sausage and soup,

27:24.087 --> 27:26.088
and many delicious things.

27:37.125 --> 27:41.068
We all come to this in the end,

27:41.098 --> 27:43.399
whether struggling for air
in our beds,

27:43.430 --> 27:45.601
bleeding out on cold concrete,

27:45.631 --> 27:49.033
a last mighty dump like Elvis,

27:49.073 --> 27:50.534
or this.

28:03.643 --> 28:06.245
Oh, yeah, it's a firecracker.

28:08.246 --> 28:10.688
That's the start of
any festivities in Portugal,

28:10.718 --> 28:13.289
is the firecracker.
Really?

28:13.319 --> 28:16.692
As befitting tradition
and the way things are done,

28:16.722 --> 28:18.893
this is a once in a year event.

28:18.923 --> 28:21.025
For two days, extended family,

28:21.055 --> 28:23.126
friends and neighbors
gather to cook,

28:23.156 --> 28:25.027
cure and eat a pig.

28:25.057 --> 28:27.259
Time for a haircut?
Yeah, haircut.

28:27.299 --> 28:29.030
- Old-school.
- Yeah.

28:34.664 --> 28:36.705
They finish up
with the blowtorch.

28:36.735 --> 28:39.467
- As one must.
- Yeah.

28:55.147 --> 28:56.548
It's like rappers.

28:56.578 --> 28:58.249
Yeah, yeah,
that's it, that's it.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.021
Free style.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.640
Up.

29:28.670 --> 29:32.242
Up. There you go.

29:34.804 --> 29:37.606
So now they gonna finish up
and take all the guts out...

29:37.646 --> 29:40.007
Take all the guts out,
and that is lunch.

29:40.047 --> 29:41.678
Lunch time.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.409
In Portugal, we used to say

29:43.450 --> 29:45.311
that if we want
to know our body,

29:45.351 --> 29:48.253
you have to kill a pig because
it's absolutely the same.

29:48.283 --> 29:51.985
All the organs are placed
on the same disposition.

29:52.015 --> 29:54.817
I see a liver there
and the heart,

29:54.857 --> 29:56.658
and you have
the tongue there too.

29:56.688 --> 29:59.360
That's all in a package,
all the good stuff.

30:00.721 --> 30:02.963
Look, it's a lung.

30:05.894 --> 30:07.125
He's good.

30:07.165 --> 30:09.027
Yeah, he really knows
what he's doing.

30:09.067 --> 30:11.868
I would say a surgeon,
but he's faster than a surgeon.

30:19.734 --> 30:22.806
Guts removed, the liver
and heart are used today.

30:22.836 --> 30:24.377
Cooked immediately.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.338
Oh, this is the best, the heart.

30:26.378 --> 30:29.380
- It's like a tender sirloin.
- Oh, it's so good.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.681
It's so good, yeah.

30:30.711 --> 30:32.212
The intestines washed

30:32.242 --> 30:34.844
and reserved for sausage casing.

30:37.315 --> 30:38.786
Mmm. Looks nice.

30:38.816 --> 30:41.388
The rest is left to hang
until tomorrow,

30:41.418 --> 30:43.990
when we shall feast again.

30:48.193 --> 30:51.655
- Ah, it's like chicharron.
- Chicharron.

30:53.026 --> 30:54.527
Oh, wow.

30:55.558 --> 30:56.858
Yeah, yeah.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.930
Oh.
That's kind of perfect.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.204
Mmm.
That's good.

31:05.234 --> 31:08.006
Not all of the countries
eat all of the meat

31:08.036 --> 31:09.237
off of the pork.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.768
And here, we eat everything.

31:18.273 --> 31:20.674
- They don't waste anything.
- Anything.

32:15.981 --> 32:20.184
Fado, the national music
of Portugal.

32:20.214 --> 32:22.886
Songs of longing, heartbreak,

32:22.916 --> 32:25.117
saudade set to music.

32:46.972 --> 32:48.773
Anthony, in Portugal

32:48.803 --> 32:51.875
everybody thinks
that they sing Fado.

32:51.905 --> 32:54.637
We, the Portuguese,
think that the Fado

32:54.677 --> 32:56.938
is not the perfection,

32:56.979 --> 33:00.241
the ability, the fine-tuning.

33:00.281 --> 33:05.314
It's emotion, so everybody's
allowed to sing.

33:05.344 --> 33:06.885
Yeah.

33:06.915 --> 33:09.547
That's why Jose is
telling that I sing Fado.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.218
I see.

33:11.248 --> 33:15.051
Normally the guys who sing
Fado are very happy guys.

33:15.091 --> 33:18.323
They are very...
But when they begin to sing,

33:18.353 --> 33:20.154
they turn into sad guys.

33:20.194 --> 33:21.725
I don't know why.

33:21.755 --> 33:24.957
Well, you said
the Portuguese are bipolar.

33:24.997 --> 33:27.229
Yes, yes they are.
They are.

33:28.930 --> 33:32.502
So ready to eat, I see, huh?
Big enough table?

33:37.866 --> 33:40.267
The home of Jose's
ancestors for centuries.

33:40.307 --> 33:44.840
Much of their original estate
still in family hands.

33:53.846 --> 33:55.447
Very exciting.

33:55.477 --> 33:57.619
Jose's mother Maria
is in charge today.

33:57.649 --> 34:01.051
She's preparing a feast of
rustic Portuguese soul food.

34:11.058 --> 34:13.129
They boil the bones out,

34:13.159 --> 34:15.184
then they finish with the
blood, so... blood and bread.

34:15.190 --> 34:17.993
- Blood and bread.
- Yeah.

34:18.033 --> 34:20.333
Mmm.

34:20.364 --> 34:22.435
Beautiful.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.739
It's so good.

34:36.645 --> 34:40.708
The main event, cozido,

34:40.748 --> 34:44.480
a glorious stew of seemingly
every last part of the pig.

34:44.510 --> 34:46.712
I'm gonna give you
some of the pernil,

34:46.752 --> 34:49.152
that is the smoked meat.

34:49.183 --> 34:50.714
Spare ribs.

34:50.754 --> 34:52.686
Nothing goes to waste
around here.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.717
The blood sausage.
Cabbage.

34:54.757 --> 34:56.888
- Oh, what's that?
- That's the butelo.

34:56.918 --> 35:00.191
It's the pig's bladder
that's stuffed with pork belly,

35:00.221 --> 35:02.462
the spare ribs, and then smoked.

35:02.492 --> 35:04.323
Wow, look at that.

35:06.325 --> 35:08.126
Extraordinary.

35:13.399 --> 35:15.531
And one little thing,
you don't feel that guilty

35:15.571 --> 35:17.732
when you eating this
because it's only just boiled.

35:17.772 --> 35:21.305
Not fried. Not...
Oh, I don't feel guilty.

35:21.335 --> 35:25.407
Oh, it's fantastic.
Oh, it's superb.

35:25.437 --> 35:28.409
Wonderful.
Thank you.

35:35.614 --> 35:37.546
So, Jose,
what's left of the pig?

35:37.586 --> 35:39.247
A couple of hams
and not much else.

35:39.287 --> 35:41.548
Well, the everything
is on salt right now.

35:41.588 --> 35:44.250
So the shoulders
and the legs are in salt?

35:44.290 --> 35:45.907
They're on salt.
They're gonna be in salt

35:45.921 --> 35:47.422
for about three months,

35:47.452 --> 35:49.423
and then they're going
to be smoked

35:49.453 --> 35:51.355
and they are a prosciutto.

35:51.395 --> 35:54.757
And they are fantastic.

35:54.797 --> 35:57.729
So you spoke about
Fado and sadness,

35:57.759 --> 36:00.661
but, you know,
after a few drinks,

36:00.701 --> 36:02.102
everybody gets very happy,
you know?

36:02.132 --> 36:04.764
Good.

36:04.804 --> 36:06.735
Means, "With wine, happiness."

36:06.765 --> 36:08.106
- Yeah!
- Cheers.

36:08.136 --> 36:10.167
- Yeah.
- Happiness, happiness.

36:10.207 --> 36:12.669
Thank you.

38:13.489 --> 38:15.020
Cheers.

38:18.853 --> 38:22.155
Now it's time
for the francesinha,

38:22.195 --> 38:25.497
which translates
as little French girl?

38:25.528 --> 38:26.828
Yeah, yeah.

38:26.858 --> 38:28.222
But I understand
she's not so little.

38:28.229 --> 38:29.800
- No, it's not.
- No.

38:29.830 --> 38:31.602
It's your first time,
francesinha?

38:31.632 --> 38:33.333
- It is.
- Really?

38:33.363 --> 38:35.634
You have this look
on your face like...

38:35.664 --> 38:37.205
You look worried.

38:37.235 --> 38:40.307
- Good luck.
- It's gonna be okay, right?

38:40.337 --> 38:42.609
Oh, here we go.

38:42.639 --> 38:44.940
- Oh, thank you.
- What do we got?

38:44.970 --> 38:46.942
Good Lord, look at that thing.

38:46.972 --> 38:49.343
Is there a vegetable in there?

38:49.373 --> 38:51.475
- Only meat.
- Oh, my God.

38:51.515 --> 38:53.846
It weighs, like, a ton.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.884
So it's bread, ham...

39:05.924 --> 39:06.885
Mm-hmm.

39:06.925 --> 39:08.826
Steak...

39:08.856 --> 39:10.387
Sausage, and a bit of...

39:10.427 --> 39:12.489
- Linguica.
- Yeah, linguica.

39:15.331 --> 39:18.663
And then the sauce
has many things like beer,

39:18.693 --> 39:22.966
Port wine, spicy, tomato.

39:22.996 --> 39:25.898
- Cheese.
- A lot of cheese. A lot.

39:25.938 --> 39:28.069
Wow.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.241
What a construction.

39:30.271 --> 39:34.844
Meat, cheese, fat and bread?
It's the immortal combination.

39:34.874 --> 39:36.305
Yeah, it's the ultimate solution

39:36.345 --> 39:38.206
for a hangover or too much pork.

39:44.580 --> 39:46.181
That is delicious.

39:46.211 --> 39:48.012
Oh, that's good.
It's really, really good.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.884
Are there a lot
of places making this?

39:49.914 --> 39:51.085
- Mmm.
- A lot.

39:51.115 --> 39:52.656
- Yeah.
- Everyone does.

39:52.686 --> 39:54.917
And this is a Oporto
thing specifically?

39:54.957 --> 39:57.689
- Yes.
- Yeah.

39:57.719 --> 39:59.660
What's the relative rate

39:59.690 --> 40:03.663
per capita of heart-related
disease in this country?

40:03.693 --> 40:05.094
I'm just curious.

40:05.124 --> 40:07.666
It depends on how many
francesinha you had.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.697
Oh, right.

40:40.948 --> 40:44.050
Oh-oh, oh-oh.
How are you doing?

40:46.652 --> 40:50.254
No, I don't know. Today?
You guys need any fish?

40:50.294 --> 40:52.055
Thank you.

41:41.028 --> 41:44.660
Everything old is new again,
maybe not.

41:44.690 --> 41:47.232
I come close sometimes
to believing

41:47.262 --> 41:49.493
that nothing
actually ever changes,

41:49.533 --> 41:51.895
that we are trapped
in our destiny,

41:51.935 --> 41:53.466
hurtling or limping

41:53.496 --> 41:55.968
or being dragged
towards the inevitable.

41:55.998 --> 41:59.000
That saudade refers
not to a long-lost place,

41:59.040 --> 42:00.601
but a long-lost time

42:00.641 --> 42:03.173
when we were all
young and innocent.

42:03.203 --> 42:06.305
Saudade can help
you value things.

42:06.345 --> 42:09.677
Be grateful for just a sunset.
Enjoy that. Smile.

42:09.707 --> 42:11.578
- Enjoy it now.
- Yes.

42:11.608 --> 42:12.779
Because tomorrow we die.

42:12.809 --> 42:13.950
Yeah, you never know.
