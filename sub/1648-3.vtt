WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.664
(thunder rumbling)

00:04.838 --> 00:07.454
Merle:
That's right. You heard me, bitch.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.088
You got a problem?

00:09.259 --> 00:11.341
Bring it on
if you're man enough,

00:11.511 --> 00:14.548
or take it up the chain
if you're a pussy.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.387
You heard me,
you pussy-ass noncom bitch.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.176
You ain't deaf.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.219
Take it up
the damn chain of command

00:23.398 --> 00:27.983
or you can kiss my lily-white ass.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.109
( laughs )
That's right.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.521
That's what I said.
You heard me.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.111
And then this idiot,
he takes a swing,

00:35.285 --> 00:37.241
you know, and well...

00:37.412 --> 00:40.495
( laughing hysterically )

00:40.665 --> 00:43.498
Oh, you should've seen
the look on his face

00:43.668 --> 00:46.956
when l punched out his front teeth.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.581
Yeah, five of 'em.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.546
Pow! Pow! Just like that.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.551
Huh.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.713
Oh my god.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.099
16 months in the stockade--

01:01.269 --> 01:04.432
oh, that's what them teeth cost me.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.144
That was--

01:08.318 --> 01:10.855
that was hard time,

01:12.197 --> 01:15.064
but by God,
it was worth every minute of it

01:16.367 --> 01:18.198
just to see that prick

01:18.369 --> 01:20.405
spit his teeth out on the ground.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.039
Yes sir,

01:25.210 --> 01:26.746
worth every minute.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.124
Mmm.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.209
(wind blowing)

01:49.692 --> 01:51.102
Oh no.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.110
No no! No no! No no!

01:54.280 --> 01:55.816
God! God!

01:55.990 --> 01:58.322
No no!
(grunts)

01:58.493 --> 02:00.529
God! Jesus!

02:00.703 --> 02:02.113
No no, merciful Christ!

02:02.288 --> 02:03.789
No no. No no.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.199
God, help me! God! God!

02:07.377 --> 02:10.244
Jesus, please! Jesus, please.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.958
Help me! Come on now!

02:13.133 --> 02:14.669
Help me.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.834
(zombies growling, banging)

02:23.059 --> 02:24.424
(softly )
No no. Oh, no no.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.887
Oh my God.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.348
Shh shh shh shh shh.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.936
(crying )
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.487
No no no no no no.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.159
Please.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.533
I didn't behave, I know.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.660
I know I'm being punished.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.867
I know. |--

02:47.041 --> 02:49.373
oh, I deserve it. I deserve it.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.954
I've been bad.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.835
Help me now.
Show me the way.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.341
Go on, tell me what to do.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.012
Tell me. Tell me.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.093
God!

03:11.566 --> 03:13.648
(grunting)

03:15.820 --> 03:17.685
That's okay.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.447
Never you mind, silly Christ boy.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.529
I ain't begged you before.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.035
I ain't gonna start begging now.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.618
I ain't gonna beg you now!

03:28.791 --> 03:31.703
Don't you worry about me

03:31.878 --> 03:34.836
begging you ever!
I'll never beg you!

03:35.006 --> 03:37.213
I ain't gonna beg you!

03:37.383 --> 03:39.544
I never begged you before.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.426
- ( grunting)
-( banging, growling continues)

03:42.597 --> 03:45.464
Oh shit.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.559
No!

03:50.730 --> 03:53.346
(theme music playing )

04:28.685 --> 04:30.596
Best not to dwell on it.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.931
Merle got left behind.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.557
Nobody's gonna be sad
he didn't come back...

04:39.612 --> 04:41.568
except maybe Daryl.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.401
- Daryl?
- His brother.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.282
( car alarm approaching )

04:47.453 --> 04:50.069
(Glenn whooping)

04:52.000 --> 04:53.956
Whoo-hoo!

04:56.212 --> 04:58.794
At least somebody's
having a good day.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.713
-( rattling)
-( kids grunting)

05:01.884 --> 05:05.092
- Girl: Give it back.
- Boy: Stop it.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.222
- Girl: No!
- Boy: lfound it.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.303
- Girl: No!
- Boy: Give it.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.092
M'hijo, leave your sister alone.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.602
- Why?
- Come on.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.728
Baby, the more you fidget,
the longer it takes.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.481
- So don't, okay?
- I'm trying.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.732
Well, try harder.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.154
Shane:
If you think this is bad,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.779
wait till you start shaving.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.155
That stings.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.567
That day comes,
you'll be wishing

05:28.745 --> 05:30.030
for one of your mama's haircuts.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.661
- I'll believe that when | see it.
- ( Shane chuckles)

05:32.832 --> 05:34.993
I'll tell you what--
you just get through this

05:35.168 --> 05:39.036
with some manly dignity and tomorrow
I'll teach you something special.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.751
I will teach you to catch frogs.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.008
- I've caught a frog before.
- I said frogs-- plural.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.171
And it is an art, my friend.
It is not to be taken lightly.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.931
There are ways and means.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.602
Few people know about it.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.056
I'm willing to share my secrets.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.522
Oh, I'm a girl.
You talk to him.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.901
( chuckles ) It's a one-time offer,
bud-- not to be repeated.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.314
Carl:
Why do we need frogs, plural?

06:07.492 --> 06:10.108
- Shane: You ever eat frog legs?
- Eww!

06:10.286 --> 06:13.028
- No, yum!
- No, he's right. Eww.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.663
When you get down
to that last can of beans,

06:15.833 --> 06:17.619
you're gonna be loving
those frog legs, lady.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.002
I can see it now-- "Shane, do you think
I could have a second helping, please?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.914
- Please? Just one?"
- Yeah, I doubt that.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.128
( chuckles )
Don't listen to her, man.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.588
You and me, we'll be heroes.
We'll feed these folks

06:28.763 --> 06:30.628
Cajun-style Kermit legs.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.718
I would rather eat Miss Piggy.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.725
- Yes, that came out wrong.
- ( Shane laughs)

06:35.895 --> 06:38.432
Shane: Heroes, son,
spoken of in song and legend.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.312
You and me, Shane and Carl.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.314
- ( Carl and Shane laugh )
- ( car alarm approaching )

06:42.485 --> 06:45.101
Man:
Hey, Dale, can you see what that is?

06:45.279 --> 06:46.894
Shane:
Talk to me, Dale!

06:47.073 --> 06:50.065
- I can't tell yet.
- Man: Let him get a good look at it.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.454
Is it them? Are they back?

07:00.044 --> 07:01.545
Dale:
I'll be damned.

07:01.712 --> 07:05.045
- Amy: What is it?
- A stolen car is my guess.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.603
- Holy crap. Turn that damn thing off!
- I don't know how!

07:20.773 --> 07:22.434
- Pop the hood, please. Pop the hood.
- My sister Andrea--

07:22.608 --> 07:24.769
- Pop the damn hood, please!
- What? Okay okay. Yeah yeah yeah

07:24.944 --> 07:27.731
- yeah yeah!
- Is she okay? Is she all right?

07:27.905 --> 07:30.066
- Yeah yeah. She's okay! She's okay!
- Is she coming back?

07:30.241 --> 07:32.027
- Glenn: Yes!
- Amy: Why isn't she with you?

07:32.201 --> 07:34.943
- Where is she? She's okay?
- Yes!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.032
Yeah, fine. Everybody is.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.073
Well, Merle not so much.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.162
Are you crazy, driving this
wailing bastard up here?

07:42.336 --> 07:44.042
Are you trying to draw
every walker for miles?

07:44.213 --> 07:47.080
- I think we're okay.
- You call being stupid okay?

07:47.258 --> 07:48.794
Dale: Well, the alarm was
echoing all over these hills.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.129
Hard to pinpoint the source.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.465
I'm not arguing. I'm just saying.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.300
It wouldn't hurt you
to think things through

07:55.475 --> 07:57.431
a little more carefully
next time, would it?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.593
Sorry.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.477
Got a cool car.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.725
(truck approaches )

08:15.495 --> 08:17.656
- Come meet everybody.
- ( engine stops)

08:22.418 --> 08:24.875
(sliding door opens)

08:30.760 --> 08:34.344
- Andrea: Oh!
- Oh my God!

08:34.514 --> 08:37.506
You scared the shit out of me.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.016
- Boy: Papi! Daddy!
- Morales: Hey.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.973
Lori:
Come here, sweetie.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.523
Morales: Hey.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.432
I told you I'd be back, didn't I?

08:50.363 --> 08:53.105
( silent )

08:53.282 --> 08:56.365
( whispers )

08:56.536 --> 08:59.699
- Dale: You are a welcome sight.
-( both laugh )

08:59.872 --> 09:02.830
I thought we had lost
you folks for sure.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.740
How'd y'all get out
of there anyway?

09:04.919 --> 09:08.036
- New guy-- he got us out.
- Shane: New guy?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.170
Morales: Yeah, crazy vato
just got into town.

09:10.341 --> 09:13.799
- Hey, helicopter boy! Come say hello.
- ( truck door opens, shuts)

09:16.055 --> 09:18.216
Morales:
The guy's a cop like you.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.278
Oh my God.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.203
Dad! Dad!

09:43.374 --> 09:44.955
(crying)

09:46.043 --> 09:47.624
Carl.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.420
Oh!

10:26.626 --> 10:26.660
- ( crickets chirping )
- Rick: Disoriented.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.750
- ( crickets chirping )
- Rick: Disoriented.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.002
I guess that comes closest.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.459
Disoriented.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.085
Fear, confusion--
all those things but...

10:39.263 --> 10:40.764
(thunder rumbling)

10:40.931 --> 10:43.308
disoriented comes closest.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.592
Words can be
meager things.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.477
Sometimes they fall short.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.980
Rick: lfelt like I'd been
ripped out of my life

10:51.150 --> 10:53.141
and put somewhere else.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.111
For a while
I thought I was trapped

10:57.281 --> 10:59.488
in some coma dream,

10:59.659 --> 11:02.446
something I might not
wake up from ever.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.495
Mom said you died.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.461
She had every reason
to believe that.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.667
Don't you ever doubt it.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.251
Lori: When things started
to get really bad,

11:20.429 --> 11:22.636
they told me at the hospital that

11:22.807 --> 11:25.970
they were gonna medevac you
and the other patients to Atlanta,

11:27.144 --> 11:29.260
and it never happened.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.895
Well, I'm not surprised
after Atlanta fell.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.728
- Lori: Yeah.
- And from the look of that hospital,

11:34.902 --> 11:36.438
it got overrun.

11:36.612 --> 11:40.400
Yeah, looks don't deceive.
I barely got them out,

11:40.574 --> 11:42.360
you know?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.572
I can't tell you how grateful
I am to you, Shane.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.446
I can't begin to express it.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.200
There go those words
falling short again.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.415
Paltry things.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.048
( wood clatters )

12:04.890 --> 12:08.178
Hey, Ed, you want
to rethink that log?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.217
It's cold, man.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.060
The cold don't change
the rules, does it?

12:16.235 --> 12:20.069
Keep our fires low,
just embers, so we can't be seen

12:20.239 --> 12:22.571
- from a distance, right?
- I said it's cold.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.733
You should mind your own
business for once.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.579
Hey, Ed... ( pats)

12:36.255 --> 12:38.712
( softly ) are you sure you want
to have this conversation, man?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.718
Go on.
Pull the damn thing out.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.425
Go on!

12:49.435 --> 12:51.266
(mmmm)
Chﬁst

12:53.397 --> 12:55.388
(wood thunks, sizzling )

13:06.243 --> 13:09.110
Hey, Carol, Sophia,
how are y'all this evening?

13:09.288 --> 13:12.121
- Fine. We're just fine.
- Shane: Okay.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.824
- I'm sorry about the fire.
- Shane: No no no no.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.583
No apology needed.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.794
Y'all have a good night, okay?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.456
Thank you.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.796
I appreciate the cooperation.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.393
(Shane sighs)

13:34.563 --> 13:37.054
Dale: Have you given
any thought to Daryl Dixon?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.940
He won't be happy to hear
his brother was left behind.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.147
I'll tell him.
I dropped the key. It's on me.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.062
l cuffed him.
That makes it mine.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.731
Glenn:
Guys, it's not a competition.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.570
I don't mean to bring race into this,

13:48.744 --> 13:50.951
but it might sound better
coming from a white guy.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.156
I did what I did.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.495
Hell if I'm gonna hide from him.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.628
- We could lie.
- Or tell the truth.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.039
Merle was out of control.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.129
Something had to be done
or he'd have gotten us killed.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.094
Your husband did
what was necessary.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.675
And if Merle got left behind,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.841
it is nobody's fault but Merle's.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.270
And that's what we tell Daryl?

14:17.147 --> 14:19.524
I don't see a rational discussion

14:19.692 --> 14:21.774
to be had from that, do you?

14:24.572 --> 14:26.108
Word to the wise--

14:27.283 --> 14:28.864
we're gonna have our hands full

14:29.034 --> 14:30.695
when he gets back from his hunt.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.826
T-Dog:
l was scared and I ran.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.207
- I'm not ashamed of it.
- Andrea: We were all scared.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.834
We all ran. What's your point?

14:41.005 --> 14:43.087
I stopped long enough
to chain that door.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.673
Staircase is narrow.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.301
Maybe half a dozen geeks
can squeeze against it

14:49.471 --> 14:51.211
at any one time.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.631
It's not enough
to break through that--

14:53.809 --> 14:55.891
not that chain, not that padlock.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.681
My point-- Dixon's alive

15:01.859 --> 15:04.771
and he's still up there,
handcuffed on that roof.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.736
That's on us.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.337
I found you, didn't I?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.086
I love you, Dad.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.754
I love you, Carl.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.136
I found you both.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.922
- Lori: Yeah.
- ( thunder rumbling)

16:20.521 --> 16:22.182
I knew I would.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.478
You're getting cocky now,
a little bit.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.938
No. No, I knew.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.648
Walking into our home,
finding an empty house,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.657
- both of you gone.
- I'm so sorry.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.911
I knew you were alive.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.824
How?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.869
The photos were gone,

16:47.047 --> 16:49.163
all our family albums.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.557
( chuckles )

17:12.531 --> 17:14.362
I told you so.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.024
Now you're getting cocky, huh?

17:17.202 --> 17:18.703
A lot.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.375
It belongs in here.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.596
Baby, I really thought
I would never see you again.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.936
I'm so sorry...

17:51.403 --> 17:53.064
for everything.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.864
| feel like--

17:58.035 --> 18:00.151
when you were
in the hospital, ljust--

18:00.329 --> 18:02.069
I wanted to take it all back--

18:02.247 --> 18:04.659
the anger and the bad times.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.324
But the mistakes--

18:10.756 --> 18:12.917
Maybe we got a second chance.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.253
Not many people get that.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.310
I wondered where that went.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.572
Do you want it back?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.484
Of course.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.731
( rain pattering )

19:28.292 --> 19:30.283
He won't wake up.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.382
(thunder rumbling)

20:13.712 --> 20:15.873
( bugs chittering )

20:16.048 --> 20:18.039
( kids playing )

20:31.313 --> 20:33.599
( people chatting )

20:33.774 --> 20:35.310
- Morning.
- Man: Morning.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.525
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.855
- Carol: Morning.
- Morning.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.273
They're still a little damp.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.736
The sun'll have 'em
dry in no time.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.869
- You washed my clothes?
- Well, best we could.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.245
Scrubbing on a washboard

20:50.415 --> 20:52.497
ain't half as good
as my old Maytag back home.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.579
That's very kind.
Thank you.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.422
- ( tools clanging )
- Look at 'em.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.674
Vultures.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.709
Yeah, go on, strip it clean.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.628
Generators need every drop
of fuel they can get.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.015
Got no power without it.
Sorry, Glenn.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.927
Thought I'd get to drive it
at least a few more days.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.347
Maybe we'll get to steal
another one someday.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.270
Lori:
Morning, officer.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.279
Rick: Hey.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.990
You sleep okay?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.452
Better than in a long time.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.127
( chuckles )

21:36.295 --> 21:39.833
Well, I didn't want to wake you.
I figured you could use it.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.463
- God. What?
- I've been thinking

21:45.637 --> 21:47.923
about the man we left behind.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.841
You're not serious.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.470
( car approaches )

22:01.653 --> 22:02.984
Water's here, y'all.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.737
Just a reminder to boil before use.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.826
Are you asking me or telling me?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.832
- Asking.
- Well, I think it's crazy.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.164
I think it is just
the stupidest way

22:20.339 --> 22:21.670
- to break your son--
- ( woman screams )

22:21.840 --> 22:23.125
- Carl: Mom!
- Carl?

22:23.300 --> 22:24.460
Man:
It's over there!

22:24.634 --> 22:25.840
- Carl: Dad!
- Lori: Baby!

22:26.011 --> 22:28.297
- Girl: Mama! Mommy!
- Glenn: Rick!

22:28.472 --> 22:30.337
-Loﬁ:Caﬂ!
- Man: Over here! Come on, come on!

22:30.515 --> 22:32.892
Lori:
Carl! Baby!

22:33.060 --> 22:35.016
- Carl: Mom!
- Lori: You're okay! I've got him.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.143
Nothing bit you?
Nothing scratched you?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.474
- No, I'm okay.
- ( cans rattle )

22:48.325 --> 22:50.316
(growling)

23:01.254 --> 23:03.040
( gasps )

23:14.810 --> 23:16.675
(men grunting)

23:35.872 --> 23:37.908
It's the first one
we've had up here.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.244
They never come this far
up the mountain.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.001
Well, they're running out
of food in the city, that's what.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.416
-( branch snaps)
- ( footsteps )

24:05.360 --> 24:09.228
- Oh, Jesus.
- Man: Son of a bitch.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.731
That's my deer!

24:14.828 --> 24:16.739
Look at it.
All gnawed on by this...

24:16.913 --> 24:18.778
( kicking )
filthy, disease-bearing,

24:18.957 --> 24:21.699
motherless poxy bastard!

24:21.877 --> 24:23.287
Calm down, son.
That's not helping.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.952
What do you know
about it, old man?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.792
Why don't you take that stupid hat
and go back to "On Golden Pond"?

24:27.966 --> 24:31.629
I've been tracking
this deer for miles.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.634
Gonna drag it back to camp,

24:33.805 --> 24:35.761
cook us up some venison.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.763
What do you think?
Do you think we can cut around

24:37.934 --> 24:39.310
this chewed up part
right here?

24:39.478 --> 24:40.934
I would not risk that.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.595
( sighs )
That's a damn shame.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.264
I got some squirrel--
about a dozen or so.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.150
That'll have to do.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.153
Oh God.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.903
Come on, people.
What the hell?

25:06.546 --> 25:08.332
It's gotta be the brain.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.589
Don't y'all know nothing?

25:19.184 --> 25:20.515
Merle!

25:22.354 --> 25:25.767
Merle! Get your ugly ass out here!

25:26.942 --> 25:28.352
I got us some squirrel!

25:28.527 --> 25:30.313
Let's stew 'em up.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.405
Shane: Daryl, just slow up a bit.
I need to talk to you.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.697
Daryl:
About what?

25:39.871 --> 25:42.032
Shane:
About Merle.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.663
There was a--

25:43.833 --> 25:45.824
there was a problem in Atlanta.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.671
He dead?

25:57.055 --> 25:59.091
Shane:
We're not sure.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.222
He either is or he ain't!

26:01.393 --> 26:03.884
No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.221
- Who are you?
- Rick Grimes.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.812
Rick Grimes, you got something
you want to tell me?

26:10.986 --> 26:12.897
Your brother was
a danger to us all,

26:13.071 --> 26:16.029
so I handcuffed him on a roof,
hooked him to a piece of metal.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.315
He's still there.

26:18.493 --> 26:22.077
Hold on.
Let me process this.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.114
You're saying you handcuffed
my brother to a roof

26:25.292 --> 26:26.828
and you left him there?!

26:27.002 --> 26:28.913
Yeah.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.881
- ( grunts)
- Hey.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.587
Watch the knife!

26:37.762 --> 26:39.548
(shouts, grunting )

26:42.100 --> 26:43.886
Shane:
Okay. Okay.

26:44.060 --> 26:47.223
- You'd best let me go!
- Nah, I think it's better if I don't.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.353
(Daryl grunting)
Choke hold's illegal.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.185
Shane:
You can file a complaint.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.190
Come on, man.
We'll keep this up all day.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.270
I'd like to have
a calm discussion on this topic.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.314
Do you think
we can manage that?

26:59.492 --> 27:02.655
- Do you think we can manage that?
- Shane: Hmm?

27:03.830 --> 27:05.616
Mmm. Yeah.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.076
( Daryl panting )

27:08.251 --> 27:10.628
What I did was not on a whim.

27:10.795 --> 27:14.754
Your brother does not work
and play well with others.

27:14.924 --> 27:18.712
It's not Rick's fault. I had the key.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.424
- I dropped it.
- You couldn't pick it up?

27:21.598 --> 27:24.010
Well, I dropped it
in a drain.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.019
If it's supposed to make me
feel better, it don't.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.604
T-Dog:
Well, maybe this will.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.565
Look, | chained
the door to the roof--

27:37.739 --> 27:39.320
so the geeks couldn't
get at him--

27:39.491 --> 27:43.234
- with a padlock.
- It's gotta count for something.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.615
Hell with all y'all!

27:50.794 --> 27:52.955
Just tell me where he is

27:53.129 --> 27:54.994
so's I can go get him.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.630
Lori:
He'll show you.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.632
Isn't that right?

28:05.975 --> 28:07.966
I'm going back.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.017
(sighs)

28:25.036 --> 28:26.822
So that's it, huh?

28:26.996 --> 28:28.827
You're just gonna walk off?

28:28.998 --> 28:30.704
Just to hell with everybody else?

28:30.875 --> 28:32.615
I'm not saying
to hell with anybody--

28:32.794 --> 28:34.955
notyou,Shane;
Lori least of all.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.291
Shane:
Tell her that.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.673
She knows.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.210
Shane:
Well, look, |--

28:43.388 --> 28:45.379
I don't, okay, Rick?
So could you just--

28:45.557 --> 28:47.468
could you throw me
a bone here, man?

28:47.642 --> 28:49.178
Could you just tell me why?

28:49.352 --> 28:51.513
Why would you risk your life
for a douche bag like Merle Dixon?

28:51.688 --> 28:53.394
Daryl: Hey, choose your words
more carefully.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.476
No, I did.
Douche bag's what I meant.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.481
Merle Dixon--

28:57.652 --> 29:00.189
the guy wouldn't give you a glass
of water if you were dying of thirst.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.069
Rick: What he would
or wouldn't do doesn't interest me.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.652
I can't let a man
die of thirst-- me.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.942
Thirst and exposure.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.577
We left him like
an animal caught in a trap.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.034
That's no way for anything to die,
let alone a human being.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.085
So you and Daryl,
that's your big plan?

29:20.925 --> 29:22.586
Oh, come on.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.877
You know the way.
You've been there before--

29:25.054 --> 29:27.340
in and out, no problem.
You said so yourself.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.556
It's not fair of me to ask--
I know that--

29:30.727 --> 29:32.137
but I'd feel a lot better
with you along.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.098
I know she would too.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.435
That's just great. Now you're
gonna risk three men, huh?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.941
- T-Dog: Four.
- ( huffs )

29:40.111 --> 29:42.102
My day just gets better
and better, don't it?

29:42.280 --> 29:44.191
T-Dog: You see anybody else
here stepping up

29:44.365 --> 29:47.402
- to save your brother's cracker ass?
- Why you?

29:47.577 --> 29:48.942
T-Dog: You wouldn't even
begin to understand.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.827
- You don't speak my language.
- Dale: That's four.

29:51.998 --> 29:55.286
lt's notjust four. You're putting
every single one of us at risk.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.917
Just know that, Rick.
Come on, you saw that walker.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.588
It was here.
It was in camp.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.087
They're moving out of the cities.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.997
They come back, we need
every able body we've got.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.791
We need 'em here.
We need 'em to protect camp.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.960
It seems to me what
you really need most here

30:08.097 --> 30:12.215
- are more guns.
- Right, the guns.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.133
- Wait. What guns?
- Six shotguns,

30:14.312 --> 30:17.179
two high-powered rifles,
over a dozen handguns.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.769
I cleaned out the cage
back at the station before I left.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.480
I dropped the bag
in Atlanta when I got swarmed.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.270
It's just sitting there on the street,
waiting to be picked up.

30:25.448 --> 30:29.862
- Ammo?
- 700 rounds, assorted.

30:30.036 --> 30:32.823
Lori: You went through
hell to find us.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.989
You just got here and you're gonna
turn around and leave?

30:37.168 --> 30:39.375
Dad, I don't want you to go.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.335
To hell with the guns.
Shane is right.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.500
Merle Dixon?

30:46.678 --> 30:50.011
He's not worth one of your lives,
even with guns thrown in.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.548
Tell me.
Make me understand.

30:53.726 --> 30:58.186
I owe a debt to a man
I met and his little boy.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.688
Lori, if they hadn't
taken me in,

31:00.859 --> 31:02.690
I'd have died.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.477
It's because of them
that I made it back to you at all.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.896
They said they'd
follow me to Atlanta.

31:08.074 --> 31:10.531
They'll walk into the same trap
I did if I don't warn him.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.035
What's stopping you?

31:14.205 --> 31:16.912
The walkie-talkie,
the one in the bag I dropped.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.416
He's got the other one. Our plan was
to connect when they got closer.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.420
- These are our walkies?
- Yeah.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.421
So use the CB.
What's wrong with that?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.378
The CB's fine.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.292
It's the walkies
that suck to crap--

31:29.470 --> 31:32.052
date back to the '70s,
don't match any other bandwidth--

31:32.223 --> 31:33.929
not even the scanners
in our cars.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.552
I need that bag.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.774
Okay?

31:57.582 --> 31:59.538
All right.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.669
- ( truck beeping )
- Rumor is you have bolt cutters.

32:07.508 --> 32:11.046
- Maybe.
- T-Dog: Yeah, we get to that roof,

32:11.220 --> 32:13.962
we'll need to cut that chain
and the handcuffs.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.306
I never like lending tools.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.058
The last time I did--

32:19.228 --> 32:21.264
and yes, I am talking
about you--

32:21.439 --> 32:23.600
let's just say your bag of guns

32:23.775 --> 32:25.436
wasn't the only bag
that was dropped.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.067
My tools got
left behind with Merle.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.102
Rick:
We'll bring your tools back too.

32:30.281 --> 32:33.569
Think of the bolt cutters
as an investment.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.243
Sounds like more of a gamble.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.874
- What do | get in return?
- Rick: What do you want?

32:47.048 --> 32:48.663
How about one of those guns
you bring back?

32:48.841 --> 32:51.093
- My pick.
- Done.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.093
( man clears throat )
Dale, let's...

32:54.263 --> 32:56.299
sweeten the deal a bit.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.976
Now that cube van of yours--

32:59.143 --> 33:01.134
What about it?

33:01.312 --> 33:03.428
The RV's radiator hose is shot.

33:03.606 --> 33:07.019
That's a problem if we need to get
somewhere and wanna get very far.

33:07.193 --> 33:10.777
And the hose on that van is
just about a perfect match--

33:10.947 --> 33:12.778
well, enough that I can make it fit.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.814
I'll tell you what-- we get back,

33:14.993 --> 33:18.451
you can strip that van down
to the bare metal.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.998
(truck honks)

33:21.165 --> 33:23.872
- Come on, let's go!
- Thank you.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.583
Hey, Rick,
got any rounds in the Python?

33:34.137 --> 33:35.172
No.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.802
Last time we were
on the gun range,

33:36.973 --> 33:40.215
I'm sure I wound up
with a few loose rounds of yours.

33:41.811 --> 33:44.848
You and that bag--
like the bottom of an old lady's purse.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.479
I hate that you're doing this, man.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.026
I think that
it's foolish and reckless.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.570
But if you're gonna go,
you're taking bullets.

33:51.738 --> 33:55.026
I'm not sure I'd want
to fire a shot in the city,

33:55.199 --> 33:57.736
- not after what happened last time.
- That's up to you.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.739
Well...

34:03.416 --> 34:05.532
four men, four rounds.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.497
What are the odds, huh?

34:09.672 --> 34:11.253
Well, let's just hope that--

34:11.424 --> 34:14.086
let's just hope that four is
your lucky number, okay?

34:15.344 --> 34:18.006
- Thank you.
- All right.

34:32.695 --> 34:36.062
(truck starts, rewing )

34:48.586 --> 34:51.328
Hey.
(sniffling )

34:51.506 --> 34:53.337
You know,
I bet they'll be just fine.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.545
I'm not worried.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.962
Are you?

35:03.559 --> 35:05.550
Yeah, a little.

35:06.729 --> 35:08.139
Don't be.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.768
- Why?
- Think about it, Mom.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.559
Everything that's
happened to him so far--

35:15.613 --> 35:17.353
nothing's killed him yet.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.193
( chuckles )

35:34.799 --> 35:36.460
Daryl:
He'd better be okay.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.625
It's my only word on the matter.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.543
I told you the geeks
can't get at him.

35:40.721 --> 35:44.464
The only thing that's gonna
get through that door is us.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.348
-( brakes squeak)
- ( gear shift clicks)

35:46.519 --> 35:49.352
- ( engine stops)
- We walk from here.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.823
Lori: Dale.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.460
- Have you seen Carl?
- Shane took him down to the quarry.

36:14.630 --> 36:17.838
There was some mighty bold talk
about catching frogs.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.005
(women chatting )

36:27.977 --> 36:29.808
Carl:
I'm not getting anything.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.765
Yeah.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.021
Being all wily,
staying submerged.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.978
Little suckers,
they know something's up.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.483
That's what's going on.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.520
Just going to have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.200
All right, little man, look.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.744
You are the-- you are
the key in all this, okay?

36:45.912 --> 36:47.868
All I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go after one of them,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.200
all right, scare the rest of them off.
They're all gonna scatter.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.239
- I'm gonna drive 'em your way, okay?
- All right.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.533
What you need to do
is you need to round up

36:53.711 --> 36:55.702
every bad boy you see,
all right? Are you with me?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.541
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hells yeah. Give me your mean face.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.421
- ( both growl )
- Yes sir. Are you ready?

36:59.592 --> 37:00.923
- Yeah!
- Are you ready? Here we go, boy.

37:01.093 --> 37:02.879
Here we go.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.391
- ( laughing )
- All right, they're coming your way.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.021
They're coming your way.
Go on, get 'em, get 'em.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.398
They're coming
your way, come on.

37:17.568 --> 37:20.230
Catch them frogs.
Catch them frogs.

37:20.404 --> 37:23.191
They're coming, little man! Get 'em!
Get that net in there and get 'em!

37:23.366 --> 37:27.109
I'm beginning to question
the division of labor here.

37:27.286 --> 37:29.698
They're coming, little man! Get 'em!
Get that net in there and get 'em!

37:29.872 --> 37:32.739
What have you got, bad boy?
What do you got? What do you got?

37:32.917 --> 37:35.704
- Dirt.
- Oh boy.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.118
All right, we've got to start over.

37:37.296 --> 37:40.880
- Come on, let's find this bucket.
- ( both laughing )

37:41.050 --> 37:42.915
Can someone explain to me
how the women wound up

37:43.094 --> 37:44.254
doing all the Hattie McDaniel work?

37:44.428 --> 37:46.885
The world ended.
Didn't you get the memo?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.633
It's just the way it is.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.812
( fence clatters )

38:02.863 --> 38:05.275
- Merle first or guns?
- Merle! We ain't even having

38:05.449 --> 38:07.485
- this conversation.
- ( emphatically ) We are.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.116
You know the geography.
It's your call.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.245
Merle's closest.
The guns would mean doubling back.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.030
Merle first.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.873
(scrubbing )

38:18.045 --> 38:20.582
Carol:
I do miss my Maytag.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.042
I miss my Benz, my sat nav.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.756
I miss my coffeemaker

38:27.930 --> 38:29.670
with that dual-drip filter

38:29.849 --> 38:32.056
and built-in grinder, honey.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.727
My computer...

38:33.894 --> 38:35.555
and texting.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.937
I miss my vibrator.

38:38.107 --> 38:40.439
Jacqui: Oh!

38:40.609 --> 38:43.271
- ( women laugh )
- Amy: Oh my God!

38:46.198 --> 38:48.610
- Me too.
- ( women laughing louder)

38:53.956 --> 38:55.992
What's so funny?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.249
Just swapping war stories, Ed.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.873
Yeah.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.123
(water dripping)

39:12.516 --> 39:14.302
Andrea:
Problem, Ed?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.051
Nothin' that concerns you.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.846
And you ought to focus
on your work.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.562
- This ain't no comedy club.
- ( Andrea huffs )

39:26.530 --> 39:28.316
Hey, Carl,

39:28.491 --> 39:30.652
what did I tell you about
not leaving Dale's sight?

39:30.826 --> 39:33.238
But Shane said we could
catch frogs, remember?

39:33.412 --> 39:35.277
It doesn't matter what Shane says.
It matters what I say.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.947
- Go on back to camp.
- ( sighs)

39:38.125 --> 39:40.116
Lori:
I'll be right behind you.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.545
I've got to tell you,

39:45.716 --> 39:47.581
I do not think you should be
taking this out on him.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.876
Lori: You don't tell me what to do.
You lost that privilege.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.887
Lori, could you just wait up a sec?
I think we should talk.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.217
- We haven't had a chance--
- No. No no.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.223
That's over too.
You can tell that to the frogs.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.134
Damn it, Lori. Look, I don't know
how it appears to you

39:58.312 --> 40:00.098
- or what you think--
- How it appears to me? I'm sorry.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.809
Is there a gray area here?
Let me dispel it.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.939
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my son.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.976
You don't look at him.
You don't talk to him.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.736
From now on,
my family is off-limits to you.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.907
Lori, I don't think that's fair.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.036
- Shane, shut up. Don't! (slapping )
- I don't think that--

40:17.206 --> 40:20.573
My husband is back.
He is alive.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.367
He's my best friend.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.253
Do you think
I'm not happy about that?

40:26.424 --> 40:28.415
How dare you?
Why would you be?

40:28.592 --> 40:31.925
You are the one that
told me that he died.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.888
You son of a bitch.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.564
( shuffling footsteps )

40:53.492 --> 40:56.108
(growling)

41:03.085 --> 41:06.828
Damn. You are one ugly skank.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.295
(thuds)

41:26.609 --> 41:28.600
(scrubbing )

41:32.448 --> 41:33.688
Ed, tell you what--

41:33.866 --> 41:35.652
you don't like how
your laundry is done,

41:35.826 --> 41:38.989
you are welcome to pitch in
and do it yourself. Here.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.825
- Oh!
- Ed: Ain't my job, missy.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.990
- Andrea, don't.
- What is yourjob, Ed?

41:44.168 --> 41:45.874
Sitting on your ass
smoking cigarettes?

41:46.045 --> 41:47.125
Well, it sure as hell
ain't listening

41:47.296 --> 41:48.581
to some uppity
smart-mouthed bitch.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.964
Tell you what--
come on. Let's go.

41:52.134 --> 41:54.125
I don't think she needs
to go anywhere with you, Ed.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.339
And I say it's none of your business.
Come on now.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.345
- You heard me.
- Carol.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.507
Andrea, please.
It doesn't matter.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.175
Hey, don't think
I won't knock you on your ass

42:03.354 --> 42:05.015
just 'cause you're some
college-educated cooze,

42:05.189 --> 42:06.679
- All right?
- ( gasps )

42:06.857 --> 42:09.348
Now you come on now
or you gonna regret it later.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.688
So she can show up
with fresh bruises later, Ed?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.693
- Yeah, we've seen them.
- ( laughs )

42:13.864 --> 42:15.900
Stay out of this.
Now come on!

42:16.075 --> 42:18.361
You know what?
This ain't none of y'all's business.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.993
You don't want to keep prodding
the bull here, okay?

42:21.163 --> 42:23.540
Now I am done talking.
Come on.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.823
- No no. Carol, you don't have--
- ( Carol mutters )

42:26.001 --> 42:28.333
You don't tell me what!
ltell you what!

42:28.504 --> 42:30.495
( clamoring )

42:30.673 --> 42:32.584
- You think you can--
- Amy: Get off her!

42:32.758 --> 42:34.419
- Ed: Come here! Come here!
- Amy: Get off her!

42:34.593 --> 42:37.175
- Get off her! Get off her!
- Ed: Get off me!

42:37.346 --> 42:39.428
-( Ed grunting)
- Carol: Ed?

42:39.598 --> 42:41.714
- Amy: It's okay. It's okay.
- Carol: No!

42:42.893 --> 42:44.349
- It's okay.
- No!

42:55.864 --> 42:57.855
- ( women yelling)
- Amy: Shane, stop!

42:58.033 --> 42:59.443
Just stop!

43:00.619 --> 43:02.996
Carol:
Stop it!

43:03.163 --> 43:04.994
- Stop!
- You put your hands on your wife,

43:05.165 --> 43:06.951
your little girl
or anybody else in this camp

43:07.126 --> 43:09.333
one more time, I will not stop
next time. Do you hear me?

43:09.503 --> 43:11.243
- Do you hear me?!
- ( slurs ) Yes.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.128
- l'll beat you to death, Ed.
- Carol: Ed!

43:13.299 --> 43:15.915
- l'll beat you to death.
- ( Carol crying ) Oh God!

43:16.093 --> 43:17.458
No.

43:17.636 --> 43:20.093
- God!
- ( grunts)

43:21.307 --> 43:24.094
(crying )
Ed, I'm sorry.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.931
Oh my God. Ed, I'm sorry.

43:29.064 --> 43:31.931
I'm so sorry, Ed.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.521
Ed, I'm sorry.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.811
- I'm sorry, Ed.
- ( coughing )

43:43.412 --> 43:45.243
( chain rattles )
