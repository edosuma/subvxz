I want you to know that I wish
things could be different.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.053
If you look at anything
from far enough away,

00:54.054 --> 00:57.423

00:57.424 --> 01:02.061
In the universe, in
nature, in life...

01:02.062 --> 01:06.065
especially even in death.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.601
The trouble is, when
you're inside the pattern,

01:09.602 --> 01:14.206
you just can't see it.

01:14.207 --> 01:18.078

Okay...

Are you okay, man?

04:26.132 --> 04:27.667
I've been worse.

Buddy!

Hey!

04:44.284 --> 04:48.187
Hello!

Ben!

05:04.404 --> 05:08.807
Ben...

05:08.808 --> 05:11.777
Ben... can you tell me
how you're feeling?

05:11.778 --> 05:14.413
That's kind of a personal
question, don't you think?

05:14.414 --> 05:18.317
I know you think you're being
funny but you're just not.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.019
The puppet thinks I'm hilarious.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.323
I think you're avoiding
the real problem.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.492
What do you want me to say?

05:27.493 --> 05:29.361
I... I hit a rough patch
but now I'm better.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.496
It's only been six months
and what did we say

05:31.497 --> 05:33.165
about definitive statements?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.701
You know I started
making this collage?

05:35.702 --> 05:38.770
It's about my past,
about my parents,

05:38.771 --> 05:41.206
me being an only child...

05:41.207 --> 05:45.510
meeting Claire, losing Claire...

05:45.511 --> 05:47.379
I made it out of string.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.349
It's very tactile.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.217
And why are you doing this?

05:52.218 --> 05:55.287
Oh, just trying to figure out
where my life went wrong.

05:55.288 --> 05:59.324
Can I ask you a question?

05:59.325 --> 06:01.226
Do you like yourself?

06:01.227 --> 06:04.496
What, as a friend?

06:04.497 --> 06:12.497
Or... more of a...
friend with benefits?

06:12.839 --> 06:16.375
Ben... I'm a child psychologist.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.379
You shouldn't even be in here.

Okay, just...

06:27.354 --> 06:28.420
Hi there, Alexa.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.021
Are your parents still
getting divorced?

06:30.022 --> 06:32.422
I don't know, is that guy still
having sex with your ex-wife?

06:32.446 --> 06:34.559
How did you know that?

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
Everybody knows.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.262
Braden F said you're a cry-baby.

06:37.263 --> 06:38.764
Well Braden F wets the bed.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.499
Are you going to trust
whatever he says?

06:40.500 --> 06:41.334
You're a cry-baby.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.335
How do you like that?

06:42.336 --> 06:43.336
Okay, that's enough!

06:43.336 --> 06:44.270
Everyone, just...

06:44.271 --> 06:45.704
Yeah, you'd better run.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.373
Does this look like
running to you?

06:48.374 --> 06:50.242
Does this?

06:50.243 --> 06:53.345
I'm walking away 'cause
I have things to do.

Shoot.

Uh..

07:38.459 --> 07:39.925
What, what'd you say?

07:39.926 --> 07:41.660
What kind of narcissist
wears a shirt

07:41.661 --> 07:44.496
with their own picture on it?

07:44.497 --> 07:47.332
Oh, uh... yeah I, I
bought this at a store.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.400
It's, it's not me.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.302
Mmm, it really is.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.339
It's like a weird, colorful
little version of you.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.608
Self portrait of a man named...?

Ben.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.983
Yeah.

You don't get migraines, do you?

08:06.352 --> 08:07.686
No.

08:07.687 --> 08:08.921
No Imitrex, no Migard, I know.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.927
It's, uh... it's for
a skin condition.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.663
Mmm, I got that same condition.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.032
It's a real bitch
around the holidays.

08:21.033 --> 08:25.637
You should take my number.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.472
Paper?

08:27.473 --> 08:31.344
Uh... okay.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.015
You have messy handwriting.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.049
Tough shit.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.586
You should call me.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.825
Cash or credit?

08:46.826 --> 08:52.865
Uh... cash.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.516
Don't be mad.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.351
- Oh, geez!
- I got bored.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.520
Tabby, what the hell,
what are you doing here?

09:48.521 --> 09:49.688
I'm cleaning.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.423
I'm being a good neighbor.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.557
You're welcome!

09:52.558 --> 09:53.678
Did you throw out my plants?

09:53.702 --> 09:54.960
They were dying.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.429
Well, we're all dying.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.631
Usually when I do this
you don't even notice.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.099
I'm pretty stealthy.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.568
I think I need my spare
key back from you.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.437
Well, I disagree.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.739
Okay... all right.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.642
By the way, uh... what is this?

10:10.643 --> 10:11.611
I hate it.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.445
Oh, thank you so much.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.581
Uh... that is my life.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.484
So I guess you kind
of hate my life,

10:19.485 --> 10:21.453
that makes two of us.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.755
I decided to lay
it out visually,

10:23.756 --> 10:27.659
you know so I can see
what went wrong.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.628
Can I just...?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.161
No, no, no, no, no, no...

10:30.162 --> 10:31.963
But it's a mess.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.467
Yeah, I know.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.837
I've been reading some books
about parallel universes,

10:38.838 --> 10:42.774
quantum physics, stuff like
that and how every choice

10:42.775 --> 10:46.811
we make creates thousands
of universes spreading

10:46.812 --> 10:51.683
throughout time and space.

10:51.684 --> 10:55.487
Okay, uh, well let me
give you an example.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.788
Okay. So...

10:56.789 --> 11:01.159
let's say that this
line here is my life,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.827
what was supposed to be my life.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.497
Like, it's quiet, it's
peaceful, it's serene,

11:05.498 --> 11:09.668
it's happy... and then
something happened here.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.772
And now my life is on
this alternate reality

11:13.773 --> 11:16.875
which is shit and I can't
come back from it at all.

11:16.876 --> 11:21.513
So, if I just figure
what this is...

11:21.514 --> 11:23.582
well, then hopefully
I can fix it.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.985
That's permanent
marker, you know?

11:26.986 --> 11:29.922
That's not coming out.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.794
What?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.830
God damnit... is all of it?

11:38.831 --> 11:41.067
Shit.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.919
Hello?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.687
Yes, this is his son.

12:02.688 --> 12:05.624
Who's this?

12:10.564 --> 12:11.564
He's not dead.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.666
Are you sure?

12:17.571 --> 12:18.571
Where am I?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.105
Sir, you've had a heart attack.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.774
Don't tell my son, he's
not good in a crisis.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.175
Dad I'm here, it's me.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.011
Good, listen...

12:27.012 --> 12:28.947
I have to tell you
something in case I die.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.068
You're, you're not going to
die, I don't think, right?

12:31.092 --> 12:31.683
Is he?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.918
Oh, he'll be fine probably.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.854
Just shut up for one minute.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.021
It's about your sister.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.022
Dad, I don't have
a sister, okay?

12:38.023 --> 12:39.023
I'm an only child.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.304
How many drugs did you give him?

12:40.328 --> 12:41.926
No, we didn't give
him any drugs.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.796
Okay, well... well
maybe, should you?

12:44.797 --> 12:46.117
I mean he just had
a heart attack.

12:46.118 --> 12:47.438
Do you want to be
the doctor here?

12:47.462 --> 12:48.933
- No, no, no...
- Ben...

12:48.934 --> 12:55.774
before you were born, your
mother and I, we... adopted.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.055
Then after it went
through, well,

12:57.079 --> 12:59.744
your mother discovered
that she was pregnant.

12:59.745 --> 13:03.281
So, so... we had to
give up the freebie.

13:03.282 --> 13:07.652
So... I almost had a sister?

13:07.653 --> 13:08.653
Are you sure?

13:08.654 --> 13:10.155
Yeah, yes I'm sure.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.091
I held this baby in my arms
and she was cuter than you!

13:13.092 --> 13:15.160
All right, irrelevant, but yeah...
okay.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.129
Ben... she's out
there somewhere.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.799
Just listen to me, damnit.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.069
Ben, she's still out there!

13:25.070 --> 13:29.007
Uh... okay, uh...
what do I do now?

13:29.008 --> 13:33.212
Just go home, we'll call you
after his surgery... probably.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.926
Well, of course we
applied for adoption!

13:47.927 --> 13:49.694
From what the doctors say,

13:49.695 --> 13:52.130
my uterus is pretty
much a death trap.

13:52.131 --> 13:55.834
Besides, I wasn't getting any
younger so it made sense.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.336
Okay, then what happened?

13:58.337 --> 14:01.840
Well... found out I was up
the duff on the same day

14:01.841 --> 14:04.108
they brought the baby.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.878
You can't adopt if you've
got one in the oven.

14:06.879 --> 14:11.015
So... if you'd got the baby home
a little bit sooner or found out

14:11.016 --> 14:12.951
you were pregnant a
little bit later...

14:12.952 --> 14:15.887
You would have had a sister.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.723
Even had a name
picked out for her.

14:18.724 --> 14:23.194
Would've called her
Wendy, after my mother.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.899
Wait... I thought this
was a picture of me.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.338
Okay, uh... so, uh...

14:33.339 --> 14:35.039
what happened to the baby?

14:35.040 --> 14:40.378
Beats me, probably shipped her
off to some other family.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.714
So, she's really out there...

14:42.715 --> 14:43.955
with this whole different life.

14:43.979 --> 14:45.219
She doesn't even know about me,

14:45.243 --> 14:47.819
she doesn't even really
know about herself!

14:47.820 --> 14:48.853
Benny?

14:48.854 --> 14:50.021
What's this all about?

14:50.022 --> 14:51.723
I could've almost had a sister,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.424
do you know how
formative that is?

14:53.425 --> 14:55.226
I'm going to find this girl

14:55.227 --> 14:56.667
and I'm going to see
what she's like,

14:56.668 --> 14:58.228
I've got to know what
I've been missing.

14:58.252 --> 14:59.264
But... I don't know,

14:59.265 --> 15:00.932
it's never a good
idea to mess around

15:00.933 --> 15:02.934
in someone else's past.

15:02.935 --> 15:06.204
Well... good thing for someone
else, this is my past

15:06.205 --> 15:09.774
and I'm going to mess
around with it just fine.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.978
And also, you should call Dad,
he almost died this morning.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.281
Again?

15:16.282 --> 15:18.350
♪

16:04.430 --> 16:06.064
Tabby?

16:06.065 --> 16:07.966
Hey, is uh, is Tabby here?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.400
Tabby?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.069
That guy is here, the
one that looks like

16:11.070 --> 16:13.905
a sad cartoon carrot.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.074
Uh... That doesn't
even make any sense.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.077
Uh, yeah... Tabby look, look...

16:19.078 --> 16:20.144
my whole life is a lie.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.479
I'm sure that's not the case.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.014
It is.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.083
My parent's were going
to adopt, but didn't.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.084
I almost had a sister!

16:26.085 --> 16:29.454
I need you to help me.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.189
Okay, but I'm at work right now.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.824
Yeah, we're going to leave here.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.293
Okay, we're going to go break
into an adoption agency

16:35.294 --> 16:37.028
and we're going to
steal a bunch of files

16:37.029 --> 16:41.966
and figure out who this girl is
and see if she can fix my life.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.201
What the fuck?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.482
We are not breaking
the law, Ben!

16:44.506 --> 16:45.837
Ow, why are you hitting me?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.105
Because you're being an idiot.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.440
This here, is not
rational behavior.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.042
No, no, no, it's very rational.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.110
Okay?

16:52.111 --> 16:53.845
This is the only
thing that's left.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.013
This is the thing.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.115
I find her, right...

16:57.116 --> 17:00.051
and then I can figure out
where my life went wrong...

17:00.052 --> 17:02.987
and hopefully
correct everything.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.468
And what if you don't
like the answer?

17:04.492 --> 17:06.858
Then at least I tried.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.059
At least I tried.

17:08.060 --> 17:11.296
Tabby, I am running
out of options here.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.901
Okay.

17:16.902 --> 17:19.237
Fine, uh... if this
is what you need

17:19.238 --> 17:20.039
then I guess I can
help a little.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.040
This is what I need.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.320
But we are not breaking the law.

17:23.345 --> 17:24.042
Okay.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.324
And we're not stealing anything.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.176
Sure.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.345
And you have to promise me

17:27.346 --> 17:28.866
that things are not
going to get weird.

17:28.890 --> 17:30.826
You know I can't
promise you that.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.184
Yeah, I guess.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.286
Yeah... it's already weird.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.889
This all makes sense.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.359
My parents were married for like...
seven years before me.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.194
They probably thought
they'd never have a kid.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.396
Of course they tried
to adopt, of course!

17:45.397 --> 17:46.697
What does it matter?

17:46.698 --> 17:48.533
Your parents adopted a
baby and gave her back.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.934
What does it have
to do with you?

17:49.935 --> 17:51.369
Uh... I don't know Tabby,

17:51.370 --> 17:53.410
maybe because she could've
taught me so many things.

17:53.434 --> 17:55.273
She could've taught me
how to talk to girls

17:55.274 --> 17:56.407
and cool dance moves.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.708
You hate dancing,

17:57.709 --> 17:59.944
it's one of the five
things we have in common.

17:59.945 --> 18:03.014
Yeah, well maybe I would've loved
dancing if I had a sister.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.296
God, I could've learned a trade
skill and lived in a house

18:05.297 --> 18:07.377
with a kid and a wife who
likes to show her cleavage.

18:07.401 --> 18:08.286
Eww!

18:08.287 --> 18:10.122
Top of the tits, Tabby.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.358
This is never going to work.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.194
Okay, that guy's not
going to help us.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.428
No, we're already here.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.063
This was your idea.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.032
Okay... What can I do for you?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.266
Hi there, uh...

18:22.267 --> 18:25.103
well we're looking for the
adoption records of a girl

18:25.104 --> 18:28.606
that was born, uh,
30 years ago and...

18:28.607 --> 18:29.874
we don't have her name

18:29.875 --> 18:32.110
but we do have the name
of the people who, uh,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.979
didn't adopt her.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.447
Uh, you also have a photo.

18:36.448 --> 18:40.018
Oh yeah, I have a... photo.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.256
Okay... my parents had to give
her back when they found out

18:45.257 --> 18:47.425
they were going to have
me and I'm just...

18:47.426 --> 18:50.261
trying to track her
down so I can know

18:50.262 --> 18:52.964
what my life would've been
like if I had a sister.

18:52.965 --> 18:57.301
So, uh... you want me to hand
over the adoption records

18:57.302 --> 18:59.237
of a stranger...

18:59.238 --> 19:03.141
um, because you're having some
kind of emotional crisis?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.176
Basically... yes.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.177
It's a quest.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.745
Yeah, it's a quest.

19:07.746 --> 19:12.984
Okay, there is literally no way
that that's going to happen.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.220
What if I gave you $50?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.089
I'm going to need
your parents names

19:18.090 --> 19:19.250
and the date of the adoption.

19:19.274 --> 19:20.458
Yeah, got it.

19:20.459 --> 19:25.129
That's also... that's
what I also have.

19:25.130 --> 19:25.998
I will be right back. Stay here.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.065
Yeah.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.203
Whoa, okay.

19:32.204 --> 19:35.606
Okay, uh, I need to borrow
50 bucks right now.

19:35.607 --> 19:36.707
Are you serious?

19:36.708 --> 19:38.643
Mmm.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.011
Okay, you have to pay me back.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.213
- Fine.
- Yeah, 'cause it's $50.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.214
Sure.

19:43.215 --> 19:45.083
Damn, I'm good for it.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.390
I had to go to the archives...

19:52.391 --> 19:54.192
Okay, well regardless
I appreciate it,

19:54.193 --> 19:55.326
thank you so much.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.327
This means a lot, I mean
you're a good man, really.

19:57.351 --> 19:59.063
Not really.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.731
I hate this place.

20:00.732 --> 20:01.700
Okay, thank you.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.134
Right on, thank you so much.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.303
Thank you.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.244
Hey... Ben.

20:48.714 --> 20:51.782
You know this isn't going
to make you happy, right?

20:51.783 --> 20:52.783
I know what I'm doing.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.286
You do?

20:55.287 --> 20:57.588
You're wearing a button
down shirt inside out.

20:57.589 --> 21:02.426
Looks to me like you
don't know shit.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.330
Well, what do you know?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.334
Can I help you?

21:43.335 --> 21:45.169
Ah... don't... what
are you doing?

21:45.170 --> 21:46.371
Stop...

21:49.808 --> 21:52.443
You.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.478
I thought you were
going to call me.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.681
What are you doing here, do you...
do you live here?

21:56.682 --> 21:58.449
Have you been following me?

21:58.450 --> 22:00.370
Is that your deal, you
like, follow girls around?

22:00.371 --> 22:01.038
Are you a pervert?

22:01.039 --> 22:02.153
Is your dick hard?

22:02.154 --> 22:04.789
No, no... my dick is... soft.

22:04.790 --> 22:08.326
Like normal.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.428
What are you doing here?

22:10.429 --> 22:13.431
Is your name Hanna Weathers?

22:13.432 --> 22:18.803
That's kind of what I
want to talk about.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.004
Are you on drugs right now?

22:20.005 --> 22:25.509
Look, uh... this is a
quest, I'm on a quest.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.879
Oh... okay.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.681
Then let's talk.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.350
You can buy me a
chicken fried steak.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.453
I know a place close
by, grab your bike.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.889
All right, uh... wait,
did you say, uh...

22:38.890 --> 22:41.859
did you say chicken fried steak?

22:41.860 --> 22:45.896
Yeah, if you get to say "quest,"
I can say "chicken fried steak."

22:45.897 --> 22:47.198
Okay.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.666
It's delicious.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.736
♪

22:57.376 --> 22:59.277
What did you want to talk about?

23:01.213 --> 23:04.248
Okay... uh... first... off...

23:04.249 --> 23:09.420
what do you know
about your parents?

23:09.421 --> 23:10.755
Yare a serial killer.

23:10.756 --> 23:14.258
No, no... no, no I'm not.

23:14.259 --> 23:19.864
Okay well, uh... my parents
tried to adopt a baby.

23:19.865 --> 23:22.767
Uh, they did actually
adopt a baby

23:22.768 --> 23:25.269
but the day they
brought her home,

23:25.270 --> 23:27.405
my mom found out
she was pregnant.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.374
So the agency made her take
the baby back and I...

23:30.375 --> 23:31.742
You almost had a sister.

23:31.743 --> 23:35.546
Yeah, exactly.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.387
Um... but the thing is,
she might not even know

23:37.411 --> 23:39.250
she was adopted.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.284
You know?

23:40.285 --> 23:41.285
Maybe she does.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.420
I always knew.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.256
More coffee?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.291
Uh... no thank you.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.893
Oh, yes please.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.962
Thanks.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.635
So...

23:57.636 --> 24:01.605
Oh, sorry...

24:01.606 --> 24:04.442
Your parents give her back and
instead of being your sister,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.043
this chick, she goes off,

24:06.044 --> 24:08.879
she lives another life, becomes
someone completely different.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.748
Still...

24:09.749 --> 24:11.615
Connected, yeah.

24:11.616 --> 24:15.653
So I tracked down her file and
her name and her address...

24:15.654 --> 24:20.458
and... I think I may
have found her.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.460
So what's the question?

24:22.461 --> 24:25.629
Um... if I should
tell her or not.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.465
You know, if it's worth it...

24:27.466 --> 24:31.902
'cause finding out you're
adopted can be heavy

24:31.903 --> 24:35.473
and I don't know
if it's my place.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.477
Well I think if I was her...

24:39.478 --> 24:41.679
I would want to know
that I had a brother.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.349
I would want to know who he
was, what he was like...

24:45.350 --> 24:48.487
I'd want the chance to
look him in the eye.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.691
Yeah, that's what I thought.

24:57.696 --> 25:01.666
Um... I'll be right
back, I'm sorry.

25:24.676 --> 25:25.956
Do you know where
that girl went?

25:25.957 --> 25:27.792
I don't know.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.676
You know smoking's
bad for you, right?

25:45.677 --> 25:47.044
Well this is electric.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.013
Oh, is that better?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.647
Yeah, I don't get cancer.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.415
Would you rather I got cancer?

25:51.416 --> 25:53.084
I don't know, I
haven't decided yet.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.857
Have you ever heard of
quantum entanglement.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.492
Remind me.

26:01.493 --> 26:04.728
Well these special little
particles are created together...

26:04.729 --> 26:08.999
and then no matter where they
go they're bonded... forever.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.536
Trippy.

26:12.537 --> 26:13.571
I'm the girl.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.439
Right?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.840
I'm not an idiot.

26:16.841 --> 26:20.444
I'm dyslexic and I only read
science fiction, but...

26:20.445 --> 26:21.712
I got street smarts.

26:21.713 --> 26:22.681
Oh yeah.

26:22.682 --> 26:26.684
You were almost my brother...
but not.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.018
Yeah.

26:28.019 --> 26:32.056
What do you, uh... what
do you think about that?

26:32.057 --> 26:33.757
I think there's reason
behind anything

26:33.758 --> 26:35.759
if you look hard enough.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.794
I mean, us meeting...

26:36.795 --> 26:38.796
the way our lives turned out...

26:38.797 --> 26:41.465
worth exploring.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.902
Hey buddy, want a picture?

You can come back in a
bit, I can put it up.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.439
No... I, I don't think so.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.741

Are you like Batman?

28:56.067 --> 28:57.735

Batman would never do that.

super inappropriate. Okay?

wanted to surprise you.

surprises, okay?

wanted to go for a bike ride.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.310
Yes.

connected together

the other is tails.

32:43.261 --> 32:45.095
How?

32:45.096 --> 32:46.830

is it heads or tails?

32:57.075 --> 32:58.241
I don't know.

32:58.242 --> 33:00.110
That's right,
that's uncertainty.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.979
See until we observe it,

33:01.980 --> 33:04.915
the quarter is both
heads and tails.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.018
Like, it's still spinning even
when it's perfectly still.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.987

33:09.988 --> 33:11.154

33:15.927 --> 33:17.494
Still both, uncertain?

33:17.495 --> 33:20.163
Nuh uh, it's heads.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.099
They're always opposite,

33:21.100 --> 33:22.934
they're always entangled.

Okay, what's her type?

39:31.402 --> 39:33.703

39:33.704 --> 39:35.372
How do you know she's thin?

Okay, what's your

do Tabby, so... what is it?

You... you loved her so much.

39:56.227 --> 40:01.364

left I used to watch

40:01.365 --> 40:04.601
the way you were together.

40:04.602 --> 40:11.608
You'd tuck her hair back behind
her ear or kiss her cheek...

40:11.609 --> 40:17.247

to be loved like that.

40:17.248 --> 40:22.552
Yeah, well... that
love wasn't real.

40:22.553 --> 40:25.855
You know?

40:25.856 --> 40:27.858
Yeah.

40:33.764 --> 40:34.931

Can we, can we go please?

41:09.967 --> 41:12.435
Sure, where do you
want to go to?

41:12.436 --> 41:15.004
Anywhere you want.

41:15.005 --> 41:17.907
Hmm.

41:17.908 --> 41:20.577
Oh my god.

41:20.578 --> 41:22.580
That was for no reason.

41:24.348 --> 41:26.583
Is that your way
of holding hands?

41:26.584 --> 41:29.519
Whoa... what are we doing here?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.354
Hey... whoa, what are you doing?

41:31.355 --> 41:33.022
What are you doing?

41:33.023 --> 41:35.726
Ah... shit.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.500
Oh no...

41:44.502 --> 41:46.536
We could get caught.

41:46.537 --> 41:49.339
I took swimming lessons
here as a kid.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.274
Really?

41:50.275 --> 41:54.444
Me too... until I
almost drowned.

41:54.445 --> 41:56.946
Do you think we knew each other?

41:56.947 --> 41:58.548
You were probably
in love with me.

41:58.549 --> 41:59.909
I was pretty hot
for a 10 year old.

41:59.933 --> 42:01.684
Oh, that's disturbing.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.365
If you want disturbing
I can tell you about

42:03.366 --> 42:05.200
getting my first period
on a water-slide.

42:05.201 --> 42:08.391
No, thank you.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.727
This is crazy.

42:10.728 --> 42:14.731
You know, we're almost
siblings and we grew up,

42:14.732 --> 42:16.733
like, just miles apart
from each other.

42:16.734 --> 42:18.868
It turns out we even went
swimming in the same pool...

42:18.869 --> 42:21.404
what are you doing?

42:21.405 --> 42:22.572
We're at a pool.

42:22.573 --> 42:25.642
Yeah, okay but we're
not going in.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.444
Yeah, Ben.

42:33.584 --> 42:34.918
Come on!

42:34.919 --> 42:37.621
Come in, the water's so nice.

42:41.592 --> 42:44.661
Ben! Ben! Ben!

42:44.662 --> 42:46.964
Okay.

44:09.980 --> 44:15.652
Your ex-wife hurt you bad, huh?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.854
Why'd she do it?

44:17.855 --> 44:19.856
I don't know why, I don't...

44:19.857 --> 44:21.858
really know why.

44:21.859 --> 44:23.493
I don't think she meant to.

44:23.494 --> 44:29.799
I hope not.

44:29.800 --> 44:36.706
But... I can be pretty tough
to be around sometimes.

44:36.707 --> 44:40.176
And there were a few
months in particular,

44:40.177 --> 44:42.779
medication-wise, that
were pretty bad for me

44:42.780 --> 44:48.518
and that's, you know that's
stressful for anyone.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.719
I don't blame her though,

44:49.720 --> 44:52.689
I mean, people like calm waters.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.824
Know what I mean?

44:54.825 --> 44:57.561
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

45:03.901 --> 45:09.639
Things... things
unravelled for me

45:09.640 --> 45:11.709
pretty hard for
me when she left.

45:15.012 --> 45:20.717
I didn't really know
who I was anymore.

45:20.718 --> 45:26.589
And I started to hear voices...

45:26.590 --> 45:29.759
and they were just yelling
at me and screaming at me

45:29.760 --> 45:34.998
for blood and just...
stop and just be quiet.

45:37.935 --> 45:41.037
Sorry, that's like probably
really intense to hear,

45:41.038 --> 45:42.773
I'm hearing voices.

45:50.914 --> 45:58.914
The thing I don't understand is...
how can you love someone,

46:03.794 --> 46:08.931
like really love
someone for so long

46:08.932 --> 46:16.774
and so, like... real...
and then just stop?

46:23.080 --> 46:29.186
Man... when you start talking,
you don't shut up, do you?

46:32.791 --> 46:33.791
Hey!

46:33.792 --> 46:35.224
What are you doing?

46:35.225 --> 46:38.729
Run!

46:39.296 --> 46:42.299
♪

46:47.237 --> 46:49.005
I saw your face, you punk!

46:49.006 --> 46:50.841
♪

46:54.812 --> 46:57.747
I think we lost him.

46:57.748 --> 46:59.649
That was crazy.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.284
Why did we do that?

47:01.285 --> 47:05.822
Because it was fun and
you need more fun.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.991
I need something.

47:40.824 --> 47:43.184
And you don't see anything wrong
with you kissing this girl?

47:43.208 --> 47:46.229
Not really, no.

47:46.230 --> 47:49.031
Even though you only met
because your parents

47:49.032 --> 47:50.233
nearly had you sharing a crib?

47:50.234 --> 47:51.801
So what?

47:51.802 --> 47:55.171
We're not actually related; she's
pretty much just a stranger.

47:55.172 --> 47:57.006
You should be happy
that I'm dating.

47:57.007 --> 47:58.767
At best, you have to
admit that your feelings

47:58.791 --> 48:02.962
about this woman are confused.

48:12.256 --> 48:16.993
I think you're hurting...
deeply.

48:16.994 --> 48:19.829
And at some point the drugs
are going to stop working

48:19.830 --> 48:21.731
and you'll find yourself
confronting something

48:21.732 --> 48:23.232
inside you.

48:23.233 --> 48:24.768
Something I can't even imagine.

48:27.037 --> 48:30.740
So please, just be careful.

48:30.741 --> 48:31.975
Okay?

48:36.914 --> 48:37.947
I'll see you next week?

48:37.948 --> 48:40.751
All right.

48:50.127 --> 48:51.127
She's right, you know.

48:51.128 --> 48:52.628
Stay out of it.

48:52.629 --> 48:55.231
You think you've got it all
figured out, but you don't.

48:55.232 --> 48:56.899
What do you know, huh?

48:56.900 --> 48:58.034
You're just a puppet.

48:58.035 --> 49:00.970
See that's what you
don't get, Benjamin.

49:00.971 --> 49:04.073
We are all puppets.

49:04.074 --> 49:05.042
Hmm?

49:05.043 --> 49:06.176
You suck.

49:21.925 --> 49:24.160
Just one left.

49:24.161 --> 49:28.130
I'm going to let him
live, he earned it.

49:28.131 --> 49:30.399
That's not really
how the game works.

49:30.400 --> 49:33.036
You can take it.

49:36.106 --> 49:43.012
Do you think what
we're doing is wrong?

49:43.013 --> 49:45.181
What do you mean?

49:45.182 --> 49:48.117
Well, I mean like this...
like, us...

49:48.118 --> 49:51.354
the situation that
we're in, you know?

49:51.355 --> 49:52.989
No!

49:52.990 --> 49:57.126
It's not wrong...
we're just connected.

49:57.127 --> 49:59.528
It doesn't matter that
we were almost siblings

49:59.529 --> 50:02.031
or who raised me.

50:02.032 --> 50:03.032
Who did raise you?

50:03.033 --> 50:06.002
Uh, my parents... and
Judy Bloom books.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.003
What were they like?

50:07.004 --> 50:09.438
They were like crack for
people with vaginas.

50:09.439 --> 50:12.308
Not the books, your parents.

50:12.309 --> 50:15.444
I know, I'm... I always
kind of had the feeling

50:15.445 --> 50:18.948
that I was their second choice.

50:18.949 --> 50:20.349
Like, I don't know,

50:20.350 --> 50:22.284
maybe they had buyer's
remorse or something.

50:22.285 --> 50:26.022
Like I remember my mom, she
caught me kissing this boy,

50:26.023 --> 50:28.057
Cody something, behind the
store by our house...

50:28.058 --> 50:31.560
and she slapped me, hard.

50:31.561 --> 50:34.296
And then she says, I wish I
knew who'd given birth to you

50:34.297 --> 50:38.868
so I knew who to
blame for this shit.

50:38.869 --> 50:41.504
And then this look crossed her
face like she meant to think that

50:41.505 --> 50:48.044
and she accidentally said it.

50:48.045 --> 50:52.181
And that's how I found
out I was adopted.

50:52.182 --> 50:53.516
You know how sometimes you think

50:53.517 --> 50:57.253
something's not right
you suspect it?

50:57.254 --> 50:58.814
And all the evidence
has just been there

50:58.838 --> 51:02.324
staring you in the face,
like a word or a thing...

51:02.325 --> 51:06.262
or something was
missing, or hinted at.

51:06.263 --> 51:09.198
Maybe you just thought
it was something else

51:09.199 --> 51:13.170
and then all of a sudden, like...
a phone rings and...

51:18.208 --> 51:20.410
the whole world stops turning.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.157
What's up, girl?

52:43.527 --> 52:46.695
What do you want, Layton?

52:46.696 --> 52:51.200
Well, uh... what's the deal,
are you running away?

52:51.201 --> 52:53.302
None of your business.

52:53.303 --> 52:56.038
Okay.

52:56.039 --> 53:00.109
My dad moved out today so
this is like a cry for help.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.311
Right.

53:02.312 --> 53:04.280
It's kind of desperate,
don't you think?

53:04.281 --> 53:07.283
You should talk.

53:07.284 --> 53:08.384
I just don't like change.

53:08.385 --> 53:09.685
I feel you.

53:09.686 --> 53:13.222
I don't like change
either, change sucks.

53:13.223 --> 53:15.124
Hey, high five for
no change, right?

53:15.125 --> 53:18.160
Keep things simple.

53:18.161 --> 53:21.364
All right, not the time, cool.

53:25.235 --> 53:28.304
That's my mom, I should go.

53:28.305 --> 53:32.675
Oh... okay, well you
forgot your book.

53:32.676 --> 53:36.246
You can keep it, it's
for babies anyway.

53:43.420 --> 53:46.322
The rabbit looked up at
her and it seemed to him

53:46.323 --> 53:50.593
that he had seen her face before
but he couldn't think where.

53:50.594 --> 53:53.262
I am the nursery magic
fairy, she said.

53:53.263 --> 53:55.264
I take care of all
the playthings

53:55.265 --> 53:57.199
that the children have loved.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.734
When they are old and worn out

53:58.735 --> 54:01.070
and the children don't
need them anymore,

54:01.071 --> 54:02.551
then I come and take
them away with me

54:02.575 --> 54:06.242
and turn them into real.

54:06.243 --> 54:11.080
Keep going.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.248
Wasn't I real before?

54:12.249 --> 54:14.383
Asked the little rabbit.

54:14.384 --> 54:16.619
You were real to the
boy, the fairy said.

54:16.620 --> 54:21.358
Because he loved you and now you
should be real to everyone.

54:25.295 --> 54:29.465
My, you look so scared.

54:29.466 --> 54:32.134
You should probably know
that it's been a while

54:32.135 --> 54:36.372
since I've done like anything.

54:36.373 --> 54:44.113
By anything are you talking...
intercourse?

54:44.114 --> 54:46.482
Intercourse... are you sure
you want to say intercourse?

54:46.483 --> 54:48.284
Why, what's wrong
with intercourse?

54:48.285 --> 54:49.485
I don't know.

54:49.486 --> 54:53.056
It's pretty hard to make
intercourse sound sexy.

55:03.833 --> 55:09.638
I want to have
intercourse with you.

Um... well a lot of reasons.

56:32.689 --> 56:36.558
You know, the divorce,
my job was useless,

56:36.559 --> 56:39.428
my meds were trailing...

56:39.429 --> 56:43.232
I didn't have anything
else to do that day.

56:43.233 --> 56:46.568
Awesome reasons.

56:46.569 --> 56:48.537
Well, what do you
want me to say?

56:48.538 --> 56:52.341
I was alone, pretty
much always alone.

56:52.342 --> 56:54.276
Bullshit.

56:54.277 --> 56:58.347
Someone saved you,
someone loved you.

56:58.348 --> 57:00.249
If you were alone,
you'd be dead.

57:00.250 --> 57:06.588
Mmm, I got lucky.

57:06.589 --> 57:09.358
You answered the door.

57:09.359 --> 57:10.959
Why did you do that?

57:10.960 --> 57:13.530
What do you mean?

57:17.267 --> 57:19.635
I mean you slit your wrists,
the hard part's over.

57:19.636 --> 57:21.870
So why answer the door?

57:21.871 --> 57:23.906
You could've just left it.

57:23.907 --> 57:26.575
Literally on the brink of
death and the doorbell rings

57:26.576 --> 57:29.278
right when you need it.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.448
And you call that luck?

57:38.555 --> 57:41.390
A billion trillion particles
working in harmony

57:41.391 --> 57:47.129
across the universe...
think about it.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.165
A teenager steals your car.

57:51.067 --> 57:53.570
Your ex-wife at the post office.

57:56.105 --> 57:58.341
Delivery guy catches a light.

58:00.276 --> 58:02.145
His cell phone is charged.

58:05.081 --> 58:06.683
Traffic is clear.

58:09.619 --> 58:12.255
The paramedics are close.

58:14.190 --> 58:16.559
Tabby is there for you.

58:21.130 --> 58:26.469
Ten thousand obstacles just
vanish from your path.

58:33.443 --> 58:37.279
Like smoke.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.115
And you call that luck.

58:45.622 --> 58:53.395
I, uh, thought... I thought
Claire was at the door.

58:53.396 --> 58:58.133
I thought maybe she
had come back to see

58:58.134 --> 59:04.640
if I wanted to get
back together.

59:04.641 --> 59:06.241
Is that pathetic?

59:06.242 --> 59:12.481
That, uh, that I
would've taken her back.

59:12.482 --> 59:17.186
Yes... it is.

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.343
Yes?

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.510
Can I help you?

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:18.146
Hi, uh, I'm looking
for Hanna Weathers.

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:19.581
I'm Hanna.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:22.217
I'm a friend of Ben's.

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:27.356
Oh, and look, I know you two
have been spending, um...

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:31.393
anyway... I, uh, just wanted to
say take good care of him...

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:35.263
and I don't want you to worry about
me, because we're just friends...

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:37.499
barely friends, I just helped
save his life once is all.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:43.506
Anyway, uh, point is...
he seems happy.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.110
Okay.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:49.678
Hang on, hang on.

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:53.215
Who is Ben?

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:59.489
Sorry, um... I think... I think
someone made a terrible mistake.

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.558
Thanks.

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.495
Okay.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:39.628
Hey Tabby.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.129
Yeah.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.231
Yeah sure, I'll be right there.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.567
All right.

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.409
We need to talk.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.244
Wait, I owe you money.

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.847
Okay, it's not about the
money but I'll take it.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.182
It's about the girl.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.284
Uh... Tabby, did you get
that from my apartment?

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.152
Yeah, why not?

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:04.519
I paid for it.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.480
Tabby, you can't keep
breaking in to where I live.

01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:08.161
Okay wait, would you
just listen for a sec?

01:02:08.185 --> 01:02:08.857
No, no.

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.138
Why are you messing
with my life?

01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:11.859
Listen, your new girlfriend,
whoever she is,

01:02:11.883 --> 01:02:13.829
she is not your sister.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.163
Yeah, I know that.

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.084
I've been trying to tell
you that the whole time.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:17.467
No!

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:21.503
She is not not your sister.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.705
Ben... she is a fake.

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:25.874
I went to the house
on January road...

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.343
and the woman who lives
there, this woman...

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.612
she has never met you.

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.681
Hanna Weathers is a single
mother who has no idea

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:35.317
who the hell you are.

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:38.286
You're being conned.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:42.224
But, Ben... she's not the
person you were looking for.

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.325
Right.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.460
Yeah, okay.

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.821
I'm just trying to figure out
who I had sex with last night.

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:49.799
I don't know.

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:55.872
But... she's not who
you thought she was.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.843
Okay.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:03.845
Ben!

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.413
Hey!

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.415
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.718
How were you supposed to know
she's some kind of criminal?

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:12.687
Well, uh, she stole my
wallet, she shoplifted,

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:14.890
she broke into my apartment
and a swimming pool

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:17.259
so there may have
been some signs.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.560
Well, we can go to the police.

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:19.561
With what?

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.429
We don't know
anything about her.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.764
You could post her photo online.

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.766
Maybe she did this
to someone else.

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:27.903
All I have is that stupid
baby photo, that's it.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:30.405
Actually, uh, that wasn't her.

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.407
Right, god damnit.

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.842
Okay.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:36.578
She's a pro, she's professional.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:37.913
Hey buddy, you want a picture?

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.615
You come back later,
I'll put it up.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:45.620
Uh... excuse... excuse me.

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:46.455
Hi.

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.423
Hey.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:48.424
I knew you'd be back.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:49.425
You want your picture?

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.458
Uh, yeah.

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:51.793
15 bucks.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.929
Sure.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:54.764
Seriously?

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:55.565
Come on, I'll pay you back.

01:03:55.566 --> 01:03:59.367
I promise.

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:00.837
Thank you.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.373
Here you go.

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.374
Thanks.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.076
I'll be right back.

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:07.743
Yeah, sure.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:09.911
Thank you.

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:12.815
Hey, look at this.

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:25.961
- Hey, it's Ben.
Leave a message.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:28.463
You know how sometimes you
think something's not right,

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:29.965
or you suspected it?

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.633
And all the evidence
has been right there

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.568
staring you in the face.

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:37.439
Like a word or a thing...
or something was missing

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.307
or hinted at.

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.943
Maybe you just thought
it was something else

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:44.312
and then all of a sudden,
like a phone rings,

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:47.884
the whole world stops turning.

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.723
Ben... what's going on?

01:04:57.493 --> 01:05:03.365
Uh... I gotta go.

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.933
I gotta go.

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:05.934
Ben?

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:44.406
Looking for something?

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.727
She must've left
something behind.

01:05:45.751 --> 01:05:47.642
Like a trace or something?

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.844
I told you this wasn't
going to make you happy.

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:51.713
Didn't I?

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.581
Wait, what's going on?

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:54.550
You already know.

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.051
No, I don't know.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:59.587
Yes you do... because I know.

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:03.658
And if I know, you know...
and so does she.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.226
What does that mean?

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:08.563
That means that you're talking
to your own reflection, asshole!

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.532
You're hearing shit
and seeing things.

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:13.935
Puppets, deer, jellyfish,
magic fucking coins.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.705
What the hell did you
think was going on?

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.039
Uh, I don't know...

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.843
I mean I guess I thought
it was like whimsical.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:24.546
That is the dumbest
shit I've ever heard.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:28.583
You are losing your mind, man.

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:30.018
None of this is real.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:33.888
Not me, not her... nothing.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.558
But, you know... did...
I thought we...

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.527
You made love?

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.767
Welcome to the suck, my man.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.184
Surprise.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.185
That's not funny.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:46.888
Well, how do you think I feel?

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:47.823
Do you feel?

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:50.259
Everything you do.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:56.731
Okay, uh, Hanna, I...

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:59.868
this isn't going to
work out anymore, okay?

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.903
Are you breaking up with me?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.872
Yeah, yeah... I mean you're a
figment of my imagination.

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.207
So what, what the
hell is anything?

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.049
I mean you don't have to
actually touch things,

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:10.783
you just get signals
sent to your brain.

01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:12.613
It's physics, it's not reality.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:13.915
Well I need reality, okay?

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.716
I need more than this.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:17.785
You want this.

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:18.754
You understand that?

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:20.188
You don't know what I want.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.624
I know how you wanted her
back, I know how you wanted

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.959
to end it all and I know
how you're so filled

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.062
with doubt you can't even
look people in the eye.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.198
I know you, Ben.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:39.741
No you don't.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:43.944
You don't know me.

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:48.783
Because you're just a part of me,
you're not the whole thing...

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:50.618
you're not me.

01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:53.755
I can hide.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:56.791
I can bury myself
so deep inside you,

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:59.961
you're never going
to get me out.

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:02.163
We're always going
to be together

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:07.268
and you'll never know where
I begin and you end.

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:11.739
Hanna... get out of my head.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.742
I'm not even here.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:15.978
Wait, no!

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:04.993
Hanna.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.161
Hanna, wait.

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:08.963
Aren't you tired yet?

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:12.166
What are you doing?

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:14.035
Are you just going
to run away forever,

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:14.970
is that the big plan?

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:15.871
You don't have to chase me.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.238
What are you talking about?

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.374
I'm dying, I'm out there
drowning in a fucking river.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.342
Fine, give up!

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:21.210
No.

01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:22.211
No!

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:27.048
You don't control me.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.049
Okay?

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.920
And I'm done with this.

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:35.923
Why did you make me?

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:43.231
Because I wanted
to be awake again.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:48.236
I was alone.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:50.938
If you let me stay,
I'll be good.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:55.009
I can't keep you in
here forever, okay?

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.778
I can't spend the
rest of my life

01:11:56.779 --> 01:12:00.014
looking for you around
every corner, okay?

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:02.417
No.

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:08.056
That would drive me nuts.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:12.093
Hanna... thank you for
everything, really.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:14.296
I'm not going to forget
you, okay, you helped me.

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:24.238
Well let's just get
this over with.

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:27.942
All right.

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:31.279
So what do we do now?

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.948
Just let go.

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:55.371
Just let go.

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:21.230
Just let go.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:35.203
Ben... what's the matter?

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.038
Put that meat away
when you're done, huh?

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.607
That's good salami.

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.278
Oh, real nice.

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:47.115
What did I do?

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:59.193
You keep that up, you're going
to wreck his heart for good.

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:02.096
What about your heart?

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.431
What do you mean?

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:07.936
I'm fine, I just...
I lost my keys.

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:16.143
What's wrong?

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:17.144
Mom, what's wrong?

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:25.052
They call me at 2:00
in the afternoon

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:31.492
to tell me that my son had
tried to kill himself...

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:35.630
slashed up his arms...

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:39.701
my little boy almost
bled to death.

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:46.208
I'm fine now Mom, okay?

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:54.081
I raised you better than this.

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:59.153
I don't care if you never had
a sister, you lost your wife,

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:01.390
or some woman that
I've never even met.

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.695
Benny, look...

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:12.033
you think you're all
alone in the world?

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:16.270
You let someone see
you at your worst

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:19.074
and you watch if
they stick around.

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:27.583
I... I think I just remembered
where my spare keys are.

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:58.412
You really captured the moment.

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.081
Where have you been?

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.415
I called you.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.317
You leave a picture
with no one else in it

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.753
and then you run off
into the night?

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.254
You can't do that!

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.695
You can't be this
selfish jerk and...

01:17:08.696 --> 01:17:10.176
Just let me talk for
a second, please.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:10.758
No!

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.519
No, all you do is talk
and I listen and I nod

01:17:12.543 --> 01:17:15.880
and I try to make sense of
it and I'm done... okay?

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.600
Okay.

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:21.641
You have to stop treating
people like we don't count

01:17:21.665 --> 01:17:25.373
and stop looking for things
you don't need... because...

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:28.275
because you have friends.

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:34.081
And there are people who...
because...

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.516
What?

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:40.322
When you almost died,
I almost died...

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:45.460
and I hate that.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:56.137
I'm really sorry.

01:17:56.138 --> 01:18:02.210
I'm trying... just... things
are a lot different now.

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:07.782
Can we get better?

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.785
Or can we at least try?

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.655
We'll see.

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:23.798
So who's who?

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:26.233
So...

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:28.302
there you have it.

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:32.473
That's my story... and
now that you've read it,

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:35.810
I hope you understand why I
don't think we should meet.

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:40.514
But I know that you
and I are connected.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.850
I think that we're
all connected...

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:46.754
in ways and through circumstances,
by staggering coincidences

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:50.257
we'll never understand...

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:53.327
because I think
that's what life is.

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:56.030
It's kind of like a
tapestry, woven and dyed

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:58.666
a million different ways...

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:04.371
and we are all these
threads, tangled and alone.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.540
But the lucky ones...

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:10.544
the best of us have
been tied up in knots

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:13.814
from day one, we
just can't see it.

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:15.382
Hello there.

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:17.885
I have a delivery for
a Hanna Weathers.

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:21.188
Mom!

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.190
Are you Hanna Weathers?

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.359
I'm... yes.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.830
Just, uh... yeah,
just right there.

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.767
Okay.

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:37.205
Thanks.

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:38.540
You have a good day.

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:45.246
So, for now... goodbye
and good luck.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:50.452
Sincerely, your almost but not
quite brother, Benjamin Layton.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.256
I was fucking adopted.

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:55.924
I heard that.

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:57.858
Go to your room!

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.928
♪

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:06.567
So... what is a chicken
fried steak anyway?

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:11.438
All I know is it is the official
meal of the state of Oklahoma.

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.407
Sounds like you made that up.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:13.574
Thank you. No, I didn't.

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:16.611
It's a classic dish,
plus it's delicious.
