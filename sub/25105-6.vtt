I saw her in the hospital,

20:34.785 --> 20:36.721

see me again, ever.

20:45.739 --> 20:47.730
- Why?
- She said her life had changed.

20:47.755 --> 20:49.899

with the past.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.902

21:14.458 --> 21:16.861

the lie about the breakup,

21:16.894 --> 21:19.497

is just one big puzzle,
