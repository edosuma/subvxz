00:28.760 --> 00:30.193
Morning.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.720
Hello death hello oblivion.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.990
- What time is it, darling?
- Ten.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.430
- Oh God, I'd better be off.
- It's Sunday.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.598
- It's true, then?
- Happy...

00:44.080 --> 00:46.674
Oh God.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.475
- Happy birthday!
- Oh darling. Oh God, how old am I?

00:50.680 --> 00:52.671
No, don't tell me, darling.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.759
- I'm... I'm...
- You're forty.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.629
Oh God, but I don't feel forty.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.798
- Well, you don't look...
- Oh thank you.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.993
Come on, now. It's not the end of the world.
It's just a day. Like any other day...

01:09.200 --> 01:15.036
It's like I hit an oil patch at thirty-five
and now I'm just skidding towards the grave.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.950
Do I look any different, darling?
Look at my face. Who do you see there?

01:21.160 --> 01:25.597
- You can lie. I just want a response here.
- Get Patsy to do that. She's much better at it

01:25.800 --> 01:28.030
You look like a forty-year old woman
who has just woken up.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.869
I haven't even been asleep
I couldn't sleep.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.709
I could feel the fortiness coming upon me
in the night, darling.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.196
Have a look out of the window.
Are the buzzards circling?

01:39.400 --> 01:42.358
Do you want my present
and those cards now or later?

01:42.560 --> 01:44.357
- They might cheer you up.
- Oh what?

01:44.560 --> 01:47.393
- Oh never mind.
- You have to speak up, darling.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.798
Messages take longer to reach
old brains. I've got old ears now.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.197
Listen to me.
Old ears or not, try and concentrate.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.678
It's your birthday and you can make this
hell for yourself and everybody else,

01:59.880 --> 02:03.634
sulk and feel sorry for yourself,
or get up, cheer up and enjoy the day...

02:04.520 --> 02:07.273
I've made up my mind, sweetie.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.592
If my mother hadn't uncrossed her legs
I could be two weeks younger.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.429
- It feels like the end of my life!
- It isn't the end of your life.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.794
It may only be halfway through your life,
not a prospect I find all that thrilling.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.879
- Find something to look forward to.
- You'd know a lot about it.

02:29.080 --> 02:33.471
How often have you ever been forty?
Never, darling, never!

02:33.680 --> 02:37.514
This is something that is happening to me.
I have to deal with it.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.269
I'm sorry if that sounds selfish,
but it's me, me, me.

02:41.480 --> 02:47.157
It's my bloody 40th bloody birthday.
Oh God, I need some space. Jesus...

02:49.800 --> 02:53.952
I hope you're not organising a party
or anything, are you?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.152
Any sort of special treat
or anything for me?

02:58.520 --> 03:01.990
- A little treat or something gorgeous.
- Not if you don't want it.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.873
- Oh what? What, then?
- It was going to be a surprise.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.551
No, no, darling, I will not have a surprise.
I will not have a surprise party.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.752
If it's going to be a surprise,
I want to know about it,

03:12.960 --> 03:16.509
so I can decide if I want to come
and what I'm going to wear.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.349
You can't expect me to go
to any old bloody party, darling.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.438
Well, I don't want a party.
I don't want a party.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.159
I don't want a special big huge party
with all my friends, darling.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.876
Some celebrities
and little Japanese fingerfood,

03:34.080 --> 03:38.278
and a great band and tequila
slammers all round at midnight.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.792
- Oh well, I'll cancel that then.
- No, I would like that, sweetie. I would.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.276
Well, what then?
What have you organised? What?

03:47.480 --> 03:51.314
Look, I didn't know what you'd want, so I've
invited a few people round for family lunch.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.594
What are you calling family, darling?
We're hardly the bloody Waltons, are we?

03:56.800 --> 04:00.634
- Not just you and my mother, I hope. is it?
- Will you stop behaving like this, please.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.149
Darling, this is how i behave.

04:03.360 --> 04:08.434
I'm allowed to behave however i want
on my birthday. House rule, remember?

04:08.640 --> 04:11.916
Especially to someone who didn't even
think I might like a champagne breakfast.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.999
Not even a bloody cup of tea on my
birthday, that would be asking too much.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.159
Here. Don't bother opening it. Throw it
straight in the bin, where you'll put it anyway.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.239
Oh alright. I want a list of who you've
invited and I'm not saying I'll be there.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.671
Lacroix! Christian Lacroix!

04:34.880 --> 04:37.952
Oh oh, oh...

04:38.160 --> 04:40.310
Oh sweetie, sweetie...

04:41.440 --> 04:46.116
Ooooh, sweetie, darling...

04:49.120 --> 04:51.395
Darling, they're gorgeous.
Where did you get them?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.511
- Was it Harvey Nichols?
- Yes.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.599
- I can get a discount there, sweetie.
- I'm glad you like them.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.918
Hardly the ill-judged tat you normally
give me. I mean Lacroix, darling...

05:02.120 --> 05:05.829
They are Lacroix, aren't they? They're
not just something you put in the box?

05:06.040 --> 05:09.316
- Do you like them or not?
- I like them if they're Lacroix.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.399
- Well, they are.
- Oh good. I like them. Is Patsy here?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.716
- Who got that champagine out?
- I did, for you.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.675
Well, pour me a glass, don't let it
sit there getting warm, sweetie.

05:20.880 --> 05:25.396
And don't pop it, sweetie.
Squeeze, squeeze it out, darling.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.955
Oh sweetie, oh, darling,
can you help me?

05:28.160 --> 05:32.278
I'm having a hot flush.
Darling, quickly, feel my skin. Feel it.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.153
You're standing too close to the kettle.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.350
- I thought I was drying up there for a minute.
- I wish you would.

05:44.560 --> 05:49.839
Do you think we oughtto get some hormone
replacement packs for emergencies?

05:50.040 --> 05:55.831
One day. You could find me a little
toothless old wad of gum on the floor.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.555
You'll have to slap some glands on
me quick. I'll get some.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.111
- Oh God. Who have you invited then?
- So you're coming then?

06:06.320 --> 06:10.279
I didn't say I was coming, I just said who
have you invited. You're forcing me to ask.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.870
Well, there's you, me, Grandma.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.278
- Grandad has to look after the house.
- I thought he was dead.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.152
- There's Justin, Oliver and Marshall.
- Oh God.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.432
Overdosing on the ex-husbands,
aren't we, sweetie?

06:27.640 --> 06:29.995
I didn't know Marshall was over here
from L.A.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.033
- Is my son with him. Is Serge with him.
- No.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.630
- Well, where is he?
- Taking lava from a volcano in Hawaii.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.718
- Did you invite him.
- I couldn't get hold of him.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.798
And, yes, I faxed the volcano.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.671
Honestly, so that's it then, is it?
That's the party list, is it?

06:48.880 --> 06:51.394
You, an old woman,
two bastard ex-husbands.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.672
- One with a poisonous odious boyfriend.
- And Patsy.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.758
- And you.
- I haven't confirmed.

07:00.440 --> 07:04.672
- What are you doing here?
- Making lunch.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.477
Making lunch?

07:10.240 --> 07:13.152
- Cooking?
- Yes.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.239
- Cooking on our cooker, darling?
- Eventually.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.638
Why don't you go upstairs and have a bath
and let me get on with it, please.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.715
- Don't you need some help, or something?
- please, don't offer.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.957
You've only ever used this cooker
to light your fags off of.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.355
Darling, that is simply not...

07:30.560 --> 07:32.551
That is true...

07:32.760 --> 07:35.433
It'll make a change to eat
some normal food.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.473
I like exotic food.
You are what you eat, remember.

07:38.680 --> 07:43.356
Which makes you a large vegetarian tart.
Now, go and have a bath.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.874
Have you got someone to serve?

07:48.080 --> 07:52.039
Oh darling, you have got someone to serve,
haven't you, sweetie?

07:52.240 --> 07:55.277
Oh God, get a couple of Philippinos in.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.678
Don't look at me like that, sweetie.
They do get paid, you know.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.396
They're glad of it.
You can be a socialist and have staff, but no.

08:04.600 --> 08:09.594
No, darling, we'll clear up our own plates
on my birthday, shall we?

08:09.800 --> 08:14.590
Happy to work on my bloody birthday.
Oh yes, this bloody birthday I'm having.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.837
Well, not much of a bloody birthday
so far, is it?

08:18.040 --> 08:21.271
God, you'd think being forty you could
expect a bit more.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.677
An old pair of earrings, some miserable
old family and friends coming round.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.077
And my son, my one pride and joy,
wasn't even bloody invited.

08:28.280 --> 08:33.308
And we'll be forced to eat your cooked food
and clear up our own bloody plates...

08:40.360 --> 08:43.078
Did you just hit me then, darling?

08:45.080 --> 08:47.355
That's illegal, isn't it?

08:51.560 --> 08:54.950
You're not allowed to hit your parents,
are you, darling?

08:55.160 --> 08:56.593
Ow, sweetie! Ow!

08:56.800 --> 09:01.271
Get upstairs and don't come down unless
you can behave. I'm fed up with it, Mum.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.638
- Sorry, darling.
- Not now.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.277
- I don't want to go back upstairs.
- Go!

09:28.600 --> 09:30.795
I like my earrings, darling.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.512
- I'll go and have a bath in them. Shall i?
- Thank you.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.950
What my lovely daughter gave me...

09:42.520 --> 09:46.035
Lovely, lovely earrings...
Ah, they're numb!

10:00.920 --> 10:06.995
40th bloody birthday. Happy 40th bloody
happy bloody 40th birthday.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.116
- How is it going?
- Oh fine. I've sent Mum up for a bath.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.039
- Why don't you pop up and see her?
- Oh no.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.674
- Anything I can do?
- No.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.395
- Anything to cut up or peel?
- No, all under control

10:20.600 --> 10:22.750
- Cook?
- No.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.430
- Would you like me to wash anything up?
- All done.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.154
Nothing I can do to help?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.639
- I need that bowl.
- Oh.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.988
There we are.
Not completely useless, you see.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.317
- Hello.
- Hello, Marshall. Come in.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.273
- Hi, I'm Bo. Sweetie, shall we go in?
- Oh ya.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.631
- You must be Saffron.
- Yes, Saffron. Where's your mother?

10:55.840 --> 10:59.958
- She's upstairs. She may be down later.
- Maybe I should pop up and say hi.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.869
Give her a hello hug, tell her I support her
and I'm open to her feelings,

11:04.080 --> 11:07.277
- Clear the vibes before the others get here.
- No.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.436
Oh I see stairs. Give me your hand.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.314
Don't you want to go to the sitting room?

11:22.520 --> 11:26.274
No, I like the kitchen. It's the hearth,
the warm centre of family life.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.835
- We like it here, don't we, Marshall?
- Yeah.

11:29.800 --> 11:34.112
- How is your mother?
- She's fine. The same. A bit wider.

11:34.320 --> 11:39.713
- Right. And how are you?
- Oh you know. The same.

11:40.840 --> 11:45.038
This is your water, Marshall.
I see four cubes of ice in it. Is that OK?

11:45.240 --> 11:47.993
- Shall i put it here for you?
- Yeah.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.236
Is that a lemon in it?

11:51.400 --> 11:55.393
- Is this a lemon in Marshall's water?
- Not a whole one.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.990
- I think it is, dear.
- Will you take it out for me?

12:00.360 --> 12:02.396
Excuse me. Hi.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.752
Could I get a cloth or a dish
or a napkin to put this in?

12:06.960 --> 12:10.350
- I'll take out a couple of ice-cubes too.
- Ya, that would be nice.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.951
I'm gonna take out a couple of cubes of ice.
This water is really gassy by the way.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.789
Are you sure you can cope
with just pure water, Marshall?

12:19.000 --> 12:23.551
Why don't you have a drink?
Excuse me. It's a party. Go on.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.952
No, Gran.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.674
Go on. Just have a little drink.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.190
That's it. Go on.
One little drink won't kill you.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.437
You used to like a drink.
Just a little one. Go on.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.837
- Just a little teeny sip of a little drink?
- Bo!

12:43.040 --> 12:46.476
Marshall has had a drug
and alcohol addiction problem.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.674
Oh don't feel embarrassed, we talk
about it really freely. He used to shoot up.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.313
Oh dear. You sure?

12:55.400 --> 13:00.235
I see olives. Those are green olives
and those are black olives.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.079
Shall i pip one for you, honey?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.910
- You stay and talk to them.
- Oh no.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.954
- Go back and talk to them. Please.
- I'd rather kiss a baboon's bottom.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.311
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, Dad. Thank you.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.754
- Oliver's here.
- Good. I invited you both.

13:23.960 --> 13:28.397
I want you to know that we think it's
a very, very brave thing that you're doing.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.797
Whatever happens, sweetie,
it's the thought that counts.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.719
- It's the thought that stinks.
- What does an old woman know?

13:34.920 --> 13:39.755
Not that old can't be beautiful
and not knowing something isn't positive...

14:19.240 --> 14:22.312
Something smells yummy.
What time are we aiming for eating?

14:22.520 --> 14:26.513
I was aiming for eating 2 o'clock-ish.
I haven't got an exact schedule.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.632
Marshall may have to eat sooner.
He's hypoglycaemic.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.071
He gets low energy and constipation
if I don't mash it up.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.195
- Have a crisp.
- All right.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.550
There you go.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.149
Happy brthday, Ed. Looking great.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.635
- Did you see?
- Everybody's here.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.638
- Who's here?
- I'm not going down there, darling.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.037
But I want you to go down
and get me a drink. Bring up a bottle.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.277
And talk about me a little
when you're down there, would you?

15:08.480 --> 15:12.189
- Champagne, sweetie?
- Yes, Bolli. They'll be on Moet.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.430
I want you to look round my house again,
Justin.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.792
I'm sure I've got something
that could go on the Antiques Roadshow.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.590
Pay no attention, don't even look at her.
She was always doing that as a child.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.998
- Rescue remedy! Rescue remedy!
- Oh get off, get off, get off.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.789
I didn't realise the party could have dregs
before it had even begun.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.433
Thanks, Pats

16:07.640 --> 16:12.316
Everyone else carry on enjoying yourselves
at my expense. I'm not staying.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.155
- Are you alright?
- Oh you can see me, I do exist.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.876
Too late, darling. Come on, Pats

16:26.720 --> 16:31.714
God, how can there be so much pain
in this leg and not one single mark, Pats?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.992
- Hack with a razor if you want sympathy.
- Yeah I think I should.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.510
Mum, can I come in?

16:38.720 --> 16:41.837
So long as you haven't come
to hit me again, darling.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.716
- Are you OK?
- Ahh...

16:49.040 --> 16:52.669
- Internal injuries mainly, you know.
- Where's Patsy?

16:52.880 --> 16:55.474
- She's on the loo.
- Are you coming down?

16:55.680 --> 16:58.035
What?
- We're not talking to you, Pats

16:58.240 --> 17:01.755
- Are you coming down?
- Oh yes, me. I have to do everything.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.555
I have to get up, I have to get changed
I have to come down the bloody stairs.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.228
It hasn't occurred to anybody
to come up and see me.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.911
I've been up here for hours on my own,
being forty. On my own, darling.

17:13.119 --> 17:18.147
I could be eighty, dribbling in my incontinence
pants before anyone came to see me.

17:18.359 --> 17:23.150
Can I borrow some tights and knickers?
I didn't get home last night.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.477
Second drawer down over there, Pats

17:26.680 --> 17:31.390
- please, we're about to eat.
- That's hardly the high point, is it?

17:31.600 --> 17:35.878
Hardly a tempting smorgasbord
awaiting me downstairs, is there, darling?

17:36.080 --> 17:39.868
- Did you invite Oliver to spite me?
- He's Dad's boyfriend, he should be here.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.116
It's my birthday!

17:42.320 --> 17:46.359
Why do you hate him. What's the real reason?
It's not because he's gay.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.917
I came to terms with that before they did.
All my friends are gay.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.315
Well then, why?

17:54.760 --> 17:57.149
How long is it taking you
to find a pair of knickers?

17:57.360 --> 18:01.239
Have you got any G-strings,
or are they all jumbo?

18:02.600 --> 18:05.910
Darling, there should be a G-string
in there somewhere.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.193
Not that I've worn them since I tried
something on at Harvey Nichols

18:10.400 --> 18:13.153
and thought I was sharing a cubicle
with a sumo wrestler.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.712
- Well?
- Are you waiting for me to say something?

18:18.920 --> 18:21.832
- What have I got to say?
- Why you hate Oliver.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.476
I thought it was perfectly obvious
I hate him because you like him.

18:25.680 --> 18:30.879
I could see you down there, chatting
and laughing and joking with him.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.152
I virtually have to plunge headlong
down a vertical staircase

18:34.360 --> 18:37.432
to even raise an eyebrow from you
those days, don't i, darling?

18:37.640 --> 18:41.952
All right, I promise I won't talk to Oliver
if you come downstairs.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.232
I'll come downstairs
if you'll change those awful trousers.

18:45.440 --> 18:50.230
- Why? You bought me those.
- Those aren't the ones from Benetton.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.035
God, darling, how do you look like this
in clothes?

18:54.240 --> 18:59.633
They look different on anyone else in the world.
how do you do that to clothes?

18:59.840 --> 19:04.709
Just try and relax and enjoy yourself.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.236
- You're not eating, Patsy?
- No, liquid lunch for me, Mrs M.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.398
No wonder you're still thin as a rake.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.797
Men like something to get hold of,
you know.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.355
Isn't that right, Oliver?

19:36.840 --> 19:39.195
You know, you have a terrific figure.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.233
"You have a terrific figure".

19:42.440 --> 19:45.477
Gee whiz, isn't she the cutest thing.
What a sweet thing to say.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.750
- Mum!
- I'm being nice, darling.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.839
Did you find her floating around L.A.
With the rest of the airheads?

19:52.040 --> 19:55.430
- You've been through a few, haven't you?
- Mum, don't! you promised.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.632
We've got to take our minds off
the vegetable bloody mousse.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.354
- How's the script coming, Marshall?
- Yes, how's the script?

20:01.560 --> 20:04.757
Is this the script you've been developing
for the past 15 years?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.712
It's at a really exciting stage.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.071
Marshall just signed a new
development deal with Paramount.

20:10.280 --> 20:14.239
- It's at a very exciting stage.
- Shall i clear the plates, darling?

20:14.440 --> 20:18.433
No, I'll do it, darling, on my brthday.
Shall i work on my brthday?

20:18.640 --> 20:22.189
Oh do not do that in front of me
or i'll throw up.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.757
Heimlich manoeuvre! Heimlich manoeuvre!
Clear, I'm trained in this.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.473
- Darling, I thought I was mad.
- No, you are mad.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.796
- What shall i do now?
- Just sit down.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.233
No, I want to work on my birthday. Isn't there
something I could cut up around here?

20:43.440 --> 20:48.150
- So, you're in antiques as well?
- Yes, Justin and I have a shop.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.874
A shop?
A few miserable old bits of furniture.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.312
And you have to ring a bell. Unwelcoming?
Vincent Price could take lessons.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.751
I've always wanted to know
how they make furniture look so old.

20:58.960 --> 21:04.114
Just let it live with Edina for a couple of years.
That usually does the trick.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.756
You know, I love old things,

21:11.120 --> 21:15.033
I really do. They make me feel
so centred and warm.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.674
It must be so satisfying handling antiques.

21:17.880 --> 21:22.510
- Justin should know, he lived with one.
- Right! Right! That is it!

21:22.720 --> 21:27.953
Oh yes, can't keep your hands off
second-hand goods, can you?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.469
Touché. Cheers, Eddy.

21:30.680 --> 21:35.037
You know, I am sensing
a lot of aggression flowing.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.232
- Are you just going to sit there?
- No, just leave it to me.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.352
- Gee whiz, you are a bad woman.
- I think he is.

21:41.560 --> 21:46.588
I think we should leave. I see no point
in celebrating that she's lived so bloody long.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.997
- Oliver, sit down.
- Coming, Justin? No?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.350
Well if you want me i'll be at the YMCA.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.472
You're not going, Justin?
You're not going? No?

21:55.680 --> 21:57.511
- I'm here for Saffy.
- Oh for Saffy.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.395
- I hope you're happy.
- Yes, warming up. One down.

22:05.760 --> 22:10.709
Forty years, God. It's like my life has
been lived and I don't know how.

22:10.920 --> 22:14.435
I've got this house
and all the things in this house.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.589
I've got a child and two ex-husbands
downstairs. I don't know how I got them.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.951
I don't know if I want them any more,
you know.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.676
I want to be at home
with my record player and my posters.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.758
Not wearing make-up
without frightening people.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.030
I went to a party the other night, Pats

22:33.240 --> 22:36.152
I thought I looked so gorgeous,
so cool, darling.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.750
I just flirted and was loud
and gorgeous all night.

22:39.960 --> 22:44.158
I was Kathleen Turner, Marisa
Berenson, everybody...

22:44.360 --> 22:49.434
I came home and I looked in the mirror
and I was entirely annihilated.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.359
My hair had sort of gone flat
and parted itself in the middle.

22:53.560 --> 22:57.599
A little food here. I don't know
how long the food... All night probably.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.473
No lipstick, eyes like pin holes.

23:01.960 --> 23:07.034
I looked like a 200 year old Red Indian
dead dwarf.

23:07.240 --> 23:12.872
She's not handling this forty thing too well
I wish I could tell her it's no big deal

23:13.080 --> 23:15.071
I had a ball on my 40th brthday.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.840
I felt really strong,
really sorted out about it.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.554
I realised what a wonderful,
lucky person I was.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.799
Whether in your 30's or 40's, you're still
the same gorgeous person. Enjoy life!

23:25.000 --> 23:26.718
When will you be fifty?

23:31.520 --> 23:34.637
She hasn't started fifty therapy yet.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.559
Oh dear...

23:38.880 --> 23:40.871
God, I hate Morgan Fairchild.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.072
I hate Jane bloody Fonda.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.636
I hope their old skin comes back
to haunt them.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.879
I bought that bloody woman's tapes.
I paid for those plastic domes on herchest.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.752
I want them when she dies.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.713
There must be a moment
about a week after death

23:56.920 --> 23:59.957
when all those women finally achieve
the figure they desire.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.277
Skeleton thin with plastic bumps.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.029
The flesh will rot away...
but the bumps will still be there.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.596
- Little coffins full of bones and bumps.
- Yes.

24:13.480 --> 24:18.873
Can I just have a quality moment here?
Can I?

24:19.080 --> 24:21.913
No, really, I just want to stop here
and say...

24:22.120 --> 24:24.554
- Could we hold hands?
- Oh please, no.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.429
Come on, everybody, hold hands,
feeling circle.

24:31.040 --> 24:36.034
I just want to say thank you to whatever
being or entity brought us together.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.595
That's enough Bo,
we know why we're here.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.394
- Duty.
- I'm here for my daughter.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.832
It's got to be more than that.
Both you and Marshall married her.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.838
It was an error on Marshall's part.
He was weak.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.429
He was stoned.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.995
It was the worst trip of my life.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.556
Why you ever married her, Justin,
I'll never know.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.957
- Gran!
- Well, she was, I mean... I had...

25:01.160 --> 25:05.551
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Anyway, she was going through a bad patch.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.830
At least you got away,
without being sucked dry.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.793
I'm paying child support
for a child I'm supporting.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.629
- And I'm paying for this house.
- I'm paying for this house.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.276
- How much?
- Let me handle this, Bo. How much?

25:18.480 --> 25:24.237
- She said she got nothing from you.
- Nothing? Nothing! Marshall pays plenty.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.592
- Bo, I'm handling this. I pay plenty.
- God damn!

25:28.800 --> 25:32.315
- Dad, what is it?
- I've just got to talk to your mother.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.433
This is it. See, honey, it's not over.
How much money could she need?

25:36.640 --> 25:40.599
She's got a tiny little daughter,
who hardly eats anything.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.957
# Happy birthday to you

25:59.640 --> 26:03.758
- Today is bloody No Smoking Day.
- Oh God, bloody No Smoking Day.

26:03.960 --> 26:07.953
- Don't do bloody No Drinking Day, do they?
- No Drinking Day...

26:08.160 --> 26:11.311
No No Shooting People Day.
Can't have that.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.149
No Wearing Bloody Awful Clothes.
Do they?

26:15.360 --> 26:20.559
They don't do Nobody Can Be
A Bloody Boring Old Fart Day, do they?

26:23.480 --> 26:29.157
Saffron wants to know... are you going
to be long in there, burning joss-sticks?

26:29.360 --> 26:31.749
As if i didn't know

26:38.000 --> 26:39.956
Come on, Pats

26:41.680 --> 26:45.389
She's not going to like this.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.591
Here she comes. 1, 2, 3...

26:47.800 --> 26:50.519
# Happy birthday to you

26:50.720 --> 26:52.711
# Happy birthday to you

26:52.920 --> 26:56.356
# Happy birthday, dear Edina

26:56.560 --> 26:58.869
# Happy birthday to you

26:59.080 --> 27:00.798
Oh sweetie.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.231
- Can I just say one little thing?
- Yeah.

27:10.440 --> 27:14.274
"Every life is a trash can among
whose garbage we have to look out

27:14.480 --> 27:16.118
what that person ought to have been. "

27:16.320 --> 27:18.390
- Do you want me to deal with her?
- No.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.349
In with anger, out with love.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.717
- You still here, darling?
- I have to give you your present

27:28.920 --> 27:31.718
Oh presents, yes!
It's my birthday, I get presents!

27:31.920 --> 27:35.549
Already I got this gorgeous pair, pair...
Where's the other one gone?

27:35.760 --> 27:37.751
- Down the toilet, Ed.
- Oh I didn't like them anyway.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.520
From my lovely daughter.
Lovely little thing from Pats

27:40.720 --> 27:44.429
- So, Marsh, where's my pres?
- Sweetheart...

27:44.640 --> 27:47.518
I have the gift. Have many more.

27:54.360 --> 27:57.079
What the buggery bollocks. Is this?

27:58.360 --> 28:01.909
It's a signed copy of my book
on ancient oils.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.439
- Next!
- Aren't you very insulted, Marshall?

28:05.640 --> 28:08.154
I've lived with her.
Believe me, that's flirtation.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.669
- Where's my present?
- It's in the hall.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.953
Oh in the hall. I hope it's not
an old piece of furniture again.

28:15.160 --> 28:19.233
Come on, Pats, let's check it out.
It's in the hall!

28:19.440 --> 28:22.398
We're nearly there.
I think she's had almost a perfect day...

28:22.600 --> 28:25.910
- This money thing is not done with.
- We will sort it out.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.634
- Do you understand me? Just checking.
- Oh yes. Oh yes.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.837
- No, you do it.
- Go on.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.032
# They say our love
won't pay the rent

28:34.240 --> 28:36.356
I'm Cher, Patsy. I'm doing the Cher bit.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.635
# I can't get no

28:47.840 --> 28:50.115
# Satisfaction

28:50.320 --> 28:54.518
# To do what I have done

29:04.640 --> 29:07.598
# Wheels on fire

29:07.800 --> 29:10.792
# Rolling down the road

29:13.560 --> 29:17.838
# Best notify my next of kin

29:18.040 --> 29:21.794
# This wheel shall explode

29:22.000 --> 29:23.274
Words, Pats, words.

29:23.480 --> 29:28.076
I've done an inventory of the house.
I couldn't get into the filing cabinet.

29:28.280 --> 29:31.989
- But I own most of the things in this room.
- That does it, then.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.318
- It's time to bring in the lawyers.
- I will deal with the lawyers tomorrow.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.080
- We have a great man in L.A.
- Listen, leave it to me.

29:39.280 --> 29:42.477
# Wheels on fire

29:42.680 --> 29:46.195
# Rolling down the road

29:48.360 --> 29:52.672
# Best notify my next of kin

29:52.880 --> 29:56.589
# This wheel shall explode

29:59.720 --> 30:02.075
# Mash potato
Watch out, darling.
