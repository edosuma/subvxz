WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:01.835
- Previously on Nashville...

00:01.869 --> 00:04.738
- Your tests showed some
unusual hormone levels.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.640
- I was taking some steroids,
but I stopped.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.509
- The only thing I ever got
From you was my name.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.577
Maitland.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.745
- Brad Maitland, I'm this
troublemaker's father.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.181
I don't know what your
step-dad is doing

00:13.214 --> 00:14.348
keeping you in
school auditoriums.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.616
You deserve a real
stage, girl.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.485
- I hear that's Brad's thing.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.520
Good thing you ain't gonna
have nothing to do with it.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.521
- My wife's missing,
I'm flying to Bolivia

00:20.554 --> 00:22.356
at six in the morning.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.292
With any luck I'll be back
in 48 hours with Juliette.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.260
- I am not coming home.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.129
Here.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.231
- Next time you want to help,
just bring him straight here.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.496
- Mmm, sorry.
- You're late.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.266
- It's the guys at rehearsal,
they're waiting for me.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.268
And they can keep
waiting for me.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.338
- Oh, no go, go.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.439
Go and be great.

01:13.874 --> 01:17.278
- You, um, coming to
The Bluebird tomorrow night?

01:17.311 --> 01:19.580
- Yeah, we'll be there.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.182
- Come on, now.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.285
You!

01:24.318 --> 01:25.453
How am I supposed
to walk out that door

01:25.486 --> 01:27.288
with you looking like this?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.690
- Well, I think you can start
by you getting out of this bed.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.860
And probably walking to
your car and turning the key,

01:32.893 --> 01:34.328
starting the ignition.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.863
- Mmm, okay.
- It's easy.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.531
- I'm going.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.732
- Yeah.

01:39.733 --> 01:40.801
It doesn't look like it.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.570
- Oh, yeah, I'm going.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.374
- So Dell said if we get
this finished,

01:46.407 --> 01:48.409
we can go have breakfast.
- Oh, I can finish up.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.211
- And let her think
I'm slacking off?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.345
No, thank you, sir.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.315
Y'all seem to get
along real well.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.417
- Yeah, she's a great lady.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.252
- Yeah.
I got an uncle like that.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.354
I don't know what
I would do without him.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.922
Hey, you know what?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.758
He's playing a gig at
The Bluebird tomorrow night

02:04.792 --> 02:06.227
if you'd like to join us.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.228
- That's not really my thing.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.399
I thought since you were
playing the other day, maybe,

02:11.432 --> 02:13.601
I don't know...

02:16.270 --> 02:19.240
- Well, I... I heard you.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.874
It didn't seem like something
you were trying to hide.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.610
- Well, it was nothing.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.247
- So you ain't
changed your mind?

02:27.681 --> 02:29.250
- Your music.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.185
- You don't get it.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.286
- I'm trying.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.890
- I'm not going to any gig.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.326
- Okay.

02:41.229 --> 02:44.965
Can I ask what is it about it
that's so hard for you?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.934
- Listen, I got other things
to take care of, all right?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.502
I'll see you later, all right?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.808
- There's my baby girl.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.445
There she is!

02:57.478 --> 03:00.314
Oh, did you miss Daddy?
Did you?

03:00.348 --> 03:01.915
I missed you.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.288
- You must be exhausted.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.789
- It's fine.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.292
- Avery, she'll be back.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.795
- Would you mind just hanging
around for the next few days?

03:14.828 --> 03:17.531
'Cause I don't think I can
handle being alone right now.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.400
- Yeah. Whatever you need.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.801
- Okay.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.670
Did you have so much fun?

03:29.877 --> 03:33.581
- Remind me why you're doing
this down here now?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.849
- I don't know what's wrong.
I can usually do more.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.819
- Well, I'd be lucky to do one.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.689
Ha, the first smile since
the show the other night.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.024
- Oh, I just been thinking,
I guess.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.427
That's a lot of thinking.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.329
- Yeah.

03:48.362 --> 03:51.332
- You know, just to be clear,
our friendship is more important

03:51.365 --> 03:53.267
than whatever
I got going on with her.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.968
All right?
I'm on your side.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.709
Nothing?
I don't know.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.846
- Look, it's not just
about Alannah.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.883
It's about every pretty
face with a nice voice

04:09.917 --> 04:12.720
ready to take my spot.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.954
- What on earth
are you talking about?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.558
- I saw the way the crowd
looked at her.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.959
Made me feel...

04:21.395 --> 04:23.297
- Small.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.600
Just something I never
felt onstage before.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.402
That scared me.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.606
You know who you are and
what you've done?

04:32.640 --> 04:37.378
Listen, it's about
what's in here, all right?

04:37.411 --> 04:38.679
That makes all the difference.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.552
- Did you seriously
just do that?

04:49.490 --> 04:52.993
- * Dear fear
How did we get... *

04:53.026 --> 04:55.663
- A song.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.065
- * How do I let go
- It's gorgeous.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.500
- It's for my EP.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.403
- I wanna make an EP.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.071
- Okay.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.573
Well, pretty sure we said we're
gonna discuss that first, right?

05:05.606 --> 05:06.940
- No, you said you
have plans for me?

05:06.974 --> 05:07.941
So what are they?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.810
- We can talk about that.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.479
But they don't involve you
doing an EP right now, baby.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.348
- Because you're 14 years old.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.984
- Plenty of people release
music at my age, even younger.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.486
- Yeah, I know that.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.020
But truth be told,
most of those people

05:20.053 --> 05:23.591
are releasing candy-coated,
fake Disneyfied pop.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.693
- That's ageism!

05:25.726 --> 05:26.760
- Baby, it's realism.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.429
- Maddie released an EP.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.598
- Yeah. She was older.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.366
- Maybe I'm different
than Maddie.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.801
- Baby, what's
going on with you?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.769
- I just wanna make music.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.771
- Well, good.
You should make music.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.006
Write it, record it,
do all that.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.574
This is the time for you
to figure out

05:40.608 --> 05:41.842
who you are as an artist.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.143
'Cause, believe me,
there are people

05:43.176 --> 05:44.778
that are gonna try
to decide for you, okay?

05:44.812 --> 05:45.846
- Whatever.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.082
- We'll figure it out.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.922
- * Fear

05:56.657 --> 05:59.727
* Fear

05:59.760 --> 06:03.664
* Fear

06:16.009 --> 06:17.711
- What do you mean,
she's still there?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.480
- I mean she's still there.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.416
- I have no idea.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.151
I'm still trying
to process the whole thing.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.886
It's not going very well.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.788
- Man, I'm sorry.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.424
- Hey, look who I found
roaming the parking lot.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.960
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.862
- Okay, you guys
ready for this?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.664
The Last Highways
have been invited

06:36.697 --> 06:38.499
to perform on "The Chew".

06:38.532 --> 06:40.200
- That's amazing!

06:40.233 --> 06:42.503
- I know. Their producer saw
the show at 12th and Porter

06:42.536 --> 06:44.805
and was blown away.
They want two songs.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.175
"Love Street Breakdown"
and "Limitless".

06:48.208 --> 06:49.777
- So they want Alannah
to sing lead?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.581
This is a TV appearance
we're talking about.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.182
- It's great news, Bucky.
Thanks.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.917
- Okay.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.062
- Tell the show I can't
sing lead on both songs.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.900
- Well, because
it's their band, not mine.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.903
- Alannah, the guys
are professionals.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.805
You heard 'em.
They understand.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.973
- I'm not gonna sing
lead on both songs.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.182
- You wouldn't know how to fix
a fax machine, would you?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.651
- Oh, dang, I don't
think I've ever

07:30.684 --> 07:32.052
faxed a thing in my life.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.554
- You have no idea
what you're missing.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.558
I have to be honest.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.026
I'm surprised
you're still here.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.497
- Well, young and pretty
doesn't usually mix well

07:43.531 --> 07:44.865
with manual labor.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.734
- I'm just trying to be helpful.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.902
- I thought I told you, if you
wanted to be helpful to Sean,

07:48.936 --> 07:50.203
you'd come see me first.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.575
- What did you hope to gain
by taking him out?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.043
- Okay, hang on.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.845
First of all, he's not
going anywhere with me.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.146
And second of all, it was
a show my uncle's playing.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.748
Not like a date or
anything like that.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.583
- That's not my point.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.985
Scarlett, you know PTSD is
a constant struggle, right?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.520
- Yes, ma'am.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.521
- And it's different
for everyone.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.856
Sean has agoraphobia.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.057
Just leaving the house
is scary for him.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.659
- Oh...

08:11.692 --> 08:12.826
- A crowded club
would be terrifying.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.127
What you see as
a harmless invite,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.864
I see as anxiety
he doesn't need.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.666
So if you wanna help,
please find another way.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.535
- How's he supposed to get
over his anxiety, though,

08:21.569 --> 08:24.672
if he can't even face
what he's scared of?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.615
- Hey.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.684
- Hey, hey.
Thanks for coming.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.619
- Of course.
Wouldn't miss it.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.020
- Hey, bud, Daphne's over there
if you wanna say hey.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.521
- That's okay.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.625
- Don't take it personally.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.959
He hasn't said two words
to me all night.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.795
- Well, must be something
in the water.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.997
'Cause Daphne's no fan
of mine right now either.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.632
What happened?

08:51.665 --> 08:52.900
- Well, she wants to do an EP.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.134
- Yeah.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.036
- That's so cool!
Thank you.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.938
- Yes!

08:57.971 --> 09:00.908
Plus, it shows
ambition and drive.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.309
I mean, those are all
great qualities, right?

09:02.342 --> 09:03.977
- I guess.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.779
I just don't want her
to get hurt, you know.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.147
There's so much damn
rejection in this business.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.949
I don't want her to have
to go through it.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.818
- Well, doesn't every artist
have to go through it?

09:10.851 --> 09:11.952
- Not my daughter.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.722
I gotta get back to it.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.856
- All right.
Have fun up there.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.957
- All righty.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.730
- Thank you very much.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.031
This next song's
about how

09:24.064 --> 09:25.866
good things do come
to those who wait.

09:31.739 --> 09:35.175
- * Put a thousand miles
on these shoes *

09:38.211 --> 09:41.749
* Was I born to win
or born to lose *

09:44.852 --> 09:47.655
* When the sky
fades to black *

09:49.356 --> 09:51.925
* Pedal down and
don't look back *

09:54.027 --> 09:56.997
* Pedal down and
don't look back *

10:01.434 --> 10:06.139
* Trade in my burdens
for lessons I'm learning *

10:06.173 --> 10:09.910
* As this world just
keeps turning round *

10:11.411 --> 10:16.349
* Wake up the morning and
fight off the shadows *

10:16.383 --> 10:19.853
* That followed me
here until now *

10:21.254 --> 10:24.792
* My time has come

10:24.825 --> 10:28.896
* To turn and face the sun

10:28.929 --> 10:33.667
* Trade in my burdens for
lessons I'm learning *

10:33.701 --> 10:37.104
* As this world just
keeps turning round *

10:38.939 --> 10:43.376
* Wake up the morning
and fight off the shadows *

10:43.410 --> 10:47.047
* That followed me
here until now *

10:48.949 --> 10:50.951
* The night is done

10:52.185 --> 10:54.788
* My time has come

10:56.189 --> 10:59.727
* To turn
and face the sun *

11:09.002 --> 11:10.337
- Woo, woo, woo!

11:10.370 --> 11:11.805
- Thank you.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.310
- All right, Jake.
You want to talk to me?

11:18.812 --> 11:19.980
- No.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.481
- Okay.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.784
Well, you know what?
My house, my rules.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.818
You gotta do it.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.354
- You sound like Dad.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.958
- Oh, honey, don't say that.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.059
- I mean, why did you
two have to get married

11:32.092 --> 11:33.293
in the first place?

11:33.326 --> 11:35.062
I mean, what a disaster!

11:35.095 --> 11:37.464
- Well, I got you out of it.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.834
And that's worth
like 100 disasters.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.838
- He's sending me
to boarding school.

11:48.141 --> 11:53.981
- I heard a phone call between
Dad and Terry, the accountant.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.983
He's making a payment
to Philip Austin Academy.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.451
- Okay, when did you
hear this phone call?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.287
- Last night.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.355
Why didn't you tell me?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.792
- Yes, sweetie.
It would have mattered!

12:06.159 --> 12:08.461
Listen, Jake,
he can't do this, okay?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.130
- Just leave me alone.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.332
- Oh my God.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.009
- He's threatened this before.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.543
- Maybe this is
just another threat, then.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.878
- I don't know.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.181
I know that I have
to say something to him.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.083
But I'm just afraid
that Jake's right,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.819
there's just nothing
that I can do.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.820
- Let me do something.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.287
- No!

12:34.321 --> 12:36.023
- No, Deacon, there
is nothing that you can do.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.357
Trust me.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.159
- You think this is
'cause of us?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.161
- Maybe.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.996
I don't know.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.098
No, you know, the truth is,
it's way worse than that.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.566
It's that I'm daring
to have any happiness

12:46.599 --> 12:48.568
in my life at all, you know.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.938
Just a little bit of it
provokes him to treat Jake

12:50.971 --> 12:53.206
like crap to get back at me.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.843
Don't feel bad.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.177
- It's kinda hard not to.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.246
- I know, and I'm sorry.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.351
I just have to figure out
how to fix this.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.428
- Hey, man, I get not wanting
to talk about things

13:15.462 --> 13:17.898
right now, and I'm
not gonna begin

13:17.931 --> 13:19.499
to tell you how to handle it.
But...

13:19.532 --> 13:22.569
I'm worried about you, okay?

13:22.602 --> 13:25.105
Whatever it is you're feeling,
I'm here for you, okay?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.874
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

13:26.907 --> 13:27.875
- All right, buddy.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.809
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.381
- So what'd you say
to Bucky about the TV gig?

13:35.916 --> 13:37.951
- I don't know what you mean.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.354
- So this is your way of
showing me you're on my side?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.856
- I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.491
- Apparently,
the producers called.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.926
Now they want one song from
Alannah and one song from me.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.594
- Well, that's great.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.262
- I'm not your charity case!

13:49.296 --> 13:51.598
- I didn't say you were.
- Guys, come on.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.301
- It was me.
I told Bucky to do it.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.172
- Thank you very much!

13:59.206 --> 14:01.008
- All right, why are you
mad at her now?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.943
- I'm not mad at anybody!

14:06.980 --> 14:07.981
- I was just--

14:22.662 --> 14:24.197
- I don't know.
Where are you going?

14:24.231 --> 14:25.933
- The library.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.036
- No, I'm all set.
Thank you.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.941
- Bye.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.010
- Coming!

14:39.612 --> 14:42.950
Hey! Come on in.
What are you doing here?

14:42.983 --> 14:47.220
- Hey.
I-- I washed it.

14:49.156 --> 14:52.292
- I mean, well, I used it,
so...

14:52.325 --> 14:53.426
clean bedding.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.129
Military habits die hard.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.165
- Oh, that is so sweet.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.599
Thank you very, very much.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.504
- Hey, so I was thinking.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.639
If you're still going to
your uncle's gig later,

15:06.673 --> 15:09.542
maybe I could come
along if...

15:09.576 --> 15:11.178
if that's okay.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.380
- Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
It was last night.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.015
- Oh, well, next time.
That's fine.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.317
There's another thing
on this evening.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.252
It's a writers room.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.420
It's supposed to be sold out.
But I reckon I can get us in.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.191
- Yeah, but I know the owner.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.993
So it wouldn't be an issue.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.560
- That sounds like a
hassle, you know, so...

15:27.594 --> 15:29.696
- No, it's not at all.
Hey, do you want coffee?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.731
Why don't you sit?
I'll get you one.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.001
- Sure. Yeah, thanks.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.411
- Next, please.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.050
- You're good to go.
- Thank you.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.559
- Not really.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.261
- Here.
Stand up straight, Sarah.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.764
Stop touching my hair!

16:04.797 --> 16:06.199
- Totally.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.135
- I just want to fix it.
Let me fix it.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.074
- So how much does
Will hate me?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.043
- He doesn't hate you.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.546
He's just sensitive right now.
I don't really know why.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.781
- Well, I didn't mean to make
him feel like a charity case.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.216
- I know.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.385
- I just want everyone
to be happy

16:25.418 --> 16:27.054
so we can make great music.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.756
- I get it.
That's very nice.

16:29.789 --> 16:33.326
Thank you.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.695
What about you?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.268
- I couldn't help overhear
a little of what's going on.

16:41.301 --> 16:46.373
- It's just the kind of thing
that happens with Juliette.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.444
- Well, I hope everything
works out for you.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.113
I think she's amazing.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.215
- Thank you.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.121
- Relationships are hard.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.159
- Yeah.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.229
Yeah, some of them...

17:18.305 --> 17:19.672
- I'll see you tomorrow.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.208
- Good.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.550
- Oh, hey, I'm Ilsa.
What's your name?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.452
- Daphne Conrad.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.188
- And what will you be singing
for us today, Daphne?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.656
- An original song
that I wrote.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.458
Wow, okay.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.360
Well, I'll raise my hand
when you're time's up.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.295
So whenever you're ready, okay?

17:42.329 --> 17:43.530
- Okay.

17:53.206 --> 17:58.711
* You held me down,
you took control *

18:00.280 --> 18:05.185
* I did because
I didn't know *

18:07.687 --> 18:10.723
* Jealous, lonely

18:10.757 --> 18:14.394
* Bought all
the lies you told me *

18:14.427 --> 18:18.565
* You held me down,
you took control *

18:19.866 --> 18:22.869
* Dear fear

18:22.902 --> 18:26.373
* How did I get here

18:26.406 --> 18:29.342
* How do I let go

18:29.376 --> 18:32.712
* When you are all
I've ever known... *

18:32.745 --> 18:34.681
- You know who that is,
don't you?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.750
- Who.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.419
- That's Rayna Jaymes's
daughter.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.722
- * I'm scared out of my mind

18:42.755 --> 18:47.394
* But I'll never know
unless I try *

18:47.427 --> 18:49.729
* So this is goodbye
Dear... *

18:49.762 --> 18:51.531
- Okay, okay.
That was amazing.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.233
Thank you.
That's more than enough.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.434
Thanks.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.272
- Thank... Thank you.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.687
Are you seriously trying
to play me, man?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.289
I know you're lying--
- Excuse me! He's on a call!

19:16.323 --> 19:17.690
- I can hear you sweating
through the phone.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.327
I guess I'll call him back.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.861
- Why are you
doing this, Brad?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.596
- It's okay, Leah. Thanks.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.400
Always a pleasure, Jess.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.803
- Can you please just admit that
this has nothing to do with him?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.572
- Of course, it does.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.307
He's not turning in homework.
We had an agreement

19:34.341 --> 19:35.908
and he's not holding
his end up of the bargain.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.977
So now he's gotta be a man
and pay the consequences.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.380
He's 13 years old!

19:40.413 --> 19:41.814
- Well, when do you
want him to do it?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.350
When he's 28 and
still living at home?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.617
- You're not sending
him away, Brad.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.820
- I'm guessing a judge
will say otherwise.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.791
- You have no idea what
is best for our son, Brad!

19:51.824 --> 19:54.661
- Come on.
After he performed...

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
whatever the hell that was
in front of the entire school,

19:56.729 --> 19:58.531
I think the kid needs
some direction.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.800
This is about setting him
on a path that doesn't lead

20:00.833 --> 20:02.669
to a life of aimlessness.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.572
- Well, maybe if he had
a father that loved him,

20:05.605 --> 20:06.673
a father that he...

20:06.706 --> 20:07.974
- Oh, now, no!
Hey, excuse me!

20:08.007 --> 20:09.476
I am doing this out of love!

20:09.509 --> 20:11.278
I know what that kid
is capable of.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.414
Do you know he scored the
highest on his computer final?

20:14.447 --> 20:16.516
I mean, out of
the entire eighth grade.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.817
His teacher called me.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.652
Said if he would
just apply himself,

20:19.686 --> 20:21.921
the possibilities
would be endless.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.624
- So then why are you
sending him away?

20:29.729 --> 20:30.697
- 'Cause you're
holding him back.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.399
- Oh, here we go.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.601
- Woman, you are the Apache
helicopter of parents.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.269
- Okay...

20:36.303 --> 20:37.837
- How is he ever gonna learn
to stand on his own

20:37.870 --> 20:39.606
if you won't let him
fall down once in a while?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.673
That's what I have to do?

20:40.707 --> 20:42.309
- Once in a while!

20:42.342 --> 20:43.310
- That'll keep you
from sending him away?

20:43.343 --> 20:44.744
- Once in a while!

20:44.777 --> 20:46.045
The way you're dealing
with him now is molding

20:46.078 --> 20:47.647
the person that
he's going to become

20:47.680 --> 20:49.316
and I do not understand
why you don't see that!

20:49.349 --> 20:50.317
- Oh, my God! The way
I'm dealing with him?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.784
Because it's crap, Brad!

20:51.818 --> 20:54.287
And everybody knows it, and
you know it, all right?

20:54.321 --> 20:56.923
- Please keep your voice down.
- This is about me.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.291
- Oh, it's always about you.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.392
- And you are not
fooling anyone.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.627
- It's always been about you.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.028
- And I am not letting
you do this.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.630
- I'm afraid it's already done.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.064
- This is not over.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.733
- He starts next semester.

21:14.073 --> 21:18.545
- I so despise you.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.816
- And I think you look
lovely today.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.725
- So they're just gonna
take him out of school?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.527
- I'm afraid so.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.429
- Can she not like sue
or anything?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.064
- Unfortunately, she didn't
come out looking too good

21:38.097 --> 21:39.566
at the end of
the custody battle

21:39.599 --> 21:41.968
and she can't
fight him in court.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.603
- So sad.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.071
- Yeah.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.473
Life is, sometimes.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.978
How about you?
You seen him in school?

21:52.011 --> 21:53.813
Does he seem okay?

21:53.846 --> 21:56.916
- No.
He never really seems okay.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.352
I know his dad's
super hard on him.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.061
- I auditioned for
"Nashville's Next" today.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.571
- I went, I signed up,
and I sang a song.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.544
The show that I told you
that you could not be on?

22:24.577 --> 22:25.845
That one?
- You said I didn't need to.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.714
- Have you been listening
to a single word

22:27.747 --> 22:29.516
that I have been
saying here about...

22:29.549 --> 22:31.618
- Yes, but his parenting has
nothing to do with his show!

22:31.651 --> 22:33.786
- He has everything to do
with that show, Daphne.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.787
His hands are over
every single part of it

22:34.821 --> 22:36.623
and he cannot be trusted!

22:36.656 --> 22:39.058
- Daphne, you can make music
without being on some TV show.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.627
- Some people think
I'm not ready.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.966
- That is not what I said.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.868
For the record, what
I said was that the world

22:48.901 --> 22:50.169
isn't ready for
a 14-year-old--

22:50.202 --> 22:51.938
- You don't know that!
- I do know it!

22:51.971 --> 22:53.806
I know what you got inside you.
I know how special it is.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.676
And I know for a fact they're
gonna try and change that!

22:56.709 --> 22:57.710
- He's got a point, Daph.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.046
- There's no sides here.
- No.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.514
- We're just telling you
what is

23:01.548 --> 23:03.015
and what is gonna happen,
all right?

23:03.049 --> 23:05.818
- We can make music.
Let's make music together.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.488
- Yeah, right.
You have your own career now.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.424
- Where do you think
you're going?

23:11.458 --> 23:12.759
We're not done talk...

23:15.795 --> 23:17.464
- All right, beautiful people.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.098
We got a special treat
for you tonight.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.934
Songwriters who think
they can sing.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.037
- Excuse me.
Sorry.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.106
- Thank you all for
coming out tonight--

23:27.139 --> 23:31.744
- Parking was a real,
a real bitch.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.580
Where you wanna sit?

23:57.970 --> 24:03.643
- * Every time
I let you back in *

24:06.278 --> 24:09.916
* You break my heart
into pieces *

24:09.949 --> 24:13.786
* So I set myself down...

24:13.820 --> 24:15.988
- * Talk myself out

24:16.022 --> 24:17.890
- I'll be fine.
- * Of love

24:17.924 --> 24:21.961
* With you again

24:36.976 --> 24:38.545
- Hey.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.546
- You gotta leave me alone.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.081
- Because I can't be fixed.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.683
- I'm not trying to fix you.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.518
- Sure.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.753
- It's okay to be scared.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.288
- What do you know
about being scared?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.289
You never been scared.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.791
- Oh, that's a joke.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.259
So you had people
shooting at you?

24:53.292 --> 24:55.562
Your friends just blown up
in front of your face?

24:55.595 --> 24:56.796
- No.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.197
I'm so sorry you
went through that.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.799
- I don't care
that you're sorry.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.568
- Sean, will you just
wait a minute, please?

25:01.601 --> 25:02.869
Please listen.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.639
I can't know what it
was like for you then.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.040
But I think I might
have some idea

25:08.074 --> 25:10.677
what it's like
for you in there.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.311
You don't got to get shot
at to feel like

25:12.344 --> 25:14.180
the world's closing in on you.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.948
Like you can't breath.
Like you panic at nothing.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.184
Like you can't even
exist in the world.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.153
- It doesn't matter.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.990
There's nothing that's
gonna make it go away.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.225
- Maybe you just haven't
found the right thing yet.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.829
More drugs, more therapy?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.764
I'm so tired of it.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.966
I'm tired of everybody
looking at me like I'm crazy.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.334
I just...
I want to turn it off.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.636
I want to turn it off
just for one day.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.137
Is that too much to ask?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.873
I wanna be just like everybody
else just for one night.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.242
- No, I want that for you.
I want that for me too.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.178
- Don't compare yourself to me!

25:46.212 --> 25:48.014
- I'm not!
I would never!

25:48.047 --> 25:51.718
Sean, would you just listen
to me for one minute, please?

25:51.751 --> 25:56.689
Look, I see you in
there looking at everybody

25:56.723 --> 25:58.991
like they're all fine.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.894
You don't know what's going on
in those other peoples' lives.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.796
There's a person in there
whose daddy beat

26:03.830 --> 26:06.198
the hell out of him
every night of his life.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.834
There's somebody in
there who got raped,

26:07.867 --> 26:09.335
guarantee you more than one.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.071
Someone in there who
lost a child, lost a parent,

26:12.104 --> 26:14.006
lost the love of their life
to someone who they thought

26:14.040 --> 26:15.775
was their best friend.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.844
It's hard to be
a person, Sean.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.780
Without ever having been
shot at, it's hard.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.786
I'm done preaching.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.761
Let me get you home.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.836
- Hey, Deacon.
Everything okay?

26:43.870 --> 26:46.072
- You tell me.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.941
- She's not coming back.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.214
- You tell me.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.349
That's what she said.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.951
- Avery, I don't understand.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.019
What do you mean,
she's not coming back?

27:00.052 --> 27:01.754
- Well, when I went down there,

27:01.788 --> 27:04.824
it's like I saw a
completely different person.

27:04.857 --> 27:07.159
Truth is, I couldn't tell if
it was for better or worse.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.795
But it certainly
wasn't Juliette.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.397
- Buddy...

27:11.430 --> 27:13.232
- Yeah, she says that
she needs to separate herself

27:13.265 --> 27:15.434
from everyone in her life.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.136
We're all toxic or something.

27:18.705 --> 27:22.108
- No. It's not about her.
It's...

27:24.744 --> 27:28.247
I kept asking myself that
the whole plane ride back.

27:28.280 --> 27:33.152
And then I realized
there's nothing to do.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.721
It's already done.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.257
- I can't be in this
position any more.

27:38.290 --> 27:42.094
First the drinking, then the
rehab and the suicide attempt.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.330
And now this?
When's it gonna end?

27:44.363 --> 27:46.032
I can't spend
the rest of my life

27:46.065 --> 27:48.300
waiting for the next emergency.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.105
- Avery, I'm so sorry.

27:53.139 --> 27:56.876
- You know, I looked in
the mirror last night

27:56.909 --> 27:58.978
and it just hit me.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.448
I don't even care.

28:02.481 --> 28:05.885
I'm done, Deacon.

28:05.918 --> 28:09.021
I'm just done.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.924
And I don't even know
what that means, you know?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.860
We've been together for
so long, but...

28:16.863 --> 28:19.866
I will not live my life
like this any more.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.150
- Hey.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.887
Sorry I went against
your advice again.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.288
I...

28:42.321 --> 28:44.323
I won't try taking him
nowhere no more.

29:16.823 --> 29:20.359
- Okay, so don't say
anything until I finish.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.061
- Okay.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.831
- I promise.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.972
- * People talk
about tomorrow *

29:35.341 --> 29:38.277
* Like they know
which way to go *

29:41.213 --> 29:44.450
* Like the path
that they follow *

29:47.119 --> 29:50.222
* Ain't a winding,
twisting road *

29:53.192 --> 29:57.329
* 'Cause lately it seems

29:57.363 --> 30:00.166
* I don't know where to go

30:00.199 --> 30:03.102
* What's become of me

30:03.135 --> 30:07.106
* Won't you bring
me an angel *

30:07.139 --> 30:09.842
* Call one quick

30:09.876 --> 30:14.881
* Make me a miracle
I could use it *

30:14.914 --> 30:18.250
* Bring me an angel

30:21.053 --> 30:24.190
* Bring me an angel

30:27.626 --> 30:29.595
* I hear words like
don't worry *

30:29.628 --> 30:31.430
- Hey.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.199
- Hey.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.869
* Sleep it off,
close your eyes *

30:40.072 --> 30:43.142
* Lately it seems

30:43.175 --> 30:45.444
* I can't forget

30:45.477 --> 30:49.215
* Sometimes it's
so hard to breathe *

30:49.248 --> 30:53.319
* Won't you
bring me an angel *

30:53.352 --> 30:55.521
* Call one quick

30:55.554 --> 31:01.427
* Make me a miracle
I could use it *

31:01.460 --> 31:04.463
* Bring me an angel

31:07.433 --> 31:10.402
* Bring me an angel

31:14.306 --> 31:16.976
* Mmm

31:21.047 --> 31:22.348
- That was so beautiful.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.184
- Thank you.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.520
- Listen, you're gonna
hate this, but...

31:28.554 --> 31:30.089
there are a whole lot
of people out there

31:30.122 --> 31:31.924
who are gonna wanna hear
what I just heard.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.193
- I'm not sure I can do that.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.894
- Baby, I don't think
you got a choice.

31:38.597 --> 31:42.468
- So there's this guy.

31:42.501 --> 31:47.273
And from the moment I saw him,
I knew I was in trouble.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.475
We started dating.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.378
And I felt like a
teenager again, you know.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.246
All happy and giggly inside.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.616
And he cheated, of course.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.952
And we broke up, of course.

31:59.986 --> 32:03.956
And then I took him back

32:03.990 --> 32:06.192
because I couldn't
stand life without him.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.494
Even though life with
him was terrible.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.697
And the cycle continued.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.733
And each time, I thought
this time I'll do it.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.935
This time, I'll make the break.

32:19.638 --> 32:23.509
And this is not the past.

32:24.776 --> 32:29.081
Even now when
he comes to town,

32:29.115 --> 32:33.986
I drop everything just to
feel like that teenager again.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.988
- You don't have to
tell me all this.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.490
- I keep it a secret...

32:41.393 --> 32:44.263
Because I'm ashamed.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.298
Because I let someone
treat me this way.

32:47.566 --> 32:51.103
I'm guessing...

32:51.137 --> 32:53.139
you know something
about that feeling.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.662
- Hey.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.364
- Hi.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.535
- You know, sometimes as
a parent, you instinctively

33:23.569 --> 33:25.771
react with your heart
and not your head.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.408
And I do that a lot,
and I know that.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.709
And...

33:33.645 --> 33:35.581
I'm sorry.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.516
- It's okay.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.051
- It's when I hear you're
gonna be involved in a project

33:39.085 --> 33:40.519
that has his name on it,

33:40.552 --> 33:42.254
I just can't help
but feel passionate, baby

33:42.288 --> 33:43.655
because I need you
to understand.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.791
So I just get a little...
- I can handle it.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.793
- You're a strong girl.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.096
But once that show
has control over you,

33:50.129 --> 33:51.630
you're not really gonna have
much say in anything.

33:51.663 --> 33:55.401
I'm just afraid that
he's gonna exploit you

33:55.434 --> 33:57.536
because of who you are.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.548
You're just
your mama's little baby.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.151
- Maybe I wanna find out
what else I can be.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.453
Mom did it her way.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.122
Maddie did it her way.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.624
- I know. Why does this show
have to be your way?

34:18.657 --> 34:21.327
- I don't know.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.134
When I went into that audition,

34:28.167 --> 34:30.102
I was so scared.

34:30.136 --> 34:34.373
And then I started singing,
and I felt happy.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.609
Which was
the first time since M...

34:46.252 --> 34:47.353
- Come here.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.734
Okay.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.105
- Yeah, okay.

35:14.913 --> 35:18.450
- Okay, we are going
to try to make this

35:18.484 --> 35:21.420
as quick and painless
for everybody as we can.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.690
But no matter what happens
here now,

35:24.723 --> 35:27.593
remember, always
keep on singing, okay?

35:30.896 --> 35:32.764
Out of the hundreds
of you that came

35:32.798 --> 35:34.333
and sang for us yesterday,

35:34.366 --> 35:36.502
sadly only three
will be asked back.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.905
So when I call your name, please
come join me here up front.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.441
Jackson Morris.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.942
- Oh, my God!

35:49.448 --> 35:51.583
Yeah.
Grace Anders.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.320
- Yes!
- Woo!

35:54.353 --> 35:57.289
- There she is!

35:58.290 --> 35:59.758
- Thank you.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.593
- Congratulations.

36:01.627 --> 36:02.794
And...

36:05.464 --> 36:06.732
Daphne Conrad.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.436
Daphne?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.538
Yeah.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.440
Look at you!

36:14.473 --> 36:16.508
Yeah, believe it!

36:17.843 --> 36:19.911
Congratulations to you.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.214
And to everybody else,
thanks again.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.283
And please come back
next year, okay?

36:27.586 --> 36:30.489
- Five minutes.
- All right. Thank you.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.859
- All right, Jake.
You've got about five minutes.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.494
You ready to go?

36:39.265 --> 36:40.566
- I'm not going.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.768
- Sweetie, we cannot go
through this again.

36:42.801 --> 36:43.935
You have to go.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.003
- Not if he's sending me away.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.505
- I will deal with that.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.706
But right now, you've
gotta get...

36:47.739 --> 36:50.276
ready to go.

36:53.379 --> 36:57.015
- All right, I just wanna
say I am really proud

36:57.048 --> 36:58.550
of everybody in this room.

36:58.584 --> 36:59.751
All right, it's gonna
be a great ride.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.520
Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.521
- All right!
- Yeah.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.555
- Woo!

37:04.990 --> 37:06.392
I can leave.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.493
- No, no, just stay.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.299
- Oh, glory, he's here.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.935
I'll be right back.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.606
We good?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.608
- Yeah.

37:22.641 --> 37:26.412
- Woo!
It's gonna be awesome!

37:26.445 --> 37:27.579
- Damn.

37:32.851 --> 37:33.885
- He doesn't wanna go.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.521
- Let me talk to him.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.855
- He doesn't wanna talk, Brad!
- Jess...

37:36.888 --> 37:38.724
Jake?

37:38.757 --> 37:42.294
Deacon, surprise, surprise.

37:42.328 --> 37:45.864
What? You stop by for a little
skyrockets in flight, huh?

37:45.897 --> 37:47.699
- Wow.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.368
All right, I'm gonna
go get him.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.869
- Yeah, whatever you say.

37:53.339 --> 37:56.742
- Okay, everyone,
we are back on in 15 seconds!

37:56.775 --> 37:58.744
Places, everyone!

38:06.985 --> 38:09.655
- There's my boy.
Come on, man.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.357
A dollar waiting on a dime.

38:12.824 --> 38:16.562
- Just shut up.
- Jake, don't.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.099
- I said shut up.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.369
I don't have to talk to you.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.038
- Brad!
Brad, I will handle this.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.074
Just give me a second, okay?

38:29.107 --> 38:31.443
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.946
- Welcome back to "The Chew"!

38:34.980 --> 38:36.582
They're a hot bad on
the rise here to bring us

38:36.615 --> 38:38.116
some of that Nashville flavor!

38:38.149 --> 38:40.752
- Performing two songs
and making their television

38:40.786 --> 38:42.821
debut live from
"The Chew" stage...

38:42.854 --> 38:45.056
- Which they seem to have
turned into a junkyard!

38:45.090 --> 38:47.359
Please welcome
The Last Highways!

38:47.393 --> 38:48.494
- Woo!

38:54.533 --> 38:57.969
- * I know that I was given
everything I could take *

38:58.003 --> 39:01.707
* From the moment I was living
I was dying to make *

39:01.740 --> 39:04.876
* Nothing out of something,
real out of fake *

39:04.910 --> 39:07.846
* It's hard days living
in the world *

39:07.879 --> 39:10.516
- Come on, Jake!
Don't do this!

39:10.549 --> 39:12.451
- Just go away!

39:12.484 --> 39:15.654
- * And the other in his pocket
a feverish grin *

39:15.687 --> 39:18.957
* Could you spare me a dollar
Whatever you can *

39:18.990 --> 39:21.893
* It's hard days living
in the world *

39:23.194 --> 39:24.830
- Jake!
I'm not gonna ask you again!

39:24.863 --> 39:26.798
- Leave me alone!

39:26.832 --> 39:27.799
- Are you gonna make me
come in there?

39:27.833 --> 39:29.435
- Brad, stop it!

39:29.468 --> 39:30.436
- He only talks like this
when he comes over here

39:30.469 --> 39:31.903
and I'm tired of it!

39:31.937 --> 39:33.439
- Okay, well, threatening
him is not gonna help!

39:33.472 --> 39:35.574
Sweetie, Jake, can I--

39:35.607 --> 39:37.142
- If you're not out here in
10 seconds, I'm coming in!

39:37.175 --> 39:40.479
- * The mother in the market
with her kids in line *

39:40.512 --> 39:43.982
* Getting poorer every second
Trying hard to survive *

39:44.015 --> 39:47.486
* The water isn't running
The bills piled high *

39:47.519 --> 39:49.955
* It's hard days living
in the world... *

39:49.988 --> 39:53.191
- Seven, six, five...

39:53.224 --> 39:58.196
- * Woah
Oh *

39:58.229 --> 40:00.131
* Oh

40:00.165 --> 40:02.668
- Two, one...

40:02.701 --> 40:05.537
- Brad! Don't!

40:05.571 --> 40:08.674
- * I know that I was given
everything I could take *

40:08.707 --> 40:12.010
* From the moment I was living,
I was dying to make *

40:12.043 --> 40:15.681
* Nothing out of something,
real out of fake *

40:15.714 --> 40:18.750
* It's hard days living
in the world *

40:18.784 --> 40:21.453
- You're coming with me now!
- I'm not going!

40:21.487 --> 40:22.888
- Yeah, you said that.
Let's go!

40:30.896 --> 40:33.465
Where are you going?
- Brad, stop it!

40:33.499 --> 40:35.534
- Get up!
- No!

40:35.567 --> 40:37.102
- All right, then
I'm gonna get you up.

40:37.135 --> 40:41.473
- Let go of him, Brad!
Stop it!

40:43.975 --> 40:45.744
- You need to calm down.

41:10.769 --> 41:11.603
- Medic!

41:13.905 --> 41:16.007
- Somebody, come on!
- Somebody call 911!

41:28.987 --> 41:30.622
- We'll be talking.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.600
- Guys, clear the way, please.

41:41.633 --> 41:42.768
- Got a stretcher coming
through, folks.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.135
Will?

41:45.637 --> 41:46.772
- Let's make some room guys.
- Will!

41:46.805 --> 41:48.073
- Make some room.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.074
- Back up so we can
work on him, okay?

41:49.107 --> 41:50.108
- Come on, come on!

41:51.109 --> 41:52.978
- No pulse.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.980
- No pulse...
Please, God...

41:56.648 --> 41:58.283
- Take it easy.
