WEBVTT

03:24.746 --> 03:27.456
When a is less than zero
and b is greater than one

03:27.498 --> 03:30.250
y equals ab to the x power.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.836
This models negative exponential growth...

04:09.082 --> 04:11.708
Maggy.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.628
- Maggy!
- Maggy.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.005
Maggy.

04:20.718 --> 04:25.180
Imagine two transformations
take place at the same point,

04:25.223 --> 04:27.933
a translation and a reflection...

04:29.852 --> 04:33.939
Your daughter's performance has decreased
in the last few weeks.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.858
We're concerned about her lack of focus.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.279
This is the third time
she's fallen asleep in class.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.741
You know, Maggy, you're
selfish and unreliable.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.452
You're just like your father.
All you ever do is complain!

04:47.495 --> 04:49.079
That's the only thing
you ever say, Mom.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.374
You only see the bad in me.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.583
Listen to me.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.794
If your grades don't improve,
and I mean immediately,

04:55.837 --> 04:56.795
you can forget about the band.

04:56.838 --> 04:57.879
Do you hear me?

04:57.922 --> 04:58.964
You can't do that, Mom.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.467
That's the only thing I have,
the only thing I'm good at!

05:02.510 --> 05:05.178
You have a choice to make, Maggy.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.432
And I mean it.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.897
Hi, Maggy.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.399
Hey big fella, how are you?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.151
Good.
Are you sad?

05:19.193 --> 05:22.195
No, no. I'm actually really happy
to see you, Michael.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.782
I got a few new ones.
Wanna play?

05:25.825 --> 05:28.201
Sure, what you got?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.045
Turn it down!

05:53.186 --> 05:57.773
 Bring down the house,
you lost me in shadow 

05:57.815 --> 06:02.194
 We're breathing it now,
run from the day glow... 

06:29.972 --> 06:31.973
Alright, I'm done for today.

06:32.016 --> 06:35.394
Come on, let's play one more song.
We only have a week left.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.770
I don't think we're ready
to do this show.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.523
We have to start playing a real venue
at some point.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.317
Yeah, but let's play
at a couple more parties first.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.568
Might be less embarrassing.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.738
What do you mean by embarrassing?
We're not that bad.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.615
- Come on, Maggy.
- What?

06:48.658 --> 06:51.576
I think we all know why
you are in the band.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.623
I'd better get going, too.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.549
What is his problem?

07:05.591 --> 07:08.927
He's just jealous.
He'll get over it.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.737
Is it true what Pete says?

07:27.780 --> 07:28.905
What?

07:28.948 --> 07:32.492
That I'm only in the band
because of you?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.870
He didn't say that.

07:34.912 --> 07:38.623
He doesn't like me and he doesn't think
that I can sing.

07:38.666 --> 07:42.419
Maggy, just let it go.
You have a great voice.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.256
Our music is just kind of different,
you know?

07:55.516 --> 07:57.142
Why aren't you up yet?

07:57.185 --> 07:59.519
School starts in ten minutes.
Get up.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.274
I can be ready in five minutes.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.403
When will you learn to be
responsible, Maggy?

08:08.446 --> 08:11.364
I forgot to set the alarm.
It's not a crime.

08:13.534 --> 08:17.996
I hate math.
My mom's going to hate me.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.706
That's the second test
I've flunked this year.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.209
If you'd just listen to me,
you wouldn't have this problem.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.628
My mom would kill me
if I got caught cheating.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.712
Why would you get caught?

08:25.755 --> 08:28.673
She wants you to get better grades, right?

08:28.716 --> 08:31.468
Oh hey, this will cheer you up.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.054
Tickets are 20 bucks,
but it's totally worth it.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.179
You have to come.

08:35.222 --> 08:35.764
You can bring Jay if you want.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.392
I know the guitarist, so we can go
backstage and hang out with the band.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.602
I bet they'll have great advice for you.

08:41.645 --> 08:42.645
That'd be so cool.

08:42.647 --> 08:47.150
Fred said they're about to sign with
a major label and go on a national tour.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.194
You should really get to know them.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.530
Yeah, thank you, Kimmy.
You're the best.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.782
What are friends for?
See you tomorrow.

09:46.419 --> 09:51.381
"My dearest Maggy, I hope this letter
finds you in good health.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.135
I've wanted to write you for a long time.

09:55.177 --> 09:59.306
I'm old now, and I wonder what has
happened to you over the years.

09:59.348 --> 10:04.394
I hope you appreciate your life
and the source from which it springs.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.231
Always remember that you
are beautiful and gracious

10:08.274 --> 10:12.360
and that you are here for a unique purpose.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.696
I know life can be difficult.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.949
It is easy to lose sight of the things
that really matter.

10:17.992 --> 10:23.413
But I trust that deep inside,
you know what is precious in your life.

10:23.456 --> 10:29.711
Remember to do at least one thing every day
that gives purpose to your existence...

10:33.966 --> 10:38.053
"Look around for the hidden messages
of beauty and truth.

10:38.095 --> 10:44.476
You can find them in every tree,
every flower, every human being.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.186
We are all connected,

10:46.228 --> 10:52.651
and long for each other's encouragement,
understanding, and love.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.236
"I hope you know
that you are deeply loved.

10:55.279 --> 11:02.452
There are many who look up to you and find in
you an example that inspires and uplifts."

11:02.495 --> 11:05.372
What do you say to that?

11:05.414 --> 11:09.501
I know. Who writes like this?

11:09.543 --> 11:13.797
No, it can't be someone from our school.

11:13.839 --> 11:18.426
It's definitely an old
person's handwriting.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.554
It's signed by someone named Sam.

11:21.597 --> 11:25.308
Oh, my mom just got home.
Gotta go, bye.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.063
"Thank you for being such
a good person.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.692
Ever since you were little,
you were off to great things.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.195
Your parents always knew you had
a special spirit about you.

11:37.238 --> 11:41.533
You have the gift of making other people
feel good about themselves,

11:41.575 --> 11:46.579
of being kind and thoughtful.

11:46.622 --> 11:50.500
May the Lord bless you always,
your friend Sam."

11:50.543 --> 11:54.546
There's no address, but it says here
his last name is Worthington.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.548
Sam Worthington.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.967
Sam Worthington?

11:59.009 --> 12:01.553
I have no idea who that is, Maggy.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.556
But you must know him, Mom, please?

12:04.598 --> 12:08.393
He must be a relative or an old friend?

12:08.436 --> 12:13.982
If anything, I guess this could be
a distant cousin,

12:14.024 --> 12:17.277
or maybe somebody from
your dad's family.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.987
I wish I could help you, honey,

12:19.029 --> 12:22.532
I just, I honestly don't recall
anyone with that name.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.993
I have to go.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.370
See you later.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.230
Maybe it's a prank.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.607
A prank?

12:55.649 --> 12:59.486
But it's totally sweet,
like, from the heart.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.863
Like I'm the greatest person
in the world.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.240
That is weird.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.950
Maybe it's a sweet prank.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.827
Who would even do that?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.621
Hey, you guys made it.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.373
Come with me.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.841
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.386
So, this is Maggy and Jay
from the new band The Threshold

13:25.429 --> 13:26.471
I've been telling you about.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.348
Hi, thanks for coming out
to the show tonight.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.600
Yeah, we're really excited
to see you guys.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.769
We've heard a lot of good things
about you.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.896
Yeah, very excited.
You guys are great.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.649
Thanks. We're excited to play.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.987
- Hey, I've got a question for you.
- Sure.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.448
What would they have to do
to be your opening act

13:45.491 --> 13:47.867
or play in a venue like this?

13:47.910 --> 13:52.080
Uh, well, you could record a demo,
just a few songs.

13:52.122 --> 13:56.626
Play some parties, some small shows,
and just work your way up.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.294
Yeah, they are really good.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.755
- Jay's awesome on the guitar.
- Oh yeah?

14:00.798 --> 14:04.217
You should hear his sound.
Play something, Jay.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.052
- It's okay.
- Come on.

14:06.095 --> 14:10.014
Here, you can use this.
We're not on for another half hour.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.900
What do you play, Maggy?

14:20.943 --> 14:25.530
- Nothing, I'm...
- She has a fantastic voice.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.448
You should hear her.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.787
Sing, Maggy.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.915
No, it's okay.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.993
Mom?

16:06.382 --> 16:07.173
How'd you do?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.300
Well enough.
You could have, too.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.302
I don't know why I'm such a loser.

16:11.345 --> 16:15.264
Hey, remember, "You are an example
that inspires and uplifts."

16:15.307 --> 16:17.892
I still have no idea who wrote that letter.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.938
I might go visit my dad today.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.856
I thought you were done with him.

16:23.899 --> 16:28.486
I am, kind of, but he might know
who this Sam is.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.405
Good luck with that.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.502
Maggy?

16:44.545 --> 16:48.423
Hi. Is my dad home?

16:48.465 --> 16:51.467
Yes, come on in.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.733
You've grown.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.242
How's your mom?

17:16.285 --> 17:20.246
Okay. She worries a lot.

17:22.165 --> 17:26.210
How's school?
Or, are you finished already?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.715
School's okay.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.893
Listen, Dad, I got this letter
in the mail the other day,

17:41.935 --> 17:44.604
and it's from someone named
Sam Worthington.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.939
Do you know who that is?

17:46.982 --> 17:49.442
Sam Worthington?

17:49.485 --> 17:52.528
No, I've never heard of him.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.530
Are you sure?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.453
Looks like an old person's writing.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.455
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.921
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.801
It's all right.

18:14.843 --> 18:19.347
You should come visit more often.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.945
"You might sometimes feel
alone in this world.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.613
You are not.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.783
Someone is watching over you
and blessing your life

18:38.826 --> 18:43.079
even though at times it may not
seem like it.

18:43.122 --> 18:48.167
Your happiness is the reward of
the happiness you endow to others.

18:48.210 --> 18:53.047
I assure you, that if you give of yourself,
you will receive in return

18:53.090 --> 18:57.677
the blessings of a life
full of purpose and joy."

19:09.022 --> 19:11.607
Here. Hope you can come.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.402
Hey, you guys should come.
It's going to be good.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.946
From what I've heard,
you can't even sing.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.365
Yeah, well, what do you know?

19:19.408 --> 19:22.118
You're just jealous you're
obviously not in a band.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.215
Thank you.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.928
Hi.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.975
If this letter was stamped here, it
must have been dropped off here, right?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.435
That's right.

19:47.477 --> 19:51.898
Can I please ask you something?
It's really important.

19:51.940 --> 19:56.027
"I hope you keep up your cheerful spirit,
and I trust that you are well.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.655
For now, I send you a deep feeling
of gratitude and joy."

19:59.698 --> 20:02.658
That's quite the letter.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.203
You sure you don't know
who wrote that letter?

20:05.245 --> 20:08.289
It sounds like someone
who knows you really well.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.541
That's the weird thing.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.130
- Nothing.
- Hey, Bob.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.552
Ah yes, I think I know
who wrote this letter.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.345
Really?

20:22.387 --> 20:23.638
Yeah, I'm not sure who exactly,

20:23.680 --> 20:26.557
but definitely someone
at the Maple Hill Rest Home.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.977
I pick one of these up every day.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.522
Ah, here you go.

20:55.295 --> 21:00.049
Hi, I'm looking for someone by the name
of Sam Worthington.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.680
I don't think we have
anyone by that name.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.349
Can you check?

21:17.901 --> 21:20.152
No, sorry.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.906
But that's impossible.
He has to live here.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.439
Are you Sam Worthington?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.441
Who wants to know?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.570
I think you wrote me a letter.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.406
What makes you think
I wrote you a letter?

22:05.449 --> 22:06.949
Your mailman told me.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.827
Impossible, there are privacy laws.

22:09.870 --> 22:13.789
- You could sue him.
- I might.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.542
So, you wrote this letter?

22:19.755 --> 22:23.549
You are asking me some very personal
questions, young lady.

22:23.592 --> 22:28.054
You wrote me a very personal letter,
Sam Worthington.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.602
So, you pick names from the phone book?

22:34.644 --> 22:38.439
- Maybe.
- But I'm not listed.

22:38.482 --> 22:42.234
- Can't be.
- I'm not.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.622
Nancy is my mother's name,
and that's my address,

22:54.664 --> 22:57.208
but I don't know who this Maggy Fuller is.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.420
You must have accidentally skipped down
a name when you wrote the address.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.507
Well, isn't that something?

23:04.549 --> 23:08.010
Sam Worthington is my pen name.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.514
Your pen name to write letters
to people you don't know?

23:11.556 --> 23:13.432
Yes, that's right.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.434
Look at me, I'm old.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.603
I don't get out much anymore.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.105
I gotta do something.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.816
Yeah, but why letters to people
you don't know?

23:21.858 --> 23:23.818
It's what I'm good at.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.986
Didn't you like your letter?

23:26.029 --> 23:29.573
Yeah, sure, but it drove me crazy
not knowing who wrote it.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.826
Does it make any difference
who wrote it?

23:31.868 --> 23:34.578
I thought the letter was
from an old relative.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.831
You know, someone who knows
my parents.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.707
Well, see, isn't that enough?

23:38.750 --> 23:43.170
Why did you have to go snooping around
and find me?

23:43.213 --> 23:45.172
I don't know.

23:45.215 --> 23:50.469
You're the one person who had
something nice to say about me.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.596
And now it doesn't even
mean anything.

23:52.639 --> 23:55.057
Don't say it doesn't mean anything.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.476
Every word is from the bottom
of my heart.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.978
But you don't even know me.

23:59.020 --> 24:04.024
Young lady, if I'm the one person who has
something nice to say about you,

24:04.067 --> 24:07.361
I know you better than anyone else.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.914
- Michael, you're still up.
- Can't sleep.

24:24.796 --> 24:28.174
- Wanna read me a story?
- Sure.

24:32.095 --> 24:35.639
"November's white flaked snow soon
became beautiful accents

24:35.682 --> 24:38.726
to December's Christmas greens and reds.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.686
Everywhere the iron gate children walked,

24:40.729 --> 24:43.898
they saw the signs that Christmas
would soon come...

25:18.558 --> 25:21.810
I know this recording place that gives
special deals to up and coming bands.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.772
For only 200 bucks, you can record 3 songs.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.649
Which is perfect for a demo.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.401
And we need a good demo,
if we want more gigs.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.904
Yeah, they're usually
booked for months,

25:31.947 --> 25:33.989
but they do have an opening
tomorrow afternoon.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.826
You have to pay in advance,
but you get your CD mixed right away.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.913
That's awesome, Kimmy.
You should totally be our manager.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.456
I know, it's kind of fun.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.584
And we could easily make that back
in one or two shows.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.002
I say we do it.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.004
- Me, too.
- Same here.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.927
All right, I'm in.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.863
I'm leaving.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.076
You didn't tell me you'd
visited your father.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.203
How did you find out?

26:21.246 --> 26:24.873
He called today.

26:24.916 --> 26:29.461
He was wondering if you'd like to go
have lunch with him next week.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.631
- Why?
- I don't know.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.593
Maybe you reminded him
that he's your father.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.181
Mom.

26:41.224 --> 26:44.059
Do you think I could borrow 50 dollars?

26:44.102 --> 26:46.562
What for?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.856
My band is doing a demo.

26:48.898 --> 26:53.027
Maggy, I thought we talked about this.
I don't have a spare 50 dollars.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.904
And I need to see some improvement
at school first.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.740
This is really important to me.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.993
I'll give you the money back.
I can't let my band down.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.953
I promise I'll do better in school.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.955
I'm sorry, Maggy.

27:04.998 --> 27:08.125
First you'll have to prove to me
that you're responsible.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.213
You know, other moms would support
their kids' talents,

27:13.256 --> 27:17.051
but you don't care at all about
what's important to me.

27:17.093 --> 27:22.181
I will support you when you get
your priorities straight.

28:10.313 --> 28:14.358
 Bring down the house,
you lost me in shadow 

28:14.401 --> 28:18.946
 We're breathing it now,
run from the day glow. 

28:18.988 --> 28:23.242
 Turn to react,
cry like a demon 

28:23.284 --> 28:27.663
 Feeling so bad,
it's burning, we're fleeing 

28:27.706 --> 28:32.000
 Deep, deep in ash,
falls like a powder 

28:32.043 --> 28:36.505
 Photos and cash,
it doesn't matter

28:47.851 --> 28:50.602
Oh man, we totally killed it.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.730
He said he's going to play it right away.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.148
All right!

28:54.190 --> 28:55.941
That was the coolest experience ever.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.277
I could seriously do this
for the rest of my life.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.113
Tom said you all did a great job.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.497
It's so cool to finally hear your sound
nicely recorded.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.249
I loved your solo, by the way.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.292
Thanks, man.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.253
With this demo, we can get
our first tour organized.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.422
Feels like we're a real band now.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.132
To the band.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.425
To the band!

29:21.468 --> 29:23.427
Whoo!

29:25.263 --> 29:29.266
Today was the best day of my life.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.351
Thanks to you.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.729
I didn't do anything.

29:33.772 --> 29:39.401
You let me try out for the band.
You believed in me.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.412
I love you, Jay.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.373
I love you too, Pumpkin.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.761
There you are.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.055
I was waiting for you.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.390
You knew I was coming?

30:51.432 --> 30:52.891
Sure did.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.434
Who's the lucky one today?

30:54.477 --> 30:58.564
I don't know, but I have a very
good feeling about this one.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.400
Did you have a good feeling
when you wrote mine?

31:01.442 --> 31:02.568
A very good feeling.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.779
Like a "gift from heaven" kind of feeling.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.574
Thank you for that, by the way.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.284
So you write one every day?

31:10.326 --> 31:14.496
Yep. Gotta do it every day or it's not
gonna happen, you know.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.831
So where are we going?

31:15.874 --> 31:18.125
Ah, you'll see.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.835
Hello, Stanley.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.837
Stanley?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.423
Stanley is my normal name.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.342
You can still call me Sam.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.303
My dear Stella.

31:29.345 --> 31:32.097
I want you to meet my good friend Maggy.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.473
Stella, Maggy.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.850
Maggy, Stella.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.561
You're in for a real treat.

31:37.604 --> 31:42.399
What are we doing?
Sam... Stanley hasn't told me yet.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.361
You go bless other peoples' lives.
It's a lot of fun.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.280
I'll see you tonight, Stanley.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.407
It has been wonderful meeting you.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.409
Great to meet you too, Stella.

31:55.288 --> 31:56.788
One per envelope.

31:56.831 --> 31:57.873
What are these for?

31:57.916 --> 32:01.501
They're personal notes for people
who need them today.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.921
How do you know who needs them today?

32:03.963 --> 32:06.256
You feel it in your heart.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.927
It takes a bit of practice,
but it gets easier each time.

32:09.969 --> 32:13.764
So, you not only write letters,
but also personal notes every day?

32:13.806 --> 32:17.059
Well, I've got to have a reason
to get out a bit.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.977
So, who gets them?

32:19.020 --> 32:21.772
I don't know yet.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.857
Let's look around.

32:31.407 --> 32:33.158
Do you feel something?

32:33.201 --> 32:36.328
Me? Not really.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.706
Yeah, I'm not sure either.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.714
Did you feel something?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.549
Yeah, me too.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.899
What did you tell her?

33:05.942 --> 33:09.528
I said I wrote 1 0 notes of encouragement
this morning

33:09.570 --> 33:13.073
and when I walked by her,
I felt one of them was meant for her.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.200
- And what did she say?
- Thank you.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.576
That's it?

33:16.619 --> 33:20.872
What did you want her to say?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.233
Go for it.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.319
- Me?
- Sure.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.313
That wasn't too bad, was it?

34:27.356 --> 34:31.068
Maybe you should let me read the notes
before I hand them to someone.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.737
Who knows what you
wrote on them.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.743
Thank you!

35:38.427 --> 35:40.220
There's a balance in all things.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.013
If you give, you will receive.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.599
If you give a lot, you'll be rich.

35:44.642 --> 35:48.353
I know what you mean, but I don't
think it's that simple.

35:48.396 --> 35:51.731
Most people are too absorbed
in their lives to recognize it.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.653
Maybe they tried and it didn't work,
so they stopped trying.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.196
But it does work.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.991
If you give of yourself,
you'll be rewarded.

36:01.033 --> 36:03.201
You see, life is like a mirror.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.413
Who you are is reflected
by those around you.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.706
Like my friends.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.499
Yes, like your friends.

36:09.542 --> 36:14.713
For example, if someone steals or is
dishonest for their own advantage,

36:14.755 --> 36:20.051
they'll invite people into their lives
who also steal and are dishonest.

36:20.094 --> 36:24.472
The good thing is you can choose
who and what enters your life.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.517
If you want good and helping
people around you

36:27.560 --> 36:29.519
be good and helping.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.273
It's magical. And it works for me.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.776
I'm not usually good and helping.

36:36.819 --> 36:40.780
You don't know me.
I'm a pretty bad person.

36:40.823 --> 36:43.450
I already told you, I know you better.

36:43.492 --> 36:47.621
You've been good and helping to me,
and I was lucky to get that part of you.

36:47.663 --> 36:50.624
See, it works for me.

36:54.128 --> 36:58.423
- You think I could have one of these?
- Sure.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.342
That means we still have one left.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.969
Better get rid of it quick.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.847
- Here's your check.
- Thank you.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.065
You know, I invented these.

37:15.107 --> 37:17.108
No, you didn't.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.154
Did you really?

37:23.074 --> 37:24.950
Why hello, Stella.

37:24.992 --> 37:29.704
You're back.
Did you have a good time?

37:29.747 --> 37:33.208
You better do it again soon.
It gets addictive.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.043
Maybe next week.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.711
I have a concert on Friday.

37:36.754 --> 37:40.173
A concert?
What instrument do you play?

37:40.216 --> 37:43.551
I don't play an instrument.
I'm only the singer.

37:43.594 --> 37:49.140
Only? The voice is the most beautiful
instrument of all.

37:49.183 --> 37:51.184
Stella used to be
an opera singer.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.895
Why don't we support Maggy
and go to her concert?

37:53.938 --> 37:55.730
I think that's a great idea.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.608
No, I don't think you guys would like it.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.943
It's not that kind of concert.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.070
It's with my band.
We're kind of loud.

38:02.113 --> 38:02.904
Oh.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.365
Yeah, it's just music for...

38:05.408 --> 38:09.744
For young people?
Not for old folks like us?

38:09.787 --> 38:13.290
I think we'd embarrass her if we go.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.292
No, no, that's not...

38:15.334 --> 38:17.585
Why don't you let us decide?

38:17.628 --> 38:20.839
We're not as old as we look, you know.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.069
Good job, Maggy.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.571
I finally see some improvement.

38:44.613 --> 38:46.531
Keep it up.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.742
Thank you.

38:48.784 --> 38:49.868
Not bad, Maggy.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.996
Seems like you finally get the drift.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.790
My mom is going to be happy.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.043
You're welcome.

39:01.255 --> 39:07.802
I feel guilty for neglecting you
all these years.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.929
I am really sorry.

39:13.059 --> 39:16.811
I'm just curious as to why it took you
this long to realize that?

39:16.854 --> 39:20.065
I mean, it's not like I've been living
on another planet.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.484
It's complicated.

39:22.526 --> 39:26.905
I didn't want to confuse you.
And your mother.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.909
I just thought a clean cut would be better
for everyone involved.

39:30.951 --> 39:33.828
Sure, a clean cut.
Better that way.

39:36.165 --> 39:39.626
It makes a huge difference
when you rip someone's heart out.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.586
Maggy, please forgive me.

39:42.838 --> 39:45.298
I did what I thought I had to do
at the time.

39:45.341 --> 39:50.220
And then when I saw you the other day,
I realized how stupid I was.

39:50.262 --> 39:54.808
How I missed all these
important years of your life.

39:54.850 --> 39:57.227
I want to...

39:57.269 --> 39:59.187
What?

39:59.230 --> 40:02.774
Nothing.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.275
I am very proud of you.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.027
You're a beautiful young woman.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.862
You've got a lot of potential.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.365
When I called your mother
the other day,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.283
she kept telling me how wonderful you are.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.911
Mom did?

40:14.954 --> 40:18.498
I doubt that. She never has
anything nice to say about me.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.875
That's not true.
She is very proud of you.

40:24.755 --> 40:28.258
And tomorrow is our first real concert.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.553
It's a long shot, but
it's what I want to do.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.222
I think you should follow
your dreams, Maggy.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.059
Like you did?

40:40.855 --> 40:44.732
I know you can do it.
Just don't ever give up.

41:36.494 --> 41:40.330
"Dear Letter Writer,
thank you for your kind words.

41:40.372 --> 41:42.916
You made me smile and my mommy cry.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.250
The good tears.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.377
Thank you for thinking of me.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.631
Next time, please stay
for milk and apple pie.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.133
Your friend, Michael."

41:57.556 --> 42:01.935
 Sun's coming out,
we'll follow the street 

42:01.977 --> 42:06.439
 We're bowing it out,
we find the street here 

42:06.482 --> 42:10.693
 Overreact,
cry like a demon 

42:10.736 --> 42:15.198
 Feeling so bad,
it's burning, we're fleeing 

42:15.241 --> 42:19.494
 Deep, deep in ash,
falls like a powder 

42:19.537 --> 42:24.374
 Photos and cash,
it doesn't matter

42:32.466 --> 42:40.466
[vocalizing, rock

43:19.388 --> 43:21.806
I totally didn't think
you guys would come.

43:21.849 --> 43:26.561
Stella pushed me into it.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.438
I hope it wasn't too loud.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.064
It was just fine.

43:30.107 --> 43:34.152
I just had to take my hearing aids out.

43:34.194 --> 43:37.030
Sam, would you mind
if I dropped by tomorrow?

43:37.072 --> 43:41.117
- I was planning on it.
- Cool.

43:44.121 --> 43:48.374
Can you teach me how to write letters
like you, Sam?

43:48.417 --> 43:51.085
I don't know.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.004
What do you mean?

43:53.047 --> 43:55.506
It depends on you.

43:55.549 --> 43:59.302
Within every human being,
there's a God-given ability

43:59.345 --> 44:04.682
that if you find it and nurture it, you'll
be able to bless the lives of others.

44:04.725 --> 44:07.143
For me, it's writing letters.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.229
And for me?

44:10.272 --> 44:14.442
- You'll have to find out for yourself.
- How?

44:14.485 --> 44:16.903
You'll feel it in your heart.

44:16.945 --> 44:21.366
When you find it, you'll experience
a force and power within you

44:21.408 --> 44:23.368
that's greater than yourself.

44:23.410 --> 44:25.745
You'll feel connected to the Divine.

44:25.788 --> 44:31.584
There's nothing more empowering than
feeling connected to the Divine.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.338
I don't know how to write like you.

44:35.381 --> 44:39.384
I tried all morning, but it just doesn't
come out the way I want.

44:39.426 --> 44:43.096
You become good by what
you consistently do.

44:43.138 --> 44:46.140
It's only a matter of practice and desire.

44:46.183 --> 44:49.644
I promise you that if you do
something every day,

44:49.687 --> 44:51.896
you'll eventually master it.

44:57.444 --> 45:05.444
 Help of the helpless,
O abide with me.

45:16.088 --> 45:17.171
Hello, Maggy.

45:17.214 --> 45:20.758
I told our group we might have
a real singer with us today.

45:20.801 --> 45:23.010
Would you mind singing for us?

45:23.053 --> 45:25.304
I don't know if I could sing.

45:25.347 --> 45:28.266
I say you do it.

46:13.687 --> 46:20.985
 All is safely gathered in,
ere the winter storms begin... 

46:21.028 --> 46:22.820
Sam's birthday is in two weeks,

46:22.863 --> 46:25.865
and we thought we would surprise him
with a little program.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.200
That sounds great.

46:27.242 --> 46:31.245
And we thought we would all perform
together in a choir.

46:31.288 --> 46:35.208
We voted and decided that you
should be our conductor.

46:35.250 --> 46:39.545
Me? I don't really know
what that means.

46:39.588 --> 46:43.257
It means you make sure we don't
embarrass ourselves.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.136
And that we all sing together in harmony.

46:47.179 --> 46:49.263
I don't know if I could do that.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.598
I know you can.

46:50.641 --> 46:53.434
And don't tell Sam anything about it,
all right?

46:53.477 --> 46:55.269
All right.

46:55.312 --> 46:59.106
It would really mean a lot to him if
you came and visited.

46:59.149 --> 47:01.734
He's been sick for a while.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.946
Who can say no to milk
and apple pie?

47:08.367 --> 47:10.326
I'll let him know.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.997
How did you discover your talent, Sam?

47:15.040 --> 47:17.458
Why do you write letters?

47:17.501 --> 47:20.586
Words.

47:20.629 --> 47:26.217
Many years ago, I had a heated argument
with a friend of mine.

47:26.260 --> 47:29.387
Soon after, she died.

47:29.429 --> 47:34.267
It suddenly hit me that I was using words
to hurt other people.

47:34.309 --> 47:37.019
And I was quite good at it.

47:37.062 --> 47:41.023
At that moment, and it
felt like an eternity,

47:41.066 --> 47:47.321
I became fully aware of all the pain
that I had inflicted.

47:47.364 --> 47:51.284
The worst was that it was
too late to apologize

47:51.326 --> 47:53.327
and make amends to my friend.

47:56.456 --> 48:00.543
So, writing letters is
like therapy for you.

48:00.586 --> 48:03.713
I knew I had to change.

48:03.755 --> 48:08.467
I decided then and there
that for the rest of my life

48:08.510 --> 48:10.803
I would only use words for good,

48:10.846 --> 48:14.891
to lift the broken-hearted
and heal the wounded.

48:14.933 --> 48:19.395
And that has been my desire
and purpose ever since.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.110
Hi, Mom.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.825
You're stealing from me?

48:35.412 --> 48:39.624
Borrowing.
I was planning on giving it back.

48:39.666 --> 48:44.587
I don't remember giving my consent.

48:44.630 --> 48:49.425
My own daughter is stealing from me.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.344
I'm so sorry, Mom.

48:51.386 --> 48:55.514
I wanted to put it back
before you found out.

49:01.438 --> 49:03.397
Mom, honestly, please.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.320
At first I didn't realize it,

49:09.363 --> 49:12.531
but then I noticed that both of you
not only had the same right answers,

49:12.574 --> 49:15.034
but also the same wrong ones.

49:15.077 --> 49:17.703
Which is clear evidence of cheating.

49:17.746 --> 49:21.123
So, who cheated?
Kim?

49:21.166 --> 49:24.418
Maggy? Both of you?

49:24.461 --> 49:29.507
If you don't talk,
I have to suspend you both.

49:29.549 --> 49:32.760
I didn't copy from her.

49:32.803 --> 49:36.931
And I write my own exams.

49:36.974 --> 49:42.228
Kim's grade is consistent
with her other grades,

49:42.270 --> 49:45.439
while Maggy's is not.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.441
Do you admit to cheating, Maggy?

49:52.489 --> 49:56.117
Yes, I cheated.

49:56.159 --> 49:58.202
I'm sorry.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.997
I'll have to give you an F
on the exam.

50:02.457 --> 50:05.459
And you can't sit next
to Kim anymore.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.670
If we ever catch you
cheating again

50:07.713 --> 50:11.424
we will notify your parents and consider
disciplinary measures.

50:13.927 --> 50:15.720
I'm sorry, Maggy.

50:17.556 --> 50:21.475
It's okay. It's a good thing
you didn't get caught.

50:23.812 --> 50:26.689
You should write your
own cheat slips in the future.

50:31.737 --> 50:34.488
Hey, please don't hate me.

51:01.058 --> 51:03.142
Hey, let's go.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.146
What's the matter?

51:09.149 --> 51:11.400
Maggy.

51:11.443 --> 51:16.113
I think it's better for both of us
if we break up.

51:16.156 --> 51:18.491
What?

51:18.533 --> 51:22.161
Why is that better?

51:22.204 --> 51:24.955
I just don't think we
have a future together.

51:24.998 --> 51:27.833
- I'd like to move on.
- Move on?

51:31.046 --> 51:33.339
But what about the band?

51:33.381 --> 51:35.049
The band broke up, too.

51:35.092 --> 51:38.594
Pete just has issues.

51:38.637 --> 51:42.890
We could start a new band,
just you and me.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.642
But why not?

51:44.684 --> 51:48.896
If you don't wanna be with me,
that's fine, but the band?

51:48.939 --> 51:51.732
Please don't take the band
away from me.

51:54.277 --> 51:56.403
Maggy, please.

51:56.446 --> 51:57.780
You know it wouldn't work.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.532
But why?

51:59.574 --> 52:02.368
Because it's over.

52:02.410 --> 52:05.412
It just is.

52:17.843 --> 52:21.887
Maggy. Hey.

52:21.930 --> 52:24.181
What's going on?

52:24.224 --> 52:27.434
We're moving to North Carolina.

52:27.477 --> 52:29.728
What?

52:29.771 --> 52:32.148
I thought Jason told you.

52:37.362 --> 52:39.530
Maggy, wait.

53:04.931 --> 53:06.891
Kimmy, wait!

53:34.211 --> 53:36.295
I'm sorry, Maggy.
I wanted to tell you.

53:36.671 --> 53:38.756
What? That you're gonna
disappear again?

53:38.798 --> 53:41.884
I thought that if we could spend
a little time together

53:41.927 --> 53:44.428
it might be easier for you
to come visit.

53:44.471 --> 53:46.555
When are you leaving?

53:46.598 --> 53:49.308
Tomorrow.

53:49.351 --> 53:50.809
It was good to see you.

53:50.852 --> 53:54.355
Maggy, it's for you.

53:54.397 --> 53:56.982
Please stay in touch?

54:03.198 --> 54:05.157
You're late today.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.160
I know, but I have some really
good news for you.

54:08.203 --> 54:09.119
What is it?

54:09.162 --> 54:13.082
I gave the letter writer your coupon,
and he accepts your invitation.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.417
Really, how did you do that?

54:15.460 --> 54:18.379
I have my ways.
When do you have time?

54:18.421 --> 54:21.840
My mom says I have to go
to the hospital again soon.

54:21.883 --> 54:23.634
Can he come tomorrow?

54:23.677 --> 54:26.720
I'll see what I can do.

54:26.763 --> 54:29.098
Michael, would you mind
showing me your letter?

54:29.140 --> 54:31.433
No, not at all.

54:36.856 --> 54:40.442
"I write to one of the bravest souls
known to man.

54:40.485 --> 54:44.697
Your spirit is unbroken, even though
you had to conquer so much.

54:44.739 --> 54:46.865
You have the strength of a lion.

54:46.908 --> 54:51.829
And despite your pain and suffering,
your smile is as bright as the sun

54:51.871 --> 54:55.040
and the heavens smile upon you
with affection.

54:55.083 --> 54:57.918
The love of God will follow you
wherever you go

54:57.961 --> 55:02.715
and your light will shine forth
throughout all eternity."

55:02.757 --> 55:06.218
Isn't that a nice letter?

55:06.261 --> 55:09.596
Yes. Yes it is, Michael.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.849
So, milk and apple pie tomorrow, right?

55:11.891 --> 55:13.851
I'm planning on it.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.638
Mr. Hansen.

55:51.681 --> 55:54.266
I wanted to apologize.

55:54.309 --> 55:58.771
I made a big mistake and
I really let you down.

55:58.813 --> 56:01.398
How can I make things right?

56:01.441 --> 56:04.193
I know you can do better, Maggy.

56:04.235 --> 56:06.987
Just show me you really mean it,
all right?

56:09.074 --> 56:11.116
I can do that.

56:11.159 --> 56:13.160
Thank you.

56:28.968 --> 56:32.971
Sam. Sam?

56:33.014 --> 56:37.768
Sam! Sam!

56:37.811 --> 56:39.686
You saved my life.

56:39.729 --> 56:43.190
You scared me big time.
Don't ever do that to me again.

56:48.363 --> 56:53.826
I'm sorry, Maggy.
I'm a feeble old man.

56:53.868 --> 56:55.536
The world still needs you.

56:55.578 --> 56:58.038
You have hundreds of more letters to write.

56:58.081 --> 57:01.500
Well, maybe it's just your turn now.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.627
I'm terrible at writing letters.

57:03.670 --> 57:06.213
You'll figure it out.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.508
Be a little more easy on yourself.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.468
I know you have it in you.

57:11.511 --> 57:14.138
You'll find your voice.

57:14.180 --> 57:19.560
All you have to do is let it shine,
let it sing.

57:58.933 --> 58:01.935
What's going on, Kimmy?
Do you think I'm stupid?

58:01.978 --> 58:03.645
What are you talking about?

58:03.688 --> 58:05.230
I saw you with Jay yesterday.

58:05.273 --> 58:06.773
It's not what you think.

58:06.816 --> 58:07.733
Then what is it?

58:07.775 --> 58:10.319
It's nothing.
And why do you even care?

58:10.361 --> 58:14.239
I thought you two broke up.

58:17.827 --> 58:21.747
Looks like your band is doing just fine
without you after all.

58:28.004 --> 58:30.339
Surprise.

58:30.381 --> 58:33.550
Let me introduce my two best friends.

58:33.593 --> 58:36.595
Sam, this is Michael.
Michael, this is Sam.

58:36.638 --> 58:37.804
Hi, Michael.

58:37.847 --> 58:40.015
Michael brought milk and apple pie.

58:40.058 --> 58:43.936
On, great.

58:43.978 --> 58:46.688
Thank you for your letter, Sam.

58:46.731 --> 58:48.899
Thank you for yours, Michael.

58:48.942 --> 58:51.485
And for the invitation, too.

58:51.528 --> 58:55.989
Milk and apple pie.
What a wonderful idea.

58:59.577 --> 59:02.204
I love it.

59:02.247 --> 59:06.333
I'm sorry I took the money.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.126
I know it was wrong.

59:08.169 --> 59:13.006
I'll never do it again.

59:13.049 --> 59:16.093
I want you to be able
to trust me.

59:28.022 --> 59:35.320
I always hoped Dad would be there for me,
but he never was.

59:35.363 --> 59:38.991
Well...

59:39.033 --> 59:43.036
It's not entirely his fault
things didn't work out.

59:43.079 --> 59:46.081
I can be pretty stubborn too,
you know.

59:49.669 --> 59:52.129
I'm not mad at him anymore.

59:55.508 --> 59:59.386
He's got a family now and he has
to take care of them.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.180
I might even go visit them someday.

01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:12.691
But I know now that he isn't
really there for me.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:14.860
Probably never will be.

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:19.948
But you always are, Mom.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:23.285
And I never appreciated anything
you did for me.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:35.714
I just want you to be happy,
make good choices.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:43.180
I love you, baby.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:48.685
 Come, thou fount
of every blessing 

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.217
I'm sorry.
He passed away this morning.

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.597
No, he was feeling better.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.975
He was supposed to be released
at the end of the week.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.478
Are you sure?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.857
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:37.961
No birthday surprise party.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:40.630
He had a good life.

01:02:40.673 --> 01:02:43.300
And he went out on a high note.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:44.801
You think so?

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.136
I know so.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.806
He was very impressed with you
and thought of you as an apprentice.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.641
He wanted you to continue his work.

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:54.060
But I'm not a letter writer.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.937
I can't write like he did.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.525
Don't worry, you'll know what to do.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:05.071
Let's sing our song.
It'll cheer us up.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.991
Sam would have liked that.

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:12.537
I'm sorry, I just... I really don't
feel like singing today.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:32.826
I am the resurrection, amen.

01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:44.940
 Bring down the house,
you lost me in shadow 

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:48.902
 We're breathing it now,
run from the day glow. 

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.531
That's my song.

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.909
They're playing my song.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.203
 Feeling so bad,
it's burning, we're fleeing 

01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:02.540
 Deep, deep in ash,
falls like a powder 

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:07.629
 Photos and cash,
it doesn't matter

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:10.215
Kimmy.

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:13.885
You know... life is like a mirror.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.514
And what you see is eventually
what you're going to get.

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:21.434
And at some point it all reflects
back on you.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:28.775
I saw you at the concert.
It hurt.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:35.115
But I have to admit, you were great.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:38.493
I think the band is really lucky
to have you.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:46.376
I really hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:57.220
I think I understand now what Sam
was trying to teach me.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.806
And what was that?

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:03.685
He didn't want me to be a letter writer.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:07.522
He wanted me to use my own talent
to bless other people's lives

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.733
just like he did with his.

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:13.278
- And I know what that is now.
- You do?

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.198
It's my voice.
That's my talent.

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:21.786
I love to sing, I just never used it
for good or to help others.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:27.584
You knew it all along, didn't you?
And Sam probably did, too.

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:29.586
That's why you asked me
to join the choir.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:36.968
I love the choir,
and I love singing with you.

01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:43.850
I have something for you.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:49.647
Sam wanted you to have this,
as soon as you were ready.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:53.109
You are ready now.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.188
"Dear Maggy, I have been blessed
with your presence in my life.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:35.109
Now that I'm gone, it's time
to pass on to you this key.

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:40.573
It is a symbol of your ability to unlock
any door on your path to happiness.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:46.912
It represents a golden key
of opportunity and potential.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.288
Choose wisely.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:53.086
You probably weren't aware of it, but
this key has been with you all your life.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.880
You just haven't learned to use it yet.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:09:00.218
Whatever you want to accomplish in
your life, you have the key to do so.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.553
It is the same key

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:06.432
that allows you to find happiness
and fulfillment in this life.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:09.727
And with which you
can bless others.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:14.816
Always remember that this key is
yours and yours alone.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:19.194
Whenever you find yourself blaming
others for your circumstances,

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.238
look at the key.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.533
It cannot be taken away from you.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:28.955
You alone decide, which doors to open
and which paths to take.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:33.710
This is the gift of your life and you alone
hold the key to it."

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:39.756
"Lightning splintered across
the putty colored sky

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.968
and the Captain had a foreboding sense
that he should have

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.970
turned the sailboat around sooner."

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:47.515
And why should I let you do that?

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:53.145
Because I know that I can do better.
I can be better.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.399
I just really want to make my mom proud.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.027
All right.

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:02.906
Let me see what I can do.

01:10:02.948 --> 01:10:09.579
 Praise the mount,
I'm fixed upon it 

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.869
"Lightning
splintered across the putty colored sky

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:52.372
and the Captain had a foreboding sense
that he should have

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:54.958
turned the sailboat around sooner.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.711
One of the local fishermen had warned him
earlier that it would be a full moon..."

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:37.667
 Praise the mount,
I'm fixed upon it 

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.802
We brought some milk
and apple pie for you.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:48.970
Thank you.

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:53.224
And here is your personal invitation.
I hope you can make it.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.226
My mom says I'm doing a lot better

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.645
and I'm going to be able
to go home soon.

01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:00.398
That's the greatest news
I've ever heard, Michael.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:03.735
And guess what?
My hair is gonna grow back, too.

01:12:25.215 --> 01:12:27.008
Hey.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.385
You're still up?

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:38.603
Do you think you'll be able
to make it tomorrow?

01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:43.024
I'm going to do my best
to get off work.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:46.027
But you know how they can be.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.493
Thank you, Mom.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:57.705
Thank you for not giving up on me.

01:12:57.748 --> 01:13:00.833
It's all right.

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:04.587
I wish things could be different.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:12.630
I wish we still had a happy home
and I could support you more.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:17.850
And honey, I am so sorry that your dad
and I got divorced

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.269
and you've had to go
through all this.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:26.025
We can still have a happy home.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:36.035
I feel really lucky that you're my mom.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.367
Okay, guys, bam it out on three.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:21.038
One, two, three, bam it out!

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.375
You ready?

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:29.255
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.842
And with this program,
we wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:34.802
Thank you.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:23.518
And now we have a special performance
from one of our students,

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.187
Maggy Fuller.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:16:02.716
I want to dedicate this song to Sam,
who showed me the key to happiness.

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:10.690
And to Michael, whose beautiful spirit
can never be broken.

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:16.070
And to my mom, who works tirelessly
and puts up with me

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:20.741
and never gets anything in return.

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:23.661
I love you, Mom.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:54.358
 The colors 'round the setting sun,
a candle in the dark. 

01:16:54.401 --> 01:17:00.072
 And you're every sailor's
beacon on the shore. 

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:08.205
 There's a culminating
action of a song. 

01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:13.919
 Sometimes there are miracles
and our hands do the job. 

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:20.426
 And for every action,
you move these things along. 

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:25.514
 Everything you do moves
these along. 

01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:31.145
 Angels are hiding
in the motions of humans. 

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:42.323
 We are angels hiding
in the bones of humans. 

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:53.250
 There's a golden key
that opens any lock. 

01:17:53.293 --> 01:17:58.714
 The path to get the thing you want
is never really blocked. 

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:04.512
 And you're every person's
escort to the door. 

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:20.569
 Angels are hiding
in the motions of humans. 

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:31.622
 We are angels hiding
in the bones of humans. 

01:18:58.608 --> 01:19:04.155
 Angels are hiding
in the motions of humans. 

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:15.541
 We are angels hiding
in the bones of humans. 

01:19:58.084 --> 01:20:00.586
Honey, that was...

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.756
That was so beautiful.

01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:10.095
Thank you, Mom.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:14.558
For everything.

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.977
"Dear Sam.

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:00.688
You left us, and we miss you a lot.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.858
But we can still feel
your presence and love.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.611
We have come here today
to celebrate your life.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:10.322
Happy birthday, Sam.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.450
You will always live on
in our hearts.
