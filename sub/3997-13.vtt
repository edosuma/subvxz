WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:05.000
All right, Nick,
we believe in you, man.

00:05.453 --> 00:07.020
Tell us, what's in the cup?

00:07.088 --> 00:08.087
Ah, it's a hard one.

00:09.940 --> 00:10.974
It's a mini carrot.

00:11.826 --> 00:12.960
Onion and potato?

00:13.027 --> 00:14.294
Dumbest boy in all the world.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.896
How are you so bad
at Feely-Cup?

00:15.964 --> 00:17.297
You are awful at this game.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.966
Sea glass?
I'm overthinking it.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.467
If his life depended
on this, he would die.

00:21.534 --> 00:23.635
- Battery.
- When are batteries squishy?

00:23.703 --> 00:25.471
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding--
I know it's not a battery.

00:25.538 --> 00:26.805
I'm kidding. Feel, Nick.

00:27.374 --> 00:29.441
Nick, will you be paying
for bonus time?

00:29.509 --> 00:31.344
He can't;
He is all out of quarters.

00:31.411 --> 00:33.346
Uh, Nick?

00:33.413 --> 00:34.747
Your dad's here.

00:34.814 --> 00:36.215
Very funny, Schmidty,
but my concentration

00:36.283 --> 00:37.782
will not be broken.

00:40.051 --> 00:41.452
Hey-ya, Nickels.

00:43.689 --> 00:45.056
Come on, kid, bring it in.

00:45.124 --> 00:46.824
Come on!

00:46.893 --> 00:48.413
Hello, Mr. Miller.
Welcome to our home.

00:48.427 --> 00:49.794
- Feely-Cup?
- Oh, yeah.

00:49.862 --> 00:50.795
Bring it on.

00:53.265 --> 00:53.765
Watch this.

00:56.501 --> 00:57.134
Tampon...

00:58.996 --> 01:00.704
Wrapped in duct tape...

01:02.073 --> 01:04.108
And dipped...
in baking powder.

01:04.175 --> 01:06.110
- Is that what it is? Oh, it is.
- Boom!

01:06.177 --> 01:09.112
- Next level Feely-Cup.
- Hello, Mr. Miller.

This is a pleasant surprise.

01:19.256 --> 01:21.024
What brings you to Los Angeles, Dad?

01:21.091 --> 01:22.758
Let me just, uh, clean up a little bit.

01:22.826 --> 01:24.894
You know, I just thought I'd stop by.

01:24.961 --> 01:26.561
I'll sleep in your bed,
you can go on the couch.

01:26.629 --> 01:27.829
Sounds like us.

01:27.897 --> 01:29.497
Hey.

01:29.565 --> 01:31.433
So, what does Mr. Miller do?

01:31.500 --> 01:33.335
- Businessman. - A what?
- He's a con man.

01:33.403 --> 01:34.270
He is a con man.

01:34.271 --> 01:35.137
He is a damn business--
What are you talking about?

01:35.204 --> 01:36.371
- He's a con man.
- He's a businessman.

01:36.439 --> 01:37.639
Winston's obsessed with Walt.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.975
That moustache
first of all-- what?!

01:40.043 --> 01:41.809
It's like the world's
sexiest push broom.

01:41.876 --> 01:43.844
A con man like,
"What's the play?"

01:43.912 --> 01:45.579
The, uh, Ring-A-Doo
Johnnycakes?

01:45.647 --> 01:47.348
The, uh, Hollow Leg
Swap-Em-Out?

01:47.416 --> 01:48.749
Yes, exactly.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.452
Fake trombones for a fake band.

01:51.519 --> 01:52.653
Harold Hill!

01:53.470 --> 01:54.555
<i>Music Man?</i>

01:54.622 --> 01:57.090
No, he is not a con man, okay?

01:57.158 --> 01:59.192
You know, he sometimes
used to sell hats.

01:59.260 --> 02:01.261
There you go, boys-- enjoy.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.128
Thanks, Dad.

02:02.196 --> 02:05.529
So many hats.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.633
Okay, technically, they were misprints.

02:10.202 --> 02:11.037
This says:

02:11.105 --> 02:12.905
"Chica Go Bills."

02:12.973 --> 02:16.306
Let's go, guys--
these hats suck.

02:16.376 --> 02:18.978
"Chica Go Bills" is, uh,
actually Spanish

02:19.045 --> 02:21.613
for "Young girl, go Bills."

02:21.681 --> 02:24.583
Who's gonna mess with a guy
who's wearing a hat

02:24.650 --> 02:26.352
that says,
"Young girl, go Bills?"

02:26.419 --> 02:28.354
I mean, the answer is everybody.

02:28.421 --> 02:29.753
They will, they mess with you.

02:31.623 --> 02:34.592
Oh, my... Nick, please
do not angry-fix the sink.

02:34.659 --> 02:36.594
I'm not angry-fixing;
I'm fixing!

02:36.661 --> 02:38.796
You want to know why I'm messed up?

02:38.864 --> 02:40.531
Why I don't trust people?

02:40.599 --> 02:41.799
Why I have anger issues?

02:41.867 --> 02:43.468
Oh, yes, I do want to know.

02:43.535 --> 02:45.435
Why I have the blood pressure
of a hummingbird?

02:48.606 --> 02:50.940
Do you think this
is maybe about your dad?

02:53.511 --> 02:54.611
<i>And so Nickels comes</i>

02:54.678 --> 02:56.713
into my room screaming,
"Daddy, Daddy."

02:56.780 --> 02:58.348
So I go,
"What's wrong?"

02:58.416 --> 03:01.150
He says, "Daddy, I have a tick
at the end of my tinkle."

03:01.218 --> 03:02.918
Oh, my God!

03:02.986 --> 03:05.388
- This is not a story for everyone.
- And sure enough,

03:05.455 --> 03:07.289
there is a tick

03:07.357 --> 03:09.058
at the end of his little penis.

03:09.126 --> 03:10.526
Not a story for this moment.

03:10.593 --> 03:12.061
That's how he got the
nickname "Little Penis."

03:12.129 --> 03:14.096
Oh, stop calling me that.

03:14.164 --> 03:16.484
- What are we gonna do with this guy?
- I have no idea, Pop-Pop.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.533
- Don't call him Pop-Pop.
- That's his nickname.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.435
- The nickname is longer than Walt.
- But that's the nickname

03:20.503 --> 03:21.603
that I gave him.

03:21.604 --> 03:22.703
Yeah, but it's really weird
that you call my dad Pop-Pop.

03:22.771 --> 03:24.572
- I like Pop-Pop.
- You don't get it. You don't get it.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.107
Yeah, fine, just don't
call him Pop-Pop, so...

03:26.175 --> 03:27.975
I think it's time for another drink.

03:28.044 --> 03:29.144
What do you say, gorgeous?

03:29.211 --> 03:30.412
You want to give an old man a hand?

03:30.479 --> 03:31.513
Sure.

03:33.081 --> 03:34.281
I don't know, Nick.

03:34.349 --> 03:35.615
A lot of charm coming

03:35.683 --> 03:36.723
from this end of the booth.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.018
'Cause that's what he does.

03:38.086 --> 03:39.719
He lures you in

03:39.787 --> 03:42.356
with his charm and his moustache
and his perfect hair.

03:42.424 --> 03:44.758
I feel like you need
to talk to him about this.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.026
Right, 'cause I'll just
tell him how I feel,

03:46.094 --> 03:47.627
and everything will be okay

03:47.695 --> 03:49.228
'cause that's really
the way the world works.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.830
Took the words right out
of my mouth, Little Penis.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.533
- It's not a thing.
- I love a good nickname.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.767
Not... not gonna stick.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.001
You know, when Nick
is not working here,

03:56.070 --> 03:57.570
the service is abysmal.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.172
I mean, how many times
did I have to repeat

03:59.239 --> 04:00.706
the words, "Lemon Drop shot"?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.294
Yeah, I think he was making fun of you.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.509
For what?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.910
Working hard and playing hard?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.344
I guess the joke is on me.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.580
Another Indian guy?

04:08.647 --> 04:10.148
- My mom set me up.
- Oh, your mom.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.149
- That's cool.
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.917
Have fun with your, your Devs...

04:12.985 --> 04:15.753
and your...
and your An-Anujs...

04:15.821 --> 04:17.956
or your Deepaks.

04:18.023 --> 04:19.791
Whatever Patel you're dating.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.257
I'm-I'm not sweating it.

04:21.326 --> 04:22.626
His name's Pavun, Pavun Shetty.

04:22.694 --> 04:24.095
What?

04:24.162 --> 04:27.465
- As in, as in "Shetty Solutions"?
- I think so. Why?

04:27.532 --> 04:29.366
They only nailed the
crowd-control logistics

04:29.434 --> 04:31.102
of Bombay's revamped
open-air market.

04:31.169 --> 04:32.136
I thought you weren't sweating it.

04:32.204 --> 04:35.473
I'm not sweating it.
Sweating it.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.707
Killing me with that Drop, dude.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.344
You really seem to care
about Little Nicky.

04:41.412 --> 04:43.079
I mean, look at him.

04:43.147 --> 04:46.480
He looks like Hilary Swank mixed
with a sad, wet dog.

04:47.184 --> 04:48.884
Do you think he's really angry at me?

04:48.952 --> 04:50.386
I think you need to talk to him.

04:51.454 --> 04:53.422
All I'm looking for is a second chance.

04:55.758 --> 04:57.259
You don't happen to believe
in second chances,

04:57.327 --> 04:58.293
do you, Blue Eyes?

04:58.361 --> 05:00.229
Actually, I, um...

05:00.296 --> 05:02.864
I'm a bit of a sucker
for second chances.

05:02.932 --> 05:05.367
They're my first
favorite kind of chance.

05:05.935 --> 05:08.170
Have you ever been to the racetrack?

05:10.591 --> 05:12.724
Back at the tracks with my dad.

05:12.793 --> 05:14.026
When Nick was a kid, he would come

05:14.094 --> 05:15.427
to the track with me all the time.

05:15.495 --> 05:16.628
And if I got in trouble,

05:16.696 --> 05:17.596
he would get me out of it

05:17.664 --> 05:18.864
by doing the Sugar Ray.

05:18.932 --> 05:20.966
- Oh, the Sugar Ray.
- What's a Sugar Ray?

05:21.034 --> 05:23.102
It's when I pretend
to be a diabetic kid

05:23.170 --> 05:24.403
so the man who is threatening

05:24.470 --> 05:26.437
to beat up my father
would run off scared.

05:26.505 --> 05:29.274
You see, we did have
some good times, didn't we?

05:29.341 --> 05:30.341
Now, come on, let's make a bet.

05:30.909 --> 05:31.976
Here you go.

05:32.744 --> 05:33.845
What's the catch?

05:33.913 --> 05:35.546
What catch?
There is no catch.

05:35.614 --> 05:36.747
What possible catch can there be?

05:36.815 --> 05:38.649
All I want you to do is make a bet.

05:39.217 --> 05:40.651
All right, Pop, you want me
to lose your money?

05:40.719 --> 05:42.920
I'll be happy to.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.074

05:53.597 --> 05:55.097
Schmidt.

05:55.865 --> 05:57.534
Robby?

05:58.101 --> 05:59.436
Robby, what are, what are
you doing here, man?

05:59.503 --> 06:01.705
- I'm spying on Cece.
- Cece.

06:01.772 --> 06:03.506
You know, I'm still
in love with her, so...

06:03.574 --> 06:06.042
this is pretty much your basic
broken-hearted spying thing.

06:06.609 --> 06:07.710
It's why I got this hat.

06:07.777 --> 06:09.537
Aw, come on, Robby,
you got to get over that.

06:09.579 --> 06:11.046
Wait a second, are you
spying on Cece, too?

06:11.113 --> 06:12.914
No. What?

06:12.982 --> 06:15.317
- Are you still in love with Cece?
- No, that's still...

06:15.385 --> 06:17.052
Yes, I am.

06:17.519 --> 06:18.387
It's killing me.

06:18.455 --> 06:19.955
Me, too!
Bring it in, man.

06:25.594 --> 06:26.894
What are you two doing here?

06:26.962 --> 06:28.730
- Whoa, hey.
- Cece?

06:28.797 --> 06:30.477
- Just nothing, we're just...
- Yeah, you know.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.768
Do you think that she saw me?

06:33.836 --> 06:36.571
What? Of course
she saw you.

06:36.638 --> 06:37.972
Do you think she saw me?

06:38.039 --> 06:39.740
Well, yeah, you don't have a hat on.

06:40.007 --> 06:42.876
Nicky only had one dream
when he was a kid--

06:42.944 --> 06:45.545
to own a family horse.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.946
That is so surprising 'cause
it just doesn't seem like...

06:49.650 --> 06:51.150
Nick hates living things,

06:51.218 --> 06:53.019
so, like, it just doesn't really seem

06:53.087 --> 06:54.753
like in line with
what I know about him.

06:54.821 --> 06:56.922
All right, look...

06:56.990 --> 06:59.892
- I want to buy a horse.
- Uh-huh.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.861
For me and Nick to own together.

07:02.929 --> 07:04.863
- Oh!
- I found this beautiful horse.

07:04.931 --> 07:06.632
- Gorgeous!
- Right.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.300
Me and you are gonna talk the guy down.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.602
I don't know how to do that.

07:09.669 --> 07:11.202
- I'll take care of that.
- Okay.

07:12.537 --> 07:13.471
Hey-ya, Dusty.

07:13.538 --> 07:15.807
Aw, ya gotta be kidding me!

07:15.874 --> 07:16.941
How'd he find me?

07:17.009 --> 07:18.042
Who was that?

07:18.110 --> 07:20.945
Eh, don't worry about him.

07:21.013 --> 07:21.946
What do you know about horses?

07:22.014 --> 07:24.082
I know they're big.

07:24.149 --> 07:25.883
Perfect.

07:25.951 --> 07:27.584
This is a very sad case.

07:27.652 --> 07:28.919
I mean...

07:28.987 --> 07:30.087
My niece, she goes
to veterinary school.

07:30.154 --> 07:31.387
We're all very proud of her.

07:31.455 --> 07:32.689
Top of my class.

07:32.757 --> 07:34.124
So, what do you, uh, what do you think?

07:34.191 --> 07:35.425
Terrible horse.

07:35.493 --> 07:36.660
She's very sickly.

07:36.728 --> 07:39.395
- He. He... He.
- He... He.

07:39.463 --> 07:40.597
Oh!

07:40.665 --> 07:42.898
I wish I had brought my stethoscope.

07:42.966 --> 07:45.300
I'm seeing a lot of split ends.

07:45.368 --> 07:48.470
The mane is totally the wrong
cut for the shape of his face.

07:48.538 --> 07:51.774
So you're saying that this
horse, right now, the way it is,

07:51.842 --> 07:53.876
- will never race again?
- Damn it, Uncle Buck!

07:53.944 --> 07:55.811
This horse will never race again!

07:55.879 --> 07:57.379
Why did you fly me

07:57.447 --> 07:58.747
all the way out from Grenada

07:58.814 --> 08:00.135
if you weren't gonna listen to me?

08:01.984 --> 08:03.952
- Yes, con!
- Shh, shh, shh!

08:04.020 --> 08:05.386
Okay, there are people in life

08:05.454 --> 08:07.555
who you want to be unpredictable.

08:07.623 --> 08:10.956
Your pothead neighbor,
or Vice President Joe Biden.

08:11.093 --> 08:12.894
And then there are people
who you don't want

08:12.962 --> 08:14.962
to be unpredictable, like your dentist,

08:15.030 --> 08:17.364
or, I don't know, your father.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.332
Look, Nick, my dad left
when I was three.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.634
Every single day,

08:20.702 --> 08:22.736
rain or shine, he just never came back.

08:22.804 --> 08:24.371
I wish he'd been a little bit more

08:24.438 --> 08:25.706
unpredictable;
That's all I'm saying.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.541
I hear you.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.676
And yeah, sure, Walt may owe me
a couple hundred bucks,

08:29.677 --> 08:30.544
but it's not a big deal.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.344
My dad owes you money?
How much?

08:32.412 --> 08:34.380
Three, 400... like 1,100 bucks.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.082
Oh, my God, he's with Jess.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.650
He's gonna rip her off.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.318
He's gonna rip her off.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.020
I feel like Cece's making a big mistake

08:42.089 --> 08:43.589
with this Indian guy.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.059
- She should be with somebody like us.
- Totally.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.392
White Guy Power.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.863
Okay, um...

08:51.931 --> 08:53.832
- Cool Guy Power.
- Now you're talking, Robby.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.261
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

08:56.267 --> 08:58.600
I mean, one billion Indian men
is a daunting foe.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.872
Suddenly I feel sympathy for Pakistan.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.674
But it's like they say,

09:02.741 --> 09:04.241
"How do you eat
an elephant, Robby?"

09:04.809 --> 09:05.843
With chopsticks.

09:05.911 --> 09:07.712
- What?
- Slowly, with chopsticks.

09:07.779 --> 09:09.046
- That's-- no-- with chopsticks?!
- In a taco.

09:09.114 --> 09:10.380
- What?
- Elephant tacos.

09:10.448 --> 09:12.116
Elephant tacos?
Who eats elephant tacos?

09:12.184 --> 09:13.684
- That's not even a saying.
- Oh.

09:13.752 --> 09:14.952
One bite at a time, Robby.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.453
- One bite at a time.
- Yes.

09:16.521 --> 09:18.555
One bite at a time.
This is what I'm thinking.

09:18.623 --> 09:21.956
I use my superior powers of
manipulation and persuasion

09:22.426 --> 09:24.027
to get Cece to take you back.

09:24.095 --> 09:27.428
Once we've neutralized
the sub-continental threat,

09:27.897 --> 09:28.898
I smite you.

09:28.966 --> 09:29.966
- What?
- What?

09:30.034 --> 09:32.568
You said you're gonna smite me?

09:32.636 --> 09:34.337
Smite-- defeat gloriously
for Cece's hand.

09:34.404 --> 09:35.738
- No, I know what it means.
- But that's someday.

09:35.772 --> 09:38.907
For now, let's scheme,
my "broheem."

09:38.975 --> 09:40.809
Okay... I just want to reiterate

09:40.877 --> 09:43.645
that I'm not on board with the smiting.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.514
- Whatever.
- But I like the "broheem" thing a lot.

09:45.548 --> 09:46.882
Let's concentrate on the broheem part.

09:46.950 --> 09:48.117
- Concentrate on... okay.
- And smite later.

09:48.184 --> 09:50.485
- Yeah, okay, yeah.
- Cheers, broheem.

09:50.553 --> 09:51.819
You got a great deal.

09:51.887 --> 09:54.355
- Good luck, Doc. - Thanks.
- Dad!

09:54.422 --> 09:56.057
- Hi, boys.
- Can I tell him?

09:56.125 --> 09:57.405
I would rather keep it a secret.

09:57.459 --> 09:58.926
Nick, your dream finally came true.

09:59.494 --> 10:01.229
We got you a horse.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.597
- It's not my dream to own a horse.
- What?

10:03.665 --> 10:05.532
Did you use my friend to buy a horse?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.734
What?
No, I swore you wanted...?

10:06.801 --> 10:07.868
Will you excuse me?
I gotta take this call.

10:07.935 --> 10:09.136
That is unbelievable, Dad.

10:09.203 --> 10:10.403
He had this whole
thing-- he was gonna

10:10.471 --> 10:11.872
name the horse "A Father's Love"
'cause you guys

10:11.939 --> 10:12.906
always wanted to have a horse together.

10:12.974 --> 10:14.207
Tell me you didn't give him money.

10:14.275 --> 10:15.976
Actually, actually,
that's a funny story

10:16.043 --> 10:19.146
because I'm actually an investor in...

10:19.213 --> 10:20.046
God!

10:20.114 --> 10:21.047
God!

10:22.116 --> 10:23.448
Walid, drop dead!

10:23.516 --> 10:24.784
Damn, Pop-Pop.

10:24.851 --> 10:25.918
- Stop calling him Pop-Pop!
- Now, listen,

10:25.986 --> 10:27.186
I already got people standing by

10:27.254 --> 10:29.755
to take the horse off our hands.

10:29.823 --> 10:32.491
Horse semen in Dubai is gold.

10:32.558 --> 10:34.493
No, you can't sell
"A Father's Love."

10:34.560 --> 10:36.896
There's more to "A Father's Love"
than just semen.

10:36.963 --> 10:39.197
Ew, poetic, but ew.

10:39.265 --> 10:40.364
- Dad.
- Dusty, I see you

10:40.432 --> 10:42.100
and we're doing this right now.

10:42.168 --> 10:44.402
- No, no, no, no, no...!
- Dusty!

10:44.469 --> 10:46.271
We got your back, Pop-Pop.

10:46.338 --> 10:47.471
Damn, Pop-Pop, man.

10:47.539 --> 10:48.907
Give me that.

10:48.974 --> 10:51.409
Okay, okay, okay!

10:51.476 --> 10:53.577
Father, we got your back, Father.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.689
Five hundred dollars?

10:56.757 --> 10:59.159
You stole $500 from her
to buy that horse?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.527
I didn't steal anything from her.

11:01.595 --> 11:04.363
She saw the opportunity
for a business investment,

11:04.431 --> 11:05.697
and she took advantage of it.
I mean...

11:05.765 --> 11:07.299
Dad, she will believe anything.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.500
That's not true, Nick.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.936
- My real name is Jamil.
- It is?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.671
No, my name is not Jamil!

11:12.738 --> 11:14.106
- Nick, that was not fair.
- It is Nick, you know that!

11:14.174 --> 11:15.341
You told me in confidence.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.042
How could you think my name was Jamil?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.444
- Well, he's weird.
- That's a good point.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.544
Just wait for one hour.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.945
You see, I go meet the buyer,

11:21.013 --> 11:23.881
I sell them our horse
for a huge profit,

11:23.949 --> 11:25.649
and because these suckers
think our horse

11:25.717 --> 11:27.852
is Big Brown's nephew, they'll overpay.

11:28.419 --> 11:30.554
Blue Eyes gets her money back
with interest.

11:30.622 --> 11:32.190
Sounds like a great plan.
We'll come with you.

11:32.257 --> 11:34.359
And I'll watch you give
Jess her money back.

11:34.926 --> 11:35.793
Yeah!

11:35.861 --> 11:36.994
Please, please, don't do this to me.

11:37.028 --> 11:38.028
We're doing it.
No, no, you...

11:38.096 --> 11:39.162
You don't understand,

11:39.230 --> 11:40.297
you're not a sales guy, okay?

11:40.365 --> 11:41.898
He... he starts to sweat.

11:41.966 --> 11:44.234
Nick only sweats
if there's lying involved.

11:44.302 --> 11:45.935
And there's not lying
involved, is there?

11:48.191 --> 11:49.572
We're coming with, Dad.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.840
Check this out.

11:50.908 --> 11:52.209
- We get seersucker suits...
- Yeah.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.910
And two more guys,

11:53.978 --> 11:56.045
and then we serenade her
with a barbershop quartet.

11:56.113 --> 11:57.714
Well, if we got
ten more guys and a plan,

11:58.481 --> 11:59.749
we'd form an Ocean's Twelve.

11:59.817 --> 12:02.318
I would be Brad Pitt,
you'd be the crafty Asian fellow

12:02.319 --> 12:04.988
- who does the, uh, who does the flippies.
- Oh, I got a great idea.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.389
We can name a star
after her, all right?

12:06.456 --> 12:08.496
I know this Web site,
and we could put one

12:08.497 --> 12:10.258
that's right near the
Robbies one through eight.

12:10.326 --> 12:11.327
You have eight stars?

12:11.328 --> 12:12.327
There's, like, a billion
stars, they're really cheap.

12:12.395 --> 12:14.129
- But eight of them are yours?
- That's only going to go up in value.

12:14.196 --> 12:15.664
It's a horrible investment.

12:15.732 --> 12:17.332
I know she's into that Gandhi crapola.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.700
We could self-immolate.

12:18.768 --> 12:20.468
- I feel like we're so close.
- Wait, Robby.

12:20.537 --> 12:22.838
I got it.

12:22.906 --> 12:24.339
Cool... Guy... Power!

12:24.407 --> 12:26.408
Cool... Guy... Power!

12:26.475 --> 12:27.975
Cool Guy Power! Cool Guy Power!

12:28.044 --> 12:29.310
Cool-- hey.

12:29.378 --> 12:31.646
- Is this happening?
- Yes.

12:31.713 --> 12:33.014
Why are the two of you even together?

12:33.082 --> 12:34.249
Are you wearing a traditional sari?

12:34.316 --> 12:36.384
- Yes.
- I begged you to wear a sari.

12:36.452 --> 12:38.653
I had all these sari-related
sexual scenarios.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.188
- Shh!
- "Monsoon Bedding."

12:40.256 --> 12:42.656
"The Best Erotic
Mari-bone Hotel."

12:42.723 --> 12:44.958
- Stop that.
- "Slum-Doggy-Style Millionaire"

12:44.976 --> 12:46.102
But, what, you're wearing
the sari for who?

12:46.103 --> 12:47.227
Let me see this guy.

12:47.295 --> 12:49.296
- No! What... Schmidt! Robby!
- You're wearing it for him...

12:49.364 --> 12:52.299
Oh, my God.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.501
- Are you... you're having an orgy here?
- Mm-mm.

12:54.569 --> 12:56.570
- This is a big Indian orgy?
- Oh, for God sakes.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.571
- They're all wearing their clothes...
- I'm telling you, it's an orgy.

12:58.638 --> 13:01.174
Pavun and I can't go on a date
until our families...

13:02.241 --> 13:03.276
meet.

13:03.343 --> 13:05.263
- We saw you on a date earlier.
- That wasn't a date.

13:05.311 --> 13:07.580
I was meeting Pavun's uncle, Manish.

13:07.647 --> 13:08.681
Manish.

13:08.748 --> 13:12.081
That is Pavun.

13:12.318 --> 13:14.620
Oh, that's Pavun. Oh, my God,
look at this guy, he's gorgeous.

13:14.688 --> 13:16.321
What are you talking about?

13:16.389 --> 13:17.222
I don't have a chance here.
Look at his features.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.290
Look at your features, man.

13:18.357 --> 13:19.317
You're just as gorgeous.

13:19.358 --> 13:20.491
I mean, kind of.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.760
You're kind, you always have gum...

13:23.328 --> 13:24.762
and you've got so much pep.

13:24.830 --> 13:25.730
You know what, You are confident,

13:25.798 --> 13:26.864
and you're punctual,

13:26.932 --> 13:28.132
and you came up with this awesome plan.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.201
Yeah, we came up with
this awesome plan.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.352
Together.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.436
You know what, screw it,
I don't even care anymore.

13:32.504 --> 13:33.170
White Guy Power!

13:33.238 --> 13:34.438
- That's "white guy."
- All right, man.

13:34.506 --> 13:36.974
Let's do it. All right.
White Guy Power.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.875
You got to quit it with that, man.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.010
I'm telling you, it's a little racist.

13:40.078 --> 13:41.511
Get out of here before I throw you out.

13:41.579 --> 13:43.246
- All right.
- He is so organized, you know?

13:43.314 --> 13:44.681
I am just... I'm learning a ton.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.156
I'm ready for this.
This is good.

13:53.257 --> 13:54.157
This is really exciting.

13:54.225 --> 13:55.258
This is my first

13:55.259 --> 13:57.439
middle of the night
parking lot horse deal.

13:58.962 --> 14:00.196
This is not gonna work,
they're gonna...

14:00.264 --> 14:01.564
It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.166
- Gonna work fine.
- Take control of this, please.

14:03.234 --> 14:05.701
- I got it, I got it. Yes.
- We got it. We got it, Walt.

14:05.769 --> 14:07.437
Hey, look, will you do me
a favor, please?

14:07.505 --> 14:09.671
Let me handle this.
Just because my dad is in town,

14:09.739 --> 14:10.839
I'm not gonna put you in harm's way.

14:11.156 --> 14:12.924
Yup. Okay.

14:12.992 --> 14:13.925
Twist my arm.

14:13.993 --> 14:15.827
I'll be the lookout.

14:15.895 --> 14:17.295
Just keep your head down.

14:17.363 --> 14:19.163
I've got this totally under control.

14:25.469 --> 14:26.970
Hi-ya, fellas.

14:27.038 --> 14:28.873
- How you doing?
- Eh, I'm good. You?

14:28.940 --> 14:30.107
I'm good.

14:30.674 --> 14:32.309
Just getting over a little cold.

14:32.377 --> 14:34.978
Yeah, I get a little agita
myself every once in a while.

14:35.046 --> 14:36.380
Hey, what's going on, everybody?
How you guys doing?

14:36.448 --> 14:37.247
Nice to see you.
This is my dad; I'm Nick.

14:37.315 --> 14:38.348
Cool half-turtleneck.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.384
- How you doing, fellas?
- Good.

14:40.451 --> 14:41.350
Just getting over a little cold.

14:41.419 --> 14:42.852
Good.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.521
He makes the white?

14:44.588 --> 14:46.289
This horse is more
semen than he is horse.

14:47.758 --> 14:48.725
That's disgusting.

14:48.793 --> 14:51.027
Good. We want semen.

14:51.094 --> 14:53.863
Well, you guys are gonna get semen.

14:53.931 --> 14:56.865
You'll get a bunch of horse semen.

14:58.501 --> 15:00.569
Wait until it's next to a lady horse.

15:00.637 --> 15:02.237
Trust me.

15:02.305 --> 15:04.640
What's the matter? Is sweat?

15:04.707 --> 15:06.374
I don't see sweating.
He's not sweating.

15:06.443 --> 15:07.443
Why he sweating so much?

15:07.510 --> 15:08.577
No, no, no, I don't sweat too much.

15:08.645 --> 15:09.611
Why is... are you a cop?

15:09.679 --> 15:10.646
- Cop?
- No, no, no, no!

15:10.713 --> 15:11.580
Sweat like a cop.

15:11.648 --> 15:13.113
Take off your clothes.

15:13.181 --> 15:15.817
- Why would I do that?
- Aw, just take off your clothes.

15:15.884 --> 15:16.852
Take it now.

15:16.853 --> 15:17.819
He just wants to see that
you're not wearing a wire.

15:17.886 --> 15:18.820
I would like you to defend me here.

15:18.887 --> 15:20.220
Now! Take it off!

15:20.288 --> 15:22.056
- Take it off.
- No.

15:22.123 --> 15:23.491
- Now! Take it off!
- Take off your clothes!

15:23.559 --> 15:25.726
Take off your clothes!

15:25.794 --> 15:27.027
Take off your belt!

15:27.095 --> 15:28.829
Take off your belt.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.564
Now, dance.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.408
Turn around. Turn around.

15:42.477 --> 15:43.844
Okay, okay, okay.

15:43.911 --> 15:45.043
All right, all right, all right.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.712
Yeah, look, look, He's got no wire.

15:46.780 --> 15:47.780
He's not... he's not

15:47.848 --> 15:48.881
a policeman, he's...

15:48.949 --> 15:50.583
Guys, I'm not wearing a wire.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.117
I'm not a cop.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.853
I just sweat like this when I'm lying.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.820
Lying?

15:54.888 --> 15:55.921
- Lying?
- No.

15:55.989 --> 15:56.956
- Nobody is lying.
- No...

15:57.023 --> 15:58.023
You lying to me?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.658
Tire iron! Tire iron!

15:59.726 --> 16:01.125
You're lying!

16:06.264 --> 16:07.499
What is he doing?

16:07.566 --> 16:09.000
The... the gum!

16:09.067 --> 16:10.735
The gum had sugar in it.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.236
These guys are weird.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.571
Weird.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.606
Strange!

16:14.673 --> 16:15.439
You're weird.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.956
Now you have to talk to each other!

16:35.059 --> 16:37.027
You've been conned.

16:37.094 --> 16:38.294
God, I'm good.

16:38.362 --> 16:39.462
That's not a con, Jess!

16:39.530 --> 16:40.963
You're just driving away.

16:43.425 --> 16:44.841
I was ready to get your friend's money

16:44.909 --> 16:46.543
back for her, okay?

16:46.611 --> 16:47.611
But you insisted on coming here.

16:48.179 --> 16:49.212
You know what?

16:49.279 --> 16:50.680
You know what's funny about you?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.615
Somehow, you have made this...

16:52.683 --> 16:54.751
seem like my fault.

16:54.819 --> 16:56.719
This isn't my fault!

16:56.753 --> 16:58.220
I didn't invite you here!

16:59.555 --> 17:01.556
Keep talking.

17:01.624 --> 17:03.658
This is good for you guys.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.695
Are you angry at me
about something, Little Penis?

17:07.763 --> 17:11.097
I have been mad at you
for 30 years, Dad.

17:12.067 --> 17:15.368
- 30 years?
- I am not a successful adult.

17:15.436 --> 17:18.770
I don't eat vegetables
and/or take care of myself.

17:19.641 --> 17:21.508
And it's because of you.

17:21.976 --> 17:24.278
Well, okay, maybe I'll take
a little bit of that hit.

17:24.346 --> 17:26.047
Look, it's not "taking a hit."

17:27.949 --> 17:30.250
It's just saying sorry.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.650
I think you look cold.
I'm gonna give you my pants.

17:34.222 --> 17:35.989
- I don't want your pants.
- Come on, take the pants!

17:36.057 --> 17:38.024
- Dad, please don't do that.
- You say I do nothing for you.

17:38.092 --> 17:39.793
- Let me give you my pants.
- I don't want your pants!

17:39.861 --> 17:41.261
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

17:41.262 --> 17:42.695
Take my pants.

17:43.864 --> 17:45.597
This is making it worse!

17:48.902 --> 17:50.269
Dad, the...

17:52.239 --> 17:53.372
This is ridiculous.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.008
Okay.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.179
All right, maybe, uh...

18:01.747 --> 18:04.580
maybe I did make some mistakes
along the line, okay?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.691
We all make mistakes, Dad.

18:14.959 --> 18:17.027
Hey, what do you say, tomorrow,
we go to a game?

18:17.095 --> 18:18.695
Any game, you pick it out.

18:19.263 --> 18:21.031
I'm in.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.802
You're welcome!
Son of a...

18:24.869 --> 18:27.604
This thing doesn't turn so well.

18:27.672 --> 18:30.007
Do you think Cece and
Pavun will make it?

18:30.074 --> 18:31.208
I don't know.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.775
Really can't say.

18:32.843 --> 18:34.643
What I can say is that
one arranged marriage

18:34.711 --> 18:35.812
did take place today.

18:35.879 --> 18:37.980
The marriage of Schmidt and Robby.

18:38.048 --> 18:40.783
Hell, yeah.

18:40.851 --> 18:43.119
I only dread the day
that we defeat all the Indians,

18:43.187 --> 18:45.521
and must face each other
in a duel to the death.

18:45.588 --> 18:46.923
Yeah.

18:46.990 --> 18:49.191
Buzz kill.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.593
We're like Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

18:51.661 --> 18:53.661
Except only one of us dies
at the end of the movie.

18:54.464 --> 18:55.531
It's gonna be you.

18:55.598 --> 18:57.433
You're the one that's gonna die.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.235
- You want another beer?
- Sure do, compadre.

19:03.072 --> 19:04.505
Hey, Walt.

19:04.573 --> 19:05.506
What are you doing?

19:05.574 --> 19:06.655
I thought you were gonna go

19:06.675 --> 19:07.742
to a game with Nick today.

19:07.810 --> 19:09.176
Going to get a bagel.

19:09.244 --> 19:10.244
In Chicago.

19:10.312 --> 19:12.347
No! No, I can't...

19:12.414 --> 19:14.549
No. Um, I can't let you go.

19:14.616 --> 19:15.550
This means too much to Nick.

19:15.617 --> 19:17.184
You can't just say

19:17.252 --> 19:18.285
you're gonna do things
and then not do them.

19:18.354 --> 19:19.487
- What was that?
- What was what?

19:19.555 --> 19:20.920
- That.
- What? What?

19:24.258 --> 19:26.092
Damn, you're good.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.662
Listen, Blue Eyes,
do me a favor, will ya?

19:28.730 --> 19:30.697
Will you tell him for me that I, uh...

19:32.266 --> 19:34.100
You know, that I...

19:34.168 --> 19:36.536
Just keep an eye
on him for me, will ya?

19:45.812 --> 19:47.413
Jess, if you're gonna mess
with my sink,

19:47.481 --> 19:48.748
put some goggles on.

19:48.815 --> 19:50.016
Your eyes are twice the size

19:50.084 --> 19:51.817
of normal eyes;
It's a bigger target.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.088
Walt's gone.

19:57.790 --> 19:58.990
I know how hard

19:59.057 --> 20:01.692
it was for you to talk
to him, and I just...

20:01.760 --> 20:05.093
some people, I just
don't under... they just-- aah!

20:06.365 --> 20:08.933
And I understand why you want
to break pipes now.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.535
Let's just drink a bunch
and destroy the sink.

20:11.603 --> 20:14.936
I don't need to break
the pipes, Jess; I'm fine.

20:15.472 --> 20:17.707
I mean, truth be told,
I was happy to see him.

20:17.775 --> 20:19.809
I thought if you talked
to him that maybe...

20:19.877 --> 20:21.144
No... Look, Jess...

20:21.212 --> 20:22.845
people don't change.

20:22.914 --> 20:25.215
If someone's broken,
they just stay broken.

20:25.283 --> 20:27.150
You're not broken.

20:27.998 --> 20:29.719
I'm a little broken.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.453
- No, no, no... no.
- Oh, yeah.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.888
You should be so much worse.

20:32.956 --> 20:35.124
Seriously, you could be
picking up calls on a banana.

20:35.691 --> 20:36.558
You could be, like,

20:36.626 --> 20:37.659
"Hello?"

20:37.727 --> 20:40.095
I don't know how you made it out.

20:40.163 --> 20:43.432
But... you're good.

20:46.336 --> 20:48.369
Well, look, there's a
lot I don't tell you.

20:48.437 --> 20:51.105
I haven't done laundry in five months.

20:51.673 --> 20:53.074
I'm not wearing underwear.

20:53.142 --> 20:55.609
- I'm just wearing a big sock right now.
- Really.

20:55.677 --> 20:58.313
A <i>big</i> sock.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.014
- A very big sock.
- I got it.

21:01.716 --> 21:03.051
What do you think about this?

21:03.118 --> 21:04.318
We get a three-person canoe,
okay?

21:04.385 --> 21:06.720
Then we got to her house
and we rap on the door.

21:06.788 --> 21:08.355
She answers the door,
she sees the three-person canoe.

21:08.423 --> 21:10.090
She realizes there's only two of us,

21:10.158 --> 21:13.491
and we say, "Ah, what a
conundrum. Please join us."

21:14.028 --> 21:15.963
How about this one? We get
some night-vision goggles.

21:16.030 --> 21:17.698
All right, that's all I got.

21:17.766 --> 21:19.087
I don't... I don't
know what else.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.700
I mean, I would say
Trojan horse, but...

21:20.768 --> 21:21.902
In this economy?

21:21.903 --> 21:23.035
I mean, we could always
go on a hunger strike.

21:23.103 --> 21:26.472
We enlist in the Navy, we
quickly rise through the ranks,

21:26.539 --> 21:28.540
and then we can take her
to the Naval Officer's Ball.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.541
Feel like we're right there!
