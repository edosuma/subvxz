00:19.936 --> 00:21.312
[Ram Dass]  We are...

00:22.480 --> 00:23.898
soul.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.821
As souls...

00:31.448 --> 00:34.075
we are not under...

00:36.077 --> 00:38.705
time or space.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.499
We are...

00:45.295 --> 00:47.130
We are infinite.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.426
[wind blowing]

01:02.187 --> 01:04.022
[Ram Dass on recording]
Try following your breath.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.859
And every time any thought arises...

01:15.408 --> 01:17.452
notice it and then go back to the breath.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.341
Each time your awareness
is drawn away from the breath,

01:32.050 --> 01:34.511
to a thought or a sensation...

01:35.512 --> 01:37.305
to a memory or a plan...

01:39.682 --> 01:43.186
to a sensation in your leg
or a sound in the room,

01:43.269 --> 01:45.522
notice that it has gone away
from the breath,

01:45.605 --> 01:47.148
and bring it back to breath.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.951
Now, you don't have to keep
your eyes closed to do this.

01:58.326 --> 02:02.080
Try opening your eyes,
but keep the breath the focus.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.925
Let it all be there.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.512
Don't be busy not seeing
or not thinking...

02:23.309 --> 02:26.521
[chime dings]

02:37.490 --> 02:38.992
[birds chirping faintly]

02:44.164 --> 02:48.877
[Ram Dass]  My guru hangs out
at this place.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.880
[breathing heavily]

02:56.092 --> 02:58.595
It seems to be the holy ground...

02:59.387 --> 03:00.555
holy ground.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.937
I feel this place like that.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.566
It's one step from India.

03:14.944 --> 03:18.364
Maui is a refuge.

03:25.997 --> 03:30.251
It's away from the hustle and bustle.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.755
All my life, I've been...

03:34.339 --> 03:37.759
going city to city to city
on speaking tours.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.181
It's a good place to stop.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.768
No more planes.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.190
I'm going nowhere.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.193
Going nowhere.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.158
Up here in my study...

04:03.368 --> 04:05.119
it's a bird's view.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.665
It's a birds view.

04:10.375 --> 04:15.088
They fly. They do pirouettes.
They do all kinds of things.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.466
And I see. I hear.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.767
[waves crashing]

04:30.728 --> 04:32.146
I love the ocean.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.442
I think of where the ocean goes.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.861
Everywhere.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405
Everywhere.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.800
The wind here is the trade winds.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.679
And they keep it cool.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.392
And their sound is in the trees.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.812
[wind blowing]

05:15.440 --> 05:17.608
Nature is my friend.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.155
And that just gives me the ambiance.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.752
In Maui...

05:39.130 --> 05:42.675
I'm just doing a stage of my...

05:43.801 --> 05:46.888
Sadhana, my spiritual work.

05:48.431 --> 05:52.685
More and more love, more and more love,
more and more love.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.696
Truth, love...

06:06.032 --> 06:07.533
consciousness.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.204
That's what God is to me.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.625
It's just consciousness.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.504
[metal cranking]

06:25.802 --> 06:32.642
My life has been a dance
between power and love.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.354
The first part...

06:38.481 --> 06:40.983
until Harvard,

06:41.067 --> 06:43.778
power, power, power, power.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.993
[motorcycle engine rumbling]

06:53.955 --> 06:55.915
Up until drugs...

06:58.000 --> 07:02.672
I thought power was end-all and be-all...

07:05.049 --> 07:08.678
because I was a little individual.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.438
Then drugs and on...

07:18.896 --> 07:20.648
[motorcycle engine rumbling]

07:24.318 --> 07:25.778
[engine stops]

07:28.197 --> 07:29.782
[wind howling]

07:31.325 --> 07:33.494
...love, love, love, love.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.544
My first mushroom trip...

07:42.086 --> 07:46.215
it was so profound that I saw that...

07:47.383 --> 07:49.343
radiance was inside.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.139
And I said...

07:54.098 --> 07:56.350
"I'm home. I'm home. I'm home."

07:59.604 --> 08:03.900
My life was from roles...

08:06.068 --> 08:06.903
to soul.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.949
[metal cranking]

08:51.322 --> 08:53.157
[typing]

08:58.454 --> 08:59.997
[Ram Dass on recording]  The great way

09:00.081 --> 09:03.960
is not difficult
for those who have no preferences.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.639
I know nothin' about the future.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.246
[Ram Dass]  Before the stroke,

09:40.955 --> 09:47.044
I had written a book that was called
How Can I Help?

09:47.503 --> 09:49.672
And it was about helping.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.716
I was gonna help, you know?

09:55.469 --> 09:56.929
After the stroke...

10:00.641 --> 10:03.102
I would have titled the book...

10:04.770 --> 10:06.772
How Can You Help Me?

10:10.985 --> 10:14.780
In this culture, dependency is a no-no.

10:18.909 --> 10:24.373
The stroke showed me dependency.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.838
And I have people that are dependable.

10:33.966 --> 10:38.220
My stroke makes it hard to play the cello.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.681
It's difficult to play golf.

10:41.766 --> 10:46.228
Those are out there and I'm in here.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.567
-[harmonium playing]
-[man vocalizing]

10:54.362 --> 11:00.785
The stroke pushed me inside even more...

11:01.827 --> 11:04.497
and it's so wonderful.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.582
[laughs]

11:13.881 --> 11:17.718
I don't wish you the stroke, but...

11:17.802 --> 11:22.181
I wish you the grace from the stroke.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.230
[caretaker singing "Sita Ram"]

11:33.943 --> 11:40.116
My guru told me that the stroke
would be grace.

11:47.498 --> 11:51.168
When I met Maharaj-ji...

11:53.838 --> 11:55.923
it was unconditional love.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.389
It was wonderful to be loved that way.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.686
And I said, "I'm home. I'm home."

12:14.483 --> 12:19.029
A guru is the doorway to God...

12:22.491 --> 12:28.581
to consciousness, to the One, Ram.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.167
[continues singing "Sita Ram"]

12:38.883 --> 12:40.676
With psychedelics,

12:40.760 --> 12:45.723
Maharaj-ji said you could go into the room

12:46.307 --> 12:52.688
in which Christ and Buddha exist.

12:55.024 --> 13:00.613
But you only stay... a few minutes.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.323
A few minutes.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.871
[continues singing "Sita Ram"]

13:10.206 --> 13:14.418
[Ram Dass on recording]
Every time I would sit with Maharaj-ji,

13:14.502 --> 13:15.711
time would stop.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.759
It was like a moment expanded.

13:34.063 --> 13:37.691
He lived in eternity.

14:25.072 --> 14:29.702
[Ram Dass]  Most of what we encounter
are thoughts.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.912
[thunder rumbling]

14:39.795 --> 14:43.424
I project not only the names, but values.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.346
So that's around, judging everything.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.577
Without those projections...

15:12.578 --> 15:15.247
I can see everything.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.687

Life is but a dream.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.373
The incarnation is a dream.

15:59.291 --> 16:04.838
This incarnation suggests
there are other incarnations.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.178
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...

16:12.471 --> 16:15.808
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...

16:18.060 --> 16:22.773
People don't seem to know
that they are a soul...

16:24.316 --> 16:30.698
that their consciousness
goes way farther than the incarnation.

16:36.829 --> 16:43.127
We pinch ourselves to know we're alive...

16:44.670 --> 16:46.088
in this life.

16:51.635 --> 16:55.681
The soul is in the heart level.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.184
That's the entry point.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.814
And then you mantra...

17:05.523 --> 17:08.109
[chanting]  I am loving awareness.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.405
I am loving awareness.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.532
I am loving awareness.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.411
I am loving awareness.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.122
I am loving awareness.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.750
I am loving awareness.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.252
I am loving awareness.

17:26.712 --> 17:31.759
Identify with loving awareness,

17:33.260 --> 17:36.680
and then go through the veil...

17:39.516 --> 17:41.769
that consciousness veil.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.616
Going through that veil

17:56.366 --> 17:59.036
is part of...

18:01.580 --> 18:02.956
spiritual practice...

18:09.129 --> 18:12.466
and the main part of dying.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.301
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...

Life is but a dream.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.057
[chime dings]

19:18.031 --> 19:21.118
Make friends with change.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.372
[doctor] And stay breathing.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.627
[Ram Dass]  There's change
in the body, strength.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.841
Memory.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.304
Death is change.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.848
Just another one.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.017
Just another one.

19:48.395 --> 19:53.358
If you're identified with your soul,
death is a snap.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.445
The soul...

19:59.198 --> 20:00.824
goes...

20:00.908 --> 20:03.202
birth, death, birth, death.

20:07.372 --> 20:11.460
Death is another step towards home.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.945
Okay.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.947
And how is this side, Ram Dass?

20:40.030 --> 20:42.491
-It's... It's okay.
-It's okay.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.661
-Oh, wait a minute.
-You're gonna retract that statement?

20:45.744 --> 20:48.080
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-It was okay.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.164
I give up.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.754
[Ram Dass on recording]  I realize
it's presumptuous to talk about death,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.923
as if I know.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.466
[audience laughing]

20:59.549 --> 21:01.718
[Ram Dass]  But I have a lot of hutzpah.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.222
-That's Sanskrit for, uh...
-[audience laughing]

21:10.310 --> 21:14.147
[Ram Dass]  And something has happened
to me as a result of my meanderings

21:14.231 --> 21:17.693
through the realms of consciousness
over the past 30 years...

21:18.443 --> 21:21.363
that has changed my attitudes
towards death.

21:22.572 --> 21:26.285
A lot of the fear that death generated
that led to denial

21:27.077 --> 21:28.829
has gone from me.

21:30.622 --> 21:36.211
Death does not have to be treated
as an enemy for you to delight in life.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.339
Keeping death present
in your consciousness,

21:39.423 --> 21:41.967
as one of the greatest mysteries,

21:42.050 --> 21:45.762
and as the moment
of incredible transformation,

21:46.888 --> 21:51.393
imbues this moment with added richness

21:52.060 --> 21:56.023
and energy that otherwise
is used up in denial.

21:57.983 --> 22:02.362
Death is not an error.
It is not a failure.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.491
It is taking off a tight shoe.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.164
I'm one of the strange people

22:13.248 --> 22:17.753
that absolutely delights and enjoys
being with people as they're dying,

22:18.795 --> 22:21.048
because I know
I'm going to have an opportunity

22:21.131 --> 22:23.216
to be in the presence of truth.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.221
So when I sit with somebody,
the first thing I have to do

22:28.305 --> 22:32.100
is open myself to all my reactions
to their predicament.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.270
All of it, all of the pain of it.

22:35.353 --> 22:38.148
Grieve for the other person's loss.

22:39.316 --> 22:43.320
And when they feel heard in the grief,

22:43.403 --> 22:46.114
then we can start to meet
behind the grief.

22:48.325 --> 22:52.370
And I'm faced with the paradox that I,

22:52.454 --> 22:56.458
as a human, with a human emotional heart,
want to take away your suffering.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.376
And at the same moment,

22:58.460 --> 23:01.922
there's another part of me
that understands that suffering is grace,

23:02.839 --> 23:06.218
that suffering is the sandpaper,
from the spiritual point of view,

23:06.301 --> 23:07.928
that is awakening people.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.097
And once you've started
to spiritually awaken,

23:10.180 --> 23:12.474
you re-perceive your own suffering

23:12.557 --> 23:16.311
and start to work with it
as a vehicle for awakening.

23:20.482 --> 23:24.361
As my guru says, "God comes to the hungry
in the form of food."

24:11.366 --> 24:13.702
[Ram Dass]  My name...

24:15.120 --> 24:17.289
is a name for Hanuman.

24:27.757 --> 24:32.637
Hanuman... is a loving servant.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.184
The Hanuman garden...

24:39.352 --> 24:42.522
is where Hanuman hangs out.

24:43.815 --> 24:47.736
Hanuman likes vegetation around him.

24:47.819 --> 24:53.033
He's a child of nature...

24:53.116 --> 24:58.288
and I contact him there.

25:01.833 --> 25:06.046
I mistake his words...

25:08.381 --> 25:10.383
by the quiet.

25:17.849 --> 25:22.771
Ram said to Hanuman,
"What are you, monkey?"

25:25.690 --> 25:27.651
And Hanuman answered,

25:30.862 --> 25:35.617
"When I don't know who I am, I serve you.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.122
When I know who I am,

25:42.874 --> 25:44.668
I am you."

26:03.478 --> 26:05.021
[indistinct chatter]

26:19.202 --> 26:21.246
We've lived longer than we think.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.460
You're traveling through lives.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.761
What did you learn...

26:38.054 --> 26:39.764
in this life?

26:54.154 --> 26:56.072
Considerable joy.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.825
Considerable joy.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.711
[inaudible]

27:21.056 --> 27:26.144
When you're in your soul
and you love something,

27:26.227 --> 27:31.608
and the things become melding, melding...

27:36.279 --> 27:41.534
So you love something
and you become one with it.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.662
[sighs]

27:47.957 --> 27:51.169
All of us... one.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.384
All of us, one.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.637
Yeah.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.141
One consciousness.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.061
One consciousness.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.274
And that's the way in which the world...

28:16.778 --> 28:18.780
could right itself.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.994
Start with your peace,

28:25.078 --> 28:25.912
your love,

28:26.871 --> 28:28.581
your compassion,

28:28.665 --> 28:30.125
and go from there.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.378
And then...

28:35.004 --> 28:36.548
love everything.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.925
Everything.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.737
Let's all...

29:00.572 --> 29:02.490
walk each other...

29:03.283 --> 29:04.451
home.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.918
