WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:08.876
( music playing )

00:11.918 --> 00:14.042
( overlapping chattering )

00:14.083 --> 00:15.876
Woman:
Mothers against picketing!

00:15.918 --> 00:17.459
Please sign.

00:17.501 --> 00:19.083
Man:
Free the whales.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.125
Man #2:
Incarcerate the whales.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.292
I gotta--

00:23.334 --> 00:24.667
Okay, whoa.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.876
Man #3:
Gay marriage.

00:26.918 --> 00:28.792
Gay divorce.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.542
Woman #2:
Make petitioning illegal!

00:33.417 --> 00:34.876
Hi, can I help you?

00:34.918 --> 00:36.167
- Hmm.
- Oh!

00:36.209 --> 00:37.209
- The pickles.
- Oh, the pickles.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.459
Yeah, those are good.

00:38.501 --> 00:39.542
- There you go.
- Thank you.

00:39.584 --> 00:42.542
Oh, by the way,
I'm giving 50% off Brazilian,

00:42.584 --> 00:45.375
and 75% off Ecuadorians.

00:45.417 --> 00:47.542
- Yeah, no.
- Okay, so, the wax is curdling.

00:47.584 --> 00:49.542
So I've got
to get to it real, real fast.

00:49.584 --> 00:52.375
So if you want to bring your mom,
I can do that.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.542
I love mother and daughter stuff!

00:54.584 --> 00:56.125
Man: Harder.

00:56.167 --> 00:59.292
Mm, really.
I thought I was doing it hard, okay.

00:59.334 --> 01:00.667
Harder.

01:00.709 --> 01:03.709
Well, you are making me
work for it, huh?

01:03.751 --> 01:05.167
Harder.

01:05.209 --> 01:07.584
All right, here I go.

01:07.626 --> 01:09.334
( yelps )

01:09.375 --> 01:12.876
Oh, wow.
That was a good release, wasn't it?

01:12.918 --> 01:15.959
- Okay, all right. That's good.
- ( moaning )

01:16.000 --> 01:19.083
Okay, you know what?
You're gonna need to drink some water.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.250
Lots of it.

01:20.292 --> 01:22.876
What is this?

01:22.918 --> 01:24.584
This is your office.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.292
Bobbie:
Yeah, well, it is now.

01:26.334 --> 01:28.626
You see, the Whole Foods,
they kicked me out

01:28.667 --> 01:31.209
while I was giving detox colonics

01:31.250 --> 01:33.375
very close to the soup tureens.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.250
- Oh, my gosh.
- ( man moans )

01:35.292 --> 01:36.792
Is he okay?

01:36.834 --> 01:40.542
- He doesn't seem okay.
- No, he's fine. He's fine, really.

01:40.584 --> 01:42.334
Just relax.
Oh, Wray, here.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.792
You pick yourself out
a spa package.

01:44.834 --> 01:47.626
Bobbie, have you negotiated
the commercial deal?

01:47.667 --> 01:48.792
It shoots tomorrow.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.667
Yeah, you know what?

01:50.709 --> 01:53.083
That thing needs
a little more work,

01:53.125 --> 01:55.876
and since I am only
a convention booker...

01:55.918 --> 01:58.501
So if you make me
your TV and movie rep,

01:58.542 --> 02:01.000
well, then,
I can give you a hand.

02:01.042 --> 02:02.626
Oh, by the way,
would you give me a hand

02:02.667 --> 02:04.584
and just flip over those links?

02:04.626 --> 02:06.501
Starting to smell
like an orphanage fire.

02:06.542 --> 02:08.000
Is this yours too?

02:09.959 --> 02:12.792
Oh, by the way, I have been
hustling for you, sir, yeah.

02:12.834 --> 02:16.667
I have got a hot scoop.

02:16.709 --> 02:19.501
Which coincidentally is a procedure
I had done last June.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.542
- ( moans )
- What is wrong with--

02:21.584 --> 02:23.250
Which one of these did he get?

02:23.292 --> 02:25.584
Can-- can you--
can you feel that?

02:25.626 --> 02:27.667
Is this at all--
can you wiggle your toes?

02:27.709 --> 02:29.292
How about this?
How about this?

02:29.334 --> 02:30.918
Hot grease!

02:30.959 --> 02:33.834
How about this?
Hot grease!

02:33.876 --> 02:35.959
I'm concerned.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.083
What the hell is
the Big Boy Mess?

02:38.125 --> 02:41.083
I happen to know
that the director of the commercial

02:41.125 --> 02:44.042
is also directing
a prestigious drama.

02:44.083 --> 02:46.209
- "Doctor Cop Lawyer."
- Yes, "Doctor Cop Lawyer"!

02:46.250 --> 02:49.542
And I have got the script!

02:49.584 --> 02:50.584
Oh, my God.

02:51.751 --> 02:53.083
Sorry.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.209
There's a great part in there,
Dr. Richard Trimmings.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.792
You'd be the gimpy sidekick.

02:57.834 --> 03:00.709
- "Gimpy sidekick"?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:00.751 --> 03:03.667
- No.
- And he's got a squinting eye.

03:03.709 --> 03:06.125
- Doctor Dick Trimmings.
- Mm-hmm.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.834
- Why are all of his S's TH's?
- Oh, he has a lisp.

03:08.876 --> 03:12.083
No, squinty-eyed,
lisp, limp, that is--

03:12.125 --> 03:14.042
I want to play the lead.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.918
Here we go.

03:15.959 --> 03:19.792
Dr. Officer Blade Slater, Esquire.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.375
Okay, Wray,
you can't play that part.

03:22.417 --> 03:25.167
You see, I've submitted myself
for the female lead

03:25.209 --> 03:27.834
and that would mean
we'd be lovers.

03:27.876 --> 03:31.834
Okay, you submitted yourself
for the 20-something ex-dancer.

03:31.876 --> 03:34.000
Yes, parts of me
are 20-something.

03:34.042 --> 03:37.125
Yeah, thanks to my hot scoop.

03:37.167 --> 03:39.042
Man: Oh, my God.
You're Wray Nerely.

03:39.083 --> 03:41.209
I will see you in Hell.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.834
You're seeing it, right now.
This is Hell.

03:43.876 --> 03:45.918
Listen, okay,
whatever it takes.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.667
You're my film agent,
you're my TV agent.

03:48.709 --> 03:51.167
Oh, my God,
I thought you would never say that!

03:51.209 --> 03:52.626
I've been waiting forever!

03:52.667 --> 03:55.792
Why don't I just sign something?
This is too much.

03:55.834 --> 03:58.125
Okay, you know what?
I'm old-fashioned, so, um...

03:58.167 --> 04:00.250
here.

04:00.292 --> 04:02.375
Ow!

04:02.417 --> 04:03.709
- Yeah.
- You drew blood!

04:03.751 --> 04:04.959
Uh huh.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.083
Ouch...

04:07.334 --> 04:08.959
( grunts )

04:10.709 --> 04:13.751
Through this blood,
we are bound.

04:13.792 --> 04:14.792
( thunder cracks )

04:14.834 --> 04:16.625
You know what?
That hurt.

04:16.666 --> 04:20.666
Oh, you have really got to man up
if you're gonna be Doctor Cop Lawyer.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.417
What is "roadside discovery flavor"?

04:23.459 --> 04:26.042
- Ugh.
- Oh, those are Wray's favorite!

04:26.083 --> 04:27.834
- Oh, okay.
- You should buy a few boxes.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.918
Ahh... ooh...

04:29.959 --> 04:32.167
Here you go, Wray.
And Gary's.

04:32.209 --> 04:33.709
Here.
Oh, ow, it's hot.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.250
"Foal prepuce."

04:40.292 --> 04:42.167
Aah!
Pony foreskin?

04:45.042 --> 04:47.083
No, that is not made
with pony foreskin.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.375
That's just the casing.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.542
Plus pig anus.

04:50.584 --> 04:51.876
Aah...

04:51.918 --> 04:53.959
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

04:57.459 --> 04:59.417
A real man
would've swallowed.

05:02.459 --> 05:04.250
Hey, yes.

05:04.292 --> 05:08.417
Look, I read the script.

05:10.250 --> 05:13.709
I love it.
I can play Doctor Cop Lawyer.

05:13.751 --> 05:16.209
Jack: You just focus
on the commercial tomorrow.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.834
You know, Diego and I
did "Sea Light" together.

05:17.876 --> 05:19.918
That was the number one movie
five weeks in a row.

05:19.959 --> 05:21.959
Dude, why don't y'all
do a sequel?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.834
Jack: I'm not doing anything
until I do "Spectrum."

05:23.876 --> 05:25.918
That's why I need you
to hit the con circuit,

05:25.959 --> 05:27.459
build a groundswell,

05:27.501 --> 05:30.501
get these fans
all excited and frothy.

05:30.542 --> 05:33.083
( expletive ) Australians.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.667
Frothy, buddy?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.167
They are already froth-- ack.

05:37.209 --> 05:40.584
They're self--
They're self-frothing.

05:40.626 --> 05:43.709
Jack: Look, we are gonna need
to make some noise

05:43.751 --> 05:45.501
if we are gonna
announce this thing

05:45.542 --> 05:47.459
at the biggest con of the year.

05:47.501 --> 05:49.542
- Wray?
- The Shock-A-Con?

05:49.584 --> 05:51.501
Well, we haven't been
invited yet,

05:51.542 --> 05:55.042
but it'd be the perfect place
to announce the project.

05:55.083 --> 05:58.000
Wray: Wow,
that would be great, man.

05:58.042 --> 06:00.292
Hey, you know what, buddy?
I gotta go.

06:00.334 --> 06:02.751
Yeah, I'll--
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.334
- Faith: Wray...
- Faith: Jack...

06:09.375 --> 06:11.626
Together: I put this letter
where I knew you'd find it.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.334
This isn't easy to say,

06:13.375 --> 06:16.709
but I think it's time
we went our separate ways.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.792
- Please understand this is not personal.
- I want to thank you for reminding me

06:18.834 --> 06:20.209
- I've started slipping into old habits...
- that I've started slipping.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.751
The old me would never
have missed a meeting.

06:21.792 --> 06:23.250
...drinking too much, et cetera.

06:23.292 --> 06:24.834
- It's gotten very old
- Yeah, it's very old fashioned

06:24.876 --> 06:26.542
- waking up hung over so often.
- to do this in a letter.

06:26.584 --> 06:28.000
- And I told you my old man
- But you're such an old man

06:28.042 --> 06:29.250
- has a problem himself--
- when it comes to technology.

06:29.292 --> 06:32.042
Oh, come on!
( muttering )

06:32.083 --> 06:36.709
Faith: Today I realized, if I'm ever going
to be more than a personal assistant,

06:36.751 --> 06:39.167
I need to make some changes.

06:39.209 --> 06:41.250
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Faith: Ah, let me see.

06:41.292 --> 06:43.375
Blah, blah, blah,
self-destructive.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.959
Blah, blah, blah,
sexual inconsistency.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.626
- Quitting isn't the easiest.
- Wray: What?

06:47.667 --> 06:49.709
- but it is the first.
- So I guess what I'm trying to say

06:49.751 --> 06:52.125
- can be summed up in one word,
- Thank you.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.584
- "over."
- It's over.

07:29.292 --> 07:31.667

"I guess what I'm trying to say
can be summed up in one word,

07:42.250 --> 07:43.709
'over.'"

07:45.542 --> 07:47.542
It's not o--
It's not over!

07:47.584 --> 07:50.292
It's not over.
I can get her back.

07:50.334 --> 07:52.834
She's not even gone.
I don't want her back.

07:52.876 --> 07:54.417
( sobs )

07:56.626 --> 07:59.709
She's a bitch.
We know that.

07:59.751 --> 08:03.125
Oh, selfish.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.501
It's me, this is me.
This is what I do.

08:05.542 --> 08:08.209
This is what I do,
and I can take that!

08:08.250 --> 08:10.501
I can own that!

08:10.542 --> 08:13.375
Not like you, you're pointing fingers,
you're gonna get fat.

08:13.417 --> 08:16.626
You're gonna get fat, and worse,
you're gonna get...

08:16.667 --> 08:20.083
thick and stout and swollen
with a big butt.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.542
Well, look who came
crawling back.

08:24.584 --> 08:27.334
I had to pick up some stuff
and drop off that letter.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.417
You couldn't text
like an adult?

08:30.459 --> 08:32.792
You didn't finish the letter.

08:34.751 --> 08:36.708
What?

08:36.751 --> 08:38.542
I think, um...

08:41.000 --> 08:43.958
"Sexual inconsistency,
so I guess what I'm trying to say

08:44.000 --> 08:48.709
can be summed up
in one word, 'over.'"

08:54.250 --> 08:55.751
Over.

08:56.751 --> 08:59.626
Oh, oh, over.

08:59.667 --> 09:03.709
"And that one word is, 'respect.'"

09:06.626 --> 09:09.834
- Okay.
- Respect.

09:09.876 --> 09:12.000
- Nope.
- Look.

09:12.042 --> 09:16.000
Ahh, "still have a future together?"
No.

09:16.042 --> 09:19.209
- What about that sixth--
- Definitely not that.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.751
- I asked for that.
- Uh, no, no, and no.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.334
- Huh?
- No.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.375
And... hard no.

09:25.417 --> 09:28.542
Remember...
Okay.

09:32.626 --> 09:33.959
"We're...

09:39.918 --> 09:41.542
Over."

09:44.417 --> 09:46.876
Who's in the mood
for some break-up sex?

09:52.209 --> 09:55.584
Dale:
Wray? Hello? Faith?

09:55.626 --> 09:58.626
Ah, are you okay?
I heard crying.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.000
Wasn't me.

10:01.042 --> 10:02.751
Oh, I see.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.792
Here's a bra
I borrowed from you.

10:04.834 --> 10:08.501
Oh, keep it.
Always looked better on you.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.125
Take care of yourself.

10:12.751 --> 10:15.626
- I've fixed your breaker.
- Thank you.

10:15.667 --> 10:20.125
- Wray, you gotta nut up.
- Dale, you gotta--

10:20.167 --> 10:23.125
You gotta nut up.
You gotta get your nuts up.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.375
Hey.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.959
I did a stunt in this skirt

10:31.000 --> 10:34.751
for the movie "The Pitfall Gamble,"

10:34.792 --> 10:36.918
doubling Beatrice Taylor.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.834
Rode a horse off a train
into a barn fire.

10:39.876 --> 10:42.918
No.
No.

10:42.959 --> 10:45.292
The train and the barn fire

10:45.334 --> 10:48.083
weren't even in the stunt.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.250
I spent nine weeks
in the hospital.

10:51.292 --> 10:54.209
The thing is, life hurts, Wray.

10:54.250 --> 10:58.626
Woman leaves you,
you feel the pain, right?

10:58.667 --> 11:00.667
Good.
Stand on that pain.

11:00.709 --> 11:04.834
You can see further, reach higher,
grab something you want.

11:04.876 --> 11:08.584
Your balls are in the salsa.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.292
'Cause that's what I want.

11:11.334 --> 11:14.584
Right now,
I want to get up, go home,

11:14.626 --> 11:17.584
and towel off my scrote.

11:17.626 --> 11:20.792
I never pegged you
for a habanero guy.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.751
I've always liked the extra spicy.

11:23.792 --> 11:26.334
Why am I tasting garlic?

11:26.375 --> 11:28.542
I don't--
I don't know.

11:28.584 --> 11:32.417
Why don't you go home, Dale?
Towel off your scrote.

11:36.751 --> 11:41.292
I don't want to hear
any more crying from you, okay?

11:41.334 --> 11:45.000
Life gives you broken bones, Wray.

11:45.042 --> 11:47.375
Uh, oh...

11:47.417 --> 11:49.083
No, Dale.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.000
- Dale!
- Don't swaddle them in bandages...

11:52.042 --> 11:54.167
- Dale!
- and coddle them...

11:54.209 --> 11:56.584
- What are you doing?
- in plaster.

11:56.626 --> 11:58.459
Stop-- be careful!

11:58.501 --> 12:01.334
- Your suffering is the...
- What are you doing?

12:01.375 --> 12:03.751
- best part of you!
- Jesus.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.250
Push!

12:05.292 --> 12:07.417
Through the pain.

12:07.459 --> 12:11.417
And you'll get everything in life
you've ever wanted.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.459
( gasps )

12:16.709 --> 12:18.417
( expletive )

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Jesus!

12:21.042 --> 12:23.042
( music playing )
