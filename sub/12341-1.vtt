00:42.786 --> 00:45.388
Ineffable loss, my friend.

00:46.856 --> 00:49.726
A tremendous abduction
from your world.

00:54.197 --> 00:56.199
She's so beautiful.

01:01.771 --> 01:03.506
I can't do it, I...

01:03.540 --> 01:04.873
can't, I can't do it.

01:06.509 --> 01:09.579
I understand your pain, Joseph.

01:09.612 --> 01:12.348
With that said, I wonder...

01:12.382 --> 01:14.784
is there a little more
to speak of?

01:24.194 --> 01:26.830
She must have been
extraordinary.

01:27.897 --> 01:31.167
I-I don't have e-enough...

01:31.201 --> 01:33.203
air in my lungs...

01:34.637 --> 01:37.240
to describe her goodness.

01:41.211 --> 01:43.179
Incredible.

01:53.723 --> 01:55.425
Joseph...

01:55.458 --> 01:57.927
as you depicted,
you seemed quite angry

01:57.961 --> 02:00.363
when it all happened.

02:01.798 --> 02:03.900
Might I ask...

02:03.933 --> 02:06.302
did you in fact stop taking

02:06.336 --> 02:08.471
your medicine before her death?

02:08.505 --> 02:09.939
No.

02:13.009 --> 02:15.678
Yeah.

02:15.712 --> 02:17.347
I did. I don't, I...

02:20.383 --> 02:23.253
I don't remember,
I don't rightly remember.

02:26.523 --> 02:29.959
I'm not takin' my medicine
now though. I know that.

02:29.993 --> 02:34.264
Yes. That would explain me.

02:34.297 --> 02:37.400
I can help you remember
everything if you'd like.

02:37.433 --> 02:38.902
Not just Annabel.

02:41.337 --> 02:43.706
I don't know if I hurt her...

02:44.374 --> 02:45.875
or not.

02:45.909 --> 02:48.244
I can answer
all your questions, Joseph.

02:48.278 --> 02:52.682
One cold plunge,
a small vow of courage.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.884
Are you certain
you won't join me?

05:24.600 --> 05:25.601
Oh, hi, there.

05:32.809 --> 05:34.177
What the hell was that?

05:34.210 --> 05:35.645
There's a murder.

05:35.678 --> 05:37.046
Excuse me?

05:37.080 --> 05:39.148
A murder of crows.

05:41.918 --> 05:43.553
Good luck, darling.

05:43.586 --> 05:45.955
It okay, Melanie. He's with me.
Thanks, Ms. Brenner.

05:45.988 --> 05:48.825
Gosh! That was some sign.
Are you okay, man?

05:48.858 --> 05:50.693
What a welcome! Christ sake.

I'm sorry, Mr. Hale...

05:57.834 --> 05:59.945
I'm sorry, Mr. Hale, that was
probably the wildest thing

05:59.969 --> 06:03.072

Are you drinking?

06:10.713 --> 06:12.815
Uh, just a little curry.
It helps me concentrate.

06:12.849 --> 06:15.051
Well, it's a bit narrow
for two, should you lead?

06:15.084 --> 06:16.986
No, I'm good if you're okay.

06:17.019 --> 06:18.821
- Okay.

06:18.855 --> 06:20.899
It's very exciting that
you're here to cover the birds.

06:20.923 --> 06:23.760

great pride in this production.

- Oh, come on.

wins the Chancellor Award for it

Mitch, that you recognize that.

little brother to bring it on.

14:16.699 --> 14:18.300
Get the fuck off of me.

14:18.334 --> 14:20.069
Now get out of my bar, boy.

14:20.102 --> 14:21.637
Get out!

14:21.670 --> 14:24.673
- You're bigger than him.
- You go.

14:24.707 --> 14:28.377
Tom, you can't just go around
fucking assaulting good people.

14:28.410 --> 14:32.114
Dane! Get the fuck
out of my bar now.

14:33.449 --> 14:35.384
Get out, you fucker.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.119
Fuck out of here.

14:39.555 --> 14:41.090
Move along!

14:44.660 --> 14:46.595
Next one's on the house, folks.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.367
- Happens.
- It happens.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.468
That didn't scare you off?

14:52.501 --> 14:55.938
No, it takes more than that.

15:46.422 --> 15:49.191
Mr. Hawthorne, Ed Hale.

15:49.224 --> 15:52.127
"San Francisco Noise."

15:52.161 --> 15:54.630
Mr. Hawthorne...

16:00.569 --> 16:02.538
Is there no merciful reprieve

16:02.571 --> 16:05.607
for good men
on Earth's dry surface?

16:05.641 --> 16:08.310
I'm getting visits.

16:08.344 --> 16:10.079
A reporter came here, said that

16:10.112 --> 16:12.681
he wanted to do a story on me.

16:14.283 --> 16:16.685
On my side of what happened.

16:16.719 --> 16:19.822
He says everybody in the town
has talked about it

16:19.855 --> 16:23.525
and I have a right
to do the same.

16:23.559 --> 16:25.461
What do you think?

16:25.494 --> 16:27.830
That's curious.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.400
I wonder, Joseph,
did you perhaps call him here?

16:35.537 --> 16:37.373
What?

16:38.307 --> 16:39.708
Why would you say that?

16:39.742 --> 16:41.343
He said the same thing.

16:41.377 --> 16:43.178
I didn't mean to imply
that you had

16:43.212 --> 16:46.682
I was simply asking because,
well, it seems rather peculiar

16:46.715 --> 16:49.084
that this gentleman
would venture all the way out

16:49.118 --> 16:50.619
here for no apparent reason.

16:50.652 --> 16:53.689
What would be his motivation?

16:53.722 --> 16:55.591
What if I called him?
What if I called him?

16:55.624 --> 16:57.860
What if I...

16:57.893 --> 17:00.796
What if I contacted...
I don't even remember.

17:00.829 --> 17:03.699
The best thing to do now
is to join me in the water

17:03.732 --> 17:07.336
this way we know the truth
and what we're up against.

17:08.771 --> 17:11.306
I don't have time for that
right now.

17:12.641 --> 17:15.611
Maybe he knows something
about Annabel.

17:15.644 --> 17:17.512
What happened that day...

17:19.548 --> 17:21.650
Why she can't rest.

17:21.683 --> 17:25.554
You haven't been back
for quite sometime.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.623
Are you certain
you're up for it?

17:35.297 --> 17:37.299
If you could swim

17:37.332 --> 17:39.201
I'd swim with you, Joseph.

17:40.836 --> 17:43.839
If I could walk,
I'd walk with you.

18:13.902 --> 18:16.171
Anybody missin' a dog?

18:19.675 --> 18:22.845
Hey... there you go.

18:26.682 --> 18:28.217
Hey.

18:38.927 --> 18:40.662
Hi.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.366
Hi.

18:46.368 --> 18:48.804
I'm sweating, I know.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.874
- It's hot out there, I'm sure.
- Yeah.

18:51.907 --> 18:54.343
I see you find my girl.

18:54.376 --> 18:55.844
Her name is Glory.

18:56.912 --> 18:59.581
She's fine. She's cool.

19:00.916 --> 19:02.618
I-is, um...

19:05.387 --> 19:07.656
I-is Dr-Dr. George...

19:07.689 --> 19:10.359
Is he in town? Is he here?

19:10.392 --> 19:11.927
George Reinhart?

19:11.960 --> 19:15.430
He moved last year.
I'm his replacement.

19:16.798 --> 19:18.567
He-he moved?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.837
That's what they tell me.
I've never met him.

19:23.572 --> 19:25.541
May I sit down for a second?

19:25.574 --> 19:27.442
Yeah.

19:32.047 --> 19:34.349
I'm Sweetie.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.886
I'm Joseph.

19:39.354 --> 19:41.890
What medications
are you on, Joseph?

19:44.693 --> 19:46.929
Lithium and others.

19:48.797 --> 19:52.000
You know what? Um, I don't...

19:52.034 --> 19:55.671
I just, I just wanted to ask him
some questions and I don't

19:55.704 --> 19:58.473
I don't really need anything.
I was hot.

19:58.507 --> 20:00.008
I was in the area.

20:00.042 --> 20:02.377
Just wanted a place
to cool down.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.813
I understand.

20:04.846 --> 20:07.749
Well, I'm a doctor, too.

20:07.783 --> 20:09.851
I can answer any question
you might have.

20:12.721 --> 20:14.890
You know, in fact I'd like to.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.658
It's really boring here today.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.466
Why don't we just start off
really nice and easy?

20:24.499 --> 20:27.035
Tell me your full name,
I can look you up in the system.

20:28.370 --> 20:29.805
We can go from there.

20:34.476 --> 20:37.379
Can you-can you give me
some water... before we start?

20:39.081 --> 20:40.682
Of course.

20:40.716 --> 20:42.050
I'll be right back.

21:01.937 --> 21:04.740
Mitch! I think you're missing
the point here.

21:04.773 --> 21:07.342
It's still an alcoholic beverage
and you're still driving.

21:07.376 --> 21:09.544
No, this is a hot toddy.

21:09.578 --> 21:11.046
- Mitch!
- It's medicine.

21:11.079 --> 21:13.582
It's basically a liquid form
of lozenge, you know?

21:13.615 --> 21:15.550
- It's lemon and honey...
- And Scotch.

21:15.584 --> 21:16.728
Yes, there's some Scotch
in there

21:16.752 --> 21:18.820
but it helps my throat.

21:18.854 --> 21:20.965
Yeah, they also say, it helps
while driving a mortar vehicle.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.557
Oh, my God. Okay, okay.

21:22.591 --> 21:24.826
Agree to disagree.
Just... You know what?

21:24.860 --> 21:26.571
Here, let me take a look
at that list, penman.

21:26.595 --> 21:28.630
I gotta... get back to the barn.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.999
I got work to do.
Okey-dokey. O-okay.

21:31.033 --> 21:33.669
So Bodega Bay pier.

21:33.702 --> 21:38.073
Lawman's bluff.
Uh, the court house?

21:38.106 --> 21:40.809
I'm sorry, maybe I'm not
the-the world's best tour guide

21:40.842 --> 21:43.378
but I didn't have any of these
places mapped out for us.

21:45.814 --> 21:48.083
I'm not here to do
the bird story.

21:48.116 --> 21:50.686
I could care less about that.

21:50.719 --> 21:52.954
I'm here to do a piece
on Joseph Hawthorne.

21:56.425 --> 21:58.894
Did you change your mind?

21:58.927 --> 22:01.363
I lied to you so you'd let me
stay at your place.

22:02.431 --> 22:03.765
I'm sorry.

22:08.136 --> 22:09.504
Mitch.

22:14.976 --> 22:17.646
Mitch.

22:17.679 --> 22:19.123
Hey, Ed, I don't wanna
talk to you right now.

22:19.147 --> 22:20.916
You need to leave me be
for a spell.

22:20.949 --> 22:22.851
No, I understand that.
Just hear me out first.

22:22.884 --> 22:26.021
No! Look that was not cool, man.
You betrayed my trust.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.889
I'm letting you stay
in my freaking house.

22:27.923 --> 22:29.758
You should have been
straight with me.

22:29.791 --> 22:32.728
You're right, there's nothing
I can say to you that's gonna

22:32.761 --> 22:35.897
excuse my dishonesty, but I
didn't have much of a choice.

22:35.931 --> 22:37.966
- What the hell was that mean?
- Full disclosure.

22:37.999 --> 22:40.969
My office received a phone call
from Joseph Hawthorne.

22:41.002 --> 22:42.871
He said he wanted to clear
his name in the town

22:42.904 --> 22:45.474
and he wanted us to do his story

22:45.507 --> 22:47.809
about him and this case.

22:47.843 --> 22:49.678
His exclusive recounting
of what happened

22:49.711 --> 22:52.047
the day his wife went missing.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.217
Listen, you-you, uh...
you need to go straight
to him with this.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.585
I can't help you with any of it.

22:56.618 --> 22:57.786
I already tried that.

22:57.819 --> 22:59.130
He doesn't remember
calling me here.

22:59.154 --> 23:00.555
How the hell would he?

23:00.589 --> 23:01.990
He's a sick man and a recluse.

23:02.023 --> 23:03.825
- Do you want his story?
- Yeah.

23:03.859 --> 23:05.703
Take him out of here like you
did with the Boiler Brothers

23:05.727 --> 23:07.129
in Indian country.

23:11.967 --> 23:14.870
Wait. H-how did you...

23:14.903 --> 23:18.907
Look, uh,
that was different, um...

23:18.940 --> 23:20.909
Those boys were in real danger.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.844
Why did you get me
involved in this?

23:22.878 --> 23:25.046
Your place is far enough away
but close enough

23:25.080 --> 23:27.082
to get what I need.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.918
Hawthorne gave my assistant
a list of caveats.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.487
And if any of these
weren't met he'd pull out

23:32.521 --> 23:34.823
and I'd lose the whole story.

23:34.856 --> 23:38.727
We could only send
one reporter and it had to me.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.195
No one can know why I'm in town

23:40.228 --> 23:43.098
and I have to come up
with another cover story.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.966
Hence, the birds.

23:46.935 --> 23:48.713
As far as run-of-the-mill
reporting goes, this hasn't

23:48.737 --> 23:50.539
exactly been a cakewalk, Mitch.

23:51.907 --> 23:53.108
Ed...

23:55.210 --> 23:57.946
when she disappeared...

23:57.979 --> 23:58.980
people lost it.

23:59.014 --> 24:00.749
I mean, this whole town divided.

24:00.782 --> 24:02.222
I mean, half of 'em
don't believe him

24:02.250 --> 24:04.252
and the other half they...

24:04.286 --> 24:06.788
they don't wanna speak
because they're...

24:06.822 --> 24:08.757
they're too afraid.

24:08.790 --> 24:10.859
What do they have
to be afraid off?

24:10.892 --> 24:13.195
Oh, I don't know, uh, Dane Baker
and Annabel's brothers

24:13.228 --> 24:14.963
Ruddi and Jack Lee.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.932
From the bar the other night?
The loud mouth?

24:16.965 --> 24:19.734
Yeah. Yeah, and that's Ruddi.

24:19.768 --> 24:22.604
Okay, if that family finds out
that you're poking around...

24:22.637 --> 24:24.606
they'll come after you.

24:24.639 --> 24:27.042
If you posture and pour any of
your intellectual cheeky logic

24:27.075 --> 24:29.044
with them, they're-they're
gonna hurt you.

24:29.077 --> 24:30.846
Alright. So help me
navigate around here.

24:30.879 --> 24:31.880
No.

24:31.913 --> 24:33.157
We'll be as delicate as possible

24:33.181 --> 24:34.683
and together, we'll be credited

24:34.716 --> 24:36.027
with hooking one of
the most intriguing

24:36.051 --> 24:37.619
stories in the last five years.

24:37.652 --> 24:39.321
- Oh, wow. No.
- Mitch.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.690
Mitch, there's a witness.

24:41.723 --> 24:43.091
Someone saw what happened

24:43.124 --> 24:45.861
but their identity,
it's been protected.

24:45.894 --> 24:47.762
This is public information.

24:49.231 --> 24:51.066
This is exciting stuff. Come on.

24:51.099 --> 24:53.235
I need fucking ally. Help me.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.681
Annabel!

26:21.323 --> 26:23.825
Annabel Lee! Don't leave!

26:24.893 --> 26:25.927
Annabel!

26:25.961 --> 26:27.829
Annabel!

26:31.199 --> 26:32.667
Annabel!

26:44.279 --> 26:46.047
That's what I'm talking about.

26:46.081 --> 26:47.458
That's what I'm sitting here
educating you of.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.751
- What's that, Joseph?
- I feel good!

26:49.784 --> 26:52.287
I feel good! Whoo!

26:52.320 --> 26:57.225
I'm powerful, I'm smart
and it's all coming together.

26:57.258 --> 26:58.994
These people...

26:59.027 --> 27:00.795
this town...

27:00.829 --> 27:03.031
my perdition,
it's all making sense now.

27:03.064 --> 27:06.001
I wish I could give you, I wish
I could give you this feeling.

27:06.034 --> 27:08.703
It's explosive.
It's absolute victory.

27:08.737 --> 27:11.840
It's Bible, it's sacrament,
it's everything!

27:13.842 --> 27:17.178
It's deserved and I'm owed this.

27:17.212 --> 27:18.413
Whoo!

27:24.085 --> 27:26.454
I want to touch you.

27:26.488 --> 27:29.224
I want to touch you.

27:29.257 --> 27:31.292
So you could...

27:31.326 --> 27:32.761
so you could feel it.

27:32.794 --> 27:34.362
I wanna transfer

27:34.396 --> 27:36.831
this fucking lightning storm
so you could feel

27:36.865 --> 27:38.933
what I feel, what I can!
You know why?

27:38.967 --> 27:40.402
Because you would burn!

27:40.435 --> 27:42.771
Oh, baby, you would burn!

27:45.306 --> 27:47.108
You would burn so hot

27:47.142 --> 27:49.944
and for so long...

27:49.978 --> 27:51.913
that I have to bring you back.

27:51.946 --> 27:53.948
That's what happened to her.

27:54.449 --> 27:56.484
The sea...

27:56.518 --> 27:59.054
took her... from me.

28:01.156 --> 28:04.793
So he could bathe in her
luminance and crown her...

28:04.826 --> 28:06.361
my queen.

28:09.130 --> 28:10.965
Come here.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.367
Come here.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.768
Grab my hand. Grab my hand.

28:13.802 --> 28:15.003
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:15.036 --> 28:17.138
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:17.172 --> 28:21.309
You feel her brea...
Her veins breathing? Huh?

28:21.342 --> 28:23.378
You feel that?

28:24.279 --> 28:26.414
God! It feels so good!

28:27.382 --> 28:29.484
And only I can feel it...

28:30.819 --> 28:33.021
because I got fire

28:33.054 --> 28:35.123
in my heart.

28:37.058 --> 28:39.494
God! It feels so good!

28:39.527 --> 28:41.529
To own it!

28:43.131 --> 28:44.432
Take it in.

28:44.466 --> 28:46.267
Breathe, breathe in.

28:46.301 --> 28:48.303
Take it all in!

28:58.847 --> 29:01.282
Joseph...

29:01.316 --> 29:03.218
how long would you say
we've been here for?

29:03.251 --> 29:05.286
What is this? A test?

29:05.320 --> 29:07.288
I'm just wondering if you knew.

29:07.322 --> 29:09.524
Twenty, thirty minutes.

29:09.557 --> 29:13.461
We sat down at five.
It's now 9:30 at night.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.441
You've only calmed down enough
in the last five minutes

29:17.465 --> 29:20.568
for me to be able
to talk to you.

29:20.602 --> 29:22.937
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I have enough knowledge

29:22.971 --> 29:25.473
to know that you need help.

29:25.507 --> 29:28.476
I think you're trapped
in a severe psychotic state

29:28.510 --> 29:32.447
cycling between melancholia
and mania... and hallucinating.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.150
Why would you s...
Why would you say that?

29:35.183 --> 29:37.218
Because you're doing it
right now.

29:40.155 --> 29:42.323
There's no one there, Joseph!

29:45.426 --> 29:47.829
Jesus Christ.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.867
I'm losing my mind.

29:59.107 --> 30:01.643
You're just lost in your mind.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.845
We have to get you back.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.382
All you need are a couple
of good directions back.

30:07.415 --> 30:10.151
Maybe a... high-powered GPS

30:10.185 --> 30:13.121
with a crazy man
tracking device.

30:13.154 --> 30:15.256
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

30:15.290 --> 30:16.591
Don't be.

30:16.624 --> 30:19.294
I'm glad you came to town
and I met you.

30:19.327 --> 30:21.462
I don't have many friends here.

30:21.496 --> 30:23.998
You thought you'd start
with the nutty guys first.

30:25.633 --> 30:29.070
I guess my daddy complex works
to your advantage in this case.

30:34.409 --> 30:37.245
These are the same pills
that you were on.

30:37.278 --> 30:39.981
It says you are being treated
for bipolar 1?

30:41.282 --> 30:43.051
Yeah.

30:43.084 --> 30:45.186
And its refill
was over a year ago.

30:47.155 --> 30:48.465
Look, this morning
you were apathetic

30:48.489 --> 30:50.425
and tonight you were
hysterically manic.

30:50.458 --> 30:53.027
You won't be able
to control it without these.

30:56.197 --> 30:58.233
Can I see you again?

31:00.134 --> 31:02.203
Take your medicine
and we'll see.

31:09.377 --> 31:11.946
Do you love her?

31:11.980 --> 31:13.915
Don't start.

31:15.283 --> 31:18.219
She's nice,
she wants to help me.

31:18.253 --> 31:20.188
Don't you got
any other friends down there?

31:20.221 --> 31:23.024
Yes. Yes, I do, indeed.

31:23.057 --> 31:25.994
But you're my best friend,
Joseph.

31:26.027 --> 31:28.029
Is that okay?

31:29.030 --> 31:31.532
I want my life again.

31:31.566 --> 31:33.968
I'm suffering her.

31:34.002 --> 31:36.471
I imagine
you'll return to church.

31:36.504 --> 31:39.507
Maybe. Maybe not.
Maybe a lot of things.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.075
Maybe, uh...

31:44.245 --> 31:46.247
Maybe this is good for me.

31:48.650 --> 31:51.519
Sweetie gave me some pills,
I gonna take 'em.

31:51.552 --> 31:53.655
I'm gonna take the pills!

31:53.688 --> 31:58.493
Did I tell you...
I dreamt that I was a bird?

31:58.526 --> 32:01.129
Odd really, when you think about
it because I've never imagined

32:01.162 --> 32:03.631
myself to be another creature...

32:03.665 --> 32:07.702
and yet still,
I could fly very high and wide.

32:07.735 --> 32:09.737
Soar and dive.

32:10.805 --> 32:13.308
It was truly remarkable.

32:13.341 --> 32:16.044
I recall I was following you
through town

32:16.077 --> 32:18.279
on the way to the ocean.

32:18.313 --> 32:21.316
I was gliding above
making sure you were safe

32:21.349 --> 32:23.651
making sure you were happy.

32:23.685 --> 32:25.586
Then all of a sudden

32:25.620 --> 32:27.555
you disappeared
beneath the older trees

32:27.588 --> 32:29.324
and bushes where I could
no longer see you

32:29.357 --> 32:31.592
no longer call to you
or protect you.

32:33.127 --> 32:36.698
I felt helpless...
and started to panic.

32:36.731 --> 32:39.600
So I dropped down
into the heavy foliage.

32:39.634 --> 32:42.503
When I finally broke through...

32:42.537 --> 32:44.772
I was the one walking

32:44.806 --> 32:47.041
and the ocean
was in front of me.

32:47.709 --> 32:49.744
I looked to the sky

32:49.777 --> 32:52.380
and the bird
was now flying above me.

32:54.215 --> 32:57.085
If I have to swim away from you

32:57.118 --> 32:59.153
I will, Joseph

32:59.187 --> 33:01.522
because I know
we will always be friends.

33:03.124 --> 33:05.660
But please,
tell me more about the girl

33:05.693 --> 33:07.729
on the boat before I go.

33:31.619 --> 33:34.489
Ruddi, get out here! Hey, Jack.

33:38.659 --> 33:40.061
Jack.

33:42.363 --> 33:44.098
You're home.

33:44.132 --> 33:45.333
Hey.

33:47.869 --> 33:50.104
Where is she?

33:52.373 --> 33:55.243
I'm gonna take your...
I'll take you to her.

33:56.511 --> 34:00.314
Hey, come on,
get the, get the keys.

34:00.348 --> 34:02.817
Get the keys. Come on.

34:02.850 --> 34:06.187
I'm just gonna get dressed.
You wanna come in and wait?

34:09.524 --> 34:11.159
Get the keys!

34:35.449 --> 34:37.618
- Just come in.
- No.

34:37.652 --> 34:39.630
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- I'm not coming in, please.

34:39.654 --> 34:41.665
Uh, you need to respect my
boundaries while we're in town.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.757
Nothing is going
to happen, Mitch.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.661
Alright. Fine.

34:47.695 --> 34:49.496
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

34:49.530 --> 34:51.565
I'll just go up the street
and get something.

35:04.245 --> 35:05.813
I don't know, Joseph

35:05.847 --> 35:10.618
but... Annabel was my friend.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.889
Okay. Let's start there.

35:16.257 --> 35:18.526
Tell me about her.

35:18.559 --> 35:21.395
Tell me something.

35:21.429 --> 35:23.598
It's kind of hard
to describe her.

35:23.631 --> 35:26.400
'Cause she's not like anyone
you've ever met before.

35:28.002 --> 35:30.347
You know how you meet people in
life and they always remind you

35:30.371 --> 35:33.341
of somebody that you knew or
you met and you're always like

35:33.374 --> 35:36.878
"Oh, you remind me of Scott.
Or you're so much like Terra."

35:40.681 --> 35:43.618
She was the only Annabel Lee
I have ever met.

35:47.488 --> 35:49.690
She smiled a lot.

35:49.724 --> 35:52.493
She sang.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.529
She was a painter.

35:54.562 --> 35:57.231
And she could talk to anybody.

35:57.265 --> 35:59.634
I mean, anybody.
Didn't matter who you were.

36:04.405 --> 36:07.675
And she was so stunningly
beautiful and had no idea.

36:10.778 --> 36:12.847
She was just like this...

36:12.880 --> 36:15.750
nice, beautiful person.

36:17.585 --> 36:19.587
To know her was special.

36:22.990 --> 36:25.226
I miss her.

36:26.761 --> 36:28.763
Are you okay?

36:29.964 --> 36:31.933
I'm sorry. I think I messed up.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.903
It's fine. It's fine.

36:35.937 --> 36:38.506
Anne...

36:38.539 --> 36:40.708
who's the witness to all this?

36:44.011 --> 36:45.479
Excuse me for a second.

36:45.513 --> 36:47.882
Anne? Anne? Anne.

36:51.652 --> 36:53.921
You've been in town
for over a week.

36:53.955 --> 36:56.023
What are you up to, city boy?

36:56.891 --> 36:58.292
Hmm.

36:59.994 --> 37:01.662
Those are private.

37:01.696 --> 37:04.599
Dusty, those are private.
Give them back.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.368
Dusty.

37:07.401 --> 37:09.904
You're here doing a story
on my family?

37:09.937 --> 37:12.540
There are many people
outside of Bodega

37:12.573 --> 37:14.542
in the greater community
that wish to know

37:14.575 --> 37:17.445
the details of this story.

37:17.478 --> 37:19.947
There's a lot more to this
than you know.

37:19.981 --> 37:22.550
And talking to some naive
school teacher who doesn't know

37:22.583 --> 37:25.686
the half of it,
that's dirty in my eyes.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.922
Probably in my husbands, too.

37:27.955 --> 37:30.758
Not to mention
how Jack would feel about it.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.793
That's a whole other thing.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.963
Well, that sounds threatening.

37:37.398 --> 37:39.066
No.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.602
I'm not gonna say anything.

37:41.636 --> 37:43.347
You think I wanna pay
to get Ruddi out of jail

37:43.371 --> 37:46.540
for what he'd do to you?

37:46.574 --> 37:48.118
I just can't promise
that Deedee is gonna

37:48.142 --> 37:50.945
keep her mouth shut.

37:50.978 --> 37:53.547
Okay, Dusty, I'll play along.

37:53.581 --> 37:55.349
Who's Deedee?

37:55.383 --> 37:56.817
She's my other personality.

37:56.851 --> 37:58.686
She comes out when I drink

37:58.719 --> 38:00.821
and she can be
quite a troublemaker.

38:00.855 --> 38:03.133
And she might think your actions
here are a little disrespectful

38:03.157 --> 38:05.359
to her family.

38:06.394 --> 38:08.529
Oh, don't get so worried.

38:08.562 --> 38:10.398
I'm not drinking until tonight.

38:10.431 --> 38:12.099
You still have
a couple of hours.

38:12.133 --> 38:14.368
Am I making sense, Mr. Hale?

38:16.771 --> 38:19.106
Yes. Got it.

38:19.140 --> 38:22.743
Dusty, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting later.

38:22.777 --> 38:26.914
We are. I just popped in to help
this man get his facts straight.

38:31.485 --> 38:32.653
Ready?

38:37.858 --> 38:39.627
- Happy birthday, Dusty Lee.
- Thanks.

38:39.660 --> 38:41.429
Have a safe trip back.

38:41.462 --> 38:43.564
Trying to fuck over
the whole family?

39:06.120 --> 39:07.922
Hey, Sweetie.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.091
Hi.

39:25.573 --> 39:26.707
Do you like my flowers?

39:26.741 --> 39:27.875
Thank you.

39:53.868 --> 39:55.202
Oops.

39:55.236 --> 39:57.505
Forgot the blanket.

40:13.821 --> 40:15.823
She's just up here a ways.

40:18.092 --> 40:19.794
Had 'em, uh

40:19.827 --> 40:22.530
put her off to the side
just so...

40:22.563 --> 40:24.865
You know, away from the other
stones, like you said.

40:26.967 --> 40:30.171
She, uh, she looked good
in mom's dress, you know.

40:35.676 --> 40:37.678
- She looked, uh...
- Ruddi.

40:37.711 --> 40:38.913
She...

40:40.080 --> 40:42.082
Go home.

40:46.754 --> 40:49.089
Hey, how-how are you gonna...

40:49.123 --> 40:51.559
how are you gonna get back then?

41:13.581 --> 41:15.850
These are lovely. Thank you.

41:15.883 --> 41:18.319
The white's supposed to mean
reverence and humility

41:18.352 --> 41:20.921
which I thought was fitting.

41:20.955 --> 41:25.259
Uh, thank you
for listening to me

41:25.292 --> 41:29.196
and... you know, helping me
with my medicine.

41:30.130 --> 41:32.933
How do you feel?

41:32.967 --> 41:35.936
Was pretty clouded the first
three or four days, then it just

41:35.970 --> 41:38.539
you know, got a little
less desperate.

41:40.641 --> 41:42.276
Go on.

41:42.309 --> 41:44.144
My head's cleared now, you know.

41:44.178 --> 41:47.581
I'm not all over the place
with the thoughts.

41:47.615 --> 41:49.917
What was the second pill
that you, you gave me for...

41:49.950 --> 41:52.119
It was a...

41:52.152 --> 41:54.889
It's an anti-psychotic medicine.

41:54.922 --> 41:57.191
Used to treat the manic episode
you were having

41:57.224 --> 41:59.860
but now that it's settled down

41:59.894 --> 42:01.795
all you need
is some mood stabilizer.

42:01.829 --> 42:03.006
How do you know all this shit?

42:03.030 --> 42:05.933
Oh... one, I'm a doctor

42:05.966 --> 42:08.168
and two, I care to know.

42:13.407 --> 42:15.676
Who is Annabel?

42:19.880 --> 42:20.915
Annabel...

42:23.984 --> 42:24.985
was my wife.

42:25.019 --> 42:27.721
She... died...

42:29.957 --> 42:32.059
in an accident in the water.

42:35.863 --> 42:37.965
I'm so sorry.

42:39.366 --> 42:41.135
What happened?

42:45.105 --> 42:47.174
It was a storm...

42:48.242 --> 42:51.378
and her boat tipped over.

42:51.412 --> 42:55.282
She... By the time
they found her, she'd drowned.

42:55.316 --> 42:57.718
There was nothing more
they could have done.

43:00.321 --> 43:03.157
That's why you
went off your medicine

43:03.190 --> 43:05.192
didn't leave the house.

43:05.225 --> 43:07.928
'Cause you were depressed
because you loved her.

43:08.696 --> 43:09.897
Yeah.

43:12.366 --> 43:13.901
Sorry.

43:14.702 --> 43:16.136
What's that?

43:17.137 --> 43:18.839
That?

43:22.476 --> 43:25.045
That's a combination of my ex

43:25.079 --> 43:28.248
birth control pills and two
really good bottles of wine.

43:28.282 --> 43:31.819
From my perspective, all three
of those sound pretty good.

43:33.487 --> 43:36.190
Yeah, at the time
they sounded good to me too.

43:38.058 --> 43:39.893
He was abusive?

43:42.029 --> 43:44.431
No. No.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.402
I was.

43:50.204 --> 43:52.072
I was a nightmare.

43:52.106 --> 43:54.241
I was a completely
different person.

43:57.811 --> 44:01.181
He, he was a really good guy
that was just trying to help me

44:01.215 --> 44:03.917
until it all just...

44:03.951 --> 44:05.953
basically imploded.

44:06.987 --> 44:09.723
So that's when you moved here?

44:09.757 --> 44:12.359
So you can be good for a change?

44:12.393 --> 44:15.729
Take a break from,
uh, torturing men

44:15.763 --> 44:17.064
drinking like a pirate.

44:21.268 --> 44:23.504
So, family?

44:23.537 --> 44:26.940
Brothers, sisters, mom, dad?

44:26.974 --> 44:30.044
- Only child.
- Really?

44:30.077 --> 44:32.813
Wow. You're so good
with women, Joe.

44:32.846 --> 44:34.848
I would have thought
you had sisters.

44:34.882 --> 44:35.883
Nah, no sisters.

44:35.916 --> 44:37.217
My mother left when I was six

44:37.251 --> 44:39.520
and my father brought me up
after that.

44:39.553 --> 44:42.256
Oh. That must have been hard.

44:44.391 --> 44:46.493
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

44:47.861 --> 44:49.863
Well, do you remember her?

44:49.897 --> 44:51.098
Uh, some stuff.

44:51.131 --> 44:53.367
She was... nice

44:53.400 --> 44:55.302
very affectionate,
very protective

44:55.335 --> 44:58.038
that kind of thing.

44:58.072 --> 45:00.074
And your dad?

45:01.141 --> 45:03.844
He was a...

45:03.877 --> 45:06.346
He was a diary farmer
at a pasture in this town.

45:08.248 --> 45:10.250
Is he still alive?

45:10.284 --> 45:12.519
I don't know.

45:12.553 --> 45:14.755
That's the reason
my mother left.

45:15.956 --> 45:17.458
Would you like me to tell you...

45:17.491 --> 45:20.260
why my mother left?

45:22.896 --> 45:25.199
No. It's fine.

45:25.232 --> 45:27.267
Screw you.

45:29.002 --> 45:32.039
Uh... Anyway, this is me.

45:33.273 --> 45:37.911
- Um, this your house?
- Mm-hmm.

45:37.945 --> 45:39.513
I used to go
to Sunday school here.

45:39.546 --> 45:41.415
- Really?
- No, really.

45:41.448 --> 45:43.117
You do... You-you live here?

45:43.150 --> 45:45.252
Yeah, I'm renting the top floor.

45:47.554 --> 45:49.857
Do you wanna come in and see it?

45:54.428 --> 45:57.331
Stop.

45:59.566 --> 46:02.102
Tell me that you love me...

46:02.136 --> 46:03.170
I can't...

46:05.305 --> 46:08.609
I can't play right now.
I gotta rest some.

46:08.642 --> 46:11.145
It's not play, Joe.

46:11.178 --> 46:13.514
Oh.

46:13.547 --> 46:15.916
Forget it.

46:18.118 --> 46:20.020
Really?

46:20.053 --> 46:21.188
Never mind.

46:21.221 --> 46:23.557
- No, listen.
- Stop.

46:23.590 --> 46:25.159
Annabel...

46:27.361 --> 46:29.930
I've never loved anyone more.

46:31.665 --> 46:36.103
I can't imagine livin' a life
without you in it.

46:36.937 --> 46:38.972
You know that.

46:41.408 --> 46:43.043
What if I die before you?

46:43.076 --> 46:45.045
See, that's why I don't like
talking about this.

46:45.078 --> 46:47.080
Would you love again?

46:48.348 --> 46:50.450
Would you trick your heart
so easily?

46:53.620 --> 46:56.023
You are my heart...

46:56.657 --> 46:58.892
and my love.

47:11.004 --> 47:13.140
You ate all my cherry waffles.

47:13.173 --> 47:16.543
It's all the medicine that you
gave me. It's not my fault.

47:16.577 --> 47:18.612
Last night was fun, Joe.

47:20.581 --> 47:22.649
Yeah, it was.

47:25.252 --> 47:26.587
So...

47:28.088 --> 47:29.923
what's next?

47:33.527 --> 47:35.028
You tell me.

47:35.062 --> 47:36.439
We were just here.
We got kicked out.

47:36.463 --> 47:39.366
- I can't fucking deal with her.
- Go in.

47:39.399 --> 47:41.377
You go see if they're in here.
Why do I always have to...

47:41.401 --> 47:43.337
Just do what I fuckin' say!

47:43.370 --> 47:45.405
- What's this about?
- Don't fucking touch me.

47:45.439 --> 47:47.016
Do not fucking touch me.
I'm not kidding.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.184
I don't know,
but it can't be good.

47:48.208 --> 47:49.476
Now, you two, listen to me.

47:49.509 --> 47:51.311
No one here wants
any trouble with you

47:51.345 --> 47:53.680
so just turn around and go
right back where you came from.

47:53.714 --> 47:55.282
It has nothing to do with you...

47:55.315 --> 47:57.150
I will break you in half
if you will ever

47:57.184 --> 47:58.185
speak that way...

47:59.720 --> 48:01.688
You stay the fuck out of it!

48:01.722 --> 48:03.690
- Get off of me.
- This is about our family!

48:03.724 --> 48:07.127
Oh, no. Not in my bar.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.062
I'm going to get my husband
and the sheriff...

48:09.096 --> 48:11.207
- Go get anyone you want, woman!
- Yeah, you go get 'em, bitch!

48:11.231 --> 48:13.300
- Them.
- Get the fuck out.

48:13.333 --> 48:15.102
Get the fuck out! Go!

48:15.135 --> 48:17.170
Go! Get the fuck out!

48:17.204 --> 48:20.607
Hey! I'm Jack.

48:22.509 --> 48:24.278
Shake it.

48:26.213 --> 48:27.981
I said, shake it!

48:34.688 --> 48:36.290
Good.

48:37.724 --> 48:40.294
This man tell you who I am?

48:40.327 --> 48:43.664
Better yet, better yet.
Did this man tell you who he is?

48:46.500 --> 48:49.670
Me? I'm his wife's brother.

48:49.703 --> 48:51.705
His family.

48:51.738 --> 48:54.174
A troubled convict.

48:54.207 --> 48:57.377
Him? He's a coward.

48:58.412 --> 49:02.115
He's a liar. And he's a thief.

49:02.149 --> 49:05.585
- Jack...
- Don't say a word!

49:05.619 --> 49:07.354
What are you talking about?

49:07.387 --> 49:10.324
Your new boyfriend is a bad guy.

49:10.357 --> 49:12.592
He's a killer, doc.

49:12.626 --> 49:14.161
Oh, yeah.

49:15.295 --> 49:17.297
Oh, you didn't tell her, Joe?

49:19.800 --> 49:21.702
This man...

49:21.735 --> 49:24.338
if you can call him that much

49:24.371 --> 49:28.475
took our baby sister
out on a boat ride.

49:28.508 --> 49:30.744
And when they came back,
guess what?

49:32.512 --> 49:34.781
She wasn't with him.

49:34.815 --> 49:37.451
What was it, Rude? A, uh...

49:37.484 --> 49:40.320
There was an angler
off a darn beach

49:40.354 --> 49:42.689
had to fish her out.

49:42.723 --> 49:44.424
Yeah.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.526
He took from us.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.562
From my family.

49:48.595 --> 49:51.465
A daughter and a sister.

49:51.498 --> 49:53.433
You were on that boat, Joseph?

49:55.202 --> 49:56.579
- Is that the truth?
- Of course it is.

49:56.603 --> 49:58.772
- I just said it.
- I wasn't on the boat with her.

49:58.805 --> 50:01.575
No. You fuckin' lie about it...

50:04.244 --> 50:06.813
and I'll cut you in half...

50:06.847 --> 50:09.316
right now.

50:09.349 --> 50:12.152
Joseph, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. What was it again?

50:12.185 --> 50:14.788
Was it a, was it a,
a blue whale?

50:14.821 --> 50:17.824
Oh, no, no, a humpback, huh?

50:17.858 --> 50:19.359
In the spring, right?

50:19.393 --> 50:20.837
- The humpback whale.
- The humpback whale.

50:20.861 --> 50:23.397
It was a g... The gray whale.

50:23.430 --> 50:24.731
Yeah, the gray whale.

50:26.733 --> 50:29.236
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

50:29.269 --> 50:33.540
No citation, migratin'
in spring, you fuckin' fool.

50:33.573 --> 50:35.409
They're lying,
I didn't, I-I didn't

50:35.442 --> 50:36.676
do anything wrong, come on.

50:36.710 --> 50:37.878
No, w-wait, ask him.

50:37.911 --> 50:39.679
Ask him how he makes a living?

50:39.713 --> 50:41.415
You ask him.

50:41.448 --> 50:45.118
Ask him about our sister's
life insurance policy.

50:45.152 --> 50:47.387
Tell her,
you fuckin' bottom-feeder.

50:48.255 --> 50:50.157
Oh.

50:52.325 --> 50:54.628
Can I borrow something to draw?

50:54.661 --> 50:56.163
Just me.

50:57.631 --> 51:00.767
What him? Ruddi, Dane.

51:02.269 --> 51:05.505
You touch him,
and I'll kill you both.

51:05.539 --> 51:07.240
- No, Ruddi.
- Fuck.

51:08.542 --> 51:11.144
- Alright, that's enough.
- That'll do, Jack.

51:11.178 --> 51:12.612
You're gonna arrest me, Bill?

51:12.646 --> 51:14.848
Like I have a dozen times
before, son.

51:16.683 --> 51:19.386
Dane, get the hell out of here
before I kick your dumb ass.

51:21.488 --> 51:23.123
Miss, you go home too.

51:26.193 --> 51:30.330
I'm gonna bleed you out. Yeah?

51:31.565 --> 51:33.633
I'm gonna bleed you out.

51:37.704 --> 51:40.740
Oh, look at that.

51:40.774 --> 51:43.443
Big Tom Mulkheney, huh?

51:44.744 --> 51:47.380
I'm, I'm not little Lee anymore.

51:48.915 --> 51:51.785
And you're not as scary
as you used to be, old man.

51:54.454 --> 51:58.258
We, uh, gonna have to work
some things out.

51:59.826 --> 52:01.895
- That's enough, Jack.
- This suits me just fine.

52:01.928 --> 52:05.232
That's enough, guys. Alright,
Jack get out of here, come on.

52:23.250 --> 52:25.252
Oh. Hi.

52:27.454 --> 52:30.257
Really, Dusty?
Was that necessary?

52:30.290 --> 52:33.326
I told you this asshole's
doing a story on our family.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.996
Trying to make Hawthorne
look innocent.

52:36.029 --> 52:39.799
Dammit, Mitch.
Would you grab the index cards?

52:46.473 --> 52:48.708
You know,
I'd really like to speak

52:48.742 --> 52:50.477
with you guys
if you have a moment.

52:53.813 --> 52:55.482
Jesus.

52:58.818 --> 53:01.755
- Fuck!
- Let me explain. Can you stop?

53:01.788 --> 53:04.324
Listen. I was afraid
that you would judge me.

53:04.357 --> 53:06.026
Judge you?

53:06.059 --> 53:07.661
Judge you for what?

53:07.694 --> 53:08.838
You didn't do
anything wrong, right?

53:08.862 --> 53:10.330
That's why I didn't tell you

53:10.363 --> 53:11.574
because of the way
you're acting right now.

53:11.598 --> 53:12.608
Why didn't you defend yourself

53:12.632 --> 53:14.034
in there, Joseph?

53:14.067 --> 53:16.870
Why? Why didn't you say anything
back to those men?

53:16.903 --> 53:19.039
You don't understand.

53:19.072 --> 53:21.942
Well, you're innocent, right?

53:21.975 --> 53:24.811
Why didn't you tell them that?

53:24.844 --> 53:27.280
Why did you let that guy
talk all that crazy shit

53:27.314 --> 53:29.482
if it wasn't true?

53:29.516 --> 53:32.919
Why? Why did you lie to me?

53:34.354 --> 53:35.855
So you could fuck me?

53:37.757 --> 53:39.793
I was just easy for you, huh?

53:39.826 --> 53:40.894
No!

53:42.529 --> 53:44.864
I was the only one in town
who didn't know.

53:46.633 --> 53:48.535
And I'm walking around
with you, with you

53:48.568 --> 53:50.337
with God knows who!

53:50.370 --> 53:51.805
Just let me explain, okay.

53:51.838 --> 53:53.039
Did you do it?

53:57.877 --> 53:59.446
Did you, Joseph?

54:01.348 --> 54:02.682
Did you kill your wife?

54:05.652 --> 54:07.520
Answer me!

54:09.756 --> 54:11.391
Well, that's just as reassuring

54:11.424 --> 54:13.893
as the last 24 hours
have been, thank you.

54:13.927 --> 54:15.829
What are those pills
doing in your bathroom?

54:17.397 --> 54:20.100
Is your, what-what
is your life off limits?

54:20.133 --> 54:24.070
I mean, since we're being honest
with each other here.

54:24.104 --> 54:27.841
I was fired from my last job
in Ashlyn, where I told my boss

54:27.874 --> 54:29.776
that I thought
that I was God's mother

54:29.809 --> 54:33.513
and the pills I was distributing
were messages for my children.

54:36.783 --> 54:39.452
I'm bipolar too, Joseph.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.555
That's why I thought
I could help you.

54:44.024 --> 54:46.826
Because I know when a man
is in despair

54:46.860 --> 54:49.696
and how-how fast
and hard it can spiral

54:49.729 --> 54:51.931
until you feel like
you're lookin' out of a cave.

54:54.734 --> 54:55.902
Now, that's the truth.

54:57.804 --> 55:01.474
You tell me the truth.
You tell me.

55:04.411 --> 55:08.048
What really happened,
to your beautiful Annabel Lee?

55:19.993 --> 55:22.028
I don't know.

55:33.740 --> 55:35.975
Unbelievable!

55:36.009 --> 55:37.777
I'm sorry about that, Jack,
the guy, he just

55:37.811 --> 55:40.547
he slipped between
the cracks, you know.

55:40.580 --> 55:41.757
People at the rental office,
they said

55:41.781 --> 55:43.125
that he was here
doin' a different story.

55:43.149 --> 55:44.551
I mean, uh, figured him

55:44.584 --> 55:46.686
to be an honest guy, you know.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.455
Can't trust anybody these days.

55:51.524 --> 55:52.625
Right?

55:54.761 --> 55:56.539
You saw me, though, right.
I told him that he-he can't.

55:56.563 --> 55:58.965
He's gotta go, I mean,
he can't stay with me, he knows.

55:58.998 --> 56:01.468
No, sir. Not if, not if
he's gonna do that story.

56:03.503 --> 56:06.940
You know, as soon as I found
out it's you and me, it was
it was over, you know, uh, no

56:06.973 --> 56:10.577
no hesitation... whatsoever.

56:13.847 --> 56:16.583
You know, I could really
use the money too. I was
charged top dollar

56:16.616 --> 56:18.176
for that room upstairs,
you know, you...

56:21.855 --> 56:24.691
Jack! Hey, Jack! Wait...

56:26.626 --> 56:29.195
Hey, I can, I can come by later,
you know. We can...

56:29.229 --> 56:30.697
I can crack a beer, you know.

56:30.730 --> 56:31.941
Let's straighten
this whole thing out

56:31.965 --> 56:33.600
you know?

56:33.633 --> 56:36.035
If that's, uh, if that's better.

57:10.937 --> 57:13.506
She would have walked.

57:13.540 --> 57:16.576
And I never would've seen
her again, you know that.

57:16.609 --> 57:19.012
More than anyone, you know that.

57:20.980 --> 57:23.116
What was I supposed to say?

57:23.149 --> 57:25.051
Hi, I'm Joseph.

57:25.084 --> 57:27.720
I think my wife died,
but I don't exactly remember.

57:27.754 --> 57:30.523
Can you fill my order,
and sleep with me?

57:33.259 --> 57:35.829
It's not funny? No?

57:35.862 --> 57:38.097
You got nothin' to say?
No clear analogies?

57:38.131 --> 57:40.066
No profound dream for me?

57:42.268 --> 57:43.770
Talk to me.

57:47.173 --> 57:49.776
I tried to have a life.

57:49.809 --> 57:52.846
You want your chop,
because I put my health in...

57:54.914 --> 57:56.549
in front of you?

57:57.750 --> 57:59.519
Because I needed better?

58:02.355 --> 58:04.691
Are you so jealous...

58:05.892 --> 58:09.562
that you would ignore...
a friend...

58:09.596 --> 58:10.797
when he's like this?

58:12.999 --> 58:15.268
I don't need you.

58:15.301 --> 58:16.970
I protected you.

58:20.306 --> 58:23.009
You're the killer.

58:23.042 --> 58:26.813
You sprang up from the ocean
and took her from me.

58:26.846 --> 58:28.915
You tipped the fuckin' boat.

58:30.884 --> 58:32.585
Why am I being punished?

58:34.921 --> 58:37.090
Whale!

58:37.123 --> 58:39.792
I didn't mean it.

58:39.826 --> 58:43.196
I didn't mean it.
Please, don't leave.

58:43.229 --> 58:46.065
Whale! Don't leave me.

58:47.400 --> 58:48.601
Come back!

58:48.635 --> 58:51.638
♪♪

01:01:58.357 --> 01:02:00.359
I'm here.

01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:03.396
♪♪

01:02:17.143 --> 01:02:19.245
There's no givin' that one.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:21.280
Caught me
at the grocery yesterday.

01:02:21.314 --> 01:02:24.117
Asked me about a 1,000
questions. Relentless.

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.551
Yeah, well, if he's not careful

01:02:25.585 --> 01:02:27.386
he's gonna get a lot more
than a story.

01:02:29.355 --> 01:02:31.224
Nice enough fella though.

01:02:31.257 --> 01:02:32.492
It's Tom, right?

01:02:32.525 --> 01:02:34.093
That's my name.

01:02:34.127 --> 01:02:37.096
I'm Sweetie.
I work at the pharmacy.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.866
That's where I met Joseph.

01:02:39.899 --> 01:02:40.933
Okay.

01:02:42.902 --> 01:02:45.037
I just, I wanted to say hello...

01:02:45.071 --> 01:02:47.406
You wanna know if he did it.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.243
If I didn't care about him,
I wouldn't...

01:02:50.276 --> 01:02:52.478
but I do.

01:02:52.512 --> 01:02:54.347
I'm worried about him
up in that house.

01:02:56.415 --> 01:02:59.152
Look, I don't know
what happened that day

01:02:59.185 --> 01:03:02.088
you know, to his wife.
I wasn't there.

01:03:02.121 --> 01:03:03.856
Somebody was, I mean...

01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:06.359
I mean, like I said,
it's, it's just...

01:03:06.392 --> 01:03:08.027
it's just a big mess now.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:11.330
Is he dangerous, Tom?

01:03:11.364 --> 01:03:13.866
Look, every man's dangerous.
Every man.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.368
I don't think
Joseph's any exception.

01:03:16.602 --> 01:03:17.904
Do you think he did it?

01:03:19.305 --> 01:03:21.507
I think he's sick.

01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:23.342
I don't know that he's bad.

01:03:25.211 --> 01:03:27.313
What about that bald guy?

01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:29.549
The one with the scars
and the tattoos.

01:03:29.582 --> 01:03:30.659
Why is he bothering Joseph...

01:03:30.683 --> 01:03:33.352
Yeah, well, he's bad.

01:03:33.386 --> 01:03:35.888
Yeah, he just did a stretch
for manslaughter.

01:03:35.922 --> 01:03:38.591
He's been away
for the last ten years.

01:03:38.624 --> 01:03:41.294
You know, all these
are family problems, miss.

01:03:41.327 --> 01:03:42.361
These are local issues.

01:03:42.395 --> 01:03:43.405
You shouldn't get yourself

01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:44.997
involved in this.

01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.233
So nobody should get involved?

01:03:47.266 --> 01:03:49.135
Just wait around
while they kill him?

01:03:49.168 --> 01:03:50.570
Look, I can't.

01:03:50.603 --> 01:03:53.472
I can't get mixed up
with this bunch.

01:03:53.506 --> 01:03:56.042
You know, I've already
put myself out there.

01:03:56.075 --> 01:03:58.110
- But you said...
- But I said, that I like him.

01:03:58.144 --> 01:04:00.146
I would do anything
I can for him.

01:04:00.179 --> 01:04:02.481
And I would, but...

01:04:05.284 --> 01:04:07.587
Look, everybody
has a past in this town.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.122
You know, I have a wife now.

01:04:10.156 --> 01:04:12.391
I have a business,
I have responsibilities.

01:04:14.126 --> 01:04:15.228
You understand that?

01:04:17.663 --> 01:04:19.999
- I understand.
- Okay.

01:04:20.032 --> 01:04:22.535
You take care of yourself then.

01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:23.603
You too.

01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:45.691
- Hey, man.
- What the...

01:04:49.362 --> 01:04:52.265
Little bit more.

01:04:52.298 --> 01:04:53.778
Just give me,
give me that damn thing.

01:04:55.701 --> 01:04:58.237
Jesus, where the hell...

01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:00.406
Where the hell have you
been staying, anyway?

01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:02.241
I've a home over
at the Ruby's Slipper.

01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:05.311
It's fine. What?

01:05:05.344 --> 01:05:07.013
It's nothing,
I'm-I'm just, I'm...

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:09.248
I'm certain that's probably
the worst motel in town.

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:13.986
Check it, you got bed bugs,
you got mold, you got filth.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.621
The guys won't even
take hookers there.

01:05:19.225 --> 01:05:21.594
Talk about story, huh?

01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:23.338
I was always wondering
why it was so expensive

01:05:23.362 --> 01:05:24.397
for such a shit hole.

01:05:27.433 --> 01:05:30.436
Hey, I'm, uh... I'm sorry,
I kicked you out, buddy.

01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:32.672
I just, uh...
Believe me, I had good reason.

01:05:33.773 --> 01:05:36.208
I understand.

01:05:36.242 --> 01:05:37.343
I wanted the story.

01:05:39.211 --> 01:05:42.481
And I wasn't very considerate
of your life here in town.

01:05:42.515 --> 01:05:46.152
It's my fault, I... I just...

01:05:46.185 --> 01:05:47.653
She's my cousin, Ed.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.090
Oh!

01:05:53.192 --> 01:05:56.062
Why, why would you not
share that with me, Mitch?

01:05:56.095 --> 01:05:58.364
I... You still don't get it,
do you?

01:05:58.397 --> 01:05:59.665
No, I don't, I don't get it.

01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:01.400
Hey, right or wrong

01:06:01.434 --> 01:06:03.636
I can't be seen helpin' you,
because in their eyes

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:05.638
it makes me a fuckin' traitor.

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:07.082
Just so happens,
I have a family that

01:06:07.106 --> 01:06:08.346
believes in capital punishment.

01:06:08.374 --> 01:06:10.643
That's why I got this guy.

01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:15.147
And... I'm just not quite
ready to give up the ghost.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:20.519
This town is so ass backwards.

01:06:20.553 --> 01:06:22.188
These people are your cousins.

01:06:22.221 --> 01:06:24.090
Are they not?

01:06:24.123 --> 01:06:26.092
Your baby sister went out
to sea with her husband

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:27.827
and never came back.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.229
Four hours later,
Joseph steers their family boat

01:06:30.262 --> 01:06:31.497
into a rock at Lawman's Bluff.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:32.598
I know the story

01:06:32.631 --> 01:06:34.100
He comes back bruised and bloody

01:06:34.133 --> 01:06:36.402
with a story about this colossal

01:06:36.435 --> 01:06:38.137
pod of migrants that

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.715
crossed their path
and tipped their boat

01:06:39.739 --> 01:06:42.241
knocked him out
and Annabel over the side.

01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:46.078
They don't see past
shit like that.

01:06:46.112 --> 01:06:50.116
They don't understand
freak accidents, fate, destiny.

01:06:50.149 --> 01:06:53.853
These are not understood
or accepted concepts here, Ed.

01:06:53.886 --> 01:06:55.087
Specially not with the Lee's.

01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:56.264
But for them not to believe...

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:57.690
It-it-it doesn't matter.

01:06:57.723 --> 01:07:00.559
Their own family
could tell them the truth.

01:07:00.593 --> 01:07:02.528
It doesn't matter.

01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:05.564
He came back... she didn't.

01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:08.567
And now we've interfered
and we're...

01:07:08.601 --> 01:07:11.337
we're all fucked.

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.640
- What an austere place.
- Tell me about it.

01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:20.446
Well... all there is left
to do is drink then, huh?

01:07:20.479 --> 01:07:22.481
Yeah.

01:07:22.515 --> 01:07:24.517
Now you're startin'
to get it, penman.

01:07:45.438 --> 01:07:48.441
Mr. Hale, Mr. Hale, come here.

01:07:48.474 --> 01:07:51.811
- Anne?
- Yeah, come here.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:55.414
- Mitch...
- Shh!

01:07:55.448 --> 01:07:57.316
Don't bother with him right now.
Come here.

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:58.584
I have something for you.

01:08:05.558 --> 01:08:08.894
Anne, am I dreaming?
What's goin' on?

01:08:08.928 --> 01:08:11.397
Do you still wanna meet the
witness to the Hawthorne murder?

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:12.865
Yes.

01:08:12.898 --> 01:08:14.476
I can't bring them here
because they don't want

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.602
anyone knowing who they are.

01:08:16.635 --> 01:08:19.638
Oh, especially,
a family member of the Lees.

01:08:21.273 --> 01:08:23.642
I took a big risk
by coming here.

01:08:23.676 --> 01:08:26.345
- Alright.
- Dane would kill me.

01:08:26.377 --> 01:08:28.546
- Do you wanna come with me?
- Yes.

01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:30.616
- Come on, we've to go now.
- Let's get Mitch.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:32.885
No, just you. Come on.

01:08:38.591 --> 01:08:39.758
Sshh.

01:08:47.265 --> 01:08:49.401
Come on, Mr. Hale.
It's just up here.

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:55.341
Anne, why did you say
it's a murder?

01:08:55.374 --> 01:08:57.343
What else would you call it?

01:08:58.711 --> 01:09:01.247
Actually...

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.915
And hello, Dusty.

01:09:06.652 --> 01:09:07.953
I'd call it an accident.

01:09:08.821 --> 01:09:10.589
An undesired event.

01:09:10.622 --> 01:09:12.992
Misfortune.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.560
I'd call this misfortune.

01:09:15.594 --> 01:09:17.796
Dusty, what are they doing here?

01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:19.298
Where's the witness?

01:09:19.331 --> 01:09:21.500
Shut up, Anne.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:22.968
Shut and get-get
the fuck over here.

Oh...

01:10:29.835 --> 01:10:31.937
It's cold now!

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.443
I can smell the poison on you.

01:10:39.612 --> 01:10:43.415
You feelin' no pain.

01:10:43.449 --> 01:10:45.451
That's good.

01:10:46.652 --> 01:10:48.654
That's real good.

01:10:51.857 --> 01:10:55.628
Joe... help me!

God, please, no.

01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:05.037
I'm so cold.

01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:42.708
- Joe.
- No.

01:11:42.741 --> 01:11:45.411
No, don't get near me.

01:11:46.912 --> 01:11:48.947
Jack's coming for you.

01:11:51.817 --> 01:11:53.819
He's gonna get you.

01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:58.757
You said you loved me.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:02.027
You let me
be like this, I'm cold.

01:12:02.061 --> 01:12:04.129
You said that you loved me.

01:12:07.132 --> 01:12:08.567
God...

01:12:10.536 --> 01:12:13.872
When I was 17, I went inside
for the first time.

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:18.577
I thought I was invincible.

01:12:20.079 --> 01:12:23.849
I thought I had to prove
that I wasn't a punk.

01:12:23.882 --> 01:12:27.119
So, I got to running my mouth.

01:12:27.152 --> 01:12:31.090
In a place
I really didn't understand.

01:12:33.492 --> 01:12:35.894
Wasn't long before
I caught a beef

01:12:35.928 --> 01:12:38.030
with one of the other prisoners.

01:12:38.063 --> 01:12:41.600
He, uh, wanted me to mule
or somethin' for him.

01:12:41.633 --> 01:12:43.702
I don't know.

01:12:43.736 --> 01:12:46.138
I told him that
I'd kill his family

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:49.041
if he ever spoke to me again.

01:12:52.811 --> 01:12:54.079
Few days later

01:12:54.113 --> 01:12:57.616
about five of them
caught me off guard.

01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:59.952
Beat me into a coma.

01:12:59.985 --> 01:13:02.121
Clipped off my tongue
with a dirty shiv

01:13:02.154 --> 01:13:04.656
and gave me this.

01:13:07.559 --> 01:13:09.595
That was my punishment

01:13:09.628 --> 01:13:11.597
for disrespecting

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:14.533
them in their house.

01:13:20.739 --> 01:13:23.108
Annabel...

01:13:25.511 --> 01:13:27.880
was the only one
who came to save me...

01:13:27.913 --> 01:13:30.783
when I was hurt.

01:13:30.816 --> 01:13:33.018
She said...

01:13:33.051 --> 01:13:35.087
all this agony...

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.955
was just...

01:13:36.989 --> 01:13:40.692
was just temporary.

01:13:40.726 --> 01:13:43.796
"Don't let the pain
get in front of you.

01:13:45.164 --> 01:13:48.167
No matter
how bad it gets, Jackie."

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.672
Okay, he says.

01:13:53.705 --> 01:13:55.507
Okay.

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.180
A few years later,
I caught the same guy and...

01:14:02.848 --> 01:14:05.284
I cut him open from his ear down

01:14:05.317 --> 01:14:07.886
to his ankle with a can opener.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.757
It was his time
to learn a lesson.

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:13.559
So that was that.

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:20.232
Don't do this.

01:14:22.935 --> 01:14:24.636
Don't do this.
You're accountable.

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:26.271
You're all accountable,
you hear me?

01:14:26.305 --> 01:14:28.841
You're all fucking accountable!

01:14:28.874 --> 01:14:33.145
Don't let the pain
get in front of you.

01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:35.714
Please... please.

01:14:35.747 --> 01:14:37.716
Now...

01:14:37.749 --> 01:14:39.885
which hand do you write with?

01:14:39.918 --> 01:14:42.588
What?

01:14:42.621 --> 01:14:44.790
I said...

01:14:44.823 --> 01:14:48.227
which hand do you write with?

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.995
My left.

01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:51.763
- That one?
- Yes.

01:14:51.797 --> 01:14:52.898
Oh.

01:15:06.979 --> 01:15:09.248
Wait.

01:15:09.281 --> 01:15:12.150
Don't hurt more, please.

01:15:12.985 --> 01:15:15.220
What? What?

01:15:19.057 --> 01:15:21.093
- Where's my shiv?
- Right there!

01:15:26.999 --> 01:15:29.201
No. Please.

01:15:29.234 --> 01:15:31.136
Please, please,
don't do that, don't...

01:15:36.909 --> 01:15:39.111
Help me!

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:45.651
What?

01:15:45.684 --> 01:15:47.286
What, little brother?

01:15:47.319 --> 01:15:48.854
Too much?

01:15:58.797 --> 01:16:01.066
I bet it was a dream.

01:16:01.099 --> 01:16:02.734
And those...

01:16:02.768 --> 01:16:05.737
are dreamed by night...

01:16:05.771 --> 01:16:08.173
or awake.

01:16:08.206 --> 01:16:10.976
I was dreaming I think.

01:16:11.009 --> 01:16:14.079
Or cognizant of many things.

01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:17.015
We should skip those.
Only dream.

01:16:37.803 --> 01:16:39.805
Would it not be
incredibly remiss...

01:16:39.838 --> 01:16:42.140
if I'd have done sooner
with this crime.

01:16:43.308 --> 01:16:44.710
Oh!

01:16:50.782 --> 01:16:52.651
You come bearing gifts.

01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:02.194
Stay alive and live,
my good man.

01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:11.103
Step in.

01:17:11.136 --> 01:17:12.904
Step in there.

01:17:12.938 --> 01:17:14.773
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

01:17:14.806 --> 01:17:17.309
- Shut up.
- Are you kidding me, Dan?

01:17:17.342 --> 01:17:20.078
- Are you serious?
- Lock it up.

01:17:20.112 --> 01:17:22.347
I wasn't even there,
I was with these guys...

01:17:22.381 --> 01:17:24.716
- Take your medicine, Dane.
- Are you kidding me?

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.185
Take your medicine.

01:17:27.219 --> 01:17:29.855
This is bullshit, Dan!

01:17:29.888 --> 01:17:33.759
For fuck's sake!

01:17:33.792 --> 01:17:35.127
Yo, beluga.

01:17:36.895 --> 01:17:38.230
Sit the fuck down.

01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:45.780
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Unlock that door!

01:17:45.804 --> 01:17:47.039
Unlock the gate!

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.043
Alright, come in. Back in
the cell, back in the cell.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.902
Hey!

01:18:18.303 --> 01:18:21.840
- You see the boy?
- What?

01:18:22.841 --> 01:18:24.176
He's hidin'.

01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:27.979
Maybe a neighborhood kiddie.

01:18:28.013 --> 01:18:30.082
I chased him,
but he keeps coming back.

01:18:34.853 --> 01:18:37.923
Oh, my God! Joseph did you
sleep out here last night?

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:41.493
Since Wednesday.

01:18:41.526 --> 01:18:44.062
It's Saturday.

01:18:46.598 --> 01:18:48.967
Did you see something
that scared you, honey?

01:18:50.435 --> 01:18:53.238
She acts differently lately.

01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:56.141
- It's my fault.
- It's alright.

01:18:57.576 --> 01:18:59.911
Let's get you cleaned up, honey.

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:06.551
- No!
- Enough!

01:19:06.585 --> 01:19:10.021
Joseph, you stop acting
like this right now!

01:19:10.055 --> 01:19:12.357
Jack and Ruddi were released
from jail this morning.

01:19:14.993 --> 01:19:17.329
They attacked Ed Hale last week.

01:19:17.362 --> 01:19:19.464
They couldn't hold them
'cause he-he was too afraid

01:19:19.498 --> 01:19:22.334
to tell anybody what happened.

01:19:22.367 --> 01:19:25.570
Now, those men are gonna
come after you, Joseph.

01:19:25.604 --> 01:19:27.005
And if you're gonna
stay like this

01:19:27.038 --> 01:19:28.840
it's gonna be
really easy for them

01:19:28.874 --> 01:19:31.009
to say that you disappeared
or had an accident.

01:19:32.377 --> 01:19:34.880
So we're gonna go into town...

01:19:34.913 --> 01:19:38.517
and we're gonna leave Bodega
Bay for a couple of weeks.

01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:41.520
We can stay in Redding,
Tom can look after your house.

01:19:44.022 --> 01:19:46.925
- Get up!
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna go.

01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:49.895
I just gotta get inside,
get some stuff.

01:19:49.928 --> 01:19:52.397
I'll meet you at Nickel's
in a... half hour.

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:54.366
How the hell
are you gonna do that?

01:19:54.399 --> 01:19:56.301
You-you've been out here
for almost a week!

01:19:56.334 --> 01:19:57.903
I have to!

01:20:01.072 --> 01:20:03.408
Thirty minutes...

01:20:03.441 --> 01:20:06.244
or I'm coming right back
to get you.

01:20:06.278 --> 01:20:07.479
Okay.

01:20:13.585 --> 01:20:14.986
Uh!

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:26.631
What's up, dog?

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.635
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:33.638
Jesus Christ.
You scared the shit out of me.

01:20:40.579 --> 01:20:43.014
When did you guys get out?

01:20:43.048 --> 01:20:45.083
I was just coming by
to lock up, I was, I was gonna

01:20:45.116 --> 01:20:46.694
go hunting up North,
I was gonna check and see

01:20:46.718 --> 01:20:49.054
if you guys need anything
before you hit the trail.

01:20:53.525 --> 01:20:55.227
Hey, hey. Hey! Come on, no!

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.661
Guys, come on!

01:20:56.695 --> 01:20:58.663
Where's Jack? Hey! Where's Jack?

01:20:58.697 --> 01:21:00.498
I wanna straighten things out
with him, okay?

01:21:00.532 --> 01:21:02.968
I just wanted to wait for him
to cool down a bit!

01:21:03.001 --> 01:21:04.178
Does he know you guys are here?

01:21:04.202 --> 01:21:10.141
♪ Oh oh oh ♪

01:21:12.677 --> 01:21:15.213
Come on, guys.
Ruddi, knock that off. Please.

01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:16.948
Grab a hammer,
get the shit off my window

01:21:16.982 --> 01:21:18.617
and let me out of here!

01:21:24.623 --> 01:21:27.058
Put that...
Put that down. Ruddi!

01:21:27.092 --> 01:21:28.226
Ruddi!

01:21:30.328 --> 01:21:31.997
Come on, I did my part, alright?

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.132
I kept my secret!

01:21:34.165 --> 01:21:37.002
I didn't say anything that he
wouldn't have already heard!

01:21:38.003 --> 01:21:39.537
Ruddi, put that...

01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:41.072
Ruddi.

01:21:41.106 --> 01:21:42.674
Ru-u-uddi!

01:21:42.707 --> 01:21:44.976
You heartless coward!

01:21:51.182 --> 01:21:54.185
Oh! Ah!

01:21:54.219 --> 01:21:56.288
Come, let's walk out of here!

01:22:10.101 --> 01:22:11.536
- Aah!
- It's me.

01:22:11.569 --> 01:22:13.271
It's just me.
Did you hear the truck?

01:22:13.305 --> 01:22:15.507
Looks like there's a big fire
out at Mitch's place.

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:19.010
Tom just headed out that way.
I don't like this.

01:22:19.044 --> 01:22:20.979
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:29.387
It's not everyday the penman
strolls in the town.

01:22:29.421 --> 01:22:30.741
It's big deal to people,
Mr. Hale.

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:35.260
He's a sick man and a recluse.
Do you want his story?

01:22:35.293 --> 01:22:36.704
You take him out of here
like you did

01:22:36.728 --> 01:22:39.264
with the Boyle brothers
in Indian country.

01:22:39.297 --> 01:22:41.499
What am I missing?

01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:44.469
Their own family...
could tell them the truth.

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:47.372
It doesn't matter.
He came back, she didn't.

01:22:50.342 --> 01:22:51.543
Glory?

01:22:53.578 --> 01:22:54.779
Glory!

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:21.272
Glory?

01:23:26.578 --> 01:23:27.612
Oh!

01:23:27.645 --> 01:23:30.515
Jesus Christ, Glory!

01:23:33.485 --> 01:23:34.686
Glory?

01:23:42.427 --> 01:23:43.628
Hi.

01:23:50.268 --> 01:23:51.636
It's Jack.

01:24:01.479 --> 01:24:02.680
Hi.

01:24:04.682 --> 01:24:06.684
Must be a fire, huh?

01:24:08.787 --> 01:24:10.789
I think it's over
at Mitch Captree's house.

01:24:10.822 --> 01:24:13.425
Captree? Is that so?

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:15.627
Hm, they better
get some people up there fast

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.762
before it all
gets scorched, huh?

01:24:20.298 --> 01:24:23.768
Please, don't hurt my dog.

01:24:23.802 --> 01:24:25.870
What?

01:24:25.904 --> 01:24:27.806
I would never hurt an animal.

01:24:27.839 --> 01:24:29.541
I love her.

01:24:29.574 --> 01:24:31.476
She's my friend.

01:24:33.211 --> 01:24:35.280
She should be inside.

01:24:35.313 --> 01:24:38.349
Animals just know, you know?

01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:41.319
They're not like us.
They're not like people.

01:24:41.352 --> 01:24:42.863
They don't have
to experience everything

01:24:42.887 --> 01:24:45.723
through pain and suffering.

01:24:45.757 --> 01:24:47.759
Why did you come here?

01:24:50.528 --> 01:24:53.164
I wanted to apologize to you...

01:24:53.198 --> 01:24:54.766
for the other day at Tom's bar.

01:24:54.799 --> 01:24:58.470
I... probably made you feel
a little uneasy.

01:24:59.537 --> 01:25:01.806
Yeah? That wasn't my intention.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.209
What was your intention?

01:25:04.242 --> 01:25:05.610
To send a man to the hospital

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:07.612
just for doing a story
about your family?

01:25:07.645 --> 01:25:10.281
I can't control my brother.
I tried!

01:25:10.315 --> 01:25:11.583
I tried, I tried, I tried

01:25:11.616 --> 01:25:14.619
and I tried again!
It doesn't work!

01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:16.287
You know,
Joseph's not the only person

01:25:16.321 --> 01:25:18.490
being persecuted
and judged in this town.

01:25:18.523 --> 01:25:21.292
I wasn't even there!

01:25:21.326 --> 01:25:24.395
- You weren't?
- I was not!

01:25:24.429 --> 01:25:26.965
Oh, so you're not
going after Joseph.

01:25:26.998 --> 01:25:30.168
Why would I?
It won't bring my sister back.

01:25:32.237 --> 01:25:34.606
Will it? No.

01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:36.407
No.

01:25:36.441 --> 01:25:39.277
I said what I needed to say.
That's it.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.250
Can I have my dog back, please?

01:25:45.283 --> 01:25:46.885
Of course.

01:25:46.918 --> 01:25:49.287
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.889
There you go.

01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:54.692
Easy, go easy.

01:25:56.261 --> 01:25:57.362
Thank you.

01:25:57.395 --> 01:25:59.597
- So beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:26:01.699 --> 01:26:03.301
Thank you.

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:10.341
What, that?

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:12.310
That's just ink and immaturity.

01:26:12.343 --> 01:26:14.979
That's nothing,
that's not gonna hurt you.

01:26:15.013 --> 01:26:17.482
Come on, I just wanna be
treated equal.

01:26:18.583 --> 01:26:20.451
Just like Joseph.

01:26:22.654 --> 01:26:24.455
Friends?

01:26:24.489 --> 01:26:25.757
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:27.492
Okay. Now, come on.

01:26:27.525 --> 01:26:29.227
Aah!

01:26:31.296 --> 01:26:33.031
Oh, no!

01:26:33.064 --> 01:26:34.465
Ha...

01:26:35.533 --> 01:26:37.402
Look at this hair.

01:26:38.903 --> 01:26:40.805
You look like her.

01:26:41.673 --> 01:26:42.874
Yeah.

01:26:42.907 --> 01:26:44.809
I can see why he likes you.

01:26:46.578 --> 01:26:48.279
Hi, Mr. Hale,
how are you feeling?

01:26:48.313 --> 01:26:50.915
Uh, good. Listen, I need you
to tell me something.

01:26:50.949 --> 01:26:53.518
It's very important.

01:26:53.551 --> 01:26:55.520
When you booked
my room out here...

01:26:56.888 --> 01:26:59.057
how did you find
Mitch Captree's place?

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:02.060
Captree? Um, let me see.

01:27:02.093 --> 01:27:04.996
You know what?
He actually contacted us.

01:27:05.029 --> 01:27:06.464
- Mr. Hale?
- You know what, Bill?

01:27:06.497 --> 01:27:07.808
This isn't
rocket science here, okay?

01:27:07.832 --> 01:27:09.901
'Cause anytime
any shit goes down...

01:27:09.934 --> 01:27:11.769
Motherfucker!

01:27:11.803 --> 01:27:13.571
Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

01:27:13.605 --> 01:27:15.482
- Knock it off. Alright.
- What'd you mean, knock it off?

01:27:15.506 --> 01:27:16.808
Don't jump to conclusions.

01:27:16.841 --> 01:27:18.419
Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

01:27:18.443 --> 01:27:19.820
Don't tell me
that was an accident, Billy!

01:27:19.844 --> 01:27:21.846
Don't jump to the conclusions,
Tom, alright?

01:27:21.879 --> 01:27:23.591
- Let's just stick to the facts!
- What happened?

01:27:23.615 --> 01:27:24.983
It was Ruddi and Dane.

01:27:25.016 --> 01:27:26.551
You fucking let them out?

01:27:26.584 --> 01:27:27.861
I couldn't hold them any longer.

01:27:27.885 --> 01:27:29.988
You didn't wanna identify them,
Mr. Hale.

01:27:31.689 --> 01:27:32.824
Sweetie.

01:27:32.857 --> 01:27:34.392
Over here!

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.729
Oh, hi, Joseph.

01:27:37.762 --> 01:27:39.797
Hi, it's me, Annabel?

01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:41.766
Your long lost love.

01:27:41.799 --> 01:27:44.435
Oh, I need you to save me.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:46.371
Save me from the water.

01:27:46.404 --> 01:27:49.841
Save me from the whales, Joseph.

01:27:49.874 --> 01:27:52.677
- Save me from myself.
- Where is she?

01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:54.746
Oh, you really wanna know,
you big...

01:27:54.779 --> 01:27:56.981
- Yes.
- Why?

01:27:57.015 --> 01:27:58.549
Why, huh?

01:27:58.583 --> 01:28:01.052
So you can go rescue the girl

01:28:01.085 --> 01:28:03.121
and save the day?

01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:04.555
Mm...

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:08.760
Are you a fucking idiot?

01:28:08.793 --> 01:28:11.529
You're a fucking idiot.

01:28:11.562 --> 01:28:12.940
Do you know
what Jack is gonna do to you

01:28:12.964 --> 01:28:14.565
when you go down there?

01:28:14.599 --> 01:28:17.068
He's gonna beat you to death

01:28:17.101 --> 01:28:19.804
and leave you face down
in the water.

01:28:20.738 --> 01:28:22.407
Is that what you want?

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.776
Is it? I don't think
that's what you want.

01:28:24.809 --> 01:28:26.110
- Huh?
- Stop it! Stop.

01:28:26.144 --> 01:28:28.413
You know what I think
you want, Joseph?

01:28:28.446 --> 01:28:30.448
I think you wanna
stay here with me.

01:28:30.481 --> 01:28:32.750
We can go find Viagra and back.

01:28:32.784 --> 01:28:34.919
Uh-huh? It's gonna be fun.

01:28:34.952 --> 01:28:36.921
So much more fun
than you're gonna have.

01:28:36.954 --> 01:28:39.390
- Shut up!
- You're my husband.

01:28:39.424 --> 01:28:40.692
Tell me where they took her!

01:28:40.725 --> 01:28:42.660
I like it when you get rough.

01:28:42.694 --> 01:28:44.696
I fucking like it!

01:28:44.729 --> 01:28:46.130
Okay.

01:28:46.164 --> 01:28:48.366
Do it the hard way...

01:28:49.133 --> 01:28:50.601
hero.

01:28:51.436 --> 01:28:53.104
They...

01:28:53.137 --> 01:28:55.773
are where the lie started.

01:28:55.807 --> 01:28:58.142
Where you killed my best friend.

01:28:58.176 --> 01:29:01.612
I think you know exactly where
that is, don't you, Joseph?

01:29:03.915 --> 01:29:05.116
Dusty.

01:29:06.451 --> 01:29:08.519
You're an ugly person.

01:29:11.923 --> 01:29:13.591
Oh, well, lucky for me, Joseph

01:29:13.624 --> 01:29:16.060
'cause we know what you do
to the beautiful ones!

01:29:23.735 --> 01:29:26.137
We're on highway three
right up here.

01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:28.773
Know this place like
the back of my hand.

01:29:38.783 --> 01:29:40.852
It-it's a lie, it's a lie!
They set me up.

01:29:40.885 --> 01:29:42.596
They sent me because
it's hard to get out of here.

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.621
It's a lie! Oh, God!

01:29:43.654 --> 01:29:45.523
Get back! Get back!

01:29:45.556 --> 01:29:47.191
- Dane!
- Shut the fuck up, Tom!

01:29:47.225 --> 01:29:49.026
You wanna help this asshole?

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.729
Then you're a fucking asshole,
too! You're fucking get me?

01:29:51.763 --> 01:29:53.998
No one gets through
but Hawthorne!

01:29:54.031 --> 01:29:57.668
And you, you fucking silly boy,
pussy, motherfucker!

01:29:57.702 --> 01:29:59.203
Did you get the story
you wanted?

01:29:59.237 --> 01:30:01.639
Did you get the story
you wanted?

01:30:01.672 --> 01:30:03.875
You're...

01:30:03.908 --> 01:30:05.777
You're right,
it's just so fucked up...

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:08.613
oh, that you can't even
jerk off, can you?

01:30:08.646 --> 01:30:09.814
Oh, my God! I...

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.061
Oh, no...

01:30:25.797 --> 01:30:27.064
You...

01:30:27.098 --> 01:30:28.666
- Ed?
- Is he alright?

01:30:28.699 --> 01:30:30.501
- I don't know.
- Come on, get him on.

01:30:30.535 --> 01:30:32.703
Hey. Here, listen up.

01:30:32.737 --> 01:30:34.648
You gotta get to town, okay?
You gotta get the sheriff.

01:30:34.672 --> 01:30:36.808
- Get him out here.
- Okay. Okay. Alright.

01:30:36.841 --> 01:30:38.552
Am I gonna get in trouble
for hitting him like that?

01:30:38.576 --> 01:30:39.920
You're fine.
You did the right thing.

01:30:39.944 --> 01:30:42.547
- Go.
- Okay. Okay.

01:30:44.015 --> 01:30:45.183
Ed?

01:30:46.284 --> 01:30:48.085
- Did he change, Anne?
- Go!

01:30:48.119 --> 01:30:49.687
- Did he change?
- Get help! Go!

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.198
- Did he change, Anne?
- Hey! Hey! Look at me.

01:30:51.222 --> 01:30:53.191
- Did he change?
- Look at me, not at her!

01:30:53.224 --> 01:30:55.259
Look! Can you
get your arms around...

01:30:55.293 --> 01:30:57.004
Can you get your arms
around this? Hold this!

01:30:57.028 --> 01:30:59.263
You gotta hold it! Listen. Hey!

01:30:59.297 --> 01:31:01.199
Look at me.
This isn't a game anymore, okay?

01:31:01.232 --> 01:31:02.676
- No, no, no, I don't...
- If Ruddi...

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.769
- Listen to me!
- I don't want this!

01:31:04.802 --> 01:31:07.271
If Ruddi and Jack come after
you, you gotta drop 'em, okay?

01:31:07.305 --> 01:31:09.740
Otherwise, they're gonna
kill you. You understand me?

01:31:09.774 --> 01:31:12.276
You gotta go a quarter mile
down this road, you run.

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:14.245
Lawman's bluff,
below the field, okay?

01:31:14.278 --> 01:31:15.622
You're gonna
cut through the cliffs

01:31:15.646 --> 01:31:16.966
I'm gonna meet you there.
Now, go.

01:31:32.063 --> 01:31:34.765
Come out, you fucking coward!

01:31:48.846 --> 01:31:52.116
Where are you,
you fucking pussy?

01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:53.618
Come on!

01:31:55.987 --> 01:31:57.188
Hey.

01:32:06.631 --> 01:32:08.032
Help me!

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.703
Ah! Joseph, please help me!

01:32:13.838 --> 01:32:16.641
Come on in! Come get her!

01:32:19.744 --> 01:32:21.279
Wait!

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:26.284
- Sweetie!
- Joseph!

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.889
What's wrong, bro? Come get her!

01:32:36.861 --> 01:32:39.664
So cold. She need you!

01:32:41.032 --> 01:32:42.900
Well, I'll help you out.

01:32:43.668 --> 01:32:45.970
You bastard!

01:32:46.003 --> 01:32:47.638
Go on ahead.

01:32:52.376 --> 01:32:54.612
I'll make you a deal.

01:32:56.247 --> 01:32:58.349
Be a man...

01:32:58.382 --> 01:33:00.351
and come get her...

01:33:00.384 --> 01:33:02.653
and I'll go. Careful.

01:33:03.955 --> 01:33:07.224
Don't let the water
get you, Joseph.

01:33:09.427 --> 01:33:11.829
Is that how hard you tried
for Annabel?

01:33:23.774 --> 01:33:25.014
Now there's blood in the water.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.395
Somebody...

01:33:44.428 --> 01:33:46.063
Somebody help!

01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:55.373
Hi. Come back, bird.

01:33:56.841 --> 01:33:59.477
Oh, no, no, no. Come back, bird.

01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:01.112
Back to your cage.

01:34:05.816 --> 01:34:08.719
Hey! Hey!

01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:15.726
Should have known better.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.129
Should have left, writer man.

01:34:20.031 --> 01:34:21.475
Should have left
when you had the chance.

01:34:21.499 --> 01:34:24.168
Help!

01:34:24.201 --> 01:34:26.771
Thought you were
supposed to be smart.

01:34:26.804 --> 01:34:28.973
Huh! Where you going?

01:34:35.146 --> 01:34:36.347
Help!

01:34:49.093 --> 01:34:51.162
Hey, hey.

01:34:52.963 --> 01:34:54.131
Hey.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.275
I need you to...

01:35:05.276 --> 01:35:07.311
I need you to do me a favor.

01:35:12.450 --> 01:35:14.452
I need you to...

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.323
tell my sister...

01:35:19.356 --> 01:35:21.759
I'm gonna quit drinking
in the spring.

01:35:23.327 --> 01:35:24.528
No!

01:35:56.994 --> 01:35:59.196
I can't have my sister back

01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:00.331
but I can have you.

01:36:00.364 --> 01:36:04.101
Joseph! Please...

01:36:04.135 --> 01:36:06.070
We'll do this together.

01:36:06.103 --> 01:36:08.339
You and me together, right?

01:36:08.372 --> 01:36:10.174
You saw her go...

01:36:10.207 --> 01:36:11.475
now I'm gonna watch you go.

01:36:11.509 --> 01:36:14.278
Please! Stop!

01:36:17.314 --> 01:36:19.316
Jack! No!

01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:21.619
Let her take you.
Just let her take you.

01:36:21.652 --> 01:36:24.388
Just let her take you
at the sea like you...

01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:27.057
like you...

01:36:31.162 --> 01:36:33.230
Telling him to fight there,
were you, piece of shit?

01:36:35.032 --> 01:36:37.334
Let's lose the shiv, huh?

01:37:03.994 --> 01:37:04.995
Joseph!

01:37:27.117 --> 01:37:29.954
Help! Somebody, help!

01:37:31.322 --> 01:37:33.924
Ed! Ed!

01:37:33.958 --> 01:37:35.492
Shoot him!

01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:55.446
- Wait. Wait. Wait.
- No!

01:37:55.479 --> 01:37:56.714
- Where you...
- No!

01:37:56.747 --> 01:37:58.249
Let him go.

01:37:58.282 --> 01:38:01.051
No!

01:38:01.085 --> 01:38:03.587
- Let him go.
- No.

01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:08.425
I've missed you, my friend.

01:38:10.995 --> 01:38:13.097
- Whale.
- Joseph!

01:38:13.130 --> 01:38:15.165
The girl on the boat.

01:38:15.199 --> 01:38:17.368
Your imperishable love.

01:38:18.702 --> 01:38:20.104
Tell me.

01:38:21.405 --> 01:38:22.606
Yes.

01:38:37.321 --> 01:38:38.522
Honey!

01:38:38.555 --> 01:38:40.591
Honey, look out there.
Do you see?

01:38:41.759 --> 01:38:44.395
This is why we came! Look!

01:39:00.144 --> 01:39:02.212
Hey, honey, how you doing?
You ready?

01:39:02.246 --> 01:39:04.515
Come on, we're so close.

01:39:04.548 --> 01:39:06.226
Look, it's why we came out here.
Five more minutes.

01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:08.552
- Five more minutes.
- I'm not, I'm not standing up.

01:39:08.585 --> 01:39:11.522
Will you look at how amazingly
close we are. Look.

01:39:11.555 --> 01:39:14.491
Do you see them?
We've never been this close.

01:39:14.525 --> 01:39:16.360
Come on, honey.
Just walk up with me.

01:39:16.393 --> 01:39:19.029
You can hold me the whole time.
I got you. I got you, I swear.

01:39:19.063 --> 01:39:22.099
- I just not...
- Last request, please.

01:39:22.132 --> 01:39:23.567
Come on, look who...

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.502
You're gonna love it. Come on.

01:39:25.536 --> 01:39:28.706
- Hurry!
- Just, just be careful, okay?

01:39:30.274 --> 01:39:33.510
Look! Look out there.

01:39:33.544 --> 01:39:35.579
There are three of them.

01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:42.386
- Wow! It's amazing!
- Yeah.

01:39:42.419 --> 01:39:43.797
Have you ever seen a whale
that close before?

01:39:43.821 --> 01:39:45.522
No, no, no.

01:39:45.556 --> 01:39:47.057
Hey, don't. N-not over...

01:39:47.091 --> 01:39:49.660
Oh, well, they're coming
right towards us.

01:39:49.693 --> 01:39:51.829
Oh, my God!

01:39:51.862 --> 01:39:53.630
Look at that.

01:39:56.567 --> 01:39:59.169
Wow! You can almost touch them.

01:40:02.206 --> 01:40:03.440
Whoa! Be careful!

01:40:03.474 --> 01:40:06.243
I'm fine, honey.
Just hold on to me.

01:40:06.276 --> 01:40:08.379
I know you like it, baby,
but you gotta be careful.

01:40:08.412 --> 01:40:09.856
I'm not gonna fall.
You've got me, don't you?

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.315
- Yes.
- And you got the boat.

01:40:11.348 --> 01:40:12.816
- We're gonna be fine.
- Okay, okay.

01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:14.284
Okay, look.

01:41:21.318 --> 01:41:23.520
I didn't kill my wife!

01:42:07.431 --> 01:42:09.867
Annabel!

01:42:13.437 --> 01:42:14.872
I love you!

01:42:26.016 --> 01:42:28.785
You're ready to swim with me,
my friend.
