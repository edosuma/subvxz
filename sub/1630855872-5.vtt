WEBVTT

00:36.036 --> 00:38.706
ALL CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES

00:38.789 --> 00:40.958
AND SETTINGS DEPICTED
ARE FICTIONAL

01:07.610 --> 01:09.987
-I have Mr. Lee secured.
-Okay.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.739
Time to start the whale hunt.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.205
What is this?

01:19.288 --> 01:20.372
First,

01:20.456 --> 01:24.043
tell us why you requested
the press conference.

01:25.169 --> 01:29.465
I'd like to confess the crimes I committed
during my time

01:29.548 --> 01:30.674
as the Prosecution.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.261
As a former prosecutor myself,

01:34.345 --> 01:36.263
this sort of press conference

01:36.347 --> 01:40.059
is susceptible to
a defamation and libel lawsuit.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.020
No law can punish one
for telling the truth.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.439
Then,

01:45.523 --> 01:48.484
why don't you introduce yourself?

02:07.545 --> 02:08.712
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

02:08.796 --> 02:10.548
I am

02:10.631 --> 02:13.467
the daughter of CEO Yoon Hye-rin,
who died unjustly

02:13.551 --> 02:16.136
due to corrupt power dealings.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.806
I'm also a co-conspirator
in the bribery manipulation case

02:18.889 --> 02:21.517
which caused her untimely death.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.108
Cancel Chief's afternoon itinerary.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.613
I'd like to ask the person
who co-conspired with me,

02:34.697 --> 02:37.449
Chief Hwang Gi-seok
of Special Investigations,

02:38.576 --> 02:40.286
what is justice…

02:40.369 --> 02:41.620
FORMER PROSECUTOR CONFESSES

02:41.704 --> 02:42.913
…to you?

02:49.545 --> 02:53.841
We had no idea
Park Joon-gyeong would work with Baek.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.801
This wasn't her idea.

02:55.885 --> 02:57.428
Then whose?

03:07.771 --> 03:09.607
-Three years ago…
-I'm watching it.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.443
-Little bitch is fierce.
-my mother was interrogated…

03:12.526 --> 03:14.236
You mentioned Jang's uncle.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.156
He has relations with Park?

03:17.239 --> 03:19.408
Manager Eun must have had known

03:19.491 --> 03:21.994
the late CEO Yoon.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.164
Are you sure this Eun Yong
is taken care of?

03:25.247 --> 03:29.084
I personally saw to it in real time.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.629
Don't worry, Gi-seok.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.339
It's for times like this

03:33.422 --> 03:36.926
that I bought drinks for CEO Oh
and the old geezers at Seocho-dong.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.929
What the hell?

03:41.639 --> 03:44.141
I'm Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.
Seoul Central District Office.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.976
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

03:46.644 --> 03:50.773
Attorney Lee has been arrested
for misappropriation and malpractice.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.691
You are also under arrest

03:52.775 --> 03:55.402
-for the same crimes.
-What?

03:55.486 --> 03:56.528
…documents of evidence.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.490
What the--
The hell do you think you're doing?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.575
Don't you know who I am, you shits?

04:01.659 --> 04:03.118
I'll strip you of your titles!

04:03.202 --> 04:06.038
-Let me go!
-You have the right not to testify.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.958
You may choose your attorney,
or have your son-in-law threaten us.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.752
-But first, please come with us.
-What did you say?

04:11.835 --> 04:15.547
Hey, let go now! I said, let go!

04:15.631 --> 04:19.677
Chief Hwang had me arrested
in order to conceal the truth…

04:19.760 --> 04:21.261
I won't let this slide!

04:28.143 --> 04:29.478
He's here.

04:37.987 --> 04:42.199
Myungdong's loan shark,
charged with stealing from company assets,

04:42.282 --> 04:45.661
has been revealed as
the father-in-law of Chief Hwang,

04:45.744 --> 04:48.330
recently under fire
for prosecutorial misconduct.

04:48.414 --> 04:51.458
Public interest is surging
amidst suspicions

04:51.542 --> 04:54.586
against high-level prosecutors'
cover-up practices.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.471
Our deal is still on.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.308
The contract you proposed as collateral.
It's gone, no?

05:08.392 --> 05:10.102
It may be gone,

05:10.185 --> 05:11.979
but as you can see, I'm fine.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.525
Since the situation has changed,
here's a new proposition for you.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.986
I hear the Prosecutor who arrested
Chairman Myung

05:19.069 --> 05:20.487
is your nephew?

05:21.071 --> 05:23.365
I doubt you'll conjure up anything

05:24.158 --> 05:26.660
with a low-level prosecutor like him.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.455
You're right.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.582
In order to size up to Hwang,

05:32.583 --> 05:34.418
he'll need your support.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.086
Why would I do that?

05:38.255 --> 05:39.798
I will make you

05:40.424 --> 05:41.884
a National Assemblyman.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.220
Offering a gift this time?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.600
Listen, my friend.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.311
They say,
you can't do politics without money,

05:53.145 --> 05:55.314
but money isn't everything either.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.566
This sounds too familiar.

05:57.649 --> 06:01.487
Chairman Myung also promised me
a local constituency--

06:01.570 --> 06:04.239
What about Assemblyman Baek's
Third District?

06:04.323 --> 06:06.241
It's a stronghold for the ruling party.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.786
Would that be possible?

06:11.163 --> 06:13.624
Baek has little hope in the next election.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.167
I would think

06:15.250 --> 06:17.127
he understands that more than anyone.

06:21.799 --> 06:25.219
Which means more people will strive
to take his seat.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.680
But regarding money,

06:28.764 --> 06:29.973
I top them all.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.185
As you know,
I've grown pretty close with Baek.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.441
INCOMING CALL
CHIEF HWANG GI-SEOK

06:45.239 --> 06:47.407
If you don't take that call…

06:50.452 --> 06:53.580
I'm going to assume
you're sealing the deal with me.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.215
I promise I didn't know.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.175
Hwang, you know how this goes.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.846
Doing arrests without a warrant.
It's to feed the press before anything.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.015
Jang did this unilaterally,
without his superior's approval?

07:12.099 --> 07:14.601
I'm serious.
The bastard didn't report a word of this.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.727
You dumbass.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.898
You call yourself a chief,
and that's the best excuse you got?

07:19.982 --> 07:22.359
Listen, I'm really sorry.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.944
But Hwang, listen.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.822
Arrests without warrants
only last 48 hours.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.200
I'll take care of everything
during the suspect examination.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.035
Chief Park.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.665
Chief Park.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.794
-Hey, Jeong-su.
-Hey, come on. Let go.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.005
Fine.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.716
Punch me if you want.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.685
Let's do this right, okay?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.314
Report to me in real time.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.025
Of course, man.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.406
Gi-seok.

08:14.870 --> 08:18.290
My transfer to Busan.
It's still happening, right?

08:18.373 --> 08:22.461
I already signed a lease
to an apartment in Haeundae.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.094
PROSECUTION SERVICE

08:36.391 --> 08:38.393
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE

09:11.343 --> 09:13.178
Your father-in-law

09:13.262 --> 09:14.930
is in our interrogation room.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.267
I'll give you time to speak to him.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.894
He's a suspect in your case.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.147
Let's not create any misunderstandings.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.317
Chief Hwang.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.073
I'm going to find my own way

09:33.657 --> 09:35.284
to the seventh floor.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.292
Catch a Special Investigations prosecutor,

09:43.375 --> 09:45.002
then enter Special Investigations.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.190
PROSECUTOR JANG TAE-CHUN

10:20.620 --> 10:22.247
Is Myung's attorney here?

10:26.168 --> 10:29.254
Three more have submitted
the application for appointment.

10:29.338 --> 10:32.049
Six men equal in rank
to the district chief.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.342
Oh, man.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.054
It'll be a challenge
to even get an arrest warrant.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.724
We caused the commotion,

10:40.807 --> 10:41.975
but can we pull through?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.437
You said it yourself.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.855
Fail to get him…

10:48.315 --> 10:49.483
or die.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.624
So, you're back on with CEO Oh?

11:12.464 --> 11:13.465
TEMPORARY PRESS PASS

11:13.548 --> 11:15.801
He gave me a press pass.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.554
Now you can come and go,
without leaving records.

11:20.764 --> 11:24.601
Wow, how much is this thing?

11:24.684 --> 11:28.522
One little line in this logo
is probably worth a building.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.691
The middle line symbolizes uprightness.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.819
The others: fairness, truth, justice,

11:33.902 --> 11:35.779
and human rights.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.322
Wow.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.908
Is that a question in the bar exam?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.417
Having you become a prosecutor,

11:48.500 --> 11:51.044
I hoped this country would change
for the better.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.464
Do you ever regret quitting?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.802
Nothing in the world is for free.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.888
What about you?

12:02.973 --> 12:05.559
You won't regret wasting your fortune
on revenge?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.394
What do you mean "wasting"?

12:08.186 --> 12:12.149
I'm investing money into knocking sense
into South Korea's Prosecution.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.818
Listen, these lines mean:

12:15.694 --> 12:17.279
Fairness, justice…

12:20.615 --> 12:23.326
Can't be "quick delivery."
What'd you say it was?

12:25.454 --> 12:27.456
Those qualities can't be bought.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.881
You do what money can't buy,

12:35.964 --> 12:38.383
by returning to the Prosecution.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.219
You've left the military,
so return to Prosecution.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.139
I'll cook something up
for resigned prosecutors

12:44.222 --> 12:45.891
to get re-hired.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.482
No big deal.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.447
ARREST WARRANT

13:00.530 --> 13:03.533
Myung and Attorney Lee aren't talking,
but the evidence is solid--

13:03.617 --> 13:08.038
So, the patent office official claims
the money was borrowed and not a bribe?

13:08.121 --> 13:12.250
Yes, but I'll find the forged document
and prove its quid pro quo nature…

13:14.252 --> 13:17.631
I mean, I'll fix any inadequacies
and report back immediately.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.218
I'm ready for any criticism.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.720
I'll fix the papers a hundred times
if I have to.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.185
-You're good.
-What?

13:31.811 --> 13:32.896
It's approved.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.525
Even the court won't be able to nullify
an arrest warrant like this.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.443
You're approving this at first go?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.695
Once is enough, no?

13:41.238 --> 13:42.989
I'll allocate all other cases

13:43.073 --> 13:44.866
to Prosecutor Choi.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.576
You concentrate on this case for now.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.498
Let's go, kid. Get to work.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.042
Crack this big case.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.628
Let's get you promoted
to Special Investigations.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.213
Go, Tae-chun!

13:59.756 --> 14:02.634
We, at Change Investment Partners,

14:02.717 --> 14:05.637
invested capital
into high income funds per sector.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.556
Each high income fund management company

14:07.639 --> 14:10.642
executes investments coinciding
with policy objectives.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.520
After Hong Kong's market close,
it's Shanghai, then London.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.355
Six and a half hours later, New York.

14:15.438 --> 14:19.401
Three hours later,
it's Seoul, Tokyo, and Sydney.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.821
Our fund investments move
around the clock.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.740
Myung managed these men through CEO Oh,

14:25.824 --> 14:27.867
all equal in rank to the district chief.

14:27.951 --> 14:32.581
When you want to make a deal,
you must hit the core of their desires.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.583
…we find flexible solutions.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.552
You get to a certain position,
then you get easy money, right?

14:45.635 --> 14:48.305
You have connections
and plenty of information.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.265
But the question is,

14:50.348 --> 14:51.725
can you use that money

14:51.808 --> 14:55.645
without drawing unwanted attention?

14:57.314 --> 14:59.232
Eton College in London.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.776
Collingwood School in Vancouver.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.488
Yew Chung in Beijing.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.284
Your children studying overseas
can draw any amount of money,

15:09.367 --> 15:11.745
whenever and wherever they are.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.665
You all have been subjected to
financial investigations.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.916
I assume you know it well.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.296
It may take time to dig through
Myung's borrowed-name accounts,

15:22.005 --> 15:24.633
but it's bound to be exposed
with strong intent.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.218
I believe that's why you've always been

15:27.302 --> 15:29.679
slightly anxious and uncomfortable inside.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.266
But our offshore mutual funds…

15:33.350 --> 15:36.853
are impossible to trace.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.940
Unlimited foreign exchange transactions.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.151
The lowest tax rate in the world.

15:43.234 --> 15:46.488
Whatever confirmation hearing you face,

15:46.571 --> 15:51.159
we promise you won't need
to publicly disclose your wealth increase.

15:51.242 --> 15:55.580
We understand the basic difference
between your fund and Myung's.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.874
But…

15:57.957 --> 15:59.084
Sir.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.962
I ordered the inspection
against Hwang as you asked,

16:03.546 --> 16:06.383
but isn't he too valuable to just rid of?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.345
Look, Director of Inspection.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.972
Think of the Prosecution as a whole.

16:13.682 --> 16:17.227
Keeping someone marred by the press
is a burden to the institution.

16:20.480 --> 16:26.403
I think our faultless Chief Park
would be great as his successor, no?

16:27.445 --> 16:30.448
I'm Chief Park Jeong-su.
Thank you for your consideration.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.311
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
OF HUMANE RESPECT

17:08.027 --> 17:10.113
Did I come too early?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.615
Ma'am, your visitation is delayed
by 30 minutes.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.743
Apparently, someone else is visiting him.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.120
Who is it?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.205
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
DETENTION CENTER

17:19.289 --> 17:21.249
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS,
WE'LL HELP

17:25.920 --> 17:27.380
Been a while, Chairman.

17:27.464 --> 17:31.509
Well, look who it is.
It's Yong, our Manager Eun!

17:36.264 --> 17:40.977
Kid, why don't you ever visit me
during the holidays?

17:41.728 --> 17:44.147
You sure lack manners.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.775
It's good to see you're healthy.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.693
How is your health?

17:51.154 --> 17:54.657
I heard you got
into a pretty bad car accident.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.165
I have to outlive you, no?

18:02.874 --> 18:05.210
I'm a lot younger and much richer.

18:05.293 --> 18:09.756
If that's the case,
live like a king in the pastures.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.383
Why'd you crawl back here?

18:14.135 --> 18:18.598
I can't stand being indebted to someone,
so I came to pay my dues,

18:18.681 --> 18:20.308
and to exact revenge.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.643
That so?

18:23.019 --> 18:28.316
You think you can pull it off
with the kid prosecutor?

18:29.818 --> 18:34.197
You can't indict me
with misappropriation and malpractice.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.201
I'll pay some fine, then it'll be over.

18:38.284 --> 18:42.247
I learned more from you
than just money business, didn't I?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.921
I purchased one too.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.717
Oh, one moment.

18:59.097 --> 19:03.601
Apparently, the suspect evaluation's done.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.854
The court has issued the warrant.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.105
What?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.025
Chairman.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.612
You should take this chance
and do some self-reflection.

19:14.696 --> 19:18.825
Meanwhile, I'll dig up the wealth
you illegally stashed

19:18.908 --> 19:20.660
with the kid prosecutor.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.498
Let me be a patriot.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.167
I'll retrieve your money
and aid the government funds.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.130
Farewell.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.028
INCOMING CALL

19:55.111 --> 19:56.446
HWANG GI-SEOK,
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

20:00.491 --> 20:02.243
Hello, Gi-seok.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.787
Why the hell is the arrest warrant issued?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.498
Gi-seok, what's all the rage?

20:07.582 --> 20:11.169
The thing is,
the evidence was pretty overwhelming.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.756
-What, you bastard?
-Come on, Gi-seok.

20:14.839 --> 20:19.344
Stop bugging me with unnecessary matters
and get ready to be inspected.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.973
Hey, if you open a law firm,
I'll get you a large bouquet.

20:24.057 --> 20:27.185
Are you sure you won't regret
what you just said?

20:27.268 --> 20:29.228
I've been in regret for a long time.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.440
I lost the deposit on that apartment
and canceled the contract.

20:33.024 --> 20:36.819
I hear there may be changes
during the next promotional season.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.697
You can't--

20:42.700 --> 20:43.993
Chief Hwang Gi-seok.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.954
Supreme Prosecutors' Office, here.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.038
SUSPENSION ORDER

20:47.121 --> 20:48.498
As of this moment, you are suspended

20:48.581 --> 20:50.750
from all of your duties
until the inspection is over.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.103
LET'S LIVE A CHEERFUL
AND ORDERLY LIFE

21:10.186 --> 21:11.980
EVIL BEGETS SIN,
GOOD BEGETS BLESSING

21:14.023 --> 21:16.609
PATIENCE IS THE BEST MEDICINE
FOR ANY AFFLICTION

21:21.823 --> 21:24.200
You go ahead. I'll catch up soon.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.284
Yes, ma'am.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.457
EARN TRUST WITH KIND WORDS

21:32.750 --> 21:34.460
He seems healthy.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.796
If you were by his side,

21:36.879 --> 21:38.673
this wouldn't have happened.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.384
You knew we weren't going to last long.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.054
That's why I liked you.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.348
When it comes to money,

21:47.432 --> 21:50.268
you're practically reflections
of each other,

21:50.351 --> 21:53.938
but you two differ
in how you treat your family.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.652
Yes, you weren't like your father either.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.532
That's why I plan to protect my family.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.911
I guess our relationship
is an ill-fated one after all.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.207
See you around.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.059
Heard the warrant was issued, right?

22:31.142 --> 22:34.187
Well, our Chairman is fucked.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.399
And I'm royally fucked.

22:38.483 --> 22:42.403
You're a lawyer and a veteran prosecutor,
so you'd know.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.322
Might as well admit your crimes.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.241
Wouldn't it better to cooperate?

22:51.537 --> 22:52.747
Look here.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.084
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.378
-Yes?
-You beat up a teacher at school, right?

23:00.588 --> 23:03.800
You beat him up with a chair,
got him hospitalized for… 8 weeks?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.093
Anyhow.

23:05.843 --> 23:08.054
Though you were a minor,
it was a severe crime.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.765
You should've gone to juvie
for at least two years.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.893
The prosecutor who got you out?

23:15.478 --> 23:16.521
It was me.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.693
Wow, now that I think about it,

23:22.777 --> 23:25.738
we have a debt to settle.

23:25.822 --> 23:30.159
Let's face it. If weren't for me,
you'd be in and out of juvie.

23:30.243 --> 23:34.455
It could've been you sitting here
in my place, no?

23:39.335 --> 23:42.463
Since you sure know
how to bribe and be bribed.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.052
I understand you took a hefty sum
back then.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.638
Wow, you know me so well.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.058
Speaking of,

23:55.017 --> 23:57.937
tell your uncle this.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.898
Tell him to pay me a visit.

24:00.982 --> 24:03.609
We can work out a good deal again.

24:07.405 --> 24:10.825
I'll give you all the testimony you want.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.410
Okay?

24:21.335 --> 24:23.588
This is the testimony
I gave with Assemblyman Baek

24:23.671 --> 24:25.923
at the press conference,
regarding the scandal.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.760
That's a timeline of the conspiracy

24:29.844 --> 24:31.470
I partook with Hwang.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.390
Are these good for burden of proof?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.685
The tampered files are
under forensic inspection.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.438
Just bring them here.
We'll do the forensics.

24:42.023 --> 24:46.027
I don't trust the Prosecution,
so I gave it to a reputable institution.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.614
I'll submit more evidence,
just so there aren't any issues.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.949
All right, good going.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.327
No wonder you were top of your class.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.078
You can return to your post.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.582
You won't be a co-conspirator
in the Bluenet case,

24:59.665 --> 25:02.293
but a victim
in the evidence fabrication incident.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.421
Your attitude is proof enough to me
you're born to be a prosecutor.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.382
Next time,
fight for justice as a prosecutor.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.968
It's been rough for you.
You deserve the reward.

25:14.430 --> 25:17.058
No, I don't deserve it.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.984
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
INTERROGATION ROOM

25:27.068 --> 25:29.570
Damn it, that weasel.

25:29.654 --> 25:33.282
How dare he attempt to switch sides
and strike a deal in his favor?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.993
No way.
We have enough evidence without his help.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.580
No, he was the one caught red-handed.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.626
Lee's testimony is crucial
if you want to make

25:43.709 --> 25:45.586
the connection between Myung and Hwang.

25:45.670 --> 25:48.422
You know Rambo's case is in limbo, right?

25:48.506 --> 25:52.343
So, I should take the weasel's dirty deal?

25:52.426 --> 25:54.095
Of course.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.138
You never know
with Special Investigations.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.808
Look, Chairman Myung is arrested.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.768
Hwang's past is now out in the open.

26:00.851 --> 26:03.271
The atmosphere at Prosecution
has changed overnight.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.189
What do we know for sure?

26:05.273 --> 26:06.440
We have the upper hand?

26:07.316 --> 26:08.317
No!

26:08.901 --> 26:11.946
This whole thing
can be overturned overnight.

26:12.029 --> 26:15.533
So, you have to play the trump card

26:15.616 --> 26:17.118
while you have the upper hand.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.578
Geez.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.086
Huh?

26:35.761 --> 26:40.516
JUSTICE TO SOCIETY,
HAPPINESS TO THE PEOPLE

26:43.394 --> 26:45.813
The acquittal awarded by the court today

26:46.397 --> 26:48.149
marks the beginning of a new fight.

26:48.232 --> 26:52.778
We are going to expose the truth
behind this prosecutorial misconduct.

26:52.862 --> 26:57.825
So Mrs. Yoon and I,
we will fight to the end.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.580
Doesn't suit your taste?

27:04.665 --> 27:06.667
No, it's good.

27:08.085 --> 27:11.130
It's been a while
since my daughter made me dinner.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.631
Then, why aren't you eating?

27:15.092 --> 27:18.137
Mom, how about you rest for a bit?

27:18.220 --> 27:21.182
You must be worn out
from spending time inside.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.059
If you go around with Minister Son--

27:23.142 --> 27:24.894
I felt so wronged.

27:27.188 --> 27:30.691
It's unfair that I was imprisoned
for something I didn't do.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.860
The company is in shambles because of me.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.821
My friends have been harassed
because of me.

27:35.905 --> 27:40.493
I was treated like a sinner,
subjected to an insulting investigation.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.833
Still, I withstood it in prayer.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.378
But still,

27:51.712 --> 27:54.298
they accused me of fabricating the ledger.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.259
I really wanted to die.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.680
I'm scared.

28:02.264 --> 28:05.184
I'm so scared to fight again,

28:05.810 --> 28:08.437
but if I don't want someone else
to suffer like I did.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.897
I have to fight back.

28:11.524 --> 28:14.485
No, you just think about you.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.822
You're not even a politician like Mr. Son.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.826
But I'm a prosecutor's mother.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.621
I can't tell you to be
a righteous prosecutor,

28:26.372 --> 28:28.749
and disregard the truth myself.

28:34.088 --> 28:37.258
Don't worry. This isn't enough to faze me.

28:38.801 --> 28:42.054
I'm going to enjoy this meal you cooked
and fight to the end.

28:44.014 --> 28:45.516
Let's eat.

28:55.693 --> 28:57.194
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

29:02.116 --> 29:05.453
THIS PERSON WISHES TO RESIGN
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS…

29:09.039 --> 29:10.249
Miss Park Joon-gyeong.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.293
We're from
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.920
We begin the interrogation

29:15.004 --> 29:17.798
for forgery of private documents,
and the obstruction of justice.

29:17.882 --> 29:20.426
These documents you handed over
to Special Investigations.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.804
Were you the one who forged them?

29:37.943 --> 29:40.404
Prosecutor Park, you may go.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.452
Your mother has passed away.

30:28.702 --> 30:32.706
EVIDENCE COLLECTED

30:32.790 --> 30:35.167
I'm the one who forged…

30:35.960 --> 30:39.171
the bribery document. Forgive me.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.259
I'll take all the blame.

30:53.394 --> 30:54.687
Sorry for the wait.

30:55.729 --> 30:59.441
It's been hectic,
since being promoted to Chief.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.198
I'm sorry I couldn't attend
your mother's funeral.

31:06.782 --> 31:07.783
But…

31:09.410 --> 31:11.620
why did you want to meet here?

31:12.663 --> 31:15.457
I checked the visitors' log
the day my mother died.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.502
Huh?

31:19.211 --> 31:22.089
While I was interrogated
at Supreme Prosecutions,

31:22.172 --> 31:24.341
my mother was also here.

31:24.425 --> 31:25.551
It was you, right?

31:27.511 --> 31:28.846
What did you say to her?

31:30.639 --> 31:33.642
Did you threaten my mom,
while you had me locked in there?

31:33.726 --> 31:34.768
Are you…

31:35.936 --> 31:37.771
interrogating me?

31:39.273 --> 31:41.066
I won't forgive you.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.445
I'm going to fight to the end

31:45.154 --> 31:47.948
to reveal the truth
about your true colors.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.241
What gives you the right?

31:50.993 --> 31:52.077
Park Joon-gyeong.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.247
The charges against you
for evidence fabrication…

31:55.331 --> 31:58.000
We're sweeping it under the rug,
since your mother passed.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.543
You're family to us.

32:00.127 --> 32:03.213
We don't see the point
in investigating someone who's passed.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.673
But, what now?

32:06.091 --> 32:07.301
Reveal what?

32:16.685 --> 32:17.895
I heard you resigned.

32:20.648 --> 32:21.940
Good thinking.

32:23.567 --> 32:27.029
Join a law firm somewhere, and stay quiet.

32:48.384 --> 32:49.635
Hello, Miss Park.

32:51.387 --> 32:52.471
What brings you here?

32:53.305 --> 32:56.517
Oh, I heard you were returning
to Prosecution.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.561
-Is that why you're here?
-I'm here to see you.

33:00.813 --> 33:01.939
Me?

33:02.606 --> 33:06.318
I gave it a lot of thought once I heard
I could return to the Prosecution.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.029
My father died
when I was in middle school.

33:09.113 --> 33:11.573
Since then,
my sole dream was to fight for the weak

33:11.657 --> 33:14.034
and become a righteous prosecutor.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.161
Come back.

33:16.245 --> 33:17.913
If you join us,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.582
I think you'll be of great help
to the investigation.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.840
I wanted to give this to you.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.093
What is this?

33:33.554 --> 33:37.599
A fountain pen?
Is it a recorder of some sort?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.768
Does this have some important transcript?

33:39.852 --> 33:42.604
Yong gave this to me
before he left for Mongolia.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.483
He told me to use this pen to sign papers

33:47.276 --> 33:49.403
incriminating the bad guys.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.742
So, why are you giving this to me?

33:54.825 --> 33:57.536
I'm a co-conspirator
in Hwang's evidence fabrication case.

33:58.245 --> 33:59.997
I can't be a prosecutor anymore.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.293
I wish you the best,
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

34:12.926 --> 34:16.472
What do you do when you have
to be a monster to fight the monsters?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.309
Just now,

34:20.392 --> 34:23.437
a man named Lee Su-dong offered
to do a filthy deal with me.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.439
What do I do in these situations?

34:47.211 --> 34:49.713
Oh, you're home.

34:53.967 --> 34:57.554
Oh, that was an accident.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.649
What kind of man is your father?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.442
Huh?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.444
I mean…

35:13.028 --> 35:15.239
He got greedy over a petty sum,
and now what?

35:17.032 --> 35:19.493
How long is he going to live that way?

35:19.576 --> 35:20.577
Huh?

35:21.829 --> 35:24.540
Until when is he going to live
like a lowlife?

35:25.457 --> 35:26.667
Until when?

35:29.837 --> 35:31.046
Until when?

35:56.446 --> 35:59.741
Do you feel better now?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.968
You didn't have to hurt your hand.

36:22.931 --> 36:23.932
Sorry.

36:30.147 --> 36:33.942
You know why I chose you, right?

36:36.236 --> 36:39.448
We could have bought any house
with my dad's money.

36:40.324 --> 36:41.325
The thing is,

36:42.659 --> 36:46.872
money can't buy
the kind of house I want to live in.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.960
The Blue House.

36:55.464 --> 36:56.673
Your father-in-law

36:57.382 --> 37:00.385
is still someone we need.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.972
The money he made out of greed

37:04.056 --> 37:06.058
is why you've risen so high.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.897
But everyone we bought with money
has betrayed us.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.941
So put them back in their place.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.528
What can we do now?

37:19.446 --> 37:22.866
I told Dad to take care of them himself.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.375
-Himself?
-Yeah.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.294
So you're saying,

37:35.545 --> 37:38.548
the bastard, Oh Chang-hyeon betrayed me

37:39.591 --> 37:42.594
and introduced Eun Yong
to the seniors of the Supreme Office?

37:42.678 --> 37:45.055
-Is that it?
-Yes.

37:53.772 --> 37:54.856
Attorney Shim.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.485
I need to call someone.

37:58.568 --> 38:02.072
Help me make calls at my convenience
for when I return to prison.

38:02.656 --> 38:05.492
I'll speak to the prison ward.

38:06.743 --> 38:07.995
Okay.

38:14.668 --> 38:17.045
Enjoyed your dinner?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.632
Shall we resume the interrogation?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.094
I don't feel well.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.221
Let's call it a day.

38:28.181 --> 38:31.309
You went to the bathroom for three hours.

38:31.393 --> 38:32.853
You took two hours to eat.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.981
I can't let you go just yet.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.442
Let's confirm a few things--

38:39.651 --> 38:41.236
Attorney Shim,

38:41.319 --> 38:43.989
make a call to your friend,
that district prosecutor.

38:44.740 --> 38:47.242
This prosecutor is ignoring
the rights of the suspect

38:47.325 --> 38:49.745
and wants to press on
with the investigation.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.622
Mr. Jang, let's call it a day.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.754
How long do you think
you'll be able to avoid this?

39:01.298 --> 39:04.509
How long do you think I'll stay in here?

39:06.762 --> 39:08.513
As long as your list of sins.

39:13.435 --> 39:16.354
I heard Eun Yong is your uncle.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.899
My, my.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.444
Kid prosecutor,
you may have won the arrest warrant

39:22.527 --> 39:24.404
with your uncle's help.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.699
Better get off your high horse.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.660
The world

39:30.744 --> 39:33.288
isn't as easy as you think.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.211
Lee Su-dong was caught red-handed.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.630
Even the courts

39:41.713 --> 39:43.507
-acknowledge your involvement--
-So…

39:45.175 --> 39:46.885
What did Lee Su-dong say?

39:48.762 --> 39:52.557
Did he testify that I gave him the orders?

39:55.644 --> 39:57.771
Investigate according to your laws.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.565
I'm clean.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.109
I have no problems.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.618
Lee Su-dong suggested a deal to Tae-chun?

40:12.202 --> 40:13.954
He's a lawyer himself,

40:14.037 --> 40:17.541
so he knows his testimony is most critical
to get Myung indicted.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.210
Lee Su-dong…

40:20.293 --> 40:22.462
He is the type of man who can be bought.

40:24.965 --> 40:25.966
Let's wait it out.

40:27.384 --> 40:28.718
Tae-chun has to decide

40:28.802 --> 40:32.139
what kind of prosecutor he wants to be.
That way he makes no regrets.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.601
For how long will you live in regret?

40:37.144 --> 40:39.521
I heard you refused to return
to Prosecution.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.984
I have to be responsible for my actions.

40:46.528 --> 40:48.405
I spoke to the police,

40:48.488 --> 40:51.074
they say Lee Jin-ho disappeared
from the hospital.

40:51.158 --> 40:52.909
I thought he was in the ICU.

40:52.993 --> 40:55.787
He was moved to the general ward,
since his state improved.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.747
I think he took the chance to run.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.251
Can you guess where he is?

41:05.005 --> 41:07.090
If you want to find Jin-ho,

41:07.174 --> 41:09.843
there are drug dealers
among Kim Seong-tae's boys.

41:09.926 --> 41:12.846
If you look there, you'll find something.

41:13.638 --> 41:14.723
Drugs?

41:16.933 --> 41:19.686
Myung and Kim often used that method

41:19.769 --> 41:20.812
to train the boys.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.815
Jin-ho changed due to the drugs.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.778
I should have taken care of him.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.824
You can't take care of everyone.

41:33.575 --> 41:35.744
In the end,
people make their own decision,

41:35.827 --> 41:37.871
and they're held responsible for it.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.331
No.

41:40.248 --> 41:43.418
If Jin-ho had one good person
looking out for him,

41:43.501 --> 41:45.670
he may have turned out different.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.798
Just like how I changed,
thanks to your mother.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.822
Lee's testimony is crucial
if you want to make

42:12.906 --> 42:14.699
the connection between Myung and Hwang.

42:14.783 --> 42:17.535
You know Rambo's case is in limbo, right?

42:17.619 --> 42:21.456
So, I should take the weasel's dirty deal?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.166
Of course.

42:23.250 --> 42:25.252
You never know
with Special Investigations.

42:35.595 --> 42:38.390
I see you're not a prosecutor,
but just a legal professional.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.934
We have the evidence to prove a crime,

42:41.017 --> 42:44.145
but you're looking through the books,
searching for reasons to disprove it.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.647
I can see why Hwang likes you.

43:04.165 --> 43:08.253
So, have you spoken to Mr. Eun?

43:11.339 --> 43:12.674
I'll call him now.

43:14.509 --> 43:15.510
Okay.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.318
Hey, Tae-chun.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.903
Lee Su-dong says that if you visit him,

43:33.987 --> 43:36.239
he'll testify in my favor.

43:37.532 --> 43:40.160
-Really?
-Mr. Eun.

43:40.243 --> 43:41.453
It's Lee Su-dong.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.040
Hey, you know how we do things
around here.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.624
Let's meet in person.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.298
Hey, Uncle.

43:55.175 --> 43:57.469
Don't accept any of Lee Su-dong's offers.

44:03.892 --> 44:06.728
I'm going to keep my promise
to become a prosecutor

44:07.437 --> 44:09.522
who sees this investigation to the end.

44:11.399 --> 44:12.817
Leave it to me from here.

44:15.945 --> 44:18.281
Okay, will do.

44:21.868 --> 44:23.078
UNCLE YONG, CALL ENDED

44:37.050 --> 44:38.635
So you're an idiot?

44:56.653 --> 44:58.655
It's still a relief.

44:59.948 --> 45:02.909
So, Assemblyman Choi's secretary
confessed?

45:03.535 --> 45:04.577
Yeah.

45:06.871 --> 45:09.040
If you handle this well,

45:09.124 --> 45:11.793
you're transferring
to Special Investigations.

45:12.377 --> 45:13.586
Did your father say so?

45:14.671 --> 45:17.715
Last week, he played golf
with the district chief.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.226
Se-hui.

45:30.645 --> 45:33.231
Did you tell your dad
that Assemblyman Choi's secretary

45:33.314 --> 45:34.816
was giving me a headache?

45:37.944 --> 45:40.530
He keeps saying,
he just got into a car accident,

45:40.613 --> 45:44.242
but I've dealt with plenty cases like this
at Criminal Investigations.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.328
He was physically beat up.

45:52.375 --> 45:53.585
It was your father, right?

45:55.628 --> 45:56.921
I asked him to do it.

45:58.047 --> 46:02.051
If you fail this case,
you must tender your resignation, no?

46:05.555 --> 46:07.599
Did you forget the promise you made me

46:09.184 --> 46:10.518
when we got married?

46:23.156 --> 46:25.742
Next time you discuss work with your dad--

46:25.825 --> 46:29.871
Fine, I'll run it by you first.

46:35.585 --> 46:36.628
Chief.

46:40.173 --> 46:43.218
There was a meeting earlier today
at the Supreme Office.

46:44.677 --> 46:46.513
I think the decision was made there.

46:48.223 --> 46:49.224
Of course.

46:51.768 --> 46:52.977
What are you going to do?

46:54.562 --> 46:55.855
What?

46:55.939 --> 46:58.358
Once I'm out,
you're next in Special Investigations.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.070
I'm on your side.

47:04.197 --> 47:06.658
Aren't you sick of being called
the second man?

47:07.534 --> 47:11.037
-Don't you want to be Chief?
-No.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.498
I like being Hwang Gi-seok's second man.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.416
Coming second only to you,

47:16.459 --> 47:18.586
that's higher than
what I can reach on my own.

47:20.588 --> 47:21.839
A lot higher.

47:28.263 --> 47:30.515
-Yeong-jin.
-Yes?

47:33.142 --> 47:35.270
Would you do anything for me?

47:36.396 --> 47:37.730
Yes, I would.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.653
I'm the one in here,

47:44.404 --> 47:47.031
but you don't look well at all.

47:49.367 --> 47:53.162
I won't tell the prosecutor anything,
even if he asks.

47:53.246 --> 47:56.416
-I mean it.
-Oh, no, no.

47:56.499 --> 47:57.625
On the contrary,

47:59.586 --> 48:02.171
I'd like to ask you to file a lawsuit.

48:02.755 --> 48:03.881
What?

48:04.507 --> 48:06.509
You want me to sue you?

48:08.219 --> 48:11.639
Bok-sun, if you sue me…

48:14.225 --> 48:16.686
I'll return your Dongdaemun shares.

48:18.271 --> 48:20.732
A lawsuit will be filed
against my father-in-law

48:20.815 --> 48:22.734
at the Eastern District Prosecution.

48:23.568 --> 48:26.029
The filing will go
to Prosecutor Yang Dong-cheol.

48:28.740 --> 48:32.160
-Your colleague from the academy?
-Yes.

48:32.869 --> 48:34.078
Dong-cheol.

48:35.204 --> 48:37.498
You do know he's dealing
with a sex scandal?

48:37.582 --> 48:39.751
That's why it's easier to make deals.

48:47.842 --> 48:50.803
Sir, about the Myung fraud lawsuit.

48:50.887 --> 48:53.473
Let's issue a summons tonight.

48:53.556 --> 48:54.557
What?

48:54.641 --> 48:59.062
But Chairman Myung is
at the Central District Detention Center.

49:00.271 --> 49:03.232
Exactly, so we can call him whenever.

49:07.153 --> 49:09.781
Also, you don't have to stay
for the night shift.

49:11.074 --> 49:14.160
I'll just get his testimony
and hand it over to Central District.

49:15.745 --> 49:17.455
I can do that on my own.

49:18.873 --> 49:21.042
Inmate 5488, summons by Prosecution.

49:39.727 --> 49:43.731
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
OF HUMANE RESPECT

49:50.947 --> 49:52.740
PROSECUTOR YANG DONG-CHEOL

49:55.535 --> 49:57.412
All right, Mr. Myung In-ju.

49:58.454 --> 50:02.750
Ms. Kim Bok-sun, a Dongdaemun investor,
has filed a lawsuit against you.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.877
Let us begin the interrogation.

50:08.339 --> 50:09.340
One minute.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.802
GMI BANK

51:25.166 --> 51:26.918
You have to be back in three hours.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.337
Don't worry about that.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.548
-I will return this favor soon.
-Honored.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.838
NO CALLER ID

52:26.310 --> 52:28.312
INCOMING CALL
NO CALLER ID

52:31.148 --> 52:32.441
Hello?

52:53.588 --> 52:54.755
I END MY LIFE IN HUMILIATION…

52:54.839 --> 52:56.674
FULL RESPONSIBILITY
AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR…

52:56.757 --> 52:58.926
CONTINUOUS THREATS…

52:59.010 --> 53:01.554
I'VE BEEN IN AFFLICTION…

53:06.851 --> 53:09.896
I gave everything
to taking care of the seniors.

53:10.479 --> 53:12.565
Are you really turning your back on me?

53:13.900 --> 53:16.277
Look at me now.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.280
That doesn't mean you can blackmail me!

53:23.826 --> 53:26.037
That's why I came to see you here.

53:27.121 --> 53:30.124
You know things like this take time.

53:31.709 --> 53:34.962
Once all is settled,
you'll get indictment without detention.

53:35.046 --> 53:37.381
Just wait it out, okay?

53:38.049 --> 53:39.717
I put my trust in you, sir.

53:49.352 --> 53:50.728
SIGNED: OH CHANG-HYEON

54:06.369 --> 54:08.788
GMI BANK

54:11.499 --> 54:12.875
Fine.

54:12.959 --> 54:15.169
Don't be let down too much.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.880
And get rid of those damn pictures.

54:19.006 --> 54:21.467
I understand. Will do.

54:21.550 --> 54:23.344
My goodness.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.225
GMI BANK

54:30.768 --> 54:31.852
What the hell?

54:33.688 --> 54:37.149
I won't say a word about you, sir.

54:42.863 --> 54:44.365
Now,

54:44.448 --> 54:45.574
and forever!

55:01.257 --> 55:03.426
That café makes the best coffee
around here.

55:03.509 --> 55:05.928
-They open early, too.
-Great.

55:06.721 --> 55:09.265
Did Tae-chun mention anything
about Lee Su-dong?

55:09.348 --> 55:10.725
Yeah, he called me yesterday.

55:11.308 --> 55:14.937
He said to refuse,
no matter what the offer.

55:17.148 --> 55:20.109
What do you do when you have
to be a monster to fight the monsters?

55:21.819 --> 55:23.154
Just now,

55:23.237 --> 55:25.990
a man named Lee Su-dong offered
to do a filthy deal with me.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.993
What do I do in these situations?

55:36.417 --> 55:38.210
Being the person I've become now,

55:38.294 --> 55:40.880
I wouldn't hesitate
to become a nastier monster.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.345
I'll keep it in mind,
and the choice you made.

55:49.346 --> 55:50.556
Also,

55:52.058 --> 55:55.019
I'll think about
what made you give me this.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.319
Chose something different, it seems.

56:03.402 --> 56:05.071
Law and order.

56:05.905 --> 56:07.782
Damn you, public officials.

56:08.616 --> 56:10.701
Rightfully so, we're paid in taxes.

56:11.327 --> 56:12.578
Hang on.

56:13.996 --> 56:16.624
Speak of the devil.

56:17.666 --> 56:20.044
Hey, Tae-chun.
Why're you calling so early?

56:20.127 --> 56:21.420
Did you see the news?

56:22.254 --> 56:24.757
-What news?
-CEO Oh just committed suicide.

56:27.551 --> 56:28.677
What?

56:31.597 --> 56:34.975
According to the suicide note
found on Oh's person,

56:35.059 --> 56:39.063
Oh had been continually harassed
by a funds manager called Eun,

56:39.146 --> 56:41.315
concerning GMI Bank's
stock manipulation case.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.399
OH'S SUICIDE NOTE

56:42.483 --> 56:44.985
Eun approached Oh by tempting
to provide campaign funds,

56:45.069 --> 56:48.739
while asking for privileges
to Eun's investment company.

56:48.823 --> 56:51.367
Forcing Oh's participation
in insider trading

56:51.450 --> 56:53.119
and other illegal activities.

56:53.202 --> 56:57.289
The suspect is now wanted
by the Prosecution.

56:57.373 --> 57:02.002
Considered a flight risk,
authorities will soon issue a travel ban.

57:02.086 --> 57:04.255
Recently, Eun's investment company

57:04.338 --> 57:08.050
underwent a high-level examination
by the Financial Supervisory Service.

57:08.134 --> 57:12.221
According to sources, the FSS will look
into suspicions of tax evasion

57:12.304 --> 57:15.224
and violations
of foreign funds management.

57:16.058 --> 57:17.226
SUSPECT ASKED FOR PRIVILEGES

57:17.309 --> 57:19.895
Oh's suicide note makes no sense.

57:19.979 --> 57:23.274
His suicide makes no sense.

57:28.612 --> 57:29.738
Wait.

57:37.288 --> 57:40.291
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

57:41.584 --> 57:43.502
They're moving pretty quickly.

57:43.586 --> 57:44.712
As if according to plan.

57:48.716 --> 57:50.801
Why don't you hide out at my place?

57:50.885 --> 57:52.136
I'll visit your office.

57:53.679 --> 57:54.722
I'll call you.

58:10.196 --> 58:13.073
Yes, we've arrived at the office.

58:13.157 --> 58:14.366
Have you?

58:15.659 --> 58:16.994
I'll leave it to you.

58:22.041 --> 58:24.376
INSPECTION DEPARTMENT
PROSECUTOR NAM JAE-WOOK

58:27.922 --> 58:30.758
All right, stop what you're doing.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.760
We'll be executing this search warrant.

58:47.900 --> 58:49.026
Ms. Hong Han-nah.

58:51.362 --> 58:53.948
Can you contact Eun Yong?

59:13.550 --> 59:15.552
GMI BANK, OH CHANG-HYEON

59:21.267 --> 59:22.643
CEO Oh's death.

59:23.936 --> 59:26.689
It's a stronger move than I imagined.

59:26.772 --> 59:29.650
There's only one way to counter

59:31.402 --> 59:32.778
this unpredictable attack.

1:00:20.659 --> 1:00:22.494
SUSPECT EUN,

1:00:22.578 --> 1:00:25.914
WANTED FOR THREATENING
GMI BANK CEO OH

1:00:42.181 --> 1:00:43.307
Have you lost your mind?

1:00:43.390 --> 1:00:45.726
You're a wanted man.
You shouldn't be here.

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.145
If I hide,

1:00:48.228 --> 1:00:49.355
you'll pay the price.

1:00:52.358 --> 1:00:54.109
There's only one way out.

1:00:55.110 --> 1:00:56.612
Hey, Tae-chun.

1:00:59.365 --> 1:01:00.491
Cuff me…

1:01:01.784 --> 1:01:02.910
with your own hands.

1:01:29.603 --> 1:01:30.813
SUSPECT EUN,

1:01:30.896 --> 1:01:32.815
WANTED FOR THREATENING
GMI BANK CEO OH

1:02:10.018 --> 1:02:11.311
Just let me take care of it.

1:02:11.395 --> 1:02:12.896
I'll wrap it up neatly.

1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:14.731
I'm Hwang Gi-seok.

1:02:14.815 --> 1:02:18.777
Keeping quiet
isn't going to lead you anywhere.

1:02:20.904 --> 1:02:21.905
I know.

1:02:21.989 --> 1:02:24.908
I know that it won't lead me anywhere
even if I tell you the names

1:02:24.992 --> 1:02:27.161
of those who received bribes
and dirty money.

1:02:27.995 --> 1:02:29.246
Welcome.

1:02:29.788 --> 1:02:31.165
So when I leave,

1:02:31.248 --> 1:02:34.084
I'm going to hold
onto your hand and leave!

1:02:34.168 --> 1:02:35.377
OPERATION ROOM

1:02:36.295 --> 1:02:37.796
Get a grip, you fool!

1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:38.964
No deals will be made.

1:02:39.047 --> 1:02:40.257
I will not give up either.

1:02:40.340 --> 1:02:42.009
Can I leave this place now?

1:02:43.177 --> 1:02:44.928
I don't care how much it costs.
