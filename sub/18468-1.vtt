02:01.437 --> 02:03.905
Garçon, where is
the bordelaise sauce?

02:04.073 --> 02:05.404
Right here, sir.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.439
- And some more wine.
- Yes, sir.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.719
Wake up.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.816
Wake up.

02:22.992 --> 02:24.892
What is it, a ship?

02:25.061 --> 02:27.791
No, you was calling me "Garçon."

02:27.964 --> 02:29.625
Who's Garçon?

02:29.799 --> 02:32.597
Doggone you, Sink.
I was just having a wonderful dream.

02:32.769 --> 02:34.600
- What about?
- What do you think?

02:34.771 --> 02:37.262
- Food.
- What, again?

02:37.440 --> 02:40.307
- Yeah, and you had to wake me up.
- I was lonely.

02:40.476 --> 02:43.001
- What day is it?
- Wednesday.

02:43.179 --> 02:46.171
- You said yesterday was Wednesday.
- Then it must be Thursday.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.742
It must be.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.749
So what?

02:51.688 --> 02:53.315
Fifteen days.

02:54.324 --> 02:56.087
Oh, boy, if I ever get out of this...

02:56.259 --> 02:58.819
...my first meal is gonna
be a humdinger.

02:59.662 --> 03:03.621
A big, thick, juicy steak
with baked potatoes.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.200
Asparagus with hollandaise sauce.

03:06.369 --> 03:08.496
And chocolate cake and ice cream.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.310
- That for me?
- No, this is for Seaman Sinkewicz.

03:25.255 --> 03:28.156
This is for you, and you've got
a surprise tonight.

03:28.324 --> 03:29.814
Turkey? Steak?

03:31.895 --> 03:34.796
A lovely raw egg
floating in your milk.

03:44.073 --> 03:46.701
"By America's best cook,
Elizabeth Lane.

03:46.876 --> 03:49.606
Roast goose Bernoise
with walnut dressing...

03:49.779 --> 03:52.077
...giblet gravy, cranberry..."

04:08.765 --> 04:10.562
Did you enjoy your lunch,
honey boy?

04:10.733 --> 04:11.961
You mean that mush?

04:12.135 --> 04:14.899
When a guy's okay,
and he wants some man-size food...

04:15.071 --> 04:16.504
...why do they hold out on him?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.130
You forget you were out on a raft
for 18 days without any food.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.039
Your tummy's not ready
for solid food.

04:22.211 --> 04:24.771
And why is Sinkewicz's stomach
any different than mine?

04:24.948 --> 04:27.314
Because you starved longer
than he did, Jeffy.

04:27.483 --> 04:29.815
You gave him the last
of that K ration, remember?

04:29.986 --> 04:31.476
That was a great sacrifice.

04:31.654 --> 04:32.882
That was no sacrifice.

04:33.056 --> 04:34.421
Have you ever tasted K ration?

04:34.590 --> 04:37.320
If I starved longer, do they
have to try to finish the job?

04:37.493 --> 04:39.358
Of course not,
but the doctors know best.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.190
All I get is milk, milk, milk.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.889
- Every time I yawn, I'm scared I'll moo.
- Silly boy.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.092
I'll get something to read
and be right back.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.635
- Hi, fella.
- Hi, Sinkewicz.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.605
Say, look, you had steak
again yesterday, didn't you?

04:51.774 --> 04:54.072
And today, chicken Maryland.

04:54.243 --> 04:55.540
Oh, brother.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.681
- How do you work it?
- You gotta use the old magoo, Jeff.

04:58.848 --> 05:01.749
That's all. The old magoo.

05:05.955 --> 05:07.889
- The old magoo.
- Here we are.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.490
Your favorite and mine.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.585
Elizabeth Lane.

05:12.762 --> 05:15.526
You know, she must be the most
wonderful cook in America.

05:15.698 --> 05:16.995
Yeah.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.691
I've dreamt about eating
one of her seven-course meals.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.531
She says, "Yesterday, my son
was 8 months old.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.333
He's getting quite companionable.

05:25.508 --> 05:28.102
I sat him in the kitchen with me
while I prepared dinner.

05:28.277 --> 05:31.838
And what a dinner it was. I took
crisp lettuce, romaine and crinkly endive...

05:33.416 --> 05:35.884
...from my own garden
for my husband's favorite salad.

05:36.052 --> 05:39.647
For this I made a rich, creamy
blue cheese dressing.

05:41.224 --> 05:43.317
Then to prepare roast duck
his favorite way...

05:43.493 --> 05:47.156
...I rub salt and pepper inside,
then brown the duck in its own fat..."

05:47.330 --> 05:48.627
Wait. Please.

05:48.798 --> 05:51.028
Would you mind?
I know she's a wonderful woman...

05:51.200 --> 05:53.430
...a marvelous housekeeper
and a great cook...

05:53.603 --> 05:55.833
...but would you mind reading
something else?

05:56.005 --> 05:57.529
Well, of course not.

05:57.707 --> 06:01.473
How about the new Mayfair?
There's a very funny story in it. I'll get it.

06:03.179 --> 06:04.441
Roast duck.

06:07.016 --> 06:08.483
Hey, Sink?

06:10.420 --> 06:11.751
What do you want now?

06:11.921 --> 06:14.583
You're getting to be a problem child.

06:14.891 --> 06:17.724
What is this old magoo you talk
about that gets you the food?

06:17.894 --> 06:19.691
Oh, that?

06:19.862 --> 06:21.727
Now, look, that nurse you got.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.263
- Yeah?
- She likes you.

06:23.433 --> 06:25.196
Well, the magoo.

06:25.368 --> 06:27.893
- What magoo?
- Oh, now, listen.

06:28.071 --> 06:30.869
Don't you think they like to do
those little extra things...

06:31.040 --> 06:33.406
...for a guy who's in love with them?

06:35.511 --> 06:39.072
But it's got to be convincing. That's
where magoo is different from baloney.

06:39.248 --> 06:40.613
Altogether different.

06:40.783 --> 06:43.217
But just how far do you have to go?

06:44.921 --> 06:46.616
How hungry are you?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.957
That far?

06:49.125 --> 06:50.990
Break a girl's heart that way.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.219
Her heart or your stomach.

06:55.031 --> 06:56.430
Hey.

06:58.034 --> 06:59.399
What's my nurse's name?

06:59.569 --> 07:01.161
Mary.

07:03.139 --> 07:04.470
Mary.

07:08.311 --> 07:09.573
Here we are.

07:09.745 --> 07:12.077
Where were you for so long?

07:12.248 --> 07:14.546
I missed you...

07:14.717 --> 07:16.082
...Mary.

07:16.252 --> 07:17.844
Oh, well, how nice.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.547
I mean, well, I didn't even know
you knew my name.

07:21.724 --> 07:23.885
Me? Not know your name?

07:31.067 --> 07:32.830
What you gonna get, steak or chops?

07:33.002 --> 07:34.469
Chops today, steak tomorrow.

07:34.637 --> 07:36.730
- Okay, huh, bud?
- Yeah, okay.

07:36.906 --> 07:39.932
Say, how far did you have to go?

07:40.543 --> 07:41.771
All the way.

07:41.944 --> 07:43.969
- Yeah?
- Yeah. She thinks I wanna marry her.

07:44.147 --> 07:45.409
Nothing else worked.

07:45.581 --> 07:47.378
Oh, well, don't you worry.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.246
Magoo got you in.
Magoo will get you out.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.184
Look what I've got, Jeffy boy.

08:00.129 --> 08:03.098
- Look.
- Oh, gosh, Mary, you're wonderful.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.962
Well, you're powerful sweet yourself,
sugar.

08:06.536 --> 08:09.164
We've got to cut that
in itty-bitty pieces.

08:10.873 --> 08:12.431
There.

08:12.608 --> 08:14.803
What do you want me to do,
jump for it?

08:20.883 --> 08:23.147
- What's the matter, Jeffy?
- It won't go down.

08:23.319 --> 08:26.254
Oh, my goodness, I told you.
The doctors are right.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.754
My, you're so clever.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.466
Little me is feeling mighty blue
tonight, Jeff.

08:40.635 --> 08:41.898
What's the matter?

08:42.071 --> 08:45.131
I heard that you're getting discharged
from the hospital in a week.

08:45.308 --> 08:46.605
Yeah.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.610
Maybe if I could get away,
you and I might be... I mean...

08:50.780 --> 08:52.077
...I could cook for you.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.682
Yeah?

08:54.850 --> 08:59.719
Jeff, marriage and domesticity,
they frighten you, don't they?

08:59.889 --> 09:02.619
- Well, to tell the truth, l...
- No, I know it, I could tell.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.057
You're afraid of being tied down.
After the war, I mean.

09:06.229 --> 09:09.528
Well, you see, Mary,
I've always been sort of a rolling stone.

09:09.699 --> 09:12.429
I was an artist and a painter.
I've never had a home.

09:12.602 --> 09:14.627
I guess I am a little afraid
of the idea of...

09:14.804 --> 09:16.999
oh, but, Jeffy boy,
a home is so wonderful.

09:17.173 --> 09:19.903
Oh, I know it is, but the thing to do,
Mary, is to wait.

09:20.076 --> 09:23.170
After all, who knows?
You may change your mind too.

09:23.346 --> 09:26.110
Silly boy. If you only knew
what a difference...

09:26.282 --> 09:28.307
...a real home would make.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.816
Just to feel you had it
to come back to.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.215
Yeah.

09:32.388 --> 09:33.980
But you've never known a real home.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.351
If you had, you'd feel differently.

09:37.393 --> 09:41.227
You know, I was just thinking,
honey boy, that...

09:41.397 --> 09:43.592
oh, dear.

09:47.637 --> 09:49.730
Not now. He's asleep.

09:49.905 --> 09:52.305
- When are you two getting married?
- Oh, I don't know.

09:52.475 --> 09:55.410
I'm afraid he's backing out.
It's because he's never had a home.

09:55.578 --> 09:58.376
- He doesn't realize.
- Why don't you do something about it?

09:58.547 --> 10:00.071
Well, do what?

10:00.249 --> 10:04.686
Well, if he spent Christmas
in a real homey home, he might...

10:04.854 --> 10:07.186
That's how Sally Jackson
hooked a Marine last year.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.051
Yeah, but whose home?

10:09.225 --> 10:12.217
Everybody I know lives
in a hotel or one room.

10:12.395 --> 10:14.124
You have a problem.

10:22.772 --> 10:25.332
"Alexander Yardley."

10:25.508 --> 10:27.237
Why, of course.

10:34.116 --> 10:38.348
My dear Mr. Yardley...

10:38.521 --> 10:43.424
...I hope you will remember little me.

10:43.592 --> 10:46.618
This is Mary Lee...

10:46.796 --> 10:51.233
...the girl who nursed
your granddaughter...

10:51.400 --> 10:55.029
...back to health from the measles.

10:57.807 --> 10:59.104
Alexander Yardley?

10:59.275 --> 11:02.267
- Yes, this is Mr. Yardley's residence.
- Special delivery.

11:04.213 --> 11:05.646
Thank you.

11:33.042 --> 11:34.339
- Elkins.
- Yes, sir?

11:34.510 --> 11:37.138
- Did my daughter phone?
- Yes, sir. Midnight last night...

11:37.313 --> 11:39.281
...but I thought it best not to waken you.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.508
- When is she getting here?
- She said she and your granddaughters...

11:42.685 --> 11:45.848
...can't get away from Washington.
Her war work is too heavy.

11:46.021 --> 11:47.352
Say anything else?

11:47.523 --> 11:50.515
Just that she'd call you
and wish you a merry Christmas, sir.

11:50.693 --> 11:53.025
Not much of a Christmas
for me all alone.

11:53.195 --> 11:55.891
No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

12:01.704 --> 12:03.262
Good morning, Mr. Yardley.

12:03.439 --> 12:04.963
Good morning.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.371
That Elizabeth Lane feature,
the housewife one...

12:07.543 --> 12:09.204
...runs in Home and Garden?

12:09.378 --> 12:10.709
No, sir. Smart Housekeeping.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.438
Get me, what's-his-name...

12:13.048 --> 12:15.642
...Mr. Beecham,
on the direct wire, the editor.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.308
Yes, Mr. Yardley.

12:23.225 --> 12:26.251
Mr. Beecham at Smart Housekeeping, sir.

12:26.429 --> 12:28.056
This is Alexander Yardley.

12:28.230 --> 12:29.857
Oh, yes. Yes. How are you, sir?

12:30.032 --> 12:31.693
May I wish you a merry Christmas?

12:32.802 --> 12:34.235
Well, thank you, sir.

12:35.604 --> 12:37.595
Yes, Mrs. Lane's feature is...

12:41.944 --> 12:45.311
But... But I'm not sure
I could do that, Mr. Yardley.

12:45.481 --> 12:49.542
Mrs. Lane's farm and her home life are
something we have no right to intrude on...

12:49.718 --> 12:51.447
I only ask two things of my editors.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.020
Print the truth and obey my orders.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.021
I expect Mrs. Lane at 4.

13:06.469 --> 13:08.801
Elizabeth? This is Dudley.

13:08.971 --> 13:12.338
I think I'd better have lunch with you.
It's important.

13:12.508 --> 13:14.999
Well, then I'll come over now
and see you.

13:21.584 --> 13:23.779
From my living room window
as I write...

13:23.953 --> 13:27.047
...I can look out across the broad
front lawns of our farm...

13:27.223 --> 13:30.681
...like a lovely picture postcard
of wintry New England.

13:30.860 --> 13:35.024
In my fireplace, the good cedar logs
are burning and crackling.

13:39.301 --> 13:41.462
I just stopped to go
into my gleaming kitchen...

13:41.637 --> 13:45.630
...to test the crumbly brown goodness
of the toasted veal cutlets in my oven.

13:45.808 --> 13:48.242
Cook these slowly.

13:50.045 --> 13:51.273
Come in.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.938
- Miss Lane?
- Yes.

13:56.685 --> 13:57.913
Thank you very much.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.453
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, miss.

14:22.678 --> 14:24.509
- Felix.
- Hello. Your breakfast.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.580
Felix, you shouldn't.
Not in this weather.

14:26.749 --> 14:30.014
All the way from the restaurant
with no hat or coat. You'll catch cold.

14:30.185 --> 14:32.585
Pishy-poshy.
In Budapest, this was summer.

14:32.755 --> 14:34.848
Anyway, it's just around the corner...

14:35.024 --> 14:38.858
...and anyway, if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't got no restaurant.

14:39.028 --> 14:41.087
Oh, you paid that back long ago.

14:41.263 --> 14:43.288
This is interest. I'm...

14:43.465 --> 14:45.228
Gee, I knew it.

14:45.401 --> 14:47.631
Such breakfast. Sardines.

14:49.872 --> 14:52.033
You mad at your stomach, darling?

14:52.207 --> 14:53.868
Come here and let me see.

14:54.043 --> 14:55.635
Oh, yummy. Mushroom omelet.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.371
Did you write up those recipes
for next month's article?

14:58.547 --> 14:59.809
- Yes.
- What am I cooking?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.472
Look here.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.778
Breast of gray dove,
sauté with peaches grenadine...

15:04.954 --> 15:08.583
...no points, chicken soup
with Moselle wine, no points.

15:08.757 --> 15:10.691
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- And you can...

15:10.859 --> 15:12.258
Lizk!

15:12.428 --> 15:15.522
- What's the matter?
- That coat! What's the meaning?

15:15.698 --> 15:17.461
Don't worry. I'm paying for it myself.

15:17.633 --> 15:19.726
It'll take my next six months' salary.

15:19.902 --> 15:21.130
Nice, isn't it?

15:21.303 --> 15:22.793
Six months' work for a coat?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.266
All my life, I promised
myself a mink coat.

15:26.442 --> 15:30.276
You know, Felix, it's very important
to keep promises, especially to yourself.

15:30.446 --> 15:33.279
- Do you have to promise so expensively?
- But I needed it.

15:33.449 --> 15:36.350
You need it? Nobody needs
a mink coat but a mink.

15:37.086 --> 15:40.055
You don't know what a mink coat
does for a girl's morale.

15:40.222 --> 15:41.450
Yes, the morale, I know.

15:41.624 --> 15:44.115
I had a silk hat once in Budapest.

15:44.293 --> 15:46.557
A silk hat. It made me feel so fine.

15:46.729 --> 15:50.927
And then I insulted the maitre d'hôtel
and got fired with a silk hat.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.328
Come on, eat.

15:52.501 --> 15:55.163
Mink outside, sardines inside,
that's no good too.

15:55.337 --> 15:56.634
Oh, this is marvelous.

15:56.805 --> 15:59.205
You know, Felix, some time
I'm gonna take time out...

15:59.375 --> 16:01.707
...and learn to cook like you do.
- No, no, no, no.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.139
- No?
- No, no, darling.

16:03.312 --> 16:06.475
Then you would find out
it is not the way you write now.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.310
All easy and fun and...

16:08.484 --> 16:11.009
- Don't cook.
- All right.

16:11.787 --> 16:13.448
I have to go, darling. Goodbye.

16:13.789 --> 16:15.279
Thanks a million.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.125
- Oh, hello, Felix.
- Hello. Goodbye. Merry Christmas.

16:19.294 --> 16:20.522
Don't mention it.

16:20.696 --> 16:22.561
- Hello, Dud.
- Hello, Liz. We're in a jam.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.494
Something terrible is about to happen.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.760
- What?
- Yardley wants to see you right away...

16:26.935 --> 16:28.300
...at his home on Long Island.

16:28.470 --> 16:31.962
Maybe he wants to give me a raise
for Christmas. I've helped circulation.

16:32.141 --> 16:35.042
- No. It's not a raise.
- You look frazzled. You want a drink?

16:35.210 --> 16:38.805
No. No, thanks. Now, it's really nothing
to be nervous about. Not a thing.

16:38.981 --> 16:41.347
Don't be silly.
I'm not nervous. I feel fine.

16:41.517 --> 16:44.042
Well, you won't in a minute.

16:44.219 --> 16:46.619
Now get this. Some fool nurse
at a Naval hospital...

16:46.789 --> 16:50.885
...wrote to Yardley asking him to invite a
wounded sailor to your farm for Christmas.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.288
My farm?

16:52.461 --> 16:54.122
Oh, oh, yes, my farm.

16:54.296 --> 16:55.524
Oh, my farm.

16:55.698 --> 16:57.598
And he wants to see you
to arrange it.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.961
Are you crazy?
Where am I going to get a farm?

17:00.135 --> 17:03.104
- I haven't even got a window box.
- We'll have to stall him off.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.297
You know what a stickler he is
for the truth.

17:05.473 --> 17:09.501
If he ever finds out we've been making
all this up, he'll fire the both of us.

17:14.383 --> 17:17.840
Well, it's been nice knowing you.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.515
It's really not as bad as it sounds, Liz.

17:22.691 --> 17:26.718
All you have to do is to go out there and tell
him that your child has whooping cough.

17:26.895 --> 17:29.830
Say that you couldn't possibly
entertain anyone for Christmas.

17:29.998 --> 17:33.297
- Your husband wouldn't like it.
- Oh, yes. Yes, my husband.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.699
Of course, simplest thing in the world.

17:35.871 --> 17:38.738
You go out and tell him.
You're a much better liar than I am.

17:38.907 --> 17:41.375
Oh, no, Liz. He wants to see you.

17:41.543 --> 17:44.239
And when Yardley wants something,
he gets it or else.

17:44.413 --> 17:46.813
I'd rather get fired
than face that old battle ax.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.973
Yes, but what about me?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.312
Remember, I have a wife
and a family to support.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.513
You're not gonna let me down
after all I've done for you?

17:54.690 --> 17:56.851
Oh, all right. I'll go.

17:57.025 --> 18:00.392
Let's see, whooping cough
or maybe scarlet fever.

18:00.562 --> 18:03.963
- It's a better color for Christmas.
- Anything. Only call off the sailor.

18:04.133 --> 18:07.899
Now if you put this over,
I'll get a raise for you. I swear I will.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.265
The things a girl will do for a mink coat.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.203
Come in.

18:13.375 --> 18:15.741
- Well, here I am.
- Hello, John.

18:15.911 --> 18:18.243
An hour early,
but the early bird catches the worm.

18:18.413 --> 18:20.244
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

18:20.415 --> 18:21.643
Why are you so early?

18:21.817 --> 18:24.411
I took an earlier train.
That much longer to be with you.

18:24.586 --> 18:26.247
Sloan, go away. We're in conference.

18:26.421 --> 18:28.582
Don't mind Dud today.
We're in a little trouble.

18:28.757 --> 18:30.554
If there's anything I can do for you...

18:30.726 --> 18:33.058
...just say the word.
You know how I feel.

18:33.228 --> 18:34.559
No. How do you feel?

18:34.730 --> 18:36.755
Tell us all about it. Say "ah."

18:37.299 --> 18:38.527
Say, what is this?

18:38.700 --> 18:41.931
Go and build those rabbit hutches
or whatever it is you build.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.401
Multiple dwellings.

18:43.572 --> 18:45.699
And I don't build them. I'm an architect.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.843
Go and be it, then. All you want
to do is to propose to Liz again.

18:49.011 --> 18:51.912
- I'll do it for you and get a no for you.
- Now, look here, Liz.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.538
Don't waste time. You have to decide
what you're gonna say to the old man.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.014
- What old man?
- It's Yardley.

18:57.186 --> 19:00.280
- He's sending me a sailor for Christmas.
- Oh, how nice.

19:00.455 --> 19:02.116
A sailor? Really, Elizabeth.

19:02.291 --> 19:05.522
It's just a little trouble we're in.
Yardley thinks I have a farm...

19:05.694 --> 19:09.391
...a husband and a baby in Connecticut.
- A farm, a husband and a baby.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.896
Simple, isn't it?

19:11.066 --> 19:13.466
Well, there's obviously only one thing
for you to do.

19:13.635 --> 19:14.863
Sloan, keep out of this.

19:15.037 --> 19:17.267
I've taken as much
as I'm going to take from you.

19:17.439 --> 19:19.304
Boys, please, stop quarreling.

19:19.474 --> 19:20.839
Come in.

19:21.009 --> 19:23.500
- Mrs. Lane?
- Oh, yes. Put it in there.

19:23.679 --> 19:27.012
Oh, Dud, I wish you'd tell the office
to stop sending those things here.

19:29.985 --> 19:31.475
- Another rocking chair?
- Yes.

19:31.653 --> 19:34.850
- You already have eight.
- Thirty-eight. The rest are in the basement.

19:35.023 --> 19:36.320
Thirty-eight rocking chairs?

19:36.491 --> 19:39.722
I said last month I was searching
in vain through antique shops...

19:39.895 --> 19:43.626
...for a rocking chair like Granny had.
My public is sending me rocking chairs.

19:43.799 --> 19:45.699
And that proves how popular you are.

19:45.868 --> 19:49.565
If you get fired, you'll rob the public
of the finest human-interest feature...

19:49.738 --> 19:52.707
...in the magazine field.
- And Dudley Beecham of his finest job.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.467
All right. Let's get down to cases.

19:54.643 --> 19:56.770
What are you going to say
to the old gentleman?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.175
Well, I'll simply say,
"of course, Mr. Yardley...

19:59.348 --> 20:01.908
...there's nothing I'd rather do
than invite this man..."

20:02.084 --> 20:03.847
- to spend Christmas on my farm but...

20:04.019 --> 20:08.080
Excellent. I knew you'd feel that way.
After all, it's our patriotic duty, isn't it?

20:08.257 --> 20:10.987
The poor young man spent
18 days on a raft...

20:11.159 --> 20:13.855
...six weeks in a hospital,
and he's never had a real home.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.792
You can imagine how much
it'll mean...

20:15.964 --> 20:18.558
...to have a homey Christmas
with your wonderful cooking.

20:18.734 --> 20:20.361
Naturally, but you see...

20:20.702 --> 20:23.796
But your cooking, Mrs. Lane.
I follow your diary faithfully.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.497
It is the only thing I ever
do read in my publications.

20:26.675 --> 20:28.233
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

20:28.410 --> 20:32.039
In october, when you had
breast of guinea hen in Madeira...

20:32.214 --> 20:35.479
...that was perfection, Mrs. Lane.
Lucky man, your husband.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.141
- Thank you...
- And last June's...

20:37.319 --> 20:39.549
...strawberries Chantilly
with rum and egg white.

20:39.721 --> 20:41.848
You stiffen the egg white first
before the rum?

20:42.024 --> 20:44.925
- Definitely, of course.
- Of course. It's the only way to do it.

20:45.093 --> 20:48.494
And your Christmas menu, Mrs. Lane,
that is really magnificent.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.791
Roast goose Bernoise
with walnut stuffing...

20:50.966 --> 20:53.560
...celery soufflé
and real old-fashioned plum pudding.

20:53.735 --> 20:56.568
- It's out of...
- Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

20:56.738 --> 20:59.866
Miss Scott, take this telegram
to Miss Mary Lee...

21:00.042 --> 21:01.873
...Navy Hospital, Staten Island.

21:02.044 --> 21:04.012
In reply to your letter of the 15th...

21:04.179 --> 21:07.080
...Mrs. Lane will be very pleased
to entertain your friend...

21:07.249 --> 21:08.477
...Jefferson Jones.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.845
Mr. Yardley, there's something
you should know.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.010
Yes. What is it?

21:13.188 --> 21:16.055
Well, it was just something
that you should know.

21:16.224 --> 21:19.022
It's my child, he's been ill
with whooping cough.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.389
Whooping cough.
That's not contagious to adults.

21:21.563 --> 21:23.963
My grandchild had it.
Not at all serious nowadays.

21:24.132 --> 21:26.396
- Mr. Yardley...
- This will be a great story...

21:26.568 --> 21:31.005
...for our next issue, Mrs. Lane. "American
Hero Spends Christmas on Perfect Farm."

21:31.173 --> 21:33.539
What a boost for circulation. Yes, indeed.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.702
I believe I'll arrange a nice little bonus
for you, in recognition of your cooperation.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.211
Thank you very much,
but I really couldn't...

21:40.382 --> 21:43.317
Now, now, I know you're not doing this
for any mercenary reason.

21:43.485 --> 21:47.216
You're a fine American wife and mother,
and we're proud to have you on our staff.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.449
- You could use a little bonus, couldn't you?
- Oh, I guess I could.

21:50.625 --> 21:53.355
Splendid. Splendid. Allow me
to shake your hand, Mrs. Lane.

21:53.528 --> 21:55.553
I don't know how to tell you this, but...

21:55.731 --> 21:59.132
Don't try, my dear. And thank you
very much for coming to see me.

21:59.301 --> 22:02.270
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Lane.
- Good afternoon.

22:10.445 --> 22:13.778
- Anything wrong, madam?
- Oh, no, nothing at all.

22:13.949 --> 22:17.146
He's kind of overpowering, isn't he?

22:17.319 --> 22:19.082
Oh, yes. A very strong personality.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.085
- Yes.
- Pardon me, Mrs. Lane...

22:21.256 --> 22:24.657
...but I'm planning on having a farm
in Connecticut myself one day.

22:24.826 --> 22:26.760
I'd like some good bottomland.

22:27.329 --> 22:29.160
- Bottomland?
- Yes.

22:29.331 --> 22:31.595
That's the best kind for farming,
isn't it?

22:31.767 --> 22:34.531
Oh, some people say yes,
and some people say no.

22:34.703 --> 22:36.534
But what do you say?

22:36.705 --> 22:39.139
I'm inclined to agree with them.

22:39.307 --> 22:41.673
Oh, thank you very much.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.606
- What's this?
- It's the menu for your Christmas dinner, sir.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.252
- It's what the doctor ordered.
- "Mashed prune whip.

22:51.420 --> 22:52.682
Creamed turnip fluff."

22:52.854 --> 22:55.448
He expects me to eat
these barbaric atrocities?

22:55.624 --> 22:56.852
Well, I won't.

23:00.062 --> 23:01.290
Mrs. Lane.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.021
There's something I want to...

23:03.198 --> 23:06.224
This must be telepathy.
I know exactly what you're going to say.

23:06.401 --> 23:07.629
- Do you?
- Yes.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.771
You're inviting me
to your Christmas party.

23:09.938 --> 23:12.998
Well, Mrs. Lane, I'm going to accept
with the greatest of pleasure.

23:13.175 --> 23:14.608
Well, that'd be just wonderful.

23:14.776 --> 23:17.973
I'll be there Christmas Eve.
I was going to be with my family...

23:18.146 --> 23:19.704
...but I'm coming to Connecticut.

23:19.881 --> 23:22.679
Well, why not bring the family too?

24:02.057 --> 24:04.025
Where was Elizabeth when she phoned?

24:04.192 --> 24:05.625
Grand Central Station.

24:05.794 --> 24:07.261
Well, she should be here by now.

24:07.429 --> 24:09.863
I sent her to Yardley to talk him out of it.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.056
Instead, he talks her into it.

24:12.234 --> 24:15.328
- It means she'll lose her job, of course.
- Yeah.

24:15.504 --> 24:17.369
And mine too.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.905
Well, merry Christmas.

24:25.313 --> 24:28.077
Hello, Lizka. Your friends are waiting
in the bar.

24:28.250 --> 24:32.209
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Oh, no, no. Just a catastrophe, that's all.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.911
Catastrophe.

24:34.089 --> 24:35.351
- Sam?
- Yes, sir?

24:35.524 --> 24:37.253
Catastrophe, what is it?

24:37.425 --> 24:42.158
It's from the Greek. It means "a misfortune,
a cataclysm or a serious calamity."

24:42.330 --> 24:44.821
Greek, serious, calamity.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.468
- It is good?
- No, sir. That's bad.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.067
Bad?

24:51.373 --> 24:53.807
- A double martini, oscar, please.
- Well?

24:53.975 --> 24:57.172
Every time I opened my mouth, he talked.
I felt like Charlie McCarthy!

24:57.345 --> 24:59.472
Lizka. This catastrophe. It's trouble?

24:59.648 --> 25:02.742
- Yes. I'm going to lose my job, Felix.
- Pish-posh. That's nothing.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.818
- Get another job.
- That's what you think.

25:04.986 --> 25:07.546
I better go phone my wife
and give her the glad tidings.

25:07.722 --> 25:09.417
Darling, you have to eat something.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.719
- Right, you must keep up your strength.
- Commence with an appetizer.

25:12.894 --> 25:14.885
Then I bring some nice
chicken Budapest...

25:15.063 --> 25:18.157
...some Brussels sprouts à la Felix,
some potatoes au gratin.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.858
- Sounds very palatable.
- Help yourself, darling.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.333
First, some nice filet of marinated herring
à la crême.

25:24.506 --> 25:26.838
- Elizabeth?
- Artichoke hearts vinaigrette.

25:27.008 --> 25:28.976
Sometimes these things
happen for the best.

25:29.144 --> 25:31.009
- Bologna.
- But I think how I've worked...

25:31.179 --> 25:32.407
...building up that job.

25:32.581 --> 25:34.310
There's another job waiting for you.

25:34.482 --> 25:35.710
- There is?
- Yes.

25:35.884 --> 25:37.977
The job of being Mrs. John Sloan, darling.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.848
Horseradish.

25:40.021 --> 25:41.488
Well, that's sweet of you, John.

25:41.656 --> 25:44.489
But I don't feel that way about you,
and it wouldn't be fair.

25:44.659 --> 25:47.924
Well, I'm willing to take a chance.
I can make you care for me in time.

25:48.096 --> 25:51.930
Nuts.
Wa... Walnuts, pickled walnuts. Excellent.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.796
Come on, Lizka. Sit here.
I wait on you myself.

25:55.704 --> 25:56.966
Eat everything, Lizka.

25:57.138 --> 26:00.938
Felix, bring us some wine, will you?
Something very good but not too expensive.

26:01.109 --> 26:02.906
Moselle 1927? Yes?

26:03.078 --> 26:04.340
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

26:04.512 --> 26:06.377
Well, Elizabeth, how about it?

26:06.548 --> 26:08.709
You know you need someone
to look after you.

26:08.883 --> 26:10.646
But I don't love you, John.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.343
All that will come in good time.

26:13.221 --> 26:14.848
Could you wait that long?

26:16.057 --> 26:17.422
I think so.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.762
Saying no to your proposals
has become a habit.

26:21.930 --> 26:24.728
Yes, it's a bad habit.
You must break yourself of it.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.435
It becomes harder and harder
to find an excuse to say no.

26:28.603 --> 26:31.970
You can't blame it on your career
this time, because you haven't got one.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.301
You're right.

26:34.476 --> 26:38.105
Well, I just can't think
of another excuse.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.771
You could say that you love
someone else.

26:41.983 --> 26:43.211
But I don't.

26:43.385 --> 26:45.683
No. Let me think.

26:47.656 --> 26:49.021
Oh, what am l...?

26:49.190 --> 26:51.249
You mean...?
You mean you will marry me?

26:51.426 --> 26:54.395
Well, if you really want me,
knowing how I feel.

26:54.562 --> 26:55.961
Do I? Darling.

26:56.131 --> 26:58.122
Well, don't mind me.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.824
Dud, we're going to be married.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.229
What?

27:01.403 --> 27:03.268
Hey, now look here, it isn't that bad.

27:03.438 --> 27:05.497
- Oh, really, Beecham.
- It's a good idea, Dud.

27:05.674 --> 27:08.643
In fact, I think I'll rather enjoy
living on a farm after...

27:08.810 --> 27:11.506
- A farm?
- John's farm. It's in Connecticut.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.705
That's where I got most of my copy.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.281
Say, that's right.

27:15.450 --> 27:17.850
You have got a farm, haven't you?
Congratulate me.

27:18.019 --> 27:20.715
- This is the happiest day.
- Aren't you getting a bit mixed?

27:20.889 --> 27:23.790
- It's the happiest day of my life.
- Of course. Congratulations.

27:23.958 --> 27:26.051
I think you've made
a very wise decision.

27:26.227 --> 27:29.025
In fact, I think you two should
get very married right away.

27:29.197 --> 27:31.563
And there we are.
A husband, a farm in Connecticut.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.133
- Now all we need is a baby.
- What are you getting at?

27:34.302 --> 27:37.703
What's the harm of having Yardley
and a sailor at your farm for Christmas?

27:37.872 --> 27:40.363
Yardley and a sailor on my honeymoon?
Are you crazy?

27:40.542 --> 27:43.272
Elizabeth, I just talked with my wife.

27:43.445 --> 27:45.140
You told her?

27:45.313 --> 27:46.905
I didn't have the heart.

27:47.248 --> 27:50.479
She told me what she was getting
the kids for Christmas.

27:50.652 --> 27:52.119
And, well, l...

27:52.287 --> 27:54.983
She sounded so happy...

27:55.156 --> 27:58.717
of course, I know it's asking a lot,
but when a pal's in a jam...

27:59.327 --> 28:02.057
John, darling, it would
only be for a few days.

28:02.230 --> 28:04.198
After all, Dud's been so good to me.

28:04.366 --> 28:07.164
I am getting out of it now,
thanks to you.

28:08.169 --> 28:11.263
Oh, John, couldn't we
so he won't lose his job?

28:11.840 --> 28:15.503
I know I shall regret this for the rest
of my life, but if it's what you want...

28:15.677 --> 28:17.338
oh, Johnny, you're a lamb.

28:17.512 --> 28:18.877
Sloan, I take everything back.

28:19.047 --> 28:21.880
I'll never forgot this.
I thank you, and my family thanks you.

28:22.050 --> 28:23.415
Wait a minute. It's no good.

28:23.585 --> 28:25.018
- Why not?
- I can't cook.

28:25.186 --> 28:27.950
- She can't cook.
- She can't cook.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.115
Felix. You'll take him with you.
He'll do anything for you.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.487
- Felix.
- Yes, Mr. Beecham.

28:33.661 --> 28:35.128
Felix, I've great news for you.

28:35.296 --> 28:39.562
May I announce to you the engagement
of our dear Elizabeth to Mr. John Sloan?

28:39.734 --> 28:41.929
- A prince of good fellows.
- Thank you.

28:42.103 --> 28:43.866
Lizka, it's true?

28:44.038 --> 28:46.097
Yes, Felix. I decided quite suddenly.

28:46.274 --> 28:48.504
Congratulate them, Felix. It's colossal.

28:48.676 --> 28:49.973
Colossal?

28:50.145 --> 28:52.238
It's catastrophe.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.397
Oh, Mr. Sloan, a merry Christmas.

29:14.569 --> 29:15.900
The same to you, Miss Lane.

29:16.070 --> 29:18.265
Thank you, Nora.
Merry Christmas to you too.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.739
So he finally talked you into marrying him.
Congratulations, Mr. Sloan.

29:21.910 --> 29:23.844
Thank you.
Has Judge Crothers arrived yet?

29:24.012 --> 29:25.980
No, sir. But he's on his way.
He phoned.

29:26.147 --> 29:27.774
That'll be a dollar even.

29:27.949 --> 29:30.713
There you are. And that's for you.

29:32.954 --> 29:34.615
Well, shall I carry you in, darling?

29:34.789 --> 29:36.723
No, thank you. We're not married yet.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.690
Oh, oh, John, it looks lovely.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.458
Just the way I described it
in the Christmas issue.

29:45.633 --> 29:48.397
I'm glad you like it.
Oh, Nora, this is Felix Bassenak.

29:48.570 --> 29:51.698
- He's going to help you with the cooking.
- Help me? Help me?

29:51.873 --> 29:54.273
We're having two guests.
They'll be arriving later.

29:54.442 --> 29:58.208
- I hope you have their rooms ready.
- Everything's ready, Mr. Sloan.

29:58.379 --> 30:02.372
If you come this way, I'll show you
the kitchen, Mr. Basternook.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.243
Just call me Felix.

30:05.954 --> 30:08.149
I hope you like it here, Felix.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.055
Me? I don't like the country.

30:11.793 --> 30:13.283
Oh, it's real cozy here.

30:13.461 --> 30:14.723
We have a horse and a cow.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.990
I hate horses, and cows
don't like me either.

30:18.166 --> 30:19.531
Where's the kitchen?

30:25.640 --> 30:27.335
Why, darling, you look wonderful.

30:27.509 --> 30:30.239
But won't they think
that outfit's a little ultra...

30:30.411 --> 30:32.174
...for Elizabeth Lane, the housewife?

30:32.347 --> 30:33.746
I'll change before they come.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.611
After all, a girl has to be dressed up
on her wedding day.

30:36.784 --> 30:38.479
Do you really...?

30:39.087 --> 30:41.885
- What's the matter?
- What'll I say to Yardley and the sailor?

30:42.056 --> 30:43.284
- About what?
- The baby.

30:43.458 --> 30:46.916
The one I wrote about. They'll expect
to see him. We forgot about the baby.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.563
You forgot about the baby, you mean.
Come with me.

30:49.731 --> 30:52.723
- But, John...
- lf there's one thing an architect thinks of...

30:52.901 --> 30:55.529
...it's details. I told you
I'd attend to everything.

30:55.703 --> 30:57.967
- But, John...
- Come along.

30:59.807 --> 31:01.832
There's your baby.

31:04.479 --> 31:06.208
Oh, John.

31:06.381 --> 31:07.609
Where did you get it?

31:07.782 --> 31:10.046
Nora looks after him
for a neighbor, Mrs. Wright.

31:10.218 --> 31:13.483
She works in a war plant in the village,
and her husband's in the Army.

31:13.655 --> 31:15.646
The baby stays here
quite late each night.

31:15.823 --> 31:20.226
Hello. You're awfully cute.

31:20.395 --> 31:23.125
Oh, John, this is wonderful.
I was worried.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.528
Didn't I tell you that
all your worries are over?

31:25.700 --> 31:27.258
Yes, I guess they are, all right.

31:27.435 --> 31:29.596
You're very sweet to me, John.

31:35.043 --> 31:37.068
Yes, I always think of details.

31:37.245 --> 31:40.271
I was designing a house
once for plumbing.

31:40.448 --> 31:43.815
Instead of ordinary pipes,
they had to be double-ribbed ones.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.213
It's nothing, I just...

31:45.386 --> 31:46.717
- John, dear,
- Yes, darling.

31:46.888 --> 31:50.756
When you're kissing me,
don't talk about plumbing.

31:50.925 --> 31:53.291
What? Oh, sorry. Of course not.

31:53.461 --> 31:55.326
Well, what shall I talk about?

31:55.496 --> 31:58.260
Well, do you...? Do you have to talk?

31:58.433 --> 32:00.025
You quaint little thing.

32:01.736 --> 32:04.728
Mr. Sloan, Judge Crothers is here.
I put him in the den.

32:04.906 --> 32:07.033
Oh, thanks, Nora. Well, darling.

32:14.382 --> 32:17.579
- Anything wrong, darling?
- No, no, nothing at all.

32:20.288 --> 32:23.280
I think I'll freshen up a bit first.

32:23.458 --> 32:26.484
- Oh, certainly, but don't be too long.
- No, I won't.

32:28.396 --> 32:30.091
John, don't you think we...?

32:30.765 --> 32:32.096
Don't I think what, dear?

32:33.901 --> 32:35.198
Nothing.

32:41.676 --> 32:42.904
Judge.

32:43.077 --> 32:44.476
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

32:44.646 --> 32:45.943
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:46.114 --> 32:48.514
- Where is the little bride?
- She'll be right down.

32:48.683 --> 32:52.551
- I thought we'd hold the ceremony in here.
- My, my. A lovely room for a wedding.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.120
How about right here by the mantel
for the ceremony?

32:55.289 --> 32:56.756
The mantel. Splendid idea.

32:56.924 --> 33:00.655
Now, suppose you stand right over here,
judge. That's right. Just like that.

33:00.828 --> 33:02.318
Oh, no, Sloan, not there.

33:02.497 --> 33:03.794
I came here to marry you...

33:03.965 --> 33:06.195
...not to be roasted
for your Christmas dinner.

33:18.046 --> 33:20.606
- Catastrophe.
- What do you mean, "catastrophe"?

33:20.782 --> 33:22.647
"Catastrophe" is a word from the Greeks.

33:22.817 --> 33:24.182
It means "not good."

33:24.352 --> 33:28.652
I'll have you understand this is the finest
kitchen in Connecticut, Mr. Basilknocker.

33:28.823 --> 33:31.257
Just call me Felix. But what smells?

33:31.426 --> 33:32.723
That's Irish stew.

33:32.894 --> 33:36.455
Goulash with turnips! Catastrophe.

33:36.631 --> 33:38.792
It isn't goulash. It's good old Irish stew.

33:38.966 --> 33:41.127
Maybe old, but not good,
such goulash.

33:41.302 --> 33:43.600
I tell you, it isn't goulash.

33:44.338 --> 33:45.703
Hold this.

33:48.476 --> 33:51.070
Paprika. That will fix it.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.414
Now it's goulash.

33:59.587 --> 34:02.021
Nora and Felix, we're gonna need you
as witnesses.

34:02.190 --> 34:05.159
Merciful heavens, the wedding, is it?
I better take off me apron.

34:05.326 --> 34:07.157
- How do I look?
- How do you look?

34:07.328 --> 34:08.955
Is it you that's getting married?

34:09.130 --> 34:11.030
I wish.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.598
Here she is, judge.

34:12.766 --> 34:15.395
- Elizabeth, this is Judge Crothers.
- How do you do?

34:15.570 --> 34:17.231
Oh, it's not me. It's her.

34:17.405 --> 34:19.668
- I'm Nora.
- Oh, you're...

34:19.841 --> 34:22.810
I declare. Well, I'm delighted
to meet you, my dear.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.002
John's very lucky
to get such a lovely bride.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.771
Thank you. This is my uncle Felix.

34:26.947 --> 34:29.143
- How are you?
- Not good.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.717
I suppose you'll give the bride away,
Uncle Felix?

34:31.886 --> 34:34.217
Me? I don't give nobody away.

34:34.388 --> 34:37.016
Always, I keep my mouth shut.

34:38.192 --> 34:39.420
Mouth shut, yes.

34:39.594 --> 34:41.391
If you'll kindly step this way, please.

34:47.467 --> 34:49.299
Join hands, please.

34:50.071 --> 34:52.766
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together in the sight...

34:52.940 --> 34:54.840
Wait, wait a minute. Excuse me, please.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.873
A wedding with no music?

34:57.043 --> 34:58.341
That's impossible.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.344
You're quite right.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.642
I have here a record
of the "Wedding March"...

35:02.817 --> 35:04.409
...especially for the occasion.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.854
Remember, dear? Details?

35:08.022 --> 35:10.149
But, John, couldn't we
have Mozart or...?

35:10.324 --> 35:11.621
No, no, no, darling, no.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.853
The "Wedding March"
is the conventional thing.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.327
Proceed, judge.

35:17.498 --> 35:19.432
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together...

35:19.600 --> 35:21.124
It's company already!

35:21.302 --> 35:23.930
Oh, it's the sailor.
He's two hours early. What'll we do?

35:24.105 --> 35:26.266
- What's the trouble?
- It's a peculiar situation.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.965
- We'll have to postpone.
- Take him to the other room.

35:29.143 --> 35:31.407
- Not in there. You'll wake up the baby.
- The baby?

35:31.579 --> 35:34.446
Well, it's borrowed. I mean, it's adopted.
Oh, go ahead.

35:34.615 --> 35:37.778
Nora, turn off the music
and don't forget to call me Mrs. Sloan.

35:37.952 --> 35:39.317
What, already?

35:40.054 --> 35:41.487
Quartermaster Jones reporting.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.486
Merry Christmas, Mr. Jones.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.488
Your mother invited me, Elizabeth Lane.

35:49.664 --> 35:50.926
No, I'm Elizabeth Lane.

35:51.098 --> 35:53.726
It's my pen name. I'm really Mrs. Sloan.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.630
Won't you come it?

35:56.737 --> 35:58.068
Merry Christmas.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.763
This is my uncle Felix.

35:59.941 --> 36:01.772
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

36:01.943 --> 36:04.537
I'm sorry, l... I guess I didn't expect...

36:04.712 --> 36:06.680
I mean, I thought you were...

36:07.415 --> 36:09.747
oh, I brought a present for you.

36:09.917 --> 36:13.080
- That'll be a dollar even, commander.
- Okay.

36:16.457 --> 36:18.948
Gee, thanks. Merry Christmas.

36:19.126 --> 36:20.491
Merry Christmas.

36:23.331 --> 36:25.026
Well...

36:28.402 --> 36:33.533
l... I guess I pictured you...

36:33.708 --> 36:36.074
oh, older? Yes, everyone does.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.268
It's lovely, isn't it, Uncle Felix?

36:39.447 --> 36:41.915
Wonderful. Just what you need.

36:42.083 --> 36:43.345
I read in your column...

36:43.517 --> 36:45.917
...where you were trying to buy one
and couldn't...

36:46.087 --> 36:48.078
...so I hope you like it.

36:48.689 --> 36:50.020
Of course I do.

36:50.191 --> 36:52.819
My old man was an expert
with rocking chairs.

36:52.994 --> 36:56.293
He said he used to solve
all his problems in one.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.455
But you have to know how to rock.

36:58.633 --> 37:02.330
- Don't you just rock?
- Oh, no.

37:02.503 --> 37:03.993
- No?
- No.

37:04.171 --> 37:05.695
I'll show you.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.405
Suppose you're tired and worried
about a problem.

37:09.577 --> 37:11.704
Well, then you rock like this.

37:11.879 --> 37:14.507
Like you're on a ship,
away from everything...

37:14.682 --> 37:18.140
...rolling soft and smooth
over the open sea.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.480
Well, then you get to thinking
slow and calm.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.987
Get it? That's the ocean rock.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.990
- I never thought of that before.
- There's the horseback rock.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.993
When you can't sit still,
you gotta be doing something...

37:29.163 --> 37:31.256
...and you rock like this, very fast.

37:31.432 --> 37:32.797
Then the lazy rock.

37:32.967 --> 37:34.832
When there's something
across the room...

37:35.002 --> 37:37.095
...and you're too lazy to get up
and get it...

37:37.271 --> 37:39.296
...well, you just rock over
and get it.

37:39.473 --> 37:43.239
Only chair in the world you can cross
the room without getting up.

37:43.411 --> 37:46.380
I never know there was so much
to a rocking chair.

37:46.547 --> 37:48.515
Won't you take off your things?

37:52.186 --> 37:54.381
Gosh, your house is wonderful.

37:54.555 --> 37:57.422
I got all the back copies
of the magazine and read them...

37:57.591 --> 37:59.684
...so I'd know about you
before I got up here.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.259
We've read all about you too.

38:01.429 --> 38:03.488
It was swell of you to have me up here.

38:03.664 --> 38:05.791
We're very proud to have you here.

38:08.469 --> 38:10.096
Lizka, what's...? What's that?

38:10.271 --> 38:12.205
The baby, of course.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.704
Baby, so quick?

38:13.874 --> 38:15.899
He woke up rather early.

38:16.077 --> 38:19.069
It must be time for something.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.241
- Could be.
- Oh, I know.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.713
- It's time for the baby's bath.
- Is it?

38:26.887 --> 38:30.379
- Yes. I read all about it in your articles.
- Oh, yes, it is.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.025
They're awfully cute in the tub.

38:32.193 --> 38:35.026
Yes, aren't they?

38:35.196 --> 38:37.994
- Well...
- Do you mind if I watch?

38:39.133 --> 38:40.794
Watch?

38:40.968 --> 38:43.960
Oh, no.

38:51.979 --> 38:54.573
- Felix.
- You stay in there. Everything is fine.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.240
- Where did they go?
- They are going to wash the baby.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.646
Good heavens. Both of them?

38:58.819 --> 39:02.084
- Anything wrong?
- Wrong? Oh, no. No, nothing at all.

39:02.256 --> 39:05.384
I'm sorry, judge. I'm afraid we'll
have to postpone the ceremony.

39:05.559 --> 39:07.220
Oh, that's all right. Any time.

39:07.395 --> 39:11.024
Look, judge. I make you a nice martini.
Good? Two martinis, judge.

39:11.198 --> 39:12.426
Two Manhattans.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.965
Two Manhattans.

39:17.171 --> 39:18.934
Well, all set.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.597
Maybe I shouldn't bathe him today.
It's rather cold.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.607
Don't they have to be bathed every day?

39:23.778 --> 39:25.609
No, no. That's the old-fashioned idea.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.305
Oh, gosh. You're not gonna
disappoint me, are you?

39:28.482 --> 39:31.076
Oh, no, I guess not.

39:32.686 --> 39:33.948
- He's a cute one.
- Yes.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.351
- What's his name?
- His name?

39:37.792 --> 39:39.191
Robert. Robert.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.827
Oh, that's a nice name.

39:40.995 --> 39:43.020
Does he talk yet?

39:44.065 --> 39:45.623
No, no.

39:48.536 --> 39:50.299
Does he like his baths?

39:50.471 --> 39:51.836
Oh, yes, he loves them.

39:52.006 --> 39:53.701
I think.

40:14.128 --> 40:16.255
Shall l...? Shall I test the water for you?

40:16.430 --> 40:20.025
Oh, yes, please.
I always test the water.

40:21.635 --> 40:24.661
You seem to know something
about bathing a baby.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.966
Oh, yes. I used to bathe
my sister's kids.

40:27.141 --> 40:28.369
You did?

40:28.542 --> 40:29.873
Oh, sure. Lots of times.

40:30.044 --> 40:31.534
- Really?
- It's okay.

40:31.712 --> 40:34.180
I'm an expert.
My sister's babies got so used to me...

40:34.348 --> 40:37.181
...they'd raise the roof
if I didn't take over at bath time.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.546
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

40:39.720 --> 40:43.019
- You mean you're gonna let me?
- Oh, well, if you're real careful.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.418
Oh, sure.

40:44.592 --> 40:46.753
Come on, skipper. Come on, skipper.

40:46.927 --> 40:49.521
We're gonna get along great.
Yeah, yeah.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.426
Hurry up. Here we go.

40:51.599 --> 40:55.091
Into the drink. Yup, yup.
Oh, there we are.

40:57.671 --> 40:59.571
Did you say the baby's name was Robert?

40:59.740 --> 41:01.105
Yes.

41:01.275 --> 41:03.607
No, no. Roberta.

41:11.619 --> 41:14.611
- Soap?
- Soap, there.

41:15.456 --> 41:17.481
- Sponge?
- Sponge.

41:17.658 --> 41:20.525
We never use one. It isn't sanitary. Here.

41:27.468 --> 41:31.097
Oh, it's such a relief to have
someone else do it for a change.

41:31.272 --> 41:33.570
It gets sort of monotonous
bathing him... Her...

41:33.741 --> 41:35.606
...day after day after day...

41:35.776 --> 41:39.143
Hey, take it easy there, princess.
You're rocking the boat.

41:40.814 --> 41:43.339
- Soap.
- Roberta! How naughty of you.

41:43.517 --> 41:45.382
Here, I'll wipe it off.

41:46.554 --> 41:47.851
There. That all right?

41:48.022 --> 41:49.387
Over here.

41:51.559 --> 41:52.787
- There.
- Thanks.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.758
Oh, Roberta. She's eating the soap.
What'll I do?

41:55.930 --> 41:59.161
- That won't hurt her. They all do it.
- Oh, really?

42:00.568 --> 42:03.435
You'd make a wonderful father,
Mr. Jones.

42:03.604 --> 42:06.505
You're not married yourself,
by any chance, are you?

42:07.107 --> 42:09.541
No. The cards are stacked
against me, I guess.

42:09.710 --> 42:12.838
Every time I meet a girl I like,
it turns out she's already married.

42:13.013 --> 42:14.275
Oh, that's too bad.

42:14.448 --> 42:17.884
But you would get married
if you found someone you liked...

42:18.052 --> 42:20.384
...who wasn't married?

42:20.554 --> 42:23.717
Well, it must be pretty nice
to have a home to come to...

42:23.891 --> 42:26.587
...and a little lady like this.

42:28.028 --> 42:29.689
She doesn't look like you.

42:29.863 --> 42:32.093
Does she look like your husband?

42:32.266 --> 42:33.733
Good heavens, no.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.338
I knew I should regret this.

42:42.509 --> 42:45.103
- Me also.
- Hurry. Yardley will be here at any moment.

42:45.279 --> 42:48.806
Go into the kitchen, get the drinks
for the judge, and in the meantime...

42:48.983 --> 42:50.974
...l'll keep him entertained.

42:52.886 --> 42:55.650
- Are you ready yet?
- No, not quite. Just a few more minutes.

42:55.823 --> 42:59.156
I hope it won't be long. I've gotta
get home and trim my Christmas tree.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.055
Trim your Christmas tree, eh?

43:01.228 --> 43:03.958
Then I'm going to hang up my stocking.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.330
- Oh, quick! Get back in there.
- Well, look, look.

43:08.502 --> 43:10.367
No, not now.
I'm sorry, judge, I'm sorry.

43:16.310 --> 43:20.337
- How do you do? I'm Alexander Yardley.
- Yes, yes. How do you do?

43:20.514 --> 43:22.675
- I'm John Sloan.
- Is Mrs. Lane in?

43:22.850 --> 43:26.616
Mrs. Lane? You mean Mrs. Sloan.
I'm Mr. Sloan.

43:26.787 --> 43:29.551
- Elizabeth Lane's husband?
- Yes. That's... Yes, that's right.

43:29.723 --> 43:31.816
Elizabeth Lane's husband.
Come in, won't you?

43:31.992 --> 43:33.926
- Thank you.
- Well, I'm...

43:34.094 --> 43:37.586
- I'm delighted to see you, Mr. Yardley.
- The pleasure's all mine, Mr. Sloan.

43:37.765 --> 43:40.893
It was considerate of your wife
to ask me. Where is the little lady?

43:41.068 --> 43:44.401
Oh, she's bathing the baby,
and I think Mr. Jones is helping her.

43:44.571 --> 43:46.835
Well, well, that's what
I call real hospitality.

43:47.007 --> 43:49.271
Taking the poor lad
right into your domestic life.

43:49.443 --> 43:52.674
I am deeply touched, deeply touched.
Your wife's a wonderful woman.

43:52.846 --> 43:55.178
- Thank you. May I take these?
- Why, certainly.

43:55.349 --> 43:56.941
And have your coat?

44:15.269 --> 44:18.796
- Well, it's just about time to feed her.
- Feed her? Oh, yes.

44:18.972 --> 44:21.668
Well, you do this,
and I'll go get her dinner.

44:22.309 --> 44:24.140
Okay.

44:24.311 --> 44:25.744
Well, princess...

44:25.913 --> 44:27.437
...how we doing, huh?

44:28.082 --> 44:29.481
Yeah.

44:31.318 --> 44:32.808
Here we are.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.748
Elizabeth, darling.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.152
Oh, merry Christmas, Mr. Yardley.

44:37.324 --> 44:40.157
Merry Christmas, my dear Mrs. Lane.
Or rather, Mrs. Sloan.

44:40.327 --> 44:44.161
It's a great privilege, a great privilege.
I have been admiring your charming room.

44:44.331 --> 44:47.357
It's exactly as you described it. But...

44:47.534 --> 44:49.024
Where is the spinning wheel?

44:49.203 --> 44:52.036
- The spinning wheel?
- Oh, yes, the spinning wheel.

44:52.206 --> 44:55.369
- You wrote about it last month.
- Yes, it's...

44:55.542 --> 44:57.100
oh, it's out being repaired.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.869
You know how antiques are.

44:59.046 --> 45:00.308
Oh, yes, of course.

45:00.481 --> 45:02.415
But what a delightful room.

45:02.583 --> 45:04.414
Such a magnificent fireplace.

45:04.585 --> 45:06.212
I like a good, generous fireplace.

45:06.387 --> 45:09.413
- Makes a room so friendly and warm.
- Yes, indeed.

45:09.590 --> 45:11.990
Yes, I specialize in fireplaces,
Mr. Yardley.

45:12.159 --> 45:14.923
I will never allow any of my clients
to plan without one.

45:15.095 --> 45:18.428
But we don't depend entirely
on the fireplace to warm the house.

45:18.599 --> 45:20.624
- No?
- Oh, no, no. I should say not.

45:20.801 --> 45:24.168
No, we have unit heat, and each
heating pipe has a triple-wall jacket...

45:24.338 --> 45:26.602
...and all the outside walls
are double insulated.

45:26.774 --> 45:29.538
- How interesting.
- Yes. It is. Isn't it?

45:31.879 --> 45:33.141
Well, here we are, Mommy.

45:33.313 --> 45:35.406
All dressed and ready for chow.

45:35.582 --> 45:37.550
Mr. Yardley, this is Mr. Jones.

45:37.718 --> 45:39.709
Mighty proud to meet you, Jones.

45:39.887 --> 45:42.822
- Thank you very much, sir.
- And this is my husband.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.389
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

45:44.558 --> 45:47.789
- It's a mighty fine baby you have, Mr. Lane.
- Sloan is the name.

45:47.961 --> 45:49.189
Well, well, what a cherub.

45:51.231 --> 45:54.291
Oh, there, there.
That's no way to treat a stranger.

45:54.468 --> 45:57.960
I'll take it. I'll have Nora feed it tonight.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.871
Lizka, he looks good on you.

46:04.044 --> 46:05.671
Better than a mink coat, even.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.815
- Felix, how I need one of those.
- No, no, no, no. For the judge.

46:08.982 --> 46:11.610
Oh, Mr. Yardley, this is my uncle Felix.

46:11.785 --> 46:13.377
Merry Christmas. Same to you.

46:13.554 --> 46:15.522
Oh, and how very thoughtful of you, sir.

46:17.558 --> 46:20.823
Excuse me, dear.
Speaking of fireplaces, Mr. Yardley...

46:20.994 --> 46:24.225
...l'd like to show you
a little ingenious thing I've invented.

46:27.601 --> 46:30.729
- I brought you other one with two cherries.
- Thank you very much...

46:30.904 --> 46:34.067
...but I can't wait. I've gotta get home
and trim my Christmas tree.

46:34.241 --> 46:38.041
- I tell them you come back later.
- Why, yes. Of course. I don't live very far.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.578
Just a little ways down the road.
They can call me.

46:40.747 --> 46:43.147
- Here. Here's my card.
- That's very nice, very nice.

46:43.317 --> 46:45.751
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
This way, please.

46:45.919 --> 46:47.887
Come, come, come, come, come.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.283
Out the window?

46:49.456 --> 46:51.788
Oh, a shortcut, huh?

46:53.794 --> 46:56.456
- Why, thank you.
- Don't mention it. It's a pleasure.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.755
Merry Christmas.

47:06.139 --> 47:09.074
Mothproof closets, filtered ventilation
and indirect lighting.

47:09.243 --> 47:12.838
I've introduced all modern conveniences,
without sacrificing the traditionals.

47:13.013 --> 47:16.676
Splendid, splendid. And I suppose
Elizabeth contributed her ideas.

47:16.850 --> 47:18.283
Elizabeth? Oh, yes.

47:18.452 --> 47:20.852
No, no. I should say not.
I'm the architect.

47:21.021 --> 47:23.819
I never allow anyone
to interfere with my plans.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.719
- Oh, Felix?
- Yes?

47:28.262 --> 47:30.389
- Everything okay?
- Hunky-dunky.

47:30.564 --> 47:34.261
Now I go to the kitchen and make a
wonderful dinner, like you never had before.

47:34.434 --> 47:37.164
But I thought Mrs. Sloan
was going to cook the dinner.

47:37.337 --> 47:38.827
Uncle Felix is going to help me.

47:39.006 --> 47:41.201
Actually, I've taught him
everything he knows.

47:41.375 --> 47:43.707
And he always uses my recipes.
Don't you?

47:43.877 --> 47:47.870
He thought it'd be nice to relieve me in the
kitchen so I'd have time with my guests.

47:48.048 --> 47:51.245
That's very thoughtful of him.
But if you'll forgive my saying so...

47:51.418 --> 47:54.216
...I won't feel the same as if you
had cooked it, Mrs. Sloan.

47:54.388 --> 47:56.879
Believe me, you will feel much better.

48:11.134 --> 48:13.659
Nice voice, that boy.

48:13.837 --> 48:15.429
Yes.

48:56.646 --> 48:58.807
Oh, I'm so sorry.

48:58.982 --> 49:01.075
Don't stop.

50:30.573 --> 50:32.905
American Housekeeping,
that's our competitor.

50:33.076 --> 50:36.807
They imitate us in all departments.
Format, layout and contributors.

50:36.980 --> 50:40.643
Now they've instituted a Betty Kane
column, a complete steal on Elizabeth Lane.

50:40.817 --> 50:42.512
Imitation is the sincerest flattery.

50:42.686 --> 50:45.086
That is not all.
Betty Kane is going to have a baby.

50:45.255 --> 50:46.483
- No.
- Yes, sir.

50:46.656 --> 50:48.624
- We've got to nip it in the bud.
- The baby?

50:48.792 --> 50:51.352
I'll tell you how we can kill
two birds with one stone.

50:51.528 --> 50:53.587
- Murder.
- My dear sir.

50:53.763 --> 50:56.288
Last May, our circulation
jumped 200,000.

50:56.466 --> 50:58.627
Think of it, 200,000 new readers
with one issue.

50:58.802 --> 51:01.396
- Do you know why?
- I can't imagine. Another brandy?

51:01.571 --> 51:03.300
Thank you.

51:03.473 --> 51:05.464
Because your wife had a baby.

51:05.642 --> 51:07.200
She did? I mean, we did?

51:07.377 --> 51:11.871
Twenty-three pages
of new advertisements, all baby food.

51:12.048 --> 51:13.982
Her fan mail went up 100 percent.

51:14.150 --> 51:16.243
A hundred percent. Think of it.

51:16.419 --> 51:19.081
Other new mothers all over
the country were interested.

51:19.255 --> 51:21.655
That is the key of my success
in the magazine field.

51:21.825 --> 51:23.918
Human interest, home appeal.
Do you follow me?

51:24.094 --> 51:27.029
- Yes. Go ahead. It's very interesting.
- One baby, 200,000.

51:27.197 --> 51:29.927
Two babies, 400,000.
Babies boost circulation.

51:30.100 --> 51:33.399
Now, Betty Kane is going to have
her baby in September.

51:33.570 --> 51:36.733
We can steal their thunder
and boost circulation at the same time...

51:36.906 --> 51:38.567
...if we beat her to it.

51:38.742 --> 51:40.869
- Beat her to it?
- Have another baby, Sloan.

51:41.044 --> 51:44.013
Have another baby. Any hopes?

51:44.180 --> 51:46.205
Mr. Yardley, Elizabeth's
a very busy woman.

51:46.383 --> 51:48.943
And having babies to boost
your circulation takes time.

51:50.019 --> 51:52.886
Take all the time you need, my dear sir,
all the time you need.

51:53.189 --> 51:54.918
Well, thank you.

51:55.091 --> 51:58.356
- Yes, Nora?
- Telephone for you, Mr. Sloan.

51:58.528 --> 52:00.018
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Yardley.

52:10.106 --> 52:12.074
Hello? Oh, hello, judge.

52:12.242 --> 52:13.470
Yes, I'm glad you called.

52:13.943 --> 52:16.434
What? Fifteen minutes? Oh, my goodness.

52:16.613 --> 52:18.945
Yes, indeed. Absolutely. All right.

52:19.115 --> 52:22.016
Well, I'll arrange everything.
Okay. Goodbye.

52:23.219 --> 52:25.084
Well, my children, I guess it's bedtime.

52:25.255 --> 52:26.882
We retire early on the farm.

52:27.056 --> 52:28.353
Come along, Elizabeth.

52:29.225 --> 52:31.284
John, it's Christmas Eve.

52:31.461 --> 52:35.090
The judge will be here in 15 minutes.

52:35.265 --> 52:37.290
I'm just about ready to turn in.

52:37.467 --> 52:39.958
Nothing like a good dinner
to make a man sleepy.

52:40.136 --> 52:43.196
I'm very grateful to you
for your hospitality, Mrs. Sloan.

52:43.373 --> 52:46.069
- You're welcome.
- I'll just turn out the lights, dear.

52:46.242 --> 52:48.904
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

52:54.617 --> 52:56.778
Good night, Mr. Yardley.
I hope you sleep well.

52:56.953 --> 52:59.183
I shall in that
fine old colonial four-poster.

52:59.355 --> 53:01.255
Good night, Mrs. Sloan.
Good night, Jones.

53:01.424 --> 53:02.982
Good night, Mr. Yardley.

53:08.631 --> 53:11.498
Well, good night, Mrs. Sloan.

53:11.668 --> 53:13.533
Good night, Mr. Jones.

53:31.788 --> 53:33.050
Good night, Nora.

53:33.790 --> 53:35.314
Good night.

53:35.492 --> 53:37.221
Well, of all the brazen...

53:38.194 --> 53:40.287
Right in front of me very eyes.

53:43.900 --> 53:46.368
Well, I arranged that very
neatly, didn't I, dear?

53:46.536 --> 53:48.003
Yes, you did.

53:48.171 --> 53:50.969
And to think that in 15 minutes
we shall be man and wife.

53:51.140 --> 53:52.437
Come.

54:02.252 --> 54:05.517
Nora, where are you going?

54:05.688 --> 54:08.919
Mr. Sloan, I've been working
for you five years...

54:09.092 --> 54:12.357
...and never did I believe that you'd be
the kind of a man that...

54:12.529 --> 54:14.394
of course, I'm not blaming you entirely.

54:14.564 --> 54:16.429
It's the woman that leads
the man astray.

54:16.599 --> 54:19.090
- What are you talking about?
- I'm quitting.

54:19.269 --> 54:21.134
Christmas or no Christmas, I'm quitting.

54:21.304 --> 54:23.204
You can't leave.
We need you as a witness.

54:23.373 --> 54:26.399
The judge will be here in a few moments
to perform the ceremony.

54:26.576 --> 54:29.272
Oh, saints of mercy,
what have I been saying at all?

54:29.445 --> 54:32.243
Oh, Miss Lane, I didn't mean it.
I apologize.

54:32.415 --> 54:35.248
Oh, glory be, I could bite
me wicked tongue out, so I could.

54:35.418 --> 54:37.010
Never mind, Nora. It's all right.

54:37.186 --> 54:40.383
Bless your heart. I might've known
you weren't the kind that would...

54:40.557 --> 54:42.650
- But it's just that l...
- oh, forget it, Nora.

54:42.825 --> 54:45.794
Thank you, miss.
I'm sure 'tis all the luck in the world...

54:45.962 --> 54:47.987
...I do be wishing you both.
- Thanks.

54:48.164 --> 54:51.099
Well, I'll go and take
me things off now.

55:27.704 --> 55:28.932
- Judge.
- Hello.

55:29.105 --> 55:32.472
- Mighty nice of you to come back again.
- Not at all, Sloan, not at all.

55:32.642 --> 55:35.941
My conscience wouldn't let me rest
until you two were married.

55:37.413 --> 55:38.675
Good evening, Miss Lane.

55:38.848 --> 55:40.110
Good evening.

55:40.283 --> 55:43.912
Come along, Elizabeth.
The judge hasn't much time.

55:44.087 --> 55:45.782
Well, come on, dear.

55:51.527 --> 55:53.722
Let's go into the den.
It's more private there.

55:54.897 --> 55:57.457
Look out. Quick, someone's coming.
Come on, quick.

56:19.656 --> 56:21.521
Hello.

56:21.691 --> 56:23.625
Well, how did you get down here?

56:23.793 --> 56:25.488
Down the back stairs.

56:25.662 --> 56:27.562
I'm still catching up
with my nourishment.

56:27.730 --> 56:29.789
Have a drumstick.

56:29.966 --> 56:31.456
Don't mind if I do.

56:37.273 --> 56:39.104
Nice cold Chablis.

56:40.209 --> 56:42.336
Nothing like it with a drumstick.
How about it?

56:42.512 --> 56:45.174
I wish I could. A good bender
might make me feel better.

56:45.348 --> 56:48.408
I suppose an experience like yours
leaves a fellow wobbly, eh?

56:50.420 --> 56:52.285
Mr. Yardley...

56:53.723 --> 56:57.056
...do you think Mrs. Sloan
is happy with her husband?

56:57.226 --> 56:59.786
Why, certainly.
He's a nice, sensible chap...

56:59.962 --> 57:01.793
...steady, conscientious, successful.

57:02.398 --> 57:04.662
Yeah, I guess that kind
does make a good husband.

57:05.168 --> 57:06.965
Indubitably, my boy, indubitably.

57:07.136 --> 57:08.569
A fine couple.

57:11.074 --> 57:13.975
- What's he doing now?
- I don't know. He's still in the kitchen.

57:14.143 --> 57:16.134
- I hear voices.
- We can't wait any longer.

57:16.312 --> 57:17.973
Let's get on with the ceremony.

57:21.250 --> 57:22.478
What about witnesses?

57:22.652 --> 57:25.212
- Yes, we must have witnesses.
- I'll get Felix and Nora.

57:25.388 --> 57:27.379
All right, dear. But hurry, hurry.

57:27.557 --> 57:29.081
- Skimmed milk for six weeks...

57:29.258 --> 57:31.658
...you don't know how wonderful
it is to be able...

57:31.828 --> 57:34.661
...to come downstairs and raid an icebox.
- You're telling me?

57:34.831 --> 57:38.358
- I've been on a diet of creamed turnip fluff.
- Why were they picking on you?

57:38.534 --> 57:41.435
- Doctor says I'm too fat.
- Can you imagine that?

57:41.604 --> 57:45.005
I began feeling better the minute
I stopped paying any attention to him.

57:45.942 --> 57:48.274
Mrs. Sloan can certainly roast a chicken.

57:48.444 --> 57:50.537
Cold chicken is my weakness.

57:50.713 --> 57:53.113
- Have some more chicken, sir?
- Thank you.

57:55.017 --> 57:57.042
Oh, hello.

57:57.220 --> 57:58.881
Caught us red-handed, didn't you?

57:59.055 --> 58:00.852
Not at all. I'm glad you feel at home.

58:01.023 --> 58:03.719
- How about a wing?
- No, thank you. I couldn't eat a thing.

58:03.893 --> 58:06.088
- A glass of wine, perhaps?
- No, I must be going.

58:06.262 --> 58:08.526
- No, wait a while.
- No, really, I have to go.

58:08.698 --> 58:09.995
If you'll excuse me.

58:11.834 --> 58:14.166
- What's that?
- Why, that must be Macushlah.

58:14.337 --> 58:16.771
- Macushlah?
- Your cow. That's right.

58:16.939 --> 58:19.840
You did say in one of your articles
she wouldn't settle down...

58:20.009 --> 58:22.170
...unless you go in
and bid her good night.

58:22.345 --> 58:24.472
Well, hello, Macushlah.

58:27.083 --> 58:29.415
I'll help you put her back
in the barn if you like.

58:29.585 --> 58:31.985
That's very nice of you,
but I don't think l...

58:32.155 --> 58:35.147
oh, it's no trouble at all.
I'll get your coat for you.

58:35.324 --> 58:37.792
The perfect pastoral touch.
This is a real experience.

58:37.960 --> 58:40.121
- Won't you finish your supper?
- Thank you.

58:40.296 --> 58:41.661
Mrs. Sloan, would you mind...

58:41.831 --> 58:44.766
...if I came down and watched you
cook breakfast in the morning?

58:44.934 --> 58:47.425
- Watch me cook breakfast?
- I remember what you said...

58:47.603 --> 58:52.165
...about the charm of an attractive woman
performing her task of flipping flapjacks...

58:52.341 --> 58:55.640
...with the smell of good coffee
and sizzling bacon in a sunny kitchen.

58:55.812 --> 58:59.441
- I'm homesick for a sight like that.
- You see, Nora usually fixes breakfast.

58:59.615 --> 59:02.140
- You do it tomorrow just for me.
- Mr. Yardley, l...

59:02.318 --> 59:05.014
This is the only one I could find.

59:05.188 --> 59:07.247
Hold everything.
We'll be right with you.

59:07.423 --> 59:08.913
Mr. Jones, I'm very tired.

59:09.091 --> 59:11.457
I think I'd better call Nora.

59:11.627 --> 59:13.822
Soo, boss. Soo, boss. Soo, boss.

59:13.996 --> 59:15.588
No, now quit your griping.

59:16.199 --> 59:18.531
Here. Here she is.

59:32.481 --> 59:33.971
What a night.

59:34.150 --> 59:35.515
What a night.

59:35.685 --> 59:38.153
Moonlight, snow.

59:38.321 --> 59:40.118
And a cow.

59:40.289 --> 59:43.281
- Do all animals take to you, Mrs. Sloan?
- Oh, yes. Of course...

59:43.459 --> 59:44.687
...some more than others.

59:44.861 --> 59:47.955
Yes. They have their likes and dislikes
just like human beings.

59:48.130 --> 59:50.496
- Yes.
- Myself, I like most people.

59:50.666 --> 59:52.429
Some more than others, of course.

59:52.602 --> 59:56.333
Is there anyone you like more
than the others at the moment?

59:56.505 --> 59:58.666
Definitely.

59:59.075 --> 01:00:01.839
- A girl?
- Yes.

01:00:02.011 --> 01:00:03.876
Are you in love with her?

01:00:04.914 --> 01:00:07.712
Well, in a way, yes.

01:00:07.884 --> 01:00:09.579
In what way?

01:00:09.752 --> 01:00:12.949
Well, l... I admire her very much.

01:00:13.422 --> 01:00:15.754
I think she's about the swellest
person I ever met.

01:00:16.425 --> 01:00:18.120
Is that as far as it goes?

01:00:18.694 --> 01:00:20.525
She's... She's married.

01:00:24.467 --> 01:00:26.697
Does...?

01:00:26.869 --> 01:00:28.336
Does she like animals?

01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:30.404
Yes.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.704
Do animals like her?

01:00:33.876 --> 01:00:35.605
Oh, yes.

01:00:36.112 --> 01:00:38.307
Does she live on a farm?

01:00:40.783 --> 01:00:43.183
- Yes.
- Jefferson Jones, are you flirting with me?

01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:46.253
- Oh, no, I wouldn't dare.
- Oh, don't apologize. I'm flattered.

01:00:46.422 --> 01:00:50.882
It's intriguing to a married woman to find
she's still attractive to the opposite sex.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.755
But l...

01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:56.287
Do I attract you?

01:00:57.266 --> 01:00:58.961
Yes.

01:00:59.135 --> 01:01:03.128
But you see, you were so different
from what I expected. I was...

01:01:03.306 --> 01:01:05.536
- Knocked for a loop?
- You said it.

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.437
Oh, how nice.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:09.475
But l... I shouldn't have told you.

01:01:09.645 --> 01:01:11.476
Your being married and all that, l...

01:01:11.647 --> 01:01:14.844
But, you know, I find it hard
to believe you are married.

01:01:15.017 --> 01:01:17.884
I find it pretty difficult myself.

01:01:18.054 --> 01:01:21.182
You don't act as if you were married.

01:01:21.357 --> 01:01:23.689
I don't feel as if I was married.

01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:25.690
Really?

01:01:25.861 --> 01:01:28.557
Must be the moonlight and the snow.

01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:30.130
And the cow.

01:01:30.299 --> 01:01:33.029
Oh, where is the cow?

01:01:33.202 --> 01:01:34.931
Oh, you must have dropped the rope.

01:01:35.104 --> 01:01:37.595
Could be. My hands got so cold.

01:01:40.643 --> 01:01:42.270
Gosh, they are cold.

01:01:42.445 --> 01:01:43.912
Let me warm them for you.

01:01:46.582 --> 01:01:49.107
Oh, that's fine.

01:01:51.287 --> 01:01:52.652
Have...?

01:01:52.822 --> 01:01:55.757
Have you ever kissed
a married woman?

01:01:55.925 --> 01:01:57.392
No.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.891
No?

01:01:59.061 --> 01:02:00.289
No.

01:02:00.963 --> 01:02:03.022
No, you're not the type.

01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:05.759
L... I wish I was.

01:02:05.935 --> 01:02:08.768
Oh, me too.

01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:15.269
Well, and that's that.

01:02:15.444 --> 01:02:17.207
Yeah. I guess it is.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.041
Better look for the cow.

01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:21.615
Yes, I guess we had better.

01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:26.553
Oh, there she is.

01:02:26.722 --> 01:02:28.952
- That's the barn.
- It is?

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.422
I mean, it is.

01:02:30.593 --> 01:02:31.992
Yeah.

01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:35.426
Do you think she got back
there all by herself?

01:02:35.598 --> 01:02:37.225
Maybe.

01:02:42.438 --> 01:02:44.167
There she is.

01:02:47.343 --> 01:02:48.776
Nice cow.

01:02:48.944 --> 01:02:50.241
Lovely brown eyes.

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.840
Oh, no, no. They're gray.

01:02:53.015 --> 01:02:55.950
Really? All the cows I ever knew
had brown ones.

01:02:56.886 --> 01:02:58.251
Nice firm rump.

01:03:03.192 --> 01:03:04.625
Well, good night, Macushlah.

01:03:04.794 --> 01:03:07.490
Good night, Macushlah.
Thank you so much.

01:03:28.417 --> 01:03:30.544
Elizabeth, are you all right?

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:34.155
Oh, I feel wonderful, darling.

01:03:34.323 --> 01:03:36.257
How are you?

01:03:39.395 --> 01:03:40.760
I thought you'd gone to bed.

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:43.057
There are one or two things
we have to discuss.

01:03:43.232 --> 01:03:45.132
- Tonight?
- It's been an upsetting evening.

01:03:45.301 --> 01:03:47.531
Of all the insane, inconsiderate things
to do...

01:03:47.703 --> 01:03:49.466
Could I help it if the cow got loose?

01:03:49.638 --> 01:03:51.162
The cow. A fine "how do you do."

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.900
- The judge was very annoyed.
- Oh, was he?

01:03:54.076 --> 01:03:56.271
Yes. Do you mind?

01:03:56.445 --> 01:03:58.379
Really, Elizabeth, this is very awkward.

01:03:58.547 --> 01:04:00.174
Where am I going to sleep tonight?

01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:03.648
You sleep in your room, and I've put
my things in the guest bedroom.

01:04:03.819 --> 01:04:06.879
- Oh, fine. And this is my wedding night.
- Go to bed, John.

01:04:07.056 --> 01:04:09.081
But we've got to get these things settled.

01:04:09.258 --> 01:04:11.692
- Go to bed, John.
- Oh, all right, if you insist.

01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:14.261
The judge will be here
first thing in the morning...

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.888
- Good night, John.
- Good night.

01:04:18.067 --> 01:04:19.500
Please.

01:04:20.736 --> 01:04:23.000
But I shan't sleep a wink.

01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:26.369
Not a wink.

01:05:06.682 --> 01:05:09.014
The cow? What happened then?

01:05:09.185 --> 01:05:10.516
Nothing. The judge went home.

01:05:10.686 --> 01:05:12.051
Now I like cows.

01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:13.984
Oh, Felix, he's so wonderful.

01:05:14.156 --> 01:05:15.885
Sure. They are fine animals.

01:05:16.058 --> 01:05:19.585
Milk and cream, they give,
and butter too. And buttermilk.

01:05:19.762 --> 01:05:21.753
No, no. I mean Mr. Jones.

01:05:21.931 --> 01:05:25.662
I've never met anyone like him
before in my whole life.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:28.234
Oh, Lizka, Lizka.
You give me goose pimples.

01:05:28.404 --> 01:05:31.771
Watch now. I show you how
to flip-flop the flop-flips.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.948
You see? It's easy. Now you try it.

01:05:41.116 --> 01:05:42.743
Throw it up.

01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:45.047
Up!

01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:46.984
Not on the stove.

01:05:47.156 --> 01:05:51.252
In the pan. Now, throw it with this.

01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.019
High, high, high, high.

01:05:53.195 --> 01:05:55.026
Oh, up!

01:06:03.272 --> 01:06:05.206
Take this. Throw it up.

01:06:05.374 --> 01:06:07.103
High, high, high. Oh, up!

01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:12.076
Lizka, better you cook on the typewriter.

01:06:12.248 --> 01:06:13.875
Oh, Felix, what am I going to do?

01:06:14.049 --> 01:06:16.643
Don't ask me. Ask the rocking chair.

01:06:16.819 --> 01:06:18.548
I'll answer it.

01:06:22.725 --> 01:06:25.125
I'm Mrs. Gerzeg.

01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:28.155
Thank you for taking care
of our babies while we work.

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:30.230
Mrs. Wright told me
you took care of hers.

01:06:30.399 --> 01:06:31.730
Yes, but where is her baby?

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.891
She doesn't need to leave
her baby today.

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:36.196
She's not working. I have to work.

01:06:36.372 --> 01:06:38.272
- So I leave you mine.
- Yes, but...

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.375
I have to go to work. Thank you so much.
Darling, be careful.

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:43.568
He's no trouble at all.
His name's Louie.

01:06:43.746 --> 01:06:45.236
I'm late to the factory.

01:06:45.414 --> 01:06:47.678
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:06:50.052 --> 01:06:51.917
He?

01:06:52.254 --> 01:06:53.812
Hey!

01:06:55.257 --> 01:06:56.884
Oh, Felix. This is awful.

01:06:57.059 --> 01:06:59.084
We have a new baby. It's a boy.

01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:02.355
It's life. Sometimes you get girls.
Sometimes, boys.

01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:05.557
- Mrs. Sloan.
- Oh, here, quick, take it.

01:07:05.734 --> 01:07:08.567
Take it around the back
to the bedroom. Hurry up.

01:07:13.242 --> 01:07:15.005
- Hello.
- Good morning. Merry Christmas.

01:07:15.177 --> 01:07:17.407
I hope I'm in time to see
you flip the flapjacks.

01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:19.672
I'm not in a flipping mood this morning.

01:07:19.848 --> 01:07:23.409
Nora will attend to breakfast. Nora,
Mr. Yardley wants to watch you flap...

01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:25.519
I mean, flip the flapjacks.

01:07:25.688 --> 01:07:27.451
I don't flip them. I scoop them.

01:07:27.623 --> 01:07:29.090
Won't you flip just one for me?

01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:32.455
I never flipped in me life,
and I won't start flipping now for nobody.

01:07:32.628 --> 01:07:33.856
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:36.896
I must go now.
If you'll excuse me, please.

01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:39.626
I've been looking for you.
The judge is in the study.

01:07:39.802 --> 01:07:41.394
Let's hurry before anyone sees us.

01:07:44.506 --> 01:07:46.838
But, John, couldn't we all
have breakfast first?

01:07:47.009 --> 01:07:51.002
There you are. Now, if you'll stand here,
please, and join hands.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.579
Where are the witnesses?

01:07:52.748 --> 01:07:54.113
Mrs. Sloan.

01:07:54.283 --> 01:07:56.183
Oh, excuse me.

01:07:56.352 --> 01:07:58.650
Well, this looks like a wedding.

01:07:58.821 --> 01:08:00.686
It does? I mean, it is.

01:08:00.856 --> 01:08:02.483
You see, it's an old custom.

01:08:02.658 --> 01:08:04.091
We were married on Christmas...

01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:06.659
...so we usually repeat
the ceremony every Christmas.

01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:08.558
Well, well, what a charming idea.

01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:11.996
I hope you don't mind my being here.
I'm quite a sentimentalist myself.

01:08:12.167 --> 01:08:14.135
Now all we need is one more witness.

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:16.635
- Suppose I get Mr. Jones?
- No, no. I'll get Felix.

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:18.796
No, no. You stay here. I'll get Felix.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.071
Felix!

01:08:26.048 --> 01:08:27.537
Felix!

01:08:27.716 --> 01:08:29.843
The judge is here. We need you
as a witness.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:33.419
But, Mr. Sloan, something happened.
Something terrible. Catastrophe.

01:08:33.589 --> 01:08:35.113
- What is it?
- The baby.

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:36.518
The baby. My watch.

01:08:36.692 --> 01:08:37.920
I gave him to play with it.

01:08:38.093 --> 01:08:39.787
He put it in her mouth.

01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:41.759
Goodbye, watch.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:44.125
You mean to say the baby
swallowed your watch?

01:08:44.299 --> 01:08:47.928
- Good heavens. I must call a doctor.
- The police too. It was a gold watch.

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:51.238
- What is it?
- The baby swallowed his watch.

01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:54.535
- I'm calling a doctor.
- Oh, how awful. I must go to it.

01:08:56.377 --> 01:08:59.575
Don't get excited, Mrs. Sloan.
Babies often swallow things like that.

01:08:59.747 --> 01:09:03.649
Poor darling.
Does your little tummy hurt?

01:09:03.819 --> 01:09:06.344
That's strange.
He looks different this morning.

01:09:06.522 --> 01:09:09.116
Wouldn't you look different if you
had swallowed a watch?

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:10.952
- But he's a blond.
- Mama.

01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:12.889
- He has teeth.
- Mama, Mama.

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.528
- And he talks.
- Mr. Yardley...

01:09:14.696 --> 01:09:16.755
...this is no time to take inventory.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.763
Oh, please go. I must get him quiet.
Please go.

01:09:21.937 --> 01:09:24.497
Most extraordinary thing I ever saw.

01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:35.841
- How is it?
- There's only one thing to do.

01:09:36.018 --> 01:09:37.246
A good dose of castor oil.

01:09:37.419 --> 01:09:40.911
- I'll go upstairs and see if we have any.
- When is that doctor getting here?

01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:44.115
I wouldn't want anything to happen.
It would ruin the circulation.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:46.625
It wouldn't do the baby no good, neither.

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:54.062
Lizka.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:57.034
Felix, this is awful.
Has the doctor arrived yet?

01:09:57.206 --> 01:09:58.639
No. But the judge went home.

01:10:03.645 --> 01:10:05.442
Felix!

01:10:07.716 --> 01:10:10.617
Oh, Felix, you did it to stop the wedding.

01:10:10.786 --> 01:10:12.617
If a cow can do it, I can do it.

01:10:12.788 --> 01:10:15.222
Oh, Felix. You're wonderful.

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:16.880
Moo.

01:10:17.793 --> 01:10:19.818
- Excuse me.
- What's the matter?

01:10:19.995 --> 01:10:21.656
The baby swallowed a watch.

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:24.060
- He swallowed what?
- Felix's watch.

01:10:24.233 --> 01:10:25.723
He gave it back.

01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:27.892
The baby swallowed that?

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.231
Everything is hunky-dunky.
It's still going.

01:10:30.405 --> 01:10:32.202
How is the child? Is it all right?

01:10:32.374 --> 01:10:33.602
Oh, perfectly fine.

01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:36.266
- And where's Mr. Yardley?
- I think he's in the den.

01:10:36.445 --> 01:10:38.538
Let's have breakfast.
Good morning, Mr. Jones.

01:10:38.714 --> 01:10:41.148
Good morning. You're having lots
of excitement here.

01:10:41.316 --> 01:10:44.149
- Yes, but it's all over now.
- Do you mind if I see the baby?

01:10:44.319 --> 01:10:48.255
Oh, no. You mustn't. It's been through
a trying experience. And I want it to rest.

01:10:48.423 --> 01:10:51.790
Suppose you have breakfast.
Nora's making some lovely pancakes.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.088
- Where's the judge?
- He will be back later.

01:10:55.264 --> 01:10:58.722
But if you don't get married, then you
will have to wait until next year.

01:10:58.901 --> 01:11:01.631
That settles it. I'm tired
of having my marriage put off.

01:11:01.803 --> 01:11:04.567
- I'm going to tell Mr. Yardley the truth.
- No, John, please.

01:11:05.674 --> 01:11:08.268
I think it's best we skedaddle.

01:11:08.443 --> 01:11:13.574
When the bag lets out the cat,
somebody gets scratched.

01:11:13.749 --> 01:11:16.081
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

01:11:16.251 --> 01:11:18.515
There's something I want
to talk to you about too.

01:11:18.687 --> 01:11:20.655
- Something important.
- What I have to say...

01:11:20.822 --> 01:11:23.689
I'm not easily fooled.
I know the real from the fraudulent.

01:11:23.859 --> 01:11:26.293
Exactly. I knew you'd realize.
That's why I decided...

01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:28.361
- Those models are yours, of course.
- Yes.

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:30.964
They're splendid.
That's why I want to talk to you.

01:11:31.133 --> 01:11:32.361
- Those?
- Yes.

01:11:32.534 --> 01:11:36.026
I told you about my competitor in the
magazine field, American Housekeeping.

01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:39.105
I'm going to keep ahead of them.
I'm starting a new department.

01:11:39.274 --> 01:11:41.071
- But...
- A Build Your own Home section...

01:11:41.243 --> 01:11:45.304
...for postwar planning. I need an editor.
An honest and dependable man.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.041
I know you're the real thing.
I know you're busy, but this will pay well.

01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:52.414
- It all sounds very wonderful, Mr. Yardley.
- You bet it's wonderful.

01:11:52.588 --> 01:11:54.715
It's the biggest promotion plan
in the country.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.825
And the tie-up with
the Elizabeth Lane feature will put it over.

01:11:57.993 --> 01:11:59.790
I can see our February cover right now.

01:11:59.962 --> 01:12:02.795
"Beginning this issue, John Sloan,
Elizabeth Lane's husband...

01:12:02.965 --> 01:12:05.058
...conducts our new Home Planning
Department."

01:12:05.233 --> 01:12:07.133
- And you'll put that on the cover?
- Right.

01:12:07.302 --> 01:12:09.167
Now, what is it you wanted to tell me?

01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:12.000
As a matter of fact, it was
almost exactly the same thing.

01:12:12.174 --> 01:12:14.404
Well, there you are,
great minds think alike.

01:12:14.576 --> 01:12:17.170
Mr. Yardley, Mr. Jones is
way ahead of you on flapjacks.

01:12:17.346 --> 01:12:20.144
He is, is he? Well, I'll give him
a head start of a dozen...

01:12:20.315 --> 01:12:22.408
...and still eat him under the table.

01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:24.779
- Did you tell him?
- Well, no. I decided not to.

01:12:24.953 --> 01:12:26.978
There's no point in destroying
his Christmas.

01:12:27.155 --> 01:12:28.520
Come on, let's have breakfast.

01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:36.053
Would you mind doing something for me,
as a special favor?

01:12:36.231 --> 01:12:37.459
Anything you want.

01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:39.658
Would you mind just flipping me
one flapjack?

01:12:40.335 --> 01:12:42.599
Flip...

01:12:42.771 --> 01:12:47.765
- Well, you see, Mr. Yardley...
- oh, just one to please me, huh?

01:12:47.943 --> 01:12:51.344
- But, Mr. Yardley...
- Won't you please, Mrs. Sloan?

01:12:53.548 --> 01:12:58.645
Well, all right, but I'm
a little out of practice.

01:13:07.362 --> 01:13:08.795
- Oh, come on.
- Go ahead.

01:13:08.964 --> 01:13:10.454
Go on, dear.

01:13:20.175 --> 01:13:22.473
Bravo!

01:13:22.844 --> 01:13:24.209
Wonderful.

01:13:31.019 --> 01:13:34.045
And for dinner, Mr. Yardley,
we will have potage Mongol...

01:13:34.222 --> 01:13:37.214
...with roast goose Bernoise,
with walnut stuffing.

01:13:37.392 --> 01:13:38.825
Oh, Uncle Felix, stop.

01:13:38.994 --> 01:13:41.656
Please. You make my mouth water.

01:13:45.267 --> 01:13:46.495
Good morning.

01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:47.930
- Mr. Sloan?
- Yes.

01:13:48.103 --> 01:13:49.468
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:53.404
I'm Homer Higgenbottom of the Christmas
Entertainment Committee of Stanfield.

01:13:53.575 --> 01:13:56.408
Mr. Sloan, I understand you're
entertaining Jefferson Jones...

01:13:56.578 --> 01:13:58.671
...the war hero. Is this the young man?

01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:01.577
- Yes, that's right.
- I'm proud to shake your hand.

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.978
Thank you, sir.

01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:05.949
We're having a community dance
this evening at the town hall.

01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:10.217
People of Stanfield would consider it a great
honor to entertain you and your guests.

01:14:10.392 --> 01:14:11.882
I hope you can all come.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.721
Well, how about it, Elizabeth?

01:14:13.895 --> 01:14:16.227
A dance?

01:14:16.398 --> 01:14:19.094
Do you dance, Mr. Jones?

01:14:19.267 --> 01:14:21.667
Oh, I get around.

01:14:21.837 --> 01:14:24.135
I think it would be lovely.

01:14:27.876 --> 01:14:29.343
Salute your partners.

01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:31.411
On the right. On the left.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.741
Join hands, circle left.

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.011
Meet your partner.

01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:42.952
Promenade.

01:14:47.395 --> 01:14:50.364
Forward, everybody swing.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:58.403
Forward, and do-si-do.

01:15:00.175 --> 01:15:01.699
Around to the right.

01:15:03.712 --> 01:15:05.839
Now around to the left.

01:15:06.014 --> 01:15:10.246
Around you go.
Swing your partners right and left.

01:15:11.219 --> 01:15:12.516
Isn't this lovely?

01:15:12.687 --> 01:15:15.349
Eighteen days on a raft was
nothing compared with this.

01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:23.325
With the new prefabricated methods
and postwar plastics...

01:15:23.498 --> 01:15:25.830
...we shall positively revolutionize
homebuilding.

01:15:26.001 --> 01:15:28.492
Quite right, Sloan. Quite right.

01:15:34.376 --> 01:15:36.537
Sashay down the floor.

01:15:38.847 --> 01:15:40.280
Around you go.

01:15:41.817 --> 01:15:45.344
Form an arch and all follow through.

01:15:50.959 --> 01:15:54.451
Everybody forward and form a star.

01:15:55.564 --> 01:15:57.191
Around to the right.

01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:01.659
Now to the left.

01:16:06.308 --> 01:16:08.139
All break away.

01:16:26.061 --> 01:16:30.464
You see, with the new high-compression
plywood, we'd become pioneers. Yes, sir.

01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:34.466
Remember, this whole proposition depends
on that other matter I discussed with you.

01:16:34.636 --> 01:16:36.069
What other matter, Mr. Yardley?

01:16:36.238 --> 01:16:41.039
We've got to beat American Housekeeping
to that new baby.

01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:44.736
Oh, of course, of course.
That will be attended to, naturally.

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:57.985
A progressive architect like myself...

01:16:58.159 --> 01:17:01.526
Mr. Sloan, Mr. Yardley, we are relying
on you two to start the bond sale.

01:17:01.696 --> 01:17:03.561
- Why, of course.
- Whenever you say.

01:17:03.732 --> 01:17:05.256
If you'll follow me, gentlemen.

01:18:01.823 --> 01:18:03.051
Sure is nice here.

01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:05.089
I'll hate to leave tomorrow.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.820
- That soon?
- I'm due back tomorrow night.

01:18:07.996 --> 01:18:13.559
- I'll have to leave early in the morning.
- Oh, so this is our...?

01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:16.533
Your last night here?

01:18:16.705 --> 01:18:18.070
I had a wonderful time.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:22.300
- You've all been very kind to me.
- Oh, let's keep on walking.

01:18:24.245 --> 01:18:26.577
But your shoes.

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:29.808
Oh, yes, they are sort of inadequate.

01:18:29.985 --> 01:18:34.217
I guess I was just letting my imagination
run away with me.

01:18:34.389 --> 01:18:35.856
Why not?

01:18:37.492 --> 01:18:39.858
Milady, your carriage.

01:18:40.028 --> 01:18:44.294
- Oh, we couldn't.
- It's just parked here. Nobody will mind.

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:46.957
We'll make believe we're going for a ride.

01:18:48.803 --> 01:18:50.168
Where should we go?

01:18:50.338 --> 01:18:52.806
Well, where do you generally go
in your dreams?

01:18:55.744 --> 01:18:57.336
The horse is moving.

01:18:57.512 --> 01:18:59.275
It wasn't tied up.

01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:33.171
Confound it!

01:19:45.026 --> 01:19:46.687
Speaking of marriage...

01:19:46.861 --> 01:19:49.329
- Were we?
- No.

01:19:49.497 --> 01:19:51.488
I guess I was just talking out loud.

01:19:51.666 --> 01:19:53.634
I've got marriage on my mind these days.

01:19:53.802 --> 01:19:56.396
So have I.

01:19:56.571 --> 01:20:00.337
If I wasn't married,
what would you say to me now?

01:20:00.508 --> 01:20:04.069
Well, first I'd call you Lizka,
like Uncle Felix does.

01:20:04.245 --> 01:20:06.213
- Say it.
- Lizka.

01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:10.215
- Say it again.
- Lizka.

01:20:10.385 --> 01:20:11.818
And then what would you say?

01:20:12.387 --> 01:20:15.288
L... Gosh, I guess I couldn't say anything.

01:20:15.457 --> 01:20:18.483
I know. It's all so lovely.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.127
So lovely.

01:20:20.295 --> 01:20:21.922
You're lovely too.

01:20:22.664 --> 01:20:24.325
Go on, don't stop.

01:20:24.499 --> 01:20:25.989
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

01:20:26.167 --> 01:20:28.601
I'm having fun,
I admit that, but believe me...

01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:31.204
...if I'm making fun of anybody,
it's Elizabeth Lane.

01:20:31.372 --> 01:20:33.636
- Why?
- Oh, she's so smart. Knows all the answers.

01:20:33.808 --> 01:20:37.437
Gets herself into a mess and hasn't
the moral courage to get herself out of it.

01:20:37.612 --> 01:20:39.443
You're not very happy, are you?

01:20:39.614 --> 01:20:42.481
Well, I'm as happy
as I have any right to be.

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:45.778
I think you deserve all
the happiness in the world.

01:20:45.954 --> 01:20:47.751
You do?

01:20:47.922 --> 01:20:49.253
I think you're wonderful.

01:20:50.158 --> 01:20:51.819
You do?

01:20:53.661 --> 01:20:56.323
- Maybe we'd better turn back.
- No. Not yet.

01:20:57.999 --> 01:20:59.591
Okay.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.634
I'm going to spend
the night at me sister's.

01:21:11.746 --> 01:21:15.147
That makes 50,000 I owe myself.

01:21:15.316 --> 01:21:17.511
I'm going to spend
the night at me sister's.

01:21:17.685 --> 01:21:19.448
Mrs. Gerzeg worked overtime tonight...

01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:22.181
...and she'll be coming along
pretty soon for her baby.

01:21:22.357 --> 01:21:24.450
If she cries, you better change her.

01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:26.491
Mrs. Gerzeg?

01:21:26.661 --> 01:21:28.822
Never mind. Skip it.

01:21:28.997 --> 01:21:31.022
Good night.

01:21:44.379 --> 01:21:46.210
Hey, you.

01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:47.643
Hey.

01:21:49.884 --> 01:21:51.545
Where do you think you're going?

01:21:51.719 --> 01:21:53.744
That's what we'd like to know.

01:21:53.922 --> 01:21:55.981
Stealing my sleigh
for a joy ride, huh?

01:21:56.157 --> 01:21:58.022
- Well, get out.
- Oh, we didn't steal it.

01:21:58.193 --> 01:22:01.492
That's what you say. You're four miles
from where Mr. Harper parked it.

01:22:01.663 --> 01:22:04.223
- Holy smokes.
- You didn't get very far, did you?

01:22:04.399 --> 01:22:06.594
The horse just walked away
with us accidentally.

01:22:06.768 --> 01:22:09.703
- Oh, sure.
- Tell that to the judge, will you?

01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:12.271
- You mean, you're arresting us?
- That's right, lady.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.738
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Sorry, lady. In the car.

01:22:14.909 --> 01:22:17.673
- Mister, really...
- All right, Harper. There's your sleigh.

01:22:17.845 --> 01:22:20.439
- You better show up to prefer charges.
- Thanks, sheriff.

01:22:42.303 --> 01:22:43.770
Yoo-hoo.

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:51.835
It's me, Mrs. Gerzeg.

01:22:52.013 --> 01:22:53.776
I've come for my baby.

01:23:39.894 --> 01:23:41.452
Hey! Hey!

01:23:42.764 --> 01:23:44.163
Felix!

01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:47.600
Felix!

01:23:48.202 --> 01:23:49.635
Where is everybody?

01:23:51.539 --> 01:23:53.666
Give me the police. The state troopers.

01:23:53.841 --> 01:23:55.206
The FBI. Quick!

01:23:55.376 --> 01:23:56.968
This is Alexander Yardley.

01:23:57.145 --> 01:23:59.670
Certainly it's an emergency!
A baby has been kidnapped.

01:23:59.847 --> 01:24:01.144
- Kidnapped?
- Yes.

01:24:01.316 --> 01:24:03.648
Look. Don't get excited.
Everything is hunky-dunky.

01:24:03.818 --> 01:24:05.115
Are you out of your mind?

01:24:05.286 --> 01:24:07.754
Do you realize what this baby
means to my circulation?

01:24:07.922 --> 01:24:10.686
- Mr. Yardley, please.
- No, don't argue with me. Get Sloan.

01:24:10.858 --> 01:24:13.691
Go down to the town hall
and bring him back immediately.

01:24:13.861 --> 01:24:15.920
Hello. Is this the state police?

01:24:16.097 --> 01:24:17.496
This is Alexander Yardley.

01:24:17.665 --> 01:24:20.498
Yes, the Alexander Yardley.

01:24:20.668 --> 01:24:23.193
The Smart Housekeeping baby
has been kidnapped!

01:24:25.273 --> 01:24:27.707
- Can we have a description of the baby?
- Photographs?

01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:30.366
- We're from the Daily Press.
- How old was the baby?

01:24:30.545 --> 01:24:33.036
He's 8 months old. A boy.
He has blond hair and teeth.

01:24:33.214 --> 01:24:34.579
- Blond hair and teeth?
- No, no.

01:24:34.749 --> 01:24:36.740
- No blond hair? No teeth?
- That's right.

01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:39.614
I'll give a $25,000 reward
for the return of that baby.

01:24:39.787 --> 01:24:41.015
Twenty-five grand.

01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:43.521
It's the Elizabeth Lane baby,
the most famous baby.

01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:45.420
- Where are its parents?
- Here's Sloan.

01:24:45.593 --> 01:24:48.494
- Will you give us a story?
- Quiet, please. He doesn't know yet.

01:24:48.663 --> 01:24:53.066
Come inside, my boy. I have something
to tell you. Keep a stiff upper lip.

01:24:53.234 --> 01:24:54.826
Excuse me.

01:25:07.882 --> 01:25:10.908
- I'm sorry about the arrest, Mrs. Sloan.
- That's all right.

01:25:11.085 --> 01:25:14.145
If we'd realized who you people were,
it wouldn't have happened.

01:25:14.322 --> 01:25:16.847
- Well, good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:21.922
Good night? It's morning.

01:25:22.096 --> 01:25:24.860
Imagine us being arrested.

01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:28.399
Your husband won't think it's so funny
coming home at 7 in the morning.

01:25:28.569 --> 01:25:31.663
Oh, they all went to bed hours ago.
We seem to have company.

01:25:32.673 --> 01:25:34.368
Yeah.

01:26:04.705 --> 01:26:06.900
- No?
- No.

01:26:18.453 --> 01:26:20.011
Elizabeth, where've you been?

01:26:20.188 --> 01:26:22.918
- Yes, where have you been?
- When did you last see the baby?

01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:24.387
Quiet, everybody.

01:26:24.559 --> 01:26:26.083
Where do you suppose she's been?

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.821
She's been out searching every nook
and cranny for her lost baby, of course.

01:26:29.997 --> 01:26:32.022
- My lost baby?
- There, there, Mrs. Sloan.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.930
You mustn't collapse now.
No, indeed. You must be brave.

01:26:35.102 --> 01:26:38.094
- Hold still, Mr. Jones.
- Did you get any ransom note?

01:26:38.272 --> 01:26:40.866
Take it easy, boys.
Mr. Jones is just out of hospital.

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:43.840
Go into the kitchen, Jones.
Felix has some coffee for you.

01:26:44.011 --> 01:26:46.571
Boys, you realize Mrs. Sloan
has had a very trying time.

01:26:46.747 --> 01:26:48.908
I will let you know
of any further developments.

01:26:49.083 --> 01:26:50.448
We'll take care of everything.

01:26:50.618 --> 01:26:52.643
We'll have an extra
on the street in an hour.

01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.516
- The second you hear news, let me know.
- I will.

01:26:58.359 --> 01:26:59.690
Now, what is this all about?

01:26:59.861 --> 01:27:02.193
Fine time to be asking what it's all about.

01:27:02.363 --> 01:27:05.389
Lucky for you, I prevented the press
from printing the truth...

01:27:05.566 --> 01:27:07.898
...whilst you've been gallivanting about
all night.

01:27:08.069 --> 01:27:09.559
I've been in jail.

01:27:09.737 --> 01:27:12.297
- In jail?
- Your baby.

01:27:12.473 --> 01:27:14.634
- What about my baby?
- It isn't here, dear.

01:27:14.809 --> 01:27:17.437
- Of course it isn't.
- No. I saw it being kidnapped.

01:27:17.612 --> 01:27:19.842
Our baby, the Smart Housekeeping baby.

01:27:20.014 --> 01:27:22.005
- Kidnapped?
- As I came home I saw a woman...

01:27:22.183 --> 01:27:25.641
...in a cloak and hood go out of this house
carrying your baby in her arms.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.414
- Oh, that. Don't get so excited.
- Elizabeth.

01:27:28.589 --> 01:27:31.285
Well, of all the heartless, callous,
irresponsible women...

01:27:31.459 --> 01:27:33.051
...l've ever met in my whole life.

01:27:33.227 --> 01:27:37.129
You can sit there and tell me not to get
excited while your own baby...

01:27:37.298 --> 01:27:39.528
Be careful, Mr. Yardley,
or you'll have a stroke.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.668
This is incredible.

01:27:41.836 --> 01:27:43.701
This is fantastic.

01:27:43.871 --> 01:27:48.240
Here, I believe you to be the finest,
the most exemplary wife and mother.

01:27:48.409 --> 01:27:51.003
Mr. Yardley, if you'd just sit down
and calm yourself...

01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:55.205
of all the brazen, cheap...

01:27:55.383 --> 01:27:59.752
I suppose you've fallen in love with this
young whippersnapper, hero Jones?

01:27:59.921 --> 01:28:05.223
Well, frankly, I... I have.

01:28:07.328 --> 01:28:11.560
So your husband and child
no longer mean anything to you.

01:28:11.732 --> 01:28:13.757
Well, let me tell you something,
Mrs. Sloan.

01:28:13.935 --> 01:28:17.132
If you feel no moral responsibility
towards your husband and child...

01:28:17.305 --> 01:28:19.136
...I have a magazine to protect.

01:28:19.307 --> 01:28:23.073
If you think you can make a mockery
of Yardley Publications, you're mistaken.

01:28:23.244 --> 01:28:24.575
My public believe in you.

01:28:24.745 --> 01:28:28.806
Millions of women in these United States
pattern their daily lives after that feature.

01:28:28.983 --> 01:28:32.111
You'll live up to their ideals,
or my name is not Alexander Yardley!

01:28:32.286 --> 01:28:37.622
But if you'd just let me talk a minute.
You see, John and I were never married.

01:28:37.792 --> 01:28:39.123
Never married?

01:28:39.293 --> 01:28:41.022
Such blatant immorality!

01:28:41.195 --> 01:28:43.561
But you don't understand.
We meant to get married.

01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:45.358
Yes. But we never got around to it.

01:28:45.533 --> 01:28:48.969
You mean to stand there and tell me
the Smart Housekeeping baby is...

01:28:49.136 --> 01:28:51.468
- No. Oh, no.
- Oh, no. No.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.839
Thank heaven, at last.

01:28:54.008 --> 01:28:56.272
- You'll be rewarded, my good woman.
- Good morning.

01:28:56.444 --> 01:28:58.935
Two babies?
Which one is yours, Mrs. Sloan?

01:28:59.113 --> 01:29:00.375
- Hers?
- You make fun.

01:29:00.548 --> 01:29:03.016
- These are our babies.
- Nora. She takes care of them.

01:29:03.184 --> 01:29:06.347
- While we are at the war plant.
- We're on the early shift today.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.080
- Yes, darling. Goodbye.
- Thank you so much.

01:29:09.256 --> 01:29:10.985
Will someone take this...? This...?

01:29:11.158 --> 01:29:12.682
What are you doing to that child?

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:15.488
- What am l...?
- Give it to me.

01:29:15.663 --> 01:29:17.096
The poor little thing.

01:29:17.264 --> 01:29:20.165
- Nora, you'd better take them upstairs.
- Indeed, I will that.

01:29:20.334 --> 01:29:21.995
There now.

01:29:22.169 --> 01:29:23.864
There now.

01:29:24.038 --> 01:29:25.300
The poor things.

01:29:25.773 --> 01:29:28.833
If it's not asking too much,
will you explain?

01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:31.740
It's all very simple.
I have never lived on a farm before.

01:29:31.912 --> 01:29:34.813
- Never lived...?
- No, I have no husband and no baby.

01:29:34.982 --> 01:29:36.472
And she can't cook.

01:29:38.185 --> 01:29:40.881
No husband? No baby?

01:29:41.055 --> 01:29:43.956
Well, of all the dirty, scoundrelly tricks
to play.

01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:47.322
But, Mr. Yardley, we were only trying
to protect the feature for you.

01:29:47.495 --> 01:29:50.555
Do you realize what you've done?
My face will be in all the papers.

01:29:50.731 --> 01:29:53.529
I'll be the laughing stock
of the publishing business.

01:29:55.569 --> 01:29:57.628
Give me the police.

01:30:00.608 --> 01:30:03.668
This is Yardley, Alexander Yardley.

01:30:03.844 --> 01:30:07.610
It was all a mistake. The baby's all right.
There's been no kidnapping.

01:30:07.782 --> 01:30:10.979
I tell you, it was all a mistake.

01:30:14.789 --> 01:30:17.553
As for you, young woman, you're fired.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.453
Now, see what you've done.
Why'd you tell him?

01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:22.857
I didn't. He found out.

01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:26.227
After all I've done to help,
you have to spoil it all. Where were you?

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.961
Well, we were sitting in a sleigh,
and the horse walked off with us.

01:30:30.137 --> 01:30:32.162
A likely story.
First a cow and then a horse.

01:30:32.339 --> 01:30:34.432
- I don't know what to think.
- Think the worst.

01:30:34.608 --> 01:30:36.940
- You always would anyway.
- You're not even sorry...

01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:38.806
...for what you've done.
- No.

01:30:38.979 --> 01:30:40.640
And I think you're glad it happened.

01:30:40.815 --> 01:30:43.340
I must say the way you've
been behaving isn't exactly...

01:30:43.517 --> 01:30:46.418
As the wife of John Sloan,
the eminent architect should behave?

01:30:46.587 --> 01:30:48.384
You've disrupted my household.

01:30:48.556 --> 01:30:50.046
Yes, I have, haven't I?

01:30:50.224 --> 01:30:52.556
You told Yardley that
you were in love with Jones.

01:30:52.727 --> 01:30:56.288
Of course, all that's an absolute lot
of nonsense, but... oh, please.

01:30:56.464 --> 01:30:58.864
- Now, where was I?
- You were throwing me over.

01:30:59.033 --> 01:31:01.695
I cannot afford to incur the enmity
of a man like Yardley.

01:31:01.869 --> 01:31:03.200
Oh, no. Of course you can't.

01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:05.133
I must say you're taking it lightly.

01:31:05.306 --> 01:31:07.672
What do you want me to do?
Weep on your shoulder?

01:31:07.842 --> 01:31:10.936
- I've been through as much as I can stand.
- Don't raise your voice.

01:31:11.112 --> 01:31:12.943
- My nerves won't stand it.
- That's fine.

01:31:13.114 --> 01:31:14.706
That settles it.

01:31:15.483 --> 01:31:17.314
- What's the matter?
- Is something bust?

01:31:17.485 --> 01:31:18.884
Plenty.

01:31:19.053 --> 01:31:20.486
More company.

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:26.085
Does Miss Elizabeth Lane
live here?

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.990
Everybody lives here. Come in.

01:31:29.163 --> 01:31:30.494
Jeffy boy!

01:31:30.664 --> 01:31:32.393
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

01:31:32.566 --> 01:31:33.794
How do you feel?

01:31:33.968 --> 01:31:36.300
Well, just great. I feel great.

01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:38.768
Oh, my, but it's good to see you.

01:31:38.939 --> 01:31:41.373
This is Miss Mary Lee.

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:43.908
Oh, yes, your fiancée.

01:31:44.078 --> 01:31:45.306
Fiancée?

01:31:45.479 --> 01:31:49.677
Yes. Mr. Yardley told me all about it.

01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:52.717
I'm surely delighted to meet you all.

01:31:52.887 --> 01:31:54.218
How do you do?

01:31:54.388 --> 01:31:57.619
It was so sweet of you to have Jeffy boy
out here for Christmas.

01:31:58.492 --> 01:31:59.982
It was a pleasure.

01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:03.460
Oh, Jeffy, I've got so much to tell you.

01:32:03.631 --> 01:32:06.099
About our engagement and everything.

01:32:08.068 --> 01:32:10.229
Why did you come up here at this hour?

01:32:10.404 --> 01:32:13.601
Well, Mr. Yardley phoned for me
to come as a surprise.

01:32:13.774 --> 01:32:15.173
But I was sort of delayed.

01:32:15.342 --> 01:32:18.106
Then I took the wrong train
and landed in Bridgeport.

01:32:18.279 --> 01:32:20.645
I got the milk train back.
It was simply awful.

01:32:20.815 --> 01:32:22.339
There was no diner on it.

01:32:24.318 --> 01:32:26.718
Well, maybe you'd like some breakfast.

01:32:26.887 --> 01:32:29.685
Well, thank you.
I haven't had a bite since last night.

01:32:29.857 --> 01:32:32.052
Felix will fix you some.
I have to pack.

01:32:35.863 --> 01:32:40.300
In case I don't see you again,
Mr. Jones, goodbye.

01:32:40.467 --> 01:32:41.957
I...

01:32:42.136 --> 01:32:44.900
It was certainly an experience
knowing you.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:49.798
- Goodbye, Miss Lee.
- Goodbye, and I'm surely grateful to you.

01:32:53.314 --> 01:32:55.009
I guess I'd better pack too.

01:32:55.182 --> 01:32:56.649
Run along, Jeffy boy.

01:32:56.817 --> 01:32:58.375
I fix Miss Lee.

01:32:58.552 --> 01:33:00.042
I won't be long.

01:33:11.832 --> 01:33:14.630
My, he certainly does look good.

01:33:14.802 --> 01:33:16.133
Fine boy.

01:33:16.303 --> 01:33:18.828
And to think I've got to break his heart.

01:33:19.006 --> 01:33:22.203
- You got to what?
- Break his poor little heart.

01:33:22.376 --> 01:33:23.604
Why do you do that?

01:33:23.777 --> 01:33:25.972
You see, after he left the hospital,
I married.

01:33:26.146 --> 01:33:27.807
You got married?

01:33:27.982 --> 01:33:29.950
I married Sinky.

01:33:30.117 --> 01:33:33.951
You mar... Well, you get married?

01:33:34.121 --> 01:33:35.918
Yes, I married Sinky.

01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:39.924
You... Who is this Stinky?

01:33:40.094 --> 01:33:42.756
His pal.
He was on the raft with Jeffy boy.

01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:44.420
She married!

01:33:44.598 --> 01:33:46.327
Come quick! Come with me!

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:47.831
Quick, come along with me!

01:33:48.002 --> 01:33:49.697
- In here! In here!
- I mean...

01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:51.167
I fix your breakfast.

01:33:53.841 --> 01:33:56.366
I want to have a few words with you,
Mr. Yardley.

01:33:56.543 --> 01:33:58.943
I have nothing more to say, Sloan.
She's fired.

01:33:59.113 --> 01:34:01.547
- Oh, not about that. I mean the contract.
- Contract?

01:34:01.715 --> 01:34:04.616
Yes. The home-planning feature
in Smart Housekeeping.

01:34:04.785 --> 01:34:08.721
- Now, an idea has grown on me...
- oh, that. Well, you'll have to see...

01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:11.614
I'm hungry.

01:34:11.792 --> 01:34:14.192
But, Mr. Yardley.

01:34:15.062 --> 01:34:16.723
Good morning, Felix.

01:34:18.432 --> 01:34:20.900
What a delightful aroma.

01:34:21.068 --> 01:34:22.865
You're a good chef.

01:34:24.838 --> 01:34:27.671
Do I smell kidneys?

01:34:27.841 --> 01:34:29.331
Special for somebody.

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:31.842
But, Felix, I'm famished.
And kidneys...

01:34:32.012 --> 01:34:33.946
Cook your own kidneys.

01:34:34.114 --> 01:34:36.776
I don't cook for somebody
that's not nice to my friends.

01:34:36.951 --> 01:34:39.078
Why, I've done nothing
to your friends, Felix.

01:34:39.253 --> 01:34:41.016
No? You fired Elizabeth.

01:34:41.188 --> 01:34:44.157
- Well, didn't she make a fool of me?
- Pishy-poshy, you done it.

01:34:44.325 --> 01:34:46.020
Nobody can tell you something.

01:34:46.193 --> 01:34:48.991
Sometimes, if you shut up,
maybe you learn something.

01:34:49.163 --> 01:34:51.996
Now, look here, Felix.
I'm not an unreasonable man.

01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:54.396
So then maybe you
don't fire Elizabeth, yes?

01:34:54.568 --> 01:34:56.502
Well, maybe not.

01:34:56.670 --> 01:34:58.831
- Yes or no?
- Well, I don't know...

01:34:59.006 --> 01:35:02.339
...after the way she lied to me.
- She lie? For you she lied.

01:35:02.509 --> 01:35:03.999
Anyway, she got another offer.

01:35:04.178 --> 01:35:06.806
- Another offer?
- Yes.

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:08.778
This came last night.

01:35:08.949 --> 01:35:10.177
I show you.

01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:16.521
I read it to you.

01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:19.784
I can offer contract
with American Housekeeping.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.760
American Housekeeping! Stealing
my people! They won't get away with it.

01:35:23.931 --> 01:35:27.731
- I'll outbid them. I'll give her a big raise.
- No, no, no, no. Wait a minute.

01:35:27.901 --> 01:35:29.266
Cross your heart.

01:35:35.542 --> 01:35:38.602
Kidneys, kidneys, kidneys.

01:35:38.779 --> 01:35:40.371
Please.

01:35:40.547 --> 01:35:42.947
Thank you, Felix. I hope we have
many meals together.

01:35:43.117 --> 01:35:45.244
Any time. At Restaurant Felix.

01:35:45.419 --> 01:35:46.647
No cover charge.

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:53.517
- Having a nice breakfast, Mr. Yardley?
- Yes. Everything is hunky-dunky.

01:35:54.828 --> 01:35:56.489
Very hunky-dunky.

01:35:58.599 --> 01:36:00.965
Jeffy boy, put down the bag.

01:36:01.668 --> 01:36:02.999
Where is everybody?

01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:05.866
Miss Lee is in the den
waiting for breakfast.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.736
But first, I have news for you.
Come, come, come.

01:36:09.877 --> 01:36:12.539
Yes, I'm finished with her.

01:36:12.713 --> 01:36:15.147
- You mean you're not gonna marry her?
- I am not.

01:36:15.315 --> 01:36:16.839
Mr. Yardley, about that contract.

01:36:17.017 --> 01:36:19.247
There's only one contract
that interests me.

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:21.854
The Elizabeth Lane contract
with Smart Housekeeping.

01:36:22.022 --> 01:36:24.684
- You were perfectly right to fire her.
- Fire her?

01:36:24.858 --> 01:36:27.326
I'm not going to fire her.

01:36:27.494 --> 01:36:29.052
I'm going to double her salary.

01:36:40.307 --> 01:36:41.535
- Who is it?
- Yardley.

01:36:41.708 --> 01:36:44.575
- I want to have a few words with you.
- Come in.

01:36:47.648 --> 01:36:48.945
What does he want?

01:36:49.116 --> 01:36:52.347
I don't know. But I know what I want.

01:36:52.519 --> 01:36:54.953
You mean to tell me Lizka
did all this because of me?

01:36:55.122 --> 01:36:58.182
- Positively.
- I've got to talk with her.

01:36:58.358 --> 01:37:01.293
I should wait till the fat man
comes out.

01:37:02.963 --> 01:37:04.294
Listen, my boy...

01:37:04.465 --> 01:37:07.400
So I've come to ask you to reconsider
leaving my employment.

01:37:07.568 --> 01:37:10.036
- As I remember it, you fired me.
- I spoke in temper.

01:37:10.204 --> 01:37:12.365
I want you to stay,
with a big raise, of course.

01:37:12.539 --> 01:37:13.767
A raise?

01:37:13.941 --> 01:37:16.205
I'll double any offer
American Housekeeping make.

01:37:16.376 --> 01:37:19.539
- American Housekeeping?
- Felix told me of their offer.

01:37:19.713 --> 01:37:21.078
Oh, he did, did he?

01:37:21.248 --> 01:37:23.546
You wouldn't want to leave
old Yardley, would you?

01:37:23.717 --> 01:37:25.184
Oh, wouldn't I?

01:37:25.352 --> 01:37:28.185
I'll even give Sloan that contract.

01:37:28.355 --> 01:37:29.617
Well, I'm glad of that.

01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:31.382
He's a bore, but why not marry him?

01:37:31.558 --> 01:37:35.255
Lt'd make a great difference to circulation.
Husband and wife on the same paper.

01:37:35.429 --> 01:37:37.659
I can see the heading
of your next column. Quote:

01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:40.026
"My dear husband now joins me
in my daily work.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.862
Here we are, side by side,
fellow workers in the vineyard.

01:37:43.036 --> 01:37:44.264
- My baby..."
- Unquote.

01:37:44.438 --> 01:37:47.874
- You're a great fixer, aren't you?
- Lf you'll listen to me, you'll find...

01:37:48.041 --> 01:37:50.475
- You listen to me for a change.
- Now, Miss Lane...

01:37:50.644 --> 01:37:53.010
I'm tired of being pushed around,
told what to do!

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.014
Tired of writing your gall-darned articles,
dancing to everybody else's tune!

01:37:57.184 --> 01:38:00.779
Tired of being told whom to marry!
In short, I'm tired.

01:38:00.954 --> 01:38:02.251
- Miss Lane...
- oh, get out.

01:38:02.422 --> 01:38:04.549
- You'll regret this.
- I said, get out!

01:38:04.725 --> 01:38:06.283
Well, really.

01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:12.793
- Most unreasonable woman I've met!
- She's crazy. Even last night...

01:38:12.966 --> 01:38:14.297
Pardon me, gentlemen.

01:38:14.468 --> 01:38:15.958
This is where I take over.

01:38:19.473 --> 01:38:21.304
What does he think he's going to do?

01:38:21.475 --> 01:38:22.840
I give you one guess.

01:38:28.582 --> 01:38:29.844
Don't hear a thing.

01:38:30.017 --> 01:38:31.575
I wonder what's happening?

01:38:33.954 --> 01:38:35.819
- Why did you do that?
- I changed my type.

01:38:35.989 --> 01:38:38.719
- What do you mean?
- I'm the type that kisses married women.

01:38:38.892 --> 01:38:40.917
- And I like it.
- Well, I don't like it.

01:38:41.094 --> 01:38:43.824
- No?
- There's only one thing to do with you.

01:38:43.997 --> 01:38:45.828
- Yes? Let's do it.
- No. No.

01:38:45.999 --> 01:38:48.593
- Now, don't you come near me.
- You attract me, remember?

01:38:48.769 --> 01:38:51.203
- Well, you forget, l...
- oh, no, I don't.

01:38:51.371 --> 01:38:53.805
You're a married woman,
but you don't feel like one.

01:38:53.974 --> 01:38:56.772
- It's not fair.
- There are rules to this game, are there?

01:38:56.944 --> 01:39:00.744
- You must teach me.
- Well, men who are engaged must...

01:39:00.914 --> 01:39:02.643
- Play the game.
- Yes.

01:39:02.816 --> 01:39:04.283
Well, let's play.

01:39:04.451 --> 01:39:06.351
Well...

01:39:06.954 --> 01:39:09.047
- They've stopped talking.
- That's good.

01:39:09.223 --> 01:39:11.555
Have you noticed
the even temperature in this room?

01:39:11.725 --> 01:39:13.317
That's the triple-wall insulation.

01:39:13.493 --> 01:39:14.721
- Oh, shut up.
- Yes.

01:39:17.097 --> 01:39:19.622
- Excuse me.
- Good heavens.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.200
- It's just little me.
- I forget all about you.

01:39:22.369 --> 01:39:24.098
Your breakfast is in the kitchen.

01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:26.739
Won't you join us and wait?

01:39:26.907 --> 01:39:30.035
- What are you waiting for?
- Only Uncle Felix knows.

01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:32.235
Well, I'm powerful hungry.

01:39:32.412 --> 01:39:35.279
- I'll show you where the kitchen is.
- Thank you.

01:39:38.619 --> 01:39:40.780
What...? What...?

01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:45.915
Don't you come near me, you sea wolf.

01:39:46.093 --> 01:39:48.425
- After the way you've deceived me.
- I deceived you?

01:39:48.595 --> 01:39:50.062
- You're engaged.
- You're married.

01:39:50.230 --> 01:39:52.790
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Nor has my engagement.

01:39:52.966 --> 01:39:56.402
- Lf you take another step, I'll scream.
- Go ahead. Scream the house down.

01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:59.767
Perhaps your husband
will come to your rescue.

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.202
I haven't got a husband.

01:40:01.975 --> 01:40:04.409
- You haven't?
- No.

01:40:04.578 --> 01:40:06.102
Then Felix was telling the truth.

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:09.647
- Felix told you?
- Everything.

01:40:09.816 --> 01:40:13.343
- Then you knew all the time?
- Yes.

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.148
I know something you don't know.

01:40:16.323 --> 01:40:17.722
I'm not engaged anymore.

01:40:17.891 --> 01:40:19.256
You're not?

01:40:19.426 --> 01:40:21.917
She married my shipmate.

01:40:22.095 --> 01:40:23.585
She did?

01:40:24.598 --> 01:40:26.463
I'm as free as a bird.

01:40:26.633 --> 01:40:30.899
Oh, that's what you think.

01:40:35.208 --> 01:40:36.573
They've stopped talking.

01:40:36.743 --> 01:40:39.769
- What, again?
- But this time, it's for keeps.

01:40:41.682 --> 01:40:44.173
Now I bring the judge, yes?

01:40:44.351 --> 01:40:45.841
- But definitely.
- Yes, please.

01:40:46.019 --> 01:40:49.216
Well, young man, I suppose
you know what you're doing...

01:40:49.389 --> 01:40:51.289
...but I warn you, she can't cook.

01:40:51.458 --> 01:40:54.825
- She can't cook?
- No, I can't cook.

01:40:54.995 --> 01:40:58.158
She can't cook, but what a wife.

01:40:59.866 --> 01:41:01.766
I hope you'll be very happy.

01:41:01.935 --> 01:41:03.596
Thank you.

01:41:05.172 --> 01:41:07.436
What a Christmas.

01:41:07.774 --> 01:41:09.264
What a Christmas.
