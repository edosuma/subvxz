02:38.159 --> 02:39.869
Mr. Lee says hello.

02:40.787 --> 02:41.454
How kind.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.248
And goodbye too.

02:45.792 --> 02:48.670
- Who are these people?
- Mr. Lee's henchmen!

02:49.671 --> 02:50.463
At last.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.173
We're doomed!

02:52.423 --> 02:53.424
No, they are.

03:22.662 --> 03:23.788
Countess...?

03:26.124 --> 03:28.293
Thank you. You saved my life.

03:28.585 --> 03:30.003
My pleasure.

03:30.295 --> 03:31.504
It almost got bad.

03:32.839 --> 03:35.091
How can I ever thank you?

03:42.974 --> 03:44.726
Your skills are many, Hubert.

03:45.435 --> 03:47.270
I do my duty, Countess.

03:48.438 --> 03:50.899
But from now on, beware of Mr. Lee.

03:51.357 --> 03:53.359
And of Chinamen in general.

03:54.277 --> 03:57.280
They covet
your Imperial family treasures.

03:57.614 --> 03:58.948
Dirty reds!

03:59.115 --> 04:00.325
Dirty yellows!

04:01.367 --> 04:03.119
No, dirty reds.

04:04.537 --> 04:05.997
My mistake.

04:07.624 --> 04:11.419
You don't know China well,
Mr. Bonisseur de la Bath.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.296
Well,

04:13.463 --> 04:16.257
you'll have to show me parts of it.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.135
As private as they may be.

04:36.986 --> 04:41.157
<i>Department of External Archives</i>
<i>and Counter-Intel</i>

04:46.537 --> 04:48.456
- Morning, Fayolle!
- Morning, de la Bath!

04:51.501 --> 04:52.627
Morning, Lutran.

04:52.919 --> 04:54.379
- Hi, Corbier.
- Hi, Hubert.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.880
Morning, de la Bath.

04:56.506 --> 04:57.173
Poulard...

04:58.007 --> 05:00.051
- Morning!
- Morning, de la Bath!

05:01.094 --> 05:03.388
- Good skiing?
- Excellent, Ledentu.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.348
- Can I see the boss?
- Okie-dokie.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.308
That's a good one.

05:07.517 --> 05:08.476
I like that.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.854
Okie-dokie...

05:12.855 --> 05:15.233
Morning, Jean-Pierre.
Great disguise!

05:15.400 --> 05:17.110
- Thank you.
- My pleasure!

05:18.945 --> 05:20.196
Mayeux, Castaing...

05:20.363 --> 05:21.531
Morning, de la Bath.

05:22.949 --> 05:24.158
No news from Picot?

05:24.450 --> 05:26.411
Not a word. Not since Roussel.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.580
- And Lefranc?
- He spoke to Mongier.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.749
What does Borges say?

05:32.375 --> 05:35.461
What can he say?
He agrees with Favre.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.214
And with Duvernois.

05:39.424 --> 05:40.842
I'm off, de la Bath.

05:41.426 --> 05:43.136
Say hello to Granville.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.470
Will do.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.348
In fact, Comolet says hi.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.933
Dear old Bernard.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.103
I saw him last with Charpon,
Labbouze and Delanois.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.896
Francard too. Time flies!

05:54.188 --> 05:55.398
I'll say!

06:01.654 --> 06:04.407
- What are you looking at?
- A blue-print.

06:05.033 --> 06:07.910
For building
a duck-shaped paddle boat.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.787
What's it for?

06:10.663 --> 06:12.623
Same as a normal paddle boat.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.585
Keep an eye on it...

06:15.752 --> 06:16.836
Of course.

06:19.714 --> 06:21.549
I have to see Forguier.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.303
Knock-knock!

06:25.762 --> 06:27.889
The chief is waiting for you.

06:28.056 --> 06:28.890
Thanks, Ledentu.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.234
Morning, Armand.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.988
Good to see you, Hubert.
How was Gstaad?

06:44.363 --> 06:48.910
Well, okie-dokie. Chilly at dawn,
sunny at noon. Great slopes.

06:49.202 --> 06:50.620
Glad to hear it.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.080
A new mission.

06:52.497 --> 06:53.831
Music to my ears!

06:54.373 --> 06:56.417
This is for you.

06:57.043 --> 06:59.921
He is Professor Von Zimmel,
a Nazi dignitary.

07:00.088 --> 07:00.797
Or rather...

07:01.172 --> 07:02.090
he was.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.683
American technology.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.981
His name is now Octavio Pela Luerdo,

07:19.148 --> 07:21.651
a South American
wrestling impresario.

07:21.818 --> 07:22.568
Clever.

07:22.735 --> 07:25.113
He has decided to blackmail France.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.573
- So we stop him?
- No, we pay him.

07:27.740 --> 07:28.658
I'll be damned!

07:28.825 --> 07:32.912
He has a microfilm list
of French collaborators with Nazis.

07:33.079 --> 07:36.749
No surprise it's "micro" film.
The list must be tiny.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.585
Well, it's not that simple, Hubert.

07:40.211 --> 07:43.548
Didn't General de Gaulle say
all France resisted?

07:44.090 --> 07:45.383
He did indeed.

07:47.927 --> 07:49.137
Yes, he did.

07:52.348 --> 07:53.391
Yep...

07:57.603 --> 08:01.607
In any case, you'll go to Rio
and buy the list for 50,000.

08:01.858 --> 08:03.359
- Francs?
- Yes.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.777
Clever.

08:06.279 --> 08:09.991
Why me?
The Postal Service could do it.

08:10.158 --> 08:14.036
I know, Hubert.
But Von Zimmel wants our best agent.

08:14.495 --> 08:17.665
Of course. In that case,
the usual procedure?

08:18.791 --> 08:19.917
Your papers.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.795
You're a reporter
for an evening paper.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.006
Your name is Noël Flantier.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.674
Noël Flantier?

08:28.593 --> 08:30.136
Who picks these names?

08:30.303 --> 08:33.055
Archibald Flétanchard
from Undercover.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.392
Noël Flantier...

08:36.893 --> 08:38.060
I'll send a memo.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.479
Look on the bright side.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.815
Rio de Janeiro is beautiful.

08:42.982 --> 08:44.525
The girls are gorgeous.

08:44.817 --> 08:45.860
You'll relax.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.904
- What?
- You can relax.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.488
Not a word I know.

09:49.340 --> 09:50.758
Taxi, sir?

09:51.509 --> 09:52.718
Why not?

09:52.885 --> 09:54.887
- Where to?
- Copacobana Palace.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.194
Welcome to Rio, sir.

10:10.361 --> 10:11.570
<i>Obrigado!</i>

10:14.615 --> 10:15.783
<i>Obrigado...</i>

10:24.208 --> 10:25.835
This is not the way.

10:31.424 --> 10:32.717
It's an ambush!

10:34.552 --> 10:36.429
Get out! And don't move!

10:45.438 --> 10:47.606
You kill brother in Gsta.

10:47.857 --> 10:49.191
Now die.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.819
Last stop Rio
for O-tet-tet 117.

10:53.904 --> 10:54.572
Pardon me?

10:54.739 --> 10:57.533
You kill brother in Gsta.
Now die.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.161
I'm sorry...

11:00.411 --> 11:02.830
Gsta. Swizzleland. Ski.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.124
Gstaad!

11:06.625 --> 11:07.710
Gsta...

11:07.960 --> 11:09.378
Find my accent funny?

11:09.545 --> 11:10.588
Not at all.

11:10.755 --> 11:12.923
- You racist!
- I swear I'm not!

11:13.090 --> 11:14.633
I lived in Cochinchina!

11:14.800 --> 11:18.012
Farewell O-tet-tet 117, racist.
Now die.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.978
Get in, Hubert.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.730
Bill Trumendous!

11:27.980 --> 11:29.398
Dear old Bill!

11:33.986 --> 11:36.364
- Right in the back!
- See that?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.119
So, good old Hubert?

11:42.286 --> 11:44.372
Trouble with the Chinese?

11:44.580 --> 11:47.875
Not at all.
He mistook me for someone else.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.337
From their perspective,
we look alike.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.762
And you, dear Bill?

11:59.970 --> 12:02.306
South America interests the CIA now?

12:14.151 --> 12:15.569
Good old Hubert!

12:15.903 --> 12:17.947
Same old barrel of laughs.

12:50.855 --> 12:53.190
It's so fucking hot!

12:54.692 --> 12:56.402
Kidding aside...

12:56.944 --> 12:59.864
- Why are you following me?
- You tell me.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.950
Why are you here, bastard?
What's going on?

13:03.117 --> 13:05.578
I'm on vacation. That's all.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.582
I know you, Hubert.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.001
Your presence means trouble.

13:12.168 --> 13:14.920
I'm here for the women
and the beaches.

13:15.129 --> 13:18.424
I've heard great things.
I came to check out Brazilian women.

13:18.591 --> 13:19.216
Whatever!

13:42.656 --> 13:43.949
Thanks, old chap.

13:46.785 --> 13:49.205
If your memory comes back, call me.

13:49.538 --> 13:52.374
I will, if the Tourism Bureau
is closed.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.378
Okay, let's do that then.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.713
Take care, pal.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.501
I'm terribly clumsy.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.128
It would seem that I...

16:01.295 --> 16:02.421
splattered you.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.509
Be my guest.

16:08.344 --> 16:10.846
A woman who splatters a man

16:11.013 --> 16:13.432
is like morning dew in springtime.

16:14.350 --> 16:17.394
Ahead lie beautiful days
and fiery nights.

16:17.811 --> 16:18.687
What a wake-up!

16:19.271 --> 16:20.439
I'm for nothing.

16:20.606 --> 16:24.568
The hardy arrogance of your beauty
has sprayed me.

16:32.785 --> 16:34.536
You're gorgeous, Mr...

16:36.955 --> 16:39.792
Flantier. Noël Flantier.
Reporter.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.752
My pleasure<i>. Carlotta.</i>

16:41.919 --> 16:43.170
Reporting on what?

16:43.462 --> 16:44.463
Brazil.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.424
Vast subject.
You need an angle of attack.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.343
I'm currently searching.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.181
Magnificent. Do you exercise?

16:54.765 --> 16:55.849
Not even.

16:57.017 --> 16:57.935
Superb.

16:58.227 --> 17:00.104
I have a good pedigree.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.274
Let me slip into something
more comfy.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.619
I'll also be slipping
into something comfy.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.438
Carlotta?

17:53.657 --> 17:55.993
Who'd want to harm Carlotta?

18:04.126 --> 18:05.127
<i>Mr. Bonisseur de la Bath?</i>

18:05.586 --> 18:07.004
No, Flantier.

18:13.218 --> 18:17.055
<i>For the microfilm, bring the money</i>
<i>to the look-out point.</i>

18:17.222 --> 18:18.849
You'll recognize us.

20:40.324 --> 20:40.949
Get in!

21:06.558 --> 21:08.310
Keep calm, double-one seven.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.145
Delightful voyage.

21:24.117 --> 21:28.497
Sorry to appear rude.
We needed a calm spot, double-one 7.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.332
One-seventeen.

21:30.499 --> 21:33.293
But the name is Flantier.
Mr. Flantier.

21:34.795 --> 21:36.296
I'm Colonel Staman.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.714
This is Colonel Kutner.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.174
My pleasure. Noël Flantier.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.468
I'm doing an article on Brazil.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.428
Don't bother.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.931
We know why you're here,
double-one 7.

21:46.098 --> 21:46.974
One-seventeen.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.309
We want the same man.

21:49.768 --> 21:50.435
Go on.

21:50.769 --> 21:52.145
Professor Von Zimmel.

21:52.562 --> 21:53.855
- Go on.
- Enough.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.857
Will you work with the Mossad?

21:56.066 --> 21:56.775
Go on.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.112
It's your turn.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.241
Will you work with the Mossad?

22:04.574 --> 22:06.118
- The...?
- Mossad.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.411
Israeli Secret Service.

22:10.914 --> 22:14.459
Hunt down a Nazi with Jews?
How strange!

22:15.794 --> 22:16.712
Why?

22:17.212 --> 22:18.380
He'll recognize them.

22:18.755 --> 22:19.381
How so?

22:20.257 --> 22:21.883
Their noses, obviously...

22:23.218 --> 22:25.137
Their ears, fingers,

22:25.387 --> 22:26.430
their eyes.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.938
I didn't mean anything...

22:35.272 --> 22:37.107
You're France's best agent?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.151
I mean...

22:39.317 --> 22:43.071
"The best"...
It's not for me to say.

22:43.822 --> 22:46.033
And as I often say...

22:50.620 --> 22:53.665
Mr. 717, this is Dolores Kuleshov.

22:53.915 --> 22:56.251
You'll team up with her.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.574
Thrilled to meet you.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.493
It's an honor, OSS 117.

23:30.869 --> 23:34.081
Your fight against Nazi barbarism
is world-renown.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.459
Our teachers wax poetic
about your exploits.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.462
For many of us, you're a legend.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.006
A true remedy against savagery.

23:43.173 --> 23:46.093
I must tell you
you're a symbol of liberty.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.928
I am moved and honored

23:48.095 --> 23:50.263
to work with you, OSS 117.

23:52.974 --> 23:54.768
Such a pretty secretary!

23:55.143 --> 23:55.936
Excuse me?

23:56.228 --> 23:58.730
I'm happy to have a pretty secretary.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.733
I'm not your secretary.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.528
Whose, then?

24:05.946 --> 24:07.280
No one's.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.825
I'm a colonel in the Israeli army.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.120
We'll be working together, as equals.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.124
Tell me when you have
to carry something heavy.

24:24.131 --> 24:26.967
You can spend the night here.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.594
Your assailants won't find you.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.390
The microfilm is of no interest
to us.

24:33.557 --> 24:34.891
We want Von Zimmel.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.143
I understand.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.687
- Remember Eichmann?
- Of course.

24:39.187 --> 24:42.315
We'll capture Von Zimmel
the same way.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.901
Judge him in Israel for his crimes.

24:45.861 --> 24:46.820
Which are...?

24:47.279 --> 24:48.280
Which are...

24:49.656 --> 24:50.907
Abetting genocide.

24:51.158 --> 24:52.868
Oh that! Yeah...

24:54.327 --> 24:55.912
That was some story.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.260
We'll search together.

25:10.427 --> 25:13.054
You get the microfilm,
we get the man.

25:13.221 --> 25:14.806
It'll be just you two.

25:15.182 --> 25:15.891
Excellent.

25:16.308 --> 25:18.268
We're leaving for Tel Aviv.

25:18.435 --> 25:21.605
Officially,
we've never even heard of you.

25:21.771 --> 25:22.689
Clever.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.733
- Leave the money here.
- I can't.

25:25.066 --> 25:28.778
It belongs to France.
I can't leave it with just anyone.

25:31.323 --> 25:34.117
Don't take "just anyone" personally.

25:34.326 --> 25:38.705
Don't think I believe what they say
about... Jews and money.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.040
It's not the case.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.920
- Want to see your room?
- Yes!

25:54.512 --> 25:55.889
Pajamas, toothbrush.

25:56.264 --> 25:59.017
Thanks, I'll only use the toothbrush.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.937
Do as you please. Goodnight.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.985
Thanks for the toothbrush.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.403
You're welcome.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.784
- Goodnight.
- Night, guys.

26:26.544 --> 26:27.879
Nice night, isn't it?

26:31.591 --> 26:34.678
I'm sorry for before.
I was terribly clumsy.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.472
Don't worry.
I'll atone for my sins.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.266
Consider it forgotten.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.060
I realize that I was...

26:42.352 --> 26:43.603
Anti-Semitic?

26:45.814 --> 26:47.524
I was thinking "clumsy".

26:47.691 --> 26:48.775
Same difference.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.277
Don't worry.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.529
You weren't speaking viciously.

26:52.696 --> 26:57.158
We're used to it. Our people
have always provoked wild fantasies.

26:57.325 --> 26:59.119
Thanks for admitting it.

26:59.536 --> 27:02.414
You're obviously
a little bit responsible.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.002
<i>Don't get angry. We need him.</i>

27:07.168 --> 27:09.212
<i>I'll do what I can, sir.</i>

27:12.465 --> 27:13.675
Goodnight to you too.

27:19.472 --> 27:22.225
Let's begin at the Copacabana Palace.

27:22.392 --> 27:25.395
I'll get some stuff
and leave my briefcase.

27:25.562 --> 27:28.189
Fine. I'll start working on my own.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.482
That's too bad.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.526
Why not come see the hotel?

27:32.110 --> 27:34.571
Thanks but I'd rather get working.

27:34.738 --> 27:37.157
Don't be silly. There's a pool.

27:37.324 --> 27:40.160
We'll start this afternoon
with a bang.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.579
Thank you, I'd rather not.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.289
Let's meet at 1 p.m.

27:44.456 --> 27:45.749
As you wish.

27:46.541 --> 27:47.834
See you shortly.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.855
You kill brother in Gstaad.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.023
Excuse me?

28:10.398 --> 28:13.109
Say bye-bye to Rio, OSS 117.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.612
Herr Flantier?

28:18.114 --> 28:19.741
Follow us, Herr Flantier.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.101
Great to see you again.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.354
We haven't spoken since Gstaad.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.481
I wanted to thank you.

28:51.689 --> 28:52.899
Excellent mission.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.651
Very pleasant.

28:57.695 --> 29:01.199
Don't be upset
I couldn't kill all those Chinks.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.076
I'm sorry.

29:04.119 --> 29:07.038
I know you hate those rice-eaters.

29:11.126 --> 29:13.920
Very stubborn, those litchi-faces.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.924
Those grapefruit heads.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.637
Sturdy, those prune skins.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.225
Pineapple hearts.

29:29.436 --> 29:31.146
Lemon wedges.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.900
Bananas flambé.

29:36.401 --> 29:37.944
Before they get lit.

29:38.695 --> 29:39.904
Just bananas!

29:43.450 --> 29:44.868
I get off here.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.378
The Germans.

29:56.087 --> 29:57.130
Yes, the Germans!

30:09.559 --> 30:12.020
Would it be possible, if it exists,

30:12.187 --> 30:16.107
to consult a list of former Nazis
residing in Brazil?

30:19.986 --> 30:21.404
There must be a...

30:21.779 --> 30:26.075
society of former Nazis?
A club, an association?

30:28.912 --> 30:30.371
A Nazi Guild?

30:30.538 --> 30:32.582
Germany is a democracy.

30:32.749 --> 30:36.794
In no way does the Embassy
know the whereabouts of Nazis.

30:37.462 --> 30:39.214
Among fellow Germans...

30:39.464 --> 30:41.174
All Germans are not Nazis.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.802
I've heard that theory.

30:44.969 --> 30:47.305
I must ask you to leave.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.932
Very well.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.267
Empty-handed, alas.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.358
France is the country of 400 cheeses.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.360
What's cheese in Brazilian?

31:03.404 --> 31:05.448
Are you okay? Is all well?

31:06.699 --> 31:08.910
So? Have you made progress?

31:11.996 --> 31:13.873
Be my guest. You first.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.710
I may be a secret agent,
but I'm French nonetheless.

31:19.254 --> 31:21.673
I think I've done some good work.

31:21.923 --> 31:25.260
The CIA has been in contact
with Von Zimmel.

31:25.677 --> 31:28.221
Their agent in Rio
is Bill Trumendous.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.310
Bravo! I'm very impressed.

31:34.477 --> 31:36.396
We've reached similar ends.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.440
With a slight advantage for me.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.401
Mr. Trumendous' card.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.171
Good old Hubert!

32:04.882 --> 32:08.428
You always have the cutest dolls
by your side.

32:08.970 --> 32:09.887
Dear old Bill!

32:10.054 --> 32:13.683
You take every little bird
under your wing!

32:16.102 --> 32:18.021
- Too darn hot!
- Sure is!

32:20.023 --> 32:22.317
Wendy, bring us 3 Groovy Coconuts.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.236
Shorten those skirts.
They make me hot.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.948
Brazil is a mysterious country.

32:29.574 --> 32:31.117
People appear and disappear.

32:32.493 --> 32:35.496
After 20 years here,
there must be a trace.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.088
Maybe so...

32:44.464 --> 32:46.424
but I don't know.

32:46.924 --> 32:48.134
Maybe what?

32:48.426 --> 32:51.262
His son Heinrich is here in Rio.

32:51.721 --> 32:54.307
I seem to remember
he lives in a <i>favela.</i>

32:54.891 --> 32:57.310
He was involved in hippie sects.

32:57.852 --> 32:59.354
- What?
- Hippie sects.

33:00.563 --> 33:01.981
Good God.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.484
Sex with horses...

33:05.526 --> 33:07.028
What next?

33:07.195 --> 33:08.988
Hippie sects.

33:10.198 --> 33:12.158
Because hippic sex...

33:12.367 --> 33:13.159
Hold on.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.286
I may have a picture.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.665
This is Heinrich Von Zimmel.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.710
That hair!

33:24.128 --> 33:25.588
Why look like a girl?

33:26.547 --> 33:27.173
Unusual.

33:28.466 --> 33:29.509
What do they want?

33:32.178 --> 33:34.180
It's a form of protest.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.890
To change the world.

33:39.227 --> 33:40.603
Change the world?

33:41.562 --> 33:42.897
What a strange idea.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.024
The world's fine. Why change it?

33:46.984 --> 33:49.445
They want to make love, not war.

33:49.612 --> 33:51.114
But both are possible.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.534
I've always done both.
So far, no complaints!

33:58.329 --> 33:59.497
Good old Hubert!

34:00.957 --> 34:02.250
You too!

34:04.585 --> 34:06.170
Come on...

34:06.504 --> 34:08.131
No sense of humor!

34:08.297 --> 34:11.968
Everyone talks about Jewish humor.
It's not too funny!

34:13.469 --> 34:15.138
No, it's not too funny.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.517
Really?

34:21.102 --> 34:23.062
How can it be humor then?

34:23.563 --> 34:24.772
You pull it off.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.023
In your own way.

34:28.609 --> 34:29.777
Indeed.

34:36.576 --> 34:37.910
This city is stunning.

34:41.706 --> 34:42.999
And I know cities.

34:44.459 --> 34:48.087
How do they manage
to keep their shoes clean?

34:48.254 --> 34:50.298
They don't have shoes.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.593
Good one! No shoes!

34:53.760 --> 34:55.219
Not bad!

34:55.762 --> 34:58.097
Life here isn't easy for everyone.

34:58.389 --> 35:00.141
As in most dictatorships.

35:00.308 --> 35:02.101
Dictatorships! Listen to you!

35:02.518 --> 35:05.646
You're sweet,
but spare me your politics.

35:07.023 --> 35:09.192
You know what a dictatorship is?

35:09.567 --> 35:11.068
People are communists.

35:11.235 --> 35:15.448
They're cold, with gray hats
and boots with zippers.

35:15.698 --> 35:17.241
That's a dictatorship.

35:17.408 --> 35:21.078
What do you call a country
with a military leader,

35:21.245 --> 35:24.290
secret police, one TV station
and censorship?

35:24.707 --> 35:26.584
I call that France, Miss.

35:26.751 --> 35:29.212
Not any France: De Gaulle's France.

35:37.428 --> 35:38.471
I think it's here.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.017
Where is Heinrich Von Zimmel?

35:45.269 --> 35:47.438
I'll ask again.
Where is Von Zimmel?

35:47.605 --> 35:49.816
And put that transistor down.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.109
Stupid kid!

35:52.276 --> 35:53.653
Allow me.

36:16.384 --> 36:17.927
The hippies left.

36:18.094 --> 36:19.762
They're on a beach nearby.

36:19.929 --> 36:21.305
Okay, let's go.

36:22.849 --> 36:23.474
Goodbye.

36:26.394 --> 36:27.728
So long, kids.

36:32.984 --> 36:35.278
I saw you talking to that girl.

36:35.444 --> 36:36.863
Know what I thought?

36:37.029 --> 36:39.156
You're made to have children.

36:39.448 --> 36:43.160
This dangerous job is not for you.
You need a home.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.663
Kids that you can shower with love.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.417
It's a compliment I rarely give
but...

36:50.126 --> 36:52.128
you're a natural-born mother.

36:52.545 --> 36:53.713
Can I ask something?

36:55.006 --> 36:55.673
Of course.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.884
Would you say this to a man?

36:58.843 --> 37:00.720
You know, men are rarely...

37:03.973 --> 37:05.516
mothers.

37:12.899 --> 37:14.734
Heinrich Von Zimmel.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.903
Here's my plan.
Simple and efficient.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.571
See that rock?

37:19.196 --> 37:20.531
Bring the kid there.

37:20.698 --> 37:23.284
Use your feminine wiles if necessary.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.787
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

37:37.340 --> 37:40.509
We're reporters. We want your father.
Where is he?

37:40.676 --> 37:43.220
- This wasn't my plan.
- No, it's mine.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.848
Tell me or I'll blow your brains out.

37:46.015 --> 37:47.433
I have no idea!

37:47.600 --> 37:49.977
- Not good enough!
- For me neither!

37:52.438 --> 37:54.523
I want to help, I promise!

37:55.024 --> 37:59.779
I can find his former partner.
We'll go to him in Brasilia.

38:02.365 --> 38:04.700
I'll help you arrest him.

38:07.161 --> 38:09.080
I hate my father. He's a Nazi.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.998
He's a bastard.

38:12.750 --> 38:13.834
I'm ashamed.

38:17.838 --> 38:20.466
Don't badmouth your father!
Shame on you!

38:20.633 --> 38:21.592
Who brought you up?

38:21.884 --> 38:24.220
I never badmouthed my father!

38:25.012 --> 38:28.140
He was a wheelwright.
And we toed the line.

38:28.432 --> 38:31.310
Mother never complained.
Neither did we!

38:31.894 --> 38:33.187
His father was a Nazi.

38:33.437 --> 38:36.399
Maybe.
But it was his father all the same.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.987
Tell me...
Your father was a wheelwright?

38:41.153 --> 38:42.697
No, a diplomat.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.366
I used psychological torture.

38:47.410 --> 38:49.203
But he'd already talked.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.413
Yes...

38:50.746 --> 38:53.332
but it's that systematic denigration.

38:53.499 --> 38:56.002
The parents, the family, then it's...

38:56.293 --> 38:58.337
the flag, the nation.

38:59.213 --> 39:00.881
But his father was SS!

39:01.048 --> 39:02.466
A Nazi.

39:02.675 --> 39:05.720
Not the same thing.
Not all Nazis were SS.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.888
Don't generalize.

39:08.639 --> 39:10.057
You can eat here.

39:10.391 --> 39:11.642
- Yes!
- No thanks.

39:11.809 --> 39:12.685
We have to go.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.186
As you wish.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.318
Why not split up?

39:21.485 --> 39:23.446
So you can keep an eye on him.

39:25.906 --> 39:27.616
- Is that better?
- Maybe.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.412
Are you trying to ditch me?

39:31.579 --> 39:32.496
Not at all.

39:35.708 --> 39:38.878
I'm kidding, Dolores.
Why would you?

39:57.271 --> 39:59.440
- Do you do quiche?
- What?

40:00.191 --> 40:01.484
Quiche Lorraine.

40:09.784 --> 40:10.493
What is it?

40:10.659 --> 40:12.870
- LSD.
- Excellent.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.582
I closed the shutter.
With 200 ASA, this light...

40:18.125 --> 40:19.126
is fine.

40:23.422 --> 40:24.465
Change the world!

40:24.632 --> 40:27.927
You're nice but...
everyone has to wake up.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.472
The world won't wait.
The world is moving.

40:31.764 --> 40:35.392
Moving fast.
You'll be left high and dry.

40:35.976 --> 40:38.479
What happens after summer vacation?

40:38.979 --> 40:40.397
We're not on vacation.

40:40.564 --> 40:41.857
Okay, fair enough.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.068
You're on sabbatical.

40:44.235 --> 40:45.569
What about next year?

40:46.320 --> 40:47.571
Thought about that?

40:48.364 --> 40:50.282
The world won't bend to you.

40:50.533 --> 40:52.868
This isn't 1968, Year of Youth!

40:53.661 --> 40:55.162
That's not how it works.

40:55.621 --> 40:59.041
It's the real world out there.
The real world gets hair cuts.

41:00.543 --> 41:03.587
Guitars and troubadours
are dead and gone.

41:03.754 --> 41:05.381
I have my own.

41:12.429 --> 41:13.722
What was I saying?

41:13.889 --> 41:15.432
Dead troubadours.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.059
That's right.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.103
What about them?

41:19.603 --> 41:21.021
I can't remember.

41:21.188 --> 41:23.440
Don't say that. You disappoint me.

41:23.858 --> 41:26.026
I had to be saying something...

43:42.371 --> 43:43.914
I like what's happening.

43:44.081 --> 43:47.501
But understand...
it's our secret and ours alone.

43:49.753 --> 43:52.965
No one has to know any of this.

43:53.132 --> 43:55.759
Out of context,
a finger up the butt...

43:58.804 --> 44:00.681
Let's clear this up.

44:00.848 --> 44:02.808
People can get the wrong idea.

44:02.975 --> 44:04.852
They start imagining things...

44:22.119 --> 44:22.911
Strange.

44:26.081 --> 44:27.291
Unusual route.

44:29.001 --> 44:30.669
How did it go last night?

44:31.295 --> 44:34.173
Excellent.
I spent a very relaxing evening.

44:34.340 --> 44:37.634
We ate. I took some RSVP
and slept like a baby.

44:37.801 --> 44:38.927
Lovely.

44:39.553 --> 44:41.764
Those hippies are actually nice.

44:42.598 --> 44:44.767
Once you get past their hygiene.

44:45.059 --> 44:46.810
What can I say?

44:47.519 --> 44:48.729
It's youth...

44:49.021 --> 44:51.815
Sooner or later,
reality will cut their hair.

44:56.445 --> 44:58.322
Dolores, I've been meaning...

44:58.989 --> 45:00.074
Freeze!

45:02.326 --> 45:04.161
You kill brother at Gsta.

45:04.912 --> 45:05.913
Now die.

45:08.290 --> 45:09.583
What does he want?

45:09.750 --> 45:11.001
How should I know?

45:13.337 --> 45:16.590
This plane is now your coffin,
OSS 117!

45:25.140 --> 45:25.974
Locked.

45:26.975 --> 45:27.893
And with a key.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.270
Compliments of Mr. Lee!

45:35.609 --> 45:37.569
Got a broach or a knitting needle?

45:40.030 --> 45:41.240
How about a key?

45:45.202 --> 45:46.954
A safety pin?

45:47.121 --> 45:48.872
- Bra buckle?
- I'm bra-less.

45:51.667 --> 45:53.377
I have a hairpin!

45:57.840 --> 45:59.049
Hurry, Hubert!

46:11.437 --> 46:12.813
Why don't you have one?

46:13.105 --> 46:14.648
- One what?
- A bra.

46:14.815 --> 46:15.858
- Because.
- Why?

46:16.024 --> 46:18.735
It's my body
and this isn't the moment!

46:21.238 --> 46:23.073
Why look like a man?

46:23.365 --> 46:24.575
Unusual.

46:25.367 --> 46:26.118
Open!

46:29.830 --> 46:30.622
How's it going?

46:30.789 --> 46:32.666
Fine. We're losing altitude,

46:32.833 --> 46:36.170
aiming for the trees,
and no landing gear.

46:36.336 --> 46:37.546
So what's fine?

46:38.172 --> 46:39.256
Well, I'm here.

46:39.590 --> 46:40.340
My God!

46:40.549 --> 46:41.175
Thank you.

46:46.096 --> 46:46.972
Almost there?

47:01.111 --> 47:03.864
Hurry, it's on fire!
It's going to blow!

47:23.967 --> 47:25.177
Thanks, Noël.

47:25.344 --> 47:26.970
- No problem.
- Good work.

47:27.346 --> 47:29.515
I'm intrigued by that Chinaman.

47:29.681 --> 47:31.808
He can't work for Von Zimmel.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.352
He might...

47:34.853 --> 47:37.606
Which Chinese worked with the Nazis?

47:38.315 --> 47:39.650
The Japanese?

47:40.150 --> 47:42.819
The Japanese, exactly.
My mistake.

47:43.445 --> 47:45.030
I had a vague theory.

47:45.197 --> 47:47.783
Chinamen from China
don't fit into it.

48:09.304 --> 48:11.390
I wanted to thank you again.

48:11.557 --> 48:13.892
I'm proud to team up with you.

48:14.351 --> 48:15.602
I understand.

48:16.478 --> 48:18.438
By the way, I meant to say...

48:19.523 --> 48:22.651
I know how much
you admire me, my career,

48:22.818 --> 48:26.280
my life, my profession,
my crusade against barbarism.

48:27.114 --> 48:28.865
Alas, it has a price.

48:29.199 --> 48:31.451
Dolores, I'll be brutally honest.

48:32.244 --> 48:34.788
If ever anything happens
between us...

48:37.958 --> 48:40.210
I can't commit to women.

48:41.962 --> 48:45.007
My love affairs aren't long-term.
They're...

48:45.716 --> 48:47.843
short, compact, passionate.

48:49.177 --> 48:50.929
It's my modus operandi.

48:52.347 --> 48:54.349
Some people have adventures.

48:55.183 --> 48:56.310
I am an adventure.

48:57.269 --> 48:58.854
I just had to tell you.

49:00.314 --> 49:01.898
It's very kind of you.

49:02.274 --> 49:02.899
Thanks, Hubert.

49:04.610 --> 49:05.944
You're welcome.

49:07.362 --> 49:08.822
You're very kind.

49:11.241 --> 49:12.618
What's wrong?

49:13.243 --> 49:14.494
Nothing.

49:15.078 --> 49:16.872
- You don't like men.
- Yes, why?

49:17.289 --> 49:18.790
You rebuffed me as if...

49:18.957 --> 49:19.958
Drop it, Hubert.

49:22.085 --> 49:23.295
Because I'm not Jewish?

49:24.087 --> 49:27.215
- Why do you say that?
- Your religion is so...

49:27.382 --> 49:28.425
So what?

49:28.675 --> 49:31.303
It's a religion
that forbids sausages.

49:31.470 --> 49:32.512
And?

49:33.639 --> 49:34.973
And nothing.

49:35.390 --> 49:37.392
Let's pretend that's normal.

49:37.559 --> 49:39.978
No sausages, no alcohol,
veiled women.

49:40.437 --> 49:41.730
Sorry it's sort of...

49:41.897 --> 49:42.564
Sort of?

49:44.816 --> 49:47.694
Sort of "Simon says, no sausages!"
Isn't it?

49:47.861 --> 49:49.237
No, it isn't.

49:49.780 --> 49:53.408
- You're confusing Jews and Muslims.
- Don't nitpick, Dolores.

49:53.784 --> 49:56.620
Between us,
that's what annoys people.

49:56.787 --> 49:59.623
The attitude
"I'm a Jew, I know everything."

49:59.790 --> 50:02.793
Sorry if I upset you
but I won't apologize.

50:03.335 --> 50:06.254
Your theories on Jews,
blacks and women

50:06.421 --> 50:08.674
would be best kept to yourself.

50:12.302 --> 50:14.054
You're the one who's upset.

50:32.030 --> 50:34.408
<i>- Can we cross it?
- Negative.</i>

50:34.658 --> 50:36.368
It's a crocodile river.

50:36.702 --> 50:38.078
Too far to swim.

50:38.495 --> 50:40.080
We have to cross it.

50:40.372 --> 50:42.833
Yes, but for the moment we're stuck.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.835
We can't cross it yet.

50:45.252 --> 50:48.797
Since we can't avoid the crocodiles,
we'll set up camp.

50:48.964 --> 50:49.798
Any objections?

50:50.966 --> 50:51.717
None.

50:53.677 --> 50:55.470
It's pretty here.

50:56.138 --> 50:57.723
We'll spend the night.

50:58.974 --> 51:00.767
This is what we'll do.

51:00.934 --> 51:02.227
I'll hunt.

51:02.519 --> 51:04.730
Heinrich,
I'd appreciate if you cut wood.

51:05.939 --> 51:08.150
Dolores, be nice.
Set us up a table.

51:08.316 --> 51:09.776
Something cute.

51:12.863 --> 51:13.697
What now?

51:13.864 --> 51:15.741
I'm taking a dip. To wash.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.416
He'll get tons of germs, that's all.

51:30.464 --> 51:33.884
See, Noël?
Maybe this is what it means...

51:34.760 --> 51:35.844
Change the world!

51:40.098 --> 51:41.433
Watch out!

51:46.605 --> 51:48.440
Thanks, I'll never forget it.

51:48.607 --> 51:49.441
My pleasure!

51:49.608 --> 51:52.527
- Now we're friends forever.
- Deal!

51:52.694 --> 51:56.198
Next time you change the world,
watch out for crocodiles.

51:57.324 --> 51:59.367
Ask whatever you want of me.

52:05.332 --> 52:07.250
Start by wearing underwear.

52:17.344 --> 52:18.678
Who's laughing now?

52:19.346 --> 52:21.515
Here, Dolores.
Make us dinner.

52:22.057 --> 52:24.476
What should I do? It weighs a ton.

52:25.268 --> 52:27.938
I don't know. Just something simple.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.272
No one's judging.

52:29.564 --> 52:31.316
Judging what?

52:31.817 --> 52:35.904
I won't cook or set a table.
You judge women by their food?

52:36.863 --> 52:38.281
Listen, little lady.

52:39.533 --> 52:41.201
I did my job.

52:41.409 --> 52:42.869
I saved your lives.

52:43.245 --> 52:44.955
I just killed a crocodile.

52:45.288 --> 52:47.666
Want to be equals? Start working.

52:47.833 --> 52:49.751
You can at least make dinner.

52:49.918 --> 52:52.087
She's right. We won't eat that.

52:52.254 --> 52:53.463
She's right?

52:53.755 --> 52:55.465
No need for drama.

52:56.800 --> 52:59.052
Your world sure is changing fast.

52:59.344 --> 53:01.304
I'll get dinner.

53:01.471 --> 53:03.974
I saw some berries up there.

53:05.016 --> 53:06.518
I'll join you!

53:07.644 --> 53:08.854
It figures.

53:24.286 --> 53:27.038
You don't want any fruit?
It's very good.

53:27.289 --> 53:30.083
No thanks. I need my vitamins.

53:30.250 --> 53:31.251
That's silly.

53:32.627 --> 53:33.628
Of course.

53:34.296 --> 53:35.964
I'm the silly one.

53:43.847 --> 53:45.682
This thing doesn't cook.

53:47.100 --> 53:48.935
Why doesn't it cook?

54:02.908 --> 54:04.993
- Is it cooking?
- Slowly.

54:05.452 --> 54:08.747
Crocodile skin is slow to roast.
No big deal.

54:09.122 --> 54:10.373
What do you want?

54:10.707 --> 54:12.208
I want to make peace.

54:13.001 --> 54:14.920
We're very tired.

54:15.462 --> 54:17.422
We should stick together.

54:17.672 --> 54:19.549
Why not ask Heinrich?

54:20.175 --> 54:23.219
You're so close.
He'd love to stick to you.

54:23.386 --> 54:24.971
Why are you like this?

54:25.430 --> 54:28.350
Maybe I just dislike
seeing an Israeli colonel

54:28.516 --> 54:30.518
flirting with a Nazi's son.

54:31.895 --> 54:33.438
Sorry, I have morals.

54:34.022 --> 54:34.981
Pathetic!

54:39.986 --> 54:41.321
Very funny! Bravo!

55:12.352 --> 55:14.396
Brasilia! We're finally here!

55:14.562 --> 55:17.065
Thank God we crossed that river!

55:17.232 --> 55:19.776
Good thing you can build pedal boats!

55:21.319 --> 55:23.780
I said I'm sorry for the duck head.

55:24.823 --> 55:27.367
It would have taken a lot longer.

55:27.534 --> 55:29.577
It would not have!

55:30.870 --> 55:33.415
The boat's the hard part,
not the duck.

55:33.581 --> 55:36.710
The duck's a beak and a head.
Forget about it.

55:38.253 --> 55:40.338
Now we need to find a hotel.

55:42.507 --> 55:43.967
Consider it done.

55:48.763 --> 55:52.350
I spoke to Father's partner.
He's throwing a party.

55:53.101 --> 55:54.853
But it's a costume ball.

55:55.061 --> 55:56.730
That is a problem.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.860
Unless we wear costumes.
Might be fun.

56:02.027 --> 56:02.986
Very.

56:03.153 --> 56:05.613
- But we're here to work.
- Of course.

56:17.292 --> 56:19.335
Time to get to work.

56:19.502 --> 56:22.380
Let's meet in half an hour.
In costume.

56:23.214 --> 56:26.134
Don't worry about the drinks.
My treat.

56:48.573 --> 56:50.116
How did you do that?

56:51.242 --> 56:52.577
I sew.

56:53.536 --> 56:54.913
By the way, here.

56:55.330 --> 56:55.997
For you.

56:56.414 --> 56:59.209
I want a truce.
Our countries are allies.

56:59.751 --> 57:02.087
- Let's try harder.
- You're right.

57:03.713 --> 57:05.632
A present.

57:06.007 --> 57:07.383
From "Noël".

57:10.470 --> 57:12.514
A pun on "Christmas present".

57:13.473 --> 57:14.724
Concerning my name.

57:14.891 --> 57:16.643
I'd understood.

57:17.644 --> 57:18.728
Otherwise...

57:20.814 --> 57:22.398
I have the balls.

57:24.234 --> 57:25.985
<i>- Christmas balls?
- Yes!</i>

57:35.870 --> 57:37.455
Come on, it's funny.

57:37.622 --> 57:38.414
Enough.

57:42.252 --> 57:44.129
I have to tell Armand.

57:48.341 --> 57:49.717
I just thought of it.

57:49.884 --> 57:53.471
I remembered my name was Noël
and it popped out.

57:53.638 --> 57:55.098
Christmas balls!

57:55.265 --> 57:57.684
I think I showed her my package!

58:00.895 --> 58:03.606
I said to myself:
"That's for Armand!"

58:05.984 --> 58:07.861
I have to go. I see a Nazi.

58:08.027 --> 58:10.155
It's Heinrich. My friend.

58:10.321 --> 58:11.239
I'll call you back.

58:16.202 --> 58:17.537
It's not too...?

58:17.704 --> 58:19.372
No, it's fine. Just fine.

58:19.539 --> 58:22.959
It's all they had left
at the rental place.

58:24.252 --> 58:26.713
Okay, it's a rental. It figures.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.339
Now I get it.

58:35.263 --> 58:36.931
I added this.

58:38.433 --> 58:40.018
A peace symbol.

58:40.977 --> 58:43.688
You see? Still our little Heinrich.

58:44.689 --> 58:46.524
No reason to sulk.

58:46.691 --> 58:48.943
It's just a Nazi costume.

58:55.575 --> 58:57.327
It's because she's Jewish.

59:11.633 --> 59:12.842
Here we are.

59:15.762 --> 59:16.721
I smell a trap.

59:16.888 --> 59:19.474
Not so sure. Don't be paranoid.

59:19.641 --> 59:22.310
- Maybe they had the same idea.
- Probably.

59:22.477 --> 59:25.396
Or they rented
from the same place as Heinrich.

59:25.688 --> 59:28.107
Possible... but hard to believe.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.789
I'll find Father's partner.

59:54.717 --> 59:56.886
Dolores, I owe you an apology.

59:57.053 --> 59:59.764
You may be right.
This could be a trap.

59:59.931 --> 1:00:01.182
No kidding.

1:00:01.849 --> 1:00:04.894
Come... Let's try to blend in.

1:00:10.566 --> 1:00:12.568
Got an escape plan?

1:00:12.902 --> 1:00:14.320
I'm working on it.

1:00:14.487 --> 1:00:16.281
Will you have it soon?

1:00:23.037 --> 1:00:25.331
Look! It's Professor Von Zimmel!

1:00:26.124 --> 1:00:27.458
We're still unnoticed.

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:31.212
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry to interrupt the music,

1:00:31.379 --> 1:00:33.506
but we have a special guest.

1:00:33.673 --> 1:00:35.883
Let's greet him as he deserves.

1:00:36.050 --> 1:00:39.887
Please give a warm hand
to Mr. Noël Flantier.

1:00:44.267 --> 1:00:46.311
At least I'm still undercover.

1:00:46.477 --> 1:00:48.688
Mr. Noël Flantier, also known as

1:00:49.272 --> 1:00:50.315
OSS 117!

1:00:56.404 --> 1:00:57.280
Heinrich!

1:00:57.613 --> 1:00:59.449
Heinrich is finished.

1:01:03.786 --> 1:01:05.371
I'm Friedrich!

1:01:05.747 --> 1:01:08.041
I'll be damned! Heinrich?

1:01:08.875 --> 1:01:09.876
A hairpiech?

1:01:10.251 --> 1:01:13.713
You see, there's one thing
I didn't lie about.

1:01:13.963 --> 1:01:15.840
My desire to change the world!

1:01:16.132 --> 1:01:18.051
What do you want, Von Zimmel?

1:01:18.634 --> 1:01:20.094
What's this all about?

1:01:20.428 --> 1:01:21.846
The Fourth Reich?

1:01:23.473 --> 1:01:26.642
The Fourth Reich is a dream
doomed to failure.

1:01:26.809 --> 1:01:30.104
Everyone tried it. It never worked.
I'm moving on.

1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:33.941
I've decided to lay
the foundation of a real

1:01:34.108 --> 1:01:36.110
new world.

1:01:39.822 --> 1:01:42.700
A world more unfair,

1:01:43.034 --> 1:01:45.370
a world more intolerant,

1:01:45.536 --> 1:01:47.538
more unfriendly,

1:01:47.747 --> 1:01:50.875
where there will always be war,

1:01:51.042 --> 1:01:52.502
always disease.

1:01:53.669 --> 1:01:54.962
This world,

1:01:56.381 --> 1:01:58.299
my world,

1:01:59.133 --> 1:02:02.220
is the Fifth Reich!

1:02:08.476 --> 1:02:09.852
Utopists!

1:02:11.270 --> 1:02:11.896
Hold this.

1:02:14.482 --> 1:02:15.108
My friends!

1:02:17.193 --> 1:02:18.903
I understand your anger.

1:02:19.278 --> 1:02:21.030
I understand your hatred.

1:02:21.864 --> 1:02:23.324
But for God's sake,

1:02:23.574 --> 1:02:25.034
don't give into cynicism.

1:02:26.077 --> 1:02:27.870
Beware of hasty solutions.

1:02:28.162 --> 1:02:29.747
Of course,

1:02:30.623 --> 1:02:32.792
I see what you like about Nazism.

1:02:32.959 --> 1:02:35.002
Besides, who's to judge?

1:02:35.753 --> 1:02:37.588
Sometimes even I get angry.

1:02:40.091 --> 1:02:42.552
But are there no other solutions?

1:02:42.969 --> 1:02:46.806
Did the children you once were
dream of this world?

1:02:51.686 --> 1:02:53.938
These children still exist.

1:02:55.148 --> 1:02:56.899
I'm speaking to them.

1:02:57.316 --> 1:02:59.026
Let me ask them a question.

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:01.070
A simple question.

1:03:09.203 --> 1:03:11.664
What if the 5th Reich
were the Reich...

1:03:14.459 --> 1:03:15.918
of Love?

1:03:38.441 --> 1:03:42.236
Instead of inspiring these Nazis
I got taunts and jibes.

1:03:42.528 --> 1:03:43.488
Enough!

1:03:44.530 --> 1:03:47.658
I'll tend to you later.
Put them in my office.

1:03:50.203 --> 1:03:51.537
You're hurting me!

1:03:59.545 --> 1:04:01.130
What the hell?

1:04:03.549 --> 1:04:07.470
Don't worry.
I blundered before, but I'll save us.

1:04:10.264 --> 1:04:11.140
Delightful.

1:04:14.769 --> 1:04:17.230
Hitler! I hate that guy!

1:04:25.321 --> 1:04:26.364
I found my idea.

1:04:27.865 --> 1:04:30.868
I'd say we have half an hour.
Plenty of time.

1:04:33.371 --> 1:04:34.372
Already?

1:04:36.749 --> 1:04:39.210
I was too impatient to see you.

1:04:39.377 --> 1:04:41.921
A waste of time! I won't speak!

1:04:42.338 --> 1:04:45.258
Not a problem.
I haven't asked anything.

1:04:45.466 --> 1:04:49.303
You give me a feeling of déjà-vu.
Your tired recipes,

1:04:49.470 --> 1:04:53.474
secret offices, swastikas,
Nazi caverns. It's all so banal.

1:04:54.016 --> 1:04:55.059
Of course.

1:04:57.687 --> 1:05:00.106
You, on the other hand,

1:05:02.191 --> 1:05:04.151
are a reporter.

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:09.782
Are you writing a nice story?

1:05:11.951 --> 1:05:13.286
You're teasing me.

1:05:13.452 --> 1:05:15.288
Taking nice pictures?

1:05:18.499 --> 1:05:20.585
Mr. Noël Flantier!

1:05:21.419 --> 1:05:22.962
Nazi humor. Pathetic.

1:05:23.337 --> 1:05:25.673
The joke's over, OSS 117!

1:05:31.012 --> 1:05:32.305
Turn around!

1:05:46.444 --> 1:05:49.071
Welcome to my laboratory!

1:05:50.281 --> 1:05:51.574
Zantrax, Blue Devil,

1:05:51.741 --> 1:05:53.743
undress him and tie him up!

1:05:54.076 --> 1:05:55.036
Why me?

1:05:55.244 --> 1:05:58.539
My costume!
Fascist dogs, you'll pay for this!

1:06:01.334 --> 1:06:02.752
Carlotta!

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:06.756
So that's something more comfy?
Those rags of hate and chaos!

1:06:06.922 --> 1:06:09.717
I am not Carlotta.
I'm Fraulein Freida.

1:06:09.884 --> 1:06:11.886
For me you'll always be Carlotta.

1:06:13.137 --> 1:06:15.723
For me you'll always be
Noël Flantier.

1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:24.148
No more games!

1:06:25.274 --> 1:06:27.777
Enough boasting, Mr. de la Bath.

1:06:28.027 --> 1:06:31.280
Now we'll see
what you're really made of.

1:06:31.447 --> 1:06:33.157
You won't be the first.

1:06:33.324 --> 1:06:37.328
No, I'm talking literally
about what you're made of.

1:06:40.081 --> 1:06:41.415
What are you doing?

1:06:41.874 --> 1:06:44.126
I'm opening my safe.

1:06:44.293 --> 1:06:47.755
Years ago, I sewed into your chest
two microfilms.

1:06:47.922 --> 1:06:50.841
One, a list of French collaborators.

1:06:51.008 --> 1:06:53.511
The other, more important:

1:06:53.678 --> 1:06:58.182
a list of Swiss bank accounts
containing fabulous war treasures.

1:06:58.516 --> 1:06:59.767
Why don't I remember?

1:07:00.309 --> 1:07:01.602
Thanks to this.

1:07:01.936 --> 1:07:05.439
A potion that erases
short-term memory.

1:07:06.357 --> 1:07:07.400
My God!

1:07:07.566 --> 1:07:09.068
I remember!

1:07:11.570 --> 1:07:12.738
What are you doing?

1:07:12.905 --> 1:07:15.282
I'm opening my safe.

1:07:15.449 --> 1:07:18.994
I'm sewing into your chest
two microfilms.

1:07:19.161 --> 1:07:21.747
One, a list of French collaborators.

1:07:21.914 --> 1:07:23.165
The other,

1:07:23.332 --> 1:07:27.503
a list of Swiss bank accounts
containing fabulous war treasures!

1:07:27.670 --> 1:07:29.171
Why won't I remember?

1:07:29.338 --> 1:07:31.215
Thanks to this!

1:07:31.382 --> 1:07:34.760
A potion that erases
all short-term memory.

1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:40.391
Intact.

1:07:40.558 --> 1:07:42.893
Thank you, OSS 117.

1:07:43.436 --> 1:07:47.022
Now you see why it had to be you
who came here.

1:07:47.398 --> 1:07:51.402
All that best agent stuff
was hogwash. But you knew it.

1:07:52.945 --> 1:07:55.322
Goodbye, OSS 117.

1:07:56.907 --> 1:07:58.033
Kill them.

1:08:03.748 --> 1:08:04.790
Untie him!

1:08:07.918 --> 1:08:10.755
I paid you'd say.
Said you'd pay.

1:08:10.921 --> 1:08:11.756
Whatever.

1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:15.509
Good going, Dolores.
Get the microfilm.

1:08:19.764 --> 1:08:20.806
It's not me.

1:08:20.973 --> 1:08:22.391
Who then?

1:08:22.933 --> 1:08:25.853
I saw. I know.
But I won't say.

1:08:26.645 --> 1:08:28.189
Friedrich...

1:08:28.355 --> 1:08:29.607
My schon.

1:08:34.612 --> 1:08:35.237
Why?

1:08:38.199 --> 1:08:38.991
Kill them!

1:09:21.242 --> 1:09:22.243
Let's go.

1:09:38.175 --> 1:09:39.510
Careful, Hubert!

1:10:25.556 --> 1:10:27.600
Go on, be more aggressive!

1:10:53.083 --> 1:10:53.667
Go on!

1:11:20.861 --> 1:11:21.654
Look.

1:11:21.862 --> 1:11:22.947
No hair.

1:11:24.615 --> 1:11:25.950
Hair we go again!

1:11:26.909 --> 1:11:28.243
Your bow and arrows.

1:11:28.410 --> 1:11:30.621
You're right.
Let's go, Dolores!

1:11:37.544 --> 1:11:39.380
This round's not over yet.

1:11:49.723 --> 1:11:51.058
Shoot, Hubert.

1:12:01.068 --> 1:12:02.695
I don't understand...

1:12:04.071 --> 1:12:05.906
Of course! It's a kiddie toy!

1:12:06.490 --> 1:12:08.492
Hurry, they're getting away!

1:12:08.826 --> 1:12:10.369
Right! Let's tail them!

1:12:32.766 --> 1:12:33.934
There they are!

1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:51.160
You drive like a man!

1:12:51.326 --> 1:12:53.954
We need Von Zimmel.
We can't fail.

1:12:54.121 --> 1:12:56.081
That was a compliment.

1:12:56.373 --> 1:12:58.584
Israel must judge ex-Nazis.

1:12:59.043 --> 1:12:59.835
Of course.

1:13:00.002 --> 1:13:03.589
It's our responsibility.
We're a modern democracy.

1:13:04.173 --> 1:13:05.591
You bet!

1:13:10.220 --> 1:13:11.638
You surprise me.

1:13:12.222 --> 1:13:14.975
You're dogged, brave.
You never crack.

1:13:15.142 --> 1:13:17.227
Never chicken out.

1:13:17.394 --> 1:13:20.606
You're fearless, beautiful, elegant.

1:13:22.274 --> 1:13:24.985
It's simple:
you're my female alter-ego.

1:13:27.738 --> 1:13:29.364
I like you.

1:13:29.782 --> 1:13:30.824
A lot.

1:13:32.284 --> 1:13:33.452
Know what I want?

1:13:39.708 --> 1:13:40.751
I don't get it.

1:13:41.085 --> 1:13:42.211
You turn me off.

1:13:42.503 --> 1:13:43.712
And I don't get it!

1:13:44.963 --> 1:13:46.006
Explain yourself.

1:13:46.173 --> 1:13:49.343
I'm a remedy against barbarism,
a symbol of...

1:13:49.510 --> 1:13:51.345
You're old. Pretentious.

1:13:51.512 --> 1:13:53.097
A misogynist.

1:13:53.263 --> 1:13:56.100
Full of yourself, vain,
borderline racist.

1:13:56.266 --> 1:13:59.853
Tacky dresser, childish, not funny.
Shall I stop?

1:14:02.564 --> 1:14:04.066
A tacky dresser?

1:14:12.199 --> 1:14:13.450
It's hot in here.

1:14:27.297 --> 1:14:28.882
I like it when you smile.

1:14:30.384 --> 1:14:32.427
You have a very sweet smile.

1:14:35.389 --> 1:14:37.266
You must have heard it before.

1:14:55.450 --> 1:14:57.452
Look, they pulled over.

1:14:57.703 --> 1:14:59.538
No more gas. How typical.

1:14:59.788 --> 1:15:01.665
The problem with Mercedes.

1:15:08.422 --> 1:15:09.047
Follow her.

1:15:09.214 --> 1:15:09.923
I'll get him.

1:15:10.090 --> 1:15:11.758
Remember. We need him alive.

1:15:12.217 --> 1:15:13.594
Count on me.

1:17:21.930 --> 1:17:22.931
Where am I?

1:17:33.525 --> 1:17:34.735
Von Zim...

1:18:13.857 --> 1:18:15.359
Stop.

1:18:40.675 --> 1:18:41.718
Von Zim...

1:20:12.142 --> 1:20:12.934
Going up?

1:20:20.901 --> 1:20:21.985
Are you okay?

1:20:23.278 --> 1:20:24.446
Fine, thanks.

1:20:28.909 --> 1:20:30.535
Where are my clothes?

1:20:30.702 --> 1:20:33.830
The green leotard?
It was torn. We tossed it.

1:20:34.247 --> 1:20:35.457
Pity.

1:20:36.708 --> 1:20:38.585
Got any spare clothes?

1:20:40.003 --> 1:20:42.255
The old gardener has some.

1:20:42.631 --> 1:20:44.925
But they may not be your style.

1:20:45.592 --> 1:20:48.845
Perfect. Not the latest fashion,
but it'll do.

1:21:00.106 --> 1:21:02.275
Did the old geezer make a call?

1:21:02.526 --> 1:21:03.818
With a bit of luck...

1:21:11.618 --> 1:21:13.662
Doodles. They make no sense.

1:21:13.828 --> 1:21:14.955
Why not ask him?

1:21:15.121 --> 1:21:17.832
He said "8 o'clock at the Corcovado."

1:21:19.834 --> 1:21:21.127
- May I?
- Of course.

1:21:30.679 --> 1:21:31.596
It's urgent.

1:21:37.519 --> 1:21:38.687
It's ringing.

1:21:41.273 --> 1:21:41.982
It's me, Hubert.

1:21:42.148 --> 1:21:44.651
- I was worried sick.
- You were anxious?

1:21:44.818 --> 1:21:46.152
I thought you died.

1:21:47.237 --> 1:21:49.072
How kind. Get Carlotta?

1:21:49.239 --> 1:21:50.448
She's behind bars.

1:21:50.615 --> 1:21:54.828
Von Zimmel is meeting someone
at the Corcovado at 8 o'clock.

1:21:54.995 --> 1:21:57.080
Let's meet at Bill's office.

1:21:57.455 --> 1:21:58.999
See you. Be careful.

1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:08.466
Bill, it's Hubert.

1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:13.722
Yes, probably. It's about Dolores.

1:22:13.888 --> 1:22:15.432
I need your help.

1:22:15.599 --> 1:22:17.767
Von Zimmel, the Corcovado, at 8.

1:22:19.144 --> 1:22:20.020
Obviously.

1:22:49.716 --> 1:22:51.468
Good! It's all clear.

1:22:52.677 --> 1:22:55.096
You've helped France.
I'm forever grateful.

1:22:55.597 --> 1:22:57.932
By the way,
where can I find a car?

1:22:58.099 --> 1:22:59.809
The old gardener has one.

1:23:00.143 --> 1:23:01.603
But is it your style?

1:24:16.177 --> 1:24:17.387
Bill?

1:24:43.747 --> 1:24:44.998
Dolores?

1:25:04.017 --> 1:25:05.643
You gave me a scare!

1:25:07.270 --> 1:25:08.688
What's wrong with you?

1:25:11.566 --> 1:25:13.151
Except for the heat.

1:25:13.318 --> 1:25:14.235
What is it?

1:25:15.487 --> 1:25:18.615
Von Zimmel is scared of the Mossad.

1:25:18.782 --> 1:25:22.786
He contacted the CIA
in exchange for valuable information.

1:25:23.203 --> 1:25:24.454
Clever, Bill.

1:25:25.371 --> 1:25:26.831
Why protect an SS?

1:25:26.998 --> 1:25:28.958
Americans are against Nazis!

1:25:29.209 --> 1:25:31.753
The CIA isn't America, OSS 117.

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:32.670
That hurts!

1:25:33.129 --> 1:25:34.839
Freeze or I'll slay her.

1:25:36.883 --> 1:25:39.260
Free her.
Our countries are allies.

1:25:39.469 --> 1:25:43.181
We're allies
only when you ask us to liberate you.

1:25:43.348 --> 1:25:44.390
Meaning?

1:25:44.682 --> 1:25:46.059
I'm sorry.

1:25:46.309 --> 1:25:48.353
You liberated yourselves.

1:25:50.438 --> 1:25:51.648
Chinaman behind you!

1:25:51.815 --> 1:25:53.191
How old are you?

1:25:56.820 --> 1:25:58.571
You kill brother in taxi.

1:26:04.702 --> 1:26:06.663
Put down your gun, OSS 117!

1:26:13.378 --> 1:26:16.130
Carlotta, you can still make amends.

1:26:16.339 --> 1:26:19.968
The Nazi hunters and the Chinese
will never let up.

1:26:21.553 --> 1:26:23.638
I beg of you, think it over.

1:26:30.937 --> 1:26:31.980
If you help us,

1:26:32.146 --> 1:26:36.150
I'll serve as a mediator with the
Prime Minister, Mr. Pompidou.

1:26:37.527 --> 1:26:38.903
You'll be pardoned.

1:26:39.153 --> 1:26:43.324
An international coalition
will be immediately organized...

1:26:43.783 --> 1:26:45.368
to create a Nazi country.

1:26:48.204 --> 1:26:49.372
Like Israel.

1:27:02.135 --> 1:27:03.553
Great to see you.

1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:05.179
I prayed you'd come.

1:27:05.346 --> 1:27:08.266
Really?
You've said two nice things now.

1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:11.269
- Are you sure?
- The first was on the phone...

1:27:11.436 --> 1:27:13.605
- We're in a rush, Hubert.
- You're right.

1:27:13.771 --> 1:27:14.564
Come on!

1:27:19.652 --> 1:27:21.070
Give me a second.

1:27:24.866 --> 1:27:26.367
Don't I know you?

1:27:27.327 --> 1:27:28.411
Yeah!

1:27:29.203 --> 1:27:31.581
We slept together on the beach.

1:27:32.790 --> 1:27:34.334
Slept together?

1:27:36.127 --> 1:27:38.338
You make it sound like...

1:27:54.604 --> 1:27:57.899
And what are you up to now?

1:27:58.191 --> 1:28:00.234
I'm eating a candied apple.

1:28:01.402 --> 1:28:02.862
Want a bite?

1:28:04.364 --> 1:28:06.866
To hell with your forbidden fruit!

1:28:18.878 --> 1:28:19.921
Don't worry!

1:28:26.552 --> 1:28:28.888
Remember, I need him alive.

1:28:29.263 --> 1:28:31.808
Surrender, Von Zimmel! It's over!

1:28:31.975 --> 1:28:35.103
Trumendous is dead<i>. Carlotta too.
And the Chinaman!</i>

1:28:35.728 --> 1:28:36.688
They never met.

1:28:39.273 --> 1:28:42.318
Be a man, Von Zimmel.
Surrender quietly.

1:28:42.610 --> 1:28:44.529
I'd rather die first.

1:28:44.821 --> 1:28:47.824
Too bad for you, Dolores.
I intend to die.

1:28:48.449 --> 1:28:51.077
You killed my son, now my fiancée.

1:28:51.244 --> 1:28:54.122
You stole it all.
My death belongs to me!

1:28:54.539 --> 1:28:55.748
He's going to shoot.

1:28:55.915 --> 1:28:57.333
He's bluffing.

1:28:57.500 --> 1:29:00.211
I doubt it.
He knows what awaits him.

1:29:00.962 --> 1:29:02.005
By the way,

1:29:02.422 --> 1:29:04.966
in case you haven't noticed,

1:29:06.467 --> 1:29:08.386
behind the Nazi...

1:29:09.595 --> 1:29:11.097
there's also a man.

1:29:11.681 --> 1:29:13.891
A man like any other.

1:29:14.434 --> 1:29:15.685
A Nazi...

1:29:17.353 --> 1:29:19.063
does he not have eyes?

1:29:21.607 --> 1:29:23.109
A Nazi...

1:29:23.860 --> 1:29:25.319
does he not have hands?

1:29:25.653 --> 1:29:27.989
You're right. I think he's sincere.

1:29:28.531 --> 1:29:29.907
He's desperate.

1:29:31.826 --> 1:29:33.619
If you prick us,

1:29:33.786 --> 1:29:35.663
do we not bleed?

1:29:36.581 --> 1:29:38.791
If you tickle us,

1:29:39.375 --> 1:29:41.044
do we not laugh?

1:29:42.128 --> 1:29:44.672
And if you poison us,

1:29:44.964 --> 1:29:47.717
do we not die?

1:29:51.637 --> 1:29:52.764
Magnificent.

1:29:53.347 --> 1:29:54.640
Beautiful words.

1:29:55.516 --> 1:29:57.351
Beautiful and overwhelming.

1:29:58.603 --> 1:30:00.646
I'm an old man...

1:30:01.189 --> 1:30:04.400
I'm 46. My life is over.
You've taken it all.

1:30:05.359 --> 1:30:07.653
- I'll go around.
- Leave it to me.

1:30:09.697 --> 1:30:11.324
Farewell, OSS 117.

1:30:13.284 --> 1:30:14.368
That's enough!

1:30:14.535 --> 1:30:17.246
For France, turn over the microfilm!

1:30:17.705 --> 1:30:20.291
And for Israel, turn yourself in!

1:30:22.627 --> 1:30:23.669
What now?

1:30:26.297 --> 1:30:29.092
He's going to plunge
from Christ's arm!

1:30:30.009 --> 1:30:32.929
Not if we stop him
from taking the plunge!

1:30:33.221 --> 1:30:34.972
And your fear of heights?

1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:38.226
Each of us must conquer his fears.

1:30:38.392 --> 1:30:39.852
Yours is Nazis.

1:30:41.187 --> 1:30:42.605
Mine is trapeze.

1:31:35.908 --> 1:31:37.910
Halt, Von Zimmel! Surrender!

1:31:38.077 --> 1:31:39.203
Surrender?

1:31:39.579 --> 1:31:41.956
Find something
more persuasive, old pal.

1:31:42.373 --> 1:31:46.294
And try not to get
one of your dizzy spells.

1:31:48.296 --> 1:31:52.550
You'll have to move forward
despite your vertigo...

1:32:29.295 --> 1:32:30.963
It was an accident!

1:32:31.172 --> 1:32:33.925
A simple trapeze accident!

1:32:39.263 --> 1:32:42.099
Farewell... OSS 117.

1:32:59.659 --> 1:33:00.868
Let go of me!

1:33:01.953 --> 1:33:02.912
Let go!

1:33:03.079 --> 1:33:04.664
Not this time!

1:33:04.830 --> 1:33:07.416
W <i>il</i> k <i>ommen in Israel, Herr Professor!</i>

1:33:09.627 --> 1:33:10.920
Bravo, Hubert.

1:33:11.337 --> 1:33:13.464
To the spy and the trapeze artist.

1:33:14.799 --> 1:33:16.676
Thanks for saving his life.

1:33:16.842 --> 1:33:17.927
It's nothing.

1:33:18.261 --> 1:33:20.888
I'm proud
to help an Israeli save a Nazi.

1:33:22.014 --> 1:33:23.266
I see it as a sign.

1:33:23.474 --> 1:33:27.311
Why not hope for reconciliation
between Jews and Nazis?

1:33:27.979 --> 1:33:30.147
Something about you baffles me.

1:33:30.398 --> 1:33:31.274
What?

1:33:32.191 --> 1:33:32.858
This.

1:33:38.281 --> 1:33:39.740
Happy, Noël.

1:34:31.834 --> 1:34:32.501
Hello, boss.

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:34.462
Hello, Hubert. Bravo!

1:34:34.628 --> 1:34:37.882
We got the microfilm
without even paying.

1:34:38.049 --> 1:34:38.716
Hats off!

1:34:39.091 --> 1:34:40.676
Thank God you sent me.

1:34:44.305 --> 1:34:47.850
- Want to show me a movie?
- It's broken. Tough luck.

1:34:50.227 --> 1:34:53.147
I want to discuss...
something irksome.

1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:56.067
It's probably nothing but...

1:34:56.484 --> 1:34:59.278
your name was on the list
of collaborators.

1:35:00.780 --> 1:35:02.198
I heard that.

1:35:05.618 --> 1:35:07.078
Trying times...

1:35:07.411 --> 1:35:08.829
Trying times...

1:35:12.041 --> 1:35:13.834
But what's past is past.

1:35:15.419 --> 1:35:18.631
France needs to forget.
To move forward.

1:35:20.299 --> 1:35:21.926
Yes, no doubt.

1:35:22.385 --> 1:35:23.761
Now I feel reassured.

1:35:24.303 --> 1:35:26.222
I've thought of you too.

1:35:28.307 --> 1:35:29.100
You mean?

1:35:29.392 --> 1:35:30.684
The Legion of Honor.

1:35:33.813 --> 1:35:36.649
I spoke to the Prime Minister,
Mr. Pompidou.

1:35:37.066 --> 1:35:38.484
It can happen this week.

1:35:46.700 --> 1:35:49.412
Thank you, Armand.
I'm speechless.

1:35:49.578 --> 1:35:51.330
So don't speak.

1:35:51.497 --> 1:35:52.915
You're not vain.

1:35:53.082 --> 1:35:54.375
Of course I'm not.

1:35:54.542 --> 1:35:55.876
Of course!

1:35:56.836 --> 1:35:58.587
Let's get down to business.

1:35:58.754 --> 1:36:01.715
You have another mission.
To China, no less.

1:36:01.882 --> 1:36:03.217
A man named Lee

1:36:03.384 --> 1:36:07.012
took 50 French hostages
and will negotiate only with you.

1:36:07.388 --> 1:36:08.514
One condition.

1:36:08.681 --> 1:36:10.015
Deal. What is it?

1:36:10.307 --> 1:36:11.892
I pick my own name.

1:36:15.146 --> 1:36:18.399
For Mr. Lee,
I can grant you some lee-way.

1:36:26.782 --> 1:36:28.367
Lee-ve it to me!

1:36:33.122 --> 1:36:35.040
Although it's not lee-gal.

1:36:43.883 --> 1:36:45.217
Be lee-nient!

1:36:47.136 --> 1:36:49.513
I think we've about covered it.

1:36:53.225 --> 1:36:54.935
You're right.

1:36:58.731 --> 1:36:59.940
Follow the lee-der.

1:37:05.571 --> 1:37:07.031
It's very strange.

1:37:07.656 --> 1:37:10.659
Unintentionally,
I just used Jewish humor.

1:37:10.868 --> 1:37:12.203
Really? What's that?

1:37:13.787 --> 1:37:17.833
It's when it's not funny
and there's no mention of sausages.
