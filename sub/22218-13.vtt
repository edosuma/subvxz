11:52.461 --> 11:54.713
{\an8}<i>The huge area of black</i>

11:54.797 --> 11:57.091
{\an8}<i>definitely gives it</i>
<i>a cover-up feel.</i>

11:57.174 --> 11:59.301
{\an8}<i>The shape of the ball was</i>
<i>warped due to the contour</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:00.261
{\an8}<i>of his leg.</i>

12:00.344 --> 12:01.554
He definitely lost

12:01.637 --> 12:03.472
<i>the symmetrical shape</i>
<i>of the ball.</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:04.515
<i>- Craig does how own thing.</i>

12:36.005 --> 12:39.175
We had to pick out
the weakest tattoos of the day.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.802
{\an3}- I don't think that
Chris was able to

12:41.886 --> 12:43.179
{\an8}<i>replicate the proportions</i>

12:43.262 --> 12:44.180
{\an9}<i>of the two white stripes</i>
<i>properly,</i>

12:44.263 --> 12:46.432
{\an9}and it gave the ball
a completely off look.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.641
- Past few challenges,

12:47.725 --> 12:51.187
he has dropped the ball,
so to speak.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.188
<i>Craig really surprised me.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:54.315
{\an8}<i>- In the shape of the ball,</i>
<i>he lost it.</i>

12:54.398 --> 12:56.609
{\an8}In the area of doing
too much black, he lost it.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.818
- What about the stronger
tattoos of the day?

12:57.902 --> 13:00.905
<i>- I think Matt's tattoo</i>
<i>came out really strong.</i>

13:00.988 --> 13:03.282
<i>It really had</i>
<i>a realistic feel to it.</i>

13:03.365 --> 13:04.533
<i>The Duval for Duval County</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
looks like the brand
on the football,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.204
{\an1}<i>but it made it personal</i>
<i>to this guy.</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:09.497
{\an8}<i>- Tyler's tattoo,</i>

13:09.580 --> 13:11.248
{\an9}<i>the tips of the football</i>
<i>are nice and rounded</i>

13:11.332 --> 13:13.209
{\an8}because a football, literally,
bubbles in this way,

13:13.292 --> 13:13.959
'cause it's
all stitched together.

13:14.043 --> 13:14.877
Tyler really did a great job.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.837
- All right, guys.
Wanna let 'em know?

13:16.921 --> 13:19.673

- All right, let's do it.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.010
<i>Today, you had to show</i>
<i>perfect technical application</i>

13:23.093 --> 13:25.554

13:25.638 --> 13:28.057
Some of you fumbled.
Chris.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.142
{\an3}- The back stripe didn't match
the front stripe

13:30.226 --> 13:31.894
{\an9}<i>and it gave the football,</i>
<i>definitely in the back,</i>

13:31.977 --> 13:32.937
{\an8}<i>a flattened look.</i>

13:33.020 --> 13:34.188
{\an8}- The view is foreshortened,

13:34.271 --> 13:35.397
therefore, the back stripe
would appear smaller.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.401
{\an3}- That back stripe was
the one part that let you down.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.611
- Craig.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.072
{\an8}<i>- Everybody in the room</i>
<i>definitely saw the fact that</i>

13:43.155 --> 13:44.657
{\an8}<i>that ball was</i>
<i>a little deflated.</i>

13:44.740 --> 13:46.742
- I like the tattoo.
I thought it looked pretty cool.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.369
- Do you not see that one side
of the ball

13:48.452 --> 13:49.954
was a different shape than
the other side of the ball?

13:50.037 --> 13:51.830
- It's an angle that you can't
see the back of the ball.

13:51.914 --> 13:52.915
So, no.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.750
- Everybody that looks at it
feels like it had

13:54.833 --> 13:55.709
the incorrect shape.
It was a general consensus--

13:55.793 --> 13:57.753
- I'm just saying,
I just don't see it.

13:57.836 --> 13:58.796
<i>So, I'm not gonna agree</i>
<i>with you on that.</i>

13:58.879 --> 14:02.675
- I just can't--
- Your shape was definitely off.

{\an8}- Tyler's,
the actual football itself,

14:19.650 --> 14:21.610
{\an8}was the closest shape
to a football in the room.

39:37.666 --> 39:41.212
{\an1}<i>Duffy has cleaner outlines</i>
<i>and solid black on the ribs.</i>

39:41.295 --> 39:45.758
{\an1}So, for me, it's between
Craig and Tyler.

39:45.841 --> 39:48.094
<i>- Tyler's drawing is</i>
<i>the one that's unrecognizable.</i>

39:48.177 --> 39:50.971
I don't know what animal
Tyler tattooed.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.432
- Vote's for Tyler.
<i>- The judges have decided.</i>

39:53.516 --> 39:58.229
Tyler, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.606
- Tyler, I really think
that your overconfidence

40:00.689 --> 40:02.441
{\an1}caused you to make
some rookie mistakes,

40:02.525 --> 40:04.193
{\an1}and not have
the attention to detail

40:04.276 --> 40:06.153
{\an1}that we've seen you shine
for before.

40:06.237 --> 40:09.031
{\an1}I think consistency
might have been your weak point.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.950
- Tyler,
please pack your machines

40:11.033 --> 40:15.121
and close shop.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.831
- I can still
tattoo circles around

40:16.914 --> 40:17.540
most of those mother[bleep].

40:17.623 --> 40:19.667
<i>I want to win this [bleep].</i>

40:19.750 --> 40:21.001
I was so [bleep] close.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.803
- We always end up
in some shady place.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.180
- Welcome to the top five.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.974
- I'm literally
left to the wolves.

40:35.057 --> 40:35.808
- When it's your time
it's your time.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.143
- This is how it was
meant to be,

40:37.226 --> 40:38.561
<i>me and you in the end together.</i>

40:38.644 --> 40:40.521
- The last thing I'm gonna do
is rollover on Duffy.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.189
{\an3}- I don't think
you have a choice.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.357
- You completely changed
the dynamic of the face.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.026
- It looks like
the nose is going this way

40:46.110 --> 40:47.403
and the face is going that way.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.529
- It's just not the tattoo

40:48.612 --> 40:49.530
you want to disappoint on,
for sure.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.366
- It's painstakingly obviously
that portraits

40:52.449 --> 40:53.701
are not your thing.
