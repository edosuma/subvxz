12:43.834 --> 12:45.867
- Ah! Ah!

12:54.934 --> 12:57.800
- Gentlemen, I can't
put you all in the Hole

12:57.867 --> 13:00.967
because the Hole
is full right now.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.934
And I can't transfer
you out of Emerald City

13:03.000 --> 13:05.934
because all the cells in Oz
happen to be full, too.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.133
But what I can do is
take away your privileges.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.934
No TV, no gym, no phone calls
for one month.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.767
- Gee, Dad, I hope I can
still make it to the prom.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.033
[laughter]
- Two months!

13:19.100 --> 13:21.467
You happy, Alvarez?
That's all.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.467
[indistinct chatter]

13:28.066 --> 13:29.467
You know,

13:29.533 --> 13:32.400
looks like everybody
but Said has a weapon.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.266
- Oh, he ain't stupid.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.934
- Yo, who was the rat?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.767
- I hear it's Mershah.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.867
[man singing Muslim prayer]

14:23.467 --> 14:25.200
- You know something?

14:25.266 --> 14:28.266
Kareem, you're supposed
to be an Iman,

14:28.333 --> 14:30.867
a teacher,

14:30.934 --> 14:33.600
and all you taught me
was that your God

14:33.667 --> 14:36.100
is full of
hate and vengeance.

14:37.233 --> 14:40.934
So you better
watch out, okay?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.300
'Cause he could turn on you,
just like he turned on me.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.800
[indistinct chatter]

15:02.867 --> 15:04.166
- You wanna kill a man?

15:04.233 --> 15:06.900
Stick a shank in his chest.
[spitting]

15:20.367 --> 15:21.967
You wanna torture a man,

15:22.033 --> 15:24.166
feed his loneliness.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.433
Fiending for friendship,
for peace,

15:26.500 --> 15:29.200
he will search everywhere.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.200
And when he realizes
that he won't find it,

15:36.266 --> 15:38.967
he will destroy himself.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.100
- I have asked you here
because I'm a worried man.

15:46.166 --> 15:49.100
The death of Huseni Mershah
is yet another example of

15:49.166 --> 15:51.166
of the brutality that
we suffer here.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.834
- But his death
was a suicide.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.834
- That is what the
authorities have claimed,

15:54.900 --> 15:57.767
but what I know is,
six men have died

15:57.834 --> 16:00.066
under bizarre circumstances.

16:00.133 --> 16:04.567
Suffocation, fire, mutilation.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.800
And the list continues on.

16:06.867 --> 16:10.166
And Warden Glynn sits
in his office, aloof.

16:10.233 --> 16:13.367
Now, the FBI was brought in
to do an investigation,

16:13.433 --> 16:14.934
but where is
their report?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.633
- Are you saying it's
been repressed?

16:18.700 --> 16:20.467
- I don't know.

16:20.533 --> 16:25.266
I asked the question in the hope
that you, the press,

16:25.333 --> 16:27.200
can find out.

16:27.266 --> 16:29.033
'cause we prisoners
of Oz, I believe,

16:29.100 --> 16:32.767
will sit here waiting for
answers that never come.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.133
- The FBI investigation
into the deaths

16:35.200 --> 16:37.567
at Oswald State Penitentiary
is ongoing.

16:37.633 --> 16:39.467
We're not about to rush it
just to satisfy

16:39.533 --> 16:41.133
the media or the inmates.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.934
We intend to do our work
thoroughly and completely.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.934
- Your little television show
got everybody's attention.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.266
But I'm afraid that was
your last performance.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.500
I'm ordering
a press blackout.

16:51.567 --> 16:55.767
- Warden, can't you see?

16:55.834 --> 16:59.567
Now, why is blackout
a big, bad thing?

16:59.633 --> 17:02.400
You can get White-Out
in a little bottle.

17:02.467 --> 17:05.200
- Don't be smug.
Don't you be smug with me,

17:05.266 --> 17:07.400
you son-of-a-bitch.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.800
From the first day
you got here,

17:09.867 --> 17:13.266
you have tried to destroy
everything that I built

17:13.333 --> 17:14.700
and everything
that I stand for.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.066
- Oh, that is pride!

17:18.133 --> 17:21.300
[sighs]
I know that well.

17:21.367 --> 17:24.500
McManus, you've given yourself
far too much importance.

17:24.567 --> 17:27.333
You see, because this thing
is larger than you.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.467
It's larger than me.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.834
So go ahead,
take the media away.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.166
Give us a blackout.

17:33.233 --> 17:36.233
Censor our letters,
tape our mouths shut.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.667
There will always be
a man to tell the truth.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.000
The truth will be heard.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.800
May I go now?

17:55.867 --> 17:58.000
'Cause it is time
for me to pray.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.433
[singing Muslim prayer]

18:04.500 --> 18:06.066
[bell rings]
- Listen up.

18:06.133 --> 18:08.200
Here are some new rules
from the Warden.

18:08.266 --> 18:12.166
"As of today, no inmate will be
allowed to use prayer beads,

18:12.233 --> 18:16.333
"prayer mats or special oils for
religious or other purposes.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.000
"Inmates will no longer be
allowed to wear

18:19.066 --> 18:21.066
"similar clothing
or head apparel

18:21.133 --> 18:25.533
identifying them as a member
of any group, gang or cult."

18:27.367 --> 18:28.533
- Whoa, whoa!

18:28.600 --> 18:32.000
No, no!

18:34.367 --> 18:36.200
Now, you do realize this is
a violation of our right

18:36.266 --> 18:38.200
to freely practice
our religion.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.033
- You can practice
all you want.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.066
Pray till the
cows come home.

18:42.133 --> 18:44.333
The Constitution does not
guarantee that you,

18:44.400 --> 18:47.500
as a prisoner
have the right to any stuff.

18:48.233 --> 18:49.667
- Easy!

18:49.734 --> 18:51.900
- You're going to
have to hand it over.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.433
Look, this can go
one of two ways.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.633
I vote for no blood.

19:04.967 --> 19:08.700
- This is a meaningless
gesture, brothers.

19:08.767 --> 19:11.934
Our faith is not in kufis,
beads or mats.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.834
It is in our hearts.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.133
- All right, let's go.
- All right, everyone,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.600
can I have your attention,
please?

19:30.667 --> 19:32.734
I've got some news
for you all.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.367
The FBI report will
be released today,

19:36.433 --> 19:38.100
and it will
state emphatically

19:38.166 --> 19:41.367
that Sanchez, Ortolani,

19:41.433 --> 19:44.700
Post, Martinez
and Markstrom

19:44.767 --> 19:46.867
were all killed
by inmates.

19:46.934 --> 19:49.633
[booing and yelling]

19:49.700 --> 19:51.734
Quiet down!

19:53.100 --> 19:57.133
The death of Huseni Mershah
has been ruled a suicide.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.667
[all banging]

19:58.734 --> 20:02.200
Stop it!

20:02.266 --> 20:05.233
Though it is likely that
some correctional officers

20:05.300 --> 20:07.767
may have been involved...

20:07.834 --> 20:11.000
in a secondary manner
with some of the murders.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.900
Knock it off!

20:16.834 --> 20:17.800
People, if you
don't knock it off,

20:17.867 --> 20:19.433
I'm not gonna be able to finish.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.533
[banging continues]

20:24.934 --> 20:27.266
Fine.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.233
[cheering]

20:51.633 --> 20:53.066
- When you stand up,
look in the mirror

20:53.133 --> 20:56.467
and say, like Solomon,
"I am black, but I am humbly--

20:56.533 --> 20:59.066
- [sharp whistling]
- Come on, let's go.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.734
- Go, go, go.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.567
- Mr. Said...

21:04.633 --> 21:06.667
- Hmm?

21:06.734 --> 21:09.367
- I just wanted to
tell you that

21:09.433 --> 21:11.767
the whole thing
with the spoons,

21:11.834 --> 21:14.734
the whole Allah thing,
it's awesome.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.400
The salami, I like him.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.867
- So what's up?

21:32.934 --> 21:35.166
You turning Muslim on me?

21:35.233 --> 21:37.700
- Hm?

21:37.767 --> 21:39.633
He's a great speaker,
that Said.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.934
He says our lives are crap
because of Glynn and McManus

21:42.033 --> 21:44.467
and the rest.

21:44.533 --> 21:48.133
Said says that Glynn's
guilty of worse crimes

21:48.200 --> 21:50.233
than any of us
have committed.

21:52.734 --> 21:53.734
You ever kill anybody?

21:53.800 --> 21:56.967
- Mm-mm. No, I ain't
done nothing.

21:58.266 --> 22:01.467
[sighs] I got a bum rap,
you know?

22:01.533 --> 22:04.133
I'm inn-o-cent.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.467
- I thought it'd be hard
to murder my parents,

22:06.533 --> 22:10.900
but it wasn't.
- Hey, how'd you whack 'em?

22:12.567 --> 22:15.734
- Ah, Ball-peen hammer.

22:20.867 --> 22:24.367
- Prisoner #97G414,
Donald Groves.

22:24.433 --> 22:27.200
Convicted July 3rd, '97,
two counts,

22:27.266 --> 22:28.533
murder in
the first-degree.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.867
Sentence: life imprisonment.

22:32.633 --> 22:36.000
I think I should
kill Warden Glynn.

22:36.066 --> 22:37.467
- What?

22:37.533 --> 22:40.667
- I think I ought to
kill Glynn.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.500
- [chuckles]
All right, look, this is what

22:43.567 --> 22:45.700
you should do, all right?

22:45.767 --> 22:47.767
You know that chick,
Dr. Nathan, all right?

22:47.834 --> 22:51.266
You go to her and you tell her
to write you a prescription.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.667
I'm telling you, she's got me
on these anti-depressants

22:53.734 --> 22:57.467
right now and I'm like--

22:57.533 --> 22:59.400
I'm sailing, man.

22:59.467 --> 23:02.233
- No.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.967
My first idea is best.

23:05.033 --> 23:07.200
Next chance I get,
I'll murder Glynn.

23:08.867 --> 23:11.033
- Look out!
- Oh!

23:11.100 --> 23:13.600
- Ohh! Oh!

23:15.734 --> 23:17.834
[gavel banging]

23:17.900 --> 23:21.700
- Donald Groves,
convicted August 21st, '97,

23:21.767 --> 23:23.600
murder in the first degree
in the death

23:23.667 --> 23:26.166
of corrections officer
Lawrence Smith.

23:26.233 --> 23:30.100
Sentence: death.

23:30.166 --> 23:33.166
This is a genocide.

23:33.233 --> 23:36.100
Killing murderers
is genocide.

23:40.033 --> 23:43.367
- Groves?

23:43.433 --> 23:45.200
- They beat me.
- Who?

23:49.867 --> 23:53.900
Groves, you have been
condemned to die

23:53.967 --> 23:55.900
for the murder
of Officer Smith.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.834
The State gives you
the right to choose

23:57.900 --> 24:00.800
any method you wish to die.

24:00.867 --> 24:03.133
- I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.433
You should be dead.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.667
You were the one
that was supposed to die.

24:07.734 --> 24:09.767
- How do you
want to die, Groves?

24:09.834 --> 24:11.600
Lethal injection,
electric chair?

24:11.667 --> 24:12.600
- Firing squad.

24:12.667 --> 24:14.300
- Firing squad?

24:14.367 --> 24:16.400
- Isn't that what they
do to assassins?

24:16.467 --> 24:18.066
- Fine.

24:18.133 --> 24:22.200
I'm going to personally  paint
the target on your heart.

24:22.266 --> 24:23.300
- Warden,

24:23.367 --> 24:24.500
Warden...

24:26.467 --> 24:29.700
Me killing you
wasn't personal, you know?

24:30.900 --> 24:32.934
It just had to be done.

24:38.033 --> 24:40.633
- When your shift's over,
come to my office.

24:40.700 --> 24:43.600
I want you to tell me why
I shouldn't fire  your asses.

24:45.233 --> 24:49.433
- Lawrence Smith
was an outstanding officer.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.633
He was an outstanding
human being.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.967
And he died for what
he truly believed in:

24:56.033 --> 24:57.066
justice.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.200
I think it would be
easier to get angry,

25:01.266 --> 25:03.734
to punish all the inmates

25:03.800 --> 25:05.700
for a crime committed
by one of them.

25:07.367 --> 25:10.233
- [groans]
Uhh...

25:10.300 --> 25:11.867
Ahh...

25:11.934 --> 25:13.900
- But knowing Lawrence,

25:13.967 --> 25:15.600
I don't think that
he would want his death

25:15.667 --> 25:18.800
to bring about more pain,
more suffering.

25:18.867 --> 25:20.934
[overlapping yelling]

25:27.500 --> 25:30.967
I think that he would want
his death to bring about...

25:31.033 --> 25:32.333
peace.

25:37.967 --> 25:39.500
[guard laughing]

25:45.934 --> 25:47.400
- You want to
get a drink?

25:47.467 --> 25:49.533
- No, no, I got
a press conference.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.967
- Oh, that sounds
like fun.

25:51.033 --> 25:53.500
- Warden?
- Yes, Eddie?

25:53.567 --> 25:56.000
- Did I hear right--
Groves wants a firing squad?

25:56.066 --> 25:57.667
- Yeah, the sick bastard.

25:57.734 --> 25:59.500
- Do we have
a firing squad?

25:59.567 --> 26:01.667
- No, I got to
put one together.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.333
- I'd like to volunteer.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.100
- Why?

26:06.166 --> 26:08.633
- Smitty was my friend.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.767
- You know, in this case,
I'm not sure

26:10.834 --> 26:12.500
if that's a good
enough reason, Eddie, I mean...

26:12.567 --> 26:15.967
this isn't about revenge,
it's about the law.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.700
But, uh...

26:18.967 --> 26:21.066
I'll get back to you.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.467
Gloria,
you wanted to see me?

26:25.533 --> 26:27.066
- Yeah. You're done.

26:27.133 --> 26:28.567
Look around--we got
a bumper crop

26:28.633 --> 26:30.533
of officer-related
injuries.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.133
- O'Reily,
what happened?

26:33.200 --> 26:35.667
- He hit me.
I wasn't doing dick,

40:00.200 --> 40:04.800
Sentence: 22 years.
Up for parole in eight.

40:04.867 --> 40:07.333
- This cello
was made in 1744

40:07.400 --> 40:10.066
by a man named Johannes Cuypers
in Amsterdam.

40:10.133 --> 40:11.967
- That's good, huh?

40:12.033 --> 40:14.467
- Yeah, it's good.
It's priceless to me.

40:14.533 --> 40:17.100
That's why we keep it locked
in the chaplain's office.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.600
- Oh, it sure is
beautiful.

40:20.967 --> 40:22.700
- Beautiful, but lonely.

40:22.767 --> 40:24.333
- Lonely?

40:24.400 --> 40:26.166
How does a cello
get lonely?

40:26.233 --> 40:28.767
- I have no one
to play with.

40:28.834 --> 40:30.467
- You sound great
by yourself.

40:30.533 --> 40:32.233
You don't need
anybody to play with.

40:32.300 --> 40:33.934
- I'm used to playing with
symphony orchestras--

40:34.000 --> 40:36.600
90 to 100 other musicians
making music.

40:36.667 --> 40:39.133
A cello by itself is just...

40:39.200 --> 40:40.967
just not the same.

40:41.033 --> 40:42.900
[suspenseful drumming]

40:42.967 --> 40:46.700
[thudding]

40:50.834 --> 40:52.967
- Kenny...

40:53.033 --> 40:54.467
you got any tits, man?

40:56.367 --> 40:58.667
Hey, where you going?
- I'll catch you later, man.

40:58.734 --> 41:00.100
- Come here,
hit this before you go.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.400
- Naw, man, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

41:01.467 --> 41:03.233
- Come on, man!
- Brother, I gotta pee!

41:03.300 --> 41:04.567
- No, don't be
a pussy, hit it!

41:04.633 --> 41:05.567
Come on.

41:05.633 --> 41:08.533
[tense percussive tones]

41:08.600 --> 41:10.734
Hit it good.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.700
There you go.

41:17.734 --> 41:19.400
- Everything I say
stays here, right?

41:19.467 --> 41:21.900
- You have  to ask?

41:21.967 --> 41:23.266
- Jackson Vahue.

41:23.333 --> 41:26.166
- Yeah, the
basketball star.

41:26.233 --> 41:29.066
- When he got to Em City,
I was excited,  you know?

41:29.133 --> 41:30.633
I mean, he's always
been my hero.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.567
- And you don't want him
to think you're a wimp,

41:32.633 --> 41:34.900
so when he snorts,
you snort, right?

41:34.967 --> 41:36.433
- Something like that.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.633
But I'm not hooked again,
Sister, I swear.

41:38.700 --> 41:41.400
- Well, you keep doing it,
you will  be.

41:41.467 --> 41:42.500
I'm going to
talk to Vahue.

41:42.567 --> 41:43.533
- No!

41:43.600 --> 41:44.800
- No, no.
It's okay.

41:44.867 --> 41:46.333
I'll figure out a way
to confront him

41:46.400 --> 41:48.367
about his drug use
without implicating you.

41:48.433 --> 41:49.867
And you, meanwhile,

41:49.934 --> 41:52.600
you  come to the
counseling session on Thursday,

41:52.667 --> 41:56.700
and stop  doing heroin,
no matter what Vahue says, okay?

41:56.767 --> 41:57.800
- Yes, ma'am.

42:01.734 --> 42:03.166
- You know,
maybe it's time

42:03.233 --> 42:06.967
you got yourself
another hero,

42:07.033 --> 42:09.600
because to
be honest...

42:09.667 --> 42:11.233
the one
you got sucks.

42:12.033 --> 42:14.467
- You're going to do
what I tell you to do,

42:14.533 --> 42:16.367
or I'm just going to
fuck you up.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.100
- Yo, Jackson,
leave Dobbins alone, man.

42:18.166 --> 42:20.133
- You butt out
of this, all right?

42:20.200 --> 42:21.300
- I'm telling you, man,
leave him--

42:21.367 --> 42:24.133
- Yo, fuck--
fuck you!

42:24.200 --> 42:25.300
Ah!

42:25.367 --> 42:27.834
- Get the fuck
out of here, man.

42:27.900 --> 42:29.767
- Damn, what the fuck
was that about?

42:29.834 --> 42:31.500
- Yo, man, you so high on--you
was hurting him for no reason.

42:31.567 --> 42:32.867
- I don't need
no reason!

42:32.934 --> 42:34.600
- Yo, he got
a gift, man.

42:34.667 --> 42:36.433
- If you fuck
with it, it will go.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.700
- What about my gift?

42:37.767 --> 42:39.967
What about my
fucking gift?

42:40.033 --> 42:41.166
I'm dying
in here, man.

42:41.233 --> 42:42.500
- We all dying, Jackson!

42:42.567 --> 42:44.300
- That ain't
no comfort.

42:45.834 --> 42:47.867
[cello playing]

42:47.934 --> 42:50.066
- We all got problems...

42:50.133 --> 42:52.900
Impossible problems.

42:52.967 --> 42:54.500
And then we
meet someone,

42:54.567 --> 42:56.533
who's got bigger problems
than we have.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.300
Or at least, they can't
handle their problems as well.

42:59.367 --> 43:01.667
And somehow,
their weakness...

43:01.734 --> 43:03.867
gives us strength.

43:03.934 --> 43:05.734
[trumpet joins in with cello]

43:05.800 --> 43:09.467
Simple truth number 62:

43:09.533 --> 43:10.567
you help someone...

43:11.467 --> 43:13.600
You help yourself.

43:13.667 --> 43:15.767
[classical duet continues]

43:35.767 --> 43:39.667
So I did what
Sister Peter Marie said.

43:39.734 --> 43:41.767
I got myself
another hero.

43:41.834 --> 43:42.867
And who'd've guessed...

43:44.300 --> 43:46.033
It's me.

43:46.100 --> 43:48.333
Yeah...

43:48.400 --> 43:50.467
I'm proud,
'cause my plan worked.

43:50.533 --> 43:52.266
I did my best.

43:57.133 --> 44:00.400
But unfortunately
for Dobbins, my best--

44:00.467 --> 44:02.667
it ain't good enough.

44:11.967 --> 44:14.633
- Hey, Nino, you want to
play some pinochle?

44:14.700 --> 44:17.533
- I'm in the middle
of a conversation here.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.867
What fucking bog
did you grow up on?

44:19.934 --> 44:21.800
You stupid
mick bastard.

44:21.867 --> 44:26.133
Now get the fuck
out of here!

44:26.200 --> 44:27.567
- Hey, O'Reily.
- What?

44:27.633 --> 44:28.633
- What do you think those two
are talking about?

44:28.700 --> 44:30.266
- How the fuck
would I know, Ross?

44:30.333 --> 44:31.533
- Seem strange to you,
Nino Schibetta,

44:31.600 --> 44:32.667
fucking mob guy,

44:32.734 --> 44:35.066
chatting with the
nigger of Islam?

44:35.133 --> 44:36.700
- Get lost.

44:36.767 --> 44:39.033
Come here...

44:39.100 --> 44:41.333
I've been
hearing shit.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.700
- Yeah, me, too.

44:42.767 --> 44:44.000
The Muslims are
going to start a riot.

44:44.066 --> 44:45.300
- Yeah.

44:45.367 --> 44:47.266
Rumor has it that they're
armed to the teeth.

44:47.333 --> 44:48.633
I'm talking guns,

44:48.700 --> 44:50.233
they've organized
every cellblock.

44:50.300 --> 44:52.200
- If they take
charge, me and you

44:52.266 --> 44:54.200
can kiss our
white asses good-bye.

44:54.266 --> 44:55.333
- Yo, maybe Schibetta's just
making

44:55.400 --> 44:56.633
some kind of a deal
with Said.

44:56.700 --> 44:59.033
- Then how come we
don't know about it?

44:59.100 --> 45:02.400
Maybe the old wop's saving
himself by giving you up.

45:02.467 --> 45:04.200
- You're right,
we need to get organized.

45:04.266 --> 45:05.633
- Definitely.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.300
You got a card in your deck
nobody knows about.

45:08.367 --> 45:09.533
- Adebisi?

45:09.600 --> 45:11.033
- Yeah.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.433
- He hates Said
as much as we do.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.734
- Wouldn't hurt to have
a couple of homeboys

45:14.800 --> 45:15.767
on our side.

45:15.834 --> 45:17.567
- I'll talk to him.

45:22.734 --> 45:24.467
- You ready?
- Almost.

45:24.533 --> 45:27.333
Look, I saw Said
talking to Schibetta.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.767
You think Said knows about the
two of us putting glass

45:28.834 --> 45:31.133
in Schibetta's food?

45:31.200 --> 45:32.467
- How would he know?

45:32.533 --> 45:34.734
- Listen, Adebisi, you hear
any rumblings

45:34.800 --> 45:36.700
about the Muslims
wanting to start a riot?

45:36.767 --> 45:38.233
Stop that!

45:38.300 --> 45:39.667
- Sure, you know.

45:39.734 --> 45:42.533
- If it happens, where are
you going to land?

45:42.600 --> 45:44.467
- On my feet,
as always.

45:44.533 --> 45:48.333
- Hey, we supply tits to this
whole fuckin' prison, all right?

45:48.400 --> 45:50.667
Those doily-heads are
going to gun for us.

45:50.734 --> 45:52.600
- Don't worry bro,
I got your back.

45:52.667 --> 45:53.967
- That's all I
need to know.

45:54.033 --> 45:55.800
- How long is it going to
take before he dies?

45:55.867 --> 45:57.967
- I don't know, it's not exactly
an exact science,

45:58.033 --> 46:00.133
you know what I'm saying?

46:00.200 --> 46:01.900
- I want him...

46:01.967 --> 46:03.000
Dead.

46:04.367 --> 46:05.300
Bon appetit.

46:05.367 --> 46:06.667
[gate buzzes]

46:16.834 --> 46:20.133
- Here you go, Nino.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.100
What, you
don't like it?

46:22.166 --> 46:23.500
I'll get you
something else.

46:23.567 --> 46:24.900
- No, I'm just not
hungry, that's all.

46:24.967 --> 46:26.133
- Is your stomach
still bothering you?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.467
- Yeah!

46:27.533 --> 46:29.800
- I told you to
go to the doctor.

46:33.033 --> 46:36.233
- We got a huge pair
of tits coming in tomorrow.

46:36.300 --> 46:37.600
Tell your...

46:38.900 --> 46:42.467
Tell your pal Adebisi to
get his boys ready to run.

46:42.533 --> 46:43.600
- You got it.

46:44.967 --> 46:46.900
Say, Nino...

46:46.967 --> 46:48.500
Anything going down
I should know about,

46:48.567 --> 46:51.400
between us
and Said, I mean?

46:51.467 --> 46:52.500
- No...

46:53.867 --> 46:56.633
But you would know,

46:56.700 --> 46:58.834
when you're
supposed to know.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.033
I'm going to
go lie down.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.800
- Hey, Dobbins,
you want a salad?

47:18.533 --> 47:21.233
- Flush and
40-40 jacks.

47:21.300 --> 47:24.200
- I got a marriage
and I got 100 aces.

47:24.266 --> 47:25.967
Nino...

47:28.600 --> 47:30.734
- Jesus Christ.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.367
What the fuck
is that from?

47:33.867 --> 47:35.000
Jesus!

47:35.700 --> 47:37.767
What the fuck?

47:38.967 --> 47:40.900
- Nino, Nino!

47:42.834 --> 47:45.133
- Hey, hey, you don't
look so good, man.

47:46.934 --> 47:48.834
- Christ!

47:48.900 --> 47:50.734
- Hello, Kareem.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.834
- Guess you heard

47:51.900 --> 47:53.800
what happened
to Schibetta.

47:53.867 --> 47:55.333
- Oh, yes...

47:55.400 --> 47:57.133
Now, that was unusual.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.300
The man was hemorrhaging
throughout his body.

47:59.367 --> 48:01.066
Now, I wonder
what caused that.

48:01.133 --> 48:02.367
- Bad diet?

48:02.433 --> 48:05.533
- Too much garlic.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.066
- Is the man
going to recover?

48:07.133 --> 48:09.266
- The doctor says
he's got a chance.

48:09.333 --> 48:10.767
- - So meanwhile...

48:14.066 --> 48:15.800
We are in charge
of his operation.

48:15.867 --> 48:17.233
So any business
you had with him

48:17.300 --> 48:18.633
has to go through us.

48:18.700 --> 48:21.633
- Business? I had no business
with Schibetta.

48:21.700 --> 48:23.467
- You better not
be lying.

48:23.533 --> 48:25.400
- Is that
a warning?

48:25.467 --> 48:26.967
- Yeah.

48:27.033 --> 48:28.767
- Well, I have a warning
for the two of you:

48:28.834 --> 48:32.533
change your ways, or you will
suffer the wrath of God.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.967
- God?

48:34.033 --> 48:35.300
I don't see
any God.

48:35.367 --> 48:36.600
- No God here.

48:36.667 --> 48:38.133
- All I see
is you,

48:38.200 --> 48:40.033
and your
bad heart.

48:40.100 --> 48:41.934
- You have it
so wrong.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.800
- I have a weak heart
and you...

48:46.867 --> 48:48.533
have the
bad heart.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.567
You can
keep my watch.

48:50.633 --> 48:51.567
- Thank you.

48:51.633 --> 48:52.600
- He's right.

48:52.667 --> 48:54.800
You do have
a bad heart.

48:54.867 --> 48:55.900
- What can I say?

48:55.967 --> 48:57.967
I'm a bad-heart
motherfucker.

49:01.867 --> 49:03.800
- I'll take this one.

49:07.700 --> 49:08.934
Hey, Nino.

49:09.500 --> 49:12.166
Remember when you called me
a "stupid mick bastard"?

49:12.233 --> 49:13.600
Huh?

49:13.667 --> 49:17.066
I ain't so
stupid now, am I?

49:17.133 --> 49:18.834
Open up.

49:18.900 --> 49:21.166
Sorry, we're
out of tomatoes.

49:26.100 --> 49:28.367
- If you listen to the poets,
they'll tell you that

49:28.433 --> 49:31.633
a big, bad event in
someone's life changes them.

49:31.700 --> 49:34.400
If you lose the woman
you love or your legs,

49:34.467 --> 49:38.133
you suddenly find a kind of
beauty inside yourself.

49:38.200 --> 49:41.100
That's what they say,
the poets.

49:41.166 --> 49:43.333
Truth is, you don't.

49:44.967 --> 49:47.600
After a big, bad event,

49:47.667 --> 49:50.567
you only become more of the
person you already were.

49:59.667 --> 50:01.500
- Get out,
motherfucker.

50:01.567 --> 50:03.200
- Get a fucking doctor!

50:03.266 --> 50:06.967
- Fucking bitch,
how does that feel, you cunt?

50:07.033 --> 50:08.433
- Beecher, you're
a dead man!

50:08.500 --> 50:10.867
- If you're afraid Schillinger's
gonna kill you,

50:10.934 --> 50:13.333
I'll place you under
