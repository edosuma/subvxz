<i>Well, hello, darling.</i>

00:15.136 --> 00:16.668
First time to London?

00:18.009 --> 00:19.503
Have fun.

00:24.945 --> 00:26.612
Excuse me.

00:26.614 --> 00:28.747
Little girl, where are your parents?

00:28.749 --> 00:30.347
My parents?

00:30.785 --> 00:32.683
They'rethey're already on the plane.

00:32.686 --> 00:34.052
Are you sure?

00:34.054 --> 00:35.454
You know you're not allowed
aboard the plane

00:35.456 --> 00:37.159
without an adult accompanying you.

00:37.161 --> 00:38.424
Don't worry.

00:38.426 --> 00:40.274
I'll find them once I get on board.

00:44.198 --> 00:46.765
Hello. Excuse me, miss?

00:48.569 --> 00:51.403
Little girl, we have your passport,

00:51.405 --> 00:53.639
so it's just a matter of
time before we figure out

00:53.641 --> 00:56.041
who your parents are and
how to contact them.

00:56.043 --> 00:58.834
Or you could just give us
their names and numbers.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.647
Keep dreamin', copper.

01:06.020 --> 01:07.686
There you are.

01:09.089 --> 01:10.489
I see you.

01:12.126 --> 01:14.893
Charlie, do you have any idea
what you've put me through?

01:14.895 --> 01:16.028
Excuse me. You her mother?

01:16.030 --> 01:17.463
No. I'm the nanny.

01:17.853 --> 01:19.932
Here is a notarized letter

01:19.934 --> 01:22.441
from her father authorizing
me to take her home.

01:25.206 --> 01:26.972
Do you have any idea
what would have happened

01:26.974 --> 01:28.947
if they'd let you on that plane?

01:32.513 --> 01:34.179
Thank you, Officer.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.496
This won't happen again.

01:35.783 --> 01:37.149
So you got it?

01:37.151 --> 01:38.817
We got it.

01:38.819 --> 01:40.752
At triple our usual fee.

01:40.754 --> 01:42.387
How'd you pull that off?

01:42.389 --> 01:44.523
I promised them we'd win.

01:44.525 --> 01:46.925
And we'd do it before the
end of the fiscal year.

01:46.927 --> 01:49.528
Which basically means before Christmas.

01:49.530 --> 01:52.364
But, that's in five days.

01:52.596 --> 01:54.433
You serious?

01:54.435 --> 01:56.009
You can't be serious.

01:56.011 --> 01:58.770
Boys and girls, moms and dads,

01:58.772 --> 02:02.307
dogs and cats, gather 'round and meet...

02:02.309 --> 02:04.209
our new client.

02:06.714 --> 02:09.514
Wow. So we're defending an object?

02:09.517 --> 02:11.917
We are defending the creators.

02:14.455 --> 02:17.222
A tech behemoth that is being
sued for patent infringement

02:17.224 --> 02:19.291
by ZOKEN, manufacturers

02:19.293 --> 02:22.828
of one of the largestselling
phones in the world.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.891
And they claim there are a number of...

02:24.893 --> 02:26.965
notable design similarities.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.233
My.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.168
Although ZOKEN phone sells for
almost twice as much

02:30.170 --> 02:31.603
as the SAWAGI.

02:31.605 --> 02:33.739
So we're representing the cheap knockoff?

02:33.741 --> 02:34.940
We are defending

02:34.942 --> 02:36.475
the realistically priced alternative.

02:36.477 --> 02:38.544
And being paid a boatload
of money to do it.

02:38.546 --> 02:40.445
Thank goodness.
I felt morally compromised

02:40.447 --> 02:41.547
for a moment.

02:41.549 --> 02:42.881
Trust me.

02:42.883 --> 02:45.651
We will be earning every penny
of our enormous fee.

02:45.653 --> 02:47.119
What makes you say that?

02:47.121 --> 02:48.520
This needs to be wrapped up by Christmas.

02:48.522 --> 02:49.555
You'll pardon the pun.

02:49.557 --> 02:50.789
This Christmas?

02:50.791 --> 02:52.457
Bull, that's five days.

02:52.459 --> 02:54.359
Wow. You and Benny

02:54.361 --> 02:55.827
can count to five. Now, come on.

02:55.829 --> 02:57.029
It's not like I said Christmas Eve.

02:57.031 --> 02:59.482
Besides, you guys thrive under pressure.

02:59.484 --> 03:01.533
Now, hop to it.

03:01.535 --> 03:03.235
I want this entire jury pool vetted

03:03.237 --> 03:04.835
before the end of the day.

03:14.682 --> 03:16.179
My gosh.

03:17.351 --> 03:18.765
What's your name?

03:19.153 --> 03:21.119
And who do you belong to? Marissa!

03:21.121 --> 03:23.288
Is it "Bring Your Brat
to Work Day" again?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.223
One of those things wandered in here.

03:25.225 --> 03:26.692
Hi.

03:26.694 --> 03:27.926
Are you lost, sweetie?

03:27.928 --> 03:30.062
This is Dr. Bull's office, right?

03:30.064 --> 03:31.163
Yes.

03:31.165 --> 03:32.364
And that's Dr. Bull?

03:32.366 --> 03:33.799
Yes.

03:33.801 --> 03:36.168
Nope. I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.070
I'm here on official business.

03:38.072 --> 03:39.661
I need to get divorced.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.574
You're married?

03:42.576 --> 03:45.677
No. I need to get divorced
from my parents.

03:46.543 --> 03:48.013
Okay.

03:48.015 --> 03:49.581
Um...

03:51.285 --> 03:53.118
So, here's the thing,
divorce is for people

03:53.120 --> 03:55.354
who are married to each other.

03:55.356 --> 03:58.388
I think maybe the thing you want
to be is emancipated.

03:58.792 --> 04:01.927
That means that you are no
longer dependent on your parents

04:01.929 --> 04:04.429
and they are no longer
legally responsible for you.

04:04.431 --> 04:06.765
- Okay, I'll go with that.
- Problem is,

04:06.767 --> 04:10.335
in the State of New York, the
legal age of emancipation is 16.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.703
How old are you?

04:12.778 --> 04:14.339
16.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.875
You know, the penalty for lying
about something like this

04:17.878 --> 04:19.678
is 25 years hard labor.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.011
15. Knew it.

04:21.012 --> 04:24.683
But... maybe they can make an exception?

04:24.685 --> 04:26.885
Little girl, I'm not a lawyer,

04:26.887 --> 04:30.055
so even if there was an
exception to be made,

04:30.057 --> 04:32.124
I'm not the guy to get it for you.

04:32.126 --> 04:34.092
Now, I have got a lot of work to do,

04:34.094 --> 04:35.861
and I'm sure there is someplace
you are supposed to be,

04:35.863 --> 04:37.729
so I'm gonna give you
to that very nice lady

04:37.731 --> 04:39.231
who was standing by the door with me,

04:39.233 --> 04:40.953
and she is gonna see
about getting you home.

04:44.538 --> 04:46.061
It was nice to have met you.

04:47.312 --> 04:48.740
And you.

04:48.742 --> 04:50.208
And do you have a name?

04:50.210 --> 04:52.878
Charlotte Kensington,
but you can call me Charlie.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.479
Okay, Charlie.

04:54.481 --> 04:56.114
When you turn 16,

04:56.116 --> 04:58.316
if this is something you
still want, come and see me.

04:58.318 --> 05:00.419
Marissa!

05:00.421 --> 05:01.787
You yelled for me, sir?

05:01.789 --> 05:03.522
I am entrusting you to get Charlie here

05:03.524 --> 05:05.200
home safe and sound.

05:05.202 --> 05:06.998
I'll do my best.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.908
It's almost 9:00.

05:31.910 --> 05:34.043
What do you say we close up and go home?

05:34.045 --> 05:35.512
Well, I would if I could.

05:35.514 --> 05:36.980
I am still trying to reach somebody

05:36.982 --> 05:38.581
to come get our little girl.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.849
What do you mean?

05:39.851 --> 05:40.984
Where is she?

05:40.986 --> 05:42.585
Well, she wanted some chicken fingers,

05:42.587 --> 05:44.854
so Cable took her down to the corner.

05:44.856 --> 05:47.156
Okay.

05:47.158 --> 05:49.058
You go home. I'll take care of this.

05:55.967 --> 05:57.549
Young lady.

05:58.592 --> 06:01.070
Um, which young lady do you mean?

06:01.595 --> 06:02.872
Go home, Cable.

06:04.175 --> 06:05.675
Bye.

06:11.683 --> 06:13.440
Okay.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.554
It's late, and I'm no longer amused.

06:17.556 --> 06:20.023
Had you not come here
today, where would you be?

06:20.530 --> 06:21.624
Home.

06:21.626 --> 06:22.926
And where is that?

06:22.928 --> 06:25.562
SoHo. Corner of Macdougal and King.

06:25.564 --> 06:27.363
Is there someone there waiting for you?

06:27.704 --> 06:29.664
Do you have a way of getting in
to your apartment?

06:30.957 --> 06:33.202
Then that is where we're going.

06:39.477 --> 06:43.479
So, is that nice blonde lady
in your office your girlfriend?

06:43.481 --> 06:46.449
No. She's just a nice
blonde lady in my office.

06:46.451 --> 06:50.587
A very smart, nice blonde lady.

06:50.589 --> 06:52.622
You married?

06:52.624 --> 06:54.272
No.

06:54.859 --> 06:56.025
How 'bout you?

06:56.027 --> 06:57.260
Wait.

06:57.262 --> 06:58.661
We've already had this conversation.

06:58.663 --> 07:00.396
You're funny.

07:00.398 --> 07:04.133
No. I'm just old and you're just young,

07:04.135 --> 07:06.469
and you've never heard my jokes before.

07:09.204 --> 07:11.240
Look, that thing you came to my office

07:11.242 --> 07:13.276
to discuss with me...

07:13.750 --> 07:16.012
You got to know, at one point or another,

07:16.014 --> 07:18.314
every kid wants to divorce their parents.

07:18.922 --> 07:21.918
Every kid wants to run
away and join the circus,

07:21.920 --> 07:24.886
or a rock band, or a dangerous cult.

07:25.595 --> 07:26.923
It'll pass.

07:27.759 --> 07:29.292
And besides,

07:29.294 --> 07:30.860
it's almost Christmas.

07:30.862 --> 07:33.396
If Santa gets a whiff of some of
the stuff you've been up to,

07:33.398 --> 07:36.065
you are gonna screw up

07:36.067 --> 07:37.667
that whole present thing.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.306
Okay, squirt.

07:43.308 --> 07:45.441
My work here is done.

07:45.949 --> 07:48.177
Handing you over to the doorman.

07:48.451 --> 07:50.313
Sweet dreams.

07:52.851 --> 07:54.851
Can you come up and put me to bed?

07:57.856 --> 07:59.789
Really, you don't want that.

07:59.791 --> 08:01.190
Honest.

08:01.192 --> 08:03.926
I'm, like, the worst at that.

08:03.928 --> 08:05.862
I mean, I'll make
you brush your teeth,

08:05.864 --> 08:06.796
and wash your face,

08:06.798 --> 08:09.832
and do multiplication tables.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.968
I mean, lit's not gonna be pretty.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.611
Okay. What do I owe you?

08:27.185 --> 08:29.352
Wow.

08:30.221 --> 08:32.037
This is big.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.792
They make you wear a GPS?

08:35.794 --> 08:38.327
Hello! Anyone home?

08:38.328 --> 08:41.063
No. The lights were off,
which means no one's home.

08:41.066 --> 08:43.506
My dad usually works pretty late.

08:46.104 --> 08:47.677
What about your mom?

08:48.640 --> 08:51.056
She went away a while ago.

08:51.509 --> 08:53.433
Okay.

08:54.412 --> 08:56.846
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

08:56.848 --> 08:59.215
Putting on my nightgown,
so you can tuck me in.

08:59.988 --> 09:00.988
Excellent.

09:01.430 --> 09:02.457
And then...

09:03.088 --> 09:05.488
can you stay until my dad gets home?

09:06.613 --> 09:07.890
Excuse me?

09:07.892 --> 09:10.241
Can you stay until my dad gets home?

09:10.795 --> 09:13.129
I get really lonely.

09:24.676 --> 09:27.009
Whoa.

09:27.011 --> 09:30.926
Just... who are you?
What are you doing here?

09:30.928 --> 09:32.014
And where is my daughter?

09:32.016 --> 09:33.382
Okay, whoa, whoa.

09:33.384 --> 09:34.851
Charlie is fine.

09:34.853 --> 09:36.486
She's sleeping in her room.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.154
Go, look.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.334
Okay. Hey, just hold it right there.

09:51.336 --> 09:53.617
I've already called the police,
they're on their way over.

09:53.824 --> 09:55.805
Look, II know this couldn't
look any worse,

09:55.807 --> 09:58.207
but... let me explain.

09:58.209 --> 10:00.301
- My name is Dr. Jason Bull.
- You're a doctor?

10:00.303 --> 10:01.444
A psychologist,

10:01.446 --> 10:02.879
but that's beside the point.

10:02.881 --> 10:05.214
Your daughter came to my office
looking to hire me.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.450
Why would my nineyearold daughter

10:07.452 --> 10:09.018
want to hire a psychologist?

10:09.020 --> 10:12.522
I'm a trial scientist,
a kind of legal expert.

10:12.524 --> 10:16.337
She wanted a divorce from you,

10:16.339 --> 10:17.660
and your wife,

10:17.662 --> 10:19.395
and I didn't know what else to do.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.731
So I brought her home.

10:21.733 --> 10:25.101
She didn't want me to leave,
not until you got home.

10:25.103 --> 10:28.938
And it is... 2:30 in the morning.

10:28.940 --> 10:31.239
Yeah. Okay. Um...

10:32.741 --> 10:34.577
Thank you, I guess.

10:35.076 --> 10:36.979
You guess?

10:37.328 --> 10:38.481
You and your wife always leave

10:38.483 --> 10:40.116
your nineyearold alone at night?

10:40.118 --> 10:41.851
We have a nanny four days a week.

10:41.853 --> 10:44.169
This is her night off.

10:44.689 --> 10:46.122
We'rewe're in a doorman building.

10:46.124 --> 10:48.324
Uh16 cameras.

10:48.326 --> 10:50.193
WhWhich I can watch on my phone.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.596
We've got more security than Fort Knox.

10:53.598 --> 10:55.349
She'sshe's perfectly safe, thank you.

10:55.351 --> 10:56.966
She's perfectly comfortable with it.

10:56.968 --> 10:59.669
And that's why she pleaded
with me not to leave her alone.

10:59.671 --> 11:00.870
She's a kid.

11:00.872 --> 11:02.939
You ever look at these security
cameras that you have?

11:02.941 --> 11:05.842
'Cause if you had,
you would've seen a stranger

11:05.844 --> 11:08.211
wandering around this palace of yours.

11:08.213 --> 11:09.946
Okay, obviously, I didn't, so...

11:10.445 --> 11:12.982
Again, thank you.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.651
You know what,

11:16.034 --> 11:17.653
I'm gonna wait for the police.

11:18.953 --> 11:20.656
I didn't call them.

11:20.955 --> 11:22.158
I didn't call anyone.

11:24.918 --> 11:25.962
Then you're lucky.

11:25.964 --> 11:28.865
Because I think they would find
what I have to say

11:28.867 --> 11:32.168
a lot more interesting
than what you have to say.

11:34.469 --> 11:37.406
Give your daughter a kiss
for me, Mr. Kensington.

11:37.806 --> 11:40.243
And have a merry Christmas.

11:45.583 --> 11:53.583
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

11:58.321 --> 11:59.686
All right, I'm here.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.119
Now, what's so important?

12:02.705 --> 12:05.723
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look like an unmade bed.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.160
Well, an unmade bed sounds
pretty good to me right now.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.476
I was out pretty late.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.047
Now, what is so important?

12:15.049 --> 12:18.730
Well, I pored over
all this stuff last night.

12:18.732 --> 12:21.753
And I am no computer geek, okay?

12:21.755 --> 12:25.791
But it seems to me
that every single improvement,

12:25.793 --> 12:28.927
every single modification
in SAWAGI's phone,

12:28.929 --> 12:31.663
in ZOKEN's phone, is all built

12:31.665 --> 12:34.800
on an underlying technology
that somebody else pioneered.

12:35.836 --> 12:37.903
Company A will improve
on whatever Company B

12:37.905 --> 12:40.305
came out with, and Company B
will return the favor

12:40.307 --> 12:43.175
by taking whatever seems most exciting

12:43.177 --> 12:44.943
about Company A's work

12:44.945 --> 12:47.646
and changing it just enough
to make it seem

12:47.648 --> 12:49.715
like something original.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.250
They all do it.

12:51.252 --> 12:52.918
It's very incestuous.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.952
Point being?

12:53.954 --> 12:55.699
Point being is

12:55.701 --> 12:58.090
I think we go into the judge's chambers,

12:58.092 --> 12:59.891
present this properly,

12:59.893 --> 13:02.761
justify a motion to dismiss.

13:04.798 --> 13:06.265
No muss, no fuss.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.399
Four days early.

13:08.535 --> 13:10.402
We all go Christmas shopping.

13:10.404 --> 13:12.204
I take it you've already
called the judge.

13:12.206 --> 13:14.139
They're gonna text us
as soon as he's free.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.862
Nice work.

13:20.347 --> 13:23.348
I'm gonna take a quick stroll
over to family court.

13:23.350 --> 13:26.151
If they text you, you text me.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.253
Your Honor, sorry to bother you.

13:28.255 --> 13:30.088
My name is Dr. Jason Bull.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.156
I'm a trial scientist.

13:31.586 --> 13:33.525
- What can I do for you?
- Well,

13:33.527 --> 13:35.127
I'm a licensed psychologist,

13:35.129 --> 13:37.829
which means that I am a mandated reporter

13:37.831 --> 13:40.565
when it comes to situations
regarding child welfare.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.567
And...

13:42.569 --> 13:44.303
I'm staring at a situation.

13:44.305 --> 13:46.405
I'm just not sure it rises to the level

13:46.407 --> 13:47.806
that justifies reporting.

13:47.808 --> 13:49.241
What's the situation?

13:49.243 --> 13:51.043
Busy, working family.

13:51.045 --> 13:52.144
Rolling in money.

13:52.146 --> 13:53.679
Best of everything for their little girl.

13:53.681 --> 13:54.713
She's nine years old.

13:54.715 --> 13:56.682
But, unfortunately,

13:56.684 --> 13:58.451
she is often left unsupervised.

13:58.453 --> 14:01.453
Just yesterday, she wandered
30 blocks to come and see me.

14:01.455 --> 14:04.156
And then, last night, I was
at her apartment with her

14:04.158 --> 14:07.080
until 2:30 in the morning,
waiting for a parent to show up.

14:09.290 --> 14:11.396
Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?

14:12.710 --> 14:14.633
Well, you usually don't see
this kind of thing

14:14.635 --> 14:16.339
in affluent families, but...

14:17.090 --> 14:19.237
the prudent thing to do
would be to at least

14:19.239 --> 14:20.739
open an investigation.

14:21.302 --> 14:22.274
Thank you.

14:22.276 --> 14:23.942
I thought so, too.

14:23.944 --> 14:25.644
Email me all the relevant information.

14:25.646 --> 14:27.212
I'll take it from there.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.947
Fantastic. Thank you.

14:28.949 --> 14:30.853
Just one more thing, Doctor.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.151
In these type of cases,

14:33.153 --> 14:35.987
we normally assign the child
a guardian ad litem,

14:35.989 --> 14:38.156
an objective third party
whose sole job is

14:38.158 --> 14:40.192
to look out for the child's
best interests

14:40.194 --> 14:42.527
as his or her case
moves through the courts.

14:42.529 --> 14:43.829
Makes sense.

14:43.831 --> 14:45.464
We also look to the guardian ad litem

14:45.466 --> 14:47.466
to make a recommendation to the judge.

14:47.468 --> 14:49.267
The judge has the final say,

14:49.269 --> 14:51.169
but the guardian ad litem's opinion

14:51.171 --> 14:52.583
carries a great deal of weight.

14:53.173 --> 14:54.840
Sounds like a terrific system.

14:54.842 --> 14:57.309
I'm sure this little girl's
gonna be in fantastic hands.

14:57.311 --> 14:59.311
Finding someone to fill that
role the week before Christmas

14:59.313 --> 15:01.384
is going to be exceedingly difficult.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.483
But you, Dr. Bull,
are a licensed psychologist,

15:04.485 --> 15:06.585
and you're already familiar
with the case.

15:06.587 --> 15:08.186
Your Honor,

15:08.188 --> 15:10.555
I promise you, I would if I could.

15:10.557 --> 15:13.625
- I am drowning in work.
- If I can't find a guardian,

15:13.627 --> 15:15.523
I can't start an investigation.

15:16.399 --> 15:19.664
Well, then maybe it's a sign.

15:21.535 --> 15:22.864
That was a joke.

15:23.740 --> 15:26.037
You'll laugh later.

15:27.307 --> 15:28.740
I'm your guy.

15:28.742 --> 15:29.773
Thank you.

15:29.775 --> 15:32.511
And happy holidays, Dr. Bull.

15:33.082 --> 15:36.044
Here's hoping, Judge Sullivan.

15:37.128 --> 15:39.418
Guess what, judge won't even see us.

15:39.420 --> 15:42.120
Says the issues are
way too complex simply to

15:42.122 --> 15:43.755
dismiss the case without
hearing testimony.

15:43.757 --> 15:46.215
Well, it's Christmastime.
What'd you expect, a miracle?

15:48.262 --> 15:50.896
Hey, what if I told you if one
of our client's lead engineers

15:50.898 --> 15:53.064
spent the first 18 months
of his career working

15:53.066 --> 15:55.467
at the Palo Alto campus of the plaintiff?

15:55.469 --> 15:56.735
In the cellular division.

15:56.737 --> 15:58.537
It sounds worse than it is.

15:58.539 --> 16:00.472
Like I said before,
it's a small community.

16:00.474 --> 16:02.340
People move from company
to company all the time.

16:02.342 --> 16:04.609
Okay. You know what we need to do?

16:04.611 --> 16:06.745
We need to do an analysis
of every patent filed

16:06.747 --> 16:08.113
for both these phones.

16:08.115 --> 16:11.049
And we need to highlight
the layered changes

16:11.051 --> 16:13.218
that take place in every device,

16:13.220 --> 16:15.554
that every manufacturer
is, in fact, reacting

16:15.556 --> 16:18.423
to the latest improvements
of every other manufacturer

16:18.425 --> 16:21.092
and that there is, inevitably, overlap.

16:21.094 --> 16:22.928
Steve Jobs visits Xerox,

16:22.930 --> 16:25.030
sees what amounts
to a graphical user interface,

16:25.032 --> 16:27.199
goes back to Apple, does it better,

16:27.201 --> 16:28.834
and the home computer is born.

16:28.836 --> 16:31.436
It's not thievery... it's evolution.

16:31.438 --> 16:34.539
Then we got to try and get execs
from all the other companies

16:34.541 --> 16:36.308
in the cell phone business
to back this...

16:36.310 --> 16:39.511
shared zeitgeist narrative
of ours in court.

16:39.513 --> 16:41.746
And you want all of that
before Christmas?

16:41.748 --> 16:46.017
There are thousands of pages
of filings to read through.

16:46.019 --> 16:48.854
Then we'd better get started.

16:57.698 --> 16:59.965
Judge Sullivan
from family court is on one.

16:59.967 --> 17:01.546
Sure. Put him through.

17:01.548 --> 17:03.502
Don't ask.

17:03.504 --> 17:05.002
I'll be back.

17:05.005 --> 17:06.634
Walk with me.

17:08.511 --> 17:10.942
Go to my office where no one can hear.

17:10.944 --> 17:13.078
I'm gonna call you from the car.

17:13.079 --> 17:16.681
I need you to tell me everything
you can about family court.

17:16.683 --> 17:18.250
Family court?

17:18.252 --> 17:19.751
What did you do?

17:19.752 --> 17:22.087
It's the season.

17:22.089 --> 17:24.289
I tried to do something nice.

17:35.146 --> 17:37.193
Judge William Sullivan.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.384
Fiercely protective of children.

17:40.385 --> 17:42.218
Rarely sides with parents.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.519
Good to know.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.755
Family court
is like a foreign country to me.

17:45.757 --> 17:46.789
No juries.

17:46.791 --> 17:48.424
It's all about the judge.

17:48.426 --> 17:53.596
Now, see what you can tell me
about Rex and Nora Kensington.

17:53.598 --> 17:54.664
Is this about the little girl

17:54.666 --> 17:56.099
that was in the office yesterday?

17:56.101 --> 17:58.601
Ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

17:58.936 --> 18:00.336
Nothing new here.

18:00.338 --> 18:02.271
Owns his own investment firm,

18:02.273 --> 18:04.240
which he built from the ground up.

18:04.242 --> 18:06.743
Looks very good in a suit.

18:06.745 --> 18:08.945
- What was the wife's name again?
- Nora.

18:08.947 --> 18:11.032
Got it. Nora Kensington.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.185
Marissa?

18:16.187 --> 18:17.788
You there? Did I lose you?

18:18.223 --> 18:19.790
No, I'm here.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.025
She passed away.

18:23.027 --> 18:24.660
Three years ago.

18:24.962 --> 18:26.380
Breast cancer.

18:50.321 --> 18:53.321
Neglect? They're having me tried
for neglect?

18:53.323 --> 18:57.727
Okay, look, I'm starting to realize
I might owe you an apology.

18:57.729 --> 19:00.062
This thing is clearly spinning
out of control.

19:00.064 --> 19:01.964
I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.167
So just let me go talk to the
judge. I'm sure I can undo this.

19:04.169 --> 19:06.335
No, no. They've already moved
Charlie out of our apartment.

19:06.337 --> 19:07.737
She's not allowed to live with me

19:07.739 --> 19:08.838
until this hearing is over.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.373
And maybe not even then.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.375
It's Christmastime.

19:12.377 --> 19:15.402
She's got to stay with the nanny
in the apartment downstairs.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.712
Again, I'm sorry.

19:16.714 --> 19:17.914
This was never my intention.

19:17.916 --> 19:20.183
I just went to the judge
for some advice, and I...

19:20.185 --> 19:21.884
Where is Charlie?

19:22.186 --> 19:23.719
You know, if she and I
go talk to the judge,

19:23.721 --> 19:24.787
I'm sure I can undo this.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.088
They won't let you see her.

19:26.090 --> 19:27.356
They won't let anyone see her.

19:27.358 --> 19:29.859
They've got her in the back
with her lawyer.

19:31.229 --> 19:32.562
They got her a lawyer.

19:34.532 --> 19:36.365
Anyone with business
before Judge Sullivan

19:36.367 --> 19:38.334
in the matter of Charlotte Kensington,

19:38.336 --> 19:40.469
please make your way into the courtroom.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.438
Hearing will start in five minutes.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.418
I promise you, I will handle this.

19:47.169 --> 19:48.878
<i>No, I know</i>

19:48.880 --> 19:50.213
the rent is eight days late.

19:50.215 --> 19:53.015
I'm just having some... liquidity issues.

19:53.017 --> 19:56.178
But I believe everything will be
resolved in a day or two.

19:56.955 --> 19:59.989
Please, it's my mother's apartment.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.935
She's lived there for four years
and I've never missed a payment.

20:03.874 --> 20:04.906
Yes.

20:05.196 --> 20:06.796
- I'lll'll hold.
- Marissa,

20:06.798 --> 20:08.598
you can't go AWOL on me.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.068
This whole patent is
based on an algorithm,

20:12.070 --> 20:13.970
and you are the algorithm queen

20:13.972 --> 20:15.371
and I wouldn't know an algorithm

20:15.373 --> 20:17.373
- if it bit me on the butt.
- Yes, I understand.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.775
72 hours. You have my word.

20:19.777 --> 20:22.278
I will get the money there somehow.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.146
Thank you.

20:24.148 --> 20:27.043
And... Merry Christmas.

20:29.153 --> 20:30.546
You okay?

20:31.556 --> 20:33.716
I just really need to be alone.

20:36.794 --> 20:39.128
Is there, um,

20:39.472 --> 20:40.997
anything I can do?

20:40.999 --> 20:43.601
Can I lend you some money?

20:45.970 --> 20:47.855
Marissa, please, say something.

20:48.773 --> 20:51.150
Women crying is my kryptonite.

20:52.943 --> 20:55.945
I gave him $75,000 to invest for me

20:55.947 --> 20:57.531
just before Thanksgiving.

20:58.449 --> 21:01.817
I got him an expedited passport
so he could get to China

21:01.819 --> 21:05.164
after his was... supposedly stolen.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.624
And now he's vanished
from the face of the earth.

21:08.626 --> 21:09.759
What?

21:09.761 --> 21:12.254
And all my credit cards
have been maxed out.

21:12.630 --> 21:14.590
My checking account's been emptied.

21:15.145 --> 21:16.244
Kyle?

21:16.269 --> 21:17.869
Whatever his name is.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.672
I'm glad you're amused.

21:22.674 --> 21:25.708
Did you mention this toto Danny?

21:25.710 --> 21:27.777
She only used to be with the FBI.

21:27.779 --> 21:30.299
And Cable, Cable is an ace at finding

21:30.301 --> 21:31.399
people's digital footprints.

21:31.401 --> 21:32.581
I can't tell them.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.884
I used to be with Homeland Security.

21:34.886 --> 21:37.253
A situations analyst.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.388
And he played me like a fiddle.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.324
And it was all about that passport.

21:41.326 --> 21:43.793
He knew, with my connections,
I could get it for him.

21:43.795 --> 21:46.362
The money was just icing on the cake.

21:47.331 --> 21:48.631
So he left

21:48.633 --> 21:51.544
his wallet on that bar,
knowing I would bring it to him.

21:52.637 --> 21:54.338
What a jerk I am.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.425
I've got three words for you.

21:59.677 --> 22:02.211
Cable and Danny.

22:02.213 --> 22:04.513
<i>Your Honor,</i>

22:04.515 --> 22:06.559
sidebar, if I may.

22:10.755 --> 22:13.589
Your Honor, it's become clear to me

22:13.591 --> 22:17.426
over the last few hours that
I may very well have overreacted

22:17.428 --> 22:19.328
to the events of last night.

22:20.498 --> 22:22.164
I'm not sure any of what happened

22:22.166 --> 22:24.333
rises to the level
of investigable neglect

22:24.335 --> 22:26.135
and, in fact, I'm starting to believe

22:26.137 --> 22:27.470
that what's really called for here

22:27.472 --> 22:29.472
is not breaking up this family,

22:29.474 --> 22:30.666
but rather...

22:31.409 --> 22:33.270
counseling... therapy.

22:33.272 --> 22:35.588
Well, that's what we're here
to find out, Dr. Bull.

22:36.581 --> 22:38.214
And as the guardian ad litem,

22:38.216 --> 22:40.549
I'm very interested
in your opinions and insight.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.753
I must ask, however, that you offer them

22:43.755 --> 22:44.860
at the end of the trial,

22:44.862 --> 22:46.932
rather than before it's commenced.

22:47.725 --> 22:49.393
Take a seat, please.

23:05.866 --> 23:08.544
Nora was the... conscience of our family.

23:10.053 --> 23:11.238
She... she was a poet.

23:12.245 --> 23:14.311
But more than anything, she was a mother.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.852
Where I was always about...

23:16.854 --> 23:16.919
ambition, andand accomplishment, an...

23:16.921 --> 23:18.866
ambition, andand accomplishment, and...

23:18.906 --> 23:20.090
and hard work.

23:23.294 --> 23:25.561
So when Nora was suddenly gone...

23:30.101 --> 23:31.801
I think I just doubled down
on all of that...

23:31.803 --> 23:33.780
ambition, accomplishment...
and left the things

23:33.805 --> 23:35.237
that I should have been doing
with my daughter

23:35.239 --> 23:38.067
to grandmas and aunts and nannies.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.143
Hindsight.

23:42.891 --> 23:45.314
So, the night in question...

23:45.339 --> 23:47.785
last night... what happened?

23:48.244 --> 23:51.147
Well, I got held up at work.

23:51.589 --> 23:53.500
I lost track of time.
And I know now...

23:54.292 --> 23:55.501
I made a mistake...

23:56.810 --> 23:58.137
not being there...

23:58.162 --> 24:00.529
a very serious mistake,

24:00.531 --> 24:02.015
and one that I would like to correct.

24:03.201 --> 24:05.219
If you'd just have her come back home.

24:06.704 --> 24:08.751
Thank you, Mr. Kensington.

24:13.611 --> 24:15.577
Before we move on,

24:15.580 --> 24:18.763
can you please tell us how many
other times this has happened,

24:18.788 --> 24:20.378
where Charlie has been left alone,

24:20.403 --> 24:23.733
unsupervised, for upwards
of three hours or more?

24:23.758 --> 24:26.716
Objection. My client
has acknowledged his failings

24:26.891 --> 24:28.357
and pledged to correct them.

24:28.359 --> 24:29.359
I love my daughter.

24:30.528 --> 24:32.895
And seeing those child services
people at my door...

24:33.230 --> 24:35.564
and telling me to pack her things...

24:35.566 --> 24:38.471
I promise you, this will never,
ever happen again.

24:39.403 --> 24:41.537
And whatever the court requires me to do

24:41.539 --> 24:42.699
to win back its confidence...

24:43.691 --> 24:45.574
I'm prepared to do it.

24:46.135 --> 24:47.209
That's very

24:47.234 --> 24:50.572
admirable of you, sir.
But being a good parent...

24:50.679 --> 24:52.126
a good father.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.020
Involves more than
making pledges to do good.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.650
It involves knowing your child.

24:57.675 --> 24:59.776
I do know my child. I do.

25:00.224 --> 25:01.375
Okay.

25:01.758 --> 25:03.570
If you know Charlie so well.

25:04.765 --> 25:06.085
What's her best friend's name?

25:06.164 --> 25:08.498
Objection. Relevance?

25:08.733 --> 25:10.165
I'll allow it.

25:11.269 --> 25:13.312
Well, like all kids,

25:13.337 --> 25:14.430
I mean...

25:15.373 --> 25:16.705
it changes all the time.

25:16.908 --> 25:18.340
What about her favorite book...

25:18.342 --> 25:19.966
do you know the title, Mr. Kensington?

25:21.679 --> 25:22.839
Have you ever read it to her?

25:23.247 --> 25:25.126
No. No.

25:26.017 --> 25:28.484
And it's <i> The HalfBlood Prince.</i>

25:28.486 --> 25:30.286
No, I never have.

25:30.288 --> 25:31.666
And I don't know the book.

25:32.723 --> 25:34.756
The title, I mean. I'm sorry, honey.

25:34.859 --> 25:37.441
Any idea what Charlie
wants to be when she grows up?

25:37.466 --> 25:39.165
Your Honor. Overruled.

25:39.167 --> 25:40.614
I'm sure she's told me, but...

25:45.468 --> 25:47.403
I just can't remember.

25:47.405 --> 25:50.316
Concertmaster for the
Vienna Philharmonic, Your Honor.

25:50.741 --> 25:52.377
Just for the record.

25:53.077 --> 25:55.010
I knew he wouldn't remember that.

25:55.246 --> 25:57.354
The state is done
with this witness, Your Honor.

26:01.741 --> 26:03.896
I know this is not a very convenient time

26:03.921 --> 26:06.382
for this hearing,
with the holidays coming.

26:07.124 --> 26:09.510
But a child's wellbeing
is at stake here.

26:10.161 --> 26:12.496
And I implore you all to remember that.

26:13.931 --> 26:15.321
I'll see all parties back

26:15.346 --> 26:17.575
in this courtroom in two days
for further investigation.

26:18.002 --> 26:19.468
Until then, Charlotte is to remain

26:19.493 --> 26:21.170
under the exclusive care of her nanny,

26:21.172 --> 26:22.204
April Rockwell.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.039
And she is forbidden to return

26:24.064 --> 26:26.341
to the residence of her father,
Rex Kensington.

26:29.013 --> 26:32.244
Well, I, for one, feel like
we're off to a very good start.

26:32.670 --> 26:33.679
Charlie?

26:34.385 --> 26:35.972
Charlie? Charlie? Can we...

26:36.921 --> 26:39.790
can we just talk, please?

26:40.958 --> 26:41.877
No.

26:41.879 --> 26:43.998
I don't think we're supposed to do that.

26:44.795 --> 26:47.570
I think the judge said I wasn't
supposed to talk to you.

26:53.296 --> 26:55.783
The judge said you couldn't go home,

26:55.808 --> 26:57.873
not that you couldn't
talk to your father.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.876
Well, I don't think I should.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.458
I understand.

27:06.684 --> 27:09.446
But if you need me,
you have my cell phone.

27:09.471 --> 27:11.155
And wherever you are...

27:12.023 --> 27:13.163
I'll come to you.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.424
Just know that.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.061
Okay?

27:18.154 --> 27:19.413
Okay.

27:23.081 --> 27:24.081
Okay.

27:30.681 --> 27:32.580
You know, it is almost Christmas.

27:33.093 --> 27:34.577
What?

27:34.602 --> 27:36.309
You think Santa's gonna be mad at me

27:36.311 --> 27:38.047
'cause I wasn't nice to my dad?

27:38.249 --> 27:39.433
Just sayin'.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.280
Dominic Drake, the president

27:54.282 --> 27:56.039
of Hawker Cellular's on line three.

27:56.084 --> 27:57.451
Okay.

27:58.619 --> 28:00.697
Mr. Drake. Dr. Jason Bull.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.655
I think you know why I'm calling.

28:02.657 --> 28:05.635
I'm involved in litigation
on behalf of SAWAGI Cellular,

28:05.660 --> 28:08.037
and I'd love to convince you
to sign a letter

28:08.062 --> 28:09.462
that I've composed,

28:09.464 --> 28:12.056
acknowledging the layered and
evolutionary way that advances

28:12.100 --> 28:14.233
in technology happen in your industry.

28:16.237 --> 28:19.505
Boy, I could really use a cup of coffee.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.976
Yeah. Coffee sounds good.

28:24.212 --> 28:25.845
Maybe I'll join you.

28:25.847 --> 28:27.580
Um, the guy was thorough.

28:27.682 --> 28:28.948
Never let me take his picture.

28:28.950 --> 28:31.027
Said talking about his family
was too painful.

28:31.052 --> 28:33.494
Didn't introduce me
to a single one of his friends.

28:34.308 --> 28:35.599
And what about physical evidence?

28:35.623 --> 28:36.989
Combed every square inch of my apartment.

28:36.991 --> 28:39.502
He didn't leave behind
so much as a toothbrush.

28:40.636 --> 28:41.960
But he did drink my tequila.

28:42.846 --> 28:43.846
Men.

28:44.393 --> 28:46.394
Got a bottle for my birthday last year.

28:46.419 --> 28:48.559
Never opened it. Never even
took it out of the box.

28:48.636 --> 28:50.587
Then one night, Kyle took it out,

28:50.671 --> 28:52.405
drank right from the bottle.

28:52.407 --> 28:56.130
Which means his fingerprints
and his DNA are here somewhere.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.410
Men.

28:57.412 --> 28:59.808
Marissa! Cable! Danny! Anyone?

28:59.847 --> 29:02.449
Where is everybody?
It's not Christmas yet.

29:02.451 --> 29:04.738
We're here, Bull. We're here.

29:04.819 --> 29:07.530
Okay. I got three more CEOs to,

29:07.555 --> 29:10.183
say they'd sign a statement
acknowledging our thesis

29:10.236 --> 29:12.460
that many of the improvements
in cell phone technology

29:12.493 --> 29:14.370
are incremental and based
on shared knowledge.

29:14.395 --> 29:16.372
The good news is two of the three

29:16.397 --> 29:18.621
are here in New York.
The third one is in New Jersey.

29:18.623 --> 29:20.333
Hey. Benny and I are
heading out to court.

29:20.335 --> 29:22.879
Trial starts at 2:00. It's 1:15.

29:22.904 --> 29:25.037
Right behind you. I just
got to finish this one thing.

29:25.499 --> 29:26.939
I need these signatures today.

29:27.041 --> 29:29.803
And I need each of you to carry these,

29:29.805 --> 29:32.737
get them signed,
and then get them back to me.

29:32.981 --> 29:34.814
See you in court.

29:40.819 --> 29:41.759
Dr. Bull?

29:41.789 --> 29:43.522
April. Everything all right?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.658
I need to speak with you.

29:46.727 --> 29:47.860
Is it Charlie?

29:47.862 --> 29:49.306
Charlie's fine.

29:49.631 --> 29:51.792
Charlie's having the time
of her life, watching everyone

29:51.816 --> 29:53.966
twist themselves
into pretzels around her.

29:53.968 --> 29:56.026
She has no idea how serious this all is,

29:56.076 --> 29:58.839
and no idea
how much trouble she's causing.

30:04.685 --> 30:05.685
Okay.

30:05.945 --> 30:07.346
I'm sorry I said that.

30:08.183 --> 30:09.382
I care about Charlie.

30:09.384 --> 30:11.116
- I really do.
- But...

30:11.252 --> 30:14.469
But this is just a lot more allconsuming

30:14.494 --> 30:15.965
than I bargained for.

30:15.990 --> 30:18.068
I'm supposed to be finishing a thesis,

30:18.093 --> 30:19.959
not raising a little girl.

30:19.961 --> 30:22.138
After school and a couple
of nights a week...

30:22.163 --> 30:24.038
that's what I agreed to.

30:24.063 --> 30:25.499
But now Charlie's actually living with me

30:25.523 --> 30:28.244
in my studio apartment,
and I can't get anything done.

30:28.269 --> 30:30.580
It's the end of the term,
my paper is due tomorrow,

30:30.605 --> 30:32.538
and it's not going to be finished.

30:34.022 --> 30:35.462
I don't know how to say this, but...

30:35.915 --> 30:37.476
it's not what I signed up for.

30:38.471 --> 30:41.424
I'm sorry. II can't

30:41.449 --> 30:43.784
be Charlie's temporary guardian anymore.

30:44.152 --> 30:45.784
I just can't.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.519
- Not even one...
- No.

30:48.087 --> 30:49.365
Okay. Well...

30:49.848 --> 30:51.090
I'm sure we can
figure out another solution.

30:51.092 --> 30:52.925
I guess I'll just have to call the judge

30:52.961 --> 30:54.360
and come up with some next steps.

30:54.362 --> 30:56.195
But don't you worry about it.
You're right.

30:56.324 --> 30:58.130
This is not your responsibility.

30:58.132 --> 31:00.984
Your responsibility
is to get an education.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.669
Thank you.

31:03.671 --> 31:04.671
Not to worry.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.640
Good luck with your thesis.

31:07.642 --> 31:09.519
Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.

31:09.544 --> 31:11.522
- Happy Kwanzaa.
- Merry Christmas. You, too, Dr. Bull.

31:11.546 --> 31:13.012
Okay.

31:13.014 --> 31:14.413
I forgot.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.307
Charlie gets out of school at 3:15.

31:16.958 --> 31:17.958
Okay.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.113
Well, somebody has to pick her up.

31:24.939 --> 31:27.693
Marissa! Danny?

31:28.029 --> 31:29.261
Chunk?!

31:29.263 --> 31:30.396
Cable!

31:33.034 --> 31:34.900
Can I help you, Dr. Bull?

31:34.902 --> 31:38.371
I'm just looking
for someone I know and trust

31:38.396 --> 31:41.108
or, at the very least, whose name I know.

31:42.710 --> 31:45.354
I got to get to the courthouse
at 60 Center Street

31:45.379 --> 31:48.258
and the New Home Day School on East 62nd.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.326
Well, one is downtown
and the other's uptown.

31:50.351 --> 31:52.329
- Which one's first?
- Yeah, it's a quarter to 2:00.

31:52.353 --> 31:54.379
We're 20 minutes from court.
How long from,

31:54.422 --> 31:55.854
there to East 62nd?

31:55.923 --> 31:57.355
This time of day?

31:57.425 --> 32:00.043
35 minutes, easy. We'll just make it.

32:00.076 --> 32:01.131
Let's go to court.

32:03.628 --> 32:06.565
Hey, Bull. Good to hear from you.

32:06.567 --> 32:09.896
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all
just, waiting to get in.

32:10.138 --> 32:14.072
And by the way,
people keep asking where you are

32:14.142 --> 32:16.008
and making ugly faces
when I say, "He's on his way."

32:16.010 --> 32:18.554
He is. And I got written
statements from major CEOs

32:18.579 --> 32:20.523
to back up our thesis on the way, too.

32:20.548 --> 32:21.780
Here's the thing:

32:21.883 --> 32:24.360
Second I get there,
I need Chunk to jump in the cab

32:24.385 --> 32:26.162
and go pick up Charlie at school.

32:26.187 --> 32:27.720
Excuse me? Whatwhat...

32:27.722 --> 32:30.021
Who is this Charlie guy?
What are you talking about?

32:30.091 --> 32:32.655
Never mind.
I'll text you when I get close.

32:32.927 --> 32:35.479
<i>We haven't moved in, like, five minutes.</i>

32:35.530 --> 32:37.229
It's Christmas in New York.

32:37.231 --> 32:38.290
You know what?

32:38.733 --> 32:40.830
Here. Never mind.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.294
Keep the change.

32:47.085 --> 32:48.417
Hello?

32:48.442 --> 32:50.542
We have got a problem.

32:50.645 --> 32:52.188
We just started voir dire

32:52.213 --> 32:53.899
and the clients are having a stroke.

32:53.924 --> 32:55.281
They want <i> you</i> here.

32:55.283 --> 32:57.752
And Benny's been stalling like
a car with a bad carburetor.

32:57.785 --> 33:00.229
Chunk, tell him I'm getting
there as fast as I can.

33:00.254 --> 33:02.064
What's that?

33:02.089 --> 33:04.390
Those bells.

33:04.392 --> 33:07.283
Church bells? It's 3:00.

33:07.328 --> 33:09.305
Okay. Tell Benny he's gonna
have to do his best.

33:09.330 --> 33:11.599
I'm not gonna make it. I got
to be uptown in 15 minutes.

33:11.632 --> 33:13.009
What are you talking about?

33:13.034 --> 33:14.034
I'll explain later.

33:33.649 --> 33:34.882
Rex?!

33:36.090 --> 33:37.090
Charlie?

33:39.291 --> 33:40.453
Charlie?

33:41.504 --> 33:43.036
Rex?

33:43.659 --> 33:45.492
My.

33:45.554 --> 33:47.717
- Dr. Bull?
- Rex.

33:49.731 --> 33:51.164
What are you doing here?

33:51.166 --> 33:52.064
He saved me.

33:52.089 --> 33:53.657
Well, Charlie called me.

33:53.784 --> 33:56.670
II guess the nanny just flaked out,

33:56.672 --> 33:58.750
didn't pick her up
from school, so, I mean,

33:58.775 --> 34:01.209
I called her, butbut I think
she just turned her cell off.

34:01.310 --> 34:04.088
Charlie was terrified,
so I just ran right over.

34:05.026 --> 34:06.339
So where are you going now?

34:06.364 --> 34:08.348
I don't... I don't know. I mean, I'm...

34:08.491 --> 34:11.164
I'm not allowed to bring her
back to the apartment, so...

34:11.620 --> 34:14.353
This is a little ridiculous, isn't it?

34:14.489 --> 34:17.224
You want to be with
your daddy, don't you?

34:19.393 --> 34:21.138
And I know you want
your little girl back.

34:21.163 --> 34:22.529
I do.

34:22.531 --> 34:23.909
So let's end this.

34:24.433 --> 34:26.887
The judge wants to hear
from you, Charlie.

34:27.268 --> 34:28.913
You can put an end to this whole thing.

34:29.905 --> 34:31.138
I know.

34:31.306 --> 34:33.072
So let's grab a cab and go see him.

34:33.074 --> 34:34.407
What do you say?

34:39.034 --> 34:40.746
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

34:41.703 --> 34:44.228
Bull here yet? I got
that signed letter for him.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.263
No. Apparently, we all beat him here.

34:46.288 --> 34:48.188
The word is he's on his way.

34:48.190 --> 34:51.454
We actually do
have some news, though.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.772
My friend at the NYPD...
he got a hit on Kyle's prints.

34:55.797 --> 34:58.650
- Seriously?
- Yup. So, Kyle Anderson

34:58.734 --> 35:00.582
is actually Robert Allen.

35:00.836 --> 35:03.006
Turns out he's got a wife and three kids.

35:03.171 --> 35:05.331
They live just outside
of Bedford, New York,

35:05.356 --> 35:07.215
though the fam claims
they haven't seen him in years.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.720
Nonetheless, wifey somehow
affords a big house

35:09.745 --> 35:11.378
and private schools for the kids.

35:13.631 --> 35:14.947
You okay?

35:16.497 --> 35:17.984
How did I not know?

35:17.986 --> 35:18.992
The guy is good.

35:18.994 --> 35:22.649
Also, he has outstanding
warrants for tax evasion,

35:23.038 --> 35:25.326
international money laundering, larceny.

35:26.161 --> 35:27.161
It's quite a list.

35:27.645 --> 35:29.373
Which is probably why he needed you

35:29.398 --> 35:30.997
to get him a passport,
'cause there was no way

35:30.999 --> 35:32.377
he was getting out
of the country with his own.

35:32.401 --> 35:34.634
I used the number
of the passport you got him

35:34.636 --> 35:36.301
to trace him to a resort on Virgin Gorda.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.160
He's been there for the past three weeks

35:38.206 --> 35:39.621
opening up bank accounts.

35:40.875 --> 35:42.825
The British Virgin Islands. Of course.

35:43.112 --> 35:45.045
He's there laundering money.

35:45.047 --> 35:47.555
Looks like he deposited
over half a million dollars.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.383
He was a busy boy.

35:53.858 --> 35:54.888
Church bells.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.839
Always makes me think of Christmas.

35:56.892 --> 35:58.726
Christmas.

35:59.094 --> 36:01.743
I wonder if Kyle's coming home.

36:04.219 --> 36:06.086
Well, you said he had a wife and kids.

36:06.648 --> 36:08.201
What are you thinking?

36:08.203 --> 36:10.301
I'm thinking,
how many flights can there be

36:10.339 --> 36:11.921
from the Virgin Islands to New York

36:11.946 --> 36:13.393
between now and Christmas?

36:13.418 --> 36:14.384
Give that to Bull.

36:14.409 --> 36:16.619
I got some lastminute
Christmas plans I got to make.

36:17.489 --> 36:20.223
<i>Judge said he'd be there till 4:30.</i>

36:20.248 --> 36:22.181
We should just make it.

36:24.653 --> 36:26.597
Charlie? You okay, honey?

36:26.622 --> 36:28.436
You worried about talking to the judge?

36:31.293 --> 36:33.236
I was thinking about mom

36:34.401 --> 36:37.266
and how she'd tell me stories
about Santa Claus.

36:40.435 --> 36:42.135
And how we'd track

36:42.160 --> 36:45.305
what part of the world
he was in on her computer.

36:47.062 --> 36:48.572
You know, we could do that.

36:49.611 --> 36:50.713
You and I could do that.

36:51.613 --> 36:53.488
No. It's okay.

36:53.615 --> 36:55.368
I know it's a fairy tale.

36:55.584 --> 36:57.787
I've known for a while now. I'm nine.

36:57.919 --> 37:00.986
Is that true? Really? A fairy tale?

37:01.716 --> 37:03.736
I'm... I'm not sure I believe that.

37:03.761 --> 37:05.294
Yeah. I mean,

37:05.894 --> 37:07.294
me, either.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.948
I'm sorry I was mean to you, Dad.

37:10.553 --> 37:12.814
I just missed Mommy.

37:12.834 --> 37:17.026
I'm sorry that I wasn't
a better dad, darling.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.209
I really miss her, too.

37:27.449 --> 37:29.616
Well, here we are.

37:30.986 --> 37:32.819
All right.

37:38.714 --> 37:39.847
Hey!

37:39.872 --> 37:41.706
Where the hell have you been?!

37:42.397 --> 37:44.953
We just lost a key juror
in there, and you were MIA.

37:44.978 --> 37:47.473
Mr. Holt, there's a child.

37:49.471 --> 37:50.804
I apologize.

37:50.806 --> 37:52.986
I was unforeseeably
detained. Nonetheless,

37:53.011 --> 37:54.674
you're in great hands.

37:54.676 --> 37:56.009
Look, Mr. Colรณn and Mr...

37:56.034 --> 37:57.977
I'm sure they're great;
Those are not the hands

37:58.013 --> 37:59.979
I'm paying for.

38:00.607 --> 38:01.659
Okay, we're getting called back in.

38:01.683 --> 38:03.016
I need you to roll up your sleeves,

38:03.040 --> 38:04.606
get your head in the game.

38:06.861 --> 38:08.294
It's 4:20, Dr. Bull.

38:14.096 --> 38:16.361
I have a previous commitment.

38:19.568 --> 38:21.167
Go to the judge's office.

38:21.169 --> 38:23.092
I will be right behind
you guys, all right?

38:25.607 --> 38:27.205
Let me be clear.

38:28.206 --> 38:30.656
If I walk into that courtroom
without you,

38:30.912 --> 38:32.776
you and your people are off the case.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.648
Then so be it.

38:36.417 --> 38:38.929
Truthfully, it was a mistake
to get involved to begin with.

38:38.954 --> 38:40.708
I mean, it's Christmas.

38:42.190 --> 38:44.185
I guess I just let greed

38:44.210 --> 38:47.008
and my own ego get the best of me.

38:47.062 --> 38:49.062
I do apologize.

38:50.832 --> 38:52.684
And to you guys, too. I...

38:55.637 --> 38:57.370
I don't know what I was thinking.

38:59.508 --> 39:01.104
But I do have a gift for you.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.657
You guys have those envelopes?

39:04.412 --> 39:06.980
Share these with your attorneys.

39:06.982 --> 39:09.551
I think it'll go a long way
to getting you what you want.

39:15.390 --> 39:16.713
You're very welcome!

39:17.526 --> 39:19.703
That guy's getting a lot of coal
this Christmas.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.329
Why do you guys put up with me?

39:23.465 --> 39:25.298
All right, go to your meeting.

39:28.053 --> 39:29.236
Merry Christmas.

39:30.472 --> 39:31.604
Bring it in.

39:34.186 --> 39:36.620
All right, go do some shopping.

39:36.645 --> 39:39.108
Do some drinking, get silly.

39:39.347 --> 39:43.034
And I don't want to see any of
you until after the new year.

39:43.986 --> 39:44.986
Bye.

39:46.655 --> 39:49.118
Where's Marissa?

39:49.143 --> 39:50.957
I have no idea.

39:50.959 --> 39:52.792
But I'm sure she'll check in
by the holiday.

39:53.795 --> 39:55.795
You doing anything for Christmas, boss?

39:55.863 --> 39:57.397
Not gonna be alone, are you?

39:57.399 --> 39:59.232
I got big plans.

40:00.234 --> 40:01.668
Merry Christmas, Benny.

40:01.670 --> 40:03.067
Merry Christmas.

40:34.135 --> 40:34.266
Merry Christmas, Kyle.

40:34.268 --> 40:36.236
Merry Christmas, Kyle.

40:36.238 --> 40:39.053
FBI! Robert Allen, you're
under arrest for fraud,

40:39.140 --> 40:41.368
larceny, money laundering
and tax evasion.

40:41.393 --> 40:44.398
Place your hands on top of your
head and get down on your knees.

40:46.982 --> 40:48.307
Have a fabulous New Year's, too.

40:53.188 --> 40:56.756
He just left Providence,
and he is on his way here.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.691
- Dad.
- Look, I believe.

40:59.694 --> 41:01.027
Once you fall asleep,

41:01.029 --> 41:03.062
I know he's gonna come down that chimney.

41:03.064 --> 41:04.721
We don't have any chimneys.

41:04.933 --> 41:07.533
We don't have any fireplaces.

41:07.669 --> 41:10.336
You may be on to something there.

41:13.394 --> 41:15.485
Someone's coming up our elevator.

41:15.510 --> 41:16.643
I wonder who that could be.

41:17.312 --> 41:20.439
Dad, don't open it!
The doorman didn't call

41:20.482 --> 41:22.615
- and ask to buzz him up.
- Well, I'm not just gonna

41:22.640 --> 41:25.128
leave somebody trapped in the elevator.

41:32.427 --> 41:34.608
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

41:34.961 --> 41:39.063
I've got some presents here
for little Charlie Kensington.

41:39.567 --> 41:42.946
Hopefully, she's asleep.

41:43.505 --> 41:45.338
It's really you!

41:48.610 --> 41:51.970
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Someone's excited.

41:52.547 --> 41:55.582
I know it's you,
Dr. Bull, but don't say anything.

41:55.736 --> 41:57.965
My dad still believes in all this stuff.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.413
Okay.

42:00.555 --> 42:03.323
And thank you
for bringing him back to me.

42:03.325 --> 42:05.258
This is the best Christmas ever.

42:09.934 --> 42:11.331
Well, I'm not allowed

42:11.333 --> 42:14.824
to give out any presents
until everyone is asleep,

42:15.511 --> 42:16.617
So.

42:17.305 --> 42:20.605
I'll have to stop back by a little later.

42:38.126 --> 42:40.293
And to all a good night.

43:08.189 --> 43:09.521
Nice look.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.179
Back at ya.
