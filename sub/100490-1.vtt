04:07.458 --> 04:09.708
<i>Some real things</i>
<i>have happened lately.</i>

04:11.208 --> 04:13.958
<i>-First, I wanted to know who.</i>

04:15.125 --> 04:17.166
<i>Who chose money over life?</i>

04:18.083 --> 04:20.375
<i>Steel and lead over blood and spirit?</i>

04:23.833 --> 04:25.458
<i>Who was it overlooked...</i>

04:26.083 --> 04:27.041
<i>the living?</i>

04:28.750 --> 04:30.958
<i>Who let distance and basic difference</i>

04:31.041 --> 04:33.458
<i>decide whose man</i>
<i>was left behind bleeding out,</i>

04:34.208 --> 04:36.000
<i>and whose men medevac'd to safety?</i>

04:37.291 --> 04:38.541
<i>Who the war pig?</i>

04:39.125 --> 04:40.500
<i>Who the profiteer?</i>

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
-<i>Who the cold heart?</i>

04:43.083 --> 04:44.791
<i>The vapid soul?</i>

04:45.583 --> 04:46.500
<i>And second...</i>

04:47.416 --> 04:50.333
<i>Second, I wanted to know why.</i>

04:53.958 --> 04:56.250
<i>For a while, we thought time was money.</i>

04:56.666 --> 04:58.666
<i>Find the time, the money comes with it.</i>

04:59.916 --> 05:01.083
<i>Moving fast.</i>

05:01.166 --> 05:03.916
<i>Get the big suite,</i>
<i>the multi-line telephones.</i>

05:04.375 --> 05:07.666
<i>Get room service on one, get valet on two,</i>
<i>premium service,</i>

05:07.750 --> 05:09.500
<i>out by nine, back by one.</i>

05:10.333 --> 05:11.750
<i>Download all data.</i>

05:11.833 --> 05:14.666
<i>Uplink Prague,</i>
<i>get some conference calls going.</i>

05:14.750 --> 05:18.750
<i>Sell AlliedSignal, buy Cyprus Minerals,</i>
<i>work the management plays.</i>

05:18.833 --> 05:20.291
<i>Plug into the news cycle,</i>

05:20.375 --> 05:21.666
<i>get the wires raw,</i>

05:21.750 --> 05:23.291
<i>nod out on the noise.</i>

05:24.958 --> 05:27.875
<i>Somewhere in the nod,</i>
<i>we were dropping cargo.</i>

05:28.666 --> 05:32.000
<i>Somewhere in the nod,</i>
<i>we were losing infrastructure,</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:34.416
<i>losing redundant systems,</i>

05:34.916 --> 05:37.208
<i>losing specific gravity.</i>

05:38.208 --> 05:40.750
<i>Weightlessness seemed, at the time,</i>
<i>the safer mode.</i>

05:42.208 --> 05:43.666
<i>Weightlessness seemed, at the time,</i>

05:43.750 --> 05:47.666
<i>the mode in which we could beat</i>
<i>both the clock and the affect itself.</i>

05:48.666 --> 05:49.500
<i>But...</i>

05:50.916 --> 05:52.416
<i>I see now that it was not.</i>

05:53.541 --> 05:55.500
<i>I see now that the clock was ticking.</i>

05:56.708 --> 05:59.708
<i>I see now that we were experiencing</i>
<i>not weightlessness,</i>

05:59.791 --> 06:01.541
<i>but what is interestingly described</i>

06:01.625 --> 06:04.833
<i>on page 1513 of the </i>Merck Manual,
<i>15th edition,</i>

06:04.916 --> 06:08.291
<i>as a sustained reactive depression,</i>

06:09.541 --> 06:11.250
<i>a bereavement reaction...</i>

06:11.958 --> 06:14.875
<i>to the leaving of familiar environments.</i>

06:15.916 --> 06:17.083
<i>I see now...</i>

06:18.666 --> 06:20.791
<i>that the environment we were leaving...</i>

06:22.000 --> 06:23.208
<i>was that of feeling rich.</i>

06:24.291 --> 06:25.958
<i>I did not see it then.</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:49.166
<i>This should have alerted us.</i>

06:50.416 --> 06:51.833
<i>Should have been processed.</i>

06:58.583 --> 07:00.333
<i>There were hints all along,</i>

07:00.416 --> 07:03.375
<i>clues we should have registered,</i>
<i>processed,</i>

07:03.458 --> 07:05.875
<i>sifted for their application</i>
<i>to the general condition.</i>

07:09.500 --> 07:11.791
<i>But we were moving fast.</i>

07:14.416 --> 07:15.958
<i>We were traveling light.</i>

07:18.583 --> 07:19.625
<i>We were younger.</i>

07:33.833 --> 07:34.875
<i>I was younger.</i>

07:58.416 --> 08:00.833
<i>Well, I'd hate to speak</i>
<i>about that, but of course, uh,</i>

08:00.916 --> 08:02.791
<i>we'll look into it. Um...</i>

08:02.875 --> 08:06.000
But the actions that we have been forced
to take in that area,

08:06.250 --> 08:07.750
obviously, have been justified.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.708
Japanese government vis-à-vis trade
is complicated,

08:10.791 --> 08:12.291
but the simple answer is,

08:12.708 --> 08:17.583
we're hoping that with the shift
from a distinctly liberal apparatus

08:17.666 --> 08:18.791
to a conservative one,

08:19.375 --> 08:22.166
Japan will shift away
from its nationalistic tendencies...

08:22.250 --> 08:23.625
-Hi.
-...to a system more in tune

08:23.708 --> 08:26.000
with free trade to North America.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.500
Not just us,

08:27.875 --> 08:29.416
but Canada included.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.125
-What did I miss?
- One more question.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.500
So far, nothing.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.458
Why am I not surprised?

08:35.375 --> 08:37.833
Apparently,
spring is a great time

08:37.916 --> 08:39.750
to talk to Japan face-to-face.

08:39.833 --> 08:42.416
- Oh.
-Cherry blossoms, temples at Mount Fuji.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.625
I believe it's called
international diplomacy.

08:44.708 --> 08:47.625
...my sense is that
that is the direction we're headed.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.791
I believe we have time
for one more question.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.166
Okay, <i>The Atlantic Post.</i>

08:54.250 --> 08:56.416
Yes, thank you. Elena McMahon. Uh...

08:56.500 --> 08:58.750
Mr. Secretary,
with regards to the Pacific Rim,

08:58.833 --> 09:01.166
where, as you put it,
"We've lost so much ground,"

09:01.250 --> 09:02.583
how might you address reports

09:02.666 --> 09:06.000
the CIA is laying underwater mines
in Nicaraguan ports?

09:07.083 --> 09:09.708
Does Washington have any control
over mining operations in Nicaragua?

09:09.791 --> 09:11.458
I don't have any comment to make.

09:11.541 --> 09:14.125
No? Care to comment on what
the purpose of the harbor mining is?

09:14.208 --> 09:15.291
Doesn't turning a blind eye

09:15.375 --> 09:17.916
to the blocking of major shipping channels
seem counterintuitive

09:18.000 --> 09:20.583
for an administration
interested in improving trade?

09:20.666 --> 09:23.000
You'd have to ask the Contras about that.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.875
Uh, sir, with all due respect,

09:24.958 --> 09:28.541
the President has said on television,
and I quote,

09:28.625 --> 09:30.125
"I, too, am a Contra."

09:32.708 --> 09:34.375
-Look, uh...

09:34.458 --> 09:37.000
It looks like their purpose may indeed be

09:37.083 --> 09:39.500
to somehow interrupt the commerce
of the country.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.625
And is this at the bequest of Washington?

09:42.125 --> 09:44.625
Again, there's no answer
I can provide there.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.666
Ladies and gentlemen,
we need to be mindful of our time.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.583
So, Mr. Secretary, thank you so much
for being here today.

09:50.666 --> 09:53.458
Thank you so much for your time
spent during lunch.

09:53.541 --> 09:56.333
Uh, from the Press Club, we'd like
to thank everybody for your questions.

09:56.416 --> 09:57.708
Shultzy and the rope-a-dope.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.458
Saved by the bell, I think.

09:59.541 --> 10:02.208
Our special guest will be
United Nations Secretary General

10:02.291 --> 10:03.625
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.250
Thank you very much for attending.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.541
Not with a ten-foot pole, Treat.
The hell I will.

10:08.625 --> 10:10.458
Understood, George,
but we need a narrative.

10:10.541 --> 10:11.375
A story?

10:11.458 --> 10:13.750
Treat, you and I both know
what's going on down there.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.333
It's just another manipulation

10:15.416 --> 10:17.750
they expect me to wrestle with
on their behalf.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.750
Nicaragua is a cancer
in our own land mass,

10:21.833 --> 10:23.666
and it's gotta be cut out,
plain and simple.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.333
The tide will ebb away from us.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.375
Meanwhile, if a little intel leaks
here and there,

10:27.458 --> 10:30.083
as long as it helps push the notion
that we're a stabilizing factor

10:30.166 --> 10:31.791
in the zone, it's a positive.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.416
Important thing is to control it,
keep it headed in that direction.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.958
This whole goddamn operation's
gonna blow up in somebody's face,

10:37.041 --> 10:39.458
and I will not let it be mine,
not by a long shot.

10:39.541 --> 10:40.708
You boys figure it.

10:42.416 --> 10:44.375
<i>Don't think your vote</i>
<i>isn't needed.</i>

10:44.458 --> 10:45.708
<i>Go and vote!</i>

10:46.250 --> 10:47.625
<i>And take others with you...</i>

10:47.708 --> 10:49.875
- Hi, kiddo.
- <i>Hi.</i>

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
<i>How was the funeral?</i>

10:52.708 --> 10:54.958
Well, it wasn't exactly a funeral.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.041
I just went to Grandpa Ward's house

10:57.125 --> 11:00.250
and he showed me a tiny urn
with some of Grandma's ashes in it.

11:01.416 --> 11:02.625
<i>Were you sad?</i>

11:07.875 --> 11:10.083
I was. I was something like sad.

11:11.583 --> 11:15.000
Why not sad? Why just something like it?

11:16.041 --> 11:18.041
Well, I thought a lot about you.

11:18.708 --> 11:20.375
And that helped keep me thankful.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.541
- <i>Really?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.083
Like, how?

11:24.458 --> 11:26.666
Like how you look so much
like your grandmother.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.500
Your smile, your eyes.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.375
<i>And that helped keep me happy.</i>

11:33.708 --> 11:34.875
Wish I could have gone.

11:35.791 --> 11:36.791
You do?

11:36.875 --> 11:37.750
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:39.750 --> 11:41.166
What are you doing right now?

11:41.916 --> 11:44.041
<i>I really want some lechón from Versailles.</i>

11:44.333 --> 11:47.458
Oh, baby, me too. Me too.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.333
But I'll tell you what.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.083
I'll get you real lechón from Havana

11:52.166 --> 11:54.375
just as soon
as there's a bureau spot for me.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.125
-Okay. I should.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.958
-McMahon.
-I'm gonna have it filed in an hour.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.666
McMahon, here, now.
Come here, come here. In, in, in, in.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.916
Uh, listen. Close the door. Sit down.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.916
Okay, um, how did everything go
with your mom? You doing okay?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.583
-Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. What's up?
-Good.

12:11.666 --> 12:14.833
That move to reopen Central American
bureau, it's just not happening.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.333
Says who?

12:17.791 --> 12:19.541
-Please. No, don't--
-Stewart, what the hell?

12:19.625 --> 12:21.833
I've been trying to convince you,
Grant, everybody,

12:21.916 --> 12:24.208
since we left San Salvador two years ago.

12:24.291 --> 12:27.416
We ID'd those bullet casings to Missouri,
we have tracked airstrips, munitions.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.708
Just this morning I was in touch
with my Hill source who--

12:29.791 --> 12:32.041
-Who hasn't stepped forward.
-Who's about to step forward.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.791
-Oh, come on.
-He's legit. He's reliable.

12:33.875 --> 12:37.208
I just confronted Shultz over the mined
harbors and he nearly shit his pants.

12:37.291 --> 12:40.416
If am doing this stuff from here, imagine
what I could do on the ground there.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.291
-I gotta move you to the campaign trail.
- No!

12:43.708 --> 12:44.916
No, there's an entire room.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.750
-What about Joanne?
- Sprained ankle.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.208
-What about Chris?
- He's filling in for Joanne.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.916
Well, I don't care. Put a stringer on it.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.666
You can't wipe me from this, Stewart.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.916
I gotta freeze the whole desk,
not just you.

12:55.875 --> 12:56.875
Freeze the desk?

12:56.958 --> 12:58.458
Look, our reporting on Central America

12:58.541 --> 13:01.041
is being pointed out
as too soft, sympathetic.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.291
Says who?

13:05.458 --> 13:07.416
Off the record,
Grant was here this morning.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.750
People on the Hill are pressing.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.916
Of course they are, Stewart.
They're being exposed.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.250
That's the whole point, right?

13:12.333 --> 13:15.416
Be that as it may, they're the ones
who can break the bottom line here.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.666
You know how it goes.
Grant moves with business people,

13:18.750 --> 13:19.958
politicians, lobbyists.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.083
He's not gonna cut those ties
for your reporting.

13:22.625 --> 13:23.833
Sometimes...

13:23.916 --> 13:25.625
it's just business.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.500
It's not just business,
it's real people's lives down there.

13:30.583 --> 13:31.833
You can't just look away.

13:39.791 --> 13:41.791
It's been ringing ever since I got back.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.583
-I take it you talked to Stewart?
- I'm done.

13:45.666 --> 13:46.625
You quit, right?

13:48.125 --> 13:49.333
Tell me you walked.

13:49.416 --> 13:50.875
I'm taking a vacation.

13:50.958 --> 13:54.083
Oh, Jesus Christ, Alma,
he froze the desk, for fuck's sake.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.083
Do you know how many months
I've accrued over the past three years?

13:57.166 --> 13:58.083
It's appalling.

13:58.666 --> 13:59.916
-Come on.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.416
You seriously think
that I'm gonna stop working?

14:02.500 --> 14:04.583
All of this keeps moving. We keep moving.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.291
The only difference is, is that we won't
have to file for a couple of months.

14:08.958 --> 14:09.791
Think about it.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.958
The campaign trail drops you
that much closer to the center.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.708
On and off the plane,
in and out of certain rooms.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.208
McMahon.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.208
-Hello.

14:25.291 --> 14:29.000
<i>Pardon my using your time,</i>
<i>but I've been trying to call your mother,</i>

14:29.083 --> 14:32.125
<i>and that asshole she lives with</i>
<i>refuses to put her on the line.</i>

14:32.208 --> 14:34.375
That's because he can't, Dad. Remember?

14:34.458 --> 14:37.708
<i>I'm passing through. Maybe</i>
<i>you could meet me in the next half hour.</i>

14:37.791 --> 14:39.625
-I am at work.

14:39.708 --> 14:42.291
<i>Some kind of coincidence,</i>
<i>since that's where I called you.</i>

14:42.375 --> 14:44.083
Look, Dad, I'm on a deadline here.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.666
<i>I can do 5:30.</i>

14:46.125 --> 14:47.291
<i>Meet me at the Madison.</i>

14:47.583 --> 14:48.750
No, Dad, I--

14:55.041 --> 14:56.625
Policy-wise, it's a disaster.

14:56.708 --> 14:57.916
It's not "policy,"

14:58.000 --> 14:59.750
-it's politesse.
-Keep on shoveling it.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.416
-Spit it out, buddy, what's your problem?
- Dad.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.625
We have no problem.

15:06.125 --> 15:06.958
Dad.

15:07.625 --> 15:08.666
Faggots.

15:08.750 --> 15:09.916
Actually, you're wrong.

15:10.416 --> 15:11.625
I can see...

15:12.166 --> 15:14.291
you're buying into the whole package here.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.875
You're very adaptable,
I ever tell you that?

15:16.958 --> 15:18.083
Just like your mother.

15:18.791 --> 15:20.041
Oh, come on, Ellie.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.000
Celebrate with me.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.375
This is your celebratory mode?

15:23.458 --> 15:27.666
Come on, I...
I got a big deal coming. <i>The</i> big deal.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.208
If this goes off, finally I'll be able
to leave you something.

15:31.666 --> 15:33.708
Hey, buddy.
What do you want?

15:34.541 --> 15:36.375
-Oh, vodka tonic, please.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.250
Say "Absolut."

15:38.333 --> 15:39.875
In these sissy bars, you say "vodka,"

15:39.958 --> 15:43.458
and they'll give you a Schmerk-off
or whatever it's called and charge extra.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.166
Early Times and water for me. And...

15:45.250 --> 15:47.583
break out the almonds, pal.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.291
Leave the cereal for the queers.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.250
So, you do this every day?

15:53.333 --> 15:56.166
Same lying sacks of suit-and-tie shits

15:56.250 --> 15:58.833
blowing hot air up each other's assholes,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.083
and you got to sit there and take notes.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.291
Don't know how you manage, Ellie.

16:05.083 --> 16:08.333
Well, that must have been something
you lost out on observing once you left.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.583
-That's not fair.
- No.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Let me fill you in.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.666
How do I manage? Let's see.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.541
Um... well, first I managed
to graduate high school

16:15.625 --> 16:18.291
after you walked out on Mom,
uh, 20 years ago.

16:18.750 --> 16:22.416
Then I managed to stay at UNLV
as long as I could afford it,

16:22.500 --> 16:25.708
seeing as how my long-lost father wouldn't
tell me what to list as his profession

16:25.791 --> 16:27.541
on the financial aid application.

16:27.625 --> 16:30.250
What was it you told me
when I finally tracked you down?

16:30.666 --> 16:31.791
"Import-export"?

16:32.166 --> 16:34.083
No, no, no. "Supply chain."

16:34.458 --> 16:37.208
Let's see, what else, uh... Oh, oh!
I managed to have a kid of my own,

16:37.291 --> 16:40.375
and I still know her, too,
so that's an achievement.

16:40.791 --> 16:41.625
Um...

16:41.916 --> 16:42.833
Breast cancer.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.875
Managed to get through that.

16:46.375 --> 16:47.791
So, uh, anything else...

16:47.875 --> 16:49.375
Oh, yeah. Career,

16:49.458 --> 16:51.791
divorce, cross-country relocation.

16:51.875 --> 16:55.458
All in all,
I'd say I've managed pretty well.

16:55.541 --> 16:59.416
So, the fucking Phi Pho Epsilons
over at table 22

16:59.500 --> 17:01.208
don't really bleep on my radar
at this point.

17:01.666 --> 17:03.833
I got other shit I'm managing.
Thanks, Dick.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.083
About time, sweetheart.

17:08.416 --> 17:10.458
Here's to your success.

17:10.916 --> 17:12.250
-My Ellie.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.041
And cheers to big moves.

17:17.541 --> 17:20.708
In fact, you just missed my partner.
You know him, Epperson.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.125
I don't know him.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.416
Yeah, you do. You remember.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.875
Maxie. Anyway,

17:24.958 --> 17:27.125
I'm moving product at triple my rate.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.250
-Dare I ask what the product is?
-Same as it ever was.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.958
You haven't changed, have you?

17:32.291 --> 17:34.916
Anyhow, how's my little Cathy-bird?

17:37.916 --> 17:39.750
She's fine. She's good, Dad.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.000
You still got that poor little thing
locked away up north?

17:43.083 --> 17:47.083
It's a boarding school with horse stables
and a Greek amphitheater.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.166
Don't be extreme.

17:48.666 --> 17:51.750
Anyway, with my schedule, boarding
school's the most consistent option.

17:52.625 --> 17:53.875
Have you heard from your mother?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.625
You know, I keep calling the house,

17:56.708 --> 18:00.458
and that drug-dealer boyfriend of hers
doesn't let me talk to her. Asshole.

18:00.958 --> 18:03.750
I say, "Let me talk to Kitty already."
"You can't," he says.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.958
I go, "Put her
on the goddamn line, prick."

18:06.041 --> 18:07.833
-And you know what that bum does?
-Dad.

18:07.916 --> 18:08.750
He hangs up on me.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.458
-Dad.
-Believe it? He hangs right up. What?

18:10.541 --> 18:14.208
You don't remember I called you last month
to say I was going to California?

18:14.291 --> 18:17.416
No, What?
To visit your trust-fund husband?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.708
Ex-husband, and...

18:19.458 --> 18:20.291
no.

18:20.375 --> 18:23.625
You don't remember I-I called to tell you
I was going to the funeral?

18:24.083 --> 18:24.916
We talked about it.

18:25.958 --> 18:26.916
Someone died?

18:27.916 --> 18:28.750
Who died?

18:37.875 --> 18:39.250
When I first saw her, I...

18:40.791 --> 18:42.833
I'll never forget it.

18:42.916 --> 18:45.041
She-- Like a ray of light.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.250
The Floridita in Havana, 1952.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.041
Goddamn, we had a good time there.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.916
My Catherine. Pretty Kitty.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.208
Kit-Cat.

18:55.416 --> 18:56.583
Mom used to always talk about

18:56.666 --> 18:59.250
how you guys would get the garlic shrimp
with black beans every day.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.875
That's right. Uh...

19:00.958 --> 19:04.125
Before the revolution,
when Havana was a real town.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.750
Goddamn.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.000
Kitty's gone.

19:13.291 --> 19:14.125
Whoop!

19:15.833 --> 19:17.666
Things are hotting up again.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.541
Whole lot of poppin' going on.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.416
Oh, come on, Ellie.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.083
Give us a smile.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.041
Come on.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.000
Another. Another round.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.458
I'm good.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.000
<i>♪ Gotta get away ♪</i>

19:42.791 --> 19:44.583

19:44.666 --> 19:46.333
No, I was the top of my class.

19:46.416 --> 19:47.833
Hey. Hey, you can sit here.

19:49.291 --> 19:52.125
I'm all about that.
Hey, Pete, get the tunes going!

19:52.916 --> 19:53.833
Yeah!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.708
A little mealy. From yesterday.

19:56.791 --> 20:01.041
- Oh! Jensen, you pig.
-Yeah, that was me. That was me!

20:01.125 --> 20:01.958
Yeah!

20:05.375 --> 20:07.000

Four more years!

20:18.416 --> 20:20.000
Four more years!

20:20.083 --> 20:21.583
Four more years!

20:23.333 --> 20:26.000
That's what I came here
to talk to you about.

20:26.625 --> 20:27.958
We love you, Ronnie!

20:28.416 --> 20:32.083
Abe Lincoln said that we must
disenthrall ourselves with the past,

20:32.166 --> 20:33.916
and then we will save our country.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.083
Four years ago, that's what we did.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.625
We made a great turn.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.583
Thank you. Thank you, all.

20:51.083 --> 20:55.250
With regard to the future,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.416
Thank you. Thank you.

21:09.166 --> 21:10.916
Does everyone have a glass?

21:11.750 --> 21:13.625
Happy birthday, Helena.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.666
But you all should know
that this brave and regal lady

21:19.750 --> 21:22.666
is distinguished by a history of service

21:22.750 --> 21:24.791
to her community and her country.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.500
It comes as no surprise

21:26.583 --> 21:29.208
that she would share her own birthday
to be with us

21:29.291 --> 21:31.583
for a fundraiser for Team Reagan.

21:34.208 --> 21:38.041
So, Helena, here's to many years
of selfless service,

21:38.583 --> 21:42.625
and here's to four more years
of Reagan country!

21:47.291 --> 21:48.166
George.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.250
Oh, George, this...

21:50.666 --> 21:52.750
This is the young lady
that I wanted you to meet.

21:53.916 --> 21:55.458
Her name's just like mine.

21:55.541 --> 21:56.791
-Elena.
-Helena.

21:56.875 --> 21:57.875
Helena.

22:00.041 --> 22:01.000
She works for--

22:01.083 --> 22:02.416
Yes, I know who she works for.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.333
Oh, so you've already met. Well, good.

22:05.416 --> 22:07.166
Sweetheart, now's not the time, really.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.875
She's writing a piece
about my favorite charity

22:09.958 --> 22:11.500
and all the hard work that they've done.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.416
A human-interest companion piece
to our campaign coverage.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.625
Sugar dove--

22:15.708 --> 22:17.166
All she wants is a little background.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.333
She wants to sit down with you
and spend a little time.

22:19.416 --> 22:21.916
And I told her that you'd be glad to.

22:22.666 --> 22:24.833
-So, finish your cake.

22:24.916 --> 22:25.875
Thank you.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.958
Speaking of charity, just a quick question
on the charitable aid--

22:31.041 --> 22:33.666
No comment. Thank you. Goodbye.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.500
- Any, uh--
-No comment.

22:35.583 --> 22:38.041
-Question about the charitable aid...
-Thank you.<i> </i>Goodbye.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.250
-Just a comment?
-Hi. Excuse me.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.750
Sorry, the Secretary is indisposed
for questions at the moment.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.750
So, you'll need to schedule
a formal meeting

22:44.833 --> 22:46.666
through his office to speak with him.

22:49.375 --> 22:50.791
Happy birthday to your wife.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.083
-Thank you.
- <i>It's remarkable, really.</i>

22:57.625 --> 22:59.583
<i>She slipped in and out of El Mozote</i>

22:59.666 --> 23:02.916
<i>with the help of half</i>
<i>the Farabundo Martí Liberation Front.</i>

23:03.125 --> 23:05.166
<i>She's been burning the candle</i>
<i>on both ends ever since.</i>

23:05.916 --> 23:08.666
<i>Everything that happens down here,</i>
<i>she's sourced-up and in print.</i>

23:08.750 --> 23:11.375
<i>Massacres, assassinations,</i>
<i>rigged elections,</i>

23:11.458 --> 23:13.166
<i>the whole supply run from top to bottom.</i>

23:13.583 --> 23:16.541
<i>Unafraid and over-driven,</i>
<i>to put it mildly.</i>

23:16.625 --> 23:18.666
Always a step ahead by a nose.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.458
Just the simple fact that she's down there
reporting on the conflict

23:21.541 --> 23:23.791
is evidence of the kind of instability
we need as a pretext

23:23.875 --> 23:25.541
to justify our military presence.

23:25.791 --> 23:29.458
Look, Treat, if you think this McMahon
inadvertently helps accomplish

23:29.541 --> 23:32.250
a continual motive for our intervention,
then, by all means...

23:32.333 --> 23:34.583
Mr. Secretary,
if I may disagree.

23:34.916 --> 23:38.291
Well, first, the Senator sends
his apologies for not being here himself.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.000
But he, and I, can assure you,
as his chief foreign aid officer,

23:42.083 --> 23:44.250
I hold you in the most capable hands.

23:44.750 --> 23:45.583
That said,

23:46.250 --> 23:50.833
I think it's best if we keep all external
players off the grid at this point.

23:51.291 --> 23:54.166
Obviously, we don't want to compromise
decision-making on our part

23:54.250 --> 23:56.416
by having to address press.

23:56.708 --> 23:58.791
I think you can see
why we've pinned her as a conduit.

23:58.875 --> 24:01.083
She's the bullhorn you don't have to hold.

24:01.166 --> 24:04.250
Mr. Secretary, if there was some way
that we could circle back--

24:04.333 --> 24:07.708
Look, Berquist, please assure the Senator
that we're working very hard

24:07.791 --> 24:09.875
to make sure that our allies in Antigua

24:09.958 --> 24:13.416
and the entire Antillean chain
are clear of any misgivings.

24:13.791 --> 24:15.541
The Basin Initiative is very important,

24:15.625 --> 24:18.541
and it's one that we'll be handling
with, uh, experienced hands.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.083
Fine. That's all.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.000
Give the Senator my regards.

24:24.708 --> 24:26.291
Mr. Secretary, uh...

25:28.750 --> 25:30.916
Hey, you're coming down for drinks, right?

25:31.375 --> 25:32.333
Mike's paying.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.166
All right, attagirl.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.916
<i>♪ Do you want a drink? ♪</i>

25:41.166 --> 25:43.583

26:00.041 --> 26:02.666
Gus, thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.541
Beautiful day for some flag-waving.

26:04.625 --> 26:05.833
It is, it is.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.125
Any day's good for that.

26:08.041 --> 26:10.416
Who doesn't love cheerleaders
and Hank Williams?

26:10.500 --> 26:11.333
Junior.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.166
-Sorry?
-Hank Williams, Jr.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.208
-Oh.
-Different animal entirely.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.375
Wouldn't compare a rock
to the mountain it slid off of, would you?

26:18.458 --> 26:21.666
-Well, when you put it like that...
-No, ma'am. Not on your life.

26:22.083 --> 26:24.583
Not every bull can be a longhorn,
am I right?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.958
Anyway, what you got for me today?

26:27.208 --> 26:30.791
Well, since you were so helpful
in ID'ing those casings--

26:30.875 --> 26:31.916
1982.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.375
El Salvador.

26:33.958 --> 26:35.958
The casings from Lake City, Missouri.

26:36.041 --> 26:38.500
LC80s. NATO standard, am I right?

26:38.583 --> 26:39.500
That's right.

26:40.291 --> 26:41.958
-What you got for me?
-It's these.

26:47.166 --> 26:50.625
Mm-hmm. Munitions shipping crates.
This is army surplus.

26:51.416 --> 26:53.166
Forty-five-millimeter rounds here.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.291
These here are boxes of tracers.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.916
That's for M16s, most likely.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.500
Who's the old man?

27:01.541 --> 27:02.375
Don't know.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.458
Where'd you find this stuff?
National Guard?

27:04.541 --> 27:07.125
I got the pictures cold.
Why the National Guard?

27:07.458 --> 27:10.000
Well, because right now,
Texas, Alabama, Louisiana,

27:10.083 --> 27:13.791
20th Special Forces just declared surplus.
That's the stuff you're looking at.

27:14.208 --> 27:17.250
Equipment, rounds, all subsidized at cost.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.000
None of it's staying put, though.

27:19.791 --> 27:22.666
Gets shipped in and armories
sell half of it right back out.

27:22.958 --> 27:25.083
Buddy of mine tells me
his shipped to Florida.

27:25.375 --> 27:26.666
Miami, Fort Lauderdale.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.666
That School of the Americas camp
I was telling you about.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.208
If the stuff's not staying in Florida,
where's it going?

27:32.291 --> 27:35.125
Bet my Purple Heart it's going
to the same places you've been looking.

27:35.583 --> 27:36.458
Honduras,

27:36.791 --> 27:37.666
Costa Rica.

27:38.291 --> 27:40.166
Close as they can get it to Nicaragua.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.375
Contra supporters from here, you mean?

27:42.458 --> 27:43.833
Contra, Sandinista...

27:44.500 --> 27:47.625
I don't even know the goddamn difference.
Most of the time it don't matter.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.833
-Who's steering the stuff?
- "Steering"?

27:49.916 --> 27:52.041
You let a monkey drive your car,
you call it steering?

27:52.125 --> 27:53.125
Hell no.

27:53.708 --> 27:55.541
You want to see how a monkey drives,

27:56.125 --> 27:56.958
buckle up.

27:57.541 --> 27:58.583
Follow the bananas.

27:59.166 --> 28:02.208
<i>Why are you always dead last</i>
<i>with the campaign polls?</i>

28:02.750 --> 28:04.041
<i>New York Times,</i>

28:04.125 --> 28:05.541
<i>Chicago Tribune,</i>

28:05.625 --> 28:07.458

28:07.541 --> 28:10.875
Shit, probably<i> The Connecticut Lions</i>
<i>High School Newsletter, </i>go blue,

28:10.958 --> 28:13.666
has reported on the California polls
before we have.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.916
The Denver Post <i>is selling out</i>
<i>their late edition</i>

28:16.000 --> 28:18.333
<i>with a piece on Zsa Zsa Gábor's</i>
<i>Bel Air fundraiser.</i>

28:18.416 --> 28:20.041
<i>You're less than two miles from it.</i>

28:20.125 --> 28:23.958
Zsa Zsa Gábor hosting a fundraiser
in Bel Air isn't news, Stewart.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.875
But you know what is?
Surplus arms for Contras.

28:26.958 --> 28:29.541
It's very promising in a campaign year,
am I right?

28:29.625 --> 28:32.916
Government-sponsored violence
to neutralize Nicaraguan officials?

28:33.000 --> 28:36.333
It's very American, it's very
presidential, it's very newsworthy.

28:36.416 --> 28:38.458
<i>I want my polls, Elena.</i>
<i>That's your job.</i>

28:38.541 --> 28:40.666
Bar charts, pie charts, lines and numbers.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.750
I shouldn't have to read
about the polling numbers in Orange County

28:43.833 --> 28:44.958
from the <i>Michigan Gazette.</i>

28:45.041 --> 28:47.208
Who cares about the polling numbers
out of Orange County?

28:47.291 --> 28:48.708
<i>-I want my polls.</i>
-You're serious?

28:48.791 --> 28:50.500
-Oh, my God, you're serious.

28:50.583 --> 28:54.125
The incumbent cowboy is already neck deep
in four years of imperial deceit,

28:54.208 --> 28:56.208
but you're right,
the polls don't reflect that.

28:56.291 --> 28:58.000
-Nor do they reflect...
-McMahon. Live line.

28:58.083 --> 28:59.916
-...I was not on the press manifest...
-McMahon.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.666
so I barely made the fucking plane here.

29:01.750 --> 29:04.958
I don't pay you to editorialize.
You know why? I'm the editor.

29:05.041 --> 29:06.625
Report your numbers like a good reporter.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.416
<i>-Look--</i>
-Drop the tropical angle. Got it?

29:08.500 --> 29:10.500
You just make sure
that I'm on the fucking manifest,

29:10.583 --> 29:13.625
and I'll file your useless
fucking poll numbers on time.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.083
McMahon.

29:22.458 --> 29:23.333
When was this?

29:25.083 --> 29:25.958
Is he stable?

29:32.208 --> 29:33.041
No.

29:33.583 --> 29:36.041
I can't. I'll arrange someone.

29:41.166 --> 29:44.208
<i>Please tell me you did not just</i>
<i>walk off a presidential campaign.</i>

29:44.291 --> 29:45.625
What else could I do?

29:45.708 --> 29:47.125
He's got no one but me.

29:47.208 --> 29:49.375
He never remarried,
he's got no other kids.

29:49.458 --> 29:51.083
No one, just me.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.666
<i>All of a sudden, I was on the plane.</i>

29:52.750 --> 29:55.666
<i>I didn't know I was coming here</i>
<i>till I was here.</i> <i>So...</i>

29:56.333 --> 29:58.541
Do what you got to do. Tell Stewart...

30:01.541 --> 30:03.458
I don't care. Tell Stewart whatever.

30:03.541 --> 30:05.833
I'm in Miami until... until I don't know.

30:05.916 --> 30:07.875
<i>No, I'll file for you.</i>
<i>You take the weekend.</i>

30:07.958 --> 30:09.125
Get your head together.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.291
<i>Come on, Alma,</i>

30:10.375 --> 30:14.166
<i>I could file that type of rundown</i>
<i>in my sleep till November, you know that.</i>

30:15.125 --> 30:16.125
Right now, I just...

30:22.041 --> 30:22.875
I can't.

30:23.833 --> 30:25.291
Consider me off indefinitely.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.541
You don't sound too good.

30:29.291 --> 30:30.625
I'm gonna come down there.

30:30.958 --> 30:34.375
<i>Don't. If he wasn't out cold,</i>
<i>I wouldn't even be calling you.</i>

30:35.750 --> 30:37.958
I haven't eaten in 28 hours.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.375
Alma, I just, I...

30:42.041 --> 30:43.958
<i>Code vi, code violet. Room 308.</i>

30:44.041 --> 30:44.958
Goddamn it!

30:45.041 --> 30:46.625
<i>Code violet. Room 308.</i>

30:46.708 --> 30:47.916
Get me out of here!

30:48.000 --> 30:48.833
Sir.

30:48.916 --> 30:50.416
- Goddamn Epperson.
-Mr. McMahon.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.333
-Where are my shoes, for Christ's sakes?
-Dad.

30:52.416 --> 30:55.666
-It's okay. Dad, Dad.
-Get me outta here, I gotta go!

30:55.750 --> 30:58.166
-No, it's okay.
-I gotta go, Kitty, I gotta go.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.250
-Just hang on. Dad.
-Goddamn Epperson.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.708
The bastard.
He quoted me three per on the 69s.

31:03.791 --> 31:05.833
- You're going to feel better.
-Now he tells me

31:05.916 --> 31:07.375
-the market dropped to two.
-Easy.

31:07.958 --> 31:08.791
That's not the deal.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.583
-He'll queer the whole thing up.
-Dad.

31:10.666 --> 31:13.083
-I needed this. Kitty.
- It's gonna be fine.

31:13.833 --> 31:14.666
Kitty.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.416
Dad, it's...

31:20.000 --> 31:20.916
It's Elena.

31:22.791 --> 31:25.333
-Ellie.
- Yeah. It's Ellie.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.541
Somebody's waiting for me.

31:27.625 --> 31:30.416
-I got somebody to see.
-Listen to me. Listen to me.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.916
You're not thinking clearly.

31:32.875 --> 31:34.541
You're not in any condition
to do anything.

31:34.625 --> 31:37.125
You're gonna make a mistake,
you're gonna get hurt.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.416
You have to do it.

31:41.083 --> 31:41.916
Do what?

31:42.208 --> 31:45.125
I told you. I told you the whole deal.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.041
Meet Kitty. <i>Kitty Rex.</i>

31:49.916 --> 31:50.958
You mean your boat?

31:52.291 --> 31:53.416
Goddamn, Ellie.

31:54.666 --> 31:56.291
-Goddamn.
- Hey.

31:57.333 --> 31:58.541
What's gonna happen now?

31:59.958 --> 32:01.041
I'll take care of it.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.041
He ain't here.

32:24.166 --> 32:25.375
You the daughter?

35:26.250 --> 35:30.250
<i>The bastard quoted me three per</i>
<i>on the 69s.</i>

35:30.500 --> 35:34.083
<i>Now he tells me</i>
<i>that the market dropped to two.</i>

35:35.666 --> 35:37.875
<i>I got a big deal coming. </i>The <i>big deal.</i>

35:37.958 --> 35:40.833
- <i>Dare I ask what the product is?</i>
- <i>Same as it ever was.</i>

35:47.208 --> 35:49.250
<i>Take your time, Mr. McMahon.</i>
<i>I won't rush you.</i>

35:49.708 --> 35:52.583
Can you tell me the name
of the current US president?

35:56.708 --> 35:59.500
I get the game. I get it.
I'm supposed to say "Herbert Hoover,"

35:59.583 --> 36:01.583
and the guy puts me away in some home.

36:01.666 --> 36:03.125
I get it. All right.

36:03.208 --> 36:04.500
<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

36:05.666 --> 36:07.125
Herbert Hoover.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.875
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
Harry S. Truman,

36:09.958 --> 36:13.333
Dwight David Eisenhower,
John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

36:13.416 --> 36:14.916
Lyndon Baines Johnson,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.625
Richard Milhous Nixon,

36:16.916 --> 36:19.791
Gerald whatever his name was,
kept tripping over his feet,

36:19.875 --> 36:21.583
Jimmy something, the Christer,

36:21.666 --> 36:22.791
and the one now,

36:22.875 --> 36:25.666
the one the old dummy's
not meant to remember.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.791
The other old dummy, Reagan.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.166
Excellent, Mr. McMahon.
You deserve first prize.

36:31.583 --> 36:34.333
First prize is that you leave.

36:35.416 --> 36:36.875
I'll go get the paperwork.

36:37.291 --> 36:38.791
Dad, what the hell?

36:39.583 --> 36:41.916
I put this thing together
on credit, Ellie.

36:42.250 --> 36:46.416
Five, ten years ago, I wouldn't have
gone out on a limb this way.

36:46.750 --> 36:50.458
Do it clean. That's my strict motto.
Cash and carry, but this is the one.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.750
I called in all my favors.

36:51.833 --> 36:54.458
I got paper spread from here to Chicago,

36:54.541 --> 36:55.833
just this one last time.

36:55.916 --> 36:59.791
One million in Citibank traveler's checks,
good as gold.

37:00.291 --> 37:02.125
I know how it sounds, but it's real.

37:02.208 --> 37:04.625
I know what I'm saying, Ellie.
It's me. I'm here.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.833
I need you to look up a name for me.
Max Epperson.

37:07.916 --> 37:09.458
<i>That's E-P-P--</i>

37:09.541 --> 37:11.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Based out of Tampa,

37:11.416 --> 37:13.916
<i>-but look for anything in south Florida.</i>
-He's American?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.583
I don't even know if he's real.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.625
<i>Million-dollar pay date.</i>

37:17.708 --> 37:23.375
'Course, I have to turn half of it back
to the goons that advanced me, but...

37:23.458 --> 37:25.541
That complicates my situation, Ellie,

37:25.625 --> 37:28.125
but you see the situation I'm in.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.166
Do it, or not.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.791
I'm already in the bag for 500k.

37:33.375 --> 37:34.333
Jesus.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.041
I might send you some photos.

37:43.083 --> 37:43.958
<i>Elena?</i>

37:45.583 --> 37:46.583
It's all set up.

37:46.666 --> 37:48.000
Elena, hello?

37:48.541 --> 37:50.375
My dad is into some shit.

37:51.041 --> 37:52.208
Please, just go.

37:52.750 --> 37:53.791
Talk to my guy.

37:54.750 --> 37:58.125
I'm meeting some friend of his tomorrow.
I...

37:58.208 --> 37:59.083
<i>You got a name?</i>

37:59.166 --> 38:01.791
No, but if I don't call you
by, say, one, then, you know--

38:01.875 --> 38:03.666
<i>If I don't hear from you</i>
<i>by one o'clock,</i>

38:03.750 --> 38:04.958
<i>I'm gonna steal your identity,</i>

38:05.916 --> 38:07.208
write the shit out of this piece,

38:07.291 --> 38:09.958
and thank your posthumous ass
in my Pulitzer speech.

38:10.791 --> 38:11.833
I love you.

38:11.916 --> 38:12.791
<i>I know you do.</i>

38:13.375 --> 38:16.083
<i>Now buck up, bucko.</i>
<i>Can't be worse than Salvador.</i>

38:27.750 --> 38:29.625
No place in this sweet, hot town

38:29.708 --> 38:31.833
you can't change a thousand dollar bill.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.916
Looks like
you're waiting for somebody.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.125
I think you.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.625
First things first, how's Dick?

39:26.958 --> 39:29.250
Must be pretty bad
to be sidelining a deal like this.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.541
You know, he's doing much better.
I'll tell him you asked.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.458
No, don't do that. Don't mention it.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.666
Look, before I forget,

39:36.500 --> 39:39.583
if you need anything at all,
you call me first.

39:40.916 --> 39:41.791
Okay?

39:42.208 --> 39:43.250
This is my card.

39:43.708 --> 39:44.541
It's a pager.

39:45.541 --> 39:47.375
What could I possibly need?

39:47.458 --> 39:50.250
You could need a lot of things,
but let's not worry about that.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.833
Let's worry about getting things right.

39:51.916 --> 39:53.000
What does that look like?

39:53.083 --> 39:55.333
That looks like
you taking a cab to the airport.

39:55.833 --> 39:58.041
<i>Okay? Don't drive yourself,</i>
<i>you take a cab.</i>

39:58.125 --> 40:02.375
<i>Be at the Pan Am Clipper Club</i>
<i>at noon sharp.</i> <i>You understand?</i>

40:02.458 --> 40:05.791
<i>Don't be early. Don't be late.</i>
<i>You be on time.</i>

40:05.875 --> 40:07.875
<i>What you're gonna wanna do then</i>
<i>is go to the desk,</i>

40:07.958 --> 40:09.125
<i>ask for Michelle.</i>

40:09.208 --> 40:11.375
<i>Michelle is the blonde, not the spic.</i>

40:11.458 --> 40:13.666
<i>The other one is Delia, she don't know me.</i>

40:13.750 --> 40:15.916
<i>And then, you gonna wanna say...</i>

40:16.000 --> 40:17.583
I'm here to see Gary Barnett.

40:17.666 --> 40:18.916
Of course, welcome.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.666
Gary wants you
to make yourself comfortable.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.458
If I could please see
your Clipper Club card?

40:22.541 --> 40:24.625
- I saw her card.
-Just sign in here, please.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.583
Allow me, ma'am. Right this way.

40:34.791 --> 40:38.708
- <i>So who exactly is Gary Barnett?</i>
- <i>Don't worry, he'll know you.</i>

40:38.791 --> 40:42.250
<i>Other than that, blend in.</i>
<i>Don't let yourself be noticed.</i>

40:42.583 --> 40:44.125
Can I get you anything else?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.708
All right, then.
You're telling me that we do have it.

40:46.791 --> 40:48.083
Okay. Well, then.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.416
Here you go, sir.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.083
I--

40:52.250 --> 40:55.333
I came all the way up from San Salvador
to close the deal.

40:56.625 --> 41:00.083
Yeah, because we are losing
our credibility with the client, you know?

41:01.500 --> 41:04.458
Ninety-two million dollars
is not chickenshit, Mr. Lee.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.625
Just-- No, no.

41:06.708 --> 41:07.541
It--

41:07.625 --> 41:08.458
Mr. Lee?

41:29.291 --> 41:30.541
Excuse me, miss.

41:30.916 --> 41:32.583
You're not authorized to be here.

41:34.208 --> 41:37.708
-Uh, Michelle said that--
-This club is members only.

41:37.791 --> 41:39.708
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.875
This way, please.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.458
<i>So you let yourself be noticed.</i>

41:49.875 --> 41:51.041
<i>Noticed by who?</i>

41:52.333 --> 41:54.250
Noticed by somebody you shouldn't have.

41:54.750 --> 41:55.791
Ellie, who's that?

41:55.875 --> 41:58.083
You know what I think?
You're jerking me around.

41:58.166 --> 42:00.625
Yeah, show up here, show up there,
speak to so-and-so, sit here.

42:00.708 --> 42:02.708
It's all been
pseudo cloak-and-dagger bullshit,

42:02.791 --> 42:04.375
-and I am not amused.
- Ellie?

42:04.458 --> 42:07.583
Can you get the rent-a-sitter
to fix me another bourbon?

42:08.083 --> 42:10.000
So what? So what?

42:10.083 --> 42:12.500
You're selling a few
third-rate military leftovers

42:12.583 --> 42:15.666
<i>to second-rate revolutionaries</i>
<i>at I'm guessing first-rate markups?</i>

42:15.750 --> 42:17.125
So fucking what?

42:17.750 --> 42:20.083
That story's already been written
a couple of times.

42:20.166 --> 42:22.625
<i>Miami Herald, </i>pick any section.
I'll give you a dime to print...

42:22.708 --> 42:24.958
It's just a microfiche,
but the real headline is,

42:25.041 --> 42:27.041
you're just not
that fucking important anymore.

42:27.125 --> 42:29.375
You're a no-name, an anecdote,
history's footnote.

42:29.458 --> 42:32.000
So enjoy your war games.
I'm going back to my life.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.708
Ellie? Ellie?

42:34.166 --> 42:36.166
-Ellie!
-Need to lie down for a bit, Dad!

42:36.791 --> 42:38.708
<i>If you choose to live</i>
<i>a perverted lifestyle,</i>

42:38.791 --> 42:40.333
<i>you shouldn't ask to be rewarded for it.</i>

42:41.875 --> 42:44.125
<i>You should have the right to live,</i>
<i>do and act as you please</i>

42:44.208 --> 42:45.541
<i>with no one invading your bedroom.</i>

42:45.625 --> 42:48.541
<i>But you should not expect the government</i>
<i>to reward you for your misbehavior.</i>

42:48.625 --> 42:52.000
<i>So here. We're not out to deny</i>
<i>civil rights for anyone.</i>

42:52.083 --> 42:54.333
<i>We're not out</i>
<i>to give special privileges...</i>

43:21.750 --> 43:25.000
<i>Well, what has Nicaragua</i>
<i>done to us to make you so angry?</i>

43:25.083 --> 43:28.458
- You're just... Dad!
-Jesus, what the hell are you doing?

43:28.750 --> 43:29.750
-You were out?
-Right.

43:29.833 --> 43:32.208
Where is the nurse?
You shouldn't be driving!

43:32.291 --> 43:33.958
What am I supposed to do,
take my teeth out

43:34.041 --> 43:35.250
and go into the nursing home?

43:35.333 --> 43:36.375
You want a drink?

43:37.833 --> 43:40.208
I sent her home.
She's not a real nurse anyway.

43:42.041 --> 43:43.875
Jeez Louise.

43:46.166 --> 43:48.291
-Scared the shit out of me.

43:49.875 --> 43:50.875
What's this shit?

43:51.541 --> 43:55.041
If you were interested at all
in what I'm doing as I told you before...

43:56.666 --> 43:59.833
If it pans out
the way it's supposed to pan out,

44:00.458 --> 44:02.541
I'll be in a position to fold my hand,

44:02.625 --> 44:04.375
take the Kitty Rex down past Largo,

44:04.458 --> 44:07.125
and just stay there, catching fish,

44:07.708 --> 44:09.250
bumming around the shallows,

44:09.333 --> 44:11.250
sleeping with newly widowed--

44:11.333 --> 44:12.166
Dad.

44:12.250 --> 44:16.458
Of course, that's not my original idea
of a good time, but...

44:16.708 --> 44:19.583
it beats sitting around here, getting old.

44:24.125 --> 44:25.250
Now...

44:26.041 --> 44:27.708
I patched things up with Sedlow.

44:28.041 --> 44:30.166
All you have to do
is fly down there tomorrow

44:30.250 --> 44:33.083
and make the collection for me, please.

44:37.541 --> 44:38.500
Please, Ellie.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.333
Ellie...

44:53.000 --> 44:54.291
Thank you, Jesus.

44:57.125 --> 45:00.333
When's the last time you heard
from your mother? Pretty Kitty.

45:00.583 --> 45:01.916
My Kit-Cat.

45:04.250 --> 45:06.583
She should really call me more often,
you know?

45:16.458 --> 45:18.666
- That's not the deal.
-So what is our deal?

45:18.750 --> 45:22.250
You tell me to show up, I show up.
Feels like you just trotted me around.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.416
Can you blame me? Huh?

45:25.125 --> 45:26.541
Look, I don't know you.

45:26.625 --> 45:30.708
What, all of a sudden I'm just supposed
to trust you because the old man sent you?

45:30.875 --> 45:32.250
That's not how it works.

45:32.625 --> 45:35.208
-And what if I don't like how it works?
- You don't like it?

45:35.291 --> 45:38.250
You don't like it?
Let me tell you something.

45:38.333 --> 45:40.708
This isn't no fucking
restaurant review, okay?

45:40.791 --> 45:42.208
"You don't like it."

45:50.333 --> 45:51.583
See these crates?

45:52.541 --> 45:53.833
All this is you now.

45:54.583 --> 45:56.208
Is there an inventory list?

45:56.625 --> 45:59.708
Everything is here.
They know what they're buying. Okay?

46:00.583 --> 46:02.625
If somebody tells you something is off,

46:03.166 --> 46:04.666
which nothing is,

46:05.125 --> 46:07.541
you tell them to go fuck themselves.

46:08.125 --> 46:09.041
Okay?

46:09.125 --> 46:10.500
You just make sure

46:10.583 --> 46:13.958
that you don't take your eyes
off of any of this

46:14.041 --> 46:16.791
until they pay.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.291
Dick said a million in traveler's checks.

46:19.833 --> 46:22.416
Who's dropping it? Who's counting it?
Where will you be in all this?

46:22.500 --> 46:23.958
Somebody's going to meet you.

46:24.041 --> 46:26.166
Your need-to-know has stopped right there.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.083
You just be at gate J

46:28.166 --> 46:30.166
at midnight by yourself,

46:30.541 --> 46:34.458
ready to get on the plane
and get the deal done.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.166
Period.

46:38.333 --> 46:39.833
You spit when you talk.

46:39.916 --> 46:41.041
You love it.

46:46.208 --> 46:48.750
Why do you have a bag? Don't take a bag.
You're not staying.

46:48.833 --> 46:50.958
You deliver the goods,
you pick up the payment,

46:51.041 --> 46:53.125
and you get on the plane. That's my deal.

46:53.541 --> 46:56.458
-I thought Cheers was on--
-Get the babysitter out of here.

46:56.541 --> 46:57.416
Do you mind?

46:59.208 --> 47:00.583
That one's not a real nurse.

47:00.666 --> 47:02.833
The one that comes in the morning
is a nurse.

47:02.916 --> 47:05.333
This one's a babysitter
and she steals my shoes.

47:05.416 --> 47:08.083
-Okay, Dad...
-Don't let anybody Mickey Mouse you

47:08.166 --> 47:10.125
into staying. You follow me?

47:10.208 --> 47:12.541
If anyone gives you a hard time,
you just tell 'em.

47:12.625 --> 47:13.458
Tell 'em what?

47:13.833 --> 47:15.916
Tell 'em... God damn...

47:16.750 --> 47:17.708
You're...

47:19.250 --> 47:21.041
Tell 'em they have to answer
to Max Epperson,

47:21.125 --> 47:22.958
and then you call. Promise you'll call.

47:23.416 --> 47:25.291
-Okay. I'll call you.
-You'll call me.

47:40.083 --> 47:41.000
Oh.

47:41.291 --> 47:42.166
I remember.

48:05.041 --> 48:06.666
Must be my frequent flyer.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.250
First class right there.

48:23.791 --> 48:24.750
All you.

49:15.875 --> 49:18.166
Smells like Christmas.

49:18.625 --> 49:20.625
That makes you Mrs. Claus.

49:21.083 --> 49:23.000
Let's see who's been naughty. Open one.

49:23.083 --> 49:24.708
- What?
-Open one.

49:25.541 --> 49:26.791
Let's see what's inside.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.500
Open it yourself.

49:31.041 --> 49:32.708
That's not how things work.

49:32.791 --> 49:35.000
I got nowhere particular to be, so...

49:35.958 --> 49:36.958
it's up to you.

49:49.333 --> 49:50.166
Open.

49:56.166 --> 50:00.208
Colt's classic ArmaLite rifle <i>número </i>15.

50:00.291 --> 50:01.625
To military spec.

50:02.041 --> 50:03.625
Where did you find this shit, huh?

50:04.041 --> 50:05.458
Three-prong suppressor,

50:05.541 --> 50:07.291
high-impact fiber stock,

50:07.958 --> 50:10.166
trigger-finger magazine release.

50:11.958 --> 50:12.791
That'll work.

50:15.375 --> 50:16.458
Oh.

50:16.541 --> 50:19.041
A Valmara 69.

50:19.416 --> 50:22.833
Mrs. Claus, you shouldn't have!

-No, no, no. What's your name?

51:11.625 --> 51:13.375
I didn't ask you for your name.

51:13.791 --> 51:15.375
And you don't need to know mine.

51:21.333 --> 51:23.458
Hey, hey, somebody was supposed to meet me
with payment.

51:23.541 --> 51:24.375
Good luck with that.

51:31.666 --> 51:32.875
Is this the payment?

51:33.250 --> 51:35.875
Fly it down, fly it back.
That's my contract.

51:41.208 --> 51:42.333
Is this the payment?

51:56.125 --> 51:57.833
-Got what you need?
- Shit.

51:58.291 --> 51:59.500
Looks like you got shorted.

52:02.583 --> 52:06.375
-Now you're short, too. We're not leaving.
-I told you, I fly it down, I fly it back.

52:06.458 --> 52:09.500
I don't take care of cargo,
and I don't take care of passengers.

52:09.583 --> 52:10.500
Wheels up, two minutes.

52:31.541 --> 52:33.916
- You're supposed to pay me.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.958
Now, who forgot to tell me that?

52:38.041 --> 52:40.041
If I don't get paid, and I don't show up,

52:40.125 --> 52:41.708
they're gonna be wondering why.

52:42.125 --> 52:44.166
-Who's going to wonder?
- I think you know who.

52:45.875 --> 52:46.750
Give me a name.

52:53.125 --> 52:53.958
Epperson.

52:54.583 --> 52:55.708
Max Epperson?

53:25.791 --> 53:27.541
What are we doing here?
Is this the pick-up?

53:27.625 --> 53:28.708
You're doing nothing.

53:29.166 --> 53:31.125
And what I'm doing doesn't concern you.

54:12.250 --> 54:14.625
Anyone asks,
tell them that you're waiting for Jones.

54:50.958 --> 54:52.708
May I take your photo?

54:54.875 --> 54:56.875
-Beautiful.

55:20.791 --> 55:22.250
Okay. Thank you.

55:29.333 --> 55:31.000
Why'd you bring her here?

55:32.083 --> 55:34.583
-You had one job, and one job only.

55:34.666 --> 55:37.000
Driving the cattle
through the goddamn fence.

55:37.416 --> 55:39.708
Since you're the one
who drove her to the fence,

55:39.791 --> 55:41.166
you better manage it.

55:41.250 --> 55:42.333
Hey.

55:43.125 --> 55:44.083
What are you doing?

55:46.416 --> 55:47.250
What's your name?

55:49.375 --> 55:50.208
Making friends?

55:51.583 --> 55:53.041
Just pass!

55:53.125 --> 55:56.250
Jones! Gonna introduce your lady?

56:30.041 --> 56:31.750

56:34.958 --> 56:38.333
Hey, look, I'm just passing time.

56:41.041 --> 56:42.041
Who sent you?

56:46.791 --> 56:49.000
Nobody sent me. Who sent you?

56:52.833 --> 56:54.458
Maybe we should make a pit stop.

56:54.833 --> 56:55.708
We can keep going.

56:55.791 --> 56:59.166
-Might be nice to stop. Talk a little.
-Just drive, please.

57:00.875 --> 57:02.833
Nice break could do us both some good.

57:03.500 --> 57:05.916
You know, Epperson expects me in San José
as soon as possible.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.583
You think anyone give a shit about you
out here?

57:10.208 --> 57:12.875
I bet you didn't even tell anybody
where you're going.

57:16.208 --> 57:17.083
Top secret?

57:20.250 --> 57:22.000
Let's see things for what they are.

57:22.541 --> 57:24.000
First and foremost,

57:25.083 --> 57:26.291
you skipped your flight.

57:27.166 --> 57:28.208
Second...

57:29.625 --> 57:31.083
there's nothing for you here.

57:32.041 --> 57:36.208
Nothing back on the airstrip and nothing
ahead in San José, let's be honest.

57:37.333 --> 57:38.750
-Third--

57:39.916 --> 57:42.041
- What the fuck?

57:46.166 --> 57:49.041
Without fucking around,
you are gonna get out of this car.

57:49.125 --> 57:51.666
You know how to use that thing,
fucking cocktail dress?

57:54.416 --> 57:55.333
Slide across.

57:56.541 --> 57:57.375
Okay.

57:58.250 --> 57:59.250
Get out of the car.

58:00.666 --> 58:01.500
Come on.

58:05.666 --> 58:07.791
-Get out of the car.

58:10.541 --> 58:11.708
Kick the door.

58:13.583 --> 58:14.583
And back away.

58:19.125 --> 58:20.541
You think you're gonna get very far?

58:22.625 --> 58:23.750
You'd be surprised.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:09.500
Alma, it's me.

1:00:10.625 --> 1:00:12.250
I need to know what you found
on Epperson.

1:00:14.166 --> 1:00:16.500
It's five in the morning.

1:00:16.958 --> 1:00:18.625
<i>Anything on him in Managua?</i>

1:00:19.833 --> 1:00:20.666
Shit.

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:22.791
I didn't expect a pop quiz.

1:00:22.875 --> 1:00:25.333
Uh, anything connecting him to Costa Rica?

1:00:25.416 --> 1:00:27.666
<i>-</i>Is he American, is he--
- <i>No, listen, I...</i>

1:00:27.750 --> 1:00:29.166
<i>I didn't find anything</i>

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:31.916
on anyone named Max Epperson.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:32.833
Nothing.

1:00:33.250 --> 1:00:34.583
Like he doesn't exist.

1:00:34.916 --> 1:00:37.166
You think that maybe your dad
got it wrong or something?

1:00:37.250 --> 1:00:39.458
No, no, no, no, no. Jones knew the name.
I used it--

1:00:39.541 --> 1:00:40.500
Who's Jones?

1:00:40.958 --> 1:00:42.541
What happened? Where are you, exactly?

1:00:43.541 --> 1:00:47.416
Listen, the plane, we landed... I don't
know where. Somewhere in Nicaragua.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.000
It took seven hours to drive here, so--

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:52.416
Drive? Wait, wait, w-- Where's "here"?

1:00:52.625 --> 1:00:54.625
<i>San José. I'm in Costa Rica.</i>

1:00:54.708 --> 1:00:58.166
The shipment, it was huge.

1:00:58.250 --> 1:01:00.250
Landmines, antipersonnel weapons...

1:01:00.333 --> 1:01:03.666
Only, it's not money they're sending back
to the mainland, it's cocaine.

1:01:03.750 --> 1:01:05.708
And it's financing for something else.

1:01:05.791 --> 1:01:07.041
And this guy, Jones,

1:01:07.833 --> 1:01:10.000
I think he's in with the Sandinistas.

1:01:10.083 --> 1:01:11.083
He's working both sides.

1:01:11.166 --> 1:01:13.083
That makes no sense.

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:14.333
<i>I know.</i>

1:01:15.083 --> 1:01:16.833
I know it was a quick decision,
staying on,

1:01:16.916 --> 1:01:18.500
but I wanna track it from this end.

1:01:18.583 --> 1:01:20.125
Dick wasn't in the loop on any of this.

1:01:20.208 --> 1:01:22.833
If I'd have gone back,
things would've evaporated.

1:01:23.291 --> 1:01:25.083
Send you what I have when I can.

1:01:25.541 --> 1:01:26.375
Listen,

1:01:26.458 --> 1:01:29.041
something did come up
from one of the stringers down in Miami

1:01:29.125 --> 1:01:31.333
when they were digging around
about Epperson.

1:01:31.708 --> 1:01:33.416
A guy named Bob Weir.

1:01:34.333 --> 1:01:36.416
Dick never mentioned anyone by that name.

1:01:36.500 --> 1:01:38.166
Well, apparently, this Bob Weir

1:01:38.250 --> 1:01:41.166
has a flair for showing up
in interesting situations.

1:01:41.791 --> 1:01:45.083
He was in Guatemala, for example,
when Árbenz was overthrown.

1:01:45.583 --> 1:01:48.208
He was in Managua
when Somoza was overthrown,

1:01:48.291 --> 1:01:49.958
and you remember San Salvador,

1:01:50.666 --> 1:01:51.833
<i>the press office raid?</i>

1:01:52.458 --> 1:01:55.791
The editor-in-chief,
five other writers were assassinated

1:01:56.125 --> 1:01:59.625
and guess who the last guy
to go through the door was?

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:04.333
So Weir's CIA?

1:02:04.416 --> 1:02:08.625
He could be CIA, he could be an asset,
or he could just be a reliable source.

1:02:09.125 --> 1:02:09.958
No one knows.

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:12.250
<i>No one's been able</i>
<i>to get a read on this guy.</i>

1:02:12.583 --> 1:02:15.000
And he's got the kind of face
that you don't see.

1:02:15.333 --> 1:02:16.625
All we do know about him

1:02:17.291 --> 1:02:18.416
is when he shows up,

1:02:19.583 --> 1:02:21.916
it's usually the end of something,
not the beginning.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.458
<i>And guess whose name just showed up</i>
<i>in Costa Rica?</i>

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.333
Not bad for a 5:00 a.m. pop quiz,
Guerrero.

1:02:32.375 --> 1:02:33.375
<i>I'll be careful.</i>

1:02:34.375 --> 1:02:37.000
<i>Listen, can you, uh,</i>
<i>get in touch with Dick for me?</i>

1:02:37.458 --> 1:02:39.708
<i>-Let him know I'll be back tomorrow.</i>
- All right.

1:02:40.708 --> 1:02:41.541
Thanks.

1:02:47.416 --> 1:02:49.916
And, if you please, your passport.
I need to make a copy.

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:51.750
Oh. Yeah, that's fine.

1:02:51.833 --> 1:02:52.666
Thank you.

1:02:53.500 --> 1:02:55.041
-Here's your keys.
-Oh.

1:02:55.125 --> 1:02:56.125
You're all set.

1:03:04.208 --> 1:03:05.791
- Cleaning.
<i>-No, gracias.</i>

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.541
<i>You're driving the cattle</i>
<i>through the goddamn fence.</i>

1:03:26.625 --> 1:03:28.750
<i>Anyone asks,</i>
<i>tell them you're waiting for Jones.</i>

1:03:28.833 --> 1:03:31.208
<i>You just missed my partner.</i>
<i>You know him, Epperson.</i>

1:03:31.291 --> 1:03:34.666
<i>I didn't find anything</i>
<i>on Max Epperson. Nothing.</i>

1:03:34.750 --> 1:03:37.041
<i>You think that maybe</i>
<i>your dad got it wrong or something?</i>

1:03:52.666 --> 1:03:53.500
<i>Hello.</i>

1:03:54.458 --> 1:03:55.375
<i>You there?</i>

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:02.208
Hello?

1:04:04.125 --> 1:04:04.958
<i>Hello?</i>

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:08.375
Look, you don't want to talk, I get it.

1:04:09.083 --> 1:04:10.125
How did you find me?

1:04:11.083 --> 1:04:14.166
<i>You weren't on the plane,</i>
<i>so where else could you be?</i>

1:04:14.791 --> 1:04:15.791
White woman,

1:04:16.041 --> 1:04:17.375
middle of San José,

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.500
middle of the night,
only two hotels in town...

1:04:21.708 --> 1:04:24.500
You don't have to be a super sleuth
to figure it out.

1:04:24.583 --> 1:04:27.125
<i>Honey, relax,</i>
<i>you're worse than your dad.</i>

1:04:28.333 --> 1:04:31.250
<i>Look, let me just ask you something.</i>

1:04:31.333 --> 1:04:32.916
You tell me something.

1:04:34.166 --> 1:04:36.625
Who was your guy
that met the shipment in Florida?

1:04:36.708 --> 1:04:38.458
'Cause it wasn't traveler's checks.

1:04:39.583 --> 1:04:41.666
<i>I know you're not doing this by yourself.</i>

1:04:42.666 --> 1:04:45.125
Look, take it easy, McMahon, okay?

1:04:45.208 --> 1:04:46.708
Just back up a few steps.

1:04:46.791 --> 1:04:48.958
The money is moving, okay?

1:04:49.041 --> 1:04:51.875
<i>It's not like</i>
<i>buying an ice cream cone.</i>

1:04:51.958 --> 1:04:53.125
<i>There's paperwork.</i>

1:04:53.208 --> 1:04:55.750
Fuck you, Barry!
These guys are not doing paperwork.

1:04:55.833 --> 1:04:57.583
But you know who does do paperwork?

1:04:57.875 --> 1:05:01.333
Uninvited guests
in DEA jackets and ATF hats.

1:05:01.416 --> 1:05:03.458
What's the address again?

1:05:03.541 --> 1:05:06.666
Of the... mechanic's garage
with no wrenches?

1:05:06.750 --> 1:05:10.041
1665 Southwest 17th Street?
You're open late, right?

1:05:10.125 --> 1:05:13.208
It's not me calling the shots here.

1:05:13.291 --> 1:05:15.250
<i>I want what my father is owed.</i>

1:05:15.333 --> 1:05:17.666
I want a plane ticket outta here tomorrow.

1:05:18.250 --> 1:05:20.708
<i>You stay in the room.</i>
<i>Somebody will be in touch.</i>

1:05:22.791 --> 1:05:24.625
<i>You have to consider</i>
<i>the alternatives.</i>

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:26.708
You can create a context for democracy

1:05:26.791 --> 1:05:28.625
and maybe get your hands
a little bit dirty,

1:05:28.708 --> 1:05:30.958
or just opt out
and let the other guy call it.

1:05:31.333 --> 1:05:33.291
And the "other guys" being,

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:35.291
in this case, the Sandinistas?

1:05:36.041 --> 1:05:38.833
-The "other guy" being socialism.
- Ah.

1:05:38.916 --> 1:05:41.083
-"Communism by any other name..."
-Mm-hmm.

1:05:41.166 --> 1:05:42.250
Um, and, so...

1:05:42.625 --> 1:05:44.125
to the best of your knowledge,

1:05:45.083 --> 1:05:49.333
could it be true that...
there are certain flights, certain...

1:05:50.333 --> 1:05:52.666
unreported humanitarian aid flights

1:05:52.958 --> 1:05:56.250
that quietly leave
one or another southern city

1:05:56.625 --> 1:05:58.375
with uninspected cargo...

1:05:59.750 --> 1:06:01.833
whose destination is San José?

1:06:03.750 --> 1:06:05.041
Flights that, of course,

1:06:05.625 --> 1:06:06.833
don't land

1:06:06.916 --> 1:06:09.708
in San José,
and literally fly under the radar

1:06:09.791 --> 1:06:14.000
for the purpose of supplying arms
to these so-called Contra forces.

1:06:15.250 --> 1:06:17.916
No. Such flights could not be occurring.

1:06:18.916 --> 1:06:21.708
Or such flights could be occurring,
if in fact they are occurring,

1:06:21.791 --> 1:06:25.041
outside the range of the possible
knowledge of our intelligence agencies.

1:06:25.125 --> 1:06:26.041
So which is it?

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.208
Are they occurring
or are they not occurring?

1:06:29.666 --> 1:06:32.166
We don't... we don't track
that kind of activity.

1:06:32.958 --> 1:06:36.166
Could someone in the administration
have an interest in the area?

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:41.375
It would go without saying
that we have an interest.

1:06:42.208 --> 1:06:43.125
Hmm.

1:06:45.166 --> 1:06:49.500
Well, thank you for speaking with me
on such short notice. I appreciate it.

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:53.416
Oh, no, no, no. I have this.

1:06:53.750 --> 1:06:54.875
Hooray for women's lib.

1:06:55.875 --> 1:06:58.666
May I cite you as a source
close to the White House?

1:06:58.750 --> 1:07:00.208
No. Thank you.

1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:45.041
Everything was to your liking?

1:07:47.541 --> 1:07:48.541
Taxi, madam?

1:07:49.750 --> 1:07:50.750
Yeah.

1:08:00.875 --> 1:08:01.875
Next, please.

1:08:10.875 --> 1:08:13.333
- Thank you.

1:08:13.833 --> 1:08:14.666
Thank you.

1:08:19.625 --> 1:08:20.833
Thank you.

1:08:20.916 --> 1:08:22.916
-Next, please.

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.625
<i>-If you please, your passport.</i>

1:08:25.708 --> 1:08:27.916
<i>You stay in the room.</i>
<i>Somebody'll be in touch.</i>

1:08:30.958 --> 1:08:33.458
- Thank you.
- <i>Think you're gonna get very far?</i>

1:08:33.666 --> 1:08:34.666
Next, please.

1:08:35.125 --> 1:08:36.000
Next, please.

1:08:36.708 --> 1:08:37.708
Step forward, please.

1:08:40.708 --> 1:08:42.166
Purpose of your visit to Costa Rica?

1:08:43.166 --> 1:08:44.166
Vacation.

1:08:44.833 --> 1:08:45.708
How long?

1:08:46.625 --> 1:08:48.916
Uh, uh, uh, two days ago.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.833
The agency said I didn't need a passport,
but I got one anyway.

1:08:51.916 --> 1:08:54.166
And the, uh, agency
gave me a tourist card,

1:08:54.250 --> 1:08:55.791
which I gave to the officer, so...

1:08:55.875 --> 1:08:57.375
Excuse me. Hey, miss!

1:08:57.458 --> 1:08:59.250
Miss! Miss, miss!

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:00.958
Miss! Hey.

1:09:01.375 --> 1:09:03.958
Miss, you forgot your bag. Your bag.

1:09:04.041 --> 1:09:04.875
No...

1:09:04.958 --> 1:09:07.666
-Yes, you forgot your bag.
-No, you're mistaken. This is not my bag.

1:09:07.750 --> 1:09:09.041
-Here, take this.
-No, no!

1:09:09.125 --> 1:09:10.333
-That's not my bag!
-It's yours!

1:09:10.416 --> 1:09:12.708
-No, it's not my bag! It's not!
-Let me see that.

1:09:12.791 --> 1:09:14.875
- There's a luggage tag.
-No.

1:09:14.958 --> 1:09:16.125
My name is Meyer.

1:09:17.375 --> 1:09:19.083
I did... There's a tag. There's--

1:09:19.166 --> 1:09:20.833
- No, it's your bag.
-No...

1:09:21.250 --> 1:09:22.416
Dick McMahon.

1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:25.208
Yes, it's not my bag. I'm Elise Meyer.

1:09:32.833 --> 1:09:34.291
Mr. McMahon's no longer here.

1:09:34.375 --> 1:09:36.416
As I said, he's had a setback.

1:09:37.083 --> 1:09:38.500
What do you mean, he had a setback?

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:39.708
He was taken to the hospital.

1:09:39.791 --> 1:09:40.875
Wait, what?

1:09:41.625 --> 1:09:42.958
Where was his night nurse?

1:09:43.041 --> 1:09:44.833
There was supposed to be
somebody watching him.

1:09:44.916 --> 1:09:46.875
-His evening care was canceled.
-By whom?

1:09:46.958 --> 1:09:50.000
-His daughter requested the cancellation.
-No, there's been a huge mistake.

1:09:50.083 --> 1:09:51.708
Okay, all right, listen to me.

1:09:52.166 --> 1:09:53.750
What hospital has he been taken to?

1:09:53.833 --> 1:09:55.000
-Are you family?
-Yes.

1:09:55.083 --> 1:09:57.416
-Name and relationship?
-I'm his step-daughter.

1:09:58.250 --> 1:10:02.250
-I don't see any listing.
-Tell me what hospital they took him to!

1:10:02.916 --> 1:10:05.416
"Treat Austin Morrison,
ambassador-at-large,

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:07.458
BA, University of California, Berkeley.

1:10:07.541 --> 1:10:09.583
Graduate, National War College.

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.166
Commissioned second lieutenant, US Army.

1:10:12.250 --> 1:10:13.166
Married.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:17.833
Treat Austin Morrison, only son,
and after his sister's suicide,

1:10:17.916 --> 1:10:20.833
the only living child
of working-class parents.

1:10:20.916 --> 1:10:22.625
Married one Diane Waring.

1:10:23.875 --> 1:10:24.708
Widower.

1:10:25.791 --> 1:10:26.666
Young widower.

1:10:27.916 --> 1:10:29.583
The man who would later become

1:10:30.125 --> 1:10:34.958
America's man on the spot
in the world's hottest spots."

1:10:35.541 --> 1:10:38.541
It all depends on where you wanna locate
the beginning of your story.

1:10:38.625 --> 1:10:39.666
Any preference?

1:10:40.583 --> 1:10:42.416
You know, a lot of people
get some mystical kick

1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:44.708
out of dwelling on things
that happened 40...

1:10:45.458 --> 1:10:46.750
45 years ago.

1:10:47.458 --> 1:10:50.583
Sad little stories about being
misunderstood by your mother,

1:10:50.666 --> 1:10:52.500
being snubbed at school. I-I just...

1:10:53.541 --> 1:10:55.916
never found any use
for going over that stuff.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.625
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

1:10:57.708 --> 1:11:01.458
I don't think it's self-indulgent,
self-pitying, or any other damn thing.

1:11:01.541 --> 1:11:02.750
I just can't afford it.

1:11:02.833 --> 1:11:03.875
So I don't do it.

1:11:05.541 --> 1:11:07.666
Ah, it doesn't matter where it begins.

1:11:07.750 --> 1:11:08.916
You're right.

1:11:09.583 --> 1:11:10.666
What matters...

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.083
is what happens next.

1:11:13.666 --> 1:11:15.416
What's the next line going to read?

1:11:16.416 --> 1:11:18.333
No line. Berquist wants it deleted.

1:11:20.333 --> 1:11:22.375
Berquist is a...

1:11:23.041 --> 1:11:25.250
a legislative branch kind of man.

1:11:25.833 --> 1:11:27.958
The most he can ever hope for,
and he won't succeed,

1:11:28.041 --> 1:11:28.958
is the House of Reps.

1:11:29.041 --> 1:11:31.208
Not the Senate, because nobody likes him.

1:11:32.208 --> 1:11:35.208
All he'll ever be is one out of 435.

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:36.958
But you...

1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:42.000
You're an executive branch kind of man,
Treat.

1:11:43.875 --> 1:11:44.833
This office,

1:11:45.833 --> 1:11:48.583
or a bigger one a whole lot like it,
that's what I bet.

1:11:50.875 --> 1:11:52.625
Don't get in the way of Berquist's agenda.

1:11:54.583 --> 1:11:56.250
<i>If it doesn't serve you.</i>

1:11:57.125 --> 1:11:59.291
<i>I think Berkie's little side project...</i>

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.541
will serve you in a way
you have not yet foreseen.

1:12:03.708 --> 1:12:05.125
<i>Let him get his hands dirty.</i>

1:12:05.875 --> 1:12:09.333
- <i>He's aiming for one out of 435.</i>
-Very good.

1:12:10.833 --> 1:12:13.791
You're aiming for one out of one.

1:12:15.625 --> 1:12:16.875
Just remember...

1:12:18.291 --> 1:12:19.416
<i>You, me, Berquist...</i>

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:21.833
<i>we're all having the same dish.</i>

1:12:23.375 --> 1:12:24.708
But you'd be better off...

1:12:26.333 --> 1:12:27.333
using a spoon.

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:29.875
Scrape down the sides,

1:12:31.083 --> 1:12:32.083
no remainders.

1:12:33.833 --> 1:12:34.750
Nothing missed.

1:12:49.333 --> 1:12:50.833
At what hotel are you staying?

1:12:52.333 --> 1:12:53.291
Hotel?

1:12:53.375 --> 1:12:54.208
Yeah, Ramada,

1:12:54.291 --> 1:12:56.583
uh, Royale Caribe, InterCon...

1:12:56.666 --> 1:12:57.875
Ramada. Ramada.

1:13:01.375 --> 1:13:03.333
We had a real life, and now we don't.

1:13:03.416 --> 1:13:06.250
And just because I'm your daughter,
I'm supposed to like it, and I don't.

1:13:06.333 --> 1:13:07.750
-Cat--
- <i>No.</i>

1:13:08.833 --> 1:13:11.708
What exactly did you have in Malibu
that you don't have now?

1:13:12.333 --> 1:13:14.083
<i>You could open the door</i>
<i>and be at the beach,</i>

1:13:14.166 --> 1:13:16.625
in the Jacuzzi, or the tennis court.

1:13:17.041 --> 1:13:18.833
Anything else?

1:13:19.625 --> 1:13:22.083
The three cars. We had three cars.

1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:23.333
Fine.

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.916
A Jacuzzi, a tennis court, and three cars.
Is that your idea of a real life?

1:13:28.791 --> 1:13:29.625
No.

1:13:30.750 --> 1:13:33.500
<i>I'm sorry, sweetie, that wasn't...</i>
<i>That wasn't what I--</i>

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:36.708
My father. I had my father,
thank you very much.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:16.750
Checking in. McMahon, Elena.
I called earlier.

1:14:18.041 --> 1:14:19.375
Fresh cut coco!

1:14:19.666 --> 1:14:20.916
Fresh cut coco!

1:14:21.666 --> 1:14:22.750
Fresh cut coco!

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:25.625
Fresh cut coco!

1:14:26.166 --> 1:14:27.583
Fresh cut coco!

1:14:28.250 --> 1:14:29.541
Coco!

1:15:01.083 --> 1:15:02.083
Name tag?

1:15:02.166 --> 1:15:03.833
Happy Fourth of July. Name tag?

1:15:03.916 --> 1:15:05.000
Happy Fourth of July.

1:15:06.125 --> 1:15:07.291
Happy Fourth of July.

1:15:07.375 --> 1:15:10.666
Tomorrow morning is too late.
I need to speak to someone now.

1:15:10.750 --> 1:15:13.208
I-I need the passport immediately
so I can return to the States.

1:15:13.291 --> 1:15:16.750
Ma'am, I'm sorry. All offices are closed
today for the Fourth of July picnic.

1:15:17.666 --> 1:15:18.916
That's happening here, right?

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.666
-Yes, ma'am.
-So I can speak to someone now.

1:15:20.750 --> 1:15:22.541
No, ma'am,
there are no appointments today.

1:15:22.625 --> 1:15:26.833
But I wouldn't need an appointment to just
speak to someone at the picnic, right?

1:15:26.916 --> 1:15:29.666
Theoretically, ma'am,
but I can't let you in without a passport.

1:15:30.583 --> 1:15:31.875
Wh-- Just--

1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:33.750
Fine, fine.

1:16:13.791 --> 1:16:14.625
Thank you.

1:16:16.666 --> 1:16:18.125
Read any news today?

1:16:20.166 --> 1:16:21.000
Mmm...

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:26.041
Interesting scoop from a friendly agent
about a woman no one seems to know.

1:16:26.541 --> 1:16:29.750
No record of departing the States,
brief stay at a hotel in San José,

1:16:29.833 --> 1:16:32.916
false passport,
slipped past Antiguan Immigration.

1:16:33.333 --> 1:16:34.291
Fascinating.

1:16:35.791 --> 1:16:38.625
You ready to go on record
with any of that, Mr. Morrison?

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:39.875
Already have.

1:16:40.375 --> 1:16:42.791
Reporter by the name of Guerrero,
<i>Atlantic Post.</i>

1:16:43.375 --> 1:16:45.000
So you're connected.

1:16:45.541 --> 1:16:48.541
Well, my usual target's been out of touch,
but I hear she's--

1:16:48.625 --> 1:16:51.083
Is it normal for you to be a step behind?

1:16:53.333 --> 1:16:55.625
Wait for someone like me to be in a bind,

1:16:55.708 --> 1:17:00.000
squeeze a bit of distress into the math
so it feels urgent all of a sudden?

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.958
Something you can sink
your well-filed teeth into

1:17:04.041 --> 1:17:06.000
while a secretary forwards your calls?

1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:07.333
Could be.

1:17:08.333 --> 1:17:10.041
But if you had to pick someone
with a byline

1:17:10.125 --> 1:17:11.958
to drop classified intel with,

1:17:12.333 --> 1:17:13.458
wouldn't you pick you?

1:17:13.875 --> 1:17:16.083
Pennsylvania Avenue reporter
with a moral compass

1:17:16.166 --> 1:17:18.291
capable of pointing off the campaign trail

1:17:18.375 --> 1:17:21.166
and delivering a load of munitions
in South America?

1:17:21.250 --> 1:17:22.458
Must be worth reading.

1:17:22.708 --> 1:17:23.625
You think?

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:26.500
I didn't realize you quasi-spook types
did any reading.

1:17:26.583 --> 1:17:29.041
Not the brightest move,
showing up at the embassy.

1:17:31.083 --> 1:17:34.125
In a perfect world,
we'd make perfect choices.

1:17:34.583 --> 1:17:36.583
In the real world, we make real choices.

1:17:36.666 --> 1:17:38.250
It's not a zero-sum deal.

1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:41.333
Wasn't that your entire thesis
at last year's presentation

1:17:41.416 --> 1:17:43.375
to the Council on Foreign Relations?

1:17:43.666 --> 1:17:44.625
Did you cover that?

1:17:44.708 --> 1:17:48.041
I covered many interesting happenings
before my desk got frozen

1:17:48.125 --> 1:17:50.666
and I was relegated
to following around the circus,

1:17:50.750 --> 1:17:53.500
filing white propaganda
about all the elephant shit.

1:17:53.583 --> 1:17:55.958
Okay. Fair enough.

1:17:57.458 --> 1:17:58.291
Tell you what.

1:17:59.166 --> 1:18:00.041
Let's, uh...

1:18:00.958 --> 1:18:03.666
talk about other interesting happenings.

1:18:04.333 --> 1:18:06.666
<i>♪ From a loser ♪</i>

1:18:08.208 --> 1:18:09.875
<i>Dick McMahon's my father.</i>

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:15.750
<i>I took his place on a ghost plane</i>
<i>out of Fort Lauderdale on June 29th,</i>

1:18:15.833 --> 1:18:17.291
<i>1:20 in the morning.</i>

1:18:17.875 --> 1:18:19.750
A big-bellied Lockheed

1:18:19.833 --> 1:18:24.625
with enough guns, bullets, mines, and C-4
to take Managua.

1:18:28.541 --> 1:18:30.000
I hustled into the open.

1:18:31.458 --> 1:18:32.333
No payday.

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:34.875
No protection. No plan.

1:18:35.791 --> 1:18:37.625
Just a game no one let me in on.

1:18:38.375 --> 1:18:39.375
A secret war.

1:18:40.833 --> 1:18:44.166
Now I got a passport with a trick
built into it and no ticket home.

1:18:44.541 --> 1:18:45.541
That I know.

1:18:47.041 --> 1:18:49.166
What I don't know is
why you're still here.

1:18:54.166 --> 1:18:55.375
I came for the money.

1:18:56.250 --> 1:18:57.208
Stayed for the scoop.

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:58.916
Nice try.

1:19:03.916 --> 1:19:06.125
I came for my father,
stayed for the story.

1:19:08.208 --> 1:19:09.041
Closer.

1:19:13.916 --> 1:19:14.750
All right.

1:19:16.166 --> 1:19:17.583
I don't know why I came.

1:19:20.083 --> 1:19:20.958
But I stayed...

1:19:26.666 --> 1:19:29.666
I... stayed because I was losing focus.

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:34.375
I can feel it happening again.

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:35.833
I was...

1:19:35.916 --> 1:19:37.750
I was losing...

1:19:38.625 --> 1:19:41.500
momentum on Catherine, my daughter.

1:19:43.333 --> 1:19:44.750
And I knew that if I...

1:19:47.791 --> 1:19:50.500
walked away from this...

1:19:52.583 --> 1:19:53.750
I would just...

1:19:53.833 --> 1:19:56.708
I would just walk away from everything.
I would just...

1:20:00.458 --> 1:20:01.291
walk away.

1:20:08.833 --> 1:20:10.166
And all I want to know...

1:20:13.916 --> 1:20:15.250
is what you're doing here.

1:20:15.791 --> 1:20:17.458
What you're doing in the picture.

1:20:18.166 --> 1:20:19.000
What...

1:20:20.625 --> 1:20:22.875
if not stirring the pot?

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:31.666
<i>I thought you were the one.</i>

1:20:35.625 --> 1:20:37.458
I thought you were the one.

1:20:40.750 --> 1:20:43.125
I thought you were the one
they sent to kill me.

1:20:45.458 --> 1:20:46.416
I was ready.

1:20:53.208 --> 1:20:54.791
Diane had a scar like this.

1:20:57.875 --> 1:20:59.750
Then she just went.

1:21:02.916 --> 1:21:05.333
"The seal's wide spindrift gaze..."

1:21:07.250 --> 1:21:08.250
Something,

1:21:09.458 --> 1:21:11.791
"Galleons of Carib fire..."

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:13.125
Something, something.

1:21:13.583 --> 1:21:18.750
"The seal's wide spindrift gaze
towards paradise."

1:21:20.625 --> 1:21:21.916
Diane loved poetry.

1:21:23.833 --> 1:21:25.250
Alcestis.

1:21:26.291 --> 1:21:28.708
Back from the tunnel
and half in love with death.

1:21:32.250 --> 1:21:33.125
Tomorrow.

1:21:39.375 --> 1:21:40.333
Tomorrow what?

1:21:41.833 --> 1:21:42.875
Tomorrow we leave.

1:21:54.083 --> 1:21:55.916
- Come on. Give me this.
- What? No.

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.375
- This is the second time.
- Can you give it back?

1:21:58.458 --> 1:21:59.583
No. Come on.

1:21:59.666 --> 1:22:00.541
-Yes.
-No.

1:22:00.625 --> 1:22:02.541
-No.
-Listen, you can't sell here. No.

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:05.416
- Can I sell this?
- No, you can't sell this. No.

1:22:05.708 --> 1:22:09.291
-Chalatenango. Unbelievable.
-This is the second time.

1:22:09.375 --> 1:22:11.833
Shit, at least when you drive a stake
through a vampire's heart,

1:22:11.916 --> 1:22:13.500
-the fucker dies.
-Hey.

1:22:15.833 --> 1:22:16.708
See you tomorrow.

1:22:17.041 --> 1:22:18.958
- Good time, man
- Yeah, man.

1:22:19.041 --> 1:22:21.000
- Have a good night.
- Catch you later.

1:22:21.083 --> 1:22:21.958
Coming in tomorrow?

1:22:22.666 --> 1:22:24.458
-No.
-Give it back to me!

1:22:24.833 --> 1:22:25.833
Hey.

1:22:32.500 --> 1:22:34.208
-Elena!

1:22:55.583 --> 1:22:57.500
<i>Guests, please stay in your rooms...</i>

1:23:18.625 --> 1:23:21.875
Your countrymen aren't your countrymen.
There's no reason you should be here.

1:23:21.958 --> 1:23:24.958
But you can't tell me who you are
or how you know any of this.

1:23:25.041 --> 1:23:27.833
I think they just spelled the story out
in bullets, yes?

1:23:42.333 --> 1:23:44.833
Through there! Through there!
Make we pass!

1:23:44.916 --> 1:23:46.333
Make we pass!

1:23:47.083 --> 1:23:48.458
Hey, make we pass, brethren!

1:23:48.541 --> 1:23:50.416
Hey, make we pass, through there!

1:24:22.166 --> 1:24:23.291
Don't you see?

1:24:23.458 --> 1:24:26.250
They had to give your father
a figure big enough to lure him out.

1:24:26.958 --> 1:24:29.291
A magical million-dollar payday.

1:24:30.083 --> 1:24:31.750
He's a half-crazy old man
in a sick season.

1:24:31.833 --> 1:24:33.750
-My father is not--
- He's a man

1:24:33.833 --> 1:24:36.083
with a well-documented history

1:24:36.166 --> 1:24:38.958
of not caring
where his merchandise showed up.

1:24:39.833 --> 1:24:41.958
And so, he's a man very easily placed

1:24:42.041 --> 1:24:44.375
on the wrong side
of whatever was supposed to happen.

1:24:45.458 --> 1:24:47.125
"Gunrunner bleeds out in...

1:24:47.208 --> 1:24:49.333
in-- in terrorist attack
at Caribbean resort."

1:24:49.416 --> 1:24:50.250
So what?

1:24:50.875 --> 1:24:51.833
Who would miss him?

1:24:52.791 --> 1:24:53.666
Who would care?

1:24:54.833 --> 1:24:55.666
You?

1:24:57.791 --> 1:24:58.833
File closed.

1:24:59.791 --> 1:25:01.625
Finished and done.

1:25:03.541 --> 1:25:05.125
But you...

1:25:06.250 --> 1:25:07.416
You, Elena...

1:25:08.041 --> 1:25:09.375
But you showed up instead.

1:25:10.166 --> 1:25:12.708
And the file is still closing.

1:25:13.583 --> 1:25:17.958
All the little scraps and pieces
being assembled for the archive,

1:25:18.041 --> 1:25:19.125
to be forgotten.

1:25:19.583 --> 1:25:21.250
And yours is the last name on it.

1:25:21.333 --> 1:25:22.541
The passport, it--

1:25:22.625 --> 1:25:26.375
The only trick of the passport
was to keep you in play.

1:25:26.458 --> 1:25:29.250
You could have got on a plane
and left this place.

1:25:29.333 --> 1:25:32.041
No, the passport wouldn't be valid
for re-entry to the US,

1:25:32.125 --> 1:25:34.000
at which point you would have been taken.

1:25:34.083 --> 1:25:38.250
Rescued, rather, by the authorities,
which gave you more of a reason to leave.

1:25:39.875 --> 1:25:40.833
But no.

1:25:41.708 --> 1:25:43.416
You... you're still here.

1:25:46.750 --> 1:25:48.958
All I have left is this story, I admit it.

1:26:00.750 --> 1:26:01.666
Do you know who...

1:26:03.291 --> 1:26:05.291
the unreported casualties of...

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:06.916
of Vietnam were?

1:26:10.333 --> 1:26:11.333
The reporters...

1:26:12.875 --> 1:26:14.208
who couldn't move past it.

1:26:17.625 --> 1:26:18.666
Hey, Jones.

1:26:18.750 --> 1:26:19.708
All clear.

1:26:23.791 --> 1:26:26.000
You can stay here.
There's a phone across the square.

1:26:26.500 --> 1:26:27.708
One day, maybe two.

1:26:28.375 --> 1:26:30.750
I'll talk with my comrades
on getting us a boat.

1:26:32.666 --> 1:26:34.333
We are meant to survive
beyond our stories.

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:40.833
Guerrero speaking.

1:27:41.291 --> 1:27:42.541
-It's me.
- <i>Elena?</i>

1:27:42.625 --> 1:27:44.416
Call Catherine's father. Call Wynn.

1:27:44.750 --> 1:27:46.541
When you hang up with me, call him.

1:27:46.625 --> 1:27:48.958
Tell him to go to Catherine's school.
Tell him to go get her.

1:27:49.041 --> 1:27:52.625
Tell him not to send anybody.
Tell him he's gotta go himself, in person.

1:27:52.708 --> 1:27:55.375
And tell him I need him to keep her,
just until I get back.

1:27:55.458 --> 1:27:56.750
Done. Ellie...

1:27:58.291 --> 1:27:59.125
Dick is dead.

1:28:02.625 --> 1:28:03.458
I know.

1:28:03.541 --> 1:28:05.500
<i>They moved him</i>
<i>the night after you left.</i>

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:07.041
<i>The hospital wouldn't let me see him.</i>

1:28:07.125 --> 1:28:09.083
<i>And then I wasn't sure</i>
<i>if I should reach you</i>

1:28:09.166 --> 1:28:11.291
<i>or if reaching you</i>
<i>would expose you, but...</i>

1:28:11.375 --> 1:28:12.708
I'm sorry, Elena.

1:28:12.791 --> 1:28:13.625
But listen.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:19.291
My sources are telling me that there is
a French intelligence operative down there

1:28:19.375 --> 1:28:21.208
investigating the same thing that we are.

1:28:21.291 --> 1:28:23.000
<i>Okay? I don't have a name yet,</i>

1:28:23.083 --> 1:28:26.583
<i>but they could get you a special visa</i>
<i>and get you out of there.</i>

1:28:26.666 --> 1:28:29.083
These people
are starting to move faster.

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:31.750
The InterCon assassination attempt...

1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:34.916
-I was there.
- <i>I know.</i>

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.541
I know. Look, we're all over it down here.
But you should be safe for now.

1:28:38.958 --> 1:28:40.625
<i>They're beefing up the military presence.</i>

1:28:40.708 --> 1:28:43.375
No, the military was already there
in full force before the attempt.

1:28:43.458 --> 1:28:44.708
They knew it was coming.

1:28:45.125 --> 1:28:46.541
And I was meant to be there.

1:28:47.208 --> 1:28:49.125
Two birds, one stone. The file closes.

1:28:49.208 --> 1:28:50.041
<i>What?</i>

1:28:50.375 --> 1:28:52.750
The date on my bogus passport's
the same day Dick died.

1:28:52.833 --> 1:28:53.833
<i>Okay, calm down.</i>

1:28:54.541 --> 1:28:57.125
<i>Listen. Just stay where you are for now.</i>

1:28:57.208 --> 1:28:59.916
"Gunrunner bleeds out
in terrorist attack."

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:01.583
You showed up instead.

1:29:03.166 --> 1:29:04.875
<i>Hello?</i> <i>Elena?</i>

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.208
<i>Elena? Hello?</i>

1:29:08.291 --> 1:29:09.125
Elena!

1:29:10.541 --> 1:29:11.375
Elena!

1:29:16.416 --> 1:29:17.250
Elena!

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.500
There are two things
I need you to know right away.

1:29:35.083 --> 1:29:39.208
The first thing I need you to know
is that you get to go back to Malibu.

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.666
<i>Your dad's coming to pick you up.</i>

1:29:43.041 --> 1:29:45.875
<i>Do not go with anyone except your dad.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1:29:48.250 --> 1:29:50.250
<i>The second thing I need you to know...</i>

1:29:51.500 --> 1:29:52.750
<i>is that I love you.</i>

1:29:54.625 --> 1:29:56.166
<i>Sometimes... </i>

1:29:56.250 --> 1:29:59.083
<i>we argue and... about things, but I...</i>

1:30:01.250 --> 1:30:02.916
<i>I think you know...</i>

1:30:03.750 --> 1:30:07.208
<i>I only argue because</i>
<i>I want your life to be happy and good.</i>

1:30:08.416 --> 1:30:10.416
<i>Want you not to waste your time.</i>

1:30:11.291 --> 1:30:12.708
<i>Not to waste your talent.</i>

1:30:14.416 --> 1:30:17.375
<i>Not to let who you are get mixed up</i>

1:30:17.458 --> 1:30:19.916
<i>with anyone else's idea</i>
<i>of who you should be.</i>

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:23.083
<i>I know you're nodding.</i>

1:30:25.708 --> 1:30:27.958
<i>I love you the most. You're my Kit-Cat.</i>

1:30:36.541 --> 1:30:37.708
Okay.

1:30:38.125 --> 1:30:40.083
Everything's set. A car will take you.

1:30:40.375 --> 1:30:41.333
His name is Paul.

1:30:41.416 --> 1:30:42.458
<i>He's expecting you.</i>

1:30:43.125 --> 1:30:46.333
<i>No one will look for you there.</i>
<i>Now, I've been working with the consulate.</i>

1:30:46.416 --> 1:30:48.166
<i>We're gonna extract you</i>
<i>in the next few days. </i>

1:30:48.250 --> 1:30:51.416
<i>If anything happens, don't come to me.</i>
<i>It's too dangerous for you here.</i>

1:30:51.958 --> 1:30:53.625
<i>I'll come to you. Okay?</i>

1:30:56.208 --> 1:30:57.125
Can I help you?

1:30:57.666 --> 1:30:58.500
Hi.

1:30:58.875 --> 1:31:00.250
Uh, I'm Elise.

1:31:00.333 --> 1:31:01.250
Elise Meyer.

1:31:02.458 --> 1:31:05.375
Highly recommended Elise Meyer of Miami?

1:31:06.375 --> 1:31:08.708
Get up here.
Let's get you started already.

1:31:10.166 --> 1:31:13.625
Who wants to be sitting around
a bunch of jarheaded machos downtown

1:31:13.708 --> 1:31:16.166
when you can live
right on the edge of paradise?

1:31:16.750 --> 1:31:19.666
So, this job is not complicated at all.

1:31:20.416 --> 1:31:22.625
Each day, 10:00 a.m. sharp,

1:31:23.250 --> 1:31:24.250
routinely,

1:31:24.833 --> 1:31:27.791
pick us up fruit from the vendor
at Heritage Market.

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:29.291
I can get it from closer.

1:31:29.375 --> 1:31:31.625
No, Heritage Market. Thank you.

1:31:31.916 --> 1:31:34.000
Guavas from the stall near the entrance.

1:31:34.458 --> 1:31:37.750
Uh, pick us up newspapers
from the little woman two streets over.

1:31:37.833 --> 1:31:40.500
And get all the newspapers.
I like to be well-read.

1:31:41.041 --> 1:31:44.458
Plus, when guests come,
we want to be prepared.

1:31:45.166 --> 1:31:47.000
And, uh, let me see.

1:31:48.041 --> 1:31:49.083
We have a cook,

1:31:49.750 --> 1:31:50.583
Evelina,

1:31:50.666 --> 1:31:53.000
who comes every day at five
and handles supper,

1:31:53.083 --> 1:31:54.583
so you don't need to worry about that.

1:31:54.666 --> 1:31:55.750
But just, you know...

1:31:57.125 --> 1:31:58.208
tidy things.

1:32:00.125 --> 1:32:01.333
I could wipe the chairs.

1:32:02.791 --> 1:32:04.041
They said you were sharp.

1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.666
<i>♪ I ain't never seen a man ♪</i>

1:32:09.250 --> 1:32:11.083
<i>♪ Do the things that... ♪</i>

1:32:11.166 --> 1:32:12.166
Do you know this?

1:32:13.375 --> 1:32:16.750
Gary Geld, composer.
Peter Udell and Ossie Davis did the book.

1:32:16.833 --> 1:32:17.666
It's delicious.

1:32:17.750 --> 1:32:19.833
Melba Moore version was my favorite.

1:32:19.916 --> 1:32:23.083
Melba Moore was criminally underrated.

1:32:23.541 --> 1:32:24.666
<i>Pas de </i>critics.

1:32:25.791 --> 1:32:29.291
So anyway, all that should take you
through 2:00 p.m. every day.

1:32:30.458 --> 1:32:31.708
And no shortcuts.

1:32:31.958 --> 1:32:33.291
<i>Pas de</i> shortcuts.

1:32:34.416 --> 1:32:36.541
After that, your day is your own.

1:32:37.750 --> 1:32:38.916
Isn't this lovely?

1:32:40.083 --> 1:32:42.166
What could be lovelier?

1:32:44.625 --> 1:32:45.583
Take the day.

1:32:46.208 --> 1:32:47.208
Get settled in.

1:32:48.125 --> 1:32:48.958
Oh, and, uh...

1:32:49.333 --> 1:32:50.791
be kind to the generator.

1:32:50.875 --> 1:32:53.083
We need lights, but not every day.

1:32:53.708 --> 1:32:57.083
I only do the petrol run once a week
and I want to keep it that way.

1:33:22.958 --> 1:33:25.041
Elise, happy hour!

1:33:25.125 --> 1:33:25.958
Coming!

1:33:26.666 --> 1:33:28.458
Happy, happy hour.

1:33:44.458 --> 1:33:45.833
<i>It was complicated.</i>

1:33:45.916 --> 1:33:47.458
<i>I could tell you stories.</i>

1:33:47.541 --> 1:33:50.666
- No.
-I'm not gonna say any names, but...

1:33:51.166 --> 1:33:52.583
if I did tell you the names,

1:33:52.666 --> 1:33:54.958
-you'd recognize every single one of them.

1:33:56.791 --> 1:33:59.375
And then, there was Haiti,

1:34:00.125 --> 1:34:01.375
which I adored.

1:34:02.083 --> 1:34:04.291
I was mostly single there, of course.

1:34:04.958 --> 1:34:06.500
Just a man about town.

1:34:08.458 --> 1:34:10.291
I ran the first, and...

1:34:11.166 --> 1:34:13.625
for all I care to know, the only

1:34:13.708 --> 1:34:18.333
first-rate gay bathhouse
in all of Port-au-Prince.

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:20.416
And again, no names,

1:34:21.250 --> 1:34:25.291
but my patrons were some of the most
major operators on Wall Street,

1:34:25.375 --> 1:34:28.041
the hottest of the hot, motion picture,

1:34:28.750 --> 1:34:30.875
and agents and executives.

1:34:30.958 --> 1:34:32.041
I mean, the biggest.

1:34:33.791 --> 1:34:35.708
Of all the places, you know?

1:34:38.583 --> 1:34:39.833
I feel like that...

1:34:41.041 --> 1:34:42.916
could have been <i>the</i> place.

1:34:45.625 --> 1:34:47.041
But then I got scared away

1:34:47.125 --> 1:34:50.083
when dead chickens
started showing up on my gate.

1:34:50.416 --> 1:34:53.083
I mean, I may not be
the smartest Nellie on the block,

1:34:53.166 --> 1:34:55.458
but, hey, when I see a dead chicken,

1:34:55.541 --> 1:34:57.250
I know what it means.

1:34:57.875 --> 1:34:59.000
I know how to take a hint.

1:34:59.083 --> 1:35:00.791
<i>Pas de poulet.</i>

1:35:01.250 --> 1:35:02.375
<i>Pas de</i> voodoo.

1:35:03.875 --> 1:35:06.125
<i>Pas de</i> Port-au-Prince,

1:35:06.666 --> 1:35:08.000
so I ended up here.

1:35:09.958 --> 1:35:11.375
Bob set me up.

1:35:14.791 --> 1:35:16.333
We did a great business.

1:35:16.625 --> 1:35:19.000
Every room was filled
every single weekend.

1:35:19.791 --> 1:35:23.958
And for a while, we ran a beautiful trade
with the European set.

1:35:24.958 --> 1:35:27.875
But then, a few neighbor-island
coups and bombings later,

1:35:27.958 --> 1:35:30.625
it trickled down to the backpackers,
and then...

1:35:31.458 --> 1:35:35.250
several State Department warnings later,
and we were down to this.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:39.291
So, why did you stay?

1:35:40.750 --> 1:35:42.000
Why are you still here?

1:35:45.916 --> 1:35:47.708
I could ask you the same question.

1:35:50.083 --> 1:35:51.416
But me, I...

1:35:52.583 --> 1:35:55.083
I guess I stayed because I have a very,

1:35:56.416 --> 1:35:59.041
very high tolerance for pleasure.

1:36:40.708 --> 1:36:43.208
Tell Evelina to set the table
for three tonight.

1:36:43.625 --> 1:36:44.875
My friend is coming.

1:36:45.166 --> 1:36:46.041
Who's that?

1:36:46.625 --> 1:36:49.041
My friend. The one I told you about?

1:36:49.750 --> 1:36:50.583
Bob?

1:36:51.500 --> 1:36:52.333
No.

1:36:53.041 --> 1:36:54.000
The other friend.

1:37:03.291 --> 1:37:05.541
Be a dear, fetch me a refill.

1:37:16.250 --> 1:37:18.208
I mean,
it's not like the vacancy sign

1:37:18.291 --> 1:37:20.875
isn't burning a hole
in my electric bill or anything.

1:37:21.291 --> 1:37:25.125
Like I keep telling you,
there's people I know who can help you.

1:37:25.208 --> 1:37:27.500
People we've met here in the past.

1:37:28.166 --> 1:37:29.916
I say, sure, take a room.

1:37:30.625 --> 1:37:32.750
Fill it with whatever on earth you want.

1:37:34.208 --> 1:37:35.083
Rum punch?

1:37:35.791 --> 1:37:37.458
Be a dear, leave it on the side, Elena.

1:37:39.166 --> 1:37:41.333
Move it in, move it out, who cares?

1:37:42.666 --> 1:37:43.708
Just cut me in.

1:37:44.916 --> 1:37:49.416
Drop me a bit of this Colombian jet fuel
from weekend to weekend and I'll be sweet.

1:37:50.125 --> 1:37:52.625
We've done this before.
I told you...

1:37:56.916 --> 1:37:58.750
...here in the past.

1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.833
I can create your future for you.

1:38:24.375 --> 1:38:25.250
Elise!

1:38:30.250 --> 1:38:31.541
Elise!

1:38:34.625 --> 1:38:35.583
Oh, fuck it.

1:38:35.958 --> 1:38:37.000
Evelina!

1:39:02.208 --> 1:39:04.125
Wipe the chairs, Elise.

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.250
<i>If anything happens, don't come</i>
<i>to me. It's not safe for you here anymore.</i>

1:39:11.333 --> 1:39:12.291
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

1:39:58.166 --> 1:39:59.541
Does she know something?

1:40:00.291 --> 1:40:03.333
-Did you tell her something?
- Of course I didn't tell her.

1:40:04.416 --> 1:40:05.666
Don't do it the hard way.

1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.375
You could ride the cattle
right through the fence.

1:40:12.250 --> 1:40:15.166
<i>...driving the cattle</i>
<i>through the goddamn fence.</i>

1:40:15.250 --> 1:40:17.750
You just missed my partner.
You know him, Epperson.

1:40:18.125 --> 1:40:20.958
- <i>I don't know him.</i>
- <i>Yeah, you do. You remember.</i>

1:40:21.041 --> 1:40:22.083
Hey, Maxie.

1:40:22.166 --> 1:40:25.500
-Make with the grill and lay on some chow.
-Hey, Ellie.

1:40:26.041 --> 1:40:28.458
The sparks won't burn you because...

1:40:28.916 --> 1:40:29.750
they're cold.

1:40:31.958 --> 1:40:34.083
<i>Epperson. Like he doesn't exist.</i>

1:40:34.166 --> 1:40:37.000
<i>-A guy named Bob Weir did come up.</i>

1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:39.000
Bob set me up.

1:40:39.083 --> 1:40:40.750
<i>When he does show up,</i>

1:40:40.833 --> 1:40:43.458
<i>it's usually the end of something,</i>
<i>not the beginning.</i>

1:40:46.416 --> 1:40:47.291
Elise?

1:40:48.375 --> 1:40:49.250
Is that you?

1:40:54.708 --> 1:40:56.166
She'll be back up later.

1:41:00.166 --> 1:41:01.000
He's there.

1:41:01.833 --> 1:41:02.666
Bob Weir.

1:41:02.750 --> 1:41:04.083
Oh, fuck. Come in.

1:41:10.791 --> 1:41:13.333
<i>Out beyond the ocean.</i>

1:41:13.666 --> 1:41:17.833
<i>All salt-heavy and thick with fish.</i>

1:41:18.458 --> 1:41:19.791
What do think's out there?

1:41:21.125 --> 1:41:23.708
Suppose there's nothing out there,
actually.

1:41:24.041 --> 1:41:24.875
No there.

1:41:28.083 --> 1:41:30.166
Plane will be there
at eight o'clock tomorrow.

1:41:30.250 --> 1:41:33.625
An unmarked will take you to the airstrip.
It's ours. You'll be safe.

1:41:33.708 --> 1:41:36.791
I'm gonna stay a few days till everything
levels out, clear some smoke.

1:41:36.875 --> 1:41:40.458
Says the secret agent man
as he walks into the fire.

1:41:40.958 --> 1:41:42.666
<i>Easy Rider</i> of the geopolitic,

1:41:42.750 --> 1:41:44.458
too cool for the press pool.

1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:46.916
Stop. True reporter.

1:41:48.833 --> 1:41:49.750
Pure spin.

1:41:50.666 --> 1:41:53.083
Pick you up at the cove
by the Surfrider at 6:00.

1:41:53.416 --> 1:41:55.041
Make sure you have your notes
and the film.

1:41:55.125 --> 1:41:56.708
Otherwise it's all fucked anyway.

1:41:57.708 --> 1:41:59.958
Unless you think they already found them
and it's too late.

1:42:00.291 --> 1:42:01.375
No, I stashed them.

1:42:02.875 --> 1:42:03.708
Good.

1:42:06.625 --> 1:42:08.833
<i>I'll try to be home</i>
<i>before school starts.</i>

1:42:08.916 --> 1:42:10.083
<i>Home where?</i>

1:42:11.708 --> 1:42:13.458
<i>Home wherever you are, Cat.</i>

1:42:15.416 --> 1:42:17.708
<i>I'll call you tomorrow</i>
<i>before I get on the plane.</i>

1:42:18.666 --> 1:42:20.041
Tomorrow when?

1:42:21.708 --> 1:42:23.375
<i>Probably three o'clock your time.</i>

1:42:23.458 --> 1:42:24.375
<i>I'll be there.</i>

1:42:25.625 --> 1:42:26.541
<i>Promise?</i>

1:42:28.458 --> 1:42:29.333
<i>Okay.</i>

1:42:30.208 --> 1:42:31.083
<i>I promise.</i>

1:42:31.166 --> 1:42:32.583
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

1:43:45.083 --> 1:43:47.958
<i>...to make a call,</i>
<i>please hang up and try again.</i>

1:43:48.041 --> 1:43:51.375
<i>If you need help, hang up,</i>
<i>and then dial your operator.</i>

1:43:52.791 --> 1:43:55.833
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>
<i>please hang up and try again.</i>

1:43:56.208 --> 1:43:59.500
<i>If you need help, hang up,</i>
<i>and then dial your operator.</i>

1:44:01.625 --> 1:44:04.666
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>
<i>please hang up and try again.</i>

1:44:18.250 --> 1:44:20.500
<i>Some real things</i>
<i>have happened lately.</i>

1:44:24.083 --> 1:44:25.916
<i>First, I wanted to know who.</i>

1:44:27.083 --> 1:44:28.958
<i>Who chose money over life?</i>

1:44:29.541 --> 1:44:31.875
<i>Steel and lead over blood and spirit?</i>

1:44:33.916 --> 1:44:35.041
<i>Who the war pig?</i>

1:44:35.791 --> 1:44:36.958
<i>Who the profiteer?</i>

1:44:37.750 --> 1:44:40.041
<i>Who the cold heart, the vapid soul?</i>

1:44:40.125 --> 1:44:41.125
Elena!

1:44:42.166 --> 1:44:43.250
<i>And second...</i>

1:44:47.958 --> 1:44:50.666
<i>Second, I wanted to know why.</i>

1:44:52.416 --> 1:44:53.291
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

1:44:53.833 --> 1:44:55.000
Tomorrow what?

1:44:55.083 --> 1:44:56.208
Tomorrow we leave.

1:45:01.833 --> 1:45:03.791
<i>The suspect then wheeled on me,</i>

1:45:04.208 --> 1:45:05.541
pulling a firearm...

1:45:07.416 --> 1:45:08.833
wounding me in the shoulder.

1:45:10.958 --> 1:45:12.166
I returned fire...

1:45:13.708 --> 1:45:14.875
in course, killing her.

1:45:15.833 --> 1:45:17.625
I think...

1:45:19.208 --> 1:45:20.833
I think she knew she was caught.

1:45:23.250 --> 1:45:24.083
You know...

1:45:25.541 --> 1:45:27.083
you think you have it covered,

1:45:28.208 --> 1:45:30.833
and find out you don't have it covered
worth a goddamn.

1:45:33.333 --> 1:45:34.833
It added all up, but...

1:45:36.166 --> 1:45:37.375
it won't bring her back.

1:45:40.875 --> 1:45:42.708
Elise Meyer.

1:45:42.791 --> 1:45:44.125
Elena Janklow.

1:45:44.583 --> 1:45:45.875
Elena McMahon.

1:45:46.500 --> 1:45:48.125
Alleged assassin.

1:45:48.666 --> 1:45:49.875
Reporter.

1:45:50.458 --> 1:45:52.083
American.

1:45:52.166 --> 1:45:54.166
Mother. Daughter.

1:45:55.250 --> 1:45:57.375
Sandinista sympathizer.

1:45:58.208 --> 1:46:02.750
Unfortunately,
our initial attempt at interception...

1:46:02.833 --> 1:46:04.375
This way, please.

1:46:04.458 --> 1:46:05.708
<i>...was unsuccessful.</i>

1:46:14.666 --> 1:46:17.375
<i>Some would say</i>
<i>she was waiting for a payday.</i>

1:46:18.958 --> 1:46:21.750
<i>Some would say</i>
<i>she was caught in the glare.</i>

1:46:24.625 --> 1:46:27.250
<i>I think Elena McMahon</i>
<i>got caught in the glare.</i>

1:46:30.083 --> 1:46:31.500
<i>The water was over her head.</i>

1:46:44.750 --> 1:46:48.000
I think she realized
what she had been set up to do

1:46:48.083 --> 1:46:49.750
only in however many seconds there were

1:46:49.833 --> 1:46:52.833
between the time
she registered Morrison on the bluff...

1:46:55.291 --> 1:46:57.333
<i>and when he pulled the trigger.</i>

1:47:00.583 --> 1:47:01.750
Why'd she do it?

1:47:02.625 --> 1:47:05.125
I don't have an answer
for that kind of tragedy.

1:47:07.541 --> 1:47:09.916
The truth is,
it's just a hell of a bad outcome.

1:47:12.625 --> 1:47:14.791
The last outcome
you would ever have wanted.

1:47:24.166 --> 1:47:26.416
<i>Some real things</i>
<i>have happened lately.</i>

1:47:27.541 --> 1:47:30.416
<i>But we were moving fast.</i>

1:47:31.708 --> 1:47:33.125
<i>We were traveling light.</i>

1:47:34.500 --> 1:47:35.541
<i>We were younger.</i>

1:47:36.500 --> 1:47:37.541
<i>I was younger.</i>

1:47:39.875 --> 1:47:40.875
<i>"All part of...</i>

1:47:41.875 --> 1:47:44.750
<i>history's rough draft," we used to say.</i>

1:47:46.458 --> 1:47:47.750
<i>History's footnote.</i>

1:47:49.833 --> 1:47:50.666
<i>And yet...</i>
