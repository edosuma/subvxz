00:23.500 --> 00:25.800
Excuse me, Cam.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.300
Oh, hello, Frasier.
Still driving a sedan?

00:29.600 --> 00:32.500
Yes, well, at least mine
fits in the allotted space.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.100
Unlike this new behemoth
you're driving.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.700
Well, actually it's the Behemoth XL.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.500
Well, use care getting out.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.500
FRASIER: Come back here.
You know very well I can't get out!

00:44.100 --> 00:46.200
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.900
Let me see what I can do about that.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.700
[CHOKING]

00:51.500 --> 00:52.600
Oh!

00:52.900 --> 00:54.700
Tough break.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.500
If I move,
I'll be over the line on the other side.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.300
But you're over the line on this side.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.600
Actually, if you were standing out here,
you would see

01:01.900 --> 01:05.200
that I am just on the line,
which, as we both know, is in.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.300
If I were standing out there we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.700
I wish I could help.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.400
Maybe next time you'll think twice

01:11.700 --> 01:14.400
before calling the police
when I have a party.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.300
What makes you think it was me?

01:16.600 --> 01:18.600
You're the only one in the building
I didn't invite.

Thanks again for the ride, Roz.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.000
ROZ:
Sure, no problem.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.500
Isn't this a lot of stuff
for just one night?

02:07.600 --> 02:08.699
Oh, it's not for one night.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.700
Niles and I have decided to keep
a few things at each other's houses.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You know, save
running back and forth.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.400
There you are.
I thought I heard you come in.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.300
Oh, hey, Roz.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.300
- Niles.
- My God, what is all that?

02:23.200 --> 02:25.800
Oh, it's the stuff
I'm gonna be keeping at your place.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.100
Since you're here,
do you mind giving me a ride?

02:28.300 --> 02:29.500
What's wrong with your car?

02:29.600 --> 02:33.000
I had to lend it to Frasier.
His is drying out. Long story.

02:33.900 --> 02:37.100
Well, uh, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to get all that stuff in my car.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.400
Oh, once we get the rest of Daphne's
stuff out, there'll be plenty of room.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
These are all my things.

02:43.900 --> 02:49.700
Oh. Well, uh, I guess I could do
without this dressing gown.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.200
Oh, but what if I'm wearing
dark pyjamas? Eh.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.200
Yeah, that would be all crazy.

02:56.500 --> 03:00.300
Niles, maybe if I take the seat out
of my car, I can cram all this stuff in.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.700
Yeah, that might work,
but let's not move anything

03:02.900 --> 03:05.800
until Niles and I have
a little discussion about this.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Um...

03:07.300 --> 03:09.700
Well, I definitely know
I'm gonna need this one.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.800
- Oh. I'll take it down.
- Okay, thanks.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.500
- Niles, what do you have in here?
- Um, ties.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.900
Something wrong?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.800
Where are we supposed
to put all this?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.200
I cleared out two drawers.
This will fill two closets.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.200
Well, we said we'd both bring whatever
we needed for any eventuality.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.300
Isn't there anything
you can leave behind?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.600
I don't see how. I have formal,
semi-formal, dishabille,

03:32.800 --> 03:34.300
wet weather, cold weather, cloudy.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.400
I mean, if there's something here
you find excessive, jump right in.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.200
I just don't have the space, and I don't
see your brother giving up any of his.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.300
Maybe this isn't gonna work.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.500
I'm sorry. I thought
this would make things easier.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.500
- And it would if I had more room.
- Hmm.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.100
You're right.
That was thoughtless of me.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.300
Guess I'm just used to rattling
around here all by myself.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.000
Sometimes I think this is
too much space for just one person.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.000
- You know...
- Yes?

04:06.200 --> 04:09.400
- You could live here.
- Are you asking me?

04:09.800 --> 04:13.300
- Would you like to?
- Would you like me to?

04:14.200 --> 04:17.399
- Yeah.
- Then I will.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.100
Okay.

04:20.899 --> 04:22.100
Wow.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.600
[LAUGHING]

04:23.900 --> 04:25.800
- That was a big thing.
- I'll say.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.200
- I'm gonna live in your apartment.
- Our apartment.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.500
Our apartment. Oh, my,
I'm gonna have to practise saying that.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.000
"Let's go back to our apartment."

04:33.300 --> 04:35.000
Yeah. "Why don't we meet
at our apartment?"

04:35.300 --> 04:37.200
"Oh, my, our apartment
has a gas leak."

04:37.400 --> 04:39.700
"Oh, no, our apartment's
going to explode!"

04:40.100 --> 04:42.400
"Oh, no, there goes our apartment!"

04:44.600 --> 04:46.900
- So, what else we taking?
DAPHNE: Good news, Roz.

04:47.600 --> 04:52.000
- Niles and I are moving in together.
- Oh, hey, that's great news.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.700
So I didn't have to strip two bolts

04:53.900 --> 04:56.400
and grease up my shirt
moving the seat out after all.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.000
Nope. And you didn't need to take
Niles' ties down either.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.100
No, no, no, but I will get the ties.
You stay here in our apartment.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.400
- Our apartment. Our living room.
- Yes.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.100
- Our fireplace. Yeah.
- Our kitchen.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.600
- Our bedroom.
- Our bedroom.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.900
I'll get the ties.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.200
You should've been
at the condo board meeting.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.300
You missed all the excitement.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.100
Now, don't tell me. People argued
about some dumb building policy

05:31.500 --> 05:33.900
and then you all had cookies.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
Not this time.

05:36.700 --> 05:41.000
I gave the greatest speech
of my condo-board career.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.800
Which led to a vote, which led to the
ruling that Cam Winston

05:44.000 --> 05:48.700
must now park that SUV monstrosity
of his in the sub-basement.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.200
Then we had cookies.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.300
My mistake.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.100
- How did Cam take it?
- He was livid, thank you.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.400
[LAUGHING]

05:57.600 --> 06:00.400
But I pointed out that the emissions
from his over-sized vehicle

06:00.700 --> 06:02.900
endangered the health of anyone
passing through the lobby

06:03.200 --> 06:04.600
and I won the day.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.000
People bought that?

06:06.200 --> 06:09.500
Dad, I am an orator, hmm?

06:10.400 --> 06:14.500
It is not only that which is said,
but the passion with which it is said.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.800
You're saying it now
and it just sounds like a lot of hooey.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.100
[DOORBELL RINGS]

06:19.400 --> 06:21.700
That's because
I'm not orating right now.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.100
Oh, just go back to your paper.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
Ah.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.400
Good afternoon again, Cam.

06:30.700 --> 06:34.000
Listen, Crane, you may
have bamboozled the condo board,

06:34.300 --> 06:35.900
but we both know
you just want more room

06:36.200 --> 06:39.200
to swing your fat ass into that BMW.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
Cam, if there is any benefit to me,

06:43.900 --> 06:46.300
it is the cleaner air
which we will all now breathe.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.400
Oh, get off your high horse.
You do your share of polluting

06:49.800 --> 06:53.200
with that substitute for masculinity
you're driving.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.300
If mine's a substitute for masculinity,
then what is yours?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.000
Bigger.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.500
Ha!

07:01.200 --> 07:03.100
That wasn't funny.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.400
I'm sorry, Cam,
but I believe the issue is closed.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.000
It was voted on by the majority

07:08.100 --> 07:10.200
in the spirit of the great democracy
that is America.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.500
I believe that is check and mate.
Good day.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.400
Boo-hoo, Cam. No more blocking
my driver's-side door.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.600
You think that's smart, ticking off
the guy who lives right above us?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.000
Dad, we are protected
by this building's constitution.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.400
Believe me, I will have Cam cited
for a noise violation

07:26.600 --> 07:29.600
if he so much as drops a hint.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.900
- Hi.

Hello? Oh, Mum.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I've been meaning to call,

08:00.600 --> 08:03.000
but Dr. Crane yells at me
whenever I phone long distance.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.200
- I do not.
- Let her say whatever she needs to.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.700
Yeah, and poor old Mr. Crane.
He's so feeble

08:08.000 --> 08:09.700
he can't even make it to the loo
by himself.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.600
- Hey!
[MOUTHS] <i>Sorry.</i>

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Can you believe it?

08:14.800 --> 08:18.400
I am actually going to be living under
the same roof with the woman I adore.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.000
If you'd told me that this was gonna
happen, I'd have said you were crazy.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.500
I know exactly how you feel.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.200
You know, I used to think that Cam
Winston's SUV was immovable.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.300
And now look at me.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.400
Well, I think this calls
for a celebration.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.500
- How about some champagne?
- Oh, stay there, I'll get the Dom.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.400
Well, it's the end of an era.

08:40.799 --> 08:45.300
Yeah. It's been the three of us
under this roof for nine years.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.400
Do you remember when Daphne
first came here?

08:48.600 --> 08:49.900
She was so young and naïve.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
I didn't think she'd last a week.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.600
Yet she somehow managed
to forge a relationship

08:54.800 --> 09:00.000
with a blustery psychiatrist
and a crotchety old man.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And with me too.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.800
Yes, Dad, with you too.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.200
Well, we knew
she wouldn't be around forever,

09:13.400 --> 09:16.400
but I never would've guessed
she'd end up with Niles.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.700
I know.

09:17.900 --> 09:22.500
He's come so far
since the dark days of Maris and Mel.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.200
Well, I guess from now on
it's just you and I.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.400
You and me, Dad.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.000
This is gonna be great.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.000
- So, Niles, when is moving day?
- As soon as possible.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.300
Once we made the decision,
neither of us wants to waste a second.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.200
- Well, the move's off.
- What?

09:42.600 --> 09:45.100
Just temporarily.
My parents are coming for a visit.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.900
Well, what does that have to do
with us living together?

09:48.200 --> 09:51.300
Well, I just think, with all the confusion
there is involved with a move,

09:51.500 --> 09:53.200
it's best if we wait
till after they leave.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.800
Or we could call a mover

09:55.100 --> 09:57.000
and have your stuff
over at my place by tomorrow.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.700
And your parents could stay with us.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.100
Oh, Niles, that is so sweet.
I know they'll love that.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.800
But I think I should wait
until after their visit to move.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.000
- Daphne, what's going on?
- Nothing.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.200
I just think... Well, why rush?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.500
Moving is something to be enjoyed.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.700
So just to clarify,
you're going to stay here,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.700
but your parents
are going to stay with me?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.400
I'm so glad you understand.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.600
[MOUTHS]
<i>What happened?</i>

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
I hope Daphne's not having trouble
with their luggage.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.800
I should have gone with her
to the airport.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.100
What kind of impression
does it make that I didn't go?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.700
- She didn't want you to go with her.
- What does that say?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.300
FRASIER:
Niles, will you relax?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.300
You always
make a good first impression.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.700
Second. The first I made
when I kidnapped their daughter

10:47.000 --> 10:48.200
from her wedding.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.300
Oh, God,
where are my crab croquettes?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.300
- In the warming oven.
- They'll dry out.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.000
- I'll serve them.
NILES: They'll get cold.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.400
Oh! I don't know. I don't know.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
[DOORBELL RINGS]

10:58.900 --> 11:00.000
Now! Now! Crab croquettes!

11:00.200 --> 11:02.700
Dad, Dad, it's showtime.
Keep your wits about you.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.800
Right, I'll just follow your lead.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.700
Oh, Mrs. Moon. Welcome. Come in.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
- Mum, you remember Niles?
- Of course.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.700
You know, I was quite cross with you

11:17.000 --> 11:19.600
when you stole my daughter
away from that rich lawyer,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.900
but from the looks of this place,
you do all right.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.400
NILES:
Oh. Heh.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.000
Uh, nice to see you again, Mrs. Moon.
Martin Crane.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.800
Oh, of course.

11:29.100 --> 11:32.300
You're the one who's kind enough
to keep my daughter employed.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.900
It's not kindness.
She does a great job.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.400
Well, she does what she can
with what God gave her.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.000
Um, where's Mr. Moon?

11:42.200 --> 11:44.700
Oh. Well, actually there's been
a slight change of plans.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.000
Hello, hello.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.100
- Simon!
- Simon?

11:49.300 --> 11:52.500
MARTIN: Buddy, how you doing?
- Well, I'm thirsty for a start.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.500
Then let's care of that.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.900
Oh, I could use a tiny nip
of something myself.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.400
What is your brother doing here?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.700
My dad couldn't make it,
so Mum brought him instead.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.200
Why? Why didn't your dad come?

12:05.400 --> 12:08.000
I don't know.
I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.300
- Dad doesn't like to travel.
- Why not?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.800
You know, that flight
made my feet swell up

12:13.100 --> 12:15.200
like a couple of Christmas hams.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.400
Oh, Simon, give them a rub.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.400
I rubbed them halfway
across the Atlantic.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.100
Hey, Fras, I got an idea.
Why doesn't Simon stay with us?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.800
Oh, oh.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.900
That's very kind of you, Marty.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.700
Yes, well, it is, except it's...

12:30.000 --> 12:33.700
Uh, well, I think
there'll be more room here at Niles'.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.700
Oh. Yes, although Frasier's apartment
is, uh, closer to a pizza restaurant.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.500
Yes, but Niles'
is closer to a liquor mart.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.300
Now, now, now, I don't want you boys
fighting over me.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.500
Dad, how many channels
does that satellite of yours get?

12:48.800 --> 12:51.200
- Five hundred.
- We have a winner.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.300
Uh, Mum, your room's gonna be
down that hallway on the left

12:56.700 --> 12:57.800
if you'd like to freshen up.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.500
Oh, look who's the lady of the house.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.900
Spend a lot of time here, do you?

13:03.100 --> 13:06.700
Are you kidding?
She probably had it off in every room.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.200
Simon Moon, bite your tongue.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.600
My baby girl's a virgin.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.600
Isn't that so, Daphne?

13:15.600 --> 13:16.700
Of course, Mum.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.700
It's you who'll have your leg
over any filth that moves.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.500
I don't care if they're moving.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
[GERTRUDE LAUGHING]

13:26.900 --> 13:29.600
Um, Daphne, could I see you in
the kitchen for just a sec? Excuse us.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.100
Should we stop at the supermarket
on the way home?

13:32.400 --> 13:36.700
I'm very fond of those ham-and-cheese
Hot Pockets that you had last year.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.300
Oh, I keep those stocked.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.000
Everything's just like you remember.

13:40.200 --> 13:46.000
Well, there has been one small
change. The liquor cabinet has a lock.

13:46.300 --> 13:50.000
Yeah. Well, my new moped
had a lock too. Ha-ha!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.800
My mother is very old-fashioned.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.500
But if she thinks you're a virgin,

13:56.800 --> 13:59.100
how are you going to explain
our plan to live together?

13:59.300 --> 14:02.500
I wonder how important it is
that she ever finds out.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.800
What are you saying?
We're just not gonna tell her?

14:05.100 --> 14:07.000
Well, I can still get my mail
at your brother's,

14:07.100 --> 14:09.700
and my phone messages.
And we can screen calls here.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.500
That's ridiculous. We're adults.
We're not gonna sneak around.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.900
Well, it's not forever.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.600
Mum's getting on in years,
and she smokes like a chimney.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.200
[OVEN DINGS]

14:20.300 --> 14:23.500
Your mother really thinks
you're still a virgin?

14:23.800 --> 14:28.200
Niles, who cares what Mum thinks?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.700
- Daphne.
- Fresh.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.100
Hey, you better not let Frasier see you
wipe your hands on the couch.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.500
He's mad enough that you ate
that stuff he puts on his face.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.700
I'm telling you, it was marmalade.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.900
Do you mind? Feet off the furniture.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.500
You heard, Eddie. Get off. Go on.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.700
- He's talking to you.
- Ooh!

15:01.100 --> 15:05.500
Daphne, dear, I've finally figured out
what's wrong with your outfit.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.300
It's made for a smaller woman.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.400
Now, hold on. I was there
when she picked out that outfit.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.500
- I think it's abso...
ROZ: Thanks for dinner.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.100
That was really great.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.500
You're welcome.
Uh, well, the best is still ahead.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.000
Wait till you taste the apple crisp
that Daphne made for dessert.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.400
ROZ:
Mm.

15:23.600 --> 15:28.000
Is that that delicious apple thing
with the crispy bits on top?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.400
We still have ice cream.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.300
Well, well,
this is getting embarrassing.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.600
- Simon, how could you?
- Well, the ice cream was Marty's idea.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.900
Only the first bowl.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.300
Daphne,
don't go picking on your brother.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.900
I'll just have my tea.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.300
Niles, be a dear
and get me a pillow for my head.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.900
And I wouldn't get too settled in.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.900
You'll need to take me home soon
so I can take my medicine.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.000
I thought I suggested
you bring that with you.

15:55.200 --> 15:59.800
Daphne, dear, aren't you lucky
to be dating a man who's always right?

16:02.800 --> 16:05.700
I'll just go put the kettle on.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.500
Mum, I wish you'd stop
bossing everyone around.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.600
Oh, oh, oh. Listen to my silly girl.

16:10.900 --> 16:15.000
If she knew how to deal with men,
she'd have a husband by now.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.300
Pillow for you, dear. Here you go.

16:17.500 --> 16:22.100
Just rest your head, and I'll, uh, see
how Frasier's doing with the kettle.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.100
Rose, you're looking fit.

16:25.900 --> 16:29.800
You know, I'd have gone too
if I'd known you were going to dinner.

So you can just lay off.

You what?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.100
I thought you would wait
for my return.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.800
Oh, well. Let's have another go, then,
for old times' sake.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.200
- We never had a go.
- We didn't?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.700
Who was that, then?

For the last five days that woman
has made my life a living hell.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.600
You wanna trade?

17:01.800 --> 17:05.300
Simon put my 65-dollar apricot
skin polish on his muffins.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.300
Simon is a boor,
but at least he's not cruel.

17:10.700 --> 17:14.500
You hear the way she talks to Daphne,
and Daphne just takes it.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.300
Well, it's understandable, Niles.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.000
I mean, after all,
she only sees her mother rarely.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.200
I suppose it's just easier
to bite her tongue

17:23.400 --> 17:26.099
than to engage
in some kind of ugly confrontation.

17:26.400 --> 17:31.000
Well, maybe so, but it's just frustrating
to see Daphne so timid.

I wish she'd stand up for herself,
stand up for us.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.900

I just might.

Well, I'm sure she will
when the time is right.

you'd have something nicer
for your guests who smoke.

who smoke do so on the balcony.
