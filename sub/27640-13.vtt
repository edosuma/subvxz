WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:03.545
(Birds chirping)

00:03.545 --> 00:06.298
- Dobro jutro, my darlings!

00:06.298 --> 00:07.966
That, of course,
is good morning in--

00:07.966 --> 00:10.135
- Bosnian.
- We know!

00:10.135 --> 00:12.221
- Well, I happened upon
the most charming

00:12.221 --> 00:14.598
petite patisserie this morning,
and I thought,

00:14.598 --> 00:18.143
my children deserve breakfast
in bed!

00:18.143 --> 00:21.021
- Okay, have we done something?
I'm so confused.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.314
- What do you want?

00:22.314 --> 00:24.149
- Just to be near you.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.777
Chalk it up to the heightened
emotionality of opening night

00:26.777 --> 00:28.779
just around the corner, and...

00:28.779 --> 00:31.949
and my bebe girl
leaving me so soon!

00:31.949 --> 00:34.451
- Okay. Thank you so much.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.828
- I'm not convinced.
Moira: My pleasure.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.581
Oh! And the programs
arrived today.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.541
- Can't wait to see them.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.044
- 500 shiny new programs.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.463
- Aren't these just the
cinnamon buns from the lobby?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.923
- And wouldn't you know it,

00:47.923 --> 00:51.426
they have presented themselves
unfolded.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.388
- Oh no, so you have
to fold them all?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.973
- Theoretically.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.724
But then you remember
my crippling carpal tunnel

00:57.724 --> 01:01.728
from all those years
of signing cheques.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.272
- So why don't I grab you
a big stack,

01:03.272 --> 01:05.440
and you two can turn it
into a fun game.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.942
- I'm out for the afternoon.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.278
Patrick is taking me
on a picnic.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.321
- Hm.
- Then Alexis,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.865
perhaps you can bring
a few hundred to the cafe,

01:13.865 --> 01:15.617
and you and Twyla
can gossip and fold,

01:15.617 --> 01:16.910
and fold and gossip?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.662
- Nope, this is my one
day off,

01:18.662 --> 01:19.871
and Ted and I are doing
trip stuff.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.456
- They need to be folded!

01:21.456 --> 01:24.584
and I brought you pastries,
and coffees!

01:24.584 --> 01:25.961
- Okay well, this coffee
has nothing in it.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.921
- Oh, it's just a gesture,
David!

01:27.921 --> 01:30.757
Stop being so literal.
- Okay...

01:30.757 --> 01:35.345
♪♪♪

01:36.722 --> 01:38.557
(Birds chirp)

01:38.557 --> 01:40.559
(Door clicks open, slams)

01:40.559 --> 01:43.729
- Hey, what are we doing
over here?

01:43.729 --> 01:46.315
- Well, Galapagos has some
pretty killer beaches,

01:46.315 --> 01:48.108
so I thought we should
come prepared.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.319
- Oh my God, Turkish Cosmo
once included my photo

01:50.319 --> 01:52.612
on their list of the world's
best sarongs.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.032
So let's just say I know
my way around a beach.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.993
- (Laughs) All right, uh...
goggles, snorkels.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.911
- I don't actually go
in the open water,

01:59.911 --> 02:02.039
but I can't wait to see
you do that.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.458
What else?
- We got lots of stuff.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.627
Biodegradable shampoo, and...

02:07.627 --> 02:10.255
malaria pills.
- Excuse me?!

02:10.255 --> 02:11.840
- Uh no,
they're just preventative.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.593
We'll also be bringing
insect repellant.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.471
- Okay. Maybe we can just get
one of those sexy

02:17.471 --> 02:19.890
little mosquito nets
for around our bed?

02:19.890 --> 02:22.225
- Those are actually
an insane safety hazard.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.644
If they catch fire,
you're basically trapped

02:23.644 --> 02:25.312
in a burning cage, so.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.064
But, totally.
- (Alexis whimpers)

02:27.064 --> 02:28.690
- Actually, you know what?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.192
Why don't we go grab
some breakfast,

02:30.192 --> 02:32.486
and I will tell you more
about our bed there,

02:32.486 --> 02:34.905
and what we'll be doing in it.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.323
- Theodore!

02:36.323 --> 02:38.283
Look at this romantic
getaway you've planned.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.868
- It's gonna be the best.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.411
We've just gotta make a quick
pitstop at the doctor's,

02:41.411 --> 02:43.705
to get some vaccines,
and then we'll grab a bite.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.500
- Okay, part of me is wondering
if we even need the vaccines?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.126
- No, it's just a quick
needle, Alexis.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.003
Think of it like um,
getting Botox.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.465
- Ew, Ted! What am I, 32?

02:53.465 --> 02:55.675
Oof!

02:55.675 --> 02:57.177
(Car rumbles)

02:58.762 --> 03:00.389
(Engine shuts off)

03:00.389 --> 03:02.808
Patrick: Oh.
David: Sure.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.603
(Door slams)

03:06.603 --> 03:08.313
- Hey, what are we doing?
- We're here.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.858
- Yeah, I just sorta feel like
picnicking by the side

03:11.858 --> 03:15.112
of the road is basically
an invitation to be murdered.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.197
- We're going on a hike, David.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.573
What, you always say
you wanna do more

03:18.573 --> 03:20.158
physical activity, right?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.993
- Yes, so that you can tell me
I don't need to!

03:21.993 --> 03:23.412
I thought we were going
on a picnic.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.414
- We are. We just have
to hike to get there.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.873
- Yeah, I was picturing
us like,

03:26.873 --> 03:28.917
on a charming park bench
in the middle

03:28.917 --> 03:31.169
of a private English garden.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.880
- David, you have to stop
watching "Notting Hill".

03:33.880 --> 03:36.425
It's not helpful
for our relationship.

03:36.425 --> 03:39.428
- Okay. Speak for yourself.
- There you go.

03:39.428 --> 03:42.431
- What is this?
- That's your picnic basket.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.974
We're gonna need our hands free
for the--

03:43.974 --> 03:46.476
- For the hike.
- Hey, you're gonna love this.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.353
Trust me.
- Will I?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.982
(Groans)
(Car alarm beeps on)

03:51.982 --> 03:53.859
- Let's go, David!

03:53.859 --> 03:57.487
(Bird caws)

03:57.487 --> 03:58.905
(Insects buzz,
woodpecker pecks)

04:00.323 --> 04:02.659
- Okay.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.453
That's it.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.456
- Oh, look at you, John,
my handsome proletarian.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.749
All rumpled and sweaty.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.752
- Well, I'd be less sweaty if
Roland hadn't just stood there

04:12.752 --> 04:15.547
and watched me load all
the furniture onto his truck.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.884
- Johnny, I am loaning you
my truck.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.302
And besides, I think you'd
look good

04:20.302 --> 04:22.179
with a little working-man
glow on you.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.473
I could do without the musky
aroma though, whew!

04:24.473 --> 04:25.974
- You know, Moira,
when you said you needed

04:25.974 --> 04:27.934
a few pieces of furniture
from the motel

04:27.934 --> 04:29.769
to round out the set
for Cabaret,

04:29.769 --> 04:31.480
I didn't think you'd be
robbing us blind.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.691
- According to Mrs. Rose,
our motel is the only place

04:34.691 --> 04:38.361
sad enough to pass for
a pre-war Berlin brothel.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.905
- (Exhales deeply)

04:39.905 --> 04:41.490
- Are you okay, Mr. Rose?

04:41.490 --> 04:43.700
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll be fine.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.244
Uh, Moira, what else?
Anything else I can do?

04:46.244 --> 04:48.371
- If you'll just get this
seating chart to the truck,

04:48.371 --> 04:50.165
you'll be then free
as a bird.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.209
Until we get to the theatre.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.711
- Yeah, I'll spot you, Johnny.
Lift with your legs.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.421
- (Grunts with effort)
- There you go.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.924
- Ah! Oh!
- Oh John, be careful!

04:58.924 --> 05:01.259
It's a rental.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.594
it slipped right
through my fingers.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.221
- Just like your youth,
right, old man?

05:05.805 --> 05:07.098
- Mr. Rose, do you think
maybe you should...

05:07.098 --> 05:08.683
just take a seat for a second?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.644
- Uh... okay.
Just for a minute, though.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.062
I'm good.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.523
- Wow, Johnny, are you okay?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.608
- How long has this affliction
been operative?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.693
- Yeah, I felt a little
tightening this morning,

05:18.693 --> 05:20.487
Moira, when I picked up
that box of programs

05:20.487 --> 05:22.822
from the printer's,
but I'm good.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.908
- John, how was I to know
you were in peril?

05:24.908 --> 05:28.411
You keep everything inside,
like a bashful clam!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.038
- Okay, Mrs. Rose, I think
maybe we should take him

05:30.038 --> 05:31.790
to the hospital.
- That sounds alarmist.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.333
Right, John?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.252
- It's just a little muscle
pull, that's all, Moira.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.836
- Yeah, you know, my cousin,
Lenny,

05:36.836 --> 05:38.672
had the same exact thing,
Johnny.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.549
- Well, what did your cousin
do? Can we call him?

05:40.549 --> 05:42.676
- (Sighs) You can try, I don't
think you'll have much luck.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.302
The poor guy died
of a heart attack.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.513
- What? No!

05:46.513 --> 05:49.182
John? John,
can you hear me?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.727
Can you hear me? Try to follow
the sound of my voice.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.480
- Moira, I'm gonna need
your voice to take five

05:55.480 --> 05:57.107
for a minute, thank you.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.025
- Okay, I really think we
should go to the hospital.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.361
- Okay, you know what?
I think...

06:01.361 --> 06:03.905
I think may-maybe
it's time to go.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.032
- Okay, no one panic.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.201
Okay Stevie, get your car.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.828
John's a slow driver.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.080
We'll leave
the programs behind.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.790
Or maybe we'll bring
a stack for the trip?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.001
- N-no, Mrs. Rose!
- You're right.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.794
Everybody move!
- Okay.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.920
- No! Not you, John!

06:22.007 --> 06:23.633
(Dog barks)

06:23.633 --> 06:26.052
Twyla: So this card means luck.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.097
I think. And...
- What's going on here?

06:29.097 --> 06:30.765
Twy, I didn't know you
played solitaire.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.767
- I don't. These are tarot
cards.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.436
I'm raising money
for a new dishwasher,

06:34.436 --> 06:36.438
so I'm offering five dollar
card readings.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.981
- Yeah, and she's good too.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.858
Last time she told me
I was in for a bit of luck,

06:39.858 --> 06:41.651
and I won ten bucks
on a lotto ticket.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.778
- Whoa!
- I spent $20, but...

06:43.778 --> 06:45.071
still.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.198
- Ahem!

06:47.198 --> 06:49.451
Um, so where did you learn
how to tell fortunes, Twy?

06:49.451 --> 06:52.037
- Oh, one of my mom's
ex-boyfriends was a magician,

06:52.037 --> 06:53.663
and a gambling addict.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.999
But he was also really good
at reading tarot cards.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.500
He predicted when he was going
to leave my mom

06:57.500 --> 06:59.377
like, to the day.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.255
- Yeah, that's kinda why
I don't love this stuff.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.757
It can really mess
with your head.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.550
- Babe. It's for charity.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.385
Twyla needs someone
to wash her dishes.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.179
- No, no, the restaurant
needs a new appliance.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.972
- Oh, okay.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.974
Well, you should probably
get your story straight

07:12.974 --> 07:14.976
if you're getting people
to donate money, though.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.603
Come on, it'll be fun.
- Oh, okay, fine.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.979
But only because
it's for a good cause.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.148
- Yay!
- Okay...

07:21.566 --> 07:23.276
Place your hands on the deck,

07:23.276 --> 07:24.903
and think about something
you want.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.364
- (Giggles)

07:27.364 --> 07:28.948
- Okay.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.534
(Cards tap)

07:36.539 --> 07:38.583
- Hm...

07:38.583 --> 07:40.251
- Is something wrong, Twy?

07:40.251 --> 07:41.836
- Is there water near where
you're going?

07:41.836 --> 07:43.380
- Yeah, we're going
to an island.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.715
- Ooh! I forgot it
was an island!

07:45.715 --> 07:47.634
- And are there boats
near the water?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.011
- Yeah, there are boats
on the water.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.013
Oh, we can charter this
catamaran at sunset.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.973
- Yeah, so I see
a boat capsizing.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.850
- What?
- People screaming.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.853
And a couple,
like, under water.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.106
And then it sort of
fades to black.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.108
- Oh my God! Ted!

08:03.108 --> 08:05.026
- Okay no, wait come on,
you can't actually see that

08:05.026 --> 08:06.486
in these cards.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.279
- Well, I also need
to interpret the cards.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.907
- Okay, so maybe you could
interpret something

08:10.907 --> 08:13.284
a little more positive?

08:14.661 --> 08:17.622
- Oh, I also see a party.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.417
People dressed up
all fancy in black.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.876
- Like a black
and white party?

08:21.876 --> 08:24.421
- Mm, more like a funeral.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.339
- (Groans)

08:26.339 --> 08:28.049
- Okay, there's no service here.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.718
- David, put your phone down.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.428
We don't need service,
we have each other.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.096
- Well, if you can track my
eBay bid, then, by all means.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.933
Did we really need two
backpacks?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.727
I mean, what are you keeping
in these things?

08:38.727 --> 08:40.395
- Well, you had a pretty
long list,

08:40.395 --> 08:41.730
and we needed ice packs
to keep the cheese

08:41.730 --> 08:43.356
that you requested cold.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.941
- Well, did I get the ice pack
one?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.943
Because this is not light.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.862
Just wonder why we couldn't
have found a meadow somewhere,

08:48.862 --> 08:50.905
you know, with some men
on horseback like,

08:50.905 --> 08:52.532
trotting in the background.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.367
- Okay, David, do you want
to turn around?!

08:54.367 --> 08:56.119
- Well, the app that's counting
my steps isn't working,

08:56.119 --> 08:57.620
so I honestly don't know.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.164
- You know what?

08:59.164 --> 09:00.874
I got up early to pack
these bags for us

09:00.874 --> 09:02.959
because I thought this would be
a fun thing to do together,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.462
but obviously that
was a mistake.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.839
- Okay, wow. So then,
let's keep going, then.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.716
- Well no, 'cause there's like,
another half an hour to go.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.634
So I think it's probably better
if we just call it now,

09:11.634 --> 09:13.636
and forget about the picnic.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.638
- Okay, well, we can't forget
about the picnic,

09:15.638 --> 09:18.433
because I will need to eat
at some point soon.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.268
- Really?!

09:20.268 --> 09:22.187
- Okay! I love that you've done
this for us,

09:22.187 --> 09:24.647
and I think you look very
dashing in your hiking clothes.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.691
It's just a long way to go
for some cheese.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.151
- Then let's turn around,
David.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.070
Because honestly, I-- ohh!
- Where's the bear?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.864
- No, I stepped on a branch.
It went right through my shoe.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.617
- How do you know that it went
through your shoe?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.243
- (Whimpers)
- Okay, everybody calm down.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.870
It's gonna be fine.
- Uh-huh.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.122
- Uh-huh? So that-we should go
to the...

09:41.122 --> 09:43.583
- Okay. This way.
- It's right in the soft part.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.834
- Yeah, I can see that.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.461
(Siren wails)

09:48.463 --> 09:50.673
- Okay, why?
Why are we still waiting?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.300
- Moira, it's a hospital.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.094
Why don't you sit down,
sweetheart?

09:54.094 --> 09:57.055
- John? John,
I have sentiments that I...

09:57.055 --> 09:59.099
that I often say to myself,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.892
and I don't say them
out loud to you,

10:00.892 --> 10:02.685
and I'd like you to hear them.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.854
- Well, there are people
around, Moira,

10:04.854 --> 10:07.023
so depending on what it is
you're planning on saying.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.067
- I have given far too much

10:10.902 --> 10:13.738
attention to this bicorn
of a show.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.573
And I want you to know, John,

10:15.573 --> 10:17.700
that you are the most important
thing in this world to me,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.327
you know that, don't you?

10:19.327 --> 10:21.663
And I include Caroline in that,

10:21.663 --> 10:23.331
and I've had that wig
for 40-years.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.166
- You don't have to be doing
this, Moira.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.919
- John, if you make it through--
- When!

10:27.919 --> 10:30.088
- When what?
- When he pulls through!

10:30.088 --> 10:32.465
- Yes! Everything will change,
John.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.384
We are going to eat healthier,

10:34.384 --> 10:37.554
no-well, not-less,
less wine at dinner.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.097
I'll have to keep the pills,

10:39.097 --> 10:40.557
but I'm not one
who's the health risk here.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.308
- Mrs. Rose, you really need
to sit down,

10:42.308 --> 10:43.768
because at this point
I feel like

10:43.768 --> 10:45.436
I am at risk of heart failure.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.689
- Okay, I've been calling
David, and he's not picking up!

10:47.689 --> 10:49.107
- And what about Alexis?

10:49.107 --> 10:51.109
- There's an idea.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.570
Anybody have her number?
- I'll text her.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.738
- Okay, Johnny, um...

10:55.738 --> 10:58.449
I figured you were probably
hungry, so um,

10:58.449 --> 11:00.618
I got you some snacks;
here's some chips.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.203
And then, this, Johnny,
is an energy drink.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.038
So that you can stay awake.
- No!

11:04.038 --> 11:05.790
He shouldn't be having
any of that.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.750
Will you stop going
to the vending machine?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.794
- I'm sorry, Stevie,
hospitals make me nervous.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.046
The last time I was in one
was with Lenny.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.965
Although he didn't stay
very long.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.383
- Oh my God!
- What is wrong with you?!

11:15.383 --> 11:16.551
- Hm?

11:16.551 --> 11:18.553
- Okay, Johnny Rose?
- Yeah.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.888
- Here.
- Hi, I'm Doctor Lipman.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.681
We're gonna take you back
for some tests.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.932
- Good.
- Is "tests" code

11:22.932 --> 11:24.767
for open heart surgery?
You can tell me,

11:24.767 --> 11:26.227
I once played a nurse
on "M.A.S.H."

11:26.227 --> 11:28.104
- Okay, is it a heart attack?
- At this point,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.689
we just want to find out
what's going on.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.108
- Mr. Rose. Okay.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.860
- You're gonna be okay.
- I'll be fine.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.612
- Okay.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.197
- Be careful with him.
Precious cargo.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.578
- Whoa, whoa, Moira.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.288
Too soon, too soon.
Come on.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.667
- Ugh.
- Okay, David,

11:49.667 --> 11:51.377
I need you to pull it out.
- Okay, I told you

11:51.377 --> 11:52.879
I don't think that's
a good idea.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.464
- What, you think leaving it in
is a better idea?!

11:54.464 --> 11:55.840
I would do it myself,

11:55.840 --> 11:57.550
but it needs to be pulled
straight out.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.718
- Okay!
- Just pull it out, David!

11:58.718 --> 12:00.094
- Oh my God!
- Straight out.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.888
Eyes need to be open, please.
- Ss! Shh...

12:01.888 --> 12:03.473
Shh for a second.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.266
(Exhales deeply) Okay.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.477
Is it bleeding?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.687
- I don't know, my shoe is on!
- Okay.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.272
- Yeah, I don't see anything,

12:11.272 --> 12:12.815
but we should still put
something on it,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.567
because I don't trust where
that stick has been.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.693
Now, which of these backpacks
have the first aid kit in it?

12:17.320 --> 12:19.822
- I didn't bring one.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.866
It was either the first aid
kit, or the ice packs.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.787
I wanna go home, David!
This whole day's been a bust.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.622
- Well, that's not happening,
so...

12:27.622 --> 12:29.582
- What is that?
- It's hand sanitizer,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.376
it can be used
as a disinfectant.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.294
You think I'd come to a picnic
without it?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.381
Okay, there we go.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.924
We'll reapply later,

12:37.924 --> 12:39.842
but at least I don't have
to worry about gangrene.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.723
I'm sorry for not appreciating
you enough today.

12:45.723 --> 12:49.227
You've packed two big
backpacks full of food,

12:49.227 --> 12:51.896
and not a Band-aid to be found
in either of them, but still.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.234
If you wanna keep hiking,
I think we should keep hiking.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.403
- No, I don't think so.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.363
But thank you.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.614
I think I sorta killed
the romance.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.282
- No, you didn't.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.243
You planned this beautiful
day for us.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.537
And I think we should
finish it.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.664
Can you walk?

13:09.664 --> 13:12.125
- Yeah, I think so.
- Then we keep going.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.545
Also, I'm starving,
and I need to eat something.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.131
(Sighs)

13:19.799 --> 13:21.300
- I should probably get out
in front, David.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.385
You have no idea
where you're going.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.470
- Okay. That's fair.
- Ow!

13:24.470 --> 13:26.639
- (Insects buzz, dog barks)

13:27.765 --> 13:28.933
- Hey!

13:28.933 --> 13:31.853
- Hey.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.396
- Whatcha doin' there?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.148
- Um, just being on
the internet.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.818
- Alexis, that's just
an image search for...

13:38.818 --> 13:40.778
intense boating disasters?

13:40.778 --> 13:42.363
- I just wanted to know
what I would look like

13:42.363 --> 13:45.033
after a catamaran accident.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.201
- Come on, you can't tell me
that you actually believe

13:47.201 --> 13:48.911
Twyla's card reading.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.580
- Of course not.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.915
We're just like,
super-duper sure

13:52.915 --> 13:54.917
that this is the vacation
we want to be taking?

13:54.917 --> 13:57.670
- What? This is not a vacation.
I'm going for work.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.547
And look, if you're scared
of drowning,

13:59.547 --> 14:01.299
we don't have to go on
the catamaran tour.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.342
- Oh, it's more than that, Ted.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.011
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.929
I've been travelling the world
since I was a teen model.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.307
But something about this
just feels different.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.850
- Is this about
the juice stand?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.602
Because I told you,
we can just make our own.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.645
There's fruit literally
everywhere.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.523
- Okay, this might sound
insane,

14:17.523 --> 14:20.109
but I've had this like,
nagging feeling

14:20.109 --> 14:22.153
that as soon as I get there,

14:22.153 --> 14:24.697
I'm gonna start thinking
about my family.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.825
- That-that doesn't sound
insane.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.119
- Okay, maybe I'm not
expressing myself clearly.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.622
Like, I will physically
be there,

14:32.622 --> 14:35.625
but I will be thinking
about them here.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.335
- Right, so...

14:37.335 --> 14:40.421
what you're describing
is missing someone,

14:40.421 --> 14:42.799
and it is a totally
normal feeling.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.092
- Well, this is a new feeling
for me, Ted!

14:45.635 --> 14:47.637
What if something happens
to David?

14:47.637 --> 14:50.139
I'm basically his only friend.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.225
Or my Dad.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.519
David and my mom sometimes
gang up on him,

14:54.519 --> 14:56.479
and I'm basically
his only friend.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.731
- Okay, Alexis,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.399
you are taking a step
out of the nest

15:00.399 --> 15:01.526
for the first time in a while,

15:01.526 --> 15:04.278
and that's a good thing.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.989
And if we get there,
and we hate it,

15:06.989 --> 15:09.033
well, we'll probably have
to wait it out a bit,

15:09.033 --> 15:10.868
just because it's pretty
far away,

15:10.868 --> 15:12.578
and it would be pretty tough
to re-book

15:12.578 --> 15:13.663
our travel arrangements, but...

15:13.663 --> 15:15.289
if we still hate it after that,

15:15.289 --> 15:16.999
we can just come home.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.627
- You're right.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.297
- Oh, no, no,
we're gonna close that now.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.424
'Cause there are somre pretty
disturbing images on there.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.634
Oh God!

15:26.634 --> 15:28.719
(Tablet clatters)

15:28.719 --> 15:30.304
Man on PA: Dr. Stevens,
Room One.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.098
- Well, you know, uh...

15:32.098 --> 15:33.850
I'm just gonna go ahead
and say it.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.060
It's been a long time,

15:36.060 --> 15:38.437
that's usually not a good sign.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.523
- Roland.
- Hmm?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.650
- I don't think Mrs. Rose
needs to hear that right now.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.696
- In the Balkan Peninsula
they say,

15:46.696 --> 15:49.824
"silence is but an empty
serving platter."

15:49.824 --> 15:52.076
I'm sure there's a deluge
of benign reasons

15:52.076 --> 15:54.203
they're keeping John
back there.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.080
- Yeah, I'm sure.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.623
He-he probably just roped them

15:57.623 --> 15:59.333
into one of his longwinded
stories.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.294
- (Chuckles)

16:01.294 --> 16:03.838
- Or he could be on a table
with a triple bypass.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.798
- Mr. Rose is gonna be fine,
he has to be.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.343
(Exhales) I mean, I can't be
left alone with this motel.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.053
I don't do math.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.763
(Door bangs)

16:12.763 --> 16:14.390
Dr. Lipman: Hey, folks.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.392
I have an update on Mr. Rose's
condition for you.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.187
We did an endoscopy,
and found it was in fact

16:19.187 --> 16:20.771
severe heartburn.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.773
We gave him an antacid,
a strong one,

16:22.773 --> 16:24.358
and he's doing just fine.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.818
- (Laughs)

16:25.818 --> 16:27.028
Johnny: And I drained
a 20-footer,

16:27.028 --> 16:29.280
and finished with an eagle.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.324
- John! You scared me!

16:31.324 --> 16:33.576
- Oh Johnny, I thought this
was the end of the road

16:33.576 --> 16:35.786
for you, pal! Ohhh!

16:35.786 --> 16:37.788
You're a blessing, my friend!

16:37.788 --> 16:40.541
A blessing! A real blessing.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.501
You are.
- Thank you, Roland.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.462
- Ohhh...

16:44.462 --> 16:47.131
- Mr. Rose needs to lay off
the morning cinnamon buns,

16:47.131 --> 16:49.675
and steer clear of acidic foods
for a while.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.510
But apart from that,
he's good to go.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.137
- Is he, then?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.264
- Well, he did say
that there have been

16:55.264 --> 16:57.892
some fatal cases...
of heartburn.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.645
- Did I?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.146
- Is everything okay, Stevie?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.815
- Yep, I'm just really not
looking forward

17:04.815 --> 17:06.776
to folding those programs.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.112
It's good to have you back,
Mr. Rose.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.531
- Well, it's good to be back.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.326
And thank you, Doctor.
I'll have to call you

17:15.326 --> 17:17.745
with the rest of that
Pebble Beach story.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.872
- Oh John, the man's done
enough!

17:25.836 --> 17:28.172
- David, I'm fine.
- You were limping,

17:28.172 --> 17:29.966
and the rest of the hike
would've made it worse.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.592
Plus, you don't want to know
what my Mom would do

17:31.592 --> 17:33.386
if you showed up to opening
night, and couldn't walk.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.763
Oh, okay.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.931
Oh boy.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.559
(Sighs)

17:40.559 --> 17:42.103
Oh... oh!

17:44.355 --> 17:46.190
Well, this is nice.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.858
- I wouldn'tve made you
hike all this way

17:47.858 --> 17:49.777
if I didn't think it
was gonna be worth it.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.113
I know you a little better
than that.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.615
- Okay, so how should I set up
the picnic?

17:54.615 --> 17:56.409
- Yeah, I think it might be
a bit late for that.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.286
Why don't we uh,

17:58.286 --> 18:00.121
why don't we just take in
the view for a little while,

18:00.121 --> 18:02.248
and then we'll save the picnic
for another day?

18:02.248 --> 18:04.166
- Okay, I didn't carry you
up a mountain

18:04.166 --> 18:06.836
not to eat cheese after, so...

18:06.836 --> 18:08.462
- I don't know, David.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.256
- Okay, just tell me what to do,
and I'll set it all up!

18:13.342 --> 18:15.761
- Okay, fine. Um...

18:15.761 --> 18:17.805
in the red bag
there's a blanket,

18:17.805 --> 18:20.099
you can take that out
and lay it down,

18:20.099 --> 18:22.476
- Okay.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.811
This is nice.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.980
- Uh, in the second bag,
there is a bundle

18:25.980 --> 18:27.815
of crackers and cheese.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.235
- Uh... excuse moi!

18:32.862 --> 18:34.363
- And champagne.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.282
- Hmm!

18:36.282 --> 18:38.951
- And uh, just one more thing.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.579
Um, if you go into that
front pocket there,

18:41.579 --> 18:43.122
there's actually something.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.959
(Rustling)

18:48.711 --> 18:50.296
- Get it open.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.424
(Pants)

18:53.424 --> 18:55.301
(Half laughs, half sobs)

18:55.301 --> 18:57.136
What's going on?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.513
- So I used to come
on this hike a lot,

18:59.513 --> 19:01.849
when I first moved here,
and I was uh,

19:01.849 --> 19:03.392
I was developing feelings
for this guy

19:03.392 --> 19:05.394
I had just gotten
into business with.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.189
And... I didn't know
what to do about it

19:08.189 --> 19:10.775
because I didn't know
if that guy

19:11.692 --> 19:13.653
had the same feelings.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.696
Or if I'd ever be able
to muster up the courage

19:15.696 --> 19:18.074
to let him know how I felt.
- (Emotional exhale)

19:18.074 --> 19:20.701
- And now, here he is.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.079
The love of my life,

19:23.079 --> 19:24.664
standing in front of me.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.416
- (Sobs)

19:27.416 --> 19:28.793
- And this just felt like
the perfect place

19:28.793 --> 19:30.461
to ask you to marry me.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.214
- (Sobs)

19:34.799 --> 19:37.093
Wha-are you sure?

19:38.636 --> 19:40.388
- Easiest decision of my life.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.223
- (Laughs)

19:42.223 --> 19:43.808
- Mm!

19:44.892 --> 19:47.019
(Both laugh)

19:49.939 --> 19:52.024
- Are these 24-karat?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.402
It's a yes, it's a yes!
I love you.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.197
(Both laugh)

20:02.034 --> 20:04.245
(Bell on door jingles)

20:04.245 --> 20:06.080
- Hey, Twy.
- Alexis.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.873
Hey, what's up?

20:07.873 --> 20:09.792
- Nothing, I was just on my way
back from Ted's,

20:09.792 --> 20:12.378
and I thought I'd pop in
and see how you're doing, girl.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.005
Good shift?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.424
- Is this about the card
reading earlier?

20:16.424 --> 20:18.259
- What? No.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.927
I've been thinking about
the card reading earlier,

20:19.927 --> 20:21.929
and I just feel like it
wasn't the greatest send off,

20:21.929 --> 20:24.515
you know? So hopefully I'll
get a better one this time,

20:24.515 --> 20:27.268
and it will just like,
erase the other one.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.061
- I'd be glad to do it, Alexis,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.313
but I should warn you,

20:31.313 --> 20:33.107
I think the deck may be cursed.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.359
I predicted four other
drownings today.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.194
- Okay, well maybe you should
get a new deck.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.655
- Death aside, your last
reading was really good.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.615
- It was?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.784
- You guys got up from the
table before I could get to it.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.286
I flipped the Ten of Cups.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.289
- And?

20:48.289 --> 20:51.876
- And I saw your family
with this big...

20:51.876 --> 20:54.295
golden ring of light
around them.

20:54.295 --> 20:57.756
Like you all had something
to celebrate.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.008
- Hm.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.885
- It's gonna be a good year,
Alexis.

21:00.885 --> 21:01.844
You're on the right path.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.597
- (Relieved sigh)

21:04.597 --> 21:06.474
Thanks, Twy.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.267
- You're welcome.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.978
And that golden ring
means prosperity.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.521
- Hm.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.273
- Either that or it's a stain
from a beer bottle.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.233
Because my mom's ex
gave me the cards.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.359
- Ew.
