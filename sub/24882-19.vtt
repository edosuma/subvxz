15:38.467 --> 15:39.967
Boo!

15:39.967 --> 15:42.000
Dr. Brownie,
you got distracted.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.600
The ship blew right past you.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.667
You need to stay focused.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.333
You right,
Black Bean Widow!

15:47.333 --> 15:51.200
But what can me do
to help me stay focused?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.834
Try talking to yourself
to stay focused on the ship.

15:54.834 --> 15:57.633
Tell yourself,
"Stay focused
on the ship,

15:57.633 --> 15:59.734
stay focused on the ship."

15:59.734 --> 16:02.700
- Oh, eh, that good
strategy, Mighty Corn.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.734
I shall use my hammer to
get rid of any distractions.

16:06.734 --> 16:09.266

16:55.367 --> 16:57.100

16:57.100 --> 17:00.233
Dr. Brownie got

17:28.200 --> 17:32.133

17:48.300 --> 17:51.467

17:51.467 --> 17:52.600

( "Elmo's Song"
playing on bells )

21:11.767 --> 21:13.166
Hi, Elmo! Look.

21:13.166 --> 21:15.934
I'm dressed up like
my favorite vegetable.

21:15.934 --> 21:18.033
Can you guess what
vegetable I am?

21:18.033 --> 21:21.533
Let's see.
Smartie's, uh...broccoli?

21:21.533 --> 21:24.767
That's right!
Green and delicious
broccoli!

21:24.767 --> 21:26.967
Oh, well, that's
perfect, Smartie,

21:26.967 --> 21:30.033
because Elmo wants to learn
all about vegetables.

21:30.033 --> 21:33.033
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:33.033 --> 21:35.900
All:
We look it up!

21:35.900 --> 21:38.300
Getting to the root
of vegetables.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.900
Here we go!

21:39.900 --> 21:41.934
Smartie: Vegetables come
in all different colors,

21:41.934 --> 21:43.967
shapes, and sizes.

21:43.967 --> 21:46.500
Vegetables grow
in different places.

21:46.500 --> 21:50.300
Root vegetables like carrots
grow under the ground.

21:50.300 --> 21:54.266
Leafy vegetables like spinach
grow above the ground.

21:54.266 --> 21:57.133
After getting plenty
of water and sunlight,

21:57.133 --> 21:59.133
they're ready to be picked.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.967
Sometimes you can eat
vegetables by themselves.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.700
Sometimes they're mixed in
with other foods.

22:04.700 --> 22:08.100
It's important to eat
plenty of vegetables every day.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.834
They keep us healthy
and give us energy!

22:13.400 --> 22:17.600
Ha ha hee! Boy,
Elmo loves vegetables,
Smartie!

22:17.600 --> 22:20.033
Me, too!
See you later, Elmo!

22:20.033 --> 22:22.734
Oh, ho ho!
Oh, thank you, Smartie. Bye-bye!

22:22.734 --> 22:27.200
Boy, there's so many different
kinds of vegetables.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.934
Hey! That gives Elmo an idea!

22:30.934 --> 22:33.700
Oh-ho! Let's play
a game together.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.967
Yeah-eah-eah!
Come on, come on.

22:35.967 --> 22:37.200
Ha ha ha!

22:43.100 --> 22:45.033
Ha ha! Oh!
Elmo wonders

22:45.033 --> 22:48.500
if we can pick the vegetables
and sort them by color.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.533
Are you ready? Let's play.

22:51.533 --> 22:56.734
OK. So we've got celery,
a carrot, and a radish.

22:56.734 --> 23:00.100
The green vegetables
go in the green bin,

23:00.100 --> 23:02.467
orange in the orange,

23:02.467 --> 23:04.233
and red in the red.

23:04.233 --> 23:06.233
- Kids: Ready!

23:06.233 --> 23:08.934
Elmo: OK! Let's start
with the carrot.

23:08.934 --> 23:12.133
Should the carrot go
in the red bin?

23:12.133 --> 23:14.767
Girl: No.
Carrots are orange.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.166
Elmo:
That's right!

23:16.166 --> 23:18.900
Now, what vegetable
should we pick next?

23:18.900 --> 23:20.300
Boy:
The celery.

23:20.300 --> 23:23.333
Which bin should
we put the celery in?

23:23.333 --> 23:26.734
Girl: The green one.
Celery is green.

23:26.734 --> 23:29.734
Yeah! Now where
does the radish go?

23:29.734 --> 23:31.367
Boy:
The red bin.

23:31.367 --> 23:32.934
Yay! We did it!

23:32.934 --> 23:35.266
Wow! Good job!

23:35.266 --> 23:37.900
Boy, Elmo loves vegetables.

23:37.900 --> 23:41.467
Oh, and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:41.467 --> 23:44.400
Does Mr. Noodle know
about vegetables?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.834
Oh. Let's ask him.

23:45.834 --> 23:49.100
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:49.100 --> 23:53.834
Oh, ho ho!
It's Mr. Noodle's
poodle Schmoodle.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.200
- Hi, Schmoodle!
- Boy: Ha ha ha!
Schmoodle!

23:56.200 --> 23:57.800
Elmo was wondering,

23:57.800 --> 24:00.467
does Schmoodle know
about vegetables?

24:01.767 --> 24:03.700
Elmo:
You do? Oh!

24:03.700 --> 24:05.433
Show us a vegetable,
Schmoodle!

24:05.433 --> 24:08.533
Girl: Yeah!
Show us a... cabbage.

24:08.533 --> 24:10.533
Elmo:
Yeah. Show us a cabbage.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.266
Boy:
That's a football.

24:14.266 --> 24:16.533
Boy #2: A football
isn't a vegetable.

24:16.533 --> 24:19.066
Elmo:
A cabbage is leafy and round.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.867
Try again, Schmoodle.

24:22.567 --> 24:24.166
Boy:
Hey. Look!

24:24.166 --> 24:25.567
Elmo:
Is that
a cabbage, Schmoodle?

24:25.567 --> 24:28.266
Girl #2: No,
that's a cheeseburger.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.100
A cheeseburger
isn't a vegetable.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.967
Elmo:
Oh, don't give up.
You can do it.

24:33.967 --> 24:36.033
Show us a cabbage, Schmoodle.

24:36.033 --> 24:37.967
Girl #2: He's pushing
a shopping cart

24:37.967 --> 24:39.533
full of cabbages!

24:39.533 --> 24:42.033
Boy #2: That's right.
Cabbages are vegetables.

24:42.033 --> 24:43.800
Elmo:
Yeah! Now you've got it.
Good work!

24:43.800 --> 24:46.233
- Thank you, Schmoodle.

24:46.233 --> 24:49.900
